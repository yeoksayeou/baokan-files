　　Hungary Will Grow Stronger
　　By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    The winter in Budapest is often shrouded in grey clouds, with no clear distinction between dusk and dawn.

    On Saturday afternoons, most government offices close at two o'clock. People line up at bus stops, and those who live in the suburbs no longer need to rush home before dark, as they did in previous days. After work, they can still go out to take care of their own business. Various vehicles shuttle back and forth across the major bridges over the Danube. We often see truck convoys covered with tarpaulins and loaded with goods, which are the endless streams of support from brotherly countries.

    The nine hundred thousand residents of Buda and Pest, separated by the river, have gradually resumed their normal work and lives after enduring this terror and trauma.

    On the afternoon of December 3rd, the Socialist Workers' Party organizations were still working intensely, and the temporary district committees of several city districts held meetings of party activists. Several members of the Central Executive Committee attended these meetings separately.

    The Ninth District in southern Pest is a working-class district, and today it also held a meeting of grassroots leading cadres of the Party, with about two hundred people participating. The meeting room, which seemed to be temporarily arranged, was already crowded, and the thick smoke made the lights dim. The wall next to the podium was covered with a red cloth, on which hung a white porcelain portrait of Lenin, shining brightly. Above the wall was a banner that read, "Workers of all countries, unite!" Seeing these simple arrangements on such days creates an extraordinary impression in people's minds.

    The district committee secretary first reported on the situation in the district, explained the activities of the workers' committees and the experiences and difficulties in party building work, and mentioned that production in various factories in the district has begun, but due to the lack of fuel and raw materials, production cannot currently be carried out as required by the people's interests.

    Next were the speeches of the comrades present. A responsible comrade from the department store management office emphasized the erroneous actions of some workers' committees, whose leaders attempted to exclude some honest old workers, Communist Party members, and veterans of the workers' movement from the workers' committees, and they also had irresponsible behaviors of wasting enterprise assets. Many party members also adopted a passive wait-and-see attitude towards these phenomena. He requested that the Party organization quickly struggle against these phenomena in the enterprises. Then, other comrades spoke, and they were all concerned about how to work, where to focus their efforts, and asked for answers to some decisive issues in current life.

    Finally, Comrade Marosan, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Party, spoke. People watched and listened to the old fighter's speech with kind eyes. People cared about his prison life in recent years, which had turned his hair grey. But in his manner, one could feel that he was full of fighting strength and passionate emotion. He began by discussing some cognitive problems that had not yet been resolved among the current party members. He first analyzed the nature of the incident, saying that some people call this riot a revolution, which is correct from the perspective of the reactionaries, because this was a planned armed riot by the enemy, who seized radio stations, telephone bureaus, and newspapers on the first day of the incident, destroying red stars, etc., which clearly showed that their purpose was to overthrow our regime. After Cardinal Mindszenty announced that land would be returned to the original owners and factories to the capitalists, people realized how dangerous the situation had become.

    Some people also said that this movement was a democratic movement. Let's recall those terrifying days when the rioters killed people wearing yellow leather shoes as public security personnel. What kind of democracy is this?

    Many people in the party had illusions about Nagy, believing that Nagy was a national hero. What good things did he do? In the last few days of his rule, he blatantly stood with the counter-revolutionaries to undermine the achievements of socialism. Everyone knows that he has now left, "He left us a pot of bitter soup to drink!" All of Nagy's activities were to win people's hearts. Even when Comrade Marosan was released from prison, Nagy said that he had rescued him. Comrade Marosan affirmed: "I don't believe his hypocritical words, I know that it was the spirit of the 20th Congress of the CPSU that saved me."

    In the days when the counter-revolutionaries were rampant, many old parties emerged, and some people also had illusions about these parties, thinking that the Communist Party had not done a single good thing in the past twelve years; then, besides the Communist Party, who else could give workers and peasants these benefits such as land reform and enterprise nationalization?

    He also pointed out that in this party building work, it should be clearly recognized that the Party's failure in the past was not the bankruptcy of the Marxist-Leninist worldview, but the bankruptcy of leadership methods.

    After criticizing the Party's past mistakes, he raised another question.

    Why did such a thing happen in Hungary? He said that the imperialists have been looking for loopholes in the socialist camp, and they have found weaknesses in Hungary that are suitable for them to carry out sabotage work. Due to past erroneous policies that violated national characteristics and ignored the improvement of the living standards of the working class, this violated the purpose of social construction, so the people became dissatisfied with the Party, and some students and workers were used by counter-revolutionaries. But they themselves did not know who they were fighting for, which also reflected the Party's past failures in ideological education.

    People who opposed the Soviet army in the past have gradually understood that this struggle is a matter of two camps. Except for Austria, Hungary is surrounded by socialist countries. The imperialists want to manipulate the Hungarian people and make them tools for imperialism to oppose the Soviet Union, once again involving this region in a European war.

    Finally, when talking about how the current party should work, he said that Comrade Kadar had made a promise on the first day of the new government's establishment, which was the first voice of an honest Communist! (The answer below said, right!) Now we need unity and work, and only in work can we prove who is good and who is bad, who is right and who is wrong (Below said, right! We should work better!)

      When the meeting was adjourned, it was completely dark, but people were reluctant to leave and continued to have some free conversations. I asked a manager of a furniture joint factory next to me what he thought of today's meeting. He said that Comrade Marosan's speech "gave us new strength. The party group meetings in this district have been held twice, and a meeting like today is still the first time. We have been waiting for the party's instructions for a long time, and now we know how to work hard." After speaking, he immediately took out his party membership card, which he had for thirty years, from the pocket of his coat and showed it to me. He explained that the party's paralysis this time was mainly due to the disintegration of the central leadership, which made the lower levels at a loss, but "our belief in Marxism-Leninism will not be shattered by this. On the contrary, from grassroots party members to central leaders, after this painful historical lesson, they have all received the most profound education in class struggle. We will regrow and become stronger."

    Today, the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee composed of Kadar and others have personally suffered from the harm of sectarianism, and in the dark days of October, they also personally experienced the danger of national subjugation and party destruction caused by the surrender policy of nationalists. All the measures taken by the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government in the past four weeks have proved that they have made all the determination to actively correct past mistakes and start all over again.

    The newborn Hungary will surely grow stronger. The Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government has shown the strength to overcome all enemies in the month of struggle since its establishment. Because it is not isolated, it has won the support of the entire socialist camp. (Budapest, December 3)

　　匈牙利将成长得更加坚强
　　本报记者　胡济邦
    布达佩斯的冬天经常笼罩在灰色的云雾中，黄昏和白日没有鲜明的区别。
    星期六的下午二点钟，一般机关的工作都结束了。街上的人们排着候车的行列，住在郊区的人们已不需要像前些日子那样，靠着步行急急忙忙地要在天黑以前走回家去。他们在工作完后还可以上街处理一些自己的事情。各式各样车辆在多瑙河的几条大桥上来回不息地穿梭行驶。我们经常可以看到蒙着布篷满载货物的卡车运输队，那是来自兄弟国家源源不绝的支援队。
    分住在河流两岸的布达和佩斯的九十万居民，经受这次恐怖和创伤之后，已逐渐恢复自己正常的工作和生活了。
    3日下午，社会主义工人党的组织仍在紧张地工作，几个市区的临时区党委分别召开了党员积极分子大会。中央执行委员会的几位委员分头出席了这些大会。
    在佩斯南部的第九区是一个工人区，今天也举行了一个约有二百多人参加的党的基层领导骨干分子大会。一间像是临时布置起来的会议室里，已经挤满了人，腾腾的烟雾使灯光都变得暗淡了。那紧靠讲台的墙壁蒙着一层红色的布幛，上面挂着一帧用白瓷烧制的列宁头像，发出闪闪的光芒，墙壁的上椽挂着一幅“全世界无产阶级联合起来！”的标语。在这样的日子里看到这些虽然是简单的布置，但在人们心中却产生一种不平常的印象。
    区委书记先报告本区情况，对工人委员会的活动和建党工作中的经验和困难作了说明，并提到：本区各工厂的生产都已开始，但由于缺乏燃料和原料，目前还不能如人民利益所要求的那样进行生产。
    接着是在坐同志的发言。一位百货公司营业管理处的负责同志强调指出一些工人委员会的错误行动，他们的领导企图把一些正直的老工人、共产党员和工人运动的老战士从工人委员会中排挤出去，他们也有浪费企业资财的不负责任的行为。并有不少党员对这些现象采取消极观望的态度。他要求党的组织迅速在企业中同这些现象作斗争。接着，其他同志发言，他们一致关心应如何工作，把力量用于何处，要求就目前生活中的一些决定性的问题得到解答。
    最后由党中央的一位执行委员马罗山同志讲话。人们都以亲切的目光注视着和倾听着这位老战士的发言。人们关怀他几年来的监狱生活，已使他的头发变得灰白。但在他的语态中可以感受到他全身充满了战斗的力量和热烈的情感。他从当前党员中间一直还未解决的一些认识问题谈起。他首先分析这次事件的性质说，有人称这次暴动为革命，这从反动者的立场来说是对的，因为这是敌人有计划的武装暴动，他们在事件发生的第一天起就夺取电台、电话局、报馆，捣毁红星等等，已十分明显地说明他们的目的在于推翻我们的政权。在红衣主教明曾蒂宣布土地归还原主、工厂归还资本家后，人们才明白过来事情已发展到怎样危险的境地。
    还有人说，这次运动是民主运动。大家回想一下那些恐怖的日子，暴徒们看到穿黄色皮鞋的人都当作公安部队的人员来屠杀，这是什么民主？
    党内不少人对纳吉存在过或存在着幻想，认为纳吉是民族英雄。他做了些什么好事？在他执政的最后几天露骨地和反革命分子站在一起来搞垮社会主义的成果。大家知道他现在出走了，“他留下了一盆苦汤给我们喝！”纳吉一切活动都是为了收买人心，甚至当马罗山同志出狱时，纳吉说是自己救他出来的。马罗山同志肯定地说：“我才不相信他的伪善的语言，我自己知道是苏共第二十次代表大会的精神挽救了我。”
    在反革命猖狂的日子里，许多旧党派都出现了，有人也对这些党派抱过幻想，认为过去十二年共产党没有做过一点好事；那么难道土地改革、企业国有化，除了共产党之外还有谁能给工人和农民这些好处吗？
    他又指出，在这次建党工作中应该认识清楚，党在过去的失败不是马列主义世界观的破产，而是领导方法的破产。
    他在批判了党在过去的错误后又提出了一个问题。
    为什么在匈牙利发生这样的事情？他说，帝国主义者一直在社会主义阵营中寻找缺口，他们曾在匈牙利找到了适合于他们进行破坏工作的弱点。由于过去的错误政策违背了民族特点，忽视了工人阶级的生活水平的提高，这就违背了社会建设的目的，因而人民对党发生不满，有一部分学生和工人被反革命分子利用了。但他们自己还不知道是为谁而斗争，这也反映了党在过去思想教育方面的过失。
    过去反对苏军的人现在已逐渐懂得这次斗争是关系两个阵营的问题，匈牙利周围除了奥地利以外，都是社会主义国家，帝国主义者想摆弄匈牙利的人民，使他们成为帝国主义反苏的工具，再一次使这个地区卷入全欧洲的战火之中。
    最后谈到现在的党应该怎样工作时，他说卡达尔同志在新政府成立的第一天已发出诺言，这是正直的共产党人的第一声！（下面回答说，对！）现在就需要团结，工作，在工作中才能证明谁好谁坏，谁是谁非（下面说，对！我们应该更好地
  工作！）
      宣布散会时，天已完全黑了，但人们还不愿离去，继续作了一些自
  由的交谈。我问旁边一位家具联合工厂的管理人，对今天的大会有什么意见，他说马罗山同志的发言“给了我们新的力量，本区的党员小组会已开过两次了，像今天这样的大会还是第一次，我们早已等待着党的指示，现在知道如何去努力了。”说完他马上从自己上衣的口袋中取出他有了三十年党龄的党证给我看，他解释说这次党的瘫痪主要是由于中央领导的瓦解使下面无所适从，但是“我们对于马克思列宁主义的信仰是不会因此而破灭的，相反地，从基层党员到中央领导，经过这次惨痛历史的教训，都受到一次最深刻的阶级斗争的教育。我们将重新生长，并且更加坚强。”
    今天以卡达尔等人组成的党中央的领导同志，都曾亲身遭受过宗派主义者的残害，在十月的黑暗日子里，也亲自经历过民族主义者的投降政策导致亡国亡党的危险。四个星期以来工农革命政府所采取的一切措施，都证明了他们对积极纠正过去的错误已下了一切从头做起的决心。
    新生的匈牙利一定能生长得更加坚强。工农革命政府在成立以来一个月的斗争中，已显示出了足以战胜一切敌人的力量。因为它不是孤立的，它获得了整个社会主义阵营的支持。（12月3日于布达佩斯）
