Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 16th - This year in Shanxi Province, among the 54 civilian coal mines newly built, restored, and rebuilt in the Taihang, Hengshan, and Zhongtiao mountain areas, 39 have been completed and have begun to supply large quantities of coal for civilian use this winter. It is expected that by the end of December, three more coal mines will complete their reconstruction projects and commence production.

40% of these coal mines are distributed in areas such as Pian Guan and Xing County in northwestern Shanxi, where it is usually difficult to obtain coal. After all the coal mines are put into production, they can increase the supply of civilian coal for farmers in Shanxi Province by 749,000 tons per year.

    给农民建设的煤矿
    新华社太原16日电　山西省今年在太行、恒山和中条等山区新建、恢复和改建的五十四座民用煤矿，有三十九座已经完工，并且开始大量供应冬季民用煤。预计在12月底，还将有三个煤矿完成改建工程投入生产。
    这些煤矿有40％是分布在平常用煤困难的晋西北偏关、兴县等地区。全部煤矿投入生产以后，每年可以为山西省农民增加七十四万九千吨民用煤。
