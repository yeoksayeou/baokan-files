Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: The industrial construction in various ethnic minority areas across the country is developing from nothing to something, from small to big.

    When Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was first established, it had fewer than sixty workshops. The only things that could barely be called modern industry were a few small, dilapidated power plants and a wool mill. Now, modern factories are being built one after another. Besides the forestry industry, the entire autonomous region has over three hundred factories of various sizes. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, more than a hundred industrial enterprises of considerable scale, including iron and steel, machine manufacturing, textiles, and leather and fur, have been established successively north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. This year alone, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture has newly built and expanded more than forty factories and mines. On the grasslands in Sichuan Province, where the Red Army passed during the Long March, several dairy processing plants, power plants, and coal mines are also under construction and preparation. The industrial output value of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province accounts for 76% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the autonomous prefecture.

    These local industries are gradually meeting the needs of the vast number of ethnic minority people. Some areas also produce a large number of building materials and industrial raw materials to support construction throughout the country. The Korean people of Yanbian are good at growing rice. Now, the local industry in the autonomous prefecture can supply farmers with plows, waterwheels, seeders, rice threshers, and other paddy field farm implements. The boots, shoes, yurt felts, and horse gear leather goods needed daily by the people of Inner Mongolia are now supplied by leather factories, fur factories, and some handicraft workshops, and no longer rely on outside areas. The autonomous region's emerging machinery industry also produces double-wheeled double-shared plows, milk separators, shearing machines, mowers and other production tools for farmers and herdsmen; food factories and milk processing plants purchase livestock and milk, which greatly increases the income of herdsmen. Xinjiang is rich in iron ore, but before liberation, even the iron for making hoes (a kind of agricultural tool) had to be transported from other places. Now, the Xinjiang Iron and Steel Plant can roll many kinds of steel to supply machine factories and manufacture agricultural tools for farmers of all ethnic groups. Some ethnic minorities living in the southwestern border areas of our country have used wooden plows and cattle horns to cultivate the land for thousands of years, but now they also have iron agricultural tools made by local iron factories. In some remote towns and villages, due to the establishment of power plants and grain processing plants, ethnic minority people have electric lights for the first time and eat machine-processed rice and flour.

    The unprecedented scale of exploration work further foreshadows the bright and splendid prospects for industrial development in ethnic minority areas. Since 1952, more than ninety geological exploration teams have conducted surveys in ethnic minority areas. Exploration team members have found huge iron ore deposits, overflowing underground oil seas, inexhaustible coal seams, and many kinds of non-ferrous metals and rare metals. Now, new industrial bases are beginning to be established like miracles on the desolate grasslands and in the vast Gobi Desert. In the Baotou area of Inner Mongolia, the exploration of large iron ore deposits has been completed, and more than a dozen new factories serving basic construction have also been put into production. A large iron and steel complex will be built there, including mining, metallurgy, and coking plants, with railway lines totaling hundreds of kilometers. In addition to the planned exploitation of non-ferrous metals and rare metals, Xinjiang has also discovered that Karamay in the Junggar Basin is currently China's most promising large oil area. An oil city has begun construction in the Gobi Desert, and large-scale drilling work is continuing to extend into the vast Gobi. In the Karamay-Urho exploration area of thousands of square kilometers, the towering drilling towers are constantly increasing, and now twenty-six exploratory wells have gushed crude oil. The Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province, inhabited by ethnic minorities, is an extremely rich treasure trove for our country. After two years of exploration, it has been confirmed that the basin contains large amounts of oil and many non-ferrous metals and coal and other mineral deposits. In this area, which used to be home to herds of wild horses, survey markers – red and white flags, tripods, and drilling towers – can now be seen everywhere. People are enthusiastically participating in the work of establishing new industrial bases. In the Tanggula Mountains, the Northern Tibetan Plateau, and the Yarlung Tsangpo River Basin in Tibet, exploration team members are also constantly discovering the endless treasures and water resources underground.

    With the development of industrial construction in ethnic minority areas, the working class of various ethnic minorities is also growing rapidly. Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang have trained tens of thousands of workers, technicians, and staff members of various ethnic groups. According to statistics from thirty-six factories in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, Zhuang, Miao, and Yao workers account for more than 18% of the total number of workers. Some enterprises in Yunnan have workers from more than a dozen ethnic groups, including Yi, Hui, Bai, Miao, and Hani. On the Kangzang Plateau, the number of Tibetan and Yi workers is also increasing. The Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, which had no industrial workers in the past, now has more than seven hundred industrial workers and construction workers.

    从无到有、从小到大，远景光辉灿烂
    各少数民族地区工业逐渐发展
    据新华社17日讯　全国各少数民族地区的工业建设，正在从无到有、从小到大地发展起来。
    内蒙古刚成立自治区的时候，只有不到六十个作坊，勉强能称为近代工业的只是几处设备破旧的小发电厂，和一所毛织厂。现在，近代化的工厂一个接一个地建立起来，除了森林工业，全自治区已有大小三百多座工厂。在新疆维吾尔自治区，天山南北已相继建立了钢铁、机器制造、纺织、皮毛等一百多个相当规模的工业企业。桂西僮族自治州今年就新建、扩建四十多个厂矿。在四川省当年红军长征经过的草地上，几座奶品加工厂、发电厂和煤矿也正在修建和准备修建。吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州的工业产值，占自治州工农业总产值的76％。
    这些地方工业正在逐步满足当地广大少数民族人民的需要，有的地区还生产了大量的建筑器材、工业原料，来支援祖国各地的建设。延边朝鲜族人民擅长种水稻，现在自治州的地方工业已能供应给农民犁杖、水车、播种机、打稻机和其它水田农具。内蒙古人民日常需用的靴鞋、蒙古包毡子和马具皮件，已由制革厂、皮毛厂和一些手工作坊来供应，而不再仰赖外区；自治区新兴的机械工业，还为农牧民们生产双轮双铧犁、牛奶分离器、剪毛机、割草机等生产用具；食品工厂和牛奶加工厂的收购食畜、牛奶，更使牧民们大大增加收入。新疆蕴藏着大量的铁矿，可是解放前连制造砍土镘（一种农具）的铁也要从外地运进，现在新疆钢铁厂已能轧制很多种钢材供应机器厂，为各族农民制造农具。居住在我国西南边疆的一些少数民族，千百年来一直使用木犁、牛角耕地，如今他们也开始有了当地铁工厂制造的铁质农具。在荒乡僻壤的一些集镇上，由于发电厂、粮食加工厂的建立，少数民族人民第一次有了电灯，吃到了机器加工的米面。
    空前规模的勘探工作，更预示着民族地区工业发展的光辉灿烂的远景。从1952年开始，先后有九十多个地质勘探队在少数民族地区进行勘查。勘探队员们在那里找到了巨大的铁矿，溢流地底的石油海，取之不尽的煤层，以及很多种有色金属和稀有金属。现在，在荒凉的草原上，在广漠的戈壁滩，像出现奇迹似地开始建立新的工业基地。在内蒙古的包头地区，已经完成了大铁矿的勘探工作，为基本建设服务的十几座新工厂也已投入生产。那里将要建设一个庞大的钢铁联合企业，包括采矿、冶金、焦化等工厂，所拥有的铁路线就有几百公里长。新疆除了对有色金属和稀有金属进行了有计划的开采以外，还探明准噶尔盆地的克拉玛依是我国目前最有希望的大石油区。一座石油城已经在戈壁上开始建设，大规模的钻探工作正继续向辽阔的戈壁上伸延。在克拉玛依——乌尔禾的几千平方公里的探区，高耸的钻塔不断增多，现在已有二十六口探井喷出了原油。少数民族居住的青海省柴达木盆地，更是我国极其丰富的聚宝盆。经过两年的勘查，证实了盆地蕴藏着大量的石油和许多有色金属和煤等矿藏。在这片过去野马成群的地方，现在到处可以看到勘测的标记——红白旗、三角架和钻塔。人们火热地参加了建立新工业基地的工作。在西藏的唐古拉山、藏北草原和雅鲁藏布江流域，勘探队员们也正在不断发现地下的无尽宝藏和水力资源。
    随着民族地区工业建设的发展，各少数民族自己的工人阶级也正在迅速地成长。内蒙古、新疆已培养出几万名各族工人、技术人员和职员。桂西僮族自治州据三十六个工厂的统计，僮、苗、瑶族工人已占工人总数18％以上。云南的一些企业，有着包括彝、回、白、苗、哈尼等十几种民族的工人。在康藏高原上，藏、彝族工人也日益增多。四川省的甘孜藏族自治州过去没有一个产业工人，现在已有产业工人、建筑工人等七百多人。
