    The Experience of Wuhan No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Mill in Implementing Collective Leadership
    Perfect Party Unity, Truly Consistent Thought

    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the Wuhan No. 1 State-Owned Cotton Mill implemented the system of division of responsibility under the unified leadership of the Party Committee in the fourth quarter of 1953, it has comprehensively fulfilled the state plan every year and has now reached the total output value level of next year one year and three months ahead of schedule. The secretary of the factory's Party committee said: The most important reason they have been able to consistently adhere to the Party's collective leadership and fulfill the state plan is that they constantly pay attention to maintaining Party unity.

    The unity within the Party in this factory was achieved through a difficult struggle. Before August 1953, although they claimed to be implementing the Party Committee system, the main members of the Party Committee looked down on each other, were not convinced by each other, and Party Committee meetings lacked prior deliberation and often resulted in arguments, making it impossible to reach resolutions. Collective leadership existed only in name, and production in the factory was very poor. Production plans often had to be completed by workers working overtime, and there were even major liability accidents. After September 1953, with the help of the higher-level Party Committee, the factory's Party Committee held more than ten consecutive days of meetings. Through criticism and self-criticism, they examined the harm that disunity within the Party had caused to the work. At the same time, corresponding adjustments were made to certain cadres, fundamentally changing the situation of disunity among the leaders of the Party Committee, and the system of division of responsibility under the collective leadership of the Party Committee began to be established. In the fourth quarter of that year, the factory successfully completed its production plan.

    Since then, in order to ensure consistency in thought and action among the members of the Party Committee, before each Party Committee meeting, the main leaders of the factory would always conduct necessary deliberations on the issues to be discussed. If there were differences of opinion at the meeting that could not be resolved immediately, they would not rigidly adopt the method of majority vote, but rather emphasize repeated deliberation and consultation after the meeting, studying the documents of higher authorities more, and investigating the actual situation more, in order to achieve true ideological consistency. Many facts in this factory have proven that this approach not only maintained Party unity, but also made the leadership of the Party Committee more practical. For example, when the Party Committee was making its annual overall plan this year, some Party Committee members believed that the output of cotton yarn could be increased by 1,000 pieces this year by increasing the speed of the machines. However, the factory director was afraid that this would affect the quality of the cotton yarn and disagreed with this opinion. These two opinions could not be reconciled after prior deliberation and repeated discussions at the Party Committee meeting. After the meeting, the Party Secretary and the Factory Director, who held different views, decided to go deep into reality together to seek the truth through individual conversations. Finally, after several tests in the workshop, it was proven that increasing the production of 1,000 pieces of cotton yarn would not reduce the quality of the products, and the two sides reached a consensus. The actual production results have also proven that the Party Committee's decision at that time was correct.

    After the factory adopted the above-mentioned methods, it ensured constant ideological consistency among the members of the Party Committee. However, it did not mean that there were no differences of opinion, mutual estrangement, and misunderstandings among the members of the Party Committee at any time or on any issue. In order to resolve these potential differences, estrangements, and misunderstandings in a timely manner, the members of the factory's Party Committee have insisted on exchanging ideas and conducting criticism and self-criticism at group meetings once a month since this year, eliminating some phenomena of insufficient unity among the members of the Party Committee. For example, in June of this year, the factory director accepted the opinions of relevant departments requesting a change in the spinning of cotton yarn without the consent of the Party Committee. From July, the quality of the factory's cotton yarn decreased, and the quality plan was not completed. The members of the Party Committee had mutual complaints. Some Party Committee members believed that the factory director should not have changed the spinning of cotton yarn without authorization. The factory director believed that some Party Committee members did not provide enough support for the work of changing the spinning of cotton yarn. Later, at the Party's group meeting, they mutually examined their own thoughts and eliminated the estrangement between the two sides. Afterwards, everyone worked together to solve the difficulties brought about by the change in the spinning of cotton yarn. From September, the factory once again comprehensively completed the state plan.

    武汉国棉一厂实行集体领导制的经验
    党内团结无间　思想真正一致
    本报讯　国营武汉第一棉纺织厂自1953年第四季度起坚持党委统一领导下的分工负责制以来，年年全面完成国家计划，现在已经提前一年零三个月达到了明年的总产值水平。这个厂的党委书记说：他们能够始终坚持党的集体领导，完成国家计划，最重要的是在于时刻注意了维护党的团结。
    这个厂党内的团结是经过一番艰巨的斗争才取得的。1953年8月以前，他们虽说也是实行党委制，但是因为那时党委会的主要成员间互相轻视，互不服气，党委会议事先既缺少酝酿，会上又往往争吵一场，作不出决议。集体领导名存实亡，厂内生产也就很不景气，生产计划常常要靠工人加班加点才能勉强完成，还发生过重大的责任事故。1953年9月以后，在上级党委的帮助下，这个厂的党委会连续举行了十多天的会议，通过批评和自我批评，检查了党内不团结对于工作的危害；同时，相应地调整了某些干部，使党委会的领导人员间互不团结的局面有了根本的转变，党委集体领导下的分工负责制也开始建立起来。就在这一年的第四季度，这个厂顺利地完成了生产计划。
    在此以后，为了保证党委会成员间的思想和步调一致，这个厂的党委会每次开党委会议前，主要领导人员都一定把要讨论的问题事先在相互间作一番必要的酝酿；会上如有分歧的意见，一时不能解决，也不生硬地采取多数通过的办法，而是强调采用会后反复酝酿、商量，多学习上级文件，多调查实际情况的办法，以求思想上的真正一致。这个厂有很多事实证明这样做不但维护了党的团结，也使党委会的领导更切合实际。例如今年党委会作年度全面规划时，一部分党委委员认为可以用加快机器转速等办法使今年的棉纱产量增加一千件。但是厂长怕因此影响棉纱的质量，不同意这种意见。这两种意见经过事先的酝酿和党委会议上的反复讨论还是不能一致。会后，存在着不同见解的党委书记和厂长经过个别交谈，便决定要共同深入实际去求真理。最后，经过在车间里的几次试验，证明了增产一千件棉纱并不会使产品质量下降，双方意见才取得了一致。而现在实际生产的结果，也证明了党委会当时的决定是正确的。
    这个厂采取上述办法以后，保证了党委会成员间经常的思想一致，但也并不是在任何时候、任何问题上党委委员间都不发生意见分歧、互相隔阂和误会的。为了使这些可能产生的分歧、隔阂和误会能及时解决，这个厂的党委会委员们从今年起坚持了每月在小组会上交流一次思想情况，开展批评和自我批评，消除了一些党委委员间不够团结的现象。例如今年6月份，厂长没有经过党委会的同意接受了有关部门要求改纺棉纱的意见。7月份起，这个厂的棉纱质量降低了，没有完成质量计划，党委会成员间互有埋怨情绪，一部分党委委员认为厂长不应该擅自改纺棉纱。厂长认为一些党委委员对改纺棉纱的工作支持不够。后来，在党的小组会上，他们互相检查了自己的思想，消除了双方的隔阂。以后大家协力解决改纺棉纱后带来的困难。9月份起，这个厂又全面完成了国家计划。
