Jiangxi Province is actively developing hog production. The Nanchang Special District currently has over 730,000 hogs, an increase of over 230,000 compared to the same period last year, a production increase of 29%; the twelve counties in the Gan-nan Administrative District had raised over 315,000 hogs by November 15th, an increase of over 45,000 from last month, a production increase of 17%.

In developing hog production, all areas are paying particular attention to developing sow production. In Pingxiang County, Nanchang Special District alone, there are over 20,000 sows; in the Xiazhen District of Yushan County, Shangrao Special District, there is an average of one sow for every two and a half households. Due to the increase in sows, the number of piglets has also increased. Yushan County alone estimates that it will breed over 130,000 piglets by the end of this year, exceeding the county's highest piglet breeding output in 1952 by over 70%. Many counties in the Gan-nan Administrative District are encouraging farmers to increase the raising of sows and boars, and are calling for the elimination of empty pregnancies, estimating that 70% to 80% of the sows in the region can give birth to a litter before the Spring Festival.

　　江西生猪正在增加
    本报讯　江西省各地积极发展生猪生产。南昌专区现有生猪七十三万多头，比去年同时期增养二十三万多头，增产29％；赣南行政区十二个县到11月15日止，已养猪三十一万五千多头，比上个月增养四万五千多头，增产17％。
    在发展生猪生产中，各地特别注意发展母猪的生产。南昌专区的萍乡县一个县，就养有母猪两万多头；上饶专区的玉山县下镇区，平均每两户半就有一头母猪。由于母猪的增多，小猪也随之增多了。玉山县一个县，估计到今年年底就可繁殖小猪十三万多头，超过该县小猪繁殖量最高的1952年产量的70％多。赣南行政区的许多县，鼓励农民增养母猪和公猪，并号召消灭空怀现象，估计全区有70％到80％的母猪在春节以前，可生一次小猪。
