	Save the Pregnant Cows

	Since the beginning of autumn, many of the cows slaughtered by the Tianjin Food Company have been pregnant. From September 20th to October 23rd, in those thirty-three days, the Xiaoxiguan Cattle and Sheep Processing Plant alone slaughtered 3,855 cows, of which 2,045 were pregnant. Judging by the gestation period, some were only one or two months along, while others already had a full coat of hair. On October 20th, the day with the highest pregnancy slaughter rate, 58 out of 69 cows slaughtered were pregnant. The slaughterhouse workers are very unhappy about this.

	What is the reason for this? The Tianjin Food Company also has an explanation. They say that the China Food Company issued "Measures for Slaughtering Livestock with Tilling Labor and Breeding Capacity" in March of this year, stipulating that inspection conditions at the sales destination should be subordinate to the place of origin. Therefore, they slaughter any cow with a "Slaughter Permit" from the place of origin, without caring about the protection of young livestock.

	Having said that, after the China Food Company made such regulations, should they not consider the consequences it would cause? Of course, what conditions are the place of origin (Inner Mongolia) using to issue "Slaughter Permits"? These are all issues that should be studied.

### 救救怀胎的牛

    救救怀胎的牛
    入秋以来，天津市食品公司屠宰的牛当中很多是怀胎的。9月20日到10月23日这三十三天中，仅小西关牛羊加工厂一地宰杀的三千八百五十五头牛当中，就有二千零四十五头是怀胎的。从怀胎的时间看，小的有一两个月，大的已长全了毛。屠宰怀胎率最高的一天——10月20日，宰杀的六十九头牛中，竟有五十八头是怀胎的。屠宰工人都很有意见。
    这是什么道理？天津市食品公司也有个说词。他们说，中国食品公司在今年三月里发出的“有耕作劳动及繁育能力的牲畜屠宰办法”中规定：检验条件销地应服从产地。于是他们只要见有产地的“准屠证”就屠宰，并不关心对幼畜的保护。
    话又说回来了，中国食品公司作出这样的规定以后，还要不要考虑它引起的后果？当然，产地（内蒙古）究竟根据什么条件发给“准屠证”？这都是应该研究的问题。
