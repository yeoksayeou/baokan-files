    National Passenger Trains Begin Implementing Winter Schedule
    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of Railways has decided to implement the winter passenger train schedule starting December 1st of this year.

    This winter schedule is adjusted based on the summer schedule, according to the increase in passenger flow. To meet the needs of increased passenger volume, a total of sixty-five pairs of passenger trains have been added nationwide. For example, one pair of Beijing-Changchun through slow trains has been added, one pair of Beijing-Zhengzhou through passenger trains has been added on the Jinghan Line, and a short-distance express train between Changchun and Jilin has also been added. In addition, to reduce the inconvenience of transfers for passengers, the original Tianjin-Shenyang trains 67-68 have been extended to Dalian, and Tianjin-Shanhaiguan trains 123-124 have been extended to Shenyang. At the same time, considering the large number of express trains and high passenger flow on the Jinpu Line, which makes it difficult for short-distance passengers to board, a through slow train between Jinan and Pukou has been specially added. To alleviate the tension of the saturated throughput capacity on the West Longhai Line, a pair of spare train operation lines has also been determined in the winter schedule, which can be used to add temporary passenger trains at any time according to the increase in passenger flow.

    In railway hub areas, many suburban passenger trains have also been added, and the arrival and departure times of suburban passenger trains have been improved to better suit the needs of workers commuting to work and students going to school.

    全国旅客列车开始实行冬季运行图
    本报讯　铁道部已决定从今年12月1日起开始实行冬季旅客列车运行图。
    今年冬季运行图是在夏季运行图的基础上，根据客流增加的情况进行调整的。根据客运量增长的需要，全国共增加了六十五对旅客列车，如增开了北京—长春直通慢车一对，京汉线增加了北京—郑州直通客车一对，还增开了长春—吉林的短途快车。此外，为减少旅客换乘麻烦将原来天津—沈阳67—68列车延长至大连，天津—山海关123—124次列车延长至沈阳；同时考虑到津浦线快车多，客流大，短途旅客乘车困难，特别加开了济南—浦口直通慢车。为了缓和西陇海线通过能力饱和的紧张状况，在冬季运行图中还确定了一对旅客列车备用运行线，可根据客流增长情况随时加开临时旅客列车。
    在铁路枢纽地区还增开了不少市郊旅客列车，并改善了市郊旅客列车的到开时刻，使它更适合职工上下班和学生上学的需要。
