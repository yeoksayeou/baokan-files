Xinhua News Agency, December 1st, London Dispatch: French Foreign Minister Pineau attended the talks held in London on November 30th between Britain and Turkey, plotting a conspiracy against Syria.

According to a United Press report, Turkish Acting Foreign Minister Menderes told Lloyd that an Iraqi invasion of Syria might become unavoidable, and in that case, Turkey would definitely help Iraq. United Press also reported that Menderes would also seek assurances of British support.

At the same time, some British bourgeois newspapers are conducting slanderous propaganda against Syria. They claim that the number of Soviet weapons in Syria is constantly increasing, and openly call for rising up against Syria "before it's too late."

These newspapers are also discussing the close cooperation between Britain and the United States in planning an action plan to invade Syria. They estimate that Baghdad Pact member states - Turkey and Iraq - may be chosen as tools for this new provocation.

A political commentator for the "Daily Express" revealed that the recent meeting of the four member states of the Baghdad Pact (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan) discussed the issue of intervention in Syria in detail. The "Times" diplomatic commentator believes that Britain, France, the United States, and the aforementioned Baghdad Pact member states should all participate in the invasion of Syria. This commentator confirmed that the French and Turks had already held negotiations in Paris on this issue.

　  英法土三国外长曾在伦敦会谈
　　策划侵略叙利亚的阴谋
    新华社1日讯　伦敦消息：法国外交部长比诺11月30日参加了英国和土耳其在伦敦举行的策划反叙利亚阴谋的会谈。
    据合众社消息，土耳其代理外交部长曼德列斯对劳埃德说：伊拉克入侵叙利亚可能成为不可避免，在那种情况下，土耳其一定会帮助伊拉克。合众社还报道说，曼德列斯还将谋求英国提供支持的保证。
    在这同时，英国一些资产阶级报纸正在对叙利亚进行诬蔑宣传。它们说什么叙利亚境内的苏联武器在不断增加，并且公开号召“在还不算迟”的时候起来反对叙利亚。
    这些报刊还在议论英美两国紧密合作筹划侵略叙利亚的行动计划。据它们估计，巴格达条约成员国——土耳其和伊拉克可能被选做这次新挑衅的工具。
      “每日快报”的政治评论员透露，最近举行的巴格达条约四个成员国（土耳其、伊朗、伊拉克和巴基斯坦）的会议，详尽地讨论了干涉叙利亚的问题。“泰晤士报”外交评论员认为，英国、法国、美国、以及上述的巴格达条约成员国都应当参加侵略叙利亚的行动。这位评论家证实法国人和土耳其人已经就这个问题在巴黎举行过谈判。
