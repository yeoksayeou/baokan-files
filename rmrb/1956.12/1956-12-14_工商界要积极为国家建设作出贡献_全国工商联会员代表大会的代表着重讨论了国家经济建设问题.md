Xinhua News Agency, December 13th. The representatives to the Second Member Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce today focused their discussions on national economic construction and how industrialists and businessmen can further play an active role in the future.

    During the discussion of Vice Premier Bo Yibo's report, many representatives believed that the achievements of the First Five-Year Plan were great. They particularly felt that the government's frank discussion of existing problems in various works with the industrial and commercial circles was a sign of the country's emphasis on and trust in them.

    Representatives from Shanghai and Jiangsu, where light industry and textile industry are relatively developed, believe that under the state's requirement to actively develop light industry during the Second Five-Year Plan, their responsibilities are even greater. Many people pointed out that the production and operation management of joint state-private enterprises are still lagging behind state-owned enterprises, and must be seriously improved in the future. Some representatives from Jiangsu Province believe that the textile industry requires less investment and yields greater benefits. They suggested that the government should fully utilize the industrial base along the coast to appropriately expand production to meet the growing needs of the people.

    In the discussion, the representatives, combined with Chen Shutong's report, talked about the Party and the government's emphasis and care for the industrial and commercial circles. The industrial and commercial circles should strive to strengthen their studies, take the initiative to improve the public-private partnership, participate in socialist competition, to play an active role and contribute to national construction. Representatives Dong Shaochen and Huang Zhaogui from Tianjin, as well as representatives from Shaanxi, Gansu, Hubei, Sichuan and other provinces, put forward some good opinions and specific guarantees on how to play an active role in the future. Representative Dong Shaochen said that private personnel used to be careful in running enterprises, starting from personal interests. Today, the future of the country and personal destiny are combined. We must manage enterprises as if we are managing our own lives and cultivate new feelings and new styles of responsibility to the country. Some representatives from Sichuan Province proposed that not only should personal lives be thrifty and simple in the future, but also enterprises should be run diligently and thriftily. Many representatives from Hubei, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan proposed that the fixed interest they receive should not be squandered and wasted except for subsidizing their families, but should be used for national construction and social undertakings through methods such as buying public bonds.

    Some representatives from Jilin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Tianjin and other places carried forward the spirit of self-criticism and examined that they had not fully played an active role in the past due to concerns and other negative factors. Some representatives said that after the joint state-private ownership, they were timid and afraid to take responsibility. Some representatives said that when they saw that the public representatives did not understand technology, they became proud and complacent and did not respect the public representatives, but one-sidedly demanded that the public representatives respect themselves. Representatives from Liaoning Province believe that the reason for this situation is that the patriotic ideology of industrialists and businessmen has not been well established, and they often proceed from personal interests when dealing with problems.

    In the group discussion, some public representatives of joint state-private enterprises in Sichuan Province also examined that their working attitude was relatively rigid in handling public-private partnership in the past and they did not well understand the policies of the Party and the country, and expressed that they would improve it well in the future.

### 工商界要积极为国家建设作出贡献  全国工商联会员代表大会的代表着重讨论了国家经济建设问题

    工商界要积极为国家建设作出贡献
    全国工商联会员代表大会的代表着重讨论了国家经济建设问题
    新华社13日讯　全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会的代表，今天着重讨论了国家经济建设和工商业者今后如何进一步发挥积极作用问题。
    在讨论薄一波副总理的报告时，很多代表认为第一个五年计划的成就是伟大的，特别对于政府能把许多工作中存在的问题坦率地向工商界谈，感到这是国家对他们重视和信任的表现。
    轻工业和纺织工业比较发达的上海市和江苏省的一些代表，认为在国家在第二个五年计划期间要积极发展轻工业的要求下，他们的责任更加重大了。不少人提出目前公私合营企业的生产和经营管理还落后于国营企业，今后必须认真改进。江苏省有些代表认为纺织工业投资少，收效大，建议政府充分利用沿海工业的基础，适当扩大生产，以适应人民日益增长的需要。
    在讨论中，代表们都结合陈叔通的报告谈到了党和政府对工商界这样重视和关怀，工商界应该努力加强学习，主动搞好公私共事关系，参加社会主义竞赛，以发挥积极作用，为国家建设作出贡献。天津市代表董少臣、黄兆贵和陕西、甘肃、湖北、四川等省的代表，对今后如何发挥积极作用提出了一些好的意见和具体保证。董少臣代表说，私方人员过去办企业精打细算，出发点是为了个人。今天国家前途和个人命运结合在一起了，我们要像自己过日子一样地管理企业，培养对国家负责的新感情、新作风。四川省有些代表提出，今后不仅个人的生活要勤俭朴素，而且要勤俭办企业。湖北、陕西、甘肃、四川不少代表都提出，得到的定息除了补贴家用外，不要挥霍浪费，要通过买公债等办法，用于国家建设和社会事业上。
    吉林、辽宁、黑龙江、山东、天津等地的一些代表，发扬了自我批评的精神，检查了自己过去因为存在着顾虑和其他消极因素，还没有充分发挥积极作用。有的代表说，在公私合营后，小手小脚，不敢负责；有的代表说，看到公方代表不懂技术，自己就骄傲自满，不大尊重公方代表，反而片面地要求公方代表尊重自己。辽宁省代表认为产生这种情况的原因，是工商业者爱国主义思想还没有很好确立起来，处理问题时常常是从个人利益出发。
    在小组讨论中，四川省有些公私合营企业的公方代表也检查了自己过去在处理公私共事关系中工作态度比较生硬，没有很好地体会党和国家的政策，表示今后要很好地改进。
