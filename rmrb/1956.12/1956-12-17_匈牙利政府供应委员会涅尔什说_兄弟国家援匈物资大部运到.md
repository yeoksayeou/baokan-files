Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 16th: Of the total of $48 million in aid materials given to the Hungarian people by various socialist countries, approximately $30 million worth of materials have arrived in Hungary so far, and the remaining materials are either en route or awaiting shipment. This was stated by Rezső Nyers, the Hungarian Government Supply Commissioner, when answering questions from Xinhua reporters regarding the fraternal assistance provided to the Hungarian people by various socialist countries.

Nyers said that in addition to this gratuitous aid, the Hungarian government is negotiating loan issues with many fraternal countries. Although the total amount of the loan has not yet been determined, it is estimated to be three to four times the value of the aforementioned aid materials.

The materials transported from fraternal countries are mainly daily necessities and building materials, which are urgently needed by the Hungarian people at present. Among these fraternal countries that have provided aid materials, the Soviet Union has provided the most.

Nyers said that the 30 million rubles of aid from China to Hungary has been fully allocated to Hungary in foreign exchange. Hungary can use this money in the international market to pay for and purchase urgently needed materials.

Nyers said that Western countries have also verbally stated that they will assist Hungary, but it is just empty talk.

Finally, when talking about the current economic situation, Nyers pointed out that there is no inflation phenomenon yet, but the economic situation is very difficult. Coal production is only one-eighth of what it was. If factories cannot return to normal production by January, inflation may occur.

Rezső Nyers said that the materials transported from fraternal countries have greatly helped Hungary in its difficulties. The Hungarian government and people express their heartfelt gratitude for the selfless assistance provided by fraternal countries.

    匈牙利政府供应委员会涅尔什说
    兄弟国家援匈物资大部运到
    据新华社布达佩斯16日电　在各社会主义国家给予匈牙利人民的总数达四千八百万美元的无偿援助物资中，到现在为止，已经有价值约值三千万美元的物资运到了匈牙利，其余的物资也正在运送途中或正待装运。这是匈牙利政府供应委员会雷热·涅尔什在回答有关各社会主义国家给予匈牙利人民的兄弟援助情况时告诉新华社记者的。
    涅尔什说，除了这些无偿援助外，匈牙利政府正在和许多兄弟国家接洽贷款问题。贷款的总数虽然还没有确定，但是估计将在上述援助物资价值的三到四倍之间。
    从兄弟国家运到的物资，主要是各种人民生活必需品和建筑材料，这些物资正是当前匈牙利人民所迫切需要的。在这些运来援助物资的兄弟国家中，苏联运来的最多。
    涅尔什说，中国援助匈牙利的三千万卢布，已经全部用外汇拨付给匈牙利。匈牙利可以用这笔钱在国际市场上支付和购买迫切需要的物资。
    涅尔什说，西方国家也曾经口头上说要援助匈牙利，但是只是一句空话。
    涅尔什最后在谈到当前的经济情况的时候指出，现在还没有通货膨胀的现象，但是经济情况是非常困难的。现在煤的生产仅有八分之一。如果到1月份工厂还不能正常生产的话，将可能发生通货膨胀。
    雷热·涅尔什说，兄弟国家运来的物资大大地帮助了在困难中的匈牙利。对于兄弟国家所给予的无私援助，匈牙利政府和人民表示衷心的感谢。
