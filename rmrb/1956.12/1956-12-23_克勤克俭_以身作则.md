    Thrift and Diligence, Leading by Example
    Jing Yu
    Among the leading personnel of factories and mines, there is no lack of people who consistently run enterprises with diligence and frugality. The deeds of such people are often praised and spread by the masses. Today, the "Factory Director Yang Runs Enterprise Thriftily" published in this newspaper is one such example.
    The deeds of Factory Director Yang have the following outstanding points:
    First, it is the attitude of careful calculation and prudent spending. People spend money almost every day in managing their households and enterprises, and it seems that spending money is not a difficult task. However, it is not an easy task to spend less money and get more done, spend every penny in the most urgent place, and save unnecessary expenses as much as possible. When preparing budgets and approving expenditures, enterprise leaders should follow the mass line and make careful calculations like Factory Director Yang of Ningbo Iron Factory. First, consult with the masses to understand whether the money should be spent, and if it should be spent, whether it can be spent as little as possible. When deciding to spend the money, help the subordinates to study specific methods of spending less money and getting more done. Resolutely do not spend money that should not be spent. This approach can not only ensure saving expenses and avoiding waste, but also solve problems and satisfy the masses. Some enterprise leaders subjectively want to do things well, but because they are accustomed to making decisions and approvals individually without consulting the masses, they waste money and arouse dissatisfaction among the masses. It can be seen that it is also necessary to follow the mass line on the issue of spending money.
    Second, be fair in public and private matters, and prevent special privileges. In the daily work and life of enterprise leaders, many things are often intertwined between public and private matters. For example, the allocation of dormitories, the purchase of transportation for institutions, the addition of office equipment, the use of cultural and entertainment supplies, etc., carelessness can lead to the phenomenon of mixing public and private matters and being out of touch with the masses. Therefore, how people in charge of money and materials in enterprise institutions can prevent special privileges and be fair in public and private matters like Ningbo Iron Factory is a very important matter. Factory Director Yang of Ningbo Iron Factory said it well: "The plan is completed by everyone. What right do our leading cadres have to enjoy the fruits alone?" Unfortunately, some enterprise leaders still do not pay attention to this point! They take the opportunity to arrange things for themselves first, and even engage in corruption under the guise of public service. This style of work violates the spirit of hard work.
    Third, always care about the hardships of the masses. Whether enterprise leaders care about the hardships of the masses often affects the production mood of employees. Therefore, constantly caring about the difficulties and demands of the masses, helping employees with difficulties to solve their difficulties in a timely manner, and actively educating employees to correctly understand the correct relationship between the improvement of life and the increase in production are the regular work of enterprise leaders. Many enterprise leaders pay attention to the cooling and heatstroke prevention of employees in summer, pay attention to the heating and cold protection of employees in winter, and usually pay attention to the living and welfare facilities of employees. This style of work has left a good impression on the masses.
    In short, the leadership personnel of the enterprise set an example, are diligent and thrifty, and have a great influence on the enterprise. To establish this style of diligence, thrift, simplicity, and care for the masses, we must first have a high degree of mass viewpoint and a spirit of responsibility for the people's cause. Only under this spirit can we achieve diligence and thrift in running enterprises.

    克勤克俭　以身作则
    井予
    在厂矿企业领导人员中，一贯勤俭朴素办企业的实在不乏其人。这种人的事迹常常为群众所称颂传播着。今天本报刊登的“勤俭办企业的杨厂长”就是这样的一个例子。
    杨厂长的事迹，有以下几点是比较突出的。
    第一、就是精打细算、慎重花钱的态度。人们治理家务、管理企业差不多每天都要花钱，似乎花钱并不是什么难事。不过，要做到少花钱、多办事，把每一分钱都花在最急要的地方，并且尽可能地节省不必要的开支，并不是一件容易的事情。企业领导人员在编制预算和批核开支的时候，应当像宁波铁工厂的杨厂长那样走群众路线、精打细算。首先和群众商量，了解该不该花，该花的能不能尽量少花。在决定花这笔钱的时候，又帮助下面研究少花钱、多办事的具体办法。对于不该花的钱就坚决不花。这种做法，既可以保证节省开支、避免浪费；又做到解决问题，群众满意。有些企业领导人员，主观上很想把事情办好，只因为他们习惯于个人决定和批示，不同群众商量，结果，浪费了钱财，还引起了群众不满。可见，在花钱问题上走群众路线，也是必要的。
    第二、公私分明，防止特殊。在企业领导人员日常工作和生活里，有许多事情，公事和私事常常交错在一起，比如说，宿舍的分配，机关交通工具的购置，办公设备的添置，文化娱乐用品的使用等等，稍不注意，就会发生公私混杂、脱离群众的现象。因此，企业机关里掌握钱财物资的人，如何做到像宁波铁工厂那样防止特殊，公私分明，是一件十分重要的事情。宁波铁工厂的杨厂长说得好：“计划是靠大家完成的，我们领导干部有什么权利可以单独享受成果呢？”可惜，有些企业的领导人员偏偏在这一点上还不注意！他们一有机会，首先为自己安排，甚至假公济私。这种作风是违反艰苦奋斗精神的。
    第三、时刻关心群众的疾苦。企业领导者能否关心群众的疾苦，常常会影响职工的生产情绪。所以，时刻关怀群众的困难和要求，及时帮助有困难的职工解决困难，积极教育职工正确认识生活的改善和生产提高的正确关系，这是企业领导人员的经常工作。很多企业的领导人员在夏季注意到职工的降温防暑，在冬季注意到职工的取暖防寒，平时，经常注意到职工生活福利设施。这种作风在群众中留下了良好的印象。
    总之，企业的领导人员以身作则，克勤克俭，给企业的影响很大。要树立这种勤俭朴素、关怀群众的作风，首先要具有高度的群众观点和对人民事业负责的精神。只有在这种精神下，才能做到克勤克俭办企业。
