　　Friendship
　　Cao Baoming, Gong Qiang
　　When the caisson drilling of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge was completed, and the drillers were busy packing up their equipment to build a new bridge over the Min River, Qiu Zhenxiang began a fierce ideological struggle: Should he return to Anshan, or should he go with the others to build a new bridge using the "caisson drilling method"? ... He struggled for a long time, and finally made up his mind: to go to the Min River.
　　There were many reasons why he was attracted to the Min River, one of which was his friendship with Soviet expert Koskin.
　　When it was initially decided to use the "caisson drilling method" – the world's latest technology – to build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, there was not a single driller in the Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau. Qiu Zhenxiang was sent from the Anshan Iron Mine to meet this need.
　　As soon as he arrived, the Soviet experts asked him to discuss the work, and decided to open a training class to train new drillers, with him as the instructor. As soon as he heard this, he became anxious: "I have only been to school for two months. Even if you add up the time I spent attending various training classes after liberation, it's still less than two years of schooling. How can I give lectures?"
　　The head of the expert group, Silin, pointed to a stout Soviet expert with a slightly protruding belly and said, "You teach! If you encounter difficulties, expert Koskin will help you." Koskin then added, "Teaching others is also a good opportunity for yourself to learn."
　　Old Qiu encountered the difficulty of not having teaching materials at the beginning of his teaching. Koskin compiled a set of lectures for him. There were many technical translation terms in the lectures that he didn't understand, so he studied them with the specific help of expert Koskin and two other drillers for a few days before he could understand them.
　　The initial contact with expert Koskin left a deep impression on Old Qiu. Originally, he always believed that as long as you have operational experience, you don't need to look up to technical theory and technical personnel, and you are not willing to ask others for advice when something happens. However, in the face of this new job, he deeply felt that theory was essential, especially when he saw an expert like Koskin, who was very rich in both theory and experience, and still often consulted a Chinese worker to discuss problems and adopt his opinions. He began to change his attitude and actively consulted expert Koskin and Chinese engineers when he had problems. Koskin also gave him some drilling drawings and asked him to study them to improve his theoretical level.
　　The biggest difficulty Qiu Zhenxiang encountered in his work was that he was only familiar with drilling rocks in mines and lacked experience in drilling rocks on water. Once, Koskin asked him, "How do you prevent quicksand in the caisson?"
　　"Use clay and rubble to block it," Old Qiu said.
　　"What if it can't be blocked?"
　　"Then I'll go down into the hole to see." Old Qiu replied without thinking.
　　In the mine, he could go down into large drill holes to check the situation and find the reason.
　　But Koskin said to him, "There are thirty or forty meters of water in the caisson, you can't go down, and you can't pump it dry."
　　This question stumped Old Qiu and his partners. When they returned to the dormitory and talked about this problem again, they all just drank tea and couldn't say anything.
　　Sure enough, as soon as the drilling machine was moved to the water, it encountered a serious quicksand problem. Before the drilling machine had been started for long, six meters of quicksand had poured into the caisson, making it impossible for the drilling machine to drive the drill bit. They used a mud suction machine to suck out the quicksand and then drilled again, but after only drilling for a few tens of minutes, the quicksand poured into the caisson again, still six meters thick. The drilling work made no progress at all. This made Old Qiu, who was impatient, very anxious. He had a cigarette in his hand, running up to Turtle Mountain to observe the slope of the terrain, feeling that such terrain should not have so much quicksand pouring in; then rushing to the pier platform to look down at the situation in the caisson, only seeing a dark hole, the river was very deep, and he couldn't see anything. Unexpectedly, just as he was thinking about this problem, his cigarette butt ignited the gas tank next to him, and with a bang, his eyes were burned.
　　Old Qiu was hospitalized the first night, and expert Koskin came to see him with apples and snacks the next day at noon. He was both excited and sad at the time. He didn't expect expert Koskin to come to the hospital to see him so quickly. At the same time, he felt that he, an old worker, was so careless and caused an accident, which was really wrong. With gauze covering his eyes, he heard the heavy footsteps of expert Koskin and struggled to sit up, only feeling Koskin's two big hands supporting him and pressing him to continue to rest.
　　"How do you feel?" Koskin asked two questions in a row.
　　"What's the problem on the construction site?" Old Qiu asked anxiously.
　　"Our work is very good, all the problems have been solved."
　　"How did you solve it?" Old Qiu became excited and asked.
　　"Your task now is to recuperate, don't worry about the construction site."
　　Expert Koskin's consolation made Old Qiu feel a kind of comradely care and warmth, and also aroused the surprise of the people in the hospital. He heard the doctors and nurses discussing in low voices for a while, and then a girl came up to him and asked, "Are you an engineer?"
　　"No, I'm a worker."
　　"Then what work do you lead?"
　　"Workers just work!"
　　"Then why did the Soviet expert come to see you? ... Are you and the Soviet expert very good?"
　　During Old Qiu's hospitalization, the new drillers sent a representative every day to inquire about "Teacher Qiu's" injuries, and he continued to ask them about the situation on the construction site. Some clever young people would pick the good things to tell him: "The expert found out that the original quicksand problem was caused by the caisson being two centimeters short of reaching the riverbed rock layer, so the sand outside kept pouring in. Now, after the caisson reached the rock layer, the expert used the method of throwing clay and rubble to solve the problem." Some less-minded young people would honestly tell him: "The quicksand problem has been solved, but there is a problem with the clutch overheating. The drilling machine runs for ten minutes, and the clutch gets hot and smokes, so it has to stop. Working and stopping like this, twenty-four hours a day, is not enough for three hours of work." When Old Qiu heard this, he became anxious again. Not long after the gauze on his eyes was removed, he insisted on being discharged from the hospital.
　　As soon as he was discharged from the hospital, he threw his things into the dormitory and rushed to the water construction site. As soon as he went down the stone steps, Koskin saw him on Pier No. 1, waved to him with both hands, and greeted him: "Are you better?" Koskin took a closer look and saw that his complexion had not recovered, so he asked:
　　"Who told you to be discharged from the hospital?"
　　"I wanted to be discharged from the hospital myself."
　　"Why did you want to be discharged from the hospital? Your complexion is still very bad."
　　Old Qiu felt like a naughty primary school student at the time and couldn't answer. Koskin then said: "If the injury recurs and you are hospitalized a second time, it will be troublesome. What did the doctor say?"
　　"The doctor said that the eyes will not go blind, at most they will be nearsighted."
　　Seeing Old Qiu's expression, Koskin didn't want to say much, so he changed his tone and said: "Okay, since you are discharged from the hospital, you don't have to go back. However, you should not go to the site within a week, and the lights in the room at night should also be covered with paper."
　　At this time, Old Qiu became anxious again when he saw that Koskin was going to drive him ashore: "Isn't the drilling machine overheating?"
　　"We'll talk about the machine overheating later."
　　"Can I take a look?"
　　Seeing that he was unwilling to leave, Koskin had to say: "You can take a look, but you can't stay too long."
　　When Old Qiu went to disassemble the machine for inspection, he immediately forgot everything, disassembling and assembling the drilling machine, and finally found the problem was that there was a lack of lubrication on the clutch, the lubricating oil could not go down, so it overheated and smoked after ten minutes of friction. He immediately asked someone to find a fitter to chisel an oil groove, and the drilling machine started to run continuously.
　　At this time, Koskin was very happy to see that he had repaired the machine, but he was afraid that he would stay on the pier for too long and affect his health, so he came over and made a "three-chapter agreement" with him: "Our work is normal. In the future, you can come to the site to take a look before 8:00 am and after 5:00 pm every day. At other times, the sunlight is very strong, which is not good for your eyes, so you are not allowed to come."
　　Soon, Old Qiu's second contract period also expired. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company wanted him to go back, and the Yangtze River Bridge Machinery Leasing Station, which was responsible for signing the contract, also agreed to let him go back. The date of departure was set. Old Qiu packed his luggage and decided to go to the pier again to take a look before leaving the next day. As soon as he arrived at the construction site, he saw Koskin on Pier No. 1 and felt a little sad, wanting to avoid Koskin. He went to the pier after seeing that Koskin was gone. Unexpectedly, Koskin was still on the pier when he went up, and waved to him from afar. It turned out that Koskin also knew that Old Qiu was leaving. He then asked him, "Are you going back to Anshan?"
　　"No," Old Qiu replied after a few minutes. "Anshan is a key project, and the bridge is also a key project. It's the same to work anywhere."
　　"Then why do you want to go back?"
　　"The contract period has expired. Ansteel wants me to go back, and they also agreed to let me go, so of course I have to go."
　　"How can we let you go? We need you to stay here. What do you think if we extend the contract period?"
　　Old Qiu thought for a while and said: "Extension is possible, but I don't agree with this method of extending it once every three months. This period is too short, and we can't improve our technology. We will also lose the technology from the mine, and we won't be able to keep up with the work when we go back in the future. If we want to extend it, it should be longer. We will have a foundation for learning underwater drilling, and many bridges will be built in the future, so the experience can be used."
　　"Okay, I will report this opinion to the bureau."
　　Two days later, the bureau decided to extend the contract period by one to two years.
　　At this time, the drilling project was tense, and Old Qiu's lung disease broke out, but he still insisted on working. Every time Koskin saw Old Qiu, he would tell him: "You should arrange your life normally and pay attention to maintaining your health." Once, when the machine malfunctioned, Old Qiu was so anxious that he smoked eleven cigarettes in a row. Koskin saw it next to him but didn't say anything. After the malfunction was overcome, Koskin said to him: "Before, when you didn't have enough cigarettes, I would give you some. Today I saw you asking others for cigarettes, but I didn't give you any. Why? Your health is not good, why are you still smoking? Why not use the money for smoking to maintain your health?"
　　During this year of intense construction, Old Qiu, who originally didn't know how to read drawings very well, can now read drawings with the help of Koskin, and can draw sketches of things he wants to improve. With Koskin's help, he also implemented several rationalization proposals, which played a significant role in improving drilling speed and ensuring operational safety. He also continued to train the second and third batches of new drillers, a total of more than one hundred people. Some of the new drillers trained in the first phase have also served as foreman. Old Qiu was selected as an advanced producer in the entire bureau.
　　These days working with expert Koskin left an unforgettable impression in Qiu Zhenxiang's heart. When he thought of the Min River, thought of building a bridge there using the caisson drilling method, and thought of being able to continue working with Koskin, he made a decision: he would use the new technology he learned from expert Koskin to build a new bridge, he would go to the Min River with Koskin and everyone else!

　　友情
　　曹葆铭　宫强
    当武汉长江大桥的管柱钻孔全部完工，钻工们都忙着收拾机具去岷江修建新桥的时候，丘桢祥展开了激烈的思想斗争：是回鞍山好呢，还是跟大伙一起去用“管柱钻孔法”修建新的桥梁好呢？……他斗争了很久，最后下定决心：到岷江去。
    吸引他到岷江去的原因很多，其中之一就是他同苏联专家柯斯金的友谊。
    当最初决定采用“管柱钻孔法”——这世界最新的技术来修建武汉长江大桥的时候，长江大桥工程局没有一个钻工。丘桢祥就是根据这种需要，从鞍山铁矿赶来的。
    他刚到，苏联专家便找他去研究工作，决定开训练班培养新钻工，由他作教员。他一听这话就急了：“我才念了两个月书，连解放后参加各种训练班的时间一起算上，也没上够两年学，我怎么能讲课呢？”
    专家组长西林用手指了指一个肚子微凸、身体粗壮的苏联专家说：“你教吧！遇到困难，有柯斯金专家帮助你。”柯斯金也接着说：“教人家，也是自己学习的好机会。”
    老丘一开始教学便遇到没有教材的困难，柯斯金就编了一套讲义给他。讲义中有许多技术翻译名词看不懂，他又在柯斯金专家的具体帮助下，和另外两个钻工研究了几天，才算摸着了门路。
    同柯斯金专家最初的接触，给老丘留下了深刻的印象。本来，他一贯认为只要有操作经验就行，不大看得起技术理论和技术人员，遇事也不大肯向人请教。但是，在这个新工作面前，他深切地感到没有理论不行，特别是见到柯斯金这样一个理论和经验都非常丰富的专家，还时常找一个中国工人商量问题，采纳他的意见。他开始改变了自己的态度，有了问题主动找柯斯金专家和中国工程师请教。柯斯金也给他一些钻孔图纸，要他研究学习，提高理论水平。
    丘桢祥在工作中遇到的最大的困难，是他只熟悉矿山钻岩，缺乏水上钻岩的经验。一次，柯斯金问他：“怎么防止管孔里的流砂？”
    “用粘土和片石堵住。”老丘说。
      “万一堵不住又怎么办？”
    “那我下到孔里去看看。”老丘不加思索地回答说。
    在矿山上，他是可以下到大型钻孔里去摸情况、找原因的。
    谁知柯斯金却对他说：“管柱里有三四十公尺深的水，下不去，也抽不干。”
    这个问题难住了老丘和他的伙伴们。他们回到宿舍再谈起这问题时，一个个都只是喝茶，说不出话来。
    果然，钻机一搬到水上，就遇到严重的流砂问题。钻机还没开动多久，管柱内就涌进了六公尺厚的流砂，使钻机带不动钻头。他们用吸泥机将流砂吸出再钻，但没钻上几十分钟，流砂又涌进管柱来了，仍然是六公尺厚。钻岩工作没有丝毫进展。这可把性情急躁的老丘急坏了，他烟卷不离手，一会儿跑上龟山去观察地形的倾斜度，觉得这样的地形不该涌进这么多流砂；一会儿又赶上桥墩平台上去俯视管柱里的情况，只见黑洞洞的，江水很深，什么也看不见。想不到，正当他一心在思索这个问题的时候，他的烟卷头将身旁的瓦斯桶点着了，一声爆炸，顿时将他的眼睛烧伤。
    老丘头天晚上住进医院，柯斯金专家第二天中午便带着苹果、点心看视他来了。他当时又兴奋，又难过，他没想到柯斯金专家这么快就到医院看他来了，同时也觉得自己这么个老工人，还粗心大意，造成事故，真不应该。他两眼蒙着纱布，听见柯斯金专家的沉重的脚步声，便挣扎着要坐起来，只觉得柯斯金的两只大手扶着他，按他继续躺下休息。
      “有什么感觉吗？”柯斯金一连问了两句。
    “工地上有什么问题？”老丘却急着反问道。
      “我们工作很好，问题都解决了。”
    “怎么解决的？”老丘激动起来，追问道。
      “你现在的任务是休养，不要挂念工地上的事。”
    柯斯金专家的慰问，使老丘感到一种同志间的关怀和温暖，也引起了医院里的人们的惊异。他听见医生和护士低声议论一阵以后，有一个姑娘走近前来问他：“你是工程师吗？”
      “不是的，我是工人。”
    “那你领导什么工作？”
      “工人就是干活呗！”
      “那为什么苏联专家来看你？……苏联专家同你很好吗？”
    在老丘住院期间，新钻工们每天都派个代表来探问“丘老师”的伤情，他仍然不断地向他们询问工地的情况。一些机灵点的青年，便拣好的向他说：“原来的流砂问题，专家查出是管柱还差两公寸没下到江底岩层，所以外边的砂子直往里涌。现在，管柱下到岩层后，专家采用抛粘土和片石的办法，把问题解决了。”一些心眼少的青年，便老老实实地告诉他：“流砂问题解决了，又出了个离合器发热的问题。钻机开动上十分钟，离合器就发烧冒烟，得停下来。这样作作停停，一天二十四小时，还干不上三个钟头的活。”老丘一听这话，又急起来了。等眼睛上的纱布解开不久，他便坚持要出院。
      刚出院，他把东西往宿舍里一扔，便向水上工地赶去。他刚下石梯，柯斯金就在墩上望见他了，一边举起双手向他打招呼，一边迎了过来：“好了吗？”柯斯金走近一看，见他的脸色还没复原，便问道：
  “谁叫你出院的？”
      “我自己要出院的。”
      “你为什么要出院？你的脸色还很不好。”
      老丘当时就像犯了错的小学生一样，回答不出来。柯斯金又说：“如果伤势复发，再第二次住院，就麻烦了。医生怎么讲？”
      “医生说眼睛瞎不了，顶多会近视。”
    柯斯金见老丘那个神情，不好多说，便改口道：“好，既然出院了，就不必再回去。不过，你在一星期内不要到现场，晚上房间里的灯光也要用纸挡上。”
    这时，老丘见柯斯金要将他赶上岸去，又急了：“不是钻机发热吗？”
      “机器发热的事，以后再说。”
      “我看看行吗？”
    柯斯金见他赖着不肯走，只好说道：“看看可以，但不能呆太久。”
    老丘去拆开机器检查时，马上就忘掉一切，将钻机拆开又装上，装上又拆开，终于找出毛病在离合器上面缺个油滑，滑润油下不去，所以磨擦十分钟就发热冒烟。他当时叫人去找个钳工来凿了个油槽，钻机就连续不停地开动起来。
    这时，柯斯金见他将机器修好了，挺高兴，但又怕他老留在墩上不走，影响身体健康，便又过来同他“约法三章”：“我们工作正常了。以后，每天上午八点以前，下午五点以后，你可以来现场看看，其他的时间，太阳光很强，对你的眼睛不好，不准来。”
    不久，老丘的第二期合同期限也满了。鞍山钢铁公司要他回去，负责签订合同的长江大桥机械经租站也同意让他回去。动身的日期都确定了。老丘收拾好行李，决定再到桥墩上去看看，第二天就走。他一到工地，望见柯斯金正在一号桥墩上，心里有些难过，想躲开柯斯金。他见柯斯金不在了，才到桥墩上去。谁知一上墩去，柯斯金却还在墩上，并且老远就向他打招呼。原来柯斯金也知道老丘要走了。便问他：“你要回鞍山？”
      “不是的，”老丘停了几分钟才回答说。“鞍山是重点工程，大桥也是重点工程，哪里工作都一样。”
      “那你为什么要回去？”
      “合同期满了，鞍钢要我回去，这边也同意我走，我当然得走。”
      “怎么能让你走呢？这里的工作需要将你留下。如果把合同期限延长，你有什么意见？”
    老丘想了想说：“延期可以，但我不同意这样三个月一次的延期方法。这样期限太短，我们在技术上提不高，又把矿山的那套技术丢生了，将来回去工作跟不上。要延期就长一些，我们学习水上钻岩有了基础，将来还要修建许多大桥，经验也能用上。”
      “好，我把这个意见向局里反映。”
    过了两天，局里就决定将合同期延长一年至两年。
    这时，钻岩工程正紧张，老丘的肺病发了，仍然坚持着工作。柯斯金每次见到老丘都要叮咛他：“你要把生活安排正常些，注意保养身体。”有一次，机器发生故障，老丘急的连着抽了十一根烟卷，柯斯金在旁边看见也没说话。等故障克服了，柯斯金才对他说：“以前，你烟卷不够的时候，我就分一些给你。今天我见你向别人要烟抽，我也没给你，这是为什么？你身体不好，为什么还抽烟呢？为什么不把抽烟的钱用来保养身体呢？”
    在这一年多的紧张施工中，老丘原来连图纸也不大会看，但在柯斯金帮助下，他现在会看图纸了，并且能将自己想要改进的东西绘出草图来。他还在柯斯金帮助下，实现了几项合理化建议，对提高钻进速度，保证操作安全，都起了很大作用。他还继续训练了第二批、第三批新钻工，一共有一百多名。第一期训练出来的新钻工，有的还担任了工长的职务。老丘被评选为全局的先进生产者。
    同柯斯金专家共同工作的这些日子，在丘桢祥的心里留下了难忘的印象。当他想到岷江，想到将要在那里用管柱钻孔法建设大桥，想到能够继续同柯斯金在一起工作，就作出了决定：他要将从柯斯金专家那里学来的新技术用来建设新的桥梁，他要跟柯斯金，跟大伙一起到岷江去！
