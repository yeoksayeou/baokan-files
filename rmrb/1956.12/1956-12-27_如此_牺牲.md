    Such "Sacrifice"
    Recently, U.S. Vice President Nixon "visited" Austria. He said the purpose of this "trip" was to make people aware of the "great sacrifice" Austria had made in the Hungarian incident. Nixon also brought a letter from the U.S. President to the Austrian Chancellor, specifically to "express gratitude" to Austria.
    Nixon's use of the word "sacrifice" is intriguing. Indeed, Austria made a "great sacrifice" in the Hungarian incident! It sacrificed the sovereignty and laws of an independent nation, turning its own territory into a base for large-scale subversive activities against neighboring countries. It allowed U.S. intelligence organizations to carry out various illegal activities in Austria, forcing those Hungarian people who had been deceived into fleeing to Austria to go to the United States, and recruiting a large number of Horthy elements and fascists who had fled from Hungary. After the outbreak of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion, Austria further sacrificed its dignity and reputation as a neutral country, openly "opening" its borders, allowing batches of counter-revolutionaries to pour into Hungary from the Austro-Hungarian border to participate in and expand the rebellion. This is the "sacrifice" Nixon spoke of, but what a "sacrifice" that does not conform to Austria's neutral interests!
    When Nixon returned to Washington, he not only publicized Austria's "sacrifice," but also further expressed special interest in Austria. He said that after learning about Austria's "great work" in the disaster relief of refugees during his visit, he believed that "Americans" should "visit Austria more than before" in the future. It is already clear what dangerous position Washington intends to put Austria in.
    Are Austria's rulers prepared to endure even "greater sacrifices" in Washington's adventurous schemes? (Xue)

    如此“牺牲”
    最近，美国副总统尼克松“访问”了奥地利。他说，这次“旅行”的目的是为了让人们都知道奥地利在匈牙利事件中所作的“伟大牺牲”。尼克松并且带了美国总统给奥地利总理的一封信，特地对奥地利“表示感谢”。
    尼克松用了“牺牲”这两个字，倒是耐人寻味。的确，奥地利在匈牙利事件中作了“伟大牺牲”！它牺牲了作为一个独立国家的主权和法律，而让自己的国土变为一块对邻国进行大规模颠复活动的基地。它允许美国特务组织在奥地利进行种种非法活动，强迫那些被骗跑到奥地利去的匈牙利人民到美国去，并收罗由匈牙利逃出来的大批的霍尔蒂分子和法西斯分子。在匈牙利反革命叛乱发生后，奥地利更牺牲了它作为一个中立国家的尊严和名誉，公开地“开放”边境，让一批批的反革命分子从奥匈边境涌入匈牙利参加和扩大叛乱。这就是尼克松所说的“牺牲”，然而这是多么不符合奥地利中立的利益的“牺牲”！
    尼克松回到华盛顿的时候，已不仅宣扬奥地利的这种“牺牲”，而且进一步对奥地利表示特别的兴趣。他说，经过他这次了解到奥地利在劫运难民方面的“伟大工作”后，他认为“美国人”在今后“应当较前更多地访问奥地利”。华盛顿打算把奥地利摆在什么危险的地位，已经很清楚了。
    奥地利的统治者是不是准备在华盛顿的冒险勾当中承受更“伟大的牺牲”呢？　（雪）
