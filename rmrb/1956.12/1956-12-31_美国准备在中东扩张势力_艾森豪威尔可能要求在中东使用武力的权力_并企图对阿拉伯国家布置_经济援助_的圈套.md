Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Washington - According to a United Press report from Washington, officials in Washington revealed on the 28th that Eisenhower may ask Congress next year for "standby power" to use US armed forces in the Middle East, so that he can use US armed forces in the region without Congressional approval when he deems it "necessary."

Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Cairo - The Washington correspondent for "Al-Ahram" believes that the US President's possible request for "standby power" to use force in the Middle East is to use "deterrence" to support the "economic and political policies that the United States will inevitably adopt" in the Middle East, in order to "take advantage of the prestige and leadership position that the United States has gained (in the Middle East) by opposing the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt."

The newspaper pointed out that although the United States intends to use the United Nations to promote its policies on the Middle East issue, this does not rule out the United States exercising its "pressure" and "influence" to make individual countries comply with its will and "cooperate more closely with the United Nations."

Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Washington - US Senator Mansfield, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed disagreement with giving the President "standby power" to use force in the Middle East.

Mansfield told reporters on the 29th: "Unilateral action by us in the Middle East will cause many problems and put us in the same position as the British, French, and Israelis, whom we condemned."

He advocated promoting US policies through the United Nations. He said: "I would support the President's suggestion to give (the United Nations) a permanent police force with (American) Marine Division and an Air Force Wing. But I will not support the President's request for authorization to send American troops alone."

Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: New York - According to a TASS report from New York on the 28th, the American press reported that the United States is attempting to use so-called "economic aid" to Arab countries to squeeze out British and French economic interests in the Middle East.

Associated Press reporter James Marlow wrote: "Currently, when the British and French are disgraced, the United States, even if it cannot become the dominant factor in the Middle East, can at least become a powerful factor."

"New York Times" reporter Reston said that US officials "attach great importance to plans to help the Middle East region restore its economy."

Frederick, the Washington correspondent for the "Chicago Sun-Times," revealed the US plot to drag Middle Eastern countries into the Baghdad Pact with so-called "economic aid." He pointed out that when US representatives negotiated with Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi in Washington, they attempted to exert pressure on Egypt to force it to join the Baghdad Pact. He said: "This attempt coincides with the implication that the nature of the Baghdad Pact may change. It is said that the focus of the Baghdad Pact will be on economic aspects, not military aspects."

Frederick also said that the US proposal was threatening in nature, and if it were rejected, "the United States might really try to isolate Egypt."

    美国准备在中东扩张势力
    艾森豪威尔可能要求在中东使用武力的权力
    并企图对阿拉伯国家布置“经济援助”的圈套
    新华社29日讯　据合众社华盛顿消息，华盛顿官员28日透露，艾森豪威尔可能在明年向国会要求给他在中东使用美国武装部队的“备用权力”，好让他在他认为“必要”的时候不必经国会同意就可以在这个地区使用美国武装部队。
    据新华社30日讯　开罗“金字塔报”驻华盛顿记者认为，美国总统可能要求给予他在中东使用武力的“备用权力”，这是要用“威慑”手段来支持美国在中东“必然会采取的……经济和政治方面的政策”，以便“利用美国由于反对英法侵略埃及而（在中东）取得的威信和领导地位”。
    这家报纸指出，尽管美国在中东问题上打算利用联合国组织来推行它的政策，但是这并不排除美国行使它的“压力”和“影响”来使个别国家顺从它的意志，“更紧密地同联合国合作”。
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国参议院外交委员会委员、民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德表示不同意给总统以在中东使用武力的“备用权力”。
    曼斯菲尔德29日对记者说：“我们单独进入中东的行动将会引起许多问题，这样做，会使我们自己处在我们所谴责的英法以三国所处的地位。
    他主张通过联合国来推行美国的政策。他说：“如果总统建议给（联合国）永久性的警察部队以（美国的）一师海军陆战队和一个空军联队，我是会支持这种建议的。但是我不会支持总统请求授权单独派遣美国军队去的做法。
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社纽约28日讯：据美国报界报道，美国正在企图利用所谓对阿拉伯国家的“经济援助”来排挤英法在中东的经济利益。
    美联社记者詹姆斯·马劳写道：“目前，当英国人和法国人名誉扫地的时候，美国在中东即使不能成为主导因素，至少也可以成为强有力的因素。”
    “纽约时报”记者赖斯顿说，美国官方人士“非常重视帮助中东地区恢复经济的计划”。
    “芝加哥太阳时报”驻华盛顿记者弗雷德里克透露了美国打算用所谓“经济援助”来把中东国家拖进巴格达条约的计谋。他指出，美国代表同埃及外交部长法齐在华盛顿进行谈判的时候，曾经企图对埃及施行压力，迫使埃及参加巴格达条约。他说：“这种企图是同巴格达条约的性质可能改变的暗示相吻合的。据说巴格达条约的重点将放在经济方面，而不放在军事方面。”
    弗雷德里克还说，美国的建议带有威胁性质，如果它被拒绝的话，“美国就可能真的设法使埃及孤立起来”。
