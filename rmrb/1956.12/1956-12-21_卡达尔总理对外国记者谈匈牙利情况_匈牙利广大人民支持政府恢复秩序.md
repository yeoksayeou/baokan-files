Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 20th - Premier Kadar of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government answered several questions posed by a reporter from the German Democratic Republic radio station on December 19th in the Parliament Building. Reporters from radio stations and newspapers of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, China, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union, as well as reporters from newspapers of Communist parties in some capitalist countries, were also present when Kadar answered the questions.

Kadar first stated that the counter-revolutionary forces in Hungary had been defeated. Currently, broad strata of the people support the government's fundamental goal: restoring order. He said that although the armed struggle against the counter-revolution only lasted a few days, the political struggle may still last a long time, especially since the counter-revolutionary forces are hiding.

Kadar said that a new situation emerged approximately two weeks ago. This situation is characterized by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party organizing its own ranks throughout the country. The second sign of change is the demonstration marches of Communist revolutionaries in the streets of Budapest. Workers appeared in three or four locations in Budapest carrying national flags and red flags.

Kadar then spoke about the workers' councils. He said that the establishment of workers' councils was considered even before October 23rd because they are useful organizations that contribute to the further democratization of economic life. Subsequently, when talking about the so-called Budapest Central Workers' Council that had been dissolved by the government, he said: "Radio Free Europe" demanded that we hand over power to the Central Workers' Council, and we cannot agree to such a practice.

We believe that the issue of workers' councils is a Hungarian issue. Comrade Kardelj, a leader of our friendly Yugoslavia, has also spoken on this issue. Comrade Kardelj said that the Hungarian government is wrong not to rely on the workers' councils. I believe that we are better at assessing our own situation here than Comrade Kardelj is in Belgrade. But, apart from that, he is also wrong in principle. He cited Lenin's words in 1917: "All power to the Soviets!" This slogan of Lenin's has been proven completely correct by history, but it is particularly worth noting that Lenin put forward this slogan against the bourgeois state power. In Hungary in November 1956, there was a proletarian regime, and it would be wrong if it recognized the workers' councils in the hands of the counter-revolution.

Kadar said: The government cannot rely on those organizations organized by counter-revolutionaries, even if these organizations call themselves workers' councils. When this comrade takes this position on this issue, he probably does not know that this workers' council is planning to expel the Communists from the various workers' councils. We believe that the Central Workers' Council's demand to control the forces maintaining public order is a purely counter-revolutionary demand. If Comrade Kardelj knew more about these things, he would revise his position. The twelve members of the former Budapest Central Workers' Council, although their Marxist cultivation is not as good as Comrade Kardelj's, in fact agreed with our practice. They agreed to dissolve the regional workers' councils and supported the government. We estimate that we can complete the task of politically eliminating the counter-revolutionary forces in a relatively short period of time through political struggle.

Regarding the Hungarian economic problems, Kadar said that the current economic situation in Hungary is very difficult, with a shortage of raw materials, especially coal and electricity. Some of the difficulties existed before, but this year the difficulties are particularly numerous. There were floods in the spring, droughts in the summer, an earthquake in January, and the incident in October. Many people participated in this incident, and we stopped production for five or six weeks, which greatly affected the national economy. However, since there is a core of production—the metallurgical industry and the machine-building industry—all these difficulties can be overcome. In order to prevent inflation, we must do our best to restore production, which the Hungarian working people now see very clearly. They are doing their best to avoid inflation.

Kadar said that we must further promote democracy and rely on the support of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals. If the broad masses do not support us, our work will not be successful. The achievements we have made are the result of the joint efforts of the working people, the Hungarian armed forces, and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government.

    卡达尔总理对外国记者谈匈牙利情况
    匈牙利广大人民支持政府恢复秩序
    反革命势力已经失败，但是政治斗争仍然可能历时很久。南斯拉夫的卡德尔同志对匈牙利工人委员会的看法在原则上是不对的。现在匈牙利经济情况很困难，劳动人民认识到必须尽力恢复生产，避免通货膨胀。
    新华社布达佩斯20日电　匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔12月19日在议会大厦回答了德意志民主共和国电台记者所提出的几个问题。卡达尔回答问题的时候，保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、中国、波兰、罗马尼亚和苏联各国电台和报刊的记者和一些资本主义国家共产党报纸的记者也在场。
    卡达尔首先说，匈牙利的反革命势力已经失败。现在，人民中的广大阶层支持政府的根本目标：恢复秩序。他说，虽然反对反革命的武装斗争曾经只进行了几天，但是，政治斗争仍然可能历时很久，特别是由于反革命势力正在隐藏起来。
    卡达尔说，大概在两个星期以前，新情况出现了。这种情况的特点是匈牙利社会主义工人党在全国各地组织了自己的队伍。情况转变的第二个标志是，布达佩斯的街头上出现了共产党人革命者的示威游行。工人打着国旗和红旗在布达佩斯的三、四个地方出现。
    卡达尔接着谈到工人委员会的问题。他说，在10月23日以前就考虑过要成立工人委员会，因为这是有用的组织，有助于经济生活的进一步民主化。随后他在谈到被政府解散的所谓布达佩斯中央工人委员会的时候说：“自由欧洲”电台要求我们把政权交给中央工人委员会，我们不能够同意这样的作法。
    我们认为工人委员会的问题是匈牙利的问题。我们友好的南斯拉夫的一位领导人卡德尔同志也对这个问题讲了话。卡德尔同志说，匈牙利政府不依靠工人委员会是做得不对的。我认为，我们在这里估计自己的情况比卡德尔同志在贝尔格莱德估计要好。但是，除此之外，他在原则上也是不对的。他引证了列宁在1917年的话：“一切政权归苏维埃！”列宁这个口号已为历史证实是完全正确的，但是，值得特别注意的是，列宁是针对资产阶级国家政权提出这个口号的。在1956年11月的匈牙利存在的是无产阶级政权，如果它承认处在反革命手中的工人委员会，那就不对了。
    卡达尔说：政府不能依靠那些由反革命分子所组织的机构，即使这些机构自命为工人委员会的话。当这位同志对这个问题采取这种立场的时候，他大概不知道这个工人委员会正打算把共产党人从各个工人委员会中逐出去的情况。我们认为，中央工人委员会要求掌握维持治安的部队的这种要求是一个纯粹的反革命要求。如果卡德尔同志对这些事情知道得更多，他就会修改他的主张。过去的布达佩斯中央工人委员会的十二名委员，尽管他们的马克思主义修养不及卡德尔同志，但是，在事实上赞同了我们的作法。他们赞同解散区域性的工人委员会，而且支持政府。我们估计可以在较短的时间内，通过政治斗争来完成从政治上消灭反革命势力的任务。
    关于匈牙利经济问题，卡达尔说，现在匈牙利经济情况很困难，原料不足，煤和电力特别感到缺乏。有些困难本来是以前就有的，只是今年困难特别多。春天有水灾，夏天有旱灾，1月里发生了地震，10月内又发生了事变。这次事变许多人都参加了进去，我们停止了生产有五、六个星期，这在很大程度上影响了国家经济。但是，既然存在着生产核心——冶金工业和机器制造工业，所有这些困难都是可以克服的。为了防止通货膨胀，必须全力恢复生产，这一点，匈牙利劳动人民现在是看得很清楚的。他们在尽力避免通货膨胀。
    卡达尔说，我们要进一步发扬民主，依靠工人、农民和革命知识分子的支持。如果广大群众不支持我们，我们的工作就不能取得成就。我们已取得的成就是劳动人民、匈牙利武装部队、工农革命政府共同努力的成果。
