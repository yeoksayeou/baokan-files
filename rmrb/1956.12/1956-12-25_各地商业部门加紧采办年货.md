Xinhua News Agency, 24th. According to statistics from the Urban Service Department, among the non-staple foods prepared for supply during the 1957 New Year's Day and Spring Festival, there are 1.8 million pigs, an increase of 300,000 pigs compared to the supply during New Year's Day and Spring Festival this year. More than 3 million frozen chickens and ducks are already prepared. Other fruits, vegetables, dried and fresh goods can basically guarantee the needs of urban and rural people during the holidays.

　　State-owned commercial departments in large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin have also prepared various festive pastries and fruits according to the local citizens' holiday customs. Shanghai citizens like to eat melon seeds during the holidays, and the commercial departments have specially transported hundreds of thousands of kilograms of sunflower seeds from the Northeast. The glutinous rice flour used by Shanghai citizens to make yuanxiao for the Spring Festival is also being processed. Experienced master chefs from pastry shops such as Xiang Dezai, Gui Shunzhai, and Yipinxiang, which belong to Tianjin's Sugar and Pastry Company, will make more than 100 kinds of pastries for supply. The commercial departments in Chongqing are preparing to supply approximately one million kilograms of tangyuan noodles, tangyuan fillings, and candies.

　　Starting from the fourth quarter, more than 1,100 purchasing agents from the four cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Wuhan have been dispatched to various regions to procure New Year goods, and their footprints have spread across the country. The purchasing agents dispatched to Inner Mongolia are assisting in the slaughter of cattle and sheep in the frozen and snowy weather. People purchasing poultry are staying up all night to take care of the chickens and ducks on trucks.

　　Relevant departments in various regions are studying how to ensure the supply to large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas, while also taking into account the needs of small and medium-sized towns and the vast rural areas, based on the demand for New Year goods and the availability of goods. Chongqing has decided to concentrate the supply of some non-staple foods with relatively few sources on the Spring Festival, appropriately reducing the supply for New Year's Day. Most farmers in the suburbs of Chongqing prepare their own preserved meat, and the preserved meat prepared by the city's commercial departments will mainly supply the needs of industrial and mining areas and urban residents. State-owned companies in Shanghai will formulate a new method for selling pork to avoid overcrowding when citizens purchase pork. Wuhan will adopt a method of rationing pork, glutinous rice cakes, bean threads, and other materials that are in high demand among citizens based on tickets to achieve reasonable distribution.

　　The festival supply materials in various provinces are also being actively prepared. Hebei Province discussed the supply of Spring Festival materials at the financial and economic work conference held in mid-December. Shaanxi Province has already transported New Year and Spring Festival materials to various regions in advance. It is estimated that the province's supply of grain, coal, local products, meat, and daily necessities during the 1957 New Year and Spring Festival will be about double that of this year's New Year and Spring Festival.

    各地商业部门加紧采办年货
    新华社24日讯　据城市服务部统计，准备在1 957年元旦、春节供应的副食品中，猪有一百八十万头，比今年元旦、春节的供应量增加了三十万头；已经冻好的鸡鸭有三百多万只。其他水果、蔬菜、干鲜货等，基本上都可以保证城乡人民节日吃用。
    上海、天津等大城市的国营商业部门，还根据当地市民的节日习惯，准备了各种应节的糕点瓜果。上海市民节日爱嗑瓜子，商业部门特地从东北运来了几十万斤葵花子；上海市民春节做元宵用的糯米粉也正在加工。天津市糖业糕点公司所属的祥德斋、桂顺斋和一品香等糕点商店，有经验的老师傅将要做出一百多种糕点来供应。重庆市商业部门准备供应的汤元面、汤元心子和糖果等约有一百万斤。
    从第四季度开始，北京、上海、天津、武汉四个市派到各地采办年货的采购员有一千一百多人，他们的足迹遍及全国。派到内蒙古的采购员，正在冰天雪地里协助宰杀牛羊。采购家禽的人，彻夜不眠地在货车上照顾鸡鸭。
    各地有关部门正在根据年货的需要量和货源情况，研究如何做到既保证大中城市和工矿区的供应，又照顾到中小城镇和广大农村的需要。重庆市对于若干货源较少的副食品，决定集中在春节供应，适当缩小元旦的供应量。重庆市郊区农民多数自备腊肉，市商业部门准备的腊肉将主要供应工矿区和市区居民的需要。上海市国营公司将订出一种新的销售猪肉的办法，以避免市民购买猪肉时发生拥挤现象。武汉市对市民需要量大的猪肉、糍粑、豆丝等物资，将采取凭票定量供应的办法，以做到合理分配。
    各省的节日供应物资，也在积极准备。河北省在12月中旬召开的财经工作会议上，讨论了春节物资的供应问题；陕西省已经提前把新年和春节物资运到各地，预计全省在1957年年节供应的粮食、煤炭、土产品、肉类和日用百货，将比今年年节增加一倍左右。
