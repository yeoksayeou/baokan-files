    In some areas of Henan Province, leaders believe that large-scale well-digging this spring was not beneficial.
　　Should this work be stopped, or should it continue to move forward?
　　After conducting thorough investigations and research from various perspectives, the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Planning Committee believes that:
　　Farmland Water Conservancy Work Should Not Stop
　　A policy of actively, resolutely, and systematically consolidating and developing should be adopted
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 6th. The person in charge of the Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Planning Committee told Xinhua News Agency reporters: In the future, Henan Province's farmland water conservancy construction work will adopt a policy of active, resolute, and systematically consolidating and developing. The purpose of this committee in proposing this policy is to correct the negative attitude taken by some areas towards farmland water conservancy construction work.
    The person in charge said: The leadership had serious shortcomings and errors in leading the previous period of farmland water conservancy movement, such as being overly demanding and not paying enough attention to regional characteristics. These shortcomings and errors have been corrected after the first Congress of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in July. However, after criticizing this blind and rash tendency, some areas have developed another negative emotion, with insufficient recognition of the achievements of the farmland water conservancy movement centered on well-digging this spring. They mistakenly believe that natural disasters in Henan in recent years have been floods rather than droughts, and that large-scale well-digging like this spring has no benefit for production. Therefore, the leading organs in some areas do not plan to lead farmland water conservancy construction work anymore, and have begun to abolish the departments leading water conservancy construction and transfer cadres away. Some have even cancelled the project of small-scale farmland water conservancy construction when arranging next year's production plan, advocating to postpone or stop farmland water conservancy construction.
    The person in charge said: Should it be stopped, or should it continue to move forward? The Henan Provincial Water Conservancy Planning Committee conducted in-depth investigations and research from various perspectives. The results of the investigation show that: In addition to an average of more than 15 million mu of farmland in the province suffering from flood disasters and reduced production every year, there is also a considerable amount of farmland that cannot be sown in time due to drought, and crops cannot grow normally. The reduced production figure for this part of the farmland reaches about 3 billion jin. Therefore, Henan must not only vigorously manage various rivers to prevent floods, but also mobilize the masses to carry out small-scale water conservancy projects to prevent droughts. The investigation also proved that: In areas suitable for water conservancy construction that have implemented water conservancy, various crops have achieved significant increases in production after irrigation, and the vast number of farmers generally demand the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects.
    The person in charge said that, especially importantly: Among the more than 1.04 million wells completed in the previous stage, except for 50,000 wells that have become abandoned wells due to poor geological conditions and poor technology, 50.3% of the remaining wells can irrigate 30 mu of land per well. Another 49.7% of the wells can only irrigate an average of about 15 mu of land per well, which can only be regarded as semi-finished wells and need further processing and improvement. After the wells are completed, it is also necessary to arrange waterwheels, level the land, and learn and master irrigation techniques, and this part of the workload is very large. If leadership is not actively carried out and the improvement of shallow wells and irrigation work is strengthened, the new wells completed last year will not be able to fully exert their irrigation effectiveness, which will result in a huge waste.
    The person in charge said that, according to this situation, Henan's farmland water conservancy movement cannot be stopped, and it should still be carried out as an important measure for increasing agricultural production. According to this requirement, Henan Province has recently held a meeting of commissioners and county heads to deploy the tasks for this winter and next spring, requiring that in addition to low-lying, flood-prone, and hilly areas that should especially emphasize flood prevention and soil and water conservation work according to local conditions, the plain areas will improve 100,000 shallow wells, promote 250,000 waterwheels, dig 30,000 lower spring wells, and dig 80,000 new wells, and will also repair some farmland irrigation projects.

### 农田水利工作不应该停下来

    河南省有些地区的领导人员认为今年春天大规模打井没有什么好处。
　　这工作究竟是应该停下来呢，还是继续前进？
　　河南省水利规划委员会从多方面进行了深入的调查研究以后，认为：
　　农田水利工作不应该停下来
　　应该采取积极地坚决地有计划地巩固和发展的方针
    新华社郑州6日电　河南省水利规划委员会负责人向新华社记者说：今后河南省兴修农田水利的工作，将要采取积极地、坚决地、有计划地巩固和发展的方针。这个委员会提出这个方针的目的，是为了纠正部分地区对兴修农田水利工作所采取的消极态度。
    这位负责人说：领导上在领导过去一段兴修农田水利运动中是有要求过急、照顾地区特点不够的严重缺点和错误的。这些缺点和错误在7月间中共河南省第一次代表大会后已经进行了纠正。但是部分地区在批判这种盲目冒进偏向以后，却又产生了另外一种消极情绪，对今年春季以打井为中心的农田水利运动的成绩认识不足，他们错误地认为：河南连年来的自然灾害是水灾而不是旱灾，像今年春天那样大规模的打井，对于生产没有什么好处。因此，有些地区的领导机关不打算再领导兴修农田水利的工作了，并且开始把领导水利建设的部门撤销，把干部调走；有的在安排明年生产计划的时候，竟把兴修小型农田水利这个项目取消，主张把农田水利的建设缓一缓或者停下来。
    这位负责人说：究竟是停下来呢，还是应该继续前进？河南省水利规划委员会从多方面进行了深入的调查研究。调查结果表明：全省除了平均每年要有一千五百多万亩田地遭受水灾减产外，还有不少田地因受天旱影响不能适时播种，作物不能正常生长，这部分田地的减产数字要达三十亿斤左右。因此，河南不仅要大力治理各河流防止水灾，而且还要发动群众，兴办小型水利工程，预防旱灾。调查的情况还证明：宜于兴修水利又兴修了水利的地区，经过灌溉，各种作物都获得了显著的增产，广大农民都普遍要求兴修小型水利工程。
    负责人说，特别重要的是：前一阶段完成的一百零四万多眼水井中，除了有五万眼因地层不好、技术差已成废井外，其余的有百分之五十点三的水井，每井可浇地三十亩；另有百分之四十九点七的水井，平均每井只浇地十五亩左右，这只能算作半成井，需要进一步加工和改善。水井完成后，还需要安排水车，平整土地，学习与掌握灌溉技术等具体工作，而这部分工作量是很大的。如果不积极进行领导，加强改善浅井和灌溉工作，去年已经完成的新井将不能充分发挥灌溉的效能，这样，就要形成极大的浪费。
    负责人说，根据这种情况，河南的农田水利运动是不能停下来的，它仍旧应当作为农业增产上的一个重要措施来进行。根据这个要求，河南省已在最近举行了专员、县长会议，布置了今冬明春的任务，要求除低洼易涝和山岗丘陵区应根据当地条件特别强调防涝、水土保持工作外，平原地区将改善浅井十万眼，推销水车二十五万部，下泉三万眼，打新井八万眼，并且将要修理一部分田间灌溉工程。
