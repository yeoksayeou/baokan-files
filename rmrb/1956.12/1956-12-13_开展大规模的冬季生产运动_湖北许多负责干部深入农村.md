Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 12th: The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee recently organized a large number of responsible cadres to go deep into the countryside to help leaders at all levels quickly launch a large-scale winter agricultural production campaign throughout the province. The cadres going to the countryside include Zhao Xinchu, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, Zeng Dun, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, and other members of the Provincial Party Committee, as well as the directors and heads of the departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee.

This year, Hubei Province has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in agriculture. Since the beginning of winter, although agricultural production has been carried out to some extent in some areas, a large-scale production campaign has not yet been formed in most areas. At this time last year, the winter manure accumulation and water conservancy construction campaign had already been widely launched throughout the province. The leadership in Hubei Province believes that this will inevitably affect next year's agricultural production increase.

The reason why Hubei Province's winter agricultural production has not been launched on a large scale in a timely manner this year is mainly because many farmers, including some cadres, have developed complacency and the idea of ​​"production increase reaching the top" due to the bumper harvest. They believe that winter is a slack season and they can take a rest; this year's favorable weather conditions have resulted in a bumper harvest, and next year's weather conditions may not be so good, making it difficult to increase production again. Some farmers and grassroots cadres also believe that the bumper harvest is mainly due to favorable weather conditions rather than the result of organizing cooperatives and active labor; in addition, the distribution of some agricultural production cooperatives has not been finalized in time, and farmers are not clear about their final income this year, which also affects their enthusiasm for increasing production next year.

In order to solve these problems, the three-level cadre meetings and township and community cadre meetings held in various counties of Hubei Province recently universally examined and criticized the idea of ​​"production increase reaching the top" and complacency, and formulated new production plans. Various localities have also conducted education on the superiority of cooperation for the vast number of cadres and activists by summarizing their work, changing the thinking of many people who rely on the weather; at the same time, many regions have strengthened the leadership of the autumn harvest distribution work and actively solved some outstanding problems in the autumn harvest distribution. However, because many local organizations and leading cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of immediately launching a large-scale winter production campaign, many places have not yet been able to quickly and comprehensively launch the winter production campaign. Some township and community cadres have even abandoned their leadership over current production. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the primary key to solving this problem is that leading cadres must immediately go deep into the grassroots level to personally study and solve problems. After this group of responsible cadres from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee goes to the countryside, a large number of leading cadres from organizations at all levels will also go deep down to lead the winter production campaign.

### 开展大规模的冬季生产运动  湖北许多负责干部深入农村

    开展大规模的冬季生产运动
    湖北许多负责干部深入农村
    新华社武汉12日电　中共湖北省委员会和省人民委员会最近组织大批负责干部深入农村，帮助各级领导迅速在全省范围内开展一个大规模的冬季农业生产运动。下乡的干部中包括中共湖北省委书记赵辛初、省委宣传部长曾惇和其他一些省委委员以及省人民委员会的厅、局长。
    今年，湖北省农业获得了空前的丰收。入冬以来，农业生产虽然在部分地区有所开展，但大部地区都没形成有规模的生产运动。而在去年的这一时候，冬季积肥和兴修水利运动已在全省范围内广泛展开。湖北省的领导方面认为，这样下去，势必影响明年的农业增产。
    今年湖北省冬季农业生产所以没能及时大规模开展起来，主要是由于很多农民包括一部分干部因为丰收而产生了自满情绪和“增产到顶”的思想，他们认为冬季是闲季，可以歇歇了；今年风调雨顺获得丰收，明年不一定有这样的好年景，再要增产就很困难。还有一部分农民和基层干部认为丰收主要不是因为组织了合作社和积极劳动的结果，而是由于风调雨顺；另外，部分农业生产合作社的分配还没及时作出决算，农民对今年的最后收入不摸底，也影响了对明年增产的积极性。
    为了解决这些问题，在最近湖北省各县召开的三级干部会议和乡社干部会议上普遍检查批判了“增产到顶”的思想和自满情绪，制定了新的生产规划。各地并通过总结工作的方式，向广大干部和农民积极分子进行了一次合作化优越性的教育，改变了很多人靠天吃饭的思想；同时很多地区加强了对秋收分配工作的领导，积极解决秋收分配中的一些遗留问题。但由于不少地方组织和领导干部对立即开展一个大规模的冬季生产运动的重大意义认识不足，所以直到现在很多地方还没有把冬季生产运动迅速全面开展起来。甚至一些乡和社的干部放弃了对当前生产的领导。中共湖北省委员会认为，解决这一问题的首要关键是领导干部必须立即深入下层，亲自研究并解决问题。湖北省委这批负责干部下乡后，随之也将有各级组织的大批领导干部深入下去，领导开展冬季生产运动。
