    Going to Laos
    By Zhan Chao, Our Correspondent

    The air route from Hanoi, capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to Vientiane, capital of the Kingdom of Laos, is over 600 kilometers, and the flight only takes one hour and fifty minutes.

    Having been to one neighboring country, now I'm going to another. This country is both unfamiliar and somehow familiar. I feel like I'm going to visit a relative I've never met before, and I can't suppress the excitement in my heart.

    I don't know when the plane took off. In the morning light, the wide Red River, the slender Long Bien Bridge, and the poetic and lively Hanoi are slowly receding behind us.

    The plane carries us over the flat Red River Delta and comes to the sky over the Black River valley with its high mountains and narrow valleys. Fluffy clouds like cotton wool quickly flash under the fuselage. In front of the fuselage, mountain peaks higher and greener than the last, the continuous and unbroken mountain range, that is the famous Truong Son Range. This mountain range is the southern extension of the Hengduan Mountains in southwestern China, forming a natural border line in northwestern and central Vietnam and northeastern and central Laos, and makes Laos' terrain particularly high, thus earning the reputation of the "Roof of Indochina."

    At this moment, a Polish friend sitting in front greeted me lively, opened a bottle of cherry wine, and insisted that I join him in a toast. This Polish friend's name is Lublinski, and he works at the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission in Vietnam. He has been here for a long time since he came from his home country. His work requires him to fly frequently between Hanoi, Vientiane, Phnom Penh, and Saigon. Lublinski finds everything very pleasant except for the slightly hot weather, because he can personally participate in the implementation of the Geneva Accords, see the war of aggression against Indochina launched by the colonialists for many years come to a halt, see North Vietnam vigorously carry out peaceful construction, and see the Kingdom of Cambodia effectively implement a policy of peace and neutrality. And now this country directly in front of us—the Kingdom of Laos—is also moving along this path. All of these are things that all peace-loving people should be happy about. Although I can't drink alcohol, I still raised my glass and, for peace and friendship, for Lublinski and his friends' meaningful work, and also for my first friendly visit to Laos, drank it all in one gulp.

    The plane continued to rise, and the flight schedule told us that we had entered the northeastern airspace of Laos. Looking out of the window, the high peaks of the Truong Son Range stand like islands on the boundless sea of clouds. After another period of time, the scenery under the fuselage is different: the white clouds have disappeared without a trace, and all that can be seen is an endless expanse of mountains and dense forests. Although the sunlight is so good, it is difficult to distinguish their heights, and only at the watershed can their different outlines be distinguished somewhat. I believe that anyone who comes here will be surprised by the abundance of Laos' mountain and forest resources. According to statistics, the total land area of Laos is more than 230,000 square kilometers, but mountains and forests account for four-fifths of the total area. The mountains and forests of Laos are mainly distributed in the northeastern and eastern regions, ranging from ninety meters to two thousand meters above sea level. In addition to storing large amounts of valuable timber and other forest products, the mountains and forests of Laos also contain many important mineral resources underground. Water resources are also very abundant. Looking down from the plane, you can often see a sparkling stream of rapid water rushing straight down from the high mountains, sometimes two or three, flowing down from a mountain in several directions. These streams converge into many rivers, some of which eventually flow into the largest and most famous Mekong River, flowing south through Cambodia and South Vietnam and into the Pacific Ocean; some rivers flow eastward all the way, passing through the Nghe An province of North Vietnam and into the sea. Water can not only supply Laos with a large amount of power in the future, but also allow this landlocked country to find ports.

    It is almost impossible to keep looking at the continuous mountains. Lublinski shrugged, pulled down the curtains, and we half-reclined and continued our pleasant chat using Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, French, and English words that we could remember, plus gestures. Nearby were several Indian friends from the International Commission, who were also amused by this conversation conducted in a special way, with kind smiles hanging on the corners of their mouths. One of them, I remember meeting him first at Gia Lam Airport, came over and pointed to the clock, telling me the time of takeoff.

    Suddenly, there seemed to be a flash of light outside the plane window. Lublinski casually said two words: "Mekong." Pulling back the curtains, it was indeed the long-famous Mekong River. Although it was still far away at this time, it already made people feel that there was a large river in front of them. The mountain terrain here also drops sharply, followed by rolling hills, and then a fairly wide plain. This is a stretch of alluvial plains connected by a large amount of sediment brought by the Mekong River. According to statistics from 1953, Laos has a total population of more than 2.6 million people, a large part of whom live on the plains along the Mekong River. More than 400,000 hectares of arable land in the country are also mainly distributed in this area. The soil here is fertile, and the climate conditions are good, suitable for the growth of various tropical plants. It is said that rice can be harvested three times a year. Rice is the main food of the Lao people. The rice planting area accounts for about 80% of the total cultivated land.

    The plane glides at low altitude, and the scenery on the Mekong River plain is clearly visible: the fields seem to be a wide carpet woven from green and yellow yarn, and people have begun to harvest crops in places that have turned completely yellow; villages composed of stilt houses are hidden in the green trees; several red roads cut through the fields and stretch into the distance; over there is the Mekong River with boats dotted on it; the bend of the river is probably Vientiane, the capital of the Kingdom of Laos. Golden pagodas, uniquely laid out buildings, black asphalt roads, and so on. But before I had time to see clearly, the plane had crossed the Mekong River, circled slightly over Thailand for a short half circle, then turned back to the east bank of the river, and landed at "Xieng Khouang" Airport, five kilometers from the center of Vientiane.

    Lublinski still has to continue his journey. When we shook hands to say goodbye, we only heard him say "Here we are." Indeed, I have stepped on the land of Laos. "Goodbye, friend, I wish you a safe journey!"

    到老挝去
    本报记者　展潮
    从越南民主共和国首都河内到老挝王国首都万象，空中行程六百多公里，飞机只需要航行一小时又五十分钟就到达了。
    到了一个邻国，现在又到另外一个邻国去。这个国家是那么地陌生又那么地稔熟。我好像是将要到一个从没有去过的亲戚家里作客似的，一直压抑不住心头上的兴奋。
    不知什么时候飞机已经升上了天空。在晨曦里，宽阔的红河，修长的龙编大铁桥、富有诗情画意同时又洋溢着生活气息的河内，都慢慢地退到后面去了。
    飞机载着我们越过了平坦的红河三角洲，来到了高山狭谷的黑水江流域的上空。一团团棉絮似的浮云，迅速地在机身下面掠过。机身前面，一座比一座更高的、绿得有点发黑的、连绵不绝的山峰，那就是有名的长山山脉了。这条山脉，是中国西南横断山脉南走的余峰，在越南的西北部和中部以及老挝的东北部和中部构成了一条天然的国境线，并且使老挝的地势特别高，因而得到了“印度支那屋脊”的名声。
    这时候，坐在前面的一位波兰朋友活泼地向我打了下招呼，随手就把身边的一瓶樱桃酒打开，非要我一同干杯不可。这位波兰朋友名叫鲁布林斯基，在越南国际监督和监察委员会工作。他从自己的祖国来到这里已经很久了，他的工作要求他坐上飞机经常地来往于河内—万象—金边—西贡之间。鲁布林斯基除了觉得天气有点热之外，他觉得一切很愉快，因为能够亲身参与执行日内瓦协议的工作，看到延续了许多年的殖民者发动侵略印度支那的战争停止下来了，看到越南北方正在大力进行和平建设，看到柬埔寨王国成效卓著地执行着和平中立政策，而现在在我们正前方的这个国家——老挝王国，也沿着这条道路前行。所有这些，都是值得一切爱好和平人们庆幸的事。我虽然不能喝酒，但还是举起杯来，为了和平和友谊，为了鲁布林斯基和他的朋友们的有意义的工作，也为了我第一次到老挝进行友好访问，一饮而尽。
    飞机继续向上升，航程表告诉我们已经进入老挝东北部领空。鸟瞰窗外，但见长山山脉的高峰仿佛一座座岛屿似的峙立在无边无沿的云涛上面。再过一段时间，机身下面却又是另外一种景色：白云不知什么时候收敛得无影无踪，眼前只是一片望不到边的丛山密林。虽然阳光是那么好，也很难分出它们的高低，只是到了分水岭的地方才能多少辨别出它们不同的轮廓来。我相信不论任何人到这里，都会惊觉老挝山林资源之丰盛的。据统计，老挝全国土地面积是二十三万多平方公里，山林却占总面积的五分之四。老挝山林主要分布在东北部和东部地区，拔海自九十公尺到二千公尺。老挝山林里除了储备大量贵重的木材和其他林产外，地下还蕴藏着许多重要的矿产。水源也非常充足，从飞机上俯视，往往可以看见一条银光闪闪的急湍的流水自高山上直奔下去，有时是两条三条，从一座山上向几面流泻。这些流水汇成了许多条河流，其中有些最后归进最大和最著名的湄公河，向南流经柬埔寨和越南南方而入太平洋；有些河流一直向东流，经过越南北方义安省一带而入海。水不仅将来可以供给老挝大量的动力，水还可以使这个内陆国家找到港口。
    要想坚持着看那连绵不绝的山峦几乎是不可能的。鲁布林斯基耸耸肩膀，把窗帘放下来，我们半躺着用中文、俄文、越文、法文和英文里能记得的单字，再加手势继续那愉快的谈心。邻近是几位国际委员会的印度朋友，他们也为这种以特殊方式进行的谈话感到开心，嘴角上挂着善意的微笑。其中有一位，我记得是在嘉林飞机场首先见面的，他走过来指着时针，告诉我起飞的时刻。
    突然飞机窗外面好像有一道闪光，鲁布林斯基随口说了两个字：“湄公”。拨开窗帘，确实是闻名已久的湄公河。这时候虽然离得还远，但是已经使人感觉到前面摆着的是一条大河。这一带的山势也急剧地降低，接着是波纹起伏的丘陵地带，然后就是一溜相当开阔的平原。这是湄公河带来的大量的泥沙所造成的一块连接着一块的冲积平原。按照1953年的统计材料，老挝全国共有二百六十多万人，其中很大一部分是住在湄公河沿岸的平原上。全国四十多万公顷的耕地也主要分布在这个地带里。这里土地肥沃，气候条件又好，适宜于各种热带植物的生长，据说稻子一年可以三熟。稻米是老挝人民的主要食粮。种稻面积约占总耕地的80％。
    飞机在低空里滑行，湄公河平原上的景色清晰可见：田野好像是用青色和黄色绒线编织成的一张宽阔的地毯，已经黄透了的地方有人开始在那里收割庄稼；一个个由高脚屋组成的村落隐藏在绿树丛中；几条红色的道路划过田野伸向远方；那边是船影点点的湄公河；河湾处大概是老挝王国首都万象了。金色的高塔，布局别致的建筑物，黑色的柏油路，等等。可是还没来得及看清楚的时候，飞机已经越过了湄公河，在泰国上空稍为盘旋一个小半圈便又转回河东岸来，降落到离万象市中心五公里的“市开”飞机场上。
    鲁布林斯基还要继续他的航程。我们握手道别的时候，只听见他说了声“到了”，的确我已经踏上了老挝的土地。“再会吧朋友，祝你一路平安！”（附图片）
