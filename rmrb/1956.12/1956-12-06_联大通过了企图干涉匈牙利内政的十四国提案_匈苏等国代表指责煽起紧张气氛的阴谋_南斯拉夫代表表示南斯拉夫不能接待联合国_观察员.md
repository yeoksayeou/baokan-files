Xinhua News Agency, December 5th, New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly, after three meetings, adopted on December 4th the fourteen-nation proposal instigated by the United States to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. This proposal requests the Hungarian government to allow the United Nations to send "observers" to Hungary and sets a deadline for the Hungarian government to respond to this issue by December 7th. The proposal also unreasonably demands that UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld make arrangements to send UN "observers" to Hungary's neighboring countries to "investigate" the Hungarian events.

The result of the vote was 54 in favor of the fourteen-nation proposal, 10 against, and 14 abstentions. Among the countries voting in favor were the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Australia, Pakistan, Cuba, and Italy. Those voting against were: Albania, Bulgaria, Byelorussia, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. Abstaining were: Afghanistan, Burma, Ceylon, Egypt, Finland, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Horvath, who attended the General Assembly, announced at the afternoon meeting that he was instructed by the government of the Hungarian People's Republic to be willing to meet with UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld at any time to discuss the date and arrangements for his visit to Budapest. Subsequently, Hammarskjöld held talks with Horvath. Hammarskjöld announced at the beginning of the evening meeting that he might go to Budapest from December 16th to 18th and would send an assistant in the next few days to make arrangements.

However, despite Hammarskjöld's announcement that he would go to Budapest, some countries led by the United States still deliberately insisted on passing the fourteen-nation proposal. US representative Lodge, in his speech, particularly emphasized the issue of sending "observers" to Hungary's neighboring countries. Lodge's speech showed the United States' eagerness to complicate the situation in Hungary and create new incidents.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Horvath spoke against the fourteen-nation proposal. He said, "It is regrettable that some representatives are trying to obstruct the complete consolidation of the situation in Hungary at the General Assembly, thereby artificially inciting tension and threatening world peace."

Horvath said: "I can assure all those who want to establish a government hostile to socialism in our country that their illusions, like a soap bubble, will come to nothing.
These people must understand that the legitimate government of the Hungarian people is the Kadar government, and no matter how much they want it to be replaced with another, it will continue to exist as it is."

Representatives from the Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Byelorussia also spoke against the fourteen-nation proposal. Soviet representative Kuznetzov said that the fourteen-nation proposal was another attempt to grossly interfere in Hungary's internal affairs.

Kuznetzov denounced those who insisted on saying that Hungarians were being "expelled" as rumor-mongers and slanderers. He said that, on the contrary, Hungarian youth in Austria were being fenced in with barbed wire, while their parents were anxiously waiting for them to return home.

Ukrainian representative Sapozhnikov said that the fourteen-nation proposal was intended to "use the Hungarian situation to undermine the Hungarian people's trust in the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government."

Yugoslav representative Ivković expressed disagreement with the part of the fourteen-nation proposal concerning sending UN observers to Hungary's neighboring countries. He said, "Yugoslavia cannot receive such observers, and this proposal will only further complicate the problem," and its result "will not be useful and constructive."

Indian representative Menon said that he "could neither agree nor disagree" with the claim that Hungarians were being expelled, due to a lack of factual evidence. He opposed sending observers to Hungary's neighboring countries, saying that this would create a situation where no country could be spared from being spied upon and would put neutral countries in a difficult position. Menon also expressed opposition to the use of the term "Hungarian authorities" in the fourteen-nation proposal and the provision setting a deadline for the Hungarian government to respond.

However, he also said that he disagreed with the view that the Hungarian issue was purely an internal affair. Menon also said that India had made it clear to the Soviet Union and Hungary that "foreign troops should withdraw from all countries."

Representatives from some countries, including Britain, France, Brazil, Colombia, Pakistan, and Iraq, spoke in support of the fourteen-nation proposal at the General Assembly.

    联大通过了企图干涉匈牙利内政的十四国提案
　　匈苏等国代表指责煽起紧张气氛的阴谋
　　南斯拉夫代表表示南斯拉夫不能接待联合国“观察员”
    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会12月4日经过三次会议后通过了美国所主使的干涉匈牙利内政的十四国提案。这个提案要求匈牙利政府允许联合国派“观察员”去匈牙利，并且限定匈牙利政府在12月7日以前就这个问题提出答复。提案还无理地要求联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德进行安排，把联合国“观察员”派往匈牙利的邻国去“调查”匈牙利事件。
    表决结果，赞成十四国提案的有五十四票，反对的十票，弃权的十四票。在赞成的国家中，包括有美国、英国、法国、加拿大、澳大利亚、巴基斯坦、古巴和意大利等。反对的是：阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、乌克兰、苏联和南斯拉夫。弃权的是：阿富汗、缅甸、锡兰、埃及、芬兰、印度、印度尼西亚、约旦、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、叙利亚、突尼斯和也门。
    出席大会的匈牙利外交部长霍瓦特曾经在下午会议上宣布，他奉匈牙利人民共和国政府之命，愿意随时同联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德会晤，讨论他到布达佩斯访问的日期和安排问题。接着，哈马舍尔德就同霍瓦特举行了会谈。哈马舍尔德在晚间会议一开始就宣布，他可能在12月16日到18日去布达佩斯，并且将在最近几天内派一个助手前去进行安排。
    但是，尽管哈马舍尔德已经宣布将去布达佩斯，以美国为首的一些国家仍然别具用心地坚持要通过十四国提案。美国代表洛奇在发言中特别强调了派“观察员”去匈牙利邻国的问题。洛奇的发言表明美国渴望使匈牙利局势复杂化，并且制造新的事端。
    匈牙利外交部长霍瓦特发言反对十四国提案。他说，“有些代表力图在大会上阻挠匈牙利局面的彻底巩固，从而人为地煽起紧张气氛和威胁世界和平，这是令人遗憾的。”
    霍瓦特说：“我可以向所有那些想在我国建立一个敌视社会主义的政府的人断言，他们的幻想像一个肥皂泡一样，不会有任何结果。
    这些人必须明白，匈牙利人民的合法的政府是卡达尔政府，不管它们多么希望它换成另外一副样子，它还是会照样存在。”
    苏联、乌克兰和白俄罗斯等国家的代表也发言反对十四国提案。苏联代表库兹?佐夫说，十四国提案是又一次企图粗暴地干涉匈牙利内政。
    库兹?佐夫斥责那些硬说匈牙利人被“放逐”的人为谣言贩子和毁谤者。他说，相反的，匈牙利的青年在奥地利被用铁丝网围起来，而他们的父母却在焦心地等着他们回家。
    乌克兰代表萨波日尼科夫说，十四国提案是要“利用匈牙利事态来破坏匈牙利人民对匈牙利工农革命政府的信任”。
    南斯拉夫代表伊维科维奇表示不同意十四国提案中关于派联合国观察员到匈牙利邻国去的那一部分。他说，“南斯拉夫不能接待这样的观察员，这个建议只能使问题进一步复杂化”，它的结果“不会是有用的和建设性的”。
    印度代表梅农说，他“既不能同意也不能反对”关于匈牙利人被放逐的说法，因为缺乏事实证据。他反对派观察员到匈牙利的邻国去，他说，这会造成没有一个国家能够免于被窥探的局面，而且会使中立国家为难。梅农还表示反对十四国提案中使用的“匈牙利当局”的说法和限期要匈牙利政府作出答复的规定。
    不过他又说，他不同意匈牙利问题是纯粹内政问题的说法。梅农还说，印度已经向苏联和匈牙利表明“外国军队应当从一切国家撤退”。
    在大会上发言支持十四国提案的有英国、法国、巴西、哥伦比亚、巴基斯坦、伊拉克等一些国家的代表。
