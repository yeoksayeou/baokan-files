    A Journey on the Yingxia Railway
    (Continued from yesterday)
    By our reporter Shang Kai

    Fifty Years of Wishes Realized

    The car sped along the Zhangzhou-Xiamen highway. Palm trees outside the window flashed backward in a continuous stream. After crossing the Jiangdong Bridge over the Jiulong River, we met the Yingxia Railway again, and at the same time, we saw a discontinuous earth mound not far from the railway, overgrown with reeds, obviously the roadbed of a railway that had long been abandoned.

    "So, there was a railway in Fujian before?" Almost everyone who comes here for the first time asks in unison, as if they have discovered a precious historical relic.

    Mentioning this abandoned roadbed evokes a painful memory for the people of Fujian: as early as fifty years ago, the people of Fujian and overseas Chinese hoped to build a railway in their hometown to develop the resources of Fujian Province and prosper its economy. At that time, the corrupt Qing Dynasty rulers regarded this wish of the people of Fujian as a way to get rich. Under the guise of building the Zhangzhou-Xiamen Railway, in addition to extensively raising funds among overseas Chinese, they also adopted the coercive method of "donating one cent for road construction for every pound of salt purchased" within the province. A total of 2.2 million silver dollars in cash was raised. Starting in 1907, it took a full seven years to barely build a Zhangxia Railway of less than twenty-eight kilometers. Cai Zhuchan, the deputy mayor of Zhangzhou, recalled the situation at the time: "Although this railway was called the Zhangxia Railway, it actually did not cross the sea to the east or the river (Jiulong River) to the west. Passengers traveling from Zhangzhou to Xiamen every day had to walk seventeen kilometers to Jiangdong Bridge to buy tickets and board the train. Sometimes, by the time the passengers arrived, the train had already left. Therefore, there were fewer than forty passengers and no more than two thousand catties of freight per day." After the Xinhai Revolution, the railway was repeatedly taken over by warlords and bureaucrats, and its business became corrupt, with increasing losses, and materials were stolen and sold. When the Kuomintang government took over, not only did it not restore and develop it, but it also transported away the remaining locomotives and rails. Finally, it simply sold the land of Songyu Station to the American Standard Oil Company. From then on, the people of Fujian's hope of building a railway was completely shattered.

    Later, we visited Mr. Lin Rongxiang, who once served as the director of the Zhangxia Railway Bureau. Mr. Lin is a person full of enthusiasm for the construction of the motherland. When the Kuomintang government took over the Zhangxia Railway, he proposed a plan to expand the Zhangxia Railway, that is, to extend the railway from Jiangdong Bridge in Zhangzhou to Longyan, so as to transport grain, timber, paper, coal, and lime from there. However, this plan was kept in the Kuomintang's Ministry of Railways, and no one paid attention to it. After the victory of the national revolution, Lin Rongxiang proposed a proposal to build a railway from Xiamen to the inland at the first People's Congress of Xiamen. He now recalls: "At that time, the proposal was just to express my wishes. Who would have thought that in just a few years, this wish would be realized." Lin Rongxiang's wish is also the wish of the people of Fujian, the wish of overseas Chinese. Therefore, the news that the Yingxia Railway was about to open not only inspired the people of the whole country and Fujian Province, but also made overseas Chinese compatriots rejoice, writing letters, composing poems, sending telegrams, and presenting banners to express their gratitude to the heroes who built the Yingxia Railway. An overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar wrote the following letter of appreciation to the Yingxia Railway construction site:

    "...The news that the Yingxia Railway is about to open has warmed the hearts of overseas Chinese like a spring breeze and encouraged their patriotic enthusiasm. Every overseas Chinese has a deep feeling of infinite gratitude to you because you have built a road to happiness for the people of the motherland and realized the fifty-year-old wish of overseas Chinese to build a railway..."

    This letter is one of the millions of letters sent back by overseas Chinese compatriots, expressing their love for the socialist construction of the motherland.

    Not a Myth, but Reality

    In ancient myths, stories of heroes and warriors moving mountains and filling seas are often mentioned. This was originally a human desire to conquer nature, but in today's New China, it has become a reality - two long dikes spanning the Xiamen Strait have been built. From then on, Xiamen Island, separated by the sea, was closely linked with the mainland of the motherland. Who wouldn't say "This is a miracle on earth!"

    When I was still traveling on the Yingxia Railway, many people who had been to the Xiamen Strait repeatedly instructed us: "When you get to Xiamen, wherever you don't go, you must go and see the seawall." Now, we have ascended to the Guanti Pavilion at the northern end of Xiamen Island, and the situation of the seawall is very clear: it stretches from Xinglin on the west coast of Xiamen Strait, eastward across a bag-shaped bay, to Jimei on the north coast of the strait, and then from Jimei southward across the strait, to Gaoqi at the northern end of Xiamen Island. The two seawalls are five kilometers long and nineteen meters wide, all built of white granite. Looking from afar, they are like two jade belts floating on the blue sea, so magnificent.

    These two closely connected cross-sea dikes were built to allow trains from Yingtan to cross the strait and go directly to the urban area of Xiamen. The entire project mobilized thousands of stonemasons, boatmen, and porters, hundreds of boats and vehicles, dumped millions of cubic meters of stone, and lasted more than a thousand days and nights. The heroes of stone throwing and dike building once sang:

    The wind blows dark clouds all over the sky, the Xiamen Strait is full of waves;
    Seagulls fight the storm, heroic fleets rush the tide;
    The sea breeze is strong, the waves are high.
    The wind whips the face, the waves drench the body;
    Cross the torrents, bypass the reefs, work together to row the oars,
    Break through the wind and waves and move forward, with the ambition to move mountains and fill the sea.

    For three years, the heroes of dike building attacked the mountains and rocks day and night, and fought with the ocean. An artificial "rainbow" finally appeared in the Xiamen Strait.

    Now, everything here is calm, only the rushing waves are impacting the seawall, and the seawall uses its huge body to resist the waves. The story of moving mountains and filling the sea is being circulated like a myth.

    Peaceful City on the Coastal Defense Front - Xiamen

    Xiamen is the end point of the Yingxia Railway. It is located on the front line of the southeast coastal defense of the motherland, separated from Jinmen Island, which is occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's army, by only a strip of water. Here, the rumble of artillery fire can sometimes be heard.

    Before arriving in Xiamen, we imagined it as a city with a very strong atmosphere of war. The citizens probably had to go to air-raid shelters several times a day, and shells might often fall on the streets. In fact, our imagination was completely wrong. In the evening, we arrived at Songyu. Songyu and Xiamen are separated by only a three-kilometer strait. Looking from here, the tall white buildings of Xiamen, under the setting sun, took on a red glow, as charming and beautiful as a young girl. We jumped on a wooden sailboat and slowly sailed towards it. The sea breeze blew in our faces, and our minds felt refreshed. The fatigue brought on by the journey completely disappeared here. The boat approached the pier in the dim night, and at this time, looking at Xiamen again, it had turned into a flower crown with brilliant lights. On Lujiang Road along the coast, cars flowed like water, and pedestrians were bustling. Someone's loudspeaker was broadcasting cheerful and melodious songs - where was there any atmosphere of war, it was completely a scene of peace and prosperity.

    Anyone who comes to Xiamen must visit Gulangyu, which is known as "Sea Park" and "Water Lily." Gulangyu is a small island, hidden inside Xiamen Port. Just from its name and people's praise of it, you can imagine how beautiful it is. The highest point of Gulangyu is the Sunlight Rock on Dragon Head Mountain. Zheng Chenggong, a national hero of the late Ming Dynasty, once trained sailors here. The remains of the water training platform are still preserved on Sunlight Rock. Climbing Sunlight Rock, you can overlook the entire Xiamen Port, with dotted white sails, flat fishing boats, thousands of acres of blue waves, and seascapes like paintings.

    In Xiamen, we strolled through the streets and saw new factories and residences, new hospitals and schools, as well as public recreation and entertainment venues, buildings rising from the ground one after another. Although there were occasional rumbles of artillery fire from the front, people remained calm as usual and continued to work busily. They said: "For several years, we have been building socialism in the sound of artillery fire every day." Yes, although the people of Xiamen are on the front line of national defense, and the struggle against the enemy is very fierce, even as in 1954, they were under alarm and artillery fire day and night. However, they have not slowed down their pace of building socialism. From the day Xiamen was liberated, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, they have been engaged in intense struggles with the enemy in the midst of alarms, while healing the wounds left over from the old society. Judging from the development of local industry, since liberation seven years ago, the city has built, expanded, and renovated many local state-owned and joint state-private factories, including fish liver oil factories, sisal factories, cardboard factories, glass factories, chemical factories, machine factories, leather factories, canning factories, rubber factories, battery factories... At present, there are thirty-two factories in the city with four thousand six hundred employees. The total industrial output value in 1955 increased by 67% compared with 1950. This has gradually transformed Xiamen from a consumer city into a production city.

    The Yingxia Railway is about to open, and the good news has inspired the 200,000 people of Xiamen. At present, they are actively renovating roads, opening up tree-lined avenues, painting houses, planting flowers and trees. The pavilions and buildings in Zhongshan Park and Yanping Park have been painted with a new look... Xiamen has opened her arms and is ready to welcome guests from all over the country. (The End)

    鹰厦铁路纪行
    （续昨）
    本报记者　商恺
    五十年的愿望实现了
    汽车飞驰在漳（州）厦（门）公路上。车窗外的棕榈树一连串的往后面倒去。跳过了九龙江上的江东桥，便又和鹰厦铁路会面了，同时看到在离铁路不远的地方，有一条断断续续的已经长满了茅草的土垅，显然这是一条早已废弃了的铁路路基。
    “原来福建也有铁路吗？”第一次来到这里的人差不多都要同声发问，像是发现了什么珍贵的历史遗迹似的。
    提到这条废弃了的路基，又勾起了福建人民的一件伤心往事：远在五十年前，福建人民和海外华侨，便希望在自己的家乡修建一条铁路，开发福建省的资源，繁荣福建省的经济。当时腐朽的清朝统治者，把福建人民的这个愿望，当作了自己的发财之道。以修筑漳（州）厦（门）铁路相号召，除了在海外华侨中广泛募集外，在省内又采取“购盐一斤，捐路捐一文”的强迫征集办法。共凑集了二百二十万元银元的现款。从1907年起，经过了整整七个年头，才勉强修起了一条不足二十八公里的漳厦铁路。漳州市蔡竹禅副市长回忆当时的情形说：“这条铁路虽然名为漳厦铁路，实际上东不渡海，西不过江（九龙江），每天从漳州去厦门的旅客，要步行到十七公里以外的江东桥去买票上车，有时候等旅客走到了，火车已经开走了。所以每天乘客不满四十人，载货不过两千斤。”辛亥革命以后，这条铁路经军阀官僚反复接管，营业腐败，赔累日甚，物资被盗卖一空。等到由国民党政府接管以后，不但没有恢复和发展，而且把仅剩的机车和钢轨也运走了。最后干脆把嵩屿车站的地皮也出卖给了美国的美孚公司。从此，福建人民修筑铁路的愿望便完全破灭了。
    后来，我们访问了一度担任漳厦铁路局局长的林荣向先生。林先生是一个对祖国建设满怀热情的人，当国民党政府接收漳厦铁路的时候，他曾提出过一个扩建漳厦铁路的计划，即把铁路从漳州江东桥延长到龙岩去，以便把那里的粮食、木材、纸张、煤炭和石灰运出来。但是，这个计划一直被压到国民党的铁道部里，没有人去理它。全国革命胜利以后，林荣向在厦门市第一次人民代表大会上又提出了从厦门往内地修筑铁路的提案。他现在回想说：“当时提出这个提案，不过是想表示自己的愿望罢了，谁想到短短的几年以后，这个愿望就实现了。”林荣向的愿望，也就是福建人民的愿望，海外华侨的愿望。所以，鹰厦铁路快要通车的消息，不但振奋了全国和福建省的人民，海外侨胞也莫不欢欣鼓舞，纷纷写信、吟诗、拍电报、送锦旗，慰问修建鹰厦铁路的英雄们。缅甸的一个华侨商会写给鹰厦铁路工地的一封慰问信里这样说道：
    “……鹰厦铁路快要通车的消息，像春风一样吹暖了侨胞们的心，鼓舞着侨胞的爱国热情，每一个侨胞的内心，都蕴藏着对你们无限感激的深情，因为你们为祖国人民架设了幸福之路，实现了侨胞五十年来修筑铁路的愿望……”。
    这封信是海外侨胞寄回来的千百万封信中的一封，它表达了海外侨胞热爱祖国社会主义建设的心情。
    不是神话，是现实
    在古代的神话里，常常提到英雄勇士移山填海的故事。这本是人类征服自然的愿望，但是，在今天的新中国里，却变成了现实——横贯厦门海峡的两条长堤筑成了。从此为大海隔离着的厦门岛和祖国大陆紧密地联在了一起。谁不说“这是人间的奇迹”。
    当我还旅行在鹰厦路途中的时候，许多到过厦门海峡的人，一再嘱咐我们：“到了厦门，哪里不去，也要去看看海堤。”现在，我们已经登上了厦门岛北端的观堤亭，海堤的形势看得非常清楚：它从厦门海峡西岸的杏林，向东伸过一个袋形海湾，便到了海峡北岸的集美，然后由集美再向南伸过海峡，便到了厦门岛北端的高崎。两条海堤共长五公里，宽十九公尺，全部由白色花岗石筑成。远远望去，像是两条玉带浮在蔚蓝色的海面上，是那样的壮丽。
    这两条紧相衔接的跨海长堤，是为了让从鹰潭开来的火车渡过海峡直接开往厦门市区而修筑的。全部工程共动员了数千石工、船工和搬运工，成百的船只和车辆，抛石几百万方，历时一千多个昼夜。抛石筑堤英雄们曾这样歌唱：
    风吹乌云满天飘，厦门海峡浪滔滔；
    海鸥搏斗大风暴，英雄船队赶浪潮；
    海风急，海浪高。
    狂风脸上刮，海浪身上浇；
    跨横流，绕暗礁，同心协力把橹摇，
    冲破风浪向前进，移山填海志气豪。
    三年以来，筑堤英雄们就是这样日日夜夜地向山岩进攻，和海洋搏斗。一条人造“长虹”，终于出现在厦门海峡上。
    现在，这里一切都平静了，只有奔腾澎湃的海浪冲激着海堤，海堤用它那庞大的身躯抗拒着海浪。移山填海的故事，像神话一样的在传诵着。
    海防前线的和平城市——厦门
    厦门，是鹰厦铁路的终点。它处在祖国东南海防的最前线，同蒋军盘据的金门岛，只有一衣带水之隔。在这里有时候可以听到隆隆的炮声。
    在没到厦门以前，我们把它想像成了一个战争气氛非常浓厚的城市。市民们大概一天要下几次防空壕，说不定大街上还会经常落着炮弹。其实，我们的想像完全错了。傍晚时刻，我们到了嵩屿。嵩屿和厦门仅隔着一个三公里的海峡。从这边望过去，厦门高大的白色建筑物，在夕阳西照之下，泛起了一层红晕，像少女一样妍媚多姿。我们跳上木帆船，向它缓缓驶去。海风迎面吹来，神志顿觉清爽，旅途中所带来的疲劳，到此完全消失了。船在夜色苍茫中靠近了码头，这时候再望厦门，它已经变成了一只灯火灿烂的花冠。沿海的鹭江道上，车如流水，行人熙攘，不知谁家的扩音喇叭，在放送着轻快悦耳的歌曲——这哪里有什么战争气氛，完全是一片和平和繁荣的景象。
    到厦门的人，都要去游览一次被誉为“海上公园”和“出水芙蓉”的鼓浪屿。鼓浪屿是一个小小的海岛，躲在厦门港的里边。仅从它的名字和人们对它的称誉就可想像它是如何的美丽了。鼓浪屿的最高点是龙头山的日光岩。明末民族英  雄郑成功，曾经在这里训练过水兵，现在日光岩上还留有水操台的遗迹。登上日光岩，可以俯览厦门港全景，只见点点白帆，扁扁渔舟，万顷碧波，海山如画。
    在厦门，我们曾漫步街头，只见新的工厂和住宅，新的医院和学校，以及公共游息和娱乐场所，一幢幢的建筑物不断地从平地上升起来。虽然有时候从前沿传来几阵隆隆的炮声，但是人们镇静如常，照样地忙碌着。他们说：“几年以来，我们就是天天在炮声中建设社会主义。”是的，厦门人民虽然处在国防前线，对敌斗争非常激烈，甚至像1954年那样，日日夜夜都处在警报和炮声中。但是，他们并没有放慢了建设社会主义的脚步。他们从厦门解放的那一天起，就在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，在警报声中，一面与敌人进行激烈的斗争，一面医治旧社会所遗留下来的创伤。从地方工业的发展来看，解放七年以来，全市新建扩建和改建了许多地方国营和公私合营工厂，这里边包括鱼肝油厂、龙舌蓝厂、纸板厂、玻璃厂、化工厂、机器厂、制革厂、罐头厂、橡胶厂、电池厂……现在全市共有工厂三十二座，职工四千六百人，1955年工业生产总值比1950年提高了67％。这就使厦门从一个消费城市逐步转变成了一个生产城市。
    鹰厦铁路就要通车了，喜讯传来，鼓舞了厦门市二十万人民。目前他们正在积极地翻修马路，开辟林荫大道，粉刷房舍，栽种花木，中山公园、延平公园里的亭台楼阁，被油漆得焕然一新……厦门市已经张开了她的怀抱，准备迎接来自全国各地的佳宾。　（完）
