    Collaboration Problems Between Party A and Party B During Construction
    Liang Weizhi
    Not long ago, we conducted some investigations into the collaboration problems between Party A and Party B in several key construction cities in the Northeast. Our working method was: after arriving in a certain area, first visit the local Party committee to understand the overall situation, and then talk with the responsible comrades of Party A and Party B separately; finally, organize symposiums for all relevant departments, hoping to absorb opinions from all aspects, both above and below, left and right, through these methods. In terms of investigation content, first, we explored the causes of disputes between Party A and Party B; second, we explored what different opinions there were on collaboration issues; and finally, we learned some experiences on how to improve collaboration. Now, I will summarize these issues into the following points for explanation.

    What Disputes Are There?

    First of all, due to the inconsistent planning calibers of Party A and Party B, contradictions arose in the requirements for project progress. The state requires Party A to complete a certain amount of project volume (expressed in physical terms) in one year, and various projects should be put into production according to plan; while the state requires Party B only to complete a certain amount of work volume (expressed in value) in one year. Therefore, Party A requires Party B to carry out construction evenly according to the importance and urgency of the production sequence; however, due to the limitations of equipment design and other conditions, Party B sometimes has to stop work and wait, and sometimes has to rush to catch up. Moreover, in order to complete the plan ahead of schedule or exceed the quota, Party B often rushes to construct the most valuable projects, often neglecting the final-stage projects. As a result, some individual projects, from the perspective of the plan, have long been completed, but in fact, they cannot be put into production.

    Secondly, contradictions also frequently occur in quality inspection and intermediate acceptance work. Entrusted by the state, Party A is quite strict in its quality inspection of construction projects. However, sometimes Party B is not convinced by the technical requirements put forward by Party A, believing that Party A has no construction experience and does not accept Party A's opinions. Party A sometimes overuses its power to suspend work, causing dissatisfaction among Party B. Party B says that Party A has an authoritative mindset, and Party A says that Party B has a bourgeois management style.

    Thirdly, disputes often occur in financial settlements and construction budgets. The design budget is formulated according to the technical design, but the technical design items are incomplete, and the amount of money calculated according to this is often less than the construction drawings, while the bank only allocates funds according to the design budget. As a result, the construction department cannot complete the cost plan.

    Fourthly, disputes often arise in terms of offering rationalization proposals. Because both Party A and Party B have the task of reducing the total cost of the project, everyone is looking for ways to reduce costs. Sometimes, when Party B puts forward a rationalization proposal to solicit Party A's opinion, Party A says that they have already considered this issue and are preparing to modify the drawings. In order to implement the rationalization proposal, Party B sometimes keeps it secret and does all the preparatory work before suddenly submitting it to Party A, making it too late for Party A to modify the drawings, which to some extent forms intrigue.

    Fifthly, unclear boundaries between materials and equipment can also lead to many disputes. There are many things, such as the steel frame of the crane platform, pipe switches, flange plates, gaskets, screws, and so on. Party A believes that these things are materials and should be purchased by Party B; Party B believes that these things are equipment and should be supplied by Party A, so they shirk their responsibilities and argue endlessly.

    Two Opinions

    Due to the existence of so many problems in the relationship between Party A and Party B, many people have doubts about the system of Party A and Party B. They advocate changing the current system and adopting a large quota system. That is to say: the state hands over the total investment amount for the construction of a certain enterprise to the construction unit, stipulates the completion deadline, and the construction unit is fully responsible, and Party A is only responsible for acceptance upon completion. In addition to the large quota system, some people also propose that Party A simply do only production preparation work, and the quality inspection issue should be the responsibility of the construction unit's competent department. Still others believe that the best way to solve the relationship between Party A and Party B is to implement a general contracting system, where the plan design, equipment, construction conditions, and so on, are all the responsibility of Party B, and Party A is only responsible for quality supervision and production preparation. They said: "Now, in addition to being supervised by Party A, Party B is also supervised by the bank and inspected by state organs. Why should Party B be subject to so much supervision? Why can't it be solely responsible to the state?"

    However, some comrades believe that Party A's supervision should not be abolished; on the contrary, it should be strengthened. As for how to improve collaboration, as long as the local Party committee leads and establishes the unified leadership of the Party, all contradictions can be resolved. Some said: Party A's supervision should not be abolished under any circumstances. If Party A's supervision is abolished, it will revert to the old path of "eating from the same pot," and even settlements will not be possible. Still others believe that the contradiction between Party A and Party B is inevitable. It is a reflection of many objective and complex factors in capital construction. Only by constantly discovering and resolving contradictions can we seek rapid improvement in our work.

    As for my personal opinion, I believe that in the current situation of increasingly expanding construction tasks and increasingly detailed division of labor, it may not be appropriate to abolish Party A's supervision. Because, first, Party A's work is not only about passive supervision; the main thing is about actively guaranteeing and carrying out huge organizational work. After a construction task is determined, before the site selection begins, it is necessary to actively collect various technical and economic data and natural data. Then, a series of surveys, explorations, soil tests, domestic and foreign orders, design review and approval, urban planning, transportation, land use, resident relocation, water and electricity supply, and other issues will follow. Without Party A's huge organizational work, Party B would not be able to carry out construction smoothly. If all the above work is handed over to Party B, it is clear that Party B's existing organizational structure would be unable to handle it. If Party B sets up another such organizational structure, it will revert to the past "one-stop-shop" practice, which will not only create a chaotic situation but also not conform to the spirit of professional division of labor. In particular, Party A completely detaches itself from the construction process, does not understand the equipment performance and installation situation, and will not be able to grasp production after completion and acceptance. Therefore, the method of handing over the design, equipment, plan, and all investment to Party B is unworkable and unrealistic.

    Second, mutual supervision between Party A and Party B will only benefit the work. As for the emergence of contradictions under mutual supervision, it is natural. As long as everyone resolves these contradictions in the spirit of mutual collaboration, it is not terrible. Moreover, even if Party A's supervision is abolished, many contradictions will not disappear. For example, as construction tasks become larger and larger, construction and technical forces are always insufficient. This contradiction cannot be resolved in the short term. If the design and equipment cannot be delivered on time, even without Party A, the contradiction cannot be resolved. In addition, some contradictions or disputes arise because the state's certain rules and regulations are not perfect. Even without Party A, the situation will remain. Therefore, we say that even if Party A's supervision is abolished, it will not eliminate or reduce contradictions; it will only temporarily cover up some contradictions in the absence of Party A's supervision, and some contradictions will become direct dealings between the construction department and the state leadership organs.

    How to Improve Collaboration

    We have learned some experiences in improving collaborative relationships in several key construction areas in the Northeast. Summarized, it can be divided into the following points.

    First, Party A and Party B should clarify their responsibilities and improve their work. From Party A's point of view, its task is not only about passive supervision; the main thing is to actively organize various forces to ensure the completion of the task. Therefore, at the beginning of capital construction work, it should take the initiative to create working conditions for Party B and conscientiously solve difficulties for Party B. Party A should concentrate its efforts on considering the supply of design equipment more, and the supervision and inspection should not be too cumbersome, so as not to tie Party B's hands and feet. In fact, many disputes are caused by some minor interventions. Party A must give Party B full consideration in terms of living welfare and working conditions, and be considerate of the difficulties such as Party B's large mobility and poor living conditions. Some people reflect that Party A's attitude towards Party B is: "Applaud and welcome when they first come, report them to the city in the middle, and drive them out in the end." This attitude will of course make it difficult to improve the relationship between the two parties. Party A should also clearly recognize that Party A should play a leading role in improving the relationship between Party A and Party B. As for Party B, it should mainly establish the viewpoint of "serving production." After a project is completed, it must be able to be put into production. Do not unilaterally consider economic accounting and neglect the final-stage projects, so that some projects are nominally completed but cannot actually be put into production. In the construction process, Party B should also recognize Party A's leading position, discuss matters more, and take the initiative to improve the collaborative relationship.

    Second, establish the unified leadership of the Party on the site, strengthen ideological work within the unified Party organization, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and when encountering disputes, conduct discussions within the Party and then make a decision. Both parties should implement it. This is the key to improving collaboration and cooperation. In the past, many units have adopted systems such as joint Party committee meetings, Party A and Party B construction committees, and factory director and manager meetings in terms of collaboration issues, but they have not achieved much effect because each is its own organization. Although resolutions are made at the meeting, they still go their own way after the meeting.

    The July 1st Factory construction site in Jilin City established a unified on-site Party group under the guidance of the Municipal Party Committee, which played a great role in the issue of collaboration. The members of this Party group include the Party committee secretaries, factory directors, and managers of Party A, Party B, and the major subcontractors. The Party group secretary is appointed by the Municipal Party Committee and is directly responsible to the Municipal Party Committee. The task of the Party group is to supervise the Party group members in implementing the Party's policies and the various laws and regulations stipulated by the state, and implementing the contractual obligations between each other; according to the state plan, supervise the Party group members to correctly compile the comprehensive progress plan, and review and supervise its effective implementation on time; while organizing the realization of the comprehensive progress plan, the Party group stipulates the central projects of collaboration and cooperation, or key work, unify thoughts and actions, and prevent various subjective factors that may hinder the completion of the plan. Since the establishment of the on-site Party group, the collaborative relationship at the July 1st Factory construction site has been greatly improved, disputes between Party A and Party B have been greatly reduced, and even basically eliminated. Even if there are disputes, the Party group makes a decision, which can be smoothly resolved. Now, the Jilin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is promoting this experience.

    Third, in addition to solving organizational problems, it is more important to solve ideological problems in all aspects. In order to enable the cadres of both parties to establish an overall concept and overcome departmentalism, leading cadres are required to take the lead. Problems must be discussed with each other and resolved face to face. When encountering disputes, the leadership must strengthen investigation, find out the situation, and avoid listening to only one side.

    Some Rules and Regulations Should Also Be Appropriately Changed

    In order to improve the collaborative relationship and reduce unnecessary disputes between Party A and Party B in the construction process, the state should also make appropriate improvements to certain rules and regulations based on the development of the situation, which is also an urgent requirement of the current construction department. For example, the state's planning requirements for Party A and Party B are inconsistent, and the statistical requirements are also different. Should they be appropriately unified in the future? For another example, in addition to requiring Party B to complete a certain amount of work, should it also be required to ensure that certain completed projects can be put into production on time within a certain period of time? Some quotas are not complete or accurate enough, and it is required to modify and supplement them in a timely manner below. Furthermore, the following questions are raised: Should the budget still be prepared according to the technical design? Can the plan be considered completed as long as the machine is moved into the factory building? Can the project be handed over to Party A when Party B completes 95% of the workload? How should the settlement method be appropriately and clearly stipulated? These are the questions that the lower levels are eager to solve.

    施工中甲乙方的协作问题
    梁维直
    不久以前，我们在东北的几个重点建设城市，对甲乙方的协作问题，作了一些调查。我们的工作方法是：到达某一地区后，先访问当地党委了解全面情况，然后再同甲乙方负责同志分别进行交谈；最后组织各有关部门的座谈会，希望通过这些方式吸收上下左右各方面的意见。在调查内容上，首先是探讨引起甲乙方纠纷的原因；再是探讨在协作问题上有些什么不同意见；最后了解了怎样来搞好协作的一些经验。现在把这些问题，归纳为以下几点来加以说明。
    有那些纠纷
    首先，由于甲乙方计划口径不一致，在工程进度要求上就发生了矛盾。国家对甲方的要求，是一年要完成多少工程量（用实物表示），各项工程要按计划投入生产；而国家对乙方的要求，则只是一年要完成多少工作量（用价值表示）。因此，甲方就要求乙方能按生产顺序的轻重缓急，均衡地进行施工；而乙方由于设备设计等条件的限制，有时不能不停工窝工，有时又得赶工突击。而且乙方为了提前或超额完成计划，也常常抢最值钱的工程施工，往往忽视了尾期工程。这样，就使得某些单位工程，从计划上看，早已完成了任务，但实际上不能投入生产。
    其次，在质量检查和中间验收工作中也经常发生矛盾。甲方受国家委托，对建设工程的质量检查相当严格。但有时乙方对于甲方提出的技术要求不服气，认为甲方没有施工经验，不接受甲方意见。甲方有时也过多使用了停工权，造成乙方不满。乙方说甲方有权威思想，甲方说乙方有资产阶级经营作风。
    第三，在财务结算和施工预算上也常常发生纠纷。设计预算是按照技术设计制定的，但技术设计项目不全，按这算出来的钱数往往比施工图少，而银行只根据设计预算来拨款。这样，就使得施工部门不能完成成本计划。
    第四，在提合理化建议方面也常引起纠纷。由于甲乙方都有降低工程总造价的任务，大家都在找窍门来降低成本。有时，乙方提出合理化建议，去征求甲方意见，甲方就说这个问题他们早已考虑到，正准备修改图纸。乙方为了实现合理化建议，有时就密而不宣，一切准备工作都做好后，再突然向甲方提出，使甲方来不及修改图纸，这就在某种程度上形成了勾心斗角。
    第五，材料和设备之间的界限划不清，也会形成很多争执。有很多东西，如吊车平台的钢骨架，管道开关器、法蓝盘、垫板、螺丝等等。甲方认为这些东西是材料，应由乙方负责购置；乙方认为这些东西是设备，应由甲方负责供应，于是互相推诿，争论不休。两种意见
    由于甲乙方关系上存在这么许多问题，很多人就对甲乙方这个体制产生怀疑。他们主张改变现在的体制，采取大定额制度。就是说：国家把建设某一企业的总投资额交给施工单位，规定竣工期限，由施工单位全部负责，甲方只负责到期验收就行了。除了大定额制外，还有人提出，甲方干脆就只做生产准备工作，至于质量检查问题，则由建设单位的主管部门负责。还有人认为，解决甲乙方关系的最好形式，是实行总包工制，把计划设计、设备、施工条件等，都交由乙方负责，甲方只负责质量监督和生产准备。他们说：“现在乙方除了受甲方的监督外，还有银行的监督，以及国家机关的检查，乙方为什么要受这样多的监督，为什么不能单独对国家负责呢？”
    但是，也有的同志认为不应取消甲方的监督，相反应加强甲方的监督，至于如何搞好协作，只要在地方党委领导下，建立党的统一领导，一切矛盾就可以解决。有的说：甲方的监督，无论如何不应取消，如果取消了甲方的监督，又会回复到过去“一锅煮”的老路上去，连结算也做不出来。还有的认为：甲乙双方的矛盾是必然的，它是基本建设中许多客观复杂因素的反映，只有不断地发现矛盾，解决矛盾，才能求得工作的迅速改进。
    至于我个人的意见，我认为在目前建设任务日益扩大，分工愈趋细密的情况下，取消甲方的监督不一定恰当。因为，第一，甲方的工作原不只在于消极的监督，主要还在于积极的保证和进行巨大的组织工作。当一个建设任务确定之后，在厂址选择开始之前，要积极搜集各种技术经济资料和自然资料，接着就是一系列的勘测、钻探、土壤化验、国内外订货、设计审查批准、城市规划、交通运输、土地使用、居民迁移、水电供应等等问题，就会接踵而来，没有甲方的巨大的组织工作，乙方是不可能顺利施工的。假使把上述工作全部交给乙方，显然在乙方现有组织机构下，是无法胜任的。假使乙方另设这样一套组织机构，又回复过去的“一揽子”做法，不仅会形成混乱局面，而且也不符合专业分工的精神，尤其是甲方完全脱离了施工过程，对设备性能和安装情况不了解，在交工验收后也无法掌握生产。因此，把设计、设备、计划和全部投资交给乙方的办法是行不通的，也是不现实的。
    第二，甲乙方互相监督，只会对工作有利。至于在互相监督下产生矛盾，是很自然的，只要大家本着相互协作的精神去解决这些矛盾，并不可怕。而且，即或取消了甲方的监督，许多矛盾并不跟着消除。例如建设任务愈来愈大，施工和技术力量总是不足，这个矛盾在短期内是无法解决的。设计、设备不能按时达到，即使没有了甲方，矛盾也无法解决。另外一些矛盾或纠纷的产生，是因为国家某些规章制度不够完备，没有甲方，情况也依然存在。因此，我们说，即或取消了甲方的监督，并不能消灭或减少矛盾，只是某些矛盾在没有甲方监督的情况下得以暂时掩盖起来，有些矛盾则变成由施工部门直接和国家领导机关打交道。
    怎样搞好协作
    我们在东北几个重点建设地区，了解了一些搞好协作关系的经验，归纳起来，可分为以下几点。
    第一，甲乙双方应明确自己的责任，改进自己的工作。从甲方来说，它的任务不仅在于消极的监督，主要的还在积极组织各种力量，保证任务的完成。因此，基本建设工作一开始，就应主动替乙方创造工作条件，认真替乙方解决困难。甲方应集中精力更多地考虑设计设备的供应，监督检查不要过于繁琐，以免束缚乙方的手脚。事实上，很多纠纷都是一些细小干涉引起来的。在生活福利上和工作条件上甲方必须给乙方以充分照顾，体贴乙方流动性较大、生活条件较苦等困难。有人反映：甲方对乙方的态度是：“初来时鼓掌欢迎，中间告状进城，最后赶着出门”。这种态度当然就很难搞好双方关系了。甲方还应该明确认识，搞好甲乙双方关系甲方应起主导作用。至于乙方，主要应该树立“为生产服务”的观点，一个工程交工后，就要能够投入生产，不要片面地去考虑经济核算，忽视尾期工程，使某些工程名义上竣了工，而实际不能进行生产。在施工过程中，乙方也应承认甲方的主导地位，有事多加商量，主动来搞好协作关系。
    第二，建立现场党的统一领导，在统一的党的组织内，加强思想工作，展开批评和自我批评，遇到争执问题，在党内展开讨论，然后作出决定，双方都贯彻执行，这是搞好协作配合的关键。过去很多单位在协作问题上曾采取了党委联席会议、甲乙方建厂委员会、厂长经理碰头会等制度，都没有收到多大效果，原因是各是各的组织，会上虽然作出决议，会后还是各行其是。
    吉林市七一厂工地在市委指导下，建立了统一的现场党组，对协作问题起了很大作用。这个党组的成员包括甲乙方及大二包的党委书记、厂长、经理。党组书记由市委指定甲方党委书记担任，直接对市委负责。党组的任务是监督党组成员贯彻党的方针政策和国家规定的各种法令，实施互相之间的合同义务；根据国家计划，监督党组成员正确地编制综合进度计划，并按时审查监督其切实贯彻执行；在组织实现综合进度计划的同时，党组规定协作配合的中心项目，或关键性的工作，统一思想行动，防止可能发生的各种障碍计划完成的主观因素。从建立现场党组以来，七一厂工地的协作关系，有了很大改进，甲乙双方的纠纷大为减少，甚至基本上消除了纠纷，即或有了争执，党组作出决定，也能顺利解决。现在中共吉林市委正在推广这个经验。
    第三，除解决组织问题之外，更重要的还必须解决各方面的思想问题。为了使双方干部都能树立整体思想，克服本位主义，就要求领导干部首先以身作则。有问题必须互相商量，面对面地解决。遇到有争执的地方，领导上要加强调查，摸清情况，避免偏听偏信。
    有些规章制度也要适当改变
    为了搞好协作关系，减少甲乙方在建设过程中不必要的纠纷，国家对某些规章制度，也应根据情况的发展作适当的改进，这也是目前建设部门的迫切要求。例如国家对甲乙方计划要求不一致，统计要求也不相同，今后是否应适当地统一起来。又例如对乙方除了要求完成多少工作量而外，是否也应该要求在一定时间，保证某些竣工工程能按时投入生产。某些定额不够完备或不够准确，下面要求及时修改和补充。再如下面提出：是否还按技术设计编制预算？机器只要推进了厂房，能不能就算计划上完成了任务？乙方工作量完成95％，可否就向甲方交工？结算办法，应该作如何恰当和明确的规定？这些问题都是下面急于要求解决的。
