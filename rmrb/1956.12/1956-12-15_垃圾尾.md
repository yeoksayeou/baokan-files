Junk Tail

Junk Tail Island is located in the Pearl River Estuary. Ships are engaged in transshipment day and night, the sea breeze is whistling at the masthead, and the sea water is lapping against the sides of the ships. The winch seems like a soprano singer, singing day and night. The whole island is bathed in song, and this song spreads all the way to Hong Kong across the water. Hong Kong's wharves are also noisy day and night, but they cannot compare with this place. What kind of place is it there? What kind of life do people live? In the noise over there, workers finish their work and sleep on the streets, the youth of young girls becomes a commodity, high-rise buildings are suffocating, but ambitious people and hooligans are very proud. These two islands meet every day, the same neighbors with different moods. Our stevedores are working happily, making the people over there envious. During the day, the five-star red flag flutters in the sky, and at night the electric lights emit brilliant light. Junk Tail Island, look how proud it is. The sea breeze is whistling at the masthead, the sea water is lapping against the sides of the ships, and in order to quickly send imported equipment to construction posts, the stevedores are engaged in transshipment day and night.

    垃圾尾垃圾尾小岛在珠江口，轮船在日夜地进行过驳，海风在桅顶上呼啸，海水在船边拍打。温车好像唱高音的歌手，在日夜不停地歌唱。整个小岛都浸浴在歌声里，这歌声一直传扬到对面的香港。香港的码头也在日夜的吵嚷，它却不能和这儿相比，那里是一个什么地方？人们在过着怎样的生活？在那边的吵嚷声里，工人们做完工去睡马路，少女的青春变成商品，高楼大厦压的喘不过气，野心家和流氓却很得意。这两个小岛每天都要见面，一样的邻居两样的心情，我们的装卸工人在愉快地工作，使那边的人们羡慕不已。白天五星红旗临空飘扬，晚上的电灯发出灿烂的光芒，垃圾尾这个小岛，你看它有多么的骄傲。海风在桅顶上呼啸，海水在船边拍打，为着把进口的器材赶快送到建设岗位，装卸工人在日夜地进行过驳。
