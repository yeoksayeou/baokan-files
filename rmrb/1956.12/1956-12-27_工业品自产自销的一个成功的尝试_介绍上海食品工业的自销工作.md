    A Successful Attempt at Self-Production and Self-Sales of Industrial Products
    Introducing Shanghai's Food Industry's Self-Sales Work
    By Our Correspondent Ji Yin
    In Comrade Chen Yun's speech at the Eighth National Congress of the Party, it was proposed that after the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory, some of the measures taken by the state economic departments in the past to restrict capitalist industry and commerce have become unnecessary, and new measures need to be taken to adapt to the needs of economic development. The first of these measures is to change the purchase and sales relationship between industrial and commercial enterprises, and change the method of processing and ordering goods by commercial departments from factories to the method of factories purchasing raw materials and selling goods.
    Implementing self-sales of industrial products is a new change with principled significance in our country's industrial and commercial management work. Why should this measure be proposed in a timely manner at present? Is it feasible to implement self-sales of industrial products in actual work? The Shanghai food industry department has made a preliminary answer to this question. The Shanghai food industry is one of the two industries in Shanghai that is currently conducting self-sales experiments (the other is the brush industry). It began self-sales work in August this year, and the result of self-sales has been successful. The entire industry has turned from general difficulties to improvement, and production has changed from a large backlog to a situation of short supply. The facts of the past five months have proved that after the overall public-private partnership of the entire industry, it is completely beneficial to the development of production for industries like the food industry, which have a wide variety of products and are not necessities of people's lives, to change from purchase and sales to self-production and self-sales.
    Why Implement Self-Sales?
    Before the public-private partnership, the Shanghai food industry had hundreds of large and small factories, most of which were private factories. In the past, the state adopted the method of purchasing and selling products from these factories by state-owned commercial departments. This method played a decisive role in promoting the transformation of this private industry. The Shanghai food industry was filled with a decadent capitalist management style in the past. Products only sought superficial decoration, without regard to quality, and even sold deteriorated candies. Factory sanitary conditions were generally very bad, and the candies produced were very dirty, but the profits were very high. The "big fish eat small fish" style of competition among factories was also very fierce, with large factories growing larger and larger, while a large number of small factories were in difficult situations. After the implementation of purchase and sales, these decadent products of capitalism have been gradually restricted and transformed. The quality of products has been greatly improved under the supervision and assistance of state-owned commercial departments; the situation of products not meeting sanitary conditions has been reduced; due to the unified allocation of raw materials and tasks, the production of large and small factories has been arranged, and high profits have also been restricted. The entire industry has embarked on the path of lower-level state capitalism.
    However, this method of restricting capitalism has also had some side effects that are not conducive to the development of production. First of all, after the implementation of the purchase and sales method, the state-owned wholesale company's top-down distribution of goods replaced the past direct and close connection between factories and sales departments, resulting in the widespread phenomenon of "goods not matching the market." For example, Chen Hexing Candy Factory's Black Tiger brand rolled candies were originally popular in Kaifeng, Luoyang, and other areas, while Dongya Candy Factory's Black Cat brand rolled candies were sold in Xuzhou and other places. After the acquisition, in the large-scale distribution of goods, this original sales network was disrupted. Consumers in these areas often could not buy the candies they originally liked, while others were being stockpiled. This situation of stockpiling on one side and out-of-stock on the other almost always occurred.
    After the purchase and sales, the variety of products was greatly reduced. Because the state-owned wholesale company implements large-scale allocation from top to bottom, the simpler the variety, the more convenient the work. As a result, most of the varieties produced by the candy factories in the past have stopped production, and the focus has been on producing simple "mass-produced goods." The old candy packaging paper stockpiled by various factories alone amounted to 400,000 yuan. The severe reduction in variety caused dissatisfaction among consumers and directly led to a large decline in candy sales.
    Some of the above are side effects of the unified purchase and sales, and some are shortcomings and errors in the work. In short, these negative factors caused the production of the Shanghai food industry to decline abnormally. By the spring of this year, the candy factories in Shanghai generally stopped production and reduced production, and even had to rely on government relief to barely maintain. In April of this year, more than 50,000 yuan was issued for factory shutdown relief funds, and a large number of workers were forced to transfer to other industries. Candy was once stockpiled up to 1.2 million catties. But at this time, some areas wanted to buy Shanghai candy but could not get it. The commercial departments in Shangrao, Jiangxi, had to travel far to Sichuan to purchase biscuits, and Wuhu near Shanghai was also forced to buy candy in Guangzhou.
    In the spring of this year, the Shanghai food industry implemented an industry-wide public-private partnership and established a national unified leadership organization, the Food Industry Company, and the entire industry was incorporated into the socialist track. At that time, the difficulties in production were extremely serious, and there was an urgent need to find a way out. Where is the way out? The leaders of the Industrial Company studied the characteristics of the food industry and believed that the solution was to change the purchase and sales method to self-sales. Because the food industry is a consumer product that is not a necessity of people's lives, the variety is complex, the production variability is large, and the products cannot be stored for a long time. Therefore, production must be determined by sales, and the turnover of production and sales must be fast. These characteristics determine that food production is not suitable for layer-by-layer turnover, but is suitable for direct contact with consumers. A basic shortcoming of the past purchase and sales was that it ignored this characteristic, resulting in a decline in production. After clarifying the future path, the Industrial Company organized a visiting group in April, carrying samples to visit Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other major sales areas of Shanghai food. The grassroots commercial departments in various places were extremely surprised to see the samples brought by the visiting group. They did not know that Shanghai had so many candies, many of which they had always wanted to buy but had never been able to buy. This visit further exposed the seriousness of the past separation of production and sales, and proved that the decision to implement self-sales was correct and feasible.
    How is Self-Sales Implemented?
    The self-sales work of the Shanghai food industry department began partially in August this year and officially started in October. Since then, its relationship with the state-owned commercial wholesale company has changed from the original purchase and sales to partial selective purchase. Specifically, candies and biscuits are completely self-sold, and some miscellaneous foods in the food (such as monosodium glutamate, beef juice, beef jerky, infant cakes, etc.) are selectively purchased. State-owned commercial departments have the right to give priority to selective purchases, and the remaining products are self-sold by industrial departments. Individual commodities (such as milk powder) are still sold because of insufficient supply.
    It is important to introduce that the self-sales work of the Shanghai food industry is not carried out by factory enterprises independently, but under the leadership of professional companies, specialized institutions are organized to uniformly manage self-sales. This specialized institution is called the Manager Department of the Food Industry Company. It is a common sales department of various factories and is responsible for all business related to self-sales. The Manager Department is jointly composed of personnel drawn from various factories.
    The Manager Department is a place for direct contact between all factories and units requiring goods. Now purchasing agents from commercial departments in various places no longer need to obtain distribution of goods from state-owned wholesale companies as in the past, but directly run to the Manager Department. There is a sample room here, displaying all the varieties produced. After you select it, if the quantity of goods required is very large, you will sign a contract, and the Manager Department will be responsible for shipping it in full at the specified time. If it is some grassroots cooperatives and shops that require a small quantity of goods, there is a retail and wholesale group in the Manager Department, where you can buy the food you have selected at any time.
    Now the production of various food factories is carried out in a planned manner under the leadership of the professional company and the Manager Department. The Manager Department sends the order plans from various places to the planning department of the Industrial Company to prepare a production plan and organize factory production. When factories have new problems in production, they can report to the Manager Department for resolution at any time, and when the Manager Department encounters certain new situations, it can also contact the factory at any time for resolution. The relationship between the Manager Department and the factory is much more flexible than the relationship between the state-owned commercial department and the factory in the past.
    Regularly listening to the opinions of consumers and sales departments is an important task of the Manager Department. Now the Manager Department regularly holds symposiums for business people in wholesale stores and retail stores to listen to their opinions, and then convey them to various factories. The Manager Department also directly controls four stores, such as Guanshengyuan, as key points, where it plans to listen to and study consumer feedback. These four stores are also used to trial-sell new products.
    From the above aspects, it can be seen that the biggest feature of implementing self-sales is that the producer and the seller have changed from the past separation of production and sales to meeting each other, and some of the shortcomings that occurred during the unified purchase and sales in the past can be fundamentally eliminated.
    Why does self-sales work adopt unified operation of the entire industry, instead of letting factories conduct self-sales independently? Will this affect the production enthusiasm of factories? This is a question worth studying. Judging from the preliminary results of the self-sales work of the Shanghai food industry, the practice of implementing unified operation is appropriate, because the number of food factories in Shanghai is large, the size disparity is large, and the conditions for self-sales in each factory are different. If each factory conducts self-sales, the large factories will inevitably take precedence and the small factories will suffer, forming new competition. Simultaneous self-sales by many factories will also result in a great waste of manpower and materials. It is also extremely inconvenient for units requiring goods, because the varieties required by units requiring goods always hope to be more, and it is difficult to be satisfied in one factory, so it is necessary to run to many factories. Implementing unified operation of self-sales can concentrate manpower, arrange uniformly, and facilitate leadership. This is generally welcomed by factories, and units requiring goods find it more convenient.
    What Changes Has Self-Sales Brought to Production?
    The implementation of self-sales of industrial products has brought another profound change to the Shanghai food industry since liberation. This change is reflected in: the original production characteristics of each factory have been restored, the old purchase and sales relationships of each factory that were disrupted in the past have been re-established, the high-end candies of the Talmon Candy Factory have reappeared in the North China market, the milk and toffee of the Gan's Candy Factory have restored their sales in Shanxi, and the White Dove brand candies of the Lian'an Factory have regained popularity in the west of the Longhai Railway... Products that had no sales during the past sales system have opened up sales channels, and 20 varieties that had stopped production in the past have resumed production and become hot-selling goods. The market for Shanghai food industrial products has expanded.
    After the implementation of self-sales, the manufacture of new products has been encouraged. In five months, factories have added a total of 42 new varieties.
    After the implementation of self-sales, factories are more concerned about the quality of products than in the past. In the past, quality was inspected by commercial departments, and factories held a "get through" attitude. Now the factory is responsible for the quality itself. If the sales unit finds that the product has deteriorated, the factory will be responsible for returning and exchanging it. Factories have established their own technical inspection organizations, and go deep into the production process to conduct inspections. If unqualified semi-finished products are found, they are eliminated midway. In the past, the quality inspection of the commercial department was carried out after the product was delivered from the factory. When problems were found, a large number of products had been manufactured, often causing great waste. This loss can now be avoided.
    In the past five months, due to the development of self-sales work, accompanied by the active market in the second half of the year, the Shanghai food industry has completely changed the situation of general losses and semi-shutdown in the first and second quarters of this year. Since August, sales have increased month by month. Taking the main products of the food industry, candies and biscuits, as examples, according to incomplete statistics: in August of this year, candies were 1.44 million catties, and in October they rose to more than 2.93 million catties. Biscuits were more than 1.49 million catties in August, and rose to more than 1.82 million catties in October.
    After the full self-sales began in October, sales volume increased even more sharply, resulting in a situation of short supply. Lian'an Factory had insufficient production in the first quarter of this year, relying on relief to maintain, and lost thousands of yuan, while in October it had a surplus of about 1,800 yuan.
    The entire process of implementing self-sales in the Shanghai food industry is smooth, but some new problems have also emerged at present, such as insufficient production capacity after the market suddenly expands, and a series of new tasks (such as transportation, warehousing, etc.) need to be established after the implementation of self-sales. These problems are being studied and resolved.

    工业品自产自销的一个成功的尝试
    介绍上海食品工业的自销工作
    本报记者　季音
    陈云同志在党的“八大”发言中提出了在资本主义工商业的社会主义改造取得决定性胜利以后，过去国家经济部门为限制资本主义工商业所采取的一些措施已经成为不必要了，而需要采取一些新的措施来适应经济发展的需要，其中第一个措施就是要改变工商企业之间的购销关系，把商业部门对工厂所实行的加工订货办法，改为由工厂购进原料、销售商品的办法。
    实行工业品自销，这是我国工商业管理工作中一个新的具有原则意义的变化。为什么要在目前及时地提出这个措施？实行工业品的自销，在实际工作中是否行得通？这个问题，上海食品工业部门已经作出了初步的解答。上海食品工业是上海目前进行自销试验工作的两个行业之一（另一个是毛刷业），从今年8月份开始，它就开始了自销工作，自销的结果是成功的，整个行业由普遍困难走向好转，生产由大量积压变为供不应求。五个月来的事实证明了，在全行业公私合营以后，像食品工业这种品种繁多而又非人民生活必需品的行业，由收购包销改为自产自销，对发展生产是完全有利的。
    为什么要实行自销？
    上海的食品工业在公私合营以前有几百个大小工厂，其中绝大多数是私营工厂。过去国家对这些工厂的产品采取了由国营商业部门收购包销的办法，这个办法，对促进这个私营工业的改造起了决定性的作用。上海的食品工业过去是充满了腐朽的资本主义经营作风的，产品只求表面的装璜，不问质量，甚至连变质的糖果也出卖。工厂卫生条件普遍很坏，生产的糖果很不干净，而利润却很高。工厂之间“大鱼吃小鱼”式的竞争倾轧也非常剧烈，大厂愈滚愈大，而大量的小厂则处境困难。在实行了收购包销之后，这些资本主义的腐朽产物便逐步地受到了限制和改造，产品的质量在国营商业部门的监督和协助下大有改善；产品不合乎卫生条件的情况减少了；由于统一分配原料和任务，大小工厂的生产都有了安排，高额利润也受到限制。整个行业走上了低级形式的国家资本主义的道路。
    但是这个限制资本主义的办法也起了一些不利于生产发展的副作用。首先是实行了收购包销办法以后，国营批发公司自上而下的派货，代替了过去工厂与销售部门之间直接的密切联系，结果普遍发生了“货不对路”现象。例如陈合兴糖果厂的黑虎牌卷糖原来畅销开封、洛阳一带，东亚糖厂的黑猫牌卷糖则销徐州等地。在收购后，在大批的派货中，这种原有的销售网被打乱了，这些地区的消费者时常买不到原来喜爱的糖果，而另一些地区却在积压着。这种一面积压、一面脱销的情况几乎经常发生。
    收购包销后，产品的花色品种大为减少。因为国营批发公司是实行上下的大批调拨，必然是品种愈简单工作愈方便，结果各糖果厂过去生产的品种，大部分都停止了生产，而集中生产品种简单的“大路货”。各厂仅积压的旧糖果包装纸就达四十万元。品种严重减少，引起了消费者的不满，并且直接使糖果的销售量大为下降。
    以上这些，有的是属于统购包销中的副作用的，有的则是工作中的缺点和错误，总之，这些消极因素使上海的食品工业生产普遍发生了不正常的下降。到今年春天，上海各糖果厂普遍停产减产，甚至要依靠政府救济才能勉强维持，今年4月，工厂停工救济费就发了五万多元，大批工人被迫调到别的行业去工作，糖果一度积压达一百二十万斤。但就在这时候，有的地区却想买上海的糖果而不可得，江西上饶的商业部门只好远奔四川去采办饼干，上海附近的芜湖也被迫到广州去买糖果。
    今年春天，上海食品工业实行了全行业的公私合营，并成立了国家的统一领导机构食品工业公司，整个行业纳入了社会主义轨道。当时生产的困难正异常严重，迫切地要求找出一条出路。出路在哪里呢？工业公司领导上研究了食品工业的特点，认为解决的出路就是将收购包销办法改为自销。因为食品工业是一种非人民生活必需品的消费性商品，品种繁杂，生产变动性大，产品不能长期储藏，因此必须以销定产，产销周转要快。这些特点，决定了食品生产不宜于层层周转，而适宜于和消费者直接见面。过去收购包销时的一个基本缺点，就在于忽略了这个特点，结果造成了生产的下降。明确了今后的出路以后，工业公司又在4月间组织了一个访问团，携带样品，到上海食品的主要销售地区北京、天津、山东、安徽、江苏、浙江、江西等地去访问，各地基层商业部门看到访问团带来的样品，都异常惊喜，他们过去不知道上海有这么多糖果，其中有许多是他们过去一直想买而未曾买到的。这次访问进一步暴露了过去产销不见面的严重性，证明了实行自销的决定是正确可行的。
    是怎样实行自销的？
    上海食品工业部门的自销工作从今年8月起部分开始，10月份起正式展开，从此它与国营商业批发公司的关系，由原来的收购包销，而改为部分选购。具体说就是：糖果、饼干完全实行自销，食品中的一部分杂品（如味精、牛肉汁、牛肉干、乳儿糕等等）则实行选购，这些商品国营商业部门有权优先选购，选购以后还有剩余的则由工业部门自销。个别商品（如奶粉）因供应不足，仍实行包销。
    需要特别介绍的是，上海食品工业自销工作不是由工厂企业单独地进行自销，而是在专业公司的领导之下，组织专门机构来统一地经营自销的。这个专门机构叫做食品工业公司经理部，它是各厂的一个共同的销售部门，负责全部有关自销的业务工作。经理部是抽调各厂的人员共同组成的。
    经理部是代表所有工厂与要货单位直接见面的场所，现在各地商业部门的采购员不必再像过去那样从国营批发公司去取得派货，而是直接跑到经理部来。这里设有一个样品间，陈列着生产的全部品种，你选定以后，如果要货数量很大，就签订一个合同，到了规定的时候经理部就负责如数发运过去。如果是一些要货数量不大的基层合作社和商店，经理部里有一个零售批发组，可以随时去那里买到你所选定的食品。
    现在各食品厂的生产是在专业公司和经理部的领导下，有计划地进行的，经理部把各地的要货计划送到工业公司计划科编制生产计划，组织工厂生产。工厂在生产中有些什么新问题时，可以随时反映到经理部解决，而经理部发生某些新情况时，也可以随时与工厂联系解决。经理部与工厂之间的关系较之过去国营商业部门与工厂的关系，那是灵活得多了。
    经常倾听消费者与销售部门的意见，是经理部的一项重要任务。现在经理部定期召开批发商店、零售店的营业员座谈会，听取他们的意见，然后转告各工厂。经理部还直接掌握了冠生园等四个门市部作为重点，在这里有计划地听取和研究消费者的反映。这四个门市部同时也用来试销新产品。
    从以上几方面可以看出，实行自销的一个最大特点就是生产者与销售者之间，已由过去的产销不见面而变为产销见面，过去统购包销时所发生的一些缺点已可以从根本上得到消除。
    为什么自销工作要采取全行业的统一经营，而不让工厂单独地进行自销呢？这样是不是会影响了工厂的生产积极性？这是一个值得研究的问题。从上海食品工业自销工作的初步结果看，实行统一经营的做法是适当的，因为上海食品工厂数量大，大小悬殊，各厂实行自销的条件不同，如果各厂自销就必然是大厂占先而小厂吃亏，形成新的竞争。许多厂的同时自销也会形成莫大的人力物力的浪费。对要货单位来说也极不便利，因为要货单位需要的品种总希望多一些，很难在一个厂里得到满足，这样势必要跑许多厂。实行统一经营的自销，就可以集中人力，统一安排，便于领导。这样做，工厂里一般都是欢迎的，要货单位更感到便利。
    自销给生产带来了什么变化？
    实行工业品自销的办法，给上海食品工业带来了解放以来又一次深刻的变化。这种变化表现在：各厂原有的生产特点恢复了，过去被打乱了的各厂的旧的购销关系又接上了头，台尔蒙糖果厂的高级糖果又在华北市场上出现，干士糖果厂的牛乳与太妃糖恢复了在山西的销路，联安厂的白鸽牌糖果重新在陇海路西畅销起来……。过去包销时无销路的产品打开了销路，有二十种过去停止生产的品种恢复了生产，并且成为热销货。上海食品工业品的市场扩大了。
    实行自销以后，新产品的制造得到了鼓励，五个月中，各厂共计增加了四十二种新品种。
    实行自销后，工厂对产品的质量比过去关心了。过去质量是由商业部门检验，工厂抱着“过关”的态度。现在质量由工厂自己负责，销售单位如发现产品变质就要工厂包退包换。工厂都已建立了自己的技术检验组织，深入到生产过程中进行检查，发现不合格的半制品，就中途剔出。过去商业部门的质量检验是在出厂以后进行的，发现问题时产品已大批制成，常造成很大的浪费，这种损失，现在已可能避免。
    五个月来由于自销工作的开展，伴随着下半年市场的活跃，上海食品工业完全改变了今年一、二季度普遍亏损和半停顿的状况，从8月份起，销售数逐月上升。以食品工业中的主要产品糖果和饼干为例，据不完全的统计：今年8月份，糖果是一百四十四万市斤，10月份上升为二百九十三万余市斤。饼干8月份是一百四十九万余市斤，10月份上升为一百八十二万余市斤。
    从10月份开始全面自销后，销售量更加激增，以致出现了供不应求的情况。联安厂在今年一季度生产不足，依靠救济维持，亏损了数千元，而10月份已盈余了一千八百元左右。
    上海食品工业实行自销的整个过程是顺利的，但目前也出现了一些新的问题，如市场突然扩大后生产能力不足，实行自销后一系列新工作（如运输、仓库等）要建立等等，这些问题他们都正在研究和解决中。
