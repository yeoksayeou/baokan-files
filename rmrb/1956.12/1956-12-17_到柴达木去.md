Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 14th: More than 110 accounting and planning statisticians departed from Xining on the 11th to work in the Qaidam Basin. They are graduates of the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau training class. These young men and women all expressed their confidence in overcoming difficulties and doing a good job after going to the Qaidam Basin.

After the Qinghai Petroleum Exploration Bureau training class was established in June of this year, this group of young people came here from Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places to study. Some of them are junior high school graduates, and some are demobilized soldiers and veterans. There are now more than 300 students from Hunan who are diligently studying basic knowledge of geological collection, material supply, planning statistics, nursing, and other specialties in the training class.

    到柴达木去
    新华社西宁14日电　一百一十多名财务会计和计划统计人员，11日由西宁出发去柴达木盆地工作，他们是刚在青海石油勘探局训练班毕业的学生。这些年轻小伙子和姑娘们，都满怀信心地表示到柴达木去以后要克服困难，搞好工作。
    今年6月间，青海石油勘探局训练班成立以后，这批年轻人先后由广州、汕头等地来到这里学习。他们有的是初中毕业生，有的是转业军人和复员军人。现在还有三百多名从湖南来的学生，正在训练班努力学习地质采集、器材供应、计划统计、护士等专业基本知识。
