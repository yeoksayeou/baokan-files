The Ou River Hydrological Survey Team, jointly formed by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Water Resources and the Shanghai Hydroelectric Power Survey and Design Institute, has obtained preliminary data on the hydropower resources of the Ou River basin. The Ou River, which flows through eleven counties in southern Zhejiang, is approximately 300 kilometers long, with a basin area of 14,700 square kilometers. The basin receives abundant rainfall, averaging around 1,700 millimeters annually, with an average flow rate of approximately 538 cubic meters per second. Coupled with the river's significant drop in elevation, with gradients (riverbed slopes) of 1.3 to 2.5 per thousand for both the main stream and tributaries, the hydropower resources are abundant. According to rough estimates based on the above data, the Ou River possesses a potential hydroelectric generating capacity of approximately 520,000 kilowatts, equivalent to over 700,000 horsepower, making it suitable for the construction of large-scale hydroelectric power stations.

While investigating hydropower resources, the survey team identified five dam sites on the main stream of the Ou River and seven dam sites on various tributaries. The soil quality in these areas is relatively good, and the general width of the valleys does not exceed 150 to 200 meters, making it possible to construct high dams of 60 to 100 meters.

Once the hydropower resources of the Ou River are developed, they can not only be used for power generation but also can be considered in conjunction with solving downstream irrigation and navigation issues.

    瓯江水力资源十分丰富
    本报讯　由浙江省水利厅和上海水力发电勘测设计院共同组成瓯江、飞云江水利普查队，已经掌握了瓯江流域水力资源的初步材料；流经浙南十一个县的瓯江，全长约三百公里，流域面积共一万四千七百平方公里；流域内的雨量丰富，每年的平均雨量在一千七百公厘上下，每年的平均流量约五百三十八秒公方；加上河流落差大，干流和支流的比降（就是河床的纵坡）都在千分之一点三到二点五之间，蕴藏的水力资源十分丰富。根据以上材料粗略估计，瓯江蕴藏的水力发电量约为五十二万瓩，相当于七十多万马力，可以建造大型水力发电站。
    普查队队员在调查水力资源的同时，在瓯江干流上找到了五个坝址，在各支流上找到了七个坝址。这些地区的土质较好，一般口宽都不超过一百五十公尺到二百公尺，有可能建筑六十公尺到一百公尺的高坝。
    瓯江水力资源开发后，不仅可以用来发电，还可以考虑结合解决下游的灌溉和航运等问题。
