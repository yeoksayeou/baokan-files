　　Resisting Drought and Watering Wheat is a Matter of Utmost Urgency

    Recently, a drought has occurred in the Henan area. The soil moisture of tens of millions of mu of wheat in the province is insufficient, which has greatly affected growth. On November 28, Henan Daily published an editorial entitled "Resisting Drought and Watering Wheat is a Matter of Utmost Urgency," calling on all parts of the province to vigorously launch a winter watering campaign to combat drought and irrigate wheat.

    The editorial stated: Winter watering of wheat is not only very effective for the growth of drought-affected wheat, but also promotes the growth of wheat seedlings and reduces insect pests even for wheat that is not drought-affected. However, at present, some cadres and masses in some areas lack vigilance about the developing drought situation, and their understanding of the importance of winter watering of wheat to resist drought is insufficient. Some cadres see many difficulties, dislike the trouble of winter watering, and are not actively organizing the masses to irrigate wheat. Cadres and masses in some areas lack a summary of the benefits of winter watering of wheat in the past, and still doubt whether winter watering of wheat can increase production. In newly developed irrigation areas, the masses are not yet accustomed to watering wheat. This makes it impossible to quickly and effectively carry out winter watering of wheat in these areas. The editorial went on to say that this year, the work of fighting drought and winter watering wheat has more favorable conditions than any other year. From last winter to this spring, farmers throughout the province have built a large number of small-scale water conservancy projects, and the area of irrigated land has expanded significantly. The province currently has water sources to irrigate nearly 40 million mu of land. In the autumn, combined with wheat planting, nearly 20 million mu of land have been leveled and ridges have been formed in various places, which is conducive to irrigation. Over the past year, the province has trained more than 20,000 farmer water conservancy technicians who can teach and master wheat watering techniques. The example of increased production from nearly 20 million mu of winter-watered wheat last year is also an encouragement to the masses.

    The editorial stated: There are also difficulties in the winter watering of wheat. Although there are more than 1.6 million new and old wells in the province and some ponds, weirs, and canal projects available for use, there is still a great shortage of water lifting tools. Some wheat fields have not been ridged or dug with furrow ditches, and many water conservancy projects damaged during the flood season have yet to be repaired. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate practical winter wheat watering plans based on the distribution of water sources, water lifting tools, water conservancy projects, and the manpower and material resources of agricultural cooperatives, and to organize all forces to overcome these difficulties. The province's plan to supply 150,000 waterwheels this winter must be well completed. Existing water lifting tools should be fully utilized. Measures such as people resting, animals resting, water lifting tools not resting, and the moving and reasonable allocation of water lifting tools should be adopted to maximize the use of water lifting tools. It is also necessary to summarize and promote winter wheat watering techniques according to local conditions based on different water sources, different terrains, and different irrigation and cultivation habits.

### 在地方报纸上　抗旱浇麦，刻不容缓

　　在地方报纸上
　　抗旱浇麦，刻不容缓
    最近，河南地区发生了旱象，全省数千万亩小麦底墒不足，生长受到很大影响。河南日报在11月28日以“抗旱浇麦，刻不容缓”为题，发表社论，号召全省各地大力开展抗旱冬浇小麦运动。
    社论说：冬浇小麦，不仅对于受旱的小麦的生长有很大作用，而且对于不旱的小麦，也有促进麦苗生长和减轻虫害的作用。但是，目前部分地区的干部和群众对于正在发展的旱情缺乏警惕，对于抗旱冬浇小麦的重要性还认识不足。有些干部看困难多，嫌冬浇麻烦，不积极组织群众灌溉小麦。有些地区的干部和群众对过去冬浇小麦好处缺乏总结，对冬浇小麦能否增产还有怀疑。在新发展的灌区，群众浇麦还不习惯。这就使得这些地区内的冬浇小麦工作不能迅速、有力地开展。社论接着说，今年开展抗旱冬浇小麦工作，较任何一年都有其有利条件。去冬今春，全省农民大量举办了小型水利工程，水浇地面积扩大了很多，全省现有水源可浇地近四千万亩；秋天，结合种麦，各地平地整畦近两千万亩，利于灌溉；一年来，全省训练了两万余名农民水利技术员，能够传授、掌握浇麦技术，去年冬浇小麦近二千万亩的增产实例，也是对群众的一个鼓励。
    社论说：在冬浇小麦工作中也不是没有困难的。全省虽然有新旧井一百六十余万眼和一些塘、堰、渠道工程可供利用，但是，提水工具还很缺乏，一些麦田没有扒畦、修挖垅沟，不少在汛期被破坏的水利工程尚待修复。因此，必须根据水源、提水工具、水利工程分布和农业社的人力、物力情况，制定切实可行的冬浇小麦计划，组织各方面力量克服这些困难。今冬全省供应水车十五万部的计划要很好地完成。原有提水工具应充分利用，要采取人歇、畜歇、提水工具不歇和提水工具搬家、合理分配等办法，把提水工具最高限度地加以利用。还必须根据不同水源、不同地形、不同的灌溉和耕作习惯，因地制宜地总结和推广冬浇小麦的技术。
