　　Urumqi, December 1st (From our newspaper) – The Urumqi-Korla Highway in Xinjiang is about to begin construction. The Uku Highway is currently a shortcut connecting the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. It starts from Urumqi, passes through Baiyanggou, crosses the Bingdaban, goes through the Tianshan Mountains, and ends in Korla. It is 343 kilometers long, which is more than 130 kilometers shorter than the current Southern Xinjiang Highway from Urumqi via Yanqi to Korla. This highway was built and opened to traffic by the Xinjiang Military Region in 1952, but was later destroyed by mountain floods and transportation was interrupted. The reconstruction of this highway is of great significance for connecting the exchange of materials between the north and south of Xinjiang, supporting industrial and agricultural construction, and for the production troops to develop the Kaidu River Basin and build large-scale hydropower stations. This highway will be jointly built by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and a mechanical company of the Railway Corps. Before the start of construction, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Production and Construction Corps, the Highway Bureau, and the construction units have jointly formed a survey team, which has conducted surveys along the north and south lines and selected new routes.

　  乌库公路即将修建
    本报乌鲁木齐1日电　新疆乌鲁木齐—库尔勒公路，即将动工修建。乌库公路是目前沟通天山南北的一条捷径，起于乌鲁木齐市，经白杨沟，翻越冰达板，穿过天山，止于库尔勒，全长三百四十三公里，比目前由乌鲁木齐绕道焉耆至库尔勒的南疆公路要缩短一百三十多公里的里程。这条公路曾于1952年由新疆军区修建通车，后来被山洪冲毁，运输中断。这条公路的复建，对勾通南北疆物资交流、支援工农业建设和为生产部队开发开都河流域及兴建大型水电站，都有重大的意义。这条公路将由新疆生产建设兵团和铁道兵某部机械连共同修建。在动工前，新疆维吾尔自治区、生产兵团、公路局和施工单位已经联合组成勘察组，分南北两路沿线进行了勘察，选择了新的路线。
