Title: The upper beam is not straight, the lower beams are crooked.

The prices of scrap metal operated by the Yong'an, Minzhu and other four second-hand goods markets in Wuhan have risen shockingly in the past six months. In February and March, scrap iron bars sold for 200-300 yuan per ton, rising to 800 yuan in June, and as high as 1,200 yuan in September. Old iron plates used to sell for 300-400 yuan per ton, 700-800 yuan in June, and now they sell for 2,300 yuan, more than double the price of new steel.

Why are scrap metal prices allowed to skyrocket without any management? It turns out that the upper beam is not straight, and the lower beams are crooked. The Waste Products Management Department of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, which is responsible for "transforming" these second-hand goods markets, is heavily engaged in this kind of speculative business.

Consider this: How does the Waste Products Management Department operate these scrap metals? In June of this year, they transferred more than 100 tons of old iron plates from the Municipal Metallurgical Bureau in the name of "national recycling" at a price of 180 yuan per ton, and transferred them to the market at a price of 600 yuan. The purchase price of old steel rails was 130 yuan per ton, and the transfer price was 1,600 yuan. The price is the same when selling directly to production units.

Not only that, but they also want to monopolize the market and implement exclusive purchases to ensure excess profits. If a production unit purchases directly, the Waste Products Management Department will come out to block it, slap on a hat of "disrupting the market", and snatch the supply away. In April of this year, the Municipal Third Construction Company sold a batch of old iron wire to a production unit for 200 yuan per ton. When the Waste Products Management Department found out, it immediately bought it at 300 yuan per ton. For several years, the Municipal Third Small Metal Production Cooperative has purchased scrap iron sheets from the Petroleum Company. In September, the Waste Products Management Department discovered this source of supply and proposed to the Petroleum Company to purchase it, and requested the Petroleum Company to lower the selling price (from the original 1,600 yuan per ton to 1,300 yuan) in the name of taking care of the production cooperative. The Petroleum Company agreed. However, the day after the Waste Products Management Department seized this batch of goods, it sold it to the Third Small Metal Production Cooperative at a high price of 2,200 yuan per ton. When the production cooperative questioned it, they put on a monopolistic posture and said, "Don't buy it if you don't want to, you may not be able to buy it later!" The handicraft cooperative had to buy two tons with pain.

This chaotic phenomenon has already had a very bad impact on production: some handicraft production cooperatives have reduced production because the price of raw materials has skyrocketed and the price of finished products cannot be increased; on the other hand, the reduction of handicraft products has directly affected the peak season supply to the rural market.

We appeal: This speculative behavior must be stopped immediately!

　　上梁不正下梁歪
　　张景浩　包采贤
    武汉市永安、民主等四个旧货市场所经营的废旧金属，半年来价格上涨的惊人，二、三月间旧元条铁卖二、三百元一吨，六月间上涨到八百元，九月份竟涨到一千二百元；旧铁板以前三、四百元一吨，六月份卖七、八百元，现在已卖到二千三百元，超过新钢材的价格一倍以上。
    为什么废旧金属的价格任其暴涨，而无人管理呢？原来是上梁不正下梁歪。负责“改造”这些旧货市场的市供销合作社废品经理部正在大作这种投机买卖。
    请看：废品经理部是如何经营这些废旧金属的？今年六月间，他们以“国家回收”名义向市冶金局调入一百多吨旧铁板，每吨价一百八十元，调出给市场的价就是六百元；调进旧钢轨每吨一百三十元，调出是一千六百元。直接卖给生产单位也是这种价格。
    不仅如此，他们还要垄断市场，实行独家收购，以保证超额利润。如果有生产单位直接收购，废品经理部就出来拦阻，扣上一顶“扰乱市场”的帽子，把货源抢走。今年四月，市第三工程公司卖给某生产单位一批旧铁丝，每吨二百元，废品经理部知道了，马上以三百元一吨抢购。市第三细小金属生产社几年来都向石油公司购进废铁皮，九月间，废品经理部发现了这处货源，就向石油公司提出由他收购，并且以照顾生产社为名，要求石油公司降低售价（由原来每吨一千六百元降为一千三百元），石油公司答应了。但废品经理部抓到这批货的第二天，就以每吨二千二百元的高价卖给第三细小金属生产社。生产社提出质问时，他们摆出一付垄断者的姿态说：“你不要拉倒，迟了恐怕还买不到！”手工业社只好忍痛买了二吨。
    这种混乱现象已经给生产带来很坏的影响：一些手工业生产社因为原料价格暴涨，成品不能涨价而减产；另方面，由于手工业产品减少，已经直接影响了对农村市场的旺季供应。
    我们呼吁：必须立即制止这种投机行为！
