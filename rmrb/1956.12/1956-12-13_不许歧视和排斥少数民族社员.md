No Discrimination or Rejection of Minority Nationalities Among Commune Members
　　　　Lu Xindi　Liao Zugui

　　When Henan Province was conducting a general inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies, it discovered that in some individual areas, some Han Chinese Party members and cadres discriminated against and excluded minority nationality masses during the agricultural collectivization movement. Some cooperatives refused to admit Hui farmers; some cooperatives paid Han and Hui members differently for the same work; some cooperatives excluded Hui members from participating in the leadership of the cooperative; and some cadres even limited Hui members from becoming cadres of the cooperative. For example, Gongqiao Township in the suburbs of Xinyang City is a mixed Hui-Han township. The Hui people in this township actively requested to join the cooperative, but the township Party branch did not approve it. It was only after party rectification that the Hui people were reluctantly admitted. As another example, when the Liqiao Township advanced cooperative in Xin County held a meeting to elect the head of the cooperative, Wen Zhixiu (Han Chinese), the secretary of the township's CCP branch, personally controlled the process. This cooperative had a total of nine committee members. Hui committee member Yao Jingxuan received six votes and should have been elected as the head of the cooperative, but Wen Zhixiu stubbornly disagreed. As a result, a Han committee member who only received three votes was elected as the head of the cooperative. Furthermore, in the Hui-Han joint cooperatives in Chenqiao Township of Fengqiu and Jinpo Township of Yu County, small livestock, broken farm tools, distant land, and barren land were allocated to Hui members when distributing draught animals, farm tools, and land. As another example, in the Huangliancheng Township agricultural cooperative in Linying County, two sixty-year-old Han members each earned nine points a day just for delivering bricks when digging a well, while a Hui member who operated the waterwheel only earned seven points a day. However, a Han member who operated the same waterwheel earned twelve points.

　　Although the above examples are only individual phenomena, their nature is very serious. Our Party has always advocated equality among all nationalities, opposed discrimination and oppression between nationalities, and prohibited actions that undermine the unity of all nationalities. These grassroots cadres disregard the Party's ethnic policies and have adopted a discriminatory and exclusionary attitude towards minority nationalities, which is extremely wrong and will affect the unity between nationalities.

　　It is conceivable that in areas where nationalities live in mixed communities, the collectivization movement cannot develop healthily if minority nationality farmers are not mobilized to participate. At the same time, in ethnic joint cooperatives, it is impossible to fully consider ethnic characteristics and give full play to the production enthusiasm of minority nationality members if there are no cadres from the minority nationality who understand the characteristics, the hardships of life, and the demands of the minority nationality to participate in the leadership work.

　　Although the above situation was discovered during an inspection in Henan Province, and the relevant authorities in Henan Province have already taken measures to correct these errors, similar problems exist to varying degrees in other areas where nationalities live in mixed communities. Therefore, we suggest that the Party and government leading organs and relevant departments in areas where nationalities live in mixed communities should regularly and promptly check the implementation of ethnic policies and widely educate grassroots cadres, Party members, and the people about ethnic policies.

    不许歧视和排斥少数民族社员
    陆新地　廖祖桂
    河南省在普遍检查民族政策执行情况的时候，发现个别地区有些汉族党员、干部在农业合作化运动中歧视和排斥少数民族群众，有的合作社拒绝吸收回族农民入社；有的合作社汉族和回族社员同工不同酬；有的合作社排斥回族社员参加社的领导工作；甚至有的建社干部限制回族社员当社的干部。例如，信阳市郊区巩桥乡是一个回汉杂居的乡，这个乡的回民积极要求入社，乡的党支部不批准，经过整党才勉强吸收回民入了社。又如，新县李桥乡高级社开会选举社长时，该乡中共党支部书记闻芝秀（汉族）亲自掌握。这个社共有九个社委，回族社委姚敬宣得六票，应当当选为社长，可是闻芝秀硬不同意，结果一个只得三票的汉族社委当选为社长。又如，封丘陈桥乡和禹县金坡乡的回汉民族联合社，在调配耕畜、农具和土地的时候，把小牲口、坏农具、远地和贫瘠地分配给回族社员。又如，临颍县黄连城乡农业社在打井时，两个六十岁的汉族社员，一天光送砖各得九分，一个回族社员绞水车，一天反而只得七分，而同样绞水车的一个汉族社员却得十二分。
    以上这些事例虽然只是个别的现象，但它的性质却是十分严重的。我们党一贯主张各民族一律平等，反对民族间的歧视和压迫，禁止破坏各民族团结的行为。这些基层干部却漠视党的民族政策，对少数民族采取了歧视、排斥的态度，这是极端错误的，这会影响民族间的团结。
    可以设想，在民族杂居地区，如果不发动少数民族农民参加合作化运动，那里的合作化运动是不能够得到健康发展的。同时，在民族联合社里，如果没有能够了解少数民族的特点、生活疾苦和要求的本民族的干部参加领导工作，也不可能充分照顾民族特点，发挥少数民族社员的生产积极性。
    上述情况虽然是从河南检查出来的，而且河南省的有关机关已经采取措施，纠正了这些错误；但是类似的问题在其他民族杂居地区也或多或少地存在着。因此，我们建议各民族杂居地区的党政领导机关和有关部门，有必要经常地及时地检查民族政策的执行情况，对基层干部、党员和人民群众广泛地进行民族政策的教育。
