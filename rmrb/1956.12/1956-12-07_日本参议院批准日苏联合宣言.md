　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 5th: The Japanese Senate plenary session approved the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration this afternoon. The House of Representatives had already approved this joint declaration on November 27th. Thus, the Japanese Diet has completed the approval procedures for the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration.
    The Senate passed the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration by an overwhelming majority of two hundred and twenty-four votes to three. Simultaneously approved by the Japanese Diet with the Joint Declaration were the Japan-Soviet Protocol on the Development of Trade and Mutual Granting of Most-Favored-Nation Treatment, the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, and the Japan-Soviet Maritime Rescue Agreement.
    Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin recently informed Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama that the Soviet government is making efforts to ensure that the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration is approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in a timely manner. According to a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman today, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu may exchange instruments of ratification with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Fedrin, who is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on December 9.
    After the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration is approved and takes effect, the state of war between Japan and the Soviet Union, which has been delayed for eleven years, will be declared over, and normal diplomatic relations will be formally restored.

    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁最近已经通知日本首相鸠山一郎，苏联政府正在努力使日苏联合宣言及时得到苏联最高苏维埃主席团的批准。据日本外务省发言人今天透露，日本外务相重光葵可能同将在12月9日到达东京的苏联外交部副部长费德林互换批准书。
    在日苏联合宣言被批准生效以后，日苏两国之间拖延了十一年的战争状态宣告结束，正常邦交正式恢复。
