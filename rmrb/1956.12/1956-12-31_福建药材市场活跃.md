    Active Fujian Medicinal Materials Market

    (Our report) Since some areas in Fujian opened up the rural free market, the medicinal materials market has become active. Medicinal materials such as safflower, raw rehmannia root, and prepared rehmannia root, which originally could not be transferred in from other provinces, are now available on the market. In Xiamen, the shortage of medicinal materials such as Cortex Mori has been resolved as over 500 catties have been transported in from neighboring counties for traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. In the past, when various places purchased medicinal materials, it was rare to find medicinal farmers, but now medicinal farmers are actively signing contracts with local medicinal materials companies, and the purchase volume has greatly increased. For example, the total value of medicinal materials purchased in Yunxiao County was previously only 860 yuan per month at most. After the market opened, the total purchase value in September reached 1,912 yuan, and in October it reached 4,008 yuan. (Ren Changyi)

    福建药材市场活跃
    本报讯　福建的部分地区开放农村自由市场以后，药材市场呈现活跃。原来自省外调不进的红花、生地、熟地等药材，现在市场上已经有货了。厦门市脱销的双白皮等药材，已由邻县运进五百多斤，中医配方得到解决。各地过去收购药材的时候，很少找得到药农，现在药农主动地找当地药材公司签订合同，收购量大大增加。如云霄县收购药材总值，从前每月最多只有八百六十多元，开放市场后的9月份收购总值达一千九百一十二元，10月份又达四千零八元。（任昌义）
