　　Some Opinions on Apple Purchasing Work
　　The apple production in southern Liaoning accounts for more than 80% of China's total output and bears the major task of China's apple exports. Apple income accounts for a considerable proportion of the local national economic income.

　　In recent years, many agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms have reported that there are many abnormal phenomena in the apple purchasing work. Therefore, our station and the Finance and Trade Department of the Gaiping County Party Committee recently jointly invited some production cooperatives, state-owned farms, and fruit purchasing stations near Xiong Yue to discuss their opinions on the purchasing work. These opinions are as follows:

　　1. The purchasing specifications are too strict and too high, often controlling apples that could have been sold abroad as substandard and unable to be transported out of the area. This not only affects the income increase of more than 90% of the members, but more importantly, it makes it difficult for people in other places to eat apples, causing excessive consumption in the producing areas, and even waste or excessive inflow into wineries.

　　2. Some regulations on purchasing specifications are inappropriate. For example, the specifications require that the stem rust of first-class apples is limited to the inside of the stem depression. We ask, does stem rust on the outside of the apple affect its edible value? No, it doesn't. Stem rust is often a physiological characteristic of certain varieties, so this regulation is inappropriate; another example is that first-class apples are not allowed to have leaf marks (that is, during the young fruit period, a yellowish-brown symptom is formed on the fruit surface due to friction with the leaves, in fact, it does not affect the appearance or damage the quality). In addition, the purchasing units require that the shape and color of first and second-class apples must be normal, otherwise they will be purchased at a lower price after being downgraded. This requirement has an insurmountable contradiction with the fruit purchasing station's regulations on purchasing too early.

　　3. The fruit purchasing station selects many first and second-class apples that meet export standards from the third and fourth-class apples purchased, which is obviously a way of suppressing the grades. (Editor's note: Judging from the samples sent to the editorial department by the experimental station, the fruit purchasing station does indeed have a suspicion of being picky about stem rust and leaf marks that do not affect the quality of the apples.)

　　4. Purchasing standard specifications should be formulated separately according to the characteristics of the varieties. For example, there are differences in the diameter size requirements between Red Banana and Late Shabao, because Red Banana fruits are large and Late Shabao fruits are small. If the diameter of Red Banana fruits is 35-40 mm, the fruits do not have the excellent flavor that the variety should have, but the purchasing department also sells such apples abroad.

　　5. The purchasing period is too early, which has a great impact on the production unit's output and fruit quality. For example, Red Jade and Wojiin apples start to be harvested on September 1st, which is still one month away from the maturity period. According to experience, these two types of apples have the best flavor and strong storage capacity when harvested on October 16th. The purchasing station starts to harvest Xiaoguoguang apples on November 1st, but in fact, it is best to harvest on November 4th. Of course, in order to avoid wind damage and ground loss, the production department can appropriately pick them in advance according to the weather forecast.

　　6. The fruit purchasing station cannot grasp the standard purchasing specifications, and sometimes the standards are high and sometimes low, and there is a phenomenon of being tight first and then loose. For example, when purchasing Red Jade, Wojiin, and Red Banana apples, the standards are very strict, but when purchasing Guoguang apples, they are slightly relaxed, and at the end of the purchasing period, because there are fewer apples, they are even more relaxed. This approach is inappropriate.

　　Although some of the above-mentioned problems in apple purchasing have attracted the attention of the Gaiping County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and some improvements have been made, this problem has not been reasonably resolved. It is hoped that it will be valued by the higher-level leading departments, otherwise it will bring unfavorable factors to the development of the fruit tree industry. (Editor's note: The editorial department has contacted the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and they will be responsible for studying and solving some problems in apple purchasing.)

### 对苹果收购工作的一些意见

　　对苹果收购工作的一些意见
    辽宁南部苹果产量占我国总产量的80％以上，担负着我国苹果出口的重大任务，苹果收入在当地国民经济总收入中占相当大的比重。
    近年来，不少农业生产合作社和国营农场反映，在收购苹果工作中存在着许多不正常的现象，因此我站同盖平县委财贸部在最近联合邀请了熊岳附近的一些生产合作社，国营农场和水果采购站等单位座谈对收购工作的意见。这些意见如下：
    一、收购规格过严过高，往往把一些本来可以外销的苹果控制在等外，不能外运，这不仅影响了90％以上的社员增加收入，尤其重要的是使外地不易吃到苹果，使产地过多的消耗，甚至造成浪费或过多的流入造酒厂。
    二、在收购规格上有的规定不妥当。如规格要求一等苹果梗锈只限梗凹内部，试问梗锈在苹果外部是否会影响到食用价值呢？不会的。梗锈常是某些品种的生理特征，所以这种规定是不适当的；又如一等苹果不允许有叶磨（就是在幼果期，果面上因被叶子磨擦了一下而后期形成了一种黄褐色的征状，其实，它既不影响外观，亦无损于品质）。另外，收购单位要求一、二等的苹果的果形、色泽必须正常，否则降级低价收购，这个要求是同水果采购站规定的收购期过早有着不可克服的矛盾。
    三、水果采购站从收购的三、四等苹果中挑选出很多合乎出口标准的一、二等苹果，这显然是一种压等的作法。（编者按：从试验站寄给编辑部的样品中看，水果采购站对不影响苹果质量的梗锈和叶磨确实有挑剔的嫌疑。）
    四、收购标准规格，应根据品种特性分别制定。如在直径大小要求上红香蕉和晚沙布有区别，因红香蕉果实大，晚沙布果实小，假若红香蕉果实直径在35—40公厘，果实根本没有具备品种应有的优良风味，但收购部门也把这样的苹果销售到国外去了。
    五、收购期过早，这对生产单位的产量和果品质量有极大影响。如红玉、倭锦两种苹果在9月1日就开始收，距成熟期尚有一个月的时间，根据经验，这两种苹果以10月16日收获，风味最佳，贮藏力也强。收购站在11月1日就开始收小国光苹果，实际上以11月4日收获为最好。当然，为了避免风害落地损失，生产部门可以根据气象预报适当提前采摘。
    六、水果采购站对收购标准规格掌握不住，有时高时低和先紧后松的现象。如在收红玉、倭锦、红香蕉苹果的时候就很严格，在收国光苹果的时候就稍放宽了一些，到了收购末期，因为苹果少了，更加放宽。这种作法是不合适的。
    上述收购苹果中的一些问题，虽已引起中共盖平县委的重视，并有了一些改进，但是这个问题并没有合理地解决，希望能得到上级领导部门的重视，否则会给果树事业的发展带来不利的因素。（编者按：编辑部已经同中华全国供销合作总社取得联系，关于苹果收购工作中的一些问题，将由他们负责研究解决。）
