Should Japonica Rice Be Promoted in Shaanxi?
By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo

This year, Shaanxi Province promoted 1 million *jin* of japonica rice seeds. Chang'an County promoted the most, with more than half of the county's paddy fields (about 30,000 *mu*) planted with japonica rice; followed by Zhouzhi and Nanzheng counties. Other counties planted from several hundred to several thousand *mu*. The results of the promotion showed both increased and decreased yields. It is estimated that among the more than 70,000 *mu* of japonica rice in the Guanzhong area, 60% experienced increased yields, 10% decreased yields, and 30% remained the same. In Shangluo Prefecture and Yan'an, Huangling, and other counties in northern Shaanxi, the trial planting of japonica rice generally increased yields. Chang'an County achieved the best results, with an average yield of 650 *jin* per *mu* on its 31,000 *mu* of japonica rice, 22.5% higher than the local rice yield in 1955 and 19.1% higher than the average indica rice yield this year. The county also saw more than 100 *mu* of high-yielding fields producing over 1,000 *jin*, with the highest yield reaching over 1,400 *jin* per *mu*. Yield reductions were more severe in the southern Shaanxi region. In Ankang Prefecture, among the more than 13,000 *mu* of japonica rice promoted, 30% saw reduced yields, 30% saw increased yields, and 40% remained the same. The most serious case was Hanzhong Prefecture. This prefecture planted a total of 50,000 *mu* of japonica rice this year, with widespread yield reductions. According to a survey by the Hanzhong Prefectural Commissioner's Office in 24 agricultural cooperatives in Nanzheng and Baocheng counties, 21 cooperatives experienced reduced yields, while 3 cooperatives saw increased yields, with a total reduction of more than 2.8 million *jin*.

In areas with reduced yields, the masses' emotions were agitated, complaining about the rural workers and that japonica rice was not a good variety; some were even unwilling to keep japonica rice seeds, saying, "We will never plant japonica rice again." Rural workers in these areas were also ideologically confused; some dared not face the masses, and some agricultural technology extension station personnel even dared not wear their agricultural technology extension station badges. If this confused thinking is not clarified, it will have an adverse impact on next year's production.

What are the reasons for the yield reductions? Is japonica rice not a good variety? Is this type of rice not adapted to the natural conditions of Shaanxi Province? Neither is true. Because the promotion resulted in both yield reductions and increases; some areas with increased yields also saw reductions, while areas with reduced yields also saw increases. For example, in Nanzheng County, which experienced severe yield reductions, some cooperatives saw large harvests of japonica rice. The Baihua Cooperative cultivated more than 16 *mu* of japonica rice, with an average yield of over 947 *jin* per *mu*, and the highest yield reaching over 1,177 *jin* per *mu*. Therefore, the claim that "japonica rice is not a good variety and is not suitable for local natural conditions" is unfounded.

Then, where does the problem lie? According to the investigation materials from various areas with reduced yields, the main reason for the yield reductions is the failure to provide technical guidance based on the characteristics of japonica rice. The characteristics of japonica rice are that it is suitable for high-density planting, cold-resistant, fertilizer-tolerant, has a short maturity period, and requires meticulous cultivation techniques. Therefore, planting japonica rice requires more fertilizer, and the transplanting, inter-tilling, and fertilization operations must be timely. However, the technical measures of many cooperatives did not meet these requirements. Most still used clear-water seedling raising, insufficient density, and insufficient and untimely fertilization.

Taking Nanzheng County, which experienced the most severe yield reductions, as an example. The United, Xingguang, and other three agricultural cooperatives in this county had a total of more than 530 *mu* of japonica rice, but only about 25% were densely planted. These three cooperatives all used clear-water seedling raising methods, resulting in weak seedlings with few tillers, insufficient base fertilizer, and untimely topdressing. In addition, most of them prolonged the transplanting period, which further severely affected the yield of japonica rice. When inspecting the causes of japonica rice yield reductions in Ankang, Guanzhong, and other regions, it was generally found that the cultivation techniques were neglected, the density requirements were not met, transplanting was delayed, and fertilizer was insufficient, etc.

Facts have proven that japonica rice can generally increase yields in areas where cultivation techniques are emphasized. For example, Chang'an County, which saw a relatively large increase in yield, widely publicized the characteristics of japonica rice after accepting the task of promoting 210,000 *jin* of japonica rice seeds and also held technical training classes on japonica rice cultivation. In the areas where japonica rice was promoted, the slogan "Every plot must have base fertilizer, and no clear-water seedlings should be transplanted" was put forward. When raising seedlings, transplanting, and applying topdressing, county, district, and township cadres organized working groups to conduct in-depth technical guidance, resulting in an overall increase in yield.

Based on the above situation, it can be affirmed that the policy of changing indica rice to japonica rice in Shaanxi Province is correct. In the past, Shaanxi generally planted indica rice, which is prone to lodging and shattering, seriously affecting yield improvement. Changing indica rice to japonica rice should be said to be a major measure for increasing rice production in Shaanxi. However, when the broad masses are not yet familiar with the cultivation techniques of this variety, one should not be too hasty. The main problem this year is that the agricultural department's leadership was too eager in requiring the change from indica rice to japonica rice. Before this year, Shaanxi Province had only tried planting japonica rice on a small area of land in a few areas. The general farmers were not familiar with the characteristics of japonica rice, and this year, one million *jin* of japonica rice seeds were promoted all at once. Coupled with the lack of attention to technical guidance by leaders at all levels, many places experienced yield reductions.

What to do next year? Since the policy of changing to japonica rice is correct, it should be adhered to. As long as the broad masses of rural workers and cooperative members correctly summarize and learn from the experiences and lessons in promoting japonica rice, and earnestly rely on the masses to improve cultivation techniques, the work of promoting japonica rice can achieve greater results.

### 陕西究竟该不该推广粳稻

    陕西究竟该不该推广粳稻
    本报记者　朱波
    今年，陕西省推广了一百万斤粳稻种籽。长安县推广的最多，全县半数以上的稻田（约三万多亩）种植了粳稻；其次是盩厔和南郑县。其它各县都种了几百亩到几千亩。推广的结果，有增产的，也有减产的。据估计，关中地区七万多亩粳稻，增产的占60％，减产的10％，不增不减的占30％。商?专区和陕北延安，黄陵等县试种的粳稻普遍增产了。长安的成绩最好，全县三万一千多亩粳稻，平均每亩收获六百五十斤，比1955年当地水稻产量高出22.5％，比今年籼稻平均产量高出19.1％。该县还出现了一百多亩千斤以上的丰产田，最高的亩产一千四百多斤。陕南地区减产较严重。安康专区共推广了一万三千多亩粳稻，减产的占30％，增产的占30％，不增不减的占40％。最严重的是汉中专区。这个专区今年共种了五万亩粳稻，普遍减产。据汉中专署在南郑，褒城两县二十四个农业社调查，粳稻减产的有二十一个社，增产的有三个社。共减产二百八十多万斤。
    减了产的地区，群众情绪动荡，抱怨农村工作人员，抱怨粳稻不是良种，有的甚至连粳稻种子都不愿意留，说“再也不种粳稻了”。这些地区的农村工作人员，思想也很混乱，有的人不敢同群众见面，有些农业技术推广站的人员甚至不敢戴农业技术推广站的证章。这种混乱思想如不加以澄清，对来年的生产将会发生不良的影响。
    减产的原因是什么呢？粳稻不是良种吗？这种水稻不适应陕西地区的自然条件吗？都不是。因为，推广的结果有减产的，也有增产的；在增产的地区有减产的，而在减产地区也有增产的。如严重减产的南郑县，有些社却出现了粳稻大丰收的事例。这个县的百花社栽培了十六亩多粳稻，平均亩产九百四十七斤以上，最高的亩产一千一百七十七斤以上。可见“粳稻不是优良品种，不适合当地自然条件”的说法是没有根据的。
    那末，问题在哪里呢？根据各减产区的调查材料来看，减产的主要原因是没有根据粳稻的特性来进行技术指导。粳稻的特性是适宜高度密植，耐寒，耐肥，成熟期短，栽培技术要求细致等。因此，种植粳稻需要肥料多，插秧、中耕、施肥等作务也要及时。但是，许多社的技术措施没有达到这些要求。大部分还是清水育秧，密植不够，施肥少、质量不好而又不及时。
    仍以减产最严重的南郑县为例。这个县的联合、星光等三个农业社，共有五百三十多亩粳稻，密植的只有25％左右，这三个社都是采用清水育秧的方法，秧苗很弱，分蘖很少，底肥不足，追肥不及时；加以大部分都拖长了插秧期，就更加严重地影响了粳稻的产量。安康、关中等地区检查粳稻减产的原因，一般也是忽视了栽培技术，没有达到密植要求，插秧晚，以及肥料不足，等等。
    事实证明：粳稻在注意栽培技术的地方一般都能够增产。如增产较多的长安县，在接受推广二十一万斤粳稻的任务以后，就多方面宣传了粳稻的特点，并开办了栽培粳稻技术训练班。在推广粳稻的地区，提出“块块有底肥，不插白水秧”的口号，在育苗、插秧、施追肥的时候，县、区、乡干部组织了工作组，深入进行技术指导，结果才获得了全面增产。
    根据以上情况，可以肯定地说，陕西地区改籼稻为粳稻的方针是正确的。过去陕西普遍种植的是籼稻，这种稻容易倒伏和落粒，严重影响着产量的提高。改籼稻为粳稻，应该说是陕西水稻增产的一大措施。但是，当广大群众还不熟悉这种品种的栽培技术的时候，是不可操之过急的。今年的问题，主要就在于农业厅领导方面对籼稻改粳稻的要求过急了些。今年以前，陕西省只在少数地区小面积土地上试种过粳稻，一般农民对粳稻特性还不熟悉，今年一下子就推广了一百万斤粳稻种籽，再加上各级领导对技术指导注意不够，就有许多地方减产了。
    明年怎么办？改种粳稻的方针既是正确的，就该坚持下去。只要让广大农村工作人员和社员群众以正确态度来总结和吸取推广粳稻中的经验和教训，切实依靠群众改进耕作技术，推广粳稻的工作就能得到更大的成绩。
