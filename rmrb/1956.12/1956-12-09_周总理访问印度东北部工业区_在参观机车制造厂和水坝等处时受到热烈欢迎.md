Xinhua News Agency, Sindri, December 8th: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long and their party arrived at Asansol Airport from Madras on the morning of December 7th. They were warmly welcomed by approximately 10,000 people.

Xinhua News Agency, Sindri, December 8th: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long visited two large industrial projects and a water gate built by India after independence in the industrial area northeast of Calcutta on December 7th.

Premier Zhou Enlai and his party first visited the locomotive factory in Chittaranjan. This factory is the largest locomotive factory in the East. The original target was to produce eight locomotives per month, but it can now produce fourteen locomotives per month.

The city and factory were decorated like a festival with flags,彩球 and arches. Workers' families and children came to the streets to welcome the guests, constantly emitting enthusiastic cheers. The Chinese guests toured the factory in jeeps, stopping at a workshop to watch the work of装车轮. There, huge overhead cranes were slowly lowering the boilers already mounted on the undercarriage onto the wheels on the ground. Then, the Chinese guests' jeeps drove past two newly painted locomotives, with smoke billowing from the locomotives' chimneys. Workers standing on the boilers, unfinished engines, and other high places waved and cheered at the guests. Premier Zhou Enlai greeted them with clasped hands in the Indian style, returning their greetings.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long laid wreaths at the bust of the great Indian patriot Chittaranjan. The locomotive factory is named after this patriot. Kanail Singh, General Manager of the Chittaranjan Locomotive Factory, presented Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long with two miniature locomotive models.

Chittaranjan was a wilderness seven years ago. Today, it has become a city of 40,000 people with schools, hospitals, recreational facilities, swimming pools, and other social welfare facilities. More than 7,000 people work in the locomotive factory. Workers' housing occupies a large area and is one of the best workers' housing areas in India. Here, a worker's family can get a separate brick house with a garden around it, with at least two rooms and a kitchen. The rent is only six or seven rupees.

From there, Premier Zhou Enlai and his party traveled by car to the Maithon Dam. This dam, across the Barakar River, is more than 160 feet high and more than 16,000 feet long. It is basically completed, and final finishing work is currently underway. The dam is being equipped with generators to produce 60,000 kilowatts of electricity. Hundreds of workers who built the dam gathered at the construction site to welcome the Chinese Premier. They raised the Chinese five-star red flag and the Indian tricolor flag on the tall cranes at the dam.

Premier Zhou Enlai met the American engineer Savage at the dam. Premier Zhou invited him to China to provide advice on China's water conservancy project plans.

The Chinese guests also visited the Sindri Fertilizer Factory. This factory went into production in October 1951 and now produces 1,000 tons of fertilizer per day, which can meet one-quarter of India's agricultural needs. The factory has spacious workshops and a huge power station. The factory management presented many bags of sulfate fertilizer to the Chinese guests.

The Chinese guests received a very warm welcome while visiting this industrial area. On their sixty-mile journey by car from Chittaranjan to Sindri, hundreds of thousands of people stood by the roadside, waving flags, applauding, and cheering to welcome them. As the motorcade passed through the coal mining cities of Dhanbad and Jharia and nearby suburbs at dusk, banners with welcome slogans were hung on the brightly lit arches along the way. It took two hours for the cars to pass through dozens of welcome arches. In some places, thousands of people gathered near the arches, shouting friendly slogans and throwing flowers at every passing car. The center of Sindri was illuminated like daylight by colored lights decorating the streets, arches, and squares. The streets were crowded with welcoming crowds, as if the entire city's residents had come to the streets to welcome them.

　　周总理访问印度东北部工业区
　　在参观机车制造厂和水坝等处时受到热烈欢迎
    据新华社辛德利8日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理一行7日早上从马德拉斯到达阿散索尔机场。他们受到了大约有一万人的热烈欢迎。
    新华社辛德利8日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理12月7日在加尔各答东北的工业地区参观了印度在独立以后建造的两项巨大的工业工程和一座水闸。
    周恩来总理等一行首先访问了奇塔兰詹地方的机车制造厂。这座工厂是东方最大的机车制造厂，原来的指标是每月制造八台，现在每月可以制造十四台机车。
    这个城市和工厂里都像节日一样用旗帜、彩球和拱门装饰了起来。到街头来欢迎客人的工人家属和儿童不断发出热烈的欢呼。中国客人们乘着吉普车在工厂里参观，他们在一个车间停下来观看了装车轮的工作。那里，巨大的桥式起重机正在把已经装在底架上的锅炉慢慢放到地上的车轮上。然后，中国客人们的吉普车又从两辆新油漆好的机车旁边开过，机车的烟囱喷着烟。站在锅炉上，还没造好的引擎上和其他高处的工人们向客人们挥手欢呼。周恩来总理用印度的方式向他们合掌致意，表示答礼。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理向印度伟大爱国者奇塔兰詹的半身胸像献了花圈。机车制造厂就是以这位爱国者的名字命名的。奇塔兰詹机车制造厂总经理卡奈尔·辛格送给周恩来总理贺龙副总理两个小型机车模型。
    奇塔兰詹在七年以前还是一片荒野，今天已经成为拥有学校、医院、娱乐场所、游泳池和其他社会福利设施的四万人口的城市。在机车制造厂里工作的有七千多人。工人住宅占据了很大的面积，是印度最好的工人住宅区之一。这里，一个工人家庭可以得到单独一幢砖房，周围是花园，每幢至少有两间房间和一间厨房。房租只要六七个卢比。
    周恩来总理一行从那里坐汽车出发到达迈顿水坝。这座横隔在巴拉卡河上的高达一百六十多英尺、长达一万六千多英尺的水坝，已经基本落成，目前在进行最后的修整工作。水坝正在装设生产六万瓩电力的发电机。几百名修建水坝的工人集合在工地，欢迎中国总理。他们在水坝上的高大的起重机上升起了中国的五星红旗和印度的三色国旗。
    周恩来总理在水坝上会见了美国工程师萨凡奇。周总理邀请他到中国去对中国的水利工程计划提供意见。
    中国客人们还参观了辛德利的化学肥料工厂。这个工厂是在1951年10月投入生产的，现在每天生产一千吨肥料，可以满足印度农业的四分之一的需要。这个工厂有宽大的车间和巨大的发电站。工厂的管理当局把许多包硫酸盐肥料赠送给中国客人们。
    中国客人们在参观这一工业地区的时候，受到了非常热烈的欢迎。在他们坐汽车从奇塔兰詹到辛德利的六十英里的途中，有几十万人站在路旁，摇旗鼓掌欢呼，对他们表示欢迎。当这一队汽车在黄昏驶过煤矿区城市丹巴德和贾里厄以及附近郊区的时候，沿途灯光灿烂的拱门上挂着写有欢迎标语的横幅，汽车花费了二小时的时间才通过了几十座欢迎拱门。在一些地方，拱门附近聚集着数以千计的人群，他们高呼友好的口号并且向每一辆经过的汽车投掷鲜花。辛德利市中心被街道上、拱门上和广场上装饰的彩色灯光照耀得如同白昼。街道上拥挤着欢迎的人群，好像是全市的居民都走到街上来欢迎似的。
