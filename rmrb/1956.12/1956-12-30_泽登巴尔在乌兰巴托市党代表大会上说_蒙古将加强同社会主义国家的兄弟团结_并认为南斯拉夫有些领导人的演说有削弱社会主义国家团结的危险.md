Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, December 29th: The Ninth Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in Ulaanbaatar City was held from December 26th to 28th.

    Tsedenbal, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, spoke at the closing meeting, discussing the current international situation. He said that international reactionaries are using the Hungarian incident to launch a frenzied slander against the big family of countries headed by the Soviet Union and the international communist movement. International reactionaries are doing their utmost to undermine the unity of the people of socialist countries and negate the socialist achievements they have made in selfless revolutionary struggles. Faced with such a situation, it is the duty of every Communist Party member and every honest worker to strengthen and consolidate the unity of socialist countries, remain steadfastly loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, and be vigilant against the enemy's schemes of provocation and sabotage.

    He said that some recent speeches by Yugoslav leaders carry the danger of weakening the solidarity of socialist countries. Many fraternal parties have already criticized their speeches, and we agree with those criticisms.

    Tsedenbal said that with the help of the Soviet Union, Mongolia has achieved great success in the past thirty-five years. We must humbly learn from the struggle experience of the Soviet Union and fraternal parties. In the future, we must further strengthen our fraternal solidarity with the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries.

    Damdin, Secretary of the Ulaanbaatar City Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, reported on the work since the Eighth Congress in 1954. He said that the capital's industry and urban construction have made great achievements in the past two years. This year, all industrial systems completed their production tasks ahead of schedule. In the first four years of the second five-year plan (1953-1957), the city completed more than 260,000 square meters of buildings, an increase of 30.8% compared to the first five-year plan period. By the end of November this year, the number of party members in the city had increased by 20.7% compared to the Eighth Congress.

    The party congresses recently held in various provinces and cities of Mongolia have now concluded one after another.

    泽登巴尔在乌兰巴托市党代表大会上说
    蒙古将加强同社会主义国家的兄弟团结
    并认为南斯拉夫有些领导人的演说有削弱社会主义国家团结的危险
    据新华社乌兰巴托29日电　蒙古人民革命党乌兰巴托市第九次代表大会12月26日到28日举行了会议。
    蒙古人民革命党中央政治局委员泽登巴尔在闭幕会议上发言，谈到了目前的国际局势。他说，国际反动派利用匈牙利事件对以苏联为首的各国大家庭和国际共产主义运动进行了疯狂的诽谤。国际反动派竭尽全力破坏社会主义国家人民的团结，取消他们在忘我的革命斗争中取得的社会主义成果。面临着这样的局势，增强和巩固社会主义国家的团结、始终不渝地忠于无产阶级国际主义的原则、警惕敌人的挑拨破坏阴谋，是每个共产党员和每个正直的劳动者的义务。
    他说，南斯拉夫有些领导人最近发表的演说有削弱社会主义国家团结的危险，许多兄弟党已经对他们的演说提出了批评，我们同意那些批评意见。
    泽登巴尔说，蒙古在苏联的帮助下，在过去的三十五年中获得了巨大成就。我们要虚心学习苏联和兄弟党的斗争经验。今后更要加强同苏联、中国和其它人民民主国家的兄弟团结。
    蒙古人民革命党乌兰巴托市委书记达姆丁报告了从1954年的第八次代表大会以来的工作情况，他说，首都的工业和城市建设两年来有很大成就。今年各工业系统提前完成了生产任务。在第二个五年计划（1953—1957年）的头四年中，全市完成了二十六万多平方公尺的建筑物，比第一个五年计划期间增加了30.8％。到今年11月底，全市党员比第八次代表大会时增加了20.7％。
    现在蒙古各省市在最近举行的党代表大会已经先后结束。
