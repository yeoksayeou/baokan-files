(Dispatch from our newspaper) The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is taking a series of important measures to vigorously consolidate agricultural production cooperatives.

After the upgrading and merging of cooperatives before the autumn harvest, Guangdong Province has basically achieved advanced cooperativization. Judging from the recent production and management situation of cooperatives in various places, the vast majority of cooperatives in the province are consolidated. However, some cooperatives are not consolidated; in these cooperatives, a small number of members have requested to withdraw. This problem is particularly prominent in economic crop areas and areas where production is not doing well. According to surveys in various parts of Guangdong, there are three main types of people who request to withdraw from the cooperatives: first, wealthy middle peasants and some households with special income before joining the cooperatives; second, households with labor shortages and difficulties; and third, households whose income has decreased after joining the cooperatives due to previous engagement in other occupations (such as small merchants, handicraftsmen, those who used to be engaged in service industries or transportation, fishermen, salt workers, etc.). The Guangdong Provincial Committee believes that the fundamental reason for this problem is that the production of some agricultural cooperatives has not been successful. This year, the work of developing cooperatives in many places has been relatively rough, the management of cooperatives is backward, there are errors in production leadership, and natural disasters have further damaged late rice crops, which has resulted in a reduction in income for some agricultural cooperatives. Secondly, due to various restrictions, the production level of most agricultural cooperatives cannot catch up with the wealthy middle peasants who had more means of production and stronger management and production skills in the past. In addition, after the opening of free markets, many farmers plan to abandon agriculture and engage in commerce, which is also one of the reasons for the wavering thoughts of some members (especially those who were originally engaged in other occupations).

In order to quickly change this situation and further consolidate the cooperatives, the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has organized cadres to conduct in-depth investigations and studies in economic crop areas. In the middle of last month, the Provincial Committee also held a meeting attended by district party committee secretaries, prefectural party committee secretaries, or heads of rural work departments of prefectural party committees to specifically study ways to consolidate agricultural cooperatives. The meeting decided that from November to the end of January next year, the focus of rural work throughout the province is to improve production and consolidate agricultural cooperatives, and through doing a good job in the production and distribution of agricultural cooperatives, to focus on educating those farmers with wavering thoughts, so as to strengthen their confidence in taking the road of cooperativization.

Recently, various parts of Guangdong are seizing the following key aspects to vigorously consolidate agricultural cooperatives: First, implement the Party's class line in rural areas, educate and encourage rural cadres, rely on poor and lower-middle peasants (facts have proved that the vast majority of them are determined to take the socialist road), unite with upper-middle peasants, organize the team well, and unite to improve the work of the cooperatives. Second, quickly arrange and launch winter production, and on the basis of fully promoting democracy and following the mass line, review and summarize this year's production, and formulate next year's production plan. In analyzing the reasons for reduced production and income and formulating production plans, find reliable guarantees for increasing production next year, and encourage cooperative members to have confidence in doing a good job in production. Third, vigorously promote mutually beneficial policies; in income distribution, proactively give necessary consideration to upper-middle peasants and households with special income, as well as households with weak labor forces. Local experiences have proved that doing so can initially reverse the situation within a few days and stabilize the emotions of some members with wavering thoughts to a certain extent.

The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches particular importance to the implementation of mutually beneficial policies in studying the issue of consolidating agricultural cooperatives. The Provincial Committee believes that the key issue in the current mutually beneficial policy is to properly handle the relationship between adhering to the basic principle of distribution according to labor and giving some consideration to certain households to unite the majority. The Provincial Committee believes that after the abolition of land remuneration, making appropriate concessions and giving consideration to "households with reduced income at both ends" (difficult households with weak labor forces and wealthy households with higher production levels in the past) is beneficial to the production of the cooperatives and to the poor peasants. To solve this problem, it is necessary to pay attention to the following aspects: First, solve the problem of the disparity in income between villages. Due to different production conditions between villages (or production teams), the difference in income is too large, which easily leads to the problem of farmers in wealthy villages demanding separation and withdrawal from the cooperatives. The principle for solving this problem should be: try to consolidate the original cooperatives, give appropriate consideration to wealthy villages (for example, take a few percent of the net income of the wealthy village as a reward for the members of this village; contract production according to the village, so that villages with good production conditions have lower production quotas, and the excess production will be distributed by the village, etc.). If the farmers do not agree to do so, the method of running joint cooperatives can also be adopted - the joint cooperative unifies planning and retains public accumulation funds and public welfare funds, and establishes branch cooperatives below, with each accounting for its own profits and losses. In addition, in addition to the part operated uniformly by the cooperative, certain production undertakings can be allowed to be operated by each team, and the income is distributed within the team. Only when it is really impossible to be together, will the division of cooperatives be implemented. Second, for wealthy households and households with special income that occupy more and better mountains, forests, fruit trees and other perennial economic crops, fish ponds, etc., the proportion of dividends can be relaxed (the dividend ratio is slightly higher and the time is longer), or a portion of private fruit trees and private forests can be allowed to be retained, and small ponds can also be retained privately, or contracted production can be implemented according to households (the particularly good land, fish ponds, etc. are contracted to the original owners to operate, the contracted production is slightly lower, and most of the excess production belongs to the household, and a small part belongs to the cooperative) to take care of them. Third, for difficult households with a lack of labor, the main measures are to help them develop family sideline occupations that they can handle, or to provide certain subsidies and retain a portion of land dividends to take care of them. Fourth, for those who were originally small merchants or engaged in service industries before joining the cooperative, and whose income has decreased a lot after joining the cooperative, and who therefore firmly request to withdraw from the cooperative, a part of them can be approved to withdraw from the cooperative according to market needs; those who were originally handicraftsmen or engaged in transportation can be approved to withdraw from the cooperative and engage in their original profession, or they can organize professional groups within the cooperative, calculate work points according to technical work points according to value, or allow such groups to be responsible for their own profits and losses, and only uniformly retain public accumulation funds and public welfare funds within the cooperative.

At present, various parts of Guangdong are stabilizing the emotions of cooperative members in accordance with these methods. After doing so in economic crop areas such as Zhongshan and Shunde, where the thoughts of some members were originally more wavering, the situation has basically stabilized. From the perspective of the entire province, more efforts are needed to consolidate those agricultural cooperatives with more ideological problems among their members.

    教育和鼓励农村干部　依靠贫农和下中农
    广东省采取积极措施巩固农业社
    要求贯彻执行互利政策，坚持按劳取酬的原则，并适当照顾减收户
    本报讯　中共广东省委员会正在采取一系列重要措施，大力巩固农业生产合作社。
    经过秋收前的升级并社工作，广东省已经基本上实现了高级合作化。从各地合作社最近时期的生产和经营管理情况看来，这个省的绝大部分合作社是巩固的。但是也有一部分合作社是不巩固的；在这些合作社中，发生了少数社员要求退社的情况。特别是在经济作物区和生产搞得不好的地区，这个问题比较突出。据广东各地调查，要求退社的主要有三种人：一是富裕中农和一部分入社前有特殊收入的户；二是缺乏劳动力的困难户；三是入社前从事其他职业，入社后收入减少的户（如小商贩，手工业者，曾从事服务性行业或运输业的人，渔民，盐民等）。广东省委认为，产生这个问题的根本原因，是一部分农业社的生产没有搞好。今年不少地方发展合作社的工作做得比较粗糙，合作社的经营管理落后，生产领导上有错误，再加晚稻遭受了自然灾害，这就使得一部分农业社的收入减少了。其次的原因是多数农业社受种种条件的限制，生产水平一时还赶不上过去生产资料多、经营能力和生产技术强的富裕中农。另外，开放自由市场以后，不少农民打算弃农就商，也是部分社员（特别是原来从事其他职业的人）思想动摇的原因之一。
    为了迅速改变这种情况，把合作社进一步巩固起来，中共广东省委曾先后组织干部在经济作物区深入地进行调查研究。上月中旬，省委又召开了有区党委书记、地委书记或地委农村工作部长参加的会议，专门研究巩固农业社的办法。会议决定，从11月到明年1月底，全省农村工作的中心是搞好生产和巩固农业社，通过做好农业社的生产和分配工作，着重教育那些思想动摇的农民，以坚定他们走合作化道路的信心。
    最近时期，广东各地正在抓住以下几个主要环节，大力巩固农业社：一、贯彻执行党在农村的阶级路线，教育和鼓励农村干部，依靠贫农和下中农（事实证明，他们绝大多数是坚决走社会主义道路的），团结上中农，组织好队伍，团结一心改进合作社的工作。二、迅速安排和发动冬季生产，并在充分发扬民主、走群众路线的基础上，检查、总结今年的生产，订好明年的生产计划。在分析减产、减收的原因和制定生产计划中，找出明年增产的可靠保证，鼓舞社员群众搞好生产的信心。三、大力宣传互利政策；在收益分配上，主动地给上中农和有特殊收入的户以及劳动力弱的户以必要的照顾。各地的经验证明，凡是这样做的，几天之内，就能初步扭转情况，在一定程度上稳定部分思想动摇的社员的情绪。
    中共广东省委在研究巩固农业社的问题上，特别重视贯彻执行互利政策问题。省委认为当前互利政策上的关键问题，是处理好坚持按劳取酬的基本原则和对某些户加以若干照顾以团结大多数这两者的关系问题。省委认为，在取消土地报酬以后，对“两头减收户”（劳动力弱的困难户和原来生产水平较高的富裕户）作适当的让步和照顾，对于合作社的生产，对于贫农都有好处。解决这个问题，需要着重注意以下几个方面：一、解决村和村之间的收入情况悬殊的问题。由于村和村（或生产队和生产队）之间生产条件不同，收入相差太大，容易引起富裕村的农民要求分社、退社的问题。解决这个问题的原则应该是：尽量把原有的社巩固下来，给富裕村以适当照顾（例如，从富裕村纯收入中拿出百分之几作为对这个村社员的奖励；按村包产，使生产条件好的村包产低点，超额增产部分归这个村分配等），如果农民不同意这样做，也可以采取办联社的办法——联社统一计划，统一留公积金、公益金，下面建立分社，各计盈亏。此外，还可以在合作社统一经营部分之外，允许某些生产事业由各队自己经营，收入在队内分配。只有实在不能在一起的时候，才实行分社。二、对于占有山林、果树及其他多年生经济作物、鱼塘等较多较好的富裕户和有特殊收入户，可以放宽比例分红（分红比例略高一些，时间长一些），或者允许酌留一部分自留果树、自留林，小口的塘也可以自留，或者实行按户包产（将特殊好的土地、鱼塘等包给原主经营，包产稍低一些，超产部分大部归该户，小部归社），加以照顾。三、对缺乏劳动力的困难户，主要采取帮助他们发展力能胜任的家庭副业，或者给予一定的补助以及保留部分土地分红等办法予以照顾。四、对入社前原系小商贩或从事服务性行业，入社后收入减少很多，因而坚决要求退社的，可根据市场需要，批准他们之中的一部分退社；原来是手工业者或从事运输业的，可以批准退社从事原来的专业，也可以在社内组织专业小组，按技术工分按值计工，也可以允许这种小组自负盈亏，只把公积金、公益金统一留在社内。
    目前，广东各地正在按照这些办法，稳定社员的情绪。原来部分社员思想动摇比较严重的中山、顺德等经济作物地区，这样做了以后，情况已经基本上稳定下来。从全省来说，要把社员思想问题较多的那些农业社都巩固下来，还需要作更多的努力。
