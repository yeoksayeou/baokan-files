Our newspaper, Hefei, 27th - The entire staff of the Anhui Provincial People's Court has consistently maintained a diligent and frugal style for several years, saving state expenditures; personal lives are well-arranged, and the vast majority have savings in the bank. The Anhui Provincial People's Court's judicial operating expenses were more than halved in 1955 compared to 1954; this year, it will be reduced by another third compared to last year. Administrative expenses have also had surpluses every year since 1954, which are turned over to the state. They have adopted the method of regularly publishing expenditures to the staff, so the use of money is supervised by the masses, which also inspires the staff to consciously save on expenses. Their office is in an old ancestral hall; the buildings are old, and only have been reorganized and repaired on the old foundation, adding some thatched houses, spending very little money, but it is arranged very neatly and comfortably. Although the staff dormitories are simple, they all have houses to live in with little money spent, and the staff are also very satisfied. The responsible persons of the office are very frugal in their clothing and food, and never let the logistics personnel add any new furniture to their offices and dormitories; they have cars, but rarely drive them casually. Most of the responsible persons ride bicycles, take public transportation, or walk. They regularly educate employees on thrift at general meetings of all personnel. Under their leadership, all employees have also developed a simple and frugal style. There are currently seventy-nine people in this office, and seventy-two of them participate in savings. The total monthly salary of the entire office is only more than 5,900 yuan, but the average savings balance from July to December is more than 3,100 yuan, reaching more than 50% of the total salary.

    安徽省人民法院发扬光荣传统
    从上到下一贯俭朴
    本报合肥27日电　安徽省人民法院全体工作人员，数年来一直保持了勤俭朴素的作风，节省了国家开支；个人生活安排得当，绝大多数人都在银行有储蓄。安徽省人民法院的司法事业费用，1955年比1954年节约了一半多；今年比去年又将节约三分之一。行政费用从1954年以后，也年年都有节余，上缴国家。他们采取了经常向工作人员公布开支的办法，使用钱得到群众的监督，同时也启发了工作人员自觉地节约开支。他们的机关是在一个旧祠堂内，房屋古旧，只在旧基础上进行整理和修缮，加盖一些草屋，花钱很少，但是安排得十分整洁安适。职工宿舍虽然简陋，但是在少花钱的条件下，却都有了房子住，职工也很满意。机关负责人员穿吃都很俭朴，从来不让总务人员在他们的办公室和宿舍新添置什么家具；他们有小汽车，但平常很少随意开动，负责人员大半骑自行车、坐公共汽车和步行。他们在全体人员大会上，经常教育职工节约。全体职工在他们的带动下，也都养成了朴素节约风气。这个机关内现有人员七十九个人，参加储蓄的就有七十二个人。他们全机关每月的工资总额才五千九百多元，7月到12月平均存款的余额就有三千一百多元，达工资总额的50％以上。
