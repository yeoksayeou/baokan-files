Do Not Allow Aggressors to Rekindle Fires in the Middle East

After the failure of the Anglo-French and Israeli aggression against Egypt, which forced them to cease fire, people all over the world hoped that the situation in the Middle East would quickly ease and that peace could be rebuilt in the Middle East. However, while the invading forces have not yet withdrawn from Egypt and peace has not yet been restored to Egypt, Western colonial countries are plotting new aggressive conspiracies in the Middle East. They are attempting to continue setting fires in the Middle East, dragging the people of Middle Eastern countries back into the bloody abyss of war.

Recently, the ruling groups of Britain, France, and the United States, colluding with Asian countries participating in the Baghdad Pact, have launched a large-scale propaganda campaign against Syria. They insist that the independent policy pursued by the Syrian government to maintain national independence and sovereignty is a "communist threat" and a "Soviet threat," and they slander and intimidate Syria and Jordan. This is clearly a preparation of public opinion for their new acts of aggression.

There are now many facts that show that Western colonial countries are actively carrying out their aggressive conspiracies against the Middle East under the smokescreen of this so-called "communist threat" and "Soviet threat." Earlier, Iraq, taking advantage of the Anglo-French attack on Egypt, advanced troops into Jordan on the one hand and smuggled a large amount of arms into Syria and Jordan on the other, attempting to create a coup in Syria and Jordan and subvert the governments of Syria and Jordan. This was part of the conspiracy. After the conspiracy to instigate a coup in Syria and Jordan was thwarted, Western colonial countries then directed Turkey to station troops on the Turkish-Syrian border, ready to launch a military offensive against Syria in coordination with Iraq and Israel. It is quite obvious that Western colonial countries are expanding the threat of war against Middle Eastern countries at this time in an attempt to take advantage of the fact that the main force of the Egyptian army is tied down west of the Suez Canal and cannot support Syria and Jordan with armed forces, to crush the current Syrian government and occupy Jordan, so as to split the Arab League, isolate Egypt, and drag Arab countries into the Baghdad Pact group that serves the aggressive interests of Western colonialism. They are attempting to use this to recover from the failure of their military adventure against Egypt.

It is particularly noteworthy that the United States, which calls itself a "friend of Arab countries," has completely exposed its true colors in planning this new aggressive conspiracy. Recently, reactionary American newspapers have openly encouraged Iraq's provocative actions against Syria. U.S. government spokesmen have repeatedly attacked Syria. The United States is holding frequent talks with Britain, France, and members of the Baghdad Pact. After the Turkish ambassador to Washington held talks with the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, Turkey openly clamored for launching an armed offensive against Syria, and the U.S. State Department also publicly stated that it would support the Baghdad Pact countries. This statement by the U.S. State Department was immediately welcomed by British and French officials. According to Reuters, the United States and Britain have "unified policy planning" in the so-called "new Middle East conflict" between Syria and Iraq. These facts fully expose the face of the United States taking consistent steps with Britain and France to invade Arab countries, demonstrating that American colonialists are the most sinister enemies striving to strangle the independence and freedom of Arab countries.

However, no matter how cunning imperialism is, the Arab countries have long seen through their aggressive conspiracies. Syria has issued an appeal to the United Nations, demanding the immediate cessation of the aggressors' conspiracy to instigate war; and has notified governments of various countries, expressing its determination to defend Syria's freedom and independence and Middle East peace. Syrian Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali said: "Syria and other Arab countries are full of determination to defend their independence, honor, and freedom, and they will not allow anyone to invade an inch of their land." The people of Egypt and other Arab countries have also expressed their intention to strengthen the unity of Arab countries, support each other, and resolutely resist new imperialist offensives.

All peace-loving countries and peoples must be a hundred times more vigilant, resolutely oppose the conspiracy of the United States, Britain, and France to instigate a new war of aggression in the Middle East, and stop the aggressors from rekindling fires in the Middle East.

### 不许侵略者在中东重新放火

    不许侵略者在中东重新放火
    英、法和以色列侵略埃及遭受失败而被迫停火以后，全世界人民都希望中东局势迅速和缓下来，使中东得以重建和平。但是，在侵略军还没有从埃及撤退、埃及的和平还没有恢复的时候，西方殖民国家却又在中东地区策划新的侵略阴谋，它们企图在中东继续放火，把中东国家的人民重新拖进战争的血泊里。
    近日以来，英国、法国、美国的统治集团勾结参加巴格达条约的亚洲国家，正在发动一个反对叙利亚的大规模宣传运动。它们把叙利亚政府所奉行的维护民族独立和主权的独立政策，硬说成是什么“共产党的威胁”、“苏联的威胁”，并对叙利亚和约旦大事污蔑和恫吓。这显然是为它们的新侵略行动进行舆论准备。
    现在有许多事实说明，西方殖民国家就在这种所谓“共产党的威胁”、“苏联的威胁”的烟幕下，积极进行它们对中东的侵略阴谋。早些时候，伊拉克趁英法进攻埃及的机会，就一面进兵约旦，一面偷运大批军火到叙利亚和约旦，企图在叙利亚和约旦制造政变，颠复叙利亚和约旦的政府，这是阴谋的一部分。在叙利亚和约旦策动政变的阴谋遭到挫折后，西方殖民国家便指使土耳其陈兵土叙边境，随时准备配合伊拉克、以色列发动对叙利亚的军事进攻。十分明显，西方殖民国家在这个时候扩大对中东国家的战争威胁，是想乘埃及军队主力被牵制在苏伊士运河以西、不能以武装力量支援叙利亚和约旦的时机，搞垮叙利亚现政府和占领约旦，以分裂阿拉伯联盟，孤立埃及，并把阿拉伯国家拖入为西方殖民主义侵略利益服务的巴格达条约集团。它们企图以此来挽回对埃及的军事冒险的失败。
    值得特别注意的是，口口声声称作“阿拉伯国家的朋友”的美国，在策划这个新的侵略阴谋上完全暴露出自己的真面貌。最近以来，美国的反动报纸就在公开鼓励伊拉克对叙利亚的挑衅行动。美国政府发言人也一再对叙利亚进行攻击。美国和英法及巴格达条约成员国之间进行着频繁的会谈。土耳其驻华盛顿大使同美国助理国务卿会谈以后，土耳其国内就公开叫喊着要对叙利亚发动武装进攻，美国国务院也公开声明要支持巴格达条约国家。美国国务院的这一声明，立刻受到了英、法官方人士的欢迎。据路透社透露，美国和英国在所谓叙利亚和伊拉克的“新的中东冲突”中已经“统一规划政策”。这些事实，充分暴露了美国正同英法采取一致步调侵略阿拉伯国家的面貌，说明美国殖民主义者是力图绞杀阿拉伯国家独立自由的最险恶的敌人。
    但是，不论帝国主义怎样诡计多端，各阿拉伯国家早已识破了它们的侵略阴谋。叙利亚已经向联合国发出呼吁，要求立即制止侵略者挑动战争的阴谋；并已照会各国政府，表示决心保卫叙利亚的自由独立和中东和平。叙利亚总理萨布里·阿萨里说：“叙利亚和其它阿拉伯国家充满决心保卫自己的独立、荣誉和自由，他们不许任何人侵略自己的一寸土地。”埃及和其它阿拉伯国家人民也都表示要加强阿拉伯各国的团结，互相支援，坚决抗击帝国主义的新的进攻。
    一切爱好和平的国家和人民都必须百倍地提高警惕，坚决反对美、英、法在中东策动新侵略战争的阴谋，制止侵略者在中东重新放火。
