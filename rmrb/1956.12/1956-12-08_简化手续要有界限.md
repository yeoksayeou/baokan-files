　　Simplification of Procedures Must Have Limits
　　Kong Sang
　　No matter what you do, it is human nature to hope that the procedures are simpler and the red tape is less.
　　However, "simplification" must have a limit. For industrial production, to simplify procedures and eliminate red tape, it must be considered whether it is conducive to the development of production, and this must not be considered only from the work of a certain department.
　　For example, in the past, when commercial departments sold industrial products at unified prices, it did save the commercial departments the trouble of grading and classifying the products. Inspection and pricing were very convenient, but some factories saw that good and bad products were the same price, and slowly became indifferent to the quality of their products and began to manufacture them roughly. As a result, consumers complained that they could not buy good things, while the counters and warehouses of the stores were filled with various substandard products, which tied up state funds. This shortcoming was corrected not long ago after the implementation of the procurement method of grading and pricing according to quality.
　　Recently, Comrade Zhang Zuoli from the local state-owned Jilin Province Cannery wrote to this newspaper to reflect that the method of calculating profits prescribed by the China Food Export Company to the cannery has the same problem: profit equals actual cost multiplied by a uniform profit rate. The procedure is indeed very simple: it saves the trouble of treating saving units and waste units differently, but it has caused dissatisfaction among factories with achievements in saving. Comrade Zhang Zuoli said: "In order for the factory to obtain more profits and to better complete the state's financial plan, our factory has every reason to greatly increase the cost of products!"
　　On the premise of ensuring product quality, continuously reducing product costs is one of the main tasks of all employees of socialist enterprises. Not to mention greatly increasing, even slightly increasing the cost is not appropriate. However, Comrade Zhang Zuoli's words do reflect the employees' grievances. If they really increase the cost of the product, then it is not unreasonable. Because the employees have worked hard to find ways to save raw materials, overcome waste, and reduce costs, which has increased the country's income, they should have been commended and rewarded; however, due to the unreasonable method of calculating profits, the company's income has not only not increased, but has decreased instead, and the more successful the savings, the lower the cost, and the less the income, and there is even the possibility of failing to complete the profit delivery plan. If the profit delivery plan is not completed, the superiors will criticize, the factory director's fund will be gone, and therefore the welfare undertakings of the employees will not be able to be carried out. Those factories that do not pay attention to saving and waste seriously should have been criticized, but because the actual cost of their products is high, the company's income is large, so the profit delivery plan is also completed well, and the factory director's fund and welfare undertakings are also available. Is this not reversing right and wrong, criticizing those who should be rewarded, and rewarding those who should be criticized, isn't it打击先进、鼓励人们向落后看齐what?
　　The lesson learned from this is: procedures should be simplified as much as possible, but simplification must also have a limit. Removing some necessary procedures will be detrimental to production and detrimental to the country and the people.

### 简化手续要有界限

　　简化手续要有界限
　　孔桑
    不论做什么事，总希望手续简单一些，清规戒律少一些，这是人之常情。
    但是，“简化”要有个界限。对工业生产来说，要简化手续，要铲除清规戒律，必须考虑到是不是有利于生产的发展，这是决不可以只从某一部门工作来考虑的。
    例如以前商业部门以统一价格包销工业产品的时候，从商业部门来说，的确省去了把产品分等分级的手续，验货计价都很方便，可是有些工厂看见好货次货都一个价钱，便慢慢地不关心自己产品质量，粗制滥造起来。结果，消费者埋怨买不到好东西，而商店的柜台里、仓库里却堆积着各种次货，积压了国家资金。这个缺点，不久以前实行按质分等论价的收购办法以后才改正了。
    最近，地方国营吉林省罐头厂张作礼同志给本报来信反映，中国食品出口公司给罐头厂规定的计算利润的方法，也有同样毛病：利润等于实际成本乘统一利润率。手续也的确是很简单的：省去了分别对待节约单位和浪费单位的麻烦，但是，引起了节约有成就的工厂的不满。张作礼同志说：“为了使工厂获得更多的利润，为了更好地完成国家财务计划，我们工厂完全有理由大大提高产品成本！”
    在保证产品质量的前提下，不断地降低产品成本，是社会主义企业全体职工的主要任务之一。不说大大提高，就是稍为提高一下成本也是不应当的。不过，张作礼同志的话，确实反映了职工们的不平之鸣。要是他们真的提高产品成本，那末，并不是没有道理可讲的。因为职工们辛辛苦苦地想办法节约了原材料，克服了浪费，降低了成本，为国家增加了收入，本来是应该受到表扬和奖励的；但是，由于利润的计算方法不合理，企业的收入不仅没有增加，反而减少了，并且节约越有成绩，成本越降低，收入越少，甚至有完不成上缴利润计划的可能。完不成利润上缴计划，上级的批评来了，厂长基金没有了，因而职工的福利事业也就办不起来。而那些不注意节约，浪费严重的工厂，本来是应该受到批评的，但是因为他们产品的实际成本高，企业收入就大，所以上缴利润计划也完成得好，厂长基金、福利事业也都跟着有了。这样是非颠倒，该受奖励的挨了批评，该受批评的得到奖励，这不是打击先进、鼓励人们向落后看齐是什么？
    从这里得出的教训是：手续应当尽可能简化，但是简化也要有界限，把一些必要的手续去掉了，就会对生产不利，对国家和人民不利。
