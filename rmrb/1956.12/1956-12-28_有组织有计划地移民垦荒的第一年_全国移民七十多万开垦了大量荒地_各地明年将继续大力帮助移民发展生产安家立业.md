Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: 1956 was the first year of organized and planned immigration and land reclamation in our country. According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, a total of 725,000 people immigrated nationwide this year, exceeding the total number of immigrants from 1949 to 1955.

This year, a total of 432,000 residents were relocated from densely populated provinces and cities such as Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai to Heilongjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and other provinces (autonomous regions) for land reclamation. In addition, more than 292,000 people in eighteen provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Liaoning, Jilin, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu immigrated and reclaimed land within their respective provinces.

After the residents moved to new places, they reclaimed a large amount of wasteland and increased grain production for the country. Residents who moved to Heilongjiang Province reclaimed 6 million mu of wasteland this year, and planted more than 2.1 million mu in the spring, with an average of 18 mu planted per person. Residents who moved to Inner Mongolia reclaimed a total of 190,000 mu of wasteland. Residents who moved to Qinghai Province to participate in local agricultural production cooperatives reclaimed more than 323,000 mu of wasteland and intercropped land. In addition, residents who moved to Qinghai Province to establish new villages have reclaimed more than 10,000 mu of wasteland, with an average of more than 10 mu reclaimed per person. Most of the crops they planted have yielded good harvests. Residents who moved to Heilongjiang Province to establish new villages harvested more than 4,000 jin of corn per hectare, about 2,500 jin of millet per hectare, and nearly 10,000 jin of potatoes per hectare, with a total grain output of 120,000 tons.

Because the residents who moved to the new areas actively participated in labor production, many people's income this year exceeded their income in their original residence. More than 100,800 young and middle-aged land reclamation team members who moved to Heilongjiang Province earned an average of more than 200 yuan per person this year, and many people earned more than 400 yuan, an increase compared to their income in their original residence. Among the thirty-three households that moved to the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Dunhuang County, Gansu Province, the living standards of twenty-eight households have improved compared to their original residence. Among the sixty-six households that moved to Dayuan Township, Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, 90% have been able to support themselves, and 30% have surplus grain.

The state provided great support to the residents who moved to new areas for land reclamation. The travel expenses required for their relocation, the costs of housing and building new village roads, bridges, wells, etc. after moving to the new areas were all resolved by state investment. The state also helped them solve many difficulties in production and life with large investments and loans, of which non-repayable investments accounted for about 70%. The state's investment in immigration affairs in nine provinces and regions including Heilongjiang, Gansu, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia alone amounted to more than 110 million yuan. The state purchased 500 tractors for the residents who moved to Heilongjiang Province, built 25,000 houses, and also established many health clinics, supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural technology extension stations, and postal agencies in the new villages.

The person in charge of the Immigration Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs said that due to the lack of experience in large-scale immigration in various regions, some shortcomings also occurred in the immigration work this year. Some regions exaggerated the superior conditions of the resettlement areas when publicizing to the relocated residents, and did not realistically explain the difficult conditions; a few regions did not do enough to prepare for the resettlement of new residents, for example, the houses were not adequately prepared, and the supply of daily necessities such as grain and vegetables was not timely, which caused some difficulties for the relocated residents. In addition, there is still a mentality of "reluctance to leave one's homeland" among the general residents, and a few residents do not have enough spirit to overcome difficulties and want to rely on the government to solve all their difficulties. In addition, some places have neglected to conduct regular ideological education work for the newly relocated residents, and as a result, a few residents were frightened by some temporary difficulties and returned to their original residence from the resettlement area. Based on these situations, the relevant authorities in various regions have taken effective measures and are prepared to vigorously help the residents who moved to the new areas in 1957 to complete the land reclamation and planting tasks according to plan, and at the same time help them bring nearly 200,000 family members to their new residences so that they can settle down there. In areas where reservoirs are being built, such as Sanmenxia and Xin'anjiang, there are still nearly 100,000 residents who need to be relocated. In 1957, provinces with vast land and sparse populations will also select some arable wasteland and send a group of young and middle-aged people from densely populated areas as vanguards to build houses and reclaim wasteland in order to prepare for the immigration work in 1958.

### 有组织有计划地移民垦荒的第一年  全国移民七十多万开垦了大量荒地  各地明年将继续大力帮助移民发展生产安家立业

    有组织有计划地移民垦荒的第一年
    全国移民七十多万开垦了大量荒地
    各地明年将继续大力帮助移民发展生产安家立业
    新华社27日讯　1956年是我国有组织有计划地移民垦荒的第一年。据内务部最近的统计，今年全国移民共七十二万五千多人，超过了1949年到1955年内移民的总和。
    今年从人口密集的山东、河南、河北和北京、天津、上海等省、市，移到黑龙江、甘肃、青海、江西、内蒙古、新疆等省（区）垦荒的居民，共有四十三万二千多人。此外，广东、福建、辽宁、吉林、浙江、江苏等十八个省，还有二十九万二千多人在省内移民垦荒。
    居民们徙移到新的地方以后，开垦了大量荒地，为国家增产了许多粮食。移到黑龙江省的居民今年开垦荒地六百万亩，春季播种二百一十多万亩，平均每人播种十八亩。移到内蒙古的居民共开荒十九万亩。移到青海省参加当地农业生产合作社的居民共开荒和种间歇地三十二万三千多亩，另外移到青海省建立新村的居民已开荒一万多亩，平均每人开荒十多亩。他们种植的农作物大部分都获得丰收。移到黑龙江省建立新村的居民种的玉米每公顷产量在四千斤以上，谷子每公顷产量二千五百斤左右，马铃薯每公顷产量近一万斤，粮食总产量达十二万吨。
    由于移到新地的居民积极参加劳动生产，有许多人今年的收入超过了在原居住地的收入。移到黑龙江省的十万零八千多名青、壮年垦荒队员，今年平均每人收入二百元以上，也有不少的人收入达到四百元以上，比在原籍收入增加了。移到甘肃省敦煌县前进农业社的三十三户居民，有二十八户的生活水平比在原居住地提高。移到青海省湟中县大元乡的六十六户居民有90％已经能够自给，其中30％还有余粮。
    国家对移到新地垦荒的居民给予了极大的支援。他们在迁移时所需的路费，迁移到新地后的住屋和建设新村道路、桥梁、水井等费用，都由国家投资解决。国家还以大量投资和贷款帮助他们解决生产上和生活上的许多困难，其中无偿的投资占70％左右。仅黑龙江、甘肃、青海、内蒙古等九个省区，国家对移民事业的投资即达一亿一千多万元。国家为移到黑龙江省的居民购买的拖拉机有五百台，修建的房屋有两万五千间，并且还在新村设立了许多卫生所、供销合作社、农业技术推广站和邮政代办所等。
    内务部移民局的负责人说，由于各地对大规模移民缺乏经验，今年有些地区在移民工作中也产生了一些缺点。部分地区在向移出居民进行宣传的时候，夸大了安置地区的优越条件，没有实事求是地讲清困难条件；少数地区对安置新居民的准备工作做得不够妥善，例如房子准备得不够，粮食和蔬菜等生活必需品供应得不及时，这些都给移去的居民造成了一定的困难。另外，在一般居民中还存在着“故土难离”的思想，有少数居民克服困难的精神不够，想依靠政府来解决他们所有的困难问题。加上有些地方忽视了对新移去的居民进行经常的思想教育工作，结果就有少数居民被一些暂时的困难吓倒，从安置地返回了原籍。根据这些情况，各地有关机关已经采取了有效措施，并且准备在1957年大力帮助移到新地的居民按计划完成开荒和播种任务，同时帮助他们把将近二十万名家属接到新居住地来，以便使他们在那里安家立业。在三门峡、新安江等建设水库的地区，大约还有近十万居民需要迁移。在1957年内，地广人稀的省份还将选择好一部分适宜耕种的荒地，由人口密集地区派出一部分青壮年作为先遣队前去盖房和开荒，以便为1958年的移民工作作好准备。
