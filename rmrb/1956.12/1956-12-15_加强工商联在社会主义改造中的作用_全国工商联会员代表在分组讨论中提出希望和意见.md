Xinhua News Agency, December 14th. Delegates attending the Second Member Representative Assembly of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce today held group discussions on the Federation's three-year work report, three-year financial report, and the Articles of Association (draft).

Delegates all agreed with the three-year work report, believing that it was factual and realistic. Delegates from various regions felt that the Federation of Industry and Commerce had done a great deal of work in the past three years in assisting the government in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and in uniting and educating industrialists and business people to accept the transformation. Many delegates believed that in the past, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, in conjunction with the central tasks of the state in various periods, carried out propaganda and education work and organized industrialists and business people to study theory and current affairs policies, which was very helpful in raising their patriotism and ideological transformation. They hoped that the leadership and organization of learning would be further strengthened in the future, and that the Federation would assist local industrial and commercial circles in solving some of the difficulties encountered in learning. Wu Xiaogao, a delegate from Guizhou Province, said that after listening to the report, he dispelled doubts about whether the Federation of Industry and Commerce still had the necessity to exist and clarified that this organization was not without anything to do after the overall public-private partnership of the entire industry, but rather had a lot of work to do.

Delegates from various regions offered criticisms and suggestions on the shortcomings of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce's work and its future work. Delegates from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Fujian, Liaoning, and other provinces pointed out that the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce had not given enough attention and care to regions with a smaller proportion of private industry and commerce, as well as to small merchants and peddlers. Yu Xianfa, a delegate from Shanghai, and Lu Guangji, a delegate from Liaoning Province, hoped that the staff of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce would go deeper into the lower levels to understand the situation and listen to the opinions of the vast number of industrialists and business people.

This morning, some delegates from Shanghai, Tianjin, Sichuan, Guangdong, and other regions continued to discuss the future efforts of industrialists and business people and other issues.

    加强工商联在社会主义改造中的作用
    全国工商联会员代表在分组讨论中提出希望和意见
    新华社14日讯　出席中华全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会的代表，今天分组讨论全国工商联的三年工作报告、三年财务报告和工商业联合会章程（草案）。
    代表们都同意三年工作报告，认为这个报告是符合实际情况的，是实事求是的。各地代表都认为在过去三年中，工商联在协助政府对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造和团结教育工商业者接受改造方面，做了不少的工作。许多代表认为工商联过去结合国家在各个时期的中心任务，进行宣传教育工作，并且组织工商业者学习理论和时事政策，对于提高他们的爱国主义觉悟和思想改造很有帮助，希望今后进一步加强学习的领导和组织工作，协助各地工商界解决学习中的一些困难问题。贵州省代表伍效高说，听了报告后，消除了工商联现在是否还有存在的必要的疑问，明确了工商联这个组织在全行业公私合营后并不是无事可做，而是有许多工作要做。
    各地代表对全国工商联工作中的缺点和今后的工作，提出了批评和建议。四川、云南、广西、福建、辽宁等省的代表指出，全国工商联过去对私营工商业比重较小的地区以及小商小贩照顾和关怀不够。上海市代表虞贤法和辽宁省代表卢广绩，希望全国工商联的工作人员多深入下层了解情况，多倾听广大工商业者的意见。
    今天上午，上海、天津、四川、广东等地区的有些代表，继续讨论了工商业者今后的努力方向等问题。
