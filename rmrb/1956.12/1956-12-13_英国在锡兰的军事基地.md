    British Military Bases in Ceylon

    After Britain occupied Ceylon in the early 19th century, it built military bases in Trincomalee and Katunayake in Ceylon.

    Trincomalee is located in eastern Ceylon. During the more than 150 years of British rule in Ceylon, Britain spent huge sums of pounds building a naval base here. The British East Indies Fleet has been stationed here for many years. It is also the location of a British naval arsenal.

    Katunayake is near Negombo in western Ceylon and is the main British air force base in Ceylon. In Puttalam, the British also had a seaplane airport for use in wartime.

    In the past, Ceylon was a stopover for British aggression in the East, and Britain had always strengthened its control over Ceylon in all aspects. On the eve of Ceylon's declaration as an autonomous dominion in November 1947, Britain and Ceylon signed a "Defense Agreement." According to this agreement, Britain had the right to use all of Ceylon's naval and air bases and ports, and Britain could station naval and air forces in Ceylon.

    Britain's practice of forcibly maintaining military bases and stationing troops in Ceylon is detrimental to Ceylon's sovereignty and independence. The Ceylonese Parliament and people have always opposed the British stationing of troops and occupation of military bases in Ceylon.

    In late June and early July this year, the Ceylon government and the British government held negotiations on this issue. Britain was forced to recognize Ceylon's rights to the Trincomalee naval base and the Katunayake air force base, but also demanded that Ceylon agree to provide the British army with facilities such as transportation, mobilization, and storage of ammunition at these bases, and that Britain expand, develop, and train the Ceylonese armed forces.

    This agreement has caused controversy among Ceylonese people. N.M. Perera, a representative of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, said after the Anglo-Ceylonese communique was issued: Before this, Britain only had uncertain and unstable rights to use the bases, but now it has obtained the legal right to use these bases according to the clearly stipulated agreement.

    In July and September of this year, the British government twice expressed its willingness to hand over the Trincomalee and Katunayake bases to the Ceylonese government. Britain also assured Ceylon that it would not use these bases even in the event of a war involving Britain. However, Britain violated its promise and used these bases during its attack on Egypt. The British cruiser "Newfoundland" refueled in Trincomalee. (Hou)

    英国在锡兰的军事基地
    十九世纪初英国占领锡兰后，在锡兰的亭可马里和卡图那雅克修筑军事基地。
    亭可马里在锡兰的东部。在英国统治锡兰的一百五十多年间，英国用了巨额英镑在这里建筑海军基地。英国的东印度洋舰队许多年来一直停泊在这里。它也是英国海军兵工厂的所在地。
    卡图那雅克在锡兰西部的尼冈坡附近，它是英国在锡兰的主要空军根据地。在普特兰，英国还有一个在战时使用的水上飞机场。
    过去，锡兰是英国侵略东方的中途站，英国一向就从各方面加强对锡兰的控制。在1947年11月锡兰宣布为自治领的前夕，英国和锡兰签订了“防御协定”。根据这个协定，英国有权使用锡兰的全部海空军基地和港口，英国可以在锡兰驻扎海空军。
    英国强行在锡兰保持军事基地和驻扎军队的做法，是损害锡兰的主权和独立的。锡兰议会和人民一向反对英国在锡兰驻军和占有军事基地。
    今年6月底7月初，锡兰政府和英国政府就这个问题进行了谈判。英国被迫承认锡兰享有亭可马里海军基地和卡图那雅克空军基地的权利，但又要锡兰同意在这些基地向英军提供交通、调动、贮存军火等便利，并由英国来扩充、发展和训练锡兰武装部队。
    这个协议引起了锡兰人士的争论。锡兰新平等社会党的代表德西尔瓦在英锡公报发表后说：在此以前英国对基地的使用只有不肯定和不稳定的权利，现在它根据明文规定的协定却获得使用这些基地的合法权利了。
    今年7月和9月，英国政府曾两次表示愿意把亭可马里和卡图那雅克基地移交给锡兰政府。英国并向锡兰保证，在一旦发生牵涉英国战争的时候，英国也不使用这些基地。但是，英国在进攻埃及期间，却又违背诺言使用了这些基地。英国巡洋舰“纽芬兰”号曾在亭可马里添过燃料。　（厚）
