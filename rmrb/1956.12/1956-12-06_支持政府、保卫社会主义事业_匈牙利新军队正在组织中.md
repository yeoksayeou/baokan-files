Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 5th. "People's Freedom" published on the 4th an interview with General Gula Usta, chairman of the Military Committee currently leading the reorganization of the Hungarian army.

　　Gula Usta first pointed out: Due to the events of October 23, the Hungarian army disintegrated. Now, it is being reorganized. In Budapest, a revolutionary security regiment has been carrying out missions for several weeks. In most of the troops stationed in the provinces, the majority of officers and soldiers are standing at their posts. In these units, commanders have organized or are organizing the work of maintaining order in cooperation with the police force and the Soviet army. The registration of army supplies and technical equipment is being carried out nationwide.

　　General Gula Usta said that 80% of the officers in the army have signed statements guaranteeing to take up arms to support the government, socialism, and the cause of the working people. Of course, there may be some elements remaining in the army to undermine the discipline and unity of the officers. It is hoped that officers loyal to the people will eliminate these elements from their ranks. Those officers who have not signed the statement have been demobilized. They have found or are looking for non-military occupations. We are doing everything possible to ensure that these officers can find the most suitable work as soon as possible.

　　Gula Usta said: This year's new recruits have not yet enlisted. The government will decide on the enlistment date and number at a later time.

　　Gula Usta also said that the new army will be smaller than the old army. Regarding the morale of the new army, we have enough well-trained commanders and excellent officers who are able to build an army capable of ensuring the order and tranquility of the country and annihilating aggressors from any direction.

　　Gula Usta finally said: We are studying ways to increase the salaries of officers, thereby ensuring that junior officers and their families can live a peaceful life. We are also considering shortening the term of service for conscripts.

    支持政府、保卫社会主义事业
　　匈牙利新军队正在组织中
    新华社布达佩斯5日电　“人民自由报”4日刊载了目前领导匈牙利军队改组工作的军事委员会主席古拉·乌斯塔将军的答记者问。
    古拉·乌斯塔首先指出：由于10月23日的事件，匈牙利军队瓦解了。现在，它正在改组中。在布达佩斯，好几个星期以来，一个革命治安团已经在执行任务。在大部分驻在外省的军队中，大多数军官和大部分士兵都站在各自的岗位上。在这些部队里，指挥官们已经组织好维持秩序的工作或者正在同警察部队和苏联军队合作之下进行这种组织工作。军队物资和技术设备的登记工作正在全国范围进行。
    古拉·乌斯塔将军说，军队中80％的军官都在声明上签了字，保证手执武器来支持政府、社会主义和劳动人民的事业。当然，可能有某些分子留在军队里是为了破坏军官们的纪律和团结。希望忠于人民的军官们将把这些分子从自己的队伍中清除出去。那些没有在声明上签字的军官已经被复员。他们已经找到或者正在寻找非军事职业。我们正在尽一切可能使这些军官能尽快地找到最适合他们的工作。
    古拉·乌斯塔说：今年的新兵还没有入伍。政府将在稍后的时间内决定入伍日期和人数。
    古拉·乌斯塔还说，新的军队将比过去的军队小一些。关于新军的士气，我们有足够的训练良好的指挥员、优秀的军官，能够建立一支有能力保证国家的秩序和安宁、歼灭来自任何方面的侵略者的军队。
    古拉·乌斯塔最后说：正在研究提高军官们的待遇，从而确保下级军官和他们的家属都可以过安宁的生活。我们也考虑要缩短义务兵的服役期限。
