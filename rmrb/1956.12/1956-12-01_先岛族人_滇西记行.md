　　The Xian Dao People
　　—Travels in Western Yunnan
　　Peng Jingfeng
　　It has been a long time since I left Yingjiang, but I often think of those Xian Dao people who live at the end of the Daying River, thinking of their lives, thinking of their health…

　　This is a nation with a pitifully small population. Currently, there are only seventeen households, a little more than seventy people, in the Yingjiang area. In the past, their population was not so sparse, but under the long-term oppression of reactionary rule and the devastation of years of disasters and diseases, they gradually declined, reaching the tragic point of near extinction. As an old man of the Xian Dao people said, "To sing of our suffering! A thousand, ten thousand songs would not be enough; to calculate the tears we have shed! They are more than the water of the Daying River!"

　　The Manmian Village where they live suffered a smallpox epidemic before liberation. Without any medicine, many of the Xian Dao people died. One day, more than forty people died. When they think of that terrible epidemic, they still shudder. They still remember that the people who died in that outbreak could not be buried in time. Sometimes, two people carried a corpse, and as they walked, the people carrying the corpse also fell down…

　　The seventy-odd people who remain are survivors of that epidemic, but nine out of ten have become pockmarked. Now, whenever medical personnel from the People's Government go to their village, they cry sadly. They say: If the Communist Party had come a few decades earlier, how wonderful that would have been!

　　Disease, poverty, and the exploitation of the rulers have caused these remaining Xian Dao people to lose their ability to cultivate the land. Among the seventeen households in the entire village, there are no domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, pigs, or horses. They only raise some dogs, using dogs for meat and to worship ghosts. Among the seventeen households, there is not a single quilt or felt blanket. In the cold nights of winter, they can only sit around the fire pit, relying on the warmth of the fire to get through the long night…

　　In order to survive, they usually can only go to the mountains to collect wild bamboo, weave bamboo strips and bamboo baskets, and sell them cheaply in the market. Their elaborately woven bamboo utensils are very popular with the Dai and Jingpo people. In the market on the left bank of the Yingjiang River, we often see their products being snapped up. This spring, the work cadre sent by the Pulun Cultural Station originally planned to organize them to establish a handicraft bamboo utensil production cooperative, but when they contacted the local trade group, the trade group refused to purchase, citing that there were no instructions from above, which forced the work of setting up the cooperative to be temporarily suspended.

　　Recently, with the relief from the People's Government, they have planted sixteen baskets of dryland grain seeds (each basket is thirty-three jin). In April of this year, when the Yingjiang County People's Congress was held, they also elected a representative named Yang Laoer to participate. The Xian Dao people were happy about this for a long time. It was the first time in history that they had participated in managing the major affairs of the government!

　　In May, at the Mountain Area Work Conference convened by the Yingjiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, while discussing and adopting the work of guiding the people in the mountainous areas to directly transition to socialism through agricultural cooperation, it also studied with great concern how to vigorously help and lead the work of these Xian Dao people. I believe that in the near future, this small nation, which is almost on the verge of extinction, will once again thrive and grow stronger.

　　I bless them!

　　先岛族人
　　——滇西记行
　　彭荆风
    离开盈江很长时间了，我还常常惦念着那些居住在大盈江尽头的先岛族人，惦记他们的生活，惦记他们的健康……。
    这是一个人数少得可怜的民族，目前，在盈江这一带只有十七户人家，七十多口人。过去，他们的人口并不是这样稀少，而是在反动统治的长期压迫和连年灾病的摧残下，才逐渐衰败下来，而达到几乎灭种的悲惨地步。这正如先岛族的老人所说的一样：“要唱我们的苦处呵！一千只、一万只歌也唱不完；要计算我们流过的眼泪呵！那比大盈江的水还要多！”
    他们居住的蛮面寨，在解放前闹过一次天花的疫病，先岛族人在没有一点医药的情况下，死了很多人，有一天就死了四十多个人。想起那次可怕的时疫，他们现在还会心寒，他们还记得：那次死的人，埋都埋不过来，有时，两个人抬一具死尸，走着，走着，抬死尸的人也倒了下去……。
    现在这七十多口人都是从那次疫病中剩下的，但，十分之九也都变成了麻脸的人。现在，每当人民政府的医务人员去到他们的寨子时，他们就会伤心地流泪，他们说：要是共产党早来十几年那多好呵！
    疾病、贫困以及统治者的压榨，已经使这些残剩的先岛族人丧失了耕种的能力，在全寨十七户人家中，没有一条牛、羊、猪、马等家畜，他们只养了一些狗，用狗来作肉食品、用狗来祭鬼。十七户人家中，也没有一条被子或毡子，十冬腊月的寒夜也只能围坐在火塘前，依靠火的温暖熬过长夜……。
    为了生活，平常他们只能到山上去采折一些野竹，编起竹篾、竹篓等器具，拿到市集上去廉价出售。那编得很精巧的竹器，很受傣族、景颇族人的喜欢，在盈江左岸的市集上，我们常可看到他们的产品被争着购买。今年春天，普仑文化站派去的工作干部，原来准备把他们组织起来建立一个手工业竹器生产合作社，但，和当地的贸易组连系时，贸易组却以上级没有这项指示为名，拒绝收购，使得筹组合作社的工作，不得不暂时停顿下来。
    最近，得到人民政府的救济，他们才种下了十六箩谷种的旱谷地
  （每箩是三十三市斤）。今年4月间，盈江县人民代表大会开会时，他们也选派了一个叫杨老二的代表去参加。先岛族人为这事高兴了很长时间，他们参加管理政府的大事，这还是有史以来第一次呢！
    5月间，中共盈江县委召开的山区工作会议上，在讨论通过农业合作化引导山区人民直接过渡到社会主义的工作的同时，也以极大的关怀，研究了如何大力帮助和领导这些先岛族人的工作。我相信，在不久的将来，这个几乎濒于灭亡境地的弱小民族，也会重新人丁兴旺地壮大起来。
    我祝福他们！
