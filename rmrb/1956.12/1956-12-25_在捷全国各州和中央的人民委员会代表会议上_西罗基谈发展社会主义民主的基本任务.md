Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 24th - Czechoslovakian Premier Viliam Široký delivered a report at the National Congress of Representatives of People's Committees from States and Central Authorities held on December 21st and 22nd.

Široký said that six months have passed since the Czechoslovak Communist Party National Congress, and the instructions put forward by the Congress regarding economic and social aspects, such as shortening working hours, reforming social insurance, increasing the minimum welfare benefits, and lowering retail prices, have been implemented. The Congress's instructions on consolidating the socialist legal system have also been carried out. A series of positive effects have been produced in terms of implementing the separation of powers and responsibilities of various ministries and further发挥ing the role of the People's Committees. For example, the number of staff in departments and other agencies leading enterprises has been reduced by more than 12,800 people.

Široký emphasized that the working people's ability to regularly, actively, and directly participate in the leadership and management of the country is precisely determined by the nature of the people's democratic state. He said that in Czechoslovakia, people's democracy has a broad class base, which is built on the social ownership of the means of production, the continuous improvement of the people's material conditions, and the broad democratic rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws.

Široký continued by saying that to effectively implement the resolutions and instructions of the Czechoslovak Communist Party National Congress, the main issue is to improve the level of leadership in economic and cultural construction based on decentralization and the more active participation of the working people in solving social problems. The recent meeting of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party reiterated the correctness of this instruction.

Široký said that the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party analyzed the current international situation and drew an important conclusion after analyzing the events that recently occurred in Poland and Hungary, which is to put forward the task of continuing to develop socialist democracy in Czechoslovakia. This is the most reliable way to consolidate the people's democratic system.

When discussing the basic tasks for developing socialist democracy in Czechoslovakia, Široký said that the primary task is to consistently implement the Leninist principle, which states that all construction issues should depend on the interests of the working people and rely on their active participation.

Secondly, it is necessary to enhance the role of the revolutionary trade union movement in Czechoslovakia's socialist construction, mainly to enhance the role of factory grassroots organizations. To enhance the role of the revolutionary trade union movement, Czechoslovakia must follow its own conditions, its own needs and experience, take into account that Czechoslovakia's industry has a highly developed level, and only on the basis of a national plan can it be further developed.

Široký said that the main issue in this regard is for trade union organizations and enterprise managers to better exercise the broad rights they possess. What we are basing here is Lenin's principle, namely: collective discussion must be carried out, and one person is responsible.

The third main task is to universally enhance the role of the elected people's representative bodies and strengthen and expand their activities. The National Assembly and the Slovak National Council should more actively develop activities in all aspects, get rid of various forms of discussing problems, and further strengthen the supervision and organizational-political work.

Široký focused on analyzing the work of the People's Committees and introducing the preparations for the People's Committee elections to be held next May.

Široký talked about the current international situation during the election preparations. He said that international imperialism is doing everything possible to intensify international tensions in order to re-ignite the "Cold War". Under these circumstances, the election of the People's Committees will be carried out under the banner of our people's struggle against the sharpening of the international situation, striving to consolidate peace and striving to ease tensions. International imperialist forces are doing everything possible to undermine the unity of socialist countries, weaken the solidarity of the socialist camp, worsen the relationship between the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union, and damage the international prestige of the Soviet Union. Recently, the enemy has also been doing everything possible to cause unrest in our republic, weaken the unity of the party, government, and people, and undermine our worker-peasant regime. In the election of the People's Committees, all the people of our country will give a firm rebuff to this conspiracy. Our people will express this firm will: to defend and continue to strengthen their socialist achievements, to defend and strengthen the unbreakable unity with their allies, especially with the Soviet Union, and to defend and continue to consolidate freedom and independence, security and peace.

    在捷全国各州和中央的人民委员会代表会议上
    西罗基谈发展社会主义民主的基本任务
    首要的任务是要使一切建设问题都取决于劳动人民的利益并且依靠劳动人民积极参加。其次是要提高革命工会运动在社会主义建设中的作用。第三是要普遍地提高人民代表机构的作用，加强和扩大它们的活动。
    新华社布拉格24日电　捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基在12月21日和22日召开的全国各州和中央的人民委员会的代表会议上作了报告。
    西罗基说，自从捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议举行以来已经有六个月了，代表会议所提出的关于经济和社会方面的指示，如缩短工作时间、改组社会保险、提高最低的优抚金、降低零售价格等已经实现了。代表会议关于巩固社会主义法制的指示也执行了。在实行各个部职权和责任的分权方面和进一步发挥人民委员会的作用方面，已经产生了一系列良好的效果。例如，领导企业的各部和其他机关的工作人员的人数已经减少了一万二千八百多人。
    西罗基强调指出，劳动人民能够经常地积极地直接参加国家的领导和管理工作，正是由于人民民主国家的本质所决定的。他说，在捷克斯洛伐克人民民主具有广泛的阶级基础，这基础是建筑在生产资料的社会所有制、人民物质条件的不断改善和为宪法和法律所保障的广泛的民主权利之上的。
    西罗基接着说，要有效地实现捷共全国代表会议的决议和指示，主要问题是要在地方分权和劳动人民更加积极参加解决社会问题的基础上，提高经济和文化建设的领导水平。捷共中央最近一次会议上重申这个指示的正确性。
    西罗基说，捷共中央分析了当前的国际情势，分析了不久前在波兰和匈牙利所发生的事件以后，得出了一个重要的结论，这就是提出了在捷克斯洛伐克继续发展社会主义民主的任务。这是巩固人民民主制度的最可靠的方法。
    西罗基在谈到在捷克斯洛伐克发展社会主义民主的基本任务时说，首要的任务是要始终如一地实现列宁主义的原则，这个原则表明，一切建设问题都应取决于劳动人民的利益并且依靠劳动人民的积极参加。
    其次是要在捷克斯洛伐克的社会主义建设中提高革命工会运动的作用，主要是提高工厂基层组织的作用。要提高革命工会运动的作用，捷克斯洛伐克必须遵从自己的条件、自己的需要和经验，考虑到捷克斯洛伐克的工业是具有高度发展的水平，并且只有在全国计划的基础上才可能得到更进一步的发展。
    西罗基说，在这方面的主要问题是工会组织方面和企业经理方面更好地行使它们拥有的广泛的权利。我们在这里所依据的是列宁的原则，即：必须进行集体讨论，而由一人负责。
    第三个主要的任务是：普遍地提高选出来的人民代表机构的作用，加强和扩大它们的活动。国民议会和斯洛伐克民族议会应当更加积极地发展各方面的活动，摆脱各种形式地讨论问题的因素，更加加强监督方面和组织—政治方面的工作。
    西罗基着重分析了人民委员会的工作和介绍了将在明年5月举行的人民委员会选举的筹备工作。
    西罗基谈到了选举筹备工作期间的当前国际局势。他说，国际帝国主义竭尽全力，想使国际紧张局势加剧，以便重新煽起“冷战”。在这种情况下，人民委员会的选举将在我国人民为反对国际局势尖锐化，争取巩固和平和争取缓和紧张局势而斗争的标志下进行。国际帝国主义势力千方百计地企图破坏社会主义国家的团结，削弱社会主义阵营团结一致，使人民民主国家和苏联之间的关系恶化，损害苏联的国际威信。近来，敌人也千方百计地力图在我们共和国引起不安，削弱党、政府和人民的团结一致以及破坏我国的工农政权。在人民委员会的选举中，我国全体人民将给予这种阴谋以坚决的反击。我国人民将表示这种坚决的意志：要保卫和继续加强自己的社会主义成果，要保卫和加强同自己的同盟者、首先是同苏联的牢不可破的团结，要保卫和继续巩固自由和独立、安全与和平。
