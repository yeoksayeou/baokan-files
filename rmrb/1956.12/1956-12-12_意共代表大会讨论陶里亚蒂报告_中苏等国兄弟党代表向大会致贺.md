Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 11th: According to TASS, the Eighth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party began discussing the report of the party's General Secretary Togliatti on the 9th.

One of the party's leaders, Sereni, focused on the party's rural work in his speech. He said that farmers are the most numerous among the working people in Italy, so they should be the working class's most important allies. The party must carry out work in the countryside. He emphasized that the importance of this work can be particularly seen from the fact that the Christian Democratic Party currently gets the most votes in rural areas.

At the evening session on the 9th, Macari, a leader of the Italian Socialist Party, addressed the Congress with a congratulatory speech. He said that the Socialists, as friends and comrades, as representatives of the workers' party who have consistently fought alongside the Communists against the reactionaries, are paying attention to the work of the Congress. He pointed out that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party are linked by a consistency of mutual interests and a common responsibility to the working people.

Ingrao, an alternate member of the leadership of the Italian Communist Party and the director of the party's newspaper, "l'Unità," then spoke, saying that the Congress was very satisfied with Macari's statement that the Socialists will always fight alongside the Communists against the reactionaries. He pointed out that the targets of the reactionaries' attacks are not only the Communists, but also the Socialists, left-wing Social Democrats, and all democratic forces who hope to change the situation in Italy.

The famous Communist scientist and professor at the University of Padua, Marchesi, criticized the position taken by some French writers in assessing the Hungarian events. He pointed out the counter-revolutionary nature of the Hungarian riots. He said that this fact cannot be concealed by any arguments.

Marchesi said, we love the Soviet Union. For Communists, everything created by the Russian workers and soldiers in October 1917 will always be sacred.

At the beginning of the evening session on the 9th, the representative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union delegation, alternate member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee Furtseva, spoke at the meeting and read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Congress.

Furtseva first extended fraternal greetings to the Congress on behalf of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. She said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people are paying close attention to the heroic struggle of the Italian Communist Party and all progressive forces in Italy for the happiness of the Italian people. We sincerely hope that your party and all Italian fighters for socialism, democracy, and peace will achieve new successes.

Furtseva praised the brilliant achievements of the Italian Communist Party in the past years. She pointed out that in the past struggles, the Italian Communist Party has made significant contributions to some extremely important tasks related to the survival and future of the entire Italian nation. At the same time, it has accumulated rich and valuable experience in mass work and strengthened its ranks organizationally and ideologically.

Furtseva particularly mentioned the work done by the Italian Communist Party in strengthening and expanding unity. She pointed out: all the achievements made by the Italian working people in fighting for and defending their own interests are inseparable from the Italian Communist Party's policy of unity. The Italian Communists have fought tenaciously and steadfastly for the united action of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. There is no doubt that united action helps to expand the influence of the two parties and greatly benefits the entire Italian workers' movement.

Furtseva said that the rich experience of the Communist Parties of Italy, France, and other countries in striving for united action in the workers' movement helps to formulate a line for developing contacts and ties between working-class parties and organizations. We hope that the views of the Communist and Socialist Parties of various countries will continue to converge, and this convergence will promote the emergence of new possibilities for expanding the unity of the working class and all working people.

Furtseva then emphasized the imperialist conspiracy to obstruct the unity of the working class and split the ranks of the working class. She said that the enemies of the working class are trying to use our party's criticism of the cult of personality to create confusion, split the ranks of the Communist Parties, and undermine their friendship and fraternal ties. However, the slander campaign of the reactionary forces did not achieve the results they expected. The Communist and Workers' Parties unanimously condemned the cult of personality, and at the same time unanimously believed that it is necessary to jointly defend the socialist world system from enemy attacks and to carry out the great achievements of the international communist movement. The recent congresses of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of France, as well as this congress of your party, have fully demonstrated their loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism.

Furtseva said that the programmatic documents being discussed by your party and the rich and profound report made by Comrade Togliatti show that the Italian Communist Party is striving to creatively study the road and form of the struggle for socialism in Italy. There is no doubt that the decisions of the Congress will lead to a new upsurge in the activities of the Italian Communist Party and in Italy's struggle for national independence and the democratic rights of the people, and for social reform.

Finally, Furtseva said that the international reactionary forces are trying by all means to weaken the forces of peace, sharpen the international situation, and thus create conditions for new military adventures. To this end, they are recreating a cold war atmosphere, organizing new "crusades" against Communist and Workers' Parties, and attempting to create divisions and confusion directly in the ranks of democratic and socialist forces. She pointed out that the failure of the counter-revolutionary adventure in Hungary has given an excuse for the current anti-communist and anti-Soviet deception and slander campaign. However, she said, this muddy torrent cannot conceal the truth about the Hungarian events.

Furtseva said that the enemies of international proletarian unity have organized anti-socialist "crusades" more than once. But each time the Communist and Workers' Parties have seen through the enemy's tricks, repelled the enemy, opportunists, and splitters, and demonstrated their political unity and unwavering loyalty to Marxist-Leninist ideology. Undoubtedly, this time, in order to respond to the enemy's conspiracy, the fraternal Communist Parties will also hold higher the glorious Marxist banner of proletarian internationalism, and will rely on their ideological unity and fraternal cooperation to unite their ranks more closely to oppose the threat of new war, safeguard the interests of the working people of their countries, and strive for the victory of the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism.

After Furtseva finished speaking, the Congress responded with a storm of prolonged applause.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 11th: According to TASS, the Eighth Congress of the Italian Communist Party continued to meet on the 10th to discuss Togliatti's report. Many delegates spoke about the land reform issue. They believe that it is necessary to strive to extend the land reform law implemented in some regions of the country to all parts of the country. They also pointed out that the struggle for land reform should be closely integrated with the overall struggle for fundamental transformation of Italy.

At the meeting on the 10th, Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, spoke and read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Congress (the full text of the speech and congratulatory message will be sent separately). The delegates to the Congress responded to Peng Zhen's speech with a storm of cheers.

Duclos, Secretary of the French Communist Party, spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party at the meeting. He pointed out that close ties have long existed between the French Communist Party and the Italian Communist Party. Duclos thanked the Italian Communists for the fraternal solidarity they expressed when the Fascists attacked the Central Committee of the French Communist Party and "l'Humanité."

    意共代表大会讨论陶里亚蒂报告
    中苏等国兄弟党代表向大会致贺
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党第八次全国代表大会9日开始讨论党的总书记陶里亚蒂的报告。
    党的领导人之一塞伦尼在发言中着重谈到了党的农村工作。他说，农民在意大利劳动人民中间人数最多，所以应当是工人阶级最主要的同盟者。党必须在农村中展开工作。他强调指出：从天主教民主党目前得选票最多的地区正是农村这一事实，特别可以看出这一工作的重要。
    在9日晚间的会议上，意大利社会党领导人员马查利向大会致贺词。他说，社会党人作为朋友和同志，作为始终不渝地同共产党人一起向反动派进行斗争的工人的党的代表，关注着代表大会的工作。他指出，社会党和共产党是以彼此利益的一致和对劳动人民的共同责任联结在一起的。
    意大利共产党领导机构候补委员、党的机关报——“团结报”社长英格拉奥接着发言说，代表大会很满意马查利所讲的这句话：社会党人将永远同共产党人一起向反动派进行斗争。他指出，反动派所进攻的目标，不仅是共产党人，而且也是社会党人、左翼社会民主党人以及一切希望改变意大利情况的民主力量。
    著名的共产党科学家、巴图亚大学教授马尔克齐在发言中批评了某些法国作家在估计匈牙利事件时所持的立场。他指出了匈牙利暴乱的反革命性质。他说，这一事实是不能用任何论断来加以掩饰的。
    马尔克齐说，我们热爱苏联。对于共产党人来说，俄国工人和士兵在1917年10月所创造的一切将永远是神圣的。
    在9日晚间会议开始的时候，苏联共产党代表团代表、苏共中央主席团候补委员福尔采娃在会上讲了话，并且宣读了苏联共产党中央委员会致代表大会的贺词。
    福尔采娃首先代表苏联共产党向大会致兄弟的祝贺。她说，苏联共产党和苏联人民十分关切地注视着意大利共产党和意大利一切进步力量为争取意大利人民的幸福而进行的英勇斗争。我们衷心地希望，你们的党和为争取社会主义、民主和和平而斗争的全体意大利战士取得新的成就。
    福尔采娃赞扬意大利共产党在过去的年代中所获得的光辉成就。她指出，在以往的斗争中，意大利共产党在关系到整个意大利民族的生存和未来的一些极为重要的任务中作出了重大的贡献，同时也积累了丰富的宝贵的群众工作经验，从组织上和思想上加强了自己的队伍。
    福尔采娃特别提到了意大利共产党在加强和扩大团结方面所作的工作。她指出：意大利劳动人民在争取和保卫自身利益方面所取得的一切成就，都是同意大利共产党的团结政策分不开的。意大利共产党人为共产党和社会党的统一行动而顽强地、坚定不移地奋斗。毫无疑问，统一行动是有助于扩大两党的影响，大大有利于整个意大利工人运动的。
    福尔采娃说，意大利、法国以及其他国家的共产党在争取工人运动统一行动方面的丰富的斗争经验，有助于制定发展工人阶级政党和组织间的接触和联系的路线。我们希望，各国共产党和社会党的观点能够继续接近，这种接近将促进出现扩大工人阶级和全体劳动人民团结的新的可能性。
    福尔采娃接着强调指出了帝国主义阻挠工人阶级团结，分裂工人阶级队伍的阴谋。她说，工人阶级的敌人企图利用我们党对个人崇拜的批评来制造混乱，分裂共产党的队伍和破坏它们之间的友谊和兄弟联系。但是，反动势力的诽谤运动并没有得到它们所期望的结果。共产党和工人党一致谴责个人崇拜，它们同时还一致认为必须共同捍卫社会主义世界体系免受敌人的攻击和开展国际共产主义运动的伟大成果。中国共产党和法国共产党最近举行的代表大会以及你们党的这次代表大会都充分地证明了对马克思列宁主义以及无产阶级国际主义原则的忠诚。
    福尔采娃说，你们党正在讨论的纲领性文件和陶里亚蒂同志所作的内容丰富和深刻的报告表明，意大利共产党力求创造性地研究在意大利为社会主义而奋斗的道路和形式的问题。毫无疑问，代表大会的决定将会导致意大利共产党的活动以及意大利争取民族独立和人民的民主权利、争取社会改革的斗争的新的高涨。
    福尔采娃最后谈到，国际反动势力力图用一切方法来削弱和平力量，促使国际局势尖锐化，从而为新的军事冒险制造条件。他们为此正在重新制造冷战气氛，组织反对共产党和工人党的新“十字军”，企图直接在民主和社会主义力量的队伍中制造分裂和混乱。她指出，匈牙利反革命冒险的失败使当前的反共、反苏的欺骗和诽谤运动有了口实。但是，她说，这种浊流掩盖不了匈牙利事件的真相。
    福尔采娃说，国际无产阶级团结的敌人不止一次地组织了反社会主义的“十字军”。但是共产党和工人党每一次都识破了敌人的花样，击退了敌人、机会主义者和分裂分子，表现了自己的政治团结和对马克思列宁主义思想的毫不动摇的忠诚。无疑，在这一次，各兄弟共产党为了回答敌人的阴谋，也将更高地举起无产阶级国际主义的光荣的马克思主义的旗帜，并且将依靠自己的思想一致和兄弟合作，更加紧密地团结自己的队伍去反对新战争威胁，维护自己国家劳动人民的利益，争取和平、民主和社会主义事业的胜利。
    福尔采娃致词完毕后，大会报以暴风雨般经久不息的掌声。
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党第八次代表大会10日继续举行会议，讨论陶里亚蒂的报告。许多代表在发言中都谈到了土地改革问题。他们认为，必须争取把在国内某些地区实行的土地改革法推广到全国各地。他们并且指出，争取土地改革的斗争应当同争取意大利根本改造的总的斗争密切结合起来。
    在10日会议上，中国共产党中央委员会政治局委员、中央书记处书记彭真讲了话，并且宣读了中国共产党中央委员会给代表大会的贺词（讲话和贺词全文另发）。大会的代表们对彭真的讲话报以暴风雨般的欢呼。
    法国共产党书记杜克洛代表法国共产党中央委员会在会上讲了话。他指出，法国共产党和意大利共产党之间老早就存在着密切的联系。杜克洛感谢意大利共产党人在法西斯分子袭击法国共产党中央委员会和“人道报”的时候所表示的兄弟声援。
