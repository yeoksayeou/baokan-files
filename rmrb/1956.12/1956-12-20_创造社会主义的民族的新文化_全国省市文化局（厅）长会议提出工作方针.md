Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The National Conference of Provincial (Autonomous Region) and Municipal Cultural Bureau (Hall) Directors, which concluded today, proposed that the guiding principle and task of cultural work for next year is: to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," to strive to create and build a new socialist national culture, to better mobilize all forces in the cultural and artistic circles, to further promote creation, to focus on running existing undertakings well, to improve the quality of work, to properly arrange cultural teams, to improve the system of cultural undertakings, and to earnestly strengthen leadership.
    The conference pointed out that several key points of cultural work next year are:
    Launch discussions on the issue of creating a new socialist national culture, and conduct further exploration, especially on the issue of inheriting national traditions. We should continue to overcome the tendency to underestimate national cultural heritage in accordance with the principles of inheriting and absorbing all beneficial cultural arts of our country's past and foreign countries, utilizing modern scientific and cultural knowledge to reorganize our excellent cultural heritage, and striving to create and build a new socialist national culture, and call on new literary and art workers to wholeheartedly study the excellent traditions of national culture and art. Vigorously overcome the tendency of dogmatism in learning from foreign advanced experience, and also prevent the tendency of national conservatism.
    Take various practical and effective measures to further promote creation and improve the quality of creation and various cultural works, such as: resolutely and correctly implementing the enterprise management of artistic undertakings; implementing a new remuneration system for contributions, trying out a performance tax system, and implementing a reward system for literary and artistic creation; strengthening research on the latest science and technology and national cultural heritage, improving the planning of topics in publishing work, establishing a contact system between publishing institutions and authors and readers; strengthening literary and artistic criticism and book reviews, and so on.
    The conference especially studied the problems in rural cultural work, and determined that the guiding principle for rural cultural undertakings in the future is: strengthen leadership, rely on the masses, improve quality, and develop steadily. The conference requested that we should help rural cultural grassroots organizations summarize experience and gradually find correct and regular organizational forms. In carrying out rural cultural work, we must fully consider the needs and practical effects of the peasant masses, give play to local characteristics and cultural activities inherent to the masses, promote folk art traditions, and support mass creation.
    In general, cultural undertakings run by the state will not be developed next year, but they should be appropriately developed in ethnic minority areas and emerging industrial bases, and cultural work in these areas should be greatly strengthened.
    The conference proposed that cultural teams should be comprehensively and properly arranged next year. In particular, further arrangements should be made for folk professional troupes and folk artists. The conference pointed out that folk professional troupes are the most capable artistic teams in the cultural contingent to go deep into the masses, connect with the masses, and directly serve workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are also the artistic force that preserves tradition most richly. Folk professional troupes must be led, cared for, and supported so that they can continuously improve politically and professionally under the leadership of the government, and strive to achieve organizational rectification within two or three years, ideologically understand the general guidelines and policies of the Party and the government, have certain repertoires professionally, and reach the general living standards of the local masses. The conference also pointed out that state-run art troupes must learn from the strengths of folk professional troupes, such as their rich national folk traditions, their in-depth connection with the masses, and their reasonable management methods. State-run troupes and folk professional troupes must strive in the same direction to become theatrical art troupes that are politically and professionally at a considerable level, good at serving the broad masses, and economically self-sufficient. Therefore, folk professional troupes will no longer be changed to "state-run" in the future.
    Efforts to train cadres and improve their level are also key tasks for next year. The conference called for the appropriate development and vigorous strengthening of cultural and artistic cadre schools and opera schools in various places, while also using various methods to train and improve in-service cadres. All types of art schools must resolutely overcome the shortcomings of education being divorced from practical needs, and gradually achieve a situation of supply meeting demand and learning matching application.
    The conference believes that to do a good job in cultural work next year, it is necessary to further implement the mass line in cultural work, strengthen the mass viewpoint of literary and art workers, advocate that literary and art workers go deep into the masses, and overcome the phenomenon of certain art groups being divorced from the masses.
    The conference believes that it is necessary to greatly strengthen the leadership in political, ideological, and policy aspects of the entire cultural work. In academic and artistic technical issues, free discussion and free competition should be fully implemented, and the enthusiasm and initiative of writers and artists should be fully utilized, avoiding administrative interference; it is necessary to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism by literary and art workers; leaders of cultural departments at all levels should strive to study their professions.
    The conference believes that it is necessary to oppose extravagance and waste, conscientiously implement streamlining and frugality, and promote a hard-working and simple style.
    This conference was convened in Beijing by the Ministry of Culture starting in early December.

    创造社会主义的民族的新文化
    全国省市文化局（厅）长会议提出工作方针
    新华社18日讯　今天结束的全国省（自治区）、市文化局（厅）长会议提出明年文化工作的方针任务是：贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”、努力创造和建设社会主义的民族的新文化的方针，更好地调动文化艺术界的一切力量，进一步繁荣创作，着重办好现有的事业，提高工作质量，妥善安排文化队伍，改进文化事业的体制，切实加强领导。
    会议指出明年文化工作的几个重点是：
    展开关于创造社会主义的民族的新文化问题的讨论，特别对继承民族传统的问题要作进一步的探讨。应该根据继承和吸收我国过去的和外国的一切有益的文化艺术、利用现代的科学文化知识来整理我国优秀的文化遗产、努力创造和建设社会主义的民族的新文化的方针，继续克服轻视民族文化遗产的倾向，号召新文艺工作者全心全意地学习民族文化艺术的优秀传统。大力克服学习外国先进经验中的教条主义倾向，也要防止民族保守主义的倾向。
    采取各种切实有效的措施，进一步繁荣创作，提高创作和各项文化工作的质量，例如：坚决和正确地实行艺术事业的企业化；实行新的稿酬制度，试行上演税制度，实行文艺创作的奖励制度；加强有关最新的科学技术和民族文化遗产的研究工作，改进出版工作中的选题计划工作，建立出版机构和作者、读者的联系制度；加强文艺批评和书报评论等等。
    会议特别研究了农村文化工作中的问题，确定今后农村文化事业的方针是：加强领导，依靠群众，提高质量，稳步发展。会议要求应该帮助农村文化基层组织总结经验，逐渐找到正确的经常的组织形式。在开展农村文化工作中要充分照顾农民群众的需要和实际效果，发挥地方特点和群众固有的文化活动形式，发扬民间艺术传统，扶持群众创作。
    国家举办的文化事业明年一般不发展，但在少数民族地区和新兴工业基地要适当发展，并且大力加强这些地区的文化工作。
    会议提出明年要全面地和妥善地安排文化队伍。特别要进一步安排民间职业剧团和民间艺人。会议指出，民间职业剧团是文化队伍中最能够深入群众、联系群众、最直接为工农兵服务的一支艺术队伍，也是保存传统最丰富的一支艺术力量。对民间职业剧团必须加以领导、关心和扶持，使它们在政府的领导下在政治上和业务上不断提高，争取在两、三年内做到组织上经过整顿，思想上领会党和政府的一般方针政策，业务上有一定的保留节目，生活上达到当地群众的一般水平。会议并且指出国营艺术团体必须学习民间职业剧团的富有民族民间传统，深入群众和合理的经营管理方法等长处。国营剧团和民间职业剧团必须向同一个方向努力，成为政治上和业务上达到相当水平的、善于为广大群众服务的、经济上能够自给的戏剧艺术团体。因此，今后民间职业剧团不再改为“国营”。
    努力培养干部和提高干部的水平也是明年的重点工作。会议要求适当发展和大力加强各地的文化艺术干部学校和戏曲学校，同时用各种办法培养和提高在职干部。各类艺术学校要坚决克服教育脱离实际需要的缺点，逐步做到供求适应、学用一致。
    会议认为做好明年的文化工作，必须在文化工作中进一步贯彻群众路线、加强文艺工作者的群众观点，提倡文艺工作者深入群众，克服某些艺术团体脱离群众的现象。
    会议认为，必须对整个文化工作极大地加强政治、思想和方针政策上的领导，在学术性问题和艺术技术问题上应该充分地实行自由讨论和自由竞赛，充分发挥作家和艺术家的积极性、主动性，避免作行政性的干涉；必须加强文艺工作者对马克思列宁主义的学习；各级文化部门的领导人员应该努力钻研业务。
    会议认为必须反对铺张浪费，认真实行精简节约，发扬艰苦朴素的作风。
    这次会议是文化部从12月上旬起在北京召开的。
