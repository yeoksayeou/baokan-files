Why Did Sickert Return from Vienna?
—Notes from a Visit to Western Hungary, Part 3
By Our Correspondent Hu Sicheng

　　Among those who fled to the West during the Hungarian incident, many were young people. And of these young people, a considerable number were driven by curiosity and deceived by credulity.

　　Sickert Laszlo was one such Hungarian youth, wanting to see the "mysterious and alluring lands of foreign countries," which were said to be like gold mines, where "work is easy and life is affluent." Thus, Sickert, who had only celebrated his twentieth birthday, embarked on an adventurous path he would never forget in his life.

　　Sickert is from Budapest and grew up there. In 1954, he graduated from a vocational school for architectural mechanics and began working as an architectural technician in Budapest. His hobby outside of study and work was wrestling, and he earned the title of a first-class wrestler.

　　Recently, like many people in Budapest, he had the opportunity to listen to broadcasts from "Radio Free Europe." From these broadcasts and rumors among friends, he got the impression that the living standard in the West was six or seven times higher than in Hungary. If a Hungarian worker's monthly salary was 1,200 forints, a worker in Western countries could earn 6,000 or 7,000 forints per month. Sickert, a young man who had never been to any foreign country and lacked life experience, repeatedly heard these things and believed them completely without thinking.

　　On November 23, Sickert and a friend set off for the Austro-Hungarian border. "Since foreign countries are good, why not go?" With this motivation, he crossed the Austro-Hungarian border and arrived in the Austrian border town of Andau.

　　He almost doubted his own eyes. He did not see the enthusiastic reception and welcome there, which was completely different from what had been previously advertised. Since he had come, he would wait and see! Sickert followed others to the Hungarian refugee camp in the city. The floors of each room in the camp were covered with hay, and many people were crowded into one room, unable to rest comfortably. That day, Sickert got bread with oil for dinner. In the evening, Sickert thought, perhaps this is just a temporary shelter, so the conditions are naturally worse. Perhaps Vienna is completely different.

　　The next day, Sickert was taken to the refugee camp in Burgendland. Here, it was also a large room covered with hay. The food was slightly better. In addition to bread, at least he could drink soup made with beans. After sleeping on the hay for two days, he started moving again.

　　This time his destination was Eisenstadt. Driven by the idea that "maybe Vienna is different," Sickert did not want to stay in the refugee camp any longer. He pretended that he had relatives in Vienna and went straight to Vienna with a friend.

　　Vienna is indeed a beautiful place, with uniquely styled buildings. Each store is decorated in a magnificent and attractive way, and the goods in the windows are dazzling. However, while admiring with wide eyes, Sickert subconsciously touched his pocket. He had no money. Although there were many goods he loved displayed in the shops, they had nothing to do with him. Wandering around the street, not even knowing which district of Vienna he had walked into, Sickert saw a person walking towards him. He approached with a forced smile to ask for directions, but as soon as he opened his mouth, he found that this person did not understand Hungarian, making him feel embarrassed.

　　Night fell on the streets of Vienna. Sickert lowered his head, looking at the tips of his toes extending step by step as he walked. Where was his destination? A shout from behind awakened Sickert's thoughts. An Austrian policeman took this street wanderer to the police station. Sickert spent his first night in Vienna at the police station.

　　The next morning, the police station released him. Sickert found himself suddenly in a predicament he had never encountered in his life! Looking around, he had no relatives or friends, no place to live, and nothing to eat. But he saw a long queue next to a building with a spire. Walking closer, he realized that the church was distributing clothes and relief money to Hungarian refugees. Sickert wanted to try, but the long queue made him lose confidence and he had to continue wandering the streets of Vienna.

　　Sickert really discovered many ordinary truths in these days. He found that the more one walks, the hungrier one becomes. To eat something to satisfy hunger, money is absolutely necessary, which is another truth. He seemed to understand these universal principles so deeply only today. What to do? He had no choice but to brazenly ask passersby for some money. To be honest, it was the first time in Sickert's life that he had reached out to people for money!

　　That night, he drank a glass of beer in a restaurant and sat on the steps all night. Many passersby glanced at him. He wondered if passersby regarded him as a vagrant, or even worse. He dared not think further...

　　Another day. He met a Hungarian athlete he had known in Budapest on the street. That person shrugged his shoulders, spread his hands, and made a strange face. Sickert knew that this person's situation was not much different from his own. Fortunately, Sickert met an old German woman who understood a little Hungarian that day. This old woman was alone and living on a pension. After chatting, the old woman saw that he was pitiful and agreed to temporarily take him into her home.

　　With a temporary place to stay, Sickert wandered the streets these days. He saw a movie theater and went up to look at the ticket price. It was marked six schillings per ticket. He remembered that in Budapest he could watch a movie for three forints. He walked past a food store, and the window showed the cheapest sausage was five schillings per 100 centimeters. He knew that this only cost two forints and seventy fillers in Budapest. The more Sickert walked, the more he felt that the prices here were not low.

　　On the morning of December 6, Sickert thought long and hard, always wanting to draw a conclusion to his actions. The encounters after crossing the Austro-Hungarian border to Vienna reappeared in his mind one by one. He thought of Budapest, which was so familiar to him, of his relatives and friends in his homeland, and of his motivation to come to the West to live a good life... But now it was impossible even to support himself, and he would have to take up more of the old woman's already meager income. Sickert felt that the conclusion had come naturally: "The West is like this, the West is like that, in the end, Hungary is good."

　　As soon as the conclusion was made, Sickert acted immediately. He boarded a transportation truck heading to the border and arrived at the border. Two Austrian border guards pointed automatic rifles at his chest, searched his whole body, and asked him sternly where he was going. Although Sickert's heart was pounding, his answer this time was clear: "Returning to Hungary, I don't like Austria."

　　Sickert has now returned to his homeland.

　　When the reporter met him, he pondered for a moment and said: "I will never forget this two-week trip to the West."

    西克特为什么从维也纳回来
    ——匈牙利西部访问记之三
    本报记者　胡思升
    在匈牙利这次事变的过程中跑到西方去的人中间，有不少是年轻人，在这些年轻人中间，有相当多的人是由于好奇心的驱使并受了轻信这个毛病的捉弄。
    西克特·拉斯罗就是这样一个匈牙利的年轻人，他想观光一下“外国神秘诱人的土地”，据说那里像黄金的矿山那样，“工作容易、生活富足”。于是，这位仅仅在世界上度过了二十次生日的西克特，就走上了他一生将不会忘怀的冒险的道路。
    西克特是布达佩斯人，也是在布达佩斯长大的。1954年，他毕业于建筑机械职业中学，并开始在布达佩斯担任建筑技术员的工作。他学习和工作之余的爱好是摔跤，并得到了一级摔跤运动员的称号。
    最近以来，像不少布达佩斯人一样，他由于偶然的机会听到了“自由欧洲”电台的广播，这些广播以及朋友间的谣传，他得到了这样一个印象：西方的生活水平比匈牙利的生活水平高六、七倍。如果一个匈牙利工人一个月的工资是一千二百福林的话，西方国家工人的工资每月可得六、七千福林。西克特，这位既没有去过任何外国、生活经历又不丰富的青年人，三番五次地听到了这些之后，他就不加思考地完全相信了这些是事实。
    11月23日，西克特同他的一个朋友就向奥匈边境出发了。“既然外国好，何乐而不去呢？”他怀着这样的动机越过了奥匈边境，到达了奥地利边境城市奥道伍。
    他简直有点怀疑起自己的眼睛来了，他在那里没有看见热情的招待和欢迎，完全不像先前人家宣传的那样。既然来了，就走着瞧吧！西克特就随着其他人到了这个城市的匈牙利难民收容营。收容营的每间屋子里的地上铺满了干草，许多人挤在一间房子里，无法舒舒服服地休息。这一天，西克特得到了带油的面包当晚饭。晚上，西克特想，也许，这里是暂时的收容所，条件当然坏些，也许，维也纳是完全另外一个样子的。
    第二天，西克特被带到布尔该让德的难民收容营。这里也是一间铺满干草的大屋子，吃的稍微好了一些，除了面包外，总算能够喝到用豆子煮的汤了。在草铺上睡了两天，又开始迁移了。
    这一次他的目的地是爱斯塔夫。在“也许维也纳是另外一个样子”的想法的驱使下，西克特不愿再在难民营呆下去，就假称自己在维也纳有亲戚，和一个朋友直奔维也纳去了。
    维也纳确是一个美丽的地方，有奇特风格的建筑，一家家的商店都装饰得富丽堂皇，十分吸引人，橱窗里的商品也是琳琅满目。但是，在张大了眼睛欣赏之余，西克特下意识地摸了摸自己的口袋，没有钱，商店里虽然陈列着许多自己心爱的货物，可是与自己毫不相干。在街上东游西荡，也不知道自己走到维也纳的那一区了，西克特看到对面走来一个人，就带着做出来的笑容迎上去问路，刚一张口，发现这个人并不懂匈牙利话，自讨了个没趣。
    夜幕降临到维也纳的街上，西克特低着头看着自己走路时一步步伸出来的脚尖，何处是自己的归宿呢？背后传来一声吆喝声惊醒了西克特的沉思，一位奥地利警察把这位街头流浪者带到警察局。西克特在维也纳的第一天晚上，就是在警察局度过的。
    次日早上，警察局把他放了出来。西克特发现自己突然处在一生中从未遇见的狼狈境地！环顾四周，举目无亲，既无栖身之处，又无果腹之物。但见前面一个尖塔的建筑物旁排了很长的队，走近去一看，才知道是教会在发给匈牙利难民衣服和救济费。西克特想上去试一试，但是这样长的排队行列使他失去了信心，不得不继续在维也纳街上流浪。
    西克特这几天真是发现了很多平凡的真理。他发现，人走路走多了，肚子就越来越饿了。要吃点东西充饥，是非要钱不可的，这又是一条真理。这些普遍的道理，他似乎到今天才懂得那么深切。怎么办呢？只好老着脸皮，向街上的行人讨几个钱用。说老实话，西克特一生中还是第一次伸手向人讨钱用呢！
    这一天晚上，他在饭馆里喝了一杯啤酒，在台阶上坐了一夜。很多过路的人都侧眼瞧着他。他怀疑是不是过路人把他当作流浪汉看待，或者甚至更坏的，他不敢再想下去了……。
    又是一天。在街上碰见了以前在布达佩斯认识的一个匈牙利的运动员。那个人耸了耸肩，把手摊开，做了一个怪脸，西克特知道，这个人的处境同自己是相差无几的。幸而，西克特这天遇见了一个懂点匈牙利文的德国老太婆。这个老太婆独自一个人，现在靠领养老金过日子，在攀谈之下，老太婆见他可怜，同意把他暂时收容在自己家里。
    暂时有了住处，这几天里，西克特就在街上游荡。看到一个电影院，上去看看票价，上面标明六先令一张，他想起在布达佩斯三个福林就能看一次电影。走过一个食品店，橱窗内标明最便宜的香肠五先令一百公分，他知道这在布达佩斯只要两个福林七十费来。西克特越走越感觉到，这儿的物价并不低。
    12月6日早晨，西克特左思右想，总想给自己的行动作个结论。从越过奥匈边境到维也纳以后的遭遇一幕幕地重现在自己的眼前。他想起了对自己那么熟悉的布达佩斯，想起了在祖国的亲友，想起了自己到西方过好生活的动机……。但是，现在连自己养活自己都不可能，还要多占老太婆本来就够清苦的收入。西克特觉得结论已经自然而然地出来了：“西方这样，西方那样，最后还是匈牙利好。”
    结论一作出，西克特马上就行动。搭上开往边境的运输汽车，西克特就到了边境。两个奥地利边防军拿着自动步枪对着他胸口一面搜查他的全身，一面厉声问他到那里去。西克特虽然心口跳个不停，但是，他这次的回答是清楚的：“回到匈牙利，我不喜欢奥地利。”
    西克特现在已经回到了自己的祖国。
    记者遇见他时，他稍微思索了一下说：“这两周的西方之行，我是永远不会忘记的。”
