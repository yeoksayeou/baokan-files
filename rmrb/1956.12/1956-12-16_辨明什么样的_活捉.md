    Discern What Kind of "Living Capture"
    Xiao Bao Lu Qi
    After reading Mr. Fu Xian's "Thinking of 'Living Capture'" in the People's Daily on November 17th, we have different opinions on the ideological content of the play "Living Capture."
    In the past, some people thought that ghost operas could not be performed, so all ghost operas were banned. Now, some people think that ghost operas can be performed, so all ghost operas can be performed regardless of what they are. This is truly going from one extreme to another, reversing back and forth, which is bewildering. In fact, to believe that ghost operas should be banned or can be performed without specific analysis of specific situations is just following the trend blindly. Here, we only want to talk about the ghost opera "Living Capture."
    Mr. Fu Xian has already said that Yan Poxi's living capture of Zhang San was not for revenge, which is very clear in the original Kunqu opera, so there is no need to elaborate. Mr. Fu Xian believes that in the original play, Yan Poxi was passionately in love with Zhang San, so she captured her beloved Zhang San alive, "to fly together and enter the underworld as a pair." This is "the playwright telling us: love is stronger than death!" Regardless of whether the playwright had this intention, it is worth studying to apply the concepts of "love is stronger than death" or "love conquers death" to Yan Poxi's "living capture" of Zhang San.
    Is the love between Yan and Zhang in their lifetime worthy of people's sympathy? Of course, we will not use the moral standards of feudal society to measure them and condemn them as the "root of all evil." But from the description in "Water Margin," it can be seen that the reason why Yan Poxi was not satisfied with Song Jiang was because Song Jiang loved practicing with weapons and did not pay attention to female beauty. Zhang Wenyuan took advantage of this situation. Yan Poxi's life experience and her desire for love are worthy of our sympathy, but the problem lies in her attitude towards Song Jiang. After Song Jiang heard about the ambiguous relationship between Yan and Zhang, he did not intend to retaliate against her, but only retreated, showing Yan Poxi the greatest tolerance; after the loss of the recruitment document bag, he followed Yan Poxi in everything, allowing her to remarry Zhang Wenyuan. However, Yan Poxi, having achieved the goal of remarrying, insisted on putting Song Jiang to death, which is hard to sympathize with.
    Since the love between Yan and Zhang in the human world does not receive our sympathy, then Yan Poxi's "living capture" after death, of course, will not receive people's approval either. The Kunqu opera "Living Capture" is in conflict with the spirit of the original "Water Margin." The love between Yan and Zhang is shameful and sinful; it cannot be said to be "stronger than death." It is obviously inappropriate to give such praise to such characters.
    Love that is stronger than death, and is also expressed through "living capture," is not non-existent. In the classical novel "Jade Guanyin" (see the Song Dynasty "Capital Popular Novels"), Xiu Xiu captures her lover Cui Ning in this way. Xiu Xiu's spirit of pursuing love and remaining steadfast after death is truly a most powerful spirit of resistance against the rulers. This kind of "living capture" is worthy of affirmation. In the play "Red Plum Pavilion," Li Huiniang still comes to meet her lover after death, which is the same spirit. Similarly, Jiao Guiying in "Living Capture of Wang Kui" still loves her lover Wang Kui after death and only "captures" him to take revenge when Wang Kui is cruel and resolutely refuses to acknowledge her. This spirit is certainly also worthy of affirmation.
    The same are ghosts, the same is "living capture," but they have different meanings.

### 辨明什么样的“活捉”

    辨明什么样的“活捉”
    晓报　卢棨
    看了11月17日人民日报上弗先先生的“想到‘活捉’”，我们对“活捉”这出戏的思想内容，有不同的意见。
    过去，有人认为鬼戏不可以演，于是鬼戏一律不演。现在，又有人认为鬼戏可演，于是不管什么鬼戏都可演了。这真是从一个极端转到另一个极端，一反一复，令人惶惑。其实，不针对具体情况作具体分析，就认为鬼戏一律不可演或一律可演，都是一窝风。这里，我们只想就“活捉”这出鬼戏来谈一谈。
    弗先先生已经说过，阎婆惜活捉张三，不是为了什么报仇，这在昆曲原戏中原很清楚，毋庸赘言。弗先先生认为原戏阎婆惜是为了热恋张三，所以活捉心爱的张三，“效于飞，双双入冥”。这是“剧作者在告诉我们：爱情比死更坚强呵！”姑不论剧作者是否有这种意思，把“爱情比死更坚强”或“爱战胜死”这些概念套用在阎婆惜“活捉”张三郎上，是值得研究的。
    阎张之间的生前的爱情能否值得人们的同情呢？我们当然不会用封建社会的道德标准来衡量他们，斥责他们为“万恶之首”。但从“水浒”的描写中，可以看出阎婆惜之所以不满意宋江，就是因为宋江爱习枪棒，不留意于女色。张文远在这种情况下钻了空子。阎婆惜的生活遭遇以及她需要爱情的心愿是能使我们同情的，但问题在于她对待宋江的态度。宋江在风闻阎张的暧昧关系以后，并没有打算报复她的意思，而只是退让，对阎婆惜尽了最大的容忍；在招文袋失落以后，件件依从阎婆惜，任凭她改嫁张文远。而阎婆惜既已达到改嫁的目的，还一定非要把宋江置之死地不可，这就很难令人同情了。
    既然阎张之间在阳间的爱情得不到我们的同情，则阎婆惜死后“活捉”一举，当然也得不到人们的赞同。昆曲“活捉”是与“水浒”原著的精神有抵触的。阎张的爱情是可耻的罪恶的，说不上“比死更坚强”，对这样的人物给予这样的歌颂显然并不得当。
    比死更坚强的爱情，而且也出之以“活捉”的并不是没有，在古典小说“碾玉观音”（见宋代“京本通俗小说”）中的秀秀就是这样来活捉她的爱人崔宁的。秀秀这种追求爱情、死而弥坚的精神实在是一种最强烈的反抗统治者的精神，这种“活捉”是值得肯定的。在戏剧中“红梅阁”中的李慧娘死后仍来与爱人欢会，也是同样的精神。再像“活捉王魁”中的敫桂英死后仍恋着爱人王魁，实在到王魁残酷无情坚决不认时才“活捉”了他报仇，这种精神当然也值得肯定。
    同样是鬼，同样是“活捉”，然而有不同的意义。
