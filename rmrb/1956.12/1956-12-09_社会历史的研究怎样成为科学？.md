How Can the Study of Social History Become a Science?

　　The "Historical Research" journal published in November 1956, featured an article by Comrade Hu Sheng titled "How Can the Study of Social History Become a Science?" This article provides a systematic analysis and critique of the various confused ideas held by modern Chinese bourgeois idealist historians regarding the question of how the study of social history can become a science.

　　The author points out that many modern Chinese bourgeois historical works attempt to answer the questions of whether history is a science and how it can become one, but they fail to provide correct answers. Several erroneous viewpoints exist in this regard.

　　One viewpoint fundamentally denies the existence of objective laws in the development of social history, and therefore denies that historical research can become a science. The historical works of Liang Qichao and He Bingsong can be taken as representatives of this view. They attribute the ultimate source of historical development to "mental power," "will," "inner motives," etc., thus denying the objective laws in historical development. The author points out that because social and historical phenomena involve the participation of conscious people, the laws of historical development are manifested through people's complex and conscious activities, making it more difficult to discover scientific laws in the field of social history. Liang Qichao and others take advantage of this difficulty, one-sidedly and excessively exaggerating the role of ideological motives in history, thereby fundamentally denying the possibility of historical research becoming a science. The author criticizes Liang Qichao and others for using the pretext that the same phenomena in social history will not recur and that natural science experiments cannot be conducted in historical research to negate the scientific laws in historical development.

　　Another viewpoint treats history as just the study of historical materials, thereby eliminating the exploration of the laws of historical development. Fu Sinian explicitly advocated this view. He believed that history does not take historical facts themselves as the object of study, but only the historical materials left by predecessors. The author points out the importance of historical material work in historical research, the correct relationship between the study of historical materials and historical research, and also points out that this practice of replacing history with the study of historical materials not only damages historical science but also leads the study of historical materials onto a wrong path. The author analyzes the proposition of "the layered creation of ancient history" put forward by Gu Jiegang. He believes that some of the work carried out by Gu Jiegang around 1925 under the name of "Discussions on Ancient History" should not be obliterated, and the so-called "doubting antiquity" spirit manifested in these works was a facet of the anti-feudal trend of thought at the time. However, in many places, historical materials and history are confused.

　　A third viewpoint is that history is a "subjective" discipline, lacking objective standards of "science." Some who hold this view faithfully engage in historical material work and adopt a pragmatic attitude in the textual research of individual historical materials and individual historical facts, but they often accept the influence of subjectivism when they must put forward fundamental views on historical development. Others openly promote subjectivism in history under the guise of emphasizing historical material work. Taking Liang Qichao and He Bingsong as examples, within the scope of discussing the issue of historical material textual research, they could confidently say some concrete things, but when it came to the interrelationships of various historical facts, they denied the objective laws of historical development. They only acknowledged various causal relationships on the premise of rejecting objective regularity. The pragmatist Hu Shi, who claimed to have a historical addiction, even openly advocated that in narrating and interpreting history, one should not rely on scientific methods, but on "imagination" and "artistic" ability to organize various historical materials into a "historical system." The author points out that this subjective method was not created solely by Chinese bourgeois historians, and in some respects, it originated from the works of European and American bourgeois idealist historical philosophy, such as those of German historian Bernheim and French historians Langlois and Seignobos.

　　The final viewpoint attempts to introduce biology into the study of social history, believing that this will lead to historical science, but in reality, it destroys historical science. Zhu Qianzhi, Chang Naide, Pan Guangdan, and others advocate this view. They promote "biological history," "organic history," and "humanistic history." The author points out that various forms of "biological history" actually only reflect the bankruptcy of historical idealism. Because the openly denied idealist viewpoint of social historical science cannot stand, they try their best to add some decorations to it in the name of biology. Because they want to make people believe that they also start from material conditions to give a scientific explanation of social history, they use the phenomena of fertility and heredity to explain social development. In their hands, biology (organicist, teleological biology) and so-called eugenics are themselves only pseudo-science, and the study of social history cannot move forward one step when combined with this pseudo-science.

　　The author provides a concrete analysis and critique of the above-mentioned erroneous viewpoints, pointing out that these erroneous viewpoints have had a very bad influence on modern Chinese historical research. At the same time, the author affirms the contributions of Chinese bourgeois history to the development of historical science. Chinese bourgeois history has made progress compared to the history of the feudal era in breaking the superstition of taking ancient times as a golden age, in expanding the field of historical research, in emphasizing the authenticity of narratives, and in increasing the importance of collecting, organizing, and researching historical materials.

　　The author concludes by explaining some basic issues of Marxist historical science. He explains the unity of the high degree of revolutionary nature and the high degree of scientific nature of Marxist historical science, as well as the significance of historical materialism as the theoretical guidance and method of historical research. The author emphasizes that some people seem to think that the task of Marxist historical research is not to provide a scientific explanation of historical events, but only to praise the forces that played a progressive role in various periods of history and oppose the forces that played a reactionary role, and that the louder the praise and the more forceful the scolding, the more the combativeness of Marxism can be shown. In fact, this view violates the spirit of seeking truth from facts in Marxism. In the preface to his book "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte," Marx criticized Hugo's book "Napoleon the Little": "Hugo only indulges in bitter and witty invective against the responsible producer of the coup d'état. The event itself appears in his work like a bolt from the blue." Hugo could not give a scientific explanation of the event; as Marx said, his description of the person he scolded instead made people feel that he was a great personality. Marx's criticism vividly demonstrates the requirement of the unity of scientific nature and revolutionary nature. (Rui)

### 社会历史的研究怎样成为科学？

　　社会历史的研究怎样成为科学？
    “历史研究”1956年11期上，发表了胡绳同志的“社会历史的研究怎样成为科学”的文章，对现代中国资产阶级唯心主义历史学在解答社会历史的研究怎样成为科学的这个问题上的各种混乱的观念，给予系统的分析和批判。
    作者指出，很多现代中国资产阶级的历史学著作试图答复历史学是不是一种科学和怎样才能成为科学的问题，但是得不到正确的答复。在这方面存在着几种错误的观点。
    一种是根本否认在社会历史的发展中有客观规律，因而否认历史研究能够成为科学，这可以拿梁启超和何炳松的史学著作作为代表。他们把历史发展的最后根源归结于“心力”、“意志”、“内心动机”等等，因而否认历史发展中的客观规律。作者指出由于社会历史现象是由有意识的人参加在内的，历史发展的规律是通过人们的错综复杂的有意识的活动而表现出来的，这就使得在社会历史领域内发现科学规律较为困难。梁启超等正是利用了这种困难，片面地极度夸大思想动机在历史上的作用，从而在根本上否认历史研究成为科学的可能。作者批判了梁启超等借口社会历史中同样现象不会反复出现和历史研究中不能做自然科学的实验工作，来否定历史发展中的科学规律的说法。
    一种是把历史学说成就是史料学，从而取消对历史发展规律的探求。明白主张这种观点的有傅斯年。他认为历史学并不是以历史事实本身为研究对象，而只是以前人留下来的史料为研究对象。文章作者指出了史料工作在历史研究中的重要性，史料学和历史研究的正确关系，同时也指出这种用史料学代替历史学的作法，既破坏了历史科学，也把史料学引导到错误的道路上去。作者对顾颉刚所提出的“层累地造成的古史”这一命题进行了分析。认为在1925年左右顾颉刚在“古史辨”的名义下进行的一些工作不应当被抹煞，在这些工作中表现着的所谓“疑古”精神是当时的反封建思潮的一个侧面。但是在许多地方，史料和历史是被混淆起来。
    一种是认为历史学乃是一种“主观”的学问，是没有客观标准的
  “科学”。持有这种观点的人有的是忠实的进行着史料工作，在个别史料和个别历史事实的考订中采取了实事求是的态度，但是他们一到必须提出对历史发展的根本看法的时候，就往往会接受主观主义的影响。有的则是在重视史料工作的掩护下公开宣传历史学上的主观主义。拿梁启超和何炳松来说，在论述史料考订问题的范围内，他们还能自信地说出些具体的东西，但是一说到各个历史事实的相互关系时，他们就否认历史发展的客观规律。他们只是在排斥客观规律性的前提下承认各种因果关系。自称有历史癖的实用主义者胡适更公然主张在叙述和解释历史时不是依靠科学方法，而是依靠“想像力”，依靠“艺术”的能力，来把各种史料组织成为
  “历史的系统”。作者指出这种主观主义方法不是中国资产阶级历史学者所独创，在某些方面渊源于德国史学家伯伦汉和法国史学家朗格诺瓦和赛诺波等欧美资产阶级唯心主义的历史哲学著作。
    最后一种观点是企图把生物学引导到社会历史的研究上来，以为这样就有了历史科学，但实际上却是破坏历史科学。主张这种观点的有朱谦之、常乃德、潘光旦等人。他们宣扬“生物史观”“生机史观”
  “人文史观”。作者指出各种不同形式的“生物史观”，其实都只是反映了历史唯心主义的破产。因为公开否认社会历史科学的唯心主义观点不能立足了，所以他们竭力用生物学的名义来给它加上一些装饰。因为想使人相信他们也是从物质条件出发来给与社会历史以科学的解释，所以他们拿生育、遗传的现象来说明社会的发展。在他们手里的生物学（生机主义的、目的论的生物学）和所谓优生学本身都只是假科学，社会历史的研究和这种假科学结合在一起是一步不能前进的。
    文章作者对上述错误观点进行了具体的分析和批判，指出这些错误观点在现代中国历史学研究工作中起了很坏的影响。同时也肯定中国资产阶级的历史学对于历史科学的发展的贡献。中国资产阶级历史学在打破把远古当成黄金时代的迷信、在扩大历史研究的领域、在注重叙述的真实性和提高对史料的收集、整理和考订工作的重视等方面是比封建时代的历史学有所进步。
    文章作者最后说明了马克思主义历史学的一些基本问题。说明了马克思主义历史学的高度的革命性和高度的科学性的统一，以及历史唯物主义作为历史研究的理论指导和方法的意义。作者强调指出，有些人好像以为，马克思主义的历史研究的任务不在于对历史事变作科学的说明，只在于歌颂在历史上各个时期起进步作用的力量，而反对起反动作用的力量，愈歌颂得响亮，愈辱骂得有劲，就愈能显出马克思主义的战斗性。实际上这种看法是违反了马克思主义的实事求是的精神的。马克思在“拿破仑第三政变记”一书的序言中批评雨果的著作“小拿破仑”说：“雨果只是对政变事件负责发动人作了一些辛辣的和诙谐的詈骂。事变本身，在他的笔下好像是晴天霹雳。”雨果不能给事变以科学的说明，像马克思所说的，他对他所詈骂的人的这种描写反而使人觉得这是个伟大的人格。马克思的这种批评，生动的表明了科学性和革命性相一致的要求。（瑞）
