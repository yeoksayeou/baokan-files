Xinhua News Agency, 21st: This year, new achievements have been made in scientific research in metal and mechanical engineering.

These two research projects were conducted by the Institute of Metal Research in Shenyang and the Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering in Changchun, both under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The Institute of Metal Research has conducted extensive research on steel ingots. The study of the effects of vacuum and gas on the structure of steel ingots has achieved satisfactory results and solved the problem of stainless steel cracking. Some steel plants have already applied the results of this research to production. The study of the source of hydrogen in open-hearth steel and the distribution of gas in steel ingots is of relatively general significance for improving the quality of steel, and the researchers have provided the research results to Anshan Iron and Steel Company for reference. The Institute of Metal Research has also established a technology for identifying inclusions in steel, and many steel plants have sent people to study. Research on metal internal friction is a relatively new field of scientific research, and the Institute of Metal Research is about to complete nine papers on metal internal friction. Through these studies, they have gained a new understanding of the relationship between changes in the internal structure of metals and their mechanical properties.

The Institute of Metal Research has identified the main causes of thin plate bonding in its research on thin plate bonding. The institute's systematic study of the processing conditions of domestic new product—resistance wire, solved the problem of resistance wire cracking during manufacturing and prolonged the service life of the resistance wire.

The Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering has recently completed research on adjusting active power according to water flow rate in automatic control. It is proposed that a device can be installed in hydropower stations built on general rivers without reservoirs or with small reservoirs, which can be used to make the most of water energy. The design data and methods for manufacturing this equipment have been submitted to relevant departments. The institute's research on the automatic control system of copying milling machines has completed the model experiment. They are further studying how to make the milling machine automatically process according to prefabricated component models. In addition, they have successfully trial-produced two magnetic element wattmeters, which are new types of equipment for long-distance measurement in power systems, which can make long-distance measurement more accurate and reliable.

The Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering also successfully trial-produced turbine blades, gear hobbing cutters, etc. using precision casting methods. The components of various complex shapes cast by this method have high precision and smoothness, and can be applied without processing or with very little processing.

In addition, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Instrument Hall successfully melted heavy flint glass and heavy barium crown glass, which are relatively difficult to melt in optical glass, this year. The quality of these two types of glass has reached international standards. The Instrument Hall has also independently designed and trial-produced a camera lens and a precision instrument indispensable for manufacturing optical instruments—a reduction-enlargement machine, its precision reaches an error of three thousandths of a millimeter.

    科学研究的新成就
    新华社21日讯　金属和机械电机方面的科学研究，今年都获得新的成果。
    这两项研究是中国科学院在沈阳的金属研究所和在长春的机械电机研究所进行的。
    金属研究所对钢锭作了多方面研究。真空和气体对钢锭结构的影响的研究已经取得满意的效果，解决了不锈钢裂纹的问题。有的钢厂已经把这项研究成果运用到生产上。平炉钢中氢气的来源以及气体在钢锭中分布情况的研究，对提高钢的质量有比较普遍的意义，研究人员已经将研究成果提供鞍山钢铁公司作参考。金属研究所还建立了鉴定钢中夹杂物的技术，许多钢厂都派人前往学习。金属内耗研究是比较新的科学研究领域，金属研究所即将完成九篇有关金属内耗的论文。通过这些研究，他们对金属内部结构变化和机械性能的关系有了新的认识。
    金属研究所对薄板粘结的研究已经找出了造成薄板粘结的主要原因。这个研究所对国内新产品——电阻丝的加工条件的系统研究，解决了电阻丝制造出来就裂的问题，并且延长了电阻丝的使用寿命。
    机械电机研究所最近在自动控制方面完成了按水流流量调节有功功率的研究工作。提出：在一般河流上建立的没有水库或水库较小的水电站内，可以安置一种设备，用它能够最充分地利用水能。制造这种设备的设计数据和方法，已经提交有关部门。这个研究所关于靠模铣床的自动控制系统的研究，已经完成了制作模型实验。他们正在进一步研究怎样使铣床可以按照预制的部件模型自动进行加工。另外，他们还试制成功两台磁性元件功率计，这是电力系统远距离测量的新型设备，可以使远距离测量更精确可靠。
    机械电机研究所还用精密铸造方法试制成功了涡轮叶片、齿轮滚刀等。用这种方法铸造各种形状复杂的部件，精确度、光洁度很高，不必加工或进行很少加工就可以应用。
    此外，中国科学院仪器馆今年熔制成功光学玻璃中比较难熔制的重火石玻璃和重钡冕玻璃，这两种玻璃的质量都达到国际标准。仪器馆还自行设计试制成功一种照相机镜头和一种制造光学仪器不可缺少的精密仪器——缩放机，它的精密度达到千分之三公厘的误差。
