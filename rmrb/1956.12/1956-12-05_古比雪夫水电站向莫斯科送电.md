　　Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station Sends Electricity to Moscow

    This dispatch from our Moscow office on the 4th: The 400,000-volt northern power transmission line from the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station to Moscow has been completed. On the evening of December 2nd, this line, which is a total of 891 kilometers long, began transmitting electricity to Moscow.

    After the northern power transmission begins, the amount of electricity sent from the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station to Moscow will increase to 900,000 kilowatts, and will eventually increase to 1.2 million kilowatts. The start of power transmission through this line marks the completion of the first phase of the unified high-voltage grid project in the European part of the Soviet Union. Construction workers are now beginning to build another 400,000-volt line, 758 kilometers long, which will connect the Ural power system with the industrial center of the Soviet Union.
