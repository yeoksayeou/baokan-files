    Correcting the Error of Punitive Measures
    Letter from the Local State-Owned Baoji City Printing Factory: The criticism of our factory in the People's Daily article "Stop Punitive Work Styles" published on November 2nd is correct. In our work, we once simply adopted the method of deducting wages for workers who violated labor regulations, while neglecting ideological education work, which was extremely wrong. We have now corrected this error.

    改正惩办主义的错误
    地方国营宝鸡市印刷厂来信：人民日报11月2日刊载“制止惩办主义作风”一文对我厂的批评是正确的。我们在工作中曾一度对违犯劳动规则的工人，单纯地采用了扣除工资的处分办法，而忽视了思想教育工作，这是十分错误的。现在我们已改正了这个错误。
