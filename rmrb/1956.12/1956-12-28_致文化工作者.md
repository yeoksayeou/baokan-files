To Cultural Workers

Another year is coming to an end. In this past year, cultural and artistic work, following in the footsteps of national construction, has also made considerable progress: it has promoted the vigorous development of literature, drama, film, music, dance, and other aspects of creation; vigorously carried out rural cultural work; greatly developed the publication and distribution of newspapers and books; resolutely banned reactionary, obscene, and absurd books; strengthened the leadership and arrangement of private folk opera troupes; and basically completed the transformation of private cultural enterprises. All of this demonstrates the tremendous enthusiasm and creativity of cultural and artistic workers in the high tide of socialist construction and socialist transformation in the motherland.

Here, we offer three suggestions for the consideration of cultural workers across the country.

First: Clarify the direction and improve quality.

For the cultural and artistic cause to achieve further prosperity, the first requirement is for cultural and artistic workers to reach a consensus on the direction of development. The recently concluded National Conference of Provincial (Autonomous Region) and Municipal Cultural Bureau (Department) Directors proposed that the guiding principle for cultural work next year is: to strive to create a socialist national new culture. How to create a socialist national new culture? This is a serious issue facing cultural workers nationwide. The fields of drama, music, film, and fine arts have already launched or are launching discussions on this issue. These discussions and debates will help people to further clarify their understanding of this direction and will help to concretely implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." As everyone knows, only in the national soil can cultural flowers with national characteristics bloom. Every nation must establish its own culture and art with national style. What Chinese cultural and artistic workers need to do their best now is to develop national culture and art on the premise of serving socialist construction. The nihilistic tendency to belittle our nation's outstanding and rich cultural heritage is still very serious, and this tendency is a great enemy to the creation of a socialist national new culture. Of course, at the same time, we must also learn and absorb everything good from foreign countries, and we must use modern cultural and scientific knowledge to sort out and study our country's rich and excellent cultural heritage. All those with more modern cultural and scientific knowledge should enthusiastically participate in the great work of sorting out and studying the cultural heritage of the motherland. The conservative tendency to refuse to absorb outstanding foreign cultures is obviously also dangerous. In the matter of learning foreign culture, we must prevent and overcome the dogmatic method of learning.

Another aspect of prospering culture and art is to make full use of the existing foundation and continuously improve quality. The issue of quality in cultural undertakings did not start this year. However, the experience and lessons of this year have once again powerfully proved that if we do not resolutely take concrete administrative measures and change certain management systems, improving quality will always be empty talk. For example, if we do not establish a reasonable system of royalties, performance taxes, and creation awards, and if we continue to maintain the unreasonable treatment of "literary and artistic grades," how can we further prosper creation? If we do not thoroughly improve the leadership methods and management systems in film production, how can we produce more and better films? If we do not rapidly improve the political and professional level of art cadres and resolutely implement the policy of enterprise management of art undertakings, how can the quality of art troupes be improved? If we do not rationally adjust and vigorously rectify publishing houses, how can we overcome the current phenomenon of book shortages and poor quality?

It can be seen that in this regard, there is indeed a lot of work that can and should be done waiting for us to do.

Second: Step out of the offices and go deep among the masses.

Cultural and artistic undertakings are inherently very popular, but in recent years, many cultural administrative leaders and art groups have gradually become reclusive and have become increasingly alienated from the masses. The Ministry of Culture has tried to change this habit this year, with leaders taking turns going down to the grassroots and sending working groups to various places to understand the situation. This is a welcome and good thing. If the leading organs do not understand the situation, or only investigate without research, and then formulate guiding principles and tasks, then trying not to commit the mistakes of subjectivism and bureaucracy is simply "climbing a tree to catch fish." For example, some people ask: Why are there so few good domestic films? Why are books published in such short supply and of such poor quality? What hardships do folk artists have? Why do drama actors have no plays to perform? What are the people satisfied with in cultural work, and what are they dissatisfied with? These are pressing issues today, and in the minds of many leaders of cultural departments, they are probably still obscure. Being high above, detached from the masses, is already a fairly serious problem in some of our cultural departments.

Going deep among the masses mainly means understanding the needs of the masses and promoting all positive factors. The construction of our new culture should fully rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, carry out cultural and artistic activities among the broad masses, and should give full play to the strength of the vast number of folk artists to enrich the cultural life of the masses.

Going deep among the masses is also the only way to understand that although cultural undertakings have made great progress, there are still many regions and departments that have been neglected or forgotten. The Ministry of Culture has decided to appropriately change the focus of development, which is completely correct. First, cadres, and second, investment, should not all be concentrated in cities (especially big cities), and should not all be concentrated in government offices. Go to the ethnic minority areas! Go to the emerging industrial and mining areas! Go to the old revolutionary base areas! Go to the mountainous areas! Let the flowers of culture and art bloom in every corner of the motherland!

Third: Promote the style of hard work and simplicity.

In recent years, while cultural and artistic undertakings have been developing rapidly, there have also been some signs of being greedy for greatness, greedy for quantity, exaggeration, and extravagance. The staffing of cultural and artistic organs and groups has grown larger and larger. It is said that the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated institutions have a total of 18,800 people. This is indeed a considerable force, but in many remote areas and grassroots units, there is a severe shortage of literary and art cadres. Cultural and artistic undertakings certainly require money, but it is truly shocking that the cost of costumes for a single play can be as high as 5,000 yuan. As for the backlog of books, the waste of paper, the waste of equipment, the high-priced purchase of unnecessary equipment, and the extravagance and waste in basic construction, much has already been revealed.

Let us recall the days when we mingled with the working people, sharing joys and sorrows! Let us recall the days when we performed plays in the mountains and ran newspapers and periodicals under the white terror! Why have some people gradually forgotten the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity in recent years? It is meaningful to think about this question. The achievements of construction and the development of undertakings can only become the spur for us to continue to advance and guard against arrogance and rashness, and there is no excuse whatsoever for us to be comfortable and lazy, squandering and wasting.

Looking back at 1956 and looking forward to 1957, we are filled with infinite excitement and confidence. Let us spend the new year diligently and make persistent efforts. The above three points are our hopes. Short words but long intentions, we are willing to work together with cultural workers across the country!

### 致文化工作者

    致文化工作者
    一年又要过去了。今年这一年，文化艺术工作跟随着国家建设的脚步，也有了相当大的发展：推动了文学、戏剧、电影、音乐、舞蹈等等方面创作的活跃；大力开展了农村文化工作；大大地发展了报刊图书的出版发行事业；坚决取缔了反动、淫秽、荒诞的书籍；加强对民间职业剧团的领导和安排；基本上完成了对私营文化企业的改造。凡此种种，都表现了文化艺术工作者在祖国社会主义建设和社会主义改造高潮中的巨大的积极性和创造性。
    在这里，我们提出三点意见，贡献于全国文化工作者之前。
    第一：明确方针，提高质量。
    文化艺术事业要取得进一步的繁荣，首先要求文化艺术工作者在发展的方针上取得一致的认识。最近结束的全国省（自治区）、市文化局（厅）长会议上，提出明年的文化工作方针是：努力创造社会主义的民族的新文化。如何创造社会主义的民族的新文化呢？这是全国文化工作者当前的严重的课题。戏剧、音乐、电影、美术等界已经或者正在展开有关这一问题的讨论。这些讨论和争论，都有助于人们对这一方针的进一步的明确认识，有助于具体贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策。大家知道，只有在民族的土壤上才能开出有民族特色的文化花朵。每个民族必需建立自己的具有民族风格的文化艺术。中国文化艺术工作者当前需要全力以赴的，就是要在为建设社会主义服务的前提下，发展民族的文化艺术。现在轻视我们民族的优秀的、丰富的文化遗产的虚无主义倾向仍然很严重，而这种倾向是创造社会主义的民族的新文化的大敌。自然，我们同时又必须学习和吸收外国的一切好的东西，必须利用现代的文化科学知识，来整理和研究我国丰富的优秀的文化遗产。凡是具有较多的现代文化科学知识的人们，都要热心地参加整理和研究祖国文化遗产的巨大工作。拒绝吸收外国优秀文化的保守主义倾向，显然也是危险的。在学习外国文化的问题上，我们必须防止和克服教条主义的学习方法。
    繁荣文化艺术的另一方面，是充分利用现有基础，不断提高质量。对文化事业提出质量问题，并不是从今年开始的。然而，今年的经验和教训又一次有力地证明：如果不坚决采取具体的行政措施和改变某些管理制度，提高质量永远是一句空话。比如，如果不建立合理的稿酬制度、上演税制度和创作奖励制度，如果继续保存不合理的“文艺级”的待遇，怎么能够进一步繁荣创作呢？如果不彻底改进电影生产中的领导方法和管理制度，怎么能使影片出得又多又好呢？如果不迅速提高艺术干部的政治水平和业务水平，不坚决执行艺术事业企业化的方针，艺术团体的质量怎么能够提高呢？如果不合理地调整和大力整顿出版社，怎么能够克服目前出书又缺又滥的现象呢？
    可见得，在这方面，确实有许多可以做、应该做的工作还等着我们去做。
    第二：走出机关，深入群众。
    文化艺术事业本是极富于群众性的，但是，近几年来，不少文化行政领导人员和艺术团体，逐渐深居简出，同群众日渐疏远了。文化部今年曾力图改变这种积习，领导人轮流到下面去，派工作组到各地去了解情况，这是值得欢迎的好事。如果领导机关不了解情况、或者只调查而不研究，便订出方针任务，那么，要想不犯主观主义和官僚主义的毛病，就简直是“缘木求鱼”了。例如，有人问：为什么好的国产片这样少？为什么书籍出得又缺又滥？民间艺人有何疾苦？戏剧演员为什么无戏可演？人民群众对文化工作究竟满意哪些，不满意哪些？这些在今天已是迫在眉睫的问题，在许多文化部门领导人心中，恐怕还是若明若暗的。高高在上，脱离群众，在我们某些文化部门，已经是相当严重的毛病了。
    深入群众，主要是了解群众需要，发扬一切积极因素。我国新文化的建设，应该充分地依靠群众的积极性和创造性，在广大群众中开展文化艺术活动；应该充分发挥广大民间艺人的力量，来丰富群众的文化生活。
    深入群众，也才能了解：文化事业虽然有很大的发展，但也仍然有许多地区、许多部门被忽略或忘却了。文化部决定适当改变发展的重点，这是完全对的。首先是干部，其次是投资，不要都集中在城市（特别是大城市）里，不要都集中在机关里。到兄弟民族区去！到新兴的工矿区去！到老根据地去！到山区去！让文化艺术的花朵在祖国的每一个角落里盛开！
    第三：发扬艰苦朴素的作风。
    近年来，文化艺术事业在飞跃发展的同时，也出现了一些贪大、贪多、浮夸、奢侈的苗头。文化艺术机关、团体的编制越滚越大。据说中央文化部及所属事业单位的人员，共达一万八千八百多人。这实在是一支相当可观的大队伍，然而在许多边远地区，基层单位，却十分缺乏文艺干部。文化艺术事业固然要用钱，然而一出戏的服装费就花掉五千元，也实在到了骇人听闻的地步。至于积压图书、浪费纸张、浪费器材、高价购置不必要的设备和基本建设中的铺张浪费，更是已经揭露不少了。
    让我们回忆一下过去同劳动人民打成一片，同甘共苦的日子吧！回忆一下在山沟里演戏，在白色恐怖下办报刊的日子吧！为什么艰苦朴素的优良传统在这些年来会被一些人逐渐遗忘了呢？想一下这个问题，是有意义的。建设的成就，事业的发展，只能成为我们不断前进、戒骄戒躁的鞭策，而没有丝毫可以作为我们安逸怠惰、挥霍浪费的任何借口。
    回顾1956，展望1957，我们充满了无限的兴奋和信心，让我们兢兢业业、再接再厉地度过新的一年。上述三点，作为我们的希望。语短心长，愿与全国文化工作者共同努力！
