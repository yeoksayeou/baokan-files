    The Yellow River is Increasingly Benefiting the People
    Guangrao and Boxing Counties in Shandong Province used to be constantly threatened by the Yellow River. After the head sluice of the Dazhangyuhang Yellow River Irrigation Area began to release water, the turbulent Yellow River water passed through the diversion gate, entered the sedimentation basin, passed through the main canal hub, and flowed slowly into the farmland through the canals. The Yellow River is increasingly benefiting the people. Photo by Tang Yongping (Draft from Dazhong Daily)

    黄河正在更多地为人民造福
    山东省广饶、博兴两县过去不断受黄水威胁。打渔张引黄灌区的渠首引黄闸开始放水以后，使波浪滔天的黄河水通过引黄闸，进入沉沙池，穿过总干枢纽，经过渠道，缓缓地流到农田里。黄河在更多地为人民造福了。　唐永平摄（大众日报社稿）
    上　过去不相信黄水会被征服的杨同合（右）和岳树声老大爷，在事实面前笑了。
    左　黄水到了杨武乡，土壤改变万物长。英培、桂祯把水提，吃上甜水喜洋洋。
