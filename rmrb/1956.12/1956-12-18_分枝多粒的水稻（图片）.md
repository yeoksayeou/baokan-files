Branched, Multi-Grain Rice

Jiang Shaofang, a worker at the botanical garden of Yulin County Normal School in Guangxi Province, has cultivated two types of branched, multi-grain rice. One type was created through sexual hybridization of early rough rice and sorghum, followed by intraspecific hybridization. The other type was created through asexual hybridization of early rough rice and corn, followed by sexual hybridization of corn and sorghum.

Jiang Shaofang is only nineteen years old this year. The branched, multi-grain rice he has cultivated has four tillers per plant, each tiller having one main ear and five or six branched ears, some even having eight or nine branched ears. Each tiller has approximately 1,000 to 1,200 grains, weighing one and two-tenths of a catty (approximately 700 grams); that is to say, one rice plant can produce four and two-tenths catties of rice. If calculated based on planting 2,000 rice plants per mu, it can yield 500 catties of rice per harvest. Here he is explaining the cultivation process to visiting students.

    分枝多粒的水稻
    广西省玉林县师范学校植物园工人蒋少芳培养出两种分枝多粒的水稻。这两种水稻的一种是用早糙水稻和高梁进行有性杂交，再经过种内杂交而成；另一种是用早糙水稻和玉米进行无性杂交，然后再进行玉米高粱的有性杂交而成。
    蒋少芳今年才十九岁。他现在所培养出来的分枝多粒水稻，一棵有四个分蘖，一个分蘖又有一个主穗和五、六个分枝穗，有的还有八、九个分枝穗；每一分蘖约有一千到一千二百粒谷，一市两重；就是说，一棵水稻能产四市两谷子；如果以一亩田种两千棵稻子计算，一次能打谷子五百斤。这是他正在给来参观的学生解释培育的经过。　新华社记者　谭志强摄
