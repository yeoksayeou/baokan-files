    A County Town "Disappeared"
    A comrade from Anshan Iron and Steel Company's wife works in Lincheng County, Hebei Province. Recently, this unit contacted the Personnel Bureau of the Hebei Provincial People's Committee, hoping to transfer this comrade and his wife to work together. However, the Personnel Bureau replied: "There is no Lincheng County in our province, please contact other provinces."
    Lincheng County is clearly on the map of Hebei Province. Has this county town disappeared? Or are the cadres of the Personnel Bureau both ignorant and irresponsible? (Qian)

    一个县城“失踪”了
    鞍山钢铁公司一个同志的爱人在河北临城县工作，最近这个单位和河北省人民委员会人事局联系，希望把这个同志和他爱人调在一起工作，但人事局回信说：“我省无临城县，请与其他省联系为盼。”
    临城县明明摆在河北省的地图上，是这个县城失踪了呢？还是人事局的干部既无知而又不负责任呢？　（谦）
