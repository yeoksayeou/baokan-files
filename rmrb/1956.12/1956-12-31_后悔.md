    Regret

    He Shucheng, a technician at the Changchun Gas Company, proposed a rationalization suggestion as early as the spring of 1954, based on a topic raised by the factory, which could reduce costs. However, at that time, the leadership believed that implementing this suggestion would be expensive and troublesome, with "many difficulties," fearing failure and wasted investment, so it was not studied and adopted. He Shucheng was even criticized for insisting on his opinion. By the fourth quarter of this year, the "old topic" was still unresolved. The company's Party organization consulted with the masses and discovered that He Shucheng's suggestion was actually completely feasible, and the "difficulties" considered two years ago were entirely solvable. This time, the company implemented He Shucheng's suggestion, investing only one thousand yuan and saving two hundred yuan in expenses every day.

    People did the math: if this suggestion had been studied and adopted promptly when it was proposed, it would have saved 180,000 yuan by now. The mistakes of predecessors are lessons for those who follow. Enterprises that have not carefully studied rationalization suggestions proposed by the masses should quickly make up for the missed lesson and not let this kind of regrettable thing happen again.

    后悔
    长春煤气公司技术员何树诚，早在1954年春天，就根据厂里提出的课题提出了一件可以降低成本的合理化建议。可是，当时领导上认为实现这个建议费钱、费事，“困难很多”，怕弄不成，浪费投资，没有研究采纳。何树诚因为坚持自己的意见还受过批评。到今年第四季度，那个“老课题”仍然没有解决。公司的党组织去同群众商量，发现何树诚的建议原来是完全行得通的，两年以前认为的“困难”也是完全可以解决的。这一次公司实行了何树诚的建议，只花了一千元投资，每天就可以节约二百元的支出。
    人们算了一笔账，如果在这项建议提出的时候，及时研究采纳，到现在已经节约了十八万元。前人之失，后人之鉴，对群众提出的合理化建议没有仔细研究的企业，赶快补补课吧，再不要发生这种叫人后悔的事了。
