    Not Knowing What Shame Is
    The Lord Privy Seal of the United Kingdom, Butler, recently announced in the House of Commons that the British government is preparing to issue medals for the shameful war of aggression against Egypt.
    There is a British saying: "Even those who are not afraid to commit crimes sometimes feel ashamed"; but, it seems that some figures in the British Conservative government do not know what shame is.
    The military adventure of aggression against Egypt launched by Britain and its partners was not only condemned by world public opinion, but also in the British Parliament there were many people who shouted "shameful" and "disgraceful" at the faces of the Conservative government officials. However, Eden and his colleagues not only did not repent of their mistakes and restrain themselves, but also wanted to issue medals to publicize their scandal! It is as if the war of aggression against Egypt brought Britain not shame, but some kind of glory.
    This is truly a case of letting others laugh and scold as they please, while I do my own shameful things.
    However, the question is whether the British invading soldiers and officers who are awarded this medal will be as comfortable as Eden and Butler and their ilk? When they wear this medal, will they not recall the Royal Army's destruction of the Suez Canal, the devastation of Port Said, and the atrocities of massacring innocent Egyptian people, and be free from guilt about this? British ordinary soldiers refused to depart for the invasion of Egypt in Cyprus, refused to carry out orders to massacre the Egyptian people in Port Said, and were overjoyed when they heard the news of the withdrawal. These soldiers will not covet this medal.
    Then, who is most suitable to be awarded it? It seems best to hang it on the chests of Eden and his colleagues, so that people can see at a glance who should be responsible for this shameful act of aggression. (Ya)

### 不知羞耻为何物

    不知羞耻为何物
    英国掌玺大臣巴特勒最近在下院宣布：英国政府准备为可耻的侵略埃及的战争颁发纪念章。
    英国有句俗话说：“即使是不怕犯罪的人有时也会害羞”；但是，看起来英国保守党政府的某些人物是不知羞耻为何物的。
    英国和它的伙伴发动的侵略埃及的军事冒险，不但遭到全世界舆论的谴责，而且就在英国议会中也不乏人对着保守党政府大员的面孔高声喊出“丢脸”、“可耻”这一类的叫骂之声。然而，艾登和他的同僚们不但不知悔祸和收敛，反而要颁发纪念章借以宣扬他们的丑行哩！好像侵略埃及的战争给英国带来的不是耻辱，而是什么光采似的。
    这真是笑骂由他笑骂，丑事我自为之。
    但是，问题是被颁发给这种纪念章的英国侵略军的士兵和军官们，是不是会像艾登、巴特勒之流那样心安理得呢？他们在佩戴着这种纪念章的时候，能够会不想起皇家军队对苏伊士运河的破坏，对塞得港的摧残，对埃及无辜人民的屠杀的种种暴行，并且对此能无疚于心吗？英国的普通士兵曾在塞浦路斯拒绝出发侵略埃及，曾在塞得港拒绝执行屠杀埃及人民的命令，并且在一听到撤军的消息，就高兴万分。这些士兵是不会希罕这种纪念章的。
    那末，把它颁发给谁最为合适呢？看起来最好还是挂在艾登和他的同僚们的胸前，来让人们一望就知道究竟是谁应该对这次可耻侵略行为负责。（亚）
