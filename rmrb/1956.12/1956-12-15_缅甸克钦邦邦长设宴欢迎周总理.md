Xinhua News Agency, Myitkyina, December 14th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage arrived in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State, by plane from Mandalay on the afternoon of the 13th. They were welcomed by U Zanhta Sin, the Chief Minister of Kachin State, U Ba Maung, the Commissioner of the Myitkyina District, and leaders of the Kachin State government.

　　After Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long reviewed the guard of honor, groups of Kachin and Burmese girls presented them with flowers.

　　As the Chinese leaders drove into the city from the airport, they were warmly welcomed by the Kachin people and other ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and Indian residents.

　　On their way from Mandalay to Myitkyina by plane, the Chinese leaders stopped at Bhamo. Most of Bhamo's 10,000 residents flocked to the streets to welcome them. Many magnificent and colorful pavilions were erected on the streets.

　　At the tea party held in Bhamo to welcome the Chinese guests, Duwa Zau Lawn, a Kachin leader and former Chief Minister of Kachin State, greeted Premier Zhou Enlai. The Premier expressed his gratitude at the tea party for the warm welcome from the people of Bhamo. He said that Bhamo is not far from Yunnan Province in China and has been a bridge for economic and cultural exchanges between China and Burma since ancient times. He expressed his confidence that this city would play an even greater role in promoting future relations between China and Burma.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Myitkyina, December 14th: U Zanhta Sin, the Chief Minister of Kachin State of Burma, said at a banquet held for Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long on the evening of December 13th: "The friendship between Burma and China will last forever and become increasingly profound."

　　In his welcoming speech, U Zanhta Sin said that Premier Zhou Enlai was the first foreign government leader to visit Myitkyina. He said he was very pleased that the leaders of Burma and China were able to visit each other to strengthen the friendship between the two countries.

　　U Zanhta Sin also spoke about the long-standing economic and cultural relations between the two neighboring countries and wished China further achievements.

　　In his reply, Premier Zhou Enlai said that although his stay in Myitkyina was short, it had made him deeply feel that the people of Myitkyina, like the people in other parts of Burma, held a deep friendship for the Chinese people. He said that the recent visit to China by the leaders of Kachin State, headed by U Zanhta Sin, had deepened the mutual friendship and understanding between Burma and China. He expressed the hope that more friends from Kachin State would visit China, where they would be received with "the same warm hospitality as relatives."

　　Zhou Enlai's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

　　Among those attending the banquet were U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, U Hla Maung, Burmese Ambassador to China, Yao Zhongming, Chinese Ambassador to Burma, as well as government officials of the Union of Burma and Kachin State and Kachin State parliamentarians.

　　After the banquet, U Zanhta Sin hung a Kachin bag and a Kachin sword on Premier Zhou Enlai's shoulders, saying: "According to Kachin customs, this bag means that you have been regarded as a member of our Kachin family, and this sword means protecting our family."

　　The bag was made of red cloth and decorated with many small silver bells, which jingled as the wearer walked. The sword had a long silver handle and silver scabbard, which were carved and inlaid with sapphires.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai also accepted ivory, like that placed in the mouth of an elephant, mounted on woolen fabric. U Zanhta Sin said that this was a precious gift from the Kachin people.

　　Vice Premier He Long and several members of the entourage also received bags and swords, and the remaining members of the entourage received bags.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai presented Chinese paintings and handicrafts to the Kachin hosts in return.

　　Earlier that afternoon, Premier Zhou Enlai and his party attended a tea party held on a lawn facing the Irrawaddy River. Many Kachin State government officials and parliamentarians attended the tea party.

　　That evening, Chief Minister U Zanhta Sin held a dance party to entertain the Chinese guests. The party was held on a lawn illuminated by colored electric lights, and the dance performances were given by Kachin, Lisu, and Shan male and female dancers wearing colorful ethnic costumes.

　　During the last of the twelve dance programs, Premier Zhou Enlai joined the group of Kachin dancers and danced with them for fifteen minutes to the beat of the gongs and drums. The dance was called "Manau." Vice Premier He Long, Chairman U Nu, Chief Minister U Zanhta Sin, Ambassador Yao Zhongming, and Ambassador U Hla Maung all joined in the dancing. They formed a large circle with a hundred Kachin dancers singing, dancing round and round.

　　Kachin male dancers wearing turbans held swords high in their hands, while female dancers wore countless silver ornaments, which rustled as they danced. Premier Zhou Enlai also held a sword and wore the red Kachin cloth bag with small silver bells that Chief Minister U Zanhta Sin had given him on his shoulder.

　　The Chinese guests were scheduled to leave Myitkyina on December 14th for the scenic Inle Lake and Taunggyi, the center of Shan State.
