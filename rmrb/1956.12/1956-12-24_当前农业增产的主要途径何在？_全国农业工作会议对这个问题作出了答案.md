Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd. The National Agricultural Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Agriculture on December 11th concluded today.

After studying and summarizing the achievements of this year's agricultural production, the conference pointed out that continuing to promote various yield-increasing measures and advanced production experiences in accordance with local conditions to increase yield per unit area is the main way to increase crop yields in the coming year and for the next few years. The conference believes that this year, various regions have done a lot of work in changing farming systems and improving farming techniques, and they have been basically successful. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Anhui provinces alone have increased grain production by 7 billion jin this year due to changes in farming systems. In terms of cotton production, this year, various regions have promoted improved varieties on a larger scale and improved farming and cultivation techniques, resulting in a leap in cotton fields with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu to 3 million mu. The conference believes that the successful experiences of various regions are very rich and must be well summarized in order to be actively promoted in areas with the same conditions; at the same time, there are also many shortcomings and errors, and the reasons should be found, lessons should be learned, and they should not be repeated.

After discussion, the conference believes that it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of prioritizing the development of grain production, while developing cotton and other cash crops, as well as animal husbandry production and sideline production, and other diverse economies in appropriate proportions. When arranging the planting area of various grain crops, the issue of forage and feed should also be considered. In areas where forage and feed are lacking, a certain amount of high-yield forage crops can be planted according to needs in a planned manner. Various regions should also make appropriate arrangements for the production of minor grains. In future agricultural production, it is also necessary to strengthen agricultural scientific research and the popularization and guidance of agricultural science and technology. For cadres at technology extension stations, various regions must attach importance to their training and education in the future so that they can better play their role in agricultural production.

Regarding the protection and development of draft animals and animal husbandry issues, in addition to preparing for further special discussions, the conference believes that the primary task at present is to ensure that draft animals have the necessary feed and to ensure that draft animals safely survive the winter. At the same time, the breeding season is approaching, and preparations must be made as soon as possible in order to breed at the right time and avoid empty pregnancies. Regarding the agricultural production and management policy in urban suburbs, in the future, the focus should be on vegetables, milk, meat, chickens, ducks, and eggs in order to supply cities with more non-staple foods.

The conference also conducted detailed discussions on the production targets for grain, cotton, and other cash crops, the development targets for pigs, and the specific yield-increasing measures related to guaranteeing the completion of these targets.

    当前农业增产的主要途径何在？
    全国农业工作会议对这个问题作出了答案
    新华社22日讯　农业部于12月11日召开的全国农业工作会议已在今日结束。
    这次会议在研究和总结了今年农业生产的成绩后指出：继续因地制宜地推行各项增产措施和推广先进的生产经验，来提高单位面积产量，是明年和今后若干年内增加农作物产量的主要途径。会议认为：今年各地在改变耕作制度和改进耕作技术方面，做了大量的工作，基本是成功的，仅江苏、浙江、福建和安徽四省今年因改变耕作制度而增产的粮食就达七十亿斤；在棉花生产方面，今年各地更大范围的推广了良种，改进了耕作和栽培技术，使每亩产量一百斤皮棉的棉田跃增到三百万亩。会议认为，各地成功的经验是很丰富的，必需很好的进行总结，以便在条件相同的地区积极加以推广；同时，也有不少缺点和错误，应该找出原因，接受教训，不再重复。
    会议在经过讨论以后，认为必须继续贯彻执行优先发展粮食生产，同时按照适当的比例发展棉花和其他经济作物以及畜牧业生产，副业生产等多种经济的方针。在安排各种粮食作物种植面积的时候，还要考虑到饲草饲料的问题，在饲草饲料缺乏的地方，可以根据需要，有计划地种植若干高产饲料作物。对小杂粮的生产，各地也要进行适当的安排。在今后的农业生产中，还必需加强对农业科学的研究和农业科学技术的普及指导工作。对于技术推广站的干部，今后各地必须重视对他们的培养教育工作，使他们在农业生产中更好地发挥作用。
    关于保护和发展耕畜问题以及畜牧业问题，除了准备再另做专门的讨论以外，会议认为，当前的首要工作是，保证耕畜有必要的饲料，保证耕畜安全过冬；同时，配种季节不久即将到来，这又必需及早做好准备工作，以便到时配种，避免空怀。对城市郊区农业生产经营方针问题，今后应以蔬菜、乳、肉、鸡、鸭和蛋类为主，以便供应城市更多的副食品。
    会议对明年粮食、棉花和其他经济作物的生产指标、猪的发展指标以及与保证完成这些指标有关的具体增产措施问题，也都进行了详细的讨论。
