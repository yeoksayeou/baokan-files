    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 10th. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage arrived in Rangoon, the capital of Burma, at 10:30 this morning after flying from Calcutta, India. They will be visiting Burma for ten days.
    As the Chinese Premier's plane, escorted by eight Burmese Air Force fighter jets, landed at Rangoon Airport, a nineteen-gun salute was fired. Thousands of people gathered at the airport cheered in unison.
    Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long were greeted by Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe and Chairman U Nu of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League when they disembarked from the plane. After being introduced to senior Burmese government officials and the generals of the three armed forces, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long inspected the guard of honor. The bands played the national anthems of China and Burma.
    Burmese children rushed forward to present piles of bouquets to the Chinese guests.
    Premier Zhou Enlai addressed the welcomers. He first expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from the Burmese government and people. He said that China and Burma had developed friendly cooperation over the past two years on the basis of the Five Principles. The two countries have also been gradually seeking reasonable solutions to certain issues left over from history between the two countries, based on the Five Principles.
    Premier Zhou said that he firmly believes that the friendly relations between China and Burma will be further consolidated on the basis of the Five Principles. He hopes that his visit will prove helpful in strengthening the friendly relations between the two countries.
    Prime Minister U Ba Swe said in his welcoming speech that he was indeed very pleased that Premier Zhou Enlai was visiting his country again.
    He continued, "I hardly need to reiterate the fact that the relations between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma have always been very friendly, and the joint statement issued by Your Excellency and my distinguished predecessor, U Nu, on June 29, 1954, has further strengthened the friendly ties between our two countries." He also said that the progress in economic and cultural relations between the two countries has been satisfactory.
    Prime Minister U Ba Swe said that Premier Zhou Enlai's visit would help strengthen the friendship between the two countries and "will give us the opportunity not only to discuss issues of common concern, but also to discuss issues related to world peace."
    On the road from the airport to the Presidential Palace, approximately 100,000 people lined the streets to welcome the Chinese Premier. Burmese and Chinese national flags fluttered along the entire ten-mile route. The welcome was most enthusiastic as the guests' cars approached the colorful arches along the road. The open cars carrying Premier Zhou Enlai, Prime Minister U Ba Swe, and Chairman U Nu paused under each arch. They were welcomed by men, women, and children standing several layers deep, singing, cheering, and scattering flower petals and fried rice. Members of the Burmese Trade Union Congress also beat drums and blew horns. In many places, dancers performed traditional dances accompanied by music to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests.
    Premier Zhou Enlai waved back with a smile to the citizens of Rangoon who warmly welcomed him. The welcoming crowd included nearly 10,000 Burmese primary school students and overseas Chinese primary school students. Most of the men wore checkered sarongs, and the girls and women wore bright red and blue sarongs and tight-fitting white blouses. Many of them held Burmese or Chinese national flags.
    The welcomers shouted slogans such as "Welcome Premier Zhou Enlai," "Long Live Mao Zedong," "Long Live President Ba U," "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship," and "Long Live World Peace." The same slogans were written on the arches.

    进一步巩固中缅友好关系
    周总理贺副总理到达仰光
    受到吴巴瑞总理吴努主席和十万市民的欢迎
    新华社仰光10日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和他们的随从人员在今天上午十时三十分从印度的加尔各答飞到缅甸首都仰光。他们将在缅甸进行为期十天的访问。
    当中国总理乘坐的飞机在缅甸空军的八架战斗机的护送下在仰光机场着陆的时候，鸣放了十九响礼炮。聚集在机场上的数以千计的人齐声欢呼。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理下飞机的时候，受到缅甸总理吴巴瑞和缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努的欢迎。在被介绍同缅甸政府的高级官员和三军的将领会见以后，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理检阅了仪仗队。乐队奏起了中国和缅甸的国歌。
    缅甸的儿童们拥向前去，把成堆的花束献给中国客人。
    周恩来总理向欢迎的人讲话。他首先对缅甸政府和人民的热烈欢迎表示感谢。他说，中缅两国在过去的两年中在五项原则的基础上发展了友好的合作。两国还根据五项原则，一直在逐步地寻求关于两国之间由于历史原因而遗留下来的某些问题的合理的解决办法。
    周总理说，他深信，中缅友好关系将在五项原则的基础上得到进一步的巩固。他希望，他的这一次访问将证明有助于加强两国的友好关系。
    吴巴瑞总理在致欢迎词的时候说，他对于周恩来总理再度访问他的国家，的确感到非常高兴。
    他接着说：“我几乎无需重述这个事实：中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦之间的关系一直是非常友好的，阁下同我的卓越的前任吴努在1954年6月29日所发表的联合声明更进一步加强了我们两国之间的友好联系。”他又说，两国之间的经济和文化方面的相互关系的进展一直是令人满意的。
    吴巴瑞总理说，周恩来总理的这一次访问将会有助于加强两国之间的友谊，并“将使我们有机会不仅能讨论共同有关的问题，而且还能讨论同世界和平有关的问题”。
    从飞机场到总统府的路上，大约有十万人夹道欢迎中国总理。在整个十英里长的路上都飘扬着缅中两国的国旗。当客人们乘坐的车子驶近路上的彩色牌楼的时候，欢迎的情况最为热烈，周恩来总理、吴巴瑞总理和吴努主席所乘的敞篷车在每一座牌楼下面都停留一下。他们受到站了好几层而且在歌唱着、欢呼着、撒着花瓣和炒米的男人、女人和儿童的欢迎。缅甸工会大会的会员们还敲着鼓吹着号。在许多地方，舞蹈家们伴随着音乐跳起民族舞蹈来欢迎中国贵宾们。
    周恩来总理笑容满面地向热情欢迎他的仰光市民挥手答礼。欢迎的人群中有将近一万名的缅甸小学生和华侨小学生。男人大都穿着格子花的纱笼，少女和妇女们穿着鲜红和蓝色的纱笼和紧身的白上衣。他们许多人手里拿着缅甸或中国的国旗。
    欢迎的人高呼“欢迎周恩来总理”“毛泽东万岁”、“巴宇总统万岁”“中缅友好万岁”“世界和平万岁”等口号。牌楼上也写着同样的标语。
