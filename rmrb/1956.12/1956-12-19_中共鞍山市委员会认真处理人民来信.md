Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 17th: The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party handled more than 1,500 letters from the people this year and received nearly 600 visits from the masses. After detailed investigation, the problems revealed and requests made in the people's letters and visits have been properly handled.

    Wang Shouyi, a draftsman from the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, once proposed a rationalization suggestion to improve the plum blossom head milling machine. However, Xu Guoyan, the secretary of the workshop's Chinese Communist Party branch, believed that Wang Shouyi made this suggestion only for personal gain to receive bonuses and wear a red flower, so he did not allow Wang Shouyi to conduct experiments for a long time. After investigation by the Municipal Committee, it was proved that the improved plum blossom head milling machine could indeed increase work efficiency by more than two times. In the second quarter of this year, Wang Shouyi was rated as an advanced producer, and branch secretary Xu Guoyan was criticized.

    Through letters and visits from the masses, many inappropriate work assignments have also been corrected. The Changwai Waterway Company, affiliated with the Anshan Metallurgical Construction General Company, assigned more than 300 skilled workers to do digging and carrying soil work for three or four years, which made these workers abandon their skills for a long time, and their lives also became difficult. These workers wrote letters asking the Municipal Committee to help solve the problem. After understanding the true situation, the Municipal Committee urged the Changwai Waterway Company to find ways to help them assign suitable jobs according to their different skills.

    Problems existing in the welfare work of employees were also resolved through letters and visits from the people. The workers in the Anshan Grain Bureau's warehouse had no place to live, and there were no bathhouses for more than 2,800 workers. After investigation by the Municipal Committee, it urged the Grain Bureau to build dormitories for the workers, and the bathhouse problem is also being solved.

    In addition, various problems such as unreasonable wages, violations of laws and disciplines, corruption and waste have been resolved through letters and visits from the people, and some of the masses have been helped to solve employment problems.

    Now, many factories, mines, and district committees in Anshan City have also set up people's visit reception rooms, preparing to further improve the work of contacting the people.

### 中共鞍山市委员会认真处理人民来信

    中共鞍山市委员会认真处理人民来信
    新华社鞍山17日电　中共鞍山市委员会今年处理了一千五百多封人民来信，接待了将近六百次人民群众的访问。对人民来信和访问中揭露的问题和提出的要求，都经过详细调查以后进行了妥善处理。
    鞍钢总机械师的制图员王守义曾经提出一项改进梅花头铣床的合理化建议。但车间的中共支部书记徐国燕却认为王守义是为了个人要领奖金和戴光荣花才提出这个建议的，很长时间不让王守义进行试验。经过市委调查以后，证明改进后的梅花头铣床确实能够提高工作效率两倍以上。在今年第二季度，王守义便被评为先进生产者，支部书记徐国燕受到了批评。
    通过人民群众来信和访问，也纠正了许多工作分配不适当的情况。鞍山冶金建筑总公司所属厂外水道公司，分配三百多名有技术的工人干了三、四年挖土、抬土工作，使这些工人长期荒废了他们的技能，生活也发生困难。这些工人写信要求市委帮助解决。市委了解真实情况后，督促厂外水道公司，设法帮助他们按照各人不同技能分配了合适的工作。
    通过人民来信和来访还解决了职工福利工作中存在的问题。鞍山市粮食局仓库的工人没有住宿地方，二千八百多名工人没有一个澡塘。市委调查以后，督促粮食局修盖了工人宿舍，澡塘问题也正在设法解决。
    此外，通过人民来信和访问还解决了工资不合理、违法乱纪、贪污浪费等各种问题，并帮助一部分群众解决了就业问题。
    现在鞍山市不少工厂矿山和区委也都设立了人民访问接待室，准备进一步改进和人民联系的工作。
