    Mangshi is Waiting for You, Friends!
    By our reporters Qin Junguang and Zhang Jiechun
    The Sino-Burmese border people's joint celebration meeting is about to begin here. The whole of Mangshi presents a festive scene. At the intersection leading to Wanting, a tall red paifang (ceremonial archway) has been erected, topped with ten bright red flags. The entire paifang is decorated simply yet beautifully. Currently, workers are busy putting the finishing touches. On the sides of the paifang, two red slogan towers and a huge painting of a dove of peace have been erected. The slogan towers are inscribed with "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship" and "Long Live World Peace." Many government offices and schools have also erected colorful arches and pine and cypress decorated archways in front of their buildings. Hundreds of red flags flutter along the wide roads. Around the pool and beside the flat square, banana trees, papayas, mangoes, and various kinds of trees have been planted. In the exhibition hall, people are busy labeling the final exhibits with descriptions in Chinese, Dai, and Jingpo. Employees of the commercial sector are also displaying tens of thousands of varieties of goods, including various ethnic costumes and silk flowers beloved by Dai girls. Every street and alley has been thoroughly cleaned, and every household has swept its doorstep clean. To prevent dust from flying on the roads, residents sprinkle water on the streets several times a day. Students also use their spare time to tidy up the campus.
    Everyone is enthusiastically preparing to welcome guests from Burma. These days, the streets are bustling, as lively as a market day. Wherever you go, you hear people spreading the good news of the upcoming Sino-Burmese border people's joint celebration meeting. Girls are busy preparing festive clothes. Some Dai people are busy husking rice, preparing to receive friends and relatives from Burma. An art troupe of nearly four hundred people is stepping up rehearsals of various exciting programs, preparing to perform for the joint celebration meeting.
    At night, Mangshi appears like scattered starlight from a distance. Rows of streetlights illuminate the several clean streets, and milky white light radiates from every window. A red star lamp hangs high in front of the Autonomous Prefecture government building. The shadows of dragon bamboo sway slightly in the hazy moonlight, and the breeze carries bursts of joyful singing. People are still as enthusiastically busy as during the day, preparing for the imminent arrival of Burmese guests; it is unknown how many nights this has been going on.
    People from the Gaoligong Mountains to both banks of the Nujiang River are rushing to Mangshi to participate in the grand gathering. They have put on festive costumes according to their ethnic customs and brought the most beloved traditional programs of their respective ethnic groups. Dai farmer Mo Si told us that he felt indescribably excited to be able to come and participate in this joint celebration meeting. His wife had been busy for several days dressing him up, washing his clothes and bedding thoroughly. When the Jingpo people of Lianshan County heard the news of the joint celebration meeting, so many people requested to participate. Public figures from the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, the Lancang Lahu Autonomous Prefecture, the Lincang Special District, the Lijiang Special District, and Ximeng will all arrive in Mangshi within a day or two. Whether they are Dai, Jingpo, Kawa, or Lisu, or other ethnic groups participating in the meeting, they all have a common wish: to make the flowers of friendship bloom more brightly and luxuriantly day by day.

    芒市在等待您，朋友！
    本报记者　秦军光　章皆淳
    中缅两国边境人民联欢大会就要在这里开始了。整个芒市呈现着一片节日景象。在通向畹町的路口上，矗立起了一座高大的红牌楼，上面插着十面鲜艳的红旗，整个牌楼装置得非常朴素而美丽。现在，工人们正在忙着进行最后的修饰工作。牌楼的侧面，立起了两个红色的标语塔和一幅巨大的和平鸽。标语塔上写着“中缅友好万岁”、“世界和平万岁”。许多机关、学校门前也搭起了彩门和松柏牌坊。宽阔的大路上，飘扬着数百面红旗。在水池周围和平坦的广场旁边，种上了芭蕉、木瓜、芒果和各种林木。在展览馆中，人们正在忙着用汉、傣、景颇三种文字给最后布置出来的展览品标上说明。商业部门的职工也正在陈设着上万个花色品种的商品，其中包括各种民族服装和傣族姑娘喜爱的绢花。各条大街和小巷，早已打扫得干干净净，家家户户的门庭都已清扫一新。为了不让尘土在道路上飞扬，居民们一天几次地在街道上洒水。学生们也都利用课余时间整理校园。
    大家都在热情地准备迎接缅甸的客人。这些天来，街道上熙熙攘攘，每天都像赶街一样热闹。无论走到哪里，到处都听到人们在传告即将召开的中缅两国边境人民联欢大会的喜讯。姑娘们在忙着准备节日的衣服。有的傣族群众正忙着舂米，准备接待从缅甸来的朋友和亲戚。由近四百人组成的文艺大队在加紧排练各种精彩节目，准备为联欢大会演出。
    入夜，远望芒市，有如星光点点。一排排路灯照耀在几条整洁的街道上，从各个窗口里发射出乳白色的灯光。自治州政府大楼前高挂着一颗红星灯。龙竹的暗影在月色朦胧中微微摆动，和风送来了阵阵欢乐的歌声。人们仍然和白天一样，热情地为缅甸客人的即将到来而忙碌着，算来这已经不知道是第几个夜晚了。
    从高黎贡山到怒江两岸都有赶来芒市参加盛会的人，他们按照本民族的习惯，穿上了节日服装，带来了各民族最喜爱的传统节目，傣族农民莫思告诉我们说：能够赶来参加这次联欢大会，感到有说不出的兴奋。他的妻子为了打扮他，忙了好几天，衣服、被子都洗得干干净净的。莲山县的景颇族群众，当他们知道开联欢大会的消息后，多少人都要求来参加。西双版纳傣族自治州、怒江傈僳族自治区、澜沧拉祜族自治区、临沧专区、丽江专区和西盟的各民族公众领袖人物，一两天内，他们都将到达芒市。不论是傣族，是景颇族、佧佤族还是傈僳族，以及来参加大会的其他各个民族，他们都有一个共同的愿望，就是要让这友谊的花朵，一天比一天开得更鲜艳、更繁盛。
