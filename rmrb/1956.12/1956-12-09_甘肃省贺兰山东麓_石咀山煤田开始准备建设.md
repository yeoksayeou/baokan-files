Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 8th: Preparations for constructing a base have begun at the newly discovered Shizuishan Coalfield in northeastern Gansu Province.

Currently, over 21,000 square meters of permanent housing have been built on the coalfield's sandy area, and a small power plant is under construction. Banks, post and telecommunications offices, trading companies, and cooperatives serving the exploration and construction workers have also successively established business departments since April of this year.

Half a year ago, this was a desolate and uninhabited mountain area, but now it has developed into a small town with a population of over one thousand.

The Shizuishan Coalfield is located at the southwestern region of Zhuozi Mountain in the Helan Mountains foothills and the E'tuokeqi Banner of the Yikezhao League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It is surrounded by several large coalfields, including Zhuozi Mountain and Helan Mountain, with a coal-bearing area stretching over 330 square kilometers. Preliminary estimates put the total coal reserves at over 8 billion tons, which is 3 billion tons more than the known reserves of the Weibei Coalfield in Shaanxi.

Because of the rich coal reserves and the fact that the coal quality can not only meet the needs of general industry and civilian use but can also be used to make coke, the Ministry of Coal Industry has decided to build a huge coal base on these coalfields.

Shizuishan is the first coalfield to be developed. According to preliminary plans, this coalfield will be divided into three mining areas for extraction. Each pair of coal mines will be a large-scale coal mine with an annual output of more than one million tons. Currently, drilling workers are intensifying their detailed investigation of the coal seam's geological conditions. The plan is to submit the well construction design data in the second quarter of next year and start construction in 1958, in order to meet the coal needs of the two major cities of Lanzhou and Baotou and railway transportation as soon as possible. The Xi'an Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry has established a preparatory organization for the construction of this coal mine and has begun planning the construction of a power grid, highway trunk lines, and a branch line connecting to the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway within the mining area.

### 甘肃省贺兰山东麓　石咀山煤田开始准备建设

    甘肃省贺兰山东麓
　　石咀山煤田开始准备建设
    新华社西安8日电　在甘肃省东北部新发现的石咀山煤田上，已经开始建设基地的准备工作。
    现在，煤田的沙滩上已经盖起二万一千多平方公尺的永久性房屋，一座小型发电厂正在建设。为勘探和基本建设职工服务的银行、邮电所、贸易公司和合作社，也在今年4月份先后设立了营业部。
    半年以前这里还是一片荒无人烟的山野，现在已经发展成为一千多人居住的小城镇了。
    石咀山煤田位于贺兰山东麓和内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟鄂托克旗的桌子山西南地区。它的周围毗连着桌子山、贺兰山等几个大煤田，藏煤地带绵延三百三十多平方公里，初步估计总储煤量达八十多亿吨，比陕西渭北煤田已知储量还多三十亿吨。
    煤炭工业部因为这里煤藏丰富，煤质不但可以供给一般工业需用和民用，还可炼成焦炭，决定在这几个煤田上建设一个巨大的煤炭基地。
    石咀山是最先开发的一个煤田。根据初步规划，这个煤田将分为三个井田来开采，每对煤井都是年产一百多万吨的大型煤矿。现在，钻探工人正在加紧精查煤层地质情况，计划明年第二季度便提出建井设计资料，在1958年开始建设，以便尽早地满足兰州、包头两大城市和铁路交通用煤的需要。煤炭工业部西安管理局已经成立了建设这个煤矿的筹备机构，开始筹划建设矿区内电力网，公路干线，和接通包兰铁路的支线。
