Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 1st - Hungarian citizens who were coerced and deceived into fleeing to Austria during the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion are returning to their homeland one after another.

The National Police Bureau of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government has established reception stations in Győr, Szombathely, Zalaegerszeg, and other places to receive these returning people who are returning to the embrace of their motherland in increasing numbers. The reception stations provide them with free food and accommodation, and help them return home within forty-eight hours.

Hungarians who were coerced abroad by fascist bandits and deceived by the propaganda of the "Free Europe" radio station are in a very difficult situation in Austria. They live like prisoners in refugee camps set up by the Austrian authorities, and many people are stranded on the streets, living in abandoned train carriages, sheds, and other places that are uninhabitable in winter. Some agents of Western countries take advantage of the difficult situation of these Hungarians, recruiting mercenaries in the refugee camps or enticing them to engage in the most arduous slave labor.

It is worth noting that the US and British intelligence agencies are even plotting to coerce Hungarians into serving as special agents and betraying their country.

Under these terrible circumstances, more and more Hungarians are leaving the refugee camps set up by the Austrian authorities. An Austrian official spokesman said at a press conference in Salzburg that forty Hungarian refugees living in the Zitzenheim reception center had expressed their desire to return to their homeland, and twenty-eight of them had already left the reception center.

    看破骗局　回头是岸
　　逃亡奥地利的匈牙利公民纷纷返国
    据新华社布达佩斯1日电　在匈牙利反革命叛乱期间被胁迫和受欺骗到奥地利去的匈牙利公民，正陆续返回他们的祖国。
    匈牙利工农革命政府全国警察局已经在吉厄尔、松巴西里、佐洛埃格赛格等地设立招待站，接待这些越来越多的重回祖国怀抱的归来者。招待站免费供给他们食物和住所，并且在四十八小时之内帮助把他们送回家去。
    被法西斯匪徒胁迫和受“自由欧洲”电台欺骗宣传到国外去的匈牙利人，在奥地利的处境非常困难。他们像犯人似的住在奥地利当局所设的难民营里，有许多人流落在街头，住在废弃的火车车厢、草棚和其它冬天无法栖身的地方。而某些西方国家的代理人就利用这些匈牙利人的困难处境，在难民营里招募雇佣兵或者诱骗他们去从事最繁重的奴隶劳动。
    值得注意的是，美国和英国的间谍机关竟阴谋胁迫匈牙利人充当特务，背叛他们的祖国。
    在这种恶劣的遭遇下，离开奥地利当局所设的难民营的匈牙利人越来越多。奥地利官方发言人在萨尔斯堡举行的记者招待会上说，住在齐岑赫姆收容所的四十个匈牙利难民表示希望返回祖国，已经有二十八个人离开了收容所。
