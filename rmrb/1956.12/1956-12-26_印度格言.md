    Understanding is a fortress capable of resisting all surprises,
    A fortress that cannot be destroyed by the enemy.
    Rushing headlong into danger is utter folly;
    Fearing what should be feared is the mark of the wise.
    No one can defeat the person who can
    Maintain friendship with those who constantly criticize him.
    To act only after careful consideration,
    And to act while thinking, "I'll consider it later,"
    Is the way of fools.
    Wise people do not get angry on the spot,
    They restrain themselves and choose the appropriate time.
                      Translated by Jiuquan

    印度格言
    理解是能够抵抗一切惊奇的堡垒，
    这个堡垒不是敌人所能够摧毁。
    不顾一切向危险冲去，是愚不可及的；
    恐惧那应该恐惧的，才是智者。
    谁也不能击败那能够同
    经常责备他的人保持友谊的人。
    深思熟虑之后再采取行动，
    一面做一面心里说：以后再思
    考吧，这是愚人的行径。
    聪明人不会当场发怒，
    他们会克制自己而选择适当的时机。
                      酒泉译
