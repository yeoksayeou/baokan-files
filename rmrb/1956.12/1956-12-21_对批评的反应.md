Reactions to Criticism

    Improving Transportation Work
    Letter from the Changzhi Branch of the Transportation Bureau of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Transportation: The "Disputes on the Handan-Changzhi Highway" published in the People's Daily on October 13 criticized us for having departmentalism. This criticism is correct. In order to thoroughly improve the transportation on the Handan-Changzhi Highway, we are determined to correct our past mistakes and shortcomings, and suggest that the higher-level leading organs adjust the transportation ratio between Hebei and Shanxi provinces, and instruct the local Party and government to strengthen the leadership of transportation work and conduct regular inspections and supervision.

    Technical Personnel's Rest Time Resolved
    Letter from Fuxin Mining Bureau: The criticism of our bureau in the article "Cherish the Time of Engineering and Technical Personnel" published in the People's Daily on September 9 is correct. Now we have arranged their work and rest time according to the characteristics of the work of engineering and technical personnel.

    Letter from the General Office of Benxi Mining Bureau: After the People's Daily criticized Caitun Mine on September 9 for not cherishing the time of engineering and technical personnel, our bureau has begun to help the mine improve its leadership methods and minimize unnecessary meetings to ensure the work, rest, and study time of engineering and technical personnel.
