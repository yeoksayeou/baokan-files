    Reaction to Criticism
    After the People's Daily published the criticism "There is rice in the chaff, insects in the granary, and grain sales are not handled according to the system" on November 19th, third edition, all thirteen comrades in our grain station, in addition to expressing gratitude to the author Comrade Zhou Xiulin, have further examined our work. The main reasons for these serious problems are our weak political and ideological leadership, the lack of criticism and self-criticism in normal times, our failure to seriously study and implement the instructions of higher authorities, our failure to actively seek the leadership and support of the local Party and government, and insufficient attention to professional studies. In the future, we will improve enterprise management and make up for past losses.

    对批评的反应
    人民日报11月19日第三版刊登了“糠里有米，仓里有虫，销粮不按制度办事”的批评后，我们粮站十三位同志除对作者周秀林同志表示感谢外，已对工作进一步作了检查。所以产生这些严重的问题，主要是我们政治思想领导薄弱，平时缺乏批评与自我批评，对上级指示不认真研究执行，也不主动争取当地党和政府的领导和支持，对业务学习也不够。今后我们要改善企业管理，弥补过去的损失。
