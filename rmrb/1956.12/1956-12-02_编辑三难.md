　　The Editor's Three Difficulties

　　Rejecting Manuscripts is Difficult:
　　The author is young and full of new strength,
　　Yet the work is not published; the old masters are blind!
　　You say the quality is poor, I say it's a flower,
　　Publish it, and we're friends; don't publish, and we're enemies!

　　Reading Manuscripts is Difficult:
　　The phone rings, the editor sighs:
　　"The manuscript arrived yesterday; why the urgent reminders?"

　　Editing Manuscripts is Difficult:
　　When sentences are awkward,
　　The editor moves the red pen,
　　Suddenly, a lesson comes:
　　"You need to learn from Kuang Zhong!"

　　编辑三难
　  退稿难本人很年青，力量是新生，竟然不发表，老爷无眼睛！你说质量差，我说是朵花，发表是朋友，不发成冤家！
　  看稿难电话铃声寂编辑长叹息：“昨天稿才到，相催何太急？”
　  改稿难文句有不通，编辑红笔动，忽然教训来：“你要学况钟！”
