Parboiled rice (white rice made by steaming paddy, drying it, and then processing it) is the most rational food in the world. In recent years, the Soviet Union has been vigorously promoting this kind of grain; countries that mainly eat rice, such as India, almost all eat this kind of rice. In some parts of some provinces in China, there is a tradition of parboiling. As a medical worker, and because my hometown is in Zhejiang, where parboiling is relatively developed, I have a responsibility to say a few words about promoting parboiled rice.

Parboiled Rice and People's Health

The most significant effect of parboiled rice on people's health is in preventing beriberi. Sun Simiao, a great physician of the Tang Dynasty, used rice bran porridge to treat beriberi. Later, the method of treating with rice bran was further developed into parboiling. Because during the soaking and steaming of paddy, the Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, niacin, inorganic salts, etc., contained in the bran, germ, and husk dissolve in water and penetrate into the rice kernel, its nutrient content is greatly increased. Moreover, it is not easily lost due to milling or washing. In 1954, the Central Ministry of Food conducted dozens of repeated large-scale trials in a certain place, proving that the Vitamin B1 content of Xiaozhan rice was 0.080 mg before steaming and 0.224 mg after steaming; late indica rice was 0.044 mg before steaming and 0.208 mg after steaming. There are more foreign documents on this. According to Swaminathan's experiment, the Vitamin B1 content of parboiled white rice after washing is four to five times higher than that of raw white rice after washing; the Vitamin B1 content of rice cooked with this kind of rice is also three to four times higher than that of raw white rice. Regular consumption of this kind of rice can prevent beriberi, heart dysfunction, polyneuritis and other diseases.

There are many beriberi patients in southern China, and the mortality rate is high. However, there are very few beriberi patients in areas where parboiled rice is consumed. According to a survey: In 1950, there were 671 beriberi patients in Qu County, western Zhejiang, while there were only 6 patients in Changxing County, which consumes parboiled rice, and no one in Wuxing County. This is a very realistic comparison. Now, although medicine is developed and the sanitary environment has improved, the treatment of beriberi is not a big problem, but it has not been eliminated. For example, Shanghai's health and medical equipment is relatively complete in the country. From January to May 1953, 2,765 beriberi patients in the city were treated in public and private hospitals. The Chinese people usually do not regard this disease as serious, and they are unwilling to seek medical treatment until the symptoms are obvious, so it is estimated that the number of untreated beriberi patients in Shanghai greatly exceeds this number.

In recent years, although people's living standards have generally improved, they have not yet improved to an ideal level. According to the nutritional status survey of schools, construction sites and people in remote areas by the central health research department, vitamin B2 deficiency is quite common. A professor at Tsinghua University said that more than 50% of students in schools now have vitamin deficiency. In the past few years, a considerable number of people have left their jobs or studies for recuperation due to illness. I believe that instead of caring and taking care of people after the fact, the state should further pay attention to improvement beforehand. That is to say, reforming staple foods and vigorously promoting parboiled rice is one of the effective ways to increase nutrition. This does not cost money and can lead people to a healthy life. Why not do it?

Parboiled Rice and the National Economy

Parboiled rice has tremendous economic value. Steamed paddy generally produces 20% to 30% more cooked rice than unsteamed rice. Some ancient documents in Zhejiang record that farmers worked hard all day long and were not full even after eating two liters of white rice a day. After eating parboiled rice, one liter was enough. Someone experimented at the Huzhou Grain Company. Each catty of parboiled rice can produce 0.48 catties more cooked rice than each catty of medium white rice, and each person can save 2.72 taels of rice per meal. The life experience of the people in Sian District, Changxing County, proves that with the same catty of rice, white japonica rice yields less than two catties of cooked rice, while parboiled rice yields three catties to two catties and fourteen taels. A family of five can save two dan and several dou of rice a year. In Hongxi District, one dan of parboiled rice is equivalent to one dan and two dou of ordinary rice. Sichuan's "fire rice," Guangdong's "cooked rice," and Gansu's "kang rice" are also kinds of parboiled rice, and they can all produce about 30% more cooked rice than ordinary rice. Judging from the above materials, it is possible for parboiled rice to save 20% of grain in terms of cooked rice yield.

The fifteen counties and two cities in Jiaxing Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, are the most prosperous places for parboiled rice in the country. The area produces about 2.5 billion catties of rice annually. If all the paddy is steamed, the entire area will save hundreds of millions of catties of grain. As everyone knows, 133.2 million catties of rice can be exchanged for a complete set of machinery and equipment for an Anshan seamless steel pipe factory. Then the people of Jiaxing Prefecture can exchange a large amount of heavy industrial machinery and equipment for the country every year between one meal and one peck. If parboiled rice can be promoted nationwide, and if the heat treatment method can be promoted to other grains, how much grain will the country save throughout the year? Please calculate this account. The accumulation of funds for national socialist construction mainly relies on savings, and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party also called on us to increase production and practice economy. Although there are many specific objects of savings, the amount of grain saved from the promotion of parboiled rice is probably the largest number.

Parboiled rice is suitable for storage, so it is also of great significance to national defense.

How to Promote Parboiled Rice

Parboiled rice has such great value for people's health and the national economy, so it should indeed be promoted vigorously immediately. How to promote it? I only offer some suggestions.

A few years ago, several domestic medical colleagues had already verified that the nutritional value of parboiled rice made in the United States and India is not as high as that of our country's native method. American parboiled rice is not easy to digest; Indian parboiled rice has a poor odor and color. China's native parboiling method is very simple, and the equipment cost is 50 to 100 times lower than that of machine parboiling, and it can still achieve the purpose of mass production. I believe that, except for a few large cities, most areas of the country can adopt the direction of native parboiling before 1962. To this end, I suggest starting from the following two points:

First, this is an epoch-making food reform. This matter involves a wide range of aspects. It is not only closely related to six or seven ministries under the State Council, but also related to scientific institutions and medical and other social organizations. It is necessary to mobilize and concentrate the manpower of all parties to jointly plan and promote. I suggest that a committee be established under the direct leadership of the State Council to lead and formulate the plan for promoting parboiled rice. The committee should include those who have specialized research on parboiled rice to integrate the intelligence and opinions of all parties and jointly complete this major task.

Second, make full use of existing equipment and materials. Not only should the various existing parboiling equipment in cities and villages be restored and utilized as much as possible; handcrafted steamers, steaming buckets, and steaming baskets can also be used to steam grain in large quantities; most of the country's wineries have been shut down, and the old abandoned equipment can be used for steaming grain; Regardless of the region, every household in China has an iron pot for cooking rice, or a steaming bucket or steamer. If necessary, these furniture can also be used for steaming grain. As for using residual steam in factories to steam grain, the effect is even greater. In Nanxun Town, Zhejiang, this equipment was used three years ago.

Parboiled rice is not only nutritious and has a high cooked rice yield, so people naturally like to use this food. The implementation of native parboiling is convenient, the quality is high, and all regions have great production potential. I believe that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it and vigorously promotes it, parboiled rice will soon be promoted throughout the country, which will benefit the country and the people.

    蒸谷米是最营养最经济的食粮
　　人民政协全国委员会委员
　　北京医院中医专家顾问　施今墨
    蒸谷米（把稻谷先经过蒸制，晒干后再制成的白米）是世界上最合理的食粮。近年，苏联正在大力推广这种粮食；印度等以食米为主的国家，几乎都吃这种米。在我国某些省的部分地区素有蒸谷习惯。我是医务工作者，老家又在蒸谷较发达的浙江，因此有责任就推广蒸谷米来说几句话。
    蒸谷米与人民健康
    蒸谷米对于人民健康最显著的效用在防治脚气病。唐朝大医师孙思邈氏谷白皮粥治脚气之法，后来从谷皮治法再发展到蒸谷。因为稻谷在浸泡和汽蒸的过程中，使谷皮、谷胚、谷膜所含的一号乙种维生素、二号乙种维生素、尼克酸、无机盐等，溶在水中而透入米仁，它的营养素量因此大为增高。并且不易因碾磨或搓洗引起重大损失。中央粮食部于1954年在某地作了反复几十次的大量试制，证明小站谷未经蒸过，一号乙种维生素含量为0.080毫克，蒸过后为0.224毫克；晚籼未蒸为0.044毫克，蒸过0.208毫克。国外关于这种文献更多，据Swaminnthan氏的实验，蒸谷白米经淘洗后的一号乙种维生素含量，超越生谷白米经淘洗后所含量四倍到五倍；用这种米煮成饭的一号乙种维生素含量，也比生谷白米饭的这种维生素含量多三倍到四倍。经常食用这种米，能防止脚气病、心脏机能失调、多发性神经炎等疾病。
    我国南部脚气病患者很多，而且死亡率高。但食用蒸谷米的地区，很少有脚气病患者。据调查：1950年，浙江西部的衢县，脚气病患者有六百七十一人，而西部吃蒸谷米的长兴县患者只有六人，吴兴县则无一人患此病。这是一个很现实的对比。现在固然医学发达，卫生环境改善，脚气病治疗不大成为问题，但并没有消灭。如上海市的卫生医药设备，在全国较为完善，从1953年1月到5月，全市脚气病患者经过公私医院治疗者二千七百六十五人。我国人民平常不以此病为重，非到病象显著不肯就医，所以估计上海市未医治而患脚气病者大大超过此数。
    近年来，人民生活虽然普遍提高，但是还没有提高到理想的程度。据中央卫生研究部门对学校、工地以及边远地区人民的营养状况调查，二号乙种维生素缺乏症相当普遍。清华大学某教授说，现在学校中缺乏维生素病态者占50％以上。这几年，因患病离开工作或学习岗位而休养者占相当大的数字。我认为，国家与其关怀照顾于事后，不若更进一步的注意改良于事前。就是说改革主食品，大力推广蒸谷米，是增加营养的有效方法之一。这样既不花钱，又可以使人民走向健康大道，何乐而不为呢？
    蒸谷米与国民经济
    蒸谷米在经济上的价值十分巨大。蒸过的稻谷，一般要比没有蒸过的米多出饭二成到三成。浙江古代的一些文献上记录，农民终日勤劳，一天吃白米二升还不饱，吃了蒸谷米，一升许已经足够。有人在湖州粮食公司试验。每斤蒸谷米比每斤中白粳米可多出饭零点四八斤，每人每顿饭可省米二点七二两。长兴县四安区人民的生活经验证明：同用一斤米，白粳出饭二斤不到，蒸谷米出饭三斤到二斤十四两，一家五人吃饭，一年可省二石几斗米。在虹溪区一担蒸谷米可抵普通米一担二斗。四川的“火米”，广东的“熟米”，甘肃的“炕米”，也是蒸谷米的一种，它们都能比平常米多出饭三成左右。从以上种种材料来看，蒸谷米在出饭率上能节约粮食20％是可能的。
    浙江嘉兴专区的十五县二市为全国蒸谷最盛之地。该区年产稻约二十五亿斤多，如果稻谷统统蒸过，全区就将节余数亿斤粮食。大家知道，一亿三千三百二十万斤大米，就可换回一个鞍钢无缝钢管厂的全套机器设备。那么嘉兴专区人民在一饭一啄之间，每年可为国家换回大量的重工业机器设备。如果能在全国范围推广蒸谷米，如果把热处理法推广到其它粮食，那么，全年国家将会节省多少粮食？这笔账，请大家算一算。国家建设社会主义的资金积累，主要是依靠节约，党的八届二中全会也号召我们增产节约。节约的具体对象固然很多，但从推广蒸谷米所能省下的粮食，恐怕是一个最大的数字。
    蒸谷米适于保管，因此它在国防上也有很大的意义。
    怎样来推广蒸谷米
    蒸谷米对于人民健康和国民经济既有这样大的价值，确实应该立即大力推广。怎样来推广？我仅提供一些意见。
    在几年前，国内几位医务同人早已化验证明，美国及印度制的蒸谷米，营养价值都不及我国土法制的高。美国的蒸谷米不易消化；印度的蒸谷米的气味和色泽都较差。我国的土法蒸谷，十分简易，设备费用要比机器蒸谷节省五十倍至一百倍，而同样能达到大量生产的目的。我认为，除了几个大城市外，全国绝大多数地区都可以在1962年以前采用土法蒸谷的方向。为此，我建议从下述两点着手：
    第一，这是一件划时代性的民食改革，这件事情关涉的方面很广，不但与国务院所属的六、七个部有密切关系，并且与科学机构和医务等社会团体都有关联，必须动员和集中各方面的人力，共同来筹划策进。我建议在国务院直接领导之下，成立一个委员会，来领导和制定推广蒸谷米规划的工作。委员会应该容纳对蒸谷米有专门研究者参加，以融合各方面的智力和意见，共同完成这项重大工作。
    第二，要尽量利用原有的设备和器材。不仅城市、乡村原有的各种蒸谷设备要尽量的恢复和利用；手工业产品的蒸锅、蒸桶。蒸笼也可大量用来蒸谷；全国酒坊大部停顿，旧有废弃器材可利用蒸谷；我国不论地域，家家都有烧饭的铁锅，或有蒸桶、蒸笼，必要时，这些家具都可兼作蒸谷之用。至于工厂中利用余汽来蒸谷，效力更大，在浙江南浔镇，三年前，就利用这种设备。
    蒸谷米既富有营养，出饭率又高，人民自然喜欢采用这种食粮。实行土法蒸谷，既方便，质量又高，而且各地都具有很大的生产潜力。我相信，只要领导重视，大力提倡，蒸谷米就会很快地在全国各地推广开，这对国家、对人民都有好处。
