Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: Damascus News: Syria has requested an Arab League meeting to be convened immediately after British, French, and Israeli troops withdraw from Egypt. Syrian newspapers and the Damascus radio station clearly stated that the purpose of this meeting is to oppose the strengthening of the Baghdad Pact and to counter the meeting that Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey are scheduled to hold in Ankara.

Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: Beirut News: Syrian Minister of Public Works, Majiddin Jabri, said in the Lebanese capital on the 14th that Syria will not allow oil from foreign oil companies to flow through Syrian territory until all foreign troops have withdrawn from Egypt (including the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip).

Jabri told reporters that the Syrian government will definitely not pay to repair the pipelines that were cut off after the British and French launched an attack on Suez.
