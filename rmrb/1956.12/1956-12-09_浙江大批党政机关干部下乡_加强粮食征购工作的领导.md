Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 6th. Since the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee convened a meeting of prefectural committee secretaries in late November, it has taken measures to strengthen leadership in grain procurement work. Party and government organs at all levels throughout the province have sent cadres to the countryside to assist in grain procurement work. More than 80 cadres dispatched by the Provincial Grain Bureau have gone to Jiaxing, Ningbo, and other prefectures to assist local cadres in publicizing the method of unified purchase and sale of grain based on agricultural cooperatives, as well as the spirit of "public first, private second" to farmers. They are also helping disaster-stricken areas to reduce or exempt public grain.

The progress of grain procurement work in Zhejiang Province this year has been relatively slow, mainly because many rural cadres believe that it is easier to carry out grain procurement work based on agricultural cooperatives this year. They think that as long as they make an appeal, farmers will naturally deliver grain, so they have relaxed their leadership and have not thoroughly carried out the propaganda and education of the state's unified purchase and sale policy for grain to farmers. At the same time, the political and ideological work of agricultural cooperatives themselves has been worse than in previous years. Many agricultural cooperatives do not follow the principle of "public first, private second" in grain distribution, but instead distribute the grain to members first, and conceal production from higher authorities.

　  浙江大批党政机关干部下乡
　　加强粮食征购工作的领导
    新华社杭州6日电　中共浙江省各级组织在11月下旬召开地委书记会议以后，采取措施加强对粮食征购工作的领导。全省各级党、政机关纷纷派出干部下乡，协助粮食征购工作。省粮食厅派出的八十多名干部，已分别到嘉兴、宁波等专区，协助当地干部向农民宣传以农业社为单位的粮食统购统销办法和先公后私的精神，帮助受灾地区做好公粮减免等工作。
    浙江省今年粮食征购工作进展比较迟缓，主要是由于不少乡村干部认为今年以农业社为单位进行粮食征购工作，比较容易，只要号召一下，自然会送上门来，便放松了领导，也没有深入地向农民进行国家粮食统购统销政策的宣传教育。同时，农业社本身政治思想工作也比往年做得差，有许多农业社不按照粮食先公后私的分配原则，而是把粮食先分给社员，并且向上级隐瞒产量。
