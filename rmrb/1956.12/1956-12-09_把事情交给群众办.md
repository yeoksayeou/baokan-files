　　Entrust Matters to the Masses
　　Qian Yin
    In many cities and industrial and mining areas, some workers urgently need housing. The leadership has put in a lot of effort and built many houses, but it still cannot meet the needs of all workers who need housing. The Shenyang Cable Factory has adopted a very good method to solve this difficult problem, which is to entrust the matter to the masses.
    Originally, 1,011 employees of this factory requested housing. Due to the shortage of building materials, the employee dormitory completed this year can only accommodate more than 200 households. In this case, the problem seemed difficult to solve. However, when the factory leadership explained the housing shortage to the employees and laid out the difficulties in front of everyone, the workers who lacked housing expressed their willingness to continue to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and try to repair the dilapidated houses or use the method of nailing a new bunk to overcome this temporary difficulty. And 647 employees voluntarily withdrew their original housing applications. Some employees with relatively spacious houses also volunteered to vacate some houses. In this way, not only the tense housing situation was alleviated, but also a practical education of mutual assistance and fraternity was carried out among the employees.
    The leaders' offices or dormitories are relatively spacious, and taking the lead in vacating some houses is also one aspect of solving the housing problem. This also shows that our leading cadres can actively take the lead and promote the spirit of hard work, thrift, mutual assistance and fraternity. However, the houses that leaders can give up are ultimately limited. What's more, some leaders have large families and their houses are not very spacious. Relying solely on a few leading comrades to give up some offices and dormitories cannot solve the problem. At this time, it is especially necessary to mobilize the broad masses of employees to carry forward the spirit of hard work, thrift, mutual assistance and fraternity. This has become a very important method to solve the current housing problem.
    To mobilize the masses, we must first "disclose the bottom line," and hand over the current housing situation to the masses. At the same time as "disclosing the bottom line," we must also repeatedly explain to everyone: our lives are gradually improving, but there are still some difficulties at present, and these difficulties cannot be solved immediately. We must use the spirit of hard work to carry out socialist construction. If this is done, the broad masses of employees can fully understand the current difficulties and can overcome these difficulties with the attitude of masters. The example of the cable factory illustrates this point.
    It is worth pointing out that some enterprise leaders, when they receive applications from employees for housing, think that if there is no house, there is no house. What can be done? They only use "dragging," "pushing," and "vague" answers to deal with employees' applications, and some even take an attitude of ignoring them, which will cause dissatisfaction among the employees. This is certainly wrong.

　　把事情交给群众办
　　千音
    在不少的城市和工矿区里，部分职工迫切要求住宅，领导上花了很大的力气，也修建了不少房屋，但还不能满足所有需要房子职工的要求；对这个不大好解决的问题，沈阳电缆厂采取了一个很好的办法，就是把事情交给了群众。
    这个厂原先要求解决住宅问题的有一千零十一名职工，因为建筑材料不足，今年完成的职工宿舍仅能容纳二百多户，在这样的情况下，问题似乎不好解决，可是当这个厂领导上把住宅不足的情况向职工作了解释，把困难情况在大家面前摊开来以后，缺少住宅的职工，就纷纷表示要继续发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，设法把破漏的房子修一修或是用新钉一个吊铺的办法，来克服这种暂时的困难。并且有六百四十七名职工自动撤销了原来要房子的申请。还有一部分房子比较宽裕的职工，自愿腾出一部分房子。这样，不仅缓和了房屋紧张的状况，而且也在职工中进行了一次实际的互助友爱的教育。
    领导人员的办公室或宿舍比较宽裕，带头腾出部分房子，也是解决房子问题的一个方面。这样做也表现了我们领导干部能积极带头，发扬艰苦朴素、互助友爱的精神。但是，领导人员可以让出的房子终究是有限度的，何况有些领导人员家中人口多，房子也并非很宽裕。仅仅依靠少数领导同志让出部分办公室和宿舍，这还是不能解决问题。这时，特别需要发动广大职工群众，发扬艰苦朴素和互助友爱的精神。这就成为解决当前住房问题的一个很重要的方法了。
    要发动群众，首先就要“交底”，把当前住房情况的底子交给群众；在“交底”的同时，还要反反复复地向大家说清楚：我们的生活是在逐渐改善的，但是目前还有些困难，这些困难还不能马上都解决，还要用艰苦奋斗的精神来进行社会主义建设。如果这样做了，广大职工是完全可以理解当前的困难的，是能够用主人翁的态度来克服这些困难的。电缆厂的例子就说明了这一点。
    值得指出的是，目前我们有些企业的领导者，他们在接到职工要求住房的申请以后，思想上认为没有房子就是没有房子，这有什么办法呢？只用“拖”“推”“含糊其词”的答复，来对付职工的申请，有的甚至采取不问不理的态度，这样就会引起职工群众的不满。这当然是不对的。
