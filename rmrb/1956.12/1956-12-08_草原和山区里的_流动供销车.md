　　Grasslands and Mountainous Areas里的
　　Mobile Supply and Marketing Vehicles
    Xinhua News Agency, Hailar Telegram: In the vast Hulunbuir grasslands and the Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia, there are now large numbers of mobile supply and marketing vehicles supplying farmers and herdsmen with various daily necessities. This is a new undertaking carried out this year by the Hulunbuir League Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, based on the characteristics of the vast local area, the high mobility of herdsmen, and the dispersed population in mountainous areas.
    In addition to preparing various general merchandise and food items needed by farmers and herdsmen, these mobile supply and marketing vehicles also purchase local and special products, scrap copper and iron, or cattle bones, etc., and bring them back to the supply and marketing cooperatives. Some mobile supply and marketing vehicles are also equipped with barbers and tailors to provide haircuts and process bedding for farmers and herdsmen. Therefore, mobile supply and marketing vehicles are very popular among the people in these areas. In pastoral areas, the supply and marketing vehicles move wherever the herdsmen graze, and the herdsmen can buy what they need at any time.

　  草原和山区里的
　　流动供销车
    据新华社海拉尔电　在内蒙古辽阔的呼伦贝尔草原和大兴安岭山区，现在经常有大批的流动供销车供应农民和牧民各种生活用品。这是内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟供销合作社根据本地地区辽阔，牧民流动性大，山区人口分散的特点，今年开展的一项新的工作。
    这种流动供销车除准备了各种百货、食品等供给农民、牧民们需要外，还收购土特产品、废铜烂铁或牛骨头等带回供销社。有些流动供销车还配备理发员和裁缝替农民、牧民理发和加工被服。因此，流动供销车很受这些地区人民的欢迎。在牧区里，牧民游牧到哪里，供销车也流动到哪里，牧民随时可以买到所需的东西。
