Xinhua News Agency, December 13th dispatch from New York: Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation to the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly, wrote to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on December 12th, suggesting that the important and pressing issue of "US interference in the internal affairs of the people's democratic countries and its sabotage activities against these countries" be included in the agenda of the 11th session of the United Nations General Assembly, and requested the Assembly to discuss the issue immediately.

A note was attached to the letter. The note stated that although the issue of US sabotage activities against other countries and interference in their internal affairs was discussed at the sixth and seventh sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, these activities have not only not stopped, but have intensified. The hostile activities of the United States against Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia are aimed at undermining the political systems freely chosen by the people of these countries. The recent events in Hungary and the intensified espionage and sabotage activities against other people's democratic countries particularly clearly illustrate this point.

The note stated that the methods used by the United States to carry out sabotage activities and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries are varied, such as: specially training spies and sending them in large numbers to infiltrate socialist countries to organize and carry out large-scale espionage and sabotage activities; the US Congress annually appropriates special funds to subsidize destructive organizations and groups operating inside and outside socialist countries in order to oppose the existing systems of these countries; US radio stations in Western Europe, including Radio Free Europe, carry out provocative activities; the United States releases balloons carrying printed matter into the airspace of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, the contents of which are intended to incite rebellion, sabotage, and disruption in these countries; US national leaders issue various declarations and letters to the people of socialist countries, calling on them to overthrow the political and economic systems of these countries, and so on.

These hostile activities of the United States against socialist countries seriously violate the United Nations Charter and are inconsistent with the principles that member states of the United Nations should abide by in their relations with other countries. These activities are increasing international tension and deteriorating relations between countries.

Under these circumstances, the United Nations has a responsibility to take urgent measures to stop such sabotage activities and interference in the internal affairs of other countries by the United States.

The note stated that the Soviet delegation believes that it is necessary for the United Nations General Assembly to immediately discuss the issue of "US interference in the internal affairs of the people's democratic countries and its sabotage activities against these countries" at its eleventh session.

Xinhua News Agency, December 13th dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly on December 12th passed a proposal by the United States and twenty other countries slandering the Soviet Union. In addition to insisting on sending United Nations "observers" to Hungary, the proposal also "condemned" the so-called Soviet "violation of the United Nations Charter," demanded that the Soviet Union withdraw its troops from Hungary under United Nations observation, and requested the United Nations Secretary-General to take steps that would supposedly be "helpful to the Hungarian problem" in accordance with the Assembly's resolution.

The voting was 55 in favor, 8 against, and 13 abstentions. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries voted against. Afghanistan, Cambodia, Egypt, Finland, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Yugoslavia abstained.

Before the vote, representatives of many countries spoke on the Hungarian events.

Soviet Representative Sobolev pointed out that the United States is currently leading the United Nations in a "dangerous political gamble" on the Hungarian situation, and it is poisoning the international situation and spreading the seeds of poison and hatred.

Sobolev pointed out that the purpose of the twenty-nation proposal is nothing more than an attempt to artificially aggravate the situation. The Hungarian delegation has already left the Assembly due to the harsh and insulting attacks.

Sobolev condemned the United States for inciting the anti-government rebellion in Hungary, and compared the US conspiracy to the rebellion in Guatemala in 1954. In the Guatemalan incident, US monopoly groups had instigated rebels to overthrow the democratic government of Arbenz.

Sobolev finally accused the United States of carrying out subversive activities in the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe and demanded that such activities be stopped.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Palamarchuk and Polish Representative Naszkowski spoke at the General Assembly against the twenty-nation proposal. Palamarchuk said that it was absolutely necessary for the Soviet Union to help the People's Republic of Hungary deal with the reactionary forces. Without such help, the roots of war would probably have been planted in Central Europe. Palamarchuk accused Radio Free Europe of playing an insidious role in the Hungarian events.

    苏联代表向联大主席提出建议
    要求讨论美国干涉人民民主国家内政问题
    美国操纵联大通过诽谤苏联的二十国提案
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约12日讯：苏联出席联合国大会第十一届会议代表团团长库兹?佐夫12月12日写信给联合国大会主席，建议把“美国对人民民主国家内政的干涉和它对这些国家的破坏活动”这一重要而迫切的问题列入联合国大会第十一届会议的议程，并且要求大会立即讨论这个问题。
    随信附了一份说明书。这份说明书说：美国对其他国家的破坏活动和干涉他国内政的问题虽然早在联合国大会第六届会议和第七届会议上讨论过，但是这种活动不但没有停止，反而变本加厉。美国对阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克这些国家进行敌对活动，是为了破坏这些国家的人民自由选择的政治制度。最近的匈牙利事件以及对其他人民民主国家进行的间谍破坏活动的加剧，特别清楚地说明这一点。
    说明书说，美国进行破坏活动和干涉他国内政的方式是多种多样的，例如：专门培养奸细，大批派遣他们潜入社会主义国家内组织和进行大规模的间谍破坏活动；美国国会每年拨出专款资助在社会主义国家境内、境外活动的破坏组织和集团，以便反对这些国家现存的制度；美国在西欧的电台，包括“自由欧洲”电台在内，进行挑衅活动；美国向苏联领空和人民民主国家领空放出带有印刷品的气球，这些印刷品的内容是想在这些国家内煽起叛变、怠工和破坏活动；美国国家负责人向社会主义国家人民发出各种宣言和信件，号召他们推翻这些国家的政治制度和经济制度等等。
    美国这些对社会主义国家的敌对活动严重地违反联合国宪章，并且不符合联合国会员国同其他国家相处所应依据的原则。这种活动使得国际局势日益紧张，国和国之间的关系趋于恶化。
    在这种条件下，联合国有责任采取紧急措施，来制止美国这种破坏活动和对他国内政的干涉。
    说明书说，苏联代表团认为，联合国大会有必要在十一届会议上即行讨论关于“美国对人民民主国家内政的干涉和它对这些国家的破坏活动”的问题。
    据新华社13日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会12月12日的会议通过了美国等二十个国家提出的诽谤苏联的提案。提案除了坚持要派联合国
  “观察员”到匈牙利去以外，还“谴责”所谓苏联“违反联合国宪章”，要求苏联在联合国的观察下从匈牙利撤出军队，并且要求联合国秘书长根据大会决议采取所谓对“匈牙利问题有所帮助”的步骤。
    表决的情况是：五十五票赞成，八票反对，十三票弃权。投反对票的是苏联和人民民主国家。弃权的是阿富汗、柬埔寨、埃及、芬兰、印度、印度尼西亚、约旦、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、叙利亚、也门和南斯拉夫。
    在表决前，许多国家的代表就匈牙利事件作了发言。
    苏联代表索波列夫指出，美国目前正在就匈牙利局势引导联合国进行“危险的政治赌博”，它正在毒化国际局势，散布毒素和仇恨的种子。
    索波列夫指出，二十国提案的目的不是别的，而只是一个打算人为地使局势恶化的企图。由于受到粗暴的和侮辱性的攻击，匈牙利代表团已经离开了大会。
    索波列夫谴责美国煽动匈牙利的反政府叛乱，并且把美国的阴谋同1954年危地马拉的叛乱事件作比较。在危地马拉事件中，美国的垄断集团曾经策动叛乱分子推翻阿本斯民主政府。
    索波列夫最后指责美国在东欧人民民主国家进行的颠覆活动，并且要求制止这种活动。
    乌克兰外交部长帕拉马尔楚克和波兰代表纳希科夫斯基在大会发言反对二十国提案。帕拉马尔楚克说，苏联帮助匈牙利人民共和国来对付反动势力是绝对必要的。如果没有这种帮助，恐怕已经在中欧埋下了战争的根源。帕拉马尔楚克指责“自由欧洲电台”在匈牙利事件中起了阴险的作用。
