Xinhua News Agency, December 26th -- According to TASS: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on December 26th entitled "The Resolutions of the December Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee are the Fighting Program of Our Work," saying that the CPSU Central Committee plenary session discussed urgent issues concerning the further development of the socialist economy and the improvement of leadership in economic construction, which will occupy an important position in the life of the Party and the people and will play an important role in the struggle to realize the historically significant resolutions of our Party's Twentieth Congress. The plenary session summarized the development of the national economy in the period since the Twentieth Party Congress and indicated that the resolutions of the Congress are being victoriously implemented.

The editorial, after quoting the growth of Soviet industry and agriculture this year as listed in the plenary session's resolutions, pointed out that these achievements once again powerfully demonstrate the correctness of our Party's policy and demonstrate that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system. This superiority powerfully guarantees that socialism will inevitably win in the peaceful economic competition between the two systems of socialism and capitalism.

The significance of the CPSU Central Committee plenary session lies in better and more fully utilizing the enormous superiority of world-historical significance inherent in the socialist structure and the socialist system, so as to further strengthen our country's economic power and further consolidate our country's national defense strength, and further improve the welfare of the Soviet people. Now, we already possess all the necessary conditions to transition to a new and higher stage of economic development commensurate with the current stage of communist construction.

The editorial said that while pointing out the achievements in the development of the socialist economy, the CPSU Central Committee plenary session also pointed out serious shortcomings in the leadership of the national economy. And it formulated specific measures to greatly develop the national economy, pointing out the ways to eliminate these shortcomings. These measures fully conform to Lenin's principles of socialist management based on democratic centralism. The editorial said that clichés and unified regulations from above have nothing in common with socialist democratic centralism. Unity on major, fundamental, and important matters must not be undermined, but diversification in details, local characteristics, and approaches to problems should be guaranteed.

The editorial continued, saying that the socialist economic system, the truly people-oriented Soviet system, in fact, opens up broad room for the broad masses of working people to practically participate in the management of production, that is, to manage production through various producer conferences. The nationwide socialist competition with the participation of millions of laborers is of particular significance in this regard. However, the tasks of current production and construction have increased and become more complex, and the cultural and technical level of the working class has greatly improved, which urgently requires more extensive attraction of the working people to manage production. Therefore, the plenary session's resolutions emphasize that the work of the Soviet trade unions must be brought to a higher level.

The editorial concluded by saying that the resolutions adopted by the CPSU Central Committee plenary session reflect the vital interests of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union and the interests of communist construction. The resolutions demonstrate the further enhancement of our Party's leading role in the Soviet state system and demonstrate the complete Leninist unity of the Party ranks – the unity of the Party's goals and actions. The struggle to realize the plenary session's resolutions is the fighting program of action for all the people of the Soviet Union.

    苏联“真理报”发表社论
    号召为实现苏共中央决议而斗争
    新华社26日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联“真理报”12月26日发表题为“苏共中央十二月全会的决议是我们工作的战斗纲领”的社论说，苏共中央全会讨论了有关进一步发展社会主义经济和改善经济建设的领导方面的迫切问题，这将在党和人民的生活中占有重大的地位，将在为实现我们党第二十次代表大会具有历史意义的决议的斗争中起重要的作用。全会总结了二十次党代表大会以来一段时期内的国民经济发展情况，说明了代表大会的决议正在胜利地实现。
    社论在引述了全会决议所列举的今年苏联工农业的增长情况以后指出，这些成就又一次有力地表明了我们党的政策的正确性，表明了社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越得多。这种优越性有力地保证了在社会主义和资本主义两种制度的和平经济竞赛当中，社会主义必将获得胜利。
    苏共全会决议的意义在于，更好地和更充分地运用社会主义结构和社会主义制度中具有世界历史意义的极大优越性，以便进一步加强我国的经济威力和进一步巩固我国的国防力量，进一步提高苏联人民的福利。现在，我们已经具备一切必要条件，以过渡到同共产主义建设现阶段相适应的新的更高的经济发展阶段。
    社论说，苏共中央全会在指出发展社会主义经济的成就的同时，也指出了国民经济领导工作中的严重缺点。并且拟定了大大发展国民经济的具体措施，指出了消除这些缺点的道路。这些措施充分符合以民主集中制为基础的列宁的社会主义经营原则。社论说，陈规旧套以及上级的统一规定同社会主义民主集中制没有丝毫共同的地方。在主要的、根本性的、重大事情上的团结不容破坏，但是，在细节、地方特点、对待问题的方法方面的多样化应当得到保证。
    社论接着说，社会主义的经济制度，真正具有人民性的苏维埃制度，事实上为广大的劳动群众实际参加管理生产开辟了广阔的余地，也就是通过各种生产者会议来进行管理生产。有千百万劳动者参加的全民社会主义竞赛在这方面具有特别重大的意义。但是，现今生产建设的任务已经增加和复杂了，工人阶级的文化技术水平大大提高了，这就迫切需要更加广泛地吸引劳动人民来管理生产。因此，全会决议着重指出，必须使苏联工会工作达到更高的水平。
    社论最后说，苏共中央全会通过的决议反映了苏联各族人民的切身利益和共产主义建设的利益。决议证明了我们党在苏维埃国家制度中的领导作用的进一步提高，证明了党的队伍的列宁主义的完全一致——党的目标和行动的一致。为实现全会决议而斗争是苏联全体人民的战斗的行动纲领。
