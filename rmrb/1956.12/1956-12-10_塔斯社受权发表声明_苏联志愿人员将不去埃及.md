　　TASS Authorized to Issue Statement
　　Soviet Volunteers Will Not Go to Egypt
　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 8th (TASS): TASS issued a statement on November 10th announcing that if the aggressors, in violation of the United Nations resolution, did not withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory, the relevant Soviet government agencies would not prevent Soviet volunteer citizens from departing for Egypt.
    Now, the governments of Britain, France, and Israel have officially declared to the Secretary-General of the United Nations that they will immediately withdraw all their armed forces from Egypt and have issued corresponding instructions to their command headquarters, although they simultaneously, directly or indirectly, put forward certain conditions for the thorough implementation of the United Nations resolution.
    According to information obtained, British and French troops have begun to withdraw from Port Said, and Israeli troops have also begun to withdraw from Egyptian territory.
    Thus, under the pressure of world public opinion and all peace-loving forces, Britain, France, and Israel have had to comply with the United Nations General Assembly's resolution requiring them to withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory.
    The statement said that the Soviet people note with great satisfaction that the flames of war in the Arab East have been extinguished, and they expect the governments of Britain, France, and Israel to fulfill their obligations, thereby establishing lasting peace and tranquility in this region of the world.
    In view of the above circumstances, TASS is authorized to state that the complete withdrawal of British, French, and Israeli troops from Egypt naturally cancels the question of the departure of Soviet volunteers to Egypt. The establishment of lasting peace and practical cooperation between countries has been and will continue to be the cornerstone of Soviet foreign policy.

    塔斯社受权发表声明
　　苏联志愿人员将不去埃及
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科8日讯：塔斯社11月10日曾发表声明宣布，如果侵略者违背联合国决议不把军队撤出埃及领土，那么苏联政府的有关机关将不阻止苏联的志愿公民出发去埃及。
    现在，英国、法国和以色列三国政府已经向联合国秘书长正式声明说，它们立即把自己所有的武装部队撤出埃及，已给它们的司令部下了相应的指令，虽然它们同时直接间接地为彻底执行联合国的决议提出某些条件。
    根据所获得的消息，英国和法国的军队开始撤出塞得港，以色列的军队也开始撤出埃及领土。
    这样，在世界公众和一切和平力量的压力下，英国、法国和以色列不得不服从联合国大会的关于要它们把军队撤出埃及领土的决议。
    声明说，苏联人民非常满意地指出，在阿拉伯东方战火已经熄灭了，他们期望英国、法国和以色列三国政府履行它们所承担的义务，从而使世界上这个地区建立起牢固的和平和安宁。
    鉴于以上情况，塔斯社受权声明，英国、法国和以色列军队的完全撤出埃及当然取消了关于苏联的志愿人员出发去埃及的问题。各国之间建立持久和平和切实的合作过去是、今后也将是苏联外交政策的基石。
