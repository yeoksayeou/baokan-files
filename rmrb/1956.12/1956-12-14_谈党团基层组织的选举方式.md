    On the Election Methods of Basic-Level Party and League Organizations
    Zhang Xuezhi
    Editor's Note: The election methods of basic-level Party and League organizations must be carried out in accordance with the principles of the Party's democratic centralism. Candidates can be nominated by the branch committee or by Party and League members themselves; the number of candidates can be equal to the number of those to be elected, or it can exceed the number of those to be elected. But no matter which method is adopted, it should be discussed and decided by the branch general meeting. If it is believed that only the branch committee needs to nominate candidates, and Party and League members do not need to nominate candidates, and that the number of candidates nominated can only be equal to the number of those to be elected and cannot exceed the number of those to be elected, then this is not entirely in line with the spirit of the Party's democratic centralism. Therefore, some of the arguments criticized in the following article deserve the attention of all basic-level Party and League organizations.

    In some basic-level Party and League organizations, there is a popular election method: the branch committee nominates candidates, nominating as many as will be elected.

    This election method, if used in non-basic-level organizations, or even in basic-level organizations, but only when the organization is newly established and everyone does not know each other very well, is understandable and necessary. But if it is used in general basic-level organizations where everyone works and studies together day and night and the number of people is not large, it is puzzling.

    The lack of democratic spirit in this election method is obvious. Although these basic-level organizations often explain when using this method that voters can cross out the people they do not want to vote for on the ballot and write in the people they want to vote for. But imagine that among the candidates nominated by the branch committee, if I do not want to vote for Candidate C and want to vote for Candidate D who is not on the list of candidates nominated by the branch committee, although I have crossed out Candidate C's name and replaced it with Candidate D's name, Candidate D is unlikely to be elected because he is not a publicly recognized candidate. In this way, even if many people are dissatisfied with certain candidates and vote for the people they are more satisfied with, the people who are elected tend to remain within the list of candidates due to the dispersion of votes.

    Affirmatively speaking, the consequences of using this election method are negative. This is manifested in two aspects: first, everyone is not interested in this kind of election because the election results do not fully reflect the will of the voters; second, the election loses its role of supervising and educating the candidates, because the candidates do not necessarily have to base their chances of being elected on the quality of their work and conduct, but mainly rely on whether the branch committee nominates them as candidates. This seriously affects the development of democratic life in some basic-level Party and League organizations.

    However, some people defend this election method.

    Some people say that this election method is a highly centralized application.

    We say that a high degree of centralization must be built on a high degree of democracy. If candidates are not generated from the masses, where does the high degree of centralization come from? Moreover, unilaterally emphasizing a high degree of centralization inevitably restricts the exercise of democratic rights.

    Some people also say that the candidates nominated by the branch committee are proposed after research, and the candidates proposed in this way are roughly the same as those proposed by the masses themselves; moreover, proposing them from above can avoid the trouble of the masses proposing them.

    We say that "roughly the same" is entirely possible, but the problem is that some people, or a certain person, among the candidates nominated by the branch committee may not be welcomed by the masses. As for not letting the masses nominate their own candidates for fear of trouble, that is even more wrong, because democracy, in a sense, is sometimes about "trouble." Deciding issues bureaucratically is of course the simplest and least "troublesome," but can we advocate arbitrariness? Only by implementing democracy in a "troublesome" way can we gain the sincere support of the masses, can we achieve a genuine unity between the led and the leaders, and can we do our work well.

    Still others say that the difference between the branch committee nominating candidates and the Party and League members themselves nominating candidates is only a matter of method, and there is no difference in essence. Therefore, the conclusion is: the branch committee can still nominate candidates.

    We say that this is indeed a matter of method in the election, but we must ask a question in return: Is the method not important? We must analyze the issue of methods, and we cannot immediately show a look of indifference as soon as we hear that it is an issue of methods. You must know that, for example, when going shopping, whether to go by bicycle or on foot is irrelevant, and it does not matter which way you do it; but for issues such as elections, you cannot look at it that way. How the election method is truly concerns the big question of whether the election is democratic or not. How can we equate them?

    Finally, it is also possible that some people will, without allowing any explanation, put a label on those who do not agree with this election method: "You are extremely democratic" or the like.

    To this, we do not want to argue with him, please let him study the Party and League constitutions carefully and study what is called democracy and what is called extreme democracy.

    We hope that the basic-level organizations that adopt the election method that actually deprives the Party and League members of their democratic right to nominate candidates (except in special circumstances) will change the election method and return the right to nominate candidates to the Party and League members themselves. This will further stimulate everyone's enthusiasm in organizational life and increase their interest in their political life.

### 谈党团基层组织的选举方式

    谈党团基层组织的选举方式
    张学致
    编者按：党团基层组织的选举方式必须根据党的民主集中制的原则来进行。候选人可以由支委会来提，也可以由党团员自己来提；候选人可以等于当选人的名额，也可以超过当选人的名额。但不管采取那种方式，都应该由支部大会讨论决定。如果认为只需要支委会提候选人，不需要党团员提候选人，提出的候选人只能等于当选人的名额，不能多于当选人的名额，就是与党的民主集中制的精神不完全符合，因而下面这篇文章所批判的一些论点值得所有基层党团组织注意。
    在我们党团的一些基层组织中流行着这样一种选举方式：支委会提后选人，选几名提几名。
    这种选举方式如果是运用在非基层组织，或虽为基层组织，但是是在组织刚建立，大家相互间还不大了解的情况下，是可以理解的，也是必要的。但是如果是运用在大家朝夕在一起工作、学习、人数不多的一般基层组织中，就使人纳闷了。
    这种选举方式的缺乏民主精神是很显然的。虽然这些基层组织在运用这种方式时，往往也说明，选举人可以在选票上划去你不愿选的人，写上你愿选的人。但是试设想在支委会所提的后选人中，我若不愿选丙，而想选不在支委会所提候选人之列的丁，我虽划去了丙的名字代以丁的名字，而丁因为不是公认的候选人，就很少有可能被选上。这样，即使有很多人对某些候选人不满，选了自己比较满意的人，但由于票数分散，选出来的人往往还是越不出候选名单上的名字。
    肯定地说，运用这种选举方式所产生的后果是消极的。这表现两方面：首先是大家对这种选举不感兴趣，因为选举的结果并不能充分反映选举者的意志；其次使选举失去对候选人监督、教育的作用，因为候选人可以不以他的工作和作风的好坏，作为他能否当选的条件，而主要依靠支委会提不提他作为候选人。这就严重地影响了我们党团某些基层组织中民主生活的开展。
    然而竟有人为这种选举方式辩护。
    有人说，这种选举方式是一种高度集中的运用。
    我们说，高度的集中必须建立在高度的民主基础上。候选人不是从群众中产生出来的，那来的高度集中？而且片面地强调高度集中，必然限制了民主权利的发挥。
    有人又说，支委会所提的后选人是经过研究后提出的，这样提出的候选人与群众自己所提的大致差不多；而且由上边提出，可免去由群众提的麻烦。
    我们说，“大致差不多”是完全可能的，但问题就在支委会所提的后选人中有某些人，或某个人不一定为群众所欢迎。至于为怕麻烦，就不让群众自己提候选人，那更是不应该的，因为民主在某种意义上说，有时就是要“麻烦”的。官僚式地决定问题当然是最简便最不“麻烦”的，但是能够提倡独断专行吗？只有“麻烦”地实行了民主，才能得到群众的真心拥护，才能做到被领导与领导的真正一致，才能把工作做好。
    又有人说，由支委会提候选人与由党团员群众自己提，只不过是一种方式方法的问题，本质上没有区别，因此结论是：仍可由支委会提。
    我们说，这的确是选举上的一种方式方法问题，但我们要反问一句：难道方式方法就不重要吗？我们必须有分析地来看待方式方法问题，不能一听说是方式方法问题，马上就露出一种颠之倒之均可的神气。要知道，譬如上街买东西，是用骑车子去的方式，还是用步行的方式，那是无关紧要的，颠之倒之均可；但是对选举这样的问题，就不能那样看了。选举的方式方法如何，是真正地关涉到选举的民主与否的大问题，何能等同而视之。
    最后，也可能有人会不容分说地，给不赞成这种选举方式的人戴上一个帽子：“你极端民主”之类。
    对这，我们不想跟他辩论，请他好好学学党章团章，研究一下什么叫民主，什么叫极端民主。
    我们希望采用那种实际上剥夺了党团员群众提候选人的民主权利的选举方式的基层组织（除非在特殊情况下），都改变一下选举方式，把提候选人的权利交还给党团员群众自己。这样会在组织生活中进一步激发大家的积极性，会增加他们对自己的政治生活的兴趣。
