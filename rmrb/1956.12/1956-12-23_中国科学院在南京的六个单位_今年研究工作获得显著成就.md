Xinhua News Agency report by Xinhua News Agency reporter Shi Mei: The six units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing have made significant achievements in scientific research this year.

Research in soil science has focused primarily on five central issues: soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, soil research in tropical and subtropical red soil areas, soil research in the irrigated areas of the lower Yellow River, research on basic national soil resource issues, and research on paddy soils. The Institute of Soil Science, in conjunction with controlling the Yellow River and developing Yellow River water conservancy, conducted research on the distribution and formation laws of soils in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the types and laws of soil erosion in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, and the soils in the irrigated areas of the lower Yellow River. Researchers conducted surveys and studies in the Tianshui-Lanzhou area, completed 1:200,000 soil and erosion maps, and conducted surveys and studies in key areas. The institute's research on irrigated area soils completed general soil surveys between Beijing, Tianjin, Cangxian, Baoding, and between western Shandong and southern Hebei this year, and conducted research on the causes of soil salinization, prevention measures, and economical water use. Surveys, studies, and experiments on red soil areas and agrochemical research on phosphorus in acidic soils have provided data for the rational utilization of land resources and the improvement of agricultural production. The Institute of Soil Science also compiled "Soils of China," totaling 400,000 words, this year. It revised and published the 1:4,000,000 Soil Map of China and its explanation.

Researchers at the Institute of Paleontology completed thirty papers on paleontology and stratigraphy this year, including "Flora of the Mesozoic Oil-Bearing Strata in the Junggar Basin" and "Flora of the Upper Devonian in Xinjiang." They conducted field research on "Research on Lower Paleozoic Strata and Fossil Collection in Western Hubei" and "Research on Middle and Upper Paleozoic Strata and Fossil Collection in Guangxi." This year, 194 geological exploration teams and geological institutions from all over the country sent fossils to the Institute of Paleontology for identification. They promptly solved many stratigraphic problems for geologists across the country, helping geological teams explore for useful minerals.

The research work of the Institute of Geography this year has devoted most of its manpower to comprehensive surveys and research, such as the study of China's natural regionalization, which is included in the National Science and Technology Development Plan; the Xinjiang comprehensive survey; the soil and water conservation survey in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, which is closely related to the basin planning for controlling the Yellow River; the compilation and cleaning of fifty-eight 1:200,000 topographic maps of the Yellow River and Hai River basins; participation in the joint Sino-Soviet survey on the comprehensive development and utilization of the Heilongjiang River; and related surveys on agricultural regionalization in the Inner Mongolia region. The compilation of the "Chinese Economic Geography" and the geography of Southeast Asian countries continued. In terms of maps, the study of map generalization methods was carried out through the compilation of the 1:4,000,000 topographical map of China and the typical map of the East and West Mountains of Taihu Lake. In terms of geodesy, twenty-three gravity points were mainly completed in central Shaanxi, and the gravity measurement work of the past three years was summarized. Two basic astronomical points were completed in Urumqi and Chengdu. The institute assisted Suzhou in triangulation, and also conducted indoor research on refraction coefficients and the Qingel astronomical measurement method.

This year, the Zijinshan Observatory mainly conducted research on the internal structure of the sun, the structure of the solar photosphere, the inspection of solar grating spectrometers, sunspots, celestial photometry, trial shooting and research of stellar spectra, and the viscosity coefficient of white dwarf stars. It also ground a 20 cm and two 30 cm reflecting mirrors, as well as a batch of spherical mirrors and corrective lenses. This year, the Zijinshan Observatory also completed the 1957 Astronomical Almanac, the 1957 Nautical Astronomical Almanac, and the 1957 Aviation Astronomical Almanac two and three months ahead of schedule, respectively, and compiled the 200-year calendar table from 1821 to 2020.

The Nanjing Historical Materials Sorting Office of the Third Institute of the Institute of History has sorted out 95% of all the historical archives collected from all over the country this year and compiled a catalog. Many valuable revolutionary historical materials have also been discovered in the archives. These historical materials are important documents for the study of modern and contemporary history.

This year, the Nanjing Zhongshan Botanical Garden of the Institute of Botany compiled the fifth volume of "Flora of Chinese Medicinal Plants" and "Nanjing Folk Herbs," and conducted observational studies on the biological characteristics of peaches and jujube trees. The "Illustrated Handbook of Gramineae" compiled by the famous gramineae research expert Geng Yili and his son Geng Mengjie analyzed and studied hundreds of gramineae plants and bamboos. This year, the Zhongshan Botanical Garden also introduced more than 2,000 seedlings from home and abroad and established seed exchange contacts with sixty-three botanical gardens in twenty-four European and Asian countries.

    中国科学院在南京的六个单位
    今年研究工作获得显著成就
    新华社讯　新华社记者石煤报道：中国科学院在南京的六个单位今年的科学研究工作有显著成就。
    土壤方面的研究主要是围绕黄河中游水土保持工作、热带和亚热带红壤区的土壤研究。黄河下游灌溉区土壤研究、土壤资源全国性基本问题的研究和水稻土的研究等五个中心问题进行。土壤研究所结合根治黄河和开发黄河水利，对黄河中游土壤分布及生成规律、黄河中游土壤侵蚀类型及规律和黄河下游灌区土壤进行了研究。研究人员作了天水兰州间地区的调查研究，完成了二十万分之一的土壤图和侵蚀图以及重点地区的调查研究。这个研究所进行的灌区土壤研究，今年完成了北京、天津、沧县、保定间和鲁西、冀南间的土壤概测，并进行了土壤盐渍化的成因、防止措施和经济用水的研究。在红壤区土壤的调查研究试验和酸性土壤磷的农业化学研究上，为合理利用土地资源和提高农业生产提供了资料。土壤研究所今年还编辑了长达四十万字的“中国之土壤”。修正和出版了四百万分之一的中国土壤图及其说明。
    古生物研究所研究人员今年完成了古生物和地层方面论文“准噶尔盆地中生代含油地层的植物群”、“新疆上泥盆纪植物群”等三十篇。他们在野外进行了“鄂西下古生代地层研究及化石采集”、“广西中、上古生代地层研究及化石采集”的调查研究工作。今年内全国各地有一百九十四个地质勘探队和地质机构等单位送化石到古生物研究所鉴定，他们及时地为各地地质工作者解决了许多地层问题，帮助了各地质队探勘有用的矿物。
