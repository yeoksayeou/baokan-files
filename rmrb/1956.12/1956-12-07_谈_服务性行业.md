　　On "Service Industries"
　　Tian Yi
　　If we have a "mindset" in our daily work that leans more towards the people, we cannot help but recognize the importance of service industries.

　　For example, if we plan to build several large buildings for office use far from the bustling city center, there will be hundreds or thousands of people working in these buildings, and even more family members living in that area. These thousands of people need to eat, and eat all kinds of things; they need to use a wide variety of daily necessities; they also have demands for cultural life with different preferences, as well as other needs in life, such as haircuts and baths. Insufficient attention to "service industries" often makes people who go to work in places far from the city feel many inconveniences in their lives.

　　Some comrades who lead the service industries are not interested in our past traditions. There is a restaurant in the western suburbs of Beijing that stipulates that customers must first order food, pay, and get a number plate. After these three procedures are completed, they find an empty seat themselves and wait; and not just wait, but also pay constant attention to the place where the numbers are called; when your number is called, you take the number plate and get the food yourself. This method is somewhat similar to the one used in the canteens of government offices, but it is more complicated. We cannot see the "service" atmosphere in this place at all.

　　Shanghai is the most concentrated place for service industries, with rich and diverse experience in this industry. For a long time, we did not pay attention to these experiences. It was only last year when a barber who was popular with customers was elected as a representative to the Shanghai Municipal Political Consultative Conference that people had a strong feeling of "every profession produces its own leading figures," and the service industry received attention from public opinion. However, in the barber industry, no one has "taken on apprentices" for seven years, and the former apprentices are now masters themselves. There are no successors behind the new masters.

　　Living in Beijing for a long time, I often get very angry because the "low service level" of some food and beverage industries artificially causes customers to wait for a long time, resulting in overcrowding. During a few days' stay in Shanghai in October this year, I immediately felt that the service level of Shanghai's food and beverage industry was much higher than that of Beijing. However, there is an unfair phenomenon in Shanghai's food and beverage industry: that is, "old joint ventures" (several companies that were approved as joint state-private enterprises before the industry-wide joint state-private ownership) and "new joint ventures" adopt two different wage systems: the former is a wage system, and the latter is a profit-sharing system, and the latter gets much more remuneration than the former. The "old joint ventures" took the lead, but suffered a lot. In my opinion, the "old joint ventures" are some of the more famous restaurants in Shanghai, and the service level of the employees is generally very high. Daily necessities still implement "high quality, high price," why can't workers get fairer treatment?

　　We are even more uneasy about the fact that some of Shanghai's "characteristics" have not only not been promoted, but are also disappearing. People who have lived in Shanghai know that if you want to eat some snacks, you can solve the problem as soon as you run out of the lane (hutong), but now because of "cooperation," many are merged, and it is not as satisfactory as before. Shanghai has a wide variety of mobile stalls, carrying hot snacks in front of the citizens' houses. Many foreign friends who have visited Shanghai are very interested in this kind of meticulous service attitude; in fact, this kind of stall is now so reduced that it is almost difficult to find. Many people in Shanghai are shouting: the light bulb is broken, and it is impossible to find an electrician to repair it; the leather shoes are broken, and I don't know where the shoe repair stall has gone; I want to find a cooperative to repair the refrigerator in the hot summer, but they say they will send someone to repair it after October (which is winter). In the past, citizens never worried about this kind of thing, but now it is full of difficulties.

　　In Shanghai's lanes, if there are forty or fifty households, there will always be a small grocery store open at the entrance of the lane. Returning home in the middle of the night, you can also buy cigarettes and matches from a small window that is open. In such small shops, buttons, needles, thread, and toilet paper can be sold by the piece or by the sheet, and cigarettes can even be purchased individually, which is convenient for the masses and truly meticulous. This is also a characteristic of Shanghai's service industry. Of course, Shanghai has many other characteristics in this regard. It is really regrettable to see that some of these characteristics have disappeared or are on the way to disappearing.

　　Regarding the service industry, Beijing and other cities should learn from Shanghai, and the first thing to do is for Shanghai to maintain and develop its original characteristics.

### 谈“服务性行业”

　　谈“服务性行业”
　　天衣
    如果我们在日常工作中有那么一个“心眼”多多地向着人民的话，就不由你不认为服务性行业是一个重要的行业。
    譬如我们打算在离热闹市区较远的地方盖几座大楼供办公之用，这几座大楼中就有成百上千的人在那里作事，和更多人数的家属在那个地区的一带生活着。这几千人要吃，吃各式各样的东西；要用，用名目繁多的日用品；还有不同爱好的文化生活的要求，还有生活上的其他需要，像理发，洗澡之类。对“服务性行业”注意得不够，往往使得到离市区较远的地方去办公的人，感到生活上的诸多不便。
    领导服务性行业的有些同志对我们过去的传统不感兴趣。北京西郊有一个餐馆，规定顾客必须先定菜、付款、领号码牌，这三个手续办完了，自己找空位子去等；还不仅仅是等，还要一刻不停地注意叫唤号码的地方；等到你的号码被叫上了，就凭号码牌自己去领菜。这个办法大约和机关食堂行的那一套有点类似，只是更繁复了一些。我们在这个地方一点也看不见“服务性”的气息。
    上海是服务性行业最集中的地方，有丰富多样的关于这个行业的经验。很长时期，我们没有重视这些经验。只是在去年有一位受顾客欢迎的理发师被选为上海市政协代表了，才给人以强烈的“行行出状元”的感觉，并使服务性行业得到社会舆论的重视。可是，理发这一行业，已经有七年没有人“收徒弟”了，从前的徒弟，现在也已经是师傅身份。新老师傅的后面，都没有接班人。
    在北京住久了，时常为着有些饮食业的“服务水平低下”，人为地造成座客久等，以致拥挤不堪而大大生气。今年10月中在上海逗留了几天，就马上感觉到上海饮食业的服务水平要比北京高得多。但是上海的饮食业存在着一种不公平的现象：就是“老合营”（在全行业公私合营以前经批准为公私合营的几家）与“新合营”之间采用两种不同的工资制度：前者是工资制，后者是拆账制，后者要比前者拿多得多的报酬。“老合营”跑前一步，反而吃亏不少。据我看，“老合营”是上海一些较有名的餐馆，职工们的服务水平一般都很高。日用品尚且要实行“优质优价”，劳动者为什么得不到公平一些的待遇呢？
    我们更为上海的有些“特色”非但没有发扬而且正在消失的情况惴惴不安。在上海居住过的人，都知道要吃一些点心，只要跑出弄堂（胡同），立刻可以解决问题，现在因“合作化”，归并很多，已不是那样称心如意了。上海有种类繁多的流动摊子，肩挑在市民屋前，出售热点心，许多在上海参观访问过的外国朋友们对于这样无微不至的服务态度，大感兴趣；其实这一类摊子现在已经减少到几乎难得碰见了。上海许多人都在嚷着：电灯坏了，找不到电灯工人来修；皮鞋破了，修皮鞋的摊子不知往哪里去了；大热天找合作社来修理电冰箱，说要过10月后（那是冬天了）派人来修。过去，市民从来不为这一类事操心的，而现在硬是困难重重。
    上海的弄堂凡是有四、五十家住户的，弄堂口总会有一家小杂货店开设着。半夜归来，也能从敞着的一扇小窗里买到香烟和火柴。在这样的小店里，钮扣、针线、手纸都可以论个或论张出售，香烟甚至可以购单枝的，便利群众，真到了无微不至的地步。这也是上海服务性行业的特色。当然，上海在这方面的特色还有不少。当亲眼看到有好些特色湮没了或正在走向消失，这是怪叫人痛惜的。
    关于服务性行业，北京和另外的城市要向上海学习，那首先要上海保持和发扬原来具备的许多特色。
