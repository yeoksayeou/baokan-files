Where Does “Tightness” Come From?
　　He Li
　　Recently, I talked with some rural work cadres and farmers in Hebei about the issue of farmers' lives. They all had a common reflection: "Too deadlocked," "Too tight."
　　The so-called "deadlocked" can be summarized into two main points:
　　First, many agricultural cooperatives have schedules that are too tight. Many cooperatives have not yet made short-term labor arrangements, assigning work points to members for some tasks that don't necessarily need to be done collectively, so they can flexibly manage their own time. Now, most agricultural cooperatives ring the bell to go to the fields from morning to night, working collectively. After work, there is also work point evaluation and ideological review. Members have no free time every day and no free days every month. Sometimes they want to go to the market or visit relatives, but they are afraid of being criticized for asking for leave. We looked at one cooperative and found that each member's dividend labor days were just over two hundred, and very few exceeded three hundred. But in fact, many cooperatives have high quotas and low scores. A full laborer can only earn seven or eight points a day, and a semi-laborer only earns three or four or four or five points. Added to the mandatory labor, there is indeed not much rest time in a year of three hundred and sixty-five days. So some members said: "Collectivization is good, but it's too tight to bear, not free!"
　　Second, precisely because collective labor is too tight, some members' personal private plots have not been well managed; some plots have even been abandoned. Many agricultural cooperatives handle all sideline occupations together in addition to agriculture, only allowing members to participate in sideline occupations within the cooperative, and not even allowing members to operate small sideline occupations themselves. The cooperative distributes agricultural and sideline income only during the wheat harvest and autumn harvest. In this way, a farmer can only get grain and money in June and October of the year, and has no income for the other ten months, often not even enough money for salt and oil. There are always several gatherings in the countryside every year, especially temple fairs, and daughters-in-law and girls like to go and see the fun, but they have no money. Families in mountainous areas used to have fruit trees, and the children had fruit to eat. Now that they have joined the cooperative, some only give members one tree per family, and some don't give any, and the children are greedy, but now they can only watch the fruit trees and drool.
　　In short, overemphasis on the collective has greatly restricted the personal and family lives of members, making farmers feel inconvenienced.
　　Before agricultural cooperation, the "freedom" of individual farmers, such as the so-called "four major freedoms," was capitalist freedom. With this freedom, individual farmers could develop towards capitalism, so it must be restricted. However, we must never oppose or restrict the legitimate freedom of farmers in their lives.
　　This year is the first year of basically realizing advanced cooperation. Most agricultural cooperatives have empty coffers, and many rural work cadres lack experience in managing collective production. Under such circumstances, in order to develop production and concentrate efforts to do a good job in collective undertakings, it is understandable to neglect individual interests to some extent. However, this situation should not continue. Therefore, in the arrangement of production, in addition to continuing to emphasize the development of the public economy, it is also necessary to give necessary arrangements to private plots, family sideline occupations, small sideline occupations, and the time for managing these sideline occupations. Sideline income should be distributed regularly so that members always have pocket money. There should be regular rest after strenuous labor. When there is more farm work during the day, there should be fewer meetings at night. After a period of busy farming, rest should be consciously arranged in conjunction with festivals and meetings. Every year at the beginning and end of the year, there should be "lively celebrations" to liven up the cultural life of the members.

### “紧”从何来

　　“紧”从何来
　　贺笠
    最近我和河北的一些农村工作干部和农民谈起农民生活的问题，他们都有一个共同的反映：“太死巴”，“太紧”。
    所谓“死巴”，归纳起来有两个主要内容：
    第一是许多农业社的劳动时间赶的太紧。许多社到现在还没有作好短期的劳力安排，把某些不必要集体作的活，分别订出工分包给社员，使他们能够机动地处理自己的时间。现在多数农业社是每天从早到晚打钟上地，集体作活。工作完了，还要评工评分，检讨思想。社员天天没有闲时，月月没有闲日，有时候想赶个集，串个亲戚，也怕请假受批评。我们在一个合作社里看，每个社员分红的劳动日不过二百多个，上三百的都很少；但是事实上很多社是定额很高，记分偏低，一个全劳力一天也只能做七、八分，一个半劳力只做三、四分或四、五分，再加上义务工，一年三百六十五天，的确没有多少休息时间。所以有些社员说：“集体化是好，就是紧得受不了，不自由！”
    第二，正由于集体劳动赶的太紧，所以有些社员个人经营的自留地就没有很好地经营；有的地甚至都荒了。许多农业社除了农业以外，副业也是一齐包干，只准社员在社内参加副业，连小副业也不准社员自己经营。社里对农副业收入的分配，却都集中在麦收和秋收时间。这样，一个农民在一年之内除了6月和10月能够分到粮食和钱以外，其他十个月都没有什么进项，常常连称盐打油的钱都没有。农村里一年总有几次集会，特别是过庙会，媳妇姑娘都喜欢去看看热闹，但是没钱。山区的人家过去都有果树，孩子们有果子吃。现在入了社，有的只给社员一家留一棵，有的一棵也没留，孩子们嘴馋，但是现在只能望着果树流口水。
    总之，过分强调集体的结果，使社员个人和家庭生活受到很大限制，使农民感到不方便。
    在农业合作化以前，个体农民的“自由”，例如所谓“四大自由”，是资本主义的自由。个体农民有了这种自由，就可能向资本主义发展，因此必须加以限制。但是，我们绝不能反对和限制农民正当的生活上的自由。
    今年是基本上实现高级合作化的第一年。多数农业社家底空虚，许多农村工作干部缺乏管理集体生产的经验；在这种情况下，为了发展生产，集中力量搞好集体事业，在某种程度上忽略了个体利益，这是可以理解的。但是，这种情况不应该继续下去。因此，在生产的安排上，除了继续强调发展公共经济之外，还必须对自留地、家庭副业、小副业和经营这些副业的时间给以必要的安排。副业收入应该经常分配，使社员经常有零花钱。在紧张劳动之后应该有定期的休息。白天农活比较多的时候，夜间应少开会。在一段农忙之后，应结合节日、会期，有意识地布置休息。每当年头岁尾，应当“闹红火”，使社员们的文化生活活跃起来。
