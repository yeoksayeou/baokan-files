Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 5th: According to TASS, Egyptian Minister of Commerce, Abd-el Nuseir, in answering a question from an "Egyptian Gazette" reporter regarding Egypt's foreign trade, stated that Egypt's guiding principle in its economic policy is to strengthen cooperation with all countries that wish to expand trade with Egypt. Nuseir pointed out that the increasingly consolidated trade relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Eastern European People's Democracies are of great significance to Egypt.

In response to the question of "What impact has the interruption of Egypt's trade relations with Britain and France due to the British and French aggression against Egypt had on the Egyptian economy?", Nuseir said that Egypt has opened up many new foreign markets, which are capable of absorbing all the goods that were previously exported to Britain and France. The People's Republic of China is one of the most important of these new markets.

The Minister of Commerce said that Egypt is expanding its economic ties with the Eastern European People's Democracies. Egypt's exports to these countries have already doubled. Egypt can also buy the equipment it needs from these countries.
