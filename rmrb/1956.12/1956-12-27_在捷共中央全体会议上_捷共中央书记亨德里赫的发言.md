    At the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party
    Comrade Hendrych, Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPCz, Speaks
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The "Red Right Daily," the organ of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, published on December 14th the speech of Comrade Hendrych, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPCz held from December 5th to 6th. The full text is as follows:
    The 20th Congress of the CPSU greatly strengthened the international communist movement. Imperialism felt very uneasy about this and began to launch a fierce political struggle against the international communist movement.
    Now we are witnessing an unprecedented anti-communist propaganda campaign being carried out all over the world. This propaganda is particularly exploiting the Hungarian incident to wantonly slander the Soviet Union and socialist countries, create anti-us public opinion in capitalist countries, and cause some strata in socialist countries to waver. For a long time, imperialists have been strengthening their activities in the ideological field to maintain capitalism, and they are trying every means to get the masses to accept capitalism.
    This activity of theirs is not the result of the strengthening of the bourgeoisie and their ideology in the world, but on the contrary, it is because communism has achieved great successes. The achievements of the Soviet Union in recent years in its international policy in establishing a broad peace front that includes not only the socialist camp but also the vast majority of former colonies and dependent countries have made the imperialists feel very uneasy. This situation has of course also brought serious economic consequences for the capitalists and increased the contradictions within the imperialist camp.
    The line adopted by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the main issues in the struggle for the victory of communism, and its theoretical contributions, especially its theoretical contributions on the issues of peaceful coexistence between the two systems and socialist revolution, have greatly strengthened the international communist movement and aroused a positive response far beyond the scope of the communist parties of various countries.
    The practical results achieved on the basis of these principles, as well as the fierce counter-offensive launched by the imperialists, only prove that the conclusions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the policies that had been implemented before this congress were correct.
    Millions of people can believe that peaceful coexistence between the two systems is possible. The policy of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition can be accepted not only by the broad masses of working people, but also by most of the leading figures of the former colonial countries, and this policy has also been accepted by some Western bourgeois figures because they are not interested in war.
    This development has caused great unease among the imperialists, and they have begun to mobilize their forces, including their forces on the ideological front. Their aim is obvious: to prevent the further smooth development of the policy of peaceful coexistence by creating hotbeds of war to restore the Cold War and by attempting direct aggression as was done in Egypt. For these purposes, the imperialists have also formulated their ideological strategy. Their failure in implementing the "position of strength" policy and their failure in the Cold War have prompted them to launch a political war against socialist countries and the international communist movement, and to launch their so-called struggle for "hearts and minds." From the examples of Hungary and other countries, we can see how fierce a political struggle they launched after their attempts to decide things according to their own interests by force failed.
    At the same time, they are adopting such a tactic: hypocritically propagating a false theory, saying that the relaxation of international tensions will inevitably lead to the relaxation of the ideological struggle, and that the cessation of the ideological struggle is a condition for the relaxation of international tensions, attempting to weaken the ideological struggle of our party. For example, the slogan of freedom of the press that they have put forward is in line with this activity; all the activities they are carrying out have a particularly strong influence on vacillating petty-bourgeois elements, all kinds of credulous people with pacifist attitudes, and other similar people.
    In this regard, it should also be mentioned that they abuse scientific and cultural relations in this regard, and the activities they are carrying out are not entirely unsuccessful. However, the main direction of the ideological war they are waging, especially recently, is aimed at the unity between socialist countries and the unity between communist and workers' parties.
    Recently, various kinds of revisionism have emerged. Comrade Todorović's article also shows revisionist tendencies. Remaining silent about these incorrect opinions means retreating from the principled stand of Marxism-Leninism.
    Imperialist elements are supporting all tendencies and trends that attempt to revise or weaken the fighting and revolutionary nature of scientific socialism. At present, they are fighting especially against the unity between communist parties of various countries and the unity between socialist countries under this banner. If we analyze the developments that contribute to this struggle aimed at weakening the principle of unity of the international communist movement, then we can see that various revisionist theories have recently emerged. The stale Bernsteinism and Kautskyism have been brought out again. In the capitalist world, the theory of "capitalism growing into socialism" is being renovated and disseminated. For example, the Social Democrats of Scandinavian countries are talking about this theory, they are determined to strive to change capitalist society, to establish a new society based on cooperation rather than competition, to establish a "democratic socialism," which of course will not touch the foundations of capitalist exploitation.
    The so-called productive forces theory has gained widespread dissemination. This theory holds that socialism can come naturally through the growth of productive forces without class struggle and revolution, and that the so-called second industrial revolution will help capitalism naturally transform into socialism.
    Kautsky's old theory of ultra-imperialism, which was refuted by Lenin a long time ago, has been brought out again. Kautsky believed that imperialism is a special form of policy, and this statement of his is making a comeback in various forms. Kautsky's statement, as Lenin pointed out, separates policy from the economics of imperialism, conceals the contradictions of imperialism, and will lead to compromise with imperialism.
    Comrade Novotný mentioned Comrade Todorović's article published in the Yugoslav publication "Communist," in which, in addition to some other incorrect inferences, similar revisionist tendencies also appeared. Undoubtedly, our task is to take a clear position on all similar incorrect opinions, because remaining silent on this issue means retreating from the principled stand of Marxism-Leninism.
    There are opinions that imperialism cannot be confused with aggression, as if it were possible to imagine imperialism without aggression, while aggression arises from the very essence of imperialism. This opinion is also very close to Kautskyism.
    Imperialism does not always take aggressive means, not because of imperialism, but because there are strong social forces in the world today, which rely on socialist countries that are sufficient to deter aggression.
    Some Yugoslav comrades justify their position of standing outside the socialist camp by saying that they do not agree to dividing the world into two camps. Comrade Todorović once again emphasized in the above-mentioned article that concluding bilateral agreements is the only possible action to take in the mutual relations between socialist countries. Obviously, this view has nothing in common with the class view and with the class essence of dividing the world and countries. Of course, the policy of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition does not violate this class view. On the contrary, stipulating this policy is because we are sure that our communist system will definitely win.
    Regarding the recent events, I would like to illustrate how obvious reformist and revisionist arguments have been brought out again in the ideological war waged by the imperialist elements against us, with the aim of weakening and shaking the working-class movement.
    In the current situation, there is also a tendency of petty-bourgeois radicalism. This tendency has manifested itself in Hungary and Poland. The Polish party is fighting against them.
    In the current situation, there is also a second tendency—petty-bourgeois radicalism—which puts forward its unique slogans of "pure" general freedom and democracy, which is permeated with great nationalism and chauvinism. This is a somewhat legitimate phenomenon that occurs during every major change and turning point in history.
    Lenin's article "New Times, New Forms of Old Errors," written after the Kronstadt incident in 1921 after fighting against the so-called Workers' Opposition, also helps us to deeply analyze the current situation: "Every specific change in history always causes some change in the form of petty-bourgeois vacillation, which is always adjacent to the proletariat... This vacillation manifests itself in two 'trends'—petty-bourgeois reformism, which is concealed by benign democratic or 'social' democratic terms and weak wishes, and the servile behavior shown to the bourgeoisie; and petty-bourgeois revolutionaryism, which is flamboyant and boastful in words, but in reality is scattered, vain, and mindless."
    If we study the specific situation, look at what has happened recently, if we look for common points to analyze the recent events in some countries, we will certainly come to the conclusion that, in addition to revisionism, it is petty-bourgeois radicalism and revolutionaryism that have manifested themselves in some countries, and when the revolutionary party of the working class has made a major retreat from the class position, it has caused such tragic consequences in Hungary. In our society, which is transforming into a socialist society, in addition to the remnants of the bourgeoisie, petty-bourgeois factors are very strong. This factor is supported by the existence of small-scale production and the old relations with the bourgeoisie, not to mention the influence of the capitalist world.
    Imperialist elements, when carrying out activities against us, naturally focus on these petty-bourgeois elements, who are still numerous. We have to consider this, and recent events have once again convinced us of this.
    Comrade Novotný pointed out the characteristics of the development of the situation in Hungary: Indeed, what happened was largely due to the serious mistakes made by the party and state leaders. However, the struggle to eliminate these mistakes was not led from the working-class position, but from the position of petty-bourgeois radicals, who from the beginning put forward the slogans of "pure" freedom, democracy, independence, and anti-Sovietism. These slogans have always been used by the bourgeoisie to deceive the masses, and taking a small step from these slogans would deprive the working people of their freedom and would lead to petty-bourgeois counter-revolution, while former capitalists, landlords, and White Army officers would be in power at the same time as petty-bourgeois counter-revolution.
    It is worth noting that petty-bourgeois radicals used the inflammatory rhetoric of so-called workers' interests. This is nothing new. Lenin once pointed out this fact when talking about the Kronstadt rebellion: the bourgeoisie is trying to instigate petty-bourgeois anarchists against the interests of the workers under the guise of workers' slogans. We also saw this in Hungary, and partly in Poland; and that is exactly the content of the hostile propaganda spread by Western radio stations. We only need to look at the fact that the former bourgeois elements and petty-bourgeois elements in Hungary were in power under the guise of workers' committees.
    The development process of the Hungarian incident is very similar to those events surrounding the Kronstadt rebellion, and Lenin's analysis of the Kronstadt rebellion also explains how to assess the causes of what happened in Hungary. We must also pay attention to the manifestations of petty-bourgeois radicalism in Poland. As shown in Comrade Gomułka's recent statements, these manifestations are still very strong, and the Polish party is leading a resolute struggle against them. Experience teaches us never to underestimate the manifestations of petty-bourgeois anarchist radicalism, and to ruthlessly expose and smash them. As pointed out by our National Congress, the tendency of petty-bourgeois radicalism is also manifested in our country, especially among some artistic circles, intellectuals, and students.
    The so-called Yugoslav way only thinks of differences, and distinguishes their road from the common basic line of transition to socialism. However, at present, it is particularly necessary for parties of various countries to maintain and strengthen unified action centered on the CPSU.
    The development of society from capitalism to socialism is entirely a unified world process. Some diverse situations expressed within the scope of that unified process are determined by the objective conditions caused by the strong historical, social, and economic development characteristics of various nations or countries, as well as by the international situation at the time of socialist construction. Because of this, each nation (as Lenin said) can and does bring its characteristics to one or another form of democracy, the style of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the speed of changes in various aspects of industrial, agricultural, and commercial social life, and so on. However, if we proceed from the general law of transition from capitalism to socialism, we can correctly understand what is unique to each country in the socialist camp.
    The basic line or its formulation must be based on the Marxist-Leninist theory about the transition from capitalism to socialism, must rely on what is common to all countries building socialism, and especially must rely on the experience of the Soviet Union. The so-called Yugoslav way only thinks of differences and does not correctly relate to what is primary and basic. The arguments used by Yugoslav comrades to promote their views are mostly very strange and show all signs of deliberately distinguishing their road from the common basic line of transition to socialism. Comrade Tito, while promoting his Yugoslav way, also tried (and not accidentally) to reduce the significance of the Soviet example and experience. It is not accidental that Yugoslav newspapers, for example, expressed indignation when talking about our, Bulgarian, and French communist parties. Yugoslav newspapers are indignant because the communist parties of these countries clearly expressed their relationship with the Soviet Union, believing that the Soviet road is applicable in principle to all countries in its main aspects. The correctness of this road has been confirmed by history.
    This is not to say that we are unwilling to utilize the contributions of various countries in enriching the experience of socialist construction. However, in our socialist construction and in the activities of our party, the example of the Soviet Union and the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union remain the basic source of learning. The achievements our party has gained by following the Leninist road also illustrate this point, especially the recent achievements. Recently, our party, loyal to Leninism, has demonstrated its unity and firmness and has gained greater trust from the masses.
    The unity of the communist and workers' parties of various countries based on the unified Marxist-Leninist theory is determined by taking unified actions on various basic issues. This is the long-term experience of the revolutionary workers' movement. Marx and Engels laid the foundation for this revolutionary workers' movement, as well as Lenin in this century, although in different periods, the ways and methods of cooperation and activities of the revolutionary workers' parties are different. However, it is particularly necessary for us to maintain and strengthen the unified actions of our parties now when the imperialists are concentrating all their efforts to launch an attack. Of course, this does not contradict the independent and pioneering activities of the parties of various countries. Long-term experience and the 20th Congress of the CPSU have proved that the center of this unified action is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the development of history has given it this position.
    Past experience has proven that no urgent issue, no serious issue, can be without our answer, without our views on these issues, or without the party's opinion. We must ensure this in the future. This will make a significant contribution to further strengthening the unity of our party and to closer ties between the party and the masses. This will help to further promote the creative spirit of our people in the struggle for the victory of socialism.

    在捷共中央全体会议上
    捷共中央书记亨德里赫的发言
    新华社讯　捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报“红色权利报”12月14日刊载了捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会书记处书记亨德里赫在12月5日到6日举行的捷共中央全体会议上的发言。全文如下：
    苏共二十次代表大会大大加强了国际共产主义运动。帝国主义对此感到很大的不安，开始对国际共产主义运动发动猛烈的政治斗争。
    现在我们亲眼看到在全世界进行的空前的反共宣传活动。这种宣传特别利用匈牙利事件来肆意诽谤苏联和社会主义国家，在资本主义国家制造反对我们的舆论，使社会主义国家中的某些阶层也发生动摇。长时期以来，帝国主义者一直在思想方面加强活动以维护资本主义，他们正在用尽一切办法要广大群众来接受资本主义。
    他们的这种活动并不是资产阶级和他们的意识形态在世界上的地位得到加强的结果，恰恰相反，这是由于共产主义已经取得伟大的成就。苏联在最近几年来在国际政策中在建立不仅包括社会主义阵营而且还包括绝大多数以前的殖民地和附属国在内的广泛的和平阵线方面取得的成就，使帝国主义者感到非常不安。这种情况当然也给资本家们带来了严重的经济后果，并且增加了帝国主义阵营内部的矛盾。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会在争取共产主义胜利的斗争的主要问题上采取的路线，以及它在理论上的贡献，特别是在两个制度和平共处问题和社会主义革命问题上的理论贡献，大大加强了国际共产主义运动，并且引起了远远超出各国共产党的范围以外的积极反应。
    根据这些原则而取得的实际结果，以及帝国主义者所进行的猛烈反攻，只不过证明了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的结论以及在这次大会以前已经在执行的政策是正确的。
    千百万人民可以相信，两个制度和平共处是可能的。和平共处和和平竞赛的政策，不仅可以为广大劳动人民群众所接受，而且也可以为以前的大部分殖民地国家的领导人物所接受，这种政策也已经为某些西方资产阶级人士所接受，因为他们对战争不感兴趣。
    这种事态发展引起帝国主义者很大的不安，他们已经开始动员他们的力量，其中包括他们的思想战线上的力量。他们的目的是很明显的：用制造战争温床以恢复冷战的办法和像在埃及所做的那样尝试进行直接侵略的办法，来阻止和平共处政策的进一步的顺利发展。为了这些目的，帝国主义者还制定了他们的思想战略。他们在执行“实力地位”政策方面的失败和在冷战中的失败，促使他们对社会主义国家和国际共产主义运动发动政治战争，发动他们所谓的争取“人心”的斗争。从匈牙利和其他国家的例子我们可以看到，他们在企图用武力来按照自己的利益决定事情而没有得逞以后发动了怎样猛烈的政治斗争。
    同时，他们正在采取这样一种策略：伪善地宣扬一种错误的理论，说什么国际紧张局势的缓和一定会导致思想斗争的缓和，思想斗争的停止是国际紧张局势缓和的条件，企图借此削弱我们党的思想斗争。例如，他们所提出的新闻自由的口号就是配合这种活动的；他们所进行的一切活动对动摇的小资产阶级分子、各种各样抱有非战主义态度的轻信的人们以及其他类似的人特别有影响。
    关于这一点，也应该提到他们在这一方面滥用科学和文化关系，而且他们所进行的活动也并不是完全不成功的。但是，他们所进行的思想战争的主要方针，特别是在最近，却是针对着社会主义国家之间的团结以及共产党和工人党之间的团结的。
    最近各种各样的修正主义都露面了。托多罗维奇同志的文章，也出现了修正主义的倾向。对这些不正确意见保持缄默，就意味着从马克思列宁主义的原则立场后退。
    帝国主义分子正在支持一切试图修改或者削弱科学的社会主义的战斗的革命性质的倾向和趋向。目前，他们就是在这种旗帜下特别对各国共产党之间的团结和社会主义国家之间的团结进行斗争的。如果我们分析一下有助于这种以削弱国际共产主义运动的团结原则为目的的斗争的事态发展，那末我们就可以看出，最近各种各样的修正主义理论都露面了。陈腐的伯恩斯坦主义和考茨基主义再一次被搬了出来。在资本主义世界里，
  “资本主义长入社会主义”的理论正被整旧翻新地拿出来传播。例如，斯堪的纳维亚国家的社会党人就在谈论这种理论，他们决心争取改变资本主义社会，建立以合作为基础而不是以竞争为基础的新社会，建立一种“民主的社会主义”，这当然是不会碰到资本主义剥削的基础的。
    所谓生产力学说获得了广泛的传播。这种理论认为，通过生产力的增长而不经过阶级斗争和革命，社会主义就可以自然而然到来，并且说，所谓第二次产业革命将会有助于资本主义自然而然地转变为社会主义。
    很久以前就受到列宁驳斥的考茨基的关于超帝国主义的陈旧理论又重新搬了出来。考茨基认为，帝国主义是一种特殊的政策形式，他这种说法正在以各种各样的形式卷土重来。考茨基的说法，正像列宁所指明的，把政策和帝国主义的经济分离开了，掩饰了帝国主义的矛盾，并且会造成同帝国主义的妥协。
    诺沃提尼同志提到了托多罗维奇同志在南斯拉夫刊物“共产主义者”上所发表的文章，在这篇文章中，除了有其他一些不正确的推论以外，也出现了类似的修正主义的倾向。无疑，我们的任务在于对一切类似的不正确的意见采取明确的立场，因为在这种问题上保持缄默，就意味着从马克思列宁主义的原则立场后退。
    有的意见认为，不能够把帝国主义同侵略混为一谈，好像有可能设想有不进行侵略的帝国主义似的，而侵略正是从帝国主义的本质中产生出来的。这种意见也是十分接近考茨基主义的。
    帝国主义不一定总是采取侵略手段，这一点并不是由于帝国主义，而是由于今天世界上存在着强大的社会力量，这种力量是依靠足以制止侵略的社会主义国家的。
    有些南斯拉夫同志为他们所采取的置身于社会主义阵营之外的立场进行辩解，他们说，他们不同意把世界分成两个阵营。托多罗维奇同志在上述的文章中再一次强调指出，缔结双边协定是在社会主义国家之间相互关系中唯一可能采取的行动。显然，这种观点同阶级观点以及同划分世界和各国的阶级实质是没有什么共同之处的。当然，和平共处政策和和平竞赛政策，并不违背这种阶级观点。相反，规定这种政策是由于我们肯定相信我们的共产主义制度一定会获得胜利。
    关于最近的事件，我希望说明，在帝国主义分子对我们进行的思想战争中，明显的改良主义和修正主义的论点，是怎样重新被搬了出来，目的是削弱工人阶级运动和使它动摇。
    在目前局面中，还出现了小资产阶级激进主义的趋向。这种趋向在匈牙利和波兰都已表现出来。波兰党正在对它们进行斗争。
    在目前局面中，还有第二种趋向——小资产阶级激进主义——出现，提出了它特有的关于“纯粹的”一般自由和民主的口号，这是浸透了大民族主义和沙文主义的趋向。这是在历史上发生一切重大改变和转折的时候出现的在某种程度上是合法的现象。
    在1921年喀琅斯塔得事件后，列宁在跟所谓工人反对派斗争后写的“新时光，新形式的旧错误”这篇文章也对我们深入分析当前局势有帮助：“历史上每一次特有的转变，总是引起小资产阶级动摇性在形式上的某种变动，这种动摇随时都与无产阶级毗邻着……这种动摇性表现为两种‘潮流’——小资产阶级的改良主义，即借良善民主主义或‘社会’民主主义词句和软弱愿望掩盖着，而在资产阶级面前所表现出的奴仆行为；以及小资产阶级的革命主义，即口头上的威风凛凛、骄大浮夸，实际上则是散漫、虚浮和毫无头脑的空架子。”
    如果我们研究具体情况，看看最近发生了什么事情，如果我们寻找对某些国家最近发生的事件进行分析的共同点，我们一定会得到这样的结论：除了修正主义以外，正是小资产阶级激进主义和革命主义在某些国家里表现出来，并且当在工人阶级的革命政党中发生了从阶级立场大举后退情况的时候，在匈牙利造成了这样悲惨的后果。在我们这个正在转变成社会主义社会的社会里，除了资产阶级残余外，小资产阶级因素非常强烈。这种因素由于小规模生产的存在和同资产阶级的旧关系而得到支持，更不用说资本主义世界的影响了。
    帝国主义分子在进行反对我们的活动的时候，自然是着眼在这些人数仍然众多的小资产阶级分子身上。我们得考虑这一点，最近的事态再度使我们深信这一点。
    诺沃提尼同志指出了匈牙利事态发展的特点：的确，发生的事情在很大程度上是由于党和国家的领导犯了严重的错误。但是，为消除这些错误而进行的斗争不是从工人阶级立场来进行领导的，而是从小资产阶级激进分子的立场来进行领导的，小资产阶级激进分子从一开始就提出了要“纯粹的”自由、民主、独立和反苏的口号，这些口号一直是资产阶级为欺骗群众所使用的，而从这些口号再走一小步就会剥夺了劳动人民的自由，就会走到小资产阶级反革命，而前资本家、地主和白卫军军官就会跟小资产阶级反革命一起同时当权的。
    值得注意的是，小资产阶级激进分子利用了所谓工人利益这样的煽惑之词。这不是什么新东西。列宁曾经在谈到喀琅斯塔得叛乱事件的时候指出这个事实：资产阶级正在设法在工人的口号的掩饰下煽动小资产阶级无政府主义者反对工人的利益。这一点我们也在匈牙利看到了，并且部分地也在波兰看到了；而那也正是西方的广播电台所散布的敌意宣传的内容。我们只要看一看在匈牙利以前的资产阶级分子和小资产阶级分子是怎样在工人委员会的伪装下面当权的事实就够了。
    匈牙利事件的发展过程是和环绕着喀琅斯塔得的叛乱的那些事件非常类似的，而列宁对喀琅斯塔得的叛乱的分析也说明了应该怎样来估价匈牙利所发生的事情的起因。我们也必须注意在波兰的小资产阶级激进主义的表现。正像哥穆尔卡同志最近几次声明中所显示的，这些表现现在仍然很强烈，波兰党正在领导着对它们进行坚决的斗争。经验教导我们，决不要低估小资产阶级的无政府激进主义的表现，并且要无情地揭露和粉碎它们。正像我们的全国代表会议所指出的，小资产阶级激进主义的倾向也在我们国家里表现出来，特别是在一部分艺术界、知识分子和学生中间。
    所谓南斯拉夫的方式只想到差异，把他们的道路同过渡到社会主义的共同的基本路线区别开来。但是，目前各国党特别有必要保持和加强以苏共为中心的统一行动。
    社会从资本主义到社会主义的发展完全是一个统一的世界性的过程。在那个统一的过程的范围以内所表现出来的一些多样的情况，是由各个民族或国家的强烈的历史、社会和经济的发展特点引起的客观条件以及由进行社会主义建设的时候所处的国际形势所决定的。由于这样，每个民族（正像列宁所说的）能够把、而且确实把它的特点带到一种或另一种民主形式、无产阶级专政的样式和工业、农业、商业的社会生活的各个方面的改变的速度等等上面去。但是如果我们从资本主义过渡到社会主义的一般规律出发的话，我们可以正确地理解社会主义阵营里的每个国家所特有的东西。
    基本路线或它的拟订必须是根据马克思列宁主义关于资本主义过渡到社会主义的学说，必须依靠一切建设社会主义的国家共同的东西，特别是必须依靠苏联的经验。所谓南斯拉夫的方式只想到差异，而没有正确地联系到什么是主要的和基本的东西。南斯拉夫同志们用来宣传他们的看法的那些论点大都是非常奇怪的，并且显示了故意把他们的道路同过渡到社会主义的共同的基本路线区别开来的一切迹象。铁托同志在抬高他的南斯拉夫方式的同时，还试图（而且不是偶然地）缩小苏联的榜样和经验的意义。南斯拉夫的报纸，譬如说，在谈到我们的、保加利亚的和法国的共产党的时候表示愤慨，也不是偶然的。南斯拉夫报纸愤慨，是因为这些国家的共产党清楚地表示了它们同苏联的关系，认为苏联的道路就它的各个主要方面来说，在原则上对各国都是适用的。这条道路的正确性已经为历史所证实。
    这并不是说，我们就不愿意利用各个国家在丰富社会主义建设的经验方面的贡献了。但是，在我国社会主义建设和我们党的活动中，苏联的榜样和苏联共产党的经验，仍然是学习的基本源泉。我们党由于走列宁主义的道路而获得的成果，同样也说明了这一点，特别是最近的成果。在最近，忠于列宁主义的我们的党表现了它的团结和坚定，并且取得了群众的更大信任。
    以统一的马克思列宁主义学说为基础的各国共产党和工人党的团结，决定于在各种基本问题上采取统一的行动。这是革命的工人运动长期以来的经验。为这个革命的工人运动奠定基础的，是马克思和恩格斯，以及这个世纪的列宁，虽然在不同的时期中，革命的工人政党进行合作和进行活动的方式方法各有不同。但是，正当现在帝国主义者集中全力发动进攻的时候，我们特别有必要保持和加强我们各个党的统一行动。当然，这同各国的党进行独立的和首创性的活动并不抵触。长期的经验和苏共第二十次代表大会都证明了，这种统一行动的中心是苏联共产党，历史的发展给了它这样的地位。
    过去的经验证明，任何迫切的问题，任何严重的问题，都不能没有我们的回答，没有我们对这些问题的观点，或没有党的意见。将来我们必须保证这一点。这一点对进一步加强我们党的团结，对更加密切党和群众的联系，将有重大意义的贡献。这将有助于进一步发扬我国人民在争取社会主义胜利的斗争中的创造精神。
