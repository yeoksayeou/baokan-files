The Tongxin Cooperative Raises Pigs with Less Feed
Allocate a certain amount of land to plant several seasons of feed a year
Sell each pig when it reaches one hundred and twenty pounds
    The Tongxin Agricultural Cooperative in Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, has achieved remarkable results in pig production. As of now, the cooperative has more than 900 publicly and privately raised pigs, averaging three pigs per member household. Some members who raise the most pigs raise as many as eight pigs per year.
    The cooperative's success in pig production is mainly due to the following effective measures: First, allocate a certain amount of cultivated land for growing feed. The Tongxin Agricultural Cooperative has four thousand mu of cultivated land, of which sixty mu are used for growing feed crops. In the feed fields, in addition to planting barley, the main crops are carrots, green vegetables, and radishes. The latter three are planted using intercropping methods: carrots are intercropped with cabbage as they are about to be harvested, and cabbage is intercropped with radishes as they are about to be harvested. Second, each pig is only raised for half a year, and is sold when it reaches one hundred and twenty pounds. This method of raising pigs is very economical - the feed harvested from one mu of land can raise seven pigs; the same amount of feed can produce more meat.
    The result of Tongxin Agricultural Cooperative adopting the above effective measures to raise more pigs is that it not only solved the fertilizer problem and promoted the increase in crop yields, but also directly benefited from raising pigs. For example, last year the yield of rice was only 430 jin per mu, but this year, due to abundant fertilizer, the yield of rice was 441 jin per mu, an increase of 11 jin, calculated on the basis of two crops. Another example is that the cost of each piglet is 10 yuan, and it takes 26 yuan for feed to raise it to 120 jin in more than five months, for a total cost of 36 yuan. Each pig can be sold for 40 yuan, and the manure from each pig can be sold for 13 yuan, for a total of 53 yuan. After deducting the cost, raising a pig can yield a profit of 17 yuan. Therefore, the members are very enthusiastic about raising pigs.
    The Tongxin Agricultural Cooperative plans to increase the number of pigs raised to 1,600 next year; by 1962, it will raise 4,000 pigs. At that time, in addition to the pigs raised publicly by the cooperative, each member household will be able to raise an average of ten pigs per year. While developing pig production, they also plan to gradually expand the feed base year by year. By 1962, the feed fields will be expanded to 570 mu (accounting for 15% of the cooperative's cultivated land). If this plan can be realized, by 1962, each mu of land in the cooperative can be allocated the manure of one pig (currently, each mu of land has about a quarter of a pig's manure). The cadres and members of the cooperative unanimously believe that by 1962, the yield of rice per mu can be increased to 630 jin; and the yield of wheat per mu can reach 360 jin, which is also not a problem.

    Linqu District Achieves Success in Pig Breed Improvement
    First-generation hybrids grow fast, have thin skin, and thick meat
    Double-mating method enables breeding of more high-quality pigs
    This year, the Linqu Special District of Shandong Province bred more than 100,000 first-generation hybrid pigs, a fourfold increase compared to last year. Linqu and Junan counties, which have done a good job in pig breed improvement, bred first-generation hybrid pigs accounting for about 30% of the total number of pigs raised in the county this year.
    This first-generation hybrid pig, bred from Yorkshire and other high-quality pigs and local pigs, generally grows thirty to forty jin more meat per year than local pigs under the same conditions. The first-generation hybrid pigs have the advantages of fast growth, thin skin, and thick meat, but the second generation will degenerate. The Nan Dao Village Agricultural Cooperative in Linqu County created a method of double-mating with different breeds, which enables each litter of high-quality pigs to breed seventeen or eighteen piglets, five or six more than the general mating method, and the quality is also very good. This experience has now been widely promoted throughout the entire district. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Dengta Cooperative Raises and Sells Many Pigs
    Solved the problem of piglet source and feed through self-reliance
    Averaged eighty-six fattened pigs sold per month for nine months
    The Dengta Agricultural Cooperative in Shiyang Township, Huayang County, Sichuan is an agricultural cooperative that raises a large number of pigs and frequently sells fattened pigs. From the beginning of March to the end of November, this cooperative has sold 776 fattened pigs, averaging 86 pigs per month. Currently, the cooperative is still raising 1,515 pigs, 22% more than the same period last year.
    The Dengta Agricultural Cooperative started developing pig production by increasing the number of sows. At the end of last year, they only had 47 sows, and the source of pigs mainly relied on market supply, which was both inconvenient and expensive. Many poor members could not afford to buy pigs to raise. This spring, the cooperative allocated a sum of funds and sent people to other places to purchase sows. The number of publicly and privately raised sows gradually increased to 172, and there are often many piglets born. For poor members who have no money to buy piglets, the cooperative lends them public piglets, and they repay them after the pigs grow fat and are sold for money. This solves the problem of piglet source.
    In order to solve the feed problem, the cooperative specifically allocated 60 mu of land as a feed base, planting feed crops all year round. The members' self-retained 200 mu of land also has 120 mu planted with feed. In addition, they also adopted the method of increasing intercropping to plant more than 100 mu of sweet potatoes, 57 mu of radishes, and more than 1,000 mu of broad bean seedlings. Some feeds that cannot be eaten are ensiled. The pigs in this cooperative never lack green feed.
    Due to the frequent sale of fattened pigs, the Dengta Cooperative's production funds are never tight. This year, with the increase in fertilizer, the total grain output of the cooperative increased by 9.6%. (Xinhua News Agency)

    The Fourth Team of Shengli Cooperative Has Good Pig Raising Methods
    Self-raised sows breed piglets, and the entire team consciously prevents epidemics
    No pigs in any household have had hog cholera in the past three years
    The Fourth Production Team of the Shengli Agricultural Cooperative in Dabangniu Township, Liaozhong County, Liaoning Province, has implemented the pig-raising method of "self-raising, self-breeding, and conscious epidemic prevention." In the past three years, no pigs in the entire team have had hog cholera. The 36 member households now raise an average of 5.28 pigs per household. This year, the team's income from pig raising accounted for 48.8% of the agricultural income, with an average pig raising income of more than 130 yuan per household.
    The biggest feature of this production team's pig raising is "self-raising, self-breeding, and conscious epidemic prevention." The entire team raises a total of 28 sows, with an average of eight sows for every ten households. In this way, not only can they solve the problem of piglet source themselves, but also reduce the chance of hog cholera transmission because they do not buy pigs from other places. In the entire team, everyone, young and old, knows the serious harm of hog cholera to pigs, so they consciously abide by the epidemic prevention system. They do not buy dead pigs, sick pigs, or pork of unknown origin to eat. For example, when member Du Baoyu's daughter-in-law went to visit her parents, she did not eat the pork because she knew it was sick pork, for fear of bringing pig infectious diseases home. When member Tian Xu went to another village to mate pigs, he heard that there was hog cholera in Xiaobangniu Village, so he detoured around it. That's how there has been no hog cholera in this team for the past three years. (Xinhua News Agency)

    发动群众多想办法，生猪生产必能发展
    同心社养猪多饲料省
    划出一定的土地一年种几季饲料
    每头猪养到一百二十斤重就卖掉
    江苏昆山县同心农业社的养猪生产，已获得了显著成绩。截至目前为止，全社公养与私养的生猪已达九百多头，平均每户社员养猪三头。其中养猪最多的社员，每户年养八头之多。
    这个社的养猪生产所以能取得这样大的成绩，主要是采取了如下几个有效办法：第一、划出一定耕地种饲料。同心农业社共有四千亩耕地，用作种饲料作物的就有六十亩。在饲料田中，除种元麦外，主要种胡萝卜、青菜、萝卜。后三种是采用套种的办法：胡萝卜将收时套种白菜，白菜将收时套种萝卜。第二、每头猪只养半年，养到一百二十斤重就卖出。这样养猪，十分经济——每亩地所收的饲料可养七头猪；用同样数量的饲料，可以多产肉。
    同心农业社采取上述有效办法多养猪的结果，不仅解决了肥料问题，促进了农作物产量的增加，还从养猪直接得到了实利。如去年每亩仅产稻四百三十斤，今年因为肥料充裕，按两熟计算，每亩就产稻四百四十一斤，多产了十一斤。再如每头小猪成本为十元钱，养五个多月达一百二十斤，须花饲料费二十六元，共花三十六元。每头猪可卖四十元，每头猪的粪肥可卖十三元，共卖五十三元。除掉成本，养一头猪可得利十七元。因此，社员们养猪的情绪很高。
    同心农业社计划在明年增养到一千六百头猪；到1962年，要养到四千头。那时候，除社里公养的猪以外，每户社员平均每年可养猪十头。在发展养猪生产的同时，他们还计划逐年扩大饲料基地。到1962年，要把饲料田扩大到五百七十亩（占社里耕地面积的15％）。这个计划如能实现，到1962年，全社每亩地可摊到一口猪的粪肥（现在每亩地约有四分之一口猪的粪肥）。这个社的干部和社员一致认为：到1962年，稻子的亩产量可提高到六百三十斤；小麦亩产三百六十斤，也是没有问题的。　（计商）
    临沂区猪种改良有成绩
    杂交第一代生长快皮薄肉膘厚
    两次交配法使良种猪繁殖得多
    山东省临沂专区今年繁殖的杂交种猪第一代达十万多头，比去年增加四倍。生猪品种改良工作作得较好的临沂、莒南两个县，今年繁殖的杂交种猪第一代占全县养猪总数的30％左右。
    这种由约克夏等良种猪和当地猪交配生出来的杂交种猪第一代，在同样条件下一般每年能比当地猪多长三、四十斤肉。杂交种猪第一代具有生长快、皮薄和肉膘厚等优点，但是第二代就要退化。临沂县南道村农业社创造的用不同品种两次交配的方法，使良种猪每窝能繁殖小猪十七、八头，比一般交配方法多生五、六头，而且质量也很好，这一经验现在已经在全专区普遍推广了。　（新华社）
    灯塔社大量养猪多卖猪
    自力解决了仔猪来源和饲料问题
    九个月平均每月卖肥猪八十六头
    四川华阳县石羊乡灯塔农业社是个大量养猪和经常出卖肥猪的农业社。这个社从3月初到11月底已经卖出肥猪七百七十六只，平均每月出卖八十六只。现在全社还养着一千五百一十五只，比去年同期多22％。
    灯塔农业社发展生猪是从增养母猪着手的。去年年底他们只有四十七头母猪，猪源主要仰赖于市场供应，既不方便，价钱又贵。好些贫苦社员买不起猪养。今年春天，社里抽出一笔资金，派人到外地去购买了母猪，公养和私养的母猪逐渐发展到一百七十二头，经常都有许多小猪出生。没钱买小猪的贫苦社员，社里就将公有小猪贷给他们，待猪长肥，卖成钱以后再还。这样就解决了猪源问题。
    为了解决饲料问题，社里专门拿出了六十亩地作为饲料基地，常年种植饲料作物。社员自留的二百亩土地，也有一百二十亩种饲料。此外，他们还采用增种间种的办法种植了一百多亩红薯、五十七亩萝卜、一千多亩蚕豆秧子。一些吃不了的饲料都青贮起来。这个社的生猪从来不缺青饲料吃。
    由于经常有肥猪出卖，灯塔社的生产资金从来不感局促。今年肥料增多，全社粮食总产量增加9.6％。　（新华社）
    胜利社四队养猪办法好
    自养母猪繁殖仔猪全队自觉防疫
    三年来各户没有一头猪发生猪瘟
    辽宁省辽中县大邦牛乡胜利农业社第四生产队实行“自养自繁、自觉防疫”的养猪办法，三年来全队没有一头猪发生猪瘟，三十六户社员现在平均每户养猪五点二八头。今年全队养猪收入占农业收入的48.8％，平均每户养猪收入一百三十来元。
    这个生产队养猪的最大特点是“自养自繁、自觉防疫”。全队一共养母猪二十八头，平均每十户就有八头，这样，不仅自己可以解决仔猪的来源问题，而且因为不到外地买猪也减少了猪瘟传染的机会。在全队，无论男女老少都知道猪瘟对生猪的严重危害，因此都自觉地遵守防疫制度。他们不买死猪、病猪和来历不明的猪肉吃。如社员杜宝玉的儿媳妇去娘家串门时，知道是病猪肉就没有吃，怕把猪传染病带到家来。社员田绪到外村去配猪种时，听说小邦牛村有猪瘟，便绕开走。就是这样，这个队里三年来没有发生猪瘟。　（新华社）
