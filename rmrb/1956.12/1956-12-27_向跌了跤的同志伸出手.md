Extend a hand of friendship to warmly help up a comrade who has fallen in life, enabling them to correct their mistakes and continue forward. There are many such examples in our Party life. Here is one such example.

Stumbled

This happened last December.

Chen Hongwen, a Communist Party member and director of the Zhengda Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Ninghai County, Zhejiang Province, was placed on probation within the Party for one year. This was because after transferring from the military, he became arrogant and complacent, had a blurred line between the enemy and us, often associated with a bad element, and misappropriated public funds of the village for extravagant spending, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses.

On the evening he was punished, Chen Hongwen kept regretfully thinking about one thing: From now on, others would no longer trust him, and no one would look up to him anymore.

How to Treat Him

After Chen Hongwen was punished, although he continued to hold the position of director of the cooperative in administrative terms, the views of some cadres and members around him were different from the past. Especially seeing that Chen Hongwen had not been working with energy these days, some people started to gossip.

"Hongwen has been punished!"

"Ah, we have to be more careful from now on, and can't follow people who make mistakes anymore!"

Once, cooperative cadre Yu Defu was talking about work with a Party member in the cooperative. As soon as they saw Chen Hongwen coming, they quickly shut their mouths.

Chen Hongwen felt very sad when he saw this. It was becoming increasingly difficult to lead the work in the cooperative.

In fact, it is not surprising that some people are gossiping. Although Chen Hongwen has not been transferred for very long, he has already made a deep impression on people. He is an active and capable cadre, bold and decisive, but he is arrogant, does not accept collective constraints, likes to show off everywhere, and looks down on everyone.

Chen Hongwen made a mistake, and many people gossiped about it. How should we help and educate him? This question aroused the attention of the branch leadership.

After Chen Hongwen was punished, branch secretary Zhu Guanwu had talked to him once, encouraging him to work hard and correct his mistakes with practical actions. At the time, it seemed that this matter was over. However, it now appears that for a Party organization, punishing a Party member who has made a mistake is only the beginning of the work. To help Chen Hongwen establish the determination to correct his mistakes, and to educate the masses to change their incorrect views of him, a lot of effort is still needed.

Therefore, Wang Jiong, a Party cadre sent by the Chengguan Town Committee of the Communist Party of China to assist in the work of this village, and the branch secretary jointly studied the matter. They believed that the reason why some people had such views of Chen Hongwen was mainly due to a lack of clear understanding of the Party's policy of treating illnesses to save people towards comrades who have made mistakes. It is necessary to first explain this principle to everyone so that everyone has a correct attitude towards Chen Hongwen. In addition, it is also necessary to step up education for Chen Hongwen, help him recognize and correct his mistakes, and encourage him to move forward.

Therefore, branch secretary Zhu Guanwu had casual talks with some Party members and cadres in the cooperative about how to treat comrades who have made mistakes. Zhu Guanwu said: "It is true that Hongwen's mistake is his own fault. But in the past, we also did not care enough about him, and we did not point out his mistakes and help him correct them when his mistakes first appeared. This cannot be said to be a fault. Now our responsibility is to enthusiastically help him correct his mistakes in accordance with the policy of treating illnesses to save people, so that he will not continue to make mistakes!"

"Yes, we must help him correct his mistakes!" After the Party members communicated, their understanding was improved, and they understood their due responsibility when a comrade made a mistake.

Encouragement and Trust

At the same time, Comrade Wang Jiong also had individual talks with Chen Hongwen.

At the beginning, Chen Hongwen worriedly said: "I have been punished, and the organization and comrades will never have a good impression of me in the future. Can this still be changed?"

"It can be changed," Comrade Wang Jiong said: "The purpose of the organization punishing a comrade is for education. As long as you can recognize your mistakes and correct them with practical actions, the organization and comrades will still trust you."

This conversation with Comrade Wang Jiong greatly encouraged Chen Hongwen. He felt that the Party was truly helping and urging him to make progress.

"Okay, the facts are always the facts. I can't just be afraid of people's comments when I make mistakes. Look at my actions in the future!" He decided to cheer up.

From then on, he always actively worked on the tasks assigned to Chen Hongwen by the leadership. The attitude of some cadres around him was no longer the same as when he was first punished. Everyone still discussed and studied work with him as usual. This gave Chen Hongwen a lot of comfort. However, shame and guilt still could not leave him. Apart from work, he seemed to have no interest in anything else. Originally, he was a person who liked to talk a lot, but now he has become dull and lonely.

At that time, it was the tense time of merging cooperatives and upgrading. After leadership research, it was decided that the Zhengda Agricultural Cooperative, which Chen Hongwen originally led, should merge with the nearby Guangming Cooperative to form an advanced cooperative. When studying the list of candidates for the establishment preparation committee, the branch analyzed that in addition to his shortcomings, Chen Hongwen had led the cooperative well and had a set of methods, so it suggested electing him as a member of the establishment preparation committee.

Getting Up

The trust of the collective moved Chen Hongwen very much, and his determination to correct his mistakes became stronger. When dealing with the issue of Chunhua joining the cooperative, he visited the homes of the members of the cooperative, persuaded and mobilized them, and dispelled the members' various ideological concerns about Chunhua joining the cooperative. However, in carrying out this work, he also encountered some resistance. Individual members, for personal reasons, disregarded the interests of the cooperative and refused to let Chunhua join the cooperative. The masses were very dissatisfied with this behavior, but he did not dare to boldly put it forward for everyone to analyze, discuss, and conduct appropriate criticism. After the branch leadership discovered this situation, they helped him and encouraged him to work boldly, and also discussed with him the method of educating these backward members. After education, the thoughts of individual members were cleared, and the issue of Chunhua joining the cooperative was smoothly resolved.

However, when discussing the issue of handcarts joining the cooperative, Chen Hongwen found that some members had concerns about handcarts joining the cooperative, so he took the lead and bought back the handcarts that had already been sold and put them into the cooperative. Under the leadership of Chen Hongwen, all eighteen handcarts in the entire cooperative were put into the cooperative. The leadership discovered this fact and praised him in a timely manner. These facts increased Chen Hongwen's prestige among the members, and after the end of the cooperative merger work, everyone elected him as the deputy director of the advanced cooperative.

The members believed in him, and Chen Hongwen felt even more that he should work better for the cooperative. This year, the cooperative suffered three typhoon disasters in a row. He stayed up for several nights, leading the members to fight against the strong winds and floods. One day, cooperative director Zhu Guanwu suddenly fell ill. He and the cooperative cadres sent him to the hospital overnight, and he took on the burden of leading the entire cooperative. Late at night, the wind was strong, the rain was heavy, and the night was so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. Chen Hongwen led the cooperative cadres, groping in the dark, to check the housing situation of the members from house to house. After discovering that the houses of twenty-seven members in the entire cooperative had been blown down by the strong wind, he worked with everyone to find ways to help them settle down one by one. The masses were very moved by Chen Hongwen's concern for the well-being of the members.

The cooperative's production and disaster relief work, under his leadership and the leadership of other cadres, won the first place in the entire town.

In September of this year, the town carried out a summary and evaluation, and Chen Hongwen was rated as a first-class outstanding cadre in the town.

"Chen Hongwen has changed!" Everyone said so, and the leadership also saw it very clearly. The branch believed that he had the conditions for revoking the punishment. On September 16, after discussion at the branch member meeting, it was decided to revoke Chen Hongwen's punishment of probation within the Party in advance. When Chen Hongwen received the notice of the formal approval decision from the county supervision committee, he was so moved that he couldn't speak. He said:

"If it weren't for the Party and comrades helping me and urging me to correct my mistakes with the attitude of treating illnesses to save people, I don't know what path I would have gone wrong on!"

### 向跌了跤的同志伸出手

    向跌了跤的同志伸出手
    马如宝
    伸出友爱的手，热诚地扶起一个在生活中跌倒了的同志，使他改正错误，继续前进。这样的事例，在我们党的生活里是很多的。这里就有这样一个例子。
    跌跤了
    这是发生在去年12月里的事。
    共产党员、浙江宁海县城关镇正大农业社主任陈宏文受到了留党察看一年的处分。这是因为他从部队转业下来后，骄傲自满，敌我界限不清，和一个坏分子经常拉拉扯扯，并且挪用村里公款，大肆挥霍，引起了群众的不满。
    在受处分的当天晚上，陈宏文一直悔恨地想着一件事情：从今以后别人再也不信任自己了，再也不会有人看得起自己了。
    怎样对待他
    陈宏文受了处分之后，虽然在行政上仍旧担任了社主任的职务，但是周围的一部分干部和社员对他的看法和过去却不相同了。特别是看到陈宏文这几天工作没有劲，有些人就议论开了。
    “宏文受了处分！”
    “啊，今后可得注意点了，不能再跟着犯错误的人跑啦！”
    有一次，社干部俞德福和社里的一个党员一起在谈工作，一看陈宏文走来，就连忙闭住嘴巴不响了。
    陈宏文看到这些，心里很难过。在社里的领导工作是越来越难做了。
    其实，有些人议论纷纷，也不是什么奇怪的事。因为虽然陈宏文转业还不很久，但是他给人家的印象已经很深刻。他，工作积极肯干，大胆泼辣，是一个很有才能的干部，但就是骄傲自大，不受集体的约束，处处好表现自己，谁也看不起。
    陈宏文犯了错误，不少人议论纷纷。应该怎样去帮助他、教育他呢？这个问题引起了支部领导上的重视。
    在陈宏文受了处分后，支部书记朱官武曾经找他谈了一次话，鼓励他好好工作，以实际行动来改正自己的错误。照当时的看法，这件事情好像已经结束了。但是，现在看来作为一个党组织来说，对一个犯了错误的党员进行了处分，仅仅是工作的开始。要帮助陈宏文树立改正错误的决心，要教育群众扭转对他的不正确看法，还需要下很大的功夫。
    因此，中共城关镇委员会派来这个村协助工作的党员干部王浻和支部书记共同作了研究。认为有些人之所以会对陈宏文产生这样的看法，主要是对党的对待犯错误的同志采取治病救人的方针认识不清。必须首先把这个道理向大家讲清楚，使大家对陈宏文有一个正确的态度。另外还必须加紧对陈宏文进行教育，帮助他认识错误，改正错误，鼓励他前进。
    于是，支部书记朱官武就找社里的一些党员和干部漫谈怎样对待犯错误的同志的问题。朱官武说：“宏文犯了错误，固然是他自己不好。但是过去我们对他关心也不够，没有当他错误刚刚露头的时候，就给他指出来，帮助他改正，这不能不说是个过失。现在我们的责任就是要照着治病救人的方针热情地去帮助他改过来，使他不要再错下去！”
    “对，要帮助他改过来！”党员们通过交谈后，认识提高了，他们明白了当一个同志犯了错误的时候，自己应有的责任。
    鼓励和信任
    在此同时，王浻同志也找陈宏文进行了个别谈话。
    开始，陈宏文耽心地说：“我受了处分，往后组织上和同志们对我的印象总不会好了，这还能改变得过来吗？”
    “能够改变的”，王浻同志说：“组织上处分一个同志的目的是为了教育，只要自己能认识错误，用实际行动来改正错误，组织上和同志们仍然会信任你的。”
    和王浻同志的这一次谈话，陈宏文受到了很大的鼓舞，他感到党是真正在帮助和督促自己进步。
    “好吧，事实总是事实，自己犯了错误也不能光怕人家议论，看我以后的行动吧！”他决定振作起来。
    从此以后，领导上布置给陈宏文的任务，他总是积极地去干。周围的一些干部对他的态度也不像他刚受处分时的样子了，大家仍然同往常一样地和他商量、研究工作。这一点使陈宏文得到了很大的安慰。但是，羞耻、惭愧总还是不能离开他。他除了工作以外，好像对别的事就都没有兴趣了。本来他是一个很喜欢多讲多说的人，现在他却变得沉闷孤独起来。
    当时，正是搞并社、升级紧张的时候，陈宏文原来领导的正大农业社，经领导研究后，决定和附近的光明社合并，成立高级社。在研究建社筹备委员会人选时，支部分析了陈宏文除了缺点外，对合作社领导得还不错，也有一套办法，就建议选举他作建社筹备委员会委员。
    爬起来
    集体的信任，使陈宏文很感动，改正自己错误的决心更强了。在处理春花入社问题时，他挨户上社员家里去访问，说服动员，解除社员对春花入社的各种思想顾虑。但是在进行这一工作时，也碰到了一些钉子。个别社员为了个人打算，不顾社的利益，硬是不肯把春花入社。群众对这种行为都很不满意，他却不敢大胆地提出来，让大家分析、讨论，进行适当的批判。支部领导发现这一情况后，又帮助他、鼓励他大胆地工作，并且和他研究了对这些落后社员进行教育的办法。经过教育以后，个别社员的思想通了，春花入社的问题顺利地解决了。
    但是，在讨论手拉车入社的问题时，陈宏文又发现有些社员对手拉车入社有顾虑，便自己首先带头，把已经卖了的手拉车重新买回来入了社。在陈宏文的带头下，全社十八部手拉车全部入了社。领导上发现了这一事实，就及时地表扬了他。这些事实使陈宏文在社员中的威信增高了，在并社工作结束之后大家选举他担任了高级社的副主任。
    社员们相信他，陈宏文就越发感到自己应该更好地为社工作。今年社里连续三次遭了台灾，他一连数夜不睡，领导社员和狂风大水作斗争。有一天社主任朱官武突然病倒了，他和社里干部连夜把他送到医院里，自己就挑起了领导全社的担子。深夜，风大雨急，夜黑得伸手不见五指，陈宏文带着社干部摸着黑，挨户到社员家里去检查房屋情况。在发现全社有二十七户社员房屋被大风刮坍以后，他就和大家一起想办法一户一户地帮助进行了安置。群众对陈宏文这种关心社员疾苦的行动很感动。
    社里的生产救灾工作，在他和其他干部们的领导下，获得了全镇第一。
    今年9月份，镇里开展总结评比，陈宏文被评为镇一等优秀干部。
    “陈宏文转变了！”大家都这样说，领导上也看得很清楚。支部认为他已经具备了撤销处分的条件，9月16日，经过支部党员大会的讨论，作出了提前撤销陈宏文留党察看处分的决定。当陈宏文接到了县监察委员会正式批准决定的通知后，真感动得说不出话来。他说：
  “像我这样一个犯了严重错误的人，要不是党和同志们以治病救人的态度来帮助我、督促我改正错误，不知道会错到那条路上去了！”
