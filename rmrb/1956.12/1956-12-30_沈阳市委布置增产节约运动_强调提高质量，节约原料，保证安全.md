    Shenyang Municipal Party Committee Deploys Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    Emphasizing Improving Quality, Conserving Raw Materials, and Ensuring Safety
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shenyang) The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently deployed a comprehensive increase production and practice economy campaign for the first quarter of next year at an enlarged meeting of the Municipal Party Committee and a city-wide cadre conference.
    The meeting required that this increase production and practice economy campaign be carried out comprehensively, regardless of whether it is factories, enterprises, organs, schools, or society. In terms of industrial production, the focus should be on improving product quality, increasing new varieties, conserving raw materials, and ensuring safety; in terms of basic construction, the focus should be on improving project quality, rationally reducing costs, and ensuring safety. In terms of methods, we must first summarize the experiences and lessons of past increase production and practice economy campaigns, especially in conjunction with this year's advanced producer movement, and prevent the leadership methods of shock tactics and fleeting campaigns. At the same time, we must also pay attention to promoting and maintaining the good experiences of this year's advanced producer movement in improving technology and product quality, and prevent the practice of starting a new set of things away from the original foundation. Attention should be paid to promoting the advanced experience of saving raw materials on the premise of ensuring quality; however, when using substitute materials or changing designs and processes, leaders must be calm and adopt and promote them only after scientific tests have confirmed that they are advanced experiences, to avoid the phenomenon of saving on one hand and causing greater losses and waste on the other. In the current compilation of the 1957 plan, the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy should be implemented, and the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy should be incorporated into the plan. Formulating a plan that is both active and fully reliable is the greatest saving. In addition, it is even more necessary to care about the lives of employees in carrying out increase production and practice economy, and to prevent the necessary and legitimate welfare undertakings of employees from being cut off under the cover of the slogan of increase production and practice economy, or to be indifferent to the legitimate welfare requirements of employees.

    沈阳市委布置增产节约运动
    强调提高质量，节约原料，保证安全
    本报沈阳电　中共沈阳市委最近在市委扩大会和全市干部大会上，布置了在明年第一季度全面开展增产节约工作。
    会议要求这次增产节约运动不分工厂、企业、机关、学校或社会上，都要全面地开展起来。在工业生产方面应以提高产品质量、增加新品种，节约原材料、保证安全为重点；基本建设以提高工程质量、合理降低造价，保证安全为重点。在做法上，首先要总结往年增产节约运动、特别是结合今年先进生产者运动的经验教训，防止突击和一阵风的领导方法。同时也必须注意发扬和保持今年先进生产者运动中有关提高技术和产品质量的好经验，防止离开原有基础重搞一套的做法。要注意推广在保证质量前提下节约原材料的先进经验；但在采用代用材料或改变设计和工艺时，领导人员一定要冷静，并经过科学试验证明确是先进经验时，才能采用推广，以避免一面节约，一面造成更大的损失浪费现象。在目前编制1957年计划中，应该贯彻增产节约精神，将增产节约任务纳入计划之内。制定一个积极又充分可靠的计划，就是最大的节约。此外，在开展增产节约中更需要关心职工生活，要防止在增产节约口号掩盖下，把职工必要的正当的福利事业砍掉，或对职工正当的福利要求漠不关心。（金）
