Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 26th: President Sukarno, in his capacity as Supreme Commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces, issued an order on the evening of December 25th to all personnel of the Indonesian Armed Forces via radio broadcast, calling on everyone to resolutely safeguard the nation's unity and sovereignty, maintain military discipline, and assist the government in overcoming the current "difficulties threatening the integrity of the nation and state."

Sukarno pointed out that Colonel Simbolon's act of declaring secession from the central government was a violation of the constitution and the military oath. Therefore, he had signed an order to temporarily suspend Simbolon from his position as commander of the First Military District. He hoped that Simbolon and the officers and soldiers of the First Military District would repent of their mistakes.

He emphasized that soldiers must abide by national laws and military discipline, and "be good soldiers." He said that work to improve the state and the armed forces was being and would be done, and he wanted the soldiers to fully trust the leadership of the state and the armed forces to handle these matters.

Sukarno said that the current severe test would be passed peacefully and successfully, as in the past. Sukarno said, "When we still stand on the ideological foundation of the state and the army, which was solemnly declared since 1945, the country established by sacrificing countless lives and property of the people cannot be shaken by anyone."

Sukarno finally ordered the soldiers to "wholeheartedly execute this order and continue to ensure the safety of the country and the nation."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 26th: The Indonesian government's Ministry of Information announced on December 25th an order from President Sukarno declaring martial law in the eastern province of Sumatra and the Tapanuli province (in central Sumatra), as well as the sea areas surrounding these two provinces.

The order also pointed out that Colonel Simbolon's declaration of martial law throughout the entire First Military District was illegal because it violated the constitution. The constitution stipulates that only the President has the right to declare martial law in the Republic of Indonesia or parts of its territory.

    苏加诺向武装部队发布命令
    号召坚决维护国家统一和军纪
    并宣布苏门答腊两州处于戒严状态
    新华社雅加达26日电　苏加诺总统25日晚以印度尼西亚武装部队最高统帅的名义，通过广播电台向印度尼西亚武装部队全体人员发布命令，号召大家坚决维护国家的统一和主权，维护军队的纪律，协助政府克服目前“正威胁着民族和国家完整的困难”。
    苏加诺指出，宣布脱离中央的西姆波朗上校的行动是违反宪法和军人誓词的，因此他已经签署了暂时免去西姆波朗第一军区司令的停职书。他希望西姆波朗和第一军区官兵对他们所犯的错误有所悔悟。
    他强调指出军人必须遵守国家法律和军队纪律，“做一个良好的军人”。他说，改善国家和武装部队状况的工作正在做和将要做，他要军人们完全信托国家和武装部队的领导去处理这些事。
    苏加诺说，目前的严重考验将能够像过去一样平安地和成功地渡过。苏加诺说：“当我们还站在1945年起就庄严宣布的国家和军队的思想基础上的时候，牺牲了人民无数生命和财产而建立起来的国家是不能被任何人所动摇的。”
    苏加诺最后命令军人们“全心全意地执行这个命令，继续保障国家和民族的安全”。
    新华社雅加达26日电　印度尼西亚政府情报部在25日公布了苏加诺总统的一项命令，宣布苏门答腊的东部州和打板奴里州（在中苏门答腊）以及环绕这两个州的海面处于戒严状态。
    命令同时指出，西姆波朗上校宣布第一军区全区处在戒严状态的做法是非法的，因为这是违反宪法的。宪法规定只有总统有权宣布印度尼西亚共和国或它的部分领土处在戒严状态。
