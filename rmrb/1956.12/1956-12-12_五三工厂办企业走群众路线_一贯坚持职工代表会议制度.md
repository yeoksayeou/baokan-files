    Five Three Factory Runs Enterprises by Following the Mass Line
    Consistently Adhering to the System of Worker Representative Conferences
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Shenyang, 11th) The Five Three Factory has consistently adhered to the system of worker representative conferences for seven years, from 1950 to the present.
    This system has promoted democracy and played a significant role in absorbing workers and masses to participate in enterprise management and supervise leadership work. For example, at a worker representative conference held in June this year, workers, based on the serious situation that the factory had failed to meet the state quality targets for three consecutive months, put forward more than three hundred criticisms and suggestions, helping the factory leadership to clarify the reasons for the low quality. The leadership originally believed that the main reasons for the poor quality were the addition of new products, high technical requirements, and many new workers. However, worker representatives used facts in the discussion to show that the more important reasons for the low quality were the failure to do a good job in machine maintenance and the low precision of the machines. Everyone criticized the process section and the power section for dereliction of duty in machine design and maintenance. The representatives suggested carrying out a civilized production campaign throughout the factory and establishing a system of wiping the machines once every week for thirty minutes. After the meeting, the workers immediately launched a quality competition and strengthened machine maintenance work. The factory quickly improved product quality and completed the state quality target plan. For example, after workers criticized the leadership at the representative conference for the complicated procedures and long delays in handling rationalization proposals, the leadership quickly implemented a three-level approval system at the factory, workshop, and work section levels. The handling of each rationalization proposal was shortened from at least one month to five days. This also stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for making rationalization proposals.
    In 1955, the calculation of piecework wage unit prices was unreasonable, which reduced the workers' income, thus affecting the workers' production enthusiasm. After the worker representative conference reflected this problem, the administrative leadership immediately solved it. The workers were generally satisfied, and their production enthusiasm was improved. The production volume per person increased by an average of 15%, and the wage income also increased by 8.5%.
    For a period in the first half of this year, the cost of food was high. The workers did not eat well and had many opinions. Before the worker representative conference, on the one hand, the workers organized more than 30 canteen supervisors elected by the workshops to collect opinions separately; on the other hand, they organized a special inspection team to inspect the canteen's accounts. As a result, they found that the root cause of the high food cost and the decline in quality was that the administration shelved the worker welfare funds and mistakenly included various operating costs, water and electricity costs, and canteen staff bonuses in the food cost. The worker representatives put forward more than fifty criticisms and suggestions at the meeting in response to this situation. The head of the administrative welfare section made a self-criticism and took effective measures after the meeting to improve the food.
    The Five Three Factory holds a worker representative conference every quarter. Before each meeting, workers democratically elect representatives to attend the meeting and submit proposals to the representatives based on the central topic of the meeting. Each meeting lasts about seven or eight hours, generally after work, and continues for three or four evenings without affecting production. In addition to the factory director's brief work report, the main focus is on carrying out criticism from the bottom up. The proposals, suggestions, and criticisms raised at the meeting are summarized by the administration and the trade union and notified to the relevant departments, which are given a time limit of three days to reply or propose solutions. Then, each representative conveys the information to the workers, and the workers supervise the implementation.
    Because their opinions can be reflected and realized through the representative conference, the workers of the Five Three Factory have greatly strengthened their sense of ownership and are actively striving to complete and over fulfill the state plan. (Liaoning Daily Editorial Department)

### 五三工厂办企业走群众路线  一贯坚持职工代表会议制度

    五三工厂办企业走群众路线
    一贯坚持职工代表会议制度
    本报沈阳11日电　五三工厂从1950年到现在，七年来一直坚持执行职工代表会议的制度。
    这种制度发扬了民主，在吸收职工群众参加企业管理和监督领导工作方面起了显著的作用。例如在今年6月份召开的一次职工代表会议上，职工们根据全厂连续三个月没有完成国家质量指标计划的严重情况，提出了三百多项批评和建议，帮助工厂领导方面弄清了质量低的原因。领导方面原来认为质量不高的主要原因是增加了新产品、技术要求高和新工人多。可是，职工代表在讨论中用事实说明，形成质量不高的更主要的原因是没有作好机器维护工作和机器的精密度不高。大家批评了工艺科和动力科在机器设计和维护工作上有失职现象。代表们建议在全厂开展文明生产运动，建立每周用三十分钟的时间擦机器一次的制度。会后，职工们立即开展质量竞赛和加强维护机器工作。全厂很快就提高了产品质量，完成了国家质量指标计划。又如职工在代表会议上批评了领导方面处理合理化建议手续复杂、时间拖得很长以后，领导方面很快就实行厂、车间、工段三级的审批制度。每件合理化建议的处理，由原来最少需要一个月缩短到五天。这也就激发了职工们提合理化建议的热情。
    1955年计件工资的单价计算不合理，降低了工人的收入，因而影响工人的生产情绪。职工代表会议把这一问题反映出来之后，行政领导方面立即加以解决，工人普遍感到满意，生产热情提高，每人的生产量平均提高15％，工资收入也增加了8.5％。
    今年上半年有一个时期伙食成本高。职工吃的不好，意见很大。职工代表在会议之前，一面组织各车间职工选出三十多名食堂监督员，分头收集意见；一面组织专门检查小组去食堂检查伙食账目。结果，他们发现伙食成本高和质量下降的根本原因，是行政搁置职工福利费不用，而错误地将食堂各种运转费、水电费和食堂工作人员奖励费等，都算在伙食成本里面。职工代表们在会议上针对这一情况提出了五十多件批评和建议。行政福利科科长作了检讨，并在会后采取了有效措施，把伙食办好了。
    五三工厂每个季度召开一次职工代表会议。每次会议之前，由职工民主选举出席会议的代表，并根据会议的中心议题，提出提案交给代表。每次会议约开七、八个小时，一般都在下班后进行，连续开三、四个晚上，不影响生产。会上，除了厂长作简短的工作报告外，主要是开展自下而上的批评。会上提出的提案、建议和批评，会后由行政和工会共同归纳通知有关部门，限期三天给予答复或提出解决办法，然后由各代表向职工传达，由职工监督实现。
    五三工厂的职工由于自己的意见能通过代表会议得到反映和实现，大大加强了主人翁的感觉，正在积极为完成和超额完成国家计划而努力。　（辽宁日报编辑部）
