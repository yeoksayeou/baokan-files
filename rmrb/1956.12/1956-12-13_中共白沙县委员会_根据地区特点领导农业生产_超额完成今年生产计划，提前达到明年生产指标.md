Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 9th: The CCP Baisha County Committee in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, by specifically leading agricultural production based on ethnic and regional characteristics, enabled the entire county to surpass this year's production plan and achieve the production targets for 1957 ahead of schedule. The average per capita rice harvest this year was over 820 jin. All 72 advanced agricultural cooperatives in the county increased production and income, with 45 of them seeing their total income increase by 40% to over 100% compared to last year. Currently, the agricultural cooperatives are conducting preliminary distribution, and it is estimated that approximately 85% of the cooperative members in the county will increase their income compared to last year.

Baisha County is a Li ethnic group settlement area in the Wuzhi Mountain region. In the past, farmland here rarely received fertilizer or weeding, and some areas even used cattle to tread the fields. This year, under the favorable conditions of basically realizing agricultural cooperation, the CCP County Committee organized a production increase movement centered on technological reform.

The CCP County Committee first noted the characteristic that the Li people particularly trust cadres from their own ethnic group and mobilized ethnic minority cadres throughout the county and respected figures among the farmers to participate in technological reform work. Before the spring plowing and summer planting seasons, the CCP County Committee assisted relevant government departments in training and cultivating more than 2,500 Li technicians and selected Baisha Township, the hometown of Fu Guisen, the Li County Head of Baisha County, as the key township for technological reform in the county. When Fu Guisen returned to his hometown to guide the spring plowing technological reform work, the masses' enthusiasm was particularly high, and significant achievements were quickly made. At this time, the CCP County Committee organized representatives from agricultural cooperatives across the county to visit and observe. After the Li farmers visited, they dispelled their ideological concerns. They said, "The County Head's hometown has already done it, we cannot fall behind." In this way, through the exemplary demonstration method of the county, districts, and townships, the county's technological reform movement flourished. More than 10,000 mu of paddy fields that were once trampled by herds of water buffaloes have now adopted iron plow cultivation, generally achieving two plows and two harrows, as well as weeding. 70% of the county's paddy fields have implemented close planting, with more than 1,000 jin of fertilizer applied per mu per crop. Seed selection has been universally implemented in late rice fields. The agricultural cooperatives have also built more than 1,000 small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, enabling large areas of land to be irrigated.

In order to adapt to the actual situation of inconvenient transportation in the local mountainous areas and the low educational level of grassroots cadres and the masses, the CCP Baisha County Committee does not easily hold county-wide cadre meetings and issues very few official documents. The vast majority of county committee members are often in the countryside guiding work. When there are new instructions from higher levels, the County Committee holds meetings, and after the meetings, the secretaries and members immediately climb over mountains and ridges, heading to the townships or villages to personally convey the instructions to the cadres and the masses, and discuss implementation together.

This leadership method of going deep into the masses enables work to progress quickly and allows for the timely discovery of shortcomings and their correction. For example, Baisha County once experienced a deviation of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting sideline occupations this year, but it was quickly overcome. In the second half of the year, the county's sideline production income was approximately 230,000 yuan, increasing the income of each farmer household by an average of more than 20 yuan.

### 中共白沙县委员会  根据地区特点领导农业生产  超额完成今年生产计划，提前达到明年生产指标

    根据地区特点领导农业生产
    超额完成今年生产计划，提前达到明年生产指标
    新华社广州9日电　海南黎族苗族自治州白沙县中共县委会根据民族特点和地区特点具体地领导农业生产，使全县超额完成今年生产计划，并且达到了1957年的生产指标。平均每人今年收获的稻谷有八百二十多斤。这个县的七十二个高级农业社个个增产增收，其中有四十五个社的总收入比去年增加40％到一倍多。现在，农业社正在进行预分，估计全县约有85％的社员比去年增加收入。
    白沙县是五指山区的黎族人民聚居区。这里的农田过去很少施肥和中耕除草，部分地区还用牛踏田。今年，中共县委在基本上实现农业合作化的有利条件下，组织了一个以技术改革为中心的增产运动。
    中共县委首先注意到黎族人民特别信赖本民族干部的特点，便动员了全县民族干部及农民中有威信的人物参加技术改革工作。在春耕和夏种前夕，中共县委帮助政府有关部门训练和培养了二千五百多名黎族技术员，并选择了白沙县黎族县长符桂森的家乡——白沙乡，作为县的技术改革重点乡。当符桂森回本乡指导春耕技术改革的工作时，群众情绪特别高，很快作出了显著成绩。这时，中共县委便组织全县各地农业社的代表前往参观。黎族农民参观以后，打消了思想顾虑。他们说，县长家乡都做了，我们可不能落后。就这样通过县、区和乡的典型示范的办法，全县的技术改革运动蓬勃开展起来。过去一向用成群的水牛踩踏的一万多亩水田，今年已采用铁犁耕作，一般并作到了二犁二耙、中耕除草。全县70％的水田推行了密植，每亩田一造施肥一千多斤。晚稻田普遍实行选种。各农业社还修建了一千多处中小型水利，使大片田地得到灌溉。
    中共白沙县委为了适应当地山区交通不便、基层干部和群众文化水平不高的实际情况，平常不轻易举行全县性的干部会议，公文也很少。绝大部分县委委员经常都在农村指导工作。当上级有新的指示时，县委召开会议，会后书记和委员又马上爬山越岭分头到乡或村去，亲自向干部和群众传达，并且和大家一起讨论执行。
    这样深入群众的领导方法，使工作进展很快，并能及时发现一些缺点，加以纠正。如今年白沙县曾一度发生过重农业轻副业的偏向，但是很快就克服了。下半年，全县副业生产收入约二十三万多元，平均每户农民增加了二十多元的收入。
