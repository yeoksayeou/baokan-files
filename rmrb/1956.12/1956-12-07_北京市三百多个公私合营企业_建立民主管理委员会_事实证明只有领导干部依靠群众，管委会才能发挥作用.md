Xinhua News Agency, December 6th – Democratic management committees in many joint state-private enterprises in Beijing have played a significant role in running the enterprises well and uniting and educating private sector personnel.

Currently, over 300 joint state-private factories and stores in the city have established democratic management committees. Participants in the democratic management committees include employee representatives, administrative, Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League leaders, as well as private sector personnel, all elected. The democratic management committees regularly discuss major issues in enterprise production and management, reflect the opinions and demands of the workers, and take effective measures to help enterprise leaders overcome bureaucracy and improve enterprise management. Workers at the Oriental Screw Factory proposed establishing a “designated person, designated vehicle” responsibility system. The administrative leadership did not study it carefully, deeming it too difficult and rejecting it. After the democratic management committee studied it and affirmed its value, it supported the workers and made a resolution to adopt the suggestion. After the suggestion was implemented, the factory's monthly output immediately increased by nearly 5%, and the defect rate dropped from 3.52% to 0.86%. Li Fu'en, the private sector manager of the Tongshenghe Shoe and Hat Store, was not responsible in his work and did not address instances of a few employees not adhering to labor discipline. After the democratic management committee discovered this, it proactively discussed the issue, criticized the employees who did not abide by labor discipline, and educated Li Fu'en to be responsible to the country and take charge of his work. Li Fu'en was deeply moved. When a factory received a batch of urgent orders from the state, the private sector factory director tried to take advantage of the situation by substituting inferior materials for quality materials. Workers reported this situation, and the democratic management committee promptly discussed it, criticizing the private sector personnel's erroneous practices, which resulted in the use of quality materials.

According to responsible persons from relevant departments in Beijing, the key to making democratic management committees effective lies in the democratic work style of enterprise leaders in relying on the masses.

Currently, in some joint state-private enterprises in Beijing, due to the poor democratic work style of the leading cadres, they believe that the democratic management committee is dispensable or treat it as a mechanism for passing their own opinions. As a result, the democratic management committees in these enterprises are reduced to formalities and cannot play their due role. After the establishment of the democratic management committee at the Great Wall Clock Factory, the production plans assigned by higher authorities were sometimes conveyed by the administrative leadership to the workshops without discussion by the democratic management committee; sometimes, when discussions were held, and committee members raised opposing views, the leading cadres would criticize the masses for having ideological problems, resulting in the loss of confidence in the democratic management committee among the workers.

　　北京市三百多个公私合营企业
　　建立民主管理委员会
　　事实证明只有领导干部依靠群众，管委会才能发挥作用
    新华社6日讯　北京市许多公私合营企业中的民主管理委员会在办好企业、团结教育私方人员方面起了很大作用。
    全市目前已有三百多个公私合营工厂和商店建立了民主管理委员会。参加民主管理委员会的除企业的职工代表和行政、党、工会、青年团负责人以外，还有私方人员；他们都是由选举产生的。民主管理委员会定期讨论企业生产和经营管理上的重大问题，反映职工群众的意见和要求，并且作出有效措施，帮助企业领导上克服官僚主义，改善企业的管理。东方螺丝工厂工人提出建立“专人专车”责任制的建议，行政领导上没有很好研究，就认为困难很多，不予采纳。民主管理委员会加以研究，肯定它的价值后，就支持工人，作出了采纳建议的决议。建议实施后，这个工厂月产量立即提高了近5％，次品率由3.52％降低为0.86％。同升和鞋帽店私方经理李富恩，工作中不敢负责，见到少数店员不遵守劳动纪律的现象也不过问。民主管理委员会发现后，主动地讨论了这个问题，批评了不遵守劳动纪律的店员，并且教育李富恩应对国家负责，把工作担当起来。李富恩深受感动。有一个工厂接到国家一批紧急订货，私方厂长想混水摸鱼，以次料顶好料。工人反映了这个情况，民主管理委员会及时进行了讨论，批评了私方人员的错误作法，结果用了好料。
    据北京市有关部门负责人谈，要使民主管理委员会发挥作用，关键在于企业领导干部依靠群众的民主作风。
    目前北京市有些公私合营企业由于领导干部民主作风差，认为民主管理委员会可有可无，或者把它作为通过自己意见的机构，因而这些企业的民主管理委员会流于形式，不能发挥应有的作用。长城造钟厂的民主管理委员会成立后，上级布置的生产计划，行政领导上有时不经民主管理委员会讨论，就下达到车间；有时讨论了，但委员们提出相反意见时，领导干部就批评群众思想有问题，结果职工群众对民主管理委员会失去信心。
