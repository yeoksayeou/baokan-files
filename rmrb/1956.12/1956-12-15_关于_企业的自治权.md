    On "Autonomy of Enterprises"
  　Kong Sang
    Since Comrade Liu Shaoqi proposed granting enterprises "appropriate autonomy" in the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the demand for "autonomy" has increased. During this period, the People's Daily has received many letters and articles from readers pointing out that there are many inappropriate aspects of the current economic management system that hinder the initiative and flexibility of enterprises. Some readers also criticized the newspaper for its one-sidedness in past propaganda, often only blaming enterprises for many shortcomings, rather than also pointing out the problems in the leading organs and leadership system. For example, only criticizing the practice of rushing to spend money at the end of the year, without considering whether the system of turning over all year-end surpluses is also less than reasonable; only criticizing enterprises for hoarding materials, keeping small warehouses, and being generous with budgets, while ignoring that the relevant departments often fail to supply materials to enterprises on time, with assured quality, and in sufficient quantity; only criticizing enterprises for uneven production, without pointing out that the higher authorities issue plans too late and change them too often; only criticizing some enterprises for not paying attention to the trial production of new products, while failing to understand that the regulations stipulated by higher authorities do not include funding for new product trial production, and that the trial production of new products affects the reduction of the cost of old products.

    It should be said that these opinions of the readers are well-founded, and some economic management systems are worthy of study and improvement. However, in some letters, unhealthy sentiments are also revealed. It seems that since the leading organs have these shortcomings, it is "only natural" for the lower levels not to act in accordance with the regulations. You blame me for rushing to spend money at the end of the year, but who told you to stipulate that the surplus must be turned over? You blame me for storing extra materials, but who told you that you would not guarantee the supply? In other words, since the higher authorities are controlling too much and too rigidly in some matters, enterprises might as well "govern themselves."

    This kind of sentiment and practice is also incorrect. There is no doubt that the shortcomings in the national economic management system should be earnestly improved. However, this does not mean that regulations can be dispensed with, or that regulations I deem unreasonable can be ignored. It must be firmly remembered that the implementation of planned economy and planned management is the most basic and important aspect of our country. Giving enterprises appropriate autonomy is proposed under this major premise in order to encourage the initiative of enterprises and better realize the country's economic plan. Appropriate decentralization must not harm necessary centralization. Neglecting either aspect will only have a negative impact on the work.

    关于“企业的自治权”
  　孔桑
    自从刘少奇同志在中共第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中提出要给企业以“适当的自治权利”以后，要求“自治权”的呼声就多了起来。人民日报在这一时期中就接到不少读者的来信来稿，提出现行的经济管理制度中有许多不妥当的地方，妨碍了企业的主动性和机动性。有的读者并且批评报纸过去在宣传上有片面性，对许多缺点，往往只指责企业，而不是同时也指出领导机关和领导制度中的毛病。例如，只批评下面年终突击花钱，而不考虑年终结余一律上缴的制度是否也有不尽合理之处；只批评企业打埋伏，留小仓库，宽打窄用，而忽视了有关的主管部门常常不能按时按质按量地给企业供应材料；只批评企业生产不均衡，却没有指出上级下达计划过迟和变动太多；只批评某些企业不重视新产品试制工作，却不了解上级规定的制度中，没有新产品试制费用，试制了新产品就影响老产品成本的降低。
    应当说，读者的这些意见都是有根据的，一些经济管理制度也是值得研究和改进的。但是，在有一些来信当中，也流露了不怎么健康的情绪。好像既然领导机关有这些缺点，下面不按制度办事就是“理所当然”。怪我年终突击花钱，谁叫你规定结余一定要上缴？怪我多存了材料，谁叫你不保证供应？换句话说，上面既然有些事情管得太多太死，企业就无妨自行“自治”起来。
    这种情绪和做法也是不正确的。毫无疑问，国家经济管理制度中的缺点应当认真地加以改进。但是，这决不等于说可以不要制度，或者凡是我认为不合理的制度就可以不执行。应当牢牢记住，实行计划经济、计划管理，这是我们国家最基本最主要的方面，给企业适当的自治权利，是在这个大前提下提出来的，是为了鼓励企业的积极性，更好地实现国家的经济计划。适当的分散决不能损害必要的集中，偏废任何一方面，都只能对工作造成不良的影响。
