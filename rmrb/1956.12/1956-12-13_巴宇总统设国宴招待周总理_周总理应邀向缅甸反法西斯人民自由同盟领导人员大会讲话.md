Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 12th: Burmese Federal President Ba U hosted a state banquet at the Presidential Residence on the evening of the 11th to entertain Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long.

President Ba U delivered a welcoming speech, saying that Premier Zhou Enlai is a sincere friend of the Burmese people and one of the initiators of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said, "At a time when the world is in a state of fear, suspicion, and tension, we can prove not only with slogans but also with examples that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are the path to world peace." He added that, in the spirit of friendship and tolerance, there are no problems in the world that cannot be solved.

Premier Zhou Enlai said in his reply that the cordial conversations he had with old friends during this visit, as well as other mutual visits by Burmese and Chinese government leaders, have strengthened the belief that friendship and trust can be established among nations on the basis of the Five Principles, and that unresolved issues between countries can be gradually resolved reasonably.

Premier Zhou Enlai expressed agreement with President Ba U's view on setting an example of coexistence, saying that China will unswervingly adhere to the spirit of the Five Principles, strive to strengthen friendship and solidarity with the people of Burma and other Asian and African countries, as well as the people of the world, to oppose colonialism, safeguard independence and sovereignty, and defend world peace.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Zhongming and his wife, as well as personnel accompanying Premier Zhou Enlai on the visit, also attended the banquet hosted by the Burmese President.

The party was held on the brightly lit lawn of the Presidential Residence. Colorful electric lights were hung around the buildings, on poles, and in the branches of trees. Burmese singers sang "Sino-Burmese Friendship Song" and "Singing of Chairman Mao" in Burmese and Chinese. Students and famous dancers performed dance programs.

During the break, President Ba U, Prime Minister U Ba Swe, and Premier Zhou Enlai left their seats and walked around the tables, shaking hands with Burmese government officials and foreign diplomats.

The Chinese government leaders, accompanied by Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu and Vice Chairman U Ba Swe, entered the City Hall. At the entrance, members of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Executive Committee were waiting to greet them, and Burmese women in gorgeous costumes were scattering flower petals and rice on the Chinese guests. Inside the hall, members of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League stood up and applauded to welcome them. The Burmese national anthem and the Chinese national anthem were played in the meeting hall.
