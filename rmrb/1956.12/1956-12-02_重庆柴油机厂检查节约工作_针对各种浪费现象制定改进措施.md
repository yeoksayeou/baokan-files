Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 1st: The Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant, which has done a relatively good job in savings work, inspected its fourth-quarter savings plan again in late November and added practical and feasible measures to eliminate waste throughout the plant.

The Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant's foundry workshop had been afraid of increasing defective products and had not promoted the advanced experience of using iron filings and steel shavings for a long time. The new measures require the immediate use of iron filings and steel shavings piled up in the plant's open spaces to replace old scrap steel and scrap iron as raw materials for castings other than cylinder liners. Now, this plant is sending people to the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant to learn this advanced experience and is actively installing the equipment needed to utilize iron filings and steel shavings within the plant.

In the past, the foundry workshop wasted a lot of thin iron plates when manufacturing ductile iron. Now, new measures have also been studied to save thin iron plates.

Since the implementation of the fourth-quarter savings plan in October, the supply and construction section and production workshops of the Chongqing Diesel Engine Plant have also jointly cleaned up the plant's warehouses, defective product warehouses, and scrap yards, thereby finding forty-four types of materials that were originally in very short supply.

In addition, the metalworking and stamping workshops have also formulated specific and effective improvement measures to address the current waste phenomena.

　　重庆柴油机厂检查节约工作
　  针对各种浪费现象制定改进措施
    新华社重庆1日电　节约工作做得较好的重庆柴油机厂，在11月下旬又检查了第四季度节约计划，增加了切实可行的措施，以杜绝全厂的浪费现象。
    重庆柴油机厂的铸工车间，以往怕废品增加，长时期来没有推广利用铁屑和钢屑的先进经验。新措施要求立刻利用堆满全厂空地的铁屑和钢屑，代替旧废钢和废铁，充作套缸以外的铸件原料。现在这个厂一面派人到重庆机床厂去学习这一先进经验，一面积极在厂内安装利用铁屑和钢屑所需要的设备。
    以往铸工车间制造球墨铸铁的时候，浪费了很多薄铁板，现在也研究出新措施，节约薄铁板。
    从10月份执行第四季度节约计划以来，重庆柴油机厂的供建科和生产车间，还共同清理了全厂的仓库、废品库和废料库，从而找到了四十四种原来供应很困难的材料。
    此外，金工和冲压等车间，也针对目前所存在的浪费现象，订出了具体有效的改进措施。
