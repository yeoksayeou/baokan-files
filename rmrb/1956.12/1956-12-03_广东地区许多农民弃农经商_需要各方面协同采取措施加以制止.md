Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 2nd (Xinhua News Agency reporter Feng Ziping): Judging from the situation in Guangdong Province, many farmers are currently abandoning agriculture for business. This problem needs to be brought to the attention of all relevant parties, and joint measures should be taken to solve it.

According to a rough estimate from twelve small and medium-sized cities in Guangdong Province, in the two months or so since the opening of the free market under state leadership, the number of small merchants and peddlers has increased by more than 5,200, the vast majority of whom are farmers. In Nanxing District of Haikang County, there are 317 unlicensed vendors, more than double the number of original commercial households in the entire district.

The phenomenon of farmers abandoning agriculture for business primarily reflects a one-sided understanding or misunderstanding of the state-led free market by some cadres and farmers. Individual members of the CPC Lingao County Committee, at an enlarged cadre meeting, only publicly stated that farmers could engage in commercial activities, without clearly defining the boundaries and scope of farmers' trade. Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, the county's financial and economic organs issued more than 400 vendor permits to farmers in a very short period of time. Farmers in various places also thought that the government had now restored the free market of the past, and that "any kind of business can be done."

Reduced income for some agricultural cooperative members is an important reason why farmers abandon agriculture for business. In Maqiao Township, Yangjiang County, the late rice harvest this year was reduced by 20%, and the income of agricultural cooperatives and members decreased. In one cooperative, the daily wage per labor day was only 48 cents. Therefore, the situation of farmers engaging in business in this township is more serious than in other townships. Conversely, in the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Pingzhou District, Nanhai County, production is very good, and the daily wage per labor day is 1.30 yuan. Almost no members of this cooperative want to go out and do business.

Guangdong is a commercially developed area with many small and medium-sized towns, extensive transportation networks, and many cash crops, with things to sell all year round. Farmers have always had the habit of doing small business. In addition, the current distribution of commercial networks in various places cannot meet objective needs, which are all reasons why farmers easily engage in pure commercial activities.

At present, farmers engaging in business not only affects the state's market arrangements but has also seriously affected the consolidation and development of agricultural cooperatives. In the Fourth Production Team of the Gangyuan Township Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongshan County, because two team leaders and 43 members were once keen on doing business, the daily attendance rate dropped from about 100 people to about 10 people. Of the 250 mu of land cultivated by this team, more than 30 mu were overgrown with weeds and unattended. It was originally estimated that these fields could yield 105,000 jin of rice, but now it is estimated that they can only yield more than 51,000 jin, a reduction of half. The Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Zinan Township, Nanhai County, is a model cooperative. Seeing that some people were making money from business, six of the cooperative's nine management committee members went to engage in commercial activities, and 23 of the cooperative's 40 main laborers went into business, leaving the cooperative's agricultural production and fish ponds without leadership and management. Now is the season for winter planting and winter plowing, but there are still few people in the fields. Some members are ideologically confused and plan to withdraw from the cooperative.

At present, financial and economic departments in various parts of Guangdong have begun to criticize this laissez-faire tendency towards the state-led free market, strengthen market management, clarify the boundaries and scope of farmers' trade, and adjust the commercial networks of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives. However, other relevant parties, especially the leadership of agricultural cooperatives, have not yet cooperated and supported the commercial departments well to do this work; publicity work has also not kept up.

　　广东地区许多农民弃农经商
  　需要各方面协同采取措施加以制止
    新华社广州2日电　新华社记者冯子平报道：从广东地区看，目前有许多农民弃农从商，这个问题需要引起各有关方面注意，共同采取措施来加以解决。
    据广东地区十二个中小城市的粗略统计，自从国家领导下的自由市场开放以来两个多月中，小商小贩增加了五千二百多户，其中绝大多数是农民。海康县南兴区没有牌照的商贩有三百一十七户，比全区原有的商业户还要多一倍以上。
    农民弃农从商的这件事，首先反映了某些干部和农民对国家领导下的自由市场的片面了解或误解。中共临高县委的个别委员，在干部扩大会议上只是公开说，农民可以从事商业活动，没有把农民贸易的界限、范围划清楚。在这种思想指导下，这个县的财经机关在很短的时间内就发了四百多张摊贩证给农民。各地农民也以为政府现在又恢复过去的自由市场了，“什么生意都可以做了”。
    有些农业社社员收入减少，是农民弃农从商的重要原因。阳江县麻桥乡今年晚稻减产二成，农业社和社员收入减少，其中一个社的每个劳动日报酬只四角八分，因此这个乡农民从商的情况比其他乡严重。相反地，南海县平洲区红旗农业社，生产搞得很好，每个劳动日报酬一元三角，这个社的社员就几乎没有人想外出做生意。
    广东是一个商业很发达的地方，中小城镇多，交通四通八达，经济作物多，一年四季都有东西卖，农民向来有做小买卖的习惯。加上目前各地商业网分布状况还不能满足客观的需要，这些也都是农民容易从事纯商业活动的原因。
    目前农民从商不但影响了国家对市场的安排，而且已经严重地影响了农业社的巩固和发展。中山县港园乡农业社第四生产队，由于两个队长和四十三个社员曾一度热中于经商，每天的出勤人数从一百人左右减少到十人左右。这个队耕种的二百五十亩田，其中有三十多亩田长满杂草，无人管理。这些田原来估计可以收稻谷十万五千斤，现在估计只能收五万一千多斤，减产一半。南海县紫南乡明星农业社是一个模范社。由于看到一些人从商赚钱，社里九个管理委员中有六个人去搞商业活动，全社四十个主要劳动力中有二十三个去经商，弄得社里的农业生产和鱼塘无人领导和管理。现在正是冬种、冬耕的季节，但是田园里依然很少看到人影，有的社员思想混乱，打算退社。
    现在，广东各地财经部门已经开始批判这种对国家领导下的自由市场的放任自流倾向，加强市场管理，划清农民贸易的界限和范围，调整国营商业和供销合作社的商业网。但是其他各有关方面，特别是农业社的领导方面，还没有很好地和商业部门互相配合和支持，来做好这个工作；宣传工作也还没有跟上。
