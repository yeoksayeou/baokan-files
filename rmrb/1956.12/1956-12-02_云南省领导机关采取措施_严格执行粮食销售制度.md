(Our dispatch from Kunming) The leading organs of Yunnan Province are taking active measures to correct the uncontrolled phenomenon of grain sales, and adhere to the principle of guaranteeing necessary rationed supplies under the premise of the unified purchase and sale system.

Since the third quarter of this year, grain sales in Yunnan Province have increased abnormally, exceeding the plan by 11% and increasing by 48.2% compared with the same period last year. In some individual areas, soybeans that had been stored for several years were sold out in a matter of days; in some areas, flour supply was strained. The reason for this situation is mainly that the sales system was not well controlled. For example, the Chuxiong Special District arbitrarily printed a large number of rural pig feed coupons; in Yongping County, grain was purchased without grain coupons or proof, and agricultural cooperatives provided rosters, upon which grain departments sold grain. The county head of Kaiyuan County even announced: "No grain coupons or any proof are required for seeds, feed, or flour." In many areas, the supply was originally normal, but as soon as grain coupons were not required, there was an immediate shortage or stockout.

In response to this situation, the relevant departments of Yunnan Province have decided to take the following measures: (1) Require all localities to earnestly implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council on inspecting grain sales, conduct a thorough inspection of grain work, and control sales from now until March next year, supplying grain whenever there is a shortage. Resolutely implement the plan while guaranteeing reasonable needs. (2) Strictly implement the grain supply system, correct the practice of not collecting grain coupons and not including them in rationed supplies; the ordering of hog feed must be implemented in accordance with the instructions issued by the province. (3) In the future, seeds will generally be selected and retained by farmers themselves, and the agricultural departments will only promote and regulate the supply of fine varieties; the grain departments will only select some of the grain that can be used as seeds from commercial grain to reserve for supplying disaster areas or exchanging with farmers. (4) Control sales, and it is necessary to investigate and verify claims of grain shortages and handle them realistically.

    云南省领导机关采取措施
　　严格执行粮食销售制度
    本报昆明电　云南省领导机关正采取积极措施，纠正对粮食销售的不加控制现象，坚持在统购统销制度的前提下保证必须的定量供应。
    今年三季度开始后，云南省粮食销售不正常的增加，超过计划11％，比去年同时期增加了48.2％。个别地区，几年来存下的大豆，几天就销完；有些地区面粉供应紧张。出现这样情况的原因，主要是销售制度掌握不好。例如楚雄专区擅自大量印制农村猪料票；永平县购粮不用粮票，不用证明，农业社开出花名册，粮食部门即凭册卖粮。开远县县长还宣布：“籽种、饲料、面粉都不收粮票，不办任何证明。”许多地区，供应原是正常的，但一不要粮票，立即发生了紧张或脱销的现象。
    针对这一情况，云南省有关部门决定采取如下的措施：（1）要求各地切实执行中共中央和国务院关于检查粮食销售的指示，对粮食工作进行一次深入的检查，把从现在起到明年3月的销量控制起来，何时缺，何时供应。在保证合理需要的情况下坚决执行计划。（2）严格执行粮食供应制度，纠正不收粮票、不列入定量供应的做法；订购生猪饲料必须根据省下达的指示执行。（3）今后籽种原则上由农民自选自留，农业部门只作优良品种的推广和调剂；粮食部门只从商品粮食中选出可作籽种的粮食储备一部分，以供应受灾地区或与农民调换。（4）控制销售，对叫喊缺粮的必需查明，实事求是进行处理。
