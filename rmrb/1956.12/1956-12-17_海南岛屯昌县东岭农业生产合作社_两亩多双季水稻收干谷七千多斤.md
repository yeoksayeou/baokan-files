Hainan Island Tunchang County Dongling Agricultural Production Cooperative
	Over 7,000 Jin of Dried Grain Harvested from More Than Two Mu of Double-Season Rice
(Our newspaper's dispatch) The national record for per-unit-area yield of double-season rice continues to be broken; the Dongling Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Tunchang County, Hainan Island, now takes the lead. In the cooperative's 330-plus mu of high-yield fields, the highest-yielding 2.97 mu plot yielded a total of 7,024 jin of dried grain in two harvests, averaging 2,365 jin of dried grain per mu. Among the high-yield fields, 33.86 mu yielded an average of over 1,500 jin of dried grain per mu per year; of these, 11.6 mu yielded 2,037 jin of dried grain per mu per year; the remaining 290-plus mu of high-yield fields also achieved an average yield of 1,265 jin per mu. The cooperative's total of over 3,500 mu of double-season rice fields averaged 707 jin per mu. The cooperative's total rice production this year increased by 49% compared to last year. These yields were all confirmed by agricultural technology department cadres who were present on-site for the harvest and weighing.
	The cooperative is located in a mountainous area; after the establishment of the advanced cooperative this spring, the Party branch, based on the characteristics of the mountainous area, mobilized cooperative members to build 86 small-scale water conservancy projects, fully utilizing mountain springs to irrigate farmland, freeing the cooperative's cultivated land from the threat of drought. At the same time, they made full use of the abundant natural fertilizers in the mountainous area, applying 5,000 to 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu for each application in the high-yield fields, and over 3,700 jin per mu for each application in other fields. On the other hand, the cooperative implemented intensive cultivation, carrying out comprehensive technical reforms centered on close planting of small seedlings; among them, over 300 mu of high-yield fields also carried out single-plant close planting, organizing experienced farmers for specialized management.

    海南岛屯昌县东岭农业生产合作社
    两亩多双季水稻收干谷七千多斤
    本报讯　双季稻单位面积产量的全国最高纪录不断出现；海南岛屯昌县的东岭高级农业社又占首位。这个社的三百三十多亩丰产田中，最高的一丘二点九七亩田，两次共收干谷七千零二十四斤多，平均每亩收干谷二千三百六十五斤。丰产田中还有三十三点八六亩，平均每亩年产干谷一千五百斤以上；其中有十一点六亩田，每亩年产干谷二千零三十七斤；其余的二百九十多亩丰产田，每亩平均产量也达到一千二百六十五斤。全社三千五百多亩双季稻，平均每亩产量也有七百零七斤。全社今年稻谷总产量比去年增加了49％。这些产量都是由农业技术部门干部当场监收和过秤证实的。
    这个社地处山区；在今年春季高级社建成以后，党支部就根据山区特点，发动社员兴修了八十六宗小型水利，充分利用山泉灌溉农田，使全社耕地免除旱患威胁。同时，他们充分利用了山区丰富的自然肥料，丰产田每亩每次施肥五千至一万斤，其他田地每亩每次也施肥三千七百斤以上。另方面，全社实行了精耕细作，进行以小科密植为中心的全面技术改革；其中三百多亩丰产田还进行了单株密植，组织老农专门管理。　（新海南报社）
