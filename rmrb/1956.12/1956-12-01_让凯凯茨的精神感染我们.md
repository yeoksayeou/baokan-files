　　Let the Spirit of Kekec Infect Us
　　Zǐ Gāng

　　After watching the Yugoslav film "Kekec's Adventures," a friend and I habitually discussed its central theme. We enthusiastically explored: What does the menacing figure of Bedanc symbolize? Why does he believe that the hooting of an owl heralds death? Why is it that only Kekec, a young boy, is unafraid of him and ultimately subdues him?

　　However, these self-imposed anxieties were ultimately overcome by the young hero's optimism and endearing image. We both felt relaxed and cheerful after watching it, as if we had stumbled into a warm house after being exhausted by a blizzard. Kekec's opposition to gloom, his singing aloud in the fields, his observation and understanding of nature and biological phenomena with a curious gaze and an open mind, seemed to influence us, and the effect lingered for a long time.

　　We finally offered a self-deprecating explanation:

　　It's a mythological adventure film! Bedanc may be the incarnation of a mountain god, or perhaps a figure from Yugoslav folklore. It's perfectly acceptable to say he symbolizes some sort of antagonist, just as children are accustomed to identifying good and bad people, but don't necessarily investigate whether they are tyrants or landlords.

　　As for Bedanc's fear of owls, let's just say it's a Western custom, and people often have some strange quirks, liking this or disliking that.

　　And Kekec's ability to defeat Bedanc is just as Kosobrin said: wisdom can enable a small mouse to defeat an elephant. Kekec is the embodiment of alertness, wisdom, and courage in the hearts of the Yugoslav people, and they love him. If a child who has just learned to listen to stories sits on his mother's lap and hears the story of Kekec conquering Bedanc and rescuing Kosobrin and Mojca, it will certainly inject some beneficial factors into the child's character development and add some beautiful imagination to his small heart.

　　Through the images of children and adults in the film, we have indeed seen the living traditions and customs of the Yugoslav people, as well as the things that bind their thoughts and feelings at a deep level: the pursuit of beautiful and good things. How interesting is Kosobrin's herb-collecting life, as he wants to give health to the world! How happy is Mojca to receive his pity, as she is lacking a "mother's soul" to heal her sorrow! Kekec's parents' ordinary dreams as ordinary people are also relatable and understandable; they are diligent in their labor, celebrate the harvest, and are willing to eat something good on their birthdays. Even little Brincelj's brotherly affection for his brother and Rozle's mischief are just like the way our own children often give us joy in their words and actions.

　　"Kekec's Adventures," adapted from the novel by Josip Vandot, has won international awards. Along with other films, it is the culmination of the Yugoslav film industry's outstanding labor over the past decade. Yugoslav film artists have made considerable efforts to lay the foundation for their film industry.

　　Facts have proven that this foundation is well-laid, because Yugoslav film artists have realized that culture encompasses all good aspects, and film is one of them; and culture is like a delicate sapling, requiring great care and time to nurture it.

　　We have seen that the means chosen by Yugoslav filmmakers to achieve the aims of film art are not simple or crude. While paying attention to making film a department of socialist culture, they have not forgotten that film must also be entertaining. It is not just a serious form of education.

　　Therefore, we were able to walk out of the theater feeling relaxed and cheerful after watching "Kekec's Adventures," and its impact is both indirect and long-lasting. Who would definitively say: I don't need that little fellow Kekec's optimism and drive?

　　让凯凯茨的精神感染我们
　　子冈
    看完了南斯拉夫影片“小勇士历险记”以后，同一个朋友习惯地谈起它的主题思想。我们热心研究着：那个凶神一样的斐纳茨象征什么？他为什么会相信猫头鹰一叫就要死人的呢？为什么只有凯凯茨一个小毛孩子不怕他，而且终于把他降伏了？
    但是这些自扰的种种想法终于被小勇士的乐观精神和可爱形象抵制过去了，我们都觉得看过后十分轻松愉快，就好像在大风雪中跑累了、踏进了温暖的屋子一样；而凯凯茨的反对愁眉苦脸，在田野间纵声歌唱、用好奇的目光和开朗的心胸观察体会大自然和生物现象的种种劲头儿，也仿佛影响了我们，好久好久不能消褪。
    我们终于自嘲地作着解答：
    这是神话故事片呀！斐纳茨也许是山神的化身，也许是南斯拉夫的民间传说中的人物。说他是象征什么反派人物都可以，正如同小孩子们习惯地辨认好人坏人，但也不见得追问那是暴君或是地主一样。
    至于斐纳茨怕猫头鹰，就算它是一种西方的习俗吧，而且人们往往是会有一些古怪的癖好，喜欢这或厌恶那的。
    而凯凯茨之能够战胜斐纳茨，这正如阔索勃林所说：智慧能够使一只小老鼠战胜大象。凯凯茨是南斯拉夫人民心中的机警、智慧、勇敢的化身，人们爱他。假如一个刚学会听故事的孩子，坐在母亲膝上，听一遍凯凯茨征服斐纳茨，救出阔索勃林和毛叶莎的故事，这一定也可以在孩子性格的成长上注入有益的一些什么因素，增加小小心灵中一些美好的想像。
    通过片中儿童和成人的形象，我们确已看到了南斯拉夫人民的生活传统和习俗，以及维系着他们的思想感情深处的东西：追求美好善良的事物。阔索勃林的采药生活多么有趣，他想把健康给予世人；毛叶莎得到了他的怜爱多么幸福，她正缺少医治悲伤的“母亲的灵魂”呢！凯凯茨的爸爸妈妈作为普通人的平凡梦想也是亲切易解的；他们勤于劳动，庆贺丰收；愿意在过生日的时候吃些好的。就是小辛卡对哥哥的手足之情以及罗许尔的调皮捣蛋，也就像咱们自己的孩子往往在言语行动里给了我们欢乐一样。
    这个根据万道托小说改编的“小勇士历险记”在国际间得过奖。它和其它若干影片一道，是十多年来南斯拉夫电影界杰出的劳动结晶。南斯拉夫电影艺术工作者作了相当艰苦的努力，为他们的电影事业打下了基础。
    事实证明，这个基础打得很好，因为南斯拉夫的电影艺术工作者们已经认识到：文化包括着美好的各个方面，电影是其中之一；而文化就像一棵娇嫩的小树，需要十分细心、需要时间来护理它。
    我们已经看到，南斯拉夫电影工作者们对待达到电影艺术目的所择的手段并不简单或粗暴，他们在注意使电影成为社会主义文化的一个部门的同时，没有忘记电影必须也是娱乐性的。它不只是严肃的教导。
    也因此，我们能够轻松愉快地看了“小勇士历险记”走出影院，而它的影响是曲折而又长远的。谁会断然地说：我不需要凯凯茨那小家伙的乐观精神和冲劲儿呢？
