Xinhua News Agency, Kangding, December 5th. Part of the First Subgroup of the Central慰问团, led by Deputy Heads Awang Jiacho and Xia Ke Daodeng, arrived in Daofu County, at an altitude of 3,100 meters, on the afternoon of the 3rd.

Welcoming the慰问团 in the wide valley on the outskirts of Daofu were nearly 3,000 people, including residents of the urban area and suburbs, farmers and herdsmen who had come from remote mountain villages and pastures, officers and soldiers of the Tibetan Regiments, male and female Tibetan self-defense队员, and cadres from the Daofu County Party and government organs. More than 800 Lamas from the famous Lingque Temple and other temples in Daofu County also welcomed the慰问团, holding the flags of their respective temples and blowing conch shells and large horns and other instruments. The Daofu River valley was filled with cheers, and the welcoming masses crowded around the members of the慰问团 all the way to their residence.

Since leaving Kangding, the members of the First Subgroup of the Central慰问团 have met with tens of thousands of people along the more than 200-kilometer Kangzang highway to Daofu, conveying the care and greetings of the Central Committee to them; and sent subgroups to extend greetings and present commemorative badges to farmers and herdsmen in remote mountain areas, and distribute慰问 goods and relief clothing and food. In recent days, "Meeting people sent by Chairman Mao" has become the most exciting phrase in the areas through which the慰问团 has passed. "Tent villages" have appeared in many places. Farmers and herdsmen, men and women, and Lamas from temples under Tongda Mountain and Yala Mountain, carrying tents and tsampa, travel for several days over mountains to meet the慰问团 in Xinduqiao and Bamei Village on the highway. Young farmers and herdsmen in the Muya area also held horse races for the慰问团. Gongga Shenggen, a 48-year-old farmer from Bamei Village, told the members of the慰问团: "From the age of eight to forty-two, I lived a life of homelessness, wandering and begging, and I was still in debt; only after liberation did I have enough to eat and warm clothes to wear. Now I have my own house, an ox, and seven sheep. I have cultivated two 'dai' of land (each 'dai' is eighty-four jin; one 'dai' of land is the amount that can be sown with one 'dai' of seeds), and last year I harvested eighteen 'dai' of grain. Please convey my thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." Poor peasant Chai Luo and his wife Nima also led the members of the慰问团 to visit the ten new houses they had built and the new furniture they had acquired since the democratic reforms. He said: "Now we, who have lived in sheds all year round, can afford to eat, can walk, and have homes. Only by working hard can we be worthy of the Party and the government."

The song and dance troupe, film projection team, and medical team accompanying the慰问团 have begun their work along the way, and residents from dozens of miles away have come to watch movies or seek medical treatment.

Along the way, the members of the慰问团 also visited Huiyuan Temple, a famous temple in Qianning County, and presented the temple with a brocade banner and alms. The temple was built 220 years ago, and the Seventh Dalai Lama lived in it for six years. The Eleventh Dalai Lama was born in Huiyuan Township, where the temple is located. Gejiao Living Buddha and Khenpo Daodeng of Huiyuan Temple accompanied the members of the慰问团 on a tour of the temple and expressed their gratitude for the Central Committee's policy of protecting temples and freedom of religious belief.

    中央慰问团第一分团抵道孚
　　沿途慰问各族农民牧民
    许多地方出现了“帐篷村”；“会见毛主席派来的人”成了最激动人心的一句话
    新华社康定5日电　中央慰问团副团长阿旺嘉错、夏克刀登率领的第一分团部分人员，3日下午到达了海拔三千一百公尺的道孚县城。
    在道孚城郊宽阔的谷地迎接慰问团的有城区和郊区的各族居民，从遥远的山庄、牧场赶来的农民和牧民，藏民团的军官和士兵，男女藏族自卫队员，以及道孚县党政机关干部等近三千人。著名的灵雀寺和道孚县其他寺庙的八百多喇嘛，也举着各自寺庙的旗子，吹着海螺、大号等法器，欢迎慰问团。道孚河谷一片欢声，欢迎的群众一直把慰问团人员簇拥到住所。
    中央慰问团第一分团人员离开康定后，在到达道孚的二百多公里的康藏公路线上，已经和上万的人民会面，向他们传达了中央的关怀和慰问；并且派出小组向远离公路线的山区农民、牧民进行慰问和赠送纪念章，发放慰问品和救济衣粮。这些天来，“会见毛主席派来的人”，已经成了慰问团所经地区最激动人心的一句话。许多地方出现了“帐篷村”，通达山和雅拉山下的男女农民和牧民们，寺庙的喇嘛们，带着帐篷、?粑，翻山越岭地走几天路，来到公路线上的新都桥和八美村和慰问团会见。木雅区的青年农牧民们，还为慰问团举行了马赛。八美村四十八岁的老农民贡呷生根对慰问团人员说：“我从八岁到四十二岁，过的是无家无地、流浪讨乞的生活，还欠了一身债；解放后我才吃上饱饭，穿上暖衣。现在我有了自己的房子，有了一头耕牛和七只羊子，我开了二袋地（每袋八十四斤，一袋地就是可以撒一袋种子的土地），去年就打了十八袋粮食。请你们把我的感谢带给共产党和毛主席。”贫农柴洛和他的妻子尼玛还领着慰问团人员去参观他们在民主改革以后新盖起的十间新房和置办的新家具。他说：“现在我们这些整年住棚棚的人，也吃得起饭了，走得起路了，也有了家了。只有好好生产才对得起党和政府。”
    慰问团随行的歌舞团、电影放映队和医疗队，沿路展开工作，几十里外的居民都跑来观看电影或看病。
    慰问团人员在途中还访问了乾宁县著名的寺庙惠远寺，并向寺庙赠送了锦旗，放了布施。这座寺庙建于二百二十年前，第七世达赖喇嘛曾在这座寺里住过六年。第十一世达赖喇嘛就诞生在这座寺庙所在的惠远乡。惠远寺的歌教活佛和堪布道登陪同慰问团人员参观了寺庙，并对中央保护寺庙和宗教信仰自由的政策表示感激。
