    Wuhan Municipal People's Committee Notifies Subordinates:
    No Reckless Spending at Year's End
    (Our newspaper reports) The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee issued an "Emergency Notice on Strictly Controlling the 1956 Budget" on the 8th, which made clear provisions for preventing year-end spending sprees, controlling expenditures, and increasing revenue.
    The notice stipulates that at present, financial departments must strictly control the budget, and special emergency funds must be approved by the city. Otherwise, no additional funds will be allowed. For parts of the originally planned or already supplemented expenditure budget that have not been used, resolutely refrain from doing what can be avoided, and definitely postpone what can be delayed. For basic construction expenditures, except for projects that have been reviewed and approved by the Municipal People's Committee for construction, all other projects, regardless of whether materials have been prepared or not, are not allowed to be constructed. The funds will be recovered by the Finance Bureau at the end of the year.
    The notice stipulates that all institutions, enterprises, government offices, and organizations must stop adding furniture. Contracts that have already been signed, but for which production units have not yet prepared materials, must be cancelled. The practice of paying this year and delivering goods next year must be resolutely stopped. Other routine expenses should be saved as much as possible, except for the payment of wages. Leaders and financial departments at all levels should strictly review expenditures before the end of the year, keep a close watch, and prohibit the phenomenon of rushing to spend money when they see the end of the year approaching.
    The notice finally requires leaders at all levels to personally conduct a comprehensive review of their department's budget after receiving the notice. Finance, supervision, and banking departments should effectively strengthen supervision to ensure the implementation of the above regulations.
