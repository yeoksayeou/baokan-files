    The strike has received the sympathy and support of all workers in the Thai capital.

    After the company's attempt to suppress the strike by resorting to police force failed, it proposed to negotiate with the workers on the condition that they return to work. However, the workers' representatives declared that they would not stop the strike until the company met their demands.
