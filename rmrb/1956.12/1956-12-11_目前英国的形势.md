    Current Situation in Britain
    By Alan Winnington, Correspondent of the British "Daily Worker"
    If the leaders of the British Labour Party and trade unions were to take militant action now, they could easily overthrow the ruling Conservative government and ensure a Labour victory in the next general election. However, there are indications that Labour leaders are trying to suppress popular anger at the perpetrators of the aggression against Egypt and attempting to divert that anger towards the Soviet Union over the Hungarian question.
    Whether Eden stays or goes is not the main issue at all. The question now is the survival of the Conservative Party. The vast majority of the British people can currently be mobilized against the divided and weakened Conservative Party. Resolute action by the working class in all areas could further greatly expand the divisions already present within the Conservative Party and immediately bring the current government to its end.
    The British people are resolutely opposed to the aggression against Egypt. They now find that they have to pay a heavy price for Eden's aggression. As the scale of the price becomes fully apparent, popular anger will increase accordingly. This is not just about paying for the military adventure. The economic cost is far heavier, threatening to wipe out the economic gains that the working class has fought for over an entire generation, exacerbate unemployment, and stimulate already soaring prices.
    Many factory owners who have switched from coal to oil as fuel in recent years will have to lay off workers. Jaguar and Ford factories in Britain can only operate four days a week. The price of oil has risen by a third. This affects all car workers, car users, bus fares, and other aspects of daily life. Objective estimates suggest that the oil shortage will soon lead to half a million workers losing their jobs.
    Eden's aggression against Egypt has added to a series of heavy blows to the living standards of working people. The Conservative government has raised the prices of many essential goods. At the same time, the government was also preparing to implement new housing legislation, increasing rents for five million working-class families.
    Therefore, the preparation for Eden's aggression against Egypt not only shocked the British public because it was an act of overt imperialist aggression that people believed could not be repeated; it was also quite clear that this action would require huge amounts of money and social cost, a burden that, apart from the big capitalists and their lackeys, would be borne by almost all strata of the people.
    Thus, a high tide of working-class action emerged before the outbreak of the war of aggression against Egypt, initiated by the Communist Party but quickly spreading to the wider labor movement. The Trades Union Congress passed a resolution opposing the use of force by Britain against Egypt; the Labour Party sent leaders to see Eden. Thousands of citizens went to the House of Commons to see their MPs and demand that they not go to war against Egypt.
    Regardless of public opinion, Eden attacked Egypt, but the British public struck back at Eden. A general strike was proposed at trade union meetings; fifty thousand people gathered in Trafalgar Square; mass rallies were held across the country, demanding "law, not war." This movement was led by the Communist Party, started by courageous activists, and then taken over by the Labour Party, its scale being the most extensive mass movement seen in Britain for many years.
    The movement broke out at a time when workers were united, so it gathered a wider range of people and quickly involved some non-socialists, religious bodies, and even the United Nations Association, of which Eden was chairman.
    Crowds thronged to the Prime Minister's residence, demanding an end to the war. As the masses shouted their demands, mounted police charged into the crowd, beating them with batons. Many were arrested, many were injured.
    Internationally isolated and facing unbearable mass pressure at home, cabinet ministers resigned one after another, and the Conservative Party then resorted to intrigue. The ceasefire in Egypt was partly a victory for the forces of world peace, but also a trick by the Eden government, as British and French troops were prepared to remain stationed permanently in Egypt. They declared that they must remain in the Suez Canal area until UN forces could inherit and fulfill their aggressive aims.
    To do so, they had to rely on the support promised by the United States, especially American oil. But now the real purpose of the United States has been exposed: the United States encouraged Britain and France to take risks, and then took the opportunity to squeeze its two "allies" out of their spheres of influence in the Middle East and replace them. The United States said that it would not supply oil unless British and French troops withdrew from Egypt.
    So now the British government is not only under pressure from progressive forces around the world, including the British people, to withdraw its troops from Egypt, but it also finds that its "ally," the United States, is playing a double game, leaving it completely isolated.
    This American deception has caused unprecedented serious divisions within the British Conservative Party. More than a hundred Conservative MPs, led by the far-right militant Captain Waterhouse (known as the "Slaughterhouse Captain"), put forward a motion refusing the UN's demand for withdrawal from the Suez region, and threatening to force the Conservative government to collapse over this issue, which they could easily do. Their proposal "expressed regret at the attitude of the United States," believing that the American attitude "seriously endangered the Atlantic Alliance."
    It is worth noting that most of the MPs who are now vigorously attacking the United States are the very people who in the past most docilely supported the United States' policy of banning trade with the East and West and banning friendship with China. They hoped to use the strong anti-American sentiment of the broad masses of British people to put pressure on the United States to change its policy, ship oil, so that Britain could keep troops stationed in Egypt and achieve "international" control of the Suez Canal.
    Their entire argument for saving the North Atlantic Alliance only means that they are willing to be slaves of the United States again if the United States can satisfy their desires in this regard.
    But the world and the British people insisted on troop withdrawal, and Eden had to go on "vacation," and the decision to withdraw British and French troops was announced during his absence. But behind the scenes, the aim remains to reach a deal with the United States and use the United Nations to achieve the original goal of "international" control of the Suez Canal.
    In these days when the Conservative government is in turmoil, the labor movement is able to overthrow it at any time. The British people, who have long lost any illusions about the Conservative's domestic policies, are even more willing to respond to any call to take political or industrial action to overthrow this government.
    But Labour leader Gaitskell, who has seized leadership of the labor movement for himself and the Labour right wing, is now trying to confuse the goals of the movement and divert it in an anti-Soviet direction with the help of the Hungarian events.
    He said on November 6 that Britain must have a ceasefire in Egypt, his main reason being that Britain needs to re-coordinate with its allies and allies. He told the House of Commons that he wanted to bring the Labour Party and the Conservative Party into agreement with the United States and the British Empire in order to deal with the Soviet Union on the situation in Hungary.
    Within a few days, he was saying again that he (and presumably the Labour Party) would support a Conservative government without Eden.
    Obviously, for Gaitskell and his partners, the most important thing is to restore a two-party policy of anti-Soviet Cold War, rather than overthrowing the government that has brought so much disaster to the British people.
    This is the background to the current British political situation, in which the Conservatives are maintaining their power through a temporary compromise of internal contradictions. The fifteen Conservative MPs who abstained in the vote actually represented a hundred people who were very willing to oppose the government and replace Eden with someone who pursued a more insane policy.
    On the other hand, workers are raising new questions for the Conservative Party because they are opposed to bearing the cost of the aggression against Egypt and bearing the crisis created by the British Conservatives.
    Shipyard workers, train drivers, bus drivers, construction workers, and workers in many other industries are demanding wage increases. Car workers refuse to be laid off. Householders (many of whom voted for the Conservatives in the last general election) are also taking action against the government's new measures to raise rents and remove rent controls. Countless workers are facing unemployment, but the entire British working class is unwilling to relive the days of mass unemployment, although capitalists need it as a means of suppressing wages.
    In this situation, the "Daily Worker" and the Communist Party have issued a call for immediate elections - a slogan that will awaken the fighting spirit of all the best elements in the labor movement and will force the right-wing leaders to either lead the labor movement to overthrow the government, or expose their faces as behind-the-scenes allies of the Conservative Party.
    Eden once said that the Suez issue meant "oil," and oil was related to every British family. He was right. Eden's colonialist gamble on oil has brought disaster to these families, and this debt is only just beginning.
    Holding elections now can bring back to Parliament a Labour government supported by a vibrant and combative labor movement, which will force the bourgeoisie to retreat into a defensive position and change Britain's relations with other countries. Just as the mass movement once forced Gaitskell to oppose Eden's Suez War, it can also force the Labour leader to change its current policy (as Noel Baker said, "Cooperation with the United States is our primary task") and adopt a policy of defending the interests of British workers.
    The masses who have sent Eden to Jamaica can send a Labour Prime Minister into Parliament. The next step is to fight for this.

    目前英国的形势
    英国“工人日报”记者　阿兰·魏宁顿
    现在要是英国工党和工会的领袖们采取战斗的行动，就可以轻易地推翻当政的保守党政府，并且可以使得工党在今后的大选中获得胜利。但是目前有迹象表明，工党的领袖们正在竭力压低人民对挑起侵略埃及战争的祸首的愤怒，并且设法把这种愤怒转移到匈牙利问题上反对苏联。
    艾登留任与否完全不是一个主要的问题。现在的问题是保守党的去留问题。绝大部分的英国人民目前是可以被动员起来反对分裂的和衰弱的保守党的。工人阶级在各个方面的坚决行动都可以进一步大大地扩大在保守党内部已经出现的分裂，并且可以立即使现政府寿终正寝。
    英国人民坚决地反对侵略埃及。他们现在发现，他们不得不为艾登的侵略付出沉重代价。当代价的规模完全显现的时候，人们的愤怒也随之而增长。因为这不仅是要支付军事冒险的代价。经济上的代价更是沉重得多，它威胁着要抵消工人阶级在整整一代中所争来的经济利益，加甚失业现象，刺激本来已在飞涨的物价。
    许多在过去几年中改用石油来代替煤作为燃料的工厂主将不得不辞退工人。雅古阿汽车工厂和英国福特汽车工厂每周只能开工四天。石油的价格已上涨了三分之一。这就影响到所有的汽车工人、汽车使用者、公共汽车票价以及日常生活的其他各方面。客观的估计认为，缺乏石油迅将促使五十万工人失业。
    艾登对埃及的侵略加重了对劳动人民生活水平的一连串的沉重打击。保守党政府提高了许多主要商品的价格。与此同时，政府当时还准备实行新房租立法，增加五百万工人家庭的房租。
    因此，艾登侵略埃及的准备工作不仅震惊了英国的公众，因为这将是人民相信不可能重演的那种公开的帝国主义侵略行为；而且十分清楚，这个行动需要巨额的金钱和社会的代价的，这种负担，除了大资本家及其奴才以外，几乎将是由各个阶层的人民承担。
    所以，在侵略埃及的战争爆发以前就出现了工人阶级行动的高潮，这个高潮由共产党发軔，但是很快便扩展到广大的工人运动中去。职工大会决议反对英国对埃及使用武力；工党派出领导人去见艾登。数以千计的公民到下议院去见他们的议员并要求不对埃及作战。
    不顾舆论趋向，艾登袭击了埃及，但英国的公众还击了艾登。在工会的会议上提出了总罢工；在特拉法尔加广场上聚集了五万人民；全国各地都举行了群众集会，提出“要法律不要战争”。这个运动是共产党领导的，由果敢的积极分子开始的，然后由工党接过去，其规模之大是多年来英国所罕见的最广泛的群众性运动。
    运动正当工人们团结一致的时候爆发，所以它聚集了更广泛的群众，并且很快就把一些非社会主义者，团宗教体，甚至连艾登当主席的联合国协会也卷进来。
    人群涌向首相府，要求结束战争。当群众高呼他们的要求的时候，骑警冲入人群中，用大棒乱殴群众。许多人被逮捕，许多人被打伤。
    在国际上的孤立、在国内又遭受到难以忍受的群众压力，内阁阁员相继辞职，保守党于是施展阴谋诡计。在埃及的停火，一方面是世界和平力量的一个胜利，而另一方面也何尝不是艾登政府的一个诡计，英、法军队已准备常驻埃及。他们宣称他们必须留在苏伊士运河地区，直到联合国部队能够继承和实现他们的侵略目的为止。
    要想这样做，他们得依靠美国所许诺的支持，尤其是美国的石油。但是现在美国的真正的目的暴露了：美国鼓励英、法冒险，然后乘机把它的两个“盟友”从中东的势力范围中排挤掉，并取而代之。美国说，除非英、法部队从埃及撤退，否则不供应石油。
    所以现在英国政府不仅是受到了包括英国人民在内的全世界进步力量的压力，要它从埃及撤兵，它还发现自己的“盟友”美国在玩弄两面手法，使它陷于完全孤立之境。
    美国的这种欺骗行为造成了英国保守党空前的严重分裂。一百多个保守党议员，在极右派的好战分子华特豪斯上尉（以屠宰场上尉而知名）的领导下提出了一项动议，拒绝联合国提出的从苏伊士地区撤兵的要求，并且威胁要就这个问题迫使保守党政府垮台，这一点他们是很容易做到的。他们的提案“对美国的态度表示遗憾”，认为美国的态度“严重地危及大西洋联盟”。
    值得指出的是，大部分现在极力攻击美国的议员，就是过去最驯服地支持美国的禁止东西贸易、禁止对华友好的政策的人。他们指望以广大的各阶层英国人民的强烈的反美情绪来对美国施加压力，使它改变政策，运送石油，以使英国能够把军队留驻埃及，并达到对苏伊士运河的“国际”管制的目的。
    他们的挽救北大西洋联盟的全部论点只意味着，如果美国能够满足他们这方面的欲望的话，他们甘愿再作美国的奴才。
    但是全世界和英国人民都坚持要求撤兵，艾登只好出走“休假”，而且就在他离职期间宣布了英法撤兵的决定。但是在背地里，其目的仍然是要同美国达成交易，并且利用联合国来达到原来的“国际”管制苏伊士运河的目标。
    在保守党政府陷于风雨飘摇的这些日子里，劳工运动随时都能够把它推翻。早已对保守党的国内政策不存什么幻想的英国人民，更是十分愿意响应任何号召，采取政治上的或产业上的行动来推翻这个政府。
    但是工党领袖盖次克尔，已为自己和工党右翼夺得了劳工运动的领导权，现在便设法混淆运动的目标，并借助于匈牙利事件把它引向反苏的方向。
    他在11月6日说，英国必须在埃及停火，他的主要理由是英国需要同它的友邦和盟国重新统一步调。他对下议院说，他要使工党和保守党同美国和大英帝国协同一致，以便就匈牙利的局势对付苏联。
    没有几天，他又在说，他（想来还有工党）会支持一个没有艾登的保守党政府。
    显然，在盖次克尔和他的伙伴来说，最关心的毋宁是恢复一个反苏冷战的两党政策，而不是推翻这个已给英国人民带来了如许灾难的政府。
    这就是当前英国政局的背景，保守党人以内部矛盾的暂时妥协而维持其政权。在投票中弃权的十五个保守党人，实际上是代表了一百人，这些人是很愿意反对政府，要用一个推行更为疯狂的政策的人来代替艾登。
    另一方面，工人们正在向保守党提出了新的问题，因为他们反对负担侵略埃及的代价，反对承当英国保守党制造的危机。
    造船工人、火车司机、公共汽车司机、建筑工人和许多其他各业工人正要求增加工资。汽车工人拒绝被解雇。住户们（当中许多人在上届大选中投票支持保守党）也正在行动起来，反对政府提高房租和取消管制房租的新措施。无数工人正面临着失业，但是整个英国工人阶级都不愿意重过大批失业的日子，虽然资本家需要它以作为压低工资的手段。
    在这种形势之下，“工人日报”和共产党发出了马上进行选举的号召——这个口号将唤起劳工运动中的所有优秀分子的战斗精神，并将迫使右翼领袖：或是领导劳工运动推翻政府，或是暴露出自己的保守党的幕后同盟者的嘴脸来。
    艾登曾经说过，苏伊士问题意味着“石油”，而石油是关系着每一个英国的家庭。他是说对了。艾登在石油问题上从事的殖民主义者的赌博，已经给这些家庭带来了灾难，而这笔孽债还不过是刚刚开始。
    现在来进行选举，可以给国会带回来一个受到朝气蓬勃而斗志昂扬的劳工运动所支持的工党政府，这将迫使资产阶级退居守势，并改变英国同其他国家之间的关系。正如同群众运动曾经迫使盖次克尔反对艾登的苏伊士战争一样，它还能够迫使工党领袖改变它的现行政策（如诺尔·贝克所说的“同美国合作是我们的首要任务”），而采取保卫英国工人利益的政策。
    已经把艾登送到牙买加去的群众，就可以把一个工党首相送进国会里去，下一步就是为此而斗争。
                                        （立方译）
