Reactions to Criticism

    Regarding the Handling of the "Father and Son" Incident
    The case of Zhang Fengru, former Deputy Secretary of the CPC Yangquan City Committee of Shanxi Province, mistreating his father, after being exposed by this newspaper (see the "Father and Son" article on page 8, July 19), attracted widespread attention from readers. This newspaper received more than 600 letters from readers, all demanding serious action. The editorial department of this newspaper requested the CPC Shanxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection to investigate and handle the matter. Now, the CPC Shanxi Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection and the CPC Yangquan City Committee have completed their investigation and have taken serious action against those involved. Zhang Fengru himself has made a profound self-criticism and has been given the punishment of being removed from his Party post. The handling authorities have ordered Zhang Fengru's wife, Li Lianhua, to make a profound self-criticism and have exempted her from disciplinary action. The CPC Yangquan City Committee has also conducted a self-criticism regarding the errors of bureaucracy and insufficient democratic style in this matter.
    In addition, there are discrepancies between the "Father and Son" article and the actual facts. Zhang Fengru's father was not a diligent and capable farmer, but had always been relatively lazy and had suffered from mental illness long before Zhang Fengru joined the revolution. He was not driven mad by Zhang Fengru's mistreatment. After May 1953, his father's mental illness never improved, affecting his work and life. Therefore, Zhang Fengru lost the compassion and sympathy he should have had for the patient, gradually developing into mistreatment. Comrade Yu Jiang, one of the authors of "Father and Son," was aware of these circumstances but did not explain them in the report. Comrade Gu Ye, a reporter for this newspaper, did not investigate the situation deeply and comprehensively enough and is also responsible for this.

    Correcting the Error of Randomly Changing Store Signs
    The article "Explosive Non-staple Foods" by Sun Qian and Hai Mo, published on page 8 of the People's Daily on July 2, correctly criticized our county's mistake of randomly changing store names, regardless of the original business characteristics and the nature of the goods, during the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicrafts. After checking, we have decided to restore the original store names and correct the erroneous store signs according to the different nature of the goods.

    对批评的反应
    关于“父与子”事件的处理
    中共山西省阳泉市委前副秘书长张枫如虐待父亲的问题，经本报揭发后（见7月19日八版“父与子”一文），引起了广大读者的注意，本报前后共收到六百多封读者来信，都要求严肃处理。本报编辑部曾请中共山西省监察委员会调查处理，现在中共山西省监察委员会和中共阳泉市委员会已经调查结束，并对有关人员作了严肃处理。张枫如本人作了深刻的思想检讨，并受到撤销党内职务的处分。处理机关已责成张枫如的爱人李莲花作出深刻检讨，免予纪律处分。中共阳泉市委会也就此事检讨了官僚主义和民主作风不够的错误。
    另外，“父与子”一文，也有同事实有出入的地方。张枫如的父亲并不是一个勤劳能干的农民，而是一贯较为懒惰，并且早在张枫如参加革命以前就患有神经病，并非张枫如虐待疯的。在1953年5月后，他父亲的神经病始终不见好转，影响了他的工作和生活，因此失去了对病人应有的体谅和同情心，逐渐发展到虐待行为。“父与子”作者之一玉江同志，对这些情况是了解的，但在报道中却没有交代。本报记者顾页同志了解情况不够深入、全面，对此也是有责任的。

    改正乱挂商店招牌的错误
    7月2日人民日报八版刊登孙谦、海默的“会爆炸的副食品”一文，对我县在对私营工商业、手工业进行社会主义改造的工作中，不管原来商店的经营特点、商品性质，一律把商店的名字乱加修改的错误的批评是正确的。我们经过检查后，决定将原有商号名字恢复，并根据不同商品性质修改错误的商店招牌。
