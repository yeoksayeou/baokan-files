Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 8th: The Eighth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party opened on December 8th at the Palazzo dei Congressi in Rome. Approximately 1,900 delegates, guests, and representatives from fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties from nineteen countries attended the congress. Many Italian and foreign journalists were present to cover the event.

After the presidium of the congress was elected, Giuseppe Dozza, a leader of the Italian Communist Party, delivered the opening speech. He congratulated those attending the congress and expressed warm fraternal sentiments to the representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries.

The General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, delivered a report on the first item on the agenda, "Striving for Italy's Path to Socialism and for a Democratic Government of the Working Class." His report was met with thunderous applause.

Togliatti began by analyzing the international situation. He pointed out that "the entire civilized world has been in danger of being drawn into the vortex of a general conflict caused by the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt." Togliatti said that this aggression not only demonstrated the rapacious nature of the Anglo-French financial groups and the desire of Britain and France to preserve their colonial rule, but also showed that they wanted to hinder the easing of international tensions and restore the Cold War.

Togliatti strongly condemned the reactionary forces for attempting to speculate on the Hungarian incident and using it to conduct despicable anti-communist propaganda.

Togliatti emphasized the great significance of the results of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the workers and socialist movement throughout the world. He said that when Italian Communists considered "the role that that country and the party that governs it play in the socialist world and in the international communist movement," they felt deep affection for the Soviet Union.

Togliatti then spoke about the domestic situation. When talking about Italy's socio-economic problems, he emphasized the need to change Italy's current economic structure in order to lead Italy on the path to socialism. Togliatti pointed out that implementing land reform, nationalizing large monopoly capital enterprises, implementing tax reform, and strictly abiding by the Republic's constitution are the current tasks in this regard.

Togliatti expressed his firm belief that the Italian Communist Party "can lead the working class and the entire Italian people to successfully build a socialist society."

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 8th: The delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which is attending the Eighth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party, arrived in Italy on the 7th. The delegation is composed of Furtseva, alternate member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Secretary of the Moscow City Committee and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Rezalin, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Secretary of the Stalingrad Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union also originally sent An. Mi. Suslov as a representative, but the Italian government rudely overturned its original decision and announced that it would not issue an entry visa to Suslov.

    意共第八次全国代表大会开幕
　  陶里亚蒂痛斥英法侵埃和卑鄙的反共宣传
　  苏联共产党派福尔采娃和热加林参加大会
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社罗马8日讯：意大利共产党第八次全国代表大会8日在罗马会议大厦开幕。参加代表大会的代表、来宾和来自十九个国家的兄弟共产党和工人党的代表一共有一千九百人左右。许多意大利记者和外国记者来到会场进行采访。
    在选出代表大会主席团之后，意大利共产党领导人员朱塞佩·多萨致开幕词。他向参加代表大会的人祝贺，并且向各国共产党和工人党的代表表示了热烈的兄弟情谊。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂就第一项议程“为意大利走向社会主义的道路、为劳动阶级的民主政府而奋斗”做了报告，他的报告博得了暴风雨般的鼓掌。
    陶里亚蒂首先分析了国际局势。他指出，“整个文明世界曾经遭到被卷入由英法侵略埃及而引起的普遍冲突的漩涡中去的危险。”陶里亚蒂说，这种侵略不仅表现了英法金融集团的强盗习气，不仅表现了英国和法国希望保存它们的殖民统治，而且还说明它们想阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和和恢复冷战。
    陶里亚蒂痛斥反动势力企图对匈牙利事件进行投机和利用这一事件来作卑鄙的反共宣传。
    陶里亚蒂强调指出苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的会议结果对全世界工人和社会主义运动的重大意义。他说，当意大利共产党人考虑到“我们承认那个国家和管理那个国家的党在社会主义世界以及在国际共产主义运动中所起的作用”的时候，他们对苏联是怀着深深爱戴的感情的。
    陶里亚蒂接着谈国内情况。他在谈到意大利的社会经济问题的时候强调指出了改变意大利目前的经济结构以便使意大利走向社会主义道路的必要性。陶里亚蒂指出，实行土地改革、将大垄断资本企业收归国有，实行税收改革和严格遵守共和国宪法，是这一方面的当前任务。
    陶里亚蒂表示深信，意大利共产党“能够领导工人阶级和意大利全国人民胜利地建设社会主义社会”。
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社罗马8日电：参加意大利共产党第八次全国代表大会的苏联共产党代表团7日到达意大利。代表团是由苏联共产党中央委员会主席团候补委员、莫斯科市委员会和苏联共产党中央委员会书记福尔采娃和苏联共产党中央委员会委员、苏联共产党斯大林格勒州委员会第一书记热加林组成的。
    苏联共产党本来还派了安·米·苏斯洛夫为代表，但是意大利政府粗暴地推翻了自己原先的决定，宣布不发给苏斯洛夫以入境签证。
