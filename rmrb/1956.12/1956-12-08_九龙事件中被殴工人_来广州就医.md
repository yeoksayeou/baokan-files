Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 6th. The Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Affairs Office has recently received seventy-one injured workers from Hong Kong who have come here for medical treatment. They were all severely injured in the Kowloon riots when special agents bloodily washed over Tsuen Wan. Although it has been more than a month since they were beaten, many of them still bear scars on their bodies.

A portion of these injured workers are currently hospitalized in the affiliated hospital of the Guangzhou Medical College, where they are receiving warm treatment and care from doctors and nurses. The other injured workers have also been placed in comfortable accommodations for recuperation, allowing them to recover their health quickly.
