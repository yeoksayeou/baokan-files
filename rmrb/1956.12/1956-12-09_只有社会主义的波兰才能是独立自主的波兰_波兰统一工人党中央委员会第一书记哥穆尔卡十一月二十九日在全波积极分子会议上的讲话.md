Only a Socialist Poland Can Be an Independent and Autonomous Poland
Speech by Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, at a Meeting of All-Poland Activists on November 29

Dear Comrades, Citizens!

In the lives of people, there are days that, like boundary markers, separate one period of life from another. It can be said with certainty that the days of the plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, held in the very tense month of October, belong to such days. These sessions adopted resolutions that triggered a transformation in the life of the entire nation.

Today, only a few weeks after the end of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party (at which resolutions were adopted that brought about a transformation in the life of the entire nation), it is, of course, impossible to say that all the decisions of the Eighth Plenary Session have been implemented, because the Eighth Plenary Session formulated a broad program for reforming our political and economic life.

The implementation of many principles announced in the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session will take many years. The road to achieving the goals set is long and arduous. This road is not always easy and smooth. The program of action stipulated by the Eighth Plenary Session requires creative and intense work from millions of our citizens, and above all, conscious, calm, and patient efforts from the entire people.

Normalization of Polish-Soviet Relations is a Victory for the Common Cause

Although we are only standing at the beginning of the new road, in the short period since the Eighth Plenary Session, one of the primary and principled demands of the Polish people, which occupies the first place in the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, has already been realized.

We have stated what we see as the causes of certain abnormalities existing in Polish-Soviet relations. It is difficult to find a nation in the world as sensitive to its independence and sovereignty as the Polish nation. This sensitivity is a product of the historical development of our people. The ten centuries of tragedy of the Polish state and the enslavement suffered by generations of the Polish nation, partitioned by neighboring aggressors, have deepened in our national psychology a special sensitivity to the issues of our country's independence and sovereignty, a sensitivity that other nations, independent for a long time, cannot understand.

In the post-war friendly relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, there have been some facts that have irritated the Polish people. These include issues such as difficulties and delays in the repatriation of Poles from the Soviet Union, the lack of detailed regulations governing the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Poland, the issue of Poland supplying coal to the Soviet Union at special prices, and other issues of varying degrees of importance. Enemies of the Polish people's regime, both domestic and foreign, have stirred up trouble on these issues, which are minor to the people and our party. They used this opportunity to conduct slanderous propaganda against the Soviet Union and against the vital interests of the Polish state.

According to this propaganda, the Soviet Union should be held responsible for all the shortcomings and problems in our country. Whenever there is a shortage of meat or oil in the market, reactionary propaganda incites the people, telling them that this is because the Soviet Union has taken away our meat and oil. For example, the supply of cement to the countryside has always been insufficient, so the gentlemen of the "Radio Free Europe" insist on convincing the farmers that they cannot buy cement because Poland sells half of its domestic cement production to the Soviet Union.

It is as if the Soviet Union should be held responsible for everything that happens in Poland, for the policies of the party and the government, and for production and trade.

The political interests of those who are hostile to socialism and oppose the people's regime have required, both in the past and now, that absurdly anti-Soviet propaganda be widely carried out among the Polish people. One can imagine how frustrated they must have been when they heard the news that all the abnormalities that previously existed in Polish-Soviet relations had been eliminated. We have removed one of the best handles for their slanderous propaganda.

The negotiations and talks held by the delegation of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Government of the Polish People's Republic with the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Government of the Soviet Union, as well as the results of these negotiations stated in the joint statement, are a great achievement of the wise policies of both sides.

The demands made by the Eighth Plenary Session regarding Polish-Soviet relations were affirmed and recognized in the declaration issued by the Soviet government on October 30 this year regarding the relations that should exist between socialist countries.

The part of the Polish-Soviet declaration in November concerning Polish-Soviet relations is merely a formal reaffirmation of the principles that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government had long recognized. The Polish-Soviet relations established on the principles of equality and respect for sovereignty are sometimes regarded as a unilateral victory for Poland. We cannot accept this assessment because it distorts the essence of the issue, the content of which belongs to the essence of socialism.

The normalization of Polish-Soviet relations, the establishment of this relationship on the principles of equality and respect for sovereignty, is a victory for both Poland and the Soviet Union, because our common cause has triumphed, the idea of socialism has triumphed, and the idea of socialism only recognizes one rule of law – the equality of all countries, large and small.

Soviet Union's Just Position on the Hungarian Incident

In a world that is not yet united but divided into two opposing camps, where the fate of humanity is at a critical juncture, and the weight on one side of the scale is not yet heavy enough to allow humanity to advance along the path of lasting peace according to its heartfelt wishes without being dragged into a terrible and destructive war that could lead to human annihilation, in such a world and under such circumstances, regrettably, the socialist rule of law – the equality of all nations, the principle of socialism, which is inextricably linked to the idea of international solidarity of the working class – the principle of non-interference by one country in the internal affairs of another, can sometimes be distorted.

I am referring to the tragic events in Hungary. As everyone knows, this incident has been used by all forces hostile to socialism to launch a frenzied campaign against the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties of some countries.

Our party has already expressed its opinion on this issue. We deeply regret that the situation in Hungary has developed to such an extent that Soviet troops had to be used in the internal struggle of that country at the request of the Hungarian government. However, even when things developed to the point of this intervention, we were all very clear that the Soviet Union was not seeking economic exploitation in Hungary, that the Soviet Union did not intend to extract material benefits from the labor of the Hungarian people, or to turn Hungary into its colony.

This intervention is different in nature from the military intervention of Western countries in Egypt. The intervention in Egypt is not only against the national sovereignty of Egypt but also a continuation of the bankrupt colonial policy that has brought political oppression and economic exploitation to many countries.

It is worth noting that those who are shouting the loudest against the Soviet intervention in the Hungarian events are precisely those political figures who place their policies and hopes on foreign intervention, albeit from another side. These people, with their high-sounding radio propaganda and their promises of assistance for so-called liberation, incite the hostile elements in Hungary and should bear a significant responsibility for the blood shed on Hungarian soil.

Regrettably, it must be pointed out that some people in Hungary believed in the promise of this assistance. This "assistance" should be seen as an attempt to use the Hungarian issue to launch a world war. The misfortune of the Hungarian people lies in the fact that the party did not lead the struggle to meet legitimate demands in time, and did not lead the development process in line with the people's demands for necessary socialist reforms.

The situation in Poland is different. Therefore, our reforms, now and in the future, are reforms within the socialist sphere. Therefore, the great turning point was completed peacefully and smoothly, and therefore, the normalization of Polish-Soviet relations based on the principle of socialist equality was achieved. The results of the Moscow talks and the Polish-Soviet declaration can serve as an example of the kind of relations that should exist between socialist countries. We firmly believe that Soviet-Hungarian relations will also be established on these principles. We say this based on our own experience and taking into account that the representatives of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government fully understood the legitimate demands we made during the recent talks in Moscow.

Polish-Soviet Understanding on Economic Issues

Among these demands, the main one was the issue of coal supply, for which Poland had assumed obligations under the agreement of August 16, 1945. This agreement was unfavorable to Poland because it stipulated that we sell a certain amount of coal at very low prices. This was an unusual trade agreement. It was Poland's obligation to compensate the Soviet Union for relinquishing German property on the former German territories ceded to Poland and transferred to Poland.

I do not want to examine the legal aspects of this issue here. It is a fact that the Polish government in 1945 signed an agreement with the Soviet government that was unfavorable to Poland. Various international agreements signed by the Polish government before September were also such agreements in a certain sense.

In relations between countries, the principle is generally accepted that any party that signs a treaty must abide by all the provisions of the treaty, even if the treaty brings serious losses to one party. Governments may change, but the treaties signed remain unchanged. The above principles were not adopted when discussing the demands made by Poland regarding the agreements signed with the Soviet Union that were unfavorable to Poland.

The Soviet government and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as the government of a socialist country, treated the issue of the signed Polish-Soviet agreements in a different way. The unfavorable aspect of this agreement to Poland was related to the unequal relations that had formed during Stalin's lifetime. The Soviet government and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to completely eliminate all past phenomena that violated socialist principles and the equality of socialist countries. Therefore, the Soviet side accepted the demands we made regarding past events.

When settling accounts for the coal supplied by Poland to the Soviet Union under the agreement of August 16, 1945, the Soviet government recognized Poland's demand based on the world market price of coal, which amounted to approximately $500 million. The Soviet government correspondingly reduced this amount from the debts owed by Poland to the Soviet Union in the past due to various loans.

It should be mentioned that before the war, foreign capitalists obtained large amounts of profits and dividends from our national economy. No one has ever demanded the return of these profits created by Polish workers. One could have suggested that those "revivalist" politicians, who are so sensitive to Poland's current sovereignty, solve this problem, but when they themselves ruled Poland, they were unwilling to know and see the fact that Poland's national sovereignty was being undermined by foreign capitalists who exploited our economy. Capitalists will never return to the Polish people what they have taken and what rightfully belongs to them. Otherwise, they would not be capitalists.

But the Soviet Union recognized our fair demands. It did not question the treaty obligations previously undertaken by the Polish government and returned to us the difference in price for the coal already supplied. (Applause) This fact cannot be seen merely as a matter within the narrow financial scope. The significance of this fact is particularly powerful when evaluating the changes that have taken place in Polish-Soviet relations, and when evaluating the changes that have occurred due to the elimination of deviations that once existed in the socialist spirit and in the internal relations of socialist countries, as well as in the relations between socialist countries and between parties.

The Soviet government also agreed to jointly study and affirm our demands regarding transit freight transport on Polish state railways. This refers to freight transport for which freight payments were once suppressed.

The two sides will jointly study and decide on some other minor demands, such as the issue of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in our country using our transportation equipment. In addition to the grain obtained by Poland on credit and the new loan of 700 million rubles used to pay for goods, the Soviet Union also agreed to cancel Poland's debt of approximately 110 million rubles for the so-called surplus military material loan received in 1947. This amount is equivalent to the remaining portion of this loan that Poland has not yet repaid, and it is also included in the total amount of loans exceeding 2.1 billion rubles that Poland received from the Soviet Union.

The Truth about Western So-Called Aid

Speaking of which, I would also like to point out that after the war, Poland also received a so-called surplus military material loan of approximately $38 million from the United States. We used this loan to purchase automobiles and other materials left over after the demobilization of the American army. The equipment purchased with this money has long been damaged, but Poland still has to pay $1.3 million in principal and approximately $70,000 in interest in gold every year to repay this debt.

The Polish government also bears the so-called wartime debt owed by the Polish government-in-exile to the United Kingdom, which was used to maintain Polish administrative organs, schools, and Polish refugees abroad during the war.

Whether it is the "surplus military material loan" or the wartime debt, both add to the burden on our balance of payments. I mention this because foreign propaganda has created the perception among some people in Poland that Western countries, led by the United States, are ready to provide Poland with significant assistance, but the Polish government opposes this assistance. The Polish government has already made a public statement on this issue. The two examples mentioned above of Poland's debts to the United States and the United Kingdom may serve as good topics for foreign radio stations to promote aid to Poland. If so, please first raise the demand to cancel the above-mentioned debts of the Polish state. (Applause)

Soviet Troops Stationed in Poland are a Guarantee of Peace and Polish Security

The Central Committee of the Party and the delegation of the Polish government also resolved the issue of the repatriation of Poles from the Soviet Union, which the Polish people are concerned about. (Applause) The representatives of the CPSU and the Soviet government agreed to the position of the Polish delegation on this issue without discussion. The two sides adopted a principle: the scope of repatriation should include separated families, that is, those who have relatives in Poland and who, for unavoidable reasons, such as illness, military service, residence in concentration camps, or deportation, were unable to be repatriated in 1945-1947.

The Soviet government also agreed to repatriate those Polish people who are serving sentences. The repatriation method is either to release them early or to hand them over to the Polish authorities. The repatriation issue will be determined by a special Polish-Soviet agreement to be concluded by the two sides. The lack of such an agreement has hindered the speed of repatriation until now.

The two sides also formulated the basic principles governing the status of Soviet troops temporarily stationed on the western border of Poland. The issue of the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Poland is inextricably linked to the overall international situation, the security of our western border, the security of the Soviet Union and all people's democracies, and in particular, to the re-militarization of West Germany, the stationing of foreign troops on German territory, and the participation of some Western countries in the Atlantic Alliance.

The Party and those who exercise state power, especially the Polish United Workers' Party and its leading organs, bear a great responsibility for the policies of the country, for the fate of the people and the country. Any wrong political measures, any ill-considered decisions can bring endless harm to the entire nation. Neither we nor our people can forget for a minute that Western countries still do not recognize our Oder-Neisse border, that revanchist groups in the Federal Republic of Germany do not want to give up their revisionist plans and conspiracies to change our western border, and that even those German parties that list themselves as democratic parties and workers' parties have not yet taken a stand against revisionism.

We should always remember the September tragedy of 1939. Anyone who has experienced this tragedy and remembers it should be concerned about the security of our country, the integrity and inviolability of our borders.

The Polish-Soviet alliance is a crucial issue for Poland in the present and in the future. We solemnly declare once again that as long as the situation in foreign relations is not sufficient to guarantee the security and integrity of our country, we will consider it appropriate for a certain number of Soviet troops to be stationed in Poland. (Applause)

Strengthening the Solidarity of Socialist Countries

As far as relations between countries are concerned, our alliance with the socialist camp and our position in the socialist world are the foundation of our sovereignty and what determines our position in the world. On this road, we have taken a big step forward. Our party has taken the initiative to eliminate everything that exists in Polish-Soviet relations that could hinder the improvement of this relationship and that is inconsistent with the basic principles of socialism. Today, the party can tell the entire people that this task has been completed.

In accordance with the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session and the declaration issued by the Soviet government on October 30 this year, the mutual relations between the Polish People's Republic and the Soviet Union are based entirely on the principles of mutual equality, respect for territorial integrity, national independence, and sovereignty, and non-interference. in each other's internal affairs. (Applause)

This significant event has opened a new page in Polish-Soviet relations, and it is also a new page in international socialism, a page of increasingly closer friendship, cooperation, and mutual understanding that unites us with another powerful socialist country, the People's Republic of China. The close relationship with the People's China has only seven years of history in total, but this relatively short period of time has thoroughly proven that the People's Republic of China is our well-tested good friend. (Applause)

The Chinese government's statement on the issue of relations between socialist countries and many other propositions are fully in line with the views of our party. These propositions are the achievements of the Chinese Communist Party's Marxist-Leninist independent creation, which has been successfully developed on the socialist road in China.

Close friendly relations and the most closely related common interests unite us with Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other people's democratic countries. The same is true of relations with Yugoslavia. Our relations with Yugoslavia have not only been normalized but have also completely eliminated the things that once divided our two countries in the past years.

Not all Communist and Workers' Parties have the same views on the significance of the changes in Poland and the policies of our party. We believe that this is not surprising. We believe that the development of events in our country will prove that the path we are taking under our conditions is correct, and undoubtedly, we will also contribute to the experience of the entire workers' movement. We fervently hope that relations between countries around the world will be built on the basis of friendship and peace. Poland hopes to promote this.

Anyone who understands the terrible consequences of using atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons will never advocate using war to resolve disputes and contradictions between countries around the world. We will spare no effort to improve relations with all countries (as long as they also have this desire) and to establish economic and cultural cooperation with these countries.

We are also willing to discuss political issues related to both sides with countries around the world in order to seek solutions that can help alleviate international tensions to some extent, help bring each other's views closer on various disputes, promote the victory of the principles of peaceful coexistence, and promote the development of international economic and cultural exchanges.

The Party Has Made Mistakes, But Achievements Are Primary

The tasks put forward by the Eighth Plenary Session in the scope of eliminating deviations and alien dross in the socialist system and democratizing social and political life, as well as the tasks including all economic issues (the purpose of which is to form a unique socialist form suitable for our country's conditions) are only in the first stage of the implementation process.

Although it is still too early to draw preliminary conclusions on the above issues today, based on our own and others' experiences in the past few weeks, we can still talk about this topic.

First, let's talk about our party. We do not intend to, and should not, minimize any mistakes, deviations, and their consequences in the work of the Polish United Workers' Party. We are unwilling, and should not, blame all the bad aspects of the past on the objective conditions under which our party worked.

The Polish United Workers' Party has made mistakes in its work. The Polish United Workers' Party was not always right on certain issues, and its political line was not always correct. However, there is a major achievement that makes it worthy of the title of a workers' party, that is, the party members, especially the party's central leadership, sharply and ruthlessly criticized these mistakes in front of the entire people.

This criticism arose within the party, within the ranks of the party activists, unfolded in several plenary sessions of the Central Committee, and finally led to the necessary changes in the party's political line and the members of the leading organs at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Our party did not hesitate to tell the people the reasons for this great shame in their entirety, even though the truth was often unfavorable to its own members.

No party, no person can avoid making mistakes in practice, because it cannot be done. But there have been very few people, and it is even harder to find such people in the history of our party, who believe that they have an obligation not only to tell the people the good aspects of their activities but also to report the bad aspects and have the courage to do so. To dare to take this step, one must have a great sense of responsibility for what one says and for the policies one implements. The fact that the criticism of the bad aspects of our party comes from our own ranks gives us the right to ask those who only see the mistakes of our party and are unwilling to see other things: Why have they never had such courage as we have? Why have they never told the people about the many more serious and tragic mistakes they made during the various periods when they were responsible or partially responsible for the fate of the people and the Polish state? (Applause)

We want to ask: Which party has ever admitted its responsibility for the collapse of Poland in September 1939? (Applause) Which party has ever had the courage to tell the people that the Warsaw Uprising – which was not the responsibility of one party, but which caused the residents of Warsaw to bleed and turned the Polish capital into ruins – was a tragic rash act, an unforgivable political mistake? Which party, which supported the anti-Soviet policies of the Sanacja regime and the Polish reactionaries for many years, has ever admitted that, from the perspective of the vital interests of the state and the Polish people, this policy was harmful and caused countless harms to Poland? You must know that because of these mistakes, because of the reactionary policies from which these mistakes arose, the Polish people paid the price of falling under Hitler's control, paid the price of millions of lives, and suffered huge economic losses.

There are still tens of thousands of people living in Warsaw in simple huts, in basements, in attics, or in narrow apartments. They and the people's regime are heavily burdened by the legacy of the hypocrisy and harmful policies of those who have ruled the people for many years.

Is no one responsible for all this? Is all this an inevitable historical necessity? Today, some people throw stones at our party, seeing the dust in our eyes but not seeing the sand in their own eyes. What moral right do these people have to do so? (Applause)

Mistakes are not enough to explain our party's policies. What is enough to explain is the fact that the country has recovered from the ruins of war and economic decline. The mistakes made in economic policy do not obscure the vigorous development of productive forces, the development of our industry, and the continuous increase in national income. Despite the various economic difficulties we are currently experiencing, the prospects for our country's economic development are satisfactory. One or two trees cannot obscure the forest. Whoever only sees the mistakes in our party's activities sees nothing at all. It is precisely those who see nothing or are unwilling to see that believe that the new political line of striving for the democratization of all aspects of people's lives, announced by the Eighth Plenary Session of our party, should finally restore bourgeois democracy.

Capitalist Restoration Will Never Be Allowed

Although the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session have also received the courteous support of these people, these resolutions are only a transitional stage for them, after which another stage should come. But they cannot see clearly what will happen in the second stage, if it is not to restore the old landlord-capitalist relations before the war. Therefore, we must dispel all the illusions of these stage politicians, that is, bourgeois politicians, no matter what guise they operate under. (Applause)

The Polish United Workers' Party is making every effort to combat the deviations and mistakes that distorted socialist ideas in the past. It is not intended to restore capitalist relations in the country. The party's criticism of the bad aspects of the past is to consolidate socialist construction and consolidate the best, regular, and democratic foundation of Poland.

There is no stage in our policy that harms the foundation of the socialist system, and there will never be. (Applause) We only realize our socialist program in stages. This is a program that is in line with the interests of all working people, and it is the only program for Poland's life and development. (Applause) Whoever opposes this puts himself on the other side of the line. We do not intend to draw lines among the Polish people, and this is not the purpose of our policy. But we realize that in Polish social opinion, there are various reactionary forces that represent the class interests of the bourgeoisie and capital that exist and are active. These forces will certainly not help us improve political and social life and help us build socialism, but will only do everything possible to hinder us. We even have evidence of this activity.

All kinds of anti-socialist and anti-democratic elements and scum are trying to come out in the broad wave of democratization of our lives. These social scum provoked disturbances in Bydgoszcz, burned houses, and attempted to destroy certain public buildings. The public security personnel who came forward to mediate were resisted.

We will carry out a ruthless and resolute struggle against those provocateurs, scum, and all those who disrupt public order and engage in lynching. (Applause) The organizers of the Bydgoszcz incident will be punished as they deserve by the court. Let those who commit crimes not expect to escape the law.

In the wave of criticizing past mistakes and fairly demanding accountability, attacks are often launched against all those who have been actively involved and worked in various positions in the party, government, and economy for a long time, saying that they are so-called "Stalinists." However, the vast majority of these activists worked diligently at the time, spared no effort for the people's Poland, and are now actively helping to realize the party's new political line.

These attacks are often not directed at the bureaucrats and those who are truly responsible for the bad things, but at the party and the people's regime. We cannot allow the slander and insults of honest people who are loyal to the cause of socialism. (Applause)

It can also be pointed out that another form of activity of various insidious politicians who are counting on the so-called second stage. This form is expressed in the fact that they seem to agree unconditionally with the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session and the program of various changes, but they are only devoted to the so-called democratic freedom, political independence, and how to open the door to obtaining positions. However, they do not say a word about the other aspects of the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session, such as our economic situation, the need for citizens to fulfill their obligations to the state, such as completing the obligation of compulsory sales in rural areas, methods of increasing national economic production, the need for internal peace and civic discipline, and the significance and necessity of the Polish-Soviet alliance.

They pay no attention to and remain silent on all these issues. These insidious politicians are primarily the disciples of Mr. Mikołajczyk, who is famous for defending Poland's sovereignty through espionage. (Applause) Our party is not prepared to hinder anyone who opposed socialism in the past from jointly realizing our program of democratization of social life, political life, and economic life. Even those who supported Mikołajczyk in the past can participate in and actively complete this cause. There is only one question: Are their views and political intentions today still those views and political intentions of the past? If anyone still maintains these old things, he is probably hypocritically pretending to support our program. We might as well ask all those who disagree with us a principled question: What is your road? You must know that nonsense cannot be used as a program.

We say clearly and simply: What we are building in Poland is a socialist system without deviations and distortions. We are creating broad conditions for workers to participate in the management of all state-owned enterprises. We give farmers the freedom to choose their operating methods. We believe that the collective operating method is a more advanced and superior method than individual operation. Therefore, we support any form of cooperation in the countryside and will help the development of cooperation. We have created conditions for technical intellectuals and scientific workers to give full play to their creative ideas that never existed in the old Poland. We have eliminated all obstacles to the free development of handicrafts. We even create conditions for private initiative in the building materials production sector and even other sectors.

We create socialist forms with our own strength, making them suitable for our conditions. We have enough strength to do this, and we will do it.

In terms of foreign policy, we first cooperate with socialist countries, because we ourselves are building socialism at home. The reason why we particularly emphasize friendship and alliance with the Soviet Union is not only because we are united by common socialist ideas but also because we believe that this is the foundation for guaranteeing our country's security. We cannot guarantee the security of our borders by our own strength alone.

We are fighting for peace and for the peaceful coexistence and cooperation of all countries in the world. (Applause) In short, this is our program. Whoever has other better and more realistic programs, please put them forward to the people.

No Freedom of Activity for Bourgeois Political Parties

Politicians without a program may answer us that your program does not include our demand for freedom for all political parties. Indeed, this is not included in our program. The reason for this deficiency is very simple. Giving freedom to all political parties also means giving freedom to bourgeois political parties. At this point, we raise another question: What is the program of these bourgeois political parties—our political enemies—who are striving for freedom of activity for them? Do our political enemies think that we will believe them if they tell us that the bourgeois political parties hope to build socialism in Poland? (Laughter, applause) This is like a lover found in a closet explaining to the owner that he is waiting for a streetcar there. (Laughter, applause) In a word, the only thing that can oppose our program is the program of capitalist restoration, and our political enemies do not have the courage to explain this to the people. The program of capitalist restoration will not only be resolutely rejected by the working class but will not be accepted by all working people.

Those who support capitalist restoration in Poland are encouraged by foreign imperialist centers. Poland is of great significance to these centers, and they do not care at all about the fate of our country. In history, Polish territory has more than once become a passage for the eastward march from the West. In 1939, the bourgeois political parties that ruled the country wanted to lead Poland on the road to destruction and were unwilling to cooperate with the Soviet Union to resist Hitler's aggression. At that time, Polish territory again became a broad avenue for Hitler's troops to advance eastward. Even now, in the political plans of revisionist groups that advocate re-militarization and various people who advocate establishing peace through war, the slogan "eastward march" has not died.

The imperialists will never object to turning Poland into an anti-Soviet base, so that political forces hostile to the Soviet Union can resume activities on the Polish-Soviet border. But the price to be paid for this conspiracy is the Polish people.

For our own national, national, social, and socialist interests, Poland must always firmly and relentlessly oppose all attempts to turn Polish territory into a military passage for the "eastward march" by voluntary or forced means, because if that were the case, Poland itself would have to pay a great price.

Those who advocate freedom for all political parties criticize us for not stipulating such freedom in our program. Then, are they going to suggest that we change Poland's political and geographical location, move Poland to another place on Earth, or move it to other planets? Let's leave this to them. (Laughter, applause)

No one can come up with another realistic program to compete with our program. A free, independent, and autonomous Poland can only be a socialist Poland, only the Polish People's Republic. (Applause) Only such a Poland can exist, develop, accumulate strength, democratize its relations, guarantee the people broad freedom, guarantee the people's work and peace, and guarantee the prospect of continuous improvement in people's welfare.

Another Poland is impossible, that is, there can be no other program than the program put forward by our party. We have proven through practice in recent weeks that the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session are not empty words. We immediately began to implement these resolutions.

Strengthening the Cooperation of Various Democratic Parties

Recently, due to the initiative proposed by our party in accordance with the agreements reached with the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party, the Central Consultative Committee of Various Political Parties was established. Under the influence of the changes that took place in our party in October, the process of democratization has affected all political parties and social groups in Poland. Members who had been passive in the past spoke out, expressed their opinions publicly, and elected people they trusted to the organs of their groups.

In this case, cooperation between political parties and social groups has a new content. Therefore, the formation of consultative committees at all levels across the country is a new step on the road to the democratization of national life.

The Central Consultative Committee decided to establish consultative bodies in various provinces and counties. The activities of these committees will mainly focus on the election and election period of the new parliament. The establishment of consultative committees of various political parties is not only for it to play a role in the elections but also a permanent consultative body between various political parties. Its task is to strengthen mutual cooperation between various political parties, organize domestic political life, solve various economic and social problems, mobilize its members, and mobilize the people of the country through them to complete the common program of socialist construction in Poland. (Applause)

The difference between Poland's path to socialism and the socialist construction methods of other countries also lies in the fact that it takes as its basis the cooperation of socialist construction with other non-socialist, non-Marxist parties that support socialism. This cooperation is possible because the most important content of socialism, that is, changing social relations by eliminating human exploitation, is in line with the wishes of these parties.

This main joining point between our party, which is based on the principles of scientific socialism as its basis for activity, and the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party, which do not recognize these principles in philosophical terms, is eliminating the adversarial contradictions between us and is becoming the basis for mutual cooperation. (Applause)

The progressive Catholic Church can also participate in the cause of building a system of social justice—the socialist system. (Applause) Recently, we have created broad possibilities for the public activities of this church.

Now Cardinal Wyszyński's church duties have been restored, and the party and government have taken many other measures to confirm their sincerity. In addition to this, we are also prepared to fully resolve all other issues that have not been fully resolved until now for the people's country, the Catholic Church, and its believers. These issues are the subject of negotiations between representatives of the current government and representatives of the church. (Applause) We hope to create conditions in this regard as well to eliminate the friction between the church and the state. In the long history of the Polish state, such friction has been countless and quite acute.

We believe that the entire hierarchy and all monks, after obtaining complete freedom of religious activity, will not use this freedom to realize purposes that have nothing in common with religion. We believe that their own position will support the people's regime and will permanently pay attention to the interests of the motherland, the national interests of the people's country, and the interests of the nation.

In order to consolidate our common motherland—the people's Poland—we will also seek what can unite us with progressive Catholics, rather than what divides us from them. We have always emphasized that the democratic development of all aspects of people's lives is carried out within the scope of socialist democracy. But this scope is by no means fixed once it is determined, that is, this scope is not immutable. We are convinced that the time will always come when socialism no longer has any scope that restricts the freedom of activity of every person. The basis of our conviction is that the idea of socialism is to express the most heartfelt wishes and interests of all working people.

Today, this scope is necessary. This necessity arises from the domestic and foreign class conditions that surround us. History teaches

### 只有社会主义的波兰才能是独立自主的波兰  波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡十一月二十九日在全波积极分子会议上的讲话

    只有社会主义的波兰才能是独立自主的波兰
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡十一月二十九日在全波积极分子会议上的讲话亲爱的同志们，公民们！
    在人民的生活当中有这样一些日子，这些日子像疆界标志一样把人民生活的一个时期同另一个时期划分了开来。可以有把握地说，在十分紧张的10月里举行的波兰统一工人党中央委员会全体会议的日子，就是属于这样的日子。
    今天，当波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议（在这次会上通过了引起全体人民生活转变的决议）结束以来还只有几星期的时候，当然不能说，八中全会的一切决议都已经执行了，因为在八中全会上拟定的是革新我们政治和经济生活的广泛的纲领。
    实现八中全会决议中宣布的许多原则需要许多年的时间。要达到已提出的目标，道路是漫长而艰巨的。这条道路并不永远是轻松和平坦的。八中全会规定的行动纲领要求我国千百万公民创造性地、紧张地努力工作，首先要求全体人民自觉、镇定和有耐心。
    波苏关系正常化是共同事业的胜利
    虽然我们还只是站在新道路的开端，然而自八中全会以来的短短时期内，在八中全会决议中占第一位的、波兰人民的主要的和原则性的要求之一已经实现了。
    我们说过，我们看到波苏关系中存在的某些不正常现象的原因是什么。在世界上很难找到一个像波兰民族这样敏感地对待自己的独立和主权的民族。这种敏感性是我们人民的历史发展的产物。波兰国家十个世纪的悲剧和被邻国侵略者瓜分的波兰民族世世代代遭受的奴役，在我们民族心理中加深了对自己国家的独立和主权问题的特殊敏感性，这种敏感性是其他长期以来就是独立的民族所不能了解的。
    在战后的波苏友好关系中有着一些刺激波兰人民的事实。其中包括这样一些问题：在从苏联遣返波兰人的工作方面产生困难和拖延，缺乏详细规定苏军暂时驻留波兰境内的法规，波兰以特别价格供应苏联以煤的问题以及其他或多或少重要的问题。国内外敌视波兰人民政权的敌人在这些对人民和我们党说来是细小的问题上挑拨是非。他们利用这个机会进行反对苏联和反对波兰国家切身利益的造谣生事的宣传。
    照这种宣传说，我们国家中的这一切缺点和毛病，都应当由苏联负责。只要市场上感到缺少肉或油，反动宣传就在煽动，向人民说，这是因为苏联把我们的肉和油弄走了。又譬如说，供应农村的水泥的数量一直不够，于是“自由欧洲”电台的先生们就硬要农民们相信：他们买不到水泥是因为波兰把国内生产的一半数量的水泥都出售给苏联了。
    好像对波兰所发生的一切，对党和政府的政策，对生产和贸易都应当由苏联负责。
    敌视社会主义和反对人民政权的人们的政治利益，过去和现在都要求在波兰人民中广泛进行荒谬透顶的反苏宣传。可以想像，他们在听到早先在波苏关系中存在的一切不正常现象都消除了的消息时会感到多么沮丧。我们把他们进行混淆是非宣传的一个最好的把柄取掉了。
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会和波兰人民共和国政府代表团同苏共中央主席团和苏联政府代表团举行的谈判和会谈以及在联合声明中陈述的这次谈判结果，是双方的明智政策的巨大成就。
    八中全会提出的在波苏相互关系方面的要求，在今年10月30日苏联政府发表的关于社会主义国家之间所应有的关系的宣言中得到了肯定和承认。
    今年11月的波苏声明涉及波苏关系的部分只不过是再从形式上肯定一下苏联共产党和苏联政府早就承认的那些原则。在平等和尊重主权的原则上建立的波苏关系有时被认为是波兰单方面的胜利。这种估价是我们所不能接受的，因为它歪曲了这个问题的本质，而这个问题的内容是属于社会主义本质的。
    波苏关系的正常化，在平等和尊重主权的原则上建立这种关系，这是波兰和苏联双方的胜利，因为我们的共同事业胜利了，社会主义思想胜利了，社会主义思想只知道有一条法制——大小国家一律平等。
　  苏联在匈牙利事件中的正义立场
    在现在还不是统一的，而是分裂为两个相互斗争的阵营的世界上，人类命运正处在决定性的关头，天秤上这一端的法码的重量还没有重得可以使人类按照自己的衷心愿望沿着持久和平的道路前进而不被拖进可能导致人类毁灭的可怕的毁灭性的战争，在这样的世界上、在这样的情况下，遗憾的是，社会主义的法制——一切民族平等、社会主义的原则，同工人阶级国际团结思想有着不可分割的联系的原则——一国不干涉另一国内政，有时也可能被歪曲。
    我所指的是匈牙利的悲剧事件。大家知道，这次事件被一切敌视社会主义的势力利用来进行反对苏联和一些国家的共产党的疯狂运动。
    我们党已经发表过自己对这个问题的意见。我们深切感到遗憾的是，匈牙利局势发展到这样的地步，以致要根据匈牙利政府的请求在这个国家的内部斗争中使用苏联军队。然而，即使事情发展到这种干预地步，我们都很清楚，每一个人也很清楚，苏联不是在匈牙利找寻经济剥削地区，苏联并不打算从匈牙利人民的劳动中获取物质利益和把匈牙利变成自己的殖民地。
    这种干预在性质上和西方国家对埃及的军事干涉不同。对埃及的干涉不仅是反对埃及的民族主权，同时也是破产了的、给许多国家带来政治压迫和经济剥削的殖民政策的继续。
    值得我们注意的是，特别大声叫嚷反对苏联干预匈牙利事件的，恰恰就是那些把自己的政策和希望寄托在只不过是来自另一方面的外来干涉上的政治人物，这些人用他们那种说得天花乱坠的广播宣传，用他们提出的帮助进行所谓解放的诺言来煽动匈牙利的敌对分子，也就是这些人应该对匈牙利土地上所流的血负不小的责任。
    很遗憾，必须指出，匈牙利有一些人相信了这种援助的诺言。而这种“援助”应该被看成是利用匈牙利问题来发动世界大战。匈牙利人民的不幸在于党没有及时领导起满足正当要求的斗争，党没有去领导符合人民主张进行必要的社会主义改革的要求的发展过程。
      波兰的情形就不一样。因此，我们的改
  革现在和将来都是在社会主义领域内的改革，因此，大的转折是在和平而顺利的情形下完成的，因此，达到了建立在社会主义平等原则上的波苏关系的正常化。莫斯科会谈的结果和波苏声明可以作为社会主义国家之间应当有的那种关系的榜样。我们深深相信，苏匈关系也将建立在这些原则上。我们说这样的话是根据我们自己的经验，并且考虑到苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的代表们充分了解了我们在莫斯科最近会谈期间所提出的正当要求。
    苏波在经济问题上的谅解
    在这些要求中占主要地位的就是供应煤的问题，波兰是根据1945年8月16日的协定而承担义务供应这些煤的。这个协定是对波兰不利的，因为它规定要我们以很低的价格卖出一定数量的煤。这是一个异乎寻常的贸易协定。这是波兰的义务，就是用煤来补偿苏联放弃划归波兰的前德国领土上的德国财产而移交给波兰这件事。
    我不想在这里研究这个问题的法律方面。1945年波兰政府同苏联政府签订了对波兰不利的协定，这是一个事实。9月前的波兰的政府同其他国家签订的各种国际协定在某种意义上来说也是这样的协定。
    在各国之间的关系中通用这样的原则：签订条约的任何一方必须遵守条约上的一切规定，那怕是这种条约给某一方带来了严重的损失。政府可以更替，但是签订的条约仍旧不变。在讨论波兰就同苏联签订的对波兰不利的协定方面提出的要求时没有采用上述原则。
    作为社会主义国家政府的苏联政府和苏联共产党却是按另一种方式对待已签订的波苏协定的问题。这个协定对波兰不利的那一面是同在斯大林生前所形成的那种不平等关系有关的。苏联政府和苏联共产党决定彻底铲除过去一切违反社会主义原则和违背社会主义国家平等的现象，因此苏联方面接受了我们提出的有关过去时期的事情的要求。
    苏联政府在结算波兰根据1945年8月16日协定供给苏联的煤的时候，承认波兰根据世界市场的煤价所提出的要求，这项要求为数约达五亿美元，苏联政府将波兰在过去时期由于取得各种贷款而积欠苏联的债务中相应地减除了这一笔数目。
    附带应当提到，战前外国资本家从我们的国民经济中取得了大量的利润和股息。从来没有人要求归还波兰工人所创造的这些利润。原本可以建议那些形形式式的“复兴派”政治家们来解决这个问题，他们对波兰现在的主权如此敏感，可是当他们自己统治波兰时，他们却不愿意知道和看见波兰国家主权受到剥削我们经济的外国资本家破坏这一个事实。资本家永远不会将他们拿走了的而理应属于波兰人民的东西归还给波兰人民。否则他们就不成其为资本家了。
    而苏联却承认了我们公平的要求，它不问波兰政府过去承担的条约义务，还给我们在已供给的煤方面的差价。（鼓掌）这个事实不能仅仅看为狭隘的财政范围内的事情。在估价波苏关系方面发生的变化、估价由于社会主义精神和社会主义国家内部关系以及社会主义国家在国家之间和党之间关系方面曾经产生的偏差被消除而发生的变化时，这个事实的意义就特别有力。
    苏联政府也同意共同研究和肯定我们对经过波兰国家铁路上的过境货运的要求。这方面指的是过去曾经一度按压低的运费付款的货运。
    双方将共同研究和决定我们其他一些细小要求，如关于暂时驻留我国境内的苏联军队使用我们的交通设备的问题。波兰除了以赊买方式所得到的谷物、以及用以支付货物的为数七亿卢布的新贷款之外，苏联还同意取消波兰在1947年接受的所谓剩余军事物资贷款所欠下的大约一亿一千万卢布的债务。这个数目相等于波兰至今还未偿还这笔贷款的剩余部分，它也包括在波兰从苏联得到的超过二十一亿卢布的贷款总数之中。
    西方所谓援助的真相
    说到这里我也想指出一点，在战后波兰也从美国得到大约三千八百万美元的所谓剩余军事物资贷款，我们用这笔贷款购买了美国军队复员后留下来的汽车及其他物资。用这些钱购买来的装备早就损毁了，但是波兰至今为偿还这个债务每年要付出一百三十万美元本金，和用黄金支付约七万美元的利息。
    波兰政府还承担着波兰流亡政府向英国欠下的、用以维持在战争期间的波兰行政机关、学校和国外波兰难民的所谓战时债务。
    不论是“剩余军事物资贷款”，不论是战时债务，当然都给我们的收支平衡增加负担。我所以提起这件事，是因为外国的宣传在波兰的某些人士中制造了这样的看法：似乎以美国为首的西方国家准备给波兰以重大帮助，而波兰政府则反对这种援助。对于这个问题波兰政府已经公开地发表过声明。上面所举的波兰欠美国、英国债务的二个例子，也许可以作为外国广播电台宣传援助波兰的具体的好题目。如果这样，那就请首先提出取消波兰国家上述债务的要求。（鼓掌）
　　苏军驻波是和平和波兰安全的保证
    党中央委员会和波兰政府代表团还解决了波兰人民所关心的波兰人从苏联遣返回国的问题。（掌声）苏共和苏联政府代表在这个问题上不加讨论就同意了波兰代表团的立场。双方通过了一项原则：遣返范围应当包括被分开的家庭，即包括那些在波兰有亲属的人和由于不得已的原因、例如生病、军役、居留集中营或者是被放逐等原因而不能在1945—1947年遣返的人。
    苏联政府还同意遣返那些服刑的波兰人。遣返办法或者是提前释放，或者是把他们移交给波兰当局。遣返问题将由双方缔结专门的波苏协定来加以确定，由于缺乏这种协定，一直到现在妨碍遣返的速度。
    双方还拟定了规定临时驻扎波兰西部边境的苏联军队的地位的基本原则。关于苏联军队临时驻扎波兰的问题是同整个的国际局势、我们西部边境的安全、苏联和一切人民民主国家的安全有着不可分割的联系，特别是同西德的重新军国主义化、外国军队在德国领土上驻留以及某些西方国家参加大西洋联盟有着不可分割的联系。
    党和行使国家政权的人、特别是波兰统一工人党和它的领导机构，对国家的政策、对人民和国家的命运负有重大的责任。任何错误的政治措施、任何未经深思熟虑的决定都会给全国人民招致无穷尽的危害。无论是我们和我们的人民一分钟也不能忘记，西方国家直到现在都不承认我们的奥得—尼斯边界，德意志联邦共和国复仇主义集团不想放弃改变我们西部边界的修正主义计划和阴谋，甚至那些把自己列入民主党和工人党的德国党派，直到现在也没有采取反对修正主义的立场。
    我们应该永远记得1939年的九月悲剧。凡是经历过这个悲剧和记得这个悲剧的人，就应当关心我们国家的安全、我们边界的完整和不可侵犯性。
    波苏联盟对当前和未来的波兰是关键性的问题。我们再一次郑重声明，只要对外关系的情况不足以保障我们国家的安全和完整，我们就将认为一定数量的苏军部队驻留波兰是适宜的。（鼓掌）
    加强社会主义国家的团结
    至于谈到各国之间的关系，那么我们同社会主义阵营的联盟和我们在社会主义世界的地位就是我们主权的基础和决定我们在世界上的地位的东西。在这条道路上，我们已经向前迈进了一大步。我们党主动地设法消除波苏关系中所存在的一切足以妨碍这种关系的改善、并且与社会主义基本原则不相符的东西，党今天可以告诉全体人民，这个任务已经完成了。
    依照第八次全体会议的决议和苏联政府在今年10月30日所发表的宣言，波兰人民共和国和苏联两国之间的相互关系建立在双方完全平等，尊重领土完整、国家独立和主权以及不干涉内政的原则的基础上。（鼓掌）
    这个重大的事件在波苏关系中打开了新的一页，同时也是国际社会主义中的新的一页。日益紧密亲近的友好、合作和相互了解的关系把我们同另一个强大的社会主义国家——中华人民共和国团结在一起。同人民中国的亲密关系总共只有七年历史，但是这一段比较短的时间彻底证明，中华人民共和国是我们经过考验的好朋友。（鼓掌）
    中国政府关于社会主义国家之间关系问题的声明以及其他许多主张是同我们党的观点完全吻合的，中国的这些主张是在中国的社会主义道路上成功地发展的、中国共产党的马克思列宁主义的独立创造的成就。
    亲密的友好关系和最切身相关的共同利益把我们同捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和其他人民民主国家团结在一起。同南斯拉夫的关系也是这样。我们同南斯拉夫的关系不仅已经正常化；而且完全消除了在以往的岁月中那些曾经分裂过我们两个国家的东西。
    并不是所有的共产党和工人党对波兰的变化的意义和我们党的政策都有一致的看法。我们认为，这是不足为奇的。我们相信，我国事件的发展将证实在我们的条件下我们所走的道路是正确的，毫无疑问，我们也将对整个工人运动的经验作出贡献。我们热烈要求，世界各国之间的关系建筑在友好和和平的基础上。波兰希望促进这一点。
    凡是明白使用原子武器和热核子武器的可怕后果的人，决不会主张用战争来解决世界各国之间的争端和矛盾。我们将不遗余力地为改善同一切国家（只要它们也有这个愿望）的关系以及同这些国家建立经济和文化合作而努力。
    我们也愿意同世界各国讨论同双方有关的政治问题，来求得这样的解决办法，这种解决办法要能在某种程度上有助于国际紧张局势的缓和，有助于在各种争端上使彼此的看法接近，促进和平共处的原则的胜利，促进国际经济和文化交流的发展。
    党犯过错误，但成绩是主要的
    第八次全体会议在消除社会主义制度中的偏差和异己的渣滓的范围内使社会和政治生活民主化方面所提出的任务以及包括全部经济问题的任务（其目的是要形成适合于我国条件的特有的社会主义形式）还仅处于实现过程中的第一个阶段。
    今天对上述问题作出初步结论虽然还为时尚早，但是根据过去几周中自己的和别人的经验，还是可以谈谈这个题目。
    先谈谈我们的党。我们不打算、而且也不应当把波兰统一工人党工作中的任何错误、偏差以及它们的后果缩小。我们不愿意、也不应当把过去的坏的一面都归罪于我们党进行工作的客观条件。
    波兰统一工人党在工作中犯过错误。波兰统一工人党在某些问题上并不总是对的，它的政治路线并不总是正确的，然而有一件重大的功绩使它无愧于工人党这一称号，这就是恰是党员群众、首先是党的中央领导人员当着全体人民对这种错误进行了尖锐、无情的批评。
    这种批评在党内、在党的积极分子队伍中产生出来，在中央委员会的几次全体会议上展开，终于在中央委员会第八次全体会议上对党的政治路线和领导机构的成员作了必要的改变。我们党毫不犹豫地把这种极大耻辱的原因原原本本地告诉了人民，虽然真情往往是于自己的党员不利的。
    没有一个党，没有一个人能够在实践中不犯错误，因为这是没有法子办得到的。但是很少有过这样的人，在我们党的历史中更难找到这样的人：他们认为自己有义务不仅把自己活动中好的方面告诉人民，而且也要报告坏的方面，并且有勇气这样做。要敢于走这一步，必须要对自己所说的话，对自己所执行的政策，有重大的责任感。对我们党的坏的一面的批评来自我们自己的队伍这一事实，使我们有权利向那些只看见我们党的错误而不愿看到其他东西的人提出这样的问题：为什么他们从来也没有具备我们这样的勇敢精神？为什么他们从来也没有把他们在对人民和波兰国家的命运负责或局部负责的各个时期所犯的许多后果更严重和悲惨得多的错误告诉人民？（鼓掌）
    我们要问：哪一个党曾经承认自己对波兰在1939年9月的崩溃负有责任？（鼓掌）哪一个党曾经有勇气告诉人民，华沙起义——对这件事负有责任的不是一个党，而这次起义使华沙居民血流成河，使波兰首都变成一片废墟——是后果悲惨的轻举妄动，是不能原谅的政治错误。哪一个多年来支持沙那茨政权和波兰反动派的反苏政策的党曾经承认，从国家和波兰人民的切身利益的角度来看，这种政策是有害的，并且给波兰造成了无数危害。要知道，由于这些错误，由于这种错误所由产生的反动政策，波兰人民付出的代价是落入希特勒的控制之下，付出了数以百万计的生命，在经济上遭受了巨大的损失。
    华沙还有成千成万人住简陋的小屋，住地下室，住顶楼，或是狭窄的公寓。他们以及人民政权的肩上沉重地压着那些多年以来统治着人民的人的虚伪、有害政策的遗产。
    对于这一切难道没有人负有责任吗？难道这一切是什么不可避免的历史必要吗？今天有人向我们党扔石头，看到我们眼睛里的灰尘，而看不到自己眼中的砂子，这种人有什么道义权利可以这样做呢？（鼓掌）
    错误不足以说明我们党的政策，足以说明的是国家从战争的废墟和经济衰落中复兴起来这一事实。在经济政策方面所犯的错误，不至于掩蔽生产力的蓬勃发展、我们工业的发展和国民收入的不断增加。尽管我们现在在经济上经受种种困难，我国经济发展的前景是令人满意的。一两棵树遮蔽不了森林。谁只看到我们党的活动中的错误，那就是什么也没有看到。正是那些什么也没有看到或是不愿看到的人，才认为我们党的八中全会所宣布的争取人民全部生活民主化的新政治路线应当最后恢复资产阶级民主。
    绝不容许资本主义复辟
    八中全会的决议虽然也得到这些人的殷勤支持，然而这些决议对他们来说只不过是一个过渡阶段，在这个阶段之后应当会有另外一个阶段来到。但是，他们不能清楚看到，究竟在第二个阶段要发生些什么，如果不是恢复战前旧的地主资本家的关系的话。因此，我们必须打消这些阶段论政客们、即资产阶级政客们的一切妄想，不管他们是在怎样的幌子底下活动。（鼓掌）
    波兰统一工人党以全力打击过去时期内歪曲社会主义思想的偏差和错误，并不是要使资本主义关系在国内复辟。党对过去不好方面的批评，是为了巩固社会主义建设，巩固波兰最好的，经常的和民主的基础。
    我们的政策中没有任何损害社会主义制度基础的阶段，将来也不会有的。（鼓掌）我们只有分阶段来实现我们的社会主义纲领，这是符合所有劳动人民利益的纲领，也是波兰生活与发展唯一的纲领。（鼓掌）谁反对这样做，谁就使自己站在界线的另一边。我们不打算在波兰人民中划分界线，这也不是我们的政策的目的。可是我们意识到，在波兰的社会舆论中有各种代表资产阶级和资本的阶级利益的反动力量存在和活动着。这些力量肯定不会帮助我们改善政治和社会生活，帮助我们建设社会主义，而只会用尽一切方法来妨碍我们。我们甚至有这种活动的证据。
    形形色色的敌视社会主义与民主的分子和败类企图在我们生活民主化的广阔浪潮中出头露面。这些社会败类在比得哥熙挑衅滋事，焚毁住宅，企图破坏某些公共建筑物。出面调处的治安人员遭到抗拒。
    我们对那些挑衅分子，败类和所有破坏公共秩序、行私刑的人，将进行无情的和坚决的斗争。（鼓掌）比得哥熙事件的组织人会受到法院判处的应有的惩罚。让那些犯罪的人不要指望能够逍遥法外。
    在批评过去的错误和公正地要求追究责任的浪潮中，往往对过去长期在党、政府和经济的各种岗位上积极活动和工作的所有的人进行攻击，说他们是所谓“斯大林主义分子”，但是这些活动分子绝大部分当时都是勤勤恳恳地工作，为了人民的波兰曾不惜自己的力量，而现在又积极帮助实现党的新政治路线。
    这些攻击常常不是指向官僚主义者和坏事的真正责任人，而是指向党和人民政权。我们不能容许诬蔑和侮辱正直、忠于社会主义事业的人。（鼓掌）
    也可以指出各式各样指望所谓第二阶段来到的阴险政客们的另一种活动形式。这种形式表现在，他们在口头上似乎无条件地同意八中全会的决议、同意各种变革的纲领，但是他们所专心致志的仅是所谓民主自由、政治独立、是怎样才可以打开取得职位的大门。而关于八中全会决议的另一方面、即关于我们的经济情况、关于公民对国家履行自己义务的必要性，例如农村完成义务缴售、关于增加国民经济生产的方法、关于内部安宁和公民纪律的必要性、关于波苏联盟的意义和必要性他们却只字不提。
    他们对所有这些问题都不加注意和缄口不谈。这些阴险政客首先是著名的以进行特务活动方式来保卫波兰主权的米科拉兹柯先生的门生。（掌声）我们的党不准备阻挠任何一个过去反对社会主义的人来共同实现我们的社会生活、政治和经济生活民主化的纲领。就是过去拥护米科拉兹柯的人也可以参加和积极地完成这一事业。问题只有一个，他们今天的观点和政治意向是否还是以前的那些观点和政治图谋。谁如果还保持着这些旧东西，他大概是在口是心非地假说支持我们的纲领。不妨向所有不同意我们的人提出一个原则问题：你们的道路是怎么样的？要知道，无稽之谈是不能作为纲领的。
    我们明确简单地说：我们在波兰建立的是没有偏差和歪曲的社会主义制度。我们在为工人创造广泛的条件，使他们能够参加管理全民所有的企业。我们给农民选择经营方式的自由。我们认为集体经营的方式是比个体经营更高级更优越的方式。因此，我们支持乡村中任何形式的合作，并且将帮助合作的发展。我们为技术知识分子和科学工作人员创造了在旧波兰从来不曾有过的发挥创造思想的条件。我们消除了手工业自由发展道路上的一切障碍。我们甚至在建筑材料生产部门甚至其他部门创造发挥私人主动性的条件。
    我们用自己的力量创造社会主义形式，使它适合我们的条件。我们有足够力量这样作，我们会作到这点。
    在外交政策方面，我们首先同社会主义国家合作，因为我们自己在国内建设社会主义。我们所以特别着重同苏联的友好和联盟，不仅是因为有共同的社会主义思想团结着我们，而且因为我们认为这是保证我国安全的基础。光靠自己的力量我们不能保证国境的安全。
    我们在为和平、为世界各国和平共处和合作而斗争。（掌声）简单说来，我们的纲领就是这样。谁有其他更好的、更现实的纲领，就请他向人民提出来。
    不给资产阶级政党活动自由
    没有纲领的政治家们可能回答我们说，你们的纲领中没有列入我们对一切政党应有自由的要求。的确，我们纲领中没有这一点。这一点不足的原因非常简单。给一切政党自由也就意味着给资产阶级政党自由。在这个地方我们再次提出一个问题：这些资产阶级政党——我们的政治敌人在为它们争取活动自由——有怎样的纲领呢？我们的政治敌人是不是以为，他们向我们说资产阶级政党希望在波兰建设社会主义，我们就会相信他们。（笑声、掌声）这好比：一个在衣橱里被发现的情人向主人解释他是在那里等电车。（笑声、掌声）一句话，可以同我们的纲领对立的只是资本主义复辟的纲领，而我们的政治敌人没有勇气向人民说明这点。资本主义复辟的纲领不仅会遭到工人阶级的坚决拒绝，而且不会被全体劳动人民所接受的。
    波兰拥护资本主义复辟的人从外国帝国主义中心得到鼓舞。对这些中心来说，波兰有重大的意义，而我们国家的命运如何，他们是根本不顾的。在历史上，波兰的土地不只一次地成为从西方向东方进军的过道。在1939年，统治着国家的资产阶级政党想把波兰引上毁灭的道路，不愿意同苏联合作去抵御希特勒的侵略。当时，波兰的土地又成了希特勒军队往东进军的宽阔大道。直到现在，在主张重新军国主义化的修正主义集团中，在各种各样主张通过战争树立和平的人的政治打算中，“东进”的口号还没有死亡。
    帝国主义者决不反对把波兰变为反苏基地，使敌视苏联的政治势力在波苏边境重新活动。可是要对这种阴谋付出代价的却是波兰人民。
    为了我们自己的、民族的、国家的和社会主义的利益，波兰必须始终坚决无情地反对各种想通过自愿或强迫方式变波兰领土为军事“东进”的过道的企图，因为果真那样，波兰自己就不得不付出很大的代价。
    那些主张给一切政治党派自由的人批评我们，说我们在纲领中没有规定这种自由，那么他们是不是要建议我们把波兰的政治地理位置加以改变，把波兰搬到地球上另外一个地方去，或者搬到其他的星球上去呢？我们把这个留给他们来干吧。（笑声，掌声）
    没有人能拿出别的现实纲领来同我们的纲领相抗衡。自由、独立和自主的波兰只能是社会主义的波兰，只能是波兰人民共和国。（掌声）只有这样的波兰才能够存在、发展、积聚力量、使自己的关系民主化，保障人民有广泛自由，保证人民的工作与和平，保证能有人民福利不断提高的远景。
    不可能存在另外一个波兰，也就是说除了我们党提出来的纲领以外不可能有别的纲领。我们通过最近几周的实践证明，八中全会的决议不是空话。我们是立刻就开始实现这些决议的。
    加强各民主党派的合作
    最近，由于我们党根据同统一农民党和民主党所达成的协议而提出的倡议，成立了各政治党派中央协商委员会。在我们党内10月所发生的变化的影响下，民主化的过程波及了波兰的所有政党和一切社会团体。过去一直是消极的成员发言了，他们公开表示自己的意见，把他们所信任的人选到自己团体的机构中去。
    在这种情况下，各政党和社会团体间的合作就有了新的内容。因此全国各级协商委员会的组成就是国家生活民主化的道路上的一个新的步骤。
      中央协商委员会决定在各省和各县中成立协商机构。这些委员会的活动主要将集中在新议会的竞选和选举时期中。各政党协商委员会的设立不仅是为了让它在选举时起作用，而且也是各政党间常设的协商机构。它的任务是：加强各政党的相互合作，组织国内政治生活，解决各种经济和社会问题，动员自己的成员，并且通过他们动员全国人民去完成波兰社会主义建设的共同纲领。（掌声）
  波兰走向社会主义的道路与其他国家的社会主义建设方法的区别还在于：它把同其他非社会主义的、非马克思主义的、然而是支持社会主义的政党在社会主义建设中的合作作为基础。这种合作是可能的，因为社会主义最重要的内容，也就是通过消灭人对人的剥削改变社会关系，是符合这些党派的愿望的。
    我们这个以科学的社会主义原则为活动基础的党同不承认这些原则的哲学方面的统一农民党和民主党之间的这一主要接合点，正在消除我们之间的对抗矛盾，并且成了相互合作的基础。（掌声）
    进步天主教会也可以参加建设社会正义制度——社会主义制度的事业。（掌声）近来我们为这一教会的公开活动创造了广泛的可能性。
    现在已恢复了维欣斯基红衣主教的教会职务，党和政府还采取了其他许多措施证实自己的诚意，除此之外我们还准备为人民国家、天主教会和它的信徒圆满解决直到现在还没有彻底解决的一切其他问题，这些问题是目前政府代表和教会代表谈判中讨论的对象。（掌声）我们希望在这方面也创造条件，以消除教会和国家间的磨擦，在波兰国家漫长的历史上这样的磨擦是不计其数和相当尖锐的。
    我们相信，整个教阶和所有僧侣在获得宗教活动的完全自由后，不会利用这种自由来实现同宗教毫无相同之处的目的，我们相信他们自己的立场会支持人民政权，并且将永久注意到祖国和人民的国家利益和民族利益。
    为了巩固我们大家的祖国——人民波兰，我们还将寻求能把我们同进步的天主教徒团结在一起的东西，而不是把我们同他们分割开来的东西。我们一直强调，人民生活各方面的民主化发展在社会主义民主的范围内进行。但是这种范围绝不是一经确定就永远如此的，也就是说，这种范围并不是不可改变的。我们深信，社会主义不再有任何限制每一个人的活动自由的范围的时候总会到来，我们的这种信念的根据是，社会主义的思想是表达全体劳动人民的最衷心的愿望和利益的。
    今天，这种范围是有必要的，这种必要性从包围我们的国内外的阶级条件产生。历史教导我们，在阶级社会的条件下，给予各种主要的社会力量以广泛的民主和自由，将会导致消灭民主和自由，产生法西斯专政。意大利的法西斯主义和德国的希特勒独裁就是雄辩的例证。我们党八中全会所实行的民主化范围能够不断扩大，只要是民主不被资产阶级的和反动的势力和倾向利用来破坏和削弱社会主义和人民政权的基础。
    国内的和平和秩序、彼此合作的各政党的大规模创造性工作、各个社会团体和各种组织创造性地参加执行波兰可能有的同一纲领，即建成社会主义的纲领，将有利于扩大我国社会主义民主的范围。而情况相反，那就必须缩小这种范围，采取保卫我们的制度和人民政权的手段。
    换句话说，民主自由的范围取决于随着我国社会主义建设而产生的条件。
      应该更加重视经济问题
      同国内广泛的政治生活紧密地联系着的重大问题，首先是我国经济生活不够发展，也就是要增加工农业生产。必须遗憾地指出，无论是报刊，或是政党以及许多社会团体直到现在都还对这个问题注意得太少。到处还是把政治问题看得比经济问题重。
    甚至有这样的人：他们以为，他们越是多谈和多写自由和民主的问题，国家也就越加一帆风顺。同志们，一方面享有广泛的自由和民主，同时却流落街头或者饿死，这是可能的。
    波兰工人阶级知道这样的民主，并且毫不怜惜它。尽管废除了波兰欠苏联的债务，尽管获得了新的贷款，波兰的经济情况部分还是困难的。
    特别是，1957年将是市场上商品不能满足人民购买力的一年。因此，需要使人民的全付精力首先放在生产大量商品上。大大削减煤的出口将使我们的收支差额中产生漏洞。在现在的经济情况下是无法堵塞这个漏洞的。根据上述种种原因，在我们的报刊和宣传中经济问题应当比政治问题占更重要的地位。这将是整个工人阶级和全体人民所期望于我们的最好的政策（掌声）。
    把热心社会主义的人选进议会
    今天我们这个全波大会，是议会选举即将来临的时候举行的。虽然，直到现在我一句也还没有谈到选举的事情，但是，我方才说过的那些话，都是我们党的选举前的主张。（掌声）我们的选举要求都包括在共同制定的全国统一阵线的纲领性宣告中了。我们联合其他的民主党派一起进行选举，并且将在全国统一阵线的共同候选人名单中提出候选人。
    反对社会主义的人说，共同候选人名单是缺乏民主的标志。我记得，在旧波兰进行选举的时候，为了争夺议席，大约提出了二十七张，甚至更多的竞选名单，也就是说有这么多各式各样的党派和团体参加竞选。可能认为，那是一种理想的民主。然而，谁都记得，在这种理想的民主下，共产党是不能公开活动的，监狱里关满了共产党员；劳动人民的示威游行被用警察和骑兵队、甚至不止一次地受到扫射的镇压和驱散。
      由此可见，那时的民主不是对任何人都一视同仁的。但是，即使这些甚至也可以不算是什么很重要的。
    最重要的是：有二十七个党派争夺议席的那种理想的民主究竟给波兰带来了什么，给了人民什么？波兰没有因为那时把它弄得四分五裂的许多政党而强大起来。相反，波兰丧失了自己的力量。这些政党既没有给波兰人民面包，也没有给他们工作。波兰在战前，甚至在经济最繁荣的时期，许多重要工业产品的生产和大多数农作物的收成都没有达到1913年的水平。城乡各地失业现象普遍。如果有人愿意把昨天的波兰和现在的波兰很好地作一比较，那他不妨统计一下1939年9月以前波兰生活的二十年中建立的工厂、科学机关、高等学校等等一类机关和人民波兰成立以来的十二年中所建立的这一类机关。我认为应当作这样的对比。这是很有裨益的，特别是对于反对人民波兰的人，即维护二十七个政党的民主的人来说。
    如果有人认为，目前波兰人民中的议员候选人没有战前那么多，那他就大错特错了。根据从全国各地来的消息，有些选区，居民本来应当只选出三名到六名议员，然而他们却提出了数十名，甚至数百名议员。我们看到，波兰政权机关的候选人从来没有缺额过的。（笑声）因为有这样大批的议员候选人，由各政党、社会团体以及各省和县全国阵线委员会委员代表组成的全国统一阵线区选举委员会要选出一些最好的和最成熟的人来履行波兰人民共和国议会议员的职务，而他们的名字就将被列入全国统一阵线候选人名单。
    那些在选举中得到多数票的候选人将当选为议会议员。选民应当知道，未来的议会的工作作得好坏，在不小的程度上将取决于那些将作为人民的代表而在议会开会的人的品质。坐在议员席位上——这不仅是荣誉，这首先是每个议员对选民和人民国家承担的巨大责任。
    我们的党号召选民：从议员候选人中选出这样一些人，他们具有最深切的社会责任感，他们能把自己的知识水平和这样一种愿望结合起来，这种愿望就是：用自己的知识为人民服务，为社会主义建设服务，即为社会正义的制度服务，为波兰人民共和国服务。波兰统一工人党将提出这样的议员候选人。（掌声）
