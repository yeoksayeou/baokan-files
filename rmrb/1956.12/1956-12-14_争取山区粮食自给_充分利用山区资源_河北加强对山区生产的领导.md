Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, December 12th: Hebei Province recently held a mountainous area work conference to study specific measures for leading people in mountainous areas to strive for food self-sufficiency and develop diversified operations.

The meeting believed that the mountainous areas of Hebei Province have very advantageous natural conditions; most mountainous areas are also old revolutionary base areas, and the level of mass consciousness is relatively high; advanced agricultural cooperatives have been realized. Among the province's fifty-two mountainous and semi-mountainous counties that have always been short of grain or barely self-sufficient, twenty-five counties have now basically achieved food self-sufficiency or have begun to have a surplus, and grain production in the other twenty-seven counties has also increased in recent years. Therefore, as long as we strengthen leadership over work in mountainous areas, mobilize the people in mountainous areas to conscientiously carry out soil and water conservation work, and actively and steadily promote agricultural technology reform, it is entirely possible to achieve food self-sufficiency in mountainous areas. At the same time, the characteristic of production in mountainous areas is that it is suitable for diverse operations, so it is of great significance to do a good job in the purchase and sale of various local and special products. The meeting requested that commercial departments, purchasing departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels actively open up sales channels for various local and special products in mountainous areas, expand the scope of operations, appropriately organize purchasing networks, and carry out purchases in a planned manner. Because transportation in mountainous areas is inconvenient, in the coming period, in addition to the state building some highways and important truck roads, the meeting also decided to organize the masses to open up mountain paths and general truck roads in order to gradually form a transportation network in mountainous areas.

The meeting requested that each county, starting from this winter and next spring, take the township as a unit, mobilize the masses in mountainous areas to formulate mountainous area production plans based on local natural conditions, mass experience, and strength, and called on leading cadres at all levels and all cadres working in mountainous areas to continue to carry forward the style of hard work and plain living, share weal and woe with the masses, and conduct in-depth investigations and research to do a good job.

    争取山区粮食自给　充分利用山区资源
    河北加强对山区生产的领导
    新华社保定12日电　河北省最近举行山区工作会议，研究了领导山区人民争取粮食自给、开展多种经营的具体措施。
    会议认为，河北省山区有很优越的自然条件；绝大部分山区又是老革命根据地，群众觉悟程度比较高；农业已经实现高级合作化。全省五十二个一向缺粮或粮食仅能自给的山区和半山县份中，目前有二十五个县已经基本上做到粮食自给或开始有余，其他二十七个县粮食产量几年来也有提高。因此，只要加强对山区工作的领导，发动山区人民认真做好水土保持工作，积极地稳步地推行农业技术改革，实现山区粮食自给是完全可能的。同时，山区生产的特点是适宜于多种多样经营，因此做好各种土产特产品的收购和推销工作有着重要意义。会议要求各级商业部门采购部门和供销合作社要积极为山区各种土产特产品打开销路，扩大经营范围，适当组织采购网，有计划地进行收购。因为山区交通不便，今后一个时期除了由国家兴修一些公路和重要大车干道以外，会议还决定组织群众开辟山间小路和一般大车路，以便逐步形成山区交通网。
    会议要求各县从今冬明春开始，以乡为单位，发动山区群众根据当地自然条件、群众经验和力量制定出山区生产规划，并且号召各级领导干部和所有在山区工作的干部继续发扬艰苦朴素的作风，与群众共甘苦，深入调查研究做好工作。
