　　Don't Women Have an Obligation to Support Their Families?
    Xu Fang
    From the day a girl marries, her fate is controlled by her husband's family. In the old society of the past, this phenomenon was not surprising, but in the new society of equality between men and women, it is very strange that people still think that way.
    There is a female technician who is married and earns more than sixty yuan a month. Because her father's income is low and he has to support several younger siblings in school, the daughter sends twenty yuan to her father. The rest of the money is given to her mother-in-law to use. This incident caused a family storm. Her mother-in-law complained to everyone: Our family is really blessed to have married such a filial daughter-in-law. She sends money home whenever she has it. It's like we've added someone who only eats and doesn't earn money. It would be one thing if an older person grumbled a few times, but unexpectedly, the younger brother and sister-in-law who are studying at the university also joined in. The younger brother said: "Once she marries into our family, she is one of us. What right does she have to send money out? If she wants to send money, she should at least hold a family meeting to decide! Besides, only sons support their mothers, there is no reason for daughters to support their fathers!"
    The new female technician didn't want to argue with them, fearing it would cause more unhappiness. Late at night, she asked herself: Don't daughters have a responsibility to support their parents?
    A university professor has recently been furious with his wife because his wife gave her mother some money. It should arouse people's sympathy. The old lady's son died, leaving only this daughter, lonely and helpless. The daughter naturally has a responsibility to support her, especially since she is not taking money from her husband's pocket, but rather from her own salary as a middle school teacher. Strangely, even such a highly educated university professor has such a mindset! Equality between men and women has long been a well-known slogan, but when it comes to some personal interests, especially economic issues, the "equality" is forgotten. The old consciousness of male dominance buried deep in people's souls proudly dominates everything. Otherwise, why would women supporting their parents, which is as reasonable as men supporting their families, often cause unpleasant family storms?

　　妇女难道没有扶养家庭的义务
    徐芳
    一个女孩子从出嫁那一天起，她的命运就由婆家来支配了。在过去的旧社会，这种现象并不奇怪，可是在男女平等的新社会里，人们的脑子里仍是那么想，就十分可怪了。
    有一位女技术员，已经结婚，她的月薪是六十多元，因为父亲收入少，还要供应几个小弟弟上学，做女儿的就寄了二十块钱给她的父亲，其余的钱都交给婆婆使用，这件事情引起了一场家庭风波，她的婆婆逢人就是一顿诉落：咱们家真是有福气，娶了一个孝顺媳妇，有钱就往家寄，真是添了一个白吃饭的，就没有捞到一个挣钱的。上了年纪的人啰囌几句也就算了，想不到正在大学读书的小叔、小姑也凑上来了。小叔说：“嫁到我家就是我家的人，她有什么权力寄钱出去？要寄钱至少也得开个家庭会议来决定吧！况且只有儿子养妈的，没有叫女儿养父亲的道理！”
    这位新女技术员不愿和他们争吵，怕引起更多不愉快。夜深人静时，她扪心自问：难道女儿就没有扶养父母的责任吗？
    有一位大学教授近来对他的妻子大发雷霆，原因是妻子给了她的妈妈一些钱。说来是应该引起人们同情的，那位老太太的儿子死了，就剩下这个女儿，孤苦伶仃，做女儿的当然有扶养之责，何况她支出的不是从丈夫口袋里掏出来的，而是她自己在中学里教书的工资。奇怪的是这样一位高级知识分子的大学教授也是这么一副脑筋！男女平等早已为人所皆知的口号了，可是遇到一些切身利益有关的，特别是经济问题，就忘记了“平等”之说了。埋藏在人们灵魂深处的男权统治的旧意识就耀武扬威地支配一切了。要不然，妇女扶养父母本来和男子扶养家庭一样的合理，为什么常常引起不愉快的家庭风波呢？
