Thoughts After Seeing Han Shichang's Performance
　　Lun Qin
　　I have little research on Kunqu Opera, and I am also a layman when it comes to performing arts. This time, during the Kunqu Opera performance in Shanghai, I saw several good actors for the first time. In particular, after watching Mr. Han Shichang's performances several times, I was full of admiration and conviction, and I also had a few thoughts I wanted to share.
　　The characteristic of Han Shichang's performing art is that he is good at distinguishing and mastering the main characteristics of different roles in their respective specific situations (sometimes in extremely complex situations). Through this, he enters the depths of the character's heart, firmly grasps this core, and vividly displays it with pure and distinct images. When he plays completely different roles, his inner thoughts, feelings, and even actions are completely different. His individual performances may not look beautiful on the surface, but, as a whole, his performances are pure, full of thought and emotion. This is one of the most precious essences in the Chinese performing arts tradition, and it is also the true "truth" and "beauty" in art, which is worth studying and learning by actors and performance researchers. This is my first thought.
　　Han Shichang's artistic accomplishment is multifaceted. Just taking the repertoire performed in this demonstration performance as an example, he not only played various different characters such as Du Liniang in "The Peony Pavilion" and Liu Shi in "The Lion's Roar," but also played the completely folk-style "Fat Woman." "Fat Woman" comes from the sixth act "Village Woman's Narration" in the Yuan Dynasty play "Journey to the West Zaju" (written by Wu Changling), which is one of the oldest existing plays. We are very excited to see it still alive and full of vitality on the stage today. When Han Shichang plays "Fat Woman," he is completely different from when he plays Du Liniang, overflowing with a strong, simple, and joyful folk flavor. This kind of healthy, cheerful, and "earthy" performing art seems to be rare in Kunqu Opera, and it is worthy of our special attention and research. This is my second thought.
　　Mr. Han Shichang is very modest. In the many days of the so-called joint performance of "North and South Kunqu," he never performed the last play, often performing in the second or third play. Given Mr. Han's artistic accomplishment and his seniority, status, and reputation in the Kunqu Opera circle (and even the entire opera circle), this kind of modesty is particularly commendable. I believe that this spirit of modesty, like his profound artistic attainments, is worthy of serious study by actors of all opera genres. This is my third thought.
　　The treasures of nature have those that are easy to discover and those that are more difficult to discover. The same is true in art. In today's "Let a hundred flowers bloom," there is no doubt that any treasure will be discovered and will radiate more and more brilliance.

### 看韩世昌的表演有感

　　看韩世昌的表演有感
　　伦琴
    我对昆曲很少研究，对表演艺术也是门外汉。这次上海的昆曲观摩演出，其中有几位好演员，在我还是第一次看到。特别是看了韩世昌先生的几次演出，使我叹赏折服之余，还有几点感想想说。
    韩世昌表演艺术的特色是他善于辨别并且能够掌握住不同的角色在各自的具体情况下（有时候是在极其复杂的情况下）的主要特点，通过这一点进入角色的心灵深处，牢牢抓住这一核心，用纯朴而又鲜明的形象淋漓地发挥出来。他演截然不同的角色的时候，内心深处的思想、感情，以至行动都是截然不同的。他的个别演出从表面上看去可能并不漂亮，但是，从整个来说他的表演是纯朴的，饱含着思想、情感的。这正是中国表演艺术传统中最可宝贵的精华之一，也是艺术上真正的“真”和“美”，值得演员和表演研究者们研究和学习。这是感想之一。
    韩世昌的艺术修养是多方面的。单拿这次观摩演出中所演的剧目来看，他不但演了“游园惊梦”的杜丽娘，“狮吼记”的柳氏等各种不同的人物，而且还演了完全民间风格的“胖姑”。“胖姑”出于元曲“西游记杂剧”（吴昌龄作）中的第六出“村姑演说”，这是现存的若干历史最久的剧目之一。我们今天看到它仍然生气勃勃地活在舞台上，不能不感到十分兴奋。韩世昌演
  “胖姑”时和他演杜丽娘时完全不同，洋溢着浓厚的淳朴、快乐的民间风味。这种健康开朗的、“泥土味”十足的表演艺术在昆曲中似乎不多见，值得我们特别注意和研究。这是感想之二。
    韩世昌先生十分谦逊。在所谓
  “南北昆”合演的许多天中，他没有一次演最后一出戏，经常在第二，三出。以韩先生的艺术修养和在昆曲界（以至整个戏曲界）的资历、地位和声誉来说，这种谦逊不能不说是特别难能可贵的。我以为，这种谦逊精神，正像他的深厚的艺术造诣一样，值得各剧种的演员认真地学习。这是感想之三。
    自然界的宝藏，有容易发掘的，有比较不容易发掘的。艺术上也是如此。在“百花齐放”的今天，毫无疑问，任何宝藏都将被发掘出来，越来越放射出光辉。
