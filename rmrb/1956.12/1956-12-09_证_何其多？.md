　　So Many "Certificates"!
　　Deng Xuanzuo
    I have a wallet that is stuffed full, and what's inside isn't money, but various kinds of certificates that are even more important than money.
    There really are too many certificates. In terms of names, besides the well-known "Trade Union Membership Card" and "Military Service Certificate," there are also "Provincial People's Committee Temporary Entry Permit," "Warehouse Work Permit," "Warehouse Inspection Certificate," "Clinic Treatment Card," "Political Theory Study Attendance Certificate," "Library Card," "Canteen Meal Card," and "Public Bicycle Riding Permit." This is already quite a lot. If you add "Cotton Cloth Purchase Certificate," "Meat Purchase Certificate," "Oil Purchase Certificate," and so on, there are no fewer than twenty kinds. The sources of the certificates vary; some are nationally unified, some are formulated by the province, some are issued by the organization, and some are even issued by departments within the organization, such as the "Meal Card" and "Riding Permit" issued by our Secretariat. Almost all certificates include items such as name, age, place of origin, gender, and work unit. Many also require a photo and a seal. In terms of color, red, yellow, blue, white, and black are all available. It can truly be described as "colorful and dazzling."
    Take me as an example. How many times do I have to show my certificates on an ordinary workday? When I go to the office in the morning, I show my "Office Work Permit." When I go to the warehouse to understand the material reserves, I show my "Warehouse Work Permit." When I ride a public bicycle to a meeting at the Provincial People's Committee, I show my "Riding Permit" and "Provincial People's Committee Temporary Entry Permit." When I return to the office cafeteria for a meal, I show my "Meal Card." When I attend a political study report after work, I show my "Attendance Certificate." If I have a minor illness or check the safety equipment in the warehouse at night, I also have to use my "Medical Certificate" or "Warehouse Inspection Certificate." My little wallet is really tired. All day long, I see certificates of various colors going in and out. No wonder the originally brand-new wallet is worn out in less than a year. There are quite a few people in my situation.
    Different certificates have different uses. Some are indeed necessary, but is it necessary to have so many certificates? Is such a detailed "division of labor" necessary? This is a question worth studying.
    For example, could a single "Office Work Permit" prove that a person can enter and exit the office, borrow a public bicycle, eat in the office cafeteria, see a doctor at the office clinic, and participate in political study? If he needs to enter and exit other departments for work, can he simply have the seal of other units stamped on this "Office Work Permit" to make it valid? I think it is possible.
    Having too many certificates is not beneficial. It is troublesome, expensive, difficult to keep safe, and even devalues the role of certificates. There is a story: an office worker went to a restaurant to eat and forgot to bring money, so he pawned his "Political Study Attendance Certificate" to the restaurant owner. With so many certificates, and no uniformity, and so many issuing units, anything can be "certified," and it is inevitably difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake, and the good and the bad are mixed together. We opposed "five excesses" in the past, but "excessive certificates" was not mentioned. I think this phenomenon of issuing certificates indiscriminately should also be "opposed"!

### “证”何其多？

　　“证”何其多？
　　邓瑄祚
    我有一个皮夹胀得满满的，里面装的并不是钱钞，而是比钱钞更重要的各式各样的证件。
    证件确实太多，从名称来说，除了大家熟知的“工会会员证”、
  “兵役证”以外，还有“省人民委员会临时出入证”、“仓库工作证”、“仓库检查证”“医务所诊疗证”、“政治理论学习听课证”、“图书馆借书证”、“伙食团用膳证”、
  “公用自行车乘车证”。这已经够呛了，如再加上“棉布购买证”、“购肉证”、“购油证”……等等，真不下二十多种。证件的来源，有全国统一的，有全省制订的，有机关印发的，甚至还有机关内的科室，例如我们秘书科颁发的“用膳证”、“乘车证”。差不多的证件上都少不了姓名、年龄、籍贯、性别、工作单位等项目，有不少的还要贴上照片、盖上印鉴。从颜色来看，红、黄、蓝、白、黑都具备了，真可谓“五光十色、琳琅满目”。
    拿我来说吧，一个普通的工作日要交验多少次证件：早上进机关上班，交验“机关工作证”；到仓库了解物资储备情况，交验“仓库工作证”；骑公家车子到省人民委员会开会，交验“乘车证”和“省人民委员会临时出入证”；回到机关食堂用饭，交验“用膳证”，下班听政治学习报告，交验“听课证”；傍晚到工人文化宫散散步，交验“工会会员证”；假如是生点小病，或是晚上到仓库检查一下安全设备，那还得劳“医疗证”或“仓库检查证”的驾。我这小皮夹也真够辛苦，一天只见各种不同颜色的证件进进出出，也难怪原是崭新的皮夹，用不到一年眼看就磨坏了。像我这种情况的人却不在少数。
    不同的证件有不同的用途。有些也确有必要，但证件是不是要这么多？“分工”要这么的细呢？却是个值得研究的问题。
    比方说：在一个“机关工作证”上，是不是可以证明这个人可以进出本机关，可以借用公家的自行车，可以到机关食堂内用饭，可以上机关的医务所看病，可以参加政治学习。假若他因工作需要进出其他部门，是否可以就在这份“机关工作证”上加盖其他单位的印戳而有效呢？我认为是可以的。
    证件多了，并没有什么好处。费事、费钱、难保管，甚至贬低了证件的作用。有这样的事：一个机关工作人员上馆子吃东西，忘了带钱，就把“政治学习听课证”押给饭馆的老板。证件多了，又不统一，填发的单位又多，什么都可以“证明”，又难免真伪难辨，鱼龙混杂。过去反对过“五多”，但其中没有提到“证件多”，我看这种滥发证件的现象也该“反”一下吧！
