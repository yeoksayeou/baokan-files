Xinhua News Agency, December 4th, Moscow dispatch: According to TASS, after talks between the Soviet and Romanian government delegations, a joint communiqué was signed on December 3rd.

The communiqué stated that the talks between the Soviet and Romanian government delegations were conducted in a spirit of friendship, sincerity, and full mutual understanding. Both sides comprehensively studied all issues related to the national interests of the Soviet Union and Romania, and the unshakable desire of the two peoples: to strengthen cooperation and unity among socialist countries, and to develop and improve mutually beneficial political and economic relations, as well as cultural ties, based on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, independence and national sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs.

The communiqué stated that relying on comprehensive fraternal mutual assistance, and faithful to the great banner of peace, democracy, and socialism, the Soviet Union and Romania will continue to advance on such a path in fraternal cooperation with other socialist countries, which means comprehensive development of the economy and people's welfare for the Soviet and Romanian peoples, and the guarantee and consolidation of national independence and genuine national prosperity.

Both delegations unanimously stated that the principles put forward in the Soviet government's declaration of October 30, regarding developing and further strengthening the foundations of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, will contribute to further strengthening the friendship between our two peoples. The two countries are in complete agreement on the current international situation.

The communiqué stated that both government delegations found that they were in complete agreement on the current international situation. Both sides stated that current international disputes should only be resolved through patient negotiations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence among countries.

The communiqué pointed out that imperialist forces are attempting to undermine the easing of international tensions that has emerged, launching attacks on the freedom of peoples of all countries, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and attempting to split the socialist family of nations on which the people of all countries place their main hope for maintaining peace. The response to these attempts must be that all freedom-loving socialist countries, all peace-loving forces, must unite more closely to defend peace, and oppose the imperialist strength and aggressive policies that threaten the security of all peoples and universal peace.

The armed aggression against Egypt and the barbaric bombings by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel have caused countless casualties and damage to cities and villages among the peaceful residents of Egypt. Due to these actions, the Suez Canal has been damaged, which has brought significant losses to international navigation (including navigation for the Soviet Union and Romania). The peoples of the Soviet Union and Romania, like the peoples of other countries, firmly condemn this act of aggression against Egypt. The Soviet Union and Romania declare that the United Kingdom, France, and Israel should immediately withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory in accordance with United Nations resolutions. The Soviet Union and Romania support Egypt's just demand to punish the aggressors and compensate Egypt for the losses suffered due to the war.

The communiqué continued, stating that both delegations believe that, given the imperialist forces' attempt to escalate the international situation, the most urgent task, which is of decisive significance for strengthening peace, is disarmament. The Soviet and Romanian governments will make every effort to resolve the issue of disarmament, so that the people of all countries can be freed from the burden of expanding armaments, in order to consolidate universal peace.

The communiqué stated that the Soviet Union and Romania believe that the situation in which China, one of the founding members of the United Nations, is deprived of the right to occupy its legitimate position in this organization is intolerable. Excluding the representatives of the government of 600 million Chinese people from participating in the United Nations and its various agencies is the most blatant violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, and also seriously affects the work of this organization. Because, without the participation of the People's Republic of China, no major international issue involving peace and the security of all countries can be resolved. The legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored without delay. Supporting Hungary's struggle to defend the people's democratic system.

Referring to the events in Hungary, the communiqué stated that both delegations believe that the reactionary forces in Hungary, taking advantage of the Hungarian working people's desire to eliminate errors and shortcomings in domestic policy, attempted to eliminate the socialist system and establish a fascist hotbed in Hungary that would threaten peace in Europe. It is gratifying that the healthy forces of Hungary, united around the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, with the help of other socialist countries, defended the achievements of the people's democratic system.

Both sides believe that the socialist countries could not ignore the dangerous situation in Hungary at that time, which not only threatened the socialist achievements of the Hungarian working people, but also threatened the security of the socialist countries bordering Hungary. The Romanian government delegation believes that the Soviet government, at the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, agreed to provide it with assistance to contain the bloody arrogance of the reactionary forces, which is the Soviet Union's implementation of its international obligations to the working people of Hungary and other socialist countries. The slanderous campaign launched by international reactionary forces surrounding the Hungarian events aims to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs, to complicate the international situation, and to divert people's attention from the aggression against Egypt by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel.

Determined to make renewed efforts to establish an all-European security system.

The communiqué continued, stating that during the talks, both delegations studied the issue of European security with the utmost attention. The Soviet and Romanian delegations declared that they are determined to make renewed efforts to establish an all-European security system.

However, under the current circumstances, when aggressive military blocs still exist in Western Europe, when West Germany is being militarized and revanchist forces are intensifying their activities, when the United States and NATO countries are still maintaining large numbers of troops and bases near socialist countries while refusing to reduce armaments and peacefully resolve international disputes, the Soviet Union and Romania cannot fail to be aware of this danger that threatens all peace-loving countries. Both sides believe that it is appropriate for Soviet troops to be temporarily stationed in Romania under the Warsaw Treaty. In accordance with the Soviet government's declaration of October 30, the Soviet government and the Romanian government will, as the international situation develops, consult with each other and with other Warsaw Treaty member states on the question of whether it is necessary for Soviet troops to continue to be stationed in Romania. An agreement was reached on the mutual supply of goods and Soviet aid.

The communiqué finally discussed economic and cultural cooperation between the Soviet Union and Romania.

The communiqué stated that both sides will continue to comprehensively develop and strengthen economic relations between the two countries in the future on the basis of equality, mutual respect for national sovereignty, and fraternal mutual assistance and mutual benefit. After studying, both sides reached an agreement on the supplementary supply of certain commodities that are extremely important for ensuring industrial production and improving the living standards of the residents.

In 1957, the Soviet government will supply Romania with iron ore, metallurgical coking coal, pipes, and other commodities, and agreed to provide technical and equipment assistance in the construction of chemical and petroleum industrial enterprises in Romania. The Romanian government will supply the Soviet Union with commodities necessary for the Soviet national economy.

In view of Romania's poor grain harvest this year, the Soviet government also agreed to supply Romania with 450,000 tons of wheat on credit in the first half of 1957, and to supply 60,000 tons of feed grains in a manner that will be collected according to trade agreements.

Both delegations agreed that a portion of the long-term loans that the Soviet Union had previously granted to Romania that were to be repaid from 1957 to 1959 will be postponed. All financial account issues between the two countries will also be resolved on the principle of mutual benefit.

The communiqué was signed by N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, on behalf of the Soviet side, and Chivu Stoica, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, on behalf of the Romanian side.

　　苏罗两国政府代表团发表会谈声明
    加强同其他社会主义国家的合作和团结
    发展两国平等互利的政治、经济和文化关系
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府代表团和罗马尼亚政府代表团经过会谈以后，在12月3日签订了一项会谈声明。
    声明说，苏罗两国政府代表团的会谈是本着友好诚恳和互相充分谅解的精神进行的。双方全面研究了有关苏罗两国的国家利益和两国人民的不可动摇的愿望的一切问题，这种不可动摇的愿望就是：加强社会主义国家之间的合作和团结，根据完全平等、尊重领土完整、独立和国家主权、不干涉内政的原则来发展和改进两国互利的政治和经济关系以及文化联系。
    声明说，苏联和罗马尼亚依靠全面的兄弟互助，忠实于伟大的和平、民主和社会主义旗帜，同其他社会主义国家兄弟合作，今后仍将在这样一条道路上前进，这条道路对苏罗两国人民意味着经济和人民福利得到全面发展，国家独立和真正的民族繁荣得到保障和巩固。
    两国代表团一致声明，苏联政府10月30日发表的关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言中所提出的原则，将会有助于进一步加强我们两国人民之间的友谊。两国对当前国际局势的意见完全一致
    声明说，两国政府代表团发现双方对当前国际局势的看法是完全一致的。双方声明，当前的国际争端只应当依据各国和平共处的原则通过耐心的谈判来加以解决。
    声明指出，帝国主义势力企图破坏已经出现的国际紧张局势的缓和、向各国人民的自由发动进攻、干涉其他国家的内政，企图分裂各国人民在维护和平方面寄予主要期望的社会主义国家大家庭。对这些企图的回答必须是，一切爱好自由的社会主义国家人民、一切和平力量更加团结起来保卫和平、反对威胁各国人民安全和普遍和平的帝国主义实力和侵略政策。
    英、法和以色列三国武装进攻埃及和进行野蛮的轰炸，造成埃及和平居民无数的伤亡和城乡的破坏。由于这些行动，苏伊士运河遭到破坏，这给国际通航（其中也包括对苏联和罗马尼亚的通航）带来重大的损失。苏联和罗马尼亚的人民同别国的人民一样坚决谴责对埃及的这种侵略行为。苏罗两国声明，英国、法国和以色列应当根据联合国决议立即把军队撤出埃及领土。苏罗两国支持埃及主张惩办侵略者和赔偿埃及由于战争遭到的损失的公正要求。
    声明接着说，两国代表团认为，鉴于帝国主义势力企图加剧国际局势，目前最迫切的，对加强和平具有决定意义的工作是裁军。苏联和罗马尼亚政府将为解决裁军问题尽一切努力，以使各国人民摆脱扩充军备的负担，以有利于巩固普遍和平。
    声明说，苏联和罗马尼亚认为，联合国的创始者之一的中国被剥夺了在这个组织里据有自己合法位置的权利的情况，是令人不能容忍的。排除六亿中国人民的政府的代表参加联合国和联合国各种机构，是对联合国宪章的原则最粗暴的破坏，并且也严重地影响到这个组织的工作。因为，如果没有中华人民共和国参加，就不能解决任何一个牵涉到和平和各国安全的重大国际问题。应该刻不容缓地恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利。支持匈牙利捍卫人民民主制度的斗争
    声明在谈到匈牙利事件的时候说，两国代表团认为，匈牙利的反动势力利用匈牙利劳动人民要求消除在对内政策方面的错误和缺点的愿望，企图消灭社会主义制度和在匈牙利建立威胁欧洲和平的法西斯主义策源地。团结在工农革命政府周围的匈牙利的健康力量，依靠其他社会主义国家的帮助，捍卫住了人民民主制度的成果，这一情况是令人满意的。
    双方认为，社会主义国家不可能对匈牙利当时的危险局势置之不理，当时这不仅威胁到匈牙利劳动人民的社会主义成果，而且还威胁到与匈牙利接壤的社会主义国家的安全。罗马尼亚政府代表团认为，苏联政府根据匈牙利工农革命政府的请求，同意对它提供援助以遏止反动势力血腥的嚣张活动，乃是苏联执行自己对匈牙利和其他社会主义国家劳动人民的国际义务。国际反动势力围绕匈牙利事件掀起的诽谤运动，目的在于干涉匈牙利内政，在于使国际局势复杂化，转移人民对英国、法国和以色列侵略埃及的注意力。
  决心再次努力建立全欧安全体系
    声明接着说，在会谈过程中，两国代表团以最大的注意力研究了欧洲各国安全问题。苏罗两国代表团宣布，他们决心再次努力建立全欧安全体系。
    然而，在目前的情况下，当西欧还存在着侵略性的军事集团的时候，当西德正在军国主义化而复仇主义势力正在加紧活动的时候，当美国和北大西洋集团国家还在社会主义国家附近保持着大量军队和基地而又拒绝裁减军备和和平解决国际争端的时候，苏联和罗马尼亚不能不意识到这种威胁着一切爱好和平的国家的危险。双方认为，苏联军队根据华沙条约暂时驻扎在罗马尼亚境内是适宜的。根据苏联政府10月30日的宣言，苏联政府和罗马尼亚政府将随着国际局势的发展，彼此商议以及同华沙条约其他缔约国商议苏联军队继续驻扎在罗马尼亚境内是否有必要的问题。就互相供应商品和苏联援助达成协议
    声明最后谈到了苏罗两国经济和文化的合作。
    声明说，双方今后仍将在平等、互相尊重国家主权、兄弟的互助互利的基础上全面地发展和加强两国之间的经济关系。双方经过研究以后，就补充供应某些对保证工业生产和提高居民生活水平极为重要的商品的问题达成了协议。
    苏联政府将于1957年供给罗马尼亚铁矿、冶金用焦煤、管子等商品，并且同意在罗马尼亚建设化学和石油工业企业方面提供技术和设备援助。罗马尼亚政府将以苏联国民经济所必需的商品供给苏联。
    鉴于罗马尼亚今年粮食歉收，苏联政府还同意在1957年上半年以赊卖方式供给罗马尼亚四十五万吨小麦，并且以根据贸易协定收款的方式供应六万吨饲料谷物。
    两国代表团协议，苏联过去给予罗马尼亚的一部分应在1957年至1959年偿还的长期贷款将缓期归还。两国间一切财政帐目问题，也将在互利的原则上加以解决。
    在声明上签字的，苏联方面的代表是苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁；罗马尼亚方面的代表是罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡。
