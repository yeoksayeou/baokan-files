Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 21st: The first session of the Second Anshan Municipal People's Congress was held from the 16th to the 20th. More than 300 representatives carefully reviewed the work of the previous People's Committee and offered criticisms and suggestions on issues such as increasing production and practicing economy, and resolving difficulties in people's lives.

The representatives focused on the phenomena of extravagance and waste, and overstaffing that exist in some government agencies and enterprises, and offered criticisms and positive suggestions for improvement. Representatives Wang Ziyou, Han Weiyu, and others cited facts about the losses caused by neglecting quality and safety in industrial enterprises, and demanded that industrial production departments actively take measures to improve quality, reduce costs, and pay attention to safety. Representative Liu Chengyou emphasized the great significance of conserving electricity. He said that if Anshan's industrial departments could reduce electricity consumption quotas by 1% each year, the electricity saved would be enough to supply a factory as large as the Anshan Iron and Steel's steelmaking plant for a year's production. If each electricity-using household in the city could save one kilowatt-hour of electricity per month, that electricity could be used to weave 135,000 meters of cloth or mill 2,700,000 jin of rice. He suggested that the representatives should widely publicize the significance of saving water and electricity among workers and citizens. Some representatives pointed out that there is still a phenomenon of wasting grain among residents, criticizing the grain department for having excessively loose ration control. Finally, all the representatives passed a resolution to launch a comprehensive campaign to increase production and practice economy throughout the city.

The representatives also offered positive suggestions regarding the difficulties currently existing in the lives of citizens, such as traffic congestion, insufficient supply of certain non-staple foods, and some workers not having housing. They pointed out that there has been traffic congestion in the city recently, but the utilization rate of self-provided vehicles in some enterprise departments is very low, and they are left idle on weekdays except for picking up and dropping off employees. If the potential of these vehicles can be exploited, the difficulty of insufficient transportation can be basically resolved. They also suggested that cadres and workers with relatively spacious housing should promote the spirit of sharing joys and hardships and voluntarily give their surplus houses to workers who urgently need housing.

On the last day of the meeting, the representatives unanimously elected Li Weimin as Mayor, and Wang Yixin, Liu Yanlin, Wang Fengqi, and others as Deputy Mayors.

    对某些机关企业铺张浪费和机构臃肿现象
    鞍山市人民代表提出批评建议
    新华社鞍山21日电　鞍山市在16日到20日举行第二届人民代表大会第一次会议。三百多名代表在会上认真审查了上届人民委员会的工作，并且对增产节约、解决人民生活中的困难等问题提出了批评和建议。
    代表们针对目前有些机关企业中存在的铺张浪费、机构臃肿等现象，提出了批评和积极改进的意见。代表王子佑、韩维玉等列举了工业企业中由于不重视质量和安全造成损失的事实，要求工业生产部门积极采取措施提高质量，降低成本和注意安全。代表刘承祐着重指出节约用电的重大意义，他说，如果鞍山的工业部门每年能降低耗电定额1％，节约的电量足够供鞍钢炼钢厂那样大的工厂一年的生产用电。全市每个用电户每月能节约一度电，这些电就可以用来织十三万五千公尺布，或磨二百七十万斤米。他建议代表们要在工人和市民中，广泛宣传节约用水、用电的意义。有的代表指出目前在居民中还存在浪费粮食的现象，批评粮食部门掌握定量偏松。最后，全体代表通过了在全市范围内开展全面的增产节约运动的决议。
    对目前市民生活中存在的交通拥挤、某些副食品供应不足、有些工人没有房子住等困难，代表们也提出了积极的建议。他们提出，最近市内交通拥挤，但是有些企业部门的自备车辆使用率很低，平日除了接送职工上下班以外，都闲放着。如果能够发挥这部分车辆的潜力，交通工具不足的困难便基本上可以解决。他们还建议住宅比较宽敞的干部和职工，能够发扬同甘共苦的精神，主动把多余的房子让给急需房子的工人住。
    在会议的最后一天，代表们一致选举了李维民为市长，王一新、刘雁林、王凤岐等为副市长。
