    Walking along the newly built Yingxia Railway, you can see that on this railway, there is a bridge on average every five kilometers, and an average of more than two culverts within a kilometer. According to those who have counted the bridges and culverts, this 697.72-kilometer-long railway has a total of 151 bridges and 1,592 culverts.

    Wang Zhisui, a bridge engineer with the rank of captain in the Railway Corps, has braved the wind, sun, and rain running along the valleys and rivers on both sides of the Yingxia Railway to build a bridge or a culvert. However, this bridge engineer is actually someone who is unwilling to build big bridges.

    Once, he returned from the Gongchuan River with bridge design drawings and felt somewhat unhappy. The design department's design was to build an eighty-meter-long, five-arch bridge over the Gongchuan River, but he was unwilling to build such a large bridge there. The Gongchuan River is not wide, and he had personally inspected the riverbed, banks, and the sand and pebbles in the river, and also discovered an old bridge built in the first year of the Tianqi reign of the Ming Dynasty. This bridge was built with weathered stone, lime, and earth, and had only three arches, thirty-six meters long.

    Why must we build bridges twice as large as the original bridges? -- he asked the design department. The comrades in the design department replied to him, we must build bridges according to scientific principles!

    Wang Zhisui pointed out to the comrades in the design department: That old bridge has not been destroyed yet, and its four-hundred-year history is the basis. However, the design department insisted on their opinion: When building a bridge, the maximum river flow must be taken into account, and an ancient bridge cannot be used as the basis for revising the design. Wang Zhisui felt somewhat unhappy, but he did not draw conclusions too early. Soviet experts had told him: Nature cannot be deceived, it will prove to you what has happened and what has not happened.

    He returned to the Gongchuan River, inspected the river again, and found an even shorter and lower stone bridge upstream, as well as a wooden bridge. Wang Zhisui also inquired about the situation from the local people on both sides of the river, and learned that the river's water flow was honest and regular, never wild or flooded. At this time, Wang Zhisui again expressed his opinion to the design department: There is no need to make the bridge body so long. The design department adopted his opinion and shortened the five-arch bridge to a four-arch bridge. Wang Zhisui insisted on shortening it to three arches, but the design department disagreed. Later, when the leaders of the Railway Corps and Soviet experts came to inspect the project, they believed that Wang Zhisui's opinion was correct. Finally, the five-arch bridge was changed to a three-and-a-half-arch bridge. Shortening the bridge by one and a half arches saved the country about 40,000 yuan.

    As soon as this matter passed, Wang Zhisui went to the site to appraise the design of a culvert project. When he arrived, he immediately discovered that there was no need to build such a large culvert. The place where the culvert was to be built was a dry depression, surrounded by a lot of grass, and had never experienced major flooding. However, he discovered a contradictory phenomenon: not far from where the culvert was to be built, there were several bald mountains; since they were bald mountains, the water from the mountains would flow straight down during the rainy season, but the place where the culvert was to be built did not seem to have been impacted by flash floods. So, where did the water from the mountains go after it flowed down? In order to uncover this secret, Wang Zhisui led some people along the mountain stream to investigate. They walked seven or eight li and found nothing. Wang Zhisui encouraged everyone not to give up halfway and continue to investigate. They turned over a mountain and saw a large forest, and people were happy. The secret was revealed: the rainwater flowing down from the mountains during the rainy season was largely absorbed by the forest; only a small portion of the water flowed to the place where the culvert was to be built, and the water flow became small and slow.

    This discovery reduced the diameter of the culvert they were going to build by more than one meter, saving about 5,000 yuan in construction costs.

    The bridge engineer Wang Zhisui, whom we interviewed, is unwilling to build unnecessary large bridges and large culverts. He has changed the design of a total of 227 bridges and culverts, saving the country a total of 1.47 million yuan.

    Comrades from the Railway Corps told us: Several bridge engineers in their unit are similar to Wang Zhisui, they are unwilling to build unnecessary large bridges, unwilling to build large bridges over small streams, and unwilling to spend more of the country's money on a bridge. According to people from the Engineering Department of the Railway Corps, among the 151 bridges and 1,592 culverts built on the Yingxia Railway, the original design of 64 bridges and 803 culverts was improved based on the opinions of the bridge engineers: some shortened the length, some were crossed out from the original drawings, and some used granite instead of concrete. Calculated, it saved the country more than 10 million yuan in total.

### 不愿意凭空修大桥的人

    不愿意凭空修大桥的人
    新华社记者　刘葵华、周长宗
    沿着才修成的鹰厦铁路走，可以看到在这条铁路上，平均不到五公里就有一座桥梁，在一公里的距离内平均有两个以上涵洞。据数过桥梁，涵洞的人说，这条六百九十七点七二公里长的铁路，共有一百五十一座桥梁和一千五百九十二个涵洞。
    铁道兵的桥梁工程师王志遂大尉，为了修建一座桥或一个涵洞，在鹰厦铁路两旁的山谷河川里，不知冒着风吹、日晒、雨淋跑了多少路。可是，这位桥梁工程师竟是一个不愿意修大桥的人。
  　有一次，他带着桥梁设计图从贡川河上回来，心里有些不痛快。设计部门作的设计是，要在贡川河上修建一座八十公尺长的五孔大桥，而他却不愿意在那里修那样大的桥。贡川河并不宽，他到那里实地察看过河床、河岸以及河里的细沙和卵石，还发现了明朝天启元年修的一座旧桥。这座桥是用风化石和石灰、泥土筑的，只有三孔、三十六公尺长。
    干吗我们修桥非要修得比原来的桥大一倍呢？——他问设计部门。设计部门的同志回答他，我们修桥要按照科学根据才行！
    王志遂向设计部门的同志指出：那座旧桥现在还没有毁坏，四百年的历史就是根据。可是设计部门坚持他们的意见：修一座桥，必须把最大的河水流量预计在内，而不能以一座古代的桥作为修改设计的根据。王志遂心里有些不痛快，可是他没有过早下结论。苏联专家对他说过：大自然是不可以欺骗的，发生过和没有发生过的事，它都会给你证明。
    他回到贡川河上，再次沿着河流察看，又在上游发现了一座修得更短、更矮的石桥，另外还有一座木桥。王志遂又向河两岸的老百姓询问情况，了解到这条河的水性是老老实实、规规矩矩的，从来没撒过野，没泛滥过。这时候，王志遂又向设计部门提出意见：没有必要把桥身拉得很长。设计部门采纳了他的意见，把五孔桥缩短为四孔桥。王志遂坚持要缩短到三孔，设计部门却不同意。后来，铁道兵部队首长和苏联专家前来察看工程的时候，认为王志遂的意见是正确的。最后，把五孔桥改为三孔半桥。桥缩短了一孔半，为国家节省了约四万元。
    这件事刚过去，王志遂接着又到现场去鉴定一座涵洞的设计工程。到了那里，他立即发现那座涵洞没有必要修那样大。要修涵洞的那个地方，是一片干洼地，四周长了很多草，没有发生过大水。但是，他发现了一个矛盾现象：离要修涵洞的地方不远，有好几座秃山；既然是光秃秃的山，一到雨季，山上的水就会直冲而下，不过，要修涵洞的那块地方，倒不像受过山洪冲击过的样子。那么，山上的水流下来以后，到那里去了呢？为了揭开这个秘密，王志遂带领了一些人沿着山涧去察看。他们走了七、八里路什么也没有发现。王志遂鼓励大家不要半途而废，继续向前察看。他们转过了一个山头，看到了一片大树林，人们都高兴起来。秘密揭开了：雨季中从山上流下来的山水，被树林大量吸收了；只有一部分水要流到准备修涵洞的那个地方去，水流也变得小而缓慢了。
    这一发现，使他们准备要修的涵洞孔径缩小了一公尺多，节省了约五千元的修建费。
    我们访问的这个不愿意修不必要的大桥、大涵洞的桥梁工程师王志遂大尉，经他手改变设计的桥梁涵洞共有二百二十七座，为国家节约的钱共有一百四十七万元。
    铁道兵的同志告诉我们：他们部队的几位桥梁工程师，跟王志遂都有些相同，他们都不愿意修建不必要的大桥，不愿意把大桥架在小溪上，不愿意在一座桥上多花国家的钱。据铁道兵工程部的人说：鹰厦铁路上修建的一百五十一座桥梁和一千五百九十二个涵洞，其中有六十四座桥梁和八百零三个涵洞根据桥梁工程师们的意见改善了原来设计：有的缩短了长度，有的从原来设计图纸上勾掉了，有的用花岗石代替了混凝土。计算起来，共为国家节约了一千多万元。
