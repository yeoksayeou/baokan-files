Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 28th: Most of the two hundred-plus proposals submitted by the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress representatives in August of this year have been responsibly addressed by the relevant departments.

    The proposals from the representatives of the Municipal People's Congress included issues related to the full utilization of human and material resources and the conservation of state property, as well as issues related to improving the material and cultural life of residents. The Municipal People's Committee assigned these proposals to the relevant units for research and handling, and conducted three inspections of the handling process. During the process, the Municipal People's Committee also invited more than 300 representatives of the Municipal People's Congress to hold 17 symposiums to jointly study methods for handling the proposals, ensuring that all proposals were handled seriously.

    Soon after Representative Liu Zhongqi proposed that original machine tools should be fully utilized, the Shanghai heavy industry departments began conducting surveys and verifications of surplus equipment throughout the entire sector, and specifically designated some factories to be responsible for machine tool repair work. Currently, more than 300 old machine tools have been or are being planned to be converted into specialized machine tools. After Representative Xia Xiaolong suggested repairing the existing damaged carts to increase the number of vehicles to alleviate transportation capacity shortages, the person in charge of the Municipal Transportation Bureau worked with grassroots unit employees to develop some repair methods, repairing more than 1,800 damaged carts, which doubled the capacity of damaged carts to accept consignment. Other proposals on increasing production and practicing economy, such as correcting public buses for unreasonable fuel savings that damage the machines, have also had good results in actual implementation.

    Based on the proposals of the representatives of the Municipal People's Congress, more than 300 neighborhood nursery stations were newly built in the city in the second half of the year. More than 400 women who originally worked as heavy porters at docks and warehouses have been or are being gradually transferred to lighter jobs. After the method of improving registration for medical treatment was implemented in many districts, the serious situation of citizens queuing up for registration has improved. The legal advisory office, which is called "intimate friend" by the people, established another office in Shanghai on December 18th. These proposals that have already been implemented, as well as a small number of proposals that are being processed and those that are currently impossible to implement, will be explained to all representatives case by case at the upcoming first session of the Second Shanghai Municipal People's Congress.

    上海市人民代表提出的提案
    大部分得到认真处理
    新华社上海28日电　上海市人民代表大会代表在今年8月提出的二百多件提案，大部分已经由各有关部门负责进行了处理。
    市人民代表大会代表提案中，有关于充分利用人力、物力、爱护国家资财方面的问题，也有改善居民物质、文化生活方面的问题。市人民委员会把这些提案分别责成各有关单位研究处理后，并对处理情况进行了三次检查。在处理过程中，市人民委员会还邀请三百多位市人民代表大会代表分别举行了十七次座谈会，共同研究处理提案的办法，使全部提案得到了认真的处理。
    代表刘仲奇提出应充分利用原有机床的提案以后不久，上海重工业部门就开始在全部门范围内进行多余设备的调查核对工作，并专门划出一些厂来担任机床检修工作。目前旧机床已经改装或正在计划改装为专用机床的有三百多台。代表夏小龙建议修理原有的破塌车来增加车辆以减少运输力不足的困难以后，市交通运输局负责人就和基层单位的职工共同研究出一些修理办法，修好了一千八百多部塌车，使塌车承接托运的能力增加了一倍。其他如纠正公共汽车因不合理的节约燃料，以致损害机器等一些增产节约的提案，在实际执行中，也已经有了良好的效果。
    根据市人民代表大会代表的提议，全市在下半年新建了三百多个里弄托儿站。原来在码头仓库等处做繁重的搬运工作的四百多名妇女，已经或正在陆续调做轻便工作。改进挂号看病的办法在许多区执行后，市民排队挂号看病的严重情况已经有了好转。被人民称作“知心朋友”的法律顾问处，12月18日又在上海建立了一个。这些已经办到的提案，和少数正在办理和目前还不可能办到的提案，在即将举行的上海市第二届人民代表大会第一次会议上，将向全体代表逐案交代。
