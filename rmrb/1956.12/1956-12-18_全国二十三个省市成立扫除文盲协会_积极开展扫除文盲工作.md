    Twenty-three Provinces and Cities Nationwide Establish Illiteracy Elimination Associations and Actively Carry Out Illiteracy Elimination Work

    (Our Newspaper) Since the beginning of this year, twenty-three provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Yunnan, have successively established illiteracy elimination associations or preparatory committees for illiteracy elimination associations. Most counties, cities, and grassroots townships in various provinces and cities have also generally established illiteracy elimination associations.

    Over the past year, illiteracy elimination associations in various regions have actively assisted the government in carrying out illiteracy elimination work and have achieved great results. Shanxi, Jiangsu, Fujian, Liaoning, Hubei, and Guizhou provinces have convened representative meetings of illiteracy elimination associations at all levels, or meetings of illiteracy elimination cadres, teachers of farmers' spare-time cultural schools, and activists in illiteracy elimination, promoting the development of illiteracy elimination work.

    Some provincial and municipal illiteracy elimination associations have also organized members of the illiteracy elimination associations and relevant departments to go deep into the grassroots to inspect the work.

    Grassroots illiteracy elimination associations in various regions have developed members on the basis of mobilizing the masses and mobilized literate people to participate in illiteracy elimination work. For example, in Shandong Province, the illiteracy elimination association and the illiteracy elimination work team mobilized three million literate people in rural areas to participate in illiteracy elimination work. Xinjiang County in Shanxi Province and Hailun County in Heilongjiang Province mobilized 65% to 70% of literate people to participate in the work of the illiteracy elimination association.

    Due to the expansion of the teaching force, there are conditions to adopt various learning organization forms suitable for the needs of the masses to meet the learning requirements of the masses. After the establishment of the association in Pengxia Township, Nanping County, Fujian Province, the teaching force was expanded, three more private school classes and thirty-four women's study groups were established, and twenty-four teaching and learning groups were organized, so that all 278 illiterate people in the township participated in the study.

    In addition, many grassroots illiteracy elimination associations in various regions have helped students solve many specific problems in their studies. For example, the illiteracy elimination associations in various townships of Cixian County, Hebei Province, relied on members to mobilize the masses to find 142 rooms for private schools, bought 182 chandeliers, made 162 small blackboards by themselves, and borrowed 1,400 sets of tables and chairs, creating very good conditions for the masses to learn to read.

    However, due to the insufficient understanding of the role of the illiteracy elimination association by some cadres and insufficient mobilization of the masses, and some because the grassroots illiteracy elimination association was not adjusted in time after the merging of townships, some illiteracy elimination associations did not play their role. At present, many places are summarizing experience, improving leadership, and actively studying and deploying this winter's illiteracy elimination work on the basis of the widespread development of illiteracy elimination associations. Beijing, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Shaanxi provinces and cities have notified various regions to combine illiteracy elimination work with the rectification and improvement of grassroots organizations of illiteracy elimination associations, actively develop members, and expand the teaching force. Guangdong Province requires illiteracy elimination associations in various regions to mobilize 60% of literate people to participate in illiteracy elimination work. The Heilongjiang Provincial Illiteracy Elimination Association also focused on going to Zhaodong County and Mudanjiang City to investigate and summarize illiteracy elimination experience.

### 全国二十三个省市成立扫除文盲协会  积极开展扫除文盲工作

    全国二十三个省市成立扫除文盲协会
    积极开展扫除文盲工作
    本报讯　从今年年初开始到目前为止，北京、上海、河北、山西、内蒙古、辽宁、黑龙江、江苏、广东、四川和云南等二十三个省、市，先后建立了扫除文盲协会或扫除文盲协会筹备委员会。大部分省市的县、市与基层乡也普遍建立了扫除文盲协会。
    一年来，各地扫除文盲协会积极协助政府开展扫除文盲工作，并且取得很大成绩。山西、江苏、福建、辽宁、湖北和贵州等省，分别召开了各级扫除文盲协会代表会或扫除文盲干部、农民业余文化学校教师、扫除文盲积极分子会议，推动了扫除文盲工作的开展。
    有的省、市扫除文盲协会还组织扫除文盲协会的委员和有关部门的力量深入下层视察工作。
    各地基层扫除文盲协会在发动群众的基础上发展了会员，动员了识字的人参加扫除文盲工作。如山东省通过扫除文盲协会与扫除文盲工作队动员了三百万农村识字的人参加扫盲工作。山西省新绛县、黑龙江海伦县动员了65％到70％的识字的人参加了扫除文盲协会的工作。
    由于教师队伍的扩大，就有条件采取适合群众需要的、多种多样的学习组织形式，满足群众的学习要求。福建省南平县棚下乡建会后，扩大了教师队伍，多办了三个民校班和三十四个妇女学习小组，另外还组织了二十四个包教保学小组，使全乡二百七十八个文盲全部参加了学习。
    另外，不少地区基层扫除文盲协会，帮助学员解决了学习当中不少的具体问题。例如河北省磁县各乡扫除文盲协会依靠会员，发动群众为民校找出一百四十二间房子，买了一百八十二盏吊灯，自制了一百六十二块小黑板，借了一千四百套桌凳等，为群众识字学习创造了很好的条件。
    但是，由于有些干部对扫除文盲协会的作用认识不足，发动群众不够，有的因为并乡之后，基层扫除文盲协会没有及时调整，所以有的扫除文盲协会没有发挥作用。目前，不少地方已在扫除文盲协会广泛发展的基础上，总结经验，健全领导，积极研究部署今冬的扫除文盲工作。北京、河北、黑龙江、广东、贵州和陕西等省、市，通知各地结合扫除文盲工作，进行整顿与健全扫除文盲协会基层组织，积极发展会员，扩大教师队伍。广东省要求各地扫除文盲协会发动60％识字的人参加扫除文盲工作。黑龙江省扫除文盲协会还重点深入到肇东县、牡丹江市调查、总结了扫除文盲经验。
