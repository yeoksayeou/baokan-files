Affirm Achievements, Expose Shortcomings
Gansu Conducts Comprehensive Inspection of Ethnic Policy Implementation

(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 24th) According to the central government's instructions and plans regarding the inspection of ethnic policy implementation, all regions and departments in Gansu Province have conducted comprehensive inspections. Gansu Province is a multi-ethnic province. In addition to the Han ethnic group, there are also eleven other ethnic groups including the Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Dongxiang, Tu, Yugur, Bonan, Salar, Manchu, Kazakh, and Uyghur, accounting for approximately 11.4% of the province's total population. The inspection reveals that the Party and government's work in minority areas over the past few years has achieved significant results, such as the establishment of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the Wu Zhong, Linxia, and Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefectures, and seven autonomous counties, including the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County. In these areas, more than 10,450 minority cadres have been trained and selected (including 226 cadres at or above the county level), and more than 15,490 Party members have been developed. The socialist transformation of minority agricultural areas has also achieved a decisive victory, with 90% of farmers joining agricultural cooperatives. The economic, cultural, and health undertakings in minority areas have also greatly developed.

The inspection also exposed and criticized various manifestations of Han chauvinism. For example, in areas where ethnic regional autonomy has been implemented, some Han cadres in some organs monopolize work, do not respect or trust minority cadres, and leave minority cadres with positions but no authority. Among the four county heads and deputy county heads of Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, three local ethnic county heads had nothing to do and felt uncomfortable, while one Han deputy county head was too busy every day. Some Han cadres do not respect or even infringe upon the authority of minority cadres. For example, a Party District Committee Secretary (a Han cadre) and a township head of Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County said, "In the future, any issues you want to report must be discussed with me. The district head (a minority cadre) cannot decide anything." There are also many problems in the work of training and promoting minority cadres. Among the 22 members of the Dongxiang County Party Committee, only three are Dongxiang members so far. The Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County Supply and Marketing Cooperative has been short of ten cadres for a long time, but it is unwilling to recruit local ethnic cadres and is waiting for higher authorities to send in outside cadres with education. Some Han leading cadres often nitpick minority cadres based on their lack of business knowledge, inability to use an abacus, low level of education, or even the way they dress. This year, Baihe Xian Township in Dongxiang Autonomous County elected a Dongxiang female township head in the general election, but the county leading organs refused to approve it. Many minority cadres urgently request to join the Party and the League, but the Party and League organizations in some areas are unwilling to approach them more closely; many minority comrades who have joined the Party and the League do not receive regular and timely help and education from the Party and League organizations. In addition, the leading organs in some areas do not sufficiently respect and care for the customs and living habits of minority ethnic groups. For example, when Dunhuang County resettled immigrants from the Sanmenxia Reservoir area in Henan this year, it settled the majority of Han immigrants very well, but neglected the resettlement of a small number of Hui immigrants, which caused great dissatisfaction among some Hui immigrants. Some leading cadres believe that caring for or paying attention to the customs of minority ethnic groups is a manifestation of strong religious consciousness, or even a manifestation of political backwardness. Therefore, they do not seriously solve the practical problems of minority ethnic groups or ethnic cadres in their work and life. For example, the leaders of the Lanzhou Department Store often do not take care of the work and life of Hui cadres, and when they raise opinions, the leaders instead think they are deliberately making things difficult for the leaders. The main reason for these shortcomings is that after the socialist transformation achieved a decisive victory, some cadres developed a sense of complacency and blind self-satisfaction. They only saw the achievements in their work, ignored the shortcomings in their work, neither seriously studied and implemented the Party's ethnic policies, nor listened to the opinions of minority ethnic groups and minority ethnic cadres, and even held the mistaken view that "I am here to support you," which consciously or unconsciously manifested Han chauvinism in their work and violated ethnic policies. At present, the inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies in various regions of the province has not yet ended, and most regions and units are continuing to conduct comprehensive inspections in depth and detail in conjunction with the study of the "Eighth National Congress" documents.

    肯定成绩　揭发缺点
    甘肃全面检查民族政策执行情况
    本报兰州24日电　根据中央发出的关于检查民族政策执行情况的指示和计划，甘肃全省各地区各部门都普遍进行了检查。甘肃省是个多民族的省份，除汉族以外，还有回族、藏族、蒙古族、东乡族、土族、裕固族、保安族、撒拉族、满族、哈萨克族、维吾尔族等十一个民族，约占全省总人口11.4％。从这次检查中看，几年来党和政府在少数民族地区的工作已有显著成绩，如建立了甘南藏族自治州、吴忠、临夏、固原三个回族自治州和天祝藏族、等七个自治县。在这些地区已经培养选拔了少数民族干部一万零四百五十多人（其中县级以上干部二百二十六人）；发展党员一万五千四百九十多人。少数民族农业地区的社会主义改造工作，也已取得了决定性的胜利，90％的农户加入了农业社。少数民族地区的经济文化卫生事业也都有很大的发展。
    在检查中也揭发批判了大汉族主义思想的各种表现。比如，在实行了民族区域自治的地区，有些机关的汉族干部在工作上包办代替不尊重不信任少数民族干部，使少数民族干部有职无权。天祝藏族自治县四个正副县长，其中有三个当地民族县长没事做，觉得难过，而一个汉族副县长却每天忙不过来。有一些汉族干部不尊重甚至侵犯少数民族干部的职权。如天祝藏族自治县一个党的区委书记（汉族干部）和一个乡长说：“以后请示什么问题必须得和我商量，区长（是少数民族干部）决定不了什么问题”。培养和提拔少数民族干部的工作中也存在不少问题。中共东乡县委会二十二个县委委员中，到现在，东乡族的委员仅有三人。天祝藏族自治县供销社很早就缺十个干部，但却不愿吸收当地民族干部，而等待上级派有文化的外来干部。有的汉族领导干部在对待少数民族干部时，往往以不懂业务不会算盘、文化不高甚至以穿衣服不顺眼去挑剔他们。东乡族自治县百和岘乡今年在普选中选出了一名东乡族女乡长，县领导机关却不给批准。许多少数民族干部迫切要求入党入团，但有些地区的党团组织却不愿多接近他们；不少参加了党团的少数民族同志得不到党团组织的经常和及时的帮助教育。还有的地区的领导机关对少数民族的风俗习惯和生活特点不够尊重和照顾。如敦煌县在今年安置河南三门峡水库区移民时，对大多数汉族移民安置得很好，却忽视了对少数回族移民的安置，结果引起一些回族移民很大的不满。有的领导干部认为要照顾或讲究少数民族的风俗习惯，就是宗教意识浓厚的表现，甚至认为是政治上的落后的表现。因此就不去认真解决少数民族或民族干部在工作和生活上的实际问题。如兰州市百货公司领导上经常不照顾回族干部的工作和生活，而当他们提出意见时，领导上反而认为他们故意和领导上为难。发生这些缺点的主要原因是在社会主义改造取得了决定性胜利之后，部分干部产生了居功骄傲盲目自满情绪。他们只看到了工作中的成绩，忽视了工作中的缺点，既不认真研究和贯彻党的民族政策，也不倾听少数民族和少数民族干部的意见，甚至还抱着一种“我是来扶持你们的”的错误观点，这样就在工作中自觉或不自觉地表现出大汉族主义，违犯民族政策。目前全省各地区对民族政策执行情况的检查尚未结束，多数地区和单位正在结合“八大”文件的学习，继续深入地细致地进行全面的检查。
