Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 15th. The Yellow River Basin Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference, convened by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, concluded yesterday in Zhengzhou after seven days.

The conference summarized the basic experiences of the great development of soil and water conservation work over the past year and put forward tasks for the coming year. In 1957, the seven provinces and regions of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia in the Yellow River Basin plan to control soil erosion in an area of 25,900 square kilometers. This is a slight reduction from the 1956 plan, but it ensures a focus. Next year, approximately 80% of the area controlled will be in the Wuding River, Jing River, and Wei River basins, the Yellow River tributaries with the most severe soil erosion.

Based on existing experience, the conference unanimously agreed that by implementing the policy of "overall planning, comprehensive development, combining gully and slope treatment, concentrated management, active development, and steady progress," and grasping the principle of adapting to local conditions, a movement of "terracing slopes, transforming gullies into plains, irrigating plains, and afforesting barren mountains and slopes" can be carried out on the basis of first developing agriculture. This can gradually lead to the development of the economy in mountainous areas in many aspects, including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. Judging from the discussions at the conference, the current concern is how to achieve better coordination among the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy departments in soil and water conservation work. Experience has shown that if forests are not planted and measures suitable for mountainous areas are not taken after building embankments and terraces, the field projects on the hillsides alone will not effectively control soil erosion and increase production. Therefore, establishing unified leadership in the work of various departments within a mountainous area is necessary.

Based on existing experience, the conference believes that soil and water conservation work should generally be carried out in small watersheds, from upstream to downstream, from small gullies to large gullies, treating slopes and branch gullies first, and then treating main gullies, for concentrated management and comprehensive development of slopes and gullies. It is required to manage one slope, complete one slope, and consolidate one slope; manage one gully and consolidate one gully. At the same time, it is also necessary to actively manage the main gullies with great benefits for comprehensive utilization to cooperate with the tributary management and the Sanmenxia Reservoir project. The conference particularly emphasized the concentrated management of soil and water conservation, because agricultural cooperativization provides various conveniences for concentrated management. The conference believes that to do a good job in soil and water conservation, which is a work of transforming nature, it is necessary to strengthen scientific experimentation and research, promote mature soil and water conservation experience, scientifically summarize the existing experience of the masses, and train technical cadres through visits, learning, and short-term training courses.

The conference pointed out that soil and water conservation is a long-term construction work. Therefore, the organization of labor should not be too large or too broad; labor should be planned comprehensively and the policy of distribution according to work should be implemented without affecting agricultural production. Only by correctly combining the long-term interests and immediate interests of farmers can the enthusiasm of the masses be brought into play and this arduous task be gradually completed.

The conference exchanged views on the planning of the "Twelve-Year Soil and Water Conservation Work Plan for the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River."

### 黄河流域水土保持工作会议决定  统一领导加强水土保持工作

    黄河流域水土保持工作会议决定
    统一领导加强水土保持工作
    新华社郑州15日电　黄河水利委员会召开的黄河流域水土保持工作会议，历时七天，昨天在郑州闭幕。
    这次会议总结了一年来水土保持工作大发展中的基本经验，并且提出了下一年度的任务。1957年，黄河流域的陕西、甘肃、山西、河南、山东、青海和内蒙古七个省区，共计划控制水土流失面积两万五千九百平方公里。这比1956年的计划有了适当的收缩，但是保证了重点。明年，在水土流失最严重的黄河支流无定河、泾河、渭河流域，控制的面积占全年计划的80％左右。
    会议根据已有的经验，一致认为：执行“全面规划，综合开发，沟坡兼治，集中治理，积极发展，稳步前进”的方针，掌握因地制宜的原则，在首先发展农业的基础上，开展“坡地梯田化，沟地川台化，川地水利化，荒山荒坡绿化”运动，可以逐步使山区的农、林、牧和副业等多方面的经济，都得到发展。从会议的讨论情况中看来，现在大家关心的问题是在水土保持工作中，农业、林业和水利部门之间要取得更好的配合。因为经验证明，培了地埂，修了梯田，如果不植林，不采取适合山区的措施，只靠山坡里的田间工程，仍然不能有效地控制水土流失和增加生产。所以在一个山区之内，建立各部门工作的统一领导，是必要的。
    根据已有的经验，会议认为，水土保持工作一般应该以小流域为单位，先由上游到下游，由小沟到大沟，先治坡面和支毛沟，后治干沟，成坡成沟的集中治理，综合开发。要求治一坡，成一坡，巩固一坡；治一沟，巩固一沟。同时，也要积极治理对综合利用效益大的干沟，以配合支流治理和三门峡水库工程。会议特别强调水土保持的集中治理，因为农业的合作化给集中治理提供了各种便利条件。会议认为，把水土保持这项改造自然的工作做好，必须加强科学试验研究，推广成熟的水土保持经验，科学地总结群众已有的经验，并且用参观学习和开办短期训练班的办法来培养技术干部。
    会议指出，水土保持是一项长期的建设工作，因此劳动力的组织就不能偏大、偏宽；要在不影响农业生产的情况下，全面规划劳动力，贯彻按劳取酬政策。只有把农民的长远利益和眼前利益正确地结合起来，才能发挥群众的积极性，逐步完成这一艰巨事业。
    这次会议对于编制“黄河中游十二年水土保持工作规划”的计划方面，交换了意见。
