    Suez Canal Clearing Work to be Carried Out in Three Stages
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th - A United Nations salvage team began clearing operations at the southern entrance of the Suez Canal at 12:15 local time on December 29th.

    Egyptian Intelligence Director Hatem announced the commencement of the canal clearing operation that evening, stating that the work would be divided into three stages: marking obstacles, dismantling obstacles, and retrieving dismantled objects from the canal.

    He added that clearing work would be carried out simultaneously in all sections of the canal. Technicians have divided the canal into three sections: from Suez to Ismailia, from Ismailia to Fidan, and from Fidan to Port Said.

    Hatem also said that an agreement on clearing the canal had been reached between UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi, and that this agreement had already come into effect. He said that reports in foreign newspapers to the contrary were Anglo-French propaganda.

    新华社30日讯　开罗消息：联合国的一个打捞队在12月29日当地时间十二点十五分在苏伊士运河的南口开始进行清理工作。
    埃及情报司长哈特姆当天晚上在宣布运河清理工作开始的时候说，这项工作将分三个阶段进行，这就是标志障碍物、把障碍物拆散，从运河中捞起拆散的物件。
    他又说，清理工作将在运河各段同时进行。技术人员已经把运河分成从苏伊士到伊士美利亚、从伊士美利亚到费丹、从费丹到塞得港三段。
    哈特姆还说，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和埃及外交部长法齐之间已经达成了清理运河的协议，这种协议已经生效。他说，外国报纸上的同这一情况相反的报道是英法的宣传。
