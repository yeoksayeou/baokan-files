Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, December 3rd: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long visited the Indian Navy's flagship "Delhi" and the Bombay Naval Dockyard this afternoon.

　　Rear Admiral R.D. Katari of the Indian Fleet welcomed them before they boarded the naval barge.
　　A few minutes later, Zhou Enlai and He Long arrived at the Naval Dockyard. They toured the dockyard.
　　Subsequently, they boarded the Indian Navy warship "Delhi," which was docked at the pier. The honor guard lined up on the deck of the warship presented arms, and the military band played the national anthems of China and India.
　　Admiral Katari, the most senior officer in the Indian Navy, stepped forward and shook hands with Zhou Enlai. Captain Samson, the captain of the "Delhi," and Lieutenant Commander Barua, the first officer, were introduced to Premier Zhou.
　　The guests had tea and conversed with many naval officers on the flagship.
　　Naval officers brought out their notebooks and asked Premier Zhou to sign them as souvenirs. When the naval officers told the Premier that they were asking for signatures "for our children," Zhou Enlai said in English, "What good fathers you are." Everyone laughed.
　　As the guests left the flagship, the band played the national anthems of China and India, and the Indian naval officers saluted.
Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, December 3rd: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their party, followed by a large number of news-hungry reporters, drove through the working-class residential area of Parel in Bombay to the Spring Textile Factory today. They were warmly cheered by countless working men and women of Bombay gathered on the streets.
　　This factory has 137,000 spindles and is one of the largest textile factories in India. As the guests toured the factory from one department to another, they were cheered by the workers everywhere. Premier Zhou Enlai responded to their cheers with a gesture of palms together, in the Indian manner. In another department, cheering female workers surrounded Vice Premier He Long and took photos with him. The guests also visited the factory's nursery and medical clinic.
　　After Premier Zhou Enlai tasted the simple meal in the workers' canteen, he said, "Very good."
　　After leaving the textile factory, they drove along a three-mile road lined with cheerful welcomers, and through the Bombay suburbs, where coconut trees were planted everywhere, to the Indian Atomic Energy Agency.
　　The swimming pool-type reactor project in this agency was built by Indian scientists and engineers. Director Homi J. Bhabha led the Chinese guests to visit various places and explained the technical details. Bhabha also guided them to the site where another reactor was being built. He said that India would have six or seven atomic reactors by the end of another five-year plan.
　　Later, the guests visited a dairy farm with 15,000 cows.
　　Premier Zhou Enlai also planted a sapling. As a symbol of friendship between China and India, the dairy farm workers responded with warm applause. The saplings planted by Bulganin and Khrushchev during their visit here last year are now growing well.
　　Premier Zhou Enlai left the dairy farm amidst workers waving bouquets and shouting the slogan "Hindi-Chini bhai bhai" (Indians and Chinese are brothers).

　　周总理贺副总理在孟买参观访问
    据新华社孟买3日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理今天下午参观了印度海军的旗舰“德里号”和孟买的海军造船厂。
    印度舰队鲁·德·卡塔里海军少将在他们登上海军驳船前欢迎他们。
    几分钟以后，周恩来和贺龙到达海军造船厂。他们参观了这个造船厂。
    随后，他们登上停泊在码头的印度海军军舰“德里号”，排列在军舰甲板上的仪仗队举枪致敬，军乐队奏中国和印度的国歌。
    印度海军中资历最高的一位军官、卡塔里海军上将，上前和周恩来握手。“德里号”舰长萨姆森海军上校和大副巴鲁阿海军中校被介绍给周总理。
    来宾们在旗舰上同许多海军军官一起吃茶和交谈。
    海军军官们拿出了笔记本，要求周总理签名留念。当海军军官们对总理说他们是为“我们的孩子们”要求签名留念时，周恩来用英文说：“你们是多么好的父亲”。大家都笑了。
    当来宾们离开旗舰时，乐队奏中印两国国歌，印度海军官兵们致敬礼。
    据新华社孟买3日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理等一行今天在大批渴求新闻的记者们跟随下，乘车通过孟买帕雷尔的工人居住区去斯普林纺织工厂的时候，受到聚集在街头的无数孟买劳动男女的热烈欢呼。
    这个工厂拥有十三万七千纱锭，它是印度最大的纺织厂之一。当客人们在工厂里从一个部门到另一个部门参观时，他们到处受到工人们的欢呼。周恩来总理照印度人的习惯用合十礼来回答他们的欢呼。在另一个部门里，欢呼的女工们围住了贺龙副总理，并且同他一起拍了照。来宾们还参观了这个工厂的托儿所和医务所。
    周恩来总理在工人食堂里尝了一下简单的饭以后说，“很好”。
    他们在从这座纺织厂出来以后，就乘车通过一条两旁站满了兴高采烈的欢迎者的三英里长的道路，以及到处栽着椰子树的孟买郊区，到达印度的原子能机构。
    这个机构中的游泳池式的反应堆工程是印度科学家和工程师建造的。所长霍·杰·巴巴引着中国贵宾们到各处参观，并且解释了技术上的细节问题。巴巴还引导他们到正在建造另一座反应堆的地方参观。他说，印度在另一个五年计划结束时，将有六、七座原子反应堆。
    后来，客人们到有一万五千头奶牛的牛奶场参观。
    周恩来总理还种植了一棵树苗。作为中印两国之间的友谊的象征，牛奶场工人们报以热烈的鼓掌。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫去年在这里访问时种植的树苗，现在已经生长得很好了。
    周恩来总理在男女工人挥舞着花束和高呼“印地秦尼巴依巴依”口号声中，离开这个牛奶场。
