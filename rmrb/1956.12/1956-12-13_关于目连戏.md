    About the Mulian Opera
    Chang Nian

    I read Comrade Chen Shan's article in the People's Daily recently and learned that "Mulian Saves His Mother" is being performed in Shanghai. As a Shaoxing person who loves Mulian Opera, this is very gratifying. It is necessary to explain that this Mulian Opera is a very special kind of folk drama. It has many shortcomings, but it also has its own strengths. It is a religious drama, with a gloomy and backward side, but at the same time it is also very bright and full of humor. The content of the play is very simple, just saving the mother from hell. The beginning, where Mother Fu commits sins, is just a necessary explanation. The play itself takes seven days and seven nights to perform, which is due to the many interludes in the middle, depicting many situations in society as seen by Mulian along the way, and performing humorous and satirical scenes. Furthermore, this is a purely folk amateur drama. In the past, there were no fixed actors. It was just a temporary troupe formed by farmers and workers, and they would disband after the performance. Everything was "put together," so the costumes were also very poor. The Shaoxing saying "Mulian attire" is used to describe old and ragged clothes, and it comes from this. In short, this genre is very special and worthy of preservation, research, and reorganization. But this is not easy. If you don't fully understand its characteristics and just idealistically start to reorganize it, you may easily repeat the mistakes of some drama revisions and become a joke like using splints to treat a hunchback.
    From my personal point of view, this is a religious drama that promotes good deeds. If we want to fundamentally transform it and generate any positive effects, it is probably impossible in reality. In order to preserve this special folk drama, we can only passively prevent its possible harms, such as eating vegetarian food and chanting Buddhist scriptures, and sponsoring monks and building temples. We should regard the story of saving the mother as a framework to hang up those miscellaneous interludes. In other words, we should downplay the section where Mother Fu commits sins and goes to hell, with the aim of leading out Mulian. We don't need to overemphasize Mother Fu's anti-religious aspect, because Mulian always thought that his mother should be saved, and in the end he finally saved her, which already indicates recognition of Mother Fu's actions. If it is originally a religious drama that promotes good deeds, but we want to forcefully reverse it and turn it into an anti-religious (Buddhist) drama, this 180-degree turn is probably not easy. Moreover, in this era where the superstition of eating vegetarian food, chanting Buddhist scriptures, and sponsoring monks and building temples is not prevalent, such propaganda would be somewhat akin to tilting at windmills.
    The second characteristic of Mulian Opera, as I said, is its comedic nature. I think Chinese people have always loved comedy. This broad sense of comedy is found in the happy endings of novels and operas. Some masterpieces with tragic endings, such as "Romance of the West Chamber" and "Dream of the Red Chamber," will definitely have sequels written to make them end happily. In the old days, no matter what troupe it was, at the end of a daytime or evening performance in Shaoxing opera, no matter what play was performed at the end, after the characters entered the stage, a male and female character would definitely come out and bow to each other in front of the stage, while happy music was played in the background, and the audience would prepare to leave. This seems a bit vulgar, but I think it is very commendable, because it shows the bright character of the Chinese people, who love peace and happiness. There is also comedy in the narrow sense, with humorous characters and witty words and actions, which are also quite rich in drama and folk art, and I think this is also very good. The interludes, which occupy nine-tenths of the entire Mulian Opera, are almost all dramatized jokes and satirical paintings of society and family. This can be said to be the essence of Mulian Opera, and it is precisely because of these that ordinary people like to watch it, and it also dilutes the atmosphere of a religious drama that promotes good deeds, because I think ordinary people do not like to listen to sermons that promote good deeds. If the reorganization emphasizes the Fu family's affairs and changes it into a complete "Story of Saving the Mother," no matter how good the artistic skills are and how great the role of anti-superstition is, it is, after all, a "buying the casket and returning the pearl" approach, and Mulian Opera is just an empty shell. I last saw it fifty years ago on the stage in the road pavilion in front of Changqing Temple, and it only lasted half a day and a night, so many interludes were omitted, and most of them have been forgotten, but some are still vaguely remembered, such as "Mud Workers Building a Wall," "Zhang Man Beating His Father," and also someone working as a hired laborer for a landlord, initially agreeing that carrying water would cost sixteen coins per load, but later, for some reason, it became one coin for sixteen loads. Another example is that the hall of a rich family hung a banner with an obscene poem that began with "The sun rises red and puffy," which was also full of satire, although if it were to be reorganized, this section would naturally have to be deleted or revised. I think that the work of reorganizing for preservation should not be too hasty. The usual lesson of "not seeking merit, but seeking no demerit" is not a good principle, but it seems to be applicable here. We should respect the creative processing of the common people and preserve those small comedic interludes as much as possible, and rather greatly abbreviate the main plot (i.e., the Fu family's affairs), as long as it is enough to be used as a framework, and hang more interludes on it. Now that it is impossible to perform for several days in a row, it seems that it would be possible to separate the preserved number of interludes and freely insert them to provide for a one-day performance. I am completely an amateur in drama, but I know a little about the nature of Mulian Opera and feel that preservation and reorganization are really necessary, and that improper reorganization will destroy this genre. As good as Western drama history and theory may be, when applied to China, especially special folk arts, it is very important to be cautious and not apply them all. It is necessary to humbly understand and adopt the opinions of local artists who create, process, and even perform this genre. Avoid engaging in it based on subjectivity and dogmatism, because if it is not done well, this originally dying patient may die under the knife. I don't understand everything about drama and am not qualified to talk about these issues, but as a Shaoxing person, this does not count as one of the hundreds of schools of thought, but it is still a qualification, and I am coming out to say a few words for Mulian Opera for reference.

    关于目连戏
    长年
    在近日人民日报上见到陈山同志的文章，知道“目连救母”在上海演出，在爱好目连戏的一个绍兴人看来，这是一件很可喜的事情。不必要地说明一句，这目连戏是民间戏剧的很特别的一种，它有好许多的缺点，但也自有其长处。它是一部宗教性的戏，有阴沉的落后的一面，但同时也很明朗，富于诙谐。戏的内容极简单，只是救母出地狱。起头傅母造孽，只是必要的说明。戏的本身须得七天七夜才能演完，乃是中间许多插曲，作为目连一路所见，描写出社会上的许多情形，演出滑稽讽刺的场面。还有一层，这是纯粹的民间业余剧，以前并无一定演员，只是由农人、工人临时凑搭成班，演完就散，一切都是“凑合”，所以服装也很差。绍兴俗语有“目连行头”一语，形容破旧衣服，即从此出。——总起来说，这剧种是很特别的，值得保存研究，加以整理的。但是这很不容易，如不充分了解它的特质，只是理想地去下手整理，容易蹈了有些戏改的复辙，成为夹板医治驼背的笑话。
    据我个人的看法来说，这是一个劝善的宗教剧，我们要想根本上来改造它，发生什么积极的作用，那在事实上恐怕是不可能的。我们为的要保存这特别的民间剧，只好来消极地防止它可能的弊害，例如吃素念佛，斋僧修庙的事。我们应该把救母的事当作一个架子，来挂起那些杂多的插曲，换句话说便是要把傅母造孽下地狱这一节轻描淡写地对付过去，目的只是去引出目连来。傅母反宗教的一点不必太去强调它，因为目连始终以为母亲当救，末了也终于救了出来，这就已经表示对于傅母的是认了。若本是宗教劝善剧，却要用力去扭转过来，变为反宗教（佛教）的戏剧，这一百八十度的转变怕不是容易的事，而且在现今吃素念佛、斋僧修庙的迷信并不盛行的时代，要如此宣传，也未免有点近于无的放矢吧。
    目连戏的第二特点，我说过那是它的喜剧性。我觉得中国人向来就爱好喜剧。这广义的喜剧是发现于小说戏曲的大团圆的收场。有些悲剧收场的杰作，如西厢记与红楼梦，一定有人要续作，使得它团圆为止。旧时绍兴戏不管是什么班，在日场或夜场完结的时候，不管末了演的是什么戏，在脚色进场之后，必定出来一生一旦，在台前交拜，后台奏着喜乐，观众便预备走散了。这似乎有点庸俗，但我觉得却很有可取，因为这表示中国人民的明朗的性格，爱好和平快乐。还有狭义的喜剧，滑稽的脚色和诙谐的言动，在戏剧与民间艺术上也相当丰富，这我也以为是很好的。占据目连全剧十分之九地位的插曲，差不多都是一个个剧化的笑话，社会家庭的讽刺画。这可以说是目连戏的精华部分，也正因为这些使得老百姓喜欢看，也冲淡了劝善的宗教剧的空气，因为据我想，老百姓是并不爱听劝善的说教的。如果整理时强调了傅家的事情，改成一出完全的“救母记”，无论艺术工夫多么好，反迷信的作用多么大，总之是“买椟还珠”的作法，目连戏只是一个躯壳罢了。我还是五十年前在长庆寺前的路亭台上看过最后的一次，只演了半日一夜，所以插曲省去了不少，大部分也已忘记了，但是有些还约略记得，如“泥水作打墙”，“张蛮打爹”，还如什么人给地主当佣工，当初说定挑水是十六文一担，后来不知怎么一来，变成了一文十六担了。又如说富家中堂挂着条幅，中写“太阳出起红澎澎”一首猥亵的诗，也满是讽刺的意思，虽然如要整理，这一段自然也只好删改了。我以为为了保存而整理的工作不可太急进，平常
  “不求有功，但求无过”的教训不足为法，但在这里却似乎是可以合用的。我们要尊重老百姓的创意的加工，尽可能保留那些小喜剧的插曲，宁可把主要的情节（即傅家的事情）多多节略，只要足够当作架子用就好，却把插曲多挂上去。现在不可能接连的演好几天，似乎不妨将保留的多少插曲各个拆开，自由地编插进去，以供一天的演出。我对于戏剧完全是外行，但是知道一点目连戏的性质，觉得保存整理实为必要，而整理的不得法，反要把这剧种毁掉了。西洋的戏剧史和戏剧理论尽管好，用到中国来时，特别是民间特种艺术，却很要慎重，不能全部拿来应用，须要虚心了解并采纳创造以至演出这剧种的地方艺人的意见。切忌凭主观和教条来从事，弄得不好时，这本来奄奄一息的病人会得死于手术之下的。我不懂一切戏剧，本来不配来谈这些问题，只是以绍兴人的资格，这算不得是百家之一，但也总是一种资格，出来替目连戏说两句话，以供参考。
