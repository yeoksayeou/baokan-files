A Farce
Tan Wenrui

As the last batch of French invading troops limped out of Egypt, French commander General Beaufre thought it necessary to seize this rare opportunity to provide the world with some more laughs. He staged a brilliant farce on the deck of the "Claude Bernard": reading a statement bidding farewell to the Egyptian people. This statement, filled with upside-down black and white phrases, was more laughable than hateful. However, if some narration were added, I am afraid that the stage effect of this farce would be even more "icing on the cake." Therefore, the author, without presuming to be presumptuous and without the consent of the playwright and actor General Beaufre, dared to embellish the script slightly. The original lines were not changed at all, only some narration was added.

Time: December 22, 1956

Setting: The deck of the French ship "Claude Bernard" anchored in Port Fouad, Egypt.

Characters: General Beaufre and thousands of listless but gleeful French invading officers and soldiers.

Curtain opens: General Beaufre, trying his best to imitate Napoleon's posture, stands on the bow, facing the shore (where the Egyptian flag is flying), holding a page of declaration in his right hand. You can see his hand shaking. The general coughed twice and began to read the statement in a solemn voice that was clearly artificial (the roar of "Invaders get out!" coming from afar became the accompaniment to this "recitation"):

"We came to Egypt to stop the war between Israel and your country (Narration: Damn, the whole world already knows that we instigated Israel to launch the attack, and our air force also participated in the Israeli army's attack on the Sinai Peninsula) and protect the canal area. (Narration: Due to the bombing and destruction by us and our allies, the canal cannot be opened to navigation for a year and a half).

"Your ignorant government ignored our generous proposals and forced us to fight. (Narration: It is our Mollet government that is ignorant. If we had known that armed aggression was useless, why didn't we accept the Egyptian government's generous proposal and force us to fight. As a result, we suffered such a shameful end today.)

"The Nasser government, despite its big talk, has proved itself incapable of confronting us. (Narration: It is our government and the British government that are talking big. They said that they could subdue Egypt in a few days, but in fact, the residents of Port Said alone gave us enough trouble.)

"You have seen it with your own eyes. Israel has been stopped. (Narration: We have also been stopped.) The war stopped quickly. (Narration: If the war doesn't stop, I'm afraid it will be difficult for us to leave alive.)

"The Nasser government only succeeded in doing one thing: it blocked the canal on which you depend for your survival. (Narration: The canal was not blocked before we launched the invasion. It can be seen that blocking the canal is the only thing we succeeded in doing.) As soon as we arrived, we began salvaging the ships that the criminals had sunk in the canal. (Narration: It is not good to use the word "criminals", because world opinion accuses us of being war criminals. But we did salvage the canal, because we thought we could occupy the canal for a long time.)

"Today we are leaving because we have always decided to leave once the UN forces become strong enough. (Narration: To be honest, it is the powerful force of world justice that made us have to get out.) We are leaving on the day and at the hour that we chose a long time ago. (Narration: This is nonsense, just a short while ago, we wanted to find an excuse to stay put, but we didn't succeed.)

"We wish you all happiness and prosperity.
(Narration: There is no way to deny that our armed aggression has destroyed the happiness and prosperity of the Egyptian people.) We sincerely hope that you will be able to get rid of that one conspiracy that threatens the Arab world and the Muslim world: the conspiracy planned by communism. (Narration: If I remember correctly, all Arab countries have openly accused us of being their common enemy. And most Arab countries deny that they are threatened by any "communism.")

"In order to prevent you from becoming victims, France is still ready to do tomorrow what it did yesterday." (Narration: The word "prevent" should be removed. We have indeed not abandoned the plan to make a comeback, because you all know that invaders rarely accept the lessons of failure.) (Curtain falls)

    一幕滑稽剧
    谭文瑞
    在最后一批法国侵略军队灰溜溜地滚出埃及的时候，法军司令博弗雷尔将军竟然认为有必要抓住这个难得的机会再给世人提供一些笑料，他在“克洛德·伯纳尔号”的船头上演了一幕精采的丑剧：宣读了一篇向埃及人民告别的声明。这篇充满着颠倒黑白的词句的声明，如其说令人憎恨，不如说使人发笑。不过如果再加一些旁白，恐怕这幕滑稽剧的舞台效果会更加“锦上添花”。因此，作者不揣冒昧，没有得到编剧兼演员博弗雷尔将军的同意，敢把脚本略加润色。原来台词一字未易，只不过增添了一些旁白而已。
    时间：1956年12月22日
    布景：停泊在埃及福德港的法国船“克洛德·伯纳尔号”的船面上。
    人物：博弗雷尔将军和上千的没精打采而又面有喜色的法国侵略军官兵。
    启幕：博弗雷尔将军极力仿照拿破仑的姿势，站在船头，面朝着岸上（那边飘扬着埃及国旗），右手拿着一页声明稿。可以看到他的手在发抖。将军咳嗽了两声，开始用显然是造作的庄严的声音宣读声明（从远处传来的“侵略者滚出去！”的怒吼，成为这场“朗诵”的伴奏）： 
     “我们到埃及来，是为了制止以色列和你们的国家之间的战争（旁白：见鬼，全世界都已经知道是我们鼓动以色列发动进攻的，我们的空军还参加了以色列军队进攻西奈半岛的战斗）和保护运河地区的。（旁白：由于我们和我们盟军的轰炸破坏，运河一年半载不能通航）。
    “你们的愚昧无知的政府没有理睬我们慷慨的提议，还强迫我们作战，（旁白：愚昧无知的是我们的摩勒政府，如果早知武装侵略毫无用处，何不接受埃及政府的慷慨建议而要强迫我们作战。结果遭到了今天这样可耻的下场。）
    “纳赛尔政府尽管说大话，但是它却证明了它自己是无力同我们对抗的。（旁白：是我们和英国的政府说大话，它们说过几天内就能使埃及屈服，而事实上单是塞得港的居民就把我们搞得够呛。）
    “你们已经亲眼看到了。以色列被制止了，（旁白：我们也被制止了。）战争很快地停了下来。（旁白：战争再不停，恐怕我们就难活着离开了。）
    “纳赛尔政府只做成功了一件事情：它阻塞了你们赖以生存的运河。（旁白：在我们发动侵略前，运河并没有被阻塞。可见阻塞运河是我们做成功的唯一的一件事情。）我们刚一到达就开始打捞罪犯们凿沉在运河里的那些船只。（旁白：用“罪犯”这个词颇为不妙，因为各国舆论都指责我们是战争罪犯。不过我们确曾经打捞过运河，因为我们还以为能够长期把运河占领下去的。）
    “今天我们离开了，因为我们一向决定一旦联合国部队变成足够强有力的时候，我们就离开。（旁白：说实话是世界道义力量的强有力使我们不得不滚蛋的。）我们是在我们很久以前就已经选定的那个日子和那个时辰离开。（旁白：这才是鬼话，就在不久以前，我们还想找词死赖不走呢，不过没有成功罢了。）
    “我们祝你们大家幸福繁荣。
  （旁白：没法不承认，是我们的武装侵略破坏了埃及人民的幸福繁荣。）我们十分希望你们能够摆脱那个唯一的威胁着阿拉伯世界和穆斯林世界的阴谋：共产主义所策划阴谋。（旁白：如果我没有记错的话，所有阿拉伯国家都公开指责我们是它们共同的敌人。而且多数阿拉伯国家都否认它们受到什么“共产主义威胁”。）
    “为了使你们不致成为受害者，法国仍然准备着要在明天做它昨天做过的事情。”（旁白：应该把“不致”二字去掉才对。我们倒的确没有抛弃卷土重来的打算，因为你们都知道侵略者从来就很少会接受失败的教训。）（幕下）
