    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 26th: According to the Indonesian News Agency, Lieutenant Colonel Barlian, commander of the Second Military District of South Sumatra, remains loyal to the government. So far, the attempts by certain political groups to incite him to betray the government have failed. The commander resolutely stated a few days ago that he would continue to be loyal to the government and the army leaders in Jakarta.
    The Governor of South Sumatra Province, Winarno Danuatmodjo, said at a press conference held in Palembang on the 24th that popular discontent should not be channeled into "actions such as military coups." He announced that the provincial public security organs would hold a special meeting to deal with any unexpected events that might occur in South Sumatra.
    The news said that the Indonesian Independence Defenders Organization had instructed Dahlan Ibrahim, Minister of State for Veterans Affairs, who belongs to this party, to withdraw from the coalition cabinet. Ibrahim said that at today's cabinet meeting he would suggest that the government return the mandate to the head of state. Today's cabinet meeting accepted Ibrahim's resignation and appointed Idham Chalid, Second Deputy Prime Minister of the cabinet and a member of the Islamic Teachers Association, to concurrently serve as Minister of State for Veterans Affairs.
    The news also said that sources close to the Army General Staff said today that due to the "serious" current domestic situation and the takeover of power by the military district commanders of Central Sumatra and North Sumatra, all armed forces personnel have been ordered to stop taking leave. Army, Navy, Air Force, and police personnel on leave have been ordered to return to their camps as soon as possible.

    南苏门答腊省军政首脑表示拥护政府
    新华社雅加达26日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社消息：南苏门答腊的第二军区司令巴利安中校仍然忠于政府。直到现在为止，某些政治集团促使他背叛政府的企图都遭到了失败。这位司令在几天前曾坚决表示继续效忠政府和雅加达的陆军领袖。
    南苏门答腊省省长威纳诺·达努阿莫佐24日在巨港举行的记者招待会上说，不应当把人民当中的不满情绪引导到“军事政变之类的行动”上去。他宣布说，省的公安机关将要召开特别会议以应付在南苏门答腊可能发生的任何意外事件。
    消息说，印度尼西亚独立保卫者组织已经指示属于这个党的退伍军人事务国务部长达赫兰·易卜拉欣退出联合内阁。易卜拉欣说，在今天的内阁会议上他将要建议政府把委任状退还给国家元首。今天的内阁会议接受了易卜拉欣的辞呈，并委任属于伊斯兰教师联合会的内阁第二副总理伊德汉·查利德兼任退伍军人事务国务部长。
    消息还说，接近陆军参谋部的人士今天说，由于目前国内的局势“严重”以及中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊军区司令接管了政权，所有武装部队人员一律停止休假。已经命令在休假中的陆、海、空军和警察人员尽快回他们的营地。
