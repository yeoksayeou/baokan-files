　　In the Restaurant
　　Soviet Union　Sai Zhaliejin
    Cold… Darkness… The streetlights are not dim, but they don't illuminate the whole street. The darkness and the light of the streetlights intertwine and change, sometimes close, sometimes far away. One moment it appears in the light, the next it disappears in the darkness. People, horses, donkeys move on the asphalt road…
    The man has a towel wrapped around his head, and a knot tied around his neck. With each step he takes, the two tails of the knot swing up and down. He walks quickly, constantly waving his whip. In this street that is like a crack in the stone, covered by a black sky, a gun-like, low sound rings out, each sound sudden and startling…
    The horse and donkey pull a large cart, which is made of wood and has two huge wheels. The horse takes steady and calm steps, paying no attention to the carter's shouts and conversations, even though those words reveal a weak mockery. Whenever the whip cracks in the air, the donkey only slightly twitches its ears, taking one or two steps forward, or to the left. The donkey takes two steps for every one step the horse takes. Its head droops, with two ears standing upright. Because its belly is very large, its legs seem particularly thin. Its whole body, its every move, shows that it is using its strength… It looks at the asphalt road below, at the small hooves that are about to step on it. This gaze is focused, concentrated. As if the donkey stubbornly holds a hope, wanting to find a blade of grass on this cold asphalt road, and pull it up in one bite. The donkey flutters its nostrils, perhaps it smells the fragrance of cabbage… The cart, heavily loaded with cabbage, creaks and groans, the sound uneven, sometimes thin, sometimes thick, sometimes very low, while the donkey, horse, and man sometimes disappear into the darkness, sometimes appear in the light. At this time, the three of them cast a fantastic shadow on the asphalt road… In this strange shadow, nothing can be seen except for three heads, the donkey's head with two large ears, the horse's head with pointed ears, and the man's head with two ears as well, which are the knots of the towel tied around his neck…
    The man cursed the horse and donkey twice, tightened the knot around his neck, then put the towing rope on his shoulder, leaning his body forward, and began to drag the creaking cart again… His empty hand still raised the whip as before, making cracking sounds next to the animals' heads… The horse's ears trembled, the donkey lowered its head even further… Sparse, cold snowflakes are falling…
    The streetlights shine brightly… The cabbage carried by the man in the cart, the horse and donkey, can smell the scent of soil and sunshine… and the smell of horse sweat.
    These smells are now combined into one smell, which cannot be named, nor is there anything similar to compare it with. But this smell can be recognized…
    Everything I have written here is what I saw in a flash when crossing the streets of Beijing at night. I saw it, but didn't pay attention, seeing the scene only for a moment, and then forgetting it…
    However, the next day, when I was having lunch in a large restaurant, I suddenly smelled this familiar smell in a very tasty dish…
    I smelled this smell, and the scene immediately appeared before my eyes…

    在饭店里
　　苏联　塞·扎雷金
    寒冷……黑暗……街灯的光芒并不暗淡，但没有照亮全街，黑暗和街灯的亮光时而近、时而远地交织变换，一会儿它出现在光亮的地方，一会儿又在黑暗中消失。人、马、驴子在柏油路上移动……
    那人的头上包着毛巾，脖子上扎了个结子，每走一步，结子的两条尾巴就上下摇动。他走得很快，不断挥着鞭子。在这好似石缝一样的、上面罩着黑色天空的街上，传出枪响似的、低沉的声音，每响一下都是那样突然，那样令人惊悸……
    马和驴子拖着一辆大车，大车是木制的，有两个巨大的轮子。马迈着沉着而安详的步子，对赶车人的吆喝与谈话毫不在意，虽然那些话里透露着有气无力的嘲笑。每当鞭子在空中叭哒叫响的时候，驴子只微微耸一耸耳朵，向前面，或者是向左边迈进一两步。马走一步，驴子要走两步。它下垂的脑袋上面，竖着两只耳朵。由于它的肚腹非常肥大，几只腿子便显得特别细。它的整个身子，它的一举一动，都说明它在使用力气……它看着下面的柏油路，看着小小的蹄子立刻就要踏着的地方。这目光是集中的、全神贯注的。仿佛驴子固执地抱着一个希望，想在这寒冷的柏油路上寻得一株青草，一嘴把它拔起来。驴子扇动着鼻孔，也许它嗅到了白菜的芳香……那沉沉地装满白菜的大车，叽叽吱吱地叫着，声音很不匀称，一会儿尖细，一会儿粗壮，一会儿又很低沉，而驴子、马、人一会儿隐没在黑暗里面，一会儿又出现在灯光照耀的地方。到了这时，他们三个便给柏油路投上一道奇幻的影子……这奇怪的影子里，除了三个头以外，什么也看不清，驴子的头上张着两只大耳朵，马的头上竖立着尖尖的耳朵，那人的头下也有两只耳朵，这是扎在脖子上的头巾的结子……
    那人对马和驴子骂了两声，紧了紧脖子上的结子，随后把拖车的绳索套在肩上，身子向前面倾着，又开始拖那叽吱叫响的大车了……他空着的手，仍然和先前一样扬起鞭子，在牲口的脑袋旁甩出叭哒的声响……马的耳朵颤动着，驴子更低地埋下头来……稀稀落落的，冷嗖嗖的雪花正飘落着……
    街灯射着亮光……人用大车运着的白菜，马和驴子，可以闻到泥土和阳光的气味……还有马汗的气味。
    这些气味现在汇合成一种气味了，既不能叫出它的名字，也没有相似的东西可以和它比较。但这气味是可以认识出来的……
    我写在这里的一切，是我在夜间穿过北京的街头时刹那间见到的。我看见了，但是没有注意，看见这景象只是转瞬之间，跟着便忘记了……
    然而在第二天，当我在一间宽大的饭店里吃午饭的时候，我在一样味道很好的菜里，突然闻到这个熟悉的气味……
    我闻到了这气味，那幅景象立刻就在我的眼前出现了……
