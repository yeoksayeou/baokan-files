    The Chicken and Duck Free Market at Shanghai Dada Wharf
    Yang Ping
    Dada Wharf on the Huangpu River in Shanghai is a transportation hub connecting Shanghai with rural areas of northern Jiangsu, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Gaogang, and other places. Now, it is also a chicken and duck free market in Shanghai.
    One morning, I went to the wharf. Ships from northern Jiangsu were approaching the shore. Besides people, the ships were full of chicken and duck cages, and the chickens and ducks in the cages were chirping and squawking incessantly. Passenger Gu Jisheng is a small merchant from Shanghai. Since Shanghai opened the free market under the leadership of the state, he has been traveling between northern Jiangsu and Shanghai, selling ducks. This time, he purchased another batch of ducks from Gaogang in northern Jiangsu. His wife, standing on the dock, urged him to go home quickly, saying, "There are already many customers at home waiting for the goods." Passenger Chen Hongfa is a member of the Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Xin'an Township, Taixing County. He originally came to Shanghai to see his younger brother, but when he heard that chickens and ducks could be freely bought and sold, he brought more than a dozen chickens raised at home to Shanghai to sell. He plans to sell these chickens in Shanghai and then buy some winter daily necessities for his children. Some people came off the ship carrying baskets of dried shrimp or several baskets of crabs and eggs. They went to the vicinity of the dock and conducted transactions with purchasers from the Shanghai urban area. If the prices offered by both parties were suitable, the transaction was quickly completed.
    The Dada Wharf chicken and duck free market opened in July this year. At that time, Shanghai was hit by a typhoon, and the supply of non-staple foods in the market was tight. Citizens often could not buy chickens, and sometimes had to get up in the middle of the night to queue up to buy chickens. Even the sick and pregnant women could not buy hens to eat. For this reason, the Shanghai state-owned commercial departments decided to open the Dada Wharf chicken and duck free market, allowing vendors and farmers to directly engage in free trading. Shortly after the opening, Dada Wharf became lively, the source of chickens and ducks increased, and the daily market volume reached a maximum of 3,000 jin, accounting for 20% of Shanghai's daily total sales of live chickens. The phenomenon of queuing to buy chickens in the vegetable market has decreased. Some vendors often carried chicken cages to residents' doors to sell them in the afternoon. Because these chickens are directly transported from the place of origin, the intermediate turnaround time is short, the chicken meat is tender, and they are plump, they are very popular among residents.
    After the opening of the chicken and duck free market, the income of transporters and producers has increased. Staff of the food company told me that there are about 100 poultry vendors from various counties in northern Jiangsu every day. Most of them have close ties with rural areas and often go directly to farmers' homes to purchase chickens and ducks, pricing them according to quality. This has stimulated farmers' interest in raising and selling chickens. Members of some agricultural production cooperatives in northern Jiangsu, seeing the Dada Wharf chicken and duck market so active, have expressed that they will increase poultry production in the future to meet market needs. Small vendors have reduced mortality rates of chickens and ducks due to the reduction of intermediate circulation links in their operations, and their income has also increased relatively. A small vendor said: "I transport 600 jin of chickens to Shanghai at a time. The journey takes five days, and there is very little loss. After arriving in Shanghai, after deducting freight and taxes, selling them at the state-owned company's listed price, the net profit can reach about 20%."
    Strengthening the management of the Dada Wharf chicken and duck free market is still an important task for Shanghai's commercial departments. After the opening of the chicken and duck market, some chaotic situations occurred. For example, some bad elements snatched the chickens and ducks of small vendors at will, and some vendors filled the chicken's belly with large amounts of mud, sand, and debris in order to obtain windfall profits. The Shanghai Municipal Commercial Department has decided to set up an exchange at Dada Wharf to strengthen the leadership of the free market.
    The tax collection work in the chicken and duck market also urgently needs to be improved. Many vendors have reported that the tax authorities' tax collection procedures are too complicated. It takes too much time to queue up six times to pay the business tax once. Some vendors are dissatisfied with the deposit system implemented by the tax authorities. This system requires small vendors to pre-pay a certain amount of tax before selling their goods, and then refund or supplement the amount based on the turnover after the goods are sold. Generally, small vendors do not have enough funds, and it is difficult for them to prepay this amount. The tax department should study and solve these problems.

### 上海大达码头的鸡鸭自由市场

    上海大达码头的鸡鸭自由市场
    杨评
    上海黄浦江边的大达码头，是上海和苏北农村及南通、镇江、高港等地联系的交通站。现在，它又是上海的一个鸡鸭自由市场。
    一天上午，我到码头上去。苏北来的轮船正靠近岸，船上除了人，满载鸡鸭笼，关在笼里的鸡鸭吱吱地闹个不停。乘客顾吉生，是上海的一个小商贩。在上海开放国家领导下的自由市场以后，他就往返苏北和上海之间，贩卖鸭子。这次，他又从苏北高港采购了一批鸭子回来。站在码头上的他的妻子，催他快回家，说：“家里已经有许多顾客在催货了。”乘客陈鸿发，是泰兴县新安乡胜利农业社的社员。他原是到上海看弟弟的，听说鸡鸭可以自由卖买，便把家里养的十几只鸡也带到上海出卖了。他计划在上海卖掉这些鸡后，再买回一些冬季日用品给孩子。有的人提着一篮虾干，或几篮子大蟹、鸡蛋从船上下来了。他们走到码头附近，就和从上海市区来的采购人员进行交易，如果双方出的价格合适，买卖很快地就做成了。
    大达码头的鸡鸭自由市场，是今年7月开放的。当时，上海遭受台风袭击，市场副食品供应紧张，市民们经常买不到鸡，有时要半夜起来排队买鸡。甚至连病人和产妇也买不到母鸡吃。为此，上海国营商业部门决定开放大达码头的鸡鸭自由市场，允许小贩、农民直接进行自由买卖。开放后不久，大达码头便热闹起来了，鸡鸭货源增多，每天上市量最高达三千斤，占上海市每天毛鸡总销量的20％。菜场上排队买鸡的现象减少了。有些商贩，在下午的时候，还经常挑着鸡笼到居民门口兜售。因为这些鸡都是从产地直接运来的，中间周转时间少，鸡肉嫩，膘厚，很受居民欢迎。
    鸡鸭自由市场开放后，贩运者和生产者的收入都有了增加。食品公司的工作人员告诉我：每天由苏北各县来的家禽商贩，约有一百多人。他们大多和农村有密切联系，经常直接上农民家收购鸡鸭，按质论价。这就刺激了农民养鸡和售鸡的兴趣。苏北一些农业生产社的社员，见大达码头的鸡鸭市场这样活跃，都表示今后要增加家禽生产，满足市场的需要。小商贩在经营中，因中间流转环节减少，鸡鸭的死亡率减低，收入也相对地增加了。一个小贩说：“我一次贩运六百斤鸡来沪，沿途五天，损耗很少，到沪后除去运费、税款外，照国营公司牌价出售，纯利能达到20％左右。”
    加强对大达码头鸡鸭自由市场的管理，还是目前上海商业部门的一个重要任务。鸡鸭市场开放后，曾发生了一些混乱情况。例如，有些坏分子，把小商贩的鸡鸭随便抢走了，有些商贩，在鸡肚内填进大量的泥沙和杂物，以获取暴利。上海市商业部门已决定在大达码头设立交易所，加强对自由市场的领导。
    鸡鸭市场上的税收工作，也急待改进。许多商贩反映税务部门收税的手续太繁杂。缴一次行商税，要排六次队，花时间太多。一些商贩不满税务部门实行的缴纳押金制度。这制度，要小商贩在出售货物之前，预缴一定的税款，货物出售后，再根据营业额多退少补。一般商贩资金不足，要他们预付这笔款是有困难的，税收部门应研究解决这些问题。
