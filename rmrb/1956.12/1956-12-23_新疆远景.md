Xinjiang is a treasure land of the motherland. In the past, it had been sinking into a neglected and disregarded fate. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, this vast land has gradually become active, gradually attracted people's attention, and is considered to have great potential for development.

Xinjiang is a agricultural base with enormous potential in the motherland. Since ancient times, the people of Xinjiang have had a saying: "Where there is water, there is land." How much water does Xinjiang have annually? According to current estimates, the total amount of surface water in Xinjiang is about 60 billion cubic meters per year. In addition to surface water, Xinjiang also has a huge amount of groundwater, which will also need to be utilized in the future. How much land these waters can irrigate depends primarily on how much water a mu of land consumes, which involves the question of whether land irrigation and water management are scientific and rational. In 1954, Soviet water conservancy expert Voronin reported after inspecting the Manas River basin in Xinjiang that, including losses from seepage and evaporation, the amount of water consumed per mu of land was about 750 cubic meters. However, according to observations in recent years, only 30% of this 750 cubic meters of water per mu actually irrigates the land, with the remaining 70% lost due to leakage. With the increasing strengthening of national agricultural production management and the increasing improvement of agricultural technology, water management will gradually improve, irrigation will become more rational, and the average water consumption per mu is expected to gradually decrease. The same amount of water can irrigate more land in the future. For example, before liberation, the water volume of the Urumqi River was insufficient to irrigate 60,000 mu of land. After liberation, due to the construction of reservoirs upstream and the paving of channels with stones to reduce seepage, it can now irrigate 230,000 mu of land. The total area of Xinjiang is 1.7 million square kilometers, which is approximately equal to 2.5 billion mu, of which the arable land is generally estimated to be one hundred million mu or more. If, on the one hand, we increase water sources and strengthen water management, and on the other hand, we irrigate rationally and reduce water waste, the water in Xinjiang and the arable land in Xinjiang can generally be balanced.

By the end of 1955, the cultivated land area in Xinjiang was 25,520,000 mu, and it is planned to reclaim more than 60,000,000 mu within twelve years. However, to expand cultivated land, water conservancy must be built first. In order to store the unused water for use when needed, many reservoirs must be built; in order to divert water from where it is to where it is needed, a series of canals must be built; in order to further utilize groundwater resources, more karez wells, artesian wells, and deep well pumping methods will be used in the future. Xinjiang is now actively and systematically carrying out a full autonomous region-wide river survey, compiling basin plans, and building and renovating various water conservancy projects to create conditions for large-scale agricultural development. Now I will talk about some simple outlines here. First, let's talk about the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains. One of the main agricultural areas in the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains is the Manas River basin reclamation area. In this basin, the Daquangou Reservoir, Chepaizi Reservoir, and Liugou Reservoir have been built or are under construction. The planned reservoirs to be built include Jiahezi Reservoir, Moguhu Reservoir, Anjihai Reservoir, Kuitun River Reservoir, and Zhongjiazhuang Reservoir. These reservoirs will be completed before 1960. Another agricultural area on the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains is the Urumqi River basin. This area has built the Hongyanchi Reservoir, Mengjin Reservoir, and Bayi Reservoir, and also plans to build the Toutunhe Reservoir, Santunhe Reservoir, and Ulabo Reservoir. On the southern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains, one of the planned major projects is the change of course of the Kaidu River. Currently, the water from the Kaidu River flows into Bosten Lake east of Yanqi, and then from Bosten Lake into the Peacock River south of Tiemenguan. The surface of Bosten Lake is very wide, and the evaporation of water is very large. More than two-thirds of the water flowing into the lake from the Kaidu River is evaporated. At the same time, the water level of the lake is high, and the groundwater level in the lower reaches of the Kaidu River and the area along the lake is also raised accordingly, thereby increasing the degree of soil alkalization. The current plan is to open a new river west of Yanqi to lead the Kaidu River water directly through Tiemenguan into the Peacock River. After the Kaidu River water flows directly into the Peacock River, a new canal will be opened from the Peacock River, passing through the east of Yuli County and flowing to the Tieganli area between Yuli and Ruoqiang. Historically, that area was also a place with abundant water and lush grass, and a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry. Later, due to the change of course of the Tarim River, the water left and the land was abandoned and barren. After the planned new canal is opened, the land in that area will be revived, and it is estimated that 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 mu can be reclaimed. This new canal will be more than 200 kilometers long, the river surface is wide, the water flow is large, and it can also be navigable in the future. Another major plan on the southern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains is to connect the Aksu River basin and the Weigan River basin. The water volume of the Aksu River is relatively large, and its annual net flow is more than 6 billion cubic meters. Currently, the production troops have opened a Victory Canal on the west side of the Aksu River, which is more than 100 kilometers long, and diverted the Aksu River water to the Shakaizi and Halakule areas, opening three Victory Farms. There are also plans to divert the water from the Victory Canal to the Ulugqiao area south of the lower reaches of the Aksu River. On the north side of the Aksu River, from Aksu, Wensu, Baicheng, all the way to Shaya and Xinhe, there are more than 10,000,000 mu of wasteland that can be developed in this large area of land. The plan is to open a canal from Aksu to Kuqa, which is more than 300 kilometers long. This new canal is large in scale and can also be navigable. In the future, the new canal will continue to be opened to the east, extending all the way to Yuli.

The above is part of the huge plan to change the natural appearance of the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, which will be realized in the foreseeable short years. According to this great plan to transform nature, on the north road of the Tianshan Mountains, on a long stretch of wilderness from Qitai to Jinghe, which is more than 600 kilometers long, more than 10,000,000 mu of land, which has been barren to this day since its own history, will be reclaimed and turned into fertile land. In just the few years since liberation, we have seen great changes in the appearance of the roadsides when we passed by this road on the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains. New-style buildings have appeared in many places, and we can still see the dazzling electric lights when walking by at night. In another five or ten years, more large-scale state-owned farms and new farms will appear in this area. Reservoirs and canals will be connected to form an organic irrigation network. Roads and power lines will extend in all directions, becoming countless living blood vessels on this land.

On the south side of the Tianshan Mountains, the change in the natural appearance will be more significant and prominent than on the north side of the Tianshan Mountains. In the triangular area of the Aksu River, Weigan River, and Tarim River, which has always been a virgin land of reed lakes, grasslands, and jungles, it is now being heroically reclaimed by heroic people of the heroic era. In addition, those places from Yuli to Tieganli that have always been abandoned will soon have new cities due to the construction of new canals and the development of huge amounts of land. The reclamation work in both places will be carried out on a large scale, completely regularized, and largely mechanized. The Kaidu River change of course project has already started in 1956, and the plan to open a new canal from Aksu to Kuqa will be carried out in 1957. After these plans are realized, those two places that were originally barren and desolate will become prosperous and lively places. This is indeed a huge and proud historical change. In the future, it may be possible to navigate from the Aksu River basin to the Kaidu River basin through new canals, which is something that predecessors would never have imagined.

Geological surveys in Xinjiang are still just the beginning. We can only talk about an outline of the prospects for industrial construction in Xinjiang. First, let's talk about oil. People have known for a long time that Xinjiang produces oil. Recently, a huge oil field has been discovered in Karamay in the western Junggar Basin, which has attracted great attention from the whole country. The state is now vigorously accelerating the development of this oil area. However, in Xinjiang, oil resources are not limited to the northern foothills of the Tianshan Mountains. In southern Xinjiang, in the Kuqa and Baicheng areas and the Kashgar, Shache, and Bachu triangular area, there is oil underground. There is also oil in the Turpan Basin.

Xinjiang's coal resources are also very rich. On the north road of the Tianshan Mountains, from Qitai in the east to Usu and Jinghe in the west, the coal line is as long as five or six hundred kilometers, the thickness of the coal is as thick as more than one hundred meters, and the coal-bearing coefficient reaches 18%. The underground of Urumqi City is now a large coal field. In the past, the urban area of Urumqi was mainly concentrated on the east side of the Urumqi River. Due to the limitations of the terrain, it was not easy to develop. Now, coupled with the fact that the underground of the urban area is a large coal field to be mined, the city will have to plan to move to the northwest. There is also coal in the Hami area. Some of the coal currently used in the Qaidam Basin is supplied by Hami. There is also coal in Yili, which can be used as fuel for future industrial development in the local area. On the south side of the Tianshan Mountains, the two coal lines from Kuqa to Aksu and from Shache to Hotan are both more than 300 kilometers long, and the coal reserves are very large. There are fewer coal fields in the Altai Mountains. Currently, it is only known that there is coal in the Hebukesaier Mountains south of the Ertix River. There are also many scattered small coal mines scattered throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. Xinjiang's iron reserves are also abundant. The hematite in Nileke in the Yili area is famous and of good quality. There are also huge iron mines in Fuyun and Hejing. The pyrite in Shanshan is also of good quality. Jimusar and Urumqi both have siderite. By 1967, Nileke will become a comprehensive iron and steel industrial base in the westernmost part of the motherland.

In addition to oil, coal, and iron, Xinjiang also has many minerals, such as copper, aluminum, zinc, lead, tungsten, manganese, barite, salt, gypsum, sulfur, etc. There are copper mines in Kuqa, Baicheng, Wuqia, and Puli in southern Xinjiang. Nileke also produces copper. Lead-zinc mines are widely distributed, mainly from Wuqia to Shache. There are also zinc mines in the Yanqi area. In the past, the barite used in drilling mud was transported from the Soviet Union. Recently, barite mines have been discovered in Yining and have been produced. As for Xinjiang's salt, it is almost everywhere. Rare metals are also produced in the Altai Mountains.

In terms of light industry, Xinjiang will become one of the textile industrial bases of the motherland. By 1967, Xinjiang will produce 1.6 billion jin of ginned cotton annually, which can supply about 5 million spindles. Within twelve years, Xinjiang will set up 2,400,000 spindles, which can consume half of the cotton produced locally, and the remaining half will be supplied to the mainland. According to the current requirements of the state, a textile factory is most suitable for setting up 90,000 spindles, with six textile factories in each group. By 1967, Xinjiang will build four groups, one of which will be located in Shihezi, two in Korla, and one in Aksu. The textile factory in Shihezi will start construction in 1958. The factory in Korla will start construction in 1960.

In addition to the above four major industries, Xinjiang will of course have many other larger industries. In the future, looking from east to west, Hami, Urumqi, Shihezi, Usu, Nileke, and Yining in the middle of Xinjiang will all become emerging industrial cities. Among them, Shihezi will become a new light industrial city in northern Xinjiang with the textile industry as the focus. In addition to the textile industry, it may also have the sugar industry, oil extraction industry, and food processing industry. Dushanzi, Karamay, and Usu can be united as a unit to become an industrial zone for the petroleum industry and its subsidiary industries. Nileke will become a comprehensive iron and steel industrial base in the westernmost part of the motherland. In southern Xinjiang, Korla, Kuqa, Aksu, Kashgar, Shache, and Hotan will become a future line of industrial cities. Korla is also centered on the textile industry, and the hydropower generation at Tiemenguan is an advantage for its industrial construction. The development prospects of Shache are also great in the future because its fuel and hydropower conditions are very good. In northern Xinjiang, Fuyun has become an industrial city.

To cooperate with such a scale of industrial construction, there should be a corresponding power industry. The Ili River, Kaidu River, Manas River, Aksu River, and Weigan River can all generate hydroelectric power. Coupled with thermal power generation, Xinjiang's future electricity will be very sufficient.

Xinjiang has a vast territory, and the transportation problem has been a problem that has not been solved in history. This problem that has not been solved in history will be largely solved within twelve years. At present, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is advancing westward day by day, and it is expected that it can be laid to Urumqi in 1958. It can be connected to the Soviet Union in 1959. This railway basically solves the transportation problem from the mainland to Xinjiang. In the second five-year plan, a railway will be extended from Turpan, passing through Korla, Kuqa, and Aksu to Kashgar. This railway is expected to reach Kashgar before 1967. After this railway is opened to traffic, coupled with the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway that has already been opened to traffic, the main transportation problem within the Xinjiang Autonomous Region will be basically solved. Within the third five-year plan, a railway will be built eastward from Kashgar, passing through Shache, Hotan, Qiemo, and Ruoqiang to the Jinhong Pass on the border between Xinjiang and Qinghai. From there, it will be divided into two routes, one route connecting eastward to the railway of Mangai and the Qaidam Basin, and the other route connecting northeastward to Dunhuang and Anxi in Gansu. In addition, a railway will be built from Korla via Tieganli to Ruoqiang. In this way, the transportation problem in southern Xinjiang will be completely solved and form a circle, with the sound and breath connected. As for northern Xinjiang, a railway will be built from Usu over the Tianshan Mountains to Yining. In addition, a railway will be built to Altay. Due to the recent discovery of the Karamay oil area, the line to Altay will be extended from near Dushanzi in order to pass through the Karamay oil area and reach Altay. This route will also be built in advance. In this way, the transportation problem in northern Xinjiang is roughly solved.

At present, air transportation in Xinjiang is quite common. There are several flights from Urumqi to Lanzhou every week; through Lanzhou, it can be connected to other major cities in the country. Within the autonomous region, there are two flights a week from Urumqi to Yining, to Kuqa, Aksu, and Kashgar. Recently, the air route in southern Xinjiang has been extended to Hotan. The air route from Urumqi to Altay has also recently opened, so that all major cities in Xinjiang can reach Urumqi within one day.

In the old era, due to political corruption, production stagnation, cultural isolation, and transportation obstacles, economic, cultural, and travel exchanges between Xinjiang and the mainland were greatly restricted. People who occasionally returned to the mainland from Xinjiang in the old era often one-sidedly exaggerated the backward side of Xinjiang, so that for a long time, people were affected by those one-sided and untrue legends. When mentioning Xinjiang, they thought that there was nothing but cold, desolation, poverty, and backwardness. In fact, in Xinjiang, in winter, although it is colder north of the Tianshan Mountains, it is very warm south of the Tianshan Mountains. In areas such as Kashgar and Hotan, you don't need to wear leather clothes or cotton shoes in winter, which is warmer than winter in Beijing. Many people think that Xinjiang has the Gobi Desert, so they think that there is little production, the place is poor, and life is hard. In fact, Xinjiang's geological fertility, mineral wealth, land area, and great potential for the future are extremely attractive. Xinjiang's industrial resources are not only large in reserves, but also diverse. These all show that Xinjiang has multi-faceted comprehensive development value. After the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the country's support for Xinjiang in terms of manpower, materials, and technology can be transferred westward on a larger scale. The Party's efforts in Xinjiang in recent years are equivalent to writing a preface for the development of Xinjiang. A huge, brand-new, and epoch-making construction situation is about to unfold widely. In Xinjiang, the desolate scene of having to travel dozens or hundreds of miles to encounter a village will gradually become a thing of the past, and the degree of material and cultural prosperity will increase day by day. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the Han people, all ethnic brothers will give greater play to their strength in the socialist cause of building the frontier of the motherland and use their own labor to create a prosperous and happy life. Tens of millions of outstanding sons and daughters of New China, under the Party's patriotic call and national policy education, are also fortunate to have the glorious opportunity to gallop on that vast land and contribute their talents and wisdom to the construction of the motherland's frontier. This iron giant formed by all ethnic groups is marching heroically towards new victories!

    新疆远景
    储安平
    新疆是祖国的一块宝地。在过去的岁月中，它一直沉沦在冷落的被人漠视的命运里。解放以后，在党的领导下，这一大片土地逐渐活跃起来，逐渐受到人们的注意，并被认为有着极大的开发前途。
    新疆是祖国的一个具有巨大潜力的农业基地。自古以来新疆的人民都有这样一句话：有水斯有土。新疆每年究竟有多少水量？按照目前的估计，新疆全年地面上的水量约为六百多亿立方公尺。除了地上水以外，新疆还有着巨量的地下水，将来也须加以利用。这些水能够灌溉多少土地，首先决定于一亩田要消费多少水，这就牵涉到土地的灌溉和水的管理是否科学合理的问题。苏联水利专家沃洛宁1954年在新疆玛纳斯河流域视察时报告，包括渗漏和蒸发等损失在内，每亩地消费的水量约为七百五十立方公尺。但是这每亩消耗七百五十立方公尺水的计算，按照近几年来的观察，其中只有十分之三真正灌溉了土地，其余十分之七都是走漏损失掉了。随着国家对农业生产管理的日益加强和农业技术的日益提高，水的管理必将逐步提高，灌溉日益合理，每亩的平均用水量可望逐步降低，同样数量的水将来就可以灌溉更多的土地。例如乌鲁木齐河的水量，在解放前灌溉六万亩土地还嫌不足，解放以后，由于上游兴建了水库，又用石块铺砌渠道，减少了渗漏，现在已经可以灌溉二十三万亩土地。新疆的全部面积为一百七十万平方公里，约等于二十五亿亩，其中的可耕地，一般的估计是一亿几千万亩。假如一方面增开水源，加强水的管理，一方面合理灌溉，减少水的浪费，新疆的水和新疆的可耕地，大体上也还是可以求得平衡的。
    到1955年底，新疆全区的耕地面积是二千五百五十二万亩，计划在十二年内再开荒六千多万亩。但要扩大耕地，须先兴修水利。为了要把不用的水蓄起来，以便用之于需用之时，就要建筑很多水库；为了要把水从它所在的地方引送到需要它的地方，便要建筑一系列的渠道；为了要进一步利用地下水源，将来还要更多地运用坎儿井、自喷井和深井抽水等等方式。现在新疆正在积极地有步骤地进行全自治区的河流普查工作，编制流域规划，新建和改建各项水利工程，以创造大规模发展农业的条件。现在我在这儿谈一些简单的轮廓。先说天山北麓。天山北麓的主要农业地区之一是玛纳斯河流域垦区。这一流域里目前已修好及正在修的有大泉沟水库、车排子水库和柳沟水库，计划要修的还有夹河子水库、蘑姑湖水库、安集海水库、奎屯河水库和钟家庄水库等。这些水库在1960年前都要修完。天山北麓的另一个农业区是乌鲁木齐河流域。这一地区已修了红雁池水库、猛进水库和八一水库，还要修头屯河水库、三屯河水库以及乌拉伯水库。在天山南麓，计划中的大工程之一是开都河的改道。目前开都河的水流入焉耆东面的博斯腾湖，再由博斯腾湖流入铁门关以南的孔雀河。博斯腾湖的湖面很广，水的蒸发量很大，从开都河流入湖里的水，三分之二以上都被蒸发掉了。同时，湖的水位高，开都河下游和沿湖地带的地下水位也即随之提高，从而增加了土地碱化的程度。目前计划在焉耆西面开一条新河，把开都河水穿过铁门关直接引入孔雀河。开都河水直接流入孔雀河以后，将从孔雀河再开一条新渠道，经过尉犁县的东面流到从尉犁到婼羌之间的铁干里一带。在历史上，那一带曾经也是一个水足草秀，农牧并茂的地方，后来由于塔里木河的改道，水走了，土地遂被遗弃荒芜。计划中的新渠道开辟后，那一带的土地将重新复苏过来，估计将可开垦三百万到四百万亩。这条新渠道将长达二百公里以上，河面宽，流水量大，将来并且可以通航。天山南麓的另一个大计划是要使阿克苏河流域和渭干河流域连接起来。阿克苏河的水量较大，它的年净流量有六十多亿立方公尺。目前生产部队在阿克苏河的西面开了一条长达一百多公里的胜利渠，把阿克苏河水引到沙开子和哈拉库勒一带，开了三个胜利农场。还打算把胜利渠的水引到阿克苏河下游南面的乌鲁桥一带去。在阿克苏河的北面，即从阿克苏、温宿、拜城、一直通到沙雅和新和，这一大片土地上有一千万亩以上的荒地可以开发。计划中要从阿克苏开一条长达三百公里以上的渠道通到库车。这条新渠道规模很大，也可在渠道中通航。将来还要把新的渠道继续东开，一直延伸到尉犁。
    以上就是在可以望见的短短几年以内将要实现的天山南北改变自然面貌的巨大计划的一部分。按照这个伟大的改造自然的计划，在天山的北路，从奇台到精河这长达六百多公里的一长片原野上，将有自有历史以来荒芜至今的一千几百万亩土地，被开垦变为良田。仅仅是解放以后这几年，我们在天山北麓这一条公路上走过时，已看到公路两旁的面貌有着很大的改变。很多地方出现了一幢幢新式的建筑，夜晚走过还看到闪闪耀目的电灯。要是再过五年十年，这一带必将出现更多的规模巨大的国营农场和新的农庄。水库和渠道将接连成为一个有机的灌溉网。公路和电线四通八达，将成为这一片土地上无数活血的脉络。
    在天山以南，自然面貌的改变将比天山以北更要显著突出。在阿克苏河、渭干河和塔里木河这一块三角地带，一向是一片苇湖、草滩和丛林的处女地，现在将被英雄时代的英雄人们英勇地开垦出来。另外，从尉犁到铁干里那些素来被人遗弃的地方，由于新的渠道的修建和巨量土地的开发，不久将会出现新的城市。两地的垦荒工作，都将在规模巨大的、完全正规化的、并在很大程度上机械化的情况下进行。开都河的改道工程1956年即已着手进行，从阿克苏开一条新渠到库车的计划，1957年就要进行。这些计划实现以后，那两个原来是荒芜冷落的地方，将变为富庶热闹的地方。这确实是巨大的可以自豪的历史改变。将来还有可能从阿克苏河流域通过新建渠道，一直通航到开都河流域，这也是前人做梦也不会想像到的事情。
    新疆的地质调查工作还是一个开端。对于新疆工业建设的远景，也只能谈一个轮廓。先说石油。人们很早就知道新疆出产石油。最近在准噶尔盆地西部的克拉玛依地方发现了规模巨大的油田，引起了全国极大的注意。现在国家正在大力加速开发这个油区。但在新疆，石油资源并不仅限于天山北麓，在南疆，在库车、拜城一带和喀什、莎车、巴楚这一个三角地带，地下都有石油。吐鲁番盆地也有石油。
    新疆煤的资源也很丰富。在天山北路，东起奇台，西迄乌苏、精河一带，煤线长达五六百公里，煤的厚度厚到一百公尺以上，含煤系数达到18％。现在乌鲁木齐市的地下，就是一个大煤田。乌鲁木齐市区过去主要集中在乌鲁木齐河的东面，由于地形的限制，不易发展。现在再加上市区地下是一个将待开采的大煤田，这个城市将要有计划地向西北移动发展。哈密地区也有煤，目前柴达木盆地用的一部分煤就是由哈密供应的。伊犁也有煤，可供将来当地发展工业的燃料之用。在天山以南，从库车到阿克苏和从莎车到和阗这两条煤线都长达三百公里以上，煤的储藏量很大。阿尔泰山一带的煤田较少，目前仅知额尔齐斯河南面的和布克赛尔山中有煤。其他散在天山南北各地的零星煤矿也还很多。新疆铁的储量也是丰富的。伊犁地区尼勒克的赤铁矿是有名的，成份也好。在富蕴和和靖也有巨大的铁矿。鄯善的硫铁矿质量也很好。吉木萨尔和乌鲁木齐则都有菱铁矿。到1967年，尼勒克将成为祖国最西部的一个综合性的钢铁工业基地。
    除了石油、煤、铁以外，新疆还有很多矿产，如铜、铝、锌、铅、钨、锰、重晶石、盐、石膏、硫磺等等。南疆的库车、拜城、乌恰、蒲犁一带都有铜矿。尼勒克也产铜。铅锌矿的分布很广，主要在乌恰到莎车一带。焉耆一带也有锌矿。过去钻井泥浆所用的重晶石都是从苏联运来的，最近在伊宁发现了重晶石矿，并已生产。至于新疆的盐，几乎到处皆是。在阿尔泰山地区，还出产稀有金属。
    在轻工业方面，新疆将成为祖国的纺织工业基地之一。到1967年，新疆将年产皮棉十六亿斤，大约可供五百多万纱锭之用。在十二年内新疆将要设置二百几十万个纱锭，可以消费本地所产棉花的半数，其余半数供应内地。按照现在国家的要求，一个纺织厂最适宜是设置九万个纱锭，每六个纺织厂为一组。到1967年，新疆将建成四个组，其中一个组设在石河子，两个组设在库尔勒，一个组设在阿克苏。石河子的纺织厂1958年就要兴工。库尔勒的将在1960年兴工。
    除了上述四大工业以外，新疆当然还将有很多其他较大的工业。将来我们从东往西看，在新疆的中路，哈密、乌鲁木齐、石河子、乌苏、尼勒克、伊宁都将成为新兴的工业城市。其中石河子将成为北疆的一个以纺织工业为重点的新的轻工业城市。除了纺织工业以外，它还可能有制糖工业、榨油工业和食品加工工业。独山子、克拉玛依和乌苏可以联成一个单位，成为石油工业及其附属工业的一个工业地带。尼勒克将成为祖国最西部的一个综合性的钢铁工业基地。在新疆的南路，库尔勒、库车、阿克苏、喀什、莎车、和阗将成为一条未来的工业城市线。库尔勒也是以纺织工业为中心，铁门关的水力发电对于那儿的工业建设是一个有利条件。将来莎车的发展前途也很大，因为它的燃料和水力的条件都很好。在新疆的北部，富蕴已经成为一个工业城市。
    配合这样规模的工业建设，就应该有相应的电力工业。伊犁河、开都河、玛纳斯河、阿克苏河、渭干河等河，都可以水力发电。再加上火力发电，新疆将来的电力，是十分充足的。
    新疆地方辽阔，交通问题是自有历史以来一直未能得到解决的问题。这个历史上一直未能解决的问题在十二年以内也将大都可以得到解决。目前兰新铁路日益西进，预计1958年可以铺到乌鲁木齐。1959年可以和苏联通车。这一条铁路基本上解决了从内地到新疆的交通问题。第二个五年计划内，将从吐鲁番延伸一条铁路，经库尔勒、库车、阿克苏而达喀什。这条铁路预期于1967年以前通达喀什。这条铁路通车以后，加上早已通车了的兰新铁路，基本上解决了新疆自治区内部的主要交通问题。第三个五年计划以内，还要从喀什向东修一条铁路，经过莎车、和阗、且末、若羌通到新疆和青海交界的金鸿山口。由此再分两路，一路向东经茫崖和柴达木盆地的铁路衔接，另一路向东北经敦煌和甘肃安西衔接。另外，再从库尔勒修一条铁路经铁干里到达若羌，这样，南疆的交通问题就全部解决，而且环成一圈，声气呵通。至于北疆，将从乌苏修一条铁路翻过天山通达伊宁。另外要修一条铁路到阿勒泰。由于最近克拉玛依油区的发现，通达阿勒泰的一线将由独山子附近延伸出去，以便通过克拉玛依油区而达阿勒泰。这条路线并将提前修筑。这样，北疆的交通问题大体上也算得到了解决。
    目前新疆的航空交通已经相当普遍。从乌鲁木齐到兰州每星期有好几次飞机；通过兰州可以和国内其他大城市通航。在自治区内部，乌鲁木齐到伊宁，到库车、阿克苏和喀什，每星期都有两次飞机。最近南疆的航线又扩展到了和阗。从乌鲁木齐到阿勒泰的航线最近也已开航，这样，新疆各主要城市都能在一天以内到达乌鲁木齐。
    在旧时代，由于政治腐朽、生产停滞、文化闭塞、交通阻隔，新疆和内地在经济、文化和旅行的交往上都受到很大的限制。旧时代偶尔从新疆回返内地的人们，常常片面地夸大新疆落后的一面，以致长时期来，人们受着那些片面的不真实的传说的影响，一提到新疆，便以为那儿除了寒冷、荒凉、贫穷、落后以外，一无可取。其实，在新疆，在冬天，天山以北虽然较冷，天山以南却很和暖。像喀什、和阗一带，过冬可以不穿皮衣，不穿棉鞋，比北京的冬天还暖和。很多人以为新疆有戈壁沙漠，便以为那儿出产少，地方穷，生活苦。实际上，新疆地质之肥，矿产之富，土地之广，前途之大有可为，都是极其吸引人心的。新疆的工业资源，不仅储量大，而且方面多。这些都说明新疆有着多方面的综合开发价值。兰新铁路通车以后，全国对新疆的人力、物力、技术的支援就可以在较大的规模下源源西移。这几年来党在新疆的努力，等于为开发新疆写下了一页序言。一个巨大的、崭新的、划时代的建设局面接着就要广泛展开。在新疆，要走几十、几百里才能遇到一个村子的那种荒凉的景象，将逐步成为过去，而物质的和文化的繁荣富庶的程度则将与日俱增。各兄弟民族在党的领导和汉族的帮助下，将更大地发挥他们在建设祖国边疆的社会主义事业中的力量，用自己的劳动来创造富裕幸福的生活。数以千万计的新中国的优秀儿女，在党的爱国主义号召下和民族政策教育下，也都庆幸自己能够获得光荣的机会在那广阔无边的大地上纵横驰骋，为祖国的边疆建设贡献自己的才能智慧。这个各民族结成的铁的巨人正在豪迈地奔向一个一个的新的胜利！
