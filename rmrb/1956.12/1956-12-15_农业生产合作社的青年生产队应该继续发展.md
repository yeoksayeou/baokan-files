Youth Production Teams in Agricultural Production Cooperatives Should Continue to Develop
	Youth production teams in agricultural cooperatives in various regions have achieved great success in increasing production over the past year. Some comrades believe that establishing youth production teams has more disadvantages than advantages. Will establishing youth production teams weaken the labor force and backbone strength of other production teams? Will youth production teams ruin production and reduce income? Will establishing youth production teams make it impossible to rationally use semi-labor and auxiliary labor, and will it break up farmer families? Is it only possible to give full play to the leading role of young people by dispersing them in various teams? These questions are actually not problems at all. Youth production teams should be retained and continue to develop. When establishing youth production teams, it is necessary to adapt to the specific conditions of various regions and cooperatives.
	Liu Zhao
	Last winter and this spring, with the upsurge of the collectivization movement, a large number of youth production teams emerged in agricultural production cooperatives across the country. They are production organizations under the unified leadership of the cooperative's management committee, with young people as the main members, and absorbing a certain number of adult and elderly farmers for technical guidance. According to incomplete statistics, there are approximately 150,000 teams, with more than 4 million members.
	Under the leadership of the agricultural cooperative's management committee, many youth production teams have experimented with and promoted various production-increasing technical measures and fought against natural disasters, achieving great success. Many youth production teams are called "key teams," "leading teams," "vanguard teams," "demonstration teams," and "experimental teams." Their achievements have won the praise of parents and older people.
	However, there are still some problems in the work of establishing and leading youth production teams in various regions. For example, some youth production teams lack sufficient technical backbone; some youth production team members have high enthusiasm for production, but do not pay enough attention to their health; some cooperatives that do not meet the conditions for establishing youth production teams have also established them; the organizational form and members of a small number of youth production teams are not appropriate; and there are other problems arising from this. These need to be resolved in future work. In general, the youth production team is still a good form of organization.
	The main problem at present does not lie in these problems themselves, but in the views of some of our comrades on the organizational form of the youth production team. Some comrades believe that establishing youth production teams has more disadvantages than advantages; or simply believe that establishing youth production teams will disrupt the natural division of labor in agricultural cooperatives, and is therefore wrong. As a result, some youth production teams that should not have been disbanded have been disbanded.
	Is there really a need for youth production teams? This question is indeed worth studying.
	Some comrades say that establishing youth production teams will weaken the main labor force of other production teams. The actual situation is not like this. The vast majority of youth production teams are only composed of a small part of the young people in the cooperative, rather than drawing out all the young people in the cooperative. In addition to most of the members being young people, there are also a small number of adults and elderly people in the youth production teams.
	According to a survey of 5,504 youth production teams in 36 counties in Jiangsu Province, there are a total of 152,674 members (an average of less than 28 per team), of which young people account for 70.2% of the total (an average of less than 20 young people per team), and adults account for 29.7% of the total (an average of about eight or nine people per team). This does not have any bad impact on agricultural cooperatives with an average of more than 100 households.
	Does it weaken the backbone of other production teams? No, it doesn't. In these 5,504 teams, there is an average of only one party member per youth production team, and in some places there is an average of less than one party member per team. There are slightly more CYL members in the youth production teams, but there are only four or five per team on average.
	According to a survey conducted in May this year by the Xintuan Agricultural Cooperative in Xintuan Township, Dongtai County, the cooperative has a total of 13 production teams, 48 party members, an average of more than three party members per team, and 79 CYL members, an average of more than five CYL members per team. This cooperative has a youth production team, which is led by the first brigade. Also under the leadership of the first brigade are the "Xinxin Team" and the "Xintuan Team." The labor situation of these three production teams is: young labor accounts for 65.4% of the "Youth Production Team"; young labor accounts for 25% of the "Xinxin Team"; young labor accounts for 30.18% of the "Xintuan Team". In the second brigade of this cooperative, where no youth production team has been established, the labor situation of the two teams is as follows: young labor accounts for 25.3% in one team, and 25% in the other. It can be seen that the establishment of youth production teams does not have much impact on the distribution of labor in each team.
	So, what about the situation of the backbone? The situation of the three teams in the first brigade of this cooperative is: the youth production team has one party member and eleven CYL members, the "Xinxin Team" has four party members and six CYL members, and the "Xintuan Team" has six party members and seven CYL members. It can be seen that after the establishment of the youth production team, it will not necessarily weaken the backbone strength of other teams.
	Some people also say: "Youth production teams will ruin production." This statement is also incorrect. There are 50 youth production teams in Zhenze County, Jiangsu Province. This year, the county's average summer wheat yield was 245.5 jin per mu; the output of 38 youth production teams that harvested and threshed independently averaged 271.7 jin per mu, 10.71% higher than the county's average output. The youth production team of the Xinghuo Cooperative in this county created the highest wheat yield record in the county's history, reaching 743 jin per mu. Many cooperatives that have not established youth production teams are asking to establish them. Therefore, the Zhenze County Committee of the CPC made a decision in August this year to continue to establish youth production teams.
	In mountainous and hilly areas with lower yields, the role of youth production teams is even more prominent. According to summer harvest statistics of 120 youth teams in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, the average wheat yield per mu of 94 teams exceeded the average yield of the entire cooperative, and the average yield per mu of 142 youth production teams in the county exceeded the county average by 44%. Sixty-six youth production teams were rated as red flag teams of the cooperative, and 72 teams became the base point teams of the cooperative.
	Some people doubt that the income of youth production teams may not necessarily increase. Then, let's take a look at the summer pre-distribution situation of the Xinghuo Cooperative. The youth production team of this cooperative is adjacent to the seventh team, and the soil quality and other conditions are roughly the same. Among the households whose income increased by more than 150 yuan compared to last year, there were four in the youth production team and none in the seventh team; among those whose income increased by more than 100 yuan, there were six in the youth production team and two in the seventh team; the income of other households in the youth team was also no less than that of the seventh team. It can be seen that as long as the leadership is good, the question of whether the youth production team can increase income does not exist.
	Some people also believe that if young people account for 60%-70% of the youth production team, the semi-labor and auxiliary labor in the team will inevitably be insufficient, which will cause production difficulties and labor waste; and some people blame the youth production team for "breaking up farmer families." These are all one-sided statements.
	First, let's look at the issue of semi-labor and auxiliary labor. For example, among the thousands of youth production teams in Jiangsu, nearly 3,000 are based on households, with young people accounting for 60%-70%, and the allocation of auxiliary labor and semi-labor is also appropriate. Here, we must also see that even if youth production teams are not entirely based on households, as long as the agricultural cooperative makes appropriate arrangements, semi-labor and auxiliary labor will not be a big problem, because although young people account for 60%-70% of the youth production teams, this includes some young people under the age of eighteen and young women, most of whom are semi-labor and auxiliary labor; in addition, the youth production teams also include some adults and elderly people, some of whom are also semi-labor and auxiliary labor. Taking the three youth production teams in Angu Township, Leshan County, Sichuan Province as an example, the total labor situation of the three cooperatives is: 407 full laborers, 543 semi-laborers, and 333 auxiliary laborers; the sum of semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers is more than twice that of full laborers. The labor force of these three youth production teams is: 17 full laborers, 31 semi-laborers, and 5 auxiliary laborers; the sum of semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers is also more than twice that of full laborers.
	What is the relationship between youth production teams and families? With the further development of agriculture and the increasing refinement of the division of labor in cooperatives, it is not necessary for a family to work together. Even before agricultural collectivization, not all members of a family went to work, let alone all of them going to work in the same place at the same time. Therefore, whether or not families are broken up has little to do with the establishment of youth production teams.
	Some comrades disagree with the establishment of youth production teams because they believe that young people have a strong spirit of initiative and progress, and if these young people are dispersed in various production teams, they can play a leading role, while avoiding the "trouble" caused by the establishment of youth production teams.
	I think that the comrades who put forward this opinion have not clarified the following two questions: First, there are many ways and forms to give play to the active leading role of rural youth. Dispersing young people to various production teams is one way, and this way does not exclude the establishment of youth production teams. As for some comrades who regard youth production teams as the only way to give play to the enthusiasm of young people, while ignoring the enthusiasm of other young people, this is only a problem in work and ideological understanding, which should be corrected, but there is no reason to deny the organizational form of youth production teams because of this. Second, facts have proved that the youth production team has its unique role, which cannot be completely replaced by other methods. In order to achieve the goal of increasing production and income, one of the methods of the cooperative is to concentrate a part of the most active and least conservative young people, organize youth production teams, and give play to their leading and demonstration role. Taking the promotion of advanced agricultural production technology and experience as an example, if young people scattered in various production teams encounter resistance from conservative ideas, they do not have land for which they are responsible, and it is difficult to do so. With the youth production team, it is possible to make a model on a part of the land first. In the work of promoting advanced technology and experience in many places this year, it can be seen that youth production teams have played a unique role. There is also a situation worth noting here. In the past, we have cultivated and discovered many model figures of high yield, which have played a demonstration role. However, there are more model individuals of high yield and fewer advanced collectives, the area of high yield is often very small, and the impact is often not very large, and some people even doubt whether this is an accidental success. If there is such a production team that implements a series of production-increasing measures from beginning to end on a large area, and thus obtains a higher yield, the masses will be convinced.
	In short, I think we should take a positive attitude towards the organizational form of youth production teams. However, this does not mean that youth production teams are all good and there are no problems. There are still many problems. These problems can be summarized into two aspects: one is the problem of organization, and the other is the problem of leadership. Some agricultural cooperatives that do not meet the conditions for establishing youth production teams have reluctantly established them; some teams have concentrated too many young backbones, or there are too few young people and they are not worthy of the name, etc., all of which are organizational problems. The problems in leadership are mainly manifested in the fact that some party organizations and leaders of the cooperatives believe that youth production teams are the business of the CYL, and therefore do not provide enough leadership and help; some only pay attention to cultivating "typical examples," and rarely consider the demonstration role of youth production teams, etc. Such "typical examples" cannot be learned by other teams. These problems have been paid attention to and corrected in various places.
	According to the experience of the past year, youth production teams should continue to be established as long as they can be established under appropriate circumstances and conditions; however, attention must be paid to the following issues when establishing youth production teams: (1) Youth production teams should generally not be too large, and about 30 laborers are enough. In cooperatives with about 100 households, youth production teams can be established separately, or youth production sub-teams can be established in production teams. (2) Youth production teams can only concentrate a small part of the youth in the entire cooperative, with the principle of not hindering the natural allocation of labor in other production teams. (3) Young laborers in youth production teams should account for about 55%-65% of the total labor in the team. Too few young people are not worthy of the name, and too many are both difficult and unnecessary. (4) Youth production teams must have strong administrative leadership and technical guidance. (5) It is best to form production teams based on households with many young people, and the residence of team members should not be too scattered. Agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas and scattered villages should not be established.

    农业生产合作社的青年生产队应该继续发展
    一年来各地农业社的青年生产队在增加生产方面是有很大成绩的——有些同志认为建立青年生产队好处少、坏处多——建立青年生产队就会削弱别的生产队的劳动力和骨干力量吗？——青年生产队会搞坏生产、减少收入吗？——建立青年生产队就会使半劳力、辅助劳力不能合理使用，就会拆散农民家庭吗？——把青年分散在各个队才可能发挥他们的带头作用吗？——这些问题实际上都不成为问题——青年生产队应该保留和继续发展——在建立青年生产队的时候应该适应各地各社的具体条件
    留照
    去年冬天和今年春天，随着合作化运动的高涨，在各地农业生产合作社内出现了大批青年生产队，它们是在合作社管理委员会统一领导下以青年为主要成员，吸收一定数量的成年老年农民为技术指导的生产组织。据不完全统计，队数大约有十五万个左右，队员在四百万人以上。
    许多青年生产队在农业社管理委员会的领导下，试行和推广各种增产技术措施，和自然灾害作斗争，取得了很大的成绩。许多青年生产队被称为“重点队”“带头队”“先锋队”“示范队”“试验队”。它们的成绩，博得了家长和老年人的赞许。
    但是，各地在建立和领导青年生产队的工作中也还有一些问题。例如：有的青年生产队内缺乏足够的技术骨干；有的青年生产队的队员生产积极性很高，但对身体健康注意不够；有些社不够条件建立青年生产队也建立了；少数青年生产队的组织形式和成员不够妥当；还有由此引起的其他问题。这些都需要在今后工作中加以解决。总的来说，青年生产队这种组织还是好的。
    目前的主要问题并不在以上这些问题本身，而在于我们有些同志对青年生产队这个组织形式的看法上。有些同志认为建立青年生产队是好处少，坏处多；或者干脆认为建立青年生产队就会打乱农业社的自然分工，因而是错误的。因此，有些不应该解散的青年生产队被解散了。
    青年生产队到底需要不需要呢？这个问题确是值得加以研究的。
    有的同志说，建立青年生产队，就会削弱别的生产队的主要劳动力。实际情况并不如此，绝大多数青年生产队只是由合作社内一小部分青年组成的，而不是把合作社里的青年全部抽出来。在青年生产队里，除了大部分是青年以外，也还有少数的成年老年。
    根据江苏省三十六个县五千五百零四个青年生产队的调查统计，共有队员十五万二千六百七十四人（平均每队不到二十八人），其中青年占总数的70.2％（平均每个队的青年不足二十人），成年人占总数的29.7％（平均每队约八、九个人）。这对于平均每社一百多户的农业合作社说来是没有什么不好的影响的。
    是不是削弱了别的生产队的骨干呢？并没有。在这五千五百零四个队里，平均每个青年生产队只有一个党员，有些地方每个队还平均不到一个党员。在青年生产队里团员略为多些，但平均每队也只有四、五个。
    据东台县新团乡新团农业合作社今年5月的调查，全社共有十三个生产队，党员四十八人，平均每队三个多人，团员七十九人，平均每队五个多人。这社有一个青年生产队，属第一大队领导，同属第一大队领导的还有“新新队”和“新团队”，这三个生产队的劳动力情况是：“青年生产队”的青年劳力占65.4％；“新新队”青年劳力占25％；“新团队”青年劳力占30.18％。这个社里没有建立青年生产队的第二大队的两个队，劳力情况是这样：一个队青年劳力占25.3％，另一个占25％。由此可见，建立了青年生产队对于各个队的劳力的分配并没有多大影响。
    那么，骨干的情况又是怎样呢？这个社的第一大队里的三个队的情况是：青年生产队有党员一人，团员十一人，“新新队”有党员四人，团员六人，“新团队”有党员六人，团员七人。由此可见，青年生产队建立以后，并不一定会削弱其他队的骨干力量。
    也有人说：“青年生产队会搞坏生产”。这种说法也不对。江苏省震泽县有五十个青年生产队。今年这个县夏季平均每亩地收小麦二百四十五点五斤；三十八个单收单打的青年生产队的产量，平均每亩收二百七十一点七斤，比全县的平均产量高出10.71％。这个县星火社的青年生产队，创造了全县历史上小麦产量的最高纪录，每亩达到七百四十三斤。许多没有建立青年生产队的合作社都要求建立。因此，中共震泽县委今年8月份作出了继续建立青年生产队的决定。
    产量较低的山区和丘陵地区，青年生产队的作用还要突出。根据江苏省江宁县一百二十个青年队的夏收统计：有九十四个队小麦平均亩产量超过全社的平均产量，全县一百四十二个青年生产队的平均亩产量超过全县平均产量的44％。六十六个青年生产队被评为合作社的红旗队，七十二个队成为合作社的基点队。
    有人怀疑青年生产队收入不一定能增加。那么，就看一下星火社的夏季预分情况吧。这个社的青年生产队和第七队相邻，土质等条件大体相同。收入比去年增加一百五十元以上的，青年生产队有四户，第七队没有；增加百元以上的，青年生产队有六户，第七队二户；其他户的收入，青年队也不比第七队少。由此可见，只要领导得好，青年生产队是否能增加收入的问题，也是不存在的。
    还有人认为，如果青年生产队里的青年占了60％—70％，队里的半劳力和辅助劳力就必然不足，因而会造成生产上的困难和劳力的浪费；又有人以“青年生产队拆散农民家庭”为理由来责备青年生产队。这些都是片面的说法。
    首先来看看半劳力和辅助劳力的问题。例如江苏的几千个青年生产队中，有近三千个是以户为基础建立起来的，青年占60％—70％，而辅助劳力和半劳力的配置也是恰当的。这里，我们还要看到，即使不完全以户为基础来建立青年生产队，只要农业社适当加以安排，半劳力和辅助劳力也不会发生多大问题，因为青年生产队中的青年虽然占60％—70％，这当中还包括一些十八岁以下的青年和青年妇女，这些人大多数是半劳力和辅助劳力；此外，青年生产队还包括一部分成年老年，其中也有半劳力和辅助劳力。以四川省乐山县安谷乡的三个青年生产队为例，三个社的总劳力情况是：全劳力四百零七个，半劳力为五百四十三个，辅助劳力三百三十三个；半劳力和辅助劳力的总和相当全劳力的两倍强。而这三个青年生产队的劳力是：全劳力十七个，半劳力三十一个，辅助劳力五个，半劳力和辅助劳力的总和也相当全劳力的两倍强。
    青年生产队和家庭的关系如何呢？随着农业的进一步发展，合作社的劳动分工的日益细致，一家人不一定都非一起劳动不可。即使在农业合作化以前，也不是一家人全部去劳动的，更不是全部同时到一个地方去劳动。因此，拆散不拆散家庭，同建立青年生产队并没有多大关系。
    还有些同志不同意建立青年生产队，他们的理由是：青年富有积极进取的精神，如果把这些青年分散在各个生产队里，可以发挥他们的带头作用，同时又可以避免由于建立青年生产队所引起的“麻烦”。
    我觉得，提出这种意见的同志没有把以下两个问题搞清楚：第一，发挥农村青年积极带头作用的办法和形式是多种多样的。把青年分散到各个生产队是一种办法，而这办法并不排斥建立青年生产队的这种办法。至于有些同志把青年生产队作为发挥青年积极性的唯一办法，而忽视了发挥其他青年的积极性。这只是工作上和思想认识上的问题，是应该纠正的，但没有理由因此就来否定组织青年生产队这种形式。第二，事实证明，青年生产队这种形式有它独特的作用，而不是其他办法可以完全代替的。合作社为达到增产增收的目的，办法之一就是把一部分最积极、最少保守思想的青年集中起来，组织青年生产队，发挥他们的带头示范作用。以推广先进农业生产技术经验来说，分散在各个生产队中的青年，如果遇到保守思想的抵触，他们没有自己负责的土地，就很难办到。有了青年生产队，就可以先在一部分土地上做出样子来。在今年许多地方推广先进技术经验的工作中，都可以看到青年生产队起了独特作用。这里还有一个情况值得注意。过去，我们培养和发现了不少丰产模范人物，起了示范的作用。但是，丰产的模范个人较多，先进集体较少，丰产的面积常常很小，影响往往不很大，甚至还有些群众怀疑这是不是偶然获得的成功。如果有这样一个生产队，在较大的面积上从头到尾地贯彻一系列的增产措施，因而获得了较高的产量，群众就会心悦诚服了。
    总之，我认为对青年生产队这种组织形式应该采取肯定的态度。但是，这决不是说，青年生产队都很好，没有什么问题了。问题还是很多的。这些问题归纳起来可分两个方面：一是组织的问题，二是领导的问题。有些没有条件建立青年生产队的农业社也勉强建立了；有些队青年骨干集中过多，或者青年过少、名不副实等等，都是组织方面的问题。领导方面的问题主要表现在，有些党组织和社的领导干部认为青年生产队是青年团的事，因之对它领导和帮助不够；有些只注意了培养“典型”，很少考虑到青年生产队的示范作用等。这样的“典型”是别的队没法学习的。这些问题，各地已经注意进行纠正。
    根据一年来的经验，在适当的情况和条件下，青年生产队只要能够建立，就应该继续建立；只不过，建立青年生产队必须注意这样几个问题：（一）青年生产队一般不宜过大，能有三十个左右的劳动力就可以了。在百户左右的合作社里，可以单独建立青年生产队，或者在生产队里设立青年生产小队。（二）青年生产队只能集中全社一小部分青年，以不妨碍其他生产队中劳动力的自然搭配为原则。（三）青年生产队里的青年劳力应占全队劳力的55％—65％左右。青年过少则名不副实，过多既有困难，也不必要。（四）青年生产队必须有较强的行政领导和技术指导力量。（五）以青年多的户为基础，适当抽调青年组成生产队为最好，队员的居住也不可过于分散。山区和村庄分散的农业社，不宜建立。
