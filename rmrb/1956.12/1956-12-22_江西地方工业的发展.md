    Jiangxi Local Industry Development

    (Our newspaper, Nanchang, 19th) By the end of November, Jiangxi Province had overfulfilled the local basic construction tasks stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan by 4%.

    In the past four years, the province has newly built a total of twenty-eight local state-owned factories and mines, and renovated ninety-four factories and mines. These newly built and renovated factories and mines include industries such as machinery, electricity, coal, textile, printing and dyeing, and papermaking. After the expansion of the Jiangxi Machinery Factory, this year's output increased fivefold compared to last year. After the new Zhongjiashan, Dongjiashan, and the renovated Tianhe, Fengcheng and other coal mines, the uneven distribution of past raw coal production, mostly concentrated in the Pingxiang area, has been changed. After the expansion of the famous Jingdezhen Porcelain Factory, this year's output has doubled compared to 1952, and the quality has also been significantly improved.

    江西地方工业的发展

    四年来，全省一共新建了二十八个地方国营厂矿，改建了九十四个厂矿。这些新建、改建的厂矿企业，有机械、电力、煤炭、纺织、印染、造纸等行业。扩建后的江西机械厂，今年产量比去年增加五倍；新建钟家山、董家山和改建天河、丰城等煤矿以后，改变了过去原煤生产大部分集中在萍乡一带的分布不匀情况。驰名的景德镇瓷厂，扩建以后，今年的产量比1952年增加了一倍，质量也有了显著的提高。
