Xinhua News Agency, December 29th—Japanese Communist Party representatives Sanzo Nosaka, Yoshio Shiga, and Masao Iwama met with Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Eiichi Tanaka on the 28th, requesting the Japanese government to stop the U.S. military authorities from interfering with the People's Party Secretary-General Kamejiro Senaga's assumption of office as the Mayor of Naha on Okinawa Island. On the same day, the Japanese Communist Party also made a similar request to the U.S. Embassy. Senaga was elected by the people on December 25th to serve as the Mayor of Naha. He opposes the U.S. turning Okinawa Island into a military base.

In order to prevent Senaga from becoming mayor, the U.S. military authorities in Ryukyu are already interfering by despicable means. According to Agence France-Presse, after Senaga was elected Mayor of Naha, the U.S. military authorities immediately froze all of Naha City's deposits through the Ryukyu Central Bank, which is controlled by the United States, and stopped paying any funds to the Naha City government.

The U.S. military authorities are also instigating local forces in Naha City to oppose Kamejiro Senaga's assumption of office as mayor. Some members of the city council have declared that they will not cooperate with the People's Party mayor. Deputy Mayor Kadena and some section chiefs of the city government have submitted their resignations. They even propagandize that if Kamejiro Senaga is elected mayor, the U.S. military may interrupt "aid" to Naha city construction.

    美军阻挠人民党领袖出任那霸市长
    日共要求制止美军干涉内政
    新华社29日讯　日本共产党代表野坂参三、志贺义雄、岩间正男在28日会见内阁副官房长官田中荣一，要求日本政府制止美军当局干涉人民党书记长濑长龟次郎出任冲绳岛那霸市长。同一天，日本共产党向美国大使馆也提出了类似的要求。濑长是在12月25日被人民选举出来担任那霸市长的。他反对美国把冲绳岛军事基地化。
    琉球美军当局为了使濑长不能担任市长，已经在用卑鄙手段进行干涉。据法新社报道，在濑长当选那霸市长之后，美军当局立即通过为美国所控制的琉球中央银行冻结了那霸市的全部存款，并且停止支付一切款项给那霸市政府。
    美军当局并且唆使那霸市的地方势力反对濑长龟次郎出任市长。市议会的一些议员声明不和人民党的市长合作。副市长嘉手纳和市政府的一些科长们提出了辞职书。他们居然宣传说，濑长龟次郎当选市长以后，美军可能中断对那霸城市建设的“援助”。
