Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 13th - TASS reported from New York on December 13th: The United Nations Secretariat announced to the press on December 12th that the delegation of the People's Republic of Hungary to the United Nations had written to the UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, stating, "The Hungarian government reiterates its past statement that it is ready to negotiate with the UN Secretary-General. The government also reiterates the fact that it notified the UN Secretary-General on December 3rd that it was prepared to receive the Secretary-General in Budapest at a later time, at a mutually convenient moment. The Hungarian government also pointed out that December 16th—the date chosen by the UN Secretary-General for his visit to Budapest—was inconvenient for the Hungarian government. On the other hand, the Hungarian government will shortly make proposals through its representative in New York in order to reach an agreement on the Secretary-General's visit."

    准备接见哈马舍尔德
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约13日讯：联合国秘书处12日向新闻界宣布，匈牙利人民共和国驻联合国代表团写信给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德说，“匈牙利政府重申过去的声明，即准备同联合国秘书长谈判。政府还重申下述事实：政府曾经在12月3日通知联合国秘书长，表示准备在稍迟一些时候、在一个双方方便的时刻在布达佩斯接待秘书长。匈牙利政府还指出，12月16日——联合国秘书长选定的访问布达佩斯日期——对匈牙利政府说来是不方便的。另一方面，不久以后匈牙利政府将通过自己驻纽约代表提出建议，以就联合国秘书长访问一事达成协议”。
