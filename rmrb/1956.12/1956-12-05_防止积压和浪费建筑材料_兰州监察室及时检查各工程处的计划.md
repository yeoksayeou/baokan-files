Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, December 2nd. Since the beginning of this year, the Lanzhou Supervisory Office of the National Bureau of Construction Engineering Supervision has continuously inspected the Lanzhou Engineering Corporation and its subordinate engineering offices, avoiding the overstocking and waste of certain materials.

During the inspection, the Lanzhou Supervisory Office discovered that construction units generally underreported inventory and over-requested materials. For example, the Second Engineering Office, which was constructing the Lanzhou Waterworks, reported less than one-third of its actual steel inventory and less than half of its actual timber inventory when reporting inventory in August. The original plan for this project required 1,681 tons of cement and over 800 cubic meters of formwork. After inspection by the Lanzhou Supervisory Office, it was found that this project could only complete the foundation part in September, and the other parts were not in a condition to be completed at all. At that time, only 409 tons of cement and 24 cubic meters of formwork were needed. When the Materials and Technology Supply Department of the Lanzhou Engineering Corporation was balancing the September steel plan for each engineering office, it was estimated that 119 tons of small-sized rebar were lacking. However, after inspection by the Lanzhou Supervisory Office, it was found that there was not only no shortage of this type of rebar, but a surplus of more than 90 tons. At the same time, it was also found that five engineering offices underreported their inventory of small-sized rebar by more than 77 tons.

After discovering these problems, the Lanzhou Supervisory Office promptly held symposiums for business personnel or talked with individuals, sought evidence and made detailed calculations with them, patiently conducted persuasion and education, reversed the departmentalism and conservative thinking of some personnel, and corrected the errors of false reporting and fraudulent claims.

　　防止积压和浪费建筑材料
　　兰州监察室及时检查各工程处的计划
    新华社兰州2日电　建筑工程国家监察局兰州监察室，今年以来对兰州工程总公司和所属各工程处不断进行检查，避免了某些材料的积压和浪费。
    兰州监察室在检查中，发现各施工单位普遍有少报库存、多领材料的现象。如承建兰州自来水厂的第二工程处，8月份报库存的时候，所报钢材还不到实际库存的三分之一，木材也不到实际库存的一半。这个工程原计划需要水泥一千六百八十一吨、模板八百多立方公尺。经过兰州监察室检查后，发现这项工程在9月份只能完成基矿部分，其他部分根本没有条件完成，当时仅需水泥四百零九吨、模板二十四立方公尺。兰州工程总公司材料技术供应处在平衡各工程处9月份钢材计划的时候，统计缺少小规格的钢筋一百一十九吨。但是经过兰州监察室检查后，发现这种钢筋不但不缺，反而多余九十多吨。同时还检查出五个工程处少报库存小规格钢筋七十七吨多。
    兰州监察室发现这些问题以后，便及时开业务人员座谈会或找个别人员谈话，和他们找根据、算细账，耐心地进行说服教育，扭转了一些人员的本位主义和保守思想，纠正了虚报冒领的错误。
