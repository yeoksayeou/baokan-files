Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: A United Press dispatch from Paris on the 15th stated that, according to a "high-ranking diplomat," Western countries are brewing a "new" plan to resolve the Suez Canal issue. This plan will attempt to force Egypt to accept "a certain degree of internationalization" of the canal "in principle" under the pretext of "ensuring that the canal is not subject to the political influence of any country."

It is revealed that while recognizing Egypt's sovereignty and operational rights over the Suez Canal, the plan intends to require Egypt to allow the World Bank, controlled by the United States, to "fund" the work of improving the waterway. The plan also requires Egypt's Canal Authority to "cooperate" with canal user nations; in this regard, there are reports that the "Suez Canal Users Association" intends to send a representative to reside in the canal zone.

The report states that the United States, Britain, and France have secretly discussed this plan in Paris over the past few days and have consulted with some other canal user nations.

United Press International says that before leaving Paris to return to Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles specifically met with the chairman of the "Suez Canal Users Association," M. Bartels. It is said that the United States has expressed its determination to quickly resolve the canal issue "through the United Nations" and is determined to "provide as much assistance as possible" in this regard.

    西方在运河问题上玩弄新诡计
    仍然企图迫使埃及接受国际化计划
    新华社16日讯　合众社15日从巴黎发出的一条消息说，据一位“高级外交人士”透露，西方国家正在酝酿提出一个解决苏伊士运河问题的“新”计划，这个计划将设法在“保证运河不受任何国家的政治影响”的借口下迫使埃及在“原则上”接受运河“某种程度的国际化”。
    据透露，这个计划打算在承认埃及对苏伊士运河的主权和经营权的同时，要求埃及让美国控制的世界银行来“资助”改进这条水道的工作。计划还要求埃及的运河管理局同运河使用国“合作”；在这方面，有消息说，“运河使用国协会”打算派一个代表驻在运河区。
    消息说，美国、英国和法国在过去几天里曾经在巴黎秘密讨论过这个计划，并且同其他一些运河使用国进行了磋商。
    合众社说，美国国务卿杜勒斯在离巴黎回华盛顿以前，还特地为这件事会见了“运河使用国协会”的主席巴脱尔斯。据说，美国表示决心要“通过联合国”来迅速解决运河问题，并且决心在这方面“尽量提供帮助”。
