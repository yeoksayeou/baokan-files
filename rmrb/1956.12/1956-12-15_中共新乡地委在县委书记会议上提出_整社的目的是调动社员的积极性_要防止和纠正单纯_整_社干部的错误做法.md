The CCP Xinxiang Prefectural Committee Proposes at the County Party Secretary Meeting That the Purpose of Rectifying the Communes is to Mobilize the Enthusiasm of the Members; It is Necessary to Prevent and Correct the Erroneous Practice of Simply "Rectifying" Commune Cadres

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Henan Daily: Ten of the fourteen counties in the Xinxiang area of Henan Province have begun to systematically rectify agricultural production cooperatives in stages and batches. At the meeting of county party secretaries convened by the Prefectural Committee on November 30, it was pointed out that the fundamental purpose of rectifying the communes is to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the members and to do a good job in agricultural and sideline production and disaster relief work.

    The reason why the CCP Xinxiang Prefectural Committee emphasized this issue is based on the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the actual results of the previous stage of pilot work in rectifying communes in various counties in the Xinxiang area.

    In the previous stage of pilot work in rectifying thirty-six communes, two different methods of rectifying communes emerged.

    One is: to help commune cadres study relevant documents, improve the ideological understanding of party members and cadres; to promote democracy, summarize work, affirm achievements, and solve problems within the commune. In the Dafocun Commune of Yanjin County, during the rectification of the commune, eight cadres visited seventy-nine commune members, collected more than eighty constructive opinions from the commune members, and solved some problems such as the shortage of money and cotton clothes for commune members, and the problems left over from the establishment of the commune such as the ownership of reed pits. Commune members generally reflected: "The Communist Party's policy is truly clear and transparent, it is what it is." The Baichang Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanyang County had a cash income of more than 140,000 yuan, but only more than 90,000 yuan was distributed, and more than 50,000 yuan had not been distributed, which caused great dissatisfaction among the commune members, and it was distributed during the rectification of the commune. In Nan Zhangqiang Township, Wen County, because many problems raised by commune members were conscientiously solved through the rectification of the commune, the commune members said: "It would be good to rectify the commune several times a year like this." Obviously, using this method to rectify the commune achieves the purpose of mobilizing all positive factors.

    Although the other method of rectifying the commune is individual, it is worthy of attention. Cadres who adopted this method of rectifying the commune believed that: rectifying the commune is only to rectify the bad ones, and the achievements and experience of running the commune can be ignored. Their purpose in mobilizing the masses in the countryside is only to 'rectify' people. The Maying Commune in Boai County even divided the commune cadres into several people who made subjectivist errors, several people who made bureaucratic errors, and so on, and asked them to write written self-criticisms as much as possible. Facts have proved that adopting this method to rectify the commune not only fails to achieve the purpose of mobilizing all positive factors, but also generates new negative factors.

    The above two methods of rectifying the commune reflect two different guiding ideologies. Which way to go is related to the success or failure of the entire rectification work. The CCP Xinxiang Prefectural Committee emphasized that the fundamental purpose of rectifying the commune is to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the members, in order to prevent and overcome the erroneous practices in the rectification work and ensure that the rectification work and production work this winter and next spring are done well.

### 中共新乡地委在县委书记会议上提出  整社的目的是调动社员的积极性  要防止和纠正单纯“整”社干部的错误做法

    中共新乡地委在县委书记会议上提出
    整社的目的是调动社员的积极性
    要防止和纠正单纯“整”社干部的错误做法
    本报讯　据河南日报报道：河南新乡地区十四个县已经有十个县开始分期分批系统地整顿农业生产合作社。11月30日地委召开的各县县委书记会议指出：整社的根本目的在于充分地把社员的积极性调动起来，搞好农、副业生产和生产救灾工作。
    中共新乡地委所以强调提出这个问题，是以党的第八次全国代表大会的精神和新乡地区各县前段整社试点工作的实际结果为根据的。
    在前段三十六个社的整社试点工作中，出现了两种不同的整社方法。
    一种是：帮助社干部学习有关的文件，提高党员和干部的思想认识水平；发扬民主，总结工作，肯定成绩，解决社内问题。延津县大佛村社，在整社当中组织八个干部访问了七十九户社员，集中社员提出的建设性意见八十多条，解决了一部分社员缺钱、缺棉衣等问题，和苇坑所有权等建社遗留问题。社员普遍反映：“共产党的政策，真是青山绿水，是啥就是啥。”原阳县包厂农业社，十四万多元现金收入，只分了九万多元，还有五万多元未分，社员很有意见，在整社中分下去了。温县南张羌乡，因为通过整社认真地解决了社员提出的许多问题，社员们说：“像这样的整社，一年要多整几次才好。”很明显，运用这种办法整社，就达到了调动一切积极因素的目的。
    另一种整社方法虽然是个别的，但却值得注意。采用这种整社办法的干部认为：整社只是整坏的，办社的成绩经验可以不用管它。他们入乡发动群众，目的只是‘整’人。博爱马营社还把社干部划分成犯主观主义错误的几人，犯官僚主义错误的几人，等等，并要求他们尽量写出书面检讨。事实已经证明，采用这种办法整社，不但不能达到调动一切积极因素的目的，而且会产生新的消极因素。
    上述两种整社办法，反映着两种不同的指导思想。何去何从，关系着整个整社工作的成败。中共新乡地委强调提出整社的根本目的是在于充分调动社员的积极性这一点，就是为了防止和克服整社工作中的错误作法，保证做好今冬明春的整社工作和生产工作。
