Actively Acquire Scrap Steel
Shan Deqing, Deputy Director of the Materials Distribution Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Planning Committee

Jiangsu Province's machinery industry and handicrafts industry need a large amount of scrap steel as production raw materials every year. It is estimated that each piece of farm equipment requires half a kilogram of scrap steel. For this item alone, the province will need 30,000 tons of scrap steel this year. However, the amount allocated by the state is only about 30% of the demand. Due to the shortage of scrap steel supply, not long after the start of spring plowing production this year, there was a tense situation in the market with insufficient supply of small farm tools. In some areas, farmers went to the market three or four times without being able to buy the farm tools they needed. Some even traveled dozens of miles to the town the day before and stayed overnight to queue up to buy them the next morning.

Under these circumstances, the only way to solve the problem is to tap into the province's potential resources and strengthen the acquisition of scrap steel. However, many cadres are not confident in the work of acquiring scrap steel. They believe that scrap steel has been acquired for several years, so how can it "grow with continuous collection"? In order to find out the status of scrap steel resources, the Provincial Planning Commission, the Handicraft Industry Federation, and others have successively organized working groups to conduct key investigations. They found that in rural areas, the average household has 19 kilograms of scrap steel in places where there is a lot, and the average household has 3 kilograms in places where there is little. In urban areas, just in Nantong and Xuzhou, various scrap steel and shavings that have been buried underground for a long time amount to more than 400 tons. Facts have proved that the potential resources in the province are abundant, which has increased the confidence of the cadres.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the scrap steel acquisition work, acquisition points have been added in various parts of the province. For example, Zhenjiang Prefecture added 182 acquisition points this year. At the same time, in order to facilitate farmers to sell, a large number of private merchants and peddlers were also organized to go deep into the countryside to carry out acquisition work. Small vendors in Huashu Town, Jiangyin County, acquired more than 2,400 kilograms of scrap steel in January. Changshu City created the experience of "fixed person, fixed place, fixed time" acquisition by dividing areas and visiting regularly. In the acquisition work, emphasis was placed on the reasonable price policy of "pricing according to quality" and "high quality, high price," and the acquisition price was increased by about 50%. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of small vendors in acquisition, the handling fee was also increased from 6% to 8% to 15%.

Publicity and mobilization work is also very important. The Jiangsu Provincial People's Committee issued instructions to strengthen the acquisition of scrap steel. The Provincial Planning Commission and the Provincial Handicraft Industry Federation held meetings to make specific arrangements and mobilize at all levels. Suzhou City held a meeting for the heads of 250 units, and the mayor personally gave a mobilization report. Cities such as Nanjing conducted mobilization through residents' symposiums held by street offices. In rural areas, mobilization was carried out through meetings of commune members. In addition, publicity was carried out through local newspapers, radio, and blackboards, explaining that selling steel is "beneficial to oneself and meritorious to the country." Changshu City created the experience of "promoting, exhibiting, acquiring, and supplying at the same time," requiring that everyone knows and every household sells.

By the end of the third quarter of this year, the province had acquired 18,853 tons of scrap steel, and the estimated annual acquisition volume is about 25,000 tons, an increase of 20% compared with the acquisition volume in 1955. In this way, not only was the difficulty of insufficient steel raw materials for the industrial and handicraft departments in our province this year overcome, but the cost was reduced without reducing product quality. In addition, the surplus white pig iron and scrap steel were also transferred to support enterprises directly under the central government.

Of course, the acquisition of scrap steel in 1956 also had shortcomings. We did not make good use of small vendors, the acquisition tasks were not completed evenly, the connection between handicraft cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperative acquisition departments was poor, and some areas also had a purely profit-making viewpoint, and did not well implement the policy of "grading and pricing" and "high quality and high price," which to some extent affected the better development of scrap steel acquisition work.

    积极收购废钢铁
    江苏省计划委员会物资分配处副处长　单德清
    江苏省的机械工业和手工业，每年需要大量的废钢铁作生产原料。据估计，每件农具需耗用废钢铁半斤，只此一项，今年全省就需要废钢铁三万吨。而国家分配的数量只及需要量的30％左右。由于废钢铁供应不足，今年春耕生产开始不久，市场上小型农具就出现供不应求的紧张情况。有些地区农民上街三、四次买不到所需要的农具，有的甚至在前一天赶几十里路到镇上住下，第二天清晨去排队购买。
    在这种情况下，唯一解决问题的办法就是挖掘省内潜在资源，加强废钢铁的收购工作。但是，不少干部对收购废钢铁的工作信心不高。他们认为废钢铁已收购了几年，哪里会“长收长有”。省计划委员会、手工业联合社等为了摸清废钢铁资源情况，曾先后组织工作组，分别进行重点调查。发现在农村多的地方平均每户有废钢铁十九斤，少的地方平均每户也有三斤。在城市，仅南通、徐州两地就发现长期埋在地下的各种废钢铁、刨屑达四百吨之多。事实证明省内潜在资源是丰富的，从而提高了干部的信心。
    为了加强对废钢铁收购工作的领导，省内各地都增设了收购点，如镇江专区今年就增设了一百八十二个收购点。同时，为了便利农民出售，还组织了大批私商小贩深入农村、开展收购工作。江阴县华墅镇小商贩一月中收购了废钢铁两千四百多斤。常熟市创造了划分地区、定期上门的“定人、定地、定时”收购经验。在收购工作中，强调“按质论价”、“优质优价”的合理价格政策，并将收购价格提高了50％左右。为了鼓励小商贩收购的积极性，手续费也从6％提高到了8％至15％。
    宣传动员工作也很重要。江苏省人民委员会曾发出加强废钢铁收购工作的指示，省计划委员会、省手工业联合社曾召开会议，具体部署，层层动员。苏州市曾召开二百五十个单位的负责人开会，市长亲自做了动员报告。南京等城市通过街道办事处召开居民座谈会进行动员。农村通过社员大会进行动员。此外，还通过地方报、广播、黑板报进行宣传，说明出卖钢铁是“利在自己、功在国家”。常熟市创造了“边宣传、边展览、边收购、边供应”的经验，要求做到人人皆知、户户出售。
    到今年第三季度末，全省收购了废钢铁一万八千八百五十三吨，预计全年收购量在二万五千吨左右；较1955年的收购数量增加了20％。这样，不仅克服了今年我省工业和手工业部门钢铁原料不足的困难，在不降低产品质量的前提下，降低了成本，而且还将多余的白口生铁和废钢调拨支持了中央所属的企业。
    当然，1956年废钢铁的收购工作也是有缺点的。我们没有很好地运用小商贩，收购任务完成得也不平衡，手工业社与供销社收购部门的联系差，有的地区也有单纯的盈利观点，没有很好贯彻“分等论价”、“优质优价”的政策，这些都在一定程度上影响了更好地开展废钢铁收购工作。
