In Harbin's emerging industrial area, a brand-new factory has appeared: the Harbin Boiler Factory.

Boilers are not unfamiliar to people. Winter heating requires boilers to generate steam, and trains rely on the power of boiler steam to run. However, the boilers manufactured by the Harbin Boiler Factory are for thermal power plants. Boilers are divided into low-pressure, medium-pressure, high-pressure, and ultra-high-pressure types. The higher the pressure of the boilers used in thermal power plants, the more economical they are. In the past, China's only Shanghai Boiler Factory could only manufacture low-pressure boilers. The new-style boilers installed in newly built thermal power plants after liberation were mostly supplied by the Soviet Union. After the completion of the Harbin Boiler Factory, it will specialize in manufacturing medium and high-pressure boilers for power stations.

In order for our country to manufacture this type of boiler on its own in a very short period, the construction workers completed the construction of this factory at an amazing speed. During the construction of the main factory building, the original plan was to complete it in more than a year, but they completed it in eight months. The mechanized boiler room project, which was originally planned to be completed in a year and a half, also started operation and steam supply in only five and a half months.

Now, in the completed huge main factory building, the unique characteristics of a boiler manufacturing plant have emerged. The spacious boiler manufacturing area is filled with long steel pipes and large steel plates, which are the raw materials for manufacturing boilers as tall as six-story buildings. The technology for manufacturing boilers is very complex. A boiler requires dozens of steel pipes bent into various shapes. These steel pipes have different thicknesses, and even a slight difference in the bending angle will make them unqualified. It is also a very difficult task to roll steel plates several inches thick into cylinders and weld the seams at once to make the steam drums of the boiler. Although this factory has new Soviet-supplied equipment, mastering the technology of the new equipment is still an arduous process. Therefore, the workers of the Harbin Boiler Factory began to learn new boiler manufacturing techniques very early, striving to quickly manufacture various high-quality boilers for the country.

### 现代化的哈尔滨锅炉厂

    现代化的哈尔滨锅炉厂
    新华社记者　孙若刚
    在哈尔滨新兴的工业区里，又出现了一座崭新的工厂——哈尔滨锅炉厂。
    锅炉对人们来说并不是一个陌生的东西，冬季取暖需要有锅炉来蒸发蒸汽，火车的奔跑要依靠锅炉蒸汽的力量；但是，哈尔滨锅炉厂制造的锅炉是火力发电站用的锅炉。锅炉分为低压、中压、高压、超高压等种类。火力发电站用的锅炉压力愈大愈经济。过去我国仅有的上海锅炉厂能够制造低压锅炉，解放以后新建的火力发电站里安装的新式锅炉，大都是由苏联供应的。哈尔滨锅炉厂建成以后，将专门制造电站用的中压、高压锅炉。
    为了使我国能够在很短时期内自己制造这种锅炉，建设工人们曾经用惊人的速度完成着这个厂的建设。在建设主厂房的时候，原定计划要一年以上才能够建成，他们却用八个月的时间就完成了。原来计划要一年半完成的机械化锅炉房工程，也只用五个半月就开始运转送汽。
    现在在已经建成的巨大主厂房里，出现了锅炉制造厂独有的特点，宽阔的制造锅炉的地方，堆放着长长的钢管和大块的钢板，它们是制造像六层楼房那样高大的锅炉的原材料。制造锅炉的技术是很复杂的。一台锅炉需要几十根弯成各种形状的钢管，这些钢管有粗有细，弯的角度稍差一点就不合格。把几寸厚的钢板卷成圆筒、并且要一次把焊缝焊好做成锅炉的汽包，也是十分艰巨的工作。虽然这个厂有着苏联供应的新式设备，但如何掌握新设备的技术，仍旧是个艰苦的过程。因此，哈尔滨锅炉厂的职工很早就开始学习制造锅炉的新技术，争取很快地为国家制造出各种质量优良的锅炉。
