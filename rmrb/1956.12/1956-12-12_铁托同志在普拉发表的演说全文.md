Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 11th Dispatch: Belgrade News: The Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" published on November 6th the speech made by Josip Broz Tito, General Secretary of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, to activists of the League of Communists of Istria at the Yugoslav People's Army Club in Pula on November 11th. The full text is as follows:

Comrades!

Yesterday, I expressed my hope to take advantage of my convalescence in Brioni to come here and talk to you about our views on the current very complex international issues.

You all read the newspapers, but newspapers cannot cover everything and explain it comprehensively, especially the newspapers do not explain the reasons for the events happening in Hungary today and the events in Egypt—where the Israeli-French-British aggression took place. The current situation is quite complex, and we cannot say that there is no certain danger of a large-scale conflict occurring at present, but the peace-loving forces in the world—including our country—have shown in the United Nations that, relying on their unremitting efforts, they can reduce the possibility of international conflicts occurring, and they have made the world able to hope that peace can still be maintained.

First of all, I would like to talk about the events happening in Hungary today and the events that happened in Poland, so that we can have a correct understanding of these events. These events are very complex, especially in Hungary. There, a large part of the working class and progressive people took up arms and fought the Soviet armed forces in the streets. When Hungarian workers and progressive elements began to oppose the methods of Rakosi and the further implementation of this line with demonstrations, then with resistance and armed actions, I firmly believe that there is no question of counter-revolutionary tendencies. It can only be said that it is regrettable and sad that the reactionaries were able to find very fertile ground there, gradually turning things to their advantage and using the legitimate resistance that occurred in Hungary to achieve their own purposes.

The Roots of the Events in Poland and Hungary

You generally know the reasons that caused the events in Poland and Hungary. It is necessary for us to go back to 1948, when Yugoslavia was the first to give Stalin a strong answer, when Yugoslavia said that it wanted to maintain its independence, that it wanted to build its life and socialism according to the specific conditions in its country, and that it would not allow anyone to interfere in its internal affairs. Of course, there was no armed intervention at that time, because Yugoslavia was already united. Because we had already eliminated the main force of the reactionaries in the People's Liberation War, various reactionaries could not carry out various provocations. Secondly, we had a very strong and rock-solid communist party, which had been tempered in the pre-war period and the People's Liberation War, and we also had a strong and tempered army, and, most importantly, we had the unity of the people, which embodied all of this.

Once the truth about our country became known, the period of restoring normal relations with those countries that had severed relations with us after the passage of those disgraceful resolutions began, and the leaders of the Eastern countries expressed the hope that we would no longer mention what had been done to us and that we would not dwell on the past. We agreed to this entirely in order to improve relations with these countries as soon as possible. But you will see later that it is indeed necessary to remind those countries that are now beginning to slander us again, those people who occupy leading positions in the communist parties of the Eastern countries and even some Western countries, of what they did to Yugoslavia in the past four or five years, or even longer. At that time, we had to fight in all aspects to safeguard the achievements of our people's revolution, to safeguard what we had begun to build—the foundation of socialism, in a word, to wash away the shame that they hoped to impose on us with all sorts of slanders and to prove where the truth lay. We should remind them that it was these people who condemned our country in every possible way at that time, saying that our country was fascist, that we were bloodthirsty people, that we were destroying our people, that our working people did not support us, and so on. Today they want to push the responsibility for the events in Poland and Hungary onto our shoulders again, and we should remind them to remember this. This tendency of perfidy originates from those stubborn Stalinists who try to continue to maintain their positions within the parties of various countries, and they once again hope to consolidate their rule and impose this Stalinist tendency on their people, and even on the people of other countries. I will talk about this later. Now I only want to tell you that we must look at the Hungarian events based on the entire development situation.

The Problem Is Not Just the Cult of Personality, But the System That Allows the Cult of Personality to Arise

Due to the hopes and initiatives of the Soviet Union, we restored normal relations with the Soviet Union. After Stalin's death, the new leaders of the Soviet Union saw that, due to Stalin's stupidity, the Soviet Union was in a very difficult situation, in a dead end, both in foreign policy and domestic policy, and, due to Stalin's fault-finding and forced adoption of his methods, in other people's democratic countries as well. They understood the main reason for all these difficulties, and they condemned Stalin's actions and his policies up to that time at the Twentieth Congress, but they mistakenly treated the whole thing as a problem of the cult of personality, rather than as a problem of the system. And the cult of personality is actually a product of a system. They did not fight against this system, or, that is to say, they fought against it in secret, while verbally saying that, in general, everything was fine, but that recently, because Stalin was old, he began to be a bit foolish and made various mistakes.

From the beginning, we said that this is not just a problem of the cult of personality, but a problem of the system that allows the cult of personality to arise. The root lies here, and this is what needs to be constantly and persistently eradicated, and this is also the most difficult thing to do. Where are these roots? They lie in the bureaucratic organizations, in the leadership methods and the so-called one-man leadership system, in the neglect of the role and wishes of the working masses, in various Enver Hoxhas, Shehus, and other leaders of parties in some Western and Eastern countries who resist democratization and the resolutions of the Twentieth Congress, and they have contributed a lot to the consolidation of the Stalinist system, and they are now trying to restore this system so that it can continue to prevail. The root lies here, and this is what needs to be corrected.

Besides Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Moscow Declaration Is for More Countries to Apply

As far as we are concerned, we have made great efforts in our relations with the Soviet Union. We have improved relations, concluded a whole set of economic agreements, which are very beneficial to us, and are based on very favorable conditions, and so on. At the same time, two declarations were passed, one in Belgrade and one in Moscow. These two declarations should have practical significance not only for the mutual relations between our two countries, but also for the relations between all socialist countries. However, regrettably, these two declarations have not been understood in this way. Some people think: Well, since the Yugoslavs are so determined, we will respect and implement these two declarations, but these two declarations have nothing to do with other countries. Because the situation there is a bit different from Yugoslavia after all. Yugoslavia is an organized and disciplined country. The Yugoslavs have shown that they are worthy, and even in the most difficult moments, they have remained unyielding and have not allowed the capitalist system to be restored, and so on. That is to say, they are different from the people in your Eastern countries, where we put you in power. And this is wrong. Because those elements that caused Yugoslavia to resist in 1948 also exist in these Eastern countries, in Poland, in Hungary, and even in other places, some more, some less. When we were drafting the declaration on the relations between our parties—mainly between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—in Moscow, this encountered some difficulties. On this point, we could not completely agree, but even so, a declaration was passed, which, in our opinion, is for a larger scope of application besides Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. We have always reminded that those tendencies that had previously caused such strong resistance in Yugoslavia exist in all countries, and one day they will manifest themselves in other countries, and then it will be even more difficult to correct.

As you know, Khrushchev came here to rest. We held talks here that time, and more detailed talks in Belgrade. Because I, Comrade Rankovic, and Comrade Pucar were invited to Crimea, we went and continued the talks. We saw that this would encounter some difficulties for other countries, because the Soviet leaders held a different attitude towards other countries, because they had some wrong and flawed views on relations with these countries, with Poland, Hungary, and so on. However, we were not very pessimistic about this, because we saw that this was not the attitude of the entire Soviet leadership, but the attitude of a part of the people, who to some extent forced the other part to accept this attitude. We saw that this attitude was imposed by those who in the past generally stood on the Stalinist position and still stand on this position now, but, despite this, those who advocated a more vigorous and rapid development in democratization, who advocated abandoning all Stalinist methods, establishing new relations between socialist countries, and the development in this respect should also occur in foreign policy, it is still possible for these elements to achieve victory within the Soviet leadership through internal evolution. We saw from some signs, from the talks, that these elements are not weak, they are strong, but this internal development process towards progress, towards abandoning Stalinist methods was hindered, and also hindered by some Western countries, which interfered in the internal affairs of these countries and hindered the rapid development and improvement of relations between these countries because of their propaganda and constant repetition of the need to "liberate" these countries. Because the Soviet Union believes that, because this interference in internal affairs has reached a considerable scale in radio propaganda, transporting items by balloons, etc., if they completely let go of these countries and let them—for example—obtain the same status as Yugoslavia, then unpleasant consequences would arise. They were worried that in these countries, the reactionary forces might win. In other words, this means that they do not have enough trust in the internal revolutionary forces of these countries. I think this is wrong, and the root of all these subsequent mistakes lies in not having enough trust in the socialist forces of the people of these countries.

Our Activities Have Been Very Active and Beneficial

When things developed to the Poznan incident that you are all familiar with, there was a sudden change in the attitude towards us among the Soviets. They began to become cold. They thought that this incident was to blame on us Yugoslavs. Yes, we are to blame, because we live in this world, because we have this current situation, because we have built a Yugoslavia like this, because the influence of its activities has reached beyond our borders. Even if we do not want this, our country will still be active, and very active and beneficial. Despite all kinds of persecutions and the adoption of Stalinist methods of destroying cadres, Poland still left a core of leaders headed by Gomulka, who powerfully grasped the situation at the Eighth Plenary Session, boldly adopted their own new path—that is, striving for democratization, striving for their complete independence but also striving for good relations with the Soviet Union, and firmly resisting interference in their internal affairs. Due to this situation in Poland, the necessarily existing reactionary forces did not openly raise their heads, and this force has always hoped to raise its head when conflicts occur among the communists. Due to the mature consideration and attitude of the Soviet leaders—who stopped interfering at the appropriate moment—the situation in Poland has now greatly stabilized and is developing quite well.

I cannot say what kind of welcome this positive development in Poland, which is very similar to ours, has received in other countries of the "socialist camp." On the contrary, it has been criticized, but in private, among themselves, but also publicly to some extent. In these countries, Poland has not even received as much support as it has received from the Soviet leaders who have already agreed to Poland's attitude. Among those leading figures in some countries of the "socialist camp," and even among some communist parties in the West, Poland has not been understood, because Stalinists still hold power there.

When that self-proclaimed professor of history lectured in France and said that Yugoslavia was an insidious agent of imperialism, when those in power in the French Communist Party put forward such serious accusations in front of thousands upon thousands of people in such a tragic and difficult time, then would this be a guarantee that the cause of socialism would develop correctly in the future? No. The excesses of these irresponsible degenerates should be the responsibility of the leaders of that party. Or, for example, a self-proclaimed Marxist like Enver Hoxha, who knows nothing but to talk about "Marxism-Leninism" verbally, wrote an article about Yugoslavia, although he did not mention Yugoslavia by name, but it was attacking Yugoslavia and Poland. In the article, he firmly condemned the tendency to choose roads and development according to their own specific conditions, and even opposed what Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders had already recognized—that there are various specific roads to socialism. Such a way not only dares to slander and oppose Yugoslavia and another great socialist country, but even attacks the Soviet leaders themselves. This Stalinist believes that they can find a Stalin-branded figure in the Soviet Union to support them and help them continue to ride on the heads of their people. Comrades, this attitude is fatal.

When we were in Moscow, we certainly also talked about Poland, Hungary and other countries. We said that the Rakosi regime and Rakosi himself were not qualified to lead Hungary and promote internal unity; on the contrary, all they could do was cause serious consequences. Unfortunately, the Soviet comrades did not believe us, saying that Rakosi was an old revolutionary, honest, and so on. Saying that he was old—there was no problem with that—but that was not enough. Saying that he was honest—as far as I know, I cannot confirm this, especially after the Rajk trial and everything else. For me, these people are the most dishonest people in the world. The Soviet comrades said that he was prudent, that he would succeed, and that they did not know who else in that country they could trust. Precisely because our policy, both state and party, opposes interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and in order not to conflict with the Soviet comrades, we did not fully argue with the Soviet leaders to get rid of the Rakosi and Gero clique.

Gero Is No Different from Rakosi in the Slightest

When I went to Moscow, people were very surprised why I did not go through Hungary. It was precisely because of Rakosi that I was unwilling to do so. I said that I did not intend to go through Hungary, even if it would shorten the journey by three times. When the communist ranks themselves in that country showed increasing dissatisfaction, when they demanded that Rakosi step down, the Soviet comrades realized that things could not continue like this, and they agreed to replace Rakosi. However, they made a mistake: they did not let Gero and other Rakosi followers who had lost their prestige in the eyes of the people be replaced as well. They put forward the condition: only by retaining Gero could they agree to replace Rakosi. And this was a mistake, because Gero was no different from Rakosi in the slightest. He pursued the same policies, and he was as guilty as Rakosi.

Comrades, you see, what could we do? We could see that things were not going the way they should. When we were in Crimea, Gero "happened" to be there, and we "accidentally" ran into him. We held talks with him. Gero condemned the previous policies, saying that they were wrong, that they had smeared Yugoslavia, in short, he took all the blame, and asked to establish good relations, promising that all the previous mistakes would be corrected and the old policies would no longer be adopted. We wanted to show that we did not bear grudges and that we were not narrow-minded, so we agreed to hold talks with Gero and the delegation of the Hungarian Working People's Party that was preparing to come to Yugoslavia. We hoped to establish relations with the Hungarian Working People's Party, because we hoped not to isolate the Hungarian party, so that it would be easier to exert influence and promote correct development in the country.

However, the situation had developed much further—this was something we had not expected—so that Gero's visit to Yugoslavia and the joint statement we issued had no effect. The Hungarian people were absolutely opposed to the Stalinists who were still in power, and they demanded that these people be replaced and that democratization policies be adopted. When the Hungarian delegation led by Gero returned home, Gero found himself in a difficult situation, and he revealed his former face. He called the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who were still only holding demonstrations at the time "mobs," which almost insulted the entire nation. Think about how foolish he was, think about what kind of leader he was. At such a critical moment, when everything was in chaos, when the whole country was dissatisfied, he dared to use the word "mob" to slander the people, and a large number, maybe even the majority, of these people were communists and youth. This was enough to ignite the powder keg and cause an explosion. Then, the conflict followed. It is a serious mistake to ask foreign troops to teach their own people a lesson. It is meaningless to investigate who fired the first shot now. The troops were invited by Gero. It was a fatal mistake to invite the Soviet army while the demonstrations were still going on. It is a serious mistake to ask foreign troops to teach their own people a lesson. This move further angered the people, so a spontaneous riot occurred, in which the communists found themselves, against their will, standing with various reactionaries. Reactionaries mixed in this riot and used it to achieve their own purposes. Weren't there many Horthy elements in it? Who transformed them? Could it be expected that Rakosi would transform them? We all know that Horthy had strong fascist forces in Hungary, with "swastika" organizations, all kinds of other reactionaries, Ferenc Nagy's followers, and so on. In short, there was a large number of people who did not approve of communism, and they opposed not only Rakosi, but also the entire socialism. All these people mixed into this riot. In the past, although foreign countries wanted them to riot, and although they received assistance from abroad, these reactionary forces did not dare to raise their heads, and as long as they felt that the party was as united as a rock, they did not have the strength and courage to rebel. But as soon as they saw that the party was split, and a large number of party members rose up against the Rakosi group and the remnants of the past, they immediately stepped in.

These reactionary forces quickly revealed their true colors in two or three days. Because in the riot of the entire people against all the practices of the past, the leaders in power did not express their willingness to eliminate the factors that angered the Hungarian people, thereby starting to move along the road of truly developing socialism in Hungary, taking into account all the internal specific aspects of Hungary, things quickly changed differently, and the reactionaries began to gain more and more power. This legitimate rebellion and uprising against a group became a national riot against socialism and against the Soviet Union. When the counter-revolutionaries took control of the situation, the communists who participated in this rebellion finally realized helplessly that the struggle they participated in was not for socialism but for restoring the old system. They found themselves in such a situation against their will.

Was it possible to prevent this situation now? It seemed to be too late. If the Nagy government had been more vigorous, if it had not wavered, if it had stood firm against anarchy, preventing the reactionaries from massacring communists, if it had carried out a firm resistance against the reactionaries... perhaps the situation would have developed in the right direction, perhaps there would have been no Soviet military intervention. And what did Nagy do? He called on the people to take up arms to resist the Soviet army, and called on Western countries to intervene.

In the West, the Soviet intervention was fully utilized. The imperialists who were eager to attack Egypt took advantage of this intervention. They attacked Egypt precisely at this stage of the Hungarian tragedy, and they attacked Egypt in the hope that the Soviet Union would have difficulty dividing its attention and therefore would not be able to intervene in this aggression. Then, the battle in Hungary started again. The Soviet army received reinforcements. Nagy fled, and a new government was established at the same time. Comrades, I can tell you that I know the members of this new government, and in my opinion, they represent the most honest people in Hungary. They were persecuted during the Rakosi era, they were imprisoned, and they sincerely support new developments. The program announced by Kadar, which you have already read, itself proves this. However, the Soviet intervention weakened the entire program, so the government is in a very difficult situation.

Regarding the Soviet Intervention in Hungary

Now some people may ask, was the Soviet intervention necessary? The first intervention was unnecessary. The first intervention at Gero's request was absolutely wrong. The second mistake was: those responsible waited for the second intervention, and did not immediately take the actions they later took when the Soviet Union carried out the second intervention—that is, they should have formed a new government and issued a declaration. If they had initially established a new government and issued such a declaration, the workers and communists would have separated themselves from the reactionaries, thereby making it easier to find a way out of this serious situation.

Before I talk about the second Soviet military intervention, I must say that the situation in Hungary had reached such a scale—you have seen a lot of news about this situation—that there would obviously be a terrible massacre, a terrible civil war, and in this massacre and civil war, socialism would be completely buried, and a third world war would break out because of it. Because that kind of intervention from the West and the re-election of Horthy elements and former reactionaries were intolerable to the Soviet government.

What did these reactionary elements do? I have just said that they revealed their true colors very early on. It was very obvious that they were increasingly dominating the upper echelons, and began to ban the use of the word "comrade" and demanded the removal of the red star. When a communist party member cannot say that he is a communist party member, otherwise he will be killed, this is very obvious, and the fact that communist party members were hanged alive also makes this very obvious. If this kind of incident had only happened once, if a certain police officer who they hanged was a notorious evildoer, then perhaps it could be said that this incident happened as a result of the spontaneous resistance of a group of people. However, what happened was a universal massacre. In Sopron, they hanged twenty communist party members. They openly caught people and killed them on the streets, if these people were wearing yellow leather shoes, because the police wore yellow leather shoes. They broke into houses and killed communist party members. All of this was done by barbaric fascist reactionary thugs.

The Nagy government did nothing to prevent this behavior. It continued to cry and call for help on the radio, but did not launch a struggle against this behavior, expressing in some way its determination to stop the massacre of communist party members and progressive people. It did not do that, but issued a declaration in which it withdrew from the Warsaw Treaty and declared its independence, and so on. As if this was the most important thing at the time, as if its withdrawal from the Warsaw Treaty was meaningful.

Many people are now raising the question: why did the second Soviet military intervention occur? It is very obvious, we have said and will continue to say: we are against intervention, against the use of foreign armed forces. But now which is the lesser of two evils? Is it chaos, civil war, counter-revolution and a new world war, or the Soviet military intervention (which in fact happened)? If it is the former, it would be a great disaster; if it is the latter, it would be a mistake. Of course, if doing so means that socialism in Hungary can be saved, then, comrades, although we are against intervention, we can say that the Soviet military intervention was necessary. But, if they had done what they should have done earlier, then there would have been no need for military intervention. This error was unfortunately caused by their idea that military force can solve everything. But in fact, military force did not solve everything. Look, people who are empty-handed and poorly armed, when they are determined to achieve a goal—to fight for their own liberation and independence—will make such fierce resistance. They no longer care what kind of independence they want to achieve, and no longer care whether a bourgeois reactionary system will be restored, all they care about is that national independence should be maintained. This idea is dominant among the people. Of course, I can only say now that the first thing is the worst thing that could have happened, and the second thing—the Soviet military intervention—is also not good; but, if it can enable socialism to be preserved in Hungary, that is to say, can further build socialism in that country, and can lead to world peace, then one day this will become a good thing, but the condition is: once the situation in that country is stable and peaceful, the Soviet army will withdraw immediately.

We have said this to the Soviet comrades. We have not hidden anything. The Soviet comrades said that their troops would then withdraw. It should be remembered: the Soviet Union is now also in a difficult situation. Their eyes have now been opened; they have found that it is not only Horthy elements who are fighting, but also workers in industrial and mining enterprises; they have found that the entire nation is fighting. The Soviet soldiers will not be in a happy mood when they go there. The tragedy lies here.

After I have finished reporting, you can ask questions, because I may not have made everything very clear. But you can rest assured: we have never advised them to use troops. We have never made such advice, and we will not do so even now when they are in crisis. In this serious situation, we can only tell them that they should pay attention to correcting the mistakes of the past. This is the heart of the matter. Therefore, we must put out those rumors circulating in our country that the Soviet military intervention is purely an interventionist action. This statement is not correct. Comrades, I am deeply convinced of this.

I fully believe that the blood shed in Hungary and the terrible sacrifices made by the Hungarian people will have a positive impact, and the Soviet comrades, and even those Stalinists, will understand and realize that things cannot be done that way any longer. What we are saddened by—what we are all saddened by—is that socialism has suffered such a terrible blow. It has been damaged. And do you, comrades, remember that we often said that this method would only damage socialism? We did say these things. I don't want everyone to pat their chests and say happily now: "We told you so a long time ago."

The Hungarian Events May Be the Last Tragedy

Regarding this tragedy, I have one thing to say: if those irresponsible elements who rely on Stalinist methods and still hold power in the communist parties of various countries advise the Soviet Union to act according to their ideas, it is actually a very bad support for the Soviet Union. I think that in all these parties, there must be honest communist party members who can see further than these many Stalinists. They really have to see further. And if they want to improve the situation there, not in the Hungarian way, but in a peaceful communist way, then they should criticize the negative things, listen to the voices of the masses, the voices of the party members, and the voices of the people of the whole country. Because, if these prophets and counselors continue to carry out activities in a destructive way, if they think it is necessary to slander our country in every possible way and continue to insult us, then socialism will certainly encounter more difficult moments. Yugoslavia stands very firmly. It has undergone many blows so far, so these slanders from abroad will not make it deviate from its own path. Although we are not completely satisfied with our domestic development situation, we will try our best to satisfy our people as much as possible. No matter what we are now and will be in the future, we must redouble our efforts to prevent these prophets and counselors from realizing their attempts to stop the process that Yugoslavia started in 1948 and is currently continuing in Poland, and we must not let them guide this process onto the Stalinist track.

Once I told the Soviet comrades that even if Stalin had not died, this would have happened, and if he were alive, it would have happened even faster. They do not deny this. We have no right to tell them what to do or not to do, we can only point out the possible wrong and negative consequences of their actions. I believe that the Hungarian events may be the last tragedy, prompting the Soviet comrades and the leaders of other countries who still cannot see this, to do everything possible to avoid the same situation as the current situation in Hungary from happening in other countries.

In some countries and parties in Eastern Europe, some leaders are saying that this is impossible to happen in their country, they say that they have a strong organization, a strong army, and a strong police force; they say that all their party members already know everything; they say that they can control the entire situation. Gero also said this; Rakosi also said this. But what help did this give them? If they do not change their working methods, it will not help at all if the people rise up in resistance one day. The seeds they sowed since 1948 are now being harvested. They sowed the wind in the beginning, but now they are reaping the whirlwind! (Long applause)

Our Development Prospects and Current Tasks

These events in Hungary have somewhat encouraged various people and elements that also exist in our country. They are few in number, but they talk a lot. Some of them simply dream of chaos so that they can profit from it. I have never said that we have completely eliminated and transformed all the Ustasha elements, Chetnik elements, and those stubborn supporters of the Vatican. I have always said that only the unity of the people can prevent them from making any attempts or achieving any success in our country. Today, the unity of the people and the party is more necessary than ever before, but this is not because we are afraid that something might happen in our country, because Yugoslavia is different from Hungary or any other country after all. We carried out our revolution through our own bloodshed, through the liberation struggle, and we have thoroughly cleared our interior during the revolution. There is no such danger in our country.

I will never say that our people are completely satisfied, and everything in our country is satisfactory. And even I myself am not satisfied. However, the situation in Yugoslavia is very different—there are prospects in our country, and the working people of Yugoslavia are constantly creating more distant prospects. In addition, what makes me feel dissatisfied? Comrades, you will remember that I made a report last year in which I pointed out that the direction of our investment policy must be changed. I am deeply convinced that the people who manage our economy will remember this, and we should seriously care about the living standards of our people first. In this regard, there has been some change, the market has been stabilized to a certain extent, and the soaring prices—which may cause inflation—have been stopped, but not everything I expected has been done. We have now decided again to more vigorously curb the tendency to only engage in construction. We must now strive to improve living standards while also strengthening our national defense. These two are the most important, and we must pay attention to them. This is what I want to say in this regard.

Now I would like to talk about various elements—various elements existing in our country. Their idea is this: "Now there is turmoil in Hungary, and the Horthy elements and Vatican elements and other elements will seize power there, and this is an opportunity for us." According to them, Yugoslavia will once again be isolated and surrounded, and they will be able to carry out activities in Yugoslavia more smoothly. There are still such elements now, but I want to say that they are very wrong. Because, there are not 800,000 party members in our party—Gero said that their party had 800,000 party members, and after hearing this sentence, I looked at him and felt a little skeptical—but we have about 600,000 party members, who are cadres who have been tested in revolution and struggle. They did not join our party with various pursuits of status and other tendencies, and they all bear the heavy responsibility of building our country on their shoulders. They will always know how to stop anyone who may want to destroy our country in a timely manner. In our country, there is the League of Communists, which has more than 600,000 members, and the Socialist Alliance of Working People, which has 7 million members.

These 7 million people are all conscious builders of socialism. They have their own program and know what their goals are. These 7 million people can express their opinions at any time if they think that things cannot continue like this, if they think that we cannot continue to invest such huge amounts of money in basic construction, or if they think that this or that thing is necessary. Of course, neither I nor our entire leadership has the right to oppose this desire of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, that is: our country should be built at the speed that can be achieved today. Comrades, you know, when you encounter these problems every day, when you see that if this or that factory is built, it will produce results tomorrow that will immediately improve the situation, when you see that it only takes a few million more investment to ensure a large increase in production, when you only see this, those other things—our people—are somewhat neglected. You only see the factory and not the people.

Obviously, we are still in a difficult situation. There is a large deficit in our foreign trade, and this deficit is still increasing, although in the past year and a half, we have concluded some quite favorable agreements, mainly with the Soviet Union, agreements with very favorable terms, that is, large loans obtained at a 2% interest rate. Secondly, we have concluded an agreement on the method of payment of German reparations. Czechoslovakia has written off—that is, offsetted—100 million US dollars, and the debt with Hungary will be resolved according to its possibilities. Due to the conclusion of these agreements, we have improved the construction situation. Finally, we have used credit to obtain wheat and certain raw materials from the United States worth about 100 million US dollars. Our situation is not as difficult as some people hope to portray it. There will be no shortage of grain and bread. In our country, the market is somewhat disordered, because these people are too inattentive to trying to ensure that the market is adequately supplied. Although there are very favorable conditions for this throughout the country. Take Belgrade as an example, near this city is the Pancevacki Rit farm, where there are extremely suitable conditions for growing vegetables. Many counties and other communes (the lowest administrative unit in Yugoslavia—translator's note) can produce a large number of consumer goods for the market, but they do not produce these things. For example, vegetables are currently being transported from Ljubljana to Koper. What kind of policy is this, because we know that Koper used to supply Trieste with vegetables. There are some of these bad phenomena in our country.

We Must Help the Kadar Government Today

Comrades, I have slightly deviated from the issue I was talking to you about. I want to tell you that from the perspective of whether the future is socialism or counter-revolution, we must defend Kadar's current government, we must help it. We should help it because it is in a very difficult situation. We must oppose all those elements who are now irresponsibly blaming all the mistakes on the Russians. Yes, the Soviet comrades did not discover and correct the mistakes of the Rakosi regime in advance, and did not allow those who had the trust of the working class and the entire people to be able to govern. They should be responsible for these situations. Because no one can forcibly impose a leader on a nation—that cannot be done.

In Poland, the situation has begun to stabilize, but it is not very solid. The same elements are also active there, and these elements are against Poland having good relations with the Soviet Union. You know that the Poles who have reactionary ideas hate the Russians and the Soviet Union. The Polish people must be freed from this reactionary force that hates both the Soviet Union and socialism itself. Because the Polish working class and communist party members have a long-term vision and know what support they can get from the Soviet Union. For example, without the support of the Soviet Union, it would be difficult for the Poles to defend the Oder-Neisse line border, and the Germans have never recognized this border, and they will make demands on this border again. In short, what is needed in this regard is mutual help and support.

Similarly, we must maintain the closest contact with the Polish government and party, and do everything in our power to help them. We must work with the Polish comrades to oppose the tendency that has emerged within the parties of other countries—whether Eastern or Western countries. Comrades, this struggle will be difficult and long-term, because the actual issue involved is: will the new trend win in the communist parties of various countries—this trend actually started in Yugoslavia, and the resolutions of the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union created quite a few factors for this trend. The question now is:

    铁托同志在普拉发表的演说全文
    新华社布拉格11日电　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫“战斗报”11月6日刊载了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟总书记约瑟夫·布罗兹·铁托于11月11日在普拉南斯拉夫人民军俱乐部向伊斯特里亚的共产主义者联盟积极分子发表的演说，全文如下：同志们！
    昨天我曾经表示希望利用我在布里俄尼治病的机会，到你们这里来，向你们谈一谈我们对于目前非常错综复杂的国际问题的看法。
    你们都读报纸，可是报纸并不能包罗一切而加以全面的说明，特别是报纸上没有说明今天匈牙利所发生的事件以及在埃及——在那里，发生了以色列—法国—英国的侵略——发生的事件的原因。今天的形势相当复杂，我们不能说目前不存在发生大规模冲突的一定危险，但是世界上爱好和平的力量——我国也是其中之一——已经在联合国中表明，依靠它们坚持不懈的努力，它们能够减少发生国际冲突的可能性，而且它们已经使得世界能够希望和平仍然能够保持。
    首先，我愿意谈一谈今天匈牙利所发生的事件和波兰发生过的事件，这样我们对于这些事件就会有一个正确的概念。这些事件非常复杂，特别是在匈牙利。在那里，很大一部分工人阶级和进步人士手执武器在街头同苏联武装部队发生了战斗。当匈牙利工人和进步分子开始以示威、接着以抵抗和武装行动来反对拉科西的方法，来反对进一步执行这个路线的时候，我深信，是谈不上反革命倾向的。人们只能说，反动派竟能够在那里找到非常肥沃的土壤，使事情逐渐对自己有利，利用匈牙利发生的正当反抗来达到自己的目的，这是令人遗憾的和可悲的。
    波兰和匈牙利事件的根源
    你们大体上知道造成波兰和匈牙利事件的原因。我们有必要回溯到1948年，当时南斯拉夫第一个给斯大林一个有力的答复，当时南斯拉夫说，它希望保持独立，它希望按照它国内的具体情况来建设它的生活和社会主义，它不允许任何人干涉它的内政。当然，当时没有发生武装干涉，因为南斯拉夫已经是团结一致的。由于我们在人民解放战争中已经消灭了反动派的主力，各种反动分子无法进行各种的挑衅。其次，我们有着一个非常强大的、磐石般团结一致的共产党，它经过了战前时期和人民解放战争时期的锻炼，我们也有着一支强大的和经过锻炼的军队，而且，最重要的是，我们有着体现了这一切的人民的团结。
    一旦关于我国的真相大白，同那些在那不光采的决议通过之后跟我们断绝了关系的国家恢复正常关系的时期就开始了，东方国家的领导人表示，希望我们不再提起对我们所作的事，希望我们不究既往，我们同意了，这完全是为了尽速改善同这些国家的关系。但是你们后来就会看到，对于那些今天又在开始诽谤我们的国家，那些在东方国家的、甚至某些西方国家的共产党中占居领导地位的某些人们，的确是有必要提醒一下，他们在过去这四、五年里，甚至更久一些，对南斯拉夫所做的事。当时我们不得不在各方面进行斗争，来维护我们人民革命的成就，维护我们已经开始建设的东西——社会主义基础，一句话，洗雪他们希望用各种各样的诽谤加在我们身上的耻辱，证明真理在哪里。我们应当提醒他们说，就是这一些人当时用一切可能的办法谴责我国，说我国是法西斯主义者，说我们是嗜血成性的人，说我们正在毁掉我国人民，说我国劳动人民不拥护我们，等等。今天他们又希望把波兰和匈牙利的事件的责任推到我们肩上，我们应当提醒他们，叫他们记住这一点。这种背信弃义的倾向起源于那些顽固的斯大林主义分子，他们在各国党内设法继续保持他们的职位，他们再一次希望巩固他们的统治，把这种斯大林主义的倾向强加在他们人民头上，甚至别国人民的头上。关于这一点，我以后还要谈到。现在我只希望告诉你们，我们必须根据整个发展情况来看匈牙利事件。
    问题不仅仅是个人崇拜  问题是使得个人崇拜得以产生的制度
    由于苏联的希望和倡议，我们同苏联恢复了正常关系。斯大林死后，苏联的新领导人看到，由于斯大林的愚蠢，苏联处于一种非常困难的境地，处于一条死胡同里，不论是在外交政策和国内政策上都是如此，而且，由于斯大林的吹毛求疵和强迫采用他的方法，在其他人民民主国家里也是如此。他们了解到所有这一切困难的主要原因在什么地方，他们在第二十次代表大会上谴责了斯大林的行动和他的直到那时的政策，但是他们错误地把整个事情当作一个个人崇拜问题，而不是当作一个制度问题。而个人崇拜，实际上，是一种制度的产物。他们没有同这个制度进行斗争，或者，就是说他们进行了斗争，也是在暗地里这样做的，而口头上却说，总的来说，一切都很好，只是到了最近，由于斯大林老了，他开始有点愚蠢起来，犯了各种错误。
    我们从一开始就说，这里不仅仅是一个个人崇拜问题，而是一种使得个人崇拜得以产生的制度问题，根源就在这里，这就是需要不断地坚持地根除的东西，而这也是最难以作到的事。这些根源在哪里呢？在于官僚主义组织机构，在于领导方法和所谓一长制，在于忽视劳动群众的作用和愿望，在于各种各样的恩维尔·霍查之流、谢胡之流以及有些西方和东方国家的党的其他领导人，他们抗拒民主化和第二十次代表大会的决议，而且他们对斯大林制度的巩固出了不少的力，他们今天正在努力恢复这个制度，使它继续占上风。根源就在这里，这就是需要纠正的。
    除了南斯拉夫和苏联之外  莫斯科宣言是供更多国家应用的
    就我们而论，我们在同苏联的关系方面已经作了很大的努力。我们已经改善了关系，缔结了一整套的经济协议，这些协议对我们很有益，是根据非常有利的条件，等等。同时还通过了两项宣言，一项是在贝尔格莱德通过的，一项是在莫斯科通过的。这两项宣言不仅对我们两国相互关系，而且对所有社会主义国家的关系，都应该有实际的意义。但是，遗憾的是，这两项宣言没有这样被人所理解。有人认为：好吧，既然南斯拉夫人这样坚决，我们就尊重和执行这两项宣言，不过，这两项宣言与别国无关。因为在那里，情况到底和南斯拉夫有点不同。南斯拉夫是一个有组织有纪律的国家。南斯拉夫人已经表明他们是当之无愧的，甚至在最困难的时刻里，他们也坚持不屈，没有让资本主义制度复辟，等等。这也就是说，他们跟你们东方国家的人不同，在你们那里，是我们使你们当权的。而这就错了。因为，那些在1948年引起南斯拉夫进行反抗的分子，在这些东方国家里，在波兰，在匈牙利，甚至在别的地方，也是存在的，有些地方多一些，有些地方少一些。当我们在莫斯科起草关于我们党的关系——主要是关于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和苏联共产党之间的关系——的宣言的时候，这遇到了一点困难。在这一点上，我们不能完全同意，但是即使如此，还是通过了一项宣言，在我们看来，这项宣言是供除了南斯拉夫和苏联之外更大的范围应用的。我们当初一直提醒说，那些在以前曾经在南斯拉夫引起这样有力抵抗的倾向，在所有国家都是存在的，有一天也会在其他国家中表现出来，到了那时就更加难以纠正了。
    你们知道，赫鲁晓夫曾经到这里来休息。那一次我们在这里举行了会谈，在贝尔格莱德又举行了更详尽的会谈。由于我、兰科维奇同志和普察尔同志被邀前往克里米亚，我们就去了，并且继续进行会谈。我们看到，对于其他国家，这件事会遇到一些困难，因为苏联的领导人对于其他国家抱有不同的态度，因为他们对于同这些国家、同波兰、匈牙利等的关系有过一些错误的和有缺点的看法。不过，我们对于这一点并不看得很悲观，因为我们看到，这不是整个苏联领导方面的态度，而是一部分人的态度，这一部分人在某种程度上强使另一部分人接受这种态度。我们看到，这种态度是那些过去一般来说是站在斯大林主义的立场上而且现在仍旧站在这种立场上的人们所强加于人的，但是，尽管如此，那些主张在民主化方面有更加有力和迅速发展，主张放弃一切斯大林主义方法、在社会主义国家之间建立新的关系，而且这方面的发展也应该在外交政策上发生的分子，仍然有可能通过内部的演变而在苏联领导机构内部取得胜利。我们从某些迹象上，从会谈中看出，这些分子并不弱，他们是强大的，但是这种朝着进步方向，朝着放弃斯大林主义方法方向发生的内部发展过程却受到了阻挠，而且也受到某些西方国家的阻挠，它们由于它们的宣传和不断重复有必要“解放”这些国家而在干涉这些国家的内政和妨碍这些国家之间的关系的迅速发展和改善。因为苏联认为，由于这种对内政的干涉已经在电台宣传，用气球运送物品等等方面达到了相当大的规模，如果他们完全对这些国家放手不管，而且让它们——比如说——得到像南斯拉夫那样的地位，那就会产生不愉快的结果。他们担心，在这些国家里，那时反动派势力可能得胜。换句话说，这意味着，他们对于这些国家的内部革命力量没有足够的信任。我认为，这是错误的，所有后来这一切错误的根源就在于对这些国家人民的社会主义力量没有足够的信任。
    我国的活动一直很积极有益
    当事情发展到你们大家都熟悉的波兹南事件的时候，苏联人中间对我们的态度发生了一种突然的转变。他们开始冷淡起来了。他们认为，发生这一事件得责怪我们南斯拉夫人。是的，我们是该受责怪的，因为我们生活在这世界上，因为我们有这样的现状，因为我们建立一个目前这样的南斯拉夫，因为它的活动的影响达到了我国境外。即使我们并不希望这样，我们的国家仍然会是活动的，而且活动得非常积极和有益。尽管有过各式各样的迫害，并且采取了斯大林主义的摧残干部的方法，但是波兰仍然留下一个以哥穆尔卡为首的领导人核心，他们在第八次全体会议上，有力地掌握了局面，果敢地采取了自己的新道路——就是争取民主化、争取他们完全独立但也争取对苏联的良好关系，坚决地抵抗对他们内政的干涉，由于波兰这一情况，必然存在的反动势力才没有公然抬头，而这种势力是一直希望在共产党人发生冲突时抬头的。由于苏联领袖们的成熟的考虑和态度——他们在适当的时刻停止了干涉——波兰的情况现在已大大地稳定下来了，而且有了相当好的发展。
    我不能说，波兰的这种与我们非常相似的积极发展，在“社会主义阵营”的其他国家中受到了何种欢迎，相反，它受到了批评，不过是在私下、在他们中间受到批评，但是在某种程度上也公开受到批评。在这些国家中，波兰甚至还没有得到它在已经同意了波兰的态度的苏联领导人那里得到的那么多的支持。在“社会主义阵营”某些国家的那些领导人物中间，甚至在西方的某些共产党中间，波兰并没有得到谅解，因为斯大林分子仍然在那里掌权。
    当那位自命的历史学教授在法国讲课，并且说，南斯拉夫是帝国主义的阴险的代理人，当法国共产党中的掌权人物在这样一个可悲的、困难的时候，在千千万万的人民前面提出这种严重的指责的时候，那末这是否会成为社会主义事业会在将来正确地发展的保证呢？不能。这些不负责任的堕落分子的过份行为，应由那个党的领导人来负责。或者，举例来说，如像恩维尔·霍查这样一位除了只知道在口头上说说“马克思列宁主义”就再讲不下去了的自命的马克思主义者，写了一篇关于南斯拉夫的文章，虽然没有提南斯拉夫的名字，但是打击的是南斯拉夫和波兰，在文章中他坚决地谴责了根据自己的具体条件选定道路和发展的倾向，甚至反对了赫鲁晓夫和其他苏联领导人已经承认了的东西——走向社会主义有各种具体的道路。这样一种方式不但敢于中伤和反对南斯拉夫和另一个伟大的社会主义国家，而且甚至打击了苏联领导人自己。这种斯大林主义分子认为，可以在苏联找到一种斯大林牌号的人物来支持他们，来帮助他们继续骑在他们的人民的头上。同志们，这种态度是致命的。
    当我们在莫斯科的时候，当然也曾谈到波兰、匈牙利和其他国家。我们说，拉科西政权和拉科西本人毫无资格来领导匈牙利这个国家，来促进内部团结；正相反，他们只能造成严重的后果。不幸，苏联同志不相信我们的话。他们说，拉科西是个老革命家，正直，如何如何。说他是老的——这没有问题——但是这不够。说他是正直的——就我所知道的，我可不能证实这一点，特别是在拉伊克审判和一切其他事情发生之后。对我来说，这些人是世界上最不正直的人。苏联同志们说，他是慎重的，说他会得到成功，并说他们不知道在那个国家里还有其他的他们可以信赖的人。正因为我们的政策，不论是国家政策和党的政策都反对干涉别国内政，而且为了不再同苏联同志发生冲突，我们并没有充分地同苏联领导人争论要把像拉科西和格罗这种班子铲除掉。
    格罗同拉科西丝毫没有两样
    当我去莫斯科的时候，人们十分奇怪我为什么不取道匈牙利。正是因为拉科西我才不愿意这样作的。我说，我不打算从匈牙利走，即使那样会使旅程缩短三倍我也不干。当那个国家里共产党队伍本身表现出越来越大的不满的时候，当他们要求叫拉科西下台的时候，苏联的同志认识到事情不能像这样继续下去了，他们同意撤换拉科西。然而，他们犯了一个错误：没有让格罗以及其他那些在人民心目中威信扫地的拉科西追随者也被撤换掉。他们提出了条件：只有保留格罗才能同意撤换拉科西。而这是一个错误，因为格罗同拉科西丝毫没有两样，他奉行同样的政策，他同拉科西一样负有罪责。
    同志们，你们看，我们能够怎样做呢？我们看出来事情不是按应有的方式进行的。当我们在克里米亚的时候，格罗“恰巧”也在那里，而我们“偶然地”碰到了他。我们同他进行了会谈。格罗谴责了以前的政策，说那是一种错误的政策，说他们曾经污蔑了南斯拉夫，总之，他把过失都承包下来了，并且要求建立良好的关系，答应以前的一切错误都要纠正，旧的政策再也不再采用。我们希望表明我们是不念旧恶的，我们不是心胸狭窄的，所以我们同意同格罗和准备到南斯拉夫来的匈牙利劳动人民党代表团举行会谈。我们希望同匈牙利劳动人民党建立关系，因为我们希望不使匈牙利的党孤立，这样可以比较容易发生影响，使这个国家国内有正确的发展。
    然而，事态已经发展得深远得多了——这是我们当初所没有料到的——，以致格罗到南斯拉夫来以及我们所发表的联合声明已经无济于事了。匈牙利人民绝对反对仍然当权的斯大林主义分子，他们要求撤换这些人和采取民主化的政策。当格罗率领的匈牙利代表团回国的时候，格罗发现他自己处在一种困难的局势当中，而他却现出了他以前的面貌。他把当时还只不过是在举行示威的几十万示威者称为“暴徒”，这样就几乎侮辱了全国人民。想一想他的愚昧到了什么程度、想一想他是怎样的一个领导者吧。在这样一个危急的时刻，当一切都在混乱中、当全国都在不满的时候，他竟敢用“暴徒”这个字眼来污蔑人民，而这些人民当中有很大一个数目，甚至也许是大多数，是共产党人和青年。这就足以点燃火药桶、引起爆发了。于是，冲突跟着就发生了。请外国军队来教训自己的人民是一个严重的错误现在去调查谁放的第一枪是没有意义的。军队是由格罗请来的。在示威还在进行的时候把苏军请来，这是一个致命的错误。请别国的军队来教训自己国家的人民，这是一个严重的错误。这个举动结果更进一步激怒了人民，因此发生了自发的暴动，在这个暴动中，共产党人发现他们自己，事与愿违地同各种反动分子站在一起了。反动分子混在这次暴动之中，利用它来达到他们自己的目的。难道那里面没有很多霍尔蒂分子吗？谁改造了他们呢？难道能够期望拉科西改造他们吗？我们大家都知道，霍尔蒂在匈牙利有强大的法西斯势力，有“卍”组织，各种各样的其他反动分子，费伦茨·纳吉的信徒们等等。总之，有很大数量的人不赞成共产主义，他们不仅反对拉科西，而且反对整个的社会主义。所有这些人都混进这次暴动里来。以前，尽管国外要他们进行暴动，尽管他们从国外得到援助，这些反动势力是不敢抬头的，而且只要他们觉得党团结得和磐石一样，他们也就没有造反的力量和勇气。但是他们一看到党分裂了，很大一部分党员起来反对拉科西集团和过去的残余了，他们就立刻插足进来了。
    这些反动势力在两三天内很快地暴露了它们的真面目。由于在全体人民反对过去的一切作法的暴动中，当权的领导没有表示愿意消除那些激怒匈牙利人民的因素，从而开始沿着考虑到匈牙利一切内部具体方面的真正的在匈牙利发展社会主义的道路前进，事情很快地发生了不同的变化，反动分子开始日益得势。这个反对一个集团的正当的反叛和起义变成了一个反对社会主义和反对苏联的全国性暴动。等到反革命分子把局势掌握在他们的手里，参加这次反叛队伍的共产党人终于无可奈何地发觉他们参加的斗争不是为了社会主义而是为了恢复旧制度。他们发觉他们事与愿违地处在这样的一种境地之中了。
    现在是否可能阻止这种情况呢？看来似乎已经迟了。如果纳吉政府比较有魄力，如果它不是摇摇摆摆，如果它坚决起来反对无政府状态，阻止反动分子屠杀共产党人，如果它对于反动分子进行了坚决的抵抗的话……也许情况本来会向一种正确的方向发展，也许不会有苏联军队的干涉的。而纳吉作了什么呢？他号召人民拿起武器来抵抗苏联军队，并且呼吁西方国家进行干涉。
    在西方，苏联的干涉被充分地利用了。迫不及待地要进攻埃及的帝国主义者利用了这种干涉。他们正是在匈牙利悲剧的这个阶段进攻埃及的，他们进攻埃及，是希望苏联很难分身，因而不能干涉这个侵略。于是在匈牙利战斗又起。苏军得到了增援。纳吉逃跑了，同时一个新政府建立了。同志们，我可以对你们说，我知道这个新政府的人员，并且据我看来，他们代表的是匈牙利最正直的人。他们在拉科西时代受过迫害，他们坐过牢，并且真诚拥护有新的发展。你们已经读过的卡达尔宣布的纲领本身证明了这一点。可是苏联的干涉削弱了整个纲领，因此这个政府的处境非常困难。
    关于苏联在匈牙利的干涉
    现在可能有人问，苏联的干涉是否有必要？第一次干涉是不必要的。应格罗的请求而进行的第一次干涉是绝对错误的。第二次错误在于：负责人士竟等待第二次干涉，而没有立即采取他们后来在苏联进行第二次干涉的时候所采取的行动——那就是，他们应该成立一个新政府并且发表一项宣言。如果他们起初建立了一个新政府、发表了这样的一项宣言的话，工人和共产党人原会从反动分子当中脱离出来，从而会比较容易地找到一种摆脱这种严重局势的道路的。
    在我谈到苏军的第二次干涉以前，我必须说，匈牙利境内的局势已经达到了这样的规模——你们对于这一局势已经看到了很多的消息——以致于那里显然会有一场可怕的屠杀，一场可怕的内战，而在这种屠杀和内战中，社会主义会被彻底埋葬，第三次世界大战会因而爆发。因为，那种来自西方的干涉和霍尔蒂分子以及前反动分子的重新当权，是苏联政府所不能容忍的。
    这些反动分子做了些什么呢？我刚才已经说过，他们在很早的时候，就已经露出了真面目。事情已经很明显，他们越来越多地在上层占据了统治地位，并且开始禁止使用“同志”这个词和要求摘掉红星。当一个共产党员不能说出自己是一个共产党员，否则就要被弄死的时候，这一点是很明显的了，而且共产党员被活活吊死这个事实也使得这一点很明显了。假如说这种事件只发生过一次，假如说他们所吊死的某一个警察人员是一个出名的做坏事的人，那末也许可以说这种事件之所以发生，是一群人自发的反抗的结果。但是，发生的是一次普遍的屠杀。在索普伦，他们吊死了二十个共产党员。他们在大街上公开捉人杀人，如果这些人是穿黄色皮鞋的话，因为警察是穿黄色皮鞋的。他们破门入户杀害共产党员。所有这一切都是野蛮的法西斯反动暴徒们做出来的勾当。
    纳吉政府并没有做什么事来防止这种行为。它继续在电台上哭哭啼啼呼救，而没有对这种行为展开斗争，用某种方式表示要制止屠杀共产党员和进步人士的决心。它没有那样做，却发表一篇宣言，它在这一文告中退出了华沙条约，宣布自己的独立等等。就好像这是当时最重要的事情似的，就好像它的退出华沙条约是有意义似的。
    许多人现在提出了这样一个问题：为什么会发生苏军的第二次干涉事件？很明显，我们已经说过而且将要继续那样说：我们反对干涉，反对使用外国的武装部队。可是现在哪一种的坏处比较少一些呢？是混乱、内战、反革命和一次新的世界大战呢，还是苏军的干涉（事实上是发生了）？如果是前者的话，那会是一次大灾难；如果是后者的话，那会是一种错误。当然，假如那样做意味着可以挽救匈牙利的社会主义，那末，同志们，虽然我们反对干涉，我们可以说，苏军的干涉是必要的。但是，假如他们该做的事情早一些做了，那末就不会有军事干涉的必要的。这一错误不幸是由于他们认为军事力量可以解决一切问题的想法而产生的。而事实上军事力量却并没有解决一切问题。看吧，赤手空拳、武装很差的人民当他们抱定一个宗旨——争取自己的解放和独立——的时候，会作出怎样猛烈的反抗。他们已经不再在乎自己所要争取得到的是哪一种独立，对于是否会恢复一个资产阶级的反动制度也不再在乎了，他们所在乎的只是应该保持民族独立。在人民中间占优势的就是这种想法。当然，我现在只能这样说，第一件事是能够发生的事件中最糟糕不过的事，而第二件事——苏军的干涉——也同样是不好的；但是，如果它能使社会主义在匈牙利得以保全，也就是说能够在那个国家里进一步建设社会主义，能够导致世界的和平，那末终有一天这将成为一件好事情，但是条件是：一旦那个国家的情况稳定和平静下来以后，苏联军队立即撤出去。
    我们已经把这一点向苏联同志们说过。我们没有隐瞒什么东西。苏联同志们说，他们的军队那时是要撤退的。应该记住：苏联现在也是处在一个困难的境地。他们的眼睛现在已经打开了；他们发觉进行作战的不仅是霍尔蒂分子，而且还有工矿企业中的工人；他们发觉整个民族都在战斗。苏联的士兵们到那里去是不会有愉快心情的。悲剧也就在这里。
    在我报告完了以后，你们可以提出问题，因为我或许没有把每件事情都说得很清楚。但是你们可以放心：我们从来没有劝告他们使用军队。我们从来没有作过这样的劝告，即使现在他们处于危机的时候，我们也不会那样做。在这一严重的局面下，我们只能告诉他们，应该注意纠正过去的错误。这就是问题的中心。因此，对于我国国内流传的那些认为苏军的干涉纯粹是一种干涉主义者的行动的谣言，我们必须加以扑灭。这种说法是不正确的。同志们，我对这一点是深信不疑的。
    我完全相信，匈牙利境内所流的血和匈牙利人民所作的可怕牺牲，将要产生积极的影响，而苏联的同志们，甚至那些斯大林分子们，会理解和认识到，事情是不能再那样地做下去了。我们所痛心的——我们大家所痛心的——是：社会主义遭到了这么可怕的打击。它受到了损害。而你们，同志们，是否还记得，我们常常说过，这种方法只会损害社会主义？我们确实说过这些话。我现在并不要大家拍拍胸膛，兴高采烈地说：“我们早就这样告诉过你们了。”
    匈牙利的事件可能将是最后的一次悲剧
    关于这一悲剧，我有一句话要说：假如那些依靠斯大林主义方法而仍旧在各国共产党中当权的那些不负责任的分子劝苏联根据他们的想法办事的话，实际上是对苏联的一种很不好的支持。我认为，在这一切党内，一定有比这许多斯大林分子看得更远的正直的共产党人。他们确实要看得更远些。而如果他们要想改善那里的情况，并不用匈牙利方式，而是用一种和平的共产主义的方式去改善情况，那末他们就应该批评消极的东西，倾听群众的呼声，党员的呼声，以及全国人民的呼声。因为，如果这些预言家和谋士们继续以破坏的方式进行活动的话，如果他们认为有必要一味诽谤我国，继续污辱我们的话，那末，社会主义当然会要碰到更困难的时刻。南斯拉夫脚跟站得很稳，它到目前为止已经经过了多次的打击，因此来自国外的这些诽谤是不会使它离开自己的道路的。虽然我们还不能完全满意于我们的国内发展情况，但是我们将努力使我国人民尽量得到满足，不管我们现在和将来怎么样，我们一定要加倍努力，使这种预言家和谋士们无法实现他们那种目的在于制止南斯拉夫在1948年所开始的而目前正在波兰继续着的过程的企图，我们也一定不让他们把这种过程引导到斯大林主义的轨道上去。
    有一次我对苏联同志说，即使斯大林没有死，这也是会发生的，如果他活着的话，这甚至会发生得更迅速些。他们并不否认这一点。我们无权告诉他们应该这样做或那样做，我们只能指出他们的这种或那种行动可能引起的错误的与消极的结果。我相信，匈牙利事件可能是最后一次的悲剧，促使苏联同志们以及仍旧看不见这一点的其他各国的领导人，尽一切力量来避免在其他国家中发生与目前匈牙利情况相同的那种局势。
    在东欧的某些国家里和党内，有些领导人在说，这种事是不可能在他们的国土里发生的，他们说他们有一个强大的组织，一支强大的军队，一支强大的警察部队；他们说他们的全体党员已经知道了一切情况；他们说他们能够控制整个局势。这一点格罗也说过；这一点拉科西也说过。但是这对他们有什么帮助呢？如果他们不改变他们的工作方法，如果人民一旦起来反抗的话，那是一点也不会有什么帮助的。他们1948年以来所播下的种子，现在得到了收获了。他们当初播下微风，而现在却收获到暴风了！（长久的鼓掌）
    我们的发展前景和当前的任务
    匈牙利的这些事件使我国也存在的各式各样的人和分子受到一些鼓舞。他们为数不多，但是却大放厥辞。他们有些人一味梦想发生混乱，以便从中渔利。我从来没有说，我们已经完全消灭和改造了所有乌斯塔许分子、契特尼克分子和那些顽固的梵蒂冈的支持者们。我始终说，只有人民团结一致，才能防止他们在我国作任何尝试或取得任何成功。今天，人民和党的团结比过去任何时候都更必要，但是，这并不是因为我们害怕在我国可能发生什么事情，因为南斯拉夫毕竟是不同于匈牙利或任何其他国家的。我们通过我们自己的流血、通过解放斗争，进行了我们的革命，我们在革命期间已经彻底扫清了我们的内部。我们是不存在这种危险的。
    我决不会说，我们的人民完全满足了，我国的一切事情都是合乎要求的。而且连我自己也不满意。但是，南斯拉夫的情况是十分不同的——我国国内是存在着前景的，而且南斯拉夫的劳动人民正在不断地创造更远的前景。此外还有什么使我感到不满意的事呢？同志们，你们会记得，我去年作过一个报告，我在那个报告中指出必须改变我们的投资政策的方针。我深信，管理我们的经济的人们会记住这一点，而且我们应当认真地首先关心我国人民的生活水平。在这方面，已经有了某种转变，市场已经有了一定程度的稳定，物价的飞涨——这种飞涨可能引起通货膨胀——已经制止下来，但是并不是我所期望的一切都做到了。我们现在再次决定要更加大力地抑制一味搞建设的倾向。我们现在必须努力改善生活水平，同时还加强我国的国防。这两者都是最重要的，我们一定要注意它们。在这方面，我要说的就是这些。
    现在我愿意谈谈各种分子——我国存在的各种分子。他们的想法是这样的：“现在匈牙利发生了骚乱，霍尔蒂分子以及梵蒂冈分子和其他分子将会在那里取得政权，这是我们的一个机会。”照他们看来，南斯拉夫将再度被孤立和包围，他们将能在南斯拉夫比较顺利地进行活动。现在仍然有这种分子，但是我要说，他们是大错而特错了。因为，我们的党内并没有八十万党员——格罗说，他们的党有八十万党员，我听到这句话以后我看了他一下，感到有点怀疑——但是我们有大约六十多万党员，他们是曾在革命和斗争中受过考验的干部，他们不是带着各种追求地位的和其他的倾向参加我们党的，他们的肩上都负着建设我们国家的重任。他们会始终知道怎样及时阻止可能要破坏我们国家的任何人。在我们的国家里有着拥有六十多万盟员的共产主义者联盟，和拥有七百万盟员的劳动人民社会主义联盟。
    这七百万人都是自觉的社会主义建设者。他们有自己的纲领，而且知道他们的目的是什么。这七百万人随时可以发表他们的意见，如果他们认为不能再这样继续下去，如果他们认为我们不能再把这样庞大的款项投入基本建设方面，或者如果他们认为这件事或那件事是必要的。当然，不管是我或者我们的全体领导人员，无论谁也无权反对我国各族人民的这种愿望，即：应当用在今天可能达到的速度来建设我们的国家。同志们，你们知道，当你们每天碰到这些问题的时候，当你们看到这个或那个工厂要是建成的话明天就会产生足以立即改善局势的结果的时候，当你们又看到要保证大量增加生产只需再增加数以百万计的投资的时候，当你们仅仅看到这一点的时候，那些其他东西——我们的人——就有点受到忽视了。你们仅仅看到工厂而没有看到人。
    显然，我们仍然处在困难的境地。我们的对外贸易中有很大的逆差，这种逆差现在仍然不断增加，尽管在过去一年半期间中，我们缔结了一些相当有利的协定、主要是同苏联缔结的以非常有利的条件、即以2％的利息取得的大宗贷款的协定。其次，我们已经缔结了关于德国赔偿支付办法的协定。捷克斯洛伐克已经勾销了——这就是说抵去了一亿美元，同时和匈牙利之间的债务将要根据它的可能来解决。由于缔结了这一些协定，我们已经改善了建设方面的状况。最后，我们已经用信贷的办法从美国得到总值约为一亿美元的小麦和某些原料。我们的状况并不像某些人希望把它说成的那样困难。粮食和面包将不愁缺乏。在我国，市场有些紊乱，因为这些人太不注意设法让市场有充分的供应了。虽然在这方面全国存在着非常有利的条件。以贝尔格莱德为例，这个城市附近有潘切瓦奇基·里特农场，那里有极适合种植蔬菜的条件。有许多县和其他一些公社（南斯拉夫最低行政单位——译者注）可以为市场生产大量消费品，但是它们却并没有生产这些东西。例如，今天正在从卢布尔雅那运蔬菜到科巴尔去。这是一种什么政策啊，因为我们知道，科巴尔以前是供应的里雅斯特蔬菜的。在我们的国家内存在着一些这类不好的现象。我们必须帮助今天的卡达尔政府
    同志们，我稍稍离开了我向你们谈的问题。我希望告诉你们，从将来是社会主义还是反革命这样的角度来看匈牙利目前的发展，我们必须保卫卡达尔的现政府，我们必须帮助它。我们应该帮助它，是因为它处于非常困难的境地。我们必须反对所有那些现在正在不负责任地把全部过错都归咎于俄国人的分子。是的，苏联同志们没有在事先发现和纠正拉科西政权的错误，没有让那些得到工人阶级和全体人民的信任的人们能够执政，他们应当对这些情况负责。因为谁也不能强把一个领袖加于一个民族——那是办不到的。
    在波兰，情况已经开始稳定了，但是并不是十分巩固的。同样的分子也在那里活动，这些分子是反对波兰同苏联有良好关系的。你们知道，那些有着反动观念的波兰人是憎恨俄国人和苏联的。必须使波兰人民摆脱既憎恨苏联而又憎恨社会主义本身的这种反动势力。因为波兰的工人阶级和共产党人有着远大的眼光，知道他们可以从苏联得到什么支持。例如，如果没有苏联的支持，波兰人就很难保卫奥得—尼斯河边界，而德国人是从来没有承认过这条边界的，他们是会对这条边界再提出要求的。总之，在这方面所需要的是相互帮助和支持。
    同样，我们必须同波兰政府和党保持最密切的联系，尽我们的一切力量来帮助他们。我们必须同波兰同志们一起来反对其他各国的党——无论东方国家的或西方国家的——内出现的那种倾向。同志们，这个斗争将是困难的和长期的，因为实际牵涉到的问题是：新的趋向是否会在各国共产党内得胜——这种趋向实际上是在南斯拉夫开始的，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议曾经为这种趋向创造了相当多的因素。现在的问题是：是这条路线得胜呢，还是斯大林主义路线再度得胜。南斯拉夫不能只管自己，它必须在各方面努力，不过不是用从内部破坏这些国家而在那里引起消极的滥用权力的现象的办法，而是要在思想方面，通过联系和交谈，以求保证新的精神获得胜利。我们不应该不去批评这些党内不好的现象。你们已经读到了“战斗报”上那篇文章，在我看来，这篇文章作为第一篇文章是写得不坏的，但是它还不够，关于这个问题还需要再写文章。向我们盟员解释这个问题，是你们共产主义者和在人民中间工作的领导人的责任。我想你们是同意我的话的。（长时间鼓掌）
    关于对埃及的侵略
    现在让我简略地谈谈对埃及进行侵略的问题。你们已经读到关于我们在联合国所采取的态度的消息和我就这次侵略事件发表的声明，你们也读到了我们的报纸。但是我还是想谈谈过去的情况。当我在访问印度后的归程中第一次会见纳赛尔的时候，他向我谈到了他们在埃及的一切困难的确实情况。埃及是一个工业不发达的国家，生活水平非常低，并且没有任何强有力的内部组织——可以依靠的一个党。纳赛尔说，埃及的领袖们都是这样一些军人，他们把政权拿到自己的手中以便为他们的人民服务，为人民争取自由，保卫它的独立。当他陈述所有这些困难的时候，我们看来这些困难实际上几乎是难以克服的。后来，第二次，当我们访问埃及和开罗的时候，我们又进行了谈话，并且看到这些困难是艰巨的。但是我们注意到那个国家的人民已经开始觉醒，它已经开始有了民族觉悟。由于长期被占领和法英的殖民主义行动，这个国家的人民过去是受到压迫并且是处于冬眠状态的。我们认识到若是有和平，纳赛尔和他的人员在执行他们艰巨的任务的时候，是可以依靠人民的。
    在同纳赛尔谈话的时候，我曾经公开表示我恐怕难以相信帝国主义者会让他们有和平，同时认为他必须小心，不要给帝国主义者丝毫可能得到任何动机来干涉中东事务。当然，我不能够详细告诉他应当怎么做，而我只可能指出隐隐出现的危险。我告诉他，他应当知道帝国主义者是没有良心的人，他们现在还没有放弃他们的野心，他们认为埃及——它是世界这部分的最强大的国家——对于帝国主义者和殖民主义者在非洲和亚洲的属地来说是最危险的，埃及的强盛和发展可能促使帝国主义者和殖民国家阻止埃及为了发展它自己所作的努力。我们的看法（我在同纳赛尔举行的会谈中表示了这种看法）是，他们应当首先加强内部，他们应当建立一个内部政治组织，建立一支强大和坚定的军队，他们应当在经济方面来提高他们自己，争取获得他们可能获得的贷款，让人民马上看到新的政权是有一些作为的，可以感到有一定的改进。这就是我们提出的意见和建议，他们已经欣然接受。
    在第一次会谈中，纳赛尔就已经对我们说，他将不得不把苏伊士运河收归国有，因为埃及作为一个独立国家，是不能容忍外国来管理它自己的领土的。当然，他们有充分的权利把它收归国有，所要选择的只是适当的时机。当把苏伊士运河收归国有的时候，英法这两个大殖民国家反应很猛烈，当时有发动武装进攻来阻止国有化的威胁。但是由于联合国，这个第一个战争的威胁得以防止。当时决定进行谈判以便使得这个问题得到和平解决。尽管这样，他们还是进行了突然的侵略。埃及最先遭到以色列的进攻，后来遭到了英法两国的进攻。整个这次侵略大概是联合计划好的，发动进攻的时机选在令人遗憾的匈牙利事件发生的时候。他们对匈牙利的混乱表示欢迎，因为他们自己已经准备好了。英法两国利用以色列的侵略作为说明它们必须保护苏伊士运河的一个借口。
    以色列表明它是大国的一个工具
    这是同殖民国家过去发动的传统侵略没有任何区别的典型侵略。这完全是一样。在我看来，发动这次侵略的人今天已在后悔，因为他们的行动没有成功。第一，他们当初以为他们会在几天以内毁灭埃及，废黜纳赛尔；第二，他们以为这样一种心理状态在世界上占优势，那就是人们将不会出面干预，联合国将不会谴责他们，因为他们在这个组织中会得到多数票。但是他们的算盘打错了。情况恰好相反。埃及没有被毁灭，虽然它遭受到巨大的损失，它的军队打得很好，侵略者没有能够占领整个苏伊士运河，虽然他们仍然在进行战斗。埃及人民并没有像艾登所预料的那样废黜纳赛尔。在英国本身，工党对侵略和政府的政策采取了一种非常尖锐的态度。在联合国，绝大多数都谴责这种侵略行动，为埃及建立一支国际警察部队的工作现在正在进行，我们也表示愿意为这支部队提供我们自己的部队。这就是说，埃及人自己要求这样，所以我们大概也会派出我们的部队。
    这次以色列表明它是大国的一个工具，因此它构成了对和平的危险。不错，在阿拉伯人当中，存在着对以色列的强烈的反感，因为将近有一百五十万阿拉伯人被赶出世界这个地区，这些人现在是在极为困难的情况下生活着。埃及和其他阿拉伯国家不愿意缔结和约，也不愿意保证它们将把以色列作为一个国家看待，即它们不承认它。它们现在仍然拒绝承认它，但是这并没有给以色列发动侵略的权利。在任何情况下这都没有给它这种权利，虽然英国人和其他的人希望说成这样。阿拉伯人是否将承认以色列，这在很大的程度上取决于和平谈判和说服，取决于自从停战以来所产生的所有悬而未决的问题的解决。在我看来，最悲哀的是法国社会党人丢了脸，并且再度表明他们是那些企图不惜任何代价来保持旧的、传统形式的殖民主义的人们的忠实的仆从。他们的脸上将永远洗不清这个污点。他们希望通过对埃及的侵略不仅解决阿尔及利亚问题，而且在其他近东国家获得好处。他们以为这次冲突会蔓延到其他阿拉伯国家，他们从而可以加强他们的殖民地位。英国人以为，在占领苏伊士运河以后，他们将在近东有一个比较坚固的地位，在毁灭埃及以后，他们将能确保他们在中东的利益。这种侵略居然在法国议会得到大多数议员的支持，这是可悲的。只有共产党人和一小部分社会党人反对它。这是非常可悲的。
    同志们，这样就迫使我们要谨慎小心，因为，这已经表明所谓西方民主的维护者——法国和英国仅仅是在口头上主张和平、正义和民主，而实际上，他们是在机会到来的时候可能走向极端反动和侵略活动的温床。我确信，正是因为以居伊·摩勒为首的法国社会党人奉行的这种政策，不幸的法国人民总有一天会不得不付出昂贵的代价。
    我们希望帮助法国解决阿尔及利亚问题。我们对纳赛尔说，我们认为要法国人离开阿尔及利亚是困难的，而且最好还是用法国和阿尔及利亚之间建立联盟的办法来解决这个问题。当我们访问法国的时候，我们对法国领袖们也说了同样的话。“与其每天花十亿法郎来维持你们现在驻在阿尔及利亚的军队，倒不如把这笔钱的半数用来提高那些人的生活水平，用来修筑道路和建设其他工程，这样阿尔及利亚人民就没有什么可以反对你们的，他们就不会反对以和法国结成联盟这种形式来解决问题了。与其一天花十亿法郎，（那就是一个月花三百亿），你们倒不如走这条道路”。有些法国领袖认为这是正确的，可是另外一些领袖说，法国的威望那就成了问题。现在他们有威望了！他们已经在全世界面前丢了脸。全世界都谴责法国政府的行动，侵略的行动。
    南斯拉夫很活跃，在联合国中积极活动
    同志们，问题到现在还没有搞清楚，现在还没有搞清楚他们的目的何在，他们将做到什么程度，我怀疑，国际警察部队这个计划是否能顺利进行。英国人可能会这样希望：他们的一部分军队可以以警察身份留在埃及，但是，不论根据联合国章程还是因为他们是侵略者，这样做是不可能的。他们不能留在埃及。埃及决不会同意这样做的，任何正直的人都决不会同意这样做的。他们永远能找到借口来恢复他们的侵略行动。由于苏联政府更积极地过问这个问题，他们才有点慌了，开始小心起来。
    我们必须比以前更加要用我们的全部力量来维护世界和平。南斯拉夫很活跃，在联合国中积极地活动。在我们这方面来说，我们应当尽我们一切力量来维护世界和平。绝大多数人民是不希望发生战争的。如果说世界上有人珍视和平的话，我认为那就是我国的人民，他们热望和平，为的是能够在和平中来建设他们的美好的生活。在上一次战争中以及在前几次战争中，我们受够了苦难，我们流了够多的血，因此我们有理由要用我们的全部力量来为维护世界和平而斗争。但是，现在这个问题已经越出了我们一国的疆界。
    我们的国家是团结的、坚定的、磐石般一致的。现在的问题是改善我国人民的生活条件。我们的团结一致——这种磐石一般的性质和沉着，这种对世界上发生的即使是最严重的事件镇静对待而毫不慌张的态度，这种冷静的判断——对我们来说是很重要的。我们决不允许各种各样的可疑分子大放厥辞。下面的人民、群众应当制止他们发言，防止他们散布不和。
    如果你们还有什么不清楚的地方，我们愿意随时效劳，我们始终可以向你们解释这里所涉及的问题。显然，有的时候有些事情是不能谈的。你们不应当认为我今天把什么事情都谈了，因为我不能这样做。但是，有一件事我是可以告诉你们的，那就是我所没有告诉你们的事也是很重要的，而且在很大程度上是好的方面的。南斯拉夫今天在世界上起了一种受到重视的作用。为了使它能够继续起这种积极的作用，我认为我们必须继续执行我们一直到现在都在执行的始终如一的政策并且保持我们今天拥有的力量。
    同志们，这就是我所要告诉你们的。我已经简单地说明了基本轮廓和最重要的一些事情，我认为这在你们向我们的人民解释这些问题的时候对你们可能是有用的。
