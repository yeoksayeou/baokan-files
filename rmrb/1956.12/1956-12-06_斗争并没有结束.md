　　The Struggle Has Not Ended
    British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and French Foreign Minister Pineau simultaneously announced on December 3 that Britain and France had decided to withdraw their aggressor troops from Egypt. After a long period of delay and struggle, the British and French aggressors were finally forced to announce their withdrawal from Egypt, which is tantamount to declaring that their policy of armed aggression against Egypt had failed shamefully.
    The Anglo-French collusion with Israel to launch a war of aggression against Egypt was originally intended to seize Egypt's Suez Canal, overthrow the Nasser government, which pursued an independent and autonomous policy, and restore their colonial rule over Arab countries. However, the British and French aggressors have not only failed to obtain what they wanted, but have also put themselves in a very embarrassing and isolated situation. They have been met with resolute and forceful resistance from the Egyptian people and strong condemnation and opposition from the world, and their political and moral credibility has been swept away. Serious economic difficulties and political crises have arisen at home, and even a growing tendency towards division has occurred within the ruling group. Under these circumstances, the British and French aggressors, who repeatedly delayed and refused to withdraw their troops, finally had to get out of Egypt.
    The failure of the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt once again illustrates that an awakened nation, as long as it unites and resolutely fights against the aggressors, is invincible. The Egyptian people and army demonstrated a strong will to love independence and freedom, and a spirit of fighting against the enemy with one heart and one mind in the war against Anglo-French aggression. Their struggle is just, and they have received the sympathy and support of Arab countries and peace-loving countries and people all over the world. The forced withdrawal of the Anglo-French invading forces from Egypt is a victory for the sacred struggle of the Egyptian people, and also a victory for the world's forces of peace and the cause of justice.
    However, the fact that Britain and France were forced to announce their withdrawal from Egypt does not mean that they have abandoned their ambition to continue aggression against Egypt. Their withdrawal is not unconditional, and there are conspiracies hidden within it. When Lloyd and Pineau announced the decision to withdraw their troops, they did not specify the specific date for the withdrawal of the British and French invading forces from Egypt, and stubbornly linked the British and French withdrawal with the Suez Canal issue. Pineau even openly stated that the decision of Britain and France to withdraw from Egypt was made after the British and French governments were convinced that the United Nations forces would intervene in the Suez Canal issue. Britain and France want to use the United Nations forces to achieve the goals they did not achieve in the war of aggression against Egypt. In their letter to the United Nations on the same day, they even proposed to the United Nations to resolve the Suez Canal issue in accordance with the so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" of the London Conference, which had already been rejected by Egypt. There are also reports that the Secretary-General of the United Nations is negotiating with Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi, urging Egypt to agree that the United Nations forces should clear the canal before all the British and French invading forces leave Egypt; and that when the United Nations forces clear the canal, Britain and France can participate in the salvage work. It is very clear that Britain and France are attempting to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal through the United Nations forces and realize their plan to "internationalize" the Suez Canal.
      This conspiracy of Britain and France was planned together with the United States. Before Britain and France announced their withdrawal from Egypt, the United States promised to supply Britain and France with oil. After Britain and France announced their withdrawal, the United States immediately issued a statement calling on the United Nations and other relevant countries to immediately pay attention to the so-called "basic issues" in the Middle East, and threatened that the work of restoring the normal use of the Suez Canal could not be delayed for a day, otherwise it would be a violation of the 1888 treaty. At the same time, the United States emphasized that it wanted to "cooperate without restriction" with the United Nations and "fully support the measures that need to be taken to enable the United Nations forces to complete this task." The purpose of the United States is obviously to force Britain and France to withdraw from Egypt so that it can intervene in the Suez Canal issue and collude with Britain and France to use the United Nations forces to control the Suez Canal.
      The practice of the United States colluding with Britain and France in attempting to use the United Nations forces to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal completely violates the United Nations Charter and the United Nations' resolutions on the situation in Egypt. The Suez Canal issue and the withdrawal of the British and French aggressors from Egypt are two completely different matters and should not be confused. The solution to the Suez Canal issue should be based on the six principles adopted by the United Nations Security Council resolution on October 13 this year, and peaceful negotiations should be conducted by the countries concerned on the basis of guaranteeing Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal. The resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly condemning Britain, France, and Israel for launching a war of aggression against Egypt all call for the unconditional and immediate withdrawal of the British, French, and Israeli invading forces from Egyptian territory. The mission of the United Nations Emergency Force is only to monitor the ceasefire and supervise the withdrawal of the British, French, and Israeli invading forces, and it has no right to interfere in the Suez Canal issue at all. Britain and France have long delayed and refused to implement the United Nations resolutions requiring them to withdraw from Egypt; now they are colluding with the United States to attempt to use the United Nations forces to interfere in the Suez Canal issue, which is an infringement of Egypt's sovereignty and dignity and a blatant contempt for the principles of the United Nations Charter.
    This carefully designed conspiracy by Britain, France, and the United States is not only intended to use the United Nations forces to force Egypt to make concessions on the Suez Canal issue, but they also want to incite those countries related to the Suez Canal issue to exert pressure on Egypt. According to the plans of Britain, France, and the United States, if Egypt refuses the United Nations forces to intervene in the Suez Canal issue and refuses to carry out the work of clearing the canal before the British, French, and Israeli invading forces withdraw from Egypt, they will shift the responsibility for the Suez Canal not being able to resume navigation quickly to Egypt and cause dissatisfaction among other countries towards Egypt.
    In the past period of time, the United States has always said that its policy in the Middle East differs from that of Britain and France, and it has disguised itself as a "mediator." However, in no time at all, the United States has emphasized that it will adopt a joint policy with Britain and France in the Middle East. Facts have proved that the United States' eagerness to seize the Suez Canal and interfere in the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries is no different from that of Britain and France.
    Now, although the British and French aggressors have been forced to announce their withdrawal from Egypt, the struggle of the Egyptian people and the people of the Middle East has not ended. Due to the intervention of the United States, this struggle will become more complex. The recent creation of new tensions in Syria by the United States, Britain, and France in an attempt to subvert the Syrian government fully exposes their aggressive ambitions. Therefore, all countries and people who are willing to see the independence and sovereignty of Egypt and Arab countries not being harmed and are willing to uphold international justice still need to be a hundred times more vigilant and continue to support Egypt and Arab countries' just struggle against aggression and to defend national independence and sovereignty.

　　斗争并没有结束
    英国外交大臣劳埃德和法国外长比诺12月3日同时宣布，英法决定从埃及撤退它们的侵略军。英法侵略者经过长时间的拖延和挣扎，终于被迫宣布从埃及撤军，这就等于宣布它们的武装侵略埃及的政策已经可耻地失败了。
    英法勾结以色列发动对埃及的侵略战争，本来是想要夺取埃及的苏伊士运河，推翻奉行独立自主政策的纳赛尔政府，恢复它们对阿拉伯国家的殖民统治。但是，英法侵略者现在不但没有能够得到它们想要得到的东西，而且使它们自己陷入了十分狼狈和十分孤立的境地。它们遭到了埃及举国人民坚决和有力的抵抗，遭到了全世界强烈的谴责和反对，在政治上和道义上信誉扫地。国内引起了严重的经济困难和政治危机，甚至在统治集团内部也发生了日益明显的分裂倾向。在这种情况下，一再拖延和拒不撤军的英法侵略者，终于不得不从埃及滚出去。
    英法侵略埃及战争的失败，再一次说明：一个觉醒了的民族，只要团结起来坚决同侵略者进行斗争，它是不可被战胜的。埃及人民和军队在反抗英法侵略的战争中，表现了热爱独立和自由的坚强意志，和同仇敌忾的战斗精神。他们的斗争是正义的，他们得到了阿拉伯国家和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的同情和支持。英法侵略军队被迫撤出埃及，是埃及人民神圣斗争的胜利，也是世界和平力量和正义事业的胜利。
    但是，英法被迫宣布从埃及撤军，并不表示它们已经放弃对埃及继续进行侵略的野心。它们撤军并不是无条件的，这里面还包藏着阴谋。劳埃德和比诺在宣布撤军决定时，都没有说明从埃及撤退英法侵略军的具体日期，并且硬把英法撤军同苏伊士运河问题联系起来。比诺甚至公开声称，英法从埃及撤军的决定，是在英法政府确信联合国部队将干涉苏伊士运河问题之后作出的。英法想利用联合国部队来实现它们在侵略埃及战争中所没有达到的目的。在它们同一天给联合国的信中，竟然向联合国提出，要联合国按照那早已被埃及所拒绝的所谓伦敦会议“十八国提案”解决苏伊士运河问题。还有消息说，联合国秘书长正在同埃及外长法齐进行商谈，力促埃及同意在英法侵略军全部离开埃及以前，就由联合国部队来清除运河；而在联合国部队清除运河的时候，英法可以参加打捞工作。非常明白，英法企图通过联合国部队侵犯埃及对苏伊士运河的主权，实现它们的“国际共管”苏伊士运河的计划。
      英法的这个阴谋，是同美国一起策划出来的。在英法宣布从埃及撤军以前，美国就答应供给英法石油。英法宣布撤军以后，美国又立即发表声明，要联合国和其他有关国家立即注意中东的所谓“基本问题”，并威胁说，使苏伊士运河恢复正常使用的工作，一天也不能拖延，否则就是破坏了1888年条约。同时，美国强调它要同联合国“无限制的合作”，
  “充分支持为使联合国部队能够完成这个目的而需要采取的措施”。美
  国的目的显然是在迫使英法从埃及撤军之后，它好插手苏伊士运河问题，伙同英法利用联合国部队来控制苏伊士运河。
      美国串通英法企图利用联合国部队侵犯埃及的苏伊士运河主权的做法，根本违反了联合国宪章和联合国有关埃及局势的各项决议。苏伊士运河问题同英法侵略者从埃及撤军，完全是不同性质的两回事，绝对不能混淆起来。对苏伊士运河问题的解决，应该根据联合国安全理事会今年10月13日决议所通过的六项原则，在保证埃及对苏伊士运河主权的基础上，由有关国家进行和平谈判。而联合国大会谴责英法和以色列发动侵略埃及战争的各项决议，都是要英法和以色列侵略军队无条件地立即撤出埃及领土。联合国紧急部队的任务只是限于监督停火和监督英法和以色列侵略军队的撤退，它根本没有干涉苏伊士运河问题的权利。英法长期拖延和拒不执行联合国要它们从埃及撤军的决议；现在它们又同美国勾结一起，企图利用联合国部队来干涉苏伊士运河问题，这是对埃及主权和尊严的侵犯，是对联合国宪章的原则的公然藐视。
    英法和美国经过精心设计的这个阴谋，不但是想利用联合国部队来迫使埃及在苏伊士运河问题上让步，它们还想煽动起那些同苏伊士运河问题有关的国家对埃及施加压力。按照英法和美国的打算，埃及如果拒绝联合国部队干涉苏伊士运河问题，拒绝在英法和以色列侵略军队撤出埃及以前就进行清理运河的工作，它们就把苏伊士运河不能迅速通航的责任，推到埃及的身上，引起其他国家对埃及的不满。
    在过去一段时间里，美国总是口口声声说它对中东的政策同英法有分歧，把自己装扮成“调停者”的样子。然而，曾几何时，美国已在强调要同英法在中东采取联合政策了。事实证明，美国要夺取苏伊士运河和干涉阿拉伯国家独立主权的迫切心情，同英法是毫无二致的。
    现在英法侵略者虽然被迫宣布从埃及撤军了，但是埃及人民和中东人民的斗争并没有结束。由于美国的插手干涉，这个斗争将会变得更加复杂。美英法最近在叙利亚制造新的紧张局势，企图颠覆叙利亚政府，就充分暴露了它们的侵略野心。因此，一切愿意看到埃及和阿拉伯国家独立主权不受损害、愿意维护国际正义的国家和人们，仍需要百倍提高警惕，继续支持埃及和阿拉伯国家反抗侵略、保卫民族独立和主权的正义斗争。
