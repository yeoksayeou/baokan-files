Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 1st: Hatta resigned from his position as Vice President of Indonesia starting today.

The Speaker of the Indonesian Parliament, Sardjono, said after meeting with Hatta that there is no need to fill the vacancy for Vice President at present. This is because the Constitutional Assembly, which is tasked with drafting the national constitution, will decide whether it is necessary to maintain the position of Vice President. According to newspaper reports, Hatta mentioned difficulties in cooperation between him and President Sukarno in his resignation letter.

The Jakarta "People's Daily" believes that he is dissatisfied with the provisions of the "Interim Constitution" regarding the powers of the Vice President.

　　哈达辞去副总统职务
    据新华社雅加达1日电　哈达从今天起辞去了印度尼西亚副总统的职位。
    印度尼西亚国会议长沙多诺在同哈达会晤以后说，现在没有必要填补副总统的空缺。因为担负草拟国家宪法任务的制宪议会将决定是否有必要保持副总统的职位。据报纸报道，哈达在辞职书上提到了他和苏加诺总统之间的合作有困难。
    雅加达“人民日报”认为，他是不满意“临时宪法”对于副总统职权的规定。
