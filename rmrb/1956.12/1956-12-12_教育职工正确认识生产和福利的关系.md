Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 9th: The leaders of the Shanghai No. 2 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory recently explained to the employees through the Employee Representative Conference the actual situation of the gradual improvement of the factory's wage and welfare, enabling the employees to correctly understand the relationship between developing production and improving wages and welfare.

The factory leaders told the employees that after the wage reform this year, the average wage of all employees in the factory increased by more than 5 percent. In addition, the number of work shifts increased this year, and the average annual wage per person increased by more than 11 percent compared to last year. The state stipulates that welfare expenses account for 7.5% of the total wages. This year, the actual expenditure of the factory has exceeded 20% of the stipulated total. In the past, the cost of expensive medicines used by employees who were sick was borne by the workers themselves. This year, it was changed to be borne by the state, so the factory's medical expenses increased by more than 30,000 yuan. The number of employee family dormitories newly built by the factory after liberation has doubled compared to the original number, and construction is still continuing. This year, the total amount of production bonuses and living hardship subsidies paid to employees was more than 138,000 yuan, more than double the amount of last year. Among the new workers added to the factory this year, some are family members of the factory's employees, which also directly increased the income of these employee families.

The leaders also cited many facts to let the employees understand the many efforts made by the leadership and cadres to improve everyone's lives, explaining the reasons why some of the demands made by the employees cannot be met for the time being. For example, the improvement of living conditions and the employment of family members cannot be fully resolved at present. The leaders also made a realistic self-criticism to the masses regarding the shortcomings of some cadres in not caring enough about the lives of the employees.

These vivid and specific explanations have made the employees realize that the improvement of life can only be gradually carried out with the improvement of production, and many employees have taken the initiative to examine their past incorrect ideas. Some employees whose houses were damaged originally did not plan to repair them and wanted to apply for new housing, but now they have decided to repair them and live in them for a few more years. Many employees said that if the leaders had made these things clear to us earlier, we would not have made excessive demands.

Many industrial enterprises in Shanghai are now, like the Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, adopting various methods to educate employees in hard work and plain living, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily. The Party organizations of various districts in Shanghai are also publicizing the significance of changing ownership to the city's 400,000 newly joint venture enterprises, so that employees understand how to treat production and welfare with a sense of ownership.

    教育职工正确认识生产和福利的关系
    上海国棉二厂的领导人把几年来全厂职工生活改善了多少，目前有哪些福利事业办不到，都向职工讲清楚。职工说：如果领导上早点让我们明白这些，我们就不会提出过多过高的要求了。
    据新华社上海9日电　国营上海第二棉纺织厂的领导人员最近通过职工代表会议，向职工说明全厂工资福利逐步改善的实际情况，使职工正确地认识了发展生产和改善工资福利的关系。
    这个厂的领导人告诉职工，在今年工资改革以后，全厂职工的平均工资增加了百分之五点多，加上今年开工班次增加，每人每年平均工资比去年增加百分之十一点多。国家规定福利费占工资总额的7.5％，今年全厂实际支出已超过规定总数的20％。去年职工生病所用的贵重药品费用由工人自己负担，今年改由国家负担，全厂医药费支出因而多了三万多元。全厂解放后新建的职工家属宿舍比原来增加两倍，目前还在继续建造，今年支付的职工生产奖金和生活困难补助费共十三万八千多元，比去年增加一倍多。今年厂里增加的新工人中，一部分是本厂职工家属，也直接使这部分职工家庭增加了收入。
    领导人还引用很多事实让职工们了解领导方面和干部们为了改善大家生活所作的许多努力，说明职工们提出的某些要求，目前还暂时办不到的理由。例如居住条件的改善和家属就业问题，目前就不能全部解决。对于某些干部对职工生活关心不够的缺点，领导人员也向群众作了实事求是的检查。
    这些生动具体的情况说明，使职工们切实认识到生活的改善只能随着生产的提高来逐步进行，许多职工主动检查了过去的不正确想法。有的职工住房坏了，原来不准备再修，想申请新工房住，现在决定再修一修住几年。有不少职工说，如果领导上早点让我们明白这些，我们就不会提出过高过多的要求了。
    上海的许多工业企业现在都在像国棉二厂一样，采取多种多样的方式，向职工进行艰苦朴素、勤俭办企业的教育。中共上海市各区的党组织也正在向全市四十万新合营企业的职工宣传改变所有制的意义，使职工们明白如何以主人翁的态度对待生产和福利。
