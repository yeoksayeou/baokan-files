Heads-up crops have small ears
(Korean Proverb) Heads-down crops have big ears, heads-up crops have small ears. Spiders that don't spin webs can't catch bugs. A three-day journey forced into one day will require at least ten days of lying down to recover. An eagle's claws may be big, but it doesn't necessarily catch flies. The finer the rice flour is ground, the more refined the language becomes through usage.

    仰头的庄稼穗必小
    （朝鲜谚语）低头的庄稼穗必大，仰头的庄稼穗必小。不织网的蜘蛛捉不到虫。三天的路强做一天走，走完至少躺十天。老鹰爪子大，不一定捉住苍蝇。米粉越磨越细，语言越用越精。
