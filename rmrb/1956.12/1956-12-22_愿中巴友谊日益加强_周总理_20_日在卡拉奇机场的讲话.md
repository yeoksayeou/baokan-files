May Sino-Pakistani Friendship Grow Stronger
Premier Zhou's Speech at Karachi Airport on the 20th

Your Excellency Prime Minister Suhrawardy, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Thank you for your warm welcome. From such a warm welcome, we directly feel the friendly feelings of the Pakistani people towards the Chinese people. We also bring the Chinese people's friendship and goodwill towards the Pakistani people. I would like to express our warm congratulations and sincere respect to the Pakistani people on behalf of the Chinese people.

Both the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan are young countries. However, the friendly contacts between our two peoples can be traced back to many centuries ago. Because we have all suffered from colonialist aggression, this friendly relationship was once hindered. But since we each gained independence, our friendly relations have been restored and further developed on a new basis. In particular, Your Excellency Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to China in October this year played a positive role in promoting understanding and friendly relations between our two countries. As a result of that visit, we issued a joint statement expressing our common desire to safeguard world peace and promote friendship between all countries.

My visit is in return for Your Excellency Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to China. As your visit has once again demonstrated, direct contact between leaders of governments is always of great value. I am delighted to have the opportunity to learn about your country and your people. I hope that through a free and frank exchange of views between the leaders of our two countries on matters of common concern, the friendship between China and Pakistan will be further strengthened.

On my first arrival in your country, I sincerely hope that Pakistan will prosper and your people will be happy. May the friendship between China and Pakistan grow stronger and develop.

    愿中巴友谊日益加强
    周总理20日在卡拉奇机场的讲话尊敬的苏拉瓦底总理阁下，女士们和先生们，
    感谢你们对我们的热烈欢迎。从这样热烈的欢迎中，我们直接体会到巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的友好感情。我们也带来了中国人民对巴基斯坦人民的友谊和善意，我愿意代表中国人民向巴基斯坦人民表达我们的热烈的祝贺和诚挚的敬意。
    中华人民共和国和巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国都是年青的国家。但是，我们两国人民之间的友好接触可以追溯到许多世纪以前。由于我们大家都受到殖民主义的侵略，这种友好关系曾经受到阻碍。但是自从我们各自获得独立以来，我们之间的友好关系已经恢复，并且在新的基础上有了进一步的发展。特别是苏拉瓦底总理阁下今年10月在中国的访问，对于促进我们两国之间的谅解和友好关系起了积极的作用。由于那次访问的结果，我们发表了一篇联合声明，表达了我们两国为维护世界和平和促进各国之间的友谊的共同愿望。
    我这次的访问是酬答苏拉瓦底总理阁下对中国的访问。正如你的访问已经再一次证明了的，各国政府领导人之间的直接接触总是具有很大的价值的。我很高兴有机会来了解你们的国家和你们的人民。我希望，通过我们两个国家领导人员就共同有关的问题自由而坦率地交换意见，中国和巴基斯坦的友谊将会得到进一步的加强。
    我在第一次到达你们国家的时候，真诚地希望巴基斯坦繁荣和你们的人民幸福。愿中国和巴基斯坦的友谊日益加强和发展。
