Xinhua News Agency report: Shanghai's industrial and commercial departments are jointly taking measures to ease the tight supply of daily necessities during the peak season. According to estimates by the Shanghai Municipal Third Commercial Bureau, by the end of this year, the quantity of goods supplied to various regions by Shanghai's ten industrial products purchasing and supply stations may increase by more than 17% compared to last year. The supply volume of the medicine and transportation electrical equipment supply stations will even exceed last year's by 56% to 57%. The supply of cotton cloth, Shanghai's largest product, will increase by 179 million meters this year. This year's supply will reach 1.4 billion meters. The cloth distributed from Shanghai to the people of the whole country alone will average more than two meters per person. Other items such as rubber shoes, undershirts and pants, wool yarn, woolen fabrics, and cigarettes have also increased significantly compared to last year.

Since the market entered the peak season after autumn, an average of more than 4,000 tons of daily necessities have been shipped out of Shanghai every day, but various regions still feel unsatisfied. In order to meet consumer needs as much as possible, in addition to the state allocating large quantities of rubber, cotton yarn, tobacco leaves, and hardware materials to increase factory output, commercial departments have also sent large numbers of personnel to many regions across the country to purchase various waste and old raw materials to support industrial production. Many purchasing and supply stations have also sent people to help factories tap their potential to obtain additional increased production goods. As a result of the Shanghai purchasing and supply station of the China Textile Products Company sending three visiting groups to work with industrial departments, more than 5.7 million meters of printed and dyed cloth can be produced in November and December. Commercial departments have also adopted the method of extensively purchasing factory inventory, obtaining 1,200 tons of small-cut paper, 3,500 reams of hairpins, 1,710 dozens of mirrors, as well as a large amount of goods such as woolen fabrics and woolen sweaters. Due to the adoption of the above methods, the situation of tight supply has eased, except for a few commodities such as woolen fabrics.

According to the Shanghai Municipal Third Commercial Bureau, there is also a certain degree of artificial tension in this year's peak season supply of daily necessities. The requisition of goods by sales units in many areas lacks a basis and has great blindness. According to the knitwear supply station, the quantity of 25 kinds of goods requested by various regions for supplementary supply in November exceeded more than twice the total value of all goods purchased by this station in November. A department store wholesale station in Yunnan Province once requested 1 million sewing machine shuttles from the Shanghai Department Store Supply Station, which can assemble 1 million sewing machines, while Shanghai's supply of sewing machines to the whole country this year is only more than 100,000 units.

### 上海工业和商业部门采取积极措施  缓和日用品供应紧张的状况  供应各地的商品比去年增加了很多

    缓和日用品供应紧张的状况
    供应各地的商品比去年增加了很多
    新华社讯　上海工业和商业部门共同采取措施缓和旺季市场日用品供应紧张状况。据上海市第三商业局预计，到今年年底，上海十个工业品采购供应站供应各地商品的数量可以比去年增加17％以上。医药和交通电工器材两个供应站今年的供应额甚至要超过去年56％到57％。上海产量最大的棉布，今年供应量增加一亿七千九百万公尺。今年供应量可达十四亿公尺。仅从上海分配给全国人民的布，平均每人可得到两公尺多。其他如胶鞋、卫生衫裤、毛线、呢绒、卷烟都比去年增加了很多。
    从秋后市场进入旺季以来，平均每天从上海运出的日用品有四千多吨，但是各地仍然感到不满足。为了尽可能满足消费者需要，除国家拨出大批橡胶、棉纱、烟叶、五金材料来增加工厂产量外，商业部门还派出了大批人员到全国许多地区去收购各种废旧原材料来支援工业生产。许多采购供应站还派人帮助工厂发掘潜力，以获得额外的增产商品。中国纺织品公司上海采购供应站派出三个访问组和工业部门共同工作的结果，11、12两月内就可多生产印染布五百七十多万公尺。商业部门还采取广泛收购工厂存货的办法，获得一千二百吨小裁纸张、三千五百罗发夹、一千七百一十打镜子，以及呢绒、羊毛衫等大量商品。由于采用以上办法，目前除呢绒等少数商品外，供应紧张的情况已经缓和。
    据上海市第三商业局了解，今年旺季日用品供应工作中也有某种程度人为的紧张现象。不少地区的销售单位要货缺乏根据，有很大盲目性。据针棉织品供应站报告，11月份内各地要求补充供应二十五种商品的数量，竟超出这个站11月份所有商品进货总值的两倍多。云南省有一个百货批发站，曾向上海百货供应站要缝纫机梭子一百万只，可以装配一百万台缝纫机，而上海今年供应全国的缝纫机却只有十多万台。
