Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11th: The Third Construction Engineering Company of Central-South China has earnestly improved its leadership system and style, greatly changing the enterprise's outlook.

　　This engineering company was once one of the most backward construction enterprises in Wuhan. In July, it was ranked last in the labor competition among the eight construction enterprises in Wuhan. However, by the time of the re-evaluation on December 6th, it had jumped to first place.

　　In the first half of the year, this company only completed slightly more than 34% of the total contracted workload for the year, and the completion of other planned targets was also very poor. Particularly serious were the frequent quality and safety accidents, which wasted a lot of building materials and affected the enthusiasm of the workers. Starting in June, the company's Party committee systematically examined all aspects of work and found that the main reasons for the backwardness were the lack of a sound system of collective leadership and neglect of the mass line. Many major issues were not submitted to the Party committee for discussion, and there was a widespread tendency among Party committee members to "only care about what they are in charge of." When arranging and deploying work, leaders at all levels often unilaterally emphasized the legality of the state plan without seriously organizing mass discussions. Even when the masses or lower-level organizations raised opinions, they were indiscriminately labeled with hats of "conservative thinking" or "ignoring the state plan," regardless of whether their opinions were right or wrong. Difficulties arose because the work was not arranged reasonably, but instead of realistically mobilizing the masses to study and improve methods, they rigidly ordered the masses to complete the work, resulting in repeated phenomena of blindly rushing work and working overtime, causing accidents.

　　In response to the above situation, this company has vigorously strengthened the collective leadership system since July, determining that all major issues of the company must be submitted to the Party committee for discussion. At the same time, it criticized the tendency among Party committee members to "only care about what they are in charge of." The Party committee also frequently invited some cadres and engineering technicians to attend Party committee meetings. In July, at a meeting where the above-mentioned personnel were invited to attend, the Party committee mobilized everyone to criticize the leadership work of the Party committee and the company's organizations at all levels, and together with everyone, studied ways to improve the shortcomings. For example, regarding the issue of engineering quality accidents and safety accidents, after absorbing the suggestions of the masses, the Party committee led the entire company to carry out mass inspections, and decided that the administrative side should organize engineering technicians and office staff to educate workers on quality regulations and safety regulations by type of work. Party organizations at all levels, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations also strengthened political and ideological work around quality and safety issues. These measures gradually reduced quality and safety accidents.

　　Since July, leading cadres at all levels have begun to pay attention to promoting democracy; "going to the masses, going to the construction site" has gradually become a new trend. Staff members from the Party committee and mass organizations participate in the monthly planning meetings and production meetings, where everyone speaks freely and studies problems realistically. At the end of the second quarter and the end of the third quarter, the company also convened workers' representative meetings to listen to workers' criticisms and suggestions, and improve work based on mass opinions. Leading cadres of the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League are able to go to the construction site more frequently to understand the situation and solve problems. Some problems are relatively major and cannot be solved on the spot, so they are submitted to the Party committee for discussion before being resolved. The deputy secretary of the Party committee and the chairman of the trade union also went deep into the offices to help solve problems, so that the offices could face the construction sites and actively serve the construction sites.

　　Because of the above-mentioned work, major problems occurring in production can be solved in a timely manner, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers is unprecedentedly high, and the various aspects of the enterprise have been significantly improved. Since July, the entire company has over-fulfilled the state plan every month; quality and safety accidents have been greatly reduced; and the annual plan to reduce costs was completed ahead of schedule by the end of September.

### 健全集体领导　贯彻群众路线  竞赛落伍者跃居第一名

    健全集体领导　贯彻群众路线
    竞赛落伍者跃居第一名
    据新华社武汉11日电　中南第三建筑工程公司认真改进领导制度和作风，使企业面貌大大改观。
    这个工程公司曾经是武汉市最落后的建筑企业之一。7月间，在武汉市八个建筑企业的劳动竞赛评比中，曾被列为最末一名。但是，到12月6日再次评比的时候，它已经一跃而为第一名。
    上半年，这个公司只完成全年承包工作总量的34％强，其他各项计划指标也完成得很差。特别严重的是不断发生质量和安全事故，浪费了不少建筑材料，职工的积极性受到了影响。从6月份起，公司的党委系统地检查了各方面工作，发现造成落后的主要原因是没有健全的集体领导制度和忽视群众路线。许多重大问题没有提交党委讨论，党委成员间比较普遍地存在着“谁管什么就只关心什么”的偏向。各级领导在安排和部署工作的时候，往往片面强调国家计划的法律性，而不认真地组织群众讨论，甚至当群众或下级组织提出意见的时候，也不分是非地乱扣“保守思想”或“忽视国家计划”的帽子。工作由于安排不够合理而发生了困难，也往往不实事求是地发动群众研究改进的办法，而是硬性命令群众去完成，以致盲目抢工、加班加点的现象一再出现，造成事故。
    针对上述情况，这个公司从7月份起大力加强集体领导制度，确定全公司的重大问题必须提交党委讨论；同时对党委成员间“谁管什么就只关心什么”的偏向作了批判，党委还经常邀请部分干部和工程技术人员列席党委会议。7月份，党委就在一次邀请上述人员列席的会议上，发动大家对党委及公司各级组织的领导工作进行批评，并且和大家一起研究了改进缺点的办法。如关于工程质量事故和安全事故的问题，在吸取了群众建议以后，党委就领导全公司开展了群众性的检查，并且决定由行政方面组织工程技术人员和科室人员，分工种向职工进行了质量规程和安全规程的教育；党的各级组织、工会和青年团组织，也环绕质量和安全问题加强政治思想工作。这些措施使得质量和安全事故逐渐减少。
    7月份以来，各级领导人员开始注意发扬民主；“到群众中去，到施工现场去”，逐渐形成为一种新的风气。每月的计划会议和生产会议，都有党委和群众组织的工作人员参加，在会上大家畅所欲言，实事求是地研究问题。在第二季度末和第三季度末，公司还召开了职工代表大会，听取职工的批评和建议，根据群众意见改进工作。党委、行政、工会和青年团的领导人员，都能够比较经常地到施工现场去了解情况和解决问题。有些问题比较重大，不能就地解决，就提交党委讨论以后再解决。党委副书记和工会主席还深入科室帮助解决问题，使科室能够面向工地，主动地为工地服务。
    因为进行了上述工作，生产中发生的重大问题都能及时得到解决，广大职工劳动积极性空前高涨，企业各方面的状况都有了显著的改善。7月份以来，全公司每月都超额完成国家计划；质量和安全事故大为减少；降低成本的年度计划在9月底就提前超额完成了。
