The deep Friendship Between the Chinese and Cambodian People
　　Ding Min
　　Although it was early winter, the sun in Phnom Penh still felt warm on my head. It is said that the rainy season has just passed, and the weather will gradually cool down. However, on the day Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long arrived at Pochentong Airport (November 22), the weather was particularly hot at noon. From the airport to the Royal Palace in the city center, layer upon layer of welcoming crowds lined both sides of the road. Almost all the residents of Phnom Penh participated in this grand festival. The welcoming crowds from various places near Phnom Penh had already set off at dusk the day before. There were also people who had traveled from all over the country to join the welcoming party. All the welcomers were dressed in festive costumes, waving the national flags of China and Cambodia, cheering and singing.

　　The amiable Prince Sihanouk and royal family, government officials, the majestic guard of honor at the airport, the energetic Young Pioneer teams, the citizens and farmers lining the streets to welcome them, the colorfully dressed girls, the monks in yellow robes making the "Sampeah" gesture... Everyone was so enthusiastic. The slogans of "Long Live the Friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian People!" and the thunderous applause merged into one. Sitting in the car, I was deeply moved by the Cambodian people's friendship towards the Chinese people, with tears in my eyes.

　　During the few days in Phnom Penh, in front of the Royal Palace where Premier Zhou and Vice Premier He were staying, whether it was early morning or evening, or even after midnight, whenever a car came in or out, there were always countless crowds lining the streets and cheering. In Kampong Cham and Siem Reap, the streets along which Premier Zhou and Vice Premier He's cars passed were densely packed with cheering crowds. Most unforgettable was the journey from Phnom Penh by Royal Navy ship along the Mekong River tributary, the Sa River, to visit the important fishing town of Peam Chileang. For seventy kilometers, the national flags of China and Cambodia fluttered on both banks, and in some places, there were also colorful archways, and cheering crowds everywhere. Some people had traveled from thirty kilometers, or even seventy kilometers away, just to catch a glimpse of the Chinese guests on the ship.

　　On the ship, Prince Sihanouk said to Premier Zhou:
　　"Premier, all the Cambodian people want to see you and admire your demeanor. Although your visit to our country is very busy, we still retain this festival, so as not to let the residents along the Mekong River, the farmers and fishermen in the northwest say that we are biased towards the people of Phnom Penh, Kampong Cham, and Siem Reap."

　　From the smiles on the faces of the Cambodian people and their cheers, we not only felt the deep friendship between the Chinese and Cambodian people, but also the joy of a nation that had been oppressed by foreign races for hundreds of years in gaining independence, and their confidence in maintaining peace. They welcomed Premier Zhou so warmly because he was a representative of a great peace-loving neighboring country, one of the advocates of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and "an envoy of peace and friendship" (in the words of Prime Minister San Yun).

　　At a welcome banquet for Premier Zhou held at the Government Building in Phnom Penh, Cambodian youths performed a newly written one-act play with the theme of "Cambodia Adopts the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence." The plot, scenery, and makeup of this play were very simple, but it was deeply moving because it reflected the Cambodian people's belief in peaceful coexistence. At the beginning of the play, carpenters, sugar workers, rice pounders, and weavers were working. An older elementary school teacher invited them to the National Theater to see a play called "The Root of War." This play within a play was about several people standing on benches and fighting each other, and then all falling down, which represented the failure of the aggressors. Finally, a giant symbolizing peaceful coexistence appeared on the stage. People no longer quarreled but engaged in friendly economic cooperation and cultural exchanges. A scene of peace and prosperity appeared, and people's lives gradually became happier.

　　This desire of the Cambodian people is not a fantasy but a reality. From land, water, and air, we can see Cambodia's fertile land, rolling forests, beautiful mountains, and abundant products. The underground wealth is even immeasurable. The wise and hardworking Cambodian people today have a peaceful environment for economic development. The two-year construction plan formulated by Sihanouk is being implemented by the Royal Government. However, due to the exploitation and plunder by colonialists in the past, production has not developed, and there are still some difficulties in construction. Therefore, they cherish the cooperation and assistance they receive from friendly countries. During Premier Zhou's visit, banners with slogans in both Chinese and Cambodian saying "Thank you for China's assistance" could be seen everywhere. The newspapers praised it, and the Royal Government, from the Prime Minister to the ministers of various departments and local leaders, constantly mentioned it in their speeches and talks; although Premier Zhou Enlai repeatedly stated that our assistance was "insignificant." The Cambodian people particularly cherish the assistance from China, the Soviet Union, and other countries because this kind of assistance does not have any conditions attached and is a mutual help between brothers or friends.

　　During Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly visit to Cambodia, we visited the Yayavarman Museum, which displayed a dazzling array of ancient utensils; the great Silver Pagoda architecture, and the vivid murals nearby. These not only depict the daily life of the Cambodian people but also the trade relations and cultural exchanges between the ancient Cambodian people and neighboring countries, especially China. There are also many moving murals that show the heroic stories of the ancient Cambodian people resisting foreign aggression and driving the invaders out of their land. From the plane, we also saw the huge irrigation canals built by Cambodia's ancestors, and the ruins of the ancient capital of the kingdom from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries. In the ancient temples and stone pagoda buildings of Angkor Wat, Bayon Temple, Angkor Thom, etc., built in the twelfth century, there are many stone carvings, reliefs, and Buddha statues, which are rare and precious works of art. They not only represent the high culture of the ancient Cambodian people but also are a valuable cultural heritage of mankind.

　　We also enjoyed the classical dance directed by the Queen herself, the poetic lyrical short plays, the story of the ancient Indian myth of Palasen, the folk dances often performed during the New Year and religious festivals, the Maha Leegu music of the Norodom dynasty, as well as the beautiful modern folk dances and melodious music of Cambodia. We also saw the lively scenes of the dragon boat race held annually during the Water Festival, according to ancient folk traditions.

　　In Phnom Penh, we visited some modern cultural and educational institutions representing Cambodia, such as museums, art schools, medical colleges, and craft schools, which made us deeply realize that the Cambodian people, on the one hand, preserved their inherent excellent culture, and at the same time, are working hard to learn modern culture to improve the people's cultural level and are willing to restore and develop cultural exchanges with the people of all countries in the world, especially the Chinese people, and advance together.

　　When Premier Zhou Enlai was about to leave, Prince Sihanouk said: "Premier, please bring the friendship of the Cambodian people to the Chinese people, and hope that even though you have left here, your heart will often think of Cambodia!" Yes, this friendly gathering of leaders of the Chinese and Cambodian governments will leave an indelible and profound impression in the hearts of the people of both countries and further promote the friendly relations between the two countries.

    中柬两国人民的深厚友谊
    定民
    虽然已经是初冬，金边的阳光照在头上还觉得热烘烘的。据说，这里的雨季刚刚过去，天气将会慢慢凉爽起来。但是，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理到达坡成东机场的那一天（11月22日），中午的天气特别炎热。从机场到市中心的王宫，一层又一层的欢迎群众，成群结队排列在马路的两旁。金边市的居民几乎全部都到街上参加了这个盛大的节日。从金边附近各地来的欢迎群众，早在前一天暮色苍茫的时候就动身了。还有远从全国各地赶来的参加欢迎队伍的人们。所有欢迎的人都穿着节日的盛装，手里扬着中、柬两国的国旗，欢呼着，歌唱着。
    笑容可掬的西哈努克亲王和王室、政府的官员，机场上雄赳赳的仪仗队，生气勃勃的童子军队伍，夹道欢迎的市民和农民，服装鲜艳的少女，披着黄色袈裟行合十礼的和尚……每一个人都是那样地热情。“中柬人民友谊万岁！”的口号声和沸腾似的鼓掌声融成一片。我坐在车中噙着热泪，深深地为柬埔寨人民对中国人民的友好而感动。
    在金边的几天中，在招待周总理和贺副总理居住的王宫门前，无论是清晨或傍晚，甚至于午夜以后，只要有汽车出入，沿途总是有无数群众在那里列队欢呼。在磅湛市和暹粒市，周总理和贺副总理汽车走过的街道两旁，都是密密层层的欢呼着的群众。最令人难忘的是从金边乘皇家海军的船只沿湄公河支流沙河去访问重要渔镇贝昂希腊累的路途上，绵延七十公里，两岸中柬两国国旗招展，有些地方还扎着彩牌坊，到处有欢呼的群众。其中有人是从三十公里、甚至于从七十公里以外赶来远远地望一望船上的中国客人的。
    在船上，西哈努克亲王对周总理说：
  “总理先生，所有柬埔寨的人民都想看到您，瞻仰您的丰采。虽然您在我国访问的日程很紧，但我们仍保留了这个节日，为的是不让沿湄公河的居民、西北部的农民和渔民说我们对金边、磅湛、暹粒各地人民有所偏爱。”
    从柬埔寨人民的脸上的微笑和他们的欢呼声中，我们不但体会到中柬两国人民之间深厚的友谊，也体会到一个受过数百年外族压迫的民族获得了独立的愉快心情，以及他们对于维护和平的信心。他们这样热诚地欢迎周总理，是因为他是一个伟大的热爱和平的邻邦的代表，是和平共处五项原则的倡导者之一，是“一位和平和友谊的使者”（桑云首相语）。
    在金边政府大厦举行的一次欢迎周总理的晚会上，柬埔寨的青年们演出了一出新编的独幕剧，主题是“柬埔寨采取和平共处五项原则”。这出戏的情节、布景、化装都很简单，但是感人很深，因为它反映了柬埔寨人民对和平共处的信念。幕启时，是木工、制糖工人、舂米工人和织布女工正在劳动，一个年长的小学教员约他们到国家戏院去看名叫“战争的根源”的戏。这个戏中之戏是几个人站在板凳上打来打去，以后都倒下去了，这表示侵略者的失败。最后台上出现了象征和平共处的巨人。人们不再吵打而进行友好的经济合作和文化交流，和平和繁荣的景象出现，人们的生活也逐渐幸福起来了。
    柬埔寨人民这种愿望不是空想而是现实。我们从陆地、水上和空中，都能看到柬埔寨肥沃的土地，连绵的森林，秀美的山地，丰富的物产。地底下的富藏更是无法估计。智慧和勤劳的柬埔寨人民今天已经有了发展经济的和平环境。西哈努克所拟定的两年建设计划正由王国政府执行。但是由于过去殖民主义者的剥削和掠夺，生产没有发展，建设中还有一些困难。因此，他们珍视从友好国家得到的合作和援助。在这次周总理访问期间，到处可以看到“感谢中国的援助”的横幅中柬文的标语。报纸上赞扬它，王国政府从首相到各部部长和各地首长的演说和谈话中，也不断地提到它；虽然周恩来总理曾经一再表示我们的援助是“微不足道”的。柬埔寨人民之所以特别珍视中苏等国的援助，这是因为这种援助不附带任何条件，是一种兄弟或朋友之间的相互帮助。
    周恩来总理在柬埔寨作友好访问期间，我们参观了雅亚瓦曼博物馆，那里面陈列着满目琳琅的古代器皿；伟大的银塔建筑，以及附近的生动的壁画。那上面不但画着柬埔寨人民的日常生活，也描绘着古代柬埔寨人民和邻国、尤其是和中国之间的通商关系文化交流情况。其中还有许多动人的壁画，表现出古代柬埔寨人反抗外来侵略，并把侵略者从自己的土地上驱逐出去的英雄故事。从飞机上，我们也看到了柬埔寨的先辈们兴建的巨大的灌溉水道，看到了九世纪到十四世纪的王国故都的遗迹。在十二世纪兴建的吴哥窟、巴容寺、吾哥通等古庙和石塔建筑上，保存着许多石刻、浮雕和佛像，都是稀有的珍贵的艺术品。它们不仅代表柬埔寨人民古代的高度文化，而且是世界人类宝贵的文化遗产之一。
    我们也欣赏了王后亲自导演的古典舞蹈，富有诗意的抒情短剧，印度古代神话巴拉森的故事，新年和宗教节日时常表演的土风舞和诺罗敦王朝的玛贺丽古乐，也欣赏了柬埔寨近代的优美的民间舞蹈和娓娓动人的音乐。我们也看到了根据古代民间传统的风俗，每年一度的水节时所表演的龙舟竞赛的热闹场面。
    在金边市内，我们参观了代表柬埔寨的一些近代文化教育的机构，如博物馆、艺术学校、医学院和工艺学校，使我们深深地了解到：柬埔寨人民一方面保存了固有的优秀文化，同时在努力学习现代文化，以提高人民的文化水平，并且愿意和世界上所有各国人民，尤其是和中国人民恢复并发展文化交流的关系，共同前进。
    西哈努克亲王在周恩来总理临行时说：“总理先生，请把柬埔寨人民的友谊带给中国人民，并且希望您虽然离开了这里，您的心时常想念着柬埔寨！”是的，中柬两国政府领导人员的这次友好聚会，将在两国人民的心中都留下不可磨灭的深刻印象，更加促进两国的友好关系。（附图片）
