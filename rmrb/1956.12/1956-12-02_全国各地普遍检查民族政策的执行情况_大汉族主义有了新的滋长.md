Nationwide Inspection of the Implementation of Ethnic Policies
Han Chauvinism Experiences New Growth

　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch - A nationwide inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies is underway. Some regions have found that Han chauvinism has experienced new growth in the past year or two during the inspection.

　　This inspection work began in early June this year and has been carried out in ten provinces and autonomous regions. Yunnan, Henan, and Hebei provinces are now nearing completion. Gansu Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are still undergoing inspection. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province are making comprehensive arrangements. The United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China have also sent working groups to Gansu and Guangdong to assist in the inspection.

　　In recent years, various tasks in the ethnic minority areas of our country have developed rapidly. At present, the work of promoting ethnic regional autonomy has been completed in the vast majority of ethnic minority areas across the country, and more than 200,000 ethnic minority cadres have been trained. The relationship of unity and cooperation among all ethnic groups has been consolidated and developed. However, some regions and units have also made many shortcomings and mistakes in the implementation of ethnic policies.

　　According to the existing inspection results, when some ethnic minority areas were carrying out democratic reforms and socialist transformation, some Han cadres working locally ignored the development characteristics of various ethnic minorities, and did not fully consult with the people of various ethnic minorities and the leaders who had contact with the masses, to carry out reforms according to the wishes of the ethnic minorities. Some Han cadres even took over everything and replaced patient mass work with issuing orders, regardless of the local people's level of awareness and natural conditions. In the movement of agricultural cooperativization, emphasis was placed on running large cooperatives and advanced cooperatives. For example, the large cooperative in Mashan Township, Wangmo County, Guizhou Province, covered a range of fifty or sixty li, had no accountant, no labor quotas, no reasonable scoring, and no clear accounts. The Miao cooperative chairman said: "I don't even know where the cooperative's land is!" Some places even forced the local Miao, Yao and other ethnic groups to include their highly valued sacred cattle, feng shui ridges, and Malang slopes into the cooperative, arousing dissatisfaction among the ethnic minorities.

　　In terms of promoting ethnic regional autonomy, some ethnic minorities in some regions have not fully enjoyed the right to autonomy. In the autonomous organs of those autonomous regions, Han cadres have the tendency of distrusting ethnic minority cadres, not respecting the authority of ethnic minority cadres, not daring to boldly promote ethnic minority cadres, and even discriminating against ethnic minority cadres. For example, in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, only seven of the thirty-six bureau chiefs and deputy bureau chiefs were Zhuang; all the ministers and deputy ministers of the Party committee were Han. In April of this year, the Urad Middle and Rear United Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region dismissed seventeen Mongolian cadres home on the grounds of "low cultural level" and recruited more than twenty Han graduates from senior primary schools. When the Han president of the People's Court of Libo County, Guizhou Province, tried a case, he even asked the ethnic minority county head to sit aside and act as his translator.

　　Some places have not promptly solved the urgent needs of ethnic minorities and are indifferent to their suffering. For example, the ethnic minorities in the Greater Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia have many difficulties in production, the people's living standards have begun to decline, and fifteen villages have been relocated due to the prevalence of diseases, but the relevant departments have not taken effective measures so far.

　　During the inspection, some areas also found that Han cadres and Han people did not respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, and even forced ethnic minority women to change clothes and cut their hair.

　　The inspections in various places show that the main reason for the above shortcomings and mistakes is that with the rapid progress of work in ethnic minority areas, the Han chauvinistic ideology of some Han cadres and people has grown. They are proud and complacent, and wrongly believe that the ethnic problem has been fundamentally solved due to the completion of democratic reform and socialist transformation, and therefore do not pay attention to ethnic issues and ignore the role of ethnic minority people in the socialist construction of the motherland.

　　In this inspection, all localities conducted a comprehensive inspection of general issues based on their specific circumstances, and focused on studying the most prominent issues in their localities.

　　This inspection work mostly adopted methods such as summarizing work, holding symposiums, and conducting in-depth investigations and visits, extensively listening to the opinions and requirements of ethnic minority people, fully exposing the shortcomings and errors in various tasks, criticizing Han chauvinistic ideology and work style, and improving the policy and ideological level of cadres. After Yunnan Province found the shortcoming of generalizing leadership in high and cold mountainous areas during the inspection, many counties established working committees in high and cold mountainous areas to carry out work according to the specific conditions and characteristics of the mountainous areas. After listening to the opinions of the Zhuang people, the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPC held an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee to specifically discuss the nationalization of autonomous organs.

　　The progress and depth of the inspection of the implementation of ethnic policies across the country are still very uneven. The CPC committees in some areas have ignored the importance of this work and have not yet made an inspection plan; in some areas, the lower levels have started the inspection, but the leading organs and enterprise organs have not yet taken action; some only take care of the key points and ignore the overall inspection; some only organize cadres to study ethnic policies.

### 全国各地普遍检查民族政策的执行情况　大汉族主义有了新的滋长

　　全国各地普遍检查民族政策的执行情况
　　大汉族主义有了新的滋长
    全国绝大部分少数民族聚居区，已完成推行民族区域自治的工作，但是在执行民族政策中，也发生了不少缺点和错误。有的不从少数民族特点出发工作，有的汉族干部包办代替各种工作，有的地区没有使少数民族充分享有自治的权利，有的不尊重少数民族干部的职权，有的不敢大胆提拔民族干部，有的对少数民族的迫切要求没有及时解决。
    新华社1日讯　全国各地正在检查民族政策的执行情况。有些地区在检查中，发现大汉族主义近一两年来有了新的滋长。
    这项检查工作从今年6月初开始，先后在十个省和自治区进行。云南、河南和河北等省现在已接近结束。甘肃省和内蒙古自治区，现在还在进行检查。新疆维吾尔自治区和青海省正在作全面布置。中共中央统一战线工作部和中华人民共和国民族事务委员会也已派出工作组到甘肃、广东帮助检查。
    近年来，我国各少数民族地区的各项工作已有迅速发展。目前，全国绝大部分少数民族聚居区，已完成了推行民族区域自治的工作，并培养出少数民族干部二十多万名。各民族团结合作的关系得到了巩固和发展。但是，有些地区和有些单位在执行民族政策中，也发生了不少缺点和错误。
    根据现有的检查结果来看，有些少数民族地区在进行民主改革和社会主义改造的时候，在当地工作的一些汉族干部，忽视了各少数民族发展的特点，没有和各少数民族人民以及与人民群众有联系的领袖人物充分商量，按照少数民族的意愿去进行改革。有的汉族干部甚至包办代替，不顾当地人民的觉悟水平和自然条件，用发号施令的办法代替了耐心的群众工作。在农业合作化的运动中，强调办大社，办高级社。例如，贵州省望谟县麻山乡办的大社，范围达五、六十里，没有会计，没有劳动定额，没有合理评分和清楚的账目。苗族社长说：“我还不知道社里的地在哪儿呢？”有些地方在办社时，还强迫当地苗、瑶等族人民把他们十分重视的神牛、风水岭、马郎坡等也入了社，引起少数民族人民的不满。
    在推行民族区域自治方面，有些地区的少数民族还没有充分享有自治的权利。在那些自治地方的自治机关里，汉族干部存在着不信任少数民族干部、不尊重少数民族干部职权，不敢大胆提拔民族干部甚至歧视少数民族干部的倾向。例如，桂西僮族自治州三十六名局长、副局长干部中，只有七名是僮族；党委的各部部长和副部长，全部都是汉族。内蒙古自治区乌拉特中后联合旗今年4月曾经以“文化水平低”的理由将十七名蒙古族干部解职回家，另外吸收了二十多名汉族高小毕业生。贵州荔波县人民法院汉族院长在审案时，竟然要少数民族县长坐在一边为他当翻译。
    有的地方对少数民族的迫切要求，没有及时加以解决，对他们的疾苦也漠不关心。例如，内蒙古大兴安岭的少数民族，生产上存在很多困难，人民生活已开始下降，并且由于疾病流行，已有十五个屯子的人搬了家，但是有关部门到现在还没有采取有效措施。
    有些地区在检查中，还发现汉族干部和汉族人民群众对少数民族的风俗习惯不够尊重，甚至强迫少数民族妇女换装剪发。
    各地检查的情况表明，产生上述缺点和错误的主要原因，是随着少数民族地区工作的迅速进展，一部分汉族干部和人民群众的大汉族主义思想有了滋长。他们骄傲自满，错误地认为由于民主改革和社会主义改造的完成，民族问题已经根本上解决了，因而不重视民族问题，忽视少数民族人民在祖国社会主义建设中的作用。
    各地在这次检查中，大都根据当地的具体情况，对一般性的问题进行了全面检查，并着重研究了当地最突出的问题。
    这项检查工作，大都采取总结工作、召开座谈会和深入调查访问等方式，广泛听取了少数民族人民的意见和要求，充分揭发各项工作中的缺点和错误，批判了大汉族主义思想作风，使干部提高政策思想水平。云南省在检查中发现过去对高寒山区存在领导一般化的缺点后，许多县都成立了高寒山区工作委员会，根据山区的具体情况和特点来进行工作。中共广西省委听取了僮族人民的意见后，举行了省委扩大会议，专门讨论了自治机关民族化问题。
    全国各地检查民族政策执行情况的进度和检查深度，还很不平衡。有些地区的中共党委忽视这一工作的重要性，至今没有作出检查计划；有的地区下面开始检查了，而领导机关和企业机关还没有行动起来；有的只照顾到重点，忽视全面检查；有的只组织干部学习了一下民族政策。
