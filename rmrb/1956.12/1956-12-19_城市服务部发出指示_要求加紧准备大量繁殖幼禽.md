    City Service Department Issues Instructions
    Demanding Intensified Preparations for Large-Scale Breeding of Poultry
    (Our Newspaper reports) The City Service Department issued instructions on the 12th of this month regarding the vigorous development of poultry hatching and production. The instructions stated that raising poultry is a rural sideline with low investment, high profits, and quick turnover. Vigorously developing poultry production can increase farmers' income and increase poultry manure fertilizer. In the current situation where pork supply is falling short of demand, expanding the supply of poultry meat is even more significant. The primary key to developing poultry production is to effectively organize the hatching of young poultry. All regions should seize the current opportunity to prepare for spring hatching next year. To this end, the instructions put forward the following requirements: First, food companies in all regions should, as far as possible, organize and utilize the hatching and production forces in society. Hatcheries that have closed down should be helped to resume operations as much as possible. People with rich experience in hatching work who have lost their jobs should be helped to organize and engage in production. The production eggs needed by the hatcheries should be organized by the producers for adjustment. If the hatcheries have financial difficulties, appropriate assistance can be given. Food companies should also guide and organize the sales of hatchery products so that the hatcheries can produce normally. Second, small traders and peddlers who sell poultry seedlings should be supported to continue their business, and food companies in all regions should be responsible for carrying out socialist transformation. Small vendors who used to operate poultry seedlings should also be helped to resume operations based on the actual situation. Third, for the production of hatcheries in agricultural production cooperatives, food companies should assist the agricultural departments in overall planning, provide technical guidance, and assist in the adjustment of seed eggs. Fourth, food companies in large cities and suburban areas of medium-sized cities with conditions should plan to establish hatcheries to increase the number of young poultry. Fifth, the feed required for commercial hatcheries can be determined according to actual needs, and the food company will prepare and report the plan, applying to the grain department for appropriate supply. Sixth, food companies in all regions should strive to assist agricultural departments in extensively promoting excellent breeds of poultry; at the same time, they should do a good job in poultry epidemic prevention and vigorously and with emphasis inoculate plague prevention vaccines.

    城市服务部发出指示
    要求加紧准备大量繁殖幼禽
    本报讯　城市服务部在本月12日发出关于大力发展家禽孵化生产的指示。指示说，饲养家禽是投资少、获利多、周转快的农村副业，大力发展家禽生产，可以增加农民收入，增加禽类粪肥。在当前猪肉供不应求的情况下，扩大家禽肉类的供应，更具有重要的意义。发展家禽生产的首要关键是很好地组织雏禽的孵化工作。各地应该在目前抓紧时机，为明年春孵作好准备工作。为此，指示提出了以下几点要求：第一、各地食品公司应该尽可能把社会上的孵化，生产力量加以组织、利用；已经歇业的孵房，要帮助它们尽可能恢复起来。已经失业的对孵化工作富有经验的人，应尽力帮助他们组织起来进行生产。孵房所需的种蛋，要负责组织生产者进行调剂，孵房的资金如果有困难，可给以适当扶助。食品公司还要指导和组织孵房产品的推销，使孵房能够正常生产。第二、贩卖禽苗的小商小贩，应该扶助他们继续经营，由各地食品公司负责进行社会主义改造。过去经营禽苗的小商贩，也应该根据实际情况，帮助他们恢复经营。第三、对于农业生产合作社的孵房的生产，食品公司要协助农业部门统筹计划，给予技术指导，协助调剂种蛋。第四、大城市和有条件的中等城市郊区的食品公司，要有计划地建立孵房，增殖幼禽。第五、商业性质的孵房所需的饲料，可根据实际需要，确定供应标准，由食品公司造报计划，申请粮食部门适当供应。第六、各地食品公司应该努力协助农业部门大量推广家禽的优良品种；同时要作好家禽的防疫工作，大力地有重点地接种防瘟疫苗。
