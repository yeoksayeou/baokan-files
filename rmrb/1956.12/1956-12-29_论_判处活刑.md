    On "Sentencing to Living Death"
    Wu Gaolun
    During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, our Central People's Government created a provision for "sentencing to death with a reprieve." Some gentlemen in capitalist countries said that this was a more cruel law than the death penalty, because the sentenced person was living under the "threat" of death every day, which was worse than dying early. If this statement is not a malicious attack with ulterior motives, it is at least a great misunderstanding. In fact, after making such a provision, our government used all means to help the sentenced person strive for a future of living forever, and strive for a future where the execution would never be carried out. Therefore, this is the most humane law in special circumstances. That's just a digression, let's leave it aside for now.
    However, after liberation, I felt that in one of our circles—the newspaper, magazine, and publishing circles—a law that is somewhat detrimental to "humanity" has indeed been created. The name of this law can be called "sentencing to living death, to be carried out for a long time."
    What does this mean? This means that after receiving a manuscript, it often takes months or even years to get a result. If you say it's dead, they didn't simply return it and explain that it's not being used; if you say it's alive, it's not published for three or five months, or three or five years, which can only be said to be trembling in fear and enduring a long-term "living death."
    Living death one, is receiving the manuscript and not hearing anything for years, not even a receipt. Time flies, how many times can one wait like this in a lifetime?
    Living death two, is asking the author to supplement and revise countless times. The editors don't know that "a few days in the mountains is like thousands of years in the world," how can we "catch up with reality" by supplementing like this?
    Living death three, is being cautious and having many people review it over and over, like a basketball team with no training, tossing it around but never getting it into the hoop.
    Works are like one's own babies. If a person's baby is taken away by others to study whether it is full-term, whether its features are complete, whether it has genetic diseases, etc., and there is no news for three or five years, imagine how much pain the mother feels?
    I, the author, am one of the staff members in the editorial circle, and sometimes I inevitably participate in this kind of "sentencing to living death, long-term execution" judgment, which is really a "shame to the public opinion, guilt to the gods," which we call "losing virtue" in our place. Although I have constantly struggled against this kind of imprisonment, there has been no great result, and even the atmosphere of a small unit cannot be changed, isn't this a bit sad?
    In addition to editorial work, sometimes my own hands itch, and I occasionally write something that doesn't look like an article, and I have tasted the taste of this "sentencing to living death" many times. Several times it was like this: a short article of a thousand words has been approved for publication, and a phone call says (once it was on a Saturday night), please be sure to revise it tonight, and it will be published tomorrow or in this issue. After you do so truthfully, there is no news for a month or two, and they don't tell you why. I don't want to say that this is "bureaucratism," I would rather say that it is detrimental to humanity.
    What I have said above could probably be called "unwritten" law in the past few years, but recently this law has gradually become a "written law," which is even more intolerable to remain silent. As everyone knows, recently many newspapers and periodicals have gradually stipulated explicitly that if a submitted manuscript is not published, it will not be returned individually, and no comments will be attached to the returned manuscript. I think this regulation cannot be said to be wrong. Those familiar with the inside story know that sometimes a small magazine's editorial department has dozens of people, and most of the manpower is used for returning manuscripts, replying to letters, making suggestions, and communication and liaison, but the magazine is still not well-run. Therefore, appropriately reducing this part of the work cannot be said to be without reason. However, I recently saw a call for papers from a publication that is almost turning "sentencing to living death" into "written law." This notice said: "Because the editorial department has too few staff, it is impossible to return every manuscript, so manuscripts are generally not returned." Just now it was "impossible to return every manuscript," and suddenly it became "manuscripts are generally not returned," and the wonderful part is still behind—immediately following the above two sentences is: "If you have not received our reply two months after sending the manuscript, it means it will not be used." What kind of "advanced working method" is this? It can be said to be the most convenient for the editorial department, but it is a bit cold for the authors. This is like saying, "no news" means "no news," how unreasonable is this! For the author, the coldness is not limited to this, because the author will also imagine: it's not that it won't be used, is it that the manuscript has not been received? Is it because there are too many manuscripts and mine has not been arranged yet? Is there some temporary "movement" and there is not enough manpower for a while? In short, he may become an unrequited lover who will never give up. A wordless answer is a sign of contempt and indifference, which should be eliminated in all our work, especially not to those who think that "one's own article is the best."
    Let's not be one-sided, this kind of "sentencing to living death, long-term execution" is sometimes fought for by the author himself. For example, some people insist on writing 500,000 words or 1 million words when 100,000 words would have been enough; some people insist on calling it a "creation" that can be published when it is originally a patchwork product taken from several books; some people insist on saying how messy other people's translations are and how faithful, expressive, and elegant their own translations are when it is originally a translation with slight changes from an existing translation; some people boast of being a great work with many "inventions" and no word can be changed when it is originally copied from common books (for experts) without any standards. ... All this is unnecessary for "scholars." My main occupation is editor, based on the ancient meaning of "being strict with oneself and lenient with others," I am not able to discuss the latter in depth here.
    Sorry, the focus should still be on my colleagues: I would also like to ask for some kind of blessing, hoping that this article will not be "sentenced to living death."

    论“判处活刑”
    吴高伦
    在镇压反革命的时候，我们的中央人民政府创设了一条“判处死刑，缓期执行”的规定。有些资本主义国家的先生们说，这是一条比死刑还要残酷的法律，因为被判处者天天都在死刑的“威胁”中，还不如早死的好。这种说法，如果不是别具用心的恶意的攻击，至少也是一种很大的误会。事实上，在作了这样的规定之后，我们的政府就在用一切的方法来帮助被判处者争取永远活下去的前途，争取永不执行的前途。所以，这是一条在特殊情形下的最人道的法律。这是闲话，暂且按下不说。
    但是，在解放以后，我却觉得在我们的一个界——报纸、杂志和出版界中，倒真是创造了一条有点有伤“人道”的法律了。这条法律的名称可以叫做“判处活刑，长期执行”。
    这话怎解呢？这就是说，收到一部或者一篇稿子之后，往往几个月，甚至几年都没有结果。说死吗，并没有干脆退回说明不用；说活吗，三月五月、三年五载不见发表出来，这只能说是战战兢兢地在承受一种长期的“活刑”。
    活刑之一，是收到稿件后经年累月不见动静，连收条也没有一张。岁月易逝，人生一世能够这样等待几次？
    活刑之二，是要作者无数次的补充、修改。编辑同志却不知道“山中才数日，世上几千年”，这样补充下去，何日能够“赶上现实”？
    活刑之三，是为了慎重而由很多人审来审去，就像没有一点训练的篮球队，抛来抛去，就是抛不进圈。
    作品就像自己的婴儿。如果一个人的婴儿，生下地来，就被别人抱去研究他是否足月，是否五官周全，是否有遗传病等等，而且三年五载，渺无音信，你想，身为母亲的人的痛苦为何如？
    笔者忝为编辑界工作人员之一，有时也不免参与了这种“判处活刑，长期执行”的判决，这实在是一件“外惭清议，内疚神明”的，我们那地方叫做“丧德”的事情。我虽然也曾为了反对这种徒刑而不断地奋斗过，但是却没有什么大结果，甚至一个小小单位的空气也变不过来，这不是有些可悲么？
    除了编辑的工作而外，有时候我自己也手痒起来，偶尔写点不像文章的文章，就曾经尝过多次这种“判处活刑”的味道。有几次甚至于是这样的：千把字的短文，已蒙恩准刊用，一个电话来说（有一次是星期六晚上），请你务必在今晚改好，明天或本期就刊用。等你如实照办之后，一个月、两个月没有下文，也不对你说个所以。这种事情，我不愿说他是“官僚主义”，更愿说他是有伤人道。
    以上所说，在过去几年，大概可以称为“不成文”法，但近来这条法律渐渐有变为“成文法”的趋势，这就更不能令人默尔而息了。大家知道，近来有很多报刊，都逐渐明文规定，来稿如不刊用，恕不能一一退回，退回的也不能附上意见。我想，这个规定不能说是错误的。熟悉内幕的人就知道，有时一个小小杂志的编辑部，一来就是几十个人，大部分的人力都用在退稿、复信、提意见、通讯联络等事情上，但是杂志还是没有办好。所以适当地减少这一部分工作，不能说是没有理由的。但是，最近看见一个刊物的征稿启事，就差不多要把“判处活刑”变成“成文法”了。这个启事说：“因编辑部人手太少，无法做到每稿必退，故一般不退稿。”刚才是“无法做到每稿必退”，一下就变成“一般不退稿”了，而且妙文还在后面——紧接上面两句的是：“稿件寄来后，上了两个月尚未收到我们的回信，即表示不用了”。这是一种什么“先进工作方法”呢？对编辑部来说可谓省事之至，对作者来说就未免有点冷酷了。这个话就等于说，“没有音信”就表示“没有音信”了，这是多么的不讲道理！对于作者，冷酷处还不只此，因为作者还会设想：不见得不用了吧，是不是稿件没有收到呢？是不是由于稿件太多还没有排到我的头上呢？是不是有什么临时的“运动”一时人力不够呢？总之，他可能变成永不死心的单恋者。无言的回答，是轻蔑和冷淡的表示，这应该在我们的一切工作中都加以肃清的，对于“文章是自己的好”的人们，尤其不应如此。
    话也不要一面倒，这种“判处活刑，长期执行”的事，有时候也是由作者自己争来的。例如，本来十万字可以写完的，有的人坚持要写五十万字或者一百万字；本来是取自几本书的拼凑产物，却硬要说是可以问世的“创作”；本来是就一个现成译本略改几个字的译稿，却非说别人的译文如何一塌胡涂，自己的译文则是如何如何的信达雅不可；本来是从常见书（对专门家来说）上漫无标准地抄来的，却又略欠自知之明地自诩为多所“发明”、一字不可更易的伟著。……凡此，对于“通人”来说，都是大可不必的。我的主要职业是编辑，本“严以责己，宽以待人”的古义，在这里对后者就不便深论了。
    对不起，锋芒还是转回来对着我的同行吧：我也想请求什么的保佑一下，这篇文章也不要被“判处活刑”就好了。
