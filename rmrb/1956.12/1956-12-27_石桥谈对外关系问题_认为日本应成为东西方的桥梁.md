Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 26th: Japan's new Prime Minister Ishibashi Tanzan said at his first foreign reporters' reception after forming his cabinet today that he himself or his Foreign Minister might go to the United States to discuss with the US government leaders the issue of adjusting Japan-US relations. He stated that he does not intend to go to the United States immediately at present, but he believes that negotiations on adjusting Japan-US relations should be conducted when drafting the next fiscal year's budget.

Ishibashi did not specify the specific issues he intends to discuss with the United States. He said that the details of the negotiations are being studied by Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi. Ishibashi explained that the purpose of negotiating with the United States is to enhance the close relationship between Japan and the United States in the past. He said that although Japan and the United States have repeatedly had disputes over minor issues in the past, they want to avoid disputes in the future.

Regarding the issue of Japan-China trade, Ishibashi said that for the sake of the Japanese economy, it is necessary to conduct trade with China in any case. He reiterated his intention to expand trade with China. However, he explained that he wants to expand trade with China within the scope of being a "free country" and a member of the United Nations. He said that he does not believe that doing so will affect Japan's relations with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek Group.

Regarding relations with the Soviet Union, Ishibashi stated that he wants to conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible to resolve the territorial and release of "detained personnel" issues between the two countries.

The 72-year-old Prime Minister also said that Japan wants to provide assistance to Southeast Asian countries in terms of manpower and technology for their development work. For the Asian-African group, it will maintain coordination with it through economic cooperation.

When asked whether Japan would provide troops for an international police force, Ishibashi said that he and his cabinet are racking their brains on how to fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. Due to the constitution, Japan has difficulties in both "defense construction" and participating in UN police actions, but it should do its best in accordance with the principle of maintaining "international coordination." He believes that in today's world, a country's individual "defense" will not be successful. Ishibashi stated that Japan's long-term goal is to contribute to stable peace. He said that he agrees with the view expressed by former Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama that Japan should become a bridge between East and West.

    石桥谈对外关系问题
    认为日本应成为东西方的桥梁
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本新任首相石桥湛山今天在他组阁后的第一次外国记者招待会上说，他自己或者他的外务相可能到美国去和美国政府首脑们讨论调整日美两国的关系问题。他表示目前不打算立刻到美国去，但是他认为要在编制明年度预算的时候进行调整日美关系的谈判。
    石桥没有说明他打算同美国讨论的具体问题。他说，谈判的细节正在由外务相岸信介进行研究。石桥说明，同美国谈判的目的是要增进过去日本同美国的密切关系。他说，过去日美两国虽然屡次为了细小问题发生过纠纷，但是今后想避免发生纠纷。
    关于日中贸易问题，石桥说，为日本经济着想，同中国进行贸易无论如何也是必要的。他再次表示要扩大同中国的贸易。但是他说明，他想要在作为“自由国家”和联合国一员的范围内来扩大同中国的贸易。他说，他并不认为这样做会影响日本同美国和蒋介石集团的关系。
    谈到同苏联的关系时，石桥表示要早日同苏联进行谈判，解决两国间的领土和释放“被扣人员”问题。
    这位七十二岁的首相又说，对于东南亚国家，日本想在人力和技术方面对它们的开发工作进行援助。对亚非集团，将通过经济合作的办法同它保持协调。
    在回答日本是否会为一支国际警察部队提供军队的问题时，石桥说，他和他的内阁对于怎样履行它对联合国的义务问题正在煞费苦心地研究。由于宪法的关系，日本在“防御建设”和参加联合国警察行动方面都存在着困难，但是要尽可能按照保持“国际协调”的方针去做。他认为，在今天，一个国家单独进行“防卫”是不会成功的。石桥表示，日本的长远目的是对稳定的和平作出贡献。他说，他同意前任首相鸠山一郎所表示的日本应该成为东方和西方之间的桥梁的观点。
