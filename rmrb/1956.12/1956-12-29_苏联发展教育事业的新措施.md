    New Measures for the Development of Education in the Soviet Union
    Fang Xuan

    In communist construction, those with a high degree of communist consciousness and mastery of the latest scientific and technological achievements play a primary role. The Soviet Union has made significant achievements in cultivating talent during the past five five-year plans. Today, the Soviet Union has implemented seven-year universal education, and ten-year education has been basically implemented in large cities. In 1955, about 50 million people in the Soviet Union were studying in various schools, an average of one in every four people. The number of Soviet university students is greater than the total number of university students in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and other Western European countries, and it now trains nearly three times as many engineers each year as the United States.

    One of the most important cultural tasks of the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan is to basically achieve universal secondary education in all urban and rural areas. While implementing this huge plan, it is also necessary to overcome the phenomenon of disconnection between teaching and life to a certain extent, and to strive to improve the quality of the work of training educational staff. In the short time since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people have made remarkable achievements in this regard.

    Deep Concern for the Second Generation

    After the start of the new school year this year, the first batch of more than 300 boarding schools have opened. Boarding schools are new to Soviet education and currently focus on enrolling children of single mothers and children of busy working parents. It is worth mentioning that these schools have complete conditions for labor education to promote the all-round development of students' physical and mental health. Boarding schools have various teaching practice factories and practice gardens. Some schools also have land for engaging in sideline production, and the income from factories and sideline production is entirely controlled by the schools. At present, most boarding schools only have grades one to four or grades one to seven. In the next few years, all these boarding schools will be developed into ten-year secondary schools, and by 1960 the number of boarding school students will increase from the current 60,000 to 1 million.

    In ordinary schools, a special extracurricular group is widely organized this year. Students who participate in this group can eat and play at school after class, and have teachers on duty to guide them in their homework before going home.

    In addition, there are many new measures in this new school year. The Soviet Council of Ministers decided to abolish tuition fees for senior grades of secondary schools and universities from September 1 this year, and implemented a new scholarship system in universities and secondary vocational schools. According to the new system, students with a "3" or above in their studies (the old system stipulated that students with a "4" or above) can get a scholarship if they have economic difficulties.

    All these measures fully reflect the deep concern of the Soviet government for the second generation and create more convenient conditions for the study of the vast number of children and young people.

    Close Combination of Teaching and Production

    The close combination of teaching and production is an important part of the development of education in the Soviet Union. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the focus of the distribution of new schools is in important economic construction areas such as northern Soviet Union, eastern Soviet Union, and Siberia. In the past, the distribution of Soviet schools had some unreasonable phenomena. In particular, some specialized schools and scientific research institutions were mostly concentrated in Moscow, far away from the objects of research. This situation will be reversed during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. For example, universities in the Urals, Siberia, Kazakhstan and other regions will train one-third of the specialized personnel for the entire Soviet Union in the next five years; of the more than 360 specialized schools planned to be opened by the Soviet Labor Reserve School Network this year, most are built in the Urals, Siberia and the Far East.

    During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the task facing Soviet secondary schools is to vigorously strengthen comprehensive technical education and overcome the disconnection between teaching and life to a certain extent. Comprehensive technical education began to be promoted during the previous five-year plan. Although some schools have taken relatively few specific measures, many regions have made outstanding achievements in promoting comprehensive technical education. For example, in the Stavropol Territory, there are 122 student production teams, which own a certain amount of land, livestock and production tools. Under the direct guidance of experienced collective farm members, these middle school students cultivated a variety of high-yield crops. In order to implement the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, all parts of the Soviet Union have formulated teaching plans that are closely integrated with production practice. The Russian Federation's plan is now being implemented in 500 secondary schools. The new plan stipulates that a "production foundation" course be offered in grades eight to ten to replace the internship course, and the teaching time is doubled compared with the past, and the production teaching time in other classes is also greatly increased. The new teaching plan is adapted to local conditions: the teaching focus in cities is on industry, and the focus in agricultural areas is on agriculture.

    Improving the Quality of Training Specialized Personnel

    The Soviet Union has achieved brilliant achievements in higher education. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the total number of university graduates exceeded 1.1 million, which is 110 times the total number of university graduates in Russia before the October Revolution. This quantity can basically meet the needs of the current Soviet national economy and scientific and cultural sectors. At present, Soviet universities are focusing their main efforts on improving the quality of training specialized personnel, so that students can closely connect with production and master the latest achievements in science and technology at home and abroad.

    Not long ago, the Soviet Council of Ministers approved regulations on production internships for university students. According to the new regulations, some of the largest and most advanced enterprises in the Soviet Union are designated as bases for student production internships. University students must intern directly at the workplace and directly master the technology. They must not only study the process regulations, but also learn extensive knowledge about production organization and production economics.

    The key to improving the teaching quality of universities to the level of modern science and technology is to vigorously strengthen the scientific research work of university teachers and orient their research work towards production. Recently, the Soviet Council of Ministers specifically adopted a resolution on improving scientific research in universities. The resolution pointed out that when studying theoretical issues that are the foundation of scientific work in universities, we must take improving the technical level of production and accelerating the speed of technical improvement in various sectors of the national economy as prerequisites. University scientific workers also participated in many scientific conferences this year, at which they widely exchanged opinions with scientific workers in production posts. These meetings are of great help in promoting scientific research in universities and combining teaching with the latest modern technology.

    The requirement to improve the quality of training specialized personnel is also reflected in the system for recruiting new students. There is a new regulation this year: people who have participated in production after graduating from middle school and people who have served in the military have priority to enter universities. In this way, there are many more mature people with certain life and production experience among university students. On the other hand, with the development of universal secondary education, more middle school graduates are joining the production front every year, so the network of higher correspondence schools and night schools is constantly expanding. This year, of the 440,000 new students enrolled in Soviet universities, nearly half are studying without leaving production.

    Similarly, the network of secondary education without leaving production is also constantly expanding. In recent years, more than one million people have graduated from youth worker schools in the Russian Federation alone. Young people who graduate from secondary schools without leaving production are a fresh force for universities because they not only have a general secondary education level, but also have rich production knowledge. In the Soviet Union, efforts are being made to create conditions so that in the near future, universities will recruit students through factories, construction sites, collective farms and state farms.

    Higher Requirements for Scientific Cadres

    At present, the Soviet Union is also focusing on the issue of quality in the training of scientific cadres. The outstanding work of Soviet scientists has been commended by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's powerful team of 225,000 scientific workers has aroused the unease of imperialist elements. However, the Soviet Union itself is by no means satisfied with the achievements it has made, and the requirements for scientific workers are becoming more and more strict.

    Recently, the All-Union Higher Attestation Commission, an institution composed of well-known scientists from all over the Soviet Union, is drafting new regulations for awarding degrees to scientific workers. First, the quality requirements for theses have been increased. The All-Union Higher Attestation Commission rejected more than a dozen of the 30 doctoral and associate doctoral dissertations it reviewed some time ago. According to the new regulations, all theses must be published in scientific journals or published as single publications in the future, and can only be submitted for defense after being discussed by the scientific community. The requirements for graduate students have also been tightened: with a few exceptions, only those who have practical knowledge and writings in the scientific field they have chosen can become graduate students. After three years of graduate studies, they must pass the associate doctoral qualification examination, conduct teaching internships, and report their completed research work to the academic committee or scientific committee of the institute. If it is finally proved that this research work cannot be the basis for a thesis, then he can receive a graduate diploma and return to his previous job.

    This year is the first year of the implementation of the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan. However, from these positive measures taken in the Soviet education sector at the beginning of this plan, it can be foreseen that when the new five-year plan is completed, the ranks of Soviet communist builders will develop into a huge and strong army armed with the latest achievements in modern science and technology.

    The decrease in the number of students in ordinary secondary schools in 1956 is due to the fact that the children who should have attended school in 1949 and subsequent years were born during the war years, and the birth rate decreased significantly during the war, especially in the front-line areas and areas occupied by the fascists. The 70,000 students of the newly established 285 boarding schools in September 1956 are not included.

    苏联发展教育事业的新措施
    方萱
    在共产主义建设中，有着高度的共产主义的觉悟和掌握了最新的科学技术成就的人，起着首要的作用。苏联在过去的五个五年计划期间，在培养人材方面取得了重大的成就。今天，全苏联已经实行了七年制的普及教育，在大城市里已经基本上实行了十年制教育。1955年，全苏联约有五千万人在各种学校中学习，平均每四个人中就有一个人学习。苏联大学生的人数比英国、法国、意大利和西欧其他国家大学生的总数还要多，而现在每年培养的工程师将近美国的三倍。
    苏联第六个五年计划在文化方面最重要的任务之一，就是在所有的城市和农村地区基本上实现普及中等教育。在实现这个巨大计划的同时，还要克服教学和生活在一定程度上的脱节现象，努力提高培养教育工作人员的工作质量。在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以后短短的时间里，苏联人民在这方面已经取得了显著的成就。
    对第二代的深切关怀
    今年新学年开始后，第一批三百多所寄宿学校已经开课了。寄宿学校在苏联教育中还是新的东西，目前着重吸收单身母亲的孩子和忙于工作的父母的孩子。值得提起的是，这些学校有为学生们身心全面发展进行劳动教育的完备条件。寄宿学校里有各种教学用的实习工厂和实习园地，有的学校还有从事副业生产的土地，而从工厂和副业生产中得到的收入完全由学校支配。目前，大部分寄宿学校只有一年级至四年级或一年级至七年级。在最近几年，所有这些寄宿学校都要发展成为十年制的中学，而到1960年寄宿学校学生的数目将从现在的六万人增加到一百万人。
    在普通的学校里，今年广泛组织一种专门的课外小组。参加这种小组的学生，下课以后可以在学校吃饭、玩耍，有值日教师指导他们作课外作业，然后再回家。
    此外，在这个新学年里，还有很多新的措施。苏联部长会议决定，从今年9月1日起取消中等学校高年级和高等学校的学费，在大学和中等专业学校里实行了新的助学金制度。按照新制度的规定，学习成绩“三分”以上的学生（旧制度规定是“四分”以上的学生）如果经济困难就可以得到助学金。
    所有这些措施充分体现了苏联政府对第二代的深切关怀，为广大儿童和青年的学习创造了更加便利的条件。
    教学和生产密切结合
    教学和生产密切结合，这是苏联教育发展中的重要一环。在第六个五年计划期间，新建学校分布的重点是在苏联北部、东部、西伯利亚等重要的经济建设地区。苏联学校的分布过去有一些不合理的现象，特别是一些专科学校和科学研究机关多集中在莫斯科，而同研究的对象遥隔千里。在第六个五年计划期间，就要扭转这种情况。例如，乌拉尔、西伯利亚、哈萨克等地区的高等学校今后五年中培养出的专门人材将为全苏联的三分之一；苏联劳动后备学校网在今年计划开办的三百六十多所专科学校中，主要都建立在乌拉尔、西伯利亚和远东等地区。
    在第六个五年计划中，苏联中学面临的任务是，大力加强综合技术教育、克服教学和生活在一定程度上的脱节现象。综合技术教育还在上一个五年计划的时候就开始推行了。尽管有些学校采取的具体措施比较少，可是也有很多地区在推行综合技术教育上作出了突出的成绩。例如，在斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区有一百二十二个学生生产队，它们拥有一定数量的土地、牲口和生产工具。在经验丰富的集体农庄庄员的直接指导下，这些中学生培植了各式各样丰产的农作物。为了贯彻苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，苏联各地都制定了密切结合生产实际的教学计划。俄罗斯联邦的计划，现在正在五百个中学里推行。新计划规定，在八年级到十年级开设一门“生产基础”课代替实习课，教学时间比过去增加两倍，其他班次的生产教学时间也增加了很多。新的教学计划是因地制宜的：城市里的教学重点放在工业上，农业地区则放在农业上。
    提高培养专门人材的工作质量
    苏联在高等教育上取得的成就是辉煌的。在第五个五年计划期间高等学校毕业生总数超过了一百一十万，为十月革命前俄国每年高等学校毕业生总数的一百一十倍。这个数量已能基本上满足现在苏联国民经济和科学文化各部门的需要。目前，苏联高等学校把主要精力放在提高培养专门人材的工作质量上，使学生们密切同生产联系，掌握国内外科学和技术上的最新成就。
    不久以前，苏联部长会议批准了关于高等学校学生生产实习的条例。根据新条例，全苏联一些最大的先进企业划为学生生产实习的基地。高等学校的学生必须直接在工作地点实习，直接掌握技术。他们不仅要研究工艺规程，同时也要学习有关生产组织和生产经济等广泛的知识。
    把高等学校的教学质量提高到现代科学技术水平的关键，是大力加强高等学校教师的科学研究工作，使他们的研究工作面向生产。最近，苏联部长会议专门通过了一项关于改进高等学校中科学研究工作的决议。决议指出，在研究作为高等学校科学工作基础的理论问题时，必须以全力提高生产的技术水平和加快国民经济各部门技术改进的速度为前提。高等学校科学工作者今年也参加了很多科学会议，在会上同生产岗位的科学工作者广泛交换了意见。这些会议对于促进高等学校的科学研究工作，使教学同现代最新技术相结合，有很大的帮助。
    提高培养专门人材工作质量的要求，也反映在招收新生的制度上。今年有一个新规定：中学毕业后参加过生产的人和在军队中服过役的人有进高等学校的优先权。这样，在高等学校的学生里，就有很多比较成熟的、有一定生活和生产经验的人。另一方面，随着普及中等教育的开展，每年有更多的中学毕业生投入生产战线，所以，高等函授学校和夜校网在不断扩大。今年，苏联高等学校招收的四十四万新生里，将近半数是不脱离生产学习的。
    同样，不脱离生产的中等教育网也在不断扩大。最近几年，仅只在俄罗斯联邦青年工人学校毕业的就有一百多万人。从不脱离生产的中学里毕业的青年，是高等学校的生力军，因为他们不仅具备了一般中等教育水平，而且拥有丰富的生产知识。在苏联，正在努力创造条件，以便在最近的将来，高等学校通过工厂、建筑工地、集体农庄和国营农场招收学生。
    对科学干部的要求更高了
    目前，苏联在培养科学干部方面也同样把质量问题作为重心。苏联科学家们的卓著成效的工作受到苏共第二十次代表大会的表扬。苏联这支由二十二万五千人组成的科学工作者的强大队伍，已引起了帝国主义分子的不安。但是苏联自己却丝毫不满足于已取得的成就，而且对科学工作者的要求一天比一天更加严格了。
    最近，由全苏著名的科学家组成的机构——全苏最高评议委员会——正在拟订授予科学工作者学位的新条例。首先，对论文的质量要求提高了。全苏最高评议委员会前些时候在审核三十篇博士和副博士论文时就否决了十多篇。按照新的规定，今后所有的学位论文，都必须在科学杂志上发表或出单行本，并经过科学界讨论以后，才能提出进行答辩。对研究生的要求也严格了：除少数例外，只有具有实践知识和所选的科学部门的著作的人才能当研究生。研究生学习三年后，必须经过副博士资格的考试，进行教学实习，向研究所学术委员会或科学委员会报告自己所完成的研究工作。如果最后证明，这个研究工作不能作论文的基础，那么他可以领取研究生毕业证书回到从前的工作岗位上去。
    今年是苏联第六个五年计划实施的第一年。但是，就在这个计划的开始阶段，从苏联教育方面采取的这些积极的措施中可以预见到，在新五年计划完成的时候，苏联共产主义建设者的队伍，将发展成为一支被现代最新科学技术成就武装起来的、庞大而坚强的大军。（附图片）

    从事业余学习的工人数目
    中等专业学校和技术学校的学生人数
    高等学校的学生人数
    1956年普通中等学校学生人数的减少是由于在1949年和以后几年中应当上学的儿童正出生战争年代，而在战争时期人口出生率大大减少，特别是在前线地区和被法西斯占领地区。1956年9月新成立的二百八十五所寄宿学校的七万学生没有包括在内。
