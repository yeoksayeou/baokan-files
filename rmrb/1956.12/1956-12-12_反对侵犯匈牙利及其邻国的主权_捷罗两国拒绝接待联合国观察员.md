Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from New York: Czechoslovakian representative to the UN, Ulihe, notified UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on December 9th that Czechoslovakia could not accept UN observers into Czechoslovakia to investigate the Hungarian incident.

The note from the Czechoslovakian government, conveyed by Ulihe, stated that the UN had no right to investigate the Hungarian incident. Sending UN observers to Hungary or Hungary’s neighboring countries would be an infringement upon the sovereignty of these countries.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from New York: Romania notified UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on December 10th that Romania refused to investigate the so-called "Hungarian situation" on its territory.

Prior to this, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia had also stated that they could not receive UN observers.

The Romanian representative to the UN, Athanase Joina, said in his letter to Hammarskjöld: “The Romanian government is concerned with the normalization of life in its friendly neighbor, Hungary, and considering that such normalization is in line with the interests of European peace and security, and also in line with the principles of national sovereignty, it cannot receive UN observers on the territory of the Romanian People’s Republic.”

    反对侵犯匈牙利及其邻国的主权
    捷罗两国拒绝接待联合国观察员
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：捷克斯洛伐克驻联合国代表乌里赫12月9日通知联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德说，捷克斯洛伐克不能接受联合国观察员到捷克斯洛伐克调查匈牙利事件。
    由乌里赫转交的捷克斯洛伐克政府的照会说，联合国无权调查匈牙利事件。派联合国观察员到匈牙利或者匈牙利的邻国去，将是对这些国家的主权的侵犯。
    新华社11日讯　纽约消息：罗马尼亚10日通知联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德说，罗马尼亚拒绝在它的领土上调查所谓“匈牙利局势”问题。
    在这以前，南斯拉夫和捷克斯洛伐克也已经表示，它们不能接待联合国观察员。
    罗马尼亚驻联合国代表阿散斯·约尼亚在他给哈马舍尔德的信中说：“罗马尼亚政府关心它友好的邻国匈牙利的生活正常化，并且考虑到这种正常化符合欧洲和平和安全的利益，也符合国家的主权原则，因此，它不能在罗马尼亚人民共和国的领土上接待联合国观察员。”
