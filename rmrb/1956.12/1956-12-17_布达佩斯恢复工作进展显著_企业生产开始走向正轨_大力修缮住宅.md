Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 16th—Kalman Pongracz, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Budapest City Council, briefed Xinhua reporter Li Nan on the progress of the recovery work in Budapest on the 15th. Pongracz said: The progress of the recovery work has been very obvious in the past few days. Now, 60 of the capital's 96 cinemas have been opened. From the 16th, six theaters, including the opera house, will begin performing. In addition, two-thirds of the buses have resumed operation, and 1,800 trams are running.

Pongracz said that the City Council is mobilizing vehicles to begin clearing the debris and garbage that has accumulated for more than a month. This is a considerable task, requiring 200 vehicles to work for nearly a month. He said that the revolutionary committees within the various organs have ceased their activities, and the Communist Party members who were illegally dismissed in the past have gradually returned to their posts.

Pongracz then said that the City Council is formulating a plan for the future administrative work of Budapest in accordance with the program of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. In the future, its work will be more proactive, more concerned about the needs of the people, and more widely listen to opinions from all sides.

Pongracz once participated in a delegation from the Budapest City Council that visited China, and only returned to Budapest on October 17. He said that after visiting Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, he had a good impression of all aspects of China. He said that he sincerely thanked and congratulated the people of Beijing. He said that he had invited Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen to visit Budapest next year. He hoped that by that time, Budapest would be completely restored to its former appearance, and even better than before.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th—TASS Budapest, 15th: Production in Budapest's industrial enterprises has begun to get back on track. The Csepel Metallurgical United Works, "Lange," "Mavag," "Ganz" and other giant factories, and shipyards have all produced industrial finished products. Food enterprises, light industry, and the construction industry have all started smoothly. The main obstacle to restoring full industrial production is still the lack of coal and electricity. In response to the call of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, miners are increasing coal production every day.

The Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the Executive Committee of the Budapest City Council are paying great attention to repairing the damaged houses. Many cities and states are helping Budapest residents repair their homes. A large number of workers from Fejér County have come with many trucks and a large number of construction machinery to Budapest to participate in the construction work.

    布达佩斯恢复工作进展显著
    企业生产开始走向正轨　大力修缮住宅
    据新华社布达佩斯16日电　布达佩斯市会议执行委员会主席卡尔曼·庞格拉茨15日对新华社记者李楠介绍了布达佩斯恢复工作的进展情况。庞格拉茨说：这几天来，恢复工作的进展是很明显的。现在，首都的九十六家电影院已经开了六十家。从16日起，将有包括歌剧院在内的六个剧院开始演出。另外，已经有三分之二的公共汽车恢复行驶，电车也已经有一千八百辆行驶了。
    庞格拉茨说，市会议正在调集车辆，开始清除一个多月来堆集的碎物和垃圾。这是一个不小的工作，需要两百辆汽车工作近一个月。他说，各机关内的革命委员会已经停止了活动，过去被非法解除职务的共产党员们陆续回到岗位上来了。
    庞格拉茨随后说，市会议正在根据工农革命政府的纲领，拟制今后布达佩斯的行政工作计划。今后它的工作将更加发挥主动性，更加关心人民的需要，更加广泛地听取各方面的意见。
    庞格拉茨今年曾经参加布达佩斯市会议的一个代表团访问过中国，10月17日才回到布达佩斯。他说，他访问了北京、上海、武汉以后，中国各方面都给他留下良好的印象。他说，他衷心地感谢和祝贺北京市人民。他说，他曾经邀请北京市市长彭真明年来访问布达佩斯。他希望到那个时候，布达佩斯已经完全恢复旧观，甚至比过去更好了。
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯15日讯：布达佩斯各工业企业的生产开始走上正轨。切佩尔冶金联合厂、“兰格”、“马瓦格”、“甘兹”等巨型工厂和造船厂等都已经出产了工业成品。食品企业、轻工业和建筑工业都已经顺利开工。现在恢复全部工业生产的主要障碍依然是缺乏煤和电力。为了响应匈牙利工农革命政府的号召，矿工们每天在提高煤的开采量。
    工农革命政府和布达佩斯市会议执行委员会非常注意修缮被破坏了的房子。许多城市和州帮助布达佩斯居民修缮住宅。一大批的工人从费叶尔州开来许多货车和运来大批建筑机械到布达佩斯来参加建设工作。
