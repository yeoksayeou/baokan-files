    Improving Leadership with the Experience of the Masses

Before the winter wheat sowing, D荔 County, Shaanxi Province, discovered a pressing problem to be solved: this year, over 70% of the county's farmland was double-cropped with autumn harvests, consuming a large amount of fertilizer, which affected 40% of the wheat fields, leaving them without base fertilizer; some agricultural cooperatives, although they had fertilizer, had to plant wheat immediately after the autumn harvest, and the existing manpower and animal power could not transport the fertilizer to the fields in time.

To solve this problem, the D荔 County Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting. Someone at the meeting said, "Replace the kang, tear down the walls..." This method could no longer meet the current needs; some complained that the double-cropped area was too large, otherwise the fertilizer source would not be so scarce. No one could think of a good solution. During the discussion, the county party secretary raised a question: Had everyone consulted with the masses after discovering the problem? The cadres attending the meeting had nothing to say. In the end, the county party committee decided to hand the problem over to all cooperative members for discussion and rely on the masses to solve it.

The cadres set off to go to the countryside, raised the county party committee's requirements at the cooperative cadres' and members' meetings, and asked everyone to come up with ideas. Half of the wheat fields in the Gaochao Fourth Agricultural Cooperative did not have base fertilizer. The cadres' original idea was that a batch of chemical fertilizer had to be transferred. Unexpectedly, when soliciting opinions at the members' meeting, Cao Liwa, an old man who usually didn't talk much, stood up from the corner and said, "Young men, finding fertilizer requires everyone's effort!" He told everyone that there was an old village base that had been burned down many years ago and an old pigsty in the village. According to his experience in accumulating fertilizer, the fertilizer here was abundant and of good quality. More than 3,000 carts of black, oily fertile soil were collected from these two places alone, solving the base fertilizer needed for the entire cooperative's wheat fields.

County Party Secretary Shi Daoduo also went to the countryside. In the Gaochao Second Agricultural Cooperative, he saw the members filling ditches prone to water accumulation along the roadside or small fertilizer pits at the edge of the fields with firewood and grass; on the south bank of the Luo River, he saw many such small fertilizer pits along the way. He paid attention to this matter and visited seven agricultural cooperatives in six townships in a row, carefully discussing with the members by squatting on the edge of the fields or sitting on the kangs in the members' homes. Everyone affirmed that this method of composting fertilizer was fast and convenient for transportation. He also heard that some members in the Shangtaishantou Village area had fertilizer at home but were unwilling to take it out because the cooperative did not pay cash. In the Dengta Third Agricultural Cooperative, he found that the cooperative used cash to purchase household fertilizer from members, and the prices were also reasonably set. More than 1,500 carts were collected in two or three days, and the members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer was very high. These discoveries enlightened the county party secretary. At the same time, a minister of the county party committee came to the Da Tuanjie Agricultural Cooperative, which had the most cultivated land and households in the county. The cooperative cadres complained to him that they did not lack fertilizer, but based on the existing livestock, carts, and manpower for delivering manure, the wheat would be planted very late. The minister then went to the members to investigate. Several experienced old farmers suggested: apply two carts of human and pig manure per mu to fields far from the village, which can replace six carts of pen manure; use slightly inferior pen manure for fields not far or near, and the amount does not need to be large; the fields near the village are fertilized every year and are very fertile, so you can apply more low-quality fertilizer. They said that people who managed large crops in the past used this method, which can save a lot of labor and animal power, ensure that all wheat fields can be applied with appropriate amounts and qualities of fertilizer, and ensure overall increased production. After more than a dozen cadres and members studied this method, they handed it over to the production team for discussion, and everyone praised the method as brilliant.

A few days later, at another meeting held by the county party committee, the cadres brought back many good methods for accumulating and transporting fertilizer. After research and selection, they were concentrated into five methods and immediately notified to the entire county. Each agricultural cooperative launched a comprehensive fertilizer accumulation and delivery campaign, so that all 380,000 mu of wheat fields in the county were well fertilized before sowing.

Paying attention to summarizing the experience of the masses at any time and place is the regular work of the D荔 County Committee of the Communist Party of China. The荔chao Fourth Agricultural Cooperative is a semi-cash crop area, and they often have more cash income, but the cooperative stipulates that distribution will only be carried out in summer and autumn, and the members' labor enthusiasm is not high. With the help of the township party branch, a short-term bonus distribution method was implemented. This measure was supported by all members and also received attention from the county party committee. The county party committee immediately sent people to summarize the experience, and the county party secretary also came to investigate in person. At the cadre and member symposium, the members said that the small bonus solved the problem of everyone's pocket money difficulties, the accountant happily said that he could clear labor and settle accounts on time; the cooperative cadres were even more satisfied, the members' labor enthusiasm was increasing day by day, and there was no need to argue and urge people to go to the fields. The county party secretary helped everyone summarize the advantages of small bonuses, and also pointed out that distributing bonuses every five days also has disadvantages: the time is short, the procedures are cumbersome, and the members use the money they receive sporadically. He suggested that it is best to distribute them once a month. Subsequently, the county party committee sent the summary of the small bonus to several agricultural cooperatives for research, and also invited some directors and accountants of old cooperatives to a symposium to make this experience more complete, and this method was quickly implemented in agricultural cooperatives in the cash crop area, accounting for half of the county's agricultural cooperatives.

This year, the CPC D荔 County Committee has used typical investigation methods to help agricultural cooperatives summarize more than 40 kinds of advanced experiences in operation, management and production. As early as this year when districts and townships were merged, the county party committee sent a large number of cadres to the agricultural cooperatives, and at the same time sent ministerial-level cadres to regularly go deep into the agricultural cooperatives in segments to study and summarize the experience of the masses, and organized township cadres and cooperative cadres to summarize their own experience, so that many emerging new things could grow and spread rapidly.

Now, automatic exchanges, mutual invitations of "teachers", and sending "students" have become mass activities in agricultural cooperatives throughout D荔 County, which is also a new atmosphere formed under the advocacy of the county party committee. In the spring of this year, after the county realized advanced cooperativization, there was an urgent need to promote contracting work, contracting production, and contracting investment, but at that time, the cooperative cadres thought it was troublesome, the members were afraid of reduced production, and the leadership also lacked experience. At this time, the county party committee sent cadres to the Dongfanghong First Agricultural Cooperative, which had achieved success in promoting "three guarantees," to help the leading cadres of this cooperative summarize their experience, and concentrated more than 400 cooperative cadres from agricultural cooperatives throughout the county in this cooperative, where the cadres of this cooperative guided everyone to teach, learn, and do at the same time. Everyone felt that the county party committee's method of summarizing the experience of the masses and promoting it on the spot through mutual teaching and learning was very good. This year, D荔 County used this method to summarize and promote the experience of increasing production of five crops, including cotton and corn, and therefore, after wheat increased by 20% compared with last year, cotton, corn, oil crops, etc., also achieved bumper harvests that have not been seen for many years. Now, a scene of joy and prosperity is everywhere in the county, and more than 90% of the members in the county have increased their income compared with last year.

    用群众的经验改进领导
    新华社记者　任毓琪
    冬小麦播种前，陕西省大荔县发现一个急待解决的难题：今年全县粮田70％多复种了秋庄稼，比往年多耗费了大批肥料，影响到40％的麦田没有底肥；有些农业社虽然有肥料，但是秋收后跟着就种麦，现有的人力、畜力无法按时把肥料运到地里。
    为了解决这个问题，中共大荔县委召开了会议。有人在会上说：“换炕、拆墙……。”这套方法已经不能满足目前需要了；有人抱怨复种面积过大，不然肥源不会如此缺乏。大家都想不出解决问题的好办法。在讨论中，县委书记提出了一个疑问：大家发现难题以后是否和群众商量过？参加会议的干部无话可答。最后，县委决定把问题交给全县社员讨论，依靠群众解决。
    干部们出发下乡了，在社干部、社员会上提出县委的要求，请大家出主意。高潮第四农业社半数麦田没有底肥，干部们原来的意见是非调来一批化学肥料不可。想不到这次在社员会上征求意见时，从角落里站起来一位平日不大讲话的曹立娃老汉，他说：“小伙子们，找肥源要大家出力呢！”他告诉大家村中有一座多年以前烧毁的老村底和有一个旧猪圈，根据他积肥的经验，这里的肥料又多又好。光从这两个地方就搜集到三千多车黑油油的沃土，解决了全社麦田需用的基肥。
    县委书记师道铎也下乡了，他在高潮第二农业社，见到社员们把柴草填在路边容易积水的坑洼里或地头的小沤肥坑中；在洛河南岸，他一路上看见不少这类小型沤肥坑。他注意了这件事，便一连访问了六个乡的七个农业社，和社员们蹲在地边、坐在社员家炕头上和社员仔细商量，大家都肯定这种沤肥方法时间快，运送又便利。他还听到上太山头村一带有些社员家里有肥料，因为社里不给现钱，不愿拿出来。在灯塔第三农业社他发现社里用现金收购社员的家庭肥料，价格规定的也合理，两三天内就收集了一千五百多车，社员积肥热情很高。这些发现，使县委书记心中亮堂了。同时，县委的一位部长来到全县耕地和户数最多的大团结农业社。合作社干部们向他诉苦说：肥料不缺，但是按现有的牲口、大车和人手送粪，小麦要很迟才能种下。这位部长便到社员中去调查，有几位经验丰富的老农提出建议：离村远的地一亩上两车人粪、猪粪，能顶六车圈肥；不远不近的地用稍差些的圈肥，量也不用多；近地年年上粪、很肥壮，可以多上些质量差的肥料。他们说以前经营大庄稼的人就用过这种办法，能节省大量劳力和畜力，保证全部麦田都能施上适当数量和质量的肥料，确保全面增产。十几位干部、社员研究了这个办法以后，又把这个办法交给生产队讨论，大家都惊喜地赞扬办法高明。
    几天以后，在又一次县委召开的会议上，干部们带回来许多积肥、送粪的好办法，经过研究、取舍，集中成为五个办法，并立刻通报全县，各农业社全面掀起积肥送肥运动，使全县三十八万亩麦田在播种前都施好底肥。
    随时随地注意总结群众经验已是中共大荔县委的经常工作。荔潮第四农业社是半经济作物区，他们经常收入中现钱比较多，但是这个社却规定要到夏秋两季才进行分配，社员劳动积极性不高。经过乡的中共支部的帮助，实行短期分红的办法，这个措施获得全体社员拥护，同时也受到县委的重视。县委马上派人来总结经验，县委书记也亲自来调查，在干部、社员座谈会上，社员说小分红解决了大家零用钱的困难，会计高兴地说他能按时清工结账了；社干部更满意，社员劳动热情日益高涨，再不用争吵催人下地。县委书记帮助大家总结了小分红的优点，同时也指出五天分一次红也有缺点：时间短、手续繁琐、社员零星拿到钱都零碎用掉。他建议最好一个月分一次。随后，县委把小分红的总结发交几个农业社研究，还请来一些老社的主任和会计来座谈，使这个经验更加完善，很快地在占全县农业社半数的经济作物区的农业社里，实行了这个办法。
    今年，中共大荔县委用典型调查方法帮助农业社总结的经营管理和生产方面的先进经验已有四十多种。早在今年撤区并乡时，县委就把大批干部派到农业社里，同时派出了部长一级干部经常分片深入农业社，研究总结群众经验，并且组织乡干部和社干部自己动手总结经验，使许多萌芽的新事物得到迅速成长和传播。
    现在大荔县各农业社自动往来、互请“教员”、派“留学生”，已成为群众性活动，这也是在县委倡导下形成的新风气。今年春天，全县实现高级合作化后迫切需要推行包工、包产、包投资，但当时社干部嫌麻烦、社员怕减产，领导上也缺乏经验。这时，县委派干部到推行“三包”有成绩的东方红第一农业社，帮助这个社的领导干部总结了经验，把全县农业社的四百多名社干部集中到这个社来，由这个社的干部指导大家边教、边学、边做。大家都感到县委这样总结群众经验、在现场由群众互教互学推广的办法很好。大荔县今年就是用这种方法，总结推广了棉花、玉米等五种作物的增产经验，因而继小麦比去年增产两成之后，棉花、玉米、油料等又获得多年未有的大丰收。现在这个县到处呈现喜气盈盈的景象，全县90％以上的社员都比去年增加了收入。
