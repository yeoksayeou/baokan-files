The Deputy Governor, a Dong Singer

— "A Trip to Southeastern Guizhou" Part 4

　　Jian Xian'ai

　　Whenever singing was mentioned, Liang Wanggui would become animated. He said in a cheerful tone:

　　"Since the Party promoted me to be the county head, I haven't been singing as much. But when I go down to the villages, I still sing. To be honest with you, in our countryside, as soon as I start singing, the masses flock like bees; men and women, old and young, all love to sing, and even sleepiness disappears. We always sing first, then hold meetings. I still remember when we were carrying out land reform in the Xishui District, we used Dong songs to mobilize the masses and publicize policies. It was really effective. Singing can really bring you close to the people..."

　　A Miao representative next to us chimed in, "Director Liang, why don't you tell the provincial representatives some of your model deeds?"

　　"What model deeds do I have!" Liang Wanggui almost laughed out loud, shaking his head and saying, "It's just that I understand Han, Miao, and Dong languages, and I can explain policies to the masses in detail, speaking to each ethnic group in their own language. We work and live with the people, so naturally our relationship gets better. The work here mainly relies on the leadership of the Party and the help of cadres from other places and Han cadres; without them, we would be helpless."

　　I took the opportunity to ask him, "In your opinion, what shortcomings are there in our work in ethnic minority areas regarding the agricultural collectivization movement?"

　　Liang Wanggui didn't hesitate at all, saying, "Collectivization is something we are doing voluntarily. However, some of our cadres don't pay enough attention to the characteristics of the ethnic groups, and the care is not sufficient. For example, some agricultural production cooperatives planted all the land with grain, including cotton land, chili land, and indigo land, which is wrong. Some even forced farmers to bring their family oxen and old oxen into the cooperative. Also, the price of the forest trees was converted too low. You see, such a sudden change in the living habits of ethnic minorities will naturally make some farmers feel uncomfortable. This makes the elderly and women have opinions. Can we blame them for being backward? Why are some of our cadres unwilling to consult with the masses more when something happens?"

　　I quickly said, "That's right, that's right! Your opinions are very correct. I believe the Party and the government will immediately conduct inspections and corrections, and will not allow this to continue."

　　During our days in Zhenyuan, the preparatory committee of the autonomous prefecture was very busy, but Liang Wanggui sometimes took the time after dinner to come to the wisteria trellis in our courtyard to chat. We learned a lot about the Dong ethnic group from him.

　　During the congress discussions, after he finished speaking, he sang a very moving Dong song, his voice as smooth and free as the female singers of the Miao and Dong ethnic groups.

　　This young man, educated and cultivated by the Party, has always been loved by the broad masses. On the last day of the congress, he was honorably elected as the Deputy Governor of the Southeastern Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture.

　　On the morning of our departure, the governors and representatives came to see us off. Liang Wanggui brought me the translated manuscript of the Dong song he sang that day. I like it very much. I feel that it is not just a song, but a beautiful poem expressing heartfelt love and gratitude to the Party and Chairman Mao. I have transcribed it here:

　　"Brothers and sisters from sixteen counties come to congratulate,

　　One million eight hundred thousand people are rejoicing today;

　　We are united closely like a big family,

　　Holding hands to establish the autonomous prefecture.

　　"Like the winter sun shining on our heads,

　　The warm wind blows throughout our homeland,

　　Chairman Mao's representatives from Beijing have come,

　　Kindness like a clear spring splashing on the carp.

　　"Not afraid of the green mountains being cut down,

　　When spring comes, they will sprout and grow;

　　Not afraid of ice and snow covering the mountains and rivers,

　　Part the clouds and the sun will appear."

    侗族歌手副州长
    ——“黔东南行”之四
    蹇先艾
    一谈到唱歌，梁旺贵就眉飞色舞起来了，他带着愉快的口吻说：
  “自从党提拔我当了县长以后，歌就比较唱得少了。不过下乡去，我还是一样地唱。不瞒你们说，在我们乡下，只要一唱歌，群众一窠蜂都来了，男女老少都喜歌，瞌睡也跑得不见了。我们总是先唱歌，后开会。我还记得那两年在熙山区搞土地改革的时候，我们通过唱侗歌来发动群众，宣传政策，效力真大，唱歌就是可以跟群众打成一片。……”
    我们旁边一个苗族女代表也来插嘴道：“梁主任，把你的模范事迹讲点给省代表听听，好不好？”
    “我哪里有什么模范事迹啊！”梁旺贵差点没有笑出声来，摇了摇头说：“不过是我懂得汉话、苗话、侗话，给群众解释政策详细一点，对什么族，就说什么话。我们跟群众一起工作，一起生活，关系自然就搞得更好一些。这里搞工作，主要还是靠党的领导，外来干部同汉族干部的帮助；没有这些，我们是毫无办法的。”
    我就顺便问他：“你看，我们在兄弟民族地区搞农业合作化运动，工作上有些什么缺点呢？”
    梁旺贵一点也不迟疑地说：“合作化是我们自觉自愿搞起来的。不过我们有些干部还不大注意民族的特点，照顾得是不够的。打比说，棉花土、辣椒土、蓝靛土，有的农业生产合作社就把它们一齐都种了粮食，这就不对了。有的连保家牛、养老牛都强迫农民牵去入社；还有，把林木的价钱也折合得太低了。你想，少数民族的生活习惯，突如其来起了这么一种变化，有些农民自然就会觉得不惯了。弄得老年人同妇女们都有意见，我们能够怪他们落后吗？为什么我们有些干部，有事就不肯多跟群众商量一下呢？”
    我连忙说：“有理，有理！你的意见提得很对。我相信党同政府一定马上就进行检查、纠正，不会听任这样下去的。”
    我们留在镇远的日子里，州筹委会的工作是太繁忙了，但是在晚饭后，梁旺贵有时也抽空到我们住的院子里的藤萝架下来谈天；我们向他学习了不少关于侗族的知识。
    大会讨论的时候，他发完了言以后，还唱了一首很动人的侗歌，歌喉宛转自如，同苗族、侗族那些女歌手比起来，是不相上下的。
    这位被党教育、培养出来的青年，一向都受到广大群众的爱戴，在大会最后的一天，他光荣地当选为黔东南苗族侗族自治州的副州长。
    我们临走的那天早上，州长们和代表们都来给我们送行，梁旺贵把那天唱的那首侗歌的译稿带来给我了。我很喜欢它，我觉得不但是一首歌，而且应该说是一个对党和毛主席流露着衷心的热爱和感激的美丽的诗篇。我把它照录在这里：
    “十六个县各族兄弟姊妹来贺喜，
    一百八十万人今天都欢天喜地；
    我们亲密团结得好像大家庭，
    手拉着手儿把自治州建立起
    “像冬天的太阳晒在我们的头上，
    温暖的风吹遍了我们的家乡，
    北京毛主席的代表来啦，
    恩情像清泉泼到鲤鱼身上。
    “不怕青山遭过砍伐，
    春天来到它就会发芽生长；
    不怕冰雪盖住山川，
    拨开云雾就会出现太阳。”
                          （续完）
