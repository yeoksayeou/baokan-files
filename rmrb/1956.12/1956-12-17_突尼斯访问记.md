    A Visit to Tunisia

    (VII) Changes in the Tunisian National Library

    On the eve of the Islamic New Year, we visited the Tunisian National Library. On this day, Tunisians were dressed in their national holiday attire, wearing small red felt hats and loose, white, sleeveless gowns. Girls wore white tops and red skirts. Families feasted with relatives and friends, eating their national holiday meal, "Couscous" (a type of rice made with chicken and wheat).

    As we drove to the library, the fragrance of incense from the mosques wafted towards us, giving us a sense of being in a fairyland. The Tunisian National Library is located in the heart of the Arab district of Tunis. Since it was the eve of the New Year, only the director remained at the library to greet us, with no other readers or staff present.

    The Tunisian National Library was established in 1883, but the history of this library does not represent the long history of libraries in Tunisia. As early as 800 BC, Tunisia already had its first library, one of the oldest in the world. Unfortunately, this library was burned down by invading Roman armies in 146 BC.

    The current Tunisian National Library is not large, with a collection of 500,000 books in seventy-two languages. Its reading room can accommodate 5,000 readers. However, its history demonstrates the enormous changes that occurred in Tunisia before and after independence.

    Before independence, this library was a tool for French colonialists to carry out cultural aggression against Tunisia. Everything in the library was Frenchified. The director was French, and thirty of the thirty-five staff members were also French. Although the library contained a large number of classical Arabic books, Tunisian readers were only allowed to read French books. The Arabic books were covered in a thick layer of dust. French colonialists attempted to bury the long-standing Tunisian culture in this way. In order to restrict Tunisians from coming to the library to read, they specially set up a dirty, small, and dark reading room for Tunisians. The French director even slandered Tunisians as thieves.

    After independence, that is, only a few months ago, after the Tunisian people took back the library from the French colonialists, the situation changed greatly. The number of readers in the library has more than doubled compared to before independence. Thirty of the thirty-five staff members have been replaced by Arabs. In the past, all the book cards were in French, but now they are being changed to Arabic. Arabic books that had been buried in dust for decades have been placed in the most prominent positions. The director has also been replaced by a Tunisian.

    As we were about to leave the library, the director repeatedly expressed his hope to establish contact with Chinese libraries. He said, "The Tunisian people all hope to read Chinese books. They not only want to study Tunisia and Africa, but also want to study Asia and China, to study Confucius and Mencius, and to study the experiences of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggles and economic construction."

    突尼斯访问记

    （七）突尼斯国立图书馆的变迁
    伊斯兰历元旦的前夕，我们参观突尼斯国立图书馆。这一天，突尼斯人都穿上他们民族的节日盛装，头戴红色小毡帽，身穿白色无袖而肥大的长衫，姑娘们都穿上白衣红裙。家家宴请亲友，吃他们民族的节日盛餐“古斯古斯”（一种用鸡肉和小麦作的饭）。
    当我们乘车去图书馆的时候，清真寺的香烟迎面扑来，使人有如入仙境之感。突尼斯国立图书馆，位于突尼斯市阿拉伯区的中心。由于是元旦前夕，图书馆里除馆长为了迎接我们而留在那里外，没有读者和职员。
    突尼斯国立图书馆建立于1883年，但这座图书馆的历史并不能代表历史悠久的突尼斯的图书馆事业。突尼斯远在公元前八百年，就已经有了自己的第一座图书馆，这是世界上最古老的图书馆之一，可惜这座图书馆在公元前146年被入侵的罗马军队焚毁了。
    现在的突尼斯国立图书馆的规模并不大，共藏书五十万册，包括七十二种语言，它的阅览室可容五千读者。但是它的历史却表现出了突尼斯独立前后的巨大变化。
    独立前，这座图书馆是法国殖民主义者向突尼斯进行文化侵略的工具。图书馆的一切都法国化了，馆长是法国人，三十五个职员中有三十个也是法国人，图书馆里虽存着大量的阿拉伯文的古典书籍，但突尼斯读者却只准读法文书，阿拉伯文书籍上盖上了一层厚厚的尘土，法国殖民主义者企图借此来埋葬悠久的突尼斯文化。法国人为了限制突尼斯人到图书馆来读书，专为突尼斯人设立了一间肮脏不堪的又小又暗的阅览室。法国馆长甚至还污蔑突尼斯人是小偷。
    独立后，也就是说仅仅几月前，突尼斯人民从法国殖民者手中收回了这座图书馆之后，情况发生了很大的变化，图书馆的读者比独立前增加了一倍多，三十五个职员中有三十个换了阿拉伯人，过去的图书卡片全部是法文的，现正在改成阿拉伯文，几十年来被埋在灰尘里的阿拉伯文书籍被放到了最显著的位置。馆长也换成了突尼斯人。
    当我们要离开图书馆的时候，馆长再三表示希望和中国图书馆建立联系，他说：“突尼斯人民都希望读到中国的书籍，他们不仅要求研究突尼斯和非洲，而且要求研究亚洲和中国，研究孔子和孟子，研究中国人民革命斗争和经济建设的经验。”　（未完）
