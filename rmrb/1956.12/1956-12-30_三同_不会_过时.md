Behind-the-Scenes Notes

    "Three Together" Will Not Be "Outdated"
    Lower-level cadres living with farmers and participating in production alongside them – viewed in isolation, this kind of activity doesn't seem to create significant labor results. Consequently, some people doubt the necessity of this approach, believing that "three together" (eating, living, and laboring together with farmers) is "outdated."
    However, the problem is that no matter can be viewed in isolation. To truly understand what the farmers are thinking, what joys and sorrows they experience in life, and to grasp their valuable production experiences, is something that those who "go to the countryside by bicycle in the morning and return to the county town for rest in the evening" can never accomplish, let alone those who stay in the office all year round.
    In Ningxiang County, many cadres "took off their woolen uniforms and leather shoes and put on cloth clothes again to work in the countryside," and the county party secretary also collected manure with the commune members in the snow. The significance of these actions is far more than just frugality and enduring hardship; more importantly, their hearts are closer to the hearts of the masses, and the masses trust them even more.

### “三同”不会“过时”

    “三同”不会“过时”
    下乡干部同农民住在一起，同农民一起参加生产，这种事情，孤立起来看，似乎是不会创造出很大劳动成果来的。于是，有些人怀疑这种做法的必要性，认为“三同”（与农民同吃同住同劳动）是“过时”的了。
    可是，问题就在于，对任何事情都不能孤立起来看。要真切地了解农民群众在想些什么，生活中有些什么欢乐和苦痛，要懂得农民群众的宝贵的生产经验，就决不是“早上骑自行车下乡，晚上又骑自行车回县城休息”的人可以做到的，更不要说终年呆在办公室里的人了。
    宁乡县很多干部“脱下呢制服和皮鞋，重新穿上布衣服下乡工作”，县委书记也同社员一道冒雪积肥，这些事情的意义，决不止于俭朴和吃苦；更重要的是他们的心同群众的心又靠近了，群众也更信任他们了。
