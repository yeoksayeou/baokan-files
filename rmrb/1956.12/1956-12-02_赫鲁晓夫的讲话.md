　　Khrushchev's Speech
    The Chinese Communist Party utilizes the experience of the Soviet Union and the international workers' movement, creatively applying it based on its own national conditions, rather than mechanically copying it. They are Marxists-Leninists, consistently implementing the principles of internationalism. Dear comrades, friends!

    Please allow me to say a few words. We are very pleased with the visit of the delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee to our country. We are also very happy to meet our dear guests at the reception held at the Embassy of the People's Republic of China to celebrate the visit of these two delegations to the Soviet Union.

    The Soviet people praise the achievements of the Chinese people, and praise the victories achieved by the glorious fraternal Chinese Communist Party in leading the Chinese people to carry out socialist construction victoriously. The experience of socialist construction in China is valuable and noteworthy.

    The delegation of the National People's Congress of China is composed of representatives from all social strata in China. Among this delegation are Communist Party members, representatives of other parties and social organizations in China, representatives of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and representatives of intellectuals. There are also prominent figures from the Kuomintang who held important positions under Chiang Kai-shek's rule in your delegation. The members of your delegation are diverse, but they are completely united in their desire to build a new China.

    I am not a young man anymore, and I myself used to work in capitalist enterprises. I participated in strikes and negotiated with capitalists as a member of workers' delegations. But at that time, we did not sit side by side with them, but face to face, and our interests were irreconcilable. Today, however, we have had friendly talks with your two delegations, and your delegation includes representatives of capitalists from Chinese industrial and commercial circles. We discussed with them common issues of concern to us and our Chinese friends: how we and China should better build a new life, and how we can mutually utilize the experience of the Soviet people and the experience of the Chinese people, the experience of our Communist Party and the experience of the Chinese Communist Party.

    The Chinese revolution developed in a unique form, with the patriotic national bourgeoisie participating alongside workers, peasants, and intellectuals in building a new society. Industrial and commercial circles have a good understanding of the people's government. Under the conditions of the People's Republic of China, people in industrial and commercial circles have made contributions to the cause of the whole people.

    Our revolution took place in a different situation. Our industrialists and businessmen were not like that, because most of them were vehemently opposed to the socialist revolution and the people. China experienced a long period of national war and civil war, during which the national bourgeoisie united with the working people to fight against foreign imperialists and their reactionary agents in China.

    The Chinese people crushed internal and external enemies, won and consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and guaranteed China's development on a socialist basis. That is the actual situation. We are happy about this and congratulate the historical achievements of great China, because these achievements reflect the brilliance, flexibility, and deep understanding of China's special conditions shown by the fraternal Chinese Communist Party.

    Now everyone can see how effectively the Chinese comrades are solving the extremely complex revolutionary task of transforming agriculture on the basis of cooperation. This is a particularly significant victory for the Chinese people.

    In the process of the Chinese revolution, the Chinese Communist Party utilized the rich experience of the great October Socialist Revolution, the experience of the Soviet Communist Party, and the experience of all fraternal communist and workers' parties. However, the Chinese Communists did not mechanically apply this experience to their own country. They creatively applied this experience based on China's own national conditions, and made good use of this experience to serve the revolution and the Chinese people. The Chinese Communist Party, as a truly revolutionary working-class party, implements a skillful policy: this policy takes into account the national and social conditions of the country, unites the people, unites the various ethnic groups of China, in order to move towards socialism as quickly as possible.

    The Chinese comrades have accomplished a great cause that can serve as an example for many countries. They are not proud of this, and they tirelessly study the beneficial experiences of other countries, large and small, showing particular modesty, which is something to be learned from them.

    The Chinese comrades adopt methods of building socialism that are in line with their own national conditions. At the same time, they invariably say that they are Marxists-Leninists, and that they have adopted and are adopting the experience of the Soviet Communist Party. It should be known that they have made great contributions to the study of Marxist-Leninist theory and to the practice of revolutionary struggle and socialist construction. The Chinese comrades say: We have close and inseparable friendship with the Soviet Union, we have close friendship with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and with other communist and workers' parties, and we consistently use the experience of our Soviet friends and the experience of the entire international workers' movement. This shows that the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to the international solidarity of the working people, the fraternal solidarity of communist and workers' parties, and consistently implements the principles of proletarian internationalism.

    Much can be said about the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people, and the Chinese revolution, but not everything can be said in a short speech.

    Let me congratulate the delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, congratulate the People's Republic of China on its achievements in socialist construction, congratulate the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples, congratulate the Marxist-Leninist leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, congratulate the heroic Chinese people, congratulate the leaders and leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, and wish Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Dehuai, Peng Zhen, and other comrades who have experienced the glorious revolutionary struggle and are leading their people with confidence on the road to socialism, good health.

　　赫鲁晓夫的讲话
    中国共产党运用苏联和国际工人运动的经验，是根据本国条件创造性的运用，而不是机械地搬用。他们是马克思列宁主义者，始终如一地执行着国际主义的原则。亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    请容许我讲几句话。我们对中国全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团访问我国感到非常高兴。我们也很高兴在中华人民共和国大使馆为这两个代表团访问苏联而举行的招待会上会见我们亲爱的客人。
    苏联人赞扬中国人民所获得的成就，赞扬领导中国人民胜利进行社会主义建设的光荣的兄弟中国共产党所取得的胜利。中国的社会主义建设的经验是宝贵而引人注意的经验。
    中国全国人民代表大会代表团是由中国各个社会阶层的代表组成的。这个代表团中有共产党员、中国其他党派和社会团体的代表、中国工商联的人士和知识分子的代表。代表团中还有过去在蒋介石统治下担任要职的国民党著名人物。你们代表团的成员是各式各样的，但是，在建设新中国的愿望上是完全一致的。
    我已经不是一个年轻的人了，我自己过去也曾经在资本主义的企业中工作过。我参加过罢工，作为工人代表团的团员同资本家进行过谈判。但是，当时我们同他们并不是并排坐在一起的，而是彼此面对面，我们的利益是不可调和的。而今天，我们同你们的两个代表团进行了友好的谈话，你们的代表团中有中国工商界的资本家代表。我们同他们讨论了我们和我们中国朋友所关心的共同问题：我们和中国应该怎样更好地建设新生活，如何互相利用苏联人民的经验和中国人民的经验、我们共产党和中国共产党的经验。
    中国的革命是以独特的形式发展的，爱国的民族资产阶级同工人、农民和知识分子一起参加建设新社会。工商界同人民政权彼此有很好的了解。在中华人民共和国的条件下，工商界人士在全民事业中作出了贡献。
    我们的革命是在另一种情况下进行的。我们的工商业家却不是那样，因为他们大多数都是猖狂反对社会主义革命、反对人民的。中国经历了长期的民族战争和国内战争，在战争过程中，民族资产阶级同劳动人民结合在一起，为反对外国帝国主义者和他们在中国的反动代理人而斗争。
    中国人民粉碎了内外敌人，争取到并且巩固了人民民主专政，保证了中国在社会主义基础上的发展。实际情况就是如此。我们对这件事感到高兴，并且祝贺伟大的中国的历史成就，因为在这些成就中反映了兄弟中国共产党所表现出来的英明、灵活和对中国特殊条件的深刻理解。
    现在大家都看到，中国同志们怎样有效地解决着在合作化的基础上改造农业的极其复杂的革命任务。这是中国人民特别重大的胜利。
    在中国革命的过程中，中国共产党运用了伟大的十月社会主义革命的丰富经验、苏联共产党以及所有兄弟共产党和工人党的经验。但是，中国共产党人并没有把这种经验机械地搬用于本国，他们根据中国的本国条件创造性地运用了这种经验，很好地利用这种经验为革命、为中国人民服务。中国共产党作为真正革命的工人阶级政党，执行着一种巧妙的政策：这种政策考虑到本国的民族条件和社会条件，把人们联合起来，把中国各族人民团结在一起，以便尽速地向社会主义前进。
    中国同志完成了可以作为许多国家的榜样的伟大事业，他们并不以此自傲，他们不倦地钻研其他大小国家的有益经验，表现得特别谦虚，这一点是可以向他们学习的。
    中国同志采用符合本国情况的建设社会主义的方法，同时他们始终不变地说，他们是马克思列宁主义者，他们过去和现在都采用苏联共产党的经验。要知道他们对马克思列宁主义理论的研究，对革命斗争和社会主义建设的实践作出了巨大的贡献。中国同志说：我们同苏联有亲密无间的友谊，我们同苏联共产党、同其他国家共产党和工人党亲睦友好，我们一贯运用苏联朋友的经验、整个国际工人运动的经验。这说明，中国共产党非常重视劳动人民的国际团结、共产党和工人党的兄弟团结，并且始终如一地执行着无产阶级国际主义的原则。
    关于中国共产党、中国人民和中国革命可以说很多，但是在短短的讲话中不能全都说到。
    让我祝贺中国全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团，祝贺中华人民共和国在社会主义建设中的成就，祝贺苏中两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊，祝贺中国共产党的马克思列宁主义的领导，祝贺英勇的中国人民，祝贺中国共产党的领袖和领导者们，祝毛泽东同志、刘少奇同志、周恩来同志、朱德同志、陈云同志、邓小平同志、彭德怀同志、彭真同志和经历了光荣的革命的斗争道路、满怀信心地领导本国人民走社会主义道路的其他同志们健康。
