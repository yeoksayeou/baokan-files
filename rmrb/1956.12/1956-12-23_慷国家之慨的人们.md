To the Editor:

There is a prevailing trend in Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province, during the People's Congress meetings and other meetings convened by the People's Committee: each meeting incurs a significant expense for receptions, not only for the delegates, non-voting delegates, and staff attending the meeting, but also for inviting unnecessary guests. In particular, the meeting staff, in addition to receiving their own meal tickets and movie tickets, also obtain extra meal tickets and movie tickets to indulge in private hospitality. For example, during the demobilized soldiers' representative meeting held in late November, a meeting staff member privately gifted five meal tickets and ten movie tickets to cadres in the Jiamusi City People's Committee Office. The situation was even more serious during the People's Congress meeting held in early November, with all personnel of the Jiamusi City People's Committee Office, from leading cadres to janitorial staff, participating in the banquets. Such phenomena have become common practice in the Jiamusi City People's Committee.

The long-term existence of this situation in the city's leading organs has also influenced other departments in the city. For example, when Jiamusi City convened a meeting of small vendors in early December, the City Commercial Bureau alone obtained more than ten theater tickets. The city's leading cadres are aware of these situations but never intervene. These may seem like minor issues, but if a city, a province, or the entire country engages in this behavior, it will result in a massive waste of state funds. The Jiamusi City People's Committee should take measures to prevent this phenomenon from continuing.

    慷国家之慨的人们编辑同志：
    黑龙江省佳木斯市人民委员会召开人民代表大会会议和其他会议时有这样一种风气：每次开会都要付出一笔很大的招待费，不仅要招待参加会议的代表、列席代表和工作人员，还要邀请一些不必要的陪客。特别是大会工作人员除了个人得一份餐票和影戏票外，还要多捞几张餐票和影剧票，再来一个私人招待。如11月下旬召开的转业军人代表会议，一个大会工作人员就私自送给市人民委员会办公室的干部餐票五张、影剧票十张。在11月上旬召开的市人民代表大会会议，情况更为严重，佳木斯市人民委员会办公室上至领导干部，下至勤杂人员全部参加会餐。诸如此类现象在佳木斯市人民委员会已经成为惯例。
    市的领导机关长期存在这种情况，因而也影响到市的其他部门。如佳木斯市12月上旬召开小商小贩代表会议时，仅市商业局即获得十多张戏票。这些情况，市的领导干部是知道的，但从来不加过问。这些看起来是小事，但一个市、一个省或全国各地都这样做，就会大量浪费国家资金。佳木斯市人民委员会应采取措施杜绝这种现象继续发生。　佳木斯市计划委员会
