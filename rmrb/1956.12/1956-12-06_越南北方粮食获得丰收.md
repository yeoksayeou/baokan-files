Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 5th: The autumn harvest in Northern Vietnam is nearing completion, with a bumper crop on 1.4 million hectares of land.

According to statistics from relevant departments of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in the plains areas, excluding waterlogged and saline-alkali land which account for about 2% of the cultivated area, the average yield per hectare reached 2,000 kilograms, exceeding the original plan by 200 kilograms, and increasing by 300 kilograms compared to last year's autumn harvest. In areas such as the suburbs of Hanoi and Haiphong, the yield reached 3,000 kilograms per hectare. In some areas of the Red River Left Bank Region and the Fourth Interzone, yields exceeded 5,000 kilograms due to the adoption of close planting methods and the application of phosphate fertilizer. In Jian'an Province, where crops are difficult to grow due to soil alkalization, the yield reached more than 1,800 kilograms per hectare.

The harvest in mountainous areas is also equally good.

The bumper harvest of early rice and autumn rice this year has brought the total rice output in Northern Vietnam to over 4 million tons, an increase of more than 500,000 tons compared to last year. This enables Northern Vietnam not only to overcome the historical grain shortage, but also to have a surplus for export.

According to agricultural and forestry officials, with the early rice and autumn rice harvests combined, the average per capita grain ration will increase from over 270 kilograms last year to over 300 kilograms this year. Due to the bumper harvest of early rice and autumn rice, the living standards of farmers in various regions will be further improved.

In order to prevent the price of grain from falling after the autumn rice harvest, harming the interests of farmers, the government has announced the purchase price for autumn rice, instructed commercial departments to carry out procurement in a planned and timely manner, and decided to reduce the price of rice in Hanoi and other regions.

　　越南北方粮食获得丰收
    据新华社河内5日电　越南北方各地秋收即将完毕，一百四十万公顷的土地获得了丰收。
    据越南民主共和国政府有关部门统计，在平原地区，除了约占耕地面积2％的积水地和盐碱地之外，每公顷土地的收获量平均达到二千公斤，超过原计划二百公斤，比去年秋收的收获量增加了三百公斤。像河内、海防郊区等地区，每公顷土地收到三千公斤。红河左岸区和第四联区个别地区，由于采用密植办法和施用磷肥，使得产量达到五千公斤以上。由于土地碱化作物不易生长的建安省，每公顷收到一千八百多公斤。
    山地的收成也同样的好。
    今年早稻和秋稻的丰收，使越南北方今年稻米的总产量超过了四百万吨，比去年增加五十多万吨。这使越南北部不仅可以克服历史上的缺粮现象，而且还可以有余粮出口。
    据农林部人士说，把今年的早稻和秋稻算在一起，每人每年平均得到粮食将由去年的二百七十余公斤增加到三百余公斤。由于早稻和秋稻丰收，各地农民的生活将进一步改善。
    为了避免秋稻登场后谷价降低，损害农民的利益，政府已经发布了收购秋稻的价格，责成商业部门有计划地和及时地进行收购，同时决定降低河内和各地的米价。
