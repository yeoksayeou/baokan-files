    Conserve Electricity in Production
  　Zheng Xicai
    Currently, twenty-three regions across the country are experiencing electricity shortages, which has affected the normal production of some factories and mines. Therefore, conserving electricity is a very important task. Among electricity conservation efforts, conserving electricity in production is particularly important, as production electricity accounts for about 80% of total power generation.
    Over the past few years, our factories and mining enterprises have learned and created many advanced experiences in saving electricity. Promoting these advanced experiences is undoubtedly of practical significance for conserving electricity in production. Unfortunately, due to various ideological resistances among some enterprise leaders, this work has not been done well.
    Some enterprise leaders only complain about the power generation departments' insufficient power supply, believing that electricity conservation in production has reached its peak, and therefore no longer actively explore the potential for electricity conservation. This understanding does not conform to the actual situation. On the contrary, it should be said that with the continuous improvement of workers' technical level and the adjustment of production equipment, the possibility of saving electricity in production is increasing. For example, due to the improvement of workers' technical level, the Jinan Flour Mill's unit power consumption for products this year decreased by 23.3% compared to last year. The Nantong Tianshenggang Power Plant assisted users in adjusting production equipment, saving the country 870,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity in four and a half months. If we only see the past achievements in saving electricity in production, thinking that the potential has been almost exhausted, and fail to see the growth of various positive factors in saving electricity in production, we will become prisoners of conservative thinking.
    Another idea that neglects electricity conservation in production is that electricity accounts for a small proportion of production costs, and saving electricity does not bring much "benefit" to the unit, so they do not save even when they can. Many factories and mines have not yet achieved stopping the machine and cutting the power, or they excessively accelerate the speed of machines, causing electricity to be consumed in non-productive friction and heat loss. Obviously, these ideas and practices are incorrect. Saving one kilowatt-hour of electricity can produce thirty feet of white fine cloth, produce one more bag of flour, or refine one kilogram of high-quality steel. Is this really not much "benefit"! Saving one cent of electricity is equivalent to increasing one cent of investment, one cent of strength, and one cent of guarantee for the country's economic construction; wasting one kilowatt-hour of electricity wastes one cent of investment and reduces one cent of strength for the country's economic construction. In a word, saving electricity yourself is supporting others, and this is by no means a dispensable thing.
    Saving electricity, like other saving efforts, is a long-term, meticulous, and complex task. To do a good job in saving electricity in production, we must have a set of methods suitable for the characteristics of electricity. Because electricity is something that cannot be touched by hand or seen with the eye, and many factories and mines currently have fewer installed electricity meters, the larger the collective electricity consumption unit, the more difficult it is to see the achievements of individual savings. Therefore, in addition to eliminating ideological obstacles and raising awareness of electricity conservation, and establishing a culture of electricity conservation, enterprise departments should also formulate a set of reward systems and include electricity conservation as one of the contents of production inspections. Only in this way can we use every kilowatt-hour of electricity in the most economical and rational way.

### 节约生产用电

    节约生产用电
  　郑喜财
    目前，全国有二十三个地区缺电，一些厂矿的正常生产已受到影响，因此节约用电是一项十分重要的工作。在节约用电中，节约生产用电尤其重要，因为生产用电约占全部发电量的80％。
    几年来，我们的厂矿企业学习和创造了许多节约电力的先进经验，推广这些先进经验，对节约生产用电，无疑是有现实意义的。可惜由于一部分企业领导人员存在着种种思想抵触，这个工作做得并不好。
    有些企业的领导干部只是埋怨发电部门供电不足，认为生产用电已经达到节约的顶点，因而不再积极地挖掘节约电力的潜力。这种认识是不符合实际情况的。相反，应该说随着工人技术水平的不断提高和生产设备的调整，在生产中节约电力的可能性是愈来愈大了。例如济南面粉厂由于工人的技术水平提高了，今年产品的单位耗电量就比去年下降了23.3％。南通天生港电厂协助用户调整了生产设备，四个半月就为国家节约了电力八十七万度。如果我们只看到过去在节约生产用电方面的成绩，以为潜力已经挖得差不多了，而看不见节约生产用电的各种积极因素的增长，我们就作了保守思想的俘虏。
    不注意生产中节约用电的另一种想法，是电力在生产成本中占的比重较小，节约电力对本单位的“油水不大”，因而本来能节约的也不节约了。许多厂矿在生产中还没有做到停机停电，或者无限制的加快机器转速，使电力消耗于非生产性的摩擦和热耗上。显然，这种想法和作法都是不对的。节约一度电力就可以多织出三十尺白细布，多生产出一袋面粉，多炼出一公斤优质钢。难道这是“油水不大”吗！节约一分电力，就等于给国家经济建设增加了一分投资，一分力量，一分保证；浪费一度电力就给国家经济建设浪费了一分投资，减少了一分力量。一句话，自己节约了电力就是支援了别人，这绝不是可有可无的事情。
    节约电力同其它各项节约工作一样，是一个长期的、细致的、复杂的工作。要把生产中节约电力的工作做好，就要有适合电力特性的一套方法。因为电是用手拿不着，用眼看不见的东西，而且目前许多厂矿安装的电表较少，集体用电的单位越大越不容易看到个人节约的成绩。因此，企业部门除了在思想上扫除障碍提高节约用电的认识，树立节约用电的风气外，还应该制定一套奖励制度，在检查生产时把节约电力作为检查的内容之一。只有这样，才能最经济最合理的使用每一度电力。
