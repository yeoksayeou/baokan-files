　　Sorrows in a "Sweet Potato Bumper Harvest County"
　　Mengcun Hui Autonomous County in Hebei Province is a "sweet potato bumper harvest county" that emerged this year. This county does not possess any special conditions; 70% of the county's land is saline-alkali land; some Hui compatriots have relatively poor production techniques, and the amount of fertilizer applied to the land is also relatively low. However, this year, based on collectivization, thanks to the efforts of leading cadres and the broad masses, there was a sweet potato bumper harvest. The average yield of spring sweet potatoes is about 2,500 jin per mu, and the average yield of summer sweet potatoes is about 1,500 jin per mu.
　　The sweet potato bumper harvest has brought joy to the broad masses of commune members, but it has also brought sorrow.
　　Mengcun Hui Autonomous County has a total of twenty-seven advanced cooperatives. In the fifteen northern cooperatives, sweet potatoes converted into grain account for more than 30% of the total grain distributed to commune members; in the twelve southern cooperatives, sweet potatoes converted into grain account for more than 50% of the total grain distributed to commune members, and in some cooperatives, it even reaches 80%. For example, in the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative of Jiangguantun Township, the total population of the cooperative is 7,516, and the average sweet potato production this year is nearly 2,000 jin per person. Why were so many sweet potatoes planted this year? The answer to this question is not difficult: because sweet potatoes are a high-yield crop. Indeed, according to this county, even the worst soil can yield 2,000 jin of spring sweet potatoes per mu. Calculating four jin of sweet potatoes as one jin of grain, a total of 500 jin of grain is converted, which is several times higher than the yield of other grain crops. From the perspective of increasing production targets alone, planting more sweet potatoes seems to be beneficial. However, if we consider the needs of the country and the people, problems arise.
　　Commune members' families do not receive much grain, but sweet potatoes are piled up like mountains. People hope to sell the sweet potatoes on the market and exchange them for necessities, but it is not so smooth. At first, the price of sweet potatoes on the market was six or seven jin for one jiao, then it fell to eight or nine jin for one jiao, and now it is ten jin for one jiao, which is cheaper than sorghum stalks and fodder. Currently, grain is being purchased under unified state control. The County People's Committee stipulates that general sweet potatoes should be adjusted within the cooperative, distributed to commune members for consumption, or exchanged for grain on the market. For cooperatives with particularly large harvests, after deducting consumption by people and livestock (pigs raised by Han farmers), the state purchases 40% to 60% of the surplus sweet potato chips. The regulations are easy to say, but there are many problems in implementing them. Just take letting farmers exchange grain on the market as an example. Because there are many sweet potatoes and little grain in the county, the state price and the market price of grain are very different. For example, the state price for wheat is one jiao and one fen per jin, but some markets trade at one jiao and eight fen per jin. The transaction method is also very clever: the tax bill is written openly according to the state price; behind the scenes, both parties pay according to the "black price," deceiving market management personnel. Farmers suffer "losses on both ends" (suffering losses from the falling price of selling sweet potatoes and the rising price of buying grain), so some have no choice but to watch the sweet potatoes rot.
　　Not only are the farmers worried, but the cooperative cadres are also worried. Because the soil conditions of each cooperative are different, some production teams within a cooperative plant more, while others plant less. However, in today's situation of falling sweet potato prices, reasonable planting has also caused conflicts. For example, the tenth production team (Luotuan Village) of the Sanxing Agricultural Cooperative in Shiqiao Township planted a total of 500 mu of sweet potatoes, while the ninth production team (Zhengdao Village) did not plant any due to unsuitable soil. During the autumn harvest distribution, the cooperative committee decided to transfer 60,000 jin of sweet potatoes from the tenth production team to the ninth production team. However, the commune members of the tenth production team saw that the sweet potatoes on the market were ten jin for one jiao, calculated that they would suffer a great loss, complained everywhere, and refused to accept the transfer. This hindered the smooth progress of the autumn harvest distribution work. Seeing that there were so many cheap sweet potatoes, the commune members desperately wanted grain. Commune members of the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Gaozhai Township even divided up some of the good varieties that the cooperative had retained. Because of this, the cooperative cadres are worried and anxious all day long.
　　Now, it is said that even the cadres above the township level are also worried. According to this year's situation, this is a surplus grain county, and it is impossible to ask the state for more grain. However, because commune members receive a lot of sweet potatoes and eat less grain, and some commune members lack storage experience and worry about mold and rot, they demand a quick sale or exchange of part of the sweet potatoes. In this case, the correct approach is to organize commune members to exchange grain in areas with more grain production, or to sell sweet potatoes themselves and then buy back grain and supplies from the free market. But they did not do this; instead, they restricted peddlers from entering and leaving the border to transport sweet potatoes. Why did they do this? Let's listen to what Wang Ruting, the secretary of the Shiqiao Township Committee of the Communist Party of China, has to say: "If we let the peddlers transport all the sweet potatoes away, then in the spring, strings of people will come to the township government asking to solve the grain shortage problem, and the township cadres will be responsible. How can we ever finish being 'responsible'?" They do not take the initiative to solve the problem, but simply carry out "economic blockade," which in fact does not solve the problem. Some peddlers often smuggle goods at night, which further exacerbates the fall in sweet potato prices.
　　This problem has not yet been resolved.

### “甘薯丰产县”里的忧愁

　　“甘薯丰产县”里的忧愁
    河北省孟村回族自治县是今年涌现出来的一个“甘薯丰产县”。这个县并没有具备什么特殊条件，全县70％的土地是盐碱地；一些回
  族同胞，生产技术比较差，土地施肥量也较低。但是，今年在合作化的基础上，由于领导干部和广大群众的努力，甘薯丰收。一般春甘薯平均每亩产二千五百斤左右，夏甘薯平均每亩产一千五百斤左右。
      甘薯的丰收，给广大社员带来了喜悦，但也带来了忧愁。
      孟村回族自治县共有二十七个高级社，北部十五个社分配的甘薯折粮占社员分粮总数的30％以上；南部十二个社甘薯折粮占社员分粮总数的50％以上，有的社竟达到80％。例如姜官屯乡前进农业社，全社共计七千五百一十六口人，今年所产的甘薯，每人平均将近两千斤。为什么今年种这样多甘薯呢？这问题不难回答：因为甘薯是高产作物。确实如此，按这县说来，较次的土质每亩春甘薯也能收二千斤。以四斤甘薯折一斤粮计算，共折粮五百斤，比种其他粮食作物产量高几倍。光从增产指标着眼，多种甘薯似乎是有好处的。可是，如果考虑一下国家和人民的需要，问题就来了。
    社员们家家分粮不多，甘薯却堆积如山。人们希望把甘薯拿到市场上卖了，换回些必需品，但也并不那么顺利。起初，集市上甘薯价格是一角钱六、七斤，后来落到一角钱八、九斤，现在是一角钱十斤，比秫秸和饲草都贱。目前进行粮食统购，县人民委员会规定：一般的甘薯由社内自行调剂，分给社员吃用或到市场去交换粮食。对收获特多的社扣除人、畜（汉族农民养的猪）消费后，国家收购多余部分40％至60％的甘薯干。规定好说，执行起来问题真不少。就说让农民到集市上换粮吧，因为全县甘薯多粮食少，粮食的牌价和市价脱节很厉害。例如小麦国家牌价规定一角一分钱一斤，有的集市上却是一角八分一斤成交。成交办法也很巧妙，公开写税票的时候按牌价；背后交款的时候，双方按“黑价”，欺骗集市管理人员。农民落个“两头吃亏”（卖甘薯落价吃亏，买粮食涨价吃亏），所以有的就只好看着甘薯坏掉。
    不光农民发愁，社干部也发愁。因各社的土质条件不同，一个社内有的队种的就多，有的种的就少。但是在今天甘薯价格下跌的情况下，合理的种植也引起了矛盾。如石桥乡三星农业社的第十生产队
  （罗疃村），共种甘薯五百亩，第九生产队（正道村）因土质不适宜没有种植。秋收分配的时候，社务委员会决议，从第十生产队调甘薯六万斤给第九生产队，而该队的社员见集市上的甘薯一角钱十斤，计算起来要吃很大亏，怨声四起，拒绝接受。这就妨碍了秋收分配工作的顺利进行。社员们见到甘薯又多又贱，都拼命要粮食。高寨乡光明农业社社员，把社里保留的一部分优良品种也分掉了。为此，社干部整日发愁上火，坐立不安。
    现在，据说乡以上的脱产干部也正在担忧发愁。按今年的年景计算，这是个余粮县，不可能再向国家要粮。但是，因为社员分的甘薯多，吃粮少，再加有些社员缺乏贮藏经验，担心霉烂，要求迅速出售或调换一部分。在这种情况下，正确的作法是组织社员到产粮多的地区调换粮食，或把甘薯自产自销然后再到自由市场买回粮食和用品。但是他们没有这样作，反而限制小贩出入路境贩运甘薯。他们为什么这样作？听听中共石桥乡党委书记王汝亭的说法吧：“如果让小贩把甘薯都给运走，到春天乡政府里又一去一串串的人要求解决粮荒问题，又让乡干部负责，光‘负责’还有个完吗？”他们不去主动解决问题，只是单纯进行“经济封锁”，实际上问题还是解决不了。有些小贩常常夜间偷着捣运，更助长了甘薯价格的下跌。
    这问题现在还没解决。
