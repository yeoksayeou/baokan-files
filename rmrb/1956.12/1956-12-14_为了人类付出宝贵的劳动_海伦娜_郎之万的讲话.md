From the Franklin and Curie Commemorative Meeting

    Dedicated Precious Labor for Humanity
    Helena Langevin's Speech
    Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Friends:
    My husband and I are deeply moved to have the opportunity to be with you all at this commemorative meeting.
    This year, 1956, marks the fiftieth anniversary of Pierre Curie's death, and also the year of the unfortunate passing of Madame Irène Joliot-Curie, who, like her father, left her work and her family too soon!
    Pierre Curie's name, along with that of his wife, Marie Skłodowska, is often praised for their contribution to nuclear physics through the discovery of radium.
    Professor Zvolowski has already spoken to you about the brilliant development of this science, and its applications, which can be beneficial or harmful to all mankind; and the attention it has thus aroused in all quarters.
    Pierre Curie was born on May 15, 1859, near the Paris Natural History Museum Institute, where his father worked. He was the second son of Dr. Eugène Curie, who was a doctor and the son of a doctor. He originally hoped to dedicate his life to scientific work, but the heavy burden of family—his marriage and the birth of his two sons—forced him to abandon this plan. Dr. Curie could only cultivate his two children with a love for science, ensuring that they received proper education and guiding their interests towards a love of natural science. Pierre and Jacques Curie did not receive a classical education. This fact undoubtedly left a strong mark on Pierre Curie's character; and it also helped him develop his scientific talent.
    It is interesting to compare Pierre Curie's scientific life—from 1881 to 1906—with Marie Curie's scientific life between 1897 and 1934. Marie Curie's life's work was almost entirely devoted to the study of radioactivity, so she was delving into a particular branch of physics, as almost all scientists do today. Pierre Curie, on the contrary, represented the scientists of the previous century. For him, the entire field of physics was familiar, he was a thinker, as well as a flexible experimentalist, and a creator of instruments and new technologies.
    Pierre Curie obtained his bachelor's degree in physics at the age of eighteen; in the same year, to supplement his material needs, he served as a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris. There, he worked for five years and began his initial experimental work.
    He collaborated with his brother in the study of crystals. In this work, he introduced the concept of symmetry in crystallography and discovered a new phenomenon: the piezoelectric effect, and its inverse phenomenon, that is, the phenomenon of crystal lattices being deformed by the action of an electric field.
    The study of the piezoelectric effect enabled the Curie brothers to establish a tool and method for electrostatic measurement. Using piezoelectric quartz wafers, coupled with a new electrometer, it became possible to measure the absolute value of extremely weak currents.
    In 1883, Pierre and Jacques Curie separated to work independently. Pierre continued his scientific research, first as the director of the laboratory and later as a professor at the Paris Municipal School of Industrial Physics and Chemistry. Pierre worked in this school for twenty-two years, spending almost his entire scientific life there.
    His position as laboratory director left him with little spare time to engage in experimental work. He devoted himself to the theoretical study of crystal symmetry. The extension of this theory eventually established a "law of symmetry" applicable to all physical phenomena without exception.
    Pierre Curie's work in this research area was very fundamental, although he later changed to other research areas, he often maintained a keen interest in the study of crystal physics.
    Later, Pierre Curie set up a research room between a staircase and a student laboratory. It was in this narrow corridor that he completed his famous magnetic studies, and it was also here that he created the accurate Curie balance, which is now used worldwide.
    Because of scientific work, he developed feelings for Marie Skłodowska, a young Polish student who came to Paris in 1892, and they married on July 25, 1895.
    We know that the joint work of Pierre Curie and Marie originated from the then so-called "uranium rays" discovered by Becquerel. Placing uranium salts on photographic plates would sensitize the plates, just like the action of ordinary light, or like the X-rays newly discovered by Röntgen at the time.
    Marie Curie took on the task of finding the source of these mysterious rays as her doctoral thesis. This work required an accurate quantitative method to measure the emitted rays. It was thanks to the micro-current measurement technology successfully researched by Pierre and Jacques Curie that the measurement of ionization current caused by these rays became possible.
    It may be useful for us to talk about their experimental situation: because of the lack of good conditions, they had to work in a glass shed used as a warehouse and machine room. Such an environment caused serious difficulties for the normal operation of the instruments more than once. We can see that on the page in their research record book recording the electrometer measurement results, it is written: Temperature of the ionization chamber: 6 degrees, followed by three exclamation marks.
    Marie Curie quickly came to a significant conclusion: the emitted rays are a characteristic of the uranium atom. The intensity of the rays is independent of the form of combination, and independent of external environments such as temperature and pressure. She then set out to study whether other elements have the characteristics of uranium. Among all known elements, only thorium has similar radioactivity, but most noteworthy was the observation that certain uranium- or thorium-containing minerals have "abnormal" radioactivity. Could the source of this radioactivity be due to an unknown trace substance in the ore? This hypothesis was worth confirming. Pierre Curie began at this time to abandon his crystal research work and devote his energy to helping Marie Curie. We know from their research record books that he worked closely with his wife and had already participated in several experiments.
    Chemical separation using ordinary methods, but using radioactivity measurements to check the separation results, soon identified two new radioactive elements in the original pitchblende, which were more radioactive than uranium: "polonium" was discovered in July 1898. Soon after, radium was also discovered.
    Marie Curie wanted to name the first radioactive element she discovered after her motherland: Poland, but the most interesting element was still the radium she later discovered.
    We might think that the key points of the work had been completed by this point. In fact, no, now it was necessary to separate polonium and radium, which were still in trace amounts, from the bismuth and barium they were with. In fact, chemists still had great doubts about whether the new elements only revealed by rays actually existed. They could only be convinced when they were presented with some pure radium salts and measured the atomic weight of radium.
    To achieve this result, years of effort were required under arduous material conditions: it was necessary to process several tons of pitchblende residue without any help. Marie Curie wrote in her book about Pierre Curie: "During this period of our work, we often felt extremely disadvantaged due to the lack of suitable conditions. Lack of space, lack of money and assistants." After winning the Nobel Prize, she humbly wrote in "fiction" about "the dull scientist's workplace hut". In reality, this famous hut did not have a fume hood to exhaust toxic gases, and it often froze in winter. The dust inside the house often fell into the containers holding precious chemical substances, and it also harmed their health.
    Economic hardship forced Pierre and Marie Curie to increase their teaching duties. Pierre Curie became a lecturer at the University of Paris in 1900, and Marie Curie lectured at the École Normale Supérieure for girls in Paris. Teaching further disrupted their research because they did not even have a convenient research room. By 1903, the two great French scientists who won the Nobel Prize did not yet have a proper research institute!
    We can know from Pierre Curie's words the bitterness he felt at the time for his efforts in this regard, which were ineffective. He said: "Please thank the Minister on my behalf, and inform him that I do not need any praise at all, my greatest need is a laboratory."
    It was under such difficult conditions that Pierre and Marie Curie achieved many achievements. We can particularly point out the following: the study of induced radioactivity and emanation properties; the discovery of heat generation by radium, the study of the physiological effects of radium rays, these effects became the origin of "Curie therapy".
    Pierre Curie's accidental death cruelly interrupted his and Marie Curie's never-ending scientific collaboration. Marie Curie continued her research alone, measuring the atomic weight of pure radium and establishing radium standards so that the measurement results of laboratories in various countries could be compared with each other. Later, she also succeeded Pierre Curie as a professor at the University of Paris and established the Radium Institute.
    The war in 1914 interrupted Marie Curie's scientific research work. She participated in the construction of X-ray therapy machines and installed them in field hospitals.
    After the war, Marie Curie devoted herself entirely to the new research institute. This huge research institution became the source of almost all French researchers engaged in radioactivity and nuclear physics research. The institute was also greatly open to research workers of other nationalities.
    Marie Curie died of dangerous anemia caused by long-term radioactive effects in 1934. The Radium Institute was first led by André Debierne, and later by Madame Irène Joliot-Curie, becoming the center of French nuclear physics research. It is now led by Mr. Frédéric Joliot-Curie. The new laboratories of the Radium Institute under construction in Orsay will once again become a place for basic research in nuclear physics. This research center will also guarantee the connection between nuclear physics and other related sciences.
    This brief history of the careers of Pierre and Marie Curie in fact proves the interrelationship and mutual enrichment of the various fields of science. In our era, which particularly needs specialization due to the development of research technology, this should not be forgotten. The results obtained by Pierre Curie working alone in the past century can now only be obtained in basic scientific research institutions that bring together many kinds of experts and work in close cooperation. We must also not forget that in modern scientific fields, as in nuclear physics, there are extremely important practical categories.
    From this point of view, the social organization of the country is the most important factor, which can determine the coordination and development of basic science and applied science research in various categories.
    The lives of Pierre and Marie Curie also illustrate to us what the lack of material and spiritual resources can be like, or how the existence of certain social organizations can be of inestimable value to scientific workers.
    On this question, Marie Curie said: "What are the rewards for scientists in our society, who dedicate their precious work for humanity in order to fulfill their noble vocation? Do they have the necessary research tools for these servants of thought? Do they have life security without worrying about poverty? The examples of Pierre Curie and many others prove that nothing is available. On the contrary, in order to obtain the conditions under which they can work, people often exhaust their youth and strength in daily life worries first. Our society, shrouded in a desire to pursue wealth and glory, does not recognize the value of science, it does not understand that science is the most precious property of the country, nor does it fully appreciate that science is the foundation of all progress in improving human life and alleviating people's suffering. It is hoped that this truth can be more widely and deeply spread in the consciousness of the masses, so that our future will not be as difficult as our predecessors, and that they will open up new fields for the universal happiness of mankind."
    This truth, unfortunately, has not yet been accepted in many countries like our country.
    But the value of this call has been realized in socialist systems, such as China, the country where we are honored to be invited to today. Only such countries can give their scientists the greatest love, give effective attention, and establish the most favorable conditions for scientific undertakings for the benefit of the country.

    Note: This speech was delivered by Helena Langevin on behalf of herself and her husband, Michel Langevin, at the commemorative meeting.

### 为了人类付出宝贵的劳动  海伦娜·郎之万的讲话

专栏：在富兰克林、居里夫妇纪念会上

    为了人类付出宝贵的劳动
    海伦娜·郎之万的讲话主席先生：各位夫人、先生，亲爱的朋友们：
    这次，我们能够在这个纪念会里有机会和大家在一起，使我的丈夫和我，受到极大的感动。
    今年，1956年，是皮埃尔·居里逝世的五十周年，同时也是伊仑
  ·约里奥·居里夫人不幸逝世的一年，同她父亲一样，她离开她的工作和她的家庭太早了！
    皮埃尔·居里的名字，和他的妻子玛丽·斯谷都夫斯卡一道，由于他们发现镭而对原子核物理学所作出的贡献，常常被人们所称道。
    兹沃托夫斯基教授已经和大家谈过这门科学的光辉发展，和它对全人类的可以有利，也可以有害的应用；并且由此在各方面所引起的注意。
    皮埃尔·居里在1859年5月15日诞生，地点在他父亲工作的巴黎自然历史博物馆研究所的附近。他是额任纳·居里医生的次子。额任纳·居里是一位医生，也是一位医生的儿子。他本来希望把自己的生命贡献在科学工作里，但是家庭负担的重荷——他的结婚和他的两个儿子的出生——使得他不得不放弃了这个计划。居里医生只有在对科学的热爱中去培养他的两个孩子，并且保证他们获得适当的教育，引导他们的志趣去热爱自然科学。皮埃尔和耶克·居里没有接受过经典的教育。这事实无疑地在皮埃尔·居里的性格上留下一种强烈的影响；而且也帮助了他发展他科学的才华。
    拿皮埃尔·居里的科学生活——自1881年起至1906年止——和玛丽·居里自1897至1934年之间的科学生活相比，是很有兴趣的。玛丽·居里的毕生工作差不多全部从事于放射性的研究，因此她是在物理学上的一个特别部门内钻研的，这正如今日差不多所有的科学家一样。皮埃尔·居里却相反地代表着上一世纪的科学家。对于他，整个物理学部门是他所熟知的，他是一个思想家，同时也是一个灵活的实验家，又是一个仪器与新技术的创造者。
    皮埃尔·居里十八岁的时候就获得了物理学的学士衔；同年为了补助自己物质上的需要，他担任了巴黎大学理学院助教。在那里，他工作了五年，开始了他的最初的实验工作。
    他和他哥哥合作，从事晶体的研究。在这个工作中，他引起了对于结晶学的对称概念，并且发现了一种新的现象：压电现象，和它的反现象，即晶体格子受电场的作用而引起形变的现象。
    压电现象的研究使居里兄弟建立一种静电测量的工具和方法。利用了压电石英片，配合了新的静电计，从此可以将极微弱电流的绝对值测量出来。
    1883年皮埃尔和耶克·居里分开工作，皮埃尔继续他的科学研究，在巴黎市立理化学院先担任实验室主任，后任教授职务。皮埃尔在这学校内工作了二十二年，度过了他的几乎全部科学生活。
    他的实验室主任的职务使他没有多余的时间去从事实验工作。他致力于晶体对称性的理论研究。这种理论的扩展最后成立了一种可以适用于一切物理现象而毫无例外的“对称定律”。
    皮埃尔·居里在这个研究范围内所做的工作是很基本的，虽则以后他改换了别种研究范围，但是对晶体物理的研究，他时常保持着一种热烈的兴趣。
    后来，皮埃尔·居里在一个楼梯和一间学生实验室之间，设置了一间研究室。就在这狭窄的走廊里他完成了他的著名的磁学研究，也就在这里他造成了现在全世界都采用的准确的居里式天平。
    因为科学工作上的关系，他和在1892年来到巴黎的年青波兰女学生玛丽·斯谷都夫斯卡发生了感情，在1895年7月25日他们结了婚。
    我们知道，皮埃尔·居里和玛丽的共同工作，是起源于贝克勒尔发现的当时所谓“铀射线”。把铀盐置放在照相板上，就会使照相板感光，好像普通光线的作用一样，或者和当时伦琴所新发现的X射线一样使照相板感光。
    玛丽·居里就负起寻找这些神秘射线来源的研究工作，当作她的博士论文。这项工作需要一种准确的定量方法，以测量所放出的射线。因由于皮埃尔和耶克·居里研究成功的极微弱电流的测量技术，才使得这些射线所引起的游离电流的测定成为可能。
    我们谈谈他们的实验情况也许不是没有用处的：因为缺少良好的条件，他们不得不在一所当作仓库和机械室用的玻璃棚内工作。这样的环境对仪器的正常运用，不只一次地造成严重的困难。我们可以见到，在他们的研究记录本中记录静电计测量结果的那一页上写着：游离室的温度：6度，后面画着三个感叹号。
    玛丽·居里很快得出有意义的结论来了：发出的射线是铀原子的一种特性。射线的强度与化合的形态既无关，与温度、压力等外在的环境也无关。她于是着手研究是否其他的元素都具有铀的特性。在所有已知的元素里，只有钍有相似的放射性，但是最值得注意的是观察到若干含铀或含钍矿物中具有“异常”的放射性，这种放射性的来源是否会由于矿石中还含有一种未知的微量物质呢？这种假说是值得去确定的。皮埃尔·居里从这时开始，放弃了晶体研究工作，把精力帮助玛丽·居里。我们在他们的研究记录本上知道，他随着他的妻子密切地工作，并且已经参加了若干次实验了。
    用普通方法进行的化学分离，但是用放射性测量来检查分离结果的方法，不久即在原始的沥青铀矿中认出了两种新的放射性元素，比铀的放射性更强：“钋”就在1898年7月被发现了。不久以后，镭也被发现了。
    玛丽·居里，想把她祖国的名字：波兰来命名她发现的第一个放射性元素，但最有兴趣的元素还是她在以后发现的镭。
    我们可能会想，工作的要点到此已经完成。其实并不，现在需要把尚在痕量状态的钋和镭和它们在一起的铋和钡分离出来。事实上，化学家们对只由射线显示出来的新元素是否确实存在，还抱着极大的怀疑。只有在他们面前放着一些纯的镭盐，和测定镭的原子量的时候，才能说服他们。
    为了取得这个结果，需要在艰苦的物质条件下作多年的努力：必需处理沥青铀矿残渣好几吨而无一人帮助。玛丽·居里在她为皮埃尔·居里所写的书中写道：“就在我们工作的这个时期，我们常常因为缺乏适当的条件而感到极度的不利。缺少地方，缺少金钱和助手。”她在获得诺贝尔奖金以后谦逊地以“小说体”写着“乏味的科学家工作的小屋”。实际上这间著名的小屋，却没有通风橱以排泄有毒的气体，在冬天又常常结冰，屋子里面的尘埃常常落到放置珍贵的化学物质的器皿内，还伤害了他们的健康。
    经济的窘迫，使得皮埃尔和玛丽·居里不得不加重兼任教师的职务。皮埃尔·居里在1900年担任巴黎大学讲师，玛丽·居里则在巴黎高等女子师范学校讲课。教学工作更扰乱了他们的研究，因为他们一个方便的研究室也没有。到1903年时，获得诺贝尔奖金的两位法国伟大的科学家，还没有适当的研究所呵！
    我们可以从皮埃尔·居里的话中，知道当时对他为此努力然而无效所感到的苦闷。他说：“请您代我谢谢部长先生，并且通知他，我丝毫不需要加以任何褒奖，我最大的需要是一个实验室。”
    就在这样困难的条件下，皮埃尔和玛丽·居里取得了很多的成就。我们可以特别指出的是：放射性诱导和射气特性的研究；镭发生热量的发现，镭射线的生理效应的研究，这些效应成为“居里治疗术”的原始。
    皮埃尔·居里意外的死亡残酷地中断了他和玛丽·居里的从未间断过的科学合作。玛丽·居里一个人继续研究，测定纯镭的原子量和制定镭的标准，以便各国实验室的测量结果可以互相比较。后来，她也继承着皮埃尔·居里，在巴黎大学任教授，并且建立了镭学研究所。
    1914年的战争中断了玛丽·居里的科学研究工作，她参加了爱克斯光治疗机的建造工作，并且把它们装置在战地医院里。
    战后，玛丽·居里把自己完全贡献给新的研究所。这个巨大的研究机构成了差不多所有的法国从事于放射性和原子核物理学研究人员的源流。研究所对其他国籍的研究工作人员也同样大大地开放着。
    玛丽·居里在1934年由于长期的放射性影响染上危险的贫血症病逝。镭学研究所首先是由安特烈·德比耶继续领导，后来又由伊仑·约里奥·居里夫人领导，成为法国原子核物理研究的中心。现在它是由佛德烈·约里奥—居里先生领导着。镭学研究所正在奥尔赛建筑的新实验室将重新成为原子核物理基本研究的地方。这个研究中心也将保证原子核物理和其他有关科学的联系。
    这个关于皮埃尔、玛丽·居里事业的简短的历史，事实上证明了科学的各个领域的互相联系，和互相丰富其内容。在我们这个由于研究技术的发展而特别需要专业化的时代，这一点是不应该忘记的。像过去的世纪中，由于皮埃尔·居里一个人工作而获得的结果，现在只能在集合许多种专家并且在紧密合作之下的基本科学研究机构之中获得。我们也不能忘记，在现代若干科学门类中，正如原子核物理一样，是包含着极其重要的实用范畴的。
    从这点看，国家的社会组织是最重要的因素了，它能够决定各种门类的基本科学和应用科学研究的调和与发展。
    皮埃尔和玛丽·居里的生平也向我们说明了物质和精神上的缺乏会是怎样情形，或者若干社会组织的存在，对于科学工作者会有怎样难以估计的价值。
    在这个问题上玛丽·居里说过：“科学家们为了尽他自己可贵的天职，为了人类而付出他宝贵的劳动，可是，在我们的社会里，对于他们的奖勉是什么呢？对于这些思想的服务者，对于他们所必需的研究工具，他们有没有呢？“他们是不是有生活上的保障而无虞于贫乏呢？皮埃尔·居里和其他许多人的例子，证明了一切都没有。相反，为了获得可以工作的条件，人们常常在日常的生活忧虑上，先耗尽了他的青春和力量。我们的社会，为一种追逐荣华富贵的欲望所笼罩着，它并没有认识到科学的价值，它不懂科学是国家最宝贵的财产，它也不充分体会到科学是改进人类生活，减轻人民疾苦的一切进步的基础。希望这个真象能够更广泛地和更深入地传播在大众的意识里，使得我们的将来，不至于像前人一样的艰苦，让他们为人类的普遍幸福开辟新的领域吧。”
    这个真相，在像我们这个国家的许多国家里，可惜还未被接受。
    但是这个呼吁的价值，已经在社会主义制度的、象我们今天荣幸地被邀请来到的中国这个国家里实现了。只有这样的国家，才能对它的科学家寄以最大的热爱，才能给以有效的注意，才能为了国家的利益而对科学事业建立最有利的条件。
    按：这篇讲话是海伦娜·郎之万代表她自己和她的丈夫密歇尔·郎之万在纪念会上讲的。
