　　Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Baghdad News: Iraqi King Faisal announced the implementation of martial law throughout the country at the opening session of Parliament on December 1st. He also ordered Parliament to suspend its work for one month at the request of Prime Minister Nuri al-Said.
　　Faisal said that the declaration of martial law was to "protect the rear of the Iraqi army now stationed in Jordan." The Iraqi army took the opportunity to send troops to Jordan after Egypt was invaded. Faisal said that the Iraqi government is strengthening the army and increasing its effectiveness with modern weapons and equipment.
　　Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: TASS, Damascus, December 1st: According to newspaper reports, the movement of the Iraqi public demanding the resignation of the Nuri al-Said government and Iraq's withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact is growing day by day. Bloody clashes have occurred between demonstrators and the army throughout the country. The death toll in recent days has reached 140.
　　The authorities have carried out large-scale arrests. Among those arrested are many well-known Iraqi socio-political activists—former ministers, members of parliament, and leaders of political parties. The growing scale of the mass demonstrations has forced Nuri al-Said to turn to the tribal chiefs, asking them to assist in suppressing the movement. However, the chiefs refused this request, stating that the movement has a liberating character and is led by well-known Iraqi religious figures.
　　There have been several instances of government troops refusing to fire on protesters, and even joining the demonstrations. There are also reports that all the leaders of the Shiite sects went to King Faisal's palace to express that they would not leave the palace if Nuri al-Said did not resign.

    用镇压政策维持赛义德政权
　　伊拉克国王宣布全国戒严
　　各地示威群众同军队发生流血冲突
    据新华社2日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克国王费萨尔12月1日在议会开幕会议上宣布在全国实施戒严令，他并且应首相努里·赛义德的请求，命令议会停止工作一个月。
    费萨尔说，宣布戒严令是为了
  “保护现在驻在约旦的伊拉克军队的后方”。伊拉克军队是在埃及遭到侵略后乘机派到约旦去的。费萨尔说，伊拉克政府正在加强陆军并以现代化的武器和装备来增加陆军的效力。
    新华社2日讯　塔斯社大马士革1日讯：据报刊消息，伊拉克公众要求努里·赛义德政府辞职，要求伊拉克退出巴格达条约的运动正在一天天高涨。全国各地游行示威者和军队之间发生了流血冲突。最近几天内死亡人数达一百四十人。
    当局进行了大规模的逮捕。被逮捕者当中有许多是伊拉克有名的社会政治活动家——过去的大臣、议会议员以及政党的领袖。群众示威运动规模的壮大，竟使努里·赛义德不得不求助于各部族的酋长，请他们协助镇压这种运动。可是酋长们拒绝了这个要求，并且声明说，这个运动带有解放的性质，而且是由伊拉克有名的宗教活动家领导的。
    曾经多次发生过政府军队拒绝向游行者开枪，甚至他们参加游行示威队伍的情形。还有消息说，所有希得教派种族的首领曾经到费萨尔国王的王宫中去表示，如果努里·赛义德不辞职，他们就不离开王宫。
