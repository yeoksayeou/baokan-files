Xinhua News Agency Report: The Qingdao Paper Mill, a local state-owned enterprise, has recently successfully used cotton stalk bark pulp to replace wood pulp in the manufacturing of paper sack kraft paper for packaging cement and pesticides. After testing, the paper's bursting strength is 6.6% higher and its tensile strength is 29% to 36% higher than paper sack kraft paper made from wood pulp; the cost is also reduced.
    The output of cotton stalk bark in Shandong Province is very large. The success of this experiment will enable the factory to find a substitute for about 50% of the wood pulp it will lack next year.
    In addition to preparing to use cotton stalk bark pulp to manufacture paper sack kraft paper and ordinary packaging paper in large quantities, the factory is also further studying the use of cotton stalk bark to manufacture high-grade paper such as printing paper.

    棉秸皮造纸
    据新华社讯　地方国营青岛造纸厂最近利用棉秸皮浆代替木浆，制造成功包装水泥和农药用的纸袋纸。经过检验，这种纸比用木浆造的纸袋纸耐破度提高6.6％，拉力提高29％到36％；成本也有降低。
    棉秸皮在山东省出产量很大。这项试验成功，将使这个工厂明年缺少的50％左右的木浆得到代用品。
    这个工厂除了准备大批利用棉秸皮浆造纸袋纸和普通包装纸以外，还在进一步研究利用棉秸皮制造印刷纸等高级纸张。
