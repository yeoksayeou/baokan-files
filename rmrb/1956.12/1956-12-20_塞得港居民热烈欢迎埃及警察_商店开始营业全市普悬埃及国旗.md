    Port Said Residents Warmly Welcome Egyptian Police
    Shops Reopen and Egyptian Flags Fly Throughout the City
    (Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 19th) Thousands of Port Said residents gathered at the Port Said railway station on the 18th to welcome the first group of Egyptian police entering the city.
    The jubilant crowd waved national flags and cheered enthusiastically for the 350 Egyptian police officers. As the police marched in formation towards their station, residents pushed past the ranks of the United Nations forces lined up along the streets to embrace the Egyptian police. They smiled, cheered, and mingled with the police as they moved forward.
    Some shops opened for the first time in over a month. Egyptian flags and portraits of Egyptian President Nasser could be seen everywhere in the city. With the phased withdrawal of the Anglo-French invading forces and the arrival of Egyptian police, the city is beginning to return to its normal state.

    塞得港居民热烈欢迎埃及警察
    商店开始营业全市普悬埃及国旗
    据新华社19日讯　开罗消息：成千的塞得港居民在18日聚集在塞得港火车站，欢迎第一批进入这个城市的埃及警察。
    兴高采烈的人群挥舞着国旗，向三百五十个埃及警察热烈欢呼。当这些警察列队向驻地行进的时候，居民们挤开了沿着大街排列的联合国部队的队伍，去拥抱埃及警察。他们笑着、欢呼着，并且同警察们混合在一起向前行进。
    一些商店一个多月来第一次开门营业。全市到处都可以看到埃及国旗和埃及总统纳赛尔的肖像。随着英法侵略军的分批撤离和埃及警察的到来，这个城市正在开始恢复它的正常状态。
