　　Heilongjiang Stores Over 500,000 Tons of New Grain
　　Inner Mongolia Transports More Grain Than Any Previous Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 1st. New grain is being marketed in large quantities across Heilongjiang Province. As of late November, the province has already stored over 500,000 tons of new grain. Among them, soybeans, renowned in the international market, are the most abundant, accounting for over 200,000 tons, and are of good quality, with over 80% being first and second grade soybeans.
    This year's autumn harvest in Heilongjiang Province was later than in previous years, and therefore the marketing of new grain was also delayed. In order to sell the new grain to the state in a timely manner, agricultural production cooperatives in many places have rationally adjusted labor and animal power, adopting methods of hauling, threshing, and delivering grain simultaneously.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot. As of now, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has transported 100,000 tons of grain out of the region. According to the person in charge of the Autonomous Region's Grain Bureau, the entire autonomous region will transport a total of 890,000 tons of unprocessed grain this year.
    Inner Mongolia has vast lands, and since liberation, agricultural production has greatly developed. Each year, large quantities of grain are transported out to support national construction. This year marks the first year that farmers of Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region have realized agricultural cooperation. The grain harvest is unprecedented, with the total output already exceeding the production target for 1957. The grain provided by farmers to the state this year exceeds any previous year, making it one of the provinces and regions with the largest amount of grain transported out of the country.
    Currently, relevant departments in the Autonomous Region are organizing transportation resources so that grain from areas with inconvenient transportation can be collected and transported to railway lines according to plan, for centralized transportation out of the region.

　　黑龙江五十多万吨新粮入库
　　内蒙古外运粮比任何一年都多
    新华社哈尔滨1日电　黑龙江省各地新粮大量上市。到11月下旬为止，全省已经入库新粮五十多万吨。其中驰名国际市场的大豆最多，有二十多万吨，而且质量较好，80％以上是一等和二等大豆。
    今年黑龙江省秋收比往年来得晚，因此新粮上市也较迟。许多地方的农业生产合作社为了及时把新粮卖给国家，都合理调整劳动力和畜力，采取了边拉、边打、边送粮的办法。
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区到目前为止，已运出粮食十万吨。据自治区粮食厅负责人告诉新华社记者，全自治区今年共将外运原粮八十九万吨。
    内蒙古土地广阔，解放以来，农业生产有很大发展，每年都运出大批粮食支援国家建设。今年是自治区蒙汉等族农民实现农业合作化的第一年，粮食空前丰收，总产量已超额完成1957年的产量指标。今年农民提供给国家的粮食超过过去任何一年，是全国外运粮食最多的省区之一。
    现在，自治区有关部门正在组织运输力量，以便交通不便地区的粮食能按计划集运到铁路沿线，集中外运。
