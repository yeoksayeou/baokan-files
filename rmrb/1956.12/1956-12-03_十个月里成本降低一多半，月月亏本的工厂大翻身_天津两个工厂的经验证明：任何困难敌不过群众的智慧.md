Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 2nd: By mobilizing workers to solve key production problems, the Tianjin Municipal Public-Private Joint Venture Xinxing Steel Plant reversed its long-term losses and failure to meet state plans. In October and November, it overproduced a total of more than 1,100 tons of steel. The cost per ton of steel ingot in October was 16.21% lower than in the third quarter. Profits reached more than 147,000 yuan. It is estimated that not only will the factory be able to complete its plan for the entire year, but it may also overproduce more than 500 tons of steel.

From January to September, this factory failed to meet its cost plan every month, accumulating losses of more than 786,000 yuan in nine months. Production plans for the second and third quarters were also not completed, resulting in an underproduction of more than 2,000 tons of steel. The main reason for this situation was the short lifespan of the steelmaking furnace (converter). Starting in September, factory leaders and cadres went to workshops to organize workers to study the problem. Workers discussed the issue and concluded that the short lifespan of the steelmaking furnace was mainly due to problems with furnace repair and baking. Veteran worker Zhou Chunxiu, young worker Li Qiwang, and others proposed many methods for repairing the furnace. The factory leadership tested each method and finally found the best way to extend the lifespan of the steelmaking furnace. Good methods were also found for furnace baking, batching, and steelmaking operations.

After these measures were implemented, the lifespan of the furnace was extended, and the repair time was shortened. The first workshop could only produce steel 61 times for each furnace repair in September, but this increased to 69 times in October, saving more than 2,700 yuan in repair costs alone.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 1st: Leaders of the Tianjin Municipal Dye Chemical Industry Company's Fourth Factory paid attention to relying on and utilizing the wisdom of workers and technicians, reducing the production cost of the new product, Basic Chrome Yellow Lake, by 58.9% in ten months.

Basic Chrome Yellow Lake is an indispensable dye for dyeing yellow silk fabrics, painting desks and chairs, and dyeing yellow leather, and it has traditionally relied on imports. The factory began trial production of this new product in March of this year. During the trial production, Communist Youth League member Gong Bao first proposed using water instead of hydrochloric acid. Young worker Kang Rongchang also found that the product was very acidic and believed that the amount of sodium acetate and hydrochloric acid used could be greatly reduced. Zhang Kelian, the head of the first shift, further proposed increasing the charging amount to improve the recovery rate of the colorant.

The suggestions made by the workers were supported by the factory director, and the leadership mobilized workers and technicians to further study the issue. After eighteen trials, it was proven that the workers' suggestions were correct, and their adoption greatly reduced costs. For example, the amount of hydrochloric acid and sodium acetate required to produce one ton of Basic Chrome Yellow Lake was reduced from nearly seven tons to just over half a ton.

Even after costs had been significantly reduced, the workers were not satisfied. Worker Kang Rongchang constantly researched and experimented, believing that soda ash could be used to replace sodium acetate altogether. This suggestion alone could reduce the cost of each ton of Basic Chrome Yellow Lake by more than 470 yuan. Now, the consumption of all raw materials has been reduced again, and the cost per ton of Basic Chrome Yellow Lake is 58.9% lower than in April, while the product quality is fully qualified. According to tests by the Tianjin United Import and Export Corporation, its quality has reached international standards, and its color strength is 5% higher than that of the German "Dragon Lamp" brand Basic Chrome Yellow Lake, which China used to import in large quantities.

　　十个月里成本降低一多半，月月亏本的工厂大翻身
　　天津两个工厂的经验证明：
　　任何困难敌不过群众的智慧
    据新华社天津2日电　天津市公私合营新兴钢厂发动职工解决生产关键问题，扭转了长期亏损和完不成国家计划的情况，10月和11月两个月共超产了一千一百多吨钢，10月份每吨钢锭成本比第三季度降低了16.21％。盈利达到十四万七千多元。预计今年全年不但能完成计划，还可能超产五百多吨钢。
    这个厂从1月到9月，月月完不成成本计划，九个月中亏累了七十八万六千多元，第二季度和第三季度的生产计划也没完成，少生产了两千多吨钢。造成这种情况的主要原因是炼钢炉（转炉）的寿命短。从9月份起，工厂领导人和干部面向车间到车间去组织工人研究。工人讨论结果，认为炼钢炉寿命短，主要是修炉和烤炉的问题。老师傅周春秀，青年工人李其望等提出了很多种修炉方法，工厂领导方面把每一种方法都试验了一次，最后找到了延长炼钢炉寿命的最好的方法。在烤炉、配料和炼钢操作等方面也找出了好办法。
    这些措施实现以后，炉的寿命延长了，修炉时间缩短了。第一车间9月份每修一次炉只能炼钢六十一次，10月份增加到六十九次，光是修炉费用就节省了两千七百多元。
    据新华社天津1日电　天津市染料化学工业公司第四厂领导人注意依靠和发挥工人、技术人员的智慧，使新产品盐基杏黄块的生产成本在十个月中降低了58.9％。
    盐基杏黄块是染黄色绸料、油刷桌椅和染黄色皮革不可缺少的染料，过去一向依靠进口。今年3月份工厂开始试制这种新产品。在试制中，青年团员宫保首先提出了用水代替盐酸的建议。青年工人康荣昌也发现产品酸性很强，认为醋酸钠和盐酸的用量都可以大大减少。甲班班长张克廉更提出了可以提高色料收获率的加大投料建议。
    工人们提出的建议，得到了厂长的支持，领导方面并且发动工人和技术人员进一步研究。经过十八次的试验，证明工人的建议是正确的，采用以后使成本大为降低。例如制造一吨盐基杏黄块需要的盐酸和醋酸钠就从将近七吨降低到半吨多。
    在成本已经显著降低的情况下，工人们并没有满足。工人康荣昌不断钻研和试验，认为完全可以用碱面代替醋酸钠，只这一项建议就可以使每吨盐基杏黄块的成本再降低四百七十多元。现在，所有的原料消耗又都降低了，每吨盐基杏黄块的成本比4月份降低了58.9％，而产品质量完全合格。据天津市联合进出口公司的化验，它的质量达到了国际水平，比我国过去大量使用的德国“龙灯牌”盐基杏黄块的色力还高5％。
