Xinhua News Agency Report: The results of pilot land planning work conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and some provinces and regions in various locations demonstrate that carrying out land planning for agricultural cooperatives is very important for expanding land utilization area, further rationalizing land use, and guaranteeing increased agricultural production through the development of diversified economies.

According to statistics from fifty-eight agricultural cooperatives of different types in Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Guizhou, Yunnan, Beijing, and other provinces and cities, in a total land area of more than 1.71 million mu, there are more than 210,000 mu of wasteland and barren hills, accounting for more than 12% of the total land area. After land planning, the increase in cultivated land is equivalent to about 5% of the existing cultivated land area. Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Suining County, Sichuan Province, newly increased orchards, mulberry gardens, tung oil plantations, and other economic crop planting areas by more than 800 mu through the rational use of barren slopes, earthen embankments, and reed lands. After comprehensive planning of the land in Nantong Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangsu Province, the increased cultivated land also exceeded 1,000 mu.

    农业部和一些省区在许多农业社试验证明
    进行土地规划后耕地面积扩大
    据新华社讯　农业部和一些省区在各地进行土地规划试点工作结果说明：开展农业社的土地规划工作，对于扩大土地利用面积、进一步合理利用土地和发展多种经济保证农业增产很重要。
    据河北、山西、辽宁、陕西、甘肃、山东、江苏、福建、河南、湖北、贵州、云南、北京等省市不同类型的五十八个农业社统计，在一百七十一万多亩的土地总面积中，荒地荒山有二十一万多亩，占土地总面积12％以上，经过土地规划以后，增加的耕地相当于现有耕地面积的5％左右。四川省遂宁县红光农业社因为合理利用荒坡、土埂和芦苇地，新增加了果园、桑园、油桐和其他经济作物的种植面积达八百多亩。江苏省南通曙光农业社的土地在进行全面规划以后，增加的耕地也在一千亩以上。
