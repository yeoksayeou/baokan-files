    Produce More Pork for the People
    Yong'an Farm in Heilongjiang to be Expanded into a Large-Scale Pig Farm
    Expected to Produce 25,000 Fat Pigs in 1958
    (Our Newspaper) News - The Yong'an State-owned Farm in the Mishan Reclamation Area of Heilongjiang Province has decided to expand into a large-scale pig farm because local soil and climate conditions are favorable for sowing high-yield feed crops.
    Yong'an Farm was originally a medium-sized grain farm, and it already has a solid foundation in pig farming, with nearly a thousand pigs currently. In order to guarantee the people's need for meat, the farm is now starting to formulate a plan for the comprehensive development of pig farming next year. The preliminary decision is: to reclaim 5,000 hectares of wasteland next year, and together with the existing land, a total of 8,000 hectares will be mostly planted with feed crops. It is expected that 25,000 fat pigs can be produced in 1958. Feeding and feed processing will be done mechanically or semi-mechanically.
    The farm's workers and leading cadres are extremely excited about the large-scale development of pig farming, and they said that they will serve as a demonstration for the new pig farms being built in Mishan, Hulin, and other places. Currently, the farm has sent a group of employees to the forest area to cut timber; it is expected that 5,000 cubic meters of timber can be cut before the thaw, which will be used to build 30,000 square meters of pigsties and auxiliary buildings. Pig-raising model worker Li Yongbing will train a large number of breeders for the farm.

    为人民生产更多的猪肉
    黑龙江永安农场将扩建为大型养猪场
    预计1958年可生产肥猪两万五千头
    本报讯　黑龙江省密山垦区永安国营农场，因当地土壤气候等条件有利于播种高产饲料作物，决定扩建为大型养猪场。
    永安农场原为中型谷物农场，养猪事业也较有基础，现有猪近一千头。为了保证人民的肉食需要，现在这个农场正为明年全面发展养猪事业着手编制计划。初步决定：明年开垦荒地五千公顷，连同现有土地共八千公顷，将大部种植饲料作物，预计1958年可生产肥猪两万五千头。喂养及饲料加工，将采用机械或半机械操作。
    农场的工人和领导干部，对于大规模发展养猪事业极为兴奋，他们表示将为正在密山、虎林等地新建的养猪场起示范作用。现在，这个场已派出一批职工前往林区伐木；预计在解冻以前可伐木五千立方公尺，用以修建三万平方公尺的猪舍和附属房屋。养猪模范李永秉将为农场训练大批饲养员。
