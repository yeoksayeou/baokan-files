　　A Visit to Tunisia
　　Li Xuechun
　  (IV) Streets of Tunis
    On the afternoon of August 6th, we were settled by Tunisian young friends in a French hotel in Tunis, and then they immediately took us to visit the city of Tunis.
    Tunis is divided into two parts - the European district and the Arab district.
    The European district is exceptionally bustling, but the shops, larger hotels, and cars running on the streets are all French.
    The Arab district forms a sharp contrast to the European district, with its medieval-style buildings, streets that cannot accommodate three or five people walking side by side, the clanging sounds from handicraft workshops, the cries of street vendors, the stench from open-air puddles, and the endless stream of beggars and unemployed workers. Out of the 3.5 million people in Tunisia, 500,000 are unemployed, and most of these unemployed are young people.
    A Tunisian friend told me: "This is the result of the long-term rule of French colonialism." He pointed to a row of short, dirty little houses and said, "These were built by the French for Tunisian civil servants to live in." He pointed to a row of white three-story buildings and said, "These were built by the Tunisian people themselves after independence."
    We witnessed the new atmosphere of Tunisia after independence. The Place de la Résidence Générale in the city center was renamed Independence Square, where the Tunisian flag flew, replacing the French tricolor. Before independence, the Tunisian flag was placed between two French flags on the streets of Tunis, which was said to symbolize that Tunisia was a French "protectorate"; now one can still see three national flags on the streets, but these are the flags of Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. Tunisian friends explained that this symbolizes the unity of the three North African countries in their struggle to get rid of French colonial rule. The former French Residence became the French Embassy in Tunisia; many former French colonial institutions became Tunisian government agencies. Many French colonialists, under the impact of the wave of national independence movements, were uneasy, and some had already begun to transfer their funds in Tunisia.
    The Tunisian people have stood up! The young Tunisia is changing its face.
　  (V) Bardo Square
    On August 7th, we visited Bardo Square.
    Bardo Square is located in the northern suburbs of Tunis, and north of the square is a beautiful seaside resort. The hot wind from the Sahara Desert swept over the square, and the golden thorns of wild figs glittered in the sun. The Tunisian flag replaced the French tricolor, flying over the square.
    Mentioning Bardo Square reminds people of the Treaty of Bardo and the history of blood and tears of the Tunisian people who were reduced to French colonies. From 1837, French imperialists used various excuses to invade Tunisia; on April 20, 1881, French colonial troops invaded Tunisia. The Tunisian people bravely resisted this brutal invasion, and after sixteen days of bloody fighting, the Tunisian people were temporarily defeated due to being outnumbered. The then King of Tunisia signed the shameful Treaty of Bardo with France. Since then, Tunisia has become a protectorate of French imperialism.
    However, the Tunisian people did not recognize this traitorous treaty, and they continued to fight bravely to drive out French imperialism and fight for national independence. For decades, the blood of countless Tunisian patriots has been shed in Bardo Square. Tunisian labor leader Farhat Hached was executed in Bardo Square by French executioners in 1952 for leading Tunisian workers in resisting French colonialism. When he was martyred, he shouted, "Long live Tunisian independence!" Four hundred guerrillas from Griba, holding high the banner of abolishing the Treaty of Bardo, attacked the local French garrison on July 14 of the same year, killing fourteen French soldiers. Throughout Tunisia, about six thousand young people formed an anti-French guerrilla force, which was often active in the scorching Sahara Desert in the south, constantly attacking the French garrisons stationed there.
    On March 20th of this year, the French flag disappeared from Bardo Square, and the Tunisian flag was raised on the square. Tunisia is independent, and the Tunisian people's songs of freedom are flying over Bardo Square. (Attached picture)

　　突尼斯访问记
　　李学纯
　  （四）突尼斯市的街头
    8月6日下午，我们被突尼斯的青年朋友们安顿在突尼斯市的一家法国旅馆里，然后，他们立刻带着我们去游览突尼斯市容。
    突尼斯市分为两个部分——欧洲市区和阿拉伯市区。
    欧洲市区异常繁华，但是那里的商店、较大一些的旅馆以及街上跑的汽车都是法国的。
    阿拉伯区则与欧洲区形成鲜明的对照，这里有着中世纪的古式建筑，三、五个人不能并排行走的街道，这里充满着手工业作坊发出的铿锵声，小贩的叫卖声，露天水坑发出的臭气，络绎不绝的流浪街头的乞丐和失业工人。在突尼斯三百五十万人口中，就有五十万人失业，而且这些失业者大部都是青年人。
    一位突尼斯朋友告诉我：“这是法国殖民主义者长期统治的结果。”他指着一排又矮又脏的小房子说：“这是法国人造来给突尼斯公务人员住的。”他又指着一排白色的三层楼房说：“这是独立后突尼斯人民自己建造的。”
    我们亲眼看到了突尼斯独立后的新气象。市中心的法国总督府广场改名为独立广场，这个广场上，飘扬着突尼斯的国旗，代替了法国的三色旗。独立以前的突尼斯街头上，突尼斯的国旗被插在两面法国旗的中间，据说这象征着突尼斯是法国的“保护国”；现在人们在街头上还能看到三面国旗，但是这是突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥的国旗。突尼斯朋友们解释说：这是北非三个国家为摆脱法国的殖民统治而团结起来共同奋斗的象征。过去的法国总督府改成了法国驻突尼斯大使馆；过去的许多法国殖民机关，改成了突尼斯政府的机关。许多法国殖民主义分子，在民族独立运动的浪潮冲击下惶惶不安，有的已开始转移在突尼斯的资金。
    突尼斯人民站起来了！青年的突尼斯正在改变着它的面貌。
　  （五）巴图广场
    8月7日，我们游览了巴图广场。
    巴图广场位于突尼斯市北郊，广场北边就是优美的海滨避暑地了。撒哈拉沙漠的热风从广场上空掠过，野无花果的金色小刺，在太阳下闪闪发光。突尼斯的国旗代替了法国的三色旗，飘扬在广场的上空。
    提起巴图广场，人们就想到巴图条约，连想到突尼斯人民沦为法国殖民地的血泪史。从1837年起，法帝国主义者便利用种种借口向突尼斯进行侵略；1881年4月20日，法国的殖民军队侵入了突尼斯。对于这种残暴的侵略，突尼斯人民进行了英勇的抵抗，经过了十六天的浴血苦战，突尼斯人民终以寡不敌众暂告失败。当时的突尼斯国王与法国签订了可耻的巴图条约。从此，突尼斯就变成了法帝国主义的保护国。
    但是，突尼斯人民并没有承认这一卖国条约，他们为赶走法帝国主义、争取民族独立而继续英勇战斗。几十年来，不知有多少突尼斯爱国者的鲜血洒在巴图广场上。突尼斯工人领袖法哈·哈士德由于领导突尼斯工人反抗法国殖民主义者，于1952年被法国刽子手处死在巴图广场上。当他就义的时候，还高呼：“突尼斯独立万岁！”格里比亚的四百名游击队员，高举着废除巴图条约的大旗，于同年7月14日袭击了当地的法国驻军，击毙法军十四名。在全突尼斯，约有六千青年组成了抗法游击队，这支游击队，经常活跃在南方酷热的撒哈拉沙漠上，向盘踞在当地的法国驻军不断出击。
    今年3月20日，巴图广场上的法国国旗消失了，广场上升起了突尼斯国旗。突尼斯独立了，突尼斯人民自由的歌声飘扬在巴图广场的上空。（附图片）
