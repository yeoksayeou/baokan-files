　　The CPC Fuzhou Municipal Committee Implements Spirit of Second Plenary Session
　　Decides to Launch Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign Throughout City
    (Our Dispatch) The CPC Fuzhou Municipal Committee convened a conference of cadres from the industrial and transportation systems from November 30th to December 3rd. In accordance with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Party, it decided to launch an increase production and practice economy campaign in all factories and enterprises throughout the city. After reviewing the plan implementation of various factories and enterprises, the conference emphasized that many cadres in factories and enterprises currently harbor ideas of extravagance and waste, believing that everything should be done with pomp and grandeur. This idea is reflected in capital construction as a blind pursuit of automation and mechanization, and in production as only caring about completing production targets without regard for economic accounting. Some people even emphasize that making new products requires new factories and new equipment. Handicraft factories newly converted from cooperatives want to emulate industrial factories, joint state-private enterprises want to emulate state-owned factories, and small factories want to emulate large factories. The conference criticized this thinking, and after serious discussion, reversed this fondness for the new and greed for the large. The conference then focused on discussing the principle of increasing production and practicing economy, emphasizing the need to earnestly improve leadership style, oppose subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, and prevent one-sidedness. At the meeting, many factories calculated their increase production and practice economy accounts and proposed measures for increasing production and practicing economy. The Fuzhou Paper Mill and Pharmaceutical Factory proposed to increase production by 5% in December without increasing personnel costs, by utilizing saved materials to exceed production targets. The more than twenty factories directly under the Municipal Industry Bureau will strive to increase production by 10.4% compared to the original plan in December. Among them, twelve factories alone can increase production and save the state 178,000 yuan in December. All factories and enterprises also guarantee to practice strict budgeting in all aspects, save raw materials, and reduce management expenses by 5%.

　  中共福州市委贯彻二中全会精神
　　决定在全市开展增产节约运动
    本报讯　中共福州市委于11月30日到12月3日召开了工业交通系统干部会议，根据党的二中全会精神，决定在全市工厂企业中开展增产节约运动。会议在检查了各工厂企业的计划执行情况后，着重指出，目前不少工厂企业干部中滋长了铺张浪费思想，认为事事可讲究排场阔气。这种思想反映在基本建设上是一味追求自动化机械化，在生产方面是只管完成产量计划不问经济核算。有些人更强调做新产品就要新厂房新设备。刚从合作社转来的手工业工厂要向工业工厂看齐，公私合营工厂要向国营厂看齐，小厂要向大厂看齐。会议针对这种思想进行了批评，经过大家认真讨论，扭转了这种喜新贪大的思想。会议接着又着重讨论了增产节约的方针，强调要切实改进领导作风，反对主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，防止片面性。会上许多工厂算了增产节约帐，提出了增产节约的措施。福州造纸厂和制药厂提出12月份在不增加人员费用的条件下，利用节约下来的材料，超额增产5％。市工业局直属的二十多个厂，12月份要争取比原计划增产10.4％。其中十二个厂仅12月份就可为国家增产节约十七万八千元。所有工厂企业并保证做到处处精打细算，节约原材料，减少管理费5％。
