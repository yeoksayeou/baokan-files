Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 4th: The Jiangxi Province recently held a grain production technology conference to review and summarize the experiences and lessons of agricultural technology reform in the province this year.

The conference pointed out that the "Three Transformations" promoted in Jiangxi Province in recent years, with the transformation of one crop per year into two crops as the main content, has proven to be an effective method for increasing grain production. This year, two million mu of medium rice was changed to early rice, and a bumper harvest was generally obtained. At the same time, the sowing period of autumn crops on these lands was earlier than in the past, and the yield of autumn crops in areas with less autumn drought was also increased. However, some deviations also occurred in the implementation of the "Three Transformations" this year. For example, some areas expanded the planting of double-cropping rice too much, regardless of conditions such as water conservancy, labor, and animal power. A small number of cold paddy fields that were not suitable for double-cropping rice were converted to double-cropping rice. After the early rice harvest in some areas, the original habit of replanting high-yielding soybeans and sweet potatoes was changed to late rice this year. These have caused certain losses. Some areas have made mistakes of coercion and command in improving agricultural technology. For example, when Ruijin County promoted appropriate close planting, it insisted on a row spacing of seven or eight inches, regardless of specific conditions such as soil quality and whether or not the seedlings were sufficient. Cadres held rulers in one hand and ropes in the other, and ordered those that did not meet the standard to be pulled up and replanted. As a result, production losses were caused by insufficient seedlings and delayed transplanting. In addition, some areas have widely promoted cultivation experiences that have only been successfully tested on small plots of land without conducting key experiments. Some agricultural technicians did not consult with the masses, were self-righteous, and tried to be innovative. These have also caused production losses.

After reviewing these situations, the meeting believed that the "Three Transformations" should still be actively promoted next year to improve land utilization; however, subjectivism must be overcome to prevent blind and chaotic transformations. In promoting the "Three Transformations," it is necessary to comprehensively consider local natural conditions, water conservancy facilities, fertilizer sources, labor and animal power arrangements, original cultivation habits, the size of the income, and whether the masses are willing, and it is necessary to resolutely implement the principle of adapting to local conditions. In agricultural technology guidance work, on the one hand, the spirit of active work and hard study should be promoted, and on the other hand, errors such as coercion and command must be resolutely corrected.

After review and discussion, the meeting formulated the main points of agricultural technology guidance for Jiangxi Province in 1957.

　  江西粮食生产技术会议作出总结
　　“三变”确是增产的有效办法
　　但必须因地制宜坚决纠正强迫命令作风
    新华社南昌4日电　江西省最近举行粮食生产技术会议，检查和总结了今年全省农业技术改革的经验和教训。
    这次会议指出，江西省几年来推行以变一季为两季为主要内容的
  “三变”，已经证明是增产粮食的有效办法。今年全省有两百万亩中稻改种早稻，普遍获得了丰收。同时，这些土地上秋季作物播种期比过去提早，在秋旱较轻地区秋季作物的产量也有提高。但是今年推行“三变”中也出现了一些偏差。如有的地区不顾水利、劳力、畜力等条件，过多地扩种双季稻。少数地区不适宜种双季稻的冷浆田，改种了双季稻。有的地区早稻收割以后，原来习惯于复种产量高的大豆、红薯，今年却改种了晚稻。这些都造成了一定的损失。有的地区在改进农业技术方面出现了强迫命令的错误做法。如瑞金县在推行适当密植的时候，不分土质好坏、秧苗够不够等具体条件，硬要一律做到七、八寸株行距。干部一手拿尺，一手拿绳，不合规定标准的就勒令拔起重插。结果，由于秧苗不够和插秧延迟，造成了减产损失。此外，有的地区把只在小块地上初步试种成功的耕作栽培经验，不经过重点试验就普遍推广。有的农业技术干部不和群众商量，自以为是，标新立异。这些也都造成了减产损失。
    会议检查了这些情况，认为明年仍然应当积极推行“三变”，以提高土地利用率；但是必须克服主观主义，防止盲目乱变。在推行“三变”中，必须要全面考虑当地的自然条件、水利设施、肥料来源、劳力和畜力安排、原来栽培习惯、收益大小以及群众是否自愿等各方面，要坚决贯彻因地制宜的原则。在农业技术指导工作中，一方面应当提倡积极工作，刻苦钻研的精神，另一方面必须坚决纠正强迫命令等错误作法。
    经过检查和讨论，会议制定了江西省1957年农业技术指导要点。
