    The Dead Are Responsible for the Living
    The Zhangjing District Party branch in Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, was holding a general meeting of party members one day to discuss a comrade's application for Party membership. One of the comrade's sponsors had recently passed away. At the time, some people suggested that a new sponsor should be appointed, but the branch secretary insisted: "The dead can also be a sponsor!"
    The sponsor is responsible for the person being introduced. May I ask this branch secretary, how can the dead be responsible for the living? (Li Si)

    死人对活人负责
    江苏无锡县张泾区机关党支部，一天开党员大会讨论一个同志的入党问题。这位同志的入党介绍人之一，不久前去世了。当时有人提出应重换一个介绍人，但支部书记却坚持说：“死人也可以当介绍人！”
    介绍人是要对被介绍人负责的。请问这位支部书记，死人如何对活人负责？（李驷）
