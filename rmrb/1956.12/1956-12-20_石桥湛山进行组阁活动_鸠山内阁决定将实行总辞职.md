Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 19th: Tanzan Ishibashi, the newly elected president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, has begun activities to form a new cabinet.

The Hatoyama cabinet decided yesterday to resign en masse when the regular Diet session convenes on the 20th. Ishibashi, the designated successor, plans to form a new cabinet in a day or two.

Ishibashi has already consulted with some elders of the ruling party on the basic principles of cabinet formation and party personnel arrangements. They decided in principle to change the current cabinet members and party leaders; to prevent non-party members from participating in the cabinet; and to attach importance to the positions of Minister of Finance and Minister of Foreign Affairs, especially to appoint figures who can reflect Ishibashi's active ideas.

Ishibashi has repeatedly emphasized the need to eliminate factional struggles within the party in cabinet formation and party personnel matters. However, in reality, he is being constrained by factional infighting. According to Kyodo News, because various factions within the ruling party are vying for new cabinet positions and party leadership positions, cabinet formation activities will not proceed smoothly. Ishibashi finds it most difficult to decide how to place Nobusuke Kishi and Mitsujiro Ishii, who once competed with him for the presidency.

The Kishi Nobusuke faction, which has nearly half of the members of the House of Representatives, demands that important cabinet positions and party leadership positions be distributed in proportion to the number of members. However, some people from the former Progressive Party faction and the Yoshida faction have expressed opposition. At present, Ishibashi is continuing to negotiate with the leaders of various factions.

    石桥湛山进行组阁活动
    鸠山内阁决定将实行总辞职
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本执政的自由民主党新任总裁石桥湛山已经开始进行组织新内阁的活动。
    鸠山内阁在昨天已经决定在20日召开国会平时会议的时候，实行总辞职。内定的继任者石桥准备在一两天以后组成新内阁。
    石桥已经同执政党的一些元老们商谈了组阁和党内人事的基本方针。他们决定原则上要更动现任阁员和党的领导干部；不让党外人士参加内阁；重视大藏（财政）大臣和外务大臣两个职位，特别要任用能够反映石桥的积极想法的人物。
    石桥一再强调在组阁和党内人事问题上要消除党内派系之争。但是，实际上他正在受派系斗争的牵制。据共同社说，由于执政党内各派都想争夺新阁员职位和党内领导干部职位，组阁活动不会顺利进展。石桥对于怎样安置曾经和他竞选总裁的岸信介、石井光次郎最为困难。
    岸信介派在众议院拥有将近一半的议员，要求按议员比例分配重要的阁员职位和党内领导干部职位。但是，前改进党系和吉田派的一些人表示反对。目前，石桥正在继续同各派的首脑人物进行折冲。
