Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 16th. Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government Minister of Agriculture, Dögéi, held a press conference on December 14th to introduce Hungary's current agricultural situation and the government's measures.

Dögéi said that Hungarian farmers have taken a positive attitude towards the establishment of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government. The countryside has remained peaceful. Since the government abolished the compulsory purchase system, the farmers' moods have also been stable in recent weeks.

Dögéi said that most of the agricultural production cooperatives have withstood this test. About 40% of the cooperatives have been dissolved, most of which were newly established cooperatives, cooperatives that did not adhere to the principle of voluntarism when they were established in the past, or some cooperatives that were poorly managed. In addition, some cooperatives were dissolved under the threat of counter-revolutionary elements.

The minister said: Reports are now constantly being received from the countryside that some cooperatives that were forcibly dissolved by counter-revolutionary elements are now being re-established. For example, after the October 23rd incident, farmers in 113 villages in Szolnok County withdrew from the cooperatives, but by December 1st, 49 villages had re-established cooperatives.

Dögéi then talked about the main issues in the government's plans in agriculture. He said that only by reorganizing industry and laying a new foundation in agriculture can Hungary break free from its current difficult situation. If agricultural production is not increased, it will be impossible to raise living standards in the coming years. Therefore, the government's plan stipulates slowing down the pace of industrial development so that the government can transfer workers from enterprises to agriculture. Dögéi pointed out that the government believes that farmers should have complete freedom in choosing their management methods and that it is also important to help individual farmers. However, the government's support for individual farmers does not mean that the government will not actively engage in the development of the cooperative movement. Dögéi said that the government will continue to support the development of cooperatives in the future, especially providing assistance to all farmers who are willing to establish good and prosperous production cooperatives.

Dögéi pointed out that machine tractor stations will continue to exist. In addition, each production cooperative will be enabled to purchase large agricultural machines, even tractors. At the same time, the government also plans to produce small agricultural machines for individual farmers.

Dögéi finally said that in order to improve farmers' production sentiment and make the entire agriculture prosper, the government will replace the abolished compulsory purchase system with national purchase and production contracts. The government also supports the free buying and selling of land, of course, this requires setting certain limits to prevent the re-emergence of large estates. The government will also abolish the State Farm Department, and its work will be taken over by the Ministry of Agriculture.

    匈牙利农业部长介绍农业情况
    农民情绪稳定纷纷重建合作社
    将放慢工业发展速度，增加农业生产
    新华社布达佩斯16日电　匈牙利工农革命政府农业部长德盖伊在12月14日举行记者招待会，介绍了匈牙利目前的农业情况和政府的措施。
    德盖伊说，匈牙利农民对工农革命政府的成立采取了肯定的态度。农村一直保持着安宁。由于政府废除了义务征购制，农民的情绪在最近几周内也是稳定的。
    德盖伊说，大多数的农业生产合作社都经住了这次考验。已经解散的合作社大约占40％，其中大多是新建的社和在过去建立的时候没有遵守自愿原则的合作社，或者是经营得不好的一些合作社。另外还有一些合作社是在反革命分子的威胁下解散的。
    这位部长说：现在从农村不断接到报告说，曾经被反革命分子强迫解散的一些合作社现在又重新建立起来了。例如，在10月23日事件发生以后，索尔诺克州有一百一十三个村庄的合作社的农民退出了合作社，但是到12月1日，已经有四十九个村庄又重新建立了合作社。
    德盖伊随后谈到政府在农业方面的计划中的主要问题。他说，只有与工业进行改组的同时，在农业方面也打下一个新的基础，匈牙利才能够从它现在所处的困难局势中挣脱出来。如果不增加农业生产，就不可能在今后几年内提高生活水平。因此政府的计划规定放慢工业发展的速度，这样政府就能够把工人从企业中转移到农业方面去。德盖伊指出，政府认为应当让农民在选择经营方式方面有完全的自由，并且认为帮助个体农民也是很重要的。但是，政府将支持个体农民，这并不是说政府就不积极从事合作化运动的发展了。德盖伊说，政府今后仍然支持合作社的发展，特别是对一切愿意建立好的、繁荣的生产合作社的农民给予援助。
    德盖伊指出，机器拖拉机站将继续存在。此外，将使每个生产合作社有可能购买大型农业机器，甚至拖拉机。同时，政府也计划为个体农民生产小型农业机器。
    德盖伊最后说，为了提高农民生产情绪和使整个农业繁荣起来，政府将以国家征购和生产合同的方式来代替已被取消的义务征购制。政府也赞成土地自由买卖，当然这需要规定某种界限，以防止大庄园的重新产生。政府还将取消国营农场部，它的工作将由农业部来接管。
