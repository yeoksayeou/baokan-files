    Introduction to Arts and Crafts

    Bamboo Weaving Craft
    Bamboo grows extensively in the southern provinces of China, providing an inexhaustible source of raw materials for bamboo weaving. The bamboo weaving craft in Zhejiang Province started very early. The wickerwork objects unearthed recently at Qianshanyang, Wuxing, Zhejiang, prove that our ancestors were using bamboo to make utensils around 3000 BC.
    Bamboo woven crafts are light and inexpensive, so they are widely used as household and production utensils. The most famous bamboo weaving crafts in Zhejiang are in Dongyang, Shengxian, and Shaoxing. Now there are bamboo weaving craft production cooperatives organized in the local areas. The "Yuanbao Basket" and "Fruit Box" produced by the Dongyang Bamboo Weaving Craft Production Cooperative are more beautiful and exquisite than the original folk bamboo weaving utensils in terms of shape, color, and weaving techniques. Their bamboo screens are developed from the original bamboo door curtains. They can weave more than one hundred round bamboo strips within one inch of space, or weave patterns of flowers, birds, and animals with thin-as-paper flat bamboo strips, or interweave bamboo strips into various "eye patterns," giving full play to the characteristics of the bamboo weaving craft. Their products have participated in various overseas arts and crafts exhibitions and have won high praise from international friends.

    竹编工艺
    竹子普遍生长在我国南方各省，它提供了竹编工艺以无限丰富的原料。浙江的竹编工艺开始得很早，最近在浙江吴兴钱山漾发掘所得新石器时代的篾编物，证明在公元前三千年左右，我们的祖先就利用竹子制造用具了。
    竹编工艺品轻便、价廉，所以被广泛利用作生活和生产用具。浙江的竹编工艺以东阳、嵊县、绍兴等地为最著名。现在当地都有竹编工艺生产合作社的组织。东阳竹编工艺生产合作社制作的“元宝篮”、“果盒”等，在造型上、色彩上、编制技术上，比原有的民间竹编用具更优美精巧了；他们的竹屏风就是从原有的竹门帘发展而来的。他们可以在一寸阔的地位内编一百多根圆篾丝，或用薄似纸片的扁篾丝编出花鸟动物等图案，或用篾丝交织成各种“眼纹”，充分发挥了篾编工艺的特色。他们的出品，曾参加历次出国的工艺品展览会，获得国际友人很高的评价。
