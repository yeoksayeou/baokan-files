Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: The Chiang Kai-shek group is forcibly demolishing homes in various towns and cities in Taiwan, leaving many people homeless and even driven to suicide, causing widespread dissatisfaction and resistance among Taiwanese residents. According to Taiwan newspapers, the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Taiwan Provincial Government," facing many difficulties in forcibly demolishing homes in various counties and cities, recently issued an "instruction" stipulating that Chiang Kai-shek group police and officials would "not be held criminally liable" for suicide or death resulting from the forced demolition of homes; if residents obstruct or resist demolition, they should be arrested and sent to court for punishment under the "crime of obstructing official duties."

Due to poverty, many Taiwanese residents build shacks out of bamboo, wood, and straw on open land and riverbanks in towns and cities for shelter. These shacks are ubiquitous, affecting the Chiang Kai-shek group's large-scale requisition of land in Taiwan for military use and its sale of real estate to amass wealth, and are also considered "detrimental to the appearance for our American friends." Therefore, under the guise of "banning illegal buildings," the Chiang Kai-shek group recklessly demolishes these shacks, regardless of the lives of Taiwanese residents. In Taipei City, with a population of over 600,000, there are approximately 30,000 such shacks inhabited by poor people. The Chiang Kai-shek group's county and city governments in Taiwan have established "illegal building demolition brigades" specifically responsible for the forced demolition of homes. Personnel from the demolition brigades often extort money from poor people threatened with demolition.

Taiwan newspapers say that the Chiang Kai-shek group is not only forcibly demolishing these shacks, but also some brick houses are not spared.

This measure of harming residents by the Chiang Kai-shek group has caused widespread dissatisfaction and resistance among residents. Incidents of assaulting demolition police and officials occur frequently in Taiwan. Not long ago, when police and officials in Kaohsiung City went to demolish seven "illegal buildings" in the city, residents brought out four coffins inside the houses, preparing to resist with their lives. The "Illegal Building Demolition Brigade" of Taipei County recently went to Zhonghe Township to forcibly demolish homes and were surrounded by angry residents who wanted to disarm them, scaring them away without demolishing any houses. Later, many residents were arrested.

### 蒋介石集团在台湾强拆民房

　　蒋介石集团在台湾强拆民房
    新华社8日讯　蒋介石集团在台湾各市镇强拆民房，弄得许多人流离失所甚至自杀，引起台湾居民普遍的不满和反抗。据台湾报纸说，最近蒋介石集团“台湾省政府”由于各县市在强拆民房时发生许多困难，竟发出一个“指示”，规定蒋介石集团警察和官员因强拆民房而造成受害人自杀死亡等后果，都“不负刑法上的责任”；居民如果阻挠或抗拒拆屋，应以“妨害公务罪”逮捕押往法院处罚。
    台湾居民由于生活贫困，许多人都在市镇的空旷土地上和河边用竹、木、干草等盖起棚户栖身。这些棚户到处林立，使蒋介石集团在台湾大量征用土地作为军用地段和出卖地产搜刮钱财受到影响，而且也被认为是“有碍美国友人的观瞻”。因此蒋介石集团在“取缔违章建筑”的名义下，不顾台湾居民的死活，疯狂加以拆除。在六十多万人口的台北市，这种穷人居住的棚户就约有三万户。蒋介石集团台湾各县市政府都设有“取缔违章建筑大队”，专门负责强拆民房的工作。拆屋大队的人员常常向遭受拆屋威胁的贫民敲诈勒索。
    台湾报纸说，蒋介石集团不光是强拆这些棚户，有些砖屋也不能幸免。
    蒋介石集团这种祸害居民的措施，引起居民普遍不满和反抗。殴打拆屋警察和官员的事件，在台湾经常发生。不久前，高雄市的警察和官员往拆市内的七户“违章建筑”时，居民们就在屋内抬出四口棺材，准备以死相抗。台北县的“拆除违章建筑大队”最近到中和乡强拆民房，被愤怒的居民包围，要把他们缴械，吓得他们不敢动手拆屋就逃去，后来，有居民多人被捕。
