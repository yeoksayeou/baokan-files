　　American Taxpayers' Unexpected Burden
　　On January 17, 1950, the Brink's Trust Company in Boston, USA, was robbed of $1,219,000 by a group of robbers.
　　However, the biggest losers in this robbery were not the company itself, but all the taxpayers in Boston, Mississippi, and the United States as a whole. According to the "Boston Globe," the FBI spent about $2.5 million to solve the case in more than six years, and the state, county, and city governments spent about $2 million on the crime. Finally, the trial of these robbers cost another $150,000 in forty-four days.
　　Prisons Overcrowded
　　The British colonial authorities are frantically suppressing the Cypriot people's movement to unite with Greece in Cyprus, arresting a large number of Greek Cypriot residents, so that prisons are overcrowded and there is a lack of management. Recently, the British "Evening Standard" published a small advertisement for the British government to recruit "Cyprus prison and detention camp administrators." The advertisement said: "The contract is for a fixed term of one year, renewable upon expiration."
　　"Dishonorable" Metropolitan Resident
　　Not long ago, Colonel H.E. Scheetz, Chief of Intelligence of the US Air Force Base in Tachikawa, Japan, received the title of "Honorary Metropolitan Resident" and a letter of appreciation from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for his "meritorious service in promoting Japan-US friendship."
　　This incident immediately aroused great indignation among the people of Tachikawa. They said that this colonel was engaged in espionage activities, and was an enemy of the Japanese people. He was not worthy of being an "Honorary Metropolitan Resident" of Tokyo at all; if he were to be given the title of "Metropolitan Resident," it could only be a "Dishonorable Metropolitan Resident"!

　　美国纳税人的意外负担
    1950年1月17日，美国波士顿城的布林克信托分公司被一群盗匪抢走了一百二十一万九千美元。
    但是，由于这一抢劫案而遭到最大损失的并不是这家公司，而是波士顿市的、密士失必州的和美国全国的所有纳税人。因为据“波士顿寰球报”的估计，六年多来，美国联邦调查局为破获这个案子用了约二百五十万美元，州、郡和市的政府为这个罪案用去了约二百万美元。最后，在审讯这批盗匪的四十四天中，又用去了十五万美元。
    监狱人满为患
    英国殖民当局在塞浦路斯疯狂地镇压塞浦路斯人民争取归并希腊的运动，大量逮捕塞浦路斯的希腊籍居民，以致监狱人满为患、管理乏人。最近英国“标准晚报”刊载了一则英政府招聘“塞浦路斯监狱、拘留营管理员”的小广告。广告说：“合同定期为一年，期满可以续订”。
    “不名誉的”都民
    不久以前，日本立川美军基地情报部长H·E·谢兹上校，曾因“致力日美亲善有功”，接受了东京都授给他的“名誉都民”称号和感谢状。
    这椿事情立即引起了立川人民的万分愤慨。他们说，这个上校干的是特务勾当，是日本人民的敌人，根本不配作东京都的“名誉都民”；如果要给他以“都民”的称号，也只能是“不名誉的都民”！
