Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 14th - According to a report in the "People's Freedom" newspaper on the 11th, an armed counter-revolutionary riot recently occurred in Salgótarján, a border city in northeastern Hungary near Czechoslovakia.

On the morning of December 8th, the Salgótarján police station arrested counter-revolutionary elements Gál Lajos, who was distributing reactionary leaflets and inciting strikes among coal miners, and Vígh Tibor, an escaped prisoner who had been sentenced to twelve years for organizing fascist armed forces. At this time, counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the state workers' committee and factory workers' committees took the opportunity to act. They telephoned enterprises and factories in the city and nearby, inciting strikes.

Some factories saw the appearance of people who had never worked there, shouting, "Whoever doesn't go out and march is a bad egg." Many factory workers were forced into the streets. In some places, those who did not want to march were spat upon or beaten. Miners who wanted to go home were coerced by counter-revolutionary elements to the location of the march.

Nearly two thousand people gathered in front of the state parliament building and the nearby police station. Hidden counter-revolutionary elements shouted slogans vilifying the government, the People's Security Forces, and the Soviet army. At this time, a representative of the state police station repeatedly called on the masses to disperse, leaving five people to negotiate, and guaranteed that these five people would not be harmed. However, the masses, whose path was blocked by cars and trucks, could not disperse. The counter-revolutionary elements hiding behind them, that is, opposite the state parliament building, took the opportunity to open fire, and then strafed the masses with machine guns from behind, throwing hand grenades at the People's Security Forces. The People's Security Forces had not yet returned fire at that time. Only after the counter-revolutionary elements began firing with light machine guns did the Hungarian People's Security Forces and the Soviet army reluctantly fire warning shots first. Only after the counter-revolutionary elements did not stop firing did they return fire.

In this incident, the counter-revolutionary elements caused several deaths and hundreds of injuries.

Xinhua News Agency, December 14th - TASS, Budapest, December 13th: After the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic promulgated a decree requiring civilians to immediately hand over weapons in their possession to the Hungarian authorities, police stations and military officer protection groups in Budapest and other cities across the country have received large quantities of rifles, submachine guns, pistols, hand grenades, bullets, shells, and other various weapons and ammunition. For example, in Heves County, more than two thousand various types of weapons were handed over to the authorities in a single day.

Since the elimination of the counter-revolutionary armed rebellion, the Hungarian army has discovered and collected more than twenty carloads of various ammunition in houses, gardens, parks, and children's playgrounds, etc.

    粉碎反革命分子的绝望挣扎
    匈牙利镇压一起武装暴乱
    各地警察局收到民间缴出的大量武器
    新华社布达佩斯14日电　据“人民自由报”11日报道，在布达佩斯东北紧靠捷克斯洛伐克附近的边境城市萨尔戈塔尔颜最近曾经发生了一次反革命的武装暴乱。
    12月8日早上，萨尔戈塔尔颜警察局逮捕了散发反动传单和在煤矿工人中煽动罢工的反革命分子加尔劳约什和曾因组织法西斯武装被判处十二年徒刑的在逃犯维·蒂保尔。这时，隐藏在州工人委员会和工厂工人委员会的反革命分子，便乘机活动。他们打电话给市内和附近的企业和工厂，煽动罢工。
    一些工厂出现了一些从来也没有在那儿工作过的人，他们大喊大叫，“谁不出去游行，就是坏蛋。”许多工厂的工人都被强迫到街上去。有些地方，不愿出去游行的人就被吐痰或挨打。想回家的矿工被反革命分子胁迫着载到游行的地点。
    在州议会楼房前与附近的警察局前，集合了将近二千人。隐藏的反革命分子喊着诬蔑政府、公安军和苏军的口号。这时，州警察局的一个代表多次叫群众散开，留下五个人来进行谈判，并且保证这五个人不会出什么事故。但道路上被汽车和载重汽车堵塞着的群众不能散开，躲在他们背后的、也即州议会对面的反革命分子趁机开枪射击，接着又从背后向群众扫射机关枪，向公安军掷手榴弹。公安军那时还没有还枪，直至反革命分子开始用轻机枪扫射，匈牙利公安军和苏军被迫先放了警告枪，反革命分子还不停火后，才向他们回射。
    在这次事件中，反革命分子造成了数人死亡和成百人受伤。
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯13日讯：在匈牙利人民共和国主席团颁布了关于民间持有的武器须立刻缴给匈牙利政权机关的法令以后，布达佩斯和全国其他城市的警察局和军官保卫团收到了大量步枪、冲锋枪、手枪、手榴弹、子弹、炮弹以及其他各种武器和弹药。例如，在赫威斯州一天内就向政权机关缴出了两千多件各种各样的武器。
    匈牙利军队从消灭了反革命武装叛乱起一直到目前，在房屋里、庭园里、公园里以及在儿童体育场等等地方，已经查出和收集了二十多车皮的各种弹药。
