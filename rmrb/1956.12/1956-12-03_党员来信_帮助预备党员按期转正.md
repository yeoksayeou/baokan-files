Letters from Party Members
　　Helping Probationary Party Members Become Full Members on Schedule

    Editor's Note: The three letters from Party members published today illustrate a problem: the work of observing and educating probationary Party members is not being done well within certain Party organizations. They have not followed the provisions of the Party Constitution to conduct serious observation, patient education, and specific assistance to probationary Party members. Only when discussing their becoming full members do they discover various problems and raise various criticisms. Thus, they can only decide to "study further," "observe further," and "educate further." As a result, the issue of some probationary Party members becoming full members is delayed indefinitely. This is clearly irresponsible behavior on the part of those Party organizations and should be corrected.
　　"Cultivation is up to the individual?"
    Editor,
    Currently, many Party organizations do not pay attention to the work of probationary Party members becoming full members, causing some probationary Party members to be unable to become full members on schedule. According to statistics from six counties in the Hejiang area of Heilongjiang Province, out of the existing 1,691 probationary Party members, 350 have not been able to become full members on time. The situation is particularly serious in Fujin County, where 103 out of 156 probationary Party members have had their probationary period extended, with 31 of them extended by one to three years. Tangyuan County recently approved the transfer materials of 22 probationary Party members, all of whom had their probationary periods extended, some by as much as three years, and others by at least half a year.
    One of the main reasons for this phenomenon is that the Party organizations have not grasped the management and education of probationary Party members. Some Party members and Party organizations mistakenly believe that once a person joins the Party, everything is fine. They say: "The master leads you through the door, cultivation is up to the individual." In this way, the Party organization cannot combine practical work to assign specific people to educate and help probationary Party members. Coupled with unsound organizational life, probationary Party members do not receive more education and training after joining the Party. Some people cannot become full members after their term expires, and therefore feel depressed and uneasy. Shi Chengjin, a new Party member from Wanqing Township, Tangyuan County, said: Before joining the Party, people often talked to me, but after joining the Party, no one looks for me anymore. I feel that there is not much difference between before and after joining the Party, and there is no progress. This shows how eagerly comrades who have just joined the Party need the guidance and help of the Party organization, and how important it is to do a good job in the management and education of probationary Party members for consolidating the Party organization. Therefore, I suggest that Party organizations at all levels strengthen this work and educate and cultivate all probationary Party members into full Party members who meet the requirements of the Party Constitution, in order to enhance the Party's role as a fighting fortress.

　　Why Delayed for More Than Five Years?
    Editor,
    Comrade Li Zhenpeng joined the Party in the seventh district of Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, in April 1950, with a probationary period of half a year. However, due to delays by relevant Party organizations, he did not complete the procedures for becoming a full member until August of this year, a delay of five years and ten months.
    What exactly caused Li Zhenpeng's transfer to be delayed for so long?
    Five months after joining the Party, Li Zhenpeng submitted a request to the township branch to become a full member. The reply at the time was: "Wait until after the Party rectification." This dragged on for three years.
    In July 1953, Li Zhenpeng came to a construction site of the First Construction Engineering Company of Wuhan City as a temporary worker with a letter of introduction for probationary Party members. During his year and a half of work at this company, he wrote fifteen applications to become a full member, but no one ever paid attention to them. In September 1954, he participated in the flood control struggle in Wuhan City, working at a construction site in the first work section. Because of his hard work and embodiment of the fine qualities of a Communist Party member, at the end of the flood control effort, the branch meeting unanimously agreed to make him a full member on schedule. However, after reporting to the construction Party committee, the review raised such questions: "Why has Li been delayed for so long in becoming a full member? There may be problems that need to be observed and understood." After inquiring with the CPC Rongcheng County Seventh District Committee, which approved Li's joining the Party, there were no problems. It is unknown why it was delayed again.
    In December 1954, Li went to the Wuhan City Native Products Company as a temporary worker. On the one hand, he worked hard, and on the other hand, he continued to earnestly request the Native Products Company branch to make him a full member. At this time, just as the Party rectification of Wuhan City's commercial system was about to begin, the answer he received was to wait until after the Party rectification. This dragged on for more than half a year. In January 1956, the Party rectification began, and in February, due to the organizational adjustment of the commercial system, the warehouse where Li worked was led by the Qiaokou District Committee. At that time, after investigation and research, it was believed that Li could become a full member. But unfortunately, just after the Party小组discussion passed, Li's Party relationship was transferred back to the original Native Products Company. After some time, Li asked the Party branch officer whether his materials had been transferred from the Qiaokou District Committee. Unexpectedly, the materials were lost, and he did not become a full member until August.

　　Strange Reason
    Editor,
    In December 1952, I joined the Party in the Wenzhou City Bureau of Culture and Education, with a probationary period of six months. In March 1953, I was transferred to work at the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce. At the beginning of July of the same year, I wrote a report applying to become a full member. When the小组 discussed my transfer, among the five people in the group with voting rights, three agreed to the transfer. One person thought that the application report was too simple, and the group leader decided that I should rewrite the report and discuss it again. After that, I wrote three reports in a row, and the小组 thought that the reports were not well written, so they extended my probationary period. The小组 leader also added a reason for the decision to postpone the transfer: "Failure to apply after the deadline, no request to transfer to the Party."
    This reason is very strange. It is clear that the branch discussed my report applying for transfer in 1953, and the小组discussed it even more times. Could it be that the branch committee and the小组 have forgotten what they discussed? Are all five branch committee members so forgetful? No, this is because the branch committees are taking a "none of my business" attitude to the political life of Party members. Moreover, even if a probationary Party member has no political awareness and fails to apply for transfer after the deadline, does the branch just let him fend for himself? This is clearly not in line with the Party's construction policy.
    So far, there are three more probationary Party members in our branch who have exceeded their probationary period by more than a year. The branch should care about the political life of these comrades and earnestly change the bureaucratic work style.

### 党员来信　帮助预备党员按期转正

专栏：

    党员来信
　　帮助预备党员按期转正
    编者按：今天发表的这三封党员来信，说明了一个问题，就是对预备党员的考察教育工作，在某些党组织内还作得很不好。他们并没有按照党章的规定对预备党员进行认真的考察、耐心的教育和具体的帮助，只是到了讨论他们转正的时候，才发现他们有这样那样的问题，提出这样那样的批评，于是只好决定再“研究研究”，再“考察考察”，再“教育教育”。就这样，一些预备党员的转正问题一直拖延不决，这显然是那些党组织不负责任的表现，应该注意改正。
　  “修行在个人”吗？编辑同志：
    目前，有不少党的组织，不重视预备党员的转正工作，致使一些预备党员不能按期转为正式党员。据黑龙江省合江地区六个县的统计，在现有的一千六百九十一名预备党员中，没有能够按时转正的就有三百五十名之多。比较严重的是富锦县，一百五十六名预备党员，就有一百零三名被拖长了预备期，其中有三十一名被拖长一年到三年。汤原县最近批了二十二个预备党员的转正材料，这些同志全部都延长了预备期，多的三年，少的也有半年多。
    产生这种现象的主要原因之一，是党的组织没有抓紧对预备党员的管理和教育工作，有些党员和党的组织错误地认为，一个人入了党，就算是万事大吉了，他们说：“师父领进门，修行在个人。”这样，党的组织就不能结合实际工作，确定专人去对预备党员进行教育和帮助，再加上组织生活不健全，致使预备党员在入党后没有受到更多的教育和锻炼，有些人到期后不能转正，因而苦闷，不安。汤原县万庆乡的新党员石成金说：入党前还有人常同我谈话，入党后谁也不找了，我感到入党前同入党后没有多大的区别，也没有什么进步。这就说明了，刚入党的同志是多么迫切地需要党组织指导和帮助，而作好对预备党员的管理和教育工作，对于巩固党的组织又是多么的重要。因此，我建议各级党的组织加强这方面的工作，把预备党员都教育培养成为合乎党章要求的正式党员，以增强党的战斗堡垒作用。　高振亚
　  为什么拖了五年多编辑同志：
    李振朋同志于1950年4月在山东荣城县第七区入党，预备期半年，但由于有关党组织的拖延，直到今年8月才办理转正手续，整整拖了五年又十个月。
    究竟是什么原因使李振朋的转正拖了这么久呢？
    李振朋入党五个月后，向乡支部提出了转正要求，当时答复是：“等整党后再说。”一拖就是三年。
    1953年7月，李振朋带着预备党员介绍信来到武汉市第一建筑工程公司一工地当临时工，在这个公司工作的一年半的期间，他写过十五次转正申请书，一直也无人过问。1954年9月，他参加了武汉市的防汛斗争，工作在一工段工地，由于他努力工作，体现了一个共产党员的优良品质，所以在防汛结束时，经支部大会讨论，一致同意按期转正。但报到建筑党委后，经审查提出了这样的疑问：“李为什么拖了这么久没有转正，可能有问题，需要考察考察，了解了解。”经过向批准李入党的中共荣城县第七区委了解，并无问题，不知为什么又拖下来。
    1954年12月，李又到武汉市土产公司做临时工，他一方面努力工作，一方面又继续恳切地向土产公司支部提出转正要求。这时，正当武汉市商业系统的整党将要开始，得到的回答又是等整党后再说。这样又拖了半年多。1956年1月整党开始，2月，因商业系统机构调整，李所工作的仓库交礄口区委领导。当时，经调查研究认为李可以转正。但是不幸得很，刚经党小组讨论通过，李的党的关系又转回原土产公司了。过了一些时，李向党支部干事询问他的材料是否由礄口区委转来。想不到材料竟被丢了，直到8月才转为正式党员。

　  奇怪的理由编辑同志：
    1952年12月，我在温州市文教局入党，预备期为六个月。1953年3月，调至浙江省工商联工作，同年7月初我写报告申请转正。小组在讨论我的转正的时候，全组有表决权的五人中，三人同意转正，有一人认为申请报告内容太简单，小组长就决定要我重新写报告，重新讨论。此后，我连续写了三次报告，小组都认为报告写得不好，就延长了我的预备期，小组长还给我增加了一条决定延期转正的理由是：“过期不申请，没有转党要求。”
    这个理由是很奇怪的，明明支部在1953年就讨论过我申请转正的报告，小组讨论的次数更多，难道支委会和小组把自己讨论过的事，竟忘得这样一干二净了吗？难道五个支部委员都是这样健忘吗？不是的，这是支委们抱着“与我无关”的态度，来对待党员的政治生命罢了。而且即使一个预备党员没有政治觉悟，过期不申请转正，难道支部就让他自生自灭吗？这显然是不符合建党方针的。
    到目前为止，我们支部又有三个预备党员超过预备期一年多了。支部应该关心这些同志的政治生命，切实地改变官僚主义作风。
