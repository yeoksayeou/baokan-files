Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, December 29th: The Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has greatly promoted the development of various construction undertakings by vigorously cultivating ethnic minority cadres, giving play to the functions of autonomous organs, and enhancing the unity of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture.

The Hui people, who are concentrated in this area, account for less than 40% of the total population, but in the recent election of 151 prefectural people's representatives, 74 are Hui. Among the 27 members of the Prefectural People's Committee, 13 are Hui. Hui representatives and representatives of other ethnic minorities are able to discuss and decide on the affairs of the autonomous prefecture at regularly scheduled sessions of the People's Congress. In the Prefectural and County Committees of the Chinese Communist Party, there are now Party secretaries from ethnic minorities. 35.3% of the members of the CPC Prefectural Committee are ethnic minorities, and the number of Party members of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture has increased from 386 two years ago to more than 1,000, of which ethnic minorities account for 46.9%.

The Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture is a multi-ethnic area with the Hui people as the main population, with more than ten ethnic groups, each with different characteristics and customs. For more than two years, the autonomous prefecture has attached great importance to enhancing unity among all ethnic groups, especially the unity among cadres of all ethnic groups. Leading cadres of all ethnic groups in the Party frequently hold separate forums among cadres of all ethnic groups to examine Han chauvinism and local nationalism. Cadres of all ethnic groups, because they are frequently educated on ethnic unity, pay close attention to respecting the customs and freedom of religious belief of all ethnic groups.

At present, more than 86% of the agricultural producers' cooperatives in the prefecture are composed of farmers of all ethnic groups who believe in religion and those who do not, and because of their joint labor, agricultural production has greatly developed. The actual sown area in 1956 increased by 13.92% compared with 1954, and the total grain income increased by more than 40 million catties compared with 1954. The 80,000 agricultural population in the prefecture has increased its grain income by more than 500 catties per person compared with 1954. The autonomous prefecture's animal husbandry production has also increased, with the number of large and small livestock increasing by 40.23% compared with 1954. The autonomous prefecture's cultural and educational work and other constructions have also achieved great development.

    聚居在这个地区的回族人民，占人口总数不到40％，但是在最近选出的一百五十一名州人民代表中，回族代表有七十四名。州人民委员会的二十七名委员中，有十三名是回族。回族代表和其他少数民族的代表，都能够在按期召开的人民代表大会会议上，讨论和决定自治州的事务。在中共州、县委员会中，现在都有了少数民族的党委书记。中共州委员会委员中，35.3％是少数民族，自治州的各族党员也由两年前的三百八十六名发展到一千多名，其中少数民族占46.9％。
    昌吉回族自治州是以回族为主的多民族杂居地区，有十个以上的民族，各民族都有不同的特点和风俗习惯。两年多来，自治州十分重视增进各民族之间的团结，特别是各族干部之间的团结。各族党员负责干部经常在各族干部中，分别主持召开座谈会，检查大民族主义思想和民族主义思想。各族干部由于经常受到民族团结的教育，都十分注意尊重各民族的风俗习惯和宗教信仰自由。
    现在，全州86％以上的农业生产合作社都是由信仰宗教的和不信仰宗教的各族农民组成的，因为他们的共同劳动，使农业生产有很大发展。1956年的实际播种面积比1954年增加13.92％，粮食总收入比1954年增加四千多万斤，全州八万农业人口，平均每个人比1954年增加粮食收入五百多斤。自治州的畜牧业生产也有提高，大小牲畜比1954年增加了40.23％。自治州的文化教育工作和其他各项建设，也都获得了很大发展。
