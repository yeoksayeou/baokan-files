    Abandoning the Near for the Far
    The Culture and Education Department of the Qidong County Committee in Shandong received a bulletin from the Education Section of the County People's Committee, sent through the post office. These two units are in the same courtyard, but the Education Section of the People's Committee put the bulletin in an envelope, wrote the address, affixed an eight-fen stamp, sent it to the post office two hundred meters away, and then had it delivered back by the postman to the County Committee's Culture and Education Department in the same courtyard. Some of our cadres are displaying their work enthusiasm in these kinds of things.

    舍近求远
    山东齐东县委会文教部收到县人民委员会教育科从邮局寄给他们的一份简报。这两个单位同在一个院内，可是人民委员会教育科却把简报装入信封，写上地址，还贴上八分邮票，送到相距二百公尺的邮局，再由邮递员送回来交给同院的县委文教部。我们有些干部就把工作积极性发挥在这些事上面。
