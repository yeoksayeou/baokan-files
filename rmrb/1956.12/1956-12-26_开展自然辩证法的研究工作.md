    Carry out research work on the dialectics of nature
    Gong Yuzhi

    During the formulation of the National Science Work Plan, many natural scientists and some philosophers in Beijing held a series of seminars to discuss the planning of research work on the dialectics of nature (or philosophical problems of natural science). I had the opportunity to participate in these discussions, and now I will give a brief introduction to the situation of the discussions here.

    Everyone believes that the study of the dialectics of nature is one of the most important aspects of philosophical research; and it is beginning to form an independent department of philosophy, just as historical materialism, which studies the general laws of social development, has become an independent department of philosophy. (There are still different opinions on whether the name of this philosophical department should be called the dialectics of nature.) However, the research in this area as a whole is still insufficient; as a scientific department, it is far from mature. In our country, research on the dialectics of nature is completely a blank subject, and there are almost no professional researchers; however, many natural scientists have shown great interest in this research in the past few years of philosophical study.

    The research content of the dialectics of nature is very rich, and can be roughly divided into the following five aspects:

    (1) Research on philosophical problems in the basic theories of modern mathematics and various natural sciences. In the process of development, the basic theoretical departments of various sciences constantly raise many new questions to philosophy. Such philosophical questions are those that natural scientists cannot avoid in their research work, and are the most confusing and interesting to them. The research results in this area have the most direct promoting effect on the development of natural science. At the same time, philosophy also first draws from the study of these problems, based on the latest factual materials and the latest theoretical concepts of natural science, to enrich and develop itself.

    There are many research topics belonging to this aspect. For example, in physics, the most important ones are the philosophical problems of quantum mechanics, the philosophical problems of relativity, etc. Quantum mechanics can only make statistical descriptions of the movement of micro-particles, and can only make probabilistic predictions (that is, predictions expressing the degree of possibility) of the results of movement. It establishes the principle that it is impossible to simultaneously and infinitely accurately determine the coordinates and momentum of micro-particles, etc. This raises philosophical questions on a new basis, such as the form of the law of causality, the essence of statistical regularity, necessity and contingency, the role of measuring instruments in the understanding of microscopic phenomena, and the task of refuting the agnostic distortion of quantum mechanics. The theory of relativity fundamentally changed the past physicists' concepts of matter, motion, space, and time, and proposed further research on the dialectical materialist theory of these categories on a new basis, and the task of refuting the relativist and subjectivist distortions of the theory of relativity. In addition, the philosophical problems of the theory of matter structure and field theory, the philosophical problems of statistical physics, etc., are also very important. The philosophical problems of biology have been discussed the most. Many of the problems debated between the Michurin school and the Mendel school, such as the material basis of heredity, the influence of the environment on the heredity of organisms, the relationship between quantitative change and qualitative change and the form of qualitative change in species change, and the nature of contradictions in intra-species and inter-species relations, all have important philosophical significance. There have also been many discussions with philosophical significance on the origin of life and the initial development of life. The philosophical problems in physics and biology are certainly not limited to those mentioned above, and other scientific departments, such as mathematics, astronomy, geology, chemistry, psychology, etc., of course also have their own important philosophical problems, which will not be listed here one by one.

    (2) Research on the scientific methodology of various sciences. In the long-term development, some natural sciences have formed a complete set of mature research methods. Some have also created many successful research methods, and are constantly creating new research methods. Analyzing and summarizing these research methods from the perspective of dialectical materialism, and establishing a systematic scientific methodology, will be very helpful to natural scientists. At the same time, philosophy can also draw a lot from the rich experience of summarizing natural science's cognitive activities to enrich the study of epistemology, dialectics, and logic. Research in this area can be divided into two parts. One part is the study of more general methods in natural science, such as the analysis and research of experimental and observation methods, the research of scientific hypotheses (the role of hypotheses in the formation of theories, what types of hypotheses there are, what ways to obtain hypotheses, typical analysis of important hypotheses in science, etc.), the role of mathematics in the research of various natural sciences, the role of analogy methods, images, etc. in research, etc. The other part is the study of special methods in various natural sciences. In addition, research in this area also includes general epistemological problems related to scientific methodology, such as the relationship between the general method of dialectical materialism and the specific methods of various sciences, the relationship between research methods and research objects, etc.

    (3) Research on the development of mathematical and natural scientific thought. This includes: the development of the central ideas of mathematics and various natural sciences in various periods, the research on the emergence, development, and struggle between dialectical materialism and idealism and metaphysics in mathematics and various natural sciences; the study of the emergence and evolution of important concepts (such as: number, matter, motion, mass, energy, biological species, evolution, etc.) and important theories (such as: the theory of matter structure, the theory of space-time, the theory of evolution, etc.) in mathematics and various natural sciences, and the study of the evolution of scientific methods; the study of the philosophical views and scientific methods of important natural scientists and mathematicians (studying all the materialist and dialectical factors in their philosophical views, criticizing the idealist and metaphysical views of some scientists, and specifically revealing the obstacles of these views to their scientific work). The purpose of this research is to summarize the experience of natural science's cognitive activities from the perspective of historical development.

    (4) Research on the various forms of motion in nature and the problem of scientific classification. Studying the division and connection of various forms of motion in nature, and studying the relationship between advanced forms of motion and low-level forms of motion, will help people deeply understand the division of various scientific departments, especially their connections and mutual penetration. This is of great significance for promoting the mutual influence of various scientific departments, guiding the development of marginal sciences (such as quantum chemistry, biochemistry, biophysics, etc.), and promoting the emergence of new scientific departments. In the issue of the relationship between various forms of motion, the problem of reductionism (that is, simply reducing advanced motion to low-level motion) and the problem of mysticism (that is, denying the connection between advanced motion and low-level motion, and attributing advanced motion to certain mysterious forces, such as vitality) should be studied more, because both tendencies greatly hinder the development of science. This research is also a basic work for forming a dialectical materialist picture of nature based on the latest achievements in natural science.

    (5) Using the new achievements of mathematics and various natural sciences to study the laws and categories of dialectical materialism, and to study the general laws of motion in nature. The laws and categories of dialectical materialism are generalized from natural science and social science. Therefore, it is necessary to study the basic concepts of various sciences, especially based on the latest understanding of these concepts by natural science, to study the categories of dialectical materialism (such as matter, motion, change, development, space, time, necessity, contingency, finite, infinite, continuous, discontinuous, etc.). At the same time, on the basis of summarizing the achievements of various natural sciences, the study of the general laws of nature (just as historical materialism studies the general laws of the social world) is also a task that should be started today.

    On the basis of the above five aspects of research, summarizing and studying the logical system of the philosophical department of natural dialectics, and studying the picture of nature and the history of natural development based on the latest scientific achievements are also important research tasks.

    All the above aspects of research work should be carried out with the study and criticism of idealist viewpoints, historical investigation, and inheritance of all beneficial achievements of predecessors in the study of these issues.

    From the above research content, it can be seen that the research on the dialectics of nature is very important. For philosophy, this research not only provides countless vivid arguments for the principles of dialectical materialism, and not only promotes the further enrichment and refinement of the principles of dialectical materialism, but also mainly raises many new philosophical questions that cannot be found ready-made answers in past classics. The solution of these new problems will enable philosophy to develop further. For natural scientists, research in this area will help them activate their thinking, broaden their horizons, help them absorb the experience and lessons of the history of human cognition, help them get rid of the ideological constraints of popular vulgar philosophy, and obtain correct guidance on thinking methods.

    How to carry out research in this area? Everyone put forward the following opinions:

    To carry out research in this area, we must rely on the cooperation of natural scientists and philosophers. We already have a group of natural scientists who are very interested in the study of the dialectics of nature, which is a good condition for carrying out the study of the dialectics of nature. Everyone hopes that as natural scientists' interest in philosophy further increases, this team will continue to expand, and a group of talents who are both natural scientists and philosophers will emerge from it. Everyone feels that many philosophers in our country do not pay enough attention to research in this area, and hopes that this situation can be changed. Especially in the work of training new philosophical cadres, it is hoped that attention will be paid to giving young people the natural science training necessary for modern philosophers, and cultivating a group of philosophical experts in the dialectics of nature. Only through the efforts of both natural scientists and philosophers can we truly establish the alliance of materialists and natural scientists advocated by Lenin.

    Research on the dialectics of nature in our country has just begun. At present, the main thing is to quickly start the work, but we should also pay attention to absorbing the experience and lessons of the Soviet Union and other countries in this area, cultivating a correct style of study, and preventing those adverse tendencies that will hinder the research work from achieving results. Everyone mentioned such a bias: while correctly criticizing the idealist philosophy that penetrates natural science, mistakenly taking a negative attitude towards real natural scientific facts and theories without analysis should be prevented. Some philosophers in the Soviet Union once held a negative attitude towards relativity, cybernetics, mathematical logic, and quantum chemistry because of criticizing idealism, which has recently been corrected. There is also a tendency to simplify and vulgarize the relationship between philosophy and natural science, to replace natural science with philosophy, to replace natural science principles with general philosophical propositions, to replace natural scientific research on the mechanism of specific natural processes with general philosophical explanations, and even to not treat natural science facts and achievements with an open mind, but instead to rigidify some philosophical principles and clauses and use them to issue orders to natural science. Some of the past errors and shortcomings in the study of philosophical problems in biological science seem to be of this nature. Just as good philosophy will promote the development of natural science, bad philosophy that does not respect facts and science, and is rigid and arbitrary, will of course hinder the development of natural science.

    Promoting a practical and simple style of study is considered very necessary by everyone. Confined to repeatedly quoting the words of classic works, confined to citing a few natural science materials as examples of philosophical principles, and failing to face up to all the exciting new problems raised in the development of natural science and setting them aside or glossing over them, such research is of no use. Advocating not putting on airs, not pretending, writing about a problem as soon as it is discovered, writing about an opinion as soon as a problem is solved and a point of view is obtained, and writing about a confusion as soon as it occurs, in this way, people can be guided to conduct research in a practical and simple manner. The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend should be implemented in this research work.

    In order to promote research on the dialectics of nature, relevant departments also need to pay attention to and support it, especially since this kind of research work has a certain mass character (in terms of the need to widely attract natural scientists to participate in research), which makes it even more necessary. Everyone hopes that the Institute of Philosophy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will pay attention to contacting the vast number of natural scientists and philosophers, promote and organize research in this area, and publish a communication-type publication as a tool for connecting, promoting, and organizing work; it is hoped that publishing organizations will translate and publish relevant foreign monographs and papers on the dialectics of nature to provide necessary materials for research work.

    开展自然辩证法的研究工作
    龚育之
    在制定全国科学工作规划的期间，在北京的许多自然科学家和一些哲学家一起开了一系列的座谈会，讨论了自然辩证法（或自然科学哲学问题）研究工作的规划。笔者有机会参加了这些讨论，现在将讨论的情况在这里作一个简略的介绍。
    大家认为，自然辩证法的研究，是哲学研究的最重要的方面之一；而且它正在开始形成为哲学的一个独立部门，好像研究社会发展的一般规律的历史唯物主义已经成为哲学的一个独立部门一样。（关于这个哲学部门的名称是否应该叫做自然辩证法，大家还有不同的意见。）但是，这方面的研究，整个来说，还是不够的；作为一个科学部门，还远不够成熟。在我国，自然辩证法的研究更完全是一个空白学科，专业研究人员几乎完全没有过；不过，许多自然科学家在几年来的哲学学习中，对于这方面的研究表现了很大的兴趣。
    自然辩证法的研究内容是很丰富的，大体上可以分作下面的五个方面：
    （一）现代数学和各门自然科学的基本理论中的哲学问题的研究。各门科学的基本理论部门在发展中不断向哲学提出许多新的问题。这样的哲学问题是自然科学家在他们的研究工作中不能不涉及的，是他们最感困惑也是最感兴趣的。这方面的研究成果对自然科学的发展，起着最直接的推动作用。同时，哲学也首先是从对这些问题的研究中，根据自然科学的最新事实材料和最新理论概念来丰富和发展自己。
    属于这一方面的研究题目很多。例如，在物理学中，最重要的有量子力学的哲学问题，相对论的哲学问题等。量子力学对于微粒子的运动只能作出统计性的描述，只能对运动的结果作出几率的（即表示可能性程度的）预言，它确立了不可能同时无限精确地测定微粒子的坐标和冲量的原理等等，这就提出了在新的基础上研究像因果律的形式，统计的规律性的本质，必然性和偶然性，测量仪器在认识微观现象中的作用等哲学问题，和驳斥对量子力学作不可知论的歪曲的任务。相对论根本改变了过去物理学家对于物质、运动、空间、时间的概念，提出了在新的基础上进一步研究辩证唯物主义关于这些范畴的学说，驳斥对相对论作相对主义和主观主义歪曲的任务。此外，如物质结构理论和场论的哲学问题，统计物理学的哲学问题等，也都很重要。生物学的哲学问题讨论得最多，米丘林学派和孟德尔学派之间争论的许多问题，像遗传的物质基础，环境对生物体遗传性的影响，生物种变化中量变质变的关系和质变的形式，种内种间关系上矛盾的性质等，都有重要的哲学意义。在生命的起源和生命的最初发展问题上，也有过不少有哲学意义的讨论。物理学、生物学中的哲学问题当然不止于上面提到的这些，其他科学部门，如数学、天文学、地学、化学、心理学等等，当然也都有自己的重要哲学问题，这里不一一列举了。
    （二）各门科学的科学方法论的研究。各门自然科学在长期发展中有的已经形成了一整套成熟的研究方法。有的也已经创造了许多成功的研究方法，并且都在不断地创造新的研究方法。从辩证唯物主义的观点来分析和总结这些研究方法，建立系统的科学方法论，这对自然科学家的帮助会是很重要的。同时，哲学从总结自然科学认识活动的丰富经验中，也能汲取很多东西，来充实认识论、辩证法和逻辑的研究。这方面的研究可以分作两部分。一部分是自然科学中较一般的方法的研究，例如，实验、观察方法的分析和研究，科学假设的研究（假设在形成理论中的作用，假设有些什么类型，获得假设有些什么途径，科学中重要假设的典型分析等），数学在各门自然科学研究中的作用，类比方法、形象等在研究中的作用等等。另一部分是各门自然科学中的特殊方法的研究。此外，这方面的研究还包括和科学方法论有关的一般认识论问题，如辩证唯物主义一般方法和各门科学的具体方法的关系，研究方法和研究对象的关系问题等。
    （三）数学和各门自然科学思想发展的研究。这方面包括：数学和各门自然科学各个时期的中心思想的发展，辩证唯物主义在数学和各门自然科学中发生、发展以及和唯心主义和形而上学斗争历史的研究；数学和各门自然科学中重要概念（如：数、物质、运动、质量、能量、生物种、进化等概念）和重要理论（如：物质结构理论，时空理论，进化论等）的产生、演变的研究，科学方法演变的研究；重要自然科学家和数学家的哲学观点和科学方法的研究（研究他们的哲学观点中一切唯物主义和辩证法的因素，批判有些科学家的唯心主义和形而上学观点，具体地揭明这些观点对他们的科学工作的妨碍）。这方面的研究的目的是从历史发展的角度来总结自然科学认识活动的经验。
    （四）自然界各种运动形态和科学分类问题的研究。研究自然界各种运动形态的划分和联系，研究高级运动形态和低级运动形态的关系，会帮助人们深入地了解各个科学部门的划分，特别是它们之间的联系和相互渗透，这对于推动各个科学部门相互影响，指导边缘科学（如量子化学、生物化学、生物物理学等）的发展，促进新科学部门的产生，都是有很大意义的。在各种运动形态关系的问题上，还元论（即把高级运动简单地归结为低级运动）和神秘论（即否认高级运动和低级运动的联系，把高级运动归之于某些神秘的力，如生命力）的问题要多加研究，因为无论那种倾向都大大阻碍着科学的发展。这方面的研究，对于形成依据最新自然科学成就的辩证唯物主义自然图景，也是一种基础的工作。
    （五）根据数学和各门自然科学的新成就来研究辩证唯物主义的规律和范畴，研究自然界运动的一般规律。辩证唯物主义的规律和范畴是从自然科学和社会科学中概括出来的，因此，必须研究各门科学的基本概念，特别是依据自然科学对这些概念的最新理解，来研究辩证唯物主义的范畴（如物质、运动、变化、发展、空间、时间、必然性、偶然性、有限、无限、连续、不连续等等）。同时，在概括各门自然科学成就的基础上，研究自然界一般规律的问题（如同历史唯物主义研究社会界的一般规律一样），也是今天应当着手的工作。
    在以上五个方面研究的基础上，概括起来，研究自然辩证法这个哲学部门的逻辑体系问题，研究以最新科学成就为依据的自然图景和自然发展史问题，也是重要的研究任务。
    以上各方面的研究工作，都要贯彻对于唯心主义观点的研究和批判，都要进行历史的考察，继承前人在这些问题研究上的一切有益的成果。
    从上述的研究内容，可以看出，自然辩证法的研究是十分重要的。对于哲学，这方面的研究不仅是为辩证唯物主义原理提供无数生动的论证，不仅是促使辩证唯物主义原理进一步丰富和精确化，而且主要是提出许多新的、从过去的经典著作中找不到现成答案的哲学问题，这些新问题的解决，将使哲学进一步向前发展。对于自然科学家，这方面的研究将帮助他们活跃思想，开阔眼界，帮助他们吸取人类认识史的经验和教训，帮助他们摆脱流行的庸俗哲学的思想束缚，获得思想方法上的正确指导。
    如何开展这方面的研究呢？大家提出了下面这些意见：
    开展这方面的研究，必须依靠自然科学家和哲学家的合作。我们已经拥有一批对自然辩证法研究有很大兴趣的自然科学家，这是开展自然辩证法研究的很好的条件。大家希望，随着自然科学家对于哲学兴趣的进一步提高，这个队伍将不断地扩大起来，并且从中产生出一批兼而为自然科学家和哲学家的人才。大家感到，我国有不少哲学家对这方面的研究还不够重视，希望这种情况能够改变，特别是在培养新的哲学干部的工作中，希望注意给青年以作为现代哲学家所必备的自然科学训练，并且培养出一批自然辩证法的哲学专家。只有通过自然科学家和哲学家两方面的努力，才能真正建立列宁所倡导的唯物主义者和自然科学家的联盟。
    我国自然辩证法的研究刚刚开始，目前主要的是迅速把工作开展起来，但也应当注意吸取苏联和其他国家这方面的经验和教训，培养正确的学风，防止那些会阻碍研究工作获得成绩的不良倾向。大家提到，这样一种偏向：在正确的批判渗入自然科学的唯心主义哲学的同时，错误地不加分析地对真正的自然科学事实和理论采取否定态度，是要注意防止的。苏联有一些哲学家曾经一度由于批判唯心主义而对相对论、控制论、数理逻辑、量子化学抱有否定态度，近来得到了纠正。还有一种偏向，就是把哲学对自然科学的关系简单化、庸俗化，用哲学代替自然科学，用一般哲学命题代替自然科学原理，用一般哲学解释代替对具体自然过程的机理的自然科学研究，甚至不虚心对待自然科学的事实和成就，反而把一些哲学原理和条文僵死化并用来向自然科学发号施令。生物科学哲学问题的研究中过去的有一些错误和缺点，看来是属于这种性质。正如好的哲学会促进自然科学发展一样，不尊重事实和科学的、僵化而专断的坏的哲学，当然会要阻碍自然科学的发展。
    提倡一种切实的朴素的学风，大家认为是很需要的。限于反复引证经典著作的字句，限于引用若干自然科学材料作为哲学原理的例证，不去正视自然科学发展中提出的一切激动人心的新鲜问题而把它一旁放过或一笔带过，这样的研究，是没有什么用处的。提倡不摆架子，不装腔作势，发现一个问题就写出这一个问题，解决一个问题得到一点意见就写出这一点意见，发生一点困惑就写出这一点困惑，这样，才能引导人们切实朴素地进行研究。百家争鸣的方针，要在这方面研究工作中贯彻。
    为了推动自然辩证法的研究，还需要有关部门予以重视和支持，特别由于这种研究工作带有一定群众性（从必须广泛吸引自然科学家参加研究来说），更加需要这样。大家希望：中国科学院哲学研究所注意联系广大自然科学家和哲学家，推动和组织这方面的研究工作，并且出版一个通讯性质的刊物，作为联系、推动和组织工作的工具；希望出版机关把有关自然辩证法的外国专著和论文编译出版，为研究工作提供必要的资料。
