    Bitter Bird in the Mountains
　　Yequ
    During autumn and winter moonlit nights, when the moonlight shines as bright as day, there is such a bird in the mountains. Deep in the woods, it cries out, lonely and desolate, "Bitter! Bitter!" awakening the people in the mountain villages from their sweet dreams.
    I turned on the light and looked at the clock. It was 1:10 AM. This was an unpleasant time, dusk had already passed, and morning had not yet arrived. What to do? I could only appreciate the moonlight and the bird's song.
    There are two popular legends about the bitter bird in the mountain villages. One goes like this:
    The eldest daughter of a family married a man from a neighboring village. This man often praised his wife's beauty to her. The wife said, "I can hardly be considered beautiful; my younger sister is the real beauty!"
  "Could there be a beauty more beautiful than you in the world? I don't believe it!" the man said. "You'll believe it when you see her!" the wife said. "Unfortunately, it's not easy to see my sister; she never goes out and doesn't see any men!"
    Hearing this, the man became even more eager to see his sister-in-law and repeatedly begged his wife to let him meet her. The wife finally came up with a plan, sending a letter to her sister with the false news that she was seriously ill, hoping her sister would come to see her. Upon receiving the letter, the younger sister came to visit her sister, only to find out upon arriving at her sister's house that her sister was not ill, but only because her brother-in-law wanted to meet her. The younger sister stayed at her sister's house for three days and became intimate with her brother-in-law. The older sister fell ill from then on, depressed and unhappy, and died. After death, her soul transformed into a bird, calling out "Bitter! Bitter! Borrow me a comb to comb a dog's head, borrow me a mirror to look at a dog's head!" every night facing the dressing table in her sister's room window.
    Another goes like this:
    Early one morning, a sister-in-law received news that her birth mother in her parents' home was ill and hurried back to her parents' home. Before leaving, she entrusted her newborn child to her sister, saying, "If the child urinates or defecates, please wash him!" In the evening, the sister-in-law returned but did not see the child. She asked her sister:
  "Where is the child?"
    "The child? Didn't you tell me to wash him? I have already washed him clean and put him there," the sister replied, pointing to a basket hanging in front of the corridor.
    The sister-in-law took down the basket and saw that the child's belly had been cut open, washed clean. Both grieved and angered, she fell ill and died. After death, she turned into a bird, calling out
  "Bitter! Bitter!"
    Our ancestors had long seen their own shortcomings, so they warned themselves: "Arrogance should not be prolonged, desires should not be indulged, ambitions should not be fully realized, and pleasure should not be excessive," [Note], and between people, they also established many passive preventive measures:
  "Men and women should not sit together indiscriminately, nor share clothes racks, nor share towels and combs..." [Note] Despite this, in a social system where people exploit people, people still regard exploitation, harm, deception, and lies as the unshakable foundation of happiness, as a matter of course.
    In the new society, the foundation of exploitation must be completely destroyed, the relationships between people have changed, and people should base happiness on labor, friendship, honesty, and sincerity. How to further sublimate the human spirit and morality is not the responsibility of our generation?

    山中有苦鸟
　　野渠
    当秋、冬的月夜，月光照耀得如同白昼，山中有这样的鸟，在树林深处，孤单而凄凉地“苦呀！苦呀！”一声声地叫着，把沉在甜蜜睡梦中的山村的人们叫醒了。
    我开了电灯，一看表，一时十分。这是一个不愉快的时刻，黄昏呢，已经过去了；早晨呢，还没有到来。怎么办呢，只好欣赏这月色和鸟声罢。
    关于苦鸟在山村里流行着两种传说。一种是这样的：
    某家的大女儿嫁给邻村的一个男子，这个男子时常对着他的妻夸赞她的美。妻子说：“我那里算得上美，我的妹妹才真是一个美女哩！”
  “世上能有比你更美的美女么？我不相信！”男人说。“你见到才会相信！”妻子说；“可惜，要见我妹妹是不容易的，她从来不出门，不见任何一个男人！”
    这么一说，男人可更加渴望见到小姨了，再三恳求着妻子让他见一面。妻子终于想出了一个办法，带信给她的妹妹诳言自己病重，希望妹妹来看她。得到这个信，妹妹来探望姊姊了，一到姊姊家才知道姊姊并不生病，只是因为姊夫想见她一面。妹妹在姊姊家一住三天，就和姊夫好上了。姊姊从此得了一病，忧郁不乐而死，死后灵魂变成一只鸟，每当夜晚，对着妹妹房间窗口的梳妆台，叫着“苦呀！苦呀！借我梳子梳狗头，借我镜子照狗头！”
    另一种是这样：
    一大早，嫂嫂得到娘家亲生母患病的消息，急急忙忙赶回娘家去。临走时，把刚满月的小孩托给她的姑娘，说：“孩子倘使大、小便了，请你给他洗一洗！”到傍晚，嫂嫂回来了，不见孩子，问姑娘说：
  “孩子呢？”
    “孩子么？你不是叫我给他洗一洗么？我已把他洗干净了，放在那里。”姑娘指着挂在廊前的一只篮子，回答说。
    嫂嫂取下篮子一看，孩子被破了肚子，洗得干干净净，又悲又气，一病死了，死后变成一只鸟，叫着
  “苦呀！苦呀！”
    我们的祖先早就看出了自身的缺点，所以便这样告诫着自己：“敖不可长，欲不可从，志不可满，乐不可极。”〔注〕，而且在人与人之间，还定出了许多消极的防范的办法；
  “男女不杂坐，不同椸枷，不同巾栉……”〔注〕诸如此类，尽管如此，在人剥削人的社会制度里，人总依旧是以剥削人，伤害人，欺骗，说诳作为天经地义的不可动摇的幸福的基础。
    在新社会里，剥削的基础要被彻底摧毁掉，人与人之间的关系改变了，人应当以劳动、友爱、正直、真诚作为幸福的基础。怎样把人的精神和道德更加升华，难道不是我们这一代人的责任么？
