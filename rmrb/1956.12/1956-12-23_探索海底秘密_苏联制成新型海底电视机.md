Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 22nd: The Soviet Union has recently created a new type of "80-4" undersea television. Its characteristic is that it can be placed at a depth of about 500 meters to explore the secrets of the seabed, which is about twice as deep as ordinary undersea televisions. Moreover, its camera and receiver can rotate very flexibly to capture scenes from all directions.

Using this type of television, people can sit indoors and clearly see the real situation of the seabed structure and the activities of aquatic animals hundreds of feet deep, in order to conduct scientific research and teaching work. At the same time, it can also be used to explore sunken ships and periodically check the condition of dams in water conservancy projects.

Undersea television developed from ordinary televisions. The Soviet Union designed its first undersea television in 1948. Now the Soviet Union already has several types of undersea televisions and has used them in fishing, inspecting cracks in water dikes, and repairing ships. However, they can only work underwater at a depth of 200 to 300 meters.

    探索海底秘密
    苏联制成新型海底电视机
    据新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联最近创制了一种八十分之四型海底电视机。它的特点是能够放到水深约五百公尺的地方去探索海底的秘密，比一般海底电视机要深一倍左右。而且它的摄收部分能够非常灵活地转动，摄取各个方面的景物。
    利用这种电视机，人们只要坐在室内，就可以清清楚楚地看到百丈深的海底结构和水中动物活动的真实情况，以进行科学研究和教学工作；同时，还可以利用它来探索海底的沉船和定期检查水利工程中堤坝的情况。
    海底电视机是在普通的电视机上发展起来的。苏联在1948年设计了第一部海底电视机，现在苏联已经有好几种类型的海底电视机了，并且已经用在捕鱼、检查水堤裂缝和修理船只方面。但是，它们都只能够在水深二百到三百公尺的水下工作。
