They searched for each other in the crowd and shook hands warmly and talked freely after meeting. In their conversations, many people talked about the traditional friendship between the border people of China and Burma throughout history, and expressed their desire to further strengthen friendly ties between the two sides in the future.

During the talks, Burmese guests Minister Su Pa and Minister Su La warmly held hands with Gong Shou, Deputy Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and Si Lachan, and took pictures.

    他们是在迎宾馆前的广场上会见的。中缅边境地区的政府官员和少数民族公众领袖三五成群地用傣话或景颇话欢乐地交谈，他们有的原来就是相识的朋友，今天旧友重逢，感到很高兴；有的虽然没见过面，但因所住地区毗连，早已知道彼此的名字，在人丛中，他们互相寻找，见面以后，热情地握手畅谈。在交谈中，很多人都讲到历史上中缅两国边境人民的传统友谊，表示今后要更加强双方的友好联系。
    谈话进行中，缅甸客人苏帕部长和素拉部长同德宏傣族景颇族自治州副州长龚绶、司拉山亲热地挽手照相。其他人也都互相照相留念。缅甸朋友们说：历史上从来没有这样的会晤，要多多拍上几张作为纪念。
