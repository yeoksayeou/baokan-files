Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 2nd: The three generating units of the Lhasa Hydropower Station, constructed with the assistance of the State Council, were all put into operation at 4:00 PM yesterday.

After Gesang Dorje, an old worker who had worked at the old Lhasa power plant for more than twenty years, opened the gate, the machines began to turn. The young apprentice Dawa flipped the switch, and the lights both inside and outside the plant shone brightly.

Liu Xia Tudeng Daba, Acting Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, said at a gathering celebrating the full commissioning of the new power station that all the machines in the new power station were manufactured in our own country, and were completed in a short period with the help of Han technicians and workers. We sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and the central government for their concern.

Fan Ming, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, said:
“The Lhasa Hydropower Station is a bright flower, and as the country's socialist construction事業 develops, this bright flower will gradually bloom all over Tibet." He said that the Lhasa Hydropower Station is not large, but it provides experience for the future large-scale use of the rich water resources on the plateau to establish power stations.

More than a thousand Tibetan officials and people from all walks of life who came to the power station to congratulate visited the power station's equipment after the meeting.

　  拉萨水电站全部送电
    新华社拉萨2日电　国务院帮助建设的拉萨水电站的三台机组，昨天下午四时全部送电。
    在拉萨旧电厂工作了二十多年的老工人格桑多杰把闸门打开后，机器转动了，青年学工打瓦扳动开关，厂内外的电灯齐放光明。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会代理秘书长柳霞·土登塔巴在为庆祝新电站全部送电的集会上说，新电站的全部机器都是我国自己制造的，在汉族技术人员和工人帮助下短期内就建成了，我们衷心感谢中国共产党和中央的关怀。
    中共西藏工委副书记范明说：
  “拉萨水电站是一株光明的花，随着国家社会主义建设事业的发展，这株光明的花一定会逐步开遍全西藏”。他说，拉萨水电站还不大，但它对今后大量利用高原上丰富的水力资源建立发电站，提供了经验。
    一千多个到电站祝贺的藏族官员和各界人士，在会后参观了电站的设备。
