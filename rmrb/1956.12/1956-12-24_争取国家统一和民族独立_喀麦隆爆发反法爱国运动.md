    Striving for National Reunification and National Independence
    Patriotic Anti-French Movement Erupts in Cameroon
    Xinhua News Agency, Yaoundé, 22nd: The French colonial authorities in Cameroon, the French-administered territory in Equatorial Africa, have decided to hold so-called "parliamentary elections" on the 23rd to elect a "parliament" to decide whether Cameroon should maintain its current trusteeship status or become a member of the French Federation.

    The Cameroon People's Union, a patriotic organization that has been outlawed, is calling on the people to boycott the election. It is demanding national reunification and national independence.

    According to Agence France-Presse, an anti-French patriotic movement has already erupted in Cameroon. Local patriots have held demonstrations and sabotaged many transportation lines, including the Douala-Yaoundé railway. According to UPI, officials of the French colonial authorities are worried that the movement will spread throughout the country.

    The French government hurriedly sent paratroopers to help suppress the Cameroonian national movement. According to Agence France-Presse, two French paratroop units landed on the 21st at the Pesseka Airport, forty miles southwest of Yaoundé, the administrative capital of Cameroon.

    (Editor's Note) Cameroon is a British and French trusteeship located on the west coast of Africa, north of the equator, with a population of over four million. Of these, over three million are in the French-administered area and over one million are in the British-administered area. The capital of the French-administered area is Yaoundé, and the capital of the British-administered area is Buea.

    In 1884, Cameroon was occupied by Germany. After the First World War, it was divided between Britain and France. After the Second World War, the United Nations Trusteeship Council decided that Cameroon should remain under British and French administration.

    Under the long-term rule of British and French imperialism in Cameroon, the people's living conditions are extremely harsh. Workers work as long as eleven hours a day, while wages are the lowest in the world. The working people are often threatened by disease and hunger.

    The Cameroonian people's national liberation movement against British and French imperialism is developing day by day. Patriotic organizations such as the Cameroon People's Union, the Unified Trade Union Alliance, the Cameroon Trade Union Federation, and the Unified National Assembly are actively participating in the struggle against colonial rule.

    The Cameroon People's Union is a political party that strives for national reunification and fights for the abolition of the colonial system. The general secretary of the alliance, Ouandié, presented the Cameroonian people's demands for achieving reunification and independence, for the establishment of legislative and administrative bodies through universal suffrage, and for national self-determination to the meeting of the UN Trusteeship Committee in December 1952.

    争取国家统一和民族独立
    喀麦隆爆发反法爱国运动
    新华社22日讯　喀麦隆雅温得消息：赤道非洲法国托管地喀麦隆的法国殖民当局决定在23日举行所谓“议会选举”，以便选出“议会”来决定喀麦隆今后是维持现有的托管地地位或是成为法兰西联邦的成员。
    已经被取缔的爱国组织喀麦隆人民联盟号召人民抵制这次选举。它提出了祖国统一和民族独立的要求。
    据法新社报道，目前喀麦隆已经爆发了反法爱国运动。当地爱国者举行了示威，并且破坏了许多交通线，包括杜阿拉—雅温得铁路在内。据合众社说法国殖民当局的官员担心这个运动会发展到全国各地。
    法国政府急忙派伞兵去帮助镇压喀麦隆的民族运动。据法新社报道，两个法国伞兵部队21日已经在喀麦隆行政首府雅温得西南四十哩的坡塞卡机场着陆。
    （编者注）喀麦隆系英法托管地，位于赤道以北的非洲西海岸，人口四百多万。其中法管区三百多万，英管区一百多万。法管区首府为雅温得，英管区首府为布埃亚。
    1884年喀麦隆被德国占领。第一次世界大战后，由英法两国分管。第二次世界大战后，联合国托管理事会决定喀麦隆仍由英法两国分管。
    喀麦隆在英法帝国主义的长期统治下，人民生活情况非常恶劣，工人的工作时间长达十一小时，而工资是世界上最低的。劳动人民经常受到疾病和饥饿的威胁。
    喀麦隆人民反对英法帝国主义的民族解放运动正在日益发展，喀麦隆人民联盟和统一工会联盟、喀麦隆工会联合会和统一国民大会等爱国组织都积极地参加了反对殖民统治的斗争。
    喀麦隆人民联盟是一个争取国家统一、并为废除殖民地制度而斗争的政党。该联盟的总书记乌涅奥贝曾于1952年12月向联大托管委员会会议提出喀麦隆人民对实现统一和独立、由普选产生立法和行政机构以及民族自决权等要求。
