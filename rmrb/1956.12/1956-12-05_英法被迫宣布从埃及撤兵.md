Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: On December 3rd, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and French Foreign Minister Pineau separately announced in the British House of Commons and the French National Assembly that the British and French governments, in view of the effective international force of the United Nations having arrived in the Suez Canal Zone, had agreed to withdraw their troops from the Port Said area.

Lloyd said: "The two governments have ordered the commander of the Allied forces, Keightley, and the commander of the United Nations forces, Burns, to reach an agreement on the timetable for withdrawal after considering the relevant military and practical issues."

Pineau revealed that Britain and France still wanted to implement the so-called "international control" of the Suez Canal plan. He said: The British and French governments believe that, regarding the Suez Canal issue, in addition to the six principles passed by the Security Council, the proposals put forward by Britain and France to the Security Council should also be considered. This proposal calls for the "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" for "international control" of the canal or a proposal equivalent to this proposal to be adopted. They also requested direct negotiations between the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Egypt.

　　英法被迫宣布从埃及撤兵
    据新华社讯　12月3日，英国外交大臣劳埃德和法国外交部长比诺，分别在英国下院和法国国民议会宣布：英法两国政府鉴于联合国有效的国际部队已开到苏伊士运河区，同意撤退在塞得港地区的军队。
    劳埃德说：“两国政府已经命令联军司令凯特莱和联合国部队司令伯恩斯在考虑有关的军事和实际问题以后，再就撤退时间表问题取得协议。”
    比诺吐露了英法仍想实行所谓“国际管制”苏伊士运河的计划。他说：英法政府认为，关于苏伊士运河问题，除了安全理事会通过的六项原则之外，还应该考虑英法向安全理事会提出的提案，这个提案要求通过“国际管制”运河的“十八国建议”或是同这个建议相当的建议。它们还要求英法埃三国外交部长直接进行谈判。
