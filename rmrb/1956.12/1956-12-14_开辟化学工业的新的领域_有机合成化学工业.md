Opening up a New Field in the Chemical Industry - The Organic Synthesis Chemical Industry
Zhang Zhen, Vice Minister of Chemical Industry

The Importance of the Organic Synthesis Chemical Industry

The proposal made by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China regarding the Second Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy pointed out that special efforts should be made to establish the organic synthesis chemical industry.

What is organic synthesis chemistry?

As we know, there are hundreds of thousands of hydrocarbons and chemically complex substances in nature, all of which were naturally produced in the past, or obtained from animals and plants. Now that we know their composition and structure through chemical methods, it is possible to obtain them from the simplest raw materials through synthesis. With the development of industrial technology, the task of the chemical industry is not only to mass-produce natural substances by synthetic methods, but more importantly, to create new substances that do not exist in nature and whose properties better meet the requirements of modern technology. All industries that manufacture hydrocarbons or chemically complex substances from the simplest raw materials by synthetic methods are the organic synthesis chemical industry.

The organic synthesis chemical industry has the following main sectors:

Plastic Industry

Plastic is a very important synthetic material. Because of its excellent characteristics such as lightness, high strength, transparency, beauty, insulation, and resistance to chemical corrosion, it is widely used in almost all industries and daily necessities. It can replace metal in large quantities, especially non-ferrous metals, and can be used to manufacture parts and components for aircraft, automobiles, and other machinery and equipment. Some people see that the strength of hand-pressed plastic products in some countries is not high, and think that plastics can only be used for parts with low loads; in fact, plastic products pressed by large hydraulic presses, especially some high-quality plastics, can have extremely high tensile strength, so they can be used as gears, brakes and bearings on heavy machinery such as rolling mills. One ton of plastic can replace an average of three tons of non-ferrous metals, which can save a lot of non-ferrous metals for the most necessary places. And the investment and time required to build a plastic factory is much less than that required to develop the non-ferrous metal industry (including mining). The use of plastic products can also greatly reduce the weight of machines. A car can reduce its weight by about half a ton by using plastics. Plastics can not only replace metals, but also have better properties than metals in some aspects. Plastic parts do not make any noise when rotating. The use of plastic gears and spindles in textile workshops can reduce the noise in the workshop. Plastic shafts are more wear-resistant than alloy shafts, have a service life six times longer than non-ferrous metals, and do not need lubrication. Plastics have high insulation properties and are good materials for the electrical industry, especially polyethylene plastics and silicone organic plastics, which can maintain insulation properties at high and low temperatures, and are indispensable for the technological development of the power industry and the radio industry. As for daily necessities, such as food utensils, film, records, etc., almost all can be made of plastic. Therefore, the plastic industry occupies a very important position in the national economy. The world's plastic production is growing rapidly. In 1950, the world's plastic production was about one million tons, which increased to more than two million tons in 1954.

Synthetic Fiber Industry

Synthetic fibers and man-made fibers are important raw materials for the textile industry. Synthetic fibers are made from plastics, while man-made fibers are made from natural fibers (such as wood straw). People are already familiar with the durable characteristics of synthetic and man-made fibers in daily necessities such as shirts and socks made of "Nylon", "Capron" and rayon. Because synthetic fibers are not afraid of water, corrosion resistant, unaffected by light and climate, and have elasticity and strength exceeding all natural fibers and high-strength rayon, they are indispensable industrial fibers. For example, the use of synthetic fibers as the cord layer of rubber tires can resist the impact force of jet aircraft and heavy bombers landing, and can reduce the thickness of ordinary car tires and extend their life by more than double, thereby saving a lot of rubber. Synthetic fibers are made from coal, benzene and petroleum waste gas, and agricultural waste products (such as furfural), while man-made fibers are made from wood straw. One ton of phenol or three tons of wood can make 15,000 pairs of women's socks at a very low price. If the price of raw silk is 100 yuan, the price of synthetic fiber is only 20 to 40 yuan, and the price of rayon is only 10 yuan. With the improvement of technology and the use of cheap raw materials, the cost of synthetic fibers is constantly decreasing. Because of the above advantages of synthetic and man-made fibers, plus its production is not restricted by arable land and climate, it has developed rapidly. In the past two decades, the world's cotton production has only increased by 30%, but the output of synthetic and man-made fibers in 1954 was ten times higher than in 1940.

Synthetic Rubber Industry

The development of the synthetic rubber industry also has important economic and strategic significance. There are many types of synthetic rubber. Although no synthetic rubber has all the properties of natural rubber so far, each synthetic rubber has its unique properties that surpass natural rubber, such as wear resistance, high temperature resistance, elasticity at low temperatures, or oil resistance. For example, nitrile rubber can be used to make oil pipes and auxiliary fuel tanks for jet fighters, and polyisobutylene rubber can be used as cable insulation and chemical equipment lining. These are often not replaceable by natural rubber. Synthetic rubber is also made from coal and limestone or waste gas processed from petroleum. The production of synthetic rubber is much faster and requires less labor than the production of natural rubber. Therefore, in addition to the Soviet Union being the birthplace of the synthetic rubber industry, capitalist countries are also striving to develop the synthetic rubber industry while striving to monopolize rubber, an important strategic material. In 1954, the total world output of natural rubber was 1.8 million tons, while the United States produced 630,000 tons of synthetic rubber in the same year.

Synthetic Dye Industry

The synthetic dye industry is also an important sector of the organic synthesis chemical industry. Supplying the light industry with a large number of bright and durable dyes is one of the important material guarantees for improving the quality of daily-use industrial products and meeting the people's needs for life and culture. At the same time, it is of great significance to national defense construction. The synthetic dye industry also manufactures many intermediates, which are not only used to manufacture dyes, but also to manufacture dyeing auxiliaries, medicines, film and photography materials, rubber accelerators and antioxidants, and pesticides. Therefore, the dye industry is inextricably linked with the defense, plastics, paint, printing and dyeing, papermaking, film, food, leather and other industries, and directly affects their technological progress and development.

Synthetic Drug Industry

The pharmaceutical industry has the important responsibility of supplying the medical sector with various drugs to improve people's physical fitness and protect people's health. Synthetic drugs have gradually become the main source of medicines. In addition to common sulfonamide drugs, aspirin, etc., even various vitamins, antibiotics, hormones, etc., which were mostly obtained from biological products in the past, can now be mass-produced by synthetic methods. Thus, the development of the synthetic drug industry has opened up new possibilities for medical progress.

Basic Organic Synthesis Industry

The basic organic synthesis industry is the industry that provides raw materials to the above-mentioned sectors and other industrial sectors. Its main products include synthetic alcohol, acetic acid, methanol, higher alcohols, formaldehyde, acetone, phenolic fatty acids, etc. The development of the basic organic synthesis industry is not only closely related to the above-mentioned industries, but more importantly, it is of extremely great significance for saving edible raw materials. In the past, products such as alcohol, acetic acid, acetic anhydride, acetone, and butanol were all made by grain fermentation. In addition, edible oils and fats were also used to make soap and industrial fatty acids, lubricating oils, and hardened oils. With the development of industry, more and more food is used for technical purposes. In our country, according to statistics, the edible oils and fats used for manufacturing soap alone reached more than 100,000 tons in 1955, which can be divided into five liang and three qian per person on average across the country. In today's tight supply of oils and fats, this is a large number. The development of the basic organic synthesis industry has made it possible to no longer use food to manufacture the above-mentioned products, but to directly synthesize them from coal, limestone, natural gas, petroleum waste gas, and paraffin.

To sum up the above, it can be seen that the organic synthesis chemical industry can use the cheapest and most abundant raw materials to manufacture thousands of inexpensive and high-quality items to maximize the needs of people's food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and solve the difficulties of insufficient natural resources. It occupies a very important position in the national economy and people's lives.

The Direction of the Development of the Organic Synthesis Chemical Industry in Our Country

The current situation of the organic synthesis chemical industry in our country is as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the Political Report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Eighth National Congress: "... the organic synthesis chemical industry hardly exists".

At present, the output of plastics in our country is very low, only about 10,000 tons. Some raw materials, such as formaldehyde and styrene monomer, still rely on imports, and there are only a few types of products, such as phenolic plastics and celluloid. Small-scale pilot production of polyvinyl chloride and plexiglass has only begun in recent years. Plastic processing equipment is relatively backward, mostly hand-pressed. Therefore, the existing plastic production cannot meet the growing needs of all parties in terms of variety, quantity, and quality. The synthetic fiber and man-made fiber industry and the synthetic rubber industry have yet to be established. The development of the synthetic dye industry and the synthetic drug industry is also just beginning. In addition to the production of sulfide dyes and some azo dyes, we will be able to produce several high-grade dyes such as indanthrene and an'an blue, and a number of important dye intermediates by ourselves after 1957.

In order to strive to strengthen the establishment of the organic synthesis chemical industry, in the basic organic synthesis industry, in addition to striving to use petroleum gas, coke oven gas and natural gas, we are prepared to vigorously develop the organic synthesis industry based on calcium carbide and water gas. The organic synthesis industries of the Soviet Union and the United States mainly use petroleum gas as raw material, which is the most economical for the Soviet Union, which produces 70 million tons of petroleum annually. China's petroleum industry is still relatively backward, and resources are waiting to be explored. However, China is extremely rich in coal reserves, limestone is inexhaustible, and cheap hydropower can also be obtained. Therefore, it is more realistic to manufacture a series of products from calcium carbide gas (secondly, water gas) in the organic synthesis industry.

In terms of the plastics industry, we are prepared to focus our efforts on organizing the production of polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, cellulose acetate, and amino plastics. Secondly, we will organize the production and trial production of plexiglass, polyethylene plastic organic silicon, fluorine-containing plastics and other new varieties of plastics. The importance of polyvinyl chloride plastic is becoming more and more significant, and it can also be copolymerized with other synthetic fibers. It should be placed at the forefront of the current development of the plastic industry.

In terms of the synthetic fiber industry, we will first vigorously develop poly-amide fibers (capron and nylon), because the raw materials used are relatively easy to solve, and our technology in this area is more mature, so development is more realistic. In addition, we must actively carry out research on polyacrylonitrile and polyester synthetic fibers.

In terms of the synthetic rubber industry, we will focus on developing styrene-butadiene rubber and study the method of obtaining butadiene from synthetic alcohol or the butene-butane fraction in petroleum gas. Secondly, mastering the production process of chloroprene rubber using calcium carbide as raw material and gradually expanding its production is also of great significance.

The main problem in the synthetic dye industry is to actively organize research and trial production to increase new varieties. The basic construction investment in this area is prepared to be used centrally to increase the production of intermediates and some high-grade dyes.

In terms of the synthetic drug industry, we will mainly continue to vigorously develop antibiotics and sulfonamide drugs with special curative effects and wide applications, strengthen the research and trial production of new types of products, and establish production departments for antipyretic drugs, vitamins and other effective chemically synthesized drugs.

Issues that should be paid attention to in the development of the organic synthesis chemical industry

The main raw materials of the organic synthesis chemical industry are coal, coke, coke oven gas, petroleum waste gas, natural gas, etc. Therefore, close cooperation with other industrial sectors and comprehensive utilization of resources are of particular importance.

The by-product waste gas produced during petroleum processing was often burned as fuel in the past, but it is of great value to the chemical industry and can be used to manufacture a series of products such as synthetic alcohol, synthetic rubber, solvents, plastics, and synthetic fibers. With the development of the peaceful use of atomic energy, atomic energy will replace a large amount of petroleum used as fuel. It is expected that in the near future, petroleum will be used exclusively for the manufacture of chemical industry products. At present, it is very necessary to first use the waste gas generated by petroleum processing. In addition, petroleum industry paraffin can be used to manufacture synthetic fatty acids and detergents.

Coke oven gas, a by-product of coking in the metallurgical industry, was also used as fuel in the past, or even not used. For example, using the hydrogen in coke oven gas to manufacture synthetic ammonia and synthetic methanol can not only reduce basic construction costs, but also reduce the production cost of synthetic ammonia by an average of about 30%. Coke oven gas contains about 2% ethylene, which is equivalent to 0.375% of the weight of the processed coal. If China uses 10 million tons of coal for coking every year in the future, a large amount of ethylene can be extracted, and ethylene is a very important raw material for the organic synthesis chemical industry.

The chemical industry and the electric power industry can also comprehensively utilize resources. It is a great pity to use coal directly to generate electricity. If the coal is semi-coked first, the generated tar is a source of raw materials for the organic synthesis chemical industry. Semi-coke can be used for power generation. In East Germany ten years ago, 60% of the coal was used for heating or power generation, but now it has dropped to about 34%.

Natural gas is also a huge source of raw materials for manufacturing synthetic ammonia, synthetic rubber, plastics, alcohols, ethers and other products.

In addition, special attention should also be paid to the comprehensive utilization of raw materials, waste materials, and by-products of the chemical industry itself.

Scientific research plays an important role in promoting production, especially in the organic synthesis chemical industry. Due to the rapid achievements of organic synthesis chemistry and polymer chemistry, new synthetic materials and production processes are constantly emerging, and we must also study suitable product varieties and production methods based on the specific conditions of our country's resources. In this way, we must vigorously strengthen the scientific research work of the organic synthesis industry.

    开辟化学工业的新的领域——有机合成化学工业
    化学工业部副部长　张珍
    有机合成化学工业的重要
    中国共产党第八次全国代表大会关于发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的建议指出，要特别建立有机合成化学工业。
    什么是有机合成化学呢？
    我们知道，自然界中的碳氢化合物和化学构造复杂的物质不下数十万种，它们过去都是天然生成的，或是由动物植物中取得的。由于利用化学方法知道了它们的组成和构造，就有可能用合成的办法从最简单的原料来取得它们。随着工业技术的发展，化学工业的任务就不仅是把天然物质用合成的方法大量制造出来，更重要的是制造出自然界中所没有的，性能比天然物质更符合现代技术要求的新的物质。所有这些用合成方法，从最简单的原料制造碳氢化合物或化学构造复杂的物质的工业，就是有机合成化学工业。
    有机合成化学工业有下面几个主要部门：
    塑料工业
    塑料是一种很重要的合成材料。由于它具有轻巧、强度高、透明美观、绝缘、抗化学侵蚀等优良特性，因此几乎被广泛地应用到一切工业和日用品中。它可以大量代替金属，特别是代替有色金属，用来制造飞机、汽车及其他机器设备的部件和零件。有人看到目前某些国家手工压制的塑料制品强度不大，便以为塑料只能用于负荷不高的零件；实际上用大型水压机压制的塑料制品，特别是某些优质塑料，可以具有极大的抗张强度，因而可以用作齿轮、制动器和诸如轧钢机等重型机器上的轴承。一吨塑料平均可以代替三吨有色金属，这样就可以节省大量有色金属用于最必需的地方。而建立塑料工厂所需要的投资和时间，远比发展有色金属工业（包括采矿）所需要的时间少得多。采用塑料制品还可大大减低机器的重量，一辆汽车由于采用塑料大约可以减轻半吨自重量。塑料不仅可以代替金属，而且某些特性比金属更好。塑料机件转动时没有什么响声，纺织车间采用塑料齿轮和纱锭等，可以减少车间的噪音。塑料做的轴比合金的更耐磨，使用寿命比有色金属的长六倍，还不用润滑。塑料的绝缘性能很高，是电气工业的良好材料，特别是聚乙烯塑料和硅有机塑料，能在高温和低温下保持绝缘性能，更是电力工业和无线电工业技术发展所不可缺少的。至于日用品，如食用器皿、电影胶片、唱片等，几乎无一不可以用塑料制造。因此，塑料工业在国民经济中占有很重要的地位。全世界塑料的产量增长很快，1950年全世界塑料约一百万吨，1954年即增到二百万吨以上。
    合成纤维工业
    合成纤维和人造纤维是纺织工业的重要原料，合成纤维是用塑料加工制成，人造纤维则以天然纤维（如木材藁杆）为原料制成。人们在应用“尼隆”、“卡普隆”和人造丝制的日用品如衬衣、袜子中已熟悉了合成纤维和人造纤维坚牢耐用的特性。由于合成纤维不怕水、耐腐蚀、不受光和气候的影响，弹性和强度又超过一切天然纤维和强力人造丝，因此是不可缺少的工业用纤维。例如用合成纤维做橡胶轮胎的帘布层，才能抵抗喷气式飞机和重型轰炸机着陆时的冲力，并可使通常汽车轮胎的厚度减薄，寿命延长一倍以上，从而节省大量的橡胶。合成纤维是用煤、苯和石油废气、农产废品（如糠醛）制成的，人造纤维是用木材藁杆制成的。一吨苯酚或三吨木材就可制出一万五千双女袜，价格很便宜。如以生丝价格为一百元，合成纤维只有二十至四十元，人造丝价格只十元。随着技术的改进和采用廉价原料，合成纤维的成本还在不断下降。因为合成和人造纤维的上述优点，加上它的生产不受耕地和气候的限制，因此发展很快，近二十年来资本主义世界棉花只增加了30％，但1954年合成和人造纤维的产量就比1940年增加了十倍。
    合成橡胶工业
    合成橡胶工业的发展，也有重要的经济意义和战略意义。合成橡胶的品种很多，虽然至今还没有一种合成橡胶具有天然橡胶的所有性能，但每一种合成橡胶都有它的独特的胜过天然橡胶的性能，如耐磨、耐高温、在低温下保持弹性或耐油等。例如丁晴橡胶可用来做油管、喷气歼击机副油箱，聚异丁烯橡胶可用作电缆绝缘和化学设备衬里。这些往往不是天然橡胶所能代替的。合成橡胶也是用煤和石灰石或石油加工的废气作原料造成的，生产合成橡胶要比生产天然橡胶快得多，花费劳力也少得多。因此除苏联是合成橡胶工业的发源地以外，资本主义各国在争取垄断橡胶这一重要的战备物资的同时，也在尽力发展合成橡胶工业，1954年世界天然橡胶的总产量为一百八十万吨，而同年美国即生产合成橡胶六十三万吨。
    合成染料工业
    合成染料工业也是有机合成化学工业的重要部门之一。供应轻工业以大量鲜艳坚牢的染料，是提高日用工业品质量，满足人民生活和文化需要的重要物质保证之一。同时，和国防建设有重大关系。合成染料工业同时还制造许多中间体，不仅用以制造染料，还可制造染色助剂、医药、电影照像材料、橡胶促进剂和防老剂以及农药等。因此，染料工业与国防、塑料、油漆、印染、造纸、电影、食品、皮革等工业有不可分离的联系，并直接影响它们的技术进步和发展。
    合成药物工业
    医药工业负有供应医疗部门以各种药物，来增进人民体质，维护人民健康的重大责任。而合成药物已日渐成为医药的主要来源，除常见的磺胺类药品、阿斯匹林等外，甚至像过去多是从生物制品取得的各种维生素，抗生素，荷尔蒙等，也都可以用合成方法大量制造了，这样，合成药物工业的发展，就为医学进步开辟了新的可能性。
    基本有机合成工业
    基本有机合成工业，是给上述各部门以及其他工业部门提供原料的工业。它的主要产品有合成酒精、醋酸、甲醇、高级醇、甲醛、丙酮、苯酚脂肪酸等等。发展基本有机合成工业，不但对上述各项工业有着密切关系，更重要的是对于节约食用原料有着极其重大的意义。过去像酒精、醋酸、醋酐、丙酮、丁醇等产品，都是用粮食醱酵制成的，此外还要用可供食用的油脂去做肥皂和工业用脂肪酸、润滑油、硬化油等。随着工业的发展，用于技术目的的食品越来越多了。在我国，据统计仅用于制造肥皂的食用油脂，1955年即达十万吨以上，以全国人口平均，每人可分得五两三钱，在油脂供应紧张的今天，这是一个很大的数字，基本有机合成工业的发展，已经有可能不再用食品来制造上述这些产品，而直接用煤、石灰石、天然气、石油废气、石腊来合成了。
    综合以上情况，可以看出，有机合成化学工业能以最廉价和最丰富的原料制造出千万种价廉物美的物品，来最大限度地满足人民食、衣、住、行的需要，解决某些天然资源不足的困难，因而在国民经济和人民生活中占着很重要的地位。
    我国有机合成化学工业发展的方向
    我国有机合成化学工业的现状，正如刘少奇同志的中国共产党中央委员会向第八次全国代表大会的政治报告中所指出：“……有机合成化学工业几乎还没有”。
    目前，我国塑料的产量很低，仅一万吨左右，其中部分原料如甲醛及苯乙烯单体等，还依靠进口，产品品种也只有酚醛塑料、赛璐珞等几种，近年来才开始少量聚氯乙烯和有机玻璃的中间试验生产；塑料加工设备比较落后，大多是手工压制的。因此，现有塑料生产不论品种上、数量上、质量上都还不能满足各方面日益增长的需要。合成纤维和人造纤维工业和合成橡胶工业尚有待建立。合成染料工业和合成药物工业的发展也正在开始，除已生产硫化染料和部分偶氮染料外，1957年以后我们才可以自己生产阴丹士林、安安蓝等几种高级染料和若干重要的染料中间体。
    为了努力加强有机合成化学工业的建立。在基本有机合成工业方面，除努力争取利用石油气、焦炉气和天然气以外，我们准备大力发展以电石和水煤气为基础的有机合成工业。苏联和美国的有机合成工业主要是用石油气作原料的，对于年产七千万吨石油的苏联来说，这是最经济不过的。中国石油工业还比较落后，资源正待勘探。但是，我国煤的蕴藏极富，石灰石也取之不尽，廉价的水电也可以获得，因而从电石气（其次是水煤气）出发，制造一系列产品的有机合成工业是比较现实的。
    塑料工业方面，我们准备以主要力量组织聚氯乙烯、聚苯乙烯、醋酸纤维和氨基塑料的生产。其次是组织有机玻璃、聚乙烯塑料有机矽、合氟塑料及其他新品种塑料的生产和试制。聚氯乙烯塑料的重要性越来越显著，它还可以与其他合成纤维共聚合，应该摆到当前塑料工业发展的首位。
    合成纤维工业方面，首先大力发展多醯胺类纤维（卡普隆和尼龙），因为它们所用的原料比较容易解决，我们在这方面的技术也较成熟，发展起来是比较现实的。另外还要积极进行聚丙烯睛和聚酯类合成纤维等的研究。
    合成橡胶工业方面，我们以发展丁苯橡胶为主，研究用合成酒精或石油气中的丁烯丁烷馏分来取得丁二烯的方法。其次，掌握以电石为原料的氯丁橡胶的生产工艺，逐步扩大它的生产，也有很重要的意义。
    合成染料工业的方面的主要问题是，积极组织研究和试制生产，增加新的品种。这方面的基本建设投资，准备集中使用于增加中间体及部分高级染料的生产。
    合成药物工业方面，主要是继续大力发展疗效特殊、用途广泛的抗生素、磺胺类药品，加强新种类产品的研究和试制工作，建立解热药、维生素及其他有效的化学合成药品的生产部门。
    发展有机合成化学工业应注意的问题
    有机合成化学工业的主要原料是煤、焦、焦炉气、石油废气、天然气等，因此，和其他工业部门密切协作，综合利用资源，就有着特别重要的意义。
    石油加工时所产生的副产废气，过去往往拿它作燃料烧掉，但它对化学工业却有很大的价值，可以制造出合成酒精、合成橡胶、溶剂、塑料、合成纤维等一系列的产品。随着原子能的和平利用的发展，原子能将代替大量作为燃料的石油，可以期望不久的将来石油将专为制造化学工业产品之用。目前首先利用处理石油所产生的废气是十分必要的。此外还可利用石油工业石腊制造合成脂肪酸和洗涤剂。
    冶金工业炼焦副产焦炉气，过去也是当作燃料、甚至不加利用的。如利用焦炉气中的氢制造合成氨和合成甲醇，不但可以减少基本建设费用，还可使合成氨生产成本平均降低30％左右。焦炉气中含有2％左右的乙烯，约相当于被处理的煤的重量的0.375％，我国将来每年用于炼焦的煤达千万吨，就可提取大量的乙烯，而乙烯正是有机合成化学工业的一个极重要的原料。
    化学工业和电力工业也可综合利用资源。用煤直接发电是非常可惜的。如果先将煤半焦化，产生的焦油是有机合成化学工业的原料泉源。半焦则可供发电。民主德国在十年前有60％的煤是用来发热或发电，现在已降至34％左右了。
    天然气也是制造合成氨、合成橡胶、塑料、醇类、醚类等产品的巨大原料来源。
    此外化学工业本身的原料、废料、副产品的综合利用，也应特别加以注意。
    科学研究工作对生产起着重要的推动工作，对于有机合成化学工业尤为明显。由于有机合成化学和高分子化学的日新月异的成就，新的合成材料和生产工艺不断出现，我们又必须根据我国的资源情况等具体条件，研究适合的产品品种和生产方法。这样就必须大力加强有机合成工业的科学研究工作。
