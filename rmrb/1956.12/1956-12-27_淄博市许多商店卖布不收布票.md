    Many cotton cloth sales units in Zibo City, Shandong Province, have not strictly implemented the system of supplying cotton cloth with ration coupons, and some have even deliberately undermined this system. The Zhangdian Store of Zibo City Department Store sold ready-made clothes made of more than 100,000 chi of cloth in September and October this year, but only collected more than 20,000 chi of cloth ration coupons, leaving more than 80,000 chi of cloth ration coupons unaccounted for. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Commerce before November 25 this year, cloth remnants of six chi or less are exempt from cloth ration coupons. The 501 Factory Store of Zibo City Trading Company deliberately tore 30 bolts of whole cloth into pieces of six chi each for promotion. The various sales departments in Boshan District often sell cloth to people who do not bring cloth ration coupons. Sometimes, some customers take a fancy to the cloth, but because they do not have cloth ration coupons, they cannot buy it. However, the salesperson encourages the customer by saying, "It doesn't matter, buy it! You can just send the cloth ration coupons later." In reality, very few cloth ration coupons are returned.
    It is hoped that the relevant departments in Zibo City will immediately check and stop this phenomenon and implement the policy of unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth. Li Xun

    淄博市许多商店卖布不收布票
    山东省淄博市的许多棉布销售单位，没有严格执行凭票供应棉布的制度，有的甚至还故意破坏这个制度。淄博市百货公司张店商店，在今年9、10两个月内，共售出十万多尺布的成衣，可是只收回两万多尺布票，其余八万多尺布票没有着落。按照商业部今年11月25日以前的规定，六市尺以下的布头免收布票，淄博市贸易公司五○一厂商店，就曾将三十匹整布，故意撕成六尺一块的布头推销。博山区各门市部，经常把布卖给没有带布票的人。有时一些顾客看中了布，因为没有带布票，本来不能买，但是营业员反而鼓励顾客说：“不要紧，买吧！以后你想着把布票送来就行。”实际上，送回布票的很少。
    希望淄博市的有关部门立即检查制止这种现象，贯彻棉布统购统销政策。　李汛
