    Harbin Steam Turbine Plant Under Intense Construction

    The largest steam turbine currently manufactured in China has a capacity of 12,000 kilowatts. Once this plant is completed, it will be able to manufacture large steam turbines with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts or more. In conjunction with the Harbin Boiler Factory and the Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory, it will produce complete sets of large thermal power equipment.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 24th: A large-scale steam turbine manufacturing plant, the Harbin Steam Turbine Plant, is under construction in Harbin City. This huge, modern factory, after more than two years of preparatory work, entered full-scale construction in the second half of this year. Currently, thousands of construction workers are braving the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius to carry out winter construction.

    The plan is for this factory to basically complete the construction of plant buildings and the installation of some major equipment by the end of 1957. Efforts will be made to trial-produce the first 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine in 1959.

    The Harbin Steam Turbine Plant is designed with Soviet assistance, and the main equipment is also supplied by the Soviet Union. The design incorporates the most advanced Soviet steam turbine manufacturing technology. Once completed, this factory will cooperate with the Harbin Boiler Factory and the Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory to produce complete sets of power generation equipment for national construction of thermal power plants. The largest steam turbine currently manufactured in China has a capacity of 12,000 kilowatts, which cannot meet the country's needs for large steam turbines. After the Harbin Steam Turbine Plant is completed, it will mainly manufacture large high-pressure, high-temperature steam turbines with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts or more.

    To accelerate the construction of the Harbin Steam Turbine Plant, the state has decided to change the original plan of building the plant in two phases to building it in one phase. This will advance the construction speed of the Harbin Steam Turbine Plant by more than two years. (Attached picture)

    哈尔滨汽轮机厂紧张施工
    我国目前制造的最大的汽轮机是一万二千瓩。这个工厂建成后，将能制造二万五千瓩以上的大型汽轮机。它和哈尔滨锅炉厂、哈尔滨电机厂配合起来，将生产成套的大型火力发电设备。
    新华社哈尔滨24日电　我国正在哈尔滨市兴建一座大型的汽轮机制造厂——哈尔滨汽轮机厂。这座规模巨大的现代化工厂，经过两年多的建厂准备，在今年下半年进入全面施工。现在，几千名建筑工人正在冒着摄氏零下二十多度的严寒进行冬季施工。
    这座工厂计划在1957年年底基本完成厂房建筑和部分主要设备的安装工程。争取在1959年试制出第一台二万五千瓩的汽轮机。
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂是苏联帮助设计的，主要设备也是苏联供应的。设计中采用了苏联最先进的汽轮机制造技术。这座工厂建成以后，将配合哈尔滨锅炉厂、哈尔滨电机厂生产成套的发电设备供给国家建设火力发电站。我国目前制造的最大的汽轮机是一万二千瓩，还不能满足国家对大型汽轮机的需要。哈尔滨汽轮机厂建成以后，主要是制造二万五千瓩以上的高压、高温的大型汽轮机。
    为了加速哈尔滨汽轮机厂的建设，国家已经决定把这个厂原订分两期建成的计划改为一次建成。这样，哈尔滨汽轮机厂的建设速度可以提前两年多。（附图片）
