    Guizhou Provincial Organs to Streamline Institutions;
    Merger of Two Banks' Offices Expected to Reduce Eight Hundred People

    (Reported by our newspaper) According to the New Guizhou Daily news: The leading members of the departments and committees of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the various departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee have all studied the steps and requirements for increasing production and practicing economy in their respective units. After mobilization, most units are conducting discussions and inspections among all staff members. A small number of units have already begun adjusting their office space.

    After preliminary inspections, various units believe that the overstaffing and overlapping of institutions urgently needs to be changed. The Guizhou Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China can reduce its total staff by approximately 40%. Without affecting work, merging the offices of the Provincial Agricultural Bank and the People's Bank can reduce approximately eight hundred people. The Meteorological Bureau can reduce its total staff by approximately one-third. Several departments of the Provincial People's Committee share one building, and merging the printing and typing facilities can also reduce personnel. At the same time, all units believe that in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, a portion of office space can be vacated. The Provincial People's Bank, the Commercial Department, and the Grain Department can all adjust and provide housing for another unit. Most units have initially examined the waste of operating expenses and office expenses. While examining the waste phenomena, all units are also studying ways to improve work in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.

    贵州省级机关将精简机构
    两个银行合并办公约可减少八百人
    本报讯　据新黔日报消息：中共贵州省委各部委和省人民委员会各厅局的领导成员，都已研究了本单位增产节约的步骤和要求。大多数单位经过动员后正在全体工作人员中进行讨论和检查。少数单位已开始调整房屋。
    各单位经过初步检查，认为人员过多和机构重叠情况亟需改变。中国人民银行贵州省分行机关大约可减少总人数的40％左右。在不影响工作的情况下，省农业银行和人民银行合并办公，大约可减少八百人。气象局大约可减少总人数的三分之一。省人民委员会几个厅共住一幢楼房，文印打字机构合并也能减少人员。同时各单位都认为根据增产节约精神，可以腾出一部分办公房屋。省人民银行和商业厅、粮食厅都可以调整出一个单位用的房子来。各单位大都初步检查了事业费和机关办公费的浪费现象。在检查浪费现象的同时，各单位都根据增产节约精神研究改进工作的问题。
