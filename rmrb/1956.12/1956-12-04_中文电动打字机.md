    Chinese Electric Typewriter
    (Xinhua News Agency) A nimble Chinese electric typewriter has begun production at the Shenyang Fourth Machinery Repair and Production Cooperative.
    This typewriter is relatively easy to operate and highly efficient. An average typewriter can type about thirty-two Chinese characters per minute, while this electric typewriter can type fifty Chinese characters per minute. When using it, you only need to lightly press the small electric button on the typewriter to type a character.
    This electric typewriter was successfully developed by a technician from the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute in his spare time of over four months.

    中文电动打字机
    据新华社讯　一种灵巧的中文电动打字机在沈阳第四机械修配生产合作社开始生产。
    这种打字机操作起来比较灵便而且效率较高。一般打字机平均每分钟约能打出三十二个汉字，这种电动打字机每分钟能打出五十个汉字。使用时只要在打字机的小电扭上轻轻一按便可以打出字来。
    这种电动打字机是由沈阳煤矿设计院的技术员用四个多月的业余时间研究成功的。
