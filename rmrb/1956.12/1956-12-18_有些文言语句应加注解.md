    Some Classical Chinese Sentences Should Be Annotated
    The author of the article "The Splendor of Language" published in the People's Daily on November 8 cited several Classical Chinese sentences in the text, and provided explanations after each of them. I don't think it's superfluous to do so. I hope that authors will add necessary annotations after difficult-to-understand Classical Chinese sentences. (Wen Guangyan)

    有些文言语句应加注解
    人民日报11月8日登载的“语言的光辉”一文的作者，在文中引用了几个文言语句，后面都注有解释，我觉得这样做不算多余。希望作者在不易懂得的文言语句之后，加上必要的注解。  （温广彦）
