    Leading Small Factories According to Their Characteristics
    Tian Dan
    Recently, industrial leadership departments in many cities have strengthened their leadership over jointly owned public-private small factories. This is a good phenomenon. However, a new problem deserves attention: that is, some places are not leading small factories according to their characteristics, but are mechanically copying the methods of leading large factories.
    Some industrial leadership departments in Wuxi City are like this. Generally, the report forms required of large factories are also required of small factories. Some cadres in small factories reflect, "When filling out report forms, the only difference between us small factories and large factories is that our numbers are smaller and we draw fewer circles!" Generally, if large factories are required to send people to participate in meetings, small factories are also required to send people. Some cadres in small factories complain, "The only difference between us small factories and large factories when participating in meetings is that large factories have several people in one position, and send Zhang San to this meeting today and Li Si to that meeting tomorrow; but we small factories have one person in several positions, so Zhang San goes today, Zhang San goes tomorrow, and Zhang San goes the day after tomorrow!" Even some large factories feel that there are too many meetings and report forms, so small factories naturally find it even more difficult to cope.
    In the Wuxi City Joint Public-Private Wan Tai Electro-Chemical Bleaching Powder Factory, there are eleven management personnel among the thirty-six employees. However, despite the large number of management personnel, it is still impossible to manage production well, because most of the time is spent busy coping with the report forms issued and the meetings convened by higher authorities. The Planning and Finance Section alone has seventy-four kinds of report forms to be made daily, every ten days, or monthly (only four kinds before the joint public-private ownership). The head of the Personnel, Security, Labor, and Wages Section alone participated in meetings outside for a full seven days in the first half of November (and was unable to attend some meetings due to being swamped).
    Some small factories that were just beginning to show progress in production have actually collapsed due to the "strengthened leadership" of higher authorities. After the Wuxi City Joint Public-Private Tongxin Cloth Factory was rated as an advanced factory in the second quarter of this year, relevant departments at higher levels all reached out for summaries. A set of summaries was required for everything from political and ideological work, quality inspection work, mechanical maintenance work to cafeteria work, totaling eleven sets. The factory director, Party branch secretary, and other cadres were all newly promoted from among the workers, with low levels of education, and there was no secretary in the factory to do the work for them. Therefore, they were busy day and night preparing summaries. After they were done, the higher authorities looked at them and were not satisfied, so they reworked them. As for production, they couldn't pay much attention to it. As a result, after spending two months, the summaries were not yet "successfully completed," but production in the factory collapsed, and it was not rated as an advanced factory in the third quarter.
    As the saying goes: What key opens what lock, what size shoe fits what size foot. To lead industrial production, we must oppose the generalized leadership methods that make no distinction between large and small factories. Small factories generally have a small production scale and poor conditions. This characteristic must be fully noted. In order to improve the enterprise management of small factories, establish regular leadership over the production of small factories, necessary report forms and meetings, and even summaries, are of course indispensable, but unnecessary ones should be greatly reduced.

### 按小厂特点领导小厂

    按小厂特点领导小厂
    田丹
    最近，许多城市的工业领导部门加强了对公私合营小型工厂的领导。这是好现象。但是，有一个新的问题值得引起注意：这就是有些地方没有根据小厂的特点来领导小厂，而是机械地照搬领导大厂的一套。
    无锡市有些工业领导部门就是这样的。凡是要大厂造的报表，一般也要小厂造。有的小厂干部反映“填报表，我们小厂同大厂不同的，只是我们数字小，少画几个圈圈！”凡是要大厂派人参加的会议，一般也要小厂派人参加。有的小厂干部诉苦：“参加会议，我们小厂同大厂不同的，是大厂一职数人，今天这个会派张三参加，明天那个会派李四参加；可是我们小厂一人数职，今天是张三去，明天也是张三去，后天还是张三去！”对于会议、报表，有些大厂都感到过多，小厂自然更加难以招架。
    无锡市公私合营万泰电化漂粉厂三十六名职工中，管理人员倒有十一人。但是尽管管理人员多，还是无法管理好生产，原因是大部分时间要为应付上级发的报表和召开的会议而忙碌。仅计划财务课一个课，要按日、按旬或按月造的各式报表就有七十四种（公私合营前只四种）。仅人事保卫劳动工资课课长一个人，在11月上半月到外面就参加了整整七天的会议（有的会还无法抽身参加）。
    有的小厂原来生产刚刚有起色，竟被上级“加强领导”而垮下来了。无锡市公私合营同新布厂今年第二季度被评为优胜厂后，上级各有关部门都伸手要总结。从政治思想工作、质量检验工作、机械保养工作到食堂工作等等都要各搞一套总结，共十一套。厂长、党支部书记等一些干部都是新从工人中提拔的，文化程度低，厂内又无秘书可以代劳。因此，日夜忙搞总结，搞好了上级看看不满意，又返工重搞，至于生产则无法多加过问。结果，花了两个月时间，总结还没有“大功告成”，厂里生产却垮下来，第三季度没有评上优胜。
    俗话说：什么钥匙开什么锁，多大鞋子配多大脚。领导工业生产，必须反对大厂小厂毫无区别的一般化的领导方法。小厂一般生产规模小、条件差。这一特点，必须充分地注意到。为了改进小厂的企业管理，对小厂生产建立经常性的领导，必要的报表和会议以至总结等当然是不可缺少的，但不必要的则应大大减少。
