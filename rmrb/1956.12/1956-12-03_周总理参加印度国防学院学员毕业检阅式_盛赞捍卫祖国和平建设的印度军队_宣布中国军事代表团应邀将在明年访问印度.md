Xinhua News Agency, Pune, December 1st: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage arrived in Pune from New Delhi at noon today. This is the first stage of their four-thousand-mile journey in India. The Indian President's special plane transported the guests to this city, known for its military and educational institutions.

Those who welcomed them at the airport included: V.K. Sathe, Minister of Industry and Civil Supplies of the Bombay State Government; A.U. Shaikh, Revenue and Administrative Commissioner of Pune; T.R. Deogirikar, Chairman of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee; Major General P.N. Khipal, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Southern Command, and other military officers; prominent figures from Pune; and representatives of the overseas Chinese community. The welcomers presented the guests with garlands.

Accompanying Premier Zhou Enlai to Pune were Indian Ambassador to China R.K. Nehru and his wife, M.R. Baig, Chief of Protocol of the Indian Government's Ministry of External Affairs, and Chinese Ambassador to India Pan Zili.

Along the streets where Premier Zhou Enlai and his party's motorcade passed, stood large crowds of welcoming people. Huge banners were hung on the streets, reading: "Long Live Panchsheel! Long Live Sino-Indian Friendship!"

Premier Zhou Enlai will visit the National Defence Academy and several construction projects in this summer capital of Bombay State, which has a population of 500,000.

Xinhua News Agency, Khadakwasla Military Camp, Pune, December 2nd: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long attended the grand graduation review of the fourth graduating class of the Indian National Defence Academy near Pune on the afternoon of December 1st. Prime Minister Nehru had reviewed the first graduating class at this academy in June last year.

Six hundred army, navy, and air force cadets in smart uniforms marched past the reviewing stand, where Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and the Commandant of the National Defence Academy, Major General Habibullah, were standing. Jet fighters roared overhead. The national flags of India and China fluttered on the very tall flagpole in the area called the "quarterdeck," where naval cadets are trained. Residents of Pune and nearby areas, dressed in festive attire, watched the review with great interest. The national anthems of China and India were played at the beginning and end of the review.

After the review, Premier Zhou Enlai presented the Indian President's gold medal and other medals to the most outstanding cadets.

Premier Zhou Enlai addressed the cadets, congratulating them on completing their three years of study. He said that the armies of India and China have the responsibility to safeguard the peaceful construction of their respective homelands and to defend world peace. He further said, "They are for self-defense and not for aggression." This is because China and India are two peace-loving countries. He praised the Indian army for its heroic struggle against fascism. He recalled the assistance given by the Indian people to China during the Chinese resistance against Japanese aggression and made special mention of the contributions of the young Indian doctor Dwarkanath Kotnis, who gave his life for China. He announced that China had accepted the invitation of the Indian government to send a military delegation to visit India next year.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that, just as the two countries are currently learning from each other in industry and other fields, they must also learn from each other in military affairs.

That evening, Premier Zhou Enlai also attended the National Defence Academy's celebratory banquet. At the banquet, while addressing nearly fifteen hundred cadets and senior military officers, he said that the armed forces of India and China, after achieving their independence, are currently defending the independence of their homelands and safeguarding world peace. This remark evoked prolonged cheers and applause.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that there are two types of armed forces – one that oppresses and intimidates the people, and another that protects the people. The former is an aggressive force, and the latter is a people's force. In the beginning, the aggressive force may seem stronger, and the people's force may seem weaker, but in the course of the struggle, the aggressive force is destined to fail, while the people's force becomes invincible. In this regard, he reminded the audience of Sun Yat-sen's famous saying: If the armed forces establish close ties with the people and become the people's armed forces, such armed forces are invincible.

Premier Zhou Enlai highly praised the Indian armed forces and lauded the curriculum of the Indian National Defence Academy, which includes military training, science, technology, democratic life, and military discipline. He said that the Chinese military delegation, which will visit India, can learn many things from India.

His speech was repeatedly interrupted by cheers, and at one point, rhythmic applause continued for a considerable period of time.

Premier Zhou Enlai also presented prizes to outstanding cadets, one of whom was the cadet with the best grades in Chinese.

Later, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long, accompanied by Commandant Habibullah, went to each table to freely converse with the students.

Earlier on December 1st, after arriving in Pune from Delhi, the Chinese dignitaries were immediately invited to attend a civic reception and luncheon held in their honor by the Pune municipal authorities. The reception was held in a beautifully decorated tent. Premier Zhou Enlai said that China hoped more Indian scholars would come to lecture at Chinese universities. He said that China also hoped to send more students to India, especially to Pune University, to study. These remarks elicited enthusiastic applause from the attendees, including many professors.

　  周总理参加印度国防学院学员毕业检阅式
　　盛赞捍卫祖国和平建设的印度军队
    宣布中国军事代表团应邀将在明年访问印度
    新华社浦那1日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员今天中午从新德里到达浦那。这是他们在印度作四千英里路程的旅行的第一阶段。印度总统的专机把客人们送到了这座以军事机构和教育机构著称的城市。
    到机场欢迎的有：孟买省政府工业民需部长符·克·萨特，浦那税务兼行政长官阿·乌·夏伊克，国大党马哈拉施特拉省委员会主席特·尔·德沃吉里卡，南方军区执行司令官普·纳·基帕尔少将和其他军官，浦那著名人士和华侨代表。欢迎者给客人们戴上了花环。
    陪同周恩来总理到浦那的有印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁和夫人，印度政府外交部礼宾司司长麦·鲁·巴伊格和中国驻印度大使潘自力。
    在周恩来总理一行所乘的汽车所通过的街道两旁，站着大批的欢迎群众，街道上悬挂着巨幅标语，上面写着：“潘查希拉万岁！中印友好万岁！”
    周恩来总理将在这个拥有五十万人口的孟买夏季省会参观国防学院和几项建设工程。
    新华社浦那卡达克瓦斯拉军营2日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理12月1日下午在浦那附近的印度国防学院参加了盛大的第四期学员毕业检阅式。去年6月，尼赫鲁总理曾经在这个学院检阅了第一期的毕业学员。
    六百名穿着漂亮的军服的陆、海、空军学员列队走过检阅台，检阅台上站着周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和国防学院院长哈比布拉少将。喷气式战斗机隆隆地凌空飞过。在海军学员受训的被叫做“后甲板”的地方很高的旗杆上飘扬着印、中两国的国旗。浦那和附近的居民都穿着节日的衣裳极感兴趣地观看检阅。在检阅开始和结束的时候，都演奏了中印两国国歌。
    在检阅结束以后，由周恩来总理把印度总统金质奖章和其他奖章授给最优秀的学员。
    周恩来总理向学员们讲了话，祝贺他们完成了三年的学业。他说，印中两国的军队负有保障他们各自祖国的和平建设和保卫世界和平的责任。他又说：“他们是自卫的，不是要进行侵略的。”这是因为中国和印度是两个爱好和平的国家。他赞扬印度军队对法西斯主义所进行的英勇斗争。他追述了印度人民在中国反对日本侵略的时候给予中国的援助，并且特别提到了为了中国而贡献出自己生命的青年印度医生柯棣华的功绩。他宣布，中国已经接受了印度政府的邀请，将要在明年派遣军事代表团访问印度。
    周恩来总理说，正像两国目前正在工业和其他方面互相学习那样，它们在军事方面也必须互相学习。
    当天晚上，周恩来总理又出席了国防学院的庆祝宴会。在宴会上他在向将近一千五百名学员和高级军官讲话的时候说，印中两国的武装部队在取得了它们的独立以后，目前正在保卫它们祖国的独立和捍卫世界和平。这番话引起了经久不息的欢呼声和人们击桌所表示的欢迎。
    周恩来总理说，武装部队有两种——一种是压迫和威吓人民的武装部队，另外一种是保护人民的武装部队。前一种是侵略部队，后一种是人民部队。开始的时候，侵略部队看来比较强，人民部队看来比较弱，但是在斗争的过程中，侵略部队注定要失败，而人民部队则成为不可战胜。在这方面，他向听众提到孙中山的名言：如果武装部队同人民发生了密切的联系，而成为人民的武装部队，这种武装部队就是不可战胜的。
    周恩来总理盛赞印度的武装部队，并且赞扬印度国防学院的课程，这些课程包括军事训练、科学、技术、民主生活以及军事纪律等。他说，将要访问印度的中国军事代表团可以从印度学到许多东西。
    他的演说一再为欢呼声打断，有一个时候，有节奏的鼓掌声继续了相当长的时间。
    周恩来总理还把奖品颁发给优秀的学员，其中有一个是中文成绩最好的学员。
    后来，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在院长哈比布拉少将的陪同下，到每一个桌子旁边，去同学生自由交谈。
    12月1日的早些时候，中国贵宾在从德里到达浦那后立即被邀请参加浦那市政机关为他们举行的市民欢迎会和午宴。欢迎会是在一个装饰得很美丽的帐篷中举行的。周恩来总理说，中国希望更多的印度学者到中国大学去讲学。他说，中国还希望派更多的学生到印度，特别是到浦那大学来留学。这番话引起了包括许多教授在内的到会者的热烈鼓掌。
