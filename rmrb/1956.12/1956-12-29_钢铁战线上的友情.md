    Friendship on the Steel Front
    Cao Ming

    Li Shangzhong and Kolesnikov’s friendship began with steelmaking, so their friendship is as strong as steel. Although when Li Shangzhong thought of Kolesnikov, he always thought about how to further shorten the steelmaking time in his open-hearth furnace; however, he couldn’t help but wonder: what are Kolesnikov's wife and children like, is his workshop the same as his own, and how beautiful is his homeland? Last October, when Kolesnikov came to Anshan, he invited him, "Please come to the Soviet Union and visit my home." He only regarded this sentence as a dream.

    This November, when the metallurgical industry trade union delegation visited the Soviet Union, Li Shangzhong was also invited to participate, and his dream came true.

    In Moscow, ah, he saw the red star of the Kremlin high into the deep gray early winter sky. Although he had seen these red stars countless times in movies and pictures, they were not as bright or as high as seeing them with his own eyes. Also, the Moscow University with more than twenty floors, and the ballet which was indescribably beautiful.... When a Chinese steelworker who deals with hard steel all day long saw a group of swans as light as white clouds and as soft as cotton wool, his heart couldn't help but float to the beautiful lake along with the gentle melody of the dance.

    After paying respects at the Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum, and especially after visiting the Lenin Museum, Li Shangzhong deeply felt that he had received a living lesson in internationalism. "At that time, there was nothing. Lenin established the first socialist country according to Marx's principles. As for us, our motherland has victoriously moved towards socialism. When else should our steelworkers work hard to make more steel and industrialize the motherland sooner?" Li Shangzhong thought to himself. With such excitement, he visited several steel cities in the Soviet Union and met his friend and teacher Kolesnikov at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works.

    Magnitogorsk is a famous steel plant in the Soviet Union. Especially during the Soviet Patriotic War, the workers made outstanding contributions to defending their motherland. At that time, the workers often said: "Two of the three shells that hit the fascists were made of steel from here." When Li Shangzhong and the delegation went in for a visit, they thought they had entered a garden. "Alas, our Anshan Steel doesn't even have room for a playground. Look here, such a large courtyard, with trees, flower beds, fountains, ball fields, libraries, clubs... everything." He exclaimed. The site was also very large, with three open-hearth furnace workshops, all kinds of rolling mills, and blast furnaces that were more than 1,300 cubic meters...

    Interestingly, the Ural River, the boundary river between Europe and Asia, connects this steel plant and the village. The steel plant is on the European side of the Ural River, and the village and residential area are on the Asian side of the Ural River. Li Shangzhong couldn't help but admire this beautiful river, which not only connects Europe and Asia, but also connects industry and agriculture.

    However, what Li Shangzhong could not forget the most was that he and Kolesnikov jointly made a furnace of steel in Magnitogorsk.

    When the two old partners met, they were so happy that they forgot everything and hugged each other tightly, as if nothing could separate them.

    "Ah, we once made a furnace of steel together in Anshan, and now we are making steel together again in Magnitogorsk," Li Shangzhong said enthusiastically.

    "Although we are in two countries and different cities, and thousands of miles apart, we are all fighting on the same front. Your achievements often encourage us," Kolesnikov replied sincerely.

    "After learning from your experience, our open-hearth furnace rapid steelmaking has averaged 40% to 45% of the total number of steelmaking furnaces. Now our furnaces are determined to complete the Five-Year Plan one year and one month ahead of schedule. This is inseparable from your help." They had already written to tell Kolesnikov these details, but now that they had met, he couldn't help but say it again affectionately.

    "No, this is all the manifestation of the Chinese steelworkers' enthusiasm for building their motherland and the high level of wisdom. I am merely introducing the experience of Soviet workers to you," Kolesnikov said modestly.

    Then they changed into their work clothes and went to the workshop. When Li Shangzhong saw this open-hearth furnace, it was exactly the same as his No. 1 open-hearth furnace, all automated. Looking again at the front and back of the furnace, it was much cleaner than ours. He secretly said "ashamed." Looking closely, he couldn't tell who was the foreman and who was the steelworker. He secretly thought: "In our workshop, those with their hands on their hips, or stretching their necks to look at the furnace roof through the doorway, must be steelworkers; whoever's work clothes are cleaner, that must be the foreman. Look at them, whether they are foremen or steelworkers, they are all doing the work." In this way, he remembered the excellent work style of others bit by bit in his heart.

    钢铁战线上的友情
    草明
    李尚忠和柯烈斯尼柯夫的友谊是从炼钢开始的，所以他们的友情也坚如钢铁。尽管李尚忠一想起柯烈斯尼柯夫的时候，就想到怎样在自己的平炉里把炼钢时间再缩短一些；但是，有时总免不了要想想：柯烈斯尼柯夫的太太和小孩们是怎么样的，他工作的车间是不是和自己的车间一样，他的祖国究竟怎么个漂亮法等等一连串的问题。去年10月里，柯烈斯尼柯夫来鞍山时，虽然邀请过他：“请你到苏联去，并且上我家串门子去。”他只把这句话当作梦想吧了。
    今年11月里，冶金业工会考察团去苏联访问时，李尚忠也被邀请参加，他的梦想变成了现实。
    在莫斯科时，啊，他看到了克里姆林宫的红五星高高地插入深灰色的初冬的天幕里，虽然在电影上，在画页里无数次看到过这几颗红星，但是究竟没有亲眼看的亮，没有亲眼看的高。还有，那二十多层高的莫斯科大学，那说不尽多么优美的芭蕾舞剧……。当一个成天和坚硬的钢铁打交道的中国炼钢工，看到了那一群轻盈得像白云，柔软得似棉绒的天鹅的时候，他的心情也禁不住随着那轻柔的舞蹈的旋律，飘到秀丽的湖边去了。
    瞻仰了列宁—斯大林墓，特别是参观了列宁博物馆，李尚忠深深感到自己上了一课活的国际主义的教育。“那个时候什么都没有，列宁按照马克思的原则，把第一个社会主义的国家建立起来了。我们呢，我们祖国已胜利地走向社会主义了，我们炼钢工人不好好地多炼钢，让祖国早点工业化，那还等什么时候？”李尚忠心里想道。他就在这样激动的心情下参观了苏联的几个钢铁的城市，并在马格尼托格斯克钢铁厂会见了他的朋友和老师柯烈斯尼柯夫的。
    马格尼托格斯克在苏联是个有名的钢铁厂。特别在苏联的卫国战争中，工人们对保卫祖国作出了卓越的贡献。那时工人们常说：“打中法西斯的三颗炮弹中，有两颗是我们这儿的钢做的。”当李尚忠和代表团进去参观的时候，以为自己走进花园里。“唉，咱们鞍钢，连个打球的场子也挤没有了。瞧这里，好大个院落，树木、花坛、喷水池、球场、图书馆、俱乐部……啥都有。”他赞叹着。现场也很大，平炉车间就有三个，有各色各样的轧钢车间，高炉都是一千三百多立方公尺的……
    有趣的是，欧洲和亚洲的分界河乌拉尔河把这个钢铁厂和农庄联系起来。钢铁厂在乌拉尔河欧洲的这一边，农庄和住宅在乌拉尔河亚洲的那一边。李尚忠不禁赞羡地望着这道美丽的河流，它不仅把欧亚两洲接连起来，也把工业和农业联系起来。
    但是，最最使李尚忠不能忘记的是，他和柯烈斯尼柯夫在马格尼托格斯克共同炼了一炉钢。
    这两个老搭当一见面时，高兴得忘记了一切地紧紧抱成一块，好像再没有什么东西把他们分得开来似地。
    “啊，我们曾经在鞍山共同炼了一炉钢，现在我们又在马格尼托格斯克一块儿炼钢了。”李尚忠热烈地说。
    “我们虽然在两个国家和不同的城市，也相隔好几千里，但是我们都是在一条战线上奋斗的。你们的成绩常常鼓舞着我们。”柯烈斯尼柯夫由衷地回答他。
    “我们打从你那儿学到经验后，我们平炉的快速炼钢平均达到出钢总炉数的40％到45％。现在我们的炉子决心争取提前一年零一个月完成五年计划。这都是和你的帮助分不开的。”这些情况，他们早就写信告诉过柯烈斯尼柯夫，不过现在见了面，他不由得亲热地再说一遍。
    “不，这都是中国钢铁工人建设祖国的积极性和智慧高度发挥出来的表现。我仅仅是把苏联工人的经验介绍给你们罢了。”柯烈斯尼柯夫谦逊地说。
    当下他们两个换了操作服，便到车间去了。李尚忠一看这个平炉，就和自己的一号平炉一样，全是自动化的。再看看炉前炉后，却比咱们的干净得多。他暗地里说了一声“惭愧”。他过细一看，哪一个是工长，哪一个是炼钢工，全看不出来。他暗暗想道：“在咱们车间，两手叉腰，或者伸着脖子往门洞里看望炉顶的，不用问，准是炼钢工；谁的操作服比较白净点的，那准是工长。看人家，不管是工长是炼钢工，都动手操作。”他就这样地把人家的优良作风一点一滴地记在心里。
