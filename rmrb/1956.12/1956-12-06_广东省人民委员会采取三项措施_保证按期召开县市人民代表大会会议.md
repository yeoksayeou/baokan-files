Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 4th. In response to a request from the Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee is currently working to correct the undesirable phenomenon of counties and cities failing to convene meetings of the People's Congress and the People's Committee on schedule.

The Guangdong Provincial People's Committee has decided to take three measures to strengthen guidance and supervision of city and county People's Committees in implementing the system of People's Congress meetings and the system of People's Committee meetings. The first of these three measures is: Each city and county People's Committee should, at its most recent meeting, conduct a comprehensive review of the meeting situation of the first People's Congress and the People's Committee of the city or county, and make corresponding resolutions. The results of the review and the content of the resolutions made by the city and county People's Committees should be included as part of the work report of the city and county People's Committees, reported to the most recently held city and county People's Congress meetings, and reported to the Provincial People's Committee.

The second measure is: In order to ensure the timely convening of People's Congress meetings and the lawful conduct of meeting work, each city and county must include central work in the agenda of the People's Congress meetings, and all levels of state organs and work departments should work to implement the resolutions of the People's Congresses. At the same time, leading personnel of city and county People's Committees are required to strengthen legal education for cadres, so that cadres establish a legal concept and ensure the implementation of the Constitution.

The third measure of the Provincial People's Committee stipulates: Establish a system of requesting instructions and reporting on the work of the city and county People's Congresses and People's Committee meetings. In the future, each city and county People's Committee must report the brief situation and resolutions of the meetings to the Provincial People's Committee within fifteen days after the People's Congress meeting and seven days after the People's Committee meeting.

The Provincial People's Committee has also decided that, when necessary, it will send staff to various places to supervise and inspect the implementation of these measures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 4th. The phenomenon of cities and counties in Guangdong Province failing to convene meetings of the People's Congress and the People's Committee on schedule is very serious. The Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate recently requested the Provincial People's Committee to correct this undesirable phenomenon, which violates the "Organic Law of the People's Congresses and the People's Committees at All Levels in the People's Republic of China," based on an inspection of one hundred and eleven cities and counties throughout the province.

According to the investigation by the Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate, the phenomenon of violating the Organic Law of the People's Congresses and the People's Committees at All Levels in Guangdong Province is serious. In the past two years, the situation of the first People's Congress meetings convened in one hundred and eleven cities and counties throughout the province is as follows: Last year, in addition to the five cities and counties of Guangzhou, Chaozhou, Zhanjiang, Xinhui, and Xinxing, which held two meetings on schedule in accordance with the law, ninety-four cities and counties held only one meeting, while twelve counties, including Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, Hua County, and Lianjiang, did not hold even one meeting; this year, only Nanxiong and Lianjiang counties held two meetings, thirty-four cities and counties held one meeting, and seventy-five cities and counties did not hold a single meeting.

According to the investigation by the Provincial People's Procuratorate, some cities and counties in Guangdong Province were careless and perfunctory in holding the first People's Congress meetings and People's Committee meetings, and even some violations of the law occurred. For example, when the People's Congress meetings elected members of the People's Committee, they did not follow the legal procedure of having representatives nominate candidates; the County People's Committee also arbitrarily revoked the qualifications of individual representatives of the County People's Congress.

In its request to the Provincial People's Committee, the Guangdong Provincial People's Procuratorate pointed out: The reason for the above situation is mainly that the leading personnel of some city and county People's Committees have a weak legal concept, lack understanding of the democratic centralism principle of the national political system, and lack sufficient understanding of the role of the People's Congress as the state power organ and the serious significance of the People's Committee implementing the principle of collective leadership. The request also pointed out that this situation will inevitably inhibit the enthusiasm of the people to participate in state management, so that the people's democratic system is not constantly strengthened but is becoming increasingly lax and weakened, leading to harmful consequences.

    广东省人民委员会采取三项措施
　　保证按期召开县市人民代表大会会议
    新华社广州4日电　广东省人民委员会根据省人民检察院的提请，最近正在着手纠正各县、市不按期召开人民代表大会会议和人民委员会会议的不良现象。
    广东省人民委员会决定采取三项措施来加强指导和督促各市、县人民委员会执行人民代表大会会议制度和人民委员会会议制度。这三项措施的第一项是：各市、县人民委员会应该在最近一次举行的人民委员会会议上对本市、县第一届人民代表大会和人民委员会的会议情况，进行一次全面的检查，并且作出相应的决议。检查的结果和市、县人民委员会所作出的决议内容，应该列为市、县人民委员会工作报告的一部分，向最近举行的市、县人民代表大会会议交代，并且上报省人民委员会。
    第二项措施是：为了保证人民代表大会会议的按时召开和依法进行会议工作，各市、县必须把中心工作列入人民代表大会会议议程，各级国家机关和工作部门应该为执行人民代表大会的决议而工作。同时要求市、县人民委员会领导人员对干部加强法制教育，使干部树立法制观念，保证宪法的执行。
    省人民委员会的第三项措施规定：建立有关市、县人民代表大会和人民委员会会议工作的请示报告制度。今后各市、县人民委员会要在人民代表大会举行会议后的十五天、人民委员会会议后的七天内，把会议的简要情况和决议报告省人民委员会。
    省人民委员会还决定在需要的时候，将派出工作人员到各地督促、检查这些措施的执行情况。
    新华社广州4日电　广东省各市、县不按期召开人民代表大会会议和人民委员会会议的现象很严重，广东省人民检察院最近根据在全省一百一十一个市、县检查的情况，提请省人民委员会纠正这种违反“中华人民共和国地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法”的不良现象。
    根据广东省人民检察院的调查，广东省违反地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法的现象是严重的。两年来，全省一百一十一个市、县的第一届人民代表大会会议召开的情况是：去年一年除了广州、潮州、湛江、新会、新兴五个市、县依法按期举行了两次会议以外，有九十四个市、县只举行过一次会议，而台山、开平、恩平、化县、廉江等十二个县一次也没有举行；今年只有南雄、廉江二县举行了两次会议，有三十四个市、县举行过一次，而有七十五个市、县一次会议也没有举行。
    据省人民检察院调查，广东省有的市、县在举行第一届人民代表大会会议和人民委员会会议时，还有草率从事，流于形式的现象，甚至还发生过一些违反法律的事情。例如：在人民代表大会会议选举人民委员会委员的时候，不是依照法律规定由代表提出候选人的办法来进行；县人民委员会会议还擅自撤销了个别县人民代表大会代表的资格。
    广东省人民检察院在给省人民委员会的提请书中指出：造成以上情况的原因，主要是某些市、县人民委员会的领导人员法制观念薄弱，对国家政治制度的民主集中制原则缺乏理解，对人民代表大会作为国家权力机关的作用和人民委员会贯彻集体领导原则的严肃意义认识不足。提请书还指出，这种情况必然阻抑人民群众参加国家管理的积极性的发挥，使人民民主制度不是不断加强而是日趋松懈削弱，导致有害的后果。
