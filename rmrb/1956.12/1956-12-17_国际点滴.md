    International Tidbits

    "Blood Bank"
    According to South Korea's "Dong-A Ilbo," the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique have opened a "blood bank" in Seoul to buy the blood of the South Korean people. They also hired a group of people to shout near the "blood bank": "Sell! Hot blood!" to lure poor people who have no way to make a living to sell their blood. According to "Kyunghyang Shinmun," students account for 50% of blood sellers in Gyeongsangnam-do, and workers and the unemployed account for 40.8%. Shin Dong-gyun, a student at a higher industrial school in Yeongdeungpo, died from excessive blood selling.

    Bragging Club
    In the Latin Quarter of Paris, France, there is a club dedicated to "bragging." This is a peculiar but very boring entertainment organization. Anyone who wants to join this organization must be able to answer a large number of inexplicable questions fluently. Its charter stipulates that each member must know how to brag and how to avoid contradictions in what they brag about. Moreover, each member must pay an annual fee of one hundred francs. If a member is found to be telling the truth instead of lying, the member will be fined five francs. In capitalist countries, "bragging" has also become entertainment, a business, and a way to make money!

    Racist Swimming Club
    A swimming meet held in Ipoh, Malaysia, by the British explicitly stipulates that Asians are not allowed to participate, not even to visit. Ipoh City Councilor Sinnathamby Srinivasan criticized the swimming meet's regulations as shameful. He demanded that the municipal authorities cancel the regulations.

    国际点滴
    “血液银行”
    据南朝鲜的“东亚日报”报道：美国和李承晚集团在汉城开设了一个“血液银行”，收买南朝鲜人民的鲜血。他们还雇用了一批人在“血液银行”附近喊叫：“卖呀！滚热的血！”以诱惑贫苦的无以为生的人去卖血。据“京乡新闻”说，在庆尚南道的卖血者中，学生占50％，工人和失业者占40.8％。住在永登浦的一名高等工业学校学生申东均，因卖血过多而死亡了。
    吹牛俱乐部
    法国巴黎的拉丁区，有一个专门“吹牛”的俱乐部。这是一个奇特的然而十分无聊的娱乐组织。谁要加入这个组织，必须能够对答如流地应付一大堆莫名其妙的问题。它的会章规定，每个会员必须知道怎样吹牛，怎样才能不使自己所吹的东西发生矛盾。而且，每个会员每年须缴一百法郎的会费。如果发现有会员说实话而不说谎话，那就要处罚这个会员五个法郎。在资本主义国家里，“吹牛”也成了娱乐，成了买卖，成了生财之道！
    种族主义者的游泳会
    英国在马来亚的怡保市举办了一个游泳会，这个会竟明文规定不许亚洲人参加，甚至连到里面去参观也不许。怡保市的议员西尼瓦沙指责说，这个游泳会的规定是可耻的。他要求市政当局取消这个规定。
