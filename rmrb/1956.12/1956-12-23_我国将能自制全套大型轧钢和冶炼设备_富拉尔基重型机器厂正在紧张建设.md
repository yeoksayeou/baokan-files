Xinhua News Agency, Qiqihar, December 22nd: China's first modern heavy machinery plant for manufacturing complete sets of large-scale smelting and steel rolling equipment is under construction in Fularji, a new industrial area of Qiqihar. Currently, several auxiliary and production workshops of the plant are hoisting beams and columns despite the severe cold, and the main workshop's foundation piling is also underway.

The heavy machinery plant's warehouses, welfare facilities, and temporary projects for construction needs, such as power lines, roads, and a joint processing plant, have already been completed. Employee dormitories covering over 200,000 square meters have been built.

Once completed, this heavy machinery plant will be able to manufacture the most advanced large-scale blooming mills, rail and bridge rolling mills, seamless steel pipe rolling mills, steel plate rolling mills, 500-ton open-hearth furnaces, and 1,500-cubic-meter blast furnaces, which China was previously unable to produce. Some of the equipment will be even more advanced than the newly built equipment at Anshan Iron and Steel in recent years. Many medium and thick steel plates and large seamless steel pipes that China cannot produce can be manufactured using this equipment. This plant will also supply various large-scale forged shafts and other large castings and forgings needed by China's motor factories, turbine factories, and large machinery factories.

This plant is being built with Soviet assistance. It concentrates over thirty years of technical achievements of the Soviet heavy machinery industry. The huge metalworking workshop will be equipped with remote control devices that automatically record processing information. Many mobile machine tools will also be installed here, capable of processing around large components weighing over a hundred tons. In casting, highly efficient machine molding, quick-drying casting methods, and enclosed casting cleaning methods will be adopted, eliminating airborne dust in the casting workshop. Transportation within the plant is connected by a crisscrossing network of railways and electric flatcars. Many parts of the complete set of new equipment, weighing tens of thousands of tons, can be smoothly transported to every corner of the plant area for processing.

    我国将能自制全套大型轧钢和冶炼设备
    富拉尔基重型机器厂正在紧张建设
    新华社齐齐哈尔22日电　我国第一座制造全套大型冶炼、轧钢设备的现代化重型机器厂，已经在齐齐哈尔市新兴工业区富拉尔基兴建。现在，这个工厂的几个辅助厂房和生产厂房正在严寒的气候下吊装梁柱，主厂房工程也开始试打基础大桩。
    这个重型机器厂的仓库、福利设施和施工需要的电线、道路、联合加工厂等暂设工程都早已建设好了。职工宿舍建筑了二十多万平方公尺。
    这个重型机器厂建成以后，将能制造我国过去不能制造的最新式大型的初轧机、钢轨桥梁轧机、无缝钢管轧机、钢板轧机、五百吨容量的大平炉和一千五百立方公尺容量的大高炉，有些设备比鞍钢近几年来新建的设备还要先进。我国不能生产的许多中厚钢板、粗大的无缝钢管都可以用这些设备来制造。这个厂还将供给我国电机厂、汽轮机厂、大型机器厂需要的各种大型锻轴和其他大型铸锻件。
    这个工厂是苏联帮助建设的。它集中了苏联重型机器工业三十多年的技术成就。在巨大的金工车间里，将安装能自动纪录加工情况的远距离控制设备。这里，还将要安装许多移动式的机床，可以环绕着上百吨的大部件加工。在铸造方面将采用效率很高的机器造型快干铸造法和密闭式的铸件清理余砂方法，铸造车间将看不到飞扬的砂尘。厂内的运输是由纵横交错的铁路线和电动平车连接起来的。成万吨重的全套新设备的许多部件，可以顺利地分别运到厂区的每个角落去加工。
