　　Visiting the Highland City - Kangding

　　Highland Ancient City
　　As we climbed over the cloud-shrouded Erlang Mountain peaks, looking down at the towering mountains beneath our feet, and feeling invigorated by the magnificent scenery of the Western Sichuan plateau, we never imagined that our destination, Kangding, was actually on the same contour line as this peak, which rises more than two thousand five hundred meters above sea level. After our jeep crossed the Luding Bridge over the Dadu River, we drove along the riverbank towards Kangding, climbing almost twenty meters for every kilometer we advanced.
　　While still in Ya'an, local comrades introduced us to the saying "Kang wind, Ya rain." It is said that Ya'an is famous for its rain, while Kangding has strong winds every afternoon. This turned out to be true. When we arrived in Ya'an, angry clouds were rising from Mount Zhougong, and rain began to patter down in the evening. When we entered the Dafeng Gully northeast of Kangding, we were greeted by the powerful west wind carrying fine sand.
　　We arrived at this famous ancient city on the plateau. The rushing Zheduo River roared through the city. Rows of buildings, white walls, and golden-roofed lama temples lined up along the hillside, creating the unique scenery of this mountain city.
　　Standing on the central street of the city and looking around, several large mountains tightly surrounded Kangding. Almost everyone who comes to Kangding for the first time anxiously asks, "Where is Paoma Mountain?" "Where is Guoda Mountain? Where is Dajianlu?" The young men and women of the Central Delegation's song and dance troupe, just after getting off the bus, began to sing the famous Tibetan folk song "On Paoma Mountain." Paoma Mountain is located on the east side of Kangding. The top of this steep mountain has a relatively flat lawn. During the Qing Dynasty, horse races were held here every year. Now, this lawn has become a place for young people and Young Pioneers in Kangding to go on outings. Legend has it that Zhuge Liang once sent General Guo Da to build arrows under a mountain in the north of the city, so Kangding also has the name "Dajianlu."
　　According to reliable documents, a city was built here as early as before the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. After the Three Kingdoms period, this mountain city became a transportation hub between Sichuan and Tibet, Qinghai and Tibet, and a center for economic and cultural exchange between the Han and Tibetan peoples. Currently, half of the city's residents are Tibetan, and the other half are Hui, Han, and Yi.

　　Changes in Life
　　We strolled along the cobblestone streets, admiring the unique scenery of this city. The novel goods in the shops along the street attracted those of us who were visiting the Tibetan area for the first time. Here were displayed small silver-inlaid filigree waist knives, satin high-top boots embroidered with gold trim, cylindrical embroidered Tibetan hats, delicate necklaces and headdresses, rosaries for lamas, large packages of tea bricks piled up like walls, as well as butter tea shops and restaurants labeled "Northern Flavor." The doors of clothing stores displayed various long and short leather jackets and beautiful Tibetan women's robes. The spacious storefronts of the National Trade Company and department stores were filled with various fabrics and general merchandise transported from Shanghai and Tianjin.
　　The central streets of the city were bustling with people. A group of Tibetan youths wearing wide sheepskin robes and exposing their right arms brushed past us. These were young farmers from the suburbs. They gestured and commented as they entered the shops to choose long boots and winter hats. A silver bell-like laughter came from behind us. Several girls wearing black-edged robes were lingering in front of a jewelry store, selecting silver ornaments. Old people, Young Pioneers, and lamas wearing purple robes passed by on the street. The sound of horses' hooves echoed through the streets. Merchants and herdsmen from remote villages also rode horses over snowy mountains to the city to purchase goods.
　　The streets of Kangding are noisy and touching. Everyone who comes here will immediately feel a new force impacting this ancient city, bringing it vigorous vitality. Whether it is from the cheerful faces of the students of the National Cadre School, from the Xinhua Bookstore, from the songs of the workers who are building new buildings, or from the movie posters and slogans on the street, you can feel the people's urgent desire to move towards a new life.
　　With only a slight understanding of Kangding's past, one can discover how great the changes have been in this mountain city in just a few years. Farmer Raoqindengtu told us: "Don't talk about too far back, even just two years before liberation, you could see people freezing and starving to death in this city every day. The streets were full of vagrants. People lived a half-starved life, and couldn't even afford butter tea." In those tragic years, the Tibetan people sang of their suffering: "A five-foot pole can't measure my suffering, a weighing pan can't measure my suffering; walking and crying, walking and crying, suffering for a lifetime, when will it end!" The changes in the family life of female porter Zejia are an epitome of the changes in the lives of the people of Kangding. When Zejia was sixteen years old, she shouldered the heavy burden of supporting her family, and she had to use her labor to support her old and sick father and young younger brother. She had no fixed occupation, and made a little money by doing odd jobs, but often could not find work. She said: "In those years, I don't remember eating a full meal for a few days. I was hungry all year round, even digging up wild vegetable roots to fill my stomach, and I was still in debt for grain."... When I talked to Zejia, she had just carried tea packages back, and there were still traces of sweat on her face. She said: "After liberation, I participated in the porter work. In the past few years, the debt has been paid off, and life is getting better day by day. I eat zanba, drink butter tea, and I also sent my younger brother to school."

　　Being Masters of Our Own House
　　During these days in Kangding, whether in contact with ordinary Tibetan residents, lamas, upper-class people, or Tibetan cadres, I heard the phrase "being masters of our own house" more than once. When they spoke of these words, serious and proud expressions appeared on their faces.
　　As long as one looks back at history, one will understand how precious and proud the Tibetan people are of this solemn right they obtained after the founding of New China.
　　From the Kublai Khan Mongol army to the Kuomintang government, the Tibetan people had long been under the plunder, exploitation, and massacre of reactionary rule. In those years, the Tibetan people never ceased their heroic struggle to defend their right to survival and resist the oppression of reactionary rule. On the snowy peaks of the Kangzang Plateau, the blood of the heroic sons and daughters of the Tibetan people was shed. As early as during the Long March of the Red Army, the Tibetan people, with the help of the Communist Party, established their own Boba government.
　　But the real liberation of the Tibetan people was after the founding of New China. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people here established their own autonomous organs, and the Tibetan people realized their long-cherished wish. With love and respect, they called the Han cadres who came here to help them carry out various construction projects "new Han people."
　　Yes, one should see how the Tibetan people are being masters of their own house. It was with this feeling that I walked into the Kangding County Mayor's office.
　　I walked into a bright room on the second floor, and a person of about twenty-six or seven years old extended his hand to me and said, "I am Yang Wubin." He also introduced a slightly shorter and slightly chubby young man to me, this is Li Hongming, deputy secretary of the Kangding County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. The day I visited them was Sunday, but the telephone still disturbed us from time to time.
　　The sun shone in from the window, and sparks flew from the charcoal brazier from time to time. We talked about the past, present and future of the Tibetan people, about democratic reform and current work. A touching picture of the Tibetan people fighting for a new life unfolded before me, it was so inspiring.
　　Kangding County began to implement democratic reforms in January this year, and this work has basically ended. The feudal exploitation system that had long been pressing on the heads of the Tibetan people, making them poor and backward, has been abolished. At present, there are already forty-three agricultural cooperatives and more than one hundred and twenty mutual aid groups in the county. Yang Wubin said: "At present, our main task is to lead the people to develop production and improve their lives."
　　I was surprised by their familiarity with the local situation and the people's lives. They casually cited the names of some farmers, described their past and present, and calculated the income and expenditure of their families, as clearly as familiar neighbors. Only those who are flesh and blood connected with the people can do this.
　　When I asked them to talk about themselves, Yang Wubin and Li Hongming both laughed.
　　"Our experiences are the same. It's enough to talk about one person."
　　They both came from poor Tibetan peasant families. Before liberation, they were classmates at the Frontier Normal School run by the Kuomintang government. This kind of schooling was then called "learning errands," which was apportioned by the Kuomintang government to various counties, and the children of poor Tibetans were hired to go to school. As soon as the Kangding area was liberated, they both participated in the work. The first government cadres and the People's Liberation Army they came into contact with left a deep impression on them, and the Party's ethnic policy inspired them. They firmly believed that only the Communist Party was truly the savior of the Tibetan people. From then on, these two young Tibetan farmers were determined to dedicate their lives to the cause of liberation of their nation. Later, they joined the Communist Party, and they served as secretary and deputy secretary of the district committee in the same district. Their Muya District is known as the best district in the county in terms of production and various tasks. In August this year, they were both transferred to the county to serve as the county's leading work. Li Hongming said modestly: "We don't have much work experience, and our cultural level is not high. We encounter many difficulties in our work. But the Party's ethnic policy and the Party's meticulous care for the Tibetan people have inspired us. Our determination is to study hard and do our work well."
　　While we were talking, a person wearing a sheepskin purple robe and a leather hat walked into the room. His weathered face, kind eyes and rough hands made me firmly believe that he was a farmer who had worked hard all his life.
　　Yang Wubin and Li Hongming immediately stood up to give him a seat. And introduced to me: "This is Dengzhu Jiangze, the old district chief of Muya District. He is forty-four years old this year."
　　Dengzhu Jiangze had crossed the Zheduo Mountain to the county for a meeting. After he sat down, he joined our conversation. He only knew a few simple Chinese words, so he had to ask Yang Wubin to translate for him. When we talked about the growth of ethnic minority cadres, Dengzhu Jiangze laughed: "You are welcome to visit our district. In our district, the main cadres in charge are Tibetans. The Han comrades have taught us how to serve the people."
　　I took another opportunity to visit Tuden Queyin, the president of the Intermediate People's Court of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. I met Tuden Queyin at a symposium held by the Central Delegation. At that time, a fat lama wearing a yellow robe stood up to speak. Someone introduced me: This is Tuden Queyin, the president of the Intermediate People's Court and the Khenpo of Namo Temple.
　　When I walked into the office on the second floor of the Intermediate People's Court this time, we were already old friends. Tuden let me sit on the short stool near the brazier. On the short table next to it, there were various Tibetan and Chinese case files and books. Tuden handles various cases accepted by the court here.
　　Our conversation started with the cases accepted by the court. President Tuden told me that two years ago, most of the cases accepted here were property disputes and vendettas. For hundreds of years, the custom of feuding has been popular in the Tibetan area. Two headmen would launch wars to compete for pastures, territories or to save face. Such feuds often lasted for decades, passing down through several generations, involving the people in many areas and causing loss of life and property. Tuden said: "Vendettas are one of the major disasters pressing on the heads of the Tibetan people. I don't know how many people have died and how much property has been destroyed. The reactionary governments in the past did not want to solve this matter, but instead instigated the Tibetan people to fight each other. Only the Communist Party sincerely relieves the suffering of the Tibetan people. The Party and the government's policy on such cases is: settle old cases and mediate new cases. This is really a good policy, I don't know how many lives have been saved, how much property has been saved. In the past two years, such cases have decreased."
　　Tuden took out a thick stack of files for me to read, and then pointed to the mediation documents one by one, telling me about the history and results of each case. I saw that many mediation documents were signed with "Mediator Tuden Queyin." When he talked about the situation when those enemies figured it out, reconciled, and even hugged each other, shedding tears of remorse and swearing to the heavens, he couldn't help laughing happily. Tuden Queyin excitedly said what was in his heart: "In the past few years, I have deeply realized in my work: The Communist Party and the government are sincerely helping the Tibetan people. Chairman Mao told us Tibetan people to be masters of our own house, and we must truly live up to the trust of the Party and the government. My confidence is very strong and very big. Our Tibetan people will definitely work hard to make progress and go to socialist society with the brotherly ethnic groups." Wang Xin, the deputy president sitting next to him, interjected: "President Tuden is serious and responsible in his work. He is familiar with the local people's customs and thoughts and feelings. Therefore, the handling of many cases is in line with the local situation and is approved by the people, so we have also learned a lot."
　　"There, there," Tuden modestly argued: "Isn't it still thanks to the guidance and help of the old cadres!"
　　In Kangding, I spent unforgettable ten days. Kangding left such a deep impression on me. I saw that an ancient nation of our great motherland with a glorious history is standing up from the snowy mountains and marching towards the new society of the future. Although this step is slow and steady, it is full of confidence and strength.

　　访高原城——康定
　　新华社记者　李耐因
    高原古城
    当我们翻上云雾弥漫的二郎山峰岭，俯瞰脚下群峰纵立，为西康高原壮丽雄伟的景色而振奋的时候，一点也没有想到我们的目的地——康定，竟然和这座拔海两千五百多公尺的高峰在一条等高线上。我们乘坐的吉普车跨过大渡河上的泸定桥以后，沿着河岸向康定行驶，几乎每前进一公里就要爬升二十多公尺。
    还在雅安的时候，当地同志就向我们介绍了“康风雅雨”的谚语。据说雅安以多雨闻名，而康定每天下午都刮大风。果然是这样。当我们到达雅安的时候，周公山上正涌起团团怒云，傍晚就淅淅沥沥落起雨来。我们进入康定东北大风沟的时候，迎接我们的是卷着细砂的雄劲的西风。
    我们到达了这座高原上的著名的古城。湍急的折多河喧闹着穿城而过。比连的阁楼、白色的墙壁、金顶的喇嘛寺，顺着山坡层层并列，构成这座山城的特有景色。
    站在城中心的街道上向四面望去，几座大山把康定紧紧包围住。几乎每一个初到康定的人，一到这里就着急地问：“跑马山在哪里？”“哪里是郭达山？打箭炉在哪里？”中央慰问团歌舞团的男女青年们，刚刚下车就欢唱起著名的藏族民歌“跑马溜溜的山上”来。跑马山就座落在康定的东面。这座陡削的大山的顶上，却有一片比较平坦的草坪。清朝时候，这里每年举行马赛。现在这片草坪已经成了康定城青年和少先队员们野游的地方。相传诸葛亮曾经派将军郭达在城北一座山下造箭，所以康定又有“打箭炉”的名称。
    根据可靠的文献，远在汉武帝以前这里就已经建城。三国以后，这座山城成了川藏、青藏的交通孔道，成了汉族和藏族经济文化交流的中心。现在全城居民中，一半是藏族，另外一半是回族、汉族和彝族。
    生活的变迁
    我们在碎石街道上漫步，赏览着这座城市的特有景色。街旁店铺的新奇货物吸引着我们这些初到藏区的人们。这里陈列着银镶缕花的小腰刀，绣着金边的缎呢高筒靴，圆筒形的绣花藏帽，纤巧的项圈和头饰，专供喇嘛们用的念珠，排得像墙一样的大包的茶砖；还有酥油店和标写着“北方风味”的食堂。服装店的门口陈列着各式长短皮衣和漂亮的藏族女袍。民族贸易公司和百货公司的宽大的门市部里，摆满了由上海、天津运来的各色衣料和百货。
    在城中心的街道上，流动着熙熙攘攘的人群。一群穿着羊皮宽袍、袒露着右臂的藏族青年同我们擦肩而过。这是从郊区来的青年农民。他们指手划脚地评论着，走进店铺去挑选长靴和冬帽。银铃一样的笑声从我们后边传来。几个穿着黑色镶边长袍的姑娘，正停留在一家首饰店门前选购银饰。街上走过了老年人、少先队员和披着紫色袈裟的喇嘛们。一阵马蹄哒哒声传过街头。遥远乡村的行商和牧民，也骑马翻过雪山大岭进城来采购商品。
    康定的街头是喧闹的，动人的。每一个到这里的人，会立刻感受到一股新生的力量在冲激着这座古城，给它带来蓬蓬勃勃的朝气。不论是从民族干部学校学员们欢快的脸上，从新华书店门市部，从正在修建楼房的工人的歌声中，还是从街头的电影海报、标语，都可以使你感受到这里的人民走向新生活的急迫的愿望。
    只要稍微了解一下康定的过去，人们就会发现这座山城在短短几年中发生了怎样大的变化。农民绕钦登土告诉我们：“不要讲太远，就是解放前两年，这座城里那一天不看到冻死和饿死的人。街上是成群结伙的流浪汉。人们过着半饥半饿的生活，甚至连酥油茶也吃不上。”在那些悲惨的年代里，藏族人民唱出自己的痛苦：“五尺杆没法量我的苦，秤盘没法量我的苦；哭着走路，哭着走路，一辈子苦死，哪时走到头！”女搬运工人泽呷家庭生活的变迁，就是一幅康定人民生活变化的缩影。泽呷十六岁的时候，就担负起全家生活的重担，她必须用自己的劳动来养活年老多病的父亲和幼小的弟弟。她没有固定的职业，靠打零工赚点钱，可是常常找不到活作。她说：那些年我没记得吃过几天饱饭，一年到头的挨饿，野菜根也采来充饥，还欠下了粮债。……我和泽呷谈话的时候，她刚刚搬运茶包回来，脸上还留有汗迹。她说：“解放后，我就参加了搬运工作。这几年，债还清了，日子一天比一天好了。吃的是?巴，喝的是酥油茶，我还送弟弟上了学。”
    当家作主
    在康定的这些日子里，不论是同普通的藏族居民、喇嘛、上层人士或是藏族干部接触，都不只一次地听到“当家作主”这句话。当他们说到这几个字眼的时候，他们的脸上就流露出严肃和骄傲的表情。
    只要翻一翻历史，人们就会理解到藏族人民对于他们在新中国成立后获得的这项庄严的权利是多么珍贵和自豪。
    从忽必烈蒙古军到国民党政府，藏族人民长期以来处在反动统治的掳掠、压榨和屠杀下面。在那些年代中，藏族人民从来不曾停止过捍卫自己生存的权利和反抗反动统治压迫的英勇斗争。在康藏高原白雪皑皑的峰岭上，洒遍了藏族人民英雄儿女的鲜血。远在红军长征的时候，藏族人民就曾经在共产党的帮助下，成立了自己的波巴政府。
    但是藏族人民真正的解放，却是在新中国成立以后。这里的人民在共产党的领导下成立了自己的自治机关，藏族人民才实现了多少年来的愿望。他们怀着爱戴和尊敬的心情，把来到这里帮助他们进行各项建设的汉族干部称为“新汉人”。
    是的，应该看一看藏族人民是怎样当家作主的。我就是怀着这样的心情走进康定县县长办公室的。
    我走进二层楼的一间明亮的房间，一个约模二十六七岁的人向我伸过手来说：“我是杨武斌。”他又把一位稍矮微胖的青年介绍给我，这是中共康定县委副书记李鸿鸣。我访问他们的那一天正是星期日，但是电话铃声仍然不时地打扰我们。
    阳光从窗外投射进来，木炭火盆不时地迸出一星火花。我们谈到藏族人民的过去、现在和将来，谈到了民主改革和当前工作。一幅藏族人民为新生活而斗争的动人图画，在我面前展开，它是那样使人振奋。
    康定县从今年1月份开始实行民主改革，这项工作已经基本结束。长久以来压在藏族人民头上，使藏族人民贫困落后的封建剥削制度已经被废除。目前全县已经有四十三个农业社和一百二十多个互助组。杨武斌说：“目前我们的主要工作，是领导人民发展生产，改善人民的生活。”
    他们对当地情况和人民生活的熟习，使我感到惊讶。他们随便地举出一些农民的名字，描述他的过去和现在，计算他家庭的收入和开支，像熟习的邻居那样清楚。只有那些与人民血肉相连的人，才可能这样。
    当我请求他们谈谈自己的时候，杨武斌和李鸿鸣都笑起来了。
      “我们的经历是一样的。说一个人就够了。”
    他们都出身于藏族贫困的农民家庭。解放前，他们曾一块在国民党政府办的边疆师范同学。这种上学当时被称为“学差”，是国民党政府向各县摊派的，贫苦藏民的子弟就受雇来上学。康定地区一解放，他们就都参加了工作。最初接触到的人民政府干部和解放军给他们留下深刻的印象，党的民族政策给他们鼓舞，他们深信只有共产党才真正是藏族人民的救星。从那时起，这两位青年藏族农民，就决心把他们的一生献给本民族的解放事业。后来，他们参加了共产党，他们在同一个区里，担任区委书记和副书记的工作。他们所在的木雅区，被称为全县生产和各项工作最好的区。今年8月，他们一起被调到县里来，担任县的领导工作。李鸿鸣谦逊地说：“我们的工作经验不多，文化水平也不高，工作中遇到不少困难。但是党的民族政策，党对藏族人民无微不至的关怀，鼓舞了我们。我们的决心是努力学习，努力把工作作好。”
    在我们谈话的时候，一位穿着羊皮紫袍，戴着皮帽的人走进屋来。他久经风霜的面容，淳厚善良的眼睛和粗糙的双手，使我深信这是一位勤劳了一生的农民。
    杨武斌和李鸿鸣立刻站起来给他让坐。并且介绍给我：“这是木雅区老区长邓珠降泽。今年已经四十四岁了。”
    邓珠降泽是翻过折多山到县里来开会的。他坐下以后，就加入了我们的谈话。他只会几句简单的汉话，只好请杨武斌替他翻译。当我们谈到民族干部的成长的时候，邓珠降泽笑起来：“欢迎你到我们区去看看。在我们区里主要负责干部都是藏人。汉族同志已经教会我们怎样给人民办事了。”
    我抽了另外一个机会，去拜访了甘孜藏族自治州中级法院院长土登却隐。我和土登却隐认识是在中央慰问团举行的一次座谈会上。当时一位胖胖的、披着黄色袍褂的喇嘛站起来发言。别人给我介绍：这是中级法院院长、南无寺堪布土登却隐。
    当我这次走进中级法院二层楼的办公室的时候，我们已经是老朋友了。土登把我让在靠近火盆的矮凳上。旁边的矮长桌上，摆着各种藏文和汉文的案卷和书籍。土登就在这里处理法院受理的各种案件。
    我们的谈话是从法院受理的案件开始的。土登院长告诉我，两年前，这里受理的案件多半是财产纠纷和打冤家。几百年来，藏族地区就盛行械斗的风气。两个头人为了争夺牧场、领地或者争面子，就发动起战争。这样的械斗往往打几十年，传好几代，把许多地区的人民都牵连进去，造成人民生命财产的损失。土登说：“打冤家，是压在藏族人民头上的大灾难之一，不知死了多少人，毁坏了多少财产。过去的反动政府都不想解决这件事，反而挑拨藏族人民自己打仗。只有共产党真心解除藏族人民的痛苦。党和政府对这类案件的方针是：旧案两结，新案调解。这真是好政策，不知救出多少人命，救出多少财产。近两年来，这种案件已经少了。”
    土登把一叠厚厚的卷宗拿给我看，然后指着一件件的调解书，向我讲述每椿案件的历史和结果。我看到许多调解书上都签有“调解人士登却隐”。当他谈到那些冤家想通了，和好了，还抱到一起流泪懊悔，对天盟誓的情节的时候，就高兴得禁不住哈哈大笑起来。土登却隐激动地说出他心里的话：“这几年，我在工作中深深体会到：共产党和政府是真心实意地帮助藏族人民。毛主席叫我们藏族人民自己当家作主，我们就要真正对得起党和政府的信任。我的信心很强，很大，我们藏族人民一定努力进步，和兄弟民族一起走到社会主义社会。”坐在旁边的王心副院长插嘴说：“土登院长工作认真负责，他熟习当地人民的风俗习惯和思想感情，因此处理许多案件都符合当地情况，获得人民赞同，使我们也学到不少东西。”
    “那里，那里，”土登谦虚地辩解说：“还不是亏了老干部的指导，帮助！”
    在康定，我度过了难忘的十天。康定给我留下如此深刻的印象，我看到，我们伟大祖国的一个古老的、有着光荣历史的民族，正从雪山峻岭中站起来，向着未来的新社会迈步。虽然这一步是稳慢的，但是却充满了信心和力量。
