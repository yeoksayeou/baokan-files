    Design Personnel's Savings Achievements
    (Reported by our Shenyang correspondent) According to incomplete statistics from seven units including the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute, the Shenyang Branch of the Nonferrous Metallurgical Design Institute, the Shenyang Design Institute of the Ministry of Electrical Engineering, and the Northeast Design Institute of the Ministry of Construction, they saved a total of 20,056,600 yuan in investment, more than 1,000 tons of steel, and more than 7,400 tons of cement for the country from January to November this year.
    When the Shenyang Design Institute of the Ministry of Electrical Engineering was designing the reconstruction and expansion project of a certain factory, the investment exceeded 60%. After utilizing existing old equipment and usable old factory buildings, they not only eliminated the excess investment but also saved more than 700,000 yuan. A large part of the huge investment savings made by various industrial design institutes this year came from utilizing old equipment and leveraging the role of existing factory buildings and equipment. To obtain materials locally, design units dispatched personnel to relevant local areas and departments before starting the design this year to investigate the output, origin, specifications, performance, and prices of local materials and all materials. Regarding the adoption of standard designs and the application of new technologies, the Shenyang Coal Mine Design Institute applied a new technology proposed by Wang Zizheng of the institute, "building shafts using permanent equipment." After successful testing, its trial use on the auxiliary shaft of a certain project alone saved 280,000 yuan and put the vertical shaft into production four months ahead of schedule.

    设计人员的节约成就
    本报沈阳电　据沈阳煤矿设计院、有色冶金沈阳设计分院、电机部沈阳设计院、建工部东北设计院等七个单位今年1至11月份的不完全统计，共为国家节省了投资二千零五十六万六千元，钢材一千多吨，水泥七千四百多吨。
    电机部沈阳设计院在设计某厂改建扩建工程的时候，超过60％的投资，经过利用原有旧设备和可以利用的旧厂房后，不仅把超过的投资全部压缩掉，而且节约了七十多万元。各工业设计院今年节约巨额投资中很大一部分是利用了旧设备，发挥旧有厂房和设备作用的结果。为了就地取材，今年各设计单位在着手设计之前都派出人力到各有关地方、部门进行调查地方材料和所有材料的产量、产地、规格、性能、价格等。在采用标准设计和运用新技术方面。沈阳煤矿设计院运用了该院王自正提出的一项“利用永久性设备建井”的新技术，经试验成功后，仅在某项工程的副井上试用，就节约了二十八万元，而且使竖井提前四个月投入生产。
