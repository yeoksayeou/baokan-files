Xinhua News Agency, Mangshi, 15th: Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe arrived in Mangshi, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, at 8 PM today by car via Wan-ting to attend the China-Myanmar Border People's Friendship Gathering.

Our country's Premier Zhou Enlai, who is currently on a friendly visit to Burma, also arrived here at the same time.

Accompanying Prime Minister U Ba Swe to Mangshi were also Burmese Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Shan State Affairs Sao Khun Kyi, Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, Burmese Minister of Finance Bo Khin Maung Gale, Burmese Kachin State Chief U Zanhta Sin, and senior officials of the Burmese government.

Arriving here with Premier Zhou Enlai were also Vice Premier He Long and accompanying staff.

Burmese Ambassador to China U Hla Maung and Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming also accompanied the two Premiers to arrive here.

This afternoon, many Chinese and Burmese national flags fluttered in the sky above Wanting Town in our country, located at the border between China and Myanmar. The horizontal banner of the red archway erected at the Wanting Bridgehead was written in both Chinese and Burmese: "Welcome Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Premier Zhou Enlai." When the two Prime Ministers slowly drove onto the Wanting Bridge from Myanmar and entered Wanting Town, more than 2,000 people from various ethnic groups in our border region, who were waiting in the streets of Wanting to welcome the two Prime Ministers, erupted into sustained, enthusiastic applause and cheers.

After the two Prime Ministers got out of the car at the bridgehead, they shook hands with Liu Minghui, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province who came to welcome them; General Xie Fuzhi, Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan; Xie Chongwen, Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Liu Chun, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the State Council; Dao Jingban, Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and others.

Next, the two Prime Ministers reviewed the guard of honor.

After the review, the two Prime Ministers accepted bouquets of roses presented by young women from various ethnic groups in our country.

Then, Liu Minghui, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province, delivered a welcome speech. He expressed a warm welcome to the two Prime Ministers and the Burmese guests. He said that thanks to the joint efforts of the leaders of our two countries, the friendly relations between China and Myanmar have achieved new development on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; the close, kinship-like ties between the border people of our two countries have also gained a further consolidated foundation. I am deeply convinced that the China-Myanmar Border People's Friendship Gathering held in Mangshi this time, with the personal participation of the two Prime Ministers, Deputy Prime Ministers, and distinguished guests, will greatly enhance the friendship between the border people of our two countries and the friendly relations between our two countries.

Prime Minister U Ba Swe then spoke. He said that the people of China and Myanmar have a traditional friendship of two thousand years in history, and both are peace-loving and war-opposing nations. Although the two countries have different political and economic systems, we have a common goal and adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by Chairman U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai. We advocate peaceful negotiation to resolve differences of opinion. Therefore, the current friendship between the two countries will definitely be closer than in history. He also said that in the friendly relations between the two countries, the most important are the border people of the two countries, because mutual understanding and friendship between neighboring people will surely guarantee the friendly relations between the two countries. Therefore, I am deeply convinced that the China-Myanmar Border People's Friendship Gathering to be held in Mangshi will be a success, and the friendship between the people of the two countries will be further consolidated. Prime Minister U Ba Swe's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause.

After the speeches, the two Prime Ministers stepped off the reviewing stand and walked smiling towards the welcoming crowd lining the streets. At this time, the welcoming crowd on both sides waved Chinese and Burmese national flags together, beat elephant-foot drums, and jumped up and down while holding flowers in their hands, shouting welcome slogans. A large group of young men and women from various ethnic groups dressed in colorful national costumes surged forward and presented bouquets of flowers to the leaders of the two countries. As the two Prime Ministers waved to the enthusiastic masses, the cheers of the people of all ethnic groups became even louder, and the sound of peace and friendship reverberated for a long time in the skies above the China-Myanmar border.

Amidst the cheers of the crowd, the two leaders boarded the car and headed for Mangshi.

At 8 PM, when the two Prime Ministers arrived in Mangshi, they were welcomed by thousands of people lining the streets.

Tonight, the two Prime Ministers had dinner together, and after the meal, they attended a performance held in their honor.

Xinhua News Agency, Mangshi, 15th: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long were warmly seen off by the local government and people along the way as they left Taunggyi for Mangshi today.

When Premier Zhou and his entourage left Taunggyi for Heho Airport, local officials and representatives of the masses went to the airport to see them off and present flowers.
