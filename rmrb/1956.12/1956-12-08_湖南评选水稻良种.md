Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 6th. Hunan Province has launched a mass campaign to select superior rice varieties. By the end of November, over 4,000 rice varieties had been collected throughout the province. Among these varieties, many valuable local superior strains have been discovered. The "Xihu Early" variety cultivated by farmer Tan Yunhe in Yuanjiang County and the "Huanghe Early" variety planted by some farmers in Huarong County not only yield tens to hundreds of extra jin of grain per mu compared to ordinary early rice in the area, but also mature seven to ten days earlier. This is of great significance for double-cropping rice areas to advance the maturity of early rice and strive for a bumper harvest in both seasons. The "Yehe Seed" late rice cultivated by farmer Zeng Zhaobin in Zhuanbukou Township, Liling County, over more than a decade is not only high-yielding but also suitable for planting in hilly areas. Liling County is preparing to promote this variety locally next year.

In the southern mountainous areas of the province, such as Jianghua Yao Autonomous County and Wugang County, some mid-season rice superior varieties have also been discovered. The common characteristic of these superior varieties is their high adaptability. They can grow well in any type of paddy field, with a maximum yield of 1,000 jin of grain per mu.

　　湖南评选水稻良种
    新华社长沙6日电　湖南省开展了群众性的评选水稻良种工作。到11月底，全省已征集水稻品种四千多种。在这些品种中，已经发现很多宝贵的地方良种。沅江县农民谭云和培育的“西湖早”和华容县有些农民种植的“黄鹤早”等早稻品种，不仅每亩较当地一般早稻能多收几十斤到一百斤谷，而且能提早成熟七天到十天，这对双季稻地区提早早稻成熟、争取两季丰收有着重大意义。醴陵县转步口乡农民曾昭斌经过十多年培育出来的“野禾种”晚稻，不仅产量高，而且适合丘陵地区种植。醴陵县已准备明年就地推广这种品种。
    在这个省的南部山区江华瑶族自治县和武冈等县还发现一些中稻良种，这些良种的共同特点是：适应性大。无论在哪种水田里都能长出好禾苗，最高每亩能收一千斤谷。
