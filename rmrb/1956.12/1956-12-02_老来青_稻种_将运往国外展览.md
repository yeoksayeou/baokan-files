"Laolaiqing" Rice Seeds
To Be Shipped Abroad for Exhibition

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The "Laolaiqing" rice seeds cultivated by Chen Yongkang, a national model of high rice yield, will soon be shipped to fifteen countries, including the Soviet Union, India, Burma, and Japan, for exhibition. Recently, the Lianmin Agricultural Cooperative in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, led by Chen Yongkang, accepted the commission from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade to sort out one hundred and twenty boxes of "Laolaiqing" late-season japonica rice seeds as specimens for the overseas exhibition.
      The "Laolaiqing" late-season japonica rice seeds have repeatedly been praised by the agricultural study delegation from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as agricultural experts from the Soviet Union, Romania, and other countries. This time, all the members of the Lianmin Agricultural Cooperative were very excited when they learned that "Laolaiqing" was going to be exhibited abroad. The cooperative's director, Chen Yongkang, personally went to the high-yield fields with the technicians and the masses to select fifteen mu of specimens with good color, long ears, and full grains. Each ear of these specimens has about eighty to one hundred grains, and some have more than one hundred and fifty grains. (Jiangsu Reporter Station)
