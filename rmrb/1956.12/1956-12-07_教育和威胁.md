　　Education and Threats
　　This year, some agricultural production cooperatives have experienced reduced production due to a lack of operational experience or the impact of natural disasters. In this situation, some cooperative members have begun to waver in their thinking, even proposing to withdraw from the cooperative and go it alone. What attitude should be adopted towards these members?
　　When cadres in Tongdong Township, Xinxing County, Guangdong Province, discovered that some members were agitating to withdraw from the cooperative, they convened a meeting and announced: "You can withdraw from the cooperative if you want, but in the future, if you harvest 1,000 jin of grain, you will have to sell 800 jin as surplus grain. What will you eat then!" Obviously, these members were frightened into not daring to ask to withdraw from the cooperative; as for their production enthusiasm, that is imaginable.
　　The management committee of the Sixth Agricultural Cooperative of Xin Dajiang Township, Taishan County, in the same province, adopted a patient and educational attitude towards members whose thinking had wavered due to the cooperative's reduced production. Through summarizing production, they correctly analyzed that the reason for the reduced production was the severe drought, and definitely not the fault of the cooperative system. What was the result? The members whose thinking had wavered no longer wavered, and production became even more active.
　　From these two examples, it is not difficult to see what the correct attitude to adopt is.

　　教育和威胁
    今年，有一部分农业生产合作社，因为缺乏办社经验或受到了自然灾害的侵袭，减产了。在这情况下，有些社员的思想动摇起来，甚至提出退社单干。对于这些社员，应当采取什么态度呢？
    广东新兴县同洞乡的干部，在发现有的社员闹退社后，就召集他们开会，并在会上宣布：“你们要退社也可以，但是，以后你们收一千斤谷子，就要你们卖八百斤余粮，看你们吃什么！”显然，这些社员是吓得不敢要求退社了；至于他们的生产情绪如何，那是可想而知的。
    同一个省的台山县新大江乡第六农业社的管理委员会，对于因社里减产而思想发生动摇的社员，采取了耐心教育的态度。他们通过总结生产，正确地分析了减产的原因是在于旱灾严重，绝不是合作社制度不好。结果怎样呢？思想动摇的社员不再动摇了，生产也更加积极了。
    从这两个事例不难看出：什么是应该采取的正确态度。
