Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: According to TASS, Politburo Member of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, Yugov, delivered a speech on December 7th at the open Party meeting of the Sofia Electrical Factory. More than 1,000 people attended the meeting.

In his speech, Yugov emphasized that after the Hungarian incident, Bulgarian Communist Party members became more consolidated and united around the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, and the heroic working class was also more closely united around the Party. All Communist Party members, peasants, and all honest patriots share the same thoughts, the same will, and the same desire: to guard against all activities of the enemy and all attempts by the enemy to infringe upon the people's democratic regime. Yugov said that the political enthusiasm, principledness, and high awareness displayed by Party members prove that our Party is a mature Leninist party, the fighting vanguard of the working class and the working people.

When talking about the Bulgarian Communist Party's policies, Yugov emphasized that the recent implementation of a number of important measures clearly demonstrates that the Party always cares about improving the material life of the working people. Yugov also said that our country's policy has been and will continue to be to continuously expand and strengthen friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The only reason why imperialists dare not infringe upon any of these countries is because of the existence of the Soviet Union, which possesses a strong economy and an invincible army.

Finally, Yugov talked about the tasks facing the Bulgarian people in the country's future socialist development. He also answered many questions raised by the factory workers.

    于哥夫在演说中着重指出，在匈牙利事件发生以后，保加利亚共产党员更加巩固、更加团结在保加利亚共产党中央委员会的周围，英勇的工人阶级也更加紧密地团结在党的周围。所有共产党员、农民、一切正直的爱国者都怀着同一的思想、同一的意志和愿望，即对敌人的一切活动和敌人侵犯人民民主政权的一切企图要防患未然。于哥夫说，党员表现的政治积极性、原则性和高度的觉悟证明，我们党是成熟的列宁主义的党，是工人阶级和劳动人民的战斗的先锋队。
    于哥夫在谈到保加利亚共产党的政策的时候着重指出，最近期间所实行的一些重要措施明显地证明，党始终关心改善劳动人民的物质生活。于哥夫还说，我们国家的政策过去是、将来仍然是不断扩大和加强同苏联和其他社会主义国家的友好和合作。帝国主义者之所以不敢侵犯我们这些国家中的任何一个国家，那只是因为拥有力量雄厚的经济和不可战胜的军队的苏联的存在。
