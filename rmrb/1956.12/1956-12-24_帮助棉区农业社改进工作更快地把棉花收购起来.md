According to statistics, from the time new cotton came on the market in September to December 10th, national purchasing departments have purchased a total of 15.8 million dan of ginned cotton. This figure accounts for only 62.6% of the annual planned purchase volume, a decrease of approximately 19% compared to the same period last year.

This year's cotton crop, except for certain provinces (Hebei, Jiangsu) that suffered varying degrees of yield reduction due to disasters, the total output nationwide is still higher than in 1955. But why is the progress of cotton purchasing slower than last year? Especially since this situation is occurring after the nationwide implementation of agricultural cooperation, it deserves close attention.

What are the reasons for the slow progress of cotton purchasing? One important reason is that many agricultural cooperatives are holding onto cotton and not selling it. What are the reasons why these agricultural cooperatives are not actively selling cotton to the state? One reason is that many agricultural cooperatives have not announced or earnestly implemented the reward system within the contracted work and output system in a timely manner. The output of each production team varies, and they all have concerns about the year-end settlement: the production teams with increased production are afraid of suffering losses, and the production teams with reduced production are afraid of compensation, so they are observing each other; thus, they conceal production and establish "small warehouses." In Feng Qixian's production team of Xiaoguozhai Cooperative in Qingshui District, Guan County, Shandong Province, 571 mu of cotton were planted, with a contracted output of 134.12 jin per mu, but the actual output was 150 jin. At the end of November, when they launched the cotton sales, they only reported an output of 135 jin, concealing an average of 15 jin per mu, and prepared to distribute the more than 8,500 jin of cotton they had concealed to the members of their team. In Jin Haozhuang District of Linqing County, a random inspection of 71 production teams in seven of the district's 13 agricultural cooperatives revealed that these production teams reported a total cotton inventory of 1.78 million jin, but the actual inventory was 2.61 million jin, concealing 830,000 jin. Similar situations exist in other regions as well. Another more common situation is that the statistical systems of most agricultural cooperatives are not sound. Cooperative cadres have no idea about the real numbers and are just afraid that if they report too much output, they will not be able to deliver it during the final settlement and distribution; so they underreport output and inventory. Some warehouse keepers are afraid of compensating for weighing errors and intentionally underreport inventory. Obviously, these situations are not only unfavorable to cotton unified purchase work but also, because of holding onto cotton and not selling it, will bring adverse effects on internal unity and year-end settlement and distribution.

From the above situation, in the cotton unified purchase work, it is necessary to specifically help agricultural cooperatives solve specific problems based on the different situations of the current agricultural cooperatives holding onto cotton and not selling it. At the same time, according to the complex situation of the current agricultural cooperatives holding onto cotton and not selling it, the purchase methods should be improved according to local conditions. For agricultural cooperatives that have cotton in storage but are not actively selling it, cotton purchasing departments should combine purchasing with the agricultural cooperative's year-end settlement and distribution work, and on the basis of eliminating the various ideological concerns of the members about settlement and distribution, further verify the cotton output of the production teams and thoroughly clear the cotton warehouses, urging them to sell the cotton to the state as soon as possible. For agricultural cooperatives with large stocks, special personnel should also be assigned to assist them in organizing labor and animal power to rush transportation, striving for these agricultural cooperatives to sell off their stocks before the new year. When agricultural cooperatives deliver and sell cotton, those that can be sent to processing plants should be sent to processing plants, and those that cannot be sent to processing plants can also be sent to nearby purchasing stations. Don't delay the progress of purchasing because of emphasizing economic accounting and mechanically implementing direct transportation. For agricultural cooperatives with small stocks, in order to save their labor force, purchasing departments should appropriately change the past method of sitting at stations for purchasing and organize a certain number of cadres to go to the countryside for mobile purchasing. In this way, it can also facilitate farmers to sell the part of their retained cotton that they do not need to the state. Since November, many areas in Shandong Province, based on the current characteristics of unbalanced cotton sales in agricultural cooperatives, have adopted a variety of purchasing methods, such as helping agricultural cooperatives to verify output and clear warehouses, and adopting on-site inspection, sending to the factory for weighing, and mobile purchasing, which has promoted the progress of the agricultural cooperatives' year-end settlement and distribution work and expanded the amount of cotton purchased. Recently, the Chengguan Purchasing Station in Gaotang implemented the purchasing method of "on-site inspection in cooperatives, sending to the factory for weighing" for four agricultural cooperatives, selling more than 55,600 jin of cotton in one week, an increase of more than 50% compared to the previous week's purchase volume. This shows that as long as purchasing departments study the situation, conduct detailed work, and think of more ways, the progress of cotton purchasing can be accelerated. Currently, there are still many purchasing personnel who do not go deep into agricultural cooperatives to investigate and understand, and help them solve the difficulties in selling cotton, but blindly believe that agricultural cooperatives do not have much cotton in storage or that "they will sell it to the state sooner or later," and do not actively carry out purchasing. This is actually a concrete manifestation of fearing difficulties in work.

This year's cotton maturation period is relatively late, and in addition, various places have advanced winter plowing and pulled out cotton stalks early, there are many unopened cotton bolls on the cotton stalks. It is estimated that in general, 5 to 6 jin of cotton can be peeled from unopened cotton bolls per mu of cotton field; in many cases, more than 10 jin can be picked; at the same time, there are a large number of "eyelashes" and uncleaned petals on the cotton stalks, and 1 to 2 jin can be picked per mu. This is a huge wealth for the state and a huge income for agricultural cooperatives. However, many agricultural cooperative cadres believe that harvesting these cotton flowers is a small matter and there is no "profit" in it, and they pile up the cotton stalks casually; some cooperatives, although they pay attention to harvesting, but because the work points are unreasonably stipulated, the members are unwilling to do it; or the peeling and picking are rough, resulting in a lot of waste. Close attention should also be paid to this situation. According to the existing experience in various places, there are two methods for handling peach cotton and residual "eyelashes": one is to stipulate reasonable work points for peeling peaches (or pay wages), and distribute the cotton stalks to the members; the peeled cotton is dried and picked clean, and sold to the state uniformly by the agricultural cooperative. The advantage of this method is that it is concentrated peeling and concentrated sales, which can be processed in a short time. Another method is to distribute the cotton stalks or cotton bolls to the members, without recording work points for peeling peaches, and let the members peel and sell themselves, with the income belonging to the members. The advantage of this method is that the procedures are simple, and it is easier to stimulate the enthusiasm of the members. Both of these methods can be promoted. But no matter which method is adopted, it must be for the purpose of salvaging state assets and increasing members' income, and the peeled cotton should be sold to the state, and it is not allowed to be sold on the free market.

    帮助棉区农业社改进工作更快地把棉花收购起来
    王越毅
    据统计，从9月份新棉上市以来到12月10日为止，国家采购部门共收皮棉一千五百八十万担，这个数字仅占年度计划收购数的62.6％；比去年同时期的收购数量下降了19％左右。
    今年种植的棉花除部分省份（河北、江苏）因遭受灾害有不同程度减产外，从全国的情况来看，总产量仍然比1955年高。但为什么棉花收购进度反而比去年慢了呢？特别是这一情况发生在全国农村已经实行了农业合作化以后，更值得密切注意。
    是什么原因使得棉花收购工作进展迟缓呢？一个重要的原因是不少农业社存棉不售。这些农业社不积极卖棉花给国家的原因何在？原因之一是许多农业社没有及早宣布和认真执行包工包产中的奖励制度，各生产队产量高低不一，都对年终决算有顾虑：增产的生产队怕吃亏，减产的生产队怕赔偿，相互观望；于是就隐报产量，建立“小仓库”。山东省冠县清水区小郭砦社冯其先生产队，植棉五百七十一亩，每亩包产一百三十四斤十二两，但实产一百五十斤。11月底发动售棉的时候，他们仅报产量一百三十五斤，平均每亩瞒产十五斤，并准备把隐瞒下来的八千五百多斤棉花分给本队的社员。临清县金郝庄区全区有十三个农业社，抽查其中七个社的七十一个生产队，结果发现这些生产队共报库存棉花一百七十八万斤，但是实存二百六十一万斤，瞒报了八十三万斤。像这样的情况在其他地区也有。另一种比较普遍存在的情况是大多数农业社的统计制度还不很健全，社干部心中无数，只怕把产量报多了到决算分配的时候交不出来；于是就少报产量和库存量。有些保管人员怕赔秤，也有意地少报库存。很显然，这些情况不仅对棉花统购工作不利，而且由于存棉不售，给社内团结和年终决算分配也将带来不良的影响。
    从以上情况看，在棉花统购工作中，必须根据当前农业社的存棉不售的不同情况，具体帮助农业社解决具体问题；同时，还要根据当前农业社存棉不售的复杂情况，因地制宜地改进收购方法。对有存棉而不积极出售的农业社，棉花收购部门应当结合农业社的年终决算分配工作进行收购，在解除社员群众对决算分配的各种思想顾虑的基础上，进一步核实生产队的棉花产量，并彻底清理棉花仓库，督促他们尽快地把棉花卖给国家。对存量较大的农业社，还应该指派专人协助他们组织劳力、畜力突击赶运，争取这些农业社在年前将存棉售清。在农业社交售棉花的时候，能送加工厂的就送到加工厂，不能送加工厂的也可以送到附近的采购站，不要因强调经济核算和机械地执行直运而延缓收购进度。对存量不多的农业社，为了节省他们的劳动力，采购部门应该适当地改变过去坐站收购的方法，组织一定数量的干部下乡流动收购。这样，还可便利农民把自己用不了需要出售的部分自留棉卖给国家。山东省不少地区自11月份以后，根据当前农业社售棉不平衡的特点，分别采取了帮助农业社查实产量清理仓库，并采取到社验级、送厂过秤、流动收购等多种多样的收购方式方法，结果推动了农业社年终决算分配工作的进展，扩大了棉花收购量。高唐城关采购站最近对四个农业社实行了“就社验级，送厂过秤”的收购方法，一星期送售棉花五万五千六百多斤，比上一星期的收购量提高了50％以上。这说明，采购部门只要研究情况，细致地进行工作，多想办法，棉花的收购进度是可能加快的。当前还有不少采购人员不深入农业社进行调查了解，帮助它们解决售棉中的困难，而盲目地认为农业社存棉不多或者认为“早晚要卖给国家”，而不积极进行收购。这其实是畏惧工作中的困难的具体表现。
    今年棉花成熟期较迟，再加上各地都提前冬耕，提早拔掉了棉秸，棉秸上的未开棉铃是很多的。据估计一般每亩棉田的未开棉铃可剥五到六斤棉花；多的可摘到十斤以上；同时棉秆上还有大量的“眼睫毛”和未摘干净的花瓣，每亩也可拣一到两斤。这是国家的一批巨大的财富，也是农业社的一项巨大收益。但是有不少农业社干部却认为收摘这些棉花是小事情，没有什么“油水”，把棉秸随便堆放起来；有的社虽然注意了收摘，但由于工分规定的不合理，社员都不愿意干；或者剥拣粗糙，造成很大浪费。对这种情况也应该密切注意。根据各地现有经验，处理剥桃棉和残余的“眼睫毛”有以下两种方法：一是规定出合理的剥桃工分（或支付工资），把棉秸分给社员；剥出的棉花经过晒干拣净，由农业社统一卖给国家。这个办法的好处是集中剥、集中卖，短时间就可处理完毕。另一个方法是把棉秸或棉铃分给社员，不记剥桃工分，由社员自剥自卖，收入归社员所有。这个办法的好处是手续简便，更容易刺激社员的积极性。这两个办法都是可以推行的。但不论采取哪种方法，都必须以挽救国家资财和增加社员收入为目的，而且应该把剥出的棉花卖给国家，不可允许在自由市场上出售。
