　　Visiting the Yugoslav Film Delegation
　　By our reporter Lin Gang
    On the afternoon of November 28th, in the reception room on the sixth floor of the Beijing Hotel, the comrades of the Yugoslav Film Delegation met with several reporters. We noted their enthusiastic and frank conversations.

    The head of the delegation, Samujlo Amadzai, is a shrewd and capable person. He has been involved in the film industry for decades and has held various leadership positions in the Yugoslav film industry. He spread his hands on his knees and said:

    "Having been in China for only a few days, regarding China, we can 'only say that we have a very pleasant feeling. As for observations, we'll have to leave them for the next meeting."

    Then let's talk about the film industry in Yugoslavia. In 1951, the Yugoslav film industry underwent a reform. Chinese audiences and film workers are very interested and hope to know the specific content of this reform.

      "In the past, Yugoslav film enterprises were led by the central government. After the reform in 1951, the authority of the central leading organization was abolished. The management of film enterprises was handed over to the workers' committees within the enterprises. The central leading organization has no direct leadership relationship with the enterprises. The workers' committee controls production. In the past, the central leading organization determined the annual production plan for films. After the reform, each film production company formulated its own production plan based on its own conditions, such as the size of the company, the amount of capital and equipment, and the number of staff. They are responsible for their own profits and losses. Film workers, including directors, actors, cinematographers, production managers, sound engineers, makeup artists, and other personnel, are no longer employed by the state. They become freelance artists with the freedom to sign contracts with this or that production company to shoot films. In short, that is what the 1951 reform was about,” said Amadzai.

      "This change requires our film enterprises to improve the organizational work in the film production process and improve the quality of the films; this change has also greatly stimulated the interest of film workers in film production. They can cooperate in filming according to their own strengths, talents and interests. Good film workers can make more films and reasonably get more remuneration; film workers who are not good get less remuneration. As for those who rarely have people asking them to make films, they have to find other jobs that are suitable for them.

      "Due to this reform, some of the personnel who used to hold leadership positions in the ministry have transferred to film enterprises. These people have artistic talent and rich experience. They have regained the opportunity to display their creative talents in films.

      "The benefits of the reform to our country's film industry can be explained by the following facts: Before the reform, there were about 1,200 people engaged in creative work in the Yugoslav film industry system, while now there are only about 350 people left; in the past, due to bureaucratic leadership, there were about 2,000 administrative and technical personnel in the film system, and since the enterprise was handed over to the workers' committee, it has been correspondingly reduced to about 700 people. The number of people has decreased, but the output of films has increased and the quality has improved. Work efficiency has also been greatly improved. In the past, it took one and a half years (average time) to produce a film, but now it only takes three and a half to five months. The production cost of each film has been reduced from about 60 million dinars (Yugoslav currency unit) to about 30 million dinars, a decrease of 50%."

    The humorous, somewhat gray-haired Georgi Skrigin (member of the delegation, director of the film "The Two of Them"), during our conversation, took on the extra task of translating Yugoslav into Russian. Now he answers the question "How do Yugoslav film workers improve the artistry and ideology of films?"

    He recounted to the reporters a historical situation: during the war years, the artists, under the leadership of the Party, participated in the struggle against the enemy as soldiers. Skrigin himself participated in the guerrilla art troupe in the war to liberate the motherland. He recorded many of the most meaningful events. The Yugoslav people's film industry was built by such a group of trained people. This is an important premise.

      "Naturally, the ideology and artistry of films have a great relationship with the artist's talent. Here, we must talk about reform again," said Skrigin. "Before 1951, our people were very dissatisfied with the low quality of films. What was the film production situation like at that time? The central leading organization stipulated everything properly: how many films to be made this year, how many of what kind of themes, even which one to film first and which one to film later, and what they should look like, were all fixed arrangements made by the leaders. This approach made those directors and actors without talent very satisfied. Like pharmacists filling prescriptions, they produced one formulaic, cookie-cutter film after another according to the regulations of the higher authorities. Regardless of whether the film was well-made or not, regardless of whether the film was popular with the audience, they always reliably received a fixed monthly salary. The reform of the film industry in 1951 affected the stable days of these people. No one or very few people signed contracts with them. Talented directors and actors breathed a sigh of relief. They got rid of the shackles that should not have been on artistic creation. Regarding the achievements after the reform, we can talk about the film festival held in Pola, our country, in July this year. The twelve films exhibited that time were made in one year. Five of them were warmly welcomed by the audience. Our country's films have also been well received internationally. 'The Adventures of a Little Warrior', which is being screened in China this time, won the first prize for children's films at the Venice Film Festival in 1952."

    One reporter asked any of the comrades present to talk about the different feelings in creation before and after the 1951 reform from their own personal experience.

      Vladimir Pogacic, the director of "Old Grudges and New Hatreds," answered this question. He said: "Before 1951, I made two films. The script was assigned to me. I was also specifically instructed on how to shoot. So I started working according to the 'regulations', not according to my own wishes. The results of these two films were not good. Now, as a director, I can choose good scripts that I think are suitable for me to film. Every filmmaker can freely develop their artistic creative talents. 'Old Grudges and New Hatreds' is a work that I am more satisfied with, and here you can see my own artistic style."

    The head of the delegation, Amadzai, interjected at this time: "Naturally, it cannot be understood that our films were all bad before the reform and all good after the reform. The reform allowed us to get rid of the methods of management and leadership of the film industry that we had copied from foreign countries in the past and embark on a new path that we created ourselves."

    When talking about how the Party leads film work, Pogacic said: "The Party committee does not designate which Party member to take on which position. Each Party member, according to his own ability, serves as a director, screenwriter, or other work. If a Party member serves as the director of a factory, he must be a person who is capable of leading the factory's production. Party members who often fail to complete work tasks are naturally eliminated in their work. The Party does not allow the production of films that are reactionary in political content. However, the Party does not stipulate that realism is the only creative method. In art, the Party does not interfere."

    The beautiful Yulia Starich had been quietly listening to the conversation through two translations. When she was asked by a reporter to introduce how she created the role of the nurse in "Decisive Moment," she began to be a little shy. She said softly that her inner feelings were very rich in terms of creation. She said that she was very sorry that she did not have the ability to speak and could not express it well. But she immediately readily agreed to the request of a reporter from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and sang several Slovenian folk songs for its listeners. The sound recorded with a wire recorder was immediately broadcast on the turntable. That low, emotional singing took us to her distant, beautiful country amidst the surging tides.

### 访南斯拉夫电影代表团

　　访南斯拉夫电影代表团
　　本报记者　林钢
    11月28日下午，在北京饭店六楼会客室里，南斯拉夫电影代表团的同志们同几个记者见了面。我们记下了他们的热情和坦率的谈话。
    团长萨穆伊洛·阿玛达伊，是一位精明干练的人。他从事电影事业已经有几十年，在南斯拉夫电影事业中担任过各种领导工作。他用两只手在膝前一摊说：
    “到中国短短几天，关于中国，“只能说我们有非常愉快的感觉。观感之类，只好留待下次见面再谈了。”
    那末就谈谈南斯拉夫的电影事业吧。在1951年，南斯拉夫的电影事业，进行了一次改革。中国的观众和电影工作者，怀着很大的兴趣，希望知道这次改革的具体内容。
      “南斯拉夫的电影企业，过去是由中央领导的，经过1951年的改革，中央领导机构的权限取消了。电影企业的管理权交给了企业内部的工人委员会。中央领导机构和企业没有直接的领导关系。工人委员会掌握生产。过去是由中央领导机构来确定影片的全年生产计划，改革以后，各电影制片公司根据自己的条件，如公司的大小、资金和设备的情况，工作人员的多少等等，自己来制定制片计划。他们自负盈亏的责任。电影工作者，包括导演、演员、摄影师、制片主任、录音师、化妆师等各种人员，不再受雇于国家，他们成为自由职业的艺术家，他们有自由权利去同这个或那个制片公司签订合同来拍摄影片。简单说来，1951年的改革就是这样。”阿玛达伊说。
      “这个变化使得我们的电影企业必须改进制片过程中的组织工作，提高影片的质量；这个变化也大大激发了电业工作者对影片生产的兴趣。他们可以按照自己的特长、才能和兴趣，合作拍摄影片。好的电影工作者可以更多的拍到片子，合理地得到更多的报酬；不好的电影工作者得到的报酬就少些。至于那些难得有人请他们拍片子的人，只好去找对于他们合适的其他职业了。
      “由于这次改革，过去在部里担任着领导工作的一部分人员，转到了电影企业里来。这些人是有艺术天才和丰富经验的。他们重新得到了机会把自己的创作才能在影片中发挥出来。
      “改革对于我国电影事业带来的好处，可以从下面几个事实得到说明：改革以前，南斯拉夫电影事业系统从事创作的人员，大约有一千二百人，而现在只剩下三百五十人左右；过去由于官僚主义的领导，电影系统的行政和技术人员约有二千人，自从把企业交给工人委员会以后，也已相应地减少为七百人左右。人数减少了，然而影片产量却比以前增加了，质量提高了。工作效率也大大提高。过去生产一部影片（平均时间）要一年半，现在只要三个半月到五个月。每部影片的生产成本，由大约六千万基那尔（南币单位）降低为三千万基那尔左右，即降低了50％。”
    诙谐的，头发有些花白的格奥尔吉·斯克里京（团员、影片“他俩”的导演），在我们谈话的时候，担任着把南斯拉夫语译成俄语的额外任务。现在他回答“南斯拉夫电影工作者怎样提高影片的艺术性和思想性”这个问题。
    他向记者们追述了这样一个历史情况：在战争的年月里，艺术家们在党的领导下，作为战士，参加了当时的对敌斗争。斯克里京自己就是在解放祖国的战争中，参加了游击队文工团的。他曾记录了许多最有意义的事件。南斯拉夫的人民电影事业就是由这样一批经过锻炼的人建立起来的。这是重要的前提。
      “自然，电影的思想性和艺术性同艺术家的才能有很大关系。这里又要谈到改革了。”斯克里京说：“1951年以前，我国人民对于影片质量不高的情况，表示很不满意。那个时候的电影生产情况是怎样的呢？中央领导机构把一切都规定得妥妥当当的：今年要拍多少部影片，什么样的题材要多少，甚至那一部先拍，那一部后拍，拍成什么样子的，都由领导作了固定的安排。这种作法使得那些没有才能的导演和演员很感满意。像药剂师照着药方配药一样，他们根据上级的规定，一部又一部地生产那些公式化的，千篇一律的影片。无论拍得好与坏，无论影片是否受到观众欢迎，他们总是很靠得住的每月得到一定的工资。1951年电影事业的改革使得这些人的稳稳当当的日子受到了影响。没有人或很少有人去同他们签订合同了。有才能的导演和演员扬眉吐气了。他们摆脱了对于艺术创作不应当有的束缚。关于改革以后的成绩，可以谈到今年7月在我国波拉举行的电影节。那次展出的十二部影片是一年中拍摄成的。其中五部受到观众的热烈欢迎。我国的影片在国际上也受到了好评。这次在中国上映的‘小勇士历险记’，曾经在1952年的威尼斯电影节上获得了儿童片一等奖。”
    有一位记者请在座的任何一位同志，从自己的亲身体会来谈谈1951年改革前后，在创作方面的不同的感受。
      “旧恨新仇”的导演符拉迪米尔·泡加契奇回答了这个问题。他说：“1951年以前，我拍过二部影片。剧本是分派给我的。我还被具体地指示说，应当怎么怎么拍。于是我按照‘规定’，而不是按照自己的心意来开始工作。这两部影片的成绩是不好的。现在，作为一个导演，我可以选择好的、我认为对我合适的剧本来拍片了。每一个电影工作者可以自由发挥自己的艺术创造的才能。‘旧恨新仇’是我比较满意的作品，这里就可以看到我自己的艺术风格。”
    团长阿玛达伊这时插话说：“自然，不能这样理解，改革以前我们的影片都是不好的，改革以后都是好的。改革，使我们摆脱了过去从外国搬来的对于电影事业的管理和领导的方法，走上了自己开创的新的道路。”
    在谈到党怎样领导电影工作的时候，泡加契奇说：“党的委员会不指定那个党员来担负那个职位。每个党员，按照他自己的能力，担任导演、编剧或其他工作。如果党员担任厂长，他必需是一个有能力领导全厂生产的人。经常不能完成工作任务的党员，在工作中自然受到淘汰。党不允许制作在政治内容上反动的影片。但是党并不规定现实主义是唯一的创作方法。在艺术方面，党不干涉。”
    美丽的尤利亚·斯塔里奇一直安静地听着经过两道翻译的谈话。当她被一位记者要求介绍她是怎样创造“当机立断”中的女护士这个角色的时候，开始有些腼腆。她轻声地说，在创作方面，她的内心感觉很丰富。她说她很抱歉自己没有讲话的才能，不能很好地表达出来。但是她立即慨然答应了中央人民广播电台记者的请求，为它的听众唱了几支斯洛文尼亚的民歌。用钢丝录音机录的音马上在转盘里放送出来。那低沉的满含感情的歌声，把我们带到了她的遥远的、在潮声激荡中的美丽的国家。
