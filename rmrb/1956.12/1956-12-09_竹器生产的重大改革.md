　　A Major Reform in Bamboo Utensil Production

　　This newspaper reports: Xue Wuzhen, a member of the Yibin City Bamboo Utensil First Production Cooperative in Sichuan Province, has recently successfully created machines for splitting bamboo, making layers, and stripping bamboo strips. This is a major reform in bamboo utensil production.

　　These machines are very easy to operate. Workers only need to feed the bamboo into the machine's blades. If using one hand, the entire set of machines only requires twenty people to operate. In nine hours, it can produce 199,500 bamboo strips of one zhang one pi, equivalent to the work of 420 medium-skilled workers in one day. According to the cooperative's current production volume, it can save more than 75,750 yuan per year, excluding machine repair costs and electricity fees. (Liang Hongjin)

　  竹器生产的重大改革
    本报讯　四川省宜宾市竹器第一生产合作社社员薛五祯，最近创造成功了开竹、打层和剥篾机，这是竹器生产的一个重大改革。
    这种机器操作很简便，工人只要用手把竹子送到机器的刀口上就行。如果用单手，全部机器只需二十人操作，一天九小时可以生产一丈一匹的竹篾十九万九千五百匹，相当四百二十个中等技术的工人一天的工作量。按照该社目前的生产量计算，除去机器修理费、电费以外，每年可以节约七万五千七百五十多元。　（梁宏锦）
