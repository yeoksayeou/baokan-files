Xinhua News Agency report:

    The tugboat "Qiannei People" built in Shanghai for Guizhou has already departed from here on the 12th and will navigate on the Wujiang River in the future.

    The Wujiang River was the first natural barrier that the Red Army encountered after arriving in Guizhou during the Long March. Its banks are lined with steep cliffs and turbulent waters. Until now, no motorized vessels have ever navigated it.

    The "Qiannei People" tugboat has one hundred horsepower, and its draft is only 0.6 meters when fully loaded, making it suitable for navigation on the Wujiang River.

    乌江里第一只机动船
    据新华社讯　上海为贵州制造的一艘拖轮“黔内人民”号，已经在12日驶离这里，以后将在乌江上航行。
    乌江是当年红军长征到达贵州以后经过的第一道天险，两岸削壁陡坎，水流湍急，一直到现在，没有航行过机动的船只。
    “黔内人民”号拖轮有一百匹马力，满载时吃水只有零点六公尺，适宜于在乌江航行。
