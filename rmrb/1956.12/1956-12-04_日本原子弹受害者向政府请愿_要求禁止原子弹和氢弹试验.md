    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. Tokyo dispatch: Approximately two hundred representatives of atomic bomb victims from all over Japan petitioned the Japanese Diet and Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama on the 3rd, requesting efforts to realize a ban on atomic and hydrogen bomb testing.
    These representatives came to participate in the second national convention of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, held in Tokyo from December 3rd to 5th. They held the convention in the morning and unanimously passed four petition demands with the unanimous approval of all attendees. The four demands are: that the Japanese Diet, in its name, request countries possessing atomic and hydrogen bombs to conclude an agreement banning atomic and hydrogen bomb tests, and that the United Nations be requested to pass a resolution banning atomic and hydrogen bomb tests; that the Japanese Diet be required to pass a resolution to withdraw atomic and hydrogen bomb bases and prohibit the transport of nuclear weapons into Japan, and that the Japanese government immediately begin consultations with relevant parties to achieve this goal; to investigate the situation of atomic and hydrogen bomb victims and quickly formulate laws to aid them; and to establish a comprehensive research institute for radiation treatment in a timely manner to treat victims.
    The second national convention of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs will continue to meet for the next two days to discuss future movement directions and organizational issues.
