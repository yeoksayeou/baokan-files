    Prospects for Japanese-Soviet Trade
  　Wan Feng
    Following the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, the protocol on developing trade and granting each other most-favored-nation status came into effect. In the future, trade between the Soviet Union and Japan will develop on a new basis, which is particularly beneficial to Japanese industry, commerce, and the people's livelihood.
    The Soviet Union and Japan, due to their developed production, geographical proximity, and convenient transportation, had long-term trade relations in history. However, since the trade links between the two countries were interrupted by World War II, trade between the two countries has not been restored and developed. This is not in the interests of the people of both countries. The reason why Japanese-Soviet trade could not develop in the eleven years after the war was the obstruction and sabotage by American imperialism. After the United States occupied Japan, in order to ensure that American monopoly capital could plunder Japan, it did not hesitate to damage the Japanese national economy, prevented Japan from restoring trade with neighboring countries, and used the so-called "embargo" policy to hinder the development of Japanese-Soviet trade. At the same time, some comprador capitalists in Japan who were willing to serve American imperialism also interfered, attempting to obstruct the normalization of Japanese-Soviet trade in order to undermine good-neighborly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Therefore, after the war, trade between Japan and the Soviet Union only took the form of barter, with many difficulties and a small amount of trade. For example, during the three years from 1948 to 1950, the total trade volume between the two countries was only 24.5 million US dollars. According to Japanese official statistics, in 1955, the value of Japanese exports to the Soviet Union was only 2,076,000 US dollars, and the value of Japanese imports from the Soviet Union was only 3,071,000 US dollars. This figure is less than two-thousandths of Japan's total foreign trade in 1955.
    This stagnant trade situation between Japan and the Soviet Union after the war is very unfavorable to the development of the Japanese economy. Historically, the commodities exported from the Soviet Union to Japan were mainly timber, pulp, coal, petroleum, industrial raw materials, and various machines. These commodities are all beneficial to the development of Japanese production. The ships, fishing nets, rigging, textiles, and other light industrial products and machinery exported from Japan to the Soviet Union are also needed by the Soviet Union. For example, the coal imported by Japan from the Soviet Union is of good quality and cheap. The coal imported from the United States is much more expensive than Soviet coal. Furthermore, 70% of Japan's shipbuilding industry products have always been produced specifically for export. However, after the war, due to Japan's loss of international markets and restrictions imposed by the US "embargo" policy, ship exports were once forced to decrease. Under such circumstances, the Soviet Union's import of some ships from Japan and the repair of ship bottoms in Japan made Japanese business people feel as if they had been blessed with timely rain after a long drought. More importantly, Japan's trade with the Soviet Union will never be as disadvantageous as its trade with the United States. The Soviet Union has always traded with other countries on mutually beneficial terms. The protocol on developing trade and granting each other most-favored-nation status signed by Japan and the Soviet Union this time will be very beneficial to the Japanese national industry and commerce circles, which have been bullied and squeezed out by the United States since the war.
    Therefore, Japanese-Soviet trade will never be as devoid of prospects as some people with ulterior motives in Japan have said; on the contrary, it has great potential for development. This possibility is based on reality. From the Soviet side, with the comprehensive development of communist construction, its foreign trade will also develop. In the Soviet Union, where the laws of socialist economics are fully functioning, the people's living standards are constantly improving, and some light industrial products such as textiles produced in Japan can also find a market in the Soviet Union. Conversely, Japan's need for important industrial raw materials, coal, timber, pulp, and machinery and equipment can also be increasingly imported from the Soviet Union.
    From the Japanese side, trade with the Soviet Union is even more urgently needed and has great prospects. The Japanese economy has always relied on import and export trade. However, after the war, due to US control, foreign markets shrank, and foreign trade has not recovered its vitality. Taking 1955, the year with the highest import and export trade volume after the war, as an example, the export volume was only slightly more than half of Japan's pre-war export level. However, the level of industrial and mining production has increased after the war, exceeding almost double the pre-war level by March 1956. For example, the heavy and chemical industries, shipbuilding industry, textile industry, and especially the man-made fiber industry have all grown quite rapidly after the war. Foreign trade is far from adapting to the growth of production and has begun to affect the further development of many industrial sectors. Therefore, in order to maintain and continue to develop production, many industrial sectors are in urgent need of expanding exports and opening up a path to survival in foreign trade. At the same time, because Japan has a large population and few resources, foreign trade has always been closely related to the issue of employment. Now, Japan's import and export trade has not recovered to the pre-war level, but the population has increased by 30%. Therefore, the sluggish foreign trade has also affected Japan's labor employment.
    Finally, it can also be seen from the prospects for the development of Japanese-Soviet trade in the next five years that the development of trade between the two countries is by no means insignificant to Japan's economic life. In August of this year, the Soviet Union proposed that the total annual Japanese-Soviet trade volume could reach 1 billion rubles (approximately 250 million US dollars) in the next five years. This proposal was warmly supported by Japanese business people. It is estimated that the trade volume of 1 billion rubles is more than 41 times the Japanese-Soviet trade volume in 1955. If the order plan is well implemented, it will play a considerable role in stabilizing the Japanese economy. In a letter to Prime Minister Hatoyama written on October 5th of this year, the Japan-Soviet Trade Association stated that it hopes that in the first year of trade with the Soviet Union (1957), the trade volume between the two sides can reach 76 million US dollars each, which is almost 30 times the Japanese-Soviet trade volume in 1955; and by the fifth year, it will reach 160 million US dollars per side, with a total of more than 1 billion rubles.
    The Japan-Soviet Trade Association, the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, and other business units related to Japanese-Soviet trade formulated a "Five-Year Plan for Japanese-Soviet Trade" on September 18th of this year. This plan reflects the role of Japanese-Soviet trade in today's Japanese economic life. For example, according to this plan, the value of Japanese railway vehicle manufacturing products expected to be exported to the Soviet Union in 1957 is 9,866,000 US dollars, which is almost equivalent to the total export value of this commodity in Japan in 1955. By the fifth year of the trade plan, it will reach four times the total export value of this commodity in 1955. Everyone knows that Japan's railway vehicle manufacturing industry has been experiencing insufficient equipment utilization in recent years. In addition to locomotives, passenger cars and freight cars have all reduced production. Exports are an indispensable condition for maintaining production in this industry. Furthermore, the plan projects to export one million tons of cement to the Soviet Union both next year and in the fifth year. This is a very large quantity, equivalent to 80% of Japan's total cement exports in 1955. According to estimates by Japanese trade circles, if this plan can be realized, coupled with the recent rapid increase in cement exports to China, the export market for Japanese cement will be greatly changed. According to estimates by Japanese economic circles, if the trade plan for imports from the Soviet Union can be realized, the import market for important industrial raw materials (such as iron ore, coking coal, scrap iron, crude oil, etc.) required by Japanese industry can undergo fundamental changes, and Japan can take a step forward in independent and autonomous trade.
    In a commentary in the eleventh issue of the Soviet magazine "International Life" this year, it was mentioned that the Soviet trade authorities believe that under favorable conditions in the future, the commercial trade between the Soviet Union and Japan can also exceed the scale of one billion rubles. Moreover, in the next five years, the Soviet Union will order merchant ships, fishing boats, cranes, railway vehicles, electrical and industrial equipment from Japan, repair ship bottoms in Japan, and will also purchase some consumer goods and raw materials (such as rayon, raw silk, etc.) from Japan. The commodities that the Soviet Union will export are all needed by Japan, such as pulp, coal, manganese ore, chromium ore, apatite, platinum, petroleum, petroleum products, cotton, grain, and so on.
    Although the trade volume and commodity items between Japan and the Soviet Union still need to be specifically negotiated, it is certain that Japanese-Soviet trade will develop more broadly in the future, bringing tangible benefits to Japan's economy and people's livelihood.

    日苏贸易展望
  　万峰
    苏联和日本恢复外交关系之后，两国关于发展贸易和互相给予最惠国待遇的议定书就开始生效了。今后，苏日两国之间的贸易将在新的基础上向前发展，而这对日本工商业和人民生活是特别有利的。
    日本和苏联由于生产发达，地理位置相邻，运输便利，在历史上有过长期的贸易往来。但自从第二次世界战争中断了两国的贸易联系之后，两国之间贸易就一直没有恢复和发展。这是不符合于两国人民利益的。战后十一年来，日苏贸易不能发展的原因，是美帝国主义从中阻挠和破坏。美国占领日本后，它为了保证美国垄断资本在日本进行掠夺，不惜损害日本民族经济，不让日本恢复同邻国贸易，并用所谓“禁运”政策来妨害日苏贸易的发展。同时，日本国内的一部分甘愿为美帝国主义效劳的买办资本家，也从中作梗，企图以妨碍日苏贸易的正常化，达到破坏日苏善邻关系的目的。因此，战后日本和苏联之间的贸易，只是采取换货的方式，困难重重，贸易数额甚少。如在1948年到1950年这三年期间，两国贸易额总共只有二千四百五十万美元。据日本官方统计，1955年日本向苏联出口的价值只有二百零七万六千美元，日本从苏联进口的价值只有三百零七万一千美元。这个数字还不到1955年日本对外贸易总额的千分之二。
    战后日苏贸易的这种停滞不前的贸易状况，对于日本经济的发展是非常不利的。从历史上看，苏联向日本出口的商品，主要是木材、纸浆、煤炭、石油、工业原料和各种机器。这些商品都是有利于日本生产发展的。而日本向苏联出口的船只、渔网、索具、纺织品等轻工业产品和机器，也是苏联所需要的。如日本从苏联进口的煤，质量好，价格便宜。而从美国进口的煤比苏联煤要贵得多。再如，日本的造船工业产品中，一向有70％是专为出口而生产的。但战后由于日本丧失了国际市场，并受美国“禁运”政策限制，船只出口一度被迫减少。在那种情况下，苏联从日本进口一些船只和在日本修理船底，使日本企业界人士感到如同久旱逢甘霖。更重要的是，日本同苏联进行贸易，绝不会像同美国进行贸易那样一味吃亏。苏联同其它国家贸易一向是在双方有利的条件下进行的。这次日苏两国签订的关于发展贸易和互相给予最惠国待遇的议定书，对于战后一直受美国欺压和排挤的日本民族工商界，将是十分有利的。
    因此，日苏贸易决不会像日本国内一些别有用心的人所说的那样没有前途；正相反，它有着很大发展的可能。这种可能性是有现实的基础的。从苏联方面说，随着共产主义建设的全面发展，它的对外贸易也会发展。在社会主义经济规律充分起作用的苏联，人民生活水平不断提高，日本出产的一些纺织品等轻工业制品在苏联也可以找到销路。反过来，日本所需要的重要工业原料、煤炭、木材、纸浆和机器设备，也可以日益增多地从苏联进口。
    从日本方面说，对苏贸易更有切身的需要和很大的前途。日本经济一向仰赖进出口贸易。但是，战后由于受美国控制，国外市场缩小，对外贸易一直没有恢复原气。就以战后进出口贸易额最高的1955年来说，出口额也只及战前日本出口水平的一半多一点。但战后工矿业生产水平却有了增长，到1956年3月已超过战前近一倍。如重化学工业、造船工业、纺织工业、特别是人造纤维工业战后都有相当快的增长。对外贸易远不能适应生产增长的情况，已开始影响到许多工业部门生产的进一步发展。因此，为了维持和继续发展生产，许多工业部门都急需扩大出口，在对外贸易方面打开一条生路。同时，因为日本人口较多，资源较少，对外贸易一向同就业问题有密切关系。现在日本进出口贸易未恢复到战前水平，而人口却增加了30％，因此对外贸易的不景气还影响到了日本的劳动就业。
    最后，从今后五年内日苏贸易发展的前景也可以看出，两国贸易的发展对日本经济生活绝非无足轻重。今年8月间，苏联曾建议今后五年内日苏贸易每年双方合计可达十亿卢布（约合二亿五千万美元）。这个建议受到日本工商界人士的热烈拥护。据估计，十亿卢布的贸易额相当于1955年日苏贸易额的四十一倍多，如订货计划执行得好，将对日本经济的稳定起相当大的作用。日本日苏贸易协会于今年10月5日写给鸠山首相的信中表示，希望同苏联贸易的第一年（1957年），双方的贸易额能各达七千六百万美元，这几乎等于1955年日苏贸易额的三十倍；而到第五年度时，将达到每方一亿六千万美元，双方合计超过十亿卢布。
    日苏贸易协会、日本国际贸易促进协会和其它同日苏贸易有关的企业单位，在今年9月18日制定了一个“日苏贸易五年计划”。这个计划反映了日苏贸易对今天日本经济生活的作用。比如，按照这个计划，日本铁路车辆制造业产品预计在1957年向苏联出口的价值为九百八十六万六千美元，差不多相当于1955年日本这项商品的出口总值。到贸易计划的第五年度时，更将达到1955年的这项商品出口总值的四倍。大家知道，日本铁路车辆制造业近年来有设备利用率不足的现象，除机车外，客车、货车都已减产。出口是维持该行业生产所不可缺少的条件。再如，计划中预定向苏联出口的水泥明年和第五年度同为一百万吨，这个数量很大，相当于1955年日本水泥出口总量的80％。据日本贸易界人士估计，这项计划如能实现，再加上最近对中国出口的水泥数量迅速增加，会使日本水泥的输出市场大为改观。据日本经济界人士估计，如能实现自苏进口的贸易计划，日本工业所需的重要工业原料（如铁矿石、焦炭、废铁、原油等）的输入市场可起根本变化，并使日本在独立自主贸易上迈进一步。
    今年第十一期苏联“国际生活”杂志在一篇评论中提到，苏联贸易机关认为今后在有利的条件下，苏日两国的通商贸易还可以超过十亿卢布的规模。而且在今后五年内，苏联将向日本订购商船、渔船、起重机、铁路车辆、电力及工业设备，在日本修理船底，此外还将自日本购买若干种消费品和原料（如人造丝、生丝等）。而苏联将出口的商品，都是日本所需要的纸浆、煤炭、锰矿石、铬矿石、磷灰矿石、白金、石油、石油制品、棉花、粮食等等。
    虽然日苏双方的贸易数额、商品项目等还有待具体的协商，但可以肯定的是，今后日苏贸易定会更广阔地发展起来，给日本的经济和人民生活带来看得见的好处。
