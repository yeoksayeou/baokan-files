    Technician's Diary
    Xiao Xiang
    October 22

    This morning, the team leader informed me that there would be a meeting at the factory director's office at 8 o'clock. I felt somewhat surprised. I thought the factory directors were so busy, how could they have time to call us for a meeting? Perhaps it's about the quality issues. It's the end of the year, and we have to rush to complete the tasks. If the quality is not good, we are bound to be criticized!

    We entered the unfamiliar factory director's office and sat down against the wall. The meeting was presided over by the deputy factory director and chief engineer. The Party Secretary also participated. It was indeed about quality issues. I took notes on the quality problems of the fifty-ton gondola car axle boxes, which were related to me.

    Poor quality castings not only affect the casting workshop's ability to complete its plan but also implicate the machining workshop. Of course, they would complain at the meeting. Now that the factory director and the Party Secretary are personally supervising the battle, we soldiers holding our weapons are indeed in high spirits. The problem is expected to be solved soon!

    October 24

    This morning, I went to the workshop with the engineers to work with the responsible comrades to formulate measures and a schedule for improving quality. The plan for improving the quality of the axle boxes has also been established.

    October 27

    I went to the workshop and worked with the technicians and foreman to study the reasons for the poor quality of the axle boxes. We tentatively determined the technological improvement methods. This is like a military conference before a battle, analyzing the enemy situation obtained from reconnaissance and deciding on the battle route and the deployment of forces. Now we need to issue orders!

    In the afternoon, I reported the situation to the relevant leaders.

    October 28

    The plan for improving the axle box process was approved by the leadership and issued to the relevant units in the form of a notice.

    In the afternoon, the trial work for improving the quality of the axle box began. I received a phone call asking me to go. When I got there, nothing was happening. I asked the foreman, and he said that they were going to prepare the cores, and the sand molds couldn't be made yet.

    Although it was a false alarm, I was happy to make a few extra trips.

    October 29

    The trial production of improved axle boxes began today with the making of sand molds, and pouring can begin in the evening.

    November 1

    The trial-produced axle boxes have had their risers removed. A total of eight were tested. Judging from the situation after cutting the risers, shrinkage has been eliminated. This is a gratifying achievement, which indeed gives one a sense of "success upon the first move"!

    These axle boxes will be put into the kiln for heat treatment tonight and sent out tomorrow. If there is no shrinkage at all after machining, then we are sure that this battle is victorious. Although we can already see the clues, we should still maintain a cautious attitude, because accidents may fall from the sky when we are intoxicated by "carelessness"!

    November 4

    As expected, something went wrong. The eight axle boxes from the previous test are missing.

    This kind of thing is "commonplace" here. How many processes does it take to test and research a casting? There's molding, closing the box, pouring, knocking out the box, cleaning the sand, annealing, sending, and the scribing and machining in the machining workshop... The experimenters, who are operating with great difficulty, cannot hold the castings in their arms, so they disappear without a trace. It's really difficult! If the castings could talk, that would be great. When we go to find them, they would wave their hands and respond with their voices. Wouldn't that be wonderful!

    I remember in school, the teachers said that conclusions about quality improvement can be drawn from technical experiments. At that time, I was sitting in the classroom, and I thought the teacher was right. But what about now? I don't think the teacher was wrong, but the teacher didn't teach me what to do when the castings are lost by someone else and can't even be seen. How can we draw conclusions?

    November 5

    The eight axle boxes for the experiment were lost. Helplessly, we produced two more days according to the improved process. The workshop leaders agreed. Producing for two days is quite a lot. In fact, we don't need that many. There is a very large insurance coefficient here: Surely not all of them will be lost!

    I heard that the workshop leaders criticized the workshop technicians because the experimental products were lost. I thought about it carefully for a long time. If I were the workshop director, I would indeed be angry. Why were the experimental products lost? But then I thought, if I were the workshop technician, I would feel wronged. The workshop technician can't put the experimental products in his pocket. The castings are processed on the production line. What can the technician do?

    November 9

    The experimental axle boxes have already been heat-treated and should be sent to the machining workshop, but the central laboratory has not finished analyzing the chemical composition of the axle boxes. Without a report showing that the chemical composition is合格 (qualified), the inspectors will not allow them to be sent out!

    November 10

    The experimental axle boxes have not been sent out yet. How slow is the central laboratory's analysis work!

    November 11

    The experimental products have not been sent out because the analysis work is not complete.

    November 14

    The experimental axle boxes have been sent out. Although dozens were made, only nine were sent out. We went to take a look and found them scattered in the warehouse. Oh my god, why did they have to be put in the warehouse? Weren't they supposed to be sent directly to the workshop?

    Although there were only nine, we were as happy as if we were looking at our own nine children, like nine seeds we had sown. Our hopes are pinned on these nine seeds, hoping they will germinate, blossom, and bear fruit.

    We went to the scheduling group of the machining workshop to ask them to do their best to process them quickly. In fact, this is also helping themselves, because it can save them from always having to repair the axle boxes due to poor quality. But they said that it is impossible to process them recently. There is really no way! I remember that when we had a meeting in the factory director's office, the factory director instructed that these quality improvement test pieces should be processed with priority, but the order was not carried out, like a spring breeze that blows away!

    I wish the factory leaders could take pity on the casting workshop and generously give it a lathe. Then we might not have to come and beg on our knees. If that were the case, all experimental products could be cut on the lathe immediately. How happy that would be!

    I think that in college, the school authorities promoted the benefits of studying construction and repeatedly tried to persuade young people not to necessarily study design. But why doesn't the state use its propaganda power and persuasion power to improve factory management? If that were the case, there would be no need to persuade them, and young people would be happy to study construction technology. Otherwise, even if they are persuaded in school, they will still cry out in the factory!

    I think the factory may not need people to do technical work, like me, who is called a technician. Looking back on the past, after reading this diary for nearly a month, I have simply been doing the work of a messenger, running errands. This is probably the old chestnut of technical personnel "not doing their jobs properly." If the technician could have the power to enforce orders like the scheduler, the problem might not be solved easily, but it would be better than this old ox-drawn cart situation!

    Nearly two-thirds of this month has passed, and the progress plan for improving the quality of axle boxes has fallen far behind, but what can I do?

    November 23

    We went to the machining workshop again to see the trial-produced axle boxes and circled six more with red paint. They are still piled up in the warehouse!

    I don't know who should be in charge of this kind of problem in the factory, or who can manage these problems, but I do know that I have no way. My greatest skill is to go to request and visit every day. I also know that the improvement of product quality in the factory should not be based on the technician's pleas and begging!

    Tomorrow I will go to plead and beg again...

    技术员的日记
    肖襄
    十月二十二日
    上午组长通知说八点钟到厂长室开会，我觉得有些突然，想厂长们工作繁忙，怎么会有时间召集我们这些人开会呢？也许是质量不好吧，到年末了又得赶任务，质量不好，难免去受批评！
    我们走进生疏的厂长室，在靠墙地方坐下，会议由副厂长兼总工程师主持。党委书记也参加了。确是质量问题。我记下了与我有关的五十吨棚车轴箱质量问题。
    铸件质量不好，不但影响铸造车间完不成计划，而且连累了加工车间，当然人家要在会上诉苦了。现在，厂长和党委书记亲自出马督战，我们这些执戈临阵的战士确也斗志甚高，问题可望指日而下！
    十月二十四日
    上午和工程师们到车间会同负责同志，制订改进质量的措施进度计划，改进轴箱质量的措施计划也订出来了。
    十月二十七日
    到车间和技术员、工段长一起研究轴箱质量不好的原因，初步确定了工艺上的改进方法，这像是军队在战役前的军事会议一样，将侦察所得的敌情做分析，决定了战斗的路线和力量的调遣使用，现在需要下命令了！
    下午把情况向有关领导作了汇报。
    十月二十八日
    改进轴箱工艺的方案，经领导批准，用通知发至有关单位。
    下午轴箱质量改进的试验工作开始，来电话要我去，去了，却没有事。问工段长，说是将要准备打芯子，砂型还不能做。
    虽是谎报军情，我也乐于多跑几趟。
    十月二十九日
    改进轴箱的试制工作今天开始制砂型，到晚上就可以开始浇注。
    十一月一日
    试制的轴箱，已经割去了浇冒口，共试验了八个，从切割浇冒口后的情况看来，已经消灭了缩空，这是一个可喜的收获，确使人有“旗开得胜，马到成功”的快感！
    这些轴箱今天晚上入窑进行热处理，明天发出，如果加工后完全没有缩空，那就肯定我们这次战斗是胜利了。虽然现在已经可以遥见端绪，但还应该保持谨慎态度，因为意外可能在“大意”陶醉的时候自天而降！
    十一月四日
    果然出了事。前次试验的八个轴箱找不到了。
    像这种事情在我们这里已是“司空见惯”的了，试验研究一个铸件要经过多少工序呀，要造型，合箱，浇注，打箱，清砂，退火，发送，以及加工车间的划线，加工……等，惨淡经营的试验者们，又不能把铸件抱在怀里，于是就不翼而飞了，真难呀！如果铸件会讲话那就好了，当我们去找它时，它会招之以手，应之以声，岂不快哉！
    我记得在学校里，老师们说改进质量可以从技术试验得出结论。那时候我坐在课堂上，觉得老师说的真对。而现在呢？我并不认为老师说错了，但老师却没有教会我当铸件被别人丢了，连看都看不见的时候，结论又如何去作？
    十一月五日
    试验的八个轴箱弄丢了，无奈何又按照改进的工艺再生产两天。车间领导同意了，生产两天数量可真不少，其实用不了那么多，这里面是打了个很大的保险系数：总不会全丢吧！
    听说因为试验品丢了，车间领导批评了车间技术员。我仔细想了半天，如果我是车间主任，确实我也会生气，为什么试验品弄丢了呢？但是我又想，如果我是车间技术员，我心里就会觉得冤屈，车间技术员也不能把试验品装在口袋里，铸件在生产线上进行，技术员有什么办法呢？
    十一月九日
    试验的轴箱早已进行了热处理，应该发到加工车间去，但是中央实验室分析轴箱的化学成份还没有结束，如果没有化学成份合格的报告单，检查人员是不允许发出的！
    十一月十日
    试验轴箱还未发出，中央实验室的分析工作何其慢！
    十一月十一日
    试验品因分析工作未完仍未发出。
    十一月十四日
    试验的轴箱发出了，虽然做了几十个，但是发出的只有九个。我们去看了一下，被零散地放在仓库里。天呀，为什么要入库呢？不是说直接送到车间里去吗？
    虽然只有九个，我们高兴得像看待自己亲生的九个孩子一样，像是播下的九个种子，我们的希望寄托在这九个种子身上，凭它发芽开花结果。
    我们去加工车间调度组请求他们鼎力帮助快些加工，其实这也是帮助他们自己，因为可以省得他们总是因为轴箱质量不好铲焊返修，但是人家说最近不可能加工，真没办法！
    十一月十九日
    已经过去几天了，送到加工车间的试验品仍未加工，如果再拖几天，谁能保证这些轴箱不会又被弄丢？为了防患于未然，我们去借了一筒红油漆，把试验品上圈了许多圈，以志其异，然后又去向调度哀求，希望能尽先将有红圈的加工，但仍不得要领。记得当初在厂长室开会时，厂长指示这些改进质量的试验件应优先加工，然而竟令出不行，无异于拂面而去的春风一阵！
    我想要是工厂领导能可怜可怜铸造车间，大发慈悲发给它一台车床，那该多好啊，那我们也许不会来三跪九叩首地哀求了，如果是那样的话，凡是试验品马上可以上床子切削，乐何如之！
    我想在大学时，学校当局宣传说学施工的好，并且一再替青年打通思想，要他们不必一定学设计，但是国家为什么不把宣传力量和打通思想的力量用在改进工厂管理工作上呢？如果是那样，不用打通思想，青年们也乐于学施工工艺，否则即使在学校被打通了思想，到工厂里还会呼天叫冤的！
    我想工厂里也许用不着做技术工作的人，比如说名之为技术员的我，缅怀往昔，看了这近一个月的日记，简直作的都是通风报信的跑龙套工作，这大概是老生常谈的技术人员“不务正业”了，如果技术员能像调度员一样执令在手，问题虽未必迎刃而解，但总会胜过这种老牛破车的情况！
    这个月已过去了将近三分之二，改进轴箱质量的进度计划大大落后了，但是我有什么办法呢？
    十一月二十三日
    我们又去加工车间看望试制的轴箱，又用红漆圈了六个，仍然堆压在仓库里！
    我不知道这类问题在工厂里应该谁管，谁能管得了这些问题，我却知道我可是没办法，我最大的本领是每天去请求和看望，我同时也知道工厂里产品质量的改进似乎不应该建立在技术员哀告乞求的基础上！
    明天我再去哀告和乞求……
