Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 6th: The pneumatic drill workers responsible for constructing the Guiding Tunnel on the Duyun-Guiyang section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway drilled a large hole more than one meter deep from the eastern entrance of the tunnel on the 5th. Thus, the three larger tunnels on this section of the line, Guiding, Dongshanping, and Shangzhai, have all started excavation.

　　The Dongshanping and Shangzhai tunnels were excavated in early and mid-October respectively. By the end of November, the east and west entrances of the Dongshanping Tunnel had been drilled more than seventy meters; although more than eighty meters of the western entrance of the Shangzhai Tunnel was soft earth, which affected the progress of the project, the workers adopted a method of excavating and building walls simultaneously, and had already dug more than forty meters.

　　黔桂路上的大隧道开工
    据新华社贵阳6日电　担负修建黔桂铁路都（匀）筑（贵阳）段贵定隧道的风钻工人，5日从这个隧道的东口，凿进了一公尺多深的一个大洞。这样，这段线路上的贵定、东山坪和上寨三个较大的隧道，已经全部开挖进洞。
    东山坪和上寨两个隧道是在10月上、中旬先后开挖进洞的。到11月下旬为止，东山坪隧道东西两洞口已经凿进七十多公尺；上寨隧道西口虽然有八十多公尺的地段是松软的土方，影响了工程进度，但是工人们采用边开挖边砌墙的工作方法，也已经挖进四十多公尺。
