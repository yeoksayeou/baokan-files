Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 29th -- The Fujian Provincial People's Committee has decided to launch a regular and sustained production increase and thrift campaign throughout the province. This decision was made at the plenary meeting of the Provincial People's Committee held on December 27th and 28th. In accordance with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the specific conditions of Fujian Province, the meeting believed that future efforts to increase production and practice thrift should mainly focus on three aspects: First, comprehensively develop production and strictly control planning. It is required to first ensure the completion of agricultural production increase tasks, and vigorously develop various local and special products. Industrial and handicraft products with guaranteed raw materials and sales should be actively increased in production. Second, resolutely curtail non-productive expenditures. It was decided that, except for foreign guests, there would be no banquets or gifts, meetings, reports, telegrams, and telephone expenses would be reduced, public miscellaneous expenses would be strictly saved, and it was stipulated that departments would no longer buy cars in the future, and the use of existing cars would be strictly controlled. Third, streamline organizations, requiring a 30% reduction in the existing personnel of provincial-level agencies, and transferring these cadres to production units, grassroots organizations, and economic positions. The meeting specifically pointed out that to do this work well, it is necessary to carry out in-depth ideological education and gradually complete it. The meeting also decided to no longer transfer personnel detached from production from township cadres.
	The meeting required that leadership be strengthened in the future, and that production increase and thrift activities be carried out in a planned, prepared, and steady manner. In terms of steps and methods, it was stipulated that on the basis of studying the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, ideological education on increasing production and practicing thrift should be carried out extensively and deeply, the causes of extravagance and waste should be analyzed, and a plan for increasing production and practicing thrift should be drawn up, so as to consolidate the results ideologically and institutionally, and make increasing production and practicing thrift lasting and regular.

    福建决定采取三项措施
    全省展开增产节约活动
    全面发展生产；紧缩非生产性开支；精简机构
    新华社福州29日电　福建省人民委员会决定在全省范围内开展一个经常的持久的增产节约活动。这个决定是在12月27日和28日召开的省人民委员会全体会议上作出的。根据中共八届二中全会的精神和福建省的具体情况，会议认为今后开展增产节约主要应该从三方面来努力：第一，要全面发展生产，严格控制计划。要求首先保证完成农业增产任务，并且大力发展各项土产和特产。对于原料有保证又有销路的工业、手工业产品应积极增产。其次，坚决紧缩非生产性的开支。决定除外宾以外，不宴会，不送礼，减少会议、表报、电报和电话费，严格节约公杂费用，并且规定今后各部门不再买小汽车，对现有的汽车的使用加以严格控制。第三，要精简机构，要求从省级机关的现有人员中精简30％，把这些干部输送到生产单位、基层组织和经济岗位上。会议特别指出，要做好这项工作，必须进行深入的思想教育，逐步地完成。会议还决定不再从乡干部中抽调脱离生产的人员。
    会议要求今后加强领导，有计划地、有准备地、稳步地开展增产节约活动。在步骤和方法上规定在学习中共第八次全国代表大会文件的基础上，广泛深入地进行增产节约的思想教育，分析产生铺张浪费的原因，订出增产节约方案，做到从思想上、制度上巩固成果，使增产节约持久、经常。
