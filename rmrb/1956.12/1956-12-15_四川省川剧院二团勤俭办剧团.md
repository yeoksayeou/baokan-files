Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 14th: The Second Troupe of the Sichuan Province Sichuan Opera Theater, which used to require state funding, has begun to turn over profits to the state this year.

Improving the quality of performances and enriching the repertoire are the main ways the Second Troupe has increased its income. This year, the Second Troupe performed mostly excellent traditional Sichuan opera pieces that have been newly excavated or reorganized. They adopted the method of grouping actors for rehearsal, cross-performing plays, and having old actors mentor new actors, so that the troupe often has new plays to perform. In the past, this troupe always performed only a few plays such as "Yu He Bridge" and "Interrogation of Hong", and the attendance rate was not high; this year, they newly rehearsed and performed large-scale plays such as "Jingchai Ji" and "Orphan Ji", twelve plays in total, and the attendance rate averaged over 92%.

This troupe pays special attention to economizing on administrative and stage expenses. After implementing fixed staffing and quotas, the total number of personnel in the troupe this year has been reduced by half compared to last year. They also launched a competition to cherish public property and save on stage expenses. The personnel in charge of props made many props themselves; the makeup team saved a lot of makeup supplies; the costume team also came up with ways to utilize waste materials, reuse old materials, and renovate them to make costumes.

    四川省川剧院二团勤俭办剧团
    据新华社成都14日电　往年需要国家拨款补助的四川省川剧院第二团，今年已经开始把利润上缴给国家。
    提高演出质量、丰富上演剧目，是第二团增加收入的主要办法。今年第二团上演的大都是新发掘或整理出来的川剧优秀传统剧目，他们采用演员分组排练，剧目交叉演出和老演员带新演员的办法，使得剧团经常有新剧目上演。过去，这个团老是上演“御河桥”、“拷红”等少数几个戏，上座率不高；今年，他们新排练演出的大型戏就有“荆钗记”、“孤儿记”等十二个剧目，上座率平均达到92％以上。
    这个团特别注意在行政和舞台费用上的节约。实行定员定额后，全团人员今年比去年减少了一半。他们还开展了爱护公物、节约舞台费用的竞赛。管理道具的人员自己制造了很多道具；化装组节约了不少化装用品；服装组也想出废物利用、翻旧改新等办法做戏衣。
