    Overcoming the Tendency to Focus Solely on Sideline Businesses
    Wu乡 County Agricultural Cooperatives Comprehensively Plan Winter Production
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Chinese Communist Party Wu乡 County Committee in Shanxi Province reversed the tendency of some cadres to focus solely on sideline businesses and neglect winter agricultural production. Agricultural production cooperatives throughout the county have made comprehensive arrangements for winter agricultural and sideline production, as well as capital construction work.
    Wu乡 County suffered severe natural disasters this year. After the struggle against the disaster, the county's crop yield was still equal to last year's, but 30.4% of the agricultural production cooperatives experienced reduced production due to the disaster. In order to make up for losses or develop sideline production, many agricultural cooperatives have only focused on sideline businesses to obtain immediate cash income since the beginning of winter, neglecting agricultural production to some extent. For example, Hongshui Township planned to open ten workshops, organize two hundred people to engage in carrying and transporting goods, use one hundred and fifty livestock to transport and sell coal, and assign eighty laborers to burn lime; Tuhe Agricultural Cooperative planned to have all its labor force go out to engage in sideline businesses this winter; Zhaiping Cooperative planned to use seventy laborers to engage in sideline businesses in the winter, with each person earning sixty yuan, so that each person could buy a small overcoat for the New Year. There were no specific plans for agricultural production and capital construction. The plans of many other cooperatives were roughly the same.
    At the three-level cadre meeting held in mid-November, the Chinese Communist Party Wu乡 County Committee examined and criticized the above-mentioned ideological tendency of lacking long-term production and construction, and organized four hundred propagandists to carry out publicity and education among the masses. Many cadres and masses realized that it was wrong to focus solely on sideline businesses and neglect agriculture. For example, the members of the Niu家庄 Agricultural Cooperative said: If we don't make production preparations in winter, we will produce less grain next year, and we won't be able to buy it back even if we have money; moreover, if grain production is reduced, it will also affect national construction. All forty-five townships and two hundred and ten agricultural cooperatives in the county have made comprehensive plans for winter production. According to statistics, a total of 50,252 laborers in the county will be投入 in water conservancy construction, soil and water conservation, soil improvement, building livestock pens, and accumulating fertilizer; 10,050 people will participate in workshops, transportation, and various temporary sideline production activities. It is estimated that sideline production can increase income by more than 296,000 yuan, with an average increase of more than eight yuan per household. For the cooperatives that have suffered more severe disasters, the county committee plans to implement work relief, that is, larger capital construction projects will be undertaken with state loans, and cooperative members will be paid wages according to fixed quotas.

    克服单纯经营副业的思想倾向
    武乡县农业社全面安排冬季生产
    本报讯　中共山西省武乡县委员会扭转部分干部单纯经营副业、忽视冬季农业生产的思想倾向，全县农业生产合作社对冬季农、副业生产和基本建设工作作了全面安排。
    武乡县今年遭受严重的自然灾害。经过抗灾斗争，全县农作物产量仍和去年相等，但有30.4％的农业生产合作社因灾减产。许多农业社为了弥补损失或发展副业生产，入冬以来只注意搞副业抓现钱，对农业生产有所忽视。如洪水乡计划开设作坊十座，组织二百人搞担挑运输，一百五十头牲口驮卖煤、八十个劳力烧石灰；土河农业社计划今冬全部劳力都出外去搞副业；寨坪社计划用七十个劳力在冬季搞副业，每人挣钱六十元，到过年的时候每人买件小大衣。农业生产和基本建设都没有具体计划。其他许多社的计划也大体如此。
    中共武乡县委在11月中旬召开的三级干部会议上，检查和批判了上述缺乏长期生产建设的思想倾向，并组织四百名宣传员，向群众进行宣传教育。许多干部和群众都认识了单纯经营副业、忽视农业是错误的。如牛家庄农业社的社员们说：冬天不作生产准备，明年少产了粮食，有钱也是买不回来；况且粮食少产了，还会影响国家建设。全县四十五个乡，二百一十个农业社都作了冬季生产的全面规划。据统计，全县将共有五万零二百五十二个劳力投入兴修水利、水土保持、改良土壤、修圈、积肥等工作；有一万零五十人参加作坊、运输及临时性的各种副业生产。估计副业生产可增加收入二十九万六千多元，平均每户可增加收入八元多。受灾较重的社，县委准备实行以工代赈，即较大的基本建设由国家贷款举办，社员定额作活领取工资。
