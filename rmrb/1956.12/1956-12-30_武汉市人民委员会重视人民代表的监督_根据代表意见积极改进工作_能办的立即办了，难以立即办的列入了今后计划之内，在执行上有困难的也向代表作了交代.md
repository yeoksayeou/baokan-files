(Reported by Changjiang Daily) Before the first session of the Second Wuhan Municipal People's Congress, the Municipal People's Committee conducted a comprehensive review and inspection of the implementation of the opinions on the government's work put forward by the representatives of the previous People's Congress. The inspection proved that, with the exception of a very few units where problems existed in the implementation of representatives' opinions, the vast majority of opinions had been earnestly implemented. The general situation is that representatives put forward a total of 1,231 opinions, of which 1,120 have now been addressed, accounting for more than 90% of all opinions. Of the remainder, apart from 38 items that have not been handled by the Municipal Handicraft Bureau, 20 items transferred to higher levels, and 4 items that could not be explained due to unclear circumstances, there are also 49 items for which plans have been drafted or are being studied and processed.

The Party and the government attach great importance to this issue and have repeatedly taken measures to require all departments to handle promptly the opinions put forward by the people's representatives that should be and can be handled. The inspection proves that all departments have implemented this instruction. For example, the problems existing in the grain supply work raised by the representatives have been dealt with after investigation by the relevant departments. On the issue of grain quality, specific measures have been taken, such as newly stipulating "impurity content standards," "processing according to quality," and requiring all rice mills to implement "more wind, more sifting, and more screening" operation methods. In addition, preparations are being made to add necessary equipment and trial-run a "no-impurity processing rice mill." In terms of improving the supply system and service attitude, changes were made to the original business hours from the perspective of facilitating the people, grain supply points were increased and adjusted in some areas, and in conjunction with labor competitions, a meeting of business personnel was convened in a timely manner to conduct ideological education, and a system for company managers to visit mass representatives was established. In response to the representatives' request to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to improve the quality of drivers and ensure driving safety, the Municipal Supervisory Bureau and other units promptly established a joint inspection team to inspect the traffic accidents of the Municipal Public Automobile Company, and also came up with a series of improvement measures, including strengthening political and ideological education, strict examination systems, improving education policies, and extending the training time for new drivers, and revised the reward and punishment system with driving safety as the main focus. The educational authorities also took timely measures to address the issues raised by the representatives regarding teachers and improving teaching quality, and came up with solutions such as merging the Education Bureau's Teaching and Research Office with the Teacher Training College, establishing teaching and research offices for various subjects in middle schools, establishing municipal and district teaching and research offices in primary schools, holding primary school administrative training classes, and opening three correspondence schools to solve the problems. In addition, the government departments have also attached importance to and dealt with responsibly and promptly the issues raised by the representatives such as the monotonous repertoire of performances, the insufficient supply of kerosene, the need to maintain the characteristics of the catering industry, the need to solve the employment problems of semi-labor women in the streets, and the need to improve the quality of industrial products such as cigarettes, soaps, Hanfen wine, and Nan wine.

Some of the opinions that were difficult to implement immediately have been included in future plans by the relevant government departments. For example, the Municipal Culture Bureau has included in its 1957 plan the representatives' proposal to build a cultural palace in the Water District. The Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative Production Materials Management Department has also formulated a plan to establish a manure management station in Qingshan District, which has been included in the 1957 plan.

Regarding the opinions raised by the representatives that were difficult to implement due to limited conditions or could not be implemented at all, efforts were made to find solutions and responsibly explain the situation to the representatives. For example, regarding the issue raised by the representatives that the supply of raw materials such as steel bars, cement, and wood required for basic construction and industry was insufficient, the relevant departments, on the one hand, made detailed explanations to the representatives based on the actual situation such as national production and market needs, and at the same time actively tried to organize sources of goods to resolve the contradiction.

In the process of handling the representatives' opinions, various departments adopted various organizational measures, and many leaders personally went deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research, which was beneficial to strengthening the ties between the government and the people, overcoming bureaucracy in leadership, and improving government work. For example, Xie, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Li, the deputy director, visited Yu Xiuying, a female representative of Jianghan District, and the Residents' Committee of Outang Village, respectively, to understand the work style and policy implementation of grassroots cadres from the masses. Song, the director of the Municipal Transportation Administration Bureau, accompanied the representatives to Qingshan and other places for inspections. Yuan, the director of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, conducted an in-depth investigation into the case of Liu Cuilan, who was injured in a fire and had no one to take care of her, based on the opinions of the people's representatives. In addition to promptly sending her to the hospital and covering all medical and food expenses, he also personally went to the hospital to express his condolences. Some departments made a comprehensive consideration of "drawing inferences about other cases from one instance" from the individual opinions raised by the representatives, and fundamentally improved the government's work. For example, in response to the opinion raised by the representatives to the Municipal Public Security Bureau that the traffic police in the Liuduqiao and Nanjing Road areas had a poor service attitude, the leaders of the Public Security Bureau considered that this was not an isolated phenomenon, and therefore conducted a comprehensive review of the ideological style of the traffic police, universally organized the study of strengthening the concept of the legal system and the mass perspective, and improved the working methods and service attitude of the traffic police throughout the city.

    武汉市人民委员会重视人民代表的监督
    根据代表意见积极改进工作
    能办的立即办了，难以立即办的列入了今后计划之内，在执行上有困难的也向代表作了交代
    本报讯　据长江日报报道，在武汉市第二届人民代表大会第一次会议召开之前，市人民委员会对上届人民代表大会代表们对政府工作所提意见的执行情况，进行了一次全面的整理和检查。检查证明：除了极个别单位在执行代表意见中存在着问题以外，绝大部分的意见都已得到了认真贯彻。总的情况是：代表们共提出一千二百三十一条意见，现在已经处理了的有一千一百二十条，占全部意见90％以上。余下来的除了市手工业局有三十八条没有处理、二十条转送上级和四条因情况交代不清而无法作出交代的以外，还有四十九条或已拟定了方案，或正在研究处理中。
    党和政府十分重视这一问题，曾经一再采取措施，要求各部门对人民代表提出的意见中应办而又可以办的，必须及时处理，检查证明各部门是贯彻了这一指示的。例如代表们对粮食供应工作中存在的问题，经过有关部门的调查，都已得到了处理——在粮食质量问题上，采取了从新规定“含杂规格”、“按质加工”和要求各米厂实行“多风、多溜、多筛”的操作方法等具体措施外，还准备添置必要设备和试办一个“无杂加工米厂”；在改进供应制度和服务态度方面，从便利人民出发，变更了原来营业时间，增加和调整了部分地区的粮食供应点，并结合劳动竞赛，及时召开了营业员大会进行思想教育，并规定了公司经理访问群众代表的制度；代表们要求市公用事业管理局提高司机质量，保证行车安全，市监察局等单位及时成立了联合检查组，对市公用汽车公司的行车事故进行了检查，也想出了一系列改进的办法，其中包括加强政治思想教育，严格考试制度，改善教育方针和延长新司机的训练时间，并且修订了以行车安全为主的奖惩制度等。代表们对教育部门提出的有关师资和提高教学质量问题也及时采取了措施，想出了把教育局教研室与教师进修学院合并，设立了中学各科教研室，小学也设立了市和区的教研室，举办小学行政训练班和开办三个函授学校等办法来解决问题。此外如代表们提出的上演剧目单调的问题，煤油供应量太少的问题，保持饮食业特点的问题，解决街道中半劳动妇女工作问题，改善香烟、肥皂、汉汾酒和南酒等工业品质量问题，都得到了政府各部门的重视，及时作了负责处理。
    在意见中有些难以立即办到的，有关政府部门已列入了今后计划中。如代表们提出要在水上区建立一个文化宫，市文化局已列入了1957年计划；代表们提出在青山区成立一个粪便管理所问题，也由市供销合作社生产资料经理部拟定了方案，列入了1957年的计划。
    在代表们提出的意见中，有些受条件限制在执行上有困难或者根本无法办到的，也都尽可能想了办法和负责向代表作了交代。例如代表们提出基本建设和工业所需要钢筋、水泥、木材等原料供应不上的问题，有关部门一方面根据国家生产和市场需要等实际情况，向代表作了详细解释，同时也积极设法组织货源，力求解决这中间的矛盾。
    在处理代表意见过程中，各部门采取了各种组织措施，许多首长亲自深入群众，进行了调查研究，对密切政府与人民之间的联系，克服领导上的官僚主义和改进政府工作，都有好处。例如市公安局谢局长和李副局长，分别访问了江汉区妇女代表余秀英和藕塘村居民委员会等，向群众了解基层干部的工作作风和执行政策等情况；市交通运输管理局宋局长伴同代表到青山等地进行了视察；市民政局袁局长根据人民代表意见，深入调查了刘翠兰因救火负伤无人照顾问题，除了及时把她送入医院，负担全部医药、伙食费用外，还亲到医院进行了慰问。有些部门从代表提出的个别意见中，作了“举一反三”的全面考虑，从根本性质上改进了政府工作。如代表们向市公安局提出的意见中，说六渡桥、南京路一带的交通民警服务态度不好，公安局领导上考虑到这不是个别现象，从而对交通民警的思想作风进行了一次全面检查，普遍组织了加强法制观点和群众观点的学习，全市性地改进了交通民警的工作方法和服务态度。
