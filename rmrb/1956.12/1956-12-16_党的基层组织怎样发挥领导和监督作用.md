How Can Party Grassroots Organizations Play a Leading and Supervisory Role?
Yi Qin

The new Party Constitution adopted by the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China provides more detailed regulations on the tasks and rights of Party grassroots organizations. The new Party Constitution stipulates that Party grassroots organizations in enterprises, rural areas, schools, and troops have the right to lead and supervise the work of their respective units. The Party Constitution requires all Party grassroots organizations to lead the masses to actively participate in the country's political life, carry out criticism and self-criticism, expose and eliminate shortcomings and errors in work, and struggle against all illegal and undisciplined acts, corruption, waste, and bureaucratism.

The reason why the new Party Constitution made such provisions is that, with the development of China's socialist construction, the Party has put forward higher requirements for the country's political, economic, cultural, and other work than in the past. This requires correspondingly strengthening the role of Party grassroots organizations in order to realize the Party's specific leadership over grassroots units and ensure the correct implementation of the Party's principles and policies through Party grassroots organizations. At the same time, our Party is already a ruling party, and it is even more necessary to pay attention to maintaining close ties with the masses at all times, enhance the role of Party grassroots organizations, and prevent and correct various tendencies to deviate from the masses.

To give full play to the leading and supervisory role of Party grassroots organizations, it is necessary to correct all ideas that attempt to weaken the role of Party grassroots organizations. In the past few years, whether in industrial and mining enterprises or in rural areas, many units attached importance to the work of Party grassroots organizations. Therefore, they were able to rely on Party grassroots organizations to correctly or relatively correctly implement the Party's principles and policies, complete various tasks, and maintain close ties with the masses. However, there are still many units that do not attach importance to or do not pay enough attention to the work of Party grassroots organizations. For example, after the realization of cooperation in rural areas, some people believed that "now that private ownership has been abolished, it doesn't matter whether there is branch leadership or not." This led to a phenomenon of neglecting the role of Party grassroots organizations. According to a survey by the CPC Gongzhuling Prefectural Committee in Jilin Province: in twelve agricultural cooperatives in six townships of Yushu County, Jilin Province, eleven cooperatives did not take the Party branch committee as the leading core, and all work was decided by the director of the cooperative. In some agricultural cooperatives, even opening a Party branch meeting required the "approval" of the director of the cooperative. Industrial and mining enterprises are no exception. Many major issues in work and production are not decided by the Party organization collectively, but by the administrative负责人 [fù zé rén - person in charge]; and even if they are submitted to the Party organization for discussion and decision, they cannot be passed or implemented if the administrative负责人 has different opinions. They believe that "the enterprise administrative负责人 represents the state and has the right to decide on all issues," "production tasks can be completed without the leadership of Party grassroots organizations," and "the Party's leadership is mainly reflected in the Party's political line, organizational line, and principles and policies, and grassroots organizations are only a guarantee." This idea and practice are obviously wrong.

How does the Party lead socialist construction? On the one hand, it is to formulate correct political and organizational lines, formulate correct principles and policies, and summarize the Party's successful experiences in various aspects; however, it is not enough to have only these. It is also necessary to carry out organizational work, that is, through the hard work of millions of grassroots organizations and Party members, to transform the Party's line, the Party's resolutions, and the Party's principles and policies into the actual actions of the masses inside and outside the Party, and into a material force. At the same time, before the Party formulates lines, passes resolutions, formulates principles and policies, and proposes working methods, it must also understand the opinions and requirements of the masses inside and outside the Party through Party grassroots organizations, and then concentrate these opinions and requirements to formulate lines and make resolutions. Party grassroots organizations are the political guarantee for realizing the Party's leadership. The idea and practice of acknowledging the Party's leadership but not acknowledging the leadership of Party grassroots organizations are both wrong, which can only weaken leadership and reduce the Party's leading role.

For Party grassroots organizations to truly strengthen their leading and supervisory role, they must implement the leadership system that combines collective leadership with division of labor and responsibility. In this regard, the current situation in many aspects is not satisfactory. Many Party committee secretaries and branch secretaries often do not submit major issues to the Party committee for discussion, but decide them personally, or although they are submitted to the Party committee for discussion, they cannot humbly listen to different opinions. Other members also only care about the part of the work they are responsible for and do not care about the overall work. Therefore, it is collective leadership in form, but in fact it is the secretary's personal leadership. The secretary is the core leader of the Party grassroots organization and bears more responsibility for organizing the Party's daily work. The secretary's ideological level is generally slightly higher than that of other members. However, this cannot be used to ignore the role of others or ignore the strengths of others. In fact, some people are more proficient in production and business, some are more experienced in administrative management, and others are more familiar with the Party's political and ideological work. Many problems will be solved better through collective research. Especially after the realization of advanced cooperation, practical work has raised many new and complex problems. To solve these problems, it is only possible to rely on everyone's wisdom and experience. Here, the experience of the Shuangwang Township Branch of the CPC Weinan County, Shaanxi Province can prove this. In the past, the collective leadership system of the Party organization in this township was very unsound, and everything was decided by the secretary alone. As a result, it formed a situation where "everyone looks for the secretary, and the secretary takes care of everything." Many mistakes occurred in the work, which caused great losses to both work and production. This year, with the help of the higher-level Party committee, the collective leadership system was improved, and branch committee meetings were held regularly to discuss monthly production plans and branch work plans, and to check the implementation. Before the meeting, the content of the meeting was notified to each member so that everyone could be fully prepared. At the same time, each member was assigned a clear division of labor, with each person responsible for leading one or several specific tasks. This ensures that the resolutions made by the branch committee are more comprehensive and correct. For example, when formulating the production plan for May and June of this year, in order to save time, the full-time secretary and full-time members first drafted the plan, but because they were not very familiar with agricultural production, the plan did not conform to the actual situation. For example, one of the items was "deeply hoe the cotton fields with wheat stubble," but in fact, when there is wheat stubble, it is the time to set the seedlings for the cotton, and it is impossible to deeply hoe the fields. After collective discussion, the errors in the plan were corrected.

For Party grassroots organizations to better play their leading and supervisory role, they should also adhere to and implement the working method of the mass line. The source of the Party's strength comes from the masses. Without concentrating the wisdom of the broad masses, even if the collective leadership system is sound, it is still impossible to implement correct leadership. This principle is particularly important for today's Party grassroots organizations. Now, not only do the Party organizations of many industrial and mining enterprises directly lead the production and lives of hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of workers, but also after the realization of advanced cooperation, rural areas generally establish Party grassroots organizations on the basis of cooperatives. Rural Party grassroots organizations also directly lead the production and lives of hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of farmers. Farmers hand over their land and other major means of production to the collective management of cooperatives. Whether Party grassroots organizations can lead the work of agricultural cooperatives well is directly related to the economic and cultural lives of every farmer. Therefore, farmers place all their hopes on Party grassroots organizations and are very concerned about the work of Party grassroots organizations. In the face of this situation, Party grassroots organizations should more fully realize their responsibility to the masses and use the favorable conditions of the masses' concern for the work of Party organizations to closely connect with the masses, listen to their opinions, and accept their supervision, in order to fully concentrate the wisdom of the masses and do a better job. Unfortunately, there are still many cadres of Party grassroots organizations who do not understand this principle. They mistakenly believe that "now that the masses have been organized, the work is easier, and there is no need to follow the mass line," "the property of the masses is in their own hands, so they can do whatever they want!" They often not only do not generally care about the lives of the masses, do not listen to their opinions, and act according to their own subjective intentions, but even develop a coercive and commanding style. If members have different opinions, they deduct work points, fine grain, and force the masses to obey.

Some people also believe that: we live among the masses, and we are naturally connected to the masses. How can you say that we are not following the mass line? It is true that living among the masses and following the mass line does have its advantages. However, can you say that you have connected with the masses and followed the mass line simply because you live among the masses? If you live among the masses but cannot care about their suffering, help them solve their difficulties, listen to their opinions, and concentrate their opinions and persist in them, you are also committing subjectivism and bureaucratism, which will also cause losses to the work. Obviously, living among the masses is indeed an advantage. Some people can use this condition to truly connect with the masses, while others cannot use this condition and instead use it as an excuse to detach themselves from the masses.

For Party grassroots organizations to better play their leading and supervisory role, they must also improve the business work of the Party organization itself. It cannot be denied that many leading cadres of Party grassroots organizations are relatively outstanding Communists. However, because they have not joined the Party for long, they know too little about the Party's business knowledge and often consciously or unconsciously neglect the Party's business work. When they inspect the work, they only ask about the production or other work, and rarely ask about the business work of the Party organization itself. Some of the issues discussed at the branch meetings are almost exactly the same as those discussed at the administrative meetings, neglecting the political and ideological work that the Party organization needs to pay special attention to. The Party's organizational life is unsound, and the Party's discipline is lax. Obviously, neglecting the Party's business work will inevitably weaken the Party's combat effectiveness, and it will be impossible to strengthen the Party's leading and supervisory role.

Of course, to do the above work well, in addition to the necessary efforts by the Party grassroots organizations themselves, Party committees at all levels must also quickly change their leadership style and strengthen their leadership over Party grassroots organizations. After the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, some local Party committees have begun to attach importance to the work of Party grassroots organizations and have helped them play their role; however, some Party committees still do not attach importance to this work. When they arrange or inspect the work, they often only mention the central work and rarely or rarely mention the work of the branch, regarding the work of the branch as the business of the organizational department, which has nothing to do with them. When they go to the countryside or factories to work, they only focus on the central work, do not understand the situation of the branch, do not solve the problems existing in the branch, and do not care about the development and consolidation of the branch, or regard the branch as a simple tool, only mobilizing the branch and Party members to take the lead in completing tasks, and do not help the branch, solve the difficulties in the work, and improve the awareness of Party members. If this continues for a long time, it will inevitably make the Party grassroots organizations weak politically, ideologically, and organizationally. Therefore, Party committees in various places should quickly strengthen their specific leadership over Party grassroots organizations, regularly study the work of the branch, often go deep into the branch, specifically help the branch inspect and summarize the work, exchange experiences, and cultivate the branch's ability to work independently. Only in this way can the role of Party grassroots organizations be more fully发挥 [fā huī - brought into play].

    党的基层组织怎样发挥领导和监督作用
    宜勤
    党的第八次全国代表大会所通过的新党章，对党的基层组织的任务和权利，作了比较详细的规定。新党章规定：企业、农村、学校和部队中党的基层组织有领导和监督本单位工作的权利。党章要求所有党的基层组织领导群众积极参加国家的政治生活，开展批评和自我批评，揭露和消除工作中的缺点和错误，同一切违法乱纪、贪污浪费和官僚主义的现象进行斗争。
    新党章所以要作出这样的规定，是因为随着我国社会主义建设事业的发展，党对国家的政治、经济、文化等等工作都提出了比过去更高的要求，这就必须相应地增强党的基层组织的作用，以便通过党的基层组织，实现党对基层单位的具体领导，保证正确贯彻党的方针、政策。同时，我们的党已经是一个执政的党，更加需要时时刻刻地注意保持与群众的密切联系，增强党的基层组织的作用，防止和纠正各种脱离群众的倾向。
    要充分发挥党的基层组织的领导与监督作用，必须纠正一切企图削弱党的基层组织作用的思想。在过去几年中，不论工矿企业或农村，许多单位是重视党的基层组织工作的，因此，它们就能够依靠党的基层组织正确或比较正确地贯彻执行了党的方针、政策，完成了各项任务，保持了与群众的密切联系。但是，也还有许多单位不重视或者不够重视党的基层组织的工作。比如农村实现合作化以后，就有人认为：“现在私有制取消了，有没有支部领导都可以。”所以产生了忽视党的基层组织作用的现象。据中共吉林省公主岭地委会调查：吉林省榆树县六个乡十二个农业合作社中，就有十一个社不是以党支委会为领导核心，而是一切工作都是由社主任说了算数，其中有的农业合作社连开党的支部会，也要社主任的“批准”。工矿企业也不例外，工作和生产中的许多重大问题，不是由党组织集体讨论决定，而是由行政负责人决定的；也有的虽然提交党组织讨论决定，但是，只要行政负责人有不同的意见，就通不过或行不通。他们认为：“企业行政负责人是代表国家的，对于一切问题，有决定权”，“没有党的基层组织领导一样可以完成生产任务”，“党的领导主要体现在党的政治路线、组织路线和方针、政策上，基层组织只不过是保证保证而已”。这种想法和作法显然是错误的。
    党怎样领导社会主义建设呢？一方面是制定出正确的政治路线和组织路线，制定出正确的方针、政策，总结党的各方面成功的经验；但是，仅仅有这些还是不够的，还必须要进行组织工作，这就是通过千百万个基层组织和党员的努力工作，把党的路线，党的决议，党的方针、政策，变成为党内外群众的实际行动，变成为一种物质力量。同时，党在制定路线，通过决议，制定方针、政策，提出工作方法之前，也要通过党的基层组织来了解党内外群众的意见和要求，而后集中这些意见和要求，制定路线、做出决议。党的基层组织，是实现党的领导的政治保证。承认党的领导，不承认党的基层组织的领导的想法和作法都是错误的，这只能削弱领导，降低党的领导作用。
    党的基层组织要真正能够加强它的领导与监督作用，就必须贯彻执行集体领导和分工负责相结合的领导制度，在这方面，目前有许多情况是不能令人满意的，不少党委书记和支部书记常常不把重大问题提交到党委会去讨论，而由个人决定，或者虽然提交党委会上讨论，但不能虚心听取不同的意见。其他委员也只关心自己所负责的一部分工作，不过问全面工作。因此，形式上是集体领导，实际上是书记个人领导。书记是党的基层组织的核心领导人物，在组织党的日常工作方面，负有更多的责任，书记的思想水平一般也比其他委员稍高。但是，却不能因此忽视别人的作用，忽视别人的长处。事实上，有人对于生产业务比较内行，有人对于行政管理比较有经验，还有人对于党的政治思想工作比较熟悉。许多问题经过集体研究，就会解决得更好。特别在农业合作化以后，实际工作提出了很多新的复杂的问题。要解决这些问题只有依靠大家的智慧和经验。这里有中共陕西省渭南县双王乡支部的经验可以证明。过去这个乡的党组织的集体领导制度很不健全，一切事情由书记一人决定。结果形成“人人找书记，事事书记抓”，工作中发生了不少错误，使工作、生产都受到了很大的损失。今年在上级党委帮助下健全了集体领导制度，定期召开支部委员会议，讨论每月生产计划、支部工作计划，并检查贯彻执行情况；在开会前，把会议内容通知各个委员，让大家作好充分准备。同时，各个委员又明确分工，每人负责领导一项到几项具体工作。这样，就保证了支委会作出的决议更加全面、正确。如在制定今年5、6月份生产计划时，为了争取时间，曾先由专职的书记和专职的委员拟出计划，但因他们对农业生产不很熟悉，这个计划和实际情况不大符合。如其中有一条“麦搭镰棉花深锄一遍”，实际上在麦搭镰时，棉花正是定苗的时候，根本不能深锄。经过集体讨论，纠正了计划中的错误。
    党的基层组织要能更好地发挥领导与监督作用，还应该坚持贯彻群众路线的工作方法。党的力量的源泉是来自群众，不集中广大群众的智慧，即使集体领导制度再健全，也还是不可能实行正确的领导的。这一道理，对于今天党的基层组织来说，显得格外重要。现在，不仅是许多工矿企业的党组织，直接领导着成百成千以至成万工人的生产和生活，而且在实现高级合作化以后，农村一般都是以社为单位建立党的基层组织，农村党的基层组织同样直接领导着成百成千以至成万农民的生产和生活。农民把土地和其他主要生产资料都交给合作社集体经营，党的基层组织能不能领导好农业合作社的工作，直接关系到每个农民的经济生活、文化生活；因此，农民把一切希望寄托于党的基层组织，十分关怀党的基层组织的工作。面对这种情况，党的基层组织就应该更加充分地认识到自己对群众应负的责任，并利用群众关怀党组织工作的有利条件，密切联系群众，倾听群众意见，接受群众的监督，以便充分集中群众的智慧，把工作做得更好。可惜现在仍有许多党的基层组织的干部不懂得这个道理，他们错误地认为：“现在群众已经组织起来了，工作好做了，不用走群众路线了”、“群众的财产掌握在自己手里，爱怎么办就怎么办吧！”他们往往不仅是一般地不关心群众生活，不倾听群众的意见，凭自己的主观意图办事，甚至发展了强迫命令作风，如果社员有不同意见，就扣工分，罚粮食，强迫群众服从。
    还有人认为：我们生活在群众当中，天生就是联系群众的，怎么说是不走群众路线呢？不错，生活在群众当中，走群众路线，确实有它方便之处，但是仅仅生活在群众当中，难道就能说已经联系群众、走群众路线了吗？如果你是生活在群众当中，不能关心群众疾苦，帮助群众解决困难，倾听群众的意见，并把群众的意见集中上来，坚持下去，同样是犯了主观主义和官僚主义，同样会使工作受到损失。显然，生活在群众当中，确实是个有利条件，有些人能够运用这个条件，就能真正密切联系群众，有些人不能利用这个条件，不仅不能联系群众，反而以此为借口，脱离了群众。
    党的基层组织要能更好地发挥领导和监督作用，还要改进党组织本身的业务工作。不能否认，许多党的基层组织的领导干部都是比较优秀的共产党员，但是，由于他们入党不久，对于党的业务知识懂得太少，常常自觉地或者不自觉地忽视了党的业务工作。他们在检查工作的时候，只问生产或其它工作的情况如何，很少过问党组织本身的业务工作；有些支部大会讨论的问题，也几乎同行政会议讨论的问题一模一样，忽视了党组织所特别需要注意的政治思想工作。党的组织生活不健全，党的纪律松弛。显然，忽视党的业务工作的结果，就必然削弱了党的战斗力，也就谈不上能够加强党的领导和监督作用了。
    当然，要能做好以上工作，除党的基层组织本身做必要的努力外，还必须各级党委迅速改变领导作风，加强对党的基层组织的领导。党的八次代表大会以后，有些地方党委已经开始重视党的基层组织的工作，并且帮助他们发挥了作用；但是，也有些党委至今仍然不重视这一工作，他们在布置或检查工作时，往往只提中心工作，不提或少提支部工作，把支部工作看成是组织部门的事，和自己无关，在下乡或下厂工作的时候，也是只抓中心工作，对支部的情况不去了解，对支部中存在的问题不去解决，对支部的发展和巩固不去关心，或者把支部看成是单纯的工具，只去动员支部和党员带头完成任务，不去帮助支部，解决工作中的困难和提高党员觉悟。这样长期下去，就必不可免地使党的基层组织从政治上、思想上、组织上软弱下去。所以各地党委应当迅速加强对党的基层组织的具体领导，定期研究支部工作，经常深入支部，具体帮助支部检查总结工作，交流经验，培养支部独立工作的能力。只有这样，党的基层组织的作用才能更加充分地发挥起来。
