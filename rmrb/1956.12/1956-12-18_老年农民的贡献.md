Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 16th: When cadres of the Hengyi Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, introduced the increased production and income situation this year, they particularly praised the many contributions of the elderly farmers in the cooperative.

　　This spring, the cooperative's cadres subjectively pursued high yields and determined to increase the double-cropping rice planting area of the entire cooperative from 52 mu last year to 1,044 mu, with an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu. After the cooperative cadres announced this plan, they expected the members to follow it, but unexpectedly, the production teams were unable to undertake the contracted production. Some members doubted whether this would result in a harvest. Therefore, the cooperative convened a meeting of elderly farmers. The elderly farmers affirmed that double-cropping rice could indeed increase production, but various conditions had to be coordinated. Elderly farmer Fu Zhiqian said, "During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I once planted 1.7 mu of double-cropping rice. The early rice yielded 450 jin per mu, but the late rice was planted after missing the season, resulting in no harvest." The elderly farmers pointed out that to master the production season, there must be sufficient labor. After detailed calculations, there was still a shortage of 5,000 laborers to plant 1,044 mu of double-cropping rice in the entire cooperative. At the same time, planting more double-cropping rice would inevitably destroy some of the wheat and broad beans that were not yet ripe. This meeting gave the cooperative cadres great inspiration and education. Later, after discussion by the members of the cooperative, the double-cropping rice planting area was realistically reduced, and a bumper harvest was achieved this year.

　　This cooperative was hit by a strong typhoon in August this year, which collapsed a pond dam, and 489 mu of early rice nearby was flooded. After the water receded, the cooperative cadres immediately mobilized the members to plant late rice. However, many members worried that there would be no harvest because the season had passed. For this matter, the cooperative cadres convened another meeting of elderly farmers. Old farmer Fu Nisheng, who is 83 years old, suggested that the late rice should be hoed twice in the six days after planting, and then lime should be applied to promote the development and growth of the rice seedlings. After the cooperative did this, these late rice still yielded an average of about 200 jin per mu.

    老年农民的贡献
    新华社杭州16日电　浙江萧山县横一农业社干部在介绍今年增加生产增加收入情况的时候，特别夸奖了社里老年农民的许多贡献。
    今年春天，这个社干部曾经主观地追求高额丰产，确定全社双季连作稻种植面积从去年的五十二亩增加到一千零四十四亩，每亩平均要产一千斤。社干部把这个计划宣布以后，满以为社员们会照着办的，却不料各生产队包工包产都包不下去。有些社员怀疑这样做能不能收到粮食。于是社里召集老年农民开了一次会。老年农民肯定双季连作稻确实能增产，但是要有各种条件配合。老年农民傅芝铨说：“我在抗日战争那一年，曾经种过一亩七分连作稻，早稻每亩收四百五十斤，晚稻因为错过了季节才种下去，结果颗粒无收。”老年农民们指出，要掌握好生产季节，必须有足够的劳动力。经过详细计算，全社种一千零四十四亩双季连作稻，还缺少五千个劳动力。同时连作稻种多了就不得不毁掉一部分当时尚未成熟的小麦和蚕豆。这次会议给了社干部很大的启发和教育。后来社里经过社员讨论，实事求是地把双季连作稻种植面积改小，今年才获得空前丰收。
    这个社今年8月受到强台风侵袭，吹塌了一处塘坝，附近有四百八十九亩早稻被淹。水退后，社干部立即发动社员种上了晚稻。可是不少社员担心不会有什么收成，因为季节已经过去了。社干部为了这件事，又召开了一次老年农民会议。年已八十三岁的老农民傅倪生建议，要在晚稻种下以后的六天中耘趟两次，再以后增施石灰，以促进稻苗发育成长。社里照这个办法做了以后，这些晚稻平均每亩仍然收了约两百斤。
