Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 5th: Egyptian newspapers on the 4th prominently published the news of the British and French announcement of troop withdrawal. The newspapers emphasized that the withdrawal of British and French troops should be regarded as a great victory for Egypt and all freedom-loving people who support Egypt's resistance against the aggressors.

　　"Al Akhbar" said, "The shame of Britain and France will not be easily removed. This shame should be a punitive punishment for them."

　　Cairo Radio said on the evening of the 3rd that the British and French decision to withdraw their troops must be implemented "quickly and unconditionally." Cairo Radio warned:
    “This is not the end of the problem, but only the beginning of the period of settling all the problems arising from the British, French, and Israeli aggression."
    Cairo Radio said: "Egypt will not agree to negotiations on the Middle East issue or begin cleaning up the canal until the withdrawal is complete."
    The radio said that Egypt declared that "it will remain the sole owner of the Suez Canal and will continue to exercise full sovereignty over the canal in managing the canal and ensuring freedom of navigation."
    Syrian Ambassador to Egypt, Azam, said: "Such a decision was expected after the world condemned this aggression and the majority of people in various countries opposed this aggression. We hope that the result of this aggression will make any country that intends to invade think carefully."

　　Jordanian Ambassador to Egypt, Fazi Mulki, said: "This is an unprecedented victory not only from the Arab point of view, but also from the international scope."

　　Yemeni Minister Abu Taleb said: "This fully proves the importance of world opinion. We hope this will be a serious lesson for Britain, France, and Israel... This should also be a good lesson for the Arab countries, making them realize that they can only gain a proper position in the world if they are united."

Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: Egyptian newspapers, in commenting on the news of the British and French announcement of their withdrawal from Egypt, called on the people not to relax their vigilance and to continue to be ready at all times to repel any possible provocations by the imperialists.

　　Anwar Sadat wrote in "Al-Gomhuria" that the withdrawal of the aggressor troops from Egyptian territory does not mean that there is no aggression. He said that the failure of the aggression against Egypt had shattered their plans, but the imperialists did not give up their plundering intentions, and the withdrawal of troops from Port Said alone did not eliminate the imperialist threat over the people of Arab countries.

　　An article published in "Al Shaab" pointed out that the Egyptian people have the right to demand punishment for those who have caused them disaster and suffering, and those who have committed heinous crimes in Port Said and other parts of Egypt.

　　Fahmy, editor-in-chief of "Al Shaab," wrote that the withdrawal of the aggressor troops from Egypt does not mean the end of the struggle against imperialism and for freedom and independence.

　　"Al Shaab" also said: The withdrawal of troops from Egypt does not end this battle. This battle will only end when imperialism is eliminated in the Arab world and Britain and France recognize Arab independence and sovereignty.

    埃及舆论和阿拉伯国家使节指出
　　英法宣布撤军是埃及的巨大胜利
  　埃报号召人民不要放松警惕，时刻准备迎击侵略者的挑衅
    据新华社5日讯　开罗消息：埃及报纸4日用显著地位刊载了英法宣布撤军的消息。报纸强调指出，英法军队的撤退应该被认为是埃及同支持埃及反抗侵略者的一切爱好自由的人民的巨大胜利。
      “消息报”说，“英法的羞耻将是不容易去掉的。这种羞耻应该是对它们的惩戒性的处罚。”
    开罗电台3日晚说，英法宣布撤军的决定必须“迅速地、无条件地”加以执行。开罗电台警告说：
  “这并不是问题的结束，而只是清算由于英法和以色列侵略所产生的一切问题的时期的开始。”
    开罗电台说：“在撤退完成以前，埃及不会同意对中东问题进行谈判，也不会开始清理运河的工作。”
    电台说，埃及声明，“它将仍然是苏伊士运河的唯一主人，并且在管理运河和保证通航自由方面继续对运河行使着完全的主权。”
    叙利亚驻埃及大使阿扎姆说：
  “在全世界谴责这种侵略、世界各国的大多数人民反对这种侵略以后，作出这样的决定本是意料中的事。我们希望，这种侵略的结果将使任何打算侵略的国家仔细想一想。”
    约旦驻埃及大使法齐·穆尔基说：“不仅从阿拉伯观点看，而且从国际范围来看，这都是一个空前的胜利。”
    也门公使阿布塔莱布说：“这充分证明世界舆论的重要性。我们希望这对英、法、以色列三国是一个严重的教训……这对阿拉伯国家也应当是一个良好的教训，使它们认识，它们只有团结一致，才能在世界上得到适当的地位。”
    据新华社5日讯　埃及报纸在评论英法宣布要从埃及撤军的消息时，号召人民不要放松警惕，要继续时刻准备迎击帝国主义者任何可能的挑衅。
    安瓦尔·萨达特在“共和国报”上写道，侵略军撤出埃及领土并不意味着没有侵略了。他说，侵略埃及的失败打破了他们的计划，但是帝国主义者并不放弃他们的掠夺意图，单是从塞得港撤出军队并没有消除阿拉伯国家人民头上的帝国主义威胁。
      “人民报”刊载的一篇文章中指出，埃及人民有权利要求惩罚那些使他们遭到灾难和痛苦的人、那些在塞得港和在埃及其他地区犯了令人发指的罪行的人。
      “人民报”总编辑法米写道，侵略军撤出埃及并不意味着反对帝国主义、争取自由和独立的斗争的结束。
      “人民报”还说：从埃及撤军并没有结束这场战斗。只有在把帝国主义在阿拉伯世界消灭了和英法承认了阿拉伯的独立和主权的时候，这场战斗才算结束。
