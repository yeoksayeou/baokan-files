Why "Relief" Oneself First

    The Sanhe Township People's Committee in Dingyuan County, Anhui Province, recently received a batch of clothing for disaster relief, including twill fabric clothes and felt hats, all in relatively new styles. At the time, I thought: the disaster victims must be especially happy to receive these things. Who knew that the next day, some cadres of the Township People's Committee, and people related to them, would pick out the best clothes and hats from among them, and first "relieve" themselves. As to why they did this, they alone can answer! Sizhong

　　为什么首先“救济”自己
    安徽省定远县三和镇乡人民委员会，最近收到了一批救济灾民的衣物，其中有斜纹布的衣服，也有呢制的帽子，样式都比较新颖。当时我想：灾民们收到这些东西以后，心里一定格外高兴。谁知到了第二天，乡人民委员会的一些干部，以及和他们有关系的人员，却把其中好的衣帽挑选出来，首先来“救济”自己了。究竟为什么要这样做，只有请他们自己来回答了！　四仲
