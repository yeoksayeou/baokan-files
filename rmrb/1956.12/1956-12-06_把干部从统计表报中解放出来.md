　　Liberate Cadres from Statistical Reports
　　Zhang Shichun
　　Recently, the Pingtan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fujian Province convened a meeting of district committee office personnel. Everyone reflected that the work of the district committee was both numerous and chaotic, with constant phone calls and endless statistical reports to fill out. They unanimously requested that the county committee provide practical assistance in resolving this issue, enabling them to be liberated from telephones and reports, and to have more time to go deeper and solve practical problems in their work.
　　Why is this phenomenon happening? On the one hand, this is certainly due to the increasingly detailed division of labor and the establishment of many new institutions at the county level, along with the increasing development of socialist construction and socialist transformation, while the district committee still has only one office; but more importantly, the work at the county level lacks planning, and many county-level agencies only consider their own convenience, rarely taking into account the difficulties of district and township cadres. According to the comrades present at the meeting, the following phenomena generally exist in various districts of Pingtan County: First, the county's leading organs are accustomed to requesting materials from the district committee by telephone, which forces the district committee to designate a person specifically to answer the phone. Moreover, because materials and figures are always needed so urgently, requiring them to be reported within one or two days or even a few hours, the district committee office sometimes has to close its doors and mobilize all cadres to go to the villages to collect materials, even pulling in the district committee secretary and other leading cadres of the district to collect materials together. Often, not only are the district cadres extremely busy, but the township and cooperative cadres are also sweating profusely. Second, the district committee is required to provide information on everything, big or small. A comrade from the district committee office calculated that not only the departments of the county committee and the sections of the county people's committee, but also two or thirty units such as the bank, supply and marketing cooperative, grain bureau, tax bureau, aquatic products supply and marketing company, oil company, and food company are asking them for materials and assigning tasks. Among the situations investigated and understood by these units, many are certainly important issues that require the opinions of the district committee, but there are also many that can be decided by the economic and business organs themselves. For example, the food company also calls the district committee to ask about the issue of farmers slaughtering pigs. Moreover, some county-level agencies, after being refused by the district committee office personnel for asking about some trivial matters, tirelessly go to ask the district committee secretary, causing the district committee secretary to be frequently held up by telephone calls and some trivial matters, preventing him from going to the villages. Third, some situations and materials could have been resolved as long as the county's leading organs contacted each other, but some agencies still want to ask the lower levels for them. Therefore, the district committee has to report the same issue to this agency and also to that agency. This not only wastes paper and ink, but also increases the burden on cadres. And some agencies in the county, for the reports and instructions issued for the same issue, in addition to directly notifying their subordinates, also call the district committee or print them into documents and send them to the district committee, even though they are not very related to the work of the district committee. This is also a reason for the increase in telephone calls and the inability to process documents in the district.
　　The comrades present at the meeting urgently requested to change this situation. They hoped that offices in the county with similar work natures should be appropriately merged to achieve unified arrangements for work and investigation and understanding of situations; the materials requested from the district committee by various departments, especially numerical materials, should be simplified as much as possible, and the district should be given more ample time to collect and organize materials; situations that can be understood and materials that can be obtained at the county level should not be requested from the district committee, especially in units where the district has dispatched agencies, they should not request materials or assign tasks to the district committee. Only in this way can the burden on district-level agencies be reduced, enabling them to have more time to consider the central work, and be able to send more cadres to the townships and cooperatives to specifically help the township and cooperative cadres solve problems in their work.
　　The district cadres' request is reasonable. The Pingtan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Pingtan County People's Committee have accepted their opinions and are working to improve their own work. However, we believe that this problem cannot be solved by the county alone, and we hope that the party and government leading organs of the province and the special district can also help solve this problem.

　　把干部从统计表报中解放出来
　　张诗椿
    最近，中共福建省平潭县委会召开了一次区委办公室人员的会议，大家一致反映区委的工作既多又乱，每天的电话来往不绝，统计表报填写不完。他们一致要求县委会切实地帮助解决这个问题，使他们能够从电话和表报中解放出来，有更多的时间深入下去解决工作中的实际问题。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？这一方面固然是由于随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造工作的日益发展，县里的工作分工越来越细，增设了许多新的机构，而区委仍然只有一个办公室；但是更重要的还是县里的工作缺乏计划性，特别是许多县级机关只图自己的方便，很少为区乡干部的困难着想。据到会的同志反映，平潭县各区普遍地存在着这样几种现象：第一，县的领导机关习惯于用电话向区委要材料，这样区委就不得不专门设一个人来接电话。而且由于材料和数字总是要得那末急，限定一两天甚至几个钟点之内就要报到，所以有时区委办公室就只好关上门，调动所有干部下乡搜集材料，甚至拉上区委书记和区的其他领导干部一起来搜集材料。经常是不但区干部忙得不可开交，连乡、社干部也跟着忙得满头大汗。第二，不管大事小事，都要区委供给情况。有个区委办公室的同志计算了一下，向他们要材料和布置工作的，不仅有县委各部和县人民委员会的各科，还有银行、供销社、粮食局、税务局、水产供销公司、油脂公司、食品公司等二三十个单位。在这些单位调查了解的情况中，固然有许多是重要的问题，需要听听区委的意见，但也有许多是经济和事业机关自己就能够决定的。例如，农民宰猪的问题，食品公司也要打电话问区委。而且有些县级机关因为问一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事，遭到区委办公室人员的拒绝以后，又不厌其烦地去问区委书记，使区委书记经常被电话和一些琐屑事务拖住而下不了乡。第三，有些情况和材料，本来只要县的领导机关互相联系一下，就能够解决的，但是有些机关仍然要问下面要。因此，同样一个问题，区委既要向这个机关汇报，也要向那个机关汇报。这就不但浪费了纸张和油墨，而且加重了干部的负担。而县里有些机关为同一问题发出的报告和指示，除了直接通知他们的下级以外，虽然和区委的工作关系不大，也要打电话通知区委，或者印成文件送给区委。这也是区里电话增多和文件处理不完的一个原因。
    到会的同志迫切要求改变这种现状，他们希望凡是县里工作性质相近的办公室应适当合并，作到统一布置工作和调查了解情况；各部门向区委要的材料、特别是数字材料要尽量简化，并且要给区里比较充裕的搜集整理材料的时间；凡是在县里能够了解到的情况和要到的材料不应向区委要，特别是在区里有派出机构的单位，更不应向区委要材料和布置工作。只有这样，才能减轻区级机关的负担，使他们有更多的时间考虑中心工作，能够抽出更多的干部下到乡、社，具体地帮助乡、社干部解决工作中的问题。
    区干部的这个要求是合理的，中共平潭县委和平潭县人民委员会已经接受了他们的意见，正在着手改进本身的工作。但是，我们认为，这个问题不是县里能够单独解决的，希望省和专区的党政领导机关也能帮助解决这个问题。
