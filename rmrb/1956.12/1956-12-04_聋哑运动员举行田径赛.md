Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 3rd. Shanghai's deaf and mute individuals participated in a large-scale track and field meet for the first time.

    This meet was held on the 2nd at the Shanghai Fengyu Stadium. Track and field referees and starters used flags instead of verbal commands and starting gun to give signals. Although there were no verbal commands or shouts of "add oil" on the field, the twenty-three events proceeded very intensely and smoothly. Wu Qianyou, a young teacher from Shanghai No. 4 Deaf-Mute School, won first place in the long jump, high jump, and 100-meter sprint. His long jump and high jump results both reached the national third-level athlete standard.

    More than two hundred and twenty athletes participated in this track and field meet, most of whom were students from deaf-mute schools, with some being workers and social youth.
