    Premier Zhou's Speech at the Airport When Leaving Calcutta
    Dear friends!
    After a pleasant and friendly twelve-day visit to your country, my colleagues and I are leaving today. At this moment of parting, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Indian Government and people. We should especially thank His Excellency President Prasad and His Excellency Prime Minister Nehru, whose care and guidance have made our visit so successful. We also thank the Indian Government and the Governors, Chief Ministers, officials and staff of all levels of government, and the Indian civil aviation personnel in the states we visited for their valuable care and assistance during the visit. For twelve days, we have been warmly received and grandly welcomed by the Indian government and people wherever we went. This is a great honor for us and for the Chinese people.
    Our visit is to enhance Sino-Indian friendship. From our extensive contacts with all parties in India, we can happily say that the flower of Sino-Indian friendship not only has a glorious past, but also a more brilliant future. We believe that our visit will promote the friendly and cooperative relations between China and India.
    Dear friends, thank you again. Let us work together to further strengthen Sino-Indian friendly cooperation. The friendly cooperation between 400 million Indian people and 600 million Chinese people will be a major factor in consolidating the unity of Asian and African countries and maintaining world peace. Although we are temporarily separated, our friendly hearts are always close.
    Long live Sino-Indian friendship!
    Long live the great unity of the Asian and African peoples!
    Long live world peace!
    Panchsheel - Zindabad!
    Hindi Chini bhai bhai!

    离开加尔各答的时候
    周总理在飞机场上的讲话亲爱的朋友们！
    我和我的同事们在贵国进行了十二天愉快的友好访问之后，今天就要离开了。在这个分手的时候，请允许我代表中国政府和人民向印度政府和人民表示衷心的谢意。我们应该特别感谢普拉沙德总统阁下和尼赫鲁总理阁下，由于他们的关怀和指导，我们的访问才能得到这样满意的结果。我们还要感谢印度政府和我们到过的各邦的邦长，首席部长，各级政府的官员和工作人员，以及印度民用航空人员在访问中给予我们的可贵的照料和帮助。十二天来，我们所到之处都受到印度政府和人民的殷勤招待和盛大欢迎。这是对我们，也是对中国人民的很大光荣。
    我们的访问是为了增进中印友谊。从我们在印度同各方面的广泛接触来看，我们可以很高兴地说中印友谊的花朵不仅有着光辉的过去，而且有着更加灿烂的将来。我们相信，我们这次的访问在中印友好合作关系上是能够起着推进作用的。
    亲爱的朋友们，再一次感谢你们。让我们为进一步加强中印友好合作关系而努力。四万万印度人民和六万万中国人民的友好合作，将是巩固亚非各国团结和维护世界和平的重大因素。我们虽然暂时分别了，但是，我们友好的心永远是靠近的。
    中印友好万岁！
    亚非人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    潘查希拉——秦达巴！
    印地秦尼巴依巴依！
