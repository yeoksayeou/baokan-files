Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 10th: According to Vietnam News Agency on December 9th: The Deputy Minister of the Interior of Vietnam, Phạm Văn Bạch, recently, when receiving Czechoslovak News Agency’s Hanoi correspondent, Irina Dhumasova, explained the truth about the Quỳnh Lưu unrest and the measures taken by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to resolve this issue.

Phạm Văn Bạch said that an incident had occurred in Quỳnh Lưu district, but this incident ended in a complete failure.

Saigon Radio admitted on November 18, 1956, that these riots were caused by "an organization that had been secretly preparing there." It has been verified that the ringleaders arrested in Quỳnh An commune, Quỳnh Lưu district, were agents who had previously forced the people of this area to go to the South. Under the guise of protecting religion, they attempted to make the Catholic residents of certain communes in Quỳnh Lưu district disregard the positive achievements of land reform. However, because they extorted rice, grain, and money from the peasants and spread terror among honest residents, they exposed their true colors. They responded to the patient explanations of local authorities with insults and violence. Eventually, the Catholic residents of this area completely disagreed with the actions of these saboteurs.

Phạm Văn Bạch said that after the incident occurred, the local government immediately dispatched a delegation to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and condemned the conspiracy of the reactionaries who had seriously harmed the interests of the residents. At the same time, measures were taken to ensure public order and security so that residents could resume their daily work.

The unrest lasted only three days. As early as November 15, 1956, the situation had completely returned to normal, the farmers were able to start harvesting in time, and our Catholic compatriots were attending church as usual.

In response to the question of what was the purpose of Ngô Đình Diệm's letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Phạm Văn Bạch said that the Saigon authorities, together with their American masters, have been carrying out a campaign of spreading lies and slander on this issue. They are trying to deceive public opinion by fabricating so-called "popular uprisings" through loud, well-timed propaganda. We all know clearly that the enemies of the peace and socialist camp are currently attempting to carry out sabotage and are carrying out subversion activities in people's democratic countries through their agents. The Southern authorities are fervently conducting the "movement to support the insurgents in the North" in accordance with this policy. Obviously, while systematically undermining the Geneva Accords, stepping up the expansion of the South Vietnamese armed forces, and constantly violating the demilitarized zone, the American-Ngô clique wants to achieve the same goal: to disrupt our peaceful construction work in North Vietnam and hinder the reunification of Vietnam. The Southern authorities are also clearly trying to divert public opinion from the repression and terror they are carrying out in South Vietnam. The Southern authorities' request to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to pay attention to the so-called "Quỳnh Lưu incident" - a purely internal affair - is both illegal and absurd.

Phạm Văn Bạch emphasized that despite the various conspiracies of Ngô Đình Diệm, we are continuing to consolidate the people's democratic regime in the North, and sooner or later we will certainly be able to achieve the reunification of our motherland.

    越南内务部副部长答捷通讯社记者问
    说明琼流事件真相和政府措施
    指责南越当局借此大叫大嚷欺骗舆论
    新华社河内10日电　据越南通讯社9日讯：越南内务部副部长范文白最近在接见捷克斯洛伐克通讯社驻河内记者伊里纳·杜马索瓦的时候，说明了关于琼流骚乱的真相以及越南民主共和国政府为解决这个问题所采取的措施。
    范文白说，琼流县曾经发生了一次事变，但是这次事变最后遭到惨败。
    西贡电台在1956年11月18日承认：这些骚乱是“一个曾经在那里秘密进行准备的组织”引起的。已经查明，在琼流县琼安乡逮捕到的头子们是先前强迫这个地区的人民到南方去的特务。他们打着保护宗教的幌子，企图使琼流县某些乡的天主教居民无视土地改革的积极成就。但是，由于他们向农民勒索稻米、粮食和钱财，并且在老实的居民中散布恐怖，他们就暴露了自己的真面目。他们以凌辱和暴力行为来回答地方当局代表的耐心解释。最后这个地区的天主教居民完全不同意这些破坏分子的行为。
    范文白说，事情发生以后，地方政府立刻派遣一个代表团进行实地调查，谴责严重地损害了居民的利益的反动分子的阴谋。同时，还采取了措施以确保公共秩序和治安，使居民能够恢复日常工作。
    骚乱只继续了三天。早在1956年11月15日，情况已经完全恢复正常，农民们能够及时开始收割，我们的天主教同胞又照常上教堂了。
    在回答关于吴庭艳写信给联合国秘书长的目的何在这个问题时，范文白说，西贡当局同它的美国主子一起，一直在就这个问题进行一个散布谎言和大事诽谤的运动。他们企图通过大叫大嚷的、选择好时机的宣传，捏造所谓“人民起义”来欺骗舆论。我们都清楚知道，目前和平和社会主义阵营的敌人正在企图进行破坏活动，并且正在通过他们的特务在人民民主国家进行颠覆活动。南方当局就是按照这个方针狂热地进行“支持北方起义者的运动”的。显然，在有计划地破坏日内瓦协议、加紧扩充南越武装部队和经常侵犯非军事区的时候，美吴集团是想达到同一目标：扰乱我们越南北方的和平建设工作，阻挠越南的统一。南方当局显然也在力图分散舆论对它在南越进行的镇压和恐怖活动的注意。南方当局要求联合国秘书长注意所谓“琼流事件”——一个纯粹的内政问题，这种做法是既非法而又荒谬。
    范文白强调说，尽管吴庭艳施展种种阴谋，我们正在继续巩固北方的人民民主政权，我们迟早一定能够实现祖国的重新统一。
