    Zhejiang Provincial Salt Bureau, Tianjin Municipal Tax Bureau
    Frugality Becomes a Habit, Year After Year
    From Top to Bottom, Consistent Hard Work and Simplicity, Administrative Expenses Have Annual Surplus
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to the Zhejiang Daily: The staff of the Zhejiang Provincial Salt Bureau, led by the responsible comrades of the agency, have maintained a fine tradition of hard work and simplicity for several years.
    Since the "Three-Anti" movement, the Party Leadership Group of the Zhejiang Salt Bureau of the Communist Party of China has often used the beneficial lessons of the "Three-Anti" movement and the Party's tradition of hard work and simplicity to educate Party members and all staff. In particular, the exemplary role of leading personnel in setting an example has had a good influence on the thinking of comrades. Taking the living conditions of the four bureau directors as an example, they, like other comrades in the bureau, live in a renovated ancestral hall. All four of them live downstairs. Because the quality of the house is poor, dust leaks from the ceiling cracks when people move around upstairs. The office once planned to whitewash all these rooms. After Deputy Director Luo Yiwen found out about this, he considered that the painting fee for each room would be 100 yuan, which would total 1,800 yuan. He disagreed with this method, thinking it was too expensive. After seeking the opinions of the other directors, everyone decided to buy some bamboo mats and nail them to the floorboards. This saved the state a sum of money. The directors are very careful to save gasoline, and they rarely use public cars for personal activities.
    Because leading cadres pay attention to thrift, other comrades also pay attention to thrift. For example, in the more than seven years since liberation, almost all the main office supplies for the Salt Bureau's more than 100 people were taken over at the time of liberation. Over time, it is inevitable that the paint on the desks and chairs will peel off, crack, and the legs break. At this time, although a few people suggested replacing the old with new ones, the relevant departments always explained the significance of thrift on the one hand, and found someone to repair and paint them on the other, unwilling to discard them easily. Some departments often repair office furniture themselves. The more than 20 bicycles in the agency are also from seven or eight years ago. Although they look very old, they are very light to use. It turns out that these cars are automatically repaired by the car driver Tu Baiqing. Last year alone, he saved the country 411 yuan in bicycle repair costs. Over the years, except for important official business that requires neat envelopes and stationery, the envelopes and stationery used for general correspondence are all made from waste paper. In particular, the comrades in the communications and civil service departments start making envelopes as soon as they sit down. They said, "We have been engaged in this kind of sideline for several years, and we are used to it." Notebooks and commonly used statistical forms are also mostly made by comrades from waste paper. Although the raw materials are paper that has been used once, the binding and printing are very unique. If anyone is careless about public property, it is difficult not to be criticized by others in this agency. For example, dropping a few pins on the ground seems like a small matter, but the civil servant comrades always pick them up one by one when sweeping the floor. After doing this many times, he will definitely write this phenomenon into an article and post it on the blackboard newspaper. In the beginning, some people felt awkward about this approach. Now, everyone thinks that mutual supervision is a matter of course. Yin Furen, deputy director of the office, said: "Based on the principle of using what is necessary and trying not to use what can be used or not used, our administrative expenses have had annual surpluses to hand over in the past few years. This is inseparable from the hard work and simplicity of our comrades."
    The offices and dormitories of the Salt Bureau are very old. In order to improve the environment, all the staff of the Salt Bureau often roll up their sleeves to participate in general cleaning. Walking into the gate of the Salt Bureau, what you see are mostly ancient wooden pillars, doors, windows, and old tables, chairs, cabinets, boxes, etc. However, after the diligent owners constantly tidy up and wash them, they all look neat and clean. Since 1954, they have continuously won the honorary title of First-Class Advanced Unit in Hygiene for Hangzhou Municipal Agencies. In August of this year, when a typhoon passed through, several houses were blown down. The comrades of the Salt Bureau cleaned up the damaged houses and furniture themselves, and also turned the cleared waste materials into money and handed them over to the state treasury. Seeing this situation, the Bureau of Government Affairs, based on the principle of necessity, took the initiative to allocate funds to build a two-story office building for the Salt Bureau.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 17th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Jun) The Tianjin Municipal Tax Bureau is one of the agencies in the city with the lowest administrative expenses. One morning, I made a special trip to visit this bureau.
    I first visited the General Affairs Section. Wei Shilan, the deputy section chief, told me that from January to the end of November this year, the administrative expenses of the entire bureau and its affiliated system had already saved more than 32,100 yuan. In the past three years, there has been an annual surplus in administrative expenses. In 1954, the surplus was more than 55,000 yuan, and in 1955, the surplus was more than 62,000 yuan. He said that their agency has always paid attention to implementing the spirit of "generally not spending what can be spent or not spent." All furniture worth more than ten yuan and usable for more than one year in the municipal bureau and the nine district sub-bureaus are registered in the accounts and can be adjusted for use at any time according to surplus or shortage. In addition, the number of personnel in the tax bureau has not increased. Therefore, the entire bureau has not spent a single penny on purchase expenses last year and this year.
    The deputy section chief believed that thrift has become a conscious matter for all staff members in their agency, so he led me to visit their various places. First, we came to the Document and Archives Section. The mimeograph operator Chen Guoliang was printing forms. After printing each stencil, instead of throwing it away or burning it as many mimeograph operators usually do, he carefully used a knife to scrape off a lot of the ink stuck on the waste stencil for reuse. Chen Guoliang said that because he does this, each box of ink can print 7,000 to 8,000 more documents or forms.
    The bureau has a director and two deputy directors. According to the regulations of the Municipal People's Committee, they can have two cars, but they only share one. According to the driver Wei Enke, the directors only use the car when going to meetings or working in distant places. Usually, they ride bicycles to and from work.
    In order to understand why this bureau can be so simple and thrifty, I finally visited the director, Li Wenquan. He said that their agency is an agency that manages finances for the country. Tax officials generally know that the income of the people and the country does not come easily. Since the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in 1952, they have conducted an inspection and education on opposing corruption and waste and promoting increased production and thrift every year. Last year, all cadres jointly formulated a code of conduct for tax officials, stipulating that every tax official should consciously cherish public property, oppose extravagance and waste and hedonistic ideas, and promote the fine traditions of hard work and simplicity, integrity, and devotion to public service. He modestly said that their thrift achievements are not very great. They are currently implementing the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and are conducting another education on hard work and simplicity among the cadres of the entire bureau.

    浙江省盐务局　天津市税务局
    节俭成风气　数年如一日
    从上到下一贯艰苦朴素，行政费用年年都有节余
    本报讯　据浙江日报报道：浙江省盐务局的工作人员，在机关负责同志带动下，数年来一直保持着艰苦朴素的优良作风。
    自从“三反”运动以后，中共浙江盐务局党组经常用“三反”中有益的教训和党的艰苦朴素传统来教育党员和全体工作人员。特别是领导人员以身作则的模范作用，在同志们的思想中产生了很好的影响。以四位局长的生活情况来说，他们和局里其他同志一样，也是住在经过改造的一座祠堂里。他们四人都住在楼下，因为房子质量差，楼上的人一活动，灰尘就从天花板缝里漏下来。办公室曾计划把这些房间都粉刷一遍。事情被副局长罗义文知道之后，他考虑到：每个房间的粉刷费照一百元计算，合起来就是一千八百元。他不同意这个办法，嫌花钱太多了。经过征求另几位局长的意见，大家决定买一些竹席钉在楼板上。这就替国家节省了一笔开支。局长们都很注意节约汽油，凡是一些私人活动，他们很少使用公家的汽车。
    由于领导干部注意节约，其他同志也就都注意节约。比方说，解放七年多来，盐务局一百多人的主要办公用具，几乎全是解放时接收下来的。时间长了，桌椅油漆脱落、裂面、断腿现象总是难免发生。这时，虽有个别人提出以旧换新的意见，但有关部门总是一面说明节约的意义，一面找人进行修补、油漆，不肯轻易丢掉。有些科室经常自己动手修理办公家具。机关里二十多辆脚踏车也都是七、八年以前的，看起来虽很破旧，用起来却都很轻便，原来这些车子都是由汽车驾驶员屠柏青自动负责进行修理的。去年一年，他一个人就为国家节省了脚踏车修理费四百十一元。几年来，他们除重要的公事用个整齐的信封信纸以外，一般来往信件，所用的信封信纸全是自己用废纸做起来的。特别是传达和公务员同志，当他们坐下来的时候，就顺手做起信封来。他们说：“搞这种副业已好几年了，习惯了。”记录本和普通用的统计表格，也多是同志们用废纸制成的。原料虽是用过一次的纸张，但装钉和印刷却很别致。如果谁对公家财物马马虎虎，在这个机关是很难不受别人批评的。比方说，几根大头针丢在地下，看起来是件小事，但公务员同志扫地的时候，总要一根一根拣起来。次数多了，他准要把这种现象写成稿子，登在黑板报上。开始，曾有人对这种作法感到别扭。如今，大家都认为互相监督是理所当然的事了。办公室副主任尹辅仁说：“我们根据必用的一定用、可用可不用就尽量不用的原则，几年来我们的行政费用年年都有节余上交。这和同志们艰苦朴素的作风是分不开的。”
    盐务局的办公室和宿舍都很老旧。为了改善环境，几年来，盐务局的全体人员，都经常挽起袖子参加大扫除。一走进盐务局大门，所看到的虽然多是古老的木柱、门窗，和陈旧的桌、椅、橱、箱等。但是，经过勤恳的主人们不断整理洗刷，看去都很整齐清洁。从1954年开始，他们连续获得杭州市机关卫生甲级优胜单位的光荣称号。今年8月间，台风过境时，有好几间房子被风吹倒了。盐务局的同志就自己动手清理被损坏了的房屋和家具，还把清理的废料都变价上缴国库了。机关事务管理局看到这种情况，根据必需的原则，就主动拨款为盐务局盖了一座二层楼办公室。
    新华社天津17日电　新华社记者黄军报道：天津市税务局是全市各机关行政费用开支最少的一个。一天上午，我特地到这个局访问。
    我首先访问的是总务科。副科长魏世岚对我说，从今年1月到11月底，全局及所属系统行政费用的开支已经节余了三万二千一百多元。最近三年来行政费用年年都有节余，1954年节余五万五千多元，1955年节余六万二千多元。他说，他们机关一向注意贯彻“可开支可不开支一般就不开支”的精神。市局和九个区分局所有值十元钱以上和能用一年以上的家具，都登记在帐册上，可以随时根据多余或不足调剂使用。加上税务局的人员没有增加，因此，去年和今年全局都没有花过一文购置费。
    这位副科长认为，节约在他们机关里已成为全体工作人员自觉的事情，于是他带领我参观他们的各个地方。最先我们来到了文书档案科，油印员陈国梁正在印表格，当他把每一张腊纸印完后，不像许多油印员通常所做的那样，把它扔掉或者烧掉，而是小心地用刀把废腊纸上沾带着的很多油墨刮下来重新使用。陈国梁说，由于他这样做，每一盒油墨可以多印出七、八千份文件或表格。
    这个局有局长和两位副局长，按市人民委员会规定，可以有两辆汽车，但他们只共用一辆。据汽车司机魏恩科谈，局长们只是到远处开会或工作的时候才使用汽车，平常上下班，他们都骑自行车。
    为了了解这个局能够这样朴素这样节约的原因，最后我访问了局长李文全。他说，他们这个机关是个为国家理财的机关，税务工作人员们一般都知道人民和国家的收入是来之不易的。自1952年“三反”“五反”运动以后，他们每年都进行一次反对贪污浪费、提倡增产节约的检查和教育。去年全体干部还共同制定了税务工作人员守则，规定每一个税务工作人员要自觉地爱护公共财物，反对铺张浪费和享乐思想，发扬艰苦朴素、廉洁奉公的优良作风。他谦虚地说，他们的节约成绩并不是很大的。他们最近正在贯彻中共中央二中全会的精神，在全局的干部中再进一步地进行一次艰苦朴素的教育。
