Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: More than a thousand young technicians and staff in the capital's construction industry gathered today to exchange experiences in mastering science and technology and saving steel, cement, timber, and other materials.

At today's meeting, two young technicians and representatives of two advanced youth collectives introduced their experiences. Zhang Chunsheng, a young statistics worker from the No. 2 Engineering Department of the North China Direct Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, introduced the rapid acceptance method created by his team. This rapid acceptance method involves marking construction drawings and then calculating the amount of work, saving manpower and ensuring accuracy. Zhu Zhenyu, a technician at the concrete control station of the Modelkou Hydropower Station Tunnel Construction Zone of the Yongding River Water Diversion Project, discovered that the concrete mix ratio required for the tunnel lining project was unreasonable. He performed multiple calculations, comparisons, and experiments, proving that the amount of cement per cubic meter of concrete could be reduced from the original 294 kilograms to 250 kilograms while still meeting quality requirements. When he encountered obstacles, he wrote eight consecutive reports to the leaders of the construction zone, and it was finally adopted, saving the country 320 tons of cement. He also introduced his experience today.

　  首都建筑业青年技职人员
　　集会交流技术和节约经验
    据新华社30日电　首都建筑业一千多名青年技术人员和职员，今日集会交流了掌握科学技术和节约钢筋、水泥、木材等的经验。
    今天在会上介绍经验的有两个青年技术员和两个青年先进集体的代表。建筑工程部华北直属工程公司第二工程处青年统计工作者张春生介绍了他的小组创造的快速验收法。这种快速验收法是在施工图纸上打下记号然后计算工程量，既节省人力又准确。永定河引水工程模式口水电站隧洞工区混凝土控制站技术员朱振宇，发现隧洞衬砌工程所需要的混凝土配合比不合理，就多次计算、比较和试验，证明每立方公尺混凝土可以由原来用水泥二百九十四公斤降低为二百五十公斤，质量也能达到要求。当他遭到阻挠的时候，又连续八次给工区领导人写报告，最后终于被采纳，目前已经为国家节约了三百二十吨水泥。今天他也介绍了经验。
