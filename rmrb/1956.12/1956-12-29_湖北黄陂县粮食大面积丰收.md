    Hubei Huangpi County Achieves Large-Scale Grain Harvest
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Our correspondent Gu Weijin reports from Hubei: Huangpi County in Hubei Province has achieved a large-scale grain harvest. In 1956, the average yield per mu on more than 800,000 mu of land in the county was 808 jin, an increase of 33.75% compared to the bumper year of 1955, exceeding the 1956 planned target by 13.62%. According to incomplete statistics, there were more than 228,200 mu of land with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu, and more than 4,200 mu of land with a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. The county has two "Thousand-Jin Districts," twenty-four "Thousand-Jin Townships," and two hundred and ninety-two "Thousand-Jin Cooperatives." Among the 1,633 agricultural cooperatives in the county, 1,407 cooperatives increased production compared to last year, accounting for more than 86% of the total number of cooperatives. Only twelve cooperatives reduced production. The county sold more than 94 million jin of surplus grain, exceeding the state's unified purchase task of surplus grain by 62.05%. The average amount of original grain retained per agricultural person in the county was 654 jin, an increase of 45% compared to 1949.
    In 1956, Huangpi County fully utilized the favorable conditions of the cooperatives in agricultural production and implemented "Five Reforms" according to local conditions. The first was soil and seed improvement. The county promoted improved rice varieties such as "Double-Season Japonica," "Nante," and "Victory Indica," as well as improved wheat varieties such as Nanda 2419, all of which yielded significantly more than local varieties (increasing production by 100 to 200 jin per mu). The second was to expand the multiple cropping area to harvest an extra season. In 1956, the multiple cropping area in the county expanded from more than 162,000 mu to more than 349,000 mu. Among them, more than 159,000 mu of single-season rice were converted to double-season rice, increasing production by more than 400 jin per mu compared to single-season rice. In addition, significant achievements were also made in converting sloping fields into terraced fields, dry fields into paddy fields, and low-yield fields into high-yield fields.
    To ensure the implementation of the "Five Reforms," the county vigorously carried out water conservancy projects, increasing the area of land with guaranteed harvests and basic guaranteed harvests from 320,000 mu in 1955 to 520,000 mu. The county also launched a large-scale mass fertilizer accumulation campaign, accumulating more than 184 million dan of natural fertilizer. In the past, 60% of the fields used commercial fertilizer, but in 1956, 75% used natural fertilizer. An average of 250 dan of base fertilizer was applied per mu of land, doubling the amount compared to last year. The county's eleven agricultural technology extension stations and a large number of peasant technicians also played a significant role in improving technology and striving for a bumper harvest.
    The Huangpi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party implemented concrete and in-depth leadership over agricultural production after collectivization. In the spring of 1956, problems such as labor quota management in the county's agricultural cooperatives had not been resolved, resulting in serious idling of labor. Shi Ming, secretary of the County Party Committee, and others delved into key areas of work, conducted research based on local and external experiences, formulated reasonable labor quotas and graded remuneration, and contracting work and output, and introduced them at the county-level cadre expansion meeting. More than 90% of the cooperatives formulated labor quotas, graded remuneration, and contracting work and output schemes according to local conditions, thereby gradually eliminating the phenomenon of idling and putting production order back on track.
    Throughout the year, the County Party Committee paid attention to strengthening the leadership at the grassroots level, changing the situation of strong leadership at the top and weak leadership at the bottom. After the mergers of townships across the county, the County Party Committee sent sixteen district-level cadres and thirty-two district assistants with certain working abilities to serve as party branch secretaries of the townships; 124 township cadres were sent to serve as cooperative directors. In addition, 170 cadres were drawn to form seventeen working groups, stationed long-term in the cooperatives to help with work. After these cadres were sent to the grassroots level, the work progressed relatively smoothly. The County Party Committee attached importance to production leadership in backward areas. In every production link, the County Party Committee sent strong cadres to backward areas to inspect production conditions, classify and rank crops, identify the reasons for lagging field work, and promptly mobilize the masses to carry out processing and cultivation, so that the average unit area yield per mu of land in 15%-20% of the county's fields with lagging field management increased by about 80% compared to 1955.

    湖北黄陂县粮食大面积丰收
    本报讯　驻湖北记者古维进报道：湖北省黄陂县粮食大面积丰收。1956年全县八十多万亩田平均每亩产量八百零八斤，比丰收的1955年增产33.75％，超过1956年的计划指标13.62％。据不完全统计，全县亩产千斤的田有二十二万八千二百多亩，亩产千斤以上的田有四千二百多亩。全县有两个“千斤区”，二十四个“千斤乡”，二百九十二个“千斤社”。全县一千六百三十三个农业社中，比去年增产的有一千四百零七个社，占总社数的86％以上。减产的只有十二个社。全县出售余粮九千四百多万斤，超过国家统购余粮任务62.05％。全县农业人口平均每人留原粮六百五十四斤，比1949年增加45％。
    黄陂县1956年在农业生产上充分运用了合作社的有利条件，因地制宜地推行了“五改”。首先是土种改良种。全县推广“双季粳”、“南特”、“胜利籼”等稻谷良种和南大二四一九等小麦良种，都比本地品种增产很多（每亩增产一百斤到二百斤）。其次是扩大复种面积，多收一季。1956年全县复种面积由十六万二千多亩扩大到三十四万九千多亩。其中单季稻改双季稻十五万九千多亩，每亩比单季稻增产四百多斤。此外，坡田改梯田，旱田改水田，低产改高产，也取得了不少成绩。
    为了保证“五改”措施的实现，全县曾经大力兴修水利，使全县保收和基本保收面积由1955年的三十二万亩增加到五十二万亩。全县还开展了大规模的群众性的积肥运动，积蓄自然肥料一亿八千四百多万担；过去60％的田采用商品肥料，1956年变为75％采用自然肥料；平均每亩田施底肥二百五十担，比去年增加一倍。全县的十一个农业技术推广站和大批的农民技术员，对于改进技术、争取丰收也起了很大作用。
    中共黄陂县委对于合作化后的农业生产实行了具体深入的领导。1956年春季，全县农业社的劳动定额管理等问题没有解决，造成严重的窝工现象。县委书记史明等深入工作重点，根据本地和外地的经验进行研究，制定出合理的劳动定额和分级报酬、包工包产等办法，并在全县扩干会上介绍。有90％以上的社因地制宜地制定了劳动定额以及分级报酬、包工包产方案，从而逐渐消灭窝工现象，生产秩序走上正常。
    在全年的工作中，县委注意充实基层领导力量，改变上强下弱的现象。全县并乡后，县委派出区委级干部十六人和有一定工作能力的区助理员等三十二人，担任乡的党支部书记；派出乡干部一百二十四人，担任社主任。另外，抽调一百七十个干部组成十七个工作组，长期驻在合作社里帮助工作。这些干部派到基层后，工作进行比较顺利。县委重视对落后地区的生产领导，在每一个生产环节里，县委都派出强有力的干部到落后地区检查生产情形，将作物进行分类排队，找出田间工作落后的原因，及时发动群众进行加工培育，使全县15％—20％的田间管理落后的田平均每亩单位面积产量比1955年提高80％左右。
