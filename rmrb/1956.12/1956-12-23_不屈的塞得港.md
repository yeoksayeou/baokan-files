    The Unyielding Port Said
    By our correspondent Jiang Yuanchun
    December 19th, the road to Port Said was finally open. British troops withdrew from the checkpoint at the entrance to the city, and reporters were allowed to enter after obtaining permission from the United Nations Emergency Force. However, Egyptian drivers were still not permitted, so if reporters wanted to enter Port Said, they had to drive themselves or ride in UN vehicles.
    Thus, we rode in a UN vehicle towards Port Said. The United Nations Emergency Force's control area began just north of Kantara. Around ten o'clock, we arrived at Port Said and saw from afar four British planes circling and diving over the city, intimidating the citizens.
    Indian troops were stationed at the city entrance. They checked the documents issued to us by the United Nations Emergency Force, and then we entered the city. Behind barbed wire in the dock area, some British soldiers could be seen standing behind sandbags. Five or six transport ships were anchored in the dock area. It is said that the headquarters of the Anglo-French invading forces had been moved from the Suez Canal Company to a ship. The withdrawal of troops was entering its final stage.
    Our car stopped at the train station. The square in front of the station was divided in half by barbed wire, one side controlled by the United Nations Emergency Force and the other jointly controlled by the Egyptian police and the United Nations Emergency Force. There were now 1,800 Egyptian police stationed in Port Said. The British invading forces still occupied the European residential areas scattered around the port and along the canal, while the French invading forces occupied Port Fuad. But the Arab area in the west of the city was entirely under the jurisdiction of the Egyptian police, and the United Nations Emergency Force only remained in the houses used as their temporary camps. They erected barbed wire around these houses, separating themselves from the Egyptian people.
    As soon as we entered the Arab area, a group of Egyptians walked towards us. When they learned that we were Chinese reporters from Beijing, they cheered and saluted us, and shouted "Nasser." Many people held portraits of President Nasser in their hands. We saw that on many houses, along with portraits of President Nasser, flew the Egyptian flag and the liberation flag with black and white stripes and a red stripe in the middle.
    Many young people volunteered to be our guides and escorts, to help us understand what had happened in the city recently. On Shat Shagra Street, many people were wandering in the streets or sitting in coffee shops. Many shops had opened, and these shops only began to operate after the United Nations Emergency Force controlled this area. Before that, despite repeated threats from the invaders, no one cooperated with the enemy. We heard that the British authorities were willing to give Egyptian workers who worked for them two Egyptian pounds a day, but no one went.
    The eastern end of Shat Shagra Street is still occupied by British troops, and it is desolate there. Only a few British soldiers are patrolling. Near the barbed wire, there were still bloodstains. Three days ago, the British invading forces had shot and killed a milk delivery worker here, simply because he wanted to deliver milk to the residents in the occupied area.
    We were led to the western end of the street. Many slogans were written on the asphalt road in Arabic and English: "Port Said crushed your greed," "Long live Egypt," "Despicable Eden"... A Greek man ran out of a coffee shop and shook hands with us, telling us that the people of all ethnic groups in Port Said had united to resist the enemy.
    Many buildings in the Arab residential area were destroyed by the enemy from the air or sea. The situation in the Manakh district was particularly shocking. An area of approximately one square kilometer had been razed to the ground. This used to be a beautiful residential area, full of two- to four-story buildings, but now there was nothing left except piles of rubble and a few charred palm trees. On November 6th, the invaders bombed this area with 30,000 residents, and the entire area was immediately engulfed in flames, with most residents barely escaping with their lives. In this frenzied bombing by the British army, 300 people were burned alive. Now, some refugees have built simple homes out of the remaining lead sheets on the rubble. A woman named Abtel Miyat led us to see her miserable home made of lead sheets, where her four-story building once stood. She has six children, her husband died in the Palestine War, and this time her mother was burned. Her four hundred Egyptian pounds in banknotes have been reduced to ashes, and she collects them in a box, showing them to everyone who visits.
    Many refugees live in schools used as first-aid stations. Six or seven families are crowded into one classroom. They brought almost nothing out of their bombed homes. Almost every family lost relatives in this war. The government now provides them with food, clothing, and bedding. But there is still a shortage of food throughout the city. People have not seen bread for two months and have been living on potatoes and beans.
    Many hospitals, schools, and even mosques have been barbarously bombed and strafed by the invaders. It is estimated that 7,000 people died and 21,000 were injured. About 70,000 people fled Port Said. Many people were arrested by the enemy, and no one knows their whereabouts to this day. Some say they have been sent to Cyprus.
    Someone also told us that when the enemy troops landed in Port Said on November 6th, they sent out a tank with a large red flag hanging on it. People thought it was a Soviet volunteer army and went to welcome it with cheers. At this time, the invaders' tanks cruelly opened fire on the unarmed residents, and the planes also strafed from low altitude. This time, 56 residents, including 20 children, were killed, and they were buried in a stadium that had been used by the enemy to imprison arrested civilians. British soldiers robbed the citizens of everything. An old man named Gerach waited for us from morning to afternoon, insisting on inviting us to see his home. His home was on the fifth and sixth floors of a building, and all the rooms were a mess. British officers destroyed everything in search of jewelry and money. Many people wanted us to visit their homes and let us see the enemy's atrocities with our own eyes. Unfortunately, we had to leave the area by 3:00 pm in a United Nations vehicle, so we could not accept their invitations to learn more details.
    The invaders used every means to try to subdue the people, but Port Said would never surrender. Everyone, even children, participated in the struggle against the enemy. They worked with the army to eliminate the enemy's paratroopers. After the enemy occupied the city, they hid their guns underground. Young people formed groups, sniped individual British invaders, and carried out propaganda and agitation among the residents. Fisherman Joseph Salem showed us the rifle and ammunition he dug out of the ground and gestured to us how he fought the enemy paratroopers.
    A green flag printed with President Nasser's portrait was flying on a street. In front of the flag, a traitor wearing a British military uniform was hanging upside down. On another street, there was also a traitor with the word "Eden" written on his body, one arm cut off, thrown under President Nasser's portrait. When we photographed these executed traitors, the surrounding crowd cheered loudly.
    The enemy also destroyed part of the Gemayel district, which is still under the occupation of the British invading forces, and we could not go there. The tap water equipment that had been destroyed by the enemy has been repaired. After the Anglo-French invading forces have completely withdrawn, urban life will surely be restored quickly.
    When we left Port Said in the afternoon, several British bombers and fighters were circling over the city. The buzzing sound of these planes seemed to be the sighs and moans of the imperialists, because they had failed to subdue the people of Port Said. Of course, they were filled with resentment, but what could they do now!

    不屈的塞得港
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    12月19日，去塞得港的路终于通了。英国军队从入口处的检查站撤到城里，记者得到联合国紧急部队的允许后能够进去了。但是埃及司机仍然没有获准，因此，记者要进塞得港的话，必须亲自驾驶汽车，或者乘联合国的车子。
    这样，我们乘联合国的车子驶向塞得港。联合国紧急部队的控制区起自坎塔拉稍北。大约在十点钟，我们到达了塞得港，并且远远看见四架英国飞机在城市上空盘旋俯冲，恐吓市民。
    印度部队驻扎在城市入口处。他们检查了联合国紧急部队发给我们的证件，于是我们就进城了。在码头地区铁丝网后面，可以看到站在沙袋后面的一些英国士兵。码头一带停泊着五六只运输船。据说，英法侵略军的司令部已经从运河公司搬到一只船上去了。撤军正进入最后阶段。
    我们的汽车停在火车站。车站前的广场给铁丝网分为两半，一边为联合国紧急部队控制，另一边为埃及警察和联合国紧急部队联合控制。现在塞得港已驻有一千八百名埃及警察。英国侵略军仍然占领着散布在港口和运河沿岸一带的欧洲人居住区，法国侵略军占据着福德港。但城市西部的阿拉伯区完全在埃及警察的管辖下，联合国紧急部队只留在作为他们的临时营地的房屋内。他们在这些房屋周围架起铁丝网，和埃及人民隔开。
    我们刚进入阿拉伯区，一群埃及人就向我们走来。当他们知道我们是北京来的中国记者时，就向我们欢呼致敬，并高呼“纳赛尔”。许多人手里拿着纳赛尔总统的肖像。我们看到许多房屋上，和纳赛尔总统的肖像一起，飘扬着埃及国旗和黑白二色夹有红条的解放旗。
    很多年轻人自愿作我们的向导和护送者，让我们了解城里这一向发生的事。在沙特·沙格拉尔街，许多人在街头流浪或者坐在咖啡店里。不少商店已开门了，这些商店是在联合国紧急部队控制这个地区后才开始营业的。在这以前，尽管侵略者一再威胁，却没有一个人和敌人合作。我们听说，英国当局愿给为他们工作的埃及工人两个埃及镑一天，但是没有人去。
    沙特·沙格拉尔街的东端现在仍旧为英国部队占据着，那里一片荒凉。仅有一些英国士兵在巡逻。靠近铁丝网还有斑斑血迹，三天前，英国侵略军曾在这里抢杀了一个送牛奶的工人，只因为他想把牛奶送给居住在占领区的居民。
    我们被引至街道的西端。柏油路面上写着许多阿拉伯文和英文的口号：“塞得港粉碎了你们的贪心”，“埃及万岁”，“卑鄙的艾登”……。一个希腊人从咖啡店里奔出来和我们握手，告诉我们，塞得港的各族人民曾经团结起来反抗敌人。
    阿拉伯居民区内的许多建筑被敌人从空中或海上炸毁了。马纳赫区的境况尤使人吃惊。大约有整整一平方公里的区域被夷为平地。这里原来是一个美丽的住宅区，到处是两层到四层的楼房，如今除了堆堆瓦砾和几棵烧焦了的棕榈树外什么也不剩了。11月6日，侵略者轰炸了这片有三万居民的地区，整个地区立即陷入一片火海中，大部分居民仅以身免。在英军这一次狂炸中，三百个人被活活烧死了。现在，一些难民在瓦砾堆上用残留的铅皮建起了简陋不堪的家。一个名叫阿卜特尔·米亚特的妇女领我们看她的用铅皮钉起来的凄惨的家，这里原来耸立着她的一所四层楼房。她有六个孩子，丈夫在巴勒斯坦战争中牺牲了，这次母亲又受了火伤。她的四百埃及镑的钞票已经化为灰烬，她把它们收集在一只匣子里，给每一个来此访问的人看。
    不少难民住在用作急救中心站的学校里。六、七家挤在一间教室内。他们从炸毁的家里几乎什么也没有带出来。差不多每个家庭都在这次战争中失去了亲人。政府现在供给他们食物、衣服和被褥。但是现在全市仍缺乏食物。人们两个月来没有见到过面包，仅以马铃薯和豆子为生。
    许多医院、学校甚至清真寺都遭到侵略者的野蛮轰炸和扫射。估计有七千人死亡，二万一千人受伤。大约七万人逃出了塞得港。很多人被敌人逮捕了，迄今谁也不知道他们的下落。有人说他们已经被送到塞浦路斯。
    有人还告诉我们说，11月6日敌军在塞得港登陆时，派出了一辆挂着一面大红旗的坦克。人们以为是苏联志愿军，欢呼着去迎接。这时侵略者的坦克即残忍地向没有武装的居民开火，飞机也从低空扫射。这一次，五十六个居民，包括二十个孩子，给杀死了，他们被埋在一个曾被敌人用来监禁被捕平民的体育场内。英国士兵抢走了市民的一切。一位名叫格拉赫的老人从早晨到下午等着我们，坚持要请我们看一看他的家。他的家在一幢楼房的第五与第六层，所有房间都是乱糟糟的一团。英国官兵为搜寻珠宝金钱，把什么都捣毁了。许多人要我们去拜访他们的家，让我们亲眼看看敌人的暴行。可惜我们必须在下午三点钟前乘联合国的汽车离开此地，因而不能接受他们的邀请去了解更多的详细情况。
    侵略者用尽一切手段企图使人民屈服，但塞得港决不投降。所有的人甚至连小孩都参加了对敌斗争。他们和军队一起消灭了敌人的伞兵部队。敌军占领城市后，他们就把枪支藏在地下。年轻人组成小组，狙击个别行动的英国侵略兵，并在居民中进行宣传鼓动。渔民约瑟夫·萨勒姆把他从地下挖出的步枪和弹药给我们看，并以动作向我们表示他如何与敌人伞兵作战。
    一面印着纳赛尔总统肖像的绿色的旗，在一条街上飘扬，在旗前，一个身穿英军制服的奸细头脚倒立地挂着。在另一条街上也有一个身上被写上“艾登”字样的奸细，一条臂被割断了，抛在纳赛尔总统肖像的下面。当我们拍摄这些被处决的奸细的照片时，周围的人群高声欢呼起来。
    敌人还破坏了加密尔区的一部分，现在仍在英国侵略军占领下，我们去不了。被敌人毁坏的自来水设备已经修复了。英法侵略军全部撤出以后，城市生活一定能迅速恢复。
    下午我们离开塞得港的时候，几架英国轰炸机和战斗机在城市上空兜圈子。这些飞机发出的嗡嗡声仿佛是帝国主义者的叹息和哀鸣，因为他们没有能使塞得港人民屈服。当然，他们是痛恨万分的，但是他们现在又有什么办法呢！
