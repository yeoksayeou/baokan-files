High Molecular Compounds
Wang Baoren

The manufacture of various production tools and daily necessities requires suitable materials. The acquisition of new materials can promote production development. Before this century, the materials used in industry, such as steel, non-ferrous metals, ceramics, cement, glass, stone, wood, bamboo, cellulose, rubber, etc., were either obtained directly from nature for application or applied after some chemical processing. Natural resources are often limited by regions, such as the uneven distribution of mineral deposits and variations in climate, which impose certain restrictions on the production of various countries and regions. At the same time, the development of production puts forward requirements for new materials with specific properties, which the old materials can no longer meet. New materials—high molecular compounds—have emerged and developed under these circumstances.

Because many varieties of high molecular compounds have special and excellent properties that surpass all past materials, they have become indispensable materials for establishing modern industries (such as the electrical industry, airplane, automobile, and tractor industry, textile industry, heavy machinery industry, and many light industries), modernizing national defense, and improving the people's material and cultural life. Furthermore, the natural resources required to manufacture high molecular compounds are only coal, salt, sand, stone, water, and air (sometimes also requiring a very small number of minerals), which can be produced in large quantities without regional restrictions. Therefore, in the recent two or three decades, the development of high molecular compound production in various countries has been very rapid.

What are high molecular compounds? General compounds contain only a few to dozens of atoms in each molecule, with a maximum of no more than a few hundred. However, compounds like proteins, cellulose, and rubber contain tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of atoms in each molecule. Such compounds are called high molecular compounds. Previously, such large high molecular compounds were only natural products. At the beginning of this century, chemists used two chemical reactions, "addition polymerization" and "condensation polymerization," to produce many synthetic high molecular compounds.

Because of the special structure of high molecular compound molecules, their properties are significantly different from those of general compounds. According to the structure of the high polymer, it can be divided into two categories: linear and three-dimensional. In linear polymers, each molecule is composed of many atoms strung together to form a long main chain, with some groups attached to the chain. If the atoms in the main chain are all carbon atoms, it is called a "homochain" polymer. If the carbon atoms are combined with other elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen, it is called a "heterochain" polymer. These linear molecular chains are usually in a random coiled state. Some linear polymers, when an external force is applied to pull them, each coiled molecule can be straightened and elongated, and returns to its original shape after the external force is removed. These polymers are called elastomers. Some of them can be made into rubber, called rubber. Other linear polymers, such as some "heterochain" polymers or "homochain" polymers with polar groups, develop a strong mutual attraction between the molecular chains after being stretched, are arranged more neatly, have a partial crystalline state, and do not return to their original shape after the external force is removed, becoming tough filaments. These polymers are called fibers. There are also some linear polymers with very little elasticity, which soften when heated and can be molded into shapes, and do not change shape after cooling, called thermoplastic plastics.

The structure of a three-dimensional polymer is that many linear molecular chains are cross-linked to each other to form a network or lattice structure. This type of polymer has a certain shape and firmness. The more cross-linking, the firmer it is, able to withstand strong forces, and can be formed in molds, or made into large pieces and processed by machines. However, the method of directly making three-dimensional polymers is not common in industry. Generally, linear or smaller polymers are made first. Their molecular chains have groups that can continue to undergo chemical reactions. When the temperature rises, they can soften or even melt, and be molded into various shapes. When heated further, further chemical reactions occur, cross-linking occurs, and solid objects are formed. This type of polymer is called thermosetting plastic.

Below, we will introduce them according to the main applications of high molecular compounds—rubber, fiber, and plastic.

Rubber includes natural rubber and synthetic rubber. Natural rubber is a rubber latex secreted by Brazilian rubber trees when their trunks are cut open, so it is also called Brazilian rubber. Chemically, rubber belongs to the hydrocarbon class, and the main chain contains many double bonds. At higher temperatures, it can undergo a chemical reaction with sulfur (requiring accelerators) to form a small amount of cross-linking, can be molded into a certain shape, has a certain firmness, and maintains a certain elasticity, which is ordinary rubber. The leaves and branches of the Chinese Eucommia ulmoides tree contain a type of Eucommia rubber, which is harder and more corrosion-resistant than Brazilian rubber and is an excellent material for making cables. In addition to Brazilian rubber trees and Eucommia trees, some other plants, such as rubber grass, also contain rubber, but the quality is not good. The production areas of rubber-producing plants are subject to certain restrictions. To meet various needs, countries are producing synthetic rubber.

There are many types of synthetic rubber, and many have special properties that natural rubber does not have. The most important synthetic rubbers are: Buna rubber, which can replace natural rubber for general purposes, is inexpensive, and has good cold resistance. Styrene-butadiene rubber has wear-resistant properties compared to natural rubber and can be used for general purposes, such as tires, conveyor belts, and transmission belts. It is currently one of the most important synthetic rubbers. In addition, there are chloroprene rubber, nitrile rubber, isobutylene rubber, polysulfide rubber, silicone rubber, and so on.

Fibers also include natural fibers and synthetic fibers. Natural cellulose exists in cotton, wood, hemp, and various plants and is a raw material for the textile, papermaking, and other industries. After chemical processing, it can also be made into rayon, tire cord fabric for automobile tires, film sheets, paint, and plastic. The main synthetic fibers include: Polyamide fiber, which has high strength, wear resistance, chemical resistance, and does not absorb water. It is used to manufacture tire cord fabric for high-speed, heavy-duty aircraft tires and parachutes, and materials for aircraft flaps. It can also be used to make daily clothing and toothbrush bristles. It can also be made into films to make gasoline bags or superior substitute leather, with a tensile force about ten times greater than cowhide. Vinyl fiber is inexpensive and can supplement the shortage of textile fibers, while being more beautiful and durable, and can also be made into artificial leather. Protein fiber is a fiber made from animal and plant protein through chemical treatment, which can replace wool for textile use. In addition, there are polyester fiber, polyacrylonitrile fiber, and so on.

There are many types of plastics, and we will only list a few of the most important ones: Phenolic plastic, its manufacture has two stages. In the first stage, a plastic polymer is first made. It can be dissolved in a solvent and can also be softened when heated. The second stage has two treatment methods: The first is to mix it with fillers such as wood flour or asbestos, and then heat and pressure mold it to solidify into a hard object. Commonly used bakelite utensils, electrical parts, and brake pads in automobiles and airplanes, and bearings and bushings in giant machines such as steel rolling mills are all made of this polymer. They are more wear-resistant and durable than bronze. The second is to impregnate paper, cloth, wood chips, or wood with its solution, dry it, and then apply pressure at high temperature to become a laminated material. It can be used to make insulation boards, gears, airplane propellers, etc., which are lighter and stronger than metal. Urea-formaldehyde plastic has a lower strength than phenolic plastic, but its color is very light, and various dyes can be added. The pressed objects are translucent, so they are often called "electric jade." It can be used to manufacture the shells of instruments and radios. Because it has high insulation and arc resistance, it also has important uses in the electrical industry. Ethylene plastics, these plastics are all thermoplastic plastics, there are many types, and have many important uses in modern industry.

The application range of high molecular compounds, in addition to the examples mentioned above, has extensive uses in medicine, agriculture, and construction.

High molecular compounds are very useful. In our country's socialist construction cause, establishing a complete high molecular compound industrial system, producing various important high polymers, and supplying various industries with materials with excellent properties should be one of the most important tasks. At the same time, scientific workers should vigorously carry out scientific research on high molecular compounds, continuously make contributions, and gradually raise this emerging science to the world's advanced level.

    高分子化合物
    王葆仁
    各种生产工具和生活用品的制造，都需要有适宜的材料。新材料的获得，能促使生产发展。在本世纪以前，工业上所用材料如钢铁、有色金属、陶瓷、水泥、玻璃、石料、木竹材、纤维素、橡皮等等，都是从自然界取得直接应用，或经过一些化学加工再行应用的。天然资源常受到区域的限制，如矿藏分布不匀，气候寒暑不一等等，使各个国家各个地区的生产受到一定的限制。同时，生产的发展又提出具有特定性质的新型材料的要求，旧有的材料已不能满足。新型的材料——高分子化合物，就是在这种情况下出现和发展起来的。
    由于在高分子化合物中，有许多品种具有特殊优良的性质，为过去一切材料所不及，它们已成为建立现代化的工业（如电气工业、飞机汽车拖拉机工业、纺织工业、重型机器工业以及许多轻工业等），建立现代化的国防和提高人民的物质文化生活所不可缺少的材料了。又由于制造高分子化合物所需的天然资源，只是煤、盐、砂石、水和空气等（有时也需要极少数的矿物），可以大量生产而不受区域限制。因此，在最近二三十年内，各国高分子化合物生产的发展非常迅速。
    什么是高分子化合物？一般的化合物，每一个分子中只含有几个到几十个原子，最多也不超过几百个。可是像蛋白质、纤维素、橡胶等化合物，每一个分子里就含有几万到几十万个原子。这样的化合物，叫做高分子化合物。先前，这样大的高分子化合物，只是天然产物。到本世纪开始，化学家们用“加成聚合”和“缩合聚合”两种化学反应做出了许许多多合成的高分子化合物。
    因为高分子化合物分子的结构特殊，它们的性质也就和一般的化合物有显著的不同。按照高分子的结构，可分为线型和立体型两类。线型高分子，每一个分子是由许多原子串连成为长的主链，链上再附上一些基团。主链里的原子全部是碳原子的叫做“均链”高分子，如果是碳原子和一些其它元素如氧、氮等原子的叫做“杂链”高分子。这种线型分子链通常都是处于无规则的蜷曲状态。有一些线型高分子，当外力加上去拉它的时候，每个蜷曲的分子可以拉直伸长，外力除去后即恢复原状。这些高分子被称为弹性体。其中一部分可做成橡皮，叫做橡胶。另外一些线型高分子，如一些“杂链”高分子或“均链”而具有极性基团的高分子，拉长以后，分子链和分子链之间起了较强的相互吸引作用，排列得比较整齐，具有部分结晶状态，外力除去后不再恢复原状，成为坚韧的细丝。这些高分子就叫做纤维，还有一些线型高分子，弹性很小，遇热软化可以模塑成型，冷后不再改变形状，叫做热塑性塑料。
    立体型高分子的结构，由许多线型分子链相互交联起来，成为网状或格状结构。这类高分子具有一定形状和坚牢度。交联越多就越坚牢，能耐强力，可以在模中形成，也可以做成大块用机器加工。但是，直接制成立体型高分子的方法，在工业上并不常见，一般都是先制成线型的或是较小的高分子。它们的分子链上具有可以继续起化学作用的基团，当温度升高时，可以软化甚至熔融，模塑成各种形状。当继续加热时，起进一步的化学作用，发生交联，形成牢固的物件。这一类高分子叫做热固性塑料。
    下面就按照高分子化合物主要应用的分类——橡胶、纤维、塑料，来做一些介绍。
    橡胶，有天然橡胶和合成橡胶两类。天然橡胶是一种巴西橡树当树干割开后分泌出来的胶乳凝集成的，所以又叫巴西橡胶。橡胶在化学上是属于碳化氢类，主链中含有许多双键。在较高温度时，可以同硫黄起化学反应（需要促进剂），发生少量的交联，可塑成一定的形状，具有一定的坚牢度和保持一定的弹性，就是普通的橡皮。我国杜仲树叶子和枝干里，含有一种杜仲胶，比巴西橡皮硬，耐腐蚀，是做电缆的优良材料。除了巴西橡树和杜仲树外，还有一些植物，如橡胶草中也含有橡胶，不过质量不好。产生橡胶的植物，产区有一定的限制，为了适应各种需要，各国都在生产合成橡胶。
    合成橡胶种类很多，且有许多特殊的性能为天然橡胶所不及。最重要的合成橡胶有这几种：丁钠橡胶，可代替天然橡胶用于一般用途，价廉，耐寒性好。丁苯橡胶，具有比较天然橡胶耐磨的特性，可供一般用途，如轮胎、转运带、传动带等。它是目前最重要的合成橡胶之一。此外，还有氯丁橡胶、丁睛橡胶、异丁橡胶、聚硫橡胶、矽橡胶，等等。
    纤维，也有天然纤维和合成纤维两种。天然纤维素存在于棉花、木材、麻和各种植物中，是纺织造纸等工业的原料。经过化学加工又可以制成人造丝、汽车轮胎中的帘线衬布、胶卷软片、油漆和塑料。合成纤维主要的有以下几种：聚醯胺纤维，具有高度的强力，耐磨，耐化学品，不吸水。它是制造高速重载飞机轮胎的帘线衬布和降落伞、飞机辅翼的材料，也可以制造日常衣着和牙刷毛等。它又能制成薄膜，做汽油袋，或优级代用皮革，拉力较牛皮约大十倍。乙烯纤维，价格便宜，可以补充纺织用纤维的不足，而又比较美观耐用，也可以做成人造皮革。蛋白纤维，是利用动植物蛋白，经过化学处理制成的纤维，可以代替羊毛，供纺织用。此外，还有聚酯纤维、聚丙烯睛纤维，等等。
    塑料种类很多，现在只举几个最重要的；酚醛塑料，它的制造有两个阶段。第一阶段，先制成具有可塑性的高分子。它可以溶解于溶剂内，遇热也可软化。第二阶段有两种处理方法：第一种把它同木屑或石棉等填充料混合起来，再加高热压铸，凝固成坚硬的物件。日常用的电木器皿，电气零件，以及汽车飞机中的刹车片，巨型机器如轧钢机中的轴瓦轴承，都用这种高分子制造。它们比青铜更耐磨经用。第二种是把它的溶液浸渍纸、布、木片或木料，晾干后再在高温下加压，就成为层压材料。可以做绝缘板、齿轮，飞机螺旋桨等，比金属轻而强度大。脲醛塑料，强度不如酚醛塑料，但颜色很淡，可以加入种种染料，压制出来的东西呈半透明，所以常称为电玉。可制造仪表、收音机的外壳。因为有高度绝缘和耐电火花的特性，在电气工业中也有重要的用途。乙烯类塑料，这类塑料都是热塑性塑料，种类很多，在现代工业中有很多重要的用途。
    高分子化合物的应用范围，除上面所谈的几个例子以外，在医疗、农业、建筑方面都有广泛的用途。
    高分子化合物的用处是很大的。在我们国家社会主义建设事业中，建立一个完整的高分子化合物工业体系，生产各种重要的高分子，供给各种工业以性质优良的材料，应该是最重要的任务之一。同时科学工作者还应大力开展高分子化合物的科学研究，不断地作出贡献，来把高分子这门新兴的科学逐步地提高到世界先进水平。
