    Ishibashi Cabinet Decides to Temporarily Halt Purchases of US Surplus Agricultural Products
    And Will Request the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) to Relax the Embargo
    Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese government decided yesterday to temporarily halt purchases of US surplus agricultural products and decided to establish a committee to study whether to import them next year.
    It is reported that all departments of the Japanese government, except for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, believe that there is no need to conclude an agreement with the United States to purchase surplus agricultural products next year, because Japan has had bumper rice harvests in the past two years.
    Kyodo News said that the United States is paying "close attention" to the Japanese government's decision. "The United States believes that the Ishibashi Cabinet will adopt a more independent policy than the Hatoyama Cabinet, and will more strongly reflect Japan's interests in coordinating with the United States. Therefore, the United States is worried that this announcement of the cessation of purchases (of US surplus agricultural products) may be an indication of a rather lasting policy that the Ishibashi Cabinet intends to take."
    Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: Tokyo dispatch: Matsuo Taiichiro, Director of the Trade Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, said yesterday that the Japanese government is about to contact the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) to request a relaxation of the embargo restrictions on China.
    Matsuo also said that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is studying the establishment of a trade organization in order to conduct trade with China in a unified manner.

    石桥内阁决定暂时停购美剩余农产品
    并将要求巴黎统筹委员会放宽禁运
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本政府昨天决定暂时停止购买美国剩余农产品，并且决定成立一个委员会来研究明年是否输入。
    有消息说，除了农林省以外，日本政府的所有部门都认为明年没有必要同美国缔结购买剩余农产品的协定，因为日本这两年大米丰收。
    共同社说，美国对于日本政府的决定“非常注意”。“美国认为，石桥内阁将采取比鸠山内阁更为自主的政策，在对于美国的协调方面，将更加强烈地反映日本的利益。因此，美国耽心这次宣布的停止购买（美国剩余农产品）的措施可能是石桥内阁所要采取的相当持久的政策的一种表示。”
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本通商产业省通商局长松尾泰一郎在昨天说，日本政府即将同巴黎统筹委员会接洽，要求放宽对中国的禁运限制。
    松尾还说，通商产业省正在研究成立一个贸易团体，以便统一地同中国进行贸易。
