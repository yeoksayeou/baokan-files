Early Winter Passage Through the Three Gorges
　　Xiao Qian

    Three

    The most breathtaking sight is the wooden boats in the rapids. Some are out fishing, others are transporting Sichuan oranges and hemp downstream. The bold boatmen steer these fragile wooden boats along the jagged cliffs, battling the raging whirlpools in the heart of the river. The wind tilts the boat, and the waves wash over the bow, but the brave oarsmen still sing their work songs in the strong wind.

    At that moment, a whistle blows, and the steamer is about to pass. The wooden boat quickly rows towards the riverbank. As the steamer passes, the ten thousand dragons rolling in the river become a hundred thousand, and the wooden boat bobs and tosses like a lotus petal in a storm. No matter what, the oarsmen continue to sing their work songs, moving forward against the current. Their method of conquering the Three Gorges is ancient and outdated, but they are still conquerors.

    The mountains and rivers of the Three Gorges inspire awe, but even more awe-inspiring is the courage and skill of the working people along the gorges in conquering nature and seeking survival. On those towering cliffs, one can vaguely make out hundreds of layers of tiny stone steps, crisscrossing and winding, truly a winding path with thirty-six turns. Sometimes, a bamboo ladder more than ten zhang long hangs down from the steep cliffs, looking like some kind of crawling creature wriggling on the crags. Above, white smoke rises from rows of thatched huts. Looking through a telescope, one can also see firewood, cured meat, or fishing gear drying under the eaves, and the mounds next to them are probably their ancestral graves. Fields and livestock are often seen in the gorges. On the cliffs where only eagles can reach, ancient people built pagodas and temples.

    When the boat reaches Nanjin Pass, a completely different scene suddenly appears on the shore: a row of new wooden houses and white tents are set up at the foot of the mountain. At this time, a group of young men are shouting and fighting for the ball under the basketball hoop. What familiar sounds! I hear the resounding sound of the road builders' iron shovels, and even louder sounds of blasting rocks. I quickly borrow a telescope to take a look, and a smiling face full of youthful vigor appears in the lens. What a coincidence, the lights come on at this moment. I see towering drilling rigs.

    It turns out that this is a major survey base, and the people on the shore are the creators of historical miracles. They conquer nature on a larger scale and with more sophisticated methods. They are designing to build the world's largest hydroelectric power station at the mouth of the Three Gorges, a hydroelectric power station that can illuminate half of China. The Three Gorges will transform from a dangerous pass on the road to Sichuan into a source of happiness.

    The mountain scenery gradually changes from magnificent to ordinary, and the boat finally safely exits the gorges in the vast twilight. From then on, the whirlpools disappear, the cliffs on both sides disappear, and the river surface is gentle and wide, resembling a lake. When the steamer turns, the hull cuts thousands of golden furrows on the river surface against the twilight, like ten thousand dragon-eyed fish chasing side by side at the stern.

    The fishing boats on the riverbank are no longer visible, and only a few withered reed-like masts can be seen sparsely where the sky and water meet. The sky is as dim as a mirror covered with dust, and a lone eagle is hovering there by itself. It seems to be pondering something, or it seems to be attached to this landscape and clouds.

    初冬过三峡
  　萧乾

    最令人惊心动魄的是激流里的木船。有的是出来打鱼的，有的正把川江的橘麻下运。剽悍的船夫就驾着这种弱不禁风的木船，沿着嶙峋的巉岩，在江心跟汹涌的漩涡搏斗。船身给风刮得倾斜了，浪花漫过了船头，但是勇敢的桨手们还在劲风里唱着号子歌。
    这当儿，一声汽笛，轮船眼看开过来了。木船赶紧朝江边划。轮船驶过，在江里翻滚的那一万条蛟龙变成十万条了，木船就像狂风中的荷瓣那样横过来倒过去地颠波动荡。不管怎样，桨手们依旧唱着号子歌，逆流前进。他们征服三峡的方法虽然是古老失时的，然而他们毕竟还是征服者。
    三峡的山水叫人惊服，更叫人惊服的是沿峡劳动人民征服自然，谋取生存的勇气和本领。在那耸立的峭壁上，依稀可以辨出千百层细小石级，交错蜿蜒，真是羊肠蟠道三十六回。有时候重岩绝壁上垂下一道长达十几丈的竹梯，远望宛如什么爬虫在巉岩上蠕动。上面，白色的炊烟从一排排茅舍里袅袅上升了。用望远镜眺望，还可以看到屋檐下晒的柴禾、腊肉或渔具，旁边的土丘大约就是他们的祖茔。峡里还时常看见田垅和牲口。在只有老鹰才飞得到的绝岩上，古代的人们建起了高塔和寺庙。
    船到南津关，岸上忽然出现了一片完全不同的景象：山麓下搭起一排新的木屋和白色的帐棚。这时候，一簇年轻小伙子正在篮球架子下面嘶嚷着，抢夺着。多么熟稔的声音啊！我听到了筑路工人铿然的铁锹声，也听到更洪亮的炸石声。赶紧借过望远镜来一望，镜子里出现了一张张充满了青春气息的笑脸。多巧啊，电灯这当儿亮了。我看见高耸的钻探机。
    原来这是个重大的勘察基地，岸上的人们正是历史奇迹的创造者。他们征服自然的规模更大，办法更高明了。他们正设计在三峡东边把口的地方修建一座世界最大的水电站，一座可以照耀半个中国的水电站。三峡将从蜀道上一道嶮巇的关隘，变成为幸福的源泉。
    山势渐渐由奇伟而平凡了，船终于在苍茫的暮色里，安全出了峡。从此，漩涡消失了，两岸的峭岩消失了，江面温柔广阔，酷似一片湖水。轮船转弯时，衬着暮霭，船身在江面轧出千百道金色的田垅，又像有万条龙睛鱼在船尾并排追踪。
    江边的渔船已经看不清楚了，天水交接处，疏疏朗朗只见几根枯苇般的桅杆。天空昏暗得像一面积满尘埃的镜子，一只苍鹰此刻正兀自在那里盘旋。它像是寻思着什么，又像是对这片山川云物有所依恋。
