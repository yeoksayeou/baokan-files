Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 22nd - Over two hundred newly joint state-private factories under the Shanghai First Light Industry Bureau have reduced workers' daily working hours from over ten hours to eight or eight and a half hours.

After shortening working hours, work efficiency has actually increased. At the Shanghai No. 3 Pen Parts Factory, after reducing daily working hours by one hour, workers improved sand casting equipment, and the output of copper ferrules more than doubled. At the Tianming Candy and Food Factory, after shortening the working hours of packaging workers, the amount of packaging increased by about 10% due to improved coordination between work sections and reduced waiting time for materials. In the Huakang Brush Factory, which implements piece-rate wages, workers used to work ten hours a day before the joint state-private ownership. In December, working hours have been reduced to eight and a half hours. This has allowed workers more time to exchange experiences and become more skilled in their operations, so their income remains the same as before, and some have even increased. This factory plans to strive for an eight-hour working day in the first half of next year based on further improving labor productivity.

Most of these factories are small in scale and mainly rely on manual operations. Workers' technical level is not high. During the private ownership period, although working hours were very long, income was very low. Workers had almost no time to participate in learning and recreational activities, and their health was also very poor. The shortening of working hours after joint state-private ownership has improved this situation.

### 工作时间缩短了  工作效率提高了

    工作时间缩短了  工作效率提高了
    新华社上海22日电　上海市第一轻工业局所属的两百多个新合营工厂，工人每天工作的时间已经从十小时以上减少到八小时或八小时半。
    工作时间缩短以后，工作效率反而提高了。上海制笔零件三厂的工人在每天减少一小时工作时间后，改进了翻砂设备，铜梗的产量比过去增加一倍以上。天明糖果食品厂的包装工人工作时间缩短后，由于改进了工段间的配合，停工待料时间减少，包装量提高10％左右。实行计件工资的华康毛刷厂，合营前工人每天要工作十小时，12月份工作时间已减到八小时半，这样工人有了更多时间互相交流经验，操作更加熟练，因此收入仍和过去一样，个别的还有增加。这个厂准备在进一步提高劳动生产率的基础上，争取在明年上半年实行八小时工作制。
    这些工厂绝大部分规模很小，主要依靠手工操作，工人技术水平不高，在私营时期，虽然工作时间很长，收入却很低，工人几乎没有参加学习和文娱活动的时间，健康状况也很坏。公私合营以后缩短了工作时间，这种情况就有了改善。
