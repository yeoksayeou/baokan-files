　　Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Federin and Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu exchanged instruments of ratification of the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration on the restoration of diplomatic relations and instruments of ratification of other relevant documents in Tokyo on the 12th. The state of war between the Soviet Union and Japan was thus declared over, and diplomatic relations between the two countries were formally restored. The Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration was signed in Moscow in October this year. The fact that the two sides were able to quickly ratify this joint declaration and bring it into effect in such a short period of time shows that both governments have adopted a positive attitude towards restoring normal relations between the two countries.

　　The Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration on the restoration of diplomatic relations was warmly supported by people from all walks of life in Japan after its publication. The Japanese people believe that this joint declaration shows that the Soviet Union has made many concessions to Japan, which has brought great benefits to the Japanese people. Even some Japanese political and business figures who previously held different views on the restoration of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations believe that the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration is acceptable and will produce good results if implemented. This reflects that it is in the interests and wishes of the Japanese people from all walks of life for the Japanese government to resolve the problems existing between it and the Soviet Union and to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union.

　　However, the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan has not been entirely smooth. Before and during the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, the United States colluded with some pro-American factions in Japan to obstruct Japan from restoring normal relations with the Soviet Union. The United States even used various crude pressures to force Japan to submit to its will. What is intriguing is that after Japan decided to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union and signed the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration, the United States did not dare to openly oppose this joint declaration, and hypocritically stated that Japan's restoration of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union was Japan's own business. Of course, this is not because the United States has abandoned its policy of interfering in Japan, but only because the United States sees that this demand cannot be stopped. If it continues to openly obstruct and undermine the restoration of Soviet-Japanese relations, it will further arouse the opposition of the entire Japanese people. This shows that if the Japanese government truly implements an independent and autonomous policy that is in line with the interests and wishes of the Japanese people, and obtains the support of the broad masses of the Japanese people, the United States will have to be somewhat cautious about interfering in Japan.

　　After the restoration of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations, the relations between the two countries will enter a new historical period. The long-standing specific issues between the two countries can be resolved reasonably through consultation. There are convenient conditions for the free exchanges between the people of the two countries and the economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries. Taking only the trade relations between the two countries as an example, with the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the protocol between the two countries on developing trade and granting each other most-favored-nation treatment will come into effect. This is of great significance for the development of trade between the two countries, especially Japan's foreign trade. In the ten years since the war, major changes have taken place in the situations of the Soviet Union and Japan. Although Japan's industrial production has developed more than before the war, the market is much smaller than before the war and is subject to the squeeze of Western countries, and many industrial products have no sales outlets. In the Soviet Union, the cause of socialist construction has been further developed, large-scale construction is underway in Siberia, and the living standards of the Soviet people have generally improved. There is a large market for both production equipment and daily necessities. Therefore, the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and Japan and the development of trade will bring great benefits to the economies and people's lives of the two countries, especially Japan.

　　After the Japanese government decided to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union, the Japanese people also eagerly hoped to quickly restore diplomatic relations with China. Now, many Japanese people's organizations and political parties are fighting to achieve this goal. A delegation from the Japanese Socialist Party will visit our country soon to discuss with our government the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the strengthening of friendly exchanges between the two countries. The Japanese House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution advocating the development of Sino-Japanese trade. This reflects the Japanese people's urgent desire to improve relations with China. The Japanese government should pay attention to this increasingly common desire and demand of the Japanese people, adopt a more positive attitude, and move forward on the road to normalizing Sino-Japanese relations.

　　The Chinese people warmly welcome the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, and believe that the normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and Japan is not only in line with the wishes and interests of the people of the two countries, but also contributes to the cause of peace in the Far East. Similarly, the Chinese people sincerely hope that the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan can be realized at an early date. In recent years, the Chinese people have made many efforts to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, and will continue to work together with the Japanese people to achieve this common wish.

### 苏日恢复邦交

    苏日恢复邦交
    苏联外交部副部长费德林和日本外务相重光葵，12日在东京交换了苏日两国恢复外交关系的联合宣言批准书和其它有关文件的批准书。苏联和日本之间的战争状态从此宣告结束了，两国的外交关系从此就正式恢复了。苏日联合宣言是今年10月间在莫斯科签订的。双方能够在这样较短的时间里迅速批准这个联合宣言并使之生效，说明两国政府对于恢复两国正常关系都采取了积极的态度。
    苏日两国恢复外交关系的联合宣言发表以后，得到了日本各阶层人民的热烈拥护。日本人民认为，这个联合宣言表明苏联对日本作了许多让步，使日本人民得到了很大好处。就是一部分过去对恢复苏日邦交持有不同见解的日本政界人士和实业界人士，也认为苏日联合宣言是可以接受的，实行起来将产生良好的效果。这反映了日本政府解决它同苏联之间所存在的问题，并同苏联恢复正常关系，是符合于日本各阶层人民的利益和愿望的。
    但是，苏日两国正常关系的恢复并不是十分顺利的。在苏日谈判以前和谈判期间，美国一直同日本的一部分亲美派勾结一起，阻挠日本同苏联恢复正常关系。美国甚至使用各种粗暴的压力来迫使日本屈从它的意旨。耐人寻味的是，在日本决心同苏联恢复正常关系和签订苏日联合宣言之后，美国却不敢公开地反对这个联合宣言，并且还虚伪地表示日本同苏联恢复外交关系是日本自己的事情。当然这并不是因为美国已经放弃对日本的干涉政策了，而只是因为美国眼看到这个要求已经无法阻挡，如果还硬要继续公开地阻挠和破坏苏日关系的恢复，就将更加激起全日本人民对它的反对。这说明，日本政府如果真正地执行符合日本人民利益和愿望的独立自主政策，得到了广大日本人民的支持，美国对日本的干涉是不能不有所顾忌的。
    苏日邦交恢复以后，两国的关系将进入一个新的历史时期。两国之间长期存在的各项具体问题，都可以通过协商的途径求得合理解决。两国人民之间的自由往来，两国的经济和文化交流，都有了方便的条件。仅以两国的贸易关系来说，随着两国外交关系的恢复，两国关于发展贸易和互相给予最惠国待遇的议定书便将生效。这对于发展两国的贸易特别是日本的对外贸易有着重要的意义。战后十多年来，苏日两国的情况都发生了重大变化。日本的工业生产虽然比战前有了发展，但是市场比起战前来狭小得多，并且受到西方国家的排挤，许多工业品没有销路。而在苏联，社会主义建设事业已有更大发展，西伯利亚正在进行大规模建设，苏联人民的生活水平普遍提高，无论生产设备和日常用品都有很大市场。因此，苏日两国正常关系的恢复和贸易的发展，将会对两国特别是对日本的经济和人民生活带来很大的利益。
    在日本政府决定同苏联恢复正常关系后，日本人民还迫切希望能迅速同中国恢复邦交。现在，日本许多人民团体和政党正在为争取实现这个目标而斗争。日本社会党代表团在不久之后将来我国访问，要同我国政府商谈恢复中日邦交和加强两国友好往来的事宜。日本国会众议院一致通过决议，主张发展中日贸易。这都反映了日本人民要求同中国改进关系的迫切心情。日本政府应当重视日本人民这种越来越普遍的愿望和要求，采取更为积极的态度，在促使中日关系正常化的道路上前进。
    中国人民热烈欢迎苏日两国恢复邦交，并且认为，苏日两国关系的正常化，不但符合两国人民的愿望和利益，而且也有助于远东的和平事业。同样，中国人民诚恳地希望中日两国邦交的恢复能够早日实现。几年来，中国人民为促使中日关系正常化，曾经作了许多努力，今后将继续同日本人民一道，争取实现这个共同的愿望。
