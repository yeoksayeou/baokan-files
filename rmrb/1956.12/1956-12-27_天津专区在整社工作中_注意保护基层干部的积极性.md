Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, December 25th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Deng Zichang): In the work of rectifying agricultural cooperatives, Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, helped cooperative cadres dispel their ideological concerns about being "rectified," implemented the principle of democratic cooperative management, and criticized the work style of coercion and commandism. This improved the ideological awareness of the cadres and strengthened the unity between cadres and cooperative members. At present, the agricultural cooperatives that are about to complete the rectification work have been consolidated and improved.

The focus of this prefecture's cooperative rectification work was on the third category of cooperatives, which were relatively weak in their work. At the beginning of the rectification work, many cooperative cadres had an unclear understanding of the significance of implementing the principle of democratic cooperative management and opposing the work style of coercion and commandism, which led to varying degrees of resistance. Mainly, they believed that many things were done according to instructions from above (referring to certain errors caused by the subjectivism of higher authorities), but when problems arose, only the lower-level cadres were "rectified," feeling that the effort was not worthwhile. Therefore, there was a widespread demand for replacements and a reluctance to continue as cadres. After discovering this situation, work teams in various counties and districts generally explained the significance of cooperative rectification and implementing the principle of democratic cooperative management to cooperative cadres. They also proactively took responsibility for the errors caused by the subjectivism of the county and district leadership and apologized directly to the masses. For cadres who made mistakes due to a lack of management experience or deviations in understanding, they were helped to find the root causes of their mistakes, make self-criticisms, and obtain the understanding of the masses. In this way, the cadres felt "confident" and actively participated in the cooperative rectification work. This spring, cadres of the Yanggezhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Baxian County simply followed instructions from above, disregarding actual conditions and forcing cooperative members to plant upland rice in waterlogged deep-water areas. As a result, the rice was flooded and there was no harvest, which displeased the cooperative members and made the cadres uneasy. This time, the county and district leadership explained the mistake and made a self-criticism, resolving the knots in the hearts of the cadres and cooperative members, enabling them to participate in the cooperative rectification work together, and giving them confidence in running the cooperative well in the future. Cadres of the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Jinghai County originally worried that cooperative rectification was about "rectifying cadres," abandoned their leadership of the cooperative, and even stopped managing winter sideline production. Later, with the help of the work team, they clarified the true purpose of cooperative rectification, not only enthusiastically engaged in the cooperative rectification work but also strengthened their leadership of sideline production, increasing the number of people participating in sideline production in the cooperative from 600 to 900, and increasing the daily income from sideline production in the cooperative from more than 190 yuan to 400 yuan.

Because the cooperative cadres dispelled their ideological concerns, truthfully examined their shortcomings and mistakes in their work, explained them to the cooperative members, and expressed their intention to overcome and correct them in the future, the cooperative members were greatly moved, feeling that they were truly masters of their own affairs, and became concerned and protective of the cooperative. While offering opinions to cooperative cadres, the cooperative members of the Hongxing, Lianmeng, and other five agricultural cooperatives in Jinghai County also conducted self-criticisms and put forward more than 20 rationalization proposals on how to run the cooperatives well.

### 天津专区在整社工作中  注意保护基层干部的积极性

    天津专区在整社工作中
    注意保护基层干部的积极性
    干部打消了怕“整”的顾虑，实事求是地检查工作
    社员们以当家做主的态度积极地提出批评和建议
    新华社保定25日电　新华社记者邓子常报道：河北省天津专区在整顿农业社的工作中，帮助社干部打消怕“整干部”的思想顾虑，贯彻了民主办社方针，批判了强迫命令作风，从而提高了干部的思想觉悟，加强了干部与社员之间的团结。目前，即将结束整顿工作的农业社都得到了巩固和提高。
    这个专区的整社工作是以工作比较薄弱的第三类社为重点的。在整顿工作开始的时候，由于很多社干部对贯彻民主办社方针，反对强迫命令作风的意义认识不清，曾产生不同程度的抵触情绪。主要是，他们认为有好些事情是按照上面指示去办的（指某些因上级主观主义造成的错误），一出问题却只“整”下边干部，觉得费力不讨好，因而较普遍的要求换班，不愿再当干部。各地县区工作组发现这一情况后，一般都向社干部说明整社和贯彻民主办社方针的意义，并且把属于县区领导上主观主义造成的错误的责任主动地承担过来，直接向群众道歉；对因缺乏管理经验或认识上有偏差而犯错误的干部，帮助他们找出错误的根源，进行检讨，取得群众谅解，这样，干部心里“有底”了，都积极地参加了整社工作。霸县杨各庄农业社干部，今春单纯按照上级指示办事，不顾实际条件，强迫社员在易涝深水地区栽种旱稻，结果被水淹了没有收成，社员不满意，干部心里也不安。这次，县区领导上说明了这个错误，并作了检讨，解开了干部和社员心里的疙疸，使他们一起参加了整社工作，并对今后办好合作社有了信心。静海县五星农业社干部，原先顾虑整社是“整干部”，放弃了对合作社的领导，连冬季副业生产也撒手不管了。后来，他们得到工作组的帮助，明确了整社的真正目的，不只热情地投入整社工作，并加强了对副业生产的领导，使全社参加副业生产的人数由六百名发展到九百名，全社每天副业收入由一百九十多元增加到四百元。
    由于社干部打消了思想顾虑，实事求是地检查自己在工作中的缺点和错误，向社员作了交代，并表示今后要加以克服和改正，这使社员们很受感动，觉得他们真是当家作主了，对合作社就关心和爱护了。静海县红星、联盟等五个农业社的社员们，在向社干部提意见的同时，还进行了自我批评，并且提出了如何把社办好的二十多条合理化建议。
