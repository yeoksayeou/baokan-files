    Shanghai Some Cotton Textile Factories
    Streamline Institutions and Reduce Layers
    Editor's Note: The large management institutions and the excessive number of non-production personnel in enterprises are common and serious problems at present. However, some enterprise leaders one-sidedly emphasize that this is the result of the large number of institutions, reports, and procedures of higher authorities, and believe that it is difficult to change the situation below if the situation above does not change. The practice of some cotton textile factories in Shanghai proves that these comrades' views are incorrect, and the shortcomings of the bloated institutions in enterprises can and should be actively overcome by the enterprises themselves.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th - Xinhua News Agency reporter Gao Jie reported: Some textile factories in Shanghai are recently studying how to reduce the layers of enterprise management institutions and make production command more flexible.
    Shanghai State-owned No. 5 Cotton Mill began to experiment in August last year with changing the original three-level management organization of factory, workshop, and team to a two-level system, abolishing the workshop-level organization. Over the past year, it has been proven that doing so can deepen leadership and improve work efficiency.
    This factory is a medium-sized textile factory with 44,000 spindles, 8,500 thread spindles, and 994 looms, with a total of more than 3,200 employees. Before the workshop level was abolished, the main departments such as planning, accounting, and labor were set up at the factory level, and the same was true at the workshop level. The workshop led the teams, the institution was large, there were many layers, and the work was repetitive. For the same task, the factory level, workshop level, and even team level had to hold at least two meetings, and there were three sets of work plans and work summaries. Problems that the factory director and chief engineer could directly solve had to go through the workshop, and the command was very inflexible. After the workshop level was abolished, the entire factory was divided into four large workshops: pre-spinning, post-spinning, preparation, and weaving, and the factory director and chief engineer directly led production. Wherever a problem occurred, the leaders would go there. In this way, problems were solved much faster than before.
    At a recent symposium on enterprise organizational structure, most of the textile factory representatives believed that factories with a scale of less than 100,000 spindles and only single spinning and weaving workshops, like the State-owned No. 5 Cotton Mill, could do without a workshop-level organization.
    Now, Shanghai State-owned No. 6 Cotton Mill, No. 11 Cotton Mill, No. 16 Cotton Mill, and other medium-sized factories have also abolished the workshop-level organization one after another.
    At present, the management personnel of general textile factories in Shanghai account for about 15% of the total number of employees in the factory. In contact with the leaders of the same textile factories, the reporter learned that the large number of management personnel is not only due to the need to train cadres for new textile factories, but also the overly detailed division of labor in the departments is also one of the important reasons for the large size of the enterprise institution. All state-owned textile factories, regardless of size, have almost fifteen to sixteen departments. For example, if a problem occurs in training workers, the factory director must find the heads of the education department and the labor and wage department to discuss it together before it can be resolved. Therefore, they believe that if some institutions are appropriately merged, the number of management personnel can also be reduced.

    上海部分棉纺织厂
    精简机构　减少层次
    编者按：企业管理机构庞大，非生产人员过多，在目前是普遍而严重的。但是，有些企业的领导人员片面地强调说这是上级机关机构多、表报多、手续多的结果，认为上面不变下面就很难改。上海部分棉纺织厂的做法证明，这些同志的看法是不对的，企业中机构臃肿的缺点，企业是可以而且应该主动地去克服的。
    新华社上海24日电　新华社记者高洁报道：上海一部分纺织厂最近正在研究怎样使企业管理机构层次减少，指挥生产灵活的问题。
    上海国棉五厂，去年8月起尝试把原来分为厂、工场、车间三级制的管理组织改为两级制，撤销工场一级组织。一年多来，证明这样做可以使领导深入，提高了工作效率。
    这个厂是一个有四万四千枚纱锭、八千五百枚线锭和九百九十四台织机的中型纺织厂，共有职工三千二百多人。没有撤销工场以前，厂一级设有的计划、会计、劳动等主要科室，工场一级同样设有。由工场领导车间，机构庞大，层次多，工作重复。同样一项工作，厂级到工场以至车间，至少要开两次会，工作计划、工作总结同样要三套。本来厂长、总工程师可以直接解决的问题，也要通过工场，指挥很不灵活。撤销工场一级以后，全厂分为前纺、后纺、准备、织整四个大车间，由厂长、总工程师直接领导生产，哪里发生问题，领导人员就到哪里去。这样，解决问题比以前快多了。
    在最近召开的一次关于企业组织机构的座谈会上，大部分纺织厂的代表认为像国棉五厂这样规模在十万枚纱锭以下，只有单一的纺纱和织布车间的厂，都可以不必设工场一级组织。
    现在，上海国棉六厂、十一厂、十六厂等中等规模的厂，也都先后撤销了工场一级组织。
    上海目前一般纺织厂的管理人员都要占到全厂职工总数的15％上下。记者在同一部分纺织厂领导人接触中间，他们普遍谈起管理人员多，除了是因为要为新建纺织厂培养干部以外，现在科室分工太细，也是形成企业机构庞大的重要原因之一。各国营纺织厂无论规模大小，几乎全是十五到十六个科室。例如培训工人发生问题，厂长必须同时找教育科和劳动工资科的负责人一道讨论才能解决。因此，他们认为如果适当合并一些机构，管理人员还可以减少。
