Xinhua News Agency, London, December 7th. The British House of Commons concluded a two-day debate on the government's policy on the Suez Canal issue on the evening of December 6th. Before the end of the debate, the government won a vote of confidence with a majority of 52 votes, 312 votes to 260 votes.

    The Labour Party's amendment condemning the government's policy on the Suez Canal issue for causing "disastrous consequences" was defeated by 327 votes to 260 votes.

    When Bevan made the main speech for the opposition's amendment, he said that the reasons for the government's attack on Egypt had always been contradictory, and none of them were justifiable. Speaking of the government's argument that its actions had promoted the establishment of the United Nations Emergency Force, Bevan said: "If Hitler and Mussolini had thought of this idea at the time, they could have said that they launched a war against the world in order to establish the United Nations."

    Bevan said that if the future of the canal is linked to the withdrawal of British troops, then the United Nations forces stationed in Egypt will no longer be the police force representing the world, but a means of forcing Egypt to accept Britain's conditions regarding the future of the canal.

    After the vote of confidence, Butler, who was acting as Prime Minister, presented a four-point plan for the government's future policy in summarizing the debate. The main points of this plan are: to support the United Nations with strength, to agree with the United States' approach to handling the Middle East situation, not to make the Middle East a battlefield for major wars, but to step up the establishment of an "economic partnership" with Middle Eastern Arab countries.

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th. London News: Despite the House of Commons passing a vote of confidence in the government on the 6th, discussions among British politicians about reshuffling the government have not stopped.

    Reuters commented on the voting situation in the House of Commons on the 6th, saying that the government defeated the Labour Party's impeachment motion with a majority of 67 votes, but only passed the vote of confidence in it with a majority of 52 votes. The reduced 15 votes show that there is a section within the Conservative Party who, while not wanting to stand with the Labour Party, at the same time want to show that they do not approve of the government's policies.

    The news also said: Political figures in London believe that the "defection" of a small number of Conservative MPs openly demonstrates a larger action behind the scenes: changing the government's leadership without causing the government to collapse.

    It has been officially announced that Eden will return to London from Jamaica next week, but even the "Daily Express," which is usually considered to be in favor of Eden, has commented that "in many people's minds, he (Eden) is no longer the Prime Minister."

### 英下院结束苏伊士问题的辩论　工党指责政府的灾难性政策  信任案通过后仍在酝酿倒阁

    英下院结束苏伊士问题的辩论
　　工党指责政府的灾难性政策
    信任案通过后仍在酝酿倒阁
    据新华社伦敦7日电　英国下院12月6日晚上结束了就政府在苏伊士运河问题上的政策所进行的历时两天的辩论。在结束辩论以前，政府在信任投票中以三百十二票对二百六十票的五十二票的多数获得了信任。
    工党所提出的谴责政府在苏伊士运河问题上的政策引起“灾难性的后果”的修正案，以二百六十票对三百二十七票被击败。
    比万在为反对党的修正案作主要发言时说：政府进攻埃及的理由一直都是互相矛盾的，而其中又没有一个是言之有理的。讲到政府所谓由于它的行动才促使联合国成立了联合国部队的这种论调时，比万说：“如果希特勒和墨索里尼当时能够想起这种主意，他们原可以说他们对世界发动战争是为了使联合国成立起来。”
    比万说：如果把运河的前途同英国的撤军联系起来，那么联合国驻埃及的部队就不再是代表世界的警察部队，而成了强迫埃及接受英国关于运河前途的条件的手段。
    信任投票举行以后，代行首相职务的巴特勒在总结辩论时提出了政府今后政策的四点计划。这个计划的要点是：以实力支持联合国，同意美国处理中东局势的做法，不使中东成为大战的战场而是要加紧建立同中东阿拉伯国家的“经济伙伴关系”。
    新华社7日讯　伦敦消息：尽管下院在6日通过了对政府的信任投票，但是英国政界人士关于改组政府的酝酿并没有停止。
    路透社6日评论下院投票情况说，政府以六十七票多数击败了工党的弹劾案，却只有五十二票的多数通过对它的信任案。这减少了的十五票说明：保守党内有这样一部分人，他们虽然不希望同工党站在一起，但同时希望表明他们不赞成政府的政策。
    这条消息还说：伦敦的政界人士相信，一小部分保守党议员的
  “叛变”公开表现了幕后这样一个更大的行动：改变政府领导人员而不使政府垮台。
    官方已经宣布艾登将在下星期从牙买加返回伦敦，但是，连被认为通常是赞成艾登的“每日快报”也发表评论说，“在很多人的头脑里，他（艾登）已经不再是首相了。”
