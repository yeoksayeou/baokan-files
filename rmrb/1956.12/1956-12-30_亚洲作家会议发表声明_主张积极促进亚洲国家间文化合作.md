Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 29th: The Asian Writers' Conference held its closing session on the morning of December 28th, with Mao Dun, head of the Chinese writers' delegation, serving as chairman.

    Dr. Mulk Raj Anand, Secretary-General of the Conference, read out a statement unanimously drafted by the Conference Secretariat. The statement advocated the realization of cultural cooperation among Asian countries through various means, including: striving to acquire knowledge about each other's countries; exchanging cultures; and exchanging information. The statement "hoped that writers of all Asian countries can strive for the realization of these proposals and maintain regular contact with each other to promote the realization of these proposals."

    The statement said: "This Writers' Conference symbolizes the new spirit of a reviving Asia—that is, the spirit of freedom and human dignity; the new awareness of Asia, which is proud of its glorious cultural traditions; and the new determination to build a perfect life, both spiritually and materially rich, for the peoples of Asian countries.

      "Driven by the earnest and sincere desire to promote past cultural ties and develop new ties under the conditions of the modern world, and driven by the assurance to promote friendship, understanding, and peace among each other and among the peoples, countries, and the world of Asia, Asian writers with various viewpoints and various beliefs meet together. We feel that only through the personal meeting of Asian writers and scholars to conduct the freest possible exchanges and exchange of opinions, and mutual exchange of books, can these noble goals be promoted."

    After the statement was read out, all the representatives applauded enthusiastically and stood up and cheered for a long time to express their welcome and approval. When the chairman announced that the statement had been unanimously adopted, another long period of cheers erupted in the hall.

    Then the heads of various delegations spoke at the meeting, congratulating the successful conclusion of the conference. The head of the Myanmar delegation, U Thein Pe Myint, congratulated: "Glory and victory to Asian writers; Long live Asian solidarity; Asia is united; moving towards world peace!"

    Mao Dun said: The Asian Writers' Conference was held in an atmosphere of unity and friendship. It has achieved significant success. Asian writers all recognize that there are differences among them, but these differences have not hindered their unity. This conference has enhanced mutual understanding among Asian writers, and they have learned from each other. Mao Dun especially thanked the Indian friends for their efforts to make the conference a success. Subsequently, Mao Dun presented Chinese books, carpets, and embroidery to the conference, which were accepted by Mulk Raj Anand.

    The head of the Indian delegation, Bengali novelist Tara Sankar Banerjee, said: The Asian Writers' Conference has established the spirit of Asian culture. He said: This culture advocates peace, stopping all wars, and treating each other with friendship and brotherly love.

    When the Egyptian representative, Kamil Hussein, gave a speech, the audience warmly applauded and stood up to express their respect to the heroic Egyptian people!

    Dr. Nafisi, head of the Iranian delegation, Egasagar Balansuriya, head of the Ceylon delegation, and the heads of other delegations also delivered farewell speeches.

    On the afternoon of December 28th, the Secretariat of the Asian Writers' Conference unanimously adopted the recommendation to appoint a committee composed of five Indian representatives. The committee was entrusted to carry out the work of concluding the Asian Writers' Conference, to consult with the various delegations attending the conference, to explore the possibilities of increasing cultural exchanges between the Asian countries participating in the conference, and to draft a report on this issue within six months, which will be circulated to all Asian countries participating in the conference.

    On the same afternoon, the representatives reconvened a very short plenary meeting and approved this decision.
