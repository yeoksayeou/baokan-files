Xinhua News Agency, December 30th, TASS, Cairo, December 30th: The Yemen Embassy in Egypt has issued a statement regarding the aggression against Yemen by British armed forces. The statement says: “Britain continues its aggression against Yemen with the aim of putting pressure on the Yemeni government and intimidating the Yemeni people. To this end, the British have concentrated troops equipped with tanks and armored vehicles in the occupied areas of Yemen and moved troops to the border of free Yemen. British troops are conducting exercises. Military offensives are being launched against cities such as Bayda, Suma, Dalia, and Zubeir."

The statement, referring to the British troops' attack on the city of Qataba on the night of December 24, said: "These British actions violate basic humanitarian laws and blatantly violate the UN Charter. These actions are exacerbating tensions in the Middle East and threatening world peace. Britain's repeated infringements on Yemen at this time amount to a blatant disregard for the UN's efforts to restore and consolidate peace in the Middle East. Yemen firmly protests the unwarranted violence and Britain's use of force to achieve imperialist aims and establish domination over the peoples of various countries."

The statement said: "We call on the United Nations and the entire free world to condemn this barbarous act of the aggressor, to rise up to defend human rights, and to stop the use of force. We call on the United Nations to establish an international commission to investigate and determine the damage caused to Yemen by the aggressor in order to compensate the losses of the residents."

    呼吁联合国谴责英国侵略也门
    新华社30日讯　塔斯社开罗30日讯：也门驻埃及公使馆发表了一项关于英国武装部队侵略也门的声明。声明说：“英国继续侵略也门，其目的是想对也门政府施加压力并且恐吓也门人民。为此，英国人在也门被占领地区内集结了配备有坦克和装甲车的军队，并且把军队调往自由也门的边境。英国军队在进行演习。在向贝达、苏马、达利亚、佐拜尔等城市发动军事进攻。”
    声明在提到英国军队12月24日夜间向卡塔巴城的进攻时说：“英国的这些行为违背了基本的人道法则，粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章。这些行为在加剧中东地区的紧张局势，并且威胁着世界和平。英国在目前一再侵犯也门，等于公然蔑视联合国恢复和巩固中东和平的努力。也门坚决抗议毫无缘由的暴力，抗议英国用武力来实现帝国主义目的和建立对各国人民的统治。”
    声明说：“我们呼吁联合国和整个自由世界谴责侵略者的这种野蛮行为、起来保卫人权和制止采用武力。我们呼吁联合国成立一个国际委员会来调查并且确定侵略者给也门造成的损害，以赔偿居民的损失。”
