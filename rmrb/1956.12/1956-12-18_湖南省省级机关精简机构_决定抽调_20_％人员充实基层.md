Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 16th: The Hunan Provincial People's Committee and the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have decided to first reduce the administrative staff of provincial-level party and government agencies and mass organizations by an average of 20%. Among them, more than 570 cadres with rural work experience or suitable for rural work will be sent to rural areas to strengthen grassroots forces. Another portion of personnel will be directly dispatched by various departments to their affiliated grassroots business or production units.

The work of streamlining agencies at the special district and county levels in Hunan Province is also underway. Pingjiang County, which started the earliest, had already transferred 238 cadres from county-level agencies to work in the countryside on a long-term basis by the 10th, including eight county party committee members and more than 70 cadres at or above the section chief level.

    湖南省省级机关精简机构
    决定抽调20％人员充实基层
    新华社长沙16日电　湖南省人民委员会、中共湖南省委员会决定首先在省级党和政府机关和群众团体中平均削减行政编制人员20％。其中五百七十多名有过农村工作经验或适宜做农村工作的干部，即将被派到各地农村去工作，以加强农村基层力量。另一部分人员将由各厅直接派到所属的基层事业或生产单位去工作。
    湖南省各专区和县一级机关的精简机构工作也正在进行。进行得最早的平江县，已经在10日从县级各机关抽调了二百三十八名干部下乡长期工作，其中有县委委员八人和科长级以上干部七十多人。
