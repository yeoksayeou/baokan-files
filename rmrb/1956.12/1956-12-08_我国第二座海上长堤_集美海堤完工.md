Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, 7th -- China's second sea causeway built in the Xiamen Strait - the Jimei Causeway, was fully completed on the 6th. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway track-laying train, which has already laid tracks to Xinglin Village at the western end of the Jimei Causeway, will soon lay steel rails across this 2,820-meter-long causeway with a top width of 11.53 meters, reaching Jimei Town, and then proceed to Xiamen Station via the Xiamen Causeway connecting Xiamen Island and the mainland.

The Jimei Causeway began construction in October 1955. The entire project used 2 million tons of granite. Its completion has shortened the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway by 8.8 kilometers compared to the original planned route.

　　我国第二座海上长堤——集美海堤完工
    新华社厦门7日电　建筑在厦门海峡中的我国第二座海上长堤——集美海堤，已在6日全部完工。已经铺轨到集美海堤西头杏林村的鹰厦铁路铺轨列车，很快就要把钢轨铺过这座长二千八百二十公尺、顶宽十一点五三公尺的海堤，到达集美镇，再经过连接厦门岛和大陆的厦门海堤，向厦门车站前进。
    集美海堤是在1955年10月开工的。全部工程使用的花岗石达二百万吨。它的建成使鹰厦铁路比原订线路缩短了八点八公里。
