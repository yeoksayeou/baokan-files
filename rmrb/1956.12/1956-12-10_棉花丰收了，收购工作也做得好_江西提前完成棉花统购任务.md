Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 8th. Jiangxi Province, which did not produce cotton before liberation, has provided the state with more and better cotton this year than last year. According to statistics from Jiangxi's cotton unified purchase units, as of the end of November, more than 301,000 dan of ginned cotton had been purchased, an increase of 144.9% over the same period last year. The state's cotton unified purchase target has been completed one month ahead of schedule. The quality of cotton is also relatively good, with middle-grade and above accounting for 79%, of which superior and near-superior grades account for 43.7%.

Because the method of moisture subsidy was implemented in quality inspection, the moisture content of the cotton purchased this time was reduced compared with last year. According to investigations in Leping, Xingan, Pengze, Jiujiang and other counties, the moisture content of cotton was reduced by 3% to 4% compared with last year, which reduced the difficulty of national storage. After the implementation of the moisture subsidy method, cotton farmers have increased their income and are very satisfied.

This year, Jiangxi's cotton harvest is abundant, with output increasing from 183,000 dan last year to 383,000 dan.

    棉花丰收了，收购工作也做得好
　　江西提前完成棉花统购任务
    新华社南昌8日电　解放前不产棉花的江西省，今年已经为国家提供了比去年更多更好的棉花。据江西棉花统购单位统计，截至11月底止，已经收进皮棉三十万一千多担，比去年同期增加144.9％。国家棉花统购指标已经提前一个月完成。棉花质量也比较好，中级以上的占79％，其中上级、次上级占43.7％。
    由于在验级上执行了水分补贴的办法，使这次收购的棉花含水量比去年减少，据乐平、新淦、彭泽、九江等县调查，棉花含水率都比去年减少3％到4％，这就减少了国家保管上的困难。执行水分补贴办法后，棉农增加收入，也都很满意。
    今年江西棉花丰收，产量由去年的十八万三千担，增加到三十八万三千担。
