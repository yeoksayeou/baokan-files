"Good Fortune" and "Bad Luck"
    A brand-new electric motor was shipped from the Shanghai office of the First Ministry of Machine Building's Sales Bureau to the Wuhan Yangtze River Shipping Bureau. The Yangtze River Shipping Bureau had not ordered an electric motor, and when they wrote to inquire, the letter disappeared without a trace. A year later, the machine was still waiting to be claimed.

    Two months ago, the Shenyang Transformer Factory also sent a transformer to the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau. The Yangtze River Shipping Bureau had not ordered a transformer either, and when they wrote to inquire, the letter similarly disappeared without a trace.

    The Yangtze River Shipping Bureau is truly "fortunate"—others want electric motors and transformers but can't get them; they don't need them, yet they are delivered one after another. Unfortunately, the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau does not need this kind of "good fortune," while the true owners of these two machines are really having "bad luck."

    “福气”和“晦气”
    一台崭新的电动机从第一机械工业部销售局上海办事处运到武汉长江航运局来。长江航运局并没有订过电动机，写信去问，石沉大海。事隔一年，机器还待人认领。
    两个月前，沈阳变压器厂也给长江航运局送来一台变压器。长江航运局也没有订过变压器，写信去问，同样是石沉大海。
    长江航运局“福气”真好，别人要电动机，要变压器，要不到；他们并不需要，却一台一台送上门来。可惜的是，长江航运局并不需要这种“福气”，这两台机器的真正的主人，却是够“晦气”的。
