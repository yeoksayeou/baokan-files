Xinhua News Agency, December 1st dispatch from New York: Vice Admiral Brown, commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, stated on November 30th that his fleet is prepared for war.

Brown said that the entire Middle East situation affects the fleet under his command. He also described the situation there as if someone were about to launch an attack on the United States. He said, "I feel like I am sitting on top of a volcano, very anxious. My Pearl Harbor event might happen tomorrow."

    美国唯恐天下不乱
　　第六舰队作好战争准备
    据新华社1日讯　纽约消息：美国第六舰队的司令布朗海军中将11月30日表示，他的舰队已经作好应付战争的准备。
    布朗说，全中东的局势都对他所指挥的舰队有影响。他还把那里的局势说成是仿佛有谁要向美国发动进攻。他说：“我好像坐在火山顶上非常焦急。明天可能就发生我的珍珠港事件。”
    这个在地中海东部领导美国海军“演习”的美国将军反而说什么苏联的海军力量的加强“威胁”了他的供应线。
