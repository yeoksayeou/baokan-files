Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: The representatives attending the Second Member Representatives' Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, after listening to Vice Premier Chen Yun's report, clarified the Party and the state's policies, and further enhanced their enthusiasm for participating in socialist construction and accepting socialist transformation.

　　Yesterday and this morning, after discussing Vice Premier Chen Yun's report, representatives from various regions proposed further standards for remolding themselves. Representatives from Shanghai, Sichuan, Tibet, Yunnan, and Guizhou proposed some standards, such as: loving the motherland and cherishing state property; taking the initiative to improve production and contributing their abilities without reservation; treating workers with a correct attitude and caring about their lives and welfare; strengthening learning and striving to transform their thinking; not being afraid of setbacks and always being proactive, etc. Representatives from Jiangxi Province proposed that private personnel in joint ventures should treat the enterprise as their home and establish a proactive and responsible spirit; they should improve their relationship with public representatives and employees to jointly run the enterprise well; they should share weal and woe with the workers and always care about the lives of employees; they should eliminate suspicion and be open and honest in public-private cooperation. Xu Yunshan, a representative from Hebei Province, based on the current ideological state of industrialists and businessmen, proposed several goals, such as overcoming individualism, liberalism, a guest mentality, an inferiority complex, and being consistent in words and deeds, as efforts to be made. Many representatives are also actively brewing conditions after the meeting, preparing to put forward standards.

　　Representatives from various regions focused on discussing the issue of public-private partnership. Many representatives from Shaanxi, Hebei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, Henan and other places believed that a good relationship between private personnel and employees is indeed the key to a successful public-private partnership. They believe that in the past, the poor relationship with workers and the incorrect views of private personnel towards employees were important reasons. Representatives Wang Mingfu and Xiong Bingli from Hunan Province said that some private personnel look down on the working masses, believing that they have technology and management experience, and do not accept the opinions of employees. Some representatives said that private personnel often feel inferior when they encounter difficulties in their work and are unwilling to approach employees, and some even treat workers with a bad attitude, which greatly hinders a good cooperative relationship. Ju Hongcai and Meng Zemin, representatives from Heilongjiang Province, and Kong Zhizhai, a representative from Shaanxi Province, used their own personal experiences to illustrate that as long as private personnel work actively for the interests of the enterprise and the country, constantly contact workers, and discuss issues together, the relationship with employees can be improved. Many people also put forward some methods for improving cooperative relations in the future. Some representatives from Tianjin proposed that establishing good cooperative relations with employees should be one of the main conditions for private personnel's socialist competition. Dong Yishi, a representative from Hebei Province, said that private personnel should learn from the working attitude and sincerity of the workers, and learn from the public representatives the point of view of handling affairs from the interests of the country and the people. Jiang Jianbai, a representative from Hunan Province, proposed that private personnel who understand production technology and have management experience should help public representatives solve technical problems and familiarize themselves with production management, and help workers improve their technical level.

　　Through discussions, representatives from various regions have begun to realize that large, medium, and small industrial and commercial enterprises have different positions and roles. Many representatives believe that the unity of large, medium, and small industrialists and businessmen should be strengthened on the basis of unified understanding. Some representatives suggested holding forums jointly attended by large, medium, and small industrialists and businessmen to achieve mutual understanding and greater unity through criticism and self-criticism.

    工商联会员代表大会进行热烈讨论
    代表们纷纷提出改造自己的标准
    新华社18日讯　出席全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会的代表，在听了陈云副总理的报告后，明确了党和国家的政策，进一步提高了参加社会主义建设和接受社会主义改造的积极性。
    昨天和今天上午，各地代表在讨论陈云副总理的报告后，纷纷提出了进一步改造自己的标准。上海、四川、西藏、云南、贵州的代表提出了一些标准，例如：热爱祖国、爱护国家财产；主动积极搞好生产，无保留地贡献出自己的能力；以正确态度对待工人，关心和重视工人的生活福利；加强学习，努力改造思想；不怕碰钉子，始终积极等。江西省代表提出，合营企业的私方人员，应该以企业为家，树立积极负责的精神；要改善和公方代表、职工的关系，共同把企业办好；要同工人同甘共苦，随时关心职工的生活；要消除怀疑思想，在公私共事中做到开诚相见。河北省代表许蕴珊根据工商业者目前的思想状况，提出了要克服个人主义、自由主义、作客思想、自卑思想和做到言行一致等几条，作为努力目标。不少代表在会后还积极酝酿条件，准备提出标准。
    各地代表着重讨论了公私共事关系问题。陕西、河北、湖南、江西、黑龙江、河南等地的许多代表都认为私方人员和职工搞好关系的确是搞好公私共事的关键。他们认为过去和工人的关系搞不好，私方人员对职工存在着不正确的看法是一个很重要的原因。湖南省代表王明富、熊炳立说，有些私方人员瞧不起职工群众，认为自己有技术有管理经验，对职工的意见不接受。有的代表说，私方人员工作上遇到一些困难就常常自卑起来，不愿接近职工，有的人更以不好的态度对待工人，这对搞好共事关系都有很大的妨碍。黑龙江省代表鞠洪才、孟泽民，陕西省代表孔直斋都以自己的亲身体验说明只要私方人员为企业、为国家利益积极工作，不断和工人接触，共同商量问题，和职工的关系是可以搞好的。许多人还提出了今后改进共事关系的一些办法。天津市有的代表提出要把和职工搞好共事关系作为私方人员社会主义竞赛的主要条件之一。河北省代表董益石说，私方人员要学习工人的劳动态度和诚朴的作风，要向公方代表学习一切从国家人民利益出发的观点来处理事务。湖南省代表江坚白提出，懂得生产技术和有管理经验的私方人员，应该帮助公方代表解决技术上的问题和熟悉生产管理情况，帮助工人提高技术水平。
    各地代表通过讨论，已开始认识到大、中、小工商业各有不同的地位和作用。许多代表认为应该在统一认识的基础上，加强大、中、小工商业者的团结，有的代表建议召开一些大中小工商业者共同参加的座谈会，通过批评自我批评达到互相了解，更加团结。
