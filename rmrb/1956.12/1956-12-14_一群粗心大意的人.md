In September, I met Captain Liu of the Chengdu Municipal Criminal Police Brigade. He said that citizens on the streets are strictly preventing thieves from running rampant and are doing a good job in assisting public security personnel in solving cases. However, some organizations and their staff are careless; some lose property, and some lose documents; even when it's sent to their door, they don't know. To illustrate the true situation, Captain Liu cited several theft cases that occurred this year as examples.

(1)

On the night of February 9th this year, at around ten o'clock, a resident named Tang Deming discovered an ownerless large wooden box on Huanhouhou Street. He immediately asked the security committee members on the street to report it to the local public security station. The police station then notified the criminal police brigade, who brought the box back. Upon opening it, it was truly "Confucius moving house – full of books." Upon closer inspection, there were also several documents inside, marked with "Party documents, not allowed to be disseminated," and labeled "Confidential." From the official seals and names written on some of the books, it was found that the owner was Du Huaxiang of the Southwest Railway Second Engineering Bureau. They immediately notified the owner to come and claim it. When the owner arrived, the comrades of the criminal police team asked:

"What did you lose?"

"Books."

"Were there any Party documents?"

"I don't know."

How was this box lost? Du Huaxiang was the former Deputy Political Commissar of the Ninth Engineering Section of the Engineering Bureau. He came to Chengdu in December of last year and stayed at the Engineering Bureau's guest house. When he left, he did not clear the documents from the box and left the box at the home of a staff member surnamed Chen across the hall. Several families lived in this courtyard. Lin Zhaoyuan, originally a rogue soldier, had concealed firearms and had been sentenced to imprisonment. He found the Chen family's wooden box was large and heavy, and determined that there must be valuable items inside. So, taking advantage of the fact that there was no one in Chen's house, he moved the box into the alley, opened it, and was greatly disappointed. Apart from a pair of rubber shoes, it was all books. He dropped the box and left with the rubber shoes. The city criminal police team solved the case based on these rubber shoes.

On April 4th this year, the police officers of the Zongfu Street Police Station convened a meeting of the owners of nine pawnshops. The owner of the Guangda Pawnshop said at the meeting:

"Since last year, a person has often come to pawn valuable woolen fabrics. Sometimes he says the fabric is his own, sometimes he says it was brought from Tibet by a friend who asked him to pawn it. Initially, he said his name was Zhang Xinguang, but later he said it was Huang Tianqing. Once we even saw him wearing a department store badge on his chest. Where did these fabrics come from? It's very suspicious."

The comrades at the police station told the owner of the Guangda Pawnshop to pay attention to this person and sent someone to inquire at the personnel department of the department store. They searched through the list of employees of the department store but could not find this person. They asked the department store, "Have you lost any valuable woolen fabrics?" The answer was very straightforward: "I don't know."

One day, the person who pawned the woolen fabric came again with a piece of fabric. The owner immediately notified the police station. The comrades from the police station followed him, and that person walked into the Chunxi Road Department Store, then went to the dining hall to eat. Upon inquiry, it was found that this person was Yao Pingzhang, a window designer in the sales department.

The person in charge of the Chunxi Road sales department was shocked when he heard this news and made a full inventory of all the woolen fabrics. After the investigation, it was found that various valuable woolen fabrics, worth about 19,000 yuan, were missing.

Of course, it cannot be said that all the missing woolen fabrics were stolen by Yao Pingzhang. After a careful investigation by the criminal police team at various pawnshops, the woolen fabrics stolen by Yao Pingzhang were only worth more than 400 yuan. So, where did the other woolen fabrics go? It is still unknown.

Yao Pingzhang was responsible for the window design of the two largest sales departments of the department store, but it is not surprising that he only stole from the Chunxi Road sales department. When the People's South Road sales department issued Yao Pingzhang the woolen fabric for window design, they had to specify the date and size. When returning it, they had to check and accept it. When Yao Pingzhang received the woolen fabric at the Chunxi Road sales department, he was given as much as he wanted, regardless of the size, only the number of pieces. It was fine to return one piece for each piece taken. As for whether one piece of fabric could be cut into several pieces, whether the piece taken was large, and the piece returned was small, the person in charge of the woolen fabric never cared about it. However, thieves understand these things very well.

On the morning of August 8th this year, personnel from the Second Guest House of the Tibet Military Region's Sichuan Liaison Office rushed to the police station to report that a theft had occurred. Criminal police team personnel immediately went to investigate. The situation was as follows: A lieutenant staff officer lost a black leather bag containing more than 1,000 yuan in cash, a remittance of 4,800 yuan, and, more seriously, more than 40 blank letterheads with the official seal of a certain division headquarters and letterheads and stationery with the unit's serial number. A company instructor lost eight commemorative medals for the Huaihai, Crossing the Yangtze, and Liberation of North China, Northwest China, and Southwest China campaigns. In addition, they also lost military caps, uniforms, teacups, and other items. The night before, they went to see a movie, and when they returned, they found that someone had opened the door and the boxes. Obviously, this case was extremely serious. With these items, the thief's fraud capital would be much more substantial than that of the big swindler Li Wanming!

The criminal police team personnel investigated the scene and determined that the theft was committed by a thief living inside the guest house. So, they asked the director and political commissar of the guest house who was staying there.

"I don't know."

"Is there a registration book?"

"No."

"Is there a visitor system?"

"No."

It turned out that the gate of this guest house was open, truly refusing no one. Anyone could walk around freely, and even stay for a few days for free. A group of people left that day, but they couldn't say who they were or where they went. Under these circumstances, even the most capable criminal police team personnel felt it was difficult.

Two months later, the Lanzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested a thief. Because the case was related to Chengdu, they sent a material. According to the material, the thief's name was Sun Hongqing, formerly a soldier in the Tibet Military Region. He had been sentenced to several years in prison for repeated theft and desertion with a gun. In June of this year, Sun Hongqing escaped from prison and lived freely in the Second Guest House of the Tibet Military Region's Sichuan Liaison Office. On the very night he entered the guest house, he stole the officers' belongings, and the next morning he sorted out the stolen goods and calmly left Chengdu with the people who left that day. Then he put on a military uniform, wore commemorative medals on his chest, filled out a few blank letterheads at will, and began his fraud activities.

Neither the director nor the political commissar of the guest house, nor even the general staff, could have imagined that they had entertained this thief in vain and caused them so much trouble.

Enough, there's no need to write more. These examples are enough to illustrate the serious situation of carelessness on the part of these organizations and their staff. The ancients said, "It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost." Organizations that have discovered the loss of documents and property should formulate systems to prevent them in the future.

    一群粗心大意的人
    本报记者　李策
    9月间，我碰见了成都市刑警大队的刘队长。他说现在街道上的市民严防盗窃分子胡作非为，协助公安人员破案成绩很好。可是有些机关和机关工作人员倒是粗心大意，有的丢了财物，有的丢了文件；给他送上门去，他还不知道。为了说明真情实况，刘队长举出了今年发生的几件盗窃案作例子。
    （一）
    今年2月9日夜间十点钟的光景，居民唐德明在桓候后街发现有一口无主的大木箱，他立刻叫街道上的治安委员报告当地公安派出所。派出所又通知刑警大队，刑警大队把箱子搬回来，打开一看，真是“孔夫子搬家——尽是书”。再仔细检查，里边还有几份文件，标着“党内文件，不许外传”，外加“机密”等字。从部分书本上盖的公章和写的名字，看出失主是西南铁路第二工程局的杜华庠，于是立刻通知失主前来认领。失主来了，刑警队的同志问：
    “你丢的是些什么东西？”
    “书。”
    “有没有党的文件。”
    “不知道。”
    这口箱子是怎样遗失的呢？杜华庠是原工程局第九工程段的副政委。去年12月来成都，住在工程局的招待所。临走时，没有把文件从箱子里清出来，就把箱子放在对门一家姓陈的职工家属那里。这个院子住了几户人家。林兆元，原来是个兵痞，隐瞒过枪只，被判过徒刑，他发现陈家这口木箱又大又重，判定里边一定是贵重物品。于是他趁着陈家屋里没有人，把箱子搬到巷子里，打开一摸，大失所望，除一双胶鞋外都是些书。他把箱子丢下，带上胶鞋走了。市刑警队人员就是在这双胶鞋身上破案的。
    （二）
    今年4月4日，总府街派出所民警召集九家寄卖行老板开会。光大寄卖行的老板在会上说：
    “从去年起，有个人时常来寄卖贵重呢料，有时说呢料是自己的，有时说是朋友从西藏带来托他寄卖的。最初说他叫张信光，后来又说叫黄天庆，有次还看见他胸前挂着百货公司的证章。这些呢料，到底是从那儿弄来的，很值得怀疑。”
    派出所的同志告诉光大寄卖行老板留意这个人，同时派人去百货公司人事科查问。翻遍了百货公司职工的名单也查不出这个人。问百货公司“你们丢了贵重的呢料没有？”回答很干脆：“不知道”。
    一天，这个寄卖呢料的人，又带上一块呢料来了。老板立刻通知派出所。派出所的同志跟着他，那个人走进了春熙路百货公司门市部，接着进饭堂吃饭去了。一打听，这个人原是门市部橱窗设计人员姚平章。
    春熙路门市部的负责人听到这个消息，才大吃一惊，把全部呢料来个大盘存。清查结果，发现遗失了各种贵重呢料，约值一万九千多元。
    当然不能说这些遗失的呢料，都是姚平章偷走的。经过刑警队在各个寄卖行仔细调查，姚平章偷走的呢料只值四百多元。那末其他那些呢料那儿去了呢？到现在也没有下落。
    姚平章负责百货公司两个最大的门市部的橱窗设计，可是他单单偷春熙路门市部的，说来并不奇怪。人民南路的门市部发给姚平章做橱窗设计的呢料时，要注明日期、尺寸；交还时，要检收。姚平章在春熙路门市部领呢料是要多少给多少，不计尺寸，只论块数。领去一块，还回来是一块就行。至于一块呢料可以截成几块，拿去的一块是大的，还回来的一块可能是小的，这一点管呢料的人是一概不曾计较的。然而，盗窃犯是很懂得这些的。
    （三）
    今年8月8日上午，西藏军区驻川办事处第二招待所人员，慌慌张张跑到派出所报告，说是发生了盗案。刑警队人员立刻前去调查。事情是这样的：有个少尉参谋，遗失一个黑色皮包，内有现款一千多元、汇票四千八百元，更严重的是，还有盖有某师司令部关防的空白信笺四十多张和带有部队番号的信笺、信纸。有个连队指导员遗失了淮海、渡江等历次战役和解放华北、西北、西南等等八枚纪念章。另外，他们还遗失了军帽、军装、茶缸等物。他们头天晚上去看电影，回来就发现有人把门打开了，把箱子打开了。显然这个案情是异常重大的，盗窃犯拿上这些东西，他的诈骗的资本，比大骗子李万铭还雄厚得多哩！
    刑警队人员侦察了现场，断定这是住在招待所里边的盗窃犯干的，于是询问招待所的主任和政委，住在招待所的是些什么人。
    “不知道。”
    “有登记簿子没有？”
    “没有。”
    “有会客制度没有？”
    “没有。”
    原来这个招待所的大门是敞开的，真正是来者不拒，无论什么人都可以自由走来走去，甚至可以免费住上几天。当天走了一批人，是些什么人，往那儿去的，他们也答不出。在这种情况下，刑警队再高明的人员，也感到为难了。
    过了两个来月，兰州市公安局逮捕了一个盗窃犯。因为案情与成都有关，寄来一份材料。从材料上看，这个盗窃犯叫孙宏庆，原是西藏军区的战士，因为屡次偷窃和携枪潜逃，被判处几年徒刑。今年6月间，孙宏庆从监狱里跑出来，逍遥自在地住在西藏军区驻川办事处的第二招待所里。就在他进招待所的当天晚上，他偷了军官的东西，第二天早上把赃物清理好，从容不迫地随着当天走的人们，离开了成都。然后就穿上军装，胸前戴满了纪念章，随意填了几张空白信笺，开始了他的诈骗活动。
    无论招待所的主任也好，政委也好，甚至一般工作人员，料想不到他们白白地招待了这个盗窃犯，还给他们惹出这么多麻烦。
    够了，用不着再多写了。这些例子足以说明这些机关和工作人员粗心大意的严重情况。古人说：“亡羊补牢，未为晚也”，发现遗失文件、财物的机关，今后就应该定出制度加以防范了。（附图片）
