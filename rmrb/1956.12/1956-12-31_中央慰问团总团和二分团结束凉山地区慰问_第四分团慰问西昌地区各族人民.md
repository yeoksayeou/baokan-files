Xinhua News Agency, Zhaojue, 28th -- The Central 慰问团 Head Team and Second Sub-Team have concluded their 慰问 activities in the Liangshan area. On the 27th, as they departed Liangshan, several thousand well-wishers gathered outside Zhaojue city, surrounding the 慰问团 members, offering bouquets of flowers, expressing their boundless gratitude and reluctance to part.

The 慰问团 Head Team arrived in Zhaojue on November 19th. During this period, Head of the Team Wang Weizhou led the team members to visit the more than 400 students about to graduate from the CPC Liangshan Prefectural Committee Zhaojue Ethnic Cadre School and the Zhaojue Nanping Agricultural Cooperative. They also held a forum attended by more than 210 working people and Yi ethnic upper-class figures from fourteen counties in the prefecture. The Sichuan Opera Troupe, which accompanied the Head Team to Zhaojue, performed splendid programs for the people of Zhaojue.

After arriving in Liangshan, the Second Sub-Team of the 慰问团 divided into four groups to conduct 慰问 activities in various parts of Liangshan. The footprints of the 慰问团 members were left in all twelve counties of the Autonomous Prefecture.

Xinhua News Agency, Xichang, 29th -- Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Jingqi reports: The Fourth Sub-Team of the Central 慰问团 is currently conducting 慰问 activities in the Xichang Prefecture of Sichuan Province. From late November to the present, the Fourth Sub-Team has successively arrived in twelve counties, and the 慰问 in nine counties has already been completed.

In the areas reached by the 慰问团, crowds of people holding red flags welcomed them everywhere. When the 慰问团 arrived in Muli, located at the eastern end of the Kangzang Plateau, more than 600 people and lamas braved wind and snow to welcome them to Muli County. People treated their dear ones with butter tea and milk dregs, and the Muli Temple lamas also performed the "Jumping God" dance.

The 慰问团 held 慰问 rallies in various places and held forums with working people of all ethnic groups, ethnic upper-class figures, and government cadres. At the meetings, the 慰问团 conveyed the care and 慰问 of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and solicited their opinions and requests regarding the government's work.

At these meetings and during individual visits, people of all ethnic groups in Xichang Prefecture, including Yi, Tibetan, Lisu, Mongolian, Hui, and Miao, spoke enthusiastically, expressing their gratitude for the care brought by the Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In particular, the Yi people, who account for nearly 80% of the prefecture's ethnic minority population, were excited and encouraged by the democratic reforms that began this year. The Yi ethnic upper-class figures also unanimously thanked the Party and the government for their care during the reforms. They unanimously expressed that they would work harder to complete the democratic reform in the Yi areas. At present, democratic reforms have been completed in areas with more than 100,000 people out of the 220,000 Yi population in the entire prefecture, and pilot reforms are also underway in the Tibetan areas.

Along the Anning River Basin was the place where the Red Army passed during the Long March. Huang Juean, the Head of the Fourth Sub-Team of the 慰问团, specially visited the family members of Guoji Xiaoyuedan, who had provided assistance to the Red Army and formed a fraternal bond with Marshal Liu Bocheng at that time, in Mianning. In Huili, the 慰问团 also visited the Han worker Yang Zhengwen, who had introduced the situation to Chairman Mao in those years, and presented him with gifts. The 慰问团 distributed more than 6 million catties of relief grain and more than 40,000 sets of winter clothing in various places. The Sichuan Opera Troupe, Peking Opera Troupe, and Film Team accompanying the team performed for the people of all ethnic groups everywhere, and the 慰问团's medical team provided medical treatment to more than 5,000 people.
