    Ice Sports in Harbin
    Harbin has a freezing period of four to five months every year. The long winter allows the people of Harbin to fully engage in various ice sports. The following is a record of some fragments of ice sports in this city this year.
    Natural Skating Rink – Songhua River
    The calm Songhua River has now frozen into a thick layer of ice. The ferry service that crossed the river in the summer has been replaced by dozens of "ice sledges."
    On this natural skating rink, four "ice slides" (made of boards in a slide shape and then splashed with water to freeze) that are two to three zhang tall have been erected. People often sit on ice sledges and slide down from the top of the high "ice slides" at high speed. This interesting activity can make people more courageous.
    The ice yachting activity, which once attracted tens of thousands of sports enthusiasts, will also begin soon. This year, the Harbin Workers Jiangshang Sports Station has added seven new ice yachts. In addition, three ice yachts operated by a single person and two people have been trial-produced.
    New Achievements of Ice Athletes
    In the smooth as a mirror skating rink of the Harbin People's Stadium, more than 40 outstanding ice athletes from Harbin often brave the severe cold of minus 20 degrees Celsius to conduct intense training here, preparing to participate in the 1957 National Ice Sports Games.
    Recently, during the Harbin skating test, Zheng Hongdao, who won the second place in the 1956 National Men's Speed ​​Skating All-Around, broke the 1956 National Men's 1,500-meter Speed ​​Skating record of 2 minutes 31.6 seconds with a score of 2 minutes 30.8 seconds. Sun Hongxia, who won the third place in the 1956 National Women's Speed ​​Skating All-Around, broke the 1955 National Women's 3,000-meter Speed ​​Skating record of 6 minutes 30.6 seconds with a score of 6 minutes 30.2 seconds. Most other athletes have also improved their scores.
    Children's Figure Skating Team
    In Harbin, not only adults like to skate, but children are also good at skating.
    On the Harbin Children's Skating Rink, there is often a group of innocent and lively children practicing skating. This is the team of the Harbin Children's Figure Skating Team. This children's figure skating team has 100 members, all of whom are skating-loving children aged eight to sixteen. Although they are not very old, many of them have four or five years of skating history. Li Changchun, a thirteen-year-old boy, and Ren Puhua, a girl, can perform complex jumping movements on the ice. Ren Puhua, who is nine years old, is the youngest group leader in this skating team. In the 1955 National Ice Sports Games, she participated in the skating game performance of "Little Cat Fishing." Now, the members of her group can skillfully perform balancing skating, squatting skating, and skating inner and outer blade "8" shapes and other movements.
    The Children's Figure Skating Team has shown its skills in the 1953 and 1955 National Ice Sports Games and the Harbin Ice Sports Games. The skating games they performed, such as "Little Cat Fishing," "Eagle Catching Chickens," and "Proud Little Black Rabbit," were warmly welcomed. Currently, the Harbin Children's Palace instructors are arranging new programs, preparing to let the children participate in the 1957 National Ice Sports Games performance.
    Workers' Ice Hockey Team
    Almost one in four employees of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has a pair of skates. All five or six workshops in the factory have their own ice hockey teams. They often hold friendly matches on the factory's ice rink during lunch breaks or after get off work.
    The factory's ice hockey team is a strong team among the amateur ice hockey teams in Harbin. Several members of this team have been selected as members of the China Railway Sports Association Ice Hockey Team and participated in the National Ice Sports Games. In 1956, this team won the championship of the Harbin Ice Sports Games ice hockey competition.
    In order to enhance their physical strength, the members of this team also persisted in physical exercise in the summer. Since the beginning of winter, they have conducted seven friendly matches with six ice hockey teams including the Harbin Ice Hockey Team and the Harbin Workers Joint Team.

    冰上运动在哈尔滨
    新华社记者　黄沙
    哈尔滨每年都有四、五个月的结冰期。漫长的冬季使哈尔滨市的人民可以尽情地进行着各种各样的冰上体育活动。下面记述的就是这个城市今年冰上运动的一些片段。
    天然的滑冰场——松花江
    平静的松花江现在已经结成厚厚的冰层。夏天过江的摆渡，已经由几十只“冰撬梨”代替了。
    在这个天然的滑冰场上，已经耸立起四座两三丈高的“冰滑梯”（用板搭成滑梯型然后泼上水结成冰），经常有人坐着冰撬从高高的“冰滑梯”顶上疾速地滑下来。这种有趣的活动，可以使人们锻炼得更勇敢。
    曾经吸引过成千上万个体育爱好者的冰帆船活动，不久也要开始了。今年，哈尔滨工人江上运动站又增添了七只新的冰帆船。另外还试制了三只单人操纵和两人操纵的冰帆船。
    冰上运动员的新成绩
    在平滑如镜的哈尔滨人民体育场的滑冰场里，四十几名哈尔滨市的优秀冰上运动员，经常冒着摄氏零下二十多度的严寒在这里进行紧张的锻炼，准备参加1957年全国冰上运动会。
    最近，哈尔滨市举行滑冰测验的时候，获得1956年全国男子速度滑冰全能第二名的运动员郑弘道，以二分三十秒八的成绩，打破了1956年男子一千五百公尺速度滑冰二分三十一秒六的全国纪录。获得1956年全国女子速度滑冰全能第三名的孙洪霞，以六分三十秒二的成绩，打破了1955年女子三千公尺速度滑冰六分三十秒六的全国纪录。其他运动员也大部分提高了自己的成绩。
    少年儿童花样滑冰队
    在哈尔滨，不仅成年人喜欢滑冰，孩子们也是滑冰的好手。
    在哈尔滨的儿童滑冰场上，经常有一群天真活泼的儿童在练习滑冰。这就是哈尔滨少年儿童花样滑冰队的队员。这个少年儿童花样滑冰队有一百名队员，都是八岁到十六岁的爱好滑冰的少年儿童。虽然他们的年纪都不大，但是许多人都有四、五年的滑冰历史了。十三岁的男孩子李长春和女孩子任溥英都能在冰上做复杂的跳跃动作。九岁的任溥华是这个滑冰队里年纪最小的一位小组长。在1955年全国冰上运动大会上，她参加过“小猫钓鱼”的滑冰游戏表演。现在，她领导的小组的组员都能熟练地作平衡滑、蹲腿滑和滑内、外刃“8”字等动作。
    少年儿童花样滑冰队曾经在1953年和1955年全国冰上运动大会和哈尔滨市冰上运动大会显过身手。他们表演的“小猫钓鱼”、“老鹰抓小鸡”和“骄傲的小黑兔”等滑冰游戏，曾经受到热烈欢迎。目前，哈尔滨少年宫辅导员正在编排新的节目，准备让孩子们参加1957年全国冰上运动会表演。
    工人冰球队
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂几乎每四个职工中就有一双冰鞋。全厂五、六个车间都有自己的冰球队。他们经常在午间休息或下班以后，在工厂的冰场上举行友谊比赛。
    这个工厂的冰球代表队是哈尔滨市业余冰球队中的一支劲旅。这个队有好几名队员曾经被选为中国火车头体育协会冰球代表队，参加过全国冰上运动大会。1956年，这个队获得了哈尔滨冰上运动大会冰球赛的冠军。
    这个队的队员为了增强自己的体力，在夏天也坚持体育锻炼。入冬以来，他们已经先后同哈尔滨市冰球代表队、哈尔滨工人联队等六个冰球队进行了七场友谊比赛。
