Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 26th – The Mayor of Bombay, India, Mr. Kader, said at a banquet held in his honor by Tianjin Mayor Huang Huoqing tonight that he hoped that the mayors of major cities around the world would organize an institution to exchange experiences in managing international municipal affairs. He firmly believes that such an institution will greatly promote peaceful coexistence among countries and the development of international friendship. He said, "Every mayor loves his city and his citizens, and once a war breaks out, it is the cities that are first destroyed." Therefore, he believes that the organization of mayors of major cities around the world will be a powerful force for defending peace and preventing war.

Mayor Huang Huoqing said in his welcoming speech: Our two countries have many things in common. In the past century, the people of China and India have jointly suffered from imperialist oppression, which enables us to understand and cooperate on many issues. Bombay and Tianjin also have many things in common. Therefore, Mayor Kader's visit to Tianjin this time will give us the opportunity to learn rich experience in municipal management from him. We will do our best to meet Mayor Kader's requirements and invite him to visit everything he wants to see.

Mayor Kader expressed his sincere gratitude to the host for his hospitality. He said that at the last Bombay City Council meeting before he came to China, when the councilors learned that he was coming here, they all stood up and asked him to convey greetings and respect from the 3.6 million citizens of Bombay to the people of Tianjin and China.

Before the banquet, when Huang Huoqing met with Kader, he accepted Kashmir handicrafts, a photograph of the Bombay Municipal Government, and a booklet introducing the city of Bombay presented by him.

    黄火青举行宴会欢迎孟买市长
    据新华社天津26日电　印度孟买市市长卡德尔今晚在天津市市长黄火青为欢迎他而举行的宴会上说，他希望全世界各大城市的市长组织一个机构，来互相交流管理国际市政的经验。他深信，这种机构对促进各国和平共处和发展国际间的友谊将有很大作用。他说：“每一个市长都爱护他的城市和他的市民，而战争一旦爆发，首先遭到破坏的就是城市。”所以他认为全世界各大城市的市长组织起来，将是保卫和平、制止战争的一支强大的力量。
    黄火青市长致欢迎词说：我们两国有许多共同之点，近百年来，中印两国人民共同受到帝国主义的压迫，这使我们有许多问题能够互相谅解和合作。孟买和天津也有很多共同之点，因此，卡德尔市长这次到天津来访问，我们将有机会向他学习丰富的市政管理经验。我们将尽力满足卡德尔市长的要求。请他参观他所要看的一切地方。
    卡德尔市长十分感谢主人的盛意。他说，在他来中国前的最后一次孟买市议会上，当议员们知道他要到这里来的消息之后，全体起立，要求他为孟买市三百六十万市民向天津和中国的人民致以问候和敬意。
    在宴会以前，黄火青在接见卡德尔时，接受了他所赠送的克什米尔的手工艺品、孟买市政府的像片和一本介绍孟买市的小册子。
