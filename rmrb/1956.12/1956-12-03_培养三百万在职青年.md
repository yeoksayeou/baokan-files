Among the vast number of on-the-job youth in our country, a surge of advancing towards science has recently formed. Many on-the-job youth have set up study plans for learning science, technology, and theoretical culture, seizing their spare time to study diligently; the atmosphere of independent thinking and studying problems is strong.
    Our country's socialist construction is developing rapidly, but the training of talent is not keeping up with the needs. Under the circumstances that our country's universities and various specialized schools cannot develop on a large scale, strengthening the cultivation of on-the-job youth is of particular importance and urgency in order to rapidly train a large number of new scientific and technological cadres and excellent cadres needed for various work.
    Our country currently has three million on-the-job youth with a junior high school education or above. Some of them are engaged in higher education and scientific and technological work and have already achieved certain results; most of the youth engaged in other various jobs also have certain practical work experience. Relevant departments should pay attention to the cultivation of this group of young people, especially universities, scientific, and enterprise departments. In addition to running school education well and doing a good job in the training of graduate students, they should devote a certain amount of effort to strengthening the training of lecturers, teaching assistants, engineering technicians, doctors, nurses, and assistant researchers.
    At present, some on-the-job youth have a very narrow understanding of the path and content of advancing towards science. They believe that advancing means going to school, becoming a graduate student, studying books, and obtaining a degree, and they are not interested in their current work, and even attempt to put down their current work to specialize in doctoral reference books. Some young people also believe that advancing towards science means learning mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and engaging in academic research in natural sciences and social sciences. Therefore, some young people with low levels of education who are engaged in administrative affairs and Party and League work feel that there is nothing to advance towards, and some on-the-job youth even rashly leave their existing foundation to chase "popular" fields. We should understand that the main purpose of the Party Central Committee's call to advance towards science is to develop our country's scientific undertakings and enable the most important and urgently needed scientific departments in our country to catch up with the world's advanced levels as soon as possible. However, the talents needed for building socialism are multifaceted. Science and technology cannot develop in isolation from the level of our country's economic and cultural development. Therefore, in addition to a few people going to universities for further study, most cadres should adhere to their various work positions and should formulate advanced study plans based on current business needs and their own existing level. Through advancing towards science, improve business, improve culture, and become an expert in one's own field. Some on-the-job youth excessively emphasize personal interests and hobbies, so that they are opposed to the current work, which is certainly wrong; however, on the premise of doing a good job in business, on-the-job youth should also be allowed to learn and master a professional knowledge and technology according to their personal interests and hobbies.
    There are many difficulties for on-the-job youth to master modern science and technology and be proficient in their own business. Some young people have not yet determined the direction of advancing towards science due to a lack of necessary guidance; some young people have roughly determined the direction, but cannot develop a specific plan. Some necessary learning conditions, such as books, learning time, and learning environment, also need to be further improved. All agencies and departments should combine the development of business, the training of cadres, and assisting on-the-job youth in further study, and help on-the-job youth develop research topics and further study plans based on the plan for developing business. All agencies and enterprises should strengthen the planning of work, properly arrange various activities, and properly control them, so as to minimize encroachment on young people's spare study time; books, lighting, dormitories, etc., should also be appropriately increased and adjusted, and the supply system and book lending procedures should be improved. Under the principle of implementing simplification and economy, fully utilize the utilization rate of existing equipment.
    On-the-job youth's advancement towards science mainly relies on spare-time self-study. Under possible conditions, all agencies and enterprises should also organize some spare-time learning organizations. According to recent statistics, more than 40 units have applied to the Ministry of Higher Education to run night universities. Some have already started automatically. This shows that our country's universities and enterprise departments still have a certain potential to be tapped in running formal spare-time schools. Education departments and enterprise departments should be proactive in this regard, and should try to run schools if conditions permit without affecting teaching and production. Those who have difficulty running schools independently should jointly run schools with several units with similar characteristics.
    Many units have also organized some semi-formal spare-time learning organizations, such as spare-time study classes. Some of these learning organizations specialize in learning a course based on business needs and the general requirements of young people; some continuously study several courses according to a longer-term plan. Many on-the-job youth in many agencies have automatically organized spare-time study groups, jointly formulated advanced study plans, and focused on self-study, conducting necessary collective discussions and research, and helping each other. The characteristics of these learning organizations are simple and flexible, easy to establish and lead, and do not require much manpower and resources. As long as relevant departments strongly support and send special personnel to guide them, they can achieve good results. This method should be vigorously promoted.
    For most young people, advancing towards science is still a new subject. Some on-the-job youth have set their further study plans too high and too large, and their requirements are too urgent. Several courses are advancing at the same time. They read books all day long, and even squeezed out the time to participate in recreational and sports activities, which made them exhausted and unable to persevere. On the other hand, a few young people are still wandering outside the door of advancing towards science. They want to learn this today and that tomorrow, and they can't make up their minds. Some have set plans, but lack the courage to implement them, and retreat when they encounter difficulties. Party and League organizations at all levels should repeatedly explain to young people that young people should have high ideals, but in learning practice, they must proceed step by step according to existing conditions, the advanced study plan must be realistic, and capturing the scientific fortress cannot be achieved overnight; the implementation of the plan should be focused and dedicated, and go forward bravely, with the will of not being afraid of hardship and tenacious struggle, not only should not look at the height of the West Mountain, resulting in nothing, but also should not shrink back when encountering difficulties. Our ancestors had stories of collecting fireflies in bags, reflecting snow, and stealing light by chiseling walls. This spirit of hard study and overcoming difficulties is worth promoting.
    The advancement of on-the-job youth towards science cannot be separated from the guidance of old experts. In addition to giving play to their own initiative, enthusiasm, independent thinking, and independent research spirit, young people should also humbly learn from old experts and all experienced predecessors. The attitude of arrogance and complacency in learning will only block one's own path forward. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Modesty makes people progress, and arrogance makes people fall behind." Our young people should often review this sentence.
    Excellent cadres engaged in socialist construction should not only have a high degree of scientific and technological and cultural accomplishment, but also must have a Marxist-Leninist world outlook. Only by mastering the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method can we better discover the laws of natural and social phenomena, and can we better master science. Caring about politics, caring about the country and the people's lives, is the excellent quality of young people in socialist countries, and it is also the fine tradition of revolutionary youth in our country. The tendency of only paying attention to science and technology and neglecting the study of Marxism-Leninism, and only paying attention to business and not caring about politics is wrong. In the advance towards science, we must especially promote the style of study that combines theory with practice, and we must pay attention to both theoretical study and investigation and research work.
    Under the long-term care and cultivation of the Party and under the correct leadership of the League organizations, young people in our country have a high degree of political consciousness and a glorious revolutionary tradition. Young people have made great contributions in the successive revolutions in our country. As long as we strengthen leadership and patiently guide them, they will surely make greater contributions to the cause of building socialism and developing science in the country.

    培养三百万在职青年
    在我国广大在职青年中，近来已经形成了一个向科学进军的热潮。许多在职青年定出了学习科学技术和理论文化的进修规划，
  抓紧业余时间认真读书；独立思考和钻研问题的空气浓厚了。
      我国社会主义建设事业发展很快，而人材的培养还赶不上需要。在我国高等学校和各种专业学校还不能大量发展的情况下，要迅速大量地培养出新的科学技术干部和各种工作所需要
  的优秀干部，加强对在职青年的培养是具有特别重要和迫切意
  义的。
    我国现有三百万名具有初中以上文化程度的在职青年，他们中间有些从事高等教育和科学技术工作，已经有了一定的成绩；大多数从事其它各种工作的青年，也已经具有一定的实际工作经验。有关部门应该重视这一部分青年的培养工作，特别是高等学校和科学、企业部门，除了办好学校教育，做好对研究生的培养工作以外，要抽出一定的力量加强对讲师、助教、工程技术人员、医生、护士和助理研究人员的培养。
      目前有些在职青年，对于向科学进军的道路和内容了解的很狭窄。他们认为进军就是进学校、当研究生、啃书本、取得学位，而对当前工作不感兴趣，甚至企图放下现有工作专门读博士参考书。也有些青年认为，向科学进军就是学习数学、物理、化学，就是从事自然科学和社会科学的学术研究工作。因而，有些文化水平低、从事行政事务和党、团工作的青年，感到无所进军，甚至有些在职青年轻率地离开自己现有的基础去赶“热门”。我们应该了解，党中央提出向科学进军的号召，主要目的是为了发展我国科学事业，使我国最重要、最急需的科学部门，尽快地赶上世界先进水平。但是，建设社会主义事业所需要的人材是多方面的。科学技术也不能脱离我国的经济和文化发展的水平而孤立地发展。因此，向科学进军，除了少数人进高等学校深造以外，大多数干部应该坚持各种工作岗位，应当从当前业务需要出发，从自己的现有水平出发，定出进修规划。通过向科学进军，提高业务、提高文化，使自己成为本行本业的内行和专家。有些在职青年过分地强调个人的志趣和爱好，以致把它同当前工作对立起来，这当然是不对的；可是，在做好业务工作的前提下，也应当允许在职青年按照个人的志趣和爱好，去学习和掌握一种专业知识和技术。
    在职青年要掌握近代科学技术和精通自己的业务，困难是不少的。有些青年因为缺乏必要的指导，还没有确定向科学进军的方向；有些青年虽然大体上确定了方向，但定不出具体的规划。一些必要的学习条件，如图书资料、学习时间、学习环境等，也需要进一步加以改善。各机关、各部门要把发展业务、培养干部同帮助在职青年进修的工作结合起来，根据发展业务的计划，帮助在职青年定出研究题目和进修规划。各机关、企业应当加强工作的计划性，妥当安排各种活动，并加以适当控制，做到尽量不侵犯青年的业余学习时间；对图书资料、灯光、宿舍等，也要适当地增加和调剂，改进供应制度和图书出借手续。在贯彻精简节约的原则下，充分发挥现有设备的利用率。
    在职青年向科学进军，主要依靠业余自修。在可能的条件下，各机关、企业也应当举办一些业余学习组织。据最近统计，向高等教育部申请办夜大学的单位已有四十多个。有些已经自动办起来了。这说明我国高等学校和企业部门，在举办正规的业余学校方面，还有一定潜力可以挖掘。教育部门和企业部门，在这方面要积极主动，在不影响教学和生产的前提下，有条件办的就要尽量举办，单独举办有困难的要联合几个性质相近的单位共同举办。
    还有不少单位举办了一些半正规的业余学习组织，如业余学习班等。这些学习组织有的是根据业务需要和青年的普遍要求专门学习一门课程；有的按照较长远的计划连续学习几门课程。还有很多机关的在职青年，自动组织了业余学习小组，共同拟定进修计划，以自修为主，进行必要的集体讨论和研究，互相帮助。这些学习组织的特点是简便灵活，容易建立和领导，且不费多大人力物力，只要有关部门大力支持，派专人指导，就能收到很好的效果。这个办法是应该大力提倡的。
    对大多数青年来说，向科学进军毕竟还是一个新的课题，有些在职青年进修规划定的过高过大，要求过急，几门功课齐头并进，竟日读书，连参加文娱、体育活动的时间也挤掉了，弄得精疲力竭，不能坚持。另一方面，也有少数青年还徘徊在向科学进军的门外，今天想学这门，明天想学那门，拿不定主意。有的虽然定了规划，但缺乏执行的勇气，碰到困难就后退。各级党、团组织应当向青年反复说明，青年应该有很高的理想，但在学习实践中，必须根据现有条件循序渐进，进修规划必须实事求是，夺取科学堡垒不是一朝一夕所能奏效的；执行规划要专心致志，勇往直前，有不畏艰苦、顽强斗争的意志，既不要东山望见西山高，结果弄得一事无成，也不能碰到困难就畏缩不前。我国古人曾有囊萤、映雪、凿壁偷光的故事。这种艰苦攻读、克服困难的精神是值得发扬的。
    在职青年向科学进军，离不开老专家的指导。青年们在学习中除了发挥自己的主动性、积极性、独立思考、独立钻研的精神以外，还应该虚心地向老专家学习，向一切有经验的先辈学习。那种在学习上骄傲自满的态度，只会堵塞自己前进的道路。毛泽东同志说：“谦虚使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。我们青年应当经常温习这句话。
    从事社会主义建设的优秀干部，不仅要有高度的科学技术和文化修养，而且还必须具有马克思列宁主义的世界观。也只有掌握了马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，才能更好地深入发现自然现象和社会现象的规律，才能更好地掌握科学。关心政治、关心国家和人民生活，是社会主义国家青年的优秀品质，也是我国革命青年的优良传统。那种只重视科学技术而忽视马克思列宁主义的学习，只重视业务不关心政治的倾向是不对的。在向科学进军中，特别要提倡理论联系实际的学风，既要重视理论学习，又要重视调查研究工作。
    我国青年在党的长期关怀和培养下，在团组织的正确领导下，是有较高的政治觉悟和光荣的革命传统的。青年在我国历次革命中，都有过很大的贡献。只要我们加强领导，循循善诱，他们在国家建设社会主义和发展科学的事业中，一定会作出更大的贡献。
