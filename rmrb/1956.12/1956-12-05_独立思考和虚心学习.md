　　Independent Thinking and Humble Learning
　　Bai Liao
    Our country's socialist construction requires specialized talents with independent working abilities, and the prerequisite for having independent working abilities is having independent thinking ability. However, in the past few years, due to the shortcomings in the teaching plans, teaching methods, and some systems of higher education institutions, students felt that the study burden was too heavy, and the development of their independent thinking ability was not as normal as it should have been. To change this situation, since the beginning of this semester, various universities have revised their teaching plans, improved their teaching methods, and allowed students to freely arrange their spare time. These new measures have brought a new look to the students' studies. More people are reading reference books outside of class; a strong interest in scientific research has developed, and a trend of boldly raising questions and debating issues has begun to take shape. The phenomenon of rote memorization, uncritical acceptance, and "moving notes" in classroom discussions has decreased.
    However, many students do not fully understand what independent thinking means and how to cultivate it, and some have even misunderstood it. Some students believe that independent thinking means "thinking and learning by oneself," so they do not pay attention to the teacher's lectures, do not review carefully after class, do not complete assignments well, and are unwilling to ask teachers or classmates about things they cannot figure out on their own. Some students believe that independent thinking means raising different opinions on a certain issue, so they do not first study the content taught by the teacher and the assigned reference books, but instead rush to browse a large number of extracurricular reference books, and even completely ignore regular class learning and try to do something completely different, hoping to make a splash. Still other students, in order to "cultivate" their independent thinking ability, specifically pay attention to picking out certain flaws in the teacher's lectures, and even express dissatisfaction when the teacher asks students to memorize a certain basic concept in class.
    Science is a matter of honest learning, and no amount of playfulness is allowed. If we can think calmly about it, we will realize that the above-mentioned way of treating independent thinking is obviously incorrect, and it is not only not beneficial to our learning, but also harmful. To truly cultivate one's independent thinking ability, one must learn humbly. Only by humbly learning from teachers, listening carefully to lectures, conducting experiments conscientiously, reviewing diligently, and completing the assignments assigned by teachers with earnestness, can students acquire basic knowledge. Only on this basis can further achievements be made through independent thinking. The basic principle of seeking knowledge is to proceed step by step. If the basic courses in the lower grades are not well learned, it is futile to study the courses in the higher grades. Teachers, even young teachers, have generally put in more effort in learning than students, and their accumulation of knowledge is also greater. By learning humbly, students can accept the knowledge imparted by teachers, and at the same time, they can learn the teacher's independent thinking methods. If some students, merely for the sake of "cultivating" their independent thinking ability, insist on doing useless thinking, or even make trouble under the guise of "independent thinking," then, for them, the result is only wasting their precious time. The students who humbly learn are moving forward, while he will be left behind in the learning ranks, leaving only regret. Humble learning, in addition to meaning that students should humbly learn from teachers, naturally also includes the meaning that students should humbly learn from each other.
    Students should humbly learn from teachers, but this does not mean that students cannot raise questions about the content taught by teachers. In the learning process, students can humbly raise questions to teachers, express their opinions, and even argue with teachers, all of which is perfectly acceptable, based on a realistic and truth-seeking attitude. By doing so, students can achieve the goal of digesting the course content, and they can also cultivate independent thinking ability. However, even if students have genuine new insights on a certain issue that are better than the teacher's, there is no reason not to learn humbly.
    In the process of humbly learning, in order to learn better and to better cultivate independent thinking ability, students can also kindly propose hopes for improvement and make concrete suggestions based on facts regarding the teaching plan, teaching methods, and any teaching measures of teachers. Teachers will certainly welcome such practices. However, students must consider that the teacher's teaching process is also a process of independent thinking, and the teacher's independent thinking ability is also constantly improving, so the hopes or suggestions put forward by students must take into account reality, must be possible to do, and must be actually needed.
    In order to better guide students to correctly cultivate independent thinking ability, it is hoped that the Communist Youth League organizations in universities will do some work in this regard that can be done. For those students who are not good at learning humbly, the Communist Youth League organizations can try to help them correct their attitudes, inspire them to love their major, and cultivate the spirit of persistent and hard work. On this basis, the Communist Youth League organizations can inspire students to understand how to cultivate independent thinking ability through document study or discussion meetings guided by teachers. The Communist Youth League organizations can also guide students to be good at raising questions, expressing their own opinions, and bravely participating in beneficial debates in their studies. Regarding students' difficulties, requirements, opinions, etc. in learning, the Communist Youth League organizations can promptly reflect them to the school administration or to the teachers, so as to create more and better conditions for cultivating students' independent thinking ability.
    The cultivation of independent thinking ability requires a difficult and long-term process. Through humble learning, students will gradually improve their independent working ability.

### 独立思考和虚心学习

　　独立思考和虚心学习
　　白辽
    祖国的社会主义建设需要有独立工作能力的专门人材，而具有独立工作能力的先决条件是具有独立思考能力。可是，以往几年由于高等学校的教学计划、教学方式和一些制度上的缺点，使学生感到学习负担过重，影响学生的独立思考能力没有得到应有的正常的发展。为了改变这种情况，这学期开学以来，各高等学校修改了教学计划，改进了教学方式，让学生自由支配课余时间。这些新的措施使学生们的学习出现了新的面貌。课外读参考书籍的人增多了；对科学研究产生了浓厚的兴趣，并且开始树立了大胆提出问题和争论问题的风气。呆读死记、生吞活剥、在课堂讨论上“笔记搬家”的现象减少了。
    可是怎样叫做独立思考和如何培养独立思考能力，不少学生对它的理解还不完全正确，甚至产生了误解。有的学生认为，独立思考就是“自己思、自己学”，因而不注意教师的讲课，课后不认真复习、不很好地完成作业，自己想不通的地方也不愿意去问教师或者问同学。有的学生认为，要对某一问题提出不同的看法才叫做独立思考，因而不先钻研教师讲授的内容和指定的参考书，忙于去大量翻阅课外的参考书，甚至根本忽视正课学习，而去另搞一套，企图一鸣惊人。还有的学生为了“培养”自己的独立思考能力，就专门注意挑教师讲授中的某些毛病，甚至当教师在课堂上提出要求学生记住某一基本概念时，有的也表示不满。
    科学是老老实实的学问，对它任何一点调皮都是不行的。假如我们能够冷静地思考一下，就会认识到像上面所说的那样对待独立思考，显然是不正确的，对自己的学习不但没有什么好处，反而有坏处。要真正培养自己的独立思考能力，就要虚心学习。学生只有虚心地向教师学习，认真听讲，认真实验，认真复习，认真完成教师指定的作业，才可能获得基本的知识。在这个基础上，才可能通过独立思考取得进一步的成绩。求学问的基本原则是循序渐进。如果低年级的基础课没有学好，就去钻研高年级的课程，也是徒劳无功的。教师，即使是年青的教师，在学习上总比学生多下过工夫，知识的积累也要多些，学生通过虚心的学习，可以接受教师传授给的知识，同时可以知道教师的独立思考方法。如果有的学生，仅仅为了“培养”自己的独立思考能力，而硬去作无益的思考，甚至借“独立思考”为名无理取闹，那么，对他来说，结果只是浪费掉大好光阴。虚心学习的同学们前进了，而他将被抛在学习队伍的后面，徒留后悔。虚心学习除了指学生要向教师虚心学习，自然也包含着学生之间要互相虚心学习的意思。
    学生要虚心向教师学习，并不等于说学生不可以对教师讲授的内容提出疑问。在学习过程中，学生尽可以本着实事求是的态度，虚心地向教师提出疑问，提出自己的意见，甚至同教师进行争辩也是完全可以的。这样做，学生可以达到消化课程内容的目的，也可以培养独立思考能力。但是，即使学生在某一问题上比教师有了真正的新的见解，也没有理由不虚心学习。
    学生在虚心学习的过程中，为了学习得更好，为了能更好地培养独立思考能力，对教学计划、教学方法以及教师教学上的任何措施，也可以善意地提出改进的希望，实事求是地提出具体的建议。教师对于这样的做法也一定是欢迎的。但是学生们要考虑到，教师的教学过程也是独立思考的过程，而且教师的独立思考能力也还正在不断提高的过程中，所以学生们提出的希望或建议必须估计到现实性，必须是可能办到的而且是实际所需要的。
    为着更好地引导学生去正确地培养独立思考能力，希望高等学校里的青年团组织做好这方面的一些可以做的工作。对于那些不善于虚心学习的学生，青年团组织可以设法帮助他们端正态度，启发他们热爱自己的专业，培养坚持不懈的刻苦钻研精神。在这一基础上，青年团组织可以通过文件学习或有教师参加指导的讨论会，启发学生们认识如何培养独立思考能力。青年团组织还可以引导学生们在学习中善于提出问题，提出自己的见解，并且勇于参加有益的争论。对于学生们在学习上的困难、要求、意见等等，青年团组织可以及时向学校行政上或向教师反映，为培养学生独立思考能力创造更多、更好的条件。
    独立思考能力的培养，需要经过艰苦的、长期的过程。学生们通过虚心的学习，一定会日渐提高自己的独立工作能力。
