Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 5th: State Department Press Officer White told reporters on December 4th that the United States "will sympathetically consider" Britain's suggestion to waive the interest due on a loan to Britain and will submit the suggestion to Congress for discussion.

(Editor's note) Due to financial and economic difficulties, the British government has requested the United States to allow it to only repay the principal due this year and waive the interest payment.

At the end of 1945, Britain borrowed 3.75 billion US dollars from the United States, plus 600 million US dollars in debts from the Lend-Lease Agreement and Mutual Aid during World War II. According to the agreement, both debts are to be repaid in installments of principal and interest annually starting from 1951, to be cleared within fifty years. In the past five years, Britain has paid both principal and interest as scheduled, and the remaining debt balance is 4.06 billion US dollars. On December 31 this year, Britain has to repay 140 million US dollars in principal and interest, of which interest amounts to 82.2 million US dollars.

Britain's debt burden is a result of the Second World War. Now, the war of aggression against Egypt has made it impossible for Britain to even pay the interest.

According to the agreement, Britain can request a waiver of interest when "the Government of the United Kingdom finds that, in view of the current and prospective international exchange situation and the amount of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, such a waiver is necessary." However, the United States must review whether this situation is true, and the U.S. Congress must decide whether to grant the waiver.

The U.S. State Department spokesman said that the United States "will sympathetically consider" Britain's request for a waiver of interest. As everyone knows, since the end of the war, the United States has been taking advantage of Britain's economic difficulties to strengthen its control over Britain and has been squeezing out British influence everywhere.

### 英国乞求取消贷款利息  华盛顿表示可以考虑

　  英国乞求取消贷款利息
　  华盛顿表示可以考虑
    据新华社5日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院新闻发布官怀特12月4日对记者说，美国“将同情地考虑”英国提出的要求放弃给英国的一笔贷款的到期利息的建议，并且将把这个建议提交国会讨论。
      （编者注）英国政府因财政经济困难，要求美国准予免付今年到期的贷款利息，只偿还到期本金。
    英国在1945年末借了美国三十七亿五千万美元，另外还有第二次世界大战时租借协定和互惠援助债务六亿美元。按照协议，这两笔债务从1951年起，每年分期偿付本息，在五十年内偿清。过去五年，英国均照付本息，债务余额还有四十亿六千万美元。今年12月31日，英国要偿付本息一亿四千万美元，其中利息达八千二百万美元。
    英国的这一身债，是第二次世界大战造成的恶果。现在，侵埃战争使英国连利息也付不起了。
    根据协议，当“联合王国政府发现，鉴于当前和将来的国际汇兑的情况和它的黄金和外汇准备金数量，而有免除（利息）的必要时”，英国可以要求免除利息。但还要美国审查这种情况是否属实，而且须由美国国会决定是否免除。　　美国国务院发言人表示美国“将同情地考虑”英国免付利息的要求。大家知道，战后以来美国一直在利用英国经济困难，加强对英国的控制，并到处排挤英国的势力。
