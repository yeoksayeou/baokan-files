Upholding the Traditional Friendship of Mutual Assistance Between Two Neighboring Provinces
Shanxi Vigorously Supports the People of Disaster-Stricken Areas in Hebei to Overcome the Famine

(Reported by our newspaper) The broad masses of people in Shanxi Province are extremely concerned about the people of Hebei Province who have suffered from severe floods and have provided them with great assistance over the past few months.

During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the people of Hebei Province vigorously supported the battle to liberate Taiyuan with manpower and material resources. When Hebei Province suffered a disaster in 1953, the people of Shanxi Province sent people to express their condolences to the people of Hebei. When the people of Shanxi Province suffered a drought last year, Hebei Province organized a delegation to visit the disaster areas, boosting the confidence of the people in Shanxi disaster areas in overcoming the famine. The people of Shanxi Province have not forgotten this deep friendship. Since the autumn of this year, they have launched a large-scale movement to support their compatriots in disaster-stricken Hebei. From the secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee to ordinary staff and masses, some donated clothes, some donated money, and some donated grain. In more than a month, the people of the province donated 80,000 pieces of winter clothing, 500,000 jin of millet, and 50,000 yuan in Renminbi. The people of the province wrote 10,000 letters of condolence to the people of Hebei Province.

As the donation campaign was coming to an end, Shanxi Province sent a delegation led by Yang Zixiu, Director of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, and Si Zhengqing, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, to Hebei Province in early November. They went deep into the most severely affected areas of Baoding and Tianjin to express their condolences to the disaster-stricken people and distribute the collected materials to the victims. This profound friendship boosted the confidence of the disaster victims in overcoming the famine. Song Qinshi, an old lady from Huangtuo Village, Qingyuan County, said: "In the old society, people who suffered disasters starved for days and nights, and no one ever asked or cared whether they froze or starved to death. Now, the central government and the people of the whole country are supporting us, and you are here to comfort us. In these days, I feel much younger. I will actively engage in production and overcome the famine." Three days after the visit, Huangtuo Village added six new sideline productions, such as weaving homespun cloth, and the number of people participating in sideline production increased from 81% to 84% of the total labor force. Zhao Wen, an old man in his seventies who had performed storytelling in Taiyuan and other places, presented the condolence delegation with the following poem: "I lived in Taiyuan for five years, where countless friends offered support in times of need. Now, you have come from afar to express your condolences, I can close my eyes in peace with a smile on my face."

    发扬两个邻省患难相助的传统友谊
    山西大力支援河北灾区人民渡荒
    本报讯　山西省广大人民对遭受了严重水灾的河北省人民极为关怀，几个月给了河北省人民以很大的支援。
    在第三次国内革命战争时期，河北省人民曾从物力和人力上大力支援了解放太原的斗争。1953年河北省遭灾时，山西人民派人去慰问河北人民；去年山西省人民遭受旱灾时，河北省组织慰问团到灾区进行慰问，鼓舞了山西灾区人民的渡荒信心。山西省人民忘不了这种深情厚意，从今年秋季以来，掀起了规模巨大的支援河北受灾同胞的运动。山西省从省委书记到一般工作人员和群众，有的捐衣，有的捐钱，有的捐粮，在一个多月的时间里，全省人民共捐出了寒衣八万件，小米五十万斤，人民币五万元，全省人民给河北省人民写了一万封慰问信。
    当募捐运动将要结束的时候，山西省派出由山西省民政厅厅长杨自秀和中共山西省委副秘书长司正卿率领的慰问团，于11月上旬到达河北省，并深入受灾最严重的保定和天津专区，对受灾群众进行慰问，并把募集的物资分发给灾民们。这种深情厚意鼓舞了灾民们战胜灾荒的信心。清苑县黄陀村的宋秦氏老太太说：“在旧社会，受灾的人饿八天八宿，冻死饿死有谁来问过瞧过。现在呢，中央和全国人民来支援我们，你们还来慰问我们，在这样的日子里，我感到年轻多了。我要积极生产，渡过荒灾。”黄陀村在经过慰问后的第三天，就新增加了织土布等六种副业生产，参加副业生产的人数由占总劳力的81％增加到84％。曾在太原等地说过大鼓的七十多岁的赵文老汉，献给慰问团如下的诗句：“当年五载居太原，扶危朋友成万千，又蒙千里来慰问，瞑目九泉露笑颜。”
