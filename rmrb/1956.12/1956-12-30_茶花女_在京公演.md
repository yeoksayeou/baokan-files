Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: The world-renowned classic opera "La Traviata" premiered in Beijing last night.

This three-act, four-scene opera was adapted by the great 19th-century Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi and librettist Francesco Maria Piave from the novel "La Dame aux Camélias" by the famous French novelist Alexandre Dumas fils.

This is the first time an Italian classical opera has been performed in China. The excellent performance explained Verdi's music very well, and the actress playing Violetta vividly portrayed the image of the woman in Dumas's novel. The sets, costumes, and props faithfully depicted the customs and habits of the time, greatly assisting the actors' artistic creation.

In this opera, Violetta was played by Fang Xiaotian, and Violetta's lover, Alfredo, was played by Wu Daocen. Other actors who will take turns playing the leading male and female roles include Guan Lin, Zhang Quan, Li Guangxi, and Yang Guangjiang.

The opera was directed by Gu Feng, and the music conductor was violinist Li Guoquan.

Soviet vocal expert V.A. Demintieva served as the artistic director of the opera.

    “茶花女”在京公演
    据新华社27日讯　世界著名古典歌剧“茶花女”昨晚在北京首次上演。
    这出三幕四场歌剧是意大利十九世纪伟大的歌剧作曲家朱瑟比·威尔弟和剧作者庇阿维根据法国名小说家小仲马的小说“茶花女”编写的。
    在中国演意大利古典歌剧，这还是第一次。优秀的演出很好地解释了威尔弟的音乐，扮演茶花女的演员很好地表现了小仲马笔下女性的形象。无论布景、服装、道具，也都忠实地描绘了当时的风俗习尚，大有助于演员的艺术创造。
    在这个歌剧中，茶花女由方晓天扮演，茶花女的情人亚芒由吴道岑扮演。其他轮流扮演男女主角的演员还有管林、张权、李光羲、杨光江。
    这出歌剧由谷风导演，音乐指挥是小提琴家黎国荃。
    苏联声乐专家瓦·阿·捷敏启也娃任这出歌剧的艺术指导。
