Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 3rd. By the end of November, over 100,000 workers and family members in Anshan had participated in spare-time cultural studies ranging from senior high school to literacy classes. Among them, over 70,000 illiterate people participated in literacy studies, more than three times the number at the end of last year.

Since the first half of this year, workers and masses in various factories and construction sites in Anshan have made great efforts to persist in cultural studies. Some units lacked classrooms and benches for running study classes, so workers used waste materials to build houses and make benches in their spare time. Some capital construction workers have high mobility and cannot attend study classes, so culturally literate workers organized literacy teams, with members distributed in each production group responsible for helping a group of workers learn culture. Some illiterate veteran workers and literate young workers or their own children signed teaching contracts. Some units also run "Mommy Classes" specifically for female workers with children.

The upsurge in cultural learning has also been launched among workers' families. Residents' committees throughout the city have organized more than 2,000 literacy classes and literacy groups, with more than 30,000 people participating in the study. Family committees have also set up publicly-assisted, privately-run kindergartens and organized family members to take care of children for each other, solving the difficulties for workers' families to study culture.

### 鞍山十万多职工和家属学习文化

　　鞍山十万多职工和家属学习文化
    新华社鞍山3日电　到11月底，鞍山已有十万多职工和家属参加了从高中到扫盲班的业余文化学习，其中参加扫盲学习的文盲有七万多人，比去年年底增加了三倍以上。
    自今年上半年以来，鞍山各工厂和工地的职工群众都为坚持文化学习作了很大的努力。有些单位开办学习班没有教室和凳子，工人就在业余时间自己动手用旧材料盖房子、做凳子。部分基本建设工人工作流动性大，不能参加学习班学习，有文化的职工就组织了扫盲队，由分布在每个生产小组的队员负责帮助一组工人学习文化。有些不识字的老工人和识字的青年工人或自己的子女订立了教学合同。有的单位还专为有孩子的女职工开办了妈妈班。
    学习文化的高潮同样也在职工家属中开展了。全市各居民委员会已组织了两千多个识字班和识字小组，有三万多人参加了学习。家属委员会还举办了民办公助的幼儿园和组织家属互相看管孩子，解决了职工家属学文化的困难。
