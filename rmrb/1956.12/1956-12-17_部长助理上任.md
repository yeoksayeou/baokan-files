    Assistant Minister Takes Office
  　Qin Fu
    The list of assistant ministers has been announced in a certain ministry of the Central Government. People are excitedly discussing: the leadership has been strengthened, and work efficiency can be greatly improved.
    Among the people chatting, the head of the General Affairs Section appeared. He frowned and said, "Strengthening is certainly strengthening, but for those of us doing general affairs work, I'm afraid it will still add a lot of trouble."
    The words of the head of the General Affairs Section were not without reason. Before the "internally decided" time before the list of assistant ministers was announced, a future assistant minister called the head of the General Affairs Section and said, "Old Quan! Aren't I working in the same room as Deputy Director Li? This time, I should be given a separate office, right!"
    These words were spoken for several days, but a single office was still not available. First, there were no rooms, and second, the list of assistant ministers had not been officially announced. Now that the list has been officially announced, the newly appointed assistant minister will immediately formally raise the issue of a single office. How can the head of the General Affairs Section not panic? It's too late to build one immediately; adjusting the existing ones would mean that all the housing is already full. Let's have everyone use their brains! So, a "Life Committee" meeting, mainly consisting of the General Affairs Section and with the participation of personnel from various departments, began.
    In the meeting room, which had been quiet for a long time, someone fired the "opening shot." That person said, "As everyone knows, the rooms in our ministry are already crowded enough, and we've rented a lot of rooms outside. But what can we do? This new situation must be dealt with, so the only way is to squeeze even more, that is, to further adjust the housing of comrades below the rank of staff member." As soon as he finished speaking, someone immediately raised an objection: "The density of staff members' rooms is already large enough, already crowded enough." Someone said in a complaining tone: "Didn't they work in the past! Just because they became assistant ministers, can't they work together with two people anymore!" The discussion yielded no results, and the meeting adjourned.
    The General Affairs Section's "ineffectiveness" cannot but cause the assistant minister to personally handle this issue. He suddenly thought that there was a place where the office, dormitory, and kitchen were together, a total of three rooms. By connecting them and renovating them, it could be used as a large office. Although not very satisfactory, it could still be managed. So, he called the Director of the General Office and told him this valuable "three-in-one" suggestion. The Director of the General Office hesitated slightly and then agreed.
    However, the dormitory problem arose again. One day, Section Chief Quan suddenly received a notice from the newly appointed assistant minister saying that his dormitory and family should be moved out of the collective housing building and "slightly expanded." This "slightly expanded" tone immediately made Section Chief Quan worried. He is so busy that he still hasn't been able to submit an answer.
    Now for the other part of the story. The Director of the Personnel Department suddenly received a call, still from that assistant minister.
    "Hello! Director Cheng? How is the matter of my personal secretary going?"
    The Director of the Personnel Department put down the phone, puzzled: he had never seen any regulations from the State Council regarding equipping assistant ministers with secretaries! He had not received any instructions from the minister or decisions from the ministry's meetings! Moreover, there were no vacant positions or extra people. However, it is said that an assistant minister is actually equivalent to a vice-ministerial-level cadre. So, even without clear regulations and the minister's instructions, one must find a way.
    Xiao Zhang, who handles people's letters, received a transfer order. Although he still had a large pile of people's letters that had not been processed, he had to hand them over to others one by one. Although he knew that there were more letters than people, he had no choice but to obey the assignment.
    Xiao Zhang went to work in his new position. In the spacious office, there was only the assistant minister besides him. He had plenty of time to catch up on the few chapters of the political economy course he had missed.
    The assistant minister wanted to go out. Only then did Xiao Zhang have something to do. He picked up the phone near the assistant minister and said, "Hello! Driver's room? Bring out the assistant minister's dedicated car. Hurry!" Xiao Zhang's words were very simple, but they caused chaos in the driver's room. There were many cars, but no one could say which one was the assistant minister's dedicated car. The driver's room had no choice but to ask the General Affairs Section for instructions and temporarily draw a public car.
    Upon reaching the destination, the driver stopped the car. When he looked back at the pointer on the clock, he realized that from the point of view of saving gasoline, this business trip was much more cost-effective than the last trip to the Ming Tombs. Because, although he lowered the speed of the car to the minimum in order to "ensure" the "comfort" of the assistant minister, it only took less than five minutes to arrive.
    A few nosy people put together a poem:
    Assistant Minister takes office for the first time,
    Section chiefs and staff members are in a mess;
    Not much work has been seen done,
    Cars and houses are the first things on their minds!

### 部长助理上任

    部长助理上任
  　秦夫
    部长助理的名单，在中央某部宣布了。人们都兴奋地谈论：领导力量加强了，工作效率可以大大提高了。
    在扯谈的人中，出现了总务科长，他皱了一下眉头，说：“加强固然是加强，但是对我们做总务工作的人来说，恐怕还是增加了不少麻烦。”
    总务科长的话不是无因的。还在部长助理名单公布以前的“内定”的时间，一位未来的部长助理把总务科长叫去，说道：“老全！我不是同李副局长在一个房子里办公吗？这回该给我单独安置个办公室了吧！”
    这话说了好几天，单人办公室还是没有。一来没有房子，二来部长助理的名单尚未正式公布。如今，名单正式宣布了，新上任的部长助理马上就会正式提出单人办公室的问题，你说总务科长怎能不慌？马上修建吧，来不及；调整吧，所有的住房早已挤满了。还是让大家开动脑筋吧！于是以总务科为主而吸收各司局人员参加的“生活委员会”会议开始了。
    在静寂了好久的会场中，有人开了“头炮”。那人说：“大家都知道，我们部里的房子已经够挤了，而且在外边还租了不少房子。可是，有什么办法呢？这一新的情况不能不应付，那么唯一的办法是再挤，就是说，把科员以下的同志的住房再加以调整。”他的话刚说完，有人立即提出了反对意见：“科员们房间的密度已经够大了，已经挤得够受了。”有人以抱怨的口气说：“难道他们过去就不办公吗！当了部长助理就不能再两个人一起办公了吗！”讨论没有结果，会议散了。
    总务科“办事不力”，不能不使那位部长助理亲自处理这个问题。他忽然想到，有一个地方的办公室、宿舍和厨房在一起，共三间，把它打通，修葺一番，就可作为一间大办公室了，虽然还不太满意，但尚可凑合。于是一个电话，找到办公厅主任，把这一“三举一得”的宝贵建议告诉了他。办公厅主任略一踌躇，也便同意了。
    然而，宿舍问题又来了。一天，全科长忽然又接到新上任的部长助理的通知说，要把他的宿舍和家属从集体住宿的大楼里搬出来，并要“略加扩大”。这个“略加扩大”的口气，顿时使全科长发愁起来。他忙得满头大汗，到现在还没法交卷哩。
    话分两头。却说人事司长忽然又接到电话，仍是那位部长助理。
    “喂！程司长吗？我的私人秘书的事办的怎么样了？”
    人事司长放下电话，心中纳闷：没有看见过国务院关于给部长助理配备秘书的任何规定呀！也没有得到过部长的指示或部务会议的决定啊！况且也没有空额编制和多余的人。可是，据说部长助理实际上就等于副部长一级干部。那么，即使没有明文规定和部长的指示，也要想想办法了。
    处理人民来信的小张得到调令，虽然他手边还有一大堆人民来信没有处理，也不得不一五一十地交给别人。尽管他知道信多人少，也只好服从分配。
    小张到新的岗位上班了。宽敞的办公室里，除他而外只有部长助理。他有充分的时间，把拉下的几章政治经济学课程补上了。
    部长助理要外出。小张这才有事做了，他拿起了靠近部长助理身旁的电话说：“喂！司机室吗？把部长助理的专用汽车开出来。快！”小张的话虽然很简单，但却引起了司机室的一场混乱。大小汽车不少，却没有一个人能说出那个是部长助理的专车。司机室只好请示总务科，临时抽出一部公用小汽车来。
    到了目的地，司机杀了车。他回头看钟上的指针时，才发觉这次出差从节约汽油的观点来看，比上次去十三陵要合算得多了。因为，尽管他为了“保证”部长助理的“舒适”而把车的速度压到最低，但却不用五分钟就到了。
    几个多事的人，拚凑了一首诗：
    部长助理初上任，
    科长科员乱纷纷；
    工作没见做多少，
    汽车房子先挂心！
