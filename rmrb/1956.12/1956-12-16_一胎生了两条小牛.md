    A cow belonging to the Second Agricultural Cooperative of Puyong Township, Puyi District, Pu'er County, Yunnan, recently gave birth to two female calves in one litter. Thanks to the careful care of the cooperative's breeders, who used soy milk with salt to replace cow's milk for feeding, both calves are growing very strong and fat. According to the members of the cooperative, this old cow has previously given birth to six bull calves and five heifer calves.

    一胎生了两条小牛
    云南普洱县普义区普勇乡第二农业社的一条老母牛，最近一胎生下了两头小母牛。由于社里的饲养员精心照管，还用豆浆加上盐巴代替牛奶喂养，两头小牛都长得很肥壮。据社员们说，这头老母牛已先后产过六头公牛和五头母牛了。
