Actively Seeking New Raw Materials

    Sichuan has found over fifty kinds of wild fibers.
    Using Imperata cylindrica (cogongrass) husks and Hibiscus mutabilis (cottonrose hibiscus) bark to make rope, banana fiber to weave cloth, and wild cotton skin, Broussonetia papyrifera (paper mulberry) bark, and Miscanthus sinensis (Chinese silvergrass) etc. to make paper, these are some of the new raw materials that supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan Province have newly discovered this year to solve the shortage of fiber materials.
  The reporter saw over fifty kinds of finished products made from new raw materials at the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative. Most of them are wild plant fibers, produced in mountainous areas such as Fuling, Ya'an, and Daxian, which were not utilized in Sichuan Province in the past. For example, the raw materials for making waxed paper, such as dream flower skin and wild cotton skin, were discovered by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry, which sent people to Sichuan to work with supply and marketing cadres in Sichuan Province to go deep into the mountains to solve the shortage of raw materials in Zhejiang Province. Among them, more than 900,000 jin of wild cotton skin alone was supplied to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry in the first half of this year.
    The finished products made from these raw materials are generally of good quality. The pulling force of a rope made of cogongrass husk as thick as chopsticks can reach 450 to 500 jin, which is better than brown rope. The cloth woven from banana fiber has a smooth, white and clean color. Destructive testing is currently underway, and it can be promoted once successful.
    The Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has made preliminary estimates of the value of fourteen of these raw materials: the possible output in the province is more than 2.2 million dan (one dan is 100 jin), with a total value of more than 37 million yuan. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川找到五十多种野生纤维
    用芭茅壳和芙蓉树皮制绳，芭蕉纤维织布，野棉皮、构树皮和蓑草等造纸，这是四川省各地供销合作社今年为解决纤维原料不足而新发掘的一些原料。
  记者在四川省供销合作社看见五十多种用新原料制的成品，它们大多是野生植物纤维，产于涪陵、雅安、达县等山区，在四川省内过去没有利用过。如制造腊纸的原料梦花皮、野棉皮等是浙江省工业厅为解决该省原料不足，派人到四川来会同四川省的供销合作干部深入山区发现的。其中野棉皮一项今年上半年就给浙江省工业厅供应了九十多万斤。
    这些原料制出的成品，一般质量都好，芭茅壳制的一根筷子粗的绳子拉力可达四百五十斤到五百斤，比棕绳还好。用芭蕉纤维织的布色泽光滑白净，现正在进行破坏性试验，一经成功就可推广。
    四川省供销合作社对这些原料中价值大的十四种作了初步估计：全省可能产量为二百二十多万市担（一担一百斤），总值达三千七百多万元。　（新华社）
