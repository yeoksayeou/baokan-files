Reflections on an Untitled Subject
Zhong Huai
A few figures: According to the First Five-Year Plan, comparing 1957 with 1952, China's total industrial output value will increase by 98.3%, and the labor productivity of state-owned industrial departments will increase by 64%.

A few other figures: Comparing 1956 with 1952, the conference expenses of Hunan provincial-level organs have increased by 5.8 times, and the procurement expenses have also increased by more than five times (see December 8th issue of *New Hunan Daily*).

If administrative expenses continue to increase at this rate in various regions, and if this phenomenon is not immediately stopped, it is worth worrying about whether our industrialization cause can be completed on schedule.

Every time a meeting is held, there must be a dinner party and a theatrical performance. When a new office building is built, brand-new and luxurious furniture must be purchased. Newly promoted section chiefs and directors, even if they borrow from public funds, must take off their cotton-padded clothes and put on woolen coats. ...

It is said that this is "fitting": "fitting" with the grandness of the meeting, "fitting" with the imposing manner of the office building, "fitting" with the new titles.

But there is one thing that is not "fitting" – I am referring to our revolutionary tradition of hard work and simplicity.

    几个数字：按照第一个五年计划，拿1957年同1952年比较，我国工业总产值将增长98.3％，国营工业部门劳动生产率提高64％。
    另外几个数字：拿1956年同1952年比较，湖南省级机关的会议费增加了五点八倍，购置费也增加了五倍多（见12月8日新湖南报）。
    要是各地都以这样的速度来增加行政费用，要是这种现象不立即制止，我们的工业化事业能不能如期完成，就值得忧虑了。
    每逢开会必须聚餐，看戏。建成了新的办公大楼，就得置办崭新豪华的家具。新提拔的科长、主任，哪怕是向公家借支，也要脱下棉袄换上呢衣。……
    据说这样才“相称”：同会议的隆重“相称”，同办公大楼的气派“相称”，同新的职衔“相称”。
    可就是有一点不“相称”——我是说，对于我们的艰苦朴素的革命传统。
