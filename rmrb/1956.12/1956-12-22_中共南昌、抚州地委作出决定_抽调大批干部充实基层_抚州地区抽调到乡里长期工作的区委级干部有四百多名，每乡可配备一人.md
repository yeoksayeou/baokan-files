Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 19th: The CPC Jiangxi Provincial Nanchang Prefectural Committee and Fuzhou Prefectural Committee recently decided to transfer a group of cadres with rural work experience from the Special Zone and county-level organs to strengthen the grassroots leadership.

The Nanchang region plans to send one-third of the cadres currently in the Special Zone and county-level organs to work in township-level Party organizations and township people's committees. The Fuzhou region has decided to transfer a total of 420 district committee-level cadres to work long-term in the townships, with one cadre assigned to each township. At the same time, the work teams established after the abolition of districts and the merging of townships will be reorganized into Party District Work Committees, composed of seven or nine people.

After the abolition of districts and the merging of townships in the Nanchang and Fuzhou regions, most of the district committee-level cadres with long-term rural work experience were transferred to the leading organs at the Special Zone and county levels, weakening the grassroots leadership strength at the township level. Although many new forces have grown up among the grassroots cadres, most of them lack experience in leading the agricultural collective economy and Party work. Under the heavy workload of rural work after cooperation, they cannot fully adapt to the requirements of the work. On the other hand, the transfer of a large number of cadres to the Special Zone and counties has made the upper-level organs large and overstaffed, resulting in an abnormal phenomenon of being top-heavy and bottom-light. The CPC Nanchang Prefectural Committee and Fuzhou Prefectural Committee believe that if this situation is not quickly reversed, it will inevitably affect the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the increase in agricultural production next year. Therefore, they have decided to transfer a group of cadres to strengthen the grassroots leadership and require these transferred cadres to frequently go deep into the agricultural cooperatives to lead agricultural production and consolidate and improve the agricultural cooperatives.

    中共南昌、抚州地委作出决定
    抽调大批干部充实基层
    抚州地区抽调到乡里长期工作的区委级干部有四百多名，每乡可配备一人
    新华社南昌19日电　中共江西省南昌地委和抚州地委最近决定从专区和县级机关中，抽调一批有农村工作经验的干部充实基层领导力量。
    南昌地区准备把现在专区和县级机关中三分之一的干部派到乡级党组织和乡人民委员会担任工作。抚州地区决定抽调到乡里长期工作的区委级干部共四百二十名，每乡可以配备一名。同时，把在撤区并乡后建立的工作队改为党的区工作委员会，以七人或九人组成。
    南昌、抚州地区自撤区并乡后，大部分有长期农村工作经验的区委级干部都上调到专区和县级的领导机关，乡级基层领导力量被削弱了。虽然在基层干部中成长出不少新生力量，但他们大多数都缺乏领导农业集体经济和党的工作经验，在合作化以后，农村工作繁重的情况下，就不能完全适应工作的要求。另一方面，大批干部上调到专区和县，使上级机关机构庞大，人浮于事，形成头重脚轻的不正常现象。中共南昌地委和抚州地委认为，如果不迅速转变这种情况，必然影响农业社的巩固和明年的农业增产，因此决定抽调一批干部充实基层领导力量，并且要求这批下调的干部，要经常深入农业社中，领导农业生产和巩固提高农业社。
