Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 8th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated in the Council of States on December 7th that the fundamental way to solve the problem of eliminating the fear of war is to "withdraw and abolish all foreign troops and foreign bases from all countries."

Nehru said that the Cold War has created huge armed national blocs, each of which "not without some reason, not without some justification" calls itself a defensive group. Nehru said, "The claim that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization or the Baghdad Pact is defensive is completely untenable."

In his speech in the Council of States, Nehru expressed his opposition to the proposal by Communist Party of India member Mazumdar to demand that India withdraw from the Commonwealth. This proposal pointed out that India's continued membership in the Commonwealth is inconsistent with the principles of Panchsheel.

Nehru said, "I am in favor of anything that unites us without binding us in the slightest." He believes that participating in the Commonwealth is not a constraint.

Nehru added, "It is India's glory and India's policy to act as a bridge between countries, rather than to destroy bridges that already exist. There are already enough divisions in the world, so we don't want to add new ones."

　　尼赫鲁抨击马尼拉集团和巴格达条约
    新华社新德里8日电　印度尼赫鲁总理12月7日在联邦院说，解决消除战争恐惧的问题的基本途径是“把所有外国部队和外国基地从一切国家撤走和取消”。
    尼赫鲁说，冷战已经造成巨大的武装的国家集团，每个集团都“不无某种原因、不无某种理由地”把自己称作防御性集团。尼赫鲁说，
  “有人说东南亚条约组织或巴格达条约是防御性的，这种说法是完全不足取的。”
    尼赫鲁在联邦院的演说中表示反对印度共产党议员马祖姆达尔关于要求印度退出英联邦的提案。这个提案指出，印度继续保持英联邦成员国的资格是同潘查希拉的原则不一致的。
    尼赫鲁说，“我赞成把我们团结在一起而丝毫不把我们束缚在一起的任何事物。”他认为，参加英联邦并不是束缚。
    尼赫鲁又说，“要在各国之间充当桥梁，而不是要破坏已经存在的桥梁，这是印度的光荣，也是印度的政策。世界上的鸿沟已经很不少了，因此我们不想再加添新的鸿沟。”
