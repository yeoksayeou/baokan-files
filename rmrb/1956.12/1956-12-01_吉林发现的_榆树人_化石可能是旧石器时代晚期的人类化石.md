Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The "Yushu Man" fossils discovered in Yushu County, Jilin Province, have now been preliminarily inferred by archaeologists and paleontologists to possibly be human fossils from the Late Paleolithic period, estimated to be approximately tens of thousands of years old.

　　The "Yushu Man" fossils were initially discovered in Zhoujiayoufang Village, Yushu County, Jilin Province. This location is situated on the edge of a hilly area, with a small river containing clay and gravel strata in front of the village. In the summer of 1951, a flood exposed the strata containing mammalian fossils. Local farmers discovered many fragmented bones of woolly mammoths, rhinoceroses, and other animals that had been washed onto the riverbank. Professor Zeng Fanren from the Northeast Institute of Technology and personnel from the Jilin Provincial Museum went to excavate and collected human skull fragments that were entirely of modern human nature, as well as a large number of animal fossils, which were sent to the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences for identification.

　　This discovery attracted the attention of academic circles both domestically and internationally. In August of this year, the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sent personnel to investigate the fossil situation in Jilin Province again. This investigation mainly focused on studying the geological age of "Yushu Man" based on geological conditions. They collected thousands of kilograms of fossils of animals coexisting with "Yushu Man," such as woolly mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, primitive cattle, roe deer, hyenas, fish, frogs, and birds, among which mammoth fossils were the most abundant. However, no human fossils were found. According to experts' examination of the strata, it is very likely that the so-called "Yushu Man" belongs to humans of the Late Paleolithic period, but only two broken skull fragments were originally discovered, and it is difficult to draw more conclusions from their morphology.

　　Staff members of the Jilin Provincial Museum have recently discovered more than ten fossil sites and many Neolithic sites. In the area a dozen or so *li* upstream and downstream of the Songhuajiang Station in Dehui County, five Neolithic sites were discovered on the terraces along the river, and many finely crafted microliths, stone axes, pottery net sinkers, fragments of pottery containers, and cooking utensils were collected. This provides new and important materials for archaeological work in the Northeast region.

### 吉林发现的“榆树人”化石可能是旧石器时代晚期的人类化石

　　吉林发现的“榆树人”化石可能是旧石器时代晚期的人类化石
    新华社讯　在吉林省榆树县发现的“榆树人”化石，现在已经被考古学家和古生物学家初步推断可能为旧石器时代晚期人类的化石，估计距离现在大约有几万年。
      “榆树人”化石最初是在吉林榆树县的周家油坊屯发现的，这个地方是处在丘陵地带边缘，屯前有一条小河含有粘土和沙砾累层。1951年夏天，大水把含有哺乳动物化石的地层露出了地面。当地的农民发现了许多毛象（猛犸）、犀牛等零碎骨胳被冲到河滩上。东北工学院的教授曾繁礽和吉林省博物馆的人员都前往发掘，采集了完全是现代人的性质的人类头骨碎片和大量动物的化石，并且送往中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室鉴定。
    这个发现引起了国内外学术界的注意。今年8月间，中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室又派人前往调查吉林省内化石的情况。这次的调查主要是从地质情况，研究“榆树人”的地质年代问题。他们搜集到同“榆树人”共生的动物毛象、毛犀、原始牛、狍、鬣狗、鱼、蛙、鸟类等化石几千斤，其中毛象的化石最丰富。但是没有发现人类化石。据专家从地层的研究上考察，很可能所谓“榆树人”是属于旧石器时代晚期的人类，但是原来发现只有两块破碎的头骨，从形态上也很难作出更多的推论。
    吉林省博物馆的工作人员在最近又发现了十多个化石地点和许多新石器时代的遗址。在德惠县松花江站上下流十几里长的沿江台地上就发现了五处新石器时代的遗址，采集到许多制作精致的细石器、石斧、陶网坠、陶制盛器和炊器的残片。对于东北地区的考古工作，供给了新的、重要的材料。
