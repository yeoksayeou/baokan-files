For the Italian road to socialism, for a democratic government of the working class!
Report by Comrade Togliatti at the Eighth Congress of the Italian Communist Party on the first agenda item (continued from yesterday)

The Italian Road to Socialism

When we move towards socialism, we must follow the Italian road. This point is the center of the preparatory work for the Congress and is also the center of the document submitted to the delegates by the Central Committee for approval.

Since the Italian Communist Party began to break away from the old sectarianism that was doctrinaire and powerless, it has striven to formulate a political line that correctly corresponds to the domestic situation and the conditions for class struggle.

I will not repeat what has been widely mentioned many times, that is, the concerns of our party since it began to break away from the old sectarianism that was doctrinaire and powerless, which is increasingly concerned with formulating a political line that correctly corresponds to the situation in our country and the conditions for class struggle under this situation. During the war and after liberation, compared with many other parties, a truly political line that characterizes our party emerged from this concern, and our main positions and actions are based on this line. These main positions and actions are: our policy of national unity, the essence of our relationship with the Socialist Party in the workers' movement, our attention to the active elements in the Catholic people's movement, our decisive role in drafting the constitutional charter, the famous vote on the seventh article of the constitution (this refers to the seventh article of the constitution regarding the relationship between the state and the church—note)—that is, agreeing to the treaty signed with the Catholic Church and settling the old anti-Catholicism, assisting in the drafting of the "Labor Plan" of the General Confederation of Labor, affirming the content and nature of the mass struggles that have taken place in cities and countryside, especially in the southern regions of Sicily and Sardinia, most of which we have participated in, emphasizing the necessity of liberating women, studying the problems of the younger generation and their tasks. In the struggle against the threat of war around the issue of foreign policy, we have always striven to guide this struggle, giving it a national content, a content of defending our independence and affirming our country's credibility, and making it consistent with our overall policy.

Some people say that these various political actions are our tactics, that is, merely our stratagems. This shows that they do not understand the essence of what is being discussed at all, and within the party, we must use serious arguments to oppose such people: these people think that seeking the Italian road is merely a convenient way to win the majority and thus develop the entire movement. It is not like that at all. It involves the way in which the socialist revolution raises issues in reality. The necessity of destroying the capitalist structure and establishing the socialist structure does not arise from decisions or techniques, nor does it arise from the strength of the class trade union movement. It is the product of the development and contradictions of the real forces and subjective forces of contemporary society. It is this development and these contradictions that make the socialist process necessary in history, so much so that one can say that socialism matures objectively within capitalism. Therefore, it is obvious that the conditions and forms of maturity can only be different according to different places and historical times. Take the capitalist system, for example, not only its content but also its structure are different. The level of development of productive forces in different countries is different, and at the same time, the adjustment of production relations is also different in general, although in general it is roughly the same in countries where capitalism has become the dominant factor. The relationship between urban and rural areas is not the same, it often changes according to the degree of the bourgeois revolution, the proportion and nature of independent small and medium producers are not the same, and cultural traditions are not the same. These differences determine the structure of the state, the nature of the leading groups, and the conditions and methods of class struggle. Even the changes common to the entire capitalist world (for example, the forward development of large monopolies today is such a case) are not realized in the same way everywhere, do not produce the same practical consequences, and will not raise the same problems everywhere.

The diversity of the paths to socialist development arises from history, economics, and the development of the workers' movement, and people often find that the spontaneity of this movement itself is diverse. The problem boils down to the leadership of the working class should estimate this, at least should make the vanguard of the entire proletariat aware of this, therefore, it should not deviate from the policy and working methods that are unique to each country and can only guarantee the fundamental unity and success of the entire movement.

The founders of the Italian Communist Party correctly raised and solved the problem of merging the struggle of the Italian working class with the struggle of the peasants in the south and the islands into a unified movement.

Therefore, when Antonio Gramsci drafted the program to be presented at the Third National Congress, he hoped that people would emphasize this point: the double blow against Italian capitalism—the blow of the working class that is forming and developing and the blow of the peasant masses in the south and the islands—is manifesting and tending to merge into a unified movement, long before the Socialist Party leadership considered this, and on the other hand, when this leadership turned a blind eye to the serious problems raised by the movement that arose in the south and in Sicily, it was also like this. The contradictions within the new Italian state itself determined the special conditions for the development of class struggle in this historical stage of ours, and these contradictions produced the conditions that would inevitably become the driving force of the Italian socialist revolution from the very beginning. The workers' movement only correctly understood the content of these problems much later, and this understanding should be attributed to Gramsci.

While we have been breaking away from the dogmatism that hindered us, we have always striven to remain faithful to this fundamental and primary lesson of this great man who founded our party, as well as to the methods that are part of this lesson.

The backwardness and disintegration of the central society, the imbalance between the south and the islands and other regions of Italy, and the serious impact of this situation on the rural labor masses, the middle classes, and even a part of the propertied classes, are all special products of the capitalist economic and political structure of Italy. Will these situations be eliminated with the development of capitalism, with the progress of industrial production and technology? So far, the results obtained are that they have not been eliminated; on the contrary, these situations have a tendency to become more serious in part. Then, should we wait for these situations to be eliminated with the socialist revolution? No, this would be fatalism and passive waiting, which cannot be concealed by any number of beautiful words. It is not enough to simply blame these situations; today, we must also call on the labor masses to fight against these situations and concretely point out to them how to eliminate these situations through universal land reform, rapid industrialization of the south, and the expansion of regional autonomy. Therefore, the problem is to launch a movement that is not only local but also national, in order to carry out such a profound reform. In this way, our party of the working class becomes the party of the southern laborers, the only true party of the south in our country.

But Gramsci himself, when analyzing the content of the Italian peasant problem, had already expanded his political vision. He said at the time that the Vatican problem, that is, the Catholic movement, is a component of the peasant problem. In this regard, progress has undoubtedly been made in many aspects. The Catholic movement is more mature today. However, the revolutionary actions and initiatives taken to create new living conditions for the peasants have been insufficient, fragmented, and chaotic among the migrant peasant masses, tenant farmers, and small landowners. This situation is caused, especially, by the fact that today the decline of mountain agriculture has raised several new problems, which in some respects are similar to the problems of the south. An entire part of the national economy, and therefore an entire part of the population, has fallen into a state of poverty, while we hear people singing the praises of capitalism, boasting about the reduction of the mountain population, that is, boasting about poverty, saying that this is an aspect of current social progress.

In the cities, there live a considerable number of middle-class people, which also exists in other capitalist countries that are highly developed in the West; and there are also many artisans who preserve ancient traditions, which is unique to us. Before these strata feel that they are closely related to the struggle against capitalism, are they determined by their nature to oppose the advance towards socialism? Must these strata first be forced into bankruptcy and forced to become proletarians?

Both of these arguments are incorrect. They are such a part of the laboring people: on the one hand, they create a special social structure due to their existence, but on the other hand, due to their living conditions often being very harsh, they cannot seek liberation without a thorough reform of this structure, and therefore they also hate this social structure. Today's capitalism is no longer like the capitalism of the past, but in the current transformation, it still retains its inherent characteristics. In our very special social environment, capitalism has combined the dominant advantages of industrial, financial, and agricultural monopolies with undeniable technological progress, with the development of production, with the microscopic and fundamentally unbalanced growth of national income. Therefore, we see a one-sided, deformed growth: it cannot eliminate the contradictions of the past, at most it only presents the contradictions in new forms, often more profound forms, it cannot eliminate the oppositions of the past, at most it only promotes new oppositions, often more acute oppositions.

The entire social and economic structure of Italy has deeply decayed. The task of the socialist revolution is to completely change the economic structure. What is urgently necessary today is to improve the living conditions of the residents, carry out land reform, and weaken the power of the large monopolies.

The entire social and economic structure has deeply decayed. Certain facts have already powerfully exposed this situation. The most serious of these facts is that there are always about two million people completely unemployed, and the number of underemployed workers is almost the same, and this situation occurs at a time when people are greatly exaggerating the rise in production indices of the main sectors of the economy. Certain facts that can undoubtedly be considered as phenomena of progress, such as the large-scale use of machinery in agriculture, tend to push out thousands and thousands of people from agricultural labor, thus making the aforementioned situation tragically worse. The vast majority of women do not participate in production, so a huge amount of labor force is not utilized. People occasionally decide to pay a little attention to the actual living conditions of the entire population, they conduct official investigations, and only then do other facts come to light; however, for the people, for those who live with the people, these facts always exist. For example, the widespread poverty in all parts of the country—not only in the south, Sicily, and Sardinia, but also in all the valleys, even in the plains of the north and near large cities—is such a situation. The shocking imbalance and huge disparity between the civilized life of capitalist countries in the West and our civilized life is also such a situation. We are often ranked at the bottom, and our serious, true backwardness is only slightly better than that of Spain, Turkey, Greece, and the very backward countries of the Middle East. Economically, compared to the past, one must also draw shocking conclusions. The calories that each resident can obtain have increased very little compared to 1911–1913 and before the Second World War. Even considering that the situations of the periods compared are somewhat different, one must conclude that despite the fact that the trade union struggles and political struggles of the past decade have managed to curb the tendency to lower the living standards of the important strata of industrial workers, for the entire people, the trend of impoverishment cannot be denied.

The whole situation is that the economic system cannot guarantee the continuous and reasonable development of productive forces, cannot make all citizens have work to do, cannot make us overcome the deep-rooted contradictions and backwardness. Therefore, not only do the workers feel the necessity of changing the structure of this system itself, but the majority of the residents, through various channels, also feel this necessity. Completely changing the economic structure is the task of the socialist revolution. However, today it is absolutely urgent to carry out partial reform work, and if we hope to improve the living conditions of all residents, we cannot delay this reform: for example, starting from the general limitation of land ownership, to carry out comprehensive land reform; again, taking the most urgent measures to weaken the power of the large monopolies.

The pressure of industrial and financial monopoly capital on the Italian economy has increased to a very frightening extent and more rapidly than in other capitalist countries, causing more serious imbalances.

The figures are well known. Now there are tens of thousands of joint-stock companies, and 70% of the share capital is concentrated in 180 of them. Among these 180, 40 control two-thirds of the entire Italian share capital, and 0.015% of the shareholders own half of the total capital. The domination of the financial market and the manipulation of prices by the large monopolies are undeniable, and their power is overwhelming. The largest companies have increased their declared profits from 1948 to 1954 by an average of around 30%, and the absolute figures are astronomical.

Today, in order to maintain the productive activities of the vast majority of residents (including the strata of small and medium producers, whose income is reduced due to the manipulation of the market by large monopoly capital), it is not only a matter of current interests but even a necessity to effectively fight against private monopoly capital. Monopoly capital is the leading force of capitalism in this stage. This is the most aggressive and reactionary force. Monopoly capital is the defender of international collusion that threatens national independence. Concentrating fire on large monopoly capital, putting it in the position of the accused, isolating it, and trying to take measures to limit its power and then eliminate it, is the task of those who decide to unite with the increasingly broad and confident people's masses to effectively fight against capitalism and strive for socialism, and this is also the task of those who do not passively wait for good days to come to everything.

This is the general basis for our struggle for structural reform, and it is also one of the main goals we want to achieve in seeking the path of development towards socialism under the current conditions. To equate the demand for such a reform with what we used to call temporary demands would be wrong; the latter refers to some slogans issued at the moment of acute revolutionary crisis, whose purpose is only to guide the masses towards the struggle to seize power, that is, slogans that quickly lose their effectiveness in this struggle. Structural reform is an active goal that we strive to achieve, and this goal can be achieved under the current conditions of political struggle. We eagerly hope to carry out universal land reform according to the principles stipulated by the constitution, because farmers and the entire nation need this reform immediately, and because this reform can already be achieved even today. We hope to nationalize the largest monopolies in industry and finance, which is also possible. We hope to achieve the limitation and thus the destruction of the economic power of monopoly capital through democratic control over prices, profits, tariffs, and real estate speculation, through a fundamental reform of the tax system; we hope to achieve these things, believing that these things can be achieved and are working to promote their realization, because the satisfaction of the immediate demands of a large part of the residents depends on the realization of these things, and to achieve these, farmers can obtain land and work, artisans and small producers will not be suffocated by the enormous forces that are hostile to them, and the entire nation can be freed from the chains that hinder their progress. Structural reform itself is not socialism, but it is a change in the economic structure that opens the way to progress towards socialism. These are measures of struggle against the main enemies of the working class and socialism today. These measures are also for the benefit of the people and peace.

Some people raise objections, saying that we take such actions with the hope of reforming capitalism rather than destroying it, and that—for example—in some countries, some structural reforms and several nationalization measures have been implemented, but this does not mean advancing towards socialism. The first objection is untenable because if one can argue in this way, then for any other economic or political demand that is not just an increase in wages, one can also argue in this way. On the other hand, the second objection raises the entire question of the struggle, that is, the struggle of the working class and the people's masses under the leadership of their party in the current situation, to affirm themselves as the leading factor in politics and the national economy. As an isolated measure, nationalization may have little significance. Adopting a certain form of nationalization may even give some benefits to certain capitalist groups or some non-progressive political groups. However, when nationalization or other measures of struggle against large monopoly capital are part of continuous and uninterrupted action and struggle, and are carried out according to the decisions of great political and mass organizations, and obtain the support of a large part of public opinion, and force the implementation of an economic policy favorable to workers and the middle class according to the existing conditions, and promote the government itself to take anti-monopoly actions through parliament—under these conditions, things change. Then, things change. At that time, even state intervention in economic life can have a completely different meaning, while when the government merely acts as a commercial committee for some monopolies, when the form of state capitalism is merely the form in which the state machine is subordinate to the will and interests of the big capitalists, state intervention in economic life is another matter. Therefore, this problem cannot be solved with some schemes, the solution of this problem depends on action, the way is to organize and lead a broad mass movement, to fight victoriously, and thus to force a fundamental change in the general economic and political policy. In the end, it is recognized that there are conditions today for carrying out the aforementioned actions and leading these actions to victory. Therefore, the question is ultimately about the political conditions under which class struggle is carried out, about the degree of maturity of the working class, the peasant masses, and the middle class, about the position of these forces in social and political struggle, about their level of awareness, about the universal loss of prestige of capitalism and the ruling class as its embodiment, about the increasing prestige and attraction of socialist thought among the broad masses of humanity.

In Italy, the unification of the various social forces struggling against capitalism into a broad, diverse, and unique class alliance, against the revival of fascism, has an objective basis. The Communist Party leads the working class to become the national leading class.

For our country, objective analysis shows us the unity of the broad front of social forces struggling against capitalism in the current environment; this unity is the objective basis of a broad, diverse, and unique system of class alliances. In the old Russia, before the revolution, the working class, which was mainly the leading force, allied with the broad peasant masses, and then with various different parts of these masses, according to the development of the revolution. In today's People's China, there are also groups of the national bourgeoisie participating in the construction of socialism. In our country, the broad peasant masses are united on the side of the eternal enemy of capitalism—the working class—up to and including the middle and small independent cultivators, and the broad productive middle classes in the cities, and we do not exclude the participation of a considerable number of middle and small industrialists in the struggle against monopoly capitalism in some regions. These conditions also determine some special paths of development for the construction of a certain socialist society.

For our artisans, for the broad masses of direct cultivators, for some important groups of small producers, the transition to the socialist form of production, that is, the form based on the principle of cooperation, is still a distant matter. As Engels said, this can only be the result of a spontaneous movement, the result of peasants thinking on their small plots of land. Before this, socialism must guarantee the property of those social strata that capitalism wants to destroy and annihilate. To carry out the struggle against monopoly capital, these social strata urgently need and hope to unite and tend towards the working class, and the struggle of the working class against capitalism and for socialism can guarantee their future.

The political struggle in our country, in its essential question, that is, from the question of struggling for freedom, democracy, and socialism, is determined by the great national experience gained in the resistance against fascism and the war of liberation, both in fact and in the awareness of the most prepared masses. From these trials, great political results have been gained, and in the Italian capitalist ruling class, there is always a tendency, whose representatives are the most powerful and reactionary bourgeois groups, to limit and destroy political freedom, first of all, the democratic rights of workers; these freedoms and rights are considered harmful traps and obstacles. Fascism was born from this tendency that exceeded everything, a tendency that was almost undeniable in the capitalist camp, a tendency that almost everywhere showed the dangerous tendency to imitate fascist methods. The resistance and struggle against fascism under the leadership of the working class and its party—the Communist Party—began. The working class, all laboring masses with socialist ideas, and their advanced party were at the forefront in the war of liberation and laid the historical and political foundations of the current democratic system in the process of the anti-fascist victory.

These great historical achievements are indelible and cannot be erased. Similarly, one cannot destroy the true achievements gained in these aspects, unless one wants to create such a division in Italian society that will eventually produce a new threat of fascism or another form of fascism. The year-long frenzied anti-communist hatred and angry outcry are not enough to make people forget that for nearly twenty-five years, our party has been and is the most vital and consistent democratic force; nor is it enough to make people forget that it is the Communist Party that has gained such historical honor in the deepest crisis that Italy has ever faced in modern history: leading the working class and making it the true national leading class. For a long time, we have been good at raising the flag of freedom and independence that others have let it fall to the ground and trampled on. This is a permanent element that has become increasingly clear with our political action and its progress.

To carry out the revolutionary struggle in the democratic manner prescribed by the constitution, to dissolve the actual power of the privileged classes, to carry out great reforms of the social structure, and to advance towards socialism, this is the path chosen by the party.

The greatest achievement of the working class and the people under this leadership and these conditions is the current constitution of the republic. In the way we fought and worked to achieve this constitution, there are already answers to many of the questions raised in the current debate on the workers' movement (although this is expressed in an implicit way), because the fundamental questions have been solved, that is, the question of advancing towards socialism within the framework of democratic legality has been solved. This makes all the cunning and deceitful accusations bankrupt. For a constitution that solemnly expresses the principles affirmed by the entire people in the resistance movement and the war of liberation, one cannot support and defend it with cunning or deceit.

We had hoped that the constitution would have the character of a program, that it would formulate a plan for a great reform of the social structure, which would be carried out in the democratic manner prescribed by the constitution itself, because this is the path we have chosen for our party, the working class, and Italy. One can ask us to pay attention to the fact that one must mainly proceed from the consideration of the situation in our country (and this is correct). The scope on which we base our planning is here. Today, the thesis that one can advance towards socialism in democratic and even parliamentary forms is universally proposed; but this thesis is proposed because of the changes in the structure of the world after the establishment of the socialist system, and considering the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism caused by the collapse of the colonial system, and finally considering the development of the workers' movement throughout the world and the growth of the prestige of socialist thought. This thesis is the one we proposed in 1944–46. (This thesis) could be universally proposed as a result of the great victories that were unimaginable ten years ago. These victories were achieved after acute struggles—such as the struggle to establish the People's Republic of China and the struggles that made the socialist world stronger after experiencing the cold war than before. And these situations, we could not foresee at that time. Our position was correct for us at that time, due to the great victory over fascism and all the consequences of this victory, and all this is still valid today, regardless of how capitalism has been restored since then.

I do not believe that one can accept the positions advocated by Comrade Lombardi of the Socialist Party in his recent writings and speeches.

According to his argument, the progress of democracy dominates the entire development of capitalist society in the current stage. From this argument, one would conclude the necessity and uniformity of the peaceful advance towards socialism, and that this is necessary now. Unfortunately, things are not like that, and if one starts from such a concept, one can directly fall into the old opportunism, into passive waiting, into passivity and acceptance of capitalist slavery. One should not adopt these erroneous generalizations. The progress of political democracy does indeed have an influence on the entire development of capitalist society and on how certain laws of the tendency of capitalism are realized. This is precisely a manifestation of the influence of the superstructure on the social structure that Marxists are very familiar with. However, the progress of political democracy does not change the essence of capitalism. As long as capitalism exists, democracy will always be limited and false, because there is no economic equality among people, and workers are not liberated from exploitation. The progress of democracy itself (this is the key issue) in some regions of the world is produced from special economic conditions, which are related to the imperialist development studied by Lenin, and in some of our neighboring countries, the progress of democracy is the result of the great pressure and struggle exerted by the working class to defend its own interests, to affirm itself as the leading force in society, and to make socialism victorious. However, in the ruling class, there is always a tendency to adopt various means to stop this process.

Therefore, we must beware of the talk about the "inevitability" of the "irreversibility" of the process, and beware of the consequent re-examination of our theoretical basis. Those who affirm the "irreversibility" of the process of easing international relations have been ruthlessly refuted by the outbreak of the current war crisis. I hope everyone will look at the history of the past few decades. The two great democratic developments both ended with world wars (1914 and 1939). If the October Revolution had not occurred, if the Soviet Union had not become such a strong country, perhaps there would have been many political democracies in Western Europe? However, before the Second World War, fascism not only ruled most of the land of capitalist Europe, but in places where fascism did not achieve victory, the bourgeois leadership groups almost everywhere showed the dangerous tendency to imitate fascist methods. If it were not for the policy of the Soviet Union and the Soviet army, fascism would have conquered all of Europe in various forms.

If China had not liberated itself under the leadership of the communists, there would not have been such a rapid collapse of the colonial system. It is the revolutionary struggle, the victory achieved through struggle, that has opened the democratic path towards socialism.

Of course, this does not mean that the crazy actions or intentions of a reactionary group are enough to destroy democratic progress. This only means that the decisive factor for progress is the existence of a great organized people's-worker movement, and this movement must be authoritative, united, and well-led; it must be the struggle of the proletariat and the people to limit the strong power and power of the privileged classes. This movement constantly exerts pressure, and this struggle achieves victory, and thus creates such unique new conditions as we have in our country today. The working class has not yet seized political leadership of the state, but the working class has dominated the people's movement on which our country relies for its revival, and then this country has a constitution that declares that the government is "based on labor," and the constitution affirms that it is necessary to carry out political and economic reforms for the renewal of our society and for the advancement towards socialism.

These are the unique achievements of the class struggle in a country like ours. Therefore, respecting and implementing the constitution has become the arena for the competition between the forces of socialist renewal and reactionary conservatism. One cannot separate the narrow political clauses of the constitution from its social and economic content. And our current democracy, from the content, is still limited and false, and is constantly threatened by the rulers themselves. However, the constitution condemns the authoritarian limitation of democratic rights, and stipulates that the material obstacles that cause inequality among citizens must be eliminated, and roughly points out the reforms that must be completed to eliminate these obstacles. In this way, the constitution itself opens the way for gradual reform, and thus gradually dissolves the actual power of the privileged classes, and makes democracy itself increasingly broad and effective. We know how stubborn the resistance of the ruling class and its parties is to this progress; and we do not exclude the possibility of a reactionary coup. However, when we consider this possibility, we draw the conclusion that we must more resolutely grasp the banner of democratic progress and the defense of freedom, not only to defend our interests but also to defend the interests of all popular strata and the entire Italian society. A reactionary coup is possible, but we cannot conclude from this that we must change the nature of our party and its revolutionary strategy. On the contrary, we insist on this direction.

Our revolutionary thought has fundamental differences with the reformism inherent in the Socialist Party. Establishing the prospect of democratic development does not mean abandoning the struggle. The current historical task is to realize the necessary leadership of the working class through new alliances and cooperation, to lead the construction of socialism politically.

In this specific issue of the institution, the struggle with the conservative forces has been particularly sharp. The left-wing liberals distort the facts, and in our view, they are essentially the same as the enemies of democracy; we hope they will abandon this distortion. If we had not fought victoriously against deceptive laws, if the socialists had not fought (referring to the fight against the new electoral law in 1953, which attempted to give the Christian Democratic Party an absolute majority—note), then the parliamentary system would have been in a state of neither life nor death today. Deceptive laws are the first step towards the abolition of the parliamentary system. As for us, if we do not consider the parliamentary system to be of great value, if we regard the parliament only as a platform for agitation against the current government and the capitalist system, we would not fight so tenaciously. However, the victory of June 7 only guarantees us a prerequisite to promote the parliament to effectively participate in the great work of renewing society. As the parliament works now, it has not fulfilled this responsibility, and this question must be seriously raised to the entire democratic public opinion and the nation.

Our approach to the issues of freedom, democracy, parliament, and socialism has always changed with the development of the balance of class forces, with the struggle of the working class and the people's forces that the working class can lead, and with the progress of the struggle against the capitalist ruling class. The most fundamental point of difference between our revolutionary thought and the reformism inherent in the Socialist Party lies here.

The objective conditions for socialism mature within capitalist society, this is a scientific and correct judgment. Reformism, however, deduces from this judgment the idea that one only needs to wait for socialism to be hatched from within capitalism by a miracle. From this, a tendency arises to think that the development of capitalism itself is already the process of advancing towards socialism. The leaders of the Socialist Party deduce from this view the theory that their task is to manage capitalism and capitalist society well, since this will also lead to socialism. Since they are willing to do so, in order to manage capitalism as they should, they launched the Suez War, and ignited the flames of war in the world. For them, democracy is no longer a position that has been seized and must be defended and expanded by mass democratic struggle, but an empty phrase, the opposite of what it should be, as shown by the collusion between Saragat and Segni here. Destroying the constitution, trampling on the constitution, using state violence against laborers, this is not defending democracy, but using violence to prevent the establishment and development of democracy.

We are democratic because we act within the framework of the constitution, democratic habits, and the legal system established by the constitution; we demand that everyone respect this legal system, that everyone execute all the provisions of the constitution, first of all, the rulers execute these provisions. We have already taken the democratic position in order to advance towards socialism from there. Therefore, we even defend this position. And not only that, the urgency of socialist renewal, the fact that this renewal is in the interests of the vast majority of the people, the increasing awareness of this fact, this awareness increasingly manifests itself as a movement of united masses that is increasingly large and enjoys increasing prestige—all this makes us see that the democratic and constitutional principles of life, for the construction of socialism that proceeds gradually and causes the least possible division and the least possible sacrifices to the working masses and the state, are not an obstacle but a help. If Lenin, a few months before the October Revolution in 1917, did not rule out the possibility of the peaceful development of the socialist revolution and the permanent coexistence of several parties, then we today in this world that has been deeply renewed by socialism have even more right to consider the realization of this possibility as our fundamental task.

Therefore, in a document submitted to the Congress, we wrote: "For the working class and the Italian people, the current historical task is to realize the necessary leadership of the working class through new alliances and new cooperation, respecting democratic methods, using the strength of the entire laboring people who are moving towards liberation and complete emancipation, breaking the resistance and conspiracies of the enemies of freedom and social progress, and thus proceeding towards the construction of socialism through a new path that is different from the way of establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat in other countries."

This statement does not modify our principles in the slightest. The dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, the political leadership of the working class in the construction of a socialist society, is a historical necessity. However, Lenin, after affirming that all countries will inevitably move towards socialism, said: "All countries do not move towards socialism in the same way. Each country has its own characteristics in the forms of democracy, as in the diversity of the forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as in the speed with which it reorganizes social life in a socialist way."

Establishing the prospect of democratic development does not mean abandoning tenacious struggle. It is necessary to carry out the struggle in the form determined by the situation; and the one who should lead this struggle is the working class led by the vanguard of the working class revolution; and in the process of the struggle, the progressive front that advances towards socialism should increasingly expand to include new social groups, and thus cultivate an increasingly high socialist consciousness in the working class and the entire people. If there is not all this, there is the danger of merely talking empty words. If one does not understand that the land reform and structural reform we demand, the democratic supervision of monopoly capital, the expansion of democracy, the effective use of parliament, and the complete renewal of our national life are all for the new living conditions of workers, peasants, the middle class, and the entire nation, for the elimination of poverty and social injustice, for the guarantee that everyone has work and can live a secure and worthy life, then there is the danger of falling into the trap of vague agitation with more or less reasonable slogans. The urgent problems that millions of men and women are anxiously facing should ultimately be the starting point.

The Italian working class has already played a political leadership role, and it can lead all laboring forces and progressive forces to reform the political, economic, and cultural order and complete the historical task.

What I mean is that if the thought, organization, rights, demands, and struggles of the working class, the support it gives to the demands and economic and political struggles of other social groups, and the support it gives to the struggles for freedom, work, and peace, cannot become the most active element in this movement, then the entire movement will lack political and social direction, lack socialist leadership.

The number of the Italian working class is not as large as in other countries in Western Europe. The Italian working class has not developed in the same way throughout the national territory. The working class in the capital is very weak, and in some regions of the south, there is almost no working class. Nevertheless, our working class has made a decisive contribution to our entire history. It has made great progress in its civic consciousness and political awareness in less than half a century. Our party is the most courageous and highest expression of this progress.

In 1900, when Italian society was undergoing a democratic transformation, Antonio Labriola, in a letter to Pasquale Villari—which I think has not been published—expressed a very reserved and cautious attitude towards the prospects of the socialist struggle. He said: "I have never imagined that Italian socialism could play a lever role in the overthrow of the capitalist world. In the civilized world, no one believes this, nor do the socialists of other countries believe this. I have always considered Italian socialism to be such a tool: 1. To develop the political awareness of the masses; 2. To educate that part of the workers that can be educated to establish class organizations; 3. To oppose the various groups called parties with a powerful mass organization; 4. To force the representatives of the government to carry out some economic reforms beneficial to the entire people. Strictly speaking, other socialist propaganda can only have practical effects on the descendants of Italy in the distant future." (Letter to Pasquale Villari, November 13, 1900)

These descendants have appeared, and they have been tempered in experience, struggle, and great sacrifices. Twenty-two years after writing this letter, someone clearly proposed the main urgent task at that time—the Turin proletariat led by Antonio Gramsci proposed a single political plan. This plan, after the First World War, could have made the working class the new leading class and thus saved Italy from the fascist disaster. Those who ignore the historical conditions and historical facts and mechanically apply conclusions that can only be suitable for the current situation at that time are unreasonable. In doing so, they forget that it was impossible to seize power by revolutionary means at that time, because there was no force that could lead another kind of struggle. Faced with this test, reformism and the highest programmatic maximalism that lacked consistency showed their inability and bankruptcy. Experience has shown that if one wants to take the democratic road, one must have a revolutionary leadership. This is the leadership that Antonio Gramsci hoped the working class would obtain according to Lenin's instructions. We have provided this leadership. For this reason, he was already able to see at that time that the task of the working class was to save Italy from disaster, and our efforts are to make this prophecy come true.

In this way, the working class has played a political leadership role, and today it has the right to demand leadership over the entire Italian society. It has completed the educational task mentioned by Labriola, it is no longer isolated, it is not only opposed to the capitalist world in principle, but it has a program for building a national society that is in the interests of the entire nation. It has advanced along the path indicated by this program. It can lead all laboring forces and progressive forces to reform the economy, political organization, and culture, and fully complete the historical task entrusted to it.

The most reactionary forces are stirring up a new wave of anti-communism, attempting to push the political situation to the right. The Christian Democratic Party is seeking a new type of totalitarianism. But anti-communist propaganda can never cover up the progress of freedom.

We should acknowledge with our usual sincerity and point out that on the path we have set, we estimate that we will encounter a period of difficulty. Due to the influence of the deep crisis in the international situation at present, the general economic situation, especially the living conditions of the people, will significantly worsen. The situation in winter will be very difficult, and our urgent task is to organize and mobilize the laboring masses to defend their existence. In the political life of our country, under the impetus and leadership of the most reactionary forces, a new, violent wave of anti-communism has been stirred up. The people who guide this movement are not lovers of freedom or concerned about the fate of the Hungarian people. They are indifferent to the massacre in Port Said. They have never shown any concern for the suffering peoples of Guatemala, Cyprus, Algeria, and Spain. They are interested in opposing us because we are at the forefront of the great cause of democratic reform and social reform in our country and call on the entire Italian people to carry out this reform. They attempt to vilely exploit the emotions and confusion that exist in part of public opinion at present, to push the entire political situation to the right, to make the situation tend towards the interests of the masses and the nation. They demand the restoration of extreme "Atlanticism," seriously violate and destroy the constitution; they hope to restore the cold war at home and abroad; they dream of new conflicts, new irreconcilable struggles, and new provocations against the workers' movement; they even madly demand to put the advanced forces of the working class and the people in an illegal position, and these advanced forces have made great contributions to the establishment of the Republic.

This obviously reactionary direction is not much different from the direction set by the recent Christian Democratic Party Congress in Trento. Everyone agrees that this congress, compared to the Naples congress that we criticized, is a retreat, since the Naples congress at least showed some democratic and reformist aspirations on the surface.

At the Christian Democratic Party Congress in Trento, all the indispensable and urgent economic and social reform issues have disappeared, and only the current leadership of the Christian Democratic Party is seen trying to strengthen its political monopoly and make it unshakable with all the means known to everyone. In line with this intention, in this government that has existed for two years, any political initiative has been stagnant. For urgent issues such as unemployment, workers' freedom, land contracts, limiting the powers of monopolies, expanding regional organizations, and abolishing measures that seriously violate the constitution, nothing has been done and no decisions have been made. There was a presidential message (the message at the inauguration of the President of the Republic—note), in which the turning point of the ruling class was announced to have arrived and the constitution was to be fully implemented; we regret to see that this voice is only a cry in the desert.

The current reactionary crusade is completely in line with the line of the Christian Democratic Party Congress in Trento, it is the implementation and development of this line. The purpose of this action is to erect an obstacle that they imagine is insurmountable, to prevent the turning point announced by the President of the Republic from being realized for a long time.

In this way, the internal contradictions of the Catholic movement are once again exposed. This movement itself has progressive elements objectively, because it marks the beginning of the participation of the laboring masses in political life and their awakening, and sometimes it shows a tendency to oppose capitalism. This tendency is spontaneously expressed by the laboring masses in their desire to defend their economic interests and improve their living conditions, but the conservative intentions from the upper classes of society oppose this tendency; for these upper-class people, the demand to oppose capitalism is only a tool to prevent the entire laboring people from achieving socialist consciousness and uniting around the revolutionary leaders of the working class.

Today, the Christian Democratic Party is undergoing a special change, it has become—like the past fascism—the party that the majority of the capitalist ruling class looks up to. Within the party, the temptation to maintain political monopoly forever has increased. In other words, a new type of totalitarianism. The Catholic Church imagines that this totalitarianism is the best guarantee for its free action, and the Catholic unity movement is the theoretical basis for free action.

The leaders of the Church are determined to obtain the results they originally wanted to achieve through deceptive electoral laws in a new form, or even by playing with electoral tricks. If these leaders realize their plan, the control of the Church will be intolerable; the life of the state organization will be more distorted than it is today.

In this situation, one can see that secular power will be subject to the Church authorities, and the main achievements of the victory of thought and culture will be threatened.

The capitalist ruling class is indifferent to these threats, and therefore they have long ceased to play a progressive role in this regard. What they are concerned about now is only to maintain their privileges and oppose socialism to preserve themselves. However, the achievements of modern civilization, the opposition to clericalism and the policy of ignorance, especially the political independence detached from clericalism, the secularization of the state, and the tolerance of various ideologies, are the fruits of the people and the victory of culture, and are achievements that must be defended. The attack of the Church is carried out under the banner of anti-communism, which in our view can only have the opposite effect and instead makes us feel honored.

This is a proof that we are fulfilling the tasks of civilization and history. The working class struggles for democracy and socialism, and in doing so, the working class also preserves the progressive achievements that have been gained. It is we who continue all the excellent traditions of civilization. Let us give a serious warning to the leaders of the middle Democratic Party, because they are currently participating in the anti-communist crusade without reservation, and some of them are even striving to become the leaders of the anti-communist crusade!

They do this, not to serve the democratic cause, and their led groups cannot benefit from it. They will only cause confusion, as I have pointed out several times in the past. Separated from the basic forces of the working class, it is separated from our forces, and fighting against it, the middle democratic forces will not receive the support we gave them in the struggle for liberation, and will inevitably be devoured, damaged, and even despised, and finally will be crushed by the clericalists.

On the Hungarian issue, we do not want to impose our opinions on anyone, although this opinion is calm and prudent. The purpose of the anti-communist crusade of the churchmen is obviously to force everyone to accept new destruction of the democratic order and abandon all social progress. Without relying on the revolutionary proletariat, democracy and the development of democracy cannot exist.

Some cultural figures who originally cooperated with us actively now claim that they cannot enter any place where we are present. We hear this and are not too surprised; we do not intend to reopen the lessons learned from tolerance in other situations.

Our Gramsci once told us how strong the ropes are that make cultural figures the tools of the ruling class; these ropes form a thin but solid net, with which the masses of the people and the middle classes can be controlled under capitalist hegemony. It is precisely these people who deny the relationship between politics and culture when they discuss with us who provide evidence to show the violent superiority of political hegemony, and this politics is controlled by the most reactionary groups.

Anti-communist propaganda can never cover up the progress of freedom. It will always be and can only be a reactionary banner, a shackle that hinders all democratic progress, a tool for retreat. All of us who do not want to be the slaves of social conservative forces and reactionary forces must beware of anti-communist propaganda in whatever form it appears.

There is a special form of anti-communist propaganda that sometimes matures among intellectual groups, and this is precisely what we want to expose; I want to call it paternalistic anti-communist propaganda, because it takes on such an appearance: they almost treat us with the attitude of protectors and guides, and thus attack our mistakes and weaknesses; but when they narrate these mistakes and shortcomings, their attitude is only the usual slander, with a little hypocrisy added. And in the end, it is an attack on Marxism, or rather, an attack on Marxists, who are said to always be backward, and now should go back to school, not to the school of the reality and practice of struggle—these new guides generally have not experienced the struggle with their own bodies—but to a new type of school of criticism based on impulse, which has never published any constructive or tenable words. They do not study and understand the rational content of our entire policy, but deliver long speeches about "state guidance," and they do not even see that they are repeating the slogans of Jedda Shearba, and even worse, and thus conspire with them.

We do not reject, we welcome and accept any invitation to open objective and friendly debates. We are ready to learn from everyone who has something to teach us, we do not reject any instruction. We have learned a lot from scientists and cultural figures, who have helped us to deeply understand the historical problems of our country, cultural currents, and the essence of our doctrine with their autonomous research. But for this paternalism that returns to the path of the anti-communist crusade, we do not see that it can be useful for anything or for anyone. Unfortunately, similar criticism, in Hungary, has made people forget the dividing line between our cause and the cause of the enemies of the working class.

We will continue to seek understanding and cooperation with the Catholic working masses, and strive to form a political alliance with the Catholic forces. Currently, we are trying to solve major political and economic problems to break the political stalemate.

Title: The Italian Communist Party's Stance on Workers, Socialism, and Political Reform
Author:

Page: 1

We do not change our stance towards the Catholic working masses. We and they will continue to seek various ways of contact, understanding, and cooperation. Currently, anti-communist propaganda is vigorously attempting to prevent such contact; this contact, in recent struggles, such as the summer struggle of agricultural workers in southern Italy, has caused great concern among landowners and reactionary forces. As a party, our clear stance on the Hungarian events and the sacred, inviolable demands of agricultural workers, railway workers, or retired workers have no relationship. However, we are well aware of the obstacles encountered in the struggle for unity to achieve these demands, and the barriers erected to prevent the realization of unity. We strive for unity, aiming to make Catholic workers understand this necessity and rise up to demand the removal of all obstacles to achieving unity in the struggle to improve living conditions.

We should use more creativity and the greatest courage to spread the fundamental truths of socialist thought among the Catholic masses, bringing us closer to conduct the current struggle. This should not be an obstacle for us but should facilitate our actions. The labor masses controlled by the Church organizations should not be seen as an impenetrable, tightly-knit group. If the founders of the workers' movement had thought this way, the socialist party would never have emerged in Italy.

Today, one sees that the vigor of the vanguard in storming the walls of old social prejudices, reactionary ideas, and political conservatism has diminished. Strangely, this diminution occurred precisely at a time when socialist thought had made such significant progress that even in the gatherings of the Catholic Action, professors, priests, and monks had to mobilize, adopting exaggerated and ineffective reservations to counter the growing belief among the masses: if everyone is to have a life worth living, the capitalist system must end.

Tricks of the mind, various provocations, and divisive propaganda can only delay this development but cannot stop it. In seeking a path to a socialist Italy, one must consider forming a political alliance with Catholic forces, starting from the opposition to capitalism, and deciding to take the necessary measures to deeply transform the Italian capitalist system.

The Church and the current leaders of the Social Democratic Party are fiercely fighting us, thereby emboldening the privileged classes in cities and villages. At this moment, our party not only presents a comprehensive program of thorough reform to the nation but also focuses on several fundamental and urgent issues to break the current political stalemate and solve several issues crucial to the political and economic progress of our country. These issues are: (1) the workers' demand for freedom and the necessary measures to address unemployment; (2) the beginning of a universal land reform; (3) the implementation of initial reforms in the industrial structure, including the nationalization of the most oppressive and harmful monopoly in the electricity sector; (4) the establishment of a universal organization across Italy; (5) the establishment of a universal social insurance system in all forms of relief and the improvement of various pension levels.

We should place the demands of the working class at the center and at the forefront.

The Italian working class is currently suffering from the cruel pressure and blows of the capitalists. The struggle to defend the rights of the working class is the minimum responsibility of every democrat. Today, the working class is suffering from the cruel pressure and blows of the capitalists. Capitalists attempt to divide the working class, make it tired, separate it from its most active leaders, and make it unaware of its revolutionary power. The working class has already initiated a massive unified trade union movement; it has vigorously conducted the necessary political activities to defend democratic freedoms; it has defended and even partially improved the wages of workers in some sectors. However, overall, if one studies the number of employed workers, labor productivity, and labor intensity, and on the other hand, if one studies the fluctuations in the profits of the bosses and the fluctuations in wages, one will find that the share of workers in the total labor income of the nation is obviously reversing. The figures proving this situation have been widely disseminated by the trade union leadership. I would like to point out that even in the sectors with the highest wages, there is still a lack of serious research on the impact of labor intensity on the health and lifespan of workers. The working class is a class that fights with all its might for democracy; no one can say that its material life has been adequately improved. Therefore, the struggle of workers' organizations to improve wages is completely justified and is the pillar of any activity to defend the economic interests of laborers.

What is the root cause of the current situation of the working class? I can point to two reasons. First, the two splits in the trade unions have made it very difficult for workers to struggle for the satisfaction of their living demands, and in some places, this struggle has even come to a standstill or can only achieve limited and sparse successes. Second, capitalists, especially in the largest enterprises, attack the working class, attempting to place it under a system of constant pressure, attempting to deprive workers of their basic rights, making them submit to the brutal actions of capitalists and their agents, persecuting and expelling the most conscious elements among workers, depriving factory committees of all their authority and dividing them, restoring conditions similar to those of the period of open reactionary rule.

Workers have resisted this attack; many national and local activities are correct and worthy of mention; however, we must admit that there has been no continuous and well-coordinated action to make full use of all the possibilities provided by the current democratic system—from economic and political strikes to parliamentary activities—and today everyone has seen the consequences of this. The worker life parliamentary investigation commissions initiated by the united actions of some of the largest industrial centers have not been properly utilized to this day. The problem is not about writing books about costs and sending them to the basement of the parliament to rot. Based on the work already done, it is now urgently necessary to consider and solve several pressing issues from the front; these issues must be solved through legislative or administrative measures as soon as possible.

I believe that the trade unions and our party will immediately formulate the necessary proposals in this regard and conduct strong propaganda in the factories, thereby reclaiming from the capitalists and the government the rights that are of vital importance to the strength of the workers' movement itself and constitute the democratic system:

Fulfillment of labor contracts, the rights of factory committees and the respect for these rights, the formulation of new employment laws that recognize the principle of dismissal only for valid reasons, prohibition of harassment, discrimination against workers, or retaliation against workers due to differences in opinion, prohibition of the establishment of police-like surveillance organizations, and effective punishment of bosses if they violate the constitution's guarantee of the rights and dignity of all citizens in the factory. The struggle to defend the rights of workers in factories is the minimum responsibility of every democrat. Any action to expand and strengthen democracy must include this struggle as one of its components. We call on the entire party, trade unions of any tendency, all workers, and all good Italian democrats to join this struggle.

Only through the class struggle of laborers can technological progress be transformed into social progress, and this is the goal of the efforts of Italian communists.

Recently, there has been extensive discussion on the attitude the working class and its organizations should take towards technological progress. During the preparation of our congress, this issue was also discussed. It has been discovered: recently, Italian production technology has progressed, and corresponding to this progress, productivity has developed in certain directions. The initial use of automated equipment has begun. This discovery is interesting, and we should collect these discoveries and be able to correctly estimate the significance of the changes and progress being realized. There is an opinion that is completely unrelated to Marxism, which claims: in the period of the general crisis of capitalism, there can be no progress in technology and economy, no advancement, and no development of productive forces; I believe that it does not take much time to refute this opinion.

Marxism only says: as long as capitalism still exists, especially today, this development is linked with opposition, antagonism, and often more serious new contradictions; Marxism requires us to focus on this point, if we do not want to make a serious mistake. In the early days of the workers' movement, there was an opinion that workers should hate technological progress because it worsens working conditions; I also believe that it does not take much time to refute this opinion.

Workers support technological progress; they see it as a means to reduce fatigue, and they themselves demand technological improvements. They are friends of technology, since technology guides them to make these improvements. There is no doubt about this. The failure to pay timely attention to the necessary attention to the technological progress being realized and to correctly estimate its significance is an error of that time. We have seriously begun to correct this error.

However, what is the most important thing for us in this regard? The most important thing is not just to acknowledge technological progress but to be able to start from this recognition to conduct the struggle of the working class in factories, in every labor sector, and across the nation to satisfy their immediate interests.

For us, learning should always be the preparation for action. The errors made in our workers' movement are that in guiding workers' struggles, we did not timely adopt the new methods required by the changes that had already occurred in the factories, and these changes created new types of wage and management relationships.

Now, we must quickly adapt to the new situation. However, the most serious mistake for worker leaders is the inability to organize and develop actions to defend income, increase income, prevent intensified exploitation, reduce this exploitation, and improve the condition of laborers themselves while technological improvements are being made. The most effective way for workers to promote technological progress is not to passively accept everything that is given to them but to develop their class struggle to satisfy their immediate demands in all circumstances. This is the driving force needed by the entire society if the entire society wants to truly progress—not in the figures of profits of the big monopolies, but in the living standards of the residents. Only through the class struggle of laborers can technological progress be transformed into social progress, and this should be our goal.

The idea that one can overcome the contradictions of capitalism, create a capitalist regime without internal contradictions, eliminate class struggle, and achieve a global paradise through technological progress—whether you call it comfortable technological progress—is a lie of reformism and a fantasy of revisionism. This doctrine is to the liking of bosses, clergy, and reactionary social democrats, and Italian workers have long seen what these ideas mean. These ideas mean a situation where attempts are made to eliminate trade unions of any tendency, destroy factory organizations, tie the hands and feet of workers, and hand them over to the bosses who decide their working conditions, wages, and living conditions.

Whether it is the similar things advocated by social democrats or the Catholic Unity Movement, this reformism, which is permeated with paternalism on the one hand and capitalist brutality on the other, cannot provide any other prospect but to maintain the rule of big monopoly capital, gradually suffocate the middle classes, and stop the social renewal needed by Italy. What we should not forget is the overall problem of the technical development of the national economy, which we have not touched upon enough. To become a technologically advanced country, one must first eliminate the phenomenon of unemployment and make all labor forces, including women's labor, useful. Some say that the "plan" of Vanoni was formulated according to this goal. However, today, no one knows what this "plan" has become. Serba said he had already realized this "plan," but Bella wants to abandon it. Sene wants to save some crumbs, some dregs.

We support the restoration of a single, democratic, large trade union organization. The central issue is to launch a mass movement to achieve economic demands and to wage a struggle to defend freedom and peace.

The unified trade union movement is not merely taking a purely negative stance towards this proposal but, in addition to the struggle to satisfy living demands, it also positively affirms its determination to achieve and establish a good government policy, which is done very well.

However, it must be understood that while calling for more production and less consumption, using public or covert wage freezes, it is not possible to eliminate unemployment or guarantee social progress. On the contrary, one should start from improving living standards, expand the domestic market, implement land reform, industrialize the south and large cities like Rome, etc. However, without taking effective measures to limit the economic power of monopoly capital and carry out necessary institutional reforms, these results cannot be achieved. We propose to start with the nationalization of the electricity monopoly enterprises, thus breaking some of the chains that hinder the economic development of the so-called "backward" regions with a new policy on electricity prices.

Regarding unemployment, our proposal is to immediately study the problem of universally reducing working hours—even if not in all cases—reducing the weekly working hours to 40 hours but without reducing wages. Experience has shown that this reform is possible due to the current technological progress; however, it can only be realized with the intervention of the government. In this way, a large number of unemployed people can quickly find jobs. These are the first steps forward.

The universal promotion of labor automation may be the prospect that is about to come. If it is promoted, it will cause the opposite result: the danger of increased unemployment and chaos will become a fact due to continuous layoffs.

I do not want to delve deeper into this topic now, but I believe that the conclusion that should be drawn is that the state should intervene in the economic sector to prevent the possible disastrous consequences.

This issue should be seriously considered by the trade unions, as in other countries. We are pleased to see this fact: the struggle movement of the peasant masses to achieve comprehensive land reform, starting from the universal limitation of land ownership, is actively unfolding in both the south and the north. Based on the current land system and different forms of agricultural operations, it will be one of the tasks of this congress to clearly define the development path for these struggles. These struggles should be expanded to all regions. The struggle to maintain the principle of permanent legitimate interests and oppose the abolition of this principle—supported by the Christian Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party—will be strongly waged in the parliament; however, to achieve success, the support of the peasant mass movement is needed, which should exceed the scope achieved so far and should have the characteristic of uniting all tenants and sharecroppers, regardless of their views or political tendencies, to participate in this movement.

In the political arena, we strive for freedom, against the violation of the constitution, against the discriminatory system, and against the bureaucratic centralism and corruption that are characteristic of the Church's rule. Today, we should concentrate our efforts to demand a real reform of the political structure. While abolishing the prefect system and expanding local administrative autonomy, the universal promotion of regional autonomy is one of the main reforms at present.

The following situation is completely intolerable: a minister, in response to our proposals, dares to say that reforms cannot be carried out because they would harm the ruling party. The constitution does not guarantee this structural reform, but the constitution clearly stipulates that structural reform should be carried out. A minister dares to speak in this way, disregarding the clear provisions of the constitution, and should be prosecuted. One cannot rule out the possibility that we will raise the issue of the responsibility of some ministers in the parliament based on the judgment of the constitutional court—even criminal responsibility—because they have deliberately violated the constitution and enacted some strange laws over the years.

Is there sufficient force today to forcefully implement such a democratic program—even if it is a limited program? I will repeat, there will be a period of arduous struggle ahead. The leaders and the parties currently in power, even in the best of cases, mostly seek to maintain the current state of stagnation. Christian Democrats take this stance to further tighten their political monopoly; right-wing parties take this stance to advance in a more reactionary direction. The infamous tripartite alliance of industrial and agricultural big capital seeks to rule the nation without supervision. Before the appearance of some new factors, the possibility of taking effective action starting from the highest level of contact and agreement is quite limited. The idea of considering "leftward development" as an activity that is achieved at the highest level is at least, in our view, especially the error of the socialists, but partially also one of our errors. Contact at the highest level is both possible and will have results, but it depends on the struggle to gain public support for a clear program and the effective struggle of the working class and the advanced sections of the people to achieve major economic and political demands, to achieve the most profound necessary reforms. If we are to break free from the state of stagnation, repel the new threats of reactionary forces, and shatter the monopoly of the Christian Democrats, thereby creating a new political situation, today we must still fully achieve all the above points.

Therefore, we must also refute the ideas filled with pessimism or hoping for miracles. The former believes that the possibility of new progress and development of Italian democracy has disappeared; while the latter believes that the alliance of political forces—such as the unity of the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party, regardless of how it is prepared and achieved—is sufficient to reverse the situation. We also oppose the stance of some people: considering the difficulties faced by the entire trade union movement in the face of the stubborn resistance and attacks of the reactionary bourgeoisie, they believe that solving the problem of trade union unity is a necessary condition, without which it is not possible to take further action to achieve living demands and defend the rights of workers.

We believe that the center of everything is: the mass movement; the struggle of the working class, peasants, producing middle classes, and the majority of the people to achieve economic demands, defend freedom and peace. The unity of laborers is the most effective tool for organizing this movement and these struggles, and for promoting their victory. Therefore, we must strive for, defend, and develop the unity of laborers, and never let it be destroyed.

Therefore, we unreservedly support the restoration of a single, democratic, large trade union organization, which will accept all labor forces in Italy to oppose the capitalists, without any constraints from parties and governments, transcending all ideological and political differences, and excluding all forms of discrimination. We support the stance of our trade union leaders to restore such a great unified organization. The restoration of unity should not favor our organization, nor should it favor any other trade union faction or political faction. The restoration of unity should enable the working class to achieve new great victories, like the achievement of wage adjustments according to prices in the past. The restoration of unity should enable workers to raise their awareness of their own strength and their responsibilities in democracy and progress.

The Italian Republican Party and the Socialist Party should maintain unity and cooperation. We support the reunification of the Socialist Party. The Social Democratic Party should abandon its divisive and anti-communist stance.

Regarding the political aspect, after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, we start from the recognition of the existence of new conditions, which not only require but also make it possible to achieve new progress in the unity of the working class and all organized forces based on socialist principles. These conditions still exist very realistically, despite the current reactionary offensive launched by the leaders of the Social Democratic Party, who try to cover up the facts and engage in sabotage, thereby making the split permanent. The trend towards reunification of the Socialist Party in Italy proves that these conditions have always existed.

In our country, there are two working-class parties that adhere to socialist principles: our party and the Italian Socialist Party. These two parties have already achieved mutual understanding, harmony, and close cooperation over the past decade. This achievement has deeply entered the minds of enterprise workers and rural workers, and it has decisively helped the working class and the people achieve victories in their struggles. The forms of cooperation at various stages are different. The forms of cooperation cannot but change with the environment. It is wrong to simply refer to the unified action of the two parties as "frontism." Like the organization of an electoral front in 1948, this is just one form of cooperation. However, after the Socialist Party, with our brotherly help, overcame the crisis caused by the split of the social democrats and the results of several consecutive elections, there was no more "frontism," only cooperation. This cooperation not only allows but also requires full mutual autonomy, since our stance and the stance of the Socialist Party differ on many issues. We have never treated these differences maliciously. Since we are united in fundamental goals and in the methods of democratic struggle, we have achieved unity and cooperation in decisive political movements and class struggles, even without written agreements.

This situation should continue, because we believe that between two parties like ours and the Socialist Party, brotherly relations should be maintained, and mutual contact should be maintained whenever necessary, cooperation should be maintained in the mass organizations in which both parties participate, and unity should be maintained in the struggle against common enemies—who are the enemies of the working class, democracy, and socialism. This does not exclude mutual autonomy and friendly mutual criticism, but rather takes this as a condition.

The Social Democratic Party is also derived from the main trunk of the past socialist movement; however, since its establishment, it has always been hostile to the unity of class forces, willingly joining the line to defend capitalism, maintain Atlantic despotism, engage in anti-democratic discrimination, anti-communist provocations, and ideological and political strife. The social democratic parties in Europe, with the Italian Social Democratic Party being the worst. I believe that the Socialist comrades cannot disagree with this assessment. From this, one cannot but draw the conclusion: since the split caused by the social democrats has been overcome, the political stance adopted by the Social Democratic Party from the time of the split to today should be firmly abandoned—the political stances of the Social Democratic Party have even reached the point of joining the government that carried out the restoration of capitalism and the massacre of laborers, formulating deceptive laws, participating in the Serba government, and opposing the election of the current President of the Republic. Especially, the coarsely anti-communist propaganda, which has been used as an excuse for any split action, should be abandoned simultaneously.

Today, we do not see the conditions for the establishment of a single Italian workers' party guided by socialist thought. However, we do not believe that these conditions cannot be created. We will strive to create these conditions, and if these conditions exist in the future, we will not oppose this broader unity.

However, if today the stance of the Social Democratic Party is still maintained, allowing it to dominate in the newly unified Socialist Party and become the guiding ideology, then from the perspective of more effectively fighting capitalism and for socialism, this unified action will have a negative meaning. It will no longer be an action to promote unity. To call the destruction of the already achieved unity "unity" is absurd. The workers' movement will be harmed, and it will fall into confusion for a certain period. The reactionary forces will benefit from this. Therefore, from the beginning, we have declared: we support the reunification of the Socialist Party, and we support the reunification that is part of the process of unity, promoting the restoration of unity in a new form, rather than an action with the opposite content.

We also have reason to worry—please allow the Socialist comrades to make this friendly criticism—that from the beginning, there has not been a clear statement that reunification will not mean the acceptance of the political stance of the Social Democratic Party (anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, and everything else that we are very familiar with). The issue is not just not condemning or refuting the policy that the Socialist Party has been pursuing so far, a policy that is correct and that people see is correct, since the prestige and strength of the Socialist Party and the entire workers' movement have been strengthened as a result.

The issues raised in the past have reappeared today and will reappear tomorrow. In today's atmosphere of renewed cold war that is spreading around the world, new struggles must be waged with the same vigor as in the past, and their goals will not be much different. However, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party have already taken a stance opposite to the stance that the forces of peace and progress should have. In our view, it is absurd to think that the reunification of the Socialist Party could mean that the huge working and laboring masses following the Socialist Party would stand on this stance. However, the leaders of the Social Democratic Party seem to think so. They are proud of the mistakes they have exploited and are supported by all the enemies of socialism.

We do not want to be alienated from our Socialist comrades at this time or at any other time; our criticism does not have this intention; these criticisms do not mean that we want to interfere in their party affairs. However, we believe that maintaining unity and waging the struggle against the right-wing thought and policy of the Social Democratic Party—the root cause of the most serious defeats suffered by the workers' movement from 1914 to today—is for the common interests of our party and the Socialist Party. To maintain their interests and advance on the path to socialism, the working class should unite its forces rather than divide them. Isolating the most advanced part of the workers—the communists—means condemning the entire working mass to internal division, loss of direction, and chaos; and because of the strength of our party, because of the traditions, unity, and prestige we possess, this is especially true for our country.

We strive to establish a democratic government of the working class, which relies on the massive organizations of laborers, upholds the constitution, defends peace, implements an economic system that defends labor, and opens the way for socialist renewal.

The working class maintains and strengthens its unity, not to isolate itself, but to create better conditions for contact and cooperation with other democratic and progressive forces. Because the working class thus has the ability to win in battle, and this is not only for its current interests but also for a comprehensive plan of renewal.

Only in this way can favorable conditions be created for the participation of the working class and laborers in government and national leadership, making them the ruling force as they should be.

From the beginning of the preparation of our congress, we have proposed the slogan—establish a democratic government of the working class—which starts from and signifies this. We use this slogan to specify a concrete and achievable goal, which is to establish a government that embodies a broad political agreement and alliance, and this agreement and alliance represent the majority of laboring people and their trade union and political organizations. The possible forms of the parliamentary basis of such a government do not need to be discussed at present, since we also face a parliament: although its term has not yet expired, it seems to have no political ability to carry out reforms.

The goal we have set out provides specific ways to achieve change, and this change aims to renew the ruling class and make laborers participate in the leadership of the nation. Regarding the latter point, people have talked about it a lot and are still talking about it. The program is clear; the actions that this government should take are also clear.

The democratic government of the working class should be a government that maintains peace, strives for international and domestic détente, and vigorously defends our independence. This government should be a government that fully implements and upholds the constitution, restores trade union rights, and respects the dignity of laborers in the workplace.

This government should implement the economic system that defends labor, as discussed in the recent congress of the General Confederation of Labor.

This government should implement universal land reform, eliminate unemployment, vigorously fight poverty, establish a modern social insurance system for laboring men and women, and begin the necessary structural reforms that are urgently needed.

This government should eliminate all discrimination, implement control over private industrial and financial monopolies within the scope of political democracy, thereby destroying their current absolute power.

This government should rely on the massive organizations of workers, peasants, artisans, employees, youth, and all laborers.

This government should be trusted by laborers, the poor, and those who have been oppressed until now.

This government should implement the republican constitution, thereby opening the way for socialist renewal in our society.

Party Life

All issues directly related to the life and activities of the party should be considered from the recognition that in Italy, we are the largest force, and we belong to the democratic and workers' movement camp. We are the largest force, not only because of the number of our party members and the votes we received in elections, but also because of our prestige in thought and action; therefore, despite being in the opposition, we have played a decisive role in certain important aspects of national policy. This superiority, even our opponents and enemies acknowledge, despite their shouting and inciting against us. From this, one can see that our responsibilities are extremely heavy. There have been attempts to separate the basic masses of the people, workers, impoverished residents of the south, and all those oppressed by the most impoverished living conditions, as well as the middle-class laborers who increasingly feel the need for economic renewal, from us, but these attempts have not succeeded. In some places, our positions have been partially weakened. However, this weakening cannot be seen as a sign of a situation that cannot be reversed even with intensified efforts. On the contrary, it is precisely in the past few weeks that a part of the more class-conscious and active workers and masses of the people have rallied around us more tightly under the fierce attacks of the enemy.

Our common correct belief is that this force is naturally the result of all our activities within the workers' movement, the result of struggling with heroic spirit and spirit of sacrifice, with fundamentally meaningful revolutionary unity over more than thirty years, and this force is closely related to the nature that our party has possessed since 1945.

Women's Issues

As we said at the time, this nature is already a new thing. It includes: completely abandoning the old sectarian stance; criticizing the idea of the party as a limited, semi-military organization; a new leap in recruiting party members; new organizational forms and working methods. It especially includes unremitting efforts to maintain close ties with all classes of the people, so that we can handle issues and fight within the democratic scope to solve all issues related to laboring people—if one wants to lead the working class and the people to persist in the struggle for democracy and socialism, these issues are very important. Regarding the party's concept of this nature, in our view, it is very clear, and we have clearly expressed this concept in our fundamental documents. This concept is certainly supported by comrades and has entered their minds. However, if we say: this concept has already been fully realized in all aspects of our actions without reservation and without encountering resistance, and this realization has not often been, and even seriously, restricted, and this restriction has not become an obstacle to the effectiveness of our policy—if we say this, we would be wrong. We say that in our party's general line, there is a certain "duality," and our starting point is to think of this resistance, these restrictions, and the errors arising from them. The word "duality" may not sound good because it seems to contain a moral criticism. However, it is certain that: since certain errors are repeatedly committed in the same action, one cannot but have the impression that in the party's line, there is an actual but not openly displayed disagreement.

Take, for example, one of the unique situations of our political line and organization: the issue of the women's movement. As early as twelve years ago, it was already announced: in Italy, the task is to strive for the liberation of women, which is one of the central issues of democracy and the advance towards socialism, and we should strive to develop a broad, autonomous, democratic women's movement, and its purpose should be the liberation of women. Therefore, it is necessary to pay special attention to all women's issues, especially to the recruitment of women party members, to their participation in trade unions and women's organizations; it is also necessary to make special efforts to study the issues of women, the cultivation, and promotion of women cadres. Indeed, there has been progress on this road, but it has been with great effort!

There is a mistaken view that there are no special women's issues, and in trade union struggles and political struggles, women only play a supporting role; we have had to refute this view hundreds of times.

We have had to eliminate stubborn reactionary prejudices within the party, prejudices that even deny the necessity of the existence of a women's mass organization with its own tasks. This makes one feel that the party is a party that only advocates correct things but does nothing about these correct things and instead takes wrong actions. Is this—neglect, incompetence, or secret refusal to support the political line? Supporting a political line does not depend on words, but on the efforts to realize it.

Municipal and Parliamentary

We have always placed the demand and defense of local autonomy at the center of our political demands. The current problems are numerous and very important, and many urgent and personal issues can be solved within the scope of local administration. The entire party agrees with this stance and of course accepts it with confidence. However, how to explain the fact that so many active members of the party only pay attention to local administration issues at election time, so that even if they do not lose the positions they have fought for, they cannot seize positions from the enemy?

In our entire political strategy and tactics, the importance of the parliament has been timely known and agreed upon. However, except for a few decisive battles, the use of the parliament has not reached the level of this political action line. The entire party machinery does not include parliamentary work, nor does it give it the necessary attention. The central machinery itself is not always able to issue effective instructions. Let us hope that the recent resolution of the parliamentary group on parliamentary tasks, especially on the tasks of our deputies, will become the starting point for a major correction.

Weaknesses in Work

Everyone knows that in all meetings of the leadership organs or local party organizations, it is emphasized that we must work even among social strata that are alienated from the working class and among labor forces that still oppose us. In this regard, a large number of initiatives have been implemented, and often with good results and achievements, such as the work done for mountain residents, artisans, employees, pensioners, war victims, etc.

However, it cannot be denied that this work is fragmented and intermittent. The work for small land cultivators has been almost neglected, and these cultivators especially need guidance to free themselves from the control of the Church and businessmen, who regard these cultivators as objects for their own hunting. For example, although there is much talk and writing about the need to hold talks with Catholic labor masses, the approach to and struggle for the Catholic labor masses has been done very little and intermittently, and in the Catholic labor masses, there are people who are constantly seeking new paths of struggle against the existing system. However, wherever the approach and struggle work has been done, important achievements have been obtained.

However, even in our work to consolidate, develop, strengthen, and maintain the ties between the party and the working class, have we not seen serious shortcomings in the discovery and correction of delays in this work, which should be our main work, and which have been painfully exposed in the recent factory elections? The labor front in the factory is the party's main front. However, this is a multi-faceted front. The situation has not been fully utilized, and the trade union struggle has not been completed. Today, this struggle is often very arduous and often does not achieve the expected results. The party organization should carry out propaganda, mobilization, and organizational work in difficult times, but it should make every struggle, even if it does not end in complete victory, contribute to the awakening of the working class, making them show more determination: organize, unite, and confront the exploiters with a stronger and more effective action front. Every party organization should be able to always be one with the laborers and have a clear work plan to fulfill this task and lead the workers' struggles.

One can make even severe criticisms of other aspects of our work, more or less important, and there will certainly be such a situation during the congress. However, when we say that the congress should strengthen the party, when we emphasize these two tasks and closely link them together, do we mean only: one must advocate criticism and self-criticism to expose all mistakes and demand that the party correct them? No, that is not the case. You remember that the fourth national conference was prepared as carefully as for a congress, and if this national conference is not completely satisfactory, it is also far from only proposing criticisms. On this occasion, criticisms were often firmly and forcefully proposed, and the solutions pointed out were generally correct, but a large part of them have never been implemented. In this congress, there will also be many criticisms of all aspects of our work, and this should be done. However, when we talk about reform, we obviously mean something other than criticism.

To make everyone understand this, it is not useless to review the developments of recent years. After the victory over the (electoral) fraudulent laws, the nation and our party faced a new situation. It cannot be said that the party central did not understand this. It is enough to review the meeting we held in October 1953. At this meeting, it was demanded that the party, taking advantage of the victory, vigorously carry out various forms of broad activities aimed at all classes of laboring people, and based on their current interests and the necessity of implementing a new policy of broad reforms that everyone understands. At that time, the party did not lack a line, but what was lacking was the spirit to implement this policy. At that time, there was also a lack of deep belief in the correctness of this policy. Thus, indecision was shown, and the changes that had already occurred in the economic and other aspects were not given timely attention. During the Serba administration, there were many significant initiatives and struggles, and this period ended with the victory of democratic forces and our party. However, it cannot be denied: after 1953, generally speaking, our political initiative was once weaker, and the party was once closed off.

From this criticism, one can very clearly see what we demand for reform today. The line of reform of the party is purely an external line, and this line includes the political activities of the party and its working methods. It cannot become a mere whip. It first involves a more perfect and better formulation of our political program to achieve a deeper exploration of the path to a socialist Italy. It involves a more detailed analysis of the driving forces of democratic reform and socialist revolution. It involves more broadly and freely seeking allies for the working class in the struggle against the power of big monopolies. It is related to affirming the structural reforms we demand, the value of these reforms, and the means to obtain them. It is related to our once again placing universal land reform at the forefront, for which the working class is struggling, and for which the peasants are also struggling. It is related to better understanding our democratic methods of action and the best understanding of the value of democracy in the process of advancing towards socialism.

For the struggle to realize the line of the party and to achieve the path to a socialist Italy, the center of the reform work of the party is to overcome two main obstacles: the sectarianism of the highest program faction and the revisionism of the reformist faction. The former closes the door and waits for good fortune to come; the latter kneels before capitalism and waits for capitalism to turn into socialism. Both reject revolutionary action to achieve socialism. We have felt the influence of the latter in some comrades' assessments of the new events currently occurring in the world. The former is more deeply rooted in our ranks, due to past experiences and the old traditions of our movement. The harm that reformism can do to the working class is the most serious, because reformism extinguishes the revolutionary spirit and leads to passivity. However, a sectarian party that closes the door cannot effectively fight reformism, such a party is a party that does not fully believe in the correctness of its political line and cannot struggle to realize this political line. Therefore, the individual struggles to eliminate these obstacles are interconnected and mutually conditional. Seeking the ways to express this struggle and the ways to conduct this struggle should be linked to the correct understanding of the tasks of the party and the realization of the tasks of the party. This connection has not been correctly emphasized and valued in all the recent provincial committee congresses, and wherever this situation occurs, it is a serious shortcoming.

Just as I said everything, one can understand the great importance of the issues related to the internal life and activities of the party. The partial phenomena of inability to realize the correct policy that I condemn and the sectarian tendency to close the door manifest themselves in the party in the form of bureaucratic rigidity and restrictions on working methods and democratic life. Therefore, it is known that to strengthen the political level and working ability of the entire party, one should concentrate on this direction. Therefore, this has become the main task within the party.

The serious problems raised by the revelations and conclusions of the 20th Congress, once they are placed before the party and the workers' movement, cannot be mixed with some of our own problems, and thus the necessity of reform is completely revealed.

The debates conducted before the congress are already a new thing, and we believe it has highly positive significance. Through this debate, the party saw what dangers threatened it: the positions that actually agreed with the wrong and slanderous positions of the enemy but appeared in the guise of not agreeing with authority infiltrated the ranks of the party, some revisionist views appeared, and some irresponsible defeatist tendencies appeared, which are all deviations from our principles and incorrect evaluations of the rich thoughts and work that constitute our wealth. The party responded well to these dangers, repelled them, and united to seek its own path of reform. The debate was conducted extensively and freely, as has not been seen in any party for a long time. To say that the participation of intellectual comrades in the debate had a negative effect, or to say that some condemnations caused more serious panic and despair among them than among others, is not true. Some of them were more anxious than others and showed a tendency towards sectarian activities that violated discipline, but then overcame this situation. On the contrary, this showed that intellectual comrades need to establish closer relations with the entire life of the party in normal organizations, make greater contributions to this life, and not just contribute in large debate gatherings.

The French comrades criticized us for supposedly making unnecessary and incorrect concessions to those who took wrong positions. We have not made any concessions; we are aware of the seriousness of the various issues that have been raised; we have condemned factional activities and indiscipline, and made those who took such actions also condemn their activities and behavior; for those who have differing opinions, we have conducted free discussions with them to convince them and bring them to our correct political stance. So far, the results have been positive, and the methods have been correct, because this is the normal leadership method used by a party that hopes to build the unity and strength of its members on conscious and rational agreement, rather than on obedience.

The communication of thoughts within the entire party must be conducted from two aspects: both from top to bottom and from bottom to top. It is not possible to demand that thoughts, opinions, and suggestions from below can only be presented as perfect and always completely correct. Discussion is used to develop these thoughts, opinions, and suggestions, and to draw all necessary conclusions from them. We adopt this approach because we are aware that this form of communication of thoughts is still quite lacking in our ranks, although we have said a lot and made many decisions to promote it. Those comrades who have not been fully convinced and believe that the policy of the party is correct will find it difficult to strive for its realization. Therefore, the call to advocate party democracy and the call to struggle to eliminate the artificial restrictions on party democracy are calls to achieve greater political effectiveness, calls for the vast majority of comrades to further strengthen their activities, and therefore, it is to enable us to better accomplish all our tasks.

It is precisely for this reason that our action to strive for reform has such great significance. Only through this action can we advance, advance victoriously, even if the environment is very difficult.

We hope to remove the remnants that have surfaced due to the behavior of inexperienced comrades and can only hinder our reform action. In the discussion of the issues of the life of our party and the issues of communication of thoughts in our ranks, some positions have been smuggled in, and I believe these positions are remnants. First of all, for example, "factional activities," which violate the principles of discipline and the unity of the party, and the unity of the party is the basis of the strength of the party, to achieve the unity of the party, one must follow the democratic centralism principles stipulated in our party constitution. Again, for example, the demand to organize factions within the party, and this thing is not conducive to the communication of thoughts, it will only hinder the communication of thoughts, and it will reduce democratic life to an unacceptable form of parliamentary strife. The above are remnants of a very wrong leadership method (this error may be unconscious): one of the manifestations of this wrong leadership method is the demand to use methods characteristic of warlordism, that is, as long as a cadre makes a mistake, regardless of his ability, he must be absolutely excluded from work. To cultivate experienced party cadres, one cannot do this, but should help comrades to correct mistakes and improve work after criticism, and strengthen unity in the struggle to maintain our policy. Again, for example, cadres who dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the work of the party with noble self-sacrificing spirit are subjected to unacceptable complaints. Let us unhesitatingly discard these smuggled goods!

Regarding the secret ballot for the election of the leadership organs, the newspapers have said a lot. Our party constitution has always guaranteed this secrecy (as long as a request is made), and this will also be the case at this meeting. However, it must be reminded that what guarantees the democracy of the party is not this or that voting method, but the way the entire party works.

In the old Socialist Party, the distribution of seats of various factions within the party at the congress was often realized through apparent voting.

The Communist Party of Italy is a revolutionary party leading the Italian working class to liberation. Its task is to fight against class enemies, organize the political and economic movements of the working class, struggle for democracy and socialism.

We are not a party of debaters, but a revolutionary party established for action and for struggle. We are such a party of a class: this class is oppressed and exploited today, and it needs strong and united leaders to fight for liberation. We are such a party: it should complete increasingly renewed and increasingly broad tasks according to the development of the movement. For this, we should have an organization that is always effective, and we should rely on intelligent, capable revolutionary cadres of the party to maintain this organization. Let a new wave of these cadres be launched from the factories, from the countryside, from the schools to promote the reform we hope for! Let us reduce the number of leadership organs where necessary and absorb active workers and laborers from production to participate in political leadership and practical leadership! Let us simplify the work, so that the work is more effective! Let us study more, work hard, and wage struggles among the people, at the forefront of the people! Only through a lively, democratic party of laborers and fighters, the struggle for democracy and socialism can be carried out.

All tasks are thus combined, that is, to better master our doctrine, conduct theoretical and practical explorations, understand new things and things that are constantly emerging, understand things that need to be judged unanimously and acted upon appropriately, be vigilant and fight against class enemies, organize the political and economic movements of the working class, struggle for democracy and socialism, create the tools needed by the proletariat and the people to struggle for democracy and socialism.

Let the illusions of our enemies be shattered! The reason we encounter difficulties, the reason we always discuss, the reason we always debate new issues, is because we have reached a new stage of our development, and new, vast prospects have opened up before us.

The socialist world is advancing. The socialist world is constantly renewing itself. The banners of freedom, social progress, and peace are in the hands of the steadfast. Our party is advancing on the path that has been determined. We have worked tirelessly and loyally for the party for so many years, and we are proud to have completed the task assigned to us by history by establishing the Communist Party! Let us confidently express our confidence in this party, the product of the working class, which is good at leading the working class and all the people of Italy to build a democratic and socialist society with victory!

Long live the Communist Party of Italy!

Long live the international unity of laborers!

Long live democracy, socialism, and peace!

    为走向社会主义的意大利道路，为劳动阶级的民主政府而奋斗！
    陶里亚蒂同志在意共第八次代表大会上就第一项议程所作的报告全文（续昨）
    走向社会主义的意大利道路
    我们走向社会主义的时候，应当遵循意大利的道路。这个论点是筹备代表大会工作的中心，也是中央委员会向各位代表提请批准的文件的中心。
    意共自从开始摆脱教条的和无力的旧宗派主义以来，即努力制定一条正确地符合国内形势和进行阶级斗争的政治路线。
    我不再重复已经多次广泛提到的我们党自从开始摆脱教条的和无力的旧宗派主义以来所关心的事项，即愈来愈强烈地关心到制定出一条正确地符合我国形式和在这种形势下进行阶级斗争的条件的政治路线。在大战期间和解放以后，同其他许多党相比，具有我们党的特征的一个真正的政治方针就是从这个关心产生出来的，我们采取的主要立场和我们主要的行动都是根据这个方针来的。这些主要立场和行动是：我们的民族团结政策，在工人运动中我们同社会党关系的本质，对天主教人民运动中积极因素的注意，在起草宪法宪章的时候我们所起的决定性作用，出名的宪法第七条的表决（这是指关于国家与教会之间关系的宪法第七条——译注）——就是说同意同天主教教会签订的条约和清算旧的反天主教主义，协助起草总工会的“劳动计划”，肯定城乡、特别是南方西西里岛和撒丁岛进行的，而我们曾经参加的大部分群众斗争的内容和性质，强调解放妇女的必要性，研究青年一代的问题以及他们的任务。在围绕着外交政策问题而进行的反对战争威胁的斗争中，我们不断地努力引导这种斗争，使它具有民族的内容、具有保卫我们的独立和肯定我国信誉的内容，并使它同我们整个的总方针相结合。
    有些人说这些各种各样的政治行动是我们的策略，就是说单纯是我们的计谋。这表明了他们丝毫不了解所谈的事情的本质，在党内也必须用认真的论据去反对这样一些人：这些人认为寻找意大利的道路，只是便于争取大多数从而便于发展整个运动的一个权宜办法而已。完全不是那么一回事。它牵涉到社会主义革命在现实中提出问题的方式本身。摧毁资本主义机构和创立社会主义机构的必要性，既不是从决定也不是从技巧中产生的，也不是从阶级工会运动的力量中产生的。它是体现着目前社会的真正力量和主观力量的发展和矛盾的产物。就是这种发展和矛盾使得社会主义的过程在历史上是必要的，以致可以说社会主义就在资本主义内部客观地成熟。因此成熟的条件和形式只能是随着地点的不同和历史上时间的不同而有所不同，这是很明显的。就拿资本主义制度来说，不仅它的内容，而且它的结构也都是各异的。在不同的国度里生产力的发展达到的程度是不同的，同时生产关系的调整在总的方面说来也是不同的，虽然总的方面在资本主义成为统治因素的国家里大致上是相同的。城乡的关系不是一律同样的，它是常常随着资产阶级的革命的程度而变更的，独立的中、小生产者的比重和性质不是一律相同的，文化的传统也不是一律相同的。这些差异性决定了国家的结构、领导集团的性质以及阶级斗争的条件和方式。甚至整个资本主义世界所共有的变化（例如大垄断集团今天的向前发展就是这种情况），并不是到处都是以同样的方式实现的，也不能产生同样的实际后果，而且不会在到处都提出同样的问题。
    向社会主义发展的道路的多样性是从历史、经济、工人运动的发展中产生的，而且人们往往发现这种运动的自发性本身就是多样的。问题归结为工人阶级的领导应该估计到这一点，至少应该使无产阶级的整个先锋队意识到这一点，因此，它应该不脱离各国互不相同的、只有它们才能保证整个运动的根本团结和取得成就的政策方针和工作方法。
    意共的缔造者正确地提出和解决了意大利工人阶级的斗争同南部和岛屿地区农民的斗争汇合成统一的运动的问题。
    因此，安东尼奥·葛兰西在我们拟订在第三次全国代表大会上提出的纲领时，曾经希望人们强调指出这样一点：对意大利资本主义组织进行的双重打击——正在形成和正在发展的工人阶级的打击以及南部和岛屿上农民群众的打击——正表现出、并趋向于汇合为一个统一的运动，在社会党领导考虑到这一点之前固然是如此，而另一方面，在这个领导对于南部地区产生的和西西里的运动所提出的严重问题置若罔闻的时候也是如此。新意大利国家自身的矛盾决定了我们这个历史阶段中阶级斗争的发展的特殊条件，这些矛盾从一开始就产生了必然会变成意大利社会主义革命的动力的条件。工人运动只是在很迟的时候才正确地了解到问题的这些内容，而这种了解应该归功于葛兰西。
    我们在摆脱阻碍我们的公式主义的同时，一直努力继续忠实于这位缔造我们党的伟大人物的这一个根本的首要教训以及作为这个教训的组成部分的方法。
    中部社会的落后和分崩离析状态，南部和岛屿地区同意大利其他地区之间的不平衡状态，以及这种状态对农村劳动群众、中等阶层和甚至对一部分有产阶层产生的严重影响，都是意大利资本主义经济政治结构的特殊产物。这些情况是不是会随着资本主义的发展、随着工业生产和技术的进展而消灭呢？到目前为止所得到的结果是它们并没有消灭；恰恰相反，这些情况还有部分地变得更加严重的趋向。那末，是不是应该等待这些情况随着社会主义革命而消灭呢？不，这将是宿命论和消极等待的错误，这是不管想用多么漂亮的词句都不能掩饰的。单单指责这些情况是不够的，今天还应该号召劳动群众来对这些情况进行斗争，向他们具体地指出怎样用普遍进行土地改革、使南部地区迅速工业化和扩大区域自治制度的方法来使这些情况归于消灭。因此，问题在于要掀起一个不仅是地方性的、而且是全国性的运动，以便进行这种深刻的改革。这样，我们这个工人阶级的政党就变成了也是南部劳动人民的政党，我国真正唯一的南方人党。
    但是，葛兰西本人在分析意大利农民问题的内容时就已经扩大了政治视野，他当时说，梵蒂冈的问题，就是说天主教运动的问题，是农民问题的组成部分。在这个问题上，人们无疑地已在好些方面取得了进展。天主教运动今天已比过去成熟了。但是，为了为农民们创造新的生活条件而采取的革命性行动和倡议，在移居的农民群众、佃农和中小地主中一直是不够的、片断的和混乱的。造成这种情况，特别是因为今天山区农业的没落提出了若干新问题，这些问题在某些点上同南部的问题相似。整整一部分国民经济、因而也就是整整一部分居民陷入了穷困状态，而人们却听见歌颂资本主义的人在卖弄山区人口的减少，就是说在卖弄贫穷，说什么这是目前社会进步的一个方面。
    在都市中，生活着人数相当多的中产阶级，这是在其他资本主义发达的西方国家中也存在的；而且还存在着保留古老传统的许多手工业者，这是我们所特有的。这些阶层在感觉到自己同反对资本主义的斗争息息相关之前，是不是由于它们的本质决定它们要反对向社会主义前进呢？这些阶层又是不是非得首先被迫破产和被迫变成无产阶级不可呢？
    这两种说法都不对。他们是这样的一部分劳动人民：固然由于他们的存在，才有一种特殊的社会结构，但是，由于他们的生活条件往往十分艰苦，不彻底改革这种结构，他们就不能求得解放，因此他们同时也憎恨这种社会结构。现在的资本主义已经不像过去的资本主义，不过，在当前演变中，它还保留着固有的特性。在我国这种很特别的社会环境中，资本主义在发展中把工业、财政和农业大垄断集团的支配优势同不可否认的技术进步，同生产发展，同国民收入微乎其微的、根本不平衡的增长结合起来了。因此，我们看见的是这样一种片面的畸形增长：它不能消除以往的矛盾，充其量只是以新的形式、往往更深刻的形式把矛盾呈现出来，它不能消除过去的对立，充其量只是促使新的对立、往往更尖锐的对立产生。
    意大利整个社会、经济结构已经深深腐朽。彻底改变经济结构，这是社会主义革命的任务。当前迫切必要的是：改善居民生活，实行土地改革，削弱大垄断集团的权力。
    整个社会、经济体制结构已经深深腐朽。某些事实已经有力地揭发了这种情况。这些事实中最严重的是：经常有大约二百万人完全失业，而就业不足的劳动者人数也差不多，而且这种情况还是发生在这样的时候：人们正在大事渲染经济主要部门生产指数的上升。某些无疑问地可以当作进步现象的事实，例如农业中大规模采用机械之类，却趋向于再把成千上万的人从土地劳动中排挤出去，从而使得上述情况悲惨地恶化。大多数妇女没有参加生产，因此，极大量的劳动力未得利用。人们偶而下定决心要稍稍注意一下全体居民生活的实际情况，他们就举行官方调查，只有这时才透露出其他事实；然而对于人民，对于同人民一起生活的人说来，这些事实总是存在的。例如，全国各地——不仅南方、西西里岛和撒丁岛，而且各山谷，甚至北方各平原和大城市附近——普遍的贫困状况就是这样。资本主义西方其他国家文明生活和我国文明生活之间的惊人的不平衡状态和巨大的悬殊也是这种情况。我们常常列在最末位，我国的这种严重的真正的落后，只比西班牙、土耳其、希腊和十分落后的中东国家略胜一筹。经济上同过去来比，也要得出惊人的结论。居民每人可以获得的卡洛里，比起1911——1913年和第二次世界大战以前来说，增加得极少。即使考虑到所比较的时期情况有所差异，也不得不得出结论说：尽管十年来的工会斗争和政治斗争已经做到遏制住企图降低工业劳动者各重要阶层生活水平的倾向，但对全体人民来说却不能否认贫困化的趋势仍然存在。
    整个情况是：经济制度不能保证生产力持续不断地合理发展，不能使得全体公民有工作做，不能使我们克服根深蒂固的矛盾和落后。因此，不仅工人感到改变这种制度结构本身的必要性，而且大多数居民通过各种途径，也感到有此必要。彻底改变经济结构，这就是社会主义革命的任务。但是，今天绝对迫切必要的还有部分性的改革工作，假如我们希望让全体居民生活改善，就不能延迟这种改革：例如，从普遍限制土地所有权入手，来实施全面土地改革；再如，采取最为迫切的措施来削弱大垄断集团的权力。
    工业金融垄断资本对于意大利经济的压力已经增长得十分骇人，而且比其他资本主义国家增长得迅速，造成的不平衡也更为严重。
    数字是大家已经知道的。现在有成千上万的股份公司，而70％的股票资本是集中在其中的一八○家手中。而这一八○家中，四○家控制着整个意大利股票资本的三分之二，而0.015％的股东拥有资本总额的半数。大垄断集团支配金融市场和操纵物价是不容否认的，其势力是压人的。最大的各个公司从1948年到1954年获得的公开利润，增长数字平均是在30％上下，绝对数字都是天文数字。
    今天，为了维护绝大部分居民的生产活动（其中包括中小生产者阶层，他们的收益由于大垄断资本操纵市场而减少），对私人大垄断资本进行有效的斗争不但涉及当前利益，而且甚至是一种必要。垄断资本是现阶段资本主义的领导力量。这是一支最有侵略性的、最反动的力量。垄断资本是威胁民族独立的国际勾结的维护者。集中火力打击大垄断资本，使它处于被告地位，使它孤立，设法采取措施限制它的权力、然后予以消灭，这是凡是决意同日益广泛、信心日益坚定的人民群众联合起来对资本主义进行有效斗争而争取社会主义的人的任务，这也是凡是不甘心消极等待一切事物将改变的好日子来到的人的任务。
    这就是我们争取改革结构的总的根据，也是我们在当前条件下在寻求走向社会主义的发展道路时所要达到的主要目标之一。把争取这种改革的要求同我们过去称为暂时的要求混同起来，那将是错误的；后者指的是在尖锐革命危机时刻发出的一些口号，目的只是在于引导人民群众走向夺取政权的斗争，也就是指在这一斗争过程中很快就失去效用的一些口号。结构改革是我们争取实现的一个积极目标，而这个目标是在当前的政治斗争条件下可以实现的。我们热切希望依据宪法所规定的原则实行普遍的土地改革，因为农民和全国人民立即需要这种改革，而且也因为这种改革即使在今天也已经可以实现。我们希望把工业和金融方面的最大的垄断企业国有化，这也是可以做到的。我们希望通过对价格、利润的形成、关税、不动产投机的民主统制方式，通过根本改革税收制度，来实现限制从而粉碎垄断资本的经济权力；我们希望做到这些事情，认为这些事情可以实现而且正在为促其实现而进行斗争，因为一大部分居民的切身要求的满足取决于这些事情的实现，而且要实现这些，农民才能得到土地和工作，手工业者和小生产者才能不致再受到敌视他们的巨大力量的窒息，全国人民才能从阻止他们进展的锁链中解放出来。结构改革本身并不是社会主义，但是这是为向社会前进开辟道路的经济结构改变。这是对今天工人阶级和社会主义的首要敌人的斗争措施。这些措施也是为了人民与和平的利益。
    有人提出反对意见，说我们采取这种行动，所希望的是改良资本主义，而不是消灭资本主义，还说——例如——在某些国家已经实现一些结构改革、若干国有化措施，然而并不因而向社会主义前进。第一种反对意见是站不住脚的，因为如果可以这样提，那么对只要不仅仅是增加工资的任何其他无论经济或政治要求也可以这样提。相反，第二种反对意见却提出了整个如下的斗争问题，即：在自己的党的引导下的工人阶级和人民群众在目前情况下，为了肯定自己作为在政治上和国民经济中的主导因素而必须进行的斗争。作为一个孤立的措施，国有化可能是没有多大意义的。采取某种方式的国有化，甚至可能给予某些资本家集团或者若干非进步的政治集团一些好处。但是，当国有化或针对大垄断资本的其他斗争措施是继续不断的行动和斗争的不可分的一部分，又是根据巨大的政治和群众组织的决定进行的，而且得到一大部分舆论的支持，依据现有条件来迫使实行一种有利于劳动者和中产阶级的经济政策，又依据这种政策通过议会促使政府本身采取反垄断行动——在这种情况下，事物就改观了。这样，事物就改变了。那时，即使国家对经济生活的干预也可以具有迥然不同的意义，而当政府只是充当一些垄断集团的一个工商业委员会来行动时，当国家资本主义的形式无非是国家机器从属于大资本家的意志和利益的形式时，国家干预经济生活却是另外一回事了。因此这个问题不能用一些方案来解决，这个问题的解决取决于行动，办法就是要做到组织和领导广泛的群众运动，胜利进行斗争，从而在总的经济和政治方针上强行根本改变。归根究底，要认识：今天存在着从事上述行动并且把这种行动导向胜利的条件。因此，总之问题在于阶级斗争借以进行的政治条件，在于工人阶级、农民群众和中产阶级的成熟程度，在于这些力量在社会和政治斗争中所占的地位，在于他们的觉悟程度，在于资本主义和作为资本主义化身的统治阶级的威信的普遍丧失，在于社会主义思想在人类广大群众中的威望和吸引力的日益增长。
    在意大利，把同资本主义斗争的各种社会力量结合成广泛的多样的独特的阶级联盟，反对法西斯主义的复活，具有客观基础。共产党引导工人阶级成为全国领导阶级。
    对我国来说，客观的分析使我们看出在目前环境中同资本主义斗争的各种社会力量广大阵线的一致性；这种一致性是广泛、多样、独特的阶级联盟体系的客观基础。在旧俄时代，革命前主要是作为领导力量的工人阶级同广大农民群众的联盟，随后是同这些群众各个不同部分的联盟，按照革命发展的情况而有所不同。在今天的人民中国，也有民族资产阶级的团体参加社会主义建设。在我们国内，团结在资本主义一向的敌人——工人阶级这一边的有广大农民群众，一直到包括中、小独立耕种者、广大从事生产的城市中等阶层，而且我们不排斥在某些地区有为数不少的中、小工业家参加反对垄断资本主义的斗争。这许多条件也决定建设某种社会主义社会的某些特殊的发展道路。
    对我们的手工业者、对直接耕种者广大群众、对中、小生产者的若干重要集团来说，要他们过渡到社会主义的生产形式，就是说在合作原则基础上的形式还是一件遥远的事。用恩格斯的话来说，这只能是一种自发的运动的结果，是农民们在他们那小块土地上慢慢思考的结果。在此以前，社会主义应当保证这些资本主义要破坏和摧毁的社会阶层的财产。为了进行反对垄断资本的斗争，这些社会阶层迫切地希望和需要团结起来并且趋向工人阶级这一方面，而工人阶级反对资本主义和争取社会主义的斗争可以保证他们的前途。
    我们国内的政治斗争，就其本质问题来说，就是说从争取自由、民主和社会主义的问题上说，无论从事实上看，还是从最有准备的群众的认识上看，都是由在抵抗法西斯和解放战争中获得的伟大的民族经验决定的。从这些考验中获得了一些巨大的政治成果，在意大利资本主义统治阶级里存在着一种经常的趋势，其代表是最强大的和最反动的资产阶级集团，这种趋势就是限制和破坏政治自由，首先是劳动者的民主权利；这些自由和权利被认为是有损害的陷阱和障碍。法西斯主义就是从整个一段期间这种超越一切的趋势、资本主义阵营里几乎无可否认的一种压倒一切的趋势中产生出来的。在工人阶级和它的党——共产党的领导下反对法西斯主义的抵抗和斗争开始了。工人阶级、所有具有社会主义思想的劳动群众以及他们的先进的党在解放战争中都位于前列并且在反法西斯的胜利过程中奠定了目前民主制度的历史和政治基础。
    这些伟大的历史性成果是不会磨灭的，也是不可能磨灭的。同样，人们不能够摧毁在这些方面获得的真正成果，除非人们希望在意大利社会制造这样一种迟早会重新产生法西斯主义或者是另一种形式的法西斯主义威胁的分裂。年复一年反共的疯狂仇恨和激怒叫嚣并不足以使人忘记：将近二十五年来我们的党过去和现在都是最有活力、行动始终如一的民主力量；也不足以使人忘记：是共产党在意大利现代史上从来没有遇到过的最深刻的危机中获致这种历史性荣誉：引导工人阶级、使其成为真正的全国领导阶级。长时间以来，我们善于高举起别人让它坠落于地并且予以践踏的自由和独立的旗帜。这就是我们整个政治行动和随着这个行动前进而愈来愈明显的一个永久因素。
    按照宪法所规定的民主方式进行革命斗争，瓦解特权阶级的实际权力，进行社会结构的巨大改革，走向社会主义，这是党所选择的道路。
    工人阶级和人民在这种领导下和这些条件里前进的时候所获得的最大成就是目前共和国的宪法。在我们争取获致这个宪法所进行的战斗和工作的方式里，已经有了答复工人运动目前辩论所提出的许多问题的内容（尽管这是以一种含蓄的方式表达的），因为原则问题已经解决，就是说在民主法制的范围里走向社会主义的问题已经解决。这就使得一切奸险的欺骗性指责归于破产。对于一个庄严地表达出全体人民在抵抗运动和解放战争中所肯定的原则的宪法，人们是不能用奸诈或者欺骗别人的方法来支持和拥护的。
    我们曾经希望宪法能够具有纲领的性质，希望它能够制定一个社会结构巨大改革的计划，这种改革将按照宪法本身所规定的民主方式进行，因为这正是我们为我们党、工人阶级和意大利所选择的道路。人们可以要我们注意：要主要从考虑我国情况出发（而这正是正确的）。我们进行规划时所依据的范围就在这里。今天，人们已经普遍提出可以采取民主法制形式、甚至议会形式向社会主义发展这一论点；但是这一论点所以提出，是鉴于社会主义各国体系建立之后世界结构的变化，并且考虑到殖民体系崩溃所引起的资本主义总危机的加深，最后还考虑到全世界工人运动的发展和社会主义思想的威望的增长。这种论点就是我们在1944—46年提出的那个论点。（这个论点）得以普遍提出，是十年前无法预计的巨大胜利的结果。这些胜利是在尖锐的斗争——例如，为建立中华人民共和国而进行的斗争和使得社会主义世界经历冷战而比以前更为强大的那些斗争——之后获得的。而这些情况，我们在当时都无法预计。我们的立场当时对于我们是正确的，是由于对法西斯主义获得了伟大胜利以及这个胜利所引起的全部后果，而这一切在目前仍然是有效的，不管资本主义后来是怎样复辟的。
    我不相信人们可以接受社会党龙巴迪同志在他最近的写作中和演说中所主张的那些立场。
    根据他的说法，民主的进展支配着资本主义社会在目前阶段的全部发展。从这种说法就会得出和平走向社会主义的必要性和一律性，而且在现在就非这样不可。可惜事情不是这样的，如果从这样一种概念出发，就可以直接滚到旧的机会主义之中，坠入肯定的等待主义，消极和接受资本主义奴役。不应该采用这些错误的概括。政治民主的进展确实对资本主义社会的全部发展以及对于资本主义制度趋向的某些法则如何实现都起作用。这正是马克思主义者所十分熟悉的上层建筑对于社会结构的影响的一种表现。但是政治民主的进展不改变资本主义的本质。资本主义存在多久，民主就永远受到限制而且是虚假的，因为在人们之间不存在经济平等，而劳动者没有从剥削中解放。民主进展本身（这正是关键的问题）在世界的某些地区是从特殊的经济条件中产生的，这种经济条件同列宁所研究的那种帝国主义发展是有关的，而在我们的若干邻国，民主进展则是工人阶级为维护自身利益、肯定自己是社会领导力量、使社会主义胜利而施加强大压力和进行斗争的结果。但是，在统治阶级中永远存在着这种趋势，就是要采取种种不同的办法来阻止这种过程。
    因此，我们要提防关于必然“不可扭转性”的谈论，要提防因而重新审查我们的学说根据。那些肯定国际关系缓和过程必然“不可扭转”的人，由于目前战争危机爆发而受到无情的驳斥。希望大家看看最近几十年的历史。两次伟大民主发展都是以世界大战（1914和1939）而告终的。如果没有发生十月革命，如果苏联没有成为这样强大的国家，也许在西欧就会有很多的政治民主吧？然而，在第二次世界大战以前，法西斯主义不仅统治着资本主义欧洲的绝大部分土地，而且在法西斯主义没有取得胜利的地方，资产阶级领导集团也差不多在各处都表现出要抄袭法西斯主义手段的危险摇摆的倾向。如果没有苏联的政策和苏联军队，法西斯主义就会以种种形式征服整个欧洲。
    如果中国没有在共产党人领导之下自己解放出来，就不会有殖民体系如此迅速的崩溃。是革命斗争、是经过战斗而取得的胜利，打开了向社会主义前进的民主道路。
    当然，这并不是说：某个反动集团的疯狂行动或者意图，就足以摧毁民主进步。这只是说：要进步，决定的因素是存在着一个有组织的人民—工人伟大运动，这个运动而且必须是有威望的、统一的、有着良好领导的；必须是无产阶级和人民为限制特权阶级的强权和权力而进行的斗争。这一运动不断施加压力，这一斗争取得胜利，就可以创造出像我国现在这样的独特的新条件。工人阶级还没有夺得国家政治领导权，但是，工人阶级支配了在我国赖以复兴的那次人民运动，然后这个国家才得以拥有一个宣布政权“以劳工为基础”的宪法，宪法又肯定必须进行为革新我国社会、为促使走向社会主义所需的政治经济变革。
    这些就是像我国这样发展的阶级斗争所获得的独特成就。因此，尊重和实施宪法就成了社会主义革新力量和反动保守势力角逐的场所。不能够把宪法中狭义的政治条款和它的社会经济内容割裂开来。而我国现有的民主，从内容上说，仍然是有限的而且虚假的，同时还受到统治者自己的不断威胁。然而，宪法谴责了对于民主权利予以专制限制的做法，又规定必须铲除造成公民之间不平等的物质障碍，同时大致指出为了铲除这些障碍而必须完成的改革。这样，宪法本身就为逐步改革开辟了道路，从而得以日益深入地瓦解特权阶级的实际权力，并且使得民主本身具有日益广泛而有效的内容。统治阶级和它的政党对于这种进步的抗拒是如何顽强，我们是知道的；而且我们并不排除他们发动反动政变的可能性。但是，当我们考虑这种可能性的时候，我们从中得出的结论是：我们必须更加坚决地掌握起民主进步、保卫自由的旗帜，不仅维护我们的利益，而且维护一切人民阶层和意大利全社会的利益。反动政变虽有可能，但是我们不能够因而得出结论说：必须改变我们党的性质和它的革命的战略。相反，我们坚持这个方向。
    我们的革命思想同社会民主党所固有的改良主义，有根本的分歧。确立民主发展的前景，并不摒弃斗争。目前的历史任务是通过新的联盟和合作，由工人阶级从政治上领导建设社会主义。
    在制度这一具体问题上，同保守势力的斗争已经特别尖锐。左翼自由党人歪曲事实真相，从而在我们看来，他们从本质上说就跟民主的敌人一样；但愿他们放弃这种歪曲，假如我们没有对欺骗性法律进行胜利斗争，假如社会党人也没有进行斗争（指1953年对新选举法进行的斗争，那种选举法企图使得天主教民主党获得绝对多数——译注），那么，议会制度今天就会早已处于不死不活的状态。欺骗性法律是走向取消议会制度的第一步。至于我们，假如我们不认为议会体制具有重大的价值，假如我们把议会只当作进行反对现政权和反对资本主义制度的鼓动的讲坛，我们就不会那样坚持地进行这种斗争。但是，6月7日的胜利只是向我们保证了一个先决条件来促使议会有效地参与革新社会的伟大工作。照议会现在这样的工作方式，它并没有履行这种职责，必须向整个民主舆论和全国严重地提出这个问题。
    我们对于自由问题、民主问题、议会问题和社会主义问题的提法，一向随着阶级力量对比的发展情况，随着工人阶级和工人阶级所能够领导的人民力量的斗争情况，随着反对资本主义统治阶级的斗争进展情况而变化。我们的革命思想和社会民主党所固有的改良主义思想之间最根本的分歧点就在这里。
    社会主义客观条件是在资本主义社会内部成熟的，这是一个科学的正确的论断。改良主义却从这种论断中演绎出这种说法：只需等待从资本主义内部依靠奇迹来孵化出社会主义就行了。由此产生了一种倾向，就是认为资本主义发展本身就已经是走向社会主义的过程。社会民主党领袖们就从这种看法中推演出这种理论：他们的任务就是好好管理资本主义和资本主义社会，既然这样也将达到社会主义。既然自甘这样，为了理应管理资本主义，他们就发动了苏伊士战争，就在世界上燃起了战火。对于他们说来，民主已经不是一种已经夺得的应以群众民主斗争来予以拱卫并不断予以扩大的阵地，而是空话，而是相反的东西，就像我们这里的萨拉盖特和谢尔巴之间的勾结所表现的那样。破坏宪法，践踏宪法，对劳动者施加国家武力，这不是保卫民主，而是用暴力来阻止民主的确立和发展。
    我们是民主的，因为我们是在宪法、民主习惯以及宪法确定的法制的范围内行动的；我们要求所有的人尊重这种法制，所有的人都执行宪法的一切规定，首先是统治者执行这些规定。我们已经取得了民主的地盘，以便由此向着社会主义迈进。因此，我们甚至要保卫这个地盘。而且还不止此，社会主义革新的迫切性，这种革新符合极大多数人民利益的事实，人们对这一点的觉悟的日益增长，这种觉悟日益表现为团结的群众越来越浩大的、享有越来越大的威信的运动——所有这一切都使我们看出，民主的和宪法的生活准则，对于在使工人群众本身和国家遭受尽可能少的决裂和蒙受尽可能少的牺牲的情况下逐步进行的社会主义建设来说，并不是一种阻碍，而是一种帮助。如果说列宁在1917年十月革命之前几个月就不排除社会主义革命的和平发展和几个政党永久共存的可能性，那末我们今天在这个已被社会主义深刻革新的世界里就更有权利认为实现这种可能性是我们的根本任务了。
    因此，我们在提交代表大会的一个文件中写道：“对工人阶级和对意大利人民来说，目前的历史任务在于通过新的联盟和新的合作来实现必要的工人阶级领导，尊重民主方法，用走向解放和完全翻身的全体劳动人民的力量，打破自由和社会进步的敌人的抗拒和阴谋，从而通过同其他国家中实现无产阶级专政的方式迥然不同的新道路来进行社会主义建设。”
    这种说法丝毫没有修改我们的原则。无产阶级专政，就是说由工人阶级从政治上领导建设社会主义社会，是一种历史的必要。但是，列宁在肯定说所有国家不可避免地将走向社会主义以后又说：“所有的国家并不是用同样的方式走向社会主义的。每一个国家在民主形式方面，正如在无产阶级专政形式的多样性方面、在它用社会主义方式重新组织社会生活的快慢方面一样，都有它自己的特点。”
    确立民主发展的前景，并不是说抛弃顽强的斗争。以局势决定的形式来进行斗争是必要的；而领导这个斗争的应该是由工人阶级革命先锋队领导的工人阶级；就在斗争的过程中，走向社会主义的进步阵线应该在前进中日益扩大来包括新的社会集团，而且应该从而在工人阶级和全体人民中培养出越来越高的社会主义觉悟。假如没有这一切，那就有仅仅是说空话的危险。假如不了解我们所要求的土地改革和结构改革、对垄断资本进行民主监督、扩大民主、有效地利用议会以及我们国民生活的全部革新，都是为了使工人、农民、中等阶级和全国人民有新的生活条件、为了消除穷困和社会上的不公平、为了保证每个人都有工作和都能过有保障的值得过活的幸福生活，那便有脱离不了用多少有点道理的口号来进行泛泛的鼓动的危险。千百万男女焦虑地面临着的这些迫切问题，终究应该是出发点。
    意大利工人阶级已经起了政治领导的作用，它能领导一切劳动力量和进步力量来改革政治经济和文化，完成历史任务。
    我的意思是说，假如工人阶级的思想、组织、权利、要求和斗争、它给予其他社会集团的要求和经济政治斗争的支持以及给予争取自由、争取工作与和平的斗争的支持，不能成为这个运动中最活跃的因素，那末整个运动便会缺乏政治和社会的方向，缺乏社会主义的领导。
    意大利工人阶级的人数没有西欧其他国家的人数多。意大利工人阶级并不是在全国领土上以同一的方式发展的。首都的工人阶级很薄弱，南部的某些地区中几乎没有工人阶级。尽管如此，我们工人阶级已经对我们的整个历史作出了决定性的贡献。它已经在半个世纪不到的时期中在它的公民意识和政治觉悟方面取得了巨大的进步。我们党就是这种进步的最英勇的最高表现。
    1900年，当意大利社会正在发生民主转变的时候，安东尼奥·拉布里奥拉在一封给巴斯加勒·维拉里的信中——我想这封信还没有发表过——对社会主义斗争的前景表示了十分保留和谨慎的态度。他说：“我从来没有设想，意大利的社会主义对于推翻资本主义世界能起杠杆作用。在文明世界中，任何人都不相信这点，其他国家的社会党人也不相信这点。我一向认为，意大利的社会主义是这样的一个工具：1、发挥群众的政治认识；2、教育那一部分可以教育的工人建立阶级组织；3、以一个强大的群众组织来反对那些叫做政党的各种集团；4、迫使政府的代表们进行一些有益于全体人民的经济改革。严格地说，其他的社会主义宣传，只能在遥远的将来才能对意大利的后代产生实际的效果。”（1900年11月13日致巴斯加勒·维拉里函）
    这些后代已经出现了，他们在经验、斗争和极大的牺牲中获得了锻炼。在写这封信之后二十二年，有人明确地提出了当时主要的迫切任务——以安东尼奥·葛兰西为首的都灵无产阶级提出了一个唯一的政治方案。这个方案在第一次世界大战后，本可以使工人阶级成为新的领导阶级，从而把意大利从法西斯灾难中挽救出来。那些忽视历史条件和历史事实而在当时人为地搬用只能适合于目前情况的结论的人们是毫无道理的。这样做，他们就忘记了当时不可能用革命方式夺取政权，因为没有一支可以领导另一种斗争的力量。面对这一考验，改良主义以及空谈的、缺乏一贯性的最高纲领主义表现出它们的无能，并且破产了。经验证明，如果要走民主道路，必须有革命的领导。这就是安东尼奥·葛兰西根据列宁的指示希望工人阶级得到的领导。我们已经提供了这种领导。正因如此，他当时已能看到工人阶级的任务是把意大利从灾难中拯救出来，我们的努力也就是要使这一预言得以实现。
    这样，工人阶级已经起了一种政治领导的作用，今天它可以有正当的权利提出领导整个意大利社会的要求。它完成了拉布里奥拉所提到的教育任务，它不再是孤立的，它不仅仅是在原则上反对资本主义世界，而且有符合于全国人民利益的建设国家社会的纲领。它已沿着这个纲领所指出的道路前进。它能领导一切劳动力量和进步力量来改革经济、政治组织和文化，充分地完成历史交给它的任务。
    最反动的力量正在掀起新的反共浪潮，企图把政治局势推向右转。天主教政党正在追求新型的极权主义。但反共宣传绝对遮盖不了自由的进展。
    我们应该以我们一贯的诚恳态度承认，并且指出，在我们所规定的道路上，我们估计是会遇到一段困难时期的。由于目前国际上深刻的危机的影响，一般的经济情况，特别是人民的生活条件将会显著地恶化。冬季的情况将是很艰苦的，我们迫切的问题是要组织和动员劳动群众来保卫他们的生存。在我国政治生活中，由于最反动的力量的推动和领导，一个新的、粗暴的反共浪潮已被掀起来了。指导这一运动的人们并不是热爱自由或关切匈牙利人民的命运。他们对塞得港的屠杀无动于衷。对于遭受苦难的危地马拉、塞浦路斯、阿尔及利亚和西班牙人民，他们从来没有表示任何关怀。他们所感兴趣的是反对我们，因为我们是站在我国民主改革和社会改革的伟大事业的前列并且号召意大利全国人民来进行这种改革的。他们企图卑鄙地利用目前在部分公众舆论中所存在的情绪和混乱，把整个的政治局势推向右转，使局势趋向于违反群众利益和民族利益。他们要求恢复极端的“大西洋主义”，严重地侵犯和破坏宪法；他们希望在国内和国外恢复冷战；他们梦想新的冲突、新的不能克服的倾轧，并对工人运动进行新的挑衅；他们甚至疯狂地要求把工人阶级和人民的先进力量置于非法地位，而这些先进力量对于共和国的建立曾经作出极大的贡献。
    这一显然反动的方向与最近举行的天主教民主党特伦多代表大会所规定的方向没有什么不同之处。大家一致认为，这次会议同我们所批评过的上次那不勒斯会议比较起来，是一种倒退，既然那不勒斯会议至少在表面上还表现了某些民主和改良的愿望。
    在天主教民主党特伦多代表大会上，所有不可少的和急迫的经济和社会改革问题都不见了，会上只看见天主教民主党目前领导机构企图以人们所熟悉的一切手段来加强它的政治垄断并使之不可动摇。同这个意图相称的是在已经存在了两年的这个政府里，任何政治上的倡议都停滞不前。对于像失业问题、工人自由、土地合同、限制垄断事业的权限、扩大地区组织、取消严重违反宪法的措施这样迫切的问题都完全没有着手解决和作出决定。有过一个总统谘文（在共和国总统就职时的谘文——译注），其中曾经宣布革新统治阶级的转折点既将到来并且宣布将彻底执行宪法；我们遗憾地看到这声音只是在沙漠中的喊叫而已。
    目前反动十字军运动完全合乎天主教民主党特伦多代表大会的路线，它是这条路线的实行和发展。这个行动的目的是要树起一道他们幻想为不可超越的障碍物，来使得共和国总统所宣布的转折点在长时期内无从实现。
    这样，天主教运动的内部矛盾就再一次地暴露出来了。这个运动本身在客观上具有进步的因素，因为它标志着劳动群众开始参加政治生活和他们的觉醒，有时它表现出反对资本主义的倾向。这种倾向是劳动群众为了保卫他们的经济利益和要求改善生活的愿望而自发地表现的，但是来自社会上层的保守意图反对这种倾向；对这些社会上层人士来说，反对资本主义的要求，不过是阻止全体劳动人民获得社会主义觉悟和团结在工人阶级革命领导者周围的一个工具。
    今天，天主教政党正在起着特殊的变化，它已成为——如同过去法西斯主义的情况一样——资本主义统治阶级中大多数人所瞩望的政党。在党内，永远保持政治垄断的诱惑增长了。换句话说，就是一种新型的极权主义。天主教教会幻想这种极权主义对它的自由行事是最好的保证，而天主教统一运动就是自由行事的理论基础。
    教会领导人士一心打算以一种新的形式，或甚至玩弄选举花样，来获得他们过去本来想依靠欺骗性选举法案所达到的结果。假如这些领导人士实现了他们的计划，教会的控制将是不能容忍的；国家组织的生活将比今天更加受到歪曲。
    在这种情况下，人们可以看到世俗权力将屈从于教会当局，思想和文化胜利的主要成果将受到威胁。
    资本主义领导阶级在这些威胁前面是无动于衷的，因此长久以来他们在这方面已不复起进步的作用。目前他们所关心的唯一的事是维持他们的特权和反对社会主义以保全自己。但是近代文明的成就，反对教权主义和反对愚民政策，特别是脱离了教权的政治独立，国家的世俗化以及对各种意识形态的容忍，都是人民和文化胜利的成果，都是必须加以保卫的。教会的进攻是在反共的旗帜下进行的，这在我们看来似乎只能起相反的作用，并且反而使得我们感到光荣。
    这就是一个证明，证明我们正在完成文明的和历史的任务。工人阶级为民主和社会主义进行斗争，这样做，工人阶级也就保全了前此获得的进步成果。正是我们在延续文明的一切优良传统。让我们向中间民主党派的领导人发出一个严重的警告，因为他们目前无保留地纷纷参加反共十字军的行列，至少他们有些人甚至竭力争取充当反共十字军领袖！
    他们这样做，并不是为民主事业服务，而他们所领导的集团也不能从中得到任何好处。而只会引起混乱，正如我在过去曾几次指出的。脱离了工人阶级的基本力量，就是脱离了我们的力量，并且和它战斗，这样，中间民主力量就得不到我们在解放斗争时期所给予的那种支持，因而必然会被人蚕食、损害以至被人轻侮，最后就会被教权派粉碎。
    在匈牙利问题上，我们不想把我们的意见强加于任何人，虽然这个意见是平稳的和慎重的。教会人士的反共十字军的目的显然是要强使所有的人接受对民主秩序进行新的破坏和抛弃一切社会进步。如果不依靠革命的无产阶级，民主以及民主的发展就不可能存在。
    有些文化界人士和我们原来就有积极的合作，他们今天却宣称：任何场所只要有我们在场，他们就不能进去。这话我们听听而已，并不感到过分的奇怪；我们并不打算重提起关于在其他的场合由于容忍而得到的教训。
    我们的葛兰西曾经告诉我们：使文化界人士成为统治阶级工具的绳索是如何的坚固；这些绳索构成一个虽然稀薄但是坚实的网，用这个网就可以把人民群众和中等阶层控制在资本主义霸权之下。就是这些在同我们讨论的时候否认政治与文化之间的关系的人们，提供了证据来说明政治霸权的强暴的优势，而这个政治却是为最反动的集团所支配的。
    反共宣传绝对遮盖不了自由的进展。它永远是而且只能是一面反动的旗帜、一个阻碍一切民主进步的羁绊、一个后退的工具。我们所有不愿做社会保守势力和反动势力的奴才的人们，必须提防无论以什么形式出现的反共宣传。
    有一种特殊形式的反共宣传，它有时在知识分子的团体中间酝酿成熟，而这正是我们所要揭发的；我想把它称为家长式的反共宣传，因为它采取了这样的面貌：他们几乎是以保护者和指导者的态度对待我们，这样来朝着我们的错误和弱点进攻；但是当他们叙述这些错误和缺点时的态度，就只是惯常的诬蔑，不过稍稍加上一点虚伪而已。而到了最后，就是对马克思主义进攻，确切地说，是向马克思主义者进攻，把后者说成总是落后的，现在应该回到学校里去，并不是到斗争的现实和斗争实践的学校里去——这些新的指导者一般说来是没有切身体验过斗争的——而是到一种新类型的凭冲动提出批评的学校里去，他们从没有发表一些有建设性或者站得住的话。他们不去研究和了解我们整个政策的理性内容，却向我们发表关于“国家指导”的长篇演说，他们甚至看不到他们正是在重复杰达·谢尔巴的口号，甚至更坏，因而和他们同流合污。
    我们不拒绝，我们欢迎并接受任何关于展开客观的友好的争论的邀请。我们准备向所有拥有一点东西可以教导我们的人们学习，我们不拒绝任何教益。我们从科学家和文化界人士那里学到了很多东西，他们用自己的自主研究帮助我们深入了解我们国家的历史问题、文化潮流以及我们学说的精华。但对于这种回到反共十字军道路上去的家长主义，我们看不出它能对什么事和对什么人有用。不幸，类似的批评，在匈牙利已经使人忘掉我们的事业和工人阶级敌人的事业之间的分界线。
    我们将继续同天主教工人群众谋求谅解和合作，争取同天主教力量结成政治联盟。目前正在力求解决政治经济上的重大问题，来打破政治僵局。
    我们并不改变我们对于天主教工人群众的立场，我们和他们将继续谋求各种不同方式的接触以及谅解和合作。目前反共宣传的浪潮在竭力制止这种接触；这种接触在最近的几次斗争中，像在今年夏天意大利南方农业工人的斗争中，曾经使得地主和反动势力非常担忧。我们作为一个政党对于匈牙利事件采取明确立场，同农业工人或铁路工人或退休工人的神圣不可侵犯的要求两者之间存在着什么关系，这是谁也说不上的。不过我们很了解为了争取实现这些要求而团结所遭到的阻碍，树立起来这种阻碍为的是阻止实现团结。我们就是为团结而努力的，从而使得天主教工人们了解这种必要性并使他们起来要求消除在争取改善生活行动中实现团结的一切障碍。
    我们应该用在天主教群众中传播社会主义思想基本内容的真理的办法，发挥更多的创造性和最大的勇气，使我们互相接近以便于进行当前的斗争。这样做不应该成为我们的一个障碍，而应该有利于我们这方面的行动。今日为教会组织所控制的劳动群众，不应该被看作——因为这将是一个严重错误——一个不能进入的严密的集团。如果工人运动的创始人当时这样想，社会主义政党就永远不会在意大利产生。
    今天，人们看到这些先锋队员向旧日社会偏见、反动思想和政治保守的壁垒冲锋的锐气，已经消失了一部分。而古怪的是这一部分锐气的消失，恰恰是在社会主义思想有了那么重大的进展的时候，以至于在天主教行动派的集会中，教授们、神甫们和修士们都不得不动员起来，采取过火而且无效的保留，来反对群众中间传播日广的这一信念：如果要让每一个人都有不算枉活一场的生活，那就必须结束资本主义制度。
    思想意识方面的把戏，各式各种挑衅和离间的宣传固然可以阻挠一下这种发展，但是决不能使这种发展停止。在寻找一条走向社会主义的意大利道路时，必须考虑同天主教力量结成政治联盟，从反对资本主义的思想出发，以至决定采取必要的办法来使意大利资本主义体制受到必要的深刻改造。
    教会和社会民主党目前的领导人物疯狂地对我们进行斗争，从而助长了城乡特权阶层的气焰，正在这时，我们党不仅向全国提出了一个彻底革新的总纲领，而且还集中注意几个根本的和紧急的问题，以便打开目前的政治僵局，并解决几个对我国政治和经济上的进步有决定意义的问题。这几个问题就是：（1）工人阶级对自由的要求，以及对付失业问题的必要措施；（2）普遍土地改革的开始；（3）工业结构几种初步改革的实施，包括电力这一给人压力最大的、最具灾害性的垄断事业的收归国有；（4）在全意大利建立普遍的组织；（5）在各种救济方式以及提高各种养老金的水平方面，建立一种普遍的社会保险制度。
    我们应该把工人阶级的要求作为中心，并放在最前面。
    意大利工人阶级正在遭受着资本家残酷的压力和打击。维护工人阶级权利的斗争，是一切民主分子的最起码的责任。
    今天工人阶级正遭受着资本家残酷的压力和打击。资本家企图分化工人阶级，使它疲乏，让它离开自己最活跃的领导人，使它意识不到自己的革命力量。工人阶级已经促成一个巨大的统一工会运动；它有力地进行了必不可少的政治活动来保卫民主自由权利；它并且胜利地保卫了，甚至在某些部门局部地提高了在业工人的收入。但是总的来说，如果研究一下就业工人的数字、劳动生产率和劳动强度，在另一方面，如果研究一下资方利润的涨落线和工资的涨落线，人们就会发现在全国劳动收入总额里面工人应得的一部分，显然是在逆转。证明这种情况的数字，已经由工会领导机构予以广泛传播。我想附带指出：那怕是工资最高的部门，现在也还缺乏认真的研究：劳动强度对于工人的健康、工人的寿命，究竟有些什么影响。工人阶级是以全力为争取民主而斗争的一个阶级；谁也不能说，它的物质生活已经获得适当的改善。因此，工人组织为了改善工资待遇而进行斗争是完全正当的，而且是争取关于维护劳动者经济的任何活动的支柱。
    那末，工人阶级现在处境的根源何在呢？我可以指出两个原因。第一，工会的两次分裂，使工人争取满足生活要求的斗争很不容易进行，有些地方甚至使这种斗争陷于停顿，或是永远只能取得一些稀少的和有限的成就。第二，资本家，尤其是在最大的企业里，对工人阶级进攻，企图把工人阶级置于不断遭受压力的制度之下，企图剥夺工人的基本权利，使他们向资本家及其代理人的横暴行为屈服，迫害并斥逐工人中最有觉悟的分子，剥夺厂内委员会的一切威信并加以分化，恢复同公开反动统治时期相仿的情况。
    工人对这种进攻进行了反击；许多全国性的和地方性的活动是正确的，并且值得举出；但是我们应该承认，没有进行继续不断、配合得很好的行动，来善为利用目前民主政体提供的一切可能性——从经济性和政治性的罢工，一直到议会活动——而今天大家已经看到这一事实的后果是些什么。一些最大的工业中心发动统一行动从而促成的工人生活议会调查委员会，至今都没有得到应有的运用。问题不在于写上成本成本的书，送到议会的地窖里去霉烂。以已经做的工作为基础，现在已经急需从正面去考虑和解决几个尖锐的问题；这些问题必须用立法措施、或是用行政措施来加以解决，越快越好。
    我相信工会和我们党一定会在这方面立即拟定出必要的建议，并且在工厂中进行强有力的鼓动，从而从资本家和政府那里重新争取到对于工人运动力量本身至为重要的、构成民主制度的这些权利：
    履行劳动合同，厂内委员会享有权利和这些权利获得尊重，争取制定确认解雇必须有充分理由的原则的新雇佣法，禁止由于意见的不同而骚扰、歧视工人或对工人施行报复，禁止建立警察式监视机构，资方如在厂内破坏宪法保障全体公民享有的权利和尊严、则予以有效制裁。
    维护工厂中工人阶级权利的斗争，是一切民主分子的最起码的责任。任何争取扩大和加强民主的行动绝对必须以这种斗争为自己的一个组成部分。我们号召全党、属于任何倾向的工会、全体工人、一切善良的意大利民主分子参加这一斗争。
    只有用劳动者的阶级斗争来推动，技术进步才能转化为社会进步，而这是意大利共产党人努力的目标。
    最近，广泛讨论了工人阶级及其组织对于技术进步应该采取什么态度，我们代表大会在筹备过程中也讨论了这个问题。已经发现：最近意大利的生产技术有了进步，同这个进步相适应的是生产力向某些方向有了发展。开始在初步采用自动化装备。这种发现是令人感兴趣的，我们应该收集这种发现，而且应该善于不断正确地估计正在发生的变化的意义和正在实现的进步的意义。有一种意见是同马克思主义毫不相干的，这种意见认为：在资本主义总危机时期，技术上和经济上不再能有进步，不再能够前进，生产力不再能够发展；我相信，无需花很多时间来驳斥这种意见。
    马克思主义只是说：只要资本主义还存在，尤其是在今天，这种发展就是同对立、对抗、同往往比以往更严重的新矛盾相联系的；马克思主义要求我们集中注意于这一点，如果我们不想铸成重大错误。在工人运动初期有过一种意见，这种意见认为：工人应该仇视技术进步，因为它使得劳动条件更加恶化；我也认为没有必要花很多时间来驳斥这种意见。
   工人是赞成技术进步的；他们把技术进步看作减轻疲劳的办法，他们自己要求改进技术，他们是技术的朋友，既然技术指引他们进行这种改进。对于这一点是不能有丝毫怀疑的。对于正在实现的技术进步没有及时给予必要的注意，没有正确估计其意义，这是当时的一个错误。我们已经认真地着手纠正这一错误。
    但是，在这方面，对于我们说来，最重要的事情是什么呢？最重要的是不要仅仅承认技术进步，而要善于从这种认识出发来在工厂中、在每个劳动部门和在全国进行工人阶级要求满足切身利益的斗争。
    在我们说来，学习应该永远是行动的准备。我们工人运动中所犯过的错误，就是在指导工人斗争的时候未能及时采取工厂中已经产生的变化所需要的新方式，而这些变化却造成了新型的工资关系和管理关系。
    现在，必须迅速适应新形势。然而，对于工人领袖说来，最严重的错误，就是不善于组织和发展行动，来维护收入，争取增加收入，阻止加紧剥削，减轻这种剥削，在技术改进的同时改善劳动者的境遇本身。工人促进技术进步的最有效方式，不是消极地接受人们要给予他的一切，而是在一切情况下发展他的争取满足切身要求的阶级斗争。这就是整个社会所需要的推动力量，假如整个社会要想真正进步——不是在大垄断集团的利润数字中，而是在居民生活水平中表现这种进步。只有用劳动者的阶级斗争来推动，技术进步才能转化为社会进步，而这应该是我们努力的目标。
    认为人们可以克服资本主义的矛盾，人们可以创造一个内部没有矛盾的乌托邦的资本主义政权，人们可以消灭阶级斗争，人们可以单纯借助技术的进步——你要说是舒舒服服的技术进步也可以——从工厂神甫祝福的家长式制度里获致一个全球的天堂，这些说法都是改良主义的谎言和修正主义的幻想。这种学说正中老板们、教会人士和反动的社会民主党人的心意，意大利工人早就看透了这些说法意味着什么。这些说法意味着这样一种情况：人们试图消灭不管属于哪一种倾向的工会，试图摧毁工厂组织，试图把工人们的手足束缚起来，交给决定他们劳动条件、工资和生活条件的老板。
    无论是社会民主党人所主张的，或者是天主教统一运动所主张的大同小异的东西，这种一方面浸透了家长制，另一方面浸透了资本家暴行的改良主义不能提供其他的远景，而只是维持大垄断资本的统治、逐渐窒息中等阶层、中止意大利所需要的社会革新。我们不应忘记的是存在着整个国民经济技术发展的总的问题，我们太少接触这个问题了。要成为一个技术发达的国家首先要消灭失业的现象，并且使一切劳动力，包括妇女的劳动力在内，都能够有用。有人说万诺尼的“计划”就是按照这个目标拟定的。可是人们今天还不知道这个“计划”变成了什么样子。谢尔巴曾说他已经实现了这个“计划”，贝拉却要放弃它。塞尼想要保全一些碎屑，一些渣滓。
    赞成重建单一的民主的大工会组织。中心问题是发动群众运动，争取实现经济要求，展开保卫自由与和平的斗争。
    统一工会运动对这个建议并不是仅仅表示纯粹否定的态度的，而是在争取满足生活要求的活动以外，还肯定自己决心争取并确立一项良好的政府政策，这是做得很出色的。
    但是必须弄明白，在号召多生产和少消费的同时，用公开或暗中冻结工资的方法，是不能消除失业现象，是不能保证社会进步的。恰恰相反，应当从提高生活水平出发，进而扩大国内市场、进行土地改革、使南部和像罗马这样一些大城市工业化等等。但是除非采取有效的措施来限制垄断资本的经济权力以及进行必不可少的制度改革，就不能获得这些结果。我们建议从电力垄断企业国有化开始，这样便可以用动力价格的新政策来打破一些阻碍所谓“落后”地区经济发展的锁链。
    关于失业方面，我们的建议是立即研究普遍减少劳动时间的问题——即使还不是一切场合都削减——把每周的劳动时间削减到四十小时，但工资不减少。经验证明，由于目前技术的进步，这种改革是可能的；不过只有在政府过问的情况下才可能实现。这样，大批的失业群众就可以迅速获得职业。这些是前进的第一步。
    普遍推行劳动自动化或许是即将到来的远景。如果推行，就会造成相反的结果：由于不断解雇，失业情况更加混乱和沸腾的危险就会成为事实。
    我现在不愿意进一步深入研究这一课题，但是我认为人们应当获得的结论是国家在经济部门进行干与，以便防止这种可能造成灾难的后果。
    这个问题应当由工会来认真地加以考虑，就像别的一些国家所做的那样。我们对这一事实感到欣慰：农民群众争取从普遍限制土地所有权入手、实现让耕者有其田的全面土改的斗争运动，无论在南方或是北方都活跃地展开了。根据目前土地制度和农业经营不同的形式，为这些斗争明确定出发展路线，将是这次代表大会的任务之一。这些斗争应当扩大到所有的地区。维护永久正当利益原则、反对取消这一原则的主张——这种主张是天主教民主党和社会民主党所支持的——的斗争将有力地在议会里进行；但是要获得成功就必须获得农民群众运动的支持，这个运动应该超过迄至目前所达到的范围，应该具有这样的一个特点，就是团结所有的佃农和实物佃农，不问他们具有何种见解、何种政治倾向，使他们都参加这个运动。
    在政治方面，我们争取自由，反对违反宪法、反对歧视制度、反对成为教会专权特色的官僚主义中央集权和贪污腐化的斗争，今天应当集中力量要求切实改革政治结构。在取消省长制和扩大地方行政自治的同时，普遍推行区域自治是当前的主要改革之一。
    下述情况是完全令人不能容忍的：一位部长在答复我们的建议时居然敢说不能进行改革，因为改革有损于占统治地位的党。宪法没有保证这种结构改革，但是宪法明文规定要进行结构改革。一位部长竟敢不顾宪法的明文就这样讲，是应该归案法办的。不能排除这种可能性：我们会在议会中依据宪法法院的判决提出一些部长的责任问题——甚至是刑事责任问题，因为他们在若干年中蓄意违反宪法而制订了一些奇特的法律。
    足以强行实现这样一种民主纲领——即使是有限度的纲领——的力量，今天是不是存在呢？我要重复一遍，可以预计会有一个艰巨的斗争时期。领导人和现在执政的各党，即使在最好的情况下，大多数力求延续目前的停滞不前状态。天主教民主党人士采取这种立场，是为了进一步加紧他们的政治垄断；右派各党人士采取这种立场，目的在于朝着更加反动的方向推进。臭名远扬的工农业大资本三边联盟力求不受监督地统治全国。在某些新因素出现之前，从最上层接触和协议出发来采取有效行动的可能性是相当有限的。把“向左开展”几乎设想为在最上层实现的一种活动的结果，这种想法至少在我们看来曾经特别是社会党同志的错误，但是部分地也曾经是我们的错误之一。最上层的接触是既有可能也会有成果的，但是取决于争取舆论支持一项明确纲领的斗争获得成功，也取决于工人阶级和人民先进部分进行有效的斗争来促使实现重大的经济与政治
  要求，来促使实现最深刻的必要改革。如果要摆脱停滞不前状
  态、击退反动势力的新威胁，如果要粉碎天主教民主党的垄断，从而创造新的政治形势，今天仍然必须极其充分地实现上述各点。
    因此，我们也要驳斥充满悲观情绪或盼望奇迹的想法。前者认为意大利民主的新的进步发展的可能性已经消失；而后者则认为政治力量的联盟——例如社会党和社会民主党的统一，不管统一是怎样准备、怎样实现的——就足以扭转局势。我们同样要反对某些人的立场：他们考虑到在反动资产阶级顽固抗拒和袭击的情况下整个工会运动现在面临着困难，因而认为：解决工会统一问题是一个必需条件，非此就不能再采取行动争取实现生活要求和维护工人的权利。
    我们认为一切的中心是：群众运动；工人阶级、农民、生产者中等阶层、大多数人民争取实现经济要求、保卫自由与和平的斗争。劳动者的团结，对于组织这个运动和这些斗争，对于促其胜利，是最为有效的工具。就因为此，必须争取、保卫和发展劳动者的团结，决不让它遭受破坏。
    因此，我们无保留地赞成重建一个单一的民主的大工会组织，这个组织将接纳意大利的一切劳工力量来反对资本家，不受党派和政府的任何牵制，超脱意识形态和政治立场的一切分歧，同时排除不论何种性质的一切歧视。我们支持我们的工会领导同志所采取的主张恢复这样一个伟大单一组织的立场。统一的恢复应当不偏袒我们的组织，也不应当偏袒任何其他工会派别或政治派别。统一的恢复应当能促使工人阶级获得新的伟大成就，像过去实现按物价调整工资的成就一样。统一的恢复应当能使工人提高觉悟而对自己的力量以及对在民主和进步方面应有的职责有新的认识。
    意共和社会党应保持团结合作。赞成社会党的重新统一。社会民主党应该抛弃它的分裂的和反共的立场。
    至于政治方面，在苏共第二十次代表大会之后，我们是从认识到新条件存在出发的，这些新条件不仅要求、而且使得有可能在工人阶级和依据社会主义原则的一切有组织力量的团结方面取得新的进展。这些条件仍然十分现实地存在着，尽管社会民主党领袖发动了目前的反动攻势，他们力图掩盖事实，进行破坏，从而使分裂永远继续下去。在意大利的社会党恢复统一的趋势就证明了上述条件是始终存在的。
    在我们的国家里，存在着两个工人阶级的、奉行社会主义原则的政党：我们党和意大利社会党。这两个党：十多年来已经做到互相了解、和睦相处和密切合作。这种成就已经深入企业劳动者和农村劳动者的思想，而且是十分深入他们的思想的，因为这个经验曾经决定性地有助于工人阶级和人民在斗争中取得胜利。在各阶段的合作形式是不同的。合作形式不能不随着环境而变化。把这两党的一致行动简单称之为“阵线主义”，因此是错误的。像1948年那样组织一个选举阵线，只是合作形式中的一种。但是，在社会党在我们的兄弟友爱的帮助之下渡过了社会民主派分裂所酿成的，连续几次选举结果所造成的危机之后，什么“阵线主义”都立刻没有了，存在的只是合作。这种合作不仅容许、而且要求充分的相互的自主，既然我们的立场和社会党的立场在许多问题上有所分歧。对于这种分歧，我们从来不恶意对待。既然我们在根本目标上，在民主斗争的方式上是一致的，我们就在决定性的政治运动和阶级运动中，甚至不用书面协定也实现了团结合作。
    这种情况应该保持下去，因为我们相信在像我们党和社会党这样的两个党之间应该保持兄弟友爱的关系，继续在只要有此需要的时候就互相接触，在两党所参加的群众组织中保持合作，在反对共同的敌人——他们是工人阶级的敌人、民主和社会主义的敌人——的斗争中保持团结。这一切并不排斥各自自主和友爱地互相批评，相反，以此作为条件。
    社会民主党也是从以往的社会主义运动这个主干上衍生的；但是，自从它建立以后，它就一向敌视阶级力量的团结，自甘投入保卫资本主义、维护大西洋专制、进行反民主歧视、反共挑衅以及思想和政治纷争的阵线。欧洲的各社会民主主义政党以意大利社会民主党为最恶劣。我相信社会党同志是不能不同意这一评断的。由此，不能不得出这种结论：社会民主派所造成的分裂既已渡过，就应该肯定不移地抛弃社会民主党从分裂时起到今天所一贯采取的政治立场——社会民主党的这些立场甚至达到这种地步：同实行资本主义复辟的、对劳动者进行屠杀的政府结成一伙，制定欺骗性法律，参加谢尔巴政府，反对选举现任的共和国总统。尤其应该同时抛弃成为任何分裂行动的借口的、卑鄙的出于成见的反共宣传。
    今天我们看不见有利于建立一个以社会主义思想为指导的意大利工人单一政党的条件。但是，我们并不认为不能创造这种条件。我们将努力使这种条件得以创造出来，而假如将来这种条件存在，我们将不反对这种更广泛的团结。
    但是，假如今天竟然继续保持社会民主党立场，让它在恢复了统一的新社会党中占据优势而且成为指导思想，那么，从对资本主义进行更为有效的斗争的角度来看，以及对于社会主义说来，这种统一行动就会具有否定的意义。那样，将不再成其为促成团结的行动。竟然有人把毁灭这种已有的、已经争取得到的团结称为统一。工人运动将身受其害，它将在一定的时间内陷于混乱。而反动势力将从中渔利。因此，我们从最初起就已经宣告：我们赞成社会党统一，而赞成的是属于团结过程中的、以新形式来促进团结的恢复统一，而不是具有相反内容的行动。
    我们也有理由担心——请社会党同志们允许我们提出这种友好批评——因为从一开始起就没有明确表示统一不会意味着社会党接受社会民主党的政治立场（反共反苏以至于我们十分熟悉的一切其他立场）。问题不在于仅仅不谴责、不驳斥社会党至今所执行的政策，这种政策是正确的，人们看出它是正确的，既然社会党以及整个工人运动的威望和力量都因而加强了。
    以往提出过的那些问题，今天又已经出现了，明天还要出现。在今天趋向于弥漫世上的再度冷战的气氛中，应该以过去那样的蓬勃力量来进行新的斗争，而其目标也不会是十分不同的。然而，社会民主党领袖们已经站到同和平进步力量应该具有的立场相反的立场上去了。
    在我们看来，如果认为社会党的重新统一可能意味着追随社会党的巨大的工人和劳动者队伍会站在这种立场上，那是荒谬的。而社会民主党领导人却似乎正是这样认为。他们由于利用了一些错误而洋洋得意，并且受到社会主义的所有敌人的支持。
    我们无论在这个时候或在其他的时候都不愿意同我们的社会党同志们疏远。我们的批评没有这个意思；这些批评也不意味着我们想干预他们的党内问题。但是我们认为维护团结和进行反对右派社会民主党思想和政策——工人运动从1914年到今天所遭受过的最严重的失败的根源——的斗争，是为了我们党和社会党的共同利益。为了维护自己的利益和在社会主义道路上前进，工人阶级应该团结自己的力量而不是使它分裂。孤立工人中最先进的部分——共产党人——就意味着使全部工人群众注定遭受内部分裂、迷失方向和处于混乱状态；而由于我们党的强大，由于我们具有的传统、团结和威望，对我们国家来说就尤其是这样。
    争取建立劳动阶级民主政府，这个政府依靠劳动者的巨大群众组织，维护宪法，保卫和平，实现保卫劳动的经济制度，打开社会主义革新的道路。
    工人阶级维护和加强自己的团结，并不是关门自守，并不是孤立于其他民主、进步力量之外，恰恰相反，是创造了同这些力量进行接触与合作的更好的条件。因为工人阶级这样就有了在战斗中获胜的能力，而这不仅是为了自己当前利益，也是为了一个普遍革新的计划。
    只有这样，才能创造工人阶级和劳动者参加政府和国家领导工作的有利条件，才能使他们像应该的那样成为统治的力量。
    我们从我们的代表大会开始筹备时起就提出的口号——建立劳动阶级民主政府——的出发点和意义就在这里。
    我们用这个口号规定了我们认为具体的、可以实现的一个目标，就是要实现这样一个政府：它体现广泛的政治协议和联盟，而这个协议和联盟代表着大多数劳动人民和他们的工会和政治组织。这样一个政府的议会基础可能具有的形式，在目前无需加以讨论，因为我们也面对着这样一个议会：虽然它的任期还没有满，它在从事革新方面却似乎已经没有任何政治能力可言了。
    我们所规定的目标为实行改变提供了具体办法，而这种改变目的在于革新统治阶层并使劳动者参与领导国家。关于最后一点，人们曾经纷纷谈论，现在还在纷纷谈论。纲领是清楚明白的；这个政府应该采取的行动也是清楚的。
    劳动阶级民主政府应该是维护和平、力求国际缓和与国内缓和、竭力保卫我们的独立的政府。这个政府应该是全面实施和维护宪法的政府，它应该恢复工会权利和尊重劳动者在劳动场所的尊严。
    这个政府应该实现人们在总工会最近一次代表大会上所谈的保卫劳动的经济制度。
    这个政府应该实行普遍土地改革、消灭失业、大力对贫困进行斗争、为劳动男女建立现代化社会保险制度、开始实现迫切必要的结构改革。
    这个政府应该铲除一切歧视，在政治民主的范围内对私人工业和金融垄断资本实施控制，从而摧毁它们现有的绝对权力。
    这个政府应该依靠工人、农民、手工业者、职员、青年和一切劳动者的巨大群众组织。
    这个政府应该受到劳动者、处境恶劣的人、直到现在还受压迫的穷苦人的信任。
    这个政府应该实行共和宪法，从而为我国社会打开社会主义革新的道路。
            党的生活
    同党的生活与活动完全直接有关的问题都应该从这样的认识出发而予以考虑：在意大利，我们是最大的力量，而我们是属于民主和工人运动阵营的。我们是最大的力量，这不仅是由于我们的党员人数和选举中所得到的票数，而且也是由于我们在思想和行动方面的威望；因此，尽管我们处于反对党的地位，可是我们在国家政策的某些重要方面起了决定方向的作用。这种优越性，甚至我们的对手和敌人也承认，尽管他们大吵大嚷鼓动着反对我们。由此可见，我们的责任极为重大。有人作过尝试：使基本人民群众、工人、南部的贫困居民和所有受到最贫困的生活条件压迫的人、日益感受经济革新的需要的那一部分中间阶层劳动者脱离我们，但是这种尝试没有得逞。在某些地方我们的阵地一度部分地削弱。但是这种削弱根本不能被看作一种经过加紧努力也无法扭转的形势的迹象。相反，正是在过去几周中，一部分阶级觉悟较高和较活跃的工人和人民群众，在敌人疯狂袭击之下，紧紧团结在我们的周围了。
    我们的共同正确信念是：这种力量理所当然地是我们在工人运动内部的全部活动的结果，是三十多年来以英雄气概和牺牲精神，以具有根本意义的革命团结进行斗争的结果，而且这种力量是同我们自从1945年起就使我们党具有的那种性质密切有关的。
                          妇女问题
    正如我们当时所说的，这种性质已经是一件新事物。它包括：全部放弃过去的宗派立场；批判认为党是一个半军事组织的有限集团的观念；在吸收党员方面的新的跃进；新的组织形式和工作方式。它尤其包括不懈努力来保持同一切人民阶层的紧密联系，以便能处理问题和在民主范围内进行斗争以求解决有关劳动人民的一切问题——假如人们想领导工人阶级和人民坚持斗争争取民主和社会主义，这些问题都是很重要的。关于党的这种概念，在我们看来是十分清楚的，我们在我们的根本文件中也清楚表达了这种概念。这种概念当然受到同志们的拥护，而且深入了他们的思想。但是，假如我们说：这一概念已经在我们行动的一切方面都已经未加保留地而且未遇抗拒地实现，这种实现因而没有常常是甚至严重地受到限制，而这并不成其为使我们政策降低效用的障碍——假如我们这样说，我们就犯了错误。我们说在我们党的总方针中有着某种“二重性”，我们的出发点正是想到这种抗拒、这些限制和由此而产生的一些错误。“二重性”这个词也许不大好听，因为它似乎包含着道义上予以批判的意味。但是，肯定的是：某些错误既然在同样的行动场合一再重犯，就不能不使人有这种印象：在党的方针方面，有着一种并未公开显露、然而实际存在的分歧。
    试以我们政治方针和组织的特有情况之一：关于妇女运动的问题为例。早在十二年以前，一开始就已经宣布：在意大利的任务是争取妇女解放，这是民主和向社会主义推进的中心问题之一，我们应该力求开展广泛的自主的民主妇女运动，而它的目的应该是妇女解放。因此，有必要特别注意一切妇女问题，特别注意吸收妇女党员，吸收她们参加工会、妇女组织；也有必要专门努力来研究关于妇女、关于培养和提拔妇女干部的问题。不错，在这条道路上有了进展，然而是费了很大的气力的！
    有种错误的意见认为没有什么专门的妇女问题，在工会斗争和政治斗争中妇女只起辅助作用；我们曾经不得不数百次地驳斥这种意见。
    曾经不得不在党内铲除顽固的反动偏见，这种偏见甚至否认有必要存在一个具有自己的任务的妇女群众组织。这就使人感到：党只是一个赞成正确的事情、却丝毫不做这些正确的事情、反而做出错误行动的党。这仅仅是——忽视呢，无能呢，
  还是暗中拒绝支持政治路线呢？拥护一个政治路线不凭言辞，
  而要看促其实现的努力。
                    市政和议会
      我们一向把要求和维护地方自治放在我们的政治要求的中心地位上。眼前的问题极多而且极为重要，不少切身有关和急迫的问题，是可以在地方行政范围内加以解决的。全党同意这种立场而且当然是具有信心地加以接受的。但是，党内那么多的积极分子只是在选举关头才注意地方行政问题，以致即使不丧失前此争得的阵地，却不能从敌人手里夺得阵地——这种情况怎样解释呢？
    在我们全部政治战略和战术中对议会的重视，是大家及时知悉和赞同的。但是，除了若干惊人的决定性战役而外，在利用议会方面还够不上这种政治行动路线的水准。党整套的机构恰恰不包括议会工作在内，也不给予以必要的重视。中央机构本身不是始终能贯彻有效指示的。让我们希望：议会党团最近作出的关于议会任务、特别是关于我们的议员任务的决议，将成为大力纠正的起点。
                  工作中的弱点
    大家都知道，无论是领导机构或外地党组织的所有集会上，人们都强调指出我们必须在即使同工人阶级疏远的社会阶层中以及在还敌视我们的劳动者队伍中进行工作。在这方面，大量的创议已经着手执行，而且往往是有了成果，获得了良好成绩，例如对山地居民、手工业者、职员、领养老金的人、战争受害者等所作的事情。
    但是不能否认这种工作是零零碎碎而且时断时续的。人们几乎忽视了对小土地耕种者的工作，而这些耕种者恰恰特别需要引导，以求摆脱教会和商业界人士的控制，商业界人士力图把这些耕种者视为专供自己猎取的对象。又例如，虽然人们纷纷谈论，写文章主张必须同天主教劳动群众举行会谈，但是，接近天主教劳动群众从而争取他们的工作，作得很不够而且时断时续，而在天主教劳动群众中间正有人不断表现出寻求反对现有制度的新的斗争道路。然而，凡是作了接近和争取工作的地方，就得到了重要的成绩。
    但是，即使在我们巩固、发展、加强和维护党和工人阶级的联系的工作方面，难道我们不也在这个本当是我们的主要工作上看到发现过迟和纠正过迟的严重的缺点，这些缺点在后来工厂选举中令人不愉快地暴露出来么？在工厂中的劳工阵线是党的主要阵线。不过这是一个多方面的阵线。局势远没有被尽量利用，工会斗争远没有完结。今天这种斗争往往是极其艰巨的，常常不能获得预期的结果。党组织应该在困难关头进行宣传鼓动组织工作，但是要使每一个斗争，即使不以充分胜利而结束，也能促成工人阶级觉悟的提高，使他们显示出更坚定的决心：组织起来、团结起来，以更坚强更有效的行动阵线来对抗剥削者。每一个党组织应该善于永远同劳动者打成一片，应该有明确的工作计划来执行这个任务和领导工人的斗争。
    人们可以就我们的工作的其他或多或少重要的方面提出甚至严厉的批评，在代表大会期间一定会有这种情况。但是，当我们说代表大会应当加强党，当我们强调这两项任务，同时把它们密切联系起来的时候，我们的意思是不是仅仅说：必须发扬批评与自我批评从而揭露一切过失而要求党予以纠正呢？决不是这个意思。你们记得，第四次全国会议是像准备一次代表大会一样仔细准备的，如果说这次全国会议并不完全令人满意，但是它也远没有只限于提出批评。在这次会议上往往坚决有力地提出的批评和指出的解决办法，大体上仍然是正确的，不过其中一大部分始终没有执行。在这次代表大会上，也将就我们的工作的一切方面多多提出批评，而且应该这样作。但是当我们谈论到要革新，显然我们指的是除了批评之外还有别的。
    为了促使大家了解这一点，回溯一下最近几年的事态发展不是无益的。在反对（选举）欺骗性法律获得巨大胜利之后，全国和我们党当时面临着一种新局面。不能说党中央没有了解这一点。只需回溯我们在1953年10月间举行的会议就够了。人们在这次会议上要求党趁着赢得了胜利的机会，大力采取多种形式的、广泛的、而以一切阶层的劳动人民为对象的活动，并以他们的当前利益以及众人理解的实施广泛改革的新政策的必要性为依据。当时党并不缺乏方针，所缺少的是实现这种政策的蓬勃精神。当时也到处缺乏深信这一政策正确的信念。于是就表现出举棋不定，再加上未能及时重视当时已经在经济方面和其他方面的动向上发生的变化。在谢尔巴执政时期，有过许许多多具有重大意义的创举和斗争，这个时期终以民主力量和我们党获得胜利为结束。但是不能否认：在1953年之后，大体上说，我们的政治主动一度较差，而党也曾经有些闭门自守。
    从这种批评中，就可以很清楚地看出我们今天所要求的革新是什么。党的革新阵线纯粹是一个面向外部的阵线，这个阵线包含着党的政治活动和它的工作方法。它不能成为单纯的一种鞭策。它首先涉及更完善和更好地制定我们的政治纲领，以达到更深刻地探求走向社会主义的意大利道路的目的。它涉及更详尽地分析民主改革和社会主义革命的原动力。它涉及在反对大垄断权力的斗争中更广泛和更自由地寻求工人阶级的同盟军。它关系到肯定我们所要求的结构改革、这些改革的价值和获得它们的办法。它关系到我们又一次把普遍的土地改革提到首要地位，工人阶级正为实现这种改革而斗争，而农民们也在为此而斗争。它关系到更好地了解我们行动的民主方法和最好地了解争取民主在向社会主义发展过程中的价值。
    为实现党的路线和争取走向社会主义的意大利道路的斗争，是党的革新工作的中心任务。能够阻止我们沿着这条道路前进的是什么？两个主要的障碍：最高纲领派的宗派主义和改良主义派的修正主义。前者闭门自守，等待着鸿运的来到；后者在资本主义面前屈膝，等待资本主义自己变成社会主义。两者都拒绝采取革命行动来争取社会主义。我们在某些同志们对于世界目前所发生的新鲜事件的估计中曾经感觉到后者的某些影响。前者在我们的队伍中更为根深蒂固，这是由于过去的经历和我们运动的旧有传统。改良主义所能给予工人阶级的损害是最严重的，因为改良主义使革命朝气熄灭并引向消极。但是一个宗派主义闭门自守的政党不可能有效地同改良主义展开斗争，这样的党是一个不充分相信自己政治路线的正确性、不能为实现这种政治路线而斗争的党。因此，争取消灭这些障碍的个别斗争就彼此联系而且互为条件了。寻求表现这种斗争的方式和进行这种斗争的方式，就应该同正确地了解党的任务和实现党的任务相连系起来。这种连系并不是在所有各省委员会最近的代表大会上都受到正确的强调和重视的，而凡是发生这种情况的地方，就是一个严重的缺点。
      我刚刚所说的一切，可以使人了解党的内部生活和活动等问题所具有的巨大重要性。我所谴责的无能力实现正确的政策的局部现象和宗派主义关门倾向，在党内的表现形式是官僚主义的生硬作风以及对活动方式和民主生活的方式的限制。因此可以知道，要加强全党的政治水平和工作能力，就应该集中向这个方向开火。因此，这在党内就成为主要任务了。
    第二十次代表大会上的揭露和结论所引起的严重问题一经提到党和工人运动面前，它们就不能不同纯粹是我们自己的问题的一些问题混杂起来，于是进行革新的必要性就完全显露出来了。
    代表大会之前所进行的争论已经是一个新事情，我们认为它具有高度的积极意义。通过这次争论，党看见了威胁着它的危险是什么：实际上同敌人错误和污蔑的立场完全一致的、却以不与权威求一致的面貌出现的立场渗入了党的队伍，出现了某些修正主义见解，出现了某些不负责任的失败主义倾向，而这些都是脱离我们的原则的，是对构成我们财富的丰富思想和工作予以不正确估价的。
    党对于这些危险有了良好的反应，党击退了它们，并且团结一致寻找自己革新的道路。讨论进行得广泛而自由，为很久以来在任何一个党内所没有见过的。说知识分子同志们的参加讨论起了消极作用，或者说某些谴责不能不在他们当中造成比别人严重的惊慌失措和垂头丧气情绪，是不真实的。他们当中的某些人曾经比别人更为不安，而且表现出一种违反纪律的宗派活动倾向，但是随后就克服了这种情况。相反，由此却显出了知识分子同志们有必要在正常的机构中同整个党的生活建立更密切的关系，为这种生活作出愈来愈大的贡献，而且不要仅仅在举行争论的大场合上才作出贡献。
    法国同志因为我们据说是对于采取错误立场的人们作出了不必要的不正确的让步，所以对我们提出了友好的批评。我们并没有作出任何让步；我们对于已经引起的各种问题的严重性是有认识的；我们对派系活动和无纪律行为已经加以谴责，并且使那些做出这种行动的人也谴责自己这种活动和行为；对于抱有分歧意见的人，我们则同他们进行了自由讨论，以便说服他们并且争取他们站到我们正确的政治立场上来。直到现在，结果是积极的，方式是正确的，因为这是一个希望把党员团结和力量建立在自觉的合乎理性的同意之上、而不是建立在顺从之上的党所采用的正常领导方式。
    在全党之内沟通思想，必须从两个方面进行：既要自上而下，也要自下而上。不能够硬要来自下面的思想、意见和建议只能够提得十全十美，而且永远完全正确。讨论正是用来发展这些思想、意见和建议，并且从中归纳出一切必要的结论。我们采取这种作法也是因为我们意识到：这种形式的沟通思想在我们队伍中还是相当缺乏的，尽管我们说了许多话并且作出了不少决定来予以推动。凡是没有被巩固地说服而相信党的政策是正确的同志，他们就难于为其实现而努力。因此，号召发扬党内民主和号召为消除党内民主所受到的人为限制而斗争，就是号召在政治上发挥更大的效能，就是号召绝大多数同志更进一步不断加强活动，因此，也就是使得我们能够更好地完成我们的一切任务。
    就因为这个缘故，我们争取革新的行动才具有那样重大的意义。只有依靠这种行动，我们才能前进，胜利前进，那怕环境极为艰巨。
    希望我们能够去除由于不大老练的同志的行为而浮到表面上来的、只能束缚我们革新行动的那些残渣。在举行关于我们党内生活的讨论和关于在我们队伍中沟通思想的问题的讨论当中，有人走私似地运进了一些立场，我认为这些立场就是残渣。首先，例如，“派系活动”这种破坏纪律原则和破坏党的团结的行为，而党的团结却是党的力量的基础，要获得党的团结，就应该遵守我们党章中所规定的民主集中制准则。再如，要求在党内组织派系，而这种事情是不利于沟通思想的，它只会阻碍思想的沟通，只会把民主生活降低为不能容许的腐朽的议会纷争的形式。上述这些都是十分错误的领导方式的残余（这种错误也许是不自觉的）：这类领导方式的表现之一是要求采用军阀主义特有的办法，即，只要一个干部犯了一次错误，不管他的能力如何，绝对要把他从工作中排斥出去。要培养老练的党干部，就不能这样，而是应该在予以批评之后帮助同志们来纠正错误、改进工作，在维护我们政策的斗争中加强团结。再例如，以高尚的自我牺牲精神全心全意献身于党的工作的干部们，却受到不能容许的抱怨。让我们毫不迟疑地抛弃这些走私货吧！
    关于选举领导机构的秘密投票，报纸上已经说了许多话。我们的党章一向保证这种秘密性质（只需提出要求），在这次会上也是要这样办的。但是，必须提醒一下：保证党的民主的，不是这种或者那种投票方式，而是全党工作的方式。
    在旧社会党中，大会上党内各派的席次分配，往往是用表面上的投票来实现的。
    意共是领导意大利工人阶级争取解放的革命政党。它的任务是对阶级敌人进行斗争，组织工人阶级的政治经济运动，争取民主和社会主义。
    我们不是一个辩论家的政党，而是一个革命政党，为了行动、为了战斗而建立的党。我们是这样的一个阶级的党：这个阶级今天受着剥削和压迫，它需要坚强有力的、团结一致的引导者来争取解放。我们是这样的一个党：它应该依据运动的发展情况来完成日益更新的、日益广泛的任务。为此，我们应该有一个永远有效的组织，我们应该依靠智慧的、有能力的党员革命干部来维护这个组织。掀起一个发动这些党员的新高潮吧！从工厂，从农村，从学校掀起这个高潮来促进我们所希望的革新吧！让我们在必要的地方削减领导机构的人数，并且吸收生产中活跃的工人和劳动者参加政治领导和实际领导吧！让我们简化工作，从而使得工作更为有效吧！让我们多多学习，努力工作，并且在人民中间、在人民前列展开斗争吧！只有依靠劳动者和战斗者的生气勃勃的民主的党，争取民主、争取社会主义的斗争才得以进行。
    一切任务就这样地汇合起来了，那就是要更好地掌握我们的学说，进行思想和实际的探讨，认识新事物和不断产生的事物，认识需要得到一致判断和适当行动的事物，对阶级敌人提高警惕和进行斗争，组织工人阶级的政治经济运动，争取民主和社会主义，创造无产阶级和人民需要用来争取民主和社会主义的工具。
    让我们敌人的幻想破灭吧！我们所以遇到困难、我们所以进行讨论、我们所以总是要辩论一些新问题，是因为我们已经到达我们发展的新阶段，在我们面前展开了新的广阔的远景。
    社会主义世界在前进。社会主义世界在不断革新。自由、社会进步与和平的旗帜掌握在坚定的手里。我们的党在已经确定的道路上前进。我们这么多年来坚忍不拔地忠心耿耿地为党工作，我们由于建立了共产党从而完成了历史加诸我们的任务而感到自豪，请让我们对这个工人阶级的产物、善于引导工人阶级和意大利全体人民胜利建设民主和社会主义社会的这个党泰然表示信心吧！
    意大利共产党万岁！
    劳动者的国际团结万岁！
    民主、社会主义、和平万岁！
