    They Maintain a Style of Hard Work and Plain Living
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Li Zuoji
    Under the influence of the hard-working and simple lifestyle of the two successive directors of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, most of the staff members are able to frequently go deep into the countryside to connect with the masses. The department has also consistently paid attention to saving every penny in its expenditure. The office expenses saved in the first ten months of this year are equivalent to 20% of the budget.
    Many comrades who have worked in the Guangdong Provincial Department of Civil Affairs especially miss their directors. A hard-working and simple lifestyle is the traditional style of every director of this department.
    The comrades here always like to start by talking about the former director, Comrade Zhu Rong.
    Zhu Rong worked in the Department of Civil Affairs for six years, but he never cared about his personal enjoyment. The province originally allocated a small western-style house for him to live in, in the most beautiful residential area of Guangzhou - Dongshan, but he thought it was too far from the department and from his comrades. For many years, he has been living in the department and eating with his comrades. He was not fussy about food. The cooks often said that it was easiest to cook for Director Zhu. He also dressed plainly. Apart from the set of coarse woolen uniform issued to him by the government in 1950, he always wore cloth uniforms. When his clothes were torn, he would mend them and wear them again.
    In May 1953, he went to Yingde, Qingyuan and other counties to guide disaster relief work. The Lianjiangkou District of Yingde County knew that the director was coming, so they sent two staff members to pick him up, but they couldn't find the director at the station. It turned out that Zhu Rong had already carried his luggage to the district committee himself.
    Zhu Rong often forgot to rest when he was working. He didn't have holidays or Sundays. He cared about the lives of the masses more than he cared about himself. If it didn't rain for ten and a half days, or if it rained for several days in a row, he would become anxious, thinking about whether there would be floods or droughts below. Sometimes, when the wind blew in the middle of the night, he would get out of bed and wait by the telephone, asking about the situation in various counties. He often taught the comrades in the department: "When it's cold, you have to think that the farmers there may not have quilts. If it rains heavily for three consecutive days, you should think about whether there will be floods."
    The current director, Comrade Guan Shan, took office in March last year. He suffers from severe stomach problems and neurasthenia, but he still maintains the excellent style of the former director.
    Before he took office, he had just come out of a sanatorium, and his health had not yet recovered. The leadership originally wanted him to rest for another period of time. But at that time, it was the season when the crops were not yet ripe in the countryside, so he immediately canceled his plan to continue his recuperation. The next day, he went to the department to find out about the situation, and on the third day, he personally went to Wuchuan, Maoming, Dianbai and other counties to guide disaster relief work, which lasted for nearly two months. In the Seventh District of Wuchuan County, he walked on mountain roads in the middle of the night for more than a week, going deep into the villages and farmers' households to understand the difficulties in farmers' lives and help them solve problems. At that time, some district cadres saw that he was not in good health and often suffered from insomnia at night, and that he was so tired, they wanted to buy him something good to eat, but he refused.
    As soon as he returned to the department from the countryside, he listened to some reports, and two or three days later, he went to Haifeng County to go deep into a village in Xinliao Township, which was more severely affected by the famine, to understand the situation. There were more than fifty households in this village, and he visited most of them. After learning the real situation, he instructed that 50,000 yuan in relief funds be allocated, and he discussed with the grain department to transfer 20,000 dan of rice to Haifeng County. After the local Party and government cadres vigorously led the work of production and disaster relief, they finally stopped the development of the disaster there. At that time, although Guan Shan's stomach disease was very serious, he still ate sweet potatoes and porridge with the farmers until the problem was solved, and then he went to the district to ask a doctor for treatment.
    The hard-working and simple lifestyle of the directors has influenced the staff of the entire department. Most of them often go deep into the countryside to understand the actual work situation. When they go to the countryside, they go directly to the farmers' households to help the farmers solve their difficulties. Therefore, when the farmers see that it is the staff from the Department of Civil Affairs, they all express their welcome.
    The department also pays attention to saving money at any time and in any place in terms of expenditure. Whenever they hold large-scale meetings, they try to live more crowdedly themselves, making room for the people attending the meeting to live in, not renting hotels, and saving expenses for the country. Usually, the staff members also supervise each other to save water, electricity and office supplies. All the desks, chairs, tables and cabinets that the Department of Civil Affairs has now were mostly taken over at the time of liberation, or were made by processing old wood. In recent years, the documents, forms, envelopes, etc. issued by the department have also been printed using waste paper. They do not prepare cigarettes or snacks for the meetings they hold. Since the beginning of this year, the staff of the department have also been making their own paste and repairing bicycles, paying attention to saving office expenses bit by bit. From January to October, the office expenses they saved were equivalent to 20% of the original budget expenditure.

    他们保持了艰苦朴素的作风
    新华社记者　黎作骥
    广东省民政厅的工作人员在先后两位厅长艰苦朴素作风的影响之下，大部能够经常深入农村联系群众。厅里的经费开支也一贯注意一点一滴的节约。今年头十个月节约的办公费相当预算的20％。
    曾经在广东省民政厅工作过的许多同志，都特别怀念他们的厅长。艰苦朴素是这个厅每一个厅长的传统作风。
    这里的同志们谈起来总爱从前任厅长朱荣同志谈起。
    朱荣在民政厅工作了六年，但是他从来没有计较过个人的生活享受。省里本来在广州最优美的住宅区——东山拨一幢小洋房给他住，可是他认为那儿离厅太远，离同志们远。这许多年，他就一直住在厅里，并且在厅里和同志们一起吃饭。吃东西他不去过分讲究，炊事员常说，替朱厅长做菜最容易。他穿得也很朴素，除了1950年领过公家发给的一套粗呢子制服以外，一直穿的布制服，衣服破了，缝补以后又照样穿上。
    1953年5月，他有一次到英德、清远等县指导救灾工作。英德县连江口区知道厅长下来，便派了两位工作人员去接，可是在车站上找遍了也找不到厅长，原来朱荣早已自己背着行李走到区委会了。
    朱荣工作起来常常忘记休息，他没有假期和星期天。他关心群众的生活甚于关心自己。如果十天半月不下雨，或者一连下了几天雨，他就焦急起来，想着下面是否会闹水灾或旱灾。有时半夜刮风，他就从床上起身守候在电话机旁，询问各县的情况。他常常教导厅里同志们说：“冷了，你要想到那里的农民可能没有被盖，连续下三天大雨，你应该想到是否会发生水灾。”
    现任厅长关山同志是在去年3月到职的。他患有严重的胃病和神经衰弱症，但是他仍然保持了前任厅长的优良作风。
    他到职之前，刚从疗养院出来，健康仍未恢复，领导上原来让他再休息一个时期。但是那时正是农村青黄不接时期，他马上取消了继续休养的打算，第二天到厅里了解一下情况，第三天便亲自到吴川、茂名、电白等县指导救灾工作，一去就是近两个月。他在吴川县第七区，曾经连续一个多星期地半夜走山路，深入乡村农户，了解农民生活上的困难，帮助他们解决问题。那时，一些区干部见他身体本来不好，晚上常失眠不能入睡，加上这样劳累，想买点好的东西给他吃，但是却被他拒绝了。
    他下乡刚回到厅里来，听了一些汇报，两三天后又到海丰县去，深入到灾荒比较严重的新寮乡的一个村庄了解情况。这个村庄有五十多户，他大部分都挨户访问过。在了解到真实情况以后，他便指示拨出救济款五万元，并且和粮食部门研究调拨了两万担大米到海丰县。经过当地党和政府部门干部大力领导生产救灾工作，终于制止了那里灾情的发展。那时，关山的胃病虽然发作得很厉害，他还是和农民一起吃甘薯、稀饭，直到问题得到解决，才到区里请医生诊治。
    厅长们的艰苦朴素作风，影响了全厅的工作人员。他们大部分都经常深入农村，了解实际工作情况。他们下乡的时候，都是直接深入农户，帮助农民解决困难。因此，农民一见是民政厅来的工作人员，都表示欢迎。
    厅里在经费开支方面也都随时随地注意节约。每当召开较大规模的会议的时候，他们自己都尽量住得挤一些，腾出地方给参加会议的人住，不租旅店，为国家节省开支。平常，工作人员们也互相督促节约用水、用电和办公用品。民政厅现有的一切桌、椅、台、柜，大都是解放的时候接收下来的，或者是利用旧木料加工制成的。几年来，厅里印发的文件、表报、信封等也是利用废纸印制的。他们召开的会议不备香烟、点心。今年以来，厅里工作人员还自己煮浆糊、修理脚踏车，注意一点一滴地节约办公费。从1月到10月，他们节约的办公费相当于原来预算开支的20％。
