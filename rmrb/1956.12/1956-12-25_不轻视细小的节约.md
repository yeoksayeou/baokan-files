    The Achievements of Eighteen Young People in an Organization
    Eighteen young people in the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's administrative department launched a "No Stationery Month" campaign. They sorted out and utilized discarded paper and office supplies to save on administrative expenses. Young clerks in the document section used their spare time to renovate old envelopes, pasting together more than 30,000 envelopes. One mimeograph operator alone pasted together 2,700. Youth League member Hu Qing discovered that some telegrams didn't need to be sent as "express telegrams" when sending them every day, and actively suggested changing them to "ordinary telegrams." Youth League member Zhang Xuankuan also repaired a discarded typewriter. Since March of this year, these eighteen young people have saved approximately 10,000 yuan.
    The Wealth in the "Recycling Box"
    At the Benxi Mining Bureau's electromechanical plant, many young workers would bend down to pick up a nail or a small piece of iron they saw on the road and send it to the "recycling box."
    The plant's Youth League organization launched a "waste material" recycling campaign among young workers at the beginning of this year. From January to the end of November this year, they recovered nearly 10,000 yuan worth of wealth.
    Do Not Waste a Lump of Coal, a Drop of Oil
    "Do not waste a lump of coal, a drop of oil!" This is the Benxi Railway Bureau's employees' slogan for conservation. Since the beginning of this year, the coal saved by the crew members is enough to supply a train traveling back and forth from Benxi to Andong more than 260 times. They have saved over 1,200 yuan in grease costs by saving oil bit by bit.
    This year, the crew members of this railway bureau have earnestly studied the experience of the railway department in saving coal and oil. Each chartered train group comes up with ways to save money based on the weather conditions, cargo load, and direction of travel each time they go to work. Now, more than 80% of the chartered train groups in this section have saved coal or oil.
    Workers Calculate Accounts and Claim Materials Themselves
    The Benxi Coking Plant now makes every worker who comes to claim materials aware of the price of the materials, so that they can calculate the cost themselves.
    When maintenance worker Wei Guochang went to the warehouse to claim ten kilograms of screws, he only claimed two kilograms when he learned that one kilogram of screws was worth two yuan. After taking the materials back, he and the workers found some old screws that could still be used as substitutes. Recycling workshop springs are worth ninety-three yuan each. Knowing the price, the workers found many old springs for processing, and the processing cost was only three yuan. Now, materials for springs alone have saved more than 3,000 yuan.
    The factory uses about 200 kilograms of rags to wipe machines every month, and each kilogram of rags is worth one yuan and six jiao. Worker Tang Baoquan said: "I won't throw away my old gloves anymore, I'll use them!"
    In this way, the entire factory saved more than 7,000 yuan in material costs in forty days.

### 不轻视细小的节约

    不轻视细小的节约
    新华社记者　徐家柱
    十八个机关青年的劳绩
    本溪钢铁公司行政处十八个青年展开了“不领文具月”的活动。他们把过去随地扔掉的纸张和办公用品加以整理、利用，来节约行政开支。文书科青年职员利用空隙时间，把旧信封翻新，糊成了三万多个信封，油印员一个人就糊了两千七百个。青年团员胡清每天拍发电报时，发现没有必要发“加急电”的电报，就积极建议改发“普通电”。青年团员张宣宽还修理好了报废的打字机。从今年3月以来，这十八个青年共节约了约一万元。
    “回收箱”里的财富
    在本溪矿务局机电厂里，许多青年工人走在路上，看到一枚钉子，一小块铁，也要弯腰拾起来，送到“回收箱”去。
    这个厂青年团组织今年年初就组织青年工人展开“废料”回收活动。今年1月到11月底，他们回收了将近一万元的财富。
    不浪费一块煤，一滴油
    “不浪费一块煤，一滴油！”这是本溪机务段职工的节约口号。今年以来，乘务员们节省的煤，能供给一列火车从本溪到安东来回行驶二百六十多趟。他们一点一滴地节约用油，已节省下一千二百多元油脂费。
    这个机务段乘务员们今年认真学习了铁道部门省煤、省油的经验。每个包车组每次出勤，都根据天气情况、载货量和运行方向，想出节约办法。现在，这个段有80％以上的包车组节省了煤，或节省了油。
    工人自己算账领料
    本溪焦化厂现在让每个去领料的工人都知道材料的价格，使他们自己会算成本账。
    检修工人魏国昌到仓库去领十公斤螺丝，当他知道一公斤螺丝值两元钱的时候，就只领了两公斤。他领料回去后，就和工人们找到一些还可以利用的旧螺丝代替了。回收车间弹簧每个值九十三元。工人们知道了价格，就找到许多旧弹簧加工，加工成本只要三元钱。现在仅弹簧一项材料就节约了三千多元。
    这个厂每月要用擦机器的破布大约二百公斤，破布每公斤值一元六角。工人唐宝全说：“我以后破手套不扔掉，也要利用它！”
    这样，全厂在四十天内就节约了材料费七千多元。
