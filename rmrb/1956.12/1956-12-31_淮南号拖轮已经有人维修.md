    The Huainan Tugboat is Already Being Repaired
    The Third Ship Repair Factory of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration wrote to say: The article "The Tugboat That Has Been Sleeping for Two and a Half Years" published in the People's Daily on September 8, criticizing the delay in repairing the Huainan tugboat (Yangtze No. 123 tugboat), is true. This tugboat was originally moored near the Sino-Foreign Joint Venture Nanjing Ship Repair Factory and the property rights belonged to the Nanjing Port of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration. Recently, the higher authorities have instructed that it be handed over to our factory. We will soon send personnel to take over the repair.

    淮南号拖轮已经有人维修
    长江航运管理局第三船舶修理厂来信说：9月8日人民日报发表的
  “睡了两年半的拖轮”一文，批评淮南号拖轮（长江一二三号拖轮）迟迟没人维修，是真实的。这只拖轮原在公私合营南京船舶修理厂附近停泊，产权属于长江航运管理局南京港。最近上级已经指示将它交给我厂。我们即将派员接管维修。
