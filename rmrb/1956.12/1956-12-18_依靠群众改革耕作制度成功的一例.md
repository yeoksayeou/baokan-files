Xingzi County, Jiangxi Province, which has made significant achievements in reforming the cultivation system, reaped a bumper harvest of more than 96,000 mu of double-cropping rice this year. The average yield per mu was 662 jin, an increase of 21.5% compared to the average yield of double-cropping rice last year, turning the historically grain-deficient county into a surplus-grain county.

Xingzi County, backing onto Mount Lu and facing Poyang Lake, has lower temperatures than the counties in southern and eastern Jiangxi. The average annual temperature is around 18 degrees Celsius. For a long time, farmers here believed that the weather was cold and the wind was strong, and they could only grow one crop of medium-season rice per year. Therefore, although Xingzi County has an average of more than two mu of land per person, the county as a whole is still short of grain.

In 1951, after the land reform, the unit area yield of rice fields in the county rapidly increased to 350 to 400 jin, which was unprecedented in any previous year. However, what methods could be used to continue increasing production? This was a question that the Party organization and the masses of farmers in Xingzi County had to constantly consider. In the autumn of 1952, cadres of the Xingzi County Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered in Gutian Township that a farmer named Cheng Shicheng had obtained a bumper harvest by converting 1.1 mu of land to double-cropping rice. In addition to the yield of early rice being close to the yield of one crop of medium-season rice, the late rice also yielded more than 300 jin. This fact inspired the cadres in charge of production and made them realize that to continue increasing production, they should start by reforming the cultivation system. At that time, the County Committee summarized Cheng Shicheng's experience in conversion.

In 1953, based on Cheng Shicheng's experience, the County Committee, in the relatively good production conditions of Happiness Township, led several advanced farmers to convert 13 mu of land to double-cropping rice, all of which were successful. Farmer Zhu Xianguo's conversion of more than 1.4 mu of land increased production by 60%. This matter attracted great attention from nearby farmers, and the County Committee further realized that under the natural conditions of Xingzi County, it was possible to grow double-cropping rice just like the counties on the east or south bank of Poyang Lake, which was the best way to increase grain production substantially. However, there was still a lack of systematic experience regarding the conditions required for conversion and the technical measures to be taken; the conversion had only been successful on small plots of land; and only a few advanced farmers knew the benefits of conversion and were willing to convert. Therefore, the County Committee believed that the next step should be to continue trial planting in some mutual aid and cooperation organizations under leadership.

In 1954, it was originally decided to trial plant 2,000 mu in the county. However, in the summer, there was a flood, and the early and medium-season rice were flooded. After the flood receded, the County Committee led the farmers to try their best to replant autumn crops, and as a result, they rushed to plant more than 5,900 mu of late rice. Except for a small number of late rice crops that suffered reduced yields due to improper planting varieties and delayed harvest periods, the vast majority of them achieved bumper harvests, with an average yield of more than 200 jin per mu, and the highest reaching 400 jin.

After the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Institute of Agricultural Science received this news, they specially sent technicians to conduct a comprehensive investigation and research on the successful technical experience of converting to double-cropping rice with the County Committee and the People's Committee. They found from several typical investigations that those who adopted early-maturing varieties and early sowing and early transplanting in both early and late seasons were successful, while those who did the opposite failed. This affirmed the experience. In addition, it was learned that conversion to double-cropping rice must also have sufficient water sources, abundant fertilizer, strong manpower, and strong draft cattle.

After that, the County Committee held several special meetings to study this in detail, believing that the conditions for popularizing double-cropping rice in the county were already in place. First, most areas of the county have more people and less land, and the manpower and cattle power can meet the needs of cultivation; second, there are early-maturing and high-yielding fine varieties of both early and late rice; third, the fact that successive years of successful conversion to double-cropping rice has educated the broad masses of farmers. In order to carry out this reform steadily, the County Committee also decided not to plant in cold water fields, not to plant in areas with more land and fewer people, and not to plant late rice in fields that cannot be transplanted before "Liqiu" (the Beginning of Autumn). On these bases, in 1955, it was decided to convert 30,000 mu, and preparations were actively made in all aspects. First of all, many farmland water conservancy projects were built according to the autumn droughts of previous years; a fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched, proposing to accumulate 90 dan of fertilizer per mu; and technical training points were established mainly by agricultural mutual aid and cooperative organizations to hold technical training classes and widely impart conversion techniques and advanced cultivation experience. This year, Xingzi County achieved significant achievements in converting to double-cropping rice, with an increase in grain production of 6.6 million jin.

This spring, the county achieved agricultural collectivization. When formulating production plans, agricultural cooperatives have successively determined to take the conversion to double-cropping rice as the main measure to increase production, converting more than 96,000 mu of rice fields, accounting for 79% of the total area of rice fields in the county. Due to the accumulation of conversion experience over the past few years, the fact of increased production has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Coupled with the favorable conditions after collectivization, the double-cropping rice converted this year in the county has also achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest.

The successful fact that Xingzi County has converted to double-cropping rice for many years inspires people that the reform of the cultivation system must be adapted to local conditions, gradually promoted, rely on the masses, and mobilize the masses.

    依靠群众改革耕作制度成功的一例
    新华社记者　岳革新
    改革耕作制度有重大成就的江西省星子县，今年改种的九万六千多亩双季稻大丰收，平均每亩产六百六十二斤，比去年改种的双季稻平均增产21.5％，使历来缺粮的县变成了余粮县。
    星子县背靠庐山，面临鄱阳湖，气温比江西南部和东部各县都低，常年平均温度在摄氏十八度左右。从很远的年代起，这里的农民都认为天冷、风大，每年只能种一季中稻。因此，星子县虽然平均每人有两亩多地，但全县还是缺粮。
    1951年，土地改革以后，全县稻田单位面积产量曾经迅速提高到三百五十斤到四百斤，这是以往任何年景都没有过的。但是，用什么办法来继续增产呢？这是摆在星子县党组织和农民群众面前的一个经常要考虑的问题。1952年秋天，中共星子县委员会的干部在古田乡发现农民程世城在一亩一分田里改种双季稻获得丰收的事，这块田里除早稻产量接近于一季中稻的产量以外，晚稻还收获了三百多斤。这个事实启发了领导生产的干部，认识到要继续提高产量应该从改革耕作制度着手。当时，县委总结了程世城改种的经验。
    1953年，县委根据程世城的经验，在生产条件较好的幸福乡，领导几户先进农民改种了十三亩双季稻，全部获得成功。农民朱贤国改种的一亩四分多田，产量增加60％。这件事情引起附近农民很大注意，县委也进一步认识到在星子县的自然条件下，同样可以和鄱阳湖东岸或南岸各县一样地种植双季稻，这是大量增产粮食的最好办法。但是对改种双季稻应该具备哪些条件，采取哪些技术措施等，还缺乏比较系统的经验；改种还只是在小块土地上试验成功；知道改种好处和愿意改种的也还只是少数的先进农民。因此，县委认为下一步还只能在一些互助合作组织中继续有领导地试种。
    1954年，原来决定在全县试种二千亩。但是夏天遇到水灾，早、中稻被淹。水退之后，县委领导农民想尽一切办法补种秋作物，结果抢栽了五千九百多亩晚稻。这些晚稻除了少数因为种植的品种不当，收获期延迟而减收以外，绝大部分都得到丰收，平均每亩收两百斤以上，最高的收到了四百斤。
    江西省农业厅和农业科学研究所得到这个消息以后，特地派来技术人员同县委和县人民委员会全面调查研究了改种双季稻成功的技术经验。他们从几个典型调查中发现，凡是早晚两季采用早熟品种和提早播种、提早插秧的都获得成功，反之都失败了。从而肯定了这项经验。另外了解到，改种双季稻还必须具备水源足、肥料多、人力强、耕牛壮等条件。
    此后，县委就召开几次专门会议加以详细研究，认为在全县推广双季稻的条件已经具备。第一，全县多数地区人多田少，人力牛力都能适应耕作需要；第二，早晚稻都有了早熟丰产优良品种；第三，连年改种双季稻成功的事实教育了广大农民群众。为了稳步地进行这一改革，县委还决定冷水田不种，田多人少地区不种，“立秋”前栽不上晚稻的田不种。在这些基础上，1955年确定改种三万亩，并且从各方面积极作了准备。首先根据历年秋旱情况兴修了很多农田水利工程；开展积肥运动，提出每亩要积肥九十担；以农业互助合作组织为主成立了技术传授点，举办技术训练班，普遍传授了改种技术和先进耕作经验。这一年，星子县改种双季稻获得了重大成就，全县增产粮食六百六十万斤。
    今年春天全县实现农业合作化了。农业社在制定生产计划的时候，纷纷确定以改种双季稻为主要增产措施，改种的稻田九万六千多亩，占全县水田总面积79％。由于几年来积累了改种经验，增产的事实已经深入人心，加上合作化后的有利条件，全县今年改种的双季稻又获得了全面大丰收。
    星子县连年改种双季稻成功的事实，启示人们改革耕作制度一定要因地制宜，逐步推广，依靠群众，发动群众。
