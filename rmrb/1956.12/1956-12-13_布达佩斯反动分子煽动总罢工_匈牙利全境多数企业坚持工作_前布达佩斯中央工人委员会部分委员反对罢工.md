Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 12th: The Budapest Central Workers' Council, which was explicitly dissolved by the Hungarian government on the evening of December 9th, incited a forty-eight-hour general strike on December 11th before its dissolution. On December 11th, due to the incitement and coercion of reactionaries in Budapest, a partial strike occurred, but most enterprises in Budapest and elsewhere persisted in working.

On the 11th, some factory workers in Budapest did not go to work, buses and trams partially stopped running, and most shops, except for food stores, did not open. At the same time, hidden counter-revolutionary elements seized the opportunity to engage in activities, and some terrorists threatened workers to prevent them from going to work. When workers at a bread factory in Budapest went to work, terrorists threw hand grenades. In Buda Hills, bandits planted explosives under tram tracks, destroying a tram. In another area, bandits killed several tram drivers.

However, this strike incitement did not receive the support of the majority of workers. The workers' councils of many factories in Budapest issued appeals opposing the strike incitement. Workers in Csepel, Budapest's largest industrial area, condemned the strike call of the dissolved workers' council and continued to work as usual.

"People's Freedom Daily" published statements on the 11th from the heads of the Hungarian Free Trade Union National Federation, the Ministry of Trade, the Railway Administration, and the Post and Telecommunications Bureau, unanimously condemning the actions inciting strikes and calling on workers to continue working.

In Budapest, government authorities have arrested many instigators and saboteurs and are working to restore order. At the Budapest oil refinery, after eliminating the activities of instigators, the factory was almost entirely in production on the 11th.

News of enterprises working as usual also came from various states. In Dunaújváros, the Metallurgical United Factory, construction enterprises, and other enterprises all worked as usual. In Komló, Pécs, Tatabánya, and other coal regions, thousands of miners were also at work.

Representatives of the workers' councils of the giant enterprises in Miskolc and Ozd, and the Borsod Coal Mine Workers' Council, issued an appeal to the working people of Borsod County, resolutely rejecting provocative calls for strikes and demonstrations.

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th dispatch: According to a TASS report from Budapest, "People's Will" reported on the 11th that Kádár, Prime Minister of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, received several members of the dissolved Budapest Central Workers' Council. Those received were György Kalocsa, an engineer at the Csepel Vegetable Oil Factory, Lajos Varga, who had served as a member of the 14th District Workers' Council, István Babaya, a staff member of the Capital Tram Factory, and István Klieger, a member of the Csepel Workers' Council. They said they were also reflecting the opinions of eight other members of the dissolved Budapest Central Workers' Council.

In their conversation with Kádár, they condemned the strike call issued by the dissolved Budapest Central Workers' Council, pointing out that the strike would obviously cause great harm to the workers and would not only not help restore order and normalize life, but would instead hinder it. They decided to personally visit workers in some large enterprises and tell them that they considered the strike call of the dissolved Budapest Central Workers' Council to be harmful and provocative.

    布达佩斯反动分子煽动总罢工
    匈牙利全境多数企业坚持工作
    前布达佩斯中央工人委员会部分委员反对罢工
    新华社布达佩斯12日电　被匈牙利政府在12月9日晚间明令解散的布达佩斯中央工人委员会，在被解散前曾煽动在12月11日举行四十八小时总罢工。在11日这一天，在布达佩斯由于反动分子的煽动和胁迫，发生了部分罢工，但布达佩斯和其他地方的多数企业仍坚持工作。
    11日，布达佩斯有一部分工厂的工人没有上工，公共汽车和电车部分停开，除食品商店外，其他商店大部分没有营业。在这同时，暗藏的反革命分子趁机活动，某些恐怖分子威胁工人不让他们上工。布达佩斯一个面包工厂的工人上工时，有恐怖分子投掷手榴弹。在布达山，匪徒把炸药埋在电车轨道下面，炸毁了一辆电车。在另一个地区，匪徒打死了几个电车司机。
    但是，这次罢工煽动并没有得到大多数工人的支持。布达佩斯许多工厂的工人委员会发出呼吁，反对罢工煽动。布达佩斯最大的工业区切佩尔的工人们谴责这个已被解散的工人委员会的罢工号召，他们在照常工作。
    “人民自由报”11日登载了匈牙利自由工会全国联合会、贸易部、铁路管理局、邮电局的负责人分别发表的声明，他们一致谴责煽动罢工的行动，号召工人继续工作。
    在布达佩斯，政府当局已经把许多煽动分子和破坏者逮捕起来，并且正在整顿秩序。在布达佩斯石油提炼厂里，由于消除了煽动分子的活动，这个工厂11日几乎全部在进行生产。
    从各州也传来关于各企业照常工作的消息。在多瑙潘泰莱，冶金联合工厂、建筑企业和其他企业都照常工作。在柯姆洛、贝奇、托托巴尼奥和其他煤区，数以千计的矿工也在上工。
    密斯科尔兹和俄斯特的巨型企业的工人委员会和包尔绍德煤矿工人委员会的代表向包尔绍德州的劳动人民发出呼吁书，坚决拒绝举行罢工和示威的挑拨性的号召。新华社12日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：“人民意志报”11日报道，匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔接见了已经被解散的布达佩斯中央工人委员会的几位委员。被接见的是切佩尔植物油厂工程师捷尔吉·卡洛加、曾经担任过第十四区工人委员会委员的拉奥什·瓦尔克、首都电车厂工作人员伊什特万·巴巴亚、切佩尔工人委员会委员伊什特万·克列盖尔。他们说，他们还反映已经解散的布达佩斯中央工人委员会其他八个委员的意见。
    他们在同卡达尔谈话的过程中，谴责已被解散的布达佩斯中央工人委员会发出的罢工号召，他们指出，罢工显然会给工人带来很大的害处，罢工不仅无助于恢复秩序和生活正常化，反而会起阻碍作用。他们决定亲自访问一些大企业的工人，并且把他们认为已被解散的布达佩斯中央工人委员会的罢工号召是有害的和挑拨性的这个看法告诉这些工人。
