    Celebrating the Harvest (and another poem)
    Ba Bo
    The moon has just hung on the treetops,
    Bonfires rise by the riverbank;
    The night wind teases the flames,
    The girls' faces are flushed red.
    The young men put on their wide-brimmed felt hats,
    And adjust the knives at their waists;
    Each sipping through a straw,
    Highland barley wine is like a cool, refreshing spring.
    Songs soar from the ground to the sky,
    The mountains echo in response;
    Who let out a loud "he huo," [Note]
    Making the bonfire jump for joy.
    The girls swing their colorful skirts,
    The young men wave their long sleeves;
    When dance steps appear in the firelight,
    Even the poplar forest sways along.
    Sweet is the highland barley wine,
    Intoxicating is the song of harvest;
    The song stretches longer than one village after another,
    The dance steps circle one hillside after another.
    Note: When Tibetans dance the Guozhuang, someone will make a loud cry when excited. This is called "hitting he huo" (a show of strength in battle). The dancers become even more energetic.
    Fetching Water
    The Suomo River is crystal clear blue,
    A Tibetan girl appears in the water;
    The headscarf is embroidered with blooming flowers,
    A pair of coral earrings sway.
    Her cheeks are like two bright azaleas,
    I don't know what makes her beam with joy;
    She suddenly bends down,
    The river water is stirred up as if the world is turned upside down.
    When the Suomo River gradually calms down,
    She carries the water bucket and walks up the small path to the village.

    庆丰收（外一首）
    巴波
    月亮刚刚挂上树梢，
    河边就升起熊熊篝火；
    夜风戏弄着火苗，
    姑娘们的脸蛋映得绯红。
    小伙子戴好宽边呢帽，
    整理妥腰带上别着的提刀；
    一个个咂着吸管，
    青稞酒像一道清凉的甘泉。
    歌声平地冲霄，
    群山都在应和；
    是谁打了一声高吭的呵吙，〔注〕
    惹得篝火都在欢跳。
    姑娘们摆动着彩裙，
    小伙子挥舞着长袖；
    当火光中现出舞步，
    连白杨林也在跟着晃动。
    甜甜的是青稞酒，
    醉人的是丰收歌；
    歌声长过一个山寨又一个山寨，
    舞步绕过一个山坡又一个山坡。
    注：藏族跳锅庄，兴高彩烈时，有人发出嘹亮的叫声，为之曰打呵伙（战斗时则是示威）。跳锅庄的人更加起劲。
    汲水
    梭磨河蓝得透亮，
    在水中出现了一个藏族姑娘；
    头帕上绣着朵朵鲜花，
    一对珊瑚耳环直摇晃。
    她的脸颊好像两朵艳山红，
    不知什么事使她眉开眼笑；
    她忽然一弯腰，
    河水被搅得好像天翻地复。
    当梭磨河逐渐平静，
    她背着水桶走上了山寨的小道。
