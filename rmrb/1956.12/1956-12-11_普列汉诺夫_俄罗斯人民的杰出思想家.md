    Plekhanov - An Outstanding Thinker of the Russian People
    Soviet Professor, Doctor of Philosophy Vera Fomina
    December 11th this year marks the centenary of the birth of Georgi Valentinovich Plekhanov. Plekhanov is one of the outstanding thinkers that Russia has contributed to world culture. He was a great scientist, the pioneer of Russian Marxism, and a well-known Marxist theorist on the international stage.
    Plekhanov was born in the village of Gudalovka in Tambov Province. His father was a retired captain and a small landowner burdened with a large family. His mother was a woman with progressive views, who had a good influence on her son. Plekhanov's childhood was spent in his hometown village. Here, he formed a close relationship with the lives of the people.
    Russia in the early 1860s was at the height of democracy. The Crimean War had just ended. This war not only exposed the decay and incompetence of the autocratic serf system, but also vividly revealed the great patriotic strength of the Russian people.
    After graduating from the Voronezh Military High School with a gold medal, Plekhanov was sent to study at the St. Petersburg Military Engineering School, but a year later (in 1874) he transferred to the St. Petersburg Mining Institute. He studied diligently and eagerly strived to master the achievements of science and culture. Plekhanov began his social revolutionary activities at the Mining Institute.
    In 1876, Plekhanov approached the organization of revolutionary populists. The revolutionary populists were the dominant faction in the Russian liberation movement at that time. It was a time when the democratic upsurge had further developed and the revolutionary situation had matured. The Russo-Turkish War brought many profound disasters to the Russian people, and the dissatisfaction of the broad masses continued to grow: there were peasant disturbances in the countryside; the young Russian revolutionary proletariat held strikes and made revolutions in the cities. The famous "going to the people" era began, and under the influence of the anarchist leader Bakunin, the idea that "Russian peasants have an innate tendency toward communism" was widely popular.
    After joining the populist organization "Land and Freedom Party," Plekhanov twice "went to the people," to the countryside, in order to mobilize the peasants for revolution. He became a recognized and authoritative populist theorist. During these years, he wrote many works, including "The Laws of Economic Development in Russia and the Tasks of Socialism," as well as a large number of leaflets and slogans about the position of the proletariat, calling on the workers of St. Petersburg to organize strikes against exploitation and oppression. Plekhanov used his experience of engaging in activities among the St. Petersburg proletariat for more than three years when writing these leaflets and slogans. At that time, he was a propagandist for workers' groups and an organizer of strikes. Contact with the workers prompted him to turn to Marxism.
    Plekhanov was forced into exile abroad because he was being hunted by detectives; he became a Marxist while living abroad, and he established personal contact with Engels.
    The first Russian Marxist group "Emancipation of Labor," founded and led by Plekhanov, played a major role in spreading Marxist doctrine and developing the Russian revolutionary workers' movement.
    From 1883 to 1903, was the most important and productive period of Plekhanov's creative activity. During these years, in Lenin's words, he contributed outstanding works to the masses, especially those against opportunists, revisionists, and populists.
    Plekhanov's writings "Socialism and Political Struggle," "Our Differences," "On the Development of the Monist View of History," "On the Role of the Individual in History," and "On the Materialist Conception of History" educated an entire generation of Russian Marxists.
    Plekhanov's greatest contribution to the Russian revolutionary movement lies not only in his being a sincere believer in Marxist theory, but also in his transplanting Marxism onto Russian soil. As early as the early 1880s, he called on the Russian working class to stand under the banner of Marxism. Plekhanov believed that the proletariat had enormous revolutionary potential. He pointed out that the modern proletariat is such a class that "can create all the enormous social wealth with its own hands." Plekhanov declared that the Russian proletariat was the leader of the Russian revolutionary movement.
    Plekhanov convincingly stated at the founding congress of the Second International in 1889: "The Russian revolutionary movement can only be victorious if it becomes a workers' revolutionary movement." He also called on advanced Russian revolutionary intellectuals to develop the consciousness of the proletariat and all the Russian people.
    In Russia, Plekhanov was the first to expose the political and theoretical bankruptcy of populism; populism had degenerated into a liberal faction and insisted on the reactionary utopian idea that Russia could avoid capitalism and embark on some "special" path. He resolutely criticized the erroneous view of the populists that the peasant commune was the basis for transforming Russian life according to socialist principles. In his speeches, Plekhanov argued that Russia and Western Europe were following the same historical path, and that Russia had already embarked on the path of capitalism.
    At the same time, Plekhanov brilliantly explained the anti-scientific and reactionary nature of the populist cult of personality. Since the populists were subjectivists and idealists in their understanding of social development, they believed that history was created by "heroes," the so-called "critically thinking people," while the "rabble," the masses of the people, could only blindly follow them. Plekhanov argued with extreme scientific depth that the masses, the people, the classes and their political parties play a great role in social development. It is not heroes, not outstanding individuals, but the masses, the producers of the material means necessary for social survival, who are the true creators of history.
    Plekhanov's "On the Role of the Individual in History" and "On the Development of the Monist View of History" are of particular significance for demonstrating these extremely important principles. In the latter work, he wrote: "As long as there are still such 'heroes' who think that enlightening their own minds is enough to guide the rabble wherever they want, and that they can mold anything they imagine from the rabble, as if from the soil, then the rule of reason remains a beautiful empty phrase, a good dream. Only when the 'rabble' itself becomes the hero of historical action, and when self-consciousness commensurate with this develops in this crude 'rabble,' does the kingdom of reason begin to approach us by leaps and bounds. ... Subjective philosophy seems harmful to us because it prevents intellectuals from promoting the development of this self-consciousness, and opposes the rabble to the heroes, thinking that the rabble is nothing more than a bunch of zeros, whose significance is entirely determined by the ideals of the heroes standing in front of them."
    Plekhanov also explained that Marxism never denies the role of outstanding individuals in history. The significance of great figures and the success of their careers depends only on their correct understanding of the conditions of historical development, maintaining close ties with their class, and correctly reflecting the interests of their class. Under these conditions, outstanding individuals can promote social progress. Plekhanov also emphasized that it is not enough to only clarify the general causes and the laws of social development. "The accidental nature of private life," personal qualities, personal characteristics, and special personal reasons that cannot but be considered, also have some influence on social life.
    In understanding the question of the role of the masses and individuals in history, Plekhanov took a big step forward compared to the Russian revolutionary democrats Belinsky, Herzen, and Chernyshevsky. In Russia, he was the first to call for the establishment of a Marxist party of the working class, and he pointed out that only by uniting the advanced strata of the working class and uniting them into a political party can the entire class and the masses of working people be mobilized to fight against autocracy and serfdom. In this way, Plekhanov's writings against the populists helped the advanced figures in Russia to correctly understand the path of Russian political and economic development.
    Plekhanov played a major role in the struggle against the numerous enemies of Marxism and those who distorted Marxism. His speeches against Proudhon, Stirner's anarchism, French and Italian anarcho-syndicalism, and Millerandism are widely known. Plekhanov's book "Anarchism and Socialism" and a series of articles against anarcho-syndicalism were widely praised by public opinion.
    Plekhanov was one of the first to launch an offensive in the West against West European revisionism and the political opportunism, idealism, and metaphysical views smuggled in by revisionists in the late 1890s. Plekhanov criticized Kuskova and Prokopovich's "Economism," who, in his words, were Russian "loyal followers of Bernstein"; later he opposed Struve, Bulgakov, and others' "Legal Marxism," and also opposed the Socialist-Revolutionaries. A large number of articles written by Plekhanov on important issues of the workers' movement, published in foreign socialist publications and in Russia, helped the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party and the West European socialist parties to recognize the harm that the opportunistic revision of Marxism brought to the cause of socialism.
    It is important to emphasize this, because the leaders of the Second International, such as Kautsky, neglected theory, underestimated the harmfulness of revisionism, and adopted a compromising attitude towards the practice of revising Marxism. Plekhanov fought with unparalleled enthusiasm against the phenomenon of neglecting revolutionary theory within the ranks of the West European socialist parties. Lenin once wrote that he was "the only Marxist in the international social democracy who criticized the extremely vulgar views talked about here by the revisionists from a thorough dialectical materialist viewpoint."
    In those years, Plekhanov was the most prestigious person in the international socialist movement, and his influence was great. He was a genius philosopher who enjoyed world honor.
    Plekhanov defended Marxism as a complete revolutionary doctrine, including all its components, namely economic theory, scientific socialism, dialectical materialism, and historical materialism. The bourgeois elements who opposed Marxism, as well as the revisionists who followed them, tried their best to combine Marxism with liberalism, attempting to reconcile Marxism with Kantianism, socialism with Darwinism, etc. Plekhanov theoretically proved in depth and simply that the several components of Marxism are closely related to each other, so no part of it can be arbitrarily castrated, and no set of views can be arbitrarily extracted from a completely different worldview to replace it, nor can Marxism be combined with idealism.
    Plekhanov spent a great deal of effort to defend and demonstrate Marx's economic theory with genius, especially to popularize the Marxist genius theory of surplus value, and resolutely fought against the vulgar eclecticism and idealist theory of bourgeois political economy.
    The history and theory of socialism occupy a major position in Plekhanov's writings, speeches, and academic papers. Plekhanov waged an indomitable and enthusiastic struggle to defend Marx and Engels' scientific socialism. In his writings, he revealed that scientific socialism is incompatible with the petty-bourgeois utopian socialist system. Plekhanov regarded scientific socialism as the greatest and only philosophical system, saying that the emergence of this system "to the greatest extent marks an important turning point in the entire history of human thought."
    Plekhanov made particularly great contributions to Marxist philosophy (dialectical materialism and historical materialism). Lenin called Plekhanov the socialist who "knows Marxist philosophy best."
    Plekhanov demonstrated and defended the philosophical foundation of Marxism with all his profound knowledge and brilliant polemical genius. His philosophical works, based on rich materials from various scientific fields, including "An Outline of the History of Materialism," "On the Sixtieth Anniversary of Hegel's Death," articles written to oppose Bernstein and Struve, "The Fundamental Questions of Marxism," articles written to oppose Bogdanov and Suriaciakov, etc., all made valuable expositions on the fundamental problems of dialectical materialism. From all aspects, these works are the result of his independent thinking and deep research.
    Plekhanov defended the materialist line in philosophy in the uncompromising struggle against the reactionaries in the philosophical world, and against all kinds of idealism, agnosticism, Kantianism, and positivism. He was one of the most cultivated and insightful scholars of the history of philosophy and the history of sociology.
    In Plekhanov's writings, the problems of historical materialism are fully explained. Historical materialism is the science of the laws of social development established by Marx. Plekhanov exposed the attempt of bourgeois sociologists to obliterate Marx's discovery of historical materialism. Plekhanov said that Marx's discovery caused a series of changes in history and philosophy, just like the revolution completed by Copernicus in astronomy. In his writings on the issue of historical materialism, Plekhanov pointed out that all people's actions, people's views and emotions, and the entire spiritual life of people are ultimately restricted by economic relations and socio-economic structures. He wrote a lot about the role of dialectics in social life, the difference between the laws of nature and social laws, and ridiculed the vulgar sociologists, social Darwinists, and positivists who once dreamed of finding "laws of social physiology." In his writings, Plekhanov proved that explaining social life from a materialist point of view is the key to understanding all political and ideological phenomena, and with this key, the foundation for mankind to engage in purposeful activities to carry out revolutionary transformation of reality can be found.
    Plekhanov has done a lot of work in order to correctly understand the dialectical development of productive forces and relations of production, as well as the role of geographical environment and population in social development. He sharply criticized Malthus' theory and the anti-scientific racial theory. He deeply studied the problems of the occurrence and development of ideological consciousness as a social ideology, and the interaction between social political superstructure and ideological superstructure. In Plekhanov's writings, those chapters that acknowledge the great role of human reason and advanced ideas in social development are particularly outstanding. "You must know that without revolutionary theory, there is no revolutionary movement worthy of the name." Plekhanov wrote in 1883.
    Following Engels's instructions on the need to study the social relations of thought and their impact on social life, Plekhanov wrote many valuable works on the history of human spiritual life, the history of philosophy, the history of social political theory, the history of religion, and the history of Russian social thought.
    Plekhanov developed the foundation of Marxist aesthetics by explaining the broad field of literature and art with Marxist theory. He pointed out that scientific aesthetic theory can only continue to advance by relying on historical materialism.
    In his many years of theoretical activities, Plekhanov did not get rid of serious shortcomings and mistakes. Influenced by West European reformism, Plekhanov did not become a consistent Marxist. Since 1903, Plekhanov turned to the position of Menshevism, and his mistakes became more serious. As the leader of the Mensheviks, Plekhanov waged a struggle against Lenin and the Bolsheviks on the most important principled issues. In 1905, he overestimated the role of the liberal bourgeoisie, denied the leadership of the proletariat in the liberation struggle against the Tsarist system, and underestimated the revolutionary role of the peasant allies of the working class in this struggle. In the years of the First Imperialist War, Plekhanov stood on the social chauvinist position and supported the Tsarist government that was waging the imperialist war.
    After many years of exile, Plekhanov finally returned to Russia in March 1917. But he no longer understood this revolutionary country. Due to years of isolation from actual revolutionary work, he could not discern the complex conditions of the Russian revolution and the characteristics of its development. Plekhanov took a negative attitude towards the Great October Socialist Revolution. Like other leaders of the Second International, he mistakenly believed that it was impossible to carry out a socialist revolution immediately in Russia, because it seemed that Russia lacked the cultural "level" necessary for socialism.
    Lenin relentlessly criticized Plekhanov's political opportunism and his mistakes and hesitation in the fundamental issues of strategy and tactics. But at the same time, Lenin also emphasized that Plekhanov adhered to the cause of justice in philosophy. Lenin said: "...If you do not study (speaking of studying) everything Plekhanov wrote about philosophy, you cannot become a conscious and true communist, because this is the best thing in all of Marxist international literature."
    (Lenin's Complete Works, Russian Edition, Volume 32, page 73)
    Plekhanov wrote excellent works on the history of advanced social thought, literature and art in Russia and the world. He inherited the revolutionary ideological tendencies in Russian social thought in the 19th century, and he was an enthusiastic fighter for the comprehensive development of progressive culture.
    Plekhanov was proud of advanced Russian culture and its revolutionary traditions. From his early youth until his death (May 30, 1918), he was an enthusiastic admirer of the outstanding Russian thinkers and ardent patriots Belinsky, Herzen, Chernyshevsky, and Dobrolyubov. Plekhanov pointed out more than once that Chernyshevsky's writings and personality played a major role in encouraging him to join the ranks of fighters for the cause of the people. In 1908-1912, Plekhanov supported Lenin in the struggle against the liberal bourgeoisie. The liberal bourgeois elements had attempted to subordinate the revolutionary democratic views to the dominant reactionary ideology. In his own writings, he defended his talented old predecessors - the great Russian revolutionary democrats - as a Marxist.
    In Plekhanov's writings on Russian cultural issues, there runs like a red thread the idea that: Tsarist autocracy hindered the true progress of national culture; the working people were deprived of the right to enjoy cultural wealth. He believed that the revolutionary activities of the advanced class were great progressive cultural work, so the cultural level of Russian society should be measured by the degree of popularization of revolutionary ideas among the masses and by the degree of education of the masses.
    Plekhanov believed that literature and art played a major role in the progress of Russian culture. In those years, he regarded literature and art as a force that could consolidate the national pride of the Russian people and their sense of hatred for oppressors at home and abroad. Plekhanov's writings on Leo Tolstoy, Gleb Uspensky, Nekrasov, Pushkin, Gorky, as well as Ibsen and Hamsun, show that he has a deep understanding not only of the lives of the Russian people, but also of the literature and art of various eras and countries.
    The Marxist Plekhanov loved the Russian people, and their glorious history and culture over many centuries. He was a patriot and an irreconcilable opponent of Russian monarchy. Plekhanov was convinced that the Russian revolutionary movement would triumph. He pointed out that the future Russian people would surely play a leading role in the development of Europe and would stand at the forefront of the fighters for freedom, independence, and the progress of the people of all countries in the world.
    As an internationalist and patriot, Plekhanov enthusiastically supported the national liberation struggle of the oppressed people of the world, and fought indomitably and enthusiastically for the victory of the cause of peace and progress.

    普列汉诺夫——俄罗斯人民的杰出思想家
    苏联教授、哲学博士　薇拉·福米娜
    今年12月11日是格奥尔基·瓦连廷诺维奇·普列汉诺夫的诞生一百周年。普列汉诺夫是俄国贡献给世界文化的卓越思想家之一。他是一个大科学家，是俄国马克思主义的先驱者，是国际舞台上鼎鼎大名的马克思主义理论家。
    普列汉诺夫生于唐波夫省的古达洛夫卡村。他的父亲是一个退伍的上尉，也是一个有着大家庭之累的小地主。他的母亲是一个具有先进观点的妇女，她给了儿子以良好的影响。普列汉诺夫的童年是在故乡的村子里度过的。在这里，他同人民的生活结成了亲密的关系。
    十九世纪六十年代初期的俄国处在民主的高潮中。那时刚刚响过克里米亚战争的炮声。这次战争不仅暴露了专制农奴制度的腐朽和无能，而且鲜明地揭示了俄国人民伟大的爱国主义力量。
    普列汉诺夫以获得金质奖章在沃龙?什中等军事学校毕业后，被送到彼得堡陆军士官学校学习，但是一年以后（在1874年）又转到彼得堡矿业学院学习。他在学习中勤勉奋发，如饥似渴地努力掌握科学和文化的成就。普列汉诺夫在矿业学院里开始了他的社会革命活动。
    1876年，普列汉诺夫接近了革命民粹派的组织。革命民粹派在当时俄国解放运动中是一个占统治地位的派别。那时正是民主高潮有了进一步发展，革命形势已经成熟的时期。俄土战争给俄国人民带来了许多深重的灾难，广大群众的不满情绪不断增长：乡村里有农民的风潮；年青的俄国革命无产阶级在城市里举行罢工，闹革命。著名的“到民间去”的年代开始了，当时在无政府主义的领袖巴枯宁的影响下，曾经广泛地流行着这样一种思想，即认为“俄国的农民有天赋的共产主义倾向”。
    普列汉诺夫在加入民粹派的组织“土地和自由党”后，曾经两度“到民间去”，到农村去，为的是发动农民进行革命。他成了公认的有权威的民粹主义理论家。在这些年月里，他写了许多著作，其中有“俄国经济发展规律和社会主义的任务”，还有关于无产阶级所处地位的大批传单、口号，号召彼得堡的工人组织罢工，反对剥削和压迫。普列汉诺夫写这些传单、口号时运用了他在彼得堡无产阶级中间从事三年多活动的经验。当时他是工人小组的宣传员和罢工的组织者。同工人们的交往，促使他转向马克思主义。
    普列汉诺夫因受警探的追缉而被迫流亡国外；他是在侨居国外的时候成了马克思主义者的，他同恩格斯建立过个人的联系。
    由普列汉诺夫创立并领导的第一个俄国马克思主义团体“劳动解放社”，对于传播马克思主义学说，发展俄国革命的工人运动，起了重大的作用。
    从1883年到1903年，是普列汉诺夫从事创造性活动中最重要而且最有成效的时期。在这些年代里，用列宁的话来说，就是他为群众贡献了卓越的著作，特别是那些反对机会主义者、修正派、民粹派的著作。
    普列汉诺夫的著作“社会主义和政治斗争”、“我们的意见分歧”、“论一元史观的发展问题”、“论个人在历史上的作用”、“论唯物史观”，教育了整整一代的俄国马克思主义者。
    普列汉诺夫对俄国革命运动所作的最伟大的功绩不仅在于他是马克思理论的诚笃的信仰者，而且在于他把马克思主义移植在俄国的土壤上。十九世纪八十年代初期，他就号召俄国工人阶级站到马克思主义的旗帜下。普列汉诺夫相信无产阶级有巨大的革命潜力。他指出，现代无产阶级是这样的阶级，“凭它的一双手就可以创造出一切巨大的社会财富”。普列汉诺夫宣布俄国无产阶级是俄国革命运动的领导者。
    普列汉诺夫在1889年第二国际成立大会上令人信服地说道：“俄国的革命运动只有成为工人的革命运动才能获得胜利。”他还号召先进的俄国革命知识分子发展无产阶级和全体俄国人民的自觉。
    在俄国，普列汉诺夫第一个揭发了民粹主义在政治和理论上的破产；民粹主义已蜕化为自由主义的流派，并坚持那种认为俄国可以避免资本主义而走上某种“特殊”道路的反动空想的主张。他坚决批判了民粹派的错误观点，即认为农民村社是以社会主义原理改造俄国生活的基础。普列汉诺夫在其言论中认为俄国和西欧走着相同的历史道路，俄国已经走上了资本主义道路。
    同时，普列汉诺夫还出色地说明了民粹主义个人崇拜的反科学性和反动性。民粹派在对社会发展的理解上既然是主观主义者和唯心主义者，他们便认为历史是“英雄”，即所谓“批判地思惟的人”创造的，而“群氓”即人民群众仿佛只能盲目地跟着他们走。普列汉诺夫以极其深刻的科学性论证了群众，人民，阶级及其政党在社会发展中的伟大作用。不是英雄，不是杰出的个人，而是群众，是社会生存所必需的物质资料的生产者，才是历史的真正创造者。
    普列汉诺夫著的“论个人在历史上的作用”、“论一元史观的发展问题”，对于论证这些极重要的原理有特殊的意义。他在后一著作中写道：“只要还有这么一种‘英雄’，以为只要启发自己本身的头脑就足以随心所欲地引导群氓到任何地方去，就足以从群氓中，如同从泥土中一样，塑造出他们所臆想到的一切东西，在这样的时候，理性的统治就仍然是漂亮的空话，善良的梦想。只有当‘群氓’本身成为历史行动的英雄，并在这个粗野的‘群氓’中发展着与此相适应的自觉的时候，理性的王国才开始大踏步地走近我们。……主观哲学在我们看来是有害的，其原因就在于：它妨碍知识分子去促进这个自我意识的发展，而把群氓同英雄对立起来，以为群氓不过是一大堆零，其意义完全以站在它们前头的英雄的理想为转移。”
    普列汉诺夫就此还解释说，马克思主义决不否认杰出的个人在历史上的作用。伟大人物的意义和他事业的成功，只是决定于他正确地理解历史发展的条件，同自己的阶级保持密切联系，并正确地反映本阶级的利益。在这种条件下，杰出的个人能够促进社会向前发展。普列汉诺夫还强调地指出，只限于弄清一般原因和社会发展的规律性是不够的。“私生活的偶然性”、个人的品质、个人的性格特点，以及不能不予以考虑的特殊的个人原因，在某种程度上对社会生活也有影响。
    在理解群众和个人在历史上作用的问题，普列汉诺夫比俄国革命民主主义者别林斯基、赫尔岑和车尔尼雪夫斯基前进了一大步。在俄国，他第一个号召建立工人阶级的马克思主义政党，他指出只有把工人阶级的先进阶层联合起来，团结为一个政党，才能发动整个阶级和劳动人民群众去进行反对专制和农奴制度的斗争。就是这样，普列汉诺夫为反对民粹派而写的著作，帮助俄国的先进人物正确地理解了俄国政治经济发展的道路。
    普列汉诺夫在反对为数众多的马克思主义的敌人和歪曲马克思主义者的斗争中，起了重大的作用。他的反对蒲鲁东、施蒂纳的无政府主义、法国和意大利无政府工团主义、米勒兰主义的言论是广为驰名的。普列汉诺夫所著的“无政府主义和社会主义”一书以及反对无政府工团主义的一批论文，受到舆论的普遍赞许。
    普列汉诺夫是九十年代末期在西方对西欧修正主义以及修正派所偷运的政治机会主义、唯心主义和形而上学观点首先发起攻势者之一。普列汉诺夫批判了枯斯科娃和普罗科坡维奇的“经济主义”，用他的话来说，他们是俄国的“伯恩施坦的忠实信徒”；以后他又反对司徒卢威、布尔加可夫等人的“合法马克思主义”，还反对了社会革命党人。在国外社会主义刊物上和在俄国发表的、普列汉诺夫所写有关工人运动重要问题的大批论文，帮助俄国社会民主工党和西欧社会党认清了对马克思主义所作的机会主义修正给社会主义事业所带来的危害。
    强调这一点是很重要的，因为第二国际的领袖考茨基等人漠视理论，对于修正主义的危害性估计不足，对于修正马克思主义的作法抱着妥协的态度。普列汉诺夫以无比的热情同西欧社会党队伍内轻视革命理论的现象进行斗争。列宁曾经这样写道：他是“国际社会民主派中唯一从彻底辩证唯物主义观点出发，批判修正主义者在这里大谈特谈的异常庸俗见解的马克思主义者。”
    在那些年月里，普列汉诺夫是国际社会主义运动中最有声望的人，他的影响很大。他是享有世界荣誉的天才哲学家。
    普列汉诺夫把马克思主义作为一个完整的革命学说来加以保卫，包括它的一切组成部分，即经济学说、科学社会主义、辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。反对马克思主义的资产阶级分子以及追随他们的修正主义者，极力想把马克思主义同自由主义结合起来，企图把马克思主义同康德主义，把社会主义同达尔文主义调和起来，等等。普列汉诺夫深入浅出地从理论上证明，马克思主义的几个组成部分彼此之间有极密切的联系，因此决不能任意阉割其中任何一部分，不能随便从完全不同的另一种世界观中抽取一套观点来代替它，也不能把马克思主义同唯心主义结合在一起。
    普列汉诺夫花了很大的力量，天才地捍卫并论证了马克思的经济学说，特别是把马克思主义关于剩余价值的天才学说加以通俗化，坚决地同资产阶级政治经济学的庸俗的折衷主义和唯心主义理论作斗争。
    社会主义的历史和理论，在普列汉诺夫的著作、讲演和学术论文中占有重大的位置。普列汉诺夫为维护马克思和恩格斯的科学社会主义进行了不屈不挠的热情的斗争。他在自己的著作中揭示了科学社会主义同小资产阶级空想社会主义制度决不相容。普列汉诺夫把科学社会主义看作是最伟大的唯一的哲学体系，他说，这一体系的出现“在最大程度上标志着整个人类思想史上的重要转变”。
    普列汉诺夫在马克思主义哲学（辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义）方面所作的贡献特别大。列宁称普列汉诺夫为“最通晓马克思主义哲学”的社会主义者。
    普列汉诺夫以其全部渊博的学识、辉煌的论战天才，论证和保卫了马克思主义的哲学基础。他的那些以各种科学部门的丰富材料为基础的哲学著作，其中包括“唯物主义历史概论”、“论黑格尔逝世六十周年”、为反对伯恩施坦和司徒卢威而写的论文、“马克思主义的根本问题”、为反对波格丹诺夫和苏里亚齐科夫而写的论文等等，都对辩证唯物主义的根本问题作了宝贵的阐述。从各方面看来，这些著作是他独立思考和深刻钻研的结果。
    普列汉诺夫在同哲学界的反动派，同形形色色的唯心主义、不可知论、康德主义、实证主义作不妥协的斗争中，捍卫了哲学中的唯物主义路线。他是修养最深，具有深刻见解的哲学史和社会学史学者之一。
    在普列汉诺夫的著作中，全面地阐明了历史唯物主义的问题。历史唯物主义是马克思创立的关于社会发展规律的科学。普列汉诺夫揭穿了资产阶级社会学家抹煞马克思发现唯物史观的企图。普列汉诺夫说，马克思的这一发现，在历史学和哲学中引起了一系列的变革，如同哥白尼在天文学中完成的变革一样。普列汉诺夫在关于唯物史观问题的著作中指出，人们的一切行动，人们的观点和情绪，人们的全部精神生活，归根到底要受经济关系、社会经济结构所制约。他写了很多著作谈辩证法在社会生活中的作用，谈自然界规律和社会规律的差异，并且嘲笑了那些曾经梦想找到“社会生理学规律”的庸俗社会学者、社会达尔文主义者和实证主义者。普列汉诺夫在其著作中证明了：以唯物主义观点解释社会生活，就是认识一切政治和思想现象的钥匙，有了这把钥匙就可以找到人类为对现实进行革命改造而从事有目的的活动的基础。
    为了正确地理解生产力和生产关系的辩证发展，以及地理环境和人口在社会发展中的作用，普列汉诺夫做了很多工作。他尖锐地批判了马尔萨斯的理论和反科学的种族论。他深刻地钻研了作为一种社会意识形态的思想意识的发生和发展问题，以及社会政治上层建筑和思想上层建筑的相互作用问题。在普列汉诺夫的著作中，那些承认人类理性、先进思想在社会发展中有极伟大作用的篇章，是异常出色的。“要知道，没有革命理论，就没有名副其实的革命运动。”——普列汉诺夫在1883年这样写道。
    普列汉诺夫遵循着恩格斯关于必须研究思想社会关系及其对社会生活的影响的指示，写出了许多有关人类精神生活史，哲学史，社会政治学说史，宗教史以及俄国社会思想史方面有价值的著作。
    普列汉诺夫以马克思主义理论阐明文学和艺术这一广阔的领域，因而发展了马克思主义美学的基础。他指出，科学的美学理论只有依靠唯物史观才能不断前进。
    普列汉诺夫在其多年的理论活动中，没有摆脱严重的缺点和错误。普列汉诺夫因受西欧改良主义的影响，没有成为一个贯彻始终的马克思主义者。自从1903年以后，普列汉诺夫转到孟什维克主义立场，他的错误更加严重了。普列汉诺夫作为孟什维克的领袖，在最重要的原则问题上进行过反对列宁和布尔什维克的斗争。1905年他过高地估计了自由资产阶级的作用，否认无产阶级在反对沙皇制度的解放斗争中的领导权，对工人阶级同盟军农民在这一斗争中的革命作用也估计不足。在第一次帝国主义大战的年月里，普列汉诺夫站在社会沙文主义立场，支持过进行帝国主义战争的沙皇政府。
    经过多年流亡之后，普列汉诺夫终于在1917年3月返回俄国。但是他已不了解这个革命的国家，由于多年同实际革命事业隔绝，他不能辨明俄国革命所处的复杂条件及其发展的特点。普列汉诺夫对伟大十月社会主义革命抱着否定的态度。正如第二国际的其他领袖一样，他错误地认为在俄国即刻进行社会主义革命是不可能的，因为仿佛俄国缺乏社会主义所必需的文化“水平”。
    列宁毫不留情地批判了普列汉诺夫的政治机会主义以及在战略、策略根本问题上的错误和彷徨迷途。但同时列宁还强调指出，普列汉诺夫在哲学中坚持了正义的事业。列宁说：“……如果不研究（说的是研究）普列汉诺夫关于哲学所写的一切，就不能成为自觉的真正的共产主义者，因为这是全部马克思主义的国际文献中最好的东西。”

    普列汉诺夫撰写了有关俄国和世界先进社会思想史、文学艺术方面的卓越著作。他继承了十九世纪俄国社会思想中革命的思想倾向，他是一个为全面发展进步文化而斗争的热情战士。
    普列汉诺夫以先进的俄国文化及其革命传统而感到自豪。他从早期青年时代起直到逝世止（1918年5月30日），一直是卓越的俄国思想家和火热的爱国主义者别林斯基、赫尔岑、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫的热心崇拜者。普列汉诺夫不止一次地指出，车尔尼雪夫斯基的著作和为人，对于他转入为人民事业而奋斗的战士行列起了重大鼓舞作用。在1908—1912年，普列汉诺夫支持列宁进行反对自由资产阶级的斗争。自由资产阶级分子曾企图使革命民主主义观点屈从于占统治的反动思想。他在自己所写的著作中作为一个马克思主义者保卫了自己的天才的老前辈——伟大的俄国革命民主主义者。
    在普列汉诺夫有关俄国文化问题的著作中，像一根红线一般贯穿着这样一种思想，即：沙皇专制阻碍着民族文化的真正进步；劳动人民被剥夺了享受文化财富的权利。他认为先进阶级的革命活动是伟大的进步的文化工作，因此俄国社会的文化水准，应当以革命思想在人民大众中间普及的程度，以人民大众的教养程度来衡量。
    普列汉诺夫认为文学艺术在俄国文化进步中起着重大的作用。在那些年月里，他把文学艺术看成能够巩固俄国人民民族自豪感和对国内外压迫者的仇视感的力量。普列汉诺夫所写的关于列夫·托尔斯泰、戈列布·乌斯宾斯基、?克拉索夫、普希金、高尔基以及易卜生、哈姆生的著作，说明他不仅对俄国人民的生活，而且对各种时代各国人民的文学艺术有着深刻的了解。
    马克思主义者普列汉诺夫热爱俄国人民，及其许多世纪以来的光荣历史和文化。他是一个爱国主义者，是俄国君主专制的不可调和的对头。普列汉诺夫确信俄国革命运动会胜利，他指出未来俄国人民一定会在欧洲的发展中起主导的作用，并将站在为争取自由、独立，争取世界各国人民进步的战士的最前列。
    普列汉诺夫作为国际主义者和爱国主义者，热心拥护世界被压迫人民的民族解放斗争，不屈不挠热情洋溢地为和平和进步事业的胜利而斗争。
