Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, December 24th: The second level adit project, a key project in the second phase of expansion of the Longyan Iron Mine, has recently officially begun construction. After the completion of this adit, which is twenty-two li in length, and its entry into production, it will fundamentally change the production outlook of the Longyan Iron Mine, increasing ore output by one and a half times compared to this year.

The fact that transportation has lagged behind production has always been the most serious problem for the Longyan Iron Mine. Tens of millions of tons of ore have to be hoisted from the hundreds of meters deep underground using winches or manual labor. After the second level adit is built, underground transportation will be completely mechanized, and the mined ore can be loaded onto electric cars and directly sent to the new crushing and screening plant that will be built.

    尤烟铁矿开凿第二平峒
    据新华社保定24日电　龙烟铁矿第二期扩建工程中的重点工程——第二平峒工程，在最近正式施工。这个全长二十二华里的平峒完工投入生产以后，将从根本上改变龙烟铁矿的生产面貌，使矿砂产量比今年提高一倍半。
    运输落后于生产，一直是龙烟铁矿最严重的问题。千万吨的矿砂，都要用绞车或人工从几百公尺深的井下提升上来。第二平峒修好以后，坑下运输就将全部机械化，开采出的矿砂装上电车，就可以直接送到将要新建的破碎筛选厂去。
