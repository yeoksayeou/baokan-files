    Waste Must Be Opposed in Schools
    Some students at Peking University drop a lot of rice grains and broken steamed buns on the tables and the floor while eating. Some students even dump entire steamed buns or bowls of rice into the sewage. According to statistics, the grain dropped on the ground and tables, and left in the bowls by students in the student cafeteria every day, amounts to more than fifty jin when collected. During festivals, the phenomenon of wasting grain is even more prominent.
    In addition, not cherishing public property is also a common phenomenon. During weekend dances, many tables and glass are often broken due to crowding. Almost every dance results in the damage of twenty or more tables, amounting to hundreds of tables damaged per month. The same is true for the cafeteria's furniture. According to statistics from the Peking University Communist Youth League Committee, more than twenty enamel plates are lost every day in one small cafeteria, amounting to more than six hundred lost per month, worth more than 300 yuan.
    Some students do not cherish their own clothes and leave them outside. Hundreds of pieces of clothing are discarded on the ground around the dormitories for a long time, rotting away in vain. On October 23rd alone, ninety-six pieces of clothing were found discarded on the ground behind the student dormitories. As a member of Peking University, I have personally witnessed these phenomena, which are completely incompatible with the current advocacy of hard work and plain living in our country. These serious phenomena of waste should immediately attract the attention of the relevant departments.　Hong Yun

    学校里要反对浪费
    北京大学有些学生吃饭时，在饭桌上、脚下丢了很多饭粒和碎馒头，也有的学生将整个馒头、整碗米饭倒在污水里。据统计，学生食堂每天吃饭时掉在地上、桌上、遗留在碗里的粮食，集中起来就有五十斤以上。每逢节日，浪费粮食的现象就更突出。
    另外，不爱护公共财物也是普遍的现象。周末举行舞会，桌子和玻璃往往被挤坏不少，几乎每次晚会都要损坏二十几张桌子，一个月就有成百张的桌子损坏了。食堂的家具也是如此。据北京大学团委会统计，在一个小食堂里，每天要遗失搪磁碟子二十多只，每月要遗失六百多只左右，价值三百多元。
    有的学生不爱惜自己的衣物，把衣物放在外面。宿舍周围有好几百件衣服丢在地上长期无人要，白白地烂掉。10月23日一天，在学生宿舍后面就发现有九十六件衣服丢在地上。我是北京大学的一员，我亲眼看到的这些现象，是与当前我国提倡艰苦朴素的作风完全不相符的。这些严重的浪费现象，应该立即引起有关方面的重视。　洪运
