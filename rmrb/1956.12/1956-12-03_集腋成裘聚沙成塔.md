Xinhua News Agency, 29th:
    120,000 Tons of Coal
    By November 20th this year, train drivers and stokers across the country had saved nearly 120,000 tons of coal.
    Excellent drivers and stokers have come up with various ways to save fuel. In the past, locomotives only cleared ash at water stations. This year, Li Naishun, a deputy driver from the Jinan Railway Administration, discovered that if ash wasn't cleared mid-journey, the accumulated ash would affect ventilation inside the furnace and reduce the heat of coal combustion. Therefore, he cleared the accumulated ash mid-journey instead of waiting for the water station. Li Yantao from the Jinzhou Railway Administration also created experience in saving coal in extremely cold and steep areas.
    The coal-saving experiences of nationally renowned advanced producers Li Shaoqiang and Sun Shigui have been widely promoted this year. The characteristic of Li Shaoqiang's experience is the ability to fully utilize the inertia of the train's movement to save fuel. The characteristic of Sun Shigui's rapid fire-starting method is that the coal feeding action is fast and accurate, which can shorten the time the furnace door is open, so that less cold air rushes into the furnace, and the coal can be fully burned.
    Because train drivers and stokers have saved a lot of fuel for the country, 50%–60% of drivers and stokers nationwide have received bonuses this year.
    More Than 4,000 Tons of Petroleum
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th: Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai's transportation and industrial sectors have saved more than 4,000 tons of petroleum.
    In terms of transportation, two bus depots in Shanghai fully promoted the advanced experience of safe gliding; the grain bureau's receiving and dispatching station installed water-spraying fuel-saving devices on its vehicles; Shanghai Transport Company and other units also generally adopted the Soviet advanced management system of "quota-based material requisition." In production, Housheng Rubber Factory, Zhentai Rubber Factory, and others that require gasoline have installed various gasoline sealing and recovery equipment; Shanghai Petroleum Company also helped more than 70 rubber product production departments with the highest oil consumption to continuously improve technical measures for saving gasoline.
    Starting in the second half of this year, more than 40 industrial production sectors in Shanghai, such as steel, fine steel, and oil, have modified some oil boilers and adopted cracked heavy fuel oil, which is called "waste," to replace expensive light diesel oil, which has also saved a lot of petroleum.
    More Than 7 Million Yuan in Construction Funds
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 29th: The Hubei Provincial People's Committee strictly controlled the budget, enabling its seven departments and bureaus to save more than 7 million yuan in construction funds for the country this year. More than 5 million yuan was saved through tapping potential and reducing non-productive expenditures; the rest was mobilized from internal resources and reduced from overvalued project costs.
    As early as March of this year, the Hubei Provincial People's Committee instructed relevant financial authorities to deduct about 10% of the savings from the budget appropriations for various capital construction projects. However, many departments and bureaus and construction units did not take effective saving measures; some units, although deducting the saved funds, constantly added to the budget. In order to change this situation, the Provincial People's Committee, in addition to instructing relevant units to check savings work from July to October, also organized inspection teams to go deep into three key units for inspection. The results of the inspection proved that, on the basis of ensuring the quality of the project, a lot of funds can still be saved. For example, after careful research by technicians, the Provincial Inland Water Transport Bureau adopted measures such as obtaining materials locally to reduce timber transportation costs and improving efficiency and saving materials. The cost of building only fourteen wooden barges can save more than 100,000 yuan compared with the planned cost.
    More Than 3,000 Freight Cars
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 29th: Due to the increase in freight car loading capacity, the Chengdu-Chongqing, Baoji-Chengdu, and Qijiang railways under the jurisdiction of the Chongqing Railway Administration saved 3,286 railcars for the country from January to October this year.
    This year, the Chongqing Railway Administration successively organized full-loading groups with the participation of consigning units at more than a dozen stations, including Chongqing, Chengdu, Mianyang, Guangyuan, Jianyang, and Tongguanyi. Jianyang Station improved the methods of cotton packaging and loading, enabling railcars that could only load 20 tons of cotton due to their large volume to load 30 tons. Tongguanyi Station created a new method of loading coke, enabling a railcar to load 5 tons more coke.
    This year, key stations under the Chongqing Railway Administration also promoted advanced experiences such as the double-layer loading of live pigs, the symmetrical ridge-loading of wood, and the mixed loading of light and heavy goods. The double-layer loading of live pigs and the mixed loading of light and heavy goods alone can save more than 2,200 railcars throughout the year.
    140,000 Jin of Cement
    Xinhua News Agency, Mang'ai, 29th: The Youquanzi exploration area in the Qaidam Basin adopted the Soviet advanced experience of "cementing with sand mixed in cement," saving 140,000 jin of cement. The quality of the cementing work fully meets the standards.
    Generally, after completing an oil exploration well, a steel casing needs to be added to the wellbore, and cement is poured on the outside of the casing to solidify the well wall. The cement used to solidify the well walls in the Qaidam Basin must be transported from the interior, which is not only very costly but also requires a large amount. After adopting the cementing with sand mixed in cement method, each ton of cementing cement can be mixed with 20% sand, with the highest mixing reaching 30%. This not only saves cement but also reduces drilling costs.
    More Than 2.4 Million Jin of Wheat
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 2nd: The employees of six local state-owned and joint state-private flour mills in Xi'an saved more than 2.4 million jin of wheat in the first ten months of this year.
    Since February this year, these six flour mills have launched a socialist competition centered on "increasing the flour extraction rate and output, and reducing coal and electricity consumption on the basis of improving flour quality." In the competition, each factory vigorously promoted advanced experiences. After the Xi'an People's Flour Mill promoted the advanced experience of "middle road bran brushing," the flour produced per hour increased from 450 bags to 480 bags, with a maximum of over 500 bags, creating the highest record since the factory was opened. Each factory paid attention to organizing employees to put forward rationalization proposals to solve key production problems. Yan Zheng, an engineer at Huafeng Flour Mill, and Chang Hanzhuo, a technician, jointly researched and proposed the cancellation of the flattening mill, which improved the flour extraction ratio and produced more than 3,800 bags of flour for the country.
    In the competition, the factories also visited each other to learn and exchange experiences, which greatly helped to increase flour production. (Attached picture)
    When the open-air prefabrication plant of the First Tractor Factory prefabricated large concrete components, it adopted methods such as rapid demolding, dry-hard concrete, and the use of cement activity, saving more than 300 cubic meters of wood and 125 tons of cement from January to October this year.

    集腋成裘聚沙成塔
    十二万吨煤
    据新华社29日讯　今年到11月20日，全国的火车司机和司炉已经节约了将近十二万吨燃煤。
    优秀的司机和司炉们想出多种多样的办法来节约燃料。过去火车头都要到上水站才清除炉灰。今年济南铁路管理局副司机李乃顺发现中途不清炉灰，积存的炉灰太多就会影响炉内通风，减少煤的燃烧热力。所以他不等到上水站，中途就把积存的炉灰清出去。锦州铁路管理局的李彦涛也创造了在严寒和坡度大的地区省煤的经验。
    全国著名先进生产者李绍强和孙士贵的省煤经验今年都已经普遍推广。李绍强经验的特点是能够充分利用列车行走的堕力节省燃料。孙士贵的快速焚火法的特点是，投煤的动作又快又准，能够使炉门开的时间很短，这样跑进火炉里的冷空气少一些，煤就可以充分燃烧。
    由于火车司机司炉们为国家节省了大量燃料，今年全国已经有50％—60％的司机、司炉获得了奖金。
    四千多吨石油
    据新华社上海29日电　上海各运输、工业部门今年以来已经节省了四千多吨石油。
    在交通运输方面，上海市公共汽车两个车场全面推广了安全滑行的先进经验；粮食局接运站的汽车装上了喷水节油器；上海市运输公司等单位还普遍采用了苏联“限额领料”的先进管理制度。在生产中需要汽油的厚生橡胶厂、正泰橡胶厂等都装置了各种汽油的密封和回收设备；上海石油公司还帮助用油最多的七十多个橡胶品生产部门不断改进节省汽油的技术措施。
    从今年下半年开始，上海四十多个钢铁、钢精、油脂等工业生产部门改装了一些油锅炉，采用了被称为“废料”的裂化重燃料油来代替价格昂贵的轻柴油，也节省了大量石油。
    七百多万元建设资金
    据新华社武汉29日电　湖北省人民委员会严格控制预算，使所属七个厅、局，在今年工程建设中为国家节省了七百多万元的资金。其中五百多万元是通过挖掘潜力和减少非生产性开支节约下来的；其余的是动员内部资源和削减高估工程费用部分。
    早在今年3月，湖北省人民委员会就指示有关财务机关从各项基建工程预算拨款中，扣除10％左右的节约额。但是不少厅局和工程单位没有采取有效的节约措施；有的单位虽然扣除了节约的款项，却又不断追加预算。为了改变这种情况，省人民委员会除在7月到10月先后责成有关单位检查节约工作以外，又组织检查组深入三个重点单位进行检查。检查结果证明，在保证工程质量的基础上，仍然可以节约很多资金。如省内河航运局经过技术人员的仔细研究，采取就地取材减少木材运费以及提高效率、节省材料等措施，仅十四艘木囤船的造价就可以比计划成本节约十万多元。
    三千多辆货车
    据新华社重庆29日电　重庆铁路管理局所辖成渝、宝成、綦江三铁路由于提高货车装载量，今年1月到10月为国家节约了三千二百八十六辆车皮。
    重庆铁路管理局今年先后在重庆、成都、绵阳、广元、简阳、铜罐驿等十多个车站组织了有托运单位参加的满载小组。简阳车站改进了棉花的包扎、装车方法，使原来因体积大只能装载二十吨棉花的车皮，能够装三十吨。铜罐驿车站创造了新的装焦炭的方法，使一辆车能多装五吨焦炭。
    重庆铁路管理局各重点车站今年还推广了生猪双层装车法、木材对装起脊装车法和轻重配装法等先进经验。仅双层装生猪和轻重搭配装车，全年便可以节约二千二百多辆车皮。
    十四万斤水泥
    据新华社茫崖29日电　柴达木盆地油泉子探区采用苏联“固井水泥掺砂”的先进经验，节约了十四万斤水泥，固井工作的质量完全合乎标准。
    一般石油探井在钻完以后，需要在井筒里加一钢铸的套管，在套管外面浇灌上水泥，使井壁巩固起来。柴达木盆地使用的巩固井壁的水泥，都要从内地运进，不但成本很高，需要量也很大。采用固井水泥掺砂法以后，每吨固井的水泥可以掺砂20％，最高的掺砂30％，不但节约水泥，而且可以降低钻井成本。
    二百四十多万斤小麦
    据新华社西安2日电　西安市六个地方国营公私合营面粉厂的职工，在今年头十个月中节约了二百四十多万斤小麦。
    从今年二月以来，这六个面粉厂都展开了以
  “在提高面粉质量的基础上提高出粉率和产量，降低煤耗、电耗”为中心内容的社会主义竞赛。在竞赛中，各工厂都大力推广了先进经验。西安市人民面粉厂推广了“中路刷麸”的先进经验以后，每小时产的面粉由四百五十袋提高到四百八十袋，最高达到五百袋以上，创造了开厂以来最高纪录。各厂都注意组织职工提出解决生产关键问题的合理化建议。华峰面粉厂工程师严正和技师常汉倬共同研究提出取消压扁磨的建议，提高了出粉比例，为国家多生产出三千八百多袋面粉。
    在竞赛中，各厂还互相参观学习，交流经验，对提高面粉产量有很大帮助。（附图片）
    第一拖拉机厂的露天预制厂预先制造混凝土大型构件的时候，采用了快速脱模、干硬性混凝土、利用水泥活性等办法，自今年1月到10月共节省三百多立方公尺木材和一百二十五吨水泥。
