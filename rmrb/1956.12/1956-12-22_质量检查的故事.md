    The Story of Quality Inspection
  　Zhao Decheng
    After the Shenyang Dadong Lumber Mill became a joint state-private enterprise, Qu Yongchun, a member of the private sector, was assigned to be a quality inspector.

    Qu Yongchun felt both happy and apprehensive when he took on his new job. He was happy that he had become an employee of a joint state-private factory, with a promising future and something to strive for. He was apprehensive because the quality inspector had to deal with the workers. As a member of the private sector, would the workers listen to him? Would the workers look down on him? In the end, he resolved to work hard and improve himself, not to let the government down. However, he had to be careful in everything he did, avoid showing off, and seek no merit, only to avoid making mistakes. Therefore, he kept everything in sight and in mind, never spoke at length. When someone asked him a question, he never gave two answers.

    One day, he went to the workshop to inspect the quality and found that the materials produced by Saw No. 3 were all "big head, small tail," which did not meet the quality standards. Logically speaking, production should be stopped immediately to check the cause. It seemed he couldn't avoid speaking up. But just as the words reached his lips, he held them back. He thought: stopping production for a minute would affect the workers' income, would the workers agree? If I said the quality was bad and the saw had a problem, wouldn't it be useless if the workers didn't listen? Besides, stopping production would affect production, and he couldn't bear the responsibility if the plan wasn't completed. The poor quality could be repaired later. He forced himself not to look at the production of Saw No. 3 and tried to leave the workshop quickly. Just as he reached the door, he couldn't help but glance at Saw No. 3. "Oh!" he couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. In less than ten minutes, Saw No. 3 had produced another pile of wood. The loss would be so serious! His heart felt like it was being grabbed by an eagle. He dragged his heavy steps and measured several pieces of freshly sawn wood, still "big head, small tail," not meeting the quality standards. "There must be something wrong with the saw," he decided to stop production. But as soon as he moved, he stopped again. "If the workers don't listen, and the public representative doesn't support me, how will I face people in the future?" Vanity made him retreat again. "Now it's such a big lumber mill, different from my previous private factory. What does a little waste matter? It's just a hair off a bull…." Thinking, thinking, he retreated from the workshop again.

    Even though he left the workshop, he couldn't stop thinking about the things in the workshop. Contradictions repeatedly assaulted him, and the ideological struggle became more intense. "Whether it's the state's or the individual's, it's a pity to waste good materials." He paused, muttering to himself, "Putting myself in their shoes, if it were my private business, I would have stopped the saw for repairs long ago. Now, can I let the state's property be wasted?" "The question before me is, should I consider my personal face, or should I be responsible for the state's property?" "No, no, I must not let the state's property be lost." He hardened his heart and ran to find the workshop director.

    After listening to his report, the workshop director immediately ran to the workshop to check the quality, immediately accepted his opinion, and ordered Saw No. 3 to stop production.

    When the factory heard that Saw No. 3 had stopped production, the factory director ran in, sweating profusely, and asked, "Who ordered the shutdown? Why was production stopped?" Qu Yongchun's heart pounded. "Oh no, I'm going to be criticized this time…." Unexpectedly, after the factory director listened to the workshop director's report and personally checked the quality of the products, he immediately walked to Qu Yongchun's side, patted him on the shoulder, and said kindly, "Comrade Qu, you did the right thing. I support your opinion…." Qu Yongchun's heart was about to jump out of his chest with joy. He had only heard that members of the private sector had positions and power and should boldly use their talents. Today, he truly understood the meaning of this sentence. He didn't expect his opinion to be valued and supported by the factory director and the workshop director. He was filled with gratitude and stood there motionless. With a clang, the workers had disassembled Saw No. 3. As if someone had pushed him, he ran over like a whirlwind, climbed onto the saw platform, and began to repair Saw No. 3 with the workers.

    质量检查的故事
  　赵德成
    沈阳大东制材厂公私合营了，私方人员曲永春被安排当质量检查员。
    曲永春走上新的工作岗位以后，心里又高兴又恐慌。高兴的是自己成为公私合营工厂的职员，有了前途、有了奔头；恐慌的是质量检查员要和工人打交道，自己是私方人员，说话工人听吗？工人是不是瞧得起自己？最后，他下定决心，要在工作中好好干，锻炼自己，不辜负政府对自己的信任；不过事事还得小心，别出风头，不求有功，只求无过。因此他凡事都看在眼里，记在心里，不说长不道短，别人问他一句，他从不答两句。
    一天，他到车间去检查质量，发现三号锯生产的材料都是“大头小尾”，不合质量标准。照理说，遇到这样的事应当马上停止生产，检查原因，看样子不说话是不行了。可是话刚到了嘴边，他马上又留住了。他想：停产一分钟，就要影响工人的收入，工人会同意吗？我说质量不好，锯有毛病，工人不听还不是白搭。再说要停产，影响了生产，计划完不成，这个责任自己更负不起。质量差，以后进行返修就行了。他强制自己不再去看三号锯的生产情况，想迅速地离开车间。刚走到门口，他不由自主地望了三号锯一眼，“呀”的一声，他不禁吃了一惊，就在还不到十分钟的时间，三号锯又生产了那一大堆木材。这样下去，损失是多么严重啊！他的心像被老鹰抓住了。他拖着沉重的脚步，又去量了量几块刚锯下木材，仍然是“大头小尾”，不合质量标准。“一定是锯有了毛病”，他决定停止生产；可是刚动身，又停住了。“如果工人不听，公方代表不支持，自己今后怎样见人呢？”虚荣心又使他退后了。“现在这么大个制材厂，不同于先前自己的私营厂子了，浪费点算啥，还不是牛身上的一根毛……。”想着、想着，他又退出了车间。
    人退出了车间，心还是念念不忘车间里的事。矛盾一再的侵袭着他，思想斗争更加激烈了。“不管是国家的还是个人的，好好的材料浪费了总是可惜。”他停了停，心里在叨咕着，“将心比心，如果是自己私营的时候，早就停锯修理了；现在，难道能让国家的财产浪费掉吗？”“摆在面前的问题，是顾及个人的面子呢？还是为国家的财产负责呢？”“不，不，决不能让国家的财产受损失。”他狠了狠心，就跑去找车间主任去了。
    车间主任听完了他的报告，立刻就跑到车间去检查了一下质量，马上接受了他的意见，命令三号锯停产。
    厂部听到三号锯停产了，厂长跑得满头大汗，一进车间就问：“谁叫停产的？为什么停产？”曲永春的心砰砰地跳起来了。“糟了，这回一定要挨批评了……。”想不到厂长听完车间主任的报告，又亲自检查了产品的质量，当即走向曲永春的身边，拍着他的肩膀和蔼地说：“曲同志，你做得对，我支持你的意见。……”曲永春的心简直高兴得要跳出来了。他过去只听说，私方人员有职有权，要大胆地发挥自己的才能。今天才确实体会到这句话的意义了。自己提这个意见，想不到受到厂长、主任这样的重视和支持，心里一阵感激，呆呆地站在那里不动了。噹的一声，工人已将三号锯拆开，他好像被人推了一把，旋风似地跑了过去，爬上锯台和工人一起检修三号锯去了。
