    Tigers Can Also Reproduce in Cages
    ——A Correction to "On Tigers"
    I recently received a letter from Comrade Jia Yusi of the Gardening Technical School in the Summer Palace, stating that the situation where tigers cannot reproduce in cages is a thing of the past. As long as the cages are spacious and provide a playground; “live feed” (rabbits, etc.) is given regularly; and attention is paid to hygiene and disinfection to prevent the transmission of parasites, tigers can reproduce in cages. The tigers raised in the Beijing Zoo have given birth to tiger cubs. This is a supplementary explanation.　Zhou Jianren

    槛内老虎也能生育
    ——对“说虎”一文的补正
    顷接颐和园内园林技校嘉于斯同志来信，说明虎在槛内不能生育的情况已成过去，只要槛舍宽大并给以运动场；定期给以“活饲料”（兔等）；和注意卫生消毒，不传染寄生虫等，虎是能在槛里繁殖的。北京动物园内饲养的虎就生过小虎。特此补充说明。　周建人
