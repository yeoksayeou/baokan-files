Xinhua News Agency, December 18th Dispatch from London: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd stated in the House of Commons on the 17th, regarding the clearing of the Suez Canal, that Britain and France still insist that the United Nations use British and French salvage vessels and personnel to clear the canal, but he said, "This proposal has not been accepted."

Lloyd expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements for clearing the canal, and said that the relevant "governments and individuals" must actively begin to use manpower and resources from all countries to clear the canal. According to a United Press report, the "individuals" mentioned by Lloyd were a "veiled attack" on the head of the UN salvage team, American General Wheeler. The British press and members of parliament have been constantly criticizing Wheeler for the past two weeks, saying that he does not use British and French salvage personnel.

Some members of the House of Commons advocated slowing down the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt until Britain's above-mentioned demands were met. It is known that Britain has already announced that it will withdraw British troops "without delay". Lloyd replied that British troops would be completely withdrawn in the "near future," but he refused to specify an exact date.

News has it that Britain and France have made a request to the United Nations, setting a deadline for accepting British and French salvage personnel. Otherwise, they will withdraw the salvage fleet and allow a partially salvaged blockade ship to sink back to the bottom of the canal.

(Editor's note) According to Western newspapers, the Anglo-French war of aggression against Egypt has caused extremely serious blockages in the Suez Canal. Forty-nine ships of various sizes are sunk in the canal and the seaports at both ends of the canal. To restore navigation in the canal, these sunken ships must be refloated or towed out of the canal. Because the canal is narrow (300 feet wide) and shallow (38 feet deep), there are many restrictions on the cleaning process: tidal power is not strong enough to help refloat the sunken ships; if explosives are used, the sandbanks on both sides will collapse. Therefore, the canal cleaning work will take about three to six months, or even more. The cost will be approximately tens of millions to one hundred million US dollars.

### 劳埃德在下院表示  英国坚持要参加清理运河  拒绝说明英侵略军完全撤退的日期

    劳埃德在下院表示
    英国坚持要参加清理运河
    拒绝说明英侵略军完全撤退的日期
    据新华社18日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德17日在下院谈到清理运河问题时表示，英法仍然坚持由联合国使用英法的打捞船只和人员来清理运河，但是他说：“这个建议没有被接受”。
    劳埃德对清理运河的安排表示不满，并且说，有关“政府和个人”必须积极着手使用一切国家的人力物力来清理运河。据合众社消息说，劳埃德所提到的“个人”，是对联合国打捞小组负责人、美国将军惠勒的“含蓄的攻击”。英国报界和议员过去两周来曾不断抨击惠勒，说他不使用英法打捞人员。
    下议院里有人主张在英国的上述要求被采纳以前放慢从埃及撤走英军的速度，大家知道，英国已经宣布过将“毫不拖延的”撤走英军。劳埃德回答说，英国军队将在“最近的将来”撤退完毕，但是他拒绝说明准确的日期。
    有消息说，英法两国已经向联合国提出要求限期接受英法的打捞人员。否则，它们就要撤走打捞船队，并且让一只部分捞起的封锁船再沉到运河底下去。
    （编者注）据西方报刊报道，英法以侵埃战争使苏伊士运河阻塞的情况极为严重。有四十九艘大小轮船，沉在运河内和运河两端的海港里。要使运河恢复通航，必须把这些沉船再浮起来，或拖出运河。由于运河又狭（宽度三百呎）又浅（深度三十八呎），进行清理时还要受到许多限制：潮水冲力不够大，对浮起沉船帮助不大；如使用炸药，两岸的沙岸会塌下来。因此，清理运河工作，需要三个月到六个月左右，甚至更多的时间。费用约需几千万至一亿美元。
