    Guangdong Establishes Nine New Disease-Free Citrus Nurseries
    (Our dispatch) The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture has recently established nine new disease-free citrus nurseries in Chao'yang, Gao'ming, Yangshan, Longchuan, Pubei, Sihui, Haikou, and other nine counties and cities. By 1960, they will be able to cultivate 2.7 million citrus seedlings, enough to plant 45,000 mu of mountain land. These nurseries have now begun cultivating the land, preparing for sowing.
    In the past, citrus seedling cultivation in Guangdong was concentrated in the Baojingyuan area of Puning County. In recent years, due to the occurrence of citrus Huanglongbing (yellow dragon disease), many seedlings could not be sold, affecting the development of citrus in the province. The establishment of disease-free nurseries will further prevent the spread of Huanglongbing, cultivate more high-quality seedlings, and meet the needs of various regions within the province.

    广东新建九个柑桔无病苗圃
    本报讯　广东省农业厅最近已在潮阳、高明、阳山、龙川、浦北、四会、海口等九个县、市新建九个柑桔无病苗圃，到1960年可培育出二百七十万株柑桔苗木，足够四万五千亩山地栽用。现在这些苗圃已开始耕地，准备播种。
    广东柑桔育苗以前集中在普宁县的宝镜院一带；近年来，由于柑桔黄龙病的发生，不少柑苗无法卖出，影响全省柑桔的发展。建立了无病苗圃以后，将进一步防止黄龙病的蔓延，培育更多优良的苗木，满足省内各地的需要。（肖俊城）
