    On Distant Shores

    There are twelve million overseas Chinese scattered all over the world, and the pulse of these twelve million people's thoughts and feelings beats in unison with that of the people at home. In this regard, I often think of countless moving events, which make me enter a state of emotional tipsiness, as if I have drunk fine wine. Although I have been away from overseas and returned to China for a long time.
    Henryk Sienkiewicz, a Polish classical writer, has a short story called "The Lighthouse Keeper." It tells the story of an old Polish man who wandered in foreign lands in the nineteenth century. Because of his resistance to oppression, he wandered abroad for most of his life. In his declining years, he yearned to obtain a stable position to spend the rest of his life. In an unexpected opportunity, he found a job as a lighthouse keeper. This job was extremely lonely. He spent all day with the tides and seagulls, and could not even see a shadow of a person on the remote reef. The only job was to light the lights on time every day so that the ships coming and going would not be in distress. This job was very easy, but it was absolutely not allowed to go wrong. As long as there was one mistake, he would lose his position and start wandering again. The old man liked this job very much, and he lit the lighthouse on time and never made mistakes. But once he received a package, someone sent him a collection of poems by a Polish poet. He read the books, and the thousands of threads of emotion with the motherland immersed him in a state of intoxication. He recalled, pondered, was excited, and yearned, lying down for several hours as if he were drunk, and finally forgot to light the lights. As a result, he was dismissed.
    The stories of many overseas Chinese cherishing their motherland, the scene, has many similarities with the Polish old man in this novel.
    Madame Soong Ching Ling visited Indonesia and recounted an incident she saw on Bali: "The copper coins that are no longer easily seen in our country can be found in every household on Bali. It hasn't been long since these copper coins were discontinued. Now people tie the copper coins into strings and hang them up as indispensable sacred objects in religious ceremonies. In a silverware shop, we found strings of copper coins with the Kaiyuan reign, the Wanli reign, and various reigns of the Qing Dynasty..." This seemingly small phenomenon contains the people's feelings of cherishing the motherland.
    Similar to this phenomenon, I remember many overseas Chinese keeping the ancient customs of their motherland. This situation does not mean "conservatism" in the ordinary sense. They are precisely using this to express their never-forgetting thoughts of their home country. Just like the Polish composer Chopin, when he went to wander in Western Europe, he always carried a handful of soil from his motherland, which had a profound meaning.
    In the 72nd chapter of "Dream of the Red Chamber," the conversation between Wang Xifeng and Jia Lian when she was throwing a tantrum mentions a word: "Han Kou Dian Bei." This is an ancient superstitious custom, putting a pearl or some rice in the mouth of the dead is called "Han Kou"; putting some money under the shroud when encoffining is called "Dian Bei." This custom was not easily seen in the country, even before liberation. But it is still quite popular among overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. My mother adopted this ritual when she was encoffined. In Fujian, in the early Qing Dynasty, many people with lofty ideals who opposed the Qing Dynasty and restored the Ming Dynasty and those influenced by them, were accustomed to covering their faces with a white cloth when encoffining. The meaning is: "The cause of opposing the Qing Dynasty and restoring the Ming Dynasty has not been completed, ashamed to see the ancestors in the ground." This custom was also brought overseas by a part of Fujian overseas Chinese.
    The memory of ancient heroes and heroines of the motherland is a common feeling of countless overseas Chinese. In the tropical rainy night, family members, father and son, gathered together to talk about Guo Ziyi, Xue Rengui, Yue Fei..., which is a common thing in many overseas Chinese families. In the Southeast Asia area, people also admire the eunuch Zheng He of Sanbao, who once set foot on that land. When relatives and friends gather under the lamp, the topic often naturally turns to this eunuch. This eunuch of Sanbao, who had been on a mission seven times five hundred years ago, with a voyage of 160,000 nautical miles, seems to have become an omnipotent alien in the mouths of many overseas Chinese. Some adults in Southeast Asia sometimes mutter when they encounter difficulties: "Sanbao Gong bless, Sanbao Gong bless!" The respect of overseas Chinese for Zheng He is rendered with many mythical colors. The reason why they do this, seriously investigated, actually hides some rather sad reasons. In the past, when overseas Chinese did not have a strong motherland and were still in the situation of "orphans overseas," they had to miss and mythologize the ancestors who raised their eyebrows and exhaled in the past, and had to use "Eunuch Sanbao" to express their damaged national self-esteem.
    The remembrance of glorious ancestors and the preservation of customs and habits shine with strong patriotic feelings in these phenomena. From America to Europe, from Africa to Southeast Asia, numerous overseas Chinese insist on eating Chinese food, wearing homespun clothes, wearing Guangdong wooden clogs, eating fermented bean curd, salted fish, preserved vegetables, and herbal tea transported from their distant hometowns or made by themselves; they continue to celebrate our Qingming, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Winter Solstice, and their ancestors and grandchildren have persisted for hundreds of years. Why are some customs gradually changing or disappearing in the country, but they are so firmly preserved overseas? A good answer can be found here.

    在遥远的海岸上
    秦牧
    中国有一千二百万华侨散布在世界各地，这一千二百万人和国内人民的思想感情的脉搏是一同跳动着的。在这方面，我常常想起无数动人的事件，使自己像喝过醇酒似地进入一种感情微醺的境界。虽然我离开海外回到国内来已经很久很久了。
    波兰古典作家显克微支有一个短篇小说叫做“灯塔看守人”。里面讲的是十九世纪流浪异国的一个波兰老人的故事。这老人因为反抗压迫，在国外流浪了大半生，到他衰朽的暮年，异常困倦地渴望获得一个安定的位置度过他的余生。在意外的机会中他找到了一个看守灯塔的职业。这工作是异常寂寞孤独的。整天和潮汐海鸥为伍，在偏僻的岩礁上，连人影也不见一个。唯一的工作就是每天按时燃着灯火，使来往的船只不致失事。这工作很轻便，但绝对不容许误事。只要有一次的错失，他就得失掉位置，重新去作无所归依的流浪了。老人是很喜欢这工作的，他按时点燃灯塔，从不误事。但有一次他收到了一个邮包，有人寄给他一本波兰诗人的诗集。他翻读着书籍，和祖国的千丝万缕的感情使他沉浸于一种如醉如痴的境界，他回忆、沉思、激动、神往，像喝醉了酒似地一连躺了好几个钟头，终于忘记燃点灯火。于是，他被撤职了。
    许许多多华侨眷念祖国的故事，那情景，是和这个小说中的波兰老人有很多相似之处的。
    宋庆龄先生访问印度尼西亚，回来叙述过她在峇厘岛上见到的一桩事情道：“我们国内已不易看到的铜钱，在峇厘岛上家家都能找到，这种铜钱被停止流通还是不久的事情。现在人们把铜钱结成一串一串的吊起来，当做宗教仪式上不可缺少的神器。在一家银器店里我们发现一串串的铜钱中有开元年号的，有万历年号的，也有清朝各种年号的……。”这种表面上看起来很细小的事象，里面蕴藏着的人们眷念祖国的感情却是多么的强烈啊。
    和这种事象相仿佛，我记起了华侨许多保持祖国古老的风俗习惯的事情。这种情形意味的决不是普通意义的“保守”。他们正是以这来寄托他们永不忘本的家国之思的。正像波兰的作曲家萧邦，到西欧去流浪时，永远带着一撮祖国的泥土那样，具有深远的寓意。
    “红楼梦”七十二回，从王熙凤向贾琏发脾气的谈话中讲到一个词儿：“衔口垫背”。那是一种古老的迷信的风俗，在死人嘴里放一颗珍珠或一些米叫做“衔口”；入殓时在装殓的褥下放一些钱叫做“垫背”。这风俗在国内，即使在解放前也已经不容易见到了。但在南洋华侨当中还相当地流传着，我的母亲入殓时就采用了这种仪式。在福建，清初时候，许多反清复明的志士和他们所影响的人们，入殓时习惯在脸部盖上一块白布。那意义是：“反清复明事业未成，羞见先人于地下”。这习俗，也同样随着一部分福建侨民带到海外去。
    对古代祖国英雄豪杰的怀念，是无数华侨共有的感情。在热带的雨夜，家人父子围在一起谈郭子仪、薛仁贵，岳飞……，是许多华侨家庭常有的事。在南洋一带，人们又十分推崇曾经踏上那边土地的三保太监郑和。亲戚朋友们在灯下聚谈的时候，话题常常很自然地拉到这个太监身上去。这位在五百多年前曾经出使七次，航程十六万海里的三保太监，在许多华侨口中仿佛变成了一个无所不能的异人。南洋有些成人遇到困难，有时还会喃喃祈祷道：“三宝公保佑，三宝公保佑！”南洋侨胞对郑和的尊崇，是渲染上许多神话色彩的。他们所以这样做，严肃追究起来，实际上藏着一些颇为辛酸的理由。从前，当华侨没有一个强盛的祖国，还处在“海外孤儿”的境地的时候，他们不得不怀念和神化当年扬眉吐气的先人，不得不通过“三保太监”来寄托他们备受损害的民族自尊心。
    对于光荣先人的追念，对于风俗习惯的保持，在这些现象里面，闪耀着强烈的爱国主义感情。从美洲到欧洲，从非洲到南洋，众多的华侨坚持着吃中国饭，穿土布衣服，着广东木履，吃从遥远的家乡运来、或者自制的腐乳、咸鱼、霉菜、凉茶；继续过我们的清明、端午、中秋、冬至，祖孙累代数百年如一日地坚持着。为什么有些风俗在国内已经逐渐改变或者丧失了，在海外却那么牢固地保存着，从这里是可以找到很好的答案的。
