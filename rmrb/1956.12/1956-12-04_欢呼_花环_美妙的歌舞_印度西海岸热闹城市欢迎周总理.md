Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, December 3rd: This lively city on India's west coast welcomed Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long with cheers, garlands, and musical dance performances by artists at sunset on the 2nd. The welcome reception, jointly organized by twelve cultural groups, was held in front of the Sir J. J. School of Art, one of the oldest art schools in Indian history.

　　The musical dance program was performed on the green lawn covered with palm and large trees. Under the large trees hung with colored light bulbs, the graceful hand movements of the gorgeously dressed female dancers and the movements of their bare feet tapping on the temporary stage floor deeply attracted the audience. The balconies of nearby buildings were also packed with spectators watching the Maupoli dance and classical dance from southern India performed here.

　　Before the program began, Zhou Enlai and He Long visited the painting exhibition in the school hall. Member of Parliament S.K. Patil welcomed the guests on behalf of the twelve cultural groups that organized the reception. He said that cultural exchanges between India and China had been going on "long before the beginning" of modern history. He added that the grand welcome that Bombay extended to the Chinese guests was a symbol of Indian-Chinese friendship. He said: "If the billion people of India and China desire peace and friendship, no force in the world can separate them. We look forward to a future of peace and friendship without war, and we are all dedicated to this future."

　　Premier Zhou Enlai said that he felt as if he were in his own home when he came to India. He said that no words could describe the joy in his heart. He hoped that more Chinese people would visit India to learn about Indian sculpture and art. He said: "We are willing to invite a large number of Indians to China to meet with their Chinese counterparts."

　　He concluded by hoping that the Chinese and Indian peoples "will learn from each other to develop their national culture and art so that the cultures of the two countries can better serve world peace."

　　Premier Zhou presented flowers to the artists after their performance.

　　Immediately after arriving, Zhou Enlai and his entourage visited the Bombay Museum and Art Gallery. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by Chagla, the acting Governor of Bombay State.

    欢呼·花环·美妙的歌舞
　　印度西海岸热闹城市欢迎周总理
    新华社孟买3日电　印度西海岸的这个热闹的城市在2日日落时分以欢呼、花环和艺术家们演出的音乐舞蹈节目来欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理。由十二个文化团体联合举办的这个欢迎会，是在印度历史最悠久的艺术学校之一杰杰艺术学校前面举行的。
    音乐舞蹈节目在棕榈和大树复盖的绿茵上演出。在悬挂着彩色灯泡的大树下，盛装的女舞蹈演员们的优美的手部动作和赤足敲蹬临时舞台的地板的动作，深深地吸引了观众。附近建筑物的阳台上也挤满了观众，观看在这里演出的毛坡里舞和印度南部的古典舞蹈。
    在节目开始以前，周恩来、贺龙参观了学校大厅中的绘画展览。议会议员斯·库·帕蒂尔代表举办这次欢迎会的十二个文化团体向来宾表示欢迎。他说，印度和中国之间的文化交流早在现代史“开始之前很久”就在进行。他又说，孟买对中国来宾所表示的盛大欢迎就是印中友谊的象征。他说：“如果印中两国的十亿人民希望和平和友谊的话，世界上没有任何力量能把它们分开，我们瞻望着没有战争的和平和友善的未来，我们都献身于这个未来。”
    周恩来总理说，他觉得到印度来好像在自己的家里一样。他说，没有言语足以描写他心中的欢乐。他希望有更多的中国人到印度访问以便学习印度的雕刻和艺术。他说：“我们愿意邀请大批印度人到中国去和他们的中国同行们见面。”
    他最后希望中国人民和印度人民“互相学习来发展他们的民族文化和艺术，以便使两国的文化能够更好地为世界和平服务”。
    周总理在艺术家们表演结束以后向他们献花。
    周恩来和他的随行人员到达以后立即就参观了孟买的博物馆和艺术馆。晚间，他们出席了孟买邦代理邦长查格拉的宴会。
