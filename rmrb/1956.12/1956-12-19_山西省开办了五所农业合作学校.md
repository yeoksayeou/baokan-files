Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th: The five agricultural cooperative schools newly opened in Shanxi Province to train cadres for agricultural production cooperatives have recently opened in Changzhi City and Linfen, Jiexiu, Xinxian, Shuoxian and other places.

According to statistics from four of these schools, the first batch of nearly two thousand agricultural cooperative directors, accountants, technicians, and feeders will participate in the study.

In addition to educating agricultural cooperative cadres on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and democratically, these schools will also conduct courses on agricultural cooperative management, financial accounting, agricultural technology, and livestock breeding for agricultural cooperative directors, chief accountants, and agricultural and animal husbandry technicians respectively. Schools with the conditions and needs also plan to open sericulture and fruit and vegetable specialties.

At present, the agricultural leadership department is preparing to convene a meeting of the principals of the five schools to study the teaching plan and syllabus. The teaching staff of each school will edit teaching materials while teaching and learning, adapting to local conditions.

These schools are tentatively scheduled to graduate in four to six months, and it is expected that key agricultural cooperative backbones throughout the province will be gradually absorbed for a relatively systematic education within two years.
