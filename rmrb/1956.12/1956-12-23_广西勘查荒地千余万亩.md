Guangxi Surveys Over Ten Million Mu of Wasteland

(Our Newspaper News) Since July of this year, Guangxi Province has surveyed 13.2 million mu of wasteland, of which 75% is arable. This wasteland has fertile soil and is mostly located within the counties of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture. According to preliminary surveys, this wasteland is mostly mountainous and hilly, suitable for planting economic trees such as tung oil trees, oil tea trees, and star anise. Coffee is now being tested in the wasteland. The wasteland belonging to the low hill type is suitable for planting subtropical economic crops such as sugar cane, Sea Island cotton, and sisal hemp, and some can be planted with sweet potatoes, upland rice, corn and other food crops.

    广西勘查荒地千余万亩
    本报讯　广西省自今年7月以来，已勘查荒地一千三百二十万亩，其中可垦荒地占75％。这些荒地土质肥沃，多数在桂西僮族自治州所属各县境内。据初步调查，这些荒地多属于山地和高丘类型，宜于种植油桐、油茶、八角等经济林木。现在，荒地内已试种咖啡。属于低丘类型的荒地宜于种植甘蔗、海岛棉、剑麻等亚热带经济作物，部分可种红薯、旱稻、玉米等粮食作物。
