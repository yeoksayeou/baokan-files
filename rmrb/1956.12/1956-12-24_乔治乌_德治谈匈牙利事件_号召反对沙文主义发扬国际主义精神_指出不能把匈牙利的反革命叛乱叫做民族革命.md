Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 23rd - TASS reports: Party representative conferences of the Romanian Workers' Party are currently being held throughout Romania. Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party are participating in these conferences.

    Gheorghiu-Dej, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, participated in the party representative conference of the Hungarian Autonomous Region and delivered a speech. In his speech, when talking about the events that recently occurred in Hungary, he said that the organizers and supporters of the Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion aimed to restore the bourgeois landlord system, separate Hungary from the socialist family, abolish its national independence, and turn it into a breeding ground for aggression, provocations, and revisionist activities, all of which pose a threat to peace in Europe and the world. A movement that drags Hungary backward in terms of socio-economic development, re-establishes the rule of the exploiting classes, and creates enslavement by imperialist countries cannot be called a revolution.

    Western reactionary newspapers and radio stations widely use the term "national revolution" when reporting on the Hungarian events. It is perfectly clear that, in reality, only movements aimed at overthrowing foreign oppression, striving for liberation, striving for independence, and national sovereignty can be called that. Such movements are unfolding more and more widely in some colonial and dependent countries such as Algeria, Malaya, Cyprus, and South Korea, where the people are waging a heroic struggle to overthrow imperialist oppression. This is the real national liberation movement. The situation is completely different for the Hungarian people, who, after overthrowing fascist rule, established their own state power, which was realized in a free, independent, and autonomous country. If the counter-revolutionary conspiracy had succeeded, it would have separated Hungary from its true friends—the socialist countries—and Hungary would have suffered economic and political enslavement by the imperialist countries.

    In his speech, Gheorghiu-Dej emphasized that the responsibility of Romanian communists is to consolidate the unity of the party and strengthen ties with the masses. The Romanian Workers' Party calls on all party members and workers to continuously strengthen the worker-peasant alliance and strengthen the leading role of the working class in this alliance; to develop friendship and fraternal cooperation between the Romanian people and all nationalities. Every party organization must wage a relentless struggle against all manifestations of nationalism and chauvinism; and educate the working people in the spirit of socialist patriotism and proletarian internationalism.

    Editor's Note: Romania is a multi-ethnic country. Hungarians account for 9.4% of Romania's total population (approximately 1.6 million people), and they live in the western region of Romania, where the Hungarian Autonomous Region was established.

    乔治乌—德治谈匈牙利事件
    号召反对沙文主义发扬国际主义精神
    指出不能把匈牙利的反革命叛乱叫做民族革命
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社布加勒斯特22日讯：罗马尼亚各地目前正举行罗马尼亚工人党的党代表会议。罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局的委员们参加了这些会议。
    罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会第一书记乔治乌—德治参加了匈牙利族自治州的党代表会议，并且发表了演说。他在演说中谈到不久前在匈牙利发生的事件时说道，匈牙利反革命叛乱的组织者和支持者的目的是要恢复资产阶级地主制度，把匈牙利同社会主义国家大家庭分割开，取消它的民族独立，把它变成侵略、挑衅和边界修订主义者进行活动的策源地，所有这些对欧洲和世界和平都是威胁。不能把那种将匈牙利在社会经济发展方面向后拖的、重新建立剥削阶级统治和造成帝国主义国家奴役的运动叫做革命。
    西方反动的报刊和电台在报道匈牙利事件时广泛使用“民族革命”这一术语，人们完全清楚，实际上只有旨在推翻外国压迫，争取解放，争取独立和民族主权的运动才能这样称呼。这种运动在阿尔及利亚、马来亚、塞浦路斯、南朝鲜等一些殖民地国家和附庸国家中越来越广泛地展开着，这些国家的人民进行着推翻帝国主义压迫的英勇斗争。这才是真正的民族解放运动。匈牙利人民完全是另一种情况，它在推翻法西斯统治后建立了自己的国家政权，这个政权是在自由、独立和自主的国家中实现的。如果反革命阴谋得逞，它就会把匈牙利和它的真正朋友——社会主义国家分割开，匈牙利在经济上和政治上就会遭到帝国主义国家的奴役。
    乔治乌—德治在演说中强调指出，罗马尼亚共产党人的责任就是巩固党的团结，加强与群众的联系。罗马尼亚工人党号召所有党员和劳动者不断加强工农联盟和加强在这一联盟中工人阶级的领导作用；发展罗马尼亚人民和一切民族之间的友谊和兄弟般的合作。每个党组织必须对民族主义和沙文主义的各种表现进行无情的斗争；以社会主义爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义的精神教育劳动人民。
    编者注　罗马尼亚是一个多民族的国家。匈牙利族的人口占罗马尼亚总人口9.4％（大约一百六十万人），他们聚居在罗马尼亚西部地区，成立了匈牙利族自治州。
