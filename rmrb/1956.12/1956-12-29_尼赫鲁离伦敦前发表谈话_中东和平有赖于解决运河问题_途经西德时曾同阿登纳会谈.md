Xinhua News Agency, December 28th, London Dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru flew back to his country from London on the 27th. During his three-day stay in Britain, he held talks with British Prime Minister Eden.

Before returning to his country, Nehru answered some questions raised by reporters at the airport. He said that his talks with Eden and with Eisenhower were of a "general nature" and did not discuss any specific proposals for resolving the Middle East issue. One reporter asked Nehru if he had any proposals regarding UN control of the Suez Canal, to which he replied: "I do not have such a proposal. As far as I know, the Egyptian government has long ago resolutely opposed and rejected UN control of the Suez Canal or international control of the Suez Canal."

When talking about the prospects for peace in the Middle East, he said, "This is a difficult problem." He believes that before discussing this issue, certain further steps should be taken first, primarily dealing with the Suez Canal issue. He said: "The first thing is to clear the Suez Canal. The second, naturally, is the future of the Suez Canal. After that, broader issues can be discussed." He also said that even then, "the better approach might be to clear away obstacles through some less formal channels before formally meeting."

Regarding how long it would take to clear the canal, Nehru said that, according to the opinion of the UN experts responsible for clearing the canal, it is expected to take about ten weeks.

Xinhua News Agency, December 28th, Dusseldorf Dispatch: When Indian Prime Minister Nehru passed through West Germany on the 27th on his way back home from London, West German Chancellor Adenauer hurriedly traveled from Bonn to Dusseldorf to hold a secret meeting with Nehru for eighty-five minutes.

After the meeting, Nehru told reporters that he and Adenauer "discussed various important developments in the Middle East, Europe, and other parts of the world."

According to the Associated Press, Adenauer made a special trip to meet with Nehru because he "hoped to get information about Nehru's meetings with President Eisenhower, Prime Minister Eden, and Canadian and UN officials." In addition, Adenauer also hoped to seek India's support for his policy on the German unification issue.

    尼赫鲁离伦敦前发表谈话
    中东和平有赖于解决运河问题
    途经西德时曾同阿登纳会谈
    新华社28日讯　伦敦消息：印度总理尼赫鲁27日从伦敦乘飞机返国。他在英国停留的三天中，曾经同英国首相艾登举行了会谈。
    尼赫鲁返国前在机场回答了记者们提出的一些问题。他说，他同艾登以及同艾森豪威尔的会谈都是“一般性质”的，没有讨论到关于解决中东问题的任何具体建议。有的记者问尼赫鲁是否有任何关于联合国管制苏伊士运河的建议，他回答道：“我没有这样一种建议。据我所知道的，联合国管制苏伊士运河或是国际管制苏伊士运河在很久以前就遭到了埃及政府的断然反对和拒绝。”
    他在谈到中东的和平前途的问题时说，“这是一个困难的问题”。他认为在讨论这个问题之前，应当先采取某些进一步的步骤，首先是处理苏伊士运河问题。他说：“第一件事是清理苏伊士运河。其次自然是苏伊士运河的前途问题。在这以后可以讨论较为广泛的问题。”他还说：即使在那时，“较好的办法可能是在正式开会之前，先通过某些不大正式的途径来扫除障碍”。
    关于清理运河需要多久时间，尼赫鲁说，根据负责清理运河的联合国专家的意见，预料大约需要十个星期。
    新华社28日讯　杜塞尔多夫消息：当印度总理尼赫鲁27日从伦敦回国经过西德的时候，西德总理阿登纳急忙从波恩跑到杜塞尔多夫，同尼赫鲁进行了八十五分钟的秘密会谈。
    会谈后，尼赫鲁向记者们说，他同阿登纳“讨论了中东、欧洲和世界其他地区的各种重要的事态发展”。
    据美联社报道，阿登纳之所以特地赶去同尼赫鲁会谈，是因为他
  “希望得到尼赫鲁同艾森豪威尔总统、艾登首相以及加拿大和联合国官员们会谈情况的消息”。此外，阿登纳还希望为他对德国统一问题的政策谋取印度的支持。
