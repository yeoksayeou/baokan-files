　　Thoughts on an Untitled Piece
　　Zhong Huai
    A reader wrote to say that a leading cadre in a factory, troubled by not understanding the workers' thoughts, came up with a clever plan: to have some members of the Communist Youth League deliberately say some "backward things" among the masses, to "cast a brick to attract jade," and draw out the backward thoughts and vague understandings among the workers.
    If one wants to understand whether these leading cadres have bureaucracy and how much, there's no need to "cast a brick to attract jade." The fact that they have to resort to this method to understand the masses' thoughts exposes their bureaucratic work style of being detached from the masses.
    According to the Hunan Daily, a responsible cadre from a certain unit attended an important meeting. When it was his turn to report on his work, he calmly took out a stack of materials and read them out, word by word. The content of the materials was not bad, but there was one thing that was puzzling: after many statistical figures, he would read out "0—0." The person chairing the meeting took a look at his report and realized that the "0—0" he was saying was the percentage sign (％).
    The author couldn't help but lament: "It's not surprising: the materials were written by subordinates for him, and he was just acting as a megaphone."
    However, I must speak up for the megaphone, because a megaphone, when transmitting sound, would not distort it to such an extent as to transmit "×× percent" as "××0—0".

    读者来信说，有一个工厂的领导干部苦于不了解工人的思想情况，就想出了一个妙法：要一些团员到群众中去故意讲些“落后话”，来一个“抛砖引玉”，把工人中的落后思想和模糊认识引出来。
    谁要了解这些领导干部有没有和有多少官僚主义，倒是不需要“抛砖引玉”的。他们不得不借助于这种办法来了解群众的思想情况，这就把他们脱离群众的官僚主义作风暴露无遗了。
    据新湖南报载，某单位的负责干部出席一次重要会议，当轮到他汇报工作的时候，他不慌不忙取出一叠材料来，一句一句地照着念。材料内容并不坏，只是有一点叫人莫解：在很多统计数字后面，他都念上个“0—0 ”。主持会议的人把他的汇报材料拿来一看，原来他口中的“0—0”乃是百分比符号（％）。
    作者不胜感慨：“说来也并不奇怪：材料是下属替他写的，他只不过当个传声筒罢了。”
    不过我倒要替传声筒抱屈，因为传声筒在传声的时候，还不致如此走样，把“百分之××”传成“××0—0”。
