    The Millstone Turns Merrily, Commune Members Rejoice
    As soon as the sky began to lighten, the rumbling sound came from the mill. A twelve-year-old child walked in with a bag of corn kernels, and in less than five minutes, exchanged it for a bag of corn flour, skipping and jumping home. Then came the old men, the old women...
    This is the mill established by Fangjiatun District in Kangping County, Liaoning Province, for the members of the agricultural cooperative. Just over twenty days ago, there were no mills here. The commune members had to grind their own corn flour with "stone rollers" every day. Every day, more than 2,400 women, elderly people, and elementary school students were busy grinding corn flour. Because there were few "stone rollers" and many people grinding, many commune members couldn't get a turn. Some commune members holding golden corn said: Corn is delicious, but the flour is hard to grind!
    After the Fangjiatun District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this problem, it immediately convened a meeting of cooperative directors in early October to study and come up with a solution to the difficulty of grinding corn flour: the cooperative would grind flour uniformly, and the members would exchange raw grain for finished products. In this way, more than 2,400 women, elderly people, and elementary school students would no longer be delayed from other things because of pushing the "stone rollers." Take the single commune member Wang Hailou as an example. In the past, he had to take one day out of every three days to push the "stone roller," resulting in earning more than 800 fewer work points this year. After the cooperative implemented unified flour grinding, he said happily: "This time I may earn more work points!"

### 磨盘隆隆响  社员喜洋洋

    磨盘隆隆响  社员喜洋洋
    天刚蒙蒙亮，磨房里就传出了隆隆的响声。一个十二岁的小孩提着一袋玉米粒走了进去，还没有五分钟，就换回一袋玉米面，连蹦带跳地回家去了。接着，老大爷、老大娘……。
    这是辽宁康平县方家屯区为农业社社员们设立的磨房。在二十多天以前，这里并没有什么磨房。社员们每天吃的玉米面，都得自己用“碾子”去轧。每天，专为轧玉米面而忙碌着的妇女、老年、小学生等，就有两千四百多人。由于“碾子”少、轧面的人多，还有不少社员挤不上。有的社员捧着金光灿灿的玉米说：玉米好吃，面难轧呀！
    中共方家屯区委会发现这一问题后，当即在10月上旬召开了社主任会议，研究出解决轧玉米面困难的办法：由社里统一磨面，社员用原粮换取成品。这样，就使两千四百多个妇女、老年、小学生等不再因推“碾子”而耽误别的事情了。拿单身社员王海楼来说，他在过去三天中，就要抽出一天时间来推“碾子”，结果今年少挣了八百多个工分。社里实行统一磨面后，他高兴地说：“这回可能多挣工分了！”
