Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 21st: The state-owned Xiangshan Pyrite Mine has not had a single fatal accident in production since May 1952, and the number of minor and major injuries has also decreased year by year.

Before 1952, this old mine with a long history of mining experienced fatal accidents every year. Later, the mine repeatedly examined and criticized the leadership's view of emphasizing output and neglecting safety, and strengthened safety technical education for employees. They successively held training courses such as "Mining Technology", "Dedicated Blasting" and "Mine Rescue", and organized the majority of employees to systematically study basic knowledge of mine safety and technical operating procedures. The mine's administrative leadership also further strengthened technical and administrative management and improved the working conditions of employees. For example, the ventilation in the mine was originally poor, and the air in some working faces was thin, making it difficult for workers to breathe. The mine specially built a ventilation inclined shaft and installed a fan to ensure that workers get enough air. The mine also stipulated the safety inspection responsibility system for engineers, technicians and duty personnel.

The Party organization of this mine also often pays attention to educating Communist Party members to exemplarily abide by operating procedures in production to ensure safe production. This year, the Party committee of this mine has organized three inspection teams to go deep into the workshops to check the safety situation. The mine's trade union organization also regularly mobilizes employees to check and summarize the experience and lessons of safe production, and organizes employees to exchange experiences in safe production. In competitions and advanced producer movements, safety is also listed as one of the main conditions.

    关心劳动条件，重视安全生产
    向山硫铁矿四年未出死亡事故
    新华社合肥21日电　国营向山硫铁矿自1952年5月以来，在生产中一直没有发生过死亡事故，轻、重伤事故也逐年减少。
    这个开采年代很久的老矿井，在1952年前，年年都发生死亡事故。后来，这个矿反复检查和批判了领导人员重产量、轻安全的观点，加强了对职工的安全技术教育。他们先后举办了“采矿技术”、“专职爆破”和“矿山救护”等训练班，并且组织广大职工系统地学习了矿山安全基本知识和技术操作规程。矿的行政领导部门也进一步加强了技术管理和行政管理，改善了职工的劳动条件。如原来矿井里通风不良，有的工作面空气稀薄，工人呼吸困难，矿上便专门打了通风斜井，安装了扇风机，保证工人得到足够的空气。矿上还规定了工程师、技术员和值班员的安全检查责任制度。
    这个矿的党组织也经常注意教育共产党员在生产中模范地遵守操作规程，保证安全生产。今年这个矿的党委曾经组织三次检查组，深入车间检查安全情况。矿上的工会组织，也经常发动职工检查和总结安全生产的经验和教训，组织职工交流安全生产经验。在竞赛和先进生产者运动中，也把安全列为主要条件之一。
