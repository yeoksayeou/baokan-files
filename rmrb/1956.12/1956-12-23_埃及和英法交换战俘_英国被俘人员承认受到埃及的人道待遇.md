Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd dispatch from Port Said: Egypt and the Anglo-French invading forces exchanged prisoners of war on December 21st at Kap, twenty-two miles south of Port Said.

    The British and French side handed over 369 Egyptian prisoners of war, including 251 soldiers and 125 civilians. Egypt also handed over to the other side 456 personnel detained after the Anglo-French invasion who remained at the original British Suez Canal Zone base.

    The exchange of prisoners of war was originally scheduled for December 20th. However, Egypt learned that France had abducted some Egyptian personnel to France and Cyprus. Therefore, it immediately announced that unless these personnel were returned, the exchange of prisoners of war would not proceed. As a result, France had to recall a ship that had sailed from Port Said carrying 160 abducted Egyptian prisoners of war, and also sent aircraft to return the seven Egyptian officers who had already been abducted to France.

    According to Agence France-Presse, most British prisoners of war said they received humane treatment from the Egyptian authorities.

    埃及和英法交换战俘
    英国被俘人员承认受到埃及的人道待遇
    新华社22日讯　塞得港消息：埃及和英法侵略军当局12月21日在塞得港南面二十二英里的卡普交换了双方的被俘人员。
    英法方面交出了三百六十九名埃及被俘人员，其中军人二百五十一名，平民一百二十五名。埃及也把英法发动侵略后所拘留的留在原来英国苏伊士运河区基地上的四百五十六名人员移交给对方。
    交换被俘人员原定12月20日举行，后来埃及获悉法国已把一部分埃及人员劫运往法国和塞浦路斯，因而立即宣布，除非交还这些人员，将不进行交换被俘人员。结果法国不得不把一艘开出塞得港的劫运着一百六十名埃及被俘人员的船只叫回来，并且派飞机把已经劫运到法国去的七名埃及军官也送回来。
    据法新社报道，多数英国被俘人员都说，他们受到埃及当局的人道待遇。
