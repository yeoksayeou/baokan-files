Xinhua News Agency, 18th. China's cement production completed the Five-Year Plan one year and one month ahead of schedule. By the end of November, the cumulative annual output reached 6.16 million tons, exceeding the Five-Year Plan's target of 6 million tons for the final year, more than doubling the 1952 figure before the implementation of the Five-Year Plan.

Ten types of cement that China could not produce or could not produce in large quantities before the implementation of the Five-Year Plan can now be produced or produced in large quantities. These include dam cement prepared for the Sanmenxia and other water conservancy and power station projects, white cement for manufacturing various gorgeous artificial marbles, high-alumina cement that can generate a large amount of heat suitable for winter construction, rapid-hardening cement with a setting time several times faster than ordinary cement suitable for rush projects, as well as sulfate-resistant cement for building underground dams and basements, plugging cement for making oil well walls, and high-strength No. 700 cement and non-shrinking, impermeable cement.

Of the 3.47 million tons of cement produced more this year than in 1952, 70% was due to increased production from improved production equipment and the promotion of advanced experience. The Ministry of Building Materials Industry has widely promoted the advanced Soviet experience of using blast furnace slag left over from iron smelting and shale discarded from coal mines as cement mixtures, which are mixed with cement clinker calcined in rotary kilns. This can increase cement production by more than one million tons per year, equivalent to the annual output of three new large cement plants, and can transform ordinary cement into cement with different properties and strengths. Due to the promotion of the advanced experience of rapid rotary kilns, the average speed of cement kilns under the Ministry of Building Materials Industry has increased by more than 20% per hour compared to 1952, thereby increasing output by 20%-30%. In the year before the Five-Year Plan, cement kilns under the Ministry of Building Materials Industry had to be repaired on average about every thirty days. This year, most of the kilns under this ministry can operate for about one hundred days. One of the largest cement plants in the country, the No. 1 kiln of the Jiangnan Cement Plant, has been operating safely for 684 days as of December 15, setting a national record for safe operation, and is still in operation. Extending the life of each kiln can produce a lot more cement.

Of the twelve cement plants newly built, restored, and expanded under the First Five-Year Plan, five have already been put into production. Another newly built Datong Cement Plant in Shanxi Province with an annual output of 450,000 tons has been basically completed and is currently in trial production.

### 我国水泥产量提前完成五年计划  年产量超过六百万吨，许多特种水泥已能制造

    我国水泥产量提前完成五年计划
    年产量超过六百万吨，许多特种水泥已能制造
    新华社18日讯　我国的水泥产量提前一年零一个月完成了五年计划，到11月底，累计年产量达六百一十六万吨，超过五年计划最后一年六百万吨的指标，比五年计划执行前一年的1952年增加了一倍多。
    执行五年计划以前我国不能生产或不能大量生产的十种水泥，现在已经能够生产或大量生产。其中有准备供三门峡等水利和发电站工程用的大坝水泥，制造各种华丽的人造大理石用的白色水泥，有可以发生很大热量适于冬季施工的高铅水泥，有比一般水泥凝固期快几倍适于抢工期的快硬水泥，还有修建地下水坝和地下室用的抗硫酸盐水泥，做石油井井壁等用的堵塞水泥，以及强度很大的七百号水泥和不收缩不透水水泥等。
    今年我国比1952年多生产的三百四十七万吨水泥中，有70％是由于改进生产设备和推广先进经验而增产的。建筑材料工业部普遍推广了苏联先进经验——利用炼铁剩下的矿渣和煤矿抛弃的页岩等废物，作为水泥混合料，同经过回转窑煆烧的水泥熟料掺合在一起，这样每年就可以增产一百多万吨水泥，等于新建三个大型水泥厂的年产量，而且可以变普通水泥为不同性能不同强度的水泥。由于推广了快速转窑的先进经验，建筑材料工业部所属的水泥窑每小时转的速度，平均比1952年快了20％以上，从而使产量增加了20％—30％。五年计划前一年，建筑材料工业部所属的水泥窑平均要三十天左右检修一次，今年这个部的大部分窑能运转一百天左右。全国最大的水泥厂之一——江南水泥厂一号窑，到12月15日止，已经运转了六百八十四天，创造安全运转全国最高纪录；现在还在运转着。每座窑的寿命延长，就可以多生产很多水泥。
    第一个五年计划规定新建、恢复和扩建的十二个水泥厂，有五个已经投入生产。另一座新建的年产四十五万吨的山西省大同水泥厂，已经基本建成，目前正在试生产。
