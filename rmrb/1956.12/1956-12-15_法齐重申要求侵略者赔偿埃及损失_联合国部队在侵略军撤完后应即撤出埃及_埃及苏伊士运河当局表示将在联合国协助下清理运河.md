    Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, Washington Dispatch: Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi delivered a speech at the National Press Club on the 13th in the United States, reiterating Egypt's demand for compensation for the enormous losses it suffered in the war.
    Fawzi said: "There has been much talk and continued talk about helping the aggressors and rescuing them from irresponsible adventures, but hardly anyone has talked or written about compensating Egypt for the damage it suffered and eliminating the destruction it endured… The enormous losses suffered by Egypt and the Egyptian people should be given fair and just compensation."
    Fawzi also reiterated that the Egyptian government believes that once the Anglo-French-Israeli forces have completely withdrawn, the United Nations International Police Force should withdraw from Egypt immediately. He said that the main concern of Egypt at present is to repair the damage done to the canal. Preparations for clearing the obstacles in the Suez Canal "have long been underway." He also said that "the Egyptian government hopes that the Suez Canal will return to the state it was in before the aggression."
    In response to another question, he said that the Egyptian government has always been willing to discuss the entire Palestinian issue in the United Nations in order to seek a fair solution.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 14th, Cairo Dispatch: Younis, the Director of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority, said on the 13th: "The Egyptian Suez Canal Authority is technically capable of clearing the canal." He also said that the Authority will carry out the work of clearing the canal with the assistance of the United Nations.
    Younis made these remarks to reporters on the 13th after meeting with President Nasser. He said: "It is difficult to say at present how long it will take to clear the canal, because the extent of the damage to the canal cannot be estimated before the enemy withdraws."
    Since the 12th, Younis has also held several talks with Wheeler, the UN representative responsible for assisting Egypt in clearing the Suez Canal.

    法齐重申要求侵略者赔偿埃及损失
    联合国部队在侵略军撤完后应即撤出埃及
    埃及苏伊士运河当局表示将在联合国协助下清理运河
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：埃及外交部长法齐13日在美国全国新闻俱乐部发表演说，重申埃及要求赔偿它在战争中遭受的巨大损失。
    法齐说：“关于帮助侵略者和把他们从不负责任的冒险行动中拯救出来的事已经谈论了很多并且还在继续谈论，可是几乎没有人谈到或写到补偿埃及所遭到的损害和消除它所受到的破坏。……埃及和埃及人民所遭受的巨大损失应该给予公平和正当的赔偿。”
    法齐还重申：埃及政府认为，一旦法英以军队撤退完毕，联合国国际警察部队应当立即撤出埃及。他说，当前埃及关心的主要问题是修复运河遭到的破坏。关于清除苏伊士运河中的障碍物的准备工作“早已在进行”。他并且说，“埃及政府希望苏伊士运河恢复到遭受侵略以前的地位”。
    他在答复另外一个问题时说，埃及政府始终愿意在联合国中讨论整个巴勒斯坦问题，以谋求一个公平的解决办法。
    新华社14日讯　开罗消息：埃及苏伊士运河管理局局长尤尼斯13日说：“埃及苏伊士运河管理局在技术上有能力清理运河。”他又说，管理局将在联合国协助下来进行清理运河的工作。
    尤尼斯是在13日同纳赛尔总统会谈后对记者说这些话的。他说：“目前很难说清理运河需要多长时间，因为在敌人撤退前不能估计运河受到损坏的程度。”
    从12日以来，尤尼斯又同负责协助埃及清理苏伊士运河的联合国代表惠勒进行了几次会谈。
