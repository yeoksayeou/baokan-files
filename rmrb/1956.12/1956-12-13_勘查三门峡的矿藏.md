    Surveying the Mineral Resources of Sanmenxia
    The Sanmenxia on the Yellow River not only has huge hydropower resources, but also abundant mineral resources.
    On both sides of the Sanmenxia, especially in the area of ​​Pinglu County, gypsum mines have been mined for hundreds of years. Mineral outcrops have been exposed in the Zhongtiao Mountain area. However, no one cares about this rich gypsum mine, and people in some places have to use it to build walls.
    The reserves of bauxite around Sanmenxia are also very large. According to the engineers of the Sanmenxia Geological Exploration Team: "In the geological and hydrogeological surveys in the past few years, many bauxite deposits have been found in Sanmenxia. Near Huixing Town, there are several meters to more than ten meters thick bauxite deposits between the coal seams."
    However, these rich mineral resources have not attracted the attention of relevant departments. Therefore, I suggest that relevant departments should dispatch a group of people as soon as possible to cooperate with the Sanmenxia dam site and reservoir survey to conduct a general survey to find out the amount of mineral deposits and develop and utilize them.

    勘查三门峡的矿藏
    黄河三门峡，不仅有着巨大的水力资源，而且矿藏也很丰富。
    在三门峡两岸，特别是平陆县一带的石膏矿，早在几百年前就有人开采了。中条山一带都已露出了矿苗。但是这个丰富的石膏矿无人过问，有的地方的群众只好用它来砌墙。
    在三门峡周围的铝土矿蕴藏量也很大，据三门峡地质勘探队的工程人员说：“在几年的地质与水文地质勘查中，在三门峡发现很多铝土矿，在会兴镇附近，各个煤层间都藏有几公尺到十几公尺厚的铝土矿。”
    但是，这些丰富的矿藏却没有引起有关部门的注意。因此我建议有关部门尽快抽调一批人员，配合三门峡坝址及水库勘察，进行一次普查工作，弄清矿藏量，并加以开采和利用。　张国维
