Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation convened a rural women's work symposium in Beijing from the 15th to the 25th.

    The meeting focused on discussing issues such as the rational allocation of rural women's labor.

    During the discussions, everyone unanimously agreed that the achievements made by women in agricultural production this year are significant. The number of women participating in production has greatly increased, the scope of labor has expanded, attendance rates have generally improved, and a large number of female backbones and production experts have emerged. The family and social status of women has also been greatly improved as a result. However, on the other hand, the problem of overusing and overburdening women's labor has occurred in women's participation in production. In some areas, there is also a phenomenon of idle female labor. The symposium believes that in order to make full and appropriate use of women's labor, effectively tap women's labor potential, protect women's health, and take care of the family life of cooperative members, women's federations in various places must first cooperate with relevant departments to assist agricultural cooperatives in planning and rationally allocating the use of female labor, correcting the bias of simply emphasizing mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production and demanding excessively high labor quotas for women, without considering women's physiological and physical characteristics and the actual situation of household labor. Women's federations in various places should also assist agricultural cooperatives in organizing women to participate in diverse agricultural and sideline production, and based on the needs of completing national and agricultural cooperative production increase plans and increasing the income of cooperative members, proceed from the actual possibilities of women and use women's labor in positions where they can play the most effective role. Women who have achieved excellent results in agricultural and sideline production, and those who shoulder heavy household labor while managing it well, should be encouraged and commended.

    At the symposium, everyone also believed that in order to fully mobilize women's enthusiasm for production, women's federations in various places must promote agricultural cooperatives to continue to implement the policy of equal pay for equal work and gradually overcome unreasonable phenomena such as discrimination and suppression of women's labor remuneration.

    When discussing improving the work of grassroots rural women's organizations, the symposium studied the work content, organizational forms, and work methods of grassroots women's organizations based on the new situation after rural cooperativization.

    The symposium finally discussed strengthening the training of female backbones in agricultural cooperatives. Everyone believes that in the future, in accordance with the spirit of the central government's instructions, it is necessary to vigorously train female backbones so that each agricultural cooperative can be equipped with female cooperative directors or deputy directors, female team leaders, female group leaders, etc., in order to strengthen the women's work of agricultural cooperatives through them. Women's federations in various places should assist agricultural cooperatives in adopting various methods to train female backbones.

    全国妇联农村妇女工作座谈会提出
    协助农业社合理使用妇女劳力
    据新华社26日讯　中华全国民主妇女联合会15日到25日在北京召开农村妇女工作座谈会。
    会上着重讨论了合理安排农村妇女劳动力等问题。
    在讨论中，大家一致认为今年妇女参加农业生产取得的成绩是很大的，参加生产的人数大大增多，劳动范围已经扩大，出勤率普遍提高，并且涌现了大批的妇女骨干和生产能手。妇女的家庭和社会地位也因而大大提高。但另一方面，在妇女参加生产中，也曾发生了过多过重地使用妇女劳力的问题。有的地区还有闲置妇女劳力的现象。座谈会认为，为了使妇女劳力得到充分而又适当地使用，有效地发挥妇女的劳动潜力，并保护妇女健康，照顾社员家庭生活，各地妇联首先要配合有关部门协助农业社有计划地合理安排使用妇女劳力，纠正不照顾妇女的生理体力特点和家务劳动的实际情况，单纯地强调发动妇女参加农业生产和对妇女劳动指标要求过高的偏向。各地妇联还要协助农业社组织妇女参加多种农业和副业生产，要根据完成国家和农业社的增产计划以及增加社员收入的需要，从妇女的实际可能出发，把妇女劳力使用到最能发挥作用的岗位上去。对于参加农业、副业生产有很好成绩的妇女，和那些负担着繁重家务劳动而又料理的很好的妇女，都应当予以鼓励和表扬。
    在座谈会上大家还认为，为了要充分发挥妇女的生产积极性，各地妇联必须推动农业社继续贯彻同工同酬的政策，逐步克服歧视和压低妇女劳动报酬等不合理现象。
    座谈会在讨论改进农村妇女基层组织工作时，根据农村合作化后的新情况，研究了基层妇女组织的工作内容、组织形式、工作方法等问题。
    座谈会最后讨论了加强培养农业社妇女骨干问题。大家认为今后必须根据中央指示的精神，大力培养妇女骨干，使每个农业社都能配齐女社长或女副社长、女队长、女组长等，以便通过她们加强农业社的妇女工作。各地妇联应协助农业社采用多种办法来训练妇女骨干。
