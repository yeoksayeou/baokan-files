Sichuan Province's Second Women's Representative Congress decided to mobilize women across the province to actively participate in the campaign to increase production and practice thrift.

The congress put forward different demands for increasing production and practicing thrift for women in different regions. In rural areas, the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily should be implemented, the utilization rate and production efficiency of women's labor should be improved, women should be organized to raise more pigs, accumulate more fertilizer, and develop various household sideline occupations. Women in factories, handicrafts, and other production posts should continuously improve labor productivity, save raw materials, and reduce costs. Among the vast number of housewives, the "Five Goods" campaign should be carried out in depth, advocating diligence and thrift in managing the household, careful calculation, and the development of sideline production in various aspects.

At the meeting, fifty-eight women representatives introduced their achievements and experiences in increasing production, practicing thrift, and other work. The congress closed on the 21st.
