    Sweet Potatoes Can Also Be Made into Maltose
    Last month, I came from the countryside of Linli County, Hunan. The farmers in our village are also troubled and worried because of the sweet potato harvest. Eating it as a staple food has already made people dislike it; taking it to the market to sell costs one day of time and only brings in two to three yuan per hundred catties. There are too many people selling sweet potatoes, and the market can't sell them all. They are also sighing at the piles of sweet potatoes. Some farmers in my village have tried using sweet potatoes to make maltose. If this method works, using sweet potatoes to replace part of the grain (we use rice to make maltose there) can reduce grain consumption. The method is: use wheat to generate wheat sprouts, grind them into a thin porridge, then wash the sweet potatoes and cut them into small pieces. Put them into a pot, add a small amount of water, cook the sweet potatoes until soft, and mash them into sweet potato porridge. Add the wheat sprout porridge and mix well (one tael of wheat sprouts is needed for every four catties of sweet potatoes), and cook over low heat. The wheat sprouts act as a ferment in the porridge, transforming the starch contained in the sweet potatoes into sugar. The sweet potato porridge becomes very clear sweet water and residue. After filtering, the residue can be used as pig feed. The filtered sugar-containing sweet water is put into a pot and boiled over high heat, and it becomes very good maltose.　Pang Xingmin

### 甘薯也能制饴糖

    甘薯也能制饴糖
    上月我从湖南临澧县的农村中来，我们乡村中的农民也因为甘薯丰收了发生烦恼和忧愁。把它作正餐吃，已经使人吃得不喜欢；挑往市上去卖，每百斤只能售二元到三元，还要花一天的时间。卖甘薯的多了，市上也销售不了，他们也同样望着甘薯堆叹气。我乡有些农民试用甘薯熬饴糖，这办法如果能行，用甘薯代替一部分粮食（我们那里有用大米制饴糖的），就可减少粮食消耗。办法是：用麦子生成麦芽，磨成稀粥状，再将甘薯洗净切成细小的块子，放到锅中加少量的水，将甘薯煮熟捣碎成甘薯粥，将麦芽粥加入调匀（每四斤甘薯需要麦芽一两），用小火煮。麦芽在粥中起发酵作用，将甘薯所含有的淀粉变化成了糖质，甘薯粥变成很清的甜水和渣滓。经过滤后，渣滓可作猪饲料，滤出的含糖质的甜水，放入锅中用猛烈的火力熬，就成了很好的饴糖。　庞醒民
