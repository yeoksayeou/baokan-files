Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 15th: The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, along with their entourage, arrived in Bangalore, the capital of Mysore State, on December 14th.

The Chief Minister of Mysore State, Nijalingappa, hosted a grand reception at the famous Lal Bagh Gardens that afternoon to welcome the two dignitaries. More than five hundred officials and social celebrities met with the guests.

Speaking at the reception, the Dalai Lama said that he was pleased to see the great progress made by India, the birthplace of Buddha. He said that Buddha "taught us to relieve the suffering of all mankind and wanted us to maintain permanent peace and happiness in the world. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all Buddhists to follow his teachings and strive to further strengthen our religious and cultural relations."

Panchen Erdeni said that commemorating Buddha's Nirvana in India this year will "promote the cause of world peace and prosperity." He said that we must "continue to work for world peace and try to strengthen the friendly relations between India and China."

Before their speeches, the Chief Minister of Mysore said in his welcoming speech that if all countries in the world agreed to Panchsheel, bad things like death and war, conquest and conflict would disappear.

The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni left the Ajanta Caves for Bangalore on December 12th.
