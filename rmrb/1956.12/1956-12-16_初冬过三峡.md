    Early Winter Passage Through the Three Gorges
　　Xiao Qian
    I
    Having heard that the boat would enter the Three Gorges from Fengjie at ten in the morning, I scrambled up a small metal ladder with a piece of dry food in my pocket a little after nine o'clock and stood on the top deck of the boat. From that moment on, I became one with the sky, the water, and the craggy cliffs on both sides, standing there straight until dusk, when I could only hear the chattering of groups of ducks on the river, but couldn't see them, before returning to the cabin. After being buffeted by the early winter river wind for nearly nine hours, my face and the back of my hands felt a little numb and swollen, but what unforgettable nine hours they were! I felt as if I were in an ever-changing dream, or listening to a unrestrained and magnificent symphonic movement: sometimes charming, sometimes majestic; sometimes eerie and oppressive, sometimes dazzling and magnificent.
    The entire river is like a chain of silver links, each link surrounded by towering peaks that block out the sky, each forming a unique world, some oval like a pipa, some long like a shuttle. Entering one link, looking back, you can only see the clouds moving freely against the early winter sky. Below, the peaks stand out, each vying for attention, making it impossible to see how the boat squeezed through the gaps in the mountains. Looking ahead, the mountain mists swirl, and the layers of peaks overlap, some like bamboo shoots or pillars, piercing the clouds, others standing majestically like painted screens, blocking the way. Heaven only knows how the boat will squeeze through the armpits of these giants.
    That two hundred kilometers of waterway, when described in literary works, is like a thrilling play with a bizarre and winding plot. You can never guess how the next act will unfold. The writer's thoughts are so meticulous, yet so abrupt, forcing you to watch it all in one breath.
    After leaving the Three Gorges, I only had the strength to say one sentence: This is truly a masterpiece of nature. At the dinner table, we compared it to the Mississippi and also to the section of the Danube that passes through the Alps. The more we compared, the more we felt the magnificence of our motherland's rivers and mountains, and the more we understood why our poetry and paintings are so bold and magnificent, full of grandeur.

    Before arriving at the Three Gorges, I imagined it as a place with steep cliffs and no sunlight. In fact, the sun, this ingenious lighting master, not only plays hide-and-seek with us constantly as we enter and exit the gorges, but it also casts a golden pillar of light into the deep valleys with towering cliffs, or it hides in the clouds and drapes a light veil through the thin clouds.
    When I was a student, I had long yearned for the clouds of the Three Gorges. Seeing them this time, they were indeed extraordinary. Passing through the Qutang Gorge, the snow on the mountain peaks was almost mixed with the clouds. It was clearly the clouds that were moving, but it felt like the mountain peaks were walking. Passing through the Wu Gorge, the clouds gradually formed into clusters, sometimes gathering and sometimes scattering, like a flock of swans dancing, weaving wonderful patterns in the blue sky. Sometimes the clouds appeared as bundles of white ribbons, seeming to use all their light and graceful姿态 to衬托衬托 the surrounding叠起的 重岭.
    Upon first entering the gorge, I felt a sense of awe, like visiting the Eastern Peak Temple, with strange and ugly mountain gods rushing towards me from all directions. The mottled rocks on both sides were like giant beasts lying in wait, or like slumbering giants. Some mountain peaks resembled bats spreading their wings, some like sharp knives upside down, and others like roosters stretching their necks to crow, as if a giant with great power and skill had wielded a massive axe, chopping and hacking to carve out this passage for the river. The rock bodies were sometimes purplish-red, sometimes gray-white mixed with apricot yellow. The famous "Three Rows of Rocks" are light gray with a touch of yellow, resembling three sections of broken walls. The Fairy Peak is apricot-yellow, its shape as sharp as a finger, truly beautiful and moving.
    Although the trees in the mountain valleys were still laden with golden-yellow oranges, snow could be seen on the peaks. It was probably only a thin layer, and after being swept by the wind, it looked like ribs that could be seen faintly from afar. A certain peak in the Wu Gorge had a gray cloud hanging halfway up, making it appear exceptionally heroic. Some mountains also had sparkling waterfalls, winding down like silver ribbons. Others, although only a stream flowing down from a mountain crevice, were transformed into golden chains in the sunset.
    As soon as the boat reached the Kuifu Gorge and saw the Yàn Yù shoal standing in the middle of the river, one could not help but appreciate the treacherousness of the Three Gorges' currents. From then on, such road-blocking reefs continued to appear on the river's surface. The brave people even gave these hidden reefs pleasing names, such as "First Pearl Stone" and "Second Pearl Stone." In addition, countless dangerous shoals lurked in the heart of the river, also with quite beautiful names. In the past, countless lives were buried there. Now, although the river is as narrow as ever, it is as safe as an orderly city. Red buoys float above each hidden reef on the river's surface, and every time the boat navigates to a bottleneck, there is a water gauge station at the mountain corner, with various signs hanging in front, which are probably equivalent to traffic police on land. In shallow areas, there are white navigation-reporting boats that report the water level to passing ships. In the evening, people also drive boats to light the red lights one by one on the river, which reminds me of the streetlights in old Beijing.
    Each time we passed a dangerous shoal, looking down from the ship's side, it always seemed as if ten thousand dragons were rolling in the heart of the river, whirlpools swirling, the ship shuddering. At this time, the wrinkles on the water surface were round like copper coins, chaotic like seaweed, and terrifying like traps. To avoid running aground, sailors wearing life jackets stood on both sides of the bow, constantly testing the water level with a long red and blue pole. All that could be heard was the howling of the wind, the collision of the bow with the rapids, and the shouts of the sailors reporting the water level. At this moment, the bridge must have been very tense.
    The ship sounded its horn again and again. If there was a ship opposite us, it would also sound its horn in response. The ships greeted each other, and then the mountains began to talk to each other as well, their voices distant and deep, as if coming from the depths of the earth.

    初冬过三峡
　　萧乾
    一
    听说船早晨十点从奉节入峡，九点多钟我揣了一份干粮爬上一道金属小梯，站到船顶层的甲板上了。从那时候起，我就跟天、水以及两岸的巉岩峭壁打成一片，直直伫立到天色昏暗，只听得见成群的水鸭子在江面上啾啾私语，却看不见它们的时候，才回到舱里。在初冬的江风里吹了将近九个钟头，脸和手背都觉得有些麻木臃肿了，然而那是怎样难忘的九个钟头啊！我一直都像是在变幻无穷的梦境里，又像是在听一阕奔放浩荡的交响乐章：忽而妩媚，忽而雄壮；忽而阴森逼人，忽而灿烂夺目。
    整个大江有如一环环接起来的银链，每一环四壁都是蔽天翳日的峰峦，中间各自形成一个独特天地，有的楕圆如琵琶，有的长如梭。走进一环，回首只见浮云衬着初冬的天空，自由自在地游动，下面众峰峥嵘，各不相让，实在看不出船是怎样硬从群山缝隙里钻过来的。往前看呢，山岚弥漫，重岩叠嶂，有的如笋如柱，直插云霄，有的像彩屏般森严大方地屹立在前，挡住去路。天又晓得船将怎样从这些巨汉的腋下钻出去。
    那两百公里的水程用文学作品来形容，正像是一出情节惊险，故事曲折离奇的好戏，这一幕包管你猜不出下一幕的发展，文思如此之绵密，而又如此之突兀，它迫使你非一口气看完不可。
    出了三峡，我只有力气说一句话：这真是自然的大手笔。晚餐桌上，我们比过密士失必，也比过从阿尔卑斯山穿过的一段多瑙河，越比越觉得祖国河山的奇瑰，也越体会到我们的诗词绘画何以那样俊拔奇伟。气势万千。
    二
    没到三峡以前，只把它想像成岩壁峭绝，不见天日。其实，太阳这个巧妙的照明师不但利用出峡入峡的当儿，不断跟我们玩着捉迷藏，它还会在壁立千仞的幽谷里，忽而从峰与峰之间投进一道金晃晃的光柱，忽而它又躲进云里，透过薄云垂下一匹轻纱。
    早年读书时候，对三峡的云彩早就向往了，这次一见，果然是不平凡。过瞿塘峡，山巅积雪跟云絮几乎羼在一起，明明是云彩在移动，恍惚间却觉得是山头在走。过巫峡，云渐成朵，忽聚忽散，似天鹅群舞，在蓝天上织出奇妙的图案。有时候云彩又呈一束束白色的飘带，它似乎在用尽一切轻盈婀娜的姿态来衬托四周叠起的重岭。
    初入峡，颇有逛东岳庙时候的森懔之感，四面八方都是些奇而丑的山神，朝自己扑奔而来。两岸斑驳的岩石如巨兽伺伏，又似正在沉眠。山峰有作蝙蝠展翅状，有的如尖刀倒插，也有的似引颈欲鸣的雄鸡，就好像一位魄力大、手艺高的巨人曾挥动千钧巨斧，东斫西削，硬替大江斩出这道去路。岩身有的作绛紫色，有的灰白杏黄间杂。著名的“三排石”是浅灰带黄，像煞三堵断垣。仙女峰作杏黄色，峰形尖如手指，真是奇丽动人。
    尽管山坳里树上还累累挂着黄澄澄的广柑，峰巅却见了雪。大概只薄薄下了一层，经风一刮，远望好像楞楞可见的肋骨。巫峡某峰，半腰横挂着一道灰云，显得异常英俊。有的山上还有闪亮的瀑布，像银丝带般蜿蜒飘下。也有的虽然只不过是山缝儿里淌下的一道涧流，可是在夕阳的映照下，却也变成了金色的链子。
    船刚到夔府峡，望到屹立中流的滟澦滩，就不能不领略到三峡水势的嶮?了。从那以后，江面不断出现这种拦路的礁石。勇敢的人们居然还给这些暗礁起下动听的名字，如“头珠石”，“二珠石”。这以外，江心还埋伏着无数险滩，名字也都蛮漂亮。过去不晓得多少生灵都葬身在那里了。现在尽管江身狭窄如昔，却安全得像个秩序井然的城市。江面每个暗礁上面都浮起红色灯标，船每航到瓶口细颈处，山角必有个水标站，门前挂了各种标记，那大概就相当于陆地上的交通警。水浅地方，必有白色的报航船，对来往船只报告水位。傍晚，还有人驾船把江面一盏盏的红灯点着，那使我忆起老北京的路灯。
    每过险滩，从船舷下望，江心总像有万条蛟龙翻滚，漩涡团团，船身震撼。这时候，水面皱纹圆如铜钱，乱如海藻，恐怖如陷阱。为了避免搁浅，穿着救生衣的水手站在船头的两侧，用一根红蓝相间的长篙不停地试着水位。只听到风的呼啸，船头跟激流的冲撞，和水手报水位的喊声。这当儿，驾驶台一定紧张得很了。
    船一声接一声地响着汽笛，对面要是有船，也鸣笛示意。船跟船打了照呼，于是，山跟山也对语起来了，声音辽远而深沉，像是发自大地的肺腑。
