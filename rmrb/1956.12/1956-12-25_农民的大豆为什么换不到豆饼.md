    Why Can't Farmers Exchange Their Soybeans for Soybean Cake?
    The Jilin Daily published several letters from readers on December 18, all of which demanded that the grain department solve the problem of exchanging soybean cake for soybeans with farmers. The Jilin Daily also published an editorial supporting this demand from the farmers. Farmers in Jilin Province have been forced to painfully feed their livestock with soybeans for a long time because they cannot buy soybean cake. According to the Jilin Daily editorial's estimate, farmers lose three cents for every pound of soybeans they feed compared to feeding a pound of soybean cake. A larger agricultural cooperative would have to reserve about 300,000 jin of soybeans for feed, which would reduce their income by 10,000 yuan. What is even more unreasonable is that on the one hand, because of the soybean shortage, even tofu for human consumption has to be made with soybean cake, but on the other hand, a large amount of soybeans is being fed to livestock. According to the grain department's estimate, from last autumn to now, 80,000 tons of soybeans have been fed to livestock in rural areas (every 100 jin of soybeans fed is equivalent to a loss of more than 10 jin of soybean oil). Therefore, everyone is calling on the grain department to process more soybean cake to supply to rural areas, so that soybeans can be exchanged to extract more soybean oil. However, the Jilin Provincial Grain Department has not resolved this issue.
    Why can't it be resolved?
    The Jilin Provincial Grain Department's answer is: soybean inventories were high in the first and second quarters, so processing was also high; soybean inventories are low in the third and fourth quarters, so processing is also low. However, the grain department's own statistics refute this reason. From the end of September to November 20 this year, the province's soybean inventory surged from more than 18,000 tons to 123,000 tons; while only more than 33,000 tons were processed in the third quarter. At the same time, the amount of soybeans processed this November was also lower than the same period last year. It can be seen that the problem is not a shortage of raw materials, but that processing capacity has not been fully utilized.
    The grain department's other answer is: "The timing of soybean cake production and farmers' needs are contradictory." From the time the grain department purchases soybeans, allocates them for processing, to the time they are transported to rural areas, "it takes at least two months." The Jilin Daily editorial asked: "Can the grain department take various effective measures to save time and solve this problem as much as possible?" The editorial continued: This is entirely possible, the obstacle lies in the grain department's passive attitude towards this issue.
    Then why does the grain department take a passive attitude? The editorial said: It seems that the grain department is afraid that exchanging soybeans will affect the completion of grain procurement tasks. But, "if propaganda and education work and specific organizational work are done well, can we both supply soybean cake and complete the task of grain procurement?" The editorial's answer to this is also affirmative. The editorial requires the grain department to immediately transfer a large amount of existing soybean cake inventory to rural areas to exchange for soybeans, expand processing, so as to gradually increase the allocation of soybean cake to the countryside; in places where soybean cake inventory is insufficient but processing capacity has a surplus, it can also be considered to allow agricultural cooperatives to entrust factories to process soybeans. The editorial also requires the planning department and other relevant departments to jointly help the grain department effectively solve this problem.
    Editor's note: Is the phenomenon of farmers feeding soybeans to livestock unique to Jilin Province? We hope that the leading organs in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, and other soybean-producing areas will also pay attention to this issue; if there is also such a waste of soybeans in your area, we hope that appropriate measures will be taken to change it.

### 农民的大豆为什么换不到豆饼

    农民的大豆为什么换不到豆饼
    12月18日吉林日报上发表了好几封读者来信，这些来信一致要求粮食部门解决用豆饼向农民换大豆的问题。吉林日报并发表社论，支持农民的这一要求。吉林省农民因为买不到豆饼，在好长时期里，一直不得不忍痛用大豆喂牲口。根据吉林日报社论的估计，农民每喂一斤大豆就要比喂一斤豆饼损失三分钱。一个较大的农业社大约要留三十万斤大豆做喂料，这样就要减少一万元的收入。不仅如此，更不合理的地方还在于：一方面，因为大豆不足，连人吃的豆腐也不得不用豆饼制造，可是另方面却让大量大豆被牲口吃掉。据粮食部门估计，从去年秋季到现在，农村里已经给牲口喂掉八万吨大豆（每喂掉一百斤大豆，就等于损失十多斤豆油）。因此，大家一致呼吁粮食部门应该多加工一些豆饼来供应农村，好把大豆换出来，多榨些豆油。但是，这个问题，吉林省粮食厅一直没有加以解决。
    究竟为什么不能解决呢？
    吉林省粮食厅的回答是：一、二季度大豆库存多，加工的也多；三、四季度大豆库存少，所以加工的也少。可是，粮食厅自己的统计数字就驳倒了这个理由。从今年9月末到11月20日，全省库存大豆由一万八千多吨激增到十二万三千吨；而第三季度却只加工了三万三千多吨。同时，今年11月加工的大豆也比去年同期减少了。可见，问题不是原料不足，而加工能力没有充分发挥。
    粮食厅的又一个回答是：“生产豆饼的时间和农民需要集中于一时有矛盾”，从粮食部门购进大豆、调拨加工，到运到农村，“最快也得两个月”。吉林日报社论问道：“粮食部门能不能采取各种有效措施，争取时间，尽可能地解决这个问题呢？”社论接着写道：这是完全可能的，障碍在于粮食部门对这问题采取了消极态度。
    那末粮食部门又为什么采取消极态度呢？社论说：看来粮食部门是怕兑换大豆会影响粮食征购任务的完成。但是，“假如宣传教育工作和具体组织工作做得好，能不能既供应了豆饼，又完成了粮食的征购任务呢？”对于这点，社论的回答也是肯定的。社论要求粮食部门目前就把现有库存豆饼大量调往农村，换回大豆，扩大加工，以便陆续增调豆饼下乡；在库存豆饼不足而加工力量又有剩余的地方，还可以考虑容许农业社拿大豆委托工厂加工。社论还要求计划部门和其他有关部门共同帮助粮食部门切实解决这个问题。
    编者按　农民用大豆喂牲口，这是否仅仅是吉林一省独有的现象？希望黑龙江、辽宁、内蒙古以及其他产大豆的地区的领导机关也注意这个问题；如果当地也有这种浪费大豆的现象，希望采取适当办法加以改变。
