Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: Paris News – U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, who arrived in Paris on the 9th, held talks with British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and French Foreign Minister Pineau separately on the 10th, the day before the opening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, in order to "bridge differences."

According to United Press International, Dulles and Lloyd discussed the clearing of the Suez Canal and "some form of international control of the Suez Canal based on the six principles adopted by the United Nations Security Council in October" during their meeting on the morning of the 10th.

That afternoon, Dulles also met with Pineau. According to Pineau's subsequent remarks to reporters, they discussed "Near East issues and other issues." He said that the "differences of opinion" between him and Dulles were "by no means significant." Pineau stated that both sides had agreed to clear the canal as soon as possible. Pineau said that he and Dulles also discussed the Algerian issue.

Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: New York News – British personnel at the United Nations confirmed on the evening of the 10th that the British Chief Representative to the United Nations, Dixon, disregarding the strong opposition of the Egyptian government, had notified United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld that the British government insisted that the British and French dredging and salvage equipment now in the Port Said area should be used "immediately" to clear the Suez Canal.

Raymond Albert Wheeler, who is in charge of the United Nations' canal clearing plan, said upon arriving in Cairo last week that because the United Nations has sufficient engineering teams to complete all the clearing work, there is no need for British and French salvage equipment to participate.

    杜勒斯同英法外长
    密谋“国际管制”苏伊士运河
    英国驻联合国代表要求用英法设备清理运河
    据新华社11日讯　巴黎消息：9日到达巴黎的美国国务卿杜勒斯，在北大西洋公约组织理事会会议开幕的前一天（10日），分别和英国外交大臣劳埃德、法国外长比诺进行了“弥补分歧”的会谈。
    据合众社报道，杜勒斯和劳埃德在10日上午举行的会谈中，讨论了清理苏伊士运河以及“在10月联合国安全理事会通过的六项原则基础上以某种形式国际管制苏伊士运河”的问题。
    当天下午，杜勒斯又同比诺会谈。据比诺事后告诉记者说，他们讨论了“近东问题和其他问题”。他说，他同杜勒斯的“意见的分歧绝不是很大的”。比诺表示，双方已经一致同意要尽快清理运河。比诺说，他同杜勒斯还讨论了阿尔及利亚问题。
    据新华社11日讯　纽约消息：英国驻联合国人员10日晚上证实，英国驻联合国首席代表狄克逊不顾埃及政府的激烈反对，已经通知联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，英国政府坚持应该“立即使用”现在在塞得港地区的英法两国的挖泥和打捞设备来清理苏伊士运河。
    负责联合国清理运河计划的雷蒙·艾伯特·惠勒上星期在到达开罗时说，因为联合国拥有足够的工程队可以完成全部清理工作，所以不需要英法的打捞设备参加。
