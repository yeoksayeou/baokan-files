Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 13th. Professor Wu Jianzhong and Professor Lin Liangcheng of Fujian Medical College have researched the use of hydrochloric acid and copper chloride solution to kill Oncomelania snails, the intermediate host of schistosomiasis, and have achieved good results.

According to the results of field experiments by the Fujian Provincial Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Institute, spraying a solution of hydrochloric acid and copper chloride at a concentration of 1/1000 on dry, wet, and waterlogged grasslands can kill 94.2% to 98% of Oncomelania snails after 48 hours. It is estimated that using this solution to kill snails will only cost twelve or thirteen yuan per mu of land.

The professors also conducted experimental research on the toxicity of hydrochloric acid and copper chloride solution to other organisms. The results showed that it had little impact on crops, and the sprayed seedlings could still grow normally. Large and small sheep showed no signs of poisoning after eating grass sprayed with this solution, but it could poison fish and insects.

Professor Lin Liangcheng told reporters that they will also test the effectiveness of this solution in killing Oncomelania snail eggs.

    研究杀灭钉螺的新药剂
    新华社福州13日电　福建医学院吴建忠教授和林梁成教授等研究用盐酸和氯化铜溶液杀灭血吸虫中间宿主——钉螺，得到良好效果。
    根据福建省血吸虫病防治所现场试验结果证明：以千分之一浓度的盐酸和氯化铜溶液喷射在干的、湿的和积水的草埔上，四十八小时后能杀灭94.2％到98％的钉螺。用这种药液灭螺，估计每亩面积只要十二、三元就够。
    教授们对盐酸氯化铜药液对其他生物的毒害也作了实验研究，结果证明对农作物的影响少，受喷射的秧苗仍能正常生长；大、小羊吃过喷射这种药液的草没有发现有中毒的病理现象，但能毒死鱼类和昆虫。
    林梁成教授对记者说，他们还将试验这种药液杀灭钉螺卵的效力。
