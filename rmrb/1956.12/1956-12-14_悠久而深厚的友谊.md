The ancient banyan trees, bathed in the winter sun, appeared even greener; it was the best season of the year in India.

The crowd gathered in the center of Calcutta stretched as far as the eye could see. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long were there to meet with more than a million people of Bengal.

From early morning on December 9th, workers, students, women, and farmers from the suburbs streamed in from all directions towards the city center. The hospitable Bengalis, celebrating as if it were a festival, came to participate in the meeting and express their heartfelt welcome to their Chinese friends. People still clearly remembered the unprecedented grand rally held here at this time last year to welcome the Soviet leaders.

Talented Bengali artists specially designed a "chariot of the Sun God" as the rostrum for the meeting. The towering chariot was sculpted with six golden divine horses pulling it in the front and back. The rostrum was surrounded by seven-colored flags, symbolizing rainbows and light. Looking out from the stage over the venue, one could only see a sea of heads, an endless crowd. Seeing this magnificent scene and hearing the thunderous slogans of "Hindi-Chini bhai bhai" from the sea of people, one could not help but feel the great significance of the friendly cooperation between the 400 million people of India and the 600 million people of China.

Mayor Ghosh of Calcutta delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the city's people. Following traditional customs, he presented Premier Zhou with the welcome speech embroidered in gold thread on silk.

The mayor proudly told everyone about the position Bengal occupied in the long history of cultural exchanges between China and India. He said, "More than two thousand five hundred years ago, Bengal and China already had close ties. The people of Bengal received Faxian and Xuanzang at the Nalanda Buddhist Temple and the Tamralipti." He said, "In the reign of Emperor Ming of Han in 67 AD, the Indian scholar Kasyapa Matanga and the outstanding translator Kumarajiva (401 AD), who were invited to China to lecture, were both from Bengal!"

This deep friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, passed down through generations, was the deepest feeling we experienced during the ten-day visit to various parts of India with Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long.

From Bombay on the west coast to Madras in South India, whether in the cities or passing through the countryside, our Indian brothers welcomed us like their own relatives, with lanterns and festoons, cheering on both sides of the road. When Premier Zhou took an open car for a tour in Madras, he constantly stopped to thank the women and children who blocked the road to offer flowers. The long motorcade could only proceed after Premier Zhou got out of the car to accept the garlands and shake hands with them.

On December 7th, Premier Zhou and Vice-Premier He bid farewell to the tranquil and beautiful South India, flew over the vast tropical forest, and arrived at India's most important industrial area at the junction of Bengal and Bihar. Amidst the cheers of thousands of miners, the guests traveled through the rich "Ruhr region of India" by car. They visited the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, one of the major industries established after India's independence. The factory has eight thousand workers and can produce an average of fourteen locomotives per month. Then, in the twilight, Premier Zhou and Vice-Premier He drove over the Maithon Dam on the Damodar River to visit the Sindri Fertilizer Factory, sixty miles away. All the large and small villages and towns the car passed through had red cloth arches erected, with banners written in Chinese with the slogan "Long Live Sino-Indian Friendship." Many buildings were decorated with colored light bulbs, shining brightly. Farmers and miners crowded on both sides of the road with their lanterns, waving and cheering to Premier Zhou.

The state-owned Sindri Fertilizer Factory is one of the largest in Asia. Towering chimneys constantly spewed out roaring flames, illuminating half the sky red. The factory produces nearly a thousand tons of chemical fertilizers every day, saving more than 100 million rupees in foreign exchange previously spent on importing fertilizers, and the fertilizers produced can increase grain production by 2.4 million tons.

This industrial area left a deep impression on the Chinese guests. It contains 85% of India's total coal reserves. Iron, copper, aluminum and other mineral resources are also abundant. However, during the more than two hundred years of British rule, India had no industry of its own, and the local residents - the Santhal people - were employed by the British as cheap labor. Now, these people, who were enslaved not long ago, are working in their own factories to develop India's economy.

People still remember that the early history of Bengal and British colonialists' invasion of India are closely linked. The East India Company's frenzied plunder of India based in Bengal still leaves India with deep wounds. Indian friends told us during the trip that one-third of the residents of Bengal and Bihar starved to death in the great famine of 1770. Prime Minister Nehru, in his book "The Discovery of India," indignantly accused the colonialists of how they caused "thousands upon thousands of people to fall dead in front of the luxurious buildings of Calcutta."

However, the days of colonialism are gone forever, and the great India has taken its national destiny into its own hands. On the afternoon of Premier Zhou's arrival in Calcutta, Chief Minister Roy of West Bengal specially accompanied him to the thirteenth floor of the newly completed state government building to overlook the city. In the setting sun, he pointed to the banks of the Hooghly River and said to Premier Zhou with boundless emotion: "That is where the British occupied in those years!"

The British-style buildings and the iron bridge over the Hooghly River in Calcutta reminded me of my feelings when I looked out over the Huangpu River and People's Square from the top of the Shanghai International Hotel. This feeling of "standing up" was like a warm current. When I told the Indian official next to me about this feeling, we shook hands tightly in unison!

"Yes, we are clearing away the legacy of colonialism," he said. "Although things are proceeding slowly, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has passed a resolution to abolish the British street names in the city." He pointed to some statues nearby and told me that not long ago, these "big shots" famous for invading India had been smeared with black oil by patriotic youths!

Premier Zhou said at the welcoming rally of a million citizens in Calcutta: "During this visit, we have deeply realized the necessity of close cooperation and mutual learning between our two great countries. Our two countries face many similar problems. Although we have freed ourselves from the enslavement of colonialism, we have not completely eliminated the scourge left to us by colonialism. We must not only cherish and safeguard the political independence we have achieved, but also urgently develop our own economy and culture, and build our respective motherlands. In our respective efforts to build our motherlands, our experiences are very worthy of our mutual learning and mutual reference."

Premier Zhou Enlai loudly spoke the voice in the hearts of the Chinese and Indian people: "Hindi-Chini bhai bhai!" (Attached picture)

    悠久而深厚的友谊
    新华社记者　孔迈
    古老的榕树沐浴着冬日的阳光，显得更加翠绿，这是印度一年中最好的季节。
    聚集在加尔各答市中心广场上的人群，一眼望不到边。周恩来总理、贺龙副总理就在这里和一百多万孟加拉人民会面。
    12月9日，从清早起，工人、学生、妇女和郊区的农民就成群结队地开始由四面八方涌向市中心。热情好客的孟加拉人，像庆祝节日一样来参加大会，向中国朋友表示衷心的欢迎。人们还清楚地记得，去年这个时候也在这里举行过空前盛大的集会，欢迎过苏联领袖。
    多才的孟加拉艺术家们特地设计了一座“太阳神的战车”作为大会的讲台。高耸的战车前后塑有六匹金色的神马牵引着它。讲台周围竖立着七色旗帜，象征彩虹和光明。从台上眺望会场，只见万头攒动，人群无边无际。看到这种伟大的场面，听到人海中发出来的“印地秦尼巴依巴依”的雄壮口号声，使人由衷地感到四万万印度人民和六万万中国人民的友好合作有着多么重大的意义。
    加尔各答市长高士代表全市人民宣读了欢迎词。他按照传统的仪式，把用金线绣在绢绸上的欢迎词献给周总理。
    市长充满自豪地告诉大家，孟加拉在中印两国悠久的文化往来历史上所占的地位。他说，“二千五百多年以前，孟加拉和中国就已经有了密切的往来。孟加拉人民在那烂陀佛教寺和丹姆拉里布梯接待了法显和玄奘”。他说：“公元67年，在汉明帝时代应邀到中国讲学的印度学者摄摩腾和杰出的翻译家鸠摩罗什（公元401年）都是孟加拉人！”
    中印人民之间这种世世代代的深厚的友谊，正是我们随同周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在印度各地十多天访问中最深的感受。
    从西海岸的孟买到南印度的马德拉斯，不论是在城市里或者是路过乡村，我们的印度兄弟都像迎接自己的亲人一样，张灯结彩，夹道欢呼。周总理在马德拉斯乘敞篷车出外参观时，不断地为答谢拦道献花的妇女儿童们而停下来。长长的车队只有在周总理走下车来接受了花环并且同他们握了手以后才能继续前进。
    周总理和贺副总理在12月7日告别了恬静美丽的南印度，飞越广大的热带森林，来到孟加拉和比哈尔邦交界处的印度最重要的工业区，客人们在数千矿工的欢呼声中乘车在富饶的“印度鲁尔区”行进。他们参观了印度独立后建立的大工业之一——奇塔兰詹机车制造厂，这个工厂有八千工人，每月平均可以生产十四部机车。接着，在暮色苍茫中，周总理、贺副总理又驱车越过达莫他河上的迈顿水闸到六十英里以外的辛德利肥料厂参观。车子经过的所有大小乡村和市镇都搭起红布牌楼，牌楼上挂着用中文写的“中印友好万岁”的横幅标语。许多建筑物都用彩色灯泡装饰得十分灿烂辉煌。农民和矿工们打着马灯挤在道路两旁向周总理招手欢呼。
    国营的辛德利肥料工厂的规模是亚洲数一数二的。耸入云霄的大烟囱，不时喷吐出熊熊的火焰，把半壁天空照得通红。这个工厂每天生产着近千吨化学肥料，每年可以节省过去向国外购买肥料的外汇一亿卢比以上，生产的肥料可以增产粮食二百四十万吨。
    这个工业区给中国客人们留下了深刻的印象。这里蕴藏着占整个印度85％的煤。铁、铜、铝等矿产也很丰富。但是在英国统治下的二百多年间，印度没有自己的工业，当地居民——山达族便是英国雇用廉价劳动力的对象。现在，这些不久前被奴役的人们，在印度自己的厂房里为发展印度的经济而工作着。
    人们还记得，孟加拉和英国殖民者早期侵占印度的全部历史是密切联系着的。东印度公司以孟加拉为基地对印度的疯狂掠夺，至今还给印度留下了深痛的创痕。印度朋友在旅途中告诉我们，孟加拉和比哈尔的居民有三分之一是在1770年大饥荒中饿死的。尼赫鲁总理在他写的“印度的发现”那本书中，就悲愤地控诉了殖民者如何使“成千成万的人民在加尔各答的豪华的建筑物前面倒地死去”。
    但是，殖民主义者的日子是一去不复返了，伟大的印度已经把国家命运掌握在自己手里了。西孟加拉邦首席部长罗伊在周总理到达加尔各答的当天下午，特地陪他登上新近落成的邦政府大厦的十三层楼眺望全市景色。在夕阳下，他指着呼格利河畔无限感慨地告诉周总理：“那里就是当年英国占领的地方！”
    加尔各答英国式的高楼和呼格利河上的铁桥使我不禁想起了在上海国际饭店顶层了望黄浦江和人民广场时的心情。这种“站起来了”的感觉像一股热流，当我把这种感觉告诉身旁的印度官员时我们不约而同地紧紧握起手来！
    “是的，我们正在扫除殖民主义的遗毒。”他说，“虽然事情进行得很慢，但是，加尔各答市政委员会已经通过决议废除市内的英国街名”。他指着附近的一些塑像告诉我，不久以前，这些因侵略印度而有名的“大人物”曾被爱国青年涂上了黑油！
    周总理在加尔各答百万市民欢迎大会说：“在我们的这次访问中，我们更加深深地体会到我们两个伟大的国家亲密合作和互相学习的必要。我们两国面临着许多相似的问题。我们虽然摆脱了殖民主义的奴役，但是，我们却没有完全消除殖民主义所遗留给我们的祸害。我们不仅要珍贵和维护我们已经取得的政治独立，而且迫切地要求发展我们自己的经济和文化，要求建设我们各自的祖国。在我们各自建设祖国的努力中，我们的经验是十分值得我们互相学习和互相参考的。”
    周恩来总理响亮地说出了中国和印度人民心底的声音：“印地秦尼巴依巴依！”（附图片）
