Xinhua News Agency, London, April 4th: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd announced in the House of Commons on December 3rd: "The French and British governments have come to the conclusion that they can now withdraw their forces from the Port Said area without delay."

Lloyd said: "The two governments have instructed General Keightley, commander of the Allied forces, and General Burns, commander of the United Nations forces, to reach an agreement on a timetable for the withdrawal after considering relevant military and practical issues." He said: The "timetable" for the withdrawal will be submitted to the United Nations Secretary-General as soon as possible, "and as long as all parties are sincere, the withdrawal can be completed in the short term."

These words were announced by Lloyd near the end of a lengthy statement regarding the British government's decision to withdraw British troops. Although the statement did not specify an exact date for the completion of the withdrawal, it already indicates the bankruptcy of the Anglo-French military aggression policy against Egypt.

Lloyd's Remarks Widely Mocked

In his statement, Lloyd futilely defended the government's aggressive policy, saying that the British military action had achieved three objectives: preventing a local war, promoting the establishment of a United Nations international force to prevent war from recurring, and exposing the Soviet Union's "threat" to the region. As he said this, the House of Commons erupted in prolonged laughter.

While announcing the British withdrawal decision, the Foreign Secretary also mentioned a series of British government demands and conditions. He said that the Allied commander had been instructed to ensure "the security of the areas under Allied control" during the "preparation of the timetable;" he had also requested the United Nations commander to be responsible for protecting "the safety of British and French salvage materials." He also said that in order to ensure the rapid clearing of the canal, "some non-combatant salvage ships of the British Navy will remain."

Lloyd also advocated for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Egyptian territory and from the Gaza Strip, but he said that the withdrawn areas "should be placed under the responsibility of the United Nations." When he spoke of the "long-term solution" to the Middle East issue, he stated that "the presence of United Nations forces in this region will help achieve a final solution."

House of Commons Echoes with Calls for Resignation

Regarding the future of the Suez Canal, Lloyd said that the British government insisted that an agreement be reached through negotiations, provided that appropriate guarantees were given for the six requirements passed by the Security Council on October 13th. During the negotiations, the presence of an international force in the canal area would be of "utmost help" to the negotiations.

Lloyd emphasized that the actions taken by the British government against Egypt "have created conditions that can hopefully lead to a broader solution." As he said this, people laughed loudly. When Lloyd finished speaking and sat down, people repeatedly shouted "Resign!"

Labor Party foreign affairs spokesman Bevan, following Lloyd, said: "We are very happy to hear, and the whole country and the world are also very happy to hear, that the French and British governments have finally decided to withdraw their troops from Egypt. They are doing so very reluctantly and under great pressure, but the decision has finally been made."

Bevan said amidst uproarious laughter: "We sympathize with the Foreign Secretary, who has to sound the bugle of advance to cover his retreat."
     "I have noticed that the government is clearly embarrassed, and I think that if I continue, I will become a rogue."

Labor MP Denzil Davies asked Lloyd if the statement he read had been discussed with Eden. Lloyd said: The content of the statement had been sent to Eden that day, and Eden, who was recuperating in Jamaica due to "excessive fatigue," "fully agreed with the policy announced today."

Pinot Reads Letter Listlessly

Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: Paris dispatch: During the French National Assembly's discussion of the budget on the 3rd, Foreign Minister Pinot interrupted to read aloud the full text of two letters from the British and French governments to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. The content of these two letters was jointly agreed upon by Pinot and representatives of the British government last weekend.

Pinot read the letters listlessly, saying that the French and British governments, in view of the fact that an effective United Nations international force had arrived in the Suez Canal area, agreed to withdraw their troops. They hoped that the United Nations Secretary-General would convene negotiations on the future status of the Suez Canal as soon as possible, based on the six principles passed by the United Nations on October 13th. At the same time, the two countries requested the Secretary-General to ensure the fastest possible clearing of the canal, and expressed their willingness to allow their military personnel to participate in the clearing of the canal.

When discussing the negotiations related to the future status of the canal, the letters indicated that France and Britain were still attempting to implement the so-called "international management" plan for the Suez Canal. It said that the British and French governments believed that, in addition to the six principles adopted by the Security Council, the proposals put forward by Britain and France to the Security Council should also be considered. This proposal required the "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" for "international control" of the canal or a proposal equivalent to this proposal. They also requested direct negotiations between the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Egypt.

Approximately one hundred and thirty deputies sparsely scattered throughout the seats and a small audience in the audience treated Pinot's statement with indifference. After his speech, there was not even polite applause.

Pinot concluded by saying that the National Assembly would hold a foreign policy debate on December 18th.

### 侵埃政策破产　英法宣布撤军  但仍坚持国际管制和参加清理运河

    侵埃政策破产　英法宣布撤军
    但仍坚持国际管制和参加清理运河
    据新华社伦敦4月电　英国外交大臣劳埃德12月3日在下院宣布：“法国和英国政府已经得出结论：现在可以毫不拖延地撤出它们在塞得港地区的部队了。”
    劳埃德说：“两国政府已经命令联军司令凯特莱和联合国部队司令伯恩斯在考虑有关的军事和实际问题以后，再就撤退时间表问题取得协议。”他说：关于撤军的“时间表”将尽速向联合国秘书长提出，“只要各方面都有诚意，撤军工作可以在短期内完成。”
    这些话是劳埃德在关于英国政府决定撤出英国部队的长篇声明快要结束的时候宣布的。虽然声明并没有具体谈到完成撤军工作的确切日期，但是，这已经表明英法对埃及的军事侵略政策的破产。
    劳埃德一席话大受嘲笑
    劳埃德在声明中徒劳地为政府的侵略政策辩护，说什么英国军事行动已经达到了制止一次局部战争、促使联合国成立国际部队以防止战争再起和揭露苏联对这个地区的“威胁”这三项目的。当他这样说的时候，下院发出了经久不绝的嘲笑声。
    这位外交大臣在宣布英国撤军决定的同时，又谈到了一系列英国政府的要求和条件。他说，已经指示联军司令在“拟制时间表的期间”保证“联军控制下的地区的安全”；也已经要求联合国军司令负责保护“英国和法国打捞物资的安全”。他还说，为了保证迅速清理运河，“英国海军的一些非战斗打捞舰将留下来”。
    劳埃德还主张以色列部队撤出埃及领土和撤出加沙地带，不过他说，撤出的地带“应当交由联合国负责”。他谈到中东问题的“长远解决”时，表示“联合国部队驻在这个地区将会有助于获致最后的解决。”
　　下院一片要求辞职的叫声
    关于苏伊士运河前途问题，劳埃德说，英国政府坚持要在安理会10月13日通过的六项要求有适当保证的情况下通过谈判来达成协议。而在谈判期间，一支国际部队驻在运河地区将对谈判起“最大不过的帮助”作用。
    劳埃德强调英国政府对埃及所采取的行动“已经创造了可以希望取得更广泛的解决的条件”。当他说到这里的时候，人们高声大笑。当劳埃德发言完毕坐下来的时候，人们纷纷发出“辞职”的叫声。
    工党外交事务发言人比万继劳埃德之后发言说：“我们很高兴听到，全国和全世界也都很高兴听到，法英两国政府终于决定要把它们的军队撤出埃及了。它们是非常勉强地而且是在很大的压力下这样做的，但是决定终于作出了。”
    比万在哄堂大笑声中说：“我们很同情外交大臣，他不得不发出进军的号角声来掩饰他的退却。”
      “我已经注意到政府显然很窘，我认为，如果我再说下去的话，我将成为一个无赖了。”
    工党议员登斯问劳埃德说，他宣读的这个声明有没有同艾登商谈过。劳埃德说：声明的内容曾经在当天送给艾登，由于“过度疲劳”在牙买加养病的艾登“完全同意今天所宣布的政策”。
　  比诺宣读信件有气无力
    新华社4日讯　巴黎消息：在3日法国国民议会讨论预算问题的时候，外交部长比诺插进来宣读了英法两国政府给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的两封信件的全文。这两封信的内容是上周末比诺同英国政府代表共同商定的。
    比诺有气无力地宣读信件说，法英两国政府鉴于联合国有效的国际部队已开到苏伊士运河区，同意撤退自己的军队。它们希望联合国秘书长尽快地在联合国10月13日通过的六项原则的基础上举行关于苏伊士运河将来地位的谈判。同时，两国要求秘书长保证最快地清理运河，并且表示要让它们的军方人员参加清理运河的工作。
    信件中谈到同运河未来地位有关的谈判的时候表示，法国和英国仍然企图实行所谓“国际管理”苏伊士运河的计划。它说，英法政府认为，除了安全理事会通过的六项原则之外，还应该考虑英法向安全理事会提出的提案，这个提案要求通过“国际管制”运河的“十八国建议”或是同这个建议相当的建议。它们还要求英法埃三国外交部长直接进行谈判。
    稀稀落落地散处在议席上的约一百三十个议员和旁听席上不多的听众以冷漠的态度对待比诺的声明。在他发言后，甚至没有发出出于礼貌的掌声。
    比诺最后说，国民议会将在12月18日举行外交政策辩论。
