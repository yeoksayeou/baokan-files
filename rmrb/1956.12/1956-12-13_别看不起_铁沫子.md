    Don't Look Down on "Iron Filings"
    Shavings, also called "iron filings," are waste materials left over from mechanical industrial production. They have a large volume, low weight, are difficult to store, and have a very low price. Many enterprise leaders think they are worthless and often throw them away with dirt and garbage. Even if some enterprises recycle them, they are improperly stored, exposed to wind and rain, and become oxidized and unusable.
    In fact, shavings have great uses and are excellent "recycled iron." This year, Liaoning Province alone produced more than 30,000 tons of "recycled iron" using shavings from Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, Liaoyang, and other places, and the quality is very good. This recycled iron will be equal to 65% of the foundry pig iron allocated to Liaoning Province by the state this year, which has played a significant role in making up for the shortage of pig iron supply. Many industrial and mining enterprises also directly use shavings to melt iron and cast castings, producing small farm tools and iron pots and stoves for cooking.
    It is recommended that the mechanical industry departments strengthen the recovery and storage of iron filings. Kaiyuan

    别看不起“铁沫子”
    刨屑是机械工业生产剩下的废料，也叫“铁沫子”，体积大，重量小，不易保管，价格也很低，很多企业领导认为它不值钱，往往随脏土、垃圾扔掉了。有些企业即使回收了，但由于保管不善，放在露天地里风吹、雨淋，也氧化变质不能使用了。
    其实刨屑用途很大，是很好的“再生铁”，今年辽宁省自沈阳、旅大、鞍山、辽阳等地就利用刨屑生产了三万多吨“再生铁”，质量很好。这些再生铁将等于今年国家分配辽宁省的铸造生铁65％，对弥补生铁供应不足起了很大作用。还有很多工矿企业用刨屑直接化铁浇铸铸件，生产小农具和烧饭用的铁锅、铁炉子等。
    建议机械工业部门能加强铁屑回收和保管工作。　开源
