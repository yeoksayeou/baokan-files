　　A cold wave has arrived in France ahead of schedule. On November 22nd, the temperature in Paris had already dropped below freezing.

　　The severe oil shortage caused by the Mollet government's war of aggression against Egypt has made it impossible for many residences, schools, and public buildings in Paris to obtain liquid fuel for heating; a bleak prospect faces every ordinary Parisian – this winter will be a freezing winter!

　　The oil shortage is not only causing great suffering to the French people, but also a considerable disaster for the French economy.

　　France consumes about 25 million tons of oil annually, but its domestic oil production is only about 500,000 tons, with the rest having to be imported from abroad. More than 90% of imported oil comes from the Middle East, of which 12 million tons are transported through the Suez Canal, and 10 million tons are transported by the Iraq Petroleum Company's pipelines. After Britain and France launched the war of aggression against Egypt, shipping through the Suez Canal was interrupted and oil pipelines were also cut off, so France lost its normal source of oil supply. The amount of oil and petroleum products currently stored in France is very small. French Finance Minister Ramadier admitted that France's oil will run out by mid-December, and gasoline will only last until mid-January next year.

　　In the situation of the oil shortage, the French government has taken measures to restrict car travel, stipulate the maximum limit for residents to store gasoline, and require gas stations to stop supplying oil for 48 hours every weekend, causing widespread panic; but these methods of focusing on restricting personal consumption are of no avail in resolving the serious crisis of the oil shortage. Paris's "International Forum" weekly pointed out: "Personal consumption only accounts for a small part of oil product consumption: less than 15%." The serious consequences caused by the oil shortage will mainly be manifested in industrial production.

　　In French industry, a quarter of the power relies on oil. The main sectors using liquid fuels include metallurgy, chemicals, machinery, cement industry, and power plants. Especially in the glass industry, two-thirds of the furnaces use liquid fuels. In addition, in the railway sector, there are still many locomotives that rely on heavy oil to start. Currently, the French government has reduced the allocation of industrial fuel by one-third, which will greatly affect the production of the above-mentioned industrial sectors.

　　Faced with this situation, the French government, on the one hand, requires industrial sectors to use coal as fuel as much as possible, and on the other hand, actively asks the United States to quickly supply oil. However, there are many difficulties for industrial sectors to use coal instead of oil fuel. In addition to the need to modify power equipment, the supply of coal is not fully guaranteed. As for asking the United States to supply oil, despite the French government's frantic pleas for help, the United States has its own calculations and is reluctant to release oil. In this case, French Finance Minister Ramadier had to sadly say that oil supplied by the Western Hemisphere will not be shipped to Europe in large quantities before January or February next year, so the oil supply situation will not return to normal before the early summer of 1957. There will be a "difficult period" at the beginning of next year.

　　Here, Ramadier's estimate is somewhat overly optimistic. Even if the United States quickly releases oil, it is only a stopgap measure for France and cannot solve the economic difficulties. Because, using American oil will increase the import price of oil by about two times compared to the past, both because of the high price of oil and because of the high transportation costs. In this way, France will have to pay a large amount of extra dollars on oil imports every year, and all industrial products will rise in price accordingly. Moreover, the oil supplied by the United States cannot, in fact, fully compensate for the oil that France has lost in the Middle East. According to the British "Economist" magazine, if France can get 10 million to 12 million tons of oil transported across the Atlantic, that would be very lucky. But this means that France will have to reduce oil consumption by 25% and reduce product production by 5% to 6%.

　　It should also be pointed out that France's military adventure in Egypt not only brought an oil shortage to France, but also put France's foreign trade in a serious crisis.

　　Many important industrial raw materials in France are imported from abroad. The large-scale import of industrial raw materials is a necessary means for France to maintain its current industrial level. However, a large part of the imported raw materials, including more than 95% of tin, more than 95% of jute, 75% of rubber, and 40% of manganese, are transported through the Suez Canal. Now, these raw materials have to come around the Cape of Good Hope, and the import price will be greatly increased. It is estimated that the price of tin and jute will increase by 20%, the price of rubber will increase by 4%, and the price of manganese will increase by 25%. The consequences of these raw material price increases will be an increase in foreign exchange expenditures and an increase in the cost of related industrial products.

　　On the export side, there are also many difficulties. On the one hand, cement, chemical products, heavy machinery, and glass are all important commodities in France's export trade. These industrial sectors are forced to reduce production due to the oil shortage, which cannot but seriously affect the quantity of export commodities. On the other hand, the high cost of export industrial products is a major weakness in France's foreign trade. In the past, successive governments have used a large number of export subsidies to remedy this. Now, the cost of industrial products will be further increased, and the freight of some export commodities will be greatly increased due to roundabout transportation, so France's exports will be in a more unfavorable position in foreign markets.

　　The total value of imports rises, the quantity of exports declines, and the result is naturally a large trade deficit. The trade deficit is a fatal wound to the post-war French economy. In the past two or three years, the situation had improved somewhat, but this year the import surplus figures have increased dramatically again. The French government originally planned to limit the trade deficit to within 280 billion francs in 1956 (only 88 billion francs in 1955), and then strive to reduce it to 175 billion francs in 1957, in order to avoid the crisis of foreign trade balance failing to offset and the depletion of gold and foreign exchange reserves in 1958. However, the bad consequences brought about by launching the war of aggression against Egypt have shattered this plan. In the first half of 1956, the trade deficit was 171 billion francs, in September it increased to 289.7 billion francs, and it has currently exceeded 300 billion francs. As a result, all the gold and foreign exchange reserves in the hands of the French government have declined sharply. At the end of 1955, France's gold and foreign exchange reserves were more than 740 billion francs, but by the end of October this year, it is estimated that there were less than 500 billion francs, a decrease of almost one-third.

　　All of the above, coupled with the heavy military expenditure burden of the wars of aggression against Algeria and Egypt, has put France's finances on the verge of collapse. France's war expenditure in Algeria was initially set at 200 billion francs at the beginning of this year, but in reality, 485 billion francs have been spent. Since France launched the war of aggression in Egypt, the estimated daily military expenditure has been more than 1 billion francs. Therefore, the total fiscal deficit in France this year will exceed 1 trillion francs, an increase of about one-third compared to 1955. In 1957, the serious economic consequences of the military adventure in Egypt will be further manifested, and France's financial situation will inevitably deteriorate further. In order to escape the guilt of launching the war of aggression in front of the people, the French government is trying its best to hide this fact in the 1957 national budget draft recently submitted to the National Assembly. However, this ostrich-like practice cannot deceive anyone at all, and some observers in Paris have pointed out that the total fiscal deficit in 1957 will reach at least 1.5 trillion francs.

　　Faced with a huge fiscal deficit, what will the French government do? This year, in order to raise funds for the Algerian military expenditure, the French government has greatly increased taxes, putting a heavy burden on the working people. The number of public debts has also reached 5,296 billion francs, an increase of more than 560 billion francs compared to the end of 1955. It seems that the most "convenient" way is to issue a large number of banknotes. However, issuing a large number of banknotes is a method of chronic suicide for French finances. At the beginning of October, the amount of banknotes issued in France had reached 2,982 billion francs, an increase of 442 billion francs compared to the end of 1955. French Finance Minister Ramadier also admitted that the number of banknotes issued in France has reached an unprecedented peak. The consequences of malignant inflation cannot but be the devaluation of banknotes. In the second half of this year, the franc has fallen to its lowest price in the free market in three years. On the eve of the start of the new fiscal year at the end of August this year, Mollet loudly called out that the great devaluation of the franc in international currency exchange is one of the three major financial obstacles facing the government. However, France's adventurous policy in Egypt has further aggravated the trend of the franc's devaluation. In just one week from October 26 to November 2, the price of the franc in the free market fell by 3.76%. Obviously, if the French government wants to issue banknotes indiscriminately again, it will only accelerate the collapse of the French economy.

　　French economic figures have been alarmed and uneasy about the bleak prospects for the French economy. The "Echo", reflecting the views of the business community, wrote sadly: "Our economic independence is under threat. The military intervention in Egypt has frustrated our economic independence. In the future, we will be as tightly dependent on the United States as we were in the post-war period, and it will use oil and dollars to control us."

　　In fact, there are still ways for France to save the economic crisis and maintain economic independence. That is: immediately withdraw troops from Egypt and abandon the attempt to infringe on Egypt's sovereignty; quickly stop the "dirty war" in Algeria and resolve the relations between the two countries on the principle of respecting the Algerian people's right to independence; greatly reduce armaments and develop a peaceful economy and equal and free trade. In short, put down the butcher knife and turn back to the shore; France is not without practical lessons. The "dirty war" in Indochina also put the French economy on the verge of collapse, and after the ceasefire in Indochina, the French economy began to improve. Later, because the French government launched a colonial war in Algeria and carried out military intervention in Egypt, the French economy re-tended to deteriorate. Now, does France want to persist in colonialism and drive the economy to a dead end? Or does it hope to get rid of the war of aggression and improve the economic situation? The lessons of the Indochina ceasefire can help every sober-minded Frenchman to make a choice.

　　侵埃战争后的法国经济
　　袁先禄
    寒潮提前来到了法国。11月22日，巴黎的气温已经下降到冰点以下。
    由于摩勒政府发动侵略埃及的战争而造成的严重的石油荒，使巴黎很多住宅、学校和公共建筑取暖用的液体燃料不能得到供应；一个黯淡的前景摆在每一个普通的巴黎人面前——今年的冬天将是一个受冻的冬天！
    石油荒，这不仅给法国人民的生活造成了很大的苦痛，而且对法国经济来说，也是一个不小的灾难。
    法国每年消费石油约二千五百万吨，本国的石油产量只有五十万吨左右，其余的都要从国外输入。进口石油中有90％以上来自中东，其中一千二百万吨是通过苏伊士运河运来的，一千万吨是由伊拉克石油公司的油管输送的。在英法发动侵埃战争后，苏伊士运河航运中断，石油油管也被切断，因而法国失去了石油供应的正常来源。目前法国国内贮存的石油和石油产品数量已经很少。法国财政部长拉马第承认：法国的石油到12月中旬就要用光，汽油也只能用到明年1月中旬。
    在石油荒的情况下，法国政府采取了限制汽车行驶、规定居民贮存汽油的最高限量以及汽车加油站每逢周末停止供油四十八小时等等办法，闹得人心惶惶；但是这种在限制个人消费方面打主意的办法，对于解除石油荒的严重危机是无济于事的。巴黎“国际论坛”周刊指出：“个人消费在石油产品消费中只占一小部分：15％以下。”石油荒所引起的严重后果，主要将表现在工业生产方面。
    在法国的工业中，有四分之一的动力需要依靠石油。使用液体燃料的主要部门，有冶金、化学、机器、水泥工业和发电站等。特别在玻璃工业中，有三分之二的熔炉是使用液体燃料的。此外，在铁路部门，还有很多机车依靠重油来发动。目前，法国政府已经把工业燃料的分配量减少三分之一，这将使以上的一些工业部门生产大受影响。
    面对着这种情况，法国政府一面要求工业部门尽量用煤来作燃料，一面又积极要求美国赶紧供应石油。但是，工业部门要用煤来代替石油燃料，困难是不少的。除了动力设备需要改装以外，煤的供应也并没有充分的保证。至于要求美国供应石油，尽管法国政府奔走呼号，求助情急，美国却有自己的算盘，迟迟不肯拿出石油来。在这种情况下，法国财政部长拉马第不得不凄惨地说：西半球供应的石油不会在明年1月或2月以前大量运到欧洲，因此石油供应情况不会在1957年初夏以前恢复正常。明年年初将有一段“困难时期”。
    这里，拉马第的估计未免是过分乐观了。即使美国很快拿出石油来，对法国来说也只是饮鸩止渴，不能解决经济的困难。因为，用美国的石油，一来由于石油价格高，二来由于运输费用大，石油的入口价格就要比过去提高两倍左右。这样，法国每年在石油进口上就要多付出大量美元，而且一切工业产品将随着涨价。何况，美国供应的石油事实上不能完全弥补法国在中东失去的石油。据英国“经济学家”杂志估计：如果法国能够得到经过大西洋运来的一千万吨到一千二百万吨石油，那就算很幸运的了。但是，这意味着法国要减少25％的石油消耗量和减少5％到6％的产品生产可能。
    还需要指出，法国在埃及进行的军事冒险，不仅给法国带来了石油荒，而且还使法国的对外贸易面临着严重的危机。
    法国很多重要的工业原料是由国外输入的。大量进口工业原料，是法国维持目前工业水平的一个必要手段。但是，进口原料中的很大一部分，其中包括95％以上的锡、95％以上的黄麻、75％的橡胶和40％以上的锰，是通过苏伊士运河运来的。现在，这些原料要绕道好望角而来，入口价格将大大提高。据估计，锡和黄麻的价格将提高20％，橡胶价格将提高4％，锰的价格将提高25％。这些原料涨价的后果，将是外汇支出的增加，有关工业产品成本的提高。
    在出口方面，同样是困难重重。一方面，水泥、化学产品、重型机器和玻璃等，都是法国出口贸易的重要商品。这些工业部门因为石油短缺而被迫缩减生产，就不能不使出口商品数量受到严重的影响。另一方面，出口工业产品成本过高，是法国对外贸易中的一个重大弱点，过去历届政府一直用大量补贴出口的办法来补救。现在，工业产品的成本将进一步提高，一部分出口商品的运费将因为绕道运输而大量增加，因此法国的出口品在国外市场将处于更不利的地位。
    进口总值上升，出口数量下降，结果自然是大量的贸易逆差。贸易逆差，对战后法国经济是一个致命伤。近两三年来，情况曾经有所好转，但是今年入超数字又激剧增加。法国政府原来计划在1956年把贸易逆差限制在二千八百亿法郎以内
  （1955年只有八百八十亿法郎），在1957年再努力减少到一千七百五十亿法郎，以免1958年发生对外贸易收支不能相抵而黄金外汇储备枯竭的危机。但是，发动侵埃战争所带来的恶果，已经把这个计划打得粉碎了。1956年上半年，贸易逆差是一千七百一十亿法郎，9月份增加到二千八百九十七亿法郎，而目前已经超过了三千亿法郎。于是，法国政府手里所有黄金外汇储备就直线下降。1955年底法国的黄金外汇储备数字是七千四百多亿法郎，到今年10月底估计只有不到五千亿法郎，差不多减少了三分之一。
    以上这一切，再加上对阿尔及利亚和埃及进行侵略战争的沉重军费负担，已经使得法国的财政处在崩溃的边缘。法国在阿尔及利亚的战争开支在今年年初规定是两千亿法郎，现在实际上已经花掉了四千八百五十亿法郎。自从法国在埃及发动了侵略战争以来，每天花费的军事费用估计在十亿法郎以上。因此，法国今年的财政赤字总数将超过一万亿法郎，比1955年增加了三分之一左右。在1957年，在埃及进行军事冒险的严重经济后果将进一步表现出来，法国的财政情况势必更加恶化。法国政府为了在人民面前逃避自己发动侵略战争的罪责，在最近向国民议会提出的1957年国家预算草案里正竭力企图隐瞒这个事实。但是，这种掩耳盗铃的做法根本骗不了什么人，巴黎的一些观察家已经指出：1957年的财政赤字总数至少要达到一万五千亿法郎。
    面对着巨大的财政赤字，法国政府将怎么办呢？在今年，为了筹措阿尔及利亚的军费，法国政府已经大量增加了赋税，使劳动人民承受着沉重的负担。公债数字也已经达到了五万二千九百六十亿法郎，比1955年底增加了五千六百多亿法郎。看来，最“方便”的一个办法是大量发行纸币了。但是，大量发行纸币对法国财政说来是一种慢性自杀的办法。10月初，法国的纸币发行量已经达到二万九千八百二十亿法郎，比1955年底增加了四千四百二十亿法郎。法国财政部长拉马第也承认：现在法国纸币发行数量已经到了前所未有的高峰。恶性的通货膨胀所导致的后果，不能不是纸币贬值。今年下半年，法郎在自由市场上已经下降到三年来最低价格。摩勒在今年8月末新的财政年度开始的前夕就大声疾呼道：法郎在国际货币兑换中大大贬值，这是政府面临的三大财政障碍之一。但是，法国在埃及的冒险政策，使得法郎贬值的趋势更加剧了。仅仅在10月26日到11月2日的一个星期中，法郎的价格在自由市场中就下降了3.76％。显然，如果法国政府再要滥发纸币，就只有加速法国经济的崩溃。
    法国经济界人士对于法国经济的阴暗前景已经感到惊惶不安。反映企业界观点的“回声报”悲哀地写道：“我们的经济独立处在威胁中。对埃及的军事干涉使我们的经济独立受到了挫折。今后我们将像战后时期一样紧紧地依赖美国，它将用石油和美元来控制我们。”
    其实，法国要想挽救经济危机、保持经济独立，还是有办法的。这就是：立即把军队撤离埃及，并且放弃侵犯埃及主权的企图；迅速停止阿尔及利亚的“肮脏战争”，根据尊重阿尔及利亚人民独立权利的原则来解决两国的关系问题；大量裁减军备，发展和平经济和平等自由的贸易。总之，放下屠刀，回头是岸；法国并不是没有过实际的教训。印度支那的“肮脏战争”也曾经使法国经济处在崩溃的边缘，而印度支那停战以后法国经济就开始有了好转。后来因为法国政府在阿尔及利亚发动殖民战争，又对埃及进行军事干涉，就使得法国经济重新趋于恶化。现在，法国究竟是要坚持殖民主义而使经济走上绝路呢？还是希望摆脱侵略战争而使经济状况得到改善呢？印度支那停战的教训可以帮助每一个清醒的法国人来进行选择。
