Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 3rd: The International Democratic Women's Federation has issued a declaration on the recent international situation.

The declaration states that the aggression against Egypt, which has created a dangerous hotbed of war in the Mediterranean region, the Hungarian events, which have created the danger of a new conflict in the heart of Europe, and the harmful propaganda campaigns, could all recreate the atmosphere of the "Cold War" and push all of humanity once again towards a world war.

The International Democratic Women's Federation, from the day it was founded, has consistently advocated mutual understanding and friendship, and has made the defense of peace one of its most important tasks. Now it calls on women around the world to strengthen their unity and heighten their vigilance in the struggle against all attempts at division.

The declaration continues by saying that, with the above aims in mind, the International Democratic Women's Federation calls for concrete and rapid measures to limit armaments and ban weapons of mass destruction, as the first step towards comprehensive disarmament.

The International Democratic Women's Federation fully supports the proposal of the Swiss government to convene a meeting of the heads of government of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, and India, and calls on national democratic women's organizations to work more actively to achieve this proposal rapidly and fully, so as to ensure lasting peace, so that every woman and every mother can look forward to the future with confidence.

　　国际民主妇联就国际局势发表宣言
　　支持举行五国会议的建议
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社柏林3日讯：国际民主妇女联合会就最近的国际局势发表了一个宣言。
    宣言说，在地中海地区形成危险的战争祸根的侵犯埃及事件、造成了在欧洲中心产生新冲突的危险的匈牙利事件以及有害的宣传运动，都可能重新造成“冷战”气氛，把全人类再一次推进世界大战。
    国际民主妇联从成立的那天起就始终不渝地主张相互谅解和友好，并且把保卫和平作为自己最重要的任务之一。现在它号召全世界妇女们在反对一切分裂企图的斗争中加强自己的团结和提高警惕。
    宣言接着说，抱着上述宗旨的国际民主妇联，要求采取具体和迅速的措施来限制军备和禁止大规模毁灭性武器，以此作为全面裁军的第一个步骤。
    国际民主妇联全力支持瑞士政府提出的关于召开美、苏、英、法和印度五国政府首脑会议的建议，号召各国民主妇联组织更积极地争取迅速和充分地实现这一建议，以便能保证持久和平，使每一个妇女、每一个母亲都能满怀信心地展望将来。
