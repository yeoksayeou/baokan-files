Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 26th: The newly appointed Japanese Minister of International Trade and Industry, Mikio Mizuta, told reporters yesterday that he hopes to exchange trade delegations with China and to improve the settlement methods between the two countries as soon as possible.

Mizuta met with reporters after yesterday's cabinet meeting. The cabinet meeting discussed policy towards China and decided to promote trade with China.

Mizuta said that the Japanese government will strive to resolve the fingerprinting issue that is hindering the exchange of trade delegations between Japan and China. The so-called fingerprinting issue refers to the Japanese government's previous insistence that members of the Chinese trade delegation stationed in Japan be fingerprinted upon entry.

Mikio Mizuta previously served as Director-General of the Economic Deliberation Agency in the fourth Yoshida Cabinet. Before becoming Minister of International Trade and Industry, he served as Chairman of the Policy Affairs Research Council of the Liberal Democratic Party.
