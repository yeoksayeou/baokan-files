Organizing Pedicabs Brings Many Benefits
　　Zhang Wei

　　Comrades who have been to Wuhan always enjoy talking about Wuhan's pedicabs. They are not familiar with the streets of Wuhan, but as long as they go to the pedicab service station, state a location, and ask for a price, they can get in the car and leave immediately. Once, two comrades went to a school in Wuchang. Because they didn't know the way, they went to hire a pedicab. The pedicab driver pointed his hand and said, "It's just around the corner, no need to hire a car!" This reminds us of an incident before the pedicabs were organized: a comrade who had just arrived in Wuhan got off the train at night and wanted to go to a hotel. The pedicab driver took him around many corners before arriving. He paid the pedicab driver a very high fare, but when he went to the street the next morning, he saw that the train station was right next to the hotel.

　　The new style of Wuhan's pedicabs was formed after they were organized in 1952. They set up more than a hundred service stations at street corners in the city. More than 2,500 pedicabs in the city were parked at the stations in order. Passengers went to the station, stated where they wanted to go, and the service personnel quoted a price according to the unified price list. The passenger got into the first available pedicab and left.

　　Their organization is also very interesting. The service personnel at the service stations are pedicab drivers who take turns, once every five or six days, each time working for three or four hours, which neither increases their economic burden nor affects their work. The pedicab price list was formulated by referring to bus fares and based on the distance, terrain, whether there was luggage, and whether it was on a bus route, after repeated discussions by the workers. The task of the service personnel at the service station is to explain the price to passengers according to the price list and maintain order. At the service stations at various wharves and train stations, they also specially allocate a certain number of pedicabs to pick up passengers according to the arrival time of the vehicles and ships. Sometimes, there are many people and few cars at the entrance of Zhongshan Park on Sundays, so they immediately call other service stations to transfer some cars.

　　Initially, some customers felt it was very inconvenient to hire a car at the service station. At this time, in addition to distributing the stations more reasonably, the pedicab service station also formulated many good methods. For example, for the elderly, weak, pregnant women, patients, or people with luggage, the service station can send the car to their door. In areas with few service stations (such as suburbs), passengers can hitch a ride midway and state the price at the first service station they pass. If there are critically ill patients, the pedicab can also directly take them to the hospital according to the passengers' requests. They also implemented the "reserved car" method. Some time ago, a resident living on Dalian Road in Hankou wanted to board a ship at four o'clock the next morning, so he told the pedicab station attendant the night before and paid the fare. At half past three the next morning, two pedicabs arrived.

　　After the pedicab drivers were organized, most of them established a new service attitude and style. Not long ago, a passenger passing through Wuhan dropped 250 yuan when getting off the pedicab. When he went to the pedicab cooperative to register the loss, he found that the pedicab driver Fu Heshang had already sent the money he had picked up to the cooperative. Recently, when I went to the pedicab cooperative, I also saw more than a dozen large boxes of things piled up there. These were all lost property of passengers handed in by the workers, waiting for the owners to claim them. Because the pedicabs have established a good reputation, some shops, schools, and institutions hand over the scattered delivery orders to the service station, and they send pedicabs to pick up the goods on behalf of the customers. The income of the organized pedicab drivers has increased. Previously, their income was sometimes high and sometimes low, sometimes so low that they could not afford to eat or dress. After the initial organization in 1952, their income was more balanced and increased compared to before. However, because they were responsible for repairing their own cars at that time, they still had to borrow money when they encountered car repairs. In April 1956, they further established a cooperative (members work for themselves, and the tools are their own). The cooperative takes 17% of the members' income to repair the cars, replace the car cushions, issue raincoats, and run some collective welfare undertakings for the members. In this way, the pedicab drivers no longer have to worry about car repairs. Since May 1956, the average monthly net income of the members has gradually increased from more than 40 yuan per person to more than 80 yuan.

    三轮车组织起来好处多
    张碨
    到过武汉的同志，总爱津津有味地谈论武汉的三轮车。他们不熟悉武汉的街道，只要到三轮车服务站说个地点，问个价钱，马上上车就走。有一次，有两个同志到武昌一个学校去，因为不认识路，去雇三轮车，三轮车工人却用手一指：“转弯就是，不用雇车啦！”这却使我们想起三轮车还没有组织起来以前的一桩事：也是一个初到武汉的同志，夜晚下火车后，到一个旅馆去，三轮车拉着他转了许多弯才到，他付给三轮车工人一笔很高的车费，但第二天早晨上街一看，火车站就在这家旅馆旁边。
    武汉市三轮车的新作风，是从1952年组织起来以后才形成的。他们在市内大街小巷口上设立了一百多个服务站，全市二千五百多辆三轮车都分别挨次序停在站上，乘客到站上说出要去的地方，服务员按统一制定的价目表说个价钱，乘客坐上第一辆车就走了。
    他们的组织也挺有意思。服务站上的服务员，是由三轮车工人轮流担任，五、六天轮一次，每次工作三、四小时，既不加重他们的经济负担，也不影响他们出车。三轮车价目表是参考了公共汽车票价，并根据路途远近、地形，有行李没有，以及是否在公共汽车路线上等，再经过工人们反复讨论制定出的。服务站服务员的任务就是根据价目表向乘客说明价钱，维持秩序。他们在各轮船码头和火车站的服务站，还按照车船到达时间，专门调配一定数量的三轮车，接送旅客。有时，星期天的中山公园门口人多车少，他们就马上打电话通知其他服务站调一些车来。
    最初，有些客人因为要到服务站上雇车，感到很不方便。这时，三轮车服务站除了把站分布的更合理外，还订出许多好的办法。例如，对老、弱、孕妇、病人或带有行李的人，服务站可以把车送到他们家门口去。在服务站少的地区（如郊区），乘客可以中途搭车，到路过的第一个服务站再说价钱。如有急病病人，三轮车也能根据乘客要求，直接送往医院。他们还实行了“预约车”的办法。前些时，有个住在汉口大连路的居民，要在次日早晨四点钟上船，头天晚上便告诉三轮车站服务员，并付了车钱，第二天早晨三点半钟，两辆三轮车就到了。
    三轮车工人组织起来后，大部分人都树立了新的服务态度和作风。不久以前，有个路过武汉的旅客，在下三轮车时掉了二百五十元钱，当他到三轮车合作社去登记遗失时，却发现三轮车工人傅和尚早已将拾到的这笔钱送到合作社了。最近，我到三轮车合作社时，还看见在他们那里堆着十几大箱子东西，这些都是工人们交来的乘客的失物，正等着失主来领取。因为三轮车建立了良好的信用，有的商店、学校、机关，便将零星的提货单交给服务站，他们就派三轮车去代客提货。组织起来的三轮车工人的收入增加了。以前，他们的收入时多时少，有时少得吃不上穿不上。从1952年初步组织起来后，他们的收入就比较均衡，而且较前有所增加。不过，因为他们当时是各人负责修理自己的车子，一遇到修车时，还要借债。1956年4月，他们又进一步成立合作社（社员自劳自得，工具为自己所有），社里抽社员所得的17％，替社员包修车子，换车垫，发雨衣，并举办了一些集体福利事业。这样，三轮车工人也不再为修车的事发愁了。从1956年5月以来，社员每月的纯收入，由每人平均四十多元逐步上升到八十多元。
