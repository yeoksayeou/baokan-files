When we visited the Ying County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province, the County Committee was preparing to convene a Standing Committee meeting to discuss and formulate a winter production plan. From the conversations of the County Committee members, it was clear that they had been preparing for this meeting for some time. Zhang Hanqing, the Secretary of the County Committee, told us: "As long as the County Committee members go deep down, they can see far, discover problems early, and the meeting will naturally be successful."

This is true. In order to prepare for the formulation of the winter production plan, the committee members separately solicited opinions from the masses when they went to the countryside during the autumn harvest. After returning, they held symposiums with the participation of the supply and marketing cooperatives, pharmaceutical companies, oil companies, and grain bureaus to find ways to increase production and support the masses in carrying out winter production. Then, they put forward preliminary plans, and after separate deliberation and exchange of opinions, they formally submitted them to the Standing Committee for discussion and approval.

Breaking the "superior-subordinate" relationship between new and old committee members

However, if you want to have a successful County Committee meeting, prior preparation is important, but even more important is to truly promote democracy in the meeting. Like many other counties, this county's committee members have few old County Committee members and many new ones. Of the seventeen County Committee members, only Zhang Hanqing, the Secretary of the County Committee, and Zhang Sijing, the Deputy Secretary, were County Committee members before 1951. The remaining members were promoted after 1954 from district committee secretaries, organizers, secretaries, and cadres. Therefore, the past "superior-subordinate" relationship was naturally brought to the County Committee meeting. The new committee members believed that the others (referring to the old committee members) were old superiors, proficient in work, experienced, and highly skilled, and that they were not as good in all aspects. The old committee members also had a sense of superiority as "old superiors" and sometimes did not show enough humility. As a result, it was not easy to start debates at the County Committee meetings in the past. The old committee members would always talk a lot, while the new committee members would nod in agreement and dare not boldly express their opinions. Sometimes, although some people felt that the old committee members' opinions were not quite right, they did not dare to bring them up because of "face." Even if someone plucked up the courage to raise opposing opinions, other new committee members were afraid of offending the "old superiors" and were embarrassed to clearly express their attitude. In this way, many issues were formally discussed and approved by the County Committee meeting, but were actually decided according to the opinions of a few old committee members. Obviously, in order to give full play to the wisdom of each County Committee member, it is necessary to eliminate the barriers of the "superior-subordinate" relationship that exist in the County Committee. At the County Committee member's life review meeting and the meeting to examine the collective leadership problems of the County Committee held in January, April, and July of this year, the Ying County Committee continuously reviewed and criticized this problem. From the review and criticism, the new committee members realized that: looking at the face of the "old superiors," fearing to offend the "old superiors," and not adhering to principles were actually manifestations of individualistic thoughts that were irresponsible to the Party and the people. The old committee members also reviewed their self-righteous "old boss" style of not paying attention to respecting the opinions of the new committee members, and realized that this style dampened the enthusiasm and initiative of the new committee members and undermined the principle of collective leadership. Since then, this "superior-subordinate" relationship in the County Committee meeting has gradually been broken, and both new and old committee members can freely express their opinions, fully express their opinions, and start debates at the County Committee meeting until the issues under discussion are clarified and decisions are made.

Seriously study the opposing opinions of a few people

It is often the case that when opposing individual and minority decision-making and emphasizing collective discussion and decision-making, the opinions of a few people - especially opposing opinions - are not valued. This phenomenon also occurred in the process of strengthening collective leadership in Ying County. They thought that the opinions of the majority were always more correct than the opinions of the minority, and felt that it didn't matter whether or not they listened to the opinions of the minority. Sometimes, they were even afraid that a few people would raise opposing opinions, which would make the problems too divergent and difficult to unify, and lengthen the meeting time. In this way, democracy was suppressed, and the few people with different opinions could not speak freely. Are the opinions of a few people really not worth paying attention to? Actually not. The opinions of a few people can sometimes be correct. Take the discussion of expanding the corn planting area this spring as an example: At that time, most of the County Committee members, based only on the fact that a few villages had increased production by planting corn, believed that it was no problem to expand the corn to 160,000 mu. A few County Committee members analyzed the county's soil, climate, technology, and other conditions, and raised different opinions. However, because this was the opinion of a few people, it was rejected at that time without careful consideration. As a result, more than 20,000 mu of corn in the county did not mature or did not mature well, resulting in a serious reduction in production. Facts like this deeply educated the County Committee and made them realize that seriously studying the opinions of a few people is helpful for correctly formulating resolutions and correctly solving problems. Even if opposing opinions are wrong, they also help to consider problems from many aspects, improve ideological understanding, and avoid making one-sided mistakes. Therefore, they paid attention to the opinions of a few people later. For example, when discussing the conversion of potatoes into grain recently, most of the committee members advocated that the calculation should still be based on the conversion of four catties of potatoes into one catty of grain last year; a few committee members raised different opinions, believing that this conversion would cause losses to the masses and that it should be based on the actual situation of the region, converting as much as possible, which would not only conform to the policy and take care of the masses, but also encourage the masses to sell more surplus grain. In the end, it proved that the opinions of a few people were correct. In this way, everyone's enthusiasm for participating in collective leadership was further encouraged. Anyone who had different viewpoints, opinions, and suggestions could actively put them forward at the meeting, and start debates and discussions, which made the meeting more lively and made it more certain to make correct resolutions.

Collective leadership should be combined with the mass line

Although everyone dared to say what they thought, because the County Committee members went to the countryside less in the past and did not know much about the actual situation, the meetings were not very lively at the beginning. Especially the committee members who worked in departments such as the Public Security Bureau, the Procuratorate, the Court, and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, could not put forward any specific opinions when discussing the central work, and what they said were also dry, big principles. Therefore, in order to make the meeting better, everyone must understand the actual situation. This requires going deep into reality and deep into the masses, so that collective leadership and the mass line are combined. Therefore, they strongly emphasized the implementation of a regular down-to-earth system for County Committee members. Because each County Committee member went deep into the lower levels, approached the masses, and grasped a large amount of information, they enriched the content of the meeting and greatly improved the quality of the meeting. So that every resolution and plan is formulated on the basis of studying a large amount of information and concentrating the collective wisdom. For example, when estimating the output at the recent meeting, Zhang Hanqing, the Secretary of the County Committee, and Sun Huanting, the Deputy Secretary, only saw that the crops in the good agricultural cooperatives such as Xiashe and Nanmazhuang were growing well, and speculated that the county could produce an average of 130 to 140 catties of grain per mu. Zhang Junxiu, the County Head, and Liu Hanjun, the Minister of Rural Work, ran to many agricultural cooperatives and believed that they could only produce more than 120 catties. After each committee member presented the situation and studied and analyzed it with the County Committee Rural Work Department and the County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, it was finally determined to be 124 catties. This number is in line with the actual situation. At the same time, in order to systematically and deeply understand the work situation and the masses' thoughts, and to make more adequate preparations for correctly formulating resolutions and instructions, they have paid special attention to carrying out planned investigation and research work since this year. For example, the distribution of agricultural cooperatives has been investigated twice in fifteen agricultural cooperatives.

    应县县委解决了集体领导中的三个问题
    何运循　马超骏
    当我们访问中共山西省应县县委会的时候，县委正准备召开常委会议，讨论制定冬季生产计划。从县委委员们的谈话中可以看出，他们对这次会议是早有准备了。县委书记张翰卿同志告诉我们说：“只要县委委员们深入下去，眼睛就能看得远，问题就能早发现，会议自然也就能开得好。”
    这话是实在的。他们为了准备制定冬季生产计划，各委员在秋收下乡的时候就分头征求了群众的意见，回来后又召开了供销社、药材公司、油脂公司、粮食局等部门参加的座谈会，找寻了生产门路和支援群众开展冬季生产的办法，然后提出初步方案，经过分头酝酿、交换意见，才正式提交常委会上来讨论通过。打破了新老委员间的“上下级”关系
    不过，要想开好县委会议，事前的准备工作固然重要，更重要的还在于会议中真正发扬民主。这个县的县委成员，也和其他许多县的情况一样，老县委委员少，新县委委员多。十七个县委委员中，1951年以前的县委委员只有县委书记张翰卿和副书记张思敬两人，其余委员都是1954年以后由区委书记、组织员、秘书、干事等提拔起来的。所以，过去那种“上下级”关系就自然地被带到县委会上来。新的委员认为：人家（指老的委员）是老上级，工作熟练、经验多、水平高，咱各方面都比不上。而老委员也存在着一种“老上级”的优越感，有时表现不够虚心。因此，过去在县委会议上就不容易展开争论，总是老委员一说一大套，新委员唯唯诺诺，不敢大胆发表意见。有时候虽有人觉得老委员的意见不大对，但由于“情面”关系，也不敢提出来。就是有人硬着头皮提出了反面意见，其他新委员也怕得罪“老上级”，不好意思明确表示自己的态度。这样，许多问题虽然在形式上是县委会议讨论通过的，但实际是按少数老委员的意见决定的。很明显，要想使每个县委委员的智慧发挥出来，就必须扫除县委中存在着的“上下级”关系的隔阂。应县县委在今年1月、4月、7月召开的县委委员生活检讨会和检查县委集体领导问题的会议上，对这个问题连续作了检查批判。从检查批判中，使新委员认识到：看“老上级”的面子，怕得罪“老上级”，不坚持原则的做法，实际上是一种对党、对人民不负责任的个人主义思想在作祟。老委员也检查了自以为是、不注意尊重新委员意见的“老大”作风，认识到这种作风挫伤了新委员的积极性、主动性，使集体领导的原则遭到破坏。从此，县委会议上这种“上下级”关系就逐渐打破了，不论新老委员都能在县委会议上畅所欲言，充分发表意见，展开争论，直到把所讨论的问题弄清，做出决定为止。
    认真研究少数人的反面意见
    事情往往是这样，反对了个人和少数人决定问题，重视了集体讨论决定问题的时候，就对少数人的意见——尤其是反面意见不重视了。应县县委在加强集体领导的过程中就曾发生过这种现象。他们以为：多数人的意见总是比少数人的意见正确，觉得少数人的意见听不听没要紧。有时还怕少数人提出反面意见，把问题弄得过于分歧不好统一，拉长会议时间。这样，就压制了民主，不能使有不同意见的少数人畅所欲言。少数人的意见果真就不值得重视吗？其实不然。少数人的意见有时也会是正确的。拿今年春天讨论扩大玉茭种植面积来说：当时多数县委委员只从少数村庄种玉茭增了产的事实出发，就认为扩大十六万亩玉茭不成问题。有少数县委委员分析了全县土质、气候、技术等条件，提出了不同意见。但是，因为这是少数人的意见，在当时未经认真考虑便被否决了。结果全县有二万多亩玉茭没有成熟或成熟的不好，造成严重减产。类似这样的事实深深教育了县委，使他们认识到认真研究少数人的意见，对于正确制定决议，正确解决问题是有作用的。即使反面意见是错误的，也有助于从多方面反复考虑问题，提高思想认识，避免犯片面性的错误。所以，以后便注意了少数人的意见。如最近讨论土豆折合粮食问题的时候，多数委员主张仍按去年四斤土豆折合一斤粮食计算；少数委员提出不同意见，认为这样折合会使群众吃亏，应该是按地区实际情况，能折多少折多少，这既符合政策，照顾了群众，又能鼓励群众多卖余粮。最后证明少数人的意见是正确的。这样，就更加鼓励了大家参与集体领导的积极性，谁有什么不同的观点、看法和意见，都能踊跃地在会议上提出来，展开争辩、讨论，使会议更增加了生气，也使作出正确的决议更有了把握。
    集体领导要和群众路线相结合
    虽然大家有什么意见都敢说了，但因为县委委员们过去下乡少，了解实际情况不多，在开始，会议开得也并不是十分热烈。尤其是在公安局、检察院、法院、供销社等部门工作的委员，一遇讨论中心工作就更提不出什么具体意见，要说也是些干巴巴的大道理。因此，要想把会议开得更好，还必须使大家了解实际情况。这就必须深入实际，深入群众，使集体领导和群众路线结合起来。因此，他们非常强调实行县委委员定期下乡制度。由于每个县委委员深入了下层，接近了群众，掌握了大量的情况，就更充实了会议的内容，大大提高了会议的质量。使每个决议、计划，都是在研究了大量的情况，集中了集体智慧的基础上制定出来的。如在最近开会估计产量的时候，县委书记张翰卿、副书记孙焕廷只看到下社、南马庄等好农业社庄稼长得好，推测全县每亩能平均产到一百三十斤到一百四十斤粮食，县长张俊秀、农村工作部长刘汉君跑的农业社多，认为只能产一百二十多斤。经过各个委员摆情况，并和县委农村工作部、县农林局研究、分析，最后确定为一百二十四斤。这个数字是符合实际的。同时，为了系统地深入地了解工作情况和群众思想，给正确制定决议、指示做好更充分的准备工作，今年以来他们还特别注意了进行有计划的调查、研究工作。如农业社分配问题，就曾先后在十五个农业社作过两次调查。
