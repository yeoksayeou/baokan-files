Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: By the end of 1956, the postal and telecommunications departments had established a total of over 21,000 postal and telecommunications bureaus and sub-bureaus nationwide, nearly double the number at the end of 1955, exceeding the planned level for 1957, the final year of the Five-Year Plan, by 53%; the total length of postal routes nationwide reached 1.9 million kilometers, achieving 96.7% of the planned level for 1957; long-distance telecommunications lines and urban telephone exchange equipment also exceeded the 1957 planned levels by 8% and 18%, respectively.

    Currently, all counties nationwide have access to wired or wireless telegraph communication, and over 95% of counties have access to wired or wireless telephone communication. Postal equipment in large and medium-sized cities has also seen varying degrees of development. In 1956, new automatic telephone systems were built in some emerging industrial cities such as Xi'an, Zhengzhou, and Jining, and new or expanded manual urban telephone systems were built in Lanzhou, Baotou, and Qiqihar. These developments have powerfully supported the needs of national industrial construction.

    Currently, there are an average of about eight self-operated postal and telecommunications service organizations in each county, most of which are located in rural market towns; 95% of townships now have postal routes, and postal and telecommunications bureaus can regularly deliver mail and newspapers to these villages. In densely populated areas, postal and telecommunications bureaus are already able to deliver mail and newspapers to agricultural cooperatives. The development of rural telephones has also been rapid, with approximately 240,000 kilometers of new rural telephone lines built in 1956, and 61% of townships nationwide now have telephone access. The development of rural postal and telecommunications construction, in coordination with the agricultural cooperativization movement, has greatly facilitated postal and telecommunications connections between rural governments, agricultural cooperatives, and the broad masses of peasants.

    Before liberation, many county towns lacked telegraph and telephone equipment, and rural areas had almost no telegraph and telephone equipment, with very few postal routes reaching the countryside. This situation has now been fundamentally changed.

    邮电部门许多指标超过1957年计划水平
    建立了二万多个邮电局、邮路长达一百九十万公里
    全国所有的县都通电报，95％以上的县通了电话
    新华社30日讯　到1956年底，邮电部门在全国设置的邮电局、支局共达到二万一千多个，比1955年底增加近一倍，超过五年计划最后一年1957年的计划水平53％；全国邮路长度共达到一百九十万公里，达到1957年的计划水平96.7％；长途电信线路和市内电话交换设备也都分别超额8％和18％达到1957年的计划水平。
    现在，全国所有的县都已经通达了有线或无线电报通信，95％以上的县已经通达了有线或无线电话，大中城市的邮电设备也都有不同程度的发展。1956年内，一些新兴的工业城市如西安、郑州、集宁新建了自动电话，兰州、包头和富拉尔基都新建或扩建了人工市内电话。这些发展有力地配合了国家工业建设的需要。
    现在，全国每个县境内平均有八个左右的自办邮电服务机构，大部分设在农村的集镇；已经有95％的乡通了邮路，邮电局可以定期把邮件报刊投送到这些乡村。在人口稠密的地区，邮电局已经能够把邮件报刊投送到农业社。乡村电话的发展也很迅速，1956年新建乡村电话线路约二十四万公里，全国已经有61％的乡通了电话。乡村邮电建设的发展，配合了农业合作化运动，大大便利了农村政权、农业社和广大农民的邮电联系。
    解放前，很多县城没有电报电话设备，农村的电报电话设备几乎没有，邮路也很少通到农村。这种情况现在已经根本改变了。
