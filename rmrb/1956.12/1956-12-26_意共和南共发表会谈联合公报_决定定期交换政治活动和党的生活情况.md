    新华社25日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社威尼斯讯：南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表团23日结束了对意大利共产党的一次为期十天的回访。这个代表团已经在23日晚上离开威尼斯回南斯拉夫。
    在访问期间，以南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会执行委员会委员斯坦鲍利奇为首的南共代表团同以意大利共产党副总书记隆哥为首的意共代表团举行了会谈。24日发表的会谈联合公报说：这一次访问加深了南共代表团对意大利情况和意共政策的了解。它证明，各国共产党本着使它们的活动更加有效的目的，加强彼此的了解和交流经验，对于加强它们的关系和合作是多么重要，即使在估计个别问题时有分歧。
    公报还指出：这一次的会谈“提供了研究两党进行有系统的合作的具体形式的可能性。两党已经决定定期把它们对于国际局势和工人运动的情况的态度，把它们的政治活动和两党生活的各个方面告诉对方。”两党还保证交换情报和资料，并且促进两国互派各种性质的代表团。
    在访问结束时，南共代表团和意共代表团联合举行了一次记者招待会。斯坦鲍利奇在会上指出，这次访问将进一步加强两党之间的积极关系。隆哥也告诉记者们说：两党之间已经建立了相互信任和谅解。他希望同其他国家的共产党发展像意共和南共之间的关系同样的关系。
