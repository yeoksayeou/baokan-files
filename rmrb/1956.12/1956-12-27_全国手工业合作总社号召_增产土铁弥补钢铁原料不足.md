Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives is calling on handicraft industry cooperatives in areas producing native iron to support the production of native iron by handicraftsmen.

On December 22nd, the Preparatory Committee issued a notice to handicraft industry cooperatives in fourteen provinces producing native iron, including Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Shanxi, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and Hebei. The notice pointed out that the supply of steel materials this year has not kept up with the increase in demand. Especially since the third quarter, the supply situation has become even more strained, and the phenomenon of iron handicraft cooperatives suspending work and waiting for materials is increasing throughout the country. In order to maintain handicraft production, with the consent of the State Economic Construction Commission, it has been decided to restore and increase the production of native iron in various places to compensate for the shortage of steel materials for handicrafts.

The notice requires handicraft industry cooperatives in various regions to rely on the leadership and support of local Party organizations and governments and, based on possible conditions, to increase the quantity of native iron produced in local plans for 1957 for handicraft use. It also requires comprehensive arrangements to be made for issues such as funds, equipment, transportation, and prices required for the development of native iron production. All native iron producing areas are required, on the basis of existing production equipment and technical conditions, to improve technology, appropriately increase the number of small blast furnaces and blast equipment with a daily output of 15 to 30 tons, and to make full use of old equipment replaced by state-owned industrial enterprises in various places. The funds needed for increasing native iron production in various places will mainly rely on local finances and internal solutions within enterprises. The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives also plans to withdraw 3 million yuan from the submitted funds and business profits to make up for the shortage of funds in provincial federations.

The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives hopes that all relevant departments will closely cooperate and support the production of native iron. It also requires agricultural cooperatives, on the principle of not neglecting both agricultural and sideline production, to make use of slack farming seasons to restore the original sideline production of native iron in order to increase the output of native iron.

    全国手工业合作总社号召
    增产土铁弥补钢铁原料不足
    新华社26日讯　中华全国手工业合作总社筹备委员会要求出产土铁地区的手工业联社支持手工业土铁生产。
    筹备委员会在12月22日向浙江、安徽、河南、山西、湖南、湖北、陕西、四川、福建、广东、广西、贵州、江西、河北等十四个出产土铁的省份的手工业联社发出通知，指出今年钢铁原料的供应跟不上需要量的增加，特别是第三季度以来，供应情况更为紧张，全国各地铁业手工业合作社停工待料的现象越来越多。为了维持手工业生产，经征得国家经济建设委员会同意，决定恢复和增加各地土铁生产，以弥补手工业钢铁原料的不足。
    通知要求各地手工业联社，依靠当地党组织和政府的领导和支持，根据可能条件，将1957年地方计划生产土铁的数量再增加一部分，供手工业使用；并且对发展土铁生产所需的资金、设备、运输、价格等问题作全面安排。要求各土铁产区，在现有的生产设备和技术条件的基础上，改进技术，适当增加一批日产十五吨到三十吨的小高炉和鼓风设备，并且尽量利用各地国营工业企业替换下来的旧设备。各地增产土铁所需资金，主要依靠地方财政和企业内部自行解决，全国手工业合作总社筹委会也计划从上缴基金及业务利润中抽出三百万元，以弥补各省联社资金上的不足。
    全国手工业合作总社筹委会希望各有关部门对土铁生产给予密切配合和支援。还要求农业社在农业副业生产两不误的原则下，利用农闲时间，恢复原有的土铁副业生产，以增加土铁产量。
