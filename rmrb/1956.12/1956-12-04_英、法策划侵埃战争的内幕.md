Inside Story of the Anglo-French Conspiracy to Invade Egypt
Lin Longtie

The Anglo-French collusion with Israel to launch a war of aggression against Egypt has met with a shameful defeat. The whole world clearly sees that the British and French colonialists are the culprits of this war of aggression. They instigated Israel to launch an offensive as a pretext for creating this dirty war. But until now, the British and French colonialists have stubbornly described the invasion of Egypt as an "emergency police action" to "separate" Israel and Egypt, attempting to exonerate themselves from their crime of aggression. However, lies cannot cover up the facts. Recently, some Western newspapers, especially American newspapers, have published lengthy reports on the process of the British and French governments planning the war of aggression against Egypt. These materials confirm the crimes of collusion between Britain, France, and Israel, and further reveal the sinister face of the Anglo-French aggressors.

	Target – Egypt

According to American newspaper materials, Britain and France had been preparing for a long time through joint conspiracy to launch a war of aggression against Egypt. According to a report in the November 12th issue of the American "Time" magazine, a few days after Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal, French Prime Minister Mollet sent the French Minister of Defense to London to discuss a joint military plan with Britain to reoccupy the Suez Canal. For this purpose, Britain and France specially established a joint military organization called "Amilcar" (Note: Father of Hannibal, the Carthaginian general). After this, the British and French governments outwardly adopted a posture of agreeing to negotiations, but in reality, this was a double-dealing tactic to actively prepare for war behind the scenes. The November 9th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" pointed out that while the London conference was in progress, the combined sea, land, and air forces of Britain and France had already begun to gather at forward bases in Cyprus, Malta, and Algeria; by "early September, military preparations were roughly completed." "Time" magazine also reported that the tanks of the Anglo-French allied forces had long been painted in "yellow sand color" suitable for desert warfare, and "occupation zone military banknotes" had also been prepared, and a plan to requisition civilian transport planes had also been formulated: "The target is Egypt."

	France Colludes with Israel

Since Britain and France had completed their war preparations, they then began to look for a pretext to provoke war.

According to "Time" magazine, France was the first to decide to instigate Israel to attack Egypt to realize the plan to reoccupy the Suez Canal. "U.S. News & World Report" also pointed out that France played an "important role" in the conspiracy to instigate Israel to attack Egypt. The magazine said that because France believed that its current tragic situation in North Africa was the result of Egypt's "incitement," France had been "secretly encouraging Israel to attack Egypt." To this end, France has continuously strengthened the combat power of the Israeli army with military equipment. "U.S. News & World Report" said that as early as April and May of this year, France, with the "agreement" of the United States, had transported "twenty-four Mystère jet fighters" to Israel; after Egypt took back the Suez Canal, according to "Western intelligence," France continued to transport jet aircraft and military equipment to Israel. "Time" magazine reported that during this period, France had at least "secretly handed over thirty Mystère jet fighters to Israel." "U.S. News & World Report" emphasized in its report that it was precisely because of French military assistance that "promoted Israel's determination to confront the Arabs." "Time" magazine also described: in the conspiracy to launch the war of aggression against Egypt, "France is the instigator," and "Israel is the 'willing thug'." The fact is not only this. According to a report by Reuters reporter A. Valentine on November 21, French aircraft participated in the battle to attack the Sinai Peninsula.

	Britain Accepts France's Plan

"U.S. News & World Report" quoted a British observer as saying that Israel's attack on Egypt gave Eden a "heaven-sent excuse" to implement the military plan that had been prepared long ago. But the magazine pointed out that Eden had some concerns before making the "final decision" to adopt the French plan. That is, Britain had a treaty of alliance with Jordan; Britain feared that when Israel attacked Egypt, other Arab countries, including Jordan, would also be involved in the war, and Britain might suddenly "be asked to respect the promise to help Jordan resist Israel" when fighting against Egypt.

In fact, Britain wanted to use the trick of dividing the Arab countries and defeating them one by one to achieve the goal of restoring colonial rule in the Middle East.

Therefore, the Eden government had done some work in this regard. According to "U.S. News & World Report," the British ambassador to Israel was ordered to tell the Israeli government that Britain hoped that Israel "would not attack Jordan." After Britain received this guarantee from the Israeli government, it agreed to the plan for Israel to launch an offensive.

	Britain and France Intensify Planning War Conspiracy

A dispatch from the Washington diplomatic correspondent of the British "Times" on November 20 revealed the continued actions of Britain, France, and Israel in planning the war. Under the pressure of public opinion, Britain and France had to accept the six principles for resolving the Suez Canal issue on the basis of respecting Egyptian sovereignty at the United Nations, but they had already decided at that time to abandon these principles. The newspaper's reporter said, based on information obtained from the United States, that on October 13, the day the Security Council passed the six principles, France and Israel began to discuss a joint military action plan to be "launched in succession." On the same day, British Prime Minister Eden announced that resolving the Suez Canal issue did not rule out the use of "force." At the same time, "Time" magazine also reported that during this period, Mollet had said to his cabinet members: "Something will happen before the end of the year," but he was unwilling to explain more because this was "a diplomatic secret."

"Time" magazine also reported that on October 16, just after the British delegation returned from the Security Council, Eden and Foreign Secretary Lloyd suddenly flew to Paris to meet with French Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau, "four people talked secretly for five hours." According to the magazine's sources, in this secret talk, Eden and Mollet agreed that once Israel attacked Egypt, Britain and France would jointly occupy the canal zone under the pretext of "protecting the canal." The November 20th dispatch from the "Times" also said that, according to diplomatic sources in Washington, after this meeting, Britain and France had prepared to support Israel at the United Nations; France had also promised to further supply Israel with military equipment.

	The Time for the Attack is Ripe

After all the above preparations were completed, on October 23, Pineau flew to London. According to "Time" magazine, Pineau's task was to inform Eden of the news that Israel was about to attack Egypt. The magazine also revealed that Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion suggested that choosing this time to launch an aggression was a rare opportunity: First, the Hungarian incident was at its "climax," "tying the hands of the Soviet Union." Second, the United States was busy with the election, meaning that although the United States might disagree with the use of force, it could be forced to support Britain and France using the pressure of war to force Egypt to submit and seize the Suez Canal. Therefore, they believed that the time for the attack was ripe.

Precisely because this conspiracy could not be seen in the sunlight, "Time" magazine said that Eden did not notify the other member states of the United Kingdom of this matter, nor did he tell the House of Commons and Conservative Party colleagues, "it seems that only Foreign Secretary Lloyd knew about this."

On the 25th, Israel secretly and rapidly mobilized. According to "Time" magazine, on the morning of the 29th, Israel notified the British ambassador to Israel that Israeli troops "would attack in the evening" and asked him to convey the message to Eden. On the same night, as "U.S. News & World Report" said: Israeli troops, strengthened by French military equipment, launched a so-called "retaliatory attack," creating a long-awaited opportunity for Britain and France.

Facts prove that the United States knew about Israel's plan to attack Egypt in advance. The day before Israel launched the attack, the U.S. State Department issued a statement withdrawing overseas Chinese.

What happened later is well known. On the 30th, the heads of the British and French governments held an emergency meeting in London, and then Eden left the meeting to go to the House of Commons, proposing an ultimatum for armed intervention in Egypt. Mollet rushed back to Paris and announced in the National Assembly that night an ultimatum to take concerted action with Britain. Then, Britain and France began bombing Cairo, and the war of aggression against Egypt was launched in this way.

	The Bankruptcy of Wishful Thinking

"U.S. News & World Report" said that "overthrowing the Nasser government," "controlling the Suez Canal," and preserving the privilege of plundering oil in the Middle East were the "real goals" of the British and French military action. The magazine revealed that Britain and France had anticipated the difficulties caused by the cutting of the Suez Canal and oil pipelines due to their launching of the war, and also anticipated widespread resistance from the Arabs, but they believed that "once the Egyptian army was defeated," the Nasser government collapsed, "the subsequent problems would be easier to solve." The plan of Britain and France was that they would quickly sign a ceasefire agreement with "any government that replaced Nasser" and quickly resolve the issue of international control of the Suez Canal. The magazine also revealed that some forces in Britain and France also advocated the annexation of the Sinai Peninsula by Israel. From here, the sinister plan of Britain and France to re-enslave Egypt, restore colonial rule in the Middle East, and further suppress the national independence movements of the world is fully exposed. However, they underestimated the powerful national independence movement and the forces of peace. With the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people and the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the wishful thinking of Britain and France has been shattered.

Now, the ugly face of Britain and France in launching the war of aggression against Egypt after instructing Israel to attack Egypt has been completely exposed. Even "Time" magazine believes that "much evidence indicates that the two attacks were premeditated." No matter how Britain and France quibble and deny, they can absolutely not escape the crime of aggression.

　　英、法策划侵埃战争的内幕
　　林龙铁
    英、法两国勾结以色列对埃及发动的侵略战争已遭到了可耻的失败。全世界都清楚地看到，英、法殖民者是这场侵略战争的罪魁祸首，是他们策动以色列发动进攻，来作为制造这场肮脏战争的借口的。但是直到现在，英、法殖民者仍然把侵埃战争硬说成是为了“隔开”以色列和埃及的“紧急警察行动”，企图以此来开脱他们的侵略罪责。但是，谎言是包不住事实的。最近一些西方国家的报刊，特别是美国报刊连篇累牍地刊载了英、法两国政府策划侵略埃及战争的经过，这些材料证实了英法和以色列相互勾结的罪行，使人们进一步认清英法侵略者的阴险面目。
          目标——埃及
    根据美国报刊材料，英、法是经过长期的共同密谋来准备向埃及发动侵略战争的。据11月12日的美国“时代周刊”的报道，在埃及将苏伊士运河收归国有后没有几天，法国总理摩勒就派遣法国国防部长前往伦敦，和英国商讨重占苏伊士运河的联合军事计划。为了这个目的，英、法特别成立了一个称为“阿米尔卡”（注：公元前迦太基大将汉尼拔的父亲）的联合军事机构。在此以后，英、法政府表面上同意谈判的姿态，实际上是一种两面手法，以便在背后积极准备战争。11月9日的“美国新闻与世界报道”就指出，在伦敦会议正在进行的时候，英法两国的海、陆、空联军已开始在塞浦路斯、马尔他和阿尔及利亚的前进基地集结；到了“9月初旬，军事准备大致完成。”“时代周刊”并且报道说，英法联军的坦克早就漆上了适宜于沙漠作战的“黄沙颜色”，“占领区军用钞票”也早就准备好了，并且还制定了征用民用运输机的计划：“目标是埃及”。
        法国勾结以色列
    英、法既然完成了战争准备，接着开始寻找可以挑起战争的借口。
    据“时代周刊”透露，法国最先决定策动以色列进攻埃及来实现重新占领苏伊士运河的计划。“美国新闻与世界报道”也指出，法国在策动以色列进攻埃及的阴谋中充当了“重要角色”。这家杂志说，由于法国认为目前它在北非的悲惨处境是埃及“煽动”的结果，因此法国一直在
  “秘密鼓动以色列进攻埃及”。为此，法国不断以军事装备来增强以色列军队的战斗力量。“美国新闻与世界报道”说，早在今年4、5月间，法国曾在美国“同意”下运给以色列“二十四架神秘式喷气战斗机”；在埃及收回苏伊士运河以后，根据“西方情报”，法国又继续运给以色列喷气式飞机和军事装备。“时代周刊”的报道说，在这个期间，法国至少“秘密交给以色列三十架神秘式喷气战斗机”。“美国新闻与世界报道”在报道中着重指出，正是由于法国的军事援助，“推动了以色列和阿拉伯人摊牌的决心”。“时代周刊”也描述说：在发动侵埃战争的阴谋里“法国是教唆者”，而“以色列是‘自愿的打手’”。事实不仅如此，据路透社记者亚·瓦伦丁11月21日的报道，法国飞机曾经参加进攻西奈半岛的战斗。
    英国接受了法国的计划
      “美国新闻与世界报道”引用一位英国观察家的话说，以色列进攻埃及使艾登在执行早已准备好的军事计划时找到了一个“天赐的借口”。但是这家杂志指出，艾登在下“最后决心”采纳法国计划之前是曾经有过一些顾虑的，这就是英国和约旦订有同盟条约；英国唯恐以色列进攻埃及时，包括约旦在内的其他阿拉伯国家也会卷入这场战争，而使英国可能在对埃及作战时，忽然又“被要求尊重援助约旦抵抗以色列的诺言。”
    实际上，英国是想用分化阿拉伯国家，各个击破的诡计，来达到在中东恢复殖民统治的目的。
    因此，艾登政府曾在这方面做了一些工作。据“美国新闻与世界报道”透露说，英国驻以色列大使曾奉命向以色列政府表示，英国希望以色列“不要进攻约旦”。英国在得到了以色列政府的这种保证之后，就同意了由以色列发动进攻的计划。
  英、法加紧策划战争阴谋
    11月20日英国“泰晤士报”驻华盛顿外交记者的一篇通讯透露了英、法、以策划战争的继续行动。在舆论的压力下，英法不得不在联合国接受在尊重埃及主权的基础上解决苏伊士运河问题的六项原则，但它们那时就已决定，背弃这些原则。这家报纸的记者根据从美国得到的情报说，10月13日在安理会通过了六项原则的这一天，法、以就开始商谈“先后发动”的联合军事行动计划。同一天，英国首相艾登宣布解决苏伊士运河问题并不排斥使用“武力”的手段。同时，“时代周刊”也报道说，在这个期间摩勒曾对他的阁员说：“年底以前将发生一些事情”，但是他不愿作更多的说明，因为这是“一项外交秘密”。
      “时代周刊”还报道说，10月16日，英国代表团刚从安理会归来，艾登就和外交大臣劳埃德突然飞往巴黎和法国总理摩勒及外长比诺会晤，“四人密谈了五小时”。据这家杂志得到的消息，在这次密谈中，艾登和摩勒同意一旦以色列进攻埃及，英法将以“保护运河为借口共同占领运河区”。20日“泰晤士报”的这篇外交通讯中也说，根据在华盛顿的外交界人士的消息，在这次会议以后，英法已准备在联合国支持以色列；法国并且还答应进一步供给以色列以军事装备。
      进攻时机已经成熟
    在上述的一切准备好了以后，10月23日，比诺飞往伦敦。据“时代周刊”说，比诺的任务是通知艾登以色列即将进攻埃及的消息。这家杂志并透露说，以色列总理本—古里安献计说，选择这个时间发动侵略是一个难得的机会：一、匈牙利事件正在“高潮”，“缚住了苏联的双手”。二、美国正在忙于大选，意思就是尽管美国可能不同意使用武力，但可以迫使美国支持英法以用战争的压力来使埃及屈服，夺取苏伊士运河。因此，他们认为进攻的时机已经成熟了。
    正由于这件阴谋见不得阳光，“时代周刊”说，艾登既没有把这件事通知联合王国的其他成员国家，也没有告诉下院和保守党同事，“似乎仅有外交大臣劳埃德预闻这件事。”
    25日，以色列秘密而迅速地动员。据“时代周刊”的消息，29日晨，以色列通知英国驻以大使以色列军队“将在傍晚进攻”，并要求他将消息传达给艾登。就在当天晚上，如“美国新闻与世界报道”所说的：被法国军事装备加强了的以色列军队发动了所谓“报复性的攻击”，替英法制造了等待已久的机会。
    事实证明，美国事先还是知道以色列进攻埃及的计划的。在以色列发动进攻的前一天，美国国务院就发表撤退侨民的声明。
    以后的事情是人所共知的了。30日，英、法政府首脑在伦敦举行紧急会议，接着艾登离开会场前往下院，提出了武装干涉埃及的最后通牒。摩勒赶回巴黎，当晚也在国民议会宣布和英国采取一致行动的最后通牒。接着，英法开始轰炸开罗，侵略埃及的战争就这样地发动起来了。
      如意算盘的破产
      “美国新闻与世界报道”说，“推翻纳赛尔政府”、“控制苏伊士运河”和保存在中东掠夺石油的特权，是英、法军事行动的“真正目标”。这家杂志透露，英法已预料到由于它们发动战争而造成的苏伊士运河和油管被切断而产生的困难，同时也预料到将遭到阿拉伯人广泛的抵抗，但是，它们认为“一旦埃及军队被击败了”，纳赛尔政府垮台了，“以后的问题比较容易解决。”英法的计划是它们将和“接替纳赛尔的任何政府”迅速签订停战协定，并且迅速解决苏伊士运河的国际管制问题。这家杂志还透露说，英法的某些势力还主张由以色列吞并西奈半岛。从这里完全暴露了英法企图重新奴役埃及，在中东恢复殖民统治，并进一步镇压全世界的民族独立运动的凶恶计划。但是，它们低估了强大的民族独立运动和和平力量。在埃及人民英勇抵抗和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支援下，英、法的如意算盘已经被粉碎了。
    现在，英、法在指使以色列进攻埃及以后，发动侵埃战争的丑恶面目已暴露无遗。连“时代周刊”也认为，“许多证据表明这两个进攻是经过预谋的”。不论英、法两国政府怎样狡辩和抵赖，它们已绝对无法逃脱侵略的罪责了。
