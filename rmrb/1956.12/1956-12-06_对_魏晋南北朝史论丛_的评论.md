Comments on "Collected Essays on the History of the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties"

　　The latest issue of "Historical Research" (No. 11, 1956) published He Changqun's article "A Discussion on Clans and Cliques," which criticizes Tang Changru's book "Collected Essays on the History of the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties."

　　The book review states that the strength of "Collected Essays on the History of the Wei, Jin, and Southern and Northern Dynasties" lies in its possession of relatively abundant materials and its detailed textual research on these materials. Its weakness is that the tedious textual research outweighs the analysis of the issues, failing to explain the essence of the problems.

　　The first essay in the book discusses the issues of clans and cliques in the Jiangnan region during the late Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period. The book review argues that studying the social nature of clans in the Han, Wei, and Jin dynasties is of great significance for studying the history of this period. However, in this essay, the author's explanation of this issue only touches upon superficial phenomena such as the names of clans, cliques, and teams, rather than its historical content. The fundamental reason is that the author neglects the analysis of the social class nature of these clans at that time and confuses these clans with the feudal families and aristocratic clans that arose in the late Western Han and early Eastern Han dynasties. Thus, he cannot touch upon, let alone explain, the following most important questions. For example, what is the social nature of the clans in the Han, Wei, and Jin dynasties? How did the armed organizations of these clans (cliques) arise? How to analyze the contradictions between clans, feudal regimes, and peasants? And so on.

　　While criticizing the book, the book review also puts forward its own views on this issue. The book review states that the "clans" shown in the historical records of the Han, Wei, and Jin dynasties refer to the remnants of clan communes formed by blood and regional relations since the Warring States period. The settlement of a clan included both exploiters and the exploited. Therefore, the existence of a clan must have the following main conditions: the clan chiefs and powerful figures ostensibly regard land as a community, but in reality, this is only the material basis for the clan chiefs and powerful figures to monopolize the clan's gathering; there is a common ancestral sacrifice as a spiritual appeal to the clan members; economic regulatory measures are needed to cover up the class contradictions within the clan, and so on.

　　The book review also states that the powerful clans and large families—remnants of clan communes—since the Warring States period, although severely hit by the absolute monarchy in the century after Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the old forces of the clans were still very strong in the Eastern Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period at the end of the Han Dynasty. It was a backward old group in the development of feudal production relations at that time. Each clan group was a small "kingdom," which was incompatible with the centralized power of feudal autocracy. Therefore, the feudal regimes in the Han and Wei dynasties had to both crush the ties of the remnants of clan communes and constantly attack these powerful clans and large families, while at the same time constantly wooing and compromising with them.

　　Regarding the establishment of the states of Sun Wu and Cao Wei, the book writes that this represents the victory of certain clan alliances over their opposing clan alliances. However, the book review believes that this statement is not in line with historical facts. The book review states that, judging from their various measures, Cao Cao and the Sun family should not be regarded as representatives of the old forces of the remnants of clan communes, but should be regarded as the so-called "famous scholars" and "heroes" among the landlord class at that time. They demanded an end to the state of war and the establishment of a unified and centralized feudal power.

　　Finally, the book review also explored the differentiation process of clans since the Han Dynasty. It said that although the natural economy still occupied a major position in the Han Dynasty, the development of currency and usury promoted the class differentiation in rural areas, thereby differentiating the organization of clans and causing the emergence of new families. Although the emerging families after the Qin and Han dynasties were also called "families," their historical content was different from the clans in the Western Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period at the end of the Han Dynasty. This new family was composed of direct relatives, not just based on blood and regional relations. By the Song Dynasty, this kind of family began to have organizations such as righteous estates, sacrificial fields, ancestral halls, and genealogy, which also had the effect of alleviating class contradictions within the family, but its social nature was different from the clan communes' remnants of the clan, but was a more strict feudal family organization.

### 对“魏晋南北朝史论丛”的评论

　　对“魏晋南北朝史论丛”的评论
    最近出版的一期“历史研究”（1956年第十一期），发表了贺昌群的“关于宗族、宗部的商榷”一文，对唐长孺的“魏晋南北朝史论丛”一书提出批评意见。
    书评论为，“魏晋南北朝史论丛”一书的长处在于占有较丰富的材料，对这些材料作了较详细的考证。它的缺点在于烦琐的考据多于问题的分析，没有说明问题的实质。
    这本书的第一篇论文是谈汉末三国时代江南的宗族、宗部等问题的。书评认为，研究两汉魏晋的宗族的社会性质，对于研究两汉魏晋这一段的历史是有重大的意义的。但是，作者在这篇论文中，对于这个问题的说明，只是一些关于宗族、宗部、宗伍等名称的表面现象，而不是它的历史内容。基本原因就是作者忽视了对当时这种宗族的社会阶级性质的分析，而把这种宗族同西汉末东汉初兴起的封建家族、门阀混淆起来。这样，他就既不能触及，更不能说明下列一些最重要的问题。例如，两汉魏晋这种宗族的社会性质是什么？这种宗族的武装组织（宗部）是怎样产生的？宗族、封建政权同农民三者之间的矛盾如何分析？等等。
    在对这本书提出批评的同时，书评还提出了自己对这个问题的看法。书评中说，两汉魏晋史籍所显示的“宗族”，是指战国以来以血缘关系和地域关系构成的氏族公社的遗留。一个宗族的聚居，包含着剥削者和被剥削者。因此，一个宗族的存在就必有如下一些主要条件：宗族的家长豪强表面上以土地为共同体，实际上这只是家长豪强垄断一个宗族所以聚族而居的物质基础；有一个共同的祖先祭祀，作为对宗族成员的精神感召；要具有经济的调剂措施，以掩盖宗族内部的阶级矛盾，等等。
    书评还说，战国以来的强宗大族——氏族公社残余，虽经汉武帝以后百年间绝对君权的重大打击，但是宗族的旧势力到东汉和汉末三国还是很强大的。它是当时封建生产关系发展上一种落后的旧集团，每一个宗族集团就是一个小小的
  “王国”，它同封建专制主义的中央集权是不能相容的。因此，汉魏时代的封建政权，必须一面摧挫氏族公社残余的联系，不断打击这种强宗大族，一面又不断同他们拉拢妥协。
    关于孙吴和曹魏的建国，书中写道，这是代表若干宗族联盟对于其敌对宗族联盟的胜利。但是，书评认为这个说法是不符合历史事实的。书评中说，曹操和孙氏父子，以其各方面的措施来看，他们都不应被认为是氏族公社残余的旧势力的代表，而应被认为是地主阶级中当时所谓“名士”和“英雄”。他们要求结束战争状态，建立一个统一的中央政权的封建势力。
    最后，书评还对两汉以来宗族的分化过程作了探讨。它说，在两汉时，自然经济虽然仍占主要地位，但是由于货币和高利贷的发达，这就促使了农村的阶级分化，从而分化了宗族的组织，引起了新的家庭的出现。秦汉后的新兴家族虽然也称“家族”，但是它的历史内容已不同于西汉和汉末三国时代的宗族了。这种新的家族是由直系家属构成的，而非仅仅由于血缘和地域的关系。到了宋代，这种家族开始有义庄、祭田、宗祠和族谱等的组织，这些组织也有和缓家族内部阶级矛盾的作用，但是它的社会性质已经不同于氏族公社残余的宗族，而是更严密的封建家族组织了。　　（静）
