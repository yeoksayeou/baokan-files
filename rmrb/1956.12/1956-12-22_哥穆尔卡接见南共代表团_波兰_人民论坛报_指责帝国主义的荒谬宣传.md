Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 21st: According to a report by the Polish News Agency, Gomulka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, received the delegation of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia headed by Vukmanović on the morning of the 20th.

    Representatives of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Polish United Workers' Party continued their talks on the afternoon of the 20th. The talks, which began on the afternoon of the 19th, are studying political and economic issues related to the two parties and the two countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 20th: The Polish "People's Tribune" published an editorial on the 19th entitled "Welcome, Comrades from Yugoslavia," welcoming the visit of the delegation of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia to Poland.

    The editorial pointed out that the visit of the delegation of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia provides an opportunity for free and sincere discussions between the Polish and Yugoslav parties, and that major issues of the international workers' movement of concern to both parties can be discussed.

    The editorial said: Naturally, the entire effort of imperialist propaganda, which is hostile to socialism, is to turn various Communist and Workers' parties against each other, especially today, and to speculate on the existence of various "groups" among the Communists. The purpose of this propaganda is too obvious: it is to sow suspicion within the international working-class movement, thereby creating discord and destroying it. There is no doubt that this propaganda will not let go of this opportunity to fabricate various lies on the topic of the "secret" purposes of cooperation between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Polish United Workers' Party. All these speculations and fabrications are absurd.

    The editorial concluded by expressing its belief that further rapprochement between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Polish United Workers' Party will benefit the cause of cooperation between Communist parties and socialist countries, and sincerely hopes that the visit of the Yugoslav comrades will also become an important contribution to strengthening the unity of the working-class movement and to the cause of international peace.

    哥穆尔卡接见南共代表团
    波兰“人民论坛报”指责帝国主义的荒谬宣传
    新华社华沙21日电　据波兰通讯社报道：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡20日上午接见了以伏克曼诺维奇为首的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表团。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表和波兰统一工人党的代表20日下午继续举行了会谈。在从19日下午开始举行的会谈中，正在研究同两党和两国有关的政治和经济问题。
    新华社华沙20日电　波兰“人民论坛报”19日以“欢迎南斯拉夫的同志们”为题发表社论，欢迎南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表团的访问波兰。
    社论指出，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表团的访问，提供了波南两党之间自由和真挚讨论的机会，可以讨论与两党利害有关的国际工人运动的重大问题。
    社论说：自然，敌视社会主义的帝国主义宣传的全部努力是为了，特别在今天，使各个共产党和工人党互相反对，就共产党中间存在各种“集团”这个题目进行猜测。这种宣传的目的太明显了：它是要在国际工人阶级运动内部散播怀疑，从而制造不和，并且把它摧毁。毫无疑问，这种宣传将不会放过这个机会来就南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和波兰统一工人党之间的合作的“秘密”目的这一题目进行各种各样的捏造。所有这些猜测和捏造都是荒谬的。
    社论最后表示相信，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和波兰统一工人党之间的进一步接近，将有利于各国共产党和社会主义国家的合作的事业，并且热诚地希望，南斯拉夫同志们的来访，也应当成为对加强工人阶级运动的团结以及对国际和平事业的一个重要贡献。
