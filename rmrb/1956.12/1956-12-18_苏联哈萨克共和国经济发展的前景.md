Prospects for Economic Development in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic
Jun Qiang

Not long ago, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded the Order of Lenin to the Kazakh Republic, praising its outstanding achievements in opening up wasteland and establishing a new major grain base for the Soviet Union. This republic has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, delivering 1.034 billion poods of grain to the state, more than the total grain provided to the state in the eleven years before the reclamation. Now, it has leapt to become the second largest grain base in the Soviet Union, leaving the Ukrainian Republic, which has always been known as the "granary" of the Soviet Union, far behind. At the same time, the Sixth Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union stipulates that the eastern region should be vigorously developed, and the Kazakh Republic is one of the key development areas. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the amount of state investment in the Kazakh Republic will exceed more than half of the total investment in the previous five Five-Year Plans. It can be seen that today the Kazakh Republic occupies an important position in the Soviet national economy, and its economy is developing rapidly.

The Kazakh Republic has an area of 2,766,000 square kilometers, exceeding the total area of France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Japan. It is only smaller than the Russian Federation among the Soviet republics, and larger than the total area of all other republics. It has a population of 8.5 million, second only to the Russian Federation and Ukraine.

The vast land of Kazakhstan has unlimited potential for agricultural development. Not only that, but it also has incredibly rich mineral resources. Kazakhstan ranks first in the Soviet Union in terms of reserves of copper, lead, zinc, silver, cadmium, and the like. Among them, copper reserves account for more than half of the Soviet Union's total, lead accounts for three-quarters, zinc accounts for half, and silver and cadmium reserves account for more than two-thirds. In addition, there are raw materials for refining nickel, aluminum and other rare metals. Iron reserves have exceeded those of the Urals and Ukraine, ranking first in the Soviet Union. The Karaganda coal mining area in the central region has long been known as the third largest coal production base in the Soviet Union, second only to Donbass and Kuzbass.

Before the establishment of the Soviet regime, Kazakhstan, with its vast land and abundant resources, was a backward colonial area under the rule of Tsarist Russia. The people lived a nomadic life. Agriculture was very underdeveloped, and there was almost no industry. Vast lands were not reclaimed, and underground resources were not explored, let alone exploited. After the October Revolution, from 1928 to 1930, Kazakhstan eliminated the remnants of feudalism and carried out tremendous work in the socialist transformation and technological transformation of agriculture, settling all nomadic households. This played a great role in promoting the development of productive forces in Kazakhstan. During the Soviet era, Kazakhstan gradually transformed from a backward area into an economically developed socialist republic, and its industry and agriculture have achieved tremendous development.

However, despite this, Kazakhstan's vast wasteland has not been fully reclaimed. Kazakhstan's strong resources have not been fully utilized. In recent years, the Soviet Union has been making active efforts in these areas, on the one hand, using large-scale reclamation of wasteland to increase the sown area of ​​grain, and on the other hand, implementing the general policy of vigorously developing the eastern region to improve the allocation of productive forces.

In 1954, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a historic resolution on the large-scale reclamation of wasteland. This resolution is of epoch-making significance to the Kazakh Republic. In the past three years, this republic has reclaimed 20 million hectares of wasteland and built 337 new state farms. The sown area has expanded from 9.7 million hectares in 1953 to 27.8 million hectares this year. This cannot but cause major changes in the economic outlook of the Kazakh Republic. This change has been fully demonstrated in this year's bumper grain harvest.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the Kazakh Republic will continue to reclaim wasteland and vigorously develop agriculture, so that the republic's grain output by 1960, when the Sixth Five-Year Plan is completed, will increase fourfold compared with 1955. In addition, by the end of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, sugar beet will increase by 1.2 times compared with 1955, seed cotton by 2.3 times, wool by 1.6 times, and meat by half. Kazakhstan's animal husbandry has always occupied a very important position in the Soviet Union. The number of sheep ranks second in the country, and the number of cattle and horses ranks third. At the same time, the republic has more than 170 million hectares of grassland and mountain pastures. Judging from this year's grain harvest achievements, these tasks stipulated in the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the republic in agriculture and animal husbandry will undoubtedly be completed as scheduled. At that time, the Kazakh Republic will surpass other major economic regions of the Soviet Union in terms of wheat production and wool procurement and rank first in the country.

In order to further improve the allocation of productive forces, the directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Sixth Five-Year Plan emphasized the vigorous development of the eastern region. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, investment in the development of the eastern region accounts for almost half of the country's total investment, and the eastern region mainly refers to Siberia and Kazakhstan. The entire industrial output of the Kazakh Republic will increase by 1.2 times during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This number is more than any other republic in the Soviet Union.

During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, a huge Sokolovsk-Sarbay ore dressing combine will first be built in the Kustanai Oblast. The iron ore reserves in these two places are more than those in the Urals. By 1960, this ore dressing combine in Kazakhstan will be able to supply 5.6 million tons of iron ore to steel plants in the eastern region. In addition to Kustanai Oblast, Karaganda Oblast is also a major iron ore producing area. Now, a huge Karaganda steel plant is being built on the grassland not far from Karaganda. This factory will not only guarantee Kazakhstan's needs for ferrous metals in the future, but also supply the Soviet Central Asian republics.

The huge metallurgical industry requires a large amount of coal. Kazakhstan's coal production during the Sixth Five-Year Plan should increase by 60%. The production capacity of the famous Karaganda mining area will be doubled during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. By 1960, its coal production will be more than the coal production of the entire Russia before the revolution. The Kazakh Republic also has a famous Ekibastuz coal mining area. The coal seam there is more than 100 meters thick, and all of it can be mined by open-pit methods. It is now planned to build more than ten large mining sites with an annual output of several million tons each. In addition, the Turgaisk coal area, newly explored in Kustanai Oblast, will also begin mining.

The Emba River basin, which flows into the Caspian Sea, is rich in oil, and its output ranks fourth in the Soviet Union, after Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. The Sixth Five-Year Plan will expand oil extraction by 40% and build two new large oil refineries. In this way, all of Kazakhstan's needs for petroleum products can be fully met.

The non-ferrous metallurgy industry of the Kazakh Republic was also established in a relatively short period of time. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, in addition to expanding existing smelting plants and ore dressing plants, a large ore dressing plant will be newly built in the Bauzshakuri copper mine area newly discovered in Pavlodar Oblast. In recent years, very rich bauxite deposits have also been discovered in Kustanai Oblast. In addition to building several large ore dressing plants, the largest aluminum manufacturing plant in the Soviet Union will also be built in Pavlodar.

The machinery manufacturing industry will also be vigorously developed along with the development of the metallurgical industry. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, a huge heavy machinery manufacturing plant producing rolling mill equipment will be built in Petropavlovsk, and its production capacity can be comparable to the famous Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Plant. In addition, about 20 machinery manufacturing plants, such as combine harvester manufacturing plants, will also be built.

During the Soviet era, Kazakhstan has established modern, highly mechanized textile, knitting, leather, and other enterprises and food industries. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, in addition to building huge cotton textile combine factories, wool washing plants, and leather shoe combine factories, sixteen meat combine factories, thirty-three mechanized oil mills, fourteen cheese factories, etc. will also be established.

The further development of the national economy requires a large amount of power. Although Kazakhstan's electricity production is increasing rapidly, with a power generation of 5.7 billion kilowatt-hours in 1955, some industrial centers still feel insufficient power. Therefore, in addition to the completion of the Bukhtarma hydro hub in East Kazakhstan Oblast during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, it is also planned to build two powerful hydroelectric power stations, one is the largest Shulbin hydroelectric power station on the Ertis River, and the other is the Kapchagai hydroelectric power station.

Currently, the working people of Kazakhstan are confidently implementing the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The productive forces of the Kazakh Republic will be greatly developed after the completion of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The republic's economic situation will also be unprecedentedly prosperous. The Kazakh Republic will become a republic with well-developed agriculture and animal husbandry, and a powerful industry. In this way, Kazakhstan will become one of the largest industrial bases and grain bases in the Soviet Union, and become a strong pillar of Soviet communist construction.

    苏联哈萨克共和国经济发展的前景
    君强
    不久以前，苏联最高苏维埃主席团把列宁勋章颁给了哈萨克共和国，表扬它在开垦荒地、建立苏联新的大谷物基地方面获得的卓越成就。这个共和国今年获得了空前的大丰收，向国家交售了十亿零三十四万普特谷物，比开荒前十一年间总共提供给国家的谷物还要多。现在，它已一跃而成为苏联的第二大谷物基地，使一向号称苏联“谷仓”的乌克兰共和国远远地落在后边了。同时，苏联第六个五年计划规定要大力开发东部地区，哈萨克共和国就是重点开发地区之一。在第六个五年计划中，国家对哈萨克共和国的投资数目将超过以前五个五年计划投资总和的一半。由此可见，今天哈萨克共和国在苏联国民经济中占着重要的地位，它的经济正在飞跃发展。
    哈萨克共和国的面积有二百七十六万六千平方公里，超过了法国、德国、英国、意大利和日本五个国家面积的总和。它在苏联各加盟共和国中仅仅小于俄罗斯联邦，比其他各加盟共和国面积的总和还要大。它的人口有八百五十万，次于俄罗斯联邦和乌克兰。
    哈萨克斯坦的辽阔土地蕴藏着发展农业的无限潜力。不仅这样，它还拥有无比丰富的矿藏。哈萨克斯坦的铜、铅、锌、银、镉等的蕴藏量，在苏联都占第一位。其中铜的蕴藏量占全苏联的一半以上，铅占四分之三，锌也占一半以上，银和镉的蕴藏量都占三分之二以上。此外，还有炼制镍、铝和其他稀有金属的原料。铁的蕴藏量已经超过乌拉尔和乌克兰，在苏联占第一位。中部卡拉干达煤矿区更是早已闻名的苏联第三个巨大产煤基地，仅次于顿巴斯和库兹巴斯。
    地大物博的哈萨克斯坦在苏维埃政权建立以前是沙皇俄国统治下的一个落后的殖民区，人民过着游牧生活，农业很不发达，工业几乎没有。广大的土地没有开垦，地下富源也没有探明，更谈不到开采了。十月革命后，从1928年到1930年，哈萨克斯坦消灭了封建制度的残余，在农业的社会主义改造和技术改造方面进行了巨大的工作，使全体游牧户都定居下来。这对哈萨克斯坦生产力的发展起了很大的推动作用。在苏维埃政权年代里，哈萨克斯坦逐渐从一个落后地区变成了经济发达的社会主义共和国，它的工农业都获得了巨大的发展。
    但是，尽管如此，哈萨克斯坦面积巨大的荒地还没有得到充分的开垦。哈萨克斯坦的雄厚的资源还没有得到充分的利用。近几年来苏联正在这些方面作积极的努力，一方面用大规模开垦荒地的办法来增加谷物播种面积，一方面执行大力开发东部的总方针来改善对生产力的配置。
    1954年，苏联共产党中央委员会发布了关于大量开垦荒地的历史性决议。这项决议对哈萨克共和国说来更有着划时代的意义。三年来这个共和国已开垦了二千万公顷荒地，新建了三百三十七个国营农场。播种面积已由1953年的九百七十万公顷扩大到今年的二千七百八十万公顷。这就不能不使哈萨克共和国的经济面貌发生重大的变化。这种变化已在今年的谷物大丰收中充分地表现出来。
    在第六个五年计划期间，哈萨克共和国还要继续开垦荒地，大力发展农业，要使这个共和国到1960年第六个五年计划完成时的谷物产量比1955年增加四倍。此外，到第六个五年计划完成时，甜菜要比1955年增加一点二倍，籽棉增加二点三倍，羊毛增加一点六倍，肉类增加半倍。哈萨克斯坦的饲畜业在苏联一向占着很重要的地位，羊的头数占全国第二位，牛和马的头数占第三位。同时共和国拥有的草原和山区牧场就有一亿七千多万公顷。从今年的谷物收获成就看来，第六个五年计划规定的共和国在农业和饲畜业方面的这些任务，无疑将会如期完成。那时，哈萨克共和国就要在小麦产量和羊毛采购量方面超过苏联其他主要经济地区而占到全国第一位了。
    为了进一步改进生产力的配置情况，在苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示中，曾着重提出要大力开发东部地区。在第六个五年计划中，用在发展东部地区的投资，几乎占国家全部投资的一半，而东部地区主要是指西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦。哈萨克共和国整个工业产量，在第六个五年计划中要增加一点二倍。这个数字比苏联任何一个加盟共和国都多。
    在第六个五年计划期间，首先要在库斯坦奈州建成一个巨大的索科洛夫斯克—萨尔巴依联合选矿厂。这两个地方的铁矿蕴藏量比乌拉尔还多。到1960年，哈萨克斯坦的这个联合选矿厂就能把五百六十万吨铁矿砂供给东部地区的各钢铁厂了。除库斯坦奈州外，卡拉干达州也是铁矿的主要产地。现在，在距卡拉干达不远的草原上正在建立巨大的卡拉干达钢铁厂。这个工厂将来不仅可以保证哈萨克斯坦对黑色金属的需要，还可以供应苏联的中亚细亚各共和国。
    巨大的冶金业需要大量的煤。哈萨克斯坦在第六个五年计划期间的煤产量应当增加60％。著名的卡拉干达矿区的生产能力在第六个五年计划中要扩大一倍。到1960年，它的煤产量将比革命前整个俄国的煤产量还多。哈萨克共和国还有一个著名的埃基巴兹图兹煤矿区。那里的煤层厚度超过一百公尺，而且全部可以用露天方法开采。现在计划要建筑十多个年产各数百万吨的大开采场。此外，库斯坦奈州新勘探出来的图尔加依大煤区，也要开始采掘。
    在注入里海的恩巴河流域盛产石油，产量在苏联占第四位，次于俄罗斯、阿塞拜疆和土库曼。第六个五年计划要把石油的开采量扩大40％，要新建两个大炼油厂。这样，就可以全部满足哈萨克共和国对石油产品的需要了。
    哈萨克共和国的有色冶金业也是在相当短的期间内建立起来的。在第六个五年计划中，除扩大现有的冶炼厂和选矿厂外，将在巴甫洛达州新发现的包兹沙库里铜矿产地新建一个大选矿厂。近年来又在库斯坦奈州发现了非常丰富的铝土矿，除了要建立几个大选矿厂外，还要在巴甫洛达尔建立一个苏联最大的制铝工厂。
    机器制造业也要随着冶金业的发展而大力发展。第六个五年计划期间，要在彼特罗巴甫洛夫斯克建立一个巨大的生产轧钢设备的重型机器制造厂，它的生产能力可以同著名的乌拉尔重型机器制造厂媲美。此外，还要建设联合收割机制造厂等共约二十个机器制造工厂。
    在苏维埃政权年代，哈萨克斯坦已建立起现代化的、高度机械化的纺织、针织、皮革等企业和食品工业。第六个五年计划中，除了要新建巨大的棉纺联合工厂、洗毛厂和皮革皮鞋联合工厂以外，还要建立十六个肉类联合工厂、三十三个机械化制油厂、十四个干酪制造厂等等。
    国民经济的进一步发展，要求有大量的动力。虽然哈萨克的电力生产在迅速增加，1955年的发电量已有五十七亿度，但是在一些工业中心仍感动力不足。所以在第六个五年计划中除建成东哈萨克斯坦州的布赫塔马水力枢纽外，还计划建筑两个强大的水电站，一个是额尔齐斯河上最大的舒里宾水电站，一个是卡普查盖水电站。
    目前，哈萨克斯坦的劳动人民正在满怀信心地执行着第六个五年计划。哈萨克共和国的生产力在第六个五年计划完成后将获得巨大的发展。共和国的经济状况也会空前繁荣起来。哈萨克共和国将变成一个农业和饲畜业都很发达的、拥有强大的工业的共和国。这样，哈萨克斯坦将成为苏联最大的工业基地和谷物基地之一，成为苏联共产主义建设的一个强有力的支柱。
