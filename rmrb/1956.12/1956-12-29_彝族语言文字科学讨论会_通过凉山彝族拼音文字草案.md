Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 27th: The Yi Language and Writing Academic Symposium, which closed on the 24th, passed a resolution on the draft plan for the Liangshan Yi phonetic script.

The more than 3.2 million Yi people living in the four provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou have considerably complex dialects and vernaculars. The meeting considered that under the current circumstances, it is impossible for all Yi people in the country to use one writing system. It is necessary to first determine a writing system for the northern dialect of Yi (i.e., the dialect of the Liangshan Yi area).

The Yi people in this dialect area number approximately 1.3 million.

The Liangshan Yi people originally had an old Yi script, which played a significant role in preserving and developing Liangshan Yi culture. However, there were many inconveniences in the form, vocabulary, and calligraphy, making it difficult to fully and effectively meet the needs of modern life in all aspects. Therefore, starting in 1951, some linguists, with the help of local people, developed an experimental phonetic script. The phonetic script plan (draft) passed by this meeting is based on the experimental phonetic script created at that time, with revisions and additions. The meeting pointed out that this phonetic script plan (draft) will greatly benefit the political, economic, and cultural development of the Liangshan Yi people and will also be of great help in solving the Yi script problems in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi.

The meeting believes that while reforming the Yi script, the original Yi script should be cherished and used to study the cultural heritage of the Yi people.

This meeting, which started on the 18th, was commissioned by the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China and held by the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee in Chengdu.

    彝族语言文字科学讨论会
    通过凉山彝族拼音文字草案
    据新华社成都27日电　24日闭幕的彝族语言文字科学讨论会，通过了关于凉山彝族拼音文字方案（草案）的决议。
    居住在四川、云南、广西、贵州四省的三百二十多万彝族人民，方言土语相当复杂。会议认为，在目前情况下，全国彝族不可能使用一种文字方案，先确定彝族北部方言（即凉山彝族地区的方言）的文字方案是必要的。
    在这部分方言区的彝族约有一百三十万人。
    凉山彝族原有一种老彝文，对保存和发展凉山彝族文化曾经起了重大作用。但是，字形、词汇和书法上有许多不便，很难充分有效地适应现代生活各方面的需要。因此，从1951年起，一些语言科学家在当地人民帮助下就制定了一种实验拼音文字。这次会议通过的拼音文字方案（草案），就是以当时创立的实验拼音文字为基础再加以修正补充而成的。会议指出：这个拼音文字方案（草案），将大大有利于凉山彝族人民的政治、经济、文化的发展，对于云南、贵州、广西彝族文字问题的解决，也将有很大的帮助。
    会议认为：在彝文进行改革的同时，对于原有彝文应该加以珍视，并通过它来研究彝族人民的文化遗产。
    这次会议从18日开始，是中华人民共和国民族事务委员会委托四川省人民委员会在成都召开的。
