Xinhua News Agency report: The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chongqing's handicraft management departments recently addressed the problems of excessively large handicraft cooperatives and the resulting overstaffed organizations and extravagance. They have proposed improvements.

It has now been decided that, except for some cooperatives suitable for centralized production, the majority of excessively large cooperatives will be adjusted and appropriately reduced in size based on the characteristics of the industry and the voluntary participation of members. Production will be organized in groups, or through contracting or output-based systems. The cooperative will uniformly establish necessary work quotas, consumption quotas, and product quality standards, and distribute raw materials to members for decentralized production. This will reduce non-production personnel by half, and increase the average monthly income of each member by approximately 10%.

The overlapping of upper-level management organizations in the Chongqing handicraft cooperative system is a major burden on grassroots cooperatives. This year alone, the municipal federation system relies on grassroots cooperatives to remit 250,000 yuan in administrative fees. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the municipal handicraft management departments are considering decentralizing management authority to the districts, strengthening the leadership role of the districts.

Due to blind centralization, the set of production management methods suitable for the characteristics of each industry and the excellent habit of utilizing waste materials and conserving raw materials, which handcrafts had formed in long-term production, were not maintained. In the future, "running cooperatives diligently and frugally" education will be conducted in depth among cooperative members, production management of cooperatives will be strengthened, and systems for improving technology, ensuring quality, and rewarding conservation will be established. Unreasonable wage systems are being adjusted.

### 重庆市整顿手工业合作组织  精简管理机构　增加社员收入

    重庆市整顿手工业合作组织
    精简管理机构　增加社员收入
    据新华社讯　中共重庆市委和重庆手工业管理部门最近对手工业合作社系统强求办大社，造成机构庞大、铺张浪费的问题，提出了改进办法。
    目前已经确定，除了一些适合于集中生产的合作社以外，多数规模过大的合作社要根据行业的特点和社员的自愿予以调整和适当划小，以小组为单位进行生产，或者采取包工、包产的办法，由合作社统一制定必要的工作定额、消耗定额和产品质量标准，发原料交给社员分散制作。这样，非生产人员可以减少一半，每个社员平均每月大约可以增加10％的收入。
    重庆市手工业合作社系统上层管理机构重叠，是基层社的一个重大负担。今年单是市联社系统依赖基层社上缴的行政费一项就有二十五万元。中共重庆市委员会和市手工业管理部门正考虑将管理权下放到区，加强区的领导作用。
    由于盲目集中，过去手工业在长期生产中形成的一套适合本行业特点的生产管理办法和善于利用废料、节约原材料的优良习惯没有得到保持。今后要在社员中深入进行“勤俭办社”的教育，加强合作社的生产管理，建立有关提高技术、保证质量和奖励节约的制度。对不合理的工资制度正在进行调整。
