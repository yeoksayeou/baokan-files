    The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Convenes Meeting of Industrial Cadres to Discuss Issues of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy and Political Work
    (Our Newspaper’s Dispatch) The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of Party member cadres from state-owned industrial enterprises from the 10th to the 12th of this month, focusing on discussions regarding the development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and political work.
    The attending enterprise Party committee secretaries and factory directors/managers unanimously agreed that although construction funds and raw material supplies are currently strained, there is great potential for production, and difficulties can be overcome. The current problems mainly lie in the serious phenomena of extravagance, waste, and emphasis on ostentation; some enterprise leading cadres also have varying degrees of thinking that only focuses on completing tasks, regardless of cost. According to incomplete statistics, the loss from defective products in just nine machinery factories reached 1.06 million yuan from January to September of this year. Some factories spent hundreds of yuan and traveled to major cities across the country to buy materials, taking more than two months, but the vast majority of materials were eventually purchased in Beijing and Tianjin. The organizations of various enterprises are also bloated, with too many people and overlapping responsibilities, leading to mutual interference in handling affairs and delays in resolving problems. One factory has thirty-eight departments; installing two street lights in the factory requires going through several departments such as supply, power, and accounting, and requires design and approval before construction can begin, taking more than a month to install these two street lights.
    In response to this situation, the comrades attending the meeting believed that before launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to first eliminate ideological obstacles and conduct education on hard work and plain living, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily; in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, special attention must be paid to improving quality, reducing costs, and streamlining organizations.
    The meeting believed that Party organizations should focus on the political and ideological education of workers and care for their lives. Since the call to "march towards science" was put forward, the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers in Beijing to study culture has been great, but political study has been relaxed, and a tendency to ignore politics has emerged. After discussion, everyone affirmed that it is a good phenomenon for workers to love learning technology and culture, and it should be promoted, but according to the actual situation of each factory, the time for cultural study should be appropriately reduced in the future to strengthen political and ideological education. Regarding the tendency of some workers to value welfare over production, on the one hand, we should care for them and help them solve difficult problems; on the other hand, we should also carry out ideological education to make them understand that diligence and thrift are the long-term policies for building socialism.

    中共北京市委召开工业干部会议
    讨论增产节约和政治工作问题
    本报讯　中共北京市委在本月10日到12日召开国营工业企业党员干部会议，着重讨论了开展增产节约运动和政治工作等问题。
    到会的企业党委书记和厂长、经理一致认为，当前建设资金和原材料供应虽然紧张，但是生产潜力很大，困难是可以克服的。目前存在的问题主要是铺张浪费、讲排场的现象严重；某些企业领导干部还有程度不同的只管完成任务，不顾成本的思想。据不完全的统计，仅在九个机器厂中，本年1至9月份废品损失就达一百零六万元。有的工厂为了买材料，花了几百元钱，跑遍全国各大城市，费了两个多月的时间，最后绝大部分材料还是在北京和天津买到的。各个企业的机构也很臃肿，人多手杂，办起事来相互牵扯，解决问题拖拉迟缓。有一个工厂有三十八个科室，在厂子里安装两盏路灯，要经过供给、动力、会计等几个科，还要先设计后审批才能施工，经过一个来月，才把这两盏路灯安装起来。
    针对这种情况，到会的同志认为在开展增产节约运动之前，必须首先排除思想障碍，进行艰苦朴素，勤俭办企业的教育；在增产节约运动中，必须特别注意提高质量，降低成本，精简机构。
    会议认为党组织应该抓紧职工的政治思想教育和关心职工的生活。自从提出“向科学进军”的号召后，北京市广大职工学习文化的劲头很大，但是放松了政治学习，出现了不问政治的倾向。经过讨论，大家肯定职工爱学技术和文化，是好现象，应当提倡，但是根据各厂的实际情况，今后应适当减少文化学习时间，加强政治思想教育。对有些职工目前存在着的重视福利轻视生产的倾向，应当一方面关心他们，帮助他们解决困难问题；另一方面也要向他们进行思想教育，使他们了解克勤克俭是建设社会主义的长远方针。
