　　This institute is located eleven miles from Pune. It studies how to solve problems such as training personnel, controlling rivers, removing quicksand, and improving navigation conditions in estuaries and harbors.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long visited six models of various hydropower projects and river control projects, which were carried out in accordance with the first and second five-year plans for the development of India. Premier Zhou Enlai visited the engineering models constructed on the ground, read charts, and asked many questions.

　　周总理参观印度水利和动力研究所
    据新华社孟买2日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理今天上午参观了印度中央水利和动力研究所。
    这个研究所距离浦那十一英里，它研究如何解决训练人员、控制河流、清除流沙、改善河口港湾航行条件和其他问题。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理参观了各种水力发电工程和河流控制工程的六种模型，这些工程都是根据第一个和第二个五年计划为了开发印度而进行的。周恩来总理参观了在地面上构筑的工程模型，阅览了图表，并且提出了许多问题。他对于治理柯西河的柯西河工程特别感到兴趣，柯西河很像中国的黄河，有“印度之患”之称。中央水利和动力委员会主席康瓦尔·赛义德说，他曾经到过中国，从中国治淮工程中学到了许多东西，并且在柯西河工程中运用了他所获得的经验。这时，周恩来插话说，中国也必须向印度学习许多东西。
    周恩来总理离开研究所的时候在来宾留言簿上写道：“我们很高兴地参观了中央水利和动力研究所。你们正在为你们的国家进行伟大的工作。我们愿意向你们学习。”
    随后，他们一行参观了浦那附近的平浦里的青霉素工厂。
