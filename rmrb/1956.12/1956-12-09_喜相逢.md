　　Happy Reunion
　　Hai Guo
　　After being criticized by the Party committee last night, Shen, the head of the Health Section, was in a bad mood. However, he still slept until after nine o'clock before getting up, and only lazily came to the office with his briefcase after ten. The annoyance had not completely driven out of his mind. He thought: Why does everyone say I have bureaucracy? — The unpleasant scene at the Party committee meeting last night floated before his eyes again. He pushed open the office door fiercely, as if he wanted to temporarily drive the annoyance out of his mind.

　　As soon as the office door opened, a pale-faced person stood up from the sofa. From the eager waiting in his eyes, a smile revealed that he had finally waited to see the person he wanted to see. While saying, "You are Section Chief Shen, I am...", he extended a thin hand, wanting to shake Section Chief Shen's fat hand.

　　Section Chief Shen stared at the pale face in front of him. Based on his instinct and inspiration as the head of the Health Section, he immediately determined that this must be another mischievous patient coming to trouble him. Therefore, without finishing listening to the other party's self-introduction, he used his fat hand to block the outstretched hand, pointed forcefully at the door, and shouted loudly: Go! Go away! Get out, I don't have time, go find a doctor if you have something, don't come here to make "trouble."

　　Dr. Li of the Health Section's directly affiliated clinic, who had been chased out, faced the door of Section Chief Shen's office, stunned. This morning, he had specially traveled twenty miles to find Section Chief Shen to discuss the hospitalization of a seriously ill patient. For more than two years, he had become accustomed to the various rumors about Section Chief Shen being difficult to see, but he had not expected to encounter such a thing today. In his anger, he had no choice but to stomp his feet and return to the clinic.

　　Afterwards, Section Chief Shen routinely forgot about this incident. On a rare nice day, Section Chief Shen excitedly took his wife in a small jeep to visit scenic spots. Although the afterglow of the trip was not yet exhausted, he already felt that his heart was willing but his strength was insufficient. He thought to himself that if he could have a cup of fragrant tea and a few snacks, that would be perfect. Following this thought, his eyes swept towards the storefronts on the street. As luck would have it, he caught a glimpse of the sign for the Health Section's directly affiliated clinic. He hurriedly told the driver to stop the car, and secretly laughed to himself: This is really what I wished for, go in and sit, fragrant tea and snacks... Besides, everyone says I have bureaucracy, isn't this a deep dive into the lower levels?

　　The clock on the wall in the clinic was already pointing to half-past eleven, and there were still eight patients waiting in the waiting room. Dr. Li, wearing a clean white isolation gown and a mask, was intently listening to a patient's lungs. Suddenly, he heard a loud voice in the waiting room shouting: "Who is the doctor in this clinic, where is he?" This piercing voice, which seemed to have been heard somewhere before, made Dr. Li pause. Looking closely, he immediately recognized the person who swaggered in as Section Chief Shen, who had chased him away half a month ago. He calmly replied, "That's me. Comrade, are you here to see a doctor? Please wait in the waiting room, see a doctor in order, don't just barge in." Section Chief Shen was very embarrassed by this unexpected "misunderstanding" and hurriedly explained that he was sent by the section to inspect the work. Dr. Li smiled and said, "That's good, please give me the introduction letter, and we'll talk after I've seen these patients." Section Chief Shen simply did not expect this trick, so he had to use an even louder voice to introduce himself, "I am Section Chief Shen of the Health Section," but the "Section Chief Shen" was used with a particularly heavy tone, but did not cause panic among his subordinates. Dr. Li pretended to ask with great suspicion: "Which Section Chief Shen are you, do you have an ID card?" Section Chief Shen was taken aback and became stunned... The subordinate does not respect the superior so much, this doctor does not even recognize his direct leader. What is this, what is this like? The veins on Section Chief Shen's neck were popping out one by one. In this embarrassing situation, he stomped his feet, turned around sharply, and ran to the jeep.

　　That night, Section Chief Shen convened a meeting of all staff members. He angrily accused: "In our place, there is such a strange phenomenon, a doctor who has worked for more than two years does not even recognize me, the section chief who leads the clinic, this is a most serious form of bureaucracy."

　　喜相逢
　　海果
    在昨晚受到党委会的批评以后，卫生科沈科长的情绪就很不好，但他仍然睡到了九点多钟才起床，十点以后才挟着公文包懒懒地来到办公室。烦恼还没有从他头脑中彻底驱走，他想：为什么人人都说我有官僚主义？——昨晚党委会上那种不愉快的情形，便又都浮上眼前，他狠狠地推开办公室的门，好像也要借此把烦恼暂且从头脑中赶走。
    办公室的门打开以后，紧接着从沙发上站起一个脸色苍白的人来。从那急切等待的眼光里，显露出终于等到了要见到的人那种微笑，一边说着“你是沈科长吧，我是……”同时伸出了一只削瘦的手，想来握住沈科长那只肥胖的手。
    沈科长把对面这张苍白的面孔盯了一下，凭着他卫生科长这种职务的本能和灵感，立即就断定这一定又是一个调皮的病人来找他的麻烦，于是他并没有听完对方的自我介绍，便用肥胖的大手把那只伸来的手挡开，用力的指向门口，大声的喝道：去！去去！快出去，我没有功夫，有事去找大夫，不要到这儿来找“麻烦”。
    被撵出来的卫生科直属门诊所的李大夫，面对着沈科长办公室的大门，一时呆若木鸡。他今天早晨特地跑了二十里路来找这位沈科长，要和他商量关于一个重病人住院的问题。两年多来，他已听惯了关于沈科长难见的种种传说，但他却还没有料到今天会有这样的遭遇。他在气愤之余，便只好顿顿脚返回门诊所去。
    过后，沈科长照例地把这件事忘到九霄云外去了。在一个难得的好天气里，沈科长兴致勃勃地带了爱人，坐着小吉普车去游览名胜，游罢归来的途中，余兴虽然未尽，但已感心有余而力不足了。心想那里能有香茶一盏，点心少许，这就正得其时了。顺着这思想，眼便扫向街旁的门面，正是无巧不成书，他一眼便瞥见卫生科直属门诊所的牌子。他一面急忙招呼司机停车。一面暗自好笑地想：这可真是天随人意，进去坐坐，香茶点心……再说，人人都说我官僚主义，这不正是深入下层来了吗？
    门诊所里墙上的挂钟，已指向了十一点半，候诊室里还守候有八个待诊的病人。李大夫穿着一身洁白的隔离衣，带着口罩，正在全神贯注地给一个病人听诊。突然听到候诊室里一个大嗓门喊道：“谁是这门诊所里的大夫，他在那里？”这仿佛在那里听到过的刺耳的声音，使李大夫怔了一下，定睛一看，马上认出了这个大摇大摆闯进来的人，正是在半个月前撵走他的那个沈科长。他不慌不忙地回答说：“我就是。同志，你是来看病的吗？请在候诊室里等一等，看病要按次序，不要随便闯进来。”沈科长被这意外的“误会”弄得很尴尬，慌忙说明自己是科里派来检查工作的。李大夫笑了笑说：“那可好，请把介绍信给我，等我看完这些病人咱们谈一谈。”沈科长简直没有想到这一招，便不得不用更大的嗓门来自我介绍说，“我是卫生科的沈科长”，但是用了特别重音的“沈科长”三个字却并没有引起他部下的惊慌，李大夫装得十分狐疑的问道：“你是哪个沈科长，有身分证吗？”沈科长被将军得一时也就呆若木鸡，……下级如此不尊重上级，这医生竟不认识自己的直接领导人。这，这像什么话？沈科长被气的脖子上的青筋都一根根地蹦起来了。在这下不来台的情景中，他顿顿脚急转回身，奔上吉普车去。
    当天晚上，沈科长召开了一个全体工作人员的大会，他怒气冲冲地指责说：“在我们这里，竟有这样的奇怪现象，一个工作了两年多的大夫，竟连我这领导门诊所的科长都不认识，这真是一种最严重的官僚主义。”（附图片）
