Xinhua News Agency, December 21st (New York Dispatch): Indian Prime Minister Nehru, after concluding his talks in Washington, left Washington by plane on the morning of the 20th and arrived in New York.

    Nehru's activities in New York on the 20th included attending a luncheon hosted by New York City Mayor Wagner, attending a private banquet held by Mrs. Roosevelt for him, and delivering a speech at the United Nations in the evening.

    Nehru delivered a speech at Wagner's luncheon. In his speech, he praised the United States. He also believed that saying the United States and India have "major differences" on international and other issues is "too exaggerated."

He reiterated India's desire for peace, compassion, and goodwill.

    Nehru is scheduled to stay in New York until the afternoon of the 21st, and then leave New York by plane for a visit to Canada.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 21st (London Dispatch): Hope, the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, announced in the House of Commons on the 20th that Indian Prime Minister Nehru, on his way back home after visiting the United States and Canada, will stop in London and hold talks with British Prime Minister Eden.
