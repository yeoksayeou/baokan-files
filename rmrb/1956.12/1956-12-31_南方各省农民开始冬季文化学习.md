Xinhua News Agency: Rural amateur cultural schools in southern provinces and cities began classes successively in mid-December. Currently, there are five million farmers in Jiangsu Province attending various amateur cultural schools. In Henan Province, more than 3.05 million farmers have participated in winter cultural studies. In Anhui Province, more than 1.4 million farmers are participating in civil school studies, and more than 1.6 million are about to enroll. Many farmers in Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other places also participate in amateur schools and literacy classes.

This year, the southern provinces and cities are adopting a variety of teaching forms for farmers' amateur education based on the principle of adapting to local conditions. In Anhui Province, teaching is closely integrated with winter sideline production in disaster areas. For migrant workers participating in winter farmland water conservancy projects, civil school teachers follow them to the embankment to teach. In non-disaster areas, teaching is mainly based on the class system. The Gaoyao Special District of Guangdong Province implements fixed time, fixed funds, and fixed teachers according to local conditions to improve teaching quality. Yulin County, Guangxi Province, uses the "four-ring" method of teaching elementary school level with junior high school level, teaching semi-literate with elementary school level, and teaching illiterate with semi-literate, so that everyone has a teacher and everyone learns culture. This method is being widely adopted in Guangxi Province.

    南方各省农民开始冬季文化学习
    新华社讯　南方各省市农村业余文化学校在12月中旬陆续开学。目前江苏省已有五百万农民在各种业余文化学校上课。河南省已经有三百零五万多农民参加冬季文化学习。安徽省各地农民参加民校学习的有一百四十多万人，还有一百六十多万人也即将入学。江西、四川、云南、广东、浙江、上海等地也有很多农民参加业余学校和识字班学习。
    今年南方各省市对农民的业余教育都是根据因地制宜的原则，采用多种教学形式。安徽省在灾区密切结合冬季副业生产进行教学，对参加冬季农田水利工程的民工，民校教师都跟着上堤教学。在非灾区就以班级制为主进行教学。广东省高要专区根据当地具体条件，实行固定时间、固定经费和固定教师的办法，以提高教学质量。广西省玉林县采用以初中程度教小学程度、小学程度教半文盲、半文盲教文盲的“四连环”办法，做到了普遍有老师，大家学文化。这个办法正被广西省广泛采用。
