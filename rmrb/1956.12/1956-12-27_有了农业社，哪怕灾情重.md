One afternoon, as the sun was about to set, we arrived at the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Mucun, a severely affected area in Anyang County, Henan Province. In the wheat fields by the village, groups of three or five female cooperative members were using windlasses and waterwheels to draw water and irrigate the wheat. Watered, the wheat seedlings looked even greener and stronger. Many male cooperative members were plowing the land. Dozens of large carts, freshly loaded with coal, were parked in the village, and cooperative members were cheerfully carrying baskets of coal from the carts to their homes. At the entrance of the supply and marketing cooperative branch store, cooperative members who had been cutting grass crowded around, selling the grass to the branch store. Elementary school students were walking home from school with their schoolbags on their backs, skipping and jumping. All this was a bit beyond our expectations. We knew in advance that this was a severely affected cooperative where the actual harvest of autumn crops was on average 86.4% lower than the planned production target. We thought that with such a severe disaster, the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members would not be very high, but the reality was not like that.

After visiting, we learned that although the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative suffered severe losses this autumn due to the disaster, after three months of production and disaster relief work, by November 15, 88% of the losses had been made up. How could this not greatly encourage the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members! Therefore, winter production has started in full swing again.

Caring for the Present and the Future
The Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative was formed in January of this year by ten elementary cooperatives and some individual farmers into an advanced cooperative. The whole cooperative has 426 households. In August, there was continuous heavy rain here for a long time, and more than 2,900 mu of cotton and more than 5,000 mu of autumn grain crops in the entire cooperative were completely flooded, and 375 houses also collapsed. The situation at the time was "water everywhere you go." This caused the cooperative cadres and members to feel seriously threatened in terms of production and life. Some cooperative members complained that they should not have joined the cooperative; some cooperative cadres were afraid that the cooperative members would follow them asking for food and wanted to hide away; both the cooperative cadres and members were prepared to go out and make a living on their own. The cooperative could be said to be in chaos.

At that time, the cooperative's Communist Party branch and management committee held separate meetings to discuss leading the cooperative members in production for self-salvation. During the discussion, there were two opposing views: some people advocated concentrating efforts on leading the cooperative members to sow wheat, on the grounds that if the wheat could not be sown in a timely manner, there would be no wheat to harvest next summer, and the cooperative members would still suffer from famine; others advocated concentrating efforts on leading the cooperative members to engage in sideline production, on the grounds that the cooperative members had not received grain in the autumn, and if they did not concentrate efforts on engaging in sideline production, they would not be able to make a living, and also, the houses of more than 100 cooperative members had collapsed, and the houses of 55 of them needed to be repaired in a timely manner, and if they were not repaired, there would be no place to live in the immediate future, so how could the cooperative members have the mind to sow wheat? After a heated debate, by comparing the accounts of agricultural and sideline income, everyone finally clearly realized that agricultural production must be the main focus, while taking into account sideline production. Therefore, the management committee made a resolution to "clarify the disaster situation, comprehensively arrange agricultural and sideline production, and comprehensively arrange the economic life of the cooperative members."

Starting from the requirement of saving and surviving the famine, they calculated the necessary expenses of the entire cooperative from October of this year to the end of May next year and the possible income from cotton and residual autumn crops in agricultural production. Expenses minus income was the cooperative's task of production and disaster relief, totaling 54,357 yuan. The cooperative affairs committee announced the task to all cooperative members, so that all cooperative cadres and members knew the bottom line. Then, the state's allocated living relief funds were distributed to households with greater living difficulties at present; the state's allocated funds for repairing houses were also distributed to households whose houses had collapsed and needed to be repaired urgently. In this way, the emotions of the cooperative cadres and members were initially stabilized.

Comprehensive Arrangement of Labor and Animal Power
How to comprehensively arrange agricultural and sideline production? They arranged the entire cooperative's 998 male and female full and half laborers according to their labor strength, technical level, and different businesses, and made a labor plan before the Spring Festival: a total of 470 laborers were engaged in agricultural production, 230 laborers with skills were engaged in sideline production, 98 laborers were used as manual laborers, and the remaining 200 laborers were used to repair houses for the cooperative members and take turns engaging in household sideline production. A comprehensive arrangement was also made for the entire cooperative's 190 head of livestock. Among them, 46 head of small livestock raised by cooperative members themselves were used as household animal power for the cooperative members' families; the livestock within the cooperative were used intensively for wheat sowing during the wheat sowing period, and after the wheat sowing was completed, strong livestock were drawn out to engage in transportation, and the remaining were used in agriculture and in-home sideline production. On the basis of making a comprehensive plan for labor and animal power, they also helped the cooperative members to formulate production and disaster relief plans household by household; then, according to the agricultural and sideline labor days reported by each household and the different types of sideline businesses they were engaged in, they were organized separately, and at the same time, the cooperative's sideline production plan was revised. The cooperative uniformly managed 13 kinds of sideline businesses with larger-scale operations, such as brick and tile kilns, transportation, and cotton ginning, and the cooperative members managed 4 kinds of sporadic and scattered sideline businesses, such as cutting grass, carrying loads, collecting manure, and purchasing waste products.

With a comprehensive plan, the cooperative cadres and members felt bright in their hearts and established the confidence to eliminate the disaster before the Spring Festival. The entire cooperative, regardless of men, women, old, or young, actively took action.

Formulate Reasonable Sideline Labor Remuneration Standards
When the cooperative members actively took action, the cooperative management committee found that the cooperative members had varying degrees of ideological concerns: the cooperative members who did agricultural work were worried that they would not be able to share the dividends of sideline production and would not be able to solve the current living problems; the cooperative members who did sideline work were worried that they would not be able to share wheat next summer. In response to the ideological concerns of the cooperative members, the cooperative management committee convened a cooperative members' meeting to discuss and pass a resolution on unified profit distribution for agricultural and sideline production, and at the same time, formulated a method of quota remuneration and timely profit distribution.

Due to the many types of sideline businesses operated within the cooperative and the lack of experience in quota work, the initial sideline quotas were not formulated reasonably enough. Therefore, on some days, the attendance rate of some cooperative members engaged in collective sideline businesses was very low; some cooperative members were unwilling to go out to work; and some sideline businesses everyone was willing to engage in, and those who did agricultural work were uneasy, thinking that they were at a disadvantage. After discovering this problem, the management committee promptly arranged all the types of sideline businesses operated by the cooperative according to the degree of labor intensity, technical level, and agricultural work, and re-formulated the quotas and remuneration standards for sideline labor, which were finalized after several revisions by the cooperative members' meeting. For example, agricultural plowing and sideline brick making are heavy and technical work and are considered a type of work, and completing a quota is recorded as 11 work points; weeding and manual labor are considered a second type of work, and completing a quota is recorded as 10 work points, and so on.

The Threat of Famine Has Been Basically Lifted
The recording of work points for sideline production is basically reasonable, and the cooperative members engaged in agricultural and sideline production have no objections. At the same time, the cooperative distributed 9,800 yuan of profits from sideline production to the cooperative members according to the number of agricultural and sideline labor days of each cooperative member, which greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. By October 8, the entire cooperative had completed the sowing task of 4,850 mu of wheat (250 mu more than last year); and cut 286,000 jin of dry grass for feeding livestock. The cooperative only lacked 190,000 jin of grass for livestock, and also supported other disaster-stricken cooperatives with more than 90,000 jin of livestock feed. Because of the sufficient feed and the improvement of feeding management, not only did the cooperative's 144 head of livestock not become weak after the disaster, but also 50% of the livestock gained weight. At the same time, more than 80 collapsed houses have been built, and more than 170 have been repaired, and the cooperative members' housing problems have been solved in a timely manner. By November 17, the cooperative had accumulated 1,200 carts of grass fertilizer, and the cooperative members had delivered 18,000 jin of manure to the cooperative, and there was also a way to apply topdressing fertilizer to wheat. In terms of sideline businesses, from August 20 to November 17, the cooperative's collective sideline production earned 24,290 yuan, and the cooperative members' individual sideline production earned 11,434 yuan. Added to the 34,397 yuan from the actual harvest of part of the cotton and residual autumn crops in agricultural production, the total income was 70,121 yuan, accounting for more than 88% of the total expenses calculated by the cooperative from October of this year to the end of May next year. Of the entire cooperative's 426 households, calculating an average living expense of 3 yuan per person per month (including grain, oil, and salt), 311 households—accounting for 73% of the total number of households in the cooperative—can maintain their lives until the end of May next year with the cooperative's profit distribution and individual sideline production income, and the threat of famine has been lifted. It is no longer a problem to strive to completely make up for the losses caused by the disaster before the Spring Festival.

    有了农业社，哪怕灾情重
    本报记者　王昌隆
    一天下午，太阳快要落山的时候，我们到了河南省安阳县重灾区的慕村光明农业生产合作社。村边的麦田里，三、五成群的女社员正在用辘轳、水车提水浇麦。麦苗经水浇过，越发显得嫩绿、茁壮。许多男社员正在耕地。村里停放着几十辆刚刚满载燃煤回来的大车，社员们说笑着一筐一筐从车上把煤往各自家里抬。供销合作社分销店的门口，拥挤着割草回来的社员们，他们正在把草卖给分销店。学校里的小学生，正背着书包一蹦一跳地往家里走。这一切情景，有点出乎我们的意料。我们事先知道这是个秋作物实收比三定产量平均减产86.4％的重灾社。我们以为，受灾这样重，社员的生产情绪一定不会很高，没想到事实并不如此。
    访问以后，我们才了解到：光明农业社今年秋季虽然遭灾受了严重损失，但是经过三个来月的生产救灾工作，到11月15日算大账，88％的损失已经弥补起来。这怎能不大大鼓舞社员们的生产积极性！因此，冬季生产又热烘烘地搞起来了。
    顾眼前也顾将来
    光明农业生产合作社是今年一月由十个初级社和部分个体农民组成的高级社。全社四百二十六户。八月间这里连续下了很长时间的大雨，全社二千九百多亩棉花、五千多亩秋季粮食作物完全被水淹没，三百七十五间房屋也倒塌了。当时的情景是“出门一片水”。这使社干部、社员在生产上生活上感到严重的威胁。有的社员埋怨自己不该入社；有的社干部怕社员跟着要吃的，想躲出去；社干部、社员都有准备各自出外谋生的。社里可以说是一片混乱。
    那时候，社里的中共支部和管理委员会分别召开了会议，讨论领导社员进行生产自救。在讨论当中，有两种意见相持不下：有人主张集中力量领导社员播种小麦，理由是如果小麦不能适时种好，明年夏天就收不到小麦，社员仍然要闹饥荒；有人主张集中力量领导社员搞副业生产，理由是秋季社员没分到粮食，如果不集中力量搞副业生产生活就过不去，而且，一百多户社员的房屋倒塌了，其中有五十五户的房屋需要及时修盖，不修盖眼下就没有住处，社员那会有心思去种麦呢？经过一番热烈的争论，通过算农业副业收入的对比账，大家终于明确地认识了必须以农业生产为主，兼顾副业生产。于是，管理委员会作出了“澄清灾情，全面安排农业副业生产，全面安排社员经济生活”的决议。
    他们从节约度荒的要求出发，计算出全社从今年10月到明年5月底必要的开支和农业生产上棉花和残秋的可能收入。开支扣去收入，就是全社的生产救灾任务，计折款为五万四千三百五十七元。社务委员会向全体社员宣布了任务，使所有社干部和社员都摸了底。然后将国家拨给的生活救济款发给眼下生活困难较大的户；对房屋倒塌急需修盖的户，也发放了国家拨付的修盖房屋款。这样，社干部和社员的情绪初步稳定下来了。
    全面安排劳力畜力
    怎样全面安排农业副业生产呢？他们把全社的九百九十八个男女整半劳动力，根据劳力强弱、技术高低和不同的业务加以安排，作出了春节以前的劳动规划：计抽四百七十个劳力从事农业生产，二百三十个有技术的劳动力经营副业，九十八个劳动力作力工，其余二百个劳力给社员修盖房屋和轮流搞家庭副业生产。对全社一百九十头牲口也作了全面安排。其中社员自养的小牲口四十六头，作为社员家庭自用畜力；社内牲口在种麦期间，集中使用在种麦上，种麦结束以后，抽健壮牲口出外搞运输，余下的用在农业上和在家的副业上。在劳力畜力作了全面规划的基础上，又帮助社员逐户制定了生产救灾计划；然后再根据各户自报的农副业劳动日，以及所经营副业的不同种类，分别加以组织，同时修正全社的副业生产计划。社内统一经营规模较大的烧砖瓦窑、运输、轧花等十三种副业，社员经营零星分散的割草、担挑、拾粪、收购废品等四种副业。
    有了全面规划，社干部、社员都觉得心里亮了，树立起在春节前消灭灾荒的信心。全社无分男女老少，都积极行动起来了。
    制定合理的副业劳动计酬标准
    在社员们积极行动起来的时候，社管理委员会发现社员都各有程度不同的思想顾虑：做农业活的社员，担心分不到副业生产的红利，不能解决当前生活问题；做副业活的社员，又担心明年夏天分不到小麦。社管理委员会针对社员的思想顾虑，召集社员大会讨论通过了农业副业生产统一分红的决议，同时，制定了定额计酬、及时分红的办法。
    由于社内经营副业种类多，定额工作缺乏经验，最初副业定额制定得不够合理。因此，有些天，有些搞集体副业的社员出勤率很低；有些社员不愿出去做工；也有些副业大家都愿去搞，做农业活的就不安心，认为自己吃亏了。管理委员会发现这个问题以后，及时依照农业定额标准，把全社经营的副业种类，根据劳动强度、技术高低的程度和农业活统一排队，重新制定了副业劳动的定额和报酬标准，经过几次社员大会修正才确定下来。如农业耕地和副业打砖坯活重，又带技术性算一类活，完成一个定额记十一工分；锄地和力工算二类活，完成一个定额记十工分，等等。
    灾荒的威胁基本解除了
    副业生产的记工基本上合理了，从事农业副业生产的社员都没意见了。同时，社里又把副业生产已得红利九千八百元，按各个社员农、副业劳动日多少统一分给社员，这就大大提高了社员的生产积极性。到10月8日，全社已完成了四千八百五十亩小麦的播种任务（比去年多种二百五十亩）；并割了喂牲口的干草二十八万六千斤。社里牲口只缺草十九万斤，还余九万多斤牲口饲草支援别的受灾社。因为饲草充足，加上饲养管理的改善，社里的一百四十四头牲口受灾后不仅没有瘦弱下去，而且50％的牲口长了膘。同时，倒塌了的房子已盖起八十多间，有一百七十多间进行了修补，社员的居住问题及时地解决了。到11月17日，社内已积草肥一千二百车，社员拾粪交社的一万八千斤，小麦施追肥也有了办法。在副业方面，从8月20日到11月17日，社的集体副业生产获利二万四千二百九十元，社员个人副业生产获利一万一千四百三十四元。加上农业生产方面部分棉花和残秋实收折款三万四千三百九十七元，共收入七万零一百二十一元，占今年10月到明年5月底全社计算总开支数的88％强。全社四百二十六户社员，每人每月生活费平均按三元钱计算（包括粮食、油、盐），已有三百一十一户——占全社总户数73％的社员，用社的分红和个人副业生产所得，可以维持生活到明年5月底，解除了灾荒的威胁。争取在春节前完全把因灾荒造成的损失弥补起来，已经不成问题了。
