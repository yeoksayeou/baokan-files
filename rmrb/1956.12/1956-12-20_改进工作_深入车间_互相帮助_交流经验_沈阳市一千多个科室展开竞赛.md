    Improving Work, Going Deep into Workshops, Helping Each Other, Exchanging Experiences
    More Than 1,000 Departments in Shenyang Launch Competition
    (Our Newspaper News) This year, the inter-factory and intra-factory department competitions in state-owned and local state-owned factories in Shenyang have greatly developed, playing a significant role in improving enterprise management.
    Since the Shenyang First Machinery Trade Union organized various machinery factories to launch a "no error design" and "excellent inspector" department competition at the beginning of this year, nine industrial trade unions, including heavy industry and light industry, have successively launched inter-factory same-department competitions. Currently, 208 factories and 1,488 departments have participated in inter-factory competitions. Among these factories, about one-third of the departments have also organized intra-factory department-to-department competitions. Except for the security department and the personnel department, production, technology, finance, and other departments have participated in the competition.
    Inter-factory same-business competitions have promoted mutual learning and exchange of advanced experiences among factories. Machinery factories have exchanged more than 150 types of advanced experiences such as no-error design, regional mobile circular inspection, and quota-based material distribution. For example, after exchanging the advanced experiences of the tool departments of Shenyang Second and First Machine Tool Factories, the 14 tool departments participating in the competition refurbished waste tools in the third quarter, saving more than 160,000 yuan of wealth.
    Department competitions have also promoted the improvement of department work and strengthened the cooperation between departments and workshops. For example, the process department of the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory mobilized technical personnel to go deep into the workshops to modify and compile process regulations based on the advanced experiences and rationalization proposals of workers. As a result of modifying the process on 250 parts of 12 types of products, 2.4 kilograms of steel can be saved per product.
    Due to the development of inter-factory same-business competitions, a new atmosphere of mutual assistance has been formed among factories. The Shenyang Medical Equipment Factory began trial-producing electric refrigerators in the third quarter of last year. Because some technical problems were not resolved, it could not be officially put into production until April of this year. During the competition, the Shenyang Transformer Factory, the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory, and the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory organized engineers and technicians to actively help them. In October, the factory finally manufactured 50 qualified electric refrigerators. At present, this activity has developed into signing mutual learning and assistance contracts in some units. In the machinery system, 14 inter-factory department mutual learning and assistance contracts have now been signed.

### 改进工作  深入车间　互相帮助　交流经验  沈阳市一千多个科室展开竞赛

    改进工作  深入车间　互相帮助　交流经验
    沈阳市一千多个科室展开竞赛
    本报讯　今年沈阳市国营和地方国营工厂的厂际和厂内的科室竞赛，有很大的发展，对改进企业管理工作有显著的作用。
    自今年年初沈阳市第一机械工会组织各机械工厂开展无错误设计和优秀检查员的科室竞赛以来，相继有重工、轻工等九个产业工会开展了厂际同科室竞赛。目前已参加厂际竞赛的有二百零八个工厂、一千四百八十八个科室。在这些工厂中，约有三分之一的科室还组织了厂内科与科的竞赛，除了保卫科和人事科外，生产、技术、财务等科室都参加了竞赛。
    厂际同业务竞赛推动了各厂之间互相学习、交流先进经验的活动。机械工厂交流了无错误设计、区域流动巡环检查、限额发料等一百五十多种先进经验。如交流了沈阳第二和第一机床厂工具科的先进经验后，第三季中参加竞赛的十四个工具科进行了废具翻新，节约了十六万多元的财富。
    科室竞赛也督促了科室工作的改进，并加强了科室与车间的协作。如沈阳风动工具厂工艺科发动技术人员深入车间，根据工人的先进经验和合理化建议来修改和编制工艺规程。在十二种产品的二百五十个部件上修改工艺的结果，使一台产品可以节省钢材二点四公斤。
    由于厂际同业务竞赛的开展，形成了各厂之间互相帮助的新风气。沈阳医疗器械厂从去年第三季度就开始试制电气冰箱。因为有些技术问题没有解决，到今年4月还不能正式生产。在竞赛中，沈阳变压器厂、沈阳高压开关厂和沈阳空气压缩机厂三个厂组织了工程师和技术员，主动去帮助他们。10月份，这个工厂终于制造出了五十台合格的电气冰箱。目前这种活动已在部分单位发展成为签订互学互助合同。在机械系统中，现在已签定了十四份厂际科室互学互助合同。
