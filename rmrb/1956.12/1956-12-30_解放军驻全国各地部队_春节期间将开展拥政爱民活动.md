Xinhua News Agency, December 29th – People's Liberation Army (PLA) units stationed across the country will extensively carry out activities to support the government and cherish the people during the New Year and Spring Festival period. Recently, the leading organs of the garrisons in various regions have issued instructions to their subordinate units.

According to the requirements of these instructions, officers and soldiers of all units will first conduct a "Support the Government and Cherish the People" study and conscientiously carry out the inspection of mass discipline. The troops will take the initiative to solicit opinions from local Party and government organs and organize personnel to conduct investigations and visits among the people. After thorough inspection, the troops will commend and reward units or individuals who have done well in abiding by policies, laws, and regulations and protecting the interests of the masses. For events that violate policies, laws, and regulations and infringe upon the interests of the masses, they will be dealt with promptly and correctly.

During the New Year and Spring Festival, all units will also hold get-togethers with local Party and government organs and the people and extend New Year greetings to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and agricultural producers' cooperatives. Many units will also send out literary and artistic work groups or soldier literary and artistic organizations to perform for local Party and government organs and the masses, and some units will screen films, depending on the actual situation.

In their instructions, the leading organs of the PLA units stationed in various regions also required their subordinate units to contact the local government and draw up plans for the troops to support the people's production and construction next year. Officers and soldiers should write letters to their relatives and friends, encouraging them to run cooperatives diligently and frugally, cherish the cooperatives like their own homes, actively work, and increase production. Officers should also strive to be thrifty and send money home to support their relatives in order to reduce the burden on the state and the people.

    解放军驻全国各地部队
    春节期间将开展拥政爱民活动
    新华社29日讯　中国人民解放军驻全国各地部队将在新年到春节期间，广泛地开展一次拥政爱民活动。最近，各地驻军领导机关已先后向所属部队发出指示。
    根据这些指示的要求，各部队官兵将首先进行一次“拥政爱民”学习，并认真地做好群众纪律的检查工作。部队将主动地向驻地党政机关征求意见，并组织人员深入人民群众中进行调查访问。在深入检查以后，部队对遵守政策法令和爱护群众利益好的单位或个人进行表扬、奖励，对某些违反政策法令和侵犯群众利益的事件，及时正确地处理。
    各部队还将在新年春节期间，同驻地党政机关和人民举行联欢会，向烈、军属和农业生产合作社拜年。许多部队并将根据实际情况，派出文艺工作团体或战士文艺组织给驻地党政机关和人民群众演出，有些部队将放映电影。
    解放军驻各地部队领导机关在指示中，还要求所属部队应该同当地政府联系，订出部队明年支援人民生产建设的计划。官兵们要写信给自己的亲友，鼓励他们勤俭办社，爱社如家，积极劳动，增加生产。军官们并要努力节俭，寄钱回家赡养亲属，以减轻国家和人民的负担。
