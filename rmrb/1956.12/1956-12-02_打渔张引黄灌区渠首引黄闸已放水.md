　　打渔张引黄灌区渠首引黄闸已放水
    据新华社讯　不久前完工的山东打渔张引黄灌区的渠首引黄闸，11月30日举行了放水典礼。
    30日一早，建筑工人、学生、机关干部和附近的农民敲锣打鼓向引黄闸汇集，欢悦的气氛洋溢着每个角落。
    上午十一点，放水典礼开始，由山东省副省长王卓如剪彩。
    剪彩以前，举行了有一千五百多人参加的庆祝大会。中华人民共和国水利部副部长何基澧在会上致词说：山东打渔张引黄灌溉工程是根据根治黄河综合规划的方针举办的第一期灌溉工程之一。这个工程的兴建不仅对开发灌溉山东省广饶、博兴两县的三百二十四万亩土地有着很大作用，同时还为整个黄河下游大规模的开发灌溉工程培养了技术干部和积累了经验。
