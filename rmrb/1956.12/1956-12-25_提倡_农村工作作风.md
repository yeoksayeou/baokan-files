    Advocating the “Rural Work Style”
    Su Shi
    Recently I received a letter from a factory director, with the following paragraph at the end:
    "To understand the situation of our employees, we have established a system in our factory: holding a weekly employee symposium. We have already held five: one for Shanghai workers, one for Hunan workers, one for demobilized soldiers, and one for technicians and one for fitters. We plan to continue holding them according to employee types. Each meeting lasts one or two hours, with only four or five people participating, chaired by the factory director or party secretary. As long as we put down our airs and talk to them like brothers, they will talk about everything. They have difficulties in their lives, problems in their work, and opinions about the leadership. Everyone has some very practical problems that need to be solved, and if they don't say it, we will never know the specifics. Of course, there are also some unreasonable demands, and even complaints. But as long as we explain the truth clearly, they can recognize their mistakes and forgive the difficulties of the enterprise and the country. The important thing is that if it can be done, we should promise and do it immediately. Never break our promise..."
    This is really a good system. I heard that many factories have done this, although they have different forms. I believe that this system of contacting the masses will be universally promoted in factories across the country.
    Caring about the lives of the workers is a very important condition for running a factory well. Because no matter how advanced or backward the factory's technical equipment is, to hope that this technical equipment will function and produce products, it depends on the labor of people (workers and staff); and the "work" done by a dedicated person is always better than that done by an absent-minded person, even if the technology of these two people is exactly the same. This is a fact. A factory, of course, has more than just two workers, but thousands upon thousands of people working. To make these thousands upon thousands of people work with all their hearts and minds, what a meticulous and difficult thing it is. Therefore, the responsibility of a factory director, on the surface, is to complete the state's production tasks, but in essence, it can be said that it is to do the work of "people," that is, to do the work of understanding people and caring for people.
    Now, most of the comrades who are factory directors and party secretaries in the factories have done peasant work, and many can truly be regarded as experts in peasant mass work. At that time, in order to overthrow a landlord, how much meticulous and arduous work did we do among the peasant masses! Peasants are not a simple class; but we not only know the characteristics of each type of person, but also almost every person's words and deeds, worries and joys on the issue of fighting the landlord, we are all very familiar with. Why is this? It's because we are truly integrated with them and have done serious investigation and research work on them.
    It has been seven years since we moved from the countryside to the cities and factories. Are we as familiar with the workers in the factories as we were with the peasants in the past? I am afraid that only a very few factory directors or party secretaries dare to stand up and give an affirmative answer.
    Knowing people and being good at using them, knowing soldiers and being good at commanding them; shouldn't the factory director be familiar with the workers?
    The Chinese working class is a class that is developing every day: some have just transferred from the army, some have just put down their hoes, some have just picked up axes and planes, some have drifted around in society doing other professions, and some have no profession; not to mention the old workers. Aren't the thoughts and consciousness of these people all kinds of different? Even if they have worked in the factory for eight or ten years and are really like a worker, aren't their lives and thoughts still like their faces, with many small differences within the great similarities? In order to organize them to carry out production well, we must rely on them; and to rely on them closely, we must first care about them and be familiar with them, right?
    Some years ago, some people criticized the so-called "rural work style," but somehow, a gust of wind blew away the fine traditions in rural work; caring about the lives of the masses is one of the victims. It is time to pick up these good things again. Maybe someone will say: the factory is too busy, there are so many people, it is impossible to do it like in the countryside. This is a lie. It can be done, the words of the factory director above are evidence.

    提倡“农村工作作风”
    素石
    最近接到一个工厂厂长的一封信，信末有这么一段话：
    “为了熟悉职工的情况，我们厂里建立了一种制度，就是每星期开一次职工座谈会。已经开了五次：一次上海工人的，一次湖南工人的，一次转业军人的，还开了一次技术员的和一次钳工的。我们还打算按职工类型分别地开下去。一次会的时间一二小时，参加会的不过四五人，由厂长或党委书记主持。只要我们把架子放下，像兄弟一样和他们谈问题，他们是无话不谈的。他们的生活有困难，工作中有问题，对领导有意见。每一个人都有一些很实际的问题，须要帮助解决，要是不说，我们是永远不会知道那么具体的。当然也有些不合理的要求，甚至还有抱怨。但是只要把道理讲明白，他们能够认识自己的不对，也能够原谅企业和国家的困难。要紧的是能办的，答应了就马上办。千万不可失信……”
    这实在是一种好制度。听说有不少工厂都这样做了，虽然各有各的形式。我相信，这种联系群众的制度在全国工厂里都会普遍推行起来。
    关心职工群众生活，这是办好工厂的一个很重要条件。因为不论工厂的技术装备先进或落后，要希望这些技术装备产生作用，制出产品，就得靠人（工人和职员）的劳动；而一个专心致志的人做出来的“活”，总比一个心不在焉的人所做的要好，即使这两个人的技术完全一样。这是事实。一个工厂，自然不只两个工人，而是成千上万的人在劳动。要使这成千上万的人，工作起来，都是专心一意，该是如何细致烦难的事情。因此，一个厂长，他的责任，表面上看来，是完成国家的生产任务，但从本质上看，不妨说，就是做“人”的工作，就是做了解人和关心人的工作。
    现在在工厂里做厂长和党委书记的同志，大多数都是做过农民工作的，不少人真算得是农民群众工作的专家。那个时候，为了要打倒一个地主，我们在农民群众中做了多少细致艰苦的工作呀！农民并不是一个简单的阶级；但是我们不仅知道他们每一种人的特点，而且几乎每一个人在斗争地主这个问题上的一言一行、一忧一喜的真正内容，我们全非常熟悉。这是为什么？就因为同他们真正打成一片了，对他们作过认真的调查研究工作。
    我们从乡村转到城市和工厂已经七年了，对于工厂里的职工群众，我们也像过去对农民那么熟悉么？恐怕只有极少数的厂长或党委书记敢站出来作一个肯定的回答。
    知人善任，知兵善将；做厂长的难道不应该熟悉职工群众么？
    中国的工人阶级是一个天天在发展着的阶级：有新从军队转过来的，有刚放下锄头的，有才拿过斧头、刨子的，有流散在社会上做过其他行道的，有无行道的；更不用说老工人了。这些人的思想意识难道不是各色各样的么？即使在工厂里工作了八年十年，真像一个工人了，他们的生活和思想不仍然像他们的面貌一样在大同之中还有许多小异么？为了组织他们很好进行生产，就必须依靠他们；而要依靠得紧，不就必须首先关心他们，熟悉他们么？
    前些年有人批判过什么“农村工作作风”，但不知怎么，一股风把农村工作中的优良作风也都给刮跑了；关心群众生活这个好传统即是其中的牺牲品之一。是应该重新拾起这些好东西的时候了。也许有人说：工厂太忙，人那么多，像农村中那么做，不行的。这是假话。可以办得到的，上面那个厂长的话就是证据。
