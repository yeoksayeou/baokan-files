　　National Boxing Tournament Finals Held Yesterday
　　Beijing Athletes Win Three Championships
    This newspaper reports that the results of the finals for the 1956 National Boxing, Fencing, and Gymnastics Demonstration Tournament were all revealed last night (the 6th). Beijing athletes won three championships in the five weight classes, while athletes from Fujian Province and Shanghai Municipality each won one championship.

    The bantamweight championship contest between Beijing athlete Wang Shouxin and Shanghai athlete Cai Yongchu was the most exciting match of the night. Wang Shouxin was the 1953 national bantamweight champion, and his movements are exceptionally agile, with both his left and right hands capable of continuous attacks. Cai Yongchu has won the Shanghai bantamweight championship three times; he is tall, has long arms, and his right punch is very strong. In the three-round match, Wang Shouxin used agile dodging and continuous attack tactics to gain the initiative. Because Wang Shouxin was good at both offense and defense, the referees judged him the winner.

    The athletes who won championships in other weight classes were Chen Weiyong from Fujian Province (flyweight), Xu Liansheng from Shanghai Municipality (featherweight), and Chen Xinhua (lightweight) and Wang Guojun (light middleweight) from Beijing.

    After the finals, two exhibition matches were also held.

    In other news, in the men's foil finals held yesterday (the 6th) afternoon, Xi'an athlete Li Zhixiong and Beijing athlete Huang Zhan'ao both had the best record of four wins out of five matches, and their scores were also equal. Therefore, another match had to be held to determine the winner. In this crucial match, Li Zhixiong won the national men's foil championship with a score of five to zero. Huang Zhan'ao took second place, Gao Xiahun (Beijing) took third place, Cheng Yongsheng (Xi'an) took fourth place, and Wang Shougang and Li Junsheng from Beijing took fifth place (their number of wins and scores were equal).

　　北京市运动员夺得三个冠军
    本报讯　1956年全国拳击、击剑、技巧运动表演赛的拳击决赛结果昨天（6日）晚间全部揭晓。北京市运动员在五级决赛中，夺得了三个冠军，福建省和上海市的运动员各获得一个冠军。
    北京市运动员王守忻对上海市运动员蔡永初的最轻级冠军争夺战，是昨晚最精彩的一场比赛。王守忻是1953年最轻级全国冠军，他的动作异常灵活，左右手都能连续攻击。蔡永初曾经三次取得上海市最轻级的冠军，他体高、手长，右手出拳非常硬。王守忻在三局比赛中，利用灵活的闪躲和连续攻击的战术，取得了主动权。因为王守忻能攻善守，被裁判员评为优胜者。
    获得其它各级冠军的运动员是福建省陈伟勇（次最轻级）、上海市许连生（次轻量级）、北京市陈新华（轻量级）和王国钧（轻中级）。
    决赛以后，还举行了两场表演比赛。
    又讯　在昨天（6日）下午举行的男子轻剑决赛中，成绩最好的西安市运动员李志雄和北京市黄占鳌都是五战四胜，得分也相等，因此只好再举行一场比赛以决胜负。李志雄在这场关键性的比赛中，以五比零的战绩荣获男子轻剑的全国冠军，黄占鳌得亚军，第三名是高侠魂（北京），第四名程永盛（西安），第五名是北京市的王守刚和李俊生（他们获胜场数和得分都相等）。
