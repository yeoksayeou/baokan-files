    On “Assistants”
    Ruò Wàng

    Whenever the restructuring of organizations is proposed, and the reduction of some superfluous personnel, some people feel pained: "This is my indispensable assistant, they cannot be transferred." Why can't his assistant be transferred? His reason is even more compelling: "Without an assistant, how am I supposed to work in the future!"

    Alright, then let’s reduce some of the assistants below the assistant. Then the comrades serving as assistants clamor: "They are my assistants! Without them, how can I complete the leader's tasks!"

    Alright, then let's reduce some of the assistants below the assistants of the assistants. Then the assistants of the assistants cry out: "They are our foundation! If they are transferred, it's like undermining the foundation of the wall! How will we contact the various units below in the future!"

    The result is: no change.

    Some leaders don't use their own hands but rely solely on the hands of others, and the assistant still doesn't use their own hands but relies on the hands of even more people. Such is the chain reaction, layer upon layer, which is one of the reasons for bloated personnel and massive organizations.

    Precisely because there are too many "assistants," and assistants below the assistants, it leads to some superiors not needing to contact the various units below. They seem to be looking at the lower realms through a haze, everything is vague and unclear. Whatever the superiors want, the assistant and the assistant's assistant will supply something, which makes these superiors always feel adequate. If these assistants are reduced, he will naturally shout: "How am I supposed to work in the future!" In reality, his "work" can only be a muddled account that he himself doesn't understand.

    Assistants are not absolutely unnecessary, such as retaining necessary deputies, secretaries, clerks, and lean departments. But based on the current situation, greatly reducing some assistants can cure some people's laziness, can make some people's hands move, and can prevent the practice of only presenting typical materials supplied by assistants to "report good things to heaven."

    谈“助手”
    若望
    一提出整编机构，减去一些可有可无的人员，有些人就觉得肉疼了：“这是我必不可少的助手呀，调动不得。”为什么不能调动他的助手呢？他的理由更充分了：“没有助手，今后叫我怎么工作呀！”
    好吧，那么把助手下面的助手减去几个罢，于是担任助手的同志喧嚷着：“他们是我的助手呀，没有他们，叫我怎么完成首长的任务呢！”
    好吧，那么把助手下面的助手的助手们减去几个罢，于是助手的助手们又叫了：“他们是我们的基础呀，把他们调走了，等于挖动了墙根，叫我们今后如何联系下面各个单位呀！”
    结果是：原封不动。
    有些首长不动用自己的手，却专去依赖别人的手，助手仍旧不动用自己的手，却依赖更多的人的手。如此陈陈相因，层层加码，这就是造成人员臃肿，机构庞大的原因之一。
    正因为“助手”太多，而且助手之下又有助手，这就造成了有些在上者可以不去联系下面各个单位，他们仿佛是站在五里雾中看下界，一切都是模模糊糊。上面要什么，助手和助手的助手就供应些什么，这就使得这些在上者永远应付裕如。要是减掉了这些助手，他自然要大喊：“今后叫我怎么工作呀！”其实他的“工作”只能是一篇自己也莫名其妙的糊涂账。
    助手不是绝对不要，比如保留必要的副职、秘书、文书，以及精干的科室之类。但照目前的情况看来，大大地减去一些助手，是可以治治某些人的懒病，可以叫某些人双手活动起来，可以防止那种专门捧着助手们供给的典型材料“上天言好事”的作风。
