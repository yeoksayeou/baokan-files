How Longxi County Became a "Thousand-Jin County" for Rice

Longxi County, Fujian Province, suffered the same level of five major disasters this year as last year: waterlogging, drought, pests, wind, and saline tides. However, the average yield of rice on more than 200,000 mu of land reached 1,081 jin per mu, with a total output increase of more than 60% compared to last year and 35% compared to the highest production level in the past, 1953. Including other grain crops, the average yield per mu in the county reached 1,197 jin. How was this huge victory achieved? When the person in charge of the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party answered this question, he reviewed the process of leading agricultural production over the past year. He emphasized that implementing the mass line and fully utilizing the superiority of advanced cooperatives were the most important experiences for this year's bumper harvest.

Plans Adapt to the Needs of the Masses

Before the spring plowing this year, Longxi County achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization. How to adapt to the highly enthusiastic production of the masses after the high tide of cooperativization and meet the masses' demands for increased production? When the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discussed and formulated the production increase plan, some people believed that the advanced cooperatives had just been established and lacked experience, and that the targets should not be set too high due to continuous disasters. In order to understand the opinions of the peasants, the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to mobilize the masses to discuss and formulate the production increase plan, and directly grasp the typical villages for investigation and research. As a result, in two-thirds of the villages in the county, the peasants proposed to become "thousand-jin villages." Therefore, the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party criticized right-leaning conservative ideas and proposed a plan to strive to realize a "thousand-jin county" for rice. This plan immediately received enthusiastic support from the peasants.

On the fertile fields along the Jiulong River, a huge production upsurge was set off. Advanced cooperatives, with the momentum of thousands of troops, launched assaults on the three fronts of water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and land reclamation, completing many unprecedented feats. The original plan was to build 405 water conservancy projects, but the peasants overcame many unimaginable difficulties and completed 789 projects. These water conservancy projects can benefit 140,000 mu of farmland. The original plan was to apply 13 dan of fertilizer per mu, but the peasants opened up twelve sources of fertilizer, accumulating enough fertilizer to apply 17 dan per mu.

During the early and late rice transplanting seasons, the county suffered more than 90 days of severe drought, affecting 120,000 mu of farmland; in September, there was another flood that inundated more than 50,000 mu of rice fields. However, the collective strength of the advanced cooperatives was great, and the enthusiasm of the members for increasing production was high, and these natural disasters were overcome. During the drought resistance period alone, this county with a population of 260,000 mobilized 136,000 people. Villages and cooperatives supported each other, fighting continuously for dozens of days, bringing dry wells back to life and bringing river water up the mountains. Finally, except for 4,000 mu of drought-affected farmland, all the rest were planted with seedlings.

Leading Production Must Adapt to New Situations

As the production increase movement was in full swing, a series of new problems appeared before the leaders: How to consolidate the peasants' enthusiasm for production? What measures should be taken under the conditions of advanced cooperatives to ensure that the goal of "thousand-jin county" can be achieved? The Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out to all cadres leading production in the county that they should go to the masses to create new leadership methods. The Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party strengthened collective leadership, and the county party secretary grasped key villages, frequently going deep into agricultural cooperatives to investigate and research some important issues, create experience, and guide the work of the entire county. Five county party committee members were sent to the districts, and more than 40 main cadres of the districts were sent to agricultural cooperatives to strengthen leadership, closely contact the masses, and learn from the masses. Therefore, many leadership methods adapted to the new situation were created.

After arranging the whole year's agricultural activities and summarizing the experience of older peasants, the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the idea of grasping the seasons, grasping the key to increased production, and grasping the focus of work in leading agricultural production. In the four stages of preparing for planting, transplanting seedlings, field management, and harvesting, the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that it was necessary to analyze the situation, organize forces, and put forward specific requirements and political slogans to ensure the quality of work, just like in a battle. The county party committee organized inspection groups to check step by step in the four stages, always maintaining the initiative.

A series of technical reforms centered on close planting was an important key to ensuring the realization of the "thousand-jin county" plan. On this issue, a sharp struggle unfolded between advanced experience and conservative thinking. This struggle, relying on the mass line, finally achieved victory. In the past few years, the promotion of close planting of rice had been very slow. After a special investigation, it turned out that the peasants were worried that close planting would require a lot of effort and there would not be enough labor, and they had seen that some agricultural cooperatives had reduced production after implementing close planting in the past due to a lack of coordination with other technical measures, so they doubted that close planting could increase production. In addition to leading the agricultural cooperatives to specifically arrange labor, the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also instructed the agricultural departments to help the peasants truly master various technical measures. The agricultural departments used methods such as running training classes, holding observation meetings, and organizing technical promotion networks to teach the peasants the operating methods of close planting, as well as supporting technical measures such as cultivating strong seedlings, transplanting seedlings early, applying fertilizer rationally, and irrigating rationally, stage by stage according to different seasons. At the time of transplanting, the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party suggested that the agricultural cooperatives establish comparison fields for close planting and sparse planting. As a result, the closely planted rice yielded 30, 50, or even more than 100 jin per mu, actually solving the peasants' ideological problems.

After handing over the methods of increasing production to the peasants, leading the development of labor competitions on the basis of implementing contract labor and production and labor quotas in the agricultural cooperatives consolidated the peasants' enthusiasm for production. Many agricultural cooperatives carried out various labor competitions with different contents within the cooperative throughout the year, most of which were short-term labor competitions with single items. Because the content was simple, the scope was small, and the time was short, it was easy to check and evaluate, and it could be completed from beginning to end, so the labor competition played a great role in completing various production tasks.

Is There Still Potential for Increased Production?

After a year of hard work, the plan for a "thousand-jin county" was realized. Now the peasants throughout the county are universally concerned about whether there is still potential for increased production next year. Regarding this question, the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted investigations in three different types of villages and listened to the opinions of the members in six advanced cooperatives. Then, the Longxi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party calculated several large accounts of potential production increases. At present, 150,000 mu of farmland in the county are still threatened by water and drought disasters. Continuing to build water conservancy projects next year and expanding and improving the irrigation area by 80,000 to 90,000 mu can increase grain production by several million jin. Mobilizing peasants to raise more pigs and cattle to accumulate fertilizer, expanding the planting of green manure crops, and self-making granular fertilizer can achieve two more dan of fertilizer per mu. More than 10,000 mu of single-season rice fields in the county have the conditions to be converted to double-season rice, and several thousand mu of mountain fields need to be improved. This year, many agricultural cooperatives have not coordinated the various technical measures very well. These potentials for increasing production are reliable, and it is estimated that the total annual increase in production can be more than ten million jin of grain.

In the first half of this year, due to the one-sidedness of leadership thinking, the leadership of economic crops and sideline production was once abandoned. Later, this mistake was corrected, and the policy of comprehensively developing production was implemented. Next year, the production in this area of the agricultural cooperatives will be further developed, and income will be greatly increased.

In the rural areas of Longxi County, while people are calculating the potential for increased production and discussing and formulating plans for comprehensive development of production next year, they also see the further consolidation of agricultural cooperatives brought about by the bumper harvest, the increase in public accumulation in the cooperative, and the richer experience of cadres in leading production. Now the peasants and cadres throughout the county have great enthusiasm for striving for further production increases next year.

    龙溪县怎样成为水稻“千斤县”
    新华社记者　谢丁
    福建省龙溪县今年遭到和去年同样程度的水、旱、虫、风、碱潮五大灾害，可是二十多万亩水稻每亩平均产量达到一千零八十一斤，总产量比去年增加60％以上，比过去最高生产水平1953年增加35％。加上其他粮食作物，全县每亩平均产量达到一千一百九十七斤。这个巨大的胜利是怎样得来的呢？中共龙溪县委员会负责人回答这个问题的时候，回顾了一年来领导农业生产的过程。他强调指出，贯彻群众路线，充分发挥高级社的优越性，是今年粮食丰收最主要的经验。
    计划适应群众的要求
    今年春耕之前，龙溪县实现了农业高级合作化。怎样适应群众在合作化高潮以后十分高涨的生产热情，满足群众增加生产的要求呢？中共龙溪县委员会讨论制定增产计划的时候，曾经有人认为，高级社刚办起来，经验不足，而且连年有灾情，指标不能订得太高。为了了解农民的意见，中共龙溪县委员会决定发动群众讨论制定增产计划，并且直接掌握典型乡作调查研究。结果，全县有三分之二的乡，农民提出要成为“千斤乡”。于是，中共龙溪县委员会批判了右倾保守思想，提出了争取实现水稻“千斤县”的计划。这个计划立刻得到农民的热烈拥护。
    在九龙江畔的沃野上，巨大的生产高潮掀起来了。高级社以千军万马的声势，向兴修水利、积肥和开荒三条战线突击，完成了许多史无前例的壮举。原计划修四百零五处水利工程，结果农民克服许多难以想像的困难，完成了七百八十九处。这些水利工程可以使十四万亩田地受益。原计划每亩施肥十三担，结果农民开辟十二种肥源，积下了足够每亩施用十七担的肥料。
    早、晚两季水稻插秧的时候，前后遭到九十多天大旱，受旱农田有十二万亩；9月又发生洪水，淹没了五万多亩稻田。但是，高级社集体力量大，社员增产积极性高，这些自然灾害都被战胜了。单是在抗旱期间，这个二十六万人口的县份出动了十三万六千人。各乡各社互相支援，连续战斗几十天，使枯井复活，使河水上山。最后，受旱的农田除了四千亩以外，其余全部插上秧苗。
    领导生产要适应新情况
    增产运动闹得热火朝天，在领导者面前出现了一连串新问题：怎样巩固农民的生产热情？在高级社的条件下采取什么措施保证“千斤县”的目标能够实现？中共龙溪县委员会向全县领导生产的干部指出，到群众中去创造新的领导方法。中共龙溪县委员会加强了集体领导，并且由县委书记掌握重点乡，经常深入到农业社调查研究一些重要问题，创造经验，指导全县工作。有五个县委委员被派到区里，四十多个区的主要干部被派到农业社里，以加强领导，密切联系群众和向群众学习。因此，许多适应新情况的领导方法被创造出来了。
    把全年农事活动排队，总结老年农民的经验以后，中共龙溪县委员会提出了在领导农业生产中抓季节、抓增产关键、抓工作重点的思想。在备耕、插秧、田间管理和收获的四个阶段，中共龙溪县委员会认为要像作战一样分析情况，组织力量，提出具体的要求和政治口号，保证工作质量。县委组织起检查团，在四个阶段中做一步查一步，一直掌握了主动。
    以密植为中心的一系列技术改革，是保证“千斤县”计划实现的重要增产关键。在这个问题上，先进经验和保守思想展开了一场尖锐的斗争。这场斗争依靠走群众路线，终于取得了胜利。过去几年，水稻密植推广得很慢。经过专门调查，原来是农民顾虑密植花工夫大，劳动力不够安排，加上看到有些农业社过去在实行密植以后缺乏其他技术措施的配合而减了产，便怀疑密植不能增产。中共龙溪县委员会除领导各农业社具体安排了劳动力外，还指示农业部门帮助农民切实掌握各项技术措施。农业部门以开办训练班、举行观摩会、组织技术推广网等方式，根据不同季节逐段向农民传授了密植的操作方法，以及培育壮秧、提早插秧、合理施肥、合理灌溉等配合的技术措施。在插秧的时候，中共龙溪县委员会建议农业社建立密植和稀植的比较田。结果，密植的水稻每亩都增产三、五十斤甚至一百多斤，实际解决了农民的思想问题。
    把增产办法交给农民以后，在农业社实行包工包产和劳动定额的基础上领导开展劳动竞赛，巩固了农民的生产热情。许多农业社全年都开展社内的各种不同内容的劳动竞赛，大多数是单项内容的短期劳动竞赛。因为内容单纯，范围小，时间短，便于检查评比，能够有始有终，所以劳动竞赛对于完成各项生产任务的作用很大。
    还有增产潜力吗？
    经过一年艰苦劳动，实现了“千斤县”的计划。现在全县农民普遍关心的是：明年还有增产潜力吗？对于这个问题，中共龙溪县委员会在三个不同类型的乡做了调查，并且在六个高级社中听取了社员的意见。然后，中共龙溪县委员会算了几笔大的增产潜力账。目前全县有十五万亩田地还受水、旱灾害威胁。明年继续兴修水利工程，扩大和改善灌溉面积八、九万亩，就可以增产几百万斤粮食。发动农民增养猪、牛积肥，扩种绿肥作物，自制颗粒肥料，可以做到每亩多施两担肥。全县有一万多亩单季稻田有条件改种双季稻，有几千亩山田需要改良土壤。今年不少农业社还没有把各项技术措施配合得很好。这几项增产潜力是可靠的，算下来全年可以增产一千几百万斤粮食。
    今年上半年由于领导思想的片面性，一度放弃了对经济作物、副业生产的领导。后来这一错误已经被纠正，全面发展生产的方针得到了贯彻。明年各农业社在这方面的生产将进一步发展，收入将大大增加。
    在龙溪县农村中，人们正在计算增产潜力账，讨论制定明年全面发展生产的计划的时候，还看到丰收带来的农业社的进一步巩固，社里公共积累的增加，干部们领导生产的经验更加丰富了。现在全县农民和干部争取明年进一步增产的劲头很大。
