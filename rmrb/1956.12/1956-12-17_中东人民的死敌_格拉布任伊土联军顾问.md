Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 13th (TASS): According to a report from the Middle East News Agency correspondent in Ankara: It is known that former commander of the Arab Legion, British General Glubb, has been appointed as an advisor to the Iraqi-Turkish Joint Command.

According to newspaper reports, this appointment has deeply angered political figures in Arab countries.

"Al-Gomhouria" wrote that General Glubb is known for participating in conspiracies against the independence of Arab countries, and the task entrusted to him is to sow seeds of discord among Arab countries.

(Editor's note) Glubb is a sworn enemy of the Middle East national liberation movement. As early as 1920, he participated in the suppression of the Iraqi independence movement. After becoming the commander-in-chief of the Jordanian "Arab Legion" in 1930, he became the de facto ruler of Jordan under British rule, known as the "Emperor of Jordan." He tried every possible means to drag Jordan into the Baghdad Pact and ordered the "Arab Legion" troops to carry out bloody massacres against demonstrators opposing the Baghdad Pact. However, the Jordanian people's struggle for independence has been on the rise, and the King of Jordan ordered the dismissal of Glubb from his position as commander-in-chief of the "Arab Legion" in March of this year, expelling him from Jordan.

    中东人民的死敌
    格拉布任伊土联军顾问
    新华社讯　塔斯社开罗13日讯：据中东通讯社记者自安卡拉报道：据悉，前阿拉伯军团司令、英国将军格拉布被任命为伊拉克—土耳其联合司令部顾问。
    据报纸报道，这项任命使阿拉伯国家政界人士深为愤怒。
      “共和国报”写道，格拉布将军是以参加反对阿拉伯国家的独立的阴谋活动出名的，他被委托的任务是在阿拉伯国家之间散布不和的种子。
    （编者注）格拉布是中东民族解放运动的死敌。他早在1920年就参加过镇压伊拉克的独立运动。1930年任约旦“阿拉伯军团”总司令后，成了英国统治约旦的太上皇，有“约旦皇帝”之称。他曾千方百计地想把约旦拖进巴格达条约，命令“阿拉伯军团”部队向反对巴格达条约的示威群众实行过血腥的屠杀。但是，约旦人民争取独立的斗争日益高涨，约旦国王在今年3月下令解除了格拉布的“阿拉伯军团”总司令的职务，把他撵出了约旦。
