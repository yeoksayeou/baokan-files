    A Pointless Argument

    The office of a certain infrastructure construction unit.

    Dirt Excavator: "Comrade Planner! The plan you made is not right. The planned earthwork volume differs too much from the actual amount!"

    Planner: "It can't be wrong! I calculated it according to the construction drawings several times."

    Dirt Excavator: "I'm talking about the actual amount."

    Planner: "Don't make trouble. You find someone who understands to look at the drawings submitted by the design department. If it's calculated wrong, I'll take responsibility."

    Dirt Excavator: "Ah?..."

    Who Decides?

    The head of the technical supervision section and the workshop director of a certain factory had an argument.

    Section Chief: "If you insist on your approach, all products will be treated as substandard products."

    Director: "Our approach will definitely not affect quality. Even the dispatch chief has agreed to it."

    Dispatch Chief: "Quality will not be affected. No problem, I agree!"

    Section Chief: "Who decides?"

    Quality Standard: "I decide! But you don't let me speak up."

    找不到焦点的争论
    某基建单位办公室。
    挖土工人：“计划员同志！你作的计划不对头。计划的土方数跟实际相差太远啦！”
    计划员：“不会错！我按施工图纸计算了足有几遍。”
    挖土工人：“我说的是实际。”
    计划员：“别搅了。你找个明白人去看看设计交来的图纸，算错了，我负责任。”
    挖土工人：“啊？……”
    谁说了算
    某厂技术监督科长和车间主任发生了争吵。
    科长：“如果坚持你们的作法，全部产品都按不合格品处理。”
    主任：“我们的作法，决不影响质量。连调度长都同意了的。”
    调度长：“质量不会受影响。没问题，我同意！”
    科长：“谁说了算？”
    质量标准：“我说了算！但是你们不叫我出头。”
