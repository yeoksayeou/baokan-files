Correctly Resolve the Issue of a Few Handicraft Cooperative Members Withdrawing
Commentator of this newspaper

Since August, the phenomenon of a few handicraft production cooperative members withdrawing from the cooperative has successively occurred in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Among those who withdrew, the vast majority were newly joined independent laborers, small business owners, and technically skilled members. After withdrawing, most returned home to work as individual business owners, some went to work in state-owned or joint state-private enterprises, and some engaged in street repairs or other temporary work. In addition, some members are still waiting and seeing, considering whether it is better to stay in the cooperative or withdraw. Some have already been doing outside work on holidays, and some are producing in the cooperative during the day and taking on business at home in the evening. Although the number of people withdrawing is not large at present, if this issue is not handled well or in a timely manner, it will hinder the socialist transformation of handicrafts. Therefore, it is hoped that handicraft cooperative organizations at all levels will attach importance to and resolve this issue.

There are objective reasons for members requesting withdrawal. That is: the living standards of urban and rural people have improved, and it is currently the peak season for the market, with some commodities in short supply. After the opening of the free market, some commodity purchasing departments sought sources of goods from individual handicraft workers, making the business of individual handicraft workers suddenly prosperous, which gave the cooperative members a great stimulus. However, the main reason why many members requested withdrawal was that their income decreased after joining the cooperative. Why did income decrease? This is the result of some cooperative organizations not earnestly implementing the Party and government's policies on the socialist transformation of handicrafts. In order to develop production and ensure increased income for members, the Party and government have made many instructions, for example, regarding the issue of cooperative income distribution, it is stipulated that the principle of "first wages, then medical treatment and relief, and only then accumulation if there is a surplus" must be followed. That is to say: when distributing cooperative income, it is necessary to first ensure increased income for members, second, to run some urgently needed welfare undertakings, and finally, if there is a large surplus, accumulate more, and if there is a small surplus, accumulate less. However, some handicraft cooperative organizations have reversed this principle: accumulating first, then wages and welfare. Moreover, some handicraft cooperatives are subjectively eager to implement mechanized production, setting the accumulation amount too high, so that the income of the members not only did not increase, but decreased, which caused dissatisfaction among the members.

On the issue of deciding whether cooperatives should operate in a decentralized or centralized manner, the Party and government have instructed that it must be based on the characteristics of production and specific conditions, such as the number and quality of cadres, the size of the workshop, etc. Wherever centralization is more conducive to production and convenient for service, it should be centralized; where decentralization is more convenient for production and service, it should be decentralized. However, some cooperative organizations believe that the larger the cooperative, the better, and the more centralized, the better, regardless of the characteristics of production and specific conditions, concentrating things that should not be concentrated, and even concentrating them to a high degree. As a result, the enthusiasm of the members cannot be brought into play, business cannot be developed, and great inconvenience is caused to the lives of the masses. At the same time, after centralization, either production suffers losses due to weak leadership and chaotic management, or expenses are too high due to bloated management institutions, which has a great impact on the income of the members. Some handicraft production has great seasonality, with short operating hours in the off-season and long operating hours in the peak season. Some cooperative organizations disregard this characteristic and blindly "industrialize," fixing the working hours of the off-season and peak season at eight and a half or nine hours. As a result, when the peak season arrives, on the one hand, there is a shortage of market supply, and on the other hand, the members are idle at night and their income decreases. Therefore, some technically skilled members, in order to increase their income, request to withdraw from the cooperative, or work in the cooperative during the day and do outside work at home in the evening.

Regarding small business owners who join the cooperative, the Party and government have also instructed that they should be used according to their talents, and their auxiliary labor force should also be given appropriate arrangements in order to ensure their income. However, many cooperative organizations have not arranged small business owners according to their talents, or have set wages too low, and have not properly arranged their auxiliary labor force, resulting in a decrease in their income.

Some comrades believe that the superiority of handicraft cooperation is not reflected in more products, better quality, lower costs, and increased income for members, but in mechanized and industrialized production. In order to pursue mechanization and industrialization, they disregard the policies of the Party and government, set the public accumulation fund as high as possible, and try to be like modern factories in everything. This is a manifestation of subjectivism in the socialist transformation of handicrafts. Therefore, to consolidate and develop handicraft cooperatives, it is necessary to overcome this subjectivist thinking. According to the policies of the Party and government, it is very necessary to conduct a comprehensive review of the work. If it is found in the inspection that the accumulation ratio is too high, it should be appropriately lowered; if it has been concentrated when it should not have been, it should be separated quickly; if the arrangement of small business owners and auxiliary labor force is unreasonable, it should be adjusted; if the wages are unreasonable, they should be appropriately adjusted; the large management institutions should be streamlined; other unreasonable business management systems should also be changed according to the characteristics of handicraft production. This is a very arduous and meticulous task. As long as this work is done well, the production enthusiasm of all members can be brought into play. For example, after the Tianjin No. 39 Sewing Cooperative changed from centralized production to decentralized production, it restored the flexible business characteristics, and business was overwhelming. The turnover in August increased by 117% compared with centralized production, and the income of the members increased by more than doubled. Unfortunately, some handicraft cooperative organizations now do not admit that there are shortcomings in the reorganization and transformation work, and simply attribute the reasons for members' withdrawal to "lack of ideological education" and "the temptation of the free market," and therefore simply use the method of labeling them with big hats such as "serious capitalist thinking" and "resisting transformation" to prevent members from withdrawing. This is very wrong and should be corrected. Some commodity purchasing units suppress grades and prices when purchasing cooperative products, but rush to purchase from individual handicraft workers at high prices; some banks blindly provide loans to handicraft owners who employ more than a dozen workers; some tax bureaus adopt a low fixed tax method for individual handicraft workers, making the tax rate much lower than that of cooperatives. These practices are also incorrect and should be corrected.

    正确解决少数手工业合作社社员退社问题
    本报评论员
    8月份以来，北京、天津、上海等地陆续发生少数手工业生产合作社社员退社的现象。在退社的人中，绝大多数是新入社的独立劳动者、小业主和技术较好的社员。他们退社以后，大部分是回家当业主单干，部分则到国营或公私合营企业去工作，部分则串街做修理或其它临时活。另外有些社员还在观望，考虑是留在社内好呢，还是退社好。有的人则已经利用假日做外活，有的白天在社里生产，晚上回家承接业务。现在退社的人虽然不多，但如果对这个问题处理得不好或不及时，那末，就要妨碍手工业的社会主义改造。所以，希望各级手工业合作组织重视和解决这个问题。
    社员要求退社，是有其客观原因的。那就是：城乡人民生活水平提高了，目前又是市场旺季，有些商品供应紧张。自由市场开放以后，有些商品采购部门向个体手工业者找货源，使个体手工业者营业突然兴旺起来，这给合作社社员很大的刺激。然而不少社员要求退社的主要原因，则是这些人参加合作社以后收入减少了。收入为什么减少了呢？这是有些合作组织没有认真执行党和政府关于手工业的社会主义改造政策的结果。为了发展生产和保证社员增加收入，党和政府曾经作过许多指示，例如对合作社收益分配的问题，就规定了必须本着“先工资、后治病救济，有剩余才积累”的原则。也就是说：在分配合作社收益的时候，必须首先保证社员增加收入，其次要举办一些急需的福利事业，最后剩余多的，积累就多一些，剩余少的就积累少一些。可是，有些手工业合作组织却把这个原则颠倒过来：先积累，后工资和福利。而且有些手工业合作社又主观地急于实行机械化生产，把积累额定得过高，致使社员的收入不仅没有增加，反而降低了，因而就引起社员的不满。
    在决定合作社分散或集中经营的问题上，党和政府曾指示：必须根据生产的特点，根据具体条件，如干部数量、质量、工场大小等等，凡是集中比较有利于生产和便于服务的，就集中；分散比较便于生产和服务的，就分散。但是，有些合作组织则以为合作社越大越好，越集中越好，不顾生产特点和具体条件，把不该集中的也集中起来了，甚至高度地集中起来。结果社员的积极性不能发挥，业务不能开展，而且给群众生活上造成很大的不方便。同时，集中起来以后，不是因为领导薄弱，管理混乱而使生产受到损失，便是因为管理机构臃肿而使开支过大，这对社员的收入都有很大的影响。有些手工业生产有很大的季节性，淡季的作业时间短，旺季的作业时间长。有些合作组织则无视这个特点，盲目地“工厂化”，把淡季和旺季的工时固定为八小时半或九小时。于是，旺季到来以后，便一方面出现了市场供应紧张，另一方面社员晚上闲着，收入减少。因此，有些技术较好的社员，为了增加收入，便要求退社，或者白天在社里干活，晚上回家做外活。
    对于加入合作社的小业主，党和政府也曾指示要量才使用，对他们的辅助劳动力，也要给以适当安排，以便保证他们的收入。但是，不少合作组织对小业主都没有量才安排，或者把工资订得偏低，而且又没有妥善地安排他们的辅助劳动力，致使他们的收入减少。
    有些同志认为：手工业合作化的优越性，不是表现在产品多，质量好，成本低，社员收入增加上面，而是表现在机械化、工厂化的生产上面。为了追求机械化工厂化，他们便不顾党和政府的政策，把公积金订得尽量高，处处想向现代化工厂看齐。这是主观主义思想在手工业社会主义改造工作中的一种表现。所以，要巩固和发展手工业合作社，就必须克服这种主观主义思想。根据党和政府的政策，全面地检查一次工作是很必要的。在检查中发现积累比例偏高的，要适当降低；不该集中而又已集中起来的，要迅速分开；对小业主和辅助劳动力安排得不合理的，要加以调整；工资不合理的，应当适当调整；管理机构庞大的要精简；对其它不合理的经营管理制度，也要按照手工业生产的特点加以改变。这是很艰巨的细致的工作。只要做好这些工作，就能发挥全体社员的生产积极性。例如天津市第三十九缝纫社变集中生产为分散生产后，恢复了机动灵活的经营特点，业务应接不暇，8月份的营业额就比集中生产时增加了117％，社员收入增加了一倍多。可惜，现在有些手工业合作组织不承认改组改造工作有缺点，把社员退社的原因单纯说成“缺乏思想教育”和“自由市场的诱惑”，因而简单地以扣“资本主义思想严重”、“抗拒改造”等大帽子的办法，来阻止社员退社。这是十分错误的，应该加以纠正。有些商品采购单位，在收购合作社产品的时候，压级压价，但却以高价向个体手工业者抢购；有的银行对那些雇用十几个工人的手工业主，也盲目地给以贷款；有的税务局对个体手工业者，一律采取低额定税的办法，使税率比合作社的低得很多。这些做法，也是不对的，也要纠正。
