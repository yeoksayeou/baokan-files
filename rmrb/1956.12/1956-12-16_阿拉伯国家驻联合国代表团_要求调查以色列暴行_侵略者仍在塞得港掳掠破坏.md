Xinhua News Agency, 15th: New York Dispatch: The delegations of eleven Arab nations to the United Nations on the 14th requested UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to investigate the Israeli atrocities in the massacre of Arab refugees and the destruction carried out by the Israeli army when withdrawing from the Sinai Peninsula.

The eleven countries are Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen.

The head of the Iraqi delegation, Mohammed Fadil al-Jamali, representing the eleven countries at a press conference, accused Israel of using a "Hitler-style scorched earth policy" in the Sinai Peninsula. He said that roads, railways, telephone and telegraph lines, bridges, water reservoirs, wells and villages are being subjected to "complete destruction," "which is a clear violation of the UN General Assembly's ceasefire order and implies a continuation of aggression."

Jamali mentioned that Israeli border police killed forty-eight Arab citizens of Israel in the village of Kafr Qasim near the Jordanian border on October 29. He said: "Israel admits to the massacre of forty-eight people, but it is believed that the number of people killed is much higher than that figure. They are asking the Secretary-General to conduct a full investigation and submit a report."

Jamali also called on the United Nations to pay attention to Israel's unwillingness to withdraw quickly and completely from Egyptian territory.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: According to TASS, Cairo, 13th: Egyptian newspapers reported that Anglo-French aggressors are still persecuting Egyptian residents in the Port Said area and carrying out destruction and looting in the city.

The aggressors' armed forces conducted searches in the Arab quarters of the city, arresting large numbers of people, especially young people. Under the pretext of searching for hidden weapons, the aggressors destroyed the homes of peaceful residents and looted their property.

According to "Al-Ahram", the French aggressors destroyed workshops and buildings belonging to the Suez Canal Authority in Port Fouad, stealing many valuable pieces of equipment from there. The aggressors set fire to many warehouses of the Authority, causing enormous material losses to these warehouses. "Al-Ahram" reported that on December 12, the bodies of three French soldiers were found on "Nahda" Street, who had been executed by participants in the people's resistance movement for the crimes of these French soldiers. The resistance activities of the Egyptian residents struck a blow to the arrogance of the aggressors, and the occupying authorities forbade soldiers from moving alone in the streets. Slogans posted by Egyptian patriots were everywhere, and leaflets demanding the punishment of war criminals were distributed in the city.

    阿拉伯国家驻联合国代表团
    要求调查以色列暴行
    侵略者仍在塞得港掳掠破坏
    新华社15日讯　纽约消息：驻联合国的十一个阿拉伯国家代表团14日要求联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德调查以色列屠杀阿拉伯难民的暴行和以色列军队从西奈半岛撤退的时候所进行的破坏。
    这十一个国家是埃及、伊拉克、约旦、黎巴嫩、利比亚、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、叙利亚、突尼斯和也门。
    伊拉克代表团团长穆罕默德·法迪尔·贾马利在一个记者招待会上代表十一个国家指责以色列在西奈半岛上“使用了希特勒式的焦土政策”。他说，公路、铁路、电话电报线、桥梁、储水池、井和村庄正遭到“彻底的破坏”，“这显然是违反联合国大会的停火命令，并且意味着继续进行侵略。”
    贾马利提到以色列的边界警察10月29日在约旦边界附近的卡夫尔卡塞姆村杀害了四十八个以色列籍阿拉伯人。他说：“以色列承认屠杀了四十八人，可是据信被杀的人数要比这个数字多得多。他们要求秘书长进行一次充分的调查和提出报告。”
    贾马利还要求联合国注意以色列不想迅速而彻底地撤出埃及领土。
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社开罗13日讯：埃及报纸报道，英法侵略者仍然在塞得港地区迫害埃及居民并且在市内进行破坏和劫掠。
    侵略者的武装部队在市内的阿拉伯街区进行了搜查，逮捕了大批的人，特别是青年人。侵略者以搜查隐藏的武器为借口，破坏了和平居民的房屋，劫掠了他们的财产。
    据“金字塔报”报道，法国侵略者在福得港破坏了属于苏伊士运河管理局的工场和建筑物，从那里偷去许多贵重的设备。侵略者纵火烧毁了这个管理局的许多仓库，使这些仓库受到了巨大的物质损失。“金字塔报”报道，12月12日在“纳赫达”街上发现三个法国侵略军的尸体，这是被人民抵抗运动的参加者根据这些法国士兵的罪行而处死的。埃及居民的抵抗活动打击了侵略者的气焰，侵略军当局禁止士兵单独在街上行动。到处都有埃及爱国者张贴的标语，城里散发了要求惩办战争罪犯的传单。
