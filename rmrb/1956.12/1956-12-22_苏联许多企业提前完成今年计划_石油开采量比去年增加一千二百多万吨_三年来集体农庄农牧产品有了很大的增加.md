This newspaper dispatches from Moscow on December 21st: Throughout the Soviet Union, hundreds upon hundreds of industrial enterprises are reporting the good news of completing the first year's production tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This is the result of the Soviet working class's diligent and active labor throughout the year.

The laborers of Leningrad City and Oblast completed the state plan for this year ahead of schedule on the 17th in terms of total output and major varieties. Labor productivity increased by 2.7%, and product costs were reduced, saving nearly 380 million rubles. Workers and scientific workers are cooperating closely in adopting advanced technologies. The employees of the Nevsky Machine-Building Plant produced many new types of machines, including an 18,000 kW turbine, which is half the weight of the previously produced 14,000 kW turbine. The employees of the Svetlana Factory mastered the technology of electronics and semiconductors and produced sixteen new types of instruments.

The meat and dairy industry of the Russian Republic completed the annual plan half a month ahead of schedule, with meat and dairy products increasing by 20% compared to last year.

The Solikamsk Paper Mill in Molotov Oblast completed the annual plan more than half a month ahead of schedule, preparing to overproduce 5,400 tons of paper before the New Year.

The "Coal Cutting" Trust in Karaganda completed the annual plan ahead of schedule, and by the 15th, had shipped 320 extra trainloads of coal.

In Baku, the oil drilling team led by Shafakuri Yev completed the annual plan ahead of schedule. From the beginning of the year to mid-December, they drilled fifteen oil wells in various locations on the Absheron Peninsula. Drilling reached approximately 26,000 meters, setting a new all-Soviet record.

Xinhua News Agency reports from Moscow via TASS: By mid-December, Soviet oil extraction had increased by 12.5 million tons compared to last year. This amount is equal to one to nine times the average annual increase in oil production during the previous five-year plans.

In recent years, surveyors have discovered eighty-nine new oil-producing areas and forty gas-producing areas. The center of gravity of oil extraction is constantly shifting to the eastern part of the Soviet Union, closer to the oil-consuming regions. This is of great significance to the Soviet economy and national defense. The oil extraction volume of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic this year has greatly exceeded the level of Baku, a world-renowned oil-producing area. Currently, the extraction volume of the Ural-Volga oil region, known as "Second Baku," accounts for 58.3% of the Soviet Union's total liquid fuel extraction.

Xinhua News Agency reports from Moscow: According to a report in the Soviet "Agricultural Newspaper," the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a communique stating that since the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the production of agricultural and livestock products on Soviet collective farms has increased significantly. In the past three years, the national collective farms' grain output has increased by nearly 40%, flax fiber has increased to 2.7 times, sugar beets and sunflowers have increased to 1.4 times, potatoes have increased to 1.7 times, vegetables have increased to 1.8 times, raw cotton has increased by nearly 14%, milk production has nearly doubled, and the production of meat, wool, and eggs has also increased.

This year is the year with the fastest development of production on Soviet collective farms in the past three years, and they have supplied the state with much more agricultural and livestock products than in the past. By October 10th, the national collective farms had delivered 473 million poods (one pood equals 32.76 catties) more grain to the state than last year. By November 20th, they had delivered 568,000 tons more raw cotton, 2.4 million tons more sugar beets, 1.1 million tons more potatoes, and 163,000 tons more vegetables to the state than in the same period last year. The annual plan for delivering high-grade tea to the state has also been completed. The number of livestock and the productivity of livestock products on collective farms have increased. In the first ten months of this year alone, they delivered and sold 2.1 million tons more milk to the state than in the same period last year.

    苏联许多企业提前完成今年计划
    石油开采量比去年增加一千二百多万吨
    三年来集体农庄农牧产品有了很大的增加
    本报莫斯科21日电　苏联各地成千成百的工业企业纷纷传出提前完成第六个五年计划第一年生产任务的捷报。这是苏联工人阶级一年来辛勤的积极的劳动结果。
    列宁格勒市和州的劳动者17日在总产量和主要品种方面提前完成了今年国家计划。劳动生产率提高了2.7％，并且降低了产品成本，节约了近三亿八千万卢布。工人们和科学工作者在采用先进技术方面进行紧密的合作。涅瓦机器制造厂的职工生产了许多新式机器，包括一万八千瓩的涡轮机，它的重量比以前出产的一万四千瓩的涡轮机还轻一半。斯维特兰工厂的职工掌握了电子和半导体的技术，生产了十六种新式仪器。
    俄罗斯共和国的肉类和乳品工业提前半月完成了年度计划，肉乳制品比去年增加了20％。
    莫洛托夫州索里卡马造纸厂提前半个多月完成了年度计划，准备到新年前超额增产五千四百吨纸。
    卡拉干达的“截煤”托辣斯提前完成年度计划，在15日超额输出了三百二十列车煤。
    在巴库，由沙法库里也夫领导的石油钻井组提前完成了年度计划，从年初到12月中旬在阿普歇伦半岛各处钻好了十五口油井。钻进约二万六千公尺，创造了全苏最高纪录。
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：到12月中旬，苏联石油开采量已经比去年增加了一千二百五十万吨。这个数目等于前几个五年计划中每年石油的平均增产量的一倍到九倍。
    最近几年来勘测人员发现了八十九处新的石油产地和四十个煤气产地。石油开采的重心正在不断向靠近石油消费地区的苏联东部移动。这对苏联经济上和国防上都有重大的意义。鞑靼自治共和国今年的石油开采量已经大大超过了世界知名的石油产地巴库的水平。目前，号称“第二巴库”的乌拉尔和伏尔加河之间的石油区的开采量，已经占苏联液体燃料全部开采量的58.3％。
    据新华社莫斯科电　据苏联“农业报”报道：苏联农业部最近发表公报说，从1953年苏共中央9月全体会议以后到现在，苏联集体农庄的农产品和畜产品的生产已经大大增加。三年来，全国集体农庄的谷物产量差不多增加了40％，亚麻纤维增加到二点七倍，甜菜和向日葵增加到一点四倍，马铃薯增加到一点七倍，蔬菜增加到一点八倍，原棉将近增加了14％，牛奶产量将近增加到两倍，肉、羊毛和蛋的产量也增加了。
    今年是三年来苏联集体农庄生产发展最快的一年，它们为国家供应的农畜产品比过去多得多。到10月10日，全国集体农庄交售给国家的谷物已经比去年增加了四亿七千三百万普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）。到11月20日，它们交售给国家的原棉比去年同期增加了五十六万八千吨，甜菜多二百四十万吨，马铃薯多一百一十万吨，蔬菜多十六万三千吨。向国家交售高级茶叶的全年计划也完成了。集体农庄的牲畜头数和牲畜的产品生产率都增加了。在今年头十个月内，它们单是交售和出售给国家的牛奶就比去年同时期增加了二百一十万吨。
