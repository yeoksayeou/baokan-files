Editor's Notes

    Between Neighbors
    Our country is a lovely big family.

    Hebei Province suffered severe flooding this year. Many regions across the country have provided a lot of assistance to the people of Hebei Province. As a neighboring province of Hebei, the people of Shanxi Province, due to geographical proximity and a historical tradition of mutual assistance in times of difficulty, have shown great concern for the difficulties of their neighboring compatriots. Whether it's material assistance or spiritual comfort, it's a great encouragement to the people in the disaster areas of Hebei who are struggling for production and to overcome the famine.

      "Dig a canal to one's own field and dump the surplus water into the neighbor's," is an inevitable phenomenon in a society dominated by the exploiting classes. In a society where the working people are the masters of their own house, being friendly to neighbors has become a public virtue.

    Capitalism will turn brothers into enemies for the sake of private interests; socialism will turn people from all over the world into close brothers for the sake of common interests.

    Our country's socialist construction is developing rapidly, and the economic and cultural ties between provinces (regions) across the country are becoming closer and closer, and the exchanges between the people of each province (region) are becoming more and more frequent. This situation requires all provinces (regions) to frequently and proactively cooperate with each other in various tasks, help each other, and work closely together. In this regard, have the agencies, organizations, and enterprises in all regions of the country done their best? It would be beneficial to examine this situation.

    邻居之间
    我们的国家是一个可爱的大家庭。
    河北省今年遭受了严重的水灾，全国许多地区都对河北省人民给予了很多援助，作为河北省的邻省的山西省人民，由于地域上的接近和患难相助的历史传统，对于邻省同胞的困难，更表现了极大的关怀。不论是物质上的援助或是精神上的慰问，对于正在为生产渡荒而斗争的河北灾区人民，都是很大的鼓舞力量。
      “以邻为壑”，是剥削阶级占统治地位的社会里的必然现象。在劳动人民当家做主的社会里，以邻为友成了一种公德。
    资本主义会使弟兄为争夺私利变成仇敌；社会主义会使天南地北的人们为了公共的利益变成亲弟兄。
    我国的社会主义建设正在迅速地向前发展，全国各个省（区）之间在经济上、文化上的联系越来越密切，各省（区）人民之间的交往也越来越频繁。这种情况要求各省（区）在各项工作上经常地、主动地互相配合，互相帮助，密切合作。在这方面，全国各个地区的机关、团体、企业是不是都做得尽善尽美了呢？把这方面的情况检查一下，将会是一件有益的事。
