Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 24th. The state-owned Taiyuan Cement Plant, at a recent plenary session of the Workers' Congress, discussed and revised the 1957 plan. Nineteen suggestions made by the workers have been formally incorporated into the plan.

This is the ninth Workers' Congress held by the Taiyuan Cement Plant this year. All major technical, management, and labor protection measures are discussed and implemented at the Workers' Congress at every stage. This spring, when discussing how to guarantee the completion of the annual plan, workers suggested changing the temporary repair method of the cement mill to a major overhaul, which enabled the factory to produce more than 2,000 tons of cement this year.

In July, when all the employees were studying the early completion of the Five-Year Plan, the personnel of the electromechanical section proposed adding a coarse crushing mill. With the support of the factory leaders, the technicians designed and used the factory's old and waste materials to make this mill, which increased the annual output of cement by 30,000 tons.

During this year's wage reform, the factory leaders submitted the evaluation plan to the Workers' Congress for repeated discussions and revisions. The workers reflected that this wage evaluation work was the best one ever done.

The system of Workers' Congresses at the Taiyuan Cement Plant was established in 1950. After 1953, it once became a mere formality, but it has gradually improved since then. This year, many difficult tasks in the factory have been successfully resolved by relying on the Workers' Congress, so the factory leaders have become more aware of the importance of the Workers' Congress.

    太原水泥厂坚持职工代表大会制度
    许多重大问题都解决得很好
    据新华社太原24日电　国营太原水泥厂在最近召开的一次全厂职工代表大会上，讨论和修订了1 957年的计划方案。职工们提出的意见，有十九项被正式纳入计划方案。
    这已经是太原水泥厂今年的第九次职工代表大会了。这个厂里每个时期重大的技术、管理和劳保措施都要在职工代表大会上讨论贯彻。今年春天在讨论保证完成年度计划的时候，工人们提出把临时检修水泥磨的方法改为大检修，使工厂今年多生产了两千多吨水泥。
    7月份，全厂职工在研究提前完成五年计划的时候，机电科的人员提出再增加一个粗碎磨。在厂的领导干部支持下，技术人员自己设计并利用本厂的旧料、废料制成了这部磨，全年因此增加了三万吨水泥。
    今年工资改革中，厂的领导方面把评定方案交给职工代表大会反复讨论修订，工人们反映这次工资评定工作是做得最好的一次。
    太原水泥厂的职工代表大会制度是1950年建立的。1953年以后，曾一度流于形式，以后才逐渐健全起来。今年，厂里许多困难的工作都因为依靠职工代表大会得到顺利解决，因此这个厂领导干部更认识到了职工代表大会的重要。
