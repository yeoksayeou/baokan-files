    Artificial Satellite
　　Du Lianyao
    The International Geophysical Year (1957-1958), which is also a year of relatively high solar activity, is approaching. At that time, scientists from more than forty countries will be working together in various parts of the world to observe and study important problems in geophysics, and to exchange scientific data obtained from these observations. The Earth is a whole in the universe, and the observation and study of its physical phenomena and its surrounding environment should also be holistic and comprehensive. In order to obtain systematic and relatively precise measurement results, this large-scale international cooperation is essential. It will help us understand more about the Earth that humanity has inhabited for so long.
    In the International Geophysical Year, artificial satellites will be an epoch-making event in the process of mankind conquering nature; at the same time, it will also be the event that arouses the greatest interest among people. The successful manufacture of artificial satellites, in addition to its important military significance and further revealing the secrets of the universe, providing us with much scientific data that cannot be obtained on the ground, also lays the foundation for interstellar travel for mankind to reach other planets.
    What is an artificial satellite? Simply put, it is a satellite created by artificial means that orbits in the air along a certain orbit like other satellites. Because it is man-made, people can pre-arrange its orbit, lifespan, and the scientific instruments it should carry, so that it can make scientific observations and records at high altitudes that humans cannot reach.
    The launch of an artificial satellite utilizes the high speed and altitude that can be obtained by a rocket, projecting it into a predetermined orbit. In order for the satellite to orbit the Earth without quickly falling back to the ground due to the Earth's gravitational pull, it must have a sufficiently high operating speed to balance its centrifugal force with the Earth's gravitational pull. The higher the satellite's orbit from the ground, the greater the required speed. For example, in an orbit 500 kilometers high, it must have a speed of 27,000 kilometers per hour.
    The rocket currently planned to be used has three stages. The satellite is placed at the front of the rocket. In order to prevent the satellite from burning due to friction with the air when flying in the lower atmosphere, a conical protector is added to the outside of the satellite. The first and middle stages of the rocket contain fuel, in addition to some automatic control instruments. To save space, the fuel used in the rocket is liquid, such as liquid oxygen and gasoline. When the rocket takes off, it rises vertically along a straight line perpendicular to the ground. When the fuel in the first stage of the rocket is used up, it can reach an altitude of 60 kilometers, and the outer shell of this stage of the rocket will automatically fall off, gliding forward for about 350 kilometers before falling back to the ground. The liquid fuel in the second stage of the rocket begins to burn after the first stage is detached, and the internal equipment automatically controls and adjusts the direction of the rocket, causing it to gradually tilt, forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the vertical line to the ground. When the fuel in the second stage is used up, the rocket can reach a height of 200 kilometers, but the speed it possesses can continue to allow it to rise to a height of 500 kilometers. At this time, the cone-shaped shell protecting the satellite is also discarded, and the second and third stages slide forward simultaneously, changing to a direction parallel to the horizon, causing the satellite to spin. The fuel in the third stage of the rocket is solid. After burning out, the satellite will have the necessary speed to fly forward. At this point, the artificial satellite becomes a satellite of the Earth. Like other satellites, its orbit and speed will no longer be controlled by humans on the ground.
    In the process of takeoff, the second stage of the rocket is the main part controlling the flight. Because of the accumulation of errors during flight, and our lack of detailed knowledge of the structure of the upper atmosphere, the final launch angle is not exactly zero, so the satellite's orbit will be elliptical. Its closest point to the ground is about 300 kilometers, and its farthest point is about 1,500 kilometers. Because the air at high altitudes is thin, the resistance to the satellite's flight is minimal. Therefore, the satellite can orbit the Earth for one year in an orbit 500 kilometers high; while at 300 kilometers high, it can only fly for a dozen days. Finally, the satellite will enter the denser air layer on the ground along a spiral orbit and burn up. The time required for the satellite to orbit the Earth once is about 90 minutes. Structurally speaking, using a single-stage rocket is the simplest, but it is not easy to reach the predetermined height and speed. If the total weight of the rocket is fixed, the speed obtained by using two stages is 33% higher than using one stage, and the speed obtained by using three stages is 45% higher than using one stage. However, when the number of stages is increased without limit, the speed cannot be increased without limit. For example, when the number of stages is increased to infinity, the speed only increases by 70%. Therefore, three stages is a more suitable number of stages.
    After the artificial satellite and rocket are launched, tracking and remote measurement become very important issues. Without tracking, it would be difficult for us to know the accurate position and speed of the artificial satellite, making the work of many ground observation stations difficult. Without remote measurement, we would not be able to obtain the scientific data collected on the artificial satellite, which would defeat the purpose of the artificial satellite.
    Tracking methods can be divided into two types: one is optical. Observation stations distributed on the ground can use telescopes with large viewing angles and low magnification and stopwatches to measure the speed and position of the satellite. Cameras can also be used to obtain permanent records. However, the focal length of the optical system should not be too long, otherwise the speed of the satellite image will be too high, making it difficult to measure. The accuracy of the observation depends on the observer's purpose. If the purpose of the observation is to receive remote measurement records, then the accuracy of the observation time needs to be within a few seconds; if the purpose of the observation is for geodetic surveying, then the time measurement must be accurate to milliseconds (one thousandth of a second).
    Optical methods must be used under appropriate brightness and perspective distance to obtain satisfactory results, so they are limited by weather and time; however, if other tracking methods fail due to unexpected events, it will be the only method to obtain data. Especially at the end of the satellite's life, the satellite will rapidly enter areas with denser air along a spiral orbit. At this time, all changes in the orbit and the satellite itself are rapid, and precise measurement is more difficult. Optical methods will become necessary.
    Another tracking method is radio physics. A radio station with a very stable frequency and low power is installed on the satellite, broadcasting electromagnetic waves vibrating at 108 megacycles per second to the ground at any time. From the timing of the electromagnetic waves received from two observation stations on the ground (calculated using the phase angle difference), the speed and position of the satellite can be measured. The transmitter on the satellite is controlled from the ground. It only starts transmitting to the ground when it is close to the observation station and receives commands from the ground, which can save power on the satellite. Radio physics methods are not limited by weather and time. Observations can be carried out regardless of sunny or cloudy days, day or night, and the data obtained is also very accurate.
    The volume and carrying capacity of artificial satellites are subject to strict restrictions. Increasing the weight by half a kilogram is enough to reduce the speed by about 100 kilometers per hour. The artificial satellites currently being designed weigh no more than ten kilograms. The most suitable shape for measuring high-altitude air density is spherical, so it may be a sphere with a diameter of about 50 centimeters; if it is to install more instruments, it may also be a cylinder with a length of 45 centimeters and a diameter of 15 centimeters. In any case, the transmitter to be installed on the satellite must be lightweight and reliable in structure. There are already two designs in the experimental stage. One is to use small-volume and low-power vacuum tubes, weighing about one and a half kilograms, including antennas and batteries. The other is to use crystal tubes, weighing about one kilogram. However, at high frequencies, vacuum tubes are better than crystal tubes, because crystal tubes require insulation equipment. Regardless of which type of tube is used, there must be a crystal-stabilized frequency device. The power supply on the satellite is provided by batteries. The selection of batteries is also a major issue. In addition to being lightweight and small in size, the battery must be able to maintain its original performance in a high vacuum. The currently used solar cells have many advantages, but their reliability at high altitudes remains to be verified.
    For a long time, humans have been restricted by the Earth's gravity and unable to make measurements at high altitudes to further understand many physical phenomena, but scientists have not abandoned this attempt. Initially, they used methods such as flying kites and balloons to high mountains to conduct experiments in high altitudes. Although the altitude they could reach was only a few dozen kilometers, their gains were rich, obtaining much information that could not be obtained on the ground, such as the establishment of the troposphere and the absorption of the solar spectrum. However, there are many interesting problems that must be observed above the ionosphere (about 400 kilometers high) in order to obtain more meaningful results. Because the ionosphere is a layer of conductive gas, it affects cosmic electromagnetic waves and other particles emitted from the sun and stars. After World War II, rockets could be used to explore altitudes of 300 kilometers; however, rockets can only make rapid observations in the short time of ascent and descent, and cannot make long-term average measurements of certain phenomena. Artificial satellites can not only reach higher altitudes (about 500 kilometers from the ground), but also fly at high altitudes for a longer time (tens to hundreds of days), and can travel over vast areas. Therefore, it has special advantages.
    The application of artificial satellites can also help study some important problems in geophysics. The following are a few examples of applications:
    The density of air decreases the higher it is from the ground. At the orbit of an artificial satellite, the thinness of the air is equivalent to the high vacuum inside a vacuum tube. Therefore, the satellite is only subject to slight resistance when flying. However, this slight resistance will eventually slowly reduce the satellite's speed, causing its orbit to gradually approach the ground. Therefore, the air density at various altitudes can be obtained from the changes in orbit and speed. This is of great value for studying chemical changes in the upper atmosphere.
    Ground-based magnetic storms are caused by particles emitted by the sun. The pressure of the particles causes the Earth's magnetic field to contract, resulting in a sudden increase in the magnetic field on the ground. If this phenomenon is observed above the ionosphere, the distortions and attenuations caused by the ionosphere can be avoided.
    The question of whether very small, lighter atomic nuclei, such as boron, lithium, and beryllium, exist in cosmic rays in high altitudes must be determined using long-term accumulation observation methods. Artificial satellites can fly at high altitudes for a long time and can be used to observe similar problems.
    The reason for the changes in the intensity of cosmic rays on the ground is whether there is also an attenuation of kinetic energy in addition to the reduction in the number of rays.
    The change in atmospheric temperature with altitude is not as simple as the change in density. At an altitude of about 25 kilometers, the temperature is at its lowest, about minus 80 degrees Celsius; in the zone of 40 to 50 kilometers high, the ozone molecules formed by photochemical changes in the air increase, absorbing solar energy and causing the temperature to rise to zero degrees Celsius. After that, the temperature drops to its lowest again at 80 kilometers high. When rising to 160 kilometers, the temperature will reach 1,000 degrees Celsius. Artificial satellites will provide new data on the temperature of the high-altitude atmosphere.
    In addition, there are many other scientific problems that can be observed and studied using artificial satellites, such as the Earth's magnetic field, the ionosphere itself and its boundaries, crustal equilibrium and the geoid, geodetic surveying, glaciology, oceanography, aurora, relativity, and the Earth's albedo.
    Finally, it should be pointed out that the success and application of artificial satellites depend on highly precise technology in radio physics. From the control of rocket launches to the long-distance transmission of data from artificial satellites, the entire process is inseparable from radio physics.

    人造卫星

    国际地球物理年（1957—1958），也是太阳黑斑比较活动的一年即将到来，届时将有四十几国的科学工作者，在地球上的各地，共同从事于地球物理中各项重要问题的观测和研究，并交换关于这方面观测所得的科学资料。地球是宇宙空间中的一个整体，对它以及它周围环境的物理现象的观测和研究，也应该是整体的全面的。为了能够得到有系统的和比较精密的测量结果，这种大规模的国际合作是十分必需的。它将使我们更多明白一些关于人类寄居了很久的地球。
    在国际地球物理年中，人造卫星将是人类在征服大自然过程中的一个开纪元的重要事件；同时，它也将是引起人们最大兴趣的事件。人造卫星的制造成功，除了军事上的重要意义和进一步地揭露宇宙间的秘密，供给我们许多地面上得不到的科学资料外，它还为人类到达其他星球的星际航行奠定基础。
    什么是人造卫星呢？简单地说，它是用人工的方法造成的一颗卫星，和其他卫星一样在空中按一定的轨道运行。因为它是人造的，人就可以预先安排它的轨道、寿命和它上面所应负载的科学仪器，以便在人类不能到达的高空作科学观测和记录。
    人造卫星的起飞，是利用火箭所能得到的大速度和能到达的高度，把它投射到预定的轨道中去。要想使卫星绕地球飞行，不致受地心引力而迅速地落返地面，它必须具有相当大的运行速度，使它所具有的离心力和地心引力相平衡。卫星的轨道离地愈高，所需的速度也愈大。例如，在五百公里高的轨道上，它必须有每小时两万七千公里的速度。
    目前打算使用的火箭是三节的。卫星放在火箭的前端。为了在低空大气层内飞行时不致因为和空气摩擦而燃烧，卫星的外面再加以椎形的保护器。火箭的第一节和中间一节内，除一部分自动控制的仪器外，均为燃料。为节省空间计，火箭所用的燃料是液体的，如液体氧和汽油等。火箭起飞时，沿垂直地面的直线上升。火箭的第一节内燃料用完时，可达六十公里的高度，这一节火箭的外壳就自动脱落，向前滑行约三百五十公里而落返地面。火箭第二节内的液体燃料于第一节脱落后就开始燃烧，内部装备自动控制和调整火箭进行的方向，使它逐渐倾斜，与垂直地面的直线成约四十五度的角。当第二节内燃料用完时，火箭可达二百公里高，但它所具有的速度可继续使它上升到五百公里高。此时，保护卫星的椎形外壳也被丢掉，第二、三节同时前滑，并转变为和地平行的方向，使卫星产生自旋。火箭第三节内的燃料是固体的，烧完后卫星将具有必需的速度向前飞。到此，人造卫星就成为地球的一个卫星，和其他卫星一样，它的轨道和速度等将不再受地面上人类的控制。
    在起飞的过程中，火箭第二节是控制飞行的主要部分，因为飞行时误差的积累，以及我们对高空大气层的结构情况不详，致最后投射角不正好为零，所以卫星的轨道将为椭圆形。它距地面最近点约三百公里，最远点约一千五百公里。因为高空空气稀薄，对卫星飞行的阻力极小，所以卫星在五百公里高的轨道上，可以绕地球飞行一年；而在三百公里高时，只能飞行十数日。最后，卫星将沿旋涡式的轨道进入地面上密度较大的空气层内而燃烧毁灭。卫星绕地球一周所需的时间约为九十分钟。从构造上讲用一节火箭最为简单，但不易到达预定的高度和速度。如火箭的总重量一定，则用两节比用一节所能得到的速度高33％，用三节比用一节高45％。但节数无限制地增多时，并不能无限制地增高速度。例如节数增到无数多时，速度只增高70％。所以三节是比较适宜的节数。
    人造卫星和火箭起飞后，跟踪和远程测量遂成为非常重要的问题，没有跟踪，我们就很难知道人造卫星的准确位置和它的速度，致使地面上许多观测站工作困难。没有远程测量，我们就无法得到在人造卫星上所搜集的科学资料，就是失去了人造卫星的目的。
    跟踪的方法可分两种，一种是光学的，在地面上分布的观测站用视角大而倍数低的望远镜和停表就可测量卫星的速度和位置；也可以采用照相机而得到永久性的记录。但光学系统的焦点距不可太长，否则卫星影像的速度较大，不易测量。观测的准确度视观测者的目的而定，如观测的目的是为收到远程测量的记录，则观测时间的准确度到几秒钟即可；如观测的目的是为了大地测绘，则时间的测量即须准确到毫秒（千分之一秒）。
    光学的方法必须在亮度及透视距离适当的情况下，才能得到满意的结果，因此它受天气和时间的限制；但如果其他跟踪方法因意外而发生故障时，它将是获得数据的唯一方法。特别是在卫星寿命的末期，卫星将沿旋涡式轨道迅速的进入空气较密的地区，这时轨道及卫星本身的一切变化都是急剧的，精密测量比较困难，用光学方法将成为必需的。
    另外一种跟踪方法是无线电物理学的。在卫星上安装一个频率非常稳定而功率小的发射电台，随时向地面播送每秒振动一百零八兆周的电磁波，从地面上两观测站收到电磁波时间的前后（用相角差来计算），就可测得卫星的速度和位置。卫星上的发射电台是受地面上控制的，只有靠近观测站，收到地面上的号令时，才开始向地面发射，这样可以节省卫星上的用电量。无线电物理的方法，不受天气和时间的限制，不论阴晴昼夜，都可进行观测，而且所得的数据也十分精确。
    人造卫星的体积和载重量都受有严格的限制。重量增多半公斤，就足以使速度每小时降低约一百公里。现在设计的人造卫星，全重不过十余公斤。测量高空大气密度最适宜的形状是球形，因此它可能是一个直径约五十糎的圆球；如果为了能安装较多的仪器，它也可能是一个长四十五糎直径十五糎的圆柱体。无论如何，卫星上要安装的发射电台，其结构必须轻巧可靠。现在已有两种设计在实验时期，一种是采用小体积和小功率的真空电子管的，连天线和电池等在内，重约一公斤半。另一种是采用晶体电子管的，全重约一公斤。但在高频时，真空电子管较优于晶体电子管，因为用晶体电子管时还需要保温的设备。不论采用哪一种电子管，都要有晶体稳定频率的装置。卫星上的电源，是用电池供给的，对电池的选择也是一个很大的问题。除了重量轻、体积小以外，电池必须能在高度真空内维持原有的性能。目前所采用的日光电池优点很多，但它在高空内的可靠性，还待验证。
    很久以来，人类受地心引力的限制，不能到高空作测量，以进一步了解许多物理现象，但科学工作者并没有放弃这种企图。最初他们采用上高山放风筝和放气球等方法到高空去作实验，虽然所能到达的高度只有几十公里，但他们的收获是丰富的，得到许多在地面上得不到的资料，如同温层的确立，太阳光谱的吸收问题等。然而，有许多有趣的问题必须在离子层（约四百公里高）上面作观测，才能得到更有意义的成果。因为离子层是一层导电的气体，它对宇宙线电磁波和其他从太阳及星体发射出来的粒子都有影响。第二次世界大战以后，采用火箭可以探测到三百公里的高空；但火箭只能在上升和下降的短时间作快速的观测，不能对某些现象作长时间平均的测量。人造卫星不但能到达更高的高空（约距地面五百公里），还能在高空飞行较长的时间（十数日至数百日），并能行经广大的地区上空。因此，它有特殊的优点。
    人造卫星的应用还可以帮助研究地球物理中一些重要问题，以下是几个应用的例子：
    空气的密度离地面愈高愈小，在人造卫星的轨道处，空气稀薄的程度相当于真空电子管内的高度真空。所以卫星飞行时只受到轻微的阻力。但这轻微的阻力，终能使卫星的速度慢慢减少，使它的轨道逐渐靠近地面。因此，从轨道和速度的变化，可以求得各种不同高度处的空气密度。这对研究上层空气内的化学变化有重要价值。
    地面上的磁暴，是因为太阳发射出来的粒子所引起的，粒子的压力使地球的磁场收缩，遂造成地面上磁场的骤然增大。如在离子层上面去观测这一现象，将可以免去因离子层而引起的畸变和衰减等现象。
    高空中宇宙射线内数量非常微小的较轻的原子核如硼、锂、铍等是否存在的问题必须采用长时积累的观测方法，才能确定。人造卫星能在高空飞行较长的时间可对类似的问题加以观测。
    地面上宇宙射线强度变化的原因，除了射线数目低减外，是否还有动能的衰减。
    大气温度随高度的变化并不像密度变化那样简单。在约二十五公里高时，温度最低，约为摄氏表负八十度；在四十至五十公里高的地带，空气中因光生化学变化而成的臭氧分子加多，遂吸收太阳能而温度上升至摄氏零度。此后，到八十公里高时，温度又降至最低。及至上升到一百六十公里时，温度将达摄氏表一千度。人造卫星将对高空大气的温度，提供新的资料。
    此外还有许多其他科学问题可以应用人造卫星来观测和研究，例如地球磁场，离子层本身和它的界限，地壳平衡和水准面，大地测绘、冰山学、海洋学、极光、相对论和地球的反照率等。
    最后应该指出，人造卫星的成功和运用，有赖于无线电物理学中高度精确技术。从火箭起飞的控制到人造卫星的远距离传输数据，全部过程是离不开无线电物理学的。
