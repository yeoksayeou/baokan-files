Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 24th: Japanese Prime Minister Ishibashi Tanzan, after forming his cabinet, said at his first press conference today: "Independent diplomacy and active economic policies are the two pillars (of the new cabinet's policies)."

Ishibashi said, when talking about the new cabinet's foreign policy, that his cabinet would not change the policy of cooperating with the United States, but would not adopt a policy of leaning entirely to the United States. Regarding relations with China, Ishibashi said that he would consult with the United States to promote economic relations with China as much as possible, and he also expressed the hope that the United Nations would change its current attitude towards China. Ishibashi also said that he would carry out technical cooperation and investment with Asian and African countries. Ishibashi said that his cabinet would start negotiations with the Soviet Union on concluding a peace treaty as soon as possible; in addition, it would step up efforts to adjust Japan's relations with South Korea.

On the domestic front, the Prime Minister said that he wanted to prepare the next fiscal year's budget when the Diet reconvenes in January next year, and he believes it is necessary to implement tax cuts. Ishibashi also reiterated that he does not intend to dissolve the House of Representatives at this time.

Ishibashi said that in the future, on foreign policy and important domestic issues, he would consult with the Socialist Party in advance. He reiterated his hope to eliminate factional struggles within the ruling party, and said that unless it is necessary, he would not appoint a Deputy Prime Minister or Deputy President.

The new Minister of Foreign Affairs, Kishi Nobusuke, also issued a statement last night. He said: "The basic policy that Japan wants to pursue is to contribute to world peace as a member of the United Nations." He believes that "it is necessary to further strengthen diplomacy with the United States in order to establish cooperative relations." He said that for China, "we will mainly adopt active policies in terms of economy and trade. However, I don't think it is appropriate to immediately consider establishing diplomatic and political relations."

    石桥谈新内阁施政方针
    推行自主外交和积极经济政策
    据新华社24日讯　东京消息：日本新任首相石桥湛山今天在组阁后的第一次记者招待会上说：“自主外交和积极经济政策是（新内阁政策的）两个支柱”。
    石桥谈到新内阁的外交政策时说，他的内阁将不改变同美国实行合作的方针，但是不采取向美国一边倒的方针。关于同中国的关系，石桥表示要同美国进行协商，尽可能地促进同中国的经济关系，他并且表示希望联合国改变现在对中国的态度。石桥还表示要同亚非国家实行技术合作，并且进行投资。石桥说，他的内阁要尽早地同苏联开始举行缔结和约的谈判；另外还要加紧调整日本同南朝鲜的关系。
    在内政方面，这位首相说，他想争取在明年1月国会复会的时候编制好明年度的财政预算，他认为有必要实行减税。石桥并且重申，他现在不打算解散众议院。
    石桥说，今后在外交政策和重要的内政问题上，要预先同社会党商量。他再次表示希望消除执政党内派系斗争，并且说除非到了需要的时候，不设置副首相和副总裁。
    新任外务相岸信介在昨天晚上也发表谈话。他说：“日本所要推行的基本方针是，以联合国一员的资格，对世界和平作出贡献。”他认为“必须进一步加强对美国的外交，以便建立合作关系。”他说，对于中国，“主要是在经济和贸易方面采取积极的政策。但是，我认为，立刻考虑建立外交上和政治上的关系还不是适当的”。
