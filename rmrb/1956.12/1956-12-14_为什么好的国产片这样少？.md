    "Why Are There So Few Good Domestically Produced Films?"
    The Shanghai Wenhui Daily has launched a discussion on the question of "Why are there so few good domestically produced films?" since November 14th. Screenwriters, directors, actors, art designers, sound engineers, and film audiences have all participated in the discussion.
    According to the distribution figures of domestically produced films in Shanghai, the lowest attendance rate is 9%. Some moviegoers said that the reasons they do not like to watch domestically produced films are the narrow subject matter, dull and boring plots, lack of national characteristics, and somewhat formulaic film titles. Many film workers pointed out that since national liberation, through the criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and the study of literary and artistic rectification, the literary and artistic thinking of film workers in general has improved; however, there has never been an in-depth discussion of the characteristics of film art and the traditions of Chinese film art. Some believe that there were many films in the past that are worth referring to and studying by today's film workers to absorb their advantages. At that time, film companies and screenwriters, directors, and actors divided their work according to their respective strengths in order to meet the diverse needs of the broad audience, paying attention to the characteristics and artistic styles of different types of films. Some said that there have been different evaluations of some films within the film industry since liberation, but there has been no well-organized discussion and research. Some believe that there are problems with the current film production work system, which affects the improvement of the quality of domestically produced films.
    Some screenwriters have requested that relevant leading organizations pay attention to the characteristics and laws of film art, improve the review procedures, and change the situation of excessive interference by leaders in creation. For example, a script has to go through multiple levels of scrutiny, and although the opinions put forward at each level are "for reference," in fact, it will not pass unless it is revised accordingly. Sometimes, a sentence of dialogue or a single word is revised back and forth, seriously affecting the author's creative interest and enthusiasm for work. They believe that artistic issues, especially certain issues in a work, should not be scrutinized too closely, and the author's labor should be respected. Works that are revised to be bland and unremarkable often lose their artistic features and are not liked by the audience. Some film directors believe that the director is the center of the film production collective. The collective labor of screenwriters, actors, photographers, sound engineers, art designers, and all the staff of the production crew can only obtain a complete artistic product under the centralized command of the director. However, the current production organization for film production is not centered on the director, but on the administrative leader. They expressed dissatisfaction with this approach. Most actors are suffering from a lack of roles to play. They said that the Shanghai Film Studio has gathered many talented actors, but some have not filmed a single film in seven years; they spend all year studying and rehearsing without the opportunity to perform officially. And when they occasionally have a chance to film, they don't know what to do in front of the camera. Actors are becoming increasingly alienated from the audience. They demand more films to be made, and if there is a shortage of film scripts, they should also be organized to perform more stage plays to continuously improve their artistic level. Art designers and sound engineers also raised opinions on the problems that exist in their work. This discussion is helpful for the improvement of film work.

### “为什么好的国产片这样少？”

    “为什么好的国产片这样少？”
    上海文汇报自11月14日起展开了“为什么好的国产片这样少？”这一问题的讨论，电影编剧、导演、演员、美术设计、录音师以及电影观众都参加了讨论。
    根据国产片在上海的发行数字，上座率最低到9％。有些电影观众说他们不爱看国产片的原因，是题材狭窄，情节枯燥无味，缺乏民族特色，片名也有些公式化。不少电影工作者指出：全国解放以来，通过对电影“武训传”的批判和文艺整风等学习，一般电影工作者的文艺思想有了提高；但对电影艺术的特点和我国电影艺术的传统，却一直没有进行深入的探讨。有的认为过去有不少影片值得今天的电影工作者参考、研究，吸取它们的优点。当时的影片公司和影片编剧、导演、演员为了满足广大观众的多样需要，根据各自的长处作了分工，注意不同类型影片的特点和艺术风格。有的说解放以来电影界内部对有些片子评价不一，但没有很好地组织讨论、研究，有的认为目前电影生产的工作制度有问题，影响了国产影片质量的提高。
    有些电影编剧人员要求有关领导机构注意电影艺术的特点和规律，改进审稿手续，改变领导上对于创作干预过多的情况。例如一个剧本要重重过关，每个关口提的意见虽是“供参考”，但事实上不照改就通不过。有时一句对话、一个字眼改来改去，严重地影响了作者的创作兴味和工作积极性。他们认为对艺术问题，特别是对一部作品中的某些问题，不能扣得太死，应该尊重作者的劳动。被改得四平八稳的作品，往往失掉艺术特色，观众不爱看。有些电影导演认为导演本是影片生产集体的中心，编剧、演员和摄影、录音、美术以及全摄制组的工作人员的集体劳动，在导演的集中指挥下，才获得一个完整的艺术产品。可是，目前摄制影片的生产组织却不是以导演为中心，而是以行政领导者为中心。他们对这样做法表示不满。演员们大都苦于没有戏演。他们说上海电影制片厂集中了许多演员人才，但有的七年没有拍过一部片子；终年学习、排练，没有正式演戏的机会。而偶尔有一个拍片的机会，到了摄影机前，就不晓得怎么好。演员们和观众越来越疏远了。他们要求多拍片子，如果电影剧本缺乏，也应该组织他们多演出话剧，不断提高艺术水平。美术设计和录音师等也对他们工作中存在的问题提出了意见。这个讨论对于电影工作的改进是有帮助的。
