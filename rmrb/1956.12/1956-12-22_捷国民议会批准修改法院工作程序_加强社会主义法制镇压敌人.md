Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 21st: The Czechoslovak News Agency reported that the Czechoslovak National Assembly held meetings on December 19th and 20th to discuss and approve draft laws concerning amendments to court procedures.

	During the discussion on the 19th, Deputy and Minister of Justice Škodda spoke about the draft laws amending court procedures, particularly criminal proceedings, criminal law, and prosecutorial work. He said that the draft laws proposed by the government are based on the conclusions put forward by the Czechoslovak Communist Party's National Congress and accepted by the National Front. Its purpose is to further strengthen the socialist legal system. These laws are a powerful weapon against all enemies who attempt to disrupt our people's democratic system and to defend the socialist construction achievements of the working people.

	Škodda pointed out that the purpose of the proposed draft laws is not only to punish criminal acts but also to make society more clearly aware that no criminal act can go undetected and unpunished by law. The amendment also emphasizes that the defendant cannot be considered a criminal until the case has been fully and conclusively proven. A new investigative body will soon be established within the Prosecutor's Office and the Ministry of Interior. Prosecutors will supervise the investigation work and have the power to require them to report and inspect their work.

	At the meeting on the 20th, a new Sports Organization Law and a new Housing Law were discussed and passed.

    捷国民议会批准修改法院工作程序
    加强社会主义法制镇压敌人
    据新华社布拉格21日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克国民议会在12月19日和20日举行会议，讨论和批准了有关修改法院工作程序等的法律草案。
    在19日会议的讨论中，议员、司法部长什科达就修改法院工作程序、特别是刑事诉讼、刑法和检察工作等的法律草案发了言。他说，政府所提出的法律草案是以捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议提出的、已经为民族阵线所接受的结论为根据的，它的宗旨是要进一步加强社会主义法制。这些法律是对付企图扰乱我们的人民民主制度的一切敌人和保卫劳动人民的社会主义建设成就的一种有力的武器。
    什科达指出，所提出的法律草案的目的不仅在于惩罚犯罪行动，而且还在于使社会更清楚地意识到，没有一个犯罪行动能够不被揭露和不依法律予以惩罚。修正草案中还强调，只要案情还没有充分地和确凿地证实，被告就不能被认为是罪犯。在检察署和内务部范围内的一个新的调查机构即将成立。检察官将监督调查工作，并有要求他们报告和检查工作的权力。
    在20日的会议上，讨论和通过了关于新的体育运动组织法案和新的房屋法案。
