　　Adjusting Upwards and Releasing Downwards
　　Wu Lü
　　"A thousand rivers flow to the sea, ten thousand tasks weigh down." This is a couplet that vividly describes the suffering of grassroots cadres in enterprises. Of course, saying there are "ten thousand tasks" is an exaggeration, but it reflects the frustration of grassroots cadres in their work. The grassroots level (referring to enterprises here) is the front line of combat, and all policies, instructions, and regulations must be implemented through it. The heavy burden of tasks at the grassroots level is self-evident. Talking with grassroots cadres, one often hears them calling for higher authorities to strengthen leadership over their work.
　　However, in some enterprises, once the higher authorities strengthen their leadership, the grassroots level starts complaining. One of the reasons is that these higher authorities, once they strengthen leadership, first increase institutions and expand staffing, and then draw cadres from below. These things have already become commonplace.
　　To strengthen leadership, it is necessary to carry out some organizational construction; it is also appropriate for grassroots enterprises to provide cadres for higher-level organs. The problem is that many institutions have no need to be established, many organs become bloated after their staffing is expanded, and too many cadres at the grassroots level are transferred too quickly, leading to a shortage of personnel. Just imagine: if the aim is to strengthen leadership and help the grassroots level do its job well, why transfer large numbers of cadres from the grassroots level to the top, and build a huge organization there? What will be the result? The result is likely to be: the leadership's power is strengthened, but the grassroots level's power is weakened, and the work may not really be improved. Because the usual situation is: when the upper-level organization is large, there are bound to be many levels, cumbersome procedures, dense official documents, slow problem-solving, and increased suffering of cadres who are busy doing nothing, and bureaucracy and red tape will emerge. These are precisely unfavorable to strengthening leadership.
　　So, how to strengthen leadership and how to help the grassroots level improve its work? There are many ways. On the issue of cadres, a very important method is to appropriately send cadres, especially technical cadres, down to the grassroots level to enrich it. Only when the grassroots level can become a strong outpost can the work be done well, and leadership will be more convenient. Chongqing Yuhua Textile Factory is an example. They transferred seventeen technical personnel from offices and workshop functional groups to serve as workshop directors, deputy directors, technicians, and foremen. Once these comrades arrived in the workshops, they were like fish in water. They relied on the masses and studied the production situation. The work in the workshops greatly improved, the rate of white flowers in the spinning workshop decreased month by month, and the rate of broken cars also decreased compared to before.
　　The State Council recently issued a notice "on stopping the increase of institutions and the expansion of staffing in state organs." In my opinion, enterprise departments should also consider the issue of the institutions and staffing of their departments and units in accordance with the spirit of this notice, and no longer blindly add institutions and increase staffing. If there is a phenomenon of overstaffing, it is appropriate to transfer some people down to the grassroots level. This is only beneficial to strengthening leadership and improving work, and there is no harm in it.

　　往上调和往下放

    “千条河流归大海，万种任务压下来”。这是一副专道企业基层干部苦情的对联。当然，说有“万种任务”，只是一种夸张的形容；但是这里反映了基层干部工作中的苦闷。基层（这里指的是企业），是作战的第一线，一切方针政策、指示规程，都要通过它贯彻下去。基层任务之重，自不待言。同基层干部谈话，也常听得他们呼吁：希望上级对他们的工作加强领导。
    但是，有些企业的上级一旦加强领导，反而听见基层叫苦。原因之一是，这些上级不加强领导则已，一加强领导，首先就是增设机构，扩大编制，接着就是从下面抽调干部。这些已经是屡见不鲜的事情了。
    为了加强领导，相应地进行一些组织建设，原是必要的；基层企业为上级机关输送干部，也是应该的。问题在于不少机构原无增设之必要，不少机关的编制扩大后反而臃肿，不少基层的干部被调得过多、过急了，青黄不接。试想：既然是要加强领导，是要帮助基层把工作做好，反而把基层的干部大批大批地往上调，在上面建立了一个庞大的机构，会产生什么结果呢？结果恐怕是：领导的力量加强了，基层的力量反而削弱了，工作未必真有改进。因为通常的情况总是：上面机构一大，层次必多、手续必繁、公文必密、解决问题必慢、干部无事忙之苦必增，官僚主义、文牍主义也应运而生。这些，对于加强领导恰恰是不利的。
    那么，怎样加强领导，怎样帮助基层改进工作呢？办法很多。在干部问题上，一条很重要的办法就是：适当地把干部、特别是技术干部送到下面去，去充实基层。只有基层能成为一个强有力的前哨阵地，工作才能做好，领导起来也比较方便。重庆裕华纺织厂就是一个例子。他们从科室和工场职能组中抽调了十七名技术人员分别到车间担任车间主任、副主任、技术员、工长等工作。这些同志一到车间，如鱼得水，他们依靠群众，研究生产情况，车间工作大有起色，细纱车间白花率逐月下降，坏车率也比以前减少了。
    国务院最近发布了“关于国家机关停止增设机构扩大编制”的通知。依我看，企业部门也应该根据这个通知的精神，考虑一下本部门、本单位的机构和编制问题，不要再盲目地添机构，增编制了；若有人浮于事的现象，倒是该适当地抽一部分人到下面去。这对于加强领导、改进工作是只有好处，没有坏处的。
