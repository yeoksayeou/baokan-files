A Visit to Tunisia
Li Xuechun

(I) Tunisia and China

In August of this year, at the invitation of the Tunisian National Student Union, we visited Tunisia as representatives of Chinese university students.

Tunisia is a country in North Africa with a population of 3.5 million. Half of its territory borders the Mediterranean Sea. Olive trees and fig trees grow everywhere, and wheat production is abundant. It is a beautiful and rich country. However, the Tunisian people have historically suffered oppression from the Roman Empire, the Vandals, the Western Roman Empire, Turkey, and the Arabs. For nearly seventy years, the iron heel of French imperialism has been trampling on the Tunisian people. The Tunisian people have lived an extremely miserable life. On March 20th of this year, after a long anti-colonial struggle, the Tunisian people finally achieved national independence.

In ancient times, there were friendly exchanges between Chinese and Tunisian people. In 802 AD, Chinese merchants brought tea, silk, pottery, and oranges to Tunisia, and Chinese papermaking technology was also introduced to Tunisia. At that time, Tunisians also came to China. However, in the past century, due to the obstruction of colonialists, friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Tunisian people have been cut off. Therefore, we are the first Chinese to visit Tunisia in nearly a century.

With the rise of the national liberation movement in Asia and Africa, especially due to the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and the national independence achieved by the Tunisian people, the friendship between the Chinese and Tunisian people will enter a new chapter.

(II) At the Paris Airport

At 7:20 am on July 15th, we left Beijing Airport by plane, passing through Ulaanbaatar, Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague, and arrived at Paris Airport at 2:00 pm on July 30th.

We were travelers from a people's democratic country, so unlike ordinary travelers, we were greeted by three plainclothes police officers.

"Where are you going?"

"Tunisia."

"Do you have a French visa?"

"No, we are going to Tunisia at the invitation of the Tunisian Student Union."

"Do you have a Tunisian entry visa?"

"The Tunisian Student Union has a telegram guaranteeing that we will get a visa at the Tunisian airport."

"Without a destination visa, you cannot stay at the Paris airport."

In order to obtain a Tunisian visa immediately, we called the Tunisian Embassy in Paris. It was already 8:00 pm. However, the Tunisian Ambassador to Paris personally brought the visa to the airport, wanting to hand it to us immediately. An intolerable phenomenon occurred: the Paris police did not allow the Tunisian Ambassador to meet with us, nor did they allow the visa to be transferred to us.

The airport police actually said such a thing to us: "If you want to go to Tunisia, you must have a French visa, because Tunisia is a province of France." It seems that some people in France are still unwilling to admit the fact that the Tunisian people have already freed themselves from seventy years of French colonial rule and gained independence on March 20th of this year.

After that, we were ordered not to leave the airport and to wait for a reply.

We had to spend the night on the sofas at the Paris airport. After breakfast the next morning, the police informed us: "Your return tickets to Prague have been booked, and the plane will take off immediately."

Due to French obstruction, we had already missed the Tunisian Student Congress held from August 1st to 3rd. However, the imperialists cannot stop the friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Tunisian people. We detoured through Rome and Cairo and finally met with the Tunisian people on August 6th.

(III) Arrival in Tunisia

At 4:30 pm on August 6th, the plane we were on entered Tunisian territory. The turquoise Mediterranean Sea, the winding coastline, the white-domed mosques nestled in the green olive groves, the beautiful Tunisian land came into our view.

At 5:00 pm, the plane landed at the Tunisian airport. Greeting us at the airport were enthusiastic and energetic young people.

Because Tunisia had been independent for less than five months, and some handover procedures had not been completed, most of the police and officials at the Tunisian airport were still French. They were greatly displeased by our arrival and refused to issue us visas.

However, these police officers and officials were no longer the masters of Tunisia, and the era of their doing whatever they wanted was gone forever. Their impolite actions could only arouse the indignation of the Tunisian youth who had been waiting at the airport to welcome us. Under the protection of the Tunisian youth, we entered Tunisia.

### 突尼斯访问记

　　突尼斯访问记
　　李学纯
      （一）突尼斯和中国
    今年8月，我们应突尼斯全国学生联合会的邀请，作为新中国大学生的代表，访问了突尼斯。
    突尼斯是一个位于非洲北部的国家，全国有三百五十万人。它的一半的国境濒临地中海，全国到处长满了橄榄树和无花果，小麦产量丰富，是一个美丽而富饶的国家。但是，突尼斯人民在历史上遭受过罗马帝国、汪达尔、西罗马、土耳其和阿拉伯人的压迫；而近七十余年来，法帝国主义者的铁蹄又踩在突尼斯人民的头上。突尼斯人民一直过着极为悲惨的生活。到今年3月20日，在经过了长期的反殖民主义斗争后，突尼斯人民终于获得了民族独立。
    在很古的时候，中国人和突尼斯人就有过友好来往。公元802年，中国的商人把茶叶、蚕丝、陶器和橘子带给了突尼斯，中国的造纸术也传到了突尼斯；那时，突尼斯人也来过中国。但是，近百年来，由于殖民主义者的阻挠，中、突两国人民之间的友好往来被隔绝了。因此我们还是近百年来第一次访问突尼斯的中国人。
    随着亚非地区民族解放运动的高涨，特别是由于中国人民革命斗争的胜利和突尼斯人民已获得民族独立，中、突两国人民之间的友谊将进入新的一页。
    （二）在巴黎飞机场上
    7月15日早上7点20分，我们乘飞机离开北京机场，途经乌兰巴托、莫斯科、华沙、布拉格，于7月30日下午两点钟，到达了巴黎机场。
    我们是从人民民主国家来的旅客，因此，和一般旅客不一样，接待我们的是三名便衣警察。
    “你们到哪里去？”
    “突尼斯。”
    “有法国的签证吗？”
    “没有，我们是应突尼斯学联的邀请到突尼斯去的。”
    “你们有突尼斯的入境签证吗？”
    “突尼斯学联有电报保证在突尼斯机场给我们签证。”
    “没有目的地的签证，不能在巴黎机场停留。”
    为了马上得到突尼斯的签证，我们打电话给突尼斯驻巴黎大使馆。这时已是八点钟了。但是，突尼斯驻巴黎大使仍亲自拿了签证来到机场，想立即把签证交给我们。不能容忍的现象发生了：巴黎警察不准突尼斯大使和我们见面，也不准把签证转交给我们。
    机场的警察竟然对我们说出了这样的话：“如果你们想到突尼斯去，必须有法国的签证，因为突尼斯是法国的一个省份”。看来，法国的某些人还不愿意承认这样一个事实：突尼斯人民已经在今年3月20日摆脱了法国七十年来的殖民统治而获得独立了。
    之后，我们被命令不准离开机场，等候答复。
    我们不得不在巴黎机场的沙发上过了一夜；第二天早饭后，警察通知我们说：“你们回布拉格的飞机票已经订好了，飞机马上起飞。”
    由于法国的阻挠，我们已经赶不上参加8月1日至3日举行的突尼斯学生代表大会了。但是，帝国主义者阻止不了中突两国人民的友好往来。我们绕道罗马、开罗终于在8月6日和突尼斯人民见面了。
      （三）到达突尼斯
    8月6日下午4点半，我们所乘的飞机进入了突尼斯国土，碧绿色的地中海，弯弯曲曲的海岸，座落在绿色的橄榄树丛中的白色圆顶的清真寺，秀丽的突尼斯大地映入了我们的眼帘。
      下午五点钟，飞机降落在突尼斯机场上。在机场上欢迎我们的是热情的、朝气勃勃的青年。
    由于突尼斯获得独立还不到五个月，一些交接手续还未完成，突尼斯飞机场上的警察和官吏大部分还是法国人。他们对我们的来临大感不快，拒绝发给我们签证。
    但是，这些警察和官吏已经不是突尼斯的主人，他们为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。他们的这种无礼行动只能激起早就候在机场欢迎我们的突尼斯青年的愤慨。我们在突尼斯青年的卫护下进入了突尼斯。　　　　　　　（未完）（附图片）
