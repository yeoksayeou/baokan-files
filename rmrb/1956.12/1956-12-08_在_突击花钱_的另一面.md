　　On the Other Side of "Rushing to Spend Money"
　　　　　　　　　　(I)
　　After reading "A Purchasing Agent's Words" and "A Message to Those Who Rush to Spend Money" on page 3 of the People's Daily on November 30, I have some thoughts. I think: "Those who rush to spend money" waste the country's resources and should indeed be criticized. However, if everyone who spends money at the end of the year is uniformly convicted of "rushing to spend money," it is inevitable that some good people will be wronged. The second and third types of "money spenders" mentioned in "A Purchasing Agent's Words" should be judged as "those who rush to spend money" and sanctioned. The first type of money spender should not be entirely judged as "those who rush to spend money." Because there are indeed some things that need to be bought. If they are not bought by the end of the year, it will be difficult to create a budget next year. Sometimes, not only will it not be approved, but you may even get criticized. There are indeed many such examples. Therefore, I believe that this kind of "rushing to spend money" should not be entirely blamed on the "money spenders." Those who force the "money spenders" to "rush" should also bear some responsibility.
　　When some units compile their budgets, they adopt an attitude of "ask for three parts profit, it's enough even if you don't give it all," not starting from reality, trying to ask for more. It's good if the higher-ups approve it; if they don't approve it all, "we won't buy grain, but we won't lose the bag either." Why is this? It cannot be entirely blamed on the lower levels. Some higher-level organs are also responsible. They don't ask about the situation below and don't start from reality to solve practical problems when dealing with lower-level budgets. Instead, they cut everything by tens of percent. Some lower-level organs suffer greatly because of this, so they have to ask for more in preparation for the higher-level cuts. In this way, they influence each other and develop a false and unrealistic style, causing many unnecessary troubles and difficulties for the work.
　　If we want to prevent the phenomenon of "rushing to spend money" from recurring, both higher and lower levels should start from reality.

　　　　　　　　　　(II)
　　After reading "A Purchasing Agent's Words" and "Editorial Postscript to 'A Message to Those Who Rush to Spend Money'" in the reader's letters column on page 3 of the People's Daily on November 30, I was reminded of a puzzling question. Why is this behavior, which everyone recognizes as wrong, happening again this year, after happening the year before last and last year? Of course, the idea of departmentalism, disregarding the overall situation and only caring about small collectives, exists among the leaders and staff of many units. However, is it true that the leading comrades of all units that "rush to spend money" at the end of the year have lost their conscience? This is worth studying. In the past, there was such a phenomenon: after some units turned in the money they couldn't spend, not only did they not receive encouragement, but the next year's budget was not approved in full, causing the unit to have difficulties with insufficient funds. Who should be criticized for this? It is precisely because some people who hold the power to approve budgets do not verify lower-level financial budgets realistically, that the units applying for budgets have to "go against their conscience" to "rush to spend money." Shouldn't this subjective style of the budget approving organs also be criticized?

### 在“突击花钱”的另一面

　  在“突击花钱”的另一面
                    （一）
    读了11月30日人民日报第三版“一个采购员的话”和“告突击花钱者”以后，我有一点感想。我认为：“突击花钱者”浪费了国家的资财，确实应当批评。但是，凡是年终花钱者都一律被判以“突击花钱者”的罪名，也难免会冤枉一些好人。“一个采购员的话”提到的三种“花钱者”，第二、三种应判决为“突击花钱者”，予以制裁。第一种花钱者不应全部判决为“突击花钱者”。因为的确有些需要的东西，年底不买妥，明年再造预算有困难，有时不但批不准，反而还要吃一顿批评，这样的例子也确实不少。所以我认为这样“突击花钱”，不应完全归罪于“花钱者”，逼使“花钱者”非“突击”不行的人也应负一部分责任。
    有些单位在编造预算的时候，抱着“张口三分利，不给也够本”的态度，不从实际出发，企图多造一些，上级能批准正好，不全部批准，“买不着粮，也丢不了口袋”。为什么这样呢？也不能完全归罪于下级，某些上级机关也有责任，他们不问下情，对待下级的预算，也不从实际出发，解决实际问题，而是一律削减百分之几十；有些下级机关因此大吃其苦头，于是不得不多造一些，准备上级削减。就这样，互相影响，养成虚而不实的作风，给工作造成许多不应有的麻烦和困难。
    要想不让“突击花钱”现象再生，上下级都应该从实际出发。

                （二）
    读了人民日报11月30日第三版读者来信中“一个采购员的话”和“告突击花钱者”的“编后随笔”以后，我想起一个令人难解的问题。为什么这种大家都公认为不对的行为，前年有过，去年有过，今年又有了呢？当然，不顾大局，只顾小集体的本位主义的思想，在不少单位的领导者和工作人员中是存在着的，但是，是不是所有年终“突击花钱”的单位的领导同志都黑了良心呢？这是值得研究的。过去就有这样的现象：有的单位把用不完的钱缴上去后，不但得不到鼓励，而且第二年的预算就得不到如数批准，致使这个单位发生了开支不足的困难。这应该批评谁呢？正是因为掌握批准预算大权的某些人不实事求是地核准下级财务预算，申报预算的单位就不得不“瞒着良心”去“突击用钱”。审批预算的机关的这种主观主义的作风，难道不也应该给予批评吗？
