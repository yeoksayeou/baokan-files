In the Chiang Kai-shek Army

    Suicide and Desertion
    In the Chiang Kai-shek army, 60% were mainlanders, and the remaining 40% were Taiwanese soldiers conscripted since 1954. In the first two years after arriving in Taiwan, desertion was rampant, but those who were caught were either shot or buried alive. After the American occupation of Taiwan, the secret service control in the army was strengthened. Anyone who was slightly careless in their words or actions was immediately taken for a "talk" and "disappeared" without even having time to say goodbye to their colleagues. Under violent suppression, they勉强忍耐着, pinned their hopes on Chiang Kai-shek's "counter-attack on the mainland"; they were waiting for that opportunity to escape back home. However, one year, two years passed, Chiang Kai-shek's words proved false, and some people became so disheartened that they committed suicide. In my regiment, two officers and several soldiers died in this way. Most of the officers and soldiers were very homesick. A soldier named Chen became mentally ill because he missed his home too much. Chiang Kai-shek discovered this serious situation and took several measures: such as "preventing the suicide and desertion competition movement," "strengthening ideological education to improve the awareness of officers and soldiers," and "establishing military pleasure gardens (brothels)," etc. But none of these could stop the discontent of the officers and soldiers, and suicide and desertion continued to occur.

    The Soldiers' "Liver Fire"
    Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers generally became "liver fire旺盛" because they were subjected to long-term abuse and beatings from officers. Soldiers arguing back to officers was a common phenomenon in almost every company. Incidents of "opposing superiors" and "disobeying orders" often occurred. Last year, in the demonstration teaching camp of the Taiwan Infantry School, two soldiers shot and killed two platoon leaders and one squad leader with submachine guns, and then deserted with their weapons. One of my classmates, who was a platoon leader in the 32nd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, was also shot and killed by soldiers. The higher authorities took extremely severe punishment for such incidents. Those who shot people were sentenced to death, and those who opposed superiors or disobeyed orders were usually sentenced to five to seven years in prison. Even so, I still saw many such cases in the military law trial documents issued by the "Army Headquarters" every month.

    Soldier Riot in Nantou County
    Among the mainland soldiers in the Chiang Kai-shek army, many were young students who had been deceived. They were even more dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek and had a higher spirit of resistance. At the end of 1954, a battalion of soldiers in Nantou County, Taiwan, rose up in riot. They used to be students from Shandong Province on the mainland. When the area where their schools were located was about to be liberated, Chiang Kai-shek's henchmen used the good name of further education to deceive them into going to Taiwan. After arriving in Taiwan, the swindlers pointed machine guns at them and forced them to become soldiers. The deceived students could no longer bear it, so they sent representatives to petition Chiang Kai-shek, demanding to resume their studies. The result was still that they had to continue to be soldiers and wait for the "counter-attack on the mainland." They were extremely angry and went up the mountain en masse with their guns. They hoped to use this desperate method to solve the problem of resuming their studies. But Chiang Kai-shek sent two regiments to surround them, with artillery set up all around. Under the threat of artillery fire and deception, this battalion of people was forced to surrender their weapons. Those who were considered ringleaders were brutally shot, and the rest were assigned to various companies in groups of two or three. Three were assigned to my company, but two of them ran away in less than half a month.

    Taiwanese Soldiers Are Not Fooled Either
    A Taiwanese soldier's monthly salary was fifteen Taiwan dollars (equivalent to two yuan in Renminbi), which was not even enough to buy daily necessities. Many people had to have money sent from home to subsidize them. From the day they joined the army, they calculated the time of their discharge day by day. They believed that every day that passed was one day less of suffering. They were unwilling to fight and hoped to return home safely.

    In May of this year, I saw two work instructions issued by the puppet Ministry of National Defense, requiring the troops to use strengthened ideological education, more "spiritual talks," and individual transformation methods to correct the "erroneous thinking" of Taiwanese soldiers who were uneasy, afraid of hardship, and believed that the "counter-attack on the mainland" had nothing to do with them. However, these methods of Chiang Kai-shek did not produce any effect.

    The Officers' Worries
    Soldiers were depressed, and officers were also full of worries, fretting about their future every day. Many officers believed that they were not leading soldiers, but a group of tigers, and were always worried that they would be devoured by the tigers. The phrase "life imprisonment" has become the officers' catchphrase when they talk and complain. The average officer was already in his thirties or forties, but very few had wives. "There is no future, so you have to have a family," many officers wanted to get married, but it was indeed not easy to find a wife in Taiwan. It was not only difficult to find a partner, but it was even more difficult to support her. In order to deceive the officers, Chiang Kai-shek issued an order in June of last year: "Those who have performed three great merits will be given a wife by the government." At that time, I was receiving training at the Infantry School, and the students were all field-grade and company-grade officers. Everyone was very angry when they heard this order. An older officer said: "I have worked for one or two decades, shed blood, and been wounded. Not to mention three great merits, I haven't even been credited with one."

    The motherland's great call for striving for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan is in line with the common aspirations of officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Taiwan. I believe that they will respond to this call and work for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan.

    在蒋军部队里
    聂智威
    自杀和逃亡
    在蒋军部队里，有60％是大陆人，其余40％是从1954年开始征集的台籍士兵。初到台湾的两年当中开小差的风气很盛，但被抓回来的不是枪毙，就是活埋。美国侵占台湾以后，部队里加强特务控制，言行稍有疏忽的人，立刻被找去“谈话”，连向同事告别的时间都没有就“失踪”了。在暴力的镇压下，他们勉强忍耐着，把希望寄托在蒋介石“反攻大陆”上；他们等待着那个机会逃回家去。但是，一年两年过去了，蒋介石的话失灵了，于是有些人灰心丧气得自杀了。我所在的团有两位军官和几个战士就是这样死去的。大部分官兵，都非常思念家乡。有一位姓陈的士兵，因想家过度，得了神经病。蒋介石发现了这种严重情况，就采取了几项措施：如“防止自杀逃亡竞赛运动”，“加强思想教育，提高官兵认识”，“设立军乐园（妓女院）”等。但是这些都不能制止官兵们的不满，自杀和逃亡照样发生。
    士兵们的“肝火”
    蒋军士兵因长期受军官的虐待和打骂，一般都变得“肝火旺盛”。士兵同军官顶嘴，几乎是每个连队的普遍现象。“反上”、“不服从命令”的事件常常发生。去年，在台湾步兵学校示范教导营里，就有两位士兵拿冲锋枪打死了两个排长，一个班长，然后带枪开了小差。我的一位同学，在蒋军三十二师当排长，也是被士兵用枪打死的。上级对这类事件采取了极其严厉的惩罚，枪杀人的判死罪，反上、不服从命令的，通常也要判五至七年的徒刑。虽然如此，但是，我在每月“陆总”发下的军法审判文件中，仍然看到有不少这样的案件。
    南投县的士兵暴动
    蒋军部队大陆籍的士兵中，有许多是被骗去的青年学生。他们对蒋介石更是不满，反抗情绪更高。1954年底，在台湾南投县有一个营的士兵起来暴动。他们过去在大陆上都是山东省的学生，当学校所在地区快要解放的时候，蒋介石的爪牙用升学的美名，把他们欺骗到了台湾。到台湾以后，骗子们就用机枪对着他们，强迫着他们当了兵。受骗的学生忍无可忍，就派代表向蒋介石请愿，要求复学。结果仍然是要他们继续当兵，等待“反攻大陆”。他们气愤极了，一窝蜂似地连人带枪上了山。他们希望用这种不得已的办法，以求解决复学问题。但蒋介石派了两个团将他们包围起来，四周架起大炮。在炮火威胁和欺骗之下，这一营人被迫缴了械。被认为是首脑分子的惨遭枪杀，其余三三两两地被分别编入各连队。我连编进了三名，但不到半个月就跑掉了两名。
    台籍士兵也不受骗
    一个台籍士兵，每月薪饷台币十五元（折合人民币二元），连买日用品都不够，很多人都是由家中寄钱补贴。他们从入营那天起，就逐天计算退伍的时间，他们认为，过一天便减少一天痛苦。他们都不愿意打仗，希望能安全地回到家里。
    今年5月里，我看到伪国防部发下两份工作指示，要部队用加强思想教育，多做“精神讲话”和进行个别改造的办法，纠正台籍士兵不安心，怕吃苦和认为“反攻大陆”跟自己没有关系的“错误思想”。但是，蒋介石的这些办法，都没有产生任何效果。
    军官的苦恼
    士兵苦闷，军官也是烦恼重重，天天为前途发愁。许多军官认为他们带的不是兵，而是一群老虎，时刻耽心自己会被虎吞吃掉。“无期徒刑”这句话，已经成了军官们谈话和发牢骚时的口头禅了。一般军官的年龄都已经三、四十岁了，可是有妻子的却很少。“没有前途，总得有个家呀”，很多军官都想讨老婆，但是，在台湾找老婆确实不容易，不仅难找到对象，更困难的是无法养活。蒋介石为了欺骗军官，在去年6月份发下了一个命令：“凡立三个大功者，由政府配给老婆”。当时，我正在步兵学校受训，学员都是校、尉级军官，大家听到这个命令都很气愤。有一位年岁大的军官说：“我干了一、二十年，流过血，负过伤，莫说三个大功，就连一个大功也没记过。”
    祖国提出了争取和平解放台湾的伟大号召，是符合台湾蒋军官、士兵的共同愿望的，我相信他们一定要响应这一号召，为和平解放台湾而努力。
