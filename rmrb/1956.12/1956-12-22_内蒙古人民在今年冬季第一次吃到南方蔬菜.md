Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 21st - For the first time this winter, workers and residents in cities and forestry areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are eating fresh vegetables transported from the south. Since the end of November, more than 110,000 jin of various vegetables such as eggplant, cucumber, cowpea, tomatoes, and peppers have been transported from Guangzhou. These vegetables are specifically supplied to cities such as Hohhot, Baotou, Manzhouli, and Hailar, as well as the needs of the Greater Khingan Range forestry area. The price of vegetables is very cheap, generally half the price of locally produced vegetables, and in some cases 60% to 70% lower, so they are very popular among consumers.

In previous years, the fresh vegetables consumed in Hohhot in winter were mainly supplied by Beijing and other places, with a small number produced by greenhouses in the suburbs of Hohhot. However, the quantity was small, the price was very expensive, and a regular supply could not be guaranteed. This year, according to the China Vegetable Company's decision to transport vegetables from the south to the north, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Vegetable Sundries Company signed a contract with Guangdong's commercial departments to purchase 630,000 jin of vegetables. During the journey from Guangzhou to Inner Mongolia, the transportation departments promptly switched to refrigerated or insulated carriages according to the changes in climate, and strengthened inspections during the journey. Therefore, the vegetables transported always remained tender, green, and fresh.

    内蒙古人民在今年冬季第一次吃到南方蔬菜
    新华社呼和浩特21日电　内蒙古自治区各城市、林区的职工和市民，今年冬季第一次吃到了南方运来的新鲜蔬菜。从11月底到现在，从广州运来的茄子、黄瓜、豆角、西红柿和辣椒等各种蔬菜已经有十一万多斤，这些蔬菜是专门供应呼和浩特、包头、满洲里和海拉尔等城市及大兴安岭林区的需要的。菜价非常便宜，一般都比当地出产的蔬菜价格低二分之一，有些低60％到70％，因此受到了广大消费者的欢迎。
    往年呼和浩特市冬天吃的新鲜蔬菜，主要由北京等地供应，少数由呼和浩特市郊区温室生产，但是数量很少，价钱也很贵，并且不能保证经常供应。今年内蒙古自治区蔬菜杂品公司根据中国蔬菜公司的南菜北运的决定，同广东省商业部门签订了购买六十三万斤蔬菜的合同。在由广州运到内蒙古的途中，负责运输的部门根据气候的变化及时换用冷藏车或保温车厢装运，并且加强了运途中的检查工作。因此，运来的蔬菜始终保持嫩绿、新鲜。
