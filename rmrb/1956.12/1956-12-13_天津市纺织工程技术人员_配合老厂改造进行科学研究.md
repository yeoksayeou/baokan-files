Xinhua News Agency report: Tianjin, December 12th—Over two hundred textile engineering technicians in Tianjin are systematically conducting scientific research on 113 new technologies and processes. The eight professional research groups, established to solve production problems and cooperate with the renovation of old factories, not only carry out specialized scientific research, but also frequently discuss and exchange experiences in various aspects, and invite experts and professors to give academic reports. Many research projects have achieved preliminary results.

The engineering technicians are trying their best to study and adopt methods that do not cost much money to improve the equipment conditions of the factories. For example, the "control roller" added to the carding machine researched by the steel wire professional research group is made of materials such as saw blades. After preliminary tests, it can reduce neps by 30% to 50%.

The technical measures developed by the roving and spinning professional research group, such as using artificial rubber cots instead of cowhide cots and adopting thin spindle tapes, are of great value in saving cowhide and electricity. The recent research by the scutcher professional research group on using comb beaters on old cotton openers produces cotton laps that are flatter and more uniform than those produced by old-fashioned blade three-wing beaters.

    天津市纺织工程技术人员
    配合老厂改造进行科学研究
    据新华社讯　天津市二百多名纺织工程技术人员正在有计划地进行一百一十三项新技术、新工艺的科学研究。他们为解决生产中的问题和配合老厂改造而成立的八个专业研究组，除进行专题的科学研究外，还经常讨论和交流各方面的经验，邀请专家、教授等做学术报告。许多研究项目已获得初步成果。
    工程技术人员们尽量研究采取花钱不多的办法来改进工厂的设备条件。例如钢丝专业研究组研究的在梳棉机上加装“控制罗拉”，就是用锯条等材料制成的。经初步试验，它可以降低棉结30％到50％。
    并粗细专业研究组研究出的用人造橡胶皮辊代替牛皮辊和采用薄绽带等技术措施，在节约牛皮和节约用电方面都有很大的价值。清花专业研究组最近研究的在老的清棉机上采用梳针打手，比用老式刀片三翼打手打出的棉卷平整、均匀。
