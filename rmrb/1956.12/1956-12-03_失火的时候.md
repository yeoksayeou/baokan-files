    During the Fire
    Next to the house of Liang Luobao (poor peasant), the small队长 [team leader] of the Zhuzikeng Agricultural Cooperative in Leijiadong Township, Daoxian County, Hunan, was the cooperative's warehouse. The warehouse was filled with farm tools and office supplies. On September 17th, just as the cooperative was expanding and upgrading, a counter-revolutionary element set fire to Liang Xiaobao's house, attempting to spread the fire to the warehouse in order to sabotage the cooperative's expansion and upgrade efforts.
    Although Liang Luobao was anxious seeing his house engulfed in flames, he thought: the warehouse contains more things, and it belongs to the cooperative; my house contains fewer things, and they are personal. When he thought of this, he disregarded his own safety and rushed to rescue the cooperative's warehouse. Inspired by him, the cooperative members actively joined the rescue efforts. As a result, the cooperative's warehouse suffered no damage, but Liang Luobao's house was burned down.
    When people asked him why he acted this way, he said, "The cooperative is my home; without the cooperative, there is no home." Liang Luobao's selfless act was commended in a government notice and praised by the cooperative members. They said, "Luobao truly loves the cooperative more than his own home."
    To compensate Liang Luobao for his loss, in addition to the 70 yuan relief fund issued by the government, the cooperative also subsidized him with 500 jin of rice from the public welfare fund and is preparing to repair his house.

    失火的时候
    湖南道县雷家洞乡侏仔圹农业社小队长梁洛宝（贫农）的房子的隔壁，是社里的仓库。仓库里堆放着很多农具和办公用品。就在9月17日这一天，正当合作社进行扩社升级工作时，反革命分子在梁小宝的房内放了一把火，企图把火引向仓库，来破坏合作社的扩社升级工作。
    梁洛宝虽眼看着自己的房子火焰冲天，有些着急；但他想的却是：仓库里放的东西多，又是社里的；自己的房里放的东西少，而且是个人的。当他想到这里，就不顾自己的一切，急忙奔去抢救社里的仓库了。在他的带动下，社员们也都积极参加抢救。结果是：社里的仓库没有受到半点损失，可是梁洛宝的房子却被烧掉了。
    人们问到他为什么这样作，他说：“社就是自己的家，没有社就没有家。”梁洛宝这种舍己为公的行动，受到政府的通报表扬，得到了社员们的同声赞扬。他们说：“洛宝真是爱社胜似爱家。”
    为了弥补梁洛宝的损失，除由政府发给他七十元救济款外，社里还从公益金中补助了他五百斤稻谷，并准备为他修复房屋。
