　　Boxing, Fencing, and Gymnastics
　　Demonstration Tournament Opens in Beijing Yesterday

    (Our newspaper reports) The 1956 National Boxing, Fencing, and Gymnastics Demonstration Tournament opened yesterday (2nd) afternoon at the Beijing Gymnasium.

    More than 140 male and female athletes from sixteen provinces and cities participated in this demonstration tournament. Huang Qixiang, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, spoke at the opening ceremony.

    After the opening ceremony, five boxing preliminary matches in the flyweight, featherweight, lightweight, and light middleweight divisions, as well as two exhibition matches, were held.

    In the two flyweight matches, Wang Shouxin (Beijing), the 1953 national ethnic sports performance and competition champion in the flyweight boxing division, defeated Bai Wenjun (Chengdu). Huang Wenhao, an athlete from Yunnan Province, defeated Wu Huping from Wuhan in two and a half rounds.

    The featherweight match was between Huang Shoukang (Beijing) and Fang Yehuan (Shenyang). Fang Yehuan competed in a higher weight class and lost due to slightly inferior physical strength.

    Sun Jizhu, a Korean athlete from Heilongjiang Province who won the light middleweight title at the 1953 National Ethnic Sports Performance and Competition Tournament, participated in the lightweight division this time because of weight loss. He defeated Zheng Jifang, an athlete from Xi'an.

    Light middleweight athlete Wang Guojun (Beijing) defeated Chen Guoqiang (Wuhan).

    Also, in the boxing matches that continued last night (2nd), Ye Bao? , a junior bantamweight athlete from Tianjin, defeated Tan Zhenhong from Guangzhou. They are both nineteen-year-old young athletes weighing no more than 51 kilograms.

    In the second and third featherweight matches, Ma Jingyi (Xi'an) and Xu Liansheng (Shanghai) defeated Hou Hanrong (Guangzhou) and Chen Weigang, respectively.

    In the last three lightweight matches, Chen Xinhua (Beijing), Li Guohua (Xi'an), and Yu Hanqiang (Wuhan) successively defeated Zheng Mutong (Wuhan), Xu Xingnan (Fujian), and Li Jiahai (Tianjin). Chen Xinhua was the lightweight boxing champion at the 1953 National Ethnic Sports Performance and Competition Tournament. Zheng Mutong was clearly at a disadvantage technically in the match against him, so he voluntarily withdrew in the third round.

    There was also an exhibition match after the competition.

　　拳击、击剑、技巧运动
　　表演赛昨天在京开幕
    本报讯　1956年全国拳击、击剑、技巧运动表演赛昨天（2日）下午在北京市体育馆举行开幕式。
    参加这次表演赛的有来自十六个省、市的一百四十多名男、女运动员。中央体育运动委员会副主任黄琪翔在开幕式上讲了话。
    开幕式后，还举行了最轻级、次轻量级、轻量级和轻中级的五场拳击预赛和两场表演比赛。
    在两场最轻级比赛中，1953年全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会最轻级拳击冠军王守忻（北京）战胜了白文君（成都）。云南省的运动员黄文豪在两回合半中就击败了武汉市的伍湖平。
    次轻量级比赛是黄寿康（北京）对方业焕（沈阳），方业焕是越级参加比赛的，由于体力稍逊一着而失败。
    1953年全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会轻中级冠军获得者、黑龙江省朝鲜族运动员孙吉柱，因为体重减轻这次参加了轻量级比赛。他战胜了西安市运动员郑季芳。
    轻中级运动员王国钧（北京）击败了陈国强（武汉）。
    又讯　在昨天（2日）晚间继续进行的拳击比赛中，天津市次最轻级运动员业宝?击败了广州市谭镇鸿。他们都是体重不超过五十一公斤的十九岁的年轻运动员。
    第二场和第三场次轻量级比赛，马靖夷（西安）和许连生（上海）分别战胜侯汉荣（广州）和陈伟刚。
    在轻量级的最后三场比赛中，陈新华（北京）、李国华（西安）和余汉强（武汉）先后战胜郑木通
  （武汉）、许幸男（福建）和李家海（天津）。陈新华是1953年全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会轻量级拳击冠军，郑木通同他比赛，在技术上显然处于劣势，因此第三回合便自动弃权了。
    比赛完了还有一场表演赛。
