Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, December 30th: After two weeks of negotiations between the Chinese and Ceylonese government delegations, a trade agreement has been reached. On the afternoon of December 29th, the two parties signed three relevant documents at the Ceylonese Prime Minister's residence.

The agreements reached include: an exchange of notes to extend the trade agreement between the two countries to the end of 1957; a contract for the Chinese government to purchase 50,000 metric tons of rubber from the Ceylonese government in 1957, and a contract for the Ceylonese government to purchase 270,000 metric tons of rice from the Chinese government.

Ye Jizhuang, head of the Chinese government trade delegation and Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China, signed the three documents on behalf of the Chinese government. C.P. de Silva, Minister of Commerce and Trade of Ceylon, signed the exchange of notes extending the agreement and the rubber contract on behalf of the Ceylonese government; and Henry Abeywickrama, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Cooperative Development of Ceylon, signed the rice contract. Ceylonese Prime Minister Bandaranaike attended the signing ceremony.

After the signing, the two parties jointly held a press conference and distributed a joint press release.

The Chinese government trade delegation held a farewell reception on the evening of the 29th. About two hundred people attended the reception, including the Ceylonese Prime Minister, cabinet ministers, members of parliament, and foreign diplomatic envoys to Ceylon. Delegation head Ye Jizhuang and Prime Minister Bandaranaike delivered speeches at the reception.

Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, December 30th: The government trade delegations of China and Ceylon issued a joint communiqué to the press on the 29th after signing three documents regarding the trade agreement between the two countries, stating that the 1957 rice and rubber contracts were concluded in accordance with the five-year agreement signed in 1952, and are in line with the spirit and letter of that agreement. The arrangements made in the past have increased the interests of the two countries, and the currently signed contracts will extend these benefits for another year. The joint communiqué stated that China has obtained a guaranteed supply of rubber, and Ceylon has obtained a guaranteed supply of rice, and has ensured that its rubber will receive a stable price higher than the general price in Singapore for four years. This premium enables Ceylon to carry out the restoration of the Ceylonese rubber industry, which has been severely damaged by the devastating cutting during the war. The rubber purchase contract now signed, which continues to provide premiums, will enable the restoration work to be further expanded.

Both parties hope that the rubber-rice trade and trade in other commodities between the two countries will continue unabated even after the five-year agreement on the purchase of rubber and rice expires at the end of 1957. The two governments are confident that this agreement has been implemented not only in the letter but also in the spirit, benefiting both China and Ceylon; the two governments also believe that the future relations between the two countries will continue to be built on the same basis of mutual benefit.

The joint communiqué also stated that the trade delegation of the People's Republic of China has exchanged views with Ceylonese commercial organizations on the issue of Chinese goods needed by Ceylon. The Chinese government trade delegation also discussed with the Ceylonese government trade delegation ways to increase trade between the two countries based on the policies of the two governments. The government representatives of the two countries also had beneficial discussions on the issue of technical assistance.

    中锡两国贸易谈判达成协议
    我国将向锡兰输出大米并购买锡兰的橡胶
    新华社30日讯　科伦坡消息：中锡贸易谈判经过两国政府代表团两个星期的商谈已经达成协议。12 月29日下午，中锡双方在锡兰总理官邸签订了有关的三项文件。
    双方达成的协议包括：再度延长两国贸易协定到1957年年底的换文；关于1957年中国政府向锡兰政府购买橡胶五万公吨的合同和锡兰政府向中国政府购买大米二十七万公吨的合同。
    代表中国政府在三项文件上签字的是中国政府贸易代表团团长、中华人民共和国对外贸易部长叶季壮。代表锡兰政府在延长协定换文和橡胶合同上签字的是锡兰商业和贸易部部长沈纳那亚克；在大米合同上签字的是锡兰农业、粮食和合作发展部部长古纳瓦地尼。锡兰总理班达拉奈克出席了签字仪式。
    签字后，双方曾经联合举行记者招待会并散发了联合新闻公报。
    中国政府贸易代表团在29日晚举行了临别招待会。出席招待会的有锡兰总理，内阁部长，国会议员，外国驻锡兰外交使节等约二百人。叶季壮团长和班达拉奈克总理在会上相互致词。
    新华社30日讯　科伦坡消息：中国和锡兰两国的政府贸易代表团29日在签订关于两国贸易协议的三项文件以后向报界发表了一项联合公报说，1957年的大米和橡胶合同是按照在1952年签订的五年协定缔结的，并且是符合这个协定的精神和文字的。过去所作的安排已经增进了两国的利益，目前签订的合同将使这些利益再延长一年。联合公报说，中国得到了有保证的橡胶供应，锡兰则得到了有保证的大米供应，并且使得它的橡胶四年来保证能够得到高出新加坡一般价格的稳定的价格。这项贴水使得锡兰能够对由于战时进行毁灭性切割而遭到严重破坏的锡兰橡胶业进行恢复工作。现在所签订的这项继续给予贴水的购买橡胶的合同将使恢复工作能够进一步扩大进行。
    双方希望，两国之间的橡胶大米贸易和其他商品的贸易即使在关于购买橡胶大米的五年协定在1957年底满期以后仍应毫不缩减地继续进行。两国政府确信，这项协定不仅在文字上执行了，而且在精神上也执行了，使中国和锡兰都得到好处；两国政府并且相信两国将来的关系也将继续建立在同样的互利的基础之上。
    联合公报又说，中华人民共和国政府贸易代表团已经同锡兰商业组织就锡兰所需要的中国商品问题交换过意见。中国政府贸易代表团还同锡兰政府贸易代表团讨论了根据两国政府的政策增加两国贸易的办法。两国政府代表还就技术援助问题进行了有益的讨论。
