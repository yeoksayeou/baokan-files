　　Calculate the Big Account of Pig Raising and Manure Accumulation
　　Yao Huibin
    My country's chemical fertilizer industry is still very backward. The planned output of chemical fertilizers in 1957 is 578,000 tons. Although factories are being actively built to increase production, the plan is to produce 3 million to 3.2 million tons by 1962. However, calculated according to the national planting area, each mu (Chinese unit of measurement, 1 mu ≈ 0.16 acres) will still only receive less than three jin (Chinese unit of measurement, 1 jin ≈ 0.5 kg). It can be seen that chemical fertilizers not only cannot meet the needs of agricultural production at present, but also will not be able to do so for a considerable period of time. Therefore, for a considerable period of time, the basic way to solve the fertilizer problem can only be to rely on the broad masses of peasants to vigorously develop fertilizer sources and make full use of farm manure, especially pig raising and manure accumulation (in some areas, more cattle and sheep can be developed). There is a saying in rural China that "no pigs in the pen, no grain in the field," which shows how important pig raising and manure accumulation are to agricultural production increase. If pig raising is not rapidly and massively developed, the fertilizer supply will encounter huge difficulties in the next few years, and agricultural production increase will be greatly affected.
　  Experiments in Several Regions
    According to scientific analysis and the experience of farmers in several regions in raising pigs: raising a pig in a pen, from small to large (live weight of 150 jin), can generally accumulate 4,000 to 5,000 jin of pure manure. In some areas, bedding grass or soil is laid in the pigsty, so the amount of penned manure is even greater, generally each pig can accumulate 15 to 18 large carts of manure, each cart weighing about 1,700 to 2,000 jin. Then, what effect does the manure of a pig have on crop yields? Let's first look at the experiments in several regions:
    1. In 1955, Xinghua Agricultural Cooperative of Langwan Township, Yanggu County, Shandong Province, planted wheat. Two mu of land with the same soil quality were used, and the same cultivation methods were adopted. One mu was applied with four carts of pig manure, and 270 jin of wheat were harvested; the other mu was applied with six carts of pig manure, and 326 jin of wheat were harvested, 56 jin more than the former mu; on average, each cart of manure increased wheat production by 28 jin.
    2. In 1954, when the Shimen Song Township Agricultural Cooperative of Yanggu County, Shandong Province, planted corn, fourteen mu of land were randomly selected. Each mu was applied with fifteen large carts of pig manure (each cart weighing 1,700 jin). As a result, each mu produced 873 jin of corn. Other land with the same soil quality was only applied with five large carts of pig manure per mu, and each mu produced 495 jin of corn. The former produced 378 jin more per mu than the latter; on average, each cart of manure increased corn production by more than 37 jin and 12 liang (Chinese unit of measurement, 1 liang ≈ 50 grams).
    3. In 1956, the Xinqiao Agricultural Cooperative of Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, conducted an experiment on the fertilizer effect of pig manure: A. Six mu of rice paddies that had been planted with early rice last year were planted with early rice again this year, and the same amount of other fertilizers as last year (280 dan (Chinese unit of measurement for weight, 1 dan ≈ 50 kg) of natural fertilizer, 60 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 30 jin of pig manure) were applied as the base, and the same cultivation measures were taken. In addition, 15 dan of pig manure were applied. As a result, last year each mu produced 300 jin of rice, and this year each mu produced 423 jin. B. This year, the Sixth Brigade planted early rice in two groups of rice paddies with similar fertility (one group of 74 mu and one group of 92 mu). With the same cultivation techniques and the same amount of other fertilizers, the group of 74 mu was applied with 9 dan of pig manure per mu, and the average yield per mu was 480 jin; the group of 92 mu was applied with 5 dan of pig manure per mu, and the average yield per mu was 440 jin. On average, each additional dan of pig manure increased rice production by 10 jin.
    4. The experience of the masses in Shimen District, Changsha County, Hunan Province, is: if each mu of paddy field is applied with 7 dan of pig manure in addition to the original fertilizer, it can increase rice production by 100 jin, with an average of 14 jin of rice production increase per dan of pig manure.
    In addition, there are many other materials that also show that the penned manure accumulated by each pig from small to large can increase rice production by about 400 to 500 jin if applied to rice paddies; if used to grow corn, it can increase production by 500 jin to 600 jin; if used to grow wheat, it can also increase production by about 400 jin.
    Applying more pig manure can produce more grain because pig manure contains nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and many organic substances, which can not only supply the nutrients needed by crops, but also increase soil organic matter and cultivate soil fertility. Compared with various cake fertilizers and chemical fertilizers, the fertilizer effect of pig manure is not bad. Below are several comparisons of pig manure and other fertilizers in several places:
    In 1952, the Shimen Song Township Agricultural Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, used two mu of land with the same soil quality to compare the fertilizer effect of pig manure and soybean cake. One mu of land was planted with wheat and applied with five carts of pig manure, yielding 293 jin of wheat, which matured two days earlier; another mu of wheat was applied with 100 jin of soybean cake, yielding 290 jin of wheat, which was harvested two days later. After the wheat harvest, these two mu of land were still used to continue the experiment with corn and mung beans. The land that had been applied with pig manure was then applied with four carts of manure, resulting in a harvest of 285 jin of corn and 45 jin of mung beans; the land that had been applied with soybean cake was then applied with 80 jin of soybean cake, resulting in a harvest of 270 jin of corn and 30 jin of mung beans.
    In 1954, this cooperative conducted another comparison of the fertilizer effect of pig manure and fertilizer powder, using a total of four mu of land to grow millet. The soil quality and cultivation conditions were the same. Two mu were applied with seven carts of pig manure (four carts of base fertilizer and three carts of top dressing), and each mu yielded 670 jin of millet; the other two mu were applied with 45 jin of fertilizer powder (20 jin of base fertilizer and 25 jin of top dressing), and each mu yielded 487 jin of millet.
    In April 1954, the Xitang Agricultural Cooperative in Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, used two mu of paddy fields to sow mid-season rice and conducted a comparison of the fertilizer effect of pig manure and sesame cake. One mu was applied with 25 dan of pig manure, yielding 625 jin of rice; the other mu was applied with 36 jin of sesame cake, yielding 400 jin of rice.
    From these comparisons, it can be seen that the fertilizer effect of pig manure is very good, and the cost is relatively low. However, comparing all the pigs in the country with the area of cultivated land, each 16 or 17 mu of land only has one pig to supply fertilizer, which is far from meeting the needs of agricultural production. If calculated according to the fertilizer effect of each pig manure covering three mu of land, only 30,000 mu of land are fertilized, which is only equal to one-fifth of the existing cultivated land in the country, and four-fifths of the cultivated land does not have pig manure. Therefore, it is necessary to raise more pigs in order to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer in the longer term.
    Is it Cost-Effective?
    Raising more pigs requires more feed. Then, will it affect people's rations? This is a question that many people are very concerned about, and it is also related to whether or not we should massively develop pig raising.
    To clarify this issue, we must calculate two accounts: one is how much grain the manure of a pig can increase production, and the other is how much concentrated feed and green feed a pig needs to eat. The former account has already been mentioned above: it can generally increase grain production by 300 jin to 350 jin. Raising a pig from small to large (150 jin) requires about 200 jin to 300 jin of concentrated feed and 1,500 jin to 2,000 jin of green feed. If half or slightly more than half of the manure of a pig is used to increase the production of grain crops, it will be enough for the concentrated feed of a pig, and the remaining manure fertilizer can be used in half to increase the production of green feed, and part of the manure fertilizer can be used to increase the production of grain for human consumption. At the same time, the increase in pork, and people eating more meat, can also reduce grain consumption. Each pig can produce at least 10 jin of oil. With more pig raising and more pig oil, the planting area of oil crops can be reduced accordingly and used to grow grain crops instead. That is to say, if the country raises 10 million more fat pigs, in addition to the need to spend 2 billion to 3 billion jin of the original grain converted from the concentrated feed for pigs, it also needs 15 billion to 20 billion jin of green feed. If all these green feeds are planted on cultivated land, it will require about 2 million mu of cultivated land (the green feed required for each pig in the south is about one-tenth to one-tenth and a half of mu, which is enough, and it may be more in the north. The national average is calculated at two-tenths of mu per pig), which will reduce the planting area of grain by 2 million mu. However, each pig produces 10 jin of oil, which can reduce the consumption of vegetable oil. Generally, the oil of each pig can replace the vegetable oil produced by one-third of a mu of land. The oil of 10 million fat pigs can replace the vegetable oil produced by 3 million mu of land. Therefore, these 3 million mu of land can be used to grow grain instead, so planting green feed will not affect the grain planting area. The manure of 10 million fat pigs can increase grain production by 3 billion to 3.5 billion jin. In addition to the 2 billion to 3 billion jin of concentrated feed (converted to grain) eaten by these pigs, there can still be 1 billion to 1.5 billion jin left over. From this point of view, raising more pigs, accumulating more fertilizer, and producing more grain, and eating more lard and less vegetable oil, and less vegetable oil, can reduce the cultivated land to grow grain instead. This big account must be calculated and is cost-effective.
    It should be particularly pointed out that pig raising → manure accumulation → increased production, manure accumulation → increased production → pig raising, circulates repeatedly, and the decisive link is manure accumulation. Because even if more pigs are raised, if no attention is paid to manure accumulation, the purpose of increasing production cannot be achieved, and more pigs cannot be raised in the future. This will affect the smooth progress of this cycle. Only by paying attention to manure accumulation can we ensure increased production, so as to ensure that more pigs can be raised.
    How to Price Pig Manure
    In the past, farmers raised pigs mainly for the purpose of accumulating fertilizer, secondly for changing small money into whole money, and some also for eating meat. After agricultural cooperativization, the land was used uniformly by the agricultural cooperatives, and the purpose of farmers raising pigs has changed: most of the accumulated manure fertilizer is used by the cooperatives, and there is limited private land, and there is not much need for manure. This has led to a new problem of how the agricultural cooperatives should price the manure fertilizer accumulated by the members raising pigs.
    First of all, it should be affirmed that agricultural cooperatives should price and must price the manure fertilizer accumulated by the members raising pigs. If there is no price, it will affect the enthusiasm of the members to raise pigs and accumulate fertilizer.
    The pricing of manure fertilizer must be reasonable, taking into account both the interests of the cooperatives and the interests of the members. As for how much should be priced to be reasonable? This cannot be generalized and must be determined based on the amount of pig raising in various places, the methods of manure accumulation, the demand for manure fertilizer, the habit of farmers accumulating fertilizer, as well as the comparison of manure accumulation with other labor remuneration, and the comparison of the fertilizer effect of pig manure with other fertilizers. At present, some agricultural cooperatives determine the price based on the comparison of the effect of pig manure with soybean cake and chemical fertilizers; others calculate how much manure fertilizer each pig can accumulate from small to large, how much grain these manure fertilizers can increase production, and how much money they are worth, and then use a part of the increase in value as labor remuneration and another part as the price of pig manure. These methods are all feasible.
    As for the specific pricing methods, there are currently three main types used in various places: one is to price by head, that is, all the manure fertilizer of each pig is used by the cooperative, and the cooperative pays a certain price by head. Although this method is simple, the size of the pigs varies, and the quantity and quality of the accumulated manure fertilizer are also different, making it difficult to achieve fairness and rationality. Another method is to price by cart (or dan) according to quality, that is, to divide manure fertilizer into several grades, with high-quality and high prices, and low-quality and low prices. Northern provinces use carts, and southern regions use dan. The advantage of this pricing method is that it can implement high-quality and high prices, but the work of grading is not simple (some cooperatives specially organize evaluation groups, and some production teams democratically elect a few people to evaluate), the workload is large, and it is not easy to grasp the grading. Another method is to calculate the manure price in stages according to the size of the pig, the length of time it is raised, and the weight of the pig. For example, in Changli, Hebei: pigs weighing from 25 jin to 60 jin are given 1 jiao (Chinese monetary unit, 1 jiao ≈ 0.1 yuan) of manure money for each jin of growth, 1 jiao and 3 fen (Chinese monetary unit, 1 fen ≈ 0.01 yuan) per jin for 65 jin to 100 jin, and 1 jiao and 5 fen per jin for pigs weighing more than 100 jin. In Taixing, Jiangsu: 8 fen per jin for 15 jin to 40 jin, 1 jiao per jin for 41 jin to 70 jin, 1 jiao and 2 fen per jin for 71 jin to 100 jin, 1 jiao and 4 fen per jin for 101 jin to 150 jin, and 1 jiao and 5 and a half fen per jin for pigs weighing more than 150 jin. When the members sell the pigs, the weight is priced in stages according to the above regulations, and the settlement is done at one time. Changli County is responsible for the management of penned manure (pulling soil to pad the pen, picking up manure, etc.), and Taixing County is managed by the members (no need to pad soil). The advantage of this method is that high-quality and high prices can be implemented without grading. The above second and third methods are better; if the second method is adopted, attention must be paid to doing a good job in grading. No matter what pricing method is adopted, the principle of implementing high-quality and high prices must be implemented. If the penned manure is managed by the members themselves, the agricultural cooperatives must give the members time to pull soil to pad the pen, and care should be taken for members who lack labor. If the penned manure is managed by the cooperative, the agricultural cooperative should properly solve the problems of the fertilizer needed for the members' private land and the storage of scattered manure accumulated by the members (such as picked manure, accumulated ash and soil, and dirty soil, etc.).
    At present, there are still a considerable number of areas in my country where "people have no toilets and pigs have no pens," which causes many good fertilizers to be lost and wasted. Experiments on farms in Ningbo Prefecture, Zhejiang, have shown that scattering 96 pigs outside during the day can only accumulate more than 200 jin of manure per day; changing to raising pigs in pigsties can accumulate 1,032 jin of manure per day, an increase of four times. In areas where pig raising in the past did not pay attention to manure accumulation, the education of the masses should be strengthened, and the habit of scattering should be changed to increase the amount of manure accumulation.

　　算一算养猪积肥的大账
　　姚会宾
    我国目前的化学肥料工业还十分落后，1957年化学肥料的计划产量是五十七万八千吨，虽然积极建设工厂增加产量，到1962年计划生产三百至三百二十万吨，但是按全国播种面积计算，每亩还摊不到三斤。可见化学肥料不仅在目前而且在相当长的时期内也还远不能满足农业生产的需要。因此，在相当长的时期内，解决肥料问题的基本办法只能是依靠广大的农民群众大力开辟肥源，充分利用农家肥料，特别是养猪积肥（部分地区可以多发展牛羊）。我国农村有“栏内没有猪，田中不出谷”的农谚，可见养猪积肥对农业增产如何重要。如果不迅速地大量地发展养猪，在最近几年之内，肥料的供应将遇到巨大的困难，从而农业增产也将受到很大的影响。
　  几个地区的实验
    根据科学分析和若干地区农民养猪的经验：圈养一头猪，从小到大（活重一百五十斤）一般可积纯粪尿四千到五千斤。有的地区在猪圈内铺垫褥草或泥土，这样圈肥数量就更大，一般每头猪可积肥十五到十八大车，每车约一千七百至二千斤。那末，一头猪的粪尿对于农作物产量究竟有多大的作用呢？让我们先看看几个地区的实验吧：
    1．山东省阳谷县郎弯乡兴华农业社1955年种小麦，用同样土质的两亩地，采用同样耕作方法，一亩施猪厩肥四车，收小麦二百七十斤；另一亩施猪厩肥六车，收小麦三百二十六斤，比前一亩多收五十六斤；平均每车粪增产小麦二十八斤。
    2．山东省阳谷县石门宋乡农业社1954年种玉米时，任选十四亩地，每亩施猪厩肥十五大车（每车一千七百斤）结果每亩产玉米八百七十三斤；土质相同的其他土地每亩只施猪厩肥五大车，每亩产玉米四百九十五斤。前者比后者每亩多产三百七十八斤；平均每车粪增产玉米三十七斤十二两多。
    3．湖南省望城县心桥农业社1956年进行猪粪肥效的试验：甲、利用去年种早稻的六亩田今年再种早稻，仍施与去年同量的其他肥料
  （自然肥料二百八十担、硫酸錏六十斤，猪粪三十斤）为基础，并采取同样的栽培措施，另外增施了十五担猪粪，结果去年每亩产稻谷三百斤，今年每亩产四百二十三斤。乙、第六大队今年在肥沃程度相仿的两组（一组七十四亩、一组九十二亩）稻田里种早稻，同样栽培技术，其他肥料数量相同，对七十四亩的一组每亩施猪粪九担，每亩平均产量为四百八十斤；对九十二亩的一组每亩施猪粪五担，每亩平均产量为四百四十斤。平均每多施一担猪粪增产稻谷十斤。
    4．湖南省长沙县石门区群众的经验是：每亩水田除原有肥料外，如果再增施猪粪七担，可增产稻谷一百斤，平均每担猪粪增产十四斤。
    另外还有许多材料，也都说明：每一头猪从小到大所积的圈肥，施于稻田约可增产稻谷四百至五百斤；如果用来种玉米，则可增产五百斤至六百斤；如果用于种小麦也可增产四百斤左右。
    多施猪粪就能多产粮食，因为猪粪尿含有氮、磷、钾，还含有许多有机质，不但可以供给庄稼需要的养料，而且能增加土壤有机质，培养地力。与各种饼肥和化学肥料比起来，猪粪尿的肥效并不差。下面是几个地方用猪粪尿和其他肥料的对比：
    山东阳谷县石门宋乡农业社1952年用同样土质的两亩地进行猪粪与豆饼的肥效对比，一亩地种小麦，上五车猪粪，收小麦二百九十三斤，早熟二天；另一亩小麦，上豆饼一百斤，收小麦二百九十斤，晚收二天。小麦收后，仍用这两亩地种玉米和绿豆继续试验，原上猪粪的地再上四车粪，结果收玉米二百八十五斤、绿豆四十五斤；原上豆饼的地再上八十斤豆饼，结果收玉米二百七十斤、绿豆三十斤。
    1954年这个社又进行了猪粪和肥田粉的肥效对比，共用四亩地种谷子，土质和耕作条件相同，有二亩施猪粪七车（基肥四车、追肥三车），每亩收谷子六百七十斤；另二亩施肥田粉四十五斤（基肥二十斤、追肥二十五斤），每亩收谷子四百八十七斤。
    湖南望城县西塘农业社1954年4月用两亩水田播种中稻，进行猪粪和芝麻饼的肥效对比，一亩施猪粪二十五担，收稻谷六百二十五斤；一亩施芝麻饼三十六斤，收稻谷四百斤。
    从这些对比可以看出猪粪尿的肥效是很好的，成本也比较低廉。但是，以目前全国所有的猪同耕地面积比较，每十六、七亩地才有一头猪供给肥料，这是远远不能满足农业生产的需要的。如果按每头猪粪的肥田三亩计算，肥田不过三万亩，只等于全国现有耕地的五分之一，还有五分之四的耕地没有猪粪。因此，必须多养猪才能在今后较长时期内解决肥料不足的问题。
    合算不合算
    多养猪，需要饲料就多。那末，是不是会影响人的口粮呢？这是许多人非常关心的问题，也是关系到究竟应不应该大量发展养猪事业的问题。
    要弄清楚这个问题，必须算两笔账：一笔是一头猪的粪尿究竟能增产多少粮食，一笔是一头猪究竟需要吃多少精饲料和青饲料。前一笔账，前面已经有了：大体能增产三百斤至三百五十斤粮食。饲养一头猪从小到大（一百五十斤）约需精饲料二百斤至三百斤，青饲料一千五百斤至二千斤。如果将一头猪的粪尿的一半或一半稍多一点用于增产粮食作物，就够一头猪的精饲料，其余的粪肥用二分之一去增产青饲料，还有部分粪肥可以用于增产粮食以供人食。同时增加了猪肉，人多吃了肉还可以减少粮食的消费。每一头猪至少可产油十斤，养猪多了猪油增多，还可相应地减少油料作物的播种面积，用来改种粮食作物。这就是说，如果全国多养一千万头肥猪，除去需要支出猪吃的精饲料折原粮二十至三十亿斤以外，还需要青饲料一百五十至二百亿斤。如果这些青饲料全部靠耕地种植，约需二百万亩耕地（每一头猪所需的青饲料在南方约需一分至一分半地即足够，北方可能要多些，全国平均以每头二分地计算），这会减少二百万亩粮食的种植面积。但是每头猪出十斤油，可以减少植物油的消费，大体每头猪油可顶替三分之一亩地所产的菜油，一千万头肥猪的油即可顶替三百万亩地所产的菜油。因此，这三百万亩地可以用来改种粮食，这样种了青饲料就不会影响粮食播种面积。而一千万头肥猪的粪尿则可增产粮食三十至三十五亿斤。除去这些猪所吃的二十至三十亿斤精饲料（折粮）以外，还可余出十到十五亿斤。由此看来，多养猪、多积肥就多打粮食，多吃猪油就少吃植物油，植物油需要少了又可减少耕地改种粮食，这一笔大账是必须要算的，而且也是合算的。
    应该特别指出，养猪→积肥→增产，积肥→增产→养猪，周而复始地循环着，而其中具有决定作用的一环则是积肥。因为即使多养了猪，如果不注意积肥，就不能达到增产的目的，以后也就不能再多养猪了。这就会影响这个循环周而复始地顺利进行。只有注意积肥，才能保证增产，从而才能保证再多养猪。
    猪粪怎样折价
    过去农民养猪，主要目的是为了积肥，其次是为了零钱凑整钱，也有的为了能吃肉。农业合作化以后，土地归农业社统一使用，农民养猪的目的发生了变化：所积粪肥绝大部分是归社使用，自留地有限，需粪不多。这就出现了农业社对社员养猪所积粪肥究竟应该如何作价的新问题。
    首先应该肯定，农业社使用社员养猪所积的粪肥是应该作价而且必须作价的。如果不给代价就会影响社员养猪和积肥的积极性。
    粪肥作价必须合理，既要照顾社的利益，又要照顾社员的利益。至于究竟应该作价多少才算合理？这不能一概而论，必须根据各地养猪多少、积肥的方法、对粪肥的需求，农民积肥的习惯，以及积肥与其他劳动报酬的比较、猪粪和其他肥料的肥效对比来决定。目前有的农业社是根据猪粪和豆饼、化学肥料进行效果对比来决定的；也有的是计算每头猪从小到大能积多少粪肥，这些粪肥能增产多少粮食、值多少钱，然后将增产所值的一部分作为劳动报酬，另一部分作猪粪代价。这些办法都是可行的。
    至于具体计价的方法，目前各地采用的，大体有三种：一种是按头给价，即每头猪的粪肥全部归社使用，由社按头付给一定代价。这种办法虽然简便，但猪的大小不一，所积粪肥的数量和质量也不同，不易作到公平合理。另一种办法是按车（或担）按质作价，就是将粪肥分为若干等级，优质优价，劣质次价。按车计的是北方各省，按担计的是南方各地。这种计价办法的好处是能够实行优质优价，但评定等级的工作也不简单，（有的由社专门组织评议小组，有的由生产队民主选举几人评定）工作量大，而且对等级评定也不易掌握。还有一种是根据按猪的大小，养的时间长短，按猪体斤重分段计算粪价。如河北昌黎是：体重二十五斤到六十斤的猪，每长一斤给粪钱一角，六十五斤到一百斤的，每斤一角三分，百斤以上的每斤一角五分。江苏泰兴是：十五斤到四十斤的每斤八分，四十一斤到七十斤的，每斤一角，七十一斤到一百斤的每斤一角二分，一百零一斤到一百五十斤的每斤一角四分，一百五十斤以上的每斤一角五分半。按照社员卖猪的时候，体重根据上述规定分段计价，一次结算。对圈肥的管理，昌黎县是由社负责管理（拉土垫圈、起粪等），泰兴县是由社员管理（不需垫土）。这种方法的好处是不需要评级也能实行优质优价。以上第二和第三种办法都比较好的；如果采用第二种办法，必须注意作好评级工作。无论采取什么计价办法，都必须贯彻执行优质优价的原则。如果圈肥由社员自己管理，农业社必须给社员拉土垫圈的时间，对劳动力缺乏的社员要照顾。如果圈肥由社管理，农业社对社员自留地所需要的肥料和社员所积零星散肥（如拾的粪、攒的灰土和脏土等）的存放等问题，要妥善解决。
    我国目前还有相当一部分地区是“人无厕所，猪无圈”的，使许多很好的肥料散失浪费了。浙江宁波专区农场试验过，把九十六头猪白天散放在外边，每天只能积肥二百多斤；改用猪圈养猪，每天能积肥一千零三十二斤，增加了四倍。过去养猪不注意积肥的地区，应加强对群众的教育，改变散放的习惯，以增加积肥数量。
