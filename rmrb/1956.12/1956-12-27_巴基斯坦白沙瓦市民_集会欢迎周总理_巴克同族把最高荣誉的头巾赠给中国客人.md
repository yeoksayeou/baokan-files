Xinhua News Agency, Peshawar, 26th - Premier Zhou Enlai extended his congratulations to the people of Pakistan on December 25th, the eightieth anniversary of the birth of Pakistan's founder, Jinnah.

Premier Zhou made this congratulatory statement at a welcome reception held by the citizens of Peshawar for the Chinese guests. His speech elicited prolonged applause from those in attendance.

Among those attending the reception were Hussaini, the Minister of Transport for West Pakistan, Juberi, the Commissioner of the Peshawar District, and two hundred prominent figures from Peshawar. Premier Zhou Enlai, who is scheduled to leave Peshawar for Lahore on the 26th, thanked the government and people of the city for their hospitality. He said, "We are very pleased to have spent two enjoyable and meaningful days in Peshawar, a city renowned for its long history of culture and its heroic traditions in the struggle against colonial rule." He said that the people of this region's desire to seek knowledge, maintain their beautiful cultural traditions, and engage in peaceful construction, have left a deep impression on the Chinese guests. He expressed his hope that the friendship between China and Pakistan, with their long-standing traditions, will continue to grow with the passage of time.

In his welcoming speech, Abab Nur Muhammad, a leader of the People's Alliance, said that the warm hospitality of the people of Peshawar to their guests "demonstrates their deep friendship for your country and people." He continued, "In the Middle Ages, Chinese travelers recorded what they saw with their own eyes in this place, which has become a valuable part of our history. We are pleased to know that another distinguished traveler from this great country is now with us. We believe that this visit will also become an important part of our history." He expressed his sincere hope that the friendly and harmonious relations between Pakistan and China would be further developed, so that the two countries could work together towards their cherished goals - peace and prosperity.

The citizens of Peshawar presented Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long with locally produced handmade guns.

Xinhua News Agency, Mardan, Pakistan, 25th - Premier Zhou Enlai and his party visited the Warsak Dam construction site on the Kabul River, nineteen miles northwest of Peshawar, this morning. He was accompanied by Syed Abid Hussaini, the Minister of Transport for West Pakistan, and others.

The dam builders warmly welcomed the Chinese Premier upon his arrival at the construction site.

From Warsak, the guests traveled by car to Mardan, a town in the center of a sugarcane-growing region. In Mardan (the word means "the place where a handsome and virile man arrives"), the Chinese Premier visited a large sugar factory. He was garlanded upon his arrival there. This highly mechanized factory was established by Pakistan after its independence.

Along the way from Peshawar to Mardan, the Muhammad tribe and other tribes living in the area flocked to the village streets to welcome the guests. They erected many welcoming arches along the village streets. The arches were decorated with hand-woven carpets with beautiful lace edges. Some arches were made of sugarcane freshly cut from the fields. As the cars entered Mardan, adorned with flags, the entire road was lined with cheering people and children, wearing white turbans, baggy trousers, and wrapped in blankets to ward off the morning chill.

Xinhua News Agency, Peshawar, 26th - Premier Zhou Enlai was ceremoniously wrapped in a traditional Pakhtun turban on the 25th, thus becoming a brother member of the Pakhtun tribe of Pakistan. This is the first time in several hundred years that a foreigner has received this highest honor from the Pakhtun people.

The turban-tying ceremony took place at the palatial residence of Colonel Amir Khan, son of the Nawab (tribal chief) of Hoti town. Hoti town is about forty miles from Peshawar. The Nawab's son, wearing a black embroidered cloak, led Zhou Enlai to the stage and tied the turban on his head. The more than one hundred elders of the Yusufzai tribe of the Pakhtuns who attended the ceremony applauded enthusiastically.

Colonel Amir Khan, a leading figure of the Pakhtuns and the lord of Hoti town and neighboring territories, spoke on behalf of all the Pakhtuns, saying:

"We Pakhtuns, in accordance with our ancient traditions, have decided to treat our most respected guest as our compatriot. In order to fulfill this commitment, we are now holding this turban-tying ceremony to bestow the honor of solidarity upon our most noble guest."

He explained, "This action links Mr. Zhou Enlai with us, and we sincerely hope that he will also happily acknowledge this fraternal relationship with us. I assure His Excellency that the Pakhtuns of Pakistan will stand with him in the face of any rigorous test."

He continued, "This joyous event marks a new era of freedom and friendship between our two countries."

Zhou Enlai, looking dashing with a turban embroidered with gold flowers on top, expressed his heartfelt gratitude and said: "After wearing this traditional turban, I have become a friend and brother of the Pakhtuns and the people of Pakistan. I hope that you will also become friends and brothers of the Chinese people. I hope that the people of the whole world will become friends and brothers, and cooperate closely with each other."

His words were greeted with enthusiastic applause.

Zhou Enlai and his party were invited to attend a luncheon hosted by the Nawab's son, in a house decorated with traditional art pictures and portraits of the host's ancestors. Tribal leaders wearing turbans and large shawl-like cloaks sat with the Chinese guests, eating a Pakhtun lunch. The menu included roasted whole lamb, with the lamb's belly stuffed with spiced rice.

Before Zhou Enlai and his party took their leave, they were presented with Pakhtun robes and hats and slippers embroidered with gold flowers.

Other places visited by Zhou Enlai and his party on the 25th included:

The sugar factory in Mardan, the Amangarh high-grade paper and cardboard factory, and the Tarnab agricultural research station.

    新华社白沙瓦26日电　周恩来总理在巴基斯坦缔造者真纳诞生八十周年这一天——12月25日晚上向巴基斯坦人民表示祝贺。
    周总理是在白沙瓦市民为中国客人举行的欢迎晚会上表示这个祝贺的。他的讲话在到会的人们中间引起了经久不息的掌声。
    参加晚会的有西巴基斯坦交通部长侯赛尼、白沙瓦区专员朱贝里和白沙瓦市的两百位社会名流。预定在26日离开白沙瓦赴拉合尔的周恩来总理感谢这个城市的政府和人民的殷勤招待。他说，我们很高兴能在以悠久文化和在反对殖民统治的斗争中的英雄传统闻名的白沙瓦度过愉快的、有意义的两天。他说，这个地区的人民寻求知识、保持他们的优美的文化传统和进行和平建设的愿望和努力，给中国客人很深的印象。他说，他希望有着悠久传统的中国和巴基斯坦的友谊将随着时间的推移而不断增长。
    人民联盟领袖阿巴布·努尔·穆罕默德在致欢迎词时说，白沙瓦人民对客人的殷勤招待“表明了他们对你们国家和人民的深厚友谊”。他接着说，在中世纪，中国旅行者记述了在这个地方亲眼看到的情况，这已经成为我们历史的宝贵的一部分。我们很高兴地知道，这个伟大的国家的另一个卓越的旅行者现在正在和我们一起。我们相信，这次访问也将成为我们历史的一个重要部分。他说，他诚恳地希望巴基斯坦和中国之间的友好和谐的关系得到进一步发展，这样两国就可以并肩走向它们所珍视的目标——和平和繁荣。
    白沙瓦市民以当地名产手工制造的枪枝赠给周恩来总理和贺龙副总理。
    据新华社巴基斯坦马丹25日电  周恩来总理一行今天上午参观了白沙瓦西北十九英里的喀布尔河上的瓦萨克水坝工地。陪同他前去的有西巴基斯坦交通部长赛义德·阿比德·侯赛尼等。
    当中国总理到达工地时，水坝建筑者们热烈地欢迎他们。
    客人们从瓦萨克乘车驰往甘蔗种植区中心的市镇马丹。在马丹（这个字的意思是一个健美而有男子气概的人所到的地方），中国总理访问了大制糖厂。在他到达那里时，人们给他戴上花环。这个高度机械化的工厂是巴基斯坦在独立后建立起来的。
    从白沙瓦到马丹的沿途，穆罕默德部族和居住在这个地区的其他部族的人民成群地跑到乡村街道上来欢迎客人。他们在乡村街道上竖立了很多欢迎客人的拱门。在拱门上挂着手织的、镶着美丽的花边的地毯。有些拱门是用刚从园地里割下来的甘蔗搭成的。当汽车驶入挂满着旗帜的马丹时，汽车所经过的整个路上，两旁都站满了欢呼的人们和儿童，他们戴着白色的头巾，穿着灯笼裤，并且裹着毯子以抵御清晨的寒冷。
    据新华社白沙瓦26日电　周恩来总理25日被隆重地缠上一块巴克同族的传统头巾，这样他就成了巴基斯坦的巴克同族的一个兄弟成员。一个外国人得到巴克同族人民的这个最高荣誉，近几百年来这还是第一次。
    系头巾的仪式在霍蒂镇纳瓦布（部落首领）之子阿密尔汗上校的宫殿似的住宅里举行。霍蒂镇离白沙瓦大约四十英里。纳瓦布之子披着黑色的绣花斗篷领着周恩来走到台上，给他的头上缠上头巾。参加仪式的一百多个巴克同族的尤萨弗泽部落长者热烈地鼓掌。
    巴克同族人的领导人物、霍蒂镇和邻近领地的所有主阿密尔汗上校代表全体巴克同族人讲话，他说：
  “我们巴克同族人遵照我们的古老传统，决定把我们最尊敬的客人当作我们的同胞，为了实现这个保证，我们现在举行这次系头巾的仪式把表示团结的荣誉授给我们的最高贵的客人。”
    他解释道：“这个行动把周恩来先生同我们联结了起来，我们真诚希望他也高兴地承认同我们的这个兄弟关系。我向他阁下保证，巴基斯坦的巴克同族人在任何严格考验面前都将同他站在一起。”
    他接着说：“这件喜事标志着自由和我们两国间的友谊的新纪元。”
    周恩来缠着一条顶上绣着金花的头巾显得很潇洒，他表示了衷心的感谢，并且说：“戴上这块传统的头巾以后，我已经成为巴克同族人和巴基斯坦人民的朋友和兄弟了。我希望你们也成为中国人民的朋友和兄弟。我希望全世界的人民都成为朋友和兄弟，彼此密切合作。”
    他这番话博得热烈的掌声。
    周恩来一行应邀出席了纳瓦布之子的午宴，举行午宴的房子里挂着一些传统艺术图片和主人的祖先肖像。缠着头巾的部落领袖们带着大围巾式披风，同中国客人们坐在一起，吃着巴克同族人的午餐。这顿午餐的菜单中有烧全羔羊，羔羊的肚子里装着用香料拌好的大米。
    在周恩来一行告辞以前，人们送给他们一些巴克同族长袍和绣着金花的帽子及拖鞋。
    周恩来一行在25日访问的其他地方有：
    马尔丹的糖厂、阿曼加尔的高级纸和硬纸板厂、特尔纳布的农业研究站等。
