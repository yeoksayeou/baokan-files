    NPC Deputies and CPPCC Members
    Continue Inspection Work in Various Places
    Offer Suggestions for Improvement on Teaching and Other Work in Guangzhou
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Guangdong inspection group of National People's Congress deputies and National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members, including Zhang Zhizhong, Cai Tingkai, Shao Lizi, Zhang Naiqi, and 24 others, concluded their inspection work in Guangzhou City and departed for various parts of Guangdong Province on the 10th.
    In Guangzhou, the deputies and members focused on inspecting higher education institutions, scientific research work, and the implementation of policies regarding senior intellectuals.
    They noted that after the proposition of "research work should serve teaching" in higher education institutions, many teachers were not entirely clear on how to integrate research work with teaching work, leading to an imbalance in the weighting of the two.
    The deputies and members believed that Guangdong Province's education policy should adapt to local characteristics. For example, Guangdong has many tropical and subtropical plants, as well as Hainan Island awaiting development, thus requiring the training of agricultural, forestry, and botany professionals in these fields. However, the departments, faculties, and specializations of Guangzhou's higher education institutions are generally too standardized and seldom take these characteristics into account.
    During the inspection, the deputies and members also saw that some enterprise departments had not earnestly implemented the policies regarding senior intellectuals. Many engineering and technical personnel were still busy with administrative affairs all day long and had no time to improve their professional knowledge. The phenomenon of numerous and lengthy meetings persisted. The method of political study was too rigid, failing to consider the characteristics of senior intellectuals, inappropriately emphasizing collective study, and only requiring the completion of the prescribed time without regard for effectiveness.
    The deputies and members also noted the lack of good connections between teaching and research institutions and factories and enterprises. Because personnel from both sides could not regularly exchange experiences, many theoretical problems in factories and enterprises could not find anyone to consult, while teaching and research personnel could not find places for practical application. Representative Lei Jieqiong suggested that in the future, the Guangzhou branch of the China Association for Science and Technology should take on the responsibility of bridging the relationship between the two sides and organizing experience exchange work.
    The deputies and members also inspected the work of the judiciary, postal and telecommunications, railway transportation, and other departments.

    Express Satisfaction with Fujian's Water Conservancy Construction Achievements
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Fu Zuoyi, National People's Congress deputy and Minister of Water Resources, inspected Fujian Province's water conservancy work and expressed satisfaction with the achievements in water conservancy construction in Fujian.
    Fu Zuoyi inspected more than a dozen representative water conservancy projects in Fujian Province. He carefully checked the quality of the projects and made suggestions on the maintenance of water conservancy projects to the engineering management personnel on the spot. Fu Zuoyi believes that Fujian Province is rich in water resources and should be developed and utilized as much as possible. In particular, small-scale water conservancy facilities require small investment, yield quick results, and can mobilize the masses to vigorously construct. Fu Zuoyi suggested that Fujian Province should collect and organize more information on water conservancy projects to prepare for future large-scale basin planning and comprehensive management. He also suggested vigorously cultivating intermediate-level technical personnel and considering the establishment of water conservancy research and experimental institutions in order to study experiences from other provinces or countries and apply them to Fujian Province's water conservancy construction.
    Fu Zuoyi also criticized the shortcomings of some water conservancy projects with low quality. He personally inspected the breach in the Jinjiang flood control dike that was breached by floods this year, the cracks on the top of the Tingxi Reservoir dam, and put forward repair suggestions. Regarding the Shibitou Reservoir under construction, he believed that the spillway was too wide and had a curve, and that the flow rate would be too high when overflowing in the future, which could easily cause danger and should be corrected in a timely manner.

    Criticism and Suggestions on Rural Work in Fujian
    According to Xinhua News Agency, National People's Congress deputy Xie Xuehong, after inspecting rural areas in Fujian Province, suggested to leading organs and working cadres at all levels that they should pay more attention to the suffering of the masses and establish a working system to solve the demands put forward by the masses.
    Xie Xuehong saw during her inspection that the major issues in production and collectivization in the rural areas of Fujian Province were basically well resolved, this year's agricultural harvest was bountiful, and the lives of farmers had improved. For this reason, a sense of complacency and paralysis had grown among rural cadres, who believed that the suffering and voices of the farmers were minor matters and did not pay attention to them, nor did they actively help solve them.
    Xie Xuehong held symposiums with farmers in rural areas, went deep into farmers' homes for visits, and received visits from the masses. In her contact with farmers, she heard reflections such as: because local cadres neglected the organization and leadership of sideline production, many farmers had grain but no money; some agricultural cooperatives arranged production work very tightly, members had no time to manage their private plots, and even had to spend money to buy green vegetables. When mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production, insufficient consideration was given to their physiological characteristics, and some women's health was affected by overwork.
    Xie Xuehong said that some of these issues were individual in nature, some had been resolved, but many cadres still considered these to be insignificant matters and did not pay attention to them. Xie Xuehong criticized the prevailing argument among some cadres that "large cooperatives cannot take care of many small things" and "as long as production can be increased, there is no problem."
    Xie Xuehong suggested to the relevant leading organs that they should educate cadres at all levels to care about the suffering of the masses, listen to the voices of the masses, and establish the necessary working system to ensure that the demands raised by the masses of farmers can be accounted for. For some relatively important issues, the leading organs need to send cadres or work teams in a timely manner to specifically help townships and cooperatives solve them, and should not delay.
    From November 19 to December 14, Xie Xuehong inspected rural work in Fuzhou and Longxi areas. Also inspecting with her were National People's Congress deputies He Sui, Jiang Yong, Liu Yongsheng, and CPPCC National Committee specially invited personage Chu Xichun, and others. They also put forward a number of suggestions, including strengthening democratic life in rural areas and further implementing the Marriage Law.

    全国人民代表大会代表和政协委员
    继续在各地视察工作
    对广州的教学等工作提出改进意见
    据新华社讯  全国人民代表大会代表和政协全国委员会委员广东视察组张治中、蔡廷锴、邵力子、章乃器等二十八人结束了在广州市的视察工作，已经在10日分赴广东省各地视察。
    代表和委员们在广州市着重视察了高等学校、科学研究工作和高级知识分子政策的执行情况。
    他们注意到，在高等学校提出
  “研究工作为教学服务”以后，许多教员对研究工作与教学工作如何结合的问题还不十分明确，以至两者的比重放得不够恰当。
    代表和委员们认为，广东省的教育方针应该适应于当地的特点。例如，广东多热带和亚热带植物，还有等待开发的海南岛，因此需要培养这方面的农林、植物的专业人材。但是广州高等学校的科、系和专业的划分一般化，很少照顾到这些特点。
    代表和委员们在视察中还看到，某些企业部门没有认真执行关于高级知识分子的政策。不少工程技术人员仍然整天忙于事务，没有时间提高专业知识。会议多而长的现象仍然存在。政治学习的方法太死板，没有照顾到高级知识分子的特点而不适当的强调集体学习，并只要求学满规定时间，不讲效果。
    代表和委员们还注意到，教学研究机关和工厂企业之间没有很好的联系。由于两方面的人员不能经常交流经验，因此工厂企业中许多理论问题找不到人请教，而教学研究人员又找不到地方实践。雷洁琼代表建议，今后中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会广州分会应该负起沟通两方面关系的责任，组织交流经验的工作。
    代表和委员们还视察了司法、邮电、铁路交通等部门的工作。
    对福建的水利建设成绩表示满意
    据新华社讯  全国人民代表大会代表、水利部部长傅作义视察了福建省的水利工作以后，对福建的水利建设成绩表示满意。
    傅作义在福建省视察了十多个具有代表性的水利工程。他仔细地检查了工程质量，并且当场对工程管理人员提出水利工程维护保养的意见。傅作义认为，福建省的水利资源丰富，应该尽量开发利用。特别是小型水利设施，投资小，收效快，可以发动群众大力兴修。傅作义建议福建省应该多搜集和整理一些有关水利工程方面的资料，为将来大规模的流域规划和综合治理准备条件。他还建议大力培养中级技术人材，并且考虑设立水利的研究和实验机构，以便对外省或外国的经验进行研究，运用到福建省的水利建设中去。
    傅作义还批评了一些水利工程质量不高的缺点。他亲自视察了今年被洪水冲破的晋江防洪大堤的缺口、汀溪水库拦洪坝顶的裂痕，并且提出检修的意见。对正在施工的石壁头水库，他认为溢洪道过宽且有弯度，将来溢洪时流速过大容易发生危险，应该及时纠正。
    对福建的农村工作提出批评和建议
    据新华社讯  全国人民代表大会代表谢雪红在视察了福建省农村以后，向各级领导机关和工作干部建议，要更多关心群众生活疾苦，并且建立工作制度来解决群众提出的要求。
    谢雪红在视察中看到，福建省农村中生产和合作化方面的重大问题基本上是解决得好的，今年农业丰收，农民生活有了改善。因为这个缘故，在农村干部中就滋长了一种自满麻痹情绪，认为农民的生活疾苦和呼声是小事情，而不加以注意，不积极帮助解决。
    谢雪红在农村曾同农民举行了座谈会，还深入农家访问，接待了群众来访。她同农民接触中，听到农民有这样一些反映：因为当地干部忽视了对副业生产的组织和领导，不少农民有粮没有钱，有些农业社把生产工作安排得很紧，社员没有时间去经营自留地，甚至连青菜都要花钱买。在发动妇女参加农业生产时，对他们生理上的特点照顾不够，有些妇女因劳动过度，影响了她们的健康。
    谢雪红说，这些问题，有些是个别性质的，有些已经得到解决，但是还有不少干部认为这些是无关紧要的小事情而不加以注意。谢雪红批评了在部分干部中流行的所谓“办大社照顾不了许多小事情”，“只要能够增产就没有问题”的论调。
    谢雪红向有关领导机关建议，要教育各级干部关心群众疾苦，倾听群众呼声，建立必要的工作制度，保证农民群众提出来的要求都能有所交代。有些比较重大的问题，领导机关需要及时地派干部或工作组具体帮助乡和社解决，不要拖延。
    谢雪红从11月19日到12月14日，视察了福州和龙溪地区农村工作，和她一起视察的还有全国人民代表大会代表何遂、江庸、刘永生，政协全国委员会特别邀请人士楚溪春等。他们还提出加强农村民主生活，进一步贯彻婚姻法等多项建议。
