    Edible Oil Extracted from Wheat Germ
    The Qingdao Municipal Oil Production Increase Committee Office, in collaboration with the technical personnel of the Grain Industry Company, has successfully experimented with extracting edible oil with high nutritional value from wheat germ.

    Each hundred catties of wheat germ can produce four catties and two taels of oil, containing 0.25% of Vitamin E. They believe that extracting the wheat germ from wheat not only does not affect the flour yield of wheat, but also avoids flour spoilage caused by the deterioration of fat in the germ, which can extend the storage time of flour.

    The oil content of wheat germ is about 12%. In the past, during the milling process, most of it came out with the bran, and a small part was mixed into coarser flour. The cake after wheat germ oil extraction can be used as high-quality feed, and it can also be used to manufacture maltose, soy sauce, or alcohol. (Xinhua News Agency)

    小麦胚芽里提食油
    青岛市油脂增产委员会办公室协同粮食工业公司的技术人员试验的从小麦胚芽里提取营养价值较高的食油，最近已经成功。
    每百斤小麦胚芽可以出油四斤二两，含有0.25％的戊种维生素。他们认为从小麦里把胚芽提取出来，不但不影响小麦的出粉率，还能避免因为胚芽中的脂肪变质而引起面粉发霉，可以延长面粉的贮存时间。
    小麦胚芽的含油率在12％左右。过去，它在磨面过程中，大部分随着麸皮一起出来，小部分则混入较粗的面粉里。小麦胚芽榨油以后的饼可以作上等饲料，还可以用它制造饴糖、酱油或酒精。（新华社）
