Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 4th. The late autumn silkworm rearing work in Zhejiang Province has concluded. According to statistics from the provincial special product departments, the total output of spring, summer, and autumn silkworm cocoons in the province this year reached more than 550,000 dan, an increase of nearly 60,000 dan compared to last year, and one and a half times more than in the early days of liberation. The unit yield per silkworm egg card in each silkworm rearing season was also higher than in previous years.

This year, many high-yield silkworm cocoon records have also emerged in various places. The Wuyi Agricultural Cooperative in Fenghua County produced an average of 91.5 jin of cocoons per card for eight spring silkworm egg cards. The Chongren First Agricultural Cooperative in Sheng County, where the famous high-yield silkworm cocoon model worker Aunt Dong is located, produced an average of 60.45 jin of cocoons per card for thirty-six summer silkworm egg cards. The Youyi Agricultural Cooperative in Hangzhou County produced an average of 65.5 jin of cocoons per card for twenty late autumn silkworm egg cards.

According to the identification materials of the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Company, as of the third quarter, the silk reeled from Zhejiang Province's silkworm cocoons can reach Double A grade, while last year it was below A grade. In 1952, it took 361.6 jin of dry cocoons to reel one dan of raw silk, but this year only 294 jin of dry cocoons are needed.

This year, the silkworm rearing areas in Zhejiang Province, in addition to the original 37 counties and cities, have also newly developed 27 counties. The farmers in these new silkworm areas have achieved good results in trial rearing, and some have produced higher cocoon yields than the general cocoon yields in the old silkworm areas. Many places have also successfully trial-reared late autumn silkworms. This year, advanced experiences centered on high-temperature rapid silkworm rearing methods have been widely promoted in various places, which has promoted the increase in silkworm cocoon yield and quality, and generally shortened the rearing time by two to three days.

　　浙江蚕茧增产
　  比去年增加近六万担
    新华社杭州4日电　浙江省各地晚秋蚕的饲养工作结束。据省特产部门统计，今年全省春、夏、秋蚕茧总产量达到五十五万多担，比去年增加近六万担，比解放初期增加一倍半。各个养蚕季节每张蚕种的单位产量也都比往年高。
    今年各地还出现了许多蚕茧丰产纪录。奉化县五一农业社饲养的八张春蚕种，每张平均产茧量高达九十一斤半。著名的蚕茧丰产模范董大妈所在的嵊县崇仁第一农业社，饲养三十六张夏蚕种，平均每张产茧六十斤九两。杭县友谊农业社饲养的二十张晚秋蚕种，平均每张产茧六十五斤半。
    据浙江省丝绸公司鉴定材料，到第三季度为止，浙江省蚕茧所缫的丝可以达到双A级，而去年是不到A级。1952年缫一担生丝需要三百六十一点六斤干茧，今年只要两百九十四斤干茧就够了。
    今年浙江省的养蚕地区，除了原有的三十七个县、市以外，还有新发展的二十七个县。这些新蚕区农民试养的成绩很好，有的产茧量高于老蚕区的一般产茧量。还有很多地方试养晚秋蚕成功。今年各地普遍推广了以高温快速养蚕法为中心的先进经验，促进了蚕茧产量和质量的提高，并且一般都缩短了两天到三天的饲养时间。
