Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd, New York dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru concluded his six-day visit to the United States on the 21st and left New York by plane that evening for Ottawa, the capital of Canada.

On the morning of the 21st, Nehru went to the United Nations to attend a luncheon hosted by UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and held private talks with Hammarskjöld and the President of the Eleventh Session of the UN General Assembly, Prince Wan of Thailand.

Subsequently, Nehru held talks with representatives of the Asian-African group of countries at the United Nations. Nehru pointed out the important role of the Asian-African group to the representatives. He said, "The tremendous changes in the past two years have changed the balance of world power in favor of Asia and Africa. The habit of countries outside this region deciding the future of countries in this region is now less obvious." However, "this idea has not been completely abandoned."

Nehru emphasized the significance of the Bandung Conference, saying that the Bandung Conference firmly believed in creating a future with free and independent countries and firmly believed in a system of worldwide cooperation.

Nehru then visited representatives of Commonwealth countries. He said that despite differences and disagreements within the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth still plays a "significant role" in world affairs.

Before leaving the United Nations, Nehru told reporters that he hoped there would be sufficient news flow between countries, saying, "Correct news reporting would greatly help ease the atmosphere of hostility."

On this day, Nehru also held talks with the board of directors of the Far East-America Council of Commerce and Industry (an organization of American businessmen with companies in India). According to a spokesman who participated in the talks, the talks discussed India's economic development plans and private investment in India.

The day before, Nehru also met with Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and in his talks with Shigemitsu, he expressed his willingness to visit Japan in the future.

    新华社22日讯　纽约消息：印度总理尼赫鲁在21日结束了在美国的六天的访问，当天晚上乘飞机离开纽约前往加拿大首都渥太华。
    21日上午，尼赫鲁前往联合国出席了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的午宴，并且同哈马舍尔德和联合国大会第十一届会议主席泰国的旺亲王进行了秘密会谈。
    随后，尼赫鲁同联合国中的亚非集团国家的代表进行了会谈。尼赫鲁向代表们指出亚非集团的重要作用。他说，“过去两年中的巨大变化已经使世界力量对比发生对亚非两洲有利的变化。由这个地区以外的国家来决定本地区国家前途的那种习惯现在是不那么明显了。”虽然，“这种思想并没有完全放弃。”
    尼赫鲁强调了万隆会议的意义，他说，万隆会议深信可以创造一个有自由和独立的国家的前途，并且深信全世界合作的制度。
    尼赫鲁接着访问了英联邦国家的代表。他说，尽管英联邦内部有分歧和不同意见，英联邦仍然在世界事务中起着“重大作用”。
    尼赫鲁在离开联合国之前，向记者们表示了希望各国之间能有足够的新闻流通，他说，“正确的新闻报道将大大有助于敌对气氛的缓和。”
    在这一天，尼赫鲁还同美国远东工商业理事会（这是一个在印度设有公司的美国商人的组织）的董事会进行了会谈。据参加会谈的发言人说，会谈讨论了印度的经济发展计划和在印度的私人投资问题。
    前一天，尼赫鲁还接见了日本外务相重光，他在同重光的会谈中表示将来愿意访问日本。
