Xinhua News Agency, Amman, December 27th: Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi told reporters at a resort near the Dead Sea on the 26th that Jordan would abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty within a few months and order Britain to close its bases in Jordan.

Nabulsi said that Jordan is now taking steps to obtain aid from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia to replace the annual British subsidies to Jordan. He said this aid will continue until Jordan is self-sufficient.

Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia have promised to provide Jordan with aid to replace British subsidies. Nabulsi had said that Jordan would not abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty until it received aid from the above three countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Amman, December 27th: The Jordanian Ministry of Defense announced on the 25th that Jordan had formally rejected Iraq's request to station "military liaison officers" in Jordan as assistants to the Iraqi military attaché in the Jordanian embassy.

The Jordanian Ministry of Defense said that some Iraqi officers had arrived in Amman, but they are expected to leave soon. These officers were sent to Jordan as liaison officers between the Iraqi and Jordanian armies after the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt. At that time, Iraq sent troops to Jordan in the name of assisting Jordan. In mid-December, under the insistence of the Jordanian government, the Iraqi troops withdrew from Jordan, but these liaison officers did not withdraw.

    约旦首相纳布西说
    将在数月内废除英约条约
    新华社27日讯　安曼消息：约旦首相纳布西26日在死海附近的休养地对记者说，约旦将在几个月内废除英国—约旦条约，并且命令英国撤销它在约旦的基地。
    纳布西说，约旦现在正在采取步骤以便从埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯获得援助来代替英国每年给约旦的津贴。他说，这种援助将一直要继续到约旦能够自足自给时为止。
    埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯曾经答应给予约旦援助，以代替英国给约旦的津贴。纳布西曾经说，约旦在没有得到上述三个国家的援助以前，将不废除英国—约旦条约。
    新华社27日讯　安曼消息：约旦国防部在25日宣布，约旦已经正式拒绝伊拉克的下述要求：伊拉克派“军事联络官”驻在约旦，作为伊拉克驻约旦大使馆武官的助手。
    约旦国防部说，已经有一些伊拉克军官到达安曼，但是，预料他们不久就会离开。这些军官是在英、法、以色列进攻埃及以后派到约旦充当伊拉克军队和约旦军队之间的联络官的。伊拉克在那时候曾经以援助约旦的名义派军队到约旦。12月中旬，在约旦政府的坚持下，伊拉克军队撤出了约旦，但是这些充当联络官的军官没有撤走。
