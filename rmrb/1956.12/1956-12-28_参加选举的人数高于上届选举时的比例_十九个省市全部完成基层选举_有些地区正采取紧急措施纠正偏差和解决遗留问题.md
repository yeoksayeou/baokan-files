Xinhua News Agency, December 27th - The grassroots election work of 1956 is nearing completion. Currently, nineteen provinces (autonomous regions) and cities, including Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Hunan, Guizhou, and Beijing, have completed their grassroots election work and are generally convening the first meetings of the second county and city People's Congresses. The grassroots election work in other provinces (autonomous regions) will also be completed soon.

During the election process, many regions fully promoted democracy, widely mobilized the masses to criticize the government's work and the cadres' work style, and strictly selected representative candidates, resulting in a new atmosphere after the elections. In Tie Zhuang Township, Qinhuangdao City, Hebei Province, after the voters deliberated and discussed the list of candidates, when it was presented to the masses for further discussion, opinions were raised regarding six of the forty-seven candidates, requesting their replacement, until the most satisfactory candidates were proposed. In Pingzhuang Township, Kalaqin Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, within half a month after the election, more than thirty representatives voluntarily went to the township People's Committee to reflect the opinions and demands of the masses. Yang Jinhua, a people's representative of Daojiao Township, Chongqing City, did not pay enough attention to the lives of the masses in the past. During the election, the masses raised many opinions to him. After being elected, he improved his working methods and work style based on the opinions of the masses, promptly understood the situation of ninety-three households of members with difficult lives, and put forward specific opinions such as reducing or exempting public grain and providing living subsidies for the People's Committee to handle. The People's Congress meetings and People's Committee meetings held after the elections were generally better than in the past, overcoming the past shortcomings of formalism. For example, when Shenzhong Township, Huangyuan County, Qinghai Province, held the People's Congress meeting, it widely promoted democracy. Representatives raised seventy criticisms and suggestions on the government's work and the cadres' work style at the meeting. One of these suggestions, once implemented, would enable the township to expand its paddy fields by 30,000 mu.

This year, the number of voters participating in elections in various regions is generally higher than the proportion in the previous election. According to statistics from 1,287 grassroots units in twenty-one provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shandong, Henan, and Beijing, the number of participants in the election accounted for 92.9% of the total number of voters. The number of people deprived of the right to vote has also been greatly reduced compared with the first general election. According to statistics from 1,048 grassroots units in sixteen provinces and cities, including Hebei, Liaoning, and Qinghai, the number of people deprived of the right to vote accounted for 0.48% of the total population. In Shanxi Province, according to preliminary statistics from twenty-seven counties including Luan, Shouyang, and Wuzhai, 81.5% of landlords and rich peasants have changed their class status and participated in the election, and more than half of the controlled elements who have shown better performance in accepting reform have had their control revoked and were granted political rights.

According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People's Republic of China, this year some areas also have an insufficient understanding of the major political significance of grassroots elections. They did not promote democracy well in the election process and simply rushed to meet the deadline and complete the task, resulting in the election work becoming a mere formality. These areas have taken emergency measures to conduct inspections and make corrections in order to correct deviations and resolve legacy issues in the elections.

    参加选举的人数高于上届选举时的比例
    十九个省市全部完成基层选举
    有些地区正采取紧急措施纠正偏差和解决遗留问题
    新华社27日讯　1956年的基层选举工作即将结束。目前，已有吉林、内蒙古、陕西、湖南、贵州、北京等十九个省（区）、市全部完成了基层选举工作，正在普遍召开第二届县、市人民代表大会第一次会议。其他各省（区）的基层选举工作也即将在最近结束。
    在选举过程中，许多地区充分发扬了民主，广泛地发动群众对政府工作和干部作风展开批评，并且严格地挑选了代表候选人，因而在选举后出现了新的气象。河北省秦皇岛市铁庄乡经过选民酝酿讨论后确定的候选人名单，在再一次拿到群众中讨论时，在四十七名候选人中又有六名被群众提出意见，要求更换，直到提出大家最满意的人为止。内蒙古自治区喀喇沁旗平庄乡在选举后的半个月中，就有三十多名代表主动到乡人民委员会来反映群众的意见和要求。重庆市道角乡人民代表杨金华过去对群众的生活不够关心，在选举中群众向他提了许多意见，他当选后根据群众意见改进了工作方法和工作作风，及时了解了九十三户生活困难的社员的情况，并且提出了减免公粮和给予生活补助等具体意见转人民委员会处理。在选举后举行的人民代表大会会议和人民委员会会议一般都较过去开得好，克服了过去的形式主义的毛病。例如，青海省湟源县申中乡在举行人民代表大会会议时，广泛发扬了民主，代表们在会上对政府工作和干部作风提出了七十条批评和建议。其中有一条建议实现后，就可以使这个乡扩大水田三万亩。
    今年各地参加选举的选民人数一般都高于上届选举时的比例。据山西、黑龙江、甘肃、山东、河南、北京等二十一个省、市的一千二百八十七个基层单位的统计，参加选举的人数占选民总数的92.9％。被剥夺选举权利的人数也比第一次普选时大为减少，据河北、辽宁、青海等十六个省、市的一千零四十八个基层单位的统计，被剥夺选举权的人占总人口的0.48％。在山西省，据潞安、寿阳、五寨等二十七个县的初步统计，在地主、富农中有81.5％改变了成分参加了选举，有半数以上接受改造表现较好的被管制分子撤销了管制，给予他们政治权利。
    据中华人民共和国内务部消息，今年也有一些地区对基层选举的重大政治意义认识不足，在选举过程中没有很好发扬民主，单纯地赶时间、赶任务，致使选举工作流于形式。这些地区为了纠正偏差和解决选举中的遗留问题，已经采取紧急措施进行检查和纠正。
