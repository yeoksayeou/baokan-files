    Cooperation of This Kind
    Huang Yu
    On December 11, the Swiss Federal Council (Upper House) approved a ten-year atomic energy cooperation agreement signed between Switzerland and the United States. This agreement was signed by the two countries on June 21 of this year. Because this agreement infringed upon Swiss sovereignty and interests, it was strongly opposed by Swiss public opinion, so much so that the Swiss Federal Council's autumn session failed to make a decision after a long period of discussion, and it was shelved until the recently held winter session before it was passed. The agreement will soon be submitted to the National Council (Lower House) for discussion. Reuters estimates that it will encounter considerable difficulties in obtaining approval from the National Council.
    After the 1955 Geneva International Atomic Energy Conference, the United States concluded agreements with thirty countries to supply atomic reactors. The U.S.-Swiss agreement on atomic energy cooperation is the first agreement concluded by the United States with a foreign country for the industrial use of atomic energy. According to this agreement, the United States will sell atomic energy equipment and machinery to Switzerland and will successively sell to Switzerland a total of 500 kilograms of uranium-235 and a certain amount of other fissionable materials within ten years. However, Switzerland's acquisition of atomic energy equipment and fissionable materials from the United States is subject to harsh conditions. The United States will have the right to send personnel to inspect, supervise, and conduct measurements independently; it will have the right to obtain and use all inventions made by Switzerland based on U.S. atomic energy intelligence. The agreement also stipulates that the fissionable materials supplied by the United States to Switzerland are of a leased nature, and these fissionable materials, after being used, as well as the special fissionable materials produced during their use, should be returned to the United States or an institution agreed to by the United States.
    It is easy to see that this agreement is a typical example of an unequal treaty in international atomic energy cooperation. After this agreement was announced, it attracted international attention and criticism from Swiss public opinion. The "Lausanne Gazette" believes that the Swiss authorities' granting of privileges to the United States in the treaty is not in line with Switzerland's neutral policy. Because according to the agreement, the United States not only controls Switzerland in the peaceful use of atomic energy, but also prevents Switzerland from cooperating with other countries in this regard. The "Swiss Daily" pointed out that the agreement was signed under "humiliating conditions" and is therefore unacceptable. The "Lausanne Forum" said it more thoroughly, writing: "When foreign representatives supervise and inspect Switzerland's factories, laboratories, and reactors, our sovereignty will no longer be fully respected." Even the Speaker of the Swiss Federal Council, Weber, publicly stated that it would not work if the United States insisted on sending police-like personnel to monitor Switzerland. "New York Times" correspondent Hoffman in Geneva said in his comprehensive report on the reactions of all parties in Switzerland to this agreement: Many Swiss people are worried that "this agreement will harm Switzerland's historical neutrality or make Switzerland's economy subordinate to American power."
    Switzerland's agreement to conclude this unequal agreement is mainly due to the demands of Swiss big entrepreneurs, especially power industry capitalists. Their reason is that Switzerland lacks power fuel resources, and coal is almost entirely dependent on imports; while power machinery is the main commodity in Switzerland's machinery exports (accounting for one-fifth of Switzerland's machinery exports in 1955). After the development of atomic power machinery in various countries, Swiss power machinery will be "eliminated." Therefore, as early as 1954, capitalist entrepreneurs, led by large enterprises such as the Swiss B, B, C power plant, established a joint enterprise "Reactor Company" to use atomic energy for industry. The following year, Switzerland signed a contract with the United States to purchase an experimental reactor. One of the two representatives sent by the Swiss government to the United States to assist in the negotiations, Walter Boveri, is the chairman of this atomic reactor company. The Swiss government's memorandum to the parliament on July 31 also clearly shows the aspirations of Swiss entrepreneurs. The memorandum mentioned that the agreement is "in line with the ardent wishes of Swiss industry," and the government is only an "intermediary between Swiss users and the U.S. government."
    The issue of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy is a matter of deep concern not only for Switzerland but also for people all over the world. The widespread use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes is what the people of all countries in the world, especially the people of economically backward countries lacking power resources, urgently desire. The current demand of the people of all countries in the world is that international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy should be based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Only in this way can it truly be conducive to promoting the development of the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    如此合作
    黄予
    瑞士联邦院（上院）12月11日批准了瑞士同美国签订的一项为期十年的原子能合作协定。这项协定是两国在今年6月21日签订的。由于这一协定侵害了瑞士的主权和利益，曾遭到瑞士舆论的强烈反对，以致瑞士联邦院今年的秋季会议经过长时期的讨论而未能作出决定，一直搁置到最近举行的冬季会议才予以通过。这个协定不久将送交民族院（下院）讨论。据路透社估计，它要获得民族院的批准，还会遇到不少困难。
    美国在1955年日内瓦国际原子能会议后，曾同三十个国家缔结了供应原子反应堆的协定，而美国瑞士关于原子能的合作协定是美国同外国缔结的第一个将原子能用于工业的协定。根据这项协定，美国将售与瑞士原子能装备和机械，并在十年内陆续售与瑞士总数等于五百公斤的铀235和一定数量的其他可分裂物质。而瑞士从美国获取原子能装备和可分裂物质是附有苛刻的条件的。美国将有权派遣人员视察、监督和单独进行测量；有权取得和使用瑞士在美国原子能情报的基础上进行研究而作出的一切发明。协定并规定美国供应瑞士的可分裂物质是租赁性质的，这些可分裂物质经使用后，以及它在使用过程中所产生的特种分裂物质应交回美国或美国同意的机构。
    很容易看得出，这个协定是原子能国际合作中的一个不平等契约的典型例子。这一协定公布后，曾引起国际人士的注视和瑞士舆论的非议。“洛桑日报”认为瑞士当局在条约中给予美国以特权是不符合瑞士的中立政策的。因为美国根据协定不仅在和平利用原子能方面使瑞士受它的控制，而且还妨碍了瑞士同其他国家在这方面进行合作。“瑞士日报”指出协定是在“屈辱的条件下”签订的因而是不能接受的。“洛桑论坛报”说得更为透彻，它写道：“当外国代表对瑞士的工厂、实验室和反应堆进行监督和视察时，我们的主权就再也不是完整地受到尊重的了。”连瑞士联邦院议长魏伯尔也曾公开表示，如果美国要坚持派遣警察似的人员来监视瑞士，那是行不通的。驻日内瓦的“纽约时报”记者霍夫曼在他关于瑞士各方面对这一协定的反应的综合报道中说：许多瑞士人士担心“这项协定会伤害瑞士的历史性的中立，或者使瑞士的经济从属于美国的势力。”
    瑞士同意缔结这项不平等的协定，主要是出于瑞士大企业家特别是动力工业资本家的要求。他们的理由是瑞士缺乏动力燃料资源，煤炭几乎全部仰赖进口；而动力机械是瑞士机械出口中的主要货物（占1955年瑞士机械出口的五分之一），在各国原子动力机械发达后，瑞士动力机械就将被“淘汰”。因此早在1954年，以瑞士B、B、C电厂等大企业为首的企业资本家就成立了一个将原子能用于工业的联合企业“反应堆公司”，第二年瑞士同美国签订了购买一座试验性反应堆的合同。这次瑞士政府派往美国协助谈判的两个代表之一华特·波华利就是这一原子反应堆公司的董事长。关于瑞士企业家的这种企求，在7月31日瑞士政府致议会的咨文中也可明显地看出。该咨文提到：协定是“符合瑞士工业界的热烈愿望的”，政府只是“瑞士的使用者与美国政府间的中间人”而已。
    关于原子能的和平利用的国际合作问题，不仅是瑞士而且是全世界人士所深为关切的问题。广泛地把原子能用于和平目的是世界各国人民，特别是经济落后、动力资源缺乏国家的人民所迫切企求的。当前世界各国人民的要求是：和平利用原子能的国际合作，应当建立在平等互利的原则上。只有这样才能真正有利于促进原子能和平利用的发展。
