Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 14th (Xinhua reporter Zhang Feng): Shanghai is systematically conducting policy education, with the promotion of the redemption policy as its main content, among the 600,000-plus workers of the newly joint state-private enterprises. Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, has already given a report to more than 13,000 joint state-private enterprise cadres outlining the requirements for this propaganda and education work. The Party organizations and trade union organizations at the municipal and district levels have drawn a large number of cadres, organized them to first conduct special studies, and then have them give study reports to the masses of workers. In the industrial areas of Hudong and Husi, and the commercial areas of the city center, thousands of workers are now participating in lessons or discussions in their spare time every day.

Originally, some workers were not clear enough about the spirit of the redemption policy, believing that peaceful transformation was making it too easy for capitalists. In addition to explaining the rationale for implementing the redemption policy to the workers, some units also specifically analyzed the situation of the private individuals in their own enterprises to allow the masses of workers to see whether the implementation of the redemption policy was beneficial to the working class. For example, Changning District counted twenty factories. Among the ninety-five private individuals in these factories, seventy-nine had technical or management abilities, thirteen had already directly participated in production, and among the ninety-five, those who actively accepted transformation and worked hard accounted for 44%, those with generally good performance accounted for 42%, and only a very small number of private individuals were relatively backward. From these concrete facts, everyone understood that adopting the redemption policy was beneficial to the working class, as it could give play to the enthusiasm of private individuals and enable them to serve the cause of socialist construction.

Another important aspect of this policy propaganda is to educate workers to correctly understand the principle of gradually improving living standards and welfare on the basis of developing production, and to advocate a spirit of hard work and simplicity. Many units have summarized and announced the projects where living standards and welfare have already improved this year, and have also prioritized the demands of the workers. Those that can be implemented are being implemented, and those that are currently difficult to achieve are also being explained to the workers.

    上海市向职工宣传赎买政策
    据新华社上海14日电　新华社记者张风报道：上海市正在六十多万新合营企业职工中有系统地进行以宣传赎买政策为主要内容的政策教育。中共上海市委员会书记曹荻秋已经向一万三千多合营工作干部作了关于这次宣传教育工作的要求的报告。市、区的中共组织和工会组织都抽调大量干部，组织他们先作专题学习，再由他们向职工群众作学习报告。在沪东、沪西的工业区和市中心的商业区，现在每天都有成千上万的职工在业余参加听课或讨论。
    原来有些职工对赎买政策的精神不够清楚，认为和平改造是便宜了资本家。这次除了向职工讲清楚实行赎买政策的道理之外，有的单位还具体分析本企业私方人员的情况，让职工群众看到实行赎买政策是否对工人阶级有利。例如长宁区统计了二十个厂，这些厂的九十五个私方人员中，有七十九人具有技术或管理的能力，十三人已经直接参加了生产，九十五人中积极接受改造和努力工作的占44％，一般表现还好的占42％，只有极少数私方人员比较落后。从这些具体事实中，大家弄通了采取赎买政策对工人阶级有利，这样做能够发挥私方人员积极性，使他们为社会主义建设事业服务。
    这次政策宣传的另一项重要内容，是教育职工正确认识在发展生产的基础上逐步改善生活福利的原则和提倡艰苦朴素作风。很多单位都总结和公布了今年以来生活福利上已经改善的项目，并且把职工的要求进行排队，有条件实行的采纳实行，目前难以办到的也向职工讲清楚。
