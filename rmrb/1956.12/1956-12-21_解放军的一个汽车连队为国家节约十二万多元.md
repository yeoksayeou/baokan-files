Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 19th. A certain motor vehicle company, the Fourth Company, of the People's Liberation Army's motor transport unit, has saved the state wealth worth over 127,000 yuan while completing arduous transportation tasks. They have received a circular commendation from the leadership of their affiliated unit.

During the three and a half years from April 1953 to October this year, this motor vehicle company, braving raids by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft and scorching winds and rain, crossing countless high mountains and rivers, and overcoming numerous difficulties, safely traveled a total of 2,101,700 kilometers, transporting a large quantity of materials intact. At the same time, all personnel of the company have consistently maintained a style of diligence and frugality, meticulously calculating everything to save the state every bit. By the end of October this year, they had saved a total of 38,414 kilograms of gasoline, 3,910 kilograms of lubricating oil, eighteen tires, and four inner tubes, and saved more than 76,860 yuan in small repair and maintenance costs for vehicles.

The drivers of this motor vehicle company have made many arduous efforts to protect vehicles and save fuel and materials. They often adhere to the principles of "three firsts" (slow first, yield first, stop first), "five slows" (slow when turning corners, slow when entering cities and towns, slow when encountering people, animals, and vehicles, slow at bridges and ferries, slow when going up and down hills), and "four no-overtakings" (no overtaking on narrow roads, no overtaking at bridges and ferries, no overtaking when turning corners, no overtaking if the vehicle in front does not allow it). They strictly implement the vehicle maintenance system, and even during tense and busy transportation tasks, they diligently perform scheduled maintenance on time, ensuring that the vehicles are always in good technical condition. In terms of fuel conservation, they have successfully adopted the advanced experience of Lu Yaowen, a special-class merit recipient and motor vehicle driver of the Chinese People's Volunteers, in saving fuel.

    解放军的一个汽车连队为国家节约十二万多元
    新华社福建前线19日电　中国人民解放军汽车部队某部第四连在完成繁重的运输任务中，为国家节省了价值十二万七千多元的财富。他们受到所属部队领导机关的通令嘉奖。
    这个汽车连队从1953年4月到今年10月的三年半中，冒着蒋军飞机的袭扰和炎风暑雨，越过无数高山大河，战胜了重重困难，共安全行驶二百一十万一千七百多公里，运输的大量物资完好无损。同时，全连人员始终保持勤俭节约的作风，处处精打细算，点滴为国家节省。到今年10月底，他们共节约了汽油三万八千四百一十四公斤，附属油类三千九百一十公斤，汽车外胎十八条、内胎四条，并节省汽车小修理保养费七万六千八百六十多元。
    这个汽车连的驾驶员在爱护车辆和节约油料、材料方面，作了很多艰辛的努力。他们在行车中经常遵守“三先”（先慢、先让、先停）、“五慢”（转弯抹角慢、进城市乡镇慢、遇到人畜车马慢、桥梁渡口慢、上下山坡慢）和“四不超”（路窄不超、桥梁渡口不超、转弯抹角不超、前车不允许不超）等规则。他们严格地贯彻车辆保养制度，即使在紧张繁忙的运输任务中，也不顾劳累地按时进行定程保养，保证车辆经常处于良好的技术状态。在油料节约方面，他们成功地采用了中国人民志愿军特等功臣、汽车驾驶员卢耀文节约油料的先进经验。
