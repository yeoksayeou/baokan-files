Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 6th: The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Neijiang County Committee in Sichuan Province has recently taken measures to reduce the excessive number and size of year-end meetings in order to save expenses and concentrate efforts on leading winter production.

After entering the latter part of November, many units in Neijiang County felt that they had a relatively large surplus of operating funds for the year, and if these funds were not spent, they would have to be turned over at the end of the year. As a result, some units planned to hold some unnecessary or oversized meetings. For example, the county's agriculture and water conservancy departments, in order to arrange current production and water conservancy work, could have resolved the issues in one or two meetings, but after convening the "Water Conservancy Cadre Meeting" and the "Reservoir Work Cadre Meeting," they also planned to hold "Slope Land to Terraces Cadre Meeting," "Land Processing Cadre Meeting," "Sugarcane Seed Retention Cadre Meeting," and "Sweet Potato Seed Retention Cadre Meeting" in the near future. The county education section could have held a meeting of several hundred anti-illiteracy activists to summarize and arrange rural anti-illiteracy work, but the section recently planned to expand this meeting to two thousand people, extending the meeting period to ten days. According to statistics, the county-level agencies in Neijiang County originally planned to convene and hold more than twenty large-scale meetings and training classes in November and December.

After discovering this situation, the CCP Neijiang County Committee, on November 22nd, in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, and opposing bureaucracy, convened a meeting of the heads of party organizations of county-level agencies to conduct a special inspection and study of this issue. They also put forward instructions to the county-level agencies and district and township party organizations to change their leadership style, reduce meetings, and free up time to lead production. According to the instructions of the county party committee, the party organizations of the county-level agencies rearranged the meetings and training classes originally scheduled to be held before the end of the year: those that must be held will still be held as planned; those that can be merged will be merged; those that can be canceled will be resolutely canceled; and those whose scale can be reduced will also be resolutely reduced. For example, some of the meetings originally planned to be held in December by the departments under the CCP County Committee and the County People's Committee will no longer be held separately. The work tasks to be arranged will be centrally arranged at the expanded cadre meeting to be held in mid-December. The slope land to terraces cadre meeting, the land processing cadre meeting, and the sugarcane and sweet potato seed retention meetings of the agricultural and water conservancy departments have all been decided to be held jointly. The scale of the conferences and training courses to be held by the Education Section and the Public Security Bureau of the County People's Committee has been decided to be reduced by half, and the time will also be shortened. Some meetings that can be postponed will also be postponed.

### 内江县委决定减少过多过大的年终会议　集中力量领导冬季生产

　　内江县委决定减少过多过大的年终会议
　　集中力量领导冬季生产
    新华社成都6日电　中共四川省内江县委员会最近采取措施，减少年终过多过大的会议，以节约开支，集中力量领导冬季生产。
    进入11月下旬以后，内江县有不少单位认为今年的事业经费还有较多的剩余，如不开支掉，到年终就要上缴。于是，有些单位就计划召开一些不必要的或过大的会议。例如县农业、水利部门布置当前的生产和水利工作，本来在一两个会议上就可解决，但他们在召开了“水利干部会”、“水库工作干部会”之后，还计划在最近召开“坡土改梯土干部会”、“土地加工干部会”、“甘蔗留种保种干部会”、“红薯留种保种干部会”等。县教育科本来召开一个有几百人参加的扫盲积极分子会，就可总结和布置农村扫盲工作，但这个科最近却计划把这个会议扩大到两千人，会期延长到十天。据统计，内江县县级机关原计划在11、12月份召开和举办的大型会议和训练班，就有二十多个。
    中共内江县委员会发现这一情况后，在11月22日根据开展增产节约、反对官僚主义的精神，召集县级各机关单位党组织的负责人开会，对这一问题作了专门的检查和研究，并向县属机关和区、乡党组织提出了改变领导作风、减少会议，腾出手来领导生产的指示。县属各机关的党组织根据县委的指示，将原决定在年前召开的会议和训练班重新作了安排：对必须召开的仍按计划开；可以合并的就合并开；可以不开的坚决不开；规模可以缩小的也坚决缩小。如中共县委会和县人民委员会所属部门原计划在12月份召开的一些会议，已不再单独召开。所要布置的工作任务，将在12月中旬召开的扩大干部会上集中布置。农业水利部门的坡土改梯土干部会和土地加工干部会、甘蔗和红薯的留种保种会等，都决定合并举行。县人民委员会教育科和公安局要召开的大会和训练班的规模，已决定缩小一半，时间也要缩短。有些可以推迟的会议也将推迟进行。
