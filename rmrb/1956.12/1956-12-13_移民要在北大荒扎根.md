Xinhua News Agency, Harbin Electric Dispatch: In the eastern part of Baoqing County, Heilongjiang Province, 310 young and strong men from Henan Province came here this spring and established new immigrant villages. They have already reaped a bumper harvest on 865 hectares of newly reclaimed land. Generally, their annual income is close to 600 yuan, which is one to two times more than their previous income in Henan Province.

When these young men first arrived in the Great Northern Wilderness, they encountered the difficulty of not having firewood to burn, so they went up the mountains to collect firewood themselves. During the spring ploughing, there was a shortage of livestock, so they used manpower for sowing. During the summer hoeing season, there were torrential rains, and the farmland was full of water and overgrown with weeds, which seriously hindered the growth of crops. They braved the wind and rain to drain water and weed the fields, saving all the crops.

After a year of hard work, the new immigrant village now has a new look of "five mores": more land, more grain, more timber, more vegetables, and more fruits. People's lives have also been greatly improved. They want to settle down in the Great Northern Wilderness.

    移民要在北大荒扎根
    据新华社哈尔滨电　黑龙江省宝清县东部，今春，三百一十名河南省的青壮年来到了这里，在这里建立了移民新村。他们已经在八百六十五公顷新开垦的土地上获得了丰收。一般一年的收入都接近六百元，比过去在河南省的收入增加了一倍到两倍。
    这些青壮年刚到北大荒，就遇到没有柴烧的困难，他们就上山自己打柴。春耕时，牲畜缺乏，他们就用人力播种。到了夏锄期间，下了倾盆大雨，庄稼地里满是积水，荒草丛生，严重地防害了农作物的生长，他们就冒着风雨下地排水、锄草，挽救了全部庄稼。
    经过一年来的辛勤劳动，现在这个移民新村已经出现了土地多、粮食多、木材多、蔬菜多和水果多的“五多”新气象。人们的生活也大大改善了。他们要在北大荒扎根。
