Promote Advanced Experiences Realistically
　　Ji Fu
The Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's organization of the masses to evaluate advanced experiences is a very meaningful thing. It is of great benefit to overcoming blindness and formalism in the promotion of advanced experiences.

　　The reason why advanced experience is called advanced experience is, of course, that it has universal significance and is worthy of learning and emulation by others. However, there are no flowers without wood in the world. Any advanced experience is produced under certain specific technical conditions; because it is produced from specific conditions, it cannot be a panacea that can be used everywhere. The advanced experience of one industry may not be applicable to another industry, the advanced experience of one factory in the same industry may not be completely applicable to another factory, and the experience of enterprises with modern equipment is often not applicable to manual operations.... Therefore, in promoting advanced experience, it is necessary to consider specific conditions. In the process of promoting advanced experience, the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has carried out meticulous technical organization work, promoting only what is suitable for promotion and not forcing what is not suitable. This practice of promoting advanced experience from the actual production of the enterprise is realistic.

　　However, some factories promote advanced experience without starting from the specific situation of the factory. One type of person is like "Grandma Liu entering the Grand View Garden," learning whatever they see and hear with great enthusiasm. However, because they do not combine it with the specific situation of the factory, especially not with the key to production, the advanced experience, although good, does not have a great effect in promotion, and ultimately becomes formalism. The Nanjing Electric Power Bureau's Southern Jiangsu Office was like this for a period of time, learning 390 kinds of advanced experiences from various places and formulating four plans for promotion, instead of basing them on production requirements and their own specific conditions, resulting in most of them failing. Of course, attention should be paid to comprehensiveness in promoting advanced experience. In addition to grasping the key, appropriate attention should also be paid to auxiliary links. However, it must also be purposeful and based on the enterprise's production conditions and technical level.

　　There is also a type of person who, although grasping the key to promote advanced experience, copies it mechanically and swallows it whole. The Kailuan Coal Mine's Zhaogezhuang Mine was like this when promoting the one-shift coal mining system. The one-shift coal mining system itself is superior, but it has high and strict requirements, especially requiring a considerable transportation capacity. When the conditions are not met, blind promotion will inevitably be ineffective. The Zhaogezhuang Mine did not study the specific conditions of the mine and promoted it universally. As a result, only a few faces with complete conditions received good results and improved mining efficiency. Most of the faces failed. For example, the 6898 face produced more than 800 tons per day, but the transportation capacity was only 500 to 600 tons. The promotion of the one-shift coal mining system resulted in the inability to transport coal out in time, causing frequent overtime, loss of coal, and a chaotic scene, which was not as good as the original two-shift coal mining system.

　　Seeking truth from facts is the secret to doing all work well. Promoting advanced experience is no exception. If every factory treats the work of promoting advanced experience in the same way as the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the factory's production efficiency will inevitably continue to improve.

### 实事求是地推广先进经验

    实事求是地推广先进经验
    纪夫
    太原机车车辆修理工厂组织群众对先进经验进行鉴定，是一件很有意义的事情，它对于克服推广先进经验中盲目性和形式主义大有好处。
    先进经验之称为先进经验，当然是具有普遍意义，有值得别人学习、仿效的地方。但是，世界上没有无木之花。任何先进经验都是在一定的具体技术条件下产生的；因为它是从具体条件下产生的，就不可能是万灵药膏，可以到处搬用。这一行业的先进经验就不见得适用于另一行业，同行业中这一个厂的先进经验就不一定完全适用于那一个厂，现代化设备的企业的经验常常不适用于手工作业……。因此，在推广先进经验的时候，一定要考虑到具体条件。太原机车车辆修理工厂在推广先进经验中，进行了细致的技术组织工作，适合推广的才推广，不适合推广的就不勉强推广。这种从本企业的生产实际出发推广先进经验的作法是实事求是的。
    可是，也有一些工厂推广先进经验，不从本厂的具体情况出发。其中一种人像“刘姥姥进了大观园”，看到什么、听到什么就学什么，热情很高，可是由于没有结合本厂的具体情况，特别是没有结合生产关键，结果先进经验虽好，推广的效果不大，终成形式主义。南京电业局苏南办事处前一段时间就是这样的，到各地去学了三百九十多种先进经验，订了四个计划推广，而不是根据生产要求和自己的具体情况，结果大多落空。当然，推广先进经验要注意全面，除了抓关键外，也要适当注意辅助性的环节。但是，也一定是有目的的，是从本企业的生产条件、技术水平出发的。
    还有一种人，虽然抓住了关键推广先进经验，但是生搬硬套，囫囵吞枣。开滦煤矿赵各庄矿推广一班采煤制时就是这样的。一班采煤制本身是优越的，但是要求很高，很严，特别是要求有相当高的运输能力，条件不具备时，盲目推广必难收效。赵各庄矿不研究本矿的具体条件，就普遍推广起来。结果只有少数条件齐备的掌子收到了好效果，提高了回采效率，大多数掌子都失败了，如六八九八掌子日产八百多吨，而运输能力仅五、六百吨，推广一班采煤制结果不能及时把煤运出去，造成经常加班加点，丢了煤，现场弄得很混乱，反而不如原先的两班采煤制强。
    实事求是是做好一切工作的秘诀。推广先进经验也不例外。如果各个工厂都像太原机车车辆修理工厂一样来对待推广先进经验的工作，工厂的生产效率必能不断提高。
