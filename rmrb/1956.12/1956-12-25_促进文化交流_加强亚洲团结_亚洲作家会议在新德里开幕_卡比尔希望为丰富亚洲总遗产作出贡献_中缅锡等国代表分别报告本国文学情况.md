Kabir's Welcome Address

In his welcoming address to the delegates, Kabir said that holding the Asian Writers' Conference at this time was very meaningful. He said that today, Asian writers are gathering in a spirit of equality, freedom, and brotherhood, and the new revival of the Asian spirit makes the conference even more significant.

Kabir hoped that Asian writers would make every effort to contribute to enriching the common Asian heritage.

Also speaking at the opening ceremony were the heads of various national delegations, as well as observers from Australia, Britain, Guatemala, Hungary, Romania, Sweden, the United States, and Finland.

Mao Dun's Speech

In his speech, Mao Dun congratulated the convening of the conference. He said that a new Asia has stood up like a giant and appeared on the stage of world history. The people of Asia hope to promote friendship among the people of all countries, develop cultural exchanges, and strive to increase human happiness on the basis of Panchsheel.

Mao Dun said that we firmly believe that the aspirations of Asian writers are the same as the aspirations of the people of all countries. He concluded by saying: Chinese writers will do everything in their power to ensure the success of the Asian Writers' Conference and will strive for the unity of Asian and world writers.

U Thein Pe Myint's Speech

U Thein Pe Myint, head of the Burmese delegation, said that Asian writers participating in this conference must face their problems in the spirit of Asian unity and undifferentiated respect and importance for various cultures. He ended his speech by shouting: Seek world peace through Asian unity!

Ahmed Faiz's Speech

The delegates warmly welcomed the speech of Ahmed Faiz, head of the Pakistani delegation. Faiz said that peace and freedom are the heartfelt desires of the vast majority of Asian people and Asian writers. He said that Asian writers must first unite themselves in order to serve the great cause of freedom and peace.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 24th: The Asian Writers' Conference held a plenary session on the afternoon of December 23rd, presided over by Mao Dun, head of the Chinese Writers' Delegation.

Anand's Report

Mulk Raj Anand, Secretary-General of the Conference, gave a report to the conference on behalf of the Secretariat. He said that cultural exchanges between Asian countries have been strengthened in the past few years, but the language barrier and the lack of contact between Asian writers are still deeply felt, so the significance of this conference is significant. He hoped that the discussions at this conference will broaden the horizons of Asian writers and expand the horizons of the rising Asia.

At the meeting, Mao Dun proposed a motion to express gratitude to the Indian government and Indian friends for their support to the conference during the preparatory period. This motion was greeted with cheers from all the delegates in the conference hall.

Report by Chinese Representative

The plenary session also heard a report by Mao Dun on "Today's Chinese Literature." He pointed out that one of the basic principles of Chinese literature is to cherish national traditions, including the cultural traditions of minority nationalities. In his report, Mao Dun traced the history of the development of Chinese literature at different stages. He said that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the development of Chinese literature has had significant characteristics. First of all, Chinese writers have had more extensive contact with life than before, which enables them to truthfully write about social changes and works directly related to the lives of the people. Amateur writers are also unprecedentedly active.

Mao Dun also talked about the large number of Indian, Japanese, and other European and Asian literary works translated in China.

When talking about the shortcomings of Chinese literature, Mao Dun said that its level still has much room for improvement. The themes of most new works talk about war, agriculture, and industrial construction, but neglect other aspects of people's lives.

He concluded by saying that the slogan of Chinese writers today is "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." There is no doubt that this will help our new literature progress.

Reports by Burmese and Ceylonese Representatives

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing of the Burmese delegation and G.P.V.S. de Silva of the Ceylonese delegation gave reports on the literary situations in Burma and Ceylon, respectively. Thakin Kodaw Hmaing pointed out that colonial rule had a great influence on Burmese literature because "our studies of our own culture and literature were hindered." What preserved the Burmese cultural heritage were the Buddhist monasteries, the national movement of 1938-39, and the general strike. This national movement and general strike proved to be a turning point in the Burmese cultural revolution.

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing said that the two problems currently facing Burmese literature are artistic standards and popularization. The influence of Western commercialism and thrillers still exists. The range of Burmese readers is still very narrow. He said: "The solution to this problem depends to a large extent on the improvement of the general education of the people, and the education problem is very much in need of urgent and large-scale national assistance."

G.P.V.S. de Silva of Ceylon said in his report on the influence of foreign rule that "it is unfair to expect a country that has been under foreign bondage for nearly four hundred years to produce modern literature." G.P.V.S. de Silva said that in the past fifty years, there have been new aspects in Ceylonese literature, which are novels, short stories, plays, narrative poems, and literary criticism.

    茅盾的讲话
    茅盾在讲话中祝贺这次会议的召开，他说，新的亚洲已经像巨人一样站立了起来，出现在世界历史的舞台上。亚洲人民希望在潘查希拉的基础上促进所有国家人民之间的友谊，发展文化交流，并且努力增进人类的幸福。
    茅盾说，我们深信，亚洲作家的愿望是与各国人民的愿望相同的。他最后表示：中国的作家们将尽一切力量求得亚洲作家会议的胜利成功，并且为亚洲及全世界的作家的团结而努力。
    吴登佩密的讲话

    新华社新德里24日电　亚洲作家会议23日下午在中国作家代表团团长茅盾的主持下举行了全体会议。
    阿南德的报告
    大会秘书长穆尔克·拉志·阿南德代表秘书处向大会作了报告。他说，亚洲国家之间的文化交流在过去几年中已经获得了加强，可是语言的障碍和亚洲作家之间接触的不够仍然深深为人所感觉得到，因此这次会议的意义是重大的。他希望这次会议的讨论将会扩大亚洲作家们的视野，扩大正在兴起的亚洲的视野。
    会上，茅盾提出了关于对印度政府和印度朋友们在会议筹备期间给予会议的支持表示感谢的动议。这个动议受到了会议厅全体代表们的欢呼。
    中国代表的报告
    全体会议还听取了茅盾关于“今天的中国文学”的报告。他指出：中国文学的基本原则之一是珍视民族传统，包括少数民族的文化传统在内。茅盾在报告中追述了中国文学在不同阶段的发展历史。他说，在中华人民共和国成立后，中国文学的发展具有重大的特点。首先，中国作家们同生活有了比以前更加广泛的接触，这就使他们能够真实地写出社会的变革，写出同人民生活直接有关的作品。业余作家也空前积极。
    茅盾还谈到在中国翻译出的大量印度、日本和其他欧亚国家的文学作品。
    在谈到中国文学的缺点的时候，茅盾说，它的水平仍然有很多可以提高的余地，大多数新作品的主题谈到战争、农业和工业建设，但是忽视了人民生活的其他方面。
    他最后说，中国作家今天的口号是“百花齐放、百家争鸣”。毫无疑问，这将有助于我们的新文学进步。
    缅甸、锡兰代表的报告
    缅甸代表团的德贡达耶和锡兰代表团的加雅蒂拉卡分别在会上作了关于缅甸和锡兰文学情况的报告。德贡达耶指出，殖民统治对缅甸文学有很大影响，因为“我们对自己的文化和文学的研究受到了阻挠”。保存了缅甸文化遗产的是佛教寺院，1938-39年的民族运动和总罢工。这次民族运动和总罢工证明是缅甸文化革命的转捩点。
    德贡达耶说，缅甸文学目前面临的两个问题是艺术标准和通俗化。西方的商业主义和惊险小说的影响仍然存在。缅甸读者的范围仍然是很狭窄的。他说：“这个问题的解决在很大程度上有赖于人民的一般教育的提高，而教育问题非常需要国家的紧急而大量的援助。”
    锡兰的加雅蒂拉卡在报告中谈到外国统治的影响时说，“希望一个处在外国束缚下将近四百年的国家产生现代文学是不公平的”。加雅蒂拉卡说，在过去五十年中，锡兰文学中有了新的方面，这些新方面是小说，短篇小说，剧本，叙事诗和文学批评。
