    Unauthorized Purchase of Timber Should Not Be Allowed

    Since the opening of the free market in Xinyang City, Henan Province, some units have been purchasing timber at high prices in the market, creating a chaotic situation in the timber market. The Xinyang Railway Second Construction Team purchased more than 500 raw logs in the market at more than 44 yuan per cubic meter (the timber company's purchase price was more than 37 yuan per cubic meter); they purchased more than 2,000 rafters at 79 yuan per cubic meter (the timber company's purchase price was more than 55 yuan per cubic meter). The Xinyang Textile Branch signed a timber purchase contract with the Madian Agricultural Cooperative in the 14th District of Xinyang and has already purchased more than 200 logs of timber at more than 51 yuan per cubic meter, which is 44% higher than the timber company's purchase price. The Xinyang City Cinema, Construction Company, Aquatic Products Company, and May 3rd Farm are also raising prices to purchase timber in the market.

    After the opening of the free market, the Huaixin Cooperative of Shuangji Township in the 11th District of Xinyang also opened a timber shop in the city. They first purchased timber in the timber-producing areas, and then transported it back to the shop for self-sale, with selling prices higher than state-owned sales prices.

    The arbitrary purchase and sale of timber by these units in the market has very bad consequences. Some forestry farmers, disliking the low purchase price of the timber company, are unwilling to sell their timber to the state. The Xinyang Timber Branch had originally signed 300 contracts with agricultural cooperatives, but all of them have been returned.

    Timber is a material that must be controlled by the state and cannot be freely bought and sold. The relevant departments in Xinyang City should pay attention to and solve the problem of arbitrarily raising prices to purchase timber. Li Chunren

    不能允许擅自购买木材
    河南省信阳市自从自由市场开放以后，有些单位就拿高价在市场上抢购木材，造成木材市场的混乱状态。信阳铁路第二基建队，在市场上收购元木五百余根，每立方公尺四十四元多（木材公司收购价每立方公尺三十七元多）；收购椽子二千余匹，每立方公尺七十九元（木材公司收购价每立方公尺五十五元多）。信阳纺织品分公司同信阳十四区马店农业社签订了木材收购合同，现已收购了二百多根木材，每立方公尺五十一元多，高于木材公司收购价44％。信阳市电影院、建筑公司、水产公司、五三农场等单位，也在市场上抬价收购木材。
    在自由市场开放以后，信阳十一区双集乡淮新社也在市内开设了木料行。他们先在木材产地收购木材，以后运回行内自销，出售价格均高于国营销售价格。
    这些单位在市场上任意收购和销售木材，造成的后果是很坏的。有些林农，嫌木材公司收购价低，不愿把木材卖给国家。信阳木材分公司，原和农业社签订的三百份合同，也都已被退回去了。
    木材是必须由国家掌握而不可以自由买卖的物资。信阳市有关部门应该重视和解决随意抬价收购木材的问题。　李纯仁
