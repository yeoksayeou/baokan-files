    The "Difficult Hurdle" of Joining the League
    His history is clear,
    He's active in production, I'm aware of that;
    But he knows how to perform magic,
    He performed wonderfully at the party the other day.
    However, this always leaves me wondering:
    Could he have been involved with a reactionary secret society?
    Joining the League? That will have to be temporarily denied!
    As for him? His performance is indeed good,
    An advanced producer in the workshop,
    He even spoke at the conference,
    But there's a fly in the ointment,
    He loves to offer opinions, his biggest "shortcoming,"
    Approving his League membership would only add trouble for myself,
    His problem will have to be put aside for a few more days.
    In short, I patiently await his "transformation,"
    Hoping that one day he can have a good "performance."
    He wants to join the League too?
    Hey! A football fan!
    Just thinking about him makes me angry!
    I remember once on the field,
    Because I refused to play ball with him,
    He said I didn't act like a Youth League secretary.
    Isn't that attacking leadership? Truly hateful and infuriating!
    His shortcomings are extremely serious!
    His League membership application will have to be temporarily shelved.

### 入团“难关”

    入团“难关”
    他呀历史清楚，
    生产积极，这个我也有数；
    可就是会耍魔术，
    那次晚会上他可耍得精彩。
    可是，因此我总有个疑问：
    他可能参加过反动道会门。
    入团吗？那只好暂时不准！
    他吗？表现确是不错，
    车间的先进生产者，
    大会上他也上台讲过话，
    可就是有些美中不足，
    爱提意见，是他最大的“缺点”，
    批准他入团只是给自己增加麻烦，
    他的问题只好再搁几天。
    总之我耐心等待着他“转变”，
    希望他有一天能有好的“表现”。
    他也要入团？
    嘿！球迷！
    一提起他我就生气！
    记得有一次在球场上，
    为了我不肯和他一起打球，
    他就说我不像个青年团的书记。
    这不是打击领导？真是可恨可气！
    他的缺点十分严重！
    入团申请书只好给他暂时搁起。
