    Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: New York - United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld ordered the United Nations Emergency Force on December 3rd to prepare to take over Port Said "in the middle of the month."
    He issued this order after receiving notes from Britain and France regarding the withdrawal of troops from Egypt.
    Hammarskjöld's spokesperson said that the Secretary-General had instructed UN police force commander Burns to immediately contact British and French supreme commander Keightley "in order to work out with him arrangements for the complete and unhurried withdrawal of British and French forces."
    According to a United Press report, Secretary-General Hammarskjöld had previously agreed in principle to British and French participation in the salvage work to clear the Suez Canal, but he did not want to announce this publicly.

　　哈马舍尔德命令联合国部队
　　准备在月中接管塞得港
    据新华社4日讯　纽约消息：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德3日命令联合国紧急部队准备“在月中”接管塞得港。
    他是在接到英法的关于从埃及撤军的照会以后下这个命令的。
    哈马舍尔德的发言人说，秘书长已经指示联合国警察部队司令伯恩斯立刻同英法军最高司令凯特莱进行接触，“以便同他拟出关于英法部队毫不迟延地完全撤退的安排”。
    据合众社消息说，事先，联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德已经原则上同意了英法参加清理苏伊士运河的打捞工作，但是他不想公开宣布这一点。
    据国际新闻社说，这位联合国秘书长企图促使法齐同意在英法部队全部离开埃及以前就进行清理运河的工作。
