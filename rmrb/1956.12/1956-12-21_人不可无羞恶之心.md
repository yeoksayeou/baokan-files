Editor's Notes:

    People Must Have a Sense of Shame and Loathing

    Some people are wasting food, and some people are selling surplus grain. Those who waste food are so indifferent; those who sell surplus grain are so active and enthusiastic.

    Some people are rushing to buy pork, and some people are raising more pigs. Some cadres of certain units who eat pork specially supplied to them and still squeeze in among the citizens or send large trucks to the countryside to rush to buy pork are so unscrupulous; those who raise more pigs are so painstaking and devoted.

    When some people are wasting food, please let them think of the people who have diligently produced the grain and enthusiastically sold it to the state (including the Miao brothers in the deep mountains)!

    When some people are rushing around to buy pork at all costs in order to eat a few more mouthfuls, please let them think of the people who are racking their brains and overcoming all kinds of difficulties to strive for more pork production (including those who are still running around in the Great Northern Wilderness to build pig-raising bases in temperatures of minus thirty degrees)!

    In the face of people who are working selflessly, some people should feel ashamed.

    人不可无羞恶之心
    有人在浪费粮食，有人在多卖余粮。浪费粮食的人们是那么毫不在意；多卖余粮的人们是那么积极热情。
    有人在抢购猪肉，有人在多养生猪。吃了专门供应他们的猪肉还要挤到市民中间或者派了大卡车下乡抢购猪肉的某些单位的干部是那么肆无忌惮；多养生猪的人们是那么费力尽心。
    当有人在浪费粮食的时候，请他们想想辛勤地生产了粮食又热情地把粮食卖给国家的人们（包括深山里的苗家弟兄）吧！
    当有人在为了自己多吃几口猪肉而不顾一切地到处抢购的时候，请他们想想费尽心机、克服种种困难为更多生产猪肉而奋斗的人们（包括在零下三十多度的天气还在北大荒上奔波着建设养猪基地的人们）吧！
    在忘我地劳动的人们面前，有一些人应该感到羞愧。
