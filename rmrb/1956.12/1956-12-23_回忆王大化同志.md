    Remembering Comrade Wang Dahua
    Zhang Geng
    It has been ten years since Comrade Dahua died, but the impression he left on me is still so fresh. Every time I think of him, the image of an enthusiastic, lively, and talented, yet very people-oriented young artist immediately appears in my memory.
    Anyone who visited Yan'an after 1942 knew Wang Dahua. That was the time when the Yangko dance craze was at its peak, and Wang Dahua and Li Bo's performance of "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" caused a sensation in Yan'an. At that time, the people of Yan'an followed the Yangko troupe to watch Wang Dahua, one performance after another. Wang Dahua became a star among the people.
    The reason why "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" was so attractive was not only because it adopted the Yangko form familiar to the people of northern Shaanxi, but also because new characters and new lives appeared in this popular Yangko dance. This life and these characters existed among the people at that time. In the Yangko dance, people saw for the first time such cheerful and lively young farmers and rural girls, filled with a sense of being masters of their own destiny. This was not something false, but something that existed in the daily lives of the farmers, and was concentratedly expressed in art. This was both new and familiar to people, so they particularly loved it.
    This success was achieved through painstaking artistic labor such as exploration, correcting shortcomings, and repeated deliberation. At that time, Dahua was not very familiar with farmers, nor was he very familiar with Yangko performance. He relied on political and artistic enthusiasm to conduct tireless research to achieve it. It was after studying Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that the literary and art workers in Yan'an deeply felt their responsibility to create an art that was rich in Chinese style, loved by the people, and able to express the fiery lives of the people in their struggle, production, and learning at that time and place. Dahua was one of the young artists encouraged by this enthusiasm.
    Dahua was versatile. He created many roles in Yangko dramas. In addition to Wang Xiao'er in "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," he also played Zhao Fugui in "Zhao Fugui Reforming Himself," Zhang Pimo in "Zhang Pimo Eliminating Traitors," and Er Liuzi in "Good-for-nothing Becomes a Hero." He gradually solved the problem of portraying new characters and using Yangko dance and folk song singing to shape characters and perform dramas. Two things impressed me deeply: one was when he played "Zhang Pimo," he sang a passage when he appeared on stage:
    The setting sun burns the evening glow,
    Red-beaked crows fly in the sky,
    The groves in the ditches are dark and dense,
    The clear and bright flowing water,
    A good harvest of crops. I forget who wrote this passage, but it truly expresses the natural scenery of Yan'an. Dahua's singing of this passage can be said to be clear in pronunciation, round in tone, and even more rare, he sang with such affection for the homeland, with as much feeling as an old peasant singing a folk song. The other was the reclamation scene in "Good-for-nothing Becomes a Hero": Er Liuzi didn't want to work, felt pain in labor, but made up his mind and finally persevered. This passage was sung entirely in the Mei County "Five Watches Bird" tune. Dahua tried many rehearsals but it was always dull. Finally, he cleverly used the loose-tight rhythm of the "Five Watches Bird" to express the gradual transition of emotion from lazy to diligent, and finally gritted his teeth, knelt down and quickly waved the hoe off stage, winning excellent results. From these two examples, it can be seen how Dahua strived to learn and create forms that were loved by the people in order to express the most real and touching things in the new life.
    Dahua's most successful creation was the character of Ma Hongzhi in the land revolution historical drama "Bandit Zhou Zishan." This was a peasant leader, a positive character who stood in stark contrast to the traitor Zhou Zishan, and can also be said to be a difficult character to play. But Dahua played him with flesh and blood, vividly portraying a simple, sincere character who wholeheartedly engaged in revolution, placing personal interests completely out of consideration. This was a historical drama, and there was no way to directly experience life, but he used various methods to solve the difficulties. His success was achieved through hard work.
    To reward Dahua for his artistic achievements, he was awarded the title of First-Class Cultural and Educational Hero at the Border Region Cultural and Educational Conference in 1945. He was not at all proud, but became more humble and worked more tirelessly. In 1946, he went to the Northeast with the Northeast Art Troupe. At that time, the situation in the Northeast was difficult and complex. Some people were dazzled by entering the big cities for the first time, but Dahua and the comrades of the Art Troupe adhered to the style of hard work and simplicity, and did a lot of work in Shenyang, Dalian and other places. He always maintained a high prestige within the troupe. In the winter of that year, on the way to perform in the rural areas of Nehe, Dahua unfortunately lost his young life due to a car accident. He was not even thirty years old when he died.
    Dahua's death was a loss to the new drama cause. He was versatile, able to sing, dance, act, and direct. He also had certain accomplishments in music and fine arts. Most importantly, he was a communist party member of very good character. Especially after the rectification campaign, he hardly ever raised issues of personal interest. He was always enthusiastic about creative artistic work and motivated everyone to work together.
    It has been ten years since Dahua died. Literary and artistic work is no longer at the same scale and level as before. Now we are so urgently in need of talent and cadres. We really need not just one, but many, many comrades with Dahua's talent and character. Remembering him and looking back at his posthumous works, I feel that there are indeed many things we need to learn from him. First of all, his spirit of hard work and simplicity, and enthusiastic work, is what we need very much today.

    回忆王大化同志
    张庚
    大化同志死了十年了，但他在我脑子里的印象还是那么新鲜。每一念及他，一个热情、活泼、富有才气、但又非常群众化的青年艺术家的形象立刻显现在我的记忆中。
    1942年以后到过延安的人，没有不知道王大化的。那时正是闹秧歌闹得热火朝天的时候，王大化和李波两人的一出“兄妹开荒”轰动了延安：那时延安的老百姓跟着秧歌队看王大化，看了一场又一场。王大化成了老百姓中间的明星。
    “兄妹开荒”其所以如此吸引人，不仅是由于采取了陕北老百姓所熟悉的秧歌形式，而且是由于这种大家所喜闻乐见的秧歌中间出现了新的人物、新的生活；这种生活和人物正是存在在当时老百姓中间的。在秧歌中间，人们第一次看到了这样愉快活泼、充满了主人公感觉的青年农民和农村姑娘，这不是一种虚假的东西，而是农民生活中每天存在、而集中地表现在艺术中间的东西。这对人们又新鲜，又熟悉，所以他们特别热爱它。
    这一点成功，是经过摸索、改正缺点和反复推敲等辛勤的艺术劳动才得到的。那时的大化并不很熟悉农民，也不很熟悉秧歌的表演，他是凭着政治和艺术的热情进行了不疲倦的钻研才得来的。那正是学了毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”之后，延安的文艺工作者们深深感到自己的责任是要创造一种富于中国气派的、为老百姓所喜闻乐见的、能够表现当时当地人民的斗争、生产和学习的火热生活的艺术。大化就是为这种热情所鼓舞起来的青年艺术家之一。
    大化是多才多艺的，他在秧歌剧中创造了好些角色，除“兄妹开荒”中的王小二以外，还演过“赵富贵自新”中间的赵富贵，“张丕模除奸”中的张丕模，“二流子变英雄”中间的二流子等。他逐渐深入地解决着表现新人物的问题，运用秧歌舞蹈和民歌的演唱来塑造人物、表演戏剧的问题。有两件事情我的印象较深：一件是他演“张丕模”一出场唱了一段：
    日落西山红烧霞，
    天空里飞来了红嘴鸦，
    沟里的梢林黑压压，
    清格朗朗的流水，
    一片好庄稼。这段词忘了是谁写的，的确也表现了延安的自然景色。大化这一段唱真可说是字音清楚，声调圆润，更难得的是他唱得那么富于对乡土热爱的感情，像一个老百姓唱民歌那么有感情。另一件是他演“二流子变英雄”中的开荒一场：二流子不想劳动，对劳动感到痛苦，但又下了决心，终于坚持下去。这一段是整个用郿鄠“五更鸟”来唱的，大化经过了多次的试排总是枯燥无味，最后终于巧妙地运用了“五更鸟”前松后紧的节奏，表现出先懒后勤这一种情绪的逐渐转变，最后咬牙跪地快速地挥动镢头下场，博得了极好的效果。从这两个例子中可以看出大化是如何努力地学习和创造老百姓所喜闻乐见的形式，来表达新生活中最真实最感人的东西。
    大化最成功的创造是土地革命历史剧“惯匪周子山”中的马红志这个人物。这是一个农民领袖，是一个和叛徒周子山作鲜明对比的正面人物，也可以说是一个不好演的人物。但是大化把他演得有血有肉，很生动地表现出一个朴实诚恳、实心干革命，个人利益完全放在考虑之外的人物。这是个历史剧，没有法子直接体验生活，但他却用种种方法去解决困难。他的成功是经过艰苦劳动的。
    为了奖励大化在艺术上的成绩，1945年在边区文教大会上他被授予了一等文教英雄的称号。他没有任何骄傲，反而更加谦虚，更加孜孜不倦地工作。1946年他随东北文工团去东北。那时东北的情况又艰苦、又复杂，有的人新入大城市，眼花缭乱，但大化和文工团的同志们却坚持着艰苦朴素的作风，在沈阳、旅大等地做了许多工作。他在团中间一直保持着很高的威信。就在这年冬天，在去讷河农村演出的路上，大化不幸由于汽车失事，丧失了年轻的生命。死时还不到三十岁。
    大化的死，对于新的戏剧事业来说是一个损失。他多才多艺，能唱、能舞、能演、能导，对音乐和美术都有一定的素养。最难得的，他是一个品质非常好的共产党员，特别在整风以后，几乎没有闹过个人利益的问题，总是十分热情地进行创造性的艺术劳动，并且带动大家来工作。
    大化死了十年了，文艺工作已经完全不是从前的规模和水平了，现在我们多么迫切地需要人才和干部。像大化这样才能和品质的同志，我们真不只需要一个，而是要许许多多。回忆到他，翻翻他的遗作，觉得我们需要向他学习的地方真是不少，首先那种艰苦朴素，热情工作的精神，就是我们今天非常需要的。
