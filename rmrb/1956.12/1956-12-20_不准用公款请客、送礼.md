    No Public Funds Allowed for Feasting and Gift-Giving
    The Xiaogan Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Hubei Province has serious extravagance and waste in its administrative expenses. During the Spring Festival this year, they entertained more than 40 leading comrades and their families from local government agencies, military units, and other organizations, holding a grand banquet, leaders' dance, inviting them to the theater, and giving gifts to the leading comrades, spending a total of more than 670 yuan of public funds. What is particularly strange is that even Commissioner Fan's trip to Beijing for study in August, a common occurrence, was used as an excuse for entertainment, spending nearly 200 yuan more. In order to find sources of funds for entertainment, they even resorted to falsely reporting and claiming expenses, extending the duration of a cadre conference held in March from thirteen days to fifteen days.
    I suggest that relevant departments put an end to this phenomenon.　　　　　　Ye Zhi

    不准用公款请客、送礼
    湖北省孝感专署在行政管理费开支中存在着严重的铺张浪费的现象。今年春节招待当地机关、部队等单位的首长及其家属四十余人，举行盛大的聚餐、首长舞会，同时邀请看戏、给首长送礼，共开支公款六百七十多元。尤其令人奇怪的是，连8月间樊专员赴北京学习，这件普通的事情，也当作招待的借口，先后又用了近二百元。为了寻找招待钱的来源，他们甚至采取虚报冒领的办法，把3月召开的一次干部大会的会期，从十三天报为十五天。
    我建议有关部门制止这种现象。　　　　　　叶旨
