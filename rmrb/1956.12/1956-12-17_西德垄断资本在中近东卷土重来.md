    West German Monopoly Capital Makes a Comeback in the Middle East
    Wang Yu
    After Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal Company and Britain and France launched a war of aggression against Egypt, the West German government's attitude seemed outwardly to pretend not to be actively involved, but deep down it harbored a "sit on the mountain and watch the tigers fight" plan. Many bourgeois newspapers revealed that West German monopoly capital was clearly very pleased with the enormous difficulties and failures encountered by Britain and France in the Middle East. They believed that the difficult situation of Britain and France was a great opportunity for them to further penetrate the Middle East. Not long ago, the "Industrie-Kurier," the mouthpiece of the big bourgeoisie in the Ruhr area, wrote:
  "Under the current circumstances, the Middle Eastern countries are expecting other European exporting countries—especially the Federal Republic of Germany—to understand their economic difficulties even more than before... Now is the most favorable time for West Germany to conduct activities in the Middle East!"
    Behind this attitude of West German monopoly capital lies its obvious ambition to make a comeback in the Middle East, and it also reflects the deep contradictions between West German monopoly capital and the monopoly capital of Britain, France, and the United States in the Middle East.
    After World War II, the influence of German imperialism, which had a considerable influence in the Middle East, was temporarily expelled from the region. However, German monopoly capital has never given up its desire to rejoin the imperialist struggle for markets and raw materials in the Middle East, and has actively entered this struggle as it gradually recovered its economic strength. This added sharp contradictions between Britain and Germany and between the United States and Germany to the already tense Anglo-American contradictions in the struggle for raw materials and markets in the Middle East, making the relationship of open and secret struggles between imperialists in this region even more complicated.
    When West German monopoly capital rejoined the trade war in the Middle East, it relied on certain favorable conditions in technology and cost, and also cleverly used the anti-British and French colonial rule sentiments of the people of the Middle East after the war to take the opportunity to expand the sales of West German goods. In recent years, relying on this two-pronged approach of economy and politics, West Germany's trade with the Middle East has developed rapidly. In 1952, West Germany's exports to the Middle East exceeded the level of Germany's exports to the region in 1936. From 1953 to 1955, West Germany's exports to the Middle East increased by about 50%, making its share in the region's trade second only to Britain and the United States, ranking third. This expansion rate has not been achieved by West German monopoly capital in any other region after the war.
    The forces of West German monopoly capital first penetrated into Turkey. Before the war, Turkey was in the sphere of influence of German monopoly capital, and Germany once accounted for nearly half of Turkey's import and export trade. After World War II, from 1952, West Germany once again jumped to the first place in Turkey's import trade, accounting for 25% of Turkey's total imports; by 1955, after the increase in US "aid" to Turkey, this first place was taken by US monopoly capital, and West Germany's imports decreased to only 17.6% of the total. But at present, Turkey is still West German monopoly capital's most important sales market and the most important supplier of raw materials in the Middle East. At the same time, the investment activities of West German monopoly enterprises in Turkey are also more active than in other countries in the Middle East.
    After the war, West German monopoly capital used the anti-British sentiment of the Egyptian people to seize part of the British goods market. From 1949 to 1953, West German exports to Egypt increased twenty-five times. In 1952, West Germany ranked sixth in Egypt's import trade, and in 1953 it jumped to second place, surpassing Britain and second only to the United States. After fierce competition, Britain regained the top spot in 1955, overwhelming the United States and West Germany. In 1955, the shares of the three countries in Egypt's imports were: Britain 13% (1950: 21%); the United States 12% (reached 28% in 1951); West Germany 11%, equivalent to the level of 1938 (1950: 3%). These facts reflect the fierce competition between the monopoly capital of Britain, the United States, and West Germany.
    In Iran, West German monopoly capital also used the anti-British sentiment of the Iranian people to launch extensive activities. After the war, the position of British monopoly capital in Iran was greatly weakened due to the intrusion of the United States (Iran received 66% of US "aid" to the Middle East). After West German monopoly capital re-entered the Iranian market, the interests of British monopoly capital were attacked on two fronts; at the same time, the competition between West German and American monopoly capital became increasingly fierce. For example, West German exports of automobiles to Iran increased tenfold in the year from 1953 to 1954, greatly affecting the sales of American automobiles. There was a similar situation in the sales of chemical products. American monopoly capital was quite dissatisfied with this. In Iran's imports in 1955, the United States ranked first, accounting for 26.3%; Britain ranked second, accounting for 24%; West Germany ranked third, accounting for 23%. The three countries temporarily maintained a relatively balanced "tripartite" situation.
    In Syria and Lebanon, the competition between West German and French monopoly capital is also very fierce. In Saudi Arabia and Iraq (West Germany's main suppliers of crude oil), due to the strong advantages of US and British monopoly capital, West German goods are more difficult to enter the markets of these two countries, so West Germany's trade with these two countries has always been in an unfavorable position of trade deficit. But West Germany has still seized certain positions in these two countries. For example, West German monopoly capital was able to defeat other imperialist competitors and contract a number of projects in Iraq with a total value of no less than 300 million marks.
    It is obvious that the expansion of West German monopoly capital in various countries in the Middle East has not only steadily hit the traditional markets of British and French monopoly capital, but has also begun to threaten the power of American goods in the region. More importantly, West German monopoly capital has begun to break into the areas that have always been controlled by US and British monopoly capital—the Middle East oil industry. Since the autumn of 1954, West German oil monopoly groups have successively obtained oil exploration and exploitation rights in a series of countries along the Mediterranean coast, such as Yemen, Turkey, Greece, and Egypt. This fact has caused unease among US and British monopoly capital. But West German monopoly capital is not satisfied with this. West Germany's "Industrie-Kurier" even openly put forward the slogan of "internationalizing Middle East oil" on March 29 this year. This is actually a demand to allow West German monopoly capital to participate in the plunder of oil resources in the Middle East on a larger scale. In the eyes of West German monopoly capital, the raw materials and markets in the Middle East are obviously very important for their economic expansion. The production capacity of the West German oil refining industry is very large, but the country can only supply one-third of the crude oil it needs, and the rest is entirely dependent on imports. And about 87.5% of the imported crude oil comes from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait and other places in the Middle East. Other important raw materials imported by West Germany from the Middle East also account for a large proportion of the total amount of each of these raw materials imported by West Germany. For example: chromite sand (accounting for 60% of West Germany's total chromite sand imports), jute (accounting for 45%), copper sand (36.8%), tobacco leaves (30.6%), sulfur stone (29.2%), raw cotton (21.7%). In addition, edible oil, grains, fruits, etc. also account for a certain amount in West Germany's imports. In West Germany's exports to the Middle East, machinery, electrical equipment, and transportation vehicles account for 45.1%, other manufactured products (mainly steel products, optical and scientific instruments, and textiles) account for 39.6%, and chemical products (fertilizers, power fuels, and medicines) account for 11.8%. At present, West Germany's import and export trade with the Middle East accounts for about a quarter of its overseas trade (excluding trade with Western Europe). Not only that, West Germany's trade in the Middle East has always had a large trade surplus. In 1955, the total value of West Germany's exports to the Middle East countries was nearly 1.6 billion marks, and the total value of imports from the Middle East region was 1.264 billion marks. But it should be pointed out that crude oil accounts for 32.8% of West Germany's imports from the Middle East, but crude oil does not belong to the exporting countries but to the US and British oil monopoly enterprises. If crude oil is removed, then the total value of West Germany's imports from the Middle East region in 1955 was only 600 million marks. This large trade surplus has been used by West German monopoly capital as a means of exerting political and economic pressure in order to penetrate its influence more deeply into these countries.
    It can be seen that West German monopoly capital now wants to take advantage of the crisis of Britain and France to further expand into the Middle East, which will undoubtedly make the struggle of imperialist countries for raw materials and markets more acute.

    西德垄断资本在中近东卷土重来
    王禺
    在埃及把苏伊士运河公司收归国有和英、法发动侵略埃及的战争以后，西德政府的态度在表面上似乎装得不想积极干与的样子，但是在骨子里却是存着一种“隔山观虎斗”的打算。许多资产阶级报刊纷纷透露，西德垄断资本对于英、法在中近东地区所遭遇到的巨大困难和失败显然感到非常高兴。他们认为，英、法的困难处境是他们进一步插入中近东地区的一个大好机会。不久前，鲁尔区大资产阶级喉舌“工业快邮报”就写道：
  “在目前的情况下，中近东各国较以往更甚地期待着其他欧洲出口国——特别是德意志联邦共和国——能体谅其经济上的困难。……目前正是西德在中近东进行活动的最有利的时机！”
    西德垄断资本这种态度的背后明显的隐藏着它们渴望在中近东卷土重来的野心，同时也反映了西德垄断资本和英、法以及美国的垄断资本之间在中近东地区的深刻的矛盾。
    在第二次大战之后，在中近东有过不小影响的德国帝国主义的势力曾经是暂时被逐出了这个地区。但是，德国垄断资本从来没有放弃他们重新加入帝国主义争夺中近东地区的市场和原料的斗争的想望，并且在他们逐渐恢复了经济上的实力以后，就积极投入了这一斗争。这样就在争夺中近东地区原料和市场的已经十分紧张的英美矛盾之外，又增添了英德和美德之间的尖锐矛盾，使帝国主义间在这一地区的明争暗斗的关系变得更加错综复杂起来。
    西德垄断资本在重新加入中近东地区的贸易战争时，一方面仗着它在技术和成本等方面的某些有利条件，一方面也巧妙地利用战后中近东各国人民反对英、法殖民主义统治的情绪，乘机扩大西德商品的销路。近几年来，依靠了这种经济和政治的双管齐下的办法，西德对中近东地区的贸易已经有了迅速的发展。在1952年时，西德对中近东的出口已超过全德1936年对这一地区的出口水平。从1953到1955年的三年中，西德对中近东出口又增加了50％左右，使它在这个地区的贸易中所占的份额仅次于英美两国，而居于第三位。这一扩张速度是西德垄断资本战后在任何其他地区所不曾达到的。
    西德垄断资本势力首先向土耳其渗入。战前土耳其是德国垄断资本的势力范围，当时德国曾一度在土耳其进出口贸易中占到将近一半的份额。在第二次大战之后，从1952年起西德又在土耳其进口贸易中跃居首位，占土耳其进口总额的25％；到1955年，土耳其的美“援”增加之后，这一首位就被美国垄断资本夺去了，西德的进口减少到只占总额的17.6％。但是目前土耳其依然是西德垄断资本在中近东的最主要销售市场和最重要的原料供应者。同时西德垄断企业在土耳其的投资活动也比在中近东其他国家都更加活跃。
    战后西德垄断资本利用埃及人民的反英情绪夺得了一部分英国货的市场。从1949年到1953年，西德对埃及出口增加了二十五倍。1952年西德在埃及进口贸易中尚居第六位，1953年即一跃而至第二位，超过英国，仅次于美国。在经过剧烈竞争之后，英国在1955年又争回了首位，压倒了美国和西德。1955年三国在埃及进口中所占份额是：英国13％（1950：21％）；美国12％（1951年曾达到28％）；西德11％，相当于1938年的水平（1950：3％）。从这些事实里反映出英、美、西德三国垄断资本间竞争的剧烈。
    在伊朗，西德垄断资本也利用了伊朗人民的反英情绪而展开了广泛的活动。战后英国垄断资本在伊朗的地位曾经由于美国的侵入而大为削弱（伊朗分得美国对中近东“援助”的66％），在西德垄断资本重新进入伊朗市场之后，英国垄断资本的利益就受到两方面的进攻；同时西德和美国垄断资本间的竞争也日趋剧烈。例如西德对伊朗的汽车出口在1953到1954的一年内增加了十倍，使美国汽车的销路大受影响。在化学品的销售方面也有类似情况。美国垄断资本对此颇为不满。在1955年的伊朗进口中，美国居第一位，占26.3％；英国居第二位，占24％；西德居第三位，占23％。三国暂时保持着“鼎足三分”的相对均势。
    在叙利亚和黎巴嫩两国，西德和法国垄断资本之间的竞争也是十分剧烈的。而在沙特阿拉伯和伊拉克（西德原油的主要供应者），由于美、英垄断资本有着强大的优势，西德商品较难进入这两国的市场，因此西德对这两国的贸易一贯处在入超的不利地位。但西德在这两个国家仍然夺取了某些阵地。例如：西德垄断资本竟能击败其他帝国主义竞争对手而在伊拉克承包了总值不下三亿马克的多项工程。
    很明显，西德垄断资本在中近东各国的扩张不仅节节打入了英法垄断资本的传统市场，而且也已开始威胁到美国商品在这一地区的势力。而更重要的是，西德垄断资本已开始闯入一向为美、英垄断资本所把持的禁区——中东石油业。自1954年秋季以来，西德石油业垄断集团先后在地中海沿岸的也门、土耳其、希腊、埃及等一系列国家取得了钻探和开采石油的特许权。这一事实已引起美、英垄断资本的不安。但是西德垄断资本对此还并不满足。西德“工业快邮报”在今年3月29日更公开提出了“中东石油国际化”的口号。这实际上是要求让西德垄断资本能更大规模地参与对中近东石油富源的掠夺。在西德垄断资本看来，中近东的原料和市场对他们的经济扩张显然是十分重要的。西德石油精炼工业的生产能力很大，但所需原油本国只能自给三分之一，其余完全依靠进口。而进口原油的87.5％左右是来自中近东的沙特阿拉伯、伊拉克、伊朗、科威特等地。西德自中近东进口的其他重要原料在其所进口的各该项原料的总量中也占有颇大的比重。例如：铬砂（占西德全部铬砂进口的60％）、黄麻（占45％）、铜砂（36.8％）、烟叶（30.6％）、硫磺石（29.2％）、原棉（21.7％）。另外食油、谷类、水果等也在西德进口中占有一定的数量。在西德对中近东的出口中，机器、电器设备和运输工具占45.1％，其他制成品（主要是钢铁制品、光学及科学仪器和纺织品）占39.6％，化学品（肥料、动力燃料、药品）占11.8％。西德对中近东地区的进出口贸易在目前已约占它的海外贸易（即除去对西欧贸易）的四分之一左右。不仅如此，西德在中近东的贸易，还一直有着大贸易顺差。在1955年西德对中近东各国的出口总值将近十六亿马克，自中近东地区的进口总值十二亿六千四百万马克。但是应当指出：在西德从中近东的进口货中原油占32.8％，而原油却并不属于各出口国而是属于美英石油垄断企业的。如果除去原油这一部分，那么1955年西德从中近东地区的进口总值只有六亿马克。这笔大量的贸易盈余已被西德垄断资本用来作为政治上和经济上施加压力的手段，以便自己的势力更深入到这些国家里去。
    可以看出，西德垄断资本现在想乘英、法之危进一步向中近东实行扩张，这无疑会使帝国主义国家争夺原料和市场的斗争更加尖锐起来。
