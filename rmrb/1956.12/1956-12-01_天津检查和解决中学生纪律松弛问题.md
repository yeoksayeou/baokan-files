Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　Tianjin's education departments and the Communist Youth League organizations have inspected the problem of lax discipline among secondary school students and have begun to address it.

　　In some middle schools in Tianjin, the phenomenon of students talking, laughing, fighting, and playing with small animals in class is very common in junior high school classes. In the first grade of junior high school at No. 11 Middle School, some students sometimes read comic books for four consecutive class periods. Other junior high school students ask teachers strange questions in class, the classroom discipline is also very poor, and after class they do not study well on their own, wasting their time playing.

　　The reasons for poor discipline among junior high school students are very complex. This year's enrollment figures are very large, and more than 1,600 classes have implemented a two-part system, and many schools' work has not kept up. Some schools have classes that have not had teachers to teach them for a long time after the start of the semester. Some new teachers also lack teaching experience. Veteran teachers with many years of teaching experience reflect that there are also shortcomings in ideological education in middle schools; it has not been possible to conduct enlightening and guiding education based on the specific circumstances of junior high school students being younger and more playful, and they rely solely on reprimands and transferring classes.

　　In senior high schools and secondary technical schools, some teachers have adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards students, fearing that they would hinder the development of students' personalities, and they are constrained in their work, not even daring to make classroom rules or organize collective activities. Some students have a very vague understanding of freedom and discipline. Students at the Tianjin Petroleum Industry School and the Paper Industry School do not even attend morning exercises and morning self-study because they emphasize freedom. Some students demand five classes in the morning and complete freedom to dispose of their time in the afternoon; when the school disagrees, they consider it undemocratic.

　　In response to these situations, the Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau has decided that in the future, it will strengthen positive ideological education for students in secondary schools, and change the past view that ideological education is only the responsibility of the class teacher and the guidance group. When conducting ideological education, teachers are required to have close cooperation between teachers, and between schools and parents. At the same time, they are starting to solve the problem of lack of guidance for students' extracurricular activities due to the implementation of the two-part system. After some schools, such as No. 18 Middle School and No. 29 Middle School, have paid attention to guiding students' extracurricular activities, the problem of student discipline has improved. The Communist Youth League organization is also preparing to exchange experiences in guiding students' extracurricular activities and further strengthen ideological education among the league and team cadres in various schools.

### 天津检查和解决中学生纪律松弛问题

　　天津检查和解决中学生纪律松弛问题
    新华社讯　天津市教育部门和青年团组织对中等学校学生纪律松弛的问题进行了检查并着手解决这个问题。
    天津市有些中学校初中班级的学生，上课时说笑打闹和玩各种小动物的现象很普遍。第十一中学初中一年级有的学生有时在课堂上连着看四节课的连环画。其他有些初中学生在课堂上向教师提怪问题，课堂纪律也很差，课后又不好好自学，把时间都浪费在玩闹上了。
    初中学生纪律不好的原因是很复杂的。今年招生数字很大，而且有一千六百多个班实行了二部制，很多学校的工作跟不上来。有的学校有些课在开学以后很久还没有教师来上。一些新教师也缺乏教学的经验。有多年教学经验的老教师反映，在中学的思想教育上也存在着缺点，没能够根据初中学生年龄较小、贪玩等具体情况进行启发和诱导教育，单纯靠斥责、调班的办法。
    在高中和中等技术学校里，有一些教师对学生采取了放任自流的态度，怕妨碍学生个性的发展，工作中束手束脚，连教室规则也不敢订，集体活动也不敢组织，有的学生对自由与纪律的认识很模糊。天津市石油工业学校、造纸工业学校的学生因为强调自由，就连早操和早自习也不上了。有些学生要求上午上五节课，下午完全自由支配时间，学校不同意时，就认为是不民主。
    针对这些情况，天津市教育局决定今后在中等学校中要加强对学生的正面的思想教育工作，改变过去认为思想教育只是班主任和辅导组的事的看法；在进行思想教育时，要求教师与教师之间、学校与家长之间有紧密的配合；同时着手解决因实行二部制而产生的缺乏对学生课外活动的辅导的问题。在第十八中学、二十九中学等一些学校重视了对学生课外活动的辅导以后，学生纪律问题已经有了好转。青年团组织也准备在各学校的团、队干部中交流辅导学生课外活动的经验和进一步加强思想教育工作。
