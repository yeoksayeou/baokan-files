Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 9th: TASS reported that Austrian newspapers are publishing daily reports about the tragic situation of Hungarian citizens in Austrian refugee camps and their willingness to return home.

    "Austrian People's Voice" said that not only individuals, but entire groups of Hungarian citizens are returning from Austria to Hungary. Some of them returned home with the assistance of the Hungarian Minister, while others secretly crossed the border to return home.
    The Austrian authorities are doing everything possible to prevent Hungarians from returning to their homeland. Until now, the Austrian authorities have not agreed to allow representatives of the Hungarian government to visit the camps that house Hungarian refugees.
    At the same time, the Austrian authorities are directly handing over many Hungarian refugee camps to Western European and American "charitable" organizations and Red Cross organizations, allowing these organizations to send Hungarian citizens to various countries far away from Hungary.

    匈难民要求回国
    遭奥当局百般阻挠
    据新华社10日讯　塔斯社维也纳9日讯：奥地利报纸每天都登载了关于匈牙利公民在奥地利难民营里处境悲惨和他们愿意回国的消息。
    “奥地利人民之声报”说，从奥地利回到匈牙利不仅是个别的人，而是成批的匈牙利公民。他们有些得到匈牙利公使的协助回了家，有些就偷偷地越过国境回国去。
    奥地利当局正在百般阻挠匈牙利人返回祖国。直到现在，奥地利当局还没有答应让匈牙利政府的代表访问收容匈牙利难民的集中营。
    同时，奥地利当局还把许多匈牙利难民营直接交给西欧和美国的“慈善”组织和红十字会组织管理，让这些组织把匈牙利公民送到远离匈牙利的各个国家里去。
