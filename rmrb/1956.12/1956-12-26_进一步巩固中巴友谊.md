　　Our Premier Zhou Enlai, at the invitation of Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy and the Pakistani government, went to Pakistan on the 20th of this month for a friendly visit. Premier Zhou Enlai's visit was warmly received and grandly welcomed by Pakistani government leaders, Pakistani political parties and organizations, and people from all walks of life, which fully demonstrated the deep friendship of the Pakistani people towards the Chinese people. During the visit, Premier Zhou Enlai discussed matters of mutual concern and the recent developments in the international situation with the Pakistani Prime Minister. In the joint statement signed on the 24th of this month, they reaffirmed the common desire of China and Pakistan to strengthen friendly relations and promote world peace and understanding. This is of great significance not only for further consolidating the friendship between China and Pakistan, but also for creating a peaceful atmosphere in the current international situation.
　　Both China and Pakistan are new countries that have broken away from colonial rule and gained independence in the historical period after World War II. Our common need is peace, to work hard to build our own countries, to improve our production levels, and to change the backwardness of our countries. Although our two countries have different political and social systems, and we have our own views on many issues, this does not hinder the strengthening of friendship between our two countries, because there are no real conflicts of interest between us. China and Pakistan are also participants in the Asian-African Conference, and the spirit and principles of peace, independence and international cooperation expressed at this conference can serve as a solid common foundation for friendly coexistence between our two countries.
　　In recent years, economic and cultural exchanges between China and Pakistan have been developing continuously. The volume of trade between our two countries is gradually increasing, and the amount of Pakistani cotton purchased by China accounts for a large proportion of Pakistan's total cotton exports. Regarding China's exports to Pakistan, in addition to rice, a trade agreement has been signed this year to supply coal to Pakistan. Similarly, friendly contacts between the governments and peoples of the two countries are also increasing day by day. In this year alone, Song Qingling, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of our country, and Vice Premier of the State Council He Long have been invited to visit Pakistan. This was followed by Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to China in October this year and Premier Zhou Enlai's reciprocal friendly visit to Pakistan. In addition, people-to-people contacts between the two countries have also expanded. We have not only seen exchanges between trade union representatives and women's representatives, but also between religious circles, scientific circles, medical workers, journalists and football players. We are pleased to see that the joint statement between the Prime Ministers of China and Pakistan expresses the common desire of both sides: In order to strengthen the existing harmonious and friendly relations between the two countries, appropriate attention will be paid to the commercial and cultural relations between the two countries. We believe that the friendly cooperation between China and Pakistan in this regard has broad prospects.
　　Many of our Asian and African countries have suffered from colonialism in the past, and now we are facing the same or similar problems. Therefore, it is entirely in the common interest of the people of Asian and African countries to enhance understanding and learn from each other through cultural and economic exchanges and friendly exchanges. Of course, due to the evil consequences of long-term colonial rule, certain unresolved issues have also been left behind in the relations between Asian and African countries. Colonialists are attempting to use these issues to provoke, divide and weaken the unity of Asian and African countries in order to achieve their goal of restoring colonial rule. However, as long as Asian and African countries take into account our common situation and common interests, and as long as they conduct consultations on the basis of mutual trust and understanding, and on the basis of peace and justice, any unresolved issues between Asian and African countries will be resolved satisfactorily, and their friendly cooperation will be continuously developed and strengthened.
　　Due to the armed aggression launched by the colonialists against Egypt, and due to the continued pursuit of the Cold War policy by certain forces in the international arena, the current international situation is showing a tense atmosphere again. To this end, the two Prime Ministers reiterated the common desire to "make every effort to ease international tensions and promote the cause of world peace and understanding." It is quite clear that this is also in line with the common aspirations of the people of Asian and African countries and the people of the world.
　　The Chinese people are willing to work together with the Pakistani people, together with the people of Asian and African countries, to continuously strengthen and consolidate the unity and cooperation of the people of Asian and African countries, and to work hard to ease international tensions and promote the cause of world peace and understanding.

### 进一步巩固中巴友谊

    进一步巩固中巴友谊
    我国周恩来总理应巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底和巴基斯坦政府的邀请，于本月20日赴巴基斯坦，进行友好访问。周恩来总理的访问，受到了巴基斯坦政府领导人、巴基斯坦各政党团体和各界人民的殷切招待和盛大欢迎，这充分表现了巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。在访问期间，周恩来总理同巴基斯坦总理讨论了双方互相关心的事项和国际局势最近的发展。他们在本月24日签署的联合声明中，重申了中巴两国加强友好关系和促进世界和平和谅解的共同愿望。这不仅对于进一步巩固中巴两国的友谊，而且对于在目前国际局势中创造和平的气氛，都有重要的意义。
    中巴两国都是在第二次世界大战以后的历史时期中摆脱了殖民主义的统治而获得独立的新国家。我们共同的需要是和平，是努力建设自己的国家，是提高我们的生产水平，是改变我们国家的落后面貌。我们两国的政治和社会制度虽然不同，我们两国对许多问题虽然有各自的看法，但是这并不能妨害我们两国之间友谊的加强，因为在我们两国之间没有任何真正的利益冲突。中巴两国同时又都是亚非会议的参加者，这个会议所表达的和平、独立和国际合作的精神和原则，可以成为我们两国友好相处的巩固的共同基础。
    近几年来，中巴两国间的经济、文化交流正在不断发展。我们两国的贸易额在逐步增长，我国购买巴基斯坦棉花的数量在巴基斯坦棉花出口总量中占着很大的比重。在我国对巴基斯坦出口方面，除大米以外，今年又签订了对巴基斯坦供应煤炭的贸易协定。同样，两国政府和人民的友好接触也正日益增多。仅仅今年一年，就有我全国人民代表大会常务委员会宋庆龄副委员长、国务院贺龙副总理先后应邀去巴基斯坦访问。接着又有苏拉瓦底总理今年10月来我国和周恩来总理此次去巴基斯坦的互相友好访问。此外，两国人民之间的接触也扩大了，我们不仅看到工会代表、妇女代表间的来往，也看到宗教界、科学界、医务工作者、新闻工作者和足球队员之间的彼此交往。我们高兴地看到，中巴两国总理联合声明表示了双方的共同意愿：为了加强两国现存的融洽和友好关系，将对两国的商务和文化关系给以恰当的重视。我们相信中巴两国在这方面的友好合作是有广大前途的。
    我们许多亚非国家过去同受殖民主义之害，现在都面临着相同的或相类似的问题。因此，亚非各国人民通过文化经济交流和友好往来，增进了解，并互相学习，这是完全符合亚非各国人民的共同利益的。当然，由于殖民主义长期统治的恶果，在亚非国家的关系中也遗留下来某些悬而未决的问题，殖民主义者正企图利用这些问题来挑拨、分裂和削弱亚非国家的团结，以达到它们恢复殖民统治的目的。但是，亚非各国只要考虑到我们的共同处境和共同利益，只要根据互相信任和谅解的精神，在和平正义的基础上进行协商，那么亚非各国之间的任何悬而未决的问题都会求得圆满的解决，它们之间的友好合作就会得到不断的发展和加强。
    由于殖民主义者对埃及发动了武装侵略，由于国际间某些势力继续推行冷战政策，目前的国际局势又呈现出紧张的气氛。两国总理为此重申了“应尽一切努力来和缓国际紧张局势和促进世界和平和谅解的事业”的共同愿望。十分明显，这也是符合于亚非各国人民和全世界人民的共同愿望的。
    中国人民愿意同巴基斯坦人民一起，同亚非各国人民一起，为不断地加强和巩固亚非各国人民的团结合作而努力，为缓和国际紧张局势和促进世界和平和谅解的事业而努力。
