Better Develop the People's Savings Business
Commentator of this Newspaper

Developing the people's savings business is an important method of accumulating funds for socialist construction, and it plays an important role in supporting China's current economic construction. Its role and significance go far beyond this. By developing the savings business, it is also possible to cultivate people's good habits of hard work, thrift, and reasonable arrangement of economic life. This is precisely the kind of good atmosphere that is particularly needed during the period of socialist construction.

In recent years, due to the rapid development of the country's economic construction and the increasing stability of currency value and prices, the amount of savings of the broad masses of urban and rural people in banks has increased year by year. By the end of 1955, the total urban savings balance reached more than 1.56 billion yuan, equivalent to more than twice that of 1952. This year, due to the wage reform, as of mid-November, the total urban savings balance had reached more than 2.17 billion yuan. According to statistics from the People's Bank of China in 27 provinces and cities, the number of new savings accounts opened in banks in the third quarter of this year (after the wage increase) increased by more than 1.8 million compared with the second quarter.

Judging from the situation of the People's Bank of China absorbing people's deposits in various places, this year's tasks have generally been completed relatively well. However, the potential for mass savings is still great. The broad masses of workers and staff have a high degree of enthusiasm for saving after their wages have increased; the wage reform work of joint state-private enterprises and a small number of state-owned enterprises has not yet been finalized; in addition, the fixed interest received by capitalists and the principal and interest of matured government bonds are all available for savings.

At present, 15,000 agency savings offices have been established in provinces and cities across the country (the business of these agency offices is handled concurrently by the financial accounting staff of various agencies, enterprises, organizations, schools, etc., and the bank pays a certain subsidy, without assigning additional business personnel there). Together with the original institutions of the People's Bank of China, they constitute a vast savings network, with an average of one savings institution for every 4,000 urban residents. Experience has proved that these savings agency offices not only make it convenient for workers and staff to deposit and withdraw funds (they can deposit funds without leaving the agency, or withdraw them for use at any time), but also benefit the work of the agency. The current issue is that each agency should give support and help to the business of the agency offices so that they can give full play to their role. The People's Bank of China should also pay attention to establishing savings institutions in areas with inconvenient transportation or departments with high work mobility (such as geological exploration departments) to meet the savings requirements of workers and staff in these areas and departments.

To widely carry out savings business, it is also necessary to patiently and meticulously publicize policies so that the masses can truly understand that saving is beneficial to both the country and themselves, let them understand the methods, business items and procedures for saving, and ensure that the masses are voluntary in depositing and withdrawing. Recently, with the development of business, some staff members of bank savings institutions have not clearly grasped the policy boundaries of the principle of voluntariness, so some disguised coercion and even coercion have reappeared. For example, when mobilizing the masses to save, they actually adopted the method of forced persuasion, and some areas even put forward wrong slogans such as "every household saves, everyone saves" and "eliminate blank accounts." Some banking institutions in Jiangxi Province assigned savings "tasks" according to units, industries, and resident organizations, which resulted in the phenomena of average apportionment, monthly deductions, and door-to-door collection. Similar simple and crude methods will naturally arouse dissatisfaction among the masses. Judging from the deposit balance, such savings are also unstable – many people often quickly withdraw the money after being forced to deposit it. Savings business personnel should all remember such experiences and lessons, and always be vigilant against the recurrence of such shortcomings in their work. Only in this way can the people's savings business develop more healthily and solidly.

    更好地发展人民储蓄事业
    本报评论员
    发展人民储蓄事业，是积累社会主义建设资金的重要方法之一，它对支持当前我国的经济建设起着重要作用。它的作用和意义还远不止于此。通过发展储蓄事业，还能够培养人们艰苦朴素、合理地安排经济生活的良好习惯。这正是在社会主义建设时期特别需要的一种好风气。
    几年来，由于国家经济建设事业迅速发展，币值和物价日趋稳定，广大城乡人民在银行储蓄的款额逐年增加。到1955年底，全国城市储蓄总余额达到十五亿六千多万元，相当于1952年的二倍多。今年由于进行了工资改革，到11月中旬为止，城市储蓄总余额已经达到二十一亿七千多万元。根据人民银行二十七个省市的统计，今年第三季度（增加工资以后）在银行新开户的储户比第二季度增加了一百八十多万户。
    从各地人民银行吸收人民存款的情况来看，今年的任务一般完成得比较好。但群众储蓄潜力仍然很大。广大职工工资增加后要求储蓄的积极性很高；公私合营企业和一小部分国营企业的工资改革工作尚未最后完成；此外，资方人员拿到的定息以及到期的公债还本付息等都还是可以储蓄的。
    目前全国各省市已经设立了一万五千个机关储蓄代办所（这种代办所的业务是由各机关、企业、团体、学校等单位的财务会计人员兼办的，银行付给一定的津贴，不在那里另派业务人员），连同人民银行原有机构，构成了广大的储蓄网，平均每四千个城市人口中就有一个储蓄机构。经验证明，这种储蓄代办所不但便利职工存取款项（不出机关大门就可以把款存上，或者随时取出来使用），而且对机关工作也有好处。当前的问题是要各机关对代办所的业务给以支持和帮助，使它们充分发挥作用。人民银行还应该注意在交通不便的地区或工作流动性较大的部门（如地质勘探部门）设立储蓄机构，以满足这些地区和部门的职工的储蓄要求。
    要广泛开展储蓄业务，还必须耐心细致地宣传政策，让群众切实明了储蓄对国家对自己都是有利的事情，让他们了解储蓄的方法、业务项目和办理手续，并且保证群众存取自愿。近来，随着业务的发展，有一些银行储蓄机构的工作人员还没有明确掌握自愿原则的政策界限，以致又出现了一些变相强迫命令甚至是强迫命令的作法。例如在动员群众储蓄的时候竟采用强拉苦劝的作法，个别地区甚至提出“家家储蓄、人人储蓄”“消灭空白户”等错误口号。江西省有的银行机构按单位、行业、居民组织分配储蓄“任务”，以致发生了平均摊派、按月扣款、上门催讨的现象。类似的简单粗暴的作法，自然会引起群众不满。从存款余额上看，这样的储蓄也是不巩固的——许多人往往在被迫存了之后又很快地把钱取光。储蓄业务人员都应该记取这样的经验教训，随时警惕在工作中不再发生这类缺点。只有这样，人民储蓄事业才能更健康更巩固地发展。
