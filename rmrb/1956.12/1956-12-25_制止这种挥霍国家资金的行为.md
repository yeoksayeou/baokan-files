    Stop This Waste of State Funds
    Editor:
    On November 28th, three of our comrades went to the Central Schistosomiasis Prevention Office in Shanghai to discuss work. We overheard several responsible comrades of this unit discussing how to rush spending the money without any scruples. It turned out that the unit of the Central Ministry of Health in Nanjing had an unused budget of 330,000 yuan for purchasing houses in 1956. Now there is a house for sale in Nanjing, but this unit is going to move to Shanghai, so there is no need to buy a house there anymore. If the money is taken to Shanghai, according to the budget system, there is only one month to spend it. How can it be used up? At this critical moment, the responsible comrade who came from Nanjing came up with a brilliant idea: he believed that if this large sum of money could not be spent, it would have to be turned over. Therefore, it would be better to buy the house in Nanjing first, use the 330,000 yuan budget, and avoid freezing and turning it over. Next year, when the office moves to Shanghai, the house in Nanjing can be sold again, and the money can be used to buy a house in Shanghai. Several responsible comrades agreed with this comrade's thoughtful plan with joy, and the 330,000 yuan budget was thus "arranged."
    We do not know whether the current housing of the Central Ministry of Health's work unit in Shanghai is sufficient or not; we also do not know whether it is necessary to spend 330,000 yuan to buy a house. But hearing these comrades' spending plan is inevitably surprising. Do these responsible comrades not understand that they should strictly implement the state's financial and economic system? Recently, the Party newspaper has repeatedly exposed and criticized the mistake of rushing to spend money at the end of the year. Have they not seen it? I hope the responsible comrades of this unit can answer this.

    As the end of the year approaches, the Luoyang Municipal People's Committee is rushing to spend money again. In November, they had already "arranged" for more than 800,000 yuan of surplus funds from capital construction projects; however, due to the urban construction department's loose budgeting, another 700,000 yuan was saved. In order to implement the leaders' intentions, the Urban Construction Committee convened a meeting of relevant personnel on December 7 to discuss the expenditure of this money: on the one hand, "ambushes" were set up, allocating 180,000 yuan to the Municipal Engineering Office; in addition, the money was used for some unnecessary places, such as taking out 100,000 yuan to purchase equipment for the Friendship Hotel. Three years ago, the provincial government transferred a Zhongji Jeep to the Municipal People's Committee. Because it was not used, it was sold for 22,000 yuan. This money should have been turned over in full, but Secretary-General Liu instructed the Administrative Section to buy a sedan car, saying: "No matter whether it is good or bad, buy one first. If it is not good, sell it next year and buy another one. Otherwise, if the money is turned over at the end of the year, it will not be possible to buy it!" Under the influence of the Municipal People's Committee, various departments are also actively looking for ways to spend money. The Municipal Epidemic Prevention Station purchased two bicycles and a radio without authorization, without prior approval, using the surplus of more than 1,600 yuan. This phenomenon is fundamentally contrary to the call for increasing production and practicing economy in the Second Plenary Session. We suggest that the higher-level authorities should immediately stop this unhealthy trend.

### 制止这种挥霍国家资金的行为

    制止这种挥霍国家资金的行为编辑同志：
    11月28日，我们三位同志到驻在上海的中央血吸虫防治办公室谈工作，听到这个单位几位负责同志正在毫无顾虑地商讨如何突击花钱。原来中央卫生部在南京的单位，1956年度购买房屋的三十三万元预算还没有用。现在南京正有一幢房屋出卖，可是这个单位将要迁到上海来，没有再买房屋的必要。如把钱拿到上海来用，按预算制度的规定，期限只有一个月，怎能用完呢？在这个紧要关头，从南京赶来的那位负责同志想出一条妙计：认为这一大笔钱若是花不了，就得上缴。因此不如先把南京那幢可买的房屋买下来，把三十三万元预算用了，免致冻结上缴。明年机关搬到上海来，再把南京那幢房屋出卖掉，拿钱到上海买房屋。几位负责同志，都面带喜色地同意这位同志周到的计划，三十三万元预算，就这样得到了“安排”。
    中央卫生部在上海的工作单位，现在的房屋够用不够用，我们不知道；需要不需要三十三万元买房屋，我们也是不知道，但听了这些同志的花钱计划不免令人惊讶。难道这些负责同志不懂得应该严格执行国家的财经制度吗？最近，党报上不只一次地揭发和批判年终突击花钱的错误，难道他们没有见到吗？希望这个单位的负责同志解答一下。

    随着年终将至，洛阳市人民委员会又在突击花钱了。在11月，它们曾对基本建设工程结余的八十多万元作了“安排”；但是，由于城市建设部门的宽打窄用，又节余七十多万元，为了贯彻领导意图，城市建设委员会在12月7日召集有关人员会议，讨论了这笔钱的开支：一方面打“埋伏”，拨给市政工程处十八万元；此外，把钱用于一些不必要地方。如拿出十万元给友谊宾馆添购设备。三年前，省政府调给市人民委员会中吉普车一辆，因不用，卖了二万二千元，这笔钱本应全部上缴，但刘秘书长却指示行政科要买卧车，并说：“不管好坏，先买一部，不好，明年卖了再买，不然，到年底把款上缴了，就买不成啦！”各部门在市人民委员会的影响下，也在积极的找花钱的窍门。市防疫站把结余的一千六百多元，先斩后奏的擅自添购了自行车二辆，收音机一部。这种现象是与二中全会增产节约的号召根本违背的。我们建议上级机关应该立即制止这种歪风。
