　　Bad Customs
　　Cao Yu
    There is an old saying: "Old habits die hard." This refers to the fact that bad customs and habits passed down over many years are often not easy to change. In the new society, this sentence is no longer very applicable. Let's not mention earth-shattering events like the socialist transformation of industry and commerce, just the fact that more than four thousand cases of picking up money and not pocketing it have appeared in Shanghai in the past year, as reported in the newspapers a few days ago, shows that even the long-standing habits of greed and petty profiteering are changing under the socialist sunshine. The change of long-standing habits is a new phenomenon in the new society, and such things are everywhere today.
    However, it would not be entirely correct to say that the phrase "old habits die hard" is completely inapplicable today. In some places, there are still some remaining bad customs and habits, which are glaringly out of place among the new things.
    What I am thinking of at the moment is the issue of many theater troupes today refusing to give playwrights performance royalties.
    Before liberation, generally speaking, theater troupes with a decent style would always give the playwright a performance royalty when they performed a play. The person in charge of the theater troupe took pride in this, and they felt that doing so was fulfilling a moral responsibility. The reason is simple: the person who writes the play has put in labor and should be paid for their labor. Furthermore, if the author is not given performance royalties, then the person who writes the play will starve, or will have to find another way to make a living. The result of both is equally detrimental to the theater troupe. If no one is willing to write plays, the work of the theater troupe will be affected. An old playwright once told me:
  “In the past, reactionary rulers used various methods to split the relationship between progressive theater troupes and authors, but we held each other tightly and supported each other. At that time, the life of the theater troupes was also very difficult, but the people in the theater troupes never forgot the friends who wrote plays for them, and they gave us performance royalties on time so that we could continue writing plays without any worries."
    However, at that time there was also a type of theater troupe manager who took pride in not giving performance royalties when they performed the author's plays. They often boasted that when some authors had no choice but to come to their door to request performance royalties, they could use many clever excuses, such as saying that life was hard, they were losing money, or they were short on funds, to avoid this small performance expense. Such people styled themselves as "savvy" "calculators." How many writers, throughout history and in China and abroad, have met them and felt as though they were being choked and had no way to deal with them. A director once met such a theater troupe "manager" and asked him why he didn't give a certain playwright performance royalties? He said triumphantly:
      "Someone will give it, don't worry."
      "Who?"
    "Other theater troupes will give it. This little money is nothing, but the money must be used for important things. Besides, hee, hee, hee, it's not good to feed these people too well."
    These words aroused our great indignation. But in this matter, the words of this theater troupe manager played a decisive role, and we could only be indignant. I remember that at that time, I received a clipping from the Shanghai Shen Bao, which contained advertisements for my four plays being performed in Shanghai at the same time, but on the day I received the letter, I was in a small tea shed in Chongqing, relying on a bowl of Tuo tea and a few baked wheaten cakes to get through the whole day. At that time, writers in that dark society were unwilling and unable to question, because it was useless anyway.
    Now, of course, everything is different. This kind of theater troupe "manager" is no longer in the drama circle, and the labor of literary and art workers is highly respected, but the phenomenon of not giving playwrights performance royalties still remains in many theaters and theater troupes. It is said that a play depicting agricultural production cooperatives has been performed more than a thousand times across the country, but the author has not received any income from the play's performances. Another play depicting the Long March was performed by a theater troupe in Northeast China, and the performance income was forty to fifty thousand yuan, but the author did not receive any labor remuneration from the theater troupe. Such things are too numerous to mention. I myself have written several plays, which are sometimes performed in some cities. Apart from some performances in Beijing and Shanghai, very few theater troupes have notified me. Some, when they remember to notify me, never mention performance royalties.
    An old playwright told me that he had once "shamelessly" asked someone to inquire about the performance royalties of his play from a theater troupe, because the theater troupe had performed his play many times in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and various large and small cities. But the answer he received was: ignored. The old playwright originally wanted to ask again, but he was afraid of being accused of "having bourgeois ideas and talking about money all the time," so he refused to ask any more questions.
    But precisely because these kinds of things of not paying royalties are happening all the time across the country, some authors have inevitably gone to the person in charge of the theater troupe to ask about it in person. But what he received was not the performance royalty, nor evasion, but a more resounding answer than any reason:
      "We have never given it!"
    Some people in charge of theater troupes are more polite; they ask someone to convey to the playwright very tactfully:
      "I'm sorry, we don't have this item in our budget."
    Another type of person in charge of a theater troupe is more generous. In order to avoid "nagging," he instructs the accountant:
    "Just give him a round number, two hundred yuan, forget it!"
    But there are also people who are more meticulous. When an actor asks him why he doesn't give the playwright performance royalties, he calmly says:
    "Wait for them to ask for it!"
    Later, the author did ask for it, but the reply he received said:
    "We want to give it, but we haven't seen the regulations on performance royalties, and we don't know how to give it. So, ... we are very sorry. ..."
    Can't you give it if you "haven't seen the regulations on performance royalties"? This is an excuse.
    Drama workers all know that paying playwrights performance royalties on time is a good practice in the drama industry, and some theaters and theater troupes have always done this today. As far as I know, there are the Central Academy of Drama, the China Youth Art Theater, the Beijing People's Art Theater, the Shanghai People's Art Theater, the Shanghai Film Actors Troupe, and the Beijing Experimental Drama Troupe (especially to point out that this is a private drama troupe). They do this because they believe that this is not a question of whether or not a regulation has been promulgated, but a question of moral responsibility. Because they themselves are artistic laborers, they also respect the artistic labor of others. The way they act not only makes playwrights grateful to them, but also encourages creation and helps the prosperity of creation.
    However, it should also be recognized that these theater and theater troupe leaders who refuse to give performance royalties are all revolutionary literary and art workers, and many of them are good comrades who have contributed to the revolution. They are diligent, conscientious, and hard-working, and have been engaged in various revolutionary work for many years. I can imagine that they relentlessly struggled against landlords in the land reform work, and righteously struggled against illegal capitalists in the Five-Anti Campaign. They put in selfless labor in the organization of drama work, and for the sake of work, they can stay up all night with red eyes and unable to eat. They absolutely cannot be compared with those theater troupe "managers" in the past mentioned earlier in this article, because one is a loyal revolutionary cadre, and the other is an art merchant who prides himself on being a calculating person. But, for playwrights, the effect of not being able to help them focus on their creations is the same.
    Today's theater and theater troupe leaders do not give playwrights performance royalties, perhaps due to negligence, or perhaps because they believe that the theater troupe is run by the state, and everything should be contributed to the public, and the playwright's personal remuneration should also be subordinate to the overall interests of the people. Of course, there may be other ideas as well. But in any case, they have forgotten one thing, that is: playwrights, like them, are laborers. Because they refuse to give playwrights performance royalties, playwrights suffer a lot of pain and trouble. A prominent example is that some accomplished and promising playwrights have given up playwriting, some have switched to writing novels, and some have gone to work as editors. But you can't blame them, because people's labor must have a certain amount of living materials to be able to maintain it.
    Indeed, there are still many people writing plays, but strictly speaking, they are all amateur playwrights, that is: they rely on salaries or income other than playwriting to live. We have professional novelists and professional poets, but the new China with a population of 600 million does not have a professional playwright. We have heard that there are forty or so state-owned drama troupes and theaters directly or indirectly led by the Ministry of Culture, and there are also many private drama troupes and other publicly ticketed drama performances. But these cannot cultivate a professional playwright who can rely on his performance royalties to maintain a reasonable life and write with peace of mind. This is a very strange thing.
    Break this bad custom and let professional playwrights emerge in China! This will be good for the prosperity of theatrical creation.

### 陋规

　　陋规
　　曹禺
    古人有一句话：“积习难改”，这指的是多年传下来的陋规和恶习往往是不容易变更的。在新社会里，这句话已经不很适用了。先不提工商业社会主义改造这一类轰轰烈烈的大事吧，仅说前两天报上登载着上海一年来出现四千多件拾金不昧的事情，就可见连贪财和占小便宜的积习也在社会主义的阳光下起了变化。积习的改变，是新社会的新气象，这类的事情在今天是到处都有的。
    然而如果说“积习难改”这句话在今天完全不适用了，这也不尽然。有些地方还存在着遗留下来的陋规和恶习，它夹在一片新的事物当中，就显得刺目。
    眼前我所想到的，是今天很多剧团拒绝给予剧作者上演报酬的问题。
    解放以前，一般作风正派的剧团演出一个剧本，总是给那写剧本的人上演的报酬的。剧团负责人以此为荣，他们觉得这样做仿佛尽了道义上的责任。道理也不多，大概是因为写戏的人付出了劳动，就该给他劳动的报酬。再，如果不给作者上演报酬，那么那写戏的人会挨饿，或者不得不找别的生路去了。二者的结果都同样对剧团不利，如果没有人肯写戏，剧团的工作就会受到影响。一个老剧作家对我讲，
  “过去，反动统治者使用各种办法来分裂进步剧团和作者的关系，然而我们却抱得很紧，互相支援。当时剧团的生活也是很苦的，但是剧团的人们总没有忘记为他们写戏的朋友，按期给我们上演报酬，使我们能够无后顾之忧，继续写戏。”
    然而，当时另外也有一种剧团经理，他们演了作者的剧本，是以不给上演报酬为荣的。他们常夸口当某些作者不得已，登门请求给予上演报酬的时候，他们能用许多聪明的搪塞办法，比如诉说生活苦，赔钱，头寸紧之类的话，把这笔微小的演出支出躲避过去。这种人自命为“吃得开”的“铁算盘”，古今中外，多少作家碰见他们，就像被掐住了喉咙一样地没有办法。曾经有一个导演遇见这样一位剧团“经理”，便问他为什么不给某一个剧作家上演报酬？他神气活现地说：
      “有人给，你放心。”
      “谁？”
    “别的剧团会给。这点钱不算什么，可钱要用在正事上。再说，嘻，嘻，嘻，把这些人喂得太饱了也不好。”
    这些话引起我们极大的愤慨。但在这件事情上，这位剧团经理的话起着决定作用，我们仅能愤慨而已。我记得当时从上海给我寄来一张剪下来的申报，上面登载着我的四个剧本同时在上海上演的广告，但是接信的那一天，我正在重庆临江的一个小茶棚里，靠一碗沱茶和几个烧饼过了一整天。那时候的作家在那种黑暗的社会里，不愿意也不能去质问，因为反正是没有用的。
    如今自然是一切都不同了，这种剧团“经理”早已不在戏剧圈子里面了，文艺工作者的劳动受到了极大的尊重，但不给剧作者上演报酬的现象还在很多的剧院、剧团里遗留着。据说，有一个描写农业生产合作社的剧本在全国上演了一千多场，但是作者没有从剧本的上演中得到任何的收入。又有一部描写长征的剧本在东北某一个剧团演出，演出的收入有四、五万元，但这位作者也没有从这剧团得到一点劳动的报酬。这类事情是举不胜举的。我自己写过几个戏，有时在有些城市上演。除了北京和上海两个地方的一些演出之外，很少剧团通知过我，有的想起来通知我，也是绝口不提上演报酬的。
    有一位老剧作家对我讲，他曾经“厚着脸皮”托人辗转向一个剧团询问他的剧本的上演报酬，因为这个剧团把他的剧本在上海、江苏、各大小城市上演了多次。但是他所得到的回答是：不理。那个老剧作家本想再问一问，但又怕被人说成“有资产阶级思想，动不动就谈钱”，就不肯多问了。
    但是正因为这类不给报酬的事情时时刻刻在全国各地发生着，不免有一些作者亲自找到剧团的负责人问过。但是他得到的并不是上演的报酬，也不是闪避，而是比什么理由都响亮的回答：
      “我们没给过！”
    有的剧团负责人是比较客气的；他托人很委曲婉转地转告那剧作者：
      “对不起，我们的预算没有这一条。”
    另一种剧团负责人则比较豪气，为了免得“啰苏”，他吩咐会计：
    “干脆给他个整数，二百元，算了！”
    但也有作风比较细致的人，当一个演员问他为什么不给剧作者上演报酬时，他沉稳地说：
    “等他们来要嘛！”
    后来作者果然去要了，但接到的回信上面写着：
    “我们要给的，但是没有见到上演报酬条例，不知道该怎样给。所以，……很抱歉。……”
    “没有见到上演报酬条例”就不能给吗？这是托词。
    话剧工作者都知道按时付给剧作者上演报酬是话剧事业中的良好惯例，今天很有些剧院剧团也一直是这样做的。据我所知，就有中央戏剧学院、中国青年艺术剧院、北京人民艺术剧院、上海人民艺术剧院、上海电影演员剧团和北京实验话剧团（特别要指出，这是一个民营的话剧团）。他们这样作，是因为他们认为这不是一个条例公布与否的问题，而是道义上应尽的责任问题。因为他们自己是艺术劳动者，也尊重别人的艺术劳动。他们这样作不只使剧作家感谢他们，也鼓励了创作，帮助了创作的繁荣。
    然而也该认识，这些拒绝给予上演报酬的剧院、剧团负责人全是革命的文艺工作者，很多是对革命有过贡献的好同志。他们勤勤恳恳，任劳任怨，多年从事于各种革命工作。我想像得出他们在土地改革工作中无情地斗争过地主，在五反运动中严正地斗争过不法的资本家们。他们在戏剧的组织工作中付出无私的劳动，为了工作，他们可以一夜一夜地熬红了眼睛，吃不下饭去。他们和本文前面提到的过去那些剧团“经理”们是绝对不能相提并论的，因为一个是忠诚的革命干部，一个是以铁算盘自夸的艺术商人。但，对剧作家来说，其不能帮助他们安心创作的效果却是一样的。
    今天的剧院剧团负责人不给剧作者上演报酬，也许是由于疏忽，也许是因为他们认为剧团是国家办的，应该涓滴归公，剧作家个人的报酬问题也应该服从于人民整体的利益。自然，也可能有其他的想法。但无论如何，他们忘记了一点，那就是：剧作家和他们一样，是劳动者。由于他们拒绝给予剧作家上演报酬，剧作家们受到不少的痛苦和烦恼。突出的例子是，有些有成就、有前途的剧作家放弃了话剧写作，有的改写小说，有的去当编辑去了。但这不能怪他们，因为人的劳动必须要有一定的生活资料才能维持得下去的。
    的确，还有不少人在写戏，但严格地说来，他们全都是业余的剧作者，那就是：他们是依靠薪水或者剧作以外的收入来生活的。我们有职业的小说家，有职业的诗人，但是拥有六亿人口的新中国，却没有一个职业的剧作家。我们听说文化部直接间接领导的国营的话剧剧团、剧院有四十几个，另外还有许多民营的话剧团和其他公开卖票的话剧演出。但这些，都不能培养出一个职业的剧作家，使他能够靠自己的上演报酬，维持合理的生活，安心写作，这是非常奇怪的事情。
    打破这样的陋规，让中国出现职业的剧作家吧！这对戏剧创作的繁荣会有好处的。
