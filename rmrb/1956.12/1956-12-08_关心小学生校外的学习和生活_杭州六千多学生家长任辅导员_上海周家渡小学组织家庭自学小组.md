Caring for Elementary School Students' Extracurricular Learning and Life
　　Over Six Thousand Student Parents in Hangzhou Serve as Counselors
    Shanghai Zhoujiadu Elementary School Organizes Family Self-Study Groups

    Xinhua News Agency News: More than six thousand elementary school parent counselors have emerged in Hangzhou this semester.

    This semester, Hangzhou City began implementing universal compulsory elementary education, and the number of school-age children enrolling in school has greatly increased. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient existing school buildings, 166 elementary schools in the city have implemented a two-shift teaching system. These elementary schools have organized more than 60,000 children who cannot attend classes for half a day into more than 8,000 family self-study activity groups, and selected more than 6,000 parents who love and care for children's learning to serve as counselors. These parent counselors actively help schools solve the problems of locations, utensils, and activity venues needed for children's half-day self-study, and urge children to study on time and carry out various beneficial activities.

    This newspaper reports: After the Zhoujiadu Elementary School in Dongchang District, Shanghai, implemented the two-shift system, it organized family self-study groups to provide students with a stable place to study outside of school, which has had a good effect on improving students' ideological character and academic performance.

    Zhoujiadu Elementary School began implementing the two-shift system in 1953. When the two-shift system was first implemented, Groups A and B alternated classes. One group of students left school to go home, and another group of students entered the school for classes. The school gate was extremely crowded, especially on rainy days. The two groups of students crowded into the school, which not only affected students' safety but also disrupted classroom order. Students' lives outside of school lacked proper management. After finishing class, some students wandered the streets, and some went everywhere to play, affecting social order.

    Zhoujiadu Elementary School adopted a rotation method for the same grade level and divided family self-study groups according to the distance of students' residences and routes to school. It requested the assistance of street residents' committees to select parents who loved children and cared for children's learning to serve as counselors. These parent counselors actively helped schools solve the problems of locations, utensils, and activity venues needed for family self-study groups, and urged children to study on time and carry out a variety of beneficial activities. These family self-study groups have had a good effect on students' ideological character and academic performance. Incidents of students affecting social order have decreased, and the number of students repeating grades in the school has decreased from 16% to 4%.

    In order to obtain the assistance of street residents' committees and parents, small parent meetings are held every week based on family self-study groups to seek more help from parents.

    上海周家渡小学组织家庭自学小组
    新华社讯　杭州市在这个学期出现了六千多个小学家长辅导员。
    这个学期，杭州市开始实施小学普及义务教育，学龄儿童入学人数大大增加。为了解决原有校舍不足的困难，全市有一百六十六个小学实行了二部制教学。这些小学把六万多个半天不能上课的儿童，组织成八千多个家庭自学活动小组，选聘了六千多个热爱儿童、关心儿童学习的家长担任辅导员。这些家长辅导员都积极帮助学校解决儿童半日自学所需要的地点、用具以及活动的场所，并且督促儿童按时自学和进行各种有益的活动。
    本报讯　上海市东昌区周家渡小学在实行二部制以后，为了使学生在校外有安定的学习地方，组织了家庭自学小组，对提高学生思想品质，学习成绩起了良好效果。
    周家渡小学在1953年开始实行二部制。在开始实行二部制的时候，甲、乙两部交叉上课，一批学生离校回家，一批学生进校上课，校门口拥挤不堪，特别是下雨的日子，两批学生拥挤在学校里，不但影响学生的安全，而且也扰乱了教室秩序。学生校外生活缺乏妥善管理。学生上完课以后，有的游荡街头，有的到处去玩，影响社会秩序。
    周家渡小学采用同阶段轮换办法，并按照学生住址远近和到校路线，划分家庭自学小组，请街道居民委员会协助选聘热爱儿童，关心儿童学习的家长担任辅导员。这些家长辅导员们都积极帮助学校解决家庭自学小组需要的地点、用具以及活动的场所问题，并督促儿童按时自学和进行多种多样有益的活动。这些家庭自学小组，对学生的思想品质、学习成绩起了良好的作用。学生影响社会秩序的事件减少了，全校留级的学生由16％减少到4％。
    为了取得街道居民委员会和家长们的协助，每星期以家庭自学小组为单位，召开小型家长会，争取家长们更多的帮助。
