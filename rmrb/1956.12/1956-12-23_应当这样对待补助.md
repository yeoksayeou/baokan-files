    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 22nd - In the various workshops of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, diligent and simple people are praised everywhere.

    Many workers in the mechanical workshop went to the trade union to request commendation for Su Guangming. This experienced veteran worker often helps others improve their work and technical skills. Although he is a member of the factory's trade union, and the factory stipulates that he has sixteen hours of trade union activity time per month, he has never asked for these hours to be deducted, and always conscientiously completes his own production tasks.

    The story of Han Xisheng, a worker in the locomotive workshop, returning his subsidy has become a popular tale. Han Xisheng owed more than one hundred yuan due to his family's frequent illnesses. The factory decided to help him pay off the entire debt. However, he had already received six months of retroactive wages. At this time, he thought that since the state had given me retroactive wages, I no longer needed the factory to subsidize me more than one hundred yuan; seventy yuan would be enough. Therefore, he decided to return more than thirty yuan of the subsidy.

    应当这样对待补助
    新华社哈尔滨22日电　哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂的各个车间里，勤恳朴素的人到处受人赞扬。
    机械车间不少工人到工会去请求表扬苏广铭。因为这个有经验的老工人，经常在工作中帮助别人改进工作，提高技术。他虽然是厂工会的委员，厂里规定他每月有十六小时的工会活动时间，但是他从来没有要求扣除这些时间，总是兢兢业业地完成自己的生产任务。
    机车车间工人韩锡生退回补助费的事已经传为美谈。韩锡生因为家属常生病欠下了一百多元的债。工厂决定帮他全部还清。但是他已经领到了六个月的追补工资。这时他想，国家给我追补了工资，就不需要工厂补助我一百多元，有七十元就够了。于是他决定退回三十多元的补助费。
