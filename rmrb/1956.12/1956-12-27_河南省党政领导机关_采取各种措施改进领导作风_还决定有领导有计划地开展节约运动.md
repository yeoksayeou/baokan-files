    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 26th: The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Henan Provincial People's Committee recently decided to adopt a series of measures to improve leadership style, promote hard work and plain living, and vigorously carry out a thrift campaign.

    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to turn the practice of drawing cadres from leading organs to regularly go to the countryside and factories to help with work into a system, which will be consistently implemented. In addition, a clear division of labor has been made between the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee. The Provincial Party Committee will focus on strengthening the leadership of the government work ideologically, politically, and strategically, and reduce routine administrative work, to further enhance the role of the Provincial People's Committee. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee will also take measures to strengthen the handling of letters and visits from the people, simplify transmittal procedures, and abolish guard posts, to make it easier to strengthen ties with the people.

    In order to overcome the phenomenon of large and bloated provincial-level organs, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Henan Provincial People's Committee decided to streamline the staff of provincial-level organs by one-third, and the streamlined personnel will be assigned to lower levels. Currently, the six offices under the Provincial People's Committee, including industry, finance, food, and trade, have been abolished. In the future, Party and government organs will generally stop setting up new institutions. If individual units need to add institutions, they must report to the provincial and municipal leading organs or even the central government for approval. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee require all administrative and enterprise units to strictly control their staffing quotas, not to encroach on each other's quotas, and not to casually absorb new personnel who are detached from production. Cadres who had been ordered to transfer to the Provincial Department of Industry but have not yet taken office, it has now been decided not to transfer.

    The Party and government leading organs of Henan Province have also decided to launch a vigorous campaign to practice strict economy and oppose extravagance and waste in a planned and organized way. At present, they are resolutely stopping the phenomenon of spending money recklessly at the end of the year. In the future, publicly-owned houses of the directly subordinate organs of the province will generally no longer be newly built, but will be used in a unified and regulated way, and the phenomenon of some units selling publicly-owned houses without authorization will be stopped. Furniture will generally no longer be purchased, but will be regulated and used on the basis of existing furniture. The purchase of cars, motorcycles, sofas, etc. will be stopped. Except for entertaining foreign guests, it is strictly forbidden to use public funds for entertaining and gift-giving. The Provincial Party Committee has also decided to strictly control meetings, save on long-distance telephone and telegram expenses, and the standard for public miscellaneous expenses should be reduced by 20% compared with the current expenses. The Provincial Party Committee has also instructed the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee to be responsible for rectifying and reviewing various books and periodicals run by various departments at the provincial level, and those with repetitive content or poor quality should be suspended or merged.

    河南省党政领导机关
    采取各种措施改进领导作风
    还决定有领导有计划地开展节约运动
    新华社郑州26日电　中共河南省委员会和河南省人民委员会最近决定采取一系列的措施，来改进领导作风，提倡艰苦朴素，大力开展节约运动。
    中共河南省委员会已决定把从领导机关抽调干部经常下乡下厂帮助工作这种作法，变成一种制度，经常贯彻执行。另外，省委和省人民委员会之间也作了明确分工，省委着重从思想上、政治上以及方针上加强对政府工作的领导，减少日常事务工作，以进一步发挥省人民委员会的作用。同时，省委还采取措施加强人民来信来访工作，简化传达手续，撤销门岗，使更便于加强同人民群众的联系。
    为了克服省级机关庞大臃肿的现象，中共河南省委员会和河南省人民委员会决定把省级机关工作人员精简三分之一，精简下来的人员将被充实到下层去。目前，省人民委员会所属工业、财粮贸等六个办公室已经撤销。今后党和政府机关一律停止设置机构，如个别单位需要增设机构，要报省、市领导机关以至中央批准。省委和省人民委员会要求各行政、企业单位严格控制编制，不能互相侵占名额，也不准随便吸收新的脱离生产的人员。过去已经下令调到省工业厅工作尚未到职的干部，现在已经决定不调了。
    河南省党、政领导机关还决定有领导有计划地和大张旗鼓地开展一个厉行节约、反对铺张浪费的运动。目前，正坚决制止年终乱花钱的现象。今后省直属机关公用房屋一般不再新建，要统一调剂使用，制止某些单位擅自转卖公用房屋的现象。家具一般的不再增购，在现有基础上加以调剂使用。汽车、摩托车、沙发等停止购置。除招待外宾外，一律不准用公款请客、送礼。省委并决定严格控制会议，节约长途电话、电报费用，公杂费开支标准应较现行开支降低20％。省委并责成省委宣传部负责整顿审查省级各部门所办的各种书报刊物，凡是内容重复或质量低劣的，予以停办或合并。
