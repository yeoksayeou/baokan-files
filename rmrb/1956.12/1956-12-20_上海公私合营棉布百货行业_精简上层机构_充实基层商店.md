Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Dispatch. In the socialist high tide of this spring, Shanghai's public-private jointly operated cotton fabric and department store industries, in order to lead the socialist transformation work of grassroots stores, established more than eighty public-private jointly operated district stores and district work groups, with nearly a thousand management personnel. This was necessary at the time; however, after the high tide, the institutions appeared bloated and wasteful.

Now, these two industries have been reduced to thirty district stores, reducing nearly half of the management personnel. This alone can save more than 33,000 yuan per month in administrative management expenses. Leadership style has also improved.

Most of the more than four hundred and fifty management personnel streamlined from the district stores have been assigned to grassroots stores to strengthen the stores' workforce. The Yu Feng Cotton Fabric Store in Huangpu District used to have only four and a half salespersons regularly in the store, making it difficult to serve the many customers. Now, the number has been increased to seven or eight salespersons per day. The Da Chang Xiang Cotton Fabric Store recently transferred a deputy section chief from the district store to serve as the deputy director of the store. Because this deputy director has considerable experience in procurement, he has been able to procure the cotton fabrics needed by consumers in a timely manner, changing the long-term situation of supply falling short of demand in the retail department.

    上海公私合营棉布百货行业
    精简上层机构  充实基层商店
    据新华社上海电　上海市公私合营的棉布和百货行业在今春社会主义高潮中，为了领导基层商店的社会主义改造工作，曾成立了八十多个公私合营的区店和区工作组，有近千名管理人员。当时这样做是必要的；但是高潮过后，机构就显得臃肿和浪费。
    现在，这两个行业缩减到三十个区店，减少了近一半的管理人员，仅行政管理费用开支每月就可节约三万三千多元。领导作风也有了改进。
    从区店精简下来四百五十多名管理人员大部分被分配到基层商店去充实商店力量。黄浦区裕丰棉布店，过去在店里的经常只有四个半营业员，难于照顾众多的顾客，现在已增加到每天有七、八个营业员。大昌祥棉布店新近从区店调来一个副股长当店副主任，由于这位副店主任在采购方面颇有经验，及时采购到消费者所需的棉布，改变了门市部长期供不应求的现象。
