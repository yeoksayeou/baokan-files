　　Strolling Through "Book Forest"
　　Shi Duan

　　Half a year ago, during my spare time or on holidays, I would occasionally visit the antique bookstores in Hangzhou and spend a yuan or eighty cents to pick up a few old books to read. Back then, books were indeed cheap. Three or five yuan could buy a beautifully printed collection of poems and essays from the early Qing Dynasty; Ming Dynasty books printed on white cotton paper cost only a few or a few dozen yuan each. I once bought a copy of "A New Account of Tales of the World" printed on white cotton paper during the Wanli period by Deng Yuanyue for only six yuan. Now, I only occasionally visit these stores. It's not because I've lost interest, but rather: firstly, I can't afford it, as book prices have increased several to dozens of times in the past half year; secondly, I can't find anything to buy, as almost everything except old textbooks has been bundled up and carted away by antique bookstores from other places, with names like so-and-so Pavilion or so-and-so Studio, leaving the shelves often "empty."

　　Ancient books are an extremely important part of China's cultural heritage, and the antique book industry plays an important role in the collection, preservation, and circulation of these books. This should be affirmed. In the past, ancient books and the industry were incorrectly treated, such as being priced by weight or being forced to change professions, which was certainly wrong. Currently, some regions are still indifferent to ancient books, and create difficulties for book seekers, indicating that this problem is still very serious. Comrade Xidi has loudly called for attention to this issue in "Wandering Through Book Forest," and I fully support this. However, I also feel that this is only one aspect of the problem; another rather important issue that needs to be emphasized is the leadership and transformation of the antique book industry.

　　What are some of the problems in this area? Judging from the situation in Hangzhou, there seem to be at least the following: (1) The price of ancient books. It is difficult to calculate the cost of ancient books, and it is impossible to stipulate a certain profit margin like with brown sugar and white sugar; however, there should be a reasonable price ratio between them and other commodities, and between different varieties of the same commodity (different versions, printing paper and ink, etc.). I think this is also certain. Currently, antique bookstores can arbitrarily bargain and raise prices, creating a state of "anarchy." A copy of "Jiangnan Jinglue" written by Zheng Ruozeng of the Ming Dynasty was purchased for only a few dozen yuan, but offered for sale at a price of one thousand yuan, and finally sold to Laixun Pavilion for a high price of four hundred yuan; what is the documentary value of the seventy-two volumes of the literary magazine "Wen Xin" published during the period of the puppet regime? Simply because they are rare, they were actually sold for two hundred yuan; a common version of Gao Youwang's "Reading Magazine" was initially offered for eight yuan, but the second time it was offered for thirty-two yuan; even two small volumes of "Hunchback Collection" (original price one yuan and one dime) were sold for more than ten yuan! What kind of prices are these! Why is such an important policy issue as the price of ancient books being manipulated by private merchants who are nominally jointly owned by public and private entities, but have not yet undergone significant transformation? After the full industry has become a joint public-private venture, the quality of commodities in other industries is gradually improving and prices are decreasing; is it completely normal for the "commodities" in this industry alone to be soaring wildly? (2) The method of operation. It is true that large quantities of ancient books are scattered in cities and villages, and it is sometimes heard that some extremely valuable books and documents are being destroyed as waste paper. The employees of the antique book industry go deep into the countryside to collect these ancient books, "rescue" them from destruction, and preserve and circulate them, which is doing something beneficial to the people. It is true that several antique bookstores in Hangzhou have "rescued" many Taiping Heavenly Kingdom documents from waste paper. I believe this is the correct direction for the antique book industry's business methods. But this is not the case now. They rarely actually go deep into the countryside to collect and "rescue" books; instead, they engage in mutual purchasing and multi-layered reselling between bookstores. Booksellers from Beijing and Shanghai flock to Hangzhou, rent warehouses, entertain guests, and take them on tours of the lake, raising book prices (for example, if the bookstore originally priced a book at one yuan, they give one yuan and two dimes, fearing that the book price will not rise) to engage in large-scale purchasing; and the Hangzhou booksellers in turn flock to Shaoxing, Ningbo, Jiangxi, and Hunan; and the Hangzhou bookstores engage in mutual purchasing among themselves. It is just these few books that you sell to me and I sell to you. The result, in addition to the book price rising several to dozens of times out of thin air, the antique book industry making unprecedented profits, and the buyers (public and private) suffering losses, how much benefit does this bring to the cultural cause? This is worth calmly considering. How much difference is there between this business method and the business methods of speculators in the old society? (3) The education of private personnel. Wholeheartedly serving the people and serving China's cultural cause should be the work attitude and purpose of private personnel in the antique book industry after joint public-private ownership, right? But some private personnel are not engaging in their work with this attitude and purpose. For example, one antique bookstore with a large collection of books has been hoarding a large number of ancient books for a long time since liberation in order to seek high prices, and it has recently been discovered that six thousand catties of ancient books have been completely ruined by worms. What a great loss! What a great crime!

　　Strolling through "Book Forest," I have gained some insights and written them down haphazardly for the relevant departments to refer to. If this can attract attention, it would also be a great blessing for "Book Forest."

### 偶步“书林”

　　偶步“书林”
　　史断
    半年以前，工余或者例假的时候，我偶尔也跑跑杭州的古书店，花上一元、八角，拾几本古旧书籍回来看看。那时的书价确实便宜，三、五块钱可以买到一部清初精刻的诗文集；白棉纸的明版书，也只不过几块钱或几十块钱一部。我买过一部万历年间邓原岳刻的白棉纸的“世说新语”，就只花了六块钱。现在，我是偶尔又偶尔地跑跑了。倒不是没有兴趣，而是：一则买不起，书价半来年上涨几倍到几十倍；二则买不到，几乎除了旧教课书，其他的都被外地的什么阁、什么斋之类的古书店大捆小捆地捆载而去，书架上有时“空空如也”。
    古籍是我国文化遗产的极为重要的一部分，古书业对于古籍的搜集、保存和流通起着重要作用，这都是应该肯定的。古籍及其行业过去曾经一度被不正确地对待过，如论斤计价，强迫改行之类，这当然不对。目前有的地区对古籍尚漠不关心，对访书者多方作难，可见这方面的问题尚很严重。西谛同志在“漫步书林”中曾为此大声疾呼，这我完全护拥。但是我又觉得这只是问题的一个方面；还有一个相当重要的问题需要重视起来，即对于古书业的领导和改造问题。
    这中间存在一些什么问题呢？就杭州的情况来看，似乎至少有这样几个问题：（一）古籍的价格问题。古籍是很难计算成本的，也不能像红糖白糖那样规定毛利几分；但它与其他商品之间、同一商品的不同品种（版本不同，印刻纸墨不同等）之间应该有一定的合理比价，我想这也是肯定的。现在，古书店可以任意讨价和抬价，成了“无政府状态”。一本明朝郑若曾著的“江南经略”，收进只有几十块钱，出卖时讨价千元，终于以四百元高价卖给来熏阁；七十二册敌伪时期出版的文艺杂志“文心”，有什么文献价值呢？只因少见，居然也卖了二百元；一部普通版本的高邮王氏的“读书杂志”，第一次讨价八元，第二次就要三十二元；连两小册的“佝偻集”（原价一元一角）也要卖到十几元，这些是什么价格！为什么把古籍价格这样一个重要的政策问题，操纵在名义上已经公私合营、实质上尚未进行重大改造的私商手里？全业公私合营以后，其他行业的商品都在逐步提高质量，降低价格；独有这一行业的“商品”狂涨不已，这现象是否完全正常？（二）经营的方式问题。城市和农村的确散存着大批古籍，有些极有价值的书籍和文献当作废纸在毁掉，这也时有所闻。古书业的从业人员深入民间，把这些古籍收购上来，从毁灭中“抢救”出来，加以保存和流通，这是在做对人民有益的事情。杭州也确有几家古书店从废纸里“抢救”出不少太平天国的文献。我认为这是古书业经营方式上的正确方向。但现在却不是如此，他们很少真正深入到民间去收购和“抢救”了；而代替以书店与书店之间的互相套购，层层转贩。北京、上海的书商大批拥到杭州来，包了栈房，请客、游湖，抬高书价（如原书店标价一元，他们给一元二角，唯恐书价不涨）大事套购；杭州的又大批拥到绍兴、宁波、江西、湖南去；杭州各书店之间又互相套购。就是这几本书，你贩来，我贩去，所得的结果，除了书价凭空涨了几倍到几十倍，古书业获得空前利润，购买者
  （公家和私人）倒霉以外，对文化事业究竟有多大益处，这是值得冷静考虑的。这一经营方式究竟与旧社会的投机商的经营方式有多大差别？（三）对私方人员的教育问题。全心全意为人民服务、为中国的文化事业服务，这应该是公私合营后的古书业中私方人员的工作态度和目的吧。但现在有些私方人员却不是抱着这样的态度和目的来从事工作的。如有一家存书很多的古书店，为了谋取高价，解放以来长期把大批古籍囤积不卖，最近已经发现有六千斤古籍被虫蛀得完全不能用了，这是多大的损失！多大的罪恶！
    偶步“书林”，略有所得，拉杂写出，供有关方面参考。倘能引起注意，亦“书林”一大幸事。
