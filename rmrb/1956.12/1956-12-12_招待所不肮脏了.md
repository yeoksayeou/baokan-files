Response to Criticism

    The Guesthouse is No Longer Dirty
    Letter from the Changchun Municipal People's Committee Guesthouse: The criticism in the letter "Dirty Guesthouse" published in the People's Daily on November 1st is completely correct, and we accept it. The sanitation and service attitude of our guesthouse have now changed. In the future, we must continue to work hard and overcome shortcomings, so as to truly satisfy our guests in our practical work.

    招待所不肮脏了
    长春市人民委员会招待所来信：人民日报11月1日发表的“肮脏的招待所”一信对我所的批评是完全正确的，我们表示接受。现在我所的卫生情况和服务态度已有了改变，今后我们一定要继续努力、克服缺点，以便在实际工作中真正做到使客人满意。
