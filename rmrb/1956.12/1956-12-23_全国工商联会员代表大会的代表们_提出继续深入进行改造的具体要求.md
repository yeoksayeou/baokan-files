Xinhua News Agency, December 21st. Many representatives from industry and commerce, at the Second Members' Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce today, put forward specific opinions on how to continue to deepen transformation in the future.

    Bi Mingqi, a representative from Tianjin, introduced five requirements proposed by the Tianjin representatives as a guideline for them to continue to accept transformation in the future. For example: sincerely accept the leadership of the public side in the relationship between public and private cooperation, actively propose suggestions and methods for work, be consistent in words and deeds, and be open and honest with each other; be dutiful and responsible in work, actively participate in socialist competitions with employees, contribute personal skills to the country without reservation, and overcome arrogance, complacency, and the passive ideology and style of seeking no merit but avoiding mistakes.

    Bi Mingqi also, on behalf of the representatives from Tianjin, discussed their understanding and experience of the important issues discussed at this meeting. He said: It is not enough to join the trade union simply by removing the label of "capitalist"; the key is whether one can work hard and transform one's thinking with a positive attitude. Regarding the issue of fixed interest, he believes that one cannot be satisfied with fixed interest income and relax the preparation for changing oneself into a self-reliant worker in the future. He said:
  “After we receive the fixed interest, in addition to the necessary living expenses, we should try our best to use the surplus appropriately to do some things that are beneficial to the construction of the motherland and for the welfare of the people.”

    The发言 of the Qinghai Provincial Delegation indicated that the Qinghai representatives will transform themselves by working hard in studying, improving the relationship between public and private cooperation, actively assisting in the establishment and participation in enterprise management committees, carrying out socialist competitions, and practicing strict economy. Liu Peizhi, a representative from Heilongjiang Province, and Chen Zhimin, a representative from Guizhou Province, respectively expressed the willingness of the representatives from the two provinces to strengthen transformation in the future. Liu Jingji and Liu Nianyi, representatives from Shanghai, examined their own shortcomings in their speeches, such as the deeply rooted capitalist management style due to being educated in capitalism in the past, the greater distance from the working people in ideology due to a long period of living an exploitative life, the more serious view of despising labor, and the easy growth of extravagant and wasteful styles such as pursuing material enjoyment and emphasizing ostentation. They proposed to strengthen the study of political theory, strive to gradually change the old positions, viewpoints, and styles in the practical work of enterprises, develop thrifty habits in life, practice careful calculation in production and management, and humbly and sincerely unite with small and medium-sized industrialists and merchants, learn from each other, and help each other. Xiao Zeke and Lin Quanjun, representatives from Sichuan Province, presented four aspects of their future efforts to the congress. Xia Tianjin, Fan Yueqin, Hong Xijuan, Yan Peizhen, and Yang Jianqing, family members of industrialists and merchants in Shanghai, also proposed to learn the hard-working and thrifty lifestyle of the working class and practice diligence and thrift in managing their families.

    Many representatives also reflected the problems existing in various aspects of work and put forward suggestions in their speeches today. Lu Guangji, Jiang Peilv, Liu Zhenting, Li Jingshan, Wang Diange, Yang Zhubo, Hou Qixing, Hu Xianwen, Han Shanwen, and Jia Jinrong, ten representatives from Liaoning Province, suggested in a joint speech that the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce should adapt to the requirements of the new situation, strengthen its work, change its style, and provide comprehensive leadership. Yu Pinsan, Fu Zicheng, Wang Zhaoqing, Zhu Shaoqing, and Fu Jintang, representatives from Henan Province, put forward six suggestions in a joint speech on how to resolve the contradiction between the enterprise work and social activities of industrialists and merchants. For example, use a small number of people who are full-time or part-time, so that the majority can work more in enterprises with peace of mind; reduce concurrent positions, and assign positions in various aspects to as many people as possible; reduce duplicate meetings by holding joint meetings, etc. In their joint written speech, Xu Juemin, Zou Jiaji, Fei Qinggang, and Heng Yingyuan, representatives from Shaanxi Province, put forward opinions on the arrangements for small vendors and auxiliary labor in southern Shaanxi, as well as the purchase of mountain goods and local products and rural products. Luo Anping and Qin Binghua, representatives from Guizhou Province, reflected the difficulties in the lives, studies, and sources of goods of small vendors in their written speeches, and put forward solutions. Huang Mengfei, a representative from Anhui Province, put forward five suggestions in his written speech on how to solve the livelihood difficulties of some industrialists and merchants.
