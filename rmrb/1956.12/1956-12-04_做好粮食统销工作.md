　　Doing a Good Job in Grain Unified Purchase and Supply
    Adopting the Mass Line in Grain Unified Purchase and Supply
    Regarding grain unified purchase and supply, as of the 20th of this month, only 30% of grain-deficient agricultural cooperatives in Henan Province have completed assessment and sales, and issued grain purchase certificates; 70% of grain-deficient cooperatives are in the process of carrying out unified purchase and supply. Existing experience has proven that to do a good job in the unified purchase and supply of agricultural cooperatives, it is necessary to resolutely overcome the idea of cadres belittling the work of unified purchase and supply, adhere to the mass line, and have members of grain-deficient cooperatives elect fair and capable evaluation committee members to form an evaluation committee. Relying on the evaluation committee and cooperative cadres, verify the grain output within the cooperative. On the one hand, investigate and clarify the grain income of each household; on the other hand, implement the grain policy, especially the policy of guaranteeing reasonable supply. On the basis of alleviating the concerns of the masses and raising their awareness, balance surpluses and shortages within the cooperative, provide reasonable care for households with special difficulties, and then conduct self-reporting and evaluation, democratic consultation, and widely solicit opinions from members. The results of the evaluation and unified purchase and supply should first be tested and announced in the production team, make necessary corrections before being formally announced, and be submitted to the township (district) or county people's committee for review and approval as the final decision. Grain purchase certificates should be issued to each household, and state grain sales outlets should be responsible for supplying grain by area. The result of doing so is not only that the fixed sales figures are reasonable and reliable, but also that a phased grain purchase plan can be drawn up, embodying the spirit of "eat your own grain first, then eat the state's grain," making both cooperative cadres and members satisfied. At the same time, research should be conducted to improve livestock feeding and save feed, and members should be educated not to use feed, rations, and seed grain for sideline occupations.

        Grain Work Should Be Arranged in a Unified Way with Production Work and Distribution Work
    The key to doing a good job in the current grain unified purchase and supply work is to quickly control grain sales, strictly and systematically control grain supply, and appropriately restrain the objectively large increase in grain demand. Party and government leading organs at all levels should earnestly strengthen their leadership and management of grain unified purchase and supply work, reasonably control supply indicators based on actual needs, improve the grain supply system, and prevent the phenomenon of over-selling grain. At present, all localities should closely integrate the work of winter planting production in rural areas and the autumn harvest distribution of agricultural production cooperatives, and arrange grain requisition, purchase, and sales work in a unified manner, and do it at the same time. It would create just as many difficulties for rural grain work if we only completed the task of grain requisition and purchase, but did not do a good job in grain unified purchase and supply work. Therefore, on the one hand, the standard of grain retention in rural areas should be set at a reasonable level to avoid excessive grain retention and create a false phenomenon of grain shortage; on the other hand, when arranging the unified sales quota for grain-deficient cooperatives, we should continue to implement the principle of eating our own grain first and then eating the state's grain, and supplying grain whenever there is a shortage. We should do a good job in monthly quantitative supply, calculate uniformly within the cooperative, and issue grain coupons to households on a monthly basis. We must not deliberately hoard or arbitrarily increase the grain supply quota.

　　做好粮食统销工作
    做粮食统销工作要走群众路线
    在粮食统销方面，截止本月20日，河南全省只有30％的缺粮社进行了评销，颁发了购粮凭证；70％的缺粮社正在进行统销工作。根据已有的经验证明，做好农业社的统销工作，必须坚决克服干部轻视统销工作的思想，坚持走群众路线，由缺粮社社员，推选公正能干的评议委员组成评议委员会，依靠评议委员会和社干部，查实社内粮食产量，一方面逐户摸底弄清粮食收入，一方面贯彻粮食政策，特别是贯彻保证合理供应的政策，在群众顾虑解除觉悟提高的基础上，做好社内平衡余缺，对特殊困难户给予合理照顾，然后进行自报评议，民主协商，广泛征求社员意见。评议统销结果先在生产队中试验公布，进行必要修正后再正式公布，经社员大会通过并报乡（区）或县人民委员会审查批准后作为最后定案，分户发给购粮凭证，由国家的售粮点分片定点负责供应。这样做的结果，不仅定销数字合理可靠，并且可以订出分期购粮计划，体现了“先吃自己的，后吃国家的”精神，使社干部和社员都能够满意。同时，对改善牲畜喂养、节约饲料也要进行研究，并教育社员不能用饲料、口粮和种子粮搞副业。

        粮食工作要与生产工作、分配工作统一安排
    做好当前粮食统销工作的关键就是迅速控制粮食销量，对粮食供应加以严格的、有计划的控制，对客观上大量增加的粮食需要加以适当的节制。各地党政领导机关应当认真地加强对粮食统销工作的领导和管理，从实际需要出发，合理地控制供应指标，健全粮食供应制度，制止粮食超销现象。目前，各地要密切结合农村冬种生产和农业生产合作社秋收分配的工作，把粮食征、购、销工作统一安排，同时做好。只完成粮食征购任务，不做好粮食统销工作，是同样会增加农村粮食工作的很多困难的。因此，一方面要把农村的留粮标准放在合理的水平上，避免留粮过多而造成虚假的缺粮现象；另一方面，在安排缺粮社的统销指标的时候，应该继续贯彻执行先吃自己粮后吃国家粮、几时缺粮几时供应的原则，做好分月定量供应，由社内统一计算，按月发放粮票到户，不能够故意积压或随意增大粮食供应指标。
