A Striking Contrast
Two Party members who made the same mistake, one improved, one became passive due to different approaches by the Party organization.

Some rural Party members and cadres often make the mistake of coercion and commandism in their work, treating the masses with a simplistic and rude attitude, even beating and scolding them, causing dissatisfaction among the masses and damaging the work. The occurrence of this coercive commandism is certainly the responsibility of the grass-roots cadres who made the mistakes, but it is often inseparable from the subjectivism and bureaucracy of the leading organs. Therefore, when Party organizations deal with such mistakes, in addition to bearing the responsibilities they should bear, they should focus on ideological education for comrades who have made mistakes, and should not adopt a punitive approach; even for individual comrades whose mistakes are serious and require disciplinary action, they should be given enthusiastic care and assistance, and should not be discriminated against in any way. Only in this way can we help comrades who have made mistakes to recognize and correct their mistakes, without harming their political enthusiasm.

Here are two examples. Xue Dongchen, a Communist Party member from Xuexu Township, Taixing County, Jiangsu Province, was criticized in a county committee circular for serious coercion and commandism when establishing primary agricultural cooperatives in 1954. Afterwards, the secretary of the township Party branch continuously educated and helped him, explaining that Communist Party members are the servants of the people, not the masters of the people. Whenever he encountered difficulties in his work, he would specifically help him solve them, repeatedly explaining work methods to him, so that he gradually understood the importance of the mass line in practice. He was greatly moved, and not only did he not become passive, but he also overcame his past coercive command style, consulting with the masses in everything, and working very vigorously. For example, during the autumn harvest this year, it rained heavily continuously, and sorghum and millet were about to sprout in the fields. Comrade Xue Dongchen immediately convened a meeting of cooperative members to study methods of rushing the harvest, and as a result, more than eighty acres of sorghum and millet were saved from loss. Now, whenever the cooperative members mention Comrade Xue Dongchen, they give a thumbs up and say: "Secretary Xue is very different now. In the past, it was coercion and commandism, but now he is a good example of following the mass line."

Another Party member in this township, Wang Yulong, also made serious mistakes of coercion and commandism, and was given an administrative demotion due to corrupt behavior. After this, because the Party organization neither assigned him work nor educated him to correct his mistakes, he became passive and pessimistic, and refused to work. As a result, the masses had even more opinions about him.

This striking contrast shows that although the nature of the mistakes made by the two people was basically the same, because the Party organization adopted different treatment methods, one improved and one became passive. From this, it can be seen how important it is for Party organizations to correctly treat Party members who have made mistakes in order to unite comrades and do a good job.

　　鲜明的对
　　比两个犯了同样错误的党员，由于党组织采取了不同的对待方法，一个进步了，一个消极了。

    一些农村党员、干部，常常在工作中犯了强迫命令的错误，用简单化的粗暴的态度对待群众，甚至打骂群众，引起了群众的不满，使工作受到损失。这种强迫命令行为的发生，固然犯错误的基层干部要负责，但常常是同领导机关的主观主义和官僚主义分不开的。因此，党的组织在处理这类错误时，除了要担负起本身应当担负的责任以外，应该着重对犯错误的同志进行思想教育，而不应该采取惩办主义的作法；就是对于个别错误严重需要给予纪律处分的同志，也应当热情地关怀和帮助他们，而不应该对他们有任何歧视。只有这样，才能够帮助犯错误的同志认识和改正错误，而不致伤害他们的政治积极性。
    这里就有两个例子。江苏省泰兴县薛徐乡的共产党员薛栋臣，在1954年建立初级农业合作社时，由于严重的强迫命令，受到了县委的通报批评。以后乡党支部书记不断地对他进行教育和帮助，向他说明了共产党员是人民的勤务员，不是人民群众的老爷。每当他在工作中碰到困难时，就具体地帮助他解决，反复地向他交待工作方法，使他逐步地从实践中懂得了走群众路线的重要性。他受到很大的感动，不但没有消极下去，而且克服了过去的强迫命令作风，遇事都和群众商量，工作干得也很起劲。例如今年秋收时连续下大雨，高粱、粟子在地里要出芽，薛栋臣同志就立即召开社员座谈会，研究抢收方法，结果使八十多亩高粮、粟子避免了损失。现在社员只要提到薛栋臣同志，就把大姆指一伸说：薛社长大不相同了，过去是强迫命令，现在是走群众路线的好榜样。
    这个乡的另一个党员王余龙，同样也犯了严重的强迫命令错误，并因有腐化行为受到行政撤职处分。这以后，由于党的组织既没有给他分配工作，也没有教育他改正错误，因而他消极悲观，工作上躺倒不干。这样，群众对他就有了更多的意见。
    这一鲜明的对比说明了，虽然两个人所犯错误的性质基本相同，但因为党的组织采取了不同的对待方法，结果一个进步了，一个消极了。从这里可以看出，党的组织正确地对待犯错误的党员，对于团结同志和做好工作是多么的重要。
