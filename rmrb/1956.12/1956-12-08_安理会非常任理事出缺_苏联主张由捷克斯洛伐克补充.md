　　Vacancy for Non-Permanent Member of the Security Council
　　Soviet Union Proposes Czechoslovakia to Fill the Position
Xinhua News Agency, 7th - New York dispatch: The head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, Kuznetsov, held a press conference on the afternoon of the 6th to explain that the Soviet Union will support Czechoslovakia as a non-permanent member of the Security Council to succeed the vacancy left by Yugoslavia.

Kuznetsov emphasized that the Soviet Union fully supports the demand made by Asian and African countries at the Bandung Conference to increase the number of Asian and African countries represented on the Security Council, but he pointed out that this issue should not be resolved by reducing the number of representatives from Eastern European countries.

He said that Article 23 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that the non-permanent members of the Security Council should take into account geographical distribution, and the London Gentleman's Agreement of January 1946 further stipulates that one of the six non-permanent members must be assigned to an Eastern European country. In view of the increase in the number of member states in the Eastern European region since the last session of the United Nations General Assembly, it is especially necessary to guarantee the seat of Eastern Europe. He pointed out that the proposal to expand the number of non-permanent members must be considered on the premise of guaranteeing the principle of fair regional distribution of seats to Eastern European countries. The Soviet delegation will finally determine its attitude towards the proposal to expand the number of non-permanent members based on the results of the election to fill the vacancy left by Yugoslavia.

The United States is attempting to have the Philippines succeed the vacancy left by Yugoslavia. As early as the tenth session of the General Assembly, it had already begun this action to undermine the Charter and the London Agreement. At that session, it exerted pressure on many other countries, wanting to use the Philippines to exclude a seat of representation for Eastern European countries. After thirty-six ballots, it still did not obtain the necessary majority, and the majority of the delegates to the General Assembly elected Yugoslavia. However, the United States used its voting machine to change Yugoslavia's statutory term of office from two years to one year. And stipulated in advance that the other year would be succeeded by the Philippines.

　  安理会非常任理事出缺
　　苏联主张由捷克斯洛伐克补充
    新华社7日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫6日下午举行记者招待会，说明苏联将支持捷克斯洛伐克为安全理事会的非常任理事来接替南斯拉夫将留下来的空缺。
    库兹涅佐夫着重说，苏联完全支持亚非国家在万隆会议上所提出的要求增加亚非国家在安理会中的代表名额的要求，但是他指出，这件事不应当靠削减东欧国家的代表名额来解决。
    他说，联合国宪章第二十三条规定安理会的非常任理事应当斟酌地理区域分配，1946年1月的伦敦君子协定进一步规定在六个非常任理事中有一席必须分配给东欧国家。鉴于在联合国大会上届会议以后东欧地区的会员国又有了增加，保证东欧的席位就尤其需要。他指出，必须在保证对东欧国家实行按地区公平分配席位的原则的前提下，考虑扩大非常任理事的名额。苏联代表团将根据补充南斯拉夫缺额的选举结果来最后确定它对扩大非常任理事名额的建议的态度。
    美国企图以菲律宾来接替南斯拉夫将留下来的空缺。早在第十届大会的时候，它就已经开始了这种破坏宪章和伦敦协定的行动。在那届大会上，它曾对其他许多国家施加压力，想用菲律宾来排除东欧国家的一席代表权。在经过三十六次投票之后，它仍然没有得到必要的多数，而大会多数代表却选举了南斯拉夫。但是，美国却利用表决机器把南斯拉夫的法定任期由两年改为一年。并且预先规定其他的一年将由菲律宾接替。
