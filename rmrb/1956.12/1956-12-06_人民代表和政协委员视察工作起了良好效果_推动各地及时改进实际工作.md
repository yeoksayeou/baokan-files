Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. The suggestions for improving work made by the deputies of the National People's Congress and the members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) after their inspection work in the first half of this year have largely proven effective and have played a positive role in improving practical work.

Starting in the first half of last year, the deputies and members have conducted three inspections. In the first half of this year, a total of 518 deputies and members conducted inspections in 22 provinces, two autonomous regions, and three municipalities directly under the central government. Based on the problems discovered during the inspections, some criticisms and suggestions were raised at the Third Session of the First National People's Congress. In addition, 125 inspection reports were submitted, including a total of 1,555 problems and opinions on various tasks.

Most organizations have attached importance to the criticisms and suggestions of the deputies and members. Some suggestions, after being adopted, have led to timely improvements in work and production. For example, CPPCC National Committee member Wu Jue-nong discovered during an inspection in Zhejiang Province in the second half of last year that tea production had declined in some areas. He analyzed the reasons and put forward suggestions for improving tea garden cultivation. The relevant departments in Zhejiang Province attached great importance to his suggestions and decided that tea fields with dense canopies should not be intercropped with grain crops, and the grain "three-fixed" production quotas previously stipulated for tea fields should be cancelled. After taking this measure, the unit area yield of tea gardens has significantly increased.

Some organizations have also sent special personnel to investigate some more important issues and have handled them seriously. For example, Liu Qingyang and three other deputies criticized the Tangshan Steel Plant after inspecting it in the first half of this year for failing to install ventilation and cooling equipment in the workshops as planned. The Iron and Steel Industry Administration of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry conducted a special investigation into this matter and discussed it with the CPC Tangshan Municipal Committee, the Tangshan Municipal People's Committee, and the负责人 of the Tangshan Steel Plant. Later, the Iron and Steel Administration held a special meeting, inviting the director of the Tangshan Steel Plant to participate in the discussion. After in-depth investigation and research, the main problems were identified, and measures such as improving workshop skylights and using mechanical equipment for forced ventilation were taken, which improved the situation.

When Wu Yixiu and Hong Sisi, two deputies, inspected work in Tianjin, they found that some senior medical personnel among returned overseas Chinese were not appropriately assigned to jobs, preventing them from utilizing their expertise. For example, thoracic surgeons and dermatologists were assigned to treat general surgery, and pharmaceutical researchers were assigned to work in pharmacies; their residences were also crowded. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission attached great importance to these opinions and quickly sent responsible cadres to Tianjin to cooperate with the Tianjin Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau in carrying out inspection and handling. Those whose job assignments were inappropriate have now been reassigned, and those with crowded housing have been appropriately resolved. These medical personnel are very satisfied, and their work enthusiasm has been greatly improved.

When Fuzhou City carried out reforms in the bodiless lacquerware industry in July this year, it assessed the levels of famous artisans in bodiless lacquerware, lacquerware, wood carving, wood painting, stone carving, and porcelain sculpture industries, adjusted their wages, and made appropriate arrangements for how to train artisans in the future. These measures were taken based on the criticisms and suggestions made by Tian Fuda and two other deputies and members after inspecting the Fuzhou No. 1 Bodiless Lacquerware Production Cooperative. During the inspection, Deputy Tian Fuda and others found that the wages of some old artisans were the same as those of ordinary workers, which affected the enthusiasm of these old artisans in manufacturing new products. The Fuzhou Municipal People's Committee instructed relevant departments to inspect and handle this issue. After in-depth inspection, it was found that other handicraft industries had similar problems, so the above-mentioned measures were taken during the reform.

Among the problems and opinions raised by the deputies and members, some are important but cannot be handled temporarily and can be gradually handled in the future. The relevant departments have included them in their future work plans. For the problems raised by the deputies and members that do not match the situation or cannot be resolved, the relevant units have also promptly explained them to the deputies and members.

However, some organizations do not fully recognize the important significance and role of the inspection work of deputies and members, and have not conducted in-depth inspections and serious handling of the opinions raised by deputies and members. Some deputies and members have already raised criticisms about this.

### 人民代表和政协委员视察工作起了良好效果　推动各地及时改进实际工作

　　人民代表和政协委员视察工作起了良好效果
　　推动各地及时改进实际工作
    新华社5日讯　全国人民代表大会代表和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员在今年上半年视察工作以后提出的改进工作的意见，有许多已经行之有效，对改进实际工作起了良好的效果。
    从去年上半年开始，代表们和委员们已经进行过三次视察。今年上半年共有五百一十八位代表和委员，在二十二个省、两个自治区和三个直辖市进行了视察。根据视察所发现的问题，有些在第一届全国人民代表大会第三次会议上提出了批评和建议，另外提出了一百二十五份视察报告，在这些报告中，包括了对各项工作所提出的问题和意见共一千五百五十五条。
    大多数机关都重视代表们和委员们的批评和建议，有些建议被采纳以后，使工作和生产及时得到了改进。如政协全国委员会委员吴觉农去年下半年在浙江视察时，发现一些地区茶叶减产，他分析了原因，提出了改进茶园种植工作的意见。浙江省有关部门很重视他的意见，决定凡茶蓬密的茶田不要间作粮食作物，过去给茶田规定粮食“三定”产量的，予以取消。采取了这一措施以后，现在茶园的单位面积产量显著地提高了。
    有些机关对一些比较重要的问题还派专人调查，并且作了认真处理。如刘清扬等四位代表在今年上半年视察唐山钢厂后，就该厂没有按计划在车间安装通风降温设备等问题提出了批评意见。冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局即对此作了专门调查，并同中共唐山市委员会、唐山市人民委员会以及唐山钢厂负责人进行了研究。后来钢铁管理局又召开专门会议，吸收唐山钢厂厂长参加讨论。经过深入的调查研究，找出了存在的主要问题，采取了改进车间天窗、用机械设备强力通风等措施，这样就使情况改善了。
    吴益修、洪丝丝两代表在天津视察工作时，发现归国华侨中有些高级医务工作人员的工作分配得不恰当，不能发挥他们的专长，比如把胸外科和皮肤科的医师分配去主治一般外科，把研究制药学的分配到药房去工作；他们的住宅有的也很拥挤。华侨事务委员会很重视这些意见，迅速派了负责干部去天津协同天津市民政局进行检查处理，现在工作分配得不适当的已经另行安排，房子挤的也得到适当的解决。这些医务工作人员都很满意，他们的工作积极性大大提高了。
    福州市今年7月间在脱胎漆行业进行改革时，曾对脱胎、漆器、木刻、木画、石刻、瓷雕等行业的名艺人评定了等级，调整了工资，并对今后如何培养艺人问题作了适当的安排。这些措施是根据田富达等三位代表和委员在视察福州市第一脱胎漆器生产合作社以后提出的批评意见所采取的。田富达代表等在视察时，发现有些老艺人的工资和一般工人一样，以致影响到这些老艺人制造新产品的积极性。福州市人民委员会责成有关部门检查处理这个问题，经深入检查，发现其他手工业行业也有类似的问题，因而在改革时采取了上述措施。
    代表和委员们提出的问题和意见中，有一些重要的但是暂时还不能办理而将来可以逐步办理的，有关部门都已列入今后的工作规划中。对代表和委员们提出的与情况不符和无法解决的问题，有关单位也及时向代表和委员们作了说明。
    但是，也有些机关对代表和委员视察工作的重要意义和作用认识不足，对代表和委员所提出的意见没有进行深入的检查和认真的处理。有些代表和委员对此已经提出批评意见。
