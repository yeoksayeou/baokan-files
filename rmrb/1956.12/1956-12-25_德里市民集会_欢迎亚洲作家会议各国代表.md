Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 24th: The Delhi Municipal Committee held a citizens' welcoming meeting at the Delhi Municipal Hall on the evening of the 23rd to welcome representatives from various countries attending the Asian Writers' Conference.

    Delhi Municipal Committee Chairman Aggarwal, on behalf of the citizens of Delhi, welcomed the representatives, saying, "The very idea of Asian writers gathering together is a noble one—an idea full of hope for a resurgent Asia. It may give the solidarity of Asian and African countries born in Bandung two years ago and the Panchsheel a new meaning and importance."

    Mao Dun, head of the Chinese writers' delegation, thanked the Indian government and the citizens of Delhi for their warm hospitality during his speech. He also conveyed the Chinese people's friendly feelings towards the Indian people. He said that Sino-Indian friendship is a guarantee of world peace. Our friendship is based on the Panchsheel. Chinese writers, together with Indian writers, must use all their strength to strive for the prosperity and peace of Asia and the world.

    The heads of the delegations from Burma, Nepal, Japan, North Korea, Mongolia, Vietnam, and Dr. Nafisi from Iran also spoke at the meeting. They all expressed their gratitude to the citizens of Delhi for their warm welcome.

    德里市民集会
    欢迎亚洲作家会议各国代表
    新华社新德里24日电　德里市政委员会23日晚上在德里市政厅举行市民欢迎会，欢迎参加亚洲作家会议的各国代表。
    德里市政委员会主席阿加瓦尔代表德里市民欢迎代表们说：“亚洲作家聚首一堂这种想法本身就是崇高的想法——是对复兴的亚洲充满希望的想法。它也许会使两年前在万隆诞生的亚非国家的团结和潘查希拉具有新的含义和重要性。”
    中国作家代表团团长茅盾在会上讲话的时候，感谢印度政府和德里市民的热情招待，并且转达了中国人民对印度人民的友好的感情。他说，中印友谊是世界和平的保证。我们的友谊是以潘查希拉为基础的。中国作家同印度作家一起，一定要以他们的全付力量来争取亚洲以及世界的繁荣和和平。
    缅甸、尼泊尔、日本、朝鲜、蒙古、越南的代表团团长和伊朗的纳菲西博士也在会上讲了话，他们一致感谢德里市民对他们的热烈欢迎。
