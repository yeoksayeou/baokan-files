Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th—Shandong Province's agricultural output and value growth rates this year have broken the province's historical records. This was pointed out by the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture recently when summarizing the implementation of the 1956 agricultural production plan.

From 1952 to 1955, Shandong Province's average annual growth rate of total grain output was 2.4%. This year, the province's total grain output can reach 30.4 billion jin, an increase of more than 3.4 billion jin over last year, with a growth rate of 12.8%, more than four times higher than the aforementioned average annual growth rate. This year, the province's total agricultural output value is expected to reach 5.82 billion yuan, an increase of 10.5% over last year. This growth rate is more than three and a half times higher than the average annual growth rate of 2.2% in the first three years of the Five-Year Plan.

This year, Shandong Province reduced the area of grain crops by more than 3 million mu due to the expansion of the planting area for cash crops. Therefore, this year, various localities mainly relied on efforts to increase the unit area yield to achieve the grain production increase plan. Over the past year, various localities have fully utilized the superior conditions after cooperativization and implemented a series of production increase measures, increasing the province's unit area yield of grain from 154 jin last year to 177 jin, an increase of 15% over last year. Among them, the northwestern Yellow River alluvial plain of Shandong, which has always been known as a low-yield grain area, has seen a greater increase in grain production this year. According to statistics from nineteen counties, the unit area yield has increased by 20% to 60% respectively compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th—According to statistics from the Shandong Provincial Grain Department as of December 20, Shandong Province has already purchased and stored more than 5 billion jin of grain this year, exceeding the annual grain purchase plan by 4%. The time for completion of storage was also nearly a month earlier than last year.

Now, the focus of the province's grain work has shifted to arranging unified sales. However, small amounts of grain continue to be listed on the markets in various localities, and coupled with the clearing of outstanding purchase amounts, the daily intake of grain is still nearly 4 million jin.

    山东今年粮食增产三十四亿斤
    新华社济南26日电　山东省今年的农业产量和产值的增长速度打破了本省的历史纪录。这是山东省农业厅最近在总结1956年农业生产计划执行情况的时候指出的。
    从1952年到1955年，山东省平均每年粮食总产量的增长速度是2.4％。今年全省粮食总产量可以达到三百零四亿斤，比去年增加三十四亿多斤，增长速度是12.8％，比上述平均每年增长速度提高了四倍多。今年全省农业的总产值预计可以达到五十八亿二千万元，比去年增长10.5％，这个增长速度比五年计划前三个年度平均每年增长2.2％的速度提高了三倍半以上。
    山东省今年由于扩大了经济作物的播种面积，粮食作物面积比去年减少三百多万亩。因此，今年各地主要是依靠努力提高单位面积产量，来实现粮食增产计划的。一年来各地充分运用了合作化以后的优越条件，推行了一系列的增产措施，使全省粮食的单位面积产量由去年的一百五十四斤提高到一百七十七斤，比去年增长了15％。其中一向被称为粮食低产地区的山东西北黄河冲积平原，今年粮食增产的幅度更大，据十九个县的统计，单位面积产量分别比去年提高了20％到60％。
    新华社济南26日电　据山东省粮食厅到12月20日的统计，山东省今年征购入库的粮食已经达到五十亿斤以上，超额4％完成了全年的粮食征购计划。完成入库的时间也比去年提前了将近一个月。
    现在，全省粮食工作的重点已经转向安排统销。可是各地市场陆续有小宗粮食上市，加上征购尾欠的清理，每天收进的粮食仍然有近四百万斤。
