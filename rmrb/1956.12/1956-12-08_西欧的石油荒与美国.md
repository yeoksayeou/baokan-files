　　The Western European Oil Shortage and the United States
　　Zhang Zhenya

    Since the Anglo-French-Israeli forced ceasefire in Egypt on November 7, the United States has taken advantage of the Suez Canal's closure and the severe panic over oil supplies in Britain and France, putting pressure on them in an attempt not only to create more favorable conditions for the US in the struggle for Middle Eastern oil interests, but also to strengthen its economic and political control over Britain, France, and other Western European countries.

    Faced with a serious crisis of factory closures and production shutdowns due to the oil shortage, Western European countries have been appealing to Washington for help since the beginning of last month, requesting access to oil supplies from the Western Hemisphere, but they have been met with a cold shoulder from the US government. Washington not only did not express immediate relief, but even temporarily shelved the plan drafted by the Middle East Emergency Committee, composed of fifteen US oil companies, to supply oil to Western Europe, which was formed in September when the "Users' Association" was established. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in his urgency, expressed his desire to meet with Eisenhower, but this request was also rejected. Subsequently, London's attempts to contact the White House through the foreign ministers of other countries (especially the foreign ministers of France and Australia) were also unsuccessful. In this situation, British Ambassador to the United States, Harold Caccia, had to make an appeal to all sectors of the United States at the National Press Club on November 15; later, diplomatic representatives from Italy, Greece, Austria, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and West Germany all went to the US State Department to make requests... However, until November 30, Washington remained indifferent to the urgent needs of its Western European allies.

    Is it difficult for the United States to export oil to Western Europe? No. According to an estimate in "US News & World Report" on November 16, the United States not only has the highest crude oil and gasoline reserves in history this year (approximately 280 million barrels), but also has a large number of untapped oil wells. By using these oil wells, it can produce an additional 2.2 million barrels of oil per day, which is more than enough to supply the one million barrels of oil that Western Europe lacks each day.

    In fact, the US government has long had plans to export oil to Western Europe. In order to take the opportunity to monopolize Western European oil supplies, the fifteen US oil companies organized the Middle East Emergency Committee in September when the "Users' Association" was established and formulated a detailed plan to supply oil to Western Europe. Eisenhower personally ordered the construction of fifty 60,000-ton large oil tankers to solve the transportation problem of exporting oil to Western Europe. A representative of a US oil company even advised Western Europe to not buy oil from the Middle East via the Cape of Good Hope (a distance of 11,300 miles) due to the shortage of ships, but only to buy oil from the United States (a distance of 5,000 miles).

    If that is the case, why is the US government now using oil supplies to coerce Britain and France?

    The US bourgeois press has repeatedly propagandized that the reason the US is doing this is to force Britain and France to withdraw their troops from Egypt as soon as possible. This is of course a deceptive lie, and behind this propaganda actually lies many of the US's ulterior motives.

    It is well known that the United States does not fully agree with the Anglo-French military adventure in the Middle East. According to the British magazine "The Economist" on November 17, this is because the actions of Britain and France have "involved the direct interests of the United States." The magazine wrote: "...In the first half of this year, US companies controlled almost 60% of the oil produced in the Middle East. The good management of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline, the continued production of Saudi Arabian (oil)... In other Middle Eastern countries, the Arabs' preferential treatment of US oil companies... This is the reason why the United States refuses to support the Anglo-French intervention in the Middle East."

    These words from "The Economist" perfectly reveal the sharp contradiction of American and British oil interests behind the differences in Middle East policy between the United States, Britain, and France.

    US oil monopoly capital is not only constantly expanding its power in Middle Eastern oil production, causing British oil interests in the Middle East to suffer increasingly serious threats, but also formulating a long-term and huge investment plan to squeeze Britain and other countries out of Middle Eastern oil interests, so that they can completely monopolize it. An expert from the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) revealed in March of this year that by 1975, US monopoly capital would invest $106 billion in oil equipment outside the United States, of which $60 billion to $65 billion would be invested in the Middle East. For this reason, he demanded a "sound atmosphere" in the Persian Gulf region. Not only that, as the "New York Times" said, the United States also has an "ambitious oil tanker construction plan" to seize Britain's leading position in world oil transportation (owning 20% of the world's total oil tanker tonnage). According to a report in the US "Time" magazine on November 26, the United States is currently stepping up the manufacture of oil tankers. In various shipyards, new order forms are overwhelming. The US Sun Shipbuilding Company has accepted orders to build two 30,000-ton oil tankers and is signing contracts for the construction of several 45,000-ton oil tankers and several 60,000-ton super oil tankers. Because 170,000 tons of steel are needed to cope with current shipbuilding orders, and in the event of a shortage of steel plates, the US government is prepared to give priority to shipyards in terms of steel plate supply. All of this cannot but be a very critical signal to Britain's already difficult to protect oil interests in the Middle East.

    It is precisely because of this that the purpose of the Anglo-French military adventure against Egypt was not only to reoccupy the Suez Canal and suppress the national independence movement in the Middle East, but also to compete with the United States for interests in the Middle East and to be unwilling to let Middle Eastern oil interests fall completely into the hands of the United States.

    The failure of the Anglo-French military adventure in the Middle East made the United States believe that this was a great opportunity for it to further penetrate the Middle East. Therefore, the United States is currently formulating a large-scale investment plan for Middle Eastern countries (including Israel), including: providing relief to Egypt, helping Egypt revive its economy (even helping it rebuild the Aswan Dam), reconsidering the implementation of Johnston's plan to assist Arab and Israeli joint development of the Jordan River, etc., in order to make the Middle East a regional group completely controlled by the United States, and further squeeze out Britain and France. An editorial in the New York Times on November 13 bluntly pointed out: "The vacuum that has appeared due to the collapse of British and French power in the Middle East should be filled by... the United States."

    Of course, the United States, harboring the ambition to dominate the world, is not only satisfied with squeezing out the interests of Britain and France in the Middle East. The "New York Times" on November 27 unequivocally pointed out that the United States is already using the decline of French power in North Africa to exert pressure on Tunisia and Morocco in order to bring these countries into Washington's sphere of influence.

    In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals and make Britain and France obedient, this is the real reason why the United States deliberately coerced Britain and France on the issue of oil supply.

    Now, the Washington authorities, seeing that Britain and France have no choice but to withdraw their troops from the Suez Canal area, and in order to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to monopolize Western European oil supplies and control world oil resources, announced on November 30 that it had authorized fifteen oil companies to export oil to Western Europe.

    However, the US decision to export oil to Western Europe does not mean the end of Western Europe's disaster, but rather the beginning of their disaster. Because buying American oil not only means paying high oil prices (the unit price of oil in various ports in the US Gulf of Mexico is $3.25 per barrel, while the unit price of oil in various ports in the Persian Gulf is only $1.97 per barrel), sharply rising freight rates (up 38%), but also having to pay a large sum of US dollars for this. This is another fatal difficulty for Britain and France, which lack US dollars.

    British Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan lamented on December 4 that Britain's gold and dollar reserves had been reduced to 1.965 billion US dollars (which is far below the minimum limit of 2 billion US dollars necessary to protect the value of the pound). In this case, Britain asked the United States and Canada to waive the interest on post-war loans to Britain, which should have been paid by Britain on December 1, otherwise the exchange rate of the pound would be unsustainable.

    The United States has indicated that it is willing to consider Britain's request for exemption from interest. Moreover, the United States is also willing to provide financial "aid" to Britain. People remember that in September, when the "Users' Association" was established, Dulles stated that the United States was willing to loan 500 million US dollars to Western European countries through the Import-Export Bank to purchase oil in the Western Hemisphere. However, Britain will not fail to see that this is nothing more than a great opportunity to tighten the noose around Britain once again.

    No wonder the French "Les Echos" said: "Our economic independence is under threat. Military intervention in Egypt has frustrated our economic independence. In the future, we will be tightly dependent on the United States, as in the post-war period, and it will use oil and dollars to control us." It seems that things are very clear. If Britain and France continue to implement the policy of suppressing national independence and following the United States in expanding armaments and preparing for war, they will not only be unable to get rid of the difficulties they face, but will also inevitably be more deeply controlled by the United States economically and politically.

　　西欧的石油荒与美国
　　张振亚
    自从11月7日英、法、以在埃及被迫停火以来，美国就利用苏伊士运河中断、英、法的石油供应发生严重恐慌的窘境，向它们施加压力，企图不仅为美国在争夺中东石油利益的斗争中创造更有利的条件，而且还要借此来加强对英、法和其他西欧国家经济和政治上的控制。
    由于石油荒而面对着工厂关门、生产停顿的严重危机的西欧国家，实际上从上月初开始，就纷纷向华盛顿告急，要求取得西半球的石油供应，但是却遭到了美国政府的冷淡对待。华盛顿不但没有表示立即予以救济，甚至把9月间成立“使用国协会”时由美国十五家石油公司组成的供应西欧石油的中东紧急委员会所拟就的计划还暂时搁置了一下。情急的英国外交大臣劳埃德曾表示想同艾森豪威尔会晤，但这个请求也被拒绝了。其后，伦敦方面通过其他国家的外交部长（特别是通过法国和澳大利亚的外交部长）同白宫进行接触的做法，也没有成功。在这种情况下，英国驻美大使哈罗德·卡西亚不得不于11月15日在美国全国新闻俱乐部向美国各界发出求救的呼吁；以后，意大利、希腊、奥地利、挪威、西班牙、瑞士和西德的外交代表都曾纷纷前往美国国务院提出请求……但是在11月30日以前，华盛顿对它的西欧盟友的燃眉之急，一直是束手不理。
    是否美国向西欧输出石油有困难呢？不是的。据11月16日“美国新闻与世界报道”的估计，美国今年不仅拥有历史上最高纪录的原油和汽油的储备量（约二亿八千万桶），而且还有大量未动用的油井。利用这些油井，每天就可以多生产二百二十万桶石油，这对于供应西欧每天所缺的一百多万桶石油是绰绰有余的。
    实际上，美国政府对于向西欧输出石油是早已有打算的。为了趁机垄断西欧的石油供应，在今年9月“使用国协会”成立时，美国的十五家石油公司就组织了中东紧急委员会，拟订了供应西欧石油的详尽计划。艾森豪威尔还亲自下令建造六万吨的五十艘大油船，以解决向西欧输出石油的运输问题。美国一家石油公司的代表还以船舶少为理由，劝诱西欧最好不从中东绕道好望角买石油（这样航距为一万一千三百英里），而只向美国买石油（航距为五千英里）。
    既然这样，那么美国政府现在又为什么要在石油供应上挟制英、法呢？
    美国资产阶级报刊连篇累牍地宣传说，美国所以要这样做，乃是为了迫使英、法早日从埃及撤兵。这当然是骗人的鬼话，在这种宣传后面实际上隐藏着美国的许多不可告人的目的。
    人所共知，美国并不完全同意英法在中东的军事冒险的，这原因，按照11月17日的英国“经济学家”杂志的说法，是因为英、法的行动已“涉及美国的直接利益”。这家杂志写道：“……今年上半年美国公司就差不多控制了60％的中东生产的石油。大阿拉伯油管的良好管理，沙特阿拉伯（石油）生产的继续进行……在其他中东国家中，阿拉伯人对美国石油公司的优待……这就是美国拒绝支持英、法对中东的干预的原因。”
      “经济学家”杂志的这些话，正好揭示了在美、英、法三国中东政策的分歧后面的尖锐的美英石油利益的矛盾。
    美国石油垄断资本不但在中东的石油生产中不断地扩张着自己的力量，使英国在中东的石油利益遭受着日益严重的威胁，而且还拟订了一个长期的、庞大的投资计划，以便把英国和其他国家排挤出中东的石油利益之外，由它们来完全垄断。美阿石油公司的一个专家在今年3月间就曾透露说，在1975年以前，美国垄断资本将在美国国外的石油设备中投入一千零六十亿美元的资金，其中有六百至六百五十亿美元将投入中东。为此，他要求在波斯湾地区要有“健全的气氛”。不止如此，正如美国“纽约时报，所说的，美国还有一个“雄心勃勃的油船建造计划”，来夺取英国在世界石油运输中的领导地位（拥有世界油船总吨位的20％）根据11月26日美国“时代周刊”的报道，目前美国已在加紧制造油船。在各个造船厂中，新的订货单已有应接不暇之势。美国的太阳造船公司已经接受了承制两艘三万吨油船的订单，并正在签订关于承制几艘四万五千吨的油船和几艘六万吨的超级油船的合同。由于应付目前造船订货需要十七万吨钢。在钢板缺货的情况下，美国政府已准备在钢板供应方面给各造船厂以优先权。这一切对于已经难以自保的英国在中东的石油利益，不能不是一个十分危急的信号。
    正是因为这样，英、法对埃及发动军事冒险的目的，固然是为了重占苏伊士运河、镇压中东的民族独立运动，但同时也是为了同美国争夺中东的利益，不甘心让中东的石油利益完全落入美国手中。
    英法在中东的军事冒险的失败，使美国认为这是它进一步渗入中东的大好机会。因而目前美国已在拟订一项规模宏大的对中东国家（包括以色列）的投资计划，其中包括：对埃及进行救济，帮助埃及复兴经济（甚至帮助它重建阿斯旺水坝），重新考虑实施约翰·斯顿的资助阿拉伯、以色列共同开发约旦河计划等等，以便使中东成为一个完全由美国控制的区域性集团，进一步把英、法排挤出去。11月13日纽约时报的社论就露骨地指出：“由于英、法在中东势力的崩溃而出现的空白，应当由……美国来填补。”
    当然，怀着独霸世界的野心的美国并不仅仅满足于在中东排挤英、法的利益。11月27日的“纽约时报”就毫不含糊地指出，美国已经在利用法国在北非势力的衰落，向突尼斯和摩洛哥施展手段，以便使这些国家进入华盛顿的影响范围。
    为了实现上述的这些目的，并使英、法乖乖地就范，这就是美国在石油供应问题上故意挟制英、法的真实原因。
    现在，华盛顿当局在看到英法已经不能不从苏伊士运河区撤退它们的军队的情况下，并且为了抓住这个垄断西欧石油供应、控制世界石油资源的千载一时的机会，已于11月30日宣布授权十五家石油公司向西欧输出石油。
    但是，美国向西欧输出石油的决定，并不意味着西欧灾难的终止，倒勿宁说是它们的灾难的开始。因为买美国的石油除了意味着须支付高昂的石油价格（美国墨西哥湾各港口的每桶石油单价是三点二五美元，而波斯湾各港口的石油单价只有一点九七美元），急剧上升的运费（上涨了38％）以外，还须要为此付出大笔的美元。这对于缺乏美元的英、法说来，不啻又是一个致命的难关。
    12月4日英国财政大臣麦克米伦已发出哀鸣说：英国的黄金美元储备已减少到十九亿六千五百万美元（已大大低于保障英镑价值所必要的最低限额二十亿美元）在这种情况下，英国要求美国和加拿大放弃应该在12月1日由英国交纳的战后给英国贷款的利息，否则英镑的牌价就将无法维持。
    美国已表示愿考虑英国关于免除利息的要求。而且，美国还愿意在财政上“援助”英国呢。人们记得，在9月间“使用国协会”成立时，杜勒斯就曾表示，愿由美国通过进口银行贷款五亿美元给西欧国家来购买西半球的石油。但是，英国不会看不到，这无异是给英国又一次勒紧绳索的大好机会。
    难怪法国的“回声报”要说：“我们的经济独立处在威胁中。对埃及的军事干涉使我们的经济独立受到了挫折。今后我们将像战后时期一样紧紧地依赖美国，它将用石油和美元来控制我们。”看来事情是十分明显了，英、法如果继续执行镇压民族独立和追随美国扩军备战的政策，它们将不仅无法摆脱它们所面临的困难，而且也难免在经济和政治上更深地为美国所控制。
