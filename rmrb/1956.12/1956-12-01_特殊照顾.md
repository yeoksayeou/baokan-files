    “Special Treatment”
    Shou Chen
    After the People's Daily published an article on October 6th entitled "This Trend Cannot Continue," criticizing certain organs for unreasonable "special treatment" for leading cadres, some people said, "Egalitarianism is raising its head!" "The egalitarianism of riding horses and eating at special canteens during the supply system era has now transformed into lifestyle issues!"
    Is this really the case?
    If it were the past supply system era, ideas like "This Trend Cannot Continue" might be egalitarianism, similar to the privileges of riding horses and eating at special canteens. Because it was incompatible with the supply system principles of that time. But we are not currently living under a supply system. After the entire country's cadres transitioned from the supply system to a wage system, people's labor compensation is now expressed through wages, the basic form: more and complex labor receives higher wages; less and simpler labor receives lower wages. The wages of leading cadres are already higher than those of general cadres and the masses. So, there shouldn't be excessive special treatment on top of that.
    After implementing the wage system, should all the necessary and appropriate care for leading cadres be completely abolished? I think not. Providing cars and better living conditions specifically to take care of the busy work of leading cadres is beneficial to the work. The majority of the masses have no objection to this.
    However, there should be a limit to such care. If it is boundless, extending to preferential treatment for leading cadres in purchasing items like watches, nylon stockings, and sweaters, then there is nothing that cannot be included in the list of "care." The more unreasonable care there is, the more dissatisfied the masses become, and the more the leaders are alienated from the masses.
    Judging from many current indications, "This Trend" really "Cannot Continue." As far as I know, the so-called "special treatment" trend in some organs and units has reached an alarming level. For example, a certain organ in Heilongjiang Province stipulated last year that the heating expenses of cadres at or above the deputy ministerial level, regardless of how much they exceeded the standard, would be reimbursed by the public; while general cadres had to bear the full cost themselves. Another example is that a certain organ's motor pool was constantly complaining about "insufficient gasoline" for a period of time, imposing many strict regulations on the use of cars by general cadres, while a certain deputy minister's wife could take a car out to dance halls every Saturday night... All of this is outrageous.
    Care based on work needs is reasonable care; otherwise, it is unreasonable. The current trend of special treatment has greatly exceeded the scope of work, and therefore can only foster the privileged thinking of some people, which is of no benefit. So, let us discard this bad thing as we would throw away garbage!

    “特殊照顾”
    手辰
    人民日报10月6日第三版发表了“此风不可长”一文后，批评某些机关对领导干部的不合理的“特殊照顾”，就听到有人说：“平均主义思想抬头了！”“供给制时代在骑马、吃小灶上的平均主义，现在又转化到生活问题上来了！”
    难道事实真是这样吗？
    如果是在过去供给制时代，跟闹骑马、吃小灶等待遇一样，“此风不可长”之类的思想也许是平均主义思想。因为它是同当时供给制原则不相容的。但我们目前并非过的供给制生活。全国干部由供给制改为工资制后，人们的劳动报酬已用工资这个基本形式表示出来，劳动多而复杂的，工资高；劳动少而简单的，工资低。领导干部的工资已比一般干部和群众高。那么另外就不该有过多的特殊待遇了。
    在实行工资制后，是否要一律取消对领导干部某些应该和必要的照顾呢？我以为不然。为照顾领导干部的工作繁忙而专门供给汽车、较好的居住条件等等，是对工作有利的。大多数群众对此也并无意见。
    但是，照顾也应该有个范围，如果漫无边际，像手表、尼龙袜子、毛衣之类商品的购买上，也要优先照顾领导干部，那么就没有什么东西不可以列在“照顾”之列了。这种不合理的照顾愈多，群众愈不满，愈使领导脱离群众。
    从目前许多迹象来看，“此风”也确实是“不可长”了。据我所知，在某些机关单位里所谓特殊照顾之“风”，简直达到惊人的地步。比如黑龙江省某机关去年曾规定：副部长以上干部的暖气费，不管超过标准多少，一律由公家报销；而一般干部呢，则完全由自己负担。又比如某机关有一个时期汽车库天天叫喊“汽油不足”，对一般干部使用汽车作了许多严格规定，而某副部长的爱人却可在礼拜六晚上乘上汽车到处溜舞场……。凡此种种，都是不像话的。
    从工作出发的照顾是合理的照顾，反之就是不合理的。目前这种特殊照顾之风，却已大大地超过工作的范围，因而只能助长某些人的特权思想，没有什么好处。那么，让我们像丢掉垃圾一样地赶快丢掉这种坏东西吧！
