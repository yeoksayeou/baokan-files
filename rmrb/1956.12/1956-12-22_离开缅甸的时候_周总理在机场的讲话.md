    Leaving Burma
    Premier Zhou's Speech at the Airport
    Your Excellency Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Friends,

    My companions and I are about to leave your beautiful country today after a ten-day friendly visit.
    In the past ten days, we have visited Yangon, Mandalay, Maymyo, Bhamo, Myitkyina County, Shwe-o, Taunggyi, and Lashio. We have had close talks with the leaders of the Union of Burma. We have met elders, brothers, sisters, and children of all your nationalities. We have also met people from your political, economic, military, educational, cultural, artistic, religious, and other circles, as well as young students. We have enjoyed your beautiful scenery and your beautiful ethnic music and dances. In addition, we have seen the national flags of China and Burma flying together everywhere, and we have heard people warmly cheering "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship" everywhere. The past ten days have been unforgettable for us.
    Through this visit, we have gained a deeper understanding of your beautiful and richly cultured and heroic and enthusiastic people of your rich country. You have great prospects for development. We wish you continued success in building your motherland.
    Through this visit, we have more deeply felt the profound friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people. You call us "Pauk-Phaw". This is an expression of the great friendship of the Burmese people towards the Chinese people. For this, I express my gratitude to you on behalf of the Chinese people. The people of our two countries are not only relatives, but also brothers. We must strive to maintain the close friendship between our two peoples for generations to come. Moreover, we must make this friendship even closer and more developed.
    Through this visit, Vice Premier He Long and I have established closer relations with the leaders of Burma. During our visit, I held several talks with His Excellency Prime Minister U Ba Swe, and we also issued a joint statement reaffirming the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We are deeply convinced that on the basis of these principles, we can resolve various historical issues between our two countries. In addition, we must promote friendly cooperation between our two countries in all aspects to a higher stage. The friendship between our two countries based on the Five Principles has unlimited prospects for development.
    Dear Excellency Prime Minister U Ba Swe, dear friends, at the time of parting, I once again sincerely thank you for your friendly invitation, which gave us the opportunity to make a longer visit to our close neighbors. We sincerely express our gratitude to Your Excellency, the Burmese government, and the people of all ethnic groups in Burma for receiving us like relatives. We hope that we will soon have the opportunity to welcome Your Excellency, the Prime Minister, Your Excellency's wife, and other leaders of the Burmese government to Beijing to reciprocate the warm reception and enthusiastic welcome given to us by the Burmese government and people this time.
    I wish the Union of Burma prosperity and the Burmese people happiness.
    May the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people grow day by day.
    Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!
    Long live world peace!

    离开缅甸的时候
    周总理在机场的讲话吴巴瑞总理阁下，朋友们，
    我的同伴们和我在你们美丽的国家进行了十天的友好访问以后今天要同你们分别了。
    在过去十天中，我们访问了仰光、曼德勒、眉谬、八莫、密支那县、喜河、东枝以及腊戍等地。我们同缅甸联邦的领袖们进行了亲密的会谈。我们见到了你们各民族的长者、兄弟姊妹和孩子们。我们还见到了你们的政治、经济、军事、教育、文化、艺术、宗教和其他各界的人士以及青年学生。我们欣赏了你们美丽的风景以及优美的民族音乐和舞蹈。此外，我们到处看到中缅两国的国旗一起飘扬，我们到处听到人们热烈欢呼“中缅友好万岁”的声音。过去的十天对我们说来是难忘的十天。
    通过这次访问，我们对你们富饶的国家的优美的、丰富多采的文化和英勇而热情的人民有了更多的了解。你们有很大的发展前途。我们祝你们在建设你们的祖国中继续不断地取得成就。
    通过这次访问，我们更深刻地体会到中缅两国人民的深厚友谊。你们叫我们做“胞波”。这是缅甸人民对中国人民的伟大友谊的一种表现。对于这一点，我代表中国人民向你们表示感谢。我们两国的人民不仅是亲戚，而且是兄弟。我们一定要努力在今后的世世代代中保持我们两国人民之间的密切友谊。而且，我们一定还要使这种友谊更加密切，更加发展。
    通过这次访问，我本人和贺龙副总理已经同缅甸的领袖们建立了更加密切的关系。在我们访问期间，我同吴巴瑞总理阁下举行了好几次会谈，我们还发表了一篇联合声明，重申和平共处的五项原则。我们深信，根据这些原则，我们可以解决我们两国之间历史上遗留下来的各种问题。此外，我们还要在各个方面促进我们两国之间的友好合作，使它达到更高的阶段。以五项原则为基础的我们两国之间的友谊是有无限的发展前途的。
    亲爱的吴巴瑞总理阁下，亲爱的朋友们，在离别的时候，我再次衷心地感谢你们给予我的友好邀请，这次邀请使我们有机会在我们的近邻进行一次时间比较长的访问。我们诚恳地向阁下，缅甸政府以及缅甸各族人民表示谢意，感谢你们像接待亲人一样地接待我们。我们希望，我们将很快有机会在北京欢迎总理阁下，欢迎阁下的夫人，以及欢迎缅甸政府的其他领袖，以便酬答缅甸政府和人民这次给予我们的热情的招待和热烈的欢迎。
    我祝缅甸联邦繁荣，缅甸人民幸福。
    愿中国和缅甸人民之间的兄弟般的友谊日益发展。
    中缅友好万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
