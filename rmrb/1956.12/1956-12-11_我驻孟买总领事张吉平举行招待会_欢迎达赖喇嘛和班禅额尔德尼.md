Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, 10th December: Zhang Jiping, the Chinese Consul General in Bombay, held a reception on the evening of December 9th to welcome the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini's visit to Bombay.

As the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini arrived, Zhang Jiping presented them with hadas, and representatives of the overseas Chinese presented them with flowers.

Approximately three hundred guests gathered on the lawn of the Chinese Consulate and were introduced to the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini conversed with the guests and, at the request of many male and female guests present, signed autographs for them as mementos. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini spent a pleasant evening with Indian friends at the Chinese Consulate.

Among those present were the Governor of Bombay State, Chagla, the Speaker of the Bombay Legislative Assembly, Sriram, the Acting Chief Minister of Bombay, Mehta, the Mayor of Bombay, Kader, prominent figures from all walks of life, as well as consuls from various countries stationed in Bombay and representatives of the overseas Chinese community.

Earlier, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini had taken a motorboat tour of Bombay Harbor and visited the famous grottoes on an island six miles off the coast of Bombay. These grottoes are entirely carved out of solid rock. The guests saw many statues belonging to the 8th century AD. They greatly admired these statues. They also visited the Victoria Zoo and the Anand Vihar Temple, where they presented hadas to the statue of Shakyamuni Buddha.

The Bombay newspapers all published the news of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini's arrival in Bombay on their front pages. From the station onwards, there were thousands of people along the route cheering them, and many others stood on rooftops and balconies to applaud and welcome them.
