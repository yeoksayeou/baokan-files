Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 6th. Chairman of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, Fierlinger, hosted a banquet on the evening of December 4th to welcome the delegation of the Chinese National People's Congress and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee.

　　Fierlinger delivered a speech at the banquet. After praising the achievements of China's rapidly developing industrial and agricultural construction, he said: Common ideals and common economic and cultural interests bind us together. At the same time, the sincere and fraternal relations with our common great ally, the Soviet Union, also bind our two countries together. We are learning from the Soviet Union and absorbing its great experience. However, the great experience of the Chinese people and the wisdom of their politicians are also a rich source for us to learn from.

　　He said: The Czechoslovak people are watching with great interest and deep emotion the increasing prestige of People's China in the world, especially its growing influence on Asian countries that are shaking off the final shackles of colonialism and hoping for a new life. The great liberation movement of Asian countries is an irresistible force driving the entire world forward.

　　Head of the delegation, Peng Zhen, then delivered a speech. He first congratulated Czechoslovakia on its achievements in economic and cultural construction. He said: The Chinese people and the Czechoslovak people have a deep and unbreakable friendship. Our close cooperation, mutual support, and mutual assistance in politics, economics, culture, and other fields are an important guarantee for making our cause move from victory to victory. Unity is strength. We believe that the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is an important guarantee for world lasting peace and an important guarantee for our common cause and the progressive cause of all mankind. This unity is not only necessary and possible, but will inevitably be increasingly consolidated and developed with our joint efforts and with the improvement of the consciousness of the working class and all working people of all countries. Because the relations between our socialist countries are based on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial inviolability, respect for national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and are based on the principles of mutual benefit and assistance, jointly promoting the economic upsurge of all countries, and jointly opposing imperialist aggression. We not only have fundamentally consistent interests that are closely related as a material foundation, but also have the common belief of Marxism-Leninism as an ideological foundation and as a guide for action. This unity should be eternal and unbreakable. The interests of imperialism are completely opposed to our interests. In order to maintain their dying fate, imperialists always try their best to use the tactics of defeating each one and seizing the fortress from the inside to undermine the unity between socialist countries and the unity within socialist countries. Therefore, we must be vigilant. All our socialist countries and progressive mankind all over the world should maintain and cherish this unity. The proletarians of the world should unite, the working people of the world should unite, and all socialist countries and all peace-loving countries and people in the world should unite to jointly safeguard world peace and promote the progressive cause of mankind.

　　Personnel from the Presidium of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, Deputy Prime Minister Kopecký, and Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Cao Ying also attended the banquet.

　　捷国民议会主席宴我人民代表大会代表团
　　费林格和彭真谈社会主义国家的共同思想和利益
    新华社布拉格6日电　捷克斯洛伐克国民议会主席费林格4日晚间设宴招待中国全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团。
    费林格在宴会上发表了谈话。他在赞扬了中国正在迅速地进行的工农业建设的成就后说：共同的思想和经济上、文化上的共同利益把我们结合在一起。同时，跟我们共同的伟大友邦苏联之间的诚挚的兄弟般关系也把我们两国互相结合起来。我们正在向苏联学习和吸取它的伟大经验。但是，中国人民的伟大经验和他们政治家的智慧也是我们学习的丰富泉源。
    他说：捷克斯洛伐克人民正在以巨大的兴趣和深刻的感情注视着人民中国在世界上的威望日益增长，特别是它对正在摆脱殖民主义的最后枷锁而希望过新生活的亚洲国家的影响日益增长。亚洲国家的伟大的解放运动是不可抗拒地推动整个世界向前发展的巨大力量。
    代表团团长彭真接着致词。他首先对捷克斯洛伐克经济和文化建设的成就表示祝贺。他说：中国人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民之间是有着深厚的牢不可破的友谊的。我们在政治、经济、文化等各方面的密切合作、互相支持、互相帮助是使我们的事业从胜利走向胜利的重要保证。团结就是力量，我们认为以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间的团结是世界持久和平的重要保障，是我们的共同事业和整个人类进步事业的重要保障。这种团结不但是应该的和可能的，而且必将随着我们的共同努力，随着各国工人阶级和全体劳动人民觉悟的提高而日益巩固和发展。因为我们社会主义各国之间的关系是建立在完全平等、尊重领土的不可侵犯性、尊重国家的独立和主权以及互不干涉内政的原则基础之上的，是以互利互助、共同促进各国经济的高涨、共同反对帝国主义侵略的原则为基础的。我们不但有着休戚相关的根本的利害一致作为物质基础；而且有着马克思列宁主义的共同信仰作为思想基础，作为行动指针。这种团结应该是永恒的和牢不可破的。帝国主义的利害和我们的利害是完全相反的。帝国主义者为了维护他们苟延残喘的命运，总是千方百计地企图用各个击破、从内部夺取堡垒的技俩来破坏社会主义国家之间的团结和社会主义国家内部的团结。因此我们必须提高警惕，我们所有的社会主义国家和全世界进步人类应该维护和珍视这种团结，全世界无产阶级应该团结起来，全世界劳动人民应该团结起来，全世界社会主义各国和一切爱好和平的国家和人民应该团结起来，共同维护世界的和平，促进人类的进步事业。
    捷克斯洛伐克国民议会主席团人员、副总理柯别茨基和中国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使曹瑛等也参加了这个宴会。
