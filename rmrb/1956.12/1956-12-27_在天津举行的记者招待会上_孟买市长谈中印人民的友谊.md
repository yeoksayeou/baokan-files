Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th December: "Hindi-Chini bhai bhai (Indians and Chinese are brothers)," this is by no means a slogan, but a reality. The friendship between the people of China and India will definitely develop to an unbreakable extent. The Mayor of Bombay, India, Mr. Kaḍar, who was invited by Tianjin Mayor Huang Huoqing to visit Tianjin, said with such enthusiastic words to reporters after arriving here today, introducing his feelings about the friendship between the people of China and India.
    Mr. Kaḍar held a press conference in a quiet villa in Tianjin. He made a statement to reporters, saying: From the moment I entered your country's borders to here, I have been given warm care and enthusiastic welcome. Our two countries have many things in common. After I entered China, my understanding of this commonality has become even deeper. I think that this mutual friendly visit can better promote mutual understanding and jointly overcome difficulties.
    When talking about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to India, Mayor Kaḍar said: Your Premier Zhou left an indelible impression on the Indian people. His visit to India further developed the friendship between the two peoples. This friendship is based on "Panchsheel" (Five Principles). Our friendship will definitely develop to an unbreakable extent.
    When a reporter talked to him about Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis, the famous doctor from Bombay who sacrificed himself in China during the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Kaḍar said: In India, whenever we recall him, we think of great China and the friendship between our two countries.

    在天津举行的记者招待会上
    孟买市长谈中印人民的友谊
    新华社天津26日电　“印地秦尼巴依巴依（印中人民是兄弟）”，这绝不是一句口号，而是现实。印中两国人民的友谊一定会发展到牢不可破的程度。应天津市市长黄火青邀请到天津来访问的印度孟买市长卡德尔在今天到达这里之后，用这样热情的话向记者们介绍他对中印两国人民友好的感想。
    卡德尔在天津一座幽静的别墅里举行了记者招待会。他向记者发表谈话说：我从进入贵国国境到这里，一直受到亲切的照顾和热忱的欢迎。我们两国有许多共同之处，当我进入中国国境之后，我对这种共同之处的了解就更加深刻。我认为这种互相友好访问是可以更好地促进彼此了解和共同克服困难。
    在谈到周恩来总理访问印度时，卡德尔市长说：你们的周总理给印度人民留下不可磨灭的印象，他这次访问印度，又进一步发展了两国人民的友谊。这种友谊是建立在“潘查希拉”（五项原则）的基础上的，我们之间的友谊一定会发展到牢不可破的程度。
    有记者和他谈起抗日战争时期牺牲在中国的孟买著名的医生柯棣华大夫，卡德尔说：在印度每当我们回忆起他的时候，我们就想到伟大的中国和我们两国之间的友谊。
    卡德尔市长还对天津青年报记者表示：他愿意为天津和孟买两城市的青年友谊活动而尽力。
