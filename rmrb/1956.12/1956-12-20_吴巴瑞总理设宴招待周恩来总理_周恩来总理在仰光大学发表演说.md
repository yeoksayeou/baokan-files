Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 19th: Burmese Prime Minister Wu Ba Swe said on the evening of December 18th that Premier Zhou Enlai's friendly visit to Burma "has added another pillar to the edifice of Sino-Burmese friendship." He said that this edifice was built according to the Five Principles, and that Premier Zhou Enlai was one of the main architects of these principles.

Prime Minister Wu Ba Swe said at the banquet he and his wife held for the Chinese guests that the entire country of Burma highly respected the Chinese Premier. "Your natural and affable demeanor and frank friendliness have won you and China countless new friends."

He said that he had just returned from a visit to China. He was very moved by the sincere and warm welcome he received during his short stay in Mangshi, China. He said: "We never felt like we were traveling in a foreign country. It was like visiting close relatives. No wonder our Chinese friends are called 'Pauk Phaw' (compatriots) in Burma."

Premier Zhou Enlai summarized his impressions of his visit to Burma in his speech with the following words: "Burmese and Chinese people are relatives, 'Pauk Phaw'. Therefore, their relationship must never be undermined by any external forces, on the contrary, it must continue to develop from generation to generation."

Premier Zhou Enlai, in quoting Prime Minister Wu Ba Swe's statement two days ago at the joint gathering of the peoples on both sides of the border in Mangshi, said that the peoples of the two countries should jointly prevent external conspiracies and sabotage with the attitude of friendly neighbors and the spirit of mutual trust, guaranteeing that "on the Chinese side, we will certainly abide by the principle that all countries, big and small, are equal, resolutely oppose great-power chauvinism, and, together with our Burmese brothers and sisters, crush any attempt to undermine our close and friendly relations."

Premier Zhou Enlai said that his visit to Burma was an unforgettable and happy time spent with Burmese brothers and sisters. In response to Prime Minister Wu Ba Swe's invitation for the Chinese Premier to frequently visit Burmese relatives, Premier Zhou Enlai invited the Burmese Prime Minister and his wife and other Burmese leaders to visit their Chinese relatives in China.

The banquet was held on the lawn outside the Kandawgyi Hotel, one of the best hotels in Rangoon. The hotel was brightly lit, and the lawn was illuminated by thousands of lanterns and colored electric lights hanging from trees and poles.

More than 300 people attended the banquet, including Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister and Shan State Head of State Sao Hkun Hkio, Kachin State Head of State U Zan Hta Sin, Daw Khin Kyi, Burmese ministers, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Burma.

After the banquet, students from the National Normal Colleges in Rangoon, Mandalay, and other cities performed singing and dancing programs for the guests. The hosts also presented the Chinese guests with various gifts, including ivory carvings, silver gongs hanging on ivory, Burmese lacquerware, and gold ornaments inlaid with rubies.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 19th: Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech at the University of Rangoon, the highest institution of learning in Burma, on December 18th at the invitation of the university (the full text of the speech is on the second page).

Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at the University of Rangoon at 3:00 p.m. accompanied by Prime Minister Wu Ba Swe and Deputy Premier He Long. Female students presented him with flowers, and 1,500 students stood up and applauded to welcome him.

U Bo Gyi, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Rangoon, said in his welcoming speech that the University of Rangoon was honored by Premier Zhou Enlai's visit.

Premier Zhou Enlai's speech was interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the audience more than twenty times.

When Premier Zhou Enlai left the auditorium after delivering his speech, many students stood on their chairs and applauded him off.

    吴巴瑞总理设宴招待周恩来总理
    周恩来总理在仰光大学发表演说
    新华社仰光19日电　缅甸总理吴巴瑞12月18日晚上说，周恩来总理对缅甸的友好访问“为中缅友谊大厦增添了另一根支柱”。他说，这个大厦是按照五项原则建造的，而周恩来总理是这些原则的主要建筑师之一。
    吴巴瑞总理在他和他的夫人为中国客人们举行的宴会上说，缅甸全国各地都非常尊敬中国总理。“你的自然而令人可亲的风度和坦率的友好态度使你和中国获得了无数新的朋友。”
    他说，他刚刚从中国访问回来。他在中国芒市的短期停留期间所受到的真诚热烈的欢迎使他很感动。他说：“我们一直没有感觉到我们是在外国旅行。就像是在近亲的家里访问一样。难怪我们的中国朋友在缅甸被称为‘胞波’（同胞）。”
    周恩来总理在讲话中用下面的话总结了他访问缅甸的印象：“缅甸人和中国人是亲戚，是‘胞波’。因此，他们的关系决不能受到任何外力的破坏，相反地，而是要继续一代一代地发展下去。”
    周恩来总理在援引吴巴瑞总理两天前在芒市两国边境人民联欢大会上所说的两国人民应该以友好邻邦的态度和相互信任的精神来共同防止外界的阴谋破坏的活动，保证“在中国方面，我们一定遵守大小国家一律平等的原则，坚决反对大国沙文主义，而且，同缅甸兄弟姊妹一起，粉碎任何破坏我们的密切友好关系的企图。”
    周恩来总理说，他在缅甸的访问是和缅甸兄弟姊妹们一起度过的令人难忘的幸福的日子。为了酬答吴巴瑞总理邀请中国总理经常访问缅甸亲戚，周恩来总理邀请缅甸总理和他的夫人以及其他缅甸领袖到中国访问他们的中国亲戚。
    宴会是在仰光最好的旅馆之一坎包扎旅馆外面的草地上举行的。旅馆里灯光辉煌，草地上也被挂在树上和杆上的成千只灯笼和彩色电灯照得通亮。
    出席宴会的有三百多人，其中包括缅甸副总理吴觉迎，副总理兼外交部长和掸邦邦长藻昆卓，克钦邦邦长吴赞塔信，努夫人，缅甸各部部长以及各国驻缅甸外交使节。
    宴会后，仰光、曼德勒和其他城市的国立师范学院的学生为客人们表演了歌唱和舞蹈的节目。主人还赠送给中国客人各种礼物，其中有象牙雕刻、挂在象牙上的银锣、缅甸的漆器以及镶着红玉的金制装饰品。
    新华社仰光19日电　周恩来总理12月18日应邀在缅甸最高学府仰光大学发表演说（演说全文见第二版）。
    周恩来总理在下午三时在吴巴瑞总理和贺龙副总理陪同下到达仰光大学的时候，女学生向他献花，一千五百名学生起立鼓掌欢迎。
    仰光大学副校长吴波基致欢迎词的时候说，仰光大学对于周恩来总理的访问感到荣幸。
    周恩来总理的演说被听众的热烈掌声打断了二十多次。
    当周恩来总理发表完演说离开礼堂的时候，许多学生站在椅子上鼓掌欢送。
