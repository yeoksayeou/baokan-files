Xinhua News Agency, December 28th. (TASS, Cairo, December 27th dispatch): Egyptian President Nasser, when receiving a group of Soviet journalists, said that one conclusion Arab countries have drawn from the Anglo-French and Israeli aggression against Egypt is that colonialism and independence cannot coexist.

He said that other conclusions drawn by Arab countries include: colonialism will still attempt to achieve its goals through conspiracies, as it did in Syria; the threat of colonialism as a military force is diminishing because the world will not allow it to use military force; and Israel is a springboard for colonialism and a pawn in the realization of colonialist conspiracies.

Nasser emphasized that the imperialists have not abandoned their aggressive intentions. He said, "Our struggle is not over. We will always fight against colonialist conspiracies that infringe upon Egypt's freedom and sovereignty."

Before answering reporters' questions, Nasser, when receiving reporters from Soviet newspapers such as "Pravda," "Izvestia," and TASS, expressed his gratitude for the support and assistance given by the Soviet Union during Egypt's difficult times.

Nasser told the Soviet journalists that, after this aggression, the idea of coexistence with all countries has been further consolidated in the minds of the people of all countries. The main result of this aggression is that Arab nationalism has demonstrated its strength.

When answering a question about the prospects for resolving the Suez Canal issue, Nasser said, "We agree with international cooperation, but we oppose any rule, including rule in the name of 'international management.' International management and supervision are new forms of colonialism, that is, collective colonialism."

A reporter asked, "What new steps should be taken to ease the tension in the Near East region?" Nasser replied that the first step should be taken by the colonial countries. They must recognize the independence and freedom of the people of all countries in the region, they must stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and they must abandon the idea of ​​seeing this region as their sphere of influence.

Nasser said that the Israeli issue is the second factor. This issue contains two main aspects: the first is the border issue, and the second is the Palestinian refugee issue. There are now one million Palestinian residents who are displaced and deprived of their property. To solve this problem, the rights of Palestinian Arabs must be restored to them.

However, the Suez Canal issue remains the main cause of this tension. The Suez Canal is within Egyptian territory, it is managed by Egypt, and it is also a part of this country. If they attempt to seize our canal, that is interference in our internal affairs, and we will resolutely oppose it.

After answering the reporters' questions, Nasser gave a speech in which he gave the Soviet journalists a brief explanation of the background of the events in Egypt. He described the reasons why the Egyptian army rose up in 1952 to overthrow Farouk's feudal rule, described Egypt's efforts to consolidate national independence after the establishment of the republic, and exposed the imperialists' various conspiracies to continue riding on the heads of the Egyptian people.

Nasser said, "I do not think that the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company was the main reason for the Anglo-French aggression. Egypt advocates strengthening Arab nationalism. All Arab countries should cooperate with each other to defend against aggression. We oppose dividing the world into spheres of influence, and we oppose British influence. We oppose Britain's attempts to divide Arab unity. We are helping the liberation struggle of the people of North Africa. That is why Britain and France believe that the existence of an independent Egypt is contrary to their interests." He also pointed out that this is not the first aggression from Britain and France. This is already the fifth time.

    纳赛尔总统对苏联记者表示
    埃及将永远同殖民主义阴谋作斗争
    坚决反对任何夺走和统治苏伊士运河的企图
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社开罗27日讯：埃及总统纳赛尔在接见一批苏联记者时说，阿拉伯国家从英法和以色列对埃及的侵略中得出的一个结论是：殖民主义和独立是不能共处的。
    他说，阿拉伯国家得出的其他结论还有：殖民主义将仍然企图利用阴谋手段来达到自己的目的，像在叙利亚所做的一样；殖民主义作为军事力量的威胁正在缩小，因为世界不允许它使用军事力量；以色列是殖民主义的跳板和实现殖民主义者阴谋的走卒。
    纳赛尔强调说，帝国主义者没有放弃自己的侵略企图。他说，我们的斗争还没有结束。我们将永远同侵犯埃及的自由和主权的殖民主义阴谋作斗争。
    纳赛尔在接见苏联“真理报”、“消息报”等报刊和塔斯社的记者时，在答复记者的问题之前，表示感谢苏联在埃及艰难的时期给予的支持和帮助。
    纳赛尔对苏联记者说，在这次侵略以后，同所有国家共处的思想在各国人民的意识中更加巩固了。这次侵略主要的结果是，阿拉伯的民族主义表现出了力量。
    纳赛尔在答复关于苏伊士运河问题解决的前景的问题时说，我们赞同国际合作，但是我们反对任何统治，其中包括以“国际管理”为名义的统治。国际管理和监督是新形式的殖民主义，也就是集体殖民主义。
    有记者问，为了缓和近东地区的紧张局势，应当采取哪些新的步骤？纳赛尔回答说，第一步应当由殖民国家来做。它们必须承认这个地区各国人民的独立和自由，它们必须停止干涉其他国家的内政，并且放弃把这个地区看成是它们的势力范围的想法。
    纳赛尔说，以色列问题是第二个因素。这个问题包含两个主要方面：第一是国界问题，第二是巴勒斯坦的难民问题。现在有一百万巴勒斯坦居民流离失所，并且被剥夺了财产。要解决这个问题，必须把巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的权利还给他们。
    可是，苏伊士运河问题仍然是这种紧张局势的主要原因。苏伊士运河在埃及领土内，它由埃及管理，也是这个国家的一部分。如果他们企图把我们的运河夺走，那就是干涉我们的内政，我们将坚决反对这样做。
    纳赛尔在答复记者问题之后，发表了谈话，他就在埃及发生的事件的背景向苏联记者们作了一个简略的说明。他叙述了埃及军队在1952年起来推翻法鲁克封建统治的原因，叙述了埃及在建立共和国以后为巩固民族独立而进行的努力，并且揭露了帝国主义者企图继续骑在埃及人民头上的种种阴谋。
    纳赛尔说，我并不认为，苏伊士运河公司的国有化是英法发动这次侵略的主要原因。埃及主张加强阿拉伯民族主义。一切阿拉伯国家应当彼此合作，防御侵略。我们反对把世界划分成势力范围，并且反对英国的势力。我们反对英国分裂阿拉伯国家团结的企图。我们帮助北非人民的解放斗争。就是因为这样，英国和法国认为一个独立的埃及的存在是同它们的利益相抵触的。他还指出，这不是来自英法方面的第一次侵略。这已经是第五次了。
