Why Can't We Buy Tung Oil Here?
　　——Hoping Commercial Departments Will Reasonably Adjust Tung Oil Prices

　　On October 14th, I and several comrades arrived at the Tongda Agricultural Cooperative in Lujiang County, Anhui. This cooperative is located in a large embankment, with over 74,000 mu of paddy fields and 408 fishing boats. During the winter and spring, they fish in Chaohu Lake.

　　Our boat entered the embankment at the cooperative's entrance. Wherever we went, as long as we talked to the cooperative's cadres or members about the year's production situation, everyone raised the same question: Why can't we buy tung oil?

　　To understand the situation and reasons, we held a forum.

　　Not long after the forum started, everyone continuously raised the issue that the cooperative urgently needed tung oil but was severely lacking it. The 408 fishing boats need more than 15,000 jin of tung oil each time they are oiled, but after great effort, they only managed to buy 12,000 jin from the Chaoxian Aquatic Products Company, leaving a shortfall of more than 3,000 jin. The cooperative's waterwheels, plows, harrows, rice threshing barrels, manure buckets, chamber pots, bathtubs, and many agricultural tools used in the paddy fields all need tung oil, but they are also unable to buy it. An elderly cooperative member said: In previous years, the average farmer would use about 15 jin of tung oil per year. If we extrapolate based on this ratio, the entire cooperative would need 126,000 jin of tung oil. And what is the actual supply this year? Everyone sighed and said: If we don't count the 12,000 jin obtained from the Aquatic Products Company for oiling fishing boats (the Aquatic Products Company supplies tung oil because they need to buy fish), there are only 800 jin of tung oil available for oiling agricultural tools, which is only one-one hundred and fifty-eighth of the required amount.

　　The cooperative members expressed great concern about this situation. They said: The cooperative has 3,086 waterwheels. Waterwheel spokes that are oiled with tung oil can last for three years, while those without tung oil will break down in a year. Waterwheel buckets that are oiled with tung oil can last for ten years, while those without tung oil will break down in two years. The same is true for plows and harrows. Those that are oiled with tung oil every year can last for more than ten or even twenty years, while those without tung oil will break down in two or three years at most. A production team leader said: Of the 3,086 waterwheels, two-thirds of the waterwheel spokes have already become misshapen before the year is even over. Everyone, think about it, a waterwheel was valued at an average of 28 yuan when it joined the cooperative, which amounts to more than 86,000 yuan in total. Buying new waterwheels is even more expensive, costing 32 yuan each. If this continues, what a huge loss it will be! Then, everyone presented many specific examples to illustrate the cooperative members' anxiety about not being able to buy tung oil. Some elderly cooperative members were angry about the lack of tung oil. They said: If we can't buy tung oil for another two years, even eighty-year-olds will have to learn carpentry (meaning that without tung oil, agricultural tools will break down more often). Many people asked: Where has all the tung oil gone that we used to have? The people attending the forum gave the following answers:

　　In 1948, before liberation, one jin of tung oil cost 14 or 15 jin of rice. In the spring of 1949, shortly after liberation, some unscrupulous merchants manipulated the market, and the price of tung oil was unstable, once rising to over 20 jin of rice per jin of tung oil. From 1953 onwards, one jin of tung oil only cost a little over 5 jin of rice. Production team leader Xu Taiyun said that this was the cheapest price he could remember. This year, the market price of tung oil is slightly higher, but it is only 6 jiao and 3 fen per jin, equivalent to about 6 jin of rice.

　　But what is the purchase price of tung oil in the mountain areas?

　　Cooperative member Zhang Jiacang said that he has a relative whose family used to have tung oil trees, but because the price of tung oil has been low in recent years, they cut down their tung oil trees. The deputy secretary of the district committee who attended the forum also said that when he went to the Wuhu Prefectural Committee to attend a forum for agricultural cooperative directors, he asked a cooperative director in the mountain area why it was so difficult to buy tung oil this year. The director replied: One person can only peel two jin of tung oil fruit in a day, and each jin can only be sold for one jiao and five fen, which is not even worth half a load of firewood. If we let it rot on the trees, no one will bother to pick it. Wu Zhaolin, the deputy director of the Tongda Cooperative, went to Machao in the mountain area of ​​Shucheng County this year to buy tung oil. The people in the mountain area said: You're still coming to buy tung oil? In another three years, I'm afraid the tung trees will be cut down at the roots.

　　In order to guarantee the country's need for tung oil in construction, and in order for the cooperative members to be able to buy tung oil, everyone unanimously requested that the commercial departments in charge of tung oil at the national level should not only limit the quantity of tung oil supplied, but should also reasonably adjust the price of tung oil to increase the interest of farmers in mountainous areas in planting tung trees.

### 这里为什么买不到桐油？——希望商业部门合理调整桐油价格

　　这里为什么买不到桐油？
　  ——希望商业部门合理调整桐油价格
    10月14日，我和几个同志到了安徽庐江县的同大农业社。这个社在一个大圩里，全社有七万四千多亩水田，还有四百零八只鱼船，冬春两季，在巢湖里捕鱼。
    我们的船开到大社门口上了圩，不论走到那里，只要一和社里的干部或者社员谈到今年的生产的情况，大家一致提出这样一个问题：为什么买不到桐油？
    为了弄清楚情况和原因，我们召开了一个座谈会。
    座谈会开始没有多大时间，大家就接连不断地提出社里迫切需要桐油而又非常缺少桐油。四百零八只鱼船，今年上一次桐油，就要一万五千多斤，可是费了九牛二虎之力，才从巢县水产公司买到了一万二千斤，还差三千多斤没有来路。社里的水车、犁、耙、打稻桶、挑粪桶、马桶、洗澡盆，以及许多水田用的农具，都需要桐油，也都买不到。一个年老的社员说：在往常年，一般农民平均每家一年大约要用十五斤桐油，如果按这个比例推算起来，全社就要用十二万六千斤桐油。而今年得到的实际供应数是多少呢？大家叹了一口气说：如果不算从水产公司搞来油鱼船的那一万二千斤（水产公司供给桐油，是因为他们需要买鱼），可以用来油农具的，只有八百斤桐油，仅仅达到需要数量的一百五十八分之一。
    对于这种情况，社员们表现了极大的忧虑。他们说：全社有三千零八十六辆水车，上了桐油的水车辐子能用三年，没有上桐油的水车辐子一年就用坏了；上了桐油的水车桶子能用十年，不上桐油的水车桶子两年就用坏了。犁、耙也是一样，年年上桐油的，可以用上十多年，甚至二十多年，不上桐油的，顶多二、三年就用坏了。一个生产分队长说：三千零八十六辆水车，今年一年还没到头，已经有三分之二的水车辐子走了样子，大家算算，一辆水车入社时平均折价二十八元，总共就要八万六千多元，买新的水车更贵，一辆就要三十二元，这样下去，该是多大的损失！接着大家又提出了许多具体的事例，说明社员们对于买不到桐油的焦急的心情。有些老年社员对于没有桐油感到生气，他们说：再过二年买不到桐油，连八十岁的老头子也得学木匠了（意思是说没有桐油，农具坏的多）。许多人都问：从前那些桐油，现在弄到那里去了呢？到会座谈的人们作了下面的回答：
    1948年，临解放前，买一斤桐油要十四、五斤米；1949年春天，刚刚解放不久，还有奸商操纵，桐油市价不稳，曾经涨到买一斤桐油要二十多斤米；从1953年以后，一斤桐油只要五斤多米。生产队长徐太云说，这是他记得事情以来最便宜的价钱。今年，桐油市价略高了一点，也只六角三分一斤，折合六斤来米。
    但是，山区桐油的收购价格怎样呢？
    社员张家仓说：他有一个亲戚，家里原来是有桐油树的，但是由于这几年来桐油卖不上价钱，便把他家的桐油树砍了。参加座谈会的区委副书记也说，他到芜湖地委开农业社主任座谈会的时候，曾经问过山区一个合作社主任，为什么今年老是买不到桐油？这个主任回答说：剥桐油果子，一个人一天只能剥得二斤，每斤只能卖上一角半钱，合共不顶半担柴钱，要是让它烂在树上，保管没人摘它。同大社的副主任吴兆林，今年到舒城县山区马槽去买桐油，山区的群众说：你还来买桐油哩，再过三年，桐树还怕要断根了。
    为了保证国家建设中对于桐油的需要，为了使社员们能买到桐油，大家一致要求国家管理桐油的商业部门，不要单单只是限制桐油供应的数量，而应该合理调整桐油价格，提高山区农民栽植桐树的兴趣。
