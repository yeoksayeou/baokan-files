Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The National Coal Cadre Conference, which concluded today, made relatively reasonable arrangements for the 1957 national state-owned coal industry production and capital construction plans, based on the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

    The conference discussed the state-issued control targets for next year's state-owned coal mine production, believing that to complete next year's coal production plan, great efforts must still be made, especially to make safety work one of the central tasks for next year.

    In view of the fact that the state's investment in the coal industry next year will be slightly less than this year, while the needs of various sectors of the national economy, especially the ferrous metallurgical industry, for coal are very urgent, the conference decided that next year's capital construction investment will focus on mines and coal washing plants that are under continued construction, particularly to ensure the construction of forty pairs of mines with a total designed capacity of more than ten million tons to be put into production next year. Construction will also begin next year on four coal preparation plants and three new pairs of mines. Some projects that can be temporarily delayed will be temporarily suspended next year.

    In recent years, insufficient attention has been paid to safety measures in producing mines in the coal industry. In order to maintain and improve the production capacity of existing mines, investment in safety-related projects and equipment will increase more next year than this year.

    The state built 1.6 million square meters of housing for coal mine workers across the country this year. In accordance with the principle of gradually improving the living standards and welfare of workers, another 1.3 million square meters of new housing will be built next year.

    Minister of the Coal Industry Chen Yu made a summary at the meeting. He emphasized that although the investment in coal mines next year will be slightly less than this year, the task of capital construction is still very large and there are still many difficulties. Therefore, we must pay attention to preventing complacency. In terms of production, we must also prevent one-sided emphasis on objective difficulties, while failing to see the favorable factors.

### 煤炭工业部妥善安排明年计划

    煤炭工业部妥善安排明年计划
    据新华社12日讯　今天结束的全国煤炭干部会议根据中共中央二中全会指示的精神，对1957年全国国营煤炭工业生产和基本建设的计划，做了比较合理的安排。
    会议讨论了国家颁发的明年国营煤矿生产的控制指标，认为要完成明年煤炭的生产计划，还必须作很大的努力，特别是要把做好安全工作当作明年的中心任务之一。
    鉴于明年国家对煤炭工业的投资比今年稍为减少，而国民经济各个部门特别是黑色冶金工业的发展对煤炭的需要又很急迫，会议决定明年基本建设的投资将着重用在继续建设的矿井、洗煤厂，特别是要保证明年移交生产的设计能力总共在一千万吨以上的四十对矿井的建设。明年开工兴建的还有四个选煤厂和三对新的矿井。有一些可以暂时缓建的工程明年暂时停止建设。
    几年来在煤炭工业方面对生产矿井的安全措施是注意不够的。为了维护和提高原有矿井的生产能力，明年对有关安全的工程和设备方面的投资将比今年有较多的增长。
    国家今年给全国煤矿职工建筑了一百六十万平方公尺的住宅，根据逐步改善职工生活福利的方针，明年还要新建住宅一百三十万平方公尺。
    煤炭工业部部长陈郁在会上作了总结。他强调指出，明年煤矿的投资虽然比今年稍为减少，但是基本建设的任务还是很大的，困难还是很多的，因此，必须注意防止松劲思想。在生产方面，也要防止片面地强调客观困难，而看不到有利因素。
