The Second Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce heard the instructions of Vice Premier Chen Yun and Vice Premier Bo Yibo, discussed the report by Chairman Chen Shutong entitled "National Industrialists and Businessmen, Continue to Accept Socialist Transformation, Give Full Play to Active Roles, and Strive for the Great Socialist Construction of Our Country," and unanimously expressed support. In particular, on the eve of the congress, Chairman Mao once again gave cordial guidance to the chairman, vice-chairmen, and heads of various delegations of our All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, which greatly encouraged us. All the representatives unanimously guaranteed that they would follow Chairman Mao's teachings and implement the spirit of the instructions of Vice Premiers Chen Yun and Bo Yibo and the report of Chairman Chen Shutong, and hereby make the following resolution:

First, we industrialists and businessmen must recognize that the state values our talents, arranges our work, and cares for our lives in order to enable us to study and work with peace of mind and enhance our enthusiasm. We must further promote the spirit of patriotism, strengthen self-remolding, clarify the consistency of national and individual interests, contribute our useful technologies and experiences in production and management to the socialist construction of the motherland, be diligent and conscientious, fulfill our duties, actively participate in socialist competitions, and actively serve the people.

Second, due to the basic completion of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the relationship between us industrialists and businessmen and the masses of workers in joint state-private enterprises or state-owned enterprises is already a relationship of working together, and also a class relationship. We must accept the leadership of the public side, respect the opinions of the masses of workers, and approach the public side and workers with a positive and correct attitude, learn from them, and strive for their support and assistance.

Since we were opposed to the workers for a long time in the past, we must now take the initiative and strive, through practical actions, to get the workers to change their views of us, shorten the distance between us and the workers, further improve the relationship of working together, and strive to transform this relationship of working together into a socialist relationship of comradely love and mutual assistance.

Third, in order to contribute to the socialist construction of the motherland in our respective jobs, industrialists and businessmen in various industries, large, medium, and small, must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, start from unity and further strengthen unity among private individuals through criticism and self-criticism. We are all working for the country and the people, our goals are common, and our interests are consistent. We must help each other, supervise each other, and move forward together with full confidence.

Fourth, since the establishment of joint state-private ownership throughout the industry, our positive aspects are constantly improving, and our negative aspects are gradually shrinking, but the dual nature still exists. In order to further enhance our active role, continue to eliminate our negative factors, and better achieve the goal of destroying capitalism and establishing socialism, we must combine our work practice and further strengthen the study of political theory, so that we can further understand the objective laws of social development, gradually change our capitalist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, raise our socialist consciousness, cultivate the thoughts and feelings of the working people, and firmly establish our confidence in taking the socialist road.

The congress responded to Vice Premier Chen Yun's call to us in his report, and based on the above spirit, once again clearly pointed out that we industrialists and businessmen in various industries must take the following five points as the basic principles that we jointly abide by:

1. Continue to promote the spirit of patriotism, contribute all our talents to the country, and serve the socialist construction of the motherland;
2. Be dutiful, frugal, and industrious, cultivate a hard-working and simple style, work hard, and actively participate in socialist competitions;
3. Further improve the relationship between the public and private sides, especially to obey the leadership of the public side and approach the masses of workers with a positive and correct attitude;
4. Further improve the relationship between us private individuals, use criticism and self-criticism to strengthen unity, in order to achieve common progress;
5. Strengthen the study of political theory, gradually eliminate old ideas and old styles, and raise socialist consciousness.

All the representatives unanimously guaranteed that they would guard against arrogance and impetuosity, work hard, lead by example, resolutely implement the spirit of the congress, convey it well to industrialists and businessmen throughout the country, and promote the industrialists and businessmen of the whole country to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, abide by the basic principles determined by the congress, give full play to their expertise in production and management, contribute all their strength, gradually transform themselves into laborers in the true sense of the word, and, together with the people of the whole country, fight to the end for the prosperity and strength of the motherland, the lasting peace of the world, and the just cause of mankind.

    中华全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会
    关于全国工商业者进一步发扬爱国主义精神，继续加强自我改造，积极为社会主义建设作出贡献的决议
    中华全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会，全体代表听了陈云副总理、薄一波副总理的指示，讨论了陈叔通主任委员的“全国工商业者，继续接受社会主义改造，充分发挥积极作用，为我国伟大的社会主义建设而奋斗”的报告，一致表示拥护。特别是大会前夕，毛主席又一次地对我们全国工商业联合会的正副主任委员及各代表团负责人作了亲切的教导，使我们受到了极大的鼓舞。全体代表一致保证，要遵循毛主席的教导，并贯彻陈云、薄一波两位副总理的指示和陈叔通主任委员的报告的精神，特作出决议如下：
    第一、我们工商业者必须认识，国家重视我们的才能，安排我们的工作，关心我们的生活，就是为了使我们能够安心学习，安心工作，提高我们的积极性。我们必须进一步发扬爱国主义精神，加强自我改造，明确国家利益和个人利益的一致性，把我们对于生产经营的有用的技术和经验，贡献给祖国的社会主义建设事业，勤勤恳恳，守职尽责，踊跃地参加社会主义竞赛，积极地为人民服务。
    第二、由于资本主义工商业社会主义改造的基本完成，我们工商业者在公私合营企业或国营企业中同职工群众的关系，已经是共同工作关系，同时也是阶级关系。我们必须接受公方的领导，尊重职工群众的意见，并且以积极的、正确的态度靠拢公方和职工，向他们学习，争取他们的支持和帮助。
    由于过去我们长时期内是和职工对立的，现在我们必须主动努力，以实际行动，争取职工改变对我们的观感，缩短我们同职工的距离，进一步改进共事关系，并争取把这种共事关系改变为社会主义的同志间友爱互助的关系。
    第三、我们大中小各行各业的工商业者，为了在自己工作岗位上对祖国的社会主义建设作出贡献，必须在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，从团结出发，通过批评与自我批评，进一步加强私私之间的团结。我们大家都是在为国家和人民工作，目标是共同的，利益是一致的，我们必须互相帮助、互相督促，满怀信心地一道前进。
    第四、自从全行业公私合营以来，我们的积极一面正在不断提高，消极一面正在逐步缩小，但两面性还是存在。为了进一步提高我们的积极作用，继续消除我们的消极因素，更好地达到破资本主义、立社会主义的目的，我们必须结合工作实践，进一步加强政治理论学习，使我们更加认识到社会发展的客观规律，逐步改变资本主义的立场、观点和方法，提高社会主义觉悟，培养劳动人民的思想感情，坚定走社会主义道路的信心。
    大会响应陈云副总理在报告中对我们的号召，根据上述精神，再一次地明确指出，我们各行各业工商业者，必须把下列五点作为我们共同遵守的基本准则：
    1、继续发扬爱国主义精神，把自己的一切才能贡献给国家，为祖国的社会主义建设服务；
    2、守职尽责，克勤克俭，养成艰苦朴素作风，努力工作，积极参加社会主义竞赛；
    3、进一步改进公私共事关系，尤其要以积极的、正确的态度，服从公方领导，靠拢职工群众；
    4、进一步改进我们私私之间的关系，运用批评与自我批评，加强团结，以求得共同进步；
    5、加强政治理论学习，逐步消除旧思想、旧作风，提高社会主义觉悟。
    全体代表一致保证，要戒骄戒躁，艰苦奋斗，以身作则，坚决贯彻大会的精神，并向全国工商业者作好传达，推动全国工商业者更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，遵守大会决定的基本准则，在生产经营上充分发挥自己的专长，贡献自己的一切力量，逐步把自己改造为名副其实的劳动者，和全国人民一道，为祖国的富强繁荣、世界的持久和平以及人类的正义事业而奋斗到底。
