    The People of China and Myanmar are Close Brothers
    From December 10th to 20th, our Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long paid a friendly visit to Myanmar and held cordial talks with Myanmar's Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu, and other leaders on issues concerning the interests of both countries and certain pressing issues of international importance. During this period, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long also visited many places in Myanmar and were warmly welcomed by the Myanmar people everywhere. At the same time, Prime Minister U Ba Swe also came with Premier Zhou Enlai to Mangshi, Yunnan Province, China, to attend the joint celebration meeting of the people on the Sino-Myanmar border. These activities have added a new chapter to the history of friendly relations between China and Myanmar, greatly encouraging the people of both countries. The Chinese people heard a very cordial saying from the Myanmar people: The people of China and Myanmar are "Pauk-Phaw," close brothers! Indeed, this sentence can also express the deep feelings of the Chinese people for the Myanmar people.
    China and Myanmar are close neighbors. With more than 2,000 kilometers of common border and more than 1,000 years of traditional relations, our friendship is infinitely precious. In recent years, after both China and Myanmar won independence and freedom, we have established a more solid foundation of friendship based on the common aspirations of the people of both countries, and based on new historical conditions and the spirit of the times, which is the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Because our two countries have strictly implemented these principles, our friendly relations have been further strengthened, and economic and cultural exchanges and mutual visits between our two countries have developed considerably. Now, we are pleased to see that the Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar reaffirmed in their joint statement that the relations between our two countries will continue to be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Undoubtedly, in the years to come, our friendly relations will continue to be strengthened and continue to grow.
    Our two countries have many similar experiences, and many of the problems we face are the same or similar. Both of our countries have been subjected to colonial oppression for a long time, and we are both young countries that have only recently won independence. We both need peace, and we both need to work hard to build our own countries, to change the backwardness of our countries and improve the living standards of our people. Precisely because of this, we must not only respect each other and trust each other, but also learn from each other and cooperate with each other. The Chinese people have always believed that every country and every nation has its strengths, and there are things worth learning from us with an open mind. The Chinese people are willing to learn from the strengths of the Myanmar people in order to strive for the common prosperity and development of our two countries.
    The Sino-Myanmar border issue is a major issue left over from history that is relatively complex and remains to be resolved. In the historical process of China and Myanmar jointly suffering from colonial oppression, imperialism not only created and deepened the disputes between China and Myanmar on the border issue, but has also been using these disputes to provoke the national sentiments of the people of China and Myanmar, in order to achieve its colonialist goals. But history has finally turned a new page. Since its founding, the People's Republic of China has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and advocated that all countries, regardless of size, should be fully respected and treated equally. Myanmar has also broken free from imperialist oppression and become a nationally independent country. China and Myanmar have also established friendly relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This new situation enables China and Myanmar to discuss fair and reasonable solutions to the Sino-Myanmar border issue. The Prime Ministers of China and Myanmar pointed out in their joint statement: "The Prime Ministers of the two countries also discussed the resolution of the Sino-Myanmar border issue in a spirit of sincere mutual understanding. These discussions further clarified the views of China and Myanmar and brought the issue closer to a satisfactory solution for both parties." We believe that as long as both China and Myanmar adopt a realistic attitude, resolutely act in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and conduct full consultations on the basis of mutual respect, this issue will not be difficult to gradually resolve reasonably. Any outstanding issues between our two countries will not become an obstacle to our friendship.
    Let the people of China and Myanmar work together to set a better example of friendly cooperation, and together with peace-loving people from all countries, constantly expand the beneficial influence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence throughout the world. Let us take the phrase "The people of China and Myanmar are close brothers" as a banner, a torch, and pass it on from generation to generation, enduring forever!

### 中缅两国人民是亲兄弟

    中缅两国人民是亲兄弟
    从12月10日至20日，我国周恩来总理和贺龙副总理到缅甸作了友好访问，并同缅甸总理吴巴瑞、反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努以及其他领导人，就有关两国利益的问题和某些具有国际重要性的迫切问题进行了融洽的会谈。在这期间，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理还访问了缅甸许多地方，到处受到了缅甸人民的热烈欢迎。同时吴巴瑞总理还同周恩来总理一起来到我国云南省芒市，参加了中缅边境人民联欢大会。这些活动给中缅两国友好关系史增添了新的篇章，使我们两国人民都受到极大的鼓舞。中国人民从缅甸人民那里听到了一句非常亲切的话：中缅两国人民是“胞波”，是亲兄弟！的确，这句话同样也可以表达中国人民对缅甸人民的深厚感情。
    中国和缅甸是亲密的邻邦。二千多公里的共同边境，一千多年的传统关系，我们之间的友谊是无限珍贵的。近些年来，在中缅两国都赢得了独立自由以后，我们根据两国人民的共同愿望，根据新的历史条件和时代精神，建立了更巩固的友谊基础，这就是和平共处的五项原则。由于我们两国严格执行了这些原则，我们的友好关系已经进一步加强了，我们两国之间的经济文化交流和互相往来有了相当大的发展。现在，我们高兴地看到，中缅两国总理在他们的联合声明中重申，我们两国的关系将继续以和平共处五项原则为基础。无疑地，在未来的岁月中，我们之间的友好关系还要不断地加强，不断地增长。
    我们两国有着许多相同的经历，面临着的问题也有许多是相同的或者相类似的。我们两国都曾经长期受到殖民主义的压迫，我们又都是赢得独立还不久的年轻国家。我们都需要和平，都需要努力来建设自己的国家，以改变我们国家的落后面貌，提高人民的生活水平。正是因为这样，我们不仅要互相尊重，互相信任，而且要互相学习，互相合作。中国人民一向认为，任何一个国家，一个民族，都有它的长处，都有值得我们虚心学习的东西。中国人民愿意学习缅甸人民的长处，以争取我们两国的共同繁荣和发展。
    中缅边境问题是历史上遗留下来的一个较为复杂而尚待解决的重大问题。在中缅两国共同遭受殖民主义压迫的历史过程中，帝国主义不仅制造和加深了中缅双方在边界问题上的争执，而且一直在利用这些争执来挑拨中缅两国人民的民族感情，以图达到它的殖民主义的目的。但是历史终于展开了新的一页。中华人民共和国成立后一贯执行和平外交政策，和主张一切国家不论大小都应得到充分尊重和平等相待。缅甸也已经挣脱帝国主义的压迫，成为民族独立的国家。中缅两国并且在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立了友好的关系。这种新的情况使得中缅两国能够就中缅边界问题商讨公平合理的解决办法。中缅两国总理在联合声明中指出：“两国总理在热诚的相互谅解的精神下也讨论了解决中缅边界的问题。这些讨论进一步澄清了中缅两国的观点，并使这一问题更接近于达到双方满意的解决。”我们相信，只要中缅双方都抱着实事求是的态度，坚决按照和平共处五项原则办事，在互相尊重的基础上进行充分的协商，这个问题就不难逐步得到合理的解决。我们两国之间的任何悬而未决的问题，都不会成为我们的友谊的障碍。
    让我们中缅两国人民共同努力做出友好合作的更好的榜样，并同各国爱好和平人民一道，不断扩大和平共处五项原则在全世界的有益影响。让我们把“中缅两国人民是亲兄弟”这句话当作一面旗帜，一把火炬，一代一代地传下去而万世不绝！
