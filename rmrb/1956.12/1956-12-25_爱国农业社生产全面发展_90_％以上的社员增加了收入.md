Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, December 22nd. (Xinhua reporter Cao Xuepu reports): The Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative, led by national agricultural labor model and National People's Congress representative Lü Hongbin, harvested a total of over 6,183,000 jin of grain this year (excluding soybeans). The average yield per unit area not only increased by 34% compared to last year but also exceeded the original plan by 4.4 jin.

To strive for a bumper harvest of crops, the Patriotic Cooperative improved the soil of over 3,000 mu of farmland as early as last winter. This spring, the spring land was also universally compacted and thoroughly harrowed to retain underground moisture, ensuring timely sowing of crops. The cooperative also organized members to adopt various methods to accumulate fertilizer. The amount of penned manure alone increased by more than 40 million jin compared to last year, increasing the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of farmland from 1,400 jin last year to 2,100 jin. In addition, the cooperative also increased the planting of high-yield crops according to local conditions and popularized the planting area of improved varieties, which also created favorable conditions for this year's increased grain production.

The Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative encountered many difficulties in the process of striving for a bumper harvest of crops. At the end of June, a strong typhoon struck here, breaking or lodging a quarter of the cooperative's corn; at the same time, it rained heavily for several days in a row, flooding more than 1,500 mu of crops. At this time, the members of the cooperative immediately carried out rescue work. After several days and nights of hard work, they dug more than a hundred drainage ditches, quickly draining the water from the fields; they also supported and earthed up the fallen corn and millet and applied additional fertilizer. Therefore, the yield was not greatly affected.

The Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative has also restored and developed 18 kinds of sideline occupations, such as carpentry, transportation, brick making, and cotton ginning, according to the conditions within the cooperative. These sideline occupations have already generated a profit of 75,000 yuan from January to November this year, and it is expected that the plan of 80,000 yuan will be overfulfilled by the end of the year.

As a result of the comprehensive development of production in this cooperative, not only have more than 90% of the members increased their income compared to last year, but also the lives of more than 220 households who have lost their ability to work or have poor labor ability have been guaranteed.

    爱国农业社生产全面发展
    90％以上的社员增加了收入
    新华社临沂22日电　新华社记者曹学璞报道：全国农业劳动模范、全国人民代表大会代表吕鸿宾领导的爱国农业社，今年共收粮食（不包括大豆）六百一十八万三千多斤。平均单位面积产量不仅比去年增产34％，而且超过原订计划四点四斤。
    爱国社为争取农作物丰收，早在去年冬季就改良了三千多亩农田的土壤。今春，对春地又普遍进行了镇压和透耙，保持了地下水分，使农作物得到适时播种。这个社还组织社员采取多种方法积肥。仅圈肥一项，就比去年多四千多万斤，使每亩农田的施肥量，在去年一千四百斤的基础上增加到两千一百斤。另外，这个社还因地制宜增种高产作物，普及良种播种面积，也为今年粮食增产创造了有利条件。
    爱国农业社在争取农作物丰收的过程中，曾经遇到许多困难。6月底，这里遭到了强台风的袭击，全社四分之一的玉米被风刮断或倒伏；同时，又连续降了数日大雨，使一千五百多亩农作物被淹。这时，这个社的社员立即进行抢救。经过几个日夜的努力，抢挖百余条顺水沟，很快排出田间积水；对那些倒伏的玉米和谷子也进行了架扶培土和追肥，因此，产量没有受很大的影响。
    爱国农业社还根据社内条件，恢复与发展了木业、运输、烧窑和轧棉花等十八种副业。这些副业，从今年1月到11月，已经获利七万五千元，预计到年底将可超额完成八万元的计划。
    这个社全面发展生产的结果，不仅90％以上的社员都比去年增加了收入，而且二百二十多户失去劳动能力或劳动能力差的社员，生活也得到了保证。
