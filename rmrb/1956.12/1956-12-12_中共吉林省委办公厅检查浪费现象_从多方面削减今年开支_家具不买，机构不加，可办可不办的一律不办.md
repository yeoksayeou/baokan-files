CCP Jilin Provincial Committee General Office Inspects Wasteful Practices
Cutting Expenditures in Various Ways This Year
No New Furniture, No New Institutions, Anything Dispensable Will Not Be Done

(Our dispatch) The General Office of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is taking the lead in reducing this year's expenditures by more than 127,000 yuan.

In late November, the General Office of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party responded to the call of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and universally inspected and exposed wasteful phenomena this year. It was discovered that in the past eleven months, there had been many unnecessary expenditures in printing costs, entertainment expenses, repair costs, and procurement expenses, wasting approximately more than 8,500 yuan. This is not in line with the Party's spirit of hard work, plain living, and building the country through diligence and thrift.

In response to this situation, the Provincial Committee General Office put forward many improvement measures and vigorously tightened this year's expenditures. Some expenditure items that could be done or not done were all reduced. Some furniture and office supplies that were planned to be purchased this year will no longer be purchased. In this way, more than 127,000 yuan was cut from this year's budget. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient office housing for the agencies, it was decided to extract more than 170 square meters of housing from the existing offices and allocate it to departments with insufficient housing. At the same time, measures such as "adjustment, merging rooms, and partitioning" were also taken to solve the housing difficulties of 40 staff members. No new institutions or establishments will be added this year, and vacancies will not be filled. Civil servants in the dormitories of cadres at or above the ministerial level have all been canceled, thereby reducing the civil service establishment by 33%. Regulations have also been made regarding the use of cars to save gasoline as much as possible.

On December 9, the Jilin Daily published an editorial on this matter, criticizing the erroneous view that "increasing production and practicing economy is only the business of industrial departments, and administrative agencies have nothing to save." At the same time, it severely criticized the wasteful behavior of some agencies and enterprises that arbitrarily added budgets and rushed to spend money at the end of the year. It called on all agencies and enterprises in the province to tighten expenditures and practice economy like the Provincial Committee General Office and to rapidly launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy.

### 中共吉林省委办公厅检查浪费现象  从多方面削减今年开支  家具不买，机构不加，可办可不办的一律不办

    中共吉林省委办公厅检查浪费现象
    从多方面削减今年开支
    家具不买，机构不加，可办可不办的一律不办
    本报讯　中共吉林省委办公厅带头削减今年经费开支十二万七千多元。
    11月下旬，中共吉林省委办公厅响应党的八届二中全会的号召，普遍检查和揭发了今年的浪费现象，发现过去十一个月当中，在印刷费、招待费、修缮费和购置费等方面，有着许多不必要的开支，大约浪费了八千五百多元。这是不符合党的艰苦朴素勤俭建国的精神的。
    省委办公厅针对这种情况，提出许多改进的措施，大力紧缩今年的开支。一些可办可不办的开支项目，都被削减。今年准备购置的一些家具和办公用品，不再购买。这样就从今年经费预算中削减十二万七千多元。为了解决机关房屋不足的困难，决定从现有办公室内抽出一百七十多平方公尺的房屋，分配给房屋不足的部门。同时，还采取“调剂、并房、打间壁”等办法，解决四十户工作人员的住宿困难。今年机构编制决不再增加，缺额也不再补充。部长级以上干部宿舍的公务员，都被取消，从而减少公务员编制33％。在使用汽车上，也作了规定，尽量节省汽油。
    吉林日报在12月9日为此发表社论，批判了那种认为“增产节约只是工业部门的事，行政机关没什么可以节约”的错误看法，同时严厉批评了一些机关企业任意追加预算，年终突击花钱的浪费行为，要求全省各机关企业都要像省委办公厅一样，紧缩开支，厉行节约，迅速开展增产节约运动。
