    Dongting Lake Dyke and Polder Winter Repair Project Commences

    (Our dispatch) Twenty-two thousand laborers are engaged in the Dongting Lake dyke and polder winter repair project. After several years of vigorous renovation, the flood resistance capacity of the Dongting Lake area's dykes and polders has been significantly improved, ensuring a large-scale bumper harvest in the lake area this year. The policy for this year's dyke and polder winter repair remains to continue to reinforce dangerous sections of the dykes, vigorously eliminate hidden dangers, focus on dredging flood channels, and ensure the safety of the main dykes. Under this premise, the main effort will be concentrated on repairing drainage systems such as ditches, harbors, and lakes within the polders, so as to gradually reduce waterlogging and drought disasters. The planned task for the entire Dongting Lake area's dyke and polder winter repair this year totals 46,880,000 cubic meters of earthwork.
