    Where there are difficulties, there are always solutions
  　Cheng Ji
    "Lacking soybeans, how can we extract oil?" This was a major difficulty encountered by the workers of the Changchun Public-Private Joint Guangtaiheng Oil Factory. From the second quarter of this year, this factory began to suffer from a "raw material shortage." However, the national soybean production could not meet the needs, and the Changchun Oil and Fat Company could only supply 30% of the factory's soybean needs. By the third quarter, soybeans were even scarcer, and the factory often stopped work waiting for materials. Sometimes, only one of the factory's five workshops could produce. What to do? Wait? No, because the soybean supply will not increase for a while. Keep stopping work and waiting for materials? Also no, because in the long run, it would not only waste the factory's equipment, but also would not maintain the factory's expenses.
    There was only one way out: mobilize the masses and find solutions. The factory mobilized workers and discussed the issue many times. Some veteran workers proposed using rice bran to extract oil. They experimented in the second workshop and extracted 7.4 catties of oil from 100 catties of rice bran.
    The workers' enthusiasm for finding new oil sources was even greater. Before long, they found many new raw materials that could be used for oil extraction: flax seeds, castor seeds, and perilla seeds. From then on, the difficulty of lacking soybeans was no longer a problem. The entire factory used new raw materials to extract oil, without losing money, and even making a profit. In October, they handed over 2,000 yuan to the state. Now they are studying the use of sunflower seeds and corn germ to extract oil.
    This shows that any difficulty can be overcome as long as the masses are mobilized.

    有困难，总有办法

    “缺少大豆，怎么榨油？”这是长春市公私合营广泰恒制油厂职工遭遇到的一大困难。从今年第二季度起，这个工厂就开始闹“原料荒”。可是，全国大豆产量不能满足需要，长春市油脂公司只能供给这个工厂大豆需要量的30％。到第三季度，大豆更少了，工厂常常停工待料，有时候全厂五个车间只能有一个车间生产。怎么办呢？等待吗？不行，因为大豆供应量一时不会增多。老是停工待料么？也不行，因为长期下去，不但浪费全厂的设备，而且也维持不了全厂的开支。
    出路只有一条，发动群众，想办法。工厂动员职工，讨论了多次，一些老工人提出了用稻糠榨油的办法，在第二车间试榨，用一百斤稻糠榨出了七斤四两油。
    职工们寻找新油源的劲头更足了。没有多久，又找出许多可以榨油的新原料：线麻籽、蓖麻籽和苏籽。从此，缺少大豆的困难，不再是个问题了。全厂利用新原料榨油，不亏损，还能赚钱。10月份，给国家上缴了两千元。现在他们又在研究利用葵花籽、包米脐子来榨油。
    这件事说明，任何困难，只要发动群众，总是可以克服的。
