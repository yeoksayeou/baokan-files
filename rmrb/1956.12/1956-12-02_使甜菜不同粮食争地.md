To make sugar beets not compete with grain crops for land
Tang Baoshun

Baicheng Prefecture in western Jilin Province is a sparsely populated sandy area, known as the "Eight Hundred Li Land Sea." This year, however, it has seen a bumper harvest of sugar beets on more than 12,000 hectares of land, with an average yield of over 24,000 jin per hectare and a sugar content of 18%. This is the result of an important measure taken by Jilin Province to rationally utilize land and ensure simultaneous increases in the production of both grain crops and industrial raw material crops.

This year was the first time that sugar beets were sown in the Baicheng Prefecture. In the past, people had always thought: it is difficult to produce grain here, how can we plant a large amount of sugar beets? Therefore, the raw materials for the New China Sugar Factory and the Fanjiatun Sugar Factory in Jilin Province mainly relied on the supply from Yushu, Huaide, Jiutai, Dehui and other counties in the central region. However, these counties are also the counties in Jilin Province that produce the most grain and soybeans. If a large amount of sugar beets are developed here, the sown area of ​​grain and soybeans will be reduced, and at the same time, because there is less land, reasonable crop rotation cannot be carried out, which will affect the yield and quality of sugar beets. For example, in 1953, the yield of sugar beets per hectare was about 24,000 jin, with an average sugar content of 14.3%; by 1955, the yield of sugar beets per hectare had dropped to 18,000 jin, with an average sugar content of only 11.4%. If this development continues, it will affect the development of the national sugar industry.

After Jilin Province achieved the advanced agricultural cooperative in the winter of last year, it formulated a plan for the development of agricultural production in the province. According to this plan, it is planned to gradually transfer the sugar beet production from the central grain-producing counties to the western Baicheng Prefecture, so that sugar beets do not compete with grain for land, thereby ensuring the production of grain and the supply of sugar beets. This is not a subjective fantasy. The Provincial Department of Agriculture has repeatedly sent working groups to Baicheng Prefecture to investigate the local soil and natural conditions, as well as the growth of similar crops in the past, and compared them with the natural conditions of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which has a high yield of sugar beets in neighboring areas. The investigation materials prove that if Baicheng area can do a good job in drought resistance and seedling protection, it can not only sow a large amount of sugar beets, but also produce sugar beets with high sugar content.

Before sowing, the Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture also sent a large number of technicians and agricultural cooperative directors to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to learn the experience of high-yield sugar beets. During the sowing period, the Jilin Provincial Department of Agriculture also invited forty-eight experienced farmers from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to come and provide personal guidance.

Hard work has had satisfactory results - a large area of ​​high-yield sugar beets has been obtained in this sandy area where sugar beets have never been planted before, opening up new avenues for agricultural production in the Baicheng area.

The sugar beet harvest area in Baicheng Prefecture this year is 12,057 hectares, and the actual output can reach more than 145,000 tons, accounting for about one-half of the province's actual output. This not only strongly supported the production of sugar factories, but also greatly increased the income of farmers in the Baicheng area. In the past, when Baicheng Prefecture planted dry land, each hectare of land only produced four or five shi of grain, with an income of only about 120 yuan; this year, planting sugar beets yielded about 400 yuan per hectare. At the same time, many sugar beet leaves were harvested, increasing the amount of livestock feed.

The ability to grow sugar beets in the Baicheng area also ensured the planting area of ​​grain crops, especially soybeans, in the central region of Jilin Province. This year, while vigorously developing rice, Jilin Province still overfulfilled the province's soybean planting area of ​​more than 950,000 hectares and achieved a bumper harvest. The actual output of soybeans in the province reached more than 1.09 million tons.

In order to further exploit the land potential of Baicheng Prefecture, the relevant leading departments of Jilin Province plan to expand the sugar beet planting area in this prefecture to more than 18,000 hectares next year on the basis of what it has this year.

### 使甜菜不同粮食争地

　　使甜菜不同粮食争地
　　汤宝顺
    吉林省西部的白城专区，是地广人稀的风砂地带，有人称它为“八百里地旱海”。今年，这里却出现了一万二千多公顷土地的甜菜大丰收，平均每公顷甜菜产量达到二万四千斤以上，含糖率为18％。这是吉林省合理运用土地，保证粮食作物和工业原料作物同时增产的一项重要措施的结果。
    今年在白城专区是第一次播种甜菜。过去，人们一直认为：这里生产粮食都困难，怎能大量种甜菜？因此，吉林省内的新中国制糖厂和范家屯糖厂的甜菜原料，主要依靠中部地区的榆树、怀德、九台、德惠等县供应。但这些县分又是吉林省出产粮食和大豆最多的县分。如果在这里大量发展甜菜生产，就会削减粮食和大豆的播种面积，同时因为土地少，不能进行合理轮作，反而会影响甜菜产量和质量的提高。如1953年甜菜每公顷产量为二万四千斤左右，含糖率平均占14.3％；到1955年每公顷甜菜产量就降低到一万八千斤，含糖率平均只达到11.4％，像这样发展下去，就会影响国家制糖工业的发展。
    去年冬天，吉林省实现了农业高级合作化以后，制订了全省农业生产发展规划。根据这个规划，打算逐步将中部产粮县分的甜菜生产，转移到西部的白城专区去，使甜菜不和粮食争地，从而保证粮食的生产和甜菜的供应。这并不是主观上的空想。省农业厅曾多次派工作组到白城专区调查当地的土质和自然状况，以及过去当地同类作物的生育情况，并且同邻地甜菜丰产的内蒙古自治区的自然条件做了对比。调查材料证明，白城地区如果能做好抗旱保苗工作，不但可以大量播种甜菜，而且可以出产含糖率很高的甜菜。
    在播种以前，吉林省农业厅又派出大批技术人员和农业社主任到内蒙古自治区学习了甜菜丰产经验。播种期间，吉林省农业厅还由内蒙古自治区请了四十八名有经验的农民前来亲自指导。
    辛勤的工作有了令人满意的结果——在这从来没有种过甜菜的风砂地带，获得了大面积的甜菜丰产，给白城地区的农业生产开辟了新的门路。
    白城专区今年的甜菜收获面积为一万二千零五十七公顷，实产量可达到十四万五千多吨，占全省实产量的二分之一左右。这不仅有力地支援了糖厂的生产，也大大增加了白城地区农民的收入。过去白城专区种旱田时，每公顷地只打四、五石粮食，收入仅在一百二十元左右；今年种甜菜每公顷收入就达四百元左右。同时，还收获了许多甜菜叶子，增加了大量的牲畜饲料。
    白城地区能够种甜菜，同时也就使吉林省中部地区粮食作物，特别是大豆的播种面积有了保证。今年，吉林省在大力开发水稻的情况下，仍然超额完成了全省九十五万多公顷地的大豆播种面积，并获得了丰收。全省大豆实产量达到一百零九万多吨。
    为了进一步发挥白城专区的土地潜在力量，吉林省有关领导部门计划在今年已有的基础上，明年把这个专区的甜菜种植面积发展到一万八千多公顷。
