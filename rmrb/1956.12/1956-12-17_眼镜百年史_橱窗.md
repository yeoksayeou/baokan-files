Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 15th. The state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Department Store, whose main business is selling clocks and watches, has set up a window display along the street yesterday showcasing nearly a century of Chinese eyeglasses history. This novel store window has attracted many pedestrians.

The various eyeglasses displayed in the window, ranging from twenty or thirty years ago to a hundred years ago, were all made by Chinese eyeglass workers. A type of eyeglasses popular a hundred years ago had no temples, and the area of the frames was larger than a modern teacup. The eyeglasses popular thirty years ago were as small as copper coins, some round and some oval. The eyeglass case from eighty years ago was an embroidered purse with tassels, and the handwork was very exquisite. The objects in this window also show that China was already using tortoiseshell to make eyeglass frames a hundred years ago.

According to the staff who arranged this window, the history of manufacturing and using eyeglasses in China is much earlier than that, and what is displayed is only a part of what has been collected.

    “眼镜百年史”橱窗
    新华社上海15日电　以出售钟表眼镜为主要业务的国营上海市第三百货商店，昨天起沿街布置了一个中国近百年眼镜史的橱窗。这个新颖的商店橱窗吸引了许多行人。
    橱窗中陈列的二三十年前到百年前的各种眼镜，都是我国眼镜工人制造的。百年前流行的一种眼镜还没有镜脚，镜框面积大过现代的茶杯口。三十年前流行的眼镜却小得像铜钱，有圆形的也有蛋形的，八十年前的镜盒，是一只垂着流苏的绣花荷包，手工十分精致。这个橱窗中的实物还表明，我国在百年前就用玳瑁做镜架了。
    据布置这个橱窗的职工说，我国制造和使用眼镜的历史还要早得多，陈列出来的仅仅是已收集到的一部分。
