Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 24th: The delegation of the National People's Congress of China and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, accompanied by Ke Bonian, the Chinese Ambassador to Romania, visited the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly on the 23rd.

Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly, received the delegation. Vice-Chairman of the Presidium, Sadoveanu Mujik, Secretary Bunaciu, and members of the Presidium also received the delegation.

The reception was filled with a friendly and pleasant atmosphere. Chairman Gheorghiu-Dej, who was ill and had not fully recovered, sat closely with head of delegation Peng Zhen. This was the first time he had received guests after his serious illness.

Gheorghiu-Dej said that he sincerely welcomed the representatives of the great country. He repeatedly expressed the hope that everyone would feel at home in Romania and have a good and enjoyable time. He said: "We should not only have personal acquaintance, but also understand each other. This understanding can strengthen the friendship and peace forces led by the Soviet Union." Gheorghiu-Dej had visited China at the invitation of Chairman Mao Zedong. He said that he often remembered the warm reception he and his delegation received from Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese government, and he often thought of some of the comrades he met in China. Gheorghiu-Dej had so much to say, as if he was meeting relatives he hadn’t seen for a long time, and his conversation exceeded the time his doctor allowed him to receive guests.

At this time, Peng Zhen said: "I propose that Chairman Gheorghiu-Dej give me the floor." Peng Zhen first conveyed greetings from Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Liu Shaoqi to Gheorghiu-Dej, and wished him a speedy recovery. Peng Zhen then thanked Gheorghiu-Dej for receiving the delegation during his illness. Peng Zhen then said that Gheorghiu-Dej believed that China was a large country and Romania was a small country, but his view was different. He said, "Socialism is great, and Romania is a socialist country; greatness lies in being advanced, and you are an advanced country; greatness lies in safeguarding world peace, and you are a bastion of world peace." Peng Zhen said that China is large, but has been backward for many years due to oppression. Romania has helped China in many ways. China is only seven years old. Romania is already more than ten years old, so Romania is a great country. He also said, of course, he did not think China was insignificant.

Sadoveanu also spoke.

During the reception, Bunaciu took out Gheorghiu-Dej's book "In the Country of 600 Million People" after his visit to China and showed it to everyone. He said that Gheorghiu-Dej would sign the book and give it to the guests as a gift.

At noon, the delegation visited the "Mao Zedong" factory in Bucharest, and in the evening, they watched a Romanian song and dance performance.

    我人民代表大会代表团访罗国民议会主席团
    据新华社布加勒斯特24日电　中国全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团，23日由中国驻罗马尼亚大使柯柏年陪同访问了罗马尼亚国民议会主席团。
    罗马尼亚国民议会主席团主席格罗查接见了代表团。主席团副主席萨多维亚努·穆日克、秘书布纳丘和主席团委员等接待了代表团。
    接见时充满了友好愉快的气氛。患病尚未完全康复的格罗查主席同彭真团长紧紧坐在一起，这是他患重病以后第一次接见客人。
    格罗查说，他衷心地欢迎伟大国家的代表。他一再提出希望说，愿大家在罗马尼亚像在自己家里一样，过得好，过得愉快。他说：“我们不仅应该有个人的认识，而且还应当互相了解，这种了解能够加强以苏联为首的友谊和和平力量。”格罗查曾经应毛泽东主席的邀请到中国访问过。他说，他常记起毛泽东主席和中国政府对他们的热情招待，他经常想起在中国认识的一些同志。格罗查像对久别重逢的亲人一样，有说不完的话，他的谈话超过了医生准许他会客的时间。
    这时，彭真说：“我提议格罗查主席把发言权让给我。”彭真首先代表毛泽东主席和刘少奇委员长向格罗查问候，并且祝他早日恢复健康。彭真接着感谢格罗查在病中接见代表团。彭真随后说，格罗查认为中国是大国、罗马尼亚是小国，但是他的看法不同，他说，“社会主义是伟大的，罗马尼亚是社会主义国家；伟大的是先进，你们是先进的国家；伟大的是维护世界和平，你们是世界和平的堡垒。”彭真说，中国国大，但多年来因为受压迫而落后了，罗马尼亚在很多方面帮助了中国。中国才只有七岁。罗马尼亚已经有十多岁了，所以罗马尼亚是大国。他又说，当然他不认为中国是渺小的。
    萨多维亚努也讲了话。
    在接见的时候，布纳丘拿出了格罗查访问中国后的著作“在六亿人口的国家”给大家看，他说，格罗查将在书上签名赠送给客人。
    中午，代表团参观了布加勒斯特的“毛泽东”工厂，晚间，观看了罗马尼亚的歌舞表演。
