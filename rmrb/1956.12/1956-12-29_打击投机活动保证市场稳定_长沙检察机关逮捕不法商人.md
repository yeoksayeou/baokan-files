Xinhua News Agency, Changsha – Changsha City has discovered that a very small number of unscrupulous merchants have organized small groups to purchase state-controlled iron nails and wire in bulk, thereby manipulating the market and seeking exorbitant profits. After a detailed investigation by the Changsha Municipal People's Procuratorate, Xu Zhaokui and Xiao Guifu, whose criminal behavior was the most serious, have been arrested in accordance with the law, and a public prosecution will soon be filed with the Changsha Municipal People's Court.

Although Changsha has implemented the full industry-wide public-private partnership, there are still a few merchants who have not been reformed. Since September of this year, the supply and demand of iron nails and wire in the Changsha market has been tight. At this time, some unscrupulous merchants in Changsha colluded with each other and formed groups, sending people to Yueyang, Hengyang, Chenxian, Changde, Liling, and Liuyang areas of Hunan Province to purchase iron nails and wire in large quantities. Some unscrupulous merchants impersonated employees of the Changsha Handicraft Industry Federation, or the Changsha Mirror Industry Production Cooperative, and other basic construction units to purchase from state-owned companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, or public-private joint venture stores in the aforementioned areas. Some colluded with local small vendors to purchase everywhere. Some even stole state economic intelligence, and after finding out the time when the Hunan Provincial Company of China Hardware and Machinery Company would release iron nails and wire, they tracked down the destination of the goods and bought back the goods that had been transferred. When the iron nails and wire in these places were almost completely bought out by them, they went to Guangxi, Jiangxi, Henan, Zhejiang and other provinces to continue buying in bulk. After the unscrupulous merchants transported the goods they bought in bulk to Changsha, they sold them at prices much higher than the state-owned brand prices. For example, the state-owned wholesale price of two-inch iron nails was 66 yuan per hundred catties, while the black market price sold by these private merchants was as high as 120 yuan. In the fourth quarter of this year, up to December 7, the black market transactions of iron nails and wire in Changsha City reached more than 118 tons. Through these activities, unscrupulous merchants extracted huge illegal profits, causing great losses to the state; at the same time, some members of public-private joint venture stores and cooperative stores with lower awareness were tempted by this illegal profiteering and wanted to withdraw from the joint venture or cooperative organization to engage in speculative business, which adversely affected the state's socialist transformation of private commerce.

Xu Zhaokui has consistently disobeyed state market management in the past, and has long colluded with Xiao Guifu to illegally operate state-controlled materials and evade state taxes. Since September of this year, Xu, Xiao and Xie Pinggui and other eleven people have pooled more than 30,000 yuan of working capital to illegally operate iron nails and wire. When the Changsha Municipal State-owned Commercial Bureau stipulated on December 4 that merchants dealing in iron nails and wire should register their inventory, Xu Zhaokui, Xiao Guifu and others resisted registration.

    打击投机活动保证市场稳定
    长沙检察机关逮捕不法商人
    新华社长沙讯　长沙市发现有极少数不法商人竟组织小集团套购国家统一掌握的铁钉和铅丝，从而操纵市场，牟取暴利。经长沙市人民检察院详细侦查后，已依法将其中犯罪行为最严重的徐兆魁、萧桂福逮捕，并且即将向长沙市人民法院提起公诉。
    长沙虽然已经实行全行业公私合营，但是还有少数商人没有进行改造。从今年9月份以来，长沙市场上曾出现铁钉和铅丝供求紧张的情况，就在这个时候，长沙市有一些不法商人先后勾结起来，结成集团，派人到湖南省岳阳、衡阳、郴县、常德、醴陵、浏阳一带大肆套购铁钉和铅丝，有的不法商人冒充长沙市手工业联社、或者冒充长沙市镜业生产合作社和其他基本建设单位的工作人员，向上述地区的国营公司、供销社或公私合营商店购买，有的串通当地小商贩四处收购。甚至还有的窃取了国家经济情报，在打听到中国五金机械公司湖南省公司铁钉、铅丝下放的时间以后，便跟踪到调货终点地区，把调下去的商品又套购回来。当上述这些地方的铁钉、铅丝几乎被他们套购一空的时候，他们又到广西、江西、河南、浙江等省继续进行套购。不法商人把套购的商品运来长沙以后，便以比国营牌价高得多的价格出售。如二寸铁钉，国营批发价为每百斤六十六元，而这些私商所出售的黑市价格竟高达一百二十元。今年第四季度截至12月7日止，长沙市铁钉、铅丝的黑市交易竟达一百一十八吨多。通过这些活动，不法商人从中攫取了巨额非法利润，使国家蒙受了很大的损失；同时使一些觉悟较低的公私合营商店成员和合作商店成员，为这种非法的暴利所诱惑，也想退出合营或合作组织去做投机买卖，使国家对私营商业的社会主义改造工作受到不利的影响。
    徐兆魁过去一贯不服从国家市场管理，长期与萧桂福勾结一起，非法经营国家统一掌握的物资，偷漏国家税收。今年9月份以来，徐、萧两人和谢平桂等十一人，拼凑流动资金三万多元，非法经营铁钉、铅丝。12月4日长沙市国营商业局规定经营铁钉、铅丝的商贩实行存货登记时，徐兆魁、萧桂福等竟抗拒登记。
