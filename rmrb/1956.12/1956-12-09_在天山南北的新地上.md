On the New Land North and South of the Tianshan Mountains

The Agricultural Output Value of the Production and Construction Corps Increased by 70% Compared with Last Year

　　The agricultural production units of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, on thirty-one farms located north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, have generally achieved increased production of most crops this year, with the total agricultural output value increasing by more than 70% compared to last year. This year, the agricultural production units harvested over 1.6 million mu, yielding a total of 207.46 million jin of grain and over 66.4 million jin of cotton (seed cotton). The yields of all major crops have increased compared to last year, especially corn and oilseed crops. The total corn yield of the corps, covering over 280,000 mu, averaged more than 298 jin per mu, an increase of 28.6% compared to last year, with over 15,000 mu achieving an average yield of over 1,000 jin. Over 270,000 mu of winter wheat achieved an average yield of 203 jin. Although over 359,000 mu of cotton suffered significant natural disasters this year, the average yield still reached more than 180 jin (seed cotton), with over 18,700 mu still achieving an average yield of over 400 jin. Over 76,000 mu of oilseed crops achieved an average yield of 104 jin, an increase of 42% compared to last year. This year, many high-yield records have also emerged on various farms. In the Manas River Reclamation Area, the highest cotton yield of three cotton planting teams reached over 1,300 jin. Among them, the 3.84 mu high-yield land of the Xue Zhanchun team of Anjihai Farm averaged 1,686.46 jin per mu, creating the highest cotton yield record in the country.

More and More Barren Land is Being Transformed into Fertile Fields

　　This year, the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has reclaimed over 600,000 mu of barren land in the Manas River Basin of the Junggar Basin. To date, the reclaimed and cultivated land in this Manas River Basin reclamation area, known for its cotton production, has been expanded to over 1.4 million mu.

　　For several months, the sky over the Manas River Basin reclamation area has been filled with the smoke of burning off the wilderness. In November, although the night temperature dropped below 0 degrees Celsius and the ground began to freeze, the huge land reclamation tractors were still roaring day and night. Currently, there are fifteen newly built, expanded, and renovated farms in Shihezi, Wula Usu, Pao Tai, Che Pai Zi, Xia Ye Di, Liu Gou, and other places. The country's largest Anjihai Cotton Planting Farm, with over 300,000 mu of cultivated land, is also located in this area. The seven rivers and some streams distributed in the Manas River Basin are gradually being controlled by the soldiers engaged in water conservancy construction. After building canals such as the Manas River West Bank Canal, they continued to build large-scale water conservancy projects such as the Bayingou Water Diversion Canal and the Liugou Irrigation Area this year, diverting river water to the fields of the farms. The production units have also built five reservoirs successively. After all these reservoirs are completed, they can retain hundreds of millions of cubic meters of floodwater, allowing hundreds of thousands of mu of land to receive sufficient irrigation even during the dry season of the rivers.

The Largest Cotton Planting Farm in the Country

　　The construction of China's largest cotton planting farm, the Anjihai Farm in the Manas River Basin of Xinjiang, has initially taken shape. The area of newly reclaimed land that has been put into production and is preparing for production conditions is nearly 100,000 mu. The first batch of soldiers and workers of the Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production and Construction Corps, who are responsible for the production tasks of this farm, have recently moved into the farm's new residences.

　　More than half a year ago, the stone-filled water diversion canals, the main canal stretching twenty kilometers, and the crisscrossing irrigation channels were mostly just lines on the farm's construction design blueprint. Now, the clear river water from the Bayingou River at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, diverted by the water diversion canals, flows smoothly through the main and branch canals to the residential areas and fields. Not long ago, places piled with building materials such as cobblestones, timber, and cement have now seen various buildings, including more than one hundred control gates and bridges.

　　Six months ago, the Anjihai wilderness was filled with clusters of wild trees, and the endless reeds often caused people who entered it to lose their way. Now, the main road running through the center of the farm from south to north can lead people to various work areas. In the work areas, more than 120,000 mu of barren land has been reclaimed by giant tractors, of which more than 20,000 mu have grown green wheat seedlings. Some of the remaining reclaimed land is being flushed with water to wash away salt and alkali, and some is being leveled in preparation for production next year. The work of reclaiming new barren land is also underway simultaneously.

　　A batch of white-painted houses still smelling of paint has been built in the areas of the general farm headquarters and five work stations in the center of the farm. The area of these buildings is more than 24,000 square meters, including offices, tractor rooms, staff dormitories, canteens, and family residences. In addition, the business outlets of the People's Bank of China and the Post Office, the cooperative, and the Xinhua Bookstore are also being built near the general farm headquarters. In the orchard newly opened near the general farm headquarters, covering more than 500 mu, more than 3,000 fruit tree seedlings have been planted. In the past, wolves and foxes often visited the area, but now people can safely raise Ukrainian white pigs and flocks of chickens.

　　The farm's leadership is beginning to discuss and draft next year's production plan in the newly built offices. They tentatively plan to plant about 130,000 mu of crops such as cotton, grain, and fodder next year, of which cotton fields will account for more than 42,000 mu. (Xinhua News Agency)

A Large Farm庄

　　A large farm built by the Xinjiang Production Corps for farmers of all ethnic groups in the Anjihai area has been basically completed. Now, ninety-four households of farmers of various ethnic groups such as Uyghur, Kazakh, Han, Hui, and Mongolian have left the thatched houses, tents, and dugout dwellings where they have lived for a long time and moved into new houses in the farm. In the farm, the fields are neatly arranged, the canals are straight, and there are also newly built shelterbelts and 4,780 mu of green winter wheat. Farmers of all ethnic groups are very satisfied with this new farm, and specially held a meeting on October 31 to celebrate the completion of the farm. At the celebration, County Chief Yila Yati, on behalf of the farmers of all ethnic groups in Shawan County, expressed his gratitude to the production units for building the farm, saying: "The troops have built a large farm with more than 74,000 mu of land for farmers of all ethnic groups, leading them to the path of socialist large-scale production. This is a great happy event that farmers of all ethnic groups will never forget."

　　在天山南北的新地上
　　生产建设兵团农业总产值比去年增加70％
    新疆生产建设兵团农业生产部队在天山南北的三十一个农场，今年大部分作物普遍增产，农业总产值比去年增长70％以上。今年农业生产部队的收获面积，共有一百六十余万亩，共收获粮食二亿零七百四十六万斤，收获棉花六千六百四十多万斤（籽棉）各种主要作物产量都比去年提高，特别是玉米和油料作物。全兵团二十八万余亩玉米产量，平均每亩达到二百九十八斤多，比去年提高了28.6％，有一万五千多亩平均产量达到一千斤以上。二十七万多亩冬麦，平均产量达到二百零三斤。三十五万九千多亩棉花，今年虽遭受很大的自然灾害，但平均产量仍然达到一百八十多斤（籽棉），其中有一万八千七百多亩平均产量仍然达到四百斤以上。油料作物七万六千多亩，平均产量达到一百零四斤，比去年提高42％。今年各农场还出现了许多高额丰产纪录。玛纳斯河垦区有三个植棉小组的棉花最高产量达到一千三百斤以上，其中安集海农场薛占春小组的三点八四亩高额丰产地，平均每亩达到一千六百八十六点四六斤，创造了全国棉花产量的最高纪录。

　　越来越多的荒土变成了良田
    中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队今年已经在准噶尔盆地的玛纳斯河流域开垦出六十多万亩荒地。至此，这个以产棉著名的玛纳斯河流域垦区，被开垦和种植的土地已经扩大到一百四十多万亩。
    几个月来，玛纳斯河流域垦区的上空一直弥漫着烧荒的烟雾。11月间，虽然夜间气温降低到摄氏零度以下，地面开始结冻，但是巨大的开荒拖拉机仍然在日夜轰鸣。目前在石河子、乌拉乌苏、炮台、车排子、下野地、柳沟等地，新建、扩建和改建的农场已经有十五个。全国最大的拥有三十多万亩耕地的安集海植棉农场，也在这个地区。分布在玛纳斯河流域的七条河流和一些溪流，逐渐为从事水利建设的战士们所控制。他们在建成了玛纳斯河西岸大渠等渠道以后，今年又继续建成了浆砌卵石的八音沟引水渠、柳沟灌区等大型水利工程，把河水引到农场的田野上。生产部队还先后修筑五个水库，这些水库全部建成以后，可以拦蓄洪水一亿几千万立方公尺，将使几十万亩土地在河流枯水期间也能够得到充足的灌溉。　（新华社）
　　全国最大的植棉农场
    我国最大的植棉农场——新疆玛纳斯河流域安集海农场，建场工作已经初具规模，现在投入生产和正在准备生产条件的新开垦土地面积将近有十万亩。新疆军区农业生产建设部队担负这个农场生产任务的第一批战士和职工，最近搬进了农场新居。
    半年多以前，农场中用卵石浆砌的引水渠和长达二十公里的总干渠，以及纵横分布的灌溉渠道，大部分还只是建场设计蓝图上面的一些线条。如今引水渠引来的天山脚下八音沟河的清澈的河水，顺畅地通过总干渠和支渠，流向居住区和田野。不久以前还堆积着卵石、木料和水泥等建筑材料的地方，现在出现了各种建筑物，包括一百多座节制闸和桥梁等。
    在半年前的安集海荒原上，到处是一簇簇的野生树木，望不到边的芦苇丛常常使进入其中的人迷失方向。现在，由南而北穿过农场中心地的主干道，可以把人们引向各个作业区。在作业区里，已经有十二万多亩荒地由巨型拖拉机开垦出来，其中两万多亩长出了青绿色的麦苗。其余已经开垦的土地，有的正在放水冲刷盐碱，有的正在平整地面，准备明年投入生产。开垦新荒地的工作，也在同时进行。
  一批粉饰成白色的还在散发着油漆气味的房舍，已经在农场中心的总场部和五个作业站的地区内建设起来。这批建筑物的面积共有两万四千多平方公尺，其中有办公室、拖拉机房、职工宿舍、食堂和家属住宅等。此外，人民银行和邮局的营业所、合作社和新华书店的门市部，也正在总场部附近建设中。在总场部附近新开辟的占地五百多亩的果园，栽植了三千多株果树苗。过去狼和狐狸常去的地方，现在人们可以放心地喂养乌克兰种白猪和鸡群。
    农场领导部门在新建的办公室里，开始讨论和草拟明年的生产计划。他们初步计划明年种植棉花、谷物和饲料等作物十三万亩左右，其中棉田占四万二千多亩。

　  一个大型的农庄
    新疆生产兵团在安集海地区为各族农民兴建的一个大型农庄已基本建成。现在有九十四户维、哈、汉、回、蒙古等族农民，离开了他们长期居住过的草房、帐篷和地窝子，搬入农庄的新房。农庄里条田整齐，渠道笔直，还有新营造的防护林和四千七百八十亩绿油油的冬麦。各族农民对这个新农庄非常满意，特地在10月31日集会庆祝农庄的建成。在庆祝会上，伊拉也提县长代表沙湾县各族农民向建设农庄的生产部队表示谢意，他说：“部队为各族农民建设了一个拥有七万四千多亩地的大农庄，把各族农民引向社会主义大生产的途径，这是各族农民永远不能忘记的一件大喜事。”
