Xinhua News Agency dispatch: In mid-December, snowflakes fluttered for several days over the construction site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex. The wind and snow attacked the construction site, but the builders overcame the severe cold.

In the factory that prefabricates various concrete components for the construction site, a dense network of steam pipes uses hot steam to control the vast open-air prefabrication yard and eighteen prefabrication kilns. Hot steam is injected here from morning to night, and milky white steam rises steadily all day long through the thick canvas covering the prefabricated products. The prefabrication time for each batch of concrete components here is shortened by one and a half to two days compared to summer.

Steam pipes also run to the water tanks on top of the towering concrete mixing building. Here, concrete mixed with warm water is sent to various construction sites. Whenever the funnel at the bottom of the mixing building opens automatically, steaming concrete pours down; even at the construction site farthest from here, the temperature of the concrete can be maintained above 10 degrees Celsius when it arrives.

At various construction sites, the builders spread anti-slip straw mats on the roads and scaffolding covered with thin ice, and wrapped the water pipes with straw. On the 17th, despite the snow, the builders began continuously pouring concrete at the overpass construction site on the factory's western railway line. After pouring each layer, they covered it with oilcloth and sawdust to continue pouring. They said that the severe cold cannot stop our enthusiasm.

In this freezing winter, the bulldozer and excavator operators are the first to greet the dawn on the construction site every day. The bulldozer operators get up at four o'clock in the morning. They wipe away the frozen ice flowers on the windows, push away the thin layer of snow or frost, and drive the bulldozers, rumbling and combing the future factory foundation. To ensure that the excavators can be started on time at seven o'clock the next morning, people are on duty all night, braving the biting cold wind to guard the excavators, taking turns starting the engine every now and then.

    武钢的建设者战胜了严寒
    据新华社讯　12月中旬，武汉钢铁联合企业的建筑工地上一连几天飘着雪花。风雪袭击着工地，但是建设者战胜了严寒。
    为工地预制各种混凝土构件的工厂里，密布的蒸汽管道用热蒸汽控制着广阔的露天预制场和十八个预制窑，这里从早到晚有热蒸汽注入，乳白色的蒸汽透过复盖在预制品上的厚帆布，终日袅袅上升。这里每一批混凝土构件的预制时间比夏天缩短一天半到两天。
    蒸汽管道还通到高耸的混凝土搅拌楼顶的水箱里。这里，用温水搅拌的混凝土被送到各施工现场。每当搅拌楼底的漏斗自动开起，冒着热气的混凝土便倾泻下来；哪怕是离这里最远的工地，混凝土送到现场的时候，温度也能保持在摄氏十度以上。
    在各施工现场，建设者们在结着薄冰的道路上和脚手架上，铺上了防滑的草垫，用稻草包好了给水管。17日上午，建筑者们冒着雪，在厂西铁路线跨线桥工地，开始连续浇灌混凝土，他们每浇灌一层，又用油布和锯沫等复盖起来继续浇灌。他们说，严寒挡不住我们的热情。
    在这严寒的冬季，工地上每天最先迎接黎明的是铲运机手和挖土机手。清晨四点多钟，铲运机手们就起床了。他们抹去车窗上的凝结的冰花，推去薄薄的积雪或霜冻，驾驶着铲运机，隆隆作响地梳理着未来的厂基。挖土机手们为在次日清早七时能够按时开动挖土机，彻夜有人冒着刺骨的寒风守候着挖土机，每隔一会就轮番发动一次引擎。
