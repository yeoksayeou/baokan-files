　　The Lives of Japanese Coal Miners
　　Lan Hai
　　There are currently 753 coal mines operating in Japan. Twelve large coal mining companies control 88.5% of the country's coal reserves. Of the 700-plus coal mines, only 80 are directly managed by these twelve large companies; the rest, either mined-out or with poor coal quality, are leased to small and medium-sized enterprises at high rents. The country's coal mines produce 30 to 40 million tons of coal per month, of which more than two-thirds are produced by large company mines, and only about one-third by the more than 600 small and medium-sized mines.

　　After the war, the number of Japanese coal miners reached 420,000. In 1949, the United States forced the Japanese government to implement the "Dodge Line" plan, concentrating government funds in the large, monopolistic coal mines, which led to the closure of 209 small and medium-sized mines and the unemployment of 70,000 miners. During the economic crisis following the Korean War, the Japanese authorities implemented the so-called "rationalization" policy, which forced another 100,000 miners out of the mines. From September 1955, the Japanese government began implementing a five-year plan called the "Coal Mining Industry Temporary Measures Law," which is estimated to result in the closure of 280 small and medium-sized mines and the unemployment of 57,000 miners.

　　In Japan, coal miners have always been impoverished farmers, urban poor, or criminals being pursued by the police. They have always received very low wages and lived extremely miserable lives. Even now, although some coal mines have adopted mechanized production, the lives of the miners have not improved, but have become even more difficult.

　　"A wooden sword if you show discontent, white headscarves stained with blood." This old folk song describing the lives of miners is not an exaggeration at all. In the past, Japanese coal miners were confined to prison-like huts, forced to work twelve hours a day underground. Anyone who resisted or tried to escape would be caught by the capitalists' lackeys and beaten with wooden swords, beaten half to death if not killed. After the war, the wooden swords were gone, but they were replaced by the American management methods, which use stopwatches and conveyor belts as whips to increase labor productivity. Although the workers won an eight-hour working day through their own efforts, the capitalists forced the miners to produce more coal than they did in twelve hours. Driven by stopwatches and conveyor belts, the miners had to dig large amounts of coal, so the haulers, sorters, and timbermen also became strained. The work that used to be done by eight miners is now done by only five. Because the monopoly enterprises implemented a "hurry-up system," the small and medium-sized coal mines that had not implemented mechanization also demanded the same productivity, so the labor intensity in these mining areas was even higher.

　　The capitalists also used piece-rate wages and quota wages to cleverly exploit the miners. Miners underground receive piece-rate wages; if production is low, the wages are so meager that they cannot even afford to eat. At the same time, mine supervisors deliberately report more waste coal during coal quality inspections, reducing the workers' production volume, and their wages naturally decrease. Haulers receive fixed wages, and no matter how much the coal production increases, no matter how much the labor intensity increases, their wages will not increase. The wages of miners working outside the mine are half as much as the wages of workers in other machine factories doing the same work. The wages of miners in small and medium-sized coal mines are only half of those in large coal mines, and often some coal mines withhold wages for long periods of time, and then go bankrupt, leaving the workers with nothing.

　　The lives of Japanese coal miners have become increasingly difficult since the war. An old miner who has worked for thirty years said: "Compared to digging coal by hand in the past, the work is now more tiring. In the past, one person working could somehow support a family. Now, even if the wife and children work together, life is still harder than before."

　　At the Japan Mothers' Congress, a housewife from a small coal mining area in Kitakyushu tearfully described the following situation:

　　An unemployed miner went to work as a temporary worker. When he was returning home in the evening, he met a woman about the same age as his mother who greeted him and said, "Please buy it, fifty yen." The unemployed miner did not know what this miner's family member wanted him to buy, so he asked her. Only then did he learn that the woman was forced to sell her body because her family had no rice to cook for dinner that night. The young unemployed worker was very distressed and gave her fifty yen, asking her to buy some coarse grains. The woman was so moved that she put her palms together and thanked him.

　　It is said that most of the girls sold to brothels near the US military base in Kitakyushu are the daughters of miners who are struggling on the edge of starvation.

　　The mechanization implemented by the monopoly capitalists within the enterprises is only for their profits, and they are unwilling to spend any money on ensuring worker safety. "Don't let girls marry miners, the coal will collapse and turn them into widows." The tragic scenes of gas explosions and coal mine collapses reflected in the old folk songs have not decreased, but have even increased, even with the adoption of American production methods. Now, as in the past, every coal mine entrance has a spirit tablet of the mountain god. Before going down the mine, the miners bow to the mountain god, begging him to protect them for a day of peace. According to news reports, major injury and death accidents have occurred continuously in the coal mines of large monopoly capitalists such as Pacific, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo in the past two years, costing the lives of hundreds of miners.

　　"If our ideals can be realized, let those chimneys emit our hope." For a long time, just as this folk song said, the Japanese miners who had endured suffering suddenly stood up in the ruins of World War II. In October 1945, miners in various places, led by the Mitsui Ashibetsu Coal Mine, successively established trade unions. In January 1947, a national coal miners' union organization was finally established.

　　The miners did not succumb to the constant oppression and interference of the American occupation forces and the Japanese government. They put forward demands such as increasing wages, improving working conditions, and opposing layoffs, and carried out countless strikes. From October to December 1952, the coal miners bravely carried out a general strike for more than sixty consecutive days, fully demonstrating the fighting strength of the coal miners. In the 1956 spring joint struggle of Japanese workers, the coal miners defeated the repressive measures taken by the capitalists to close down the national mines and achieved victory. In these struggles, the miners' families formed a "Coal Mine Housewives' Council" consisting of 110,000 people. They united together and did not succumb to hunger and repression, supporting the miners in carrying out a long-term struggle.

　　The Japanese miners know that to protect their lives and safety, they must first break away from American rule and transform Japan's war economy into a peaceful economy. Therefore, the coal miners' union firmly opposes the "increased productivity" movement under American control, and stands heroically at the forefront of the struggle to defend independence and peace, together with the national working class.

　　日本煤矿工人的生活
　　蓝海
    现在日本全国有七百五十三处煤矿开工生产。十二家大煤矿公司掌握着全国煤炭埋藏量的88.5％。在七百多处煤矿中，只有八十个矿区是直接由这十二个大公司经营的，其他挖坏了的或煤质不好的煤矿，都以高额租金租给中小企业经营。全国煤矿每月出产三千万吨到四千万吨的煤，其中的三分之二以上是大公司的煤矿生产出来的，只有约三分之一是六百多个中小煤矿生产的。
    战后日本煤矿工人的人数曾达到四十二万人。1949年美国迫使日本政府实施“道奇方案”，把政府的资金集中在垄断资本的大煤矿里，引起了二百零九家中小煤矿倒闭，七万矿工失业。在朝鲜战争结束后所发生的经济危机中，日本当局又实施所谓“合理化”政策，使十万矿工被赶出了矿场。从1955年9月起，日本政府又开始实施所谓“煤矿工业临时措施法”的五年计划，估计将有二百八十家中小煤矿倒闭，五万七千矿工失业。
    在日本，当煤矿工人的一向就是饥寒交迫的农民，或是城市里的贫民，再不就是被警察追捕的犯人。他们一向只能得到很低的工资，过着极悲惨的生活。直到现在，有些煤矿虽然采用了机械化生产，但是矿工的生活并没有改善，反而更加艰苦了。
    “一流露不满就要挨木刀，鲜血染红了白头巾”。这支古老的描写矿工生活的民谣，一点也没有夸张。从前日本的煤矿工人是被关在像监狱一样的小屋里，每天被迫下井干十二小时的苦工。谁要有一点儿反抗或是企图逃跑，就会被资本家的狗腿子抓去用木刀殴打，不打死也要打得半死不活。战后，木刀已经没有了，但是代之而来的是美国的经营管理方式，它是用记秒表和传送带形成的一条用来提高劳动生产率的皮鞭。虽然工人们用自己的力量争得了八小时劳动制，可是资本家迫使矿工们生产出比十二小时还挖得多的煤炭。被记秒表和传送带追迫下的矿工们，必须挖出大量的煤炭，因此运搬工、选炭工和坑木工也就跟着紧张起来。过去八个矿工作的活，现在只由五个人来作。由于垄断企业实行了“赶快制度”，没有实行机械化的中小煤矿也就跟着要求具有同样的生产率，因此在这些矿区的劳动强度更高。
    资本家还利用计件工资和定额工资的两种方式对矿工们进行着巧妙的剥削。矿井下的矿工们由于是计件工资，产量不高的，工资就少得连饭都吃不饱。同时，由于矿场监督在检查煤炭质量时故意多报废炭，减少了工人们的生产量，工资自然也就少了。运搬工人拿定额工资，无论煤的产量增加多少，无论劳动强度增加了多少，他们的工资也不会增加。在矿井外工作的矿工的工资，比起做着同样工作的其他机器工厂的工人的工资来要少一半。中小煤矿的矿工的工资也只有大煤矿的一半，并且常常有些煤矿长期扣发工资，最后倒闭了，工人一个钱也拿不到。
    战后日本煤矿工人生活越来越艰苦了。一个工作了三十年的老矿工说：“和以前用手挖煤比起来，现在的工作更累了。以前一个人出来工作，多少还能维持一家的生活。现在连老婆带孩子一齐出来工作，可是生活过得比以前更苦。”
    在日本母亲大会上，一个从北九州的小煤矿区来的矿工家庭主妇流着泪叙述了下面的情况：
    有一个失业矿工去当临时工，傍晚回家的时候，遇到一个同他的母亲年龄相仿佛的妇女向他招呼说：“请买吧，五十块钱。”失业矿工由于不知道这个矿工家属要他买什么，就向她询问了一下，才知道这个妇女因为当晚家里没有米做饭，被迫只得出卖她的肉体。这个年轻的失业工人非常痛心，就送给她五十圆，要她去买些粗粮。那个妇女当时感动得向他合掌道谢。
    据说卖给北九州美国军事基地附近妓院的女孩子们，多半就是这些挣扎在饥饿线上的矿工的女儿。
    垄断资本家在企业内所实行的械机化只是为了他们的利润，对于保障工人安全方面是一个钱也舍不得花的。“别让姑娘嫁给矿工哪，煤方坍下来就变成了寡妇”。在古老民谣里所反映出来的瓦斯爆炸和煤矿坍塌的悲惨情景，直到采用了美国生产方式的现在，不但没有减少，甚至反而增多了。现在每处煤矿的井口前，都和以往一样供奉着山神的灵牌。矿工们在下井以前都向山神鞠躬，乞求山神保佑他们一日平安。据报纸上的消息，在太平洋、三井、三菱、住友等大垄断资本的煤矿里，两年来不断发生重大伤亡事故，几百名矿工丧失了生命。
      “如果我们的理想能够实现，就让那些烟筒冒出我们的希望来”。长时期以来就像这支民谣所说的那样，忍受着苦痛的日本矿工们在第二次世界大战的废墟中猛然地站起来了。1945年10月，各地矿工在三井芦别煤矿带头下相继成立了工会，1947年1月终于建立了一个全国性的煤矿工会组织。
    矿工们在美国占领军和日本政府的不断压迫和干涉之下，丝毫没有屈服。他们提出了增加工资、改善劳动条件、反对解雇等要求，并且不断进行了无数次的罢工斗争。1952年10月到12月之间，煤矿工人英勇地进行了连续六十多天的总罢工，充分显示了煤矿工人的斗争力量。在1956年春季日本工人的联合斗争中，煤矿工人击败了资本家所采取的封闭全国矿场的镇压手段，取得了胜利。在这些斗争中，矿工家属们成立了包括十一万人的
  “煤矿主妇协议会”，她们联合在一起不向饥饿和镇压屈服，支持了矿工进行长期斗争。
    日本的矿工们知道，要保卫生活和安全，首先必须脱离美国的统治，把日本的战争经济转变为和平经济。因此，煤矿工会向坚决反对在美国支配下的“提高生产力”运动，和全国工人阶级在一起，英勇地站在保卫独立和和平的斗争的最前列。（附图片）
