　　The City's Snow is Singing
　　Zou Difan

Oh, the city's snow is singing, singing warm songs, singing songs of peace. No, the feather-like snow falls silently, it is the city singing on a snowy day. Trams and cars drive by wearing snow helmets, people are singing with their work. Go, let the machines pour out their hearts, let the computers ring like the harvesting of new grain in the fields, let the fountain pens drip ink like spring rain... The city's snow sings warm songs. The factory chimneys are the socialist heating pipes, opening up flowers of smoke; the Health Bureau is broadcasting in a friendly voice: "Prevent colds! Prevent gas poisoning!..." In winter, the snow is falling, the snow is singing! The city's snow sings songs of peace. "Heavy snow falls, but the price of firewood, rice, oil, and salt does not rise," this is the song of department stores, cooperatives, and joint public-private stores; their windows also shine with large slogans: "Support Egypt, oppose Anglo-French aggression!" In winter, the snow is falling, the snow is singing! On snowy nights, oh, the city's nights, the red glow in the sky is the lights of the whole city. I don't need to say how people will rest tonight, how they will work tomorrow; even in this quiet night, the Soviet Circus is performing at the Sun Palace, the Hungarian Cultural Troupe is playing at the Grand Theater, and French films are appearing on our screens... Our city is also singing internationalist songs on leisure nights.

　　都市的雪在唱歌
　　邹荻帆哦，都市的雪在唱歌，唱温暖的歌，唱和平的歌，不，羽毛般的雪无声地下落，是都市在落雪天唱歌。电车、汽车戴着雪盔驶过，人们要用工作去唱歌。去，让机器倾吐肺腑，让计算机响着像田亩上收割新禾，让水笔滴着墨点像春雨般洒落……都市的雪唱着温暖的歌。工厂的烟突是社会主义的暖气管，开放了烟雾的花朵；卫生局用亲切的声音在广播：“预防感冒！防止煤气中毒！……”冬天，雪在洒落，雪在唱歌！都市的雪唱着和平的歌。“大雪纷纷下，柴米油盐不涨价”，这是百货店、合作社、公私合营店的歌；它们橱窗上还亮着大标语：“支持埃及，反对英法侵略！”冬天，雪在洒落，雪在唱歌！落雪夜，都市的夜啊，烘红了天的是满城灯火。我不必说人们今夜将怎样休息，明天将怎样工作；就在这安静的夜里，苏联马戏团在太阳宫表演，匈牙利文工团在大剧院演奏，法兰西电影片出现在我们的银幕……我们的都市在休闲夜也唱着国际主义的歌。
