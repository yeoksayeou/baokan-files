    Self-Funded Trip to the Soviet Union
    First Group Departs from Hangzhou

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) A group of self-funded travelers to the Soviet Union, organized by the Hangzhou branch of China International Travel Service, departed from Hangzhou on the 19th. This is the first group of self-funded travelers abroad organized by China International Travel Service. Registration for the second group trip has already begun.

    The first group of self-funded travelers consists of twenty-five people, including individuals from the Hangzhou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, the Student Union, and business circles. Their itinerary is as follows: after leaving Hangzhou, they will travel to Shanghai and board the first international train from Shanghai to Moscow. After arriving in Moscow, they will spend four days sightseeing, then fly to Stalingrad for two days of sightseeing, and then take a boat along the Lenin Volga-Don Canal for two days. After passing through Rostov, they will transfer to Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, and from Kiev to Leningrad. Finally, they will return to China from Moscow. The round trip will take a total of forty days.

    All procedures, including exit formalities, food, accommodation, and sightseeing, for these self-funded travelers to the Soviet Union are handled by China International Travel Service. The total cost for each traveler is 1,522.44 yuan.

    This year, China International Travel Service and the Soviet International Travel Agency signed a contract for self-funded travel between the people of the two countries to enhance friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Soviet people. According to statistics from the Hangzhou branch of China International Travel Service, there have been thirty-two groups of Soviet people traveling to China at their own expense this year, totaling nearly a thousand people. The members include engineers, workers, collective farm members, professors, writers, journalists, primary and secondary school teachers, doctors, cooks, drivers, nursery workers, and housewives.
