Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 1st: TASS reports from Washington on November 30th: The Egyptian Embassy in Washington has published a compilation of documents titled "Anglo-French-Israeli Aggression Against Egypt." This compilation contains materials and photographic documents about the atrocities committed by the aggressors in Egypt. The compilation includes an article by Swedish journalist Andersson, who witnessed the Anglo-French atrocities in Port Said.

Andersson wrote: "I saw thousands upon thousands of corpses in the ruins and on the grounds of some surviving hospitals. Two hospitals housing nearly nine hundred patients were completely destroyed. In the Gamil district, three hundred and fifty small houses inhabited by poor citizens were reduced to ashes by incendiary bombs dropped by jet fighters and bombers. In the ruins of these wooden houses, I saw hundreds of charred bodies—women and children burned alive. Two large graves were dug in the stadium to bury the bodies of citizens transported from nearby hospitals. According to doctors, in the first few days of the offensive, the number of casualties was three hundred per day. In one place alone, I saw four hundred civilian bodies. British authorities said that the losses suffered by civilians were not great, but according to existing materials, the number of casualties in the city was seven thousand to twelve thousand."

Andersson continued: "I saw how thousands upon thousands of refugees left Port Said in small fishing boats. I saw children with gunshot wounds on their backs. On some bodies, I saw wounds up to seven centimeters in diameter—the result of machine-gun fire. They were shot while fleeing in panic. In one place, two hundred and seventy bodies were transported in two hours. Finally, I was arrested by the British and ordered to go to the paratrooper headquarters to be sent to Cyprus."

Andersson said: "I have been working as a military photojournalist since the Spanish Civil War, but I find it difficult to find any situation to compare with what I saw in Port Said. Planes flew along the streets and strafed civilians with machine guns—can this be called a police action? I say, this is terror and massacre, a shameful stain that the British will never be able to wash away." (Attached pictures)

Swedish photojournalist Andersson entered Port Said two days after the Anglo-French invading forces occupied the city and took many photos of the invaders' brutal massacre of local residents. Reprinted here are two of them. The photo on the right shows the scene of devastation everywhere in Port Said after being狂轰滥炸 (madly bombed) by the invading forces. The picture above shows the miserable situation of an innocent child who has lost his relatives and is wandering in the ruins, crying for food.

　　永远洗不清的罪迹！
　　埃及发表“英法以侵略埃及”文件汇集
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿11月30日讯：埃及驻华盛顿大使馆发表了“英、法、以侵略埃及”文件汇集。这本汇集里收集了关于干涉者在埃及的暴行的材料和照片文件。汇集里有目击英法在塞得港的暴行的瑞典记者安德逊的一篇文章。
    安德逊写道：“我在废墟中和一些残存医院的土地上，看到成千上万的尸体。住着将近九百名病人的两个医院被彻底炸毁。在加米尔区，贫苦市民居住的三百五十间不大的房屋被喷气式战斗机和轰炸机投掷的燃烧弹烧得化为灰烬。在这些木头房子的废墟中，我看到数以百计的烧焦了的尸体——活活烧死的妇女和儿童。体育场上挖掘了两座大坟，以埋葬从附近医院里运出来的公民的尸体。据医生说，在进攻开始的头几天，每天伤亡人数有三百人。单单在一个地方，我就看到四百具市民的尸体。英国当局说，平民所遭受的损失不大，但是，根据现有的材料，市内伤亡的人数有七千到一万二千人。”
    安德逊又说：“我看到，成千上万的难民如何坐着不大的渔船离开塞得港。我看到背部负着枪伤的孩子。在有些尸体身上，我看到直径达七公分的伤口——这是机关枪扫射的结果。他们是在惊慌逃避的时候被射死的。在有一个地方，在两个钟头内就运过了两百七十具尸体。最后，我被英国人逮捕了，我奉命到伞兵总部去，以便送往塞浦路斯。”
    安德逊说：“我从西班牙内战以来一直担任军事摄影记者的工作，但是我很难找到任何情况来同我在塞得港看到的情况相比。飞机沿着大街飞行，用机关枪扫射市民——难道能说这是警察行动吗？我说，这是恐怖和残杀，这种耻辱的污点英国人永远也洗不清的。”（附图片）
    瑞典摄影记者安德逊曾在英法侵略军队占领塞得港后两天进入该城市，拍摄了许多有关侵略者残酷屠杀当地居民的照片。这里转载的是其中的两张，右图是塞得港遭受侵略军队狂轰滥炸后到处一片瓦砾的情景。上图是个失去了亲人的无辜儿童流落在废墟中嗷嗷待哺的惨状。
