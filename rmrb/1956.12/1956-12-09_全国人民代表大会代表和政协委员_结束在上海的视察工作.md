Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 8th. National People's Congress deputies and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) concluded their inspection work in Shanghai on the 7th.

　　Over several weeks, dozens of deputies and members inspected over a hundred grassroots units, carefully understanding and discussing various aspects of work, including free markets, industrial production, and culture and education, and put forward many suggestions for improvement.

　　Deputy Wang Zhixin and others visited several of Shanghai's largest non-staple food markets, where they saw abundant supplies of vegetables, fish, shrimp, chicken, and duck, with citizens freely choosing their purchases. Both buyers and sellers in the market told the deputies about how their lives had improved since the opening of the state-led free market. The deputies also learned about the management of the free markets and made suggestions to relevant departments to strengthen political and ideological education for vendors and to strengthen leadership over the free markets to avoid price gouging or the emergence of black markets.

　　CPPCC member Zhang Deqing and others inspected some Shanghai factories manufacturing auto parts and accessories. Zhang Deqing, who has extensive experience in automobile manufacturing, was very pleased to see that the workers in these factories could overcome difficulties such as rudimentary production equipment and material shortages to creatively produce high-quality products. During the inspection, Zhang Deqing introduced the advanced experience of countries such as the Soviet Union in manufacturing auto parts and accessories to the workers, and criticized the lack of protective equipment in many factories and the workers' lack of attention to safety in production.

　　Deputy Fu Zuoyi inspected the farmland water conservancy irrigation situation in the suburbs of Shanghai in detail, repeatedly listened to the farmers' demands for water conservancy irrigation, and inspected the artificial rainfall stations and pumping stations in the fields. After understanding the existing flood control, silt removal and other problems in the current farmland water conservancy work in Shanghai, he believed that to solve these problems, it is necessary to understand the hydrological conditions of Shanghai. At the same time, according to the characteristics of Shanghai's water network area, the method of repairing sluice gates for flood control should be tested with emphasis, and the method of using mobile pumping units to irrigate farmland can be considered for gradual promotion. Shanghai's agricultural water conservancy authorities believe that these opinions are very helpful to their work.

　　National People's Congress Deputies Ding Zhihui, Huang Dingchen, Zheng Zhenduo, Cai Chang and some other CPPCC members respectively inspected the work in the fields of health, culture and education. The inspectors left opinions in these departments on tapping the potential of hospitals, saving printing paper, and strengthening parents' education of their children.

　　On the afternoon of the 7th, Ke Qingshi, Cao Diqiu, Jin Zhonghua and other heads of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), specially invited deputies and members to hold a forum to listen to their opinions on various aspects of Shanghai's work.

　  全国人民代表大会代表和政协委员
　　结束在上海的视察工作
    新华社上海8日电　全国人民代表大会代表和政协全国委员会委员在上海的视察工作已经在7日结束。
    几十位代表和委员在将近半个月中视察了一百多个基层单位，对自由市场、工业生产、文化教育等各方面的工作进行了仔细的了解和讨论，并且提出了许多改进的意见。
    代表王志莘等到了上海几个最大的副食品市场，他们看到那里有大量的蔬菜、鱼虾、鸡鸭，市民们正在自由选购。在市场上交易的双方向代表们谈到国家领导下的自由市场开放以后他们的生活得到改善的情况。代表们还了解了自由市场的经营管理工作，同时向有关部门提出了要加强摊贩的政治思想教育，加强对自由市场的领导，以避免抬高价格，或产生黑市等建议。
    政协委员张德庆等视察了上海一些制造汽车配件和附件的工厂。张德庆对汽车机械制造富有经验，他看到这些工厂的工人能克服生产设备简陋、材料不足等困难，创造性地制造出质量很好的产品感到很高兴。张德庆在视察中向工人们介绍了苏联等国家制造汽车配件、附件的先进经验，并且对很多工厂缺乏防护设备、工人不重视安全生产提出了批评。
    代表傅作义在上海郊区详细地视察了农田水利灌溉的情况，多次倾听了农民对水利灌溉的要求，并且到田间视察了人工降雨站、抽水机站。他在了解了当前上海农田水利工作中存在的防汛、清淤等问题以后，认为要解决这些问题，一定要掌握上海的水文情况，同时应该根据上海这个水网地带的特点，有重点地来试验修闸防汛的办法，并且可以考虑逐步推广利用流动的抽水机来灌溉农田的方法。上海市的农业水利机关认为这些意见对他们的工作很有帮助。
    全国人民代表大会代表丁志辉、黄鼎臣、郑振铎、蔡畅和其他一些政协委员分别视察了卫生、文化教育等方面的工作。视察者在这些部门留下了有关发挥医院潜力、节约印刷纸张、加强父母对子女的教育等多方面的意见。
