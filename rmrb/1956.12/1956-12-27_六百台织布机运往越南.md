Six Hundred Looms Shipped to Vietnam
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the final batch of the six hundred looms manufactured in Shanghai this year for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were loaded onto trains on the 24th for shipment.
    These looms were manufactured by the China Textile Machinery Factory. To facilitate Vietnamese textile workers in lubricating the spindles, the workers added oil cups and oil pipes to the spindles of the looms. A layer of chromium was also added to the main parts such as the machine beam and switch handle to make these parts more rust-resistant, cleaner, and more beautiful.

    六百台织布机运往越南
    据新华社讯　上海今年为越南民主共和国制造的六百台织布机，最后一批在24日装火车运出。
    这些织布机是中国纺织机械厂制造的。为了便于越南纺织工人在主轴上加油，工人们在织布机的主轴上添装了输油的油杯和油管；在机梁、开关柄等主要零件上，还加镀了一层铬，使这些零件的防锈能力更高，更加光洁美观。
