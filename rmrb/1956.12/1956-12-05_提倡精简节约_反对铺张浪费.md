　　The Eight Yuan Blown by the Wind

　　Recently, we received a manuscript from Comrades Meng Fansi and Li Mei. The content is as follows: In mid-October, the People's Committee of Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, suddenly received 80,000 yuan in special funds remitted by the People's Committee of Jiangsu Province to repair the houses of various middle schools in Guanyun County that were hit by the typhoon. The education department of Guanyun County felt very embarrassed because the middle schools in Guanyun County had not been "attacked" by the typhoon. How to use this money? After reporting the situation and asking for instructions, the People's Committee of Jiangsu Province replied: This fund was allocated by the Central Government to our province to subsidize various places affected by typhoon damage for repairs, and 80,000 yuan should be allocated to your county. If the middle school buildings have not been damaged, it can be used for other purposes and does not need to be returned. Since this was the case, the educational leadership department of Guanyun County had no choice but to convene a meeting of middle school principals to "divide" this special fund. Some people couldn't help but sigh and wrote a poem. The poem says:

　　Although the typhoon has passed without causing disaster,

　　Eighty thousand silver dollars are allocated.

　　The middle school buildings are still good,

　　But how should the aftermath be arranged?

　　The situation reflected in this manuscript is indeed unexpected. This summer, after Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces suffered typhoon attacks and caused losses, the Central Government allocated a large amount of funds that could have been used for socialist construction to help various places repair houses. All those who suffered were grateful for the Central Government's concern for various places. However, who would have expected that the People's Committee of Jiangsu Province would waste this kind of "concern," treating this wealth created by the labor of so many people as a "task" to be "apportioned"? I wonder if they thought about a sentence in the political report made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi at the "Eighth National Congress" not long ago when they were "apportioning": "Our construction is still in its initial stage, and we should strive to accumulate every yuan of construction funds and use them most effectively." Why "generously" spend the state's money and "generously" spend the money of the people of the whole country?

　　Public Letter Soliciting Banners and Congratulatory Messages

　　On November 20, Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, held the first session of the Second People's Congress. Before the meeting, in addition to making general preparations, the County People's Committee also issued a "Public Letter Soliciting Banners, Congratulatory Messages, and Plaques." The public letter listed many "reasons," mainly explaining that this meeting had extremely important significance, such as "mobilizing all positive factors," "strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship," and "continuing to improve the work of state organs," and so on. Therefore, it was hoped that "if relevant units want to donate banners, congratulatory messages, plaques, etc., please submit them to the office of this meeting before November 18," and so on.

　　Just as the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party proposed to launch a movement to increase production and practice economy among the entire Party and the people of the whole country to oppose extravagance and waste, after reading this public letter soliciting banners and congratulatory messages, one couldn't help but feel a myriad of emotions. It seems that the practice of emphasizing ostentation and extravagance must be opposed. Because the Xianyang County People's Committee has developed from a general natural "collection" to openly issuing notices and sending public letters to "ask" for them! Although the Xianyang County People's Committee described the significance of the meeting in the public letter, who would believe that "banners, congratulatory messages, and plaques" would help "strengthen the people's democratic dictatorship" and "continue to improve the work of state organs"...?

　　Such an "Urgent Task"

　　Not long ago, the Guizhou Provincial Department of Industry called the Yangguan Brick Factory and said that there was an "urgent task" and that it was necessary to transfer two of the factory's trucks for one day. This factory was facing a crisis of suspension of work due to insufficient transportation capacity, but the higher-level organ had an "urgent task," and the lower-level organ had no choice but to obey. They had to let two production teams of more than 200 people stop working and send the trucks. However, who would have thought that while they were waiting for work to resume, their trucks were being used by cadres of the Provincial Department of Industry to go to the scenic area of Huaxi for a drive?

　　It is within the scope of authority for higher-level organs to requisition vehicles from lower-level organs, but the Guizhou Provincial Department of Industry, in order to satisfy the cadres' desire to travel, did not hesitate to use the excuse of an "urgent task" to issue orders to lower levels. How is this understanding of their own authority? What kind of thinking is this? This is worth thinking about for the Guizhou Provincial Department of Industry.

### 提倡精简节约　反对铺张浪费

　　提倡精简节约　反对铺张浪费
    风吹来的八万元
    最近我们收到孟繁思、李枚两同志的一篇稿子。内容如下：10月中旬江苏省灌云县人民委员会，突然收到江苏省人民委员会汇去的八万元专款，给灌云县各中学修理被台风袭击的房屋。灌云县教育部门感到很为难，因为灌云县的中学校并未遭受到台风的“袭击”。这笔钱如何用法呢？经过汇报情况和请示之后，江苏省人民委员会回答说：此款是中央拨给我省补助各地受台风损失修缮之用的，应摊你县八万元，如果各中学校舍未遭损失，可作其他之用，不必退回。既然如此，灌云县教育领导部门只好召开各中学校长会议来“分割”这笔专款。有人对此不胜感慨，吟诗一首。诗曰：
    台风虽过未成灾，
    八万银钱拨下来。
    中学校房依旧好，
    却教善后怎安排。
    这篇稿子反映的情况，确是出人意料之外。今年夏天，江苏、浙江等省遭受台风袭击造成损失以后，中央拨出大批本来可以用于社会主义建设事业的资金，帮助各地修缮房屋。凡身受者，无不感谢中央对各地的关怀。但是，谁会料到江苏省人民委员会竟会糟蹋了这种“关怀”，把多少人劳动创造出来的这笔财富当做“任务”“分摊”呢？不知道他们在“分摊”的时候，有没有想一想不久以前刘少奇同志在“八大”所作的政治报告中的一句话：“我们的建设还在开始，我们更应当为积累每一元的建设资金并且加以最有效的使用而奋斗”，为什么要这样“慷”国家之“慨”、“慷”全国人民之“慨”？
  征募锦旗贺词的公函
    11月20日，陕西省咸阳县召开第二届第一次人民代表大会会议。会前，县人民委员会除了作好一般准备工作以外，还发出了一个关于“征募锦旗、贺词、幛语的公函”。公函前面列举了很多“理由”，主要是说明这次会议具有极其重大的意义，诸如“调动一切积极因素”，“加强人民民主专政”，“继续改进国家机关工作”等等。因此希望“各有关单位如果想赠锦旗、贺词、幛语等件，请于11月18日前送交本会办公室”云云。
    正当党的八届二中全会提出要在全党和全国人民中开展一个增产节约运动，反对铺张浪费现象的时候，看了这个征募锦旗、贺词等的公函以后，真是令人感慨万千。看来讲排场、摆阔气之风确是不可不反。因为，咸阳县人民委员会已经由一般的自然的“收”，发展到公然出通知、发出公函来“要”了！尽管咸阳县人民委员会在公函中叙述了会议的意义，但有谁会相信“锦旗、贺词、幛语”会有助于“加强人民民主专政”“继续改进国家机关工作”……呢？
    如此“紧急任务”
    不久之前，贵州省工业厅给阳关砖厂打了一个电话，说是有
  “紧急任务”，要抽调该厂两部汽车用一天。这个厂正因为运输力量不够面临着停工待料的危机，但上级机关有“紧急任务”，下级机关只好服从，他们不得不让二百多人的两个生产班停工，把汽车派去了。可是，那里想到正当他们停工待料的时候，他们的汽车却被省工业厅的干部乘着到风景区花溪兜风去了呢？
    上级机关征调下级机关的汽车，这本来是职权范围以内的事，可是贵州省工业厅为了满足干部的游兴，不惜借口“紧急任务”，向下级发号施令，这是怎样理解自己的职权呢？这是一种什么思想呢？这是很值得贵州省工业厅想一想的。
