　　Nanyang Jade Carvings Regain Their Brilliance
　　Wang Huashan
    Leaving Nanyang City along Jiefang Road and exiting the South Gate, continuing south towards the secluded Yangjia Houkeng, there lies a modest courtyard where a crisp, clear sound frequently emanates. This is the location of the Nanyang City Jade Carving Handicraft Cooperative's workshop.
    Stepping through the gate, one is immediately captivated by the array of brightly colored, shimmering jade stones displayed in the courtyard. "Han Bai Jade" is as white as milk, "Xinshan Jade" is lightly colored and radiant, and "Dushan Jade" is both emerald and jade green, a truly dazzling sight. However, this is not the most remarkable thing, as these are still raw stones, some weighing several hundred pounds, making them impossible to lift. Section Chief Duan Shengtang led me on a tour of the jade cutting and carving workshops, where I came to understand the marvels of jade carving art.
    The south and north sides of the courtyard house two carving workshops, while the east side holds a makeshift jade-cutting workshop. Those working in the jade-cutting shed are mostly family members of cooperative members, using only a toothless iron saw blade, sprinkled with red sand and water, to cut the hard jade stones; they can cut long shapes or squares as needed. It is said that this tool was created and passed down by their predecessors, but now what used to require three people is done by one.
    The two carving workshops have thirty-three workers, a third of whom are veteran artisans. Yang Juncheng, an old artisan specializing in carving portraits, is putting the finishing touches on a bust of Lenin. He has already carved nine statues of great figures, each more lifelike than the last. Look at the eyes, nose, and slightly upturned mustache of the Lenin statue he is currently carving; how expressive they are, far more refined than the original plaster model.
    The pair of "Cranes" carved by forty-five-year-old artisan Deng Yudai are also nearing completion. The "Cranes" stand gracefully on one leg atop a carved jade platform, looking up to the sky, as spirited as the white cranes we see standing on reefs by the river. The marvel is that this pair of "Cranes" is carved from two separate pieces of jade, yet they appear to be cast from a single mold.
    Nanyang jade carving dates back to the late Ming Dynasty, about three hundred years ago. At that time, more than a thousand people were engaged in jade carving, concentrated in the area of Shagangdian, southeast of Dushan Mountain, near the present-day Nanyang City, where Dushan jade is abundant. Legend has it that there was even a "Jade Street" here, and even now, local farmers still find ancient jade shavings when plowing their fields. Nanyang jade carving has gradually improved through the continuous development of China's national culture and art, from carving ordinary women's jewelry to carving ancient figures, flowers, birds, animals, bowls, dishes, paperweights, and brush holders for daily use. Senior artisans were able to carve intricate and complex crafts such as "Eight Immortals Celebrating Longevity" and "Scholar Asking a Boy Under Pine Trees," with no less than a hundred different samples. These jade wares are carved from Hanbai jade and Dushan jade, and due to the novel colors of the jade, they appear more exquisite and beautiful after the processing of carving art, making them popular gifts. Thus, Nanyang jade ware is sold to Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and cities, and is famous throughout the country.
    However, in the old society, artisans engaged in jade carving were not valued, and their lives declined day by day. Famous artisans such as Lu Daguan and others died of hunger and cold in ancient temples. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to war and chaos, and the closure of transport, the jade carving industry almost completely ceased, and the number of people employed shrank to dozens, and later only simple daily necessities such as jade seals and jade cigarette holders were made.
    In order to restore and develop the art of Nanyang jade carving, the People's Government first led the artisans to organize jade carving mutual aid groups, which were transformed into cooperatives in April last year, implementing a technical wage system and establishing a public medical care system; in the recent wage adjustment, many workers have increased their wages. The workers' interest in studying carving art has been greatly improved. In the old society, jade carving was generally not passed on to outsiders, but now old artisans are taking apprentices; whenever a new product is produced, old artisans always carefully discuss improvements together. Now they can carve new products such as statues of great men, sika deer, peace doves, jade flutes, elephants, cranes, squirrels, vases, cigarette dishes, lions, white rabbits, and water buffaloes. In August this year, Chongqing Battery Factory in Sichuan specially sent people to Nanyang to order a three-month contract to carve "battery molds", and jade carving has also begun to serve industrial construction.

### 南阳玉器重发光

　　南阳玉器重发光
　　王华山
    沿南阳市解放路出南门，再一直往南走去，在僻静的杨家后坑不远的地方，有一座不太宽敞的四合院，里面经常发出一种清脆的响声。这便是南阳市玉器手工业社的工场所在地。
    跨进大门，首先吸引人的是摆在院里的各种色彩鲜艳、闪闪发光的玉石。“汉白玉石”洁白如乳，“新山玉石”色淡发亮，“独山玉石”，又翠又绿，真是琳琅满目，美不胜收。这尚不足为奇，因为它毕竟还是一块块的原坯子，一块有好几百斤重，叫你拿也拿不动。社副主任段生堂领着我参观了解玉、雕刻的各车间后，才了解到玉器雕刻艺术里面的妙处。
    院子的南面和北面是两个雕刻车间，东面是临时搭的解玉石车间。在解玉石棚里工作的多是社员家属，她们仅只用一根没齿的铁片锯条，撒上红砂，浇上水，就可以把坚硬的玉石解开；要长形的能解长形的，要方的能给解成方的。据说这工具还是前人创造传下来的，不过现在由过去三人操作改为一人操作了。
    两个雕刻车间有三十三个工人，其中三分之一都是老艺人。专长雕刻人物像的杨俊诚老艺人，正在作列宁胸像的最后修饰工作。他已经雕刻了九个伟人像，一个比一个逼真。你看他现在雕刻的列宁像的眼睛、鼻子和朝前稍翘的胡须，是多么的传神，比原来的石膏像细腻多了。
    四十五岁的老艺人邓玉岱所雕刻的一对“仙鹤”也快要完工了。“仙鹤”独脚亭立在刻有花纹的玉石台上，仰头望着天，好像我们在河边所见到的站在礁石上的白鹤一样有神气。奥妙的还是：这一对“仙鹤”，是用两块玉石雕刻成的，而却像一个模子铸成的。
    南阳玉器雕刻，早在明末就有了，距今已约有三百年历史。那时候，从事玉器雕刻的有千余人，集中于现今的南阳市北、盛产独山玉石的独山东南沙岗店一带。相传这里还有“玉街”之称，现今当地农民在犁田耙地时还能发现古代雕刻的玉屑。南阳玉器雕刻是在我国民族文化艺术的不断发展中而逐步提高的，由雕刻一般的妇女首饰，进而雕刻古代人物、花草、鸟兽、碗碟和压尺、笔架等日常用具。高级的艺人很早就能雕刻“八仙庆寿”、“松下问童子”等精细复杂的工艺品，样品不下百余种。这些玉器都是用汉白玉、独山玉雕刻成的，由于玉石色彩新颖，经过雕刻艺术的加工更显得精致美观，惹人喜爱，成为送人的嘉品。因而南阳玉器远销内蒙古、河北、陕西、云南、四川与两广等省市，驰名全国。
    但是，旧社会对从事玉器雕刻的艺人是不重视的，艺人的生活是一日不如一日的在下降。有名的艺人鲁大官等三人，就是因饥寒而死于古庙内的。抗日战争后，兵荒马乱，交通闭塞，玉器雕刻业几乎全部停歇，从业人员减缩到数十人，以后就仅只作些玉石章、玉烟嘴等简单的日用品。
    为了恢复和发展南阳玉器的雕刻艺术，人民政府首先领导艺人们组织了玉器雕刻互助组，去年4月转成了合作社，实行了技术工资制，建立公费医疗制度；在最近的工资调整中又有许多工人增加了工资。工人们钻研雕刻艺术的兴趣大为提高。在旧社会时玉器雕刻一般是艺不外传的，现在老艺人都带学徒了；每生产一种新产品，老艺人总是经常在一起细心商量改进。现在他们已能雕刻的新产品有伟人像、梅花鹿、和平鸽、玉笛、象、仙鹤、松鼠、花瓶、烟盘、狮子、小白兔、水牛等。今年8月间四川重庆电池厂特派人到南阳订了三个月的雕刻“电池母”的合同，玉器雕刻也开始为工业建设服务了。
