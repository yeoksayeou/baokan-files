　　Pirate-style "Contribution"
　　Gǔ Fán
　　In mid-November, the United States handed over three warships to the Chiang Kai-shek group at the Yokosuka naval base in Japan. When handing over these warships, Vice Admiral Goode, commander of the U.S. Far East Navy, said: The United States' handover of these warships to the Chiang Kai-shek group is not only "a manifestation of the spirit of the United Nations" but also "another contribution to the belief in basic human rights" made by the United States.
　　How beautiful and pleasant the words sound! But what is the truth when we uncover it? It so happens that three weeks before the United States handed over these three warships to the Chiang Kai-shek group, the West German government announced that it had handed over a note to the U.S. embassy for transmission to the Chiang Kai-shek group, protesting the shelling of the West German merchant ship "Monica" by the Chiang army and demanding compensation. In this shelling, the ship's mechanic, Harold Martens, was killed, and two others were injured. Everyone knows that the warships and munitions used by the Chiang army are supplied by the United States. The innocent suffering of this West German merchant ship is precisely one of the most concrete "contributions" of the United States to the "spirit of the United Nations" and "basic human rights."
　　In recent years, the crimes committed by the United States in openly equipping and supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group in conducting piracy are countless. From 1949 to the present, the Chiang Kai-shek group's troops, driving U.S.-supplied warships, have sunk, intercepted, and attacked foreign merchant ships at sea more than a hundred times, with about eighty ships victimized, including ships from Britain, Panama, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, Norway, Greece, West Germany, and Italy. The United States not only "contributed" warships and weapons for the Chiang Kai-shek group to commit evil, but American advisors also acted as commanders. The radar equipment of U.S. warships and U.S. aircraft helped the Chiang army conduct searches and reconnaissance, guiding it to rob merchant ships of various countries.
　　As for the fishermen along the coast of Fujian in our country, to what extent they have been poisoned by this group of accomplices committing crimes, one example is enough to see. Fishermen Ou Fali and others from Lianjiang County, Fujian, were fishing at sea in small boats when two U.S.-made Chiang army warships first shelled them, and then revved up their engines and overturned the fishing boats, throwing the fishermen into the turbulent sea.
　　Obviously, the United States' continued handover of warships and weapons to the Chiang Kai-shek group is not only to encourage and support the Chiang Kai-shek group to carry out more of this bloody and murderous piracy, but the U.S. aggressive group also harbors greater sinister intentions, attempting to continue to occupy our country's territory of Taiwan and use the Chiang army as a tool to threaten peace and security in the Far East. These facts show to what a serious extent solemn words such as "spirit of the United Nations" and "basic human rights" have been defiled in the mouths of American imperialist elements.

　　海盗式的“贡献”
　　古凡
    11月中旬，美国在日本横须贺军港把三艘军舰交给蒋介石集团。在移交这些军舰的时候，美国远东海军司令古德海军中将说：美国把这些军舰交给蒋介石集团，不仅仅是“联合国的精神的表现”，而且是美国“对基本人权的信念作出的又一贡献”。
    话说得多么美妙动听！但揭开来看究竟如何呢？事情很凑巧，就在美国把这三艘军舰交给蒋介石集团的前三个星期，西德政府宣布已经把一份照会交给美国使馆转交蒋介石集团，抗议蒋军炮击西德商船“莫尼卡”号，并且要求赔偿。在这次炮击中，船上的机工哈罗德·马顿斯被打死了，另外两人受伤。谁都知道，蒋军所用的舰艇、军火是美国供给的。这艘西德商船的无辜受难，正就是美国对“联合国精神”和“基本人权”最具体的“贡献”之一。
    几年来，美国这种公开地装备和支持蒋介石集团进行海盗活动所犯下的罪行是不可胜计的。从1949年到现在，蒋介石集团部队驾驶着美国供给的作战舰艇，先后在海上击沉、拦劫和袭击外国商船一百多次，受害船只约八十艘，其中包括英国、巴拿马、苏联、荷兰、丹麦、波兰、挪威、希腊、西德、意大利等国的船只。美国不光是“贡献”了舰艇和武器供蒋介石集团作恶，美国顾问还充当指挥。美军舰只的雷达设备和美国飞机帮助蒋军进行搜索和侦察，引导它动手去打劫各国的商船。
    至于我国福建沿海的渔民，受这一批合伙行凶的海盗的荼毒到如何程度，举一个例子看看就够了。福建连江县的渔民瓯法利等驾着小船在海上捕鱼，两艘美造蒋军军舰先是向他们发炮轰击，然后又开足马力把渔船撞翻，把渔民掀到波浪滔滔的海里去。
    显然，美国继续把舰艇武器交给蒋介石集团，不只是要鼓励和支持蒋介石集团更多地进行这种血腥的杀人越货的海盗行为，美国侵略集团还包藏着更大的祸心，企图继续霸占我国的领土台湾，并且利用蒋军充当它威胁远东和平和安全的一个工具。这样一些事实说明，像“联合国精神”、“基本人权”等这些庄严的字眼，在美国帝国主义分子口中已被污损到了多么严重的程度。
