Xinhua News Agency Report by Li Zhengjie: Elementary school teachers in Tianjin exchanged experiences in guiding students from December 12th to 14th. Some outstanding teachers who have achieved success in guiding students introduced their experiences in this area to more than eight thousand teachers.

	I. Pay attention to cultivating good habits in children from the time they enter school. Xu Zhongxiu, a teacher at Bo'ai Road Elementary School in Hebei District who has been teaching first grade for seventeen years, welcomes newly enrolled children with a happy attitude every school year. She first pays attention to observing and familiarizing herself with the students, and leads the students to become familiar with the school environment, so that the children do not feel unfamiliar or restrained. As soon as the class bell rings, Xu Zhongxiu goes to the classroom and places textbooks and other items in a specific place after class. She uses her own exemplary actions to cultivate children's habits of observing discipline and order. She also frequently visits parents to understand the students' personalities and characteristics, and at the same time asks parents to cooperate with the school to jointly cultivate children's good qualities and habits.

	II. There are no incorrigible children. Wu Hongbin, from Beizhulin Village Elementary School in Hongqiao District, has already been promoted to the fourth grade and wears a red scarf, but this student had previously beaten classmates, cursed teachers, stolen things, and often wandered the streets.

	Last year, Wu Hongbin was held back for the fourth time and transferred to the class of teacher Hu Demin at the school. After Hu Demin carefully understood Wu Hongbin's situation, he discovered that in the past, whenever this child made a mistake, he was always reprimanded by the teachers, or else he was reported to his parents, who always adopted a beating and scolding approach. Because everyone could not see the child's advantages, the child did not feel warmth. Hu Demin first reversed the views of teachers, parents, and classmates towards Wu Hongbin, and at the same time frequently approached Wu Hongbin, first asking him to sew the buttons on his clothes neatly and wash his hands and face clean. After Wu Hongbin began to pay attention to these issues, the teacher encouraged his progress. Through long-term contact, the teacher also discovered that the child had many advantages such as a strong desire to improve, and also praised his good performances. Because Hu Demin often contacted Wu Hongbin, told him stories of heroic figures, and provided him with books to read, Wu Hongbin gradually felt the warmth of the teacher's care and took the initiative to admit his mistakes. When Wu Hongbin asked to join the Young Pioneers, Hu Demin further cultivated his qualities of loving and caring for the collective.

	III. Help students in the two-shift system organize extracurricular activities. Lou Wanying, a sixth-grade teacher at Nanjing Road Elementary School in Xinhua District, heard before this year's summer vacation that the two-shift system would be implemented after the start of school. She used the summer vacation to visit several parents and learned that more than half of the students in the class could not be taken care of because their parents were busy with work or had many children. After the start of school, she organized the children into fifteen student family groups, and she often went to each group to participate in activities with the children. In addition to reviewing their lessons, the students participating in these groups also conduct various meaningful activities.

    如何培养儿童的优良品质
    天津小学教师交流辅导工作经验
    据新华社讯　新华社记者李正杰报道，天津市的小学教师从12日到14日交流了辅导学生工作的经验。一些辅导学生工作有成绩的优秀教师，向八千多名教师介绍了他们在这方面的经验。
    一、从儿童入学时就注意培养他们的优良习惯。担任了十七年一年级教育工作的河北区博爱道小学教师徐钟秀，每个学年开始都以愉快的心情迎接新入学的儿童。她首先注意观察学生、熟悉学生，并领学生们熟悉学校环境，使孩子们不感到生疏、拘束。上课铃一响，徐钟秀就去教室，上课后把课本等放在一定的地方。她用自己的模范行动，来培养儿童遵守纪律、守秩序的习惯。她还经常访问家长，了解学生的个性、特点，同时要求家长配合学校共同培养儿童的优良品质和习惯。
    二、没有不可救药的孩子。红桥区北竹林村小学的吴鸿宾已经升入四年级而且带上红领巾了，但是这个学生在过去曾打同学、骂教师、偷过东西，而且经常在街上游荡。
    在去年，吴鸿宾第四次留级，调到该校教师胡德敏的班上以后，胡德敏首先仔细地了解了吴鸿宾的情况，他发现这个孩子过去一犯错误，就受到教师们的斥责，再不然就到家长那里告状，家长也总是采取打骂的方式。由于大家都看不到这个孩子的优点，使这个孩子感不到温暖。胡德敏就先扭转教师、家长和同学对吴鸿宾的看法，同时经常和吴鸿宾接近，先要求他把衣服上的扣子钉齐，把手脸洗干净。吴鸿宾开始注意了这些问题以后，教师又鼓励他的进步。经过长期的接触，教师还发现这个孩子具有强烈的进取心等许多优点，也表扬他的这些好的表现。由于胡德敏经常同吴鸿宾接触，给他讲英雄人物的故事，供给他书看，吴鸿宾逐渐感到老师关怀的温暖，就主动承认了自己的错误。当吴鸿宾要求参加少先队的时候，胡德敏又进一步培养他热爱和关心集体的品质。
    三、帮助二部制的学生组织课外活动。新华区南京道小学六年级教师楼婉瑛，在今年暑假前听说开学后要实行二部制，她就利用暑假的时间访问了几个学生家长，了解到班里学生中有二分之一以上的家长由于工作忙或者子女多，没法照顾孩子。开学后，她就把孩子组成了十五个学生家庭小组，她也经常到各小组和孩子们一起活动。参加这些小组的学生除温习功课外，还进行各种有意义的活动。
