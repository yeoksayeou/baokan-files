    Expanded Planting Area, Increased Cash Crops
    Increased Yield Per Unit, Developed Diversified Operations
    Xinjiang Local State-Owned Farms Begin to Show a Surplus
    (Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi) Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's local state-owned farms have reversed their inability to be self-sufficient this year. According to statistics from thirty-seven special districts, autonomous prefectures, and county farms, a total surplus of 205,200 yuan is expected.
    This year, the local state-owned farms in the autonomous region learned from the losses of previous years and made significant improvements in four aspects: expanding planting area, increasing cash crops, increasing yield per unit area, and developing diversified operations. The total planting area of the region's forty-five local state-owned farms exceeded the original plan by 17.7%, reaching more than 67,000 mu. The farms generally implemented basic measures to increase production, such as adopting improved varieties, using new agricultural tools for cultivation, applying fertilizer, and practicing frequent, shallow irrigation. As a result, the yield per unit area of ​​grain and oil crops increased by 34% and 40% respectively compared to last year. The average yield of seed cotton reached 262 jin per mu, with the yield of the Makit County Farm reaching as high as 460 jin per mu.
    Subsidiary production, which was previously neglected by the farms, has also received widespread attention this year. The increased income from livestock, poultry, and other diversified operations on the farms has accounted for 20% of the total agricultural income.

    扩大了播种面积　增加了经济作物
    提高了单位产量　开展了多种经营
    新疆地方国营农场开始有盈余
    据新华社乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区地方国营农场今年扭转了不能自给的局面，根据三十七个专区、自治州和县的农场统计，共可盈余二十万五千二百多元。
    今年自治区各地方国营农场接受了往年亏损的教训，在扩大播种面积、增加经济作物、提高单位面积产量和开展多种经营等四个方面，比往年大有改进。全区四十五个地方国营农场，今年播种面积超过原订计划17.7％，共达六万七千多亩。各农场大都贯彻了采用优良品种，利用新式农具耕作，施肥，勤浇浅灌等增产基本措施。因此粮食和油料作物的单位面积产量分别比去年提高了34％和40％。籽棉平均每亩产量达到二百六十二斤，其中麦盖提县农场的产量更高达每亩四百六十斤。
    过去被各农场忽视的副业生产，今年也普遍受到了注意。农场在饲养家畜、家禽和其他多种经营方面增加的收入，已经占到农业总收入的20％。
