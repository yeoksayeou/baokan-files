	Film, Songs, and Youth

In recent years, we have selected and dubbed some foreign films from outside the socialist camp, which has greatly benefited the enhancement of our people's understanding of these countries and peoples, and strengthened the friendship and cultural exchange between the peoples of various countries. Because of the selection process, the ideological tendencies of these films are generally good, and some can even be said to belong to the realm of socialist realism art. Moreover, their artistic quality is generally high. Therefore, they have been welcomed by the broad masses of Chinese film audiences. However, over time, the facts tell us that this very good work also has an aspect that has not been done thoroughly enough: we have not timely and sufficiently analyzed and criticized the ideological weaknesses of some films, and explained them clearly to the audience. Of course, the practice of thinking that films with slight "problems" should not be dubbed or shown is too timid and does not trust the level of the audience enough. However, it is not reasonable to keep silent about the "problems" that exist, only talking about art but not about ideology. Moreover, the problems involve ideology, relate to the moral education of young people, and the general social atmosphere, and film is such a powerful cultural weapon. It is too hasty to call the reasonable concern about adverse effects "neurasthenia." Some facts cannot be ignored.

What are the facts? Recently, newspapers have published news about the corruption and even depravity and crime of a small number of teenagers in large cities. The reasons for these events are complex and diverse, and the few points roughly revealed in a short news item cannot be used as the sole basis. Nor can we treat these causal relationships with a simple equation like one plus one equals two. However, the fact that some literary works and films mentioned by juvenile offenders in their confessions of remorse have an impact on them cannot but make people feel shocked.

A primary school student sentenced to fifteen years in prison for theft and murder said: "...No one taught me. I learned it myself by listening to teachers tell stories about scouts and guerrillas, and reading picture books about the People's Liberation Army and public security personnel catching special agents and bandits in a miraculous way. After watching the movie 'The Vagabond', I envied Raj's skills, so I learned to climb walls."

A nineteen-year-old middle school student, a habitual thief who had stolen dozens of times, described his interest in literature and art in this way: He had read many martial arts novels since he was a child. In junior high school, he was a fan of detective novels. When he got older, he fell in love with obscene and absurd romance novels. A foreign film depicting a wandering youth fascinated him even more. He pitied the orphan in the film, but he also envied the life of wandering and stealing, especially since there was a beautiful rich girl who loved him. Later, he actually found a girlfriend, and they both loved to sing "Raj's Song."

The harm of yellow books has been repeatedly exposed and publicized among the masses, so I won’t talk about it here for the time being. Whether there are any shortcomings in the picture books about catching special agents and bandits is a question that should be investigated and studied, so I won’t talk about it here for the time being. Here, a fresh matter is very eye-catching: the above two juvenile offenders both mentioned the influence of the Indian film "The Vagabond" on them. – Please do not misunderstand, I have already stated that I am by no means trying to view the formation of complex human character and behavior in a very simple and mechanical way; nor do I have any intention of shifting any responsibility onto our foreign friends. I just want to say that when introducing good films by progressive film artists from our friendly countries, it is still possible and should be pointed out its weaknesses, especially ideological defects, if it does exist. As long as the criticism is pertinent and appropriate, I believe that foreign friends will not take offense. Cultural exchange work with foreign countries must be adhered to and expanded, but this does not prevent us from expressing our own views at the same time.

"The Vagabond," one of the excellent Indian films, is still being shown in our cities and has not waned. The song "Raj's Song" in the film is extremely popular among young people, which proves that both the film and the song have a high degree of artistic appeal. It also reflects the friendship and understanding of Chinese youth towards the Indian people, as well as the valuable sympathy for those souls in the film who have been tormented and hurt by social injustice. However, it should also be said that the film's handling of Raj's tragedy is not without incorrect and unserious elements in terms of viewpoint and method; nor is the structure of the plot without places that deviate from reality. Although we should not be too demanding of our friendly Indian artists, since the film is being shown in our country, in order to adhere to our ideological principles and to be responsible for our teenagers and children, it is necessary to make some appropriate explanations. I think it is necessary and will also help cultivate the audience's aesthetic ability; but this point has not been done enough in the past.

Not long ago, an article in Shanghai's "Liberation Daily" pointed out that the singing of "Raj's Song" was widely popular locally, and "the sound of 'wandering everywhere, wandering everywhere...' could be heard almost everywhere" (see Yao Mu's "Too Much 'Wandering Everywhere'!" in the November 8th "Liberation Daily"). The author affirmed the advantages of this song and did not oppose its translation into Chinese records, but expressed "unease" about "inappropriate introduction and promotion." I think this "unease" is reasonable. Although there are unclear and not completely appropriate places in this article, it is good that the author raised this issue in a timely manner. It is especially worth noting that the author believes that the Chinese record singer "translated and sang this song of painful accusation with a frivolous and playful tone," which "will deepen the adverse effects of this song circulating among the masses." I have not carefully studied this record. If this musician's judgment is correct, I also think it is not good. Speaking of this, I feel even more the importance of art criticism and its realistic significance that cannot be ignored. Understanding this work only as guiding creation probably diminishes its role.

Perhaps some people will say that moviegoers do not necessarily read film reviews, and music listeners do not necessarily read music criticism, but this can in no way be an excuse for critics to be negligent in their work. As long as the banner of public opinion with bright colors is raised high in the air, people will feel its brilliance.

    电影·歌曲·青年
    袁水拍
    近年来我们选译放映了一些社会主义阵营以外的外国的影片，对于增进我国人民对这些国家和人民的了解，加强各国人民之间的友谊和文化交流，是有很大好处的。由于经过了选择，这些影片的思想倾向一般都是较好的，有的可以说是属于社会主义现实主义艺术的范围，更不消说，它们的艺术性一般都比较高。因此，它们受到了我国广大电影观众的欢迎。但是，久而久之，事实告诉我们，这件很好的工作也还有未曾做到家的一个方面：对有某些影片的思想意识上的弱点，我们没有及时地足够地加以分析批评，向观众说清楚。当然，那种认为略有“问题”就不能译制、不能放映的做法，是过于胆小，太不相信观众的水平；但是，“问题”既然存在，却不声张，只谈艺术，不谈思想，也不是道理。更何况问题涉及思想意识，关系到青年的道德教育，以及一般社会风气，而电影又是那样一种威力极大的文化武器。把那种对不良影响的合理的担忧，说成是什么“神经衰弱”，未免过于轻率。有些事实是不容我们忽视的。
    事实是什么呢？最近报纸上登载了大城市里少数青少年生活腐化甚至堕落犯罪的新闻。造成这些事件的原因是复杂多样的，决不能把短短一条新闻中所粗略地揭露的几条，作为全部根据；也决不能用一加一等于二那样简单的算式，去对待这些因果关系。可是青少年犯罪者在悔过自白中所提到的某些文艺读物和电影对于他们的影响这一事实，却不能不使人发生触目惊心的感觉。
    一个因偷盗杀人被判处十五年徒刑的小学生说：“……没有人教过。我是听了老师讲侦察兵、游击队的一些故事，看了一些解放军、公安人员神出鬼没地抓特务、捉土匪的小人书，自己体会到的。看了电影‘流浪者’，拉兹的本事使我羡慕，因此，我学会了翻墙。”
    一个偷盗了几十次的惯窃、十九岁的中学生这样叙述他对于文艺的兴趣：从小就读了不少武侠小说。初中时，是个侦探小说迷。再大一些的时候，又爱上了淫秽、荒诞的言情小说。一部外国来的、描写一个流浪青年的电影，使他更加着迷。他怜悯电影里的孤儿，可是他也羡慕那种流浪和偷窃的生活，何况还有一个美貌的千金小姐爱着他。后来他果然找到一个女友，他们两人都爱唱“拉兹之歌”。
    黄色图书的为害已经一再在群众中揭露和宣传，这里暂且不谈；抓特务、捉土匪的小人书当中，是否有一些存在着缺点，这问题应该调查研究，也暂且不谈。这里，一件新鲜事情很引人注目：上述两个青少年罪犯都提到了印度影片“流浪者”对于他们的影响。——请各方面不要误会，我早已声明，这里决不是企图把复杂的人的性格、行为的形成，看得十分简单和机械；更毫无意思要把任何责任推在国外的朋友们身上。我只是想说，当介绍我们的友邦的、友好的进步电影艺术家们的好影片的时候，还是不妨并且应该指出它的弱点，特别是思想意识上的缺陷，如果它确实是存在着的话。只要批评得中肯、得体，我相信国外的朋友们是不会见怪的。对外文化交流工作要坚持并且要扩大，可是这样做并不妨碍我们同时也拿出我们自己的观点来。
    优美的印度影片之一“流浪者”至今还在我们的城市里上映不衰，片中的歌曲“拉兹之歌”在青年中流传极盛，证明了影片和歌曲都具有高度的艺术感染力，也反映了我国青年对于印度人民的友好和理解，以及对于片中那些被社会不平所折磨和伤害的灵魂的可贵同情。但是，也应该说，这部影片对于拉兹的悲剧的处理，在观点和方法上，并不是没有不正确、不严肃的成分；在情节的结构上，也并不是没有离开真实的地方。尽管我们不应该对我们友好的印度艺术家们有什么苛求，可是影片既然在我国放映，为了坚持我们的思想原则，为了对于我们的青少年和儿童负责，恰当地作一些解释，我看是必要的，对于培养观众的审美能力也会有帮助；而这一点，过去是做得不够的。
    不久以前，上海“解放日报”上有文章指出，当地广泛地流行着唱“拉兹之歌”，“几乎无处不是‘到处流浪，到处流浪……’的歌声”（见11月8日“解放日报”载姚牧作“‘到处流浪’太多了！”）。作者肯定了这支歌曲的优点，也没有反对译制为汉语唱片，只是对于“不恰当地介绍和推广”，表现了“不安”，我想这点“不安”是合理的。尽管这篇文章里有说得不清楚、不完全恰当的地方，作者及时地提出这个问题来是好的。尤其值得注意的是，作者认为汉语唱片演唱者，“把这一沉痛控诉的歌曲，译唱得带有轻浮嬉戏的情调”，“会加深此歌在群众中流传着不良影响的”。我没有仔细研究这张唱片，如果这位音乐家的判断是正确的话，我也认为这是不好的。说到这里，我更加感觉到艺术批评的重要性，它的不容忽视的现实意义。把这个工作仅仅理解为指导创作，恐怕是缩小了它的作用。
    也许有人会说，电影观众不一定看影评，音乐听众也不一定看音乐批评，但是这无论如何不能成为批评家对于他们的工作有任何懈怠的借口。只要色彩鲜明的舆论的旗帜高扬空中，人们是会感受到它的光芒的。
