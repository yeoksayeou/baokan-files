    It Would Be Best to Convert to RMB
    I often see the names of foreign currencies in newspapers and magazines. For example, this time our country donated 20 million Swiss francs to Egypt, but we don’t know how much that is in RMB. I hope that when newspapers publish this kind of news, it would be best to indicate how much these foreign currencies are worth in RMB.

    最好折合成人民币
    我经常在报刊上看到外国的货币名称，例如这次我国赠送给埃及二千万瑞士法郎，我们就不知道合多少人民币。我希望报纸在发表这类消息时，最好注明这些外币合多少人民币。

    编者按：本报收到很多读者来信，提出了同样的要求。今后我们将尽可能地这样做。
