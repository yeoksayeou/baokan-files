Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 19th: Soviet authorities recently decided not to prosecute an American spy who voluntarily surrendered. This is because the American spy, named Morozov, surrendered to the relevant authorities immediately after entering Soviet territory and honestly confessed his connections with American intelligence agencies.

Morozov said in his surrender that he crossed the Soviet border illegally under the orders of American intelligence agencies. The task assigned to him by the American intelligence agencies was to collect intelligence on particularly important Soviet defense targets.

It has been ascertained that Morozov is a traitor to the Soviet Union. He lived in West Germany for a long time. In 1954, he was recruited by American intelligence agencies, and his activities were directed by an American agent named Mueller. In January of this year, Morozov was sent to a special espionage school in Washington for training. After completing his training, he was sent to Turkey in May of this year with an American intelligence officer, and then infiltrated into Soviet territory.

    一名美间谍向苏联自首
    老实交代后受到宽大待遇
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联主管当局最近决定对一名自动投案的美国间谍免于起诉。这是由于这个名叫莫罗兹的美国间谍在潜入苏联国境以后，就立刻向有关机关自首，并且老实地说出了他同美国特务机关的联系。
    莫罗兹在自首的时候说，他是按照美国特务机关的命令偷越苏联国境的。美国特务机关给他的任务是收集关于苏联特别重要的防御目标的情报。
    已经查明，莫罗兹是一个苏联的叛徒。他曾经在西德住了很长的时间。1954年他被美国特务机关招募，指导他的活动的是美国特务缪勒。今年1月，莫罗兹被送到华盛顿的一个特别的谍报学校里受训。受训完毕以后，他在今年5月同一个美国特务军官一道被送到土耳其，然后潜入了苏联国境。
