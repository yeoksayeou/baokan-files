Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 30th: According to the Polish News Agency, the talks between the delegation of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which was visiting Poland at the invitation of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, have concluded.

The communiqué issued here states that the two party delegations reached full mutual understanding on the issues discussed. Both sides discussed the path towards socialist development, and also paid great attention to the role of the party in leading socialist construction.

The communiqué stated that both sides confirmed that socialist ideology has achieved great historical victories in the forty years since the Great October Revolution. The further development of socialism in countries building socialism is of great significance for the further victory of progressive social development on a global scale.

Both sides emphasized that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was of great significance for the development of socialist theory and practice, for invigorating the international working-class movement, and for creating favorable conditions for correct cooperation between communist and workers' parties of all countries. Both sides unanimously emphasized that countries can reach socialism through different paths, which will enrich the various social forms of the inevitable development towards socialism in various countries.

The communiqué also stated that both sides agreed on the need for bilateral cooperation between parties, based on providing broad information and engaging in sincere discussions between parties to help clarify differences of opinion or reach consensus on certain issues. Such discussions, as well as constructive and sincere criticism when necessary, should help develop the theory and practice of socialism and should not lead to interference in the internal affairs of parties or countries. Consistent adherence to these principles in mutual cooperation will strengthen the internationalist ties between communist and workers' parties of all countries and consolidate the unity between socialist countries.

Both sides believe that bilateral relations between parties are currently the most appropriate form of cooperation between communist and workers' parties of all countries. However, this does not preclude broader cooperation between communist and workers' parties and progressive movements on various issues of common concern.

The communiqué pointed out that both sides agreed that in the struggle to ease international tensions and consolidate world peace, and in the struggle to safeguard the interests of the working class and oppressed nations, it is necessary to establish and expand cooperation with socialist parties and progressive movements that are willing to cooperate on the basis of equality of rights and non-interference in internal affairs.

Both sides affirmed that the cooperation between the Polish United Workers' Party and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has yielded results and believe that this cooperation should be further expanded. In this regard, both sides hope to further exchange delegations of various levels of the party, exchange party publications and newspapers, and exchange opinions and experiences through all other forms of cooperation between parties.

The communiqué concluded that both sides are deeply convinced that this cooperation between the two parties will also have a good effect on the development of friendly relations between Yugoslavia and Poland, which will help consolidate the socialist construction of the two countries and promote the cause of peace throughout the world.
