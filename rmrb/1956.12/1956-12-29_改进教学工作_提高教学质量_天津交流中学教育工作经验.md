　　Improve Teaching Work, Improve Teaching Quality
　　Tianjin Exchanges Middle School Education Work Experience
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th - The Tianjin Municipal Middle School Education Work Experience Exchange Conference, which began on the 19th, concluded on the 26th. More than seventy teachers exchanged their experiences in various teaching segments and in tutoring students at the meeting.
　　This experience exchange was conducted in ten subjects, including Chinese, mathematics, and biology. Teachers in each subject widely exchanged teaching experiences in preparing lessons, consolidating students' knowledge, and conducting labor education for students. Qu Chuanxiu, a Chinese teacher from Tianjin No. 16 Middle School, introduced her experience in conducting political and ideological education in classical literature teaching. After the abolition of political classes in most secondary schools, this provided rich experience for implementing political and ideological education in Chinese language teaching. Liu Tiezheng, a physics teacher from Tianjin No. 1 Middle School, addressed the shortcomings of students memorizing definitions and applying formulas indiscriminately, and researched many methods to help students think and understand.
　　The Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau plans to propose reform plans for teaching work in various subjects based on the experiences exchanged this time and the opinions put forward by the teachers.

    改进教学工作　提高教学质量
    天津交流中学教育工作经验
    新华社天津27日电　天津市从19日开始举行的中学教育工作经验交流大会在26日结束。七十多名教师在会上交流了他们在各个教学环节中的心得和辅导学生的经验。
    这次经验交流是分语文、数学、生物等十个科进行的，各科教师都广泛地交流了备课、巩固学生的知识、向学生进行劳动教育等方面教学经验。天津市第十六中学语文教师渠川琇介绍的在古典文学教学中进行政治思想教育的经验，在目前中等学校中绝大部分班级取消了政治课以后，为语文教学贯彻政治思想教育提供了丰富的经验。天津市第一中学物理教师刘铁铮针对学生学习中存在着背定义、乱套公式的缺点，研究出许多帮助学生思考和理解的办法。
    天津市教育局准备根据这次交流的经验和教师们提出的意见，提出各科教学工作的改革方案。
