    Random Thoughts on Listening to Songs
    Li Ling
    A friend told me on the phone that many people wanted to hear performances of songs from the "May Fourth" period and asked if I was interested. He also said that tickets were hard to get.
    The concert at the opera house did focus on introducing some of the better songs from the "May Fourth" era, such as "On the Jialing River," "Midnight Song," "How Can I Not Think of Her," "Tea Mountain Love Song," "Eulogy to Family," and "I Live at the Head of the Yangtze River."
    The performers put in a lot of effort in singing these pieces; most of the performers were reuniting with these songs after a long time, while some were trying them for the first time. Therefore, it cannot be said that these performances are all excellent repertoire pieces yet. But many audience members felt joyful, as if they had met an old friend.
    For several years, these better programs have almost disappeared from our usual concerts. However, some performers have never forgotten them, and the audience may not necessarily not want to hear them. The main reason for the few performances, non-performance, or fear of performing is that "these programs mostly tell of the painful life of the past and reflect things of the past era, with no practical significance."
    Of course, our performances should always be concerned with raising the audience's socialist awareness and enthusiasm. People need things that directly and closely reflect the reality of the struggle, but also need to gain knowledge and encouragement from works that reflect the struggle of the past.
    Appreciating music of the past is a bit like reviewing history. Understanding the wounds of the old society deepens our understanding of the old society and enhances our love for the happy life of today. A very young violinist said after watching the movie "Midnight Song": "Today I learned more about the difficult situation of the predecessors." Isn't that interesting?
    Many of the better songs since the "May Fourth" Movement are striving to figure out how to be more original in style and more suitable for expressing national life and emotions. Many songs closely reflect the emotional feeling of the time. I don't want to say much about this. But one thing is that the combination of tunes and language, meaning and semantics of those excellent songs, and the profound expression of thoughts have their unique merits. Like the intimate and profound phrases in "Midnight Song," "In this long dark night, who waits with me for dawn," "What can I use to express my anger, only the rushing of the river, what can I use to comfort your loneliness, only this midnight song," the meticulous handling of the poetic imagery in "How Can I Not Think of Her" and "I Live at the Head of the Yangtze River," and the gentleness and harmony of "Eulogy to Family," often leave a deep impression. Although the content of these songs is still worth studying; however, the profound and unique techniques of certain aspects that the previous generation of composers paid attention to are also good experiences that we need to learn from. This may also be a factor that many listeners "never forget."
    Many people are very satisfied to hear the increasingly mature achievements of Zhang Quan, Lou Qian’gui, Zheng Xingli, Zou Dehua, and Li Weibo on the stage. However, I can't help but think that in recent years, there have been too few opportunities for our actors with solo and duet talents to participate in artistic practice.
    There are many reasons or excuses that prevent these actors from meeting the audience: what program is inappropriate, there are problems with the singing style, the style is insufficient, the pronunciation is unclear, the theater is lacking, afraid that the audience will not welcome them... and so on. Just counting the very limited number of times these actors with solo talents have been on stage in seven years (it is said that this is the opera house's first solo concert) is astonishing.
    I admit that the above reasons are very worthy of attention, and every audience member strongly hopes that our singers will overcome their shortcomings, but should we let a swimmer practice on land all day long, or let him practice in the water?
    The situation of the audience not being able to buy tickets illustrates people's desire for music, and the actors' performance receiving enthusiastic support from the audience (almost every program had to be repeated, and some programs were even repeated three or four times) also illustrates their certain achievements in artistic creation. Like Zhang Quan's singing, which is simple, peaceful, and analytical; Lou Qian'gui's naturalness and intimacy; Zheng Xingli's stability and sincerity; Zou Dehua's liveliness and enthusiasm; Li Weibo's calmness and solidity; all show their advantages. Of course, these actors still have some shortcomings and deficiencies. However, the best way to overcome shortcomings and remedy deficiencies is to let them train on stage and give them opportunities to improve in practice.

    听歌随笔
    李凌
    一个朋友在电话上告诉我，说他们好些人想去听听“五四”以来的歌曲表演，问我有没有兴趣。并且说，票很难买。
    歌剧院的音乐会的确着重地介绍了一些“五四”以来的较好的歌曲，如“嘉陵江上”、“夜半歌声”、“教我如何不想他”、“茶山情歌”、“天伦歌”、“我住长江头”等。
    演员们对这些作品的演唱，是花了一番工夫的；大部分演员唱这些歌是久别重逢，有些却还是初次尝试。因此还不能说这一次的演唱都已经是很好的保留节目。但不少观众却是像遇见了故人一样，感到喜悦。
    好几年来，这些较好的节目，差不多在我们通常的音乐会上绝迹了。然而，有些演员却念念不忘，观众也不一定不想听。其所以少演、不演、或不敢演唱的原因，主要是“这些节目多半是诉述过去的痛苦生活和反映过去的时代的东西，没有什么现实意义”。
    当然，我们的演出应该时刻关心提高观众的社会主义认识和热情。人们需要直接地紧密地反映现实斗争生活的东西，也需要从反映过去的斗争生活的作品中获得知识和鼓励。
    欣赏过去的音乐，也有点像温习历史，我们了解旧社会的创伤，也就加深我们对于旧社会的认识，增进对今天幸福生活的热爱。一个很年青很年青的提琴手看了“夜半歌声”电影回来后说：“我今天又多知道一些前人的艰苦的处境了。”这不是很有意思吗？
    好些“五四”以来较好的歌曲，在风格上，是在努力捉摸如何更有独创性，更适合表现民族的生活、情感。许多歌曲紧密地反映了当时的时代感情。关于这一点，我不想多说。但有一点，那些优秀歌曲的曲调和语言、语意的结合，抒写心思的深刻是有它的独到之处。像“夜半歌声”中“在这漫漫的黑夜里，谁同我等待着天明”、“用什么来表我的愤怒，惟有那江涛的奔腾，用什么来慰你的寂寞，惟有这夜半歌声”等乐句的亲切深沉，“教我如何不想他”和“我住长江头”诗的意境的处理之细致入微，“天伦歌”的柔美、和谐；常常给人很深的印象。虽然这些歌曲的内容，有些还值得研究；但是，前一辈作曲者所着重注意的某些方面的深刻、独到的手法，也正是我们需要学习的好经验。这可能也是不少听众“念念不忘”的因素。
    许多人很满意地听到张权、楼乾贵、郑兴丽、邹德华、李维勃等在舞台造诣上日趋成熟的收获。但是，不能不使我想到，近几年来，我们具备了独唱、重唱才能的演员，参加艺术实践的机会是太少太少了。
    有着很多的原因或是理由，妨碍这些演员和观众见面：什么节目不适当啦，唱法有问题啦，风格不足啦，咬字不清啦，剧场缺乏啦，怕观众不欢迎啦……等等。只要算一算这些有独唱才能的演员，在七年中上舞台的很有限的次数（据说这还是歌剧院的第一次独唱会），是很惊人的。
    我承认上述那些原因是很值得注意的，每个观众都强烈地希望我们的演唱家克服自己的缺点，但是我们是让一个游泳家成天在陆地上练习，还是让他在水里练习好呢？
    观众买不到票的情况说明了人们对音乐的渴望，演员的表演在观众中获得热烈的拥戴（几乎每一节目都要重来，有几个节目甚至重来三、四次）也说明他们在艺术创造上的一定的成绩。像张权的歌唱，纯朴、宁静、富有分析力；楼乾贵的自然、亲切；郑兴丽的稳重、情真；邹德华的活泼、热情；李维勃的沉着、结实；都各各表现出他们的优点。当然，这些演员还有某些不足和缺点。然而，克服缺点和补救不足的最好方法，是让他们在舞台上锻炼，给他们在实践中提高。
