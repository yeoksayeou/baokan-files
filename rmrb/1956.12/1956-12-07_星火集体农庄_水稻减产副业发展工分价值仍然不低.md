Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 6th: Despite a significant reduction in rice production, the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Heilongjiang Province, has managed to maintain a relatively high work point value of 1.80 yuan per labor day, equivalent to the labor day income of a medium-sized agricultural cooperative, thanks to efforts to minimize grain losses and develop sideline production.

This year, the Xinghuo Collective Farm experienced widespread rice blast disease due to poor seed quality, leading to reduced yields. To facilitate spring plowing next year, some farmers initially proposed burning the severely affected rice paddies at the beginning of the autumn harvest. However, the Huachuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party told them that they should harvest every bit of grain possible. Therefore, the farmers harvested even the crops that yielded only a few hundred catties per hectare. During the harvest, heavy snow fell, and the farmers dug out the crops buried in the snow by hand, preventing further losses to the already reduced rice yield during the autumn harvest. Simultaneously with the autumn harvest, the farm also dispatched dozens of farmers to engage in various sideline productions such as hunting and fishing, which are estimated to generate an income of 100,000 yuan.

Having learned from this year's reduced production, the Xinghuo Collective Farm has begun to pay attention to selecting rice varieties. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, they went to other rice-producing areas in the province to look for good rice seeds and are preparing to disinfect the seeds brought in from other places with copper sulfate before storing them properly.

### 星火集体农庄　水稻减产副业发展工分价值仍然不低

　  星火集体农庄
　　水稻减产副业发展工分价值仍然不低
    新华社哈尔滨6日电　水稻严重减产的黑龙江省桦川县星火集体农庄，由于注意减少粮食损失，开展副业生产，今年每个劳动日仍然能收入一元八角，相当于一个中等农业社的劳动日收入。
    星火集体农庄今年因为种籽不良，水稻普遍发生稻热病而减产。为了便于明年春耕生产，秋收开始的时候，庄员们曾经提议将受灾严重的一部分稻田用火烧掉。但是中共桦川县委告诉他们，应该有一点粮食就收一点。于是庄员们就把这些每公顷只有几百斤收成的庄稼也收了回来。在收割中间下了大雪，庄员们就用手挖出埋在雪里的庄稼，使已经减产的水稻在秋收中没有再受到损失。和秋收同时，农庄又抽出几十个庄员展开狩猎和捕鱼等多种副业生产，估计可以收入十万元。
    接受了这次减产的教训以后，星火集体农庄开始注意选择稻种。他们在秋收开始的时候，就到省内其他水稻产区去物色好稻种，并且准备把从外地调来的稻种使用硫酸铜消毒，然后再妥善地保管起来。
