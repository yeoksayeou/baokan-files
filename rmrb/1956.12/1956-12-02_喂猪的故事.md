The Story of Feeding Pigs
By our reporter Gu Weijin

I

Since Feng Chaoxiong, the director and Party branch secretary of the Xinchun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Da? Township, successfully led the breeders in protecting the young pigs through the cold wave this spring and achieved success in spring plowing, and was subsequently elected as a special-class labor model of Huangpi County, a member of the County Political Consultative Conference, and a representative to the Hubei Provincial Labor Model Congress, he often pondered a question: His status was now different from the past, and he couldn't just stay in the cooperative all the time; he should strengthen external activities and expand his influence! As a result, he couldn't attend to many matters in the cooperative. Whenever members discussed issues with him, he would wave his hand and say:

"Well, you can handle these trivial matters within the cooperative yourselves. Don't bother me. I'm preparing to give a report at a meeting!"

One day, Feng Chaoxiong returned from a meeting outside, full of enthusiasm, only to hear that the 117 breeding pigs and sows in the cooperative were not doing well: some were very thin, some were sick, and some piglets died after birth. He was shocked and thought, "These breeding pigs are the foundation for developing pig production this year. If they are not fed well, how can I explain it to the county committee? And I'm still a labor model..." He hurried to the pigsty. Everything was as reported. He was angry and shouted at Chen Wenbo, the leader of the breeding group:

"What's the meaning of feeding the pigs so thinly and making them sick!"

Chen Wenbo was already somewhat dissatisfied with this job: five or six people were feeding over a hundred pigs, there was no collective experience in pig raising, and the leadership rarely cared. How could they do a good job? Now hearing Feng Chaoxiong's lecturing tone, he became angry and wanted to lash out, but after thinking about it, he held back his anger and said:

"Everyone has only raised one or two pigs in the past. Now we're feeding such a large group, we have no experience. What can we do?"

"There are ways, the question is whether you love public property."

"Hey! Who doesn't love public property? Everyone is busy day and night..."

"Forget it! Aren't those doing agricultural work busier than you? But you get the same pay as those doing agricultural work, and you still can't feed the pigs well. This is simply irresponsible!"

Chen Wenbo's neck bulged with veins, and he didn't speak for a long time. Feng Chaoxiong pouted and stormed out.

That night, Feng Chaoxiong convened a meeting of the cooperative's committee to discuss the pig feeding problem. The committee members were silent. After a while, Feng Chaoxiong broke the silence and said:

"Now the pigs are fed like this, everyone will be criticized if the superiors investigate. We should quickly think of a solution!" He swept his gaze around and said, "We must find a way to make the breeders responsible for their work!" Near midnight, Feng Chaoxiong summarized everyone's opinions and said:

"In order to urge the breeders to feed the pigs well, we require them to achieve the following three points: 1. Large pigs must gain 1.5 jin per day, medium pigs 1 jin, and small pigs 12 liang; 2. Sows must guarantee eight piglets per litter, and each piglet must grow to 13.5 jin in forty days; 3. Those who meet these conditions will be rewarded at the end of the year, and those who do not meet these conditions will have work points deducted monthly."

"Shouldn't we let them discuss these conditions so that they voluntarily accept them?" one committee member suggested.

"No need!" Feng Chaoxiong said confidently. "When the cooperative is large and there are many things to do, we can't let the people below discuss everything. Nothing will get done."

II

Ever since that quarrel with Feng Chaoxiong, Chen Wenbo had been feeling quite bad. This day, Chen Wenbo was calling everyone to feed the pigs when he suddenly heard the conditions required by the cooperative committee. He immediately became nervous and shouted loudly:

"These conditions are too harsh! Guarantee this, guarantee that, what can we use to guarantee them!"

"We'll just feed them, we don't care if they gain weight or not," one breeder said.

"That won't do," Chen Wenbo said. "If they don't gain the required weight, work points will be deducted."

Everyone stared blankly without speaking.

At this time, it was the spring famine, and Chen Wenbo, with his large family, was experiencing financial difficulties. He borrowed 1.5 yuan from the cooperative, which was spent in less than two days. He borrowed again, but the cooperative cadres refused and even scolded him. His family had not cooked for two days. He was starving and dizzy, so he had to eat cooked pig feed (broken rice) to fill his stomach. As he ate, he thought: the work is difficult, and life is also difficult. How can I live like this... To solve his current living problems, he planned to go out and do odd jobs.

Feng Chaoxiong was very angry when he heard this news and immediately ran to the pigsty. Chen Wenbo was packing his bedding. Feng Chaoxiong's face turned green with anger, and he shouted:

"What kind of thinking is this! Everyone is enthusiastically engaging in socialism, and you are pursuing personal gain. You are truly selfish, backward, and hopeless!"

"No matter what you say, I just can't do it anymore!"

"No!" Feng Chaoxiong said firmly. "We cannot approve of your selfish behavior!"

From that day on, Chen Wenbo's work morale plummeted. The others also had no motivation to work.

In March and April, many places near this township had swine fever, and some of the cooperative's piglets also became ill, with more than twenty dying. How anxious Feng Chaoxiong was! But Chen Wenbo and the others were still in a bad mood, complaining today that they couldn't do it, and complaining tomorrow that they wanted to leave. Feng Chaoxiong was very upset.

He decided to replace this group of breeders.

III

Zhang Yi, the director of the Rural Work Department of the Huangpi County Committee of the Communist Party of China, arrived. After understanding the pig-raising situation, he spoke with Feng Chaoxiong.

He first brought up the pig-feeding situation during the cold wave. This triggered deep memories for Feng Chaoxiong: It was a snowy spring night when the cold wave arrived. He remembered that the more than one hundred young breeding pigs that had just been purchased from outside the area were living in an unfinished pigsty. He was very worried and hurried to the pigsty to check. He saw a thick layer of snow covering the entrance to the pigsty. He woke up the breeders and some cooperative cadres to move the piglets to the cooperative committee's room overnight. He stayed there day and night, making fires to keep the piglets warm, cooking pig feed, and feeding them with the breeders. When he found that the piglets were not eating well, he and the breeders jointly researched giving the piglets something else to eat. When the Spring Festival arrived, the cold wave had not yet passed, and the breeders wanted to go home. He persuaded them that taking care of the piglets was the most important thing, bought wine and meat, and spent the Spring Festival with them. The breeders were very moved, and took care of all the piglets, safely weathering the cold wave. He received praise from the county committee and financial departments, and was successively elected as a special-class labor model, a member of the Political Consultative Conference, and a representative to the Huangpi County Committee of the Communist Party of China. Feng Chaoxiong recalled these things, feeling proud and honored, and a smile crept onto his face. Zhang Yi kindly and gently reminded him:

"During the cold wave, you led the pig feeding very diligently and deeply, sharing weal and woe with the masses. But after receiving the honorary titles of labor model, etc., how should you work?"

Feng Chaoxiong did not speak. Zhang Yi stared firmly at his face and continued, "After receiving honors, you forgot the working methods of the past."

Zhang Yi's words hit Feng Chaoxiong's weakness like an arrow. He calmly considered Zhang Yi's words, and his mind gradually cleared.

"That's right, I am not the same as I was during the cold wave! My work has become detached from everyone. I can't continue like this!..."

He first hired a veterinarian from the county to treat the piglets, then announced the cancellation of those unreasonable pig-feeding conditions, and personally ran to Chen Wenbo's home. He excitedly talked to Chen Wenbo about his own mistakes. Chen Wenbo looked at him in surprise. Later, he said softly:

"As for your family's living problems, in addition to temporarily giving you a loan of some money, the cooperative will also help you make arrangements for the whole year."

"How will you arrange it?"

"Your family has seven people, the old and the young. It's difficult to maintain a living relying solely on your income. The cooperative has decided to let your father feed a cow and two pigs on behalf of the cooperative, so that..."

"As long as my living problems are solved and those pig-feeding conditions are canceled, I won't have any ideological problems."

Chen Wenbo led the breeders in their work with enthusiasm. Feng Chaoxiong often appeared in the pigsty. He and the breeders researched and formulated various systems for piglet feeding management. He called on the breeders to learn from the pig-feeding experience of other places, and he mobilized Chen Wenbo to quickly learn and master epidemic prevention and treatment techniques.

The piglets were growing and breeding smoothly. In May and June, the number of piglets increased from more than one hundred to more than six hundred, and more than three hundred piglets could be bred in winter.

IV

Although it was the busy farming season, Feng Chaoxiong still took the time to go to the pigsty. This day, he was watching groups of pigs with great interest, considering the problems of feeding management, when Chen Wenbo came over and said:

"There are too many piglets, let's divide some of them to the members to feed themselves!"

Feng Chaoxiong did not speak. He thought that as the first advanced cooperative in the county being piloted by the county committee, many people would come to visit, and they should be shown large-scale collective pig raising. But if he divided some piglets to the members to feed, what would that look like! Feng Chaoxiong glanced at Chen Wenbo and replied in a different tone:

"If we divide the piglets to the members to feed, can they feed them well? I don't think so."

"The members have generally fed pigs before, and they can feed them well. Currently, the pigsties are not enough, and the feed problem is also difficult to solve. Dividing them to the members to feed can also help the members solve some family difficulties..."

"Hmm..." Feng Chaoxiong did not express his opinion and left.

At night, Chen Wenbo's words kept spinning in his mind. He tried to think of reasons to refute Chen Wenbo's words, but he couldn't think of any reasons.

It wasn't until Zhang Yi and work team leader Xie Xingwu had a conversation with him that he clearly realized that Chen Wenbo's opinion was based on facts and should be implemented.

Feng Chaoxiong convened a meeting of the cooperative committee and decided to divide some piglets to the members for private feeding.

To encourage the members to privately feed piglets, Feng Chaoxiong and the deputy director in charge of sideline production, Xu Caiyuan, and others went deep into the masses to understand their opinions and requirements for privately feeding piglets and formulated measures for privately feeding piglets: 1. Members who have difficulty with funds to buy pigs from the cooperative can buy on credit; 2. The cooperative is responsible for epidemic prevention and treatment for the members' piglets, and the treatment fee is paid by the cooperative on behalf of the members; members with financial difficulties can have the treatment fee paid from the public welfare fund; 3. The feed is uniformly supplied by the cooperative to avoid difficulties for members in purchasing feed individually; 4. The cooperative purchases pig manure and implements quality-based pricing; 5. One team affairs committee member with pig-feeding experience is selected from each production team to specifically guide the members in pig feeding and promptly report existing problems in pig feeding to the cooperative committee.

These measures were supported by the majority of the members. Based on the members' requirements, the cooperative distributed more than seventy piglets to the members for private feeding.

The members' enthusiasm for feeding pigs was very high. To save investment, they all used leftover rice, dishwater, melon rinds, and vegetable leaves to feed the pigs. The people responsible for feeding the pigs were semi-able-bodied people (old women, old men, etc.). The income from feeding pigs was very large. Feng Chaoxiong investigated the income of some pig-feeding households: a household that feeds two meat pigs a year can have a net income of 90 to 120 yuan. For example, Zhang Guocai has already sold one meat pig for forty yuan, and there is another meat pig that can be sold for more than seventy yuan during the Spring Festival. After deducting 7.5 yuan for buying bran, the net income will reach more than 100 yuan. As for members who feed sows, the income is even greater. The family of Feng Jiujiu, the deputy leader of sideline production, fed a sow in February. By August and September, it had already given birth to two litters of piglets. After deducting feed expenses, the net income was more than 200 yuan. Leaving two meat pigs, they could still sell more than 100 yuan. Adding the income from pig manure, the total income for the year would be 400 yuan, accounting for about half of the total annual income. All six members of the family made new clothes. This several hundred yuan of income was entirely earned by his old mother while simultaneously managing household affairs.

With large income from feeding pigs, more and more members were feeding pigs. By November, the number of piglets distributed by the cooperative to the members for private feeding had increased from more than seventy to three hundred. On average, each household fed at least one pig, and at most three or four.

Collective pig feeding also achieved success like private feeding by members. Based on the cooperative committee's opinion, Feng Chaoxiong went deep into the pigsty to call on the breeders to launch an advanced producer movement and announced reward measures for rationalization proposals. The breeders' morale was very high. They put forward rationalization proposals for collecting various alternative feeds. Based on this proposal, they could collect alternative feeds every month and make various fermented feeds. Collecting water chestnut vines as alternative feed was enough to feed all the pigs for half a year, and the cooperative could buy 70% less bran and broken rice, etc. They also proposed methods for accumulating fertilizer such as digging manure pits and rational suggestions for using pig manure mixed with green grass and lime to make fertilizer. Based on these suggestions, the fertilizer they accumulated every day increased from fertilizing one or two mu of land in the past to more than three mu.

V

October 12th was an unforgettable day for Feng Chaoxiong: The county party secretary, the county magistrate, and the person in charge of the animal husbandry section of the agricultural bureau came to their cooperative to hold an award ceremony for model pig-raising cooperatives. More than two hundred people, including the directors of agricultural cooperatives, party branch secretaries, and breeder representatives from all over the area, participated in this meeting. The pig-raising achievements of the Xinchun Cooperative were indeed great. By the end of the year, the number of pigs raised in the entire cooperative would increase from one hundred and seventeen in the spring to one thousand. Each household privately fed an average of more than two pigs, with a total income of more than 20,000 yuan. After deducting expenses such as buying breeding pigs and medicines in the spring, the net income was more than 14,000 yuan, accounting for more than 10% of the total annual agricultural and sideline income. The income from the members' private pig feeding generally accounted for more than 20% of the total annual income, and the income of some pig-feeding households even exceeded the agricultural dividends. Pig feeding and fertilizer accumulation also increased agricultural production. This year, they applied an average of 30% more fertilizer per mu of land than in the past.

At the meeting, County Party Secretary Gao Qicai announced on behalf of the county the awarding of the title of "Model Pig-Raising Cooperative" to their cooperative, and also presented many prizes. People all looked at Feng Chaoxiong with joyful eyes. And the most popular thing was hearing his experience report on pig raising over the past year – how to overcome subjectivism and learn the working methods of the mass line...

　　喂猪的故事
　　本报记者　古维进
　　一
    大?乡新春农业生产合作社社主任兼党支部书记冯超雄，自从今年春天领导饲养员保护小种猪安全渡过寒潮和领导春耕生产取得成绩、先后被选为黄陂县特等劳动模范、县政协委员和湖北省劳动模范代表大会代表等之后，心中时常考虑一个问题：现在自己的地位和过去不一样了，不能老是呆在社里，应该加强对外活动，扩大影响啊！于是社里有许多事情他顾不着管了，社员和他商量个什么问题，他总是把手一挥，说：
    “嗯，关于社内这些琐碎事情，你们自己去处理吧，莫来搅我，我正在准备出席一个会议做报告哪！”
    这天，冯超雄兴冲冲地从外面开会回来，听说社里喂的一百一十七头种猪和母猪没有长好：有的很瘦，有的生病，有的小猪生下来死掉了。他吃了一惊，想道：“这些种猪是今年发展生猪的依靠，现在喂得不好，怎样向县委交代？而且自己还是劳动模范……”他急急忙忙向猪圈走去，一切情况正如汇报所说的，他生气了，对着饲养组长陈文波嚷道：
      “把猪子喂得又瘦又病，像什么话！”
    陈文波本来对于干这个工作有点不满意：五六个人喂养一百多头猪，没有集体喂猪经验，领导上又很少过问，怎么干得了呢。现在听到冯超雄那种训人的口气，他火了，想跟他发作一顿，但想了一想，还是沉住气，说：
      “大家过去只喂过一、二头猪，现在喂那么一大群，没有经验，有什么办法呢。”
      “办法是有的，问题在于是不是爱护公共财产。”
      “嘿！谁不爱护公共财产？大家白天黑夜忙得团团转……”
      “算了！做农业的不比你们忙吗？可是，你们和做农业的得到同等的报酬，还不能把猪仔喂好，这简直是对工作不负责任！”
    陈文波气得脖子隆起了青筋，半天没说话，冯超雄噘着嘴气冲冲地出去了。
    夜里，冯超雄召开社务委员会讨论喂猪的问题。社委们沉闷闷地不说话。有一袋烟功夫，冯超雄打破沉寂说：
      “现在猪仔喂成这个样子，上级批评起来，每个人都有一份，应该赶快想办法啊！”他把视线往周围一扫，又说：“我们要想个办法使饲养员对工作负起责任！”将近深夜，冯超雄综合大家的意见说道：
    “为了督促饲养员把猪喂好，要求他们做到下面三点：一、大猪每天保证长一斤半，中猪长一斤，小猪长十二两；二、母猪一窝保证生小猪八个，每个小猪四十天保证长到十三斤半；三、达到这些条件的年终奖励，达不到这些条件的每月扣除工分。”
      “为了使他们自愿接受这些条件，还得让他们讨论讨论吧？”有的社委提议说。
      “用不着！”冯超雄很有把握地说。“社大了，事情多了，什么事都要让下面去讨论，什么事都会办不成。”
　  二
　　自从那天和冯超雄闹了一顿蹩扭，陈文波的心里挺不好受。这天，陈文波正在招呼大家喂猪，忽然听到社务委员会要求他们的那些条件，他立刻紧张起来，大声嚷道：
      “这些条件定得太苛刻了！这要保证，那要保证，拿什么去保证呢！”
      “我们只管喂，不管长斤不长斤。”有的饲养员说。
      “不行。”陈文波说，“长不到规定的斤数，还要扣除工分。”
    大家瞪着眼睛没说话。
    这时候正是春荒，家大口阔的陈文波，家庭生活发生了困难。他向社里借支了一元五角，不到两天花完了，他又向社里借支，社干部不答应，还把他训了一顿。他的家里有两天没有做饭，他饿得心里发慌，只好吃煮熟的猪食（碎米）充饥，他一边吃一边想：工作不好干，生活又困难，这日子怎么过下去呢……为了解决目前的生活问题，他打算出去做零工。
    冯超雄听到这个消息，非常恼火，立刻跑到猪舍里。陈文波正在卷铺盖。冯超雄气得脸孔发青，嚷道：
      “你这是什么思想！大家都在热烈地闹社会主义，你就在搞个人利益，真是自私、落后、没出息。”
      “不管你说什么，反正我是不能干了！”
      “不行！”冯超雄断然地说，“我们不能批准你这种自私的行为！”
    从这一天起，陈文波的工作情绪一落千丈。其他的人也没有情绪工作。
    3、4月间，这个乡附近有许多地方的猪仔发瘟，社里有些猪仔也生了病，有二十多头死掉了。冯超雄多么焦急呀！可是陈文波等还在闹情绪：今天嚷着干不了，明天嚷着要离开，冯超雄非常难过。
    他决定把这批饲养员换掉。
  　　三
　　中共黄陂县委农村工作部部长张怡如来了。他了解了养猪的情况，就找冯超雄谈话。
    他首先提起寒潮期间的喂猪情形。这引起了冯超雄的深深的回忆：是寒潮到来大雪纷飞的一个春夜，他想起才从外地购回的一百多头小种猪住在没有盖好的猪舍里，非常担心，连忙跑到猪舍去检查，只见猪圈门口复盖了一层厚雪。他叫醒饲养员和一些社干部连夜把小猪迁移到社务委员会的屋子。他昼夜没有离开这里，和饲养员一块给猪仔生火取暖、烧猪食、喂饲料，发觉猪仔吃得不好的时候，他和饲养员共同研究给猪仔吃点别的东西。春节到来，寒潮还没有过去，饲养员要回家了，他说服他们照顾猪仔要紧，买来酒肉和他们一块过春节。饲养员非常感动，照顾全部猪仔安全渡过寒潮。他得到县委和财经部门的表扬，先后被选为特等劳动模范、政协委员、中共黄陂县委党代表大会代表。……冯超雄想起这些，感到骄傲和光荣，一阵微笑爬上他的脸孔。张怡如和霭而亲切地提醒他说：
      “寒潮期间，你领导喂猪真是艰苦深入，与群众共甘苦，可是，获得劳动模范等荣誉称号之后，怎样工作呢？”
    冯超雄没有作声。张怡如牢牢地凝视他的脸孔，继续说：“获得荣誉之后，把过去的工作方法忘记了。”
    张怡如的话像箭一样的射中了冯超雄的要害。他冷静地考虑张怡如的话，脑子渐渐清醒起来。
      “不错，我现在不是寒潮期间的我了！我的工作脱离了大家，不能这样下去啊！……”
    他首先到县里聘请兽医给猪仔治病，然后宣布取消那些不合理的喂猪条件，又亲自跑到陈文波的家里。他激动地给陈文波谈到自己的不对。陈文波惊喜地望着他。后来，他柔和地说：
    “至于你的家庭生活问题，社里除了暂时给你支借一部分钱外，还要帮助你作全年的安排”。
      “怎样安排呢？”
      “你家有七口人，老的老小的小，光靠你一个人的收入，维持生活有困难，社里决定让你爸代社喂一头牛、二头猪，这样……”
      “只要解决了我的生活问题，和取消那些喂猪条件，我一点思想问题没有。”
    陈文波热情充沛地领导饲养员进行工作了。冯超雄常常出现在猪舍里。他和饲养员研究和制定关于猪仔饲养管理的各种制度，他号召饲养员学习外地喂猪的经验，他动员陈文波迅速学会掌握防疫治疗技术。
    猪仔在顺利地生长繁殖，五六月间，猪仔由一百多头发展到六百多头，冬季还可繁殖小猪三百多头。
　　　　四
　  虽然是农忙季节，冯超雄还是抽时间到猪舍去。这天，他正在兴致勃勃地看着一群一群的猪子，考虑着饲养管理的问题，陈文波过来说道：
      “猪仔太多了，分出一部分给社员自己喂吧！”
    冯超雄没有作声。他想作为一个县委在全县试办的第一个高级社，来参观的人是很多的，应该让他们看一看大规模集体喂猪。可是，如果分出一部分猪仔给社员喂，这像什么话呢！……冯超雄瞟了陈文波一眼，用另一种口气答道：
      “把猪仔分给社员喂，他们能喂好吗？不见得。”
      “社员一般都喂过猪的，能把猪喂好。目前猪圈不够用了，饲料问题也不好解决，分给社员喂，还能帮助社员解决一些家庭困难……”
      “嗯……”冯超雄没有表示意见，出去了。
    夜里，陈文波的话不断在他的脑子里打转，他企图想出理由驳倒陈文波的话，可是，想不出什么理由。
    直到张怡如和工作组长谢醒吾和他作了一次谈话，他才明确认识陈文波的这个意见是实事求是的，应该实行。
    冯超雄召开社务委员会会议，决定分出一部分猪仔给社员私喂。
    为了鼓励社员私喂猪仔，冯超雄和副业主任徐才元等深入群众了解他们对于私喂猪仔的意见和要求，制定了私喂猪仔的办法：一、社员向社买猪资金困难的，可以赊账；二、社里负责给社员的猪仔进行防疫治疗，治疗费由社代垫；社员经济困难的，治疗费由公积金里开支；三、饲料由社里统一供应，以免社员个人购买饲料困难；四、社里收购猪粪，实行按质论价；五、每个生产队的队务委员里，抽出一个有喂猪经验的人具体指导社员喂猪，并向社务委员会及时反映喂猪存在的问题。
    这个办法得到广大社员的拥护。根据社员的要求，社里分出七十多头猪仔给社员私喂。
    社员的喂猪情绪很高。为了节约投资，他们都用剩饭、洗锅水、瓜皮、菜叶等喂猪，担负喂猪的人都是半劳力（老婆婆、老汉等）。喂猪收入很大。冯超雄调查了一些喂猪户的收入情况：一户一年喂二头肉猪，可以净收入九十到一百二十元。比方张国才喂了一头肉猪已经卖得四十元，还有一头肉猪，春节可以卖到七十多元。除去买糠七元五角，纯收入将达百元以上。至于社员喂母猪的，收入更大。副业队长冯九九家2月喂了一头母猪，到了8、9月间，已经生了二窝小猪，除去饲料开支外，纯收入二百多元，留下二口肉猪，还能卖一百多元，加上猪粪的收入，全年将要收入四百元，约占全年总收入的一半。一家六口都做了新衣裳。这几百元的收入，完全是依靠他的老母亲在兼管家务的情况下挣来的。
    喂猪收入大，社员喂猪的越来越多。到了11月间，社里分给社员私喂的猪仔由过去的七十多头增加到三百头了。平均每户最少喂猪一头，最多达三、四头。
    集体喂猪也和社员私喂猪一样取得了成绩。冯超雄根据社务委员会的意见，深入猪舍号召饲养员开展先进生产者运动，宣布对合理化建议的奖励办法。饲养员的情绪非常高涨，他们提出了采集各种代饲品的合理化建议。根据这个建议，他们每个月都可以采集代饲品，制成多种发酵饲料。采集菱角藤代饲品足供全部猪子吃半年，社里可以少买70％的糠和碎米等。他们还提出挖粪池等积肥办法和利用猪粪混合青草、石灰等制造肥料的合理建议。根据这些建议，他们每天积的肥料要由过去肥田一、二亩增加到三亩多。……
　　五
    10月12日，这是冯超雄难忘的一天：县委书记、县长、农业局畜牧科的负责人来到他们的社里举行一个饲养生猪模范社授奖大会，各地农业社社主任、党支部书记、饲养员代表等二百多人参加了这个大会。新春社养猪成绩确是很大，到年底前后全社养猪将由春天的一百一十七头增加到一千头，每户平均私喂猪二头多，总共收益二万元以上。除去春天购买种猪药械等开支，纯收益一万四千多元，占全年农副业总收入10％以上。社员私人喂猪的收入一般也占全年收入20％以上，有的喂猪户的收入还超过农业分红。喂猪积肥还使农业增产。今年他们每亩田平均比过去多施肥30％以上。
    会上，县委书记高起才代表县里宣布授予他们社里“饲养生猪模范社”的称号，还赠送了许多奖品。人们都用喜悦的眼光望着冯超雄。而最受人们欢迎的还是听到他一年来饲养生猪的经验报告——怎样克服主观主义，学会群众路线的工作方法。……
