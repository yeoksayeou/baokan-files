Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 24th – The Politburo of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement today, calling on the people of the whole country to unite, assist the government in resolving the Central Sumatra and North Sumatra incidents, and resolutely oppose the anti-democratic and anti-constitutional actions of Hussein and Simbolon.

The statement pointed out that the Central Sumatra and North Sumatra incidents are one of the forms of implementation of Colonel Lubis's plan to seize power. After Lubis and others failed in their actions to seize central power to establish a central military government, they attempted, with the support of reactionary political forces, and have already implemented, seizing local power and then establishing local military governments.

The statement believes that these actions were orchestrated by some leaders of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party, with the aim of overthrowing the Sastroamidjojo cabinet and establishing an anti-democratic government. With the emergence of local military governments like those in Central Sumatra and North Sumatra, some leaders of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party will use this to force the Sastroamidjojo government and the Supreme Command to comply with them. The statement pointed out that the policy of opposing colonialism and the policy of opposing the reactionary bandit gang of "Darul Islam" must be coordinated with the actions of opposing domestic anti-democratic and anti-people warlords.

The Indonesian Communist Party calls on the Indonesian government and state power organs to take corresponding steps quickly regarding the abnormal situation created by the rebels. The statement said that the government's taking swift and correct steps is fully in line with the government program agreed to by the parliament.

The statement finally called for consolidating the unity of all democratic forces in the country, opposing division, and being vigilant against the interference of Dutch colonialists and American imperialists.

    印度尼西亚共产党号召人民协助政府解决苏门答腊事件
    巩固团结警惕荷兰和美国的干预
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚共产党政治局今天发表声明，号召全国人民团结起来，协助政府解决中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊事件，坚决反对侯赛尼和西姆波朗的反民主、反宪法的行动。
    声明指出，中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊事件是卢比斯上校抢夺政权计划的实施形式之一。卢比斯等在夺取中央政权以成立中央军政府的行动失败之后，又在反动的政治力量的支持下企图并且已经实行夺取地方政权，进而成立地方军政府。
    声明认为，这些行动是马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党的一部分领袖导演的，其目的在于推翻沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁而成立反民主的政府。由于出现了像在中苏门答腊和北苏门答腊那样的地方军政府，马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党的一部分领袖将借此来逼迫沙斯特罗阿米佐约政府和最高统帅部顺从他们。声明指出，反对殖民主义的政策和反对“印度尼西亚伊斯兰军”反动匪帮的政策，必须同反对国内反民主和反人民的军阀的行动配合起来。
    印度尼西亚共产党呼吁印度尼西亚政府和国家权力机构对叛变者所制造的不正常情势迅速地采取相应的步骤。声明说，政府采取迅速和正确的步骤是完全符合为国会所同意的政府纲领的。
    声明最后号召巩固国内一切民主力量的团结，反对分裂，警惕荷兰殖民主义者和美帝国主义者的干预。
