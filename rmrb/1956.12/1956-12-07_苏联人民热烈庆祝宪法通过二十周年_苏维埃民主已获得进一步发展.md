Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th dispatch from TASS: December 5th marked the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Soviet Constitution. Working people throughout the Soviet Union held gatherings, exhibitions, and other activities to celebrate this holiday.

On this day, working people and intellectuals in Moscow held a grand evening party and song and dance performances in the Central Auditorium of the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge. Festive sports competitions were held in various stadiums in Moscow. In Frunze, the capital of the Kyrgyz Republic, working people held celebrations in various clubs and cultural palaces, as well as competitions for outstanding athletes of the republic. Many exhibitions introducing the achievements of the republic were also held in other capital cities of the union republics.

"Pravda" published an editorial on the 5th to celebrate the Soviet Constitution Day. The editorial pointed out that the Soviet Constitution is a summary of the glorious path of struggle and victory that the Soviet people have traversed under the leadership of the Communist Party. For twenty years, the Soviet Constitution has demonstrated its great vitality and thorough socialist democracy. Unlike the hypocritical and incomplete democracy of capitalist countries, Soviet socialist democracy is the democracy of the working people, the democracy of the people. The Soviet system attracts millions of people to consciously manage the country and actively participate in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.

The editorial wrote: The Party is making every effort to promote socialist democracy. The Party resolutely struggles against all acts that undermine socialist democracy and fail to comply with the norms and provisions of the Soviet Constitution. The Party and the government are implementing various measures to expand the rights and powers of the union republics, strictly abide by the rule of law, change planning work to improve local initiative, strengthen the activities of local Soviets, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. All of this proves that Soviet democracy has achieved further development.

However, all this does not mean that we have no shortcomings in the practical realization of the principles of Soviet democracy. Despite some major measures taken in recent years, our state institutions are still large, and some state officials still have bureaucracy and procrastination, are detached from living things, and detached from the people. There are also some facts showing that these people ignore the needs of the people. The task is to resolutely improve the work of the Soviets and our state organs, and strengthen their ties with the masses.

　　苏联人民热烈庆祝宪法通过二十周年
　　苏维埃民主已获得进一步发展
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：12月5日是苏联宪法通过二十周年纪念日。苏联各地的劳动人民举行了集会、展览会和其他活动来庆祝这个节日。
    在这一天，莫斯科的劳动人民和知识分子在全苏政治和科学知识普及协会中央大礼堂举行了盛大的晚会和歌舞演出。莫斯科的各个运动场上举行了庆祝节日的体育比赛。在吉尔吉斯共和国首都伏龙芝，劳动人民在各俱乐部和文化宫举行了庆祝节日的集会，此外还举行了共和国优秀运动员的比赛。在其他加盟共和国首都，也举办了许多介绍共和国成就的展览会。
      “真理报”在5日发表了庆祝苏联宪法节的社论。社论指出，苏联宪法是苏联人民在共产党领导下所走过的光荣的斗争和胜利道路的总结。二十年来，苏联宪法一直表现出它的伟大生命力量和彻底的社会主义民主性。与资本主义国家那种虚伪的、残缺不全的民主不同，苏维埃社会主义民主是劳动者的民主、人民的民主。苏维埃制度吸引着千百万人民自觉地管理国家，积极地参加政治、经济和文化方面一切部门的生活。
    社论写道：党正在全力发扬社会主义民主。党坚决同一切破坏社会主义民主的行为、不遵守苏联宪法的准则和条款的行为作斗争。党和政府正在实行各种措施以扩大加盟共和国的权利和职权、严格遵守法制、改变计划工作来提高地方的主动性、加强地方苏维埃的活动、开展批评与自我批评，这一切都证明了苏维埃民主已经获得了进一步的发展。
    但是，所有这些决不意味着我们在实际实现苏维埃民主的原则上没有缺点。尽管近几年来采取了一些重大措施，我们的国家机构依然还是庞大的，在国家机关工作人员中还有一些具有官僚主义和拖沓作风、脱离生动的事物、脱离人民的人。也有一些事实表明这些人忽视人民的需要。任务就是坚决改进苏维埃、我们国家机构的工作，加强它们与群众的联系。
