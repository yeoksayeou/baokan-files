　　Mother Wang came out of the kitchen and looked up at the sky, which was terribly gloomy. Before she even reached the door, she heard her husband and son arguing.

　　“You're embarrassing your father! You only care about being an advanced producer yourself!”

　　Her son said something in a low voice, which made the father even angrier: "Don't make excuses for yourself! To say nothing of the others, why is it that Li and Zhao, who work on the same lathe as you, can't complete their plans for months? Why don't you tell them your experience? Tell me, speak up!"

　　Mother Wang's heart skipped a beat. What's wrong with the old man tonight? Suddenly, a flash of lightning ripped through the black night sky, and with a deafening clap of thunder, a torrential downpour poured down. At that moment, the door suddenly opened, and Wang Guohua hurried out into the rain.

　　Mother Wang didn't even have time to stop him and rushed into the house to scold her husband:

　　"Aren't you celebrating your birthday tonight? Look how you've pushed your son..."

　　Master Wang didn't answer Mother Wang, but handed her an umbrella: "Here, take this to Guohua!" Mother Wang took the umbrella, not even bothering to change her cloth shoes, and chased after him into the rain.

　　When Wang Guohua saw his mother coming, he stood under a tree and waited. Mother Wang caught up and felt her son's clothes, saying, "Tsk, tsk, you're soaked to the bone!" Mother Wang told her son to go home: "Your father is stubborn, he'll be better in a while, with me here, he can't be arrogant!"

　　Wang Guohua said to his mother: "Guohua isn't your good son..." Mother Wang smoothed her son's wet hair and comforted him: "No, Mom doesn't see you that way..." Wang Guohua interrupted his mother: "Mom, take the umbrella and go home, my clothes are already wet anyway, let me go back to the dormitory alone and think about it, that way, I'll feel better..."

　　Wang Guohua walked into the rain without looking back, and Mother Wang didn't force him to stay, she knew that her son was also stubborn.

　　From then on, the father and son didn't talk much. When Wang Guohua had something to tell his father, he would always go around and ask his mother to say it. When Master Wang bought something good to eat, he would always pretend not to care and say to Mother Wang: "Keep these peanuts for him, they're newly on the market."

　　One day, just after finishing dinner, Master Wang wiped his mustache and was about to talk to his son when Li and Zhao, who worked with Wang Guohua on the same lathe, invited Wang Guohua away. They walked and talked and laughed. Master Wang squinted his eyes and asked himself: "Is Guohua changing?" He was still worried, so he circled around, following them, to see what his son and Li and Zhao were up to.

　　After circling twice, Master Wang stopped in front of a bamboo fence. He looked through the gaps in the fence and saw Guohua and Li and Zhao squatting on the ground talking softly, holding something in their hands. Looking closely, his son was molding yellow mud! He was molding a tool holder model. Master Wang happily thought: "He's changing, he's changing!" He was about to turn around and go home when he suddenly heard his son say: "This knife was modified by my father based on advanced Soviet experience, its characteristic is..."

　　"Is it all coming back to me?" Master Wang stood still, thinking with surprise: "Is this little devil really revealing all his family secrets?"

　　Wang Guohua took a yellow mud knife and said to Li and Zhao:

　　"This knife is best for machining large workpieces, it can cut deep and move fast, and it can machine the end face and the flat surface well in one pass."

　　"What is the angle of the knife?"

　　"Seventy-five degrees."

　　"Oh no!" Master Wang scratched the back of his head uneasily, thinking: "This kid really is something! It's clearly sixty-five degrees, how did he remember it as seventy-five degrees!"

　　Wang Guohua continued to say to the two young men:

　　"The geometry of this seventy-five degree knife is based on scientific principles, and when grinding this seventy-five degree knife, you should hold the knife like this." Wang Guohua held Li's hand and taught him.

　　"Oh no, oh no," Master Wang said anxiously, and couldn't help but blurt out: "That's not right!..."

　　"Who's there?" the three young men asked in unison. Master Wang was very embarrassed and stammered: "Me, are you guys playing? Okay, okay, you play." He hurried away.

　　Another day, after work, Master Wang took a micrometer and walked around the workshop, heading towards the lathe where his son worked. Wang Guohua was quick-eyed, and when he saw his father coming, he quickly squatted behind the lathe; pretending to measure the workpiece. He winked at Li, who was operating the lathe.

　　Master Wang walked over and measured the workpiece with a micrometer and asked, "Did you meet the quota?"

　　"We did!" Li's cheerful big eyes darted around.

　　"Hmm, the quality is very good, what kind of knife did you use?" Master Wang asked again.

　　"Ah, this is the knife you improved the angle on."

　　"I improved it?" Master Wang carefully touched the blade and frowned, saying, "That's not right, the blade I improved isn't this wide?"

　　"This..." Li had never told a lie, and he was speechless and couldn't answer. Master Wang looked at the blade and the machined workpiece carefully for a while, and nodded repeatedly: "This knife isn't bad!"

　　"Yes," hearing this, Li felt relieved and chuckled, saying, "This knife was your suggestion, Wang Guohua and us studied it many times and modified it! Now it's really easy to machine, two cuts and it's done, one roughing cut, one finishing cut, whoosh - and it's done!"

　　"Hmm, good, good," Master Wang touched the tip of the knife, as if he had met an old friend he hadn't seen for many years and was reluctant to let go: "Everyone has more ideas, more people mean better solutions." Master Wang pushed the glasses that had slipped down the bridge of his nose up and stroked his mustache and left. After walking a few steps, he turned back to Li and said: "If you see Guohua, tell him to come home for dinner earlier."

　　It was completely dark when Master Wang returned home, handing Mother Wang a bundle of noodles, a bottle of wine and a packet of braised food, saying: "Make it, today is my birthday."

　　"Celebrating your birthday?" Mother Wang was surprised: "Didn't you just have your birthday, what new tricks are you up to?"

　　While Mother Wang was cooking in the kitchen, she heard laughter coming from the living room. She walked to the window and listened, only to hear the old man ask his son:

　　"You're not angry with me anymore, are you? Let's have a drink tonight."

　　The son chuckled: "Who's angry with you, it was all a moment of confusion on my part."

　　Mother Wang covered her mouth and chuckled, thinking: What are these two up to!

    父子俩
    翟航
    王大娘从厨房里出来，仰脸望了望天，天阴得可怕。她还没有走到房门口，就听见她的丈夫和她儿子的吵架声。
    “给你老子丢人！光顾自己当先进生产者啦！”
    儿子小声地说了几句什么，父亲的气更大了：“你不要为自己找理由！别的不说，和你同在一部床子工作的小李和小赵为什么几个月完不成计划呢？你为什么不把经验告诉他们呢？你说，说呀！”
    大娘的心跳起来。老头子今晚怎么啦？忽然，一道闪电划破了黑色的夜空，随着震耳的雷声，倾盆大雨哗哗地倒下来。这时，门突然推开，王国华匆匆地向雨中走去。
    大娘连挡一下都没来得及，连忙跑进屋数落起她丈夫来：
    “你今晚不过生日啦？看你把儿子逼的……”
    王师傅没有回答大娘的话，递给她一把雨伞：“喏，给国华送去吧！”大娘接过雨伞，连布鞋也没顾换，就向雨中撵去。
    王国华见妈赶来了，就站在树下等着。大娘赶上前去摸摸儿子的衣服说：“啧啧，浑身上下湿透啦！”大娘叫她儿子回家去：“你父亲是个牛脾气，过一阵就好啦，有我在，他别神气！”
    王国华对妈妈说：“国华不是你的好儿子……”大娘理了理儿子湿淋淋的头发，安慰他：“不，妈妈不这样看你，……”王国华打断妈妈的话：“妈妈，你打伞回家吧，我衣服反正已经淋湿了，你让我一个人回到单身宿舍好好想一想，这样，我痛快些……”
    王国华头也不回就向雨中走去，大娘没有强拉他，她知道自己儿子也是个牛脾气。
    从此后，父子俩都不大说话了。王国华有什么事要告诉父亲的，总拐个弯，叫妈妈去说。王师傅买了什么好吃的，总装作不在意的样子向大娘说：“这花生给他留着吧，是新上市的。”
    一天，刚刚吃罢晚饭，王师傅抹抹胡子，正准备和儿子谈谈，忽然和王国华在一部床子上干活的小李和小赵把王国华邀走了。他们一路走一路谈笑。王师傅眯缝着眼自己问自己：“国华在改啦？”他还放心不下，就绕着圈子，跟着他们走，看看儿子和小李小赵搞什么。
    绕了两个圈子，王师傅在一道竹篱笆前停住了。他隔着篱笆空隙望过去，只见国华和小李小赵蹲在地上轻轻地谈着话，手里捏着什么。仔细一望，儿子在捏黄泥巴！捏的是刀架模型。王师傅高兴地想：“改啦，改啦！”他正要转身回家，忽然听见儿子说：“这把刀子是我爸爸根据苏联先进经验改的，它的特点是……”
    “闹到我头上来啦？”王师傅立住脚，惊喜地想：“这小鬼真的把全部家当都抖落出来啦？”
    王国华拿了把黄泥巴刀子向小李小赵说：
    “这刀子车大活最好，能深刀快走，又能一次车好端面和平面。”
    “刀子的角度是多少？”
    “七十五度。”
    “糟啦！”王师傅不安地直搔后脑壳想：这孩子真是！明明是六十五度，他怎么记成七十五度呢！”
    王国华继续和两个小伙子说：
    “这七十五度刀子的几何形状，是有科学根据的，在磨这七十五度刀子时，应该这么拿刀子。”王国华把着小李的手在教他。
    “糟啦，糟啦，”王师傅心一急，不觉嚷了一句：“不对！……”
    “谁？”三个小伙子同声地问。王师傅弄得很窘，结结巴巴地说：“我，你们在耍呀？好吧，好吧，你们耍。”他赶忙走开了。
    又一天下了班，王师傅拿了一个分厘卡，在车间里转了一圈，向他儿子工作的那部床子走去，王国华眼快，一见父亲来了，连忙蹲在车床的后面；假装量活。他向正在开车的小李挤挤眼。
    王师傅走过来用分厘卡量量活问：“达到定额了？”
    “达到啦！”小李愉快的大眼睛四面直转。
    “嗯，质量很好，用的什么刀子？”王师傅又问了一句。
    “啊，这是用你改进角度的那把刀。”
    “我改进的？”王师傅仔细地摸摸刀刃，皱皱眉说：“不对吧？我改进的刀刃那有这么宽？”
    “这……”小李从来没说过谎，这一下张嘴结舌答不上来。王师傅又认真地看了一阵刀刃和车好的活，连连点点头：“这刀子不坏呀！”
    “是呀，”听了后面这句话，小李心放宽了，嘿嘿地笑着说：“这刀子是你提的建议，王国华和我们又研究好多次，把它改啦！现在车活真安逸，两刀成功，一刀毛，一刀光，嗤啦——一下，就车好啦！”
    “嗯，好，好，”王师傅摸着刀尖，好像遇着多年不见的老朋友拉着手不肯放一样：“大家的主意多，人多办法就是好。”王师傅把滑落在鼻尖上的眼镜往上托托，摸摸胡子就走了。没走几步，又回转身对小李说：“你若见着国华，叫他早一点回家吃晚饭。”
    天已经完全黑了，王师傅才回家，递给大娘一把面条，一瓶酒和一包卤菜说：“拿去做吧，今天是我做生日。”
    “做生日？”王大娘奇怪了：“你不是才过的生日吗，又出些啥花样？”
    大娘在厨房做饭的时候，听到住屋传来了笑声，她走到窗前听了听，只听见老头子问儿子：
    “不生我的气了吧？今晚我们俩来喝一杯。”
    儿子嘿嘿地笑着：“谁生您的气，这都是我一时糊涂。”
    大娘捂着嘴吃吃地笑起来，心想：这父子俩还搞啥名堂哟！
