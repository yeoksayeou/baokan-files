    It's Not Difficult to Invite Art Workers

    The People's Daily published an article by Comrade Ren Jiaji on August 22 entitled "It's Really Difficult to Invite Artists." Judging from what the article says, it does seem somewhat "difficult" to invite artists, but that's a one-sided view, and the real situation isn't like that.

    On July 25, the day of the pre-exhibition of the "Beijing Arts and Crafts Exhibition," the arts and crafts workers who received the so-called "mimeographed invitation" from the exhibition organizers (Beijing Arts and Crafts Production Cooperative Union) all went to visit. However, the invitation didn't mention anything about an "artists' forum" being held at the same time as the pre-exhibition. People visited from morning to night, and left successively after the visit. Many people from the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts and the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts also went to visit that day, but many were turned away because they weren't "invited," and it took a lot of persuasion to get in. Comrade Ren Jiaji's criticism that not a single artist attended the "artists' forum" that day is completely unfounded.

    At the end of July, on the day the exhibition organizers convened the forum "again," it happened to be the opening of the "Mexican Art Exhibition," and many artists went to attend the opening ceremony. Moreover, among the artists invited to the forum, very few were actually engaged in arts and crafts work. For example, the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts, which has one or two dozen art cadres, only received two invitations, and those who went with the invitations were the two who Comrade Ren Jiaji criticized in his article for only having two people arrive, who were "belatedly arriving" due to a sudden rainstorm.

    Comrade Ren Jiaji's discussion of the cooperation between veteran special arts and crafts artists and arts and crafts workers over the past few years also doesn't align with the facts. He simply understands this "cooperation" as "stepping into the production workshop." Even so, it can't be said that only "one professor" has "stepped into the production workshop" over the past few years. People shouldn't forget that a few years ago, in order to facilitate "cooperation," the ivory carving "production workshop" was set up in the Academy of Fine Arts.

    Comrade Ren Jiaji also talks about the situation of the art worker who was "assigned" to accompany the veteran artist, which also differs greatly from the facts. The fact is: when the National Embroidery Conference was held in March this year, the Hunan Xiang Embroidery Cooperative requested the Central Handicraft Bureau to organize art workers to help improve Xiang Embroidery. The Art Service Department accepted this invitation and sent this art cadre who studies embroidery. At the same time, an ivory carving veteran artist was also going to Hunan to experience life, so this art cadre was asked to accompany the ivory carving veteran artist so as to take care of the veteran artist on the way. Since the task of this art cadre was to study embroidery, then when he arrived at his destination with the ivory carving veteran artist, he would naturally go to study embroidery himself. Comrade Ren Jiaji's complaint that "this art worker only stayed in the local area for one day and left the veteran artist to do his own research work" is clearly indiscriminate.

    It is the duty of arts and crafts workers to help veteran artists create, and they shouldn't need to be "invited," but should do so enthusiastically and proactively (and this is exactly the case). Comrade Ren Jiaji also mentioned in his article that after the Beijing Special Handicraft Industry was cooperativized, several product observation exhibitions were held, but very few artists came to guide. This is also not very consistent with the facts. It is true that there are several art units in Beijing, which concentrate a large number of artists, but no artist is omnipotent in all art businesses. Artists engaged in arts and crafts are only a minority among them. We cannot require all artists to participate in arts and crafts activities and must attend any exhibition and meeting when invited. Moreover, many of them also hold leadership positions in art groups and art schools, or are engaged in teaching and administrative work, and often have to participate in some social activities. These artists have long suffered from "not attending to their proper duties." As for arts and crafts workers, they always participate in any exhibition related to arts and crafts, and even try to see them even if they are not invited, as mentioned above. Unfortunately, some units often only see those art "specialists" who hold leadership positions in art groups and art schools, and do not see the art "workers" who are engaged in specific work. And the "specialists" in their minds are indeed very few. I think that arts and crafts workers will never feel "disrespectful" because of "mimeographed invitations," and arts and crafts cooperatives don't need to spend extravagantly and prepare banquets to entertain them, which should be said to be very vulgar.

    Our arts and crafts industry is still very young, and its strength is still very weak. We need close unity and cooperation between veteran artists and arts and crafts workers, as well as strong support and collaboration from all parties. There are many problems and shortcomings in our work, and we welcome any sharp criticism and opinions that are realistic and can improve our work. Yao Man

### 美术工作者不难请

专栏：对批评的反应

    美术工作者不难请
    人民日报在8月22日登载了任家骥同志的文章“美术家真难请”。就文章所说的那样来看，美术家确乎有些“难请”，然而，那是片面的说法，真实的情况不是那样。
    7月25日“北京工艺美术品展览会”预展那天，收到展览会主办单位（北京市工艺美术品生产合作社联合社）所发所谓“油印请柬”的工艺美术工作者，是都去参观了的，但是请柬上根本没有说预展同时还要举行什么“艺人座谈会”，前去参观的人从早到晚都有，参观完毕也就陆续走了。中央工艺美术科学研究所和中央工艺美术学院的人员，那天也曾有不少人先后前往参观，多因未在被“请”之列，而拒之门外，有些费去了不少唇舌，才得入场。任家骥同志批评美术家这一天一个也没有参加“艺人座谈会”，是毫无根据的。
    7月底，展览会主办单位“再次”召集座谈会的那天，恰巧“墨西哥艺术展览会”开幕，不少美术家都参加开幕式去了，况且，座谈会邀请的美术家中，真正搞工艺美术工作的只很少几人，例如有着一、二十个美术干部的中央工艺美术科学研究所，就仅仅接到两张请柬，持柬前往者，正是任家骥同志文章中批评他们只到了两位的，因途中突遇大雨而“姗姗来迟”的那两位。
    任家骥同志谈到关于几年来特艺老艺人和工艺美术工作者合作的情况，也不符合事实。他把这种“合作”，只简单地理解为“跨进生产车间”。即使这样，那也不能说几年来“跨进生产车间”的只有“教授一人”。人们当不致遗忘，几年前为了便利“合作”，曾把牙雕“生产车间”设在美术学院里。
    任家骥同志还谈到那位被“派”与老艺人同行的美术工作者的情况，同事实也颇有出入。事实是：今年3月间开全国刺绣会议时，湖南湘绣联社曾要求中央手工业管理局组织美术工作者帮助改进湘绣，美术服务部接受了这个约请，就派了这位研究刺绣的美术干部去。与此同时，有位牙雕老艺人也要到湖南去体验生活，就让这位美术干部和牙雕老艺人同行，以便在途中对老艺人有所照顾。这位美术干部的任务既是研究刺绣，那末当他同牙雕老艺人抵达目的地后，当然要径自去研究刺绣了。任家骥同志埋怨“这位美术工作者只在当地逗留一天就离开了老艺人，搞自己的研究工作去了”，显然是不分青红皂白的。
    工艺美术工作者帮助老艺人创作，是分内的事，他们应当用不到“请”，而是热情主动地做（事实也正如此）。任家骥同志文中还提到，北京市特种手工艺合作化后，开过几次产品观摩展览会，光临指导的美术家寥寥无几。这也是不很符合事实的。不错，北京是有好几个美术单位，集中了大批美术家，但是任何一位美术家对于各项美术业务并非万能的，搞工艺美术的美术家只不过是其中的少数，我们不能要求所有的美术家都必须参加工艺美术活动，任何展览和会议，都必须有请必到。而且他们有好些兼着美术团体和美术学校的领导工作，或者担任教学工作和行政工作还经常要参加一些社会活动，这些美术家们都早已苦于“不务正业”了。至于工艺美术工作者们，则是对于任何有关工艺美术的展览，从来都是一定参加的，甚至像上述那样，即使没有被请，也要争取去看看。可惜某些单位，往往只看见那些担任美术团体和美术学校的领导工作的美术“家”，而不大看得见从事具体工作的美术工作“者”。而他们心目中的“家”，确是寥寥无几的。我想工艺美术工作者决不会因为“油印请柬”而感到“不恭敬”，工艺美术品联社也不必大肆铺张、准备酒席招待，那应该说是十分庸俗的。
    我们的工艺美术事业还很年轻，力量还非常薄弱，我们需要老艺人和工艺美术工作者紧密的团结合作，也需要各方面有力的支持和协作。我们工作中存在的问题和缺点是很多的，我们欢迎实事求是的、能够改善工作的任何尖锐的批评和意见。　姚曼
