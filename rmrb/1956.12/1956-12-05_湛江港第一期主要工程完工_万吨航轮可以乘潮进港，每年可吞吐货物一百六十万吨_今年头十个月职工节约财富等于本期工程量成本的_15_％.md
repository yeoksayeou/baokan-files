Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 4th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Weiqun reports): Zhanjiang Port, China's first self-designed modern commercial port, has completed its first phase of major construction and has been inspected and approved by the Ministry of Communications, which deemed the project quality up to standard. After the completion of the first phase of construction, the annual cargo throughput can reach 1.6 million tons, and with appropriate expansion in the future, the maximum throughput can reach 4.6 million tons.

Currently, a deep-water wharf capable of berthing two 10,000-ton ships has been completed. The construction of channels, navigation marks, and port basins has also been basically completed, and ocean-going 10,000-ton ships can enter the port on high tide. Adjacent to the wharf, a large storage yard has been built. The seven railway tracks laid between the wharf and the storage yard connect Zhanjiang Port to the Li-Zhan Railway, allowing hundreds of train cars loaded with goods to enter and exit within a day. On the wharf, eight gantry cranes stand tall, and when they all rotate together, they can load and unload forty tons of cargo every ninety seconds. Various mobile loading and unloading machinery, power transmission, distribution, communication, and other equipment have also been installed in the port area accordingly. The first phase of construction also includes an oil wharf, an intermediate wharf, and corresponding equipment, which are currently under construction and are expected to be completed by June next year.

Zhanjiang Port is a natural ice-free seaport, and the scale of its first phase of construction is larger than that of Tianjin's new port, with superior natural conditions and equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 4th: The workers constructing Zhanjiang Port saved the state more than 1.82 million yuan in the first ten months of this year, equivalent to 15% of the project cost during this period.

　　湛江港第一期主要工程完工
　　万吨航轮可以乘潮进港，每年可吞吐货物一百六十万吨
　　今年头十个月职工节约财富等于本期工程量成本的15％
    据新华社广州4日电　新华社记者杨伟群报道：中国自己设计的第一个现代化商港——湛江港，已经完成第一期主要工程，并经交通部验收，认为工程质量合乎规格。第一期建设工程完成以后，每年可以吞吐货物一百六十万吨，以后如果适当扩建，最大吞吐量可以达到四百六十万吨。
    现在，港口里一座可以靠泊两艘万吨级轮船的深水码头已经完工。航道、航标和港池的工程也基本完成，远洋万吨轮船可以乘潮进港。码头邻近，建成了广阔的堆货场。铺设在码头和堆货场之间的七条铁路股道网把湛江港同黎湛铁路联结起来，它们能够在一天内让火车的上百辆车皮满载货物进出通过。码头上，耸立着八架龙门式起重机，它们一齐转动起来，每九十秒钟就能装卸四十吨货物。港区里还相应地装置了各种流动的装卸机械、输电、配电、通讯等设备。建港第一期工程，还包括有油码头、中级码头，以及相应的设备，这些也正进行建筑中，预计到明年6月可以完成。
    湛江港是天然的不冻海港，它的第一期建设工程的规模比塘沽新港还要大，自然条件和设备也比塘沽新港优越。
    据新华社广州4日电　建设湛江港的职工，在今年头十个月中，为国家节约了一百八十二万多元财富，等于这个时期工程量成本的15％。
