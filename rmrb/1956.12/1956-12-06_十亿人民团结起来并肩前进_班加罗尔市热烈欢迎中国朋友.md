Xinhua News Agency, Bangalore, December 4th: The plane carrying Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage landed in Bangalore airport today amidst a drizzle. However, the enthusiasm of this southern Indian city in welcoming the guests was not dampened in the slightest.

Greeting the Chinese guests at the airport were the Governor and Chief Minister of Mysore State, as well as people from all walks of life. The welcoming crowd presented the Chinese guests with garlands and bouquets. The orchestras played the national anthems of China and India. Premier Zhou Enlai reviewed the guard of honor. Afterwards, they traveled by car to visit the nearby Hindustan Aircraft Factory.

When the Chinese guests left the factory and traveled through the main streets of the city, the crowds lining the streets applauded and cheered, chanting slogans such as "Indian and Chinese people are brothers."

Xinhua News Agency, Bangalore, December 5th: On the afternoon of the 4th, more than 30,000 Bangalore citizens gathered at the College Hockey Ground to warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long.

Speaking at the meeting, Zhou Enlai said: "The purpose of our visit to India is to further promote the friendship between the peoples of India and China, to learn from the Indian people, and to strengthen the cooperation between our two peoples."

Zhou Enlai said that China and India should also strengthen cooperation in international affairs. He said: "Today, when colonialists are still carrying out aggression, it is especially necessary to strengthen our cooperation so that the glory of Panchsheel can shine in every corner of the world."

Mayor Krishnappa presented garlands to Zhou Enlai and He Long, and the Governor and Chief Minister of Mysore State presented the Chinese guests with a Mysore sandalwood box.

In his welcoming speech to Premier Zhou Enlai, the Mayor said: "The foreign policy of the People's Republic of China, as you have explained, clearly demonstrates your love for freedom and peace." After mentioning the many developments China has made in agriculture, industry, and culture in recent years, he wished China continued success in achieving many new advances.

Zhou Enlai and He Long then walked to the edge of the platform to greet the audience in the Indian manner. At this time, people cheered enthusiastically, shouting "Zhou Enlai Ki Jai" (Victory to Zhou Enlai) and "Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai."

Earlier that afternoon, Zhou Enlai and his party, accompanied by the Governor of Mysore State, also visited the Indian National Science Institute.

Xinhua News Agency, Bangalore, December 5th: The Governor of Mysore State, Jaya Chamaraja Wadiyar Bahadur, and Premier Zhou Enlai both pledged on the evening of December 4th to strengthen the friendly relations between India and China and exchanged gifts.

They spoke and exchanged gifts at a grand banquet held at the Mysore State Governor's residence in Bangalore.

Bahadur, the former Maharaja of Mysore, is the only Indian Maharaja currently holding a senior government position. He said that after generations of vicissitudes, the friendship between China and India remains brilliant. He pointed out: "Today, both countries are striving for the economic and cultural progress of their people in their own ways. Their belief in peaceful coexistence has indeed increased year by year." Premier Zhou Enlai said in his reply: "The close unity of 400 million Indian people and 600 million Chinese people, advancing shoulder to shoulder, is not only a fortunate thing for the people of these two countries, but also a very important factor in defending peace in Asia, Africa, and the world."

    据新华社班加罗尔4日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和他们的随行人员所搭乘的飞机今天在蒙蒙的细雨中在班加罗尔机场着陆，但是这个印度南部的城市接待客人们的热情一点也没有受到影响。
    在机场欢迎中国客人们的有迈索尔邦的邦长和首席部长以及各界人士。欢迎的人给中国客人们戴上花环，并向他们献花。乐队奏了中印两国的国歌。周恩来总理检阅了仪仗队。随后，他们乘车前往附近的印度斯坦飞机工厂参观。
    中国客人们在离开工厂后乘车通过市内的主要街道的时候，夹道欢迎的人鼓掌欢呼，并且高呼“印中人民是兄弟”的口号。
    据新华社班加罗尔5日电　4日下午，三万多班加罗尔市民集合在学院曲棍球场，热烈欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理。
    周恩来在大会上讲话的时候说：“我们这次访问印度的目的在于进一步促进印度和中国两国人民之间的友谊，向印度人民学习，并且加强我们两国人民之间的合作。”
    周恩来说，中国和印度也应该在国际事务上加强合作。他说：“今天，当殖民主义者仍然在进行侵略的时候，尤其有必要加强我们的合作，使潘查希拉的光辉能够照耀世界的每一个角落。”
    市长克里希纳帕向周恩来和贺龙献了花环，迈索尔邦邦长和首席部长送给中国贵宾们一只迈索尔檀香盒。
    市长在致词欢迎周恩来总理的时候说：“你所说明的中华人民共和国的外交政策清楚地说明了你们对自由和和平的热爱”。他在谈到最近几年来，中国在农业、工业和文化方面的许多发展以后祝中国继续取得许多新的进步。
    周恩来和贺龙随后走到高台的边上，以印度的方式向听众们致意。这时人们热烈地欢呼，高呼“周恩来基贾”（祝周恩来胜利）和“印地秦尼巴依巴依”。
    在这以前，周恩来一行在这天下午还在迈索尔邦邦长的陪同下参观了印度国家科学研究所。
    据新华社班加罗尔5日电　印度迈索尔邦邦长贾雅·查马拉贾·瓦德雅尔·巴哈杜尔同周恩来总理在12月4日晚上都保证要加强印度和中国的友好关系，并且互相赠送了礼物。
    他们是在班加罗尔的迈索尔邦长官邸举行的盛大的宴会上讲话和互赠礼物的。
    巴哈杜尔是前迈索尔土邦的大君，他是现在担任政府要职的唯一的印度土邦大君。他说，经历了世世代代的沧桑之后，中国和印度的友谊依然光辉灿烂。他指出：“今天，两国都在按照它们自己的方式为它们的人民的经济和文化进步而奋斗。它们对和平共处的信念的确一年比一年增加了。”周恩来总理在致答词的时候说：“四亿印度人民和六亿中国人民亲密地团结起来，并肩前进，这不仅是这两国人民感到幸运的事，而且也是在保卫亚非两洲和世界和平方面的十分重要的因素。”
