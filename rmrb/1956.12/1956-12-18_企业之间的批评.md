Criticizing Others While Only Caring About Oneself

The Jinan City Textile Products Company, in pursuit of excessively high commercial profits, shows no consideration for industrial production. This year, the company commissioned the Jinan Local State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory to produce cloth. Due to unreasonable processing fees, the factory lost more than 11,300 yuan, while the Textile Products Company profited more than 69,100 yuan. As a result, the Jinan Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory generally lacks enthusiasm and confidence in trial-producing new products.

The printing and dyeing factories in Jinan are all processing units and are supplied with gray cloth (i.e., undyed cloth) by the Textile Products Company. The Textile Products Company often mixes in some substandard products. These substandard products are caused by the weaving factory, and the company has already deducted money from the weaving factory. However, after this cloth is dyed by the dyeing factory and results in substandard products, which is not the responsibility of the printing and dyeing factory, the company unreasonably demands to deduct money from the dyeing factory in order to obtain more profits. This number of substandard products is very large, often accounting for 50% of the total substandard products of the printing and dyeing factory, and sometimes even reaching 70%. This not only affects the printing and dyeing factory's completion of profit and cost plans but also seriously restricts the completion of the printing and dyeing factory's quality plan.

The quota for yarn set by the Textile Products Company is also unreasonable. For example, the Jinan Cotton Textile Factory produced more than 734,000 meters of wrapped cloth from May to September this year. Due to the company giving less yarn, it lost 8,879 pieces of yarn.

In order to pursue profits, the Textile Products Company has also come up with many ways to make things difficult for the factory. For example, the vulcanized blue cloth dyed by the Chengtong Yarn Factory in July this year was originally a sample inspected and approved by Technician Feng of the Textile Products Company. However, later, cadres from the company's processing section believed that the color was not deep enough and forced the factory to rework it, causing the factory undue losses.

It is hoped that relevant departments will investigate and deal with the Jinan City Textile Products Company's practice of only caring about making money for itself and not caring about others' losses.　Zhang Yimin

Do Not Arbitrarily Destroy Large Oil Tanks

The Qingdao Light Industry Bureau's vegetable oil factory has a large oil tank with a capacity of 1,200 tons. As long as it is installed, it can solve the problem of oil storage equipment for several oil factories. There is no such oil tank in other oil factories in Shandong. Take the Jinan Vegetable Oil Factory as an example. It is a relatively large oil factory in Shandong, but it does not have oil storage equipment and only relies on a portion of oil drums supplied by the processing department, which is very untimely. The oil produced by this factory is mainly for export. Therefore, it is even more urgent to solve the problem of oil storage equipment. The higher-level authorities also feel that this is a problem. However, building a new oil tank requires a large investment. This problem could be solved by transferring the oil tank from the Qingdao Vegetable Oil Factory. However, it is said that in order to complete its basic construction tasks, the Qingdao Light Industry Bureau is preparing to destroy the oil tank and use it to modify other equipment. Completing basic construction tasks is important, but a good oil tank should not be destroyed for no reason. Moreover, modifying a good oil tank into other equipment is both labor-intensive and material-intensive, and all the accessories of the oil tank are scrapped and cannot be used. It is hoped that the Qingdao Light Industry Bureau will immediately stop this plan and transfer the oil tank to a factory that urgently needs it.　Zhou Kejun

Should Be Responsible for Their Own Products

Anhui Province suffered from floods this year, and the water wheels produced in the province were not enough to supply demand. In August, the Provincial Water Conservancy Department sent people to the Northeast to purchase them. In September, when the water wheels were transported to Bengbu, it was discovered that almost none of the 1,500 water wheels sent by the Changchun Handicraft Industry Cooperative were completely packaged. More than 90% of the straw bags containing the parts were rotten, and many parts, such as screws, nuts, wrenches, and oil pots, were scattered all over the platform. Some water wheels were broken and could not be moved off the train cars. We immediately telegraphed the Shenyang Farm Implement and Agricultural Machinery Wholesale Station and the Changchun Handicraft Industry Cooperative to send people to inspect and hand over the goods. After several requests, it was not until November 21 that a comrade surnamed Song was sent by the Changchun No. 1 Ironware Cooperative. This Comrade Song admitted that what we said was true, but he also said that their factory did not have direct contact with us, and the leadership only asked him to come and understand the situation and could not provide any answers. And then he hurried away.

We believe that it is wrong for the Jilin Provincial Handicraft Industry Cooperative to send such a cadre to Bengbu in such a perfunctory and careless manner. The Jilin Provincial Handicraft Industry Cooperative and the factory producing the water wheels should be responsible for their own products and packaging and should not ignore them after they leave the factory.

### 企业之间的批评

    企业之间的批评
    只顾自己不顾别人
    济南市纺织品公司为了追求过高的商业利润，毫不照顾工业生产。今年这个公司委托济南地方国营棉纺织厂生产的布，由于工缴费不合理，工厂亏损了一万一千三百余元；而纺织品公司却盈余了六万九千一百余元。因此，济南市纺织印染厂普遍对试制新产品积极性不高，信心不足。
    济南市的印染厂都是加工单位，由纺织品公司供应坯布（即白布）。纺织品公司常常夹带进一部分次品。这些次品是织布厂造成的，这个公司已扣罚了织布厂的款。这些布到染厂加染后造成的次品，本来不是印染厂的责任，但是，这个公司为了取得更多的利润，又无理地要罚染厂的款。这种次品数量很大，常常占印染厂总次品的50％，有时甚至达70％。这样，不仅影响印染厂完成利润、成本计划，而且严重地限制了印染厂质量计划的完成。
    纺织品公司规定的给纱定额也不合理。如济南棉纺织厂今年5月至9月份生产包皮布七十三万四千多公尺，由于该公司给的纱少，亏纱八千八百七十九件。
    纺织品公司为了追求利润，还想出了很多办法刁难工厂。例如成通纱厂今年7月份加染的硫化青布，本来是纺织品公司冯技师到厂检验同意的样品，但后来该公司加工科干部认为色泽不深，硬逼着厂方返工，使工厂造成不应有的损失。
    济南市纺织品公司这种只顾自己赚钱不顾别人亏本的作法，希望有关单位检查处理。　张一民
    不要任意毁坏大油罐
    青岛轻工业局所属植物油厂有一个容量一千二百吨的大油罐，只要安装起来就能解决几个油厂的储油设备问题。像这样的油罐在山东其它油厂是没有的。就以济南植物油厂来说，在山东是个较大型的油厂，但没有储油设备，仅仅依靠加工部门供应的部分油桶，而且很不及时。这个厂所生产的油主要是供出口的。这样就更迫切需要解决储油设备问题。上级主管部门也感觉这是个问题，但是，新修一个油罐需要很大一笔投资。如果调用青岛植物油厂的油罐就可以解决这一问题。但是，据说青岛轻工业局为了完成基本建设任务，准备毁坏这个油罐，用来改制其它设备。完成基本建设任务是重要的，不过，不应该把一个好油罐无故地毁掉。而且将一个好油罐改制其它设备，既费工又费料，油罐的全部附件报废，不能利用。希望青岛轻工业局立即停止这个打算，把油罐转让给迫切需要的工厂。　周克珺
    应该对自己的产品负责
    安徽省今年受水灾，本省所产水车不够供应，8月间，省水利厅派人去东北采购。9月间水车运到蚌埠，发现由长春手工业联社发来的一千五百台水车，几乎没有完整的包装，装零件的草包腐烂90％以上，许多零件，如螺丝、螺丝母、扳手、油壶等撒满站台，有的水车已折断，无法搬下车厢，我们当即电告沈阳农具农械批发站和长春手工业联社速派人来验交。经过几次催请，直到11月21日，长春第一铁业社才派来一位姓宋的同志。这位宋同志承认我们所说的都是事实，但他又说他们厂与我们不直接发生关系，领导上只叫他来了解一下情况，不能提出任何答复。就这样匆匆忙忙地扬长而去。
    我们认为吉林省手工业联社派这样一个干部来蚌埠，马马虎虎，敷衍了事，是不对的。吉林省手工业联社和生产水车的厂方应对自己的产品和包装负责，不能推出门不管。
