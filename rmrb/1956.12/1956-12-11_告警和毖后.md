Title: Warning and Prevention

Having read Comrade Chang Gong's "Can One Not Give a Warning if One Cannot Cure a Sore?" (People's Daily, page 8, November 30), I raise both hands in approval. I think it is correct to understand criticism in this way, especially criticism written in the form of essays. Because essays are generally short, we can ask the author to consider the problem comprehensively, but we cannot ask the author to write about everything in the article. According to our past tradition, essays often only raise questions, but do not have to offer solutions at the same time like "buy one get one free." Its role is only what Comrade Chang Gong said: to give a warning.

The significance of this warning should not be underestimated.

Starting from this significance, I would also like to add two points: First, the appearance of a criticism lies not only in showing it to the criticized, but more importantly, to everyone, so that the criticism has universal significance; Second, the role of a criticism lies not only in making immediate corrections if possible, but more importantly, in serving as a reference for future work, so that the criticism has a far-reaching effect. As for what should be changed immediately and what should be revised in future work, it depends on the criticized person weighing the importance of the problem and making appropriate arrangements. If one believes that only criticism that has immediate practical effects counts as criticism, then one is not only narrowing the meaning of criticism, but is actually distorting criticism, or even canceling criticism altogether.

Unfortunately, there are still such facts in real life. If you don't believe me, you can read Comrade Su Liequn's "Thoughts on 'Reading to Death'" published in the Shanghai "Liberation Daily" on December 2. The following is the most brilliant passage:

"… Even when commemorating Lu Xun, some people's ideas violate Lu Xun's will. They always want to fight for more space for Lu Xun's tomb, as if it is not enough to commemorate Lu Xun otherwise. I think that when people remember Lu Xun, holding memorial meetings, moving his tomb, and setting up memorial halls, these actions stem from heartfelt respect. For Lu Xun's request of 'do not do anything about commemoration,' it should be like receiving money from 'old friends,' 'not within this exception'; but if one thinks that it is necessary to squeeze out the Hongkou Stadium to commemorate him, then it violates Lu Xun's will. Lu Xun never sought his own comfort at the expense of others' happiness (for example, he did not like others playing football when he was chatting intimately with friends), and demolishing the stadium, which cost a considerable amount of money to build a few years ago, damages the interests of the masses who love sports. If Lu Xun were alive, he would not agree…" If people have read my "Unnecessary 'Social Status Matching'" (People's Daily, page 8, November 13), they will know that this is specifically aimed at my article; if people do not look at my writing with Comrade Su Liequn's eyes, they will also know that what I raised is an arrangement issue, while explaining who should be responsible for this issue. I have seen and supported the rapid progress of sports in our country in recent years, and I think this is a major event in people's lives. Therefore, I repeatedly stated in the short article that I am not advocating "abandoning military affairs in favor of cultural pursuits." Comrade Su Liequn, without considering other people's opinions, deliberately twists the pen and describes me as an old "second landlord" on the Shanghai Bund, staging a "forced eviction" drama, not only forcing, but also "squeezing" and "demolishing," painting a picture of me as a local bully. I respect Mr. Lu Xun very much, and I am also aware that I am not worthy to know even one ten-thousandth of Mr. Lu Xun, but I really did not expect that Mr. Lu Xun also needs "territory" like a warlord, and that I also have the responsibility to fight for "territory" for him. I admire Comrade Su Liequn's courage to say such things!

"Not letting others be happy while seeking one's own comfort" is indeed a shameful thing, whether it is for those who are "chatting intimately" or for those who are "playing football." This is why I advocate that there should be appropriate arrangements. I don't know what position Comrade Su Liequn was standing on when he said this? I did not advocate "demolishing" or "squeezing" because I know for sure that this is the property of the state and the blood and sweat of the people. Fortunately, the stadium can be "demolished" and "squeezed," which gives Comrade Su Liequn the convenience of arbitrarily accusing people. If it were another occasion, for example, some time ago, due to improper breeding, a large number of chickens and ducks died in Shanghai. If I criticized this incident, could it be said that I was barbarously advocating that all the dead chickens and ducks be brought back to life?

Let me say it again: The greatest purpose of criticism is to give a warning and to prevent future occurrences. Of course, what can be changed at present should also be changed according to the conditions. For example, in front of the cultural club, one can play tennis, basketball, and football (what I referred to in my previous article was not "playing football," which can be reviewed again), becoming a veritable training ground, instead of holding sports meetings and playing loudspeakers there. This is an appropriate disposal. Why must you distort other people's meaning and plant in "squeezing" or "demolishing," may I ask?

Our atmosphere of criticism is too thin; I support Comrade Su Liequn's words: Don't "not listen to other people's criticism, not tolerate other people's dissent."

### 告警和毖后

专栏：

    告警和毖后
    唐弢
    读了长工同志“不会治疮就不能告警吗？”（11月30日人民日报八版）一文，我举起双手赞成。我认为这样来理解批评，特别是用杂文形式所写的批评，是正确的。因为杂文一般都比较短小，我们可以要求作者对所提问题作全面的考虑，却不可能要求作者在文章里写得面面俱到。根据我们过去的传统，杂文往往只是提出问题，却不必像“买一送一”一样，同时奉赠解决问题的办法，它的作用只在于长工同志所说的：告警。
    不能看轻的是这告警的意义。
    从这一意义出发，我还想补充两点：第一，一篇批评的出现，固在于给被批评者看，更重要的是给大家看，这才使批评有普遍的意义；第二，一篇批评的作用，固在于使可以改正的立刻改正，更重要的是给今后工作做参考，这才使批评有深远的作用。至于什么应该立即改变，什么应该留待以后工作中修正，那就要靠被批评者权衡问题的轻重，作适当的处理。如果认为只有立刻发生实际效果的批评才算批评，那就不仅缩小了批评的意义，实际上也是在歪曲批评，或者根本取消批评。
    不幸在现实生活里竟还有这样的事实，谓予不信，可以12月2日上海“解放日报”发表的苏列群同志“读‘死’有感”为证，下面是最精彩的一段：
    “……就是对纪念鲁迅，有人的想法也违背了鲁迅的意志，总想为鲁迅的坟墓多争一点地盘，好像不这样就不足以纪念鲁迅似的。我以为，人们忆念鲁迅，开纪念会、迁墓、设纪念馆，这些出于由衷的崇敬，对于鲁迅要求的‘不要做任何关于纪念的事情’，是应该像收受‘老朋友的’钱一样，‘不在此例’的；但如果以为必须把虹口体育场挤掉，才算纪念，就同鲁迅的遗嘱相违背了。——鲁迅是从来没有不让别人快乐而图自己安逸的（例如不乐意别人在自己同朋友把臂促膝谈心时踢足球之类），把花了一笔不小的钱在几年前早就建立起来的体育场拆掉，损害广大爱好体育的群众的利益，如果鲁迅在天有灵，想来决不会同意……”如果人们读过我的“不必要的‘门当户对’”（11月13日人民日报八版），就会知道，这是专对我的文章而发的；如果人们不用苏列群同志那样的眼睛来看我的文字，也一定会知道，我所提出的是一个安排问题，同时说明谁应该对这个问题负责。近年来我国体育运动的突飞猛进，我是看到的，拥护的，我认为这是人民生活中的一件大事情，所以在短文里一再声明，我不是主张“偃武修文”。苏列群同志毫不考虑别人的意见，故意扭转笔头，将我形容成为过去上海滩上的“二房东”，在那里闹“赶搬家”的把戏，不仅赶，而且还要“挤”，还要“拆”，给我画上一个恶霸的脸谱。我很尊敬鲁迅先生，也自知不足以知鲁迅先生于万一，但我的确没有想到：鲁迅先生也像军阀一样需要“地盘”，而自己又还有责任替他去争“地盘”，我佩服苏列群同志有说出这样话来的勇气！
    “不让别人快乐而图自己安逸”，的确是一件可耻的事情，对“把臂促膝谈心”者如此，对“踢足球”者也如此，这就是我主张应该有适当安排的原因。我不知道苏列群同志说这句话的时候，自己是站在什么立场上？我没有主张“拆”，也没有主张“挤”，因为我确切知道，这是国家的财产，人民的血汗。幸亏运动场可“拆”可“挤”，给了苏列群同志任意加罪于人的方便。倘使换了别一场合，譬如前一时候，由于饲养不当，上海死了一大批鸡鸭，如果我批评了这件事，难道也能够说我是横蛮地在主张把死了的鸡鸭一齐都弄活过来吗？
    让我再说一遍：批评的最大目的在于告警，在于毖后。目前能够改变的，当然也应该看条件求其改变。譬如文化俱乐部前面，就可以拍网球，打篮球，踢足球（我前文指的并不是“踢足球”，可以复按），成为一个名副其实的锻炼场，而不必在那里开运动会，放大喇叭。这就是一个适当的处置。为什么一定要歪曲别人的意思，栽进“挤”或“拆”去呢，敢问？
    我们的批评空气太稀薄了；我拥护苏列群同志这句话：不要“听不得别人的批评，见不得别人的异议。”
