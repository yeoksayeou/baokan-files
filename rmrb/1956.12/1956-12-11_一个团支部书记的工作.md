    The Work of a Youth League Branch Secretary
    Feng Fan
    He sticks to his desk all day,
    Work assaults him from all sides!
    "Secretary Wang, this is the work summary of the Third Branch."
    He glances at it, flicks his pen,
    And writes "Submitted."
    "Secretary Wang, this is the work instruction from the Youth League Committee."
    He glances at it, flicks his pen,
    And writes "Dispatched."
    The telephone rings incessantly—
    "Oh, is that the Youth League Committee, what...
    The summary of the Third Branch is not comprehensive enough?"
    He barely puts down the receiver before picking it up again—
    "Secretary Wang, the instructions from the Youth League Committee are not suitable for the specific situation of our Seventh Branch."
    He skillfully presses the switch,
    And picks it up to call:
    "Hello, Third Branch?
    Your summary needs to be supplemented."
    Presses it again, picks it up again—
    "Hello, Youth League Committee?
    The instructions are not suitable for the Seventh Branch,
    Can you supplement them?"
    One mouth with two layers of skin,
    Plus a telephone,
    Not touched by the wind or dampened by the rain,
    The work proceeds as smoothly as an assembly line.

    一个团支部书记的工作
    冯凡
    他整天粘在办公桌上，
    工作从四面八方向他袭来！
    “王书记，这是三支部的工作总结。”
    他眼睛一扫，笔杆一摇，
    批了个“上交”。
    “王书记，这是团委的工作指示。”
    他眼睛一扫，笔杆一摇，
    批了个“下达”。
    电话铃响成一片——
    “噢，团委吗，什么……
    三支部的总结不全面？”
    听筒刚放下，又拿起——
    “王书记，团委指示对我们七支部的具体情况不适宜。”
    他熟练地压一下机子，
    又抓起来叫话：
    “喂，三支部吗？
    你们的总结要补充一下。”
    再压一下，再拿起——
    “喂，团委吗？
    指示对七支部不适宜，
    你们给补充补充吧！”
    一张嘴两层皮，
    外加一架电话机，
    风刮不着，雨淋不着，
    工作进行得像流水作业般顺利。
