Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: New York Dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly concluded on December 21st its discussion of the French, British, and Israeli "accusations" that the Egyptian government had "violated human rights and international law" in its treatment of British, French, and Jewish residents.

    Representatives from many countries pointed out in their speeches that the accusations made by England and France were baseless.

    Syrian representative Zeineddine emphasized that the aggressors were already isolated, so they stubbornly tried to divert people's attention from their disgraceful actions.

    Jordanian representative Rifai said that this was a trick adopted by the representatives of the aggressor countries in order to achieve certain political goals. The new discussion will only further expose the crimes committed by the aggressors against the Egyptian people.

    Saudi Arabian representative Dejani said that his delegation believed that the measures taken by Egypt in handling foreigners on its territory were completely correct and necessary. The exaggerated so-called expulsion issue is part of a propaganda campaign carefully launched by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Kuznetsov, emphasized that England, France, and Israel had invaded Egypt. They turned Port Said into ruins, severely damaged other cities and many rural areas, and killed and persecuted peaceful Egyptian residents. These aggressor countries, which trampled on the basic norms of relations between independent countries and grossly violated human rights and international law norms, are now attempting to accuse the young nation of Egypt of violating human rights.

    If we were to recognize the legitimacy of this extremely strange accusation by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, even for a minute, we would be agreeing to let the law of the world give way to violence. At the same time, we would be setting a dangerous precedent, allowing any future aggressor to disguise themselves as defenders of the rule of law and humanity, and portray the crimes committed by the aggressor themselves as their own sacrifices.

    Kuznetsov said that any independent and sovereign country, especially when it is subjected to aggression, has the full right to take necessary measures to ensure internal security. These measures are within the scope of the functions of an independent country and cannot be the subject of discussion by the United Nations General Assembly. This is especially true in the current situation, because British, French, and Jewish people have not been subjected to violence.

    Kuznetsov concluded by saying that the United Nations General Assembly should firmly reject this unfounded accusation by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, because this accusation is merely a new attempt to interfere in Egypt's internal affairs. All invading forces must be required to withdraw from Egypt as soon as possible and stop their brutal atrocities against peaceful residents. The United Nations should take measures to make the aggressors compensate for the losses suffered by Egypt. The initiators of the aggression must not be allowed to become the plaintiffs, while the victims of the aggression are turned into the defendants.

    Representatives from Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia also condemned the attempt by the United Kingdom, France, and Israel to use this accusation case to divert people's attention from their crimes of aggression against Egypt.

    American representative Wadsworth, in his speech, acknowledged that the Egyptian government had the right to take measures aimed at safeguarding its own security, but he immediately said that the American government expressed "unease" about Egypt's "maltreatment" of certain citizens. Seeing that the course of the discussion was unfavorable to the United Kingdom, France, and Israel, who had filed the accusation, Wadsworth requested that the discussion be ended.

    The General Assembly finally adjourned the discussion on this issue without adopting any resolutions or making any decisions.

### 英法以在联大反诬埃及，结果自取其辱  苏联等国代表揭露侵略者企图转移罪责

    英法以在联大反诬埃及，结果自取其辱
    苏联等国代表揭露侵略者企图转移罪责
    新华社22日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会12月21日结束了关于法国、英国和以色列“控诉”埃及政府在对待英法侨民和犹太人方面“违背了人权和国际法”的问题的讨论。
    许多国家的代表在发言中都指出了英法的控诉是毫无根据的。
    叙利亚代表宰尼丁强调指出，侵略者已经处于孤立地位，所以他们顽固地企图转移人们对他们的不体面的行动的注意。
    约旦代表里法伊说，这是侵略国代表为了达到一定政治目的所采取的手腕。新的讨论只会进一步揭露侵略者对埃及人民干下的罪行。
    沙特阿拉伯代表德贾尼说，他的代表团相信，埃及在处理自己领土上的外国人方面所采取的措施是完全正确而必要的。关于言过其实的所谓驱逐问题，是英、法、以三国处心积虑展开的宣传运动的一部分。
    苏联代表团团长库兹?佐夫着重指出，英法和以色列侵略了埃及。它们把塞得港变为废墟、严重地破坏了别的一些城市和许多农村、杀害和迫害埃及的和平居民，而这些践踏独立国家之间关系的起码准则、粗暴地侵害人权和国际法准则的侵略国家现在竟企图控诉年青的国家埃及侵犯人权。
    对英、法、以三国这个极奇怪的控诉，如果我们那怕只有一分钟承认它的合法性，我们就等于同意把世界上的法律让位给暴力，同时，这样我们更开了一个危险的先例，使将来任何侵略者都可以把自己装扮成法制和人道的保卫者，把侵略者自己犯下的罪恶说成是自己的牺牲。
    库兹?佐夫说，任何一个独立自主的国家，尤其当它遭到侵略的时候，都有充分权利采取必要手段来保证内部的安全。这些手段是一个独立国家的职权范围之内的，不能作为联合国大会讨论的对象。在目前情况下尤其不能作为讨论对象，因为在英、法和犹太人方面并没有受到暴力。
    库兹?佐夫最后说，联合国大会应该坚决否决英、法、以三国这种无根据的控诉，因为这种控诉只是干涉埃及内政的新企图。必须要求一切侵略军队赶快撤出埃及并且停止对和平居民进行残酷的暴行。联合国应当采取措施来使侵略者赔偿埃及遭到的损失。不要使发起侵略的人成为原告，而受侵略的牺牲者反而变成被告。
    保加利亚和捷克斯洛伐克代表也谴责英、法、以三国企图利用这个控诉案来转移人们对它们侵略埃及的罪行的注意。
    美国代表华兹沃斯发言时承认，埃及政府有权采取目的在于保障本身安全的措施，但是他马上又说，美国政府对埃及“虐待”某些公民表示“不安”。由于看到讨论的过程对提出控诉案的英、法、以三国不利，华兹沃斯要求结束这个讨论。
    大会最后在没有通过任何决议或者作出任何决定的情况下宣告结束关于这个问题的讨论。
