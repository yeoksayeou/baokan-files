Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd: The Guangzhou Municipal Tax Bureau and its district bureaus have practiced thrift and careful budgeting this year, saving a total of more than 38,000 yuan in administrative expenses. This figure is equivalent to 17% of the original budget expenditure.

This bureau comprehensively formulated specific savings plans in all aspects, such as office supplies and furniture purchases, in July of this year, and designated relevant staff to be responsible for inspection and supervision. The bureau also came up with various methods to save money. For example, in terms of office supplies, they used second-brand goods instead of famous-brand goods. For example, they used local paper at 24 yuan per ream instead of white paper at 30.02 yuan per ream. Because staff members had to go out on duty frequently, the cost of repairing bicycles was a significant monthly expense, so some district bureaus mobilized odd-job workers to learn to repair them themselves. One district bureau saved 400 yuan by buying materials and building a bicycle shed themselves. From April, the light bulbs in the bureau and its affiliated units were universally reduced in wattage. Reasonable adjustments were also made to the dormitories of staff and their families. As a result, in addition to handing over and returning two buildings, they also freed up housing to solve the housing problems of 191 people.

    今年一贯精打细算  节约大笔行政经费
    新华社广州22日电　广州市税务局和所属各区分局今年精打细算，共节约了行政经费三万八千多元，这个数字相当于原预算开支的17％。
    今年7月，这个局就全面制定了办公用具、家具购置等各方面的具体节约计划，并且指定有关工作人员负责检查督促。这个局还想出各种办法来进行节约，如在办公用具方面，他们采用副牌货代替名牌货。比方每令三十元零二角的白报纸，他们就使用每令二十四元的土报纸代替。因为工作人员出勤多，修理自行车的费用每月开支不少，于是有的区分局就发动勤杂人员自己学习修理。有一个区分局买材料自己施工修理一个放自行车的车房，节约了四百元。从4月份起，这个局及所属各单位内的电灯都普遍降低了烛光。工作人员及家属的宿舍也进行了合理调整，结果除了上缴和退租了两幢房子以外，还腾出房子解决了一百九十一人的住宅问题。
