Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 5th: Yuan Hanqing, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made suggestions on strengthening the connections and cooperation between various universities and some research units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences during his inspection of scientific research work in Jiangsu universities. Yuan Hanqing believes that the researchers of some related units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing have achieved many accomplishments in their scientific research work in connection and cooperation with professors in some universities in Nanjing, but it is not frequent and close enough, and this connection and cooperation should be continuously strengthened in the future. Professors in Nanjing universities hope to get assistance from some units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in their research work, and they should also try their best to solve it. He suggested that in the future, some experts and researchers from relevant units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Nanjing can also take on some teaching work in Nanjing universities, so that they can often contact and understand each other, help each other, and promote the development of scientific research work. In view of the current teaching situation of professors in various universities, Yuan Hanqing proposed that professors in various universities should also take on concurrent courses according to actual needs. Professors who specialize in a certain discipline can specialize in teaching courses in this discipline in several universities. This can not only save manpower, but also help improve the quality of teaching, and also help further develop scientific research work.

Based on the information he learned during the inspection, Yuan Hanqing believes that many teaching assistants have been giving lectures in various universities in recent years. This is a very large teaching force. At the same time, it is also a very important force for teaching assistants to carry out scientific research work in universities. He proposed that while teaching assistants are engaged in teaching work, they should also have a certain amount of time to carry out scientific research work, so that the country can cultivate more new forces in scientific research work. He also suggested that ideological persuasion should also be carried out for some teaching assistants who are unwilling to take on teaching work and demand to specialize in scientific research work.

During the inspection, Yuan Hanqing also learned that various universities need the relevant departments of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to provide certain financial and human support and assistance to universities in scientific research work; there is a need to establish a science and technology library in Nanjing and that the Jiangsu People's Publishing House can appropriately publish some scientific papers and academic books; and there is a need for the Chinese Academy of Sciences to regularly edit a joint catalog of scientific and technological journal papers from China and other countries. Yuan Hanqing has already reflected some of these opinions and requests to the relevant units in Jiangsu Province, and some will be reported and submitted to the relevant central units.

After inspecting various universities in Nanjing and Nantong, Jiangsu, Yuan Hanqing also believes that the quiet environment of various universities and the many newly added instruments, equipment, and buildings in recent years are good conditions for carrying out scientific research work. He believes that the scientific research work of various universities in Jiangsu Province has already made great achievements. Many colleges and universities held scientific discussion meetings this year, and more than 600 scientific papers were reported. Most of these papers have practical guiding significance for the current national construction, industrial and agricultural production, medical and health undertakings, and teaching work.

From November 21 to December 4, Yuan Hanqing successively inspected the libraries and laboratories of universities such as Nanjing University and Nantong Medical College. During the inspection, he also held discussions with many professors and department heads to learn about many situations and existing problems in scientific research work in various universities.

    政协全国委员会委员袁翰青
　　在江苏视察后提出建议
　　科学院的一些研究工作人员应加强同教授的联系和合作，专家和研究工作人员可以兼任一些教学工作，教授可以在几个学校兼课，应给助教一些进行科学研究的时间。
    新华社南京5日电　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员袁翰青在江苏视察高等学校科学研究工作时，对加强各高等学校和中国科学院的一些研究单位的联系和合作问题，提出了建议。袁翰青认为，中国科学院在南京的一些有关单位的研究人员同南京的一些高等学校里的教授进行科学研究工作上的联系和合作已有许多成就，但是还不够经常和密切，今后应继续加强这种联系和合作。南京各高等学校的教授在研究工作上希望得到中国科学院的一些单位的协助，也应尽量求得解决。他建议今后中国科学院在南京的有关单位的一些专家、研究人员可以到南京的高等学校兼任一些教学工作，这样可以经常互相接触了解，互相帮助，促使科学研究工作的发展。袁翰青针对目前各高等学校教授的教学情况，提出各高等学校的教授也应根据实际需要互相兼课，专长某一专业学科的教授可以在几个高等学校专教这一学科的课程，这样既能节省人力，又有利于教学质量的提高，还可以帮助科学研究工作进一步开展。
    袁翰青根据视察时了解的情况，认为近年来各高等学校很多助教开课教学，这是一支很大的教学队伍，同时，助教在高等学校开展科学研究工作也是很重要的力量。他提出要使助教在进行教学工作的同时也有一定时间进行科学研究工作，以便国家在科学研究工作上培养更多的新生力量。他还建议，对于有些助教不愿担任教学工作，要求专门去做科学研究工作的思想，也要进行说服教育。
    袁翰青在视察期间，还了解到各高等学校需要中国科学院有关部门对高等学校进行科学研究工作给予一定的经费和人力上的支持和帮助的意见，需要在南京成立一个科学技术图书馆和江苏省人民出版社能适当出版一些科学论文以及学术性的书籍的意见，需要中国科学院定期编辑全国和各国科学技术期刊论文联合目录的意见等。这些意见和要求，袁翰青有的已反映给江苏省有关单位，有的将向中央有关单位汇报提出。
    袁翰青在江苏南京、南通视察了各高等学校以后，还认为各高等学校宁静的环境和近几年来新增加的许多仪器设备、建筑等，是进行科学研究工作很好的条件。他认为，江苏省各高等学校的科学研究工作已经有了很大的成绩，今年许多院校都举行了科学讨论会，报告的科学论文有六百多篇。这些论文大部分是对当前国家建设、工农业生产、医药卫生事业和教学工作等有着实际指导的意义。
    袁翰青从11月21日到12月4日，先后视察了南京大学、南通医学院等高等学校的图书馆和实验室。他在视察时期还和许多教授、系主任等举行了座谈会，了解到各高等学校里的科学研究工作的许多情况和存在的问题。
