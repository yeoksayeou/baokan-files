    Shanghai, December 9th, this newspaper reports: The CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee, at its recent Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting, decided to vigorously launch a production increase and thrift campaign in Shanghai, striving to increase production and fighting the difficulties of raw material shortages with a proactive spirit.
    The meeting pointed out that the primary task of Shanghai's production increase and thrift campaign must be placed on actively increasing production. Because Shanghai's industrial production potential is great, and next year, due to the increase in social purchasing power, market supply will be even tighter than this year, therefore, Shanghai's industrial departments must strive to increase production of all industrial products needed by society. The meeting pointed out that the key to increasing production is first of all to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials with a proactive spirit from various aspects, instead of simply reaching out to higher authorities. Nor should we retreat in the face of difficulties in raw material shortages. The meeting carefully studied and analyzed the sources of steel and other raw materials and believed that it was possible to strive for greater material sources. For example, the amount of waste steel that can be collected in Shanghai and its surrounding areas is still considerable. Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan and other places have local iron ore that can be exploited by indigenous methods, and if machinery is applied locally, the amount of mining can be increased. Shanghai's steel plants have decided to expand construction next year with investment from the central and local governments, which can increase some production. Overcoming the waste of raw materials in industrial production is also an important part. For example, the amount of steel used in sewing machines produced in Shanghai is almost twice as much as that used in sewing machines produced in some industrially advanced countries. The meeting called on the design personnel of industrial departments to improve their design level, correct the current phenomenon of excessive consumption of raw materials in product design, and rationally save raw materials.
    The meeting pointed out that Shanghai's light and heavy industrial departments should pay attention to the use of waste materials. The vast number of small and medium-sized factories in Shanghai have rich experience in using waste materials, and this good tradition should be carried forward. Industrial departments should also rationally promote the use of substitutes, such as using plastics to replace certain steel raw materials.
    The meeting decided to organize a large force to carry out the struggle to strive for raw material sources from various aspects. The meeting will recommend that the Shanghai Municipal Planning Commission add a deputy director to specifically lead this work.
    Another key to carrying out the production increase and thrift campaign is to truly launch the advanced producer movement, carry out technical transformation of enterprises, and overcome the formalism in the past advanced producer movement.
    The meeting also emphasized that increasing production must be carried out on the premise of ensuring quality and reducing costs, so that products can truly achieve high quality and low prices. Reducing product quality is the greatest waste.
    The meeting reviewed Shanghai's past production increase and thrift campaign and believed that the main shortcoming in the past work was formalism, and the movement could not be well integrated with the actual situation of the enterprise, so it was not consolidated. This time, each enterprise must carry out the work on the basis of carefully reviewing the past work, and do not simply rely on the instructions of the higher authorities, but proceed from the actual situation of the enterprise to find a correct way to carry out the production increase and thrift campaign.
    The meeting called on all undertakings and enterprises in Shanghai to oppose the phenomenon of extravagance and waste, especially leading cadres and Communist Party members at all levels, to share weal and woe with the masses, care about the hardships and thoughts of the masses, and not to turn themselves into "special figures." We must resolutely streamline institutions and overcome the current undesirable phenomenon of excessively bloated institutions.

    中共上海市委决定开展增产节约运动
    多方寻找原料　大力增加生产
    本报上海9日电　中共上海市委在最近召开的全体（扩大）会议上，决定在上海大力开展增产节约运动，努力增加生产，并以积极精神与原料不足的困难进行斗争。
    会议指出上海增产节约运动的首要任务必须放在积极增加生产方面。因为上海工业生产的潜力很大，而明年由于社会购买力的提高，市场供应将比今年更紧张，因此凡社会所需要的工业品，上海的工业部门一定要努力增产。会议指出，增加生产的关键首先是要以积极精神从多方面着手来解决原材料不足的困难，不要单纯地伸手向上级要。也不要在原料不足的困难前面退缩。会议详细地研究分析了争取钢铁等各种原材料的来源，认为争取更大的材料来源是可能的。例如上海及附近地区可以搜集的废旧钢铁数量还很可观。安徽、浙江、湖南等地均有用土法开采的土铁可以利用，如果局部地施用机器，开采量还可以增加。上海的钢铁厂明年已决定由中央和地方投资扩建，就可以增加一部分产量。克服工业生产中原材料的浪费，也是重要的一环。例如上海出产的缝纫机，它的钢铁用量比一些工业先进国家生产的缝纫机几乎要多一倍。会议号召工业部门的设计人员提高设计水平，纠正目前产品设计中原材料耗用过多的现象，合理地节约原料。
    会议指出上海的轻重工业部门都要注意利用废旧原料。上海的广大中小工厂有利用废旧料的丰富经验，应当发扬这种好的传统。工业部门还要合理地来提倡使用代用品，例如用塑料来代替某些钢铁原料。
    会议决定要组织起一个很大的力量，来进行从多方面争取原料来源的斗争。会议将建议上海市国家计划委员会增设一个副主任，来具体负责领导这个工作。
    开展增产节约运动的另一关键是要真正的把先进生产者运动开展起来，进行企业的技术改造，克服过去先进生产者运动中的形式主义作风。
    会议还强调增加生产必须在保证质量和降低成本的前提下进行，使产品真正做到价廉物美。产品质量的降低就是最大的浪费。
    会议检查了过去上海的增产节约运动，认为过去工作中的主要缺点是形式主义，运动不能很好结合企业实际，因而不巩固。这次各企业一定要在认真检查过去工作的基础上来进行，不要单纯地依赖上级的指示，要从企业的实际出发，找出一条开展增产节约运动的正确道路。
    会议号召上海各事业、企业单位要反对铺张浪费现象，特别是各级领导干部和共产党员，要与群众同甘共苦，关心群众的疾苦和思想状况，不要把自己变成“特殊人物”。一定要坚决地精简机构，克服目前机构过于臃肿庞大的不良现象。
