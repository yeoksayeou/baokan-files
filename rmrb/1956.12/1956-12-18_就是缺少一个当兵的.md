    Just Lacking a Soldier
    Chen Yuting is a member of the Qunlian Cooperative in Huangpo County, Hubei Province. He is already the father of five sons, but he has the same feelings as a young man. His eldest and second sons are workers, the third is a farmer, and the other two are in school. Last year, he sent his third son to enlist, but he was not approved due to poor health, which made him very unhappy. Since then, he has focused his attention on his fourth son, Zhenguo, telling him to exercise well and prepare to enlist. Now, after hearing the news of the conscription, he is very happy and says proudly: My family has workers and farmers, just lacking a soldier. This time, I guarantee Zhenguo will be qualified and become a family of workers, peasants, and soldiers!

    就是缺少一个当兵的
    陈玉廷是湖北省黄坡县群联社的社员，已经是五个儿子的爸爸了，但他具有和年轻人同样的心情。他的大儿子、二儿子都是工人，老三务农，另外两个都在学校念书。去年，他送第三个儿子应征，因为身体不好没被批准，心里很不愉快。自此，他就把注意力集中在第四个儿子真国的身上，叫他好好锻炼身体，准备应征。现在，他听到征兵的消息后，心里非常高兴，自豪地说：我家工人、农民都有，就是缺少一个当兵的。这回保证真国够格，成为工农兵的家庭！
