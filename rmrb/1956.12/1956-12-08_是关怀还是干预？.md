　　Is it Care or Interference?
　　Luo Xiaozhi
　　One evening, several comrades were chatting in the dormitory of the Lion Beach construction site's guest house. After much rambling, the topic turned to the love and marriage problems of young men and women. Comrades who had been at the construction site for a long time told several short stories. In the end, both the storytellers and the listeners were very angry.
              (I)
　　A female tractor driver on the construction site was beautiful and worked actively. As a result, the female tractor driver's master fell in love with the girl.
　　It is not strange for a master to love a disciple, but what is strange is the master's means of love. The master hinted to the apprentice: if you love me, you can learn the technique. Otherwise, you will not learn it. This kind of courtship is difficult to accept. The female tractor driver did not express love, nor did she express not loving him. Later, the girl fell in love with another young man. The master was unhappy when he found out, and the leaders of the engineering team were also unhappy, saying that the female tractor driver's attitude towards love was not correct. She should not be allowed to continue driving the tractor and should be asked to guard the gasoline depot. Leaving the tractor was a very sad thing for the female tractor driver. The female tractor driver then said to the leaders: "My attitude towards him has never changed." When the project was about to end, under the instigation of others, the master proposed marriage to the apprentice. The female tractor driver raised her eyebrows and said, "Okay, but I have one condition: I will marry you when I become an engineer."
                (II)
　　A female welder had close relations with a man on the construction site. As such, some people looked down on him, saying that the man was "frivolous and had a glib tongue;" however, no more flaws could be found. The female welder was applying to join the Party, and some people in the Party organization made well-intentioned "suggestions" and "admonitions" to her, asking her to find another lover, and treating this as a condition for assessing her Party membership. In this way, the problem became serious: if she loved him, she could not join the Party; if she wanted to join the Party, she could not love him. As the project was about to end, the female welder needed to make a decisive decision. Finally, the female welder made a decision and immediately went to register for marriage with the man. She said, "Let's get married first."
          (III)
　　The last story is even more subtle. A dispatcher on the construction site wrote a love letter to a female nurse. Unfortunately, the letter fell into the hands of others and was made public, saying that the female nurse did not love the dispatcher at all, and this was a hard pursuit. In order to punish the dispatcher's "rude behavior," the leaders of the dispatch room asked the dispatcher to make a self-criticism. Moreover, they had to dig out some "thoughts." As a result, the dispatcher had to make self-criticisms again and again, both verbally and in writing. Later, his self-criticism was finally approved.
　　There are many such short stories. Although only three are written here, the matter is already very clear: when young men and women deal with their love and marriage issues, some third parties often appear. It cannot be said to be a bad thing for leaders to show concern for the love and marriage issues of young staff members; but is this kind of "concern" as described above correct? (Attached picture)

### 是关怀还是干预？

　　是关怀还是干预？
　　罗小志
    有天晚上，在狮子滩工地招待所的宿舍里，有几个同志在聊天。七扯八扯，把话题引到了青年男女的恋爱和婚姻问题上。久住工地的同志们讲了几个小故事。末了，无论是讲的，听的，都很气愤。
              （一）
    工地上的一个女拖拉机手，模样漂亮，工作积极，于是女拖拉机手的师傅就爱上了这个姑娘。
    师傅爱徒弟并没什么奇怪的，奇怪的是这位师傅的恋爱的手段。师傅向徒弟暗示：爱我，你就能学到技术。否则，就学不到。这种求爱的方式，是很难令人接受的。女拖拉机手没有表示爱，也没有表示不爱。后来，这位姑娘跟另外一个青年有了爱情，师傅知道了不高兴，工程队的领导人员同样不高兴，说女拖拉机手的恋爱态度不正确，不能叫她继续开拖拉机，应当叫她去看守汽油库。离开拖拉机，对女拖拉机手来说，是多么伤心的事情。女拖拉机手便向领导人员表示：“我对他的态度一直没有变。”工程快要结束的时候，在别人怂恿之下师傅向徒弟提出了结婚的要求。女拖拉机手，把眉毛一扬，说：“可以，不过我有一个条件：等我当了工程师再结婚。”
                （二）
    一个女电焊工，和工地上的一个男的往来密切。就这样，有人看不上眼了，说这个男的“作风轻浮，长着一张能说会道的嘴”；但是，也挑不出更多的缺陷来。这个女电焊工正申请入党，党组织中有人就对她提出了善意的“建议”和“忠告”，要她另找个爱人，并且把这件事作为考核她入党的一个条件。这样，问题就严重了，爱他，就不能入党；要入党，就不能爱他。工程快结束的时候，需要这个女电焊工当机立断。最后，这个女电焊工下了决心，马上同男的一块去登记结婚。她说：“结了婚再说。”
          （三）
　　最后的这个故事就更加微妙。工地上的一个调度员给个女护士写了一封求爱的信，不幸这封信落到了别人的手里，并且当众公开了，说这个女护士根本不爱调度员，这是硬追。为了惩罚这个调度员的“无礼举动”，调度室的领导人就叫调度员作检讨。并且非挖出点什么“思想”不可。于是，调度员只得一次再一次地检讨，口头的，书面的。后来，他的检讨总算是被通过了。
    像这类小故事是很多的，虽然这里只写了三个，但是，事情已经很清楚，青年男女们在处理自己的恋爱、婚姻问题时，经常有些第三者出现。领导人员对青年工作人员的恋爱、婚姻问题表示关怀，不能说是件坏事情；可是像上面这种“关怀”是对的吗？（附图片）
