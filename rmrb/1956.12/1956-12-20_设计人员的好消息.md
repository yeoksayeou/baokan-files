    Good News for Designers
    (Reported by this newspaper) The Standard Design Institute of the State Construction Commission has collected over 5,000 standard designs and reusable individual designs in basic construction from both domestic and international sources. The content is divided into ten categories, including industrial buildings, civil buildings, water supply and drainage, heating and ventilation, power transmission and lighting, and non-standard equipment.

    Recently, 140 new standard designs have arrived from the Soviet Union, including underground reinforced concrete water storage tanks of various volumes, fire truck garages of various capacities, etc.

    In addition to the above blueprints, there are also catalogs of technical data that are generally applicable to most industrial and mining enterprises and design departments.

    To facilitate the exchange and utilization of these design materials, the Standard Design Institute has opened a blueprint and data reading room. Design institutions, academic organizations, and engineering and technical personnel can go to read them with a letter of introduction from their organizations.

    设计人员的好消息
    本报讯　国家建设委员会标准设计院搜集了国内外基本建设方面的标准设计和可以重复使用的单独设计约五千多项，内容分工业建筑、民用建筑、给水排水、采暖通风、输电照明、非标准设备等十大类。
    最近又从苏联新到了一百四十项标准设计，有各种容积的地下钢筋混凝土储水池、各种容量的汽车消防车库等。
    除上列各种蓝图以外，还有各工矿企业和设计部门大部分可以通用的技术资料目录。
    为了使这些设计资料得到交流利用，标准设计院开辟了一个图纸资料阅览室。各设计机构、学术机关和工程技术人员拿着机关介绍信，就可以前去阅览。
