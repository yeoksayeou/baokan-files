    “Our plan to raise 20,000 pigs in one cooperative is about to be realized”
    The Communist Party Committee of Yanggu County, Shandong Province
    The pig raising plan formulated by the Shimensong Township Agricultural Cooperative, particularly the execution of the plan, was not smooth sailing. The cooperative members were afraid of not having money to buy pigs, afraid that the pigs would not have enough to eat, afraid of the trouble, afraid of not making money, etc. In response to this thinking, the Party branch and the cooperative's management committee, through summarizing past production, used accounting methods to explain to the cooperative members the benefits of raising pigs for manure, analyzed the favorable conditions for raising a large number of pigs, and helped each cooperative member formulate a pig raising plan, thereby launching the pig raising and manure accumulation work.
    How to solve the source of piglets? (1) Develop as many sows as possible, and correspondingly develop boars. All of the original 520 large sows and more than 200 small sows were not castrated, allowing them to breed, and from the bred small sows, select those that qualify to be kept as sows. By October, the number of sows capable of breeding had increased to 1,407; the number of boars had increased to 47. (2) Select breeding sows and breeding boars. In addition to purchasing excellent breeds of pigs such as Soviet Large White pigs and Yorkshire pigs, the main selection is from local breeds. According to the principle of "large mother, fat offspring," pay attention to selecting those with small heads, small ears, large eyes, wide mouths, short faces with few wrinkles, necks with plenty of meat, flat backs, round buttocks, long waists, large bellies, straight hooves, and many teats to be kept as sows; select those with double ridges and backs, long bodies and small bellies, fast eating, and energetic to be kept as breeding boars. (3) Adopt the "double mating method" and the "crossbreeding method" for breeding. The double mating method involves using one sow and two boars of different or the same breeds, each mating once, with an interval of about ten minutes between the two matings. This method can improve the conception rate and produce more piglets; the crossbreeding method involves using foreign improved breed boars to mate with local sows. The advantage of this is that the piglets born are larger, grow faster, gain weight easily, and can adapt to the local environment. Using these two methods, ordinary sows give birth to sixteen or seventeen piglets per litter, with the most giving birth to twenty-five. (4) The piglets bred by the cooperative's publicly raised sows are first used to meet the needs of the cooperative, and then sold. The piglets born from privately raised sows by cooperative members are sold to cooperative members who have no pigs or few pigs at the market price.
    After the pig raising work was launched, there was a period of feed shortage. Buying from other places was not only difficult but also expensive. Therefore, the cooperative committee, on the one hand, organized women and children to collect wild vegetables and grasses, and on the other hand, intercropped a large amount of radishes in the pumpkin fields, which solved the difficulty of vegetable and feed shortages. In the summer and autumn seasons, there were coarse feeds everywhere. During this valuable season, in addition to eating and using them at any time, it is necessary to collect and store the coarse feeds needed in winter and early spring: (1) The by-products of the twelve crops planted by the cooperative include: seedlings, leaves, vegetables, shells, chaff, bran, tassels, etc., a total of twenty-three types, totaling 3.93 million jin. (2) In the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, vigorously collect wild grasses and vegetables that grow everywhere, such as rice wormwood, oilseed rape, shepherd's purse, bitter vegetable seedlings, husband seedlings, apricot kernel seedlings, broomgrass, buckshot grass, hornet vegetables, curved buds, dandelions, grandma sour, water radish seedlings, and vines, etc., more than eighty types, storing about 100,000 jin. (3) There are 26,240 miscellaneous trees in the cooperative. In addition to collecting and feeding them at any time, it has also collected 490,000 jin of leaves from thirteen types of trees such as elm, jujube, apricot, pear, peach, poplar, ailanthus, willow, and locust. The above types totaled 4.57 million jin. This winter, a total of 2.06 million jin are needed, and 6 million jin are needed before May of the lunar calendar in 1957, for a total of 8.06 million jin. In addition to what is already available, there is still a shortage of 3.49 million jin. It is planned to intercrop 1,000 mu of radishes in the pumpkin fields next spring (growth period of only 45 days), stems and tassels can produce 1.5 million jin, 500,000 jin of newly grown wild vegetables, grasses, and leaves will be collected in spring and summer; 50 mu of alfalfa, which can be harvested 20,000 jin next spring; 1.46 million jin of distiller's grains will be purchased.
    In addition to coarse feed, there must also be an appropriate amount of concentrated feed. Before May of next year, a total of 2.94 million jin of concentrated feed are needed. The sources are: carrots, white radishes, and sweet potatoes, which can replace 1.1 million jin of concentrated feed; 1.5 million jin (dry) of sweet potato flour residue obtained from grinding sweet potato flour, which can replace 300,000 jin of concentrated feed; 900,000 jin of feed reserved by the cooperative and cooperative members; 520,000 jin of oilseed cakes will be purchased; about 130,000 jin of cornmeal and bran left over from cooperative members grinding flour.
    In this way, all the fine and coarse fodder needed for raising pigs will be solved.
    To develop the pig raising industry, in addition to public raising by the cooperative, it is also necessary to mobilize cooperative members to raise pigs at home. In this way, the burden of large-scale centralized public raising can be reduced, the difficulty of cooperative members' pocket money can be solved, all cooperative members can be promoted to accumulate manure, and it can be guaranteed that more than 90% of cooperative members increase their income. However, attention should also be paid to solving the following specific problems: (1) Adopt an overall planning method to solve the feed problem for privately raised pigs. When collecting tree leaves, wild vegetables, and grasses, take care of cooperative members who raise pigs, and specifically help cooperative members formulate a plan for collecting coarse feed at home. At the same time, appropriately distribute a portion of concentrated feed and by-products of crops to cooperative members so that cooperative members can obtain the necessary concentrated feed. (2) Solve the difficulties of cooperative members raising pigs in terms of funds and other aspects. After the entire cooperative conducted a comprehensive survey, the most difficult cooperative members were 84 households. The agricultural cooperative took out piglets at the lowest market price and let them raise them. After raising them into fat pigs or selling the piglets they gave birth to, the price will be recovered. Loans and credit of piglets were used to help 147 households with temporary difficulties; the principal and interest will be recovered during the summer and autumn distribution. In addition to the above methods of assistance, 69 cooperative members who are orphans, elderly, weak, sick, disabled, and have no labor force were also helped to build pig houses. In this way, all the difficulties for cooperative members to raise pigs were solved. (3) Adjust the manure price. Since the beginning of spring, the price of manure purchased by the cooperative has been increased by 15% on the basis of the original price, which has greatly stimulated cooperative members to raise pigs at home. (4) Help improve feeding techniques. With the development of cooperative members' household pig raising business, it is necessary to improve the methods of feeding management: (1) Each pig farm will help cooperative members in different areas to improve feeding techniques, absorb them to participate in meetings on feeding, feeding, and feeding, and invite them to visit the site; (2) Pay attention to epidemic prevention work, regardless of whether pigs are raised by the cooperative or cooperative members' families, uniformly disinfect and uniformly prepare epidemic prevention and other supplies; (3) Organize experienced breeders and household pig raising experts from the cooperative to conduct household on-site guidance and assistance.
    The cooperative has made great achievements in developing pig raising in the past year. Excluding the 4,200 piglets and 1,050 fat pigs sold, by November 20, the number of publicly raised pigs in the cooperative had increased to 4,457; the number of privately raised pigs by cooperative members had reached 10,416. There are a total of 14,873 publicly and privately raised pigs. By the end of the year, 613 sows can still give birth to a litter of piglets each, with an average of at least ten piglets per litter. It is entirely possible to realize the plan to develop 20,000 pigs in 1956.
    The rapid development of pigs not only guaranteed agricultural production, but also gave full play to the potential of labor. Although agricultural production suffered from natural disasters such as drought, flood, insects, and wind to varying degrees this year, it still increased by 20% compared to last year due to sufficient manure. The profit from raising pigs alone was more than 288,000 yuan, accounting for 30.6% of agricultural income. 1,500 fat pigs can be sold throughout the year (more than 1,100 have been sold). Cooperative members not only increased their actual income, but also ate an average of one jin more meat per person than last year. Therefore, the following sentences are circulating among cooperative members: "Pigs in groups, pens like villages, manure piles like mountains; make money and fertilize fields, grain money is endless; eat meat and support, it is not difficult to build industry." Fully reflects the joy of the cooperative members. (Originally published in the eighth issue of "Rural Work Communication," slightly modified by the editor of this newspaper)

    “我们一个社要养猪两万头”的计划就要实现
    中共山东省阳谷县委员会
    石门宋乡农业社制定养猪计划，特别是执行计划，并不是一帆风顺的。社员们怕没钱买猪，怕猪没吃的，怕麻烦，怕赚不了钱，等等。针对这种思想，党支部和社的管理委员会，通过总结往年生产，用算账的办法向社员说明了养猪积肥的好处，分析了大量养猪的有利条件，并帮助各社员制定了养猪计划，从而把养猪积肥工作开展起来。
    如何解决仔猪的来源呢？（一）尽多地发展母猪，相应地发展种猪。原有的大母猪五百二十头，小母猪二百余头，一律没有阉割，让它们繁殖，并从繁殖的小母猪中，挑出合格的留作母猪。至10月份能繁殖的母猪已增加到一千四百零七头；种猪增加到四十七头。（二）选择种母猪与种公猪。除购来苏联大白猪、约克夏等优良种猪外，主要是从本地选择。根据“母大子肥”的道理，注意挑选小头、小耳朵、大眼、宽嘴、脸短皱少、脖子肉多、脊背平、屁股圆、腰长腹大、蹄直、奶头多的留作母猪；挑选双脊双背、身长肚小、吃食快、有精神的留作种公猪。（三）采取“双重配种法”和“种猪杂交法”进行繁殖。双重配种法，就是用一只母猪与不同品种或同品种的两只公猪，各行交配一次，两次交配中间相隔十分钟左右。这种办法能提高受胎率，多生小猪；种猪杂交法，是用外来的良种公猪配本地的母猪。它的好处是生的小猪个子大、长的快、易上膘，并能适应本地环境。采用这两种办法，一般的母猪每窝都生十六、七头小猪，最多的一窝生二十五头。（四）社内公养母猪所繁殖的小猪，首先满足本社需要，而后出售。社员私养母猪所生的小猪，按市价卖给没猪或猪少的社员。
    养猪工作开展起来后，曾一度发生饲料困难。到外地收买，不仅难买而且价钱昂贵。于是，社委一面组织妇女儿童采集野菜、野草，一面在金瓜地内大量套种萝卜，解决了饲菜饲料的困难，夏秋两季到处都是粗饲料，在这种宝贵季节里，除随时吃用之外，必须收藏起冬季与春初需用的粗饲料：（一）全社种植的十二种农作物的副产品有：秧、叶、菜、壳、秕、糠、缨等二十三种，共产三百九十三万余斤。（二）在春、夏、秋三个季节里，大力采集遍地丛生的野草、野菜，如米蒿、榨草、荠荠菜、苦菜棵、夫苗秧、杏仁子棵、扫帚菜、枪子棵、蚂蜂菜、曲曲芽、蒲公英、婆婆酸、水萝卜棵、交葛兰等八十余种，收藏了约有十万余斤。（三）全社有二万六千二百四十棵杂树，除随时采集喂用之外，还收存起榆、枣、杏、梨、桃、杨、椿、柳、槐等十三种树叶四十九万余斤。以上几种共收藏起四百五十七万余斤。今冬共需二百零六万斤，1957年旧历5月前需六百万斤，总共需八百零六万斤。除了已有的，还缺三百四十九万斤。计划明春在金瓜地内套作萝卜一千亩（成长期仅四十五天），茎与缨可产一百五十万斤，春、夏两季采集新生野菜、野草、树叶等五十万斤；苜蓿五十亩，明春可割二万斤；买酒糟一百四十六万斤。
    除了粗料，还必须有适量的精料。至明年5月前共需精料二百九十四万余斤。其来源：胡萝卜、白萝卜、地瓜，能顶精料一百一十万斤；磨地瓜粉所得粉渣一百五十万斤（干的），能顶精料三十万斤；社内和社员的自留饲料九十万斤；买油饼五十二万斤；社员磨面剩下的糁、皮约有十三万斤。
    这样，养猪所需要的精、粗饲草饲料就全部解决了。
    要发展养猪业，除了社公养以外，还必须发动社员家庭养猪。这样，可以减轻大量集中公养的负担，解决社员零用钱的困难，推动全体社员积肥，保证90％以上社员增加收入。但是，还要注意解决如下一些具体问题：（一）采取统筹兼顾的办法解决私养猪的饲料问题。在采集树叶、野菜、野草的时候，对养猪的社员加以照顾，并具体帮助社员订出家庭采集粗饲料的计划。同时，要把精料和农作物的副产品，适当地分给社员一部分，使社员得到必要的精饲料。（二）解决社员养猪的资金和其他方面的困难。经过全社排队摸底，最困难的社员有八十四户，农业社按最低的市价拿出仔猪，让他们喂养。喂成肥猪或生了小猪卖以后，再收回价款。对临时困难的一百四十七户，采取了贷款和赊给仔猪的办法加以帮助；夏、秋分配的时候，收回本息。对孤寡、老弱、病残等无劳力的六十九户社员，除用以上办法扶助外，还帮助他们修盖了猪舍。这样一来，就把社员喂养生猪的困难全部解决了。（三）调整粪价。入春以来，社内收买粪肥的价款在原有基础上提高了15％，这对刺激社员家庭养猪起了很大作用。（四）帮助改进喂养技术。随着社员家庭养猪事业的发展，需要改进喂养管理的办法：（1）各猪场分片帮助社员提高喂养技术，吸收他们参加研究喂养、调料等会议，并邀请他们实地参观；（2）注意防疫工作，不论社或社员家庭喂养的猪，统一消毒，统一筹备防疫等用品；（3）组织合作社的有经验的饲养员和社员家庭养猪能手进行分户实地指导、帮助。
    该社一年来发展养猪是有很大成绩的。除去卖出的四千二百余头仔猪和一千零五十头肥猪外，至11月20日全社公养猪已增加到四千四百五十七头；社员私养猪已达一万零四百一十六头。公、私共有生猪一万四千八百七十三头。至年底六百一十三头母猪还能各生小猪一窝，每窝平均至少有十头。实现1956年发展养猪两万头的计划是完全有把握的。
    生猪的迅速发展，不仅保证了农业增产，而且充分发挥了劳动潜力。今年农业生产虽遭到了不同程度的旱、涝、虫、风等自然灾害，但由于粪肥足，仍比去年增产二成。仅养猪获利就收入二十八万八千余元，占农业收入的30.6％。全年可以出售肥猪一千五百头（已出售一千一百余头），社员不但增加了实际收入，而且每人比去年平均可多吃到一斤肉。因此社员中流传这样几句话：“猪成群，圈如村，粪堆似山群；又赚钱，又肥田，粮钱用不完；又吃肉，又支援，建设工业不费难。”充分反映了社员的喜悦心情。（原载“农村工作通讯”第八期，本报编者在文字上略有修改）
