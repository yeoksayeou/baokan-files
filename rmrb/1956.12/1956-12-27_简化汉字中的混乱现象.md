    Confusion in Simplified Chinese Characters

    Since the simplification of Chinese characters, it has provided much convenience for the masses in writing and reading. However, many people do not follow the regulations and arbitrarily use homophones to replace simplified characters. Not only is this practice not criticized, but others are imitating it, so typos seem to have become legitimate, appearing in announcements, signs, letters, etc.

    A student I hadn't seen for over a decade sent a letter from "无夕" [Wu Xi]. Where is "无夕"? I checked the postmark and realized it was "无锡" [Wuxi]. My child is in elementary school. One day, I checked his workbook and found many strange surnames and names, such as "宋学千" [Song Xue Qian], "共玉方" [Gong Yu Fang], etc. I asked him and learned that they should be "宋学谦" [Song Xueqian], "龚毓芳" [Gong Yufang]. I said that "龚" [Gong] cannot be simplified to "共" [Gong], and "谦" [Qian] cannot be simplified to "千" [Qian]. He said, "Didn't the Tianjin Second Cultural Palace abbreviate '舞会' [dance party] as '午会' [noon meeting]?"

    In Tianjin, a large sign reads "天津市福利公司里发训练班" [Tianjin Municipal Welfare Company Inside Hairdressing Training Class], so various barbershops have also begun to imitate the use of the words "里发" [Li Fa - Inside Hairdressing]. On the voter list in Xinli Village, eastern suburb of Tianjin, the surname "夏" [Xia] was written as "下" [Xia], and the surname "窦" [Dou] was written as "豆" [Dou]; the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Mill had a "井卫队" [Jing Wei Team - Well Guard Team].

    State organs and enterprises openly use homophones with different meanings to replace simplified characters, and many people follow suit. If this is not corrected in time, there is a possibility of disrupting the Chinese characters over time. It is suggested that relevant departments pay attention. Zhang Gaofeng

### 简化汉字中的混乱现象

    简化汉字中的混乱现象
    汉字简化以来，在写和阅读方面都给人民群众许多便利。但是，也有许多人不按照规定，任意使用同音字代替简化字。对这种做法，不但无人指责，反而有人仿效，于是别字似乎已经成为合法，见诸公告、招牌、信件等。
    一个十多年不见的学生从“无夕”来了一封信。“无夕”在什么地方？我查看邮戳才知道是“无锡”。我的孩子在小学读书，有一天，我查看他的练习本，发现许多怪姓怪名，例如“宋学千”、“共玉方”等等。我问了一下，才知道应该是“宋学谦”、“龚毓芳”。我说“龚”不能简为“共”、“谦”不能简为“千”。他说：“天津第二文化宫不是把‘舞会’简写为‘午会’吗？”
    天津有一个大招牌写着“天津市福利公司里发训练班”，于是各理发店也就模仿使用起“里发”两字。天津东郊新立村的选民榜上把姓“夏”的写成“下”，把姓“窦”的写成“豆”；国营天津第二棉纺厂出现了“井卫队”。
    国家的机关、企业公开用同音异义字代替简化字，许多人也跟着这样做，如果不及时纠正，日久天长有把汉字搞乱的可能，建议有关部门注意。　张高峰
