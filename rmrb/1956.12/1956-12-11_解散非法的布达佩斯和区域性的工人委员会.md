Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 10th: The Hungarian radio station broadcast last night a statement from the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government regarding the measures taken by the government in response to the hostile activities of certain regional workers' councils.

    The statement said that the government agreed to establish workers' councils in industrial enterprises and had promulgated decrees regarding their activities. The government gave support to the workers' councils and was willing to rely on them. However, several days ago, without prior government consent, some regional workers' council organizations were established. The Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government does not recognize such organizations.

    The government's statement pointed out that the Budapest Central Workers' Council had attempted to only concern itself with political issues, attempting to establish new state power organs.

    The Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government declared the Budapest and other regional workers' councils to be illegal organizations and ordered them to cease their activities. At the same time, the government instructed the relevant ministries to provide support to the factory workers' councils.
