　　Correcting the Tendency of "Closing the Door to Settle Accounts"
　　Hunan Strengthens Leadership Over Distribution Work
　　Changsha Dispatch: Party committees at all levels in Hunan Province are strengthening their leadership over the distribution work of agricultural cooperatives. Distribution work in the province began in late October and has now been fully launched. In the previous stage, many cadres had an insufficient understanding of the importance of distribution work. Satisfied with the achievements of early and mid-season rice pre-distribution, they universally exhibited a tendency to "close the door to settle accounts," neglecting ideological education work for the vast number of cooperative members. As a result, many members developed some doubts. Many problems in distribution work can only be solved by mobilizing the masses to run the cooperatives democratically. For example, about 15% of the cooperatives in the province have chaotic accounts. Some cooperatives one-sidedly interpreted the principle of "deducting less and distributing more," and in the pre-distribution, they distributed grain that should have been retained for state procurement and the cooperative's public accumulation. Conflicts arose in some cooperatives between teams with increased production and those with reduced production. In some cooperatives, issues such as the remuneration of cooperative cadres have also not been resolved.

　　Recently, party committees at all levels have been strengthening leadership and gradually resolving the above problems. The Chenxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred 230 capable cadres to help 180 cooperatives with chaotic financial work to sort out their accounts. Xupu County established distribution committees in each township to lead the distribution work.

　　Now, the distribution work of agricultural cooperatives in the province has begun to get on the right track. The vast majority of cooperatives have implemented the principle of distribution according to labor, ensuring that 60% to 70% of the income is distributed to the members. After correcting the tendency of "closing the door to settle accounts," 47 agricultural cooperatives in Baiyun Township, Xiangtan County, widely publicized policies to the members, mobilized them to check the accounts, quickly dispelled their concerns, and powerfully promoted winter production.

　　纠正“关门算账”的偏向
　　湖南加强对分配工作的领导
    本报长沙电　湖南省各级党委正在加强对农业社分配工作的领导。这个省的分配工作从10月下旬开始，现已全面展开。前一阶段，不少干部对分配工作的重要性认识不足，满足于早稻、中稻预分的工作成绩，就一度普遍发生关门算账的偏向，忽视对广大社员进行思想教育工作，因而不少社员产生了一些疑虑。分配工作中有很多问题需要发动群众民主办社才能解决。如全省有15％左右的社账目混乱。有部分社片面领会少扣多分的原则，在预分的时候，把应该留下的国家征购的粮食和社内的公共积累也分掉了。有些社内发生了增产队与减产队的矛盾。在有些社中，社干部的报酬等问题也没有解决。
    最近各级党委正在加强领导，逐步解决上述问题。中共辰溪县委抽调了二百三十名得力干部，帮助一百八十个财务工作混乱的社清理账目。溆浦县每个乡都成立了分配委员会，领导分配工作。
    现在，全省农业社分配工作已开始走上正轨，绝大多数社贯彻执行了按劳取酬的原则，保证把60％到70％的收入分到社员手中。湘潭县白云乡四十七个农业社在纠正关门算账的偏向以后，广泛地向社员宣传政策，发动社员查对账目，很快地打消了社员的顾虑，有力地推动了冬季生产。　（高长任）
