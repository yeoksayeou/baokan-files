From Lashio to Mangshi
By our correspondent

The morning of December 12th was particularly lively in Lashio, the capital of the Northern Shan State of Burma. Men, women, and children dressed in beautiful clothes took to the streets, holding the national flags of China and Burma. They were preparing to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai, who was about to arrive at the airport.

Around seven o'clock in the morning, cars carrying welcomers drove to the airport, several miles from the city. From nearby villages, people of various ethnic groups marched for many miles to the airport in groups. Among them were Shan, Burmese, Kachin, Yi, and Palaung people, wearing colorful ethnic costumes. Together with the decorated archways and the two national flags fluttering in the wind, they adorned the airport with vibrant colors.

Overseas Chinese are one of the main groups of residents there. They also came to the airport, holding a large banner that said "Welcome Premier Zhou Enlai." Among them were representatives from several other cities in the Northern Shan State where overseas Chinese live, who had come from afar outside of Lashio.

No less than five thousand people gathered at the small airport to welcome the delegation. This scale was very grand for a city with only one or two thousand people.

We have been familiar with the name Lashio since we were in elementary school. A long time ago, the road from Lashio to Mangshi, a corresponding city in China, was an important channel for friendly exchanges between the people of China and Burma. Now, it still has a very close relationship with the area on the other side of the border. Among the residents of these two regions, there are many relatives or friends. For example, Special Commissioner Su Hongpa of Northern Shan State and Dao Jingban, the governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in our country, are close relatives. Today, when the reporter spoke with Su Hongpa at the airport about Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Lashio, he said with great interest that the people of his state were very happy to see Premier Zhou Enlai because the Chinese people and the people of his state had been very friendly for a long time.

At 9:30 a.m. local time, five planes landed at Lashio Airport in sequence. The last one was the plane carrying Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Ba Swe, who accompanied him. The band played music, and amidst the cheers of five thousand people, Premier Zhou Enlai stepped off the plane and shook hands with the special commissioner, garrison commander, and others who were waiting at the airport. Then, accompanied by Prime Minister U Ba Swe, he reviewed the guard of honor. Eight young women dressed in the finery of four ethnic groups went up to present flowers. Their brightly colored costumes represented the Shan, Burmese, Kachin, and Palaung ethnic groups.

Because the Premier had to drive to the Chinese border town of Wanting that afternoon, the stay in Lashio had to be shortened. After meeting with local military, government, and social leaders one by one, Premier Zhou waved goodbye to the crowd who were enthusiastically applauding and chanting "Long Live China-Burma Friendship," and stepped into a black sedan specially prepared for him with Prime Minister U Ba Swe. The motorcade moved along the highway to Yunnan, which was once busy.

Leaving Lashio, the road was full of rolling hills, dense forests, gurgling streams, and blooming wildflowers, which was refreshing. One section, with rice fields, streams, bamboo forests, and residences, was like the scenery of the mountainous area of ​​Jiangnan in our country. After traveling more than a hundred miles, we reached a plain in the mountains, which belonged to the Xingwei Tusi and was a rich area of ​​the Northern Shan State. Not far past this, the car climbed a large mountain, more than a thousand feet high, with steep slopes, but after turning around the mountainside, a large plain unfolded before us. The towering mountains we saw below were now plains surrounded by some small hills. The place name is Kyaukme, which is an important border town in Burma. There were already thousands of people in the town, lined up on both sides of the street to welcome the delegation. The Premiers got out of the car here to rest and had lunch.

Not far from Kyaukme, the car meandered again between the mountains, winding upwards, and then turned over another major mountain. After that, the mountain gradually slowed down, and the road gradually descended along the mountain. Soon, we could see a small town on the opposite mountain in the distance. This is Wanting, the Chinese border town. We saw red flags waving and people crowding, waiting there to welcome the arrival of the Premiers.

China and Burma are bounded here by the Wanting River. On the other side of the river, there is a small town called Jiugu, which has been destroyed by fire and is now just a patch of weeds.

With the agreement of the two governments, a highway bridge called the Wanting Bridge was repaired here across the Wanting River. Thousands of welcoming teams had been waiting for several hours, most of them coming from distant villages on the border.

At 3:30 in the afternoon, a motorcade appeared on the opposite hillside. The Premiers were coming. When they were about to reach the bridge, the Premiers got out of the car and walked side by side across the bridge. This was a historically significant moment. Dozens of Chinese, Burmese, and foreign reporters rushed to record this historically important event with their cameras.

On the Chinese side of the bridge, Prime Minister U Ba Swe met with the military and government leaders of Yunnan and the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, introduced by Premier Zhou Enlai.

After reviewing the guard of honor, Liu Minghui, the acting governor of Yunnan, delivered a welcoming speech, emphasizing the development of friendly relations between China and Burma, and hoped that this mutual visit by the Premiers of the two countries would further promote friendly relations between the two countries.

Prime Minister U Ba Swe also delivered an enthusiastic speech. His speech repeatedly won applause from the welcoming crowd.

Then, the Premiers walked through two rows of cheering people, got into the car and continued to Mangshi.

Two hours later, Mangshi was also boiling, with elephant-foot drums, waist drums, and gongs and drums sounding in unison. As early as 2:00 p.m., the street leading to Wanting was crowded. People came from all directions, and the two sides of the three-mile-long street from Dapaiwei to the gate of the guesthouse were densely packed.

Not long after 8 o'clock local time, a shout came from the crowd: "Here they come! Here they come!" The lights of the car projected far away through the hazy night. The long string of cars gradually approached along the Yunnan-Burma Highway like a dragon. The first black sedan appeared in the twilight. Applause and cheers immediately covered everything. At the entrance of the city, Prime Minister U Ba Swe and Premier Zhou Enlai got out of the car at the same time and walked shoulder to shoulder through the welcoming archway and into the crowd holding colorful flags and lanterns. Applause, drumbeats, and cheers of "Long Live China-Burma Friendship" resounded in one piece. Wherever the two Premiers went, the climax of the sound wave surged. The Jingpo girls danced happily, the lower grades of Luxi Elementary School forgot their tiredness and jumped around happily, and the Dai lads played the elephant-foot drums even harder. The two Premiers smiled and nodded constantly to the enthusiastic welcomers.

Eighteen minutes later, the two Premiers were already in front of the guesthouse. They turned around, waved to everyone, and shook hands tightly with the Burmese friends who had arrived in Mangshi yesterday and today.

The two Premiers had already entered the guesthouse, and the other distinguished guests who came with them had also entered the guesthouse. The reception staff told everyone more than once: Go back. But people were still reluctant to leave. In front of the guesthouse, elephant-foot drums, small waist drums, gongs, and other musical instruments were beating non-stop.

In the evening, Mangshi was immersed in joy. In the auditorium, Premier Zhou Enlai accompanied the distinguished guests in appreciating local operas and ethnic dances from Yunnan and the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture. On the outer square, thousands of people were watching the movie "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai". At the other end of the square, a drama and dance attracted another crowd. The shops providing snacks and late-night snacks next to the square were overwhelmed. It wasn't until after midnight that the crowds dispersed in all directions.

    从腊戍到芒市
    本报记者
    12月12日的早晨，缅甸北掸邦首府腊戍比往常特别活跃。男女老少都穿戴着漂亮的衣饰，走到街上来，手里拿着中缅两国的国旗。他们是准备到机场欢迎即将到达的周恩来总理的。
    清晨七时左右，一辆辆载着欢迎的人的车就驶向离城几里的机场。从附近乡下，各种民族的人一队队地步行许多里路来到机场，他们中间有掸族人、缅甸人、克钦人、彝人、崩龙人，穿着各色的民族服装，衬着彩楼和迎风飘扬的两国国旗，把机场点缀得彩色缤纷。
    华侨是那里的主要居民之一。他们举着“欢迎周恩来总理”的大幅横旗也来到了机场。在他们中间，有从腊戍以外北掸邦其他几个华侨聚居的城市远道赶来的代表。
    在不大的机场上已经聚集了不下五千欢迎的人群，这样的规模，对只有一两万人口的城市来说，是十分盛大的。
    腊戍这个名字，我们从小学的时候就是熟悉的。很久以前，从腊戍到中国境内相应的一个城市芒市这条路，就是中缅两国人民友好往来的重要通道。现在，它和国境线另一边的地方仍然有着很密切的关系。在这两个地区的居民中间，有不少是亲戚或者好友，例如、北掸邦特别专员苏洪帕和我国德宏傣族景颇族自治州的州长刀京版就是近亲。今天，当记者在机场上同苏洪帕谈到周恩来总理访腊戍的事情时，他兴致勃勃地说，本邦的人民很高兴看到周恩来总理，因为中国人民同本邦人民很久以来就是很友好的。
    当地时间九时三十分。五架飞机顺次降落在腊戍机场。最后一架就是周恩来总理和陪同他前来的吴巴瑞总理的座机。乐队奏起了音乐，在五千人的欢呼声中，周恩来总理走下飞机，和在机场迎候的特别专员、驻军长官等握手。接着，在吴巴瑞总理陪同下，检阅了仪仗队。八个穿着四种民族盛装的四个女青年上去献花。她们艳丽多彩的服饰代表着掸、缅甸、克钦和崩龙四种民族。
    由于总理必须在当天下午乘车到中国边境的畹町。在腊戍的停留不能不缩短。周总理在和当地军政和社会领袖一一见面之后，就向热情地鼓着掌和高呼着中缅友好的人群挥手告别，和吴巴瑞总理踏进了为他特备的一辆黑色的轿车。车队沿着曾经繁忙一时的通云南的公路前行。
    车出腊戍，一路上山峦起伏，林木茂密，淙淙流水，野花盛开，令人心旷神怡。有一处地段，稻田溪水，竹林人家，恰似我国江南山区风光。约行百余里，抵一山中平原，为兴威土司所属，是北掸邦富庶之区。过此不远，汽车就爬上一座大山，高可千尺以上，山势陡削，但转过山腰，眼前又展开一大片平原。原来在下面看到的崇山峻岭，现在变成四周有些不大的山峦的平原。此处地名克盖，是缅边要地。在镇上已有上千群众，排列在街道两旁欢迎。总理们在这里下车休息并吃了午饭。
    离克盖不远，汽车又蜿蜒在山峦之间，曲折而上，又翻过一重大山，之后，山势转缓，车路顺着山势渐渐下行。不久，远远望去已可以见到对山一座小镇。这就是中国边境的畹町了。但见红旗招展，人头攒动，是人群在那里等候欢迎总理们的到达。
    中缅两国在这里以畹町河为界。在河的另一面，有一小镇叫九谷，已毁于大火，现在只有一片荒草。
    经两国政府协议，在这里横跨畹町河修复了一条公路桥梁，叫畹町桥。成千欢迎的队伍已经等候了几个钟头，他们大多是远道从边境各乡村赶来的。
    下午三时半，一队汽车出现在对面的山坡上，总理们来了。快到桥边的时候，总理们走出汽车，并肩步行着从桥上过来。这是有历史意义的一个时刻，几十个中国、缅甸和外国的记者，都争先恐后地用照相机把这一历史上重要的事件记录下来。
    在中国这边的桥头上，吴巴瑞总理经周恩来总理介绍，会见了云南和德宏傣族景颇族自治州的军政首长。
    在检阅了仪仗队之后，云南代理省长刘明辉致了欢迎词，强调中缅友好关系的发展，并且希望两国总理这次的相互访问将更进一步促进两国的友好关系。
    吴巴瑞总理也发表了一篇亲切的演说。他的讲话多次博得欢迎群众的掌声。
    接着，总理们穿过了两列欢呼的人群，走上汽车继续向芒市而去。
    两小时之后，芒市也沸腾起来了，象脚鼓，腰鼓锣鼓响成了一片。早在下午两点多钟、通向畹町的街口就拥挤起来。人群从四面八方走来，从大牌圩到迎宾馆门前三里长的街道两旁，站得密密层层。
    本地时间八时后不久，人群中发出呼声：“来了！来了！”汽车的灯光穿过蒙胧的夜色远远地投射过来。长串的汽车像一条龙似的沿着滇缅公路渐渐近来。第一辆黑色的轿车在暮色中出现了。掌声，欢呼声立即掩盖了一切。在进市口的地方，吴巴瑞总理和周恩来总理同时下了车，肩并肩的走过欢迎的牌坊，走进手举彩旗和花灯的人群中。掌声、鼓声和“中缅友好万岁”的欢呼声响作一片。两位总理走到哪里，声浪的高潮也就涌到哪里。景颇族的姑娘们兴高彩烈地跳起舞来，潞西小学的低年级小朋友们忘记了困倦，高兴得乱蹦乱跳，傣族小伙子们的象脚鼓打得更起劲了。两位总理微笑着，不断的向热情的欢迎者点头。
    十八分钟以后，两位总理已是在迎宾馆门前了。他们回过头来，向大家招手致意，并和昨天、今天先到芒市的缅甸朋友们紧紧的握手。
    两位总理早已走进了迎宾馆，同来的其他贵宾也都已进迎宾馆了，接待人员不只一次的对大家说：回去吧。可是人们还是不肯离开。在迎宾馆门前，象脚鼓、小腰鼓、锣以及其他的乐器不停地敲打。
    晚间，芒市沉浸在欢乐中。在大礼堂里，周恩来总理陪着贵宾们在欣赏云南和德宏傣族景颇族自治州的地方戏曲和民族舞蹈。在外面广场上，上千的群众在观看电影“梁山伯与祝英台”。广场另一端，一台戏剧和舞蹈吸引了另一堆人群。广场旁边供应点心和宵夜的铺子应接不暇。直到午夜过后，人群才向各个方向散去。
