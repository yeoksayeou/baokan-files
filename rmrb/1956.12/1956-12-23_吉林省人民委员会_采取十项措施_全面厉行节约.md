Jilin Provincial People's Committee
Adopts Ten Measures to Fully Practice Economy

(Reported by this newspaper) The Jilin Provincial People's Committee held its ninth administrative meeting on the afternoon of December 20th and decided to adopt ten measures in the provincial directly-affiliated organs to practice economy and fully establish a good style of hard work and plain living. After these ten measures are adopted, 650,000 yuan can be saved in this year's budget expenditure. The ten measures are: 1. Tighten administrative expenses. 2. Cancel the regulation that allows directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus to use private cars to go to and from work. In the future, directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus can take the bus at fixed times and locations, and pay for the fare themselves. They will also not use private cars to attend unified gatherings. 3. Reduce the number of service personnel. All civil servants in the dormitories of cadres above the level of director and deputy director of departments and bureaus will be cancelled. Thirty-seven service personnel will be reduced from the existing service personnel in the provincial directly-affiliated organs. 4. Save on the use of rooms. Vacate about 10% of the existing offices and give them to units that lack rooms; vacate about 20% of the dormitories of directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus and their families to solve the housing difficulties of cadres. 5. Reduce official documents. 6. Reduce unnecessary telegrams. 7. Use the telephone sparingly, and strictly control the use of long-distance calls in particular. 8. Reduce meetings. Resolutely do not hold unnecessary meetings or meetings that can be held or not held, and resolutely oppose unprepared meetings. No matter what kind of professional meeting is held, except in special circumstances, it is not allowed to hold banquets and evening parties, and it is not allowed to issue souvenirs and prizes indiscriminately. 9. Reduce publications. All publications that are not necessary or that can be published or not published will be discontinued. 10. Streamline the organization and reduce the levels. Departments and bureaus that have already established divisions shall not establish sections; those that have already established sections shall not establish divisions. The directors and deputy directors of departments and bureaus who attended the meeting all agreed with these ten measures and expressed that they must take the lead in carrying forward the excellent tradition of hard work and plain living. Li Luoping, Deputy Director of the Supervisory Department, revealed at the meeting the wasteful phenomenon of excessive administrative expenses in the provincial directly-affiliated organs. He cited an example: the administrative business expenses should be seven yuan per person, but the actual expenditure reached seventy-four yuan, more than nine times the amount. He hoped that all units must tighten their expenditures next year and oppose overspending. Governor Li Youwen requested that the provincial directly-affiliated organs generally check the phenomena of extravagance and waste, and detachment from the masses. According to incomplete statistics, the provincial directly-affiliated organs wasted more than 60,000 yuan in the first eleven months of this year due to unnecessary expenses. He severely criticized some units for not actively streamlining their organizations, but instead looking for "tricks" in an attempt to employ more personnel. He pointed out that the phenomenon of some leading cadres being detached from the masses is very serious. If this is not corrected quickly, the consequences will be very dangerous.

    吉林省人民委员会
    采取十项措施　全面厉行节约
    本报讯　吉林省人民委员会12月20日下午举行第九次行政会议，决定在省直属机关采取十项措施，厉行节约，全面树立艰苦朴素的优良作风。采取这十项措施以后，可以节省今年预算开支六十五万元。这十项措施是：一、紧缩行政开支。二、取消厅、局长上下班专用小汽车的规定。今后厅、局长上下班可以在固定时间和地点，乘坐大汽车，车费由自己交付。参加统一性的集会，也不坐小汽车。三、减少勤杂人员。厅、局长以上干部宿舍的公务员，全部取消。要在省直属机关现有勤杂人员中减少三十七名。四、节省用房。在现有办公室中腾出10％左右的房屋，让给缺房的单位；在厅、局长及其家属的宿舍中腾出20％左右的宿舍，解决干部住宿的困难。五、减少公文。六、减少不必要的电报。七、少用电话，尤其要严格控制使用长途电话。八、减少会议。坚决不开不必要的或者可开可不开的会议，坚决反对无准备的会议。不论召开什么专业会议，除特殊情况外，不许举行会餐和晚会，不准滥发纪念品和奖品。九、减少刊物。没有必要的或者可出可不出的刊物，一律停刊。十、精简机构，减少层次。各厅、局已设处的，不得设科；已设科的，不得设处。到会的厅、局长都赞成这十项措施，并表示一定要带头发扬艰苦朴素的优良传统。监察厅副厅长李洛平在会上揭露了省直属机关行政费用超支过多的浪费现象。他举例说：行政业务费每人应为七元，而支出的竟达到七十四元，超过九倍多。他希望各单位明年一定要紧缩开支，反对超支。栗又文省长要求省直属机关要普遍检查铺张浪费、脱离群众的现象。根据不完全的统计，今年十一个月省直属机关因为不必要的开支，就浪费了六万多元。他严厉批评了一些单位目前不积极精简机构，却在找“窍门”，企图多用人员。他指出：现在有些领导人员脱离群众的现象很严重。如果不赶快加以纠正，后果是十分危险的。
