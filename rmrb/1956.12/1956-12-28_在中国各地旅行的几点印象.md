A Few Impressions from Traveling Around China
Hasan Ragab, Ambassador of the Arab Republic of Egypt to China

From December 7th to 19th, 1956, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized a trip to Central and Southern China for the heads of diplomatic missions in China. I was very happy to have the opportunity to participate.

We visited many important places, starting with Shanghai, then Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Zhengzhou, before returning to Beijing. In each place, we were given a brief introduction to the city's work and local conditions by the mayor or his representative, or to the province's situation by the governor.

During this trip, I visited many factories, museums, cultural palaces, workers' clubs, metallurgical and chemical enterprises, as well as the famous Yangtze River Bridge under construction. My impression is that China has made many great achievements since the current government came to power in 1949. The most outstanding achievement, in my opinion, is that China has not only established many new factories, but, more importantly, it is providing its own factories with machinery and equipment. In some factories, I saw that almost 80% of the machines were made in China.

Industrial Production Plan

In terms of plans to increase industrial production, the Chinese government has taken very wise measures:

I. Expanding existing industries by forming joint state-private enterprises through government investment in private industry.

This measure is the most reasonable, because expanding an existing factory is much easier than building a brand-new one. The latter has all kinds of difficulties, such as choosing a site, redesigning and constructing, purchasing new machines, training new workers, and adopting new experiences. These all take a long time to become effective, while expanding existing factories is easier, more economical, and easier to see results.

II. Implementing a multi-shift work system of eight hours per shift to maximize the use of investment. Most of the factories we visited had two shifts, and some even had three shifts.

III. When building new factories, it is extremely important to utilize the technical experience of friendly countries. The great German politician Bismarck said: "The foolish say they learn from their own experience, but I would rather benefit from the experience of others."

Of course, this situation will not last long. Soon, Chinese technicians will accumulate rich knowledge in their work. In the future, their experience will be combined with the research results of Chinese scientists and scholars in laboratories and scientific institutions, and will be developed. Then it will be China's turn to contribute its experience to the world. I dare say that, given the current speed of China's industrial development, that day is not far off. In fact, Chinese engineers are adopting new technologies in many areas, such as the new piling methods used in the construction of the bridge foundation for the Yangtze River Bridge in Wuhan. Once their experiences are published, construction engineers around the world will be able to learn from the achievements of Chinese scientists and engineers.

Benefits Egypt Can Gain from China's Experience

It must be admitted that this trip has provided me with a lot of knowledge, which I hope will help my country not only in industry, but also in agriculture.

During this trip, we traveled 5,500 kilometers by train, mostly through rural areas. I found that many of the agricultural implements used by Chinese farmers have never been seen in Egypt. For example, the simple water-lifting windmill in the suburbs of Shanghai. Such ingenious devices would be very useful for Egyptian farmers near the coast, where farmers still rely on manual labor to draw water.

The size of the hand-operated farm tools is also different from those used in Egypt. It would be a good idea to try these Chinese farm tools in Egypt, as Egyptian farmers will surely benefit from them.

Cooperative System

China's cooperative system is obviously worth studying by Egyptian farmers. The advantage of this system is that it enables better use of manpower, because it allows farmers to specialize in agricultural techniques, thereby improving production.

At the same time, the cooperative system enables small farmers to use efficient modern agricultural machinery; without this system, it would be difficult for them to use it. Compared with private ownership, the operating costs of cooperatives are much lower.

Implementing the cooperative system will fundamentally change the entire face of agricultural cultivation.

Egypt and South China Have Similar Conditions

Egypt is located between 22 and 31 degrees north latitude, so its climate is similar to that of southern China in many ways. Many crops in South China can be successfully transplanted to Egypt, for example:

I. Bamboo, which is known in Egypt, but has never been developed on a large scale like in China. Bamboo is deeply rooted in Chinese life. Bamboo shoots can be cooked into delicious and nutritious food, and bamboo stems can be used to make almost anything, such as houses, fences, agricultural tools, ship masts, etc.

II. Many delicious fruits can be grown in Egypt, such as lychees, which are completely unknown in Egypt.

III. China's experience in using ponds to raise fish is very beneficial to Egypt. I visited an aquatic products hall in Guangzhou and saw many kinds of fish that Egyptian farmers can raise in local ponds. This can increase productivity and make use of Egypt's ponds and lakes that are currently idle, so that they are not left there to become breeding grounds for mosquitoes that transmit diseases.

China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou

In Guangzhou, I visited the China Export Commodities Fair. I was deeply impressed by the variety of goods and the excellent quality. Visitors can easily see that in these short years, China's industrial and agricultural production levels have increased rapidly, and many new products have been produced. This exhibition fully demonstrates that the great China possesses unlimited natural resources that can be mined into rich wealth, which is the pride of the Chinese nation and the pride of their friends all over the world.

I am confident that this exhibition will promote the growing mutual understanding and friendship between China and Asian, African, and other countries around the world to a higher stage.

China's Support for Egypt

During this long journey, I personally saw that every village and city in China supports Egypt. Many slogans and posters supporting Egypt were written on the walls of many train stations. I also saw many factories with huge banners calling on workers to increase production so that China can provide material assistance to Egypt. I understand that many factory workers are working many hours without pay to support Egypt's just cause. I am always convinced that every Chinese person supports Egypt in the depths of their heart.

Egypt is of course very grateful to China for everything it has done to support Egypt. As the saying goes, "A friend in need is a friend indeed." The recent Suez Canal incident has made it clear to Egypt that she can fully trust China's friendship.

Scars Left by Imperialism

China has suffered more from imperialist oppression in the past than any other country. In the many cities we visited, we saw the old scars left by imperialism, which could not help but remind people of the privileges enjoyed by the hateful imperialism in China in the past. Places like the Bund in Shanghai and Shamian in Guangzhou still remind the Chinese people of the humiliation they suffered when they were torn apart by imperialist intervention. The Chinese people only got rid of this foreign intervention after they united under the leadership of the current government. But the imperialists are always ready to look for opportunities for China's weakness to launch an attack on China in order to restore the privileges they lost in China. The Chinese people must never allow imperialism to find such an opportunity. The only way for the Chinese people to prevent imperialist aggression is to remain united under the leadership of the government and do everything possible to increase production. Industrialization is very important to China, not only because industry can meet the needs of the residents' lives, but also because industry is always the pillar of national defense. Unless industry is developed to a level high enough to match the advanced industries of imperialist countries, China will always be threatened by the interference of imperialist countries. The imperialist adventure in Egypt is an example.

Conclusion

The Chinese government has followed a very wise tradition by organizing such trips for foreign diplomats, allowing them to visit various parts of China and see firsthand the progress China has made in all aspects of life. I cannot but express my gratitude to the staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China for their tireless efforts to take care of us in every way to make our trip as comfortable as possible. We were extremely comfortable along the way, and everything on the trip was well managed.

I must admit that this trip was a great education for me. It gave me the opportunity to see many historical sites that are often talked about in books and newspapers; it gave me the opportunity to gain firsthand knowledge of Chinese local affairs from the governors and mayors of Chinese provinces.

This trip has indeed increased my knowledge of Chinese history and made me more interested in Chinese affairs.

I am confident that this trip will enable me to have a broader knowledge and experience, so that I can complete my mission more effectively.

I am also confident that this trip will help Egypt and China get closer.

    在中国各地旅行的几点印象
    埃及共和国驻华大使　哈桑·拉加卜
    1956年12月7日到19日，中国外交部为各国驻华外交使团的代表团长组织了一次到华中和华南各地的旅行。我很高兴，我也能抽空参加。
    我们访问了许多重要地方，最先到上海，接着到广州、武汉、郑州，然后返回北京。所到之处，都由市长或者他的代表向我们简要地介绍了城市工作和当地情况，或者由省长介绍本省情况。
    在这次旅行中，我参观了许多工厂、博物馆、文化宫、工人俱乐部、冶金和化学企业以及正在建设中的著名的长江大桥。我的印象是，自从1949年现政府执政以来，中国已经取得了许多伟大的成就。其中最突出的成就，我认为是，中国不仅已兴办了许多新的工厂，而且更重要的是，中国正在为自己的工厂提供机器装备。在有一些工厂里，我看到几乎80％的机器都是中国自己制造的。
    工业生产计划
    在提高工业生产的计划方面，中国政府采取了非常明智的措施：
    一、以政府入股私营工业，形成公私合营企业的方法来扩大现有工业。
    这一措施是最合理不过的，因为扩大一个现有工厂要比建立一个崭新的工厂容易得多。后者有种种困难，像选择厂址，重新设计、建设，购买新的机器，训练新的工人，采用新的经验等等。这些都需要很长一个时期才能见效，而扩大现有工厂却比较容易，比较经济，也易于见效。
    二、实行八小时一班的多班工作制，最大限度地利用投资。我们参观过的大多数工厂实行两班制，有的甚至实行三班制。
    三、在建设新的工厂时，利用友好国家的技术经验是极其重要的。德国伟大政治家俾斯麦说过：“愚蠢的人说他们从切身经验中学习，但是我宁愿从别人的经验中得益。”
    当然这种情况不会长此下去的。不久，中国技术人员将会在工作中累积丰富的知识。这样，在将来，他们的经验将会和中国科学家、学者在实验室和科学机构中进行研究的成果结合起来，并得到发展，那时就要轮到中国把自己的经验贡献给全世界了。我敢说，以目前中国工业发展的速度来看，这一天是不会太远的。实际上，中国工程师正在许多方面采用新的技术，如像在武汉建设长江大桥的桥基时采用了新的打桩方法。一当他们的经验公布，全世界的建筑工程师将能从中国科学家和工程师的成就中获得教益。
    埃及从中国的经验中可以得到的好处
    必须承认，这次旅行使我获得了不少知识，我希望这不仅在工业方面，而且在农业方面有助于我的国家。
    在这次旅行中，我们乘火车行经五千五百公里，绝大部分地区是田野。我发现，中国农民所使用的许多农具在埃及从未见过。举例说，上海郊区的简单的汲水风车。这样巧妙的器械对于近海的埃及农民一定很有用处，那里的农民今天仍然靠人力来取水。
    手操农具的大小和埃及使用的也不同。在埃及试用这些中国农具是个好主意，埃及农民必能从中获益不少。
    合作社制度
    中国的合作社制度显然是值得埃及农民研究的。这种制度的优越性在于能够更好地使用人力，因为它使农民在农作技术上专业化，从而改进了生产。
    同时合作社制度使小农能够使用效率高的现代农业机械；没有这种制度，他们是很难使用的。和私有制相比较，合作社的经营费用要少得多。
    实行合作社制度将能根本地改变农业耕作的整个面貌。
    埃及和华南有类似条件
    埃及位于北纬22度到31度之间，因此它的气候在许多方面和中国南部是相像的。华南的许多农作物可以成功地移植到埃及去，譬如：
    一、竹子，在埃及是知道的，但是从没有像中国这样得到大规模的发展。竹子深入到了中国人的生活。竹笋可以烹成可口而富于营养的食品，竹茎几乎什么都可以做，如盖房、编篱笆、作农具、船桅等等。
    二、许多美味的水果可以在埃及种植，如荔枝，这在埃及是完全陌生的。
    三、中国利用池塘养鱼的经验对埃及十分有益。我在广州参观了一所水产馆，看到许多种鱼是埃及农民可在本地池塘里饲养的，这可以提高生产率，并且可以把埃及至今闲着的池塘湖泊利用起来，不致像现在那样闲在那里仅仅成为蚊子传染疾病的巢穴。
    广州的中国出口商品展览会
    在广州我参观了中国出口商品展览会。商品种类的繁多和质量的优良给了我很深的印象。参观者可以很容易地就看出，在这短短的几年中，中国的工、农业生产水平有了飞速的提高，并且生产出了许多新的产品。这次展览会充分显示，伟大的中国所拥有的无限自然资源可以挖掘出丰富的财富，这是中华民族的骄傲，也是他们的全世界的朋友们的骄傲。
    我确信，这次展览会将使中国和亚非及世界各国之间日益增长的相互了解和友谊推进到更高的阶段。
    中国对埃及的支持
    在这次长途旅行中，我亲眼看到中国的每个乡村和城市都支持埃及。许多火车站的招贴墙上写着支持埃及的标语和口号等等。我还见到许多工厂内挂着巨幅标语，号召工人增加生产，使中国能给埃及以物质援助。据我了解，许多工厂的工人都无偿地工作许多钟点来支持埃及的正义事业。我始终确信，每一个中国人的心灵深处都是支持埃及的。
    埃及当然很感激中国为支持埃及所作的一切。俗话说：“临难方见真朋友”。最近的苏伊士运河事件使埃及明白她可以完全信任中国的友谊。
    帝国主义留下的伤疤
    中国过去所受的帝国主义压迫比任何国家都多。在访问过的许多城市中，我们看到了帝国主义留下的旧的伤疤，使人不禁想到可恨的帝国主义过去在中国所享有的特权。像上海的黄浦滩、广州的沙面这些地方，仍然使中国人民记起当他们在帝国主义的干涉下四分五裂时，他们所遭受到的屈辱。中国人民只是在现政府的领导下团结起来了以后才摆脱了这种外国干涉。但是帝国主义时刻准备着寻找中国软弱的机会，对中国发动进攻，以恢复他们在中国失去的特权。中国人民决不能容许帝国主义找到这种机会。中国人民防止帝国主义侵略的唯一方法就是在政府领导下保持团结，并尽一切力量增加生产。工业化对中国是非常重要的，不仅是因为工业能够满足居民生活的需要，而且工业始终是国防的支柱。除非把工业发展到足以和帝国主义国家的先进工业相匹敌的高度水平，中国将经常受到帝国主义国家干涉的威胁。帝国主义在埃及的冒险就是一个例子。
    结束语
    中国政府遵循了非常明智的传统，为各国外交家们组织了这样的旅行，使他们能够访问中国各地，亲眼看一看中国在生活的各个方面所取得的进步。中华人民共和国外交部工作人员为了使我们旅行得尽可能地舒服，不辞辛劳地给了我们多方照顾，对此我不能不对外交部表示感谢。我们一路上极为舒适，旅途中的一切事务也管理得井井有条。
    我必须承认，这次旅行对我说来是一次极大的教育。它使我有机会看到许多书报上常常谈到的历史遗迹；它使我有机会从中国的省长和市长们那里获得了关于中国地方事务的第一手知识。
    这次旅行确实是增长了我对中国历史的知识，并使我对中国事务发生更大的兴趣。
    我确信，这次旅行将使我能有更广泛的知识和经验，从而能更有效地来完成我的使命。
    我也确信，这次旅行将有助于埃中两国更加接近起来。
