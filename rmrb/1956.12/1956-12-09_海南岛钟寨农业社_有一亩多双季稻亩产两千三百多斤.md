    Hainan Island Zhongzhai Agricultural Cooperative:
　　Over 2,300 Jin Per Mu of Double-Season Rice

    This newspaper reports that in the Zhongzhai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengmai County, Hainan Island, a 1.25 mu plot of double-season rice paddy yielded an average annual output of 2,306 jin per mu. The cooperative has now basically completed its autumn harvest. The 1,650 mu of late rice yielded 310 jin of rice per mu. Adding the early rice yield, the average annual yield for the whole year reached 590 jin per mu. The total rice output of this cooperative increased by 63% compared with last year, exceeding the annual production increase plan.

    The Zhongzhai Agricultural Cooperative was converted into a higher-level cooperative before the spring plowing this year. It mobilized the strength of the entire cooperative to block a tributary of the Nandu River and dug a ten-li-long canal, irrigating more than 1,000 mu of paddy fields. This year, the cooperative also adopted close planting of small seedlings, increased fertilizer application, and used foreign improved varieties – "Siam Rice" and "Penglai Rice" – in 80% of the paddy fields. These are all important reasons for the bumper harvest of double-season rice in this cooperative.

　　有一亩多双季稻亩产两千三百多斤
    本报讯　海南岛澄迈县钟寨农业生产合作社有一丘一点二五亩双季水稻田平均全年每亩年产量二千三百零六斤。现在该社秋收已基本结束，全社一千六百五十亩晚稻，每亩产稻谷三百一十斤，加上早稻产量，全年平均每亩产量达到五百九十斤。这个社的稻谷总产量比去年增加六成三，超额完成了全年增产计划。
    钟寨农业社在今年春耕前转为高级社，曾经动员全社力量，封堵了南渡江支流，开渠达十里长，灌溉了一千多亩稻田。这个社今年还采取了小棵密植，增加了施肥量，并且80％的稻田采用了外来的良种——“暹稻种”和“蓬莱种”。这些都是这个社的双季稻丰收的重要原因。　（新海南报编辑部）
