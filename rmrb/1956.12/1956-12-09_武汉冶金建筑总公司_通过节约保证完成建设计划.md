Xinhua News Agency Wuhan, December 8th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Feng Jian) reported: The Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company, by strictly controlling the use of construction materials and earnestly mobilizing the masses of workers to seek ways to save materials, completed the state investment plan in October and November under the difficult conditions of construction materials, ensuring the progress of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise construction project. Currently, they are continuing to overcome difficulties and strive to complete the annual plan in the last month of this year.

From October to December, this company needs to complete 45.5% of this year's annual plan for the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction project. When compiling the fourth-quarter construction schedule in mid-September, they discovered that there were many difficulties in terms of construction materials, such as a shortage of more than 1,800 tons of steel. Therefore, the company organized personnel from the construction and material supply departments to inventory the material warehouses and get a clear picture of the situation. On the other hand, they explained the difficult material situation to the workers and mobilized everyone to think of ways to solve the problem together. As a result, mass movements to save construction materials were launched at various construction sites. The more than 200 rationalization proposals put forward by the workers of the Concrete Engineering Company, the steel and cement saved could build a small factory building. Technicians Cai Dehui, Yu Zongmin, and engineer Tang Yunwen revised the design of a cross-line culvert from a reinforced concrete structure to a block stone structure, saving sixty-three tons of steel alone.

The Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company also strictly reviewed the material budgets of each engineering company for the fourth quarter. In the process of review, it reduced the more than 3,000 tons of cement applied for by several units, thus enabling the projects that were originally difficult to construct due to the lack of cement, such as the factory front avenue, residential area roads, and cross-line bridges on the railway, to be constructed.

　　通过节约保证完成建设计划
    据新华社武汉8日电　新华社记者冯健报道：武汉冶金建筑总公司由于严格控制建筑材料的使用，认真发动职工群众寻求节约材料的方法，10月和11月份在建筑材料困难的状况下完成了国家投资计划，保证了武汉钢铁联合企业建设工程的进度。目前，他们正在继续克服困难，争取在今年最后一个月份完成年度计划。
    这个公司从10月到12月需要完成今年武钢建设工程年度计划的45.5％。在9月中旬编制第四季度施工进度计划的时候，他们发现在建筑材料方面存在着许多困难，如钢材就缺少一千八百多吨。因此，公司一方面组织施工部门和材料供应部门的人员，清查材料仓库，摸清家底；另一方面又向职工交代了材料困难的情况，发动大家想办法协力解决。于是，各个工地都开展了群众性的节约建筑材料的活动。混凝土工程公司职工提出的二百多条合理化建议，所节约的钢筋和水泥就可以盖一个小型厂房。技术员蔡德慧、于宗民和工程师唐允文将一项跨线涵洞的钢筋混凝土结构设计修改为砌块石，仅钢筋就节约了六十三吨。
    武汉冶金建筑总公司还严格地审查各工程公司第四季度的材料预算，在审查过程中，削减了几个单位多申请的三千多吨水泥，因而使原来因为缺乏水泥而施工有困难的厂前大道、住宅区道路和铁路上的跨线桥等项工程都能够施工。
