Xinhua News Agency, 26th. A Xinhua News Agency reporter learned from relevant departments: From 1953 to the present, thirty-three newly built and renovated machine manufacturing factories above the quota in our country have been put into production. This marks a major step forward in our country's machine manufacturing industry towards an independent and modern path. These factories, capable of manufacturing important machinery and equipment such as automobiles, ships, large machine tools, medium and large generators, precision electrical instruments, and complete sets of textile machinery, have increased their annual production capacity far beyond the level achieved in the eighty-plus years since China established its modern machinery industry in 1862 before liberation.

After the commissioning of two machine tool production factories, including the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, the annual production capacity of machine tools in our country has increased by more than 4,200 units, with a total weight of more than 19,000 tons. The increased number of machine tools is equivalent to about 78% of the highest annual output of machine tools in our country before liberation in 1941. Because before liberation, the main focus was on manufacturing or assembling small machine tools, the newly added annual production capacity has greatly exceeded the highest annual production level before liberation in terms of weight. The newly commissioned machine tool factories can produce large and medium-sized machine tools and multi-axis automatic machine tools that could not be produced in old China. The annual output can equip six or seven large machinery factories. Also newly commissioned are factories producing equipment such as ball bearings and cutting tools and measuring tools. Among them, the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, which was put into production at the beginning of last year, has produced more than 1,700 specifications of precision cutting tools and measuring tools in the past two years to meet the needs of our country's machinery industry in manufacturing automobiles, machine tools, ships, locomotives, electric meters and other products.

Among the factories put into production, seven are manufacturing transportation equipment or serving transportation. The Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Factory, which was put into production this year, laid the foundation for the development of my country's automobile industry. The factory has an annual automobile production capacity of 30,000 vehicles. Its first batch of automobiles has begun to serve China's construction cause, changing the situation that China's automobiles have completely relied on imports for decades.

After the commissioning of two factories producing electric motors, such as the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, the annual production capacity of generators in our country has increased by 420,000 kilowatts according to the original design plan. Currently, these two factories have produced 15,000-kilowatt hydro-turbine generator sets and 12,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators. According to the current production capacity, these two factories can also produce hydro-turbine generator sets with a unit capacity of 50,000 kilowatts and steam turbine generators with a unit capacity of 25,000 kilowatts as needed. Before liberation, the generator production in 1947, the year with relatively high generator production in our country, was only over 22,000 kilowatts, and the unit capacity did not exceed 500 kilowatts. Some of the newly commissioned factories also manufacture products such as boilers, electrical instruments, cables, internal combustion engines, transformers, steam turbines, and switchboards. Among them, the Shenyang Cable Factory, which was put into production not long ago, can produce several types of high-voltage cables and ultra-high-voltage cables that needed to be imported in the past. These cables, when installed as high-voltage lines, can transmit electricity to distant cities and villages.

Among this batch of newly commissioned factories, six are manufacturing mining and excavating equipment or serving mines. The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, which was built as early as two years ago, supplies various pneumatic tools to more than 200 mines and construction sites across the country. Many rock drilling workers and coal miners in our country have greatly improved their labor productivity and reduced physical labor due to the availability of domestically produced rock drills and pneumatic picks.

Before liberation, our country did not have a factory that truly manufactured textile machinery. The millions of spindles of equipment owned by the textile industry were all imported from abroad. The Jingwei Textile Machinery Factory, our country's largest textile machinery manufacturing factory, which was put into production in 1954, can produce textile machinery equipment with 500,000 spindles annually. For more than two years, the textile machinery produced by this factory together with several other renovated textile machinery factories has not only met the needs of dozens of newly built and renovated textile factories in our country, but also exported some machinery and equipment. Currently, this factory is experimenting with a newly emerging spinning machine in the world. After the research and trial production of this spinning machine is successful, it will advance my country's textile industry to the world's advanced level.

From 1953 to 1956, in addition to the thirty-three machine manufacturing factories that were fully put into production, more than a dozen factories were partially put into production. Therefore, the technical equipment of my country's machine manufacturing industry is constantly increasing. Among them, the number of machine tools owned has more than doubled compared with the early days of liberation.

During my country’s first five-year plan period, there were more than eighty machine manufacturing factories above the quota planned for construction, and most of them are currently under construction. The factories under construction include factories manufacturing tractors, locomotives, ships, machine tools, heavy machinery, large generators, and mining equipment. It is expected that more than a dozen machine manufacturing plants will be put into production next year.

    我国工业的心脏——机器制造业
    四年的发展超过解放以前八十多年
    新华社26日讯　新华社记者从有关部门获悉：从1953年到目前为止，我国已经有三十三个限额以上的新建和改建的机器制造工厂投入生产，这标志我国机器制造工业已经向独立的现代化的道路上迈进一大步。能够制造汽车，船舶，大型工作母机，中型和大型发电机，精密电气仪表，全套纺织机器等重要机器设备的这批工厂，所增加的年产能力，已经远远超过了解放前我国自1862年建立近代化机器工业以来八十多年内所达到的水平。
    包括沈阳第一机床厂在内的两个生产工作母机的工厂投入生产后，使我国工作母机年产能力增加了四千二百多台，总重量一万九千多吨。增加的工作母机台数相当于我国解放前工作母机生产最高的一年1941年产量的78％左右；由于解放前主要是制造或装配小型工作母机，因此按重量计算，新增年产能力已经大大超过了解放前的最高年产水平。新投入生产的机床厂可以生产旧中国不能生产的大型、中型的工作母机和多轴自动的工作母机，每年的产量可以装备六、七个大机器厂。新投入生产的还有生产滚珠轴承、刃具量具等设备的工厂，其中去年年初投入生产的哈尔滨量具刃具厂，两年以来已经生产出一千七百多种规格的精密刃具量具，来满足我国机器工业制造汽车、工作母机、船舶、机车、电表等产品的需要。
    投入生产的这批工厂中，有七个是制造交通运输设备或为交通运输服务的。今年投入生产的长春第一汽车制造厂，奠定了我国发展汽车工业的基础。这个厂的汽车年产能力是三万辆，它的第一批汽车已经开始为我国建设事业服务，改变了几十年来我国所用汽车完全依赖进口的情况。
    哈尔滨电机厂等两个生产电机的工厂投入生产后，按原设计方案，使我国发电机年产能力增加了四十二万瓩。目前，这两个厂已经生产一万五千瓩的水轮发电机组和一万二千瓩的汽轮发电机。按目前生产能力，这两个厂还可以根据需要生产单位容量五万瓩的水轮发电机组和两万五千瓩的汽轮发电机；而解放前我国发电机产量比较高的一年1947年生产的发电机，只有两万二千多瓩，其中单位容量没有超过五百瓩的。新投入生产的工厂中还有一些是制造锅炉、电气仪表、电缆电线、内燃机、变压器、汽轮机、开关板等产品的，其中不久前投入生产的沈阳电缆厂，可以生产几种过去需要进口的高压电缆和超高压电缆。这些电缆安装成高压线路，可以把电力送到很远的城市和乡村。
    这批新投入生产的工厂中，有六个是制造矿山采掘设备或为矿山服务的。早在两年前建成的沈阳风动工具厂，生产的各种风动工具供应了全国两百多个矿山、工地。我国许多矿山凿岩工人和采煤工人，由于得到了国产的凿岩机、风镐，大大提高了劳动生产率，并且减轻了体力劳动。
    我国解放前没有真正制造纺织机器的工厂，纺织工业所拥有的几百万纱锭设备，都是从国外进口的。1954年投入生产的我国最大的纺织机械制造厂——经纬纺织机械厂，每年可以生产五十万纱锭的纺织机器设备。两年多以来，这个工厂同其他几个改建的纺织机械厂一起，所生产的纺织机器不但满足了我国新建、改建的几十个纺织厂的需要，而且还出口了部分机器设备。目前，这个厂正在试验研究一种世界上新出现的细纱机，这种细纱机研究试制成功以后，将把我国纺织工业推进到世界先进水平。
    从1953年到1956年期间，除了全部投入生产的这三十三个机器制造工厂以外，还有十几个厂部分地投入了生产。因此，我国机器制造工业的技术设备正在不断增加，其中只是所拥有的工作母机，目前已比解放初期增加了一倍以上。
    我国第一个五年计划期间计划施工的限额以上的机器制造工厂，共有八十多个，目前绝大部分已经施工。正在施工的工厂中，包括有制造拖拉机、机车、船舶、工作母机、重型机器、大型发电机、矿山设备等产品的工厂。预计明年还将有十多个机器制造厂投入生产。
