Hong Kong Painters' Works Exhibited in Beijing

(Our newspaper's report) The "Hong Kong Painters' Works Exhibition," sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association, opened on the 20th at the auditorium of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. A total of 133 oil paintings and watercolors by eight Hong Kong painters, including Wu Buyun, Yu Ben, Li Liudan, Chen Haiying, Chen Fushan, Xu Dongbai, Huang Chaokuan, and Liang Yinben, are on display.

The exhibited works include landscapes, portraits, and still lifes. Some works reflect the arduous life of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, expressing the painters' deep sympathy for the suffering compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in works such as "Nowhere to Sleep Tonight" and "We Want to Live." Some works reflect the mainland people's concern for the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, as well as the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon's yearning for the construction of the motherland.

The exhibition is scheduled to close on January 10, 1957. (Lu Kaixiang)
