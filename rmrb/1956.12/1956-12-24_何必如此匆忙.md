Guangdong's Qingyuan County, without seriously studying the scope, steps, and organizational leadership of opening up the free market, hastily listed moso bamboo, which should be mostly controlled by the state, as commodities that could be freely traded, causing serious consequences.

Guangdong's Qingyuan County's seventh and eighth districts are rich in moso bamboo. Every year, a large amount of moso bamboo is transported and sold to Guangzhou, Foshan, and other places. Moso bamboo has a wide range of uses: fishermen use it for fishing; bamboo handicraft industries use it as raw material; construction sites use it for scaffolding; when steel is insufficient, "bamboo reinforcement" can be used instead of "steel reinforcement"; vegetable farmers use it to build melon sheds; and it is also used as a raw material for papermaking. It is also a commodity that can be exported. Moso bamboo is currently a large commodity in short supply, originally managed uniformly by supply and marketing cooperatives. The Guangdong Provincial People's Committee's trial plan on market management lists it as a commodity that the state should control the vast majority of.

In early October, Qingyuan County, without seriously studying the scope, steps, methods, and market organizational leadership of opening up the free market, hastily listed moso bamboo as an open commodity. Afterward, moso bamboo became the center of price increases and competitive purchases everywhere. Bamboo joint ventures, construction purchasing departments, and bamboo handicraft cooperatives from Guangzhou, Foshan, Nanhai, and other places all sent people to the production areas to抢购(qiǎnggòu - frantically purchase), with market prices one to three times higher than listed prices. The purchase price was 1.6 yuan per dan (a unit of weight); the bamboo handicraft cooperatives in Foshan and Nanhai, regardless of the specifications of the moso bamboo, purchased it at a uniform price of 3.3 yuan per dan; the bamboo joint venture in Guangzhou raised the price to a maximum of more than 6 yuan per dan, and also used the method of paying "wages" (0.2 to 0.5 yuan per day) to hire farmers to cut bamboo in the mountains. Seeing the high price of bamboo, farmers took the opportunity to sell off and indiscriminately cut moso bamboo. In less than twenty days, Qingyuan County had more than 200,000 dan of moso bamboo搶购(qiǎnggòu - frantically purchased) by Guangzhou, Foshan, Nanhai, and other places. The verdant and lush bamboo forests have been cut down, turning into bare hillsides. After the incident, supply and marketing cooperative cadres had opinions, but because they did not clearly understand the specific policies of market opening, they did not dare to handle it and could not intervene in the purchase. Local farmers and some district and township cadres also questioned the supply and marketing cooperative cadres, saying, "If outsiders can offer high prices for purchase, why can't you offer the same prices?" and declared that they would no longer sell moso bamboo to the supply and marketing cooperative.

Now, the moso bamboo has been抢购(qiǎnggòu - frantically purchased) completely. What bad consequences has it brought? What lessons should we learn from this incident?

One result of the搶购(qiǎnggòu - frantically purchase): the principle of the state controlling the source of goods and rationally allocating them according to plan has been undermined. Departments in urgent need of moso bamboo have not been allocated the source of goods or have been allocated less, while a lot of moso bamboo has been used in less important places. This is harmful and unprofitable to production. At the same time, due to the high price of moso bamboo, the cost of bamboo products and engineering costs will inevitably increase, and it will also affect the prices of other commodities, causing certain chaotic phenomena in the market.

Another result of the搶购(qiǎnggòu - frantically purchase): the moso bamboo has been cut down, and the future source of moso bamboo will be greatly reduced. Moso bamboo is a perennial plant and should be cut in rotation year by year according to plan. Each moso bamboo must take at least two years to grow (the first year the bamboo body is tender, and it can only be used after the second year when the body is old). Obviously, the problem of the source of moso bamboo next year will be difficult to solve.

There is also a bad consequence of争购(zhēnggòu - competing to purchase) moso bamboo: the relationship between certain district and township cadres, farmers, and commercial departments has become disharmonious.

If you open the free market, do not clearly stipulate the scope of varieties, do not conduct in-depth policy publicity, and leave it alone, how can it succeed?

After the free market is opened, commodities such as moso bamboo, which should be controlled by the state, must not be included in the open range. Instead, under the leadership of the market management committee, the transactions of these commodities must be effectively managed. If purchasing units from other places need these commodities, they should go to the professional or comprehensive trading markets designated by the market management committee and purchase them at the local listed prices. The market management committee has the responsibility to appropriately allocate the source of goods according to market conditions. The policies and measures for opening up the market must be thoroughly publicized to cadres and the masses. Only when everyone clearly understands the policies and their thoughts are clear can the free market develop normally.

    何必如此匆忙
    广东清远县在没有认真研究开放自由市场的范围、步骤、组织领导之前，匆促地把应由国家掌握大部分的毛竹列为可以自由买卖的物资，造成了严重的恶果。
    胡迪棠
    广东省清远县七、八两区盛产毛竹。每年都有大量的毛竹运销到广州、佛山等地去。毛竹的用途很广：渔民捕鱼要用它；竹器手工业要用它作原料；建筑工地要用它搭棚；钢材不足的时候可用“竹筋”代替“钢筋”；菜农要用它搭瓜棚；造纸也用它做原料。它也是可以出口的物资。毛竹目前是供不应求的大宗商品，原由供销合作社统一经营。广东省人民委员会关于市场管理的试行方案中，把它列为国家应掌握绝大部分的商品。
    10月初，清远县在没有认真研究开放自由市场的范围、步骤、方法、市场组织领导等问题之前，匆促地把毛竹列为开放的物资。以后，毛竹就成为各地抬价争购的中心。广州、佛山、南海等地的竹业合营店、建筑采购部门、竹器手工业社等都派人到产地去抢购，市价比牌价高出一倍到三倍。收购牌价为每担一元六角；佛山、南海的竹器手工业社，却不问毛竹规格如何，一律以三元三角一担收购，广州的竹业合营店最高抬价到六元多一担，并且还用出“工钱”的办法（每天二角到五角）雇农民上山砍竹。农民见竹价高，都趁机抛售和乱砍毛竹。不到二十天，清远县即被广州、佛山、南海等地抢购去了二十多万担毛竹。苍绿茂盛的竹林，已被砍伐殆尽，变成光秃秃的山坡了。事情发生后，供销社干部虽有意见，但因没有明确了解市场开放的具体政策，不敢处理，也没法插手收购。当地农民和一些区乡干部，还质问供销社干部说：“外地能出高价收购，你们为什么不能出同等的价格呢？”声言以后不卖毛竹给供销社了。
    现在，毛竹已经抢完了。它带来什么恶果呢？我们从这件事中应吸取什么教训呢？
    抢购的结果之一：国家掌握货源、按计划合理分配的原则被破坏了。急需毛竹的部门分配不到货源或分得少了，而很多毛竹却被用到次要的地方去了。这对生产是有害而无利的。同时，由于毛竹价格高，也必然使竹器成本和工程造价提高，还会影响其他商品的价格，造成市场的某些混乱现象。
    抢购的又一结果：毛竹砍光了，今后的毛竹货源大大减少了。毛竹是多年生的植物，应该是按计划逐年轮番砍伐的。每棵毛竹起码要经过两年才能长成（第一年竹身嫩，第二年身老后才能用）。显然，明年的毛竹货源问题必将很难解决。
    争购毛竹还有一个恶果：某些区乡干部、农民和商业部门之间的关系不和谐了。
    开放了自由市场，不明确规定品种范围，不深入进行政策宣传，撒手不管，怎么能成？
    在自由市场开放以后，毛竹等应由国家掌握货源的商品，绝不能列入开放范围。而要在市场管理委员会的领导下，把这些商品的交易切实地管理起来。外地采购单位需要这些商品，应该到市场管理委员会指定的专业性或综合性的交易市场内，要按当地牌价收购。市场管理委员会，有责任根据市场情况适当分配货源，关于开放市场的政策和措施，必须向干部、群众作深入的宣传。只有大家对政策认清了，思想通畅了，自由市场才可能正常发展。
