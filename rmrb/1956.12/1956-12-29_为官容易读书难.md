    “It's Easy to be an Official, Hard to Study”
    Shao Yanxiang
    According to reports, there was a section chief who "instructed" his subordinates discussing the "Eighth National Congress" documents, urging everyone to study the "eight major documents" arranged by the higher authorities, and so on.

    After a moment of stunned laughter, I remembered a hanging scroll I had when I was a child, which said: "It's easy to be an official, hard to study." This came from the pen of a bureaucrat, and I thank him for inadvertently telling the truth. For him, "being an official" meant simply "being an official": riding on the backs of the people, plundering at will, capable of "raising the sky three feet"; if one had a patron to rely on, and power in hand, it was not a difficult thing at all.

    Doesn't the crosstalk "Promoted Three Levels in a Row" also talk about such a character? Zhang Haogu, an illiterate and ignorant fellow, actually muddled through three years in the Hanlin Academy, relying entirely on the phrase "good, good" to deal with various errands. Although this is a satire by crosstalk performers, in that society of buying and selling official positions, there was indeed no shortage of such people.

    Today, it's different. Regardless of one's position, one must serve the people. Serving the people is not easy; one must have real talent and practical knowledge. To serve well, one must study—broadly speaking, that is, learn. For example, one must study political economy, study the "Eighth National Congress" documents, and many policies of the Party and the state; one must also study professional knowledge. For example, if one is engaged in opera work, one should know that "Luanshi Yuanyang" and "Bai Yue Ji" are both plays, and not regard the former as a pornographic opera to be banned, and so on.

    Serving the people, being a servant of the people, is not really being an official at all. However, among these people, there are bureaucrats who do not serve the people well. Bureaucracy has its causes, and many causes at that, one of which is holding a leadership position without studying. Not reading, or reading without understanding, leads to ideological rigidity and spiritual emptiness. The result is not "easy to be an official," but rather "easy to become an official"—naturally becoming a bureaucrat. But our system opposes bureaucracy and does not protect it, which makes the situation of bureaucrats very "uneasy," "pressured from above and squeezed from below," extremely embarrassing.

    However, not every "person in this situation" is fully aware of this. A certain section chief is still only urging others to study the "eight major documents." Looking around, is it just that one section chief? Therefore, we must sound the alarm.

    Whether "it's easy to be an official" or not, let's leave that aside for now. "It's hard to study," that's a fact. If you don't want to dabble superficially, or just memorize dogma, then every lesson requires honest and earnest labor. If you don't want to become someone who "only holds office, but does nothing," and is eventually abandoned by the people, but want to do more and better things for the people, then you cannot be stingy with this labor.

    Let us remember this new anecdote about the "eight major documents" and constantly use it as a warning.

### “为官容易读书难”

    “为官容易读书难”
    邵燕祥
    报载，有这样一位科长，对他属下讨论“八大”文件的同志“训话”，要大家学好上级布置的“八个大文件”云云。
    哑然失笑之余，我想起小时候朝夕相对的一幅中堂，上面一句说：“为官容易读书难”。这出自一个官僚的手笔，感谢他无意间说出了老实话。在他，“为官”就是“为官”：骑在人民头上，信手搜刮，可使“天高三尺”；倘有靠山可凭，大权在握，本不是什么难事。
    单口相声“连升三级”不是也讲到这么一个角色么？目不识丁、不学无术的张好古，居然在翰林院里混了三年，全仗着一句“好的好的”，应付了许多差使。这虽然是相声艺人的讽谕，其实在那买官鬻爵的社会，确是不乏其人。
    今天可不然了。不管在什么职位，都要为人民服务。为人民服务不容易，得有真才实学；要服务得好，得读书——广义地说，就是学习。例如要学习政治经济学，学习“八大”文件，以及党和国家的许多政策；还要学习专业知识，比方从事戏曲工作吧，就该知道“乱世鸳鸯”和“拜月记”是一出戏，不把前者当作黄色戏曲禁演等等。
    为人民服务，做人民的勤务员，本来无所谓官；不过在这当中，为人民服务得不好的官僚主义者是有的。官僚主义事出有因，而且原因很多，其中之一就是身居领导职位而不学习。不读书，或读书不求甚解，思想僵化，精神空虚，结果不是“为官容易”，倒是“容易为官”——很自然地成为官僚主义者。但是我们的制度是反对官僚主义而不是保护官僚主义的，这就使官僚主义者处境很不“容易”，“上压下挤”，十分难堪。
    无如并不是每一个“此中人”全部意识到了这一点。某科长就还只是在督促别人学习“八个大文件”呢。放眼看来，又何独某科长然！所以非敲起警钟不可。
    “为官容易”与否，姑且不去管它；“读书难”，这是事实。若不想浅尝辄止，或仅仅背诵教条，那么每一课都要付出老老实实的劳动。若不想成为“只做官、不做事”，终于被人民摈弃的人，而想为人民多做事、做好事，就不能吝惜这份劳动。
    让我们记住“八个大文件”这个新典故，经常引以为戒吧。
