    "Dismounting"
    Wu Lü
    Waste caused by poor planning is the greatest waste, and savings caused by realistic planning are the greatest savings. Currently, in capital construction, opposing waste and practicing thrift, the most important thing is to rearrange plans. Some units' original capital construction plans, due to a lack of practical understanding of needs and possibilities, requested too much investment from the state. Now, it is necessary to cut down this portion of improperly arranged investment. For example, those that could have been built at a slower pace but were decided on too quickly should have their speed slowed down; those that could have been not built or built on a smaller scale but were decided on too large should be decided not to be built or have their scale reduced. These are usually called "dismounting."
    However, there are all kinds of ideas and practices for reducing investment.
    One type of person thinks: only with money can there be construction, and construction always costs money; since this is the case, we can only "act according to the money available." They have no objection to reducing investment, anyway, do as much as you can with what you have. "Do a little with a little money." This idea, of course, cannot be said to be entirely wrong. How can construction proceed without money? However, although construction costs money, there is much to be said about how much is spent. "One penny does one penny's worth of work" is one way of spending; "two pennies do one penny's worth of work" is also a way of spending; "one penny does two pennies' worth of work" is yet another way of spending. Comparing the three, "one penny does one penny's worth of work" is better than "two pennies do one penny's worth of work," but it is inferior to "one penny does two pennies' worth of work." Allowing for reduced investment, holding the idea of "one penny does one penny's worth of work," "do a little with a little money," although it can reduce investment and save some money, it comes at the cost of doing less. If what is being done less is something that can be done less or delayed, that is correct; if what is being done less is something that is indispensable and cannot be delayed, then it is bad. From a broader perspective, it can affect the proportional development of various sectors of the national economy; from a narrower perspective, it can create imbalances in various links within an enterprise. This, like dismounting, if done poorly and you fall and injure yourself, it can easily become a limp.
    The best is "one penny does two pennies' worth of work," that is, spending less money to do more work. This is the most proactive idea. Holding this idea, not only can things that can be stopped or delayed be stopped or delayed, but also things that are indispensable and cannot be delayed can be done with the greatest effort to save. If you ask: is this idea realistic? Please see the news published in today's newspaper about the Tianjin Tractor Factory and the Qingdao Kiln Stone General Factory reducing investment. One is reducing next year's investment by two-thirds compared to the original plan, and it is expected that tractors can still be produced according to the original schedule; the other is reducing next year's investment by 30,000 yuan, and the production of bricks and tiles can still increase by nearly 10 million pieces.
    Where is the secret? It lies in the fact that these two units, in dealing with reduced investment, do not passively hold the idea of "do a little with a little money," but actively try to spend less money to do more work. With this proactive understanding, the road to spending less money and doing more work is very broad.
    "Dismounting" in this way is relatively stable.

    “下马”
    吴滤
    计划不周所造成的浪费是最大的浪费，计划切合实际所造成的节约是最大的节约。目前，在基本建设中反对浪费，厉行节约，最主要的是重新安排计划。有些单位原订的基本建设计划，由于没有切实了解需要和可能，因而向国家要的投资多了些。现在需要把这部分安排得不妥当的投资削下来。例如本来可以缓建而定得过快了的，把速度放慢些；本来可以不建或少建而定得过大了的，就决定不建或把规模摆小些。这些，通常都称为“下马”。
    但是，削减投资有各式各样的想法和做法。
    有一种人的想法是：有钱才能建设，建设总要花钱；既如此，就只能“见钱行事”。让削减投资，他们没有意见，反正有多少钱，办多少事。“钱少少办事”呗。这种想法，当然不能说一概都是错的。建设，没有钱怎么行呢？但是，建设虽然要花钱，花多花少却大有文章。“一分钱办一分事”是一种花法；“两分钱办一分事”也是一种花法；“一分钱办两分事”又是一种花法。三者比较，“一分钱办一分事”比起“两分钱办一分事”来虽是上乘，比起“一分钱办两分事”来却又见拙了。让削减投资，抱着“一分钱办一分事”、“钱少少办事”的想法，虽然也能把投资削下来，节省一笔钱，但是以少办事作代价的。若是少办了的，是可少之事，可缓之事，那是对的；若是少办了的，是不可少之事，不可缓之事，那就坏了。从大处讲，可以影响国民经济各个部门按比例地发展，从小处讲，可以造成企业内部各个环节的不平衡。这，也同下马一样，下得不好，摔伤了，是很容易变成跛脚的。
    最好的是“一分钱办两分事”，即少花钱多办事。这是一种最积极的想法。持这种想法，不但可少之事、可缓之事得以停办、缓办，不可少之事、不可缓之事，也能办得力求节省。若问：这种想法是否现实？请看今天本报发表的天津拖拉机制造厂和青岛窑石总厂削减投资的新闻。一个是明年的投资比原计划削减三分之二，预计还可以按原定的进度生产拖拉机，一个是明年的投资削减三万元，砖瓦的产量还可以增加近一千万块。
    秘诀在那里？就在于这两个单位对待削减投资，不是消极地存着“钱少少办事”的想法，而是积极地设法少花钱多办事。有了这种积极的认识，少花钱多办事的道路倒是广阔得很的。
    这样“下马”，才是比较稳当的。
