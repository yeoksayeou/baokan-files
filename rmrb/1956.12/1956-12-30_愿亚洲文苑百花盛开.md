    May the Asian Literary Garden Blossom with a Hundred Flowers

    The Asian Writers' Conference held in New Delhi, India, has concluded.

    This is a conference of historical significance. For the first time, writers' representatives from Asian countries gathered together to introduce the current state of literature in their respective countries, exchange experiences in literary work, and discuss major issues related to the development of new Asian literature in an atmosphere of friendship and cooperation. The remarkable achievements of this conference will inevitably have a positive impact on the Asian literary world and provide great encouragement to literary workers in various countries.

    Carrying forward the Asian literary tradition is an important topic of this conference. Asian writers have a particularly deep feeling about the importance of this issue. Asia has a brilliant ancient culture, a rich treasure of classical literature, and a profound literary and artistic tradition. Asia's literary heritage has always radiated dazzling light in the world's literary treasury. However, under the long-term rule of Western colonialism, the people lost their freedom of life and cultural activities; the literary traditions of Asian countries were severely damaged, the wealth of folk art was widely neglected, and the development of new literature encountered great obstacles. Today, a new page has been turned in Asian history. The glorious task of Asian writers is to gradually build a temple of new literature on the basis of carrying forward the literary traditions of their respective nations. Their efforts have already achieved outstanding results. Many excellent literary works truthfully reflect the lives and struggles of the people, reflect the people's good wishes, and educate the broad masses of readers. However, facing the people's increasing demands on literary works and looking forward to the long-term goals of new literary construction, writers feel more and more deeply the importance of their responsibilities and the importance of carrying forward the literary tradition. This conference concentratedly reflects their common feeling.

    The reason why it is important to carry forward the national literary tradition is that it is a necessary condition for building new literature. Literature reflects life. Every nation has its own characteristic content of life and way of life, and the literature of every nation has its own aesthetic characteristics that reflect life. Literature that is divorced from the national tradition is like water without a source and a tree without roots. It is impossible to have abundant vitality and a promising future. The deeper the national soil of the literary garden, the more distinctive the national color of literary flowers, the more it will win the attention and love of readers around the world, and the more it will become a shared artistic wealth of mankind.

    The conference emphasized the importance of cultural ties and cultural exchanges between countries. Our ancestors had already set a brilliant example for us in this regard. The mutual influence of classical literature in Asian countries has not only not diminished the characteristics of various nations, but has also continuously enriched and developed the literary traditions of various countries. This is a distinct phenomenon in the history of Asian literary development. Today, the exchange of literature between Asian countries with a long history of relations is of even greater practical significance. It not only helps the development of literary undertakings in various countries, but also enhances mutual understanding among the people of various countries. We have already done a lot of work in this area, and we will do more in the future. The mutual translation of works from Asian countries should be strengthened, the mutual study of literature from various countries should be strengthened, and the connections between writers from various countries should be expanded and deepened. This is the primary step in promoting cultural exchanges between countries around the world.

    This conference also prominently reflected the extreme importance that Asian writers attach to peace and freedom. They believe that peace and freedom are the prerequisites for the prosperity of literary undertakings. War means the destruction of culture. Only on peaceful land, in an atmosphere of free competition, can brilliant artistic flowers bloom. The hundreds of millions of people in Asia have achieved great victories in the long and arduous struggle against colonialism, destroyed various man-made obstacles, created a new environment of peace and freedom for the development of literature and art, and provided new favorable conditions for friendly cooperation among writers from various countries.

    Differences in political views, literary and artistic ideas, literary and artistic schools, and creative methods do not hinder the sincere unity of writers under the common goal of defending peace and promoting creation. The great success of this conference is a vivid proof. In order to promote the great unity of writers around the world and the high prosperity of human literature and art, may writers from Asian countries engage in free competition in literary and artistic creation on the basis of mutual assistance and cooperation, and may the Asian literary garden blossom with a hundred flowers and be like spring all year round.

    愿亚洲文苑百花盛开
    在印度新德里举行的亚洲作家会议闭幕了。
    这是有历史意义的会议。亚洲各国作家代表第一次聚首一堂，在友好合作的气氛中介绍了各国的文学现状，交流了各国的文学工作经验，讨论了有关发展亚洲新文学的各项重大问题。这个会议所取得的显著收获，必然要在亚洲文学界产生积极影响，给各国文学工作者以巨大鼓舞。
    发扬光大亚洲文学传统问题是这次会议的重要议题。亚洲作家对这个问题的重要性有特别深切的感觉。亚洲有灿烂的古文化，有丰富的古典文学宝藏，有深厚的文学艺术传统。亚洲的文学遗产一直在世界文学宝库里放射着夺目的光芒。可是在西方殖民主义者的长期统治之下，人民失去了生活的自由和文化活动的自由；亚洲各国的文学传统受到了严重的破坏，民间艺术财富受到普遍的漠视，新文学的发展碰到极大的阻碍。今天，亚洲历史展开了新的一页，亚洲作家的光荣任务就是要在发扬各自民族的文学传统的基础上逐步建立新文学的殿堂。他们的努力已经有了出色的成就，许多优秀文学作品真实地反映了人民的生活和斗争，反映了人民的美好愿望，给广大读者以教育。可是面对着人民对文学作品的日益提高的要求，瞻望新文学建设的远大目标，作家们一天比一天深切地感觉到自己责任的重大，感觉到发扬光大文学传统的重要。这次会议集中地反映了他们的这种共同感觉。
    发扬民族的文学传统之所以重要，就是因为这是建设新文学的必要条件。文学是反映生活的。每个民族都有自己的富有特征的生活内容和生活方式，每个民族的文学都有自己的反映生活的美学特色。脱离民族传统的文学，正如无源之水，无根之木，不可能有充沛的活力和远大的发展前途。文学园地的民族土壤越深厚，文学花朵的民族色彩越鲜明，就越能博得世界读者的重视和爱好，越能成为人类共享的艺术财富。
    会议强调各国文化联系、文化交流的重要。我们的祖先早在这方面为我们树立了光辉的榜样。亚洲各国古典文学的相互影响，非但没有减损各个民族的特色，而且不断地丰富和发展了各国的文学传统。这是亚洲文学发展史上的鲜明现象。在今天，有悠久历史关系的亚洲各国文学的交流，更有重大的实际意义。它不但有助于各国文学事业的发展，而且能增进各国人民的相互了解。我们在这方面已经做了不少工作，今后还要做更多的工作。亚洲各国作品的相互翻译工作应该加强，各国文学的相互研究工作应该加强，各国作家的联系应该扩大和加深。这是促进世界各国文化交流的首要步骤。
    这次会议也突出地反映了亚洲作家对和平和自由的极端重视。他们认为和平和自由是繁荣文学事业的先决条件。战争意味着文化的毁灭。只有在和平的土地上，在自由竞赛的气氛中，才能开放出烂漫的艺术之花。亚洲亿万人民在长期艰苦斗争中取得了反殖民主义的伟大胜利，摧毁了各种人为的障碍，为文学艺术的发展创造了和平自由的新环境，为各国作家的友好合作提供了新的有利条件。
    政治见解、文艺思想、文艺流派和创作方法的不同，无碍于作家们在保卫和平、繁荣创作的共同目标下的精诚团结。这次会议的巨大成功就是一个生动的证明。为了促进世界作家的大团结和人类文学艺术的高度繁荣，愿亚洲各国作家在互助合作的基础上展开文艺创作的自由竞赛，愿亚洲的文苑里百花盛开，四季如春。
