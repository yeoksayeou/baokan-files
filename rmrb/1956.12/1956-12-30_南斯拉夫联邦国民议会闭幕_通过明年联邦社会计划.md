Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 29th - According to the Yugoslav News Agency, the session of the Yugoslav Federal National Assembly closed in Belgrade on the evening of the 27th. After discussion, the meeting finally approved the 1957 Federal Social Plan and Budget, as well as a bill and other economic resolutions.

The 1957 Yugoslav Federal Social Plan, passed by the National Assembly, stipulates that the aim of next year's economic policy is to further develop and stabilize the economy, to enable the economic system and the worker management system to play a more powerful role, and to systematically and more rapidly increase labor productivity; one of the main tasks of economic policy is to increase personal consumption and raise the living standards of the masses, especially the workers.

The plan stipulates that the total social output of the Federation next year will increase by 10.4% compared with this year, of which industrial production will increase by 13% and agricultural production by 12%; relying on the growth of industrial and agricultural production and the increase in imports of consumer goods, the total volume of consumer goods will increase by 11% compared with this year.

According to the Federal Social Plan, Yugoslavia's total investment in 1957 (including investment in the military industry) will be 421 billion dinars (the name of the Yugoslav currency). In order to achieve the above-mentioned economic policy goals and main tasks, and to accelerate the development of those economic sectors that hinder the further development of the national economy due to backwardness, the proportion of investment will be greatly changed. The proportion of investment in social and cultural facilities in the total investment will increase to 20%, and the investment amount will increase by 14.5 billion dinars compared with this year. In the economic investment, which accounts for 80% of the total investment, the proportion of investment in agriculture, transportation and construction industry will increase to 8.8%, 20.3% and 4% respectively. The proportion of investment in industry and mining, which accounts for 38% of the total economic investment, will also be changed in order to greatly increase the output of consumer goods. The plan stipulates that next year's investment in industry and mining will be reduced by more than 10 billion dinars, to 160 billion dinars; part of this investment will be used to establish the electric power industry, and another part will be used to renovate and complete those industrial and mining enterprises that have already started construction.

Due to the increase in industrial and agricultural production and the increase in imports of consumer goods, the personal consumption of the federal people in 1957 will be able to increase by 9% compared with this year, and the wages of workers will increase by 7% to 12%.

The plan also stipulates that next year Yugoslavia's exports will be 109.3 billion dinars, an increase of 13.8% compared with this year, but the export of certain goods, especially agricultural products needed to strengthen the supply of the domestic market, will be restricted.

At the closing meeting on the 27th, the Yugoslav Federal Secretary of State for National Defense, Gošnjak, spoke on the issue of Yugoslavia's military expenditure for next year. He announced to the meeting that in 1957, the expenditure of the federal army will remain at this year's level, accounting for 9.99% of the national income. When planning military expenditure, Yugoslavia will no longer rely on foreign military assistance.

    南斯拉夫联邦国民议会闭幕
    通过明年联邦社会计划
    据新华社29日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫联邦国民议会会议27日晚上在贝尔格莱德闭幕。经过讨论后，会议最后通过了1957年的联邦社会计划和预算，以及一项法案和其他一些经济方面的决议。
    为国民议会会议通过的1957年南斯拉夫联邦社会计划规定：明年的经济政策的目的在于进一步发展和稳定经济，在于使经济制度和工人管理制度更加有力地发挥作用和有系统地、更加迅速地提高劳动生产率；经济政策的主要的任务之一是增加个人消费量和提高人民群众特别是职工的生活水平。
    计划规定，明年联邦的社会总生产量将比今年增加10.4％，其中，工业生产增加13％，农业生产增加12％；依靠工农业生产的增长和消费品进口的增加，将使消费品总量比今年增加11％。
    根据联邦社会计划，南斯拉夫在1957年的投资总额（包括军事工业的投资在内）将为四千二百十亿第纳尔（南币名）。为了完成上述经济政策的目的和主要任务，为了加速发展那些由于落后而妨碍了国家经济的进一步发展的经济部门，投资的比例将作巨大的改变。社会文化设施方面的投资在投资总额中所占的比重将提高到20％，投资额比今年增加一百四十五亿第纳尔。在占总投资的80％的经济投资中，农业、运输业和建筑工业的投资所占的比例将分别增加到8.8％、20.3％和4％。占经济投资总额38％的工矿业投资的比例也将有改变，以便大大增加消费品的产量。计划规定，明年的工矿业投资将减少一百多亿第纳尔，成为一千六百亿第纳尔；这方面的投资一部分将用来建立电力工业，另一部分将用来改建和完成早先已经开始建设的那些工矿业企业。
    由于工农业生产增加和消费品进口的增加，1957年联邦人民的个人消费量将能够比今年增加9％，职工的工资将增加7％到12％。
    计划还规定，明年南斯拉夫出口额将为一千零九十三亿第纳尔，比今年增加13.8％，但是某些货品特别是为加强国内市场的供应所需要的农产品的出口，将要受到限制。
    在27日的闭幕会议上，南斯拉夫联邦国防国务秘书长戈什尼亚克就南斯拉夫明年的军事开支问题发言。他向会议宣布，1957年，联邦军队的开支将保持今年的水平，占国民收入的9.99％。在计划军队开支的时候，南斯拉夫将不再依靠外国的军事援助。
