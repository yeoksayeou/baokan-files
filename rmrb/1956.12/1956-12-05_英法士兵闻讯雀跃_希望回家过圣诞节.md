　　British and French Soldiers Cheer Upon Hearing the News
　  Hoping to Go Home for Christmas
    Xinhua News Agency, December 4th -- According to an Associated Press reporter from Port Said, British and French soldiers in the Port Said area cheered, patted each other on the shoulders, and shouted "Going home for Christmas!" on December 3rd upon hearing the announcement by the British and French governments that they would withdraw their troops from Egypt.
    The reporter said that hundreds of soldiers gathered around radios, listening to the news that British and French troops would withdraw within two or three weeks. The news spread like wildfire among the thousands of soldiers at the outposts and around the foxholes stretching from Port Said to Kap, twenty-seven miles down the Suez Canal.
    When the radio broadcast the British Foreign Secretary's statement on the withdrawal issue at 7:00 PM local time, the soldiers who were having dinner lost their appetite, and most of the dinner was left uneaten that night.
    The report said that Major General Geoffrey Hobb, Chief of Staff of the British and French Allied Forces Headquarters stationed in Cyprus, arrived in Port Said to confer with Lieutenant General Hugh Stockwell, commander of the British and French Allied Forces Task Force.
    Shortly after 8:00 PM local time, Stockwell issued a statement on the withdrawal issue, saying, "Since the current goal is to withdraw within two or three weeks, I will formulate shipboard plans accordingly."

　　英法士兵闻讯雀跃
　  希望回家过圣诞节
    新华社4日讯　据美联社记者从塞得港报道，塞得港地区的英法军队士兵12月3日在听到英法两国政府宣布要从埃及撤军的消息时，都高兴得互相拍肩膀、欢呼，高喊着“回家过圣诞节”。
    这个记者说，成百的士兵聚集在收音机周围，收听英法军队将在两三星期内撤退的消息。这则消息像一阵风一样在哨岗上和从塞得港到苏伊士运河下游二十七英里的卡普一带的散兵坑周围的成千名士兵中间传开了。
    当无线电在当地时间下午七点播送英国外交大臣关于撤军问题的声明时，正在吃晚饭的士兵们已经无心吃饭，这天晚上的晚饭大多数都剩下来了。
    报道说，驻在塞浦路斯的英法联军总司令部参谋长乔弗雷·霍布斯少将到塞得港同英法联军特遣部队司令休·司托克威尔中将进行了商谈。
    司托克威尔在当地时间下午八点以后不久就撤军问题发表谈话说：“既然现在的目标是要在两三星期内撤退，我将相应地制定乘船计划。”
