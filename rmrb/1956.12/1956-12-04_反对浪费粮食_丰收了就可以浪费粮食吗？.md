　　Oppose Waste of Grain
　　Can Grain Be Wasted After a Good Harvest?
    Many agricultural production cooperatives in Hubei Province do not pay attention to cherishing grain after a good harvest, and there are serious waste phenomena in the process of harvesting, storing, and eating grain.
    Some cadres and members of agricultural production cooperatives that have had good harvests believe that since the harvest is good and there is a lot of grain, a little loss and more use is a "minor matter." Under the control of this idea, many areas do not pay attention to careful harvesting when harvesting grain, but instead scatter it "half in the sky, half on the ground"; they are not careful and cautious in storing grain, which leads to theft by bad people and trampling by rats and birds; they do not pay attention to saving in the use of grain, and use a large amount of staple grain to make sugar and brew wine, and even feed chickens and ducks. According to the Ying Shan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, agricultural production cooperatives throughout the county have varying degrees of loss and waste of grain. The rice threshing of the Beidou Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dabangdian Township was very unclean, and the entire cooperative lost 160,000 jin of rice. The Third Team of the Fourth Agricultural Production Cooperative in Luodian Township, Ying Shan, believed that everything would be fine after the grain was stored in the warehouse, and no one was sent to guard the warehouse, and 7,000 jin of rice were stolen by bad people at one time. The agricultural production cooperatives in Santaihe Township, Huanggang County, did not conduct education on cherishing grain and collectivism to the members during the harvesting and distribution of grain, so some members did not regard the grain in the cooperative as their own, and therefore suffered a lot of damage. According to statistics, the 20 agricultural production cooperatives in the township scattered 4,300 jin of rice, trampled 11,000 jin of rice by livestock, and stole 3,860 jin of rice by bad people. In addition, there are also many scattered peanuts, cotton, sweet potatoes, sesame seeds, etc. The Santaihe Township Party Branch of the Chinese Communist Party calculated based on these circumstances that the more than 50,000 jin of grain lost and wasted in the township would be enough for more than 100 people to eat for a year.
    This phenomenon of massive trampling and waste of grain is worthy of attention, and it is hoped that the local leading departments will take measures to stop it.　　Niè Bīn

### 反对浪费粮食　丰收了就可以浪费粮食吗？

　　反对浪费粮食
　　丰收了就可以浪费粮食吗？
    湖北省很多农业生产合作社在丰收后很不注意爱惜粮食，在收获、保藏和食用过程中，都有严重的浪费现象。
    有些丰收了的农业生产合作社的干部和社员认为：丰收了，粮食很多，损耗和多用一点是“小意思”。在这种思想支配下，很多地区在收获粮食的时候不注意细收细打，而是“天一半，地一半”的抛撒；在保藏粮食上不细心谨慎，被坏人偷盗，让老鼠、雀鸟糟踏；在使用粮食上不注意节约，用大量的主粮熬糖烧酒，甚至喂养鸡、鸭。据中共应山县委会反映，全县农业生产合作社都有不同程度的损耗和浪费粮食的现象。大邦店乡北斗农业生产合作社的稻谷脱粒很不干净，全社损失稻谷十六万斤。应山洛店乡第四农业生产合作社第三队，认为粮食归仓就万事大吉，不派人看守仓库，一次被坏人偷去稻谷七千斤。黄冈县三台河乡的农业生产合作社，由于在收获、分配粮食的时候没有向社员进行爱惜粮食和集体主义教育，有些社员们不把社里的粮食当成自己的东西，因此糟损很多。据统计，全乡二十个农业生产合作社抛撒的稻谷有四千三百斤，被牲畜糟踏的稻谷有一万一千多斤，被坏人偷窃的稻谷有三千八百六十斤。此外抛撒的花生、棉花、红苕、芝麻等也不少。中共三台河乡党支部根据这些情况计算了一下，全乡损耗、浪费的五万多斤粮食，约够一百多人食用一年。
    这种大量糟踏、浪费粮食的现象是值得注意的，希望当地领导部门采取措施加以制止。　　聂彬
