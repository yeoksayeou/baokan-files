Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 15th: The "Rodong Sinmun" of Korea reported today on the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party held from December 11th to 13th. The meeting discussed the people's economic plan for 1957, the first year of Korea's first Five-Year Plan, and other issues.

The meeting discussed the economic plan for 1957. The meeting pointed out that this year's total industrial output value may exceed the target set in the Three-Year Plan by about 23%. In agriculture, this year's grain output has reached the level of 1949, and people's lives have improved. The meeting also pointed out that in the past period, shortcomings and errors had occurred in the guidance work of formulating and implementing the people's economic plan.

The meeting, based on the basic direction pointed out by the Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party, stipulated the basic tasks of the 1957 economic plan. This is to rapidly restore and develop heavy industry, especially industries such as metal, coal, chemical, machinery, and electricity. At the same time, various methods should be used to expand the production of daily necessities, consumer goods, and food to improve people's lives. In terms of capital construction, investment should be focused and concentrated to prevent dispersion. The agricultural sector should increase yield per unit area, increase grain output, and expand the planting area of various cash crops and oil crops.

The meeting emphasized that when the Three-Year Plan is successfully completed and the first Five-Year Plan is implemented, strict streamlining and frugality should be carried out, and waste should be opposed. The meeting also emphasized the need to further consolidate the ideological unity and consistency of action within the Party; strengthen the struggle against bureaucracy, oppose relaxation and complacency, and educate Party members and working people with the idea of ​​practicing thrift and overcoming difficulties.

The meeting also discussed the experience and lessons of the agricultural production reduction in North Hamgyong Province this year.

Comrade Kim Il-sung spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that the international reactionary forces have recently been frantically attempting to damage the prestige of the Soviet Union and intensify the international situation. At the same time, the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are creating war conspiracies in South Korea and carrying out various activities aimed at weakening our ranks. Kim Il-sung said that in this situation, we must strengthen unity and solidarity more than ever, maintain revolutionary vigilance at all times, and in particular, further strengthen friendship and solidarity with the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

When talking about the achievements of the Three-Year Plan and the plan for 1957, Kim Il-sung said that our achievements are great, but we should not be arrogant and complacent. Our motherland has not yet been unified, the economic foundation is not yet solid, and people's lives are not affluent. Therefore, we must work harder under the slogan of increasing production and practicing economy in order to successfully implement the first Five-Year Plan.

    讨论明年经济计划问题
    新华社平壤15日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”今天报道了朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在12月11日到13日举行的全体会议的情况。这次会议讨论了朝鲜第一个五年计划的第一年——1957年的人民经济计划和其他问题。
    会议就1957年经济计划问题进行了讨论。会议指出，今年的工业总产值可超过三年计划中所规定的指标23％左右。在农业方面，今年的谷物产量达到了1949年的水平，人民生活有了改善。会议同时指出，在过去期间，在人民经济计划的制定和执行中的指导工作上发生过缺点和错误。
    会议根据朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会所指出的基本方向，规定了1957年经济计划的基本任务。这就是迅速恢复发展重工业，特别是金属、煤炭、化学、机械、电力等工业部门。同时，用各种办法扩大日用必需品、消费品和食品等商品的生产，以改善人民生活。在基本建设方面要有重点地集中投资，防止分散。农业部门要提高单位面积产量，增加谷物产量，并且要扩大各种经济作物和油料作物的种植面积。
    会议强调指出，在三年计划胜利完成过渡到实行第一个五年计划的时候，要严格进行精简节约，反对浪费。会议并且强调要进一步巩固党内思想的统一和行动的一致；加强反对官僚主义的斗争，反对松懈和安逸，以厉行节约和克服困难的思想教育党员和劳动人民。
    会议还讨论了咸镜北道今年农业减产的经验教训。
    金日成同志在会上发了言。他强调说，最近国际反动势力疯狂地企图损害苏联的威信，加剧国际紧张局势。同时，美国和李承晚集团在南朝鲜制造战争阴谋，进行各种企图削弱我们的队伍的活动。金日成说，在这种情势下，我们比任何时候都要加强统一和团结，经常保持革命警惕性，特别是要进一步加强同以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的友谊团结。
    在谈到三年计划的成就和1957年的计划的时候，金日成说，我们取得的成就是大的，但是不要骄傲自满，我们的祖国还没有统一，经济基础还不巩固，人民生活也不富裕。所以我们要在增产节约的口号下更加紧张的工作，以期胜利地实行第一个五年计划。
