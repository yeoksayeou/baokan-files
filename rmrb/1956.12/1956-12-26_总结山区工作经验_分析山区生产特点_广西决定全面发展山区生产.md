Xinhua News Agency, Nanning Electric Dispatch The Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held its second mountain area production conference from December 11th to 17th. The conference summarized the experiences and lessons learned from mountain area work, analyzed the characteristics of mountain area production, and proposed a policy of comprehensively developing production.

The conference absorbed past experiences and lessons, pointing out the diversity, complexity, and significant commercial nature of mountain area production, making it impossible for relevant leading departments to make unified demands and mechanical regulations in guiding mountain area production. The conference demanded that relevant leading departments respect the planting habits of ethnic minorities in mountain areas, summarize the planting experience of local farmers, give play to the independent thinking ability of ethnic minority cadres, maintain the independence of production and operation of ethnic minority agricultural cooperatives, and gradually and effectively transform some inappropriate and backward farming techniques. The conference also required all localities to proceed from different situations, conduct in-depth investigations and research, rank production categories from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and make plans at each level. In areas where forestry production accounts for a large proportion, forestry should be placed in the primary position; in areas with many cash crops, cash crop production can also be placed in the first place; and in places where conditions permit striving for grain self-sufficiency, efforts should be made to achieve grain self-sufficiency. Stone mountain areas with poor conditions can strive for mostly or partially self-sufficiency, and mountain areas that are already self-sufficient in grain do not necessarily need to emphasize developing grain production.

    总结山区工作经验　分析山区生产特点
    广西决定全面发展山区生产
    据新华社南宁电　中共广西省委员会在12月11日到17日举行了第二次山区生产会议。会议总结了山区工作的经验教训，分析了山区生产的特点，提出了全面发展生产的方针。
    会议吸取了过去的经验教训，指出了山区生产的多样性、复杂性和很大商品性的特色，有关领导部门在指导山区生产上，就不可能作出统一的要求和机械的规定。会议要求有关领导部门尊重山区少数民族的种植习惯，总结当地农民的种植经验，发挥民族干部的独立思考能力，保持少数民族农业社生产经营的独立性，逐步而有效地对一些不适当的、落后的耕作技术加以改造。会议还要求各地从不同情况出发，深入调查研究，由上而下和由下而上地进行生产门类排队，逐级作出规划。林业生产比重大的地区，就把林业排在首要地位，经济作物多的地区，也可以把经济作物生产放在第一位，有条件争取粮食自给的地方，应力争粮食自给。条件差的石山区可以争取大部或一部自给，粮食已经自给的山区，就不一定再强调发展粮食生产。
