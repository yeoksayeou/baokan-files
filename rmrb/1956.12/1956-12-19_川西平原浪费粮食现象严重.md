Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 15th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Quanyu reports that in the Western Sichuan Plain region, which reaped a bumper harvest this year, the phenomenon of wasting grain is quite serious due to the "hands-off" approach adopted by many grain cadres in selling grain. Currently, this phenomenon has not been effectively corrected.

The biggest loophole is in the catering industry. Since the autumn harvest in August, cadres generally believe that saving grain is no longer important. The tax departments, in order to increase tax revenue, the private merchant transformation office, in order to take care of private merchants, and the supply and marketing cooperatives, in order to obtain more profits, all encouraged the catering industry and cooperative canteens to expand their grain requisition plans without principle. In some places, these departments even overstepped their authority and approved the catering industry to buy more grain. The grain departments, which are truly responsible for the approval work, abandoned their responsibilities and became mere figureheads. According to statistics, in the third quarter, the catering industry in seventeen counties of the Western Sichuan Plain used about 28% more grain than the original supply plan, an increase of 47% compared with the same period last year. The actual supply in October and November increased even more. Zhu Ziquan, the owner of a small restaurant in Xinjin County, reported that he used 800 jin of grain for the whole month, which was already 300 jin more than in the past, but the tax bureau cadre insisted that he report 1,400 jin. Many catering businesses could not use up the supplied grain, so it rotted in the store. The phenomenon of making grain into steamed buns, pancakes, noodles, and sweet dumplings and sending people to the countryside to sell them is also quite common. The Shou'an Township Cooperative Canteen in Wenjiang County has sold 28,000 steamed buns and 4,000 jin of noodles in various villages in the past 50 days alone.

Amidst the victory of the bumper harvest and the unified purchase and sale of grain, the grain bureaus of various counties all announced "withdrawal of troops," withdrawing cadres from many grain management stations and replacing them with temporary employees. These people are not familiar with the policies and mostly only care about selling grain, regardless of plans and procedures, and accepting all comers. In Wangjia District of Chongqing County, many residents bought their December grain in October, and the people at the grain management station were still unaware. At the Yuantong Township Grain Management Station, a group of passing boatmen bought 159 jin of rice without submitting grain coupons or going through any procedures.

After the grain department's "hands-off" approach, all grain requirements from government offices and schools were approved. The grain purchase budget and final accounts approval system became a mere formality, and the phenomenon of illegally purchasing grain became widespread. Cadres in government offices were given as many grain coupons as they needed for business trips. Many cadres could not use up the grain coupons in their hands and gave them to relatives and friends. Schools, which have no floating population, also received a large amount of flexible grain and grain coupons. Two middle schools in Chongqing County had accumulated grain coupons in October that could be used to purchase 9,624 jin of grain.

Due to the relaxation of management of grain supply work, the amount of grain sold in the Western Sichuan Plain region has surged in recent months.

### 川西平原浪费粮食现象严重

    川西平原浪费粮食现象严重
    新华社成都15日电　新华社记者喻权域报道，今年获得粮食丰收的川西平原地区，由于许多粮食干部采取“大放手”的办法销售粮食，浪费粮食的现象相当严重，目前，这种现象还没有得到很好的纠正。
    漏洞最大的是饮食行业。8月秋收以来，干部们普遍认为节约粮食不重要了，税务部门为了增加税收，私商改造办公室为了照顾私商，供销合作社为了多得利润，都无原则的鼓励饮食行业和合作食堂扩大要粮计划。有的地方，这些部门还擅自越权批准饮食行业多买粮食。真正负责审批工作的粮食部门放弃自己职权，形同虚设。据统计，三季度川西平原十七个县的饮食业用粮超过原订供应计划28％左右，比去年同期上升47％。10月和11月的实际供应数量增加更大。新津县小饮食店主朱子全自报全月用粮八百斤，已比过去多报三百斤，税务局干部硬叫他报一千四百斤。很多饮食行业用不完供应的粮食，便放在店里霉掉。把粮食制成馒头、饼子、切面和汤元等派人送到农村推销的现象，也相当普遍。温江寿安乡合作食堂仅最近五十天内，就在各村推销了二万八千个馒头，四千斤切面。
    在丰收和粮食统购统销胜利声中，各县粮食局都宣告“撤兵”，把许多粮食管理站的干部抽回，而代之以临时雇用人员。这些人员不熟悉政策，大都只顾埋头卖粮，不问计划和手续，来者不拒。崇庆县王家区好些居民10月间就把12月份的粮食买走了，粮食管理站的人还不晓得。在元通乡粮食管理站，一群过路的船筏工人未交粮票，也不办任何手续，就买走大米一百五十九斤。
    粮食部门“大放手”后，对机关、学校的用粮要求一律照准。购粮预决算审批制度流于形式，冒购粮食现象普遍发生。机关中干部出差要多少粮票就给多少。干部手上的许多粮票用不完，送给了亲友。学校本无流动人口，也领了大量机动粮和粮票。崇庆两个中学，10月份就积存了能够购买九千六百二十四斤粮食的粮票。
    由于对粮食供应工作放松了管理，近几个月来川西平原地区粮食销售数量激增。
