All counties under the Jinhua Special District of Zhejiang Province have generally started curing the domestically and internationally renowned "Jinhua Ham." The estimated annual output for 1957 will reach 315,000 pieces, an increase of 44.7% compared to this year.

    The Jinhua Branch of China Food Company and its affiliated units held a series of professional meetings starting in September. It was decided to set up twenty ham processing plants in fifteen counties including Dongyang and Yongkang. In addition to taking measures to ensure the supply of raw materials and strictly stipulating the specifications of the ham, they will also vigorously develop the excellent varieties of Jinhua Ham - the "Shangjiang Ham" of Dongyang County and the "Bamboo Leaf Smoked Ham" of Pujiang County.

    In addition, they will increase the production of "Hometown Salted Pork," and strive to transport and sell it to consumers in and outside the province around the New Year.

    增产“金华火腿”
    据新华社杭州29日电　冬、春两季是腌制火腿的季节，浙江省金华专区所属各县已经普遍开始腌制驰名国内外的“金华火腿”。预计1957年的年产量将达到三十一万五千只，比今年增加44.7％。
    中国食品公司金华分公司和所属单位，在9月份起召开了一系列的专业会议，决定在东阳、永康等十五个县设置二十个火腿加工场，除了采取措施保证原料供应和严格规定火腿的规格以外，并且将大力发展金华火腿中的优良品种——东阳县的“上蒋腿”和浦江县的“竹叶熏腿”。
    另外，还要增加生产“家乡南肉”，争取在新年前后运销省内外各地同消费者见面。
