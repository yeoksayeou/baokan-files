Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 19th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a television and radio address in Washington on the evening of the 18th.

	Nehru introduced India's long history and ancient civilization to the American audience. He mentioned that India abides by a democratic way of life and has always revered the spirit of tolerance and understanding. He pointed out that since India freed itself from its past rulers and gained political freedom, it has been eager to eliminate the many past ills, eliminate poverty, and raise the living standards of the people. He said that India is engaged in the task of rapidly and extensively developing the national economy. It has completed its First Five-Year Plan and has begun its Second Five-Year Plan.

	Nehru then said: Asia has awakened today, and those countries that have long been under foreign oppression have gained independence and are moving towards new ideals. "For them, as for us, independence is as important as the air they breathe to sustain life, and colonialism in any form or anywhere is hateful."

He said that India strives to maintain friendly relations with all countries, even if we may disagree with their policies or government structure. He believes that this can contribute not only to India but also to the greater cause of peace and friendship in the world.

    印度维护和平同所有国家友好
    任何地方的殖民主义都是可恨的
    新华社19日讯　华盛顿消息：印度总理尼赫鲁18日晚间在华盛顿发表电视广播演说。
    尼赫鲁向美国听众们介绍了印度的悠久历史和古老的文明。他谈到，印度遵守着民主的生活方式，并且一直崇奉容忍和谅解的精神。他指出，自从印度摆脱过去的统治者而获得政治上的自由以后，它就热切希望消除过去的许多祸患，消灭贫困，提高人民的生活水平。他说，印度正在从事迅速而大规模地发展国民经济的任务。它完成了第一个五年计划，并且已经开始了第二个五年计划。
    尼赫鲁接着说：亚洲今天已经苏醒了，那些长期处在外国压迫下的国家已经获得了独立，并且正在向着新的理想前进。“对它们来说，正像对我们来说一样，独立犹如它们维持生命所呼吸的空气一样重要，而任何形式或任何地方的殖民主义都是可恨的。”
    尼赫鲁谈到埃及和匈牙利事件，他对那些遭受灾难的人们表示同情，并且主张用和平的和建设性的方法来帮助解决这些问题。
    尼赫鲁认为，在这个原子时代里，和平已成为决定人类生存的东西。他说：维护和平是印度政策的中心目的。就是为了奉行这个政策，印度选择了不参加军事或类似的条约或联盟的道路。印度相信互不侵犯和互不干涉内政的原则，相信互相容忍的精神会发展，相信和平共处的能力。他说，印度努力同所有的国家保持友好关系，即使我们可能不同意它们的政策或者政府结构。他认为这不仅可以对印度，而且可以对全世界的更大的和平友好事业作出贡献。
    尼赫鲁说，美国和印度之间存在着友好的关系，他请求美国在印度实行伟大任务的当中给予友谊、合作和同情。
    尼赫鲁对他同艾森豪威尔的会谈表示满意，他说，他希望不久会有机会在印度欢迎艾森豪威尔。他最后表示了对世界和平的信心。
