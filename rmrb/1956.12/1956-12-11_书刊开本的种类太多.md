    There are too many book and periodical formats
    I am a printing worker. Based on my experience in practical work, I believe that there are too many book and periodical formats in our country. Take the current situation, for example, the formats of books and periodicals include octavo, nono, duodecimo, quarto, quinto, sextodecimo, octodecimo, vicentesimo, vicentesimo secundo, vicentesimo tertio, vicentesimo quarto, vicentesimo quinto, vicentesimo septimo, vicentesimo octavo, tricesimo, tricesimo secundo, tricesimo sexto, quadragesimo secundo, and dozens of other formats, and the dimensions between these formats only differ by one or two points. I don't think so many formats are necessary. It not only affects the appearance and uniformity of the books, but also causes a lot of waste and trouble. For example, adjusting to a certain format requires matching a wooden baseplate, the material consumption is increased, the plate making also takes more time, and at the same time, the frequent changes in format cause a lot of trouble for the workers. Therefore, I request that the relevant departments should uniformly stipulate several formats for the sizes of books and periodicals.

    Editor's Note: Reader Zhang Lijun's suggestion on improving the formats of books and periodicals is correct. It is understood that the Publishing Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture has already studied the issue of unifying formats with several publishing houses this year, advocating the use of geometric progression formats and abolishing non-geometric progression formats. However, in order to achieve diversification in format size to meet the needs of various books, and at the same time to have reasonable format methods that facilitate machine folding, there must be several fixed sizes of paper. The Publishing Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture has now formulated a preliminary plan for unified formats, and has also suggested that the Ministry of Light Industry study the production of several new sizes of paper. However, the production of new specifications of paper will take some time, and it is currently difficult to unify formats immediately. We are publishing the reader's opinion here to draw everyone's attention.

### 书刊开本的种类太多

    书刊开本的种类太多
    我是个印刷工人。根据我在实际工作中的体验，我认为我国书刊的开本太多了。拿目前来说吧，书刊的开本有八、九、十二、十四、十五、十六、十八、二十、二十二、二十三、二十四、二十五、二十七、二十八、三十、三十二、三十六、四十二等几十种开本，而这些开本之间的尺寸仅相差一分、两分。我认为这样多的开本不需要。它不仅影响了书本的美观和统一，而且也造成很大的浪费和麻烦。例如调一种开本就要配一付木底板，原材料损耗要多，制版也要增加时间，同时由于开数常常调换，会造成工人工作中很多的麻烦。因此，我要求有关方面最好能把书刊的开本尺寸，统一规定出几种开本。

    编者按：读者张立俊所提关于改进书刊开本的意见是正确的。据了解，文化部出版事业管理局今年已经同几个出版社一起研究统一开本问题，提倡使用几何级数的开本，取消非几何级数的开本。但是，要做到开本大小多样化，以适应各种书籍的需要，同时又要开法合理，便于机器折页，这就必须要有固定的几种大小尺寸的纸张。现在文化部出版事业管理局已制订了统一开本的初步方案，并且已建议轻工业部研究增制几种新尺寸的纸张。但是，生产新规格的纸张要有一段过程，目前还难以马上统一开本。现将读者的意见发表出来，以引起大家的重视。
