Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th: The engineering and technical personnel of the Northeast Second Engineering Company of the Ministry of Construction Engineering recently conducted preliminary inspections and evaluations of various advanced technologies and experiences promoted this year through free discussions.

This company promoted a total of more than 70 advanced experiences this year. According to statistics by the end of October, nearly 900 tons of steel, more than 8,800 tons of cement, and more than 8,200 cubic meters of wood have been saved for the country, reducing the total project cost by 38%. The company's engineering and technical personnel believe during the inspection and evaluation that most of the advanced technologies and experiences promoted this year can continue to be promoted next year. Among them, 21 items with greater savings value, such as "reinforced brick floor slabs," can be widely promoted in civil construction projects next year. Based on this year's construction results, the use of "reinforced brick floor slabs" can not only ensure project quality but also save 3.5 kilograms of steel and 12.8 kilograms of cement per square meter. They also believe that some individual advanced experiences must be promoted only when technical conditions permit, otherwise it will cause waste. For example, the "bamboo reinforced arch floor slabs" used this year, although they can save steel, have many processes and complex components, and require a high level of technical expertise to master; at the same time, the damage rate of these components during transportation is also high, and cannot be promoted if these problems are not solved. Also, "brick arch floor slabs" have slow construction progress and high costs, and should not be promoted in the future.

Currently, the engineering company is also organizing engineering and technical personnel and work section chiefs from its affiliated engineering offices to conduct further inspections of the advanced experiences promoted this year. The company plans to gather all opinions and make a final written appraisal.

The Shenyang Third and Fourth Construction Engineering Companies are also currently carrying out this work.

### 为明年增产节约打下基础  东北第二工程公司检查鉴定今年推行的先进经验

    为明年增产节约打下基础
    东北第二工程公司检查鉴定今年推行的先进经验
    新华社沈阳20日电　建筑工程部东北第二工程公司的工程技术人员，最近通过自由讨论，初步检查、鉴定了今年推行的各种先进技术和经验。
    这个公司今年共推行了七十多种先进经验，到10月末统计，已经给国家节省钢筋近九百吨、水泥八千八百多吨和木材八千二百多立方公尺；降低工程总成本38％。公司的工程技术人员在检查和鉴定的时候认为，今年所推行的先进技术和经验，绝大部分明年都可以继续推广。其中“钢筋砖楼板”等节约价值较大的二十一项，明年可以在民用建筑工程中广泛推行。根据今年的施工效果，采用“钢筋砖楼板”不但可以保证工程质量，每平方公尺还能节约三点五公斤的钢筋和十二点八公斤的水泥。他们还认为有个别先进经验，必须在技术条件允许的情况下才能推广，不然就会造成浪费。如今年采用的“竹筋拱型楼板”，虽然能够节约钢筋，但是工序多、构件复杂，必须有较高的技术水平才能掌握；同时，这种构件运输损坏率也较高，如果这些问题不解决就不能推广。还有，像
  “砖拱型楼板”，施工进度慢、成本高，今后也不宜推广。
    目前，这个工程公司还在组织所属各工程处的工程技术人员和工段长，对今年推行的先进经验作进一步的检查。公司准备将所有的意见集中起来作出最后的书面鉴定。
    沈阳市第三、第四等建筑工程公司目前也在进行这项工作。
