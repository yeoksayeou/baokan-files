Xinhua News Agency, London, December 5th: Ceylon's Prime Minister Bandaranaike, currently in London, has demanded that Britain rapidly return the bases it retains in Ceylon. He pointed out that allowing Britain to retain bases in Ceylon is incompatible with Ceylon's policy of non-alignment.

　　He said at a press conference on the 4th: "The sooner these bases are returned to us, and the sooner the equipment on the bases ceases to be used, the more beneficial it will be for both our countries and for the maintenance of the friendly relations that I sincerely hope exist between our two countries."

　　He condemned Britain for using bases in Ceylon to invade Egypt.

　　Speaking about the situation in Syria, he expressed concern about the development of the situation in the region.

　　He also said that he supports agreements based on the "Panchsheel" Five Principles and does not approve of military alliances such as the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Pact.

　　He believes that as long as the North Atlantic Treaty is abolished, the Warsaw Pact will be cancelled accordingly. However, the cancellation of the Warsaw Pact does not mean that the North Atlantic Treaty will be abolished. In this regard, he reminded everyone that the conclusion of the Warsaw Pact was to counter the North Atlantic Treaty. A reporter said that the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty was also caused by certain conditions. Bandaranaike corrected him, saying that it was not certain conditions, but the interpretation of these conditions by the leaders of certain countries.

　　锡兰总理要英国迅速交还基地
    谴责英国曾利用锡兰基地侵略埃及
    据新华社伦敦5日电　目前在伦敦的锡兰总理班达拉奈克要求英国迅速交还它在锡兰保有的基地。他指出，让英国在锡兰保有基地是同锡兰执行的不参加集团的政策不相容的。
    他4日在记者招待会上说：“这些基地越早交还我们，基地上的设备越早停止使用，对于我们两国、对于我极希望看到的我们两国之间存在的那种友好关系的维护，就越有利。”
    他谴责英国曾经利用锡兰的基地来侵略埃及。
    在谈到叙利亚情况的时候，他表示对这一地区的情势发展感到不安。
    他还说，他拥护以“潘查希拉”五项原则为基础的协定，而不赞成马尼拉条约和巴格达条约这样的军事联盟。
    他认为，只要废除北大西洋公约，华沙条约随着就会取消，然而取消华沙条约并不意味着北大西洋公约将会废除。在这方面，他提醒大家，华沙条约的缔结是为了对付北大西洋公约的。有一个记者说，北大西洋公约的缔结也是由某种条件引起的。班达拉奈克纠正他说，不是某种条件，而是某些国家的领导人对这些条件的解释。
