Annotations of Several Terms in Pavlov's Articles

    Samara Democratic Committee
    In 1918, due to the intervention of British and French imperialism, the Czechoslovak Legion rebelled within Soviet territory. The wealthy peasants in the Volga River basin and Siberia, along with some workers deceived by the reactionary Socialist-Revolutionaries, immediately launched a rebellion in response. In June, the Samara Democratic Committee, also known as the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly, was established on the banks of the Volga River. This committee was a reactionary government composed of White Guards and Socialist-Revolutionaries and was eliminated in the autumn of the same year.

    Kronstadt Rebellion
    Kronstadt is a fortress near Leningrad. The Kronstadt Rebellion occurred in March 1921. At that time, the Soviet state, having undergone a civil war against foreign armed intervention, suffered significant damage to its national economy, and the peasants became dissatisfied with the surplus grain collection system. Class enemies took advantage of this situation and continued to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. In Kronstadt, due to the deterioration of the composition of the naval sailors and the weakness of the local Bolshevik party organization, the enemy seized the opportunity to infiltrate and occupy the fortress. However, the counter-revolutionary rebellion was quickly suppressed by the heroic Red Army.

    Revisionism
    Revisionism is a philosophical theory of reformists in the workers' movement. Reformists try to convince workers that it is possible to transition to socialism without destroying the foundations of capitalism, eliminating the state apparatus of the bourgeoisie, and depriving the bourgeoisie of its ownership of the means of production, simply by adopting methods of "class cooperation" such as running cooperatives and distributing dividends. Thus, they pretend to support Marxist philosophy while attempting to use various bourgeois theories to modify the philosophical theoretical foundations of Marxism. They replace revolutionary dialectics with vulgar evolutionism (i.e., the view that movement is a simple process of growth, a slow quantitative development), thereby opposing the doctrines of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They declare that scientific socialism can tolerate idealist philosophy, attempting to disarm the proletariat and its party theoretically. Therefore, revisionists are bourgeois agents who undermine the workers' movement while wearing a socialist mask.

    Count Esterházy
    Count Esterházy was a large landowner during the Horthy fascist regime, when he and his family owned a quarter of the total land area of Hungary. During the dark days of the counter-revolutionary riot in Hungary, he actively engaged in activities in Budapest to restore the bourgeois landlord system. He once telephoned various embassies in Hungary saying, "I am Count Esterházy. I have resumed political activity. I intend to join the government soon. If necessary, you can contact me."

    Jacobin Dictatorship
    The Jacobin dictatorship (June 1793 to July 1794) was the most glorious stage in the 18th-century French bourgeois revolution. The Jacobins (named after their meeting place in the former Saint-Jacques monastery) represented the revolutionary bourgeoisie of the time, which opposed the feudal autocracy, and received the support of workers, peasants, and the petty bourgeoisie. After the French people overthrew the monarchy, the big bourgeoisie, represented by the Girondins, seized power, advocating compromise with domestic feudal forces and retreating in the face of foreign counter-revolutionary intervention from Austria, Prussia, Britain, and others. Thus, the Jacobins overthrew the rule of the Girondins, established a revolutionary dictatorship, mobilized the broad masses of the people to oppose the remnants of feudal forces, implemented many measures in line with the interests of urban and rural laborers, and defended the motherland against the attacks of foreign interventionists. However, the Jacobins could not avoid showing the limitations of the bourgeoisie in the revolution. In the autumn of 1793, the contradictions between the forces supporting the Jacobins intensified. The Jacobins did not accept the demands of the masses to confiscate the land of the landlords and abolish the maximum wage regulations, making the revolution more thorough, and thus lost the support of urban and rural laborers. On July 24, 1794, the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie launched a coup, overthrowing the Jacobin dictatorship and establishing a counter-revolutionary dictatorship. This marked the end of the first bourgeois revolution in France.

    Yugoslav Workers' Councils
    The Workers' Council is the highest management body in Yugoslav economic enterprises, one of the workers' self-management institutions. It is elected by all workers and staff members who participate in labor and have the right to vote under the Yugoslav Basic Law through secret ballot (in enterprises with no more than thirty workers, all employees are members of the Workers' Council). Workers manage their own enterprises through the Workers' Council. The Workers' Council decides on all matters related to production and work organization and passes resolutions on basic issues such as economic activities, organization, and internal relations within the enterprise. The Workers' Council elects the Enterprise Management Committee from its members as its executive body. The head of the enterprise is appointed by the People's Committee of the enterprise's location on a competitive basis. He is directly responsible for the enterprise's business and manages according to the decisions passed by the Workers' Council and the Management Committee.

    The first batch of workers' self-management institutions in the Yugoslav economy—Workers' Councils and Management Committees—were elected in 1950. This year, direct producers have elected their own self-management institutions for the sixth time.

    Anarcho-Syndicalism
    Anarcho-syndicalism is a type of anarchism. Like all anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists deny the necessity of a proletarian dictatorship under the slogan of opposing all states and regimes. They believe that the working class only needs trade union organizations, that strikes are the main means for the working class to fight against the bourgeoisie, and that they oppose workers participating in political struggles and organizing parties of their own class. In this way, they pretend to deny politics, but in essence, they are engaging in activities that split the workers' movement and oppose Marxism, trying to make "the working class submit to the politics of the bourgeoisie" (Lenin).

    Proudhon
    Proudhon (1809-1865) was a French political commentator, economist, and sociologist, one of the forerunners of modern anarchism, and a petty-bourgeois thinker. He fantasized about making small private ownership last forever and criticized large capitalist ownership from a petty-bourgeois standpoint. He stubbornly sought to maintain a social system of private ownership of the means of production, advocated using reformist methods to "improve" the situation of laborers, and opposed class struggle and proletarian revolution. He wrote works such as "The Philosophy of Poverty" from a metaphysical point of view. Marx's famous work "The Poverty of Philosophy" criticized Proudhon's "The Philosophy of Poverty."

    巴夫洛夫文章中几个名词的注释
    萨马拉民主委员会
    1918年，由于英法帝国主义的干涉，发生了苏联境内捷克斯洛伐克军团的叛乱。伏尔加河流域和西伯利亚一带的富农以及受到反动的社会革命党人的欺骗的一些工人，立即发动叛乱，起来响应。6月，在伏尔加河河畔成立了萨马拉民主委员会，这个委员会即所谓立宪会议议员委员会，是白卫分子和社会革命党人组成的反动政府，在同年秋天被消灭。
    喀琅施塔得暴动
    喀琅施塔得是在列宁格勒附近的一个要塞。喀琅施塔得暴动发生在1921年3月间。当时苏维埃国家经过反对外国武装干涉的国内战争，国民经济遭到很大的破坏，农民对余粮收集制产生了不满情绪。阶级敌人利用了这种情况，继续进行反革命活动。在喀琅施塔得，由于军舰水兵成分变坏，当地的布尔什维克党组织薄弱，敌人乘机混入并占领了这个要塞。但是，反革命叛乱很快便被英勇的红军镇压下去了。
    修正主义
    修正主义是工人运动中改良主义者的一种哲学理论。改良主义者力图使工人相信，不必摧毁资本主义的基础、消灭资产阶级的国家机关和剥夺资产阶级对生产资料的所有权，只要采用办合作社、分红利等“阶级合作”的办法，就可以过渡到社会主义。于是，他们就伪装拥护马克思主义哲学，而企图用各种各样的资产阶级的理论来修改马克思主义的哲学理论基础。他们用庸俗的进化论（即认为运动是简单的增长过程，是缓慢的量的发展）来代替革命的辩证法，从而反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。他们宣称科学的社会主义可以容忍唯心主义的哲学，企图从理论上解除无产阶级及其政党的武装。因此，修正主义者是带着社会主义假面具来破坏工人运动的资产阶级代理人。
    埃斯捷尔哈齐伯爵埃斯捷尔哈齐伯爵，是霍尔蒂法西斯统治时期的大地主，当时他和他的家族占有匈牙利全国土地面积的四分之一。在匈牙利反革命暴乱的黑暗日子里，他在布达佩斯积极进行恢复资产阶级地主制度的活动。他曾打电话通知各国驻匈大使馆说：“我是埃斯捷尔哈齐伯爵。我已恢复政治活动。我打算在最近参加政府。假如必要的话，你们可以同我联系。”
    雅可宾专政
    雅可宾专政（1793年6月到1794年7月）是十八世纪法国资产阶级革命中的一个最光辉的阶段。雅可宾派（因其会址设在前圣雅可修道院而得名）代表当时反对封建专制制度的革命的资产阶级，得到了工人、农民和小资产阶级的支持。法国人民推翻了君主政体后，以吉伦特派为代表的大资产阶级掌握了政权，主张同国内的封建势力妥协，并且在奥地利、普鲁士、英国等外国反革命干涉面前实行退却。于是，雅可宾派推翻了吉伦特派的统治，建立了革命的专政，发动广大人民群众去反对封建势力的残余，实行了很多符合城乡劳动者利益的措施，并且在外国干涉者的进攻中保卫了祖国。但是，雅可宾派在革命中不能不表现出资产阶级的局限性。1793年秋天，拥护雅可宾派的各派力量之间的矛盾加剧了。雅可宾派没有接受群众提出的没收地主土地、取消工资最高额的规定等要求，使革命进一步深入，因而失去了城乡劳动者的支持。1794年7月24日，反革命的资产阶级发动政变，推翻了雅可宾专政而建立了反革命专政。这也就是法国第一次资产阶级革命的终结。
    南斯拉夫的工人委员会
    工人委员会是南斯拉夫经济企业中的最高管理机构，是工人的自治机构之一，由参加劳动和根据南斯拉夫根本法有选举权的全体工人和职员以秘密投票方式选出（在工作者不超过三十人的企业中，全体员工都是工人委员会的委员）。工人们通过工人委员会来管理自己的企业。工人委员会决定有关生产和工作组织的一切事情，通过关于企业内的经济活动、组织和内部关系等基本问题的决议。工人委员会从它的成员中选出企业管理委员会，作为它的执行机构。企业负责人是在竞选的基础上由企业所在地的人民委员会任命的，他直接负责企业的业务，根据工人委员会和管理委员会通过的决定进行管理。
    南斯拉夫经济中的第一批工人自治机构——工人委员会和管理委员会——是在1950年选出的。今年，直接生产者第六次选出了自己的自治机构。
    无政府工团主义
    无政府工团主义是无政府主义的一种。正如一切无政府主义者一样，无政府工团主义者在反对一切国家和政权的口号下否认无产阶级专政国家的必要性。他们认为工人阶级需要的只是工会组织，罢工是工人阶级同资产阶级进行斗争的主要手段，而反对工人参加政治斗争和组织本阶级的政党。就这样，他们伪装否定政治，实质上进行着分裂工人运动、反对马克思主义的勾当，想使“工人阶级服从资产阶级的政治”（列宁）。
    蒲鲁东
    蒲鲁东（1809年—1865年）是法国的政论家、经济学家和社会学家，现代无政府主义的先辈之一，小资产阶级思想家。他幻想使小私有制永世长存，并从小资产阶级的立场批判了大资本主义所有制。他顽固地力求保持生产资料私有的社会制度，主张用改良主义的办法来“改善”劳动者的处境，反对阶级斗争和无产阶级革命。他用形而上学的观点写了“贫困的哲学”等著作。马克思的名著“哲学的贫困”，批判了蒲鲁东的“贫困的哲学”。
