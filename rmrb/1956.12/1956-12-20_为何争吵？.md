    Yunnan's Yuxi Prefecture is a major flue-cured tobacco producing area. This year, the region planted more than 400,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco, and the state plans to purchase more than 72 million jin of it.

    In previous years, the purchasing work could be completed in October; this year, from the beginning of August to November, less than one-third of the purchasing task has been completed. Why is this year's purchasing work so slow? Because much of the time for purchasing flue-cured tobacco has been taken up by arguing.

    In Yuxi County, arguments between agricultural cooperatives and purchasing stations happen every day. Agricultural cooperatives say that purchasing stations are suppressing grades and prices, while people in the purchasing departments say that the quality of this year's flue-cured tobacco is not as high as last year's. Comrade Liu Zijun, Secretary of the Yuxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China, believes that some agricultural cooperatives lack experience in growing flue-cured tobacco and their production management is not good, which affects the quality of the flue-cured tobacco; however, the average price per jin for the entire county should not be only four jiao one fen to four jiao six fen. Comrades in the purchasing department believe that the local Party committee is siding with the agricultural cooperatives and has a one-sided mass perspective. The failure to purchase flue-cured tobacco has caused some financial departments to complain: the tax bureau is clamoring that the purchasing bureau is not purchasing broken tobacco, sucker tobacco, and out-of-grade tobacco, so they cannot complete their tax revenue task; the supply and marketing cooperative says that it cannot process local tobacco and tobacco shreds; and the bank also says that it is affecting the work of currency withdrawal.

    In August, when the tobacco leaves purchased by Yuxi County were inspected, they were deemed to have been graded too high and not up to standard, and 7,000 yuan was deducted. The county purchasing bureau was very anxious. They held a meeting, and Director Li said to the people at each purchasing station: "From now on, whichever station purchases tobacco that is not up to standard, that station will be responsible; whoever purchases tobacco that is not up to standard, that person will be responsible." Then the purchasing stations also became nervous. According to the county bureau's arrangement, in addition to not purchasing sucker tobacco, broken tobacco, and out-of-grade tobacco, they had the idea of "rather low than high" in grading, and all tobacco that was not clearly graded and bundled was graded low. Farmers in Zhengjing, Guojing, Zhaowei, Songguan and other townships who had more than ten years of experience in growing flue-cured tobacco disagreed with the purchasing stations' suppression of grades and demanded that purchases be made according to the national standard samples, but the purchasing stations claimed that they "did not have" samples. So, they began to argue. When the argument had no result, some farmers carried the flue-cured tobacco back home, and some people scattered the flue-cured tobacco in the courtyard of the purchasing station and on the street while arguing and scolding. Luoche Township scattered more than 2,000 jin of flue-cured tobacco on the street and did not want it, and when they returned home, they used knives to chop the sucker tobacco growing on the tobacco plants and use it as fertilizer. Some agricultural cooperatives stored the flue-cured tobacco and did not sell it, so the purchasing stations in some townships could only receive three to five hundred jin of tobacco a day.

    The Yuxi County Committee of the Communist Party of China studied this situation and decided to transfer one deputy secretary of the county committee and one deputy secretary of each district committee to be responsible for leading the flue-cured tobacco purchasing work. At the same time, it summarized the advanced purchasing experience of following the mass line in Wacao, Gaocang, Gaoqiao and other townships, and promoted it throughout the county. Criticisms were made of the purchasing departments' style of not trusting the masses and not relying on the masses, as well as the one-sided views of the farmers. At the same time, a group of staff was organized to re-examine the flue-cured tobacco that had already been purchased. As a result of the re-examination, the purchasing department needed to refund nearly 70,000 yuan to the agricultural cooperatives in 30 townships. However, the cadres of the purchasing bureau, from top to bottom, were afraid that the masses would make trouble, that the Party committee would stand with the agricultural cooperatives, and that they would be responsible if they could not complete the task by purchasing at the grades assessed by the masses; therefore, the "deadlock" and arguing have not been completely eliminated to this day.

    为何争吵？
　　陈勇进　秦军光
    云南玉溪专区是烤烟的主要产地，今年全区种植烤烟四十多万亩，国家预计要在这里收购烤烟七千二百多万斤。
    往年在10月间，收购工作可以结束；今年从8月初开始到11月间，收购任务三分之一还没有完成。为什么今年的收购工作进行的如此迟缓？因为收购烤烟的时间，多被吵架占去了。
    在玉溪县，农业社和采购站吵架的事情天天发生。农业社说采购站压级压价，采购部门的人却说今年烤烟质量没有去年高。中共玉溪县委书记刘子钧同志认为：有些农业社种烤烟经验不足，生产管理不好，影响了烤烟质量；可是无论如何全县平均单价也不能只合四角一分到四角六分一斤。采购部门的同志认为当地党委同农业社是站在一边说话，有片面群众观点。烤烟收不着，使得一些财经部门也在叫苦：税务局嚷着采购局不收碎烟、杈烟、级外烟，因而不能完成税收任务；供销社说不能加工土烟和烟丝了；银行也说影响了货币回笼的工作。
    8月间，玉溪县采购的烟叶在验收的时候被认为提高了等级，不合规格，被扣了七千元。县采购局很着急，他们召开了会议，李局长向各采购站的人说：“今后那个站收的不合规格那个站负责，那个人收的不合规格那个人负责。”接着采购站也紧张起来了。他们按照县局的布置除不收杈烟、碎烟、级外烟外，在评定等级上有“宁低勿高”的思想，把分级扎把不清的烟一律往低处评。种烤烟有十几年经验的郑井、郭井、赵桅、宋官等乡的农民不同意采购站压级，要求按照国家规定的样品收购，而采购站推说“没有”样品。于是争吵起来了。争吵没有结果的时候，有些农民把烤烟背了回去，有的人连吵带骂把烤烟撒在采购站的院子里和大街上。洛河乡把二千多斤烤烟撒在街上不要了，回到家里又把长在烟棵上的杈烟用刀砍了当肥料。有些农业社把烤烟存起来不卖了，因此有些乡的采购站，一天只能收到三、五百斤烟。
    中共玉溪县委会研究了这种情况，决定抽调县委副书记和各区区委副书记各一人，负责领导烤烟收购工作。同时又总结了瓦窑、高仓、高桥等乡走群众路线的先进收购经验，在全县推广。对于采购部门不相信群众，不依靠群众的作风以及农民中的片面观点都提出了批评，同时又组织了一部分工作人员对已收购的烤烟进行复查。复查结果，采购部门需要退补将近七万元的钱给三十个乡的农业社。可是，采购局的干部从上到下都怕群众捣鬼，怕党委跟农业社站在一起，怕按着群众评的等级收下来交不了差要自己负责；因此“顶牛”吵架的事情，至今还没有完全消灭。
