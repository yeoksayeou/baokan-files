Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 30th – By the end of 1956, areas in Yunnan Province with a population of over 2.3 million from ethnic minorities had achieved ethnic regional autonomy.

Yunnan is home to over 5.6 million people from ethnic minorities, belonging to 20 major ethnic groups and 60 ethnic subgroups. Some ethnic groups have relatively concentrated communities, while others are scattered throughout the province's counties and cities. Since 1953, Yunnan Province has been systematically promoting ethnic regional autonomy. Now, with the exception of the Kawa ethnic group, which is still preparing, the areas where the Dai, Jingpo, Hani, Lisu, and Lahu ethnic groups reside have all established autonomous prefectures (districts) or autonomous counties. Since 1956, inland Yunnan has also established the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yongjian Hui Autonomous County, Weishan Yi Autonomous County, Ninglang Yi Autonomous County, and Gongshan Dulong and Nu Autonomous County, based on the wishes of the local ethnic groups. To date, Yunnan Province has five autonomous prefectures (districts) and eleven autonomous counties. The ethnic minority population in these areas accounts for over 40% of the total ethnic minority population in the province.

The areas where new autonomous prefectures or autonomous counties were established in 1956 underwent a relatively long period of preparation beforehand. Among them, the Dali area and Yongjian, Weishan, and other counties have basically completed agricultural collectivization, have a considerable number of communist cadres from their own ethnic groups, and have generally established grassroots Party organizations. Therefore, once the regional autonomous organs are established, they possess good conditions for nationalization. Before the establishment of regional autonomy in counties such as Ninglang and Gongshan, they also strengthened ethnic unity and cultivated ethnic cadres through various tasks. Among them, the Dulong ethnic group, with a total population of only over 2,500, and the Nu ethnic group, with only over 12,000, had Dulong people Kong Zhiqing and Nu people Peng Ende elected as the head and deputy head of the autonomous county, respectively, at the first session of the People's Congress of the autonomous county.

The people of various ethnic minorities scattered in the vast rural areas established ethnic townships through general elections in 1956. In Baoshan, Kunyang, Yao'an, and other 24 counties alone, nearly ten ethnic groups established more than 160 ethnic townships in the second half of 1956.

Recently, Lunan County, where the Sani people are the main residents, and Xundian County, where the Hui people are the main residents, are holding meetings of the county People's Congress and are about to formally establish autonomous counties. The work of establishing ethnic autonomous areas in areas where the Tibetan, Miao, Zhuang, Yao, and Naxi ethnic groups are the main residents is also being prepared, or is being discussed with local ethnic public figures and the masses.

### 云南二百三十万少数民族实现民族区域自治  全省已有五个自治州十一个自治县，一批新的自治县即将成立

    云南二百三十万少数民族实现民族区域自治
    全省已有五个自治州十一个自治县，一批新的自治县即将成立
    新华社昆明30日电　到1956年年底，云南省已经有二百三十多万少数民族人口的地区，实现了民族区域自治。
    居住在云南的少数民族共有五百六十多万人，分属于二十个主要民族和六十个民族支系。一部分民族有着比较集中的聚居区，其他杂居于全省各个县市。从1953年起，云南省便有计划地开始推行民族区域自治。现在，边疆地区除了佧瓦族正在准备以外，傣族、景颇族、哈尼族、傈僳族、拉祜族的聚居地方，已经全部建立了自治州（区）或自治县。1956年以来，云南内地又依据当地民族的意愿，分别建立了大理白族自治州，永建回族自治县，巍山彝族自治县，宁蒗彝族自治县和贡山独龙族、怒族自治县。至此，云南全省已经拥有五个自治州（区）和十一个自治县。这些地区的少数民族人口，占全省少数民族总人口的40％以上。
    1956年新建立自治州或自治县的地区，事先都经过了比较长时间的准备工作。其中大理地区和永建、巍山等县都已经基本上完成农业合作化，本民族的共产主义干部已经有相当数量，党的基层组织也都普遍建立，因此区域自治机关一经建立，便具备了民族化的良好条件。宁蒗、贡山等县在建立区域自治以前，也通过各项工作加强了民族团结，培养了民族干部。其中总人口只有二千五百多人的独龙族和只有一万二千多人的怒族，在自治县首届第一次人民代表大会会议上，独龙族人孔志清、怒族人彭恩德分别当选为自治县的正副县长。
    散居在广大农村的各少数民族人民，1956年通过普选分别成立了民族乡。仅保山、昆阳、姚安等二十四个县，1956年下半年就有近十种民族建立了一百六十多个民族乡。
    最近，居民成分以撒尼人为主的路南县和以回族为主的寻甸县，正在召开县的人民代表大会会议，即将正式成立自治县。在以藏族、苗族、僮族、瑶族、纳西族为主的地区，建立民族自治地方的工作也正在筹备，或者正在和当地民族的公众领袖人物及群众协商中。
