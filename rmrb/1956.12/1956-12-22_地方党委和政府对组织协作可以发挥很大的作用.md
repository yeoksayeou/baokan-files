    Local Party Committees and Governments Can Play a Significant Role in Organizing Collaboration
      Xie Zihe, Mayor of Yangquan City, Shanxi Province
    Yangquan is not a large city, but in our actual work, we increasingly feel that even in a city of this size, there are numerous collaborative tasks between the two parties of capital construction, between production and construction and transportation, and between commerce and production and construction, which require joint efforts and mutual cooperation to complete.
    This year, under the leadership of the Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Yangquan Municipal People's Committee has convened three collaboration meetings successively based on the requirements of all parties, resolving more than 360 specific collaboration issues, which have played a significant role in promoting and organizing the connection and balance of various links in production and construction. For example, this year, Yangquan's transportation tasks increased by more than half compared to last year, while transportation capacity decreased by one-third. However, due to relatively good cooperation in all aspects, the efficiency of the transportation company's cars and carriages exceeded the state-set targets for 1957, and increased by more than half compared to the actual efficiency in 1955, so that transportation roughly adapted to the needs of production and construction. This year, the basic construction tasks increased by more than half compared to last year, and in the second quarter, some housing construction investment was added, making the material supply very tight. We organized the material balance by season, month, ten-day period, and project, and mobilized various units to adjust and support each other. As a result, the material supply work was better than in any previous year.
    To organize collaborative work effectively, first, it is necessary to correct understanding. The need for collaboration and cooperation is inherently common, consistent, and frequent, but under normal circumstances, there are three different attitudes. One is to consciously and proactively complete the collaboration tasks, recognizing that the relationship between socialist enterprises and departments is one of mutual assistance and cooperation in completing common tasks. Another is to only do it when "conditions are right," and the completion of collaboration tasks is often passive. They believe that mutual collaboration is a last resort, and fantasize about being all-powerful. The third is "no reciprocation," only asking others to support themselves, but being unwilling to help others, and even pushing difficulties onto others. Although this is the attitude of a few individuals and individual units, it is indeed a reflection of capitalist management thinking on the issue of collaboration. Due to the above differences, especially because people with the third attitude "do not reciprocate," "buck-passing" phenomenon often occurs between each other, arguing about who has benefited and who has suffered losses. In response to this situation, at the first collaboration meeting in April this year, we used vivid facts to illustrate the correct relationship between socialist enterprises and departments, promoted mutual understanding, and proposed that as long as the collaboration is good now and in the future, old problems that occurred in the past collaboration would not be discussed, and "old accounts" would not be settled. In this way, everyone paid attention to actively thinking of ways to solve the current and future collaboration problems. For example, Yangquan Railway Station and Yangquan Mining Bureau, in the past, because they did not understand each other's actual difficulties enough, one party requested coal cars whenever they were available and loaded coal; the other party requested to load coal whenever there was coal available, and the debate continued endlessly. After the meeting, the two sides jointly studied the actual difficulties existing in the production and transportation balance, proposed unified technical measures, and implemented them separately, and the situation greatly improved.
    Second, corresponding collaborative organizations should be established. In the past few years, according to the requirements of collaborative tasks, the city's "Coal Transportation Joint Committee" and "Electricity Conservation Committee" were established, and these organizations played an important role in promoting the collaboration and cooperation of various units. However, these organizations can only be responsible for solving collaboration issues within a certain project or system. According to the development of the situation, if similar organizations are established again to solve collaboration problems, a situation of "multiple heads and fragmentation" will be formed. At the same time, the members of the Coal Transportation and Power Supply and Consumption Committees are all responsible comrades from various departments, who are too busy with their work to hold a committee meeting even once a year. It is only the department responsible comrades and specific undertakers who often contact each other, so it is felt that when solving collaboration problems, due to the instability of personnel and different positions, delays and "buck-passing" phenomenon still occur. Moreover, the collaboration aspects have also put forward new requirements. For example, the balanced transportation of stations and coal mines not only involves the loading and unloading operations of coal mines, but also involves the balanced production of coal mines, the supply of local building materials, the supply of electricity, and many other aspects, which require more extensive participation of representatives from all aspects to jointly do a good job in collaboration and cooperation. Therefore, at the second collaboration meeting this year, under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, the "Yangquan City Collaboration Representative Conference" was formally established. This is a regional collaborative organization voluntarily formed by various enterprises and departments in Yangquan City. Units voluntarily apply to participate, and collaborative representatives are appointed by the heads of the enterprises. On the original basis, several collaborative representative groups such as transportation, electricity, and material supply were divided to make the work more convenient and flexible.
    Third, establish necessary working systems. The following items have been and are being established: First, the contact system. The relevant parties should frequently exchange information and put forward collaboration requirements. For example, in coal transportation, the station and the mine have implemented a forecasting and confirmation system for picking up and delivering vehicles and loading and unloading operations on a five-day, daily, and shift basis. Second, the contract agreement system. For frequent and major collaborative tasks, the parties involved have signed contracts or agreements; for general or temporary collaborative tasks, there are also simple agreements. Third, the inspection system. In the use of electricity, a certain number of electricity supervisors are organized to regularly check the situation and problems in electricity use. In transportation, inspections and evaluations were carried out monthly and quarterly according to the joint labor competition conditions. This collaboration representative meeting summarized the collaborative tasks proposed at the previous meeting, inspired everyone to learn from the good, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. Fourth, the reward and punishment system. Both parties who actively cooperate to complete the collaborative tasks are commended or rewarded, and vice versa, criticism or even punishment is given.
    Of course, there are still many problems in the collaboration between enterprises in Yangquan City, and we need to organize collaboration and cooperation better.

    地方党委和政府对组织协作可以发挥很大的作用
  　山西省阳泉市市长　谢子和
    阳泉是一个不算大的城市，但是在实际工作中，我们愈来愈感到即使在这样一个不算大的城市里，基本建设的甲、乙双方之间，生产、建设同交通运输之间，商业同生产建设之间都有大量的协作任务，需要共同努力互助合作来完成。
    今年，阳泉市人民委员会在中共阳泉市委的领导下，根据各方面的要求，先后召开了三次协作会议，解决了三百六十多项具体的协作问题，对于促进和组织生产建设中各个环节的衔接、平衡，起了很大的作用。例如今年阳泉市的运输任务比去年增加半倍多，而运输力反减少了三分之一，但由于各方面协作比较好，运输公司的汽车、马车的效率都超过了1957年的国家规定指标，比1955年实际效率提高了半倍多，使交通运输大体上适应了生产建设的需要。今年基本建设任务比去年增加了半倍多，二季度后又增加了一部分房屋建筑投资，材料供应很紧张。我们组织了分季、分月、分旬、分工程项目的材料平衡，发动各个单位相互调剂、彼此支援。结果，材料供应工作比以往任何一年作得都好。
    要组织好协作工作，第一，要端正认识。协作配合的需要，本来是共同的、一致的、经常的，但在一般情况下，也有三种不同的态度。一种是自觉地主动地完成协作任务，他们认识到社会主义各企业、各部门之间的关系是在完成共同任务上的互助合作关系。另一种是“条件合适”才干，完成协作任务往往是消极的。他们认为，相互之间的协作是迫不得已；幻想自己万能。第三种是“有来无往”，只要求别人支援自己，自己却不愿帮助别人，甚至把困难推给别人。这虽然是少数人和个别单位的态度，但确是资本主义经营思想在协作问题上的反映。由于上述差别，特别是由于第三种态度的人“有来无往”，相互间就经常出现“扯皮”现象，吵嚷谁占了便宜，谁吃了亏。针对这种情况，我们在今年4月第一次协作会议上，用生动的事实说明了社会主义各企业各部门之间的正确关系，促进了互相之间的了解，并提出了只要现在和今后协作好，不问过去协作上发生的老问题，不算“老账”。这样，大家便都注意积极想办法解决当前和今后的协作问题。如阳泉车站和阳泉矿务局，过去因为了解对方的实际困难不够，一方要求啥时有车啥时装煤；一方要求啥时有煤啥时装车，争论不休。会议之后双方共同研究了产运平衡中存在的实际困难，提出了统一的技术措施，分别执行，情况大为好转。
    第二，要相应地建立协作组织。过去几年内根据协作任务要求，曾建立了全市“煤炭运输联合委员会”、“节约用电委员会”，这些组织在促进各单位的协作配合上起了重要的作用。但这些组织只能负责解决某项或某一系统内的协作问题，根据形势的发展，为了解决协作问题，如再成立类似的组织，会形成“多头分散”的局面。同时像煤炭运输、供用电委员会的组成人员又都是各部门的负责同志，他们因工作较忙，一年也开不成一次委员会会议，经常联系的也只是经办这些事情的部门负责同志和具体承办人员，这就感到在解决协作问题时，由于人员不固定，职务不同，还是产生了拖延“扯皮”现象。而且协作方面也提出了新的要求。如车站、煤矿的平衡运输，不仅牵涉到煤矿的装卸作业，而且涉及到煤矿的均衡生产，地方建筑材料的供应、电力的供应、以及其他方面的许多问题，就需要更广泛地吸收各方面的代表参加，共同搞好协作配合。因此，今年第二次协作会议上，在市委和市人民委员会的领导下，正式成立了“阳泉市协作代表会”。这是阳泉市各企业各部门自愿联合组成的地区性的协作组织，由各单位自愿申请参加，协作代表由企业负责人委派产生。在原有基础上，划分了运输、电力、物质供应等几个协作代表小组，使工作更方便、更灵活。
    第三，建立必要的工作制度。已经和正在建立的有以下几项：一是联系制度。有关双方要经常交换情况，提出协作要求。如煤炭运输中，站矿双方实行了按五日、按日、按班的取送车、装卸作业的预报确报制度。二是合同协议制度。凡属经常性的、重大的协作任务，有关方面都订立了合同或协定；一般的或临时的一些协作任务，也有简单的协议。三是检查制度。在使用电力方面，组织了一定数量的电力监察员，经常检查电力使用中的情况和问题。交通运输中按联合劳动竞赛条件，按月、按季进行了检查评比。本次协作代表会议对上次会议提出的协作任务作出总结，启发大家学习好的，开展批评和自我批评。四是奖惩制度。对于主动配合完成协作任务的双方都给予表扬或奖励，反之即给予批评以至处分。
    当然，阳泉市各企业之间在协作上还存在着不少问题，还需要我们更好地来组织协作配合。
