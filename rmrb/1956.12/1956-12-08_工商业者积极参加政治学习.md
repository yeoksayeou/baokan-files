　　Industrialists and Businessmen Actively Participate in Political Study
　　Xinhua News Agency, 6th. It has recently come to the knowledge of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce that the majority of industrialists and businessmen are actively participating in political study this year. Those capitalist industrialists and businessmen who are concentrated in big cities have the largest number of participants. In Shanghai, more than 100,000 industrialists and businessmen are studying in spare-time political universities, nineteen political schools in urban districts, and regular current affairs and policy lectures in various districts. Many of them combined their study content with visits to the Shanghai Workers' Movement Struggle History exhibition and the Shanghai Industrial Production Advanced Experience Exhibition at the Workers' Cultural Palace. In Tianjin, over 30,000 private personnel from joint state-private enterprises alone are participating in the study. In Guangzhou, over 80,000 people are participating. In Beijing, by the third quarter of this year, over 54,000 industrialists and businessmen had participated in the study, compared to only over 2,000 last year. In small and medium-sized cities across the country, industrialists and businessmen are also actively participating in political study.
　　Participants include upper-level figures from the industrial and commercial sectors, private personnel from joint state-private enterprises, small merchants and peddlers, and family members of industrialists and businessmen. Many private personnel who had attended universities and studied abroad, as well as elderly people in their sixties and seventies, also enthusiastically participated in the study. Political Consultative Conferences, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, and other organizations have organized spare-time political schools, short-term training courses, and current affairs and policy lectures for them. Industrialists and businessmen with higher levels of education generally study at spare-time political schools or short-term training courses, while small merchants and peddlers with lower levels of education mostly listen to current affairs and policy reports through lectures. Some professional corporations in some areas have also absorbed private personnel into cadre schools or cadre training courses for study. The content of study varies from place to place, but generally includes learning about the laws of social development, our great motherland, the general task of the state during the transition period, knowledge of political economics, and current affairs policies. In addition to listening to reports, they also discuss and summarize their learning experiences in light of reality.
　　Through study, industrialists and businessmen have initially understood the laws of social development and have criticized many incorrect ideas. Many people, through their experiences of changing from having only a quilt and a box to becoming capitalists, realized the cruel exploitation of workers by capitalist private ownership; the vast majority of people have recognized that the capitalist road is impassable and that they must combine their personal future with the future of the country, expressing their willingness to contribute to the socialist cause.
　　Currently, in various regions, many industrialists and businessmen are eager to learn new technologies and knowledge of socialist enterprise management in order to develop their labor skills and do a good job in their current positions.

　　工商业者积极参加政治学习
    新华社6日讯　各地工商业者今年积极参加了政治学习。据中华全国工商业联合会最近了解：原来资本主义工商业者较集中的大城市，参加学习的人数最多。上海市有十多万工商业者分别在业余政治大学、市区十九个政治学校和各区定期举行的时事政策讲座学习，他们中有许多人结合学习内容，参观了陈列在工人文化宫的上海工人运动斗争史料和上海市工业生产先进经验展览会。天津市仅公私合营企业的私方人员就有三万多人参加学习。广州市参加学习的人有八万多。北京市到今年第三季度，已有五万四千多个工商业者参加学习，而去年参加学习的只有二千多人。在各地中小城市里，工商业者参加政治学习的也很踊跃。
    参加学习的人，有工商界的上层人士，有公私合营企业的私方人员，有小商小贩，也有工商业者家属。许多念过大学和曾经在国外留学的私方人员以及六、七十岁的老人，也热情地学习。各地政治协商会议、民主建国会、工商业联合会、民主妇女联合会、民主青年联合会等组织，为他们举办了业余政治学校、短期训练班和时事政策讲座。文化水平较高的工商业者一般在业余政治学校或短期训练班学习，文化水平较低的小商小贩大多数通过讲座听时事政策报告。有些地区的专业公司还吸收私方人员到干部学校或干部训练班学习。学习内容各地不一，一般是学习有关社会发展规律、我们伟大的祖国、国家过渡时期的总任务、政治经济学等方面的知识，以及当前的时事政策，除了听报告以外，还联系实际进行讨论并总结学习心得。
    工商业者经过学习，初步了解了社会发展规律，批判了许多不正确的思想。许多人在学习中，并且从自己由只有一个铺盖、一个箱子的人变而为资本家的经历中，认识到资本主义私有制对工人的残酷剥削；绝大部分人认清资本主义道路走不通了，必须把个人的前途同国家的前途结合起来，表示愿意为社会主义事业作出贡献。
    现在各地都有不少工商业者为了锻炼劳动本领，做好本岗位工作，迫切要求学习新的技术和社会主义企业经营管理的知识。
