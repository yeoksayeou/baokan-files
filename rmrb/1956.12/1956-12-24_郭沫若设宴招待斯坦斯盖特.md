Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and his wife hosted a banquet tonight in honor of Viscount Stansgate, a member of the British House of Lords, and his wife.

    Guo Moruo delivered a speech at the banquet, welcoming Stansgate and his wife to China. He expressed his hope that their visit would enhance mutual understanding and the development of friendship between the Chinese and British people.

    Stansgate said that he and his wife had visited Beijing twenty-two years ago, and this time, revisiting Beijing, he saw great changes. He said that Beijing has beautiful architecture and magnificent palaces. The new China has not only preserved these long-standing cultural relics but also taken care of the needs of the workers and made efforts to improve the people's living standards.

    Speaking of the position and role of the new China in the international arena, Stansgate said that there are now two forces in the world, one is the evil force that attempts to split China and split the world, and the other is the benevolent force that advocates world unity. He said that many members of the British Parliament advocate world unity, world peace, and oppose war. He also said that the issue of China's representation in the United Nations has not yet been resolved, and this situation must be corrected.

    Among those present at the banquet were Zhou Jianren, Zhang Su, and Liao Chengzhi, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs; Qian Duansheng, Vice President; and well-known figures from all walks of life, including Li Dequan, Xu Deheng, Chu Tunan, Huang Qixiang, and Wei Lihuang.

    郭沫若设宴招待斯坦斯盖特
    新华社23日讯　郭沫若副委员长和夫人今晚举行宴会，招待英国上议院议员斯坦斯盖特子爵和他的夫人。
    郭沫若在会上致词，对斯坦斯盖特和夫人来中国访问表示欢迎。他希望通过他们这次访问能增进中英两国人民相互间的了解和友谊的发展。
    斯坦斯盖特说，在二十二年前他和他的夫人曾来过北京，这次重访北京看到北京有了很大变化。他说，北京有着美丽的建筑和宏伟的宫殿，新中国既注意保存了这些悠久的文化古迹，又照顾了工人们的需要，为提高人民的生活水平而作了努力。
    在谈到新中国在国际间的地位和作用时，斯坦斯盖特说，现在世界上有两种势力，一种是企图分裂中国、分裂世界的恶势力，一种是主张世界团结的善良势力。他表示，英国许多议员都是主张世界团结、世界和平和反对战争的。他还说，中国在联合国的代表权问题，直到现在还没有解决，这种情况必须纠正。
    出席宴会的，有全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员周建人、张苏、廖承志，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席包尔汉，中国人民外交学会会长张奚若、副会长钱端升，以及各界著名人士李德全、许德珩、楚图南、黄琪翔、卫立煌等。
