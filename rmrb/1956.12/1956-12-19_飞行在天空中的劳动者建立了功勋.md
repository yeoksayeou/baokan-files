Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 18th:

    They fly over farmland, eliminating pests and diseases; fly over forests, surveying resources and detecting fires; fly over riverbanks, conducting water conservancy surveys; fly over barren mountains and wild fields, searching for underground treasures. In agricultural aviation alone, nearly seven thousand sorties were flown this year, covering a working area of over 2.8 million mu.

    China's specialized aviation, serving agriculture, forestry production, water conservancy construction, geological exploration, and other undertakings, has achieved great accomplishments this year.

    The head of the specialized aviation team of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, based in Tianjin, told reporters: As of December 10, this year's specialized flight tasks have been completed 109.6%. This almost doubles the target set by the first Five-Year Plan for 1957.

    The scope of China's civil aircraft serving agriculture is gradually expanding. This team only did locust and late-stage cotton bollworm control last year, but this year it has added five new tasks. They have successively treated wheat sucking aphids in Henan, Gansu and other provinces, controlled rice stem borers in the Nanchang area of Jiangxi Province, controlled rice blast in the suburbs of Tianjin, controlled early-stage cotton bollworms in many provinces, and conducted foliar fertilization of wheat for the state-owned Friendship Farm. According to reports from the agricultural departments of Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Shandong provinces, aircraft pest control on 180,000 mu of cotton fields has resulted in an increase of approximately five million jin of seed cotton.

    This year, the specialized aviation team's aircraft took many photographs over the primitive forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, Qinling Mountains, and other areas, and cooperated with the Ministry of Forestry's aerial survey team to conduct visual aerial surveys, obtaining preliminary data on the density, tree species, and reserves of these forests. This year, they also discovered fifty forest fires in the air over forest areas, which played a significant role in preventing and extinguishing forest fires.

    The aircraft responsible for water conservancy aerial surveying this year conducted extensive aerial surveys over the Yellow River and its tributaries, spanning nearly a thousand miles from Xi'an in the west to Jinan in the east. Almost the entire Sanmenxia Reservoir area was photographed. In terms of physical prospecting, last year only one type of aircraft and one type of instrument were used, but this year four types of aircraft and three types of instruments were used. Pilots, accompanied by experts and mining technicians, navigated the skies of Northeast, Central, and South China to conduct general surveys of petroleum or metal mineral deposits.

    This specialized aviation team was formally established in Tianjin in 1954. Since its establishment, its business has developed extremely rapidly. Taking agricultural aviation as an example, it flew a total of 6,908 sorties this year, covering a working area of more than 2.8 million mu. However, due to a lack of experience and insufficient equipment, there are still some chaotic phenomena in specialized aviation, which also falls far short of meeting objective needs.

### 飞行在天空中的劳动者建立了功勋

    飞行在天空中的劳动者建立了功勋
    他们飞过农田，消灭病虫害；飞过森林，调查资源，侦察火情；飞过河流两岸，进行水利测量；飞过荒山野地，搜索地下宝藏。只是农业飞行，今年就飞了将近七千架次，工作面积在二百八十万亩以上。
    新华社天津18日电　为农业林业生产、水利建设、地质勘探等事业服务的我国专业航空，今年获得很大成就。
    设在天津的中国民用航空局专业航空队的负责人对记者说：截至12月10日为止，今年的专业飞行任务已经完成109.6％。几乎超过第一个五年计划规定的1957年指标的一倍。
    我国民用飞机为农业服务的范围在逐步扩大。这个队去年只做了灭蝗和灭后期棉虫两项工作，今年又新增加了五项。他们先后为河南、甘肃等省除治了小麦吸浆虫，为江西省南昌地区防治稻螟虫，为天津市郊区防治稻瘟病，为好多省除治前期棉虫，还为国营友谊农场进行了小麦根外追肥。据湖北、安徽、江西、山东四个省农业部门的反映，由于飞机在十八万亩棉田上治虫，使这些棉田增产了约五百万斤籽棉。
    今年专业航空队的飞机在大兴安岭、秦岭等原始森林上空，摄取了很多照片，又配合林业部的航空调查队进行空中目测，获得了这些森林的密度、树种、储藏量等初步资料，他们今年还在林区上空发现了五十次火情，对于防止和扑灭林火起了很大作用。
    担任水利航空测量任务的飞机，今年在西起西安东到济南将近一千里的黄河及其支流上空进行了广泛的航空测量，三门峡水库区一带差不多全部拍了照片。在物理探矿方面，去年只使用了一种飞机和一种仪器，今年使用了四种飞机和三种仪器，飞行员带着专家和探矿技术员航行在祖国的东北、华中和华南，进行石油或金属矿藏的普查工作。
    这个专业航空队是1954年在天津正式建立的，建队以来业务发展极为迅速，仅以农业飞行为例，今年共飞行了六千九百零八架次，工作面积达二百八十多万亩。但是由于经验不足和设备不够，专业航空中还有一些忙乱现象，也远远不能满足客观的需要。
