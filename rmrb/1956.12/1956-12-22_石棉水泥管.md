    Asbestos Cement Pipes
    (This newspaper reports) China has successfully trial-produced its first asbestos cement pipe.

    Asbestos cement pipes have many advantages, including high compressive strength, resistance to corrosion, and non-conductivity. They do not breed bacteria even after twenty years of use, and their water conveyance capacity remains unchanged. Because its thermal conductivity is two-hundredths that of steel pipes, it does not easily heat up during ventilation, and its weight is much lighter than steel pipes, making it more convenient to transport. More importantly, the use of this type of pipe can save a large amount of steel. Using asbestos and cement to make a thousand meters of pipe can save 130 tons of steel, and the price is fifteen-sixteenths cheaper than cast iron pipes. According to estimates based on the situation of China's newly built railways, using asbestos cement pipes can save more than 10,000 tons of steel each year.

    Currently, the Fengtai Bridge Factory is preparing to expand its equipment, and a large number of new products will soon be transported to construction sites. (According to People's Railway)

    石棉水泥管
    本报讯　我国第一根石棉水泥管已经试制成功。
    石棉水泥管的优点很多，抗压力大、不锈蚀、不导电；使用二十年还不生菌，输水能力不变。因为它的传热性为钢铁管的二百分之一，通风时不易发热，重量也比钢铁管轻多了，搬运起来比较便利。更重要的是，使用这种管子可以节约大批钢材。用石棉和水泥做一千公尺长的管子，能省钢铁一百三十吨，价格比铸铁管便宜十六分之十五。根据我国新建铁路的情况估算，采用石棉水泥管，每年可以节省钢铁一万多吨。
    目前，丰台桥梁厂正筹备扩建设备，不久即将有大量新产品运到工地。　（据人民铁道）
