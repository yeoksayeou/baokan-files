    Inner Mongolia Party Committee Studies Streamlining Plan
    Party Committee Organs Prepare to Reduce Personnel by Half

    (Our Newspaper News) On December 22nd, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee convened a joint meeting of leading Party members' groups from directly subordinate organs of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to discuss the streamlining plans of various organs. At the meeting, Ulanhu, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee, proposed that, according to preliminary plans, the Party Committee organs are preparing to reduce personnel by 50%. Comrade Ulanhu believed that this plan was achievable. He said that after the merger of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the former Suiyuan Province, there had been no serious streamlining, and the number of personnel had continued to increase. For example, in 1952, the original Inner Mongolia Branch of the CPC Central Committee had only 260 people, while today it has reached more than 600. He said: In the past, if 260 people could do the work, then today, with a 50% reduction, leaving more than 300 people, the work can certainly be done completely. Therefore, he asked all units to carefully explore the potential for streamlining. The people attending the meeting expressed great interest in the Party Committee's streamlining plan, and some units expressed their intention to re-study the streamlining plan and resolutely implement the spirit of streamlining organs.

    内蒙古党委研究精简方案
    党委机关人员准备减少一半
    本报讯　12月22日，内蒙古党委召开内蒙古自治区直属机关党组负责同志联席会，讨论了各机关精简机构的方案。会上内蒙古党委书记乌兰夫同志提出，根据初步打算，党委机关准备精简50％的人员。乌兰夫同志认为这个方案是可以实现的。他说，内蒙古自治区和原绥远省合并后就没有认真精简，人员反而继续增加。如在1952年原中共中央内蒙古分局只有二百六十人，而到了今天却达到六百多人。他说：过去如果有二百六十人就把工作做了，那么今天精简50％，还剩下三百多人，工作当然完全可以做下去。因此，他要求各单位必须仔细地挖掘精简的潜力。与会的人们对党委的精简方案表示了很大兴趣，有些单位表示从新研究精简方案，坚决贯彻精简机构的精神。
