    A Comparison of Two Types of Stencil Paper
    I work as a typist and am keenly aware that there is a great difference in the quality and price of stencil paper. The "Shuguang" (Dawn) brand stencil paper produced by the Zhejiang Provincial Local State-Owned Wenzhou Paper Mill is very good to use. After printing four hundred copies, there are no "black spots" at all, and the price is relatively low, only 9.50 yuan per box of fifty sheets. This kind of stencil paper also has a thin backing sheet in the middle of each sheet, which is very convenient for proofreading. The "Shuangquan" (Double Circle) brand stencil paper, manufactured by the Shanghai Joint State-Private China Stationery Company, used to be a famous brand; however, its quality has declined now. We bought a box of "Shuangquan" brand stencil paper manufactured in July of this year, and it started to change color after only two months. When printing to three hundred copies, black spots appeared, and the handwriting was blurred. The price of this kind of stencil paper is also relatively expensive. In the past, it sold for 10.50 yuan per box of fifty sheets, but now it sells for 11.50 yuan. I hope that the China Stationery Company will improve the quality of stencil paper and reduce costs.

    Inconsistent Oil Ink Consistency
    We have always used "Gengsheng" (Rebirth) brand oil ink produced in Guangzhou, but recently we found that the quality of this oil ink has decreased. Some are too thin, some are too thick, the printed handwriting is very light, and it is not easy to dry. Later, we switched to "Shima" (Lion Horse) brand oil ink produced in Shanghai, but this oil ink is even thinner, like muddy water, the color is also very light, and it damages the stencil paper, making it very difficult to use. I hope that the factories manufacturing these two kinds of oil ink will quickly improve the quality of their products.

    Unsatisfactory Mimeograph Machine
    Our factory bought a mimeograph machine produced by the Tianjin Yicheng Yong Tengxie Machine Factory. This mimeograph machine is very difficult to use. Its screen plate is narrow, the uprights on both sides are too high, and the oil roller is too long. When in use, the oil roller cannot reach the printing mesh of the screen plate, and when it is rolled at an angle, it hits the wooden frame on both sides. Therefore, a portion of the characters are often not printed. The parts of this mimeograph machine are also not durable, such as the screws on the rear of the screen plate, which break after being used two or three times.

    两种腊纸的对比
    我是做打字工作的，深感腊纸的质量和价格相差很大。浙江省地方国营温州皮纸厂出产的曙光牌腊纸很好用，油印四百份没有一点“黑斑”，而且售价较低，每盒五十张，只卖九元五角。这种腊纸，每张中间还有一张薄型衬纸，校对很方便。上海公私合营中国文具社制造的双圈牌腊纸，本来是名牌货；但是现在质量下降了。我们买了一盒今年7月出厂的双圈牌腊纸，仅仅放了两个月就开始变色了，油印到三百份，就出现黑斑，字迹也模糊了。这种腊纸的价钱也比较贵，每盒五十张，过去卖十元五角，现在卖十一元五角。希望中国文具社改进腊纸质量、降低成本。

    浓稀不当的油墨
    我们历来都用广州出产的更生牌油墨，最近发现这种油墨的质量降低了。有的过稀，有的过浓，印出来的字迹很淡，而且不容易干。后来我们又改用上海出产的狮马牌油墨，这种油墨更是稀得像泥水一样，颜色也很淡，并且伤害腊纸，很不好使用。希望制造这两种油墨的工厂赶快改进产品质量。

    不好用的油印机
    我们工厂买了一台天津义成永誊写机制造厂出产的油印机。这台油印机很不好用，它的纱盘子狭窄，两侧的梆竖摆高，油辊过长。在使用的时候，油辊挨不到纱盘的印纱，把它斜着来滚，又碰到两侧的木框。因此，往往有一部分字印不上。这种油印机，零件也很不耐用，如纱盘子后尾上的螺丝钉，用两三次就坏了。
