Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 28th December -- Indonesian Minister of Information Sudibjo told a "Dongxing Daily" reporter on the evening of December 27th that Simbolon's rebellion, endangering national security and unity, should not be seen as an isolated incident. He warned that vigilance must be maintained against the possibility of foreign colonial forces exerting influence.

The Minister of Information mentioned the example of how colonialists used the Baghdad Pact to incite conflict among Asian and African nations. He then said that they would use the Manila Treaty Organization to deal with Indonesia. The Indonesian people must maintain a vigilant attitude towards all possible events.

Today's "Dongxing Daily" also reported that since Simbolon's rebellion, some Western figures both inside and outside Indonesia have been very active. When Simbolon "took over" the North Sumatra government, personnel from certain Western countries' diplomatic missions in Medan were present. When U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Cumming, met with Indonesian government officials on the 27th, he expressed the U.S. government's political view on the North Sumatra incident: that in a situation where a certain regime is effectively in control of a region, the U.S. government might recognize this regime in order to protect the interests of its capital.

The newspaper also said that on the 27th, the Indonesian government requested the British Embassy in Indonesia to explain why a British plane landed in Medan on the afternoon of the 26th. At that time, Medan was still under Simbolon's control. It is said that the landing of the British plane did not receive the consent of the Indonesian government.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 28th December -- The Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association announced today that it still supports the current cabinet.

The party's Central Committee said in a statement issued this morning that they believe any action that causes a crisis in the cabinet at this time is irresponsible.

The Islamic Teachers Association made the above decision at a Central Committee meeting held on the evening of the 27th. All the party's ministers in the current cabinet attended the meeting.

Currently, the Masyumi Party, which insists on dissolving the current cabinet, appears very isolated. Two of the three major government parties—the Nationalist Party and the Islamic Teachers Association—do not agree with the Masyumi Party's opinion. The largest opposition party, the Indonesian Communist Party, has clearly expressed its support for the current cabinet.

The Masyumi Party's congress in Bandung yesterday passed a resolution demanding the dissolution of the current cabinet. There are reports that if other government parties do not agree with its motion to overthrow the cabinet, it will withdraw its cabinet members.

    印度尼西亚情报部长谈国内政局
    号召警惕殖民主义势力的影响
    伊斯兰教师联合会决定支持现内阁
    新华社雅加达28日电　印度尼西亚情报部长苏迪比约12月27日晚对“东星报”记者说，不能把西姆波朗危害国家安全和统一的叛变行动看成是一个孤立事件。他警告说，必须警惕外国殖民主义势力的影响的可能性。
    情报部长谈到了殖民主义者如何通过巴格达条约使亚非民族互相倾轧的例子，他接着说，他们是会通过马尼拉条约组织来对付印度尼西亚的。印度尼西亚人民必须对一切可能的事变保持警惕的态度。
    今天的“东星报”还报道说，自从发生西姆波朗的叛变以后，在印度尼西亚国内外的一些西方人士非常活跃，当西姆波朗“接收”北苏门答腊政权时，有某些西方国家驻棉兰的外交机关人员在场。美国驻印度尼西亚大使柯明在27日拜会印度尼西亚政府人士时，就北苏门答腊事件表示了美国政府的政治观点：就是在某个政权在事实上掌管某地区的情况下，为了维护自己资本的利益，美国政府是可能承认这个政权的。
    报纸还说，印度尼西亚政府在27日还要求英国驻印度尼西亚大使馆说明一架英国飞机于26日下午在棉兰降落的原因。那时，棉兰还在西姆波朗的控制之下。据说，英机的降落并未得到印度尼西亚政府的同意。
    新华社雅加达28日电　印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会今天宣布仍旧支持现内阁。
    这个党的中央委员会在今天早上发表的声明中说，他们认为目前任何使内阁发生危机的做法都是不负责任的。
    伊斯兰教师联合会在27日晚上举行的中央委员会会议上作出了上面的决定。参加这个会议的还有这个党在现内阁中的全部部长们。
    现在，坚持解散现内阁的马斯友美党显得非常孤立。三大政府党中的两大党——国民党和伊斯兰教师联合会都不赞成马斯友美党的意见。在野的第一大党印度尼西亚共产党已经明确表示支持现内阁。
    在万隆举行的马斯友美党代表大会昨天已经通过了一项决议要求解散现内阁。有消息说，如果其他各政府党不同意它的倒阁主张，它将撤回它的阁员。
