    "Filial Piety" and Support
    Huo Li

    The feudalistic "filial piety" of "the father wants the son to die, and the son has no choice but to die" was the top moral standard of our feudal society; things are different now. The primary moral standards of our new society are patriotism, collectivism, and wholeheartedly serving the people.

    However, negating feudalistic filial piety does not mean abolishing the reasonable and justifiable relationship between father and son in the new society. This is the mutual support obligation between parents and children stipulated in the current Marriage Law. On the one hand, parents must raise their children, and on the other hand, children must support their parents.

    On October 9th, the Shijiazhuang Daily recorded the following incident in a miscellaneous essay titled "Crows Feed Back, Lambs Kneel to Suck": A technician in a certain factory has a high salary and a wealthy life. His father is blind and his mother is old and frail. In the past, the son was quite good, sending home ten or twenty yuan each month; last year, the son got married, and the son's joy immediately turned into the parents' sorrow. The son no longer sends money home because he is planning to save money to buy his wife a watch, as well as a radio and two bicycles.

    This incident reminds me that when senior agricultural cooperatives were established in rural Hebei this spring, some individual farmers (mainly those whose families had separated) were unwilling to support their parents, using the excuse: In the past, you had land to support you, but now we have implemented payment according to labor. Whoever labors, eats; you go and labor to support yourself! A few months ago, when I went to Gaoyang, I did see an old woman in her sixties abandoned by her son, living a very lonely and desolate life: no one to fetch water, no one to gather firewood, relying entirely on her old bones to manage everywhere. Fortunately, she is a "Five Guarantees" household, and the cooperative takes care of her grain. The son's reason for not supporting her is: they have been separated for a long time, and he has many children. So, the old woman should be left to suffer.

    Once, at a meeting discussing the "Five Guarantees" issue, I heard several county-level cadres raise the phenomenon that farmers were dissatisfied with some cadres not sending money home to support their parents, but instead wanting the agricultural production cooperative to take care of them. It is said that a certain district head, who has now been transferred to a certain place as a section chief, brought his wife and children to his "post" not long after taking office, leaving his old mother alone at home, not giving her a penny, but repeatedly writing letters to the cooperative and township asking for "Five Guarantees." The theory of these people is: "The benefits the state gives to cadres should be enjoyed by the cadres themselves."

    Not supporting parents and being able to put forward one's own theory, I really admire the creativity of such people, but the common people feel that this is unfair, because people remember the loving and hard work of their parents in raising them. They cannot go against their conscience and abandon their parents when they lose their ability to work.

    Since supporting parents is already stipulated in the Marriage Law, it is not only a moral issue, but also a legal responsibility.

### “孝道”和扶养

    “孝道”和扶养
    霍藜
    “父要子死，不得不死”的封建主义的“孝道”，是我国封建社会头一条道德标准；现在不同了，现在社会首要的道德标准是爱国主义、集体主义、全心全意为人民服务。
    但是，否定了封建主义的孝道，并不等于取消新社会父子之间的合情合理的关系。这就是现在婚姻法里所规定的父母子女互相扶养的义务，一方面，父母必须抚养自己的儿女，另一方面，儿女也必须赡养自己的父母。
    10月9日，石家庄日报在题为“乌鸦反哺，羊羔跪乳”的杂谈里记载着这样一件事：某工厂有一个技术员，待遇很高，生活富裕，父亲双目失明，母亲老病身衰。过去儿子总算不错，每月还接济家里十元二十元的；去年儿子结婚了，儿子的喜庆立刻化为父母的愁苦。儿子再也不寄钱回家了，原因是儿子正计划积钱给爱人买手表，还要买一架收音机和两辆自行车。
    这事使我想起今年春天河北农村实现高级合作化时，有个别农民（主要是父子分过家的）不愿养活父母，借口说：从前你有养老地养活你，现在已经实行按劳取酬，谁劳谁吃，你自己去劳动养活自己吧！前几个月，我到高阳，确实也看到一个六十多岁的老太太被儿子遗弃，过着非常孤单凄凉的生活：饮水无人提，烧柴无人拾，全仗着一副老骨头到处张罗。幸而她是“五保”户，粮食由社里照顾。儿子不养活的理由是：早已分居了，自己孩子多。这样就该剩下老婆子去受活罪了。
    有一次，一个会议谈论“五保”问题，我听到好几个县的干部都提出农民不满有些干部不寄钱回家养活父母，而要农业生产合作社包起来的现象。据说，有一位区长现在调到某处当科长去了，到职不久，就把自己的老婆孩子接到“任”上，单丢下自己的老母在家，分文不给，却三番五次写信给社和乡里要求“五保”。这些人的理论是：“国家给干部的待遇，干部应该自己享受。”
    不扶养父母，而且能提出自己的理论，我真佩服这种人的创造性，但是老百姓都觉得这事不公平，因为人们都记得自己曾受父母亲切辛劳的养育，他们不能昧着良心到父母失掉劳动力的时候抛却父母。
    扶养父母既已规定在婚姻法中，那它就已经不仅是道德问题，而且是法律责任问题了。
