Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 30th: Cambodian King Suramarit stated yesterday that he hopes San Yun will continue to form a new cabinet.

The King issued an order yesterday accepting the resignation of San Yun's cabinet. At the same time, he said, "While the country is still in a difficult period, I hope that you will continue to correctly implement the political line of the People's Socialist Community led by Prince Sihanouk, and make it achieve the greatest success."

The San Yun cabinet resigned on December 19th after the National Assembly passed a vote of no confidence in its Minister of Finance and Industrialization, Hu Sen'a, and the Secretary of State for Industry and Commerce, Ke Sang, who were accused of being involved in privately transporting textiles to South Vietnam. It is revealed that Hu Sen'a and Ke Sang have decided not to participate in the new cabinet, even if it is led by San Yun as Prime Minister.

Prince Sihanouk has suggested to the King that San Yun form a new cabinet.

    柬埔寨国王希望桑云继续组阁
    新华社金边30日电　柬埔寨国王苏拉玛里特昨天表示希望桑云继续组织新内阁。
    国王昨天发表命令，接受桑云内阁辞职。同时，他又说，“当国家依然处在艰苦的时期的时候，我希望你将继续正确地实现由西哈努克亲王领导的人民社会同盟的政治路线，并且使它获得最大的成功。”
    桑云内阁是在国民议会对它的财政计划和工业化大臣胡森阿、工商国务秘书科桑投不信任票以后，在12月19日辞职的。这两位内阁阁员被指为参与把纺织品私自运往南越。据透露，胡森阿和科桑已经决定不参加即使是由桑云为首相的新内阁。
    西哈努克亲王曾经向国王建议由桑云组织新阁。
