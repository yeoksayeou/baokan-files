    Hail the Victory of the Egyptian People
    The crestfallen Anglo-French invading forces have completely withdrawn from Egyptian territory in the fading dusk of the 22nd. The heroic Port Said and its residents have returned to the embrace of their motherland after experiencing more than forty days of darkness. The complete withdrawal of the Anglo-French invading forces from Egypt and the recovery of Port Said is a great victory for the Egyptian people's heroic resistance against aggression and defense of national independence and sovereignty, a great victory for all oppressed nations in the world against Western colonialism, and a great victory for world peace forces against war forces! Now, the residents of Port Said and all the Egyptian people are rejoicing for their victory, and all righteous people in the world are cheering for this victory!
    The Anglo-French aggressors did not gain anything in the war of aggression against Egypt and were forced to withdraw completely from Egyptian territory. This proves that their policy of armed aggression has completely failed, and that the era in which colonialists attempted to suppress the national independence movements of various countries with the gunboat policy of the past has definitely gone forever. In the war of aggression against Egypt, the Anglo-French aggressors dispatched 160,000 ground troops, more than 100 warships, and more than 2,000 aircraft sorties. They originally wanted to eliminate the Egyptian army in one fell swoop, occupy the Suez Canal, overthrow the Egyptian government, and restore their colonial rule in Egypt, the Middle East, and North Africa. However, the heroic fighting of the Egyptian people dealt them a heavy blow and shattered their plan of armed aggression. The Egyptian people used their blood to write a glorious page in the history of Egypt's struggle for independence and safeguarding sovereignty. During the Anglo-French occupation of Port Said, all the residents of Port Said, regardless of the brutal suppression by the Anglo-French aggressors, fought unyieldingly against the aggressors, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Egyptian people in resisting colonialism and safeguarding independence and sovereignty.
    The Egyptian people's heroic struggle to defend national independence and sovereignty has received full support from all countries and people in the world who oppose colonialism and love peace. The Arab countries in the Middle East and North Africa share the same interests as the Egyptian people; they have always stood in solidarity with the Egyptian people and fought against the Anglo-French aggressors during the most tense moments of the Egyptian people's anti-aggression war. Under the light of the Bandung spirit, the Asian and African countries have consistently provided strong support to the Egyptian people, and they have inflicted severe blows on the aggressors morally. The struggle of the people in Britain and France against the aggression against Egypt was also a great support to the Egyptian people. In particular, the Soviet Union, as a bastion of world peace, played an extremely important role in preventing the Anglo-French aggressors from expanding the war in the Middle East and finally forcing the Anglo-French aggressors to withdraw from Egypt, with its serious warnings to the Anglo-French and Israeli aggressors. The Egyptian people have received the support of people all over the world because they are waging a just war. When an awakened nation rises up to defend its sovereignty and independence and wages a just struggle, its friends will be all over the world, and it will become invincible.
    The victory of the Egyptian people in the war against Anglo-French aggression will have a huge and far-reaching impact in every corner of Asia, Africa, and the world. It will not only further strengthen the Egyptian people's confidence and determination in winning the struggle to safeguard the sovereignty of the Suez Canal and defend national independence, but also encourage the courage of all countries and people who are striving for national independence and freedom to fight, making them realize that colonialist forces can be completely defeated. The victory of the Egyptian people will also encourage the peace-loving people of the world to fight with more confidence to defend world peace. The struggle of the Egyptian people against foreign aggressors, supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world, is actually a struggle between world peace forces and war forces. This struggle has now ended with the victory of the peace forces and the defeat of the war forces. The outcome of this struggle fully proves that, in the world today, the peace forces are already greater than the war forces. It is very obvious that the victory of the Egyptian people and the shameful defeat of the Anglo-French aggressors in the war will make it more difficult to implement the imperialist war plan.
    However, the withdrawal of Anglo-French invading forces from Egyptian territory does not mean that they have abandoned their aggressive ambitions towards Egypt and the Middle Eastern countries. The Anglo-French aggressors want to leave their naval salvage fleets in the Suez Canal area, and want to use the United Nations forces to cover up their infringement of Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal. This conspiracy of Britain and France has received the support of the United States. The United States, Britain, and France are still trying to force Egypt to accept "international co-management" of the Suez Canal. The United States, Britain, and France are also trying to keep the United Nations forces in the Suez Canal area after the Anglo-French invading forces withdraw from Port Said, as a tool for them to oppress Egypt and interfere with Egypt's exercise of sovereignty over the Suez Canal. News has it that part of the invading forces that Britain and France withdrew from Port Said have already landed in Israel and will be stationed in Israel for a long time. At the same time, the Israeli invading forces are still delaying their withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula and publicly claiming that they are unwilling to withdraw from the Gaza Strip. And the American colonialists have further exposed their ambition to control the entire Middle East. Therefore, although the Anglo-French invading forces have withdrawn from Egyptian territory, the Egyptian people's struggle to safeguard sovereignty and oppose aggression is still not over.
    We must be vigilant against the new conspiracies of the British, French, and Israeli aggressors, and we must guard against the United States' sinister activities in Egypt and the Middle East. All peace-loving countries and people should continue to support the just struggle of the Egyptian people and the people of Arab countries, so that the colonialists' conspiracies and tricks cannot succeed, and that peace in the Middle East can be fully restored and consolidated at an early date.

### 为埃及人民的胜利欢呼

    为埃及人民的胜利欢呼
    垂头丧气的英法侵略军，在22日的暮色苍茫中已经全部从埃及的领土上撤走了。英雄的塞得港和塞得港居民在经历了四十几天黑暗的日子之后，回到了自己祖国的怀抱。英法侵略军从埃及全部撤出和塞得港的光复，是埃及人民英勇反抗侵略、保卫民族独立和主权的伟大胜利，是世界一切被压迫民族反对西方殖民主义的伟大胜利，也是世界和平力量反对战争势力的伟大胜利！现在，塞得港居民和全埃及人民正在为自己的胜利而兴高采烈，全世界正义人类也在为这个胜利而欢欣鼓舞！
    英法侵略者在进攻埃及的战争中，没有捞到任何东西，不得不被迫从埃及领土上全部撤退。这证明它们的武装侵略政策已经彻底破产，证明殖民主义者企图用过去的炮舰政策来镇压各国民族独立运动的时代，肯定地是一去不复返了。英法侵略者在进攻埃及的战争中，出动了十六万陆军，一百多艘军舰，二千多架次飞机。它们原想一举消灭埃及的军队，占领苏伊士运河，推翻埃及政府，恢复它们在埃及、中东和北非的殖民统治。但是，埃及人民的英勇战斗，给了它们以沉重的打击，粉碎了它们的这个武装侵略计划。埃及人民用自己的鲜血，在埃及争取独立和维护主权的斗争史上写下了光辉的篇页。在英法侵占塞得港期间，全体塞得港居民不顾英法侵略者的残暴镇压，始终不屈地同侵略者展开斗争，显示了埃及人民这种反抗殖民主义、维护独立主权的英雄气概。
    埃及人民保卫民族独立和主权的英勇斗争，得到了全世界反对殖民主义，爱好和平的国家和人民的充分支持。中东和北非各阿拉伯国家，同埃及人民利害与共；它们在埃及人民反侵略战争最紧张的时候，始终同埃及人民团结在一起向英法侵略者进行斗争。亚非国家在万隆精神的照耀下，一直对埃及人民予以有力的支持，它们在道义上给了侵略者严重的打击。英法国内人民反对侵略埃及的斗争，对埃及人民也是很大的支援。特别是作为世界和平堡垒的苏联，它对英法和以色列侵略者的严重警告，对于制止英法侵略者在中东扩大战争，最后使英法侵略者不得不从埃及撤退，起了极其重要的作用。埃及人民得到全世界人民的支持，是因为它所进行的是正义的战争。当一个觉醒了的民族奋起保卫自己的主权和独立而进行正义斗争的时候，它的朋友将遍于全世界，它就成为不可被战胜的。
    埃及人民反抗英法侵略战争的胜利，在亚非地区和全世界的每个角落里，都将产生巨大而深远的影响。它不但将更加坚定埃及人民在维护苏伊士运河主权和保卫民族独立斗争中的胜利信心和决心，也将鼓舞一切正在争取民族独立自由的国家和人民的斗争勇气，使他们认识殖民主义势力是完全可以打败的。埃及人民的胜利，同样将鼓舞世界爱好和平人民更充满信心地为保卫世界和平而斗争。得到全世界爱好和平国家和人民支持的埃及人民所进行的反抗外国侵略者的斗争，实际上也是世界和平力量和战争势力之间的斗争。这个斗争现在已以和平力量的胜利和战争势力的失败而告终。这个斗争的结果充分证明，在今天全世界范围内，和平力量已经大过于战争势力。十分明显，埃及人民的胜利和英法侵略者在战争中的可耻失败，将使帝国主义的战争计划更难推行。
    但是，英法侵略军队撤出埃及的领土，并不表示它们已经放弃了对埃及和中东国家的侵略野心。英法侵略者要把它们的海军打捞船队留在苏伊士运河地区，想利用联合国部队来掩护它们侵犯埃及对苏伊士运河的主权。英法的这个阴谋，得到了美国的支持。美英法三国仍企图强迫埃及接受“国际共管”苏伊士运河。美英法还在设法要把联合国部队在英法侵略军撤出塞得港之后，继续留在苏伊士运河地区，作为它们压迫埃及和干涉埃及对苏伊士运河行使主权的工具。有消息说，英法从塞得港撤退的一部分侵略军，已经在以色列登陆，将长期驻扎在以色列。同时，以色列侵略军还在拖延从西奈半岛撤退，并公开声称不愿撤出加沙地区。而美国殖民者也已经进一步暴露了自己企图控制整个中东的野心。因此，英法侵略军队虽然已经撤出了埃及领土，但是埃及人民维护主权和反对侵略的斗争，仍然没有结束。
    必须警惕英法和以色列侵略者的新的阴谋，必须提防美国在埃及和中东地区所作的居心叵测的活动。一切爱好和平的国家和人民，都应该继续支援埃及人民和阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争，使殖民主义者的阴谋诡计不能得逞，使中东地区的和平能够早日完全恢复并得到巩固。
