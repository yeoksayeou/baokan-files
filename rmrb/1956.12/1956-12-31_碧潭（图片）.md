    Bitan (Traditional Chinese Painting)
　　Lin Guanming
    Bitan is located in the northern part of Taiwan Province, 12 kilometers from Taipei. A suspension bridge spans the pool. Crossing the bridge and climbing the mountain, one can overlook the emerald green water of the pool. Under the cliffs, it is dozens of fathoms deep, and the water flows rapidly, but small boats can still navigate, and swimming is also possible. Surrounded by mountains on three sides, the area is often shrouded in dense fog during windy and rainy weather, and when the weather clears, a fresh green color spreads across the mountains, both of which are full of wonderful interest.

    碧潭（国画）
　　林冠明
    碧潭在台湾省北部，距台北十二公里。潭中横跨一吊桥，过桥登山，俯瞰碧绿的潭水，在峭壁下深数十丈，水流湍急，但仍可泛小舟，亦可游泳。这里三面环山，风雨时遍山浓雾，放晴时新绿一片，都有奇趣。
