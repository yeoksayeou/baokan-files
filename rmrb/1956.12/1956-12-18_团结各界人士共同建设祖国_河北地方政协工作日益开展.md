Xinhua News Agency report:

    Hebei's county (city) People's Political Consultative organizations and work have greatly developed over the past year, reflecting the expanding and strengthening of the people's democratic united front. This year, the number of CPPCC members in Shulu County increased from 43 last year to 80; in the mountainous Wei County, it increased from 33 last year to 51. Tongzhou City and Jinghai County have both held 11 CPPCC Standing Committee meetings within this year, promptly consulting on the various specific measures for implementing national policies and laws locally and various issues within the conference.

    Due to the strengthening of consultative work in various places, the understanding of national policies and laws has been improved, and the unity with all parties has been strengthened. Many CPPCC members have played an active role in promoting the implementation of national policies, laws, and various tasks. For example, the CPPCC members in Ci County have twice organized慰问团 (comfort groups) to the flood-stricken areas to offer condolences and helped arrange production and disaster relief work.

    In terms of organizing and promoting learning among people from all walks of life, according to statistics from ten counties including Shulu and Nangong, the CPPCC has organized more than 4,400 people from all walks of life to participate in learning. Many counties have integrated the specific measures for implementing national policies and laws in their localities into the organization of learning. Wu'an County also organized participants to visit the achievements of socialist construction in various parts of the county. In learning, the principles of freedom, consciousness, and voluntariness were generally implemented, so the enthusiasm for learning was very high. Many people wrote study notes and learning experiences and expressed their willingness to contribute to the cause of socialist construction.

    In terms of contact with all parties, a lot of work has also been done. Various places generally adopted methods of sending letters to solicit opinions, visiting, and inviting people to forums to make contact. According to statistics from eight counties including Wei County and Daming, 760 letters from members and the people have been received in the past year. In addition to reflecting the implementation of national policies and laws and related issues, these letters also put forward many constructive suggestions. Due to the strengthening of social liaison work, some prominent social figures who were unwilling to participate in social work in the past have recently requested to contribute to the country's construction cause.

    团结各界人士共同建设祖国  河北地方政协工作日益开展
    新华社讯　河北各县（市）人民政治协商组织和工作一年来有了很大发展，体现了人民民主统一战线日益扩大和加强。今年，束鹿县的政协委员人数由去年的四十三人增加到八十人；山区的蔚县由去年的三十三人增加到五十一人。通州市和静海县今年一年内都召开过十一次政协常务委员会议，及时协商了当地执行国家政策法令的各项具体措施和会内各项问题。
    由于各地加强协商工作，提高了对国家政策法令的认识，加强了和各方面的团结，很多政协委员在协助国家贯彻执行政策法令和各项任务方面起了积极的推动作用。如磁县的政协委员就曾经两次组织慰问团到水灾地区慰问，并且帮助安排生产救灾工作。
    在组织和推动各界人士学习方面，据束鹿、南宫等十个县的统计，政协共组织了四千四百多个各界人士参加学习。许多县在组织学习中结合了当地贯彻国家政策法令的各项具体措施。武安县还组织参加学习的人员到本县各地参观社会主义建设事业的成就。在学习中，一般都贯彻了自由、自觉和自愿的原则，因而学习情绪很高，很多人写了学习笔记、学习心得，并且表示愿为社会主义建设事业贡献力量。
    在同各方面联系上，也作了不少工作。各地一般都采用发信征求意见、下去访问、邀请来座谈等联系的方法。据蔚县、大名等八个县的统计，一年来收到委员和人民群众的来信有七百六十件。这些来信除了反映对国家政策法令贯彻执行的情况和问题以外，还提出了许多建设性的意见。由于加强了社会联系工作，有些有名望的社会人士，过去不愿参加社会工作，近来也要求为国家建设事业贡献力量了。
