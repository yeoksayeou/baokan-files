　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 13th: According to TASS, the United Nations General Assembly passed a recommendation from the Trusteeship Council at its morning meeting on the 13th to end the trusteeship status of Togoland, which is currently administered by Britain. The recommendation stipulates that after the British colony of Gold Coast, which Britain has already promised to grant independence to in March 1957, gains independence, Togoland will be incorporated into the Gold Coast. The name of this new country will be called Ghana.

　　Representatives from many countries hoped that this new country would achieve genuine autonomy and independence in terms of political, economic, and cultural development.

　　Soviet Representative Sobolev pointed out that the Soviet Union has always advocated the unification of the Togolese people and the granting of independence to Togoland as quickly as possible. However, since the restoration of unification between the two parts of Togoland (the other part of Togoland is under French administration) has become impossible at this stage due to the insistence of the administering authorities, the Soviet delegation supports the proposal to incorporate the part of Togoland currently administered by Britain into the Gold Coast.

　　(Editor's Note) Togoland is located in West Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea to the south, French West Africa to the northeast, and the Gold Coast to the west. The total area is 87,200 square kilometers. The eastern part is a French trust territory, and the western part is a British trust territory. The total population is over 1.4 million. The main products are cocoa, coconut, coffee, cotton, tobacco, etc. Togoland was occupied by Germany around 1884. At the beginning of World War I, it was occupied by Britain and France. In 1920, the former League of Nations divided it between Britain and France for trusteeship. In 1946, the United Nations Trusteeship Council decided that Togoland would continue to be held in trust by Britain and France.

    联大决议结束对多哥的托管
    多哥将与黄金海岸合并成立新国家
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社纽约13日讯：联合国大会13日上午会议通过了托管委员会提出的结束目前由英国管理的多哥的托管地位的建议。这个建议规定，在英国已经允诺在1957年3月给予独立的英国殖民地黄金海岸获得独立以后，多哥将并入黄金海岸，这个新的国家的名称将叫敌加纳。
    许多国家的代表希望这个新的国家在政治、经济和文化发展方面能够获得真正的自主和独立。
    苏联代表索波列夫指出，苏联始终主张多哥各民族统一和尽速给予多哥独立。但是，既然由于各管理当局坚持反对，在现阶段多哥的两部分（多哥的另一部分在法国的管理之下）的恢复统一成为不可能，苏联代表团支持把目前由英国管理的多哥那部分并入黄金海岸的建议。
    （编者注）多哥位于非洲西部，南滨几内亚湾，东北与法属西非洲相连，西接黄金海岸。全境面积八万七千二百平方公里。东部为法国托管区，西部为英国托管区。人口共一百四十多万。主要物产有可可、椰子、咖啡、棉花、烟草等。多哥于1884年间被德国所占。第一次世界大战初期，又被英法占领。1920年，前国际联盟分交英法两国托管。1946年，联合国托管理事会决定多哥继续保持由英法托管的地位。
