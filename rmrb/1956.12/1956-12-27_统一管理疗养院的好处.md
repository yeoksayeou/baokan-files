    The Benefits of Unified Management of Sanatoriums
    In recent years, the Henan Provincial Department of Commerce, the Grain Department, and the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions have built several sanatoriums (or institutes) in the cultural district east of Zhengzhou City. Due to a lack of unified leadership and management, the utilization rate of the equipment in these sanatoriums is not high. For example, the Department of Commerce sanatorium has hardly accommodated any patients in the past two years, and the Grain Department sanatorium has one hundred and fifty beds, but only three or four are regularly used. The X-ray machine at the Provincial Workers' Sanatorium could be used by several sanatoriums, but other units cannot use it. Other facilities, such as the bathhouses, sulfur bathhouses, and washing machines in the sanatoriums, are also used inefficiently. In terms of organizational structure, each sanatorium has an admissions office, laboratory, pharmacy, and physiotherapy room. Due to the small workload, most of the management personnel have nothing to do.
    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently consulted with relevant departments, and have now basically merged the sanatoriums into one unit, concentrated the use of various equipment, and implemented unified leadership. Now, the turnover rate of beds has increased, and patients can be treated in different zones according to their condition. Doctors can also concentrate their efforts on studying and treating similar conditions. Currently, there are three hundred people receiving treatment in the sanatorium. Ma Xingpu Zhao Mingqing

    统一管理疗养院的好处
    近几年来，河南省商业厅、粮食厅、省工会联合会等单位在郑州市文化区的东边，建筑了好几个疗养院（所）。这些疗养院由于缺乏统一领导和管理，设备的使用率不高。例如商业厅疗养院两年来几乎没有收容过疗养员，粮食厅疗养院有一百五十张床位，而经常使用的只有三、四张。省工人疗养院的爱克斯光机，可供这几个疗养院使用，但别的单位不能使用。其它如各疗养院的浴池、硫磺浴池、洗衣机等，使用效率也低。在组织机构方面，各个疗养院都设有住院处、化验室、药房、理疗室等，由于工作量小，管理人员大多无事可做。
    中共河南省委和全国总工会最近同有关部门进行了协商，现在基本上已把疗养院合并为一个单位，集中使用各种设备，实行了统一领导。现在，病床的周转率提高了，疗养病人可以按病情分区疗养。医生也可以根据同类病情集中力量研究治疗。现有三百人在疗养院里疗养。　马兴普　赵名清
