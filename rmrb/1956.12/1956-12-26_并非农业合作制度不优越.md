    It Is Not That the Agricultural Cooperative System Is Not Superior
    Lin Wei

    The Guangxi Daily reported: It is said that a young farmer in Yongning County, because of the poor harvest this year, is very disheartened with the agricultural cooperative, and even unwilling to hear others talk about the superiority of agricultural cooperatives.

    This young man's ideological understanding is worth discussing.

    Is cooperative production really a superior system? In China, this is indeed no longer a theoretical question, but a practical question that can be answered with facts. Therefore, I very much agree with the Guangxi Daily's opinion in its editorial on this matter: "Let the facts themselves educate people."

    The Guangxi Daily has already cited many facts from various places in Guangxi. Here I would also like to cite some facts from Shandong Province and Henan Province.

    Since last year, the agricultural production of Shandong and Henan provinces, like other provinces, has been rapidly and comprehensively cooperativized. In Henan Province, 99.4% of farm households have joined agricultural cooperatives, of which 98.1% have joined advanced cooperatives. According to statistics at the end of June this year in Shandong Province, the number of farmers joining cooperatives has reached 93.3% of the total number of farm households, and those joining advanced cooperatives have reached 65% of the total number of farm households.

    What has agricultural cooperativization, especially the cooperativization of a completely socialist nature, brought to people in its first year? Of course, with the limited materials I obtained during a short visit, I cannot comprehensively and systematically answer such a question. But one thing is certain, that many good things that were unimaginable in the era of private land ownership and individual management have appeared. This is especially evident in the high-speed progress of basic farmland water conservancy construction.

    Before liberation, Henan Province had a total of seven million mu of irrigated land (this is the accumulation of labor of many generations of farmers!). After liberation, water conservancy projects were actively developed, and by last year, another seven million mu had been added (this speed is already unprecedented in Chinese history!). However, in just one year after the comprehensive cooperativization, the farmers, in an organized manner, dug canals, sank wells, built ponds, and constructed reservoirs in large numbers, resulting in an increase of 36 million mu of irrigated land. This number is more than 2.5 times the total historical accumulation before last year! Henan Province has a total of 130 million mu of cultivated land, and now almost 40% has become irrigated land. In Shandong Province, agricultural cooperatives in various places, through one year of efforts, have seen irrigated land increase sharply from 8 million mu to 37 million mu, an increase of more than 3.5 times the original amount. Isn't this a miracle!

    The increase in irrigated land is only one aspect. On the other hand, the basic construction of farmland water conservancy has also reduced the harm of floods. Guo Lei Township in Huixian County, Henan Province, was prone to floods every year due to its low-lying terrain. This year, 58 drainage ditches, ranging from one or two li to four or five li in length, were built, and all of the more than 6,000 mu of low-lying land was transformed into fertile fields. Last year, the farmers here were short of 200,000 jin of grain and had to buy it from the state. This year, they not only did not lack grain, but also sold 200,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Agricultural cooperative members in Shanggao Township, Taian County, Shandong Province, dug a large drainage ditch this year, which can both drain water and prevent flooding, and also store water to prevent drought. In the past, 2,400 mu of land in this township suffered reduced yields every year due to drought and flood, causing great suffering to many farmers. Now, with the ditch, it is guaranteed to increase grain production by more than 100,000 jin per year. Such examples can be cited in large numbers.

    Some may ask: Are these achievements necessarily due to the cooperative production system? Or, "Can farmland water conservancy be built without agricultural cooperatives?" My answer is: Of course, a little bit can be built without agricultural cooperatives, but the difficulties will be much greater and the progress will be much slower. First, due to private land ownership, the land occupation problem for basic construction is difficult to solve. Last year, someone in the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Guangrao County, Shandong Province, planned to dig a few small ditches to solve the drinking water problem, and the farmers also said that the plan was good. However, it could not be done. No one wanted to have their land dug. This problem was not solved until it was transformed into an advanced cooperative. Now, this cooperative has not only dug small ditches, but also dug large ditches that can irrigate more than 10,000 mu. Second, without cooperatives, farmers have to take care of their small plots of land frequently, and cannot uniformly deploy and use manpower on a large scale, and it is difficult to concentrate such a large amount of manpower to do a large project. Moreover, due to the scattered land locations of each farm household and different interests, it is difficult to expect everyone to be equally enthusiastic and active. In the past, many places failed to build water conservancy projects, which was very closely related to this situation.

    The benefits brought by agricultural production cooperativization are of course not only in the construction of farmland water conservancy. The large-scale connection of land also creates good conditions for cultivation and irrigation, and also expands the cultivated area. In the past, the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Guangrao County, Shandong Province, could only cultivate about 3,000 mu by machine because of the small land plots, many field ridges, and uneven terrain. This year, after the realization of advanced cooperativization, the cultivated land has been connected into large blocks of hundreds or even thousands of mu, and the machine-cultivated land has increased to more than 10,000 mu. In the past, the largest plot of the Xianfeng Cooperative in Bin County was 40 mu, but now it has reached 600 mu. In the past, only 1,400 mu could be cultivated by machine, but now more than 6,000 mu can be cultivated by machine. According to statistics from Kaicheng Village in Licheng County, simply reducing the field ridges and reclaiming the field edges has expanded the cultivated area by more than 1,500 mu, which can produce more than 520,000 jin of grain each year. The original cultivated land of the Guangwu First Cooperative in Henan Province had 5,287 plots, but now it has been merged into 728 plots. In addition to saving labor, it has also expanded the cultivated land by 230 mu. In the past, 1,480 mu of land in this cooperative was more than two li away, but now, due to the abolition of private land ownership, the close land that was staggered with other cooperatives has been exchanged smoothly, and only 20 mu of land is more than two li away. Calculating this item alone can save 3,500 workdays.

    The superiority of various aspects, such as planting according to local conditions, using talents according to their abilities, and facilitating the promotion of new technologies and new experiences, which have already been demonstrated in the primary cooperative stage, need not be listed one by one here.

    Because of these, production has generally increased in areas without disasters this year. According to statistics from 1,327 cooperatives in three non-disaster counties, Guangshan, etc., in Xinyang area, Henan Province, 1,145 cooperatives (accounting for 86%) can guarantee that the income of more than 90% of the members will increase. According to statistics from 219 disaster-stricken cooperatives in Xinxiang area, 50 cooperatives (accounting for 22%) can also guarantee that the income of more than 90% of the members will increase. According to statistics from Taian County, Shandong Province, in October, 627 cooperatives (accounting for 59% of the total) can guarantee that the income of more than 90% of the members will increase. Another 263 cooperatives (accounting for 25% of the total) can guarantee that the income of more than 80% of the members will increase.

    I have written so much, not to cover up shortcomings or embellish reality. I do not deny the fact that a small number of agricultural cooperatives have reduced production this year. In the above-mentioned Taian County, there are 41 cooperatives (accounting for 3.8% of the total) that have reduced production. I also do not deny that in addition to the reduction in production due to natural disasters, there are also reasons for management (i.e., leadership). However, leadership issues cannot be confused with system issues, because leadership and management can be improved. When I visited Huqiao Township in Huixian County, Henan Province, several cooperative members told me that when they first transformed into advanced cooperatives, the division of labor was not good, the scoring was not good, the labor organization was not good, and the whole cooperative was very chaotic, especially the phenomenon of idling, which was very serious. However, after the cooperative cadres and comrades from higher levels repeatedly studied and improved, the phenomenon of idling gradually decreased, and the order of labor gradually normalized. Later, through good organization and leadership, all the irrigated land in the cooperative was ridged, which greatly improved the effect of irrigation; good results were also achieved in terms of fertilizer accumulation; in addition, appropriate close planting and other yield-increasing measures were taken, and this year finally achieved an increase of 41%. Now, the farmers in this township, except for a few people who have some opinions on the distribution issue, everyone recognizes the superiority of the cooperative production system itself. Everyone said: "If there were no floods, the increase in production this year would be much greater than it is now." Farmers with more labor are even more happy, and they say, "Now there is no more energy!"

    Under the same conditions of suffering from floods, some cooperatives led well and organized drainage and replanting activities in a timely manner, and as a result, production was not reduced, or even increased; some cooperatives did not have anyone to lead the drainage and replanting well, and as a result, production was reduced. Such examples are everywhere. Therefore, from the fact that some agricultural cooperatives have reduced production, we can only draw the conclusion that "concrete leadership should be universally strengthened," and not the conclusion that "the cooperative system is not superior."

    The cause of agricultural cooperativization is a cause that our ancestors have never done before. This cause, for Communists, is still a new cause without sufficient experience, just like for the peasant masses. Since it is a new cause, it is impossible to hope that there will be no such and such errors and shortcomings, unless we do nothing. But we cannot do nothing. If we do nothing, farmers will never have any hope of getting rid of poverty. If we want to do it, we must adopt a calm attitude towards the shortcomings and errors that occur in the middle of doing it: calmly clarify the nature of these shortcomings and errors, clarify the reasons for their occurrence, and study ways to overcome them. We should believe that as long as this new system is good, reasonable, and can promote the development of social productive forces, this system must contain the possibility of overcoming all difficulties, and it will definitely survive, develop, and finally defeat the old system. The current thing we should do is to make the greatest and best efforts to improve leadership in all aspects (the peasant masses should also actively help the cooperative cadres to improve leadership), actively remove obstacles and pave the way for this new system, so that its superiority can be maximized.

    并非农业合作制度不优越
    林韦
    广西日报载：据说邕宁县有一位青年农民，因为今年收成不好，对农业社非常灰心，甚至不愿听别人再谈农业社的优越性了。
    这个青年的思想认识上的问题是很值得谈谈的。
    合作化的生产究竟是不是一种优越的制度呢？在我国说来，这的确已经不是一个理论的问题，而是完全可以用实事来答复的实际问题了。所以我很同意广西日报在为此事所发的社论中提到的意见：“让事实本身去教育人们。”
    广西日报已经举出了广西各地的许多事实，这里我还想再举出一些山东省和河南省的事实。
    去年以来，山东、河南两省的农业生产也像其他省份一样，迅速地全面地合作化了。河南省参加农业合作社的农户达到总农户的99.4％，其中参加高级社的占总农户的98.1％。山东省今年6月底统计，入社农民已经达到总农户的93.3％，加入高级社的达到总农户的65％。
    农业合作化，尤其是完全社会主义性质的合作化，最初一年究竟给人们带来了什么？仅凭我在短短的访问期间所得到的很少的材料，当然不能全面地系统地回答这样的问题。但有一点可以肯定的，就是有许多在土地私有和个体经营时代所不能想像的好事情出现了。这从农田水利基本建设的高速度进展上看得特别明白。
    河南省在解放以前，一共有七百万亩水浇地（这是多少世代农民劳动的积累啊！）；解放以后积极发展水利事业，到去年为止，又增加了七百万亩（这速度在中国历史上已经是空前的了！）。可是，全面合作化以后仅仅一年，农民们有组织地大量开渠，打井，修塘，修水库的结果，水浇地就增加了三千六百万亩。这个数目等于去年以前全部历史积累的两倍半还多！河南全省耕地一亿三千万亩，现在几乎40％成了水浇地。山东各地的农业合作社，经过一年来的努力，水浇地由八百万亩激增至三千七百万亩，增加数等于原数的三倍半还多。这难道不是奇迹么！
    水浇地的增加只是一个方面。另一方面，农田水利的基本建设还减轻了水灾的危害。河南辉县郭垒乡因地势低洼，过去年年遭水灾。今年一下修了五十八条一、二里至四、五里长的排水沟，六千多亩洼地全部变成了肥田。去年这里的农民缺粮二十万斤，要从国家买；今年不但不缺粮，还卖了二十万斤余粮给国家。山东泰安县上高乡农业社员们今年挖的大水沟，既能排水防涝，也能蓄水防旱。这个乡有二千四百亩地过去年年都因旱涝减产，造成许多农民的痛苦；现在有了水沟，可以保证一年增产粮食十多万斤。这样的例子，可以举出许许多多。
    有人也许会问：这些成就是不是一定要归功于合作生产这个制度呢？或者说：“没有农业合作社是不是也能兴修农田水利呢？我的回答是：没有农业合作社当然也能兴修一点，不过困难不知要大多少，进度不知要慢多少。第一，由于土地私有，基本建设占地问题是很难解决的。山东广饶县的五星农业社，去年就有人计划挖几条小水沟解决吃水问题，农民也说这计划不错。可是，办不到。挖着谁的地，谁也不愿意。一直到转成高级社，这问题才解决。现在这个社不仅挖了小水沟，还挖了可以灌溉万亩以上的大水沟。第二，没有合作社，农民都要经常照顾自己的小片土地，不能在大范围内统一调配和使用人力，统一分工，要想集中这样大的人力来做一个大工程，是很难办到的。而且，由于各农户的土地位置分散，利害不同，也很难希望大家同样热心、积极。从前有许多地方要修水利修不成，同这种情况有非常密切的关系。
    农业生产合作化带来的好处，当然不只是在农田水利的建设方面。土地的大量连片，还给耕作和灌溉创造了良好的条件，同时也扩大了耕地面积。山东广饶县五星农业社过去因为地块小、地头地埂多，崎岖不平，只能机耕三千亩左右。今年实现高级合作化以后，耕地都连成了几百亩以至上千亩的大块，机耕地增加到一万多亩。滨县先锋社过去最大片是四十亩，现在达到六百亩。过去只能机耕一千四百亩，现在能机耕六千多亩。历城县开城村统计，仅仅减少地埝，开垦地边，就扩大耕地面积一千五百多亩，每年可多收粮食五十二万多斤，河南广武第一社耕地原有五千二百八十七块，现在并成了七百二十八块，除节省劳力外，还扩大耕地二百三十亩。过去这个社有一千四百八十亩地是二里多路的远地，现在由于土地私有制取消，顺利地同别的社交换了交错的近地，二里以外的地只剩二十亩了。仅以这一项计算，可以节省三千五百个工。
    在初级社时期已经显示出来的因地种植，因才使用，便于推广新技术新经验等各方面的优越性，这里不必一一列举了。
    由于这些，无灾地区今年普遍增产。河南信阳地区光山等三个非灾县一千三百二十七个社统计，有一千一百四十五个社（占86％）可以保证十分之九以上社员收入增加。新乡地区二百一十九个受灾社统计，也有五十个社（占22％）能保证十分之九以上社员收入增加。山东泰安县十月份统计，有六百二十七个社（占总数59％）能保证十分之九以上社员收入增加。另有二百六十三个社（占总数25％）能保证十分之八以上社员收入增加。
    我写了这许多，并不是想掩盖缺点，粉饰现实。我不否认今年有一小部分农业合作社减产的事实，上述泰安县就有四十一个社（占总数3.8％减产）。我也不否认除了因自然灾害而减产还有经营管理上（即领导上）的原因。但是，领导上的问题并不能和制度问题相混淆，因为领导和经营管理是可以改善的。我在河南辉县胡桥乡访问的时候，好几个社员告诉我：在刚转成高级社的时候，分工分不好，记分记不好，劳动组织不好，全社都很乱，尤其是窝工现象，非常严重。可是以后经过社干部和上级来的同志多次研究、改进，窝工现象就逐渐减少了，劳动的秩序也逐渐正常了。以后经过很好的组织领导，全社所有的水浇地都打了畦，使浇水的效果大大提高；积肥方面也取得很好的成绩；再加上适当的密植和其他增产措施，今年终于争取到增产41％的成果。现在这个乡的农民除了少数人对分配问题有些意见外，对合作生产这个制度本身的优越性是大家都承认的。大家都说：“要是没有水灾，今年增产比现在多得多。”劳力多的农户，更是非常高兴，一说话就是“现在再得劲没有了！”
    在同样遭受水灾的条件下，有的社领导得好，及时组织了排水和补种等活动，结果就不减产，甚至增产；有的社没有人好好领导排水补种，结果就减了产。这样的例子到处都是。所以，从若干农业社减产的事实中只能得出“应当普遍加强具体领导”的结论，不能得出“合作社制度不优越”的结论。
    农业合作化的事业，是我们的祖先从来没有做过的事业。这个事业，对于共产党人来说，也同对于农民群众一样，都还是没有充足经验的新事业。既然是新事业，希望不发生这样那样的错误和缺点是不可能的，除非不做。但我们是不能不做的。不做，农民就永远没有希望摆脱贫困。要做，就要对做的中间所发生的缺点和错误采取冷静的态度：冷静地弄清这些缺点和错误的性质，弄清它们发生的原因，研究克服的办法。应当相信：只要这种新的制度是好的，合理的，能促进社会生产力发展的，这种制度就一定包含着克服一切困难的可能，一定会生存，发展，最后战胜旧的制度。当前我们应该做的事情是尽最大的和最善的努力，从各方面改进领导（农民群众也应当积极地帮助办社干部改进领导），积极地为这种新制度扫除障碍，开辟道路，使它的优越性能最大限度地发挥出来。
