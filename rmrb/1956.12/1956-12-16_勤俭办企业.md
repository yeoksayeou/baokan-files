In the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party, Comrade Mao Zedong called on all state personnel and economic personnel, especially responsible personnel in all fields, to promote a style of hard work and plain living, to share weal and woe with the masses, and to oppose extravagance and waste. The Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party also decided to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy among the whole Party and the people of the whole country. Now, many enterprises have taken action, and many enterprise workers are talking about running enterprises through thrift and hard work, and some units have also convened employee representative meetings. This is a very good trend. Party organizations in various departments and localities should pay attention to supporting this trend in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, so that enterprises can create more wealth and accumulate more funds.

We cannot say that current enterprises are all run extravagantly and luxuriously. Through years of increasing production and practicing economy, extravagance and waste in enterprises have indeed been greatly reduced. However, it would also be untrue to think that our enterprises are all run with thrift and frugality. The money spent by enterprises can be roughly divided into two parts: one part is production expenditure, such as purchasing raw materials, adding equipment, etc.; the other part is non-production expenditure, such as adding furniture, daily administrative expenses, etc. Examining these two aspects, the money spent by enterprises is not all appropriate, and waste in some enterprises is still serious.

Recently, the trend of extravagance and waste has been growing again in some enterprises in Shanghai, which is a noteworthy example. Many "big customers" in Shanghai's high-end furniture market are sent by enterprise units. A very small iron factory, shortly after becoming a joint state-private enterprise, immediately bought beautiful desks, mahogany stools, and other expensive furniture worth more than 1,000 yuan. Some units even put forward the so-called "three don'ts" when selecting high-end furniture: don't want sofas unless they are made of leather, don't want furniture unless it is made of mahogany or teak, and don't want desks unless they are made of steel. This trend of extravagance and waste is not only happening in Shanghai, but also some enterprises in Beijing and other places have shown signs of relapse. There are still many examples of grand ceremonies for starting construction and lavish banquets for meetings.

Perhaps some people will say: "These are all non-production expenditures, which don't cost much money, and don't amount to anything." In fact, that is not the case. Seen in isolation, each of these expenditures may be limited, but added together, it is a considerable figure. Moreover, the harm of this trend of extravagance and waste to us cannot be expressed by the figures of economic losses. If extravagance and waste are not stopped in time, it can easily develop into a serious detachment from the masses. When the living standards of our vast people are not yet high, when our workers are willing to endure certain difficulties in life in order to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country, but we run enterprises extravagantly and spend a lot of money on unnecessary things, the masses will definitely be dissatisfied with us. Does this also "not amount to anything"?

Waste in production expenditures in enterprises is more common than waste in non-production expenditures. Economically speaking, the amount of waste in production expenditures is much larger. Many leaders of our enterprises like to "the more the better" in material preparation. According to statistics, the materials currently stockpiled in Shenyang are worth more than 40 million yuan, of which long-term stockpiled materials are worth more than 30 million yuan. Of course, there are many reasons for the stockpiling, but the fact that many enterprises like to have more materials on hand, "better safe than sorry," is also an important reason. In addition, there is the use of high-quality materials for inferior purposes, the use of large materials for small purposes; the pursuit of mechanization and automation in equipment, neglecting the maintenance and repair of existing equipment, and relaxing the exploration of the potential of existing equipment; in the trial production of new products, regardless of actual needs, emphasizing that new products require new factories and new equipment. These wasteful styles exist in some enterprises.

Perhaps some people will say: "If production expenditures are tightened too much, it will affect production." Yes, production expenditures are essential for enterprise production. However, it is still possible to avoid waste in this part of the enterprise's essential expenditures. For example, raw materials need to have a certain reserve, and without reserves, production will stop and wait for materials, causing great losses. However, reserves must have a certain limit. Too many, too early, or even wrong reserves will not only not be beneficial to ensuring production, but will also cause great waste.

Whether it is waste in production expenditures or waste in non-production expenditures, it is detrimental to the country and the people. "Opposing waste and practicing strict economy" is also a slogan that must be raised every year. However, waste has not been eliminated. What is the reason for this? A very important reason is that past economy work has often been regarded as a sudden, temporary campaign. "The campaign is like a gust of wind, and it is loose after it passes." Although the leaders of the enterprise led the campaign to oppose waste and practice strict economy, they did not fundamentally establish the idea of running the enterprise with thrift and hard work. After the economy targets were completed, the work was relaxed. In this way, it is of course impossible to completely eliminate extravagance and waste.

Diligence and frugality are the fine traditions of our people, and our Party has inherited and carried forward this tradition for more than 30 years. The factories led by our Party also have this tradition. Recalling the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, the material conditions were so difficult. We opened factories in caves in the mountains and in simple thatched cottages. Although it was difficult to find even the oldest belt lathe, we still produced ammunition and weapons to support the people's war. Today, the revolution has been won, and the material conditions of the factories are many times better than in the past. Why can't we sit without a leather sofa now? Why don't we actively think of ways to eliminate the phenomenon of wasting raw materials?

We do not think that the production conditions of the factories led by our Party during the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation were ideal. Those were extraordinary measures during extraordinary times, and there is no need to do that today. However, the spirit of hard work and plain living, diligence and frugality at that time, should not be abandoned at any time. Today, our enterprises shoulder a serious task: the state has handed over a large amount of funds to the enterprises, investing in production and construction, in order to build our country into an advanced socialist industrial country. Under such a major task, the leaders of the enterprise should carry forward the spirit of hard work and plain living, and do more with less money.

Of course, it is not enough for only a few enterprise leaders to establish a style of diligence and frugality. Any work cannot be done well without the supervision of the masses. Moreover, waste is often hidden in every corner of the enterprise, and the active participation of the masses is even more indispensable. There is no force in the world greater than the force of the masses. Only by educating the masses and forming a social atmosphere of practicing strict economy among the broad masses can the phenomenon of extravagance and waste be eliminated.

### 勤俭办企业

    勤俭办企业
    在党中央第二次全体会议上，毛泽东同志号召全体国家工作人员、经济工作人员，首先是各方面的负责工作人员，提倡艰苦朴素的作风，与群众同甘共苦，反对铺张浪费现象。党中央第二次全体会议还决定在全党和全国人民中发动一个增产节约运动。现在，许多企业已经行动起来，许多企业的职工都在谈论勤俭办企业，有的单位还召开了职工代表会议。这是一种很好的风气。各个部门和各地党组织在增产节约运动中应该注意扶植这种风气，让企业创造更多的财富，积累更多的资金。
    我们不能说现在的企业都办得很铺张、很奢侈。经过历年来的增产节约运动，企业中的铺张浪费现象，确实已经大大收敛了。然而，如果以为我们的企业都办得很勤俭，很节省，却也是不合事实的。企业花的钱大体可以分为两个部分：一部分是生产性的开支，如采购原材料，添置设备等等；一部分是非生产性的开支，如添置家具，日常行政费用等等。就这两方面来检查，企业中花的钱也不是都很恰当的，某些企业中的浪费还是严重的。
    最近上海有些企业的铺张浪费之风又在滋长，这就是值得注意的例子。上海上等家具市场的许多“阔顾客”都是企业单位派去的。有一个很小的铁工厂在公私合营以后不久，一下子就买了价值一千多元的漂亮的写字台、红木凳等高贵的家具。有的单位选购上等家具还提出所谓“三不要”：沙发非皮制不要，家具非红木柚木不要，办公桌非钢制不要。这种铺张浪费的风气不只发生在上海一地，北京和其它地方一些企业的铺张浪费也有故态复萌之势。开工必有大典，有会必设盛宴等例子还有不少。
    也许有人说：“这些都是非生产性的开支，花不了几个钱，算不得什么。”其实不然。孤立地看，每一笔这类开支，所费也许有限，但加在一起就是一个可观的数字。而且这种铺张浪费的风气对于我们的危害，决不是经济上受损失的数字所能表现的。铺张浪费如不及时制止，很容易发展到严重脱离群众的地步。当我们广大人民生活的水平还不高的时候，当我们的工人为了把我们的国家从落后的农业国变成先进的社会主义工业国，甘愿在生活上忍受某些困难的时候，我们却把企业办得很铺张，把许多钱花在不必要的地方，群众一定会不满意我们。这难道也“算不得什么”吗？
    企业中生产性开支的浪费，比非生产性开支的浪费，更要普遍一些。从经济上说，生产性开支中浪费的数量大得多。我们有不少企业的领导者在备料工作中喜欢“多多益善”。据统计目前沈阳市积压的材料约值四千多万元，其中长期积压的材料约有三千多万元。当然，积压的原因是多方面的，但是许多企业喜欢掌握的材料多一些，“有备无患”，也是一个重要原因。此外，在用料上优材劣用，大材小用；在设备上追求机械化、自动化，放松了对原有设备的保养和检修，放松了挖掘原有设备的潜力；在试制新产品中，不管实际需要，强调做新产品就要新厂房、新设备。这些浪费作风，在一些企业中是存在的。
    也许有人说：“生产性的开支，如果扣得太紧，会影响生产。”是的，生产性的开支是企业生产必不可少的。但是，这部分企业必不可少的开支，毕竟也不是不能避免浪费的。例如原材料需要有一定的储备，没有储备就会停工待料，造成很大的损失。但是储备必须有一定的限度，备多了、备早了、甚至备错了，对于保证生产不但没有什么好处，而且会造成很大的浪费。
    无论是生产性开支中的浪费，或者是非生产性开支中的浪费，都是对国家人民不利的。“反对浪费、厉行节约”也是年年必提的口号。然而，浪费现象并没有杜绝。这是什么原因呢？一个很重要的原因是，过去的节约工作常常被当成突击性的临时运动。“运动一阵风，过去就稀松”。企业的领导者虽然领导了反对浪费、厉行节约的运动，但是并没有从根本上树立勤俭办企业的思想，节约的指标完成了，工作也就放松了。这样，当然不可能使铺张浪费的现象完全绝迹。
    克勤克俭是我国人民的优良传统，我们的党三十多年如一日，继承和发扬了这种传统。我们的党所领导的工厂也是有这个传统的。回忆在抗日战争中，在解放战争中，物质条件是多么艰难。我们在山沟的窑洞中，在简陋的茅屋里，开设了工厂。尽管连最老式的皮带车床都很难找到，却照样生产出弹药和武器，支持了人民战争。今天，革命胜利了，工厂的物质条件比过去不知道好了多少倍。为什么现在不是皮沙发就不能坐？为什么对浪费原材料的现象不积极想法去消除？
    我们并不认为抗日战争和解放战争中，我们党所领导的那些工厂的生产条件是理想的。那是非常时期的非常措施，今天已经没有必要那样做了。但是，那时候的艰苦朴素的精神，克勤克俭的作风，却是在任何时候也不应该抛弃的。今天，我们的企业担负着一个严重的任务：国家把大量的资金交付给企业，投入生产和建设，以便把我国建设成一个先进的社会主义工业国。在这样重大的任务之下，企业的领导者就应该发扬艰苦朴素的精神，用更少的钱办更多的事。
    当然，只是少数几个企业的领导者树立了克勤克俭的作风还是不够的。任何工作离开了群众的监督都不可能办好。况且浪费现象往往隐藏在企业的每一个角落里，更非群众积极参加不可。世界上再也没有比群众的力量更巨大的了。只有教育群众，在广大群众中形成厉行节约的风尚，才能杜绝铺张浪费的现象。
