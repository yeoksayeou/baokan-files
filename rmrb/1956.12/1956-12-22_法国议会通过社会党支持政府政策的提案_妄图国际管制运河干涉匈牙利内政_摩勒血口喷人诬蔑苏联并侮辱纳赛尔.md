Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Paris dispatch: The French National Assembly, on the evening of the 20th, passed a motion proposed by the Socialist Party parliamentary group supporting the Mollet government's foreign policy with 325 votes against 210 (36 abstentions), thus ending the three-day foreign policy debate.

    The Socialist Party's motion calls on the government to continue its policies, seeking to "establish an international management system for the Suez Canal, or any other system that provides all user countries with the same guarantees," and to "comprehensively resolve the Middle East peace issue." The motion advocates "strengthening the Atlantic Alliance on the basis of equal rights and obligations" of the member states of the North Atlantic Group, and to quickly conclude various treaties related to "European unification," so that "as many European countries as possible" participate in or have "extensive ties" with these treaties. The motion also calls for "strengthening" the United Nations.

    Communist, Progressive Republican Union, Radical Socialist Party members, and some other members voted against the motion. Members of the Catholic People's Republican Party, Independent Republican Party, and some other right-wing parties voted in favor, along with Mollet's own Socialist Party members.

    The National Assembly also passed a motion interfering in Hungary's internal affairs with 433 votes against 149. This motion calls on the government to "take all effective measures" to reach an "international agreement" to "guarantee" Hungary's "independence and freedom."

    Before the vote on the Socialist Party's motion, Mollet spoke, defending his foreign policy. Mollet used the so-called Soviet "infiltration" of the Middle East and North Africa as a pretext for France's aggressive policy towards Egypt. He stated that the demand for Anglo-French action in the Middle East is as "urgent today as it was yesterday." He also stated that French colonialists do not intend to leave North Africa. He said that the North African issue is the basis of French foreign policy.

    Mollet repeatedly and violently insulted Egyptian President Nasser, at one moment calling him a Soviet "stooge" and "tool," and at another moment comparing him to Hitler. He also described Israel's military aggression as an act of self-defense, and stated that if Israel failed, the West would "lament" for it, just as it "lamented for martyred Hungary."

    Mollet insisted on the claim of so-called "international management" of the Suez Canal.

    Mollet also talked about the North Atlantic Group. He reiterated that the North Atlantic Alliance remains one of the foundations of French foreign policy.

    法国议会通过社会党支持政府政策的提案
    妄图国际管制运河干涉匈牙利内政
    摩勒血口喷人诬蔑苏联并侮辱纳赛尔
    新华社21日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会20日晚上以三百二十五票对二百一十票（三十六票弃权），通过了社会党议会党团提出的支持摩勒政府外交政策的提案，从而结束了为期三天的外交政策辩论。
    社会党的提案要求政府继续执行它的政策，设法“建立国际管理苏伊士运河的制度，或者使所有使用国得到同样保证的其他任何制度”，并且要“全面解决中东和平问题”。提案主张在北大西洋集团各成员国“权利和义务平等的基础上加强大西洋联盟”，并且迅速缔结有关“欧洲统一”的各种条约，“使尽可能多的欧洲国家”参加进去，或是同这些条约发生“广泛的联系”。提案还要求“加强”联合国。
    共产党、进步共和联盟、激进社会党议员及其他一些议员投票反对这个提案。天主教的人民共和党、独立共和党及其他一些右翼党派议员，同摩勒自己的社会党议员一道投赞成票。
    国民议会还以四百三十三票对一百四十九票通过了一个干涉匈牙利内政的提案，这个提案要求政府“采取一切有效措施”来达成一项“国际协议”，以“保证”匈牙利的“独立和自由”。
    在表决社会党的提案前，摩勒发言，为他的外交政策辩护。摩勒以所谓苏联“渗入”中东和北非作为法国对埃及采取侵略政策的借口。他表示，英法要在中东采取行动的要求，在“今天和昨天一样迫切”。他也表示，法国殖民主义者不打算离开北非。他说，北非问题是法国外交政策的基础。
    摩勒一次又一次地猛烈侮辱埃及总统纳赛尔，一会儿说他是苏联的“走卒”和“工具”，一会儿又把他比作希特勒。他还把以色列的军事侵略说成是自卫行动，并且表示，如果以色列失败了，西方就会为它“悲叹”，正像它“为殉道的匈牙利悲叹一样”。
    摩勒坚持所谓“国际管理”苏伊士运河的主张。
    摩勒还谈到北大西洋集团。他重申，北大西洋联盟仍然是法国外交政策的基础之一。
