I read in "Shen Xian Zhuan" that there is a kind of "Thousand-Day Wine" that makes you drunk for a thousand days after drinking it. This fairy wine only makes people drunk and unconscious and has no other benefits. Watching "Shim Cheong" is like entering a colorful and fragrant garden, intoxicating people with the joy of youth.

In a play, the characters that are loved and sympathized with are always those who are steadfast and unchanging for the sake of justice, love, or an ideal; or those who sacrifice themselves to fulfill others for a pure wish. Shim Cheong is a naive, pure, and hardworking girl who, in order to relieve her father's pain and restore his blinded eyes, does not hesitate to throw herself to the sea god as a sacrifice. This moved the Dragon King and the Jade Emperor; she was resurrected and sent back to the world. Her father initially didn't believe it, but when he heard her sing the most familiar lullaby that he used to sing to her in her childhood, he stepped forward and held his daughter's hand tightly, and his eyes suddenly recovered. Following that, all the blind people also opened their eyes and saw the world of light they had never seen before.

A kind-hearted, hardworking, and brave girl like Shim Cheong should not die tragically and should be resurrected even if she dies—based on the people's wishes, beautiful and moving legends are created from folk tales. Gods like the Dragon King and the Jade Emperor are originally from human imagination. When they are to appear in the story, they are given compassionate characters. This is how Shim Cheong returns to the human world from the bottom of the sea. This story has been circulating among the Korean people for a long time. Today, seeing this opera, its clear tendency enhances its realistic significance, which further demonstrates the strength of the playwright and director.

The most captivating aspect of this play is the national characteristic of Korean art. As soon as we hear the prelude, we are attracted by the melody, rhythm, and timbre of Korean music. In particular, the sounds of the geomungo, piri, galgo, and janggu will not be forgotten once you have heard Korean music once or twice. At the opening, the lines and colors of the scenery show a unique Oriental flavor. The language, movements, costumes, and labor habits constitute the basis of Korean national form. The singing style is somewhat similar to that of China, Japan, and India, but it is by no means the same. The dance movements—whether it is hand movements, foot movements, crouching, or turning—can only be seen in Korean dance. Korean classical dance and Chinese classical dance were both influenced by Central Asian dance and Indian dance, and historically, the artistic exchanges between our two countries were quite frequent in the past, with much mutual learning and mutual influence in music and dance. However, Korean classical dance is an outstanding artistic creation of the Korean people, with its unique form and style, and like Chinese classical dance, it is not found in any other country. The music in "Shim Cheong" fully demonstrates the national characteristics of Korean music, but has it also learned from Western symphonic music to some extent? I think it is possible. Especially in terms of orchestration, I think it's very good. The plucked, blown, and bowed instruments all play their due roles in the appropriate positions. The atmosphere created by the music is consistent with the development of the plot, gradually leading the play to a climax. These are all things we should learn from. We must learn how they sort out their heritage, promote tradition, and correctly learn from foreign things.

This play is a mythological drama, but the performance methods used are realistic. The director humanizes the Dragon King, the shrimp soldiers and crab generals, and the celestial maidens, treating the gods as humans. Shim Cheong's sinking to the bottom of the sea is like going to another country, and then she is sent home. There is a benefit to doing this, which is that it does not separate the human world from the fairy world too clearly, and the style of the whole play is easier to harmonize.

The actors' performances are all simple and sincere. There is no excessive acting; there is no showing off talent, and they perform appropriately and reasonably. It is commendable that Shim Cheong (played by Shin Woo-sun) and Blind Shim (played by Jung Nam-hee) express their inner accumulation fluently and freely.

Many group dances are interspersed and arranged very well. Some opera dance scenes are added very stiffly, often disconnected from the play, which looks uncomfortable. The dances in this play are combined with the plot, so they don't feel stiff. When the Dragon King sends Shim Cheong back to the world on the Jade Emperor's decree, a flower sedan is carried out, an old immortal leads her to the platform, and the dance team pulls the colored ribbons back and forth below. Shim Cheong sits on the flower sedan, and several immortals lift her up. This scene is handled very cleverly and adorably.

The set design has a good layout, and the lines and colors are very harmonious, which is suitable for such an opera; but it seems a bit complicated. This is the only opinion I can offer.

This play is divided into five acts and seven scenes. When everyone looked at the program, they thought it would take four hours to perform, but it was finished in three hours. It is handled concisely from beginning to end, without being protracted. Although the audience doesn't understand the language, they can understand the plot, and they watch it with full attention from beginning to end, returning home with a feeling of emotion.

I am a drama worker and often have to watch plays. Sometimes I watch too many, and my senses seem to become a little dull. The fresh atmosphere of "Shim Cheong" restores me to an ordinary audience, and like everyone else, I get to enjoy artistic and aesthetic pleasure. I cannot but express my heartfelt thanks to the Korean National Folk Art Theater.

    朝鲜唱剧“沈清传”的艺术成就
    欧阳予倩
    读神仙传，据说有一种千日酒，喝了醉千日。这种仙酒只能使人沉醉不醒，没听说有别的好处。看“沈清传”就好像进了一个彩色缤纷、芬芳四溢的花园，把人陶醉在青春的喜悦之中。
    戏里头为人所喜爱、得人同情的人物，总是为了正义、为了爱，或者为了一个理想坚贞自持始终不变的；或者为了一个纯洁的愿望牺牲自己成全别人的。沈清便是一个天真纯洁、欢喜劳动的少女，为了解除父亲的痛苦、要使她父亲已经瞎了的眼睛重见光明，便不惜投身去祭海神，以此感动了龙王，感动了玉皇大帝；她复活了，被送还阳世。她的父亲最初不相信，及至听她唱出最熟悉的、在她儿时他经常唱给她听的摇篮曲，他上前紧紧拉住女儿的手，他的眼睛忽然好了。跟着所有的盲人也都睁开了眼睛，看见了他们从来没见过的光明世界。
    像沈清那样心地善良、勤劳勇敢的少女不应当横死，死了也应当复活——根据人民这样的愿望，美丽动人的传说故事便从民间创造出来。像龙王、玉帝这些神道本来都是出于人的想像，当要他们在故事中出场的时候，便都付与慈悲的性格。这样就使沈清从海底回到人间。这个故事在朝鲜人民中流传久远，今天看到这个唱剧，由于它鲜明的倾向性加强了它的现实意义，这更显示出编剧和导演的力量。
    这个戏最引人入胜的就是朝鲜艺术的民族特点。我们一听前奏曲，就被朝鲜音乐的旋律、节奏和乐器的音色吸引住了。尤其是玄琴、筚篥、羯鼓、长鼓的声音，只要听过一两次朝鲜音乐的就不会忘记。一开幕，布景的线条和色彩显示出特有的东方情调。语言、动作、服装、劳动习惯等构成朝鲜民族形式的基础自不用说，歌的唱法和中国、日本、印度有某些相似之处，但又绝不相同。舞蹈的动作——无论是手的动作、脚的动作、蹲下、转身的样子都只能在朝鲜舞里见到。朝鲜的古典舞蹈和中国的古典舞蹈都曾受中亚细亚舞蹈和印度舞蹈的影响，而且从历史上看，我们两国过去艺术交流颇为频繁，在音乐舞蹈方面互相学习、互相影响之处甚多。可是朝鲜的古典舞蹈是朝鲜人民卓越的艺术创造，有其独特的形式和风格，也和中国的古典舞蹈一样是任何其他国家所没有的。“沈清传”里的音乐充分显示着朝鲜音乐的民族特点，但是不是也曾以西洋交响乐为借鉴多少受些影响？我想是可能的。特别在配器方面，我觉得很好。弹的吹的拉的都在适当的位置发挥了应有的作用。音乐所造成的气氛和戏的情节进展结合一致，逐渐把戏引向高潮。这都是我们应当好好地学习的。我们要学习他们如何整理遗产、发扬传统，如何正确地学习外国的东西。
    这个戏是神话剧，所用的表演方法却是现实主义的。导演把龙王和虾兵蟹将以及像仙姬们都使之人化，把神当作人来处理。沈清沉到海底就像到了另外一个国家，又被送回家里。这样做有一个好处，就是不会把人间和仙界分得太清楚，整个戏的风格也就比较容易调和。
    演员们的表演都很朴素而真切。没有过火的表演；没有矜才使气的地方，恰如其分地演得入情入理。沈清（申又善饰）和沈瞎子（丁南希饰）圆转自如地表达出内心的蕴蓄颇为难能可贵。
    有许多群舞的穿插，都安排得很好。有些歌剧的舞蹈场面加得很生硬，往往和戏脱节，看起来便不舒服。这个戏里的舞蹈和戏情结合便不觉得生硬。当龙王奉了玉帝敕旨送沈清还阳，一乘花轿抬出来，一个老仙人拉着她走上平台，下面舞队来回地牵引着彩色绸带，沈清坐上花轿，几个仙人把她抬起来。这个场面处理得很聪明，很可爱。
    布景设计布局很好，线条色彩都很调和，适宜于这样一个歌剧；但似乎略为繁复一点。这是我所能提的惟一的意见。
    这个戏分五幕七场。当看节目单时大家以为一定要演四个小时，结果三小时就演完了。从头到尾处理得简洁，不拖沓。观众们虽然不懂话，对剧情都能了解，都精神饱满一气贯注地看完，带着感动的心情回去。
    我是个戏剧工作者，经常要看些戏。有时看得太多了，似乎感觉便有些迟钝。“沈清传”的清新气息使我回复到一个普通的观众，和大家一样得到艺术的、美的享受，这不能不对朝鲜国立民族艺术剧团致以衷心的感谢。
