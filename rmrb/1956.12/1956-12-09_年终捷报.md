　　Year-End Triumphs
　　National Electric Power Industry
　　This newspaper reports that the national state-owned electric power industry has completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule. The power generation plan was completed ahead of schedule on December 7th, and the electricity sales plan was also completed ahead of schedule on December 4th.
　　Due to the early completion of the electricity sales plan, and the increase in power generation by hydroelectric power plants in various regions this year compared to the plan, the profit remittance plan of the power industry production units will also be overfulfilled this year. According to statistics up to the end of November alone, national electric power production enterprises have already completed 99% of the annual profit remittance plan. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the over-planned profit remittance will be equivalent to the investment for building a 30,000 kilowatt power plant.
　　Several technical and economic indicators in the electric power industry's production plan have also been reduced compared to this year's plan. Due to the reduction in coal consumption rates in national thermal power plants, 80,000 tons of standard coal were saved from January to November this year; the electricity consumption of machines within power plants has also been reduced compared to the plan, saving a total of 40 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in eleven months this year.
　　Shanghai Industry
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 8th - According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau: As of the end of November, the total industrial output value of Shanghai has exceeded this year's annual plan by 2%.
　　Factories and enterprises in Shanghai under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, and the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry, as well as factories and enterprises under the Shanghai Municipal First Heavy Industry Bureau, Second Heavy Industry Bureau, First Light Industry Bureau, and Second Light Industry Bureau, have all overfulfilled this year's total output value targets.
　　The industrial production level in Shanghai in November was the highest this year. The total output value for this month increased by 8.1% compared to October; the actual output of twenty out of twenty-five major products exceeded the planned targets for November.
　　Shenyang Local Mechanical and Electrical Industry
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 8th - The ninety-nine mechanical and electrical factories under the Shenyang Municipal First Industry Bureau had remitted more than 24 million yuan in profits to the state by the end of November, exceeding the total annual plan by 4.78 million yuan.
　　The main factors for the overfulfillment of the profit remittance plan by these factories this year are the significant achievements made in saving steel materials and reducing costs. Steel material costs account for 60% of the total production costs of each mechanical and electrical factory, and 80% for individual factories. Therefore, this year, each factory vigorously carried out work on utilizing waste materials, scrap materials, substitute materials, and rational use of materials. Some factories found scrap iron cans to replace good steel plates; some factories used scrap silicon steel sheets to replace good silicon steel sheets; some factories dug out scrap steel buried underground to replace good steel. Due to the vigorous saving of materials, the product costs of these local state-owned and joint state-private factories have been greatly reduced.

### 年终捷报

专栏：年终捷报

　　年终捷报
　  全国电力工业
    本报讯　全国国营电力工业提前完成了今年生产计划。发电量计划提前在12月7日完成，售电量计划也提前在12月4日完成了。
    由于售电量计划提前完成，以及今年各地水力发电厂的发电比计划有了增加，今年电力工业生产单位的上缴利润计划也将超额完成，仅至11月底的统计，全国电业生产企业已经完成全年上缴利润计划的99％。预计到年底，超计划上缴的利润，就相当于建设一座三万瓩发电厂的投资。
    电力工业生产计划中的几种技术经济指标，也比今年的计划有了降低。全国火力发电厂由于煤耗率的降低，今年1至11月节省了八万吨标准煤；发电厂厂内机器的用电也比计划有了减少，今年十一个月共节省了四千万度电力。
    上海工业
    新华社上海8日电　据上海市统计局统计：到11月底为止，上海工业的总产值已经超过今年年度计划的2％。
    冶金工业部、化学工业部和电机制造工业部所属在上海的工厂企业，以及上海市第一重工业局、第二重工业局、第一轻工业局和第二轻工业局所属的工厂企业，都已经超额完成了今年的总产值指标。
   11月份的上海工业生产水平，是今年最高的一个月。这个月的生产总值比10月份增长了8.1％；二十五种主要产品的实际产量，就有二十种超过11月份的计划指标。
　  沈阳地方机电工业
    据新华社沈阳8日电　沈阳市第一工业局所属九十九个机电工厂，到11月底为止，上缴给国家的利润已经有二千四百多万元，超过全年计划总额四百七十八万元。
    这批工厂今年所以能超额完成上缴利润计划，主要的因素是在节约钢铁材料和降低成本方面取得了显著的成就。各机电工厂钢铁材料费用占全部生产费用60％，个别工厂占80％。因此，今年各工厂大力开展了利用废料、边料、代用材料和合理使用材料的工作。有的工厂寻找废铁罐代替好钢板；有的工厂利用废釸钢片代替好釸钢片；有的工厂挖出埋在地下的废钢铁代替好钢铁。这批地方国营、公私合营工厂，由于大力节约材料，产品成本大大降低。
