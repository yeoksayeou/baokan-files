    Let the Flowers of Sculptural Art Bloom!
    Yuxing
    "Sculptural art," as one of the hundreds of flowers, should be given the opportunity to fully bloom. However, for any flower to bloom well, it needs someone to carefully care for and cultivate it. Otherwise, even if it has excellent seeds and strong seedlings, it will not be able to grow or will wither and die. The current situation of sculptural art is precisely like this; it almost has no ground to take root, grow, and bloom. Relevant leading departments and leaders do not pay attention to it, or simply forget about it. Architects do not think of it in the large-scale design of various projects, or are afraid of being accused of waste, so they do not leave space for it. Some architects simply do not know sculptural art.
    Therefore, many young friends who study sculpture with me often worry about the future of sculptural art.
    Of course, there are many reasons why sculptural art is not flourishing. However, the lack of concern from relevant parties is the main reason at present.
    Some people say that the Chinese people do not understand sculpture and therefore do not need it. This statement is clearly unfounded. Since ancient times, sculptural art has been widely used in our vast cities and rural areas. From the palaces of emperors to the temples, ancestral halls, and mausoleums of villages and towns, there are diverse contents and forms of sculpture, which demonstrate the Chinese people's undeniable talent in sculptural art. There are also many small-scale folk sculptures that remain as precious treasures of our national culture. Therefore, it is wrong to think that the Chinese people do not understand and do not need sculpture.
    Some people believe that from the point of view of saving, sculptural art is not needed. This statement is also unreasonable. To regard sculptural art as a waste that should be saved is in itself an indication of their erroneous attitude towards sculptural art. Last year, the "People's Daily" published Comrade Khrushchev's report, which criticized the excessive application of sculpture in construction projects, resulting in waste of funds. However, Comrade Khrushchev was criticizing the current situation in the Soviet Union, not the current situation in China, where sculpture is rarely used or not used at all. It should be known that after the victory of the October Revolution, Comrade Lenin personally drafted a commemorative propaganda plan to build monuments for many national heroes, scholars, scientists, artists, poets, and thinkers. In decades of construction, the Soviet Union has built its cities and villages not only to meet the needs of people's lives, but also to be very beautiful. Parks, squares, stations, cultural palaces, museums, cinemas, and stadiums—wherever there are mass activities, there are touching and educational sculptural images, which not only beautify the cities and countryside but also give the people tremendous encouragement and endless spiritual strength.
    The people understand and need sculptural art. It is inappropriate that our country's current large-scale construction projects and urban planning do not adequately consider sculptural art. Of course, the problem is not simple. "Everything is hard in the beginning," but difficulties can be overcome.

    让雕刻艺术的花也开放吧
    雨行
    “雕刻艺术”作为百花中的一花，是应该得到充分开放的时候了。但任何一种花，要使它开得好，都需要有人细心的照顾和培植，否则即使它有优良的种子和茁壮的幼苗，也都会无法生长或干枯而死。雕刻艺术目前的情况正是这样，它几乎还没有生根、成长和开放的园地。有关领导部门和领导者们对它不重视，或者是干脆忘掉了。建筑师们在规模宏大的各种工程设计中没有想到要它，或者怕反浪费反到自己头上，没有给它留下位置，有些建筑师就根本不知道雕刻艺术。
    因此和我一起学习雕刻的许多青年朋友们，经常都为雕刻艺术的前途而忧虑。
    当然，雕刻艺术不繁荣的原因是多方面的。但有关方面对雕刻艺术不够关心，在当前来说是主要的。
    有人说，中国的人民群众对雕刻不了解，因而也不需要它。这种说法显然是没有根据的。自古以来，在我国广大城市和农村中，雕刻艺术都被广泛的应用。从帝王的宫殿到村镇的庙宇、祠堂、陵墓等，都有多种多样的内容和形式的雕刻，而且显示了中国人民在雕刻艺术上有着不可忽视的才能。还有许多小型的民间雕刻艺术品，至今留为我国民族文化的珍贵财富。因此，认为我国人民群众对雕刻不了解和不需要，是错误的说法。
    有人认为，从节约的观点看，是不需要雕刻艺术的。这种说法也毫无道理。把雕刻艺术作为是应该被节约掉的一种浪费，其本身也就说明了他们对于雕刻艺术的错误态度。前年“人民日报”刊载过赫鲁晓夫同志的报告，其中批判过建筑工程中过多的应用雕刻而浪费了资金。但是，赫鲁晓夫同志批判的是苏联当前的情况，而不是中国当前极少应用和根本不用雕刻的情况。要知道十月革命胜利后，列宁同志还亲自动手拟定过一个纪念性宣传计划，为许多民族英雄、学者、科学家、艺术家、诗人和思想家们修建了纪念碑。苏联在几十年间的建设中，已经把他的城市和农村，修建得不但很合于人们生活的需要，而且非常美丽，公园、广场、车站、文化宫、博物馆、影剧院、运动场，只要是群众的活动场所，都有十分动人的富有教育意义的雕刻形象，它们不仅美化了城市和乡村，而且给予了人民群众以莫大的鼓舞作用和无穷的精神力量。
    人民是了解和需要雕刻艺术的。我国目前正在大规模进行的建设工程中和城市规划中，没有适当考虑到雕刻艺术是不应该的。当然，问题并不简单。“万事起头难”，但困难是可以克服的。
