　　“If you want to understand the painful life of this place in the past, threatened by drought, let me tell you, even if we lit lamps and talked for countless nights, we still wouldn’t finish.”

　　This is what people told me when I arrived in Qian'gongping Township, Fenghuang County.

　　The Miao people, who have lived here for generations, have searched countless mountains and drilled through countless caves to find water, but in the end, they still haven't found it.

　　"If the People's Government can solve the water conservancy problem for us, our children and grandchildren will never forget it."

　　The people once deeply hoped for the Party and the government.

　　From the time of liberation, cadres of the Party and government also visited the mountains and caves time and time again, but the result was the same. Last summer, the county head personally led five cadres to this township, and near an ancient cave that hadn’t seen flowing water for a long time, they seemed to hear bursts of gurgling sounds. So they desperately dug down, using four bamboo poles, each two zhang long, to extend downward. After working for five days and five nights, they finally drew up two loads of water.

　　The local Party and government were indeed facing a serious problem.

　　As early as the land reform in the winter of 1951 and spring of 1952, people began to study ways to fundamentally eliminate drought. They heard from the masses that there was no shortage of water here, but the land leaked water. There was an underground river called the "yin river." Every year when it rained heavily, there was also water flowing in the streams, but soon the water flowed from the sinkholes on the ground to the "yin river." In the spring of 1952, in order to store this precious water, people built a dam at the source of the stream. Because they didn’t have any experience in building dams at that time, the quality of the project was not high, and it couldn’t hold water. People discussed building a large reservoir, so that the lives of thousands upon thousands of Miao people could be guaranteed. However, some people said that the land leaked water and it couldn't be stored. To clarify this issue, geological engineers were invited in 1954. The geological engineers conducted a preliminary survey and judged that there were no folds or faults in the geology at the source of the stream, there would be no yin river, and a reservoir built here would not leak. People were overjoyed, and the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau sent technical cadres, who immediately began designing.

　　It was almost as urgent as sparks, and while the first design drawing was still in the office of the Water Conservancy Department of the Provincial People’s Committee, and the engineers were still studying it, the revised design drawing was sent there again. The project of this dam was arduous and complex. If the design was not good, or even if there was a problem underground, wouldn't that mean that drought would continue to plague the Miao people? Last autumn, Gu Zhili, deputy chief engineer of the Provincial Water Conservancy Department, came to Fenghuang. He conducted repeated studies of the geological conditions, dam site, and dam type selection here. People wanted to build this reservoir into the most reliable reservoir.

　　Although geological engineers had surveyed here, they still held symposiums with veteran farmers to learn about geological conditions and mobilized cadres and the masses to conduct a general inspection on the mountain. Three caves were found on the mountain ridges on both sides of the stream source. If the caves were connected to the yin river in the lower section of the stream, wouldn't the water leak out when the reservoir was built and the water level exceeded the caves? People found yellow mud water and tung oil and poured it into the caves. The yellow mud water and tung oil did not flow away, but flowed into the stream, which is to say, it still flowed into the future reservoir. Only then did people breathe a sigh of relief.

　　Was there a problem with the mountain cave that served as the future reservoir's spillway? Despite the fact that some locals said how magical the cave was and no one had ever dared to enter it, He Qixiang, head of the Water Conservancy Section of the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau, led two cadres into the cave. After repeated inspections, he believed that the rock structure was consistent with the rock structure under the reservoir; at the same time, they measured the water flow at the exit of the cave, which was consistent with the water flow when entering the cave, proving that the water did not disappear or increase when flowing through the cave, that is to say, there was no cave inside that led to the yin river.

　　The engineers designed three dam sites and eight dam types, repeatedly compared them, studied the traditional Chinese experience in building arch dams, and referred to the experience of the Soviet Union and Poland in building dams. Finally, it was decided to build an arch dam at the entrance of the cave. The dam is 23.35 meters high, the second highest dam in Hunan Province.

　　At the end of 1955, the massive reservoir construction project began. Cement that could withstand heavy water pressure was transported from Taiyuan, Shanxi, and seamless steel pipes for flood discharge were transported from Anshan Iron and Steel. Han Chinese technicians and Han Chinese stonemasons arrived promptly from other places. People shouted the loud slogan: "Support the Miao brothers!" In this mountain village area, it goes without saying that winter is cold, but even in spring, there is still snow flying in March. The Han Chinese workers and stonemasons, along with the local Miao laborers who participated in the construction of the reservoir, endured the cold; sometimes they even had to jump into the icy water to work, and they had no complaints. Many Miao laborers had never experienced such a large project, and their skills could not keep up, so the Han Chinese workers and Han Chinese stonemasons patiently helped them. When they first started carrying rocks, every rock-carrying team had a Han Chinese stonemason, who worked with the Miao laborers for two days, teaching them how to put on ropes and wear carrying poles. When the laborers were about to carry the stone to the dam site, the stonemasons would take over. Miao laborer Ou Qiyuan said: "These Hakka people (i.e., Han people) are really good, they help us with everything."

　　In early June of this year, the reservoir named Sanjiangzhai was completed, and the water that the Miao people had been looking forward to day and night for generations flowed joyfully along the crisscrossing channels to the fields. People cheered along both sides of the channel. Old men and old women in their seventies and eighties with poor eyesight were vying to be led to the side of the channel, and they said, we can't see the water, let us touch it!

　　From this time on, many fields here will no longer be threatened by drought. Although it has not rained for more than two months this year—the worst drought in decades—the more than 1,400 mu of fields irrigated by the reservoir still produced more than 160,000 jin more grain than last year. The indescribable suffering that drought brought to people is gone forever. (Attached picture)

　　苗乡纪行
　　罗印文
    “你想了解这个地方过去受干旱威胁的痛苦生活吧，告诉你，就是点起灯说上无数个夜晚，也是讲不完的。”
    当我来到凤凰县千弓坪乡的时候，人们这样对我说。
    聚居在这里的苗族人民，祖祖辈辈为了找寻水，不知道踏遍多少山头，钻过多少岩洞，到头来还是没有找到。
    “人民政府只要能够给我们解决水利问题，我们子子孙孙也不会忘记。”
    人民曾经这样深切地盼望着党和政府。
    从解放的时候起，党和政府的干部也曾经一次又一次地遍访山头和岩洞，结果还是一样。去年夏天，县长亲自率领五个干部来到这个乡，在一个古老的早就没有见过流水的洞边，仿佛听到一阵阵的潺潺声，于是拼命往下挖，用四根两丈长的竹子通下去，接连搞了五天五夜，才抽上来两担水。
    当地党和政府确实面临着一个严重的问题。
    早在1951年冬1952年春进行土地改革的时候，人们就着手研究从根本上消除干旱的办法。听群众说，这里不是没有水，是因为这里的地漏水。地底下有河，叫做“阴河”。每年落大雨时，溪道里也有水奔流，但不久水就从地面上的陷眼流到“阴河”去了。1952年春天，人们为了把这宝贵的水蓄住，便在溪道源头筑了座坝，因为那时还没有筑坝的经验，工程质量不高，盛不住水。人们计议着要修大型水库，不能让成千成万的苗族人民的生活没有保障。但是，有些群众说，地漏水，蓄不住的。为了闹清楚这个问题，在1954年请来了地质工程师。地质工程师作了初步的勘查，判断溪道源头的地底没有褶皱和断层的构造，不会有阴河，在这里修水库不会漏水。人们高兴已极，湘西苗族自治州农林水利局派来了技术干部，立即开始设计。
    简直有些急如星火了，当第一张设计图纸还在省人民委员会水利厅办公室，工程师们正在研究的时候，修正的设计图纸又送去了。这个拦水坝的工程是艰巨复杂的。如果万一设计不好，甚至万一地底下出了问题，那不是意味着干旱还要侵袭苗族人民吗？去年秋天，省水利厅派了副总工程师顾知礼来到凤凰。他在这里对地层情况、坝址和坝型的选择等，作了一次又一次的研究。人们要把这个水库建成为最可靠的水库。
    虽然地质工程师在这里勘察过，他们还是召开了老农座谈会，向他们了解地层情况，并且发动干部和群众上山作普遍检查。在溪道源头两边的山坎上发现了三个岩洞。要是岩洞同溪道下段的阴河相通，到水库建成，蓄水面超过岩洞时，水不就漏掉了吗？人们找来了黄泥水和桐油，往洞里灌，黄泥水和桐油不是流走了，而是流到溪道里来了，也就是说仍旧流到了未来的水库里，人们才算松了一口气。
    那个作为未来水库的溢洪道的山洞有没有问题呢？尽管当地有人说，这个洞如何神奇，从来没有人敢进去过，湘西苗族自治州农林水利局水利科科长贺奇响，还是带领两个干部进洞去了。反复查看后，认为岩层构造和水库下岩层构造一致；同时他们在山洞出口的地方，测量了水流量，和进洞时水流量一致，证明水流经山洞时，没有消失或增加，也就是说里边没有通阴河的洞。
    工程师们设计了三个坝址和八种坝型，反复进行比较，并且研究了我国民间传统的修筑拱坝的经验，参考了苏联和波兰修筑拦河坝的经验，最后确定在山洞进口的地方修建拱坝。坝身高二十三点三五公尺，是湖南省第二个最高的坝。
    1955年底，规模浩大的水库建设工程开始了，经得起水力重压的水泥从山西太原运来了，泄洪用的无缝钢管从鞍钢运来了。汉族技术工人和汉族岩匠都从外地及时赶来了。人们喊出了响亮的口号：“支援苗族兄弟！”在这个山村地区，不用说冬天是冷的，就是在春天，三月还有飞雪。汉族工人和岩匠，同当地参加修建水库的苗族民工一道，忍受着寒冷；有时甚至要跳到冰冷的水中进行工作，也都没有怨言。许多苗族民工没有经历过这样大的工程，技术跟不上，汉族工人和汉族岩匠就耐心帮助他们。开始抬岩的时候，每一抬岩小组里，都有一个汉族岩匠参加，和苗族民工一起抬两天，教给他们如何套绳子，穿扛子。当民工们把石方快要抬到筑坝的地方的时候，岩匠们就来接肩。苗族民工欧启元说：“这些客家人（即汉人）真好，哪一样都帮助我们。”
    今年6月初，这个命名为三江寨的水库建成了，苗族人民世世代代日夜盼望着的水，顺着那纵横交错的渠道，欢腾地流向田野。人们沿着渠道两岸欢呼着。眼睛不大好的七八十岁的老伯伯和老大娘，争着要人领到渠道边，他们说，我们看不着水，让我们去摸摸吧！
    从这个时候起，这里许多田地再也不会受旱灾的威胁了。今年虽然两个多月没有下雨——是近几十年来没有过的大干旱，但水库所灌溉的一千四百多亩田，仍然比去年增产粮食十六万多斤。干旱所带给人们的说不尽的痛苦，一去不复返了。（附图片）
