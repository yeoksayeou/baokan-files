　　Milk Powder Production to Increase Substantially Next Year

　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th – In response to the high demand for milk powder, food industry departments across the country are working with relevant departments to implement measures to increase milk powder production. The food industry department estimates that national milk powder production will increase by about 30% next year compared to this year.

　　To expand milk sources, food industry departments are assisting pastures in major milk-producing areas such as Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang to add equipment, differentiate dairy cow breeds, assign dedicated personnel for milking, and improve dairy cow feeding conditions. Currently, thirty state-owned farms across the country have been converted into farms primarily raising dairy cows. Local grain departments are also assisting farms in resolving the problem of winter feed supply for dairy cows. Many milk powder factories have begun to organize mobile purchasing stations and add equipment for storing fresh milk. In addition, relevant departments have appropriately adjusted the purchase price of fresh milk to encourage herdsmen's enthusiasm for raising dairy cows.

　　Food industry departments across the country are also preparing to adjust and fully utilize existing equipment to increase the production of dairy products. The Zhalainuoer, Yakeshi, and Boketu milk powder factories in Inner Mongolia, which had previously ceased operations, have begun production again. Eight sets of drum-type powder-making machines, which were previously idle, are being renovated and will soon be put into use. Workers in milk powder factories across the country are also preparing to adopt measures such as saving raw materials and appropriately reducing raw material consumption quotas to increase milk powder production. According to calculations, if the raw material consumption quota of milk powder factories in Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang is reduced from 3.1% to 2%, 399 tons of fresh milk can be saved in one year, and this fresh milk can be used to produce 100 tons of milk powder.

　　Before liberation, all dairy products on the Chinese market were imported from abroad. In the years since liberation, more than eighty dairy product factories have been newly built in various parts of the country. The production of dairy products has increased year by year and has basically met the needs of the market. The reason for the current shortage of milk powder in the market is that, on the one hand, the food industry department underestimated the changes in market demand. For example, milk powder had once been overstocked in the market in the first half of this year, and relevant departments blindly believed that milk powder production was excessive. They decided to suspend production and reduce production in some factories, reduce inventory, and lower the purchase price of fresh milk, which greatly reduced milk powder production. On the other hand, the main reason is that China's milk source is insufficient, and the development speed of the dairy product industry has not kept up with the improvement of people's living standards. Therefore, in a considerable period of time, it will still be difficult to fully meet the needs of all parties for milk powder.

### 孩子们的好消息　明年将大量增产奶粉

　　孩子们的好消息
　　明年将大量增产奶粉
    新华社9日讯　各地食品工业部门正在根据奶粉供不应求的情况，协同有关部门采取措施提高奶粉的产量。据食品工业部门预计，全国明年奶粉的产量将比今年提高30％左右。
    为了扩大奶源，食品工业部门正在帮助牛奶主要产地内蒙古、黑龙江等地的牧场增添设备，分别奶牛品种，固定专人挤奶，并改善乳牛的饲养条件。目前，各地已有三十个国营农场改为以养乳牛为主的农场。当地的粮食部门也协助农场解决乳牛冬季饲料的供应问题。许多乳粉厂开始组织流动收购站，增添储存鲜奶的设备。此外，有关部门适当调整了鲜奶的收购价格，以鼓励牧民饲养乳牛的积极性。
    各地食品工业部门还准备调整和充分利用现有设备，提高乳制品的产量。内蒙古地区的扎麦诺尔、牙克石、博克图等原来停工的乳粉厂，已经开始重新生产。各地过去闲置的八付滚筒式制粉机器正在改造，不久可以利用起来。各地乳粉厂的职工，还准备采取节约原料、适当降低原料消耗定额等办法，提高奶粉的产量。据计算，如果内蒙古、黑龙江两地奶粉厂的原料消耗定额由3.1％降低到2％，一年中就能节约三百九十九吨鲜奶，用这些鲜奶可以生产一百吨奶粉。
    解放前，我国市场上的乳制品全部是从国外进口的。解放后的几年来，国内各地新建了八十多个乳制品工厂。乳制品的产量逐年增加，并且基本上满足了市场的需要。今年以来市场上出现的奶粉供不应求的原因，一方面是食品工业部门对市场需要的变化情况估计不足，如今年上半年市场上的奶粉曾经一度积压，有关部门就盲目地认为是奶粉的生产过剩了，并且决定部分工厂停工减产，压缩库存，降低鲜牛奶的收购价格，因而使奶粉的产量大大降低。另一方面，主要是由于我国的乳源不足，乳制品工业发展的速度，还赶不上人民生活水平提高的速度。因此，在一个相当长的时期内，充分满足各方面对奶粉的需要，还有一定的困难。
