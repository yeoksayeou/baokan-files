Simply Because They Are Good at Relying on the Masses of Members
　　Liang Xiaoran Huang Kecheng Fang Yangjing
　　The Xinke First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huayuan County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, is a cooperative that has done a relatively good job in implementing the "democratic cooperative management" policy. This cooperative did not have a working group to help it regularly. It was only because the cooperative cadres were good at going deep into the masses and mobilizing the positive factors among the masses that they finally overcame various difficulties, ran the cooperative well, and achieved a 46.16% increase in production and a 95% increase in income for the members.

　　Emerging from the Chaos
　　The Xinke First Agricultural Cooperative in Malichang Township, Huayuan County, was established this spring and upgraded to a higher-level cooperative in the autumn.
　　In February and March this year, when the cooperative was first established, the temporary labor transfer method adopted by the cooperative could not meet the requirements of collective production. The quality of work was low, production tools were unattended, teams suspected each other, members argued and quarreled, and some teams even stopped working for two or three days, directly affecting the completion of the production plan. At that time, Ma Zhenglin, the director of the cooperative, was so busy that he could not take care of one team without neglecting the other. In order to overcome the chaos in the work, the cooperative management committee studied and formulated labor quotas. In April, when planting corn, it was stipulated that transporting seven loads of manure four li away would be counted as one quota. Five members of the third team carried manure for half a day and were so exhausted that they were unwilling to work any more. Ma Zhenglin discovered this situation at the work site and personally tried carrying manure for a day. He could only carry five loads without feeling too strained. After the quota was revised, everyone resumed work. On another occasion, Ma Zhenglin participated in planting corn in the second team and discovered two problems: one was that the quota for harrowing the soil was too loose. He only harrowed the soil for half a day and reached one quota (three mu). The other was that the division of labor and cooperation was not handled properly. That night, Ma Zhenglin convened the management committee and revised the unreasonable quota. In the process of implementing it over the past six months, the unreasonable quota has been revised nineteen times.

　　The quota was relatively reasonable, but the quality of work still could not be guaranteed. The way that Ma Zhenglin, the director of the cooperative, dealt with this problem was to patiently help the members correct their mistakes. Some female members of the second team loved to compete for work points. When they were weeding, they only picked the loosely packed jobs. Even if it was in their own area of responsibility, they would not care about the tightly packed plots, and the quality of work was not good. One day, the director of the cooperative discovered their behavior of disregarding quality at the work site. In the evening, he consciously went to "chat" with a female member who was competing for work points and slowly explained to her the harm of simply competing for work points without considering quality. The female member felt very sad, and the next night she voluntarily made a self-criticism at the meeting, educating several other female members. A member of the seventh team usually loved to make petty calculations, even adding water and stones to the grass he cut for the cattle. Huang Xueren, the director of the supervisory committee, adopted the method used by the director of the cooperative to educate the female member who was competing for work points, which changed his attitude towards labor. Several members of this team who usually loved to take small advantages and disregard the quality of work also changed because they were influenced by this member.

　　In this way, the enthusiasm of the vast majority of members gradually increased, and the attendance rate rose from the original 65% to a regular 90% or so. The working hours also increased from six hours to nine hours per day.

　　The Problem of Pocket Money is Solved
　　In early May, production began to get on the right track, and new problems arose. Every market day, the members would borrow money from the cooperative to buy daily necessities. The cooperative studied ways to solve this problem and decided to develop diversified operations. They found that the cooperative could collectively operate side businesses such as raising pigs, raising ducks, and growing vegetables throughout the year. Just organizing the members to help the grain depot process rice earned more than 300 yuan, which initially solved the problem of some members lacking pocket money, greatly encouraging the members to develop diversified operations. The management committee also organized the members to develop household side businesses, asking everyone to raise more pigs, raise chickens, dig medicinal herbs, and catch shrimp to increase family income. However, they encountered another difficulty in raising chickens: the myth that had been passed down in this area that "chickens are the Thunder God Bodhisattva, chicken manure cannot be put on the fields or in the soil, and touching a chicken will be struck by lightning" was deeply imprinted in the minds of the Miao farmers. Many members opposed raising chickens. Ma Zhenglin knew that this was a reform issue related to the customs and habits of the ethnic group, and he could not force everyone to raise chickens. He went deep into the homes of members such as Long De'er, Wang Jiashou, and Ma Xinglin, who had already raised chickens, to summarize the benefits of raising chickens. Long De'er told him: This year, he raised two hens and hatched three broods of chicks, sold twenty-two chicks, and earned 15.5 yuan, which solved the problem of oil, salt, and pocket money. Now there are still eighteen chicks in the house, which he plans to sell in the autumn to exchange for a piglet. Ma Zhenglin convened the management committee again and used these vivid facts to convince the members of the cooperative. After the meeting, the cooperative members went to mobilize the masses with practical examples. The traditional superstitious thinking was broken, and the members raised chickens one after another. Last year, only six households raised chickens, but this year, sixty-five households are raising chickens. The members' difficulty in getting pocket money has been resolved.

　　A High Tide of Drought Resistance is Launched
　　After transplanting the rice seedlings, it did not rain for a full two months. By July, more than 200 mu of paddy fields in the whole cooperative were suffering from drought and dehydration. Some members with income from handicrafts wanted to go out to make a living. Many poor members felt that their hearts were willing but their strength was insufficient, and they sighed and complained. The cooperative's superstitious thinking of relying on heaven gradually raised its head. Individual party members, league members, and key members also wavered, shouting slogans of drought resistance but not actively thinking of ways. Seeing that the seedlings were about to wither, drought resistance and seedling protection became the most prominent combat task for the whole cooperative at that time.

　　Long Zhulian, the captain of the fifth team, and Long Jinsheng, a member of the cooperative committee, led all the members of the team to spend three days building a half-li-long water flume on the hillside, drawing out the cool water from the mountain, and saving more than ten mu of rice seedlings that were about to wither. Huang Xueren and others were inspired by this incident in the fifth team. He thought that there was also a stream of cool water near Zhangmu Chong in the seventh team that could be used to irrigate more than 30 mu of land in the Dashan area. So he went to the seventh team to discuss with the members of the seventh team. The members of the seventh team strongly supported his proposal.

　　However, the rationalization proposal of the seventh team to build a flume to resist drought was not approved by the management committee. The mood of Ma Zhenglin, the director of the cooperative, was very heavy. He felt that if he did not try every means to save the seedlings, it would cause a serious reduction in production in the agricultural cooperative. He carefully looked at the terrain and water source of the place where the fifth team built the flume, and carefully compared the water source and terrain of the place where the seventh team requested to build the flume, confirming that the seventh team would definitely be able to build the water flume successfully. He decided to independently support the seventh team in building the water flume, and then find a way to persuade other cooperative committee members. Huang Xueren got the support of the director of the cooperative, returned to the team, and led the members to build the flume on the mountain day and night. Due to overwork, he fell ill and fainted, but still insisted on working while sick. When the grass for binding the bamboo flume was used up, Huang Xueren took out the grass that he used to pad his bed to use. Under his leadership, the morale of the members was even higher, and they shouted the slogan "We will not come down the mountain until the water flume is built." After seven days and seven nights of intense labor, the water flume was finally built successfully. A large stream of spring water, through the undulating bamboo flume, flowed continuously into the paddy fields. The people who originally had pessimistic emotions were vividly educated and their emotions stabilized. A mass drought resistance upsurge immediately appeared in the cooperative. After more than twenty days of tenacious struggle, the drought was finally overcome.

　　The "Trailing Team" Becomes an Advanced Team
　　The work of the fifth production team was originally relatively weak and lacked key members. Although Long Zhulian, the captain of the production team, and Long Jinsheng, a member of the management committee, were determined to run the cooperative well, they lacked experience and had few methods, and often encountered setbacks in their work. Once, the team's scorekeeper, Shi Zongwen (a well-to-do middle peasant), was upset and did not record work points for two days, causing the members to quarrel at the meeting. Captain Long Zhulian was so anxious that he was sweating profusely. Both of them went to the director of the cooperative, one to hand over the work point book and resolutely refuse to do it, and the other to ask the director of the cooperative for a solution. The director of the cooperative encouraged Long Zhulian to boldly let go and do it, and also told him to pay attention to finding support forces, discovering and cultivating activists in his work. So they paid attention to cultivating Long De'er, Wang Daquan, Shi Bagang, Long Bage and others who were the poorest, most loyal, and also worked well. Once, when the work was over, some members left more than ten pieces of farm equipment such as hoes and manure buckets on the ground. Long Jinsheng picked them up and took them back. At the team's general meeting, Captain Long Zhulian praised Long Jinsheng's and others' exemplary behavior of loving the cooperative. From then on, the righteous spirit in the team gradually rose, and the situation began to improve.

　　They also cultivated the Long Peitang and Long Peize brothers to replace the work of scorekeeper Shi Zongwen. Because of their low level of education, they did not keep the accounts well at first. Captain Long Zhulian was determined to cultivate his brothers to become assistants in his work, so he went to Long Peitang's house and lived with him, talked for three nights, and conducted meticulous class education and education on uniting everyone to do a good job in production. The Long Peitang brothers were finally mobilized. At a team member meeting, the two of them took the initiative to examine their shortcomings and assured the members that they would learn accounting techniques, improve their accounting ability, and keep good work accounts. The number of activists in this team has increased from four to eleven. The production tasks assigned by the cooperative can be completed on time or exceeded. In the spring, when planting corn, the fifth team was always the "trailing team" that completed the task last. In the autumn, when harvesting rice, the situation changed. The fifth team completed the task five days ahead of all the other teams and transferred manpower to support the brother teams.

　　More and More Good People and Good Deeds
　　Among the members, there are many exemplary figures who love the cooperative. As long as you pay attention to collecting their exemplary deeds to educate the members, it can play a great role. This is what the Xinke First Agricultural Cooperative does.

　　Member Zhang Maoshun raised thirteen cattle in the cooperative. One day in April, a calf fell ill. It suddenly fell down while eating grass on the mountain. Coincidentally, it was raining heavily at this time. Zhang Maoshun quickly called two members to carry the calf back to his house. He burned a fire for the calf to roast. At night, Zhang Maoshun covered the calf with his only quilt, and let his wife and children spend the night under a mosquito net. Early the next morning, he asked his wife to find cattle medicine for the calf to eat. The calf was finally cured.

　　The management committee praised Zhang Maoshun in each production team and educated the members to take care of the draught cattle. Many members were deeply moved by Zhang Maoshun's cooperative-loving behavior and expressed that they would learn from Zhang Maoshun and strive to be exemplary members. Many people who were originally unwilling to raise cattle are now not only raising cattle with peace of mind but also raising them very well. Among the seventeen cattle keepers in the whole cooperative, ten models like Zhang Maoshun quickly appeared.

　　Ma Zhenglin, the director of the cooperative, deeply realized the good effect of this working method of praising good people and good deeds. He often went to the teams to understand the situation during the day, and in the evening he took the loudspeaker and went around shouting, praising the good people and good deeds discovered that day. In this way, a mass movement of loving the cooperative was naturally launched in the cooperative. Loving the cooperative has become a common practice. If the mouth of the field is broken, or there is a leak, someone will fix the mouth or the leak before the water manager goes to check it; if the corn is blown down by the wind, someone will quickly straighten it up and add soil...

　　More and more advanced figures are appearing, and the cooperative is becoming more and more vigorous.

　　只是因为他们善于依靠社员群众
　　梁晓然　黄克成　方杨经
    湘西苗族自治州花垣县新科第一农业生产合作社是在执行“民主办社”方针上做得比较好的一个社。这个社没有工作组经常帮助，只是由于社干部善于深入群众，把群众当中的积极因素发动起来，终于克服了种种困难，把社办好了，获得了增产46.16％，95％的社员增加收入的成绩。
    从忙乱中走出来
    花垣县麻栗场乡新科第一农业社是今年春天建立起来的，秋季升为高级社。
    今年二、三月间，社刚建成，社里采取的临时调工办法满足不了集体生产的要求。工作质量低，生产工具无人照管，队和队之间互相怀疑，社员和社员之间争分吵咀、闹不团结，有的队甚至两、三天不出工，直接影响着生产计划的完成。那时，社主任麻正林忙得到处打转，顾了这个队就顾不了那个队。为了克服工作中的忙乱现象，社管理委员会议便研究制定了劳动定额。4月间种玉米，当时规定四里路远挑七挑大粪算一个定额。第三队有五个社员挑了半天，就累得喘不过气来，不愿再出工了。麻正林在工地发现了这个情况，便亲自试挑了一天，不松不紧，只能挑五挑。修改了定额，大家复工了。又一次，麻正林参加第二队种玉米，发现了两个问题：一个是耙土的定额太松。他只耙半天土，就达到了一个定额
  （三亩）。一个是分工协作处理不当。当晚麻正林召开了管委会。将订得不够合理的定额作了修正。不合理的定额，在半年来的执行过程中，先后修订了十九次。
    定额比较合理了，但工作质量还是不能保证。社主任麻正林处理这个问题的办法，是耐心帮助社员改正错误。第二队有的女社员最爱争分。他们在薅草的时候，专拣包得松的活干，对包得稍紧的丘块，即使是在自己的责任区内，也不过问，工作质量也不好。有一天，社主任在工地上发现了她们这种不顾质量的行为，晚上就有意识地去和一个争工分的女社员“摆龙门阵”，慢慢地给她讲清单纯争分不顾质量的危害性。那个女社员很难过，第二天晚上便自动地在会上进行了检讨，教育了其他几个女社员。第七队有一个社员平日爱打小算盘，割牛草也要渗水和石头，监委会主任黄学仁采用了社主任教育争工分的女社员的办法，使他在劳动态度上有了转变。这个队平日有几个最爱沾小便宜、不顾工作质量的社员，因为受了这个社员的影响，也转变过来了。
    这样，广大社员的劳动热情逐渐高涨，出勤率由原来的65％上升到经常保持在90％左右，劳动时间也由每天六小时增加到九小时。
  零用钱的问题解决了
    5月初，生产开始走上正轨，新的问题又发生了。每逢场期，社员们便纷纷向社里借钱买日用必需品，社里研究了解决这一问题的办法，决定发展多种经营。他们找出全社全年能集体经营的副业有养猪、养鸭、种蔬菜等。光组织社员帮助粮库加工大米一项，就得了人民币三百多元，初步解决了部分社员缺零用钱的问题，大大地鼓舞了社员们开展多种经营的积极性。管委会还组织社员开展家庭副业，要大家多养猪、养鸡、挖药材、捞虾子来增加家庭收入。可是，在养鸡问题上又碰到了难题：这地方历史上流传下来的“鸡是雷公菩萨，鸡粪不能下田下土，手摸到鸡要遭雷打”的神话，深刻地印在苗族农民的脑子里，很多社员反对养鸡，麻正林知道这是有关本民族风俗习惯的改革问题，不能硬性地勉强要大家养鸡。他便深入到已经养过鸡的社员龙德二、王家寿、麻兴林等家去总结养鸡的好处。龙德二告诉他：今年养了两只母鸡，孵了三次小鸡，卖了二十二只小鸡，得十五元五角，解决了油、盐和零用钱的问题，现在家中还有十八只小鸡，准备秋后卖掉，换喂一头小猪。麻正林再度召开了管委会，用这些生动的事实打通了社委的思想。会后，社委们分头用实际事例动员群众，传统的迷信思想被打破了，社员们纷纷养鸡。去年只有六户养鸡，今年已有六十五户养鸡。社员零用钱的困难得到了解决。
      掀起抗旱高潮
    插秧过后，整整两个多月没有下雨。到7月间，全社已有二百多亩稻田遭旱脱水，部分有手工业收入的社员，想出外谋生。很多贫困社员则感到心有余而力不足，唉声叹气。社里的迷信靠天思想逐渐抬头。个别党员、团员和骨干分子，也动摇了，空喊抗旱，不积极想办法。眼看禾苗快要枯死，抗旱保苗成了全社当时最突出的战斗任务。
    第五队队长龙竹连和社委龙金生二人，领导全队社员，费了三天时间，在山腰上架了一条半里多路长的水枧（引水槽），引出了山上的凉水，使十多亩行将枯死的禾苗得救了。黄学仁等从第五队这件事得到了启发，他想到第七队附近张母冲也有一股凉水能够利用，可以灌溉大山一带的三十多亩田。于是他到第七队去和第七队的社员商量。第七队的社员非常拥护他的主张。
    但是第七队架枧抗旱的合理化建议没有被管委会通过，社主任麻正林的心情非常沉重。他感到如不想尽一切办法挽救禾苗，就会造成农业社的严重减产。他仔细看了第五队架枧的地方的地形和水源，又仔细比较了第七队要求架枧的地方的水源和地形，肯定第七队修水枧也一定能够成功。他决定独立负责支持第七队修水枧，回头再想法说服其他社委。黄学仁得到了社主任的支持，回到队里，便领导社员们夜以继日地在山岭上架枧。由于劳累过度，他病了，晕倒了，仍然带病坚持工作。捆竹枧的草用完了，黄学仁把自己垫床铺的草拿来用。在他的带动下，社员们的情绪更加昂扬，他们喊出了“不架通水枧不下山”的口号。经过七天七夜的紧张劳动，水枧终于架成功了。一股大流泉，通过起伏曲折的竹枧，源源不断地流到稻田里。原来有悲观情绪的人，受到了一次生动的教育，情绪安定下来了。社里立即出现了群众性的抗旱高潮。经过二十多天的顽强斗争，旱灾终于被战胜了。
    “尾巴队”变先进队
    第五生产队原来的工作比较薄弱，缺乏骨干。生产队长龙竹连和管理委员龙金生办好社的决心虽然大，但缺乏经验，办法不多，工作中常碰钉子。有一次，队的记分员石宗文（富裕中农）闹别扭，有两天没有记工分，引起社员在会上大吵大闹。队长龙竹连急得满头大汗，两个人都去找社主任，一个要交记工簿坚决不干，一个向社主任要办法。社主任鼓励龙竹连大胆放手地干，还告诉他在工作中要注意找依靠力量，发现和培养积极分子，他们就注意培养最贫困、最忠实而劳动又好的龙德二、汪大全、石把刚、龙巴哥等人。一次收工的时候，有些社员把锄头、粪桶等十多件农具丢在地里，龙金生就连挑带拿把它们收拾回来。在队里的大会上，队长龙竹连表扬了龙金生等的爱社模范行为，从此，队里的正气渐渐抬头，情况开始好转。
    他们又培养了龙佩唐、龙佩择兄弟代替记分员石宗文的工作，由于文化水平低，开始账记得不好。队长龙竹连决心培养他弟兄俩成为自己工作中的助手，于是就到龙佩唐家和他住在一起，谈了三个晚上，对他进行了细致的阶级教育和团结大家搞好生产的教育，龙佩唐兄弟终于被发动起来了。在一次队员会上，他俩主动检查了自己的缺点，并向社员保证要学习算账技术，提高记账能力，记好工账，这个队的积极分子已经由四人增加到十一人。社里所布置的生产任务，队员们都能够按期完成或超额完成。春天种玉米，第五队总是最后完成任务的“尾巴队”。秋天收谷子，情况就变了，第五队比各队提前五天完成任务，并调出力量支援了兄弟队。
  好人好事越来越多
    社员当中，有不少爱社的模范人物，只要注意把他们的模范事迹搜集起来教育社员，可以起到很大的作用。新科第一农业社就是这样做的。
    社员张茂顺饲养社内十三头牛。4月的一天，一条小牛病了，在山上吃草时忽然倒了下去，碰巧这时候落大雨。张茂顺赶忙喊了两个社员，把小牛抬回他家，自己烧了火给小牛烤。夜里张茂顺又把自己仅有的一床被子和小牛伙着盖，让老婆孩子盖蚊帐过夜。第二天清早，就叫老婆去寻牛药给小牛吃。小牛终于给治好了。
    管委会在各个生产队表扬了张茂顺，教育社员爱护耕牛。很多社员深为张茂顺的爱社行为所感动，表示要向张茂顺学习，争取做个模范社员。许多人原来不愿养牛，现在不只安心养牛而且养得很好。全社十七个养牛员，像张茂顺一样的模范，很快就出现了十个。
    社主任麻正林深刻体会到表扬好人好事这种工作方法的良好效果，他经常白天到各队去了解情况，晚上就拿着广播筒到处去喊，表扬当天发现的好人好事。这样，一个群众性的爱社运动，在社里很自然地开展起来了。爱社已形成风气。田里的月口塌了，或是有了漏洞，不等管水员去检查，就有人把月口或漏洞整好了；玉米被风吹倒了，很快就有人把它扶正，培好土……
    先进人物越来越多，社里越来越生气勃勃。
