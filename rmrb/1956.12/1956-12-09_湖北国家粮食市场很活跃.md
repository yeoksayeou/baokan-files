　　Hubei's National Grain Market is Very Active

　　(Reported by this newspaper) The national grain market in Hubei Province is showing great activity. According to incomplete statistics from 860 markets in 51 counties, including Macheng, Xiaogan, Songzi, and Xiangyang, over 16,580,000 *jin* of various grains were put on the market in just 25 days in November. Of this amount, in addition to 750,000 *jin* transacted by farmers for trading and variety exchange, 15,830,000 *jin* of surplus grain were purchased by the state on behalf of the government.

　　During the period when the markets were open, due to vigorous publicity about the policy that surplus grain could be freely disposed of after the completion of the grain procurement tasks, many farmers' ideological concerns about grain issues have been basically eliminated, and they have flocked to the markets to conduct transactions. The First Agricultural Cooperative of Sanhejie Township in Wuchang County declared 1,500 *jin* of wheat brought to the market as grain for circulation. After the market staff publicized the policy, they sold it all at the transaction price and did not require circulation certificates. Chen Xiuzhang, a member of the Eighth Agricultural Cooperative of Liuxing Township in Anlu County, originally planned to exchange his surplus grain for universal grain coupons for storage. After seeing the active market situation with buying and selling, he immediately sold 20 *jin* of rice in the market and exchanged it for 10 *jin* of glutinous rice.

　　Because the regulations stipulating that sellers do not need certificates and buyers are not limited in quantity and do not need coupons were implemented, many grain-deficient households also bought the grain they needed in the market. For example, Jiang Guozhong, a grain-deficient member of the Chonghua First Agricultural Cooperative in Yanghe Township, Xiaogan County, excitedly said after buying 218 *jin* of staple and coarse grains at the Chen Dian market in Anlu: "The food for people and the feed for pigs are solved. I won't go to the director to ask for supplies anymore." Since many markets were established, the supply of bran has also increased significantly due to active transactions, and the price has dropped from four cents per *jin* to about two cents per *jin*, which has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of farmers for raising pigs.

　　In order to facilitate farmers' grain adjustment, invigorate the market, and continue to absorb social surplus grain to support disaster areas, Hubei Province's markets are starting to develop, and it is expected that they will reach about 2,000 by the end of December. (Li Jintang)

### 湖北国家粮食市场很活跃

　　湖北国家粮食市场很活跃
    本报讯　湖北省的国家粮食市场，显得十分活跃。据麻城、孝感、松滋、襄阳等五十一个县的八百六十个市场的不完全统计，在11月份短短的二十五天中，即上市各种粮食一千六百五十八万余斤。其中除农民交易和品种兑换七十五万余斤以外，交易剩余粮食还代国家收进一千五百八十三万余斤。
    在市场开放期间，由于各地大力地宣传了粮食征购任务完成以后余粮可以自由处理的政策，许多农民在粮食问题上的思想顾虑已基本解除，并纷纷到市场进行交易。武昌县三河界乡第一农业社，把挑到市场上的一千五百斤小麦说成是周转粮。通过市场工作人员宣传政策以后，他们全部按交易价格出售，不要周转证。安陆县刘兴乡第八农业社社员陈修章，原来计划把余粮换成通用粮票保存起来，当他看到市场有买有卖的活跃情况以后，立即到市场出售了二十斤大米，并换回糯米十斤。
    由于贯彻了卖者不要证明、买者不限量不要票证的规定，不少缺粮户在市场上也买到了自己必需的粮食，如孝感县扬河乡重化第一农业社缺粮社员姜国忠，在安陆陈店市场买到主杂粮二百一十八斤后，兴奋地说：“人的口粮、猪的饲料都解决了，再不找主任闹供应了。”许多市场成立以后，由于交易活跃，糠麸上市也显著增加，价格由四分钱一斤降为两分左右一斤，大大地刺激了农民养猪的积极性。
    为了便利农民进行粮食有无调剂、活跃市场，以及继续吸收社会余粮支援灾区，湖北省的市场正在开始发展，预计到12月底将发展到两千个左右。　（李金堂）
