    A Large Cotton Boll with Seventeen Sections
    In the cotton fields of the Jiangsu Province State-run Fengxian Mechanical Farm, an unusually large cotton boll appeared. It had eleven sections around the outside and six sections in the middle, totaling seventeen sections. Normally, a cotton boll only has three to six sections. This large cotton boll weighed 4 qian, 1 fen, and 7 li net.
    The Fengxian Mechanical Farm plans to sow the seeds from this large cotton boll separately next year in order to conduct experiments and research. (Xinhua News Agency)

    一朵大棉花十七个瓤
    江苏省国营奉贤机械农场棉田里，出现了一朵特别大的棉花。它周围有十一个瓤，中间还有六个瓤，共十七个瓤；而通常一朵棉花只有三个到六个瓤，这朵大棉花净重四钱一分七厘。
    奉贤机械农场准备明年把这朵大棉花种籽单独播种，以便加以试验研究。　　　　（新华社）
