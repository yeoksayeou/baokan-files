　　Shaanxi Makes Plans for Scientific Management of Farmland Irrigation

　　The Shaanxi Province Irrigation Management Work Conference recently held decided to strengthen the experimental research work of farmland irrigation.

　　The conference determined that in 1957, 60% to 80% of the area planted with cotton, corn and other crops in Shaanxi Province's irrigation areas would implement ditch irrigation, all wheat, millet, and foxtail millet crops would implement small furrow irrigation, and 60% to 70% of the rice area would implement the new method of paddy flooding. The province's original seven irrigation experiment stations (points) will be supplemented by four new ones in 1957. Each station (point) must continue to verify the irrigation system, water demand patterns, and irrigation techniques of local crops such as grain, cotton, and vegetables, and begin to study the special problems in local farmland irrigation. The experiment stations in the Jinghui and Zhinü irrigation areas will study methods for preventing and controlling soil salinization. The experiment stations (points) in the Weihui, Luohui and other canal irrigation areas will study the irrigation system and irrigation methods in mechanized farming areas. The management agencies of the province's twenty state-owned canals must focus on helping agricultural cooperatives conduct simple comparative irrigation experiments, quickly improve the flow measurement network within the canal system, and measure the irrigation quota of various crops under different conditions. The management agencies of the Jinghui, Weihui, Luohui, and Zhinü canals must also carry out testing of the sediment content of the canals.

　　The conference also studied the experience of promoting advanced irrigation technology in various irrigation areas across the province this year, discussed specific issues related to irrigation systems and irrigation techniques in various places, and formulated a development plan for the irrigation management of state-owned canals throughout the province.

　　The state-owned canal irrigation area in Shaanxi Province totals more than 2.8 million mu. In the past, due to many shortcomings in irrigation methods, the soil in a few irrigation areas gradually deteriorated, and the crops planted decreased year by year. After Soviet experts conducted on-site inspections and proposed improvement methods, some irrigation areas established irrigation experiment stations (points) from 1953 to verify and promote advanced irrigation techniques from inside and outside the province.

　　Zhejiang Holds Reservoir and Pond Observation Meeting

　　The Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Department recently held a reservoir and pond observation meeting in Zhuji County to promote the construction of water conservancy projects in various places this winter and next spring.

　　Four hundred and thirty-six cadres and agricultural cooperative members from fifty-six counties visited the Bailonggang and other four reservoirs and Dapotang and other six ponds built in Zhuji County last winter and this spring, and learned about the construction process, maintenance status, and impact on agricultural production of these reservoirs and ponds.

　　According to the preliminary plan of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Department, more than 3,800 reservoirs will be built in mountainous and hilly areas throughout the province this winter and next spring. The land area of mountainous and hilly areas accounts for 71% of the province's total land area, and the grain output accounts for 67% of the province's total. In order to resist the threat of drought and ensure increased agricultural production, these areas have built a large number of reservoirs and ponds in recent years. From 1954 to 1956 alone, 1,465 reservoir projects were completed, providing and improving irrigation conditions for nearly 2 million mu of farmland. The Bailonggang and other reservoirs visited by the representatives at this observation meeting benefited more than 3,900 mu of farmland.

　　把农田水利工作做得更好些
　  陕西作出科学管理农田灌溉的规划
    最近举行的陕西省灌溉管理工作会议，决定加强农田灌溉的试验研究工作。
    这次会议确定，1957年陕西省各灌溉区的棉花、玉米等作物60％到80％的面积实行沟灌，小麦、糜子、谷子等作物全部实行小畦灌溉，水稻60％到70％的面积实行新法泡田。全省原有七个灌溉试验站（点），1957年内还要新建四个。各站（点）都要继续验证当地粮食、棉花、蔬菜等作物的灌溉制度、需水规律和灌溉技术，并且着手研究当地农田灌溉中的特殊问题。泾惠和织女两渠灌溉区的试验站，要研究当地土壤盐渍化的防治办法。渭惠、洛惠等渠灌溉区的试验站（点），要研究机耕区的灌溉制度和灌溉方法。全省二十个国营渠道的管理机构都要有重点地帮助农业社进行简单的对比性灌溉试验，并且迅速健全渠系以内的测流网，测定各种作物在不同条件下的灌水定额。泾惠、渭惠、洛惠、织女四渠的管理机构还要进行渠道含沙量的测验工作。
    这次会议还研究了今年全省各灌溉区推广先进灌溉技术的经验，讨论了各地有关灌溉制度和灌溉技术的具体问题，并且制定了全省国营渠道灌溉管理发展规划。
    陕西省的国营渠道灌溉面积共有两百八十多万亩。过去由于灌溉方法有许多缺点，少数灌溉区的土壤逐渐恶化，种植的农作物逐年减产。经过苏联专家实地考察和提出改进办法以后，部分灌溉区从1953年起建立灌溉试验站（点），验证和推广省内外的先进灌溉技术。

　  浙江举行水库和山塘观摩大会
    浙江省水利部门最近在诸暨县举行水库和山塘的观摩大会，推动各地今冬明春的兴修水利工作。
    来自五十六个县的四百三十六个干部和农业社社员，参观了诸暨县去冬今春建成的白龙岗等四个水库和大坡塘等六个山塘，了解了这些水库和山塘的兴建过程、养护情况和对农业生产的作用。
    根据浙江省水利部门的初步规划，今冬明春全省山区和丘陵地区将兴修水库三千八百多座。山区和丘陵地区的土地面积占全省土地总面积的71％，粮食产量占全省的67％。为了抗御干旱威胁，保证农业增产，几年来这些地区已经兴修了大批水库和山塘。仅从1954年到1956年，就有一千四百六十五座水库工程完工，使近两百万亩农田得到了和改善了灌溉条件。这次观摩大会代表们参观的白龙岗等水库，有三千九百多亩农田受益。
