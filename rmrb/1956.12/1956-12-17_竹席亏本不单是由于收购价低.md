Letter from Anqing Daily Necessities Wholesale Station of Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative: After reading the article "Coercion and High-Handedness" published in your newspaper on October 30, we criticized our station regarding the bamboo mat purchasing issue. We do have many shortcomings in this regard. However, the situation reflected in the article is not entirely true.

The purchasing price of bamboo mats has recently been adjusted. However, the losses incurred by the bamboo mat cooperatives are not solely due to the low purchasing price in the past. Because bamboo mats are essentially a sideline product, the production cooperative organizes it as a specialized industry, increasing non-productive expenses by 25%. In addition, specialized wages are higher than sideline wages, which greatly increases the cost of bamboo mats.

The bamboo mat production cooperative went to Shanghai to promote bamboo mats and requested our station to issue a letter of introduction. It was certainly wrong of us not to issue it. However, the statement in the article that "Anqing Daily Necessities Wholesale Station, through the Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Shanghai Working Group, colluded with the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative General Office's Shanghai Daily Necessities Wholesale Station to not approve their prices and prevent merchants from buying their mats, ultimately forcing the bamboo mat cooperative to transport the mats back and sell them to the Anqing Daily Necessities Wholesale Station at a painful price of 9.35 yuan per mat" is completely untrue.

### 竹席亏本不单是由于收购价低

    竹席亏本不单是由于收购价低
    安徽省供销合作社安庆日用杂品批发站来信说：我们读了你报10月30日刊载的“强行霸道”一文以后，对我站有关竹席收购问题进行了批评，我们在这方面是有许多缺点的。但是文中所反映的情况，也非完全属实。
    竹席的收购价格最近已经调整。但是竹席社亏本的问题，并不单纯由于过去收购价偏低。因为竹席本是一种副业产品，生产联社把它当专业来组织，增加了25％的非生产性开支，加以专业工资高于副业工资，这就大大地增高了竹席成本。
    竹席生产社到上海推销竹席，要求我站发给介绍信，我们没有发给，当然是不对的。但是文内说“安庆日用杂品批发站又通过安徽省供销合作社驻沪工作组，串通全国供销合作社总社上海日用杂品批发站不给他们核价，不许席商买他们的席子，最后，迫使竹席社不得不把席子运回，忍痛以每条九元三角五分的价格卖给安庆日用杂品批发站”这一点全非事实。
