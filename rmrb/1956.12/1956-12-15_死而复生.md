Resurrected from the Dead
    The Highway Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Transportation Department sent a registered letter to engineer Li Changchun, who was receiving treatment at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College. Unexpectedly, it was returned with five large characters written on it: "This person has died."
    The Highway Bureau was greatly shocked and immediately made a long-distance phone call to inquire. The hospital replied that the patient's condition had improved.
    A person has been resurrected from the dead. Who is the "judge" at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Beijing Medical College arbitrarily deciding on patients' life and death?

    死而复生
    内蒙古交通厅公路局给在北京医学院第二附属医院治病的李长春工程师寄去双挂号信一件，不料退了回来，信上写着五个大字：“此人已死亡”。
    公路局大吃一惊，急忙打长途电话询问，院方答复是病人的病况已经好转。
    一个人死而复生了。不知道北京医学院第二附属医院哪位“判官”在任意判决病人的生死存亡？
