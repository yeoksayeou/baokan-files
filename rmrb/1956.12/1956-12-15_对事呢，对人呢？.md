    On Matters, or on People?
    Some people think that rectification of the cooperatives mainly involves "rectifying" the cooperative cadres. It seems that as long as the cooperative cadres are "rectified," the work of rectifying the cooperatives is considered complete.
    Some people think that rectification of the cooperatives is about digging up shortcomings and investigating errors. It seems that as long as the shortcomings and errors in the cooperative's work are "dug up" and "investigated," the work of rectifying the cooperatives is considered complete.
    Facts have proven that doing so not only cannot effectively improve work, but also will dampen the confidence and enthusiasm of the broad masses of grassroots cadres and cooperative members.
    Is the rectification of cooperatives focused on matters or on people? All the affairs of the cooperatives are done by people. Checking and rectifying the work in the cooperatives inevitably involves the cadres in the cooperatives. In this sense, rectifying the cooperatives is both about matters and about people. However, dealing with people is definitely not about "rectifying" people. Even when criticizing errors, it is about curing the sickness to save the patient. Dealing with people is not the goal; doing things better is the goal. Shortcomings and errors in work naturally need to be checked, and the advantages and achievements in work should also be summarized. More importantly, help the cooperative cadres analyze the experiences and lessons in their work. And all this is to achieve one general purpose: to protect and promote the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and cooperative members, so that they can unite as one and run the cooperatives better.
    When we talk about the past, it is not to chew on the dregs, but to absorb nutrition, and to move towards a bright future in a healthier way.

### 对事呢，对人呢？

    对事呢，对人呢？
    有些人认为整社主要是“整”社干部。似乎只要把社干部“整”一下，整社工作就算做好了。
    有些人认为整社就是挖缺点、查错误。似乎只要把办社工作里的缺点、错误“挖”出来、“查”出来，整社工作就算做好了。
    事实证明：这样做的结果，不但不能有效地改进工作，而且会挫伤广大基层干部和社员群众前进的信心和积极性。
    整社是对事呢，还是对人？合作社的一切事都是人做的，检查和整顿合作社里的工作，必然涉及社里的干部。在这个意义上说，整社既是对事，也是对人。但是，对人决不是“整”人，即使在批判错误的时候，也是治病救人。对人不是目的，把事做得更好才是目的。工作中的缺点和错误，自然要检查，工作中的优点和成绩也应该总结。更重要的是帮助社干部分析工作中的经验教训。而这一切都是为了达到一个总的目的：保护和发扬干部和社员的社会主义积极性，使他们团结一心，把合作社办得更好。
    当我们谈论过去的事情的时候，并不是为了咀嚼渣滓，而是为了吸取营养，更健康地奔向远大的未来。
