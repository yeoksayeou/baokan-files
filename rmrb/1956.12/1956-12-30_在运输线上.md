    On the Transportation Line
    Busy Freight Traffic on the Yingtan-Yongan Section
    In the fifty-four days since the Yingtan-Yongan section of the Yingxia Railway began handling freight in November, 2,054 tons of industrial products, including cotton cloth, cotton yarn, flour, gasoline, kerosene, medicines, cigarettes, and shoes and socks, have been transported from various places to Yongan Station. The amount of local specialties such as timber, bamboo, dried bamboo shoots, rosin, turpentine, and rough-edged paper transported from Yongan Station has reached 7,564 tons.
    Before railway transportation, large quantities of timber and bamboo from the mountainous areas of Fujian could not be transported out for years, accumulating in piles and becoming worthless. At the same time, the industrial products needed by the people in the mountainous areas were scarce and expensive due to transportation difficulties.
    Segmented and Combined Transport
    In the upper reaches of the Jialing River in Sichuan Province, between Guangyuan and Nanchong, segmented and combined transportation methods are being used to accelerate the turnover rate of wooden boats and save transportation costs.
    In the dry winter and spring seasons in the upper reaches of the Jialing River, the carrying capacity of many large wooden boats is generally reduced by 30%, which is a significant waste. Segmented and combined transport involves unified allocation and use of vessels based on the characteristics of the numerous tributaries of the Jialing River and the varying water depths of each section, in order to fully utilize the carrying capacity of each boat.
    Currently, fifty smaller wooden boats are responsible for transportation in the shallow water section from Guangyuan to Zhaohua, while the other 330+ larger boats in Yanyuan Port are responsible for transportation between Zhaohua and Nanchong. This reform can increase the carrying capacity by 700 tons per month and save 3,600 yuan in freight costs per month. At the same time, the turnover rate of boats can be increased by 15%. In the past, a round trip from Guangyuan to Langzhong took twenty-two days, now it only takes eighteen days. Below Langzhong, some boats that are not fully loaded are implementing combined loading, which enables some boats to return earlier, and the trial results are also very good. (Xinhua News Agency)
    Direct Dispatch
    Since the Qinghai Provincial Department of Commerce strengthened its transportation work, the market supply situation has initially improved. In early December, they had already transported 350 tons of cotton accumulated in Hekou and some of the cloth needed urgently for the New Year and Spring Festival to Xining. Dozens of types of goods most urgently needed by consumers in winter, such as cloth, hats, shoes, scarves, as well as chemical raw materials that are sensitive to freezing and fresh vegetables that are easily perishable, will also be successively transported to Xining.
    The state-owned commercial departments in Qinghai Province have also changed the long-standing roundabout dispatch to direct dispatch, which has greatly accelerated the circulation of goods. Department stores, knitwear, and cultural supplies accumulated in Hekou no longer need to go through Xining and can be directly dispatched to various counties and meet consumers. Now, large carts running between Hekou and various counties are endless, with an average of fifty to eighty tons of goods such as cotton clothes, cotton trousers, socks, and enamel basins delivered to consumers every day.
    Loading and Unloading Directly onto Vehicles
    The Chongqing Railway Bureau adopted the suggestions of Soviet experts, which significantly reduced the accumulation of goods at Chongqing Railway Station.
    Due to capacity limitations, less-than-carload (LCL) freight at Chongqing Railway Station could not be transported out even after being in the station for more than ten days. The amount of grain accumulated at the station once reached 90,000 bags, and there were still dozens of carloads of grain that could not be unloaded. Based on this situation, Soviet expert Yushkevich suggested that the railway bureau should not use the station as a warehouse, and should try to shorten the time goods stay at the station to increase the station's throughput capacity. Based on the suggestions of the Soviet experts, the station organized manpower to first rush to transport the accumulated LCL freight waiting to be shipped, and at the same time adopted the method of loading LCL freight directly onto vehicles without it touching the ground. The consignors transported the goods directly to the loading line on the specified date to load them onto the vehicles. For bulk grain transported to Chongqing, the method of unloading directly onto vehicles without it touching the ground was also adopted, and the ninth track near the river was designated as a special line for unloading grain.

    在运输线上
    鹰潭永安段货运繁忙
    鹰厦铁路鹰潭—永安段自11月份办理货运以来的五十四天中，从各地运到永安车站的工业品，包括棉布、棉纱、面粉、汽油、煤油、药品、香烟和鞋袜等，已经有两千零五十四吨。由永安车站运出的木材、竹子、荀干、松香、松节油和毛边纸等多种土特产品，也有七千五百六十四吨。
    在没有铁路运输以前，闽中山区的大量木材和竹子等长年运不出去，积压成堆，不值钱；同时，山区人民需要的工业品，也由于运输困难、又缺又贵。
    分段运输和并载运输
    四川省嘉陵江上游广元到南充间，采取分段运输和并载运输办法，来加速木船运输的周转率和节省运输费用。
    嘉陵江上游每到冬、春两季枯水时节，许多大木船的载重量一般要减少30％，浪费很大。分段运输和并载运输，是根据嘉陵江支流较多，各段水流深浅不一的特点，统一调配使用船只，以便充分发挥每只船的载重能力。
    现在，广元到昭化一段浅水区，已经由五十只较小的木船担任运输，岩元港的其他三百三十多只大船担任昭化到南充间的运输任务。这一项改革，每月可以增加七百吨载重量，每月还能节省运费三千六百元，同时船只周转率能提高15％。过去广元到阆中来回运输一次需要二十二天，现在只要十八天。自阆中以下，一些没有装足载量的船，实行并载，能使一部分船提早返回，试行的效果也很好。（新华社）
    直线调运
    青海省商业厅所属各公司自加强了运输工作后，市场物资供应情况已经初步得到改善。12月上旬，他们已经把积压在河口的三百五十吨棉花和部分新年、春节所急需的布匹等运到西宁。冬季消费者最迫切需要的布匹、帽子、鞋子、围巾以及怕冻的化工原料、容易腐烂的新鲜蔬菜等数十类商品，也将陆续运进西宁。
    青海省国营商业部门还把长久沿袭的曲线调运改为直线调运，使商品的流转大大加快。积压在河口的百货、针织品、文化用品不必再经过西宁，就可以直接调到各县和消费者见面了。现在，奔驰在河口和各县之间的大板车络绎不绝，平均每日有五十吨到八十吨的棉衣、棉裤、袜子、搪瓷面盆等商品送到消费者手里。
    不落地装车卸货
    重庆铁路管理局采纳苏联专家建议，使积存在重庆火车站的货物显著减少。
    重庆火车站因为受通过能力的限制，零担货物进站十多天以后还运不出去，积存车站的粮食曾经达到九万包，还有几十个车皮的粮食卸不下来。苏联专家尤士克维奇根据这一情况，建议铁路管理局不要把车站当仓库使用，尽量缩短货物在车站停留的时间，提高车站的通过能力。根据苏联专家的建议，车站组织人力首先突击抢运了积存待运的零担货物，同时采取零担货不落地装车的办法。由货主在规定日期直接把货物运到装车线上装车；对运到重庆的大宗粮食也采用不落地卸车法，指定靠河的第九股道作为卸粮专用线。
