"Worker's Daily" and Hungary
Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States

The General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, Eugene Dennis, published an article entitled "'Worker's Daily' and Hungary" in the New York "Worker's Daily" on December 1. The full text is as follows:

If Hungary moves towards fascism, the cause of world peace and progress will be threatened

Huge changes are taking place in the world, and therefore huge changes are also taking place in the minds of all thoughtful people. Therefore, it is not surprising that "Worker's Daily" has changed its attitude towards many issues.

It is good that "Worker's Daily" has shown great initiative, responded quickly to events, and strived to break with past dogmatism. However, many readers and friends of "Worker's Daily" are becoming increasingly concerned about the editorial stance it has taken on certain major issues, especially the recent events in Hungary.

As I stated in a letter I wrote published in this newspaper on November 12, I share this deep concern. So, what is part of the reason why people are so worried?

The situation in Hungary is not only regrettable, but also extremely complex. Regardless of how people assess the transformation of events in Hungary after November 4, I believe that all Marxists will agree that if Hungary moves towards fascism, the cause of world peace and progress will be threatened. In that case, a new tinderbox of imperialism will be set up in the heart of Eastern Europe. No family in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa can escape the impact of this fatal consequence.

Bearing this in mind, it becomes very clear that Hungary is a touchstone that shows how to best promote the struggle for peace in a constantly changing world situation, how to best promote the true national interests of one's own country, and tests people's attitudes towards socialist countries and proletarian internationalism.

Hungarian reactionaries, in coordination with the US "liberation" policy, attempted to turn Hungary into a fascist powder keg

Let us examine some knowable facts. Some facts are still unclear—the editors of "Worker's Daily" are not clear, and I am not clear either. However, most Marxists can agree on some ironclad facts.

One fact is that the current situation in Hungary originated from serious distortions of Marxist doctrine and heinous violations of socialist principles, including: Stalin established an unjustifiable relationship between the Soviet Union and Hungary; the current Soviet leaders were initially apparently slow in correcting some of these mistakes; Rakosi and his gang even refused to correct their serious mistakes when the clock of history was one minute to midnight.

One fact is that the struggle in Hungary initially began as a mass movement demanding the restoration of democratic rights, improvement of people's living standards, and respect for Hungary's national sovereignty on the basis of equality and mutual benefit between socialist countries.

Another fact is that the remnants of the pro-Hitler Horthy regime, aided and abetted by the West, tried from the very beginning to shift this mass movement in the opposite direction. Because, in cooperation with the supporters of Dulles's "liberation" policy, they tried their best to turn Hungary into a fascist powder keg for imperialism to carry out new adventures in Eastern Europe.

These facts are very clear to most Marxists, and also to many non-Marxists.

However, when the intervention of counter-revolutionaries underwent a qualitative change, "Worker's Daily" lost its opportunity. "Worker's Daily" failed to realize that by November 4, the danger of a fascist coup d'état supported by the Dulles brothers was very clear and imminent, which in turn threatened the security of all people's democracies and the Soviet Union.

Before November 4, the editors of "Worker's Daily" correctly pointed out that Horthy exiles, implementers of the X Plan, "Free Europe" radio, etc. were all exploiting the situation in Hungary. But the editors underestimated the significance of the entry into Hungary of large numbers of the old Horthy Arrow Cross soldiers and 60,000 various other fascist secret agents and bandits who sneaked into Hungary through the Austrian border. Moreover, they also underestimated the significance of Cardinal Mindszenty's radio address on November 3, in which he called for the restoration of the "private property system" and the return of the church's former property, privileges, and political power—which is precisely what "Free Europe" radio was striving for, and at the same time Tildy and Nagy intended to absorb this cardinal into the new coalition government!

The "Worker's Daily" editorial department underestimated the fascist forces' conspiracy in Hungary, and therefore failed to recognize the necessity of the Soviet army's resolute action to aid Hungary

Due to underestimating the significance of these developments, "Worker's Daily" failed to draw this obvious conclusion: the threat of a fascist coup was imminent, thus making the resolute action taken by the Soviet Union on November 4 strictly necessary.

Things reached the point where a spokesperson for the newspaper's editorial department even put forward the argument: Since Stalin once falsely accused Tito of being a fascist, how do we know if there was a serious fascist danger in Hungary?

However, this argument was not taken seriously by Tito himself. On the contrary. Because even Tito, who can hardly be regarded as a "defender" of the Soviet Union and has his own plans in the current situation, also saw the "strict necessity" that forced the Soviet Union to take military action and the threat to world peace.

The Soviet leaders—just like the Marxists in China, Italy, France, etc.—have admitted that some of their previous views on Tito were wrong. But no one, especially those who call themselves Marxists, can conclude from this that the Soviet leaders are incapable of judging where and when there is a real and acute fascist danger. They certainly were not wrong about Hitler, Hirohito, Mussolini, Horthy, and Franco!

Is it incomprehensible that the Soviet Union—a multi-ethnic socialist country that sacrificed 20 million people in the war against the Axis powers—is particularly sensitive, even a little nervous, about the emergence of new fascist dangers in the post-war period, especially in areas that constitute a bridge between West Germany and its own borders?

To insist that everything the Soviet Union does is suspicious or wrong is a new dogmatism. We should recognize the Soviet Union's historical contribution to the struggle for peace, national liberation, and social progress

Another author of the "Worker's Daily" editorial, on the grounds of not being influenced by the Soviet Union's assessment, tried to justify his own suspicion that there was a serious fascist danger in Hungary. Indeed, in the past, we American Marxists were often inappropriately influenced by the views of Soviet Marxists. None of us want to uncritically accept the opinions of others again in this way, whether they are Soviet or from other countries.

In abandoning the old dogmatism that virtually said that everything the Soviet Union did could not be criticized, is it an improvement to ignore the fact that the Soviet Union is the first socialist country? Is this new dogmatism of insisting that everything the Soviet Union does is suspicious or wrong "seriously wrong?"

We American communists have made the mistake of not viewing the Soviet Union critically. But we have never made the mistake of viewing the Soviet Union through the eyes of American imperialists. We have always recognized its socialist role and achievements, and its historically significant contribution to the struggle for peace, national liberation, and social progress.

I believe that a truly independent Marxist position cannot be achieved by declaring separation from the ideology and party spirit of the working class.

On the contrary, this must be a class position—a position that is not influenced by the American big business, the State Department, and the editorial policy of "The New York Times."

It is good that the "Worker's Daily" editorial said that it is necessary to hold a new summit meeting to ease new international tensions and end the Cold War. But is this position undermined when the newspaper repeatedly asks whether the Soviet Union really intends to implement the resolutions of the 20th Congress and realize its October 30 declaration? Does this speculation, especially after the recent Warsaw-Soviet Treaty, help and comfort those inside and outside the government who say that the Soviet Union's "perfidy" makes a summit meeting or any other East-West meeting to end the Cold War useless?

The strength and continued existence of the socialist system is the best and main guarantee of peaceful coexistence

It is good that the editors of "Worker's Daily" wrote about realizing the possibility of long-term peaceful coexistence between capitalist and socialist countries that the people hope for. But is this hope placed on the goodwill of capitalist countries, including our country? Isn't this hope placed on the emergence of socialism as a powerful world system? The peaceful policies of the socialist system have received increasing support from a group of neutral countries and millions of working people in capitalist countries themselves. Isn't the continued existence of this system's strength the best and indeed the main guarantee of peaceful coexistence?

Yes, socialist countries have also made serious and harmful mistakes. But if we only pay attention to the mistakes while simultaneously diminishing or even negating the long-term and unwavering struggle of the socialist countries' governments for peace, diminishing or even negating the fact that, unlike any capitalist country's government, they openly and frankly admit their mistakes, and develop, progress, and grow in the struggle to correct mistakes and solve unprecedentedly complex problems, then would this be helpful to the struggle for coexistence?

What kind of American brand of Marxism is it to describe suggestions that fight against Wall Street's "liberation" crusaders and the X Plan program as "justification" for the socialist camp?

An editorial writer for "Worker's Daily" now argues that we should "no longer emphasize" the Hungarian issue and focus on American issues. This author seems to think that criticism of the November 5 "Worker's Daily" editorial is a "program of justification" for the socialist camp. But one might well ask, what kind of American brand of Marxism is it to describe suggestions aimed at promoting the struggle against Wall Street's "liberation" crusaders and the bipartisan (supported) North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the X Plan program as "justification?"

If some communists had a clearer view of the realities of American life, they would have been more easily able to understand what happened in Hungary. Take, for example, the role of some important sections of the Hungarian working class, who either actively participated in or passively supported this movement, the leadership of which was temporarily usurped by opposition and pro-fascist forces.

Some commentators seem to think that the nature of a movement depends entirely on whether it receives a certain degree of support from the working class. Does this mean that, "on domestic issues," in a very tense strike, the "return to work" movement should be supported by progressive forces—on the grounds that these scab movements, although instigated and led by employers, have "worker support?" Does this also mean that, if a large number of southern white workers are deceived into joining segregationists and lynching mobs—shouldn't the fighting workers resolutely take decisive measures to deal with the lynching mobs organized by the White Citizens' Council?

I have been very interested to read excerpts from an article published by Togliatti in "Unità" on November 6 entitled "Defending Freedom and Peace." In this article, the Italian Communist leader wrote:

"...If Hungary were ruled by an openly reactionary government, then what else would happen besides war? Border incidents, interventions, provocations would begin—all of which are the preparatory steps for an armed conflict that we are familiar with. Which international organizations would participate to try to establish order when the big imperialist countries, or some of them, light the spark to keep the flame burning?

"At this moment, we are asked to condemn the Soviet Union, to ask the Soviet Union to open the way for terror and war provocations in Hungary, and to condemn the Soviet Union if it does not listen to us.

"The Soviet Union's responsibility is to prevent the establishment of a haven for military provocations on its borders. Its responsibility, especially now, is to defend all the positions belonging to the peace front, and to prevent these positions from being destroyed or weakened in the slightest. This is not only its responsibility to itself or to the Eastern European countries, but also its responsibility to us and to the people of all countries. Compared with what is happening in the world now, the work of analyzing the so-called tragic events in Hungary is only of secondary importance. Let us try to understand this. Let us understand that here in Italy, our responsibility in this situation is to continue to unite in order to defend peace and stop the offensive of the reactionaries. We know the intentions of the reactionaries, and we also know what consequences they will cause if our divisions in the labor movement help them break through everything..."

The basic views on class antagonism and class struggle have not become obsolete, especially in the United States

The dangerous reality that our own economic royalists are fueling the Horthy fascists for world peace, although unclear to some editors of "Worker's Daily," should be equally clear to American Communists and to Togliatti.

No matter how complex the developments in other parts of the world are, we can well understand our responsibilities if we pay attention to domestic developments. Marx's basic ideas about class antagonism and class struggle have not become obsolete, especially not here in the United States. The sometimes forgotten enemy—monopoly capital—still needs us to fight against it and restrain it.

New guarantees for the possibility of long-term peaceful coexistence do exist, but the realization of this possibility still depends on the mass struggle, intervention, and solidarity of the people of all countries—including all the American people. The people's desire to build a "new America" can also lead to new democratic progress and higher standards; but this also requires organized mass struggle and wise, heroic working-class leadership—including the influence and initiative of a Marxist vanguard—to oppose the common enemy that threatens world peace.

No matter how much else may have changed since Lincoln's time or since the 20th Congress, it remains true that the closest relationship besides family should be the relationship of working people around the world uniting. Genuine American Marxists should now strive to strengthen this relationship more than ever before, thereby fighting against all who seek to weaken it. (Xinhua News Agency)

### “工人日报”和匈牙利

专栏：

    “工人日报”和匈牙利
    美国共产党总书记　尤金·丹尼斯
    美国共产党总书记尤金·丹尼斯在12月1日纽约“工人日报”上发表一篇题为“‘工人日报’和匈牙利”的文章。全文如下：
    如果匈牙利走向法西斯主义，世界和平和进步事业将受到威胁
    世界上正在发生着巨大的变化，因而，一切有思想的人们的心里也在发生着巨大的变化。因此“工人日报”对许多问题的态度有了改变原是不奇怪的。
    “工人日报”表现了巨大的首创精神，对事件的反应很快，并且努力同过去的教条主义决裂，这是好的。但是，“工人日报”的许多读者和朋友对于它就某些重大问题、特别是最近在匈牙利发生的事件所发表的社论的立场越来越关心起来。
    正如我在11月12日本报刊登的我所写的一封信中所说明的，这种深切的担心我也有同感。那末，人们这样担心的一部分原因何在呢？
    匈牙利的局势不仅是令人遗憾的，而且也是极为复杂的。不管人们对11月4日以后匈牙利事件的转变作怎样的估计，我相信所有的马克思主义者会同意这一点：如果匈牙利走向法西斯主义，世界和平和进步事业将受到威胁。那样一来，帝国主义的一个新的火绒箱将在东欧的心脏装置起来。美洲、欧洲、亚洲和非洲没有一个家庭能够摆脱这种致命的后果的影响。
    记住这一点，那就可以很清楚地看出：匈牙利是一块试金石，它显示怎样才能在不断变化的世界局势中最好地促进争取和平的斗争，怎样才能最好地促进自己国家的真正的民族利益，并且测验出人们对待社会主义国家和无产阶级国际主义的态度。
    匈牙利反动分子，同美国的“解放”政策相配合，企图把匈牙利变为法西斯火药库
    让我们研究一下某些可以了解的事实。有一些事实还不清楚——“工人日报”的编辑们不清楚，我也不清楚。但是，有一些铁的事实大多数马克思主义者是可以抱一致看法的。
    一个事实是：匈牙利目前的局势起源于对马克思主义学说的严重歪曲和对社会主义原则的可恶的破坏，其中有：斯大林建立了苏联和匈牙利之间的那种无法辩解的关系；苏联现在的领导在纠正这些错误中的一些错误方面最初显然做得很慢；拉科西和他的同伙们甚至在历史的时钟差一分钟就要敲夜里十二点的时候还拒绝改正他们的严重错误。
    一个事实是：匈牙利的斗争一开始的时候，是一个要求恢复民主权利、提高人民生活水平、在社会主义国家之间平等互利的基础上尊重匈牙利的国家主权的群众运动。
    还有一个事实是：受西方援助和唆使的亲希特勒的霍尔蒂政权的残余分子，从一开始就设法把这个群众运动转移到相反的方向去。因为，他们同杜勒斯的“解放”政策的支持者相配合，竭力想把匈牙利变成一个供帝国主义在东欧进行新冒险之用的法西斯火药库。
    这些事实对大多数马克思主义者是很清楚的，对许多非马克思主义者也很清楚。
    然而，当反革命分子的干涉发生了质变的时候，“工人日报”丧失了机会。“工人日报”没有认识到，到了11月4日的时候，一个受到杜勒斯兄弟支持的法西斯政变的危险已经看得很清楚和近在眼前了，而这又转而威胁着所有人民民主国家和苏联的安全。
    在11月4日以前，“工人日报”的编辑们正确地指出，霍尔蒂亡命者、X计划的执行人、“自由欧洲”电台等等都在利用匈牙利的局势。但是编辑们对旧霍尔蒂箭十字师的大批人马和六万名通过奥地利国境潜入匈牙利的各式各样其他法西斯特务和匪徒的进入匈牙利这件事的意义却估计不足。而且，他们也小看了红衣主教明曾蒂11月3日的广播演说的意义，他在演说中号召恢复“私有财产制度”和归还教会以前的财产、特权和政治势力——而这正是“自由欧洲”电台竭力主张、同时蒂尔迪和纳吉打算吸收这位红衣主教参加新的联合政府的时候！
    “工人日报”编辑部低估了法西斯势力在匈牙利的阴谋，因而不能认识苏军援助匈牙利的坚决行动的必要性
    由于低估了这些事态的意义，“工人日报”就没有能够得出这种明显的结论：一个法西斯政变的威胁已经迫在眉睫，因而使苏联在11月4日采取的坚决行动具有严格的必要性。
    事情达到了这种地步，以致这个报纸编辑部的一位发言人竟然提出这样的论调：由于斯大林曾经诬指铁托为法西斯分子，我们怎么知道在匈牙利是否发生了严重的法西斯危险呢？
    然而这种论据并没有受到铁托本人的重视。恰恰相反。因为甚至于连铁托，这个很难被看作是苏联的“辩护人”并且在目前的局势中有着他自己的打算的人，也看出来使苏联不得不采取军事行动的“严格的必要性”和对世界和平的威胁了。
    苏联的领导者——正如中国、意大利、法国等等国家的马克思主义者一样——已经承认他们以前对铁托的某些看法是错误的。但是任何人都不能，尤其是那些自称为马克思主义者的人更不能由这一点得出结论说：由此可见，苏联的领导者没有能力判断在什么地方、什么时候存在着真实而尖锐的法西斯危险。关于希特勒、裕仁、墨索里尼、霍尔蒂和佛朗哥，他们肯定是没有弄错的！
    如果苏联——在反对轴心国的战争中牺牲了二千万人的多民族社会主义国家——对于战后时期中新法西斯危险的出现，特别是在构成西德及其自己边境间桥梁的地区出现，特别敏感，甚至有点神经过敏，这难道是不可理解的吗？
    硬说苏联所做的一切都是值得怀疑或者是错误的，这是一种新教条主义。应认识到苏联对争取和平、民族解放和社会进步的斗争的历史贡献
    “工人日报”的社论的另一位作者，以不受苏联的估计的影响为理由，设法证明他自己怀疑在匈牙利是否有严重的法西斯危险的现实是有道理的。的确在过去，我们美国的马克思主义者常常不适当地受到苏联马克思主义者的观点的影响。我们中间谁也不愿意重新这样不加批判地接受他人的意见，不论是苏联的或是其他国家的。
    在抛弃那种实际上说苏联所做的一切都不能加以批评的老的教条主义的时候，忽视苏联是第一个社会主义的国家这一事实，难道是一种改进吗？硬说苏联所做的一切都是值得怀疑的、或者是错误的这种新的教条主义，是不是“大有毛病呢？”
    我们美国共产党人曾经犯过不以批评态度看待苏联的错误。但是我们从来没有犯过通过美帝国主义者的眼睛看待苏联的错误。我们始终认识到它的社会主义作用和成就，它对争取和平、民族解放和社会进步的斗争的具有历史意义的贡献。
    我认为，不能靠宣布脱离工人阶级观念形态和党性来达到真正独立的马克思主义立场。
    相反的，这必须是一种阶级立场——一种不受美国大企业、国务院和“纽约时报”编辑方针影响的立场。
    “工人日报”社论说有必要举行新的最高级会议来缓和新的国际紧张局势和结束冷战，这是好的。但是在报纸一再追问苏联是否真的打算执行第二十次代表大会的决议，实现它的10月30日的宣言的时候，这种立场不就受到破坏了吗？这种猜测，特别是在最近华沙—苏联条约以后还有这种猜测，难道不是帮助了并且安慰了政府内外那些说苏联的“背信弃义”使最高级会议或任何其他要结束冷战的东西方会议毫无用处的人士吗？
    社会主义体系的强大和继续存在，是和平共处的最好而且主要的保证
    “工人日报”编辑写到实现人民所希望的资本主义和社会主义国家在长时期内和平共处的可能性，这是好的。但是难道这种希望是寄托在包括我们国家在内的资本主义国家的善意上面的吗？难道这种希望不寄托在社会主义作为一个强大的世界体系出现上面吗？社会主义体系的和平政策已经得到了越来越大的中立国家的集团和资本主义国家本身千百万劳动人民的支持。这种体系的力量的继续存在不是和平共处的最好的、而且确实是主要的保证吗？
    是的，社会主义国家也犯了严重的和有害的错误。但是如果仅仅去注意错误而同时缩小或者甚至否定社会主义国家政府为了和平而进行的长期的、坚持不渝的斗争，缩小或者甚至否定这样一个事实：不像任何资本主义国家政府，他们公开而坦率地承认他们的错误，并且在纠正错误和解决史无前例的复杂问题的斗争中发展、进步和成长，那末，难道这样对于争取共处的斗争会有什么帮助吗？
    把那些同华尔街的“解放”十字军和X计划纲领作斗争的建议，说成是社会主义阵营的“辩解”，这是哪一种美国牌子的马克思主义呢？
    “工人日报”的一位社论作者现在主张我们应该“不再强调”匈牙利问题而集中注意美国问题。这位作者这样做似乎是认为对11月5日“工人日报”社论的批评是社会主义阵营“辩解的纲领”。但是人们很可以问，把目的在于推进对华尔街的“解放”十字军和两党（支持的）北大西洋公约组织、X计划纲领的斗争的建议说成是“辩解”，这是哪一种美国牌子的马克思主义呢？
    如果某些共产党人比较清楚地看到美国生活的现实，他们原会比较易于了解匈牙利所发生的事情的。就拿匈牙利工人阶级中的一些重要部分的作用作为例子来说吧，这部分人不是积极地参加就是消极地支持了这个领导权暂时为反对和亲法西斯势力所篡夺的运动。
    某些评论员似乎认为一个运动的性质完全决定于它是否得到工人阶级的一定程度的支持。这是不是说，“关于国内问题”，在一次很紧张的罢工中，“复工”运动应该得到进步力量的支持——理由是这些工贼运动虽然是由雇主鼓动和领导的，但是它们得到了“工人的支持”？这是不是还意味着，如果大量南部白种工人受骗参加种族隔离主义分子和用私刑的暴徒队伍的话——战斗的工人不应该毅然决然地采取坚决措施来对付白人公民委员会所组织的用私刑的暴徒？
    我曾经非常感兴趣地阅读了陶里亚蒂11月6日在“团结报”以“保卫自由与和平”为题发表的一篇文章中的几段摘录。这位意大利共产党领袖在这篇文章中写道：
    “……如果匈牙利被一个公开的反动政府统治的话，那末结果除了战争以外还会发生什么其他事情呢？边境事件、干涉，挑衅就会开始——所有这一切是我们所熟知的一场武装冲突的准备步骤。当大帝国主义国家，或者其中一些国家在燃起火星要使火焰烧下去的时候，哪一些国际组织会参加来设法建立秩序呢？
    “就在这个时候，我们被要求谴责苏联，要求苏联在匈牙利为恐怖和战争挑衅打开道路，而且如果苏联不听我们的话就谴责苏联。
    “苏联的责任是要防止在它的边境建立军事挑衅的庇护所。它的责任，特别是现在，是要保卫属于和平阵线的所有阵地，防止这些阵地遭到破坏或遭到丝毫的削弱。这不仅是它对自己或东欧各国应尽的责任，也是它对我们和各国人民应尽的责任。跟现在世界上正在发生的事情比较起来，分析所谓匈牙利目前的悲剧性事件的工作只占次要地位。让我们设法了解这一点。让我们了解在意大利这里，我们在这种局势下的责任是继续团结一致，以便保卫和平和阻止反动派的进攻。我们知道反动派的意图，我们也知道他们将引起什么结果，如果我们在劳工运动中的分歧助长他们突破一切的话……”
    关于阶级对立和阶级斗争的基本观点并没有过时，尤其是在美国
    我们自己的经济保皇党助长了霍尔蒂法西斯分子对世界和平的危险的现实性，虽然“工人日报”有些编辑不清楚，但是对美国共产党人和对陶里亚蒂应当是同样清楚的。
    不管世界其他地区的事态发展多么复杂，我们可以很好地了解我们的责任，如果我们注意国内的事态发展的话。马克思关于阶级对立和阶级斗争的基本观念并没有过时，尤其在美国这里并没有过时。对于有时被遗忘的敌人——垄断资本——仍然需要我们同它作斗争，对它加以约束。
    新的保证长期和平共处的可能性的确是存在的，但是这种可能性的实现仍然取决于各国人民——包括全体美国人民在内——的群众斗争、干与和团结。人民争取建立“新的美国”的愿望也能导致新的民主进展和提高标准；但是这也需要有组织的群众斗争和英明的、英勇的工人阶级的领导——包括一个马克思主义先锋队的影响和首倡精神——来反对威胁世界和平的共同敌人。
    不管林肯的时代以来或者第二十次代表大会以来可能有了多少其他的改变，但是除了家族以外的最紧密的关系应当是团结世界各地的劳动人民的关系，这一点仍然是真实的。美国真正的马克思主义者现在应当比过去任何时候更尽力来加强这种关系，从而跟所有设法削弱这种关系的人作斗争。（新华社）
