    On the Study of Chinese Peasant War History
　　Qi Xia
    China's feudal society experienced a long process. In this process, millions of peasants, in order to oppose the landlord class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression, carried out hundreds of uprisings and struggles, writing countless magnificent heroic epics. These uprisings and struggles of the peasants were the true driving force of the development of feudal society and are our people's glorious revolutionary tradition. The Party and Chairman Mao have fully and correctly estimated its role and significance, thus opening up a broad path for the study of Chinese peasant war history.
      Since the publication of Chairman Mao's "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" at the end of 1939, historians such as Guo Moruo, Fan Wenlan, Jian Bozan, and Lu Zhenyu have engaged in the study of peasant war history with great enthusiasm and interest. They either depicted the heroic deeds of peasant revolutions in the form of special essays or in certain chapters of their own works. In particular, Mr. Guo Moruo's famous essay "Commemorating the Tercentenary of the Jia Shen Year" had a wide impact and a good effect in both the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas.
    Since the national liberation, the study of peasant war history has developed vigorously. Roughly estimated, there are no fewer than seventy essays scattered in newspapers and periodicals. Collections of articles include "Collection of Essays on Chinese Peasant Uprisings" edited by the Historical Teaching Monthly Society, and "Collection of Essays on Chinese Peasant War History" by Zhao Lisheng and Gao Zhaoyi. In addition, several collections of materials on peasant war history have been compiled. Books such as "Historical Materials on Peasant Uprisings at the End of the Ming Dynasty" edited by Zheng Tianting, collect a lot of valuable archival materials. These cannot but be an achievement in historical research work in recent years.
    In general, the research achievements in peasant war history in recent years can be roughly divided into the following aspects.
    First, through the collection, collation, and excavation of scattered historical materials by the authors of the papers, and the study of new historical materials, we have gained a relatively rich knowledge of several national peasant wars and some large-scale peasant uprisings since the Qin and Han dynasties. For example, the Tang Dynasty peasant war led by Huang Chao had a very chaotic route of movement, but now, after sorting it out, there is a clear context. Problems such as the route of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang's northward march, the year of Zhai Rang's uprising in the Sui Dynasty, the deep relationship between Dou Jiande and the people of Hebei, the connection between Wang Xiaobo and Li Shun's uprising in the Song Dynasty and the "people who lost their jobs selling tea", whether Song Jiang conquered Fang La, and the exact location of Li Zicheng's martyrdom have also been revised, supplemented, and given accurate explanations. Some unknown deeds of uprisings, such as the uprising of refugees led by Liu Tong and Li Yuan in the Jingxiang mountainous area in the middle of the Ming Dynasty, and the uprising of Liu Liu and Liu Qi in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, have also been explored and revealed.
    Secondly, many papers have made certain analyses of the background and causes of each peasant uprising and peasant war. Generally speaking, the exposure of the tyranny of feudal rule and the corruption of the ruling group is quite sufficient as the reason for the outbreak of the uprising. There are also discussions on the land ownership system in various periods, especially the problem of land concentration, and the problem of the tax system, thus initially touching on the fact that feudal economic relations based on the feudal land ownership system have an internal connection with the outbreak of peasant wars. In addition, some papers can also conduct analysis based on specific materials, clarifying the reasons why a certain peasant war broke out in a certain area. This gives people the understanding that the outbreak of peasant war has its own unique and special features among the general and universal reasons. This kind of research is helpful for exploring the characteristics of the era of peasant uprisings and peasant wars.
    The issue that the peasant's revolutionary struggle is the real driving force for the advancement of feudal society is also the focus of exploration in recent years' research. Some papers use relatively rich materials to demonstrate certain aspects of this issue. For example, Tang Taizong's ideas of making concessions to peasants, the relative reduction of taxes and corvée in the early Tang Dynasty and the relatively widespread implementation of the equal-field system, as well as the resulting economic and cultural upsurge of the Tang Empire, have a blood-related relationship with the peasant war at the end of the Sui Dynasty; Ming Taizu's suppression of bureaucratic powerful forces and his emphasis on agricultural production, as well as the rapid recovery and development of the economy in the early Ming Dynasty, have an inseparable connection with the peasant war at the end of the Yuan Dynasty. These arguments are more in line with the actual situation and can therefore be affirmed. What role did the huge peasant war suppressed by the landlord ruling group, such as the peasant war at the end of the Tang Dynasty, play in historical development? Some papers believe that the economic development of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms played a promoting role in the peasant war at the end of the Tang Dynasty. Whether this can become a definitive conclusion remains to be discussed. But as an attempt, it is very worthy of promotion. Without attempts, no scientific department can discover new problems.
    Like other scientific research, there are also disputes over different opinions on certain issues in the study of peasant war history. For example, in certain war processes, how the peasant's war against feudal oppression was transformed into a war for feudal unification is a controversial issue. The peasant war at the end of the Sui Dynasty is the specific object of the dispute.
    Some articles, based on factual materials, explain that the peasant's spontaneous struggle against feudal oppression produced this internal contradiction due to their status as small producers, that is, they had the demand to oppose feudal oppression, but could not get rid of the shackles of the feudal system. In this way, although the peasant's resistance struggle at the end of the Sui Dynasty overthrew the feudal rule of the Sui Dynasty, it could not establish its own regime. Therefore, after the demise of the Sui Dynasty, aristocratic landlords seized the opportunity to try to establish a regime, and the leaders and upper-level elements of the peasant uprising army also unconsciously transformed to the road of feudal lords due to the limitations of the era, participating in the struggle for feudal rule. Thus, the nature of the war changed with the subversion of the Sui regime, from a war against feudal oppression to a war of feudal unification. This statement has aroused different opinions. However, in-depth discussion of this issue is still very necessary. Because this discussion has a close relationship with the specific understanding of the issues such as the inability of peasants to establish their own regime, and the failure of peasant wars due to the lack of leadership from advanced classes, especially the lack of leadership from the proletariat and the Communist Party.
    There are also different evaluations of some figures in the history of peasant war, such as Xiang Yu, Li Mi, and Liu Heitai, and even completely opposite conclusions. Taking the evaluation of Xiang Yu as an example, some papers divide Xiang Yu's activities into two stages for investigation: in the latter stage, the stage of unification war, Xiang Yu represented the interests of the old aristocracy, maintained feudal separatism, and was anti-historical; but in the previous stage, the stage of the peasant's anti-Qin struggle, Xiang Yu defeated the main force of the Qin army and laid the foundation for overthrowing the Qin feudal rule, so Xiang Yu should be recognized as a leader of the peasant uprising based on the activities in this main stage. Some papers also recognize Xiang Yu's role in the anti-Qin struggle, but believe that Xiang Yu has always represented the interests of the old aristocracy and do not recognize Xiang Yu as a leader of the peasant uprising. Although the discussion on such issues has not yet reached a conclusion, it is still fruitful, because these discussions make people more or less aware that the arguments such as "motivation theory" and "only class composition theory" are anti-historical.
    Based on the above situation, the research on the history of peasant war has achieved achievements in many aspects in recent years. These achievements have provided considerable assistance for the historical teaching work, and at the same time laid a preliminary foundation for further research.
    However, it should also be admitted that the research on the history of peasant war in recent years is still very unsatisfactory, and there are still many problems.
    The first problem is that many papers are limited to the description of the local and fragmented process of peasant wars. This is not only far from writing a complete history of peasant wars, but also has not drawn a more complete outline of the major events in the history of peasant wars, and some are still historical blanks. For example, for some national peasant wars such as the peasant war at the end of the Qin Dynasty, there is still a lack of a more complete description. For the peasant war at the end of the Ming Dynasty, which has such rich historical data, not only is there a lack of a comprehensive and in-depth narrative, but also a lack of depiction of Zhang Xianzhong's uprising army. Although Zhang Xianzhong's activities have many shortcomings, this is an internal matter of the uprising peasants, and the shameless slander of the feudal literati on the peasant uprising army should be the first to be cleared. Zhang Xianzhong's uprising army has many characteristics, and the wandering, erratic military action is one of them; in some years, this uprising army was the mainstream at that time; it also played an important role in overthrowing the Ming feudal rule; this uprising army should occupy enough chapters in the history of peasant war. In short, only by filling in some historical blanks and discussing the peasant wars more comprehensively can a complete history of peasant war be written. This is what needs to be strived for urgently.
    Secondly, the following kind of phenomenon in the recent research is worth considering and improving. Some papers use a few or very few, even pieced together historical materials to solve some important problems, so the result is either becoming superficial empty talk or becoming articles that repeat other people's views.
    Instead of learning the method of analyzing problems in classical works, but rigidly applying individual principles and principles in classical works to historical events, this kind of phenomenon also exists. For example, some papers groundlessly exaggerate historical facts, and rigidly and inappropriately associate some activities of Emperor Taizong of Song Dynasty and Emperor Chengzu of Ming Dynasty and some economic phenomena at that time with the partial uprising of Wang Xiaobo, Li Shun, and Tang Sai'er, in order to prove the role of peasant uprising in promoting historical progress. This is one of the examples.
    Finally, a universal and fundamental problem is that because the research scope of the history of peasant war in recent years is too narrow, limited to the exploration of local and fragmented problems, it cannot and cannot be linked with all aspects of social life or its aspects for a more comprehensive investigation, so it is impossible to explore the characteristics and laws of the era of a certain or several peasant wars. In this way, in some aspects, it becomes a superficial description of historical phenomena, thus giving people a sense of formulaic and monotonous. Therefore, people cannot help but ask: according to these papers, land concentration, cruel exploitation and oppression of the feudal ruling class, the outbreak of peasant uprising; peasant uprising attacked the feudal rule, the rulers made concessions to the peasants, and the economy developed; the land was concentrated again, and the feudal ruling class cruelly exploited and oppressed again, so peasant uprising broke out again... Doesn't this become a cycle of history? Where can we see the difference between this uprising and that uprising? Where can we see the development and changes of feudal society?
    From this, it can be seen that further improving the research level of peasant war history has reached a point of how urgent it is.
    We know that class struggle is the product of the contradiction of extremely complex social relations. It is a reflection of the contradiction between social productive forces and production relations in various periods and stages, and it is a total reflection of the contradictions of political and economic relations in various periods and stages. At the same time, class struggle not only shows the changes in economic relations in various periods and stages, which are reflected in people's ideological consciousness, but also the outcome of class struggle is even fixed in the state's legal rights at that time. Therefore, if you want to truly understand class struggle, you must organically link the above various relations and phenomena together and conduct a comprehensive analysis.
    According to this, if you want to truly explore the characteristics and laws of the era of a certain or several peasant wars, and if you want to truly understand the characteristics and laws of Chinese peasant wars, you must expand our research scope to link it with the following aspects for specific analysis and comprehensive investigation.
    First, it is not only important to understand the problem of land concentration, but more fundamentally and importantly, it is to understand the problem of changes in feudal land ownership and feudal economic relations based on it. Through the investigation in this area, it can be seen which backward economic relations that are not adapted to the development of productive forces will be eliminated in a certain period, and which economic relations that are adapted to the nature of the development of productive forces will be developed. From this change, it can also be seen how the peasant war in this period showed the specific requirements of the peasants at that time. If we combine the equal-field system and the tax system from the Northern Wei Dynasty to the first half of the Tang Dynasty with the peasant war in this period for investigation, then we can get a further understanding of these two issues.
    Second, it is not only necessary to describe the political measures (good or bad) of the feudal rulers' group, but also to specifically analyze the changes in the political system and other aspects in various periods. For example, the autocratic centralized system of the Song Dynasty, on the one hand, seriously weakened the local power in order to consolidate the centralized rule, but the feudal rulers' group did not expect that this actually made the small-scale uprisings of one or two hundred people able to traverse dozens of prefectures and counties; on the other hand, and more fundamentally, its control over the peasants was also strengthened, especially the method of recruiting famine victims as soldiers in the famine year, which played a serious role in suppressing the peasant uprising. We should comprehensively understand the political situation in various periods from the instructions that politics is the concentrated expression of economy and that any class struggle is a political struggle.
    Third, more research should be done on the changes in legal rights in various periods, and we have almost not touched on this aspect. A history of class struggle is also a history of the change in the status of labor producers, and this change is often reflected in legal rights. The status of peasants in feudal society has also changed, and the legal decrees of past dynasties roughly explain this change. Recognizing this change is of great help to clarifying the characteristics and role of peasant war in various periods.
    Fourth, other aspects such as ideology are also related to peasant war.
    Of course, further improving the scientific research level of peasant war history is also an extremely difficult task. In fact, many of the above problems also exist universally in the field of historical research. Therefore, solving these problems has become a common task of the historical academia.
    Generally speaking, the foundation of China's historical science is still very weak, and countless historical blanks need to be filled, and countless problems need to be studied. Under this circumstance, in order to clarify the problem itself, it is necessary to temporarily separate this problem or several aspects of the problem from the whole of history and conduct a relatively static investigation. This is very natural and also permissible. But in this way, the problem being studied becomes several isolated points or smaller areas, lacking connection. We accuse the research on peasant war history of not being linked to other aspects of the problem for investigation, and similarly, we can also accuse the research on other aspects of not being linked to the problem of peasant war. And here, strengthening the study of Marxist-Leninist class struggle theory and conscientiously implementing this theory into all aspects of research is the fundamental prerequisite for overcoming shortcomings.
    Secondly, the collation of historical materials is of great significance for carrying out historical scientific research work. In recent years, we have done some work in this area and have also achieved some results, which can be proved by the historical material books on peasant war history published earlier. However, this work still needs to be vigorously carried out. The work of collating historical materials should of course be done by research institutions with manpower, but this force is ultimately limited. If every historical science worker, no matter what topic they are studying, after completing their papers or monographs, arranges, compares, and revises the collected materials, either as an appendix or published separately, it will be of great benefit to the collation of historical materials. I hope the historical academia will pay attention to this issue.
    In-depth study of the history of Chinese peasant war has its great academic significance and political significance. I sincerely hope that the historical academia will strengthen the research work on peasant war history and make it quickly reach a high level of science.

    关于我国农民战争史的研究
　　漆侠
    我国封建社会经历了一个漫长的过程。在这个过程中，千百万农民为反对地主阶级残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，曾进行了数百次的起义、斗争，写下无数壮烈的英雄史诗。农民的这些起义、斗争，是封建社会发展的真正动力，是我国人民的
  光荣的革命传统。党和毛主席曾经充分地正确地估计了它的
  作用和意义，从而为我国农民战争史的研究，开拓了广阔的
  道路。
      自从1939年底毛主席的“中国革命和中国共产党”发表以后，郭沫若、范文澜、翦伯赞、吕振羽等历史学家，便以极大的热情和兴趣从事于农民战争史的研究。他们或者以专题论文的形式，或者在自己的著作中以一定的篇章，描绘了农民革命的一些英雄事迹。特别是郭沫若先生的“甲申三百年祭”这篇著名论文，在解放区和国民党统治地区都曾发生了广泛的影响和良好的作用。
    全国解放以来，农民战争史的研究，更有了蓬勃的发展。散见于报刊上的论文，粗略地估计，当不少于七十篇。汇而成为文集的，有历史教学月刊社编辑的“中国农民起义论集”，赵俪生、高昭一著的“中国农民战争史论文集”等数种。另外，还纂辑了若干种农民战争史的材料书。像郑天挺主编的“明末农民起义史料”等书，辑录了不少具有很大价值的档案材料。这些，不能不是近年来历史研究工作中的一个成就。
    概括看来，近年来农民战争史的研究成就，大致可分如下几个方面。
    首先，经过论文的作者们对于零星分散的史料的搜集、整理，以及对于新史料的钩沉、考索、抉发，使我们对于秦汉以来的几次全国性的农民战争和一些较大规模的农民起义，有了比较丰富的知识了。像黄巢领导下的唐末农民战争，他们游动的路线是很杂乱的，现在经过整理，便有了一个清楚的脉络。像陈胜、吴广北上进军的路线，隋朝翟让起义的年份，窦建德同河北人民的深厚关系，宋朝王小波、李顺起义同“贩茶失职”人群的联系，宋江是否征过方腊，以及李自成殉难的确实地点等问题，也都经过订正考补，给以确实的说明。对于一些湮灭无闻的起义事迹，如明中叶荆襄山区刘通、李原领导的流民起义，刘六、刘七在黄河下游一带的起义，也都经过探讨而显现出来了。
    其次，对于每次农民起义、农民战争爆发的背景和原因，许多论文作了一定的分析。一般来说，对于封建统治的残暴和当权者集团的腐朽这一起义爆发的原因，是揭露得颇为充分的。对于各个时期的土地所有制，特别是土地集中的问题、赋役制度的问题，也有所论述，从而初步地接触到：以封建土地所有制为基础的封建经济诸关系，同农民战争爆发有着内部的联系。此外，有的论文还能依据具体材料进行分析，阐明了某次农民战争之所以爆发在某一地区的原因。这就给人以这样一个认识：农民战争的爆发，在一般的普遍的原因当中，有其独自的特殊的面貌。这类研究，对于抉发农民起义、农民战争的时代特征，是有所帮助的。
    对于农民的革命斗争是推动封建社会前进的真正动力的问题，也是近年研究中所致力探索的。一些论文以比较丰富的材料，论证了这个问题的某些侧面。像唐太宗对农民让步的思想、唐初赋役的相对减轻和均田制较为广泛的推行，以及由此而来的唐帝国经济文化的高涨，同隋末农民战争有血肉相联的关系；明太祖对官僚豪势的压制、对农业生产的重视，以及明初经济的迅速恢复和发展，同元末农民战争有不可分割的联系。这些论点都较符合实际状况，因而可以肯定下来。对于被地主统治集团镇压下去的巨大的农民战争，如唐末农民战争，对历史发展起了怎样的作用，也都有所论列。有的论文认为，五代十国经济的发展，对唐末农民战争起了推动作用。这是否能够成为确论，尚待商量。但作为尝试来看，则是很值得提倡的。任何科学部门，不经尝试，是发现不了新的问题的。
    同其他科学研究一样，农民战争史的研究中对于若干问题，也存在着不同意见的争论。像在某些战争过程中，农民的反封建压迫的战争怎样转化为封建统一的战争，便是一个争论的问题。隋末农民战争便是争论的具体对象。
    有的文章根据事实材料，说明农民的自发的反封建压迫斗争，由于他们的小生产者的地位而产生了这种内在的矛盾，即：有反封建压迫的要求，但摆脱不了封建制度的枷锁。这样，隋末农民的反抗斗争虽然推翻了隋封建统治，却不能建立自己的政权。因此，在隋亡之后，贵族地主伺隙乘机，企图建立政权，而农民起义军的领导者和上层分子，也因时代条件的限制，不自觉地向封建主道路上转化，参与了对封建统治权的争夺。于是，战争的性质便随着隋政权的颠复而发生了变化，从反封建压迫性质的战争转化为封建统一性质的战争。这个说法曾引起了不同的意见。但是，深入讨论这个问题，还是很必要的。因为，这个讨论对于农民不能建立自己的政权，农民战争得不到先进阶级的领导特别是得不到无产阶级和共产党的领导总是陷于失败等问题的具体理解，有着密切的关系。
    对于农民战争史上的一些人物，如项羽、李密、刘黑闼等，也有不同的评价，甚至有完全相反的论断。今以对项羽的评价为例。有的论文把项羽的活动划分为两个阶段考察：在后一阶段即统一战争阶段，项羽代表了旧贵族的利益，维护封建割据，是反历史的；但在前一个阶段即农民的反秦斗争阶段，项羽击溃秦军主力，为推翻秦封建统治奠立了基础，因之应根据这个主要阶段的活动，承认项羽是个农民起义的领袖。有的论文虽也承认项羽在反秦斗争中的作用，但是认为项羽始终是代表旧贵族利益的，不承认项羽是个农民起义的领袖。有关这类问题的讨论，虽还没有得出结论，仍然是有收获的，因为这些讨论使人或多或少地了解到，“动机论”和“唯成分论”等论点是反历史主义的。
    依据上述情况来说，近年来农民战争史的研究在许多方面是有成就的。这些成就，对于历史教学工作有了相当的帮助，同时为进一步的研究奠定下初步基础。
    但是，也应该承认，近年来农民战争史的研究还很不能令人满意，其中还存在着很多的问题。
    第一个问题是：许多论文仅限于农民战争的局部、片段过程的描述，这不但距写作一部首尾贯串的农民战争史还相差甚远，而且对农民战争史上的重大事件，还没钩出比较完整的轮廓，有的甚至依然是历史的空白。像对于某些全国性的农民战争如秦末农民战争，就还缺少较为完整的描述。对于历史资料是如此丰富的明末农民战争，也还不但缺乏全面、深刻的叙述，而且缺乏对张献忠起义军的描绘。固然张献忠的活动有很多缺点，这是起义农民内部的事情，而无耻的封建文人横施于农民起义军的诬蔑那就更多了，这些应该是最先加以清算的。张献忠起义军的活动有许多特点，游踪不定、飘忽无常的军事行动便是其中之一；在某些年份内，这支起义军是当时的主流；在推翻明封建统治方面，它也起了重要作用；在农民战争史上，这支起义军应该占有足够的篇章。总之，只有在填充了若干的历史空白、较全面地论述各次农民战争的基础上，才可能写出一部首尾贯串的农民战争史。这是亟待努力的。
    其次，在近年来的研究中的下面一类的现象，是值得考虑和加以改善的。有的论文根据不多的或者很少的，甚至东拼西凑来的历史材料，就来动手解决若干重要问题，因而结果不是成为浮泛的空论，就是成为复述别人见解的文章。
    不是学习经典著作中分析问题的方法，而是把经典著作中的个别原理原则硬套在历史事件上，这类现象也是存在的。像有的论文毫无根据地夸大了历史事实，硬把宋太宗和明成祖的某些活动以及当时若干经济上的现象，完全不适当地同王小波、李顺、唐赛儿的局部起义关联起来，以来证明农民起义推动历史前进的作用，就是这类例证之一。
    最后，一个普遍的根本的问题是：由于近年来农民战争史的研究范围太窄，限于局部、片段问题的探讨，不能也不可能同社会生活的各个方面或其侧面联系起来，进行比较全面的考察，所以无法探寻某一次或某几次农民战争的时代特征和规律。这样一来，在某些方面就变成为对历史现象的浮光掠影的表述，从而给人以公式化、千篇一律的感觉。因此，人们不禁要问：按照这些论文，土地集中、封建统治阶级的残酷剥削、压迫，爆发了农民起义；农民起义打击了封建统治，统治者对农民让步，经济得到了发展；土地又集中了，封建统治阶级又残酷剥削、压迫了，于是又爆发了农民起义……这不成了历史的循环了么？到底从哪里看出这次起义同那次起义的区别？到底从哪里看出封建社会的发展变化？
    由此可见，进一步提高农民战争史的研究水平，已经到了如何迫切的时候了。
    我们知道，阶级斗争乃是极其复杂的社会关系的矛盾产物。它是各个时期各个阶段的社会生产力同生产关系的矛盾反映，是各个时期各个阶段政治经济诸关系矛盾的总反映。同时，阶级斗争不仅展示了各个时期各个阶段的经济关系的变化，在人们的思想意识中得到反映，而且阶级斗争的结局甚至固定在当时的国家法权之中。所以，要想真正了解阶级斗争，就必须把上面的各种关系和现象有机地联系起来，进行全面的分析。
    准此而论，要想真正抉发某一次或某几次农民战争的时代特征和规律，要想真正了解我国农民战争的特征和规律，必须扩大我们的研究范围，以同下述几个方面联系起来，进行具体的分析和综合的考察。
    一，不只了解土地集中的问题，更根本更重要的是了解封建土地所有制及以此为基础的封建经济诸关系的变化的问题。通过这方面的考察，将可以看到，在某个时期内哪些落后的不适应生产力发展的经济关系将被排除，哪些适应生产力发展性质的经济关系得到发展。自这种变化中将又可以看到，这个时期的农民战争怎样显示了当时农民的具体要求。如果我们把北魏到唐前半期的均田制度、赋役制度同这个时期内的农民战争结合起来考察，那么我们对这两个问题是可以得到进一步的认识的。
    二，不只把封建统治者集团的政治措施（好的或坏的）叙述出来，而且应该具体分析各个时期政治制度等方面的变化。像宋代专制主义中央集权制度，一方面它为巩固集权统治而严重地削弱地方权力，但封建统治者集团却没有料想到，这竟使百八十人的小股起义的农民能够纵横数十州郡；另一方面而且是根本方面，它对农民的控制也加强了，特别是荒年招募饥民为兵的办法，对农民起义起了严重的抑制作用。我们从政治是经济的集中表现、任何阶级斗争都是政治斗争这些指示考察，更应该全面了解各个时期的政治状况了。
    三，对于各个时期的法权的变化更应多加研究，在这方面我们几乎还没有接触到。一部阶级斗争的历史，同时也是一部劳动生产者地位变化的历史，而这种变化往往从法权中体现出来。农民在封建社会的地位也是有所变化的，历代法制律令大体上说明了这个变化。认识这个变化，对阐明各个时期农民战争的特征和作用，是有很大帮助的。
    四，其他如意识形态方面同农民战争也有关系。
    当然、进一步提高农民战争史的科学研究水平，这也是一件极为困难的事。事实上，上面的许多问题，也是历史研究领域中普遍存在着的。因此，解决这些问题便成为史学界的共同任务了。
    一般来说，我国历史科学的基础还很薄弱，无数的历史空白都待填补，无数的问题都待研究。在这种情况下，为着弄清问题的本身，就不得不将这个问题或问题的某几个方面同历史的整体暂时地割开，进行相对静止的考察。这是很自然的，而且也是容许的。但是这样一来，所研究的问题就成为若干个孤立的点或较小的面，缺乏联系了。我们指责农民战争史的研究没有同其他方面的问题联系起来考察，同样地，我们也可指责其他方面的研究没有同农民战争的问题联系起来考察。而在这里，加强马克思列宁主义的阶级斗争理论的学习，把这个理论切实地贯注到研究的各个方面，是克服缺点的根本前提。
    其次，史料的整理对于开展历史科学研究工作具有重大意义。近几年来，我们在这方面做了一些工作，也取得一些成绩，前面提到出版的关于农民战争史的史料书就可证明。但是，这个工作还需要大力开展。整理史料的工作，固然要由研究机关配备人力来做，然而这种力量究竟是有限的。如果每个历史科学工作者，无论研究什么题目，在完成自己的论文或专著之后，把搜集的材料，加以排比考订，或作为附录，或另行刊印，那末对于史料的整理，是大有裨益的。希望史学界注意这个问题。
    深入研究我国农民战争的历史，是有其重大的学术意义和政治意义的。深盼史学界加强农民战争史的研究工作，使其迅速地达到高度的科学水平。
