Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 29th: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long arrived in Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, at 6:30 PM on the 28th from Lahore. They were greeted with one of the grandest welcomes during their visit to Pakistan.

　　An estimated 50,000 people gathered at the airport to welcome them, some from as far as fifty miles away. When the plane carrying the Chinese guests landed with its headlights on, the welcoming crowd erupted in thunderous cheers.

　　As Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long stepped off the plane under the bright lights of the cinematographers, the welcoming crowd roared with enthusiastic cheers and shouted slogans such as "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship." The welcoming crowd broke through the police cordon and surrounded the Chinese guests. Countless hands waved to welcome the guests. People pushed and shoved each other. The cars were unable to move forward and remained at the airport for about half an hour.

　　Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy, who arrived earlier, the Chief Minister of East Pakistan, Fazlul Haq, and a large number of military and government officials were at the airport to welcome them. Maulana Bhashani, leader of the East Pakistan Awami League, also came to the airport to welcome them.

　　Along the five-mile route from the airport to the Governor's House, the crowds lining the streets to welcome them were extremely large, and the motorcade had to proceed at a very slow pace. Pakistani and Chinese flags hung on both sides of the road, and countless colorful lights illuminated the buildings. People thronged towards each car to shake hands with the Chinese guests, saying, "Welcome," "Bhai, Bhai" (brother), or "Salaam-Alaikum" (Islamic greeting). There were also many welcoming arches along the way, some of which were painted with dragons or elephants.

　　When Premier Zhou Enlai arrived at the Governor's House, hundreds of high-ranking government officials and prominent figures from Dhaka had already gathered on the lawn in front of the Governor's House, preparing to hold a reception to welcome the Chinese guests.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 29th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Premier He Long, and their entourage were warmly welcomed by more than 5,000 representatives of the people of East Pakistan at a grand reception held in Dhaka on the evening of the 28th.

　　Chairman of the Welcome Committee, Ataur Rahman, said in his address to the guests that Zhou Enlai came to Pakistan "as an envoy of goodwill and a symbol of the growing friendship between Pakistan and China."

　　Ataur Rahman is the Chief Minister of East Pakistan and also the Chairman of the East Pakistan Peace Committee and the Pakistan-China Friendship Association. He said that the mutual visits of the two prime ministers "will be the beginning of the deepening understanding and expanding contact between our two peoples."

　　He talked about the relations between the two countries, which can be traced back to the early days of human history. He talked about the development he saw in China during his visit a few years ago. He said: "China has played a great leading role in breaking, in forever breaking the myth of 'Asian backwardness' that the Western conquerors have deliberately created."

　　Regarding Pakistan, he said: "Although we have taken different paths, like you, we have been working hard to achieve a new balance and move towards a new life in order to promote the spirit of mankind and achieve the victory of peace. The path of progress of each country largely depends on its past, and we are also building a new civilization according to our characteristics, at which time happiness will no longer be the privilege of a class or race, but will become the common property of mankind."

　　In his reply, Zhou Enlai said that since the two countries gained independence, relations between the two countries have been further developed and given new content. He said that although the two countries have different political systems, they are facing many common problems—overcoming the backwardness left over from colonialism and needing a peaceful international environment for construction, and the people of the two countries wholeheartedly hope to help each other. He said: "Both of our countries hope that the friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China will continue to deepen forever."

　　Premier Zhou Enlai concluded by saying that he hoped that his visit to Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, a famous political, cultural, and industrial center of Pakistan, "will make us better friends with each other, so that my colleagues and I can learn more useful things from you, and make some contributions to the noble task of promoting Asian-African people's solidarity and defending world peace."

　　Ataur Rahman presented Zhou Enlai with a silver sailboat engraved with a welcome message. Zhou Enlai expressed his gratitude. He said with a smile in English: "I will take this sailboat with your Prime Minister to China." Then he quoted a Chinese proverb, hoping that the contacts and cooperation between the two countries will develop smoothly.

　　Among the prominent figures who attended this joyful event were Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy and Awami League leader Maulana Bhashani.

　　After the meeting, Zhou Enlai, He Long, and their entourage were invited to attend a banquet held by the Governor of East Pakistan, Fazlul Haq, for them.

    愿中巴两国的接触和合作一帆风顺
    东巴基斯坦首府热烈欢迎中国客人
    据新华社达卡29日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在28日下午六点三十分从拉合尔到达东巴基斯坦首府达卡。他们受到了在巴基斯坦访问期间的一次最盛大的欢迎。
    聚集在机场欢迎的有五万人，其中有些人来自五十英里以外。当中国客人们乘坐的飞机开着头灯着陆的时候，欢迎的人群发出了雷动的欢呼声。
    当周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在电影摄影师的水银灯的强光照耀下走下飞机的时候，欢迎的人发出了热情的欢呼声，并且高呼“巴中友谊万岁”等口号。欢迎的人群突破了警察的警卫线，团团围住中国客人们。无数只手在挥动着向客人表示欢迎。人们互相推挤。汽车无法向前开动，在机场停留约半小时。
    到机场欢迎的有先期到达这里的巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底，东巴基斯坦首长法兹鲁尔·哈克和大批军政官员。东巴基斯坦人民联盟领袖大毛拉巴沙尼也到机场欢迎。
    从机场到省长府的五英里长的路上，夹道欢迎的人群非常之多，车队不得不以极慢的速度前进。路的两旁挂着巴基斯坦和中国的国旗，无数彩色的电灯把建筑物照得通亮。人们拥向每一辆车子同中国客人们握手，对他们说：“欢迎”，“巴依，巴依”（兄弟），或“萨拉姆阿勒古姆”（伊斯兰教徒见面问候语）。沿途还有许多表示欢迎的拱门，有些拱门上画着龙或象。
    在周恩来总理到达省长府的时候，有几百名高级政府官员和达卡的著名人物已经聚集在省长府前面的草地上，准备举行招待会来欢迎中国客人。
    据新华社达卡29日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员28日晚上七时在达卡举行的一次盛大欢迎会上，受到五千多位东巴基斯坦人民的代表的热烈欢迎。
    欢迎委员会主席阿陶尔·拉赫曼在向客人致词的时候说，周恩来是“作为亲善的使者及巴基斯坦和中国之间的日益增长的友谊的象征”到巴基斯坦来的。
    阿陶尔·拉赫曼是东巴基斯坦的首席部长，也是东巴基斯坦和平委员会和巴中友好协会的主席。他说，两国总理的互相访问“将是我们两国人民之间不断加深了解和不断扩大接触的开始”。
    他谈到了两国之间的关系，这种关系可以一直追溯到人类历史的初期。他谈到他在几年前访问中国的时候所看到的中国的发展状况。他说：“中国在打破、在永远地打破西方征服者所处心积虑地制造出来的‘亚洲的落后性’的神话方面，起了极大的带头作用。”
    关于巴基斯坦，他说：“我们虽然采取的途径不同，但是同你们一样，一直在努力达到新的平衡并且向新生活推进，以求使人类的精神能够发扬光大，使和平取得胜利。每一个国家的进步的道路在很大程度上决定于它的过去，我们同样的也正在按照我们的特点建设新的文明，到那个时候，幸福将不再是阶级或者种族的特权，而将成为人类的共同所有的东西。”
    周恩来致答词说，自从两国赢得独立以来，两国关系已经得到了进一步的发展并且被赋予新的内容。他说，虽然两国政治制度不同，它们正面临着许多共同的问题——克服殖民主义所遗留下的落后状况和需要和平的国际环境进行建设，两国人民全心希望彼此帮助。他说：“我们两国都希望，巴基斯坦和中国两国人民间的友谊将永远不断地加深。”
    周恩来总理最后说，他希望对东巴基斯坦首府、巴基斯坦著名的政治、文化和工业中心之一达卡的访问，“将使我们彼此成为更好的朋友，使得我的同事们和我能够从你们那里学得更多有益的东西，并且对促进亚非人民团结和保卫世界和平这一崇高任务能有所贡献”。
    阿陶尔·拉赫曼赠给周恩来一只刻有欢迎词的银帆船。周恩来表示感谢。他用英语笑着说：“我将同你们的总理乘着这只帆船到中国去。”接着他引用了中国的俗语说，希望两国的接触和合作将发展得一帆风顺。
    出席这次欢乐的盛会的著名人士中有巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底和人民联盟领袖大毛拉巴沙尼。
    会后，周恩来、贺龙和随行人员应邀参加了东巴基斯坦省长法兹鲁尔·哈克为他们举行的晚宴。
