Xinhua News Agency, December 30th, Athens: Greek government officials have expressed "great dissatisfaction" with the US support for the deceptive British proposal regarding the Cyprus issue.

The Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 29th that he regretted the US attitude. He worried that this US attitude would affect the attitudes of many other countries in the United Nations on the Cyprus issue. He also said that Greece could not consider the British proposal, primarily because it was "illegal and undemocratic," granting the British Governor in Cyprus almost unlimited power. He expressed dissatisfaction with the British colonial authorities' refusal to release the exiled Archbishop Makarios.

    希腊外交部发言人不满美国支持英国对塞浦路斯的建议
    新华社30日电　雅典消息：希腊政府人士对美国支持英国提出的关于塞浦路斯问题的欺骗性建议表示“非常不满”。
    希腊外交部的发言人29日说，他对美国的态度感到很遗憾。他担心美国这种态度在联合国内会对其他许多国家在塞浦路斯问题上的态度发生影响。他还说，希腊不能考虑英国的建议，首先是因为这个建议是“非法的和不民主的”，它使英国总督在塞浦路斯拥有几乎是无限制的权力。他对英国殖民当局拒绝释放放逐的塞浦路斯大主教马卡里奥斯表示不满。
