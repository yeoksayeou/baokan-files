    Reading "About the Yan Translation"
    Yan Jianbi
    After reading "About the Yan Translation" on page eight of the October 28th "People's Daily," I felt very excited and grateful, but also a little ashamed. The fact that my short article could attract the attention of Mr. Jiang Shaoyuan, a folklore expert and senior scholar, and receive his guidance, truly makes me excited and grateful. The reason for my shame is that it makes me even more aware of how little knowledge I possess and that I must work harder and diligently seek advice from senior experts.
    In addition to the above, I would also like to add two points of explanation.
    1. I am aware that this story also appears in "Lüshi Chunqiu." The reason I chose the story from "Wei Ce" when writing the article was because it was much more vivid. I originally intended to mention that it also appeared in "Lüshi Chunqiu" and explain the differences in the story, but I was afraid the article would be too long, so I didn't.
    2. In Mr. Jiang's article, he said: "In the story in 'Lüshi Chunqiu,' the 'stove' must not have been a portable stove but a ground stove built on the spot."
    Here I have a small question. I don't know if the "jiao fire" in "Lüshi Chunqiu," "A young man holds a banana leaf fire to saw, and the new bride says, 'The banana leaf fire is too big,'" is a "ground stove"? Judging from the original text, especially the word "holds," it is difficult to say it is a "ground stove." And from the very careful annotations of Bi Yuan, Yu Yue, etc., it is also not clear that it is a "ground stove." If it is not a "ground stove," then Mr. Jiang's statement seems to be worth further study. Mr. Jiang said "presumably," and his argument seems to lack sufficient evidence.
    Editor's Note: After Mr. Jiang Shaoyuan's "About the Yan Translation" was published, we received five readers' opinions, the content of which was roughly similar to Mr. Yan Jianbi's opinion published here. Because this is purely an academic discussion and not a topic of interest to the general reader, we do not plan to continue publishing articles on this issue.

    读“关于阎译”
    阎简弼
    “人民日报”10月28日八版上有篇“关于阎译”，读完之后，非常兴奋、感激，同时也有一点惭赧。我的一篇短文，能引起民俗专家、前辈江绍原先生的注意，予以指教，这真使得我兴奋而又感激。所以惭赧的，是由此更知道自己的知识太少，还得多多努力，勤向前辈专家们请益。
    除上述之外，我还愿意略加两点说明。
    一、这个故事也见于“吕氏春秋”，我是知道的。写文章时，所以取“卫策”的故事，是因为它生动得多。本想也提明亦见“吕氏春秋”，并说明故事有不同处，但恐文章太长，所以就没有提。
    二、江先生文中说：“吕氏春秋”中的故事里的“灶想必也还不是可以搬来搬去的火炉而是就地筑成的地灶”。
    这里我有一小点疑问，就是不知道“吕氏春秋”“竖子操蕉火而钜，新妇曰：‘蕉火大钜’”中的“蕉火”是不是“地灶”？从原文，尤其从“操”字看很难说是“地灶”。而从毕沅、俞樾等的很下工夫的注释中，也看不出说是“地灶”来。如果不是“地灶”，则江先生的说法，似乎还值得研究。江先生说“想必”，似乎论证还微嫌不足。
    编者附记：江绍原先生的“关于阎译”发表以后，我们接到五篇读者的意见，内容大致和这里登出的阎简弼先生的意见相似。因为这是纯属考证方面的讨论，不是一般读者有兴趣阅读的问题，所以不准备继续发表关于这个问题的文章了。
