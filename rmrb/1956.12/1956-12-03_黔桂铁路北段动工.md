Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, December 2nd (Xinhua News Agency reporter He Yongfeng reports): The construction of the new section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, the Du(yun)-Zhu(guiyang) section, which was started ahead of schedule during the First Five-Year Plan period, has recently begun in segments.

The Du(yun)-Zhu(guiyang) section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway is more than 140 kilometers long and the project is relatively arduous. It not only has to pass through more than twenty tunnels and many bridges and culverts, but also the roadbed engineering requires extensive excavation and filling. According to preliminary calculations, the average earth and stone excavation and filling required for each kilometer of the entire line is about 100,000 cubic meters, which is about twenty times higher than the earth and stone excavation and filling per kilometer of the Beijing-Hankou Railway.

The Guizhou-Guangxi Railway is more than 440 kilometers long and is divided into northern and southern sections with Duyun County as the center, namely the Jin(chenggjiang)-Du(yun) section and the Du(yun)-Zhu(guiyang) section. The Duzhu section is a new construction project, and the Jindu section is a restoration project. The restoration project of the Jindu section has been underway since October of last year, and more than 200 kilometers of track have been laid so far. It is expected to be basically completed by the end of this year. When the entire line is completed in the future, the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas of Guizhou will be able to take trains and travel through the Xiang-Gui Railway to all provinces in the interior of the motherland.

　  黔桂铁路北段动工
    新华社贵阳2日电　新华社记者贺永丰报道：提前在第一个五年计划期内修建的黔桂铁路，它的新建部分——都（匀）筑（贵阳）段的线路工程在最近先后分段动工。
    黔桂铁路都（匀）筑（贵阳）段共长一百四十多公里，工程比较艰巨。它不仅要穿过二十多座隧道和许多桥梁、涵洞，而且路基工程也需要大挖大填。据初步计算，全线平均每一公里要挖填的土石方就有十万立公方左右，比京汉铁路每公里挖填的土石方要高出二十倍左右。
    黔桂铁路共长四百四十多公里，以都匀县城为中心分为南北两段，即金（城江）都（匀）段和都
  （匀）筑（贵阳）段。都筑段是新建工程，金都段是修复工程。金都段的修复工程已经从去年10月开始进行，目前已经铺轨二百多公里，预计在今年年底可以基本完成。将来全线修通后，贵州山区的各族人民，就可以坐上火车，经过湘桂铁路遍行祖国内地各省了。
