    Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: The National Archives Work Conference concluded today. The conference began on the 18th.
    In recent years, archives work in various regions has made considerable progress. File creation work in document processing departments has been implemented in many agencies. Provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government have established archives management offices, and some central agencies have also established management organizations, strengthening guidance and supervision of archives work within their subordinate systems. In addition, a preliminary plan for the national archives network has been proposed. Construction of the Central Archives of the People's Republic of China has begun. Achievements have also been made in organizing archives and training cadres in recent years.
    The conference discussed the tasks of national archives work. The conference believes that the task of national archives work is not only to establish archive offices in agencies for reference and work consultation but also to build a national archives network. This involves systematically and purposefully organizing the utilization of archival materials in archives at all levels to serve national tasks and scientific research and constantly improve the level of archival science and train a group of highly capable professional cadres. Given the current situation, the immediate priority should be to improve and develop the work of agency archives offices. The conference requested that all agencies fully implement file creation work in document processing departments in 1957 and correctly establish filing systems. It also requested that all agencies and regions basically complete the task of organizing accumulated archives within two years and strive to complete the organization of archives from the old regime by 1958, laying the foundation for scientific research work in establishing archives.
    The conference also discussed the current issues of strengthening leadership and training cadres for national archives work. The "Provisional Regulations for Archives Offices of State Agencies" and the "Reference Table of Retention Periods for Archival Materials of State Agencies" were discussed at the meeting.

    全国档案工作会议结束
    据新华社22日讯　全国档案工作会议已在今天结束。这个会议是在18日开始的。
    几年来各地档案工作已取得了不少的成绩。文书处理部门立卷工作已经在许多机关中实行了，省、自治区、直辖市已建立了档案管理处，中央一部分机关也建立了管理机构，加强了对所属系统的档案工作的指导和监督。另外，国家档案馆网的规划，已经提出了一个初步方案。中华人民共和国中央档案馆已经开始兴建。几年来在整理档案、培养干部方面也取得了成绩。
    会议讨论了国家档案工作的任务。会议认为，国家档案工作的任务不仅是要建立机关档案室，供机关的调阅和对工作的查考，而且要建成全国档案馆网，在各级档案机构中建立有系统地有计划地组织档案材料的利用工作，为国家的各项工作和科学研究工作服务，还要不断地提高档案科学水平，培养一批有较高能力的专业干部。就目前的情况看，应该首先做好健全和开展机关档案室的工作。会议要求各机关在1957年内要全面推行文书处理部门立卷的工作，正确地建立起归档制度，还要求各机关和各地能在两年内基本上完成整理积存档案的任务和争取在1958年把旧政权档案整理完毕，为建立档案馆的科学研究工作打下基础。
    会议还对当前加强领导和培养国家档案工作干部的问题进行了讨论。会上讨论了“国家机关档案室工作试行通则”和“国家机关档案材料保管期限参考表”。
