Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 4th: The "People's Freedom Newspaper" published on the 2nd the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government's appeal to protect the property of production cooperatives, machine tractor stations, and state farms.

The appeal pointed out that during the recent events, hostile elements and irresponsible individuals in some production cooperatives, machine tractor stations, and state farms privately stole public property such as tools, machines, and livestock. This illegal practice first and foremost caused losses to cooperative members and the national economy, and at the same time hindered the normal progress of production.

The Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government calls on the responsible personnel and staff of production cooperatives, machine tractor stations, and state farms to use all means to prevent illegal theft or destruction of the public property of cooperatives and the state, to carefully protect and manage these properties, and to use them appropriately.

The government has instructed all state power organs and public security forces to resolutely organize themselves to combat all illegal acts and looting, and to fight against those who violate laws and discipline and damage social wealth.

　　匈政府号召保护农村公有财产
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　“人民自由报”2日刊载了匈牙利工农革命政府关于保护生产合作社、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的财产的号召。
    号召指出，在最近的事件过程中，有些生产合作社、机器拖拉机站和国营农场里发生了敌对分子和不负责任的分子私自窃取工具、机器、牲畜等公共财物的现象。这种违反法律的做法首先使合作社社员和国民经济遭受损失，同时，还阻碍了生产的正常进行。
    匈牙利工农革命政府号召生产合作社、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的负责人员和工作人员，用一切办法来阻止非法窃取或破坏合作社和国家的公共财物的行为，认真地保护和处理这些财物，并且恰当地使用它们。
    政府指示所有的国家政权机关和公安部队组织坚决地起来对一切违反法律的行为和抢劫现象，对违法乱纪和损害社会财富的人进行斗争。
