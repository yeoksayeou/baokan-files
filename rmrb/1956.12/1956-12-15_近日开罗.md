    Recent Days in Cairo
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun
    Cairo and all of Egypt are now awaiting the day when the British and French invading forces completely withdraw. That day is approaching, and it will mark the complete defeat of the invaders and the victory of the Egyptian people and the peaceful forces of the world.
    In Port Said, 220 kilometers from Cairo, the withdrawal of British and French troops is nearing its final stage. Newspapers here report that the last of the invading forces are about to leave Egyptian territory, and publish photos of the heroic and unyielding people of Port Said, who, with a spirit of contempt for the invaders, are demonstrating and marching, holding high the banner of "We Support Nasser." Journalists here are eager to go to Port Said to report on the atrocities of the invaders and the heroic deeds of the people of Port Said. Some foreign journalists are visiting the Canal Zone and the Sinai Peninsula. People evacuated from Ismailia and Suez have returned to their homes, and 3,000 people will be sent back to Port Said every day after the enemy withdraws. Plans have been made to rebuild Port Said and other damaged cities. A historical documentary recording the series of events from the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company to the withdrawal of British and French forces has been completed and sent to China.
    In Cairo, a city much like Shanghai, everything is as usual, and the streets are bustling with traffic. To suit the hot summer climate, the trams here are open, with no doors or windows. Like in China, many street vendors are peddling melon seeds, peanuts, toys, and other inexpensive goods along the streets. This reminds us of the streets of Beijing. On the street bookstalls, you can see the works of Mao Zedong and Lu Xun. Shops are open for business, and the fruit stores selling golden Egyptian oranges are particularly charming. The working hours here are from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. After work, the streets are very lively. In the old city of Cairo, you can see many shops selling beer, cigarettes, or various daily necessities, very much like the shops in Beijing. In front of the shops, some Egyptians sit and smoke Arab water pipes, with the lamp for lighting the tobacco placed on the ground, resembling a small pagoda.
    However, the traces of war are still evident. Cairo remains on alert. A blackout is still in effect at night, and there are no lights on the streets. Only the headlights of cars and the dim lights inside shops illuminate the pedestrians on the streets. On the banks of the Nile, soldiers stand in air-raid shelters, with the muzzles of anti-aircraft guns pointing towards the blue sky. The History Museum has not yet reopened, and schools have not yet started. Schools are not in session because most students have joined the National Liberation Army, and many schools have been turned into first-aid stations or centers for supporting the front lines. Young men and women are receiving military and medical training. National Guards belonging to the National Liberation Army march through the streets in formation, many carrying rifles but wearing civilian clothes. People are raising funds for refugees. In the opera house, where Verdi's opera "Aida" was performed ninety years ago, Steinbeck's "The Moon is Down" is now being staged, reminiscent of the struggle of the people of Port Said against aggression.
    The deserted hotels also remind people of the war. Winter is the ideal season for travelers. Cairo's climate is like Beijing in October, neither hot nor cold, with lush trees, green grass, and blooming flowers. People hope that city life will return to normal after the withdrawal of the invading forces. Not long ago, many Asian, European, and American airlines announced that Cairo's air passenger and cargo transportation would soon be restored. It is said that 400 Czechoslovakian tourists will arrive on the 15th. The United Nations Emergency Force stationed in the Canal Zone will vacation in Cairo. From the night of the 10th, the lighthouses of the Egyptian sea were relit.
    The Egyptian people love peace. They know how to hate the enemy and how to love their friends. The Egyptian people highly value the sincere support of the Chinese people. Although we have only been in Cairo for a few days, we have deeply felt the friendship of the Egyptian people towards the Chinese people. Officers, soldiers, and civilians have all expressed their love for the Chinese people to us. When we drive or walk on the streets, Egyptians always look at us with surprise and say to each other: "Suini, Suini!" (meaning Chinese). In the zoo, a middle-aged woman sitting on the grass greeted us and said: "God bless you." One day on the street, a person stopped us and asked: Chinese? Then he shook hands with us enthusiastically, saying: Welcome, welcome. It is impossible to write down all such things, but one thing is very clear: after the test of war and peace, colonialism and anti-colonialism, the friendship and understanding between the Chinese and Egyptian people have been strengthened.

    近日开罗
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    开罗和整个埃及现在正等待着英、法侵略军全部撤退的那一天的到来。这一天临近了，它将标志着侵略者的彻底失败和埃及人民和全世界和平力量的胜利。
    在开罗二百二十公里外的塞得港，英法部队的撤退已近最后阶段。此间报纸报道，最后一名侵略军即将离开埃及领土，报纸并刊登了英雄不屈的塞得港人民的照片，他们带着蔑视侵略者的气概，高举着“我们拥护纳赛尔”的旗帜示威游行。这里的记者都渴望着到塞得港，就地报道侵略者的暴行和塞得港人民的英勇事迹。有些外国记者正在访问运河区和西奈半岛。从伊士美利亚和苏伊士疏散出来的人民已经重返家园，在敌人撤退后，每天将有三千人被遣送回塞得港。重建塞得港和其他遭到破坏的城市的计划已经作出了。录下从苏伊士运河公司国有化到英法部队撤退这一连串事件的历史文献记录片已经摄制完毕，并已送给中国。
    在开罗，这个很像上海的城市，一切如常，街上车水马龙。为了适合炎热的夏天气候，这里的电车都是敞开的，没有门也没有窗。像在中国一样，沿街许多小贩在兜售瓜子、花生、玩具和其它便宜的商品。这使我们想起了北京的街道。在街头的书摊上，可以看到毛泽东和鲁迅的著作。商店都开门营业，那些出卖金色埃及橘的水果店特别迷人。这儿从早晨八点钟到下午两点钟是工作时间。下班以后街上热闹非常。在开罗旧城，可以看到许多卖啤酒、香烟或各种日用品的商店，极像北京的店铺。店门前，一些埃及人坐着吸阿拉伯水烟管，点烟的灯放在地上，仿佛是一座小塔。
    但是战争的痕迹历历在目。开罗仍然戒备着。晚上仍实行灯火管制，街上没有灯火。只有汽车的前灯和商店里面的灯光暗淡地照着街上的行人。尼罗河两岸的桥畔，兵士们站在防空壕里，高射炮的炮口指向蔚蓝色的天空。历史博物馆尚未开放，学校还没有开学。学校不上课是因为大多数学生参加了民族解放军，同时许多学校已变成了急救站或支援前线的中心站。男女青年正受着军事和医疗训练。隶属民族解放军的国民警卫队列队走过街道，许多人背着步枪，但穿着平民服装。人们正在为难民募捐。九十年前上演过维尔迪的歌剧“阿伊达”的歌剧院里，今天正上演斯坦贝克的“月亮下去了”，它令人联想起塞得港人民反抗侵略的斗争。
    门庭冷落的旅馆也使人想到战争。冬季是旅行者最理想的季节。开罗的气候宛如十月的北京，不热也不冷，树木苍翠，绿草如茵，百花盛放。人们希望，在侵略军撤退后城市生活将一切如昔。不久以前，许多亚洲、欧洲和美洲的航空公司都宣布，开罗的航空客、货运输迅将恢复。听说四百个捷克斯洛伐克的旅客将在15日到达。驻在运河区的联合国紧急部队将到开罗度假。从10日夜晚起，埃及海的灯塔重放光明。
    埃及人民热爱和平，他们知道怎样憎恨敌人，怎样热爱朋友。埃及人民十分重视中国人民的真诚支持。虽然我们到开罗才几天，但是我们已深深感受到埃及人民对中国人民的友情。军官、士兵和老百姓都向我们表示他们热爱中国人民。当我们驱车或者步行街上的时候，埃及人总是很惊奇地看我们，彼此说：“苏伊尼，苏伊尼！”（意即中国人）。在动物园里，一位坐在草地上的中年妇女迎着我们说：“真主保佑你们”。有一天在街上，一个人止住我们问：中国人吗？接着逐个地和我们热情握手，一面说着：欢迎，欢迎。要把所有这类的事都写下来是不可能的，但有一点是很清楚的，经过战争与和平、殖民主义与反殖民主义的斗争的考验，中埃两国人民的友谊和了解加强了。　（12月13日）
