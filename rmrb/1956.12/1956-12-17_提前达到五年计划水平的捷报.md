    Good News of Achieving the Fifth Five-Year Plan Level Ahead of Schedule
    Nationwide Machine-Made Paper
    The output of machine-made paper in China's papermaking industry has reached the 1957 level ahead of schedule.
    By the end of November, the national output of machine-made paper reached 103.22% of the 1957 output, and the output value reached the 1957 level as early as August. The average pass rate of paper was 94%, which also reached the 1957 level. In addition, labor productivity, cost, and profit delivery are also close to the 1957 targets.
    The thirteen paper mills expanded during the first Five-Year Plan have been basically completed. Newly built paper mills have also been put into production. Over the past four years, papermaking industrial enterprises have successfully trial-produced more than 100 new products, such as electrolytic capacitor paper, steel paper, and type paperboard, which are indispensable and important materials for the machinery industry, automobile industry, and cultural publishing undertakings.
    Thirty-Five Products in Shanxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 15th: So far, the output of 35 products from industrial and mining enterprises in Shanxi Province has reached the 1957 production level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. These products include iron and three chemical products from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, paper from the Taiyuan Paper Mill, cement from the Taiyuan Cement Plant, as well as cotton cloth, coke, etc., from local state-owned industries included in the national plan. At the same time, the total output value of eleven state-owned factories and mines and one hundred and eighteen local state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines in the province has also reached the planned level for 1957 ahead of schedule.
    State-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the Shanxi area have carried out relatively systematic reforms of the original technical equipment and operating methods. For example, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was originally an old factory with outdated equipment. In recent years, only a small amount of investment has been used for partial reconstruction, which has enabled the blast furnace utilization coefficient of the plant to quickly catch up with the advanced level in the country.
    It is estimated that this year's steel production will increase by 12.8 times compared with the highest annual output before liberation (1943), and 1.43 times compared with 1952.
    In the first four years of the first Five-Year Plan, the average annual growth rate of local state-owned industry in Shanxi Province was also 3.12% faster than the rate stipulated in the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, the total output value level of local state-owned industry in the province reached the 1957 production level as early as the end of July this year, and 159 new products were trial-produced and produced during this period.
    Five Textile Enterprises in Shaanxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 15th: The main indicators such as total output value, yarn and cloth output, and quality of the five cotton textile enterprises in Shaanxi under the Northwest Textile Administration have all reached the 1957 level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan on average, and only the cost indicators of individual factories have not yet been achieved.
    The product quality of Shaanxi's cotton textile industry has greatly improved compared with the past. According to statistics from the five factories, by the end of November this year, the first-grade rate of first-grade cotton yarn had reached 87.36%, and the rate of superior and first-grade products of cotton cloth had also reached 99.12%, all exceeding the national plan.
    Four Tungsten Mines in Jiangxi
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 13th: The four state-owned tungsten mines of Pangushan, Huameiao, Hukeng, and Shangping have successively completed the total output value and output targets of the state's first Five-Year Plan and this year ahead of schedule and above quota.
    This year, in order to strive to complete the national plan ahead of schedule, these tungsten mines have widely and deeply carried out the advanced producer movement, and summarized and promoted many advanced experiences. This year, workers from Pangushan and Huameiao tungsten mines promoted twelve advanced experiences in stoping and tunneling, such as complex rock drilling, electric crushing, and straight-line blasting, which not only improved production efficiency but also ensured safe operation.

    提前达到五年计划水平的捷报
    全国的机制纸
    据新华社16日讯　我国造纸工业机制纸的产量已经提前达到1957年水平。
    到11月底，全国机制纸的产量达到1957年产量的103.22％，产值早在8月份达到了1957年的水平，纸的合格率平均为94％，也达到了1957年水平。此外，劳动生产率、成本、上缴利润等也都接近1957年指标。
    第一个五年计划中扩建的十三个造纸厂，已经基本完工。还有新建的造纸厂也投入生产。四年来，造纸工业企业试制成功了一百多种新产品，如电溶器纸、钢纸、字型纸板等都是机械工业、汽车工业、文化出版事业不可缺少的重要材料。
    山西三十五种产品
    据新华社太原15日电　到目前为止，山西省各工矿企业已经有三十五种产品的产量提前达到了五年计划规定的1957年生产水平。这些产品包括国营太原钢铁厂的铁和三种化学产品、太原造纸厂的纸、太原水泥厂的水泥，以及地方国营工业列入国家计划的棉布、焦炭等。同时，全省有十一个国营厂矿和一百十八个地方国营、公私合营厂矿的生产总值，也提前达到了1957年的计划水平。
    山西地区的国营和地方国营厂矿，曾对原有的技术设备和操作方法，进行了比较系统的改革。如太原钢铁厂原来是一个设备陈旧的工厂，几年来只利用少量投资进行了部分改建，就使这个厂高炉的利用系数已经迅速赶上全国的先进水平。
    今年钢铁的产量预计将比解放以前的最高年产量（1943年）提高十二点八倍，比1952年提高一点四三倍。
    在第一个五年计划的前四年中，山西省地方国营工业每年平均增长的速度，也比五年计划规定的速度加快了3.12％。因此，全省的地方国营工业早在今年7月底就提前达到了1957年的生产总值水平，并且在这期间试制和生产了一百五十九种新产品。
    陕西五个纺织企业
    据新华社西安15日电　西北纺织管理局所属陕西五个棉纺织企业的总产值、纱布产量和质量等项主要指标，平均都达到了五年计划规定的1957年的水平，只有成本指标个别工厂还未达到。
    陕西棉纺织工业的产品质量比过去有了很大提高。根据五个厂的统计，到今年11月底，一等一级棉纱的上品率已经达到87.36％，棉布的上等和一等产品率，也达到99.12％，都超过了国家计划。
    江西四个钨矿
    新华社南昌13日电　国营盘古山、画眉坳、浒坑、上坪等四个钨矿，已经先后提前超额完成了国家第一个五年计划和今年的总产值、产量指标。
    今年这些钨矿为了争取提前完成国家计划，广泛、深入地开展了先进生产者运动，总结和推广了许多先进经验。盘古山、画眉坳钨矿工人，今年在回采、掘进方面推广了复式凿岩、电气破、直线爆破等十二项先进经验，不但提高了生产效率而且保证了安全作业。
