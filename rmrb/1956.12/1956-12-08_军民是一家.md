The Army and the People Are One Family

Sending Him Fifty Li

Last spring, when the flowers were in bloom, Yang Zhongfu, a Miao platoon leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, was sent to Mabeng Township in Yunnan Province to do mass work. At that time, the temporary mutual aid teams in the township had already dissolved; the two year-round mutual aid teams had also collapsed. Coupled with the rumors and sabotage by bad elements, the thoughts of the local Miao and Yi compatriots fluctuated somewhat. After learning about this situation, Yang Zhongfu studied it with the township cadres and held separate meetings with tribal leaders and mass meetings to publicize the Party's cooperative policy and expose the rumors of bad elements. After repeated propaganda and a series of work, the masses' thinking changed, and the dissolved temporary and year-round mutual aid teams were quickly reorganized. Then, he helped the team members accumulate fertilizer and organized labor to invest in production. During the autumn harvest, the team members generally increased production.

This spring, the upsurge of agricultural cooperation reached Mabeng Township, and Yang Zhongfu went to Huadiping in the township to help build a cooperative. After the cooperative was established, he carefully studied some newly emerging problems, helped the cooperative improve the method of evaluating work points, suggested that everyone rationally allocate labor time, and actively helped the cooperative's cadres improve farming methods and promote advanced experience. When promoting advanced experience in single-plant close planting and double-plant close planting, the cooperative members had ideological resistance. Many people tried it for a period of time and then wavered again, and some elderly people even got angry. Yang Zhongfu was not discouraged and always patiently publicized and explained to everyone. Finally, advanced farming techniques were adopted on two-thirds of the cooperative's land. In order to accumulate fertilizer, he borrowed money for the cooperative members to buy pigs and sheep, and he personally spent six days and six nights burning three thousand catties of lime fertilizer for the cooperative. Once, when he returned from another place, he and the militiamen who accompanied him cut thirty catties of artemisia each and carried it back to the cooperative for fertilizer accumulation. Influenced by them, the youth of the cooperative accumulated more than 10,000 catties of fertilizer in less than a month.

Not long ago, when Yang Zhongfu went to Kunming to attend an activists' meeting held by the troops, some cooperative members sent him more than fifty li. They said:
"Comrade Yang, the Communist Party has pointed out the direction for us, and you specifically helped us embark on the socialist road!" Yang Zhongfu smiled and said, "Without the Communist Party, what could I do!" (Ma Xitang)

Fishing Boat and Patrol Ship

After completing its patrol mission, the patrol ship "August 1st" returned in stormy waves. The sky was gloomy, it was drizzling, and the wind howled across the sea. Signalman Wang Changchun discovered two blurry black spots drifting on the sea surface to the right rear from the lookout post. Deputy Captain Wang Changren looked through the binoculars and saw two small fishing boats, one of which was about to sink, and the other was being battered up and down by the huge waves coming from all directions. He immediately ordered the helmsman to change course to rescue the fishing boats.

The patrol ship got closer and closer to the small boat. A lot of water had poured into the cabin of one of the small boats, and the five people on board were half-submerged in the water. They tried hard to row towards the patrol ship. However, due to the large waves and the headwind, they moved forward one step and were pushed back two steps by the wind and waves. Helmsman Lin Zhizeng calmly maneuvered the patrol ship to the north side of the small boat, turned the ship's body sideways to block the wind, allowed the small boat to approach, and then threw down the cable to rescue the people. The sailors draped their coats over the fishermen, sent them to the boiler room to warm up, and brought out boiled water and biscuits for them to eat. The fishermen told the sailors that they were members of the Chenqianshan (island name) Fishery Production Cooperative outside Wusongkou and had encountered danger while fishing at sea. Later, the patrol ship sent the small boat back to Chenqianshan.

The next day, while returning to port, the patrol ship suddenly encountered dense fog, and suddenly even objects beyond fifty meters could not be seen. When everyone was anxious, a fishing boat on the right sea surface rowed toward the patrol ship. The people on board kept waving to the sailors and shouted loudly: "We are from the Chenqianshan Fishery Production Cooperative. We heard your whistle and rushed over immediately, fearing that you would get lost in the fog!" When everyone heard this, they all crowded onto the deck and waved to thank them. The fishing boat guided the patrol ship and returned along the safe route.

Friendship by the Lancang River

The engineering battalion came to Manzhangzhai in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province to conduct bridge-building training on the Lancang River. At this time, they learned that the local Dai people were worried about not being able to transport tens of thousands of catties of public grain due to insufficient horses. They decided to use the troops' vehicles to help the Dai people transport the grain to the district government on the way. From Manzhangzhai to the district government, it was less than 20 kilometers, and the vehicles quickly transported the public grain from several nearby villages.

The Dai people of Manzhangzhai were very grateful for the army's help. That night, the men, women, old, and children of the entire village played elephant-foot drums and gongs and held a get-together with the troops. From then on, the officers and soldiers of the engineering battalion and the local Dai people formed a close friendship.

Soon, the engineering battalion went to the Lancang River to carry out training tasks. Here, there were high mountains and cliffs on both sides, uninhabited, and inconvenient transportation, and food and vegetables could not be supplied. These difficult situations were quickly spread to Manzhangzhai. Someone proposed to immediately organize a caravan team to assist the troops in transportation. From Manzhangzhai to the Lancang River, this small caravan carried rice, vegetables, meat, etc. every day and delivered them to the troops on time.

The soldiers were very grateful for the enthusiastic support of the Dai people. Before leaving Manzhangzhai, they also helped local residents build a solid wooden bridge on an important transportation route. (Yun Zhong)

Military Doctor Like a "Miracle Doctor"

In Ali Prefecture, Tibet, there is a place called Baga. One day, Qiongbe Qiaodala, a Tibetan living here, suddenly fell ill. Both knees were swollen like steamed buns, and his bones ached excruciatingly. According to Tibetan customs, a lama was invited to the tent to recite a "disaster relief sutra," but the disease did not get better. Later, he asked some local doctors and foreign pilgrims to see him, but it was ineffective. Finally, the lama said to him: "You have to find the People's Liberation Army to treat this disease. If they can't cure it, it will never be cured."

Qiongbe Qiaodala asked someone to go to a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army more than two post stations away to find a doctor overnight. When military doctor Tan Fu saw the messenger, it was almost time for lights out. The outside was frighteningly dark, and the violent south wind was tighter than the other. Raindrops mixed with hail, hitting the mountains and the valleys. Tan Fu did not hesitate, he immediately packed his medicine kit, put on his raincoat, and rode his horse with the translator to set off with the messenger. He rushed to Qiongbe Qiaodala's tent that night. Dr. Tan did not rest, but immediately examined him, determined that it was acute rheumatic arthritis, gave him medicine, and stayed by the patient's side day and night. After seventy-two hours of treatment, the patient's swelling began to subside, and his bones were not so painful. He could walk with a red willow cane. Tan Fu observed for a few more days, confirmed that there was no problem, and left enough medicine before returning to the troops.

About a month later, Qiongbe Qiaodala's illness was completely cured. He sent Tan Fu a large yak, as well as Hada scarves, eight bricks of tea, and two hundred pounds of ghee, saying that it was for the "miracle doctor" and he would not leave unless he accepted it. From then on, the four words "Miracle Doctor Tan Fu" spread around Baga. Herdsmen seven or eight post stations away also rode yaks to find "Miracle Doctor" for treatment. (Attached picture)

Soldiers stationed on the frontline of coastal defense often explain current affairs to local fishermen. The left picture shows Private Li Youwen of a certain unit reading the news published in the People's Daily about the Chinese people's full support for Egypt to the fishermen. The right picture shows Private Liu Jizheng using his rest time to help fisherman Liu repair his fishing net.

　　军民是一家
    送他五十里
    去年春暖花开的时候，解放军某部苗族班长杨忠福被派到云南省的一个马崩乡去作群众工作。当时，这个乡的临时互助组已经解散；两个常年互助组，也垮了。再加上坏分子的造谣破坏，当地苗族、彝族同胞思想有些波动。杨忠福了解到这一情况后，就和乡干部一块研究，并分别召开了头人会议、群众会议，宣传党的合作政策，并揭发坏分子的谣言。经过反复宣传和一系列的工作，群众思想有了转变，已经解散的临时和常年互助组，很快又组织了起来。接着，就帮助组员积肥、组织劳动力投入生产。秋收时，组员普遍增了产。
    今春，农业合作化的高潮到了马崩乡，杨忠福就到这个乡的花底坪去帮助建社。社建立起来以后，他便细心研究一些新发生的问题，帮助社里改进评工分的方法，建议大家合理支配劳动时间，又积极帮助合作社的干部改进耕作方法，推广先进经验。在推广单株密植、双株密植的先进经验时，社员们的思想有抵触，不少人试了一个阶段，就又动摇起来，有些老年人还发脾气。杨忠福并没有灰心丧气，总是耐心地向大家宣传解释。终于，在这个社的三分之二的土地上，都采用了先进的耕作技术。为了积肥，他曾借款给社员买猪买羊，他还亲自花了六天六夜的功夫，给合作社烧了三千斤石灰肥。一次，他从别的地方回来，和同行的民兵每人割了三十斤青蒿，背回社里积肥。合作社的青年受了他们的影响，不到一个月，就积了一万多斤肥料。
    不久前，杨忠福到昆明参加部队召开的积极分子会议时，有些社员一直送他五十多里。他们说：
  “杨同志，共产党给我们指明了方向，还是你具体帮助我们走上了社会主义的大路啊！”杨忠福笑了笑，说：“要是没有共产党，我又能干个啥！”（马喜堂）
    鱼船和巡逻舰
      “八一”号巡逻舰完成巡逻任务以后，在惊涛骇浪中返航。天阴沉沉的，下着细雨，风呼呼地刮过海面。信号员王长春在了望台上发现右后方的海面上，有两个模糊的黑点在漂来漂去。副舰长王长仁用望远镜望去，看见是两只小渔船，有一只快要沉下去了，另一只也被四面八方涌来的巨浪打得一会儿高，一会儿低。他立即命令舵手改变航向去营救渔船。
    巡逻舰离小船越来越近，一只小船的舱里已经灌进了很多水，船上的五个人半个身子浸在水里，他们用力朝着巡逻舰划来。但是由于浪大，而且顶风，前进了一步，又被风浪顶回去两步。舵手林治增沉着地将巡逻舰绕到小船的北面，把舰身横过来挡住了风，让小船靠近，然后抛下了缆绳，把人救了上来。水兵们把自己的大衣披在渔民的身上，送他们到锅炉舱里取暖，拿出开水和饼干给他们吃。渔民们告诉水兵说，他们是吴淞口外陈钱山（岛名）渔业生产合作社的社员，因为出海捕鱼而遇险的。以后，巡逻舰把小船送回到陈钱山。
    第二天，巡逻舰在返航途中，忽然又遇漫天浓雾，顿时连五十公尺以外的东西都看不见了。当大家正在焦急不安的时候，右面海面上有一只渔船向巡逻舰划来，船上的人不断地向水兵们招手，还大声喊道：“我们是陈钱山渔业生产合作社的，听见你们的汽笛声，就马上赶来了，怕你们在雾里迷了路啊！”大家听说，就都拥到甲板上来，向他们招手致谢。渔船引导着巡逻舰，沿着安全的航路返航了。

    澜沧江边的友情
    工兵营来到了云南省西双版纳傣族自治州的蛮长寨，准备到澜沧江上去进行架桥训练。这时，他们了解到当地傣胞为着马匹不够，几万斤公粮运不完，正在发愁。他们决定利用部队的汽车，顺路帮助傣胞把粮食运到区政府去。从蛮长寨到区政府不到二十公里，汽车很快就把附近几个寨子的公粮运完了。
    蛮长寨的傣胞非常感谢军队的帮助。全寨男女老少当天晚上敲起了象脚鼓、芒锣，同部队开了一个联欢会。从此，工兵营官兵和当地傣胞结成了亲密的友谊。
    不久，工兵营到澜沧江上去执行训练任务。这里两边都是高山峭壁，没有人烟，交通不便，粮食蔬菜也供应不上。这些困难情况很快就传到了蛮长寨。有人提议马上组织一个马帮组，协助部队运输。从蛮长寨到澜沧江边，这支小马帮每天都驮着大米、蔬菜和肉类等，按时送到部队。
    士兵们对傣胞的热情支援非常感激。他们在离开蛮长寨以前，又帮助当地居民在一条交通要道上修筑了一座坚固的木桥。（允中）
    军医似“神医”
    在西藏阿里区，有一个地方叫巴噶。一天，住在这里的藏民穷别乔达拉忽然病了，两个膝盖肿得和馒头一样，骨头痛得钻心。照藏民的风俗习惯，曾请喇嘛到帐篷里来念了一场“消灾经”，但是病没有好。以后，他又找了一些当地的医生、外国香客来看，都不见效。最后，喇嘛对他说：“你这个病要找解放军治，他们治不好就永久治不好了。”
    穷别乔达拉连夜请人到两马站开外的解放军某部去找医生。军医谈福见到送信人时，快要吹熄灯号了。外面天色黑得怕人，狂暴的南风一阵比一阵紧，大雨点里夹着冰雹，打得山上山下响成一片。谈福没有迟疑，他立即收拾药包，披上雨衣，和翻译一块，骑着马，跟捎信人出发了。当夜赶到穷别乔达拉的帐篷，谈医生没有休息，马上给他检查，确定是急性风湿性关节炎，便给他吃药，并不分白天黑夜地守在病人身边。经过七十二小时的治疗，病人的肿开始消退，骨头也不太痛，拄根红柳棍可以走路了。谈福又观察了几天，肯定没有问题，便留下足够的药才回到部队。
    大概过了一个月，穷别乔达拉的病彻底好了，他给谈福送来一条大牦牛，还有哈达、八块砖茶和二百磅酥油，口口声声说是送给“神医”的，非收下他不走。从此以后，“神医谈福”这四个字便在巴噶一带流传着，距离七、八马站的牧民，也骑着牦牛去找“神医”看病。（附图片）
    驻守海防前线的士兵们经常给当地渔民讲解时事。左图是某部列兵李有文在给渔民读人民日报刊登的中国人民全力支援埃及的消息。右图是列兵刘吉正利用休息时间帮助渔民刘老大爷织补渔网。
