　　Fujian Oranges Blossom and Bear Fruit in Shandong

　　Old farmer Zhong Yansheng of Zhongjiakou Village, Lincheng District, Teng County, Shandong Province, planted the seeds of Fujian oranges he had eaten in flower pots, transplanted them to larger pots in the spring, and then transplanted them into jars after they were established. In the cold winter, he built sheds to protect them from the cold; when the weather warmed up, he dismantled the sheds. Over the past four years, the six established plants have successively blossomed and borne fruit. The two largest trees bore 114 oranges this year, and the other bore 107. These oranges have thin skins, are juicy, and taste sweet and fragrant, comparable to the best Fujian oranges.

    闽橘在山东开花结果
    山东省滕县临城区钟家口村老农民钟衍胜，把吃过的闽橘种子种在花盆里，到春天移栽到大盆，定植后又移栽到缸内。冬天寒冷的时候搭棚御冷；天暖了，将棚拆去。近四年来，定植的六株已陆续开花结果。最大的两棵，今年一棵结了一百一十四枚橘子，另一棵结了一百零七枚。这些橘子，皮薄水多，味甜香，能比上顶好的闽橘。
