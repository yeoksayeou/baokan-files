Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 18th: Over the past six months, various regions of Henan Province have dispatched more than 800 cadres to visit mountainous areas, helping the people in these areas solve many urgent problems on the spot.

The 60-member visiting group organized by the CPC Linxian Committee included eleven county committee members. The visiting group visited 57 agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperatives in the mountainous areas. Among these cooperatives, 26,597 people in 29 cooperatives still have difficulty accessing drinking water, with some having to travel more than ten li to fetch water. After learning about this situation, the visiting group decided that the county would invest 20,000 yuan to help local people build small-scale projects such as reservoirs and dry wells to solve the drinking water problem. The supply and marketing department personnel in Songxian County, located in the Funiu Mountains, immediately established supply points in the remote mountainous areas after hearing an old woman say that she had to travel more than forty li to buy cotton. Some learned about the local specialties in the remote mountainous areas during the visits and signed contracts to guarantee the supply and sales of these local products. Others discovered the difficulties of the mountain people in lacking grain and cotton and tried to help solve them. At the same time, according to statistics, the visiting groups from Linxian, Yiyang, Bo'ai, Jixian, Jiyuan, and other counties also provided free medical treatment to more than 11,300 people in the mountainous areas and distributed more than 29,000 yuan in relief funds.

The visits have now ended. The opinions raised by the people in the mountainous areas are being sorted out, analyzed, studied, and addressed.

    河南各地派出大批工作人员访问山区
    就地帮助山区人民克服困难
    新华社郑州18日电　河南省各地半年来派出了八百多个干部深入山区访问，帮助山区人民就地解决了许多迫切的困难问题。
    中共林县委员会组成的六十人的访问团中，有十一个是县委委员。访问团访问了山区五十七个农、林、牧业生产合作社。在这些合作社中，目前还有二十九个社的两万六千五百九十七人吃水很困难，有的要跑十多里路去取水。访问团了解这种情况后，决定由县里投资两万元帮助当地群众修建蓄水池、旱井等小型工程，以解决吃水困难。伏牛山区的嵩县供销部门人员，在访问中听到一位老太太说要跑四十多里路去买棉花以后，立即在深山区增设了供应点。有的在访问过程中了解了深山区的土特产情况，并且签订合同保证这些土特产的供销。有的发现山区人民缺粮、缺棉的困难，也设法帮助解决。同时，据统计，林县、宜阳、博爱、汲县、济源等县的访问团还免费帮助山区一万一千三百多人医治了疾病，并且发放了两万九千多元救济款。
    现在各地访问已经结束。山区人民群众提出的意见正在进行整理、分析、研究和处理。
