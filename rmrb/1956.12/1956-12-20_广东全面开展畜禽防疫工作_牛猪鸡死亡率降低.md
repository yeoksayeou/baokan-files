    Guangdong Fully Launches Livestock and Poultry Disease Prevention Work; Mortality Rate of Cattle, Pigs and Chickens Decreases

    (Our report) This year, Guangdong Province has comprehensively carried out disease prevention injections for livestock and poultry, greatly reducing the mortality rate of draught cattle, pigs, and chickens. The number of draught cattle that died from various infectious diseases this year decreased by 42.8% compared to last year; last year, 630,000 pigs died throughout the province, while this year, as of October, only 300,000 had died; the number of chicken deaths has also significantly decreased compared to last year.

    Guangdong Province's livestock and poultry disease prevention work relies on the combined efforts of 53 livestock and veterinary technology promotion stations and more than 47,000 prevention and treatment personnel, quarantine officers, traditional Chinese veterinarians, and feeders. They have collectively injected vaccines against diseases such as swine plague, swine erysipelas, cattle plague, and chicken plague into more than 1,980,000 livestock and poultry for farmers. At the same time, quarantine and epidemic area blockades are being carried out with emphasis. Currently, various localities are preparing to train a large number of veterinary grassroots personnel in preparation for launching a mass disease prevention campaign next spring. (Li Shaoqiu)

    广东全面开展畜禽防疫工作
    牛猪鸡死亡率降低
    本报讯　广东省今年全面开展了家畜家禽的防疫注射，耕牛、毛猪和鸡的死亡率大大降低。今年因患各种传染病而死亡的耕牛比去年减少42.8％；去年全省死亡的猪达六十三万只，今年到10月为止，仅死亡三十万头；鸡的死亡数也比去年大为减少。
    广东省的家畜家禽防疫工作是依靠五十三个畜牧兽医技术推广站、四万七千多个防治员、检疫员、中兽医、饲养员等协力进行的，他们总共为农民的一百九十八万多只畜禽注射了防治猪肺疫、猪丹毒、牛瘟、鸡瘟等疫病的疫苗，同时，有重点地进行检疫和疫区封锁。目前，各地正准备大量训练兽医基层人员，准备明春开展群众性的防疫运动。　　　　　　　（李少球）
