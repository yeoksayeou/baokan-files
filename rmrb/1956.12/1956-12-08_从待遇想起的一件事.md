Title: A Story Inspired by Treatment

The word "treatment" isn't foreign to us; we're all very familiar with it. In the past, when we were fighting as guerrillas, people also talked about treatment, which at that time was called political treatment. Today's treatment isn't simply political treatment anymore; it also includes economic issues, making the problem even more complex.

Recently, during the wage reform, some people were very dissatisfied with their rank, which is, of course, also a treatment issue.

I think it's alright for a worker or a clerk to speak out if they're not satisfied with their rank. Our country's wage policy is based on the principle of "to each according to his work, more work more pay." As long as someone does more work and bears greater responsibilities than others, the state should give them higher compensation. However, this matter made me think of something else.

In July this year, I met an old friend in Harbin. He was still doing his old job as a reporter for the Harbin Daily. Old friends reuniting always brings endless conversation. The content of our conversation was indeed very broad, ranging from the Harbin Daily to the "internal news of our newspaper" article, from basic construction to increasing production and practicing economy. When we talked about the progress of the first Five-Year Plan, he repeatedly recommended an advanced producer from a railway factory to me. He repeatedly promoted this worker, named Su Guangming, a milling worker who, starting in July this year, had already begun working on the second half of 1958. Finally, under my friend's enthusiastic encouragement, I ran to Su Guangming's house.

When I entered Su Guangming's house, I knew immediately that his wife must be a very thrifty person. The two rooms weren't large, but they were neatly arranged, making people feel both simple and comfortable. In the small courtyard in front of the door, a small garden was arranged. There was a lilac tree at the entrance, and next to the tree was a small flower bed with passionflowers in bloom, their fragrance drilling straight into one's lungs. Morning glories climbed the walls and yard, weaving a canopy in the sky. The sandy soil in the yard was swept as smooth and bright as a tabletop. Therefore, when I sat down in this small courtyard, I paid special attention to Su Guangming's wife.

Su Guangming had a square build and a round face, finding it hard to speak to people. If you asked him three questions, he could only answer one, and sometimes he wouldn't answer at all, just laughing dryly. But his wife, Ma Lizhen, was different. She had a pair of large, dark, and bright eyes, and spoke eloquently, answering every question and never getting confused.

She first introduced her children to me. Her eldest son was taking the university entrance exam this year, her daughter was in the second year of high school, and her youngest daughter was in elementary school. Then she talked about her husband, saying that her husband had a very strange temper, finding it hard to speak to people, never opening his mouth about big or small matters, and just burying himself in his work. She didn't mention a word about herself. In fact, although she was a family member, the work she undertook was no less than that of her husband.

Ma Lizhen held many positions: member of the street committee for culture and education, Party propagandist, teacher in the family literacy class, volunteer librarian at the railway factory club. However, these positions still couldn't fully explain her work. We only need to know her daily schedule to know how she works. She gets up at four-thirty every day, busy cooking, preparing meals for her husband to eat before going to work, and for her son and daughter to eat before going to school. After washing the pots and dishes, it's exactly seven o'clock in the morning, and she goes to participate in obstetric study at the factory hospital, which is to help family members give birth. She comes back at nine o'clock to correct homework for the students, goes to the literacy class to teach at twelve o'clock, and comes back at two o'clock, stopping by the market to buy groceries and cook. After five o'clock, she also participates in night school. From seven to nine o'clock, it is her time to be on duty at the club library. After nine o'clock, she still has an hour to prepare lessons, because she only went to elementary school when she was young, and relying solely on learning at night school is not enough to teach well in the literacy class, so she has to take advantage of the lesson preparation time to learn from her son and daughter, making up for her shortcomings. In addition, there is also street work, propaganda work, which is even more unnecessary to talk about, as it is unscheduled, done whenever there is something to do. We can calculate that her daily working hours should be considered not light, right? It is indeed no less than that of a national staff member.

Ma Lizhen is a worker's family member. She is neither a member of the Youth League nor a Party member, nor is she a national staff member. She is an ordinary worker's family member.

Ma Lizhen has never thought about the word "treatment." What she asks for is work. She loves her work. She feels that being able to do a little more work is her glory.

Some people may say that Ma Lizhen is different from our general working comrades. I say, how is she different? I can only say that Ma Lizhen is an ordinary worker's family member, a most ordinary citizen. The work she does is all voluntary work. She doesn't even know what "treatment" is. We wear the badge of a state employee on our chest, so our demands are higher.

### 从待遇想起的一件事

    从待遇想起的一件事
    陈登科
    待遇这两字，在我们脑子里，并不生疏，我们都非常熟悉。过去，打游击的时候，人也谈待遇，那时的待遇，叫政治待遇；今天的待遇，不是单纯的政治待遇了，还包含着经济问题，因此问题也就更加复杂化了。
    近来，工资改革中，有的人为着级别高低，情绪上大为不满，当然也是待遇问题。
    我想，一个工人，一个机关职员，对自己级别不满意，出来说说话，不是不可以的，我们国家的工资政策，是按劳取酬，多劳多得，只要工作做得多，负的责任比别人重大，国家所给他的报酬就应该高些。不过我从这件事，又想到另外一件事了。
    今年7月里，我在哈尔滨遇到一位旧友，他还是干的老行当，在哈尔滨日报做记者。旧友重逢，见面时总有谈不完之感。我们谈话的内容，确实也太广了，从哈尔滨日报扯到“本报内部消息”那篇文章，从基本建设谈到增产节约。当谈到第一个五年计划所完成的程度时，他一再向我推荐铁路工厂一位先进生产者。他再三地向我宣传，这位工人，叫苏广铭，是一名铣工，从今年7月起，已开始做1958年的下半年的工作了。我终于在这位朋友热心鼓动下，跑到苏广铭的家里。
    当我走进苏广铭家里一看，就知道他的爱人，一定是非常勤俭的人。两间屋子并不大，收拾得挺干净的，使人看起来既朴素，又舒坦。门前小院子里，布置成小小的花园，迎门有株丁香树，树旁有个小小的花坛，西番莲正开，那股清香，直往人肺里钻。喇叭花，爬上墙院，在天空织成天篷。院子里的沙土地，扫得像桌面一样的光滑亮堂。因此，当我在这个小院子里坐下的时候，就特别的注意了苏广铭的爱人。
    苏广铭四方方的身材，圆圆的脸，见人难开口，问他三句，只能回你一句，有时一句也不回，只干笑笑了事。就是他的爱人马丽珍特别些，一双大眼睛，黑而发亮，讲话伶牙俐齿，百问百答，千句不乱。
    她先向我介绍她的孩子。大儿子今年投考大学，闺女进高二，小女儿在小学里读书；然后就谈她的丈夫，说她丈夫，脾性很怪，见人难开口，大事小事，从不开口，埋头工作。有关她自己，只字未提。其实她虽是一个家属，所担负的工作，并不少于她的丈夫。
    马丽珍一身的职务有好多，街道委员会文教委员，党的宣传员，家属扫盲班教员，铁路工厂俱乐部义务图书员，但是，这些还并不能说明她的工作。我们只要知道她每天的时间的安排，就知道她是怎样工作的了。她每天四点半钟就起身，忙着烧饭，把饭烧好，忙给丈夫吃了上班，儿子、闺女吃了上学校；待自己洗好锅碗，正好是上午七点钟，去参加工厂医院的产科学习，这种学习，是为着帮助家属接生。九点钟回来替学员批改作业，十二点钟到扫盲班里去上课，两点钟回来，顺便走菜市买菜做饭。五点钟以后，自己还参加夜校学习。七点到九点，是她在俱乐部图书馆值班的时间。九点钟以后，还有一小时的备课时间，因她从小只念过小学，光靠在夜校里学习，在扫盲班里教不下课，还得利用备课的时间，向儿子和闺女学习，弥补自己的不足。此外，还有什么街道工作，宣传员工作，就更不用谈了，那是不定时的，什么时候有，就什么时候做。我们可以算算，她每天的工作时间，也该说是不轻了吧？确也不少于我们一个国家的职员。
    马丽珍，是一个工人家属，她既不是团员，又不是党员，也不是国家的职员，是一个普通的工人家属。
    马丽珍从来没有想到待遇两字，她要求的是工作，她热爱她的工作，她觉得她能多做一点工作，是她的光荣。
    也有人会说，马丽珍与我们一般的工作同志不同。我说她不同在那里呢？那只能说，马丽珍是一个普通的工人家属，是一个最普通的公民，她所做的工作，都是义务工作，她还不知什么叫待遇，我们胸前是挂着国家职员的证章，要求也就要高些。
