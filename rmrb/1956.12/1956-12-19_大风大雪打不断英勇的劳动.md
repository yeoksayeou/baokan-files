Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 18th: At the Yangtze River Bridge construction site
　　
The continuous strong winds and heavy snow have turned the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site into a frigid zone, but the construction activities throughout the site have not been interrupted for a moment. Even the riveters and riggers working high above the river surface at fifty or sixty meters, and the divers working underwater at depths of twenty or thirty meters, have not stopped their heroic labor to complete the bridge project ahead of schedule, despite the inclement weather of wind and snow.

The builders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge had already completed this year's construction and installation tasks ahead of schedule half a month ago. Since then, they have started work on the 1957 tasks. Up to now, the abutment projects of the approach bridges on both banks have been completed; of the eight mid-river piers, four have been fully completed, and two more will reach the design elevation in the near future. The steel beams of the entire bridge are divided into three sections with nine spans. Currently, one section of three spans on the Hanyang bank has been basically erected, and one span of the section of three spans on the Wuchang bank is also nearing completion. The workers are actively responding to the call of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau Committee of the Communist Party of China: strive to complete 113% of the annual national plan.

The ability of the bridge builders to persist in construction despite the severe cold, and to keep the entire project moving forward non-stop, is inseparable from the fact that the Party and government leadership of the Engineering Bureau prepared conditions for cold-weather construction for them early on. Since October, the Engineering Bureau leadership has successively made 5,000 cotton overcoats and cotton jackets for the workers working outdoors and at high altitudes. In addition, many anti-skid and heating equipment have been added to create material conditions for winter operations for the workers. The Party and government leading cadres and Soviet experts of the Engineering Bureau often go to the construction site to guide and inspect the work, which greatly encouraged the builders' confidence and courage to fight against the severe cold.

Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, December 18th: In the Greater Khingan Mountains
　　
In the Greater Khingan Mountains, where the temperature is below minus thirty degrees, thousands of workers are building highways and railways through the deep mountains and dense forests. The workers repairing highways are cutting down trees on the road surface and digging up tree roots in the deep snow. The workers repairing railways are blasting stone and digging earthwork, and stepping up the construction of roadbed projects. The construction of more than 20,000 square meters of new houses this year is underway, including interior installation, painting, and flooring.

This year, nearly 100,000 square meters of houses and five highways, and three forest railways are to be built in the Greater Khingan Mountains. By the end of September, only 63% of these projects had been completed. However, after more than two months of winter construction in October and November, most of them have now been completed, some highways have begun to transport materials, some railways have been opened to traffic, and more than 2,300 workers and their families have moved into the more than 60,000 square meters of houses newly built this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 17th: On the transmission lines
　　
The pole erection project of the Zhengzhou-Luoyang-Sanmenxia power grid from Zhengzhou to Luoyang has been basically completed.

On this construction line, which is more than 100 kilometers long, workers are erecting high-voltage transmission lines in the severe cold.

On December 10, the construction site was windy and snowy, but construction did not stop along the entire line, and many workers completed the task of erecting poles on schedule. By December 13, 15 kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines had been erected.

    大风大雪打不断英勇的劳动
    在长江大桥工地
    新华社武汉18日电　连日大风、大雪使武汉长江大桥工地变成了严寒之区，但是整个工地的建设活动却一刻也没有间断过。就是在高出江面五、六十公尺的高空从事架梁工作的拼铆工和装吊工们，以及钻到水下二、三十公尺的深处从事水下作业的潜水员们，在风雪交加的天气里，也没有终止他们为提前完成大桥工程的英勇劳动。
    武汉长江大桥的建设者们，在半个月以前就已经把今年的建筑、安装任务提前完成了。从那以后，就开始了1957年的工作。到现在，两岸引桥桥墩工程已经全部完成；八个江心桥墩，有四个已经全部完工，还有两个将在最近期内达到设计标高。全桥钢梁分三联九孔。目前，汉阳岸的一联三孔已经基本上架完，武昌岸的一联三孔中，有一孔也已经接近完成。职工们正以积极的行动响应中共武汉长江大桥工程局委员会的号召：争取完成年度国家计划的113％。
    桥梁建设者们能够在严寒的袭击中坚持施工，使整个工程不停地向前推进，是同工程局的党、政领导方面及早地为他们准备好了抗寒施工的条件分不开的。十月以来，工程局领导方面先后制作了五千件棉大衣、棉夹克，供给在户外和高空工作的职工们穿用。此外，还添置了许多防滑取暖设备，为职工们创造冬季作业的物质条件。工程局的党、政领导干部和苏联专家，经常到施工现场指导和检查工作，也大大地鼓舞了建设者们向严寒搏斗的信心和勇气。
    在大兴安岭
    新华社牙克石18日电　在零下三十多度的大兴安岭，上千名职工正在穿越深山密林建设着公路和铁路。修公路的工人们在深雪中紧张地砍伐着路面上的树木和挖掘着树根。修铁路的工人们，正在爆破石方和挖土方，加紧修筑路基工程。今年新建的两万多平方公尺面积的房屋，正在进行内部安装、刷粉和铺地板等工作。
    今年，大兴安岭地区要建设近十万平方公尺的房屋和五条公路，三条森林铁路。这些工程到9月末只完成63％。但是，经过10、11两个多月的冬季施工，现在已经大部分完工，有的公路开始运材，有的铁路已经通车，两千三百多户职工和他们的家属也已经搬进了今年新建的六万多平方公尺的住宅。
    在输电线路上
    据新华社郑州17日电　郑州——洛阳——三门峡电力网郑州到洛阳一段的竖杆工程，已经基本完成。
    在这段长达一百多公里的施工线上，职工们正在冒着严寒架设高压输电线。
    12月10日，工地上风雪交加，全线没有停止施工，许多工人都按期完成了竖杆的任务。到12月13日，已经架设起来的高压输电线已有十五公里。
