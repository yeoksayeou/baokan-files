    Expanding the Technological Achievements of the "Caisson Drilling Method"
    China and the Soviet Union Establish a Scientific Research Base for the Wuhan Bridge in Wuhan
    (Our newspaper dispatch) In accordance with the suggestion of Comrade Levin, head of the Soviet Railway Science Delegation, and with the agreement and approval of both the Chinese and Soviet Railway Transportation Science Research Institutes, the Wuhan Bridge Scientific Research Base has been established in Wuhan.
    The Wuhan Bridge Scientific Research Base is jointly organized and led by Comrade Silin, head of the Soviet Expert Working Group of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, and Wang Juqian, Chief Engineer of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, with engineers Zhou Yiqing and Zhao Haiqing dispatched by the Railway Science Research Institute participating in the work.
    The establishment of the Wuhan Bridge Scientific Research Base will not only further study the advantages of the "Caisson Drilling Method" in order to improve the scientific level of bridge construction, but also broaden the application of the "Caisson Drilling Method." Comrade Silin pointed out that this large-diameter caisson can replace vertical shafts in the coal mining industry; in water conservancy projects, it can be used to build waterproof cofferdams and seaport docks; and it can even be developed for use in the foundations of other large-scale buildings.
    The task of the Wuhan Bridge Scientific Research Base for next year is based on the eight main projects in the bridge foundation engineering work plan proposed by Soviet experts, which have been approved by the scientific institutions of both China and the Soviet Union. The topics of future scientific research papers will be assigned jointly by Chinese and Soviet technical personnel in a coordinated manner. (According to the Yangtze River Daily)

    扩大“管柱钻孔法”技术成就
    中苏两国在武汉建立武汉大桥科学研究基点
    本报讯　根据苏联铁道科学代表团团长列文同志的建议，经中苏双方铁道运输科学研究院同意和批准，在武汉成立了武汉大桥科学研究基点。
    武汉大桥科学研究基点，是由武汉长江大桥工程局苏联专家工作组组长西林和武汉长江大桥工程局总工程师汪菊潜共同负责组织领导，由铁道科学研究院派来的周翼青、赵海清两位工程师参加工作。
    武汉大桥科学研究基点的建立，不但能更进一步研究“管柱钻孔法”的优越性，以便提高桥梁建筑的科学水平；而且能使“管柱钻孔法”的用途更加广泛。西林同志指出：这种大口径管柱在采煤工业上可以代替竖井；在水利工程中可以建筑防水围堰、海港码头；甚至可以发展到使用于其他大型建筑的基础上。
    武汉大桥科学研究基点明年的任务，是根据苏联专家提出的桥梁基础工程工作规划中的八个主要项目，这些项目已经由中苏双方科学机构核准。今后的科学研究论文题目将由中苏两国技术人员互相配合分工来作。（据长江日报）
