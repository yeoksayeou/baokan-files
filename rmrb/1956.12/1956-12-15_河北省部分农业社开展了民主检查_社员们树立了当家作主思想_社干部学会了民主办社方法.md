Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 12th. Hebei Province has begun to rectify agricultural cooperatives with a focus on current production. The main purpose of this rectification is to mobilize members to carry out democratic inspections, summarize the experiences and lessons learned from running the cooperatives and increasing production over the past year, in order to further consolidate and improve the agricultural cooperatives.

As of now, 93 cooperatives in five counties, including Zunhua and Fengrun in the Tangshan area, have completed their democratic inspections. In the democratic inspection, members of the Lianggezhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Changli County put forward more than 200 suggestions for improving the work within the cooperative and the leadership style of the cooperative cadres; many members also examined their own shortcomings of not working hard and not observing labor discipline, and expressed their intention to correct them in the future. Through this inspection, the members established the idea of being masters of their own affairs, and the cooperative cadres also learned democratic methods of running the cooperatives. After the Xinglongzhuang Fuqiang Agricultural Cooperative in Luan County carried out democratic inspections, the labor enthusiasm of the members was greatly improved, and each production team immediately formulated winter production plans.

Based on the problems exposed in the autumn harvest distribution, the organization of the agricultural cooperatives has been focused on in the rectification process. In Baoding Prefecture, some of the larger joint-village cooperatives have been appropriately reduced in size according to the requirements of the members, based on the principles of being conducive to production, unity, leadership, and promoting democracy. In Xushui County, 50 joint-village cooperatives that could not continue to operate were divided up this time, and a busy winter scene appeared. According to production needs, the Luhebao Agricultural Cooperative in Chicheng County, Zhangjiakou Prefecture, reduced the size of the original, larger production teams, making the team leader's leadership more specific and in-depth, and the members' production enthusiasm was also increased. Currently, each production team has launched a fertilizer accumulation competition.

These agricultural cooperatives that have begun to be rectified have also democratically re-elected the leadership bodies of the cooperatives. In the 190 cooperatives in the Tianjin area that have been rectified, cooperative cadres who are active in their work and care about the members have been praised by the members, those with shortcomings in their work have been criticized, and a small number of people with bad work styles, who repeatedly refuse to be corrected, and who have degenerated, have been replaced. In the Longhuzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yongqing County, 17 fair and capable cadres were commended; after two cadres with shortcomings were criticized and made self-criticisms, they were re-elected as leaders of the cooperative.

Under the leadership of the Party branch and the cooperative affairs committee, the agricultural cooperatives that have begun to be rectified in various places have boldly mobilized the masses and reasonably resolved the outstanding economic problems within the cooperatives. In the 34 agricultural cooperatives in the Mahe area of Xingtai County that have been rectified, 32 cooperatives originally forced members to join the cooperative with fruit trees. During this rectification, more than 900 scattered fruit trees were returned to the members according to their wishes. The members felt satisfied.

    河北省部分农业社开展了民主检查
    社员们树立了当家作主思想  社干部学会了民主办社方法
    新华社保定12日电　河北省各地已经开始结合当前生产有重点地整顿农业社。这次整社主要是发动社员开展民主检查，总结一年来办社和增产的经验教训，以便进一步巩固和提高农业社。
    到目前止，唐山专区的遵化、丰润等五个县已经有九十三个社结束了民主检查。昌黎县梁各庄农业社的社员们，在民主检查中提出了两百多条改进社内工作、改进社干部领导作风的意见；还有不少社员检查了自己不好劳动、不遵守劳动纪律的缺点，表示今后改正。通过这次检查，社员们树立了当家作主的思想，也使社干部学会了民主办社的方法。滦县兴隆庄富强农业社开展民主检查以后，社员劳动积极性大大提高，各生产队立即订出了冬季生产计划。
    根据秋收分配中暴露出来的问题，各地在整社中着重整顿了农业社的组织。保定专区有一部分规模偏大的联村社，根据社员要求，本着有利生产、有利团结、便于领导和发扬民主的原则，已经适当地划小。徐水县原来有五十个不能继续办下去的联村社，这次分开以后都出现了冬忙景象。张家口专区赤城县吕和堡农业社根据生产需要，把原来偏大的生产队划小以后，队长领导具体、深入了，社员生产情绪也高了，目前各生产队都展开了积肥竞赛。
    这些开始整顿的农业社，还民主改选了社的领导机构。天津专区在已经整顿过的一百九十个社中，工作积极，关心社员的社干部都受到了社员的表扬，工作有缺点的也受到了批评，少数作风恶劣、屡教不改和蜕化变质的人被撤换了。永清县龙虎庄农业社，有十七名公道能干的干部受到了表扬；两个有缺点的干部在受到批评和本人作了检讨以后，重新当选了社的领导人。
    在党支部和社务委员会的领导下，各地开始整顿的农业社都放手发动群众，合理地解决了社内遗留的经济问题。邢台县马河片经过整顿的三十四个农业社中，原来有三十二个社强求社员果树入社，在这次整顿中，按照社员意见将九百多棵零星果树退给社员。社员感到满意。
