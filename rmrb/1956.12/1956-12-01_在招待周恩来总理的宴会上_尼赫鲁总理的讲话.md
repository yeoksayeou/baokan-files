About two and a half years ago, the Chinese Premier came to our city but left quickly. At that time, we warmly welcomed him. Now he has come again, and although this time his stay will be longer than last time, it will not be very long. We are gathered here to extend a warm welcome to him. But the real welcome for him is the welcome given to him by the people on the streets of Delhi, which he has seen with his own eyes. Wherever he goes in our country, whether it is in Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Madras, Calcutta, or in our villages, he will receive the same welcome from our people. He will personally see how much our people love him and his country, and hear the same slogan that is now getting louder and louder, which is "Hindi-Chini bhai bhai" (Indians and Chinese are brothers).

There is a thousand-mile-long border between our two countries. But high walls have been built between us. Now these high walls are collapsing. Many people from our country go to China, and many people from China come to this country. Many people from our country go there to study, understand, and learn, and we have also learned a lot from there.

Your country (China) is very large. Our country is also large, although not as large as yours. There are many things that unite us and many things that make us diverse. There are many kinds of languages in our country, and many kinds of costumes, but together they form the commonality of this country. If this diversity can still maintain the unity of a country, then it is not surprising that there are still many similarities between our two countries despite the inconsistencies.

If the whole world becomes uniform and monotonous, people's interest in it will also decrease. The beauty of this world lies in the diversity of its paths. But this diversity should not lead to conflict, but should unite the world. This conflict should be stopped, and that is precisely the task before us.

It is because of these facts that our two countries have accepted Panchsheel—the Five Principles. These principles clearly stipulate how all countries in the world should move forward together. Nothing can be decided through conflict. Regardless of the responsibility of others, the responsibility of our two countries is the greatest, because it is our two countries that first announced Panchsheel—the Five Principles. The word Panchsheel is not a new word. In the past, this word was used for similar purposes. When we commemorate the Nirvana of Sakyamuni, we remember this point. At that time, the emphasis was entirely on human behavior. Sakyamuni emphasized that people should be loving and kind.

In this era, we use this word for national relations. But if that spiritual quality is lacking, if there is no brotherly love, then Panchsheel cannot develop for a long time.

Today, the world is disturbed, and its problems are complicated. Some conflicts have already occurred, and people worry that more conflicts will occur. The goal of our efforts is to eliminate this threat of war. If we fail to do this, then all our efforts will be fruitless.

We all know how your country (China) strives for peace and how patiently it acts. We have made the same efforts, and other countries have made the same efforts. We all demand that these gathering war clouds should be eliminated. I hope that your country, your people, and our country, our people, will continue to strive for peace.

I once again express my respect to you, and at the same time, I hope that you will feel happy during your short stay in this country, and that you will take away our warm love for you.

Now I propose a toast to Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long.

### 在招待周恩来总理的宴会上　尼赫鲁总理的讲话

　　在招待周恩来总理的宴会上
　　尼赫鲁总理的讲话
    约在两年半以前，中国总理来到了我们这个城市，但是很快就离开了。那时候，我们曾经热烈地欢迎他。现在他又来了，虽然这次逗留的时间比上次要长一些，但是也不会很长。我们聚集在这里对他表示热烈的欢迎。但是给他的真正欢迎，是他亲眼看到的德里街道上的人民所给他的欢迎。在我们国家内，不论他到那里，不论是在孟买、浦那、班加罗尔、孟德拉斯、加尔各答或是在我们的村庄里，他都将受到我国人民同样的欢迎。他将亲自看到我国人民怎样热爱他和他的国家，并且听到现在愈来愈响亮的同一个口号，这个口号就是“印地秦尼巴依巴依”（印中人民是兄弟）。
    在我们两国之间有一千英里长的疆界。但是在我们之间曾经筑起了高墙。现在这些高墙正在倾塌。我国有许多人到中国去，中国也有许多人到这个国家来。我国有许多人到那边去求学、了解和学习，我们也从那里学到了许多东西。
    你们的国家（中国）十分大。我们的国家也很大，虽然没有你们的那样大。在我们国家里，统一的地方很多，多样的地方也很多。我国语言的种类很多，服装的种类也很多，但是汇合起来形成了这个国家的共同性。如果这种多样性仍然能够保持一个国家的统一的话，那么在我们两国之间尽管有不一致的地方，而仍然有许多相似的地方，那就不值得惊奇了。
    假如整个世界变得一式一样千篇一律的话，人们对它的兴趣也会减少。这个世界的美就在于它的道路的多样性。但是这种多样性不应该导致冲突，而应该使世界团结。应该制止这种冲突，而这正就是我们面前的任务。
    正是由于这些事实，我们两国接受了潘查希拉——五项原则。这些原则明确地规定世界各国应该一起前进。通过冲突，是什么也决定不了的。不论别人的责任怎样，我们两国的责任是最大的，因为正是我们两国首先宣布潘查希拉——五项原则。潘查希拉这个词并不是一个新词。在过去为了类似的目的曾经用过这个词。当我们纪念释迦牟尼涅般的时候，我们想起了这一点。当时是完全强调人的行为。释迦牟尼强调了人应该博爱和善良。
    在这个时代，我们把这个词用在国家关系上面。但是假如缺乏那种精神品质的话，假如没有博爱的话，那么潘查希拉是不可能长期发展的。
    今天，世界受到了扰乱，它的问题是错综复杂的。有些冲突已经发生了，人们担心还会发生更多的冲突。我们努力的目标就是消除这种战争威胁。假如我们做不到这一点，那么我们的一切努力都将毫无结果。
    我们每个人都知道你们的国家（中国）如何为和平而努力，如何耐心地行事。我们也作了同样的努力，其它国家也做了同样的努力。我们都要求这些正在密集着的战争乌云应该加以消除。我希望你们的国家、你们的人民和我们的国家、我们的人民将继续为和平而奋斗。
    我再一次地向您表示敬意，同时我希望，您在这个国家逗留的不多的日子里将感到愉快，而且您将带去我们对您的热爱的盛情。
    现在我提议为周恩来总理和贺龙副总理干杯。
