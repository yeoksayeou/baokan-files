    On the Road
  　Bai Shu

  　A valiant young rider, straddling a chestnut horse, golden badge gleaming on his chest, carries the morning glow. The rider gallops towards the village, like a sailboat speeding across the sea nearing the port of Penglai Island, the fields unfold into a golden ocean. It is the season of harvest, exuding an intoxicating fragrance of rice, overflowing with the joy of labor, everywhere is filled with happy singing; people sing of love from the bottom of their hearts, people sing of wishes from the bottom of their hearts; in the past, it was tattered and shabby, but now the cattle and sheep also have new houses. The silver bell rings to the edge of the orchard, from the fruit grove comes a group of girls, with red faces and colorful clothes, even more beautiful than a peacock spreading its tail; this girl holds a jackfruit, that girl holds a *guoshanxiang* [note]; "Comrade, take a break, please taste the fruit of our cooperative!" The rider bows slightly and reins in his horse, dashing up the hill with a whoosh, leaving behind a sentence in a flash: "Thank you, my girl!" Which of the girls thinks of the loved one in her heart, in the distant, distant frontier, that sweet smile, then lightly adorns her eyebrows.
        July 28, 1956, on the Guangwu train.
  [Note] *Guoshanxiang* is a kind of banana.

    路上
  　白曙骁勇的年轻骑手，跨在枣红马上，胸前金章闪闪，带着早晨的霞光；骑手纵马驰近村庄，像海上疾驶的船帆靠拢了蓬莱岛港，田原展开金色的海洋。丰收的季节啊，散发着醉人的稻香，洋溢着劳动的喜悦，到处都是快乐歌唱；人们歌唱心底爱情，人们歌唱心底愿望；过去是破烂又寒酸，而今牛羊也有了新房。银铃响到果园边，果林里钻出群姑娘，红红脸儿花衣裳，比开屏的孔雀还漂亮；这姑娘捧着菠萝蜜，那姑娘捧着过山香〔注〕；“同志，歇歇脚吧，这社里的果子请你尝！”骑手欠身勒一勒马缰，霍霍地跑上山岗，溜烟里落下一句话：“谢谢你，我的姑娘！”姑娘中谁想起心里人，在遥远的遥远的边疆，那朵蜜蜜的笑，便轻轻啊缀在眉梢上。
        1956.7.28．广武车上。
  〔注〕过山香是一种香蕉。
