Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, Amman: A Jordanian government spokesman said on the 12th that Jordan is currently conducting high-level arrangements with Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia regarding the provision of financial assistance to it by the three countries.

The spokesman said that the current arrangement stipulates the dates for a Jordanian delegation to visit Damascus, Cairo and Riyadh. The delegation is going to those places in order to "reach an agreement on the details of this assistance."

Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia had promised to provide Jordan with financial assistance to replace the British annual subsidy of approximately 12 million pounds to Jordan after Jordan abolished the enslaving Jordanian-British treaty. The Jordanian government had already announced in November its decision to abolish the British-Jordanian treaty, and this policy has been approved by the Jordanian parliament.

Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, TASS, Damascus, December 13th: The Jordanian Minister of Justice told a Middle East News Agency reporter that Iraqi troops had completely withdrawn from Jordan.

Jordanian Defense Minister Abdul Halim Nimer said that the Jordanian government's decision to request the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Jordan was unrelated to the stationing of Syrian and Saudi Arabian troops in Jordan.

    约旦将接受埃叙沙三国援助
    约旦司法大臣说伊拉克军队已完全撤走
    新华社13日讯　安曼消息：约旦政府发言人12日说，约旦现在正就埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯向它提供财政援助的问题同三国进行高级安排。
    发言人说，目前的安排是规定约旦的一个代表团前往大马士革、开罗和利雅得去的日期。这个代表团到那些地方去是为了“就这种援助的细节取得一致的意见”。
    埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯三国曾答应在约旦废除奴役性的约旦—英国条约后，向约旦提供财政援助来代替英国每年给约旦的约一千二百万英镑的津贴。约旦政府已经在11月间宣布决定废除英国—约旦条约，这项政策已经由约旦议会通过。
    新华社13日讯　塔斯社大马士革13日讯：约旦司法大臣对中东通讯社记者说，伊拉克军队已经完全撤出约旦。
    约旦国防大臣阿卜杜勒·哈利姆·尼默尔说，约旦政府要求伊拉克军队撤出约旦的决议，同叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯在约旦的驻军问题无关。
