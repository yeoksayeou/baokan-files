Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 5th: Bucharest dispatch: To prepare for the National Assembly elections to be held on February 3rd next year, Romania has established the Central Council of the People's Democratic Front and the Central Election Committee.

　　The inaugural meeting of the Central Council of the People's Democratic Front was held in Bucharest on the 3rd. Participating in the meeting were advanced producers, scientists and writers, representatives of social organizations, and clergy.

　　Subsequently, the council members exchanged views on the work and tasks of the council.

　　Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej spoke on this issue, saying: Considering the significance of this National Assembly election in political and social life, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party hopes that all democratic and political forces in our country united in the People's Democratic Front will demonstrate our unity before the voters, demonstrate the growing spiritual and political unity of the working people of our country, the unbreakable alliance between the working class and the working peasants, and the friendship and brotherhood between the working people of all nationalities.
