Reaction to Criticism

    The information in the article "Lessons from the Excavation Incident of the Xichagou Ancient Tomb Group" published in your newspaper on November 30 is basically correct. Our bureau agrees with and accepts this criticism. We checked the errors in our work in May and made a self-criticism. In the report to the Central Committee on September 12, "Regarding the Damage and Clearance of the Xichagou Ancient Tombs in Xifeng County," we again reviewed this error and requested the higher authorities to impose punishment. However, we have not been able to publicly present this incident and our mistakes to provide lessons for relevant parties and the masses. Therefore, we believe this criticism is still necessary. We will continue to conduct in-depth investigations.　Liaoning Provincial Cultural Bureau

    对批评的反应
    11月30日你报发表的“西岔沟古墓群被掘事件的教训”一文中所谈情况，基本上是正确的。对于这一批评，我局表示同意和接受。我们曾在5月间检查了工作中的错误，做了检讨。在9月12日向中央报告“关于西丰县西岔沟古墓葬被破坏和清理的情况”中，又检讨了这一错误，并请求上级给予处分。但我们还未能把这一事件和我们的错误公开提出，给有关方面和群众做为教训。因此，我们认为这个批评还是有必要的。我们将继续深入检查。　辽宁省文化局
