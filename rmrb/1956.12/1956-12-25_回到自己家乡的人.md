    People Returning to Their Hometown
    By Our Correspondent Qin Da Muni
    Heading west from the new urban area of Baotou, you reach the Ula Mountains.
    The Ula Mountains stretch for about three hundred li, high and steep, with layers upon layers rising majestically. Near the mountains is a large plain bordering the mountains and overlooking the water, which is the Urat Front Banner in Ulanqab League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    Thirty or forty years ago, the Mongolian people of Urat Front Banner grazed their livestock along the Yellow River bank on this vast, lush plain. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders occupied the eastern part of the banner, and all the Mongolians were driven into the mountains. From that time on, the Mongolian people, having lost their rich pastures, lived a life of hardship in the barren mountains.
    After liberation, a small number of these people who had been forced into the mountains came down, and the government allocated them sufficient pastures. From 1950, people began to descend from the mountains in large numbers, and now, with the exception of a few, the vast majority have come down. A total of more than three thousand people in the banner have settled at the foot of the Ula Mountains.
    Now, when you go to the foot of the Ula Mountains, you can not only see the Mongolian people freely grazing their livestock on their former pastures, but you can also see how closely united they are with the Han farmers in building their beautiful life. Over 90% of the herdsmen here have joined cooperatives, and some have even jointly established ten joint Mongolian-Han nationality cooperatives with Han farmers. The Heshun Village Mongolian-Han Unity Cooperative, which I recently visited, is one of them. The cooperative is composed of fifty households, with nineteen Mongolian members.
    When I visited the home of Bayan, the Mongolian deputy director, several people were cleaning up the newly harvested wheat. When I greeted them in the Mongolian way, they stared at me blankly and did not speak. It turned out they were not Mongolians, but Han people; the Mongolians lived inside the house. At this moment, an old lady came out of the house and invited me in. The old lady, named Eshima, was in her sixties and was Bayan's mother-in-law. Her husband, Maxi, was in charge of livestock in the cooperative. The old lady told me, "We have few laborers in our family, so the Han members of our cooperative are helping us clean up the wheat outside." The old lady also said, "We rely on the Han members to help us with many heavy tasks."
    The old lady told many stories about the past: "When we were forced to go up the mountains, there was no place to live. Some lived in caves, and some lived in 'houses' barely built of stones. When night fell, we were so cold that we couldn't sleep, so we lit bonfires and spent those cold winter nights around them. Alas, those nights were so long!"
    However, even in those difficult years, the Mongolian and Han working people were still closely related. At that time, every autumn, the herdsmen would sneak down the mountain, and the Han farmers would harvest in front, while they followed behind picking up the ears of grain. The Mongolians learned that the Han farmers needed wood, so they secretly transported some wood to the foot of the mountain in the evening. The next evening, when the Han villagers came to transport the wood, they left some grain in the place where they had taken the wood. The Mongolian and Han people spent those years in this way. The friendship between the current two deputy directors of the cooperative, Bayan (Mongolian) and Zhang Jincai (Han), was formed at that time.
    After liberation, when the Mongolian people first came down from the mountains, just as when they first went up the mountains, the first difficulty they faced was the lack of housing. So the Han people helped them build houses. Bayan couldn't afford to build a house at all, but with Zhang Jincai's help, he built two houses.
    In the past few years, these Mongolian people, who have suffered so much, have worked hard with the Han people to build their beautiful and happy homes. This year, due to the autumn drought, the harvest of the Heshun Village Mongolian-Han Unity Cooperative was not very good. However, during this year, through various concrete facts, they have more deeply realized the benefits of the unity and mutual assistance between the Mongolian and Han people, and they have fully enjoyed these benefits. These benefits are not only beneficial to the Mongolian herdsmen, but also equally beneficial to the Han farmers.
    After the Mongolian and Han people jointly established the cooperative, they carried out internal division of labor. Except for a few Mongolian members who had grown crops before, most of the Mongolian members were engaged in grazing, and the livestock were managed in a unified manner. This division of labor not only solved the past agricultural and pastoral contradictions, but also brought many benefits to the members.
    Before the joint establishment of the cooperative, the Mongolian people had few livestock and could not make a living solely from livestock, so they had to grow some land. However, they had neither farming experience nor the necessary labor force, and they could not take care of both, so they could not do either well. In the past, Han farmers also had some scattered livestock, but because they focused their main energy on agriculture, the livestock never increased, and the survival rate of young livestock was less than 50%.
    This year, since the livestock have been managed in a unified manner by the cooperative, these situations have greatly changed.
    In the past, it was difficult to see felt on the kang (heated brick bed) in the homes of Han farmers, but if you go to the Heshun Village Unity Cooperative now, you can see them covered with white felt in any farmer's home. This is the new felt made this year by the cooperative from the wool produced by the Mongolian members. The wool of the Mongolian members not only solved the felt on the kang for the Han members, but also solved the summer clothing for the Han members this year. Sheep manure can also be used as fertilizer. More than two thousand carts of manure were applied this year after the joint establishment of the cooperative, which had never been done before.
    In the summer, the herdsmen moved their livestock to the mountains for grazing, and the vegetables and fruits produced by the farmers were continuously sent to the mountains, and the farmers could also eat all kinds of dairy products. Once, when Duan Qirong, a Han farmer, talked to me about these benefits, he said, "We Han people have never eaten butter before, we just watched others eat it, but this year we have all eaten it!" His tone was full of pride, and I think this pride is the precious fruit of the unity and mutual assistance between the Mongolian and Han people.

    回到自己家乡的人
    本报记者　钦达木尼
    从包头新市区西去，就是乌拉山。
    乌拉山长约三百里，高而又陡，层层叠叠，巍然峙立。山的附近是一个傍山望水的大平滩，这便是内蒙古自治区乌兰察布盟乌拉特前旗。
    在三、四十年前，乌拉特前旗的蒙古族人民就在这个广大的水草丰美的大平滩上，沿着黄河岸边游牧。抗日战争时期，日本侵略者侵占了旗的东部，他们全部被赶到山里去了。从那时起，失掉了丰美的牧场的蒙古族人，就在荒山里过着苦难的日子。
    解放后，这些被迫上山的人们，有少数从山上走下来，政府给他们辟出了足够的牧场。从1950年起山上的人开始大批下山，现在除少数人外，绝大部分人都下山了。全旗共有三千多人，下山后都沿着乌拉山麓安家了。
    现在，当你走到乌拉山下时，不但可以看到蒙古族人民在自己往日的牧场上自由地放牧，而且也可以看到他们和汉族农民怎样亲密团结建设他们美好的生活。这里的牧民有90％以上都合作化了，有一部分牧民还和汉族农民共同建立了十个蒙汉民族联合社。我最近访问的和顺庄蒙汉团结社就是其中之一。该社是由五十户组成，有十九户蒙古族社员。
    当我到蒙古族副主任巴荣家里访问时，有几个人正在收拾刚打下来的新麦子，我用蒙古人的礼节向他们问好时，他们呆呆地注视着我不说话，原来他们不是蒙古人，是汉人，屋里住的才是蒙古人。这时从屋里走出一个老太太把我请到屋里。老太太叫额喜玛，六十来岁，是巴荣的岳母。她的男人叫玛希，在合作社里放牲畜。老太太告诉我说：“我们家里劳动力少，外边是我们社里的汉族社员们帮助我们收拾麦子。”老太太还说：“我们许多重活都要靠汉族社员给我们帮忙哩。”
    老太太讲了很多过去的事情：“我们被迫上山的时候，山里连个住处都没有，有的住在山洞里，有的住在勉强用石头盖起的‘房子’里，到了晚间冻得不能睡觉，就升起了篝火，大家围绕着篝火度过那些寒冷的冬夜。唉，那些夜晚是多么长呀！”
    不过就是在这样一些困苦的年代里，蒙古族和汉族劳动人民之间却仍然是息息相关的。当时，牧民每到秋天就偷偷地跑下山来，汉族农民在前面进行收割，他们跟在后面拣穗子。蒙古族人了解到汉族农民需要木材，到了晚间偷偷地运了一点木材放到山脚下，第二天晚间汉族老乡来运木材时，在拿去木材的地方放上一点粮食。蒙古族和汉族人民就这样地度过了那个岁月。现在的两个社副主任巴荣（蒙古族）和张金才（汉族）的友谊就是在那个时候结下来的。
    解放后，蒙古族人刚下山来时，正像他们刚上山时一样，首先感到困难的是没有房子。于是汉族群众就帮助他们造房子。巴荣根本连房子也盖不起，由于张金才的帮助，也盖起了两间房子。
    几年来，这些饱受辛酸的蒙古族人民，和汉族人民一道，努力建设自己美满幸福的家园。今年由于秋旱，和顺庄蒙汉团结社的收成并不算太好。但是，在这一年里，通过各种具体事实，使他们更深刻地认识到了蒙古族和汉族人民团结互助的好处，他们充分享受到了这种好处。这种好处不仅是对蒙古族牧民有利，对汉族农民也同样有利。
    蒙古族和汉族人民联合办社以后，他们内部进行了分工，除个别种过庄稼的蒙古族社员外，一般的蒙古族社员都进行放牧，牲畜统一经管，这种分工不但解决了过去的农牧矛盾，而且也给社员们带来了许多好处。
    联合办社以前，蒙古族群众因牲畜少，光靠牲畜还不能过活，所以多少也必需种一点地。可是他们既没有种地经验，又缺乏必要的劳动人手，顾此失彼，结果哪一样也弄不好。汉族农民过去也有些散畜，但因为他们把主要的精力都放在农业上，因此牲畜总不见增长，幼畜的成活率不到50％。
    今年联合办社，牲畜由合作社统一经管以来，这些情况都有了很大改变。
    过去在汉族农民的家里，人们是很难看到炕上有毡子的，可是你现在到和顺庄团结社去看一下吧，无论你走到任何一家农民家里，都可以看到他们铺着洁白的毡子，这是合作社今年用蒙古族社员生产的羊毛新做的毡子。蒙古族社员的羊毛不仅给汉族社员解决了炕上铺的毡子，也解决了今年汉族社员的夏季服装。羊粪还可以做肥料，今年联合办社以后就施了二千多车粪，而施肥在这里过去是从来没有过的事情。
    夏季里，牧民们为了移场放牧，就把牲畜赶到山里去，农民生产的蔬菜瓜果源源不断地送到山里去，而农民呢，也可以吃到各种奶食品了。有一次，汉族农民段岐荣跟我谈到这些好处时，他说：“我们汉人过去从来没有吃过黄油，只是看着人家吃，可是今年我们也都吃到了！”语气里充满着一种自豪，我想这种自豪正是蒙古族和汉族人民团结互助的珍贵的果实。
