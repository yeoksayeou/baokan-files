    Grain Turned to Mud

    I often see grain that has been scattered on the ground in front of the grain department and on the docks by the river in Shashi City, Hubei Province. This scattered wheat, soybeans, and rice are left uncollected, trampled into mud by people and livestock. I hope the Shashi grain department will pay attention to this situation and stop wasting grain.

    粮食变成了泥末
    我经常在湖北省沙市市内粮食部门的门前和河边的码头上看见粮食储运部门丢撒在地上的粮食，这些撒在地上的小麦、大豆和米，竟无人收拣，而让人们和牲畜践踏成泥末。我希望沙市粮食部门注意这一情况，不要再糟踏粮食。
