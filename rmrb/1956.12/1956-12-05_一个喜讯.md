    A Piece of Good News
    The news of increased silkworm cocoon production in Zhejiang Province is encouraging.
    This is a great victory for the organized peasants in their fight against natural disasters. Zhejiang is one of the key silkworm cocoon producing areas in China. This summer, Zhejiang Province suffered a severe typhoon, which destroyed many mulberry trees and damaged many others. Many people were worried that this serious disaster would lead to a reduction in silkworm cocoon production throughout Zhejiang Province, and consequently, they were also concerned that this would cause serious difficulties in fulfilling the silk export tasks. As a result of the struggle against the disaster, Zhejiang's silkworm cocoon production not only did not decrease, but actually increased.
    This is also a victory for adhering to the correct style of leadership. In the first half of this year, some areas of Zhejiang Province, like some areas of other provinces, had a tendency to overemphasize grain production and neglect silkworm production and other sideline occupations. Some places even dug up mulberry trees to plant double-cropping rice. The Party and government leading organs at all levels in Zhejiang Province promptly corrected this subjective error, strengthened leadership over silkworm production, and vigorously promoted advanced sericulture experiences. Therefore, this year not only the total output of silkworm cocoons increased, but the unit yield also improved.
    With relatively correct leadership, the masses will demonstrate great creativity!

### 一个喜讯

    一个喜讯
    浙江省蚕茧增产的消息，是一个令人鼓舞的喜讯。
    这是组织起来的农民对自然灾害作斗争的巨大胜利。浙江是我国蚕茧的重点产区之一。今年夏天，浙江省遭受了特大台风的袭击，许多桑树被摧毁了，许多桑树被伤损了。许多人都曾经忧虑这场严重的灾害会使浙江全省蚕茧减产，因而也担心这会给丝织品出口任务的完成带来严重困难。对灾害进行斗争的结果，浙江蚕茧不但没有减产，而且增产了。
    这也是坚持正确的领导作风的胜利。今年上半年，浙江省有些地区同别的省的某些区一样，发生了过分偏重粮食生产、忽视桑蚕生产和其他副业的偏向，有些地方曾经挖掉桑树改种双季稻。浙江各级党政领导机关及时纠正了这种主观主义的错误，加强了对桑蚕生产的领导，大力推广了先进的养蚕经验。因此，今年不但蚕茧总产量增加了，单位产量也提高了。
    有了比较正确的领导，群众就会表现出巨大的创造力！
