Another Large Valley Reservoir on the Huai River

    The Mozi Tan Reservoir is under full-scale construction. This reservoir is being built on the eastern source of the Pi River in Huoshan County, Anhui Province, and is the third reservoir to be built on the Pi River after the Foziling and Xianghongdian Reservoirs. After the reservoir is completed, it will form a strong flood control line with the above two reservoirs and the Lianghekou Reservoir to be built, and will completely control the flood of the Pi River and reduce the flood control burden of the main stream of the Huai River. This reservoir can store more than 280 million cubic meters of floodwater and generate more than 15,000 kilowatts of electricity.

    淮河上又一座大型山谷水库
    磨子潭水库正在全面施工，这座水库修在安徽省霍山县的?河东源，是续佛子岭、响洪甸两水库之后在?河上兴建的第三座水库。水库建成后，将和上述两水库跟将要兴建的两河口水库，组成一个强大的防洪线，全部控制?河的洪水，减轻淮河干流的防洪负担。这座水库能拦蓄洪水二亿八千多万立方公尺，发电一万五千多瓩。
