Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, December 24th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru concluded his two-day visit to Canada and flew to London on the afternoon of the 23rd, where he will meet with British Prime Minister Eden.

Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, December 24th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said on the 23rd that the situation in Algeria is "worse than the situation in Hungary." He said he had been waiting for France to "make some indication" in Algeria.

In a television interview broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Nehru also said that the most important step towards improving the situation in the Middle East should first be clearing the Suez Canal, and second, deciding the future of the canal.

He also believed that the "differences are not very great" between the United States and the Soviet Union on the issue of disarmament. Steps should now be taken in the right direction. These steps include the abolition of all military treaties and alliances, and the withdrawal of troops from foreign bases.

Nehru advocated an understanding between the two major powers of China and the United States and hoped that this understanding would grow.
