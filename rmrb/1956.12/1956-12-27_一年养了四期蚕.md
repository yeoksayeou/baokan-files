    Four Seasons of Silkworm Raising in a Year
    (Our dispatch) The Qingfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative of Zhaohe Township, Hang County, Zhejiang Province, in addition to raising spring silkworms, summer silkworms, and autumn silkworms this year, also tried raising late autumn silkworms by utilizing the tender shoots of mulberry leaves that grow in late autumn, achieving a comprehensive bumper harvest in all four seasons. The leading organs of Zhejiang Province are preparing to exhibit the cooperative's achievements at the upcoming provincial agricultural exhibition.
    This year, the cooperative raised a total of 213 silkworm egg sheets across the spring, summer, autumn, and late autumn seasons, producing 11,674.25 kilograms of cocoons. The average yield per silkworm egg sheet was over 27.25 kilograms, and the quality was particularly good, generally first and second grade cocoons. This year, the income from cocoons increased by 61.53% compared to last year, with the average income from cocoons alone increasing by nearly 30 yuan per member household compared to last year. The members said, "After cooperativization, mulberry trees have also become money trees." (Chen Daliang)

    一年养了四期蚕
    本报讯　浙江省杭县肇和乡庆丰农业生产合作社，今年除了饲养春蚕、夏蚕和秋蚕外，还利用深秋长出的桑叶嫩梢，试养了晚秋蚕，四季蚕都获得全面丰收。浙江省领导机关准备把这个社的丰收成绩在即将开幕的全省农业展览会上展出。
    今年这个社春夏秋晚秋四期蚕共养了普通蚕种二百一十三张，生产蚕茧一万一千六百七十四斤四两，平均每张蚕种产量是五十四斤十二两多，品质也特别好，一般的都是一、二级茧。今年蚕茧收入比去年增加61.53％，平均每户社员，仅蚕茧收入一项就比去年增加将近三十元。社员们说：“合作化后桑树也变成摇钱树了。”（陈大良）
