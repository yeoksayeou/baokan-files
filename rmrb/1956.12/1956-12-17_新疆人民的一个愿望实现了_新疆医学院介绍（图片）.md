　　For many years, people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have hoped for a school to cultivate advanced medical personnel from local ethnic groups. Now, this wish has been realized. This is the birth of Xinjiang Medical College.
　　Xinjiang Medical College is built at the foot of the scenic Liyu (Carp) Mountain in Urumqi, surrounded by clear streams and lush young forests, with fresh air and a beautiful and tranquil environment. This medical college is built according to modern standards, with complete equipment and a magnificent scale. The college has teaching buildings for morphology, physiology, biology, etc., as well as wards for infectious diseases, isolation, skin and venereal diseases, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and a nursing school. In order to cultivate medical personnel as soon as possible, the medical college adopts the principle of building and teaching simultaneously. This autumn, it has already enrolled 233 students from Uyghur, Kazakh, Tatar, Hui, Sibe, and Han ethnic groups. After the medical college is fully completed, it will have three departments: medicine, pediatrics, and public health, with a capacity of 3,000 students.
　　Each teaching building has a stepped classroom that can accommodate more than 100 students, a laboratory for 10 to 15 people to conduct experiments, an experimental preparation room, and a research room specifically for teachers. This is a scene of the new students attending classes in a bright classroom.

    许多年来，新疆各族人民就希望有一个培养本地各民族高级卫生建设人才的学校。现在，这个愿望已经实现了。这就是新疆医学院的诞生。
    新疆医学院建筑在乌鲁木齐市风景秀丽的鲤鱼山下，四周是清彻的溪水和葱翠的幼林，空气清新，环境幽美恬静。这所医学院是按照现代化标准建筑起来的，设备完善，规模宏伟。全院有形态、生理、生物等教学大楼和传染、隔离、皮肤性病、妇产、小儿科等病房以及护士学校。为了尽早培养出医务人员，这个医学院采取边建设、边教学的方针，今年秋季，已招收了二百三十三名维吾尔、哈萨克、塔塔尔、回、锡伯和汉族的学生。医学院在全部建成之后，将有医疗、儿科、公共卫生等三个学系，能容纳三千名学生。
    每座教学大楼都有可以容纳一百多人听课的梯形教室，供十人到十五人做实验的实验窒、实验准备室和专供教师用的研究室。这是新同学们在光线明亮的教室里听课的情形。
    生物讲师正在讲解动物系统树，帮助同学们了解动物界的演变情况。
    今年尚未开课的教研室正积极地进行教学准备工作。图为组织胚胎教研室的工作人员在制作教学用的组织切片。

    少数民族同学正在努力学习汉文，以便更好地掌握专业知识。这是汉族学生张玉林（左）在帮助维吾尔族同学阿不力孜学习汉语的情形。
    在山脚下听到随风荡漾的手风琴声，这正是同学们在一个假日里游玩的途中。
    象棋是少数民族同学非常喜爱的一种游戏。课后，他们又凑在一起了。
    医学院现已完成了四万五千多平方公尺的建筑，此外还有五万八千多平方公尺的建筑将在明年完成。这是正在边建设、边教学的新疆医学院外景。

    为了使病人有更好的休养环境，一般的病房只有三张床位。现在一部分病房已准备完毕，就要开始接收病人了。
    医学院正在有计划地培养少数民族教师。图为物理教研室讲师李书田（中）在帮助实习助教祖赫拉（右，塔塔尔族）和阿不勒海提（左，维吾尔族）进行学习。
    医学院附设有一座拥有六百张病床和现代化设备的医院，为同学们创造良好的实习条件。现在医院的一部分设备和病房已经准备就绪。图为手术室。
    图书馆已经搜集到很多少数民族文字的书籍，以便为同学们提供良好的学习条件。这是图书馆管理员阿不都克里木（维吾尔族）正在整理新到的图书。
