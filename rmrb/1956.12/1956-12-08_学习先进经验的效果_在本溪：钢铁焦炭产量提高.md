　　·The Effect of Learning from Advanced Experience·
　　In Benxi: Steel and Coke Production Increases
    Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, December 7th. Learning from the strengths of other enterprises has been an important activity for the Benxi Iron and Steel Company this year. In the past eleven months, the company has sent more than 1,000 people to Anshan, Fushun, Daye, Beijing, and other places to learn advanced experience in various aspects.
    The Benxi Iron Smelting Plant learned from the "rapid combustion" and "rapid tuyere changing" experience of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant, and the average daily output increased by 6% compared with the plan. The Benxi Refractory Materials Plant did not complete its plan in the first quarter of this year. After the workers applied the advanced experience of the Anshan Refractory Materials Plant, they fully completed the plan for the third quarter. The Benxi Coking Plant also increased its coke production by learning from the experience of Taiyuan and Beijing factories.
    The Benxi Steel Plant has also signed a long-term comprehensive cooperation contract with the Fushun Steel Plant to support each other with manpower and materials, and to learn advanced experience from each other by means of "teaching and learning." Now, both factories have made progress in steelmaking, rolling, forging, and heat treatment technologies.

　　·学习先进经验的效果·
　　在本溪：钢铁焦炭产量提高
    新华社本溪7日电　学习其他企业的长处，是本溪钢铁公司今年的一项重要活动。在过去十一个月里，这个公司曾经先后派出一千多人到鞍山、抚顺、大冶、北京等地学习各方面的先进经验。
    本溪炼铁厂学习了鞍钢炼铁厂“快速燃烧”和“快速换风口”的经验，平均日产量比计划提高了6％。本溪耐火材料厂今年第一季度没有完成计划，职工们运用了鞍钢耐火材料厂的先进经验以后，全面完成了第三季度的计划。本溪焦化厂也因为学习太原、北京工厂的经验，提高了焦炭的产量。
    本溪钢厂还同抚顺钢厂签订长期全面合作的合同，以人力、物力互相支援，并且用包教包学的方法互相学习先进经验。现在在炼钢、轧钢、锻钢、热处理的技术上，两厂都取得了进步。
