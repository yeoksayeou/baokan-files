    Polish "People's Tribune" Publishes Article
    Calling for Intensified Struggle Against Enemies of Socialism
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch From Warsaw — The Polish United Workers' Party's organ, "People's Tribune," recently published an article in its "Problem Discussion Column" by Wacławik, titled "The Front for the Struggle for Democratization."

    The article emphasized that recently in Poland it can be seen that anti-people and anti-socialist forces are stepping up their activities, trying to use economic difficulties and mistakes of the past period to attack the people's regime and the Polish United Workers' Party. Among those forces that once participated in the October events under the banner of independence and democratization, there are also some right-leaning forces who, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, are now putting forward anti-socialist slogans.

    The struggle against the enemies of socialism in ideology and theory is of great significance. Bourgeois political parties are trying hard to seize ideological positions. We must not allow hostile forces to take the initiative and push the Party to the right.

    The article wrote that blurring ideological and political differences, lacking debate with reactionary or erroneous views, and insufficient emphasis on the ideological independence and characteristics of the working class as the most thorough force for democracy and socialist society may weaken the socialist nature of democratization, allow hostile forces to take the initiative, and increasingly push the Party to the right, as happened in the Nagy government in Hungary.

    The article emphasized that it can be seen from this that the struggle against the enemies of socialism in ideology and theory is still very weak. This issue is of great significance. That is to say, ideological struggle must be used to make up for the shortcomings of the political struggle of the Party's progressive forces. The situation analyzed by Lenin in similar circumstances illustrates the great necessity of determining the Party's ideological position, but we have forgotten this necessity. I think the phenomenon of neglecting theoretical issues in the Party, in newspapers and publishing houses, and among the Party's ideological leaders is very significant.

    The author then asked: Are there phenomena of right-wing activities? Yes, there are. This is manifested in the rampant spread of bourgeois, nationalist, anti-Soviet, anti-Semitic, and anti-Ukrainian ideas, and in some places even attempts to undermine the unity of the workers' movement. Right-leaning kulakism is reviving in the countryside. The common slogan of these forces is "transition to the next stage, that is, the transition to the stage of bourgeois democracy."

    Many figures from the old bourgeois political parties are trying hard to seize the largest positions in people's committees, social organizations, and political organizations in the tide of democratization. Finally, some of the most reactionary and rampant elements turned to adventurism.

    The article pointed out that the reactionaries vainly attempt to equate "Stalinism" with socialism and declare "the bankruptcy of socialism," and the struggle waged by the press against this danger, taking "People's Tribune" as an example, is also far from sufficient, not to mention some weeklies or "New Road" (the theoretical and political publication of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party). The weekly "Frankly Speaking" (a weekly for university students and young intellectuals) did not take into account that the Eighth Plenary Session changed the balance of power and the political situation in the country, and generally did not react to these statements. Whether in the weekly "Frankly Speaking" or in many other magazines and newspapers, one can see the neglect of the Marxist principle of analyzing events and social theories from a class point of view. For example, many newspapers completely failed to emphasize the class nature of the Bydgoszcz or Szczecin events.

    Letting the reactionaries speak will threaten the process of democratization. It is not allowed for right-leaning elements to hand over the helm of the struggle for democratization to the reactionaries.

    The article said that the reason this situation has arisen is that a considerable portion of the Party's intellectuals have abandoned the Marxist viewpoint on this issue. Freedom of criticism from a Marxist standpoint within the Party does not mean being independent of any unified and well-considered theory, independent of any basic principles, but means replacing superficial theories with another more correct theory while maintaining the unique basic principles of socialist thought.

    The article pointed out that letting the reactionaries speak will hinder or directly threaten the process of democratization. Since right-leaning elements have never given up their own goals, this position, under the influence of the environment, will lead to the result of handing over the spiritual helm of the struggle for democratization to the reactionaries. Some people want to directly attribute democratization only to the "struggle against Stalinists," and they believe that Stalinists must be found and discarded. This is complete programmatic and political weakness, which will only benefit reactionary forces.

    The article criticized the argument of the weekly "Frankly Speaking" that "Stalinism is everywhere." The article said that this argument was later embodied in a vulgar saying: that the "struggle against institutions" put forward by a considerable portion of young people was regarded as a slogan for struggling against all state institutions and Party institutions, against social organizations, and even against production administrative institutions. The article in the weekly "Frankly Speaking" did not mention the task of struggling against reactionary forces at all, and this article replaced class struggle with a vague "generational struggle."

    The article further pointed out that the consequences that theoretical eclecticism and forgetting the most basic Marxist foundations have already led to and may lead to, "should first be the responsibility of such Party member intellectuals, who, under the pretext of an alliance of anti-Stalinist forces and the real unity of the people, have abandoned ideological struggle on several major issues, abandoned emphasizing the independent socialist position of the working class and its political party, and abandoned resolutely resisting attacks by the reactionaries."

    The author concluded by writing that these things happened precisely when our various "allies" were emphasizing their ideological independence from their own class standpoint, that is, the bourgeois standpoint. We must never give up the struggle against the enemies of socialism.

### 波兰“人民论坛报”发表文章  号召对社会主义的敌人加强斗争

    波兰“人民论坛报”发表文章
    号召对社会主义的敌人加强斗争
    新华社讯　波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛报”最近在它的“问题讨论栏”中发表了瓦茨拉维克的一篇文章，题目是“为民主化而斗争的阵线”。
    文章强调指出，最近在波兰可以看出反人民、反社会主义的力量正在加紧活动，它们想利用经济困难和过去一个时期的错误来攻击人民政权，攻击波兰统一工人党。在那些曾经在独立和民主化的口号下参加十月事件的力量当中，还有这样一些右倾势力，他们在波兰统一工人党八中全会以后的今天提出反社会主义的口号。
    同社会主义的敌人在思想理论方面的斗争具有巨大意义。资产阶级政党极力想夺取思想阵地。决不能让敌对力量掌握主动，把党推向右倾。
    文章写道，抹煞思想上和政治上的差别、缺乏同反动观点或错误观点进行辩论、对作为最彻底的民主和社会主义社会力量的工人阶级的思想独立性和特点强调不够等，这些情况可能会削弱民主化的社会主义性质，让敌对力量掌握主动，并且把党日益推向右倾，像在匈牙利纳吉政府中所发生过的一样。
    文章着重说，由此可以看出同社会主义的敌人在思想理论方面进行的斗争还很薄弱。这个问题具有巨大的意义。这就是说，要用思想斗争来弥补党的进步力量的政治斗争的不足。列宁在类似情况下所分析的形势说明了确定党的思想阵地的极大的必要性，而我们却遗忘了这种必要性。我认为党内、报馆和出版社以及党的思想领导积极分子中间不重视理论问题的现象是很显著的。
    作者接着问道：我们有没有右倾分子活动的现象呢？有的。这表现在资产阶级、民族主义、反苏、反犹太、反乌克兰思想的泛滥，而在某些地方甚至企图破坏工人运动的团结。右倾的富农主义在农村复活。这些势力的共同口号是“过渡到下一个阶段，即过渡到资产阶级民主的阶段”。
    旧的资产阶级政党的许多人物在民主化的潮流中极力想在人民委员会、社会团体和政治组织中夺取最大的阵地。最后，某些最反动和最猖獗的分子转向了冒险。
    文章指出，反动派妄想把“斯大林主义”同社会主义混为一谈，宣告“社会主义破产”，而报刊同这一危险所作的斗争，即以“人民论坛报”来说，也是十分不够的，至于一些周刊或“新路”（波兰统一工人党中央的理论和政治刊物），就更不用说了。“直言”周刊（大学生和青年知识分子的周刊）没有考虑到八中全会改变了国内的力量对比和政治形势，对这些声明一般并没有反应。无论在“直言”周刊或其他许多杂志、报纸上，都可以看到忽视对事件和社会理论用阶级观点加以分析的马克思主义原则。例如，许多报纸完全没有着重指出比得哥煦或者什切青事件的阶级性质。
    让反动派讲话，将会使民主化的进程受到威胁。不容许右倾分子把争取民主化斗争的舵交给反动派。
    文章说，这种情况之所以产生，是因为相当大的一部分党的知识分子在这个问题上放弃了马克思主义的观点。在党内从马克思主义立场出发进行批评的自由，并不是说不依赖于任何统一的深思熟虑的理论、不依赖于什么基本原则，而是意味着：在保持社会主义思想的独特的基本原则下、用另一种更正确的理论来代替肤浅的理论性的自由。
    文章指出，让反动派讲话，将会使民主化的进程受到阻碍或者受到直接的威胁。既然右倾分子一直没有放弃他们自己的目的，这种立场随着环境的影响就会导致把争取民主化斗争的精神上的舵交给反动派的结果。某些人想把民主化仅仅直接归结为“同斯大林分子进行斗争”，他们认为，必须找出和抛开斯大林分子。这是纲领上和政治上的完全软弱无力，只会对反动势力有利。
    文章抨击了“直言”周刊所谓“斯大林主义到处皆是”的论点。文章说，这个论点后来体现在一种庸俗的说法上：就是把相当大的一部分青年所提出的“同机关进行斗争”当作同一切国家机关和党的机关、同社会团体、甚至同生产行政机构进行斗争的口号了。“直言”周刊的文章根本没有提到同反动势力进行斗争的任务，这篇文章用模糊不清的“世代斗争”代替阶级斗争。
    文章进一步指出，理论上的折衷主义和遗忘了起码的马克思主义基础所已经导致的和可能导致的后果，“首先应当由这样一些党员知识分子负责，他们以反斯大林势力的联盟和人民的真正团结为借口，在几个主要问题上放弃进行思想斗争，放弃强调工人阶级和它的政党的独立的社会主义立场，放弃对反动派的攻击实行坚决抵抗”。
    作者最后写道，这些事恰恰发生在我们的各种“同盟者”都从自己的阶级立场、即资产阶级立场出发强调自己思想上的独立性的时候。我们任何时候都不能放弃对社会主义的敌人进行斗争。
