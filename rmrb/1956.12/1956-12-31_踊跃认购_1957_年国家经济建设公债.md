    Enthusiastically Subscribe to the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds
    The state issuing economic construction bonds is a regular method of accumulating funds for socialist construction. People purchasing bonds is a patriotic act of supporting socialist construction, and also a way of saving and storing. Since the state began issuing economic construction bonds in 1954, the plans have been overfulfilled every year, fully demonstrating the Chinese people's high enthusiasm and initiative in building socialism. 1957 is the final year of China's first Five-Year Plan and also a year of decisive significance. In order to enrich the state's economic construction funds and ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, we should enthusiastically subscribe to the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds.
    The total amount of the 1957 National Economic Construction Bonds is still 600 million yuan, the same as in previous years. However, due to the great victory of agricultural cooperativization and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce nationwide, new changes have taken place in domestic class relations. Therefore, corresponding adjustments have been made to the amount of bonds allocated to various classes for subscription in 1957: the amount allocated to workers and staff has increased, the amount allocated to farmers has increased slightly, the amount allocated to industry and commerce has decreased significantly, and the amount allocated to the military and urban residents has remained basically unchanged.
    In the past few years, the amount of bonds purchased by workers and staff has always exceeded the amount planned for sale by the state. This fully demonstrates the Chinese working class's high enthusiasm and initiative in supporting national economic construction. In 1957, the state plans to sell 280 million yuan of bonds to workers and staff nationwide, an increase of 50 million yuan compared to the planned sales figure for 1956, but only an increase of just over 11 million yuan compared to the actual purchase figure for workers and staff in 1956. Is this amount achievable? We believe it is achievable. In the second half of 1956, workers' wages increased by an average of about 13% compared to the first half of the year. The 50 million yuan of bonds that the state plans to sell more to workers and staff in 1957 is only equivalent to a fraction of the increased wages. In 1957, workers and staff nationwide can receive 75 million yuan in principal and interest from bonds issued in the past three years, a portion of which can be used to purchase bonds issued in 1957. In order to promote the further development of national economic construction, workers and staff nationwide will certainly be willing to buy more bonds.
    The state plans to issue 200 million yuan of bonds to farmers nationwide in 1957, an increase of 10 million yuan compared to the planned sales figure for 1956. In 1956, some regions suffered severe natural disasters, but on a nationwide scale, the harvest of agricultural products still exceeded that of 1955; the large-scale sideline production carried out in various places in the winter of 1956 will also increase farmers' cash income. Completing the task of selling bonds to farmers is also entirely possible.
    The bonds sold in rural areas, excluding poor farmers and some disaster victims in disaster-stricken areas who are unable to purchase them, require each farmer to subscribe to an average of just over five jiao, a very small amount. In order to reduce the burden of rural work and ensure the completion of the bond sales plan, the bonds issued in rural areas in 1957 will be sold to farmers in conjunction with the collection of agricultural taxes. This method is simple and easy to implement, saving time and manpower, but propaganda and mobilization should be carried out well, adhering to the principle of voluntariness and preventing the phenomenon of mandatory allocation.
    The state plans to sell 75 million yuan of bonds to industry and commerce in 1957, a decrease of nearly one-half compared to the planned sales figure for 1956. This is a figure decided by the state based on the new situation after the completion of the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. Now, industrialists and businessmen no longer obtain "four-horse division" profits from enterprises, but instead obtain a fixed amount of interest from the state. Therefore, the bonds sold among them should naturally be reduced. In 1957, the state will pay industrialists and businessmen more than 110 million yuan in fixed interest. The number of capitalists and their staff members has reached 370,000, and their average wages are higher than those of general workers and staff. There are also approximately three million small merchants and peddlers nationwide, who also have the ability to purchase a portion of the bonds. This shows that it is not difficult for people in industry and commerce to complete the bond sales figure planned by the state, and they should fully exert their strength and strive to overfulfill the task.
    The enthusiasm of military personnel for purchasing bonds is very high, and they overfulfill the sales figure planned by the state every year. Since military personnel donated agricultural machinery worth approximately 40 million yuan to agricultural cooperatives and the state's land reclamation efforts in 1956, the state did not increase the amount of bonds sold to them in 1957. The general public and people of other components also overfulfilled the bonds sales planned by the state in 1956. In order not to increase the burden on this part of the people, the state did not increase the bonds planned to be sold to them in 1957. It seems that there will be no problems in selling the 1957 economic construction bonds among these groups of people.
    However, it would be absolutely wrong to relax leadership over the work of selling bonds if only the favorable conditions of the work are seen. In 1956, some areas of Heilongjiang and Jilin suffered fairly serious natural disasters, but because the leading organs grasped the work very tightly and did a lot of work, the work of selling bonds was successfully completed. Although Liaoning had a bumper harvest throughout the province, it failed to complete the task of selling bonds for the opposite reason. This proves the important role of leadership.
    The so-called strengthening of leadership is first and foremost to strengthen propaganda and education work, repeatedly explaining to the masses why the state issues bonds, why it issues bonds every year, and what benefits the issuance of bonds has for the country and for themselves, in order to raise the political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm of the masses. Under this premise, determining a reasonable distribution ratio and adopting some working methods that facilitate the masses, especially adhering to the principle of voluntary subscription by the masses, then the task of selling bonds will definitely be completed.

### 踊跃认购1957年国家经济建设公债

    踊跃认购1957年国家经济建设公债
    国家发行经济建设公债，是积累社会主义建设资金的一个经常的方法。人民购买公债，是支援社会主义建设的爱国行为，也是节约储蓄的一种方式。自从1954年国家开始发行经济建设公债以来，年年超额完成计划，充分表现了我国人民建设社会主义的高度热情和积极性。1957年是我国第一个五年计划最后的一年，也是具有决定意义的一年。为了充实国家经济建设的资金，保证提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的任务，我们应该踊跃认购1957年国家经济建设公债。
    1957年国家经济建设公债总额仍为六亿元，和前几年一样。但是，由于全国范围的农业合作化和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的巨大胜利，国内阶级关系有了新的变化，因此，1957年分配给各阶层认购的公债数额，作了相应的调整：分配给职工的增加了，分配给农民的增加了一点点，分配给工商界的减少了许多，分配给部队和市民的基本未变。
    几年来，职工群众购买公债的数额，总是超过了国家计划推销的数额。这充分地表现了我国工人阶级支援国家经济建设的高度热情和积极性。1957年国家计划在全国职工中推销公债二亿八千万元，比1956年计划推销数字增加了五千万元，比1956年职工实际购买数字只增加了一千一百多万元。这个数额是不是可以完成呢？我们认为是可以完成的。1956年下半年，职工工资比上半年平均增加了13％左右，1957年计划向职工多推销的五千万元公债，仅仅相当于增加的工资的几十分之一。1957年全国职工可以从过去三年公债本息中，收入七千五百万元，其中有一部分可以用来购买1957年发行的公债。为了推动国家经济建设进一步的发展，全国职工当然愿意多买一些公债。
    1957年计划在全国农民中发行的公债是二亿元，比1956年计划推销数字增加了一千万元。1956年部分地区遭受了严重的自然灾害，但就全国范围来说，农产品的收获量还超过了1955年；各地在1956年冬季开展的大规模副业生产，也会使农民增加一部分现金收入。在农民中完成推销公债的任务，也是完全可能的。
    在农村中推销的公债，除去贫苦农户和遭灾地区的部分灾民无力购买以外，每个农民平均认购五角多钱就够了，数字是很小的。为了减轻农村工作的担负和保证公债推销计划的完成，1957年在农村发行的公债，将要实行结合农业税征收工作向农民推销的方法。这种方法简便易行，节省时间、人力，但是应该很好地进行宣传动员，坚持自愿原则，防止硬性摊派的现象。
    1957年准备向工商界推销的公债是七千五百万元，比1956年计划推销数减少了将近二分之一。这是国家根据私营工商业社会主义改造完成以后的新情况决定的数字。现在工商业者已经不再从企业中获得“四马分肥”的利润，而是从国家获得一定数量的定息。因此，在他们中间推销的公债，当然应该减少。1957年国家将要付给工商业者一亿一千多万元的定息。资方人员从业者已经达到三十七万人，他们的平均工资比一般职工为高。全国还有大约三百万小商小贩，也有力量购买一部分公债。这就说明工商界人士完成国家计划推销的公债数字是不困难的，他们应该充分发挥自己的力量，争取超额完成任务。
    部队人员购买公债的积极性很高，每年都超额完成国家计划推销的数字。由于部队人员在1956年为农业合作社和国家的垦荒事业捐献了价值大约四千万元的农业机械，国家没有在1957年给他们增加推销公债的数额。一般市民及其他成份的人民在1956年也超额完成了国家计划推销的公债。为了不增加这部分人民的负担，1957年计划向他们推销的公债也没有增加。在这几部分人当中推销1957年经济建设公债，看来不会有什么问题。
    但是，如果只看见工作的有利条件，对推销公债的工作放松领导，也是决不应该的。1956年，黑龙江和吉林部分地区遭受了相当严重的自然灾害，但是由于领导机关抓的很紧，作了许多工作，推销公债的工作顺利完成了。辽宁虽然全省丰收，但由于相反的原因，却没有完成推销公债的任务。这就证明领导的重要作用。
    所谓加强领导，首先是加强宣传教育工作，反复向群众说明国家为什么要发行公债？为什么年年发行公债？发行公债对国家对自己究竟有哪些好处？以便提高群众的政治觉悟和爱国热情。在这个前提下，再确定合理的分配比例，采取一些便利群众的工作方法，特别是要按照群众自愿认购的原则，那末，推销公债的任务就一定能够完成。
