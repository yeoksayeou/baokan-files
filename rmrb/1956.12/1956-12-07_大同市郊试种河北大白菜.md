　  Trial Cultivation of Hebei Cabbage in the Suburbs of Datong City

    (Our dispatch) This year, the Datong City State-owned Second Vegetable Gardening Farm and the Zhao Jia Xiao Cun and Xi Shui Mo agricultural cooperatives have achieved good growth in their 60 mu trial cultivation of Hebei cabbage. The highest yield reached 11,000 jin per mu, exceeding the general unit area yield of Yuan cabbage, which has a relatively large output locally, by 4,000 jin.

    In the past, Datong City produced very few varieties of vegetables. Transporting vegetables from far away not only increased vegetable prices but also wasted a lot of transportation capacity. The Datong City agricultural department plans to expand the sowing area of cabbage to 1,000 mu in 1957, striving to ensure that the local demand for cabbage is basically supplied locally in the future.

　  大同市郊试种河北大白菜
    本报讯　大同市国营第二蔬菜园艺场和赵家小村、西水磨两个农业社今年试种的六十亩河北大白菜生长得很好，最高产量每亩达到一万一千斤，高出当地产量较大的元白菜的一般单位面积产量四千斤。
    大同市过去生产的蔬菜品种很少，远道运菜，不仅提高了菜价，而且浪费了很多的运输力。大同市农业部门计划1957年要把大白菜的播种面积扩大到一千亩，争取今后当地所需要的大白菜，基本上由当地供应。　　（许汉儒、鞠鸿运）
