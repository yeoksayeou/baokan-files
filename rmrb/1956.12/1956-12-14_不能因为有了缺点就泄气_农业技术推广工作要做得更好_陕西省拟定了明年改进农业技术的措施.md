Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 13th: While opposing subjectivism in agricultural technology extension work, it is also necessary to overcome the emotions of being timid and afraid to take responsibility that arise from criticizing subjectivism. This was an important topic at the agricultural technology extension work conference held in Shaanxi Province from November 26th to December 6th.

Participants in the meeting believed that, while the agricultural cooperative movement has moved forward in Shaanxi Province in recent years, great achievements have been made in promoting agricultural technology. This year, 70% to 80% of wheat, cotton, and rice have been densely planted, and the area of improved varieties of these three crops and corn has expanded by 15% to 30% compared to last year. Other aspects such as intercropping, fertilization, and plant protection have also improved compared to the past. As a result, the total output of grain and cotton in the province this year increased by 12% to 68% compared to last year. However, this spring, the provincial leading organs and some regions had impatient emotions in the work of promoting agricultural technology. This was manifested in the fact that when promoting the two excellent varieties of Yin Fang Japonica Rice and Golden Queen Corn, some areas did not choose the appropriate soil and the cultivation techniques did not keep up, resulting in reduced production. In some areas, in terms of fertilization, they simply emphasized quantity and ignored fertilization techniques, causing wheat lodging and cotton excessive growth, and the relevant provincial departments set the time for early cotton sowing too rigidly. The meeting analyzed and studied these issues and took them as lessons.

The meeting also criticized the ideas of timidity and fear of taking responsibility that some cadres of agricultural technology extension stations had developed after opposing subjectivism in agricultural technology extension work. The meeting believed that the achievements in the past were the main thing, and one must never be discouraged or complain to each other because of shortcomings and mistakes. The important thing is to learn from the lessons and improve the work. The meeting emphasized that in the future, in the work of promoting agricultural technology, the higher authorities should still put forward plans and requirements, but this must be cleverly combined with the promotion work of grassroots units that is appropriate to local conditions and timely.

The meeting also made some provisions on the agricultural technology measures for the province next year. In terms of promoting improved varieties, it is necessary to strictly implement the working methods of full regional trials and multi-point demonstrations, and do a good job of investigating and studying the soil fertility, water conservancy conditions, etc. of the areas to be promoted. Regarding fertilizer work, we should actively start from promoting green manure, improving compost technology, and promoting superphosphate according to conditions, and effectively improve fertilizer accumulation technology and fertilization methods. For the promotion of new agricultural tools, plant protection work, rational close planting, and increasing the area of intercropping, we should gradually improve on the basis of investigation and research, actively and steadily.

### 不能因为有了缺点就泄气  农业技术推广工作要做得更好  陕西省拟定了明年改进农业技术的措施

    不能因为有了缺点就泄气
    农业技术推广工作要做得更好
    陕西省拟定了明年改进农业技术的措施
    新华社西安13日电　在反对农业技术推广工作中的主观主义的同时，还必须克服由于批判主观主义而产生的畏首畏尾、不敢负责的情绪。这是陕西省在11月26日到12月6日举行的农业技术推广工作会议上的重要议题。
    参加会议的人认为：陕西省几年来在农业合作化运动向前发展的同时，在推广农业技术方面获得了很大成绩。今年有70％到80％的小麦、棉花和水稻已经密植，这三种作物和玉米的良种面积比去年扩大了15％到30％。其他像复种、施肥、植物保护等方面也都比过去有了进步。因此，今年全省粮食和棉花总产量比去年提高12％到68％。但是，今春在农业技术推广工作上，省领导机关和部分地区是有急躁情绪的。这表现在推广银坊粳稻和金皇后玉米两个优良品种时，部分地区选择土壤不当，又加栽培技术没有赶上，因而形成减产；有些地区，在施肥方面单纯强调数量、忽视施肥技术，引起小麦倒伏和棉花徒长，以及省有关部门对棉花提早播种的时间规定得过死过严等。会议对这些问题都做了分析和研究，并且引为教训。
    会议还批判了在反对农业技术推广工作上的主观主义思想以后，部分农业技术推广站干部又产生的畏首畏尾、不敢负责的思想。会议认为：过去，成绩是主要的，绝不能因为有了缺点和错误就泄气或者上下互相抱怨。重要的问题，是接受教训改进工作。会议强调，今后在农业技术推广工作中，上级还是应该提出计划和要求的，但这必须要和基层单位的因地制宜、因时制宜的推广工作巧妙地结合起来。
    会议对明年全省的农业技术措施也做了一些规定。对推广良种方面必须严格执行充分的地区试验和多点示范的工作方法，对拟推广地区的土地肥沃程度、水利条件等要做好调查研究，关于肥料工作，应该积极从推广绿肥、提高沤肥技术、根据条件推广过磷酸钙等方面着手，切实提高积肥技术和施肥方法。对于新式农具的推广、植物保护工作、合理密植以及增大复种面积等问题，都应在调查研究、积极稳步的基础上逐步提高。
