Xinhua News Agency, Kangding, December 13th: The personnel of the Central慰问团 First Sub-Delegation, divided into five groups, are braving wind and snow, crossing mountains and rivers, and conducting in-depth visits to the vast rural areas and pastures of various counties in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.

The慰问团 has been warmly welcomed by the Tibetan people along the Kang-Tibet Highway and in the river valleys of the Yalong River and Jinsha River. When the慰问团 arrived in Yajiang County, people of all ethnic groups lit pine smoke on the roofs and sacred mountains, blew conch shells according to the most solemn ethnic etiquette, and set up tea stations along the way. In this county town with only over a hundred households, more than eight hundred people warmly welcomed the慰问团 on both banks of the Yalong River. Xinlong County is a mountain town where over a thousand farmers from five townships are undergoing democratic reforms. The慰问团 personnel visited six townships within Xinlong County.

In late November and early December, the慰问团 held慰问 rallies of thousands of people in various counties, conveying the deep concern and greetings of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the people of all ethnic groups, and presented慰问 gifts, winter clothing, relief grain, and commemorative badges to the local people. The慰问团 also held separate symposiums for upper-class figures and religious figures, symposiums for farmer and herdsman representatives, symposiums for village and township cadres, and symposiums for families of martyrs and military personnel in various places, listened to opinions and requests from all parties, and visited Lama temples, distributing alms.

In recent days, the song and dance troupe, film projection team, and medical team of the慰问团 have been conducting慰问 performances, showing films, and treating diseases for the people of all ethnic groups in various places.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 13th: The Central慰问团 Fifth Sub-Delegation arrived in Zhongdian County, a Tibetan-populated area on the northwestern Yunnan Plateau, and held a grand慰问 rally on the plateau grassland surrounded by snow mountains on the 10th.

At the meeting, Zhang Chong, head of the Fifth Sub-Delegation, on behalf of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, extended cordial greetings to the Tibetan, Yi, Han, and other ethnic groups, local troops, government agencies, ethnic public figures, and monastic and secular officials, and explained in detail the Party's ethnic and religious policies. The慰问团 presented gifts to local leading agencies and mass organizations, as well as to the responsible cadres of Tibetan, Yi, and other ethnic groups in these units. Subsequently, the heads of these units all spoke, unanimously thanking Chairman Mao for his concern. Songmou Living Buddha, deputy head of the Fifth Sub-Delegation, said in his thank-you speech: "I am both a member of the 慰问团 and a recipient of慰问. On behalf of the Tibetan people and religious figures, I extend my sincere thanks to the Central Committee and Chairman Mao. In the future, I will use practical actions to unite the people of all ethnic groups and actively participate in the preparatory work for the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture."

In the evening, the慰问团 held a joint celebration with the local people.
