　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A wild silkworm that eats willow leaves and spins naturally light coffee-colored silk – the willow silkworm – has been discovered by Ding Hanyong and Dai Yuanxi, young teaching assistants at the East China Textile Engineering Institute.

　　Each cocoon of this silkworm can produce 350 meters of silk. The extensibility of the silk is similar to that of domestic silkworm silk, and the single-fiber strength is even higher than that of domestic silkworm silk. The pupae of the willow silkworm are also particularly large, containing a large amount of fat and rich nitrogenous substances, making them a valuable industrial raw material.

　　These two teaching assistants, after nearly a year of breeding and research, have confirmed that the willow silkworm has strong vitality. Temperatures between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit are suitable for it, damp leaves have no effect on it, and it only takes about 24 days from ant silkworm to cocoon formation. It can be raised in spring, summer and autumn.

　  华东发现新蚕种——柳蚕
    据新华社讯　一种吃柳叶吐天然浅咖啡色丝的野蚕——柳蚕，被华东纺织工学院青年助教丁汉镛和戴元熙发现。
    这种蚕的每颗茧可以缫出三百五十公尺长的丝。丝的延伸性同家蚕丝相仿佛，单纤维强力比家蚕丝还高。柳蚕的蛹也特别粗大，含有大量的脂肪和丰富的含氮物质，是一种很有价值的工业原料。
    这两位助教经过近一年来的饲养和研究证实，柳蚕的生活力很强，华氏七十度到九十度之间的温度对它都很合适，湿叶对它没有什么影响，从蚁蚕到结茧只需要二十四天左右，春夏秋三季都可以饲养。
