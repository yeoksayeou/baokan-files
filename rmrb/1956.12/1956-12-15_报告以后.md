    After the Report
    A certain leader: How was today's report? Even without instructions from higher-ups, I've long wanted to talk about these issues. As you know, I've always opposed the cult of personality!
    A certain staff member: Leader, this report was truly excellent! It was well-organized and substantial, really leaving the cult of personality supporters with no ground to stand on! Yes, leader, you have always opposed the cult of personality; your correctness lies in this.
    A certain leader: This is just a little bit of what I've learned. You must remember that we should be humble at all times; I am just like that.

    报告以后
    某首长：今天的报告作的怎样？没有上级的指示，我也早想把这些问题讲一讲了。你是知道的，我一向就反对个人崇拜！
    某工作人员：首长这个报告实在太好了！有条理、有内容，真把个人崇拜者批判得无立足之地了！是啊，首长一向是反对个人崇拜的，您的正确就在这里。
    某首长：这不过是我一点点的学习收获罢了。你们应当记住，我们在任何时候都应该谦虚，我就是这样的。
