Dangerous “Dance Parties”
　　By our reporter Xi Ping
    The dance parties held in some factories in Shanghai can no longer be called legitimate cultural and recreational activities, but have become places of extravagance, waste, and moral corruption.

    The fashion of holding dance parties is currently quite prevalent in Shanghai's factories and organizations. Every weekend or holiday evening, one can see brightly lit and loud dance party scenes almost everywhere. Dancing is originally a legitimate cultural entertainment. However, according to a recent investigation by a Shanghai Municipal Industrial Party Committee on the situation of dance parties held in factories, many units' dance parties have strayed far from the legitimate purpose of "enliven cultural and recreational life," and some very unhealthy tendencies have emerged: extravagance and waste, embezzlement and corruption, gathering crowds for fights... in various forms, with extremely bad influence.

    The most common situation is extravagance and waste. According to the investigation, the State-owned Shanghai Broadcasting Equipment Factory and two other factories, two of which have their own considerable venues, still rent large dance halls to hold dance parties. They have rented almost all the originally famous dance venues in Shanghai, such as the Four Sisters Dance Hall, the Ai'erlin Dance Hall, the Da Hu Storytelling Theater..., all of which have seen their presence. The grand scale requires money, so they adopt the method of selling dance tickets, with prices ranging from one or two jiao to even six or eight jiao. Sometimes, a "black market" even appears, and embezzlement of ticket money naturally follows.

    The problem is not just spending more money. More noteworthy is that many units' dance parties have actually become a re-edition of the dissolute old-style dance halls before liberation; becoming a medium for social hooligans to infiltrate factories and lure workers into depravity. Some factories in Shanghai's Tilanqiao District have only a dozen or a little over a hundred people, but when holding dance parties, there are often as many as six hundred or more dancers. Among these dancers, there are "ruffians," prostitutes, and suspected counter-revolutionaries, truly a mixed bag. At some dance parties, even yellow songs from the period of enemy and puppet rule are openly broadcasted...

    These unhealthy factors seriously erode the ideological consciousness of workers, especially young workers. Now, a group of "dance fanatics" has emerged in many factories. Their interest in dancing is far greater than their interest in work and study. They inquire about dance parties all day long and try to get dance tickets everywhere. Because of dancing, they often doze off during the day and lack energy for production. Some young apprentices, who were originally good, have been influenced by these things after entering the factory. After returning home, they demand beautiful clothes from their parents and have no interest in work or study; some have even fallen into stealing. There are also a small number of workers who gather at the gates of middle schools whenever dance parties are held, seeking female students as dance partners, causing some young students to have no interest in studying. And this kind of unrestrained licentious life is also one of the factors causing the corruption of moral discipline among employees.

    This harmful phenomenon cannot be allowed to continue! The Party and trade union organizations in enterprises cannot regard this phenomenon as a trivial matter. Of course, to change this situation, simple and crude methods cannot be adopted, nor can an order be issued to prohibit all dance parties, nor can employees be prohibited from dancing; but political and ideological education and communist moral education should be strengthened for employees, and employees should be actively guided to carry out legitimate and beneficial cultural and recreational activities so that the legitimate demands of employees can be met. Only in this way can unhealthy factors be eliminated, and the cultural and recreational activities (including dancing) within enterprises can be truly brought onto the right track.

### 危险的“舞会”

　　危险的“舞会”
　　本报记者　习平
    上海某些工厂举行的跳舞晚会，已经不能称为正当的文化娱乐活动，而变成铺张浪费败坏道德的场所了。
    举行舞会的风气，目前在上海的工厂、机关里颇为盛行，每逢周末或假日的晚上，几乎到处可以看到灯火辉煌、乐声四扬的舞会场面。跳舞本来是一种正当的文化娱乐。但据最近上海市一个工业党委对工厂里举行舞会的情况的调查结果证明，有不少单位的舞会已经远远离开了“活跃文娱生活”这个正当的目的，出现了一些很不健康的倾向：铺张浪费者有之，贪污腐化者有之，聚众斗殴者有之……形形色色，影响极坏。
    最普遍的情形是铺张浪费。据调查，国营上海广播器材厂等三个工厂，其中有两个厂自己都有不小的场地，但举行舞会却要去租用大舞场。他们几乎租遍了原来上海出名的跳舞场所，什么四姐妹舞厅、爱而林舞厅、大沪书场……，都有过他们的足迹，排场大了要花钱，于是就采用卖舞票的办法，票价由一角、两角、甚至卖到六角、八角，有时竟出现了“黑市”，贪污票钱的事，当然也随之出现。
    问题还不只是多花些钱而已。更值得注意的是，好些单位的舞会，实际上成为解放前放荡淫佚的旧式舞场的再版；成为社会上流氓分子混进工厂、引诱工人堕落的一个媒介。上海提篮桥区有些工厂只有十几个人或一百多人，但举行舞会时，舞客常常多至六百多人。这些舞客中“阿飞”也有，私娼也有，反革命嫌疑分子也有，真是形形色色。有些舞会上，甚至公然播送敌伪统治时期的黄色歌曲……。
    这些不健康的因素，严重地侵蚀了工人特别是青年工人的思想意识，现在在不少工厂里出现了一批
  “舞迷”，他们对跳舞的兴趣远比工作、学习的兴趣大得多，成天打听哪里有舞会，到处设法弄舞票。因为跳舞，常常弄得白天打瞌睡，生产没有劲。有些青年艺徒，本来很好，进厂后受了这些影响，回家后向父母闹着要漂亮衣服，工作学习无心；有的因此而堕落到偷窃。还有少数的工人，每到举行舞会时就聚集到中学校的门口，找女学生作舞伴，弄得一些青年学生无心学习。而这种没有约束的放荡生活，也是造成职工道德纪律败坏的因素之一。
    不能让这种有害的现象继续下去了！企业的党和工会组织不能把这种现象视作无关轻重的小事。当然，要改变这种状况，不能采取简单粗暴的办法，不能下一道命令禁止举行一切舞会，也不能禁止职工去跳舞；而应当对职工加强政治思想教育和共产主义道德教育，积极地引导职工开展正当的、有益的文化娱乐活动，使职工的正当要求能够得到满足。这样才能消除不健康的因素，把企业内部的文娱活动
  （包括跳舞在内），真正拉到正当的轨道上来。
