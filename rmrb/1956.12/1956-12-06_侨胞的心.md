　　The Hearts of Overseas Chinese
　　Ma Jinglong
　　During the performance tour of the Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe in Paris, it received meticulous care and attention from the overseas Chinese in France. Many overseas Chinese squeezed time out of their busy work or studies to assist us day and night; many overseas Chinese repeatedly invited us to visit their homes, and some even offered to treat us to a meal with the flavor of the motherland thousands of miles away overseas... Their enthusiasm deeply moved us.
　　One overseas Chinese told me that they always received various delegations from the motherland like seeing their own relatives. He said, "This is because we overseas Chinese and our compatriots in the country are of one heart. Caring for and helping the delegations sent by the motherland is to express our love for the motherland."
　　On November 3rd, at the reception for overseas Chinese in France held by the Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe, I deeply felt the overseas Chinese's love for the motherland. At this reception, about a thousand overseas Chinese in France met with the actors of the Chinese Acrobatic Arts Troupe.
　　Liu Yi, the head of the Acrobatic Arts Troupe, briefly introduced the general situation of the motherland's construction at the reception, and conveyed the motherland people's meticulous care for the overseas Chinese.
　　The actors of the Acrobatic Arts Troupe performed many wonderful programs. These news about the motherland and the performances of the motherland's art were warmly welcomed by the overseas Chinese. The children of overseas Chinese who were born abroad and had never been to the motherland were even more delighted. Among these children, some of them could not speak Chinese because their mothers were mostly French. However, as soon as they saw us, relatives from the motherland, they ran over to hug and kiss us, or snuggled affectionately beside us. An overseas Chinese pointed to these children and said to me, "You know, how important a place the motherland occupies in their young hearts!"
　　The songs of the motherland were constantly playing in the hall, and people poured out their innermost feelings to each other like relatives who had been separated for a long time. At this joyous moment, many overseas Chinese recalled the humiliation they suffered in the past when they were dependent on others like orphans. An old overseas Chinese with graying temples said with tears in his eyes, "In the past, under the eyes of others, we were humble and subservient, not daring to raise our heads or speak loudly..." A young overseas Chinese said loudly, "Today, our motherland has stood up like a giant, and we have also raised our heads!"
　　The overseas Chinese have infinite yearning for the thriving motherland, and many are preparing to return to the motherland; some have already booked train tickets, ship tickets, or plane tickets; some are going through the procedures for returning to the country; and some are determined to enrich themselves and prepare to contribute their strength to the motherland when they return to the country in the future. An overseas Chinese said to me, "Although I have been here for more than thirty years, my heart is always in the motherland!"
　　The hearts of overseas Chinese yearn for the motherland. Similarly, the motherland deeply cares for its children living overseas. The compatriots of the motherland are warmly waiting for the return of overseas Chinese. (Attached picture)

　　侨胞的心
　　马景龙
    中国杂技艺术团在巴黎演出的期间，受到旅法侨胞们无微不至的关怀和照顾。很多侨胞从繁忙的工作或学习中挤出时间来，不分昼夜地来协助我们；很多侨胞一再邀请我们到他们家里去作客，有的还提出要请我们在千里迢迢的海外吃一餐祖国风味的饭菜……。他们的热情，使我们深深受到感动。
    有一位侨胞告诉我：他们对来自祖国的各种代表团，总是像看到亲人一样地来接待。他说：“这是因为，我们海外侨胞和国内同胞是一条心。对祖国派来的代表团的关心和帮助，就是表达我们对祖国的热爱。”
    在11月3日，中国杂技艺术团举行的旅法华侨招待会上，我深切地体会到侨胞们这种热爱祖国的感情。在这次招待会上，约有一千位旅法的侨胞同中国杂技艺术团的演员们见了面。
    杂技艺术团柳夷团长在招待会上简单地介绍了祖国建设的概况，并且转达了祖国人民对于海外侨胞的无微不至的关怀。
    杂技艺术团的演员们表演了许多精彩节目。这些有关祖国的消息和祖国艺术的表演，受到侨胞们的热烈欢迎。那些在国外出生而从来没有到过祖国的华侨子女，更是兴高采烈。在这些孩子中有一部分因为他们的母亲大多数是法国人，所以不会说中国话。可是，他们一见到我们来自祖国的亲人，就跑过来搂抱、亲吻，或者深情地偎依在我们身旁。一位侨胞指着这些孩子对我说：“您知道，在他们的幼小的心灵里，祖国占据着多么重要的地位呀！”
    大厅里不断地放送着祖国的歌曲，人们像久别重逢的亲人一样，尽情地倾吐着自己的心里话。在这个欢欣的时刻，不少侨胞回忆起了过去他们像孤儿一样寄人篱下所受的屈辱。一位鬓角已发白了的老侨胞?着一汪泪水说：“过去我们在人家眼皮底下，低三下四的，头也不敢抬，话也不敢大声说……。”一个青年侨胞大声地说道：“今天，我们的祖国已经像巨人一样站起来了，我们也抬起头了！”
    侨胞们对于蒸蒸日上的祖国有着无限的向往，许多人都准备回到祖国来；有的已经订好车票、船票或飞机票；有的正在办理回国手续；有的决心努力充实自己准备将来归国为祖国贡献出力量。一位侨胞对我说：“我在这里虽然已经三十多年了，可是我的心却无时无刻不在祖国！”
    侨胞的心向往着祖国。同样，祖国也深切地关怀着它生活在海外的子女。祖国的同胞正热情地等待着海外侨胞的归来。（附图片）
