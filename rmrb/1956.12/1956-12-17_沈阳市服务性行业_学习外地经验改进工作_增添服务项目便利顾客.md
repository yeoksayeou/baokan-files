Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 13th - Since learning from other regions, the service industry in Shenyang has made many improvements in its service work. Since the joint state-private ownership transformation this spring, the city's service industry has been paying attention to improving its service work. In September, the deputy manager of the service company led six cadres to visit Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin to learn from the advanced experiences of service industries in various places. Now, according to the experiences of other regions, the service industry in Shenyang has added many service items and facilities to benefit customers. To facilitate travelers in finding hotels, the hotel industry has established three hotel liaison stations in the Heping, Shenhe, and Beishi districts, which introduce more than 1,000 travelers to accommodation locations free of charge every day, eliminating the difficulties faced by out-of-town guests unfamiliar with the area. Hotels throughout the city generally provide services such as mailing letters, buying train tickets, theater tickets, and bath tickets for guests. In large hotels, daily newspapers, train schedules, and city traffic route maps are available. Large bathhouses in the city have added kiosks, barbershops, and laundry rooms, and some bathhouses have also added shoe-shining services.

Industries such as photography, hairdressing, and laundry have all increased service items. Large photo studios have added twenty-one types of photography, such as "shadow in shadow," and photo studios in Heping, Beishi, and other districts have also added children's photography departments and three-dimensional sets. The photography industry has also organized suburban service teams to take photos for farmers in rural areas. Service industries such as photography, bathing, and hairdressing also provide preferential treatment to pregnant women by giving them priority service.
