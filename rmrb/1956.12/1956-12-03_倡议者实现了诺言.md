Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: The state-owned Beijing First and Second Cotton Textile Factories, which jointly initiated a factory-to-factory competition among cotton textile factories nationwide, have fully met the competition conditions and have reached the 1957 production level ahead of schedule.

　　This year, these two factories successively organized forces to learn from fraternal factories, strengthened factory management and technical leadership, and promoted nearly three hundred advanced experiences, gradually improving the balance of plan completion. By the third quarter, the two factories were able to carry out production evenly on a weekly and daily basis. The percentage of first-class cotton yarn exceeded the national requirements, the percentage of first-class cloth reached over 99%, and substandard cloth was basically eliminated.

　　Through the competition, the workers of these two factories have gradually established a habit of thrift, saving nearly 300,000 jin of raw cotton in less than a year.

　　The two factories also completed the trial production of more than 30 new products on schedule.

　　倡议者实现了诺言
    据新华社2日讯　向全国棉纺织厂联合倡议开展厂际竞赛的国营北京第一和第二两个棉纺织厂，已经全部实现竞赛条件，并且提前达到了1957年生产水平。
    这两个厂，今年先后组织力量向兄弟厂学习，加强了工厂管理和技术领导，推广了将近三百项先进经验，使完成计划的均衡性逐渐提高。到第三季度，这两个厂就已经能够按周、按日均衡地进行生产，棉纱上等品率超过了国家的要求，正布率都达到99％以上，基本上消灭了次布。
    通过竞赛，这两个厂的职工还逐渐树立了节约风气，不到一年，就节约了近三十万斤原棉。
    这两个厂还按期完成了三十多种新产品的试制工作。
