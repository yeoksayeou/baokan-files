    In the East Pakistan Mass Rally Welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai
    Speech by Chairman Bhashani of the East Pakistan People's League
    It is difficult for us to express in words the joy we feel at Your Excellency's solemn visit to East Pakistan. On behalf of the men, women, old and young of Pakistan, I would like to extend our most heartfelt welcome to Your Excellency. We are deeply moved by the message of goodwill and friendship from the people of our great neighboring country, China, that you bring to us. Through you, we express our most sincere greetings and friendship to the Chinese people. The existing cultural ties and friendly relations between our two peoples are not new. As far back as 2,500 years ago, our two countries initially established cultural and friendly ties through the great Chinese travelers Xuanzang and Faxian. We have maintained this friendly relationship for many centuries. Through Prime Minister Suhrawardy's recent visit to China and your visit to Pakistan, a new page has been opened in this old friendship. Our two peoples have much in common. We have both suffered long periods of oppression and persecution by foreign imperialists. We have both broken the shackles of slavery and stood up as free nations. We have undertaken the task of transforming and rebuilding our respective countries and nations. The great achievements you have made in the revival of your country have been praised by the people of Pakistan. We are eager to benefit from the experience of our great neighbor, China.
    Our respected guest, friendship and peace with all countries in the world is our motto. Therefore, we fully support and uphold the spirit of the historic Bandung Conference. We sincerely hope to see the end of the heinous colonial rule over Asian and African countries, and the realization of peace in Asia, Africa, and throughout the world. For this purpose, we have rebuilt our friendship with our great neighbor, China. We believe that the friendship between Pakistan and China will guarantee peace in Asia and help maintain world peace. Therefore, we reiterate our firm determination to strengthen the friendship between Pakistan and China day by day.
    Your Excellency, on behalf of the people of Pakistan, I once again wish you and your government all the best, and may Allah help you.

    在欢迎周恩来总理的东巴基斯坦群众大会上
    东巴基斯坦人民联盟巴沙尼主席的讲话
    我们很难用言语来表达我们对阁下隆重地访问东巴基斯坦而感到的愉快的心情。我谨代表巴基斯坦男女老幼，对阁下表示我们最衷心的欢迎。你带给我们的伟大邻邦中国人民的亲善和友谊的信息使我们深受感动。我们通过你，对中国人民表示我们最诚挚的问候和友谊。我们两国人民现有的文化联系和友好关系并不是新东西，远在二千五百年以前，通过伟大的中国旅行家玄奘和法显，我们两国最初建立了文化联系和友好联系。许多世纪以来，我们一直保持了这种友好联系。通过我国总理苏拉瓦底先生最近访问中国和你这次访问巴基斯坦，这个旧有的友谊展开了新的一页。我们两国人民有许多共同的地方，我们都受过外国帝国主义者的长期压迫和迫害。我们两国都打破了奴役的枷锁，作为自由的国家而站起来了。我们已经肩负起改造和重建我们各自的国家和民族的任务。你们在你们的国家复兴方面取得的巨大成就受到了巴基斯坦人民的赞扬。我们热切希望从我们伟大的中国邻邦的经验中得到好处。
    我们的尊敬的贵宾，同世界上所有的国家友好相处和和平是我们的口号。因此，我们完全支持和维护具有历史意义的万隆会议的精神。我们衷心希望看到对亚非国家的万恶的殖民主义统治结束，和平在亚洲和非洲以及在全世界实现。为了这个目的，我们重建了我们同我们伟大的邻邦中国的友谊。我们相信，巴基斯坦和中国的友谊将能保障亚洲的和平，并且有助于维护世界和平。因此，我们重申我们要日益加强巴中两国友谊的坚定决心。
    阁下，我再次代表巴基斯坦人民谨祝你和你的政府一切顺利，愿真主帮助你。
