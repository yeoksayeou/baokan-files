Xinhua News Agency, 30th - London Dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd stated in the House of Commons on the 29th that Britain would not withdraw all of its invading forces from Egypt until the goals of "international control" of the Suez Canal and the forced "clearing" of the entire canal were achieved. He announced that British and French forces only intend to "withdraw in stages" from Egypt.

Lloyd said that the United Nations resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of troops by Britain, France, and Israel was "unrealistic." He said that the assembly of the United Nations Emergency Force "is clearly of great importance in relation to the phased withdrawal of our own and French forces." In addition, there are also "other important issues to be considered," which are: the rapid "clearing" of the Suez Canal; and negotiations to reach a final resolution on the future management of the canal. He also hinted that the date for any further withdrawal of British and French troops would be much later than people expected.

Lloyd believes that the United States supports the British and French "phased withdrawal" plan. He said that the US Chief Representative to the United Nations, Lodge, in explaining the United Nations resolution on "immediate" withdrawal, said that "'immediate' means a phased action."

The Labor Party's main spokesman on foreign affairs, Bevan, called the "phased withdrawal," "clearing the canal," and "the future of the canal" mentioned by Lloyd as three "ominous" points. He criticized the government for linking the assembly of the United Nations forces, the phased withdrawal of British and French forces, and forcing Egypt to make some kind of declaration on the future of the canal. He believes that this creates a gap between Britain and the United Nations and the United States.

Bevan further asked: Is the government unwilling to comply with the United Nations resolution unless it receives some guarantee on the future of the canal? Lloyd said that this is an issue that must be discussed with ally France.

Liberal Party leader Grimond also asked: Is it not necessary for British troops to remain in Port Said until a final solution to the canal issue is reached? Lloyd evaded the question. He only said: "I am willing to consider this issue."

### 扬言英法只打算“分阶段”撤军　劳埃德竟横蛮提出撤军条件

　　扬言英法只打算“分阶段”撤军
　　劳埃德竟横蛮提出撤军条件
    据新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德29日在下院表示，不达到“国际管制”苏伊士运河和强行“清理”整条运河的目的，英国就不从埃及撤出全部侵略军。他宣布英法军队只打算“分阶段撤出”埃及。
    劳埃德说联合国要求英国、法国和以色列立即撤军的决议是“不现实”的。他说，联合国紧急部队的集结“显然同我们自己的和法国的军队的分阶段撤退有重要关系”。此外，也还有“应予考虑的其他重要问题”，这些问题就是：迅速“清理”苏伊士运河；进行谈判，以便就运河将来的管理问题取得最后的解决。他还暗示，英法军队再作某种撤退的日期，要比人们预料的迟得多。
    劳埃德认为，美国是支持英法的“分阶段撤军”计划的。他说，美国驻联合国首席代表洛奇在解释联合国关于“立即”撤军的决议的时候说过，“‘立即’的意思是一个分阶段的行动”。
    工党关于外交问题的主要发言人比万把劳埃德提到的“分阶段撤军”、“清理运河”和“运河的前途”称作“并列的不祥的”三点。他责备政府把联合国部队的集结、英法军队的分阶段撤退和强迫埃及就运河的前途发表某种宣言的作法互相联系起来。他认为，这就在英国同联合国和美国之间造成隔阂。
    比万进一步追问道：政府是不是非得到关于运河前途的某种保证就不愿意服从联合国的决议呢？劳埃德说，这是一个必须同盟国法国讨论的问题。
    自由党领袖格里蒙德也追问道：在运河问题获得最后解决前，是不是没有必要让英军留在塞得港？劳埃德避而不答。他只是说：“这个问题我愿意考虑。”
