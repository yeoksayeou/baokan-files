　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 22nd (Reporter Song He): Sichuan Province, which has more than 110 million mu of cultivated land, planted more than 180 million mu of crops this year. The province's crop replanting index has reached 161.6%. The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) once stipulated that in the area north of the Yangtze River and south of the Yellow River, Qinling Mountains, and Bailong River, the crop replanting index should be increased to 160% within twelve years, starting from 1956. Now, Sichuan Province has exceeded this target.

　　The person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture believes that the above achievements are a major victory achieved by Sichuan Province in changing the farming system after realizing the primary form of agricultural cooperativization this year.

　　Since this spring, all parts of the province have used the favorable conditions of cooperativization to actively build water conservancy projects and accumulate and manufacture fertilizer, expanding the irrigated area by more than 9 million mu, and increasing natural fertilizer by one time compared with last year. This provides a material guarantee for implementing measures to change the farming system and increase the crop replanting index throughout the province.

　　This year, the province's replanted area increased by more than 8.8 million mu compared to last year. Last year, the planting area of double-cropping rice was 80,000 mu. This year, more than 6 million mu of early rice and more than 4 million mu of late rice were planted, increasing rice production by more than 700 million jin. At the same time, an additional season of late autumn crops such as corn, sweet potatoes, and potatoes was planted on more than 3 million mu of land, increasing grain production by more than 250 million jin.

　　The person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture said that the above facts prove that increasing the crop replanting index is an effective measure for Sichuan Province to strive for increased production of grain and other crops. Next year, the province will continue to find ways to increase the replanted area of cultivated land.

    积极地慎重地改革了耕作制度
    四川耕地复种指数达到161.6％
    新华社成都22日电　新华社记者宋禾报道：拥有一亿一千多万亩耕地的四川省，今年种植了一亿八千多万亩农作物。全省耕地复种指数已经达到161.6％。全国农业发展纲要（草案）中，曾经规定：在长江以北、黄河、秦岭、白龙江以南地区，从1956年开始，在十二年内把耕地的复种指数提高到160％，现在，四川省已经超过了这个指标。
    四川省农业部门的负责人认为，上述成绩是四川省今年实现初级形式的农业合作化以后，在改变耕作制度方面取得的重大胜利。
    从今年春天以来，全省各地利用合作化的有利条件，积极兴修水利和积肥造肥，扩大了灌溉面积九百多万亩，自然肥料比去年增加了一倍。这就为在全省范围内实行改变耕作制度、提高耕地复种指数的措施提供了物质保证。
    今年全省耕地的复种面积比去年增加了八百八十多万亩。去年双季稻的种植面积是八万亩，今年种植了六百多万亩早稻和四百多万亩晚稻，增产了稻谷七亿多斤。同时，在三百多万亩土地上增种了一季玉米、红薯、马铃薯等晚秋作物，共增产粮食二亿五千万斤以上。
    四川省农业部门的负责人说，上述事实证明，提高耕地复种指数是四川省争取粮食及其他作物增产的有效措施。明年，全省将继续设法提高耕地的复种面积。
