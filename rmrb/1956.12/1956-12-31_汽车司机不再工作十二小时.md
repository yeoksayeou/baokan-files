Response to Criticism

    Car Drivers No Longer Work Twelve Hours
    A letter from the Jining Branch of the State-owned Shandong Provincial Automobile Transportation Company says: The People's Daily's criticism on August 24 of our company's car drivers working excessive hours is completely accurate.
    In addition to conducting a thorough self-examination, our company has organized a working group to specifically help each production unit research and solve this problem, resolutely reducing car drivers' working hours to below ten hours.

专栏：对批评的反应

    汽车司机不再工作十二小时
    国营山东省汽车运输公司济宁分公司来信说：8月24日，人民日报对我公司汽车司机工作时间过长的批评完全属实。
    我们除作深刻检查外，并且已经由公司组织工作组，具体帮助各生产单位研究解决这个问题，坚决将汽车司机的工作时间压缩在十小时以下。
