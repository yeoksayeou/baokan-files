　　Concentrate Use, Proper Arrangement
　　Wang Pu
    Our country's construction scale expands year by year, and investment increases year by year, and 1957 is certainly no exception. However, expanding the scale and increasing investment are not the same as scattering resources everywhere; the principle of focusing on key construction projects must always be adhered to. The Shenyang Railway Administration reduced some minor projects that could be postponed and compressed its original basic construction investment plan for next year in order to save more money for the state to build the most important projects. This approach is very correct, and all departments and units planning to carry out basic construction next year should do the same.
    However, we cannot be satisfied with just cutting and compressing. We must also see how to cut and how to compress. If we simply eliminate all but the key projects, cutting a few percentage points across the board regardless of the project, then problems will arise. For example, the following might happen: a project may seem "minor" to one department and is eliminated in the ranking. However, for the key project of another department, it is an indispensable and important supporting project. Without it, construction cannot proceed smoothly, or the production capacity cannot be fully utilized after completion. It may also happen that, in order to ensure key projects, investments in the renovation and expansion of existing enterprises and technical measures are cut. However, it is not considered that cutting these will slow down the current production growth rate, which in turn will affect the construction of key projects. Therefore, on the one hand, we must resolutely compress, and on the other hand, we must make proper arrangements. The Shenyang Railway Administration carefully investigated the transportation needs of other departments for the section of railway under its jurisdiction and carefully calculated the potential of existing lines before determining which projects could be postponed or not built. The investment plan compressed in this way is relatively sound. This point is also worth learning from by all basic construction units.
    It is not easy to concentrate the use of funds while striving for balance in all aspects, and to appropriately reduce secondary projects while making proper arrangements. However, human effort can make a difference. If the investigation and research work is done well and the overall perspective is strong, who can say that it is impossible to approach and achieve this requirement?

　　集中使用，妥善安排
　　王朴
    我们国家的建设规模年年都要扩大，投资年年都要增加，1957年当然也不例外。但是，扩大规模，增加投资，并不等于到处开花，重点建设的方针是始终都要坚持的。沈阳铁路管理局削减了一些次要的、可以缓建的工程项目，压缩了原定的明年基本建设投资计划，以便省出更多的钱来让国家去建设最重要的工程，这种做法非常正确，一切打算在明年进行基本建设的部门和单位都应当这样做。
    但是，不能仅仅满足于削和压。还要看怎样削，怎样压。若是简单化地除去重点工程其他一笔勾消，不管什么项目齐头砍掉百分之几，那可就要出毛病。譬如，就可能发生这样的事：在这个部门看来，是个“次要”项目，排起队来要被挤掉。但是，对那个部门的重点工程来说，却是个少不了的重要配合项目，没有它就不能顺利建设，或者建成后也不能充分发挥生产能力。也可能发生这样的事：为了保证重点工程，削掉了一些现有企业的改建、扩建投资和技术措施费用。但是，却没有想到，削掉了这些，眼前的生产增长速度就要放慢，反过来又会影响重点工程的建设。因此，一方面既要坚决压缩，一方面又要妥善安排。沈阳铁路管理局仔细调查了其他部门对自己所属这段铁路的运输需要，又仔细计算了现有线路还有哪些潜力可以发挥，然后才确定可以缓建和不建的项目。这样压缩下来的投资计划是比较稳妥的。这一点，也同样值得各个基本建设单位学习。
    既要集中使用资金，又要力求各方面平衡；既要适当削减次要项目，又要妥善安排。这当然不容易。然而，事在人为，如果调查研究工作做得好，全局观念强，谁能说接近和达到这个要求是不可能的？
