    A Stingy Person Has Few Friends
    (Mongolian Proverb)
    A lazy horse travels a long road,
    A stingy person has few friends.
    Better to die for the masses than to live for wealth.
    Love your friend more than your own life,
    Even in death, there is life.

    吝啬的人朋友远
    （蒙古谚语）
    懈惰的马路程远，
    吝啬的人朋友远。
    为财而生，不如为众而死。
    爱朋友如胜过生命，
    纵然死去还有生命。
        郝苏民辑译
