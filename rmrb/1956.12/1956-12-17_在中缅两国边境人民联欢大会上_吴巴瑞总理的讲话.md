Esteemed Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Marshal He Long, Provincial Governor, and all brothers and sisters participating in the conference:

I am very happy and pleased to have this opportunity to come to the People's Republic of China. I am very grateful to Premier Zhou and other leaders of the People's Republic of China for giving me the opportunity to have this cordial conversation with my Chinese brothers and sisters.

It is not necessary to elaborate on the historically friendly relations between the people of Burma and China. As all of you know, the Burmese people affectionately call the Chinese "Pauk-Phaw," which in Burmese is a term for siblings born of the same parents. As far as I know, the Chinese have always regarded the Burmese as their own family in the past and at present.

Not only are our people so close, but there has also been mutual friendship and respect between the Chinese government and the Burmese government for more than two thousand years. In this extremely long historical period, there have been at most only two or three conflicts between the two sides. This is rare and significant in world history. In ancient times, wars often occurred between neighboring countries in the world. However, Sino-Burmese relations were not like this. There have only been two or three conflicts in history. Based on this point, it is clear without saying how friendly our two countries are.

Especially in the recent two or three years, Sino-Burmese relations have improved significantly. On June 29, 1954, the joint statement issued by our friend Premier Zhou Enlai and the then Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu, brought about significant development and improvement in Sino-Burmese friendly relations. The most meaningful point in this joint statement is the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence agreed upon by both sides. Everyone already knows these five principles. However, here, I would like to briefly mention these five principles again: First, mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty; second, mutual non-aggression; third, mutual non-interference in internal affairs ; Fourthly, equality and mutual benefit; Fifthly, peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Today, our two countries have faithfully implemented these five principles, and we must faithfully continue to implement these principles in the future. I am extremely satisfied that our two countries have very good relations due to the implementation of the Five Principles. We firmly believe that if countries with different political and economic systems can sincerely implement these five principles according to this example, international tensions will ease and world peace will be achieved quickly. International relations have improved significantly as a wide range of people who love world peace have gradually established their belief in these five principles. With the more widespread implementation of these five principles by various countries, world peace will surely make obvious progress and success.

Our two countries have not only strictly abided by these five principles, but our goals are also the same. The People's Republic of China is a large country that is building itself into a truly people's country, and the Union of Burma is also building itself into a truly people's country. Although we have differences in methods in the process of building a people's country, our goals are the same. We are both countries that are doing everything possible to improve people's living standards in various ways.

Our two countries are also countries that are making effective efforts for peace. We are both opposed to war and accept the principle that disputes between countries should be resolved peacefully. Because we are friendly and trust each other, we are working to make our relationship an example that other countries can imitate.

If we look back at the past history of our two countries, we can also find many similarities. The Chinese are a nation that is very rich in national self-esteem and has successfully preserved their national culture. The Burmese nation is also rich in national self-esteem. Even under the oppression of imperialism, we have still successfully preserved our national culture. We are both nations that love our motherland and cherish our motherland's culture. Historically, our relationship has always been very good. We both understand each other's attitudes. Therefore, Sino-Burmese relations have been friendly for two thousand years.

In the past, the people of our two countries were friendly, and today our goals are also the same. For the sake of world peace, we both accept and implement the Five Principles, and at the same time, we also have many things in common in culture. We believe that Burma and China, which have so many similarities, have been able to get along well in the past, and will undoubtedly be more friendly, closer and more respectful in our time. Therefore, our task is to work hard to promote this friendship and make it increasingly consolidated. We firmly believe that these efforts will definitely be successful.

Our two countries are very close neighbors. For example, in your villages, if neighbors can live in harmony, it can promote the unity of the whole village and bring happiness to the whole village. On the contrary, if the neighbors are not in harmony, the whole village will not be happy. In this way, it will not be possible to develop the economy. Not only that, but bad people from outside the village will take this opportunity to carry out robbery and theft. The same is true between countries. Therefore, it is necessary for our neighboring countries to be more friendly and united. If we can unite, it will be of great benefit to all of us. If we are not united, some bad people outside our country will carry out various conspiracies against us and bring great harm to us. Therefore, for our two neighboring countries, it is very important to develop friendly relations, enhance mutual understanding, and eliminate suspicions between each other. We must increasingly consolidate our friendship.

In international relations, the size of a country is not a fundamental issue. In the past, the relationship between large and small countries was often that large countries bullied small countries. The colonialism we condemn is the strong bullying the weak. As long as this evil colonial system of the big bullying the small and the strong arbitrarily manipulating the weak exists for one day, international tensions will exist and world peace will not be achieved. Therefore, we are sparing no effort to fight against this evil system of large countries bullying small countries and strong countries arbitrarily manipulating weak countries.

If countries, regardless of size, can establish their relations with each other on the principles of mutual respect and equal treatment, the edifice of peace that we all expect can be built. There is a Burmese saying: "Those who respect others will also be respected by others." This saying must be firmly implemented not only in the relationship between people, but also in international relations. Only in this way can we achieve the world peace we require and establish friendly relations between countries. If our two countries can get along friendly with each other on the basis of mutual respect and equality, the friendship between our two countries will be as continuous as running water and will form an indestructible and permanent friendship. The relationship between our two countries is based on the Five Principles, so I firmly believe that our friendship will last forever.

In building friendship between the two countries, the most important thing is the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of all ethnic groups on the borders of our two countries. We must make the greatest efforts to further consolidate the friendship between the residents of the border areas of the two countries.

As the understanding, friendship and unity of our brotherly border people are strengthened, the friendship and mutual respect between our two countries will also be developed and consolidated. In this regard, today's border people's friendship gathering is very important. Last year, a friendship gathering like this was held in Leki within the Union of Burma. That conference laid an important cornerstone for our Burmese-Chinese friendship and promoted the friendly relations between the border people of the two countries. Now, the second border people's friendship gathering is being held in Mangshi, China. This conference has also laid a cornerstone for Burmese-Chinese friendship. Undoubtedly, the friendship between the border people of the two countries will also be significantly developed. I believe that the border people's friendship gatherings to be held in the future will continue to consolidate the foundation of Burmese-Chinese friendship. If all countries in the world can follow the example of our two countries, international relations will be greatly eased. When talking about Burmese-Chinese friendship, I think it is impossible not to mention the fact that our two countries help each other. The economic relations between our two countries have developed unprecedentedly. I believe that the close economic relations between our two countries will continue to develop. We believe that this relationship should not be based on harming others to benefit oneself, but should be based on the principle of mutual benefit. Not only in economic relations, but also in cultural relations, it is developing satisfactorily. Our two countries have sent cultural delegations to each other and conducted fruitful cultural exchanges. According to historical records, about 1,200 years ago, Burma and China sent cultural delegations to each other. Due to this contact, the influence of Chinese music and dance can still be seen in Burmese music and dance. At the same time, the great Chinese poet Bai Juyi once praised Burmese music and dance in his poems. From this, it can be seen how long the history of cultural exchanges between our two countries is. What is important now is to consolidate the relationship between our two countries.

After talking about the economic and cultural situation, we must talk about the political situation. The political systems of our two countries are not exactly the same. However, our two countries agree that any country can freely choose the political system they like and build their own country according to their own national conditions. Therefore, we all accept the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries with different political and economic systems. If all countries can follow this example, then I believe that it will eliminate mutual fears and promote greater understanding between each other. In this way, I firmly believe that international tensions will gradually be eliminated. Therefore, I suggest that our two countries should set an example in implementing the Five Principles that we have accepted, so that all countries will accept these principles. The whole world is closely watching whether these five principles can be successful. If it is successful, there is no doubt that more countries will accept it. If it is not successful, many countries will laugh at us.

Therefore, let us at this border people's conference once again express our determination to continue to work hard to successfully implement these five principles. At the same time, let us work together to further develop the traditional friendship between our Burmese and Chinese people.

Let our two countries with common goals build our edifice of friendship on the basis of full understanding. Let Burma and China, which are effectively building peace in Asia and the world and strongly oppose the policy of war, join hands to solve various problems calmly and peacefully. Let the people of Burma and China, who love their motherland and have successfully defended their national culture, deal with various problems magnanimously and generously. Let the people of Burma and China, with the attitude of friendly neighbors and the spirit of mutual trust, prevent foreign conspiracies. Let the people of Burma and China, with the spirit of not distinguishing between the size of countries and "those who respect others will also be respected by others," live in harmony with each other on the principles of mutual respect and equality, and especially let the people of Burma and China make the greatest efforts to consolidate the friendly relations between the people on the borders of our two countries.

Long live Burmese-Chinese friendship!
Long live world peace!
Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!

### 在中缅两国边境人民联欢大会上  吴巴瑞总理的讲话

    在中缅两国边境人民联欢大会上
    吴巴瑞总理的讲话
    敬爱的周恩来总理、副总理贺龙元帅、省长和参加大会的各位兄弟姐妹们：
    我这次能有机会来到中华人民共和国，感到十分高兴和愉快。我非常感谢周总理和中华人民共和国其他领袖们，因为他们使我有机会对中国的兄弟姐妹们作这次亲切的谈话。
    不必多加叙述就可以了解缅中两国人民在历史上的友好关系。如各位朋友所知道的，缅甸人亲密地把中国人称做“胞波”，“胞波”是缅甸话，是对同胞生的兄弟姐妹的称呼。据我所知，中国人在过去和在目前也都一直把缅甸人看作自己的亲人。
    不仅在我们人民之间这样亲密，并且，在中国政府和缅甸政府之间，两千多年来也一直是互相友好和尊重的。在这段极为悠久的历史时期中，双方之间发生的冲突至多不过两三次。这在世界历史上是很少有的，很有意义的。在古代，世界上毗邻的国家之间都时常发生战争。但是，缅中关系却不是这样。在历史上仅仅发生过两三次冲突。根据这一点，不必多说就可以明白我们两国是如何的友好。
    特别是最近两三年以来，缅中关系得到了显著的改善。1954年6月29日，我们的朋友周总理和当时的缅甸联邦总理吴努所发表的联合声明，使缅中友好关系获得了显著的发展和改善。这个联合声明里最有意义的一点就是双方所同意的和平共处五项原则。各位早已知道这五项原则。但是，在这里，我愿意顺便再提一下这五项原则：第一，互相尊重领土和主权完整；第二，互不侵犯；第三，互不干涉内政；第四，平等互利；第五，不同社会制度的国家和平共处。今天，我们两国忠实地执行了这五项原则，今后我们也一定要忠实地继续执行这些原则。由于执行了五项原则，我们两国的关系非常良好，对于这一点，我极感满意。我们坚决相信，如果政治经济制度不同的各国能按照这一范例，诚恳地执行这五项原则，那么国际紧张局势将会缓和，世界和平也就会迅速实现。由于热爱世界和平的广大人士已逐渐树立了对这五项原则的信仰，国际关系也明显地有了改善。随着各国更普遍地实行这五项原则，世界和平一定会得到明显的进展和成功。
    我们两国不仅严格地遵守了这五项原则，而且我们的目标也是相同的。中华人民共和国是正在把自己建设为真正的人民国家的一个大国，缅甸联邦也是正在把自己建设为真正的人民的一个国家。我们在进行人民国家建设的过程中，在方法上虽有分歧，目标却是相同的。我们都是尽一切力量以各种方法在提高人民生活水平的国家。
    我们两国也都是为和平进行有效努力的国家。我们都反对战争，并且接受这样的原则，即各国的争端应该和平地求得解决。由于我们互相友好和信任，我们正在努力使我们间的关系成为各国可加模仿的范例。
    如果回顾我们两国过去的历史，也可以找到很多相同之处。中国人是非常富有民族自尊心而成功地保存了民族文化的一个民族。缅甸民族也是富有民族自尊心的，就是在帝国主义的压迫下，我们仍然成功地保有了我们的民族文化。我们都是热爱自己的祖国和爱护祖国文化的两个民族，在历史上我们的关系一直是非常良好的。我们都了解彼此的态度。因此，两千年以来的缅中关系一直是友好的。
    过去我们两国人民是友好的，今天我们的目标也是相同的。为了世界和平，我们都接受并执行着五项原则，同时在文化方面，我们之间也有着许多相同的地方。我们相信有着这许多相同点的缅中两国，既然在过去能够友好相处，在我们这个时代，无疑地将会更加友好、更加亲密和互相尊重。因此，我们的任务是在于努力促进这种友好，并且使它日益巩固。我们坚决相信，这些努力是一定会成功的。
    我们两国是非常亲密的邻邦。譬如在你们的村庄里，邻居如果能够和睦相处，就可以促成全村的团结，也可以给全村带来幸福。相反的，如果邻居不和的话，全村也就不会有幸福。这样也就无法去发展经济。不仅如此，而且村外的坏人，就会利用这个机会，来进行抢劫和偷盗。国家之间也是如此。因此，我们邻国之间需要更加友好和团结。如果我们能够团结，那么对我们大家就会有很大的好处。假如我们不团结，那么我们国家之外的一些坏人就会对我们进行各种阴谋活动，并且会给我们带来很大的危害。因此，对我们这两个邻国来说，要发展友好关系和增进互相谅解，消除彼此间的猜疑，是非常重要的。我们必须日益巩固我们之间的友谊。
    在国际关系当中，国家的大小并不是基本的问题。过去大国和小国之间的关系往往是大国欺侮小国。我们所谴责的殖民主义，也就是强国欺侮弱国。只要这种大欺小、强欺弱的罪恶的殖民主义制度存在一天，国际紧张局势也就会存在，世界和平也就无法实现。因此，我们正不遗余力地对这种大国欺侮小国、强国任意摆布弱国的罪恶制度进行斗争。
    如果国和国之间，不论大小，能够以互相尊重和平等相处的原则，来建立彼此的关系的话，我们大家所期待的和平大厦就可建成。缅甸有句成语说：“敬人者，人亦敬之”。这句成语不仅在人和人的关系中，而且在国际关系中也是我们所必须坚决贯彻的。只有这样，才能取得我们所要求的世界和平，才能建立国和国之间的友好关系。如果，我们两国能够在互相尊重和平等的基础上友好相处的话，我们两国的友谊就会像流水一样切不断的，就会结成不可摧毁的永久友谊。我们两国的关系是建立在五项原则的基础上的，因此我坚信我们的友好将万古长存。
    在建立两国友谊方面，最重要的是我们两国边境上的各族人民之间的友好和相互了解。我们必须以最大的努力来进一步巩固两国边境居民的友谊。
    随着我们亲如兄弟的边境人民的了解、友谊和团结的加强，我们两国的友谊和互相尊重也将获得发展和巩固。在这方面，今天的边境人民联欢大会是非常重要的。去年在缅甸联邦境内的雷基曾举行过一次像这样的联欢大会。那次大会为我们缅中友好奠下了一块重要的基石，并且促进了两国边境人民的友好关系。现在，在中国境内的芒市又举行了第二次边境人民联欢大会。这次大会又为缅中友好奠下了一块基石。无疑地，两国边境人民的友谊也将获得显著的发展。我相信：今后将要举行的边境人民联欢大会也会使缅中友谊的基础不断地巩固。如果世界各国都能效法我们两国的榜样，国际关系就会大大缓和。在谈到缅中友好的时候，我认为不能不提到我们两国互相帮助的事实。我们两国的经济关系有了空前的发展。我相信，我们两国唇齿般的经济关系，将继续得到发展。我们认为，这种关系不应该建立在损人利己的基础上，而应该建立在互利的原则上。不仅在经济关系方面就是在文化关系方面也是令人满意地发展着。我们两国互相派遣了文化代表团，进行了有成效的文化交流。根据历史的记载，大约在一千二百年以前，缅中两国就曾经互相派遣过文化代表团。由于这种接触，在缅甸的音乐和舞蹈中至今还能看到中国音乐和舞蹈的影响。同时中国大诗人白居易在他的诗篇中曾经赞扬过缅甸音乐和舞蹈。由此可见，我们两国文化交流的历史是多么的悠久。目前重要的是巩固我们两国的关系。
    在谈了经济和文化方面的情况以后，不能不谈谈政治情况。我们两国的政治制度不是完全相同的。但是，我们两国同意任何国家都可以自由选择他们自己所喜欢的政治制度和根据自己国家的情况来建设自己的国家。因此，我们都接受政治制度和经济制度不同的国家可以和平共处的五项原则。假使，各国都能遵循这一范例，那么我相信就会消除相互之间的疑惧，而促使彼此之间更加谅解。这样，我坚决相信，国际紧张局势也就会逐渐消除。因此我建议，我们两国在执行我们所接受的五项原则的时候，应该做出榜样，来使所有的国家都接受这些原则。整个世界都在密切地注视着这五项原则能否成功。如果成功的话，毫无疑问，有更多的国家会接受它。如果不成功，一定会有许多国家嘲笑我们。
    因此，让我们在这个边民大会上再一次表示我们继续为成功地执行这五项原则而努力的决心。同时，让我们共同为进一步发展我们缅中人民的传统的友谊而努力。
    让具有共同目标的我们两国在取得充分谅解的基础上建立起我们的友好大厦。让正在有效地建立亚洲和世界和平、强烈反对战争政策的缅中两国，携起手来，冷静地和平地解决各项问题。让热爱自己祖国，并且成功地保卫了民族文化的缅中两国人民，同舟共济地宽洪大量地处理各项问题。让我们缅中两国人民以友好邻邦的态度和相互信任的精神，来防止外来的阴谋破坏。让我们缅中两国人民以不分国家大小和“敬人者人亦敬之”的精神，在互相尊重和平等的原则上和睦共处，特别让我们缅中人民以最大的努力来巩固两国边境人民的友好关系。
    缅中友好万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
