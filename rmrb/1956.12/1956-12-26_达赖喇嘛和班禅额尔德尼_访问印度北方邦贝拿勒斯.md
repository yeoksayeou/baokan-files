Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 25th: The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni visited the Mrigadava (Deer Park) of Sarnath, five miles north of Benares in Uttar Pradesh, India, on the morning of the 23rd. This is where Sakyamuni first preached.

The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama rode on two large elephants from their residence to the Mrigadava. Approximately ten thousand people lined the streets to warmly welcome them, including several thousand Tibetan compatriots. Dressed in robes, they held incense and hadas in their hands, and blew long horns called "dungchen." They had recently come from Tibet to India to pay homage to the relics of Sakyamuni.

Sarnath marks the birthplace of Sakyamuni's religion and is a significant Buddhist activity center. The ancient Chinese monks Faxian and Xuanzang visited this place in the fifth and seventh centuries AD. All the ancient temples are now ruins, and the Mulagandhakuti Vihara is recently built. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama paid homage to the relics of Sakyamuni enshrined there and then unveiled the statue of the founder of the Buddhist Association of India, Dharmapala of Ceylon.

The Buddhist Association of India held a grand reception on the lawn in front of the Mulagandhakuti Vihara on the same morning. Two thousand people sat under tents to listen to the speeches of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.

The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama recounted the history of Sakyamuni's enlightenment and preaching here. They spoke about the teachings of Sakyamuni and pointed out the need to continue strengthening the friendly relations between India and China.

After the reception, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama visited the Dhamek Stupa. The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama offered long prayers here.

Subsequently, they and their entourage sailed on the Ganges River by boat. Several thousand people on the riverbanks, rooftops, and boats greeted them. Some people were beating drums and blowing horns, and some were jumping into the water to perform diving.

On the afternoon of the 23rd, Benares Hindu University held a special gathering to award honorary Doctor of Literature degrees to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. Approximately five thousand university professors, social celebrities, and students attended the gathering.

On the same day, the former Maharaja of Benares, Singh, hosted a luncheon to entertain the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. In the evening, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama and their entourage were dinner guests at Prince Viji's palace. The host enjoys hunting, and his palace is decorated with the skins and heads of tigers he has killed, totaling two hundred.

    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼
    访问印度北方邦贝拿勒斯
    据新华社新德里25日电　达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在23日上午访问了印度北方邦贝拿勒斯以北五英里的鹿野苑的穆耳甘迪柯提寺。这是释迦牟尼第一次讲道的地方。
    达赖和班禅骑着两只大象从他们的住所前往穆耳甘迪柯提寺。约有一万多人排在道路的两旁，向他们表示热烈欢迎，其中有几千个西藏同胞，他们穿着长袍，手中拿着香和哈达，吹着叫做“盾巴”的长喇叭。他们是不久前从西藏来到印度参拜释迦牟尼的遗骨的。
    鹿野苑标志着释迦牟尼宗教的诞生，这是一个巨大的佛教活动中心。中国古代高僧法显和玄奘在西历第五世纪和第七世纪曾经访问过这个地方。古代所有的寺院现在都已经成为废墟，穆耳甘迪柯提寺是最近建造起来的。达赖和班禅参拜了供在那里的释迦牟尼遗骨，接着为印度佛教协会创立人、锡兰的达摩波尔的雕像揭了幕。
    印度佛教协会同一天上午在穆耳甘迪柯提寺前面的草坪上举行了盛大的招待会。有两千人坐在帐篷下面倾听达赖和班禅的讲话。
    达赖和班禅叙述了释迦牟尼在这里悟道和讲经的历史。他们讲述了释迦牟尼的教义，并且指出必须继续加强印中两国的友好关系。
    在举行招待会以后，达赖和班禅参观了大达梅克佛塔。达赖和班禅在这里作了长时间的祈祷。
    随后，他们一行人坐着船在恒河上航行。河岸上、屋顶上和船上有好几千人向他们致意。有些人打着鼓，吹着喇叭，有些人跳入水中作潜水表演。
    23日下午，贝拿勒斯印度教大学举行特别集会，把名誉文学博士学位授给达赖和班禅。大学教授、社会名流和学生共约五千人参加了这个集会。
    同一天，前贝拿勒斯大君辛格曾举行午宴，招待达赖和班禅。晚上，达赖和班禅一行以贵宾身份在维济王子的宫殿进晚餐。主人爱好打猎，他的宫中装饰着他所打到的老虎的皮毛和头，一共有二百只。
