    In an Agricultural Production Cooperative
    —Notes from a Visit to Western Hungary, Part Two
    By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng

    "Eighteen kilometers west of here is Austria." The chairman of the Kangqiqi Agricultural Production Cooperative, Ftelozzi Lajos, said this while showing us around the cooperative he leads, pointing westward. We knew what had recently happened on the Austro-Hungarian border, and we immediately understood the complex content contained in this brief sentence.

    Ftelozzi is a middle-aged man in his forties. We met him yesterday at the meeting of Party activists in Győr. Today, upon seeing us, he repeated what he had said yesterday: "So far, not a single farmer has withdrawn from our production cooperative." Today, this sentence sounded particularly loud and pleasing to the ear.

    The chairman first led us to see the cooperative's livestock operations. Since it is now winter, this part is currently the cooperative's main operating center. Approaching a row of wooden houses, we found the pigsties. Stepping inside, we saw wooden fences of seven or eight feet square, each enclosing groups of pigs of different sizes. The chairman said: "There are currently a total of 594 pigs, large and small, here." Next, we went to see the cowshed. One by one, large and small spotted cows were lying quietly on the wheat straw. The owner pointed to a dairy cow and said, "Her name is Luca, and she can produce 30 liters of milk a day." After visiting the livestock section, the chairman chatted with us. He said: "We can profit 1.8 million forints annually from livestock operations. In agriculture, this year one hold of land (equivalent to 8.5 mu in China) yielded 1,450 kilograms of wheat. Each workday earns a member 52 forints..." These figures are a sign that this cooperative is doing well.

    However, the storm that swept across Hungary also blew dark clouds over the village of Mihalyi, where this cooperative is located. This cooperative, with only eight years of history, was subjected to a severe test by the enemy's attacks.

    Counter-revolutionaries and rich peasants in Mihalyi spread rumors and incited the masses to re-elect the chairman and executive committee of the cooperative. At the same time, these lawless elements, armed with shotguns, detained the cooperative chairman, Ftelozzi, and the Party branch secretary. They wanted to use this to intimidate the masses, preventing them from supporting the current leaders of the cooperative, thereby ruining the cooperative. But their first move failed. Young members of the cooperative went to the rich peasants and said, "The chairman of the cooperative belongs to the cooperative, it has nothing to do with you. Release our chairman immediately." Seeing the members coming on strong, the rich peasants had no choice but to release the chairman. Since this approach did not achieve its purpose, the reactionaries incited the masses to elect a relative of a pig trader as the chairman of the cooperative, even though this person was not a member at all. On October 30, the entire cooperative held a mass meeting to re-elect the leaders of the cooperative. This day saw the largest number of attendees in the history of Mihalyi village. Not only were all the members present, but even old women and children went. Everyone knew who was standing behind the pig trader's relative, and they also knew that this struggle was related to their own families and happiness. The election results again dealt a heavy blow to those reactionaries. Ftelozzi was re-elected as chairman of the cooperative. The second failure did not make the reactionaries give up. They called Ftelozzi again, forcing him to "voluntarily" resign from the chairmanship. Ftelozzi told us personally: "I knew that if I resigned from the chairmanship, it would be easier for the reactionaries to ruin the production cooperative. So, I stubbornly replied: I will never resign." Thus, the first stage of this struggle came to an end. Due to the establishment of the worker-peasant government, the arrogance of the reactionaries temporarily subsided.

    "Why did your cooperative stand the test in this incident?" We asked this question.

    "The first point is that the members of our cooperative all stayed in the cooperative because they did not want to be farm laborers again," the chairman recognized. And a member named Horvath believed that: "Most of the people in our cooperative were poor in the past. Only by participating in the cooperative life has their life improved, so they are unwilling to leave. Now, we strictly adhere to the principle of voluntarism, neither forcing people to join nor forcing them to stay."

    In the cooperative's office, we also met with the members of the Provisional Executive Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party in the cooperative. The re-organization of the Party's work in the cooperative began two weeks ago. So far, nineteen people have been approved as Party members and have elected a Party Provisional Executive Committee composed of two people (one of whom is the cooperative chairman, Ftelozzi). On the day of our visit, two more people submitted applications to join the Party. A member of the Party Executive Committee explained to us that in addition to developing the organization, "the Party's main task now is to support the cooperative and not allow saboteurs to operate within the cooperative. If someone voluntarily withdraws from the cooperative, we will never stop them, but if someone is sabotaging it from within, we will never allow it."

    在一个农业生产合作社里
    ——匈牙利西部访问记之二
    本报记者　胡思升
    “这里往西十八公里就是奥地利。”康其其农业生产合作社主席弗特洛齐·劳尤士陪着我们参观他所领导的合作社，同时用手指着西方说了这句话。我们知道不久前在奥匈边境发生了什么，也就马上懂得这一句简短的话里所包含的全部复杂内容。
    弗特洛齐是个四十多岁的中年人，昨天在吉厄尔城的党积极分子会上我们就认识了他。今天，他见了我们又重复了一遍他昨天说过的话：“到目前为止没有一个农民退出我们这个生产合作社。”这一句话今天听起来似乎特别响亮，特别悦耳。
    主席首先领我们去看合作社经营畜牧业的部分。由于现在是冬季，这一部分就是社内目前主要的经营中心。走近一排木房子，就是猪的栖身之处。走进去一看，七、八尺见方的木栏分别圈着大小不同的猪群。主席说：现在这里大猪小猪一共有五百九十四头。接着我们去看牛栏，一头头大小不同的花牛安静地卧在麦秸上。主人指着一头奶牛说：“她叫路卡，一天可挤三十公升奶。”参观了畜牧业部分后，主席跟我们闲谈起来。他说：“我们经营畜牧业每年可得益一百八十万福林。在农业方面，今年一霍尔德土地（合中国八亩半）收获一千四百五十公斤小麦。社员每一劳动日可得五十二福林……”。这些数字是这个合作社办得好的标志。
    但是，在匈牙利全国发生的风暴把乌云也吹到这个合作社所在地的米哈依村的上空来了。这个只有八年历史的合作社受到了敌人进攻的严峻考验。
    米哈依村的反革命分子和富农们散布空气并煽动群众，要重新选举合作社的主席和执行委员会。同时，这些不法之徒用猎枪作武装，把合作社主席弗特洛齐和党支部书记扣押起来。他们想借此威吓群众，使他们不敢再拥护目前社的领导干部，从而把社搞垮。但是，第一着棋就没有走赢。社内的年青社员跑到富农那里说：“社主席是合作社的，与你们毫不相干，马上把我们的主席放出来。”富农们见社员来势很猛，只得把主席释放了。既然这一手没有达到目的，反动分子便鼓动群众选一个贩猪商人的亲戚当合作社的主席，虽然这个人根本不是社员。10月30日那天，全社开群众大会，重新选举社的领导人员。这一天是米哈依村历史上到会人数最多的一次，不仅社员都到齐了，连老大娘、小孩子都去了。每一个人知道是谁站在贩猪商人亲戚的背后，也知道这场斗争关系到自己的家庭和幸福。选举的结果，又在那些反动分子的头上打了重重的一棒，弗特洛齐仍然当选为合作社主席。第二次的失败并没有使反动分子们甘心。他们又把弗特洛齐叫去，威逼他“自动”辞去主席职务。弗特洛齐亲自对我们说：“我知道，如果我辞去主席职务，反动分子就容易把生产合作社搞垮，于是，我强硬地回答：我决不辞职。”于是，这场斗争的第一阶段就此告一段落。由于工农政府的成立，反动分子的气焰暂时减退了。
    “为什么你们的合作社在这次事件中经得起考验呢？”我们提出了这样的问题。
    “首先一点是，我们社内的社员所以都留在合作社内，是因为他们不愿再当雇农。”主席是这样认识的。而一个叫作霍尔伐特的社员的看法是：“我们社内一大部分人过去都穷，只有参加合作社生活才好起来，所以不愿走开。现在，我们严格地遵守自愿原则，既不强拉，也不强留。”
    在合作社的办公室内，我们又会见了社内的社会主义工人党临时执行委员会的委员们。社内重新组织党的工作是两个星期以前开始的。到目前为止，已有十九个人被批准为党员，并选出了由两个人
  （其中一人就是合作社主席弗特洛齐）组成的党临时执委会。我们去访问的那天，又有两个人提出入党申请。党执行委员会的一个委员向我们说明除了发展组织以外，“党现在主要的任务是支持合作社，不允许破坏分子在合作社内活动。如果有人自愿退社，我们决不阻止，但是如果有人在里面破坏，我们决不允许。”
