Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 15th: In the workers' residential areas of Anshan City, many new-type families have emerged, characterized by mutual respect and love between husband and wife, and unity and mutual assistance among neighbors.

　　Among the 115 worker families living in Dongchangdianpu, 95 have achieved the "Five Goods." Cai Guizhen's husband was transferred to Jilin earlier this year to support basic construction. Once, her child fell ill, and the remittance was not received in time. She wanted to write to her husband and ask him to return. When the neighbors found out, they immediately borrowed money for her from the mutual aid fund, accompanied her to see the doctor with the child, and took care of her housework. After that, whenever Cai Guizhen wrote to her husband, she always told him not to worry about things at home and encouraged him to concentrate on production. Recently, her husband was elected as an advanced producer and received a reward. In the first street of Tiexi District, a worker family group of 26 households had eight women giving birth this year. The mutual aid group took good care of them and took on all the housework, including cooking. Their husbands did not miss a single day of production. Cui Shulian, who used to complain that her husband earned too little and wanted him to cook and take care of the children after work, also made a self-criticism after receiving the "Five Goods" education. Now, she prepares delicious meals for her husband every day and often cares about his production.

　　Many activists in eliminating illiteracy have also emerged among the worker families. Chen Xiuyu has to take care of four children under the age of ten, but she can still guarantee two hours of classes and two hours of self-study every day. In more than five months, she has learned more than 700 characters, and she gets a score of five on every exam. According to recent statistics, nearly 30,000 worker family members in Anshan City have participated in cultural studies.

    新型家庭
    新华社鞍山15日电　在鞍山市的职工住宅区中，出现了很多夫妻互敬互爱、邻居团结互助的新型家庭。
    住在东长甸铺的一百一十五户职工家属，就有九十五户做到了“五好”。才桂珍的丈夫上半年调到吉林去支援基本建设，有一次她的孩子生病，汇款又没有及时收到，她想写信叫丈夫回来。邻居们知道后，连忙到互助基金会中借钱给她，又陪她抱着孩子去看病，替她料理家务。以后才桂珍在每次写信给丈夫的时候，总是叫他不要挂念家里的事，鼓励他安心生产。最近她丈夫当选了先进生产者，受到奖励。铁西区第一街一个二十六户的职工家属小组，今年有八个妇女生孩子，互助小组替她们照料得很好，并且担负了做饭等全部家务事。她们丈夫都没有耽误一天生产。过去嫌丈夫挣钱少要他下班回来做饭带孩子的崔淑莲，受到“五好”教育后也主动作了检讨，现在她每天给她丈夫准备可口的饭菜，还经常关心他的生产情况。
    职工家属中还出现了很多扫除文盲的积极分子。陈秀玉一人要照料四个十岁以下的孩子，但是她每天还能保证两小时上课，两小时自修，五个多月来就认识了七百多字。每次考试都得五分。据最近的统计，鞍山市有近三万个职工家属参加了文化学习。
