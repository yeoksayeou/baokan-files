Shanxi's First Inland Waterway
　　Fen River Xinjiang to Hejin Section Opens

　　(Our Newspaper) News: Shanxi Province's first inland waterway, the Xinjiang to Hejin section of the Fen River, has recently opened to navigation. The Fen River is one of the main rivers in Shanxi Province. The land on both banks is fertile and rich in products. In particular, the counties of Linfen, Xiangfen, Quwo, Xinjiang, Jishan, and Hejin along the lower reaches of the Fen River are rich in grain and cotton, and material exchanges are frequent. However, before the development of river transport, material exchanges mainly relied on railway or highway transport. For a long time, in addition to using the Fen River for irrigation, the masses along the river urgently demanded navigation. In order to realize the wishes of the people, the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee and transportation departments invested 140,000 yuan in 1956, dispatched technicians to survey the river, organized construction, built docks, built ships, and established an agency to specifically manage shipping. After several months of exploration and construction, except for the Linfen to Xiangfen section, which is still under construction, the 170-kilometer waterway from Xiangfen to Hejin has been basically navigable after trial navigation. The Xinjiang to Hejin section has officially opened to navigation recently. (Jun Lun)

　  山西第一条内河航道
　　汾河新绛至河津段开航
    本报讯　山西省第一条内河航道——汾河新绛至河津段最近已开始通航。汾河是山西省境内的主要河流之一，两岸土地肥沃，物产丰富，尤其沿汾河下游的临汾、襄汾、曲沃、新绛、稷山、河津等县盛产粮食和棉花，物资交流频繁。但在开辟河运以前，物资交流主要依靠铁路或公路运输，长期以来，沿岸群众除利用汾水灌溉外，迫切要求通航。山西省人民委员会和交通部门为了实现人民群众的愿望，1956年投资十四万元，并派遣技术人员普查河道，组织施工，修建码头，建造船只，并成立了专管航运的机构，经过几个月来的勘查施工，除临汾至襄汾仍在施工外，襄汾至河津一百七十公里的航道经过试航已基本可以通航，其中新绛至河津段已于最近正式开航。　（俊伦）
