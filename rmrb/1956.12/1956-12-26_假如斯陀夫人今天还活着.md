    "If Harriet Beecher Stowe Were Alive Today..."
    Yao Pingfang
    Recently, I re-read American female writer Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and I felt endless sympathy and indignation towards the fate of those enslaved black people who lost their freedom, and the suffering of those mothers who watched their own children being snatched away as slaves on the auction block. The most unforgettable scene is the novel's depiction of a ship where fashionable white people were comfortably sunbathing on the upper deck, while in the lower steerage, a young black mother, after enduring all kinds of torture under the slavery system, committed suicide by throwing herself into the river, wanting to escape to a "country that would never surrender a fugitive slave even if the entire United States demanded it." When I read this passage, I couldn't help but close the book and think of the recent news reports about the insane persecution of black people in the American South. I thought, if this great humanitarian writer, who died sixty years ago, were still alive in the United States today, she would definitely encounter the following:
    She would be investigated and interrogated by the gentlemen of the House Un-American Activities Committee. They would accuse her of being "disloyal" to the United States, a Communist or a sympathizer with Communism, because she used her pen to powerfully expose the countless crimes committed by certain groups in the United States against black people, and she "slandered" the American "free" system.
    She would receive threatening letters from the American Ku Klux Klan, accompanied by a black person's head and a bullet, and a large cross would be burned in front of her door, demanding that she destroy all her works and "atone" to the Ku Klux Klan, or else face a pistol. Mrs. Stowe had experienced this before. During her lifetime, she had received such a package containing a bloody ear cut from a black person's head. Today, the American Ku Klux Klan are the direct disciples of the person who sent that package, and they would definitely do it even more fiercely and cruelly than their master.
    The American government would use various methods to prohibit the serialization of her "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in newspapers and magazines. She would request to go abroad, but the State Department would not issue her a passport, just like they treat the black singer Paul Robeson today. Mrs. Stowe suffered the same hardship during her lifetime: at that time, the pro-slavery government under the fourteenth President of the United States, Pierce, instructed the American ambassador to England, Buchanan, to try to prevent Queen Victoria of England from receiving her. Today, the American government, which has inherited President Pierce's mantle, would hardly treat this great writer any more politely, would it?
    Fortunately, Mrs. Stowe passed away long ago, sparing her the harassment of the Un-American Activities Committee and Hoover's FBI agents. However, who can guarantee that her immortal works will not be included in the blacklist of "subversive books," removed from libraries across the United States, and destroyed?
    The slavery system that Mrs. Stowe fought against all her life is being revived in the United States today in a disguised form, and it is even more intensified. Therefore, Mrs. Stowe's call is still so loud: "I hope that every woman who can write (no, every upright American) will not remain silent!"

    “假如斯陀夫人今天还活着……”
    姚平芳
    最近重读了美国女作家哈丽哀特·比辙·斯陀的“黑奴吁天录”，对那些失去了自由的被奴役的黑人的命运，对那些眼看亲生的儿女在拍卖台上被人夺去为奴的母亲们的苦痛，感到无限的同情和悲愤。而最难忘的图景，是小说描写到在一艘船上，上层甲板时髦的白人在舒适地晒太阳，而在下层统舱里，一个年轻的黑人母亲在历尽奴隶制度的各种折磨以后，投河自杀，想逃到一个“即使全美国要求也决不交出一个逃亡的黑奴的国家去”。当我读到这个片断的时候，我不由得合起书本，想起近来许多关于美国南部的疯狂迫害黑人的新闻报道。我想，假如这位死去了六十年的伟大的人道主义的作家，今天还在美国活着，她一定会有这样的遭遇：
    她会受到国会非美活动调查委员会的老爷们的调查和侦讯。他们会控告她对美国“不忠诚”，是共产党人或共产主义的同情者，因为她以自己的笔有力地揭露了美国的某些集团对黑人犯下了的擢发难数的罪行，她“诽谤”了美国的“自由”制度。
    她会收到美国三K党徒的附有一个黑人的头颅和一颗子弹的恐吓信，并且在她的门前燃烧起大十字架，要她将全部的著作毁版，并向三K党“赎罪”，否则以手枪对付。斯陀夫人对这一点是有过经验的，在她活着的时候，她曾接到过一个这样的包裹，里面装着一个从黑人头上割下来的血淋淋的耳朵。今天美国三K党人是那个寄包裹的人的嫡传弟子，他们一定会比他们的师傅干得更凶更狠。
    美国政府会用各种方法禁止她的“黑奴吁天录”在报刊上连载。她要求到国外去，但国务院不发给她护照，像今天对待黑人歌王保罗·罗伯逊一样。斯陀夫人在生前曾吃过同样的苦头：当时美国第十四届总统庇尔斯任内的那个赞成奴隶制的政府，曾指使美国驻英大使布卡南设法阻止英国维多利亚女皇接见她。今天继承了庇尔斯总统衣钵的美国政府，难道会更客气地对待这位伟大的作家吗？
    幸而斯陀夫人早已去世，她免去了非美活动调查委员会和胡佛的联邦调查局的特务们的烦扰。但是，谁能担保她的不朽的著作不会列入“颠复性书籍”的黑名单内，从美国各地的图书馆中清理出来，加以销毁呢？
    斯陀夫人生前与之战斗了一辈子的奴隶制度，正在今天美国变相地复活，而且变本加厉。因此，斯陀夫人的呼吁还是这样的响亮：“我希望每一个能动笔写文章的妇女（不，每一个正直的美国人）不要再沉默下去！”
