    He said that we have brought to the Soviet people the deep and sincere friendship of the Chinese people, and at the same time, we will bring back to the Chinese people the sincere friendship of the Soviet people from you. After returning home, we will tell our people everything we have seen and heard in the Soviet Union. Finally, Peng Zhen warmly thanked the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people for their warm hospitality to the delegation, and expressed a warm welcome to the delegation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to visit China in the near future.
