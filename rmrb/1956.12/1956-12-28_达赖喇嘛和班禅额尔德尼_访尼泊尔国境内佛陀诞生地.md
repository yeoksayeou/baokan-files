Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 27th: The Dalai Lama, Panchen Erdeni, and their entourage visited Lumbini, the Buddhist holy site and birthplace of Buddha, on the 26th. They devoutly offered a long prayer under the Bodhi tree in front of the temple.

Lumbini is within the borders of Nepal, twenty-one miles from Nogar, a small town in Uttar Pradesh, India. When the Dalai Lama and Panchen arrived in Lumbini, they were welcomed by Gurung, the administrative head of the Balawa district of Nepal, and Prakash Man Singh, the director of protocol of the Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Dalai Lama and Panchen reviewed the guard of honor. Thousands of Nepalese villagers and pilgrims from Tibet, China, cheered to welcome them.

When they returned to Nogar, the local authorities held a reception for them. Three hundred people attended the reception, and thousands more stood nearby. The chairman and the administrative head of the Basti County Committee delivered enthusiastic welcoming speeches at the reception. In his speech, the Dalai Lama recounted the life of Buddha. He called on Buddhists to practice the teachings of Buddha. He said: "Today, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are an irrepressible force in our world, and these five principles are consistent with the teachings of Buddha. Therefore, followers of Buddha must uphold these five principles to strive for world peace."

Panchen said he was very happy to be able to visit the birthplace of Buddha and he prayed for an end to all disasters and for the happiness of all living beings. He appealed to all Buddhists to "work to promote Buddhism, stop wars, and eliminate destructive weapons." He added: "You must abide by the Five Principles and work for the revival of Buddhism and world peace."

The Dalai Lama and Panchen arrived in Nogar from Gorakhpur on the morning of the 26th, and they went to another holy site, Gaya, in the evening.

    访尼泊尔国境内佛陀诞生地
    据新华社新德里27日电　达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼和他们的随行人员26日参观了佛教圣地、佛陀诞生地——蓝毗尼。他们在庙前的天竺菩提树下虔诚地作了长时间的祝祷。
    蓝毗尼是在尼泊尔的国境之内，离印度北方邦的一个小镇诺加尔二十一英里。当达赖和班禅到达蓝毗尼的时候，他们受到尼泊尔巴拉瓦区行政长官古隆和尼泊尔外交部礼宾司司长普腊卡斯·曼·辛格的欢迎。达赖和班禅检阅了仪仗队。数千名尼泊尔村民和来自中国西藏的香客向他们欢呼表示欢迎。
    当他们回到诺加尔时，地方当局为他们举行了招待会。有三百个人参加了招待会，还有数以千计的人在附近站着。巴斯蒂县委员会主席和行政长官在招待会上致热烈的欢迎词。达赖在讲话中叙述了佛陀的生平。他吁请佛教徒实行佛陀的教义。他说：“在今天，和平共处的五项原则在我们的世界上已是不能压制的了，这五项原则和佛陀的教义也是一致的。因此，佛陀的信徒们必须维护这五项原则来为世界和平努力。”
    班禅说，他很高兴能够访问佛陀的诞生地，他祝祷终止一切灾难，祝祷生灵幸福。他向一切佛教徒呼吁，要他们“为宣扬佛法、制止战争和消灭毁灭性的武器而努力。”他又说：“你们必须遵守五项原则，并且为佛法的复活和世界和平而努力。”
    达赖和班禅26日早上从哥拉克浦尔到达诺加尔，他们在晚上前往另一圣地伽耶。
