Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 1st. Hunan Province's poultry industry has seen great development. According to statistics from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, the production of chickens, geese, and ducks has reached more than 45.8 million, an increase of about 40% compared to the end of last year. Among them, duck production has almost doubled, with about 12 million ducklings hatched. The ducks hatched in the spring now weigh one or two *jin* each. To support poultry production, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and the People's Bank have allocated more than 5.61 million *jin* of feed grain and over 20,000 yuan in loans.

Hunan has a mild climate and numerous lakes, rivers, and streams, making it suitable for developing the poultry industry. In the Dongting Lake Plain, many specialized duck-raising cooperatives have been organized. Agricultural cooperatives throughout the province raise chickens, ducks, and other poultry in almost every household.

    ·湖南省·
    大量喂养鸡鸭鹅
    新华社长沙1日电　湖南省家禽业有很大发展。据省农业厅统计，鸡、鹅、鸭三种家禽的生产已达到四千五百八十多万只，比去年底增加了40％左右。其中鸭增加将近一倍，孵出的小鸭约一千二百万只，春天孵出的鸭，现在每只已有一、二斤重了。为了扶植家禽生产，省农业厅和人民银行曾配发饲料粮五百六十一万多斤，贷款二万余元。
    湖南气候温和，湖河港汊繁多，适宜于发展家禽业，在洞庭湖滨平原上，还组织了许多专业的鸭民合作社。各地农业社几乎家家饲养鸡鸭等家禽。
