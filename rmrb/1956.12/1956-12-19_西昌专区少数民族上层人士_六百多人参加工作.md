Xinhua News Agency, December 18th. In Xichang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, where Han and various ethnic minorities live together, 628 progressive upper-class members of ethnic minorities have now taken up work. These upper-class individuals include the Yi, Tibetan, Mongol, Hui, Miao, and Lisu ethnic groups and are working in political and legal, cultural and educational, and financial and economic positions. Among them, 47 serve as county heads, deputy county heads, vice chairmen of the CPPCC, or hold positions equivalent to the county level.

These upper-class figures actively support democratic reform. During the reform process in various counties, more than 300 upper-class figures were invited to form 41 inspection groups to conduct inspections in reform areas, which played a certain role in promoting the smooth progress of the reform work. The inspection group organized by Huili County to go to Maomao Township, after the inspection, put forward some correct suggestions for the reform work in this township. The People's Government adopted these suggestions and overcame some shortcomings in the work. Some upper-class figures also actively promoted the policy of peaceful reform to their relatives and family members. Some even braved wind and snow, carrying dry food, to persuade those who had concerns about democratic reform in the deep mountains and old forests.

    西昌专区少数民族上层人士
    六百多人参加工作
    新华社18日讯　在汉族和各少数民族杂居的四川省西昌专区，目前已经有六百二十八名进步的少数民族上层人士参加了工作。这些上层人士包括彝、藏、蒙、回、苗、傈僳等民族，分布在政法、文教、财经等岗位上工作。他们当中担任县长、副县长、政协副主席或相当于县级职务的有四十七人。
    这些上层人士都积极赞助民主改革。各县在改革过程中，曾经邀集三百多个上层人士，组成四十一个视察组，到改革地区进行视察，对改革工作的顺利进行起了一定的推动作用。会理县组织到猫猫乡去的视察组，视察后对这个乡的改革工作提出了一些正确的建议，人民政府都加以采纳，克服了工作中的一些缺点。有的上层人士，还积极向亲友和家人宣传和平改革的政策。有的甚至不顾风雪，背起干粮，到深山老林去说服对民主改革有顾虑的人。
