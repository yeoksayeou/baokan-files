    Readers' Letters
　　Don't Let Us Be Empty-Handed Anymore
    We are students in the Chinese Department, and classical literature is one of our major courses. Our teacher instructs us that to study classical literature well, it is not enough to just listen in class; we must also think and study independently. Reference books are powerful assistants for our self-study. Common and easily accessible ones include "Ci Hai" and "Ci Yuan" for looking up characters, words, and allusions, "Ci Tong" and "Lianmian Dictionary" for looking up disyllabic words, "Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Names" for looking up people's names, "Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Chinese Place Names" for looking up place names...
    Going to the library to borrow these common and easily accessible reference books, there are many people but limited books, making it difficult to borrow them.
    Going to old bookstores to buy these common and easily accessible reference books, these kinds of books are rarely available on the market. Even if there are a few, they are quickly snapped up by those "who are near the water and get the moon first," and it is impossible for us to get them. Not to mention buying these books, even buying a copy of the "Book of Songs," one classmate had to run to the old bookstore twice. From this, one can see the general situation.
    We have the enthusiasm for learning and the determination to conquer the fortress of science, but everyone knows that enthusiasm and determination alone are not enough. We must also have good learning methods and conditions. What we lack now is not something else, but the most necessary reference books to complete our work. We suggest that relevant departments organize manpower and resources to re-edit and publish these urgently needed reference books. Don't let us be empty-handed anymore. Wang Xiang
    Don't Occupy the Sports Field
    The cadres of Ping順 (Píngshùn) County, Shanxi Province, once used their holidays to carry out voluntary labor and build a very simple basketball court. Although we only spend a short time here every day, everyone is very happy. However, in August, this court was used as a temporary construction site. In late October, the County Sports Commission rebuilt a basketball court, but unexpectedly, just a week later, it was occupied by the Cultural Center for an exhibition, which will last for about two or three months. We have raised objections to the relevant parties, but no one has paid attention. We once again make a request, please do not occupy our sports field.

　　别让我们再赤手空拳了
    我们是中文系的学生，古典文学是我们的专业课之一。老师指导我们，要学好古典文学，只靠课堂听讲是不够的，还必须自己独立思考钻研。工具书是我们自学的有力助手。常见易得的有查字、词、典故等的“辞海”“辞源”，查联绵字的
  “辞通”、“联绵字典”等，查人名的“中国人名大辞典”，查地名的
  “中国古今地名大辞典”……
    到图书馆去借这些常见易得的工具书，人多书有限，很难借到手。
    到古旧书店去买这些常见易得的工具书，这类书很少登市，偶有几部，也早让“近水楼台先得月”者抢购去了，根本轮不到我们的名下。莫说买这些书，就连买一本“诗经”，有一位同学还跑了两趟古旧书店哩，由此更可见一般了。
    我们有学习的热情，有攻下科学堡垒的决心，但是，谁都知道，光有热情和决心是不够的，还必须有良好的学习方法和条件。我们现在所缺少的不是别的，就是缺少完成工作所最必须的工具书。建议有关部门能组织人力物力，重新补订出版这些急需的工具书。别让我们再赤手空拳了。　王　祥
    不要占去运动场
    山西平顺县的机关干部曾经利用假日，进行义务劳动，修建了一个设备非常简陋的篮球场。虽然我们每天在这里活动的时间很短，但大家很高兴。可是，8月间，这个球场被用作临时工地了。10月下旬，县体育运动委员会又重建了一个篮球场，不料刚过了一个星期，又被文化馆举办展览会占去了，时间大约要二、三个月。我们曾向有关方面提意见，但无人理会。我们再一次提出要求，请不要占去我们的运动场。
