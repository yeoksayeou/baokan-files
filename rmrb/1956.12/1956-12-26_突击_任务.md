    "Blitz" Task
    Zhang Zhimin
    What's keeping the township instructor so busy?
    Tiring him out until he's sweating all over.
    Calling a meeting of cadres in the middle of the night,
    Rousing the head of the commune, committee members… a whole string of them:
    Some are dozing;
    Some are rubbing their eyes;
    Some are like startled birds,
    Shivering all over…
    The instructor stands before the oil lamp,
    Wiping sweat as he shouts:
    "Comrade Cadres!
    Quickly go back and 'mobilize,'
    Men and women, old and young, full and part-time laborers,
    Get them up and working tonight!
    The wheat fields by the village,
    Must all be watered;
    Saplings along the road,
    Must be planted every ten steps…
    The task is extremely urgent,
    Must be completed before dawn!"
    Someone asks: "So much wheat field,
    How can we irrigate it all thoroughly in a short time?"
    Someone says: "Planting trees like this,
    There's no guarantee they'll survive!"
    The instructor's face is dripping with sweat:
    "Any opinions can be raised later,
    There's no time to discuss now.
    Whether they live or not, whether it's thorough or not,
    Let's not worry about that for now,
    You must know, a visiting delegation is coming tomorrow!"

    “突击”任务
    张志民
    什么事忙坏了乡指导员？
    累得他满头冒大汗。
    半夜里来召集干部会，
    赶起了社长，委员……一大串：
    有的在瞌睡；
    有的在揉眼；
    有的像是惊弓鸟，
    混身一直打冷战……
    指导员站在油灯前，
    一边擦汗一边喊：
    “干部同志们！
    赶快回去作‘动员’，
    男女老少、整半劳力，
    连夜起来干！
    村边的麦地，
    通通要浇过一遍水；
    路旁的树秧，
    十步一棵要栽全……
    任务十分紧，
    完成要在天明前！”
    有人问：“那么多麦地，
    一会儿怎么能浇透？”
    有人说：“这样儿栽树，
    活不活可不保险！”
    指导员脸上流着汗：
    “有什么意见以后提，
    现在讨论没时间。
    活不活、透不透，
    咱先别管，
    要知道，明天要来参观团！”
