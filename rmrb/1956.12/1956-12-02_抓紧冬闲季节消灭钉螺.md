　　Seize the Slack Winter Season to Eliminate Snails
　　Commentator of this newspaper
    Winter is the best season to massively carry out the elimination of the intermediate host of schistosomiasis - the snails. At this time, on the one hand, the irrigation ditches and marsh areas where snails breed have become dry and the grass has withered, making it easy to bury them with soil, reclaim the land, and burn them; on the other hand, winter is an agricultural off-season, so the large amount of labor required to eliminate snails using the above methods can be solved without affecting production. All regions should seize this favorable opportunity, widely organize and mobilize the masses, and carry out winter snail eradication work on the basis of fully preparing technically.
    The method of burying snails with soil is suitable for irrigation ditches and rivers in plains and mountainous areas. Over the past year, this method has been widely used in various regions. There are two main methods of burying with soil: one is to remove the soil layer with snails on both sides of the irrigation ditch and river channel, dig a pit to bury it deeply, compact it, and suffocate the snails; the other method is to fill the old ditch and open a new ditch, fill the irrigation ditch with snails and plant crops, and open a new irrigation ditch to replace the old ditch, so that all the snails in the old ditch will die. According to the practice of various regions, the disadvantage of the former method is that it is not thorough. The effect of one-time removal of grass and soil burial only kills about 80% of the snails, and then the snail density gradually increases again, and even after repeated removal of grass and soil burial, residual snails are still found and cannot be eradicated. As a result, after multiple soil burials, the irrigation ditch becomes wider and wider, encroaching on cultivated land and consuming a lot of labor, which affects the enthusiasm of farmers. The latter method of snail eradication can achieve a once-and-for-all effect and should be vigorously promoted. The widespread application of the method of filling old ditches and opening new ditches to eliminate snails must be combined with the comprehensive adjustment of the water conservancy irrigation system, that is, on the basis of overall planning, all new ditches should be opened to replace old ditches. This can reduce the original irrigation ditches, expand the cultivated area, and make all the snails die; it can also make the irrigation system more reasonable and applicable through overall planning. At the same time, the new ditch has fewer bends, faster water flow, no weeds, and is not conducive to the survival of snails. Therefore, agriculture, water conservancy and other relevant departments should vigorously implement this effective measure that is both conducive to production and conducive to eliminating schistosomiasis. When implementing it, it should be done from upstream to downstream to prevent snails from being washed into the newly opened ditches. As for the method of removing the surface soil layer with snails from the irrigation ditch, it is still applicable to areas where it is temporarily impossible to fill old ditches and open new ditches or where it is impossible to fill old ditches and open new ditches due to geographical restrictions. However, when there are still residual snails after several soil burials, chemical snail eradication can be combined in appropriate seasons. There is no need to repeat soil burial due to the remaining few snails, which consumes a lot of labor.
    Eliminating snails in marsh areas has always been considered relatively difficult. However, after several years of on-site observation and research, some effective experiences have been created. The first experience is embankment reclamation. For example, the Yanglinzhai State-owned Farm in Dongting Lake, Hunan Province, was originally a barren island that was submerged by water every summer, and exposed above the water in winter, making it very suitable for snails to breed and multiply. However, since the opening of the state-owned farm for embankment reclamation, snails have gradually died. The second experience is reclamation without enclosure. In some larger areas of barren islands, considering the need for flood storage or insufficient strength to build embankments, single reclamation and planting without enclosure can be carried out. For example, in the Guangxingzhou area of Dongting Lake in Hunan, the Yueyang County Party Committee mobilized four senior agricultural cooperatives nearby to carry out reclamation this year. After inspection, snails have mostly died in the reclaimed areas. For example, Shibi Lake in Yiyang County, Hunan Province, is a vast ocean every summer, and a piece of land appears in autumn. Although it is submerged by water every year, there are no snails in the places where winter crops have been reclaimed and planted, and the snail density is very high in the unreclaimed places. Therefore, the method of single reclamation and planting without enclosure can also achieve the effect of snail eradication. Because snails are amphibians, their survival conditions must have grass and water. They like to live on land in cold weather and in water in hot weather. According to this law, if the above measures are taken to remove the grass and water on which they depend for survival and change the suitable environment on which they depend for survival, and put them under dry and sunny exposure, the snails will not be able to survive and die. Therefore, agriculture, water conservancy, health and other relevant departments should formulate specific plans based on existing experience, seize the winter agricultural off-season, organize the necessary manpower and material resources, and gradually eliminate snails in the vast marsh areas.
    The effect of burning snails with fire is also good. This method is mostly used in marsh areas, but the specific burning methods vary from place to place. In the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province, because the lake grass is tall and dense, it is not necessary to cut down the lake grass. After igniting it, more than 90% of the snails can be burned to death; in the Zhenjiang area of Jiangsu Province, on the reed beach, only two or three kilograms of dry firewood per square meter on average are needed to burn 92%-96% of the snails to death; according to the experiment in Yishan County, Guangxi Province, in mountainous areas with a lot of grass, the use of fire can also burn more than 80% of the snails to death at a time. As for whether to cut down weeds when burning and how much grass is used per square meter, it must be determined according to the specific local conditions (the type of grass, whether the ground is dry, whether the wind direction is suitable, etc. are all related). When using this method in specific locations, key experiments should be carried out first to obtain experience before popularizing it.
    In order to better carry out snail eradication work, schistosomiasis prevention and control institutions at all levels should accurately grasp the distribution areas, area, density, etc. of snails through investigation. Over the past year, various regions have basically attached importance to this work. However, some regions have not paid enough attention to this work, have not grasped it tightly, and have not conducted investigations with leadership and deployment from top to bottom, so they have not been able to fully grasp the distribution of snails in their local areas. All regions should organize sufficient forces to complete the snail survey task within a certain period of time, and then formulate systematic snail eradication plans based on this, determine the snail eradication methods and steps for various types of regions, and carry out snail eradication work with leadership and planning. Because the distribution area of snails is extremely wide, the steps of snail eradication should first eliminate snails in areas near residential areas, and then eliminate snails in areas farther away from residential areas with less danger, so that the snail eradication work can achieve twice the result with half the effort.
    To carry out winter snail eradication work, technical preparations must be fully made. In this year's spring snail eradication work, due to insufficient understanding of the importance of technical guidance in advance and insufficient and thorough publicity and education, the snail eradication work in many areas did not meet the specifications and requirements, the snail eradication effect was very poor, resulting in rework and make-up lessons, wasting manpower and material resources, and even some people were infected with schistosomiasis because they went into the water barefoot to operate. These deviations should be resolutely prevented in this winter's snail eradication work. In order to do a good job in technical preparation, publicity and education should be carried out in depth and meticulously among the masses, and the training of health workers in cooperatives should be done well, so that the masses understand the significance of eliminating snails and the actual operation methods. At the same time, the method of typical demonstration can be adopted to educate the masses, first make a model, organize the masses to visit and learn, and then fully promote it. In the snail eradication work, forces should also be organized to conduct technical guidance on a tour basis, and deviations should be corrected in time when they are found.

　　抓紧冬闲季节消灭钉螺
　　本报评论员
    冬季是大规模开展消灭血吸虫病的中间宿主—钉螺的最好季节。这时候，一方面孳生钉螺的灌溉沟及湖沼地区已变得水干草枯，便于土埋、开垦与火烧；另方面，冬天是一个农闲季节，对于采用上述办法灭螺所需要的大量劳动力问题能够解决，不致于影响生产。各地应当抓紧这个有利时机，广泛组织动员群众，在充分做好技术准备的基础上，开展冬季灭螺工作。
    土埋灭螺方法，适用于平原区和山区的灌溉沟渠及河流。一年来，各地已广泛应用了这一方法。土埋的方法主要有两种，一种是铲除灌溉沟及河道两边有钉螺的土层，将其挖坑深埋打实而闷死钉螺；另一方法是填老沟开新沟，将有钉螺的灌溉沟填平种上庄稼，另开一条新的灌溉沟以代替老沟，这样就能使老沟里的钉螺全部死亡。根据各地实践证明，前一种方法的缺点是不彻底，一次铲草土埋的效果，钉螺只死亡80％左右，而后钉螺密度又逐渐升高，甚至连续多次铲草土埋仍发现有残余钉螺而不能根绝，以致经过多次土埋以后，灌溉沟越铲越宽，侵占了耕地面积，消耗了大量的劳动力，影响了农民的积极性。而后一种灭螺方法可以收到一劳永逸的效果，应当大力推广。广泛应用填老沟开新沟的方法灭螺，必须结合全面调整水利灌溉系统来进行，即在全面规划的基础上，全部开新沟代替老沟，这样既可以减少原有灌溉沟渠，扩大耕种面积，并使钉螺全都死亡；又可以通过全面规划，使灌溉系统更加合理、更加适用。同时，由于新开沟的弯度少、水流快、无杂草而不利钉螺的生存。因此，农业、水利等有关部门应当大力贯彻执行这一既有利于生产，又有利于消灭血吸虫病的有效措施。而在实行时，应当先上游后下游，以防止钉螺被冲入新开的沟渠。至于铲除灌溉沟有钉螺的表面土层的办法，对于暂时不能填老沟开新沟或因为地理条件限制而不可能填老沟开新沟的地区，仍然是适用的。但在经过几次土埋仍有残余螺时，可选择适当季节结合以化学药物灭螺，不必因剩下少数钉螺而重复土埋，消耗大量的劳动力。
    消灭湖沼地区的钉螺，一向被认为是比较困难的。但是经过几年来的现场观察研究，已经创造出了一些行之有效的经验。第一条经验是围堤开垦。例如湖南省洞庭湖的杨林寨国营农场，原是一片荒洲，每年夏天被水淹没，冬天则露出水面极适宜钉螺的孳生繁殖。但自从开辟国营农场围堤垦植以后，钉螺即逐渐死亡。第二条经验是垦而不围。在一些较大面积的荒洲，因为考虑到蓄洪的需要或力量不足而不能围堤者，可以单垦植而不用围堤。例如湖南洞庭湖广兴洲地区，今年岳阳县委发动附近四个高级农业合作社进行垦植，在已垦植的地区，经过检查，钉螺已经大部死亡。再如，湖南省益阳县的石碧湖，每年夏季一片汪洋，秋季则现出一片陆地，尽管年年被水淹没，在已开垦种植冬季作物的地方已无钉螺存在，而在未垦植的地方，钉螺密度很高。因此，单垦植而不围堤的办法也能收到灭螺效果。因为钉螺是两栖动物，它的生存条件，必须要有草和水，冷天喜居陆地，热天喜居水中，根据这一规律，如果采取上述措施，除掉它赖以生存的草和水，改变它赖以生存的适宜环境，而置于干燥和阳光的暴晒之下，钉螺便不能生存而死亡。因此，农业、水利、卫生等有关部门应当根据已有的经验，制定具体规划，抓紧冬季农闲季节，组织必要的人力物力，逐步消灭广大湖沼地区的钉螺。
    火烧灭螺的效果也较好。这个办法多在湖沼地区采用，但具体烧法各地不一。在湖南省的洞庭湖地区，因为湖草又高又密，不用砍倒湖草，点火烧后，可以烧死90％以上的钉螺；江苏省镇江地区，在芦滩上，将草砍倒后，平均每平方公尺只需两三斤干柴，即能烧死92％—96％的钉螺；据广西省宜山县试验，在山区草多的地区，采用火烧办法，一次也能烧死80％以上的钉螺。至于火烧时，将野草砍倒与否和每平方公尺用草量多少，须根据当地具体情况而定（草的种类、地面是否干燥、风向是否合适等都有关系），各地在具体运用这一办法时，应先重点试验取得经验后，再加以推广。
    为了更好地开展灭螺工作，各级防治血吸虫病机构应当通过调查，确切掌握钉螺的分布地区、面积、密度，等等。一年以来，各地基本上是重视这一工作的。但也有些地区对这项工作还重视不够，抓的不紧，未能自上而下有领导有布置的调查，因而未能全面掌握本地钉螺的分布情况。各地应当组织足够力量，在一定期限内，完成钉螺的调查任务，然后据以制定系统的灭螺规划，确定各种不同类型地区的灭螺方法及步骤，有领导有计划地开展灭螺工作。因为钉螺的分布面积极广，消灭钉螺的步骤，应当首先消灭居民区附近地区的钉螺，而后消灭离居民区较远而危险性较小的地区的钉螺，使灭螺工作能收事半功倍的效果。
    开展冬季灭螺工作，必须充分做好技术准备。在今年春季灭螺工作中，由于事先对技术指导的重要性认识不足，宣传教育不深不透，曾有不少地区的灭螺工作不合规格要求，灭螺效果很差，造成返工补课，浪费了人力物力，甚至有的群众因为赤脚下水操作而感染了血吸虫病，这些偏差在今冬灭螺工作中应当坚决防止。为了做好技术准备工作，应当深入细致地在群众中开展宣传教育，做好合作社保健员的训练工作，使群众了解消灭钉螺的意义及实际操作方法。同时，可以采取典型示范的方法教育群众，先做出样子，组织群众参观学习，然后全面推广。在灭螺工作中，还应当组织力量巡回进行技术指导，发现偏差即及时纠正。
