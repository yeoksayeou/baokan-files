Xinhua News Agency, "People's Railway Daily," December 6th: From 1953 to the end of November this year, a total of 4,104 kilometers of new railway trunk and branch lines have been paved across the country, exceeding the first Five-Year Plan's target of 4,084 kilometers by 20 kilometers.

Since the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, China has started construction on approximately 30 new railways. Among them, major trunk lines such as the Ji-Er (Jining-Erlian), Feng-Sha (Fengtai-Shacheng), Li-Zhan (Litang-Zhanjiang), and Lan-Yan (Lancun-Yantai) railways have been completed and handed over to the state for operation.

The Lanxin Railway was originally scheduled to be built to Baiyang River (near Yumen) in Gansu in 1957, but the track was laid to Yumen in June this year. The Lanzhou to Wuwei section has been handed over to the state for use, and the Wuwei to Yumen section has also opened for temporary operation. As of the end of November this year, the track-laying project for this railway had passed Yumen by more than 170 kilometers, reaching 963 kilometers. To date, over 40% of the track-laying for the entire line has been completed, and it is continuing to advance westward.

The Yingxia Railway was originally scheduled to be built to Yong'an, Fujian Province, within five years, totaling 443 kilometers. As of the end of November this year, the track-laying had passed Jiaomei Station, leaving only thirty-odd kilometers to the terminus in Xiamen.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway was connected ahead of schedule on July 13th this year. The Chengdu to Guangyuan section has been handed over to the state for use, and the Guangyuan to Yangping section has also opened for temporary operation. North of Yangping, efforts are currently focused on completing the finishing work and operational facilities.

The Baotou-Lanzhou Railway is currently being built from both the north and south ends. By the end of November this year, construction had been underway on 360 kilometers, and approximately 100 kilometers of track had been laid.

Due to the early completion of the original new railway plan, the state has started construction on nine new lines, including the Neijiang-Kunming and Sichuan-Guizhou railways, ahead of schedule from the fourth year of the first Five-Year Plan, which were originally planned to be built in the second Five-Year Plan.

During the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, the vast number of workers, railway soldiers, and engineering and technical personnel participating in the construction of new lines, under the enthusiastic guidance and assistance of Soviet experts, brought into play a high degree of initiative and creativity, thus rapidly completing the state's plan for building new railways and accumulating rich experience in road construction. This provides a more powerful guarantee for striving to overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan and actively preparing for the construction of new railway lines in the second Five-Year Plan.

In the first three years and eleven months of the first Five-Year Plan, an average of more than 1,000 kilometers of track was laid each year, an increase of approximately 13% compared to the original planned average of track-laying per year.

Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, December 7th: At 4:30 this afternoon, the Yingxia Railway track-laying troops laid the rails across Xinglin Port and the Xiamen Strait, reaching Gaqi Village at the southern end of Xiamen Island.

At 6:00 AM, when the officers and soldiers of the track-laying unit and the civilian workers had prepared everything and were about to lay the rails from Xinglin Village, Tongan County, at the western end of the Jimei Seawall towards Xiamen, the person in charge of the engineering headquarters and the representatives of the civilian workers, who had just completed the construction of the seawall, immediately presented flowers to the officers and soldiers of the track-laying unit and the civilian workers. Huang Pei, a soldier of the track-laying unit known as the "track-pulling expert," and his comrades, after receiving the flowers and paying tribute to the seawall builders, immediately pulled down the first pair of rails from the flatcar and laid them on the roadbed on the right side of the seawall. Then, amid the rumbling of artillery fire from the Jinmen direction and the cheers of the seawall workers, teachers and students of various schools in Jimei, and residents of Xiamen City, the officers and soldiers of the track-laying unit and the civilian workers laid the rails from the 5,032-meter-long Jimei Seawall and Xiamen Seawall to Xiamen Island at an average speed of more than 690 meters per hour.

At 11:50 AM, the track-laying unit laid the rails across the Jimei Seawall and reached Jimei Town within Xiamen, amid the alarm of an incoming attack by Chiang Kai-shek's planes. After the alarm was lifted, more than 4,000 seawall employees, teachers and students from various schools in Jimei, and residents of Xiamen City solemnly held a welcoming meeting to celebrate the track-laying to Xiamen and the completion of the Jimei Seawall. Li Wenling, Standing Committee Member of the Xiamen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Acting Mayor of Xiamen City, Ding Defeng, Director of the Seawall Engineering Headquarters, and Colonel Jia Qingxiang, representative of the track-laying unit, all spoke at the meeting, congratulating each other on the victory of track-laying to Xiamen and the Jimei Seawall.

The seawall employees, people from all walks of life in Jimei Town, and teachers and students from Jimei School and Jimei Overseas Chinese Supplementary School presented silk banners and various local products to the officers and soldiers of the track-laying unit and the civilian workers. The officers and soldiers of the track-laying unit and the civilian workers also presented silk banners to the seawall employees.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 7th: The last rail of the Baotou to Baiyun'ebo Iron Mine Railway, which is more than 150 kilometers long, was nailed to the sleepers of the Baiyun'ebo Station track on the 4th of this month. To date, the track-laying project of the Baibao Railway has been completed 27 days ahead of the original plan.

This railway stretches forward along the foot of the Ula Mountains, passing through high mountains, deep valleys, and hills, and climbing over a plateau 1,500 meters above sea level. Its entire roadbed earth and stone works have 5.5 million cubic meters. Road-building workers built 53 small and medium-sized bridges, 120 culverts and arch culverts, and two larger tunnels in the cliffs and steep walls.

In the process of building this railway, railway workers adopted many advanced experiences and saved a lot of funds. For example, in the large blasting construction of the 21-kilometer trench project, in order to overcome the difficulty of lacking yellow explosives, the workers broke the precedent and used black explosives, saving the country 1,700 yuan. In all bridge and culvert main projects and foundation concrete projects, 654 tons of cement were saved due to the use of methods such as the stone chip grouting method.

After this railway is opened to traffic, the ore from the Baiyun'ebo Iron Mine and the coal from the Yingpanliang Coal Mine will be continuously transported out.

    四年之内铺轨四千多公里
　　新建铁路五年计划提前完成
    鹰厦铁路已经铺轨到厦门岛
    本报讯　据“人民铁道报”6日报道：从1953年起到今年11月底，全国新建的铁路干线和支线共铺轨四千一百零四公里，比第一个五年计划规定的新建铁路铺轨计划——四千零八十四公里，多铺了二十公里。
    我国从进入第一个五年计划以来，先后动工修建的新铁路约三十条。其中集（宁）二（连）、丰（台）沙（城）、黎（塘）湛（江）、蓝
  （村）烟（台）等主要干线，已经先后建成，并且都已经先后交付国家运营。
    兰新铁路原定在1957年修筑到甘肃白洋河（玉门附近），可是在今年6月间就铺轨到了玉门。兰州到武威段已经交付国家使用，武威到玉门段也已经开办临时运营。截至今年11月底，这条铁路的铺轨工程已经过玉门一百七十多公里到达九百六十三公里。至此，全线铺轨已经完成40％以上，现正继续向西挺进。
    鹰厦铁路原定在五年内修到福建省永安附近计四百四十三公里。截至今年11月底，铺轨已过角美车站，距终点厦门仅剩下三十几公里了。
    宝成铁路已经提前在今年7月13日接轨。现成都到广元段已经交付国家使用，广元到阳平段也已经开办临时运营。阳平以北现正集中力量修建收尾工程和运营设备。
    包兰铁路现正从南北两端分头修建。到今年11月底止，施工地段已展开三百六十多公里，并且已经铺轨约一百公里。
    由于原定的新建铁路计划提前完成，国家从执行第一个五年计划的第四年起，已经把原拟在第二个五年计划中修建的内昆、川黔等九条新线提前开工兴建。
    在执行第一个五年计划的过程中，参加新线建设的广大职工、铁道兵官兵和工程技术人员，在苏联专家的热诚指导和帮助下发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，因而迅速地完成了国家规定的修筑新铁路的计划，并且积累了丰富的筑路经验。这就给更多地争取超额完成第一个五年计划和积极准备第二个五年计划的铁路新线建设提供了更有力的保证。
    在第一个五年计划的前三年零十一个月中，平均每年铺轨一千多公里，比原定每年平均铺轨计划提高13％左右。
    新华社厦门7日电　今天下午四点三十分，鹰厦铁路铺轨部队把钢轨铺过了杏林港和厦门海峡，到达厦门岛南端的高崎村。
    上午六时，当铺轨部队官兵和民工们把一切准备停当，即将由集美海堤西端的同安县杏林村把钢轨从堤上铺向厦门的时候，迎候在堤上的、刚把海堤建筑完成的工程指挥部负责人和民工代表们，立即把鲜花献给铺轨部队官兵和民工。被称为“拉轨能手”的铺轨部队战士黄沛和他的战友们，在接过鲜花并向海堤建筑者致敬以后，立即从平车上拉下了第一对钢轨，铺到海堤右边的路基上。接着，铺轨部队官兵和民工们在从金门方向传来的隆隆炮声中和海堤工人、集美各学校师生和厦门市居民欢呼声中，以每小时平均铺轨六百九十多公尺的速度，把钢轨从长达五千零三十二公尺的集美海堤和厦门海堤上铺到了厦门岛。
    十一时五十分，铺轨部队在蒋军飞机来袭的警报声中，把钢轨铺过了集美海堤到达厦门境内的集美镇。在警报解除以后，四千多个海堤员工和集美各学校师生、厦门市居民隆重地举行了欢迎铺轨到厦门及庆祝集美海堤完工大会。中共厦门市委会常务委员、厦门市代理市长李文陵和海堤工程指挥部主任丁德峰、铺轨部队代表贾庆祥上校都在会上讲了话，相互祝贺铺轨到达厦门和集美海堤的胜利。
    海堤员工、集美镇各界人民和集美学校、集美华侨补习学校师生把锦旗和当地的多种土产品献给铺轨部队官兵和民工。铺轨部队官兵和民工也把锦旗献给了海堤员工。
    新华社呼和浩特7日电　一条一百五十多公里长的包头到白云鄂博铁矿区铁路的最后一根钢轨，在本月4日被钉在白云鄂博车站线路的枕木上。至此，包白铁路的铺轨工程，按原定计划提前二十七天完成了。
    这条铁路沿着乌拉山脚向前伸延，经过高山深沟和丘陵，爬过拔海一千五百公尺的高原。它的全线路基土石方工程，有五百五十万立方公尺。筑路员工在悬崖陡壁中筑起了五十三个中小桥梁，一百二十座涵管、拱涵和两个较大的隧道。
    铁路员工在修筑这条铁路的工程中，采用许多先进经验，节省了大量资金。如在二十一公里道堑工程的大爆破施工当中，为克服缺少黄色炸药的困难，职工们突破先例施用了黑色炸药，为国家节约了一千七百元。在所有桥涵主体工程和基础混凝土工程中，由于采用了石片挤浆法等办法，节约水泥六百五十四吨。
    这条铁路通车以后，白云鄂博铁矿区的矿石和营盘梁煤矿的煤，将源源运出。
