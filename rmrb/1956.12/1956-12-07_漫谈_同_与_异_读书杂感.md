　　Random Thoughts on "Sameness" and "Difference"
　　-- Reading Jottings
　　Yao Wenyuan
　　Having closed "Wandering," it was only nine o'clock, so I casually picked up a "Collected Annotations of Zhuangzi" to browse through.

　　"Zhuangzi" is truly a treasure trove sparkling with the fire of wisdom. Many of its stories, like "Butcher Ding Dismembering an Ox," "Seven Days and Hundun Died," "A Carp in a Dry Rut," etc., are so profoundly meaningful that one is amazed by the depth of the author's thought. Some sentences, such as "My life has a limit, but knowledge has no limit," "Seek me in a dried fish stall," etc., have long become common expressions used in many people's writings.

　　This time, I turned to the outer chapter "Zai You Eleventh," and suddenly a passage of words cut through this mood like scissors, making my attitude serious. Although these were words spoken by the ancients thousands of years ago, they seemed to be speaking to my own heart. It was a passage like this: "The people of the world all like others to be the same as themselves, and dislike others to be different from themselves. Those who desire what is the same as themselves and do not desire what is different from themselves do so because they have a mind for standing out from the crowd."

　　"The people of the world" do not like to hear different opinions. Why? Because they themselves have a desire to "stand out from the crowd." In modern terms, it is "individual heroism." They pursue personal prominence, not the pursuit of truth. They would prefer the whole world to be "the same as themselves," a single color.

　　How to treat opinions that are "different from oneself" is a fundamental question after the launch of the Hundred Schools of Thought. "The people of the world" cannot tolerate opposing opinions and often treat the other party roughly. Either they negate everything, or they always hold on to their own views, preventing different opinions from being improved through mutual penetration and supplementation. I think we should adhere to the opinions we believe to be correct, but we should also strive to eliminate this "worldly" air in our own minds, and especially remember the very sharp warning that closely follows the above passage: "Those who have a mind for standing out from the crowd, how can they ever truly stand out from the crowd!"

　　　　　　　　　　　　　＊

　　Because of connecting with reality, I couldn't continue reading "Zhuangzi," but I thought about the issue of sameness and difference. Recently, the opposition to the worship of authority has been very intense, and this is also a natural phenomenon. Because we have suffered too much from blindly applying dogma, and even more from lacking independent thinking and casually echoing others.

　　This cannot be blamed on celebrities, but should be blamed on those who value fame and worship them. This kind of mentality—let's call it the mentality of idol worshipers—needs to be constantly struggled against in the future.

　　However, I feel that apart from those fake authorities who are like cats in tiger skins, or pseudo-celebrities who deceive the world and steal their names, for all those who have been recognized as authorities because of their painstaking research and creation in a certain field, we must first cherish their achievements and humbly learn from them. Learning is different from worship. Worship is to treat the words of authority as unchanging dogma, while learning is to truly absorb everything correct and beneficial in the works of others or predecessors, but with one's own thinking, absorption, abandonment, and creation. If we don't learn from all the works of authority and want to build a building with "independent thinking" on an empty ground, I'm afraid it is impossible. If, because of opposing the worship of authority, we dare not even agree with or apply the correct words of authority, it would be like throwing away food because one is afraid of choking.

　　Speaking of "sameness" and "difference," I think Liu Xie's attitude is worth learning. In the "Preface to Ambition" of "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons," he talked about his opinions on various schools: "If there is agreement with previous theories, it is not imitation, but the situation itself cannot be different. If there is difference from previous theories, it is not to be deliberately different, but the principle itself cannot be the same." Everything lies in "principle." If others are reasonable, then agree with them, not imitate them; if others' reasons are not sufficient, then disagree with them, and not deliberately oppose them. This is the most correct independent thinking and academic attitude.

### 漫谈“同”与“异”——读书杂感

　　漫谈“同”与“异”
　　——读书杂感
　　姚文元
    阖上了“仿徨”，时间还只有九点钟，随手拿起一本“庄子集解”来翻翻。
      “庄子”也真是一座闪烁着智慧的火花的宝库。其中好多故事，像“庖丁解牛”“七日而浑沌死”“涸辙之鲋”……等，那含义的深远，真令人惊叹作者思想的深刻。有些句子如“吾生也有涯，而知也无涯”“索我于枯鱼之肆”……等等，早已成为许多人都熟悉的文章中通用的语言了。
    这一回我翻到了外篇“在宥第十一”，忽然有一段话像剪刀一样剪断了这种心情，使我态度严肃起来了，虽是几千年前古人说的话，竟好像说到自己心里。那是这样一段话：“世俗之人，皆喜人之同乎己，而恶人之异于己也。同于己而欲之，异于己而不欲者，以出乎众为心也。”
      “世俗之人”是不喜欢听不同的意见的，为什么呢，就因为他自己心中有一个“出乎众”的愿望。用现代的术语来说，就是“个人英雄主义”。他们追求的是个人出头，而不是追求真理。他们最好天下都
  “同于己”，清一色。
    如何对待“异于己”的意见，实在是百家争鸣开展后的一个根本问题。“世俗之人”容不得相反的意见，对待对方往往容易粗暴。或则一概否定，或则永远各执一见，使得不同意见不能从相互渗透相互补充当中完善起来。我想，我们应当坚持自以为正确的意见，但也应当努力消灭自己思想中这种“世俗”气，尤其应该记住上面一段话后面接紧着一句十分尖锐的警语：“夫以出于众为心者，曷尝出乎众哉！”
                              ＊
    由于联系了实际，‘庄子’读不下去了，却想到了同和异的问题。最近反对崇拜权威是很剧烈的，这也是一种自然的现象。因为盲目搬用教条而吃的苦头是太多了，至于因缺少独立思考，随随便便人云亦云而吃的苦头，那就更多了。
    这并不能怪名人，而应当怪那些以名为贵的崇拜者。对这种心理——姑且叫它拜佛者的心理吧，以后需要作不断的斗争。
    但是，我觉得除了那种像披着虎皮的猫一样的假权威，或者欺世盗名的伪名人以外，凡是因某一行刻苦研究创造而被公认为权威的，我们首先要珍视他的成就，虚心向他学习。学习和崇拜不同，崇拜是把权威的话当作万世不变的教条，学习是切切实实地吸取别人或前人著作中一切正确的有益的东西，但自己有思考、有吸收、有扬弃、有创造。如果所有权威的著作都不学习，想在空地上用“独立思考”建立大厦，恐怕是不可能的事。如果因反对权威崇拜而连权威正确的话也不敢同意或应用，也未免因噎废食了。
    谈到“同”与“异”，我觉得刘勰的态度值得我们学习。他在“文心雕龙”的“序志第五十”中讲到他对各派的意见时说：“有同乎前论者，非雷同也，势自不可异也。有异乎前论者，非苟异也，理自不可同也。”一切都在“理”，别人有理，就赞同他，而不是雷同；别人理由不够，就不同意他，也并非故意反对。这是最正确的独立思考的治学态度。
