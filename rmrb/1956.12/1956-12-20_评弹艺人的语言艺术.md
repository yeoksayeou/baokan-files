    The Language Art of Pingtan Performers
　　Gui Bingquan
    Pingtan is a singing art popular in the Wu dialect area. Pingtan performers need to speak, sing, and also express and gesture; the combination of speaking, singing, and acting is what makes it captivating. I particularly appreciate the former, and I think the language of Pingtan performers is vivid, lively, beautiful and novel. Whether it is a "large story" or a "small story," the performers have to describe various characters, including civil officials and military generals, talented scholars and beautiful ladies, maids and servants, and even gods, ghosts, and immortals. With so many characters and intricate plots, the language they use must be rich, diverse, vivid, and lively in order to attract the audience to listen for a full hundred and several tens of minutes.

    In the "biao" (the narrator's narration) and "bai" (the narrator speaking on behalf of the characters in the story) of Pingtan performers, there are many idioms, proverbs, and folk sayings. For example, in the story of "Wu Song," when it comes to Wu Erlang going to the Lion Tower to find Ximen Qing after killing his sister-in-law, curious young men followed him, heading straight for the restaurant. As they approached the restaurant, the diners upstairs, seeing the situation was not good, rushed downstairs to escape. "Wu Song, afraid that Ximen Qing would escape in the crowd, shouted: 'Where is Ximen Qing?' The diners dared not answer 'Ximen Qing is upstairs,' and everyone unanimously raised a forefinger, pointing upstairs, this is called 'a thousand fingers pointing.'" The use of "a thousand fingers pointing" here is appropriate and vivid, which can be considered good at describing the scene.

    In their narration, the performers are also good at using many parallel sentences, which are neat and fluent. Like in the "Four Jinshi" story, in the "Selling the Sister at the Wine Shop" section, when writing about Yang Chun stepping into the wine shop: "But seeing the master chef frying, stir-frying, roasting, and simmering; and also seeing in the shop the cashier writing, calculating, singing, and running..." Through language skills, the audience is given a concrete impression, as if walking into a restaurant, hearing the clashing of spatulas and spoons when cooking, and the shouts of the waiters. Sometimes, they use another way to show their language skills, like the following passage: "Yue Xian thought to herself, today two beautiful faces have met together. I really want to take a good look at my own beautiful face, to see if my beautiful face surpasses her beautiful face, or if her beautiful face surpasses my beautiful face; comparing the two beautiful faces, which face is ultimately more beautiful." This is simply a tongue twister performance. The performer blurts it out, fluent and rhythmic, giving the same artistic feeling.

    Chinese classical vernacular novel authors are known for their language art. The narration of Pingtan performers is creative and infectious, and this point can be compared with the language of old novels. They attach great importance to the choice of words, the structure of sentences, and the organization of sentences; they try to avoid vague and abstract words and sentences, and strive for vivid images and crisp and harmonious syllables. Only in this way can they make the audience feel as if they are seeing the characters and hearing their voices. In particular, some performers with higher singing and performing skills have exceptionally rich language in expressing characters and describing environments. If it could be selectively recorded, it would be a meaningful work. As for their expertise in ventriloquism, such as the sound of horses' hooves when Liu Jin served the Empress Dowager to burn incense at Famen Temple: "Qi gua qi... qi gua qi...", and the roar of a fierce general when he shows his power, such as the very long shouts of characters like Zhang Fei, the lingering sound is truly around the beams, and the sound shocks the audience, that is just extra.

### 评弹艺人的语言艺术

    评弹艺人的语言艺术
　　桂丙全
    评弹是盛行于吴方言区域的一种演唱艺术。评弹艺人要说、唱，还要表情、比划；说、唱、做配合起来，才能引人入胜。我特别欣赏前者，我觉得评弹艺人的语言是生动活泼、优美新颖的。无论“大书”也好，“小书”也好，演员要描述各种人物，有文臣武将，有才子佳人，有丫环奴仆，还有神鬼仙佛，人物既多，故事情节也曲折，因此，他所用的语言也必须丰富多采，生动活泼，才能吸引观众听足一百几十分钟。
    评弹艺人的“表”（说书人的叙述）“白”（说书人代书中人说话）里，有许多成语、谚语、民间的炼话。如像说“武松”的说到武二郎杀嫂以后，赶往狮子楼寻找西门庆，好事的少年在后相跟，直奔酒楼，将到酒楼之时，楼上众酒客见势不佳，纷纷下楼夺门而出，“武松恐怕西门庆混在人群中逃走，大喝一声：‘西门庆哪里？’众酒客不敢回答‘西门庆在楼上’，大家不约而同地竖起一个食指，指向楼上，这叫做‘千夫所指’。”“千夫所指”用在这里用得恰当而生动，可算善于描摩情景了。
    在表白中，艺人们还善于用许多排句，整齐而流利，像“四进士”里的“酒楼卖妹”一段，写杨春跨进酒楼：“但见掌锅的大师傅煎的煎，炒的炒，炰的炰，熬的熬；又见店堂里柜台上写的写，算的算，唱的唱，跑的跑……”通过语言技巧，给听众一种具体的印象，使人仿佛走进酒楼饭店，听到那炒菜时铲子、勺子的撞击声，跑堂工人的吆喝声。有时，又以另一种方式来显示其语言技巧，像下面的一段话：“月仙心里想，今朝两只标致面孔碰在一道了。我真倒要好好照照自家这只标致面孔，看看我这只标致面孔胜过她那只标致面孔，还是她那只标致面孔胜过我这只标致面孔；两只标致面孔比一比，到底哪一只面孔标致。”这又简直是绕口令表演了。表演者脱口而出，流利而有节奏，同样给人一种艺术的感受。
    中国古典白话小说作者是以语言艺术见长的。评弹艺人的表白，富于创造性，富于感染力，这一点可以和旧小说的语言媲美。他们很重视词汇的选择，语句的结构，句子的组织；极力避免含糊笼统的抽象词句，力求形象鲜明，音节爽朗谐和。这才能够做到使听众如见其人，如闻其声。特别是一些说唱技术较高的艺人，表现人物，描写环境的语言也格外丰富。倘能有选择地加以笔录，倒也是一件有意义的工作。至于他们的擅长口技，如刘瑾侍候太后到法门寺拈香时一路上的马蹄声：“乞瓜乞……乞瓜乞……”，又如猛将发威时的怒吼，如张飞等人物的一声非常之长的喊叫，真是余音绕梁，声惊四座，那又是余事了。
