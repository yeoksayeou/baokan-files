Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 2nd: The Du'an Yao Autonomous County in Guangxi Province has organized cadres to go to the countryside for visits to listen to the opinions of the ethnic minority people. The visiting work has recently ended, and at present, county and district departments are busy holding meetings to discuss the opinions and demands of the masses.

Beginning in October, Du'an Yao Autonomous County organized more than 1,000 county, district, and township cadres to form 24 teams (groups), led by the Secretary of the County Party Committee, the Deputy County Head, and the heads of the districts, to conduct visits in depth to 317 townships throughout the county. In addition to understanding the situation through various meetings, the cadres of each team also used their time in the morning and evening to visit households one by one, or went to the fields during the day to help farmers with production while visiting them. During the visits, the work teams, based on the fact that some agricultural cooperatives had reduced production due to disasters, and that the county had a history of water shortages in winter and spring, first found out how many households were short of food, how much grain was needed in total, when it should be supplied, and whether there were cotton clothes and quilts for the winter, and made an overall plan. First, they mobilized cooperative members to save themselves through production, and when they really could not solve the problem, the state provided grain and money for supply or relief. During the visit, the county distributed 7,000 sets of cotton clothes and a large number of cotton quilts to relieve poor farmers. Regarding the water shortage problem, with the assistance of the work teams, since October, all townships have been universally searching for water sources, opening ponds, and digging wells to solve the problem of drinking water for people and livestock.

During the visits, farmers of all ethnic groups raised many opinions on the problems existing in the work. Farmers criticized some cadres for blindly stipulating that 3,500 plants should be planted per mu when promoting dense planting of single maize plants in rocky mountain areas, and even forced replanting if there were not enough. In terms of financial and economic work, farmers of all ethnic groups requested strengthening of purchasing and supply work.

Regarding the opinions and demands of the masses, the work teams made self-criticisms or explanations to the masses on the spot regarding aspects of work style; regarding future development of production and production reform, some agricultural cooperatives, with the help of the work teams, have made appropriate arrangements after investigation and analysis, and some agricultural cooperatives in larger districts have also held member representative meetings to deal with many outstanding issues related to joining the cooperative.

　　都安瑶族自治县派出一千多干部
　　下乡访问少数民族农民
　　征求了意见，了解了要求，解决了问题
    新华社南宁2日电　广西省都安瑶族自治县组织干部下乡访问，倾听少数民族人民的意见。访问工作已在最近结束，目前县、区各部门都忙着召开会议，讨论群众的意见和要求。
    都安瑶族自治县从十月份开始，组织了一千多名县、区、乡干部，成立二十四个队（组），由中共县委书记、副县长和区的负责人带领，分别深入到全县三百一十七个乡进行访问。除通过各种会议了解情况外，各队干部还利用早晚时间挨门逐户访问，或者白天到田间一面帮助农民生产，一面访问。访问期间，工作队根据有些农业社因灾减产，和全县历年冬春缺水等情况，先摸清有多少缺粮户，共缺多少粮，该在什么时候供应，以及有无过冬的棉衣、被子等，作出通盘规划。首先发动社员生产自救，真正不能解决的，由国家出粮、出钱供应或救济。在访问期间，全县发放了七千套棉衣和大批棉被，救济贫困农民。关于缺水问题，在工作队的协助下，十月份以来，各乡普遍找水源、开塘、挖井，解决人、畜吃水。
    在访问中，各族农民对工作中存在的问题提出了许多意见，农民批评有些干部在石山地区推行玉米单株密植时，也盲目规定每亩种三千五百株，不够的还要强迫补种，在财经工作方面，各族农民要求加强收购供应工作。
    对群众的意见和要求，属于工作作风方面的，工作队都当面向群众作了检讨或说明；属于今后发展生产和生产改革方面的，部分农业社在工作队的帮助下经过调查分析，已作了适当安排，大城区有些农业社还召开了社员代表会议，处理了许多入社遗留问题。
