Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 5th: The Anshan Metallurgical Construction Corporation is actively seeking ways to resolve the contradiction between the large amount of construction work and the shortage of materials in the first quarter of next year.

The amount of construction work at Anshan Iron and Steel Works in the first quarter of next year will be much greater than in the same period of previous years, and building materials will be insufficient. The planners of this company began preparing the material supply plan for next year more than a month earlier than in previous years. When preparing the plan, they no longer adopted a rough estimation method, but actively went deep into the construction site and contacted the design department to propose relatively accurate quantities, types, and specifications of required materials. For steel, cement, and wood that were still insufficient, all relevant units proposed solutions.

In terms of steel, employees adopted the method of "using old materials as much as possible, making use of every bit and piece," and tried to utilize the old steel recovered from construction sites. In recent months, a large amount of recovered old steel has been sent to steel rolling mills and ironwork cooperatives in Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin and other places for processing. After appraisal, it was deemed that more than 1,000 tons could be utilized. The company also plans to adopt many technical measures that can save steel, such as using reinforced concrete structures instead of many types of steel structures. According to the material supply department's estimate, the structural steel required in the first quarter of next year is entirely likely to be met.

According to the person in charge of the technical supply department, the several thousand tons of cement lacking in the first quarter of next year can also be solved by saving. Technical inspection personnel used blast furnace slag and tailings discarded by the concentrator as admixtures to make two types of concrete, which can reduce the use of cement by more than 10 kilograms per cubic meter. Workers on the construction site also proposed many ways to save cement.

Regarding the most difficult wood problem to solve, in addition to formulating measures to save wood and mobilizing employees to find solutions, the company is also purchasing bamboo to be used as a substitute for some of the wood.

### 眼睛向下挖潜力，不在困难面前叫苦  鞍钢明春所需建筑材料基本解决

    眼睛向下挖潜力，不在困难面前叫苦
    鞍钢明春所需建筑材料基本解决
    新华社鞍山5日电　鞍山冶金建筑总公司正在积极想办法解决明年第一季度工程量大和材料缺乏的矛盾。
    明年第一季度鞍钢的施工量将比往年同期大得多，建筑材料不敷需要。这个公司的计划工作者已经比往年提早一个多月开始编制明年的材料供应计划。在编制计划的时候，他们不再采取粗糙的估算方法，而是主动地深入工地，联系设计部门，提出了比较精确的需用材料的数量、种类和规格。对仍然不足的钢材、水泥、木料，各有关单位都提出了解决措施。
    在钢材方面，职工们采取“尽可能利用旧料，边边角角派用场”的办法，把从工地上回收来的旧钢材，设法加以利用。近几个月来，许多回收来的旧钢材被送到上海、沈阳、天津等地的轧钢厂和铁工合作社加工，经过鉴定，认为可以利用的有一千多吨。这个公司还计划采用许多可以节约钢材的技术措施，比如用钢筋混凝土结构代替许多种钢结构等。据材料供应部门预计，明年第一季度要用的结构钢材，完全可能得到满足。
    据技术供应部门的负责人说，明年第一季度缺少的几千吨水泥，也可以用节约的办法得到解决。技术检验人员用高炉的矿渣、选矿厂不要的尾矿作掺合料，制成了两种混凝土，每立方公尺可以少用十公斤以上的水泥。工地上的职工也提出了许多节约水泥的办法。
    对最难解决的木材问题，这个公司除制定了节约木材措施，发动职工想办法以外，还正在购买竹材，准备用来代替部分木材。
