Together with Little Liang, oh Little Liang, why are you looking at me like that, with your eyes wide open… Come here, let me—this good friend—kiss you! I come from a faraway place—from Albania, are you listening? You are hope, you will grow up, Liang, for our new era. When I was as young as you, I had no friends. In my country, at that time, Liang, everything seemed like an enemy. They came to Albania, plundered everything, leaving only desolation… Today, we, oh Little Liang, have become our own masters… Look, how dramatically the times have changed, how beautifully we live! Today, we are no longer alone, we have countless friends! From Albania to Asia, a star shines upon us, and now, Little Liang, even you welcome friends every day… Our country will become even more beautiful, all the thorns will be cleared away. Countless flowers will bloom, how wonderful our lives will be! I don't have a face like yours, why are you looking at me like that? A light shines in my eyes,
	And also in your eyes! Come here! Let me kiss you again, oh, Liang… I have to go, in Albania my son—Jordan—is waiting for me. Oh, when you grow up, you will be esteemed friends! Friendship will become the most precious thing for you!
〔Note〕Little Liang is a four-year-old child whom the author met on the bank of the Pearl River in Guangdong.

专栏：

　　和小梁在一起呵，小梁，你为什么这样看着我，圆睁着双眼……过来吧，让我——这个好朋友，亲一亲你！我来自遥远的地方——来自阿尔巴尼亚，你听着吗？你是希望，你将会长大，梁，为了我们新的时代。在我像你这样幼小的时候，我没有过任何朋友。在我国，那时候，梁，一切都好像是仇敌。来到阿尔巴尼亚，把一切掠夺一空，只留下一片荒凉……今天，我们，呵小梁做了自己的主人……看呵，时代变得多么厉害，我们生活得多美！今天，我们不再是孤孤单单，我们有着数不尽的朋友！从阿尔巴尼亚到亚细亚，一颗星星照耀着我们，现在，小梁，就是你也每天迎接着友人……我们的国家将变得更加美丽，所有的荆棘将要清除干净。无数的鲜花就要开放，我们将生活得多么美好！我没有你那样的脸庞，为什么这样看着我？我的眼睛里闪耀着一股光辉，
  这样也在你的眼里！过来吧！让我再一次地
  吻一吻你，呵，梁……我要走了，在阿尔巴尼亚等着我我的儿子——约尔旦。呵，当你们长大成人的时候将会是尊贵的友人！友谊，将成为你们最珍贵的东西！〔注〕　小梁，是一个四岁的孩子，作者在广东珠江边上遇到过他。
