Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 27th. Lu Bingkun, a Kuomintang agent who plotted to blow up the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, surrendered himself to the public security organs three days after sneaking into Shanghai from Taiwan. The Shanghai Municipal Procuratorate announced on the 25th that Lu Bingkun would be exempt from prosecution.

    The public security organs verified that Lu Bingkun was an agent dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek Group's "National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau." On November 7th this year, Lu Bingkun sneaked into Guangzhou from Kowloon under the guise of a mason. On the 11th, he returned to his home in the western suburbs of Shanghai, attempting to use his family as cover before proceeding to survey the terrain along the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway and formulate a bombing plan. According to Lu Bingkun's confession, he received technical training in demolition and secret writing in Taiwan in August this year.

    After this "mason," who had been a Kuomintang agent for seven or eight years, returned home, he saw that the loft where his family had originally lived had been transformed into two spacious rooms, and the dilapidated shacks around his home had become the beautiful Caoyang New Village. Relatives often talked to him about the improved living conditions since liberation, and his mother scolded him for fleeing to Hong Kong in the past. Friends who knew that he had participated in a special agent organization patiently explained the government's policy of leniency towards counter-revolutionaries. Lu Bingkun considered it for two days and voluntarily surrendered himself to the public security organs on the 13th. Zhuang Shuiying, a female worker who had been divorced from Lu Bingkun for many years, saw that he was truly remorseful and wanted to start anew, and she resumed her marital relationship with him.

    一名特务自动投案
    检察机关宣布免予起诉
    新华社上海27日电　图谋爆破鹰厦铁路的国民党派遣特务陆炳坤，从台湾潜入上海后第三天，向公安机关投案自首。上海市检察机关在25日宣布对陆炳坤免予起诉。
    公安机关查明，陆炳坤是蒋介石集团“国家安全局情报局”派遣特务。今年11月7日，陆炳坤以泥水匠身份从九龙潜入广州，11日回到上海西郊区他的家里，企图以家庭作掩护，再到鹰厦铁路沿线勘察地形，制定爆破计划。据陆炳坤供称，今年8月，他在台湾曾受到爆破和密写等技术训练。
    这个干了七八年国民党特务的“泥水匠”回家后，看到原先一家人住的搁楼已经变成两间宽敞的房屋，家四周的破烂棚房变成美丽的曹阳新村。亲戚们经常向他畅谈解放后生活改善的情况，母亲责怪他当年不该逃往香港。知道他参加过特务组织的朋友耐心向他讲解政府对反革命分子宽大处理的政策。陆炳坤考虑了两天，13日就自动到公安机关投案自首。和陆炳坤离婚多年的女工庄水英见到他真心悔过，重新做人，也和他恢复了夫妻关系。
