    Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan
    Refuse to Attend Muslim Countries Conference
    Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, December 24th: Iran recently suggested to the governments of many Middle Eastern countries that a conference of Muslim countries be held. It is reported that Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey, members of the Baghdad Pact, have expressed their desire to participate in the aforementioned conference. However, other Muslim countries oppose this proposal. According to Arab newspapers, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan have all refused to attend the conference.
    From Iranian newspapers, it can be seen that the purpose of convening this conference is actually to consolidate the Baghdad Pact. "Farda Newspaper" believes that the United States and Britain "endorse the convening of this conference." "Ittila'at" said in this regard that "the United States government has expressed its pleasure with the Iranian government's decision."

    叙埃沙约四国
    拒绝参加穆斯林国家会议
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社德黑兰24日讯：伊朗最近向中东许多国家的政府建议召开穆斯林国家会议。据悉，伊拉克、巴基斯坦和土耳其等巴格达条约成员国表示希望参加上述会议。但是，其他穆斯林国家反对这种主张。据阿拉伯报纸报道，叙利亚、埃及、沙特阿拉伯和约旦都拒绝参加会议。
    从伊朗报上可以看出，召开这个会议的目的实际上是想巩固巴格达条约。“法尔达报”认为，美国和英国“赞同召开这个会议”。“控诉报”在这方面说，“美国政府对伊朗政府的决定表示高兴”。
