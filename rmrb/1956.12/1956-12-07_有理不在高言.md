    "Reason Doesn't Lie in Loud Words"
    Wu Bing'an

    In life, we often encounter the phenomenon of "being unreasonable when one is in the right." Some people, when they happen to grab someone's minor mistake, will not let go of it and will entangle themselves endlessly, even to the point of harshly criticizing and publicizing it everywhere. These people often seek opportunities to rely on "being in the right" as a basis to issue all kinds of "loud words" filled with meanness, making people unable to detect any scent of goodwill.

    The article "Don't Arbitrarily Change" (author Lin Ruji), published on page 8 of the People's Daily on November 22, has a strong taste of "being unreasonable when one is in the right." This article seized upon the unfortunate mistake of a certain editor who changed "Manchu Dynasty" to "Former Qing Dynasty" in the author's quote from Mr. Lu Xun's article, and harshly criticized it. Saying things like, "This should be considered a strange event in this year's commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death," what "the editor comrade's self-established rules and regulations…," what "I would like to ask this overly meticulous editor, and ask him to try looking at the article that has been changed in that way, to see if he would burst out laughing," what "dogmatic editor," and so on. The mistake of this editor comrade should be criticized. However, why is it necessary to ridicule and denounce him so extensively? The purpose of criticism is to help others correct their mistakes, and therefore it is always "persuading people with reason." If exposing other people's mistakes is only to vent one's anger and feel pleased with oneself, then he will inevitably be aggressive and "unreasonable when in the right." As the saying goes, "Reason doesn't lie in loud words," which is worth pondering!

    “有理不在高言”乌丙安
    生活中常碰到“得理不让人”的现象。有些人偶然抓住别人的一条小辫子，就不放松地纠缠起来，甚至大加斥责，满世界宣扬。这些人常常寻找机会以“有理”为凭借，发表各种各样带有刻薄成分的“高言”，使人闻不到善意的气味。
    11月22日人民日报第八版刊载的“不要蛮改”（作者林如稷）一文，就颇有“得理不让人”的味道。这篇文章抓住了某编辑把作者引用鲁迅先生文章中的“满清”改为“前清”这条倒霉的小辫子，大加斥责。说什么“这也要算今年纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年中一件奇事吧”，什么“这位编辑同志自立的清规戒律……”，什么“我想请教于这位过于拘泥的编者，并请他拿那样改过的文章来试看一下，是不是会哑然失笑”，什么“教条主义的编辑”等等。这位编辑同志的错误，该当批评。但是，又何必一定要大肆嘲讽、痛斥一番呢？批评者的目的在于帮助别人改正错误，因而总是“以理服人”。如果揭发别人的错误，只是为了泄胸中之愤，大快己心，那末，他必然是气势汹汹地“得理不让人”。常言道，“有理不在高言”，值得三思！
