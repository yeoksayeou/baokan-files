　　Spending Sprees Again
　　Wang Pu
　　Now that the end of the year is approaching, some government agencies, organizations, institutions, and enterprises in various localities are starting to engage in spending sprees. After calculating their budget allocations and bank deposits, they realize they may have a significant surplus. Consequently, they rush to spend it before the year ends, flocking to the market to purchase goods in large quantities. Some units are preparing to withdraw bank deposits to buy items that are not urgently needed. For instance, one department requested to purchase an electric meat grinder, while another requested dozens of hot pots. Are these items truly necessary?

　　The recent market situation indicates that this phenomenon of spending sprees is increasing. Electrical appliance companies, instrument companies, cultural supply companies, lumberyards, and furniture stores are doing brisk business. Customers are crowded, with many public procurement personnel eagerly lining up to buy various furniture and instruments. More seriously, some units even dispatch multiple procurement personnel to stand in line in order to buy more goods. It can be said that these comrades are truly “meticulous in their calculations,” but unfortunately, this meticulousness is not in the interest of the country. Moreover, this practice has occurred in previous years as well.

　　The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have instructed us to increase production, conserve expenditures, promote a spirit of hard work and simplicity, oppose extravagance and waste, and advocate building the country through diligence and thrift. However, some of our units are striving to spend money, buying many unnecessary or not-yet-necessary items. This practice not only wastes state funds but also violates financial discipline. Furthermore, it adds pressure to the supply of goods, creating artificial tension in the market.

　　There is only one month left until the end of the year! Immediately paying attention to correcting this phenomenon of spending sprees from now on will still have a significant impact. To effectively rectify this phenomenon, the agencies responsible for supervising budget allocations should rigorously review the spending requests submitted by various units, examining whether their requests are reasonable and necessary. The People's Bank, responsible for handling cash receipts and disbursements, should also inquire about the intended use of withdrawals requested by government agencies, organizations, institutions, and enterprises. More importantly, leading comrades of each unit should pay more attention to understanding and grasping the spending situation of their unit's general affairs and finance departments during this period. Upon discovering spending sprees, they should immediately stop them and educate or appropriately criticize the relevant personnel. Of course, those expenditures that are completely legitimate and absolutely necessary are not included in this; however, even when spending, the spirit of diligence and thrift should be upheld.

### 又突击花钱了

　　又突击花钱了
　　王朴
    现在已经将到年终，各地方开始出现一些机关、团体、事业和企业单位突击花钱的现象。他们计算一下自己的预算拨款和银行存款可能还有长余，于是赶着要在年前把它花出去，跑到市场上去大批地采购物资。有些单位正在准备提用银行存款购买并非急需的物资。比如有一个部门要求购买一部电动绞肉机，有一个部门要求购买几十个火锅。这些东西难道是一定需要的么？
    从最近市场上的情况可以看出，这种突击花钱的现象是增多了。交电公司、仪器公司、文化用品公司、木材厂和家具行的买卖很好，顾客拥挤，很多公家的采购人员，争先恐后排队购买各种家具和仪器。更严重的是，有些单位为了多买东西，还派出若干采购人员去排队。这些单位的同志可以说是真能“精打细算”了，可惜这种精打细算并不是为国家着想的。而这种做法，往年也是有的。
    中共中央和国务院指示我们应当增加生产，节约开支，要我们发扬艰苦朴素作风，反对铺张浪费，提倡勤俭建国。但是，我们的某些单位，却是在努力花钱，买许多不必要的或者一下子还不必要的东西。这种作法，不仅是浪费国家的资金，而且是一种违犯财政纪律的行为，而且这样作还会加重物资供应的压力，造成市场的人为的紧张。
    离年终只有一个月了！从现在起立即注意纠正这种突击花钱的现象，还是有很大作用的。为了有效地纠正这种现象，负责监督预算拨款的机关，对于各单位提出的用钱要求，应当进行严格审查，审查他们的要求是否合理，是否需要；负责办理现金收支的人民银行，对于机关、团体、事业、企业单位提取存款的要求，也应该过问一下提款的用途；更重要的是，各单位的领导同志在这个时期，应当更多地注意了解掌握本单位总务部门和财务部门的花钱情况，一发现突击花钱的现象，应当立即制止，并向有关人员进行教育或者给以适当批评。当然，那些花得完全正当完全必要的钱，是不在此列的；不过花时也应本着勤俭节约的精神。
