　　"Meeting the Prefect" and "Meeting the Ministry"
　　Zuguo Chun
    In "Fifteen Strings of Cash," Kuang Zhong's struggle against the bureaucratic Zhou Cen is manifested in the scene "Meeting the Prefect." Late at night, Kuang Zhong anxiously waits to be received in his superior's living room. Zhou Cen delays the meeting, making excuses. Finally, unable to delay any longer, he is forced to grant the audience.

    On October 20th, the People's Daily published Yi Huai's article "On the Difficulty of Seeing Leaders" on page four. Some of the facts seem like jokes.

    Of course, these are isolated and extremely rare cases. To ensure that such things "decrease to nothing," it might be helpful to offer a few words of reminder.

    Subordinates come to Beijing from other places to seek an audience with a Minister, only to be kept waiting in the guesthouse for ten days to half a month, then another half a month or ten days. However, after waiting a long time without being "seen," the subordinates become impatient and look for loopholes—"sending telegrams," one could say, is a sign of desperation.

    In other provinces, subordinates seeking an audience with a Director-General are kept waiting in the guesthouse for "half a month," and might wait another ten days. They might also become desperate and resourceful.

    In "Fifteen Strings of Cash," the subordinate Kuang Zhong and his superior Zhou Cen live in the same city. Kuang Zhong "meeting" the prefect, according to the system at the time, involved beating a drum in front of the court, and the superior had no choice but to receive him. According to the plot on stage, Kuang Zhong only waited an hour or two before seeing his superior.

    In Yi Huai's article, the subordinates travel from other places to Beijing or provincial capitals by train or plane. The subordinates "meeting" the ministry, the subordinates "meeting" the department, involves waiting for ten days to half a month, and still not necessarily being seen. This shows that there are still aspects of our working system that must be improved.

    Although sending telegrams can replace beating drums, and sending telegrams is a modern method of "requesting a meeting," this method is not to be encouraged. As soon as the drum sounds, the superior immediately hears it. When a telegram is sent, who knows when the leader will see it? From this point of view, can receiving subordinates before the fifth watch of the night be considered a small advantage of Zhou Cen?

    Of course, today's society and the old society are worlds apart; today's leaders and the superiors of the old days cannot be compared. There is an essential difference between the two. What is discussed here is only the manner and method of "meeting," not equating "prefects" and "ministries" or confusing the two. This should be obvious.

    Chinese people have many affairs, so naturally the leaders are busy. However, in the central ministries, the leaders number at least four or five, and at most eight or nine. It is entirely possible for them to spare a little time from approving documents, holding meetings, and reading reports to receive subordinates who should be received as soon as possible, saving the subordinates some time and saving the guesthouse some water and electricity.

    I fully agree with the editor's words on page four of the November 28th People's Daily: "Go deep immediately, go deep regularly." The first step in going deep is, of course, "meeting" subordinates.

### “见都”和“见部”

　　“见都”和“见部”
　　祖国春
    在“十五贯”里，况钟同官僚主义者周岑的斗争表现于“见都”一场。夜静更深，况钟在上司的客厅里恭候接见，十分焦急。周岑迟迟不出，一味推延。终于推无可推，只得接见。
    10月20日，人民日报第四版上发表了易槐的文章“谈首长难见”。有些事实好像是笑话。
    这当然是个别的、极其少有的事例。为了让这样的事“从少到无”，还是可以说几句话提醒一下的。
    下级从外地来到北京，求见部长，在招待所里，一等就是十天半月，再等又是半月十天。然而久等不“见”，下级等急了，便找窍门——“拍电报”，也可以说是情急智生了。
    在外省，下级求见厅长，住在招待所里，也“一等就是半月”，再等可能又是十天。他们也会情急智生的吧。
    在“十五贯”里，下司况钟和上司周岑是住在一个城里的。况钟“见”都，按当时制度，在堂前击鼓，上司非接见不可。据舞台上的剧情看来，况钟只等了一两个小时就见到了上司。
    在易槐的文章里，下级是从外地乘火车或飞机来到北京或省会的。下级“见”部，下级“见”厅，一等就是十天半月，还未必见到。可见我们的工作制度上尚有必须改进的地方。
    虽然打电报可以代替打鼓，打电报是现代化的“请求见面”的方法，但是这个方法是不足为训的。鼓声一响，上司立刻听得见。电报发出去，谁知道首长什么时候看得见呢。从这一点看，五鼓天明前接“见”下司，能不能算作周岑的一个小小的优点呢？
    当然，今天的社会和旧时代的社会，既有天壤之别；今天的首长和旧时代的上司，也不能相提并论。二者之间有本质上的差别。这里所谈的只是“见”的方式方法，不是把“都”和“部”等量齐观、混为一谈。这是可以一目了然的。
    中国人多事多，自然首长们就忙了。不过，在中央各部里，首长少则四、五人，多则八、九人，他们从批文件、开会议、看报告上抽出一点时间，早日接见应当接见的下级，为下级节省一点时间，为招待所节约一点水电，是完全可能的。
    我十分赞成11月28日人民日报第四版上编辑的话：“立即深入下去，经常深入下去。”深入下去的第一步，当然是接“见”下级了。
