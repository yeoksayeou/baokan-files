    The education work in the pastoral areas of Gansu Province has developed greatly. Up to now, there are 150 fixed and pastoral-characteristic tent elementary schools in Xiahe, Zhuoni, Tianzhu, Sunan, Subei, Akesai, Luqu, and Maqu, with more than 12,000 students of Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, and Han nationalities, an increase of 47% in schools and 68.7% in students compared with 1953. In Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, there are now 65 elementary schools, more than three times the number in 1950, and the number of students has increased more than twenty times.
    The characteristics of the pastoral areas of Gansu Province are large area, scattered residence, high mobility, inconvenient transportation, and large seasonal differences. According to these characteristics, the province has adopted different methods to run elementary schools in pastoral areas. For example, Tianzhu, Sunan, Xiahe and other counties and autonomous counties have adopted a fixed method to concentrate on running elementary schools well; Subei, Akesai and other regions use a combination of fixed and mobile methods, that is, both fixed schools and tent schools. In the arrangement of class time in schools, all localities have taken into account the characteristics of pastoral areas and the living habits of herdsmen, which greatly facilitates herdsmen to send their children to school.
    In recent years, Gansu Province has adopted a combination of long-term and short-term training to cultivate a group of teachers in pastoral areas. In 1952, three junior normal schools were established in Xiahe, Zhuoni and Tianzhu successively. In addition, there are normal classes and teacher training classes in Tianzhu Junior Normal School, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Cadre School and Northwest Nationalities Institute, which send new teachers to pastoral areas every year. These teachers are generally active, enthusiastic and willing to work in their positions. Some people have basically learned minority languages and use them to teach. (Qiang Zhenkun)
    Also, as large-scale industry and various economic construction undertakings develop, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has established more than 20 secondary technical schools, worker technical schools, and secondary vocational schools. These include industrial technical schools for the iron and steel industry, machinery manufacturing, metallurgical construction, and sugar refinery worker schools serving modern industry. There are 11 such schools opened in Baotou, the base of the iron and steel industry. There are also various secondary specialized schools for agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, commerce, finance and economics, and health serving other construction projects. More than 11,000 people are studying in these schools. In addition to Han students, there are also Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, Korean, and Oroqen students. According to statistics from some schools, students from Mongolian and other ethnic minorities account for about one-tenth. In the past few years, some schools have trained hundreds or thousands of professional technicians from ethnic minorities.

    甘肃牧区教育事业发展很快
    内蒙古建立许多中等专业技术学校
    本报讯　甘肃省的牧区教育工作有了很大发展。到目前为止，夏河、卓尼、天祝、肃南、肃北、阿克塞、碌曲和玛曲等八个地区，共有一百五十所固定和适合牧区特点的帐篷小学，有藏、蒙古、回、汉各族学生一万二千多名；比1953年学校增加了47％，学生增加了68.7％。天祝藏族自治县，现在已有六十五所小学，较1950年增加了两倍多，学生增加了二十多倍。
    甘肃省牧区特点是面积大，居住分散，流动性大，交通不便，季节差异很大。根据这些特点，该省采取不同的方式办理牧区小学。例如天祝、肃南、夏河等县和自治县，已经采取固定的方式集中办好小学；肃北、阿克塞等地区是固定和流动两种方式兼用，也就是固定学校和帐篷学校两种都有。在学校上课时间的安排上，各地都照顾了牧业区的特点和牧民生活习惯，大大便利了牧民们把自己的子女送去上学。
    几年来，甘肃省采取了长期同短期训练相结合的办法培养了一批牧区师资。1952年先后在夏河、卓尼和天祝三个地区设立了三所初级师范学校。此外，还在天祝初师、甘南藏族自治州干部学校和西北民族学院设有师范班和师资训练班，每年都给牧区输送了新的教师，这些教师在工作岗位上一般都积极热情肯干。有些人已经基本上学会了少数民族语言，并且运用民族语言进行教学。　　（强震坤）
    又讯　内蒙古自治区随着大工业和各项经济建设事业的发展，已经建立了二十多所中等技术学校、工人技术学校和中等专业学校。其中有为现代工业服务的钢铁工业、机械制造、冶金建筑等工业技术学校和制糖工人学校。这类学校在钢铁工业基地的包头开办的就有十一所。还有为其他各项建设服务的农牧业、林业、商业、财经和卫生等各种中等专业学校。在这些学校学习的共有一万一千余人，除汉族学员外，还有蒙古、回、满、朝鲜和鄂伦春等兄弟民族。根据某些学校的统计，蒙古族和其他各少数民族的学生约占十分之一。过去几年来，有些学校已经培养了成百上千的少数民族的专业技术人员。
