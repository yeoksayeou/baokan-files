　　Suggestions for Increasing Production and Saving Paper
　　Expedite the Use of Idle Pulping Equipment
　　The shortage of pulp in the paper industry is currently quite serious. Some paper mills are unable to increase production because of insufficient pulp supply. According to the Paper Industry Bureau's statistics, there will be a shortage of 30,000 tons of pulp next year. However, under these circumstances, there is still a considerable amount of pulping steaming equipment lying idle in paper mills. For example, enterprises under the Paper Industry Bureau have seventeen idle steaming pots of various sizes. If these were utilized, they could produce 40,000 tons of bleached grass pulp annually. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jiangsu, there are also more than thirty steaming pots that are not being used. If all of this equipment could be put into production, it could produce at least 20,000 tons of bleached grass pulp annually. Of course, some of this steaming equipment is incomplete, some has only one steaming sphere, and some is in disrepair and needs renovation before it can be put into production.
　　However, it is not impossible to utilize this steaming equipment. For example, the local state-owned Zhejiang Bamboo Pulp Factory uses only one twelve-foot steaming pot and simple washing equipment to produce more than 1,500 tons of bleached wet bamboo pulp for Shanghai paper factories each year. Another example is Jilin Province, which plans to utilize a paper mill in Hailong County to concentrate several idle steaming pots and specialize in pulp production, solving the pulp shortage problem for several nearby paper mills. These methods are worthy of attention.
　　It is hoped that all paper mills with idle steaming equipment will quickly utilize it to produce more pulp to meet the needs of increased paper production. Zhang He
　　Do Not Repeatedly Issue Documents
　　With the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, the need for paper is constantly increasing. Therefore, the supply of paper appears somewhat tight at present. In addition to the paper industry departments taking measures to increase production, all organizations and groups should also try to save as much paper as possible.
　　Currently, the waste of paper in various organizations and groups is relatively serious. For example, in the trade union system, there are a lot of daily topical studies, experience introductions, circulars, situation reports, bulletins, copies, references for labor movement and business learning, special issues, compilations, and special publications for business systems. The Sichuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has printed more than a dozen kinds of materials from last year to the present, and the number of copies printed is considerable. In terms of content, many are repetitive. For example, the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions reprinted the People's Daily editorial "Eliminating Backwardness and Promoting Progress is the Responsibility of Leadership" of January 25, 1956, in two different booklets. There are also many times when documents are repeatedly issued between the province and the city. For example, in May of this year, the Chongqing First Machinery Trade Union had already printed materials on various advanced experiences, and the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions wanted to compile these advanced experiences into a book. Many of these advanced experiences have already been introduced in newspapers. A lot of paper has been wasted. Therefore, I suggest that the trade union system print as few unnecessary pamphlets as possible. Trade unions at all levels should communicate with each other to avoid repeated printing of some documents, so that a lot of paper can be saved. Yang Zhiming
　　Purchase Used Books
　　Using old books to save paper is a good way to solve the problem of paper supply falling short of demand.
　　In society, some people have many books that they do not need but others do. In schools, many books that higher grades have used and lower grades can also use. If Xinhua Bookstore can truly set up purchasing stations to allow readers to sell the books they have read, this problem will be solved. They will not have to sell them to waste paper collectors for a few cents a pound, allowing useful books to be used as pulp or to wrap candies.
　　Some schools often buy large quantities of the same type of books, especially literary books, and then leave them idle on the shelves. For example, the former Sunan Industrial College bought more than a hundred copies of "Far from Moscow," which soon became backlogged. I suggest that the relevant departments consider this issue to give full play to the role of books. Yu Mingde
　　Improve Ink Packaging
　　Currently, the ink sold by commercial departments in various places is packaged in small paper boxes for each small bottle. In fact, many customers throw away the paper boxes after buying the ink. The New Culture Science Ink produced by the local state-owned Luda Cultural and Educational Supplies Factory uses imported "Manila" and "White Board" paper for the small paper boxes. Each ream of this paper can be cut into 12,250 small boxes. The factory uses at least 200 reams of paper each year, spending more than 70,000 yuan. If the packaging paper of all ink manufacturers across the country is added up, the number would be considerable. If the packaging is improved, it will not only save the country money but also reduce the burden on consumers and alleviate the tight paper supply situation. Wang Furen

### 对增产节约纸张的建议

　　对增产节约纸张的建议
　　赶快利用闲置的制浆设备
    目前造纸工业部门纸浆不足的情况是相当严重的。有些造纸厂因为纸浆供应不上而无法增产。据造纸局统计，明年用的纸浆差三万吨。可是就在这种情况下，还有不少制浆的蒸煮设备闲置在造纸厂里。如造纸局所属企业闲置的大小蒸煮器有十七台，如果利用起来，每年可以生产漂白草浆四万吨。据辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、江苏等四省的不完全统计，也有三十多个蒸煮器未加利用，如果这些设备都能投入生产，每年至少可以生产漂白草浆二万吨。当然，这些蒸煮设备有的残缺不全，有的仅有一个蒸球，有的年久失修，需要经过一番装修，才能投入生产。
    但是，要利用这些蒸煮设备并不是不可能的。如地方国营浙江竹浆厂，只用一个十二尺的蒸煮器和简单的洗涤设备，每年为上海造纸工厂生产一千五百多吨漂白湿竹浆。又如吉林省准备利用海龙县一个纸厂，集中几个闲置的蒸煮器，专门生产纸浆，解决附近几个纸厂缺浆的问题。这些办法，都是值得重视的。
    希望凡有闲置蒸煮设备的造纸厂，赶快把它利用起来，生产更多的纸浆满足增产纸张的需要。张核
    不要重复印发文件
    随着人民物质文化生活水平的提高，对纸张的需要不断增长，因此纸的供应在目前显得有些紧张。这除了造纸工业部门采取措施增加产量外，各机关、团体在用纸方面也应尽量节约。
    目前，各机关、团体在用纸方面的浪费是比较严重的。如在工会系统中，日常的专题、经验介绍、通报、情况反映、简报、抄件、工运、业务学习参考资料、专刊、汇编以及业务系统的专刊资料等文件非常多。四川省工会联合会从去年到现在所印的资料就有十几种，而且印的份量都不少。从内容来说，很多都是重复的。如1956年1月25日人民日报社论“消除落后推动前进是领导的责任”一文，四川省工会联合会先后在两个册子上转载。省和市之间重复印发文件的时候也很多，如今年5月份，重庆市第一机械工会已印了各种先进经验的资料，四川省工会又要把这些先进经验汇编成册。而这些先进经验很多是报纸已经介绍过的。浪费了很多纸张。因此，我建议工会系统尽可能少印发一些不必要的小册子。各级工会应该互相通气，避免一些文件的重复印发，这样就可以节约不少的纸张。阳志明
　  收购旧书
    利用旧书，节约纸张，是解决纸张供不应求的一种好办法。
    在社会上，有人有许多他不需用而别人需用的书；在学校里，许多高年级用了而低年级也可以用的书，如果新华书店真能做到设收购站，让读者把读过的书拿去出售，这个问题就解决了，他们就不必一角钱一斤拿去卖给收废纸的，让有用的书籍拿去作纸浆或包糖果了。
    有些学校，往往一下买大批同类的书，特别是文艺书，而过后就闲置在书架上。像过去苏南工业专科学校就买了一百多部“远离莫斯科的地方”，不久就积压起来了。我建议有关部门考虑这个问题，来充分发挥书籍的作用。俞明德
    改进墨水的包装
    现在各地商业部门出售的墨水，每小瓶都有小纸盒包装。事实上不少顾主买来墨水以后，就把纸盒扔掉了。地方国营旅大文教用品厂生产的新文化科学墨水，小纸盒是用进口“马尼拉”和“白板”纸制的。这种纸每匹能裁剪一万二千二百五十个小盒，该厂每年至少要用二百多匹纸，开支七万多元。如果把全国各个墨水制造厂的包装纸全部加起来，数目就十分可观了。如果改善包装，不仅给国家节约资金，也减轻了消费者的负担，减轻了纸张供应的紧张状况。王福仁
