　　Paper on Polyploid Research Published
    (Our Dispatch) Polyploid researcher Bao Wenkui, in collaboration with Yan Yurui, has compiled research results on polyploid selection of cereal crops such as rice, barley, rye, and wheat-rye hybrids, which were at one time suspended. The research has been compiled into a paper titled "Homologous Polyploids and Double Diploids of Cereal Crops" and published as a special booklet by the Science Press. The authors point out that polyploid plants treated with colchicine have significant differences from diploid original species in terms of morphology, seeds, and physiological reactions. For example, the thousand-grain weight of tetraploid rice seeds is 60% higher than that of diploid original species, while tetraploid barley increases in weight by about 100%. The authors point out that the selection of polyploids is of great significance for increasing agricultural production, as it can greatly increase yields. At the same time, the authors also theoretically explored the problems existing in this work, such as low seed setting rate and insufficient seed plumpness, and proposed preliminary solutions.

　　研究多倍体的论文出版
    本报讯　多倍体研究者鲍文奎，现已同严育瑞合作，将一度被停止实验的有关水稻、大麦、黑麦和小麦—黑麦杂种等禾谷类作物的多倍体选种工作研究结果，整理成以“禾谷类作物的同源多倍体和双二倍体”为题的论文，由科学出版社印成专册出版。作者指出，用秋水仙硷处理后的多倍体植物，无论在形态上、种子上和生理反应上，都同二倍原种有显著的差异。如四倍体的水稻种子比二倍原种在千粒重量上增加百分之六十，四倍体的大麦则增加重量约一倍左右。作者指出，多倍体的选种工作，对提高农业的生产，有着重大意义，因为这将可使产量大大提高。同时，作者也对存于此项工作中的问题，如结实率低，种子不够饱满等，作了理论性的探讨，并提出了初步解决的办法。（高）
