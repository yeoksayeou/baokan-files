    Selling Vigilance
    Recently, the United Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic in Chengguan Town, Yanjin County, Yunnan, used a special kind of paper to wrap medicine. When opened, it turned out to be all membership cards of Communist Party members. How did this happen? It turned out that the Organization Department of the Yanjin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party sold a batch of membership cards of Communist Party members along with old newspapers as waste paper.
    These cadres, for an income of eight yuan, could even sell their vigilance along with them. (Li Ming)

    出卖警惕性
    最近，云南盐津县城关镇中医联合诊所用一种特殊的纸来包药，打开一看，竟都是党员介绍信。这是怎么一回事呢？原来中共盐津县委组织部把一批党员介绍信连同旧报纸一起当废纸卖掉了。
    这些干部为了八元钱的收入，就连警惕性也可以一齐出卖掉。　（黎明）
