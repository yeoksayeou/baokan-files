Tiantaishan Beacon on Mount Putuo
Li Ying

On the summit of Mount Putuo Island stands a beacon called Tiantaishan. Legend has it that a heavenly lantern once flickered here, burning day and night, protecting generations. Despite the constant incense burning beneath the lamp, fishermen still died at the hands of sea bandits and sea monsters. [Note] The cries of the fishermen drowned out the sea's roar, and their tears were deeper than the ocean.

But suddenly, the light went out. Now, on the Tiantaishan Beacon stand several soldiers, handsome and brave. Their eyes are now like true heavenly lanterns, watching day and night, protecting the fishing boats. They see through every nerve of the enemy. What can obscure the soldiers' eyes and the path of their bayonets?

There is no incense burning before the Tiantaishan Beacon, but even traveling ten thousand miles by sea, one knows who has created this happiness.

[Note] Fishermen often generally refer to pirates, fishing tyrants, etc. who run rampant at sea and oppress the people as "sea bandits" and "sea monsters."

　　普陀山天灯台
　　李瑛在普陀岛的山顶上，耸立着一座天灯台，传说，曾有盏天灯在这里萦萦闪动，日夜不熄，护佑百代。尽管灯下香火不断，渔人们仍然死给海匪、海怪，〔注〕渔民的哭声盖过海啸，渔民的眼泪深过大海。可从什么时候起忽然灯火熄灭，天灯台上站着几个士兵，英俊又威武，他们的眼睛才真像天灯，日夜在这里了望把渔船保护。他们望穿了敌人的每一根神经，有什么能遮住士兵的眼睛和刺刀的路？天灯台前没有一柱香火，船行万里，却知道是谁创造了幸福。
    〔注〕渔民对横行海上、欺压百姓的海盗、渔霸等，常泛称“海匪”“海怪”。
