Reporters Unable to Enter Port Said
By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun

The Anglo-French invading forces are still delaying their final withdrawal from Port Said, and creating various obstacles to prevent Egyptian and foreign reporters from entering Port Said. More than a hundred reporters from various countries were forced to return to Cairo today from El Ballah, 30 kilometers south of Port Said, because the British refused them entry into Port Said.

At the headquarters of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) in El Ballah, UNEF Commander General E.L.M. Burns of Canada, told reporters that the gates of Port Said were still in British hands, and he did not know when the last of the Anglo-French invading forces would withdraw. He merely said that he hoped to complete the withdrawal before Christmas. Cairo Radio reported that 5,000 British troops and 2,000 French troops were still stationed in Port Said. The people of Port Said are constantly attacking the invaders. Yesterday, there were twenty-six small skirmishes in this city of dilapidated walls.

Foreign reporters, including those from China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, Switzerland, India, Germany, Sudan, Finland, and many other countries, arrived in Ismailia yesterday evening together with a group of Egyptian reporters. We heard that the British military authorities insisted on receiving a list of the reporters and the newspapers or news agencies they represented twenty-four hours in advance, before allowing ten reporters to go to Port Said. At the same time, they announced that Egyptian reporters were not included. We also heard that they did not want reporters from China and the Soviet Union to go to Port Said either. Obviously, the Anglo-French invaders only want reporters they consider harmless to enter, to prevent the truth about the area from being exposed.

Some say that after submitting the list to the UNEF headquarters, we may be able to enter Port Said on Tuesday. But it is still uncertain whether all reporters or just ten reporters will be allowed in. The reporters are very indignant and protested against this restriction by the British invaders. Everyone decided to go to the UNEF headquarters in person on Monday morning to request permission to go to Port Said.

This morning, all the reporters went from Ismailia to El Ballah, hoping to have the opportunity to enter Port Said. It is only forty-five kilometers from Ismailia to El Ballah, with an asphalt road running parallel to the Suez Canal. Along the way, we saw thirteen oil tankers of different nationalities docked in the canal branch. We also saw the El Ferdan Bridge on the canal, which was destroyed by the invaders.

We passed through the camp of the Yugoslav troops and arrived at the UNEF headquarters. We were stopped at the gate. Two Canadian guards tried to push the reporters away. The reporters strongly protested. They then retreated and stood there glaring at us. After a while, the press officer of the headquarters, the Canadian Kim Gordon, came out. He said that apart from the ten reporters who had submitted their names yesterday, no other reporters could go to Port Said. This meant that everyone had to go back. We requested permission to go to the nearest British checkpoint near Port Said, to try our luck for a chance to enter the city. We would be responsible for our own safety. Gordon promised to discuss this with his colleagues, but soon replied that it was still not possible. At this time, several reporters selected by the British were successively called into the headquarters. Obviously, the UNEF headquarters intends to grant the privilege of covering Port Said to these people. All the reporters protested against this, demanding that all reporters go, or none at all. We requested to see General Burns.

Subsequently, the reporters were allowed to enter the camp of the headquarters. A delegation of six people was selected, and I was one of them. We met Burns in his office and requested that he allow us to go to Port Said. We said that there were more than a hundred reporters here, and it should not be just the selected ten people who go. We, including the Egyptian reporters, must go together, or no one goes. Burns said that even if there were thousands of reporters, he would not care, but it was futile to ask to go to Port Said, because the British still controlled the gateway to Port Said, and he could not give us any help. Then, he said that there were only three options: everyone goes, the reporters choose ten people to go, or the ten people who submitted their names yesterday go. This had to be decided by all the reporters. The reporters all agreed that either everyone goes together, or no one goes. A Canadian officer called this decision "mob mentality," which was immediately met with strong protests from the Egyptian reporters, causing him to blush and apologize.

While we were in Burns' office, an unexpected incident occurred on the camp. Officers of the UN forces attempted to arrest an Egyptian reporter and a Finnish reporter, on the pretext that they had violated safety rules by taking pictures in the camp. But under the angry protests of all the reporters, they regained their freedom.

Now it is clear that the road to Port Said is blocked, and we will not be able to get there before the Anglo-French invading forces withdraw. But heaven knows when they will really get out! After Burns held a short press conference, the reporters all returned to Cairo.

To the north, thirty kilometers away, Port Said is hidden behind the rolling sand dunes of the desert. The invaders are still clinging to it, even though they have announced their withdrawal by December 15. We reporters all demand that the Anglo-French forces immediately withdraw from Egyptian territory. (December 17)

### 记者进不了塞得港

    记者进不了塞得港
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    英法侵略军仍在拖延最后撤出塞得港，并制造了种种障碍来阻挠埃及和外国记者进入塞得港。一百多名各国记者，今天被迫从塞得港以南三十公里的艾尔巴拉返回开罗，因为英国人拒绝他们进入塞得港。
    在艾尔巴拉联合国紧急部队的司令部里，联合国紧急部队司令加拿大伯恩斯将军告诉记者说，塞得港的大门仍在英国人手里，他不知道最后一批的英法侵略军将在何时才撤走。他仅仅说，他希望能在圣诞节前撤完。开罗电台报道，在塞得港还驻有五千名英军和二千名法军。塞得港人民不断袭击侵略者。昨天，在这个颓墙断壁的城市里，有二十六次小交锋。
    外国记者，包括中国、苏联、美国、日本、瑞士、印度、德国、苏丹、芬兰和其他许多国家的记者，于昨日黄昏同一群埃及记者一起来到了伊士美利亚。我们听说英军事当局坚持要在二十四小时以前得到记者和他们所代表的报纸或通讯社的名单，然后才能让十名记者到塞得港。同时他们宣布，埃及记者不在此列。我们还听说，他们也不要中国和苏联的记者到塞得港。显然，英法侵略者只想让他们认为没有危险的记者进去，以防暴露该地的真相。
    有人说，在把名单送交联合国紧急部队司令部以后，我们也许能在星期二进入塞得港。但是还不能确定究竟是让所有的记者还是只让十名记者进去。记者们都很愤慨，并对英国侵略者的这种限制表示抗议。大家决定在星期一上午亲自到联合国紧急部队司令部要求允许去塞得港。
    今晨，全部记者都从伊士美利亚去到艾尔巴拉，希望能有机会进入塞得港。从伊士美利亚到艾尔巴拉仅四十五公里，有一条与苏伊士运河并行的柏油马路。我们沿途看到十三条不同国籍的油船停泊在运河支流里。还看到运河上为侵略者炸毁的菲尔丹桥。
    我们穿过南斯拉夫部队的营地，来到了联合国紧急部队司令部。在门口给止住了。两个加拿大卫兵想把记者们推开。记者们提出了强烈的抗议。于是他们退回去，站在那里瞪着我们。不一会，司令部的新闻官，加拿大人金·戈尔顿走出来。他说除了昨天先交名单的十名记者外，其他记者都不能去塞得港。这就是说，大家都得回去。我们请求允许到靠塞得港的最近的第一个英国检查哨去，试试看有无进城的机会。我们将为自己的安全负责。戈尔顿答应和他的同事商量这件事，但不久回答说还是不行。这时，经过英国人选择的几个记者，依次被召进司令部。显然，联合国紧急部队司令部打算把采访塞得港的特权给予这些人。全体记者都对此表示抗议，要求所有记者都去，否则就一个都不去。我们要求见伯恩斯将军。
    随后，记者们被允许进入司令部的营地。选出了一个六人的代表团，我是其中之一。我们在伯恩斯的办公室里会见了他，要求他让我们到塞得港去。我们说，我们一共有一百多位记者在此，不应该仅仅让经过选择的十个人去。我们，包括埃及记者，必须一同去，否则谁也不去。伯恩斯说，即使有成千上万个记者，他都无所谓，但是要求去塞得港是徒然的，因为英国人仍旧控制着塞得港的门户，他不能给我们什么帮助。接着，他又说，办法只有三个：全体都去，记者们自己选十个人去，或者让昨天先交名单的十个人去。这得由全体记者决定。记者们都同意要末大家一同去，否则一个也不去。一位加拿大军官把这个决定叫做“暴民心理”，顿时遭到了埃及记者的强烈抗议，使得他满面通红，只好表示道歉。
    当我们在伯恩斯的办公室里的时候，营地上发生了意外事件。联合国部队的军官企图逮捕一位埃及记者和一位芬兰记者，借口他们违犯了安全规则，在营内摄影。但在全体记者愤怒的抗议声中，他们恢复了自由。
    现在很清楚，塞得港去路不通，我们不可能在英法侵略军撤出以前到那儿了。但是，天知道他们究竟到什么时候才真的滚出去！在伯恩斯举行了一次短短的记者招待会后，记者们都回开罗去了。
    在北方，三十公里之外，塞得港隐藏在黄沙滚滚的河漠后面。侵略者还死赖在那儿，尽管他们已经宣布了在12月15日以前撤离。我们记者都要求英法军队立即撤出埃及领土。（12月17日）
