Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 11th -- Jiangxi Province recently convened a handicraft paper-making conference, formulating a three-year plan to restore the production of indigenous paper. According to this plan, the production of indigenous paper in Jiangxi Province will be restored from the current level of 300,000 dan per year to the historical peak of 1.2 million dan per year.

The plan stipulates specific measures for restoring and developing the production of indigenous paper. This work will be mainly led by the Provincial Department of Industry, in conjunction with the Handicraft Production Cooperative, Supply and Marketing Cooperative and other relevant units for overall planning, changing the previous state of no management.

The plan takes into account that the main raw material for papermaking, bamboo, is felled around the beginning of summer (立夏) each year, which coincides with the busy season of spring plowing and sowing. Therefore, it is proposed that during this period, labor and labor time must be rationally arranged to ensure that both agriculture and papermaking production are not hindered. In addition, the use of bamboo is expanding, while the growth of bamboo is limited. The agricultural department should strengthen the protection and cultivation of bamboo forests. At the same time, the use of rice straw, which is widely available, will be widely promoted for papermaking in the future.

The plan stipulates that the purchase price of indigenous paper will generally be appropriately adjusted in the future. Whether it is paper produced by handicraft production cooperatives or rural sideline industries, it can be sold independently or purchased by supply and marketing cooperatives. In order to enable producers to arrange production in a timely manner, the Agricultural Bank and the People's Bank will first provide producers with loans of 1 million yuan this December.

    江西计划增产土制纸
    新华社南昌11日电　江西省最近召开手工业造纸会议，拟订出恢复土制纸生产的三年计划。根据这个计划，江西省土制纸的生产将由现在年产三十万担的水平恢复到历史上最高年产一百二十万担的水平。
    计划规定了恢复和发展土制纸生产的具体办法。这项工作将以省工业厅为主，会同手工业生产联社、供销社及其它有关单位进行统筹安排，改变过去无人管理的状态。
    计划考虑到，造纸主要原料竹子的砍伐时间是每年的立夏前后，正值春耕春种农忙季节，因此提出在这期间必须合理安排劳动力和支配劳动时间，做到农业和造纸生产两不误。另外，竹子的用途日益扩大，而竹子的增长有限，农业部门要加强对竹山的保护和培植工作，同时，今后将普遍推广用来源很广的稻草来造纸。
    计划规定，今后土制纸的收购价格一般将作适当调整。不论是手工业生产合作社或者是农村副业出产的纸张；都可以自销，也可以由供销合作社选购。为了使生产者能够及时安排生产，今年12月份将由农业银行、人民银行先给生产者贷款一百万元。
