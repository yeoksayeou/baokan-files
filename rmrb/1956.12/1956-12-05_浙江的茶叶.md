　　Zhejiang is a well-known tea-producing area in the country. In 1933, the annual output of the province reached 500,000 dan (50,000 metric tons), with famous teas including Hangzhou's Dragon Well, Sui'an tea area's Mei tea, Pingshui's Pearl tea, and Wenzhou's black tea. During the Anti-Japanese War, tea sales were hindered, and tea gardens were abandoned. As a result, in 1949 at the time of liberation, the province's annual output was only 143,000 dan (14,300 metric tons), with a tea garden area of ​​over 310,000 mu (20,667 hectares).

　　After liberation, tea had a sales market, abandoned tea gardens were restored, and tea production and quality improved year by year. At present, the province has more than 989,000 mu (65,933 hectares) of tea gardens, distributed in 73 tea-producing counties and cities. This year's planned output is 460,000 dan (46,000 metric tons), more than three times that of 1949, and 92% of the highest annual output before the war. Judging from the increase in the national purchasing price of raw tea over the years, the quality of tea has also improved significantly.

　　At present, the tea produced in the province mainly falls into four categories, with pan-fried green tea (including Mei tea and Pearl tea) being the most abundant, accounting for about 54% of the total output; followed by baked green tea, accounting for about 26%; third is black tea, accounting for about 15%; and fourth is flat tea (including Dragon Well, Flag Gun, and Dafang tea), accounting for about 5%. Pan-fried green tea and black tea are both teas for export. Before liberation, they were mainly transported to countries such as Britain, the United States, and North Africa. At present, they are mainly transported to the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. Trade relations have also been established with Western European capitalist countries, and the North African market has gradually recovered. In addition, it has also expanded to Northern Europe, North America, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia. Domestic sales of green tea are even more popular all over the country. The tea produced in the six years after liberation, only the part operated by state-owned companies, if all of it could be organized for export, could be exchanged for 455,608 tons of steel, or 398,657 tons of steel rails; exchanging for steel rails could lay more than 4,600 kilometers of railways.

　　Zhejiang's natural conditions are conducive to tea tree cultivation. Tea trees have sufficient temperature and rainfall during the growing season, but the rainfall distribution is uneven. Generally, there is more rain in May and June, and drought is prone to occur from July to September. Tea trees generally grow on red soil and yellow soil, which are acidic and lack organic matter. Therefore, fertilization is the primary key to increasing tea production. Zhejiang tea trees are mostly distributed on mountains and hills below 800 meters, the highest Tiantai Mountain Yunwu tea grows on high mountains more than 900 meters high, but the famous Lion Peak Dragon Well tea producing area is only 240 meters high. According to farmers' experience, the leaves of high mountain tea in the same area are softer and thicker, less prone to aging, and the finished tea has a mellow taste, and a rich and lasting aroma.

　　Due to the long history of tea planting and suitable geographical conditions in Zhejiang, farmers have accumulated rich experience in tea planting and tea making. With the development of agricultural cooperation, the production level in some areas has improved. For example, in 1955, Yangjia Pailou Agricultural Cooperative in Liuxia Town, Hangzhou County, produced 7,441 jin (3,720.5 kilograms) of Flag Gun tea in more than 38 mu (2.53 hectares) of tea gardens, with an average output of more than 193 jin (96.5 kilograms) of dry tea per mu. In the same year, the October Tea Cooperative in Hangzhou had 15 mu (1 hectare) of high-yielding tea gardens, which achieved a record of an average output of 346 jin (173 kilograms) of Flag Gun tea per mu. This shows that the potential for increasing the unit area yield of tea is very large.

　　In the past few years after liberation, although Zhejiang Province has done some work in summarizing the advanced experience of the masses and promoting scientific and technological tea making, it has not done enough. For example, in terms of tea garden management, fertilization is still not common; soil and water conservation work is done poorly; weeding is not timely; in some areas, food crops are intercropped too much and too densely in tea gardens, especially after the unified purchase and sale of grain in 1953, the intercropping of tea gardens has increased, resulting in reduced tea production; tea tree diseases and insect pests have not been effectively curbed; tea tree pruning has not yet started. In terms of tea picking, many areas still adopt the backward picking method of "retaining the top to nourish the standard" (i.e., nourishing the top buds). The unextensive, infrequent, and uneven picking of summer and autumn tea is also an important reason for the slow increase in tea production.

　　The development prospects of Zhejiang tea are infinitely broad. According to the province's preliminary plan for tea production, by 1962, the tea garden area will be developed to 2.3 million mu (153,333 hectares); the output will reach 1.45 million dan (145,000 metric tons); and the tea output in 1967 will reach 3 million dan (300,000 metric tons). This task can be completed based on the progress of the province's restoration and development of tea gardens this year. This year, more than 155,000 mu (10,333 hectares) of new tea gardens have been developed, of which more than one-third have adopted strip sowing dense planting methods; 55,000 mu (3,667 hectares) of abandoned tea gardens have been restored; and the two items total more than 210,000 mu (14,000 hectares). The task of developing 200,000 mu (13,333 hectares) of tea gardens before the spring of this year was overfulfilled. We are fully confident and determined to realize this glorious task.

### 浙江的茶叶

　　浙江的茶叶
　　李联标
    浙江是全国有名的茶叶产区。1933年全省年产量曾达五十万担，著名的茶有杭州的龙井，遂淳茶区的眉茶，平水的珠茶，温州的红茶等。抗战时期，茶叶销路受阻，茶园荒芜，以至在1949年解放时，全省年产量仅有十四万三千多担，茶园面积三十一万多亩。
    解放后，茶叶有了销售市场，荒芜了的茶园得到恢复，茶叶产量、品质逐年提高。目前全省已有九十八万九千多亩茶园，分布在七十三个产茶县、市。今年的计划产量为四十六万担，相当于1949年的三倍多，为战前最高年产量的92％。茶叶的品质，从国家历年收购毛茶的价格上升幅度来看，也有显著的提高。
    目前全省生产的茶叶主要有四大类，以炒青绿茶（包括眉茶和珠茶）为最多，约占总产量的54％；其次是烘青绿茶，约占26％；第三是红茶，约占15％；第四是扁茶
  （包括龙井、旗枪及大方茶），约占5％。炒青绿茶和红茶，都是外销茶。解放以前，以运销英、美及北非等国家为主，目前则以运销苏联和新民主主义国家为主，和西欧资本主义国家也建立了贸易关系，北非市场也已逐渐有了恢复。此外，还扩大到北欧、北美、中亚及南洋等地。内销绿茶，更普及全国各地。解放后六年来生产的茶叶，仅国营公司经营的部分，如能全部组织出口，可换回钢材四十五万五千六百零八吨，或钢轨三十九万八千六百五十七吨；换回钢轨可铺四千六百多公里长的铁道。
    浙江的自然条件是有利于茶树栽培的，茶树在生长期内有足够的温度和雨量，但雨量分布还有不均匀的现象，一般是5、6两月份多雨，7至9月份容易发生干旱。茶树一般生长在红壤和黄壤上，土壤酸性，有机质比较缺乏，因此施肥是茶叶增产的首要关键。浙江茶树多分布在八百公尺以下的山地和丘陵地上，最高的天台山云雾茶生长在九百多公尺的高山，但著名的狮峰龙井茶产地高仅二百四十公尺。根据农民经验，在同一地区高山茶叶的叶质比较柔软厚实，不易变老，成茶滋味醇和，香气浓而长久。
    浙江由于种茶的历史悠久和地理条件的适宜，农民积累了丰富的栽茶和制茶经验；农业合作化的发展，部分地区生产水平有了提高。如1955年杭县留下镇杨家牌楼农业社在三十八亩多的采摘茶园内生产旗枪茶叶七千四百四十一斤，每亩合产干茶一百九十三斤多；同年在杭州市十月茶叶社有十五亩丰产茶园，达到了平均每亩产旗枪茶三百四十六斤的纪录。说明提高茶叶单位面积产量的潜在力很大。
    解放后几年来浙江省虽然在总结群众先进经验、推广制茶科学技术方面做了一些工作，但是做得很不够。如在茶园管理方面，施肥还很不普遍；水土保持工作做得很差；中耕除草尚不及时；部分地区茶园间种粮食作物过多、过密，特别是1953年粮食统购统销以后，茶园间种更有增涨的趋势，因此造成茶叶减产；茶树病虫害还未得到有效的遏止；茶树修剪工作尚未展开。在茶叶采摘方面，还有不少地区是采用“留顶养标”（即养顶芽）的落后采摘方法。夏、秋茶采摘不广、不多，也不平衡，也是茶叶增产缓慢的一个重要原因。
    浙江茶叶的发展前途是无限广阔的，全省茶叶生产的初步规划，到1962年，茶园面积发展到二百三十万亩；产量达到一百四十五万担；1967年的茶叶产量达到三百万担。这个任务根据今年全省在恢复和发展茶园的进度来看是可以完成的。今年新发展的茶园已有十五万五千多亩，其中有三分之一以上采用了条播密植法；恢复荒芜茶园五万五千多亩；两项共达二十一万多亩。超额完成今年春季以前计划发展二十万亩茶园的任务。我们完全有信心，有决心来实现这个光荣的任务。
