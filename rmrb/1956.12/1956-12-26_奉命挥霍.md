Title: Ordered to Squander

From late November, the agricultural and forestry bureaus of various counties under the Xingtai Special District in Hebei were extremely busy. What were they busy with? It wasn't busy with year-end summaries, nor was it busy rushing to complete the work that should have been done this year, but busy spending the remaining money. The agricultural and forestry bureaus of Nangong, Qinghe, and Pingxiang counties each used their surplus funds to buy a "three-purpose" radio, but the money was still not used up. So, the Qinghe County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau sent people to Beijing to buy compass instruments; Pingxiang County sent people to buy cameras; and Nangong County planned to buy coffee tables and instruments. The Xingtai County Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, seeing that the surplus money would be turned over to the national treasury in just over half a month, hurriedly drafted a budget on December 14, planning to use 389 yuan to buy materials for the nursery, preparing to build a house next year. Because the budget was too small, the money still couldn't be spent, so the next day they asked the county finance section for funds, planning to buy a few more vehicles. Other agricultural and forestry bureaus, such as those in Ningjin, Baixiang, Renxian, Xinhe, and Lincheng counties, also rushed to use their surplus funds to purchase things that were not urgently needed.

Perhaps some people would find it strange that their superiors could allow them to "crash" spend money so openly? However, things are beyond common sense. It turns out that the agricultural and forestry bureaus of various counties under the Xingtai Special District were spending money so hastily under the instructions of their superiors - the Xingtai Special Commissioner's Office of Agriculture and Forestry Bureau. On November 15, the Xingtai Special Commissioner's Office of Agriculture and Forestry Bureau issued a notice to the agricultural and forestry bureaus of its subordinate counties. The notice severely criticized the county (city) agricultural and forestry bureaus that had failed to spend their money in previous years, resulting in large surpluses, and required the lower-level agricultural and forestry bureaus to "do detailed accounting so that they know exactly how much money they have. According to the funding situation, urgent matters can be handled quickly, so as to avoid the trouble of handing it over this year and re-applying for it next year."

It seems that the Xingtai Special Commissioner's Office of Agriculture and Forestry Bureau is "well-intentioned," afraid of increasing the "trouble of re-applying next year" for its subordinates; however, unfortunately, when they issued the notice, they did not think about the country: under such a "notice," how much national wealth will be wasted!

    奉命挥霍
    从11月下旬起，河北邢台专区所属各县农林局显得十分忙碌。他们在忙些什么呢？原来既不是在忙着做年终总结，也不是在忙着把今年应该做完的工作赶完，而是在忙着把结余下来的钱花完。南宫、清河、平乡三县农林局各自用结余款项买了一架
  “三用”收音机，钱还是用不完。于是，清河县农林局又派人到北京去买罗盘仪器；平乡县派人去买照像机；南宫县则计划买茶几和仪器。邢台县农林局眼看再有半个多月结余的钱就要上交国库了，在12月14日慌忙赶制了一项预算，计划用三百八十九元给苗圃站买料，准备明年盖房。因为预算太小，钱还是花不完，第二天他们又要求县财政科拨款，计划再买几辆车子。其他如宁晋、柏乡、任县、新河、临城各县农林局，也急急忙忙的把结余款项用来购买并不急需的东西。
    也许有人会奇怪，他们这样公然的“突击”花钱，难道他们的上级能够容许么？可是，事情偏偏超出常理之外，原来邢台专区所属各县农林局这样急急忙忙地花钱，是在他们的上司——邢台专署农林局的指示下进行的。11月15日，邢台专署农林局给所属各县农林局发出了一个通知。通知在严厉地批评了历年花不净钱、造成大量结余的县（市）农林局后，要下级农林局“通过详细算账，做到心中有数，根据经费情况需办的可急速办理，以免今年上缴明年再造的麻烦。”
    看来，邢台专署农林局倒是一片“好心”，害怕增加下级“明年再造的麻烦”；但是，可惜的是他们在发通知的时候，竟没有为国家着想着想：在这样一个“通知”下，又将浪费国家多少财富呵！（附图片）
