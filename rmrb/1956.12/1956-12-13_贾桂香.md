    Jia Guixiang
    Shao Yanxiang
The white clouds in the sky flutter like headscarves,
On the ground, a happy girl walks briskly,
Her eyes darting east and west,
Her long braids swaying back and forth,
Does this place look like your hometown?
The vegetable leaves are emerald green, the flowers golden,
Juicy to the touch, absorbing the sunlight…
Life is even broader than this field,
Imagination even wider than this road!
Believing in people like this, so confident:
“Sixteen years old, surname Jia, name Guixiang!”
Her dark face tanned red,
From temporary worker to permanent employee;
Forever working on the demonstration farm, how wonderful,
Working well, not just for praise.
When writing to sisters in the same village,
Will she mention being the production team leader?
Since before the 1954 National Day,
Little Jia is no longer just a girl outside the Youth League.
Could there still be worries in the world,
Could there still be misfortune, Jia Guixiang?
Uncle Sun always treats Little Jia like a child,
Not at all like a manager to a team leader;
After meetings at night, riding his bike to take her home,
Just like carrying his own daughter.
He loves to chat and laugh with young people,
Young people love to tell him their stories.
But there is only one sentence that is really annoying:
“Little Jia, would you like Uncle to find you a partner?”
Originally it was to care for this girl,
Unexpectedly, it harmed this girl.
It wasn’t that Uncle Sun picked the wrong partner,
Nor did he disturb the girl’s thoughts;
Even if Uncle Sun had a thousand mouths,
He could no longer clear Little Jia’s name—
“That little girl is with you all day,
Your relationship must be improper…”
The rumors are just a gust of wind, a cloud,
The criticism at the meeting woven into a net.
What kind of net is this,
Covering Jia Guixiang without rhyme or reason.
The calluses on her palms are getting thicker,
Tears flowing silently down her back,
Little Jia silently works and works,
She is no longer the production team leader.
Not getting the red flag, blaming Jia Guixiang,
Picking the wrong eggplant seedlings, blaming Jia Guixiang,
Not knowing why, hating Jia Guixiang,
Team leader Geng Chengmei suppresses Jia Guixiang.
All the mistakes that no one wants to take responsibility for,
Are all attributed to this innocent girl.
At this time, only the young husband cares for you,
With the heart of a worker;
Waiting for you by the stove every night,
Not letting you eat that cold rice and cold soup again,
The fatigue of working overtime for eleven hours is all forgotten in a moment of warmth.
If only everyone who should care for others could be like him!…
Who would have thought this affection between husband and wife,
Would increase your guilt, Jia Guixiang!
“Not loving labor, not cooking for your lover.”
The Youth League branch asks you to examine your thoughts.
Yes, in the motherland, labor is glorious,
That’s what the elementary school textbooks say.
But who gives them the right
To force a pregnant woman to carry heavy baskets?
Jia Guixiang, Jia Guixiang is tired, tired,
Often falling asleep on the damp vegetable field…
She is our comrade and sister,
Jia Guixiang, just twenty years old.
Jia Guixiang is a Youth League member,
And the Youth League cadres treat her like this!
Jia Guixiang is a farm worker,
Wiping away her tears, she goes to find Farm Manager Wang Lu.
The farm manager is only allowed to criticize one, two, three points,
Not listening to Little Jia explain a single thing,
“If you have any opinions, take them to my superiors!”
The farm manager slams the table.
“Okay, I’ll take them!”
If only you had taken your opinions to the higher-ups, Jia Guixiang!
You were stopped by the Youth League secretary at the threshold,
You shouldn’t have stopped at this step!
How can you write a self-criticism if you haven't made a mistake,
Half the night passes and it is still a blank sheet.
At this time, you shouldn’t let tears drown your heart,
You should pour out all the grievances in your chest,
You should have written all of this,
Wrote to our country, our Party.
I cannot bear to write the following line,
China should not have such a premature death.
Little Ga was only nine years old in 1945,
The little girl thirteen years old in 1949,
How much happiness should have been waiting for her,
How many passionate, joyful times!
What kind of headwind extinguished the newly lit flame?
A place where she could fly freely in the vast sky,
Broke the wings that had just spread!
Tell me, answer me:
What kind of, what kind of hand,
Strangled Jia Guixiang!?

    Postscript: Jia Guixiang, a young female worker at the Jiamusi Horticultural Demonstration Farm, unable to withstand the encirclement and suppression by subjectivists and bureaucrats, committed suicide on July 27. Comrade Wang Ge, a reporter from the Heilongjiang Daily, wrote an investigation report, which was published in the Heilongjiang Daily on October 11. Reading it made my heart pound, so I wrote this poem to call out: Let there be no second Jia Guixiang!

    贾桂香
    邵燕祥天上的白云像头巾飘荡，地上疾走着快活的姑娘，眼珠儿东望西望，长辫子前晃后晃，看这儿像不像你的家乡？菜叶叶翠绿，菜花金黄，掐得出水来，吸收着阳光……生活比这原野还要辽阔，幻想比这大路还要宽广！这样相信人，这样自信：“十六岁了，姓贾，叫桂香！”黝黑的脸蛋晒得透了红，临时工转成了固定工；永远在示范农场工作多美，工作好，可不单为了赞扬。写信给同村姐妹的时候，说不说担任了生产小队长？打从1954年国庆节前夕，小贾也不再是团外的姑娘。世界上难道还会有烦恼，还会有不幸吗，贾桂香？孙大叔老把小贾当成小孩，一点不像管理员对小队长；晚上散会，骑车载着她回家，就跟载着自己的女儿一样。他爱跟年轻人说说笑笑，年轻人爱跟他道短说长。可是只有一句话真讨厌：“小贾，求不求大叔给找个对象？”本来是疼爱这个姑娘，想不到害了这个姑娘。不是孙大叔给挑错了对象，也不是扰乱了姑娘的思想；哪怕孙大叔生一千张嘴，再也辩不清小贾的冤枉——“小丫头成天跟你在一块，你们的关系一定不正当……”流言还只是一阵风，一片云，会上的批评织成一张网。这是怎样的一张网呵，没头没脑罩住贾桂香。手心上茧子又厚了一层，手背止不住眼泪暗淌，小贾默默地干活干活，她已经不是生产小队长。得不到红旗，怨贾桂香，挑错了茄秧，怪贾桂香，不知为什么，恨贾桂香，队长耿成美打击贾桂香。所有没人承担的错误，全归了这个无辜的姑娘。这时候只有年轻的丈夫体贴着你，用工人的心肠；天天晚上在炉灶旁等你，不让你再吃那冷饭凉汤，加班到十一小时的劳累全都在温暖的一刻遗忘。所有应该关心人的人要是全都能像他一样！……谁想到这夫妻的情分，竟给你加重了罪过，贾桂香！“不爱劳动，不给爱人做饭。”团支部叫你检查思想。是呵，在祖国，劳动光荣，小学的课本上就这样讲。但是谁给他们这种权利强逼着孕妇硬抬大箩筐？贾桂香，贾桂香累了，累了，常常睡倒在潮湿的菜地上……她是我们的同志和姐妹，刚刚二十岁的贾桂香。贾桂香是个青年团员，青年团的干部待她这样！贾桂香是个农场工人，擦擦眼泪去找王禄场长。只许场长批评一二三点，不听小贾说明半点情况，“有意见找我的上级提去！”场长把桌子拍得山响。“好，我去提！”如果你向上级去提意见多好呵，贾桂香！你被团支书拦在门坎上，你不该就停在这一步上！没错误怎么能写检讨呵，半宿过去还是白纸一张。这时候你不该让眼泪淹心，该把满腔的委屈掏出胸膛，你本该写出所有这一切，写给我们的国家、我们的党。我不忍落下这下面一笔，中国不该有这样的夭亡。1945年只有九岁的小嘎，1949年十三岁的小姑娘，等待她的该有多少幸福，多少火热的欢乐的时光！到底是怎样的一股逆风扑灭了刚刚燃点的火焰？海阔天空任飞翔的地方，折断了刚刚展开的翅膀！告诉我，回答我：是怎样的，怎样的手，扼杀了贾桂香！？
    后记：佳木斯园艺示范农场青年女工贾桂香，受不住主观主义者和官僚主义者的围剿，在7月27日自杀，黑龙江日报记者王戈同志写有调查记，登在10月11日黑龙江日报上。读之心怦怦然，因写这首诗呼吁：不许再有第二个贾桂香！
