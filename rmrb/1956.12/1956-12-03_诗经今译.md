Modern Translations of the Book of Songs
　　Lan Jusun
    "Tuo Xi" (Zheng Feng)
      (1) The leaves in the wilderness have fallen one after another, gusts of autumn wind sweep over them. My adorable Uncle Brother [Note]! When I sing, you harmonize with me!
    [Note] Uncle is her lover's name
      (2) The trees in the wilderness have fallen one after another, gusts of autumn wind blow over them. My adorable Uncle Brother! When I dance, you learn from me!
    Original:
      (1) ? Xi ? Xi, the wind blows on you. Uncle Xi, Brother Xi!
    Sing, and I will harmonize!
      (2) ? Xi ? Xi, the wind drifts you. Uncle Xi, Brother Xi!
    Sing, and I will follow!
    "Sly Boy" (Zheng Feng)
      (1) You sly boy, you are so annoying! Why don't you talk to me? Just because of you, I can't swallow my food!
      (2) You sly boy, you are so annoying! Why don't you eat with me? Just because of you, I can't sleep in peace!
    Original:
      (1) That sly boy! He won't talk to me! Because of you,
    I can't eat!
      (2) That sly boy! He won't eat with me! Because of you,
    I can't rest!
    "Raising the Skirt" (Zheng Feng)
      (1) If you truly love me wholeheartedly, I will lift my skirt and cross the Zhen River with you immediately; if you are always fickle and unpredictable, can't I find other boys? You sly boy, you are really hard to figure out!
      (2) If you truly love me wholeheartedly, I will lift my skirt and cross the Wei River with you immediately; if you are always fickle and unpredictable, can't I find other lads? You sly boy, you are really hard to figure out!
    Original:
      (1) If you kindly think of me, I will lift my skirt and cross the Zhen; if you don't think of me, wouldn't there be others? What madness is this mad boy!
      (2) If you kindly think of me, I will lift my skirt and cross the Wei; if you don't think of me, wouldn't there be other men? What madness is this mad boy!

    “蘀兮”（郑风）
      （一）原野上树叶已纷纷脱落，股股秋风从它身上掠过。我那逗人的叔伯〔注〕哥儿呵！我唱起歌来您就来相和！
    〔注〕叔伯是她情人的名字
      （二）原野上树木已纷纷脱落，股股秋风从它身上刮过。我那逗人的叔伯哥儿呵！我跳起舞来您就跟我学！原文：
      （一）?兮?兮，风其吹女。叔兮伯兮！
    倡予和女！
      （二）?兮?兮，风其漂女。叔兮伯兮！
    倡予要女！
    “狡童”　（郑风）
      （一）您这个小滑头真是可厌！为了啥事不和我言谈？就是为了您的缘故，害得我饮食难咽！
      （二）您这个小滑头真是可厌！为了啥事不和我吃饭？就是为了您的缘故，害得我睡觉不安！原文：
      （一）彼狡童兮！不与我言兮？维子之故，
    使我不能餐兮！
      （二）彼狡童兮！不与我食兮？维子之故，
    使我不能息兮！
    “褰裳”　（郑风）
      （一）如果您真是死心塌地爱我，我牵着裙子马上就跟您渡过溱河；若老是三心二意不可捉摸，难道我找不到其他的男孩啰？您这个小滑头真有些难说！
      （二）如果您真是死心塌地爱我，我牵着裙子马上就跟您渡过洧河；若老是三心二意不可捉摸，难道我找不到其他的儿郎啰？您这个小滑头真有些难说！原文：
      （一）子惠思我，褰裳涉溱；子不我思，岂无他人？狂童之狂也且！
      （二）子惠思我，褰裳涉洧；子不我思，岂无他士？狂童之狂也且！
