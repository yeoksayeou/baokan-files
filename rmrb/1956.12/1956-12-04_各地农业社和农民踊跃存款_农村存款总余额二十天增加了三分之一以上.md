Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd -- Since entering the peak season, agricultural cooperatives and farmers in various regions, after selling surplus grain and cash crops, have been actively depositing money and repaying maturing loans at credit cooperatives or banks. According to statistics from the Agricultural Bank of China: in the first twenty days of November, the total balance of rural savings nationwide increased from more than 470 million yuan at the end of October to more than 630 million yuan, an increase of over one-third. Among these, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Liaoning provinces saw faster increases. During this period, the total balance of rural loans nationwide decreased by nearly 40 million yuan, with Shandong, Henan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces recovering the most loans.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, December 1st -- Shandong Province has had a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year, and rural savings have greatly increased. By the end of November, the province's rural savings had reached more than 73 million yuan, an increase of more than 150% over the same period last year.

In carrying out savings work, credit cooperatives in Shandong ensure that deposits are voluntary and withdrawals are free, and they adopt many methods to facilitate farmers' savings. The "fixed time, fixed location, fixed route" mobile service method has been widely implemented throughout the province. In many areas, credit cooperatives have set up "service contact boxes" or "farmer problem boxes" in each village, issuing contact cards to each household. When farmers want to deposit or withdraw money, they simply put the contact card into the box, and the credit cooperative cadres will come to their door to handle the procedures. This method is very popular with the masses.

　　各地农业社和农民踊跃存款
　　农村存款总余额二十天增加了三分之一以上
    新华社3日讯　进入旺季以来，各地农业社和农民在出售余粮和经济作物后，纷纷到信用合作社或银行存款和归还到期贷款。据中国农业银行总行的统计：在11月的前二十天中，全国农村存款的总余额已由10月底的四亿七千多万元上升到六亿三千多万元，增加了三分之一以上，其中以河北、山东、河南、辽宁等省增加较快。在这个时期内，全国农村放款的总余额共下降了将近四千万元，收回贷款较多的是山东、河南、湖南、湖北等省。
    据新华社济南1日电　山东省今年粮棉丰收，农村储蓄大有增加。到11月底，全省农村储蓄额达到了七千三百多万元，比去年同期增加一倍半以上。
    山东各地信用合作社在开展储蓄工作中，做到存款自愿，取款自由，并且采用很多办法来便利农民储蓄。“定时、定点、定线”流动服务的办法，已经在全省普遍实行。许多地区的信用合作社以村为单位，设置“服务联络箱”或“农民有事箱”，每户发给联络证，农民存款取款的时候，只要把联络证投入箱内，信用合作社的干部就登门去办理手续。这种办法很受群众欢迎。
