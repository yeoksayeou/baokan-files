Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, December 14th: The Eighth Mechanical Installation Company of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, adhering to the principle of taking full responsibility for national construction projects, mobilized its employees to complete the finishing work at the Jilin Fertilizer Plant.

From May to October of this year, the company installed a large amount of equipment and pipelines at the Jilin Fertilizer Plant. However, it was later discovered that many "tails" were left unfinished on some of the installed equipment, affecting the commissioning. For example, some equipment was missing screws, some lacked power supplies, and some had not been painted or corrosion-proofed.

In light of the above situation, in early November, as the equipment installation work entered its final stages, the company convened a Party Congress and decided to mobilize the masses to complete the finishing work and ensure that the equipment was delivered as early as possible. After the meeting, the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League held separate meetings to criticize the erroneous thinking of some employees who felt that the project was piecemeal and were unwilling to work on it, being eager to move on to new projects. It was repeatedly explained that they should take full responsibility for national construction and that the early completion of this fertilizer plant would support the development of agricultural production.

The company's administrative side also, in accordance with the spirit of the Party Congress, corrected the practice of one-sidedly emphasizing the completion of work volume, stipulating that the completion of engineering projects should be the main indicator for calculating engineering progress. The wage calculation method for some employees was also changed from piecework to hourly pay, ensuring that they could receive reasonable compensation during this stage.

These efforts by the Party and government leaders of the company mobilized the enthusiasm of the employees. Competition between construction sites, engineering teams, work sections, and groups quickly unfolded. During the competition, leading cadres also went deep into the construction sites and promptly promoted many good construction methods discovered among the masses. For example, when acetylene gas generators of some construction site gas welders froze, union cadres discovered that a gas welding team had created a set of insulation methods and immediately organized gas welders throughout the company to learn from them. Some long-unresolved technical problems were solved after the masses were widely mobilized. Currently, the finishing work has completed 1,700 large and small tasks, and many pieces of equipment will soon be tested.

### 对工程负责到底  化工部第八机械安装公司重视收尾工程

    对工程负责到底
    化工部第八机械安装公司重视收尾工程
    新华社吉林14日电　化学工业部第八机械安装公司坚持对国家建设工程负责到底的原则，发动职工群众做好了吉林肥料厂的收尾工程。
    这个公司在今年5月到10月间，给吉林肥料厂安装了大量设备和管道。但是后来发现，在已经安装的一些设备上拖了很多“尾巴”，影响了交工试车。例如有的设备上缺螺丝，有的少电源，有的没有刷油、防腐。
    根据以上情况，11月初当设备安装工作进入收尾阶段的时候，这个公司召开了党代会，决定发动群众做好完工收尾工作，保证设备尽早交工。会后，党、政、工、团分别召开会议，批判了当时部分职工认为工程零零碎碎，不愿意干，急于转到新工程上去施工等错误思想，并且反复地说明对国家建设应该负责到底，和提前建成这个肥料厂支援发展农业生产的意义。
    公司行政方面也根据党代会精神，纠正片面地强调完成工作量的做法，规定以完成工程项目作为计算工程进度的主要指标。部分职工的工资计算方法也由计件改为计时，保证他们在这一阶段能得到合理的报酬。
    公司党、政领导方面的这些工作，动员了职工群众的积极性。工地、工程队、工段和小组相互之间的竞赛很快地开展起来了。竞赛中，领导干部又深入工地，把在群众中发现的许多好的施工方法，及时加以推广。如有些工地气焊工的乙炔气发生罐结冻，工会干部发现有一个气焊工小组创造出一套保暖方法，立即组织全公司气焊工去学习。有些长期没有解决的施工技术问题，在广泛发动群众之后得到了解决。现在，收尾工程已经完成了大小一千七百处，很多设备很快就要试车了。
