　　The Calamity of Meetings, the Curse of Paperwork
　　Rèn Zhōnghào
    Old Problem
    "Management lags behind production" has been a common complaint in industrial enterprises for a long time. Despite the complaints, the problem of lagging behind has not been solved. Is it that management should lag behind production and cannot be fundamentally solved? Or is it possible to solve but the fundamental solution has not been found? I believe it is the latter, not the former.
    Does management lagging behind production mean that the organization is unsound? Our factories have all the departments that Soviet enterprises have, and we cannot set up more organizations. Is it that there are not enough personnel? In our factory, the total number of technical personnel and staff accounts for 17.4% of the total number of employees, which is already a large proportion. Is it that the quality of technical personnel and staff is too low? Among these personnel in our factory, Party members account for 50%, while worker Party members account for only 14%. Their scientific and cultural level is certainly much higher than that of workers, and they understand the principles of Marxism-Leninism better than workers. Although their management skills cannot be said to be high, they basically know the principles, methods, and systems of socialist enterprise management, and many people know them in detail. Is it that the responsibilities are not clear? The division of labor in the departments is very detailed, and the name of each department represents its responsibilities. Moreover, the regulations for the responsibilities of the departments are available, and everyone has studied them many times. Although the detailed rules for each staff member have not yet been formulated, the responsibilities are basically clear. Is it that the department staff are not active, responsible, and do not work hard? That is not the case either. Most comrades are very active and work hard, and their working hours are longer than those of workers. This is not to say that the above is perfect, and there are some problems to varying degrees, but these are not the most fundamental reasons why management lags behind production.
    Management serves production, and all management work is to develop production. All management organizations and personnel should discover and solve the problems that occur and are raised in production at all times. If the problems are not solved, it cannot be considered management. To solve problems, we must first discover them. Where are the problems? Production problems are in production activities, not in offices and on conference tables; real production problems are in living production practice, and cannot be fully reflected by forms and reports. To discover problems, we must go deep into production and contact reality. But what is the situation now? Most of the time of our leaders and department staff is not spent going deeper into production and contacting reality, but is consumed in offices and on conference tables. Endless empty discussions and voluminous documents and reports replace vivid and practical on-site observations and specific guidance. Meetings follow one after another, and reports are linked one after another, but the problems that need to be solved in production are waiting one after another. The problem lies here, and the fundamental reason lies here. The calamity of meetings, the curse of paperwork – this is the crux of the matter, this is the root cause of management lagging behind production, leadership lagging behind the masses, and thinking lagging behind reality.
    Countless Meetings
    I am a factory director, and I have consulted many Soviet advisors and experts: how can I be a good factory director? They all answered in unison, "The factory director must go to the workshop every day to understand the production situation and check the work."
    But I am indeed too ashamed. Not to mention every day, I cannot even go down once a week. Then, where do the eight hours a day go? Browsing and stamping documents and reports from above and below also takes an hour; various meetings within the factory take at least four hours on average every day; talking to the production manager about production problems and understanding the production situation takes an hour; the remaining two hours for arranging work and handling daily business are often not enough. Once a week, we have to listen to the work report of the workshop and department (one day), write a work bulletin (half a day), and talk to Soviet experts about work (half a day). On average, we attend city meetings or reports for two days a month, and accompany leaders or guests to visit the factory at least one day a month (which becomes an opportunity to go to the workshop), write a work report to the higher authorities once a month (one day), and conduct a competition evaluation once a month (half a day). Every year, we spend a month and a half in Beijing or the province for meetings, and two and a half months off-the-job studying theory. The above can be listed in the budget, and there are many more outside the budget! Many tasks assigned by the higher authorities are often "the factory director is responsible, do it yourself" and "report the implementation." When people from higher authorities come to the factory to handle affairs, even if they are just a staff member, because they come from higher authorities, they often have to talk to the factory director. When workers have problems that the departments and workshops have not solved well, they have to find the factory director in the end. The work plan and summary for each period must be reported to the cadres. Some important conferences require a speech to show the importance of leadership. There are also many reports and lectures.
    In short, countless meetings and reports, countless hours sitting in a chair. Is the situation better below? It is also similar. Some people think of holding a meeting, and holding a meeting has simply become the main method of carrying out work, as if work cannot be carried out without a meeting, and they pull many people who are even slightly related to the meeting. Many meetings are neither prepared nor have a center, and when they start, they talk about everything, empty and meaningless, wasting time.
    Truly necessary meetings must be held. But if we examine our meetings, most of them are about passing down information, and there is very little discussion of issues from the masses and from production. This situation is more serious the higher up you go. One thing after another is passed down, and the people below can only parry and have no power to fight back. Just passing down, thinking that everything will be fine after passing down, without checking the implementation and understanding the problems that arise in the implementation, how can this approach not lead to right-leaning conservative thinking! Right-leaning conservative thinking is not seeing new things. Where are new things? Aren't they in the constantly developing and changing production, rather than quietly placed on the conference table! We shout loudly every day at the conference table to overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, but it is precisely these people sitting at the conference table who are the actual right-leaning conservatives. Despite our high-sounding talk, new things will not wait for us to adjourn the meeting before they happen and develop, and fresh fish will never be picked up on the beach.
    Submerged in Reports
    The biggest distress of the main leading cadres is meetings, so what is the biggest distress of the general staff? The answer is: paperwork and unreasonable systems, unnecessary procedures, and too many reports that no one reads.
    Our enterprise has a total of sixty-six kinds of reports to be submitted (this has been streamlined many times), with a total of seven hundred and ninety-two submissions annually, and four hundred and ten kinds of internal reports. According to incomplete statistics, if the paper used for these reports each year is unfolded, the area is about 200,000 square meters, the weight is about ten tons, and the cost of paper, pens, ink, and printing is 45,000 yuan. No one cares about this, and no one wants to manage it. However, if a worker puts forward a rationalization proposal or a measure needs to be taken in production, or a Soviet expert puts forward a proposal, assuming that the required cost is more than 200 yuan and it is not included in the annual plan, then the processing procedure for this matter according to the current system will be as follows: workshop review, process section review, transfer to the planning section, transfer to the infrastructure section, apply for additional infrastructure plan, bureau approval, infrastructure section transfer to the planning section, issue manufacturing order, manufacturing unit receive materials, manufacture, complete cancellation order, receive and use, a total of twelve major procedures, dozens of minor procedures; the cycle? According to convention, it will take two months excluding manufacturing time, and if something goes wrong in the middle, it is not known how long it will take.
    According to regulations, the purchase of items worth more than 200 yuan must be listed as fixed assets and included in the basic construction plan at the beginning of the year. There are too many things worth more than 200 yuan in the enterprise. Buying a good micrometer or dial indicator exceeds 200 yuan, not to mention rationalization proposals worth more than 200 yuan, which cannot be planned at the beginning of the year. Major repair costs are extracted according to depreciation, and this money is not used up every year, not because it is not needed, but because it is not allowed to be used, because there are several regulations for major repairs, and the major repair fee cannot be used if it does not meet one of them. Although these regulations are well-considered, they still cannot cover all complex situations, and if it is not included in the annual plan, it cannot be paid at all. Therefore, although the money is in the bank, the problem is still there and cannot be solved. A plan must be in place, because socialism is a planned economy, but the plan cannot leave no room for activity at all. A plan is a prediction, and a prediction is not equal to the result. Even the most brilliant planner cannot plan the whole year's affairs down to the smallest detail at the beginning of the year. Now, many things are handled too much from above, restricted too much, and the lower levels are not given a free hand. There are too many unnecessary submissions for approval.
    Speaking of planning, it is also a painful thing. The enterprise's "production technology and financial plan" is compiled five times a year, the annual plan once, and the quarterly plan four times. To compile an annual plan, in addition to all the staff of the planning section, relevant personnel from other departments and workshops must also be organized, totaling about 100 people, and it takes two months to compile. Compiling a quarterly plan also takes almost a month. Every month, economic indicators are also issued to each workshop and the completion of their accounting is calculated. In this way, more than half of the year is spent compiling plans, and the planning section has become a veritable "planning" section. In theory, the planning section should spend a small amount of time compiling plans, and most of the time organizing and checking the implementation of plans, and promoting intra-factory economic accounting. But now most of their time is spent sitting in the office compiling plans, and after compiling one plan, they compile another. In addition to the various reports that are frequently submitted, most people are almost always active on paper all year round and cannot go deep to investigate the actual economic activity. How can such economic planning work play a role in improving management? I think the annual plan should be compiled well, and the quarterly plan can be completely eliminated, so that a large amount of manpower can be liberated from paper and engaged in meaningful work in actual production and economic activities.
    Must Change Style
    Many facts show that the style in the organs needs to be improved. People who design forms and issue instructions often do not know the "suffering of the people." Adding a sentence more to a document or adding a column more to a form does not know how much hard work tens of thousands of people have to pay for it! A report often cannot be approved for several months. You are as anxious as fire here, and he is as stable as Mount Tai there. The lower levels want things from the upper levels, some are given, and some tell you to "find a way to overcome difficulties"; the upper levels want things from the lower levels, even if there are great difficulties, if they are not given or given slowly, they will be subject to some criticism. Many reports are required, and some are required very urgently, but many are silent after they are reported.
    In order to overcome these shortcomings, we have made some efforts. In the past, in implementing the Party's policy of relying on the working class to run enterprises well, there was a serious shortcoming of neglecting to rely on technicians and staff. In recent years, the inappropriate emphasis on the system of one leader and the incorrect understanding of the system of one leader, to some extent, the system of one leader has become a handicraft style and patriarchal leadership, weakening collective wisdom and organizational role. This year, we paid attention to strengthening department work by mobilizing the masses and relying on the masses. For two months, it has been effective. We have launched the advanced workers movement in the department, organized business competitions in the department and socialist competitions between departments and individuals; implemented the reward system for department personnel; mobilized department personnel to go to the workshop to check work, solve problems, and improve management; established the necessary leadership meetings and mass meetings system, and planned and checked work on time. In this way, everyone's enthusiasm has been aroused. In the past, many problems that needed to be solved by the factory director were solved by the section chief, and many unreasonable systems and unnecessary procedures began to be improved by everyone. Now the problem is that the leadership meetings have not been reduced, there is still a lot of paperwork, and there is still too little time to go down to deeply study production and deeply study the masses. This problem must be resolved with determination; but this determination must be made by everyone, and everyone must work together from top to bottom to eliminate disasters and destroy misfortunes.
    Let us free up our precious time, leave the office, leave the conference room, go to practice, go to the masses, learn from new things, and march towards science and culture! (Attached picture)

　　会议之灾，文牍之祸
　　任中浩
    老问题
    “管理落后于生产”在工业企业里已经叫得很久了。叫尽管叫，但落后的问题始终没有解决，到底是管理就应该落后于生产，根本上就不可能解决呢？还是可能解决而没有找到解决的根本办法呢？我以为不是前者而是后者。
    管理落后于生产是不是机构不健全呢？苏联企业里有的科室我们的工厂都有了，机构不能再多设了。是不是人员不足呢？我们这个工厂现在技术人员和职员的总数占全厂职工总数的17.4％，这个比例数已经很大了。是不是技术人员和职员的质量太低呢？在我们厂里这些人员中党员占50％，而工人党员只占14％。他们的科学文化水平当然要比工人高得多，马克思列宁主义的道理也比工人懂得多，管理业务水平虽不能说高，但是社会主义企业管理的原则、方法、制度基本上都知道，而且有许多人知道得很详细。是不是职责不清呢？现在科室的分工很细，每个科室的名称就代表了它的职责，而且科室职责的条例都有了，大家也学过许多遍了。虽然每个工作人员的工作细则还没有制定出来，但职责基本上是明确的。是不是科室人员不积极、不负责、不努力工作呢？也不是。大部分同志都很积极努力，他们的工作时间都比工人长。这并不是说上述这些已经十全十美了，或多或少都存在着一些问题，但这些都不是管理落后于生产的最根本原因。
    管理是为生产服务的，一切的管理工作都是为了发展生产，所有的管理机构和人员都应该随时发现与解决每时每刻生产中所发生与提出的问题，不解决问题就不能算做管理。要解决问题就要先发现问题。问题在那里呢？生产问题是在生产活动中，而不是在办公室和会议桌上；真实的生产问题是在活生生的生产实践中，而不可能用表格和报告完全反映出来，要发现问题就要深入生产，接触实际。但现在的情况是怎样的呢？我们的领导和科室人员的大部分时间不是更深入生产接触实际，而是消耗在办公室和会议桌上了。滔滔不绝的空议论和连篇累牍的文件表报代替了生动实际的现场观察和具体指导。会议一个接着一个，表报一篇连着一篇，而生产需要解决的问题却是一个等着一个。问题就在这里，根本原因就在这里。会议之灾，文牍之祸——这就是事情的症结所在，这就是管理落后于生产、领导落后于群众、思想落后于实际的根源。
    数不清的会议
    我是一个厂长，我请教过许多苏联顾问、专家：到底怎样才能当好厂长？他们异口同声的回答是“厂长每天一定要下车间去，了解生产情况，检查工作”。
    但我确实太惭愧了，不要说每天，甚至一个礼拜都下不去一次。那末，每天八小时那里去了呢？上边下来、下边上来的文件表报，浏览盖章也得一小时；厂内的各种会议平均至少每天得四小时；找生产长谈一谈生产问题，了解一下生产情况，一小时；剩下的两小时布置工作和处理日常业务往往还不够用。一个星期要听取一次车间科室的运动汇报（一天），写一次运动简报（半天），和苏联专家谈一次工作（半天）。一个月参加市里的会议或报告平均两天，陪同首长或来宾参观工厂每月至少得一天（这成了下车间的机会），一个月要向上级写一次工作报告（一天），每月竞赛评比一次（半天）。每年到北京或省里开会一个半月，脱产学习理论两个半月。以上这些是可以列在预算里的，至于预算外的还很多很多呢！上级机关布置下来的许多工作往往是“厂长负责、亲自动手”“并将执行情况上报”。上级机关派人到厂里来办事，那怕是一个科员，因为是上级机关来的，往往非找厂长谈一谈不行。工人有了问题，科室车间没有很好解决，最后只好找到厂长。每个时期的工作计划与总结要向干部报告一下。一些较重要的大会为了领导重视，要去讲一讲话。还有许多报告和讲课。
    总而言之，数不清的会议、报告，算不清的坐在椅子上的时间。下边的情况是不是会好一些呢？也是大同小异，有些人想起来就开个会，开会简直成了进行工作的主要方法，似乎不开会就不能进行工作，并且把许多沾点边的人都拉到会上来。许多会议既无准备又无中心，开起腔来，东拉西扯，空洞无物，浪费时间。
    真正必要的会议是必须开的。但是检查一下我们的会议，多数是向下灌的多，而真正讨论来自群众中、来自生产中的问题少得很。这种情况越到上层越厉害，灌了一椿又一椿，下边的人只有招架之功，毫无还手之力。只是向下灌，以为灌下去就万事大吉了，不去检查贯彻执行的情况如何，不去了解贯彻执行当中发生的问题，这种做法怎能不发生右倾保守思想呢！右倾保守思想就是看不见新鲜事物。新鲜事物在那里呢？难道不是在不停地发展变化着的生产中而是静静地摆在会议桌上吗！我们天天在会议桌上大喊克服右倾保守思想，但正是这些坐在会议桌上的人们却是实际的右倾保守主义者。尽管我们高谈阔论吧，新鲜事物是不会等我们散会以后才发生、发展的，在沙滩上是永远拾不到鲜鱼的。
    淹没在表报中
    主要领导干部的最大苦恼是会议，那末一般职员最大的苦恼是什么呢？答复是：文牍和不合理的制度、不必要的手续，多得没有人看的表报。
    我们企业的上报表共有六十六种（这已经多次精简了），每年总共上报表七百九十二种次，企业内部用报表四百一十种。据不完全统计，把每年这些报表的用纸展开，面积约为二十万平方米，重量约十吨，纸张、笔、墨、印刷费为四万五千元。这些没有人心疼，也没有人想管。可是，如果工人提出一件合理化建议或生产中需要采取一项措施，或是苏联专家提出一项建议，假定其所需费用在二百元以上，而年度计划又未列入，那么这件事情按照现行制度的规定，其处理程序将是这样：车间审查、工艺科审查、转计划科、转基建科、申请追加基建计划、局批、基建科转计划科、下制造令、承制单位领料、制造、完工销令、领用，共是十二道大手续，几十道小手续；其周期呢？按照惯例，不算制造时间也得两个月，如果当中出点岔子，那就不知道要多久了。
    照规定购置二百元以上的物品就要列为固定资产，在年初编入基本建设计划。企业里二百元以上的东西太多，买一个好一点的千分尺或千分表都超过二百元，至于二百元以上的合理化建议更无法于年初就计划好。大修理费用是按折旧费提取，这笔钱年年用不完，不是用不着，而是不让用，因为大修理有若干条规定，不合乎那一条也不能使用大修理费，尽管这若干条考虑得很周到，但毕竟还不能把一切复杂情况都包罗无遗，而且如果不列入年度计划根本不能开支。因此，钱尽管存在银行里，问题却摆着不能解决。计划一定要有，因为社会主义本来就是计划经济，但计划不能连一点活动的余地都没有。计划是预见，预见就不等于结果，即是最高明的计划师也不可能在年初把全年的事计划得点滴不漏。现在许多事情是上边揽得太多，卡得太死，对下边不放手，不相信，不必要的呈批核准太多。
    谈到计划，也是件苦事情。企业的“生产技术财务计划”一年要编五次，年度计划一次，季度计划四次。编一次年度计划，除了计划科的全体人员外，还要组织其他科室、车间有关人员，总共要一百人左右，编两个月。编一次季度计划差不多也要一个月。每月还要给各车间下达经济指标和核算其完成情况。这样，一年就有半年多是编计划，计划科就成了名副其实的“计划”科了。照理说，计划科应该以小部分时间编计划，大部分时间组织与检查计划的执行，推行厂内经济核算。但现在他们多半的时间是坐办公室编计划，编完一个计划接着一个计划，加上经常上报的各种表报，大部分人几乎是常年的成天在纸上活动，不能深入下去考察实际的经济活动情况，这样的经济计划工作是怎能起到提高经营管理水平的作用呢？我认为把年度计划编好些，季度计划就完全可以不要了，以便把大量的人力从纸上解放出来，到实际的生产经济活动中去从事有意义的工作。
    必须改变作风
    许多事实都说明，机关里的作风是需要改进的。设计表格和发布指示的人往往不知“民间疾苦”，文件上多写一句话或表格上多添一栏，却不知有成千上万的人为它付出多少辛勤劳动！一个报告上去往往几个月批不下来，你这里急如星火，他那里安若泰山。下边向上边要东西，有的给，有的就叫你“想办法，克服困难”；上边向下边要东西，纵使有天大的困难，如不给或给慢了就得受某种批评。报告要的多，有的要得很急，但许多是报上去以后无声无息。
    为了克服这些缺点，我们作了一些努力。过去，我们在贯彻党的依靠工人阶级办好企业的方针中，存在着忽视依靠技术员和职员这一个重要方面的严重缺点。近年来，不适当地强调一长制和不正确地理解一长制，某种程度上一长制变成了手工业作风和家长式领导，削弱了集体智慧和组织作用。今年，我们注意从发动群众依靠群众来加强科室工作，两月以来，行之有效，开展了科室先进工作者运动，组织了科室同业务竞赛和科室之间、个人之间的社会主义竞赛；实行了科室人员的奖励制度；发动科室人员下车间检查工作、解决问题、改进管理业务；建立了必要的领导会议与群众会议制度，按时计划与检查工作。这样，大家的劲头起来了，过去许多需要厂长解决的问题科长解决了，许多不合理的制度和不必要的手续开始由大家动手来改进。现在问题是，领导上的会议还没有减少，文牍还很多，下去深入生产、深入群众的时间还太少，这个问题必须下决心来解决；但这个决心必须大家都下，上上下下一齐动手，消灾灭祸。
    让我们把宝贵的时间腾出来，离开办公室、离开会议室，到实际中去、到群众中去，向新鲜事物学习、向科学文化进军吧！（附图片）
