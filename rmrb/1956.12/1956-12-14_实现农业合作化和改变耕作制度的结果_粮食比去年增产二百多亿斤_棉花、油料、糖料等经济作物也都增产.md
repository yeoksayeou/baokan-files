Xinhua News Agency, 13th - According to estimates from the National Agricultural Conference held on the 11th, this year's national grain crops, as well as economic crops such as cotton, oil crops, and sugar crops, have all increased in production compared to 1955. Among them, the output of rice, wheat, potatoes, miscellaneous grains, flue-cured tobacco, and tea have all exceeded the production targets for 1957, the final year of the First Five-Year Plan.

The conference statistics also specifically indicate that among the more than 20 billion jin of grain increased nationally compared to last year, the output of rice and wheat accounted for more than 16 billion jin, while the output of potatoes and miscellaneous grains only accounted for about 30% of the increased grain production. (Note: Last year's total grain output was 368 billion jin).

The achievement of national agricultural cooperativization and the large-scale changes in farming systems, as well as the promotion of various advanced production experiences and measures, are important reasons for overcoming this year's severe drought and flood disasters and achieving an increase in production compared to last year. According to statistics, this year the national multiple cropping index for various crops reached 140%, with a multiple cropping area of more than 600 million mu. The national area of double-cropping rice and dryland converted to paddy fields also reached 50 million mu, and the planting area of high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes also increased compared to last year. In addition, the number of farmland water conservancy projects built across the country this year and the area for promotion of improved varieties of grain, cotton, and other crops were also greater than in any previous year. These efforts have played a significant role in ensuring this year's agricultural increase.

However, this year, some areas have had problems with being overly hasty in changing farming systems and promoting various improved varieties of crops, and the plans for promoting new-style agricultural tools have also been unrealistic. These issues will be summarized and studied in detail at this conference.

    实现农业合作化和改变耕作制度的结果
    粮食比去年增产二百多亿斤
    棉花、油料、糖料等经济作物也都增产
    新华社13日讯　据11日举行的全国农业会议预计，今年全国粮食作物和棉花、油料、糖料等经济作物都比1955年增产。其中稻谷、小麦、薯类、杂粮和烤烟、茶叶的产量，都超过第一个五年计划最后一年1957年的生产指标。
    会议的统计还具体表明，全国比去年增产的二百多亿斤粮食中，稻谷和小麦的产量占到一百六十多亿斤，薯类和杂粮的产量只占粮食增产部分的30％左右。（按：去年的粮食总产量是三千六百八十亿斤）
    全国农业合作化的实现和大规模的改变耕作制度以及各项先进生产经验和生产措施的推广，是战胜今年严重水旱灾害从而获得比去年增产的重要原因。据统计，今年全国各种农作物复种指数达到了140％，复种面积达到六亿多亩，全国双季稻和旱地改水田的面积也达到五千万亩，玉米和薯类高产作物的种植面积也比去年有增加；此外，今年全国各地兴建的农田水利工程和粮、棉等作物的良种推广面积也都比以往任何一年多。这些工作对保证今年农业增产都起了很大作用。
    但是今年有部分地区由于在改变耕作制度、推广各种农作物良种等工作中存在过急求快的毛病，推广新式农具的计划也定得脱离实际。这些问题都将在这次会议上进行详细的总结和研究。
