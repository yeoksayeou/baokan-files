　　“Multi-Headed” Sorghum
　　By Our Correspondent Miao Feng
    At the entrance of the agricultural product exhibition room of Baoshan Agricultural Cooperative in Suihua County, Heilongjiang, many male and female members were discussing: "One sorghum plant has eight heads, and some even have twelve! Only planted on 0.12 mu of land, and it yielded 330 jin. Then how about 1.2 mu? 3300 jin! How about one qing? How about ten qing? How about one hundred qing?..." From the crowd, there were constant sounds of "tsk, tsk." Someone squeezed to the front, picked up a grain, wanting to put it in their mouth, perhaps to test its authenticity, perhaps to chew on its taste, but it was snatched away by a big old man: "Don't waste a single grain! Do you know how hard it was to get this sorghum!" How did this sorghum come to be? The big old man—member Hu Wenran—knew it best.
    Last winter, Hu Wenran went to his hometown (Jiangjia Village, Heishan County, Liaoning Province) to visit relatives. He saw several sorghum ears hanging from the beams of Zheng Laosan's house, with a newspaper hanging below them. Upon inquiring, he learned that it was a rare type of sorghum—"multi-headed" sorghum. Hu Wenran wanted a few ears, but as soon as he opened his mouth, Zheng Laosan said, "I'm keeping these to hand over to the cooperative for trial planting."
    Hu Wenran said, "I'm not taking them back to do business!" After much persuasion, Zheng Laosan relented and finally gave him four ears. After getting this "treasure," he couldn't stay in his hometown any longer, no matter who tried to keep him.
    On the train, look at how he carried the newspaper package, dodging and hiding. It was truly: he was afraid of crushing it if he put it on the luggage rack, and afraid of bumping it if he held it in his hand, so he simply took off his jacket to wrap it and held it in his arms.
    His wife and children, seeing how happy he was, asked him what good thing had happened. He always said, "Nothing." Actually, he was afraid the children would rummage and damage the sorghum. That night, he finally said to his wife, "I brought a treasure back to our cooperative!..." His wife wouldn't believe it. Early the next morning, Hu Wenran went from house to house, asking people to answer one question: How many ears can one sorghum plant actually grow? Can one qing of sorghum yield 20,000 jin? The answers made him hesitate. He thought: If I rashly gave it to the cooperative, and the "land spirit" wasn't right, and it wasn't the same, what would I do?
    By the time all the cooperative's sorghum was sown and the first hoeing had begun, Hu Wenran finally told cooperative director Sun Shoucheng. Sun Shoucheng said, "Why didn't you say so earlier? Hurry up and plant it, and even if it's not the same, we won't lose money. If it is, we'll have struck gold."
    The multi-stemmed, multi-eared sorghum on which the members of Baoshan Cooperative had spent so much effort was finally harvested. On the day of the harvest, the members were at the entrance of the agricultural product exhibition room, discussing this rare crop.
    They plan to plant more next year to try it out.

　　“多头”的高粱
　　本报记者　苗风
    黑龙江绥化县宝山农业社农产品展览室门口，许多男女社员在议论着：“一株高粱八个穗，还有十二个穗的！只种了一分二厘地，就打了三百三十斤，那么一亩二呢？三千三，一垧呢？十垧呢？一百垧呢？……”人群里不时发出“啧啧”的声音。是谁挤到前面，拿起一粒，想放到嘴里，也许是想试试真假，也许是想嚼一嚼什么味道，却被一个大个子老头抢去了：“一颗也不许糟蹋！你知道这高粱来的多不容易啊！”这高粱是怎么来的呢？那大个子老头——社员胡文然，他知道的最清楚。
    去年冬天，胡文然去老家（辽宁省黑山县姜家村）探亲，他看到郑老三家房梁上吊着几穗高粱，下面还吊着一张报纸。一打问，才知道是一种稀有的高粱——“多头”高粱。胡文然想要几穗，可是刚一开口，郑老三就说：“我留这想交给社里试种。”
    胡文然说：“我拿回去也不是做买卖呀！”三说两说，把郑老三给说住了，终于给了他四穗。他得了这“宝贝”以后，在老家再住不下去了，谁留也留不住。
    上了火车，你看他手提报纸包，躲躲闪闪的样儿，那真是：放在行李架上怕压了，提在手里怕碰了，索性脱下夹衣包起来，抱在怀里。
    老婆和孩子们看到他的高兴劲儿，都问他有什么喜欢事，他总说
  “没啥”。原来他怕孩子们把这高粱翻腾坏。晚上，他才对老婆说：“我给咱社带回宝贝来啦！……”老婆那里肯信。第二天一早，胡文然出东家进西家，他只要人们回答一个问题：究竟一株高粱能长几个穗？一垧高粱能不能打两万斤？人们的回答，使他犹豫起来了。他想：如果冒然给了社里，因为“地气”不对，要不是那么回事，可怎么办？
    到了春天，全社的高粱都播种完了，又开始锄头遍，胡文然才告诉社主任孙守成。孙守成说：“你怎么不早说，赶快种上再讲，就不是那么回事，也不会赔本，要是了，咱就抓住了。”
    宝山社的社员们花费了多少心血的多茎穗高粱终于收获了。就在收获的那天，社员们才在农产品展览室门口，议论着这稀罕的庄稼。
    他们打算明年种更多一些试一试。
