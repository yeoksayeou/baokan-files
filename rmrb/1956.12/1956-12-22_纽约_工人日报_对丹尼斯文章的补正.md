Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The New York "Daily Worker" made a correction on November 30th to the article "'Daily Worker' and Hungary" by American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis published in the "Daily Worker" on November 29th. The full text of the correction is as follows: We regret to inform you that due to a printing error, three paragraphs were omitted from Dennis's article "'Daily Worker' and Hungary" on November 29th.
(The article "'Daily Worker' and Hungary" was published on page 6 of this newspaper on December 18th. The following three paragraphs should be inserted after the eighth line of the fourth column.)

    These situations may seem absurd and ridiculous, not right. I certainly believe they are. However, strange things have continued to happen in the pages of the
  "Daily Worker," where letters advocating "the right to overthrow socialism" have been published without being refuted by the editors. However, even stranger things are possible if one does not frequently remember, no matter what else may have changed, that American monopoly capital remains the number one enemy of the American working class and people, and the number one enemy of world peace and democratic progress.

    If some editors of the "Daily Worker" had ever "remembered" this basic fact, they might not have been so slow to condemn Lodge's provocative demand that the United Nations condemn the actions that the Soviet Union was forced to take in Hungary; they also would not have equated the Soviet Union's intervention on November 4th with the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt based on conjecture.

    When American big business is still the main enemy of peace, national liberation, democracy, and progress everywhere, how can the "Daily Worker's" international news editor cheer for the "democratic progress" of Bonn Germany, Japan, and Finland? While his typewriter was erasing the danger of a fascist coup in Hungary, wasn't it also erasing the danger of military revanchists and neo-fascist movements in the part of Germany ruled by Adenauer?

### 纽约“工人日报”  对丹尼斯文章的补正

    纽约“工人日报”
    对丹尼斯文章的补正
    新华社讯　11月30日的纽约“工人日报”就美国共产党总书记丹尼斯在11月29日“工人日报”上发表的文章“‘工人日报’和匈牙利”作了一次补正，补正的全文如下：我们很抱歉地通知，由于印刷厂的疏忽，11月29日丹尼斯的“‘工人日报’和匈牙利”的一篇文章中漏排了三段。
  （“‘工人日报’和匈牙利”一文刊登在12月18日本报第六版，下面三段应补在第四栏第八行以后。）
    这些情况可能看来像是荒谬可笑的，不对头的。我肯定相信它们是这样的。但是，怪事却一直在
  “工人日报”的版面上发生，在这里，一些鼓吹“推翻社会主义的权利”的信未经编辑们批驳而刊登出来了。但是，要是不经常记住，不管别的什么事情可能已经改变了，美国垄断资本仍然是美国工人阶级和人民的头号敌人，是世界和平和民主进步的头号敌人，要是不经常记住这一点，更怪的事情也是可能发生的。
    要是“工人日报”的一些编辑曾经“记住”这个基本事实，他们原可能不会那么迟迟不斥责洛奇提出的要联合国谴责苏联在匈牙利不得不采取的行动的这一挑衅要求；他们也原不会根据推断而把苏联在11月4日的出兵同英法以对埃及的侵略相提并论。
    当美国大企业还是各地的和平、民族解放、民主和进步的主要敌人的时候，“工人日报”的国际新闻编辑怎么能够对波恩德国、日本和芬兰的“民主进步”喝采呢？他的打字机在勾消在匈牙利发生法西斯政变的危险的同时，难道不是也勾消了在阿登纳统治的那一部分德国的军事复仇主义者和新法西斯运动的危险吗？
