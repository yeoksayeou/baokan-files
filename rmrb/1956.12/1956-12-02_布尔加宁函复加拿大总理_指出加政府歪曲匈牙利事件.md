Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 30th: TASS reports that Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bulganin, wrote to Canadian Prime Minister St. Laurent on November 24th, replying to St. Laurent's letter of November 13th concerning the Hungarian incident.

In his letter, St. Laurent attempted to place the responsibility for the situation in Hungary on the Soviet Union and to portray the counter-revolutionary conspiracy as a struggle for democracy. In his reply, Bulganin told the Prime Minister that the content of his letter, as well as his recent statements on the Hungarian situation and the remarks by Canadian officials on the matter, indicated that the Canadian government had clearly received one-sided, biased, and inaccurate information regarding the Hungarian events and the Soviet Union's position on them. The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, in its statement, had already made it clear that reactionary forces within Hungary, with the active support of certain external groups, were attempting to overthrow the people's democratic system in the country and establish a Horthy-fascist regime. Patriotic forces in Hungary rose up to defend the people's democratic system and requested assistance from Soviet troops stationed in Hungary under the Warsaw Treaty.

Bulganin said that the Soviet government's position on the issue of Soviet-Hungarian relations was stated in detail in the "Declaration on the Foundations for the Development and Further Strengthening of Friendship and Cooperation between the Soviet Union and Other Socialist Countries," published on October 31, 1956.

Referring to St. Laurent's question regarding the Soviet government's assistance to international organizations in obtaining opportunities to help the Hungarian people with food and medicine, Bulganin said, "This issue falls entirely within the purview of the Hungarian government. As far as we know, the government of the Hungarian People's Republic has definitively resolved this issue, and the Hungarian government has officially notified the Secretary-General of the United Nations about this matter."

　  布尔加宁函复加拿大总理
　　指出加政府歪曲匈牙利事件
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11月30日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁11月24日写信给加拿大总理圣劳伦，答复圣劳伦11月13日就匈牙利事件给布尔加宁的一封信。
    圣劳伦在他的信中企图把在匈牙利形成的局面的责任推在苏联身上，并且企图把反革命阴谋活动说成是争取民主的斗争。布尔加宁在复信中对这位总理说，您的信的内容以及您不久以前就匈牙利局势发表的声明和加拿大官方人士对这个问题的言论，说明了加拿大政府在匈牙利事件和苏联对这一事件所采取的立场方面显然得到了片面的、别有用心的、不客观的消息。匈牙利工农革命政府在它的声明中已经说明，匈牙利内部的反动势力在外部某些集团的积极支持下，企图推翻国内的人民民主制度和建立霍尔蒂—法西斯主义政权。匈牙利国内的爱国力量起来保卫人民民主制度，要求根据华沙条约驻在匈牙利的苏联军队给予帮助。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府在苏联同匈牙利的相互关系问题上所采取的立场已经十分详尽地写在1956年10月31日公布的“关于发展和进一步加强苏联同其他社会主义国家的友谊和合作的基础的宣言”里。
    在谈到圣劳伦提出的关于苏联政府协助国际组织去获得用粮食和医药品帮助匈牙利人民的机会这一问题的时候，布尔加宁说：“这个问题完全属于匈牙利政府的权限以内。据我们所知，匈牙利人民共和国政府肯定地解决了这个问题，关于这件事，匈牙利政府已经正式通知了联合国秘书长”。
