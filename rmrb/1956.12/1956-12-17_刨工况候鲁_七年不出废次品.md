Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, December 16th: Kuang Houru, a planer operator in the metalworking workshop of the local state-owned Jiangxi Machinery Factory, has processed more than 10,000 products since 1950 without producing any rejects, defective products, or items requiring rework.

The main reason Kuang Houru can strictly guarantee product quality is his consistently serious and meticulous approach to production operations. Whenever he is assigned a product to process, he carefully examines the drawings, firmly memorizing the specifications and precision requirements of each part to be processed. He not only strictly adheres to the drawings but also pays special attention to preventing rejects caused by drawing errors. He also pays close attention to inspecting semi-finished products, making thorough preparations before starting the machine. To ensure that product quality is not affected, he pays particular attention to the maintenance of machine tools, and there have been no machine equipment accidents in recent years.

Kuang Houru not only guarantees good product quality but also strives to increase output. Initially, when processing the "inner stop" of the ten-horsepower gas-powered water pump body, he used a single-blade planing operation, which allowed him to plane only two or three units a day. After careful and continuous research and deliberation, he later switched to double-blade planing, enabling him to plane at least twelve units a day, increasing output by more than four times. As a result, he consistently overfulfills his production targets.

    刨工况候鲁
    七年不出废次品
    据新华社南昌16日电　地方国营江西机械厂金工车间刨工况候鲁，自1950年到现在，七年内加工了一万多件产品，没有出过废品、次品和退修品。
    况候鲁所以能严格保证产品质量，主要是他在生产操作上一贯认真仔细。凡是交给他加工的产品，一定仔细地看清图纸，把各部分加工的规格精度都牢牢地记住。他不仅严格照着图纸做，而且还特别注意防止因为图纸错误造成废品。他还十分注意检查半成品，作好准备，然后开车。为了使产品质量不受影响，他对机床的保养特别重视，几年来没有出过一次机床设备事故。
    况候鲁不但保证产品质量好，而且努力提高产量。他最初加工十匹马力煤气抽水机机体“内当”，原来是采取单刀刨削作业，一天只能刨两、三台。经过他细心不断地钻研、琢磨，后来改为双刀刨削以后，每天最低能刨十二台，提高产量四倍多。因此，他还经常超额完成生产任务。
