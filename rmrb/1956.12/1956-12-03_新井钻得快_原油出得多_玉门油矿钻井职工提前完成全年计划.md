　　New Wells Drilled Quickly, More Crude Oil Produced
　　Yumen Oilfield Drilling Workers Complete Annual Plan Ahead of Schedule

    Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, December 2nd: The Yumen Oilfield Drilling Company completed its drilling footage plan for this year ahead of schedule by one month as of November 30th. The total footage increased by more than double compared to the same period last year, equivalent to more than eight times the total drilling footage of the Yumen Oilfield from 1939 to the early liberation year of 1949 (ten years).

    Since the beginning of this year, the technical level of drilling workers has greatly improved. Instances of drilling one hundred or two hundred meters per day have become common. The 3206 Drilling Team has twice created new national records for daily petroleum drilling footage this year, with the highest reaching 601.5 meters. Several other drilling teams have also created records of drilling one thousand meters per month. The 3203 Drilling Team also created the highest record in China's petroleum drilling for average drilling rig monthly speed of 1153.64 meters. In the past, it was considered remarkable for Chinese petroleum drilling workers to drill deep exploration wells of more than 2,000 meters. This year, the drilling company's workers drilled two deep exploration wells in the Jiuquan Basin that were both over 3,000 meters, with the deepest reaching 6.4 li. This year, the drilling workers also initially learned the technology of using turbine drills for drilling, and used this drilling tool to drill two directional oil wells, one double-barrel directional oil well, and some straight wells. Due to the timely drilling and commissioning of a large number of new oil wells, the crude oil production of Laojunmiao and Shiyougou has greatly increased. The crude oil produced by the Shiyougou oilfield from January to October alone was more than one and a half times the total output of last year.

　　新井钻得快　原油出得多
　  玉门油矿钻井职工提前完成全年计划
    据新华社玉门2日电　玉门油矿钻井公司到11月30日为止提前一个月超额完成了今年的钻井进尺计划。进尺总数和去年同期相比增加了一倍多，等于玉门油矿从1939年到刚解放的1949年这十年间钻井进尺总和的八倍多。
    今年以来，钻井职工们的技术水平大大提高了。日进百公尺、二百公尺的事例已经成为通常现象。三二零六钻井队今年就曾经连续两次创造了全国石油钻井日进尺的新纪录，最高的一次达到六百零一点五公尺。还有好几个钻井队创造了月进一千公尺的纪录。三二零三钻井队还创造了我国石油钻井平均钻机月速度一千一百五十三点六四公尺的最高纪录。从前，我国石油钻井工人能钻两千公尺以上的深探井曾被认为是了不起的事，今年钻井公司的工人在酒泉盆地钻成的两口深探井都在三千公尺以上，其中最深的一口达六点四华里。钻井工人今年还初步学会了使用涡轮钻具钻井的技术，并且运用这种钻具钻成了两口石油斜向井、一口双筒石油斜向井和一些直井。由于大批新油井的及时钻成并且投入生产，老君庙和石油沟的原油产量大大增加。只是石油沟油田一至十月份生产的原油，比去年全年的产量还多一倍半以上。
