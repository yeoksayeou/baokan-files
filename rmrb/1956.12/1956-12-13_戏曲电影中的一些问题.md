Some Problems in Opera Films
Tang Shi

In recent years, we have filmed some opera movies. These films have been well received in both urban and rural areas. Among them, the Yue opera "The Butterfly Lovers" and the Huangmei opera "The Heavenly Match" have also been welcomed by foreign audiences. This is partly because we have a profound tradition of opera art, and excellent opera actors have high artistic talents that can attract people; on the other hand, it is also because the general audience rarely has the opportunity to see the performances of famous opera actors, and can only see them through movies.

Opera films not only meet the requirements of the general audience, but more importantly, the films can record the performances of famous performing artists and pass them on to future generations.

Therefore, we must attach importance to the filming of opera films.

However, I feel that there are some problems in this work at present.

I would like to talk about these problems through examples of some opera films.

The first problem is that some films damage the integrity of the performance.

Mr. Gai Jiaotian is a famous "Living Wu Song," and he is also good at playing villainous characters like Shi Wengong, and he plays them with flesh and blood, never simplifying them. He advocates "martial arts with literary singing" and pays the most attention to creating vivid characters. However, in the movie "Gai Jiaotian's Stage Art," there are only technical performances such as walking the stage and single-knife techniques, which are like a "grand performance," but do not show the image of Wu Song, Shi Wengong, or Chen Xiang that he created to the audience. Of course, Mr. Gai Jiaotian also has many creations in martial arts, which greatly enrich the performance of martial arts dramas and are very valuable. But what should be even more valuable is how he uses these martial arts to create a living Wu Song or a living Chen Xiang. "Mei Lanfang's Stage Art" also has a similar situation, with only some fragmented singing and dancing performances, and very few complete performances of the whole play, which is almost fragmented and greatly damages Mr. Mei's complete artistic creation.

The recently started Peking Opera "The Gathering of Heroes" is said to have the same "truncated" situation in the shooting plan.

"The Gathering of Heroes" is the "unique skill" of the Sanqing Anhui Opera Troupe led by Cheng Changgeng, the founder of Peking Opera in the Qing Dynasty – the most important section of the forty volumes of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and can also be called "The Battle of Red Cliffs." The forty volumes of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" are a great epic. At that time, it was only performed once a year at the end of the year, for more than half a month. It was the Sanqing Troupe's grand gift to the audience, bringing together the best Peking Opera performing masters of the time, such as Cheng Changgeng as the living Lu Su, Xu Xiaoxiang as the living Zhou Yu, Huang Runfu as the living Cao Cao, Qian Baofeng as the living Zhang Fei, Lu Shengkui and Liu Gansi as the living Kongming, and Yang Yuelou and Tan Xinpei, etc., performing together in a group play where actors from all walks of life cooperated splendidly. Unfortunately, there were no movies at that time to record their wonderful performances. Later, because the old actors often picked the lead, the plays of the painted faces and martial arts students were often reduced a lot, and Cao Cao, Huang Gai, Zhao Yun, etc. had almost no plays to perform. The recently started "The Gathering of Heroes" has also invited famous actors such as Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Ye Shengian, Qiu Shengrong, Sun Yukun, and the 79-year-old Mr. Xiao Changhua to participate in the performance. If this play can be performed completely from Jiang Gan crossing the river to Huarong Road, it can truly be called an epic of heroes depicting the most important war in the Three Kingdoms era – the Battle of Red Cliffs. However, it is said that the current shooting plan does not include important links such as reciting poetry with a spear across the saddle, burning warships, and Huarong Road, making heroes such as Cao Cao and Huang Gai have no place to use their talents. If the play of Cao Cao, this magnanimous and ambitious villain, is weakened, can this film still be called "The Gathering of Heroes"? Without burning warships, what purpose do the previous battles of wits serve? Therefore, I think this film should be filmed as a complete stage documentary, and should not be excessively deleted, so as not to damage the integrity of the play's performance.

The second problem is that the film damages the style of the performance.

"Hua Mulan" and "The Heavenly Match" are the most typical examples.

In the scene of Hua Mulan in the machine room, not only does the freehand weaving dance movement conflict with the real weaving machine, but also the real house conflicts with the dancing steps, the simple room conflicts with the beautiful dance posture, and the dim house color conflicts with the bright costumes of the actors. When setting off, Hua Mulan takes her horse under a large tree, which is not only a contradiction between the real wilderness scenery and the "standing still" horse-riding without a horse, making people feel funny, but also Hua Mulan's dance posture and exaggerated expression are incompatible with the vast real background. The most ridiculous thing is the battle scene, which is neither the dancing battle method common in Peking Opera and Henan Opera, nor the real charge melee battle method, but a "neither fish nor fowl." In opera, a stagehand holding a military flag represents a team of people and horses. When the stagehands on both sides hand over the military flags, it means that two teams of people and horses are fighting. Now in the movie, due to the real scenery, the military flags cannot intersect. What should the stagehands holding the flags on both sides do? They have no choice but to shake the flags desperately, which is exactly the same as the old saying "waving flags and shouting."

The movie "The Heavenly Match" is fascinating and beautiful. But this movie is very different from the original stage performance. The lovely style and local flavor of Huangmei Opera can be said to be very little retained. I have seen the original old version and the performance in the East China Opera Festival, as well as the movie and the recent stage performance that basically follows the movie. I feel that many of Yan Fengying's excellent performances have been greatly weakened in the movie and the recent performance. Therefore, the moving power of this play has also been greatly weakened. The main problem is that the adapter of the movie performance version and the movie director pay too much attention to the story directly serving the theme and the tragic or serious drama style, so the plot and characters are simplified, and many plots and performances that can just express the character's personality and the style of folk opera are deleted, just like a camellia tree, the flowers and leaves are cut off, leaving only the trunk and some branches. For example, in the silk weaving scene, the old version uses a clown to play the eldest sister, guiding the sisters to weave silk together, singing the Five Watches Tune. When the first watch sings of mosquitoes, she weaves mosquitoes on the silk, and when the second watch sings of frogs, she weaves frogs on the silk. The humor of the lyrics and performance is very fascinating. The East China Opera Festival retained this section of lyrics and humorous performance, only changing the clown to a handsome actor, which I think is a very good change. However, the movie and this performance changed her to a Qingyi, and the lyrics were also changed to a serious "Weaving Silk Song," which greatly reduced the color, and there was no folk flavor or local opera style at all. Due to the influence of the director's acting methods for spoken drama, Yan Fengying's excellent opera performance has also become ordinary. From the time she came out to visit the Magpie Bridge, she frowned and was very nervous, while in the East China Opera Festival, I remember that she performed quite lively and freely, and was very able to convey the mood of a naive and lively fairy in the sky.

There are also many problems in the music and stage art of this play in the movie and the current performance. For example, percussion music has almost been cancelled. We are not against adding some lyrical orchestral accompaniment, but percussion music occupies an important position in traditional art. The reduction of percussion music means the cancellation of certain stage steps and dance postures and the drama of the performance, which is also inseparable from the "realistic" scenery. For example, in the two most important scenes of "Meeting on the Road" and "Farewell in the Huaiyin," the movie has a real road, so the stage steps and the falling dance posture at the time of parting are cancelled; in the current performance, there is a road scenery, but the actors are still circling on the stage and do not walk the two big roads up and down. In any case, there is a contradiction between the freehand dance and the real scenery. Such scenery can only destroy the unity of the style of folk art.

From these examples, the root cause of the two problems is only one, that is, not enough respect for the tradition of folk art and for national art.

I think this question is worth thinking about for comrades engaged in filming opera movies. Of course, the comrades who make opera films may also have some difficulties, but in any case, the current practice of buying the casket and returning the pearl and cutting the feet to fit the shoes is inappropriate and worth everyone's good consideration.

As an audience, I put forward these personal views in the hope that everyone will pay attention to this issue.

    戏曲电影中的一些问题
    唐湜
    最近几年来，我们拍摄了一些戏曲电影。这些电影不论在都市、农村都受到了欢迎，其中越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”和黄梅戏“天仙配”还受到了国外观众的欢迎。这一方面是由于我们有深厚的戏曲艺术传统，优秀的戏曲演员又有很高的艺术才能，能吸引人；另一方面也由于广大观众平常很少有机会看到著名戏曲演员的表演，只有通过电影才能看到的缘故。
    戏曲电影不仅满足了广大观众的要求，更有意义的，是电影可以把著名表演艺术家的表演记录下来留传后世。
    因此，我们必须重视戏曲电影的拍摄工作。
    但我觉得目前这一方面的工作中存在着一些问题。
    我想通过一些戏曲电影的例子来谈谈这些问题。
    第一个问题是有些影片损害了演出的完整性。
    盖叫天老先生是有名的“活武松”，他也擅长演史文恭这一类反派人物，而且演得有血有肉，绝不简单化。他主张“武戏文唱”，最注意创造活生生的人物。但电影“盖叫天的舞台艺术”中，只有走边、单刀一类技术表演，活像一出“大卖艺”，却没有把他创造的活生生的武松、史文恭或者沉香的形象在观众面前展现出来。当然，盖叫天先生在武技上也有许多创造，大大丰富了武戏的表演，非常可贵。但更可贵的应该是：他如何运用这些武技来塑造活武松或活沉香。“梅兰芳的舞台艺术”也有类似的情形，其中只有一些片断的歌舞表演，而很少完整的整出戏的演出，近于支离破碎，大大损害了梅先生的完整的艺术创作。
    最近开拍的京剧“群英会”，在拍摄计划中据说也有这种“截头去尾”的情况。
    “群英会”是清代京剧的奠基人程长庚领导的三庆徽班的“绝活”——四十本“三国志”的最主要的一大段，也可以称作“赤壁鏖兵”。四十本“三国志”是一部伟大的史诗，当时每年只在年终演出一次，连演半个多月，是三庆班对观众的隆重献礼，集中了当时最好的京剧表演大师，如活鲁肃程长庚、活周瑜徐小香、活曹操黄润甫、活张飞钱宝峰、活孔明卢胜奎与刘赶三以及杨月楼、谭鑫培等合力演出，是个各行演员合作得花团锦簇的群戏。可惜当时还没有电影，不能把他们精彩万分的表演记录下来。后来因为老生常挑班，花脸、武生的戏往往被削减很多，曹操、黄盖、赵云等简直几乎无戏可做了。最近开拍的“群英会”也约了马连良、谭富英、叶盛兰、裘盛戎、孙毓堃等名演员以及七十九岁的肖长华老先生参加演出。如果能把这个戏由蒋干过江起，到华容道为止完完整整地演出来，也真可以称得起是表现了三国时代的一次最重要的战争——赤壁之战的英雄史诗。可是听说现在的拍摄计划中竟没有横槊赋诗、火烧战船、华容道这些重要的环节，使曹操、黄盖等英雄竟无用武之地。如果削弱了曹操这位气魄磅礴的奸雄的戏，这个片子还能称得起是“群英会”吗？没有火烧战船，前面的那些斗智又是为什么目的服务的呢？因此我觉得这个片子应该作为完完整整的舞台记录片来拍摄，而不要过多地加以删节，以免损害了这个戏演出的完整性。
    第二个问题是影片损害了演出的风格。
    “花木兰”和“天仙配”是最典型的例子。
    花木兰在机房中的一场戏，不仅写意的织布舞蹈动作和真实的织布机有矛盾，就是真实的房屋和舞蹈性的台步、简陋的房间和优美的舞蹈身段、暗淡的房屋色调和演员的鲜艳服装也有矛盾。在出发时，花木兰在一株大树下大趟其马，不仅真实的荒野景色和“原地踏步走”的没有马的趟马有矛盾，使人看了有滑稽之感，就是花木兰的舞蹈身段和夸张表情，也和广阔的真实背景不调和。最滑稽的还是作战场面，既不是京剧和豫剧中常见的舞蹈性的战法，又不是真实的冲锋肉搏战法，竟是一种“四不像”。戏曲中一个龙套拿一面军旗是代表一队人马，双方龙套拿军旗一交就表示两队人马交战。现在在影片中，由于真实布景，军旗不能相交，双方执旗的龙套怎么办好呢？就只好拚命摇着旗，正合了“摇旗呐喊”这句老话。
    影片“天仙配”是迷人的，很美。但这个影片和原来的舞台演出距离很大。黄梅戏的那种可爱的风格和乡土气息可以说保留得很少。我看过原来的老本和华东戏曲会演中的演出，也看过电影和最近基本上按照电影演出本来演的舞台演出。我觉得严凤英同志的许多优美的表演在电影与最近的演出中被大大地削弱了，因此，这个戏的动人力量也大大地被削弱了。主要的问题在于电影演出本改编者和电影导演太注意故事的直接服务于主题和悲剧或正剧的格调，因而把情节和人物都简单化了，把许多恰好很能表现人物性格和民间戏曲风格的情节与表演都删去了，正如一株山茶树，花与叶都被剪掉了，只剩下了树干与一些枝桠。例如织绢一场，老本用彩旦扮演大姐，引导姐妹们一起织绢，唱着五更调，一更蚊子叫就把蚊子织在绢上，二更蛤蟆叫就把蛤蟆织在绢上。唱词与表演的诙谐很能引人入胜，华东会演时保留了这一段唱词和诙谐的表演，只把彩旦改为俊扮，我觉得改得很好。但电影和这次演出把她改为青衣，唱词也改为正正经经的“织绢歌”，这就大为减色，民间的风味和地方戏的风格就一点也没有了。由于导演的话剧的表演手法的影响，严凤英同志的优美的戏曲表演也就归于平淡。从一出来游鹊桥起，她就皱着眉头非常紧张，而在华东会演时，我记得她是表演得颇为活泼自如的，很能传达出一个天真活泼的天上仙女的心情。
    这个戏的电影和现在的演出在音乐上与舞台美术上也存在着较多问题。例如打击乐几乎被取消了。我们不反对加上一些抒情的管弦乐伴奏，但打击乐在传统艺术中是占着重要地位的，打击乐的减少就意味着某些台步和舞蹈身段的取消和表演的话剧化，而这也和“现实”的布景分不开。例如在“路遇”和“槐荫别”两场最重要的戏中，在电影中是真实的路，因而就取消了台步与分别时的跌扑舞蹈身段；在现在的演出中，有路的布景，但演员仍在台上兜圈子不走那上下两条大路。不管怎样，写意的舞蹈与真实的布景是有矛盾的，这样的布景只能破坏民间艺术的风格的统一。
    从这些例子看来，两个问题的根源只有一个，那就是对民间艺术传统、对民族艺术的尊重不够。
    我觉得这个问题是值得从事拍摄戏曲电影工作的同志思考一下的。当然，拍戏曲电影的同志可能也有一些苦衷，但无论如何，目前这种买椟还珠和削足适履的作法是不妥当的，是值得大家很好地考虑的。
    作为一个观众，我提出这一些个人的看法，希望大家来注意这个问题。
