    Oppose Creating Artificial Tension
    Recently, the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's Transmission and Transformation Project urgently needed a level. They heard that the Shenyang Tool and Instrument Store had this kind of level, so they quickly sent someone to buy it. However, the other party demanded that they allocate a large amount of steel and wood to them, otherwise they would not sell it. In fact, this level was an imported product and did not require the Shenyang Tool and Instrument Store to supply raw materials at all.
    Not long ago, this engineering bureau also heard that the Shenyang Transportation Equipment Store had received several new sedans. When they sent someone to buy them, the other party also demanded that they allocate some steel bars to them, otherwise they would not sell them. When asked what they needed the steel bars for, they said: "We are building staff dormitories and are short of steel bars."
    The method of inter-unit mutual exchange of materials, using surplus materials to exchange for materials urgently needed for production, is originally a good way to tap potential. However, if materials that are not urgently needed are also used to "make waves" and emphasize the need to exchange goods, taking advantage of others' difficulties to profit, what benefit does it bring to the country besides increasing the artificial tension in material supply?

    反对制造人为紧张
    电力工业部送变电第三工程局最近工程上急需要一种水平仪。他们听说沈阳工具仪器商店有这种水平仪，就赶快派人买。但是，对方提出必须调给他们大量的钢材和木材，否则就不卖给。其实这种水平仪是进口货，根本用不着沈阳工具仪器商店供给原料。
    不久以前，这个工程局又听说沈阳交通器材商店新到几部轿车，派人去买时，对方也提出必须调给他们若干钢筋，否则也不卖给。问他们要钢筋干什么用，他们说：“我们修建职工宿舍正缺钢筋。”
    把自己多余的材料拿出来换进生产上迫切需要的材料，这种各单位之间互通有无，以货易货的办法，本来是目前挖掘潜力的一种好办法。但是，如果并不急需要的材料，也“兴风作浪”地强调必须以货易货，趁人之危捞一把，那除了加重材料供应的人为紧张以外，对国家有什么好处呢？
