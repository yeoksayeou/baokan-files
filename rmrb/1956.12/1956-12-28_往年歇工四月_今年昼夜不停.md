　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 24th - In past years, the freezing period was usually the time when all brick factories in Henan Province closed down, but this year they have broken with this practice. Since the beginning of winter, the workers in the brick factories under the Henan Provincial Department of Industry have been working day and night to produce bricks for next year's basic construction.
　　Most of the brick factory work is done in the open air. After freezing, the work of making and drying blanks encountered serious obstacles, and work had to be stopped for about four months every year. In order to support basic construction, this year, the local state-owned brick factories in Henan Province prepared more than 70 million brick blanks during the warm season for winter production, enough for each factory to use until after the thaw next spring. Each factory also converted ordinary drying tile houses into fire-heated drying equipment, so that tile blank production can continue as usual in the severe winter season.

    往年歇工四月  今年昼夜不停
    新华社郑州24日电　历年冰冻期间，照例是河南省所有砖瓦厂关门歇业的日子，但是今年这里打破了惯例。入冬以来，河南省工业厅所属各个砖瓦厂的工人们都一直昼夜不停地为明年的基本建设生产砖瓦。
    砖瓦厂的作业大部分是在露天进行的。冰冻以后，制坯、晾坯工作遇到严重障碍，历年都要为此停工四个月左右。为了支援基本建设，今年河南省地方国营砖瓦厂在温暖季节里，就为冬季生产准备好了七千多万块砖坯，足够各厂用到明年春天解冻以后。各厂还把普通的晾瓦房设备改建为火炕干燥设备，使瓦坯生产在严寒季节里得以照常进行。
