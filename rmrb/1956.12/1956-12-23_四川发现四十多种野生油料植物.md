Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 22nd: This year, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Sichuan Province have newly discovered more than forty kinds of wild oil plants.

The types of wild oil plants in Sichuan Province include litsea cubeba, Xanthoxylum bungeanum seed, buckthorn seed, cocklebur, etc., mostly produced in mountainous areas such as Fuling, Yibin, and Zhongxian. The oil extraction rate ranges from 2.6% to 50%. The extracted oil can be used as fragrance, for consumption, or for lighting. It is estimated that if all these wild plants in the province are utilized, more than three million catties of oil can be produced annually, and one thousand two hundred catties of oil cake fertilizer can be added. Taking litsea cubeba as an example, it grows in alpine weeds and has never been used by the people of Sichuan in the past, but it is a raw material for valuable fragrance oil for export. After it was discovered in Yibin County this year, a batch was transported to Chongqing to be processed into litsea cubeba oil, which has been shipped abroad by the Sichuan Branch of the China Export Company and has been well received.

    四川发现四十多种野生油料植物
    新华社成都22日电　四川省各地供销合作社今年新发现了四十多种野生油料植物。
    四川省野生油料植物种类，有山苍子、黄椒茨籽、马桑子、苍耳子等，大多出产在涪陵、宜宾、忠县等山区。出油率由2.6％到50％。出的油可以用作香料、食用或照明。据估计，全省这些野生植物如全部利用起来，每年可以制油三百多万斤，增加油饼肥料一千二百万斤。以山苍子为例，它产于高山杂草中，过去四川人民从未利用过，而它却是出口的贵重香料油原料。今年在宜宾县发现后，运一批到重庆加工成山苍子油，已经由中国出口公司四川省公司运送出国，颇得好评。
