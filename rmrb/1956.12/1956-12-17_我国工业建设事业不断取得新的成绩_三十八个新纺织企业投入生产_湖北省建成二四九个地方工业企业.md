Xinhua News Agency, December 15th -- From 1953 to the end of November this year, a total of thirty-eight newly built and renovated textile enterprises have been put into production nationwide. Among these thirty-eight enterprises, there are twelve state-owned cotton textile mills, six local state-owned cotton textile mills, ten joint state-private cotton textile mills, and ten state-owned and local state-owned printing and dyeing, linen, silk spinning, and textile machinery manufacturing plants.

Since 1953, the number of new spindles added nationwide has exceeded 1.6 million, equivalent to 28.27% of the original spindles; more than 43,000 looms have been added, equivalent to 57.69% of the original looms. Based on its production capacity, these newly added spindles and looms can spin 1.28 million bales of cotton yarn and weave 1.2 billion meters of cotton cloth annually. With this cotton cloth, every person in the country can receive an average of six Chinese feet of cloth for making clothes.

The twelve newly built and renovated state-owned cotton textile mills, located in Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Xinjiang and other regions rich in cotton, have more than 714,000 spindles and more than 19,000 looms. These twelve cotton textile mills with modern equipment are: State-owned Beijing No. 1 and No. 2 Cotton Textile Mills, State-owned Shijiazhuang No. 1 and No. 2 Cotton Textile Mills, State-owned Zhengzhou No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 Cotton Textile Mills, State-owned Northwest No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 Cotton Textile Mills, State-owned Xinjiang "July 1st" Cotton Textile Mill, and State-owned Jiamusi Cotton Textile Mill.

The six local state-owned cotton textile mills, located in Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Liaoning provinces, have more than 215,000 spindles and more than 3,800 looms. These six local state-owned cotton textile mills include the Local State-owned Shijiazhuang Cotton Textile Mill, the Local State-owned Shanxi Jinhua Cotton Textile Mill, the Henan Yubei Cotton Textile Mill, and the Hunan Xiangtan Cotton Textile Mill.

The ten joint state-private cotton textile mills have more than 118,000 spindles and more than 5,100 looms. These ten mills are located in Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Xi'an in Shaanxi, Nantong in Jiangsu, Wuhu in Anhui, Hangzhou in Zhejiang, and Chongqing in Sichuan.

Currently, twelve newly built cotton textile mills with more than 968,000 spindles and more than 27,000 looms are under construction. Among these twelve textile mills under construction, four factories, including the State-owned Zhengzhou No. 5 and No. 6 Cotton Textile Mills, were originally projects in the Second Five-Year Plan, but construction was started early this year in order to meet the domestic and foreign market demand for textiles sooner and further.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 16th -- In the first four years of the First Five-Year Plan, 249 out of the 263 local industrial enterprises newly built and renovated in Hubei Province have been put into production.

The Hubei region is one of the key areas for industrial construction in China. A considerable portion of the newly developed local industrial enterprises serve national key construction projects. Among them, twenty factories for bricks, tiles, stone, and lime alone were renovated, expanded, and newly built in the past four years. The equipment capacity for producing bricks and tiles this year has increased seventeen times compared to 1949. More than 74% of the brick production is machine-made.

A large portion of the newly developed local industrial enterprises serve agricultural production.

This year, Hubei Province has newly built and expanded 53 agricultural tool repair stations and agricultural machinery factories. The province's capacity to produce agricultural machinery has increased more than five times compared to last year, and it has already produced a large number of new agricultural tools with good quality and low prices for farmers, such as three-pronged weeding hoes, seedling transplanters, and single-row seeders.

In the past four years, Hubei Province has also renovated, expanded, and newly built ninety-one light industrial factories. Compared with 1952, the province's capacity to produce cotton yarn this year has increased by more than 70%, printing and dyeing capacity has increased by 320%, and sugar production has increased by two times. These newly built enterprises can also produce daily necessities for the people that could not be produced in the past.

    我国工业建设事业不断取得新的成绩
    三十八个新纺织企业投入生产
    湖北省建成二四九个地方工业企业
    新华社15日讯　从1953年起到今年11月底，全国已经有三十八个新建和改建的纺织企业投入了生产。这三十八个企业中，有十二个国营棉纺织厂，六个地方国营棉纺织厂，十个公私合营的棉纺织厂，还有十个是国营和地方国营的印染、亚麻、绢纺和纺织机械制造厂。
    从1953年以来，全国新增加的纱锭有一百六十多万枚，等于原有纱锭的28.27％；布机四万三千多台，等于原有布机的57.69％。这些新增加的纱锭和布机，按它的生产能力计算，每年可以纺出一百二十八万件棉纱，织出十二亿公尺棉布；用这些棉布做衣服，全国每人可以平均分到六市尺布。
    分布在我国盛产棉花的河北、河南、陕西和新疆等地区的十二个新建和改建的国营棉纺织厂，拥有纱锭七十一万四千多枚，布机一万九千多台。这十二个拥有现代化装备的棉纺织厂是：国营北京第一、第二棉纺织厂，国营石家庄第一、第二棉纺织厂，国营郑州第一、第二、第三棉纺织厂，国营西北第二、第三、第四棉纺织厂，国营新疆“七一”棉纺织厂和国营佳木斯棉纺织厂。
    分布在河北、山西、河南、湖南、江西和辽宁等省的六个地方国营棉纺织厂，拥有纱锭二十一万五千多枚，布机三千八百多台。这六个地方国营棉纺织厂包括地方国营石家庄棉纺织厂，地方国营山西晋华棉纺织厂，河南豫北棉纺织厂和湖南湘潭棉纺织厂。
    十个公私合营的棉纺织厂拥有纱锭十一万八千多枚，布机五千一百多台。这十个厂分布在河北的石家庄，陕西的西安，江苏的南通，安徽的芜湖，浙江的杭州，四川的重庆等地。
    目前，有九十六万八千多枚的纱锭和二万七千多台布机的十二个新建的棉纺织厂，正在建设。在这十二个正在建设的纺织厂中，国营郑州第五、第六棉纺织厂等四个厂本来是第二个五年计划中的项目，为了尽早地、更进一步地满足国内和国外市场对纺织品的需要，提前在今年动工兴建。
    新华社武汉16日电　在第一个五年计划的头四年中，湖北省新建、改建的二百六十三个地方工业企业，已经有二百四十九个投入了生产。
    湖北地区是我国工业建设重点地区之一。新发展的地方工业企业中有不少的一部分是为国家重点建设工程服务的。其中仅砖、瓦、石料、炼灰等厂，四年中就一共改建、扩建、新建了二十个。今年生产砖瓦的设备能力比1949年增加了十七倍。在砖的生产中有74％以上是机器制造的。
    还有很大一部分新发展的地方工业企业是为农村生产服务的。
    今年湖北省新建、扩建的农具修配站、农业机械厂就有五十三个，全省生产农业机械的能力比去年增加了五倍多，已经为农民生产了三齿耘锄、移苗器、单行条播器等大批质量较好、价格不贵的新农具。
    四年中，湖北省还改建、扩建、新建了九十一个轻工业工厂。同1952年相比，全省今年生产棉纱的能力已经增加了70％多，印染能力增加了320％，糖产量增加了两倍。这些新建的企业还能够生产过去不能生产的人民日用必需品。
