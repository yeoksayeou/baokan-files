Xinhua News Agency, 11th - The Second Chinese Islamic Representative Conference opened today at the Xijiao Hotel in Beijing. The conference is expected to last for ten days.

Nearly 300 representatives are attending the conference, mostly well-known Ahongs, Mullahs, and prominent figures from the Islamic community across the country, representing ten ethnic groups within China. Leaders of the China Islamic Association are also participating. Two Egyptian teachers who teach at the China Islamic Institute of Classics are also invited to participate in the conference.

The conference will summarize the work of the China Islamic Association over the past three years, discuss future tasks, adopt revisions to the association's charter, and elect the second committee of the association.

At the morning session, Nur Muhammad Da Pao Sheng, vice chairman of the China Islamic Association, delivered the opening speech, saying that in recent years, under the leadership and with the help of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the ethnic groups who believe in Islam have been living happy lives. Our religious beliefs have always been respected, protected, and cared for. In areas where ethnic minorities who believe in Islam live, regional autonomy has been implemented, like other ethnic minorities throughout the country, and the right to be masters of our own affairs has been obtained. The economy and culture of the ethnic groups who believe in Islam have also been developed and improved. He said, "We in the Islamic community must, under the glorious light of the religious policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, further unite, redouble our efforts, and contribute all our strength to building our country into a great socialist country."

Before Da Pao Sheng delivered his opening speech, Grand Mullah Han Zhi Se Lai solemnly recited the Koran.

In the afternoon, Burhan Shahidi, director of the China Islamic Association, delivered a report to the conference on "The Work of the China Islamic Association Over the Past Three Years and Opinions on Future Work." In his report, Burhan said that over the past three years, the Islamic Association has strengthened the ties between the Islamic community nationwide through various activities, assisted the government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, founded the Islamic Institute of Classics, organized specialists to study religious doctrines, and published the Koran and other materials as needed. It also organized pilgrimages and visits abroad according to the wishes of people in the Islamic community, successfully completing pilgrimages to the three holy sites of Islam—Mecca, Medina, and Quds. It also invited and received foreign guests from fifteen Islamic countries. These friendly activities have enabled Chinese Islamic believers to establish initial contact with Muslims from various countries, enhancing mutual understanding.

Burhan said that according to the needs of work development, it is necessary to continue strengthening the ties and learning of the Islamic community nationwide, assist the government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief, and strengthen the research of religious doctrines. In the future, it is also necessary to strengthen external contacts and carry out international peace and friendship activities through various means, support the struggle of all oppressed nations for independence, against colonialism, and participate in the struggle of people of all countries to defend world peace. He said, "Now the task of socialist construction in the country is still very arduous. There will be many tasks that our Islamic community should do and various problems that we may encounter. Therefore, we must closely unite around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government and work hard." Burhan's report was unanimously approved by the representatives present.

    新华社11日讯  中国伊斯兰教第二次代表会议今天在北京西郊宾馆开幕。会期预计十天。
    参加这次会议的近三百名代表，大都是全国各地伊斯兰教界的知名阿訇、毛拉和知名人士，包括国内十个民族。参加会议的还有中国伊斯兰教协会的负责人。在中国伊斯兰教经学院任教的两位埃及教师，也应邀参加了会议。
    这次会议将总结中国伊斯兰教协会三年来的工作，讨论今后的工作任务，通过修改伊斯兰教协会会章，选举协会的第二届委员。
    在上午的会议上，中国伊斯兰教协会副主任努尔·穆罕默德·达浦生致开幕词说，几年来，在中国共产党和人民政府领导和帮助下，信仰伊斯兰教的各民族过着幸福的生活。我们的宗教信仰一直受到尊重、保护和照顾。在信仰伊斯兰教各族人民聚居的地方，像全国其他少数民族一样实行了区域自治，获得了当家作主的权利。信仰伊斯兰教各民族的经济和文化也得到了发展和提高。他说，“我们伊斯兰教界必须在中国共产党和毛主席的宗教政策的光辉照耀下，进一步团结起来，加倍努力，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而贡献我们的一切力量。”
    在达浦生致开幕词以前，罕志色来大毛拉庄严地朗诵了古兰经。
    下午，中国伊斯兰教协会主任包尔汉·沙西地罕志，向大会作了“关于中国伊斯兰教协会三年来的工作情况和对今后工作意见的报告”。包尔汉在报告中说，三年来，伊斯兰教协会通过各种活动加强了全国伊斯兰教界的联系，协助政府贯彻了宗教信仰自由政策，创办了伊斯兰教经学院，组织专人研究了教义，根据需要出版了古兰经等；还根据伊斯兰教界人士的愿望，组织了朝觐和出国参观访问，圆满地完成了伊斯兰教三大圣地——麦加、麦地那和古都斯的朝觐，邀请和接待了来自十五个伊斯兰教国家的外宾。这些友好活动，使中国的伊斯兰教信仰者和各国的穆斯林彼此取得了初步联系，增进了相互了解。
    包尔汉说，根据工作发展的需要，今后还需要继续加强全国伊斯兰教界的联系和学习，协助政府贯彻宗教信仰自由政策，加强教义研究工作。今后还必须通过各种方式加强对外联系和进行国际和平友好活动，声援各被压迫民族要求独立、反对殖民主义和参加各国人民保卫世界和平的斗争。他说，“现在国家的社会主义建设任务还很繁重，我们伊斯兰教界应该做的工作和可能遇到的各种问题还会很多，因此我们必须紧密团结在中国共产党和人民政府周围，努力做好工作。”包尔汉的报告，受到到会代表的一致赞同。
