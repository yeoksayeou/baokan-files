    Strive to Fulfill the Task of Increasing Rapeseed Production
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    The rapeseed sowing work in major rapeseed producing areas has concluded. Anhui, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei have all completed or exceeded the state's sowing targets; Zhejiang, Sichuan, and other provinces are close to completing the state's sowing targets. According to statistics from the agricultural department, these provinces have sown more than three million mu of rapeseed this year compared to last year. The state's rapeseed sowing control targets have not been met for several years, and it is truly a good sign that they can be basically completed this year.
    This year, the state appropriately increased the purchase price of rapeseed, which is an important reason why the provinces in the Yangtze River basin completed and came close to completing the rapeseed sowing tasks. For several years, farmers in many rapeseed producing areas have consistently believed that the purchase price of rapeseed was low, and its price ratio to wheat and edible oil was not reasonable enough. Due to the separate adjustments of rapeseed prices in various regions, this unreasonable phenomenon has been changed. Farmers see that growing rapeseed is profitable, so they are willing to grow more rapeseed.
    However, the work of adjusting rapeseed prices in many areas has been done very slowly. Some provinces only determined the purchase price of rapeseed in their regions in mid-to-late October, and did not widely publicize it to the masses of farmers. Some farmers did not even know that the rapeseed purchase price had been increased when they were planting rapeseed. In this way, the measure of adjusting the rapeseed purchase price did not fully play its role in stimulating production in some areas.
    After the rapeseed sowing work is completed, the most urgent task is to strengthen field management and increase yield per unit area. Continuing to publicize the new rapeseed purchase price to farmers will play a significant role in promoting them to strengthen field management. As long as the farmers who grow rapeseed know that the price of rapeseed has increased and that growing rapeseed is more cost-effective than growing wheat, they will think of various ways to manage the rapeseed in the fields well and strive to harvest more rapeseed.
    This autumn, there was widespread drought in the provinces of the Yangtze River basin, and the rapeseed sowing period in many areas was delayed. These rapeseed seedlings are generally weaker and need to be strengthened with nurturing, otherwise some will be difficult to overwinter. Rapeseed in Sichuan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui and other provinces have suffered from varying degrees of insect pests, and measures should be taken immediately to eliminate them.
    Applying topdressing fertilizer during the initial flowering period of rapeseed can significantly increase yield per unit. Sichuan Province has transferred 10,000 tons of chemical fertilizer for rapeseed topdressing, and other provinces are also preparing various fertilizers. This practice of early preparation is worth promoting.

    努力完成油菜籽增产任务
    本报评论员
    各主要油菜产区播种油菜的工作已经结束。安徽、江苏、贵州、湖南、江西、湖北都完成或超额完成了国家的播种指标；浙江、四川等省接近完成了国家的播种指标。据农业部门统计，这些省今年播种的油菜比去年增加了三百多万亩。国家的油菜播种控制指标，几年以来都没有完成，今年能够基本上完成，实在是一种好现象。
    今年国家适当地提高了油菜籽的收购价格，这是长江流域各省完成和接近完成油菜播种任务的一个重要原因。几年以来，许多油菜籽产区的农民，一致认为油菜籽的收购价格较低，它和小麦、食油的比价不够合理。由于各地分别调整了油菜籽价格，这种不合理的现象已经改变，农民看到种油菜有利，就愿意较多地种油菜了。
    但是，不少地区调整菜籽价格的工作做得很慢。有些省份在十月中旬和下旬才确定本地区收购菜籽的价格，而且没有向农民群众作广泛的宣传。有些农民种油菜的时候，还不知道菜籽收购价格已经提高了。这样，调整菜籽收购价格的措施，在部分地区就没有充分发挥刺激生产的作用。
    油菜播种工作结束以后，最迫切的任务是加强田间管理，提高单位面积产量。继续向农民宣传新的菜籽收购价格，对于推动他们加强田间管理，会发挥很大的作用。只要种植油菜的农民都知道菜籽提价了，种油菜比种小麦合算了，他们就会想各种方法，把田里的油菜管理好，争取收获更多的菜籽。
    今年秋季长江流域各省普遍干旱，许多地区的油菜播种期推迟了。这些油菜秧苗一般比较弱小，更要加强培育，否则，有的就难以越冬。四川、江西、湖南、湖北、安徽等省的油菜发生了轻重不同的虫害，应该立即设法加以扑灭。
    在油菜的初花期多施追肥，可以显著地提高单位产量。四川省调到了一万吨化学肥料作油菜的追肥，别的省也在准备各种肥料。这种及早准备的作法是值得提倡的。
