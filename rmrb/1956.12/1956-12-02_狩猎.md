　　Hunting
　　Liu Shengzhi
　　In the primitive forest area of northwestern Sichuan, there are various kinds of wild animals. Some of the Tibetan people who live here make a living by hunting. Whenever the *Yu Mai* in the mountains ripens, the winter highland barley turns golden, and the *Fritillaria* grows strong, wild boars and old bears often come down the mountain to steal crops; leopards and jackals come down the mountain to snatch calves and sheep; *Tetraogallus tibetanus*, weighing more than ten pounds, fly in the mountains to peck at *Fritillaria*; and *Cervus elaphus macneilli*, wild oxen with great strength, and timid roe deer also often appear at the foot of the mountains, running out of sight in an instant. This is the time to hunt.
　　Every day before dawn, the hunters get up from their rock nests, push aside the embers of last night's bonfire, rekindle the fire to boil *Ma Cha* (butter tea), eat a hearty meal of *Tsampa*, and change their straw sandals that were worn out yesterday... Everything is prepared, and the hunt begins.
　　"Bang—Bang—", At this time, if gunshots ring out in the deep valley, it is most likely that someone has intercepted a deer or a musk deer. At the same time, this gunshot often startles those who are unwilling to oversleep.
　　The hunters thus search for prey in the mountain valleys before the sun comes out and the beasts go to sleep. Going towards the high mountains, you will find argali and *Cervus elaphus macneilli*; squatting in the bushes, waiting for wild boars and old bears; going to places with *Fritillaria*, you will surely find fat *Tetraogallus tibetanus*.
　　The sun has come out. The women have squeezed the first milk, and the children carry their schoolbags to school; but the prey in the mountains and forests have gone to sleep. At this time, the hunters' eagle-like sharp eyes search everywhere for traces, turning over one mountain after another, and no one can count how many roads they have walked. When they are hungry, they eat a few mouthfuls of dry *Mo Mo*, and when they are thirsty, they drink a few handfuls of cold water. Sometimes, after running like this for a whole day, the straw sandals are worn out, the feet are pierced, and not a trace of wild animals can be found; but maybe just when you are exhausted, you will suddenly find a leopard den or a wild boar's nest, and shoot it down before it wakes up.
　　On rainy days, the hunters should perhaps take shelter in the rock nests, but they cannot. At this time, some wild animals like to come out for a walk. If it is a snowy day, the hunters should go to make a fire to warm up, but they cannot. Because footprints of wild animals are most easily found on the snow, it is a good time to hunt.
　　If the sky is windy, the hunters will pull a handful of grass from the ground and throw it into the air to see which direction the wind is blowing, so that they can avoid walking into the wind. Because the older generation of hunters often say: *Cervus elaphus macneilli* standing on a high mountain can still see the fish swimming in the stream, and the wind with human smell will startle all kinds of wild animals.
　　On the other side of the mountains, if a *Cervus elaphus macneilli* appears, it often does not have time to notice anything, and the hunters have already spotted it, and before it knows it, it falls down with the sudden gunshot.
　　Meeting a black bear in the deep mountains is a very dangerous thing. It often follows you step by step, so the experienced hunters quickly leave a cloth ball for it to tear, so as to take the opportunity to slip away quietly. If you are unlucky enough to encounter it alone, you have to desperately fire a shot at it and then roll down the rock face to escape from death.
　　Mencius said: "Fish, which I desire; bear's paw, which I also desire. If I cannot have both, I will forgo fish and take bear's paw." It can be seen that bear's paw is more precious than fish, and has been listed as a top dish since ancient times. But in the deep mountains, bear's paw is not a rare thing. For example, when the tense, thrilling and arduous hunting is over, the hunters often light a bonfire in the rock nests and eat a hearty meal of delicious "roasted bear's paw".
　　The night is deep, and perhaps that family is drinking the last tube of hybrid wine around the fire. But in the rock nests in the deep mountains, by the bonfire, the hunters are sleeping soundly with their guns in their arms. But at the slightest sound, they will suddenly wake up, aiming their guns at the place where the sound came from.

　　狩猎
　　刘盛智
    在四川西北部原始森林区里，有各种各样野兽，居住在这里的藏族人民，有的就靠打猎为生。每当山里的玉麦熟了、冬青稞变成一片金黄，贝母正长得结实的时候，常常有野猪、老熊下山偷吃庄稼；豹子和豺狗下山抢走牛崽和羊群；十几斤重的贝母鸡飞翔在山里啄食贝母；还有转瞬就跑得无影无踪的马鹿、力气蛮大的野牛和胆小的獐子也都常出没在山下。这正是打山的时候了。
      每天天还没有亮，猎人们就从岩窝里起来，拨开昨夜篝火的余灰，重新生火熬起马茶，饱吃一顿糌粑，把昨天跑烂了的草鞋换掉……。一切打扎停当，狩猎便开始了。
      “砰—砰—”，这时，如果幽深的山谷里响起了枪声，那多半是谁截获了一只鹿或者是一只麝。同时，这枪声，往往会惊起那些不肯贪睡的人。
    猎人们就这样趁太阳还没有出来，野兽还没有去睡的时候，在山坳里寻找猎物。朝高山走，会找到盘羊和马鹿；蹲在灌木丛里，去等待野猪和老熊；到有贝母的地方去，准有肥壮的贝母鸡。
    太阳出来了。女人们挤过了第一次奶子，孩子们背起书包去上学；但山林中的猎物却睡了。这时，猎人们那如鹰般的锐利眼睛，就到处寻找踪迹，翻完一座山又一座山，谁也数不清走了多少路。肚子饿了，啖下几口干馍馍，口渴了，喝几捧冷水。有时，这样跑了一整天，草鞋跑烂了，脚刺破了，还找不到野兽的一丝踪迹；但说不定正当你走得精疲力尽的时候，会突然发现一个豹穴或野猪窝，趁它还未醒来就一枪把它打翻。
    下雨天，猎人们也许该在岩窝里避一避吧，可是不行。这时候，有些野兽却喜欢出来走走。若是下雪天，猎人们去生火来暖一暖吧，也不行。因为雪地上最易发现野兽
  的脚印，正是打猎的好时光。
      如果天一刮风，猎人们就从地
  上扯一把草，向空中抛去，看风是
  朝那个方向吹，以便好避着风走。
  因为老一辈的猎人常常说：马鹿站在高山上还看得见小溪里的鱼儿游泳，带人味的风会惊走各种野兽。
      在山叠山的那边，如有马鹿出现，它往往还来不及发现什么动静，猎人们早就看准了它，在它不知不觉的时候，就随着突然而来的枪声倒下了。
    在深山里遇上黑熊，那是很危险的事情，它常一步一步跟着你走，所以，老练的猎人，就赶快留下一个布团，让它撕扯，好趁机悄悄溜走。如果不幸一个人突然碰上了它，只好拚命朝它放出一枪后就骨碌碌往山岩下一滚，从死里逃生。
    孟子说过：“鱼，我所欲也，熊掌，亦我所欲也；二者不可得兼，舍鱼而取熊掌者也。”可见熊掌比鱼更珍贵些，从古至今都是被列为上菜的。但在深山里，熊掌并不是什么稀罕之物。比如当紧张、惊险而艰苦的狩猎过去了的时候，猎人们常常在岩窝里烧起篝火，大吃一顿野味鲜美的“火烤熊掌”呢。
    夜深了，说不定有那户人家，正围着火喝完最后一管杂酒呢。但就在深山的岩窝里，在篝火旁，猎人们把枪揣在怀里，已经熟睡。可是一有什么声响，他们便会蓦然醒来，枪口瞄着发出声响的地方。
