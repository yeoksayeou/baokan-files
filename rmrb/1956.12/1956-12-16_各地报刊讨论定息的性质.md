    Discussions on the Nature of Fixed Interest Rates in Various Newspapers and Periodicals

    In the past half year, discussions have been held in various places regarding the nature of fixed interest rates in joint public-private enterprises. Many national newspapers and periodicals have successively organized discussions on this issue or issues related to it. There are mainly three different views on this matter: The first view is that fixed interest is not surplus value; the second view is that fixed interest is surplus value; and the third view is that fixed interest is the capitalists' past exploitation gains, that is, the transformed form of surplus value.

    Fixed Interest is Not Surplus Value

    Those who advocate this view first believe that the generation of surplus value presupposes two conditions: the capitalist ownership of the means of production and labor power as a commodity. Due to the former, capitalists can fully control, dispose of, and utilize their means of production. Due to the latter, capitalists can, by virtue of their ownership of the means of production, seize the surplus labor of workers. However, after the complete public-private ownership of all industries, both of these aspects have undergone fundamental changes. First, among the three rights that capitalists possessed before the implementation of fixed interest, the rights of business management and personnel deployment have been completely transferred to the state. As for the property ownership right, although it has not been completely abolished, this right is only symbolic for capitalists. Besides receiving a certain amount of dividends within a certain period, they cannot control, dispose of, or utilize their means of production, and of course, they cannot use their means of production to seize the surplus labor of workers. That is to say, capitalists and the means of production have actually been separated. Then, how can surplus value still be generated?

    Secondly, the change in the ownership of the means of production has also fundamentally changed the status of capitalists and workers in enterprises. From the perspective of capitalists, by relinquishing the rights of business management and personnel deployment over the means of production, they have acquired the status of ordinary staff members in the enterprise. From the perspective of workers, they have basically become the owners of the means of production and the masters of the enterprise. They do not need to sell their labor power to themselves. The labor they contribute is all necessary labor to meet social needs. In this way, if there is no surplus labor, where does surplus value come from?

    Surplus value is an economic category of capitalist production relations. However, after the complete public-private ownership of all industries, the original capitalist production relations have undergone fundamental changes. Since capitalist ownership of the means of production has been eliminated from production, the law of surplus value has lost the basis for its operation. The state is managing these enterprises in accordance with socialist principles, and the purpose of production is to meet the needs of the people and the country, not to pursue surplus value. That is to say, after the complete public-private ownership of all industries, these enterprises have become socialist in nature. Then, how can the capitalist category of surplus value still be generated in such socialist production relations? Moreover, the fixed interest obtained by capitalists is guaranteed to be received within a certain period, regardless of the enterprise's profits or losses. The organ paying the fixed interest is no longer the enterprise itself, but a certain specialized company. This further illustrates that fixed interest is not surplus value.

    Some people also admit that fixed interest is unearned income and is exploitation. However, exploitation and unearned income are not necessarily surplus value. For example, income such as land rent and bank interest are unearned income, but they are not surplus value. Only under the conditions of capitalist production relations is the capitalist's exploitation income from the working class surplus value. Therefore, fixed interest can only be understood as a price for the redemption of the means of production of the bourgeoisie under the conditions that the working class controls the means of production of the bourgeoisie, and cannot be understood as surplus value.

    Fixed Interest is Surplus Value

    Those who advocate this view believe that capitalists have handed over the rights of business management and personnel deployment of enterprises, but this only indicates the reduction of capitalists' ownership of the means of production, not complete disappearance. On the contrary, the existence of fixed interest reflects the remaining ownership of capitalists, and this dividend income is a kind of exploitation income. If this is not acknowledged, it is equivalent to denying the existence of the bourgeoisie in our country and the existence of class distinctions, and the conclusion must be that our country has finally eliminated the exploiting classes. This statement is obviously inconsistent with the facts.

    It is true that in joint public-private enterprises, labor power is no longer a commodity. However, it cannot be considered that under any circumstances, the surplus labor occupied by the exploiting classes must presuppose labor power as a commodity; nor can it be considered that under any circumstances, capitalist exploitation is manifested as capitalists directly occupying the surplus value of workers. In fact, the exploitative relationship between capitalists and workers still exists. The labor done by workers is not all necessary labor. In addition to necessary labor, they must also do a part of surplus labor, which is gratuitously occupied by capitalists in the form of fixed interest. This gratuitous occupation is the source of fixed interest, which is surplus value. It is incorrect to admit that fixed interest is exploitation income, but that exploitation income is not necessarily surplus value. Of course, not all exploitation income is surplus value, but the capitalist's exploitation income must be surplus value or the transformed form of surplus value.

    If it is considered that the fixed interest income does not depend on the enterprise's profits or losses, and it is guaranteed that capitalists will obtain the same amount of profit, this shows that the part of the value gratuitously occupied by capitalists is not only created by the workers of this enterprise, and therefore, fixed interest is not surplus value. This statement is also untenable. Yes, fixed interest is generally distributed through specialized companies, but regardless of whether it is distributed by specialized companies or other economic institutions, the value distributed can only be the value that the working class has already created. As to whether this part of the value is created by the workers of this enterprise is not important, because from a class point of view, the bourgeoisie always occupies a part of the surplus labor of the working class.

    If fixed interest is simply understood as redemption, and it is considered that capitalists no longer have ownership of the means of production, and dividends are only periodically paid redemption money, and no longer surplus value, this is also inappropriate. In fact, the existence of fixed interest proves that capitalist ownership has not been completely abolished, and it still has economic manifestations. Moreover, our country's redemption policy for capitalists began long before the complete industry-wide joint venture. Redemption is not paid from the state's accumulation, but capitalists are allowed to occupy a part of surplus value for a certain period. No matter how different the past form of "four horses share the wealth" or the current form of fixed interest are, their sources are the same, which is the surplus labor of the working class.

    In addition to the above, among those who advocate this view, there are still two different opinions on the issue of whether the law of surplus value is still playing a role. Most people believe that the basis for the existence of surplus value and the law of surplus value is the capitalist ownership of the means of production. Since this ownership has not been completely eliminated in joint venture enterprises, the law of surplus value is also playing a role. A few people believe that in our country, capitalists can no longer pursue greater surplus value in joint venture enterprises, so the law of surplus value does not play a role at all. Fixed interest is only surplus value when the law of surplus value is not working.

    Fixed Interest is the Transformed Form of the Capitalist's Past Exploitation of the Working Class's Surplus Value

    Those who advocate this view have basically the same arguments as the first view, but their understanding is different. They believe that joint venture enterprises after fixed interest are basically the same as state-owned enterprises. However, capitalists still have dividend income. This income is unearned income and is a part of the value created by the labor of the entire working class (its nature is fundamentally different from the interest income of workers' savings). Although in reality they can no longer use this part of the means of production to exploit workers and create new surplus value, here, fixed interest is only a kind of exchange for the capitalist's capital (partial ownership). And after the capitalists receive this fixed interest, they can only use it for consumption, and cannot transform it into capital again. Their consumption of this fixed interest is actually consuming the money they exploited in the past. After a certain period, the capitalist's fixed interest income is gone, and their partial ownership of the enterprise is also returned to the working class. In this way, the process of capital transforming into fixed interest is also the process of fixed interest being exchanged for the ownership of the enterprise. Therefore, fixed interest is exploitation income and surplus value, but it cannot be understood as today's capitalists' exploitation of the surplus labor of the working class, but should be understood as the transformed form of the capitalists' past exploitation of the working class's surplus value. It is only the working class automatically taking out a part of the ransom as the price for redeeming the bourgeoisie's means of production. (You Ming)

### 各地报刊讨论定息的性质

    各地报刊讨论定息的性质
    近半年来，各地对公私合营企业定息的性质问题，进行了讨论。全国许多报刊先后组织了这一问题或有关这一问题的讨论。对于这个问题的看法，主要的有三种不同的意见：第一种意见认为，定息不是剩余价值；第二种意见认为，定息是剩余价值；第三种意见认为，定息是资本家过去的剥削所得，即剩余价值的转化形态。
    定息不是剩余价值
    主张这种说法的人，首先认为，剩余价值的产生，是以生产资料资本主义所有制和劳动力作为商品二个条件为前提的。由于前者，资本家可以全权支配、处理和运用他的生产资料，由于后者，资本家可以凭借对生产资料的所有权，占有工人的剩余劳动。但是在全行业公私合营以后，这两方面都发生了根本的变化。首先，资本家在定息实行以前拥有的三权中，经营管理权和人事调配权已经完全转移到了国家手中，至于财产所有权虽然还未彻底废除，但这种权力对于资本家来说，只是象征性的存在。除了在一定时期内拿到一定的股息外，他并不能支配、处理和运用他的生产资料，当然更不能够利用他的生产资料来占有工人的剩余劳动。这就是说，资本家和生产资料在实际上已经脱离了关系。那末，怎么还可以产生剩余价值呢？
    其次，由于生产资料所有制的变化，也根本上改变了资本家和工人在企业中的地位。从资本家来说，由于他放弃了对生产资料的经营管理权和人事调配权，就使自己在企业里取得了作为普通工作人员的身份。从工人方面来说，工人已经基本上成为生产资料的所有者，成为企业的主人，他不必要向自己出卖劳动力。他们付出的劳动，都是为满足社会需要的必要劳动。这样，既无剩余劳动，剩余价值又从哪里产生呢？
    剩余价值是资本主义生产关系的一个经济范畴，但是，全行业公私合营后，原来的资本主义生产关系，已经起了根本的变化。由于生产资料资本主义所有制已被排出生产，剩余价值规律已经失去了发生作用的基础。国家已按照社会主义原则来经营管理这些企业，生产的目的是为了满足人民和国家的需要，而不是为了追求剩余价值。这就是说，全行业公私合营之后，这种企业已变为社会主义性质的了。那末，在这种社会主义生产关系中怎么还能够产生资本主义范畴的剩余价值呢？何况，资本家所获得的定息，是不因企业的盈亏，同样保证在一定时期内得到定息收入。支付定息的机关已经不是本企业，而是一定的专业公司。这就更说明定息不是剩余价值了。
    有些人也承认，定息是不劳所得，是剥削。但是剥削和不劳所得，不一定都是剩余价值，例如地租和银行利息等所得，都是不劳所得，但它们不是剩余价值。只有在资本主义生产关系的条件下，资本家对于工人阶级的剥削所得，才是剩余价值。因此，对于定息，只能理解为在工人阶级掌握资产阶级生产资料的条件下，对资产阶级的生产资料实行赎买的一种代价，不能理解为剩余价值。
    定息就是剩余价值
    主张这种说法的人认为，资本家交出了对企业的经营管理权、人事调配权，但这只能表示资本家生产资料所有权的缩小，而不是完全消失。相反地，定息的存在，正是体现着资本家所有权的残存，而这种股息收入，也就是一种剥削收入。如果不承认这一点，就等于否认我国目前尚有资产阶级的存在，尚有阶级的区别，其结论必然是我国已经最后消灭了剥削阶级。这种说法显然是不符合事实的。
    诚然，在公私合营企业里，劳动力已经不是商品。但是，不能认为在任何情况下，为剥削阶级占有的剩余劳动，都是要以劳动力为商品做前提；也不能认为在任何情况下，资本主义的剥削，都表现为资本家直接占有工人的剩余价值。事实上，资本家对工人的剥削关系还存在，工人所做的劳动并不全部都是必要劳动，除了必要劳动之外，还必须做一部分剩余劳动，以定息的形式被资本家所无偿占有。这种无偿占有是定息的来源，也就是剩余价值。如果承认定息是剥削收入，但剥削收入不一定是剩余价值，这种说法是不对的。固然，并不是所有的剥削收入都是剩余价值，但资本家的剥削收入必定是剩余价值或剩余价值的转化形态。
    如果认为定息所得不因企业的盈亏，也保证资本家获得同样多的利润，这就说明，资本家无偿占有的这一部分价值并不仅仅是本企业工人所创造的，因而，定息就不是剩余价值。这种说法也是站不住脚的。是的，定息一般的是通过专业公司来分配的，但是不论由专业公司也好，或由其他经济机构也好，其所分配的价值，只能是工人阶级已经创造出来的价值，至于这部分价值是否由本企业的工人所创造并不重要，因为从阶级观点来看，资产阶级总是占有了工人阶级的一部分剩余劳动。
    如果单单把定息理解为赎买，认为现在资本家已经对生产资料没有所有权了，股息只是定期支付的赎金，而不再是剩余价值。这也是不妥当的。其实，定息的存在，恰恰证明资本主义所有制没有完全废除，它还有经济上的表现。何况，我们国家对资本家的赎买政策，早在全行业合营以前就开始了。赎买，不是用国家的积累来支付，而是允许资本家在一定时期占有一部分剩余价值。不论过去的四马分肥的形式或现行的定息形式是如何不同，但它们的来源是一样，都是工人阶级的剩余劳动。
    除上述外，主张这种说法的人当中，对于剩余价值规律是否还起作用这一问题，仍存在着两种不同的意见。大多数人认为，剩余价值和剩余价值规律借以存在的基础都是资本主义生产资料所有制，既然这种所有制在合营企业中还没有被彻底消灭，那末剩余价值规律也就在起作用。也有少数人认为，在我国，资本家已经不可能在合营企业中追求更大的剩余价值，所以，剩余价值规律根本不起作用。定息只是剩余价值规律不起作用的剩余价值。
    定息是过去资本家对于工人阶级剩余价值剥削的转化形态
    主张这种说法的人，其论据和第一种基本上相同，但理解不同。他们认为定息后的合营企业基本上和国营企业是相同的。但是，资本家仍然有股息收入，这种收入是不劳所得，是剥削整个工人阶级劳动创造的一个部分（它和劳动者的存款利息收入的性质根本不同），虽然实际上他们已经不能再使用这部分生产资料来剥削工人，创造新的剩余价值。在这里，定息只是一种兑换资本家资本（部分所有权）的性质。而资本家拿到这种定息之后，只能把它用作生活消费，不能再转化为资本。他们消费这种定息，实际上就是消费自己过去剥削来的钱。经过一定时期，资本家的定息收入没有了，他的企业部分的所有权也归还工人阶级了。这样，资本转化为定息的过程，也就是定息兑换为企业所有权的过程。因此，定息是剥削所得，是剩余价值，但不能理解为今天资本家对工人阶级剩余劳动的剥削，而应理解为过去资本家对工人阶级剩余价值剥削的转化形态。它只是工人阶级自动地拿出一部分赎金来作为赎买资产阶级生产资料的代价。　　　（右铭）
