    Small Lens
    “Ideological Education”
    There are three people in the office. One is the factory director, one is a cadre from the industrial section, and the other is a young man who has just been transferred to the factory to work as an accountant. The factory director and the cadre from the industrial section are educating him.
    Factory Director: "Do you think there is no future in being an accountant? That's not necessarily the case! The salary of an accounting section chief in the factory is higher than that of a county magistrate."
    The comrade from the industrial section gave even "better" education: "Being an accountant now is not the same as it was a few years ago. Now an accountant can be promoted to accounting section chief..., all the way to a Ph.D. in economics, haha!"

    小镜头
    “思想教育”
    办公室里坐着三个人。一个是厂长，一个是工业科的干部，另一个则是刚调到厂里来做会计工作的青年。厂长和工业科的干部正在对他进行教育。
    厂长：“你认为当会计没有前途吗？其实未必如此！厂里一个会计股长的薪金比县长还高。”
    工业科的同志教育得更“好”：“现在当会计不比早几年了，现在会计可以提升为会计股长……，一直可以到经济学博士，哈哈！”
