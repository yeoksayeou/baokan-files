Xinhua News Agency, Aba, December 19th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Shijin reports: The Third Sub-Delegation of the Central Delegation, which went deep into the northern grasslands of Aba, visited the Tibetan people near Tangke, a newly emerging grassland town on the banks of the Yellow River, and arrived at Langmusi, the source of the Bailong River in the upper reaches of the Jialing River, on the 16th.

On the way from Tangke to Langmusi, a distance of more than 120 kilometers, the delegation was welcomed by herdsmen from the five nomadic tribes of Xiaman, Jiajika, Longwa, Mu, and Ebu, as well as the troops stationed along the route.

Langmusi is an important passage on the border of Sichuan and Gansu provinces.

With the opening of the Xia (He) A (ba) highway and the development of various tasks, Langmusi is becoming more and more prosperous. This small town, which used to have only over a thousand people including lamas from two lamaseries, now has more than two thousand people. Rows of simple new houses have appeared on the slopes of the mountains and riverbeds on both sides of the Bailong River. These are trade shops, the People's Bank, post and telecommunications offices, agricultural and livestock product purchasing stations, and military and government agencies. This year, the state purchased medicinal materials worth more than 60,000 yuan, more than 230,000 jin of wool, and more than 16,000 various animal skins here at prices several times higher than before liberation.

Several Han cadres who have worked here for three or four years told me that some of the residents here were unemployed poor people from other villages before liberation. Now, with the relief and help of the People's Government, they all have jobs and are living a happy and well-fed life. They said that the more than 80 poor households in Rengarma Village alone received more than 1,600 cattle and sheep and some rations and cotton clothes from the People's Government this year.

On the 17th, more than 900 people from all ethnic groups (Tibetan, Han, Hui, and Bao'an) and all walks of life in Langmusi held a meeting on the north bank of the Bailong River to accept the delegation's greetings.

In the afternoon, Genden Monastery on the south bank hosted the delegation with a Tibetan meal in the newly built monastery.

At the banquet, Genden Monastery's Wenbu Niewang Sonam, on behalf of all 500 lamas in the monastery, expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Central Government and Chairman Mao for sending the delegation.

    中央慰问团第三分团
    沿途慰问到达郎木寺
    据新华社阿坝19日电　新华社记者王世晋报道：深入阿坝北部草原的中央慰问团第三分团在黄河岸边慰问了新兴的草原村镇——唐壳附近的藏族人民后，16日来到嘉陵江上游——白龙江源头的郎木寺。
    从唐壳到郎木寺的一百二十多公里的途中，慰问团受到了夏曼、甲机卡、龙哇、穆、俄布等五个游牧部落的牧民以及沿线驻军的欢迎。
    郎木寺是四川省和甘肃省边境的重要孔道。
    随着夏（河）阿（坝）公路便道的通车和各项工作的开展，郎木寺一天天繁荣起来，这个过去包括两座喇嘛寺喇嘛在内只有一千多人的小镇，现在已有二千多人，白龙江两岸的山坡上和河坝里，出现了一排排简朴的新房屋，这是贸易商店、人民银行、邮电局、农牧产品收购站和军政机关，今年国家在这里，用比解放前高几倍的价格，收购了价值六万多元的药材、二十三万多斤羊毛和一万六千多张各种兽皮。
    在这里工作了三、四年的几个汉族干部对我说，这里部分居民是解放以前从外乡来的失业贫民，现在，他们在人民政府的救济和帮助下，都有了工作，过着温饱愉快的生活。他们说，光是仁尕玛村的八十多户贫民，今年就得到了人民政府救济的一千六百多只牛羊和一部分口粮和棉衣。
    17日，郎木寺藏、汉、回、保安各族各界九百多人，在白龙江北岸举行大会，接受了慰问团的慰问。
    下午，江南岸的格尔登寺在新盖的寺院内用藏餐欢宴慰问团。
    宴会上，格尔登寺温布聂旺索纳代表全寺五百多喇嘛对中央和毛主席派来的慰问团表示了衷心的感谢。
