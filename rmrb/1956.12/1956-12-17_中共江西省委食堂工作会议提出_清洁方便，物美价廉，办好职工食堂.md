Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 16th. The Industrial Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a conference to study how to run factory and mine enterprise employee canteens well. Participating in this conference were cooks, canteen management personnel, as well as deputy factory directors and deputy mine directors responsible for employee welfare work from various factories and mines.

The meeting believed that one of the reasons why many factory and mine enterprises had not run employee canteens well was that the leaders of these units did not attach enough importance to this work. Therefore, it was proposed that the leaders of each unit should go deep into the canteen and kitchen like they go deep into the workshop and pithead, and frequently study and improve this work. It is also necessary to organize and mobilize canteen management personnel and cooks to carry out competitions, and regularly evaluate and reward their work achievements.

In response to the current shortcomings of some factory and mine enterprise canteens, such as unclean food, cumbersome procedures for ordering food and buying vegetables, and low quality and high prices of dishes, the meeting demanded that they first achieve thoughtfulness and convenience, cleanliness and hygiene, and then gradually achieve deliciousness and affordability. Factories and mines with the conditions can also raise pigs and grow vegetables themselves to increase non-staple foods.

Before the meeting, the Industrial Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party had organized responsible personnel for employee welfare and model cooks from factories and mines in the province to study the experience of running employee canteens well at the Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory, which runs its canteen well, and introduced it at this meeting.

    中共江西省委食堂工作会议提出
    清洁方便，物美价廉，办好职工食堂
    新华社南昌16日电　中共江西省委员会工业部最近召开了一个研究如何办好工厂矿山企业职工食堂的会议。参加这个会议的有炊事员、食堂管理人员，还有各工厂矿山企业负责职工福利工作的副厂长、副矿长等人。
    会议认为很多工厂矿山企业没有办好职工食堂的原因之一，是这些单位的领导方面对这一工作重视不够。因此，提出各单位的领导人要像深入车间、坑口一样深入食堂、厨房，经常研究和改进这一工作。还要组织和发动食堂管理人员和炊事员开展竞赛，对他们的工作成绩定期进行评比和奖励。
    会议针对目前有些工厂矿山企业的食堂饭菜不清洁，订饭买菜手续过繁，菜的质量低、价格高等缺点，要求先做到周到方便、清洁卫生，再逐步做到美味可口、价钱便宜。有条件的工厂矿山企业还可以自己养猪、种菜，以增加副食品。
    会议以前，中共江西省委员会工业部曾经组织省内工厂矿山企业管理职工福利的负责人员和模范炊事员，到食堂办得好的上海华通开关厂学习办好职工食堂的经验，在这次会议上作了介绍。
