Xinhua News Agency, Mangshi, December 16th. Two sentences spoken by Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe and Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai at the symposium of public leaders of minority nationalities on the Sino-Burmese border held in Mangshi this morning express the relationship between China and Burma and the atmosphere of the symposium. Premier Zhou Enlai said: The nationalities of China and Burma are so close that it is difficult to distinguish them. Prime Minister U Ba Swe said: The people of China and Burma are relatives and close neighbors, and their close exchanges will surely enhance the friendship between the two peoples.

    Today's symposium was conducted in an atmosphere full of friendship and extreme liveliness. After the two Prime Ministers and Deputy Prime Ministers entered the venue, they shook hands with each of those invited to attend the symposium and had free and extensive conversations. Two hundred and twelve Burmese guests and one hundred and thirty Chinese friends, including more than a dozen ethnic groups, sat around together in a mixed pattern. Friends from the two countries had a common ethnic language, and they reunited with their relatives and old friends here. Si Lasha, Deputy Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, and U Zanhta Hsin, Chief Minister of Kachin State in Burma, were classmates in their early years, and both of them were students of Duwa Zaw Lawn, Speaker of the Kachin State Assembly, growing up in the same village in their childhood. When Premier Zhou and Vice Premier He Long talked with them, they congratulated Duwa Zaw Lawn for having such glory. At this small table, Dao Jingban, Governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, also met his relative, U Khun Ohn Kya, the current Burmese County Chief. At another small table, Prince Hu Yutang of the Kawa ethnic group in Cangyuan County and Madame Sao Hkon Hkio, Speaker of the Burmese Chamber of Nationalities, traced back to their kinship. Hu Yutang and the Speaker's wife unanimously said in their conversation with Xie Fuzhi, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: Even after the border is demarcated in the future, the border people of the two countries must still travel freely as before. Ambassador U Hla Maung also made a metaphor. He said: He saw flocks of birds flying from China to Burma in Burma, and also flying from Burma to China, and the people of the two countries should also fly freely like birds.

    Those who participated in today's symposium included the distinguished guests from the Union of Burma who were invited to Mangshi, officials and representatives from Shan State and Kachin State, and representatives from Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and Cangyuan, Lancang and other places in the Yunnan border region.

    中缅边境各族领袖举行座谈会
    新华社芒市16日电　缅甸联邦吴巴瑞总理和我国周恩来总理今天上午在芒市举行的中缅两国边境少数民族公众领袖座谈会上说的两句话，道出了中缅两国的关系和座谈会的气氛。周恩来总理说：中缅两国的民族是如此亲近，以至难分彼此。吴巴瑞总理说：中缅两国人民是亲戚和近邻，他们之间的亲密交往，必将增进两国人民的友谊。
    今天的座谈会是在充满了友情和极为活泼的气氛中进行的。两国总理和副总理进入会场以后，就分别和应邀出席座谈会的人一一握手并作了自由和广泛的交谈。包括十几种民族的缅甸二百十二位客人和一百三十位中国朋友错综地围坐在一起，两国的朋友有着共通的民族语言，他们在这里又重逢了自己的亲人和故友。云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州副州长司拉山和缅甸克钦邦邦长吴赞塔信曾是早年的同学，而他们两人又都是克钦邦议长杜瓦藻朗的学生。幼年时代在同一个村寨长大。周总理和贺龙副总理在和他们交谈中，都以杜瓦藻朗有这样的光荣而向他祝贺。在这一个小桌边，德宏傣族景颇族自治州州长刀京版还遇见了他的亲戚、现任缅甸县长的吴昆翁甲。在另一个小桌边，沧源县佧佤族的斑老王子胡玉堂和缅甸民族院议长萧恢塔夫人回溯起来有着亲戚关系。胡玉堂和议长夫人在和云南省政协主席谢富治交谈中都一致地说：即使将来划界以后，两国的边境人民也依然要如昔地自由往来。同座的吴拉茂大使还作了一个比喻。他说：他在缅甸看见鸟群从中国飞来，也从缅甸飞向中国，两国的人民也应和鸟一样地自由飞翔。
    今天参加座谈会的，包括应邀来到芒市的缅甸联邦贵宾们，掸邦和克钦邦的官员们，代表们，包括来自云南边境西双版纳傣族自治州、怒江傈僳族自治州、德宏傣族景颇族自治州各地和沧源、澜沧等地的代表们。
