　　We Need Cultural Food
　　Langxiang Forestry Area is a remote mountainous area in the southern part of the Lesser Khingan Mountains. Currently, the workers in the forestry area urgently need cultural food.
　　In the past, the Tieling County Xinhua Bookstore mobile book sales team sometimes came to Langxiang, which was very popular with the staff. But now the book sales team has not come for three months, and I heard that this is because they think there are too few people here. The staff has made suggestions many times, but the Tieling County Xinhua Bookstore has turned a deaf ear. We hope that the Tieling County Xinhua Bookstore can listen carefully to the voice of the masses and supply the forestry area workers with cultural food. Sun Degong

　  我们需要文化食粮
    朗乡林区在小兴安岭南部，是一个偏僻的山区。目前，林区工人迫切需要文化食粮。
    过去铁驪县新华书店流动售书组，有时到过朗乡，很受职工欢迎。可是现在售书组已经三个月没有来了，听说这是因为他们认为这里的人少。职工也不知提过多少次意见，可是铁驪县新华书店只当耳旁风。我们希望铁驪县新华书店能够很好倾听群众的呼声，供给林区职工文化食粮。　　孙德功
