Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 19th: In the context of insufficient construction material supply, the 203rd Work Zone of the Chongqing Second Construction Engineering Company has stored more than 1,000 kilograms of wire nails and has enough rebar to ensure the needs of construction projects this winter and next spring. This is not because the 203rd Work Zone prepared more or prepared materials earlier, but because they have a group of material management personnel who are thrifty and not afraid of trouble.

Last year, when the Heping Apartment in the city center, built by this work zone, was completed, the workers pulled out more than two tons of old wire nails from the model boards. Although the work zone straightened the old wire nails and distributed them to the workers for reuse, the workers were unwilling to use them because the nail heads were not sharp. If these old nails were sold to waste recycling stations, the price would be less than one-tenth of the price of new wire nails. Therefore, material clerk Chen Guobin suggested that the work zone buy a small grinder to sharpen the old wire nails. A small grinder only costs 14.5 yuan, and the sharpened wire nails can not only be used by themselves but also support fraternal work zones. Now, in the 203rd Work Zone, a wire nail is often used several times, and the work zone has not bought wire nails for more than a year.

In the fourth quarter of this year, the 203rd Work Zone had a project that required 4 mm rebar. At that time, this type of rebar was unavailable from either the company or the Chongqing Municipal Materials Bureau. After the 203rd Work Zone contacted the construction unit, the construction unit was willing to use their own 6 mm rebar. Although using 6 mm rebar could meet the urgent needs of the project, it would be a waste of steel to use larger materials for smaller purposes. At this time, the deputy director of the work zone's technical department asked Li Qihong, the head of the material group, to roll the 6 mm rebar before using it. Li Qihong contacted the processing plant and found that the processing fee was very expensive, so he wanted to buy his own machine for processing. However, rolling mills were not available at that time. Later, he contacted the Chongqing Supply Station of the Sichuan Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration and exchanged the 6 mm rebar for old 4 mm iron wire dismantled from long-distance telephone lines. After testing by the Chongqing Construction Engineering Administration Bureau's laboratory, this old iron wire could fully meet the needs of the project.

The material management personnel of the 203rd Work Zone also pay attention to saving materials in other work links. Peng Guojun, a material clerk in the Second Work Section, not only distributes materials according to the plan but also borrows the drawings himself and reviews them based on the drawings. This not only avoids material backlog and waste but also prevents work stoppages due to lack of materials.

    精打细算的材料管理员
    据新华社重庆19日电　在建筑材料供应不足的情况下，重庆第二建筑工程公司二零三工区却储存着一千多公斤洋钉；并且有足够的钢筋材料保证今冬明春建筑工程的需要。这并不是二零三工区多准备或早准备了材料，而是因为他们有着一批会精打细算和不怕麻烦的材料管理人员。
    去年这个工区承建的市中心区和平公寓落成的时候，职工们从模型板上拔下的旧洋钉足有两吨多。工区虽然把旧洋钉捶直发给工人重新使用，因为钉头不尖，工人都不愿意用。如果把这些旧钉卖给废品收购站，价格不到新洋钉的十分之一。材料员陈国斌因此建议工区买一部小砂轮来磨旧洋钉。一部小砂轮只要十四元五角钱，磨出来的洋钉不但可以自己用，还可以支援兄弟工区。现在，在二零三工区一颗洋钉往往要使用好几次，工区有一年多没有买过洋钉。
    今年第四季度，二零三工区有一项工程要用四公厘的钢筋。当时，这种钢筋无论从公司还是从重庆市物资局都无法弄到。二零三工区和建设单位联系以后，建设单位愿意把自己的六公厘钢筋拿出来使用。使用六公厘钢筋虽然能应付工程急需，但是大材小用，要浪费许多钢材。这时，工区技术副主任就叫材料组长李启鸿把六公厘的钢筋压延了以后再用。李启鸿和加工厂接洽，发现加工费很贵，便想自己买机器加工。但是，压延机当时又买不到。后来他和四川省邮电管理局重庆供应站联系，用六公厘的钢筋换长途电话线上拆下来的四公厘旧铁线。这种旧铁线经过重庆建筑工程管理局试验室试验，完全可以满足工程需要。
    二零三工区的材料管理人员还在其他工作环节上注意节约材料。二工段材料员彭国钧不只是照计划发料，自己还把图纸借来，根据图纸进行审查，这样不但避免了材料积压和浪费，也防止了停工待料。
