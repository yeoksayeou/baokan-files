Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 7th. A semi-automated lathe copying device was demonstrated on the 6th in the shaft sleeve workshop of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant. It was designed collaboratively by Cheng Kunxiang, a workshop deputy director of worker origin, and engineers Chen Bingshun, Zhou Qin, and others. Over a thousand workers and engineers who attended the demonstration believed that this device could be widely applied in the machinery industry.

Li Boquan, an apprentice who had only been in the factory for six months, was in charge of the demonstration. He placed a previously machined grinding machine spindle with a relatively complex shape into the new copying device. Then, he started the lathe, and the cutting tool automatically moved forward and backward, machining according to the shape of that spindle, skillfully producing a batch of finished products identical to that spindle. On average, each piece took eight minutes, increasing production efficiency by more than double compared to the past. Parts that originally could not be made by workers with low technical skills can now be precisely machined even by apprentices.

Cheng Kunxiang and Zhou Qin are both Shanghai Municipal Labor Models, and Chen Bingshun is also an advanced producer. They saw this kind of copying device on a high-speed lathe at a Czechoslovakian exhibition. After consulting with experts present, they returned and, after nearly a year of research, finally designed and manufactured it successfully.

The Shanghai Machine Tool Plant plans to adopt this new device on all lathes throughout the factory that require its application.

　　车床仿型装置试验成功
    据新华社上海7日电　6日在上海机床厂轴套车间里表演了一种半自动化的车床仿型装置，它是由工人出身的车间副主任程坤祥同工程师陈秉舜、周勤之等合作设计的。到场参观的一千多个工人和工程师们，都认为这种装置可以在机械工业中广泛应用。
    进厂才六个月的徒工李伯铨担任表演。他把一根已经车制好的形状比较复杂的磨床主轴安放到新的仿型装置里，然后开动车床，车刀就按照那根主轴的模样，自动地进退车削，熟练地车出了一批同那根主轴一模一样的成品；平均每根费时八分钟，生产效率比过去提高了一倍多。这种原来技术级别低的工人所不能做的零件，现在连徒工也能够精确地车制出来了。
    程坤祥和周勤之都是上海市劳动模范，陈秉舜也是先进生产者。他们在捷克斯洛伐克展览会上看到一种高速车床上有这种仿型装置，向在场的专家请教以后，回来经过将近一年的研究，终于设计制造成功。
    上海机床厂准备在全厂所有需要应用的车床上，都采用这种新装置。
