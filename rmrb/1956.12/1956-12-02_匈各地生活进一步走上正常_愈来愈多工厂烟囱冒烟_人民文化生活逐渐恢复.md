Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 30th. Life in Budapest and other parts of Hungary is further returning to normal.

　　More than thirty cinemas in Budapest began showing two movies a day on the 29th. Citizens who had not seen a movie for more than a month went to the cinemas with great pleasure. Another forty-five cinemas are ready to open and will be able to show movies as soon as they get enough electricity and fuel. In addition, Kossuth Radio in the capital has started normal broadcasts, including opera, children's programs, and music programs. The long-standing piles of garbage on the city streets have been cleared, and the public bathhouses have also opened.

　　More and more industrial enterprises in Budapest are starting production. The number of workers at work in the factories has now reached 70% to 90%. Those who are not working are only those who live in areas that do not yet have transportation links with the enterprises, or who live outside the city.

　　News of further normalization of life also came from major industrial centers and rural areas across the country. Industrial enterprises in various cities are receiving increasing amounts of coal from the coal regions. However, the lack of fuel and electricity continues to seriously hinder the development of production. Due to the lack of electricity, many companies have had to shorten their work shifts to four to six hours.

　　The broad masses of peasants are working to ensure a good harvest next year.

　　匈各地生活进一步走上正常
　　愈来愈多工厂烟囱冒烟　人民文化生活逐渐恢复
    据新华社布达佩斯30日电　布达佩斯和匈牙利各地的生活进一步走上正常。
    布达佩斯市有三十多家电影院在29日开始每天放映两场电影。一个多月没有看到电影的市民们，十分高兴地走进了电影院。还有四十五家电影院已经准备好营业，一旦得到足够的电力和燃料，就可以放映电影。此外，首都的科苏特电台开始了正常的广播节目，其中有歌剧、儿童节目、音乐节目等。市内各街道上堆积已久的垃圾已经清除了，公共浴池也开放了。
    布达佩斯有越来越多的工业企业开始生产。在工厂里，上工的职工人数现在已经达到70％到90％。没有参加工作的只是那些住在还没有交通工具同企业联系的地区的人，或是住在城外的人。
    从全国各大工业中心和乡村也传来了生活进一步正常化的消息。各个城市的工业企业从煤区得到的煤日益增多。但是，缺少燃料和电力的情况依然严重地妨碍生产的发展。由于缺乏电力，很多企业不得不把工作班缩短为四小时到六小时。
    广大的农民群众正在为着保证明年的丰收而劳动着。
