    Observing Urban Construction Work from Luoyang
    By our correspondent Long Chun

    A Grand Undertaking
    With the desire to understand the emerging field of urban construction, I came to Luoyang, one of the first group of key construction cities in the country.

    First, I visited the Jianxi District. According to comrades who have been in Luoyang for a long time, just over two years ago, there were only a few scattered villages here. But today, five modern large factories are under intense construction, and many tall factory buildings have already been built. Among these factories is the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, which is followed with interest by people across the country. It will form an important machinery industrial base together with the Luoyang Mining Machinery Plant and the Crane Manufacturing Plant. Thousands of employee residences have been completed, and rows of red three-story buildings form more than a dozen neat blocks. The construction of water supply pipelines, sewage pipelines, and roads has been mostly completed. Buses and trucks transporting materials constantly travel on the wide, flat roads. In addition, there are newly built theaters, cinemas, workers' cultural palaces, and the "Shanghai Shopping Center" consisting of various shops relocated from Shanghai. The place is already as lively as a city.

    In the Jiandong District (including the old city of Luoyang), some office buildings, dormitories, and public welfare facilities have also been newly built, and the main roads have been completely renovated. The total length of the newly built water supply and drainage pipelines, power lines, and cables in the city is tens of thousands of meters. The power generation capacity of the power station has been expanded tenfold. Two sites for modern factories have recently been selected in the Jiandong District, one is a cotton textile printing and dyeing joint factory with more than 400,000 spindles, and the other is a glass manufacturing factory producing high-grade glass. A large number of workers are building roads in front of the factories, and large-scale construction will begin next year. In addition, a number of local factories have been newly built in the city, including a machinery factory and a cement products factory relocated from Shanghai.

    In just over two years, a small consumer city has begun to transform into a new type of large industrial city!

    A Comprehensive Art
    When it comes to urban construction work, some people say: Isn't that just building houses and repairing roads?

    In fact, coming to Luoyang to see it will make you feel that it is not that simple. In terms of the business of the urban construction department alone, it includes surveying and mapping, planning, design, municipal engineering, construction management, and many other tasks. In Luoyang City, off-site projects include roads, water supply, drainage, power supply, heating, telecommunications, bridges, flood control, construction, greening, road lighting, and more than a dozen major projects. The construction of a new industrial zone requires the support of all parts of the country and even fraternal countries, and also requires close cooperation among local units. Land requisition and purchase, and other work, are also related to the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, urban construction work needs to be closely linked, and short-term and long-term needs need to be combined with each other. It can be said that urban construction work is a comprehensive art.

    In order to organize such complex work well, first of all, there needs to be unified and strong leadership. Before the large-scale construction began in Luoyang City in 1954, an Urban Construction Committee was established, with the responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee serving as chairmen. It played a significant role in unifying and organizing the city's urban construction work. More importantly, the Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China provided strong leadership for urban construction work.

    The Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promptly studied and handled major issues in urban construction, including some specific issues involving a wide range of areas and of crucial importance. For example, in February of this year, the construction of the water supply and drainage project in the Jianxi District clashed with some temporary sheds on the factory construction site. According to the plan and design, the municipal engineering department requested that these sheds be demolished to build the water supply and drainage project; the construction department disagreed, because demolishing these sheds and building them elsewhere would increase investment and affect construction in the short term. The two sides argued endlessly, and the Municipal Party Committee promptly convened a meeting of all relevant departments to study the issue. Finally, it was decided to demolish the sheds and reorganize the construction force to launch a surprise attack on the water supply and drainage project. As a result, just after the open ditch for draining rainwater was completed in mid-May, there was a heavy rain. Thanks to the timely and correct decision of the Municipal Party Committee, major accidents such as foundation subsidence of factory buildings and residences were avoided during the rainy season.

    This example illustrates the importance of the Party Committee's unified leadership and opposing localism, the importance of uniformly and properly organizing various construction tasks, and also the importance of correctly resolving the relationship between inside and outside the factory and appropriately taking care of current and future needs.

    Appropriately taking care of current and future requirements, and near-term and long-term needs, is a very important issue. To give another example: the design of the water supply and drainage pipeline in the Jianxi District, because the Shanghai design department did not combine it with the long-term vision and leave room for development, it was discovered that the pipeline was too thin before the project was completed. In the future, it will be necessary to waste manpower and material resources to rebuild a set of pipelines side by side. However, to solve the problem of combining the near-term and long-term well, the relevant departments of the central government and various localities need to do a lot of work, such as determining the construction sites of major industrial projects as early as possible, and researching and proposing population quotas suitable for China's specific conditions, and so on.

    To build a new industrial zone well, it is also necessary to arrange the work of commerce, culture, education, health, and other aspects. It is necessary not only to establish various conditions that directly guarantee production, but also to build an environment that can ensure that employees live and produce with peace of mind; it is necessary not only to build factories and mines, but also to simultaneously establish various facilities that a "society" should have. In the past, many departments (including some relevant departments of the central government) did not do enough to comprehensively arrange this work. As a result, the following problems occurred: Commercial and other public service facilities, because the investment and division of labor issues were not resolved, no one built permanent buildings in the neighborhood, so they had to operate in temporary sheds, small wooden houses, and dormitories, creating many difficulties for employees; of course, no one built hotels, inns, etc.; even the establishment of grassroots political power institutions encountered difficulties, because no one built houses for the street offices and police stations here... How to uniformly arrange these tasks, so that the relevant departments can clearly define their responsibilities and coordinate their actions to ensure that each new industrial zone can smoothly "settle down," is an issue that urgently needs to be vigorously resolved by the relevant departments, especially the relevant departments of the central government.

    "Taking care of all aspects" is what a responsible comrade of the Luoyang Urban Construction Committee often says. In Luoyang City, precisely because of the strong support of the relevant departments of the central government, Henan Province, and Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, the Municipal Party Committee and urban construction leading departments often paid attention to taking care of all aspects, properly handled various relationships, and constantly struggled against departmentalism and localism when dealing with problems, which basically guaranteed the smooth progress of urban construction work.

    Down-to-Earth Work
    A comrade from the Luoyang Urban Construction Committee said to me: "Urban construction work is a down-to-earth job, and there must be no sloppiness or subjectivism."

    The actual work situation in Luoyang City proves that this view is correct. For example, when solving the water source problem in the Jianxi District, due to the limitations of machinery and manpower, the situation of groundwater was not explored for a while, and the relevant personnel rashly believed that the amount of groundwater was insufficient, and decided to build a dam and open a canal to divert water from the Luo River. A huge construction plan was completed, and the entire project required an investment of 21 million yuan; moreover, the temperature and composition of the river water did not meet the requirements of industrial water, and it needed to undergo a complex treatment process, and the regular expenses were very large. At this time, fortunately, the relevant departments of the central government insisted on re-drilling for underground water sources, and as a result, it was found that the underground water was very abundant. Therefore, the original design was completely overturned, and the prepared building materials were piled up, and the progress of the water supply project was delayed. The benefit is that the new project saves half the investment and saves the regular expenses of treating river water.

    This is a prominent example of not conducting serious investigation and research and being careless. Such things are naturally not many. In comparison, the struggle between adapting to local conditions and subjectivism is more prominent in the urban construction work of Luoyang City. Among them, the issue of adopting the "peripheral" layout in the neighborhood layout is the most discussed.

    The "peripheral" style is a bit like a "quadrangle courtyard." The entire neighborhood is surrounded by neat buildings. This form of neighborhood is more suitable for living in relatively cold areas like the Soviet Union. But when it is moved to areas like Luoyang with relatively high temperatures, problems arise: There are many west-facing rooms, and it is difficult to work and rest in them in summer.

    The simple adoption of the "peripheral" style in the neighborhood layout in the Luoyang area is a manifestation of the lack of attention to adapting to local conditions by the relevant personnel; it is also a manifestation of paying attention to neatness and aesthetics and not paying enough attention to the suitability of the houses.

    The employee residences built in Luoyang City do not pay enough attention to applicability. Some employees of the First Tractor Factory raised the shortcomings of these residences: First, there are many east and west rooms, which are not easy to live in in summer. Second, most of them are composed of three or four rooms in a "unit," with a washroom and a kitchen, ready to live in by a household. But at present, most employees' families only live in two rooms at most; each "unit" has to be lived in by two or three households. Therefore, this "unit" not only fails to play its original design role, but also creates difficulties: several adults and children live together, and it is very noisy; several households share a kitchen, which is not only crowded, but family members often quarrel over grabbing things.

    Many of these shortcomings are also caused by the lack of experience in the past in all aspects (including many relevant departments of the central government). The Luoyang City urban construction leading organs have paid attention to these issues and decided to continue to pay attention to implementing the principle of adapting to local conditions in future construction, and to oppose subjectivism in planning and design. It is believed that Luoyang City and other places will learn from these lessons and will definitely do a better job in urban construction.

    从洛阳看城市建设工作
    本报记者　龙春
    宏伟的事业
    抱着了解城市建设这项新兴事业的心愿，我来到了全国第一批重点建设城市之一的洛阳市。
    首先参观了涧西区。据久在洛阳的同志说，两年多以前，这里还只有寥寥的几个村落。可是，今天，五座现代化的大工厂正在紧张施工，许多高大的厂房已经修建起来。这些工厂中，有全国人民关注的第一拖拉机制造厂，它将同洛阳矿山机器厂和起重机制造厂等，组成一个重要的机械工业基地。几千间职工住宅已经落成，一排排红色的三层楼房组成十几个整齐的街坊；自来水管道、污水管道、道路的修建工程已经完成大半，公共汽车和运送材料的载重汽车，不断地在宽阔平坦的马路上奔驰。再加上新建的戏院、电影院、工人文化宫和由上海迁来的各种商店组成的“上海商场”，这里已经像都市里一样热闹。
    在涧东区（包括洛阳旧城），也新建了一些办公楼、宿舍和公共福利设施，主要马路翻修一新。全市新修建的上下水管道、电线电缆，长达几万公尺。电站的发电能力扩大了十倍。涧东区最近新选定了两座现代化工厂的厂址，一座是四十多万纱锭的棉纺织印染联合工厂，一座是生产高级玻璃的玻璃制造厂；大批工人正在修建厂前道路，明年就大规模施工。此外，全市还新建了一批地方工厂，其中有从上海迁来的机械厂和水泥制品厂等。
    仅仅才两年多的时间，一个不大的消费性的城市，已经开始形成为一座新型的大工业城市！
    综合的艺术
    提起城市建设工作，有人会说：那还不就是盖房子，修道路呗！
    其实，到洛阳来看看，就会感到可不是那末简单。仅就城市建设部门的业务来说，就包括了勘察测量、规划、设计、市政工程、建筑管理等许多工作。在洛阳市，厂外工程包括道路、上水、下水、供电、供热、电讯、桥梁、防洪、建筑、绿化、道路照明等十几个主要项目。一个新工业区的建设，需要全国各地以至兄弟国家的支援，又需要本地各单位密切协作。征购土地等工作，还关系到工农联盟问题。同时，城市建设各项工作需要紧密衔接，近期远期需要互相结合。可以说，城市建设工作是一门综合的艺术。
    为了把这样复杂的工作组织好，首先就需要有统一的强有力的领导。洛阳市在1954年大规模建设开始以前成立了一个城市建设委员会，由市委和市人民委员会的负责同志任主任委员，它在统一组织全市城市建设工作方面起了不小的作用。更加重要的是，中共洛阳市委员会对城市建设工作进行了强有力的领导。
    中共洛阳市委对于城市建设中的重大问题，包括一些牵涉面广、带关键性的具体问题，都及时研究处理。例如，今年2月间，涧西区上下水工程的建设同工厂工地上一部分临时工棚发生了冲突。市政工程部门按照规划、设计，要求拆掉这些工棚，在这里修建上下水工程；建厂部门不同意，因为拆掉这些工棚到别处另盖，会增加投资，而且短时间内影响施工。双方争执不决，市委便及时召集各有关部门开会研究，最后决定拆掉这批工棚，并重新组织了施工力量，突击修建上下水工程。结果，到5月中旬，排泄雨水的明沟刚完工不久，就来了一场大雨。由于市委及时正确的决定，才避免了厂房和住宅在雨季发生基础下沉等重大事故。
    这个事例，说明了党委统一领导和反对局部观点的重要性，说明了统一妥善地组织各项施工工作的重要性，同时还说明了正确解决厂内厂外关系和恰当地照顾目前和将来需要的重要性。
    恰当地照顾目前和将来的要求、近期和远期的需要，是一个很重要的问题。再举一个例子：涧西区上下水管道的设计，因为上海的设计部门没有结合远景，留出发展余地，现在工程还没有完，就发现管道过细了。将来只好再浪费人力物力，并排地重修一套管道。但是，要很好地解决近期和远期结合的问题，中央和各地的有关部门需要作很多工作，如及早确定重大工业项目的建设地点，研究提出适合中国具体情况的人口定额，等等。
    要建设好一个新工业区，还需要把商业、文教、卫生等其他各个方面的工作安排好。不仅要建立直接保证生产进行的各种条件，同时还要建设一个能保证职工安心生活、安心生产的环境；不仅要建设工厂、矿山，还要同时建立起作为一个“社会”所应具备的各种设施。过去，许多部门（包括中央一些有关部门）对全面安排这方面的工作是作得不够的。结果就发生了这样一些问题：商业等公共服务设施，因为投资、分工问题没有解决，谁也没有在街坊内修建永久性建筑，只好在临时工棚、小木头房、宿舍里营业，为职工造成不少困难；当然，像旅馆、客栈等更没有人修建；甚至于要建立基层政权机构也发生了困难，因为没有人在这里为街道办事处、派出所修建房子……。如何统一安排好这些工作，使各个有关部门都能职责分明、动作协调地保证每个新工业区顺利地“安家立业”，这是亟待各有关部门，特别是中央有关部门大力解决的问题。
    “方方照顾”，这是洛阳城市建设委员会一位负责同志常常说的话。在洛阳市，正是由于在中央、河南省和上海、广州等地各有关部门的大力支援下，市委及城市建设领导部门在处理问题时，经常注意照顾到纵横各个方面，比较恰当地处理了各种关系，并且不断地同本位主义、局部观点进行斗争，才基本上保证了城市建设工作的顺利进行。
    脚踏实地的工作
    洛阳城市建设委员会的一位同志对我说：“城市建设工作，是一项脚踏实地的工作，绝不能有一点马虎，也不能犯主观主义。”
    洛阳市的实际工作情况，证明这种看法是正确的。例如，在解决涧西区水源问题的时候，因为机器人力的限制，一时没有探明地下水的情况，有关人员便轻率地认为地下水数量不足，决定修坝开渠，引用洛河的水。一个庞大的施工计划完成了，整个工程需要投资二千一百万元；而且河水的温度、成分不合乎工业用水的要求，需要经过复杂的处理过程，经常性的开支很大。这时候，幸亏中央有关部门坚持要重新钻探地下水源，结果查明地下水十分充足。于是原来的设计全部推翻，已经准备好的建筑材料积压了下来，上水工程的进度也因而推迟。好处是：新工程节省一半投资，省掉了经常处理河水的开支。
    这是个不认真调查研究、粗心大意的突出的例子。这种事情自然不多。比较起来，在洛阳市城市建设工作中，因地制宜同主观主义的斗争显得更为突出。其中大家谈论最多的是街坊布置中采用“周边式”的问题。
    “周边式”有点像“四合院”。整个街坊由一幢幢整齐的楼房围起来。这种形式的街坊，在像苏联那样比较寒冷的地区，住起来是比较合适的。但是搬到洛阳这样气温相当高的地区来，就发生了问题：朝西的屋子很多，夏天很难在里面工作和休息。
    洛阳地区的街坊布置简单地采用“周边式”，是有关人员对因地制宜注意不够的一个表现；同时也是注意了整齐美观，而对房屋的适用性注意不够的表现。
    洛阳市修建的职工住宅，在适用方面注意得是不很够的。第一拖拉机厂的一些职工提出了这些住宅的缺点：一、东西房多，夏天不好住。二、绝大部分都是三、四间住室组成一个“单元”，有一个盥洗室，一个厨房，准备住一户人家。但是目前一般职工一家最多只住两间；每个“单元”只好由两三户来住。于是这种“单元”不但不能发挥原来设计的作用，反而制造了困难：几户大人、小孩住在一起，吵闹得很厉害；几户伙用一个厨房，不但拥挤，而且家属们还常因抓乱东西而发生争吵。
    这些缺点，许多也是因为过去各方面（包括中央许多有关部门）都缺乏经验所造成的。洛阳市城市建设领导机关已经重视这些问题，决定在今后的建设中继续注意贯彻因地制宜的原则，反对规划、设计中的主观主义。相信洛阳市和其他地方接受了这些教训，一定可以把城市建设工作搞得更好。
