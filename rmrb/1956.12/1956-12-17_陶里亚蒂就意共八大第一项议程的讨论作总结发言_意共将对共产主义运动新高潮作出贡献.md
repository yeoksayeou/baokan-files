Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 16th: TASS reported that when the Italian Communist Party Congress concluded the discussion of the first item on the agenda – "Striving for Italy's Path to Socialism and for a Democratic Government of the Working Class" – on the 13th, Togliatti made a concluding speech. He summarized the discussion and gave a good evaluation of it, saying that the discussion was helpful for the party's development and continued progress.

Togliatti spoke about some criticisms at the congress. He said that the discussion was very free, and we did not hide our weaknesses and shortcomings. However, we also disagree with the attitude of some people who attempt to deny the experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism. This also involves Hungary. We openly and sharply criticized the leaders of the Communist Party of that country, but we cannot but stand on the side of socialism, because otherwise we would be standing on the side of the enemies of socialism.

Speaking of the political unity of the Italian working class, Togliatti said: We cannot pursue a policy that would hinder the merger of the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic Party. We should oppose the opportunist and reactionary stance of the Social Democratic Party, but the Communists cannot act as "superfluous intermediaries" and propose a merger of the three parties.

Togliatti then spoke about international issues. He pointed out the changes that have taken place in the international workers' movement. He said that recently the reactionaries and imperialists have continuously launched dangerous attacks on socialist countries. The enemies are trying to undermine and weaken the socialist camp. It is enough to mention the discussion by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council on the possibility of military intervention in the event of disturbances in socialist countries to prove this point. Togliatti pointed out: Just reading the report of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting is enough to understand the threat that peace is facing. This threat comes especially from West Germany, where the Communist Party was recently banned, and its defense force headquarters is now controlled by militarists and generals from the Hitler era. Therefore, we should be vigilant.

Togliatti said that difficulties cannot conceal the profound and great transformations taking place in the world. Some people do not understand this. He said that the road to socialism is not a flat and comfortable asphalt road. On the road to the victory of socialism, we will encounter many difficulties, and we may have to struggle more than once under unfavorable conditions. We must always use class consciousness as a guide for action. Those who have class consciousness will not be helpless in the face of difficulties.

Togliatti continued, the Italian Communists should make their own contribution to the new high tide of the communist movement. But this contribution should not be manifested in criticism of the work of other political parties. We oppose the local arrogance of other political parties in judging the workers' movement in certain regions. We oppose any international sectarianism that may manifest itself in the workers' movement and incite destructive criticism of other fraternal parties. Our contribution should be to implement correct policies and move forward along Italy's path to socialism better and faster.

Togliatti also talked about the issue of bourgeois freedom in his speech. He pointed out that since bourgeois democracy exists at present, the masses of the people and the Communist Party defend this democracy. The existence of bourgeois democracy is determined by this struggle and by the increasing awareness of the masses. Togliatti criticized those who worship bourgeois democratic freedom, saying that democracy first of all means the participation of the masses of the people in the management of the country. Therefore, the Communist Party's struggle for democracy should be understood in this way.

Togliatti also talked about the issue of conducting research and discussions on some theoretical and practical issues within the party. He pointed out that this research and discussion should help form a fighting and capable revolutionary vanguard. Therefore, we oppose sectarianism and revisionism, we oppose denying or concealing the truth of life, and the broadest debate has been going on within the party. However, it is wrong to demand that various ideas and tendencies be stereotyped. We do not allow the existence of sects and factions within the party. Because this is not innovation, but an obstacle to innovation. Togliatti emphasized that the party should always maintain ideological, political, and action unity.

Togliatti finally said that the discussion on the first item on the agenda was beneficial. The current task is to put the adopted resolutions into practice, implement them into action, and implement them into a more effective struggle to defend peace and democracy.

    陶里亚蒂就意共八大第一项议程的讨论作总结发言
    意共将对共产主义运动新高潮作出贡献
    不同意某些人企图否定苏联经验的态度。反对任何可能在工人运动中表现出国际宗派主义和煽起对其他兄弟党进行破坏性批评的作法。
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党代表大会在13日结束第一项议程——“为意大利走向社会主义的道路、为劳动阶级的民主政府而奋斗”——的讨论的时候。陶里亚蒂作了总结发言。他总结了讨论情况，对这次讨论作了良好的评价，他说这次讨论对于党的发展和继续前进是有帮助的。
    陶里亚蒂谈到大会上的某些批评意见。他说，讨论是十分自由的，我们没有掩饰我们的弱点和缺点。但是，我们也不同意某些人企图否定苏联建设社会主义的经验的态度。这也牵涉到匈牙利。我们公开而尖锐地批评了这个国家的共产党的领导人，但是，我们不能不站在社会主义这一边，因为，否则我们就是站在社会主义的敌人那一边了。
    在谈到意大利工人阶级的政治团结的问题时，陶里亚蒂说：我们不能奉行那种会妨碍社会党和社会民主党合并的政策方针。应当反对社会民主党的机会主义反动立场，但是，共产党人不能当“多余的中间人”和建议三党合并。
    陶里亚蒂接着谈到了国际问题。他指出了国际工人运动中所发生的变化。他说近来反动派和帝国主义者对社会主义国家不断发动危险的进攻。敌人企图破坏和削弱社会主义阵营。只要提一下北大西洋公约组织理事会关于在社会主义国家内发生骚动时进行军事干涉的可能性的讨论就足以证明这一点。陶里亚蒂指出：只要读一读北大西洋公约组织会议的报告，就可以明白和平正面临着怎样的威胁。这种威胁特别是来自西德，在那里，不久前取缔了共产党，它的国防军司令部现在操纵在军国主义者和希特勒时代的将军们的手中。因此我们应当提高警惕。
    陶里亚蒂说，困难掩盖不了世界上所发生的深远的伟大的改造。有些人不懂得这一点。他说，通向社会主义的道路不是平坦舒适的柏油马路。在走向社会主义胜利的道路上，还要遇到不少困难，可能我们还要不止一次地在不利的条件下进行斗争。必须经常以阶级意识为行动指南。谁有阶级觉悟，谁就不会在困难面前束手无策。
    陶里亚蒂继续说，意大利共产党人应当对共产主义运动新的高潮作出自己的贡献。但是这种贡献不应该表现在对其他政党的工作的批评上。我们反对其他政党在判断某些地区的工人运动时抱着地方性的高傲态度。我们反对任何可能在工人运动中表现出国际宗派主义和煽起对其他兄弟党进行破坏性的批评的作法。我们的贡献应该是执行正确的政策，更好和更快地沿着意大利的社会主义道路前进。
    陶里亚蒂在发言中还谈到了资产阶级自由这个问题。他指出，既然目前存在着资产阶级的民主，所以人民群众、共产党就保卫这种民主。资产阶级民主的存在是由这种斗争决定的、是由人民群众认识的提高决定的。陶里亚蒂批评了那些崇拜资产阶级民主自由的人，他说，民主首先意味着人民群众参加对国家的管理。因此，共产党人为争取民主的斗争也就应该这样来理解。
    陶里亚蒂也谈到了关于在党内就一些理论和实际问题进行研究和展开讨论的问题。他指出，这种研究和讨论应当有助于组成一个战斗的、干练的革命先锋队。因此我们反对宗派主义和修正主义，我们反对否认或掩盖生活真相，而党内一直在进行最广泛的辩论。然而要求各种思潮和倾向定型化，那就不对了。我们不允许党内存在宗派和集团。因为这不是革新，而是革新道路上的障碍。陶里亚蒂强调指出，党内应当永远保有思想上、政治上和行动上的一致。
    陶里亚蒂最后说，对第一项议程的讨论是有益的。现在的任务就是把通过的决议付之实行，把它们贯彻到行动中，贯彻到保卫和平和民主的更有效的斗争中去。
