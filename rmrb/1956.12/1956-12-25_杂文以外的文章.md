    Articles Outside of Essays
    Ge Ling
    A certain × Director often praised the essays in the People's Daily, earnestly admonishing his subordinates: "Look! Every word is precious, every needle hits the mark. After reading them, you must examine yourselves three times a day, relate them to reality, and don't become a typical example in those sketches!"

    One day, during a meeting, a comrade offered the × Director some suggestions, and, in accordance with the "admonition" spirit, quoted a certain essay from the People's Daily for analysis. The × Director initially appeared modest and receptive, then showed signs of unease, and finally his anger became apparent. At the end of the meeting, he gave the following instructions to the entire room: "...Since ancient times, no one has been immune to making mistakes. The people who write essays are not sages; how can every one of their articles be good? I have many opinions about those bad essays! Those with good cultivation can still look at them with detachment and criticize them; those with poor cultivation will inevitably parrot others and follow the crowd; those with bad character will take advantage of the opportunity of ‘letting a hundred flowers bloom’ to deliberately cause chaos. I advise these people to read fewer essays, to avoid making mistakes easily! (Suddenly discovering something) – Actually, the reason why an essay is called ‘miscellaneous’ is because it is not a formal article; it doesn't belong to any category. Therefore, it is a sketch, not a classic masterpiece. Those with shallow knowledge and bad ideology should better not read them. – Does anyone have any other opinions?"

    杂文以外的文章
    戈凌
    某×长看了人民日报上的杂文，常常赞不绝口，谆谆告诫部属：“看！真是字字珠玑，针针见血，你们看了之后，一定要做到三省吾身，联系实际，不要成为小品中的典型！”
    一日，会议中某同志给×长提了一点意见，并遵照“告诫”精神，引证了人民日报某篇杂文，加以分析。×长始而虚怀若谷，继而表示不安，最后终于愠形于色。会终，对全场作了如下指示：“……自古就没有不会犯错误的人。写杂文的人不是圣贤，他们的文章那能篇篇都好？我对那些坏的杂文，意见就不少！修养好的，还可以做到熟视无睹，批判地看；修养差的，免不了人云亦云，跟着起哄；品质坏的，就会借百家争鸣之机，有意乱鸣，这种人还是劝他少看杂文为妙，免得容易犯错误！（忽然有所发现地）——其实，杂文之所以为‘杂’，即说明了它不是正文，不属于任何一类。所以它是小品，不是什么经典巨著，才疏学浅，意识不良者，最好不看。——大家还有什么意见？”
