Why Do Audiences Laugh
　　Chen Shouzhu

The Kunqu Opera performance held in Suzhou in late September can be said to be a major event in our artistic endeavors and cultural life. Although I only saw the last five performances, I gained an indelible sense of beauty.

Among the last five performances, there were several comedies. For example, Yu Zhenfei's "The Kite's Erroneous Match" in the "Surprise at the Ugly" and "Subsequent Marriage", "The Roar of the Lion" in the "Kneeling by the Pool", "The Tale of Selling Horses" in the "Writing a Lawsuit" and "Three Pulls", and Wang Chuansong's "Writing a Lawsuit" all elicited laughter from the entire audience. The audience's laughter took various forms: everyone used their eyes and ears, focused on the stage, listening and watching the actors' every word and action, suddenly feeling very funny and unexpected, and then laughed. Sometimes, it was like children setting off firecrackers, first lighting the fuse, anticipating that it would bloom in a moment, and waiting with nervous anticipation, holding their breath until the actors indeed said that sentence and made that action, like the firecracker's fuse burning the gunpowder, and then the whole audience burst into laughter. At other times, the theater was quiet with no laughter, and the audience themselves did not feel like they were laughing; but the audience's joy could not escape the notice of a cold observer, who could see a secret from the corners of their eyes and mouths, that the audience was smiling inwardly. The audience's laughter also contained various contents: some expressed appreciation for the characters' intelligence and talent, some expressed mockery of the characters' ignorance and vanity, and some were satirical of all negative characters and backward phenomena.

So, why do audiences laugh?

Now, let's take "The Kite's Erroneous Match" as an example to explain it briefly. "The Kite's Erroneous Match" is the most performed comedy among Li Yu's Ten Kinds of Music, and has been loved since the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty until now. This performance included the thirteenth scene, "Surprise at the Ugly" and the twenty-ninth scene "Amazed at Beauty," also known as "Subsequent Marriage." Han Qizhong is talented and handsome. Due to the pull of the kite, he admires Zhan Shujuan's talent and beauty, and agrees to meet at the Zhan residence at night; he is convinced that the person who invited him for a secret meeting must be the talented woman he admires, but unexpectedly it is Zhan Aijuan (Shujuan's half-sister), who is not only ugly but also has no talent, so he is shocked and flees. Later, he is arranged by his benefactor to marry a woman from the Zhan family. He assumes that it must be the ugly woman Zhan Aijuan, so he refuses to look at the bride or share the same room with her. When his mother-in-law comes out to inquire and mediate, he realizes that the bride is the beautiful and quiet Zhan Shujuan, and the misunderstanding is resolved. In this performance, Yu Zhenfei plays Han Qizhong, Xu Lingyun plays Zhan Aijuan, Zhu Chuanming plays the mother-in-law Liu, and Zhang Shiyi plays Zhan Shujuan.

The fact that the ugly woman Zhan Aijuan fantasizes about seducing the talented Han Qizhong is a contradiction in itself. Han Qizhong gladly accepts the invitation, and the audience secretly finds it funny. The wet nurse goes out to get a lamp, which is obviously at night, and the characters on stage are groping in the dark, but the audience can see everything clearly. The ugly woman pretends to be a monster, but when the talented man asks her to recite the poem written on the kite, she recites the Thousand Character Classic instead, which shows that she is not only ugly but also has no talent, and her character is not very beautiful. The two first lift the corners of the curtains to cover their faces and make gestures to each other. When the wet nurse enters with a lamp, Han Qizhong "is surprised at the ugly" and flees. All the audience cannot help but burst into laughter. Later, Han Qizhong mistakenly identifies the bride as the ugly woman, which is another contradiction. At the end, his haughty-to-humble manner also makes the audience laugh.

From this, it seems that laughter arises from contradictions: the contradiction between phenomenon and essence, the contradiction between means and ends, the contradiction between the subjective and the objective, and the contradiction between the positive and the negative. As long as it is not too serious and does not lead to sharp conflicts, and can be overcome or even reconciled, it can make people laugh. Due to different kinds of contradictions, there are various kinds of comedies, producing various kinds of laughter.

Each historical period of social life has its own tragedies and comedies. Comedy is a reflection of certain funny, ridiculous, erroneous, and backward phenomena in social life. In the current period of socialist construction, in addition to the heroic deeds and exemplary actions that are admirable and worthy of praise, are there not also many phenomena in various aspects of life that are amusing, ridiculous, and even worthy of ridicule and satire?

Our drama and film audiences and readers of literary works have never been stingy with their emotions. We are willing to shed tears, and we are also willing to laugh. We not only love the comedies of the past, but also yearn for the comedies of the present. We ask artists to reveal the various contradictions in life more boldly and forcefully, more deeply and sharply. Let us laugh, use laughter to praise those pleasing things, and use laughter to satirize those backward things.

### 观众为什么会笑

　　观众为什么会笑
　　陈瘦竹
    9月下旬在苏州举行的昆剧观摩演出，可以说是我们艺术事业和文化生活中的一件大事。我虽然只看了最后五场戏，却得到了一种不易磨灭的美的感受。
    在最后五场演出中，有几出喜剧。如俞振飞主演的“风筝误”里的“惊丑”、“后亲”，“狮吼记”里的“跪池”，“贩马记”里的“写状”和“三拉”，以及王传淞主演的“写状”，都引起了全场观众的笑。观众的笑有各种各样的形式：大家耳目并用，专心致志对着舞台，听着看着演员的一句话一个动作，忽然觉得非常滑稽而且出乎意外，于是就笑了出来。有的时候，又好像小孩放爆竹似的，先点着了引线，预想到等一下就要开花，就怀着紧张的心情，屏息等待，等到演员果然说了那一句话，做了那一个动作，如同爆竹的引线烧着了火药，于是哗地一声全场大笑起来。还有一些时候，剧场里静静地没有什么笑声，观众自己也不觉得在笑；可是观众的喜悦却瞒不过一个冷眼旁观的人，他可以从观众的眉眼间和嘴角旁看出一个秘密，观众的内心在微笑。观众的笑也有各种各样的内容：有的对于剧中人的聪明才智表示赞赏，有的对于剧中人的愚昧虚妄表示嘲弄，也有的是对于一切反面人物和落后现象表示讽刺。
    那末，观众为什么会笑呢？
    现在试以“风筝误”为例，稍加说明。“风筝误”是李笠翁十种曲中演出次数最多的一部喜剧，从清朝乾隆年间直到现在，一向被人爱好。这次演出的是其中第十三出
  “惊丑”和第二十九出“诧美”亦称“后亲”。韩琦仲有才学、美丰姿，因风筝的牵引，爱慕詹淑娟的才貌，应约在深夜到詹府相会；他满以为约他密会的人一定是他所爱慕的那个才女，不料却是一个既无才学、貌又丑陋的詹爱娟（淑娟的同父异母姐姐），于是大惊逃出。后来他被恩人作主和詹家女结婚，他以为那一定是丑女詹爱娟，不看新娘一眼，也不肯和她同房。等到岳母出来查询调解，他才认清新娘是秀丽淑静的詹淑娟，于是一场误会到此消释。在这次演出中，俞振飞饰韩琦仲，徐凌云饰詹爱娟，朱传茗饰岳母柳氏，张世艺饰詹淑娟。
    丑女詹爱娟妄想勾引才子韩琦仲，本身就是一个矛盾。韩琦仲欣然赴约，观众暗中觉得好笑。乳娘出去拿灯，这分明是在深夜，剧中人在暗里摸索，观众却在明处看得一清二楚。丑女装妖作怪，等到才子要她背出写在风筝上的和诗，她却背起千家诗来，可见她不仅貌丑，而且也无才学，品德又很不美。两人先是各自掀起帐角遮住了脸互相作态，等到乳娘掌灯进来，韩琦仲“惊丑”逃出。所有观众都禁不住哄堂大笑了。后来韩琦仲误认新娘为丑女，这又是一个矛盾。到结尾时，他那前倨后恭的神气，也引得观众笑出声来。
    由此看来，笑产生于矛盾：现象和本质之间的矛盾，手段和目的之间的矛盾，主观和客观之间以及正面和反面之间的矛盾。只要不是十分严重，不致引起尖锐冲突，可以克服甚至和解，都可以引人发笑。由于不同性质的矛盾，就有各种不同的喜剧，产生各种不同的笑来。
    每一历史时期的社会生活，各有其悲剧和喜剧。喜剧是社会生活中某种滑稽可笑、错误落后现象的反映。在目前的社会主义建设时期，除了令人可歌可泣、可敬可佩的英雄行为和模范事迹而外，各种各样的生活中间不也有很多令人可喜可笑，甚至应该加以嘲弄讽刺的现象吗？
    我们戏剧电影的观众和文学作品的读者，从来不吝啬自己的感情。我们愿意流泪，也愿意笑。我们不仅喜爱过去的喜剧，而且更渴望现在的喜剧。我们要求艺术家们更大胆有力地、更深刻尖锐地揭示生活中的各种矛盾。让我们笑吧，用笑来赞赏那些可喜的事物，用笑来讽刺那些落后的东西。
