    Pretty Words Exposed
    The negotiations on the US-Philippine military base issue lasted nearly four months. Because the United States stubbornly insisted on retaining extraterritorial jurisdiction in the bases, determined to infringe on Philippine sovereignty, the negotiations remained deadlocked. Now the United States has unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment of the negotiations.
    The network of military bases established by the United States around the world is a serious threat to world peace. It has no fewer than forty military bases in the Philippines, most of the major bases located within a hundred miles of Manila. These bases are part of the United States' plan to prepare for war in the Far East and are a tool for controlling the Philippines. The Philippine people and politicians strongly demand the return of the bases. This legitimate demand for sovereignty has developed into a powerful movement. The Philippine Congress recently passed a resolution demanding that the United States grant complete sovereignty and end American extraterritorial jurisdiction in the bases.
    Although the United States had to hold negotiations with the Philippines, the facts show that the United States is not only unwilling to return the bases but also unwilling to give up extraterritorial jurisdiction. This completely exposes the hypocritical face of the United States, which claims to be willing to see the Philippines become an independent and sovereign country.
    The Philippine "Manila Chronicle" pointed out in an editorial on October 21: The United States has announced to the world that they respect the sovereignty of the Philippines and are willing to return jurisdiction over every inch of land in the Philippines to the Philippines, but when they are asked to fulfill this beautiful, propagandistic promise, they would rather be colonialists. This is an insightful remark that reflects the indignant mood of all Philippine patriots.
    In recent years, the US government has said many nice things to the Philippines, and has even used its so-called respect for the independence and sovereignty of the Philippines to publicize to the world that the United States is not a colonial country. However, the US-Philippine base negotiations prove that the United States is the most ferocious and arrogant colonialist in infringing upon the independence and sovereignty of various countries.
    US Military Wants to Stay in Iceland
    The outcome of the US-Iceland negotiations on military bases shows how the United States, regardless of the wishes of the Icelandic people, stubbornly maintains its bases in Iceland.
    In order to maintain its bases in Iceland and to turn Iceland into a springboard for war, the United States has adopted an extremely arrogant attitude towards Iceland. When the Icelandic Parliament passed a resolution on June 28 demanding the withdrawal of US troops from Iceland, Dulles openly declared that the Icelandic Parliament's resolution "has no implementing effect internationally." When the Icelandic government formally notified the United States of the parliament's resolution and requested negotiations, the United States again used the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a shield, instructing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to issue a document "recommending" that US troops continue to stay in Iceland. Dulles shamelessly said: "The United States is not setting up bases in Iceland based on its own demands but as an agent of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." But in fact, the United States is occupying the military bases in Iceland based on the "Defense Agreement" between the two countries that it forced Iceland to sign.
    Now, the US State Department has announced that it has reached an "agreement" with Iceland, ceasing discussion of Iceland's demand for the withdrawal of US troops from Iceland, and US troops will continue to forcibly occupy bases in Iceland. This is obviously the result of the United States exerting strong pressure on a small country. This is a trampling on the sovereignty claims of the Icelandic people. The Icelandic Parliament held elections in June, and the results of the elections showed that the parties advocating the withdrawal of US troops from Iceland won, fully reflecting the firm will of the Icelandic people to safeguard national sovereignty and world peace.
    The Icelandic government's failure to fulfill the resolution of the parliament and the promises made to the people by the ruling party in the election, and succumbing to US pressure, is not in line with Iceland's national interests.

　　·国际简评·
    漂亮话揭穿了
    美菲军事基地问题的谈判，历时近四个月。由于美国蛮横地坚持保留在基地的治外法权，决心侵犯菲律宾的主权，使谈判一直陷于僵局，现在美国更片面宣布谈判无限期休会了。
    美国在世界各地建立的军事基地网，是对世界和平的严重威胁。它在菲律宾的军事基地不下四十处之多，其中大部分的主要基地设在马尼拉周围一百英里之内。这些基地，是美国在远东准备战争的计划的组成部分，并且是控制菲律宾的一个工具。菲律宾人民和政界人士强烈要求归还基地，这个正当的主权要求已发展成为强大的运动。菲律宾国会最近通过决议，要求美国给予完全的主权，结束美国在基地的治外法权。
    美国虽然不得不同菲律宾举行谈判，但事实表明美国不仅不肯归还基地，而且连治外法权也不肯放弃。这就彻底地暴露了美国口口声声说什么愿意看到菲律宾成为一个独立主权国家的伪善面孔。
    菲律宾“马尼拉纪事报”在10月21日的社论中就已指出：美国向全世界宣布，他们尊重菲律宾的主权，愿意把菲律宾每一英寸土地上的裁判权还给菲律宾，但是，当要他们履行这种漂亮的宣传性的诺言的时候，他们就宁愿成为殖民主义者。这是一针见血的言论，反映了菲律宾一切爱国者的愤慨心情。
    近几年来，美国政府对菲律宾不知说了多少好话，而且还拿它对待菲律宾独立主权的所谓尊重来向世界宣传美国不是一个殖民主义国家。但是，美菲基地谈判证明，美国是最凶恶最蛮横地侵犯各国独立主权的殖民主义者。
    美军要赖在冰岛
    美国同冰岛关于军事基地的谈判结果，表明美国是怎样不顾冰岛人民的愿望，死硬地保持它在冰岛的基地。
    美国为了保持在冰岛的基地，一心要把冰岛变成它的战争跳板，曾对冰岛采取了极端蛮横的态度。6月28日冰岛议会通过要求美军撤出冰岛的决议时，杜勒斯就公然宣称：冰岛议会的这个决议“在国际上是没有实施的效力”。当冰岛政府把议会的决议正式通知美国，并要求举行谈判后，美国又拿出北大西洋公约组织来作挡箭牌，指使北大西洋公约组织发表一个文件，“建议”美军继续赖在冰岛。杜勒斯老着脸皮说：“美国并不是根据它自己的要求而是作为北大西洋公约组织的一个代理人在冰岛设置基地的。”但是，事实上美国是根据它强迫冰岛签订的两国“防御协定”占领冰岛的军事基地的。
    现在，美国国务院宣布说，它同冰岛的谈判已达成“协议”，停止讨论冰岛关于美军撤出冰岛的要求，美军将继续强占冰岛的基地。这显然是美国对小国施展强大压力的结果。这是美国对冰岛人民的主权要求的践踏。冰岛议会曾在6月举行选举，选举结果，主张美军撤出冰岛的党派取得了胜利，充分反映了冰岛人民维护国家主权和世界和平的坚决意志。
    冰岛政府没有履行议会的决议，和执政党在选举中对人民发出的诺言，向美国的压力屈服，这是不符合于冰岛的民族利益的。
