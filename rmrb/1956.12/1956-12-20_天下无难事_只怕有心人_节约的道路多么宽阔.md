    Nothing is Impossible to a Willing Mind
    How Broad is the Road of Thrift!
    More Than Five Thousand "No-Material-Requisition Workdays"
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Workers at the Shenyang Transformer Factory have already completed more than five thousand five hundred "no-material-requisition workdays" from January to November this year, saving raw materials worth more than 65,800 yuan.
    The "no-material-requisition workday" requires workers to accumulate the raw materials they save on weekdays and use them on one workday. Since the workers in the metalworking workshop of the Shenyang Transformer Factory initiated the "no-material-requisition workday" in July last year, it has been enthusiastically supported by workers throughout the factory. At the beginning of this year, all the workers in the factory unanimously proposed to ensure that five thousand "no-material-requisition workdays" would be completed this year. This promise was fulfilled more than a month ahead of schedule.
    Extracting Precious Metals from Waste Materials
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Technicians at the Tianjin Electrolytic Copper Factory are experimenting with extracting five metals—nickel, tin, lead, gold, and silver—and pure crystalline zinc sulfate from waste materials.
    The waste materials in the electrolytic workshop of this factory contain many precious metals. Previously, only crude lead and crude crystalline zinc sulfate could be recovered from these waste materials. If these experiments are successful, it is estimated that next year it will be possible to extract 700 kilograms of silver, 20 kilograms of gold, and about 120 tons of other metals, as well as recover 1,000 tons of pure crystalline zinc sulfate.
    Significant Production Increase Without Reconstruction
　　This Newspaper Dispatch: "We can significantly increase production without reconstruction!" This is the conclusion drawn by the jointly-owned Qiqihar Red Star Auto Repair Factory in formulating its 1957 production plan.
    This factory undertakes automobile repair work for Qiqihar City and some neighboring counties. Forty to fifty cars are sent for repair every day. However, the existing site is narrow, with only a small garage that can accommodate only three cars, and most of the workers work in the open air. The factory has only five old, non-precision lathes, and many parts cannot be manufactured in-house.
    In September of this year, the factory considered that the automobile repair tasks next year would be even more onerous, and it felt that the factory buildings were too small and the equipment was scarce and old. This gave rise to a sense of aversion to the old production environment. Under the influence of this mood, they proposed a large-scale plan to rebuild the factory buildings and add equipment: demolish all existing factory buildings and offices and build a large reinforced concrete garage and a two-story building for both factory and office use. Add thirty-five types of machinery, tools, and instruments, totaling fifty-one pieces (sets). All old machines would be discarded.
    The higher-level leadership rejected this reconstruction plan. At this time, the factory faced an acute problem in arranging the production plan for next year: should they achieve increased production through large-scale reconstruction, or should they realize increased production by tapping potential on the existing basis? The factory adopted the latter path in accordance with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. If the factory buildings and equipment were insufficient, they divided the workers into three shifts to work in rotation. The existing factory buildings, plus the planned new factory buildings of only 600 square meters, could ensure that eight cars were repaired day and night in the warehouse; the utilization rate of machine tools and other tools would also be doubled as a result. In this way, workers would no longer have to crowd in the yard, scrambling for tools to work in the open air.
    If the existing lathes were not precise enough, they planned to buy only one eight-foot lathe next year, specializing in the manufacture of parts requiring strict precision; at the same time, install an electric roller and grinding wheel on this lathe, which could also replace a grinder. Various parts that cannot be manufactured in-house would be solved through cooperation with fraternal enterprises. At present, the factory has signed purchase contracts for fifty-nine types, totaling 119,700 pieces, with the jointly-owned Qiqihar ChunGuang Machinery Factory.
    After various potentials were tapped, the factory concluded: it is possible to increase production significantly without reconstruction. Comparing the requirements for reconstruction with the tapping of potential, if both increase the output value by 2.7 times compared with this year, the former would require a national investment of 518,000 yuan, while the latter would only require 50,000 yuan.

    天下无难事  只怕有心人
    节约的道路多么宽阔
    五千多个不领料工作日
    据新华社讯　沈阳变压器厂职工从今年1月到11月已经做了五千五百多个“不领料工作日”，节约了价值六万五千八百多元的原材料。
    “不领料工作日”要求职工把平日节约下来的原材料积累起来，在一个工作日里使用。沈阳变压器厂的金工车间工人，从去年7月发起做“不领料工作日”以来，得到了全厂工人的热烈响应。今年年初，全厂职工一致提出，保证在今年一年中做五千个“不领料工作日”。这个诺言提前一个多月实现了。
    从废料中提炼贵重金属
    据新华社讯　天津市电解铜厂的技术人员正在试验从废料中提炼镍、锡、铅、金、银五种金属和纯结晶的硫酸锌。
    这个工厂的电解车间的废料里，含有很多贵重金属。以前只能从这些废料中回收粗铅和粗结晶的硫酸锌。现在进行的这些试验成功后，估计明年可以提炼出银子七百公斤，金子二十公斤以及其他金属约一百二十多吨，还可回收纯结晶的硫酸锌一千吨。
    不改建也能大量增产
　　本报讯　“不用改建，也能大量增产！”这是公私合营齐齐哈尔红星汽车修配厂制定1957年生产计划中得出的结论。
    这个工厂承担着齐齐哈尔市和一些邻近县份的汽车修配工作。每天都有四、五十台汽车送来待修。但是现有厂址狭窄，只有一栋仅能容纳三台车的小车库，绝大部分工人露天作业。全厂仅有五台陈旧的、不精密的车床，许多零件不能自制。
    今年9月，该厂考虑到明年汽车修理任务将更繁重，就越发感到厂房太小、设备又少又旧。由此也产生了对旧有生产环境的厌弃情绪。在这种情绪支配下，他们提出了一份大规模的改建厂房和添置设备的计划：把现有的厂房和办公室全部拆除，盖上一栋钢筋混凝土结构的大汽车库和一座厂房兼办公室的二层楼。添置机械、工具、仪器三十五种共五十一台（套）。旧有的机器全部废弃。
    上级领导机关否定了这个改建计划。这时候，该厂安排明年生产计划就面临着一个尖锐的问题：到底是经过大规模的改建实现增产呢，还是在既有基础上挖掘潜力实现增产呢？该厂依照党的八届二中全会精神，采用了后面这条路。厂房和设备不足，他们就把工人分成三班轮流作业。现有的厂房加上计划新建的仅六百平方公尺的厂房，就可以保证有八台汽车在库房里日夜检修；机床和其他工具的利用率，也都因之增加两倍。这样工人们就不用再拥挤在院子里，争抢着工具进行露天作业了。
    既有的车床不够精密，只准备在明年添买一台八呎车床，专门车制精密度要求严格的部件；同时在这个车床上安装电滚和砂轮，还能代替一台磨床用。自制不了的各种部件，通过与兄弟企业的合作来解决。目前该厂已经和公私合营齐齐哈尔市春光机械厂签订了五十九种、计十一万九千七百件的订货合同。
    各项潜力挖掘出来之后，该厂得出了结论：不用改建，也可以大量增产。从要求改建到挖掘潜力，前后比较起来：同样较今年提高产值二点七倍，前者就要国家投资五十一万八千元，而后者只要五万元。
