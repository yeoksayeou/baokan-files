Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 16th:  A dispatch from Kaesong: At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on December 15th, the chief representative of the Korean-Chinese side, Major General Zheng Guolu, strongly protested against the U.S. side's armed personnel once again violating the armistice agreement by intruding into the coastal area north of the military demarcation line, killing, wounding, and abducting civilians. Zheng Guolu demanded that the U.S. side immediately repatriate the abducted civilians, punish those responsible, and guarantee that such incidents do not occur again.

　　At approximately 9:00 PM on December 2nd this year, a team of about eight U.S. armed personnel intruded into Gehang-ri, Ongjin County, Hwanghae Province, and suddenly attacked the residences of peaceful residents, resulting in the death and injury of one farmer each and the abduction of a seventeen-year-old boy named Kim Kwang-soo.  At the site of the attack, there were unexploded U.S.-made rocket shells, bullets, and bullet casings fired by U.S. armed personnel.

　　Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out at the meeting that since the armistice, U.S. armed vessels and armed personnel have continuously and illegally intruded into our waters, coastal islands, and coastal areas, attacking, slaughtering, looting, and abducting our peaceful residents. At the meeting, Zheng Guolu presented the U.S. side with a preliminary list of residents abducted by the U.S. side and emphasized that the U.S. side has a responsibility to repatriate these people to our side.

　　The U.S. side groundlessly claimed at the meeting that the abducted civilians had "fled" to the U.S. side, attempting to distort the facts and evade responsibility.

　　Major General Zheng Guolu refuted the U.S. side's claims based on facts. He also demanded that the U.S. side responsibly investigate this incident and immediately repatriate all the abducted civilians.

    朝中方面代表在军事停战委员会上
    抗议美方劫走和打死北部地区居民
    新华社平壤16日电　开城消息：朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将15日在军事停战委员会会议上严重抗议美方武装人员又一次违反停战协定，侵入军事分界线以北的海岸地区打死、打伤并劫走平民的事件。郑国禄要求美方立即遣返被劫去的平民，并且惩办有关人员，保证此类事件不再发生。
    今年12月2日夜间9时许，约由八人组成的美方武装人员一队侵入黄海南道瓮津郡葛项里，突然袭击和平居民住宅，结果打死打伤农民各一人，劫走十七岁的少年金光洙一人。在被袭击的地方，遗留有美方武装人员发射而没有爆炸的美造火箭炮弹、子弹和子弹壳等。
    郑国禄少将在会上指出，自从停战以来，美方的武装船只和武装人员不断地非法侵入我方海面、沿海岛屿和海岸地区，袭击、屠杀、掠夺并劫走我方和平居民。郑国禄在会上向美方提出一份被美方劫走的居民的初步名单，并且着重指出，美方有责任把这些人遣返给我方。
    美方在会上毫无根据地说被劫走的平民是“逃跑”到美方去的，企图歪曲事实，逃避责任。
    郑国禄少将根据事实驳斥了美方的说法。他并且要求美方负责地对这次事件进行调查，立即全部遣返被劫去的平民。
