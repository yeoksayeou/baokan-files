　　Agricultural Cooperatives Should Not Use Large Quantities of Grain to Make and Sell Cooked Food

　　In some areas of Jiangxi Province, agricultural production cooperatives, under the guise of engaging in sideline occupations, use large quantities of grain to make rice noodles, pastries, liquor, boil sugar, and make other cooked foods, which are transported to market towns for sale. The Youyi Agricultural Cooperative in Baihe Township, Xinyu County, made more than 5,000 jin of dry rice noodles, and the Youai Cooperative, which is a grain-deficient cooperative, also made rice wine using more than 1,000 jin of grain. An agricultural cooperative in Jiangdong District used grain to make various non-staple foods such as rice noodles, fried glutinous rice balls, and fried tofu, which were sold at stalls locally and transported to other places. The Sheshan Agricultural Cooperative in Utang Township, Shanggao County, was supposed to sell 60,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, but only planned to sell 40,000 jin, leaving the rest to make rice noodles for sale. It was discovered in Shangrao County that some agricultural cooperatives had opened pastry shops, rice noodle shops, and tofu shops in market towns. The development of this situation has begun to affect the completion of the state's grain purchase tasks and the increase in rural grain sales. If it is not corrected as soon as possible, it will cause more serious consequences. Jiang Zhan

　　农业社不应该用大量粮食做熟食品买卖
    江西省有些地区的农业生产合作社，借搞副业为名，用大量粮食做米粉、做糕饼、烧酒、熬糖和做其他熟食品，运往集镇出卖。新喻县白河乡友谊农业社，做了干米粉五千多斤，友爱社本是缺粮社也做了一千多斤谷的米酒。江东区的一个农业社，用粮食做成米粉、油团子、油豆腐等多种副食品在本地并运往外地摆摊子出售。上高县乌塘乡社山农业社，应该卖给国家六万斤余粮，但是只准备卖四万斤，其余的留下做米粉出售。上饶县发现有一些农业社在集镇上开设糕饼店、米粉店、豆腐店等。这种情况的发展，已开始影响到国家粮食征购任务的完成和农村粮食销售量的增加，如不及早纠正，则会引起更严重的后果。　　江占
