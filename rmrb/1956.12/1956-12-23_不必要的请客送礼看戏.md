    Unnecessary Feasting, Gift-Giving, and Theatre-Going
    To the Editor:
    After the public announcement of the Communiqué of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, extravagant and wasteful phenomena still existed at the conference of advanced statistical workers held by the Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Statistics.

    The leadership of the Bureau of Statistics made a very generous budget for the meeting. For example, although there were only 414 official delegates to the meeting, they budgeted 8,000 yuan for bonuses alone. As a result, the actual bonuses paid out were only 3,600 yuan. What was the remaining money to be used for? A responsible person from the Bureau of Statistics requested approval from the Provincial People's Committee to have a banquet. In accordance with the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the leadership did not agree, but only instructed that a few more dishes could be added, provided that the food expenses did not exceed the budget. However, the responsible person from the Bureau of Statistics did not comply with this instruction. On the evening of November 30th, the Red Building of the Provincial People's Committee was brightly lit, and the seventy square tables arranged were filled with fish and meat, with the sounds of clinking glasses and constant laughter. In addition to the 414 delegates, 183 observers, and several heads of departments and bureaus who came to drink with invitation cards, 49 service personnel from the Bureau of Statistics also participated in the banquet. This banquet, in addition to the original food allowance, wasted 1,050 yuan.

    In the expenditure of the meeting funds, the cost of issuing award flags and certificates alone was 759 yuan, and the cost of giving notebooks as gifts was also 574 yuan, with each official delegate and observer receiving a notebook. The money spent on movies and theatre also amounted to 370 yuan, and the cost of hiring four cars to transport everyone to and from the theatre added nearly 100 yuan to the transportation expenses. In this way, nearly 3,000 yuan (including the extra money spent on the banquet) was wasted in just five days of the meeting.

### 不必要的请客送礼看戏

    不必要的请客送礼看戏编辑同志：
    中共八届二中全会公报公布后，浙江省统计局在召开的统计先进工作者会议上，仍然存在着铺张浪费现象。
    统计局领导方面将会议预算造得很宽。比如，会议正式代表只有四百一十四人，他们把奖金一项就造了八千元的预算，结果，实发的奖金只有三千六百元。剩下这么多的钱干什么用呢？统计局的一位负责人就要求省人民委员会批准他们会餐一次。领导上根据八届二中全会精神，没有同意，只指示可以在伙食费不超支的情况下增添几个菜，可是，统计局负责人并没有遵守这个指示。11月30日的晚上，省人民委员会红楼招待所里灯火辉煌，排列着的七十张方桌上摆满了鱼肉，碰杯声，欢笑声不断。参加会餐的人，除四百一十四个代表、一百八十三个列席代表和几个带着请帖前来吃酒的厅局负责人以外，还有统计局的四十九个大会服务人员。这次会餐，除去原有的伙食补贴之外，浪费了一千零五十元。
    在会议经费的开支上，单会上发奖旗、奖状就花费了七百五十九元，赠送笔记本，也用去五百七十四元，正式代表和列席代表每人都得到个笔记本。看电影、看戏用去的钱也多至三百七十元，再加上雇用四辆汽车来回运送大家看戏，又用去了近百元的交通费。就这样，仅仅五天的会议，就有近三千元（包括会餐多花的钱）被浪费掉了。
