Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 28th: The Daur language work conference, which closed yesterday in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, after eight days of discussion, adopted the Daur written language plan (draft) and a five-year outline plan for promoting Daur language work, as well as a plan for promoting Daur written language work in 1957. The Daur written language will be promoted and popularized in a step-by-step manner within five years.

The Daur written language plan (draft) was formulated by the Daur language investigation group of the Fifth Working Team of the Minority Language Investigation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences after two years of in-depth investigation and research in the Daur ethnic group's inhabited areas across the country. Soviet linguist B.H. Todaeva assisted and guided this work. The Daur written language plan (draft) was printed and distributed to the Daur people and relevant parties for extensive comments.

The Daur ethnic group has more than 50,000 people, mainly distributed along the Nenjiang River in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, near Qiqihar City in Heilongjiang Province, and in Tacheng County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Before liberation, the Daur ethnic group had worked hard for many years to create their own ethnic written language, but this wish was never realized.

Thirty-eight representatives of the Daur ethnic group from all over the country, as well as language experts and language workers from China, the Soviet Union, and the Mongolian People's Republic, attended the Daur language work conference. Representatives of the Dongxiang and Tu ethnic groups from Gansu Province also participated in the conference.

    达呼尔族有了本民族的文字
    据新华社呼和浩特28日电　昨天在内蒙古自治区呼和浩特闭幕的达呼尔语文工作会议，经过八天的讨论，通过了达呼尔文字方案（草案）和推行达呼尔语文工作的五年轮廓规划，以及1957年推行达呼尔文字工作的计划。达呼尔文字将在五年内有步骤地推广和普及。
    达呼尔文字方案（草案）是由中国科学院少数民族语言调查第五工作队达呼尔语调查组深入全国达呼尔族聚居区，经过两年的调查研究后拟订的。苏联语言学专家布·哈·托达叶娃协助和指导了这一工作。达呼尔文字方案（草案）曾印发给达呼尔族人民和有关方面广泛征求意见。
    达呼尔族共五万多人，主要分布在内蒙古的呼伦贝尔盟嫩江两岸一带、黑龙江省的齐齐哈尔市附近以及新疆维吾尔自治区的塔城县境内。解放前，达呼尔族曾经多年为创立自己民族的文字而努力，但是这个愿望一直没有实现。
    出席达呼尔语文工作会议的有全国达呼尔族的代表三十八人以及中国、苏联和蒙古人民共和国的语言专家和语言工作者。甘肃省东乡族和土族的代表也参加了会议。
