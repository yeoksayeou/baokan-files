    A Flourishing Scene in Socialist Countries
    ·Soviet Union·
    Comprehensive Mechanization of Agricultural Production in All Regions
    Soviet experts have formulated plans for the comprehensive mechanization of agricultural production in all regions of the country. The plans stipulate the design and manufacture of 1,126 types of machines, devices, and equipment adapted to various soil and climatic conditions within the country, so that all agricultural sectors can be mechanized.
    According to the aforementioned plans, Soviet designers have designed 473 new agricultural machines and mechanisms this year, and sample tests have been conducted at machine testing stations in different regions of the country. Following the tests, it has been decided to mass-produce or trial-produce 160 of them. Among the newly designed and trial-produced machines are tractors that can automatically adjust row spacing, specially used in cotton fields and other crop fields, tractors with particularly strong horsepower specifically for use in swampy areas, and plows designed according to the requirements of the Maltsev tillage method. In addition, improved seeders for square-cluster planting and row planting of various crops have been manufactured. Among them, the “CKP-18” seeder-cultivator-fertilizer applicator is particularly interesting, as it can perform pre-sowing tillage, as well as sowing, cultivating, and fertilizing crops such as sugar beets.
    In Ukraine, six sets of machines and mechanisms have also been designed and tested to comprehensively mechanize sugar beet harvesting. The test results selected a set of machines that can mechanize everything from digging sugar beets, loading and unloading beet roots, to stacking sugar beets. This will greatly reduce the labor of collective farm members.
    Number of Books Published Ranks First in the World
    The Soviet Union published a total of 25,000 kinds of books for sale last year, while Britain only published 20,000 kinds, the United States only published 12,000 kinds, and France only published 11,000 kinds. The total number of books published in the Soviet Union also exceeds that of other countries. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime until last year, the Soviet Union has published more than 1.2 million kinds of books, with a total print run of more than 18 billion copies.
    ·German Democratic Republic·
    Bumper Harvests, Expanded Foreign Trade
    Although the weather conditions were unfavorable this year, the farmers of the German Democratic Republic still achieved bumper harvests. According to preliminary statistics, the average grain yield per hectare was 25.2 quintals, potatoes - 193.2 quintals, and sugar beets - 388.4 quintals.
    Currently, there are four main forms of agricultural production in the Republic: agricultural production cooperatives, farmer's joint labor associations, socialist state-owned farms (people's estates), and individual economies.
    1956 was a year of continued development and strengthening of the socialist part of agriculture, which currently accounts for one-third of the Republic's total cultivated land area.
    The German Democratic Republic's foreign trade has seen new growth this year: compared with the same period last year, the foreign trade volume in the first eleven months of this year increased by 16%, which is 1.5 billion rubles more than the total trade volume for the whole of last year.
    These achievements are mainly due to the expansion of trade with socialist countries. At present, the German Democratic Republic's trade with socialist countries accounts for almost three-quarters of its total foreign trade volume. In addition, the German Democratic Republic has also signed several new agreements with capitalist countries this year and extended previous agreements.
    Currently, countries such as Egypt, Syria, India, and Lebanon have been playing an increasingly important role in the German Democratic Republic's foreign trade. It is estimated that the German Democratic Republic's trade volume with these countries this year may double compared to last year.
    ·Korea·
    Achievements in the Three-Year Plan
    The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has adopted a decision on the 1957 plan for the development of the national economy. This decision stipulates that in the first year of the first Five-Year Plan (1957-1961), the total industrial output value should increase by 22.2% compared to this year, and the total grain output should increase by 2.5% compared to this year.
    The decision states that this year's total industrial output value plan can be overfulfilled by 10.5%, and the total industrial output value can reach twice that of 1949. The total grain output plan can be overfulfilled by 2%, exceeding the pre-war level. The total industrial output value plan of the Three-Year Plan (1954-1956) can be overfulfilled by 23% by the end of this year.
    People Obtain More Daily Necessities
    Minister of Light Industry of Korea, Mun Man-yuk, said that this year the output of daily necessities by the light industry sector of Korea has exceeded 90% of the pre-war level.
    The output of important products in light industry, such as cotton fabrics, has reached 7.5 times that of 1949, and paper and shoes have reached more than six and five times that of that time, respectively. The variety of products has greatly increased, and the quality has also improved significantly.
    In an article published in "Labor News" on the 27th, Mun Man-yuk said that the total output value of enterprises under the Light Industry Ministry stipulated in next year's economic plan will increase by 28.7% compared to this year, and the total output value of local light industry will increase by 50% compared to this year.
    The article said that by the end of this year, the light industry sector can overfulfill the Three-Year Plan (1954-1956) by 23%. During the implementation of the Three-Year Plan, the light industry sector built modern enterprises that did not exist in Korea in the past, such as the Pyongyang Textile Factory and the Sinuiju Enamel Factory. All other enterprises that were damaged by the war have been restored and put into production.
    ·Vietnam·
    Autumn Rice Output Reaches Record High This Year
    Since the restoration of peace, North Vietnam has had three consecutive bumper harvests of rice, initially solving the food problem.
    The victory of land reform can be seen more clearly from this year's autumn rice harvest. In the past, North Vietnam also had so much land and manpower, but often did not have enough rice to eat. In the past, the lack of rice in North Vietnam was regarded as a matter of course. But today, the relations of production have changed, and the farmers' production enthusiasm has also changed. This year's autumn rice harvest reached more than 4 million tons, exceeding any previous period. This is only an achievement obtained under the conditions that farmers are initially organized and have not yet obtained much improvement in farming techniques.

    社会主义国家一片繁荣气象
    ·苏联·
    各地区农业生产将全面机械化
    苏联专家已经为全国各个地区制定出使农业生产全面机械化的计划。计划规定设计和制造一千一百二十六种适应国内各种不同土壤和气候条件的机器、装置和设备，以便使一切农业部门的工作用机器来做。
    根据上述计划，苏联设计师今年设计了四百七十三种新的农业机器和机械，并且在国内不同地区的机器试验站通过了样品试验。试验以后，已经决定大批生产或试制其中的一百六十种。在新设计和试制的机器中，有可以自动调整行距的专门在棉田和其他一些作物田中使用的拖拉机，专门在沼泽地带使用的马力特别强大的拖拉机，还有一些按照马尔采夫耕作法所要求的条件而设计的犁。此外，还制造了供正方穴播和条播各种农作物的经过改良的播种机。其中“CKP—18”式播种中耕追肥机特别使人感到兴趣，它可以作播种前整地以及播种、中耕和为甜菜等中耕作物追肥等工作。
    在乌克兰，还设计和试验了六套可以使甜菜收获工作全面机械化的机器和机械。试验结果，选出了一套机器，这套机器能够使从挖掘甜菜、装卸甜菜块根到堆垛甜菜的工作都用机械来作。这样将大大地减轻集体农庄庄员们的劳动。
    书籍出版数占世界第一位
    苏联去年共出版了两万五千种发售的书籍，而英国只出了两万种，美国只出了一万二千多种，法国只出了一万一千多种。苏联出版书籍的总数也超过其他国家。自从苏维埃政权建立以来到去年为止，苏联共出版了一百二十多万种书籍，总印数达一百八十多亿册。
    ·民主德国·
    农业丰收，对外贸易扩大
    虽然今年气候条件不好，但是德意志民主共和国的农民还是获得丰收。据初步材料统计，谷物每公顷平均收获量为二十五·二公担，马铃薯——一百九十三·二公担，甜菜——三百八十八·四公担。
    目前共和国有四种主要的农业生产形式；即农业生产合作社、农民共耕常年劳动组合、社会主义的国营农场人民庄园和个体经济。
    1956年是继续发展和加强农业的社会主义部分的一年，目前这一部分占共和国全部耕地面积的三分之一。
    民主德国的对外贸易今年又有新的增长：同去年同期相比，今年头十一个月的对外贸易额增加了16％，比去年全年的贸易总额还多十五亿卢布。
    这些成就的取得，主要是由于扩大了同社会主义国家的贸易。目前，民主德国同社会主义国家的贸易几乎占它的对外贸易总额的四分之三。此外，民主德国今年还同资本主义国家签订了若干新的协定，并且延长了以前的协定。
    现在，在民主德国的对外贸易中，埃及、叙利亚、印度和黎巴嫩等国家已经占有越来越重要的地位。据估计，今年民主德国同这些国家的贸易额有可能比去年增加一倍。
    ·朝鲜·
    三年计划获得成就
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁通过了关于1957年人民经济发展计划的决定。这个决定规定，在这第一个五年计划（1957—1961年）的第一年，工业总产值比今年要增加22.2％，谷物总产量要比今年增加2.5％。
    决定说，今年的工业总产值计划可以超额10.5％完成，工业总产值可以达到1949年的两倍。谷物总产量计划可以超额2％完成，超过战前水平。三年计划（1954—1956年）的工业总产值计划，到今年年底可以超额23％完成。
    人民获得更多的生活用品
    朝鲜轻工业相文万郁说，今年朝鲜轻工业部门的人民生活用品的产量已经超过战前90％。
    轻工业中重要产品如棉织品的产量已经达到1949年的七点五倍，纸张和鞋子分别达到那时的六倍和五倍以上。各种产品的品种大大增加，质量也有显著提高。
    文万郁27日在“劳动新闻”上发表的一篇文章中说，明年经济计划规定的轻工业省所属企业的总产值比今年要增加28.7％，地方轻工业总产值要比今年增加50％。
    文章说，到今年年底，轻工业部门可以超额23％完成三年计划（1954—1956年）。轻工业部门在执行三年计划期间，建成了平壤纺织工厂、新义州搪瓷厂等过去朝鲜没有的现代化企业，其他遭到战争破坏的所有的企业都恢复起来并且投入了生产。
    ·越南·
    今年秋稻产量创最高纪录
    和平恢复以来，越南北方接连三次水稻丰收，初步解决了粮食问题。
    从今年秋稻的丰收可以更清楚地看到土地改革的胜利。过去越南北方也有那样多的田地和人力，但是经常没有足够的大米吃。过去北越缺少大米这件事被看成当然的现象。但是在今天，生产关系改变了，农民生产情绪也改变了。今年秋稻的收获量达四百多万吨，超过了过去任何时期。这还只是农民初步组织起来、在耕种技术方面还没有得到多大改进的条件下获得的成就。
