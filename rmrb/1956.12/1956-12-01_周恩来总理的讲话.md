Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respected Prime Minister, Ladies and Gentlemen:

First of all, please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks to you, Prime Minister, for holding such a grand banquet for us, and for giving us the opportunity to meet with so many distinguished friends.

I feel particularly cordial and excited to be invited to visit our great neighbor, India, once again. We feel cordial because we are already old friends, and coming here is like coming to our own brother's home. We also feel excited because, since my first visit to India more than two years ago, the friendly relations between our two countries have further developed, and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence – Panchsheel – established by our two countries have been supported by many Asian, African, and other countries, and have aroused increasing response worldwide.

Our two countries have not only lived in peace with each other since ancient times, but also, as two ancient civilizations, have continuously enriched and developed their respective cultures through mutual learning. We are very pleased to see that since our two countries achieved independence one after another, our exchanges in economy, culture, and other fields have been developing day by day. The Chinese people have always admired the cultural traditions and creative genius of the Indian people. The Chinese people want to learn from the Indian people with an open mind, just like our ancestor Xuanzang. Every nation in the world has its strengths and deserves to be learned from. If the people of all countries in the world can have the opportunity to concentrate their efforts on creative labor, and through free exchanges, observe and learn from each other, then we will not only see a more brilliant and splendid world civilization, but also world peace can be guaranteed.

The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence do not exclude any country. As the Prime Minister said well at the airport yesterday, we must "put our principles before the world and devote our strength to peace with greater determination." The Five Principles should not only be the guiding principles in the relations between our two countries, but also the universally observed principles by all countries in the world in international relations. Hostile military blocs should be replaced by collective peace; military aggression and threats of force should be replaced by peaceful coexistence of all countries. Only when the relations between all countries in the world are based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can there be lasting world peace. We Asian and African countries unanimously expressed this hope at the Bandung Conference and adopted the "Declaration on the Promotion of World Peace and Cooperation" as the basis for our joint efforts. To realize such hope, we Asian and African countries must strengthen unity, and at the same time, we must unite all peace-loving countries and people in the world. India, as the initiator of the Five Principles, has made outstanding contributions to the cause of safeguarding world peace. China is also willing to provide its share of strength in this common cause.

The vast majority of countries and people in the world demand peace, demand friendship, and demand the promotion and implementation of the Five Principles. Although the cause of peace is encountering certain difficulties and setbacks, these difficulties and setbacks are only temporary. As long as the forces of peace unite and work together, Panchsheel will eventually shine like the sun over the entire earth.

Finally, I propose a toast,

To the prosperity and flourishing of the Republic of India,

To the great friendship between China and India,

To Panchsheel,

To world peace,

To the health of Prime Minister Nehru, leader of the Indian people, defender of world peace, and a good friend of the Chinese people!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

专栏：

　　周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的总理阁下：各位女士，各位先生：
    首先，请允许我向你，总理阁下，表示衷心的感谢，感谢你为我们举行这样盛大的宴会，感谢你使我们有机会同许多尊贵的朋友们会见。
    当我又一次应邀访问我们伟大的邻邦印度的时候，我感到格外的亲切，也感到十分的兴奋。我们感到亲切，因为我们已经是老朋友了，我们来到这里就像来到自己的兄弟的家里一样。我们也感到兴奋，因为自从两年多以前我第一次访问印度以来，我们两国之间的友好关系又有了进一步的发展，我们两国所确定的和平共处的五项原则——潘查希拉——已经得到许多亚非国家和其他国家的支持，并且在世界范围内引起了愈来愈大的响应。
    我们两国不仅自古以来和平共处，而且作为两个文化古国，不断地通过互相学习丰富和发扬各自的文化。我们很高兴地看到，自从我们两国先后取得独立以来，我们两国在经济、文化等方面的来往日益发展。中国人民一向钦佩印度人民的文化传统和创造天才。中国人民要像自己的先人玄奘那样，虚心地向印度人民学习。世界上每一个民族都有它的长处，都有值得学习的地方。如果世界各国人民都能获得机会集中力量从事创造性的劳动，并且通过自由的交往，互相观摩学习，那么我们不仅可以看到更加光辉灿烂的世界文明，而且世界和平也可以得到保证。
    和平共处的五项原则是不排斥任何国家的。总理阁下昨天在机场说得好，我们必须“把我们的原则摆在世界的面前，并且以更大的决心把我们的力量投在和平的方面”。五项原则不仅应该是我们两国关系中的指导原则，而且也应该普遍地成为世界各国在国际关系中所一致遵守的原则。敌对性的军事集团应该为集体和平所代替；军事侵略和武力威胁应该为各国的和平共处所代替。只有世界各国的关系都建立在和平共处的五项原则的基础上，才能有持久的世界和平。我们亚非国家曾经在万隆会议上一致表示了这种希望，并且通过了“关于促进世界和平和合作的宣言”作为我们共同努力的基础。为了实现这样的希望，我们亚非国家必须加强团结，同时我们还必须团结世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民。印度，作为五项原则的倡导国，在维护世界和平的事业中作出了卓越的贡献。中国也愿意在这一共同的事业中，提供它的一分力量。
    世界上绝大多数的国家和人民都要求和平，要求友好，要求五项原则的推广和实施。虽然和平的事业正遭到一定的困难和挫折，但是这种困难和挫折只是暂时的。只要爱好和平的力量团结起来，共同努力，潘查希拉终将会像太阳一样照耀着整个大地。
    最后，我建议，大家举杯，
    为印度共和国的昌盛繁荣，
    为中印两国的伟大友谊，
    为潘查希拉，
    为世界和平，
    为印度人民的领袖、世界和平的保卫者、中国人民的好朋友尼赫鲁总理阁下的健康干杯！
