　　Lodging
　　Huang Qingjiang
    Lodging is a common occurrence on a journey.
    Who would recall such fleeting, ordinary impressions? Yet, who can forget the profound impact that such ordinary events sometimes leave?
    The dusty plains of northern Anhui, dust billowing, covered the oxcarts and travelers' clothes along the road. As the setting sun bid farewell to the travelers, my companion and I, dragging our tired legs, sought lodging in the large straw house of a district office. The dark room, lit by a half-burnt red candle that barely illuminated a corner, had grass mats spread all over the floor. After eating a pot of tofu noodles and burning a pile of vigorous sorghum stalks, we went to sleep, still faintly hearing the sounds of oxcarts unloading and people talking and laughing loudly outside. Yet, we fell asleep. We didn't ask what kind of village this was (maybe we did, but I've forgotten now), nor do I remember the surroundings of the house, but one thing I remember clearly: the next morning, stepping out of the door, the ground was covered in thick frost, a chilling thick frost...
    On a rainy night along the Yangtze River, with no lights, we walked blindly on the muddy road, stumbling and splashing, the cold mud splashing on our trouser legs. Someone led the way, directly to a large temple used as a township office. Entering the door, we turned a corner, feeling for a pillar. Someone asked:
      "Which direction does this house face?"
    "East, I guess." Someone replied.
    Then, we put down our bundles in this house, searched for nails on the walls, small bricks in the corners, and places to dry our wet clothes outside the window. ...
    But, who remembers which direction this lodging house faced?
    Such ordinary nights of lodging, I can't express how much they have been associated with my youthful experiences.
    One time of lodging, although equally ordinary, stands out remarkably in my memory. That time, three years ago, two female comrades and I stayed in a farmer's house. The host was a kind elder sister. She gave up a bed for the two female comrades. She cooked several bowls of thin porridge and a pot of water for us to wash our feet. Later, she sat in the main room spinning cotton thread, with an oil lamp lit. I thought: in normal times, she probably wouldn't light a lamp at night.
    To her, it seemed like close friends and relatives had come to visit; to me, it felt like staying at a relative's home.
      "Where's your husband?" I asked.
      "He's gone to town."
    "How's your harvest this year?"
      "We have 1.2 mu of cotton fields, and we harvested 300 jin." She said with a smile, "My husband grew it!"
    She praised him like that. I thought: the best pride in the world is no more than this simple, unintentional compliment.
    "Has your family joined the cooperative?"
    "We were going to join Secretary He's cooperative, my husband went to meetings every night for the past few days, but these last two days they haven't asked him to go. The secretary said too many people makes it hard to manage. There are three families here, two without labor, so the secretary decided not to include us three families together."
    I was silent for a moment.
      "You want to join?"
      "We really want to join." She nodded.
      "As long as you want to, you can always join."
    "My husband said the same thing."
    The next day we left, and later we didn't have the chance to go back to this village. Now, three years later, she and that capable farmer must have already joined the cooperative. But for the past two or three years, I have thought of them with a little worry, and with a feeling of affection...
    Such ordinary lodging, unfamiliar encounters. But the various aspects of life are never unfamiliar, never indifferent, never fail to make us remember the sorrows and joys of strangers with great affection!

　　借宿
　　黄清江
    借宿，在旅途中是平常的事。
    谁去追忆那种转眼就过的平常的印象呢？可是，谁又能忘记有时正是这种平常的事引起的深刻的印象呢？
    淮北黄土平原，尘灰滚滚，扑上大路旁的牛车和客人的衣衫。夕阳告别了行人，我和我的同伴拖着疲倦的两腿，在一所区公所的大草房里借宿。暗黑的屋子，点起只能照见一个角落的半支红烛，满地铺下镶草。吃过一锅豆腐面条，烤了一堆旺盛的稖头杆火，随后睡下了，而朦胧中还听见外面有牛车搬卸的声音，还有人高谈狂笑，但还是睡熟了。并没有询问这是个什么庄子
  （也许问过，而现在也忘了），也不记得这座房屋的前后景象，而第二天一早就又上路。只是有一点记得牢牢的，那天一早跨出门来是满地浓霜，令人寒缩的满地浓霜……
    在长江沿岸的一个雨夜，没有灯火，摸黑在泥泞的道路上走着，高一脚低一脚地乱践踏，冰冷的泥水不时溅在裤脚管里。前面有一个人带路，直带到一个乡公所住的大庙里，进门转一个弯，手摸着柱子。前面有人问道：
      “这房子门朝那个方向呀？”
    “门朝东吧。”有人那么答应着。
    而后，我们就在这房子里搁下被包，在墙壁上寻找钉子，在屋角里寻找小块砖石，在窗外寻找晾湿衣裤的地方。……
    但是，谁又记得这借宿过的屋子，是朝什么方向的呢？
    就是这样的平常的借宿之夜，我说不出来它曾关联着我多少青春的经历。
    有一次借宿，虽然同样平常，但在记忆里却奇异地特出。那一次，离今有三年了，我和两个女同志，借宿在一户农家。主人是一位善良的大嫂。她让出了一张床给两位女同志。为我们烧了几碗稀饭，烧了一锅洗脚水。后来，她就坐在堂屋里打棉线，点了一盏油灯。我想：如果在平时，晚上不会点灯吧。
    在她，好像是什么知亲好友来做客的；在我，也似乎觉得是住在自己亲戚的家里。
      “你们当家的呢？”我问。
      “到城里去了。”
    “你们今年收成怎么样呀？”
      “我们一亩二分棉田，收了三百斤。”她微笑着说：“是我当家的种的！”
    她这样赞美。我想：世界上最好的骄傲，也表现不过她这简单的无意的夸奖。
    “你家参加社了吧？”
    “要参加何乡长的社，前几天当家的每晚都去开会，这两天不叫去了，乡长说人多了不好办。我们这里一共三家，两家没劳力，乡长就把我们三家一起不收了。”
    我沉默了一下。
      “你们是想要参加的？”
      “就是想参加。”她点点头。
      “只要自己愿意，总能参加到。”
    “我当家的也这样说的呀。”
    第二天我们就离开这里，后来也没有机会再到这个庄子去。如今三年了，她和那个种田能干的男人，想必早已入社了。但是二、三年来，我却带着一点忧虑想起她们，带着一点亲切的感觉想起她们……。
    就是这样平常的借宿、陌生的相遇。但生活的种种又何曾是陌生的，何曾是冷漠的，何曾不使我们把陌生人的忧愁和欢乐记忆得十分亲切！
