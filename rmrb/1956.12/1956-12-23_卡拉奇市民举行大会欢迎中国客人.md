Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, December 22nd: Premier Zhou Enlai stated at a welcome rally attended by five thousand Karachi citizens on the afternoon of the 21st that he firmly believed "the Chinese people and the Pakistani people must get along more and more amicably day by day." He said that since he and his colleagues arrived here, they had been deeply moved by the friendly feelings shown by the Pakistani people.

Zhou Enlai also said at the citizens' welcome meeting that he saw everywhere in Karachi that the Pakistani people were diligently engaged in construction work; he saw new residences and new factories. He said that this had already left an impression on us and aroused our admiration.

The citizens' welcome meeting was held in a beautiful park. Zhou Enlai delivered his speech from a podium decorated with flags, banners, and colorful light bulbs. His speech drew repeated applause. He emphasized that it was of particular significance for Asian and African countries to maintain friendly unity. He said that colonialists were unwilling to see their interests suffer and had been conspiring to use all methods to restore colonial rule. They were also trying to use some unresolved issues between Asian and African countries to sow discord among these countries, and these unresolved issues were almost all left over from colonial rule. Zhou Enlai pointed out that, as the example of Egypt shows, as long as Asian and African countries stand firm in the struggle against aggression and strengthen solidarity among Asian and African countries and with peace-loving people all over the world, all the colonialists' conspiracies can be defeated. Zhou Enlai quoted the joint statement issued by the Prime Ministers of China and Pakistan during Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to China, saying that China and Pakistan expressed their belief that "with goodwill and sincerity, there is no international dispute that cannot be resolved peacefully."

Zhou Enlai also spoke about the development of friendship between China and Pakistan. He said that Prime Minister Suhrawardy's visit to China had become an important milestone in the development of friendly relations between the two countries. Zhou Enlai hoped that his visit to Pakistan would also help enhance understanding and friendship between the two countries.

Karachi Municipal Commissioner and District Administrator Altaf Gauhar said that Zhou Enlai's visit was "a milestone in the history of friendship and affection between China and Pakistan." He also praised the progress China had made at an astonishing pace.

He explained Pakistan's belief in establishing friendly and sincere relations with all countries in the world while fully respecting their territorial integrity and freedom. He said, "Our motto is 'Peace; promote the progress of mankind.' We hope to plan our future based on Islamic principles."

He also mentioned the Kashmir issue, saying, "Our only demand is for a fair plebiscite."

Premier Zhou Enlai and other Chinese guests walked on carpets from the park entrance to the podium. They walked past tall palm trees, and people from all walks of life applauded and shouted "China-Pakistan friendship Zindabad (Long Live)!" Students threw flower petals at Premier Zhou and put garlands on his head. They also walked past arches modeled after Chinese palaces and Pakistani mosque architecture. Flags, Chinese lanterns, and colored light bulbs were hung everywhere, and checkered carpets were hung on the walls around the garden. When night fell, the roofs, walls, and minarets of the garden hall shone with colorful lights, and the lights were installed in the shape of crescents and stars.

The distinguished guests also watched folk dances, and someone presented Premier Zhou Enlai with a silver model of the garden hall.

Before attending the citizens' welcome meeting, Premier Zhou Enlai and key members of his delegation met with Miss Jinnah, sister of the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Zhou Enlai presented her with gifts of Chinese silk and ivory carvings. Miss Jinnah told Premier Zhou Enlai that China had made rapid progress. Zhou Enlai said that because China has a large population and is backward, the progress is still very little. To this, Miss Jinnah said: "It is good to think this way, because it will always make you want to make more efforts."

    卡拉奇市民举行大会欢迎中国客人
    新华社卡拉奇22日电　周恩来总理21日下午在卡拉奇五千市民参加的欢迎会上说，他坚信“中国人民和巴基斯坦人民一定要一天比一天更加友好地相处下去”。他说，自从他和他的同事们来到这里以后，他们被巴基斯坦人民所表现的友好感情深深感动。
    周恩来在市民欢迎会上还说，在卡拉奇他到处看到巴基斯坦人民正在勤劳地从事建设工作，他看到了新的住宅，新的工厂。他说，这已经给我们留下了印象，并且引起我们的钦佩。
  市民欢迎会在美丽的公园里举行。周恩来是在一个用旗帜、横幅和五彩灯泡装饰得十分漂亮的讲台上发表演说的。他的演说博得多次的掌声。他强调亚非国家保持友好团结具有特殊意义。他说，殖民主义者不愿让他们的利益受到损失，一直在阴谋使用一切方法恢复殖民统治。他们还试图利用亚非国家间一些悬而未决的问题在这些国家中散布不和，而这些悬而未决的问题差不多都是殖民统治遗留下来的。周恩来指出，从埃及的例子可以看出，只要亚非国家在反对侵略的斗争中坚定起来，并且在亚非国家之间以及同全世界爱好和平的人们加强团结，殖民主义者的一切阴谋都是可以击破的。周恩来引用苏拉瓦底总理访问中国期间中巴两国总理发表的联合声明中的话说，中国和巴基斯坦表示相信，“只要具有善意和诚意，没有任何国际争端不能用和平方式加以解决”。
    周恩来还谈到了中国和巴基斯坦之间的友谊的发展。他谈到苏拉瓦底总理到中国的访问已经成为中巴两国友好关系发展中的一个重要标志。周恩来希望他这次对巴基斯坦的访问也将有助于增进两国间的了解和友谊。
    卡拉奇市政专员兼市区行政官阿勒塔弗·高豪尔说，周恩来的访问是“中国和巴基斯坦之间的友好和亲爱的历史上的一个里程碑”。他并且赞扬了中国以惊人的速度所获得的进步。
    他解释了巴基斯坦所持有的这种信念：同世界一切国家建立友好和真挚的关系，同时充分尊重它们的领土完整和自由。他说：“我们的座右铭是‘和平；促进人类的进步’。我们希望根据伊斯兰的原则来规划我们的前途。”
    他还提到克什米尔问题，他说：“我们唯一的要求是举行公平的公民投票”。
    周恩来总理和其他中国客人们从公园进口处走向讲台，沿路都铺有地毯。他们走过高大的棕榈树，各界人士鼓掌和高呼“中国巴基斯坦友好津达巴（万岁）”。学生们纷纷向周总理投掷花瓣，并且把花环挂在他的头上。他们还走过仿照中国宫殿和巴基斯坦清真寺建筑的拱门。到处挂满了旗帜、中国灯笼和彩色电灯泡，花园四周的围墙上挂了格子地毯，当夜幕降临的时候，花园大厅的屋顶、墙壁和尖塔上放出五颜六色的光辉，电灯都是按照新月和星星的样式安装的。
    贵宾们还观看了民间舞蹈，有人把银制的花园大厅的模型赠给周恩来总理。
    在出席市民欢迎会之前，周恩来总理和主要随行人员曾经会见了巴基斯坦创始人穆罕默德·真纳的妹妹真纳女士，周恩来把中国丝绸和象牙雕刻礼物赠送给她。真纳女士对周恩来总理谈到中国进步得很快，周恩来说，由于中国人口多和落后，应该说进步还是很少的。对于这一点，真纳女士说：“这样想是好的，因为这样永远会使你们希望作出更多的努力。”
