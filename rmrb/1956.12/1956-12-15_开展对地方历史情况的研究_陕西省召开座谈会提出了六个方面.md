Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 13th: Zhao Boping, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Acting Governor, proposed six areas for future historical research in Shaanxi Province at a symposium on the study of Shaanxi's local history held on the 7th.

	In the field of literature and art, the work of verifying the origins of Shaanxi local operas, especially Qinqiang and Mei Hu Opera, should be completed. All parties should assist the cultural departments in the research and collation of buildings, sculptures, and unearthed murals from the Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, and other ten dynasties. Everyone can also organize poetry societies and gatherings to collect poems, folk songs, ballads, historical anecdotes, myths, and legends written by poets from "Bin Feng" to the end of the Qing Dynasty. Regarding local customs and figures, we should first study the historical water conservancy facilities and the production of suitable crops in various parts of Shaanxi throughout history, and tentatively focus on studying famous figures such as Wang Jian, Sima Qian, and Li Zicheng. In terms of history, historical sites, places of interest, and unearthed cultural relics, we must combine the unearthed sites and artifacts to study the history of the Zhou, Qin, and Han dynasties in Shaanxi. This is of great significance for solving the periodization of Chinese slave society and feudal society. The revolutionary sacred site of Yan'an and the many major historical events that occurred in Shaanxi from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to the founding of the People's Republic of China should also be studied.

	Zhao Boping proposed the following regarding the organization of research work: the competent authorities should actively mobilize experts to carry out research, and older generation scholars and experts should also inform the relevant authorities of their research achievements at any time. Older generation scholars and experts can form their own groups and gather regularly to conduct research and discussions. Newspapers and periodicals should provide space to publish academic reports, papers, poems, songs, fu, and other works.

	More than 130 people from the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal Research Institute for Culture and History, the Shaanxi Provincial and Xi'an Municipal Counselor's Offices, and various cultural, educational, and health fields attended the meeting. In their speeches, they all believed that studying the history of Shaanxi was a matter of urgency. Some talked about their research experience, some promised to provide research reference materials, and others proposed the topics they wanted to study.

    开展对地方历史情况的研究
    陕西省召开座谈会提出了六个方面
    新华社西安13日电　中共陕西省委员会书记、代省长赵伯平，在7日召开的关于开展对陕西地方历史情况研究座谈会上，提出今后应在六个方面展开陕西省历史研究工作。
    文学艺术方面，应完成对陕西地方戏曲，特别是秦腔和郿鄠剧，进行源流考证的工作。各方面应协助文化部门，对周、秦、汉、唐等十个朝代的建筑物、雕刻和出土壁画的研究和整理工作。大家还可以组织诗社、诗会，收集从“邠风”开始到清末历代诗人写出有关的诗词、民歌、民谣、历史掌故、神话传说。在风土人物方面，应该首先研究历史上各代在陕西的水利设施和各地宜种作物的生产情况和历史，并暂定对王翦、司马迁、李自成等著名人物加以研究。在历史、古迹、名胜和出土文物方面，要结合出土的遗址、器物，研究周、秦、汉三个朝代在陕西的历史。这对解决中国奴隶社会和封建社会的分期问题，有着重大意义。对革命圣地延安和从太平天国到中华人民共和国成立以前，在陕西所发生的许多重大历史事件，也都应当加以研究。
    赵伯平对研究的组织工作提出：各主管机关应积极动员专家，开展研究，老一辈的学者、专家也应随时将研究的成就告诉有关机关。老一辈的学者、专家可以自己分组集会，定期地进行研究和讨论，各报刊应该给以篇幅，刊登学术报告、论文、诗词、歌、赋等作品。
    参加会议的有政协陕西省、西安市委员会，陕西省、西安市文史馆，陕西省、西安市参事室和文化、教育、卫生各方面人士共一百三十多人。他们在发言中都认为研究陕西的历史已是刻不容缓的事。有的谈了自己的研究心得，有的保证提供研究参考资料，还有的提出了自己要研究的题目。
