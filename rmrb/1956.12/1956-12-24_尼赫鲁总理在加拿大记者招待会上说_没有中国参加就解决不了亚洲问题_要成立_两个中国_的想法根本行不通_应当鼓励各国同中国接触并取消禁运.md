Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd dispatch from Ottawa: Indian Prime Minister Nehru said at a press conference in Ottawa on the 22nd that "Asian problems cannot be solved without China's participation." The United States will sooner or later have to recognize those "living facts" about China. He also said, "Whether China is in the United Nations or not, it can exercise its power."

The China issue was a frequently discussed topic at this press conference. Speaking to about seventy-five American, Canadian, and Indian reporters, Nehru reiterated that he believes: trying to establish "two Chinas" is "completely unworkable." He said that such a situation would not last long.

Nehru said, "In reality, the rest of the world has already recognized the existence of Communist China," and "the main country that disagrees with this view is the United States."

He suggested that "various kinds of contact" between countries around the world and China should be encouraged, and the embargo against China should be lifted.

One reporter asked, "If Communist China joins the United Nations, will it cause a shift in power?"

Nehru replied, "Power has, in fact, already shifted. Decisions concerning South Asia and East Asia cannot stand without China's participation."

Nehru also pointed out that Asian countries have undergone rapid changes in the past decade, and "the old relationship between Europe and Asia is no longer applicable." However, "some people disregard this fact and still consider issues from the perspective of old relationships."

Reporters pressed Nehru closely, asking whether he felt that his views were more "suitable" to those held by Eastern leaders or Western leaders.

He replied, "It is difficult to measure the degree of suitability, but there is one factor that plays a role, and that is the language factor." He said that it is always easier to understand the meaning more subtly when speaking face-to-face in one's own language than when relying on an interpreter.

Nehru also said that India hopes the Commonwealth connection will continue, "As far as I am concerned, I am not prepared to sever any existing connections or bridges." He stated that India is trying to promote understanding in international relations and act as "a bridge or a contact person."

A reporter asked about diplomatic relations between India and Israel. Nehru said that India is concerned about the peaceful resolution of the Middle East issue and has tried to contribute in the past. If Israel and India were to exchange ambassadors, it would adversely affect India's qualifications as a mediator between Arab countries and Israel.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd dispatch from Ottawa: Indian Prime Minister Nehru arrived in Ottawa by plane from New York on the evening of the 21st for a two-day state visit.

On the 22nd, Nehru held long, closed-door talks with Canadian government leaders. Nehru also held a press conference and attended a banquet held at "Rideau Hall," the official residence of Canadian Governor-General Massey.

    尼赫鲁总理在加拿大记者招待会上说
    没有中国参加就解决不了亚洲问题
    要成立“两个中国”的想法根本行不通
    应当鼓励各国同中国接触并取消禁运
    新华社23日讯　渥太华消息：印度总理尼赫鲁22日在渥太华举行的记者招待会上说，“没有中国参加意见，亚洲问题是解决不了的”。美国迟早会不得不承认有关中国的那些“活生生的事实”。他还说，“不论中国是不是在联合国内，它都能行使它的权力”。
    中国问题是这次记者招待会上谈论较多的一个问题。尼赫鲁在对大约七十五名美国、加拿大和印度记者谈话时重申，他认为：想要成立“两个中国”，是“根本行不通的”。他说，那种局势不会长久维持下去。
    尼赫鲁说，“实际上全世界其他国家已经承认了共产党中国存在的事实”，“不同意这种看法的，主要是美国。”
    他建议应当鼓励世界各国同中国之间的“各种各样的接触”，并且取消对中国的禁运。
    有一个记者问道：“如果共产党中国加入联合国是不是会引起权力的转移？”
    尼赫鲁回答说，“权力事实上已经转移了。只有在有中国参加的情况下，有关南亚和东亚的决定才能站得住。”
    尼赫鲁还指出：亚洲国家在过去十年内已经发生了迅速的变化，“欧亚两洲之间的旧有的关系已不再适用了。”但是，“有些人不顾这个事实而仍旧从旧关系的角度考虑问题。”
    记者们紧紧地追问尼赫鲁，他觉得自己所持有的观点究竟是同东方的领导人物们所持有的观点还是同西方领导人物们所持有的观点更加“适合”呢？
    他回答说：“要衡量适合的程度是很难的，但是有一种因素却是有作用的，那就是语言的因素。”他说，面对面地用自己的语言同人交谈，比起依靠翻译员来讲话，总是更加容易细致地体会意思的。
    尼赫鲁还说，印度希望英联邦的连系继续下去，“在我这方面，我不准备割断现有的任何一种联系或桥梁。”他表示印度正试图在国际关系中促进谅解并且作“一个桥梁或者联系人”。
    有记者问到印度和以色列的外交关系。尼赫鲁说，印度关心中东问题的和平解决，过去曾经设法出过力。如果以色列和印度互换大使，就会对印度在阿拉伯国家和以色列之间做调解人的资格发生不利影响。
    据新华社23日讯　渥太华消息：印度总理尼赫鲁21日晚乘飞机从纽约到达渥太华，作为期两天的国事访问。
    22日，尼赫鲁同加拿大政府领袖举行了长时间的秘密会谈。尼赫鲁还举行了记者招待会，并且出席了在加拿大总督麦赛将军官邸“列多厅”举行的宴会。
