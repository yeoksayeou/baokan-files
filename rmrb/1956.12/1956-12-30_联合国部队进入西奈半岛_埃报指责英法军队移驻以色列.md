Xinhua News Agency, December 29th, Cairo Dispatch: According to an announcement on the 28th by the United Nations Emergency Force Command, the United Nations Emergency Force withdrawn from the Port Said area has entered the Sinai Peninsula and is advancing behind the retreating Israeli forces.

	A battalion of Colombian troops is advancing towards Bala, and this battalion will advance along the Ismailia-Auja highway in the central Sinai Peninsula.

	A battalion of Danish and Norwegian troops has been stationed in Kubri, ten kilometers north of Suez, and will advance through the Mitla Pass in the southern Sinai Peninsula along the Suez-Eilat highway.

	A battalion of Indian troops is stationed in Snidera, twenty kilometers north of Suez, and its vanguard has reached Sudr Cape.

	Yugoslav troops were already in the Sinai Peninsula earlier and will continue to advance towards Al-Arish along the coastal highway in the northern Sinai Peninsula.

Xinhua News Agency, December 29th, Cairo Dispatch: All Cairo morning newspapers reported on the 28th that British and French troops withdrawn from Port Said are being sent to Israel after a brief stay in Cyprus.

	The "Al-Gomhuria" accused that the news of the concentration of British and French troops in Israel marked "the beginning of the second stage of the conspiracy" against Egypt.

	Egyptian newspapers said that the news of the stationing of British and French troops in Israel was confirmed by recent Israeli newspaper reports, which reported that these troops often committed crimes or caused trouble in Israeli territory.

	The "Al-Gomhuria" said that the characteristics of the new stage of the conspiracy are Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion's remarks that Israel would not allow Egypt to reoccupy the Gaza Strip, and the conspiracy of Britain, France, and Israel, with the assistance of Iraq and Turkey, against Syria.

	The newspaper pointed out that Syria had recently accused the Iraqi Prime Minister Said government of attempting to send arms from the Baghdad Pact to subversive groups in Syria.

    新华社29日讯　开罗消息：开罗所有的晨报28日都报道，撤出塞得港的英法军队在塞浦路斯稍事停留以后正在派往以色列。
    “共和国报”指责说，英法军队在以色列集中的消息标志着反对埃及的“第二阶段阴谋的开始”。
    埃及报纸说，英法军队驻在以色列的消息是由最近以色列报纸的消息证实的，这些消息报道，这些军队经常在以色列领土上犯罪或肇事。
    “共和国报”说，新阶段的阴谋的特点是以色列总理本—古里安所说的以色列不允许埃及重占加沙地带的一番话，还有英法以在伊拉克和土耳其的援助下反对叙利亚的阴谋。
    这家报纸指出，叙利亚最近曾经指责伊拉克首相赛义德政府设法把巴格达条约的军火送给叙利亚的颠覆集团。
