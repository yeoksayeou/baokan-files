Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, December 20th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice-Premier He Long, and their entourage arrived in Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, by plane this afternoon from Yangon.

Premier Zhou Enlai was first greeted by Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy. They inspected the guard of honor and together stepped onto a specially prepared platform.

Suhrawardy delivered a speech welcoming the Chinese guests.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, December 20th: Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long, after receiving warm hospitality and enthusiastic welcomes from their Burmese hosts for ten days in the Union of Burma, left here at 8:30 this morning for Pakistan.

Prime Minister U Ba Swe then delivered a farewell speech, saying:

"Respected Premier Zhou, Vice-Premier He, and all accompanying personnel:

Comrades, you have made a ten-day visit to Burma. Your visit has promoted friendship between China and Burma. During your visit, you contacted us like relatives, like brothers, like 'Pauk-Phaws'. Your efforts for Sino-Burmese friendship have been successful.

Now, as you leave us, I have no doubt that our people will deeply miss you. You have left behind in Burma a solid friendship between the two countries and peoples of China and Burma.

I hope that you will often come to visit your relative country, Burma, in the future."

Before boarding the Pakistani special plane that would take them to Karachi, the Chinese guests happily distributed the bouquets presented by eight female students from Yangon University to Mr. and Mrs. U Ba Swe, Deputy Prime Ministers Sao Khun Hkio and U Kyaw Nyein, and Daw Nu.
