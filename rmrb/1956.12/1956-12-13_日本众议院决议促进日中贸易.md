Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 12th: The Japanese House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution this evening to promote Sino-Japanese trade.

This resolution was jointly proposed by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition Socialist Party. The resolution calls for the relaxation of "embargo" restrictions on China. The resolution states that the House of Representatives hopes that Japan and China will establish non-governmental trade missions with each other, conclude agreements on direct payment and settlement between the two countries, and trade treaties to expand trade volume.

When drafting this resolution, the Socialist Party suggested including a clause calling for the early restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, because Japan had already restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union this afternoon. However, due to opposition from the Japanese Foreign Ministry and some members of the Liberal Democratic Party, this clause was not included in the draft resolution.

    日本众议院决议促进日中贸易
    新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本国会众议院今天晚间一致通过了一项关于促进日中贸易的决议。
    这项决议是由执政的自由民主党和在野的社会党联合提出的。决议要求放宽对中国的“禁运”限制。决议表示众议院希望日本同中国互相设立非政府性的贸易使团，两国缔结直接支付和清算的协定和扩大贸易量的贸易条约。
    在起草这项决议草案的时候，社会党曾经建议列入一项要求早日恢复日中邦交的条款，因为日本已经在今天下午同苏联恢复了外交关系。但是，由于日本外务省和自由民主党的一些党员反对，这项条款未能列入决议草案中。
