    Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: Beijing is launching a comprehensive rectification of grain unified purchase and supply work in December to eliminate food waste.

    An office leading this work has been established, and specialized agencies have been and are being established in various districts. A large number of cadres have been transferred and trained. Based on the spirit of "seeking truth from facts, saving enough to eat," they will rely on the broad masses to conduct a comprehensive inspection and rectification of grain for human consumption, industrial use, and feed, plug various loopholes, and verify the quantity of grain supplied.

    According to the decision of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, when conducting a comprehensive inspection of residents' rationed grain supply, the population of each household must be verified. Those who underreport missing family members or overreport numbers must be honestly reduced. For the few who genuinely lack enough grain according to the ration standard, mutual adjustment should first be organized among residents. If it is still not enough after the adjustment, the government will coordinate a solution. In government agencies, organizations, factories, mines, and enterprises, party and government leaders must personally take charge and conduct a serious inspection of the grain usage in their units, verify the population and grain requirements, and resolutely implement the grain budgeting system. The surplus grain or grain coupons at the end of each month must be turned over to the state or deducted from the next month's grain purchase. The grain used for group meals or meeting receptions must strictly adhere to the grain coupon collection system. Industrial grain usage must be controlled within the national planned targets and cannot be arbitrarily increased. Grain departments and catering industry management departments must carefully review and adjust the grain usage plans of each household based on the industry type, seasonal changes, and regional needs. All grain processing plants, grain stores, warehouses, and other units must continue to carry out the campaign to increase production and save resources, resolutely eliminate food waste, and ensure that seven million jin of grain are saved for the country in the seven months from December to June next year.

    Since Beijing implemented the proportional supply of flour in November, sales have gradually begun to decline. In the past, monthly flour sales were more than 1.4 million bags, but in November, they fell to 1.1 million bags, reversing the upward trend in grain sales that had persisted for the past few months.

    依靠广大群众消灭浪费粮食现象
    北京市开始整顿粮食统销工作
    新华社4日讯　北京市在12月份全面展开整顿粮食统销工作，消灭浪费粮食的现象。
    领导这一工作的办公室已经成立，各区也都已经和正在建立专门机构，并调配和训练了大批干部。他们将根据“实事求是，节约够吃”的精神，依靠广大群众对人食用粮、行业用粮、饲料用粮，进行一次普遍的检查和整顿，堵塞各种漏洞，核实粮食供应数量。
    根据北京市人民委员会的决定，在全面检查居民口粮供应时，要核实每户人口。对那些不缺报缺、缺少报多必须实事求是地进行核减。对于少数按定量标准确实不够吃的应该先在居民间组织相互调剂，调剂后仍不够吃，由政府调剂解决。在机关、团体、厂矿和企业中，党、政领导人要亲自负责，对本单位的用粮情况作一次认真的检查，核实人口和粮食需要量，并且坚决执行粮食预决算制度，每月月末结余的粮食或粮票要上缴国家或在下月购粮时扣除；入伙人员或会议招待用粮要严格执行收粮票制度。行业用粮必须控制在国家计划指标之内，不能任意增加。粮食部门和饮食业管理部门对各户的用粮计划，要根据行业类型、季节变化和地区需要，认真地进行审核和调整。各粮食加工厂、粮店、仓库等单位要继续开展增产节约运动，坚决消灭浪费粮食的现象，保证从12月到明年6月的七个月内，为国家节约七百万斤粮食。
    北京市从11月开始，实行面粉比例供应以来，销量已逐渐开始下降，往常每月面粉销量是一百四十多万袋，11月份下降为一百一十万袋，扭转了过去几个月来粮食销量一直上升的趋势。
