    Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture
    Overstaffed, Inefficient, and Overmanned
    Bureaucracy and Red Tape Flourish

    (Our Dispatch) According to Sichuan Daily, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture has overlapping institutions, overstaffing, and low work efficiency.

    In 1954, the Department of Agriculture had one office and eight sections, with 124 staff members. Now, the Department of Agriculture has increased to two offices, four sections, six bureaus (of which two bureaus have actually been established but not formally announced), and 403 staff members (excluding personnel from dispatched survey teams and work teams). Most bureaus have been expanded from the original sections. Each bureau is further divided into three to six sections. The number of personnel has increased several times, but the scope of business has not expanded, and the workload has increased very little. For example, at the end of last year, the Grain Crops Section had only 18 staff members; now it has been expanded into the Grain Crops Bureau (not yet formally announced), with five sections, and the number of staff members has increased to 48, but the scope of work is basically the same as before. Another example is the Economic Crops Section, which originally specialized in economic crops within the Department of Agriculture. This year, this section was expanded into the Economic Crops Bureau, with the number of personnel increasing from 17 to 38. At the same time, the Sericulture Administration Bureau was also established. Although the Sericulture Administration Bureau took over the sericulture business originally managed by the Southwest Textile Administration Bureau, the original Economic Crops Section also managed sericulture.

    With such overlapping institutions, many people have very little to do, and some are even idle. More than 50 young people who graduated from schools this year and were assigned to various bureaus and sections have had little work to do for a long time. Some people only work two hours a day, and the rest of the time they repeatedly read newspapers. Some people write letters to leaders and personnel departments requesting work assignments.

    The large and overlapping institutions naturally lead to an increase in administrative personnel. The department has a secretariat, the bureau has a secretariat section, and each section has personnel for document receiving, dispatching, safekeeping, and statistical reporting. Many people are not using what they have learned, and talents are being wasted on a large scale. For example, among the 41 staff members of the Animal Husbandry Bureau, 17 graduated from animal husbandry and veterinary departments of universities and colleges, and 21 graduated from secondary vocational schools, but only seven people are actually engaged in business and technical work.

    This has fueled the development of red tape. After the Department of Agriculture established two bureaus in July this year, the number of forms and reports sent out by the entire department increased by more than double compared to the previous month, and the number of formal official documents issued increased by more than 30% compared to the previous month.

    With the expansion of institutions and the development of red tape, the bureaucratic work style of being detached from reality is also growing. According to many agricultural departments in special districts and counties, they cannot get help from the Department of Agriculture with many practical problems encountered in their work. At the same time, the excessive number of general documents and instructions has also increased the trouble of forwarding documents, conveying information, and making arrangements downwards. For example, some of the Yin Fang japonica rice seeds introduced from other places this year carried germs. Long after the rice seeds were distributed, the Department of Agriculture notified all localities to soak the seeds with "Formalin" and asked all localities to purchase pesticides themselves. The Suining Prefectural Agricultural Section knew that they could not buy "Formalin", but they had to forward the official documents of the Department of Agriculture downwards. Because Suining County could not buy this medicine, a serious rice blast disease occurred in some of the japonica rice.

    四川省农业厅
    机构臃肿  人多事少
    人多并不好办事：滋长了文牍主义和官僚主义
    本报讯　据四川日报消息：四川省农业厅机构重叠，人浮于事，工作效率不高。
    1954年，农业厅共有一室，八科，一百二十四个工作人员。现在农业厅已增为二室，四科，六局（其中有两个局实际已成立只是没有正式宣布），四百零三个工作人员（还不包括派出的勘查队和工作队人员）。大多数局都是由原来的一个科扩大的。每一局内又分设三至六个科。人员比过去增加几倍，但业务范围并没有扩大，工作量增加也很少。例如，去年年底，粮食作物科只有十八个工作人员；现在扩大为粮食作物局（还没有正式宣布），下分设五科，工作人员增加到四十八人，工作范围基本上同过去一样。又如，农业厅内原有一个专管经济作物的经济作物科，今年这个科扩大为经济作物局，人员由十七人增至三十八人。又同时增设了蚕桑管理局。虽然蚕桑管理局接管了原由西南纺织管理局管理蚕桑业务，但是原来的经济作物科也管蚕桑。
    机构这样重叠，不少人只有很少的事情可做，有的人甚至闲着无事。今年由学校毕业被分在各局、科的五十多个青年，很多人在很长时期内都没有多少工作可做，有的人每天只做两小时的工作，其余的时间就反复阅读报纸。有的人向领导人和人事部门写信请求给自己分配工作。
    机构庞大重叠，行政人员自然随之增多。厅有秘书室，局有秘书科，各科又有文件收发保管和统计表报人员。很多人所学非所用，人材被大量闲置着。例如畜牧局的四十一个工作人员中，有十七人是大专学校畜牧兽医系科毕业的，有二十一人是中等专业学校毕业的，但真正作业务技术工作的只有七人。
    这就助长了文牍主义的发展。农业厅今年7月成立了两个局之后，全厅向外发的表报就比前一个月增加一倍以上，发出的正式公文比前月增加了30％以上。
    随着机构的膨胀、文牍主义的发展，脱离实际的官僚主义作风也在滋长。据许多专区和县的农业部门反映，他们工作中遇到的很多实际问题，得不到农业厅的帮助；同时，由于一般化的文件指示过多，还给他们增加了转发文件、传达和向下布置的麻烦。譬如，今年由外地引进的银坊粳稻种子有的带有病菌，稻种分配下去之后很久，农业厅才通知各地用“福尔马林”浸种，并要各地自行购置农药。遂宁专署农业科明明知道买不到“福尔马林”，但也不得不向下照发农业厅的公文。遂宁县因为买不到这种药，一部分粳稻发生了严重的稻热病。
