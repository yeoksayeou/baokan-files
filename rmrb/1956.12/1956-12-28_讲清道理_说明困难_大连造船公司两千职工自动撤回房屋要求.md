    Explaining the Principles, Clarifying the Difficulties
    Two Thousand Employees of Dalian Shipbuilding Company Voluntarily Withdraw Housing Requests
    (Our dispatch) After the Dalian Shipbuilding Company's Party Committee conducted education on hard work and plain living among the masses, nearly two thousand households of employees who had requested housing understood the nation's difficulties and were willing to forgo their requests.
    In recent years, the shipbuilding company has built more than 49,200 square meters of employee and family dormitories, more than doubling the housing built before 1953, solving the housing problem for more than 1,700 employee households. However, it still cannot meet the needs of the employees. Since the second half of this year, another 2,500 employee households have requested housing. To this end, the Shipbuilding Company Party Committee conducted investigations and research and found that, apart from a very small number of people who genuinely urgently needed housing, the vast majority were demanding higher living conditions due to improved living standards. This reflected that some employees did not sufficiently understand that improving living standards must be based on developing production. Therefore, they convened a conference of Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres, and held employee meetings and symposiums in various factories to widely conduct ideological education on hard work and plain living, encouraging employees to display the spirit of overcoming difficulties. After doing so, many employees who were on the fence about needing housing were willing to overcome difficulties and forgo their requests. While carrying out propaganda, they also mobilized employees who wanted housing to visit and compare with each other. Some employees saw that the living conditions of other workers were not as good as their own, and although the masses had already decided to give them additional housing, they proactively offered to transfer it to others. Wang Anxiang, a welder at the Shipbuilding Hull Factory, whose house was very dilapidated, repaired it with some wooden planks and also stated that he could temporarily forgo new housing.
    Currently, the number of employee households requesting housing has decreased from 2,500 to more than 500. The leadership of the Shipbuilding Company is currently re-examining these households requesting housing. During the re-examination, it was found that many cadres' residences were very wasteful, and preparations are being made to adjust these houses. (According to the Lüda Daily).

    讲清道理　说明困难
    大连造船公司两千职工自动撤回房屋要求
    本报讯　大连造船公司党委向群众进行艰苦朴素的教育以后，有将近两千户要求解决房子问题的职工，体谅国家困难，情愿不要了。
    这几年来，造船公司已建筑了四万九千二百多平方公尺的职工家属宿舍，比1953年以前建筑的住宅增加了两倍多，解决了一千七百多户职工的住宅问题，但是目前仍然满足不了职工的要求。今年下半年以来，又有两千五百户职工要求解决住宅问题。为此，造船公司党委作了调查研究，发现除了极小部分人确实急需房子以外，绝大部分人是由于生活改善要求较高的居住条件。这反映了有些职工对必须在发展生产的基础上提高生活水平认识不足。于是，他们召开了党、行政、工会、青年团干部大会，在各厂召开职工大会和座谈会，广泛进行艰苦朴素的思想教育，鼓励职工发挥克服困难的精神。这样做了以后，许多对住宅可要可不要的职工，都愿意克服困难而不要了。在进行宣传的同时，他们又发动要房子的职工互相访问和对比。有些职工看见别的工人居住条件还不如自己，虽然群众已经评议给自己增加房子，也主动提出转让给别人。造船船体厂电焊工人王安祥的房子破得很厉害，他要了些木板修补了一下，也表示暂时可以不要新住宅。
    现在，要房子的职工已由两千五百户减少到五百多户。造船公司领导上正在对这些要房户进行复查。在复查中，发现有许多干部的住宅浪费很大，准备对这些房屋进行调整。　（据旅大日报）。
