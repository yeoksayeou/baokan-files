Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 15th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Liang Fuqing): Currently, Guangdong Province is launching a propaganda campaign to educate farmers not to engage in purely commercial activities, helping farmers clarify the boundaries of farmer trade. A propaganda team composed of more than a hundred financial and economic cadres has begun activities in major market towns, explaining the policy of free markets under state leadership to farmers and explaining the harm of farmers abandoning agriculture for business. In rural areas, township cadres convene meetings of agricultural cooperative members to conduct propaganda. The Gaoyao Special District has transferred 120 cadres to the countryside to help district and township cadres educate farmers. Some places have also held commodity exhibitions of products allowed for farmer self-production and self-sale.

At the same time, various localities have strengthened market administrative management and adopted some economic measures. Xingning, Xinxing, Yunan, and other counties have respectively reduced the excessively large regional price differences for certain commodities and organized licensed vendors to operate commodities that they did not operate in the past but are currently needed by consumers. Agricultural cooperatives in Sihui, Yangjiang, and other counties have also made arrangements for some members who have consistently engaged in business and are currently not suitable for farming, guiding them to engage in normal farmer trade. Some agricultural cooperative members are engaged in business because of low income and difficult living conditions, and agricultural cooperatives are trying to help them increase their income. Taishan, Xinxing, and other counties have also held agricultural product exchange meetings or established farmer trade service departments to expand legitimate farmer trade.

As a result of combining propaganda and concrete measures, the phenomenon of farmers abandoning agriculture for business has been greatly reduced in many places. In Xinhui County, the number of farmers engaged in business has decreased from 1,860 to 632. All business-engaged farmers in Conghua County have returned to agricultural cooperatives for production. According to a survey of ten market towns in Deqing, Lingshan, and seven other counties, six of the market towns no longer have farmers engaged in business, and the number of farmers engaged in business in the other four market towns has also decreased by 50% to 90%.

    广东各地普遍展开宣传
    教育农民不做纯商业活动
    许多经商农民已经回乡生产
    新华社广州15日电　新华社记者梁福擎报道：目前广东省各地正展开一个教育农民不要做纯商业活动的宣传运动，帮助农民弄清农民贸易的界限。一支由财经干部组成的为数达百多人的宣传队，已开始在各个主要圩镇上活动，向农民解释国家领导下自由市场的政策，说明农民弃农从商对生产的危害。在农村由乡干部召开农业社社员大会进行宣传。高要专区抽调了一百二十名干部下乡帮助区乡干部对农民进行教育。有些地方还举行了允许农民自产自销的商品品种展览会。
    同时，各地加强了市场的行政管理和采取了一些经济措施。兴宁、新兴、郁南等县已分别缩小了某些商品过大的地区差价，并组织有牌照商贩经营他们过去没有经营而目前又为消费者所需要的商品。四会、阳江等县的农业社对一些一贯从商，目前又不宜从农的社员，也作了安排，指导他们从事正常的农民贸易。有些农业社员从商是因为收入少，生活困难，农业社正设法帮助他们增加收入。台山、新兴等县还召开了农产品交流会或成立农民贸易服务部，以扩大正当的农民贸易。
    宣传和具体措施结合进行的结果，许多地方农民弃农从商的现象已大大减少。新会县经商的农民已由一千八百六十人减到六百三十二人。从化县经商农民已全部回到农业社生产。据德庆、灵山等九个县在十个墟镇的调查，其中有六个墟镇已没有农民经商了，另四个墟镇经商农民也减少了50％到90％。
