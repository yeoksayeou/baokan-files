Xinhua News Agency, 28th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Liang reports:) The Ministry of Electric Power Industry has eight large and medium-sized hydroelectric power stations under construction. The total power generation capacity of these hydropower stations will be greater than the total electricity used by ten current cities the size of Beijing. By the end of October, the national hydropower construction had completed 75% of the annual plan.
　　
The Longxi River in Sichuan is China's first river to be developed in a cascade fashion. The first cascade hydropower station built on this river in August 1954, the Shizitan Hydropower Station, has recently had its first turbine generator unit begin generating electricity. The Shangqingyuandong second cascade hydropower station, which is being expanded, and the newly built Huilongzhai third cascade hydropower station are also under construction on this river. The construction of these hydropower stations is to provide more cheap power to the booming industry in the Chongqing area.
　　
The Shangyou Hydropower Station being built in southern Jiangxi and the hydropower station being built on the Yili River, a tributary of the Jinsha River in Yunnan, are both under intense construction. Once these two hydropower stations are completed, the rich non-ferrous metal mining in southern Jiangxi and Yunnan will be able to obtain a large supply of electricity. In addition, the Liuxi River Hydropower Station north of Guangzhou, which started construction in the third quarter of this year, is currently undergoing projects such as cofferdams and diversion tunnels.
　　
The Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station in Zhejiang, which has a power generation capacity equivalent to that of the Fengman Hydropower Station, has begun the busy construction preparation work. Tens of thousands of square meters of workers' housing and roads for construction are being built there. In order to prepare construction power for this large hydropower station, the Huangtankou Hydropower Station is being accelerated nearby.
　　
This year, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry's investment in hydropower construction has increased by 33% compared to last year. In addition to the eight large and medium-sized hydropower stations under construction, the hydropower stations that have been completed this year include Guanting in Hebei, Gutian (first phase) in Fujian, and Modekou in the suburbs of Beijing. The main reconstruction project of the first five-year plan of Fengman Hydropower Station, China's largest hydropower station, was also completed this year. The reconstructed Fengman Hydropower Station has been equipped with the latest automation technology, greatly increasing its power generation capacity.
　　
In addition to the eight large and medium-sized hydropower stations under construction mentioned above, the Sanmenxia giant hydropower station, which is being jointly built by the Ministry of Electric Power Industry and the Ministry of Water Resources, is also undergoing various preparations for construction.

　　八个大中型水电站正在加紧建设
    新华社28日讯　新华社记者王良报道：电力工业部系统有八个大中型的水力发电站正在进行建设。这些水电站的总发电能力，将比十个北京市目前所用的电力总和还要大。到10月底为止，全国水电建设已经完成年度计划的75％。
    四川龙溪河是我国第一条梯级开发的河流。1954年8月在这条河流上兴建的第一梯级水电站——狮子滩水电站，它的第一台水轮发电机组已经在最近开始发电。在这条河流上正在建设的还有扩建的上清渊硐第二梯级水电站和新建的回龙寨第三梯级水电站。这些水电站的建设，都是为了给正在蓬勃发展的重庆地区的工业提供更多廉价的动力。
    在江西南部建设的上犹水电站和在云南金沙江支流以礼河建设的水电站都正在紧张施工。这两个水电站建成以后，赣南和云南丰富的有色金属的开采就可以得到大量的电力供应。另外，今年第三季度开工的在广州以北的流溪河水电站，目前也正在进行围堰和导流隧洞等工程。
    发电能力相当于丰满水电站的浙江新安江水电站，已经开始了繁忙的施工准备工程的建设工作。那里正在建设几万平方公尺的工人住宅和施工用的公路。为了给这个大型的水电站准备施工动力，在它的附近正在加紧建设黄坛口水电站。
    今年电力工业部水力发电建设的投资比去年增长了33％。除了八个正在建设的大、中型水电站以外，在今年先后建成的水电站，还有河北的官厅、福建的古田（第一期工程）和北京市郊的模式口。我国目前最大的水电站——丰满水电站，第一个五年计划的主要改建工程项目也在今年完成了。改建后的丰满水电站，已经用自动化的最新技术装备起来，发电能力大大增加。
    除上述正在进行建设的八个大中型水电站外，由电力工业部和水利部共同建设的三门峡巨型水电站，目前也正在紧张地进行施工前的各项准备工作。
