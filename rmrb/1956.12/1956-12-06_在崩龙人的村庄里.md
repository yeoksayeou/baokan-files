　　In a Blang Village
　　By our correspondent Chen Yongjin
    For a long time, I've wanted to see the lives of our fraternal nationalities and understand the work of our Party in the areas inhabited by fraternal nationalities. During a visit to Longling County, Yunnan Province, a chance opportunity allowed me to stay in a Blang village—Naxian Village—at the foot of Gaoligong Mountain.
    Before arriving at Naxian Village, comrades in the Bawang District of Longling County told me: Dong Daxin, the accountant in Naxian Village, speaks Han Chinese well. If you find him, the translation problem will be solved. When I arrived at Naxian Village, a young man from the district supply and marketing cooperative was already there waiting for him. He asked an old man who was splitting bamboo where Dong Daxin had gone. The old man said that comrades from the county's veterinary station had come to give the pigs injections. They went out together after vaccinating the pigs in the village. The young man was about to leave when a disheveled man in his mid-thirties, with his trousers half-rolled up, came in. This was Dong Daxin. The comrade from the supply and marketing cooperative asked him what they were lacking and if the custom-made mosquito nets were suitable. Dong Daxin happily pulled me over to see the two mosquito nets in his house, the two snow-white mosquito nets swaying in the bamboo walls, with a light breeze blowing through them. Who would have known that our Blang brothers felt so close to mosquito nets? It turned out that local work comrades were afraid that the Blang people would suffer from the terrible disease of malaria again, so they specially provided mosquito net loans, and the district supply and marketing cooperative had them custom-made.
      "Look how much the Communist Party cares about us Blang people!" Dong Daxin said, his eyes gleaming with boundless excitement. He carefully looked at the two white mosquito nets hanging in his house and at the blanket on his bed, saying, "Before the Communist Party came, we Blang people dared not come here. We wouldn't have this house and the things inside it. Without the Communist Party, rice, sugarcane, and cotton wouldn't grow in our fields."
    Indeed, Dong Daxin's words expressed the significant changes in the lives of the Blang people and their gratitude to the Party. For generations, the Blang people had lived on the clouds of Gaoligong Mountain, cultivating small plots of land on that high mountain to grow corn. The grain harvested each year was only enough to eat for a month or two. They had to come down from Gaoligong Mountain to rent land from landlords at the foot of the mountain to cultivate. Every morning, they walked more than twenty li down the mountain to farm, and every evening, they ran back up to the villages on the mountaintops. Generation after generation, they ran up and down, farming for the landlords, but they were always hungry. In the past, none of the eighty-plus households in their Dazhong Village had quilts. On snowy days in the high mountains, they slept with a fire burning. In the past, the Blang people of Gaoligong Mountain would always experience a disaster every few years, causing hundreds of deaths in their village. Dong Daxin said, "Since I can remember, the Blang people of Dazhong Village have experienced six major disasters. The worst one killed more than 190 people. In 1943, my mother and sister died of a malignant disease. In 1944, my brother died. In 1948, my wife and a child died. After the Communist Party came, I remarried and had children." As he spoke, Dong Daxin gently held his little daughter in his arms.
    A woman wearing a black-striped red tube skirt, doing needlework, also leaned in and said:
      "If the Communist Party had come two years earlier, my mother wouldn't have died!" She lowered her head, as if recalling infinitely tragic past events. Before anyone else could speak, she said again:
  "Comrade, the year before last, our small village had 'miasma' again, and seventeen people died. When the government heard that there was 'miasma,' they sent people to treat the disease. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to meet you."
    The changes in this small Naxian Village have only happened in the last two years. In 1953, news of land reform spread here! The local landlords ran to Dazhong Village on Gaoligong Mountain and said that they were willing to let the Blang people cultivate the land without rent. More than forty households of Blang people moved from the high mountains. The second year after they came, disease closely followed them, and seventeen people died in more than forty households. When the government heard that there was a malignant infectious disease here, they sent people to rescue them day and night, which stopped it. The Blang people, who were afraid of disease, moved back to Dazhong Village on the mountaintop, leaving only ten households behind. Last year, land reform was implemented, and these Blang people, who had never had paddy fields before, were given paddy fields. Then, a cooperative was established in their village, and the local district committee personally sent people to help them with production, asking them to go to farms to learn how to select seeds. That's how they achieved a bumper harvest. This year, they planted double-cropping rice and large areas of cotton. It can be said that this is the first time the Blang people here have grown cotton. They are starting to fertilize. The corn fertilized on that fertile black soil is taller than the sorghum in the north. They never know drought here because there is running water everywhere in the mountains. They will not be flooded either because they are at the foot of Gaoligong Mountain. Now, in this small Naxian Village, the herds of pigs, chickens, and cattle make it even more prosperous.
    The Blang people of Naxian Village clearly know that the reason why they often suffer from epidemics and die is poverty and a lack of hygiene. Now, the houses in every family are swept clean, and now ten families have nineteen mosquito nets. They are learning culture, and Dong Daxin is an active learner. Whether he is resting in the fields or going somewhere else, as long as he sees a cadre or someone who can read, he will ask if he doesn't recognize a word. Now, he can write the names of the people in Naxian Village. In Naxian Village, many young men and women have bought fountain pens and notebooks, and they teach each other during breaks.
    That evening, I stayed in this emerging village of fraternal nationalities. After dinner, people went to Dong Daxin's place to record work points, and some girls came to chat. Dong Daxin took out a hulusi and started playing it, and another girl accompanied him with a mouth harp. The sound of this instrument is particularly elegant. Dong Daxin played a section and said, "When we Blang people court girls, we use this hulusi. We play it outside the house, and the girl comes out. The girls know the sound of the hulusi of the boy she likes the most. I'm old," Dong Daxin said, his eyes twinkling with joy, looking at the girl in the lamplight, "Look, many young men come to court Li Xiao'an [Note 1]."
    Li Xiao'an, a seventeen-year-old girl, covered her face with her hands in the lamplight.
    As he spoke, Dong Daxin sang the popular courting tune in their village:
    In the past, I was a poor man,
    My family was so poor that we had nothing,
    We didn't even have parents;
    I wanted to give you roe deer [Note 2] to eat, but I didn't have money to buy it.
    I want to sing it again,
    Now that we have the Communist Party, we have fields and cattle,
    You will love me.
    The young men and women in the house laughed as they listened to Dong Daxin sing. After Dong Daxin finished singing, he picked up the hulusi and started playing it again. The beautiful sound of the sheng and the joyful singing lasted until late at night.
      [Note 1] Courting a girl means choosing a lover. A young girl can be courted by many young men, and the girl makes the final decision.
    [Note 2] Roe deer is something women chew to dye their teeth.

### 在崩龙人的村庄里

　　在崩龙人的村庄里
　　本报记者　陈勇进
    很久以来就想看看兄弟民族的生活，了解了解我们的党在兄弟民族地区的工作。在云南龙陵县访问的时候，一个偶然的机会使我住在高黎贡山下的崩龙人的村庄里——那线村。
    未到那线村时，龙陵县霸王区里的同志告诉我：那线村里说汉话说得好的是会计董大新，找到他，翻译问题就好办。我到那线村时，区供销社的一个青年也在那里等着他。他问一个正在破竹子的老头，董大新到哪里去了。那老头说县里派来了兽医站的同志给猪打针，他们给这村上的猪打了针就一块出去了。那青年正想走，一个头发蓬松的三十五六岁的人，半挽着裤子进来了，这就是董大新。那个供销社的同志把他们缺少什么东西问了一遍就问他们订做的蚊帐合适不合适。董大新高兴地拉着我看他家的两架蚊帐，那两架雪白的蚊帐在轻风吹透的竹墙里摆动着。谁能晓得崩龙人兄弟对蚊帐感到这么亲切呢？原来这是当地的工作同志怕崩龙人民再得可怕的疟疾病，特地贷的蚊帐款由区供销社定做的。
      “你看共产党对我们崩龙人多么关心！”董大新说着眼里闪着无限的激动，又仔细地看看他屋子里挂着的两个白蚊帐，看看他床上的毯子说：“共产党不来我们崩龙人不敢到这里来，这屋子和屋里面的东西都不会有，没有共产党这稻子甘蔗棉花不会在我们的田地里长。”
    确实，董大新这几句话表达了崩龙人民生活的重大变革和对党的感谢。世世代代崩龙人都住在高黎贡山的云层上面，在那高大的高黎贡山上开点土地种点玉米。每年收获的粮食仅够一两个月吃的。他们不得不从高黎贡山上走下来租山下地主的土地种。每天早上走二十多里下山来种田，每到傍晚再跑上山顶顶的村庄上去。世世代代都这样跑下跑上地给地主种田，但他们世世代代都饿着肚皮。他们大中寨的八十多户人家在过去没有一家有被子，在高山飘雪的日子都是燃着火睡觉。在以往这高黎贡山的崩龙人，隔不了几年总会有一场灾难，使他们这个村庄上成百人的死亡。董大新说：“我记事以来，大中寨的崩龙人有六次大灾难，最多的一次死了一百九十多个，1943年我母亲和妹妹得恶性病死了，1944年我的兄弟死了，1948年我的老婆和一个孩子死了；共产党来后我又成了家，有了孩子。”董大新说着轻轻地把他的小姑娘搂在怀里。
    一个穿黑条红筒裙的妇女，她做着针线活，也凑近来说：
      “共产党早来两年我母亲就死不了啦！”她低下头来像回忆无限悲惨的往事，没等别人开口她又说：
  “同志，前年我们这个小村上又有了‘瘴气’死了十七口人。政府听说有了‘瘴气’就派人来治病，要不然，咱们也见不上面了。”
    这个小小的那线村的变化，是最近两年的事。1953年这里传来了土地改革的风声！当地的地主们就跑到高黎贡山上的大中寨说：他们愿意把土地让给崩龙人种不要租子。大中寨的崩龙人从高山上迁来四十多户。他们来后的第二年，疾病紧紧追赶着他们来了，四十多户人家死了十七口人。政府听说这里有了恶性传染病，星夜派人来急救，才算停止了。怕疾病的崩龙人又搬回山顶上的大中寨，就留下现在十户人。去年土地改革了，这些从来就没有水田的崩龙人得到了水田，接着他们寨子上又成立了合作社，当地的区委会亲自派人帮助他们生产，叫他们到农场里学习选种。就这样他们才得到了丰收。今年，他们又种了双季稻，又种了大片片的棉花，可以说这里的崩龙人是第一次种棉花；他们开始在施肥。那肥沃的黑土上施肥的玉米，比北方的高粱还高。他们这里永远不知道旱，因为到处有山间的流水；他们也不会被淹，因为他们在高黎贡山的山脚下，现在在这个小小的那线村里，那猪群、鸡群、牛群使它显得更加丰裕。
    那线村的崩龙人，清楚地知道他们过去所以经常得流行病而死亡的原因，就是穷困和不讲究卫生。现在每家的房子里都打扫得干干净净，现在十家人有十九个蚊帐。他们正学习文化，董大新就是积极学习的一个。不管在田间休息的时候，也不管到别的地方去，见了干部或者认字的人，只要他有不认得的字就会发问；现在他们那线村的人名字，他都能写得来。在那线村不少男女青年们都买了水笔和本本，在休息的时候就互相教学。
    这天晚上，我住在这个新兴的兄弟民族的村庄上。人们在吃过晚饭后到董大新那里记工分，其中也有姑娘们凑来闲谈。董大新拿出葫芦笙吹起来，另外一个姑娘用口弦和着。这种乐器的声音听来特别幽雅。董大新吹了一段说：“我们崩龙人串姑娘时，就用这葫芦笙，在屋外一吹，姑娘就出来了，姑娘们知道她最喜欢的小伙子的葫芦的声音。我这老了”，董大新闪烁着快乐的眼睛，看着那灯影影里的姑娘说：“你看，那个李小安就有好多小伙子来串〔注一〕她。”
    李小安，一个才十七岁的姑娘在灯影里用手遮着面孔。
    董大新说着唱了他们村庄上流行的串姑娘的调子：
    过去我是个穷人家，
    家里穷得一样也没有，
    就是连父母也没有；
    我想送给你鹿子〔注二〕吃也没有钱买。
    我要再唱一遍，
    如今有了共产党有的田和牛，
    你就会把我爱。
    屋子里的青年男女们听着董大新唱，也咯咯笑起来。董大新唱完又捧着葫芦笙吹起来，这优美的笙声和快乐的歌声直到深夜。
      〔注一〕串姑娘是选择恋爱对象的意思，一个年青姑娘可以有很多的小伙子串，最后由姑娘决定。
    〔注二〕鹿子是妇女嚼的一种东西，用来染牙齿。
