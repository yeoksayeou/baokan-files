    Solve the Problem of Pig Feed, Increase Commune Members' Interest in Pig Raising
    Jian Hong
    Shandong Province's pig raising industry has seen significant development compared to before the cooperative high tide last year. Even the Lu northwest region, which historically raised the fewest pigs, now has more pigs. Before October of last year, the province raised less than three million pigs, which increased to nearly four million this spring; according to statistics in September, it had already reached four million nine hundred thousand pigs.
    How were such great achievements obtained? One reason is: the promotion of using coarse feed (fermented sweet potato leaves, tree leaves, bean leaves, peanut skins, etc.) to replace fine feed (lees, bran, etc.). Another reason is: the conscientious implementation of the policy of "collective breeding, private raising, public assistance for private raising," which encouraged the enthusiasm of commune members to raise pigs. These experiences are clearly seen in the development of pig production in the Xuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yidu County.
    The Xuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yidu County has a total of 483 households, and the number of privately and collectively raised pigs has more than doubled compared to last year. In the past, raising pigs here required a lot of grain, with an average of two to two and a half jin of grain fed to each pig per day from small to large. Therefore, before liberation, only a very small number of landlords and rich peasants raised pigs, and the vast majority of peasants could not afford to raise pigs. After the land reform, a small number of farmers raised pigs, but the original landlords and rich peasants no longer raised them. The Fu Jia Zhuang production team of this cooperative, with a total of more than 70 households, had only 20-odd households raising 30-odd pigs before liberation; after the land reform, until before the advanced stage of cooperativization, the entire village only had 30-odd pigs.
    This spring, the leading organs called for using coarse feed instead of fine feed to raise pigs, and the collectively raised pigs greatly developed. Last year, the primary cooperative did not have collectively raised pigs, but this year, the cooperative raised 176 pigs, which only ate lees and bran and a small amount of sesame cake and grain for three months, with most of their diet consisting of wild vegetables and fermented sweet potato leaves.
    Privately raised pigs by commune members have also developed, with nearly 300 pigs raised last year, increasing to 459 this year. The development of private pig raising is mainly due to the concrete implementation of the policy of collective breeding, private raising, and public assistance for private raising. Over the past year, this cooperative has provided great assistance to commune members in raising pigs. Because the cost of raising sows is too high (one sow can eat the feed of four fattened pigs), most commune members cannot afford to raise them. The cooperative first raised a large number of sows (the cooperative raised 31, while the commune members only raised 11). Some commune members did not have money to buy piglets, so the cooperative first advanced them money to feed them, and they would pay the cooperative back after selling the pigs or fertilizer. If households raising sows had piglets that they could not sell, the cooperative would take care of them and pay them on the spot. Farmers who did not have money to buy piglets and did not have feed to feed pigs could feed the publicly owned pigs for the cooperative (the cooperative could not build a large number of pigsties all at once, so a large part of the pigs were publicly owned and privately raised). There were work points and certain rewards for feeding pigs for the cooperative. Feeding small pigs weighing 20 to 50 jin earned 0.04 work points per pig per day; the work points increased as the pigs grew larger. Over-production beyond 160 jin was subject to a 30/70 profit split at market prices (commune members get 70%, the cooperative gets 30%). Each household could feed four to eight pigs, and each pig could earn 16 labor days after being raised. Feeding a sow for the cooperative earned 0.1 work points per day; a reward of 20 work points was given for a litter of piglets exceeding 14, and 0.02 work points were deducted for each death. Two litters can be produced in a year, earning two rewards, for a total of 40 labor days including the daily work points. There were also certain subsidies for borrowing pigsties from commune members. Therefore, commune members are willing to raise pigs for the cooperative, and the cooperative regards pig raising as a form of care for households in difficulty. These supports are not the main thing. The biggest factor in increasing commune members' enthusiasm for pig raising is the reasonable regulation of fertilizer prices. According to calculations, the cost of raising a pig is about the same as, or even equal to, the price of selling the pig after it is fattened. A pig from small to 150 or 160 pounds to eat, at least 1000 kg of bran or 2000 kg of lees. One pound of bran is 2.2 cents and one pound of dregs is 1 cent, costing 20 yuan, or even more. In addition, it also needs 200-300 pounds of grain or sesame cake, costing 18-19 or 20 yuan with grain at eight cents per pound. In addition, it also takes a lot of work to pad the bars, dig wild vegetables. When they grow up, they sell for only 40 yuan, and do not make any money. The main profit is fertilizer. The original manure price stipulated by this cooperative was: 0.18 to 0.22 yuan per load (100 jin), divided into three grades: sow fertilizer, fattening pig fertilizer, and "Kela" fertilizer. Many commune members did not buy piglets because the fertilizer price was too low. After discovering the problem, the cooperative management committee calculated it in time and raised the fertilizer price to 0.26 to 0.32 yuan per load. After this adjustment, commune members can get 30-40 yuan of fertilizer income after raising a pig. This income solves a small but not insignificant problem in the lives of commune members - some households use fertilizer income to solve the problem of pocket money for the whole year, and some use fertilizer income to supplement clothing, quilts, or make production investments. Therefore, at present, commune members are competing to raise pigs.
    Due to the increase in fertilizer, the cooperative's output this year increased by 40% compared to last year. In the past, only soybean cake and chemical fertilizers were used to grow yellow tobacco. This year, the supply of fine fertilizer was very small, and the main fertilizer used was pig manure, and the harvest was about the same as in the past.
    Raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer benefits both the collective and the individual. This cooperative plans to double the number of pigs raised next year, requiring each household to raise three pigs. All 42 sows in the cooperative will produce two litters a year, with a minimum of 800 piglets. At the end of the year, a portion of fattening pigs will be sold, and a portion of semi-grown pigs will be retained, for a total of 1,200 pigs. Next year, it is also planned to retain 15 more sows, and there will be greater development in 1958. The feed problem is not significant either. The entire cooperative planted 22 times more sweet potatoes this year than last year.

    解决养猪饲料问题，提高社员养猪兴趣
    剑虹
    山东省的养猪业，比去年合作化高潮以前有了显著的发展。一向养猪最少的鲁西北地区，现在养的猪也多了。去年10月以前，全省养猪不到三百万头，今春发展到近四百万头；据9月间统计，已经达到四百九十万头。
    这样大的成绩是怎样得来的呢？一个原因是：推广了以粗饲料（发酵的地瓜叶、树叶、豆叶、花生皮等）代替精饲料（糟、糠等）的办法。另一个原因是：认真地贯彻执行了“社繁自养，私养公助”的方针，鼓舞了社员养猪的积极性。这些经验，从益都县旭光农业生产合作社生猪发展的情况中，看得很明显。
    山东益都县旭光农业生产合作社共有四百八十三户，现在私养和公养的猪，比去年增加了一倍还多。这里过去养猪喂粮食很多，一头猪从小到大平均每天喂二斤至二斤半粮食。因此，解放前只有极少数地主、富农养猪，绝大部分农民养不起猪。土地改革以后，少数农户养了猪，但原来的地主、富农不养了。这个社的傅家庄生产队共七十多户，解放前只有二十几户养三十来头猪；土地改革以后，直到高级化以前，全庄也只有三十来头猪。
    今年春天领导机关号召用粗饲料代精饲料喂猪，公养的猪大大发展。去年初级社没有公养猪，今年，社里养了一百七十六头，这些猪仅吃三个月的糟糠和少量的麻饼、粮食，大部分是吃的野菜和发酵的甘薯叶。
    社员私养的猪也有发展，去年养猪近三百头，今年发展到了四百五十九头。私养猪的发展，主要是因为具体地执行了社繁自养和私养公助的方针。一年来，这个合作社对社员养猪进行了很大的帮助。因为养母猪成本太贵（一头母猪可吃四个肥猪的饲料），大多数社员养不起，社里首先养了大量的母猪（社养三十一头、社员仅养十一头），有些社员没有钱买小猪，社里就先支给他去喂，待卖了猪或肥料以后给钱。养母猪的户，如果有小猪卖不出去，社里包干，当时付钱。没有钱买小猪、又没有饲料喂猪的农户，可给社里喂公有的猪（社里一下盖不起大量的猪栏，很大一部分猪是公有私养的）。给社里喂猪有工分，也有一定的奖励。喂二十到五十斤的小猪，每头每天四厘工；猪大工分递增。超过一百六十斤的超产量，按市价三七分红（社员得七成，社里得三成）。每户可喂四头到八头，每头养成后可得十六个劳动日。给社里喂一头母猪，一天一分工；下一窝小猪满十四头奖二十分工，死一头扣二分。一年可下两窝，得两次奖，连平日的工分，共可得四十个劳动日。借用社员的猪栏也有一定的补贴。因此，社员都愿给合作社养猪，社里把喂猪的事当成了对困难户的照顾。这些扶助还不是主要的。提高社员养猪积极性的最大因素，是对肥料价格的合理规定。据计算：养一头猪的成本，和喂成后卖猪的价钱差不多，甚至相等。一头猪从小喂到一百五、六十斤，最少要吃一千斤糠或二千斤糟。一斤糠二分二，一斤糟一分，需二十元，甚至还多一点。另外还需要二百至三百斤的粮食或麻饼，每斤粮食八分，也需十八、九至二十多元。此外，还要搭出不少工夫垫栏、挖野菜。喂大后，也不过卖四十来元，不赚什么钱，主要的赚头是肥料。这个合作社原来规定的粪价是：每挑（一百斤）一角八分至二角二分，分母猪肥、肥猪肥、克拉肥三等。许多社员因为肥价偏低都不买小猪了，社管理委员会发现问题及时计算后，把肥价提高到每挑二角六分到三角二分。这样调整以后，社员养成一头猪，就可以得到三十多元到四十元的肥料收入。这笔收入，解决了社员生活中的不小的问题——有些户靠肥料收入解决了全年的零花钱问题，有的用肥料收入补充衣、被，或者做生产投资。因此，目前社员都争着养猪。
    由于肥料增加，合作社今年比去年增产40％。过去种黄烟完全施的豆饼和化学肥料，今年细肥供应很少，施的主要是猪肥，收成和过去差不多。
    养猪积肥，公私两利。这个合作社计划明年把养猪数目再增加一倍，要求每户养三头猪。全社四十二头母猪，一年下两窝，最少可下八百多头；年底卖一部分肥猪，还可以留一部分半大猪，共可达一千二百来头。明年还计划再留十五头母猪，到1958年还会有更大的发展。饲料问题也不大，光甘薯全社今年比去年就多种了二十二倍。
