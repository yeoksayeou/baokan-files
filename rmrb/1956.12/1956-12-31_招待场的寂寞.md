    The Loneliness of the Invitation-Only Performance
    Feng Zi
    I often see the rehearsals and performances of new plays, and I often encounter actors, directors, and people working in the theater; therefore, I often hear opinions that are almost like complaints.
    One actor said: I'm really afraid of performing at invitation-only events. From the opening to the end, I don't get even a tiny bit of "exchange."
    Another actor said: A play is painstakingly rehearsed and performed dozens of times, but we never hear a single word of criticism, let alone encouragement or comfort! I've been working in theater for twenty years, and I've never felt as lonely as I do today!
    After a new play is performed, are there no opinions or criticisms? There are. I have personally heard some people relaying the opinions and criticisms of others. For example:
    "I heard so-and-so say: Don't bother watching that play, it's boring and long, you'll be miserable."
    "I heard so-and-so say, is that what comedy is supposed to be like? The audience didn't laugh, but the actors were laughing on stage. What kind of acting is that?"
    "Someone told me that drama is going backwards, cheaply making the audience cry and laugh to achieve an effect."
    The above opinions, of course, come from the audience at invitation-only performances.
    Some say that being invited to a performance for the literary and art circles, even in the hottest summer, feels like being below freezing; one can imagine how cold the air is in the theater! This cold air attacks from the audience to the stage, even to backstage... No wonder loneliness and indifference are the most heartfelt feelings for those working in the theater today.
    Whether this is the case is yet to be seen. However, I want to speak up for the audience members who attend invitation-only performances. Those who attend invitation-only performances are not directly involved in the production of the play, but they must have some connection to it. Precisely because of this, they are naturally different from audience members who buy tickets. The difference is that audience members who pay for tickets are there to enjoy themselves, so they appreciate the performance with their hearts; audience members who are invited to the performance see it as a task, so they have to analyze it with their brains. They can't laugh when they should laugh. If someone accidentally laughs, their mind will quickly flash through the thought, "Why am I laughing?" This thought keeps them from laughing. Although there is no set way to offer opinions, it cannot be said that people who attend invitation-only performances are not responsible. Moreover, isn't discussing it behind the scenes also a way of expressing opinions?
    Nevertheless, behind-the-scenes discussions do not dispel the feeling of loneliness and indifference. Precisely because it is behind the scenes, it is like an echo in an empty valley, making people feel even more isolated.
    If this feeling is universal and normal, it shows that the current situation of drama is special and abnormal. Why is it that in today's era of letting a hundred flowers bloom, only the flower of drama does not receive the care and support it deserves? Compared to its sister arts of film and opera, why does it receive so little care and attention? No wonder some writers who have written plays have said: If it were possible to become a professional writer again, then my first choice would be to write novels, my second choice would be to write film scripts, and my third... (it should be noted that this is no longer a choice) write plays!
    There are many reasons why playwrights are unwilling to write plays, but one of the reasons is probably related to the cold air in the theater circle. And there must be many reasons for the formation of this cold air, but one of the reasons is probably inseparable from the lack of attention from the leadership in charge of the theater industry?
    Of course, hard work is not without results. The word "full" that is often seen in the drama advertisements in the newspaper advertisement column is a kind of explanation, isn't it? However, people who love the art of drama will never be satisfied with this "full" word. The return of spring is not far away, and the cold air in the theater industry should be dispelled!

    招待场的寂寞
    凤子
    经常看到一些新的话剧的排演和演出，也经常碰到一些演员、导演和在话剧工作岗位上的人；因此也就经常听到一些近乎是牢骚的意见。
    一个演员说：我真怕演招待场，从开幕到散场，得不到一星一点的“交流”。
    另一个演员说：一个戏辛辛苦苦地排了，辛辛苦苦演了几十场，结果听不到一句近乎批评的话，更别说鼓励和安慰了！干了二十年的话剧，从来没有像今天这么感到寂寞！
    一个新戏演出后是不是就没有意见和批评呢？有的。我就亲耳听到一些人转述的另一些人的意见和批评。例如：
    “我听到××说：××戏可别去看了，又臭又长，准受不了。”
    “我听到××说，喜剧是这样的么？观众没有笑，演员却在台上笑了，这是什么表演方法？”
    “谁告诉过我，话剧在开倒车了，为了追求效果，廉价地逗观众哭，逗观众笑。”
    以上这些意见，当然是来自招待场的观众。
    有人说招待文艺界，那怕是大伏天，也像是在严寒的零度之下；人们可以想像场内空气之冷！这一股冷空气从台下袭击到台上，甚至袭击到台后……难怪寂寞和冷淡是目前在剧院工作的人最切身的感受。
    事实是否如此，待考。不过，我却要为看招待场的观众说说话。看招待场的人不是直接搞戏的，也必然是同戏有些瓜葛。唯其如此，自然不同于买票看戏的观众。不同之点在于，花钱的观众为了享受，因此是用心来欣赏；被招待的观众看戏是一种任务，因此就不得不用脑来分析，该笑的时候便笑不起来，如果有人不慎笑了，脑子里就要闪电般地转念一下“为什么笑？”这一转念不打紧，自己可就笑不起来了。尽管没有一定的方式来提意见，却不能说看招待场的人们不负责任。何况背后的议论不也是发表意见的方式之一么？
    尽管如此，背后的议论并不能驱散寂寞和冷淡的感觉，唯其是在背后，就如同空谷回声一般令人加倍地感到冷寂。
    如果这种感觉是普遍的、正常的，说明了今天话剧所处的境地是特殊的、不正常的。为什么在百花齐放的今天，惟独话剧这一朵花得不到应有的热情的照顾和扶植呢？比起电影、戏曲这两个姊妹艺术来是那样的得不到关怀和重视呢？难怪有一些曾经写过话剧的作家就这么说过：如果有可能重新作职业作家，那么第一志愿是写小说，第二志愿是写电影剧本，第三……（应说明已非志愿了）写话剧！
    剧作家不愿写话剧原因甚多，但原因之一恐怕与话剧圈的冷空气有关，而冷空气的形成原因也必然甚多，但原因之一恐怕是与话剧事业有关领导方面重视不足分不开吧？
    当然，辛勤的劳动也不是毫无取得的，报纸广告栏话剧广告经常刊着的一个满字，不就是一种说明么？不过，热爱话剧艺术的人绝不会满足于这个“满”字的。大地春回为期应不远，话剧事业中的冷空气该到了被驱散的时候了！
