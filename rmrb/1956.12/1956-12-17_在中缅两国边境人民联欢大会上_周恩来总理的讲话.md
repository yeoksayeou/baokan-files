Premier of the Union of Burma U Ba Swe, Deputy Prime Ministers U Kyaw Nyein, U Zaw Khun Tin and other distinguished guests from Burma, friends, Governor Liu and brothers of all nationalities of Yunnan Province, comrades:

    While I am paying a friendly visit to our neighbor Burma, I am very honored and pleased to be able to invite Prime Minister U Ba Swe and other Burmese guests to join us across the border to attend the border people's meeting held in Mangshi, and to receive them here as hosts. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I would like to extend a warm welcome to Prime Minister U Ba Swe, other leaders of the Burmese government, leaders of various ethnic groups from Kachin State and Shan State who are present today, and other Burmese friends.

    Brothers of all nationalities in Yunnan Province: Although I have been to Yunnan Province several times, this is my first time visiting the autonomous prefecture where your province's border ethnic brothers live. Your rich and beautiful land, your labor and creation, especially the achievements in various aspects since liberation, deeply attract us and make us feel very gratified. In recent years, you have made many valuable contributions to the peaceful construction of the motherland and the promotion of Sino-Burmese friendship. I would like to congratulate you on behalf of the government and extend my brotherly greetings to you.

    Brothers and comrades: Holding such a border people's friendship gathering to establish broader and closer direct contact between the border people of China and Myanmar is of great significance for promoting the friendship and unity between the people of China and Myanmar. In January of this year, the Burmese government held a border people's friendship gathering in Laiki Town, near Longchuan County in our country, which played a good role in enhancing understanding and friendship between the border people of the two countries and set a good start for us. I hope that this border people's meeting in Mangshi, with the personal participation of leaders from the two governments, will promote more exchanges and further understanding and friendship between our two peoples.

    China and Myanmar are close neighbors. More than 2,000 kilometers of border tightly connect our two countries. The people of the two countries have a traditional friendship of more than a thousand years, as close as relatives. In the past hundred years, due to the invasion of colonialists, the traditional ties between the people of our two countries have been artificially hindered. The colonialists also created divisions and discord between the Chinese and Burmese people in order to maintain colonial rule. However, after the long and heroic struggles carried out by the people of our two countries, we finally achieved the national independence and freedom of our two countries, and in accordance with the wishes of the people of the two countries, we have developed and strengthened the friendship between our two countries on the new basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In the past few years, leaders of our two countries have continuously exchanged visits, and economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries have been increasing day by day. The development of friendly relations between our two countries not only brings many benefits to the construction and happiness of the people of the two countries, but also makes valuable contributions to the unity of Asian and African countries, world peace, and international understanding and cooperation.

    Of course, in the process of developing friendly relations between our two countries along the path of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, it is not impossible for us to encounter certain obstacles. The time for our two countries to establish new countries and restore diplomatic relations is not long, and some historical issues related to the relations between the two countries have not had the opportunity to be resolved. In this case, it is understandable that some people on both sides hold reservations and doubts about individual issues. However, I believe that as long as the governments and people of our two countries firmly adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and treat each other with sincerity, our mutual understanding and trust will increase day by day, and all issues between us can be gradually resolved fairly and reasonably. As everyone knows, the Chinese and Burmese governments recently held friendly talks on the outstanding border issues between the two countries in the spirit of sincerity and mutual understanding. Through this meeting, our mutual understanding has been further enhanced. We can expect that this historically left over issue involving a wide range of issues will be resolved fairly and reasonably with the unanimous agreement of the people of the two countries.

    In recent years, due to the harassment of the Kuomintang remnant armed forces among the people in the border areas of our two countries, and also because there are still areas where our two countries do not understand each other enough, the traditional ties between the border people of the two countries living in this area, such as small-scale trade and mutual visits, have inevitably been hindered and affected. This situation can be gradually improved. As far as we in China are concerned, we have always hoped to strengthen Sino-Burmese friendship and the ties between the people of the two countries, but we have not paid enough attention to the specific measures to improve the ties between the border people of the two countries, and there are still cases of excessive restrictions and inconveniences in some matters. We are prepared to correct these shortcomings in future work, and work together with the Burmese government and people to do a better job of Sino-Burmese friendship and the friendly cooperation of the Sino-Burmese border people, in line with the wishes of the people of the two countries.

    Friends and comrades, what makes us particularly happy is that the same brotherly ethnic groups live on the borders of our two countries, and many representatives of such brotherly ethnic groups are present today. You have the same blood, language and customs, and drink water from the same river. Your long-standing and sincere traditional relationship is of special and great significance for the development of friendship between China and Myanmar. We should cherish this precious friendship very much and further develop the friendly and cooperative relations between the border people of the two countries. In order to achieve this, I believe that the border people of our country should make greater efforts than the border people of Myanmar. Since China is a country with a large population, we should take more proactive measures to prove with our own practical actions that we have always adhered to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. For the people of our friendly neighbor, we must always be humble, prudent and patient, and resolutely oppose great-power chauvinism. As long as we hold this attitude, the friendship between the border people of our two countries and the friendship between the people of the two countries will continue to be consolidated and continue to increase. In this way, the border areas of the two countries will be more easily developed and prospered, and the border people of the two countries can live a happier and more enjoyable life.

    The holding of this conference marks a higher development of the friendly unity of the border people of China and Myanmar. I hope that in the future, the border people of the two countries will have more frequent meetings and more frequent exchanges, so that the kinship-like friendship between the people of our two countries will become more intimate and richer.

    Once again, I thank Prime Minister U Ba Swe and other leaders and distinguished guests of the Burmese government for traveling thousands of miles to attend our border people's meeting, and thank the friends of all ethnic groups from the Burmese border. Your presence fills our meeting with the harmonious and festive atmosphere of family reunions. We are very sorry that we have not been able to entertain you well. Please forgive us as you would forgive your brothers. I hope you will bring back to Myanmar the deep friendship and cordial greetings of the Chinese people to the Burmese people. I wish you health and happiness.

    Long live the friendship between the people of all ethnic groups on the Sino-Burmese border!

    Long live the friendship between the people of China and Myanmar!

    Long live the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence!

    Long live world peace!

    I wish President Ba U of the Union of Burma good health and longevity! (Xinhua News Agency, Mangshi, 16th)

    在中缅两国边境人民联欢大会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    缅甸联邦总理吴巴瑞阁下，副总理藻昆卓阁下、吴觉迎阁下和其他来自缅甸的贵宾们，朋友们，刘代省长和云南省各民族的兄弟们，同志们：
    当我正在我们的邻邦缅甸进行友好访问的期间，我能邀请吴巴瑞总理阁下和其他缅甸贵宾们，同我们一起跨越边境前来参加在芒市举行的边民大会，并且在这里以主人的身份接待他们，使我感到十分荣幸和愉快。我谨以中国政府和人民的名义，向吴巴瑞总理、缅甸政府其他领导人，今天到会的克钦邦、掸邦的各族领导人以及其他缅甸朋友们表示热烈的欢迎。
    云南省各民族的弟兄们：我虽然几次到过云南省，但是来你们省的边疆兄弟民族的聚居的自治州，这还是第一次。你们的富饶美丽的土地，你们的劳动创造，特别是解放以来在各方面的成就，深深地吸引我们，使我们感到十分欣慰。你们近年来对祖国的和平建设和增进中缅友好的工作作了许多可贵的贡献，我愿代表政府祝贺你们，并且向你们致以兄弟般的问候。
    弟兄们，同志们：举行这样的边民联欢大会，让中缅两国边民之间建立更广泛和密切的直接接触，对于促进中缅两国人民的友好、团结是具有重大的意义的。今年1月，缅甸政府曾经在邻近我国陇川县的雷基镇召开了边民联欢大会，对增进两国边民之间的了解和友谊起了很好的作用，替我们作了一个良好的开端。我希望这次在芒市举行的、由两国政府领导人员亲自参加的边民大会，将能促进我们两国人民之间更多的来往和更进一步的了解和友谊。
    中国和缅甸是亲密的邻邦。两千多公里的边界把我们两国紧紧地连结在一起。两国人民之间有着一千多年的传统友谊，好像亲人一般的密切。近一百年来，由于殖民主义者的侵入，我们两国人民的传统联系遭到了人为的阻挠。殖民主义者并且曾经在中缅人民间制造隔阂和不和，以便维持殖民主义的统治。但是经过我们两国人民各自进行的长期英勇斗争，我们终于取得了我们两国的民族独立和自由，并且根据两国人民的愿望，在和平共处的五项原则的新的基础上，发展和加强了我们两国的友谊。几年来，我们两国领导人员间不断进行了互相访问，两国间的经济、文化往来也日益加强。我们两国的友好关系的发展，不仅为两国的建设和人民幸福带来许多好处，而且对于亚非各国的团结、世界和平和国际间的谅解和合作也作出了有价值的贡献。
    当然，在我们沿着和平共处的五项原则的道路发展两国友好关系的过程中，我们不是不可能遇到某些阻碍的。我们两国各自建立新国家并且恢复外交关系的时间还不很久，某些历史遗留下来有关两国关系的问题还没有得到解决的机会。在这种情况下，双方都会有些人对个别问题抱着保留和怀疑的态度，这是可以理解的。但是，我相信，只要我们两国政府和人民坚决信守和平共处的五项原则，彼此以诚相见，我们的相互了解和信任就会日益增进，我们之间一切问题就都可以逐步求得公平合理的解决。大家知道，最近中缅两国政府曾经本着真诚和互谅的精神，就两国悬而未决的边界问题进行了友好的会谈。经过这次会谈，我们的相互了解有了进一步地增进。我们可以期待这一个历史上遗留下来的牵涉较广的问题，在两国人民一致的同意下获得公平合理的解决。
    近几年来，由于国民党残余武装在我们两国边境地区人民之间的骚扰，又由于我们两国之间还有相互不够了解的地方，居住在这个地区的两国边民之间的传统联系，如小额贸易，互相探望往来不免受到了阻挠和影响，这种情况是可以得到逐步改进的。就我们中国方面而言，我们一贯希望加强中缅友好和两国人民间的联系，但是我们对改进两国边境人民间联系的具体措施注意得还不够，在某些事情上还存在限制过严造成不方便的情况。我们准备在今后工作中改正这些缺点，同缅甸政府和人民一起努力把中缅友好和中缅边境人民的友好合作的工作做得更好，以符合两国人民的愿望。
    朋友们，同志们，使我们感到特别愉快的是，在我们两国边境上居住着同样的兄弟民族，今天在座就有不少这样的兄弟民族的代表。你们之间有着相同的血统、语言和风俗，共同喝一条江里的水。你们之间的悠久淳厚的传统关系，对发展中缅两国的友谊具有特殊重大的意义。我们应该十分珍重这种可贵的友谊，进一步发展两国边境人民的友好合作关系。为了做到这一点，我认为我国的边境人民应该比缅甸的边境人民作出更大的努力。由于中国是一个人口众多的国家，我们应该采取更多的主动措施，以自己的实际行动来证明我们对和平共处的五项原则的一贯信守不渝。对于我们友好邻邦的人民，我们要永远谦虚谨慎和耐心，坚决反对大国沙文主义。只要我们抱着这样的态度，我们两国边民之间以及两国人民之间的友谊就会不断地巩固，不断地增进。这样，两国边境地区就越容易得到发展和繁荣，两国边境人民也就可以生活得更加幸福愉快。
    这次大会的召开标志着中缅两国边境人民友好团结的更高的发展。我希望今后两国边境人民将能有更经常的会晤，更频繁的交往，使我们两国人民之间的亲戚般的友谊越加亲密，越加丰富起来。
    我再一次感谢吴巴瑞总理阁下和缅甸政府的其他领导人和贵宾们不远千里来参加我们的边民大会，感谢来自缅甸边境的各族朋友们，你们的来临使我们这个会充满了兄弟姊妹团聚的和睦和喜庆的气氛。我们很抱歉，没有能好好招待你们，请你们像原谅你们的兄弟一样地原谅我们。我希望你们把中国人民对缅甸人民的深厚友情和亲切的问候带回到缅甸去。我祝你们健康和愉快。
    中缅边境各族人民友好万岁！
    中缅两国人民友好万岁！
    和平共处的五项原则万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    祝缅甸联邦巴宇总统健康和长寿！　（新华社芒市16日电）
