    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21st: A cadmium sulfide semiconductor light-sensitive resistor was used to automatically control steel rolling, and the experiment was successful on the 18th at the Shanghai New Huf Steel Plant. The quality of the rolled steel all met the standards.
    In this experiment, the semiconductor was used on the finishing pass of the finishing mill to automatically control the tightness of the guide plates on this pass. In the past, on the finishing mill, the preceding passes all used shrouds, and the operation was mechanized; however, only the finishing pass, because of its stricter requirements, could not have the guide plates too tight or too loose, so shrouds could not be installed and it could only be operated manually. Now, using semiconductors to control the tightness allows the finishing pass to also fully utilize shrouds and implement mechanized operation.
    This application of semiconductors to steel rolling by the New Huf Steel Plant was carried out under the guidance and assistance of the Shanghai Precision Medical Equipment Factory, which manufactured the semiconductor photoresistor. Currently, technicians from both factories have formed a special group to further study how to formally put semiconductors into production as soon as possible.

    用半导体轧钢
    新华社上海21日电　用半导体硫化镉制成的光敏电阻来自动控制轧钢，18日在上海新沪钢铁厂试验成功；轧出的钢材质量全部合格。
    这次试验是把半导体用在精轧机的末道轧槽上，自动控制这道轧槽导板的松紧。过去，在精轧机上，前面的轧槽都使用了围盘，操作过程机械化了；但是只有末道轧槽因为要求比较严格，导板不能过紧或过松，所以不能装置围盘，只能用人工操作。现在用半导体来控制松紧，使末道轧槽也完全可以使用围盘，实行机械化操作。
    新沪钢铁厂这次把半导体运用在轧钢上，是在制成这种半导体光敏电阻的上海精密医疗器械厂的指导和帮助下进行的。现在，两个厂的技术人员已经共同组成一个专门小组，准备进一步研究尽快地把半导体正式用在生产上。
