Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 29th:
The Shanghai Labor Bureau recently made a great effort to tighten its use of office space, freeing up nearly two thousand square meters of housing area, which has solved the housing difficulties of some of its staff.

The Shanghai Labor Bureau conducted a comprehensive inspection of the use of its buildings. The results of the inspection led to a conscious effort among the staff of the entire bureau to carry out adjustments in the use of office space. Previously, the four bureau directors each occupied an office; now, two directors share one office. The personnel department originally used more than 400 square meters of housing; now, that has been reduced by 75%. The bureau implemented a method of "one room for multiple uses, multiple locations combined for use" for meeting rooms occupying large areas, reducing the original eight meeting rooms to three. Some surplus empty rooms and warehouses, after spending a small amount of money on renovation and reinforcement, have also been turned into employee dormitories.

    调整用屋腾出空房
    解决干部住宿困难
    上海市劳动局的作法很好
    据新华社上海29日电　上海市劳动局最近大力紧缩用屋，腾出近两千平方公尺面积的房屋，解决了一部分工作人员居住的困难。
    上海市劳动局曾对房屋的使用情况进行了全面检查。检查的结果引起了全局工作人员自觉地展开用屋调整工作。原来四个局长各占一个办公室，现在两个局长合用一间，人事部门原使用四百多平方公尺房屋，现在缩减了75％。对占面积较多的会议室实行“一室数用，数处合用”的办法，把原有八个会议室，减到三个。一些多余的空房和仓库，经过花费少量钱装修和加固以后，也变成了职工宿舍。
