Esteemed Chairman U Nu, Esteemed Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Dear Friends:

Please allow me to first express my gratitude to you for granting me the honor of inviting me to speak to the leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. In the name of the Chinese people, I extend to you my sincere respect.

In his speech, esteemed Chairman U Nu excessively praised me personally. I can only regard this praise as an expression of your deep friendship towards the Chinese people. I will convey your deep friendship to the Chinese people.

China and Burma are close neighbors. From very early times, the people of our two countries began friendly exchanges, which enriched our respective economic and cultural lives. For most of the time in history, our two countries have had extremely friendly relations. It was only when both our countries suffered from colonial enslavement and oppression that our close ties were artificially severed, and the colonialists tried their best to create divisions and discord between us to consolidate their colonial aggression.

However, countries that have achieved their independence will not allow the colonialists to continue to spread divisions and discord between us. After our two countries were freed from the shackles of colonialism, we quickly restored our friendly ties. Burma was one of the first countries to recognize China. In June 1954, during my first visit to Burma, Chairman U Nu and I issued a joint statement, jointly defining the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the principles guiding our bilateral relations. We unanimously believed that as long as these principles are observed, international threats and fears will eventually be replaced by a sense of security and mutual trust. In December 1954, during Chairman U Nu's visit to China, we further affirmed in a joint communiqué that we would resolve various existing problems between our two countries as soon as possible based on the Five Principles.

For the past two years, our two countries have developed friendly cooperation on the basis of the Five Principles. Our two countries have also sought reasonable solutions to some of the problems left to us by history, based on the Five Principles. During Chairman U Nu's visit to China in October and November this year, we conducted friendly discussions on the outstanding border issue and issued a joint communiqué. We firmly believe that on the basis of the Five Principles, the problems that exist between us can be gradually resolved. Of course, the divisions left over from history will not be completely eliminated in a short period of time. For a period of time, one party may still have a lack of understanding of the other. In this case, we believe that patient waiting is a wise policy.

The People's Republic of China is a newly emerging country, and it is also a country with a large population and vast land. A newly emerging great power can easily arouse suspicion in other countries. Therefore, China must be more strict with itself in its actions, resolutely implement the Five Principles in international relations, and oppose great-power chauvinism. We firmly believe that with the joint efforts of the people of our two countries, the problems existing between our two countries can be completely resolved through peaceful negotiations, and the friendly relations between our two countries will surely be continuously consolidated and developed.

Both China and Burma are countries that have only recently become independent. Although colonial rule has been overthrown, the disasters that colonialism has left to our two countries have not been completely eliminated. The living standards of the people of our two countries are still very low, and our industrial bases are still weak, let alone a complete industrial system. We are politically independent, but we are far from achieving complete economic independence. Experience has proved that any country that does not have its own industry and economic independence cannot guarantee its political independence and cannot be completely free from the danger of colonialist aggression.

Both China and Burma are working hard to build our own countries. We have also carried out some cooperation in our respective constructions. Our economic cooperation is equal and mutually beneficial and does not attach any conditions. It is fully in line with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We believe that such cooperation is conducive to the independent development of our two countries' economies, and at the same time, it does not exclude our cooperation with any other countries on the same basis.

In order to build our own countries, both of us need a peaceful international environment. Peace is the desire of the people of all countries in the world, especially the desire of the Asian and African people who urgently need to carry out construction.

Our two countries, China and Burma, have made a series of joint efforts in the cause of safeguarding world peace. The Five Principles jointly advocated by our two countries and India have been endorsed and supported by more and more countries in the world. The Bandung Conference, in which our two countries jointly participated, strengthened the unity of the Asian and African people, further isolated the forces of colonialism, and strengthened the forces for safeguarding world peace. Thanks to the joint efforts of our countries, other Asian and African countries, and all peace-loving countries in the world, the international situation has certainly tended to ease. It should be said that our joint efforts have been effective.

The colonialist aggression against Egypt does not show their strength; on the contrary, it is only a struggle of theirs in the upsurge of the Asian and African people's anti-colonialism. Now, thanks to the heroic resistance of the Egyptian people and the people of Arab countries, the resolute opposition of the Asian and African people, and the unanimous condemnation of all peace-loving countries and people, the colonialists have had to agree to withdraw their invading troops from Egypt. This once again shows that the era in which colonialists could do whatever they wanted has passed. Of course, we cannot give up our vigilance. The invading troops of Britain, France, and Israel have not yet withdrawn from Egypt, Egypt's territorial integrity and sovereignty have not been restored, the colonialists' conspiracies will continue to emerge, and the struggle against the aggressors is still a long-term struggle. However, we firmly believe that with the united solidarity and persistent struggle of the Egyptian people and all peace-loving forces in the world, colonialist aggressors can be completely defeated.

From the overall aspect of the current international situation, the forces for peace are developing day by day, and the groups that attempt to create tensions and provoke wars are becoming increasingly unpopular. We believe that in this situation, our two countries, China and Burma, should, together with all peace-loving countries and people in the world, hold high the banner of the Five Principles even higher and prove with practical actions that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully and that the Five Principles have great vitality.

China, Burma, and India are the initiators of the Five Principles. Our three countries should become models for the implementation of the Five Principles. The friendly cooperation between our three countries is not only conducive to the peaceful construction and independent development of our respective countries, but is also an extremely important factor in safeguarding peace in the Asian-African region and the world.

Friends, I once again thank Chairman U Nu for giving me such an honorable opportunity to speak to the leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma. Under the leadership of General Aung San, an outstanding son of Burma, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma once made significant contributions in the struggle against colonialism and for national independence. I congratulate you that under the leadership of Chairman U Nu, you will also play an important role in the cause of building the motherland and safeguarding peace.

Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!
Long live the solidarity of the Asian and African people!
Long live world peace!

### 在缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟领导人员大会上  周恩来总理的讲话

    在缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟领导人员大会上
    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的吴努主席阁下，敬爱的吴巴瑞总理阁下，亲爱的朋友们：
    请允许我首先向你们表示感谢，感谢你们给予我这样的荣誉，邀请我向反法西斯人民自由同盟的领导人员们讲话。我以中国人民的名义，向你们表示诚挚的敬意。
    吴努主席阁下在发言中，对我个人过分地称誉了。我只能把这种称誉看作是你们对中国人民的深厚友谊的表现。我将把你们的深厚友谊转达给中国人民。
    中国和缅甸是亲密的邻邦。从很早的时代起，我们两国人民就开始了友好的往来，这些友好往来丰富了我们各自的经济和文化生活。在历史上的绝大部分时期里，我们两国都有着极其友好的关系。只是到了我们两国都遭受到殖民主义奴役和压迫的时代，我们的亲密联系才被人为地割断了，而殖民主义者竭力在我们之间制造隔阂和不和，来实现他们巩固殖民主义侵略的目的。
    但是，取得了自己的独立的国家是不会容许殖民主义者在我们之间散布隔阂和不和的状况继续存在下去的。当我们两国摆脱了殖民主义的束缚以后，我们就迅速地恢复了我们之间的友好联系。缅甸是最早承认中国的国家之一，1954年6月，在我第一次访问缅甸的时候，吴努主席和我发表了联合声明，共同确定了和平共处的五项原则作为指导我们两国关系的原则。我们一致认为，只要这些原则能被遵守，国际间的威胁和恐惧终将会被安全感和互信所代替。1954年12月，吴努主席访华期间，我们在共同发表的公报中，更确定根据五项原则尽早地解决我们两国之间存在着的各项问题。
    两年以来，我们两国在五项原则的基础上发展了友好合作。我们两国也根据五项原则对历史遗留给我们的一些问题，寻求着合理的解决。在今年10月到11月吴努主席应邀访华期间，我们两国对悬而未决的边界问题又进行了友好的商谈，并且发表了联合公报。我们深信，在五项原则的基础上，我们之间所存在着的问题完全可以逐步求得解决。当然，由于历史上遗留下来的隔阂是不会一时完全消除的，在一个时期以内，一方对另一方不了解的情况还可能存在。在这种情况下我们认为耐心的等待是一种明智的政策。
    中华人民共和国是一个新兴的国家，也是一个人口众多、土地广阔的国家。一个新兴的大国是容易引起其他国家的疑惧的。因此，中国在它的行动中必须更严格地要求自己，在国际关系中，坚决地实施五项原则，反对大国沙文主义。我们深信，在我们两国人民的共同努力之下，我们两国之间存在的问题是完全可以经过和平谈判，求得合理解决的，我们两国的友好关系一定能够得到不断的巩固和发展。
    我们中缅两国都是独立不久的国家。殖民主义的统治虽然被推翻了，但是殖民主义遗留给我们两国的灾难却还没有完全清除。我们两国人民的生活水平都还很低，我们的工业基础都还薄弱，更谈不上一个完整的工业体系。我们在政治上独立了，但是我们都还远没有取得经济上的完全独立。经验证明，任何一个国家如果没有自己的工业，没有经济上的独立，就不能保障自己的政治独立，不能完全免于遭受殖民主义侵犯的危险。
    我们中缅两国都在努力建设我们自己的国家。在我们各自的建设中，我们也进行了一些合作。我们在经济上的合作是平等互利而不附带任何条件的，是完全符合于和平共处的五项原则的。我们相信，这样的合作是有利于我们两国经济的独立发展的，同时也决不排斥我们在同样的基础上同任何其他国家的合作。
    为了建设我们自己的国家，我们两国都需要一个和平的国际环境。和平是世界各国人民的愿望，尤其是迫切要求进行建设的亚非人民的愿望。
    我们中缅两国在保卫世界和平的事业中，进行了一系列的共同努力。我们两国同印度一起共同倡导的五项原则已经得到了世界上越来越多的国家的赞同和支持。我们两国共同参加的万隆会议加强了亚非人民的团结，进一步孤立了殖民主义的势力，壮大了保卫世界和平的力量。由于我们和亚非国家以及世界上一切爱好和平的国家的共同努力，国际形势曾经肯定地趋向于和缓。应该说，我们的共同努力是有成效的。
    殖民主义者对埃及的侵略，并不表现他们的强大；相反地，那只是他们在亚非人民反殖民主义高潮中的一种挣扎。现在，由于埃及人民和阿拉伯各国人民的英勇抵抗，亚非人民的坚决反对和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的一致谴责，殖民主义者不得不答应从埃及撤出他们的侵略军队。这就再一次表明殖民主义者为所欲为的时代已经过去了。当然，我们不能放弃警惕。英、法、以色列的侵略军队还没有撤出埃及，埃及的领土完整和主权还没有恢复，殖民主义者的阴谋还会层出不穷，反抗侵略者的斗争还是一个长期的斗争。但是，我们深信不疑，在埃及人民和世界上一切爱好和平的力量一致团结、坚持斗争的情况下，殖民主义侵略者是完全可以击败的。
    从目前国际局势的整个方面说来，爱好和平的力量一天一天在发展，企图制造紧张局势和挑起战争的集团越来越不得人心。我们认为在这种情况下，我们中缅两国更应该同世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，更高地举起五项原则的旗帜，用实际的行动来证明，不同社会制度的国家是可以和平共处的，五项原则是具有极大的生命力的。
    我们中国、缅甸和印度是五项原则的倡议者。我们三个国家应该成为实施五项原则的模范，我们三国的友好合作不仅有利于我们各国的和平建设和独立发展，而且也是保卫亚非地区和世界和平的一个极其重要的因素。
    朋友们，我再一次感谢吴努主席给我这样一个荣幸的机会向缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟的领导人员讲话。缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟在缅甸的优秀儿子昂山将军的领导之下，曾经在反对殖民主义和争取民族独立的斗争中作了重大的贡献。我祝贺你们在吴努主席领导下在建设祖国和保卫和平的事业中也将发挥重要的作用。
    中缅友好万岁！
    亚非人民团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
