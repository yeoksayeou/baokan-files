Xinhua News Agency, Meigu, 8th: The members and staff of the Third Route of the Second Branch of the Central Delegation, led by Deputy Leaders Wang Haimin, Yang Daiti, and Cui Jinglan, are extending condolences in the central area of Liangshan. They were in Meigu from the end of November until yesterday, and today they set off for Niuniuba.

As the delegation's horse team crossed the many mountains and valleys to enter this area, which had hardly ever been visited by outsiders before liberation, they were constantly welcomed by the local people. The Yi people put on ancient-style "bozhi" (formal attire) and waved long flags of various colors with "bue" (meaning pheasant tail) to cheer the delegation. Hundreds of Yi people from areas such as Linmu Jiagu and Hagu Yida went to Zhaojue to greet the delegation or transport supplies in advance.

The delegation held a grand condolence meeting in Meigu with more than 5,000 people participating, extending condolences to the Yi people of Meigu, government cadres, military personnel, and workers building the Yixi Highway, and presenting them with gifts of condolences, banners, and commemorative badges. During this period, the delegation sent personnel to visit various government units, hospitals, ethnic primary schools, and agricultural production cooperatives in Meigu County, conveying the Central Committee and Chairman Mao's concern for them, and listening to and soliciting their requests and opinions.

At the delegation's residence, Yi people and upper-level figures came almost every day. More than 70 upper-level figures from various areas also participated in the symposium of the Central Delegation. They talked about democratic reform and thanked the government for its care in their work and lives. They expressed to the delegation that they would make greater contributions to continuing the completion of the county's democratic reform.

These days, Meigu County has been particularly lively. People come from far away to see the people sent by the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and there are even crowds sleeping on the streets at night. The delegation's Peking Opera troupe performed six shows day and night for the people. At welcome parties and in agricultural cooperatives, they similarly performed their own ethnic dances, songs, and instrumental music to entertain their relatives.

During this period, the delegation's doctors treated more than 1,300 people (including return visits).

Words of gratitude and affection filled everyone's hearts. When people received the cold-weather clothing and food for condolences and compared them with their original simple clothing, many people shed tears. Biri Lao Mama from Ziwu Township, watching her fifteen-year-old son, who had never worn cloth clothes before, put on the cold-weather clothing, said excitedly: "Chairman Mao has brought us land, food, and also issued us clothes. This kind of care is even deeper than our parents'." People used various methods to express their feelings. Three agricultural cooperatives in Linmu Jiagu District presented the first harvest of round roots (radishes) and eggs from their land to entertain their relatives during the delegation's visit. The Meigu County Labor People's Association and the Meigu Office of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Government, on behalf of the people of the county, presented Chairman Mao with a set of Yi clothing, colorful wooden bowls, and Meigu's handicraft – a delicate bamboo silk top hat. Farmers in Fucheng District, when presenting two corn samples, said: "In the past, the corn on the slave owners' land was only the size of a 'waboaeqie' (chicken head). Today, our corn is long and big. Please take it to Chairman Mao so that Chairman Mao can see it and like it."

### 中央慰问团二分团第三路　在凉山中心地区慰问

    中央慰问团二分团第三路
　　在凉山中心地区慰问
    据新华社美姑8日电　中央慰问团第二分团第三路的团员和工作人员在副团长王海民、杨代蒂、崔景岚的率领下正在凉山中心地区进行慰问。他们从11月底到昨天在美姑慰问，今天已动身前往牛牛坝。
    当慰问团的马队越过重重山岭和峡谷进入这个解放前几乎从无外人来到的地区时，沿途不断受到当地人民的欢迎。彝族人民穿起古代式样的“博之”（礼服），高举着“布额”（意为雉尾）的各种颜色的长旗向慰问团欢呼。林木甲谷、哈古以达等区几百个彝民到昭觉去迎接或为慰问团事先运输物资。
    慰问团在美姑举行了五千多人参加的盛大的慰问大会，向美姑彝族人民、机关干部、部队人员和修筑宜西公路的工人进行慰问，赠送慰问品、锦旗和纪念章。在这期间，慰问团派出人员分别访问了美姑县各机关单位、医院、民族小学和林木甲谷区的农业生产合作社，传达了中央和毛主席对他们的关怀，听取和征求了他们的要求和意见。
    在慰问团的驻地，几乎每天都有彝族人民和上层人士来到这里，七十多个来自各区的上层人士还参加了中央慰问团的座谈会。他们谈论民主改革，感谢政府对他们工作和生活的照顾。他们纷纷向慰问团表示，一定要更好地为继续完成全县的民主改革而贡献出自己的力量。
    这些天来，美姑县特别热闹。人们从很远的地方来看中央和毛主席派来的人，入夜以后还有露宿在街上的人群。慰问团的京剧队日夜为人们演出了六场节目。在欢迎的晚会中、在农业社里，他们同样地表演了自己的民族舞蹈、歌唱和器乐演奏来招待亲人。
    这期间慰问团的医生们为一千三百多人（包括复诊人数）看了病。
    感激的语言和情意充满每个人的心头。当人们得到慰问的寒衣和粮食对比着原有简陋的衣着时，许多人流下泪来。孑威乡的比日老妈妈看着自己十五岁还未穿过布衣的儿子穿上寒衣时激动地说：“毛主席给我们带来了土地、粮食、又发给我们衣服，这种关怀比父母还要深。”人们用各种办法来表达自己的心意。林木甲谷区三个农业社在慰问团访问时纷纷拿出自己土地上第一次收获的圆根（萝卜）和鸡蛋招待亲人。美姑县劳动人民协会和自治州人民政府美姑办事处代表全县人民把一套彝族服装、彩色的木碗和美姑的工艺品——精巧的竹丝礼帽献给毛主席。附城区农民在献上两个玉米样品时说：“往年在奴隶主土地上的玉米只有‘瓦博挨且’（鸡头）那样大，今天我们的玉米又长又大，请带给毛主席，让毛主席看见也喜欢。”
