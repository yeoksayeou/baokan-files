    Pakistani People Welcome Premier Zhou
    By our correspondent Hu Qi
    Bearing the friendship of the Chinese people, the Chinese Premier arrived in Pakistan for the first time in history. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long and other accompanying personnel received an unprecedentedly warm reception here.
    As early as before the plane arrived, about 10,000 people had gathered at the airport, waving thousands of red Chinese national flags and green Pakistani national flags. There were also countless flags and banners with slogans such as "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship," "Long Live World Peace," and "Welcome Zhou Enlai" written in Chinese, Urdu, and English.
    At nearly three o'clock in the afternoon on December 20, the plane carrying Premier Zhou flew over the airport. The five thousand male and female elementary school students lined up at the airport below immediately formed the Chinese characters for "Welcome" and the Pakistani national emblem: the shape of a crescent and a star. These characters and shapes could be clearly seen from the plane. At exactly three o'clock in the afternoon, the plane landed on the runway and taxied to where the crowd welcoming the Chinese Premier and his entourage were standing. A moment later, Premier Zhou appeared at the cabin door, at which point cheers of "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship" and "Long Live Zhou Enlai" resounded throughout the airport. Prime Minister Suhrawardy was the first to step forward to greet Premier Zhou as he descended the stairs. The two Prime Ministers embraced each other—a sign of the enhanced friendship between the two countries.
    Among the welcoming crowd were elderly people with gray beards and elementary school students dressed in white. Adult women and girls wore colorful costumes and carried bouquets. The children were all dressed in beautiful new clothes. In order to catch a glimpse of Premier Zhou, many people climbed onto cars and even climbed onto the roof of the airport office. When Premier Zhou and Vice Premier He passed in front of the crowd, people swarmed forward. Flowers rained down on Premier Zhou and Vice Premier He.
    Along the ten-mile road leading to the Presidential Palace in the city center, hundreds of thousands of people waved their hands and cheered as the motorcade, led by Premier Zhou's car, passed by. On the bustling sidewalks of the city center, the crowds heading to welcome the delegation were packed tightly, and the windows of all the buildings facing the street were filled with smiling faces.
    At eight o'clock that evening, President Mirza held a grand banquet to welcome Premier Zhou. The banquet was held on a lawn, which was decorated and illuminated with clusters of colored light bulbs hanging from the branches of trees. The lights were reflected in the bottom of a pool next to the lawn in changing colors. More than two hundred prominent figures attended the banquet. After dinner, the Chinese guests were invited to watch a wonderful performance by a bagpipe band, whose music was very similar to some Chinese folk songs.
    Early the next morning, Premier Zhou paid his respects at the "Mausoleum of the Great Leader" and the "Mausoleum of the National Leader," where the deceased founders of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and the first Prime Minister of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan, are buried. Premier Zhou laid wreaths at their tombs.
    After paying respects at these mausoleums, Premier Zhou and his entourage drove to Mauripur Airport, ten miles away, to watch an air force performance.
    That afternoon, a mass rally was held at Frere Hall. There were many archways in the building, some of which were in the Chinese style and were engraved with dragon patterns. Chinese and Pakistani national flags fluttered above the main entrance. The podium where Premier Zhou and other Chinese guests were located was decorated with Chinese palace lanterns. Karachi Municipal Commissioner Altaf Gauhar first delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the citizens of Karachi. Premier Zhou gave a reply. After he finished speaking, he stepped down from the podium and cut a knife into a large cake weighing three hundred pounds. The cake was decorated with a globe, on which were maps of China and Pakistan, and a Chinese star was placed on top of the globe. After the cake was cut, pigeons flew out of the cake. Cheers shook the entire building.
    People from all walks of life in Karachi regard Premier Zhou's visit as a major event in Pakistani history, and believe that it not only plays an important role in promoting friendship between China and Pakistan, but also has significant implications for easing the world situation.
    On the day Premier Zhou arrived in Karachi, all Urdu and English newspapers published the news of the visit on their front pages. Many newspapers introduced Premier Zhou's life and China's progress in recent years in special columns. "Dawn" published an editorial saying that the welcome to Premier Zhou was sincere and unreserved, and pointed out that different viewpoints should not hinder cooperation between people with different lifestyles.
    On the street, I met many Pakistanis who told me that the Pakistani people have feelings for the Chinese people, and the Pakistani people believe that China is a good neighbor. On another occasion, when talking about Pakistani grain and floods, the Minister of Food, who was very familiar with the situation, expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for the assistance provided when Pakistan was in difficulty. This assistance and the way it was provided are proof of the Chinese people's good faith.
    As Premier Zhou pointed out, the combination of the friendly sentiments and peaceful aspirations of the Chinese and Pakistani peoples is the foundation of friendly cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese people share the same ideals and sentiments. The mutual visits of the two Prime Ministers have further consolidated and strengthened the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples, which is not only beneficial to the two peoples, but also beneficial to world peace.

    巴基斯坦人民欢迎周总理
    本报记者　胡骑
    怀着来自中国人民的友谊，中国总理历史上第一次来到了巴基斯坦。周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和其他随行人员在这里受到了空前热烈的接待。
    早在飞机抵达以前，就有约一万人齐集在机场上，手里摇着数千面红色的中国国旗和绿色的巴基斯坦国旗。还有无数面旗帜和标语牌，上面用中文、乌尔都文和英文写着“巴中友谊万岁”“世界和平万岁”“欢迎周恩来”等标语。
    12月20日下午快三点钟的时候，周总理所乘坐的飞机飞临机场上空。下面在机场上列队欢迎的五千名男女小学生立刻排列成中文“欢迎”的字样和巴基斯坦的国徽：新月和星的形状，这些字和形状可以从飞机上清楚地看出来。在下午正三点钟的时候，飞机降落到跑道上来并滑行到欢迎中国总理和他的随行人员的群众所站立的地方。一会儿之后，周总理就从机舱的门口出现，这时在整个机场上就响彻了“巴中友谊万岁”、“周恩来万岁”的欢呼声。苏拉瓦底总理首先走上前迎接从梯子上走下来的周总理。两位总理互相拥抱——这是两国友谊增强的标志。
    欢迎的群众中有胡须灰白的老人，也有穿着白衣服的小学生。成年妇女和女孩子们穿着各种颜色的服装并带着花束。孩子们都穿着美丽的新衣服。为了要看周总理一眼，很多人爬到汽车上甚至还攀登到机场办事处的屋顶上去。当周总理和贺副总理经过群众面前的时候，人们就蜂拥而前。花朵像雨点似地倾倒在周总理和贺副总理的身上。
    沿着通往市中心总统府的长达十英里的道路两旁，有成千上万的人在以周总理的车子为前导的汽车队伍通过时，都高举着手，欢呼不已。在热闹的市区的行人便道上，前往欢迎的人群挤得水泄不通，所有临街的建筑物的窗子上都挤满了面带笑容的脸孔。
    当晚八时，米尔扎总统为欢迎周总理举行了盛大的宴会。宴会是在一片草坪上举行，这个草坪是用悬挂在树枝上的一簇簇的彩色灯泡所点缀和装饰起来的。草坪旁一个水池的池底以变幻的颜色反映出了电灯的光线。两百多名著名人士出席了这次宴会。晚餐以后，中国客人被邀请去看一个精彩的吹风笛的乐队的表演，这个乐队所吹奏的乐曲很像中国的一些民歌。
    第二天一早，周总理晋谒了“伟大领袖陵墓”和“国家领袖陵墓”，去世的巴基斯坦创始人穆罕默德·阿里·真纳和巴基斯坦第一任总理利雅卡特·阿里汗就埋在这里。周总理向他们的墓前献了花圈。
    在晋谒过这些陵墓以后，周总理和他的随行人员就驱车前往十英里以外的毛里普尔机场去参观空军表演。
    在这天下午，在福里尔大厦举行了一次群众性欢迎大会。在大厦中有许多拱门，有些拱门是中国式的，上面还刻着龙的图案。在正门上飘扬着中国和巴基斯坦的国旗。在周总理和其他中国客人所在的讲台上，饰有中国的宫灯。卡拉奇市政专员阿勒塔弗·高豪尔代表卡拉奇市民首先致欢迎词。周总理作了答词。在他讲完话以后，就走下讲台，向一只重达三百磅的大饼上切了一刀。在这个大饼上装有一个地球，球上有中国和巴基斯坦的地图，球顶上则装着一颗中国的星。在饼子被切开以后，就有鸽子从饼里飞出来。欢呼声震动了整个大厦。
    卡拉奇各阶层人士把周总理的访问视为巴基斯坦历史上的大事，并且认为，它不仅对促进中巴两国之间的友谊起了重要作用，而且对和缓世界局势也具有重大的意义。
    当周总理到达卡拉奇那一天，所有乌尔都文和英文报纸在头版刊载了这次访问的消息。许多报纸在特栏上介绍了周总理的生平和中国在过去几年来的进步。“黎明报”发表社论说，对周总理的欢迎是诚意的，无保留的。并指出，不同观点不应该妨碍不同生活方式的人们之间的合作。
    在街上，我遇到许多巴基斯坦人，他们告诉我，巴基斯坦人民对中国人民有感情，巴基斯坦人民认为中国是个好邻居。在另一个场合，当谈到关于巴基斯坦粮食和水灾时，很熟悉这方面情况的粮食部长表示感谢中国人民在巴基斯坦困难时所提供的援助，这种援助以及援助的方式就是中国人民有很好诚意的证明。
    正如周总理指出的，中巴人民友好的情感与和平愿望结合一起是两国友好合作的基础。中国人民具有同样的理想和情感。两位总理通过互相访问，进一步巩固和加强了中巴两国人民的友谊，它不仅对两国人民有利，而且对世界和平有利。
