Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 8th. In order to consolidate the peace and tranquility of the capital, the Budapest Police Headquarters recently arrested a group of counter-revolutionaries and people with major counter-revolutionary suspicions. The arrests were carried out at the request of residents and with their assistance.

Among the arrested counter-revolutionaries and suspects are Mitchinai, who murdered honest workers; Haras, who sabotaged railway tracks; Oberovsky, who printed and distributed reactionary leaflets; and Geza Kovacs, who infiltrated factory workers' committees and used factory machines to print counter-revolutionary leaflets.

In the sixth district of Budapest, police officers seized a bandit's car, seized three guns and two hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition, a typewriter, and arrested four bandits on the spot.

Many of the captured criminals were hidden in factory workers' committees. As the workers' awareness increases, these counter-revolutionaries are increasingly unable to deceive the masses of workers.

According to an announcement issued by the Budapest Police Headquarters: Suspects who are arrested and proven to be innocent will be released. Real criminals will be handed over to the Prosecutor's Office for trial.

　　匈警察局逮捕一批反革命分子
    新华社布达佩斯8日电　布达佩斯警察总局为了巩固首都的和平和安宁，最近逮捕了一批反革命分子和有重大反革命嫌疑的人。逮捕是根据居民的要求并且在居民的协助下进行的。
    被逮捕的反革命分子和嫌疑分子中，有杀害正直工人的米奇纳伊，破坏铁轨的哈拉斯，印刷和散发反动传单的奥别罗夫斯基，还有混入工厂工人委员会用工厂机器印刷反革命传单的格扎·科瓦奇等人。
    在布达佩斯市第六区，警察局人员查获了一辆匪徒的汽车，当场搜出三支枪和二百五十发子弹，一架打字机，并且逮捕了四个匪徒。
    在捕获的犯罪分子中，有许多是隐藏在工厂工人委员会里的。由于工人们觉悟日益提高，这些反革命分子愈来愈不能欺骗工人群众了。
    据布达佩斯警察总局发出的公告说：被逮捕的嫌疑分子，如证实的确没有犯过罪，将获得释放。而真正的犯罪分子将移交检察署审判。
