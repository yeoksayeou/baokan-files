　　Delivering Luggage to Homes
    This newspaper reports that the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Shanghai Station began offering a luggage delivery service for passengers on November 30th. Passengers arriving in Shanghai who are in a hurry to reach their destination, do not have time to collect their luggage, or find it inconvenient to carry their luggage themselves, can hand their luggage ticket to the luggage delivery service on the platform after getting off the train and entrust them to deliver the luggage to a designated location. The procedure is very simple, and the fees are not high. (Chen Yingkang)

　  把行李送到家
    本报讯　上海铁路管理局上海车站11月30日开始办理为旅客代送行李的业务。旅客乘车到达上海后，如急需到达目的地，无暇领取行李，或自己携带行李感到不便，下车后在月台上就可以将行李票交给行李代送处，委托他们将行李送到指定处所，手续很简便，取费也不多。（陈英康）
