Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, December 3rd: Pakistan's Prime Minister Suhrawardy, in a speech on Pakistan's foreign policy in Lahore on December 2nd, said that Pakistan "has very good relations with China." He said that the Chinese Premier will soon be coming to Pakistan, "where he will receive a warm welcome that will move him."

In his speech to the Islamic College Alumni Association, Suhrawardy said: "Our best policy is to be friendly to everyone and have no malice towards anyone." He said: "We need peace, we need an independent foreign policy, because that is what independence means."

At the same time, Suhrawardy also strongly attacked the policy of neutrality in his speech, calling the pursuit of neutrality by many countries "neutrality worship." He said that neutrality means turning a blind eye to reality in the event of a world-scale war, and blackmail in times of peace.

He attacked Egyptian President Nasser for adopting a policy of neutrality, saying that because Nasser adopted neutrality, "no Arab country aided him."

While Suhrawardy expressed that the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt should be condemned, he also said that the Anglo-French invasion's "purpose was to limit the sovereignty of a certain country for the benefit of the whole world."

Suhrawardy once again defended the Baghdad Pact, saying that the treaty was defensive. He opposed the demand for Britain to withdraw from the Baghdad Pact. He said, why do the four Muslim countries participating in this treaty "not want a strong man to stand beside you to protect you?"

He also said: "Even if the United States does not participate in this treaty, we can still rely on its assistance."

Suhrawardy also attacked Indian Prime Minister Nehru, saying that Nehru opposed the Baghdad Pact because he wanted to see Pakistan isolated and weak.

    苏拉瓦底谈巴基斯坦外交政策
　　巴基斯坦同中国关系非常良好
    新华社卡拉奇3日电　巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底12月2日在拉合尔发表关于巴基斯坦的外交政策演说时说，巴基斯坦“同中国有着非常良好的关系”。他说，中国总理不久就要到巴基斯坦来，“他将在这里受到使他感动的热烈欢迎”。
    苏拉瓦底在伊斯兰学院校友会上发表的这篇演说中说：“我们最好的政策是对一切人亲善，而对任何人没有恶意。”他说：“我们需要和平，我们需要一项独立的外交政策，因为这就是独立所意味着的东西。”
    同时，苏拉瓦底又在演说中强烈地攻击中立政策，把许多国家奉行中立政策说成是“中立崇拜”。他说，中立在发生世界规模的战争时意味着不正视现实，在和平时期又意味着一种讹诈。
    他攻击埃及总统纳赛尔采取中立政策说，纳赛尔因为采取了中立，所以“没有一个阿拉伯国家援助他”。
    苏拉瓦底一面表示，英法侵略埃及应当受到谴责，但同时又说，英法侵略的“目的是为了全世界的利益而去限制某个国家的主权”。
    苏拉瓦底又一次为巴格达条约辩护，说这个条约是防御性的。他反对要求英国退出巴格达条约。他说，参加这个条约的四个穆斯林国家为什么“不要一个有力气的人站在你的旁边来保护你呢”？
    他还说：“美国即使不参加这个条约，我们同样可以依靠它的援助。”
    苏拉瓦底还攻击印度总理尼赫鲁说，尼赫鲁所以反对巴格达条约，是因为他想看到巴基斯坦孤立无援和软弱无能。
