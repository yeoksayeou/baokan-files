Zhanjiang Port (and another poem)
  Sun Bin
    One
    A pedicab pulled us to a large gate. This was the port's office building. The newly built wharf was to the right of the building, the gantry crane's arm pointing high into the sky. The construction site was bustling with the sounds of various machines - dredgers were dredging, bulldozers were clearing the storage yard outside the warehouse, and young men on the gantry cranes were learning to operate them. Before we could even drink a bowl of water, unfamiliar guests had burst into the dock. This is another victory for the motherland's construction. How could one not be happy?

    Two
    Zhanjiang Port! How resounding is your name, and people feel proud when they talk about you. The newspapers use large-character headlines, one photograph after another. Shanghai Port, Dalian Port, Tanggu New Port... you are all sisters born of the same mother. Standing together with them, you appear so strong and young. You are a constellation of stars on the coast, Zhanjiang Port! This star of yours, Beijing can also see your light over Leizhou Bay.

    Three
    The ships are still outside Haozhou Island, like the beach stretching out an arm, the gantry cranes on the wharf are waving to you. The ships are still outside Haozhou Island, like the sea is roaring, the port's various machines are cheering for the guests from afar. The ships are still outside Haozhou Island, like a rainbow hanging in the sky, red flags are flying over the port, celebrating this opening day.

    Four
    The bustling Chikan, the scenic Dongying, those newly built high-rise buildings, how can they compare with you. Zhanjiang Port! You are on Leizhou Bay, looking east to Huangpu, south to Yulin, your light shines brightly, all the way to the very distant sea... The Qizhou Ocean roars day and night, flocks of seagulls, fleets of ships, only your heroic voice can overwhelm all the singing.

    湛江港（外一首）
  　孙滨
    一三轮车拉我们到一家大门口，这正是港口的办公大楼，新建的码头就在大楼的右边，龙门吊的臂膀高高地指向天空。工地喧腾着各种机械的声音——挖泥船在进行挖泥，推土机在清扫着仓库外边的堆场，龙门吊上小伙子们在学习操作。我们还没有喝下一碗水，陌生的客人就闯进了码头，这是祖国又一工程的胜利，怎不叫人高兴。
    二湛江港！你的名多么响亮，谈起你的人也感到骄傲，报上用大字标题，照片一张接着一张。上海港、大连港、塘沽新港……你们都是亲娘生的姊妹，你和她们站在一起，显得多么壮实又年轻。你们这海岸的星群，湛江港！你这颗星，北京也能看见你雷州湾上的光芒。
    三船只还在濠洲岛外，好像海滩伸出来臂膀，码头上的龙门吊，在向着你招手。船只还在濠洲岛外，好像海在喧腾，港口的各种机械，在为着远道的客人欢呼。船只还在濠洲岛外，好像彩虹挂在天边，港口飘扬着红旗，庆祝这开港的节日。
    四人声鼎沸的赤坎，风景优异的东营，那些新建的高楼大厦，怎么能和你相比。湛江港！你在雷州湾上，东望黄埔，南望榆林，你的光芒闪闪，一直到很远很远的海上……七洲洋在日夜的喧腾，成群的海鸥，成队的船只，只有你那豪壮的嗓门，能把一切的歌声都压倒。
