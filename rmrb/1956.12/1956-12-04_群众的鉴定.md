　　The Appraisal of the Masses
　　Chang Ren
    In an ordinary agricultural cooperative in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, cooperative cadres were casually discussing their experiences and lessons learned during the cooperative's development with me. They naturally made fair evaluations of the county and district cadres who had helped them with their work. "This matter was handled well with the help of Comrade So-and-so." "That matter was forced upon us by Comrade So-and-so using commandism."
    They told me that the cooperative originally had a cooperative director who was selfish and used commandism, and he was recently removed by the members through a re-election. Now they have elected a new director. I asked, "Since you knew this person was not good, why did you elect him as the cooperative director in the first place?" The cooperative cadres laughed and said, "This was all arranged by Comrade Li. The members originally didn't want to elect him, but because Comrade Li favored him, he assured the members that if he became the cooperative director, he would overcome his shortcomings and correct his mistakes. Comrade Li worked hard on ideological persuasion, and the members reluctantly raised their hands."
    When Comrade Li's name was mentioned, everyone had a lot to say. One cooperative cadre said, "Comrade Li was the king of commandism." He then jokingly talked about an incident in the spring: At that time, the pond was still frozen, and Comrade Li, in order to start a high tide of manure accumulation, forced the members to go into the pond to dig pond mud. The cooperative cadres were even forced to take the lead in going into the frozen pond to dig pond mud. Sure enough, some achievements were made in digging pond mud. So Comrade Li reported to the higher authorities, saying how high the masses' enthusiasm for production was.
    One cooperative cadre, who had taken the lead in digging pond mud, laughed and said, "Actually, who really wanted to go into the water at that time? It was just because Comrade Li was urging us so tightly that we gritted our teeth and took the lead."
    These things left a deep impression on the minds of the cooperative cadres. After Comrade Li left, and it became clear that Comrade Li had done some foolish things, they treated these things as jokes when they talked about them. In this laughter, there is such sharp criticism!
    Naturally, those work cadres who had a good work style and did good things for the cooperative, even though they had been gone for a long time, when people mentioned them, their words were filled with praise and respect.
    At that time, I thought: If Comrade Li, after leaving this cooperative, could come back to see the effect of his work at that time and listen to the comments of the masses, what a great gain that would be for him! If Comrade Li's direct superiors wanted to check Comrade Li's past work, and the organization department wanted to understand the ideological style of the cadres who went to the countryside, if everyone could often come down to listen to the comments of the masses, then they would gain such an important appraisal of our cadres from the masses.

　　群众的鉴定
　　长任
    在湖南省宁乡县一个普通的农业社里，社干部有一次和我闲谈起他们办社过程中许多经验教训的时候，他们都自然地对曾在这里帮助他们工作过的县、区干部作出了公正的评价。“这件是某同志帮助搞的，处理得好。”“那件事么，是某同志在这里强迫命令干起来的。”
    他们告诉我，这个社里原来有一个社主任，因为他自私自利，强迫命令，最近被社员们改选掉了。现在又选了一位新的主任。我就问：“既然知道这个人不好，当初为什么选上他担任社主任呢？”社干部们笑着说：“这都是李同志在这里包办的。社员原来就不愿意选他，因为李同志看中了他，就向社员保证，他当了社主任一定会克服缺点，改正错误。李同志左打通思想，右说服教育，社员只好马马虎虎地举了手。”
    一提起李同志的事来，大家的话就多了。有个社干部说：“李同志是强迫命令的大王。”他接着嘻嘻哈哈谈起春天一件事情：那时塘里还结着冰，李同志为了掀起积肥高潮，就逼着社员下塘挖塘泥，社干部更是被逼着带头下到结冰的塘里去挖塘泥。果然，挖塘泥取得了一些成绩。于是李同志向上汇报，说是群众的生产热情如何高涨。
    曾经带头挖塘泥的一位社干部笑着说：“其实那时候谁真正愿意下水呢？就是因为李同志紧催着，我们是咬着牙带头的。”
    这些事情在社干部们的脑子里的印象是很深刻的。当李同志走了，事实证明李同志做下了一些蠢事之后，他们一提起来，就把这些当作笑料。这一笑之间，是多么尖锐的批评啊！
    自然，那些作风好的，为社里办了好事的工作干部，虽然他们走了好久了，但人们一提起他们来，言词中都带着赞美和敬意。
    当时我就想：要是李同志在离开这个社之后，再来看一看他当时帮助工作的效果，听听群众的评论，那对他该有多大的收获！如果李同志的直接领导要检查李同志过去的工作，组织部门要了解下乡干部的思想作风，大家能常常下来听听群众的评论，那他们又将获得多么重要的群众对我们干部的鉴定。
