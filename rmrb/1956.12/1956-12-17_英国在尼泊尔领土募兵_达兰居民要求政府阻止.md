    Britain Recruits Soldiers in Nepalese Territory
    Residents of Dharan Demand Government Intervention
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 15th: The "Times of India" reports that Britain is establishing recruitment offices in Dharan, located in eastern Nepal on the border of India's Darjeeling district, to recruit local Gurkhas to serve as soldiers for the British.

    A 1953 agreement between Britain and Nepal allows Britain to establish recruitment stations in Dharan.

    The newspaper reports that residents of Dharan oppose the British recruiting soldiers locally. Nepalese residents living in the area have sent a memorandum to their government, requesting the government to prevent British recruitment. The memorandum states that local people will take action to resist if British recruitment in the area is not stopped.

    英国在尼泊尔领土募兵
    达兰居民要求政府阻止
    据新华社新德里15日电　“印度时报”报道，英国正在尼泊尔东部、印度大吉岭区边界上的达兰建立募兵办事处，招募当地的廓尔喀人去给英国人当兵。
    1953年英国和尼泊尔签订的协定允许英国在达兰建立募兵站。
    报纸的消息说，达兰的居民反对英国人在当地募兵。住在当地的尼泊尔人已经向他们的政府送去一份备忘录，要求政府阻止英国募兵。消息说，这项备忘录表示，当地人民将要采取行动来进行抵制，如果英国在这个地方进行募兵的事没有被制止的话。
