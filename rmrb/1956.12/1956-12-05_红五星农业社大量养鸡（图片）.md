Hongwuxing Agricultural Cooperative Raises Chickens on a Large Scale
    This spring, the Hongwuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Tianjin incubated 6,500 Leghorn chickens. They adopted a greenhouse brooding method, strengthened feeding management and environmental sanitation, and achieved a chick survival rate of over 91%. Since they started raising chickens, there have been no epidemics. These chickens have begun to lay eggs. According to the leader of the cooperative's chicken raising group, each chicken can lay an average of 180 eggs per year; 3,000 chickens can generate a profit of at least 30,000 yuan per year.

　　红五星农业社大量养鸡
    天津市红五星农业社今春孵育莱克亨鸡六千五百只。他们采取了温室育雏的办法，加强了饲养管理和环境卫生工作，使小鸡的成活率达到91％以上。养鸡以来，没有闹过疫病。这群鸡已开始生蛋。据该社养鸡组长估计，每只鸡一年平均可生蛋一百八十枚；三千只鸡一年至少可获利三万元。　　　　熊大沸摄
