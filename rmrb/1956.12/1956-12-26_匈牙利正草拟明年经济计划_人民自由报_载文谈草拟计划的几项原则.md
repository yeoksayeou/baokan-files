Xinhua News Agency, December 25th dispatch: According to the Hungarian News Agency on the 24th, "People's Freedom" published an important article entitled "A New Form of Socialist Planned Economy," discussing the main aspects of the principles to be followed when Hungary formulates future economic plans.

The article said that the principles on which the 1957 plan, which is currently being drafted, is based are: First, everything will depend on power resources. Electricity must be obtained from neighboring countries and the Soviet Union. The level of industrial production in 1957 will be lower than in previous years. Production in industrial sectors that consume a large amount of power and use little labor will be temporarily reduced in order to reduce unemployment. In order to maintain living standards and prevent inflation, light industry and the food industry will not be affected by this restriction. Second, in order to compensate for the losses caused by the cessation of exports, we should request loans from socialist countries and capitalist countries. Third, investment should be reduced, and those industrial sectors that use the most labor should be reduced less; in agriculture, the focus should be on intensive cultivation in order to increase production.

    匈牙利正草拟明年经济计划
    “人民自由报”载文谈草拟计划的几项原则
    新华社25日讯　据匈牙利通讯社24日讯：“人民自由报”以“新形式的社会主义计划经济”为题发表了一篇重要文章，论述匈牙利制定将来的经济计划时所要遵循的原则的主要方面。
    文章说，目前正在草拟的1957年计划所依据的原则是：第一，一切将依据动力资源，必须从邻国和苏联取得电力，1957年的工业生产水平将低于前几年的水平，将暂时削减大量消耗动力而使用人工不多的工业部门的生产，以便减少失业。为了维持生活水平和防止通货膨胀，轻工业和食品工业将不受这种限制的影响。第二，为了弥补由于中止出口而受到的损失，我们应该向社会主义国家和资本主义国家要求贷款。第三，应该减少投资，而使用人工最多的那些工业部门应当减少得少一些；在农业中，重点应该放在深耕细作上，以便提高产量。
