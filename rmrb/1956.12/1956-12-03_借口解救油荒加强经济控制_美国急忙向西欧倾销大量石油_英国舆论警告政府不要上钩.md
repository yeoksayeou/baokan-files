Xinhua News Agency, December 1st dispatch from Washington: The United States Defense Mobilization Agency announced on November 30th the implementation of an "emergency plan" to export oil to Western Europe, in order to relieve the domestic oil shortage in Britain and France caused by their aggression against Egypt.

According to Reuters, under this plan, the United States will provide Western Europe with 1.1 million barrels of oil per day from the Western Hemisphere.

This measure by the U.S. government is intended to make up for the recent crisis that erupted within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. French Ambassador to the United States, Dillon, said upon returning to New York on November 30th that because "there was no certainty of obtaining American oil, anti-American sentiment arose in France, just like anti-American sentiment in Britain."

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd dispatch from London: British newspapers, in commenting on the British government's planned purchase of oil from the United States, uneasily pointed out that the Anglo-French aggression against Egypt damaged Britain's economic position and deepened Britain's dependence on the United States.

	The "Financial Times" said that every round of the nearly thirty-year struggle between Britain and the United States for spheres of influence in the Near East has "reduced Britain's share of Middle Eastern oil resources somewhat."

Speaking of Britain's plan to buy oil from the United States, many newspaper commentators pointed out that this would lead to the depletion of Britain's gold and dollar reserves and would weaken Britain's economic position. Even some right-wing politicians in Britain are not satisfied with this plan. Conservative Party member of Parliament Williams pointed out in a speech at a mass rally in Nottingham on November 30th, "Due to the current situation of the Suez Canal, Britain has no choice but to buy American oil, which requires a large number of dollars, but Britain already has too few dollars."

Some other newspapers also pointed out that even if the United States supplies oil, it will not solve Britain's oil crisis.

    借口解救油荒加强经济控制
　　美国急忙向西欧倾销大量石油
    英国舆论警告政府不要上钩
    据新华社1日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国防动员署在11月30日宣布实行“紧急计划”向西欧输出石油，以解救英、法两国因侵略埃及而引起的国内的石油荒。
    据路透社报道，根据这项计划，美国每天将从西半球为西欧提供一百一十万桶石油。
    美国政府这个措施，是要弥补北大西洋集团内部新近爆发的危机。法国驻美大使狄龙在11月30日回到纽约时曾说，因为“没有把握得到美国的石油，法国产生了反美情绪，就像英国的反美情绪一样”。
    据新华社2日讯　伦敦消息：英国报刊在评论英国政府正在拟订的向美国购买石油的计划时不安地指出，英法侵略埃及损害了英国的经济地位，加深了英国对美国的依赖。
      “金融时报”说，英美之间近三十年来争夺近东势力范围的斗争的每一个回合，都使“英国所占的中东石油资源的份额减少一些”。
    谈到英国向美国购买石油的计划时，许多报纸评论员都指出，这将引起英国黄金和美元储备的枯竭，并且将削弱英国的经济地位。甚至英国某些右翼政界人士也不满意这个计划。保守党议员威廉斯11月30日在诺丁汉群众集会上演说时指出，“由于苏伊士运河的目前局势，英国只好购买美国石油，这样就需要大量美元，可是英国美元本来已经够少的了。”
    另外一些报纸还指出，即使美国供应石油，也解救不了英国的石油危机。
