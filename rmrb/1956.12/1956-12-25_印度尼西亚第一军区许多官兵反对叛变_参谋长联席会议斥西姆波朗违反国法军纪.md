Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 24th: According to today's newspapers, many officers and soldiers in the First Military District disagree with the coup launched by Simbolon. Major Garu, the commander of the First Infantry Regiment, and Lieutenant Colonel Wahab Makmur, the commander of the Second Infantry Regiment, who were originally under Simbolon's command, have stated that they will continue to support the central government and do not approve of Simbolon's actions. The Jambi authorities also do not approve of the "Banteng" (Wild Buffalo) Division's coup.

According to "Independent News," Simbolon is scheduled to meet today with Daud Beureueh, the leader of the "Indonesian Islamic Army" in the Aceh region.

The Indonesian Cabinet decided on the 22nd to temporarily remove Simbolon from his post, and his position will be taken over by Lieutenant Colonel Djamin Ginting. If the latter is unable to take over due to circumstances, this task will be carried out by Wahab Makmur, the commander of the Second Infantry Regiment.

Today's newspaper reports point out that the actions of the "Banteng" Division in Central Sumatra and Simbolon's actions in North Sumatra are very different. After the "Banteng" Division veterans "took over" the political power in Central Sumatra, they sent people to the capital Jakarta to contact the central government. Transportation between Jakarta and Padang and Bukittinggi remains normal. However, North Sumatra has cut off transportation links.

"Independent News" also reported that the Joint Chiefs of Staff have decided to take resolute action to deal with the riots in North Sumatra.

Simbolon's actions continue to be criticized by public opinion in the capital. However, "Kompas" and "Great Indonesia Daily" do not approve of the government taking resolute measures against Simbolon. According to "Indonesia News," some political figures have asked Hatta to come out and "mediate." This opinion may be raised in the cabinet, and some people have consulted with Hatta on this matter.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 24th: The Indonesian Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a statement today saying that the actions of Simbolon, commander of the First Military District, in breaking away from the central government are not in accordance with national and military principles.

The announcement was signed by the chiefs of staff of the Indonesian Army, Navy, and Air Force.

The announcement stated that the armed forces have a responsibility to improve the national situation, but they must abide by military discipline, and the armed forces cannot be shaken by any political situation.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff believe that the current situation of the armed forces and the country is a test for Indonesian soldiers, to see to what extent everyone can continue to adhere to the five principles of the Indonesian nation (namely, belief in God, nationalism, humanitarianism, social justice, and democracy) and to what extent soldiers understand them.

    印度尼西亚第一军区许多官兵反对叛变
    参谋长联席会议斥西姆波朗违反国法军纪
    新华社雅加达24日电　据今天报纸报道，第一军区有许多官兵不同意西姆波朗发动的政变。原属西姆波朗指挥的第一步兵团团长加鲁少校和第二步兵团团长瓦哈布·马克慕尔中校已经表示要继续支持中央政府，而不赞成西姆波朗的行为。占碑当局也不赞成雄牛师的政变。
    据“独立报”报道，西姆波朗预定在今天同亚齐地区的“印度尼西亚伊斯兰军”首领多德·贝鲁会晤。
    印度尼西亚内阁已经在22日决定把西姆波朗暂时免职，他的职务将由贾明·京廷中校接管。如后者因环境关系不能接管，这项任务将由第二步兵团长瓦哈布·马克慕尔来执行。
    今天报纸消息指出，雄牛师在中苏门答腊的作法和西姆波朗在北苏门答腊的作法有许多不同。雄牛师退伍军人在“接收”中苏门答腊政权后还派人到首都雅加达和中央政府联系。雅加达和巴东、武吉丁宜的交通还保持正常。但是，北苏门答腊地区却断绝了交通联系。
    “独立报”还报道说，参谋长联席会议已经决定以坚决行动来对付北苏门答腊的暴动行为。
    西姆波朗的行为继续受到首都舆论的指责。但是，“指南针报”和“大印度尼西亚报”不赞成政府对西姆波朗采取坚决措施。另据“印度尼西亚新闻”消息，有些政界人士要求哈达出来“调停”，这个意见可能在内阁中被提出，并且有人已就这件事情和哈达磋商。
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚参谋长联席会议今天发表公告说，第一军区司令西姆波朗脱离中央政府的行动，是不符合国家和军事原则的。
    签署这个公告的是印度尼西亚陆、海、空三军的参谋长。
    公告说，武装部队有责任改善国家情况，但是，必须遵守军纪，武装部队不能为任何政治情况所动摇。
    参谋长联席会议认为目前的武装部队和国家的情势是对印度尼西亚军人的一种考验，看大家能继续坚持印度尼西亚建国五基（即神道、民族主义、人道主义、社会公道和民主）和军人认识到何种程度。
