Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 10th: According to TASS, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti delivered a report on the first item on the agenda (“Strive for Italy's path to socialism, for a democratic government of the working class”) at the party's eighth congress.

Togliatti began with a detailed analysis of the current international situation. He said that after a long period of "Cold War" and many extremely dangerous moments with the potential for universal war, international tensions have begun to ease somewhat. However, this does not and cannot mean that imperialism and its Social Democratic lackeys have changed their nature; it remains an aggressive, perfidious, and hostile force against peace. It may put on a charming disguise, but this does not change its nature. Much effort is still needed to consolidate the trend of easing international tensions.

The Aggression Against Egypt Shows Imperialism Fiercely Resisting the Relaxation of International Tensions

Togliatti pointed out the changes in the international situation, the deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, and the disintegration of the colonial system. He said that the Suez crisis was the result of imperialism's frantic search for a way out.

He continued, saying that the bandit-like aggression against the Egyptian people not only reflects the predatory nature of British and French capitalists and their vain attempt to save their colonial status and their prestige as declining imperialist countries by enslaving Egypt. It also shows that these countries and the most reactionary groups in the imperialist world are fiercely resisting the relaxation of international tensions and attempting to restore the Cold War. They hope that, in this situation, the contradictions between imperialists will be easier to overcome, and they will be able to more easily prevent the great process of world change. This process has now developed very far and has become a great threat to them.

The Failure of the Counter-Revolutionary Riot in Hungary Proves the Power of the Forces of Peace

Togliatti reminded everyone to pay attention to the fact that the reactionary forces in several Western countries are on the rise. The banning of the German Communist Party and the attacks on the French Communist Party by fascist bandits are manifestations of this. The reactionary wave is also impacting Italian communists. Togliatti pointed out the role played by the Social Democrats in the current situation. He said, weren't the French Social Democrats the open culprits in the aggression against the Egyptian people? Isn't the French Social Democratic government the organizer of the despicable massacre of Algerian patriots? Look at the Italian Social Democrats, they called for "Atlantic solidarity" to restore the "Cold War," to resume the struggle against the socialist world, and to oppose the liberation of colonial peoples, even earlier than other ruling parties.

Togliatti emphasized that the forces of peace are now strong, and the current world situation makes it possible to avoid war. He said that the entire course of events, especially the failure of the counter-revolutionary riot in Hungary, on which the imperialists pinned their hopes, confirms this.

A Summit Conference of Great Powers Should Be Held to Resolve Issues of Decisive Significance for the Fate of All Mankind

Togliatti advocated holding a summit conference of great powers to resolve a series of issues of decisive significance for the fate of all mankind.

Togliatti said that the cause of easing tensions and striving for peace depends not only on the governments of various countries but also on the people of all countries. The working class should lead the struggle to save world peace, and among the workers, the communists should lead this struggle even more.

Subsequently, Togliatti spoke about the historic resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He said that for the world communist and workers' movement, and especially for us communists as the conscious vanguard of this movement, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, due to its establishment of new directions of development, is the most important event in recent times. Togliatti believed that confirming the existence of the world socialist system and eliminating the consequences of the cult of personality were the most important decisions of the congress.

The Communist Movement Should Be United Not Only Nationally but Also Internationally

Togliatti continued, saying that internationalism is a basic obligation of the workers' movement, and internationalism should be reflected not only in the unity between parties that are still fighting for the seizure of power but also in effective political unity with those parties that have already seized power and are governing the country. The communist movement should be united not only nationally but also internationally.

Togliatti especially talked about the role and position of the Soviet Union in the international communist movement. He emphasized that the Soviet Union and the party that leads it are the pillar and main force of the socialist world, and this position is a reality determined by history. This cannot be erased.

The Task of the Socialist Revolution is to Carry Out a Fundamental and Thorough Economic Transformation in Italy

Togliatti then analyzed Italy's economic and social situation. He pointed out that the living and working conditions of the Italian working people are constantly deteriorating, with about two million people completely unemployed in the country, and just as many working people only partially employed.

Togliatti said that the task of the socialist revolution is to carry out a fundamental and thorough economic transformation in Italy. The current task is to strive to improve the lives of residents, strive to implement universal land reform, and strive to weaken the power of large monopoly capital groups.

Togliatti then pointed out that it is necessary to oppose the reactionary bourgeoisie's attempts to restrict and abolish the political freedoms and democratic rights of the working people, and strive for full compliance with and realization of the current Republican Constitution, in order to pave the way for future reforms.

The Struggle Should Be Led by the Working Class Led by the Revolutionary Vanguard of the Working Class

He said that pointing out the prospect of evolving to socialism through democratic means does not negate the necessity of tenacious struggle. The form of struggle must be determined according to the circumstances; this struggle should be led by the working class led by the revolutionary vanguard of the working class. In the process of struggle, the movement towards socialism should gradually include more and more social strata; this struggle should increasingly strengthen the socialist consciousness of the working class and all the people.

He said that the Italian Communist Party will, as before, dedicate itself to contact, coordination, and cooperation with the Catholic working masses.

He talked about the relationship between the Communist Party and the Italian Socialist Party, saying: Since our two parties are pursuing the same basic goals and acting with the same methods of democratic struggle, our cooperation even goes beyond the scope of the signed agreements and has this form of a decisive political and class movement. However, this by no means excludes independent activities and mutual fraternal criticism; on the contrary, they are indispensable conditions.

Togliatti pointed out that the Communist Party believes that protecting unity and fighting against the ideology and policies of the right-leaning Social Democrats is in its common interest with the Socialist Party.

He continued, saying that while protecting and strengthening its own unity, the working class cannot isolate itself from other democratic and progressive forces. On the contrary, it is creating favorable conditions for contacting and cooperating with them, because the working class can not only wage a victorious struggle for its own immediate interests but also wage a victorious struggle for a common program of renewal. Only in this way can favorable conditions be created for the working class and the working people to participate in leading the work of the government and the state, and for the working class and the working people to become the ruling force as a matter of course. The slogan of establishing a democratic government of all working classes put forward at our congress this time starts from this point, and its meaning is this.

The Democratic Government of the Working Class Should Be a Government That Advocates Peace, Defends Italy's Independence, and Opens the Way for Socialist Innovation

Togliatti pointed out that the democratic government of the working class should be a government that advocates peace and eases international and domestic tensions, a government that tirelessly defends Italy's independence. It should be such a government: it must thoroughly implement and protect the Constitution, it must restore trade union freedom and restore respect for the dignity of workers in the workplace, implement universal agricultural reform, eliminate unemployment, conduct a broad struggle against poverty, end all forms of discrimination, and subject large private industrial and financial monopolists to supervision within the scope of political democracy, abolishing their current rule. It should be such a government, which should rely on the broad mass organizations of workers, peasants, artisans, clerks, youth, and all laborers. It should be such a government, which unites confident working people, the helpless, the oppressed, and the poor around it. It should be such a government, which will implement the Republican Constitution and open a path for the socialist innovation of Italian society.

The Communist Party Can Lead the Working Class and All the Italian People to Build Democracy and Socialism

In the last part of his report, Togliatti talked about the problems within the party. He said that we are a revolutionary party established for action and struggle. We are the party of the classes that are currently exploited and oppressed, and this class needs a consolidated, strong, and united leadership for its own liberation. We are such a party, which will solve the increasingly broad tasks that constantly emerge as the movement develops. To this end, we should have an increasingly effective organization, and we should rely on skilled and capable revolutionary activists and cadres to maintain such an organization.

Togliatti concluded by saying that the socialist world is constantly advancing. The banner of freedom, social progress, and peace is in reliable hands. Our party is moving forward along the path it has defined. For many years, we have worked faithfully and tenaciously for this purpose, and we are proud that we have built the Communist Party and we have shouldered the tasks put forward by history. We are convinced that this party, born from the ranks of the working class, can lead the working class and all the Italian people along the path of victory in building a democratic and socialist society.

    为意大利走向社会主义的道路、为劳动阶级的民主政府而奋斗
    陶里亚蒂在意共第八次代表大会上的报告
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社罗马10日讯：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在党的第八次代表大会上就第一项议程（“为意大利走向社会主义的道路、为劳动阶级的民主政府而奋斗”）作了报告。
    陶里亚蒂首先对目前国际形势作了详细的分析。他说，经过长期的“冷战”和多次有爆发普遍战争的极端危险的时刻之后，国际紧张局势开始有了某些缓和。但是这并不表明，也不能表明帝国主义和它的社会民主党的仆从们改变了自己的性质，它仍然是侵略性的，背信弃义的，敌视和平的力量的。它可以披上迷人的外衣，但是这改变不了它这种性质。为了巩固国际紧张局势缓和的趋势，还需要作很多努力。
    对埃及的侵略表明帝国主义激烈抗拒国际局势的缓和
    陶里亚蒂指出了国际局势的变化、资本主义总危机的加深以及殖民主义体系的瓦解。他说，苏伊士危机是帝国主义疯狂地寻找出路的结果。
    他接着说，对埃及人民的强盗式的侵略，不仅反映出英法资本家的强盗本性，以及英法徒然想靠奴役埃及来挽救自己的殖民主义地位和自己作为衰亡中的帝国主义国家的威信。它还表明，这些国家和帝国主义世界最反动的集团激烈地抗拒国际紧张局势的缓和，并且企图恢复冷战。它们希望，在这种情况下，帝国主义者之间的矛盾就会比较容易克服，它们就能比较轻易地阻止世界伟大的变革进程。这种进程现在已向前发展得很远，已经成为对它们的很大的威胁。
    匈牙利反革命暴动的失败证明了和平力量是强大的
    陶里亚蒂提醒大家注意若干西方国家的反动势力气焰增长的事实，德国共产党被取缔、法国共产党被法西斯匪徒攻击的事件都是这方面的表现。反动浪潮也朝着意大利共产党人冲击。陶里亚蒂指出了社会民主党人在当前局势中所起的作用。他说，法国社会民主党人不正是侵略埃及人民的公开的罪魁吗？法国社会民主党的政府不正是对阿尔及利亚爱国者进行卑鄙屠杀的组织者吗？再看看意大利社会民主党，他们为了恢复“冷战”，恢复同社会主义世界的斗争以及为了反对殖民地人民的解放而号召“大西洋团结”，而且比其他执政党还喊得早。
    陶里亚蒂着重指出，和平力量现在是强大的，世界目前的形势使得战争能够避免。他说，事件的整个进程，特别是帝国主义者寄予厚望的匈牙利反革命暴动的失败都证实了这一点。
    应该召开大国首脑会议解决对全人类命运有决定性意义的问题
    陶里亚蒂主张召开大国首脑会议来解决对全人类命运具有决定性意义的一系列问题。
    陶里亚蒂说，缓和紧张局势和争取和平的事业不仅取决于各国政府，而且还取决于各国人民。工人阶级应当领导拯救世界和平的斗争，而工人当中又以共产党员更应当领导这个斗争。
    随后，陶里亚蒂谈到了苏联共产党第二十次代表大会具有历史意义的决议。他说，对世界共产主义工人运动来说，特别是对我们作为这个运动的自觉的先锋队的共产党员来说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，由于它确立了新的发展方向，是最近时期里一件最重要的事件。陶里亚蒂认为，确认世界社会主义体系的存在和消除个人崇拜的后果是代表大会最重要的决定。
    共产主义运动不仅应在全国范围内而且应在国际间团结一致
    陶里亚蒂接着说，国际主义是工人运动的基本义务，国际主义应当不仅表现在尚在进行夺取政权的斗争的政党之间的团结，而且还表现在同已经取得政权、正在治理国家的那些政党在政治上的有效团结上。共产主义运动不仅应当在全国范围内，而且应当在国际间团结一致。
    陶里亚蒂特别谈到苏联在国际共产主义运动中的作用和地位。他着重指出，苏联和领导它的党是社会主义世界的支柱和主要力量，这种地位是由历史决定的现实。这是不容抹煞的。
    社会主义革命的任务是在意大利实行根本的、彻底的经济改造
    陶里亚蒂接着分析意大利的经济和社会情况。他指出，意大利劳动人民群众的生活和劳动条件不断恶化，国内约有两百万人完全失业，还有同样多的劳动人民只能部分工作。
    陶里亚蒂说，社会主义革命的任务是在意大利实行根本的、彻底的经济改造。而当前的任务就是争取改善居民的生活，争取实行普遍的土地改革，争取削弱大垄断资本集团的权力。
    陶里亚蒂接着指出，必须反对反动资产阶级企图限制和取消劳动人民的政治自由和民主权利，争取充分遵守和实现现在的共和国宪法，以便为以后的改革开辟道路。
    斗争应当由工人阶级的革命先锋队领导的工人阶级来率领
    他说，指出通过民主方式演进到社会主义的前途，并不是否定顽强斗争的必要性。斗争的形式必须根据情况而决定；这种斗争应当由工人阶级的革命先锋队领导的工人阶级来率领，在斗争的过程中，向社会主义前进的运动应当逐步包括越来越多的社会阶层；这种斗争应当愈益加强工人阶级和全体人民的社会主义觉悟。
    他说，意大利共产党将和以前一样致力于同天主教劳动群众的接触、协调和合作。
    他谈到共产党和意大利社会党之间的关系时说：既然我们两党追求着同样的基本目标，并且用一样的民主斗争的方法行动，所以我们的合作甚至超乎签订的协约范围之外，而具有决定性的政治的和阶级的运动的这种形式。但是这绝不排除独立活动和相互进行兄弟式的批评，恰恰相反，它们是不可缺少的条件。
    陶里亚蒂指出，共产党认为，保护团结和对右倾的社会民主党人的思想意识和政策进行斗争是自己同社会党的共同利益。
    他接着说，工人阶级一方面保护和加强自己的团结，一方面也不能同其他的民主力量和进步力量隔绝。相反的，它在为同他们进行接触和合作创造良好的条件，因为工人阶级不仅能够为自己的切身利益进行胜利的斗争，而且能够为共同的革新纲领进行胜利的斗争。只有这样才能创造有利的条件，使工人阶级和劳动人民参加领导政府、国家的工作，使工人阶级和劳动人民成为理所当然的统治力量。我们这一次代表大会上提出的成立各劳动阶级的民主政府的口号，它的出发点就是这样，它的意义也就是这样。
    劳动阶级的民主政府应该是一个主张和平、保卫意大利独立、为社会主义革新打开道路的政府
    陶里亚蒂指出，劳动阶级的民主政府应该是一个主张和平、缓和国际和国内紧张局势的政府，是一个不倦地保卫意大利独立的政府。它应该是这样一个政府：它要彻底实现和保护宪法，它要恢复工会自由和恢复对工作岗位上的劳动者人格的尊重，要实行普遍的农业改革，要消灭失业现象，要对贫困作广泛的斗争，要结束各种形式的歧视，要在政治民主的范围内使大私人工业和财政垄断资本家服从监督，取消他们目前的统治。它应当是这样一个政府，这个政府要依赖工人、农民、手工业者、职员、青年和所有劳动者的广大群众组织。它应当是这样一个政府，这个政府使充满信心的劳动人民、颠沛无告的人、遭受压迫的人和穷人团结在它的周围。它应当是这样一个政府，这个政府将实现共和国宪法，为意大利社会的社会主义革新打开一条道路。
    共产党能够领导工人阶级和全体意大利人民建设民主和社会主义
    陶里亚蒂在报告的最后一部分谈到党内的问题。他说，我们是一个为行动和斗争而建立的革命党。我们是目前遭到剥削和压迫的阶级的党，这个阶级为了自己的解放需要有一个巩固、有力和团结一致的领导。我们是这样的党，这个党随着运动的发展将解决不断出现的日益广泛的任务。为此，我们应当有越来越有效的组织，我们应当依靠干练的、有能力的革命积极分子干部来保持这样的组织。
    陶里亚蒂最后说，社会主义世界不断前进。自由、社会进步和和平的旗帜掌握在可靠的手中。我们的党沿着它所规定的道路前进。许多年来我们为了这种目的而忠诚地、顽强地劳动，我们感到自豪的是：我们缔造了共产党，我们担负了历史所提出的任务。我们确信：从工人阶级队伍里产生出来的这个党，能够领导工人阶级和全体意大利人民沿着胜利建设民主和社会主义社会的道路前进。
