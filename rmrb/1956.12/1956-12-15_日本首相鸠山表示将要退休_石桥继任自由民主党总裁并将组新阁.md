Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 14th: Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) convened an extraordinary convention today and elected incumbent Minister of International Trade and Industry Tanzan Ishibashi as the new president of the LDP.

Incumbent LDP President Ichiro Hatoyama announced at the convention that he would resign from the presidency and would soon resign from his position as Prime Minister. Hatoyama is retiring amidst the increasingly strong calls from the Japanese people for the thorough implementation of an independent policy and the intensifying factional strife within the ruling party. The pro-American opposition faction within the party attacked his policy of restoring diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and demanded his retirement. Party leaders, in order to avoid a split in the ruling party, also advocated for the retirement of Hatoyama, whose health was failing. After two rounds of voting, Tanzan Ishibashi was elected with a majority of votes.

Tanzan Ishibashi will form a new cabinet after Ichiro Hatoyama resigns from the position of Prime Minister. Ishibashi previously served as Minister of Finance in the first Yoshida Cabinet after the war, and he is known for opposing the financial "tightening policy" of the United States and the Yoshida group. He advocates expanding Japan's trade with China and other socialist countries.

Ishibashi said at a press conference after the convention that he would strive to promote the policies of the Hatoyama cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party in the future. A declaration issued by the LDP convention stated that the LDP would "reform" its domestic and foreign policies. It will strengthen cooperation with the United States and other "free country groups" based on the international justice and international peace ideals of the United Nations, and further enhance cooperation with Asian countries in economic, technical, and cultural aspects to maintain peace in East Asia and develop trade.

Ishibashi also said that in the international arena, he would consult with the United States on various issues in the future to seek mutual understanding and thus adjust Japan-US relations; and he intends to promote Japan-Soviet and Japan-China trade more forcefully than now. He said, however, that restoring Japan-China diplomatic relations is a very difficult issue.

Ishibashi said he currently does not intend to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general election.

The Socialist Party of Japan submitted a motion to the House of Representatives yesterday demanding the dissolution of the House. The reason is that the Hatoyama cabinet and the ruling party have lost their ability to govern. In order to change the pro-American foreign policy of the conservative party cabinet, implement an independent and neutral foreign policy, and make domestic politics new, the House of Representatives should be dissolved and the trust of the people should be sought through a general election. The Socialist Party's proposal was rejected by the majority of the Liberal Democratic Party in the House of Representatives.

    日本首相鸠山表示将要退休
    石桥继任自由民主党总裁并将组新阁
    据新华社14日讯　东京消息：日本执政的自由民主党今天召开临时大会，选出现任通商产业相石桥湛山为自由民主党的新总裁。
    现任自由民主党总裁鸠山一郎在大会上宣布他辞去总裁职位，并且要在最近辞去内阁首相职位。鸠山是在日本人民要求贯彻执行独立政策的呼声愈来愈强烈和执政党内部派系斗争日益尖锐的情形下退休的。党内亲美的反对派攻击他同苏联恢复邦交的政策，要求他退休；党内首脑们为了避免执政党的分裂也主张健康情况不佳的鸠山退休。经过两次投票的结果，石桥湛山以多数票当选。
    石桥湛山将在鸠山一郎辞去首相职位以后，组织新的内阁。石桥在战后曾经出任第一次吉田内阁的藏相（财政大臣），他以反对美国和吉田集团的财政“紧缩政策”出名。他主张扩大日本同中国和其他社会主义国家的贸易。
    石桥在大会结束后在记者招待会上说，他今后要努力推行鸠山内阁和自由民主党的政策。自由民主党大会发表的宣言说，自由民主党要“革新”对内和对外各项政策。它要根据联合国的国际正义和国际和平的理想，加强同美国等“自由国家集团”的合作，进而增进同亚洲各国的经济、技术和文化等各个方面的合作关系，维持东亚的和平来发展贸易。
    石桥又说，在国际方面，今后将就各种问题同美国进行磋商，以期彼此了解，从而调整日美关系；并且打算比现在还要强有力地推进日苏、日中贸易。他说，不过，恢复日中邦交是非常困难的问题。
    石桥表示他目前不打算解散众议院举行大选。
    日本社会党在昨天曾向众议院提出要求解散众议院的议案。理由是，鸠山内阁和执政党已经失掉执政能力，为了改变保守政党内阁的依附美国的外交，实行自主中立的外交政策，并且使国内政治焕然一新，应该解散众议院，通过大选来征询国民的信任。社会党的这个提案在众议院遭到了自由民主党的多数否决。
