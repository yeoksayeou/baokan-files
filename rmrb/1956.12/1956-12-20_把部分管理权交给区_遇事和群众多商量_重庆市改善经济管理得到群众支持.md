Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 18th: A Xinhua News Agency reporter in Chongqing reports: Since Chongqing's leading organs began delegating management authority over pork retail, vegetables, chicken, duck, fish, eggs, and other non-staple foods, as well as handicrafts, to the district level in October, they have achieved preliminary results in improving the management of the people's economic lives. Currently, Chongqing's relevant leading departments are further researching and summarizing experiences in this area, preparing to entrust the management of the catering industry, service industries, and a large number of husband-and-wife shops and vendors to the districts as well.

Commercial and handicraft industries are closely related to the people's daily lives and are highly decentralized and regional in nature. A significant benefit of entrusting these tasks to district-level leading organs is that policies and measures are more likely to gain public support, and problem-solving becomes more convenient and timely. For example, rushing to produce 100,000 cotton-padded coats before winter was once a difficult task for Chongqing's relevant leading departments. However, after the task was assigned to the districts, Party, government, mass organizations, and street organizations at all levels held meetings to implement it earnestly. Groups of female residents and family members of workers voluntarily went to sewing production cooperatives to help sew the coats, and a large number of them quickly appeared on the market. Another example is the problem that citizens had long felt that there were too few retail outlets for pork and other items. In the past, the Chongqing State-owned Food Company could not solve this because it could not find suitable premises for new stores. Later, the district assigned this problem to the street offices and convened meetings of mass activists to discuss it. Some helped find vacant houses, and some residents voluntarily vacated surplus houses, quickly resolving the problem. After Chongqing opened the free market for chicken, duck, fish, and eggs, hundreds of unlicensed vendors appeared throughout the city, taking the opportunity to raise prices and affecting market prices. The Shizhong District convened meetings of vendors and inn service personnel, mobilizing activists to publicize and supervise the vendors, playing a significant role in assisting relevant departments in strengthening market management.

When implementing various economic measures, district and street leading organizations mostly convened meetings of grassroots cadres and mass activists beforehand to repeatedly study and strive to make things convenient for the masses. Shizhong District, the most populous district, has an average of more than 3,000 women giving birth each month. The district treated this as an important issue, allocating a batch of pork each month to take care of postpartum women. Some districts have a higher number of people returning from organs and factories on weekends, so street offices convened residents' committees to discuss it. Residents themselves proposed that those who eat at home could reduce the supply of pork and other non-staple foods on holidays, allowing those returning for the weekend to buy more and improve their lives.

In the past, many things were handled exclusively by one business system. Some things that needed to be solved through decentralized methods were also subject to unified regulations, making it difficult for lower levels to implement them. Now that they are entrusted to the districts for management, allowing the masses to come up with ideas, things go much more smoothly, and it is also easier to identify problems. For example, after the opening of the free market, the district collected a large number of opinions within ten days. Because the district-level leading organs had the authority to handle them, most problems were quickly resolved.

After many complex and specific affairs were delegated to the districts, the documents, reports, and meetings of Chongqing's city-level leading departments have begun to decrease. The meetings of the Municipal Third Commercial Bureau alone have been reduced by half. After the Chongqing Food Company entrusted the extremely complex supply tasks to the districts for management, it abolished its original supply departments and concentrated its personnel on organizing sources of goods. The procurement area has expanded from more than 30 counties before September to more than 50 counties, so that the volume of pork and other goods since November has exceeded any month this year.

After each district took charge, the enthusiasm of the district-level leading organs was further enhanced, and the management and guidance of the people's economic life problems gradually strengthened. Recently, most district committees of the Chinese Communist Party have held serious discussions on issues related to the people's economic life; the secretary of the Shizhong District personally went to the grassroots to investigate and research the transformation of handicrafts and other issues; some districts have also specifically designated a leader to manage this aspect of work.

After the delegation of handicrafts and some commercial work to the districts, the current problem is that the coordination and cooperation between Chongqing's districts has been weakened. For example, market management and price control vary from district to district, with some being lax and some being strict. The price of chicken, duck, fish, and eggs in the suburbs is already higher than in the city, which is unreasonable. The standards for meat distribution are also different in each district of the same city, causing complaints from the masses. Therefore, although city-level relevant leading organs interfere less in the specific work of the districts, unified leadership should not be weakened as a result and should be strengthened, and attention should be paid to solving the problem of cooperation between the districts.

### 把部分管理权交给区　遇事和群众多商量  重庆市改善经济管理得到群众支持

    把部分管理权交给区　遇事和群众多商量
    重庆市改善经济管理得到群众支持
    新华社重庆18日电　新华社驻重庆记者报道：重庆市的领导机关，自从今年10月份开始把猪肉零售、蔬菜、鸡鸭鱼蛋等副食品和手工业的管理权陆续下放到区一级以后，在改善人民经济生活的管理工作方面，已收到初步效果。目前，重庆市有关领导部门正在进一步研究，总结这方面的经验。准备把饮食业、服务性行业和为数很大的夫妻商店、摊贩等也交区管理。
    商业和手工业行业与人民日常生活关系很密切，且带有很大的分散性、地区性，把这些工作交区一级领导机关管理后显著的好处，是政策措施容易得到群众的支持，解决问题更加方便和及时。例如入冬以后赶制十万件棉衣，当时成为重庆市有关领导部门最感困难的事情，但是任务分配到区以后，各区党、政、群众团体和街道组织，都分别开会，认真贯彻。一批又一批的居民妇女、职工家属自动到缝纫生产合作社帮助缝制，几天之内大批棉衣就应市了。再如市民一直感到猪肉等零售点太少的问题，过去重庆市国营食品公司因找不到设门市的房子，不好解决，后由区把这个问题布置到街道办事处，并且召集群众积极分子开会商量，有的帮助找出了空房子，有的居民自愿腾出了多余的房子，这样很快就把这个问题解决了。重庆的鸡鸭鱼蛋自由市场开放以后，全市出现了几百个没有执照的商贩，他们乘机抬价，影响物价。市中区召集商贩和旅栈服务人员等开了会，动员积极分子对商贩进行宣传和监督，对协助有关部门加强市场管理起了很大作用。
    区、街的领导机构在贯彻各种经济措施时，大都事先召集基层干部和群众积极分子开会，反复研究，尽可能做到便利群众。人口最多的市中区，平均每月有三千多个妇女生孩子。区里便把这件事当作一个重要问题来处理，每月拨出一批猪肉照顾产妇。有些地区从机关、厂矿回来过星期天的人较多，街道办事处就召集居民委员研究，居民自己提出住家吃饭的人在假日可以减少猪肉等副食品的供应，让回来过星期天的人多买，改善他们的生活。
    过去有许多事都由一个业务系统包揽，有些需要用分散办法解决的，也作统一规定，下面不易贯彻。现在交给区里管理，让群众出主意，事情就顺利得多，同时也便于发现问题。例如自由市场开放后，在十天之内区就收集了大量的意见。由于区一级领导机关有权处理，问题大都得到迅速处理。
    许多庞杂的具体事务交区分管以后，重庆市一级有关领导部门文件、表报、会议已开始减少。仅市第三商业局的会议就减少一半。重庆市食品公司在极复杂的供应任务交区管理以后，已撤销原来的供应部门，将人员集中到组织货源方面去，采购区域已由9月份以前的三十多县扩大到五十多县，使11月以来猪肉等的来货量超过今年任何一个月。
    各区分管之后，区一级领导机关的积极性更加发挥了，对人民经济生活问题的管理和指导逐步加强了。最近多数区的中共区委员会都对有关人民经济生活的问题作了认真讨论；市中区书记，亲自到基层调查研究手工业改造等问题；有的区还专门指定一位领导人管理这方面的工作。
    手工业和一部分商业工作交区分管后，目前存在的问题，是重庆市区与区之间的协作、配合有所削弱。例如市场管理、价格掌握，各区有松有紧，市郊鸡鸭鱼蛋的价格已高过市区，这是不合理的。肉类的分配同一个市各区标准也不相同，群众有意见。因此，市一级有关领导机关具体工作虽然对区少干涉，但是统一领导不能因此削弱，还应当加强，并且注意解决各区之间的协作问题。
