　　Recent Situation of Xiao Hong's Tomb
    Chen Fan
　　Year after year, I watch the spring bloom by the sea,
　　Each time, I pause with my staff by the lonely grave.
　　Dreams of the Black Water and White Mountains fade,
　　A lone branch and fragrant grass, old feelings now void.
　　The vast waves do not carry returning sails,
　　Can wisdom's bones be sealed away by layers of filth?
　　The "Field of Life and Death" becomes a place of ease,
　　Should there be no space for Xiao Hong to reside!

　　The female writer Xiao Hong passed away in Hong Kong after the outbreak of the Pacific War. Amidst the chaos of war, she was hastily buried at the head of Repulse Bay. The area faces the sea and is planted with flame trees, whose dense spring blossoms burst forth like a fiery blaze, with lush green foliage providing ample shade, truly a "flower lane." Every time I go to Repulse Bay, I make sure to visit Xiao Hong's tomb. The natural environment there is not bad, but because she was buried hastily back then, there is neither a stele nor a raised mound, only a concrete circle. Passersby probably have no idea that the famous Chinese female writer is resting here.

　　In the early post-war period, there was a single tree standing within that circle, about ten feet tall. Although solitary, it possessed a sense of aloofness, often reminding me of the frail Xiao Hong. But when I went to see it three years ago, even that single tree had been cut down, leaving only wild grass. This summer, when I went to see it, the situation was even more disheartening. The burial site had actually been leveled, and a canvas awning was erected on top, serving as a stall for selling soda and food, trampled on daily, covered in dirt and grime. Because Repulse Bay is one of Hong Kong's swimming beaches, many "swim stalls" are set up in this area every year, and consequently, soda and food stalls are everywhere.

　　I feel that allowing the tomb of this famous Chinese female writer to be desecrated here is not how we should show our respect, is it? Therefore, I wrote this poem, hoping that it will at least attract the attention of the literary community and find a way to relocate her remains. The "Field of Life and Death" of those years has now become a prosperous land of national construction, and Xiao Hong should also be brought back to see it, shouldn't she?

### 萧红墓近况

　　萧红墓近况
    陈凡
　　年年海畔看春穠，
　　每过孤坟息旅筇。
　　黑水白山乡梦渺，
　　独柯芳草旧情空。
　　沧波不送归帆去，
　　慧骨长堪积垢封？
　　生死场成安乐地，
　　岂应无隙住萧红！
    女作家萧红在太平洋战争爆发后病逝香港，在兵荒马乱之中，被人草草埋葬在浅水湾头。那地方面临大海，种满了红影树，浓春红花霰发，如火如荼，绿叶浓荫，可说是一条“花巷”。我每次到浅水湾去，总要到萧红墓那里去看看。那里自然环境虽不坏，但因当时草草埋葬，既无碑石，又乏冡阜，只有一个用水泥围筑的圆圈。过往行人，恐怕根本不知道这里长眠着我国的著名女作家。
    战后初期，在那个圆圈中有一株独柯的树，高一丈许，虽然孤单，但亦有清傲之意，看着它，每每令人想起瘦弱的萧红。但三年前我去看时，连这株独柯树也已被人斩去，只剩野草芊芊了。今夏去看，景况更令人不快，那坟地竟被人填平，上面搭了帆布棚，作为卖汽水食物的摊子，天天任人践踏，杂垢遍地。因为浅水湾是香港游泳海滩之一，这一带每年都搭了许多“游水棚”，因而汽水食物摊也就到处都是了。
    我觉得，让这位我国著名的女作家的坟墓在这里受到蹧蹋，总不是我们表示尊重之道吧？所以写了这首诗，希望至少能引起文艺界的注意，设法迁葬。当年的“生死场”，而今已成为祖国建设繁荣之地，也应该接萧红回去看看了吧？
