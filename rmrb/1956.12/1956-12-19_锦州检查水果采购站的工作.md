    Jinzhou Review of Work at the Fruit Purchasing Station
    The situation reported in the "People's Daily" on October 11, which criticized the Jinzhou Fruit Purchasing and Wholesale Station for suppressing grades and prices to seek exorbitant profits, is true. We have already inspected their work and ordered the relevant personnel of the wholesale station to conscientiously examine their business practices, strictly implement the national apple grade standards and pricing policies, and establish a practical and feasible work inspection system.

    锦州检查水果采购站的工作
    10月11日“人民日报”批评锦州水果采购批发站压级压价牟取暴利的情况属实。我们已经对他们的工作进行了检查，责成该批发站有关人员认真检查经营作风，严格执行国家规定的苹果等级标准和价格政策，并且建立切实可行的工作检查制度。
