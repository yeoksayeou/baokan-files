　　From Robber to Beggar
After the failure of Britain's adventurous gamble of invading Egypt, Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan is in trouble. On December 4th, he announced in the quiet and tense House of Commons that the sterling area's reserves had suddenly decreased by 279 million US dollars in November, bringing the total reserves below the "minimum limit necessary to safeguard the value of the pound," causing a crisis of pound devaluation.
What to do? Macmillan announced that "emergency measures" would be taken—including squeezing the pockets of the British people (raising gasoline tariffs), selling off Britain's assets (selling some dollar securities), etc., but these were just a drop in the bucket, of no avail. So he came up with a "major measure": begging from the United States. He hoped that the American creditor would waive the 82.2 million US dollars in interest that Britain should pay on December 31st, and humbly pleaded that if the United States agreed to be generous, Canada would naturally follow suit and make a decision to waive interest payments. In that case, Britain could alleviate a burden of 100.4 million US dollars in total.
A month ago, it was still swaggering to Port Said to show off its might, but in the blink of an eye, it was like a beggar leaning against the door asking for food. This is truly retribution!
The American boss is secretly happy: Britain's begging is a good opportunity for them to further tighten their grip on Britain's neck. The U.S. State Department spokesman announced that day that the United States would "sympathetically consider" Britain's request. From this incident, people can see a principle of the American boss in spending money: when people ask it for loans to build dams and improve people's lives, it rudely refuses; but it is unusually generous to invaders who beg for money to fill the deficit of a sinful war.

　　从强盗到乞儿
    英国侵略埃及的冒险赌博失败之后，财政大臣麦克米伦可倒霉了。12月4日，他在寂静而紧张的下院宣布：11月份英镑区国家的储备金一下子就减少了二亿七千九百万美元，使得总储备金降到了“保障英镑的价值所必要的最低限额”以下，引起了英镑贬值的危机。
    怎么办？麦克米伦宣布要采取“紧急措施”——包括挤英国人民的钱袋（提高汽油关税）、抛售英国的老本（出卖一些美元证券）等等，但这些都是杯水车薪，无济于事，于是想出了一个“主要的措施”：向美国求乞。他希望美国债主放弃英国应在12月31日交纳它的八千二百万美元的利息，并且低声下气地哀求说，如果美国同意慷慨解囊，加拿大将自然而然地跟着作出免付利息的决定。那末，英国一共就可以减轻一亿零四百万美元的负担。
    一个月前还是那么耀武扬威地到塞得港逞凶的强盗，转眼之间就形同倚门求食的乞儿了。这真是活报应！
    美国老板暗自高兴：英国的乞求是他们进一步扼紧英国脖子的好时机。美国国务院发言人当天就宣布，美国将“同情地考虑”英国的要求。人们从这件事情上，可以看出美国老板花钱的一个原则：当人们向它贷款修水坝、改善人民生活的时候，它粗暴地拒绝了；但它对于侵略者乞钱来填补罪恶战争的亏空时，却出乎寻常地慷慨。（基）
