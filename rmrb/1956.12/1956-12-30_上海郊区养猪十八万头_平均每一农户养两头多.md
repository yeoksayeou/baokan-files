    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th -- Shanghai suburbs have raised approximately 180,000 pigs this year, an increase of about 80,000 compared to last year. Currently, each farmer household in the suburbs raises an average of more than two pigs.
    Following the principle of serving the city, Shanghai's suburbs vigorously developed pig farming after the basic realization of agricultural cooperation this spring. Agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs specifically allocated some land to grow various green fodder crops such as barley and carrots, and also made full use of leftovers, bean dregs, and vegetable peels from the city dwellers to feed the pigs. The Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Bureau also trained more than 1,400 breeders and more than 300 epidemic prevention workers for farmers, thus reducing the mortality rate of pigs from 6% last year to 3%.
    This year, there was also a tendency in the suburbs to neglect household pig raising. Starting in June this year, this tendency was corrected, and agricultural cooperatives supplied piglets and feed to cooperative members' families for pig raising, thus restoring household pig raising.

    上海郊区养猪十八万头
    平均每一农户养两头多
    新华社上海26日电　上海市郊区今年共养猪十八万头左右，比去年增加约八万头。现在，郊区每一农户平均养猪两头多。
    上海市郊区根据为城市服务的方针，今春基本上实现农业合作化以后大力发展了养猪事业。郊区各农业社专门拨出一些土地，种植大麦、胡萝卜等各种青饲料，并且充分利用城市人民吃剩下的下脚、豆渣以及菜皮等喂猪。上海市农业局还为农民训练了一千四百多名饲养员和三百多名防疫员，因而猪的死亡率由去年6％降低到3％。
    今年郊区也曾经发生过忽视家庭养猪的偏向，今年6月份开始纠正了这种偏向，各农业社把小猪、饲料供给社员家庭养猪，因而家庭养猪又恢复起来。
