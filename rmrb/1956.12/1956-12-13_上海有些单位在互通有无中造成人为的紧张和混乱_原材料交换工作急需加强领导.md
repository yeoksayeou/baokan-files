Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Zhongni reports: This year, many factories and enterprises in Shanghai have used the method of mutual exchange to overcome the difficulty of insufficient supply of ferrous metals, which has yielded great results. However, recently, some industrial, commercial, and public institutions, in the exchange of mutual exchange, are only willing to carry out "barter" that only benefits their own units, creating some artificial tension and disorder in the material supply work.

In May and October of this year, Shanghai successively conducted two general surveys of inventory materials. Under the unified organization of the material supply department, various industrial departments and enterprises mutually supported the units in need with stagnant or non-urgent materials. According to incomplete statistics after the first adjustment, more than 1,000 tons of steel were uniformly adjusted by the Shanghai Municipal Materials Supply Bureau, and several thousand tons were mutually adjusted by various departments and enterprises. As a result, most enterprises overcame the current difficulties and carried out production normally according to the plan.

In the process of overcoming difficulties through mutual exchange, the departmentalism of some enterprise staff has risen. According to the October inventory survey, the number of stagnant or non-urgent materials that many units reported as available for adjustment has decreased significantly. Some enterprises concealed materials that should have been supplied to higher authorities for unified adjustment and carried out "barter" on their own, and violated the material distribution system in the exchange. For example, the special raw material for manufacturing powder sprayers and atomizers—thin steel plates—allocated by the central government to the Shanghai Municipal Handicraft Bureau, had a lot of surplus because the production task was reduced. The Handicraft Bureau then transferred more than 100 tons of thin steel plates to other departments for other steel products without authorization. On the one hand, they reported to the Shanghai Municipal Materials Supply Bureau that they lacked steel, and on the other hand, they exchanged another batch of about 500 tons of substandard steel allocated by the central government for bamboo with Jiangxi Province. These exchanges did not go through the Materials Supply Bureau.

Some enterprises take advantage of the urgent need of others to carry out unequal exchanges of their own materials. The Supply and Marketing Department of the First Heavy Industry Bureau purchased thin steel plates from the Shanghai Hardware and Machinery Company, and the other party wanted to use small-sized steel and seamless steel pipes to exchange two tons for one ton. The Shanghai Tram Company urgently needed to purchase screws to repair the tracks, but the screw shop also wanted them to exchange round steel, otherwise they would not supply them. This company had to buy newsprint from the Tianjin Paper Mill to print tram tickets, and it only succeeded in exchanging it with teak and steel. Now, it has also been found in Shanghai that some joint state-private hardware stores are unwilling to trade in cash, and they are also disguisedly raising prices and profiting from barter.

Due to this barter and the rise of departmentalism, many disputes have arisen in the production collaboration and ordering relations between enterprises. The Shanghai Bus Repair Factory ordered an electroplating generator urgently needed for basic construction from the joint state-private Qian Yongji Electric Motor Factory. The Bus Repair Factory was willing to supply thin steel plates and bearing processing fees equivalent to the value of the raw materials required for this generator and pay them in cash; Qian Yongji, because of the lack of these two raw materials, insisted on supplying thin steel plates and bearings equivalent to the entire commodity value of this generator (including raw materials, processing fees and profits), and listed various bearings urgently needed for its own production, requiring the other party to purchase and supply them. Due to these unreasonable conditions, the two parties have not been able to sign an agreement until now. Now, many units are searching everywhere for materials that are not needed by their own enterprises in order to carry out such "barter," artificially making the supply of certain materials appear even more tense and disordered.

The Shanghai Municipal Materials Supply Department and relevant leading organs have received many reports on such situations, and many units require strengthening the leadership of raw material mutual exchange, and abiding by the material distribution system; especially the exchange of materials managed by the state plan must be carried out through the material supply authorities to avoid disorder.

### 上海有些单位在互通有无中造成人为的紧张和混乱  原材料交换工作急需加强领导

    上海有些单位在互通有无中造成人为的紧张和混乱
    原材料交换工作急需加强领导
    新华社上海11日电　新华社记者徐中尼报道：上海许多工厂企业今年用互通有无的办法克服黑色金属供应不足的困难，收到很大效果。但是近来有一些工业、商业和事业单位在互通有无的交换中，只肯进行只有利于本单位的“物物交换”；造成物资供应工作中某些人为的紧张和紊乱情况。
    今年5月和10月，上海先后进行了两次库存物资的普查工作，各个工业部门和企业之间，在物资供应部门统一组织下，彼此将呆滞的或不急用的物资支援给需用的单位。据第一次调剂以后的不完全统计，经上海市物资供应局统一调剂的钢材有一千多吨，由各部门和企业相互调剂的也有数千吨，因而使大部分企业克服了当前的困难，正常地按计划进行生产。
    在互通有无克服困难的过程中，有些企业的工作人员本位主义思想抬头了。据10月份的库存普查，许多单位填报的可供调剂的呆滞或不急用的物资数量显著减少。有些企业把应该供上级统一调剂的物资隐瞒起来，自己进行着“物物交换”，并且在交换中违反了物资分配制度。例如中央分配给上海市手工业管理局制造喷粉喷雾器的专用原料——薄钢板，因为生产任务削减了，剩余很多，手工业局便擅自把一百多吨薄钢板向别的部门调换了其他钢材。他们一方面向上海市物资供应局反映缺少钢材，另一方面又把中央分配的另一批约五百吨次货钢材和江西省交换了毛竹。这些交换都没有通过物资供应局。
    有些企业乘人急需用自己的物资进行不等值的交换。第一重工业局供销处向上海市五金机械公司购买薄钢板，对方要以小型型钢、无缝钢管去用两吨换一吨。上海市电车公司因为修理路轨急需要购买螺丝，但螺丝商店也要他们拿元钢去交换，否则不肯供应。这个公司因为要添印电车票向天津造纸厂去买白报纸，也是拿柚木和钢材去交换才成功的。现在，上海还发现有些经营旧五金的公私合营商店也不肯现金交易，并且在物物交换中变相抬高物价，从中取利。
    由于这种物物交换和本位主义思想抬头，企业之间生产协作和订货的关系中发生了不少纠纷。上海客车修理厂向公私合营钱镛记电机制造厂订购一台基本建设急需的电镀发电机，客车修理厂愿意供应相当这台发电机所需原材料价值的薄钢板和轴承加工费用等用现金付给；钱镛记因为缺乏这两项原材料，坚持要供应相当于这台发电机的全部商品价值（包括原材料、加工费用和利润）的薄钢板和轴承，并且开列了各种各样自己生产上急需的轴承，要对方采购供应。由于这种不合理的条件，双方至今无法签订协议。现在有不少单位为了进行这样的“物物交换”，到处搜购并不是本企业需用的物资，人为地使某些物资的供应情况显得更加紧张和紊乱。
    上海的物资供应部门和有关的领导机关已经收到不少有关这类情况的反映，许多单位要求加强对原材料互通有无工作的领导，遵守物资分配制度；特别是国家计划管理的物资的交换，必须通过物资供应主管部门，避免发生紊乱。
