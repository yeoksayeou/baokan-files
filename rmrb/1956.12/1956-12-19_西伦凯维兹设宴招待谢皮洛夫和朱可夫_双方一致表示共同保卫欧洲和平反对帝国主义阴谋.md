Xinhua News Agency, December 18th, Warsaw dispatch: According to TASS, Polish Council of Ministers Chairman Cyrankiewicz hosted a banquet on December 17th in honor of Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov and Soviet Defense Minister, Marshal of the Soviet Union Zhukov, who are visiting Poland.

On the Polish side, other leaders of the Polish United Workers' Party and the government, including Gomulka, attended the banquet.

On the Soviet side, General Antonov and others also attended the banquet.

Cyrankiewicz spoke at the meeting. He said that the treaty signed in Warsaw regarding the legal status of Soviet troops stationed in Poland convincingly proves how much the Soviet government values the implementation of the Soviet government's declaration of October 30th and the joint statement signed by our two countries in Moscow in November this year. Cyrankiewicz believes that this is also an important and convincing example of how relations between socialist countries can and should develop.

Cyrankiewicz said that today, although it has been eleven years since the victory over German imperialist forces, the security of Central Europe, especially Poland and its borders on the Oder and Neisse rivers, has not been guaranteed by a treaty. The Polish government will continue to strive to ensure that the proposition of European collective security triumphs over the conspiracies of aggression and revanchist forces threatening peace, and we are fighting for this proposition together with the Soviet Union. At present, in a situation where there is neither a treaty nor a collective security treaty, but revanchist groups harbor aggressive intentions, the stationing of Soviet troops on the Elbe River is a fundamental guarantee of the security of Poland and the entire peace camp.

Next, Shepilov spoke. He said that the treaty we signed today, which determines the legal status of Soviet troops during their temporary stay in Poland, will be an important milestone in the further development and consolidation of Soviet-Polish friendship. The atmosphere of complete mutual understanding and sincere cooperation during the talks can only exist, and indeed does exist, in the fraternal family of socialist countries that build their relations on the Leninist principles of equality and sovereignty of all nations and advance towards the common goal of communism under the great banner of Marx and Lenin.

Shepilov said that imperialist aggressors are attempting to gain the upper hand in the East – in Egypt. Reactionary forces are trying to exploit the legitimate dissatisfaction of the Hungarian working people with the serious mistakes made by the previous leadership to create counter-revolutionary unrest in the heart of Europe. The reason why the imperialist elements have been working so hard in the past and present is to try to blow up the bulwark of the socialist camp, even if it is only one, in order to undermine the camp's unity. However, the despicable anti-people forces have failed. The imperialist conspirators have suffered a fatal blow, and the cause of peace has thus won. However, the enemy continues to plot. For example, we cannot ignore the fact that the revival of militant militarism in West Germany is a serious and growing threat to the peace-loving countries of Europe and directly to the people of Poland, and that a recent meeting of the aggressive military bloc of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has decided to allow West German militarists to possess atomic weapons.

The peoples of the Soviet Union and Poland are closely concerned with safeguarding peace in Europe and the world. Our two countries have made great efforts to establish a European security system. We will work together with the utmost determination for these great tasks. The army of our glorious Soviet country, together with the brave Polish army, will steadfastly defend the peace and security of all nations.

Shepilov said that friendly Soviet-Polish relations are a clear example of fraternal cooperation between equal socialist countries. The peoples of these countries are inspired by the great ideas of proletarian internationalism, and their code of conduct is a beneficial ancient motto: "One for all, all for one!" We cherish the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and Poland, because the more consolidated the friendship between our two peoples and the friendship between socialist countries, the stronger the socialist family is, and the less the reactionary militarist forces will dare to act recklessly. I would like to wish that the treaty we have signed will further develop and consolidate the fraternal relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, which will benefit our two peoples and universal peace.

Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki and Defense Minister Spychalski extended warm congratulations to the Soviet delegation.

Soviet Defense Minister, Marshal of the Soviet Union Zhukov, also spoke. He said that the Soviet armed forces are pleased with the achievements of the Polish army in their combat and political training. The combat friendship between the Soviet Union and Poland was consolidated on the battlefield against the common enemy of German fascism. This friendship is united by the common bloodshed of the sons of the Soviet and Polish peoples.

Zhukov said that as for the Soviet armed forces, it considers it its greatest honor to carry out the internationalist tasks stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement and the Warsaw Treaty. The Soviet people believe that the combat friendship between the Soviet armed forces and the Polish armed forces will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

    西伦凯维兹设宴招待谢皮洛夫和朱可夫
    双方一致表示共同保卫欧洲和平反对帝国主义阴谋
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社华沙讯：波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹12月17日设宴招待正在波兰访问的苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫和苏联国防部长、苏联元帅朱可夫。
    波兰方面参加宴会的有波兰统一工人党和政府的其他领导人哥穆尔卡等。
    苏联方面参加宴会的还有安东诺夫大将等。
    西伦凯维兹在会上讲了话。他说，在华沙签订的关于留驻在波兰的苏军的法律地位的条约令人信服地证明，苏联政府是如何重视贯彻苏联政府10月30日的宣言和贯彻今年11月间在莫斯科签订的我们两国的联合声明。西伦凯维兹认为，这也是一个重要的、令人信服的例证，说明社会主义国家之间的关系能够而且应该怎样发展。
    西伦凯维兹说，今天，虽然战胜德国帝国主义势力已经有十一年了，但是，中欧，首先是波兰及其在奥得河和尼斯河的边境的安全还没有一个和约来保障。波兰政府今后将致力于使欧洲集体安全的主张战胜威胁着和平的侵略和复仇势力的阴谋，我们正同苏联一道为这一主张而斗争。目前，一方面既没有和约，也没有集体安全条约，而复仇主义集团却抱有侵略企图，在这种局势下，苏联军队驻扎在易北河，是对波兰，也是对整个和平阵营的安全的基本保障。
    接着，谢皮洛夫讲了话。他说，今天我们签订的决定苏联军队在他们暂时留驻波兰期间的法律地位的条约，将是进一步发展和巩固波苏友谊道路上的重要里程碑。会谈时的完全相互谅解、真诚合作的气氛，只有在把关系建立在各国人民平等和享有主权的列宁主义原则上，并且在马克思列宁伟大的旗帜下向共同目标——共产主义胜利前进的社会主义国家的兄弟家庭中才可能存在，而且确实存在。
    谢皮洛夫说，帝国主义侵略者企图在东方——埃及占上风。反动势力企图利用匈牙利劳动人民对以前的领导所犯的严重错误的正当不满来在欧洲中心制造反革命的骚动。帝国主义分子过去和现在所以这样特别卖力气，是图谋炸毁社会主义阵营的堡垒，即使炸毁一个也是好的，以此来破坏这个阵营的团结一致。但是，卑鄙的反人民的势力遭到了失败。帝国主义阴谋分子遭受了致命的打击，和平事业由此获得了胜利。但是，敌人还在继续进行阴谋活动。例如，我们不能忽视这一事实：在西德复活的好战的军国主义就是对欧洲爱好和平的国家和直接对人民波兰的一种严重的日益增长的威胁，北大西洋公约组织这个侵略性的军事集团最近召开的一次会议已决定使西德军国主义者拥有原子武器。
    苏联和波兰两国人民密切关心维护欧洲和世界和平。我们两国为建立欧洲安全体系曾作了很大的努力。我们将以最大决心为这些伟大任务而共同努力。我们光荣的苏维埃国家的军队将和勇敢的波兰军队一起坚定不移地捍卫各国人民的和平和安全。
    谢皮洛夫说，友好的苏波关系是平等的社会主义国家兄弟合作的一个明显例证。这些国家的人民受到伟大的无产阶级国际主义思想的鼓舞，他们的处世准则是一个有益的古老格言：“我为人人，人人为我！”我们珍视苏波两国人民之间的友谊，因为我们两国人民之间的友谊、社会主义国家之间的友谊越巩固，社会主义国家大家庭就越是强大有力，反动军国主义的力量也就被迫越不敢乱动妄为了。我谨祝我们签订的条约将使苏联和波兰之间的兄弟关系得到进一步发展和巩固，而利于我们两国人民，利于普遍和平。
    波兰外交部长拉帕茨基和国防部长斯彼哈尔斯基向苏联代表团致热烈的贺词。
    苏联国防部长、苏联元帅朱可夫也讲了话。他说，苏联武装部队对波兰军队在它们的战斗和政治训练中所获得的成就感到高兴。苏联和波兰的战斗友谊是在反对德国法西斯主义这个共同敌人的战场上巩固起来的。这个友谊是用苏联和波兰人民儿子的共同流血而团结起来的。
    朱可夫说，至于苏联武装部队，它认为执行波茨坦协定和华沙条约规定的国际主义任务是自己最大的荣誉。苏联人民相信，苏军武装部队和波军武装部队之间的战斗友谊，将日益巩固和发展。
