Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 6th. Ninety-seven textile and dyeing factories in Shanghai, whose electricity consumption accounts for more than 40% of the city's total industrial electricity consumption, together with three textile factories in Chuansha and Jiading near Shanghai, signed an inter-factory electricity conservation competition contract on the 5th. The conditions of the competition are to further conserve electricity while ensuring safe production and improving product quality.

Shanghai's textile factories have always paid relatively close attention to saving electricity in the past. Last year, the actual electricity consumption of the city's textile industry saved more than 41 million kilowatt-hours compared with the previous year; from January to October this year, the electricity consumption of the factories under the East China Textile Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry alone saved 12.73 million kilowatt-hours compared with the plan. This electricity can be used to spin 80,000 bales of cotton yarn or weave 110 million meters of cotton cloth.

    上海地区一百个纺织、印染厂
　　开展厂际节约用电竞赛
    新华社上海6日电　用电量占上海全市工业用电40％以上的上海九十七家纺织、印染工厂，同上海附近川沙、嘉定的三家纺织厂一起，5日签订了厂际节约用电竞赛合同。竞赛条件是进一步节约用电，同时保证安全生产和提高产品质量。
    上海的纺织厂过去一向比较注意节约用电。去年全市纺织工业的实际用电量比前年节约四千一百多万度；今年1月到10月份，单是纺织工业部华东纺织管理局所属各厂的用电量，就比计划节约了一千二百七十三万度。用这些电力可以纺八万件棉纱或是织一亿一千万公尺棉布。
