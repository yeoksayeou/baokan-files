    Inspiration
    Recently, the Second Processing Workshop of the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory organized worker representatives to visit the Qinhuai Agricultural Cooperative. They first asked the cooperative's cadres to introduce the cooperative's struggle against natural disasters over the past year and the farmers' living conditions. Then, they went to the fields or villages in groups, helping with labor and chatting casually. In the cordial conversations, many vivid facts inspired the workers. They were deeply moved by the farmers' spirit of "treating the cooperative as their home" and their diligent and thrifty lives. Su Wand, a grinder worker, was touched to see that the farmers couldn't bear to throw away even a small piece of wood and that they saved even seven cents in the bank. Upon his return, he consciously criticized his shortcomings of pursuing quotas at the expense of quality in production and paying attention to "airs" in life. All employees proposed the slogans "Treat the factory as home" and "Run the factory diligently and thriftily."
    If factory propaganda workers unleash their creative spirit, what vivid forms can they find to inspire the masses' consciousness of increasing production and practicing economy!

    启发
    最近，南京机床厂第二加工车间组织工人代表访问了秦淮农业合作社。他们先请社干部介绍了社里一年来跟自然灾害作斗争的情况和农民的生活情况，然后分头到田间或村子里，一边帮助劳动，一边谈家常。在亲切的交谈中，许多生动的事实启发了工人。他们看到农民“以社为家”的精神，和克勤克俭的生活，都十分感动。滚床工苏万德看到农民连块小木头也舍不得丢掉，七分钱都要存进银行，回来自觉地批判了自己在生产上追求定额不顾质量、生活上讲究“派头”的缺点。全体职工都提出了“以厂为家”“勤俭办厂”的行动口号。
    工厂的宣传工作者如果发挥创造精神，可以找到多么生动的形式来启发群众增产节约的自觉性啊！
