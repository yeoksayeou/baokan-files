Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 1st: A meeting of all-Poland social and political activists was held in Warsaw on November 29th. The meeting was convened by the Polish Parliamentary Election Consultative Committee, which includes representatives from various parties and people's organizations, and the Presidium of the All-Poland Committee of the National Front.

　　Attending the meeting were Polish United Workers' Party leaders Gomulka, Zawadzki, and Zambrowski, leaders of the United People's Party and the Democratic Party, as well as representatives from trade unions and other social organizations, totaling three thousand people.

　　The meeting was chaired by Zawadzki, Chairman of the All-Poland Committee of the National Front. He emphasized that the slogan of the meeting was the unity of the Polish nation. He proposed an agenda for the meeting, including speeches by representatives of various political parties and people's organizations, discussions, and the adoption of a letter to the Polish people on election issues.

　　Subsequently, Gomulka delivered a speech on behalf of the United Workers' Party. He spoke about Poland's foreign relations and the domestic situation.

　　Ignar, Chairman of the Central Committee of the United People's Party, then spoke. He said that the principle of the worker-peasant alliance had been distorted in the past, and the conditions for reviving this alliance had now arisen, with the United People's Party able to play an important role. The Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party has already initiated a new era characterized by equality and independence in the relations between the parties. The United People's Party expressed its support for the program of the Polish United Workers' Party during the difficult October period and will execute this program alongside it.

　　Ignar then expressed his belief that it was necessary to hold elections for the People's Assembly in the near future in order to accelerate the process of democratization. He said that in the coming years, individual farmers will continue to be the foundation of agricultural production. However, it is necessary to guarantee assistance and support for agricultural cooperatives established on a completely voluntary basis.

　　Kulczyński, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Democratic Party, spoke about the role of parliament. He said that the most important task of parliament should be to exercise the supreme power of the nation. Therefore, parliament must assume full legislative responsibility and carry out concrete and comprehensive supervision of the work of the government. Parliament must have a clear date for convening meetings, and dates should be stipulated for submitting budgets and economic plans to parliament. Kulczyński said that the Democratic Party had passed a resolution announcing its decision to participate in the elections together with the Polish United Workers' Party, the United People's Party, and social and political organizations. Also speaking at the meeting were Lankowski, a representative of the Catholic Leaders' Consultative Committee, Szperl, a representative of the National Cooperation Center of Intellectuals' Clubs, former Polish Socialist Party leader Kijas, Olszewski, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Polish Students' Union, and representatives of ethnic minorities, regions, and factories. They all supported the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party and put forward some concrete suggestions concerning various aspects of national life.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 1st: Intense preparations are underway throughout Poland for the parliamentary elections. The term of the current parliament is coming to an end, and elections were originally scheduled for December of this year. Due to the State Council's consideration of the current special circumstances in Poland, it has been decided to postpone the elections to the end of January 1957.

　　In order to prepare well for this election, on November 28th, representatives of various parties and people's organizations jointly formed a central consultative committee and consultative committees at the local levels, based on the suggestion of the All-Poland Committee of the National Front. The central consultative committee will jointly plan the progress of the election work with the All-Poland Committee of the National Front. Representing the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party on the consultative committee are Zawadzki and Cyrankiewicz.

　　The consultative committee has decided that the parties will jointly put forward a list of candidates for members of parliament. This has great political significance in Poland. Because some people with ulterior motives had previously advocated adopting bourgeois election methods, with each party separately putting forward a list of candidates for members of parliament to compete in the election. The establishment of the consultative committee has shattered this attempt.

　　The scope of democracy has been expanded in this election. In the past, the number of people on the candidate list was the same as the number of members of parliament to be elected. This time, the candidate list has more candidates than the number of members of parliament to be elected. For example, if a district is to elect five members of parliament, there will be seven or eight candidates on the candidate list. Voters can elect five members of parliament from these seven or eight candidates. Therefore, the political enthusiasm of the people has been further enhanced.

    波兰举行社会和政治积极分子会议
　　各地正在紧张地进行议会选举筹备工作
    新华社华沙1日电　全波社会和政治积极分子会议11月29日在华沙举行。这个会议是由有各党派、人民团体的代表参加的波兰议会选举协商委员会和全国阵线全波委员会主席团召集的。
    到会的有波兰统一工人党领导人哥穆尔卡、萨瓦茨基、萨姆布罗夫斯基，波兰统一农民党、民主党领导人以及工会和其他社会团体代表共三千人。
    会议由全国阵线全波委员会主席萨瓦茨基主持开会。他强调指出，会议的口号是波兰全国的团结。他向会议提出的议程包括：各政党和人民团体代表的发言、讨论和通过关于选举问题的告波兰全国人民书。
    接着，哥穆尔卡代表统一工人党发表演说。他谈到了波兰的对外关系和国内的形势。
    统一农民党中央委员会主席伊格纳尔接着发言。他说，过去工农联盟的原则被歪曲了，目前使这种联盟复兴的条件又产生了，统一农民党能够起重要作用。波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议已经在各党的关系方面展开了一个以平等和独立为特色的新时期。统一农民党在困难的十月时期表示了支持波兰统一工人党的纲领，并且将与它并肩执行这个纲领。
    伊格纳尔接着表示相信，为了加速民主化的过程，有必要在不久的将来举行人民会议的选举。他说，在以后几年内，个体农民将继续是农业生产的基础。但是，必须要保证帮助和支持在完全自愿的原则上建立起来的农业合作社。
    民主党中央委员会主席库耳钦斯基在发言时谈到议会的作用。他说，议会最重要的任务应当是行使国民的最高权利。因此，议会必须把完全的立法责任担当起来，并且对政府的工作进行具体的全面的监督。议会必须有召开会议的明确的日期，应当规定向议会提出预算和经济计划的日期。库耳钦斯基说，民主党已经通过一项决议，宣布它决定同波兰统一工人党、统一农民党以及社会和政治团体一起参加选举。在会上发言的还有天主教领袖协商委员会代表兰科夫斯基、知识分子俱乐部全国合作中心代表什佩尔、前波兰社会党领导人基拉斯、波兰学生联合会中央委员会主席奥尔谢夫斯基以及少数民族、各地和工厂的代表。他们都拥护波兰统一工人党八中全会的决议，并且提出了一些有关国家各方面生活的具体建议。
    新华社华沙1日电　波兰各地正在紧张地进行议会选举筹备工作。本届议会任期将满，选举本应在今年12月举行。由于国务委员会考虑到目前波兰国内的特殊情况，决定把选举推迟到1957年1月底举行。
    为了很好地筹备这次选举，根据波兰全国阵线全波委员会的建议，各党派和各人民团体的代表在11月28日共同组成了中央协商委员会和地方各级的协商委员会。中央协商委员会将同全国阵线全波委员会共同筹划选举工作的进程。代表波兰统一工人党中央委员会参加协商委员会的有萨瓦茨基、西伦凯维兹。
    协商委员会已经决定由各党派统一提出议员候选人名单。这在波兰具有重大的政治意义。因为前些时曾有些别有用心的人主张采用资产阶级的选举方式，由各党派分别单独提出议员候选名单进行竞选。协商委员会的成立已粉碎了这一企图。
    这次选举中民主范围已经扩大。过去是：候选名单上的人数同应选的议员一样多，这次候选名单上的候选人则多于应选出的议员数目。比如一个区应选五个议员，而候选名单上则有七、八个候选人。选民可以在这七、八个候选人中选举五个议员。因此，全国人民的政治积极性已进一步提高。
