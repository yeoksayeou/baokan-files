　　Don't Blindly Relocate Factories
    The Luoyang Box Factory originally produced in Shanghai, and moved to Luoyang in July this year. Before the relocation, the workers raised questions – does Luoyang have raw materials? Is there enough production work? Are there any cooperative factories? The leadership replied: "Not a big problem." However, after moving to Luoyang, there was no production work, and raw materials still had to be transported from Shanghai. Except for the clerks, no one else in the factory had anything to do. Monthly salary payments were borrowed from the bank. The Luoyang Municipal Bureau of Industry invested 50,000 yuan in this factory, and now 140,000 yuan has been spent.
    The workers left their parents and wives to come to Luoyang, and encountered this situation. They said with grief and indignation: "We are not supporting national construction here, we are simply wasting the country's food!"
    At present, the distribution of industry in our country is unbalanced. Some places have surpluses, and some places have shortages. Therefore, it is necessary for some coastal factories to move to the inland areas. Doing so is originally a good thing for the development of the enterprise itself and for national construction. However, good things are ruined when problems are decided rashly without investigation and research.

　　不要盲目迁厂
    洛阳制盒厂原来在上海生产，今年7月迁到洛阳。迁厂前，职工们曾经提出过疑问——洛阳是否有原料？生产任务足不足？有没有合作厂？领导上答说：“问题不大。”可是迁到洛阳后，生产任务没有，原材料还得从上海运。厂里除了办事员外，其他的人都没有事情做。每月支付工资都向银行借贷。洛阳市工业局给这个厂投资五万元，现在已经花掉了十四万元。
    职工们离开父母妻子到洛阳来，碰到这种境况，悲愤地说：“我们这哪儿是支援国家建设呀，简直是给国家浪费粮食来啦！”
    目前我国的工业分布不平衡，有的地方多余，有的地方不足，因此沿海有些工厂迁到内地去是必要的。这样做，本来是对企业本身发展，对国家建设都有好处的事。但是，好事遇到了不调查研究就草率决定问题的，却办坏了。
