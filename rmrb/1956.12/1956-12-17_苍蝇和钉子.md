    Flies and Nails
　　Fan Rongkang
    When I was a child, I heard adults tell a joke: A nearsighted person was carrying a bottle of oil, and saw a black spot on the wall. He thought it was a nail, and hung the oil bottle on it. The oil bottle fell and broke. It turned out that the black spot was not a nailed-in nail, but a fly that was resting there. The second time, he saw another black spot on the wall, thinking it was a fly resting there. He muttered to himself, "Don't think I'll fall for that again," and slapped it with his hand, breaking his hand. It turned out that this time the black spot was not a fly, but a nailed-in nail.
    The first time I heard this joke, I thought it was satirizing the nearsighted person, and just laughed it off. When I grew up, I realized that the joke had a profound meaning: it satirizes some subjectivists in real life—they don't study the actual situation, and thus suffer a loss; but that's not all, after suffering a loss, they think they have gained wisdom, but they still don't study the actual situation, and as a result, they suffer another loss.
    Now, it is the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, and everyone from top to bottom is busy compiling plans for 1957. What everyone often talks about is to learn from the lessons of compiling plans over the years, in order to gain wisdom from suffering a loss. This, of course, is very good. However, truly gaining wisdom from suffering a loss is not an easy task, and requires careful study of where the loss was suffered. Hanging the oil bottle on a fly, ultimately leading to it breaking, was suffering a loss from not studying the actual situation, only knowing that nails on the wall have black spots, but not knowing that the black spots on the wall are not all nails, but also resting flies. The ridiculous thing about the nearsighted person in the joke is that he didn't learn from this essential issue. First, he thought that all black spots on the wall were nails, and then he thought that all black spots on the wall were flies, so he suffered losses both times.
    Some comrades who compile plans, the "lessons" they have found from the planning work over the years, are a bit similar to the "lessons" that the nearsighted person found from hanging oil bottles, which makes people worry that they will inevitably suffer another loss. Some leading comrades in a factory in Yunnan are like this. When they initially drafted the plan for 1957, they said: "This year we made an 'impetuous plan', which made us suffer. This time, the targets should be lower." In fact, whether it is impetuous or conservative, whether the targets are high or low, these are all manifested phenomena, and the essential problem is often an old saying in the planning department: "Did not study the actual situation," or it is something that cannot be done in reality, but is put forward in the plan; or it is something that needs to be done, and can be done in reality, but is not reflected in the plan. Therefore, the wisdom that should be gained is not "This time, the targets should be lower," but that plan compilation must study the actual situation. Taking the steel rolling workshop of this factory as an example, some indicators in this year's plan were impetuous. One of the reasons is that the plan was drawn up at the beginning of the year based on the output of skilled workers. In fact, many new workers participated in production without training, and could not reach this output. Suffering a loss and gaining wisdom means gaining this wisdom of studying the actual situation in everything. Now that the operating skills of the new workers are proficient, the factory's leading comrades only focus on the fact that "this year's plan was impetuous," thinking that they have already gained wisdom, and do not come to study this actual situation, but instead consider "This time, the targets should be lower." Isn't this also walking down the old path of that nearsighted person?
    The leading comrades of this factory later discovered this problem and began to correct it, striving to truly gain wisdom. Unfortunately, not everyone who has suffered a loss, thinks they have gained wisdom, but in reality has not truly gained wisdom, can timely discover that they are playing the role of that nearsighted person in the joke.

    苍蝇和钉子
　　范荣康
    小时候，听大人说过一段笑话：有个近视眼提着油瓶，见墙上有个黑点，以为是个钉子，把油瓶往上一挂，油瓶掉下来，碎了。原来那黑点不是钉着的钉子，而是停着的苍蝇。第二回，他又见墙上有个黑点，以为是停着的苍蝇，暗暗骂道：“别以为我会再来上当”，一巴掌拍上去，把手戳破了。原来这回那黑点不是停着的苍蝇，而是钉着的钉子。
    初听这段笑话，以为是讽刺近视眼的，一笑而已。长大了，才体会到这笑话意味深长：它讽刺的是现实生活中的一些主观主义者——他们不研究实际情况，因而吃了一亏；这且不说，吃了一亏，却自以为已经长了一智，还不研究实际情况，结果又吃了一亏。
    现在，正值岁末年初，从上到下都在忙着编制1957年的计划。大家常常谈的，是要好好地接受历年来编制计划的教训，以求从吃一亏中长一智。这，当然很好。可是，吃一亏而真正长一智，却不是一件容易的事，需要认真研究亏吃在哪里。油瓶往苍蝇上挂，终致摔破了，是吃了没有研究实际情况的亏，只知道钉在墙上的钉子都露个黑点，不知道墙上的黑点并不都是钉着的钉子，也有是停着的苍蝇。笑话中的近视眼可笑之处，就是没有从这个本质问题上来接受教训，始而以为凡是墙上的黑点都是钉子，继而以为凡是墙上的黑点都是苍蝇，因而两回都吃了亏。
    有些编计划的同志，从历年来的计划工作中找出来的“教训”，就有点同这位近视眼从挂油瓶中找出来的“教训”相似，很使人担心难免又要吃一亏。云南某厂有些领导同志就是这样。他们最初在拟订1957年的计划时，说：“今年订了个‘冒进计划’，搞苦了，这回指标可要低些”。其实，冒进也好，保守也好，指标高了也好，低了也好，都是表现出来的现象，本质问题常常是计划部门的一句老话：“没有研究实际情况”，或则是实际不能做到的，计划上提出来了；或则是需要做的，实际也能够做到的，计划没有反映出来。因而应该长的智，不是“这回指标可要低些”，而是编计划一定要研究实际情况。就拿这个工厂的轧钢车间来说，今年的计划中有些指标是冒进了。原因之一是年初订计划时是以熟练工人的产量来计算的，实际上许多新工人没有经过训练就来参加生产了，达不到这个产量。吃一亏，长一智，就是要长这个凡事一定要研究实际情况的智。现在，新工人的操作技术熟练了，厂的领导同志只扣住个“今年的计划冒进了”，以为已经长了一智，又不来研究这个实际情况，反而考虑“这回指标可要低些”，岂不是也在往那位近视眼的老路上走吗？
    这家工厂的领导同志后来发现了这个问题，开始纠正，力求真正长一智。可惜，并不是所有吃了一亏，自以为已经长了一智，而实际上并没有真正长一智的人，都能及时发现自己是在扮演笑话中的那位近视眼的角色。
