Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 3rd: Hong Kong news: The Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Federation held a memorial service for the workers killed in the Kowloon riots at its premises on the afternoon of the second. About 400 people attended, including family members of the deceased workers and representatives from various industries, associations, and circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

　　The venue was filled with a solemn and sorrowful atmosphere. The venue was surrounded by 440 elegiac couplets, memorial banners, and wreaths from various industry trade unions and people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macao. Portraits of the eight deceased workers were hung on the right wall. On the right side of the altar hung an inscription personally written by Guangdong Province Governor Tao Zhu: "Further strengthen the unity of all workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, safeguard the interests of the working class, and resolutely counter any counter-revolutionary actions that endanger the lives of the working class."

　　After playing mourning music, observing a moment of silence, and offering flowers to the memorial tablets of the deceased workers, Chen Yaochai, chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Federation, delivered a mournful eulogy at the meeting. He first mentioned that among those who were tragically killed in Tsuen Wan were Yang Guanfu, a pharmacist at the Tsuen Wan Medical Clinic of the Federation, textile workers Zhao Zhenxiang, Liang Zhu, Tan Zhiqiang, Qiu Daxin, Lan Tian, Lai Bolang, Liang Hongguang, and many other innocent compatriots. He said that all the facts have now completely proven that Kuomintang secret agents were the masterminds and murderers of the Kowloon riots, the public enemy of peaceful residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and the root cause of the threat to the peaceful environment of Hong Kong. Allowing the murderers to go unpunished would be the greatest disaster for Hong Kong, both now and in the future.

　　Chen Yaochai emphasized that since the grievances of the dead have not been redressed and the threat to the peaceful lives and the safety of residents' lives and property has not been lifted, the Kuomintang secret agent murderers who committed arson must be brought to justice and severely punished according to law. He also demanded that the Hong Kong police authorities should earnestly take responsibility for ensuring the safety of peaceful residents' lives and property and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

　　Chen Yaochai concluded by swearing before the spirits of the deceased workers that he would hold high the banner of unity and work harder for the peaceful lives and safety of lives and property of Hong Kong and Kowloon residents, and for the welfare of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers.

　　The memorial service then read out condolence messages from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and various circles in Guangdong Province. Three workers reported on the life stories of the eight deceased workers at the meeting.

　　Fei Yimin, Zhuang Wuzong, and Li Huiying, representatives from the press, business, and women's circles, also delivered eulogies at the meeting.

    港九工会联合会举行大会
　　追悼九龙暴乱中死难工人
  　死者之冤未雪，居民生命财产安全的威胁还未解除，杀人放火的国民党特务凶手必须依法归案严办
    新华社广州3日电　香港消息：港九工会联合会二日下午在会所举行九龙暴乱事件中死难工人的追悼大会。到会的有死难工人家属和港九各业工会、各社团和各界的代表共约四百人。
    会场笼罩着庄严和悲痛的气氛。会场四周摆满了港九和澳门各业工会及各界人士致送的四百四十件挽联、祭幛和花圈，右边墙上悬挂着八名死难工人的遗像。灵台右边还挂着广东省省长陶铸的亲笔题词：“进一步加强全港九工人的团结，保卫工人阶级的利益，对危害工人阶级生命安全的任何反革命行动，必须坚决予以回击”。
    在奏哀乐、默哀和向死难工人灵位献花以后，港九工会联合会理事长陈耀材在会上沉痛地致悼词。他首先谈到，这次在荃湾惨遭杀害的有工联荃湾医疗所配药师杨观福、纺织工人赵桢祥、梁注、谈志强、秋达新、蓝天、赖伯良、梁鸿光以及其他许多无辜死难同胞。他说，现在所有的事实已完全证明：国民党特务就是九龙暴乱事件的主谋和杀人犯，是港九和平居民的公敌，是威胁香港和平环境的祸根。如果让杀人犯逍遥法外，对香港来说，无论是现在或是将来，都是最大的灾害。
    陈耀材强调指出：现在死者之冤未雪，居民和平生活与生命财产安全的威胁还未解除，因此，杀人放火的国民党特务凶手必须依法归案严办。他还要求香港警察当局应当认真负起保障和平居民生命财产安全的责任，保证类似的事件不再发生。
    陈耀材最后还在死难工人的灵前宣誓，表示要高举着团结的旗帜，为港九居民的和平生活和生命财产的安全，为港九工人的福利事业而更加努力。
    追悼大会接着宣读了中华全国总工会和广东省各界发来的唁电。有三位工人在会上报告了八位死难工人的生平事略。
    在会上致悼词的还有新闻界人士、工商界和妇女界人士费彝民、庄我宗和李惠英等。
