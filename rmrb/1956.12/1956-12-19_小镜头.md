    Small Lens
    An Office Worker's "Reason"
    Depositor: What is the interest calculation for a one-year fixed deposit?
    Clerk: It's posted on the wall.
    Depositor: That's the interest rate table. I'm asking how it's calculated.
    Clerk: We are busy, and we are not arithmetic teachers.
    Depositor: Why is the interest only a little over three jiao for the fifty yuan I deposited for a year?
    Clerk: Don't make baseless statements. Where is the proof?
    Depositor: Look, this is your receipt.
    Clerk: This... this... mistakes are always possible; we can make up the difference for you.
    Depositor: If I didn't calculate it myself, I would have lost out.
    Clerk: That's nothing. If the interest is underpaid, it still belongs to the country!

    小镜头
    一个办事员的“理由”
    储户：定期储蓄存期一年，利息怎样算法？
    办事员：贴在墙上。
    储户：那是利率表，我是问怎样
    计算的。办事员：我们没有空，也不是算术教员。
    储户：我把五十元存了一年，为什么只有三角多利息？
    办事员：不要空口乱说，事实在哪里？
    储户：你看，这是你们的清单。
    办事员：这……这……差错总是有的，可以补给你。
    储户：假如我自己不算一下，就吃亏了。
    办事员：那不算啥，少付了利息，还不是国家的！
