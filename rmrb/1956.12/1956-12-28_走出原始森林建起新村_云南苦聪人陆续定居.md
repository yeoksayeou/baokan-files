Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 27th (Xinhua reporter Ye Zijian): In the primeval forests of the Ailao Mountains in southern Yunnan, more than six hundred 苦聪 people who had long lived a nomadic life of hunting have gradually settled down. Around the Citong Dam in the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province, several new villages of the 苦聪 people have appeared on the surrounding mountains.

The 苦聪 people are brave and resourceful, and every man is a skilled hunter. In the early days, they were settled, but they were driven into the deep mountains by reactionary rulers. Before liberation, the 苦聪 people lived in the great forest, never seeing the light of day. They lived in bamboo sheds covered with banana leaves, and when the banana leaves withered and curled up, they carried all their belongings – crossbows and machetes – and moved from place to place, migrating all year round. Many 苦聪 people had no clothes to wear and could not get salt. Wild game was their important source of livelihood. They were not familiar with agricultural production, and only a few people burned large areas of forest, poked holes in the burned land with wooden sticks, and threw in corn, waiting for the harvest.

Now, the settled 苦聪 people no longer practice slash-and-burn agriculture. They use the耕牛, plows, and hoes provided free of charge by the government to newly cultivate some rice paddies near their villages. With the help of their Dai and Yao brothers, they have learned to plow, harrow, transplant rice seedlings, and harvest. The People's Government has also given them new clothes and relief grain. The various medicinal materials they collect and the rattan they weave into household utensils are also purchased by trade departments at fair prices. The houses they live in were built by the People's Government with the help of their Dai brothers.

It is currently the coldest time of the year in the Ailao Mountains. Every evening, a vast expanse of white fog rises from the Honghe River. The 苦聪 people, who have been working all day, no longer huddle in banana sheds. In their new homes, they gather around warm hearths, cooking fragrant dinners.

In the past, the 苦聪 people numbered quite a few, but after being driven into the deep mountains, it is said that there are only more than seven hundred households left in the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region of Yunnan Province. From 1952 to the present, more than six hundred people have gradually settled down, and some are still scattered in the forest. The local government plans to send cadres, carrying salt and rice, to the sunless primeval forest to find them and help them settle down.

### 走出原始森林建起新村  云南苦聪人陆续定居

    走出原始森林建起新村
    云南苦聪人陆续定居
    新华社昆明27日电　新华社记者叶子健报道：在云南南部哀牢山的原始森林里，六百多个长期过着游猎生活的苦聪人，已经陆续定居下来。云南省红河哈尼族自治区境内茨通坝的四周山上，出现了几座苦聪人的新村庄。
    苦聪人勇敢机智，每个男子都是打猎的能手。很早的时候，他们是定居的，后来他们被反动统治者赶进了深山。解放前，苦聪人一直在大森林里过着不见天日的生活。他们住在用芭蕉叶复盖的竹棚里，芭蕉叶枯黄卷缩了，就携带着全部家产——弩箭和砍刀搬家，从这里到那里，终年不停地迁徙。许多苦聪人没有衣服穿，吃不到食盐，野味是他们重要的生活来源。他们不熟悉农业生产，只有少数人把大片的森林烧掉以后，用木棒在焚后的土地上戳些洞，投进玉米，等待收获。
    现在，定居后的苦聪人不再刀耕火种，他们用政府无偿发给的耕牛、犁铧和锄头，在自己村寨附近新垦了一些稻田，他们在傣族、瑶族兄弟的帮助下学会了用犁耙地、栽秧和收割。人民政府还给他们发了新衣服和救济粮。他们采集的各种药材和编织家庭用具的藤条，也由贸易部门以公平的价格收购。他们住的房屋，是由人民政府请傣族兄弟帮助他们修盖的。
    目前正是哀牢山严寒的日子，每当傍晚，红河里腾起了白茫茫的大雾，劳动了一天的苦聪人这时不再蜷伏在芭蕉棚里，他们在新居里围着温暖的火塘，烹调香味扑鼻的晚餐。
    从前苦聪人的人数并不少，但是被赶进深山以后，据说只在云南省红河哈尼族自治区里还有七百多户人。从1952年到现在，已经陆续定居的有六百多人，还有一些人零星地分布在森林里。当地政府准备派出干部，背上食盐和大米，到遮天蔽日的原始森林里去寻找他们，帮助他们定居。
