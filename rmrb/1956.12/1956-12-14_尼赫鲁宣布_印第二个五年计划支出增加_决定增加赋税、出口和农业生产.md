Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 13th. Prime Minister Nehru announced on December 8th, while presiding over a meeting of the National Development Council, that India's allocation for the Second Five-Year Plan has been increased by approximately 5 billion rupees, or even more. Originally, the allocation for the public sector in the Second Five-Year Plan was set at 48 billion rupees, but it is now 53 billion rupees.

Nehru pointed out that this situation arose due to three reasons: rising prices, the impact of the Suez Canal blockage on India's imports and exports, and the Indian government's additions to the Second Five-Year Plan. These additions specifically included incorporating the Rourkela steel plant into the public sector and allocating additional funds for shipping and oil exploration. Indian leaders decided to increase taxes, reduce imports, and increase exports, and emphasized the implementation of increased agricultural production targets to address the new problems encountered in India's development plan.

At the same time, Indian leaders are also looking to obtain foreign aid to bridge the gap between financial resources and goals in the Second Five-Year Plan. The Minister of Finance stated in a speech on December 10th that India has already received approximately 1.7 billion rupees in financial assistance from the United States, and recent negotiations with the World Bank have greatly helped in obtaining the foreign exchange needed for developing certain public utilities such as railways and ports. He also invited foreign investment in India.

(Editor's Note) India's Second Five-Year Plan (April 1956 – March 1961) was adopted by the Indian Parliament this September. The plan's main objectives are to increase national income, rapidly achieve industrialization, focus on developing basic and heavy industries, expand employment, and reduce inequality in income and wealth. The plan stipulates a total investment of 48 billion rupees (equivalent to 25 billion RMB) in the public sector, of which 18.5% is for industry and mining, 19% for irrigation and electricity, 28.9% for transportation, and 11.8% for agriculture. The main targets set by the Five-Year Plan are: to increase steel production from 1.3 million tons to 4.3 million tons, cotton fabrics from 6.85 billion yards to 8.5 billion yards, grain from an annual output of 65 million tons to 85 million tons, and national income to increase by 25%.

    尼赫鲁宣布
    印第二个五年计划支出增加
    决定增加赋税、出口和农业生产
    据新华社新德里13日电　尼赫鲁总理12月8日在主持国家开发委员会的会议的时候宣布，印度用于第二个五年计划的款项已经增加，增加的数目大约是五十亿卢比，或者还要多一些。本来在第二个五年计划中，用于公营部分的款项规定为四百八十亿卢比，但是现在是五百三十亿卢比。
    尼赫鲁指出，发生这种情况的三个原因是：物价的上涨、苏伊士运河被封锁对印度进出口的影响，以及印度政府补充了第二个五年计划。这些补充特别是把鲁尔克拉炼钢厂划入公营部分并且给航运和开采石油又拨了一些款。印度领袖们决定增加税收、削减进口和增加出口，并且强调执行提高了的农业生产指标，来解决印度发展计划所碰到的新问题。
    同时，印度领袖们也着眼于取得外国帮助来弥补第二个五年计划中财力和目标之间的悬殊。财政部长在12月10日的演说中曾经说，印度从美国已经获得了大约十七亿卢比的财政援助，而最近同世界银行的谈判已经使得为发展某些公用事业像铁路、港口等所需的外汇得到很大的帮助。同时他还请外国向印度投资。
    （编者注）　印度第二个五年（1956年4月—1961年3月）计划，是今年9月印度国会通过的。计划的主要目的是增加国民收入，迅速实现工业化，着重发展基本工业和重工业，扩大就业，减少在收入与财富上的不平等。计划规定公营部分总投资额达四百八十亿卢比（合人民币二百五十亿元），其中工矿业投资占18.5％，灌溉和电力占19％，交通运输占28.9％，农业占11.8％。五年计划规定的主要指标为：钢材由一百三十万吨增至四百三十万吨，棉织品由六十八·五亿码增至八十五亿码，粮食由年产六千五百万吨增至八千五百万吨，国民收入增加25％。
