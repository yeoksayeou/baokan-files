Increase production and practice economy and ensuring quality are things we should pay comprehensive attention to in our production and construction. We must never increase production and practice economy by reducing quality, nor can we disregard output and costs to improve quality in isolation. We must achieve both increased production and economy on the premise of ensuring quality.

Speaking of quality problems is already an old issue. Since the State Council issued the "Instructions on Inspecting the Quality of Industrial Products and the Quality of Basic Construction and Engineering" in November 1955, various localities once paid attention to quality issues, but later they were not taken seriously. Although the quality of products and projects this year has improved compared to last year, some quality is very unstable, and some has even declined.

In terms of heavy industrial products, many units this year producing pig iron, converter steel, high-quality steel, cement, raw coal, etc., have completed their output plans very well, but the quality has declined compared to last year. In the first quarter, the scrap rate of electric furnace steel at Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant accounted for a quarter of the total special steel scrap of the entire Iron and Steel Industry Bureau. One-third of the fifteen locomotives manufactured by Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant in the first quarter of this year needed to be reworked, and the loss from defective products in the entire quarter reached more than 200,000 yuan. It is particularly worth noting that the quality of raw coal has not reached the national planned target since 1954. The average ash content in 1954 was 20.46%, which rose to 21.53% in 1955. The actual ash content from January to September this year was 21.19%, a decrease of 0.34% compared to 1955, but compared with the national target of 20.4% ash content for raw coal from state-owned coal mines, it has not yet met the requirements. Workers at the Jixi Coal Preparation Plant said: "We are not picking stones from the coal, but picking coal from the stones." Someone once sent a sixty-jin stone to the Ministry of Coal Industry requesting its disposal. It can be seen that the product quality of some units in the heavy industry sector is still not satisfactory.

In terms of light industry, some products have approached or even reached international levels. However, according to the inspection of product quality in the first quarter by ten provinces and cities including Liaoning, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing, 40% of more than 600 major products are in a backward state or of low quality. The cream produced by the Inner Mongolia Dairy Industry Company has 700 tons unsold due to poor quality. The scissors of Zhang Xiaoquan in Zhejiang are also gradually failing to maintain their original characteristics. It can be seen that the quality of some products in light industry and handicrafts is also not very good.

In terms of engineering, various localities have made great efforts to tap potential, save construction materials, and reduce project costs this year, and have achieved certain results. The progress of many key projects has been accelerated compared to the past. However, there are still many quality accidents. According to statistics from the Ministry of Construction Engineering, a total of 11,188 accidents of various sizes occurred in construction and installation projects from January to October this year, with a loss of more than 410,000 yuan. Almost everywhere in a reinforced concrete frame structure factory building project undertaken by the Fifth Engineering Office of the North China Taiyuan Engineering Bureau, quality accidents occurred. Among the sixty-three concrete columns, more than fifty columns had 327 honeycomb holes, pitting, exposed steel bars, and holes. The largest area was 2.5 meters and the depth was 13 centimeters. They put strips of sacks, cement bags, bamboo poles, and hemp ropes into the concrete columns and foundations. Quality accidents in civil buildings are even more serious. According to incomplete statistics from five cities in Liaoning, a total of 3,559 quality accidents occurred in the third quarter, most of which were civil buildings. The continuous occurrence of diseases in newly built railways and the excessive slope and poor quality of newly built highways are also worthy of serious attention.

The quality of products and projects directly affects the country's production and construction and people's lives. For example, high ash content and many stones in raw coal not only affect the normal transportation of locomotives but also waste the country's transportation capacity. The poor quality of coking coal affects the production of pig iron. If the ash content of coking coal is reduced by 1%, the output of iron can be increased by 2.5%-3%. The poor quality of steel products will affect the production of the machinery industry and the quality of basic construction. The poor quality of products in the machinery manufacturing industry will affect the technical transformation of the entire national economy. The poor quality of light industrial products directly affects people's lives and causes dissatisfaction among the people. In short, all products and projects of poor quality will cause serious economic waste. Therefore, striving to improve the quality of products and projects is one of the urgent problems in China's socialist construction.

Of course, improving product quality and project quality is not a simple matter. It involves technical level, production equipment, technological reform, material supply, and other issues. The solution of these problems has a great impact on quality. Therefore, all enterprises with low technical levels and backward equipment need to take resolute measures to master the relevant technologies skillfully in a short period of time and gradually improve the backward state of equipment. This is a fundamental issue. However, many situations of poor quality are not entirely due to low technical levels. For example, is it because of a low technical level that coal is mixed with a large stone weighing sixty pounds? Is it also because of a low technical level that strips of sacks are put into the foundation engineering of concrete? Why do enterprises of the same type with the same technical level produce products of different qualities? Why is the quality of the same project very good at the beginning but then declines later? Why can't some qualities be stabilized at one level and continuously improved? It is undeniable that there are some ideological problems here.

Some people stubbornly put increased production and economy in opposition to quality. They believe that "to increase production, you cannot save money, and to save money, you cannot take care of quality." Some people say "quality first" in words, but in their hearts, it is still "quantity first." When accepting tasks, some units do not complete them according to the prescribed quality standards, but instead prepare to complete them by incorrectly reducing quality. Therefore, the phenomenon of shoddy workmanship and declining quality continues to appear. The situation of simply pursuing output value tasks, violating ordering contracts, and not producing according to variety also appears. And the main indicators of our national plan and statistics are always output, which has led to some higher-level leading departments often paying attention to output and not paying attention to or rarely paying attention to quality when deploying tasks and checking work, and letting some low-quality enterprises and units go downhill. This is an important reason for the poor quality of some products and projects. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "The superiority of socialism should not only be reflected in the quantity and speed of our economic achievements, but also in its quality." Our social system is an advanced socialist system, and socialism must continuously improve quality and produce high-quality products to gradually meet the growing production and living needs of the people. That kind of one-sided pursuit of quantity and neglect of quality is a violation of the Party and the country's socialist construction policy.

The weakness of the concept of quality is also a manifestation of the weakness of the mass concept. Because high-quality products and projects often bring happiness and joy to the masses, while low-quality things often bring trouble and harm to the masses. If the quality of medicines is not good, not only can they not cure diseases and save people, but they can easily misdiagnose and harm people. If the quality of machinery is not good, it will not only affect production but also easily cause casualties. As for the situations of rework and backlog caused by poor quality, it will cause great losses to both enterprises and consumers. Therefore, the quality issue is a major issue related to the lives of the people. The responsible personnel of enterprises must have a high degree of mass concept to treat every product part and every engineering building. It is necessary to conduct ideological education and mass concept education on ensuring quantity and improving quality to all relevant workers and employees within the enterprise. Those behaviors that ignore the interests of the masses, and even engage in fraud and deceive the masses, are contrary to the national legal system and social morality.

Currently, various localities are widely carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. According to past experience, when we mention increasing production and practicing economy, the numbers of product quantity, project progress, and savings easily become the goals that people pay attention to, while the quality issue is rarely noticed. For example, since the advocacy of reducing construction costs to save funds for the country in 1955, great achievements have been made, but deviations of neglecting quality have also occurred. In some railways, civil buildings, and even factory buildings, the phenomenon of low engineering quality has appeared. Ideological neglect of quality is specifically manifested in the lack of strict systems for design work, process regulations, and inspection work. Although many enterprise leaders subjectively hope to improve quality and meet the prescribed requirements, due to many shortcomings in organization, leadership, and work systems, and the failure to face these shortcomings squarely in ideology, they only grasp quantity and lose quality. Therefore, quality often lacks reliable guarantee. The Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out that increased production must be carried out under the conditions of guaranteed raw materials and social needs. At the same time, both increased production and economy must ensure work quality and pay attention to safety. In order to implement the spirit of the Party Central Committee's resolution, the leading departments of industrial production, construction, and transportation should place the quality issue in an important position when preparing to summarize this year's work and consider deploying next year's plans, establish and strictly implement the inspection system for product and project quality, and specifically help lower levels establish and improve process regulations and improve technical level. We must reward those departments that value and improve quality effectively, strictly criticize production units with poor quality, establish an atmosphere of valuing quality, so that we can truly achieve both resolutely implementing the policy of increasing production and practicing economy and effectively guaranteeing the quality of products and projects.

### 增产节约必须保证质量

    增产节约必须保证质量
    增产节约和保证质量，是我们生产建设中应该全面注意的事情。决不能以降低质量的办法来增产节约，也不能不顾产量不计成本而孤立地提高质量，必须在保证质量的前提下做到既增产又节约。
    说起质量问题已经是一个老问题了。自1955年11月国务院发布“关于检查工业产品质量和基本建设与工程质量的指示”以后，各地对于质量问题，曾一度引起注意，但后来又不很重视了。今年的产品质量和工程质量，虽然比去年有所改进，但是，有的质量很不稳定，有的反而下降了。
    在重工业产品方面，今年有不少的单位生产的生铁、转炉钢、优质钢材、水泥、原煤等，完成产量计划的情况很好，而质量却比去年下降。太原钢铁厂在第一季度内电炉钢的废品率，占钢铁工业管理局全季特殊钢废品总额的四分之一。大连机车车辆制造厂在今年第一季度制造的十五台机车中有三分之一需要返修，全季废品损失达二十多万元。特别值得注意的是，原煤质量自1954年以来一直没有达到国家计划指标，1954年平均灰分为20.46％，1955年上升到21.53％，今年一月到九月份实际灰分为21.19％，比1955年降低0.34％，但与国家要求国营煤矿原煤灰分20.4％的指标比较，还未达到要求。鸡西选煤厂的工人说：“不是从煤里拣矸石，而是从矸石里拣煤。”有人曾经把重量六十斤的一块石头寄到煤炭工业部要求处理。可见重工业方面某些单位的产品质量还是不能令人满意的。
    在轻工业方面，某些产品已经接近甚至达到国际水平，但是，据辽宁、广东、陕西、上海、天津、重庆等十个省、市第一季度对产品质量的检查，在六百多种主要产品中，有40％处于落后状态或者是质量低。内蒙古乳品工业公司出产的奶油，因为质量不好，有七百吨找不到销路。浙江张小泉的剪刀也逐渐不能保持原有的特点。可见轻工业和手工业方面的某些产品质量状况也不是很好的。
    工程方面，今年各地在挖掘潜力、节约建筑材料、降低工程造价等方面，作了很大的努力，取得了一定的成绩。许多重点工程的进度比过去加快了。但是，质量事故还很多。建筑工程部统计，今年一月到十月建筑安装工程共发生大小事故一万一千一百八十八次，损失四十一万余元。华北太原工程局第五工程处承担的一座钢筋混凝土框架结构的厂房工程，几乎到处发生质量事故，在六十三根混凝土柱子中，有五十多根柱子上有蜂窝、麻面、露筋、孔洞三百二十七处。面积最大的有二点五公尺，深度达十三公分。他们把成条的麻袋、水泥袋、竹竿、麻绳打在混凝土的柱子里和基础里。民用建筑的质量事故更加严重，据辽宁五个市的不完全统计，第三季度共发生质量事故三千五百五十九次，多数是民用建筑。至于新建的铁路不断发生病害，新建公路的坡度太大，质量很差等情况，也值得严重注意。
    产品质量和工程质量的好坏，直接影响到国家的生产建设和人民生活。譬如原煤的灰分高、矸石多，不仅影响机车的正常运输，还浪费国家的运输力量。炼焦煤的质量不好，就影响到生铁的生产。如果炼焦煤灰分降低1％，那末铁的产量就可以增加2.5％—3％。钢铁产品的质量不好，就要影响机械工业的生产和基本建设的质量。机械制造业的产品不好，就要影响整个国民经济的技术改造。轻工业的产品质量不好，直接影响到人民的生活，引起人民群众的不满。总之，一切质量不好的产品和工程，都会造成经济上的严重浪费。所以，努力提高产品质量和工程质量，是我国社会主义建设中迫切的问题之一。
    当然，提高产品质量和工程质量并不是一件简单的事情。它涉及到技术水平、生产设备、技术改革、材料供应等方面的问题。这些问题的解决对质量影响很大。因此，一切技术水平不高和设备落后的企业，需要采取坚决的措施，争取在短期内熟练地掌握有关技术，并且逐步改善设备落后的状况。这是一个根本性的问题。但是，目前许多质量低劣的情况，并不完全由于技术水平不高的缘故。像煤炭里混杂了六十斤重的大石块，难道这是因为技术水平不高吗？像成条的麻袋打在混凝土的基础工程里，难道也是技术水平不高吗？为什么同等的技术水平在同类的企业里会制造不同质量的产品呢？为什么同是一个工程，开始质量很好，后来却下降了呢？为什么有些质量不能稳定在一个水平上和不断提高呢？不可否认，这里有一些思想问题。
    有些人硬把增产节约同质量对立起来。认为“要增产就不能节约，要节约就顾不上质量”。有些人口头上“质量第一”，骨子里还是“数量第一”。有的单位在接受任务的时候，不是按照规定的质量标准去完成，而是准备以降低质量的不正确办法来完成。因此，粗制滥造、质量下降的现象就不断出现了。单纯追求产值任务，违反订货合同，不按品种生产的情况也出现了。而我们国家计划和统计的主要指标总是产量，这也就形成某些上级领导部门在布置任务、检查工作的时候，往往重视产量、不重视或很少重视质量，放任了某些质量低劣的企业单位沿着下坡路走去。这就是某些产品和工程质量不好的重要原因。刘少奇同志在向党的第八次全国代表大会作的政治报告中指出：“社会主义的优越性，不但要表现在我们的经济成就的数量和进度上面，还必须表现在它的质量上面。”我们的社会制度是先进的社会主义制度，社会主义就一定要不断地提高质量，生产出质量优良的产品来，逐渐满足人民群众日益增长的生产和生活需要。那种片面追求数量，忽视质量的想法和做法，是违反党和国家的社会主义建设方针的。
    质量观念的薄弱也是群众观念薄弱的表现。因为质量优良的产品和工程常常给群众带来幸福和愉快，而质量低劣的东西往往给群众带来麻烦和危害。假如医药品的质量不好，不仅不能治病救人，反而容易误病害人。机械的质量不好，不仅影响生产，而且容易造成伤亡事故。至于因质量不好，造成返工积压等情况，无论对企业或对消费者都会造成很大损失。所以，质量问题是关系人民群众生活的重大问题。企业的主管人员必须具有高度的群众观念，来对待每一个产品零件和每一项工程建筑。必须在企业内部向一切有关的工人和职员进行关于保证数量、提高质量的思想教育和群众观念的教育。那种忽视群众利益，甚至弄虚作假、欺骗群众的行为，是同国家法制、社会道德相抵触的。
    目前，各地正在广泛开展增产节约运动。根据过去的情况，一提到增产节约，那末，产品数量、工程进度和节约的数字就很容易成为人们注意的目标，而质量问题就很少有人注意了。例如自1955年提倡降低建筑造价为国家节约资金以来，收到了很大的成绩，但是也产生了忽视质量的偏差，在部分铁路、民用建筑甚至厂房建筑中，出现了工程质量低劣的现象。思想上忽视质量，具体表现在对设计工作、工艺规程和检验工作都缺乏严格的制度。虽然许多企业领导人员主观上都希望把质量搞好，达到规定的要求，但由于组织领导和工作制度上有许多缺点，思想上又没有正视这些缺点，只是抓住数量，丢掉质量，于是质量就常常缺乏可靠的保证。党的八届二中全会指出：增产必须在原料有保证和社会需要的条件下进行。同时，无论增产和节约都必须保证工作质量和注重安全。为了贯彻党中央的决议精神，各工业生产、建筑、运输的领导部门在准备总结今年工作和考虑部署明年计划的时候，应该把质量问题放在重要的位置上，建立和严格执行产品和工程质量的检查制度，具体帮助下级建立和改进工艺规程和提高技术水平。要奖励那些重视和提高质量有成效的部门，严格批评质量不好的生产单位，树立重视质量的风气，使我们真正做到既坚决贯彻增产节约的方针，又能切实保证产品和工程质量。
