　　From Famous Liquor to Wang Mazi
　　Guo Hua
    During a recent famous liquor appraisal, the fact that the quality of some famous liquors is declining was confirmed. One of the reasons why famous liquor from famous factories dares to disregard quality is precisely because they are famous liquors produced by famous factories.
    Most goods need a brand. There are already famous brands, brands that are becoming famous, and even more unnamed brands. Good quality goods bring many buyers, and the word spreads. Thus, a famous brand is established; thus, some famous brand owners become complacent. They no longer cherish the hard-won reputation of their brand, but instead exploit the weaknesses of customer psychology.
    My thoughts went from famous liquor to Wang Mazi. I have always enjoyed playing with small knives, and I am forgetful, always losing them soon after buying them. I heard that Wang Mazi knives and scissors are the most famous. I saw a small single-blade folding knife at a friend's place, unassuming in appearance, but its lightness and sharpness surpassed the average. It was said to be a Wang Mazi product, with an engraved inscription as proof. Since then, I have been paying attention, hoping to buy one for myself.
    One day, I happened to find a small shop with the words "Specializing in Wang Mazi Knives and Scissors" on the sign. I stopped the car to ask, but it was closed. I went across the street to another knife and scissor shop to inquire. They said that Wang Mazi knives and scissors no longer existed after the cooperativization. Now, there are only cooperative products. In their words, they seemed to be blaming me for not knowing about the great cooperativization movement.
    I strolled out of that shop called Wang Tianfu or something, feeling quite indignant about the disappearance of Wang Mazi. For so many years, his name had been affectionately passed on by housewives. Now, they have to go to great lengths to remember which cooperative it is, or simply stop caring about whose cooperative's product it is.
    From this, I also thought of the lessons learned from blindly merging factories and businesses during the high tide of cooperativization. Grasping principles and standards is inherently difficult, but some comrades in charge were too simplistic, inevitably leading to post-event reviews. Reviews are reviews, but some things can never be restored. It seems that Wang Mazi is probably gone forever. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel fortunate for the surviving century-old Chinese medicine stores, and also for the unknown Wang Tianfu-like stores, because they were spared the misfortune of being reduced to mere numbers and hope they quickly strive to establish a brand.

### 从名酒到王麻子

　　从名酒到王麻子
　　郭华
    今年有过一次名酒品评会，肯定了某些名酒质量日益下降的事实。名厂的名酒之所以敢于忽视质量，其中原因之一，正是因为它们是名酒而又出之于名厂。
    货物大都少不了一个牌子，有已经有名的牌子，有正在出名的牌子，更多的是无名的牌子。货色好，买主多，口口相传。于是名牌树立；于是有的名牌拥有者就飘飘然起来，他们不再珍惜名牌得来之不易，反而利用顾客心理的弱点了。
    我从名酒想到了王麻子。一向很爱玩小刀，人又健忘，总是买了用不多久便丢失了。听人说王麻子刀剪最为有名。在友人处见到一把单片小折刀，外貌不扬，其轻便锋利却超过一般，据说是王麻子的货，并有鐫字为凭。自此以后，留心察访，颇想自己也购得一件。
    有一天，凑巧发现一家小店，字招上是专售王麻子刀剪几个大字，停车一问，却闭门歇业了。转到对门另一家刀剪店打听，据说，王麻子刀剪在合作化以后便没有了。现在只有合作社的货。言谈之中，颇有责怪我竟不知道有伟大的合作化运动一事似的。
    我从那家叫做王天福什么的店内踱出来，对王麻子的不复存在，颇有不平。他的名字，曾多少年来在家庭主妇的口头上亲昵地传诵着的吧。她们现在得费很大的劲去记忆第几合作社，或者从此根本不再去理会是第几合作社的出品。
    由此，我又想到在合作化高潮中盲目并厂合营的教训。原则和尺度，如何掌握，本非易事，而某些工作同志却又过于从简，以致难免于事后作检讨。检讨是检讨，某些东西却再也恢复不过来。看来，王麻子大约是永远休矣了。想到这里，我不禁为那幸存的中药百年老店而庆幸，也为那不知名的王天福之类的店而庆幸，因为他们都幸免于数目号码字的厄运，并盼他们赶快努力树立起一个牌子来。
