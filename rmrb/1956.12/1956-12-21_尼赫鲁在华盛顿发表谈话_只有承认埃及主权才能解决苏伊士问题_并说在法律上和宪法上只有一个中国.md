Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru answered various questions raised by American reporters at a press conference in Washington on the 19th.

One reporter asked Nehru if he had brought a message from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to Eisenhower.

Nehru replied: "I did not bring any specific message from Mr. Zhou Enlai. But naturally, I have met with him, I talked about it to the President, and I explained to him the main points of our talks on certain issues of common concern.

"As many of you know, Mr. Zhou Enlai is a rather outstanding figure, an impressive person. He explained to me China's views on certain issues in Asia, and I have conveyed this view to the President, but not as his message to the President, I just want to explain their thinking."

The reporter then asked Nehru to explain the main points.

Nehru replied: "They said – I am merely repeating – that we have taken a few steps forward, but there has not been a good response from the other side. Generally speaking, that is the main point of their position."

One reporter raised the question of the so-called "Two Chinas."

Nehru replied: "Legally and constitutionally, there is only one China." "The question of two Chinas does not arise."

"Obviously, the Taiwan government is at most the government of Taiwan, not China."

"Let me say that the map will show you, whatever it is, it is not China. It is Taiwan, it is a bit far-fetched to call it China."

One reporter asked Nehru to evaluate the Soviet Union's "moral force."

Nehru replied: "Regarding the Soviet Union, as with any country, including India, you will find many good things and many bad things, perhaps to varying degrees. I don't know if you want me to discuss communism itself, or its application, these are big questions. Obviously, there are many things in the Soviet Union, past and present, that I disagree with.

"Many things have happened; but from the situation as it is today, I find the Soviet people to be a very friendly people, a hospitable people, and ardently hopeful for peace." He also expressed his belief that the trend in the Soviet Union is moving towards "democratization."

When discussing the Middle East issue, Nehru pointed out that the aggression against Egypt has made the resolution of the Middle East issue more difficult than before. He stressed that the Suez issue can only be resolved with due recognition of Egyptian sovereignty over the canal.

One after another, American reporters at the reception asked Nehru for his opinion on the Hungarian event and Soviet policy. Someone asked why India did not "condemn" the Soviet Union? Someone else asked, in Nehru's view, whether the Soviet Union was "a colonial country"?

In response, Nehru said that India had expressed "disagreement" with the situation in Hungary. However, he believes that condemnation alone is not a solution, the question is to offer constructive suggestions. As for the issue of colonialism, he said, "This word has a certain meaning," and it cannot be applied to the Soviet Union, but he said: "But the question is: apart from the word, it is very clear in the Hungarian event that the Soviet Union is exerting a dominant influence and power there."

Someone asked Nehru whether his talks with Eisenhower had led him to believe that current US policy was "more acceptable" to India? Nehru replied: "My impression is that American policy is a flexible policy, depending on the circumstances. It is not as rigid as I thought."

Someone asked whether, in his talks with Eisenhower, the United States had expressed "more sympathy" for India's "non-alignment" policy? Nehru said that he believed the United States "has more understanding of it (India's policy) and a little more respect for it."

When discussing foreign aid, Nehru said that India recognizes that economic construction mainly depends on the Indian people, but "foreign aid can play a role, so it is welcome."

Nehru also expressed his hope to strengthen ties with Latin American countries, saying that India and these countries "firmly believe in national independence and peace." He hopes to be able to visit these countries one day.

Nehru also discussed disarmament, Kashmir, and other issues at the press conference.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 20th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru concluded his official talks with US President Eisenhower on the 19th.

On this day, Nehru attended a luncheon hosted by former US Ambassador to India, current Senator Cooper, and held a second meeting with Dulles.

Afterwards, Nehru also met with US Presidential Assistant for Disarmament Stassen.

    尼赫鲁在华盛顿发表谈话
    只有承认埃及主权才能解决苏伊士问题
    并说在法律上和宪法上只有一个中国
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：印度总理尼赫鲁19日在华盛顿记者招待会上回答了美国记者们所提出的各种问题。
    有一个记者问尼赫鲁有没有替中国总理周恩来带口信给艾森豪威尔。
    尼赫鲁回答说：“我没有从周恩来先生那里带来什么具体的口信。但是自然，我曾经同他会谈过，我向总统谈了这件事，并且向他说明了我们就某些共同有关的问题进行的会谈的要点。
    “你们许多人知道，周恩来先生是一位相当杰出的人物，是给人留下深刻印象的人。他向我说明了中国对亚洲的某些问题的看法，我已经把这种看法转告总统，但是并不是作为他的口信告诉总统的，我只是要解释他们的想法。”
    记者又要求尼赫鲁说明其中的要点。
    尼赫鲁回答说：“他们说——我仅仅重复一下——我们已经向前走了几步，但是对方没有良好的反应，一般讲，这就是他们的立场的要点。”
    有一个记者提出了关于所谓“两个中国”的问题。
    尼赫鲁回答说：“在法律上和宪法上来讲，只有一个中国。”“两个中国的问题并不产生。”
    “显然，台湾政府最多不过是台湾政府，而不是中国。
    “让我说，地图将指给你看，不管它是什么东西，但它总不是中国。它是台湾，要叫它中国，是有点牵强了。”
    有一个记者要求尼赫鲁对苏联的“道义力量”作出评价。
    尼赫鲁回答说：“关于苏联，正如关于包括印度在内的任何国家一样，你会发现既有很多好处，也有很多坏处，程度可能不一样。我不知道你是不是要我讨论共产主义本身，或者是它的运用，这些是大问题，显然，过去和现在在苏联有许多事情是我所不同意的。
    “发生了许多事情；但是从今天他们的情况看来，我发现苏联人民是一个非常友好的人民，好客的人民，并且热烈地希望和平。”他还表示相信苏联的趋势正朝着“民主化”的方向发展。
    尼赫鲁在谈到中东问题的时候指出，对埃及的侵略行动已经使中东问题的解决比以前更为困难了。他着重说，必须正当地承认埃及对运河的主权，才能解决苏伊士问题。
    参加招待会的美国记者一个接一个地要求尼赫鲁就匈牙利事件和苏联的政策发表意见。有人问，印度为什么不“谴责”苏联？又有人问，在尼赫鲁看来，苏联是不是“一个殖民主义的国家”？
    尼赫鲁在回答时表示，印度已经表示“不同意”匈牙利的情况。但是他认为单是谴责并不是办法，问题在于提出建设性的建议。至于殖民主义的问题，他说，“这个字眼有一定的意义”，它不能适用于苏联，不过他说：“但是问题是：除了字眼以外，在匈牙利事件中看得很清楚，苏联在那里发挥支配性的影响和权力。”
    有人问尼赫鲁，他同艾森豪威尔的会谈是否已经使他认为目前的美国政策是印度“比较可以接受”的？尼赫鲁回答说：“我的印象是，美国的政策是一种灵活的政策，视环境而定。并不像我所想的那样刻板。”
    有人问，在他同艾森豪威尔的会谈中，美国是否对印度的“不参加集团”的政策表示了“更多的同情”？尼赫鲁说，他认为美国“已经对它（印度的政策）有了更多的了解，而且对它有了一点较大的重视”。
    尼赫鲁在谈到外援问题的时候表示印度认识到在经济建设中主要要靠印度人民，但是“外援能起作用，因此它是受欢迎的”。
    尼赫鲁还表示希望加强同拉丁美洲国家的联系，他说，印度和这些国家“都坚决相信民族独立和和平”。他希望有一天能够去访问这些国家。
    尼赫鲁在记者招待会上还谈到了裁军、克什米尔等问题。
    新华社20日讯　华盛顿消息：印度总理尼赫鲁19日结束了同美国总统艾森豪威尔的正式的会谈。
    尼赫鲁在这一天出席了前美国驻印度大使、现任参议员库柏的午宴，并且同杜勒斯举行了第二次会谈。
    之后，尼赫鲁又接见了美国总统裁军助理史塔生。
