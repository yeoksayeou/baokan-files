Mollet's Road
	Yuan Xianlu

Anyone who has read the works of the great French writer Molière will be familiar with the image of the hypocrite depicted by this master. Just like the hypocrite in Molière's works who "shamelessly borrowed God's name to cover up" his crimes, now, French Prime Minister Mollet also wants to use the name of "morality" to cover up the blood of the Egyptian people on his hands. He attempts to prove to the world that France's aggression has made a huge contribution to the cause of world peace, and that the bloody massacre in Egypt is entirely in line with humanitarian principles. He shamelessly beats his chest and says: "If someone had said 'no' to Hitler in 1936, that person would still be criticized today, because no one would understand that it was thanks to him that a war was avoided."

A night owl carrying an olive branch does not make it a dove of peace. Mollet's eloquent rhetoric will never change his true colors. Does launching an aggression against Egypt in 1956 equal saying "no" to Hitler in 1939? There is no need to refute this absurd and nonsensical analogy, because Hitler's former colleague Hess has already spoken. This war criminal, sentenced to life imprisonment, said in Munich prison that his crimes are no greater than those of the British and French leaders who attacked Egypt.

This situation cannot help but evoke a sigh of past events that are unbearable to recall. From 1939 to 1945, Mollet participated in the fight against Hitler; but today, he is doing the work of murder and arson like Hitler. From resistance fighter to aggressor, this is the sad road Mollet has taken. Especially in the ten months since he was ordered to form a cabinet and became Prime Minister in February of this year, he has completed this downhill road at a linearly decreasing speed.

In February, France was under the attack of a cold wave unseen for many years, but the political trends in France made ordinary people in France feel a warmth from the bottom of their hearts. The great victory of the democratic forces in the French general election at the beginning of this year announced the bankruptcy of the parliamentary right-wing majority. At this time, Mollet ascended to the Prime Minister's seat and also proposed a program that somewhat met the hopes of ordinary people in France.

In March, France reached agreements with Morocco and Tunisia one after another. Two new independent countries appeared in the world, and the situation in North Africa was full of optimism. In April, Mollet gave an interview to a reporter from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine that attracted worldwide attention. He agreed with peaceful coexistence, advocated putting disarmament first, and fiercely criticized the foolishness of that "ally" across the Atlantic who stubbornly clung to the "policy of strength." Then came May. Just as lilacs were in full bloom, Mollet and his Foreign Minister Pineau left Paris to visit Moscow. There, he raised a glass for French-Soviet friendship and peaceful coexistence, and expressed his willingness to attend the funeral of the "Cold War." At that time, smiles of relief appeared on the faces of ordinary French people, and there was nothing strange about that.

But at the same time, the French people also had some worries in their hearts. They were worried that Mollet would no longer move forward and would instead retreat. At that time, the Paris "International Forum" weekly reflected people's worries in an article. The article wrote: "We want to make it clear to the Mollet government that it would be wrong to limit its progress, and it would be even more wrong if it expressed regret for its earlier intentions."

The French people's worries were not unfounded. Just as the character of Danish Prince Hamlet was full of contradictions, Mollet's political attitude was also full of contradictions. On the one hand, Mollet declared that he refused to partner with reactionary parties. He said: "It is inconceivable to cooperate with people we have condemned before the entire country. No advanced knowledge is needed to understand that since there are differences of opinion on all issues, we cannot form an alliance with the right wing without abandoning or betraying our主張." On the other hand, Mollet vowed not to cooperate with the French Communist Party. He said: "As long as I hold a responsible position in the government or hold a leading position in the Socialist Party," there will be no Popular Front. In this way, Mollet seemed to strike a posture of "fighting in an onslaught." But the French people understood that this was a dangerous posture. Because, on the French political stage, if a politician waves the black flag of anti-communism, then no matter what role he appears in at the beginning, he will eventually roll to the side of reactionary forces.

In fact, Mollet is also rolling to the right. Regarding the Algerian issue, he sang a high-profile tune of peaceful negotiations before taking office, but after taking office, he implemented a policy of armed suppression. He insisted that the French Communist Party's assertion of safeguarding the Algerian people's right to national independence violated the national interests of France, but he did his best to protect the money bags of colonial billionaire. He took away the children and husbands from countless French mothers and wives, drove hundreds of thousands of young people to the battlefield, and took away bread from every family's table, taking nearly 500 billion francs to feed guns and cannons. Although the "dirty war" became more and more hopeless, he still had no intention of giving up.

Finally, the moment of testing came. On July 26, with a loud thunder, Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. Many Western newspapers at the time asked: How could a socialist who advocates the nationalization of enterprises oppose the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company? However, Mollet easily solved this problem. He abandoned the principles that socialists have always touted and completely rolled into the mire of degeneration. He was determined to make the more than 20 million Egyptians who were striding forward on the road to independence on the banks of the Nile bow their heads, so that a small group of French billionaires could firmly grasp the Suez Canal in their hands and steadily step on Algeria.

So, Mollet, together with his partner across the Strait—British Prime Minister Eden—exhausted all kinds of slander, abuse, deceit, intimidation, and used all kinds of rogue methods; however, the result was a waste of effort, and the Egyptian people did not bow their heads.

At the end of October, Mollet decided to take his most shameful step—to murder and set fire in Egypt, this newly born ancient country. When he announced this evil plan in the Palais Bourbon, the right-wing members standing in the pockets of monopoly capitalists cheered and cheered like wolves, while the members of Mollet's own party bowed their heads in silence. Perhaps some of them still remember the words of the great French socialist Jaurès: "When cases of suspension begin to appear, we must say to the rulers: ... no war, no bloodshed, request the arbitration of mankind, listen to the arbitration of reason! If you are unwilling, well, you are a government composed of rogues, a government composed of bandits, a government composed of murderers. And the responsibility of the proletarians is to revolt against you..." However, in the French National Assembly, only the Communists raised their righteous hands to vote against the war instigators who were condemned by Jaurès as rogues, bandits, and murderers, while those Socialists who shamelessly claimed to be inheriting Jaurès's tradition shamefully obeyed Mollet's will or cowardly used abstentions to evade their responsibilities.

The military adventure against Egypt began and soon ended ingloriously. Endless disasters shrouded France like a dense fog. At this time, looking back at some of Mollet's pleasant remarks before and after taking office cannot help but make people feel a strong sense of irony. Improve the lives of the working people? No, layoffs, tax increases, soaring prices, and shortages of daily necessities have forced them to tighten their belts even tighter. Peaceful resolution of the North African issue? No, blood is flowing heavily in Algeria, and France's relations with Morocco and Tunisia are getting worse and worse. Pursue an independent foreign policy? No, the deterioration of the economy has forced France to look at Washington's face more carefully. A few months ago, Mollet taught his American friends to pay attention to the manner when giving gifts, and now he is already knocking on the door of the White House to beg for alms. Ease the international situation? No, France has not played any good role, but has instead sat on the defendant's seat of aggressors in the court of world opinion together with Britain and Israel. There is no need to wait until the coffin is closed to make a conclusion about Mollet.

Therefore, Mollet found himself in a storm of condemnation. Domestically, it is not only the French Communists who oppose his shameful act of aggression. The Radical Socialist Party led by Mendès France condemned him, and many important figures in his own Socialist Party fiercely attacked him.

"After the party leaders came to power, they not only violated their promises to the voters, but also destroyed all moral principles and socialist traditions." Madame Viénot, a famous socialist political activist, made such a judgment on Mollet and then announced her resignation from the party.

The Mollet government is a government "without any principles"; the consequences of the aggression against Egypt are "tragic for France, and even more tragic for French socialism." Some important figures from the Seine Provincial Committee of the Socialist Party put forward this view in an open letter and demanded that an emergency party congress be convened immediately to discuss the Suez Canal issue and the Algerian issue.

Seventeen Socialist Party members of parliament issued a letter protesting Mollet's "disastrous policies." Among those who signed this letter were Moc, the representative of France's permanent delegation to the United Nations Disarmament Committee Subcommittee, Meyer, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, and Alain Savary, the former Minister of Moroccan and Tunisian Affairs who recently resigned.

Even André Philip, a member of the Steering Committee of the Socialist Party, wrote to the leading body of the Socialist Party, the members of the Socialist Party, and the parties that joined the Socialist International, severely criticizing Mollet's policies.

Deserted by his followers! This is Mollet's situation. Mollet is gloomily worrying about his future. However, he seems to be less ashamed than Eden, who would become "overworked" by being condemned by public opinion. In a television broadcast, he even vowed in the name of France that he would "not regret his actions."

But where can support be obtained? Mollet looked around and finally fixed his gaze on the right. There, there was also a lot of noise. "Accepting a ceasefire without completely occupying the Suez Canal is surrender, it's a regression!" Someone shouted loudly. Others then issued bloodthirsty calls: "Try a new adventure: in the Middle East, in North Africa, or elsewhere!"

So, Mollet announced to the country with a calm expression the government's future policy on Algeria. He tried his best to pretend to be sincere and said that the military operations in Algeria were coming to an end, and then negotiations and reforms would be used to give the Algerian people equal status. However, at the same time, he also produced the 1957 national budget. Written on this bill was: France was to maintain an army of 1.23 million people, and military spending in Algeria was also greatly increased.

Mollet has reached a shameful end on his political path. He will continue to do so. But no matter how he struggles, he cannot escape such an inevitable ending—the torrent of the people's will will sweep him into the trash heap of history. (Attached picture)

    摩勒的道路
    袁先禄
    凡是读过法国伟大的作家莫里哀的作品的人，都会熟知这位大师所刻画的伪君子的形象。正像莫里哀笔下的那个“恬不知耻地借了上帝的名义来掩盖”他的罪行的伪君子一样，现在，法国总理摩勒也想借用“道义”的名义，来掩盖他自己手上沾染的埃及人民的鲜血。他企图向全世界证明：法国的侵略行为对世界和平事业作出了巨大的贡献，在埃及的一场血腥屠杀完全合乎人道主义的原则。他毫不脸红地拍着胸膛说：“假如有人曾经在1936年对希特勒说过‘不’，那个人在今天一定还要受到批评，因为谁也不会懂得，多亏他才避免了一场战争。”
    枭鸟衔了一根橄榄树枝，并不会因而成为和平鸽。摩勒的滔滔雄辩，也决不会改变他的本来面目。在1956年对埃及发动侵略会等于在1939年对希特勒说“不”字吗？人们没有必要再来驳斥这种荒谬绝伦、不知所云的比拟，因为希特勒当年的同僚赫斯已经发言了。这个被判处无期徒刑的战犯在慕尼黑监狱里说：他的罪行并不比进攻埃及的那些英法领袖们大。
    此情此景，不禁使人有往事不堪回首之慨。在1939年到1945年，摩勒曾经参加过反对希特勒的战斗；而今天，他却像希特勒那样干起杀人放火的行当来了。从抵抗战士到侵略者，这就是摩勒所走的可悲的道路。特别是在今年2月他受命组阁、出任总理以来的十个多月中，他以直线下降的速度走完了这条下坡路。
    2月，法国正处在多少年来未曾有过的寒潮袭击下，但是法国国内的政治动向却使法国的普通人从心底里感到一丝温暖。今年年初法国大选中民主力量的巨大胜利，宣告了议会右翼多数的破产。这个时候，摩勒登上了总理的座位，并且还提出了多少还符合法国普通人希望的纲领。
    3月，法国同摩洛哥和突尼斯的谈判先后达成了协议，世界上出现了两个新的独立国家，北非的局势充满着令人乐观的气氛。4月，摩勒对“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊的记者发表了一篇引起全世界注意的谈话。他赞成和平共处，主张把裁军问题放在第一位，并且猛烈地抨击大西洋彼岸那个“盟国”死抱住“实力政策”不肯放手的愚蠢做法。紧接着是5月，正当丁香花盛开的时候，摩勒和他的外交部长比诺离开巴黎去访问莫斯科。在那里，他为法苏友谊和和平共处举杯，并且表示愿意参加“冷战”的葬仪。当时，欣慰的微笑涌上了法国普通人的脸庞，这是没有什么可以奇怪的。
    但是，在这同时，法国人民的心里也有着某种忧虑。他们担心：摩勒会不再向前走，而将往后退。当时巴黎“国际论坛”周刊在一篇文章里就反映了人们的这种忧虑。这篇文章写道：“我们要对摩勒政府说清楚：它限制自己的进展将是错误的，要是它对自己前些时候的意图表示遗憾，那就更为错误。”
    法国人民的担心并不是无缘无故的。正像丹麦王子哈姆雷脱的性格充满着矛盾一样，摩勒的政治态度也充满着矛盾。一方面，摩勒宣称拒绝同反动政党搭伙。他说：“要和我们在全国面前谴责过的人们合作是不可思议的事。无需高深的学问也可以懂得：既然在全部问题上有意见分歧，我们就不可能和右派结成联盟而不放弃或者背叛我们的主张。”另一方面，摩勒又发誓不同法国共产党合作。他说：“只要一天我还担当着政府的负责职务或者是担任着社会党的领导”，那就不会有人民阵线。就这样，摩勒俨然摆出一副“在夹攻中奋斗”的姿态。但是法国人民懂得，这是一副危险的姿态。因为，在法国的政治舞台上，如果一个政治家打着反共的黑旗，那末无论他在开始是以怎样的角色出现的，最后终究是会滚到反动力量一边去的。
    实际上，摩勒也正在向右滚。对于阿尔及利亚问题，他上台前唱的是和平谈判的高调，上台后执行的却是武装镇压的政策。他硬说法国共产党人维护阿尔及利亚人民民族独立权利的主张违背了法兰西的民族利益，自己却鞠躬尽瘁地保卫着殖民集团亿万富翁的钱袋。他从无数法国的母亲和妻子的身边夺走了她们的孩子和丈夫，把好几十万青年驱上了战场，他从每个家庭的餐桌上夺走了面包，把近五千亿法郎拿去喂枪炮。尽管“肮脏战争”越打越没有希望，他还是没有罢手之意。
    终于，考验的关头到来了。7月26日，一声巨雷，埃及宣布把苏伊士运河公司收归国有。不少西方的报刊当时问道：主张企业国有化的社会党人怎样来反对苏伊士运河公司的国有化呢？然而，摩勒轻而易举地解决了这个难题。他扔开社会党人一向标榜的原则，完全滚进了堕落的泥坑。他决心要使在尼罗河畔在独立的道路上昂首前进的两千多万埃及人低头，来让法国一小撮亿万富翁们手里牢牢抓住苏伊士运河，脚下稳稳踩着阿尔及利亚。
    于是，摩勒和海峡对岸的伙伴——大英帝国的首相艾登一起，使尽了污蔑辱骂，欺骗恫吓，使出了各式各样的流氓手段；然而，结果是枉费心机，埃及人民并没有低头。
    10月末，摩勒决定跨出他最可耻的一步——到埃及这个新生的古国去杀人放火。当他在波旁宫里宣布这个罪恶的计划时，站在垄断资本家夹袋里的右翼议员们像狼嗥一样地喝采欢呼了，而摩勒自己党里的议员们却不声不响地低下了头。也许，他们中间有人还记得法国伟大的社会主义者若莱士的话：“当开始出现悬案的时候，我们要对统治者说：……不许打仗，不许流血，请求人类的仲裁，听从理性的仲裁吧！假如你们不愿意，好吧，你们就是无赖组成的政府、匪徒组成的政府、凶手组成的政府。而无产者的责任，就是起义来反对你们……。”但是，在法国国民议会里，只有共产党人举起正义的手来投票反对被若莱士谴责为无赖、匪徒和凶手的战争发动者，而那些恬然以继承若莱士传统自居的社会党人却可耻地顺从了摩勒的意志，或者懦怯地用弃权来逃避自己的责任。
    对埃及的军事冒险开始了，不久又不光采地结束了。无穷无尽的灾难，像浓雾一样笼罩着法国。这个时候，再回顾一下摩勒上台前后一些动听的言论，不能不使人感到有一种强烈的讽刺。改善劳动人民的生活？不，解雇、加税、物价暴涨和日用品缺少，已经逼得他们把裤带勒得更紧了。和平解决北非问题？不，在阿尔及利亚血正在大量地流，法国同摩洛哥和突尼斯的关系也越来越坏了。奉行独立自主的外交政策？不，经济的恶化使法国不得不更加小心地看着华盛顿的脸色，几个月以前摩勒还教训美国朋友在送礼时要讲究方式，现在他已经在紧叩白宫的大门去乞求施舍了。缓和国际局势？不，法国并没有起什么良好的作用，反而和英国、以色列一起在世界舆论的法庭里坐上了侵略者的被告席。无需盖棺，人们对摩勒已经可以作出定论了。
    因此，摩勒发觉自己正处在谴责的暴风雨中。在国内，反对他这种可耻的侵略行为的，已经不仅仅是法国共产党人。孟戴斯—弗朗斯领导的激进社会党指责他，在他自己所领导的社会党里也有不少重要的人物猛烈地攻击他。
    “党的领导人在取得政权以后，不但违背了对选民的诺言，而且破坏了所有的道义原则和社会主义传统。”社会党著名的女政治活动家维耶诺夫人对摩勒作出了这样的判断，然后宣布退党了。
    摩勒政府是一个“没有任何原则”的政府；侵略埃及的后果“对法国说来是悲惨的，而对法国的社会主义说来则更加悲惨”。社会党塞纳省委员会的一些重要人士在一封公开信里提出了这样的看法，并且要求立即召开一次党的紧急代表大会来讨论苏伊士运河问题和阿尔及利亚问题。
    十七个社会党议员发出了一封信件，抗议摩勒的“灾难性的政策”。在这封信上签名的有法国常驻联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的代表莫克，法国国民议会外交委员会主席麦耶，以及辞职不久的前摩洛哥和突尼斯事务部长阿兰·沙瓦里等人。
    甚至，连社会党指导委员会委员安德烈·菲利普也写信给社会党的领导机构、社会党议员以及加入社会党国际的各党，对摩勒的政策大加抨击。
    众叛亲离！这就是摩勒的处境。摩勒黯然地为自己的前途发愁了。但是，他似乎比受到舆论谴责就会“劳累过度”的艾登更缺少羞耻之心。在一次电视广播中，他竟然以法国的名义发誓：他决“不对自己的行动感到遗憾。”
    但是，从那里可以得到支持呢？摩勒环顾四周，终于把视线停留在右边。那里，也是一片吵嚷声。“没有完全占领苏伊士运河就接受停火，这是投降，这是倒退！”有人这样大声叫喊。另外一些人接下去发出渴血的呼号：“尝试一次新的冒险吧：在中东，在北非，或者在其它地方！”
    于是，摩勒带着镇定自若的神情向全国宣布今后政府对阿尔及利亚的政策。他竭力装出诚挚的声调说：在阿尔及利亚的军事行动快结束了，接着就要用谈判和改革来使阿尔及利亚人民得到平等的地位。然而，同时他又拿出了1957年的国家预算。在这张账单上写着：法国要维持一百二十三万人的军队，在阿尔及利亚的军费开支也大大增加了。
    摩勒在他的政治道路上已经走到了可耻的终点。他还要继续干下去。但是，无论他怎样挣扎，他也逃不过这样一个必然的结局——人民意志的洪流将把他冲到历史的垃圾堆里去。（附图片）
