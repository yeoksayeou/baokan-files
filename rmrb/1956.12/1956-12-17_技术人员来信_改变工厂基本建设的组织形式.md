    Technical Personnel's Letter
    Changing the Organizational Form of Capital Construction in Factories
    Zhao Shuoqi, Harbin Turbine Factory
    The current organizational form of capital construction in factories and enterprises suffers from serious problems such as duplicated institutions, unclear responsibilities, and wasted manpower, and urgently needs to be improved. The capital construction of factories and enterprises mentioned here mainly refers to civil engineering projects such as factory buildings and roads and sewers within the factory area. Let's first understand the organizational form of civil engineering construction in general factories and enterprises.
    There are three parties involved in civil engineering construction: Party A, Party B, and Party C. Party A is the construction unit—the factory; Party B is the contractor—the civil engineering construction company; Party C is the design unit—the civil engineering design institute. In the construction process, the task of the design unit is relatively clear, and there are no problems at present, so Party C will not be discussed here. The specific person in charge of the construction work is Party B. Therefore, in addition to the linear system organization of the work area, work section, and team on the construction site, Party B also has a set of functional departments in charge of planning, technology, supply, finance, and technical supervision. This is completely necessary. The problem lies with Party A. Party A's task in the capital construction process is said to be "organization and supervision." Therefore, in order to "organize" Party B to complete the task, Party A has an Engineering Management Section (Department) and a Capital Construction Planning Section (Department); in order to supervise the quality of construction, Party A has a Technical Supervision Section (Department); in order to grasp Party B's material supply, Party A has a Capital Construction Materials Section (Department); in order to conduct "supervision" in finance, Party A also has a Capital Construction Finance Section (Department); there is even a Contract Budget Section specially prepared to deal with Party B; in order to deeply and concretely "organize and supervise," Party A also established site representative groups, site inspectors, and other organizations. Of course, in order to lead this huge organization, there must be leading cadres, so there are also institutions such as the Deputy Director in charge of Capital Construction and even the Capital Construction Office. The entire team often numbers several hundred people.
    Party A's main long-term task is production. Capital construction work is only a temporary task for Party A. According to normal business practices, Party A will not have, nor does it need, a large number of technical personnel who understand civil engineering construction. So, what is the source of personnel for Party A's huge capital construction organization? There are usually two methods: one is to mobilize some production personnel to change careers temporarily to engage in civil engineering construction; the other is to ask the state to squeeze out some civil engineering technical personnel to equip them. Of course, those who temporarily change careers are not only unfamiliar with the business but also inevitably have "ideological problems." Even Party A's professional personnel who study civil engineering often feel that working in a unit that does not directly engage in design and construction is a case of "having no opportunity to use their talents." Party A's capital construction work generally only lasts one or two years, and at most three or four years. Once the project is completed, this group of capital construction personnel has to be reassigned. Therefore, no matter how you slice it, all Party A's are fairly unprofessional new teams. Even though Party B's technical strength and business capabilities are far superior to Party A's, Party B still has to be "organized and supervised" by Party A, which is a problem that is difficult to truly understand ideologically on Party B's part.
    Let's set aside the issue of wasted manpower (of course, this issue cannot be ignored in practice). Does this dual organizational form really strengthen the construction force? In my opinion, in many cases, it not only does not strengthen it, but rather offsets the strength of both sides. For example, the construction operation plan and scheduling are originally purely internal matters for Party B. However, because Party A has site representatives and organizations such as the Capital Construction Planning Section and the Engineering Management Section, they have to interfere very specifically with Party B's operation plan. When problems occur during construction, Party A's organization also wants to make some adjustments, and as a result, Party A and Party B often disagree. If you want to do it this way, they want to do it that way. If they can't reach an agreement, they simply stop work and argue. In this way, Party B's independence in management is interfered with, and its initiative and enthusiasm are inevitably affected, and the construction period is often delayed instead. For example, ensuring quality is originally Party B's unshirkable responsibility, and Party B also has its own technical supervision organization, which is specifically responsible for checking the quality of construction. However, it seems that Party A does not trust Party B's inspection organization. It also has a Technical Supervision Section, which sends inspectors to the site to check the quality of each process, and whether it is good or bad, Party A's inspectors have the final say. In this way, Party B's inspection organization cannot establish prestige among the construction personnel. Generally speaking, it greatly weakens Party B's sense of responsibility, so that Party B is not responsible for quality issues on a conscious basis, but stands in opposition to Party A. The material problem is even worse. Party B was originally an all-powerful organization that contracted for both labor and materials. However, since Party A has a Materials Section, which wants to interfere with Party B's material problem, why doesn't Party B push the problem to Party A when it encounters difficulties? Because both parties are involved, the responsibility is unclear, and they rely on each other and shirk responsibility, which affects the active pursuit and timely resolution of material problems. For example, in dealing with rationalization proposals for construction, Party B is far stronger than Party A in terms of construction experience and technical management. However, all new creations and improvements in construction methods must be reviewed and approved by Party A. Party B cannot handle them quickly and in a timely manner, which affects its initiative and creativity. There are many other problems: such as the preparation of budgets and final accounts, the allocation of project funds, and the submission of various reports, which not only wastes a lot of manpower and material resources, but also often have different positions and endless disputes, which greatly affects the work, and seriously even drags the energy of leading cadres from construction management into this meaningless quagmire of man-made disputes, causing incalculable losses.
    It seems that I am speaking for Party B, but I am not an employee of a construction company. On the contrary, I am an engineer who has experienced the construction of two new factories and is engaged in production work. Many of the above arguments are indeed intended to redress grievances for Party B, but for Party A, is this kind of "organization and supervision" method beneficial to factory construction? No, definitely not. There are two problems here. On the one hand, because Party A interferes too much and manages too specifically, whether it is the progress of the project, quality issues, or material supply, Party A intervenes in Party B's business, and as a result, it becomes not a supervisor but one of the parties involved, and is instead passive everywhere and led by Party B. For example, if the project cannot be completed on time, it is either said that the materials responsible by Party A were not supplied as scheduled, or it is said that Party A did not adopt Party B's suggestions in a timely manner. If it is not handled well, Party A will have to compensate for the cost of delayed work and losses. On the other hand, because Party A has established such a huge organization, it will inevitably devote its main energy to this vortex during the construction period, thus neglecting the construction unit's own work—equipment preparation and production preparation. This is a lesson that has been repeatedly repeated by many new units.
    I believe that in the past few years, when we had no experience in the construction of factories and enterprises, it may have been necessary for the construction unit to establish a relatively complete capital construction organization to assist Party B in handling many specific problems. But today, when our construction team is already a regularized team with fully independent operating capabilities, maintaining this duplicate and overlapping form not only wastes manpower but also greatly hinders work. Since the engineering company is an independent business unit, Party A does not need to, and should not, participate in its operation and management or interfere with its operation plan. Since the engineering company is a state-owned enterprise, its technical supervision organization can and should, like the technical supervision organization in a production plant, be responsible to the state for quality issues. We know that it is not necessary, nor is it allowed, for each customer in a factory to send inspectors to check each process of each part. What reason do we have not to trust the engineering company's technical supervision organization and to check the construction quality? Since Party B contracts for both labor and materials, why does Party A still have to interfere with the materials? If Party A can streamline the huge organization one by one, a large number of civil engineering technical forces can enrich the engineering company's manpower. Party A's task is only to determine the completion date of the unit project, the project cost, and the technical conditions for project acceptance according to production needs, to be responsible for supplying technical data on time, to sign a contract with Party B, and to prepare for the acceptance force. Party B has the obligation to deliver projects with qualified quality within the time limit stipulated in the contract. If the progress is delayed or the quality does not meet the design requirements, Party B will not only bear political responsibility but also economic responsibility. As for the specific issues such as the operation plan during the construction process, on-site dispatch, material supply, budget preparation, and process inspection, they are entirely internal matters for Party B, and Party A does not need to, and has no right to, interfere. (A separate system can be established for the inspection of concealed works). This organizational form not only allows the current limited technical forces to be concentrated and used more effectively, but also allows the construction unit to fully exert its initiative and enthusiasm because the responsibility is clear and the command is unified, and the quality and progress of the project can be guaranteed more reliably. The construction unit can also get rid of the entanglement of businesses that are not within its professional scope and spend its main energy on production preparation work such as equipment, personnel, tools, materials, organization, system, and technical data.
    At the Eighth National Congress of the Party, Liu Xiufeng, Minister of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, had already raised this issue. From our experience, the current organizational form of civil engineering construction in factories and enterprises is very unreasonable, and we hope that it can be changed quickly. This will play a great role in saving manpower and material resources for construction, accelerating project progress, and improving quality.
    What is said above is limited to the organizational form of civil engineering construction. Although equipment installation also belongs to capital construction, it is very different from the nature of civil engineering construction. In installation projects, the construction unit cannot stand aside. This is not discussed in detail here, but it should be emphasized that equipment installation should not be confused with civil engineering construction, and the organizational form of civil engineering construction cannot be adopted for equipment installation.

    技术人员来信
    改变工厂基本建设的组织形式
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂　赵硕颀
    在当前工厂企业基本建设的组织形式上，存在着严重的机构重复、责任不明、人力浪费等不合理的现象，急待改进。这里所说的工厂企业的基本建设，主要是指厂房和厂区内的道路、上下水道等土建工程，让我们先了解一下一般工厂企业进行土木建筑工程的组织形式吧。
    同土木建筑工程有关的有甲、乙、丙三方。甲方是建设单位——工厂；乙方是承建单位——土木建筑工程公司；丙方是设计单位——土木建筑设计院。在施工过程中，设计单位的任务比较明确，目前也不存在什么问题，所以这里不谈丙方。具体负责施工工作的是乙方，因此乙方除了施工现场的一套工区工段、小组的直线系统组织以外，还有一套掌管计划、技术、供应、财务、技术监督等工作的职能部门，这是完全必要的。问题在于甲方，甲方在基本建设施工过程中的任务，据说是“组织监督”。因此，为了“组织”乙方来完成任务，甲方设有工程管理科（处）和基本建设计划科（处）；为了监督施工的质量，甲方设有技术监督科（处）；为了掌握乙方的物资供应，甲方设有基本建设材料科（处）；为了在财务上进行“监督”，甲方还设有基建财务科（处）；甚至还有专门准备与乙方打交道的合同预算科；为了深入具体地“组织监督”，甲方还设立工地代表组，工地检查员等组织。当然为了要领导这一套庞大的机构，必需要有领导干部，于是又有基建副厂长以至基本建设办公室等机构，整套人马往往多至好几百人。
    甲方长远的主要任务是生产，基本建设工作对甲方只是一段暂时性的任务，按照正常的业务性质，甲方根本不会有，也不需要有大批懂得土木建筑的技术人员。那么甲方这个庞大的基本建设机构的人员来源怎么办呢？通常有两个办法：一是动员一部分生产人员改行，临时搞土木建筑；一是要求国家挤出一部分土木建筑技术人员来配备。当然临时改行的人，不仅业务不熟，而且难免会有“思想问题”。就是甲方学土木建筑的专业人员，也往往觉得在一个不直接从事设计施工的单位内工作，有“英雄无用武之地”的想法。甲方的基本建设工作，一般只一、二年，长的也只三、四年，工程一结束，这批基本建设人员就得重新安排。因此乙方碰来碰去，所有的甲方，都是些相当外行的新班子。而尽管乙方的技术力量，业务能力远比甲方优越，却还得要甲方来“组织监督”，这是在乙方思想上很难真正搞通的问题。
    姑且避开浪费人力的问题不谈（当然实际上不能不考虑这个问题），是不是这样双重的组织形式真是加强了施工的力量呢？据我的看法，在很多问题上，不仅不是加强了，反而是相互抵消了力量。譬如说，施工作业计划和调度，本来纯粹是乙方内部的事，可是甲方因为设有工地代表和基建计划科、工程管理科等组织，它们就要很具体的来干涉乙方的作业计划。施工中发生了问题，甲方的机构也想来调度一番，结果常常甲乙双方意见不一，你要这样干，他要那样干。不得统一，就索性停下工来争论。这样乙方经营管理的独立性受到干涉，主动性积极性必然受到影响，工期反而往往拖延。譬如保证质量，本来是乙方责无旁贷的份内的事，乙方也有它自己的技术监督机构，专门负责施工质量的检查，可是看来甲方并不信任乙方的检查机构，它自己也有技术监督科，派有检查员在现场中检查每个工序的质量，而且说好说坏，最后还得甲方的检查员说了算。这样，乙方的检查机构在施工人员中就不可能建立威信。整个说来，也就是大大削弱了乙方的责任感，使得乙方在质量问题上，不是在自觉的基础上负责，而是同甲方站在对立的地位。材料问题上更糟糕，乙方本来是一个包工包料的全能机构，可是既然甲方设有材料科，它要过问乙方的材料问题，那么乙方在碰到困难时，为什么不往甲方身上推呢？因为两家都有份反而责任不明，互相依赖，互相推诿，影响了材料问题的积极争取，及时解决。再如在处理施工合理化建议的问题上，本来乙方不论在施工经验上和技术管理上都是远较甲方为强的单位，可是所有新的创造，施工方法上的改进，都要经过甲方审查同意，乙方不能迅速及时的处理，影响它的积极性和创造性的发挥。还有许多其他问题：如在预算和决算的编制上，工程款项的拨付上，各种表报的报送上，不仅浪费了大量的人力物力，而且往往立场不同，争论无休无止，大大的影响工作，严重的甚至将领导干部的精力也从施工管理上拖进这个毫无实际意义的人为纷争的泥潭中去，造成了不可估量的损失。
    看来，好像我在为乙方说话，可是我并不是一个工程公司的工作人员，相反的，我是个经历过两个新厂建设的、从事生产工作的工程师。上面的许多论点，的确我有为乙方鸣不平之意，可是对甲方来说，是不是这样的“组织监督”方式就有利于建厂工作呢？不是，肯定的不是。这里存在着两个问题，一方面因为甲方过问太多，管得太具体，不论工程进度也好，质量问题也好，材料供应也好，甲方都插手在乙方的业务中，结果弄成了不是个监督者而成为当事人之一，反而处处被动，给乙方牵着走。譬如工程到期交不了工，不是说甲方负责的材料没有如期供应，就是说甲方没有及时采纳乙方的建议，弄得不好还要甲方赔偿窝工费、损失费。另一方面，因为甲方既然建立了这样一个庞大的机构，必然在建厂时期会将主要精力投到这个漩涡中去，因而忽略了建设单位的本分工作——设备准备和生产准备，这已经是多少个新建单位一再重复的教训。
    我认为：在前几年，当我们对工厂企业的施工还是毫无经验的时候，建设单位成立一套比较完整的基本建设机构，来协助乙方处理许多具体问题，可能还是必要的。可是在今天，我们的建筑队伍已经是一支正规化的、完全具有独立经营能力的队伍的时候，保存这种重复叠置的形式，不仅浪费人力，而且还会大大地妨碍工作。既然工程公司是一个独立的企业单位，甲方就没有必要，也不应该再去参加它的经营管理，干预它的作业计划。既然工程公司是一个国家企业，它的技术监督机构也可以也应该像生产厂中的技术监督机构一样，在质量问题上对国家负责。我们知道工厂中没有必要，也不允许每个客户都派检查员去检查每个零件的每个工序，我们又有什么理由不信任工程公司的技术监督机构而要去检查施工质量呢？既然乙方包工包料，甲方为什么还要在材料上也去插一手呢？如果甲方能够将庞大的机构一一精简，大批的土木建筑技术力量就可以充实工程公司的人力，甲方的任务，只要根据生产需要，确定单位工程的完工日期、工程费用和工程验收的技术条件，负责按时供应技术资料，同乙方签订合同，准备好验收的力量。乙方则有按合同规定期限交出质量合乎要求的工程的义务，如有拖延进度或者质量不合设计要求，乙方不仅负政治上的责任，而且也负经济上的责任。至于施工过程中的作业计划，现场调度，材料供应，预算编制，工序检查等具体问题，那完全是乙方内部的事，甲方不必过问，也无权过问。（隐蔽工程的检查可以另订制度）。这样的组织形式，不仅当前有限的技术力量，可以集中起来，得到更有效的使用，而且施工单位因为责任明确，指挥统一，积极性主动性可以充分发挥，工程的质量和进度反而更能有可靠的保证，建设单位也可以摆脱一些不属于它的专业范围内的业务的纠缠，拿出主要的精力，花在设备、人员、工具、材料、组织、制度、技术资料等生产准备工作上去。
    在党的第八次代表大会上，建筑工程部刘秀峰部长已经提出过这个问题。从我们的体验来看，目前工厂企业的土木建筑组织形式是非常不合理的，我们希望能迅速加以改变。这对施工人力物力的节省，工程进度的加速和质量的提高将起很大的作用。
    上面所说的只限于土木建筑工程的组织形式，设备安装虽然也属于基本建设，但是同土木建筑施工的性质，有绝大的不同。在安装工程上，建设单位不能站在一边，这里没有详细讨论，只是要着重说明一点：不要将设备安装与土木建筑混为一谈，设备安装不能采用土木建筑的组织形式。
