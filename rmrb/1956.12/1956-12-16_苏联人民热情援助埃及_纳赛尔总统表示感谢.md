Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 15th: TASS reported that Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser received a delegation from the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Union on the 14th. This delegation brought medicines and food donated by the Soviet working people to the Egyptian people to Egypt.

President Nasser warmly welcomed the Soviet representatives. He said: "I am very happy to see you. I would like to take this opportunity to express the Egyptian people's gratitude to all the Soviet people through you for their assistance to us at this time.

"All the Egyptian people cherish this and have deep affection for the Soviet people. Please convey our thanks to the Soviet Red Cross for its assistance to the victims of aggression.

"Our goal is to improve the living standards of the people, and we will do so with confidence. For decades, our people have lived in the suffering of feudalism and colonialism. In order to improve living standards, an independent national economy must be established. However, if a country is not politically independent, it is impossible to establish an independent economy. When we had just declared our determination to strive for independence and freedom, the aggression began. The imperialist countries that have been strangling us for a long time are unwilling to let go. But we believe that we will achieve our goal."

    苏联人民热情援助埃及
    纳赛尔总统表示感谢
    新华社15日讯　塔斯社开罗讯：埃及总统加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔14日接见了苏联红十字会与红新月会联合会代表团。这个代表团把苏联劳动人民赠给埃及人民的药品和食品运到了埃及。
  纳赛尔总统向苏联代表表示热烈欢迎。他说：“看到你们，我感到很高兴，我愿意利用这个机会，通过你们向全体苏联人民表示埃及人民的感谢，感谢他们在这样的时候援助我们。
    “全体埃及人民都珍视这一点，并且对苏联人怀着深厚的情谊。请向苏联红十字会转达我们的谢意，感谢它对遭受侵略的人们的援助。
    “我们的目标是提高人民的生活水平，并且我们将满怀信心地做到这一点。数十年来，我国人民在封建主义和殖民主义的苦难中生活。为了提高生活水平，必须建立独立的国民经济。但是，如果一个国家在政治上不能独立自主，就不可能建立独立的经济。当我们刚刚声明决心争取独立和自由的时候，侵略就开始了。长期以来紧扼着我们脖子的帝国主义国家是不愿意放开手的。但是我们相信，我们一定会达到目的。”
