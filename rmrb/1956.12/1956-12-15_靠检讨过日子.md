    Living by Self-Criticism
    The working system of the Beijing Hepingli Post Office is unsound, and newspapers and periodicals are often not delivered on time. A reader subscribed to a magazine for half a year, but did not receive a single issue in the third quarter. When the reader raised their concerns, the post office sent them a mimeographed letter of self-criticism, but after the "self-criticism," the work remained the same as before.
    It is much easier to start a mimeograph machine than to improve work, no wonder they don't use their brains at work. (Zhang Hualing) (Attached picture)

    靠检讨过日子
    北京和平里邮局工作制度不健全，经常不按期投送报刊，一个读者订了半年杂志，第三季度一本没有收到。读者提出意见，他们就给读者送一份油印检讨书，但“检讨”之后，工作依然如故。
    开动一次油印机比改进工作容易得多，难怪他们不在工作上动脑筋了。　（张桦龄）（附图片）
