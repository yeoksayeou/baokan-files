    Discussing the Theory of Comprehensive Balance and the Law of Proportional Development in Connection with China's Reality

    (Continued from yesterday)
    VIII. Balance of Import and Export Trade
    Socialist commerce is divided into two parts: domestic and foreign. Therefore, when discussing commerce, one cannot avoid discussing foreign trade. At present, China's export goods are mainly agricultural and sideline products. Even many exported light industrial products require agricultural products as raw materials. As everyone knows, since China's chemical industry, especially the organic chemical industry, is not yet developed, about 90% or more of the raw materials for light industry rely on agriculture. The bumper or poor harvest of agriculture has a great impact not only on light industry but also a decisive impact on import and export trade. Therefore, how much material to import cannot be considered in isolation only from the needs of industrial construction. It should also be determined by the supply of export goods. It is also important to weigh the importance and urgency of various factors such as national construction needs, import possibilities, and foreign exchange situations, and consider them in a comprehensive balance. The so-called national construction needs refer to the import of complete sets of equipment and various important materials necessary for various constructions, especially heavy industry construction. However, to import how much heavy industrial material, we must first see how much agricultural and light industrial material is exported. Therefore, import and export trade is closely related to heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture. When preparing annual and long-term plans, national planning agencies should combine the import needs of various production constructions, the supply of export goods, and the needs of the domestic market as much as possible, and conduct a comprehensive and practical balance. Export goods should not be blindly exported too much, nor should they be exported too little. If too much is exported, it will cause difficulties in the supply of certain important commodities in the domestic market, fail to meet the immediate needs of the masses, cause price fluctuations, and thus affect the smooth progress of national industrialization, the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and the close ties between the Party and the masses. Conversely, if too little is exported, it will not guarantee the import needs of heavy industry construction, which will affect the progress of national industrialization, thereby harming the long-term interests of the masses and weakening the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance in the future. From this, it can be inferred that if the domestic demand is very tight and the export goods must be reduced, then the imported materials must also be reduced to ensure the balance of foreign exchange revenue and expenditure. Taking live pigs as an example, due to the increase in people's purchasing power and the increased demand for meat, there has been a shortage in the supply of pork. The commercial departments have taken measures to reduce pork exports to ease the current tension in the supply of meat in urban and rural areas. It can be seen that with the changing situation, an appropriate balance must be constantly sought between imports and exports. For example, by 1967, the total national cotton production will be doubled compared to the production in 1955. At that time, we can have yarn and cloth exports worth 1 to 2 billion yuan annually. Within twelve years, the total national grain production will reach more than one and a half times the current total production, part of which may be exported to exchange for industrial construction materials from foreign countries. At that time, a new balance will appear between import and export trade. Our research on balance theory must start from the perspective of development. Our actual life is developing in the contradiction between balance and imbalance. Our responsibility is to start from the perspective of development, take active measures, constantly discover new weaknesses, and constantly overcome new imbalances, so that the entire national economy can move step by step towards a new and higher level.
    IX. Balance of Accumulation and Consumption
    In the previous section, we said that the main export goods are still agricultural and sideline products and light industrial products. These materials are exported to foreign countries to exchange for means of production to develop China's heavy industry, and they are of course a form of capital accumulation.
    To complete the arduous task of China's socialist industrialization, we must have capital accumulation commensurate with it. The road to realizing capital accumulation can only rely on domestic accumulation, as determined by China's social system. The amount and speed of accumulation not only directly affect the speed of socialist industrialization but also directly affect the level of people's consumption and the degree of improvement in their lives. However, the sources of accumulation include not only export goods but also light industry, heavy industry, commerce, and agriculture. Light industry can accumulate funds for heavy industry, but heavy industry itself can also accumulate funds. The profits provided by Anshan Iron and Steel have greatly exceeded the total funds invested by the state in the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel. However, a large part of the funds is still derived from agriculture and commerce. Because farmers are the main body of China's industrial market and the source of grain and raw material supply, to accumulate funds, we must first rely on the development of agriculture. With the rapid development of agricultural cooperativization and the improvement of agricultural production, farmers' incomes have increased, and their purchasing power has increased. The amount of production materials they need, such as chemical fertilizers, tractors, seeders, water pumps, rubber-wheeled transportation tools, etc., and the amount of living materials they need, such as various kinds of cloth, bicycles, pens, flashlights, books, etc., is difficult to estimate, and this number will gradually increase with the development of industry and agriculture. If we can exchange farmers' continuously increasing agricultural products for continuously increasing industrial products, then we can meet the material needs of farmers, further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, maintain price stability, and at the same time increase tax revenue and profits for the state, which is also equivalent to accumulating a lot of funds for the state.
    As everyone knows, the sum of accumulation and consumption is equal to national income, and national income is the value of the total social product created by industrial, agricultural, construction, transportation serving production, and commercial workers, which is also commonly referred to as the total output value. Apart from the part used to compensate for the consumed means of production, the value of the remaining part of the social product is also commonly referred to as the net output value. This net output value, in socialist countries, is the entire national income, all owned by the working people themselves. The working people use part of the national income to maintain and improve their lives, that is, for consumption; another part is used for national economic construction, that is, for capital accumulation. When distributing and redistributing national income, the consumption part and the accumulation part must maintain an appropriate proportion. Why? Because we obtain a certain amount of capital accumulation from industry, commerce, and mainly from agriculture, for the great socialist construction and to create greater benefits for farmers and all working people, which is in line with the fundamental interests of the people. However, the speed of accumulation should not be too fast. If it is too fast, the material and cultural life of farmers cannot improve with the increase in labor productivity, or even declines, which will cause dissatisfaction among farmers, hinder the worker-peasant alliance, and also hinder the smooth progress of national construction. Of course, it cannot be too slow either. If it is too slow, it will hinder national industrialization and also hinder the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, there must be an accurate balance between accumulation and consumption. Our price policy, tax policy, wage policy, and cooperative income distribution policy should be able to ensure both the capital accumulation needed for socialist construction and the gradual improvement of people's lives. Therefore, we must make the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption in the national income properly handled. Therefore, the Party and the government have adopted the policy of "less deduction and more distribution" in the distribution of cooperative products, which is to
  "ensure the needs of collective production and take care of the needs of cooperative members' lives." The central government instructed that 60% to 70% of the total income of the cooperative should be distributed to the members, and strive to increase the income of 90% of the members. This is the specific policy boundary for achieving this policy at present. After the practice of the summer harvest distribution in 1956, it was proved that the central government's instructions were correct. This instruction reasonably solved the problem of farmers' income distribution. For national income (including income from various industries), the relationship between national interests and individual interests should be reasonably resolved, just like the income of agricultural cooperatives. According to the preliminary calculations of the Planning Commission on various indicators in the first five-year plan, after the distribution and redistribution of China's national income in the first five-year plan, the part ultimately used for accumulation accounted for about 22%, and the part used for consumption accounted for about 78%; compared with the Soviet Union's several five-year plans, the proportion of China's accumulation fund was lower than that of the Soviet Union (about 25% in the Soviet Union), and the proportion of consumption fund was higher than that of the Soviet Union (about 75% in the Soviet Union). Why is this so? Mr. Li Fuchun believes that this is because considering the factors such as China's large population and underdeveloped production, the proportion of accumulation fund can only be slightly lower. According to this proportion, it can guarantee the needs of national construction and also make the people's lives appropriately improved. As for the proportional relationship between accumulation and consumption in other five-year plans, Mr. Bo Yibo believes that in the next few years, under normal circumstances, the proportion of the accumulation part in China's national income should not be lower than 20%, or slightly higher. The proportion of state budget revenue in China's national income should not be lower than 30%, or slightly higher. The proportion of capital construction expenditure in China's state budget expenditure should not be lower than 40%, or slightly higher. He feels that these proportions are more in line with China's current economic situation and are more stable and reliable. But he does not say that these proportions are appropriate in any case. With the development of production, the increase of national income, and the further reduction of defense and administrative expenses, accumulation can be appropriately increased.
    In the Soviet Union, the ratio of accumulation to consumption is 25 to 75, while in China, it is 22 to 78. According to Mr. Bo Yibo's opinion, it should be 20 to 80, or slightly higher, which is of course largely due to China's large population and underdeveloped production. If we want to follow in the footsteps of the Soviet Union and increase the proportion to 25 to 75, we must gradually realize the modernization of agriculture, that is, electrification and mechanization, so that farmers can become rich. But without the development of heavy industry, it is impossible to fundamentally improve our agricultural technology, and it is impossible to achieve agricultural modernization. If agriculture is not modernized, the productivity of agriculture cannot be greatly improved. If agricultural productivity cannot be greatly improved, then the consumer goods industry does not need to advance and cannot advance. Because if it advances alone and agriculture cannot keep up, it cannot meet the needs of industry for grain, raw materials, and capital accumulation; even if industry has advanced, it will inevitably be forced to retreat. Furthermore, if agricultural productivity cannot be greatly improved, farmers cannot become rich quickly, and their purchasing power cannot be increased. If the consumer goods industry advances alone, it will inevitably commit the error of left-leaning adventurism. Therefore, the ratio of accumulation to consumption cannot be raised to the level of the Soviet Union (25 to 75). Everyone knows that we currently cannot have a large number of agricultural machines and chemical fertilizers, and it is impossible to reclaim wasteland on a large scale to expand the cultivated land area, because these all depend on the development speed of the steel industry. The amount of steel production is an important indicator to measure the level of national industry. Although the development speed of China's steel in the past few years has been quite fast, from the perspective of China's industrial construction, it is felt that the steel needed for industrial construction is now amazing. An average of 22,000 to 25,000 tons of steel is needed for 100 million yuan of construction and installation work; 180,000 to 190,000 tons of steel rails and steel are needed for 1,000 kilometers of railway. To build a strong mechanized industry in China, there must also be enough materials, first of all, steel. According to the actual data in the past few years, every 100 million yuan increase in the total output value of the machinery industry requires an average of about 15,000 tons of steel. Because of this reason, in the short term, we cannot have a large number of agricultural machines and chemical fertilizers, and it is impossible to reclaim wasteland on a large scale. Even if it is possible, the transportation capacity cannot keep up. Therefore, our current main way to increase agricultural production can only be to take various measures to increase production on the existing land to expand the multiple cropping index and increase the yield per unit area. At the same time, under possible conditions, try to reclaim some wasteland to expand the cultivated land area. This is the basic direction of current agricultural production increase. We have excellent natural conditions, abundant human resources, and traditional experience in intensive farming, which can be used to fully tap the huge potential power of the existing land. We have adopted various effective measures to increase production, such as: (1) building water conservancy; (2) preventing water disasters; (3) exploring fertilizer sources; (4) improving soil; (5) selecting good seeds; (6) promoting new agricultural tools; (7) preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests; (8) improving cultivation techniques; (9) changing the cultivation system, etc. After that, as long as we vigorously carry out these measures, we will be able to increase the multiple cropping index on the existing land and increase the yield per unit area to achieve the goal of increasing agricultural production.
    X. Mastering the Law of Proportional Development
    Mr. Bo Yibo believes that the proportion of capital construction expenditure in the state budget expenditure should not be lower than 40%, or slightly higher, which is suitable for the current economic situation. In 1956, capital construction expenditure accounted for 46.7% of the state budget expenditure. The purpose was to carry out more industrial construction so that China's industry, especially heavy industry, could be developed faster; but as a result, it was "more haste, less speed," which brought adverse consequences to the development of the national economy and caused the phenomenon of disconnection between accumulation and consumption. This is because the law of proportional development has not been well mastered. What are the so-called adverse consequences? The first adverse consequence is that the supply of building materials and equipment cannot keep up. Taking steel as an example, the development speed of China's steel industry has been quite fast in the past few years. The first five-year plan stipulates that China's steel production should be increased from 1.349 million tons in 1952 to 4.12 million tons in 1957, with an average annual growth of 25%. However, as a result of the implementation, it is expected to reach 5.5 million tons in 1957, with an average annual growth of 32.5%. The policy of developing the steel industry at a high speed is correct, and the conditions are also available. The problem is that the supply of pig iron, coke, and refractory materials cannot keep up. The utilization rate of steel-making open-hearth furnaces has increased very quickly, but the iron-making in front of it cannot keep up, and the steel rolling behind it cannot keep up, which also hinders the more rapid increase of steel-making capacity. This is due to the lack of comprehensive research and comprehensive balance, resulting in the failure of various links to connect. In capitalist countries, if pig iron, coke, and refractory materials are in short supply, their prices will automatically rise. After the prices rise, production will naturally increase, and the law of value will automatically play its regulatory role here. But here, these things are all in the hands of the state, and the state has the right to control them. As long as it is carried out in accordance with the law of proportional development, there is no need for the law of value to do it for it. The state can use this law to achieve the intended purpose, but it cannot automatically play its role. The problem here lies in whether the balance work is comprehensive or not. This example clearly points out that what dominates this balance work is not the law of value (nothing more than using the law of value as a supplement), but the law of proportional development, but the work has not been fully arranged according to this law. This is probably due to the fact that we are still in the transition period, with insufficient experience and insufficient foresight. The second adverse consequence is that the transportation capacity cannot keep up. The reason is the sharp increase in transportation volume. For example, the volume of freight transport completed by railways, operating vehicles, and civil aviation in 1956 is expected to be close to or exceed the level stipulated in the first five-year plan in 1957, and the newly added transportation lines and equipment cannot keep up with the rising speed of transportation volume. At the same time, the comprehensive utilization of various transportation tools is not well organized, and unreasonable transportation phenomena such as duplication, counter-flow, over-transportation, and roundabout still exist, which further increases the tension of transportation. According to the requirements of socialist economic planned (proportional) development, the transportation industry must be developed accordingly while focusing on the development of heavy industry. If only capital industrial construction is considered and the transportation industry is ignored, then the construction cannot be carried out smoothly due to the lack of corresponding transportation conditions. For example, in terms of freight transport, the utilization of the passing capacity of Beijing-Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan, and the western section of the Longhai Line has reached saturation, so freight cars are often backlogged, stations are blocked, and even transportation tasks cannot be completed. In terms of passenger transport, passengers often cannot buy tickets and cannot find seats on the train. What plays a role here is not the law of value, but the law of proportional development. From this, it can be seen the importance of the law of proportional development, and our construction work must be carried out according to this law. To do this work well, first, it must be based on the Party's general line and various policies, and the key points and the overall situation must be combined. Ignoring the key points or weakening the egalitarianism of the key points, or the isolationism of only focusing on the key points and ignoring other things, and the local ideas that excessively emphasize one aspect or one region, are all contrary to the Party's policies and are harmful to the proportional development of the national economy.
    We must know that the various aspects of the national economy are an organically combined whole, and there must be a law of proportional development among them. We must thoroughly study this law, comprehensively understand the economic situation, and foresee the development trends of various aspects, departments, and links, so that we can make a good overall arrangement when determining plan indicators for various economic components, and connect the various departments and regions of the national economy within a national plan. This work is extremely difficult and meticulous, and can be described as having thousands of threads, intricate and complex. If the actual economic situation is not well understood, it is difficult to set appropriate indicators, and some uneven phenomena of being loose first and then tight, and sometimes loose and sometimes tight, will inevitably occur in the process of plan execution. But it should be noted that although we must correctly grasp the law of proportional development of the national economy, the determined proportion is not a rigid formula. Under different economic conditions, there must be different degrees of proportional relationship; only by repeatedly balancing calculations based on actual needs and possibilities can we more appropriately stipulate the proportional relationship between various aspects of the national economy, and we must also revise and supplement it in practice.
    In this section, there are two prominent points that need to be studied further:
    (A) Is there any way to remedy the problem of "not keeping up" with the supply of materials?
    (B) Here, what dominates our planning work is the law of proportional development, not the law of value, but we must use the law of value to achieve the goal of supply and demand balance. The question is how to use it.
    Now, let me explain in two sections.
    (A) Balance of Material Supply and Material Reserve
    This problem of "not keeping up" can be partially remedied by the method of material reserve. In socialist construction, especially in the case of insufficient experience, the phenomenon of the supply of building materials and equipment not keeping up, as mentioned above, will of course occur frequently. This is due to the failure to fully arrange according to the law of proportional development. Therefore, in terms of capital construction, not enough attention is paid to the connection of various links such as survey, design, supply of equipment and materials, etc., so waste phenomena such as suspension of work waiting for drawings, suspension of work waiting for materials, rushing work, and idling often occur on some construction sites. In the process of plan execution, there will also be some uneven phenomena of being loose first and then tight, and sometimes loose and sometimes tight. Therefore, we must maintain the necessary reserves of materials, finance, mineral resources, and production capacity, especially to increase the state's material reserves, to ensure the balanced development of the national economy and the smooth progress of the annual plan, and also to cope with unexpected difficulties that may be encountered. The following three examples can clarify this point. The first is the coal industry. When calculating the amount of coal needed, we must fully consider the possibility that the over-planned development of other industries is greater than the possibility of the over-planned development of the coal industry. Therefore, when stipulating the production level of the coal industry, we must maintain a certain reserve production capacity and establish a national coal reserve system. When considering the construction scale of the coal industry, we must make the construction scale compatible with the requirements for the production level of the coal industry. At the same time, because the construction period of the mine is long, it is impossible to solve the extremely tense situation of coal supply falling short of demand that has already formed by adding projects in the annual plan. The second example is the production of several materials such as steel, cement, and pig iron. In the past, the balance work of some departments was not done well enough, and the idea of comprehensively completing the state plan was not fully implemented in actual work. Even if the balance work was done relatively well at that time, new imbalances may have occurred due to unforeseen factors. For example, the reduction in agricultural production in 1954 affected the production of some industries and reduced capital construction. Therefore, in 1955, there was some surplus of several materials such as steel, cement, and pig iron. The production departments requested the Ministry of Foreign Trade to export these surplus materials to avoid backlog and support production. After the arrival of the socialist upsurge at the beginning of this year, these materials were not enough due to the surge in demand (felt that they could not keep up), and the Ministry of Foreign Trade was required to change the originally determined export plan midway. As a result, it may affect the execution of foreign contracts and the state's credibility to foreign countries, and also affect the completion of the import plan for basic industrial construction. If the temporarily false phenomenon of surplus materials had been left as material reserves, the phenomenon of "not keeping up" would not have occurred. The third example is capital construction. In the past few years, a relatively strong construction team has been cultivated in capital construction. By the first quarter of 1956, the total number of employees in the national construction and installation sector had reached 1.41 million. After practical work, they have mastered some new technologies. Many comprehensive construction companies that could only be suitable for general civil buildings in the past have become various professional engineering companies. Therefore, many advanced experiences have emerged in the construction and construction departments, the speed of construction and installation has been continuously accelerated, the construction period has been continuously shortened, and labor productivity has been greatly improved. For example, in terms of power station construction, the time from the start of construction to the commissioning of the first unit of two 25,000 kW power generation equipment in the past was 25 months; now, it only takes 16 to 18 months to build a power station of the same scale. In terms of coal mine construction, the construction period of a large vertical shaft can be shortened by half a year to a year after improving the construction methods. However, the design work, the production of building materials, and machinery and equipment cannot advance at the same speed, and cannot meet the requirements of the continuous shortening of the construction period of construction and construction. This has formed many uncoordinated situations in the basic construction plan, which is the situation of "not keeping up." Therefore, waste phenomena such as suspension of work waiting for drawings, suspension of work waiting for materials, rushing work, and idling often occur on some construction sites, and even some projects cannot be completed on schedule. This shows that formulating a national economic plan is a very difficult and meticulous work. In the initial stage of lack of experience, shortcomings are difficult to avoid. Later, as experience becomes richer and research becomes deeper, the planning work will definitely become more and more accurate. There is no doubt about this. At present, these shortcomings can be made up for by reserve power. Therefore, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has proposed a batch of reserve construction projects at the same time as proposing formal construction projects this year. The purpose is to replace it with reserve projects when some projects in the original plan cannot be carried out according to the plan. For some engineering projects that cannot be built according to the original plan time due to design and equipment reasons, preparations are made to reduce or postpone them, and those reserve engineering projects with available conditions are transferred to the formal plan. In this way, it may reduce the difficulties of incoordination between materials, equipment, design, and construction, and can make basic construction proceed more smoothly, while ensuring the completion of the total workload of basic construction in 1956.
    (B) Balance of Commodity Production and Commodity Distribution (Supply and Demand Balance)
    Here, let me talk about how we use the law of value to achieve the goal of supply and demand balance. Recently, cadres and workers from all over the country have written to the Ministry of Finance, asking why the policy of generally reducing the prices of industrial products every year is not adopted, but the policy of basically stabilizing the prices of industrial products is adopted? The main reason is that the conditions for generally reducing the prices of industrial products do not objectively exist. Because our chemical industry, especially the organic chemical industry, is not yet developed, light industrial products cannot be free from the restrictions of agricultural raw materials. Except for a very small number of industrial products, there is not an oversupply, but a short supply. Under this circumstance, if the policy of generally reducing the prices of industrial products is adopted, serious out-of-stock phenomena will inevitably occur. The result is either forced to raise prices again, or people cannot buy things, black markets appear, and the price system is destroyed; or the state is forced to increase the proportion of consumption funds and reduce the proportion of accumulation funds. Doing so will inevitably hinder the speed of heavy industry construction and break the balance between accumulation and consumption. In the final analysis, price reduction is just empty talk. In 1953, there was a time when prices were reduced for sale, but as a result, many commodities were out of stock and had to be raised again. This is our valuable lesson.
    There are indeed two ways to stimulate production to improve people's lives: one is to reduce prices and increase sales, as proposed by cadres and workers in various places; the other is to increase workers' wages and appropriately increase the purchase prices of certain agricultural and sideline products. Which method to adopt depends on the specific circumstances at that time. If there are enough raw materials and sufficient equipment to ensure the full supply of commodities, then it is right to adopt the first method. Conversely, if there is a shortage of raw materials and it is difficult to expand equipment for a while, and the supply of sufficient commodities cannot be guaranteed, only the second method can be adopted. If the prices are blindly reduced regardless of all conditions, the result will not be price reduction and increased sales, but price reduction and out of stock. In the past few years, the purchasing power of the people in our country has increased, and the supply of commodities in the market can generally adapt to the needs of the market. There is basically no black market in the industrial product market, and there is basically no panic buying phenomenon except for individual short-supplied non-staple foods. This fully shows that the government's policy of basically stabilizing the prices of industrial products is correct. This also fully shows that the production and distribution of commodities are balanced under stable commodity prices. Here, it can be seen how we use the law of value to serve socialist construction. The price increase and price reduction here are artificial, not like in capitalist countries, where the automatic rise and fall of prices dominate the increase and decrease of production; here, not only can prices not dominate the increase and decrease of production, but prices themselves are controlled by people. We are nothing more than using prices to maintain the balance between commodity production and commodity distribution. Everyone knows that the various consumer goods produced by our socialist state-owned enterprises must reach consumers through the way of buying and selling. If there is buying and selling, there must be currency; if there is currency, there must be prices. Whether the prices set by people are reasonable or not can determine whether the buying and selling are established, whether the production and distribution are balanced, and can also determine whether the commodities are backlogged or out of stock.
    XI. Conclusion
    I have said in the previous section that the various aspects, departments, and regions of the national economy are an organically combined whole. To do a good job in planning, we must first master the law of proportional development, and then combine the key points and the overall situation according to this law. It is wrong to only consider the key points and ignore other isolationist ideas; it is also wrong to emphasize several aspects and several regions and ignore other aspects and other regions. It violates the law of proportional development. In this paper, due to space limitations, I only talked about a few links, and did not talk about the various aspects in each link. For example, industry is a link. The various aspects in this link should also be talked about in order to be called a comprehensive and balanced theory. In addition to heavy industry and light industry, industry also includes the balance between coastal industry and inland industry, the balance between original industry and newly built industry, the balance between raw material industry and processing industry, the balance between construction scale and geological resources, the balance between large-scale industry and small and medium-sized industry, the balance between central industry and local industry, and the balance between state-owned industry and joint state-private industry, etc. Due to space limitations, I will not talk about them here, and I plan to write another article to discuss them in detail.

    联系中国实际来谈谈综合平衡理论和按比例发展规律
    马寅初
    （续昨日）
    八、进口贸易和出口贸易的平衡
    社会主义商业分国内和国外两部，因此，讨论商业时，不能不连带讨论国外贸易。目前，我国出口物资主要是农副产品，就是出口的许多轻工业品也需要用农产品作原料。大家知道，由于我国化学工业特别是有机化学工业还不发达，轻工业的原料，大约有90％以上要依靠农业。农业的丰收或歉收不仅对轻工业有很大的影响，对进出口贸易，也有决定性的影响。因此，进口多少物资，不能孤立地只从工业建设的需要来考虑，还应该看出口货源供应情况如何而定，而按照国家建设需要、进口可能和外汇情况等各方面因素，权衡轻重缓急加以综合平衡来考虑，也是重要的问题。所谓国家建设需要是指各项建设首先是重工业建设所必需的成套设备和各种重要物资的进口来说的。但要进口多少重工业物资，得先看出口多少农业和轻工业物资，因此进出口贸易，是和重工业、轻工业和农业有密切的关系的。国家计划机构在编制年度和长期计划时，应当将各项生产建设的进口需要、出口货源的供应和国内市场的需要尽可能结合起来，全面地、切实地予以综合平衡。出口货源不能盲目地出口得过多，也不能出口得太少。如果出口得太多，就会引起国内市场上某些重要商品的供应发生困难，不能满足群众的眼前需要，就会引起物价的波动，从而影响到国家工业化的顺利进行，工农联盟的巩固，以及党和群众的密切联系。反之，如果出口得太少，就不能保证重工业建设物资的进口需要，那就会影响到国家工业化的进度，从而损害了群众的长远利益，削弱了今后工农联盟进一步的巩固。由此推知，如因国内需要很紧张，出口货源必须减少一些，则进口物资亦必减少一些，以保证外汇收支平衡。以生猪为例，由于人民购买力的提高而增加了肉类的需要量，出现了猪肉供应量的紧张情况，商业部门就采取减少猪肉出口的办法来和缓目前城乡肉类供应的紧张程度。由此可见，随着情况的变化，进出口间必须经常求得一个适当的平衡。例如，到1967年，全国棉花的总产量将比1955年的产量增加两倍。那时，我们可以年有价值一、二十亿元的纱布出口。在十二年内，全国粮食总产量要达到目前总产量的一倍半以上，其中一部分或者可以出口去向外国交换工业建设物资，那时的进出口贸易之间又会出现一个新平衡。我们研究平衡理论，必须从发展的观点出发。我们实际的生活正是在平衡和不平衡的矛盾中发展的。我们的责任，就是要从发展的观点，采取积极的措施，不断地发现新的薄弱环节，不断地克服新的不平衡，使整个国民经济一步一步地走向新的较高的水平。
    九、积累和消费的平衡
    我们在前节说，出口物资主要的还是农副产品和轻工业品。这些物资输出国外去交换生产资料来发展我国的重工业，它们当然就是变形的资金积累。
    我们要完成我国的社会主义工业化的艰巨任务，就必须要有和它相适应的资金积累。而实现资金积累的道路，由于我国社会制度所决定，只能依靠国内积累。积累的多少和快慢，不仅直接影响到社会主义工业化的速度，而且也直接影响到人民的消费水平和生活改善的程度。但积累的来源除出口物资外，还有轻工业、重工业、商业和农业。轻工业是能为重工业积累资金的，但重工业本身也未尝不可以积累资金。鞍钢所提供的利润就大大超过了国家建设鞍钢的全部资金。但很大一部分的资金毕竟是从农业和商业中得来的。因为农民是我国工业市场的主体，是粮食和原料的供应来源，我们要积累资金，首先要依靠农业的发展。随着农业合作化迅速的发展和农业生产的提高，农民的收入增多了，购买力提高了，他们所需要的生产资料如化学肥料、拖拉机、播种机、抽水机、胶轮运输工具等等，生活资料如各色各样的布匹、自行车、钢笔、电筒、书籍等等，其数量之大，难以估计，而这个数字随着工农业的发展而逐步增加。如果我们能以继续不断增长的工业品去交换农民的继续不断增长的农产品，那么，我们就能满足农民的物质需要，进一步地巩固工农联盟，保持物价的稳定，同时又能为国家增加税收和取得利润，而这也等于为国家积累不少的资金。
    大家知道，积累和消费二者加起来也等于国民收入，而国民收入就是工业、农业、建筑业、服务于生产的运输业、商业工作者所创造的社会总产品的价值，也就是常说的总产值。除去用来补偿已消耗的生产资料的那一部分外，剩下的另一部分社会产品的价值，也就是常说的净产值。这个净产值，在社会主义国家里，就是全部的国民收入，都归劳动人民自己所有。劳动人民把国民收入的一部分用来维持和改善自己的生活，就是说用作消费；另一部分用于国家经济建设，也就是说用作资金积累。在分配和再分配国民收入的时候，必须使消费部分和积累部分保持适当的比例。为什么呢？因为我们从工业、商业、主要从农业方面取得一定的资金积累，是为了伟大的社会主义建设，是为了给农民和所有劳动人民创造更大的福利，这是符合人民的根本利益的。但是积累的速度不能太快。太快了，农民的物质和文化生活不能随着劳动生产率的提高而提高，甚至反而降低了，那就会引起农民的不满，妨碍工农联盟，也会妨碍国家建设事业的顺利前进。当然也不能太慢，太慢了，就会妨碍国家工业化，也同样会妨碍工农联盟。所以积累和消费之间，一定要有一个准确的平衡。我们的物价政策、税收政策、工资政策和合作社收益的分配政策，应当既能保证社会主义建设所需要的资金积累，又能保证人民生活的逐步改善。因此，我们必须使国民收入中积累和消费的比例关系得到一个适当的处理。所以，党和政府在合作社产品分配方面采取了“少扣多分”的方针，就是要
  “既保证集体生产需要，又照顾社员生活需要”的方针。中央指示：要把合作社总收入的60％到70％分配给社员，争取90％的社员能够增加收入，这是当前实现这条方针的具体的政策界限。经过1956年夏收分配的实践，证明中央的指示是正确的。这个指示合理地解决了农民收入的分配问题。对于国民收入（包括各业的收入），也是与农业社的收入一样，要合理地解决国家利益和个人利益的关系问题。根据计划委员会对第一个五年计划中各项指标的初步计算，我国第一个五年计划中的国民收入，经过分配和再分配后，最终用于积累的部分约占22％，用于消费的部分约占78％；同苏联几个五年计划相比，我国积累基金所占的比例较苏联低（苏联大约为25％左右），而消费基金所占的比例则比苏联高（苏联大约为75％左右）。为什么要这样呢？李富春先生认为，这是因为考虑到我国人多、生产不发达等因素，积累基金的比例只能稍低一些。而按照这一比例，既可以保证国家建设的需要，也可以使人民的生活得到适当的改善了。至于其他五年计划的积累和消费的比例关系，薄一波先生认为，在今后若干年内，在通常情况之下，我国国民收入中积累部分的比重，不要低于20％，或者略高一点。我国国民收入中国家预算收入的比重，不要低于30％，或者略高一点。我国国家预算支出中，基本建设支出的比重不要低于40％，或者略高一点。他觉得这些比例是比较符合我国当前的经济状况的，是比较稳妥可靠的。但他不说这些比例在任何情况下都是妥当的。随着生产的发展，国民收入的增加，国防费用和行政费用进一步的节减，积累是可以适当地提高的。
    在苏联，积累和消费的比例为二十五比七十五，而我国，则为二十二比七十八。而依薄一波先生的意见应为二十比八十，或者稍高一些，这当然大致是由于我国人多、生产不发达所致。如果我们要力步苏联的后尘，把比例提高到二十五比七十五，我们就必须逐步实现农业的现代化，即电气化和机械化，使农民富裕起来。但如果没有重工业的发达，就不可能从根本上改进我们的农业技术，就不可能达到农业现代化。农业不现代化，农业的生产力不容易大大地提高，农业生产力既不能大大地提高，则消费品工业亦不必前进且无法前进。因为如果单独前进而农业跟不上，不能满足工业对于粮食、原料、资金积累的需要；工业即已前进，亦必被迫后退。进一步说，农业生产力既不能大大地提高，农民亦不能很快地富裕起来，其购买力亦不能增大，如消费品工业孤独地前进，不免犯左倾冒险主义的错误。故积累与消费的比例不能提高到苏联的水平（二十五比七十五）。谁都知道，我们目前还不可能有大批的农业机器和化学肥料，不可能大规模地垦荒来扩大耕田面积，因为这些都取决于钢铁工业的发展速度。钢铁生产的多寡，是衡量国家工业水平高低的一个重要标志。虽在过去几年中，我国钢铁的发展速度是相当快的，但从我国工业建设角度来看，则觉得现在工业建设所需要的钢铁是惊人的。一亿元建筑安装工作量平均需要钢材二点二到二点五万吨；一千公里的铁路需要钢轨和钢材十八到十九万吨。我国要建设强大的机械化工业，也必须要有足够材料，首先是钢铁。根据过去几年来的实际资料，机械工业每提高一亿元的生产总值，平均需要钢材一点五万吨左右。因为这个缘故，在短期内，我们还不可能有大批的农业机器和化学肥料，不可能大规模地来垦荒，即使可能，运输能力也跟不上。因此，我们目前增加农业生产的主要途径，只能在现有的土地上采取各种增产措施来扩大复种指数，提高单位面积产量。同时，在可能条件下，尽可能开垦一些荒地以扩大耕田面积。这就是当前农业增产的基本方向。我们有优厚的自然条件，充沛的人力资源，精耕细作的传统经验，正可以来充分地挖掘现有土地的巨大的潜在力量。我们已经采用了行之有效的各种增产措施，如：（一）兴修水利；（二）防止水患；（三）发掘肥源；（四）改良土壤；（五）选用良种；（六）推广新式农具；（七）防除病虫害；（八）改进耕作技术；（九）改变耕作制度等等。此后，我们只要用大力进行这些措施，一定能够在现有土地上增加复种指数，提高单位面积产量，来达到农业增产的目的。
    十、按比例发展规律的掌握
    薄一波先生认为国家预算支出中基本建设支出的比重，不要低于40％，或者略高一些，是适合于当前经济情况的。1956年基本建设支出占国家预算支出的46.7％，其目的在于想更多地搞一些工业建设，使我国工业特别是重工业能够得到更快的发展；但结果，反而“欲速则不达”，给国民经济的发展带来了不良的后果，使积累和消费之间发生脱节的现象。这是由于没有好好地掌握按比例发展规律的缘故。所谓不良的后果是什么呢？第一个不良的后果是建筑材料和设备的供应跟不上。以钢铁为例，我国钢铁工业的发展速度，在过去几年是相当快的。第一个五年计划中规定我国钢的产量要从1952年的一百三十四点九万吨，提高到1957年的四百一十二万吨，每年平均增长25％。但执行的结果，到1957年预计可以达到五百五十万吨，每年平均增长32.5％。高速度发展钢铁工业的方针是对的，条件也是具备的，问题是在于生铁、焦炭和耐火材料的供应跟不上。炼钢平炉的利用率提高得很快，但是它前面的炼铁跟不上，后面的轧钢跟不上，这也就妨碍了炼钢能力更迅速的提高。这是由于缺乏综合的研究和综合的平衡，以致发生各个环节不能衔接所致。在资本主义国家里，如生铁、焦炭、耐火材料供不应求，它们的价格一定自动地上涨，上涨之后，生产自然增加，价值规律在此自动地起其调剂作用。但在我们这里，这些东西都掌握在国家手中，国家有权可以支配，只要切实依照按比例发展规律进行，用不着价值规律来代劳。国家可以利用这个规律来达到预定的目的，它不能自动地起其作用。在我们这里的问题，乃在于平衡工作做得全面不全面的问题。这个例子，明显地指出支配这个平衡工作，不是价值规律（无非利用价值规律作为一个补助），而是按比例发展的规律，不过工作没有全面地按这个规律安排而已。这大抵是由于我们尚在过渡时期，经验不足，预见性不够所致。第二个不良的后果是运输力量跟不上。原因在于运量的急剧增长，如铁路、营业汽车和民用航空，1956年预计完成的货运量将接近或超过第一个五年计划规定的1957年的水平，又加以新增的运输线路和设备跟不上运量上涨的速度。同时，各种运输工具的综合利用组织得还不够好，重复、对流、过运、迂回等不合理运输的现象仍然存在，这就更增加了运输的紧张程度。按照社会主义经济有计划（按比例）发展的要求，必须在以发展重工业为中心的同时，相应地发展运输业。若只顾基本工业建设而不顾运输业，则大建设由于没有相适应的交通运输条件，建设就不能顺利进行。例如在货运方面，如北京至郑州、石家庄至太原和陇海线西段的通过能力的利用已达饱和点，所以常常发生货车积压、车站堵塞，甚至有完不成运输任务的情况。在客运方面，则常常发生旅客买不到票，上车找不到座位等现象。在这里起作用的也不是价值法则，乃是按比例发展规律。由此可以看出按比例发展规律的重要，我们的建设工作必须按此规律进行。要作好这一工作，第一必须以党的总路线和各项方针政策为依据，使重点和全面相结合，忽视重点或削弱重点的平均主义思想，或只顾重点不顾其它的孤立主义思想，和过分强调一个方面、一个地区的局部思想，都是同党的方针政策相违背的，对国民经济按比例的发展也是有害的。
    我们要知道，国民经济的各个方面是一个有机地结合着的整体，其中一定有一个按比例发展的规律。我们要透彻地研究这个规律，要全面地了解经济情况，要预见各个方面、各个部门、各个环节的发展趋势，才能对各种经济成份在确定计划指标时，做出一个好的统筹安排工作，把国民经济的各部门各地区联系在一个国家计划之内。这个工作异常艰巨细致，可谓千头万绪，错综复杂。若对实际经济情况了解得不够而要定出适当的指标，是很难的，势必在计划执行的过程中，产生一些前松后紧、时松时紧的不均衡现象。但要注意，虽然我们要正确地掌握国民经济按比例发展的规律，但是所定的比例，并不是呆板的公式，在不同的经济情况下，必然有程度不同的比例关系；只有根据实际需要和可能，进行反复的平衡计算，才能比较恰当地规定出国民经济各方面的比例关系，而且要在实践中加以修正补充。
    在这一节中有下列突出两点，要再加以研究：
    （甲）这个物资供应“跟不上”的毛病，有无补救的方法？
    （乙）在我们这里，支配我们计划工作的是按比例发展规律，并不是价值规律，但是我们却要利用价值规律来达到供销平衡的目的，问题是如何利用它。
    现在分两段加以说明。
    （甲）物资供应和物资储备的平衡
    这个“跟不上”的毛病，一部分可以用物资储备的方法来补救。在社会主义的建设中，尤其在经验不足的情况下，如上所说的建筑材料和设备的供应跟不上的现象，当然会时常发生的。这是由于没有全面地按比例发展规律安排所致。因此，在基本建设方面，对于勘察、设计、供应设备和材料等各个环节的衔接注意得不够，因而在某些工地上经常发生停工待图、停工待料、赶工窝工等浪费现象。在计划执行过程中，也会产生一些前松后紧、时松时紧的不均衡现象。因此，我们必须保持必要的物资、财政、矿产资源、生产能力等的后备力量，特别要增加国家的物资储备，以保证国民经济的均衡发展和年度计划的顺利进行，并且还可以应付可能遇到的意外的困难。下列三个例子可以说清楚这一点。第一是煤炭工业。在计算煤炭需要量的时候，必须充分考虑到其它工业超计划发展的可能性大于煤炭工业超计划发展的可能性。因此，在规定煤炭工业的生产水平时，必须要保有一定的后备生产能力，并建立国家对煤炭的储备制度。在考虑到煤炭工业的建设规模时，必须使建设规模和对煤炭工业生产水平的要求相适应。同时，由于矿井的建设时期长，想在年度计划中用追加项目的办法，来解决已经形成的煤炭供不应求的极度紧张情况是不可能的。第二个例子是钢材、水泥、生铁等几种物资的生产。在过去，有些部门的平衡工作做得不够好，全面完成国家计划的思想还没有在实际工作中完全贯彻执行。即使平衡工作当时做得比较好，也可能由于难以预料的因素，又产生了新的不平衡。例如1954年农业的减产影响了某些工业生产，削减了基本建设，因而1955年的钢材、水泥、生铁等几种物资有些剩余，生产部门要求对外贸易部把这些剩余物资出口，以免积压并支持生产。今年初，社会主义高潮到来后，这几种物资又因需要激增而感到不够（感到跟不上），又要求对外贸易部把已经定了的出口计划中途变更。结果就可能影响对外合同的执行和国家对外的信誉，同时也影响基本工业建设进口计划的完成。假若当初把一时虚假现象的剩余物资留作物资后备，就不致有“跟不上”这样的现象发生。第三个例子是基本建设。几年来，在基本建设方面，已培养出了一支比较强大的建筑队伍，到1956年第一季度，全国建筑安装方面的职工总数已经达到一百四十一万人。他们经过实际工作的锻炼，掌握一些新的技术。过去许多只能适合于一般民用建筑的综合性的建筑公司，已成了各种专业的工程公司。因此，建筑施工部门出现了很多先进经验，建筑安装的速度不断地加快，工期就不断地缩短，劳动生产率大大地提高了。比如在电站建设方面，过去安装两台二万五千瓩的发电设备，从开工到第一台机组投入生产的时间是二十五个月；现在建设一个同样规模的电站，时间只用十六到十八个月。在煤矿建设方面，建设一个大型立井，在改进了施工方法之后，工期可以缩短半年到一年。但是设计工作、建筑材料和机器设备的生产，不能以同样的速度齐头并进，不能适应建筑施工的工期不断缩短的要求，这样就形成了许多基本建设计划中很不协调的情况，就是“跟不上”的情况。因而在某些工地上经常发生停工待图、停工待料、赶工窝工等浪费现象，甚至造成某些工程不能按期竣工的现象。这说明了制定国民经济计划是一件非常艰巨细致的工作。在初期缺乏经验的情况下，缺点是很难避免的。以后经验越来越丰富，研究越来越深刻，计划工作定必越来越准确。这是无可怀疑的。在目前可以用后备力量来弥补这些缺点。因此冶金工业部今年在提出正式建设工程项目的同时，又提出了一批后备工程项目。目的是为了在原计划中某些工程不能按计划进行的时候，可以用后备工程去代替它。对于有些由于设计和设备的原因，确实不能按原计划的时间进行建设的工程项目，准备加以削减或推迟，而把那些条件具备的后备工程项目，转入正式计划。这样就可能减少材料、设备、设计和施工之间不相协调的困难，并可使基本建设比较顺利地进行，同时又保证完成1956年基本建设总的工作量。
    （乙）商品生产和商品分配的平衡（供销平衡）
    在这里让我来谈谈我们如何利用价值规律来达到供销平衡的目的。近来，各地干部和职工纷纷向财政部去信，问为什么不采取每年普遍降低工业品价格的方针，而采取基本稳定工业品价格的方针？主要原因是在于普遍降低工业品的条件，客观上还不存在。因为我们化学工业尤其是有机化学工业还不发达，轻工业品不能不受着农业原料的限制。除了极少数工业品以外，不是供过于求，乃是供不应求。在这种情况下，如果采取普遍降低工业品价格的方针，势必发生严重的脱销现象，其结果不是被迫重新提高价格，便是人民买不到东西，出现黑市，破坏物价制度；或者国家被迫增加消费部分资金的比例，减少积累部分资金的比例，这样做势必妨碍重工业建设的速度，打破积累与消费的平衡。归根到底，降价是一句空话。1953年曾一度降价出售，结果许多商品发生脱销，不得不重新提高价格。这是我们宝贵的教训。
    刺激生产来改善人民的生活确有两种方法：一种是各地干部和职工同志所提出的降价多销；另一种是增加职工工资和适当地提高某些农副产品的收购价格。采用那一种方法，要看当时的具体情况而定。原料足，设备够，可以保证生产充分的商品，则采用第一种方法是应该的。反之，如果原料不足，设备一时难以扩大，不能保证供应充分的商品，只能采用第二种方法。若不顾一切条件，盲目地降低物价，结果不是降价多销，乃是降价脱销。几年来，我国人民的购买力提高了，市场上商品的供应还能大体上适应市场的需要，工业品市场基本上没有黑市，除了个别供不应求的副食品以外，基本上没有抢购的现象。这充分地说明了政府所采取的基本稳定工业品价格的方针是正确的。这也充分地说明了商品的生产和商品的分配，在稳定的商品价格之下，是平衡的。在这里，可以看出我们如何利用价值规律来为社会主义建设服务。这里的降价抬价是人为的，并非像在资本主义国家内，价格自动的升降来支配生产的增减；在我们这里不但价格不能支配生产的增减，而价格自己反受人的支配，我们无非利用价格来维持商品生产和商品分配的平衡而已。谁都知道，我们的社会主义国营企业所生产出来的各种消费品，必须经过卖买方式才能到达消费者手中。有卖买，必有货币；有货币，必有物价。而人定的物价定得合理不合理，可以决定卖买的成立不成立，生产与分配平衡不平衡，同时也可以决定商品的积压还是脱销。
    十一、结尾
    我在上一节中已说过，国民经济的各个方面、各个部门、各个地区，是一个有机地结合着的整体。我们要做好计划工作，必须首先掌握按比例发展的规律，而后按此规律，使重点和全面相结合。只顾重点，忽视其它的孤立主义思想是错误的；强调若干方面、若干地区，忽视其它方面、其它地区也是错误的，是违反按比例发展规律的。我在这篇论文中，因限于篇幅，只谈到几个环节，没有谈到每个环节中的各方面。例如工业是一个环节，这个环节中的各方面也应该谈到，才得称为全面综合平衡理论。工业除重工业和轻工业一个方面之外，还有沿海工业和内地工业间的平衡、原有工业和新建工业间的平衡、原料工业和加工工业间的平衡、建设规模和地质资源间的平衡、大型工业和中小型工业间的平衡、中央工业和地方工业间的平衡、国营工业和公私合营工业间的平衡等等，因限于篇幅，在这里不谈了，拟另作一文加以详细讨论。
