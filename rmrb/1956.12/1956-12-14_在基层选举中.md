Who Should Be Elected in Basic-Level Elections?

    The people's election in Urumqi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has begun. Before the preliminary list of candidates jointly nominated by the Second District was even delivered to the various electoral districts, voters had already started discussing who should be elected. After the list was published, voters in the Yucai Lane electoral district immediately began to argue when they saw the name Tuohu's on it. Kurban Simayi believed that Tuohu's did not care about the lives of the masses and disagreed with him being a candidate. He said: When I came to Urumqi from out of town, it was winter and very cold, but I was new to the area and couldn't find a place to live. I also had five children with me, which made it very difficult. I went to Tuohu's and asked him for help. At the time, not only did he not help, but he also seemed very impatient. Later, I found Hailiqihan, who warmly welcomed me and said she would definitely find a way to help me. A few days later, she actually found me a room. Gu Sumuhan from the New Market also agreed that Hailiqihan should be a candidate. He said: My wife is old and has disabled legs, so she can't do heavy work. But she knows how to mend shoes, she just can't get a license. After Hailiqihan found out, she actively went to the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce four times and finally got the license.
    The voters compared Tuohu's and Hailiqihan, and most of them agreed to elect Hailiqihan and disagreed with electing Tuohu's. Some individual voters, such as 80-year-old Mamat, agreed with Hailiqihan but were afraid that their opinion wouldn't matter. He said: Isn't it whoever the government assigns? There's no way the candidates proposed by the government (referring to the jointly nominated candidates) won't be elected, and the ones proposed by the masses will be elected instead! It wasn't until the election meeting, when it was announced that Hailiqihan had been elected, that he realized his past thinking was wrong.

Because He Accepted Criticism

    At the first meeting of the Second People's Congress of Goumen Township, Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province, Bai Jinfu was re-elected as the township head. Amid warm applause, he stepped onto the podium and said excitedly: "This election has been a great education for me. I will definitely respond to everyone's help and trust with practical actions of correcting my mistakes and doing my job well..."
    Bai Jinfu's consecutive re-elections as the head of Goumen Township involved a tortuous process.
    When Goumen Township conducted its election, the voters conducted a democratic review of the government's work and the cadres' work style, combining the nomination of representative candidates. They raised many criticisms to the Township People's Committee, most of which were criticisms of Bai Jinfu.
    Over the past two years, the masses have generally recognized Bai Jinfu's spirit of being active, responsible, hard-working in his work. However, his lack of democratic style and simple methods in his work have caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. Once, the Guadigou Village Agricultural Cooperative was in chaos due to a chaotic system, and the cooperative members did not obey the leadership of the cooperative cadres. The township did not help resolve the problem in time, so the cooperative director Jia Liangsheng asked to resign. Bai Jinfu scolded Jia Liangsheng without any investigation and understanding, saying, "You have to do it even if you don't want to!" This not only did not solve the problem, but also filled the cooperative cadres with anger, which further affected the work. Another example is in the distribution of relief funds. Due to Bai Jinfu's lack of in-depth investigation, blind distribution and other biases were caused. An old landlord, Old Woman Wang, whose son was in business, also received relief funds, while the poor peasant Bi Shengqing's family had been out of food for a long time but did not receive any relief.
    After Bai Jinfu's shortcomings and mistakes were exposed by the masses, instead of humbly accepting them, he became preoccupied with personal gains and losses and felt depressed. He thought: I'm so active, yet I still can't get a good reputation! ...Therefore, when nominating representative candidates, the voters said: "We have raised many opinions to Township Head Bai, and he has not expressed any attitude. We can't elect him as a representative." Therefore, everyone nominated other people as representative candidates.
    After the election work team reported these situations to the district, District Head Cao Huishun enlightened Bai Jinfu ideologically and asked him to admit his mistakes and correct his shortcomings to the masses. With the help of District Head Cao, Bai Jinfu understood the principle that accepting criticism and correcting mistakes was not "shameful" and mustered up the courage to take the initiative to make a self-criticism to the masses in several voter groups with more opinions on him. During the process of self-criticism, he boldly exposed all the shortcomings that the people had not yet raised and asked everyone to give him more opinions. As a result, the masses said with satisfaction: "Who doesn't have shortcomings? As long as they can be corrected, they are still good cadres." Voter Wang Zhenhua said: "In the past, Township Head Bai didn't even accept opinions. Now he can make a self-criticism to the masses. This is a big change." During the election, everyone re-elected Bai Jinfu as a representative. At the first meeting of the Second People's Congress of Goumen Township, Bai Jinfu made a self-criticism again when reporting on the work of the previous government and proposed ways to correct his mistakes in the future. Due to his sincere attitude and profound self-criticism, the representatives re-elected him as the head of Goumen Township.

The New Daughter-in-Law Became the Deputy Township Head

    In Cunrui Township, Longhua County, Hebei Province, a new daughter-in-law who had just married into the family was elected as a people's representative and elected as the deputy township head in the recent basic-level election.
    Her name is Dong Guirong, a probationary party member. A little over a month ago, she married Li Yunchang of Wayaogou Village, Cunrui Township. The day after she married into the family, she went to the agricultural production cooperative's cadres to learn about the situation of the cooperative and the people's school. On the third day, she went to mobilize Shi Lianwu's wife to attend the people's school. During the autumn harvest, the cooperative was very busy, so she went to the field to harvest crops. The cooperative members all said: This new daughter-in-law is really good!
    The basic-level election began, and most voters agreed to nominate her as a candidate. However, she had not been in Wayaogou for long, and although her performance was not bad, was it just a case of "a new daughter-in-law being diligent for three days"? In order to clarify this issue, voters Shi Lianwen and two others volunteered to register and go to her parents' township—Shaofu Township—to learn about Dong Guirong's past situation.
    It turned out that Dong Guirong had performed very well when she was a young woman. When the township established an advanced agricultural production cooperative, she went to various households to promote it, telling the masses about the prospects for social development, regardless of whether it was early or late, or whether the family was busy or idle. During the spring plowing season, more than 20 women in the cooperative could not participate in production because they were burdened by their children. After Dong Guirong found out, she helped them organize five baby-holding groups. Therefore, she was very popular among the cooperative members and was elected as the deputy director of the cooperative management committee. When she left Shaofu Township this time, many people were reluctant to let her go.
    After Shi Lianwen reported these situations to the voters, everyone said: "Electing such a person as a representative will definitely do good things for everyone." As a result, Dong Guirong was honorably elected as a people's representative at the election meeting, and was elected as the deputy township head when the Township People's Congress held its first meeting.

This is Where Democracy Is!

    On the morning of November 27th, a strange couple came to the polling station in the 35th electoral district of Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province. With a feeling of glory and pride, they elected the representatives they were happy with.
    The man is named Lai Zhonghe, an overseas Chinese who returned to China; the woman is named Lai Xiuying, originally from Japan, who was recently approved to join Chinese nationality. When Lai Xiuying was in Japan, she also participated in elections, but where was there any democracy there? In order to win the election, the reactionaries there resorted to any means to invite voters to drink wine, made fools of themselves by soliciting votes, and made a lot of noise by giving campaign speeches to deceive voters. Some honest and progressive Japanese people were persecuted by the police for voting for Japanese Communist Party members. In 1950, when the Japanese House of Councillors held elections, Lai Xiuying secretly voted for Japanese Communist Party members, but plainclothes police immediately came to ask her: Who did you vote for? When the Japanese House of Representatives held elections in 1953, the reactionaries' activities became even more rampant, so Lai Xiuying gave up her citizenship and did not vote.
    Now, exercising her civic rights for the first time on Chinese soil, how could she not be excited? She said excitedly: "This place is full of peace, democracy, and unity! Among the four representatives we elected, there is also a woman who can speak for us women!" She said that in addition to learning Chinese, she is also reading "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and Lenin's "State and Revolution" and other classic works, and will work hard to improve her political and cultural level and fulfill the obligations that a citizen should fulfill for the socialist cause!

    在基层选举中
    应该选谁？
    新疆维吾尔自治区乌鲁木齐市的普选开始了。第二区联合提名的初步候选人名单还没有交到各选区，选民们就开始酝酿着应该选谁。名单公布以后，育才巷选区的选民看到其中有托呼的的名字，立刻就争论起来。库尔班司马义认为托呼的对群众的生活不关心，不同意他作候选人。他说：我从外地来乌鲁木齐市时，正是冬天，很冷，但人地两生，找不到房子住。同时还带着五个孩子，很困难。我去找托呼的，请他帮帮忙。当时，他不但不给帮忙，还表现出很不耐烦的样子。后来我找到海力其汗，她热情地接待了我，并表示一定给我想办法。过了几天，她果真给我找到了一间房子。新市场的古苏木汗，也同意海力其汗当候选人。他说：我爱人年纪大了，而且双腿残废，不能作过重的劳动。但她会补鞋，就是领不到许可证。海力其汗知道后，主动到市工商联跑了四次，终于领到了许可证。
    选民们把托呼的和海力其汗比较了一下，大多数人都同意选海力其汗，不同意选托呼的。个别的选民，如八十岁的老大爷麻木提，虽然同意海力其汗，但怕提了也不顶事。他说：还不是政府指派谁，就是谁，哪里有政府提出的（指联合提名的候选人）选不上，群众提出的反而能选上的道理！直到在选举大会上，宣布海力其汗当选以后，他才知道自己过去的想法是错了。

    因为他接受了批评
    在陕西省延安县沟门乡第二届人民代表大会第一次会议上，白进福又当选了乡长。他在一片热烈的掌声中，他走上了主席台，激动地说：“这次选举对我教育很大，我一定要以改正错误、做好工作的实际行动，来回答大家对我的帮助和信任……。”
    白进福连选连任为沟门乡乡长，是有一段曲折过程的。
    沟门乡进行选举的时候，结合酝酿代表候选人，选民们对政府工作和干部作风进行了一次民主检查。他们给乡人民委员会提了不少批评意见，其中大部分都是批评白进福的。
    两年来，白进福在工作中积极负责、吃苦肯干的精神，群众是公认的。但，由于他在工作中民主作风不够，方式方法简单，引起了群众很大的不满。有一次，瓜地沟村农业社由于制度混乱，社员不服从社干部领导，乡上也没有及时帮助解决，社长贾良生因此要求辞职。白进福没作任何调查了解，就把贾良生训了一顿，说：“不干也要你干！”这样，不但没有解决问题，反而给社干部装了一肚子气，更加影响了工作。又如发放救济款中，由于白进福深入调查不够，造成盲目发放等偏向。有一个旧地主王老婆，她的儿子是经商的，还领了救济款，而贫农毕盛清家里很早就没粮食了，却分文未得到救济。
    白进福的这些缺点和错误被群众揭发后，他不但没有虚心接受，反而患得患失，苦闷起来。他想：我这样积极还讨不下个好！……因而在酝酿代表候选人时，选民们说：“咱对白乡长提了好多意见，他不表示任何态度，咱不能选他当代表啦。”于是，大家又在酝酿别人为代表候选人了。
    选举工作组把这些情况反映到区上以后，区长曹慧顺对白进福进行了思想启发，要他给群众承认错误改正缺点。在曹区长的帮助下，白进福懂得了接受批评改正错误并不是“丢人”的道理，才鼓足勇气主动地到对他意见较多的几个选民小组向群众作了检讨。在检讨过程中，对人民群众尚未提出的缺点，他都大胆地全部暴露出来，并要求大家多给他提些意见。这样一来，群众满意地说：“谁还没个缺点，只要能改正还是好干部。”选民王振华说：“以往白乡长连意见都不接受，现在能向群众检讨，这个转变可真不小啊。”在选举时，大家又选白进福当了代表。在沟门乡第二届人民代表大会第一次会议上，白进福报告上届政府工作时，又进行了自我批评，并提出了今后改正的办法。由于态度诚恳，检讨深刻，代表们又选他连任沟门乡的乡长。

    新媳妇当了副乡长
    河北省隆化县存瑞乡，有一个刚过门的新媳妇，在最近的基层选举中，被选为人民代表，并当选了副乡长。
    她的名字叫董桂荣，预备党员。一个多月前，她才和存瑞乡瓦窑沟村的李运昌结了婚。过门第二天，她就找农业生产合作社的干部，了解社里和民校的情况。第三天，就去动员石连五的媳妇上民校。秋收时，社里很忙，她就下地去割庄稼。社员们都说：这个新媳妇真好！
    基层选举开始了，多数选民都同意把她提为候选人。但她来到瓦窑沟的时间毕竟不长，表现虽说不坏，是不是“新媳妇勤三天”呢？为了弄清这一问题，选民石连文等三人自愿报名，到她娘家所在的乡——少府乡，去了解董桂荣过去的情况。
    原来，董桂荣当姑娘的时候，表现就很好。乡里建立高级农业生产合作社时，她不分早晚，也不管家里活计闲忙，天天到各家去宣传，给群众讲社会发展的远景。春耕时节，社里有二十多个妇女因为受孩子的累赘，不能参加生产。董桂荣知道后，就帮助她们组织了五个抱娃娃组。因此，她非常受社员欢迎，被选为社管理委员会的副主任。这次她离开少府乡时，很多人都恋恋不舍。
    石连文把这些情况向选民们报告以后，大家都说：“选这样的人当代表，一定能替大伙办好事情。”结果，在选举大会上，董桂荣光荣地当选为人民代表，并在乡人民代表大会举行第一次会议的时候，被选为副乡长。

    这里才有民主！
    11月27日早晨，浙江省杭州市上城区三十五选区投票站，来了一对陌生的夫妇，他们怀着光荣和自豪的心情，选举了自己乐意的代表。
    男的叫赖中和，是归国华侨；女的叫赖秀瑛，原籍日本，不久前才被批准加入中国国籍。赖秀瑛在日本的时节，也曾参加过选举，但是那里哪有民主可言呢？那里的反动派为了竞选，竟不择手段地请选民吃酒，丑态百出地乱拉选票，还大吹大擂地发表竞选演说，欺骗选民。有些正直的、进步的日本人，由于投了日本共产党员的票，就遭到警察的迫害。1950年，日本参议院举行选举时，赖秀瑛就曾秘密地投了日本共产党员的票，但紧接着便衣警察就来问她：你投的是谁的票？1953年日本众议院进行选举时，反动派活动更加猖狂，因而赖秀瑛就放弃了自己的公民权，没有投票。
    现在，她在中国的土地上，第一次行使自己的公民权利，心里怎么能不激动呢？她兴奋地说：“这里充满了和平、民主、团结的气氛！在我们选举的四个代表中，还有一个妇女，她可以代表我们妇女讲话！”她说她现在除了学习中文以外，还在读“毛泽东选集”、列宁的“国家与革命”等经典著作，要努力提高自己的政治和文化水平，为社会主义事业尽一分公民应尽的义务！　（臧利群）（附图片）
