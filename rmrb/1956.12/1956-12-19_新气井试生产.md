Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The first gas well in the Shiyougou-Dongxi structure in Sichuan Province is performing well in its trial production. In the month from November 15th to now, this gas well has produced 10% more natural gas than all other wells in the Longchang Gas Mine combined. The natural gas produced daily from this well can be used to make carbon black, enough to supply the rubber industry to manufacture two to three hundred large tires, and to supply the paint industry with enough for all factories in the Southwest for a year.

During the drilling process, this well experienced a strong gas blowout, with the gas column reaching as high as thirty meters. The gas output during trial production remains very high. These indications suggest that the Shiyougou-Dongxi structure, covering an area of more than 300 square kilometers, may become a rare gas field in the world.

    新气井试生产
    据新华社讯　四川省石油沟——东溪构造的第一口气井，试生产的情况良好。在11月15日到现在的一月里，这口气井所出的天然气，比隆昌气矿所有其他各井所出的天然气还多10％。用这口井每天出产的天然气烧成碳黑，供应橡胶工业可以制成大轮胎二、三百只，供应油漆工业足够西南各厂一年的需要。
    这口井在钻进过程中曾经发生强烈的气喷，气柱高达三十公尺，试生产中出气量仍然很大。这些迹象证明面积达三百多平方公里的石油沟——东溪构造，可能成为世界上少有的气田。
