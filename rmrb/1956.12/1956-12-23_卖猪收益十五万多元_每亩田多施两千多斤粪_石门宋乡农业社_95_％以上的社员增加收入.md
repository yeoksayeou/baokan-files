Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 22nd. Xinhua News Agency reporter Song Jie reports: The Shimen Songxiang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, which is famous throughout the country for raising pigs to fertilize fields, yesterday sold another 160 fat pigs to the state-owned food company in Yanggu County. Among the 17,097 pigs currently raised by this cooperative, there are still 1,450 mature pigs that will be released from their pens before the Spring Festival to supply urban and rural people for the Spring Festival.

Since March of this year, this cooperative has successively sold 2,560 fat pigs to the state. Including the 4,800 piglets supplied to neighboring cooperatives, the net income has reached 154,880 yuan. Due to the increase in pig raising, the amount of manure applied to the cooperative's 31,567 mu of farmland has increased from an average of about 5,000 jin per mu last year to 7,500 jin, and the annual grain output per mu is 466 jin, an increase of 193 jin per mu compared with the average output of neighboring cooperatives. As a result, 95.8% of the cooperative members have increased their income compared to last year.

Since the cooperative increased pig raising, the amount of meat eaten by the members has also greatly increased. In addition to the extra supply of five jin of pork from the state for each fat pig sold by the members, the cooperative also slaughtered 268 pigs during the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival. Wei Qinghuai, a member who raised five fat pigs in ten months, used to eat only a little over ten jin of meat a year for his family of seven when he didn't raise pigs, but this year he has already eaten over thirty jin of pork in ten months.

    卖猪收益十五万多元　每亩田多施两千多斤粪
    石门宋乡农业社95％以上的社员增加收入
    新华社济南22日电　新华社记者宋杰报道：以养猪肥田闻名全国的山东省阳谷县石门宋乡农业生产合作社，昨天又把一百六十头肥猪卖给了阳谷县的国营食品公司。这个社现在喂养的一万七千零九十七头生猪中，还有成猪一千四百五十头将在春节前陆续出圈，供应城乡人民春节时食用。
    这个社从今年3月以来陆续卖给国家的肥猪，已经有二千五百六十头，连同供应邻社的四千八百头仔猪在内，纯收益共达十五万四千八百八十元。由于养猪增加，这个社三万一千五百六十七亩农田施的圈肥，平均每亩由去年的五千斤左右增加到七千五百斤，每亩年产粮食四百六十六斤，比邻社的平均每亩产量增加一百九十三斤。因此，全社95.8％的社员比去年增加了收入。
    这个社从增养生猪以来，社员们吃肉的数量也大大增加了。社员们除了出卖一头肥猪国家格外供应五斤猪肉以外，在端阳节和中秋节社内还杀了二百六十八头猪。十个月内养成五头肥猪的社员魏庆怀，在不养猪的时候，全家七口人一年也不过吃十多斤肉，而今年十个月内已经吃到三十多斤猪肉了。
