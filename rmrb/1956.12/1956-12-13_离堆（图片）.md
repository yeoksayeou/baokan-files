    Lidui
    (Traditional Chinese Painting)
    Lidui is located where the Minjiang River and the Dujiangyan Irrigation System meet in Guanxian, Sichuan. It was originally a gravel rock extending from Wanglei Mountain. Around 300 BC, Li Bing, the governor of Shu, constructed the Dujiangyan Irrigation System and opened a waterway here. The gravel rock was thus carved open, becoming isolated in the river, and named Lidui.

    离堆
    （国画）
    离堆在四川灌县岷江和都江堰相连的地方，原来是王垒山斜出的一块砾岩，公元前三百年左右蜀太守李冰兴建都江堰时，在这里开凿了一个口道，砾岩便被凿开，孤立江中，叫做离堆。
