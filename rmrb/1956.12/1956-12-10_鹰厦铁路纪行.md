A Travelogue on the Yingxia Railway
By Our Correspondent Shang Kai

　　Following the Path of the Red Army

　　In the low hills of southeastern Jiangxi.

　　The sun climbed over the eastern mountains, the morning mist gradually dissipated, and the Xin River bank revealed a town built of red rocks, made even more beautiful and charming by the morning glow and green trees. This is the starting point of the Yingxia Railway—Yingtan.

　　Yingtan is an ancient ferry crossing, located close to the south bank of the Xin River. Behind Yingtan, to the west of the ferry, is a small earth mountain called Dragon Head Mountain. It juts into the quiet Xin River like a dragon's head. The Xin River suddenly makes a turn, rushing noisily to the northwest. Over the years, this has created a deep, bottomless pool in the heart of the river. On Dragon Head Mountain, ancient trees reach to the sky, and every evening, flocks of eagles soar up and down here. The name Yingtan, or Eagle Pool, comes from this.

　　Two or three decades ago, Yingtan was a prosperous town with a population of 20,000. Since suffering a catastrophe at the hands of Japanese imperialism, the population has dwindled to less than 5,000, and the market is in decline.

　　One morning in the winter of 1954, trains loaded with railway soldiers arrived in Yingtan. This heroic construction force, during the years of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, had proudly proclaimed, "Wherever the army advances, the railway will be built!" On the battlefields of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, they braved enemy bombing to ensure an "unbreakable, unbombable" steel transportation line. Today, in the days of peaceful construction, they have once again accepted the glorious task assigned by the motherland—to rush the construction of the Yingxia Railway.

　　The Yingxia Railway starts from Yingtan in Jiangxi and ends at Xiamen on the frontline of the East China Sea in Fujian, with a total length of nearly 700 kilometers. The area it passes through was a revolutionary base area during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War. The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led by Comrade Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms, once fought in the mountains of this area. Every mountain, every stream, is permeated with the blood and sweat of the Red Army soldiers and bears the footprints of the Red Army soldiers. Twenty years later, the heroic railway soldiers are once again advancing bravely along the path taken by the Red Army. While working, they sang:

　　The towering mountains crossed by the Red Army,
　　Will be tunneled and paved flat by the railway soldiers;
　　The river valleys and streams crossed by the Red Army,
　　Will have bridges built by the railway soldiers for trains to pass;
　　Following the path of the Red Army,
　　Overcoming difficulties, fearing no hardship,
　　Let the railway be like an arm of steel,
　　Stretching from Yingtan to the port for liberating Taiwan as soon as possible.

　　Now, the bold words of the railway soldiers have become a reality. The sound of train whistles is echoing through the valleys of southeastern China. Soon, trains full of local products, industrial raw materials, and construction materials will shuttle back and forth from Yingtan to Xiamen day and night.

          Crossing the Wuyi Mountains

　　The train departs from Yingtan and travels southeast along the new roadbed. Outside the window is a stretch of lush green rice paddies, with clusters of farmhouses occasionally flashing by. In the distance, on the lush green hillsides, herds of yellow cattle graze slowly. This is a charming scene of southern China.

　　After passing through several small stations, the mountains gradually increase, and the Wuyi Mountains, a range of peaks, stand like a natural screen across the border between Fujian and Jiangxi. The Tie Niu Pass, known for its steepness, tightly controls the throat of transportation between Fujian and Jiangxi, and has been a strategic location for military strategists since ancient times. A hundred years ago, Shi Dakai, the Wing King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, led an army of 300,000 to capture Tie Niu Pass and drove straight into Fujian. Twenty years ago, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army also entered and exited Tie Niu Pass several times, relying on the steep terrain here to block the White bandit army. Now, tunnels appear one after another, the largest of which is the Dahe Mountain Tunnel, which is 1,460 meters long. As the train passes smoothly through this group of tunnels to the sound of pleasant music, I can't help but recall the story told by Deputy Commander Liu Ke, a colonel, of the Railway Corps, about the early opening of the Dahe Mountain Tunnel:

　　"According to the construction schedule at the time," Colonel Liu Ke said, "the Dahe Mountain Tunnel had to be completed by July 1956 to ensure the full line would be open to traffic by the end of 1957. The rocks here are all hard granite with a Protodyakonov strength coefficient of 15 or more. When the pilot tunnel began to be excavated in June 1955, it could only advance 1.7 meters per day from each end. At this rate, it would take 14 months just to excavate the pilot tunnel. This meant that the progress of the Dahe Mountain Tunnel would delay the completion of the entire line, which could not be allowed." What to do? Colonel Liu Ke continued, "At this time, Comrade Yin Shanglong, an excellent Communist Party member and company commander with the rank of captain, first improved the organization of cyclical operations, formulated a strict handover system, organized labor competitions between various shifts, improved the effectiveness of explosions, and accelerated the loading and unloading of slag. As a result, the excavation progress of the Dahe Mountain Tunnel was rapidly improved. In July 1955, it progressed 2.13 meters per day, in October it progressed 3.5 meters per day, and by January 1956, it had increased to 5.08 meters per day. Later, a new record of 19 meters per day was achieved. The Dahe Mountain Tunnel was finally completed in full at the end of February, and the engineering train passed through Dahe Mountain on March 5, five months ahead of schedule. The early completion of the Dahe Mountain Tunnel played a decisive role in the early completion of the Yingxia Road by one year."

　　Now, as the train passes through here, you can still see the heroic poems left by the heroic railway soldiers on the cliffs and rock walls:

　　"No matter how high the cliffs are, we will cut them into plains, with white clouds above our heads and fog under our feet, swinging on swings halfway up the mountain, labor enthusiasm is like a raging fire, heroes conquer Dahe Mountain."

　　The Train Enters the Northern Fujian Mountains

　　In the summer of 1956, on an unforgettable day, the train whistle sounded a long blast, and the train entered the northern Fujian mountains for the first time.

　　Northern Fujian, with its rolling mountains and overlapping peaks, has always been known for its "poor transportation." Local products could not get out, and industrial products could not get in. Chenjiadian in Guangze County is a remote mountain village where a peddler visits less than once a year. There, a load of rice could not be exchanged for three feet of cloth, not even five pounds of salt, and many farmers had to "eat bland food all year round." The saying "sea salt is as precious as gold" was widespread.

　　When the track-laying train first entered the northern Fujian mountains, the area within 50 li along the line was in an uproar. Grandfathers carried grandsons, mothers held daughters, and young men waved colorful flags and carried flowers, coming from dozens of miles away to welcome the train. A fiery scene unfolded, with gongs and drums resounding and firecrackers popping. Elderly farmers were invited onto the engineering train, and the soldiers of the track-laying team were raised high by the masses. Colorful flags and flowers drowned the newly laid tracks, turning them into a colorful dragon.

　　The people of northern Fujian's joy at welcoming the train is entirely understandable. Because the train changed people's lives.

　　In the past, Guangze City had only one department store and food store operated by the county supply and marketing cooperative, with high prices and incomplete goods. As for eating fresh fruit, that was more difficult than anything else. Comrade Yang Lixiang, manager of the county trading company, told a story. He said, "One year, we transported a batch of bananas. This batch of bananas traveled by boat and then by car, and was finally carried into Guangze City on poles. More than 1,000 catties rotted without being sold. Later, we poured them into the trash can as we sold them, and they all rotted before they were sold out. Even these rotten bananas were still selling for 56 cents a catty at that time." The same was true for other commodities, with high transportation costs, long durations, and large losses. Selling prices were often one or two times higher than the actual value. After the Yingxia Railway opened to traffic, the situation changed. Not to mention anything else, transportation costs alone were reduced by more than 56% compared to the past, and it is estimated that transportation costs will be further reduced after formal operations begin. Therefore, the people of Guangze are now eating things they couldn't eat in the past, and wearing things they didn't wear in the past. In the glass cabinets of department stores and food stores, we see: Guangzhou suitcases, Hangzhou large floral satin quilt covers, Shanghai embroidered wool blankets, Jinhua ham, Shanxi Fenjiu, Qingdao beer, and Tonghua wine... The fruit stalls are even more dazzling, with: Shandong pears, northeastern apples, and bananas, pineapples, pomelos, and various other unnamed fruits produced along the coast of Fujian. A salesman at the department store branch said: "The number of general merchandise has increased from 200-300 in the past to more than 3,000, and still cannot meet the needs of the masses." According to their statistics, in the second and third quarters of this year alone, they sold more than 4,000 pairs of rubber shoes.

　　Since the northern section of the Yingxia Railway opened to traffic, the people of the northern Fujian mountains, who have been isolated from the outside world for generations, often travel in groups of three or five, buy tickets to Yingtan or Nanping, play for a day, stay overnight, and then take the train back. Teachers from elementary schools in Guangze County organized a tour group of more than 40 people this summer, took the train to West Lake in Hangzhou, and spent a pleasant summer vacation. Many of them were traveling outside the mountains for the first time, and they said, "Things that we wouldn't even dare to dream of in the past have now become a reality." (To be continued)

　　鹰厦铁路纪行
　　本报记者　商恺
    踏着红军走过的道路
    在赣东南低丘陵地带。
    太阳爬上了东方的山头，晨雾渐渐散去，信江岸上展现出一座用红色岩石建筑的市镇，在朝霞和绿树掩映下，更显得美丽多姿。这便是鹰厦铁路的起点——鹰潭。
    鹰潭是一个古渡口，紧濒信江的南岸。鹰潭的背后，渡口的西边，有一座不太高的土山，名叫龙头山。它像只龙头一样伸进了静静的信江。信江猛地转了个弯，喧闹着向西北流去。年长日久，在江心旋成一个深不及底的水潭。龙头山上，古树参天，每日傍晚，成群的苍鹰在这里上下飞旋。鹰潭的名字，便是由此得来的。
    鹰潭在二三十年前，是一个有两万人口的繁荣市镇，自从遭受了日本帝国主义一次浩劫，人口剩了不足五千，市面萧条了。
    1954年冬天的一个早晨，满载铁道兵的列车，开到了鹰潭。这支英雄的筑路部队，在第三次国内革命战争的年代里，曾以“大军打到哪里，铁路就修到哪里”而自豪；在抗美援朝的战场上，冒着敌机的轰炸，保障了一支“打不断，炸不烂”的钢铁运输线。今天在和平建设的日子里，他们又接受了祖国交给的光荣任务——抢建鹰厦铁路。
    鹰厦铁路从江西的鹰潭起，到福建东海前线的厦门止，全程近七百公里。它所通过的地区，远在第二次国内革命战争时期，便是革命根据地。毛泽东同志和他的战友们所带领的工农红军，就曾转战在这一带的山区里。这里的每一座山头，每一条溪流，都渗透着红军战士的血和汗，都印有红军战士的脚迹。二十年后的今天，英雄的铁道战士又在踏着当年红军走过的道路奋勇前进。他们一边施工，一边唱着：
    红军越过的丛山峻岭，
    铁道战士要把它凿通铺平；
    红军涉过的河谷溪流，
    铁道战士要架起桥梁让列车通行；
    踏着红军走过的道路，
    战胜困难，不畏艰苦，
    让铁路像钢铁的臂膀，
    从鹰潭早日伸到解放台湾的港口。
    如今，铁道战士们的豪语，已经变成了现实。火车的汽笛声在震荡着祖国东南的山谷，不久之后，从鹰潭到厦门，满载土特产品、工业原料和建筑器材的列车，就会像穿梭一样地日夜奔驰。
          穿过武夷山区
    列车从鹰潭开出，沿着新路基向东南方向行驶。窗外是一抹葱绿的稻田，偶尔有三五成簇的农舍一闪而过。远处葱郁的山坡上，吃草的黄色牛群在缓缓移动。这是一派迷人的江南景色。
    列车穿过了几个小站，山峦渐渐增多起来，一支为群峰组成的武夷山脉，像座天然的屏风，横亘在闽赣界上。以险峻著称的铁牛关，紧紧地扼住了闽赣交通的咽喉，为自古以来兵家必争之地。一百年前，太平天国翼王石达开带领了三十万大军攻占了铁牛关，长驱直入福建。二十年前，中国工农红军也曾几度进出铁牛关，凭着这里的险峻地势，阻击过白匪军。现在，这里出现了一个接着一个的隧洞，其中最大的是大禾山隧洞，长达一千四百六十公尺。当列车在悦耳的音乐声中，平稳地通过这里的隧道群的时候，我不禁想起铁道兵副司令刘克大校讲过的关于提前打通大禾山隧道的故事：
      “按照当时的施工进度计划，”刘克大校说：“大禾山隧洞必须在1956年7月完工，才能保证1957年年底全线通车。这里的岩石，全是普氏强度系数十五级以上的坚硬的花岗岩。1955年6月开始挖导坑，每天一端只能进一点七公尺，照这样下去，光开挖导坑，就要十四个月，就是说大禾山隧洞的进度将推迟全线完工的期限，而这是不能允许的。”怎么办呢？刘克大校继续叙述下去：“就在这时候，优秀的共产党员上尉连长尹尚龙同志，首先改善了循环作业的组织，制定了严密的交接班制度，组织了各班之间的劳动竞赛，提高了爆炸效力，加速了装渣出渣工作，于是大禾山隧道的开挖进度迅速提高了，1955年7月份日进二点一三公尺，十月份日进三点五公尺，到1956年1月份，便提高到日进五点零八公尺，后来并出现了日进十九公尺的新纪录。大禾山隧洞终于在2月底全部完工，工程列车于三月五日通过了大禾山，较计划完工期限提前了五个月。大禾山隧洞的提前完工，对提前一年修通鹰厦路起了决定性的作用。”
    如今，当列车通过这里的时候，还可以看到英雄的铁道战士在山崖上、石壁上留下的英雄诗句：
      “任凭悬崖万丈高，也要削成地平川，头顶白云脚踏雾，半山腰里荡秋千，劳动热情似烈火，英雄战胜大禾山。”
      火车开进了闽北山区
    1956年夏天，在一个不可忘怀的日子里，汽笛一声长鸣，火车第一次开进了闽北山区。
    闽北，群山起伏，峰峦重叠，从来就以“交通闭塞”著称。土特产品出不去，工业产品进不来。光泽县的陈家店，是一个偏僻的山村，货郎担一年也去不上一次，在那里一担稻谷换不到三尺布，抵不上五斤盐，许多农民只有“长年食淡”。到处流传着“海盐贵似金”的说法。
    当铺轨工程列车第一次开进闽北山区的时候，沿线五十里以内的地区都沸腾起来了。爷爷抱着孙孙，母亲携着女儿，青年小伙子们打着彩旗，抱着鲜花，从几十里以外赶来欢迎火车。一个火热的场面展开了，锣鼓喧天，鞭炮齐鸣，老年农民被请上工程列车，铺轨大队的战士被群众高高地举了起来。彩旗和鲜花淹没了新铺的路轨，变成了一条彩龙。
    闽北人民欢迎火车的心情是完全可以理解的。因为火车改变了人们的生活面貌。
    过去，光泽城里只有县供销社的一个百货食品门市部，价格贵，货色又不全，至于要吃新鲜的水果，那比什么都困难。县贸易公司经理杨立祥同志讲了一个故事。他说：“有一年，我们运来了一批香蕉。这批香蕉坐了船又坐汽车，最后用担子挑到了光泽城里。没有卖，就烂掉了一千多斤。后来，随卖随往垃圾箱里倒，没卖光就烂光了。就是这样的烂香蕉当时还要卖五角六分钱一斤哩。”其他商品也是这样，运价高，费时长，损耗又大。出售价格常常比实际价值高出一、二倍以上。鹰厦铁路通车以后，情形就不同了。不要说别的，光运价就比过去降低了56％以上，估计将来正式营业后，运价还要降低。所以，光泽人民在过去吃不到的东西，现在吃到了，过去没有穿过的东西，现在穿到了。在百货商店和食品商店的玻璃柜里，我们看到：有广州的皮箱，杭州的大花软缎被面，上海的挑花毛毯，金华的火腿，山西汾酒，青岛啤酒和通化葡萄酒……在水果摊上，摆的更是琳琅满目，这里有：山东的鸭梨，东北的苹果，以及福建沿海一带出产的香蕉、菠萝、柚子和各种说不出名的水果。百货公司门市部的售货员说：“百货商品已由过去的二三百种增加到三千多种了，还不能满足群众的要求呢。”根据他们的统计，今年二三季度，仅仅胶鞋一项就卖了四千多双。
    世世代代和外界隔绝的闽北山区人民，自从鹰厦铁路北段通车以后，常三五人结伴买票上车，到鹰潭或者南平玩上一天，住上一夜，再坐火车回来。光泽县小学教师在今年暑期，就曾组织了一个四十多人的旅行团，坐火车到杭州西湖，度过了一个愉快的暑期。其中有许多人都第一次出这山区，他们说：“过去连作梦都不敢想的事情，现在变成现实了。”（未完）
