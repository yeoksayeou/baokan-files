　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 8th: Our metallurgical personnel have trial-smelted and forged more than twenty types of special steel and forged blanks for manufacturing steam turbines.

　　The main components and parts of steam turbines require many kinds of specially smelted alloy steel, some of which require very high technology for forging. Two years ago, when the state-owned Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory was trial-producing China's first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine, it began preparing to establish a special steelmaking workshop and organized factories in Shenyang, Benxi, Taiyuan, and other places to collaboratively trial-smelt and forge various alloy steels and forged blanks. Over the past two years, special alloy steels for steam turbine blades, spindles, and springs have been initially trial-smelted successfully, and some have already been used in mass-produced 2,500-kilowatt and 6,000-kilowatt steam turbines. A batch of alloy steel for main shafts and impellers, trial-smelted not long ago, has now begun trial forging and processing.

　　Steam turbine speed control mechanisms, special valves, oil pumps, and other accessories and fittings, which originally relied on foreign supply, have now also been successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory and domestic cooperating factories.

　  试制汽轮机用钢材
    新华社上海8日电　我国冶金人员已经试炼和锻制了二十多种制造汽轮机的特殊钢和锻坯。
    汽轮机的主要部件和零件，需要很多种特殊冶炼的合金钢，有的要用很高的技术进行锻制。两年前，国营上海汽轮机厂在试制我国第一台六千瓩汽轮机的时候，就开始筹备建立专门的炼钢车间，并且组织沈阳、本溪、太原等地的工厂，协同试炼、锻制各种合金钢和锻坯。两年来，汽轮机的叶片、梢、弹簧等用的特殊合金钢，已经初步试炼成功，有的已经在成批生产的二千五百瓩和六千瓩汽轮机中应用。不久以前试炼出来的一批主轴、叶轮用的合金钢，现在也开始了试验锻打和加工。
    原来依靠国外供应的汽轮机调速机构、特殊阀门、油泵等附件配件，现在也已经由上海汽轮机厂和国内协作工厂试制成功。
