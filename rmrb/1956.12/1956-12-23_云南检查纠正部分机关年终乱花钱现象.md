    Yunnan Checks and Corrects the Phenomenon of Some Agencies Spending Money Recklessly at the End of the Year
    (Our newspaper's report) According to the Yunnan Daily, recently, relevant units in Yunnan Province formed an inspection team to inspect the year-end expenditure of twenty-two agencies in Yunnan Province and Kunming City. They found that many departments were trying every means to rush to spend money as the end of the year approached, unwilling to turn over the surplus funds in the budget to the state, resulting in a large waste of funds.
    Some units sent people everywhere to purchase equipment that was not urgently needed and was not in the plan. The Kunming Municipal Party School is preparing to expand next year, but before the basic construction plan has been determined, it ordered ninety desks, three hundred and sixty single and double beds, and one hundred steel teapots. The Provincial Sports Commission wants to set up a guest house, and has already ordered one hundred and twenty-six sofas, ninety-five spring beds, one thousand cotton quilts, and also bought ninety-five wool blankets. Some units purchased more goods than actually needed, resulting in stockpiling and waste. For example, the Provincial Land Utilization Bureau has one hundred and eighty-seven exploration team members, and bought three hundred and thirty-one raincoats and two hundred and twenty-one pairs of rubber shoes. Even if each person had one, there would still be one hundred and forty-four raincoats and thirty-four pairs of rubber shoes left. Some units, unable to buy materials in the province, sent people to Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places to purchase them. Currently, two hundred and twenty units in Kunming have ordered a total of 76,099 pieces of large furniture such as tables, chairs, wooden beds, and cabinets, plus other woodenware, with a total value of 2,813,000 yuan. Judging from the current processing capacity of the wooden furniture industry in Kunming, these woodenware items will not be completed until April 1958.
    The Provincial People's Committee has issued a notice requiring all departments and regions to strictly control expenditures, and any undertakings that can be postponed should be resolutely postponed; everything that can be saved should be saved as much as possible. Responsible comrades of all units should personally conduct an inspection, and promptly stop and correct this phenomenon of reckless spending.

    云南检查纠正部分机关年终乱花钱现象
    本报讯　据云南日报报道：最近，云南省有关单位组成了检查组，对云南省和昆明市的二十二个机关的年终经费使用情况作了检查，发现不少部门因为临近年终，想尽方法赶时间花钱，不想把预算结余资金上缴给国家，大量浪费了资金。
    有些单位派人四处购买并不急需的在计划以外的设备。昆明市委党校准备明年扩建，但基本建设计划还没有确定，就订购了办公桌九十张，单人和双人床三百六十张和钢精茶壶一百把，省体育运动委员会要设立一个招待所，现在已经订了沙发一百二十六架，弹簧床九十五张，棉絮一千床，还买进毛毯九十五床。一些单位购买的东西超过实际需要的数量，形成积压浪费；如省土地利用局现有勘探队员一百八十七人，就买进三百三十一件雨衣，二百二十一双胶鞋，即使每人一份还剩雨衣一百四十四件，胶鞋三十四双。有的单位在省内买不到物资，还派人到上海、广州等地收购。目前已有二百二十个单位在昆明订购桌、椅、木床、橱柜等大型家具共七万六千零九十九件，加上其他木器，总值达二百八十一万三千元。以目前昆明市木器沙发业加工的能力来看，这些木器需要到1958年4月才能完工。
    省人民委员会已发出通知，要求各部门、各地区严格控制支出，凡是可以缓办的事业应当坚决缓办；凡是可以节省的尽量节省。各单位负责同志应该亲自下手进行一次检查、及早制止和纠正这种乱花钱的现象。
