    Cannot Relax Management of Cotton Cloth

    Cotton cloth is a commodity under the state's unified purchase and sales system. However, some commercial departments in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province mistakenly believe that after the opening of the free market, the management of cotton cloth can also be relaxed.

    Many grassroots retail units in Changzhi Special District buy cotton cloth from other places at retail prices, and then sell these cotton cloths in the local market at higher prices, which confuses the retail prices of cotton cloth and makes consumers suffer. A supply and marketing cooperative in Licheng County purchased 5,993 chi of homespun cloth from a public-private joint venture cotton cloth store in Xingtai City, Hebei Province, at retail prices, and then sold it at 1.2 fen higher than the listed price per chi. The Zhongwujing Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Pingshun County bought two bundles of homespun cloth from vendors at retail prices, and set the price at 2 jiao and 1 fen per chi when selling it, which was 3.5 fen higher than the listed price.

    Some stores do not strictly implement the system of purchasing cloth with coupons in order to complete their cotton cloth sales tasks. The Qinyuan County Textile Company currently owes 230,000 chi of cloth coupons. The Tunliu County Textile Company owes 200,000 chi of cloth coupons. Other companies have similar situations. Some retail units still collect coupons selectively when selling cotton cloth. Customers familiar with the store's salesperson can sometimes pay less or owe cloth coupons.

    Because these commercial departments have not strictly implemented the system of supplying cotton cloth with coupons, the masses do not pay attention to cloth coupons and think that they are dispensable. This problem should be solved quickly.

### 对棉布不可放松管理

    对棉布不可放松管理
    棉布是国家统购统销的物资。可是，山西长治专区有些商业部门错误地认为：在开放自由市场以后，棉布也可以放松管理了。
    长治专区不少基层零售单位，自己以零售价格到外地收买棉布，以后再以高价在本地市场上出售这些棉布，使棉布零售价格混乱，也使消费者吃亏。黎城县一个供销合作社，以零售价到河北邢台市公私合营棉布门市部购回土布五千九百九十三尺，以后每尺高出牌价一分二厘出售。平顺县中五井供销合作社，以零售价向小贩买回土布两捆，出售的时候自行定价为每尺二角一分，高出牌价三分五厘。
    有些门市部为了完成棉布销售任务，不严格执行凭票购布制度。沁源县纺织品公司，现在外欠布票二十三万尺。屯留县纺织品公司外欠布票二十万尺。别的公司也有类似的情况。有些零售单位，在零售棉布的时候，还有看人收票的情形。同商店营业员熟悉的顾客，有时可以少付或赊欠布票。
    由于这些商业部门没有严格地执行凭票供应棉布制度，群众对布票不重视了，认为它是可有可无的。这个问题应该赶快解决。
