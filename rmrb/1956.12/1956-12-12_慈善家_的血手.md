    The Bloody Hands of a "Philanthropist"
    Not long ago, the French Socialist Party's newspaper, "Le Peuple de Paris," published a lengthy article calling on the French people to donate winter clothing for the children of Algeria. The article stated that, in order to launch this "Winter Clothing Drive," French Prime Minister Mollet personally spoke to the leaders of the press, and pointed out in a somber tone: "In all suffering, children are the most unfortunate!"
    Look, what a benevolent heart the French Prime Minister has! The misfortune of Algerian children has aroused such deep concern in him.
    But why has misfortune befallen the children of Algeria? To answer this question, one cannot fail to see the criminal face of this Prime Minister. It is this Prime Minister who has escalated the war in Algeria. When he came to power, there were only 150,000 French troops stationed in Algeria, but now the number of French "expeditionary forces" has exceeded 400,000. These "expeditionary forces," who went to Algeria to carry out Prime Minister Mollet's bloody policies, committed all kinds of atrocities on Algerian soil, killing and arsoning. Here is one example of countless atrocities: In a town called Ballestro, French troops, in order to suppress the resistance of local residents, arrested fourteen residents and executed them on the spot, and set fire to many houses on Pierre-Saint-Paul Street; in one of these houses, seven women were burned alive. In this way, millions of Algerian children have lost their dear parents and warm homes, and are wandering the streets in loneliness. Their misfortune is more than just a lack of winter clothing!
    Now, after pushing the children of Algeria into the abyss of misfortune, Mollet wants to dress himself up as a benevolent philanthropist. But when he puts on a sorrowful face and reaches out to ask the French people to raise winter clothes for Algerian children, people see the blood of the Algerian people on his hands.

    “慈善家”的血手
    不久以前，法国社会党的机关报“巴黎人民报”用显著的篇幅登载了一篇文章，号召法国人民为阿尔及利亚的孩子们捐献寒衣。这篇文章写道：为了开展这个“募集寒衣运动”，法国总理摩勒亲自把新闻界领导人找来讲了话，并且用沉痛的语调指出：“在一切痛苦的情况下，孩子们是最不幸的！”
    看，法国的这位总理有着怎样的一副菩萨心肠啊！阿尔及利亚孩子的不幸，居然引起了他如此深切的关怀。
    但是，不幸的灾难，为什么会降临到阿尔及利亚孩子的头上呢？要回答这个问题，人们不能不看到这位总理的那副罪恶的面孔。就是这位总理，把阿尔及利亚的战火越烧越大。在他上台的时候，法国驻在阿尔及利亚的军队只有十五万人，而现在法国“远征军”的人数已经超过了四十万。这些到阿尔及利亚去执行摩勒总理的血腥政策的“远征军”，在阿尔及利亚的国土上杀人放火，无恶不作。下面是数不清的暴行中的一个例子：在一个名叫巴勒斯特罗的镇子上，法国军队因为要镇压当地居民的反抗，就抓了十四个居民来就地枪决，并且放火烧毁比埃尔—圣·保罗街上的不少房屋；在其中的一所房屋里，有七个妇女被活活烧死了。就这样千千万万个阿尔及利亚的孩子失去了亲爱的爹娘和温暖的家，孤苦零仃地流落在街头。他们的不幸，岂止是缺少寒衣而已！
    现在，摩勒在把阿尔及利亚的孩子推进不幸的深渊以后，却想把自己打扮成一个菩萨心肠的慈善家了。但是，当他装成悲天悯人的样子伸出手来要求法国人民为阿尔及利亚的儿童募集寒衣的时候，人们看到了他手上沾满着阿尔及利亚人民的鲜血。
