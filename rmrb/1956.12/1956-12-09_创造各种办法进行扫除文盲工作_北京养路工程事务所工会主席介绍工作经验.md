Xinhua News Agency Report:
　　The chairman of the trade union of the Beijing Road Engineering Bureau's Road Maintenance Engineering Office introduced the methods they adopted to achieve success in carrying out illiteracy elimination work among employees at the Beijing Employee Literacy Cadre Meeting on the 7th.

　　The Beijing Road Engineering Bureau's Road Maintenance Engineering Office has a total of more than 1,700 employees. Since the launch of the literacy campaign this year, the vast majority of illiterate and semi-illiterate workers, accounting for about 70% of the workforce, have participated in and persisted in cultural studies due to linking theory to practice and adopting various forms of learning organizations. About 95% of the enrolled employees regularly participate in learning, basically eliminating absenteeism. In the first half of this year, the passing rate of employee learning reached over 84%.

　　The Road Maintenance Engineering Office's work units are scattered, production organization changes frequently, and the employees' education levels vary. The literacy work has adopted learning formats such as classes, groups, contracted teaching and learning, self-study, and "little teachers" according to these specific circumstances. Students of the same level with fifteen or more people are organized into classes, students of the same level with three to fifteen people are organized into groups, students of the same level with fewer than three people who also have teachers implement contracted teaching and learning, those with few people but no teachers but who have some foundation and can self-study are organized for self-study, and those with few people and unable to self-study adopt methods such as children teaching parents and wives teaching husbands to find "little teachers" to learn.

　　The Road Maintenance Engineering Office used on-site materials to solve the source of literacy teachers.

　　Before launching the literacy campaign, the persons in charge of the Party, government, trade union, Communist Youth League, vocational school, and other aspects of the Road Maintenance Engineering Office conducted research and analysis. First, they understood the number, distribution, and ideological conditions of illiterate people and teachers. On this basis, propaganda was carried out using methods such as mass mobilization meetings, mutual assistance mobilization, and individual persuasion.

　　创造各种办法进行扫除文盲工作
　　北京养路工程事务所工会主席介绍工作经验
    据新华社讯　北京市道路工程局养路工程事务所的工会主席，在7日北京市职工扫盲干部会上，介绍了他们在职工当中进行扫盲工作取得成绩的办法。
    北京市道路工程局养路工程事务所的职工共有一千七百多人，今年开展扫盲运动以来，由于联系实际，采用多种学习组织形式，占职工70％左右的文盲、半文盲绝大多数参加并且坚持了文化学习。经常参加学习的占入学职工的95％左右，基本上消灭了旷课现象。今年上半年职工学习成绩及格率达84％强。
    养路工程事务所的工作单位分散，生产组织经常变动，职工文化程度不齐。扫盲工作就根据这些具体情况，采取了班、组、包教包学和自学、小先生等学习形式。同级学员在十五人以上的编成班，同级学员三人到十五人的编成小组，同级学员不足三人又有教员的实行包教包学，人少没有教员但有点基础能自学的就组织自学，人少又不能自学的就采取子教父妻教夫等找小先生的办法来学习。
    养路工程事务所用就地取材的办法解决了扫盲教师的来源。
    养路工程事务所在开展扫盲运动以前，党、政、工、团、业余学校等方面的负责人进行了研究、分析。首先，了解文盲、教员的人数、分布和思想情况。在这基础上，又用大会动员、群众互助动员和个别说服的方法进行了宣传。
