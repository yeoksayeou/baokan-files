According to the Qingdao Daily, since the second half of this year, many private personnel in Qingdao's foreign trade organizations have utilized their experience and expertise in finding sources of goods and organizing exports, and have made significant achievements.

Yuan Boping, a private staff member of the Arts and Crafts Export Company who has been involved in the straw braid business for more than 30 years, noticed that the foreign market welcomed straw braids with a width of ten to eighteen fen. He thought of the "Bridge Braid" produced in the Huiji Bridge area of ​​Henan Province, which met this standard, so he suggested that the company organize the export of "Bridge Braid" and personally went deep into the production area to provide guidance, restoring the export of the "Bridge Braid" that had been interrupted for many years. Sun Guoce, a blind private staff member of the company, after researching with his wife Cao Yunxun, resumed the export of hair buns, braids, and false eyelashes, which had been interrupted. Sun Huafeng, a private staff member of the Native Produce Export Branch, has relatively rich experience in operating small native products. In his work, he pays attention to closely combining the organization of goods sources and the organization of export work, so that the procurement tasks of commodities such as walnuts and black dates are completed according to plan. Zhou Yutang and Zhang Songgao, two private staff members of the company, through long-term research, coupled with the support of relevant departments, researched that Sophora japonica rice can replace imported salt-based yellow as a dye for dyeing kraft paper and yellow coated paper; now Qingdao Huadong Paper Mill has begun to use this dye to dye paper. It is estimated that if all paper mills in the city use this dye, the country can save foreign exchange equivalent to 180,000 yuan per year. Cai Ziming, a private staff member of Qingdao Aquatic Products Company under the Food Export Branch, studied the characteristics of cabbage (kohlrabi) and found a way to maintain the freshness of the cabbage, enabling the cabbage to be sold to Hong Kong and Southeast Asian markets. Cai Ziming also learned the Soviet method of storing vegetables, further extending the storage time of cabbage.

    青岛市对外贸易机构中
    许多私方人员充分发挥特长
    本报讯　据青岛日报报道：今年下半年以来，青岛市对外贸易机构中的不少私方人员在寻找货源和组织出口方面发挥了自己的经验和特长，并且作出了显著成绩。
    工艺品出口公司经营草帽辫三十多年的私方人员原伯平，看到国外市场欢迎十至十八分宽的草帽辫，他想到河南省惠济桥一带生产的“桥辫”符合这样标准，便建议公司组织“桥辫”出口，并亲自深入产地指导，将生产中断多年的
  “桥辫”恢复了出口。该公司双目失明的私方人员孙国策，经过和他妻子曹芸荪共同研究，将中断了出口的发髻、发辫和假睫毛等恢复了出口。土产出口分公司私方人员孙华峰，对经营小土产有比较丰富的经验，他在工作中注意把组织货源和组织出口工作密切结合起来，使核桃、乌枣等商品的收购任务按计划完成。该公司私方人员周宇唐和张松高二人，经长期钻研，加上有关部门的支持，研究出槐米可以代替进口的盐基黄做染牛皮纸和黄有光纸的染料；现在青岛市华东造纸厂已开始采用这种染料染纸。据估计，如果全市造纸厂都采用这种染料，每年可为国家节约相当于十八万元的外汇。食品出口分公司青岛水产公司私方人员蔡子铭，研究了椰菜（大头菜）的特点，找出保持菜身鲜度的办法，使椰菜能够远销香港和东南亚市场。蔡子铭还学习了苏联储藏蔬菜的办法，进一步延长了椰菜的保存时间。
