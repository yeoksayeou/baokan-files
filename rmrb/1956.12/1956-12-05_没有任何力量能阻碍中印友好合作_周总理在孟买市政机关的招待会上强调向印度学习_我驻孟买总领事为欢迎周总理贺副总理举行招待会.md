Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, December 4th. Premier Zhou Enlai said at the reception held by the Bombay municipal authorities last night: "The Himalayas did not prevent our ancestors from developing relations between India and China. Today, no force in the world can prevent us from further developing our friendship and cooperation." All those present at the reception for the Chinese guests responded to Zhou Enlai's words with thunderous applause.

　　The reception was held in the Kamala Nehru Park, named after the late wife of the Indian Prime Minister, under trees decorated with colored light bulbs. The park is located on a mountain overlooking the Arabian Sea.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai said that Bombay is a city that has won the respect of the Chinese people. "We are very familiar with Bombay's glorious past in the Indian people's struggle against colonialism. Today, as the Indian people are enthusiastically engaged in national construction, Bombay is once again playing an important role."

　　Zhou Enlai said that through this visit he learned that Bombay has a good foundation for developing industry and rich traditions of culture, art, science, and technology. All of this will be of great value to India's industrialization. He said:

　　"Bombay has done a lot for your country's first Five-Year Plan. I am sure that it will continue to make important contributions during your second Five-Year Plan."

　　Premier Zhou said that he was very happy to hear that the Mayor of Tianjin has invited the Mayor of Bombay to visit China at the end of this month. "I hope that the mayors of Chinese cities will also have the opportunity to visit Bombay and learn as much as possible from you."

　　Zhou Enlai said that Chinese students should be sent to Bombay to study. "Our two countries can exchange experiences in economics, culture, art, science, medicine, and other fields, and Bombay should be one of the centers for Chinese students to engage in this kind of learning."

　　Zhou Enlai then said: "We all remember that in the difficult days of our war against Japanese aggression, we received brotherly help from medical teams from India." He also said that the medical team included the great son of Bombay, Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis, who gave his life for the Chinese people.

　　"This alone makes the Chinese people remember the name of Dr. Kotnis and the great Bombay in their hearts."

　　Bombay Mayor Kader said in his welcoming speech: "Our two countries are old friends. No two countries have maintained such long and continuous exchanges as India and China, and no other two nations have achieved such spiritual and cultural intimacy as we have."

　　He continued, "The traditional friendship between our two countries has grown in recent years, and freedom can flourish unconstrained among us. Your unforgettable visit to New Delhi in June 1954 and the great Panchsheel principles adopted under the inspiration of Your Excellency and our Prime Minister mark another milestone in the amity and goodwill between our two countries. The idea of peaceful coexistence that you helped to initiate at that time has been increasingly observed in the world. In our two countries, mutual contact has been frequent recently, which is right, because our basic problems are similar. India has learned many valuable things from the pioneering actions of your people in building their motherland."

　　He concluded, "Let us hope that your visit to India will bring the people of our two countries closer together, benefit each other, and bring happiness to mankind."

　　Among those attending the reception were the Chief Minister of Bombay Province and other officials, as well as consuls from various countries.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Bombay, December 4th. Chinese Consul General in Bombay, Zhang Jiping, held a reception on the evening of December 3 to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long.

　　On the afternoon of the 3rd, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long met with overseas Chinese residing in Bombay in the garden of the Chinese Consulate General in Bombay and took a group photo.

　　没有任何力量能阻碍中印友好合作
　　周总理在孟买市政机关的招待会上强调向印度学习
　　我驻孟买总领事为欢迎周总理贺副总理举行招待会
    新华社孟买4日电　周恩来总理在昨晚孟买市政机关举行的招待会上说：“喜马拉雅山没有能够妨碍我们祖先发展印度和中国之间的关系。今天世界上没有任何力量能够妨碍我们进一步发展我们的友谊和合作。”所有出席这次为中国客人举行的招待会的人都对周恩来的这番话报以雷鸣般的掌声。
    招待会是在以印度总理的已故夫人的名字命名的卡马拉·尼赫鲁公园里装饰着彩色灯泡的树下举行的。这个公园座落在俯瞰阿拉伯海的一座山上面。
    周恩来总理说，孟买是一个赢得了中国人民的尊敬的城市。“我们很熟悉孟买在印度人民反对殖民主义斗争中的光荣的过去。今天当印度人民热情地投身于国家建设工作的时候，孟买正在又一次发挥着重要的作用。”
    周恩来说，他通过这次访问了解到，孟买有着发展工业的良好基础以及丰富的文化、艺术、科学和技术的传统。所有这一切对于印度的工业化会有很大的价值。他说：
  “孟买已经为你们国家的第一个五年计划作了很多事情。我确信在你们的第二个五年计划期间，它将继续作出重要的贡献。”
    周总理说，他很高兴听说天津市长已经邀请孟买市长在本月底访问中国。“我希望中国各城市的市长们也有机会访问孟买，并且尽可能多地向你们学习”。
    周恩来说，应当派中国学生到孟买来学习。“我们两国可以在经济、文化、艺术、科学、医学和其他方面交流经验，而孟买应当是中国学生从事这种学习的中心之一”。
    周恩来接着说：“我们都记得，在我们反抗日本侵略的战争的艰难日子里，我们曾经得到来自印度的医疗队的兄弟的帮助”。他又说，在这个医疗队里就有孟买的伟大儿子柯棣华医师，他为中国人民献出了自己的生命。
      “单是这件事就使中国人民在心里铭记着柯棣华的名字和伟大的孟买”。
    孟买市长卡德尔在欢迎词中说：“我们两国是老朋友。没有两个国家像印度和中国这样保持了这么长和这样连续不断的交往，没有另外两个民族像我们这样达到这样的精神上和文化上的亲密关系”。
    他继续说，“我们两国之间的传统的友谊已经在最近几年中成长起来，自由能够在我们中间不受约束地欣欣向荣。您在1954年6月在新德里作的令人难忘的访问以及在阁下和我们总理的鼓舞下采取的伟大的潘查希拉原则，标志着我们两国之间的亲睦和善意的又一个里程碑。您在当时帮助倡立的和平共处的思想已经在世界上日益得到遵守。在我们两国之间，相互的接触近来是频繁了，这是对的，因为我们的基本问题是相似的。印度已经从贵国人民为了建设祖国而作的前驱行动中学到了许多宝贵的东西。”
    他最后说，“让我们希望，你这次到印度来访问会使我们两国人民更加接近，使彼此得到好处，使人类得到幸福。”
    参加招待会的有孟买省的首席部长和其他官员以及各国的领事。
    新华社孟买4日电　中国驻孟买总领事张吉平为欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在12月3日晚举行招待会。
    到会的有孟买邦首席部长恰范和政府官员、文化艺术界人士、社会名流以及外国领事馆人员共二百多人。
    3日下午，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理在中国驻孟买总领事馆花园接见旅居孟买的华侨并合影留念。
    周总理对一百多位侨胞说，印度是我们友好的国家，侨胞们应当遵守印度的法律和当地的风俗习惯。总理还强调虚心向印度学习。他说，印度有很多方面值得我们学习。周总理最后号召侨胞加强团结。
