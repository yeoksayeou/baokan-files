Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 26th. The three counties of Longxi, Haicheng, and Changle in Fujian Province have achieved their plan to become "Thousand-Jin Counties" for rice. The total output of more than 540,000 mu of double-cropping rice in the three counties reached more than 571.91 million jin. Longxi County achieved an average yield of 1,081 jin per mu, exceeding the original plan by 77 jin and increasing by 35% compared to 1953, the best harvest year in the past. Haicheng County achieved an average yield of 1,005 jin per mu, an increase of 12.5% compared to 1953. Changle County achieved an average yield of 1,003 jin per mu, an increase of 22.7% compared to 1955. Sixty-six townships in these three counties have become "Thousand-Jin Townships" for rice. Lianhua Township in Haicheng County even saw a large-scale high-yield record of more than 7,730 mu of double-cropping rice averaging 1,455 jin per mu.

Longxi and Haicheng counties are located in the lower reaches of the Jiulong River in southern Fujian, with a warm climate and fertile soil. Changle County is located in the lower reaches of the Minjiang River. This year, these three counties were attacked by natural disasters such as floods, droughts, insects, typhoons, and alkaline tides, and the situation was quite serious. However, these three counties have already achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization, thus being able to give full play to collective strength and overcome various natural disasters. More than 1,800 water conservancy projects built by farmers in Longxi and Haicheng counties before the spring plowing played a significant role in combating drought and draining floods. Agricultural cooperatives in various places also accumulated much more fertilizer than in previous years, universally promoted improved rice varieties, and implemented a series of technological reforms centered on close planting.

After the bumper harvest in these three counties, members of the agricultural cooperatives are drying and cleaning the new grain, preparing to sell more surplus grain to the state. According to preliminary surveys and estimates by agricultural cooperatives in Longxi and Haicheng counties, in addition to completing the task of paying public grain and selling surplus grain to the state, they can sell more than 10 million jin of surplus grain to the state.

    充分发挥集体力量战胜各种自然灾害
    福建省出现三个水稻“千斤县”
    新华社福州26日电　福建省龙溪、海澄和长乐三个县实现了水稻“千斤县”的计划。三个县共五十四万多亩双季水稻，总产量达到五亿七千一百九十一万多斤。龙溪县每亩平均产量一千零八十一斤，超过原定计划七十七斤，比过去收成最好的1953年增加35％。海澄县每亩平均产量一千零五斤，比1953年增加12.5％。长乐县每亩平均产量一千斤零六两，比1955年增加22.7％。这三个县有六十六个乡成为水稻“千斤乡”。海澄县莲花乡还出现七千七百三十多亩双季水稻平均每亩产一千四百五十五斤的大面积丰产纪录。
    龙溪和海澄两县在福建南部九龙江下游，气候温暖，土壤肥沃。长乐县在闽江下游。今年这三个县分别受到水、旱、虫、台风、碱潮等自然灾害的袭击，情况相当严重。但是，这三个县都已经实现农业高级合作化，因而能够充分发挥集体力量，战胜了各种自然灾害。龙溪、海澄两县农民春耕前兴修的一千八百多处水利工程，在抗旱排洪中起了重大作用。各地农业社还积了超过往年很多的肥料，普遍推广了水稻良种，实行了以密植为中心的一系列技术改革。
    这三个县丰收以后，农业社的社员们正在把新谷晒干扬净，准备多卖余粮给国家。据龙溪和海澄两个县的农业社初步调查估算，在完成向国家缴公粮和售余粮的任务之外，还可以多卖给国家余粮一千多万斤。
