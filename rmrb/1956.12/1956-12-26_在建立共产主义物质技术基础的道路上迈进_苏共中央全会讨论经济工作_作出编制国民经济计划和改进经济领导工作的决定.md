Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, Moscow, December 24th (TASS): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session from December 20th to 24th.

The Central Committee plenary session discussed the following issues:

(1) Comrades Baibakov and Saburov's report on completing the work of compiling the Sixth Five-Year Plan and on determining the control figures for 1956-1960 and the guidelines for the 1957 national economic plan.

(2) Comrade Bulganin's report on improving the leadership of the Soviet national economy.

The plenary session made corresponding resolutions on the issues discussed.

Since Comrade Shepilov had been appointed as the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, the plenary session relieved Comrade Shepilov of his duties as Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, December 25th, Moscow (TASS): In its resolution on completing the work of compiling the Sixth Five-Year Plan and on determining the control figures for 1956-1960 and the guidelines for the 1957 national economic plan, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union explained the great achievements of the Soviet Union in developing the national economy in 1956. The achievements in socialist industry in this year indicate that the Soviet Union has taken a new step forward on the road of building the material and technical foundation of communism. In terms of the development of socialist industry, especially heavy industry, the entire annual plan for industrial production in 1956 will be overfulfilled. The output of industrial products will increase by about 11% compared to 1955, with the production of means of production increasing by more than 11% and the production of consumer goods increasing by more than 9%. In agriculture, due to the reclamation of 35.5 million hectares of virgin land in a short period of time, the state's procurement and purchase volume increased—grain increased by more than one billion poods compared to 1955, potatoes increased by 2.7 million tons, and milk increased by 3.8 million tons. The procurement volume of cotton, wool, and other agricultural products also increased. The production volume of consumer goods has also increased significantly. In 1956, light industry supplied residents with products exceeding the plan by 3 billion rubles, and the food industry's supply exceeded the plan by 4 billion rubles. The resolution also listed the major measures taken in 1956 to further improve the people's material welfare and cultural level.

In this resolution, the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee also made five decisions on quickly eliminating shortcomings in the national economic plan and correctly utilizing all resources and potentials to ensure the further planned development of the national economy.

The resolution emphasized that the entire historical experience of the Soviet state, as well as the experience of other socialist countries after the war, undeniably and convincingly proves that the socialist economic system is far superior to the capitalist system. The reactionary forces in the capitalist world's attempts to slander the socialist economic system and distort its essence are bound to fail. The resolution stated that the current task of the Party is to better and more fully utilize the extremely great, world-historically significant advantages of the socialist system and the socialist economic system to benefit the people and build communism.

In its resolution on improving the leadership of the Soviet national economy, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward six decisions on fundamentally improving the annual planning work of the Soviet State Economic Commission, eliminating excessive centralization in economic management, enhancing the role of the republics in economic construction, further expanding the powers of Soviet ministries, economic management agencies, and enterprises, streamlining administrative management organs, and improving trade union work. The resolution stated that the measures implemented by the Party and the government fully comply with Lenin's principles of socialist management, which are based on democratic centralism in the leadership of economic construction.

The resolution called on all Party organizations and all Communist Party members to resolutely implement the tasks set by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, namely, to further develop the socialist economy of the Soviet Union, improve organizational work, improve the methods of leadership over economic construction based on the Leninist principles of socialist management, and strive to give full play to the creative initiative and enthusiasm of the working people.

    在建立共产主义物质技术基础的道路上迈进
    苏共中央全会讨论经济工作
    作出编制国民经济计划和改进经济领导工作的决定
    新华社25日讯　塔斯社莫斯科24日电：苏联共产党中央委员会12月20日到24日举行了全体会议。
    中央委员会全会讨论了下列问题：
    （一）巴伊巴科夫同志和萨布罗夫同志关于完成编制第六个五年计划的工作以及关于确定1956—1960年的控制数字和1957年国民经济计划方针的报告。
    （二）布尔加宁同志关于改进苏联国民经济领导问题的报告。
    全会就讨论的问题作出了相应的决议。
    由于谢皮洛夫同志已经被任命为苏联外交部长，全会解除了谢皮洛夫同志苏共中央书记的职务。
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议在关于完成编制第六个五年计划的工作以及关于确定1956—1960年的控制数字和1957年国民经济计划方针的决议中，说明了1956年苏联发展国民经济的伟大成就。这一年在社会主义工业方面的成就，表明苏联在建立共产主义物质技术基础的道路上向前跨了新的一步。在社会主义工业、首先在重工业发展方面，1956年工业品生产的整个年度计划将超额完成。工业品的产量将比1955年约增加11％，其中生产资料的生产将增加11％以上，消费品的生产将增加9％以上。在农业方面，由于短时期内开垦了三千五百五十万公顷的生荒地，使国家的征购和收购量增加——粮食比1955年增加十亿多普特，马铃薯增加二百七十万吨，奶类增加三百八十万吨。棉花、毛类和其他农产品的征购量也都增加了。消费品的生产量也增加了很多。1956年轻工业供给居民的产品超过了计划三十亿卢布，食品工业的供应超过计划四十亿卢布。决议中还列举了1956年采取的关于进一步提高人民的物质福利和文化水平的重大措施。
    苏共中央全体会议并在这个决议中，就迅速消除国民经济计划中的缺点和正确地利用全部资源及潜力来保证国民经济的进一步有计划的发展，作出了五项决定。
    这个决议强调指出：苏维埃国家的全部历史经验以及战后其他社会主义国家的经验，无可争辩地和令人信服地证明，社会主义经济制度大大优越于资本主义制度。资本主义世界的反动势力千方百计地诬蔑社会主义经济制度和歪曲它的实质的企图必然会遭到失败。决议说，目前党的任务在于更好地、更充分地利用社会主义制度、社会主义经济制度的极其伟大的、具有世界历史意义的优越性去为人民造福，为共产主义建设造福。
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议在关于改进苏联国民经济领导问题的决议中，提出了关于根本改善苏联国家经济委员会的年度计划工作，消除经济管理上的过分集中现象，提高加盟共和国在经济建设中的作用，进一步扩大苏联各部、经济管理机构和企业的权力，精减行政管理机关和提高工会工作等六项决定。决议说，党和政府实行的措施充分符合列宁的社会主义经营原则，这些原则的基础是在经济建设领导工作中的民主集中制。
    决议号召一切党组织、所有的共产党员坚决实现苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所规定的任务，即进一步发展苏联的社会主义经济，改进组织工作，根据列宁主义的社会主义管理原则改进对经济建设的领导方法，竭力发挥劳动人民群众的创造主动精神和积极性。
