    Guangdong to Massively Promote Improved Varieties of Sugarcane and Jute

    (Our dispatch) Guangdong Province will massively promote superior varieties of sugarcane and jute next year. According to preliminary plans from the provincial agricultural departments, the cultivation area for improved sugarcane varieties will expand from 300,000 mu this year to 620,000 mu next year, primarily promoting high-yield, high-sugar content varieties such as "Taiwan Sugar No. 134" and "East Java 3016." Jute cultivation is planned to expand from over 140,000 mu this year to 340,000 mu, focusing on promoting the "Indian Round Fruit Variety."

    The improved varieties of sugarcane and jute promoted in Guangdong Province this year have generally increased production by over 20% compared to local varieties. Chao'an, Chenghai, and Zhuhai counties have earned the title of "10,000 Jin Per Mu Sugarcane Counties" due to the popularization of improved varieties and the implementation of advanced cultivation techniques such as deep pit flat bottoms. The First Agricultural Cooperative in Gonglian Township, Dongguan County, used improved jute varieties exclusively, and this year's average yield per mu exceeded 800 jin, nearly twice the provincial average yield.

    To complete next year's improved variety promotion plan, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has already established sugarcane improved variety breeding farms in Zhanjiang and Hepu special districts, and has stored over 20 million jin of superior seedlings, enough to expand the improved variety area next year. At the same time, more than 130,000 jin of "Indian Round Fruit Variety" have been purchased in Dongguan County, a major jute producing area.

    广东将要大量推广甘蔗和黄麻的良种
    本报讯　广东省明年将大量推广甘蔗和黄麻的优良品种。据省农业部门的初步计划，明年甘蔗良种的栽培面积要由今年的三十万亩扩大到六十二万亩，以推广产量高、含糖分多的“台糖一三四号”、“东爪哇三○一六号”等良种为主。黄麻计划由今年的十四万多亩扩大到三十四万亩，着重推广“印度园果种”。
    今年广东省所推广的甘蔗和黄麻良种，普遍比土种增产二成以上，潮安、澄海、珠海三个县由于普及良种和推行深坑平底等先进栽培技术，取得了“甘蔗每亩万斤县”的称号。东莞县共联乡第一农业社，全部采用黄麻的良种，今年平均每亩产麻八百斤以上，比全省的单位产量高出将近两倍。
    为了完成明年的良种推广计划，省农业厅已经在湛江、合浦两个专区各建一个甘蔗良种繁殖场，并且贮备了二千多万斤优良种苗，足够明年扩大良种面积之用。同时，还在盛产黄麻的东莞县收购了十三万多斤的“印度园果种”。
