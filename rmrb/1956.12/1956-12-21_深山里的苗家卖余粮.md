    Miao People in the Deep Mountains Sell Surplus Grain
    Guo Dingcheng
    These days, the Miao farmers in Jikaxiang, Jishou County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, are actively selling surplus grain to the state. Every morning, on the winding paths surrounding Jikaxiang, Miao selling-grain teams appear. Women carry bamboo baskets on their backs, and men carry loads on their shoulders. The small red flags stuck in the grain loads are like flowers blooming all over the hills.
    This year, although Jikaxiang suffered a severe drought unprecedented in history, the Miao farmers here not only completed the grain purchase quota of 680,000 jin but also sold an additional 120,000 jin of surplus grain.
    Since Jikaxiang's Miao farmers sold surplus grain even after suffering a severe drought this year, will this affect their rations? The facts from the Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative, with 36 households, answer this question. The Sanlian Cooperative harvested 107,323 jin of grain this year, exceeding the "three fixed" output by more than 16,000 jin. After completing the purchase task of 18,000 jin and selling 7,000 jin of surplus grain, each member received an average of 568 jin of grain, exceeding the local ration standard by 98 jin. 70% of the farmers in Jikaxiang have joined agricultural production cooperatives. This year, these agricultural cooperatives mostly increased production, exceeding the "three fixed" output by more than 200,000 jin in total.
    At the beginning of July this year, drought appeared in Jikaxiang: it hadn't rained for a long time, and the sun blazed all day long. Hot winds flowed through the valleys, dust rose in the terraced fields, the once-flowing streams dried up, the fields cracked, and the seedlings were about to wither! At this time, the Jikaxiang Party General Branch of the Chinese Communist Party proposed: mobilize the masses to find water sources and fight against the drought.
    Shi Qiude, the director of the Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative, responded to the Party's call and visited veteran herbalists who often went deep into the mountains to collect medicinal materials, asking where there might be water sources. An old herbalist told Shi Qiude: "At 'Xiaotianlong' that place, according to the elders, there is a spring flowing down from its belly."
    "Xiaotianlong" is on a cliff face on a towering precipice. The local Miao people named it "Xiaotianlong" because it truly resembles a dragon with its head held high, its two dragon whiskers like two sharp swords, piercing the sky.
    No one had ever climbed this steep "Xiaotianlong" before. Who would treat their life as a game? But upon hearing that there was a water source there, Liao Yuhong, a famous hunter in the Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative – a brave man, climbed onto Xiaotianlong by clinging to bamboo poles tied together, using his feet to push against the rock face, like a monkey. In the cave of Xiaotianlong, there was indeed a large pond formed by the constant seepage of water from the rocks. They channeled the cool, clear spring water from the pond into the dry terraced fields, irrigating the seedlings.
    In order to find more water sources, the farmers of Jikaxiang also braved the scorching sun, pushing aside dense layers of thorny vines to climb into the mountains; or they went to low-lying areas to dig wells. In this way, they found more than a hundred new water sources. In addition to finding water sources, the Miao women also widely carried out the practice of laying green grass in the fields to combat drought. After the green grass rotted, it was trampled into the rows of rice, becoming a very good fertilizer.
    The Miao farmers finally overcame the drought, and a widespread bumper harvest was achieved in the terraced fields of Jikaxiang. In the past, in these deep mountains, each mu of paddy field yielded an average of only two to three hundred jin of grain. This year, the average yield per mu reached 370 jin.
    The Miao farmer, Ma Laomei, originally had more than ten mu of mountain fields, which often lacked fertilizer and were affected by drought. Last year, he only harvested more than 2,400 jin of rice; even in the best years, he could only harvest 3,600 jin. This year, after joining the Sanlian Agricultural Cooperative, these ten mu of fields yielded 6,050 jin of dry rice, more than doubling last year's yield, and exceeding the best year by more than 2,000 jin. Ma Laomei said very happily: "Thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party, the agricultural cooperative was established, which enabled such a good harvest. We must sell more surplus grain to support the country's construction!"

    深山里的苗家卖余粮
    郭鼎诚
    这些日子，湘西苗族自治州吉首县吉卡乡的苗族农民正在积极地出卖余粮给国家，每天清晨，环绕着吉卡乡的山峦的羊肠道上，就出现了苗家的卖粮队，妇女们肩背竹篓，男人们挑着担子，插在粮担上的小红旗，像朵朵花儿开遍山岗。
    今年，吉卡乡虽然遭受了历史上从来没有过的大旱灾，但是，这里的苗族农民不仅完成了六十八万斤的粮食定购任务，而且还多卖了十二万斤余粮。
    吉卡乡的苗族农民在今年遭受了大旱灾后，还多卖了余粮，这样会不会使他们的口粮受到影响呢？三十六户的三联农业社的事实回答了这个问题。三联社今年收了十万零七千三百二十三斤粮食，比三定产量多收一万六千多斤，除完成一万八千斤的定购任务和卖了七千斤余粮外，每个社员平均还分到粮五百六十八斤，超过当地留口粮标准九十八斤。吉卡乡已有70％的农民参加了农业生产合作社，今年这些农业社大都增了产，总共超过三定产量二十多万斤。
    今年7月初，吉卡乡出现了旱象：天好久不下雨，整天赤日炎炎，热风在山谷中流荡，梯田里掀起了灰尘，过去长流不息的小河干涸了，田地龟裂开来，禾苗快干死啦！这时，中共吉卡乡党总支研究后提出：发动群众找水源，同旱灾作斗争。
    三联农业社主任石求德响应了党的号召，到处求访经常深入深山采药材的老药师们，打听什么地方有水源。一位年老的采药师告诉了石求德：“‘笑天龙’那地方，据前辈的老人们说，在它肚子里有一股泉水流下来。”
    “笑天龙”在一座高耸入云的峭壁悬崖的岩石上。当地苗族人民给它起名为“笑天龙”，是它真像一条昂首的龙，两根龙须像两把锋利的宝剑，刺入天空。
    这个笔陡的“笑天龙”从来就没有人爬上去过，谁愿意把生命当儿戏呢？可是听说那里有水源，三联农业社里的一个有名的猎手——勇敢的廖玉红，就攀着一根根连接起来的竹杆，用脚蹬着岩壁，像猴子一样地爬上了笑天龙。在笑天龙的岩洞里，果然有一个由于长年不断的岩石浸水积成的大塘。他们把塘里冰凉的清悠悠的泉水引到干旱的梯田里，浇灌着禾苗。
    为了寻找更多的水源，吉卡乡的农民还冒着炎炎的烈日，拨开密密层层的刺藤爬到丛山峻岭中去；或者到低洼的地方去挖掘水井。就这样他们又找到了一百多处新的水源。除了找水源外，苗族农妇们还普遍开展了打青草铺田抗旱，青草烂了，就踩在禾行子里，变成了很好的肥料。
    苗族农民终于战胜了旱灾，在吉卡乡的梯田里普遍获得了丰收。过去在这深山里，每亩稻田平均只收二百到三百斤粮食，今年每亩平均产量达到三百七十斤。
    苗族农民麻老妹，自己原来有十亩多山田，过去经常缺肥和遭旱，去年只收了稻谷二千四百多斤；即使在最好的年景，也只能收三千六百斤。今年他参加了三联农业社以后，这十亩多田打了干谷六千零五十斤，比去年增产一倍多，比最好的年成还多收二千多斤。麻老妹非常高兴地说：“搭帮共产党的领导，办起了农业社，才能有这样好的收成，我们一定要多卖余粮，支援国家的建设啊！”
