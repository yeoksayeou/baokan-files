Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council is scheduled to hold a four-to-five-day meeting in Paris on the 11th. Prior to the meeting, the Military Committee, composed of the chiefs of staff of the organization's fifteen member states, and the Council of Permanent Representatives have been holding meetings for days.

According to Western news agencies, the primary issue facing this meeting is to "restore unity within the Western alliance, which has been severely shaken, and strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." At this meeting, described as Dulles' "most difficult task in his diplomatic career," Dulles intends to "persuade" Britain, France, and the other twelve countries to "believe that the time has come to forget the divisions of the past few months and begin to cooperate," and is prepared to assure the Western European foreign ministers that "the United States is prepared to do everything possible to help Britain and other Western European countries through the crisis." British and French news agencies also reflect that the British and French governments believe that "the most important issue is to restore the trust between NATO and the Western European Union member states, which has been severely damaged by the Suez Canal crisis," and hope that the United States will supply oil. Agence France-Presse also reported that Britain and France also hope that the United States will "force Egypt to accept the necessary conditions" to "open" the Suez Canal.

These news agency reports also indicate that the meeting will discuss continuing to strengthen the aggressive military alliance and the arms race under the pretext of "Soviet interference in Hungary's internal affairs and attempts to intervene in the Middle East."

Another issue to be discussed at the meeting, according to UPI, is "efforts to expand NATO's political activities." A three-member committee composed of Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Italian Foreign Minister Martino, and Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange will submit a report to the Council meeting, "requesting NATO to pay more attention to internal political consultations so that any global issue can be raised for discussion, and not limited to issues within NATO's geographical area."

　  弥缝西方联盟裂痕　扩大侵略阴谋活动
　　北大西洋集团将举行会议
    据新华社9日讯　北大西洋公约组织理事会定于11日在巴黎举行为时四至五天的会议。会前，由这个组织的十五个成员国参谋长所组成的军事委员会和常任理事代表会连日举行了会议。
    据西方通讯社报道，这次会议所面临的首要问题，是“恢复被严重动摇了的西方联盟中的团结和加强北大西洋公约组织”。在这次被形容为杜勒斯“外交生涯中最困难的一次任务”的会议中，杜勒斯打算“说服”英法及其他十二个国家，要他们“相信忘却过去几个月中的分歧意见并开始合作的时间已经到来”，并且准备向西欧各国外长保证
  “美国准备尽一切力量帮助英国和其他西欧国家度过危机”。英国和法国通讯社也反映出，英法政府认为
  “最重要的问题是恢复北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟成员国之间的由于苏伊士运河危机而受到严重损害的信任”，并且希望美国供应石油。法新社的消息并且说：英法还希望美国“迫使埃及接受必要的条件”
  “开放”苏伊士运河。
    这些通讯社的消息还表明，会议将在所谓“苏联干涉匈牙利内政和企图插足中东”的借口下，讨论继续加强侵略性军事联盟和军备竞赛的问题。
    会议将要讨论的另一个问题，据合众社报道，是“努力扩大北大西洋公约组织在政治方面的活动”。由加拿大外长皮尔逊、意大利外长马蒂诺、挪威外长兰格所组成的三人委员会将向理事会会议提出一项报告，“要求北大西洋公约组织较多地注意于组织内部的政治协商，以便任何世界性问题都可以提出来讨论，而不仅限于讨论北大西洋公约组织的地理地区内的问题”。
