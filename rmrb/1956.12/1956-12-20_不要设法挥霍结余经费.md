    Don't Try to Squander Surplus Funds
    Recently, the Communist Youth League of Zhenjiang City is preparing to use the several thousand yuan of operating funds remaining from this year to purchase accordions, bicycles, typewriters, and other items. The city league committee only has twenty-odd cadres, and they already have an accordion that is rarely used, as well as several publicly owned bicycles. I believe that their purchase of these items now is not urgently needed for their work, but rather an intentional effort to squander the remaining funds. I hope relevant financial departments will inspect their expenditure situation and require them to turn over the remaining funds to the state to support industrial construction.

    不要设法挥霍结余经费
    最近，青年团镇江市委准备用今年结余的几千元事业费去购置手风琴、自行车、打字机等东西。团市委仅有二十几个干部，现有一架手风琴，很少有人使用，公用的自行车也有几辆。我认为，他们现在购置这些东西并不是工作上急需要的，而是有意要把结余的经费挥霍净尽。希望有关财务部门检查他们的经费开支情况，要他们把结余的经费上交国家，支援工业建设。
