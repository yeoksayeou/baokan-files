    Seven Years Without Damaging Goods
    Luo Lianke, a loading and unloading worker at Zhenjiang Port, has not damaged any goods in the seven years since liberation, and has bravely rescued state property on many occasions. Recently, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration rated him as an advanced producer for improving the quality of cargo transportation.
    Luo Lianke is cautious and attentive when working. Normally, to put a package carried on the shoulder down to the ground, one only needs to loosen the shoulder. But Luo Lianke knows that this can easily break things, so he would rather exert himself and always slowly bend down and gently put it down. Luo Lianke always carries a needle and thread with him, and when he sees a package torn, he often silently sews it up.
    This spring, thousands of bags of rice were piled up in the open-air cargo yard of Zhenjiang Port. One night, it suddenly started to rain. Luo Lianke was worried that the grain bags would get wet, and he couldn't sleep. As soon as it dawned, he rushed to the cargo yard to check. Sure enough, some water had leaked into the grain pile. Although it was not yet his team's working hours, he ran back to call the loaders in his team to come and rescue the rice together. In February of this year, a wooden boat fully loaded with stones was next to the No. 1 pier of Zhenjiang Port, and because the tide receded too quickly, it suddenly ran aground. Luo Lianke, who was working nearby, jumped into the water to push the boat, regardless of the cold. His brave action motivated everyone, and finally the wooden boat was freed from danger.

    七年多没有搬坏过货物
    镇江港装卸工人骆连科，解放七年多来没有搬坏过货物，并且多次奋勇地抢救过国家财产。最近，长江航运管理局评定他为提高货运质量先进生产者。
    骆连科工作起来谨慎小心，思想集中。本来，要把扛在肩上的货包放到地上去，把肩膀一松就可以了。但是骆连科知道这样容易摔坏东西，宁可自己吃力些，总是慢慢弯下腰，轻轻放下。骆连科总是随身带着针线，看到货包破了，常常一声不响地把它缝补好。
    今年春天，镇江港露天货场堆着几千包大米。一天夜里忽然下起雨来。骆连科耽心粮袋被雨打湿，翻来复去睡不着。天刚透亮，他就赶到货场去检查。果然粮堆里已经漏进一些水。这时虽然还不是他们小队的工作时间，他还是奔回去喊自己小队里的装卸工人一起来抢救。在今年2月间，镇江港第一码头旁边有一只满装着石块的木船因为潮水退得太快，突然搁浅。正在附近工作的骆连科不顾寒冷，跳下水去推船。他的奋勇行动带动了大家，终于使木船脱离了危险。（据新华社讯）
