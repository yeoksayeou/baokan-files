　　Anhui Launches Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Campaign

　　(Our report) Anhui Province has achieved significant results in schistosomiasis prevention and control this year. Millions of people have participated in snail eradication campaigns and comprehensive prevention and control efforts. According to statistics at the end of September this year, the number of households managing feces has reached more than 60% of the households that should be managed in the epidemic areas. The snail eradication area reached more than two million square meters, and more than 38,000 patients were treated. Since July this year, the province has organized a large number of personnel to investigate the prevalence of schistosomiasis, and to conduct investigations on ditches, ponds, rivers, and fields in and adjacent to the epidemic areas. As a result, 75 new schistosomiasis epidemic townships were discovered. So far, the scope of schistosomiasis prevalence in the province has been basically clarified. In the schistosomiasis epidemic areas, intradermal reaction tests were carried out on more than 2 million people, and stool examinations were carried out on more than 300,000 people, totaling more than 700 townships surveyed. This work laid the foundation for planned prevention and control of schistosomiasis in the future. In terms of treatment, both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have exerted great efforts, and traditional Chinese medicine has contributed hundreds of treatment prescriptions. Among them, "Lobelia chinensis," "Sapium sebiferum root bark," "Pig Ear Grass," and "Triple Alum Insecticidal Pills" and other prescriptions have significant effects on eliminating ascites in patients, reducing liver and spleen enlargement, and restoring patients' labor force.

　　Now, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to continue launching a large-scale comprehensive schistosomiasis prevention and control campaign this winter and spring. This campaign is about to be fully launched. In addition to requiring comprehensive management of feces, eliminating snails around villages and places where people frequently come into contact for production and life, paying attention to water source management and personal protection, and further experimenting with converting paddy fields to dry land, it is also required to complete the task of treating 80,000 patients throughout the year by the end of this year.

　　安徽开展防治血吸虫病运动
    本报讯　安徽省血吸虫病防治工作，今年已获得显著成绩。数百万群众参加了灭螺运动和综合性的防治工作。据今年9月底的统计，粪便管理的户数已达到流行区应管理户的60％多。灭螺面积达二百多万平方公尺，治疗的病人达三万八千多人。从今年7月起，全省组织了大批力量，调查血吸虫病的流行范围，对流行区及流行区毗连的沟、塘、河、田进行清查，结果新发现了七十五个血吸虫病流行乡。至此，全省血吸虫病的流行范围已基本摸清。在血吸虫病流行区内，还对二百多万人进行了皮内反应试验，对三十多万人进行了粪便检查，共普查了七百多个乡。这项工作，为今后有计划地防治血吸虫病打下基础。在治疗方面，中、西医都发挥了很大力量，中医贡献出的治疗方剂，达数百种。其中“半边莲”、“乌桕树根皮”、“猪耳草”、“三矾杀虫丸”等方剂，对消除病人腹水、减轻肝脾肿大，恢复病人劳动力有显著效果。
    现在，中共安徽省委，已决定在今冬明春，再继续开展一个大规模的综合防治血吸虫病运动，这一运动即将全面展开。除了要求全面管理粪便，消灭村庄周围和人民生产生活常接触地方的钉螺，注意水源管理和个人防护，进一步试验水田改旱地外，并要求在今年年底前完成全年治疗八万病人的任务。
