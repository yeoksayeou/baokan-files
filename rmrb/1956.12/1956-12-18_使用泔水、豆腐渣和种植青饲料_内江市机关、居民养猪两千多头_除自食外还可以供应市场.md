Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 14th. Organs, factories, mines, and residents in Neijiang City, Sichuan, have raised over two thousand pigs. In November, besides consuming them themselves, they also sold ninety-three fat pigs to the food company. It is estimated that over two hundred fat pigs can be supplied to the market by the Spring Festival.

These pigs are raised using swill from canteens (a mixture of dirty water and leftover food scraps from cooking and washing dishes), tofu dregs from tofu shops, and green fodder grown on open spaces, which costs little money and does not require grain. The Neijiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Neijiang Commissioner's Office, for example, rely solely on the above feed, managed by a cook in his spare time, to raise sixteen fat pigs, with two to three fat pigs being sold each month. Liu, an old woman, a resident of Jiefang Road, used swill from restaurants to fatten two pigs within a year, which she sold to the state. Recently, she purchased two more piglets.

At the end of November, the Neijiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office Finance and Economic Committee studied the issue of urban residents raising pigs, believing that it conformed to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy and also played a certain role in improving pork supply. It decided to promote the raising of pigs by organs, organizations, factories, mines, enterprises, and residents with suitable conditions.

    使用泔水、豆腐渣和种植青饲料
    内江市机关、居民养猪两千多头
    除自食外还可以供应市场
    新华社成都14日电　四川内江市机关厂矿和居民饲养了二千多头生猪，11月份除自己食用外还卖给食品公司九十三头肥猪，预计到春节时可供应市场肥猪二百多头。
    这些猪都是使用食堂的泔水（作饭、洗碗后的脏水和剩饭剩菜的混合物）、豆腐店的豆渣和空地上种植的青饲料饲养的，花钱少又不用粮食。中共内江地委会和内江专员公署两单位就是仅靠以上的饲料由一个厨工兼管即喂养了十六头肥猪，每月都有二到三头肥猪出槽。解放路居民刘老婆婆用饭馆的泔水一年内喂肥了两头肥猪卖给国家，最近她又购进了两头小猪。
    11月底内江专署财政经济委员会研究了城市居民养猪的问题，认为这符合增产节约精神，又对改善猪肉供应起一定作用，决定提倡有条件的机关团体厂矿企业和居民增养生猪。
