Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to TASS, the famous Soviet engineer Malkin said that currently, over 400 hydroelectric and thermoelectric power stations are under construction throughout the Soviet Union, with a total power generation capacity of tens of millions of kilowatts.

In a recently published booklet, Malkin also stated that the development of power engineering in the eastern regions of the Soviet Union is receiving particular attention. The world's largest Bratsk Hydroelectric Station and Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station, each with a power generation capacity of 3.2 million kilowatts, are under construction there, in addition to several other large hydroelectric stations. By 1960, the eastern region will produce 130 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which is almost equal to the total electricity generated by the Soviet Union in 1953.

Malkin pointed out that due to the tremendous development of power engineering, the Soviet Union now produces as much electricity daily as it did in the entire year of 1920. During the new Five-Year Plan period, when the Soviet Union's electricity production reaches 320 billion kilowatts, the increase in five years will exceed the current total electricity production of Britain and France combined. According to rough estimates, the Soviet Union's electricity production will exceed one trillion kilowatt-hours by 1970, and will increase to twelve trillion to fifteen trillion kilowatt-hours by 2000. By that time, the average electricity consumption per person in the Soviet Union will be 35,000 to 40,000 kilowatt-hours per year.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: Design work on another larger hydroelectric station in the Soviet Union—the Yenisei Hydroelectric Station with a power generation capacity of 5 million kilowatts—is nearing completion. In the near future, it will replace the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station and Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station currently under construction on the Angara River and Yenisei River in Siberia, and become the world's largest hydroelectric station.

The huge Yenisei Hydroelectric Station's dam and power plant will be built north of the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station, near the city of Yeniseisk on the banks of the Yenisei River.

The power generation capacity of the currently world's largest Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Stations will be increased. After careful research, Soviet scientists have decided to increase the power generation capacity of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station from 3.2 million kilowatts to 3.6 million kilowatts; they also believe that the power generation capacity of the Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station can also be increased from 3.2 million kilowatts to 4 million kilowatts.

Our Newspaper Moscow, December 17th: The tenth generator of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station has been installed and has begun generating electricity. So far, the power generation capacity of this still-under-construction hydroelectric station has reached 1.05 million kilowatts. Although this is only half of the designed total power generation capacity, it has already made the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station the largest existing power station in the entire Soviet Union and Europe. It now generates 17 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. The installation of ten giant generators in less than a year is a speed unprecedented in the history of hydroelectric station construction worldwide. The construction workers of the hydroelectric station held a meeting on the 14th to congratulate the commissioning of the tenth generator and the completion of the annual plan. They decided to install and commission two more generators before the end of the year. (Attached picture)

    振奋人心的伟大共产主义建设
    苏联正在建设四百多个发电站
    世界上最大的叶尼塞水电站的设计工作将近完成
    古比雪夫水电站已成为全欧洲现有的最大发电站
    新华社讯　据塔斯社消息：著名的苏联工程师马尔金说，目前，苏联全国各地正在建设四百多个水电站和热电站，它们的总发电能力有几千万瓩。
    马尔金在最近出版的一本小册子上还说，苏联东部地区动力工程的发展特别受到注意，那里正在建设发电能力各为三百二十万瓩的世界上最大的布拉次克水电站和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站，另外还建设其他一些巨大的水电站。到1960年，东部地区每年将生产一千三百亿度电力，这差不多等于1953年苏联全国的发电量。
    马尔金指出，由于电力工程的巨大发展，苏联现在每天生产的电力已经等于1920年全年的电力生产量。在新五年计划期间，苏联的电力生产将达到三千二百亿瓩时，五年中的增加额将超过英国和法国现在电力生产的总和。根据粗略的估计，1970年苏联的电力产量将超过一万亿度，而到2000年，就将增加到十二万亿到十五万亿度。到那时候，按人口平均计算，苏联每人每年将可以分到三万五千到四万度的电力。
    新华社莫斯科电　苏联的另一个规模更大的水电站——发电能力达五百万瓩的叶尼塞水电站的设计工作将近完成。不久的将来，它将代替目前正在西伯利亚安加拉河和叶尼塞河上建设的布拉次克水电站和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站，而成为世界上最大的水电站。
    巨大的叶尼塞水电站的堤坝和电力厂将建筑在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站的北部，位于叶尼塞河岸边的叶尼塞斯克城附近。
    目前世界上最大的布拉次克和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站的发电能力将得到提高。经过缜密的研究，苏联科学家已经决定把布拉次克水电站的发电能力从三百二十万瓩提高到三百六十万瓩；他们还认为，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站的发电能力也可以从三百二十万瓩提高到四百万瓩。
    本报莫斯科17日电　古比雪夫水电站的第十部发电机已经安装好并且开始发电了。至此，这座尚未完工的水电站的发电能力已经达到一百零五万瓩。这虽然只是设计的全部发电能力的一半，但已经使古比雪夫水电站成为全苏联和全欧洲现有的最大发电站了。它现在每昼夜发电一千七百万度。在不到一年的时间安装了十部巨型发电机，这样高的速度在世界水电站建筑史上还是未曾有过的。水电站的建筑工人们在14日集会祝贺第十部发电机的送电和年度计划的完成。他们决定在年底以前再装好两部发电机并使它们发电。（附图片）
