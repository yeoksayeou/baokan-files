Repudiating the Lifestyle of a Prodigal Son
Ma Tieding

The People's Daily published an article on page eight entitled "Just Because It's Not Their Own Money." This article criticizes the phenomenon of rushing to spend money and mocks those who are stingy with their own money but spend public funds lavishly. This reminds me of a related question: does the fact that someone spends their own money lavishly give them the right to spend public funds lavishly?

Before answering this question, the images of other people appear in my mind: you say they are stingy with their own money? That's really unfair. They are also quite extravagant when spending their own money. Due to family environment or other reasons, they have developed a habit that money comes easily and goes quickly. They can really spend thousands of dollars without batting an eye. They love pomp and circumstance, and everything they wear, eat, and use must be the best. As things develop, whether something is really the best becomes secondary; the main thing is which item costs the most, and they will spare no expense to get it by any means.

If people with a prodigal lifestyle or who are influenced by a prodigal lifestyle, once they have control of financial power, economic power, or are in charge of a department or a region, and their habit of extravagance has not been resolutely changed, they will often abuse public funds like flowing water. Here, two aspects are worth studying: on the one hand, can an individual's money, even if it is all the labor remuneration given to them by society, be used "as they please"? Generally speaking, one's own labor income can be used in any way one wants, and no one can interfere. However, those who use money should also consider that they should not allow their living standards to deviate too far from the general social living standards. If they do, they will become detached from the masses; people are social beings, and wasteful behavior can only contribute to the pursuit of luxury and harm the formation of a social atmosphere that advocates thrift.

Our Constitution solemnly states: "The public property of the People's Republic of China is sacred and inviolable. It is the duty of every citizen to cherish and protect public property." (Article 101) Isn't extravagance and waste in contradiction with the spirit of "cherishing," "protecting," and "sacred and inviolable," and even running in the opposite direction?

We are not ascetics, and we do not fundamentally oppose gradually improving our living and working conditions (such as buying sofas, electric fans, etc.), but we say that this improvement must be adapted to the development of our production. In recent years, our production has made great progress, but on the whole, the production level is still relatively low. China is a large country with a population of 600 million, and its annual steel production is only over 4 million tons, which is less than that of Belgium, which has a population of over 8 million. Under these circumstances, we can only spend our limited money on the most useful things.

The editors of the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" once wrote this editor's note: "In the cooperativization movement in Zunhua County, there was a Wang Guofan cooperative, with twenty-three poor peasant households and only three donkey legs, which was called the 'poor stick cooperative.' Through their own efforts, they 'brought from the mountains' a large number of means of production in three years, which moved some visitors to tears. I think this is the image of our entire country."

How far apart are the "image of the country" mentioned here and the image of the prodigal son who is extravagant? When you rush to spend money, flip through the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"! Think about the golden words in that editor's note! Learn from the spirit of Wang Guofan's cooperative in running the cooperative diligently and thriftily!

    斥浪荡子作风
    马铁丁
    人民日报第八版发表了一篇文章，题为“只因不是自家钱”。这文章对突击花钱的现象，加以批评；对用自己的钱，一钱如命，用公款挥金如土的人加以嘲讽。由此我想起了一个与此有关的问题，那就是：用自己的钱挥金如土的人，是不是用公款就有权利挥金如土？
    在回答这个问题之前，我的脑子里出现了另一些人的形象：这些人，你说他对自己的钱，一钱如命，那实在是冤枉的。他们自己花钱的时候，也是泼泼辣辣的。由于家庭环境或其他原因，养成他们一种习性，钱来容易，也就特别去得快。真可以做到一掷千金，若无其事。他们爱排场、喜讲究，穿的、吃的、用的一切都要最好的。发展到后来，究竟是不是最好的东西，那在其次，主要是哪样东西花钱最多，他就一定不惜重金，千方百计弄到手。
    这种有着浪荡子作风或受浪荡子作风所影响的人，一旦掌握财权、经济权或负责一个部门、一个地区的工作，他那挥霍成性的习惯又没有坚决加以改变的话，也常常会滥用公款，势如流水。在这里又有两方面值得研究：一方面是个人的钱，哪怕全部是社会给自己的劳动报酬，是不是就可以“随心所欲”？一般地说，自己的劳动所得，要怎末用就怎末用，任何人不能干涉。但是，用钱的人，也应该考虑到，不要使自己的生活水平脱离一般社会生活水平过远，如果这样，那是会脱离群众的；人是社会的人，挥霍的行为只能有助于竞逐豪华而有损于崇尚俭朴的社会风气之形成。
    我们的宪法上庄严地写着：“中华人民共和国的公共财产神圣不可侵犯。爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务。”（第一百零一条）挥霍浪费，难道不正是和“爱护”、“保卫”、“神圣不可侵犯”的精神相抵触，乃至背道而驰吗？
    我们并不是禁欲主义者，并不是从根本上来反对逐步改善我们的生活条件和工作条件（例如买沙发、电扇之类），而是说这种改善必须和我们的生产事业的发展相适应。几年来，我们的生产事业是有巨大发展的，但总的说来生产水平还是比较低的。我国是拥有六亿人口的大国，钢仅仅年产四百多万吨，还不及八百多万人口的比利时。在这种情况下，我们只能把有限的钱花到最有用的地方去。
    “中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书的编者曾经写下这样的按语：“遵化县的合作化运动中，有一个王国藩合作社，二十三户贫农只有三条驴腿，被人称为‘穷棒子社’。他们用自己的努力，在三年时间内，‘从山上取来’了大批的生产资料，使得有些参观的人感动得下泪。我看这就是我们整个国家的形象。”
    这里所说的“国家的形象”和那挥霍成性的浪荡子的形象相去何远？当你突击花钱的时候，你翻一翻“中国农村的社会主义高潮”这本书吧！你想一想那按语中的金石之言吧！你学一学王国藩合作社勤俭办社的精神吧！
