    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 17th, TASS dispatch: French police arrested Figuères, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, on the 16th. This arrest was to enforce a military tribunal's verdict on Figuères as early as 1950. At that time, Figuères was sentenced to seven years in prison for writing a book strongly opposing the colonial war in Vietnam. However, the verdict was made in the absence of the defendant and was never published anywhere.
    "L'Humanité" demands the immediate release of Figuères. The newspaper emphasized that his struggle was to stop the unjust colonial war condemned by the French people.

    法共中委斐盖尔被捕
    新华社17日讯　塔斯社巴黎讯：法国警察在16日逮捕了法国共产党中央委员会委员斐盖尔。这次逮捕是执行军事法庭早在1950年对斐盖尔的判决。当时斐盖尔被判处了七年的徒刑，因为他写书坚决反对在越南的殖民战争。而这次判决是在被告缺席的情况下作出的，并且没有在任何地方公布。
    “人道报”要求立即释放斐盖尔。报纸强调指出，他的斗争是为了制止遭到法国人民谴责的、不正义的殖民战争。
