Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 18th: Hubei Province has increased grain production by more than 2 billion jin this year. In addition to fulfilling the public grain and state procurement tasks, farmers in various places still have considerable surplus grain in their hands. Recalling the 1954 floods that affected the entire province, and the assistance of grain, seeds and other materials from other places, many farmers have sold their surplus grain to the state to support the people in Hebei, Jiangsu and other provinces that suffered severe disasters this year. As of the 9th, they had sold more than 234 million jin of increased grain to the state. In the old revolutionary base area of Hongan County, members of the 35 agricultural cooperatives in the Liulin Township, such as Hongping, Hongdong, and Anbei, put forward the slogan "Sell more increased grain, so that the people in disaster areas can eat their fill." In just three days, they sold 220,000 jin of increased grain.

Xinhua News Agency, Liaocheng, 18th: In Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, which has had a bumper harvest of grain and cotton, many agricultural cooperatives are enthusiastically selling more surplus grain to support national construction. After the entire prefecture completed its grain requisition and purchase tasks in early November, more than 390 grain purchasing stations in various places still purchased an average of more than 1.6 million jin of grain per day. As of December 15, the total amount of grain requisitioned and purchased in the entire prefecture had reached 30,342,000 jin, exceeding the original task by more than 27%. During this period, the amount of grain on the market in more than 330 free markets in the prefecture averaged more than 343,000 jin per market day, more than double the previous amount.

This year, more than 3,700 advanced agricultural cooperatives in Liaocheng Prefecture (with the number of farm households accounting for more than 94% of the total number of farm households in the entire prefecture), except for a few that suffered floods, most of them had a bumper harvest of summer wheat, and autumn grain crops increased by about 20% compared with last year. When summing up this year's production, members of the agricultural cooperatives in many counties realized that the bumper harvest was obtained after being organized and with the strong support of the state, and expressed their willingness to sell more surplus grain to support national construction. In addition to completing the state grain requisition and purchase tasks, agricultural cooperatives in Shouzhang, Fanxian, Qihe and other counties have also sold more than 23 million jin of grain to the state, which is equivalent to about 20% of the surplus grain of each cooperative.

At present, in addition to instructing all grain purchasing stations to continue purchasing, the grain departments in Liaocheng Prefecture have also established purchasing organizations in various free markets to facilitate farmers to sell surplus grain or exchange grain seeds.

    支援灾区人民　支援国家建设
    湖北农民出售增产粮两亿三千多万斤
    山东聊城专区农业社额外多卖余粮
    新华社武汉18日电　湖北省今年粮食增产二十多亿斤，各地农民除了完成公粮和国家统购任务以外，手中还存有相当多的余粮。许多农民回忆起1954年全省遭受水灾，外地送来粮食、种籽等物资支援的情况，纷纷把余粮卖给国家，支援今年遭受严重灾害的河北、江苏等省人民。到9日止的统计，他们卖给国家的增产粮已经达到两亿三千四百多万斤。红安县革命老根据地柳林乡的红坪、红东、安北等三十五个农业社的社员提出“多卖增产粮，让灾区人民吃饱”的口号，仅三天时间，就卖出增产粮二十二万斤。
    新华社聊城18日电　获得粮、棉丰收的山东省聊城专区，许多农业社踊跃多卖余粮，支援国家建设。全专区在11月初完成粮食征、购任务以后，分设在各地的三百九十多个粮食收购站，平均每天仍收购到粮食一百六十多万斤。到12月15日止，全专区征、购粮食的总数已经达到三万零三百四十二万斤，超过原定任务27％以上。在这期间，专区内三百三十多个自由市场的粮食上市量，平均每个集日达到三十四万三千多斤，比过去增加一倍以上。
    今年，聊城专区三千七百多个高级农业社（拥有农户数占全专区农户总数的94％以上）除一部分遭受水灾外，绝大多数在夏季小麦丰收以后，秋季粮食作物又比去年增产两成左右。许多县的农业社在总结今年生产的时候，社员们认识到丰收是组织起来以后在国家大力扶持下获得的，表示要多卖余粮支援国家建设。寿张、范县、齐河等县的农业社除了完成国家粮食征、购任务以外，还向国家出售了相当于各社余粮20％左右的二千三百多万斤粮食。
    现在，聊城专区的粮食部门除了指示各粮食收购站继续收购以外，又在各个自由市场建立收购组织，以便利农民出售余粮或交换粮种。
