Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 30th—Gansu Province has completed 205 kilometers of highways and more than 3,590 kilometers of simple roads this year. Including the original ones, the total length of highways in the province is now more than 12,000 kilometers. Except for Kang County and Wen County, 88 counties and cities in the province are now accessible by automobile.

In recent years, the transportation departments of Gansu Province have focused on building highways in minority areas, remote areas, and emerging industrial and mining areas. Many sheep trails in these areas have now become wide and straight highways, and automobile transportation has replaced donkey transport. The appearance of the areas with highways has also changed accordingly.

　　甘肃省增修公路
    据新华社兰州30日电　甘肃省今年已经修成了二百零五公里公路和三千五百九十多公里简易公路。连原有的在内，现在全省公路总长有一万二千多公里。省内除康县、文县等县以外，有八十八个县、市目前已经全部通行汽车。
    几年来甘肃省交通部门着重在少数民族地区、边远地区和新兴的工矿区兴修公路。这些地区的许多羊肠小道，现在都变成了宽阔笔直的公路，汽车运输代替了毛驴驮运。通行公路的地区的面貌也随着改变了。
