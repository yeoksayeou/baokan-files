    Over 14,000 Agricultural Technology Extension Stations Have Been Established Nationwide; Agricultural Cooperatives Make it Easier to Improve Technology and Increase Production

    (By Our Correspondent) Agricultural technology extension stations, responsible for providing technical guidance to farmers' production, have increased to 14,499 this year, an increase of 6,502 stations compared to the end of last year. More than 76,300 staff are working in these stations. In addition, there are 141 specialized technical extension stations for fruit trees, tea, and sericulture. Except for a few provinces and regions, the requirement of "a station in every district" has been basically achieved.

    These extension stations have made significant achievements in training farmer technicians and helping agricultural cooperatives improve production technology over the past year. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this year alone, agricultural technology extension stations across the country trained more than 6.4 million various types of technicians for agricultural cooperatives. The extension stations also helped farmer technicians establish technical extension committees at the township level, technical research groups in agricultural cooperatives, and a system of agricultural technical extension networks including production team technicians. According to statistics from 72 extension stations in seven counties, including Xinxiang in Henan Province, agricultural cooperatives under their guidance increased wheat production by an average of 15% compared to 1955, cotton production by 18%, and millet production by 12%. According to statistics from 201 extension stations in Shanxi Province, 165 stations, accounting for 80% of the 201 stations, achieved a yield increase of over 20% in the cultivated land under their responsibility, while 28 stations, accounting for 13.9%, achieved a yield increase of less than 20%. The Xijing Township Extension Station in Licheng County saw areas under its guidance averaging 22.1% higher yields of summer and autumn crops than Nanweiquan, a non-guided area. It also created a large-scale high-yield record of 1,154 mu of corn averaging 750 jin per mu (of which 320 mu exceeded 1,000 jin) and 2,861 mu of millet averaging 329 jin per mu. Xingzi County in Jiangxi Province, by adopting the continuous cropping rice cultivation experience that was first successfully tested by the extension station, smoothly achieved early-maturing and high-yielding double-cropping rice on 96,000 mu, with an average increase of 320 jin per mu compared to single-cropping mid-season rice.

    Many technical extension stations have summarized the experience of farmers in various regions in increasing production. From last autumn to June this year, 41 stations in Zhejiang Province summarized more than 2,000 items of experience in increasing production of rice, wheat, cotton, animal husbandry, special products, and aquatic products. The Junyang Extension Station in Gao'an County, Jiangxi Province, has collected 30 items of local agricultural production increase experience through investigation, interviews, and research over the past year.

    One of the difficulties encountered in the current work of technical extension stations is that the leading organs in some areas lack a clear understanding of the nature and tasks of the extension stations, and arbitrarily transfer the staff of the extension stations to do work unrelated to production technology. According to statistics from 12 counties in the Jining area of Shandong Province, 43 extension station staff members were transferred to engage in river management, road construction, general elections, immigration, and the transformation of backward townships. In Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province, the staff of the extension stations in various districts are frequently transferred by the district committees, resulting in many projects among the 240 new and old technology comparison plots established by them this year for agricultural cooperatives not having the time to be summarized.

### 全国已经建立一万四千多个农业技术推广站  农业社更便于改进技术提高产量

    全国已经建立一万四千多个农业技术推广站
    农业社更便于改进技术提高产量
    本报讯　负责对农民生产进行技术指导的农业技术推广站，今年已增加到一万四千四百九十九个，比去年年底增加六千五百零二个站。在这些站里，有七万六千三百多个工作人员在工作着。此外，还有果树、茶叶、蚕桑等专业技术推广站一百四十一个。除少数省、区外，基本上达到“区区有站”的要求。
    这些推广站一年来在训练农民技术员、帮助农业社改进生产技术方面有显著成绩。据不完全统计，仅今年上半年全国农业技术推广站就为农业社训练了各种技术员六百四十多万人。推广站还帮助农民技术员建立了乡的技术推广委员会、农业社的技术研究小组、生产队的技术员等系统的农业技术推广网。据河南省新乡等七个县七十二个推广站的统计，在它们指导下的农业社，平均小麦比1955年增产15％，棉花增产18％，谷子增产12％。据山西省二百零一个推广站的统计，在推广站负责范围内的耕地，增产20％以上的有一百六十五个站，占二百零一个站的80％，增产20％以下的二十八个站，占13.9％。黎城县西井乡推广站指导地区的夏秋作物平均每亩产量比非指导区的南委泉增产22.1％，并创造了一千一百五十四亩玉米平均亩产七百五十斤（其中千斤以上的三百二十亩）、二千八百六十一亩谷子平均亩产三百二十九斤的大面积丰产纪录。江西省星子县由于采用推广站先试验成功的连作稻栽培经验，顺利地使九万六千亩双季稻早熟丰产，平均每亩较一季中稻增产三百二十斤。
    许多技术推广站总结了各地农民的增产经验。浙江省四十一个站从去秋到今年6月，就总结了稻、麦、棉、畜牧、特产、水产等增产经验两千多项。江西省高安县筠阳推广站，一年来通过调查访问和研究，汇集了当地的农业增产经验三十项。
    目前技术推广站开展工作中碰到的困难之一是，有些地区的领导机关对推广站的性质和任务缺乏明确的认识，任意抽调推广站的工作人员去做与生产技术无关的工作。据山东省济宁专区十二个县的统计，有四十三名推广站工作人员被调去搞治河、修路、普选、移民、改造落后乡等工作。辽宁省岫岩县各区推广站的工作人员经常被区委会调动，致使他们今年帮助农业社建立的二百四十个新旧技术对照圃中有许多个项目无暇去作总结。
