　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Port Said: Residents of Port Said are raising national flags and posting increasingly numerous anti-British and anti-French slogans, "seeing off" the British and French aggressor troops who are withdrawing successively.

　　Many portraits of President Nasser are strung together with ropes and hung across the center of the main streets, flying high above the heads of the passing British and French troops. Many slogans are posted on buildings, saying: "Despicable British and French get out," "Get out! Port Said is your grave"…

　　Some buildings have also raised the Egyptian flag and the flag of the Egyptian National Liberation Movement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from Port Said: Three thousand Egyptians held a peaceful demonstration on the afternoon of the 7th, mourning the Egyptian compatriots who were killed by the British and French aggressor troops. The demonstrators marched to the cemetery in the northwestern suburbs of Port Said to pay their respects to the dead.

　　At the same time, anti-British and anti-French occupation slogans appeared on many buildings in Port Said. According to a United Press report, five Egyptians were arrested on the charge of "threatening foreign nationals." According to a report in Cairo's "Al-Ahram," the British and French aggressor troops killed peaceful residents of Port Said, and even children were not spared. Recently, middle and primary school students in Port Said held a march. British troops came to deal with the children and opened fire on them, killing two children.

　　The aggressor troops shot any Egyptian suspected of being a soldier on the spot. They shot an Egyptian policeman named Lutfi Kamish without any reason. He was present to maintain order while residents were lining up to buy kerosene, which is now being sold on ration coupons in Port Said. The British soldiers accused the policeman of organizing a march and shot him in public.

　　Almost all the schools in Port Said have been turned into barracks. The British and French troops are chopping up desks for firewood. The aggressors invaded residents' homes and looted warehouses.

　　The British and French aggressor troops even desecrated Egyptian graves. They began searching for weapons in the cemeteries of Port Said, digging up graves and throwing out the buried remains.

　　The aggressor troops also disrupted the broadcast programs of Egyptian radio stations, preventing residents from hearing Egyptian broadcasts. At the same time, they installed loudspeakers on the main streets of the city, broadcasting anti-Egyptian broadcasts from the British radio station in Cyprus.

    升起埃及国旗　张贴爱国标语
    塞得港居民要英法侵略军赶快撤走
    三千人举行示威哀悼惨遭杀害的同胞
    新华社8日讯　塞得港消息：塞得港居民升起国旗和张贴愈来愈多的反对英法的标语，“欢送”正在陆续撤出的英法侵略军队。
    许多幅纳赛尔总统的肖像用绳子穿起来横挂在大街的中心，它们高高地在路过的英法军队的头上飘动。建筑物上张贴了许多标语口号，这些口号说：“卑鄙的英国人和法国人滚出去”“（英法军队）滚出去！塞得港是你们的坟墓”……
    有些建筑物上还升起了埃及国旗和埃及民族解放运动的旗子。
    新华社8日讯　塞得港消息：三千埃及人在7日下午举行了和平的示威，追悼被英法侵略军杀害的埃及死难同胞。示威者列队到塞得港西北郊墓地向死难者致哀。
    在这同时，塞得港的许多建筑物上出现了反对英法占领者的标语。据合众社消息透露，有五个埃及人被加上“威胁外国侨民”的罪名而逮捕。据开罗的“金字塔报”报道，英法侵略军杀害塞得港的和平居民，甚至儿童也难幸免。最近塞得港的中小学生举行了游行。英国军队赶来对付儿童并且向他们开火，两个孩子被击毙。
    侵略军把每一个被怀疑是士兵的埃及人就地枪杀。他们毫无理由地枪杀了一个叫卢特菲·卡米什的埃及警察，他在居民排队购买现在在塞得港凭证发售的煤油的时候在场维持秩序。英国士兵加给这个警察以组织游行的罪名，便当众枪杀了他。
    塞得港市内几乎所有的学校都变成了兵营。英法军队将书桌劈做木柴。侵略者侵入市内居民住宅并且抢劫了仓库。
    英法侵略军甚至凌辱埃及人的坟墓。他们开始在塞得港市内墓地搜寻武器，掘开坟墓，抛出被埋葬的遗骸。
    侵略军还扰乱埃及无线电台的广播节目，使市内居民听不到埃及的广播。同时他们在市内大街上装置大喇叭，广播在塞浦路斯的英国电台的反埃及广播。
