　　Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: New York dispatch: U.S. Vice President Nixon delivered a speech on foreign policy at the National Automobile Exhibition banquet in New York on the evening of December 6th. In his speech, he spent a great deal of time defending the position the United States had taken on the Middle East issue in the past six weeks and attempted to mend the divisions between Britain, France, and the United States.

　　Nixon pointed out that the United States did not publicly support the armed invasion of Egypt by Britain and France because "if we had supported our friends and allies, Britain and France, in Egypt, they and we would have lost the moral support of the whole world." Nixon stated that he was not unsympathetic to the actions of Britain and France, saying, "Our friends (Britain and France) acted under severe provocation (from Egypt), and they had almost reached the end of their endurance."

　　Nixon believes that because "many people in the world," especially many countries in Asia and Africa, "do not believe" that the United States "has abandoned colonialism," and "our friends in Latin America" have not forgotten "yesterday's gunboat diplomacy," winning the goodwill of neutral countries is an important direction of American policy.

　　Nixon also spoke about the goals of the current U.S. policy in the Middle East. He pointed out that in addition to reopening the canal, it is also necessary to "mobilize the moral, diplomatic, economic, and military strength of the United States and the United Nations" to ensure that the unresolved disputes in the Middle East region are "justly resolved" and to provide "aid" to Middle Eastern countries.

　　Nixon expressed disagreement with the view that the Atlantic alliance has been irreparably broken due to the Middle East events and announced that the United States would provide financial assistance to Britain.

　　In his speech, Nixon also stated that the United States would "not hesitate" to use the Hungarian issue to stir up an anti-Soviet countercurrent around the world. Nixon called for providing "safe havens" for those hostile elements who oppose the people's democratic countries. He also reiterated that the U.S. policy is to provide "assistance and encouragement" to the so-called "peaceful liberation" of the Eastern European people's democratic countries.

　　尼克松透露美国外交新阴谋
　　要骗取中立国家的好感　要向中东使用“援助”的诱饵　要在东欧继续颠覆活动
    据新华8社日讯　纽约消息：美国副总统尼克松12月6日晚上在纽约全国汽车展览会宴会上发表关于外交政策的演说。他在演说里用了很大的篇幅替过去六个星期中美国在中东问题上所采取的立场进行辩护，并且企图弥补英法两国和美国之间的分歧。
    尼克松指出，美国没有公开支持英法对埃及的武装进攻，是因为
  “要是我们在埃及支持了我们的朋友和盟国英法的话，他们和我们就会失去全世界的道义支持。”尼克松表示，他对英法的行动并不是不抱同情的，他说，“我们的朋友（英法）是在（埃及的）严重的挑衅下采取行动的，他们差不多已经到了忍无可忍的地步。”
    尼克松认为，由于“世界上有很多人”，特别是亚非许多国家“不相信”美国“已经放弃了殖民主义”。而“拉丁美洲的朋友”也并没有忘记“昨天的炮舰外交”。因此，争取中立国家的好感是美国政策的一个重要方针。
    尼克松还谈到美国当前在中东的政策的目标。他指出，除了使运河重新开放以外，还必须“把美国和联合国在道义上、外交上、经济上和军事上的力量动员起来”，保证中东地区尚未解决的争端获得“公正的解决”，并且对中东国家进行
  “援助”。
    尼克松表示，不同意由于中东事件，大西洋联盟已经不可补救地垮台了的看法，并宣布美国将给予英国以财政援助。
    尼克松在他的演说里还表示，美国要“毫不犹豫地”利用匈牙利问题在全世界掀起反苏的逆流。尼克松要求为那些反对人民民主国家的敌对分子提供“安全避难所”。他并且重申，美国的政策是：对东欧人民民主国家的所谓“和平解放”给予“援助和鼓励”。
