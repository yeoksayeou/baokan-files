    Construction Updates
    Train Electrical Industry Base
    China's first train electrical industry base is under construction in Baoding City. The main project of the base, the bricklaying of the train equipment factory, has been basically completed. It is expected that this assembly plant will be put into production in the first quarter of next year.
    This base is being built by the Train Electrical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry. In the future, it will use components transported from other brother factories to assemble complete train power generation vehicles to supply temporary industrial electricity along railways throughout the country.

    Eve of Construction of Wuhan Steel's Main Plant Buildings
    Construction of the steel casting workshop of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise has begun. This workshop is the ninth auxiliary repair project of Wuhan Steel to begin construction this year. These projects will all serve Wuhan Steel's production. Earlier projects that started before the steel casting workshop include the metal structure workshop, the mechanical repair workshop, the forging workshop and the electrical repair workshop's four factory buildings, three warehouses, and a place for repairing and parking automobiles. Some are now building walls, and others have already begun installing equipment.
    This year is the last year before the construction of the main production plant buildings of the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise. In the areas where sintering plants, iron smelting plants, refractory material plants, and coking plants are to be built, builders have already removed more than two million cubic meters of loess, opening up wide and flat factory foundations from the hills. Some of the power projects within the factory area have also started construction this year. In Daye Iron Mountain, which serves as the iron ore raw material base, builders are stripping the rock and floating soil of Xing Mountain and Duzi Mountain, and building railways leading to the mine.

    Highway Through the Inner Mongolia Desert
    A highway from Bayanhot to Alxa League in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been completed.
    This highway, which passes through many deserts and wastelands, is 273 kilometers long. In the past, it took herders more than ten days to complete this journey by camel. Now, cars can reach the destination in one and a half days. Alxa League has the famous Jilantai Salt Lake and abundant livestock products. After the highway is completed, the resources here can be transported out continuously.

    Xianghongdian Reservoir Pouring Concrete for Dam
    A new type of dam – the gravity arch dam of Xianghongdian Reservoir – began pouring concrete on the 20th. It is expected to play a flood control role during the flood season next year.
    The gravity arch dam is a relatively popular new type of dam in current global water conservancy projects. The gravity arch dam of Xianghongdian Reservoir is a new type of large dam that has never appeared in China before. Its shape is arc-shaped, with an arc length of 370 meters at the dam top, a chord length of 295 meters, and a maximum dam height of 82 meters. It does not use steel bars and is better than gravity dams, hollow dams, and multiple arch dams in resisting earthquakes and accidental loads. It is the most economical and ideal type of dam in cases where the river valley is narrow and the geology is good.
    Xianghongdian Reservoir is located in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province. It is one of the important large-scale projects in the Dabie Mountain reservoir group. It controls a basin area of 1,350 square kilometers above the dam site on the western source of the Pi River, with a maximum flood storage capacity of more than 2.34 billion cubic meters.

    列车电业基地
    我国第一个列车电业基地正在保定市兴建。基地的主要工程——列车装备厂的砌砖工程，已经基本完成；预计在明年第一季度这座装配厂即开始投入生产。
    这个基地是电力工业部列车电业局兴建的。将来这里将用其它兄弟工厂运来的部件，装配完整的列车发电车辆，以供应全国各铁路沿线上的工业临时用电。（新华社）
    武钢主厂房施工前夜
    武汉钢铁联合企业的铸钢车间已动工兴建。这个车间是武钢辅助修理工程中今年动工的第九项。这些工程都将为武钢生产服务。比铸钢车间先开工的有金属结构车间，机械修理车间、锻造车间和电修车间的四个厂房、三个仓库和一个修理、停放汽车的场所。现在它们有的正在砌墙，有的已经开始安装设备。
    今年是武汉钢铁联合企业主要生产厂房施工前的最后一年。在将要兴建烧结厂、炼铁厂、耐火材料厂和焦化厂的地方，建筑者们已经铲削了两百多万立方公尺的黄土，从丘陵中开拓出宽阔平坦的厂基。厂区内的部分动力工程，今年也陆续动工了。在作为铁矿原料基地的大冶铁山，建筑者们正在剥离兴山，独子山的岩石，浮土，修筑通往矿山的铁路。　（新华社）
    通过内蒙古沙漠的公路
    内蒙古自治区由巴彦浩特通往阿拉善旗的一条公路已经修成。
    这条通过许多处沙漠和荒滩的公路，全长有二百七十三公里。过去，牧民们骑骆驼要十多天才能走完这段路程，现在汽车一天半可以到达。阿拉善旗有著名的吉兰泰盐池和丰饶的畜产品。公路修通后，这里的资源就可以源源外运。

    响洪甸水库浇筑拦河坝
    一座新型的拦河坝——响洪甸水库的重力拱坝，20日开始浇筑混凝土，预计明年汛期，就可以发挥拦洪作用。
    重力拱坝是目前世界水利工程中比较流行的一种新坝型。响洪甸水库的重力拱坝是中国过去未曾出现过的新型大坝，它的外形呈圆弧形，坝顶弧长三百七十公尺，弦长二百九十五公尺，最大坝高八十二公尺。它不用钢筋，而且在抵抗地震及意外荷重方面，比重力坝、空心坝、连拱坝等坝型都好。在河谷狭窄、地质良好的情况下，它是最经济、最理想的一种坝型。
    响洪甸水库在安徽省金寨县境内，是大别山水库群中重要的大型工程之一，它控制淠河西源坝址以上流域面积一千三百五十平方公里，最大蓄洪量二十三亿四千多万公方。　（新华社）
