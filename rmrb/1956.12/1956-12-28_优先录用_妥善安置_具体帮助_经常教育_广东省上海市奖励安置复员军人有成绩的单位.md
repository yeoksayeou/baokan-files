Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 25th: The Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou Municipal People's Committees jointly held a conference on the 22nd to commend and reward eight units and six individuals who properly安置settled demobilized soldiers.

The Guangzhou People's Broadcasting Station, which received commendation and awards, employed a total of thirty demobilized soldiers with basic radio knowledge and work experience from January to September this year. Based on the needs of the business, the station's leaders combined the principle of "learning and application are consistent" with personal aspirations, assigning twenty-eight people to radio work. They also designated special personnel to guide them and organized them to participate in radio business studies. The Party and League organizations also enthusiastically helped demobilized soldiers formulate personal plans to advance towards science and designated special personnel to conduct political and ideological education. The Guangzhou Municipal First Commercial Bureau has been able to prioritize the employment of demobilized soldiers when it needs to increase its staff. By mid-September, the First Commercial Bureau had安置settled a total of seventy-two demobilized soldiers. When demobilized soldiers took office, the bureau's leaders introduced them to the work situation and properly安置settled them according to their specialties and the work they had done in the army. Because the First Commercial Bureau安置settled demobilized soldiers properly and attached importance to the education of demobilized soldiers, most of the three hundred and forty-six demobilized soldiers in the bureau worked actively and performed well. One hundred of them were rated as advanced workers in the second quarter of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee awarded a certificate to the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory on the 21st to commend the achievements made by the factory in the work of安置settling demobilized soldiers.

The No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory took the initiative to absorb twenty-seven demobilized soldiers this year, which is more than the total number absorbed in previous years. Most of these demobilized soldiers were assigned to technical positions and were given guidance by special personnel. The factory leaders discovered that demobilized soldier Chen Dafu had studied electroplating before joining the army, so they transferred him from the cloth washing workshop to learn steel and chrome plating. Later, they found that Chen Dafu often went to the printing workshop to look at the color samples of the cloth and had a better foundation and interest in painting, so they transferred him to learn zinc plate engraving. Now, after four and a half months of study, Chen Dafu has reached the technical level of an eighth-grade worker, which usually takes one and a half to two years to reach. In the second half of this year, the factory's personnel department also accepted the requests of demobilized soldiers and transferred eight people who were interested in printing and dyeing technology to study printing and engraving.

Since this year, the No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory has listed the regular holding of forums for demobilized soldiers in the factory as one of the important factory-wide meetings. Such meetings have been held four times. At the meetings, the opinions of demobilized soldiers on all aspects of life and work are listened to, so that the leadership can correct the phenomenon of low wages for fifteen demobilized soldiers in a timely manner.

The Party and League organizations of the No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory also attach great importance to conducting political and ideological education for demobilized soldiers. The person in charge of the Party branch and the League branch of the factory's construction workshop has conducted revolutionary soldier honor education on demobilized soldier Shen Zhenxiang several times, overcoming his pride due to some achievements in his work. Now, Shen Zhenxiang has become an advanced producer. Demobilized soldier Jiang Jiacai was not good at handling family relations. Sometimes, he would quarrel with his wife over housework and beat her. Fan Xiayou, a member of the Party branch committee, visited his home more than thirty times and patiently educated him, finally changing Jiang Jiacai's mistaken thinking of discriminating against women and harmonizing the couple who were almost divorced.

Up to now, most of the demobilized soldiers in the factory have become active members in production and work. Twelve people have been rated as advanced producers, nine have been trained to become technicians of grade six or above, and five have joined the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League.

    广东省上海市奖励安置复员军人有成绩的单位
    新华社广州25日电　广东省和广州市人民委员会在22日联合举行大会，表扬和奖励了妥善安置复员军人的八个单位和六个人。
    受到表扬和奖励的广州人民广播电台，从今年1月到9月共录用了三十名具有无线电基本知识和工作经验的复员军人。电台的领导人员根据业务的需要，结合了“学用一致”的原则和个人志愿，分配二十八人做无线电工作，并且指定专人辅导他们，组织他们参加无线电业务学习。党、团组织也热情地帮助复员军人制定个人向科学进军的规划，并且指定专人进行政治思想教育。广州市第一商业局在需要增加职工的时候，都能够优先录用复员军人。到9月中旬止，第一商业局共安置了七十二名复员军人。在复员军人到职的时候，局的领导人员向他们介绍工作情况，并且根据复员军人的特长和他们在部队所做的工作，给以妥善安置。由于第一商业局对复员军人安置恰当，并且重视对复员军人的教育，在局的三百四十六名复员军人中，大部分都积极工作，表现良好，本年度第二季被评为先进工作者的就有一百人。
    据新华社上海讯　上海市人民委员会21日授予国营上海第一印染厂一份奖状，表彰这个厂在安置复员军人的工作中所做出的成绩。
    国印一厂在今年主动吸收了二十七名复员军人，这数字比以往几年吸收的总人数还多。这些复员军人大部分被分配在技术岗位上，并有专人给予指导。厂的领导上发现复员军人陈达夫参军前学过电镀，就把他从洗布车间调出来去学习镀钢镀铬的工作，后来又发现陈达夫经常到印花车间看布色样，对绘画更有基础和兴趣，就调他学习锌版雕刻。现在，陈达夫经过四个半月的学习，已达到了一般人需一年半到两年才能达到的八级工的技术水平。今年下半年以后，厂的人事部门还接受复员军人的要求，调了八个对印染技术有兴趣的人去学习印花、雕刻。
    国印一厂从今年开始，把定期举行全厂复员军人座谈会列为全厂性重要会议之一。这种会议已经举行过四次，会上听取复员军人对生活、工作各方面的意见，使领导方面及时纠正了十五个复员军人工资偏低的现象。
    国印一厂党和团的组织还很重视对复员军人进行政治思想教育工作。这个厂的修建车间党支部和团支部的负责人，曾经几次对复员军人沈桢祥进行革命军人荣誉教育，克服了他因工作有一些成绩而骄傲的情绪，现在，沈桢祥已经成为一个先进生产者了。复员军人姜家才不善于处理家庭关系，有时候因家务事争吵起来就打骂妻子，党支部委员范霞友到他家里访问了三十多次，向他耐心地进行教育，终于转变了姜家才歧视妇女的错误思想，使这对几乎要离婚的夫妻和睦了。
    到目前为止，全厂大部分复员军人已经成为生产上和工作中的积极分子，十二个人被评为先进生产者，九个人已经培养成为六级以上的技工，五个人参加了中国共产党和青年团。
