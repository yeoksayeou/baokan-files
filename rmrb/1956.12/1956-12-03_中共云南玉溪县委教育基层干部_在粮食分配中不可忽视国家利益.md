    CCP Yuxi County Committee Education Cadres at the Grassroots Level: National Interests Cannot Be Ignored in Grain Distribution
    Kunming Dispatch: In grain distribution work, some agricultural production cooperatives in Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, ignored the principle that the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the members must be taken into account simultaneously, and adopted the incorrect approach of "collective first, members second, and the state last." Some grassroots cadres and rural work cadres, when they discovered that the actual income of agricultural cooperatives did not reach the originally planned labor remuneration, distributed part of the public grain and surplus grain that should have been sold to the members. For example, in Zhengjing Township, the original plan was one yuan and three jiao per labor day, but now only six jiao and eight fen are distributed per labor day. Li Fake, the secretary of the township Party branch, ordered the cooperative director to take out public grain for distribution. In order to increase the labor remuneration of seven jiao and eight fen to eight jiao, the Xiajing Agricultural Cooperative also distributed part of the public grain. In order to pay less public grain, the Wayao Agricultural Cooperative reported more than 300 mu of land as disaster-stricken and reduced production. The result of such incorrect distribution is: on the one hand, many members' families have too much surplus grain, and on the other hand, the grain purchase tasks of the agricultural cooperatives cannot be completed as required.
    The CCP Yuxi County Committee did not begin to arrange this work until November 18. Due to the late issuance of purchase tasks, cadres in many townships felt passive in their work. Recently, the CCP Yuxi County Committee held a meeting to study grain work. The county committee believes that in order to do a good job in grain purchase, it is first necessary to improve the thinking of cadres so that they correctly recognize that the interests of the state, the collective interests of the cooperative, and the individual interests of the members must be taken into account simultaneously. It is absolutely wrong to only consider the interests of the cooperative and the members, while harming the interests of the state; then educate the peasants to return the grain that should not have been distributed and was distributed in excess. Now, the Yuxi County Committee is helping the district committees to convene meetings of township CCP branch secretaries, agricultural cooperative directors, and other cadres to educate grassroots cadres.

### 中共云南玉溪县委教育基层干部　在粮食分配中不可忽视国家利益

    中共云南玉溪县委教育基层干部
　　在粮食分配中不可忽视国家利益
    本报昆明电　云南省玉溪县部分农业生产合作社在粮食分配工作中，忽视国家、合作社和社员三者利益必须兼顾的原则，采取了“先集体、后社员、再国家”的错误做法。部分基层干部和农村工作干部，发现农业社的实际收入达不到原来规划的劳动日报酬的时候，就把一部分公粮和该卖出的余粮分给了社员。如郑井乡原规划每个劳动日是一元三角，现在每个劳动日只分得六角八分，乡党支部书记李发科便叫社主任把公粮拿去分配。下井农业社为了把七角八分的劳动报酬提高到八角，也把一部分公粮分掉了。瓦窑农业社为了少交点公粮，多报了三百多亩受灾减产田。这样错误地分配的结果是：一方面许多社员家中的余粮过多，另一方面，农业社的粮食征购任务却不能如数完成。
    中共玉溪县委到11月18日才开始布置这一工作。由于征购任务下达的晚，许多乡的干部感到工作被动。最近，中共玉溪县委开会研究了粮食工作。县委认为：要搞好粮食征购工作首先必须提高干部的思想，使他们正确地认识到国家利益、合作社的集体利益、社员个人利益三者必须兼顾，决不应该只顾合作社和社员的利益，而损害国家的利益；然后再教育农民把不应分而多分了的粮食退出来。现在，玉溪县委正帮助各区委召开乡中共支部书记、农业社主任等干部会议，向基层干部进行教育。　（李裕如）
