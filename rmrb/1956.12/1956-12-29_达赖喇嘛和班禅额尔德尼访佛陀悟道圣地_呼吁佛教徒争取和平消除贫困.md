Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 28th: The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni addressed approximately 10,000 people attending a welcoming ceremony held for them in Bodh Gaya, Bihar State, the sacred site of Buddha's enlightenment, on the 27th.

The Dalai Lama said: "The crisis facing the world today can only be stopped if we adhere to the principle of non-violence. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence adopt this principle, and it will undoubtedly be a solution to the problems of this turbulent world. Therefore, Buddhists must abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, remember the great wisdom of our Buddha to do good and abandon evil, and strive for world peace." He urged Buddhists to follow the path by which the Buddha himself attained enlightenment, and to always remember the suffering of all sentient beings in their hearts.

The Dalai Lama praised India for showing great respect to Buddhists after gaining independence, under the guidance of Gandhi, Nehru, and other outstanding leaders. He also thanked the people of Gaya for their hospitality. He said, "Please believe that I will often think of your health and happiness."

In his speech, the Panchen praised the progress made by India. He preached about the Buddha's enlightenment and the Buddha's teachings. He said: "Today, when there is fear of war and destructive weapons, we must cultivate love for others, as the Buddha taught." He called on all Buddhists to follow the Buddha and strive to eliminate poverty, disease, and ignorance among the people. He prayed for the eternal friendship between China and India.

Soshini, the Commissioner of the Patna Administrative Region of Bihar State and Chairman of the welcoming committee, said that the visit of the two distinguished guests was a very important event for the residents of Gaya. He said that people regard the Dalai Lama and the Panchen as dedicated to world peace and human welfare. He hoped that the visit of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen would consolidate the relations and common spirit between the two countries and would be conducive to peace.

Menon, the administrative head of Gaya County, Prasad, the Secretary-General of the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee, and two boys representing the Gaya branch of the All India Children's Organization, and others, delivered warm welcoming speeches and presented gifts to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen. The Dalai Lama presented a set of 100 volumes of Tibetan books to the Bodh Gaya Temple Management Committee.

The welcoming ceremony was held in the square near the Bodh Gaya Temple. Attending the welcoming ceremony were monks, Buddhists, and villagers from all parts of Bihar, Sikkim, Bhutan, and Tibet, China. The welcoming ceremony began with beautiful music and welcoming songs. Two girls presented garlands to the two distinguished guests.

Before attending the welcoming ceremony, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen, and their entourage visited the magnificent Bodh Gaya Temple, which is 160 feet high. They offered prayers in the temple and worshiped under the Bodhi tree. The current temple was rebuilt in the eleventh century. Xuanzang's records once described its magnificent appearance in the past. Today, the temple is newly decorated, and in the evening, it stands brilliantly lit under the dark blue sky.

The Dalai Lama and the Panchen arrived here on the afternoon of the 27th from Lumbini. They will visit and offer prayers here for three days.

    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼访佛陀悟道圣地
    呼吁佛教徒争取和平消除贫困
    新华社新德里28日电　达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼27日在佛陀悟道的圣地、比哈尔邦的菩提伽耶向出席为他们举行的欢迎会的约一万人讲了话。
    达赖说：“今日世界所面临的危机只有我们坚持非暴力原则才能得到制止。五项原则采用了这项原则，它无疑将是一项解决这个动乱世界的问题的办法。因此，佛教徒们一定要遵守五项原则，而且要遵守为善弃恶、把我们佛陀的大智大慧铭记于心，来努力争取世界和平。”他吁请佛教徒循着佛陀本人得以悟道的道路前进，并且心中要始终不忘众生的痛苦。
    达赖赞扬印度在获得独立后，在甘地、尼赫鲁和其他杰出领袖们的指导下对佛教徒所表现出的很大的尊重。他并且感谢伽耶人民对他们的殷勤款待。他说：“请相信，我将经常想到你们的健康和幸福。”
    班禅在讲话中赞扬了印度所取得的进步。他宣讲了佛陀悟道的经过和佛陀的教义。他说：“今天当存在着战争恐惧和毁灭性武器的时候，我们必须如佛陀所教导的那样，要培养对别人的爱。”他吁请所有佛教徒要追随佛陀，努力来消除人民的贫困、疾病和无知状态。他祝祷印中两国友谊永恒不朽。
    比哈尔邦巴特那行政区专员、欢迎会主席索希尼说，两位贵宾到这里来访问是伽耶居民的一件非常重大的事情。他说，人们把达赖和班禅看做是献身于世界和平及人类福利的人。他希望达赖和班禅的访问将会巩固两国之间的关系及共同的精神，并将有利于和平。
    伽耶县行政长官梅农、菩提伽耶寺管理委员会秘书长普拉萨德以及代表印度全国儿童组织伽耶分会的两个男孩子和其他一些人都发表了热烈的欢迎词，并且向达赖和班禅赠送了礼物。达赖把一部共有一百卷的藏文书籍送给菩提伽耶寺管理委员会。
    欢迎会是在菩提伽耶寺附近的广场上举行的。参加欢迎会的有来自比哈尔各地和锡金、不丹以及中国西藏的僧侣、佛教徒和村民。欢迎会以美妙悦耳的音乐和表示欢迎的歌曲开始。两个女孩子向这两位贵宾献了花环。
    在参加欢迎会之前，达赖、班禅和他们的随行人员参观了这座壮丽的、高达一百六十英尺的菩提伽耶寺。他们在寺内作了祝祷，并且在大菩提树下作了礼拜。目前的这座寺院是在十一世纪重建的。玄奘的记载中曾经描写过它过去的壮丽的面貌。今天，这座寺院装饰一新，晚间，它灯火辉煌地矗立在暗蓝的天空下。
    达赖和班禅是在27日下午从蓝毗尼到达这里的。他们将在这里访问和祝祷三天。
