　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd. "Neues Deutschland" reports that metallurgical industrialists in Schleswig-Holstein, West Germany, are striving to use Hungarian refugees to undermine a strike that has lasted for five weeks. Big capitalists in the Ruhr and big landlords in West Germany are also attempting to hire Hungarian refugees at the lowest wages.
　　The West German Social Democratic Party's "Neue Rhein Zeitung" reported on the activity of hunting for cheap labor in the Bohrholt refugee camp, saying: "In the first three days after the Hungarians arrived, labor recruiters in the refugee camp were simply swarming. Employers and landlords from far and wide lured refugees with all kinds of promises and money. Many Hungarians were taken away on their future employers' trucks like livestock going to the slaughterhouse, and some of them later returned. After all, two marks a day and a little food were too little for them."
　　At the same time, reactionary propaganda in West Germany is doing everything possible to prevent Hungarian refugees from returning to their homeland, frightening them with the claim that they will be persecuted if they return.
　　According to British press reports, British authorities are also using Hungarian refugees to undertake the most arduous industrial labor. Employment agencies under the jurisdiction of the British Ministry of Labor are sending Hungarians to work in the mines. The "Star" reported that a group of Hungarian refugees were assigned to work in the mines of the Midlands, where many "displaced persons" who had migrated to Britain after the war were already working.
　　In addition, some textile factory owners in Lancashire also intend to employ Hungarian refugees. The working conditions there are particularly bad.

　　匈牙利难民在英国和西德被迫当牛马
　  资本家和地主用最低工资雇用他们做苦工
    新华社柏林3日电　“新德意志报”报道说，西德石勒苏益格—荷尔斯泰因的冶金工业企业主竭力利用匈牙利难民来破坏已经坚持了五个星期的罢工。鲁尔的大资本家和西德的大地主也企图以最低的工资雇用匈牙利难民。
    西德社会民主党的“新莱因报”报道波荷尔特难民营中这种猎取廉价劳动力的活动说：“在匈牙利人到达的最初三天内，难民营中的招工代理人简直川流不息。从远近各地来的雇主和地主们用种种诺言和金钱引诱难民。许多匈牙利人就像上屠场的牲畜一样上了他们未来雇主的卡车走了，其中有些人后来又回来了。每天两马克的工资和一点点粮食对他们毕竟是太少了。”
    同时，西德的反动宣传还千方百计地阻挠匈牙利难民返回祖国，吓唬他们说，回国将会遭受迫害。
    据英国报刊报道，英国当局也利用匈牙利难民来担负最繁重的工业劳动。英国劳工部管辖的职业介绍所把匈牙利人送到矿坑中工作。“明星报”报道说，有一批匈牙利难民被分配到密德兰的矿井中，这地方已有许多战后迁移到英国的“流落者”在工作。
    此外，兰开夏的一些纺织厂主也打算雇用匈牙利难民工作。那里的劳动条件特别坏。
