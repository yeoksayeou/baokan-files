    The New Garb of the American "Strength" Policy
    Ji Long
    Since mid-November this year, American news agencies and newspapers have been spreading rumors about a major change in American foreign policy. Subsequently, official propaganda began. On December 6, Nixon, in his speech at the National Automobile Exhibition banquet, emphatically boasted about the "change" in American foreign policy. He said it was a "historical turning point" and that "America had withstood the test of history." He also exaggerated that this "change" had "high drama."
    Nixon said: "We have now abandoned colonialism and pledged to support countries that were formerly ruled as colonies by great powers." This is the theme in the current American propaganda of the foreign policy "change." Since Nixon said that America "has abandoned" colonialism, it is clear that America no longer conceals that it has been pursuing a colonialist foreign policy in the past. Now, without dwelling on the past, the first question is whether the United States is taking practical actions to change its past policies. For example, regarding Portugal's colonial rule in Goa, is the United States now retracting the position expressed in the joint statement issued last December by Dulles and the Portuguese Foreign Minister, and positively supporting the Indian people in reclaiming Goa? Does the United States now support Indonesia's legitimate demand to reclaim West Irian? Regarding the Cyprus issue and the Algerian issue, is the United States now taking a clear anti-colonialist stance? The people of Okinawa oppose the American military rule and demand restoration to Japan; is the United States now respecting their wishes? These are all real and concrete issues. In every such concrete issue, there is a struggle between colonialism and anti-colonialism, and it will not work for the American authorities to talk emptily about "abandoning" colonialism. People demand that the United States show it with action.
    So far, the United States can only cite one thing to adorn its image, that is, the United States conformed to the opinion of the majority of countries in the United Nations and demanded that Britain, France, and Israel cease fire and withdraw troops in the Egypt incident. But the United States did so not out of support for the just position of the Egyptian people, but in an attempt to squeeze out Britain and France in order to replace them. United Press reporter Hansley pointed out in a report: "The United States has made it clear to Britain and France that it intends to try to fill the vacuum of power that has been lost in strength and prestige due to the unfortunate Suez adventure in Paris and London." Therefore, while the United States voted in the United Nations to demand that Britain, France, and Israel cease fire and withdraw troops, it also openly defended the aggressive acts of Britain, France, and Israel. In that speech on December 6, Nixon said: "Our friends (referring to Britain and France) took action under severe provocation, and they were almost at the end of their tether." He even said that in the Egypt incident, Britain and France "faced a series of aggressive acts except for the use of force." According to Nixon, Britain and France took action because they were "provoked" and "aggressed" by Egypt and "couldn't bear it any longer," that is to say, Britain and France, who pursued colonialist policies and launched wars of aggression, were right, and their behavior was justified, while Egypt's just act of exercising national sovereignty and safeguarding national independence was "provocation" and "aggression." How can American dignitaries who hold such views claim that they have abandoned colonialism?
    The American ruling clique thought that as long as they used Britain and France as scapegoats and shifted the target, the United States could be clean and hang a new sign of "anti-colonialism." American bourgeois commentator Lippmann pointed out in the "Washington Post" on December 4 that this would not work. He said: "To believe this is to forget half the world, to forget the Far East and the Pacific region where the United States is everywhere. The United States is present in Japan, Korea, Okinawa, the Taiwan Strait, South Vietnam, and the trust islands—the so-called trust territories." Here, Lippmann deliberately did not mention the American colonial expansion in the Middle East, Latin America, and other parts of the world, but judging only from the facts he cited, no matter how the United States publicizes, it will never be able to convince people that it has "abandoned colonialism." Therefore, even Lippmann admitted that if one pretends to forget all this, "that is seriously deceiving oneself." For the Asian and African people and the people in other parts of the world who are resolutely fighting against colonialism, this kind of deception is obviously very clumsy.
    The American ruling group also interprets the final differences between the United States and Britain and France in the Egypt incident as a difference in principle between peace and war, emphasizing that the United States advocates peace and "moral pressure" and opposes "deliberately using war as an instrument of national policy." Naturally, if the United States truly advocates peace and opposes war, it is welcome. However, what Dulles, who represented the American government at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council on December 11 to deliver a "philosophical background speech," truly emphasized was not peace. He said, "Moral pressure" is needed, but that is only as a means of "maintaining military strength and determination," and the United States' foreign policy mainly relies on "military force," specifically, "atomic retaliatory power." According to the USIS, Dulles "believed that the most important thing is to maintain the strength of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and at the same time, there should be no doubt that the free world should use this force when necessary." In this speech, he mentioned "determination" more than once, not the determination for peace but the determination to maintain military strength and use military strength. This kind of "determination" cannot but immediately remind people of Dulles' "art of brinkmanship." It is very obvious that the American foreign policy explained by Dulles on December 11 is still the "strength" policy and war policy that are opposed by the Asian and African people and the people of the world. Agence France-Presse reported from Washington on December 15 on the views of some American commentators. These commentators sharply pointed out: "The moral strength advocated by Dulles is just another form of propaganda," "a foreign policy that relies solely on military power and propaganda is very likely to lead to war." It is this policy that constitutes the North Atlantic Group, the Southeast Asia Treaty Group, and the Baghdad Treaty Group, which create tension and discord; it is this policy that makes the people of all countries suffer from heavy military burdens, and foreign economic and trade activities are subject to "embargo" restrictions, and the health of the people in vast areas is threatened by American hydrogen bomb tests. This American "strength" policy, no matter how charmingly dressed, cannot but be opposed by peace-loving people of all countries.
    The United States also often mentions using economic "aid" to win over Asian and African countries. Nixon called this "aid" "generous aid" in his December 6 speech. In fact, everyone knows that US "aid" is conditional and not "generous." Only since the second half of last year, after socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, provided selfless assistance to some Asian countries and developed equal and mutually beneficial economic relations, have the conditions for US "aid" been forced to gradually relax. Eisenhower specially emphasized the necessity of this relaxation in his "special message" on foreign aid in March this year. Nixon also admitted in his speech that providing this "generous aid" was because "some people are happy to accept the tempting songs issued by Moscow."
    Has US "aid" really become so "generous"? Egypt's experience can illustrate this. For example, last December, the US government announced that it was prepared to fund the first phase of the Aswan Dam construction project in Egypt with 55 million US dollars (Britain simultaneously announced funding of 15 million US dollars). This funding itself had no conditions, but the funds and the 200 million US dollars that the World Bank planned to lend to Egypt at the same time should be regarded as a whole, and the World Bank's loans were subject to the condition of supervising Egypt's finances. President Nasser said when he met with a reporter from the Italian newspaper "Times" on December 10 this year: "They linked the issue of helping with the construction of the Aswan Dam with some conditions that could turn Egypt into a colony." So-called "generosity" is like this. In fact, some conditions are not necessarily formally proposed or clearly stipulated. For example, the United States often considers US "aid" from a political perspective and controls it. Hollister, director of the US International Cooperation Administration, publicly stated at a press conference that the figures for "aid" planned for various countries cannot be announced because "given the changing situation in the world, the International Cooperation Administration must maintain great flexibility, increasing or decreasing the plans for various countries in order to most effectively implement the entire plan." The US government's sudden announcement on July 19 this year to withdraw its proposal to "aid" the construction of the Aswan Dam is an example of this kind of "flexibility."
    According to a report from Washington by United Press reporter Hansley on December 12, American officials recently stated that they are reconsidering helping to build the Aswan Dam, but it depends on Nasser's attitude in the next few weeks. Obviously, the United States still intends to continue to make a fuss about the issue of "aid" to the Aswan Dam construction project. However, through the United States' capriciousness on this specific "aid" issue, people have more clearly seen the political intentions of US "aid." Many Asian and African countries are particularly wary of US "aid," and there is good reason for this. President Sukarno once frankly told the Americans the basic attitude of the Asian and African people towards this US "aid" that is self-proclaimed "generous." He said: "Of course, we want to accept aid, ... but we would rather work barehanded on our land and in the jungle than exchange any part of our freedom for any kind of aid."
    What the Asian and African people and the people in other parts of the world demand is freedom, independence, progress, and peace. For these, the Asian and African people and all other peace-loving people are willing to cooperate with everyone and are always ready to fight against all enemies. As for who is a friend and who is an enemy, the people of all countries have learned in practice to judge from the actual actions of each person. The executors of the "strength" policy are currently promoting the "change" in American policy in this way, actually just hanging the signboard of anti-colonialism, raising the banner of peace, and putting on the cloak of "generous aid" to find loopholes in Asian and African countries, divide and weaken the world's peace and democratic forces, restore the "cold war," create tension, and carry out imperialist expansion in Asian and African regions and other regions with a hypocritical face. However, any clever disguise cannot save the inevitable failure of the American "strength" policy; the Asian and African people and the people of all peace-loving countries will not relax their struggle against colonialism and for peace and progress because of American deception.

    美国“实力”政策的新装
    纪隆
    从今年11月中旬起，美国的通讯社和报纸刊物纷纷传说美国外交政策有了重大的改变。接着，就开始了官方的宣传。12月6日，尼克松在全国汽车展览会宴会上的演说里，曾经着重地夸耀美国外交政策的“改变”。他说，这是“历史的转折点”，“美国经受了历史的考验”。他并且渲染这个“改变”具有“高度戏剧性”。
    尼克松说：“现在我们已经放弃了殖民主义，并且保证支持以前被大国当作殖民地统治的国家”。这是目前美国所宣传的外交政策“改变”中的主题。尼克松既然说美国“已经放弃”了殖民主义，显然美国也不再隐讳它过去所执行的是殖民主义的外交政策。现在，暂且不咎既往，问题首先是，美国是否用实际的行动来改变过去的政策呢？例如，对于葡萄牙在果阿的殖民统治，美国是否现在撤销杜勒斯和葡萄牙外交部长在去年12月发表的联合声明所表示的立场，正面支持印度人民收回果阿？美国现在是否支持印度尼西亚收回西伊里安的正当的要求？对于塞浦路斯问题，对于阿尔及利亚问题，美国现在是否采取明确的反殖民主义立场？冲绳岛人民反对美国的军事统治，要求恢复归属日本；美国现在是否要尊重他们的愿望？这些都是现实存在的具体问题。在每一个这样的具体问题中都存在着殖民主义与反殖民主义的斗争，美国当局空谈“放弃”殖民主义是混不过去的。人们要求美国用行动来表明。
    到现在为止，美国只能举出一件事装饰门面，那就是，美国在联合国顺从了大多数国家的意见，在埃及事件上要求英、法、以色列停火撤兵。但是美国这样做并不是出于对埃及人民正义立场的支持，而是企图借此排挤英法，以便取代它们的地位。合众社记者汉斯莱在报道中就曾指出：“美国已经向英国和法国表明，它打算把由于巴黎与伦敦进行不幸的苏伊士冒险而丧失力量和威信以后所留下的势力范围的真空地带设法补充起来。”因此，美国一面在联合国投票要求英、法、以停火撤兵，一面又公开地为英、法、以的侵略行为辩护。在12月6日那篇演说里，尼克松就曾说：“我们的朋友（指英国和法国）是在严重的挑衅下采取行动的，他们差不多已经到了忍无可忍的地步”。他甚至说，在埃及事件中，英法“面临着除了还没有使用武力以外的一系列侵略行为”。按照尼克松的说法，英、法是在遭受埃及的“挑衅”和“侵略”之下，“忍无可忍”而采取行动的，也就是说，执行殖民主义政策、发动侵略战争的英法是对的，它们的行为是正当的，而埃及的行使国家主权、维护国家独立的正义行为却是“挑衅”和“侵略”。难道抱着这样的见解的美国当权人物能够宣称自己已经放弃了殖民主义吗？
    美国统治集团以为只要拿英、法做替罪的羔羊，转移目标，美国就可以一身干净，挂上“反殖民主义”的新招牌。美国资产阶级政论家李普曼12月4日在“华盛顿邮报”上就已经指出，这样做是行不通的。他说：“相信这一点就是忘掉半个世界、忘掉远东和太平洋这个地区到处都有美国的存在。在日本、朝鲜、冲绳岛、台湾海峡、南越和托管岛屿——即所谓托管领土——都有美国的存在。”在这里，李普曼故意没有提美国在中东、拉丁美洲以及世界其他各处的殖民扩张，但是就仅仅以他所举出的事实来说，美国无论怎样宣传，也绝对无法使人相信它已“放弃了殖民主义”。因此，连李普曼也承认，如果装作忘记这一切，“那就是严重地欺骗自己”。对于坚决为反对殖民主义而斗争的亚非人民和世界其他各处的人民来说，这种欺骗手段显然是十分拙劣的。
    美国统治集团还把美国在埃及事件中最后与英法的分歧解释为和平与战争的原则上的分歧，强调美国主张和平和“道义上的压力”，反对“有意用战争作为国家政策的工具”。自然，如果美国真正主张和平，反对战争，那是值得欢迎的。但是，12月11日代表美国政府在北大西洋公约组织理事会上发表“哲学性的背景讲话”的杜勒斯所真正强调的并不是和平。他说，
  “道义上的压力”是需要的，但那只不过是作为“保持军事实力和决心”的手段，美国的对外政策主要地仍然依靠“军事力量”，具体地说，就是“原子报复力量”。据美新处报道，杜勒斯“认为最重要的是，必须维持北大西洋公约组织的力量，同时应当对于自由世界在必要的时候使用这种力量这一点毫不怀疑”。他在这篇演说里，不只一次提到“决心”，不是和平的决心而是保持军事实力和使用军事实力的决心。这种“决心”不禁使人立即联想到杜勒斯的“战争边缘的艺术”。很明显，杜勒斯12月11日所说明的美国外交政策，仍然是那个遭到亚非人民和全世界人民反对的“实力”政策、战争政策。法新社12月15日从华盛顿报道了美国某些评论家的看法。这些评论家尖锐地指出：“杜勒斯所鼓吹的道义力量只不过是另一种形式的宣传而已”，“一种单纯依靠军事威力和宣传的外交政策是极其可能导向战争的”。正是这种政策组成了制造紧张不和的北大西洋集团、东南亚条约集团和巴格达条约集团；正是这种政策使各国人民苦于沉重的军费负担，对外经济贸易活动受着“禁运”的限制，广大地区人民的健康受着美国氢弹试验的威胁。美国的这种“实力”政策，不管穿上怎样迷人的新装，都不能不受到各国爱好和平人民的反对。
    美国还常常提起用经济“援助”来争取亚非国家。尼克松在他的12月6日的演说中把这种“援助”称为“慷慨的援助”。其实，人人都知道，美“援”是附条件的，并不“慷慨”。只是从去年下半年起，社会主义国家，特别是苏联，向亚洲某些国家提供无私援助并且展开平等互利的经济关系以后，美“援”的条件才被迫逐渐放松。艾森豪威尔在今年3月的援外“特别咨文”里曾经特别强调这种放松的必要。尼克松在演说中也承认，提供这种“慷慨的援助”是因为“有些人乐于接受莫斯科所发出的诱惑人的歌声”。
    是不是美“援”真的变得那么“慷慨”了呢？埃及的经验可以说明。例如，去年12月，美国政府宣布准备资助埃及阿斯旺水坝建设第一期工程款项五千五百万美元（英国同时宣布资助一千五百万美元），这项资助本身没有条件，但是该款与世界银行准备同时贷与埃及的二亿美元应当作为一个整体，而世界银行的贷款则附有监督埃及财政的条件。纳赛尔总统今年12月10日接见意大利“时代报”记者时曾经表示：“他们把援助阿斯旺水坝建设工作的问题同一些能够使埃及沦为殖民地的条件联系在一起”。所谓“慷慨”，就是这样的。事实上，有的条件不一定是正式提出、明文规定的。譬如，美国经常从政治角度来考虑美“援”并加以控制。美国国际合作署署长霍利斯特曾经在记者招待会上公开表示，对于各国的计划“援助”数字不能公布，因为“鉴于全世界的变化局势，国际合作署必须保持很大的伸缩性，对于各国的计划或增或减，以便最有效地执行整个计划”。今年7月19日，美国政府突然宣布撤回“援助”阿斯旺水坝建设的建议，就是这种“伸缩性”的一个例子。
    据合众社记者汉斯莱12月12日自华盛顿报道，美国官员最近又表示，重新考虑帮助修建阿斯旺水坝的问题，但要看纳赛尔以后几个星期中的态度而定。显然美国还打算在对阿斯旺水坝建设计划“援助”问题上继续做文章。但是，通过美国在这一个具体“援助”问题上的反复无常，人们却更加看清了美“援”的政治企图。许多亚非国家对于美“援”特别警惕，是有充分的道理的。苏加诺总统曾经向美国人直率地说出了亚非人民对于这种自称为“慷慨”的美“援”的基本态度。他说：“当然，我们要接受援助，……可是，我们宁愿赤手空拳地在我们的土地上和丛林中进行劳动，也不愿意拿我们任何一部分自由去交换任何种类的援助”。
    亚非人民和世界其他各处的人民所要求的是自由、独立、进步、和平。为了这些，亚非人民和所有其他爱好和平的人民一样，愿意同所有的人合作，也随时准备对一切的敌人斗争。至于谁是朋友，谁是敌人，各国人民已经在实际生活中学会了从每个人的实际行动中去判断。“实力”政策的执行人目前这样宣传美国政策的“改变”，实际上只是挂上反殖民主义的招牌，打起和平的旗子，披上“慷慨的援助”的外衣，在亚非国家中钻空子，分化削弱世界和平民主力量，恢复“冷战”，制造紧张，在亚非地区和其他地区用伪善的面目进行帝国主义的扩张。但是，任何巧妙的伪装，也不能挽救美国“实力”政策必定失败的命运；亚非人民和各国爱好和平人民反对殖民主义和争取和平、进步的斗争，是不会因为美国的欺骗手段而稍为松懈的。
