Xinhua News Agency, Taunggyi, December 15th. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage arrived in Taunggyi, the capital of Shan State, by plane from Myitkyina on the 14th. Those who welcomed them at Heho Airport included Burmese Prime Minister U Ba Swe—who arrived earlier—Vice Prime Minister and Shan State Chief Sao Khun Cho, and other officials of the Shan State government.

　　Burmese Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu, who had accompanied the guests throughout the visit, departed from Taunggyi for Yangon.

　　The Chinese and Burmese government leaders drove from the airport to nearby Inle Lake. The Intha people held a spectacular boat race on the lake for the Chinese guests.

　　The Intha people are fishermen who migrated from the coast a long time ago. They now live in thatched huts on Inle Lake, supported by wooden pillars standing in the water.

　　The boat race was held in the center of the lake.

　　Lofty pavilions decorated with reeds and banana leaves were erected, and the Chinese guests ascended the pavilions. In front of the pavilions, there were three floating stages where beautifully dressed girls performed ethnic dances. Chinese and Burmese national flags fluttered all around on flagpoles erected in the water.

　　Not far away, on various small boats, thousands of men, women, and children gathered under a forest of umbrellas and flags to welcome the guests and watch the race.

　　Zhou Enlai and He Long rode to the race venue in a beautifully decorated barge that looked like a large peacock floating on the water, with a yellow-roofed pavilion and gilded pagoda on its back.

　　When thousands of spectators saw the approaching barge, they stood up and welcomed the Chinese guests with deafening cheers. The boat race began shortly after the Chinese guests arrived. The race boats were forty feet long, each with forty rowers wearing red shirts and dark shorts. As the race boats passed the barge where the Chinese and Burmese leaders were seated, the spectators threw their hats into the air and cheered loudly.

　　The rowers paddled in a unique way. They could stand on one foot and propel the oar forward with one arm and one leg.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai presented prizes to the winning men and women amidst warm applause. Many people danced on the boats.

　　After the boat race, the guests drove over the hills to Taunggyi, the capital of Shan State. A large portion of the city's more than 30,000 residents came to the streets to welcome the guests. Among them were Shan, Burmese, Indian, and Chinese people, as well as boys and girl scouts. Along the way, there were eleven welcoming arches with inscriptions that read: "Greetings to the Chinese Premier!" Taunggyi has more than ten thousand Indian and Chinese residents, who also erected arches to welcome the guests.

    缅甸东枝人民欢迎中国朋友
    新华社东枝15日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员在14日从密支那乘飞机到达掸邦首府东枝。到喜河机场欢迎他们的有缅甸总理吴巴瑞——他在早些时候抵达这里——、副总理和掸邦邦长藻昆卓，以及掸邦政府其他官员。
    一路陪着客人进行访问的缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努从东枝前往仰光。
    中国和缅甸的政府领袖们从机场驱车前往附近的英莱湖。因达族人民在湖上为中国客人们举行了精彩的划船比赛。
    因达族是很久以前从海滨迁移来的渔民。他们现在住在英莱湖边的茅草棚内，茅草棚用木柱支持，立在水中。
    划船比赛在湖的中心进行。
    高高耸立的阁楼装饰着芦苇和香蕉树叶，中国客人走上阁楼。在阁楼的前面，有三个浮动的舞台，穿得很漂亮的女孩子在台上表演民族舞蹈。四周飘扬着挂在立于水中的旗杆上的中国和缅甸的国旗。
    在不远的地方，在各式各样的小船上，好几千男人女人和小孩聚在林立的伞和旗帜下面欢迎客人并看比赛。
    周恩来和贺龙坐着装饰得很美丽的彩船到比赛地点去，这只彩船看来像浮在水上的大孔雀，在它的背上有着黄色屋顶的阁楼和镀金的宝塔。
    当好几千观众看到驶近的彩船时，他们站起来以震耳欲聋的欢呼声欢迎中国客人。在中国客人到达后不久，划船比赛就开始了。比赛的船只长四十英尺，每只船上有四十名身穿红色衬衣和深色短裤的划手。当比赛船只驶过中缅领袖所坐的彩船的时候，观众把帽子抛向空中并且高声欢呼。
    划船的人以一种独特的方法摇桨。他们能用一只脚站着，用一只手臂和一条腿推动桨前进。
    周恩来总理在热烈掌声中向男女优胜者颁发奖品。许多人在船上跳起舞来。
    在划船比赛以后，客人们乘汽车过山坡到达掸邦的首府东枝。这个城市的三万多居民中的很大一部分人到街上来欢迎客人。其中有掸族人、缅族人、印度人和中国人，有男女童子军。一路上搭有十一个欢迎的拱门，上面写着：“向中国总理致敬！”东枝有印度籍和中国籍的居民一万人以上，他们也搭起了拱门来欢迎客人。
