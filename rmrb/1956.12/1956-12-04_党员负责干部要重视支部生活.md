Party Member Leading Cadres Should Value Branch Life
　　Zhang Shihong
　　The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee Party Committee recently conducted a key investigation and found that it is a common phenomenon that cadres at the bureau and division chief level and above in its affiliated units do not participate in branch life on schedule.

　　"Busy" Cannot Be an Excuse for Regularly Not Participating in Branch Life
　　It is a fact that party member leading cadres have heavier work tasks, more meetings, and more opportunities to travel on business, and it is somewhat difficult to participate in branch life on schedule. Therefore, when they have legitimate reasons for not being able to attend branch or group meetings, it is permissible for them to ask the party organization for leave. But can being busy be a reason for party member leading cadres to not participate in branch life for a long time? No. According to the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee Party Committee's investigation, some party member leading cadres do not participate in branch life not always because they have legitimate reasons. Because these comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of participating in branch life and do not attach enough importance to it, they often could have participated but did not.
　　Zhang Suping, Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee and former Director of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building Office, did not participate in a single branch general meeting or party group meeting for a whole year from the second half of last year to the first half of this year. Of course, we cannot say that he was absent without reason every time, but can we really believe that he was so busy in a year that he didn't even have time to attend a single branch meeting or group meeting? When the party group leader once raised an opinion with him, his reply was: "Why do you have to drag me into your meetings?" This means that he regarded attending branch meetings and group meetings as a burden, which shows that he was not completely unable to participate, but unwilling to participate.
　　Chang Qing, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Second Heavy Industry Bureau, did not participate in a single branch general meeting in the first quarter of this year because he wanted to buy clothes for his children. We can believe that he sometimes has legitimate reasons for not being able to participate in branch life on schedule, but we cannot say that buying clothes for children can be a legitimate reason for not participating in branch life.
　　Zheng Zhongfang, Manager of the Shanghai Second Light Industry Bureau Pharmaceutical Industry Company, had not participated in branch life from June of last year to April of this year. Once, the party group leader asked him to attend a party group meeting to listen to the party group's criticisms of him, but he still did not participate. Obviously, for him, "busy" is an excuse to avoid criticism.
　　Not all party member leading cadres treat branch life in this way. Those leading comrades with a strong sense of organization and who value branch life are able to regularly participate in branch meetings, which is also a strong proof that "busy" cannot be a reason for not participating in branch life for a long time. For example, Sun Yu, Director of the Shanghai First Light Industry Bureau Office, never misses a branch meeting or group meeting unless he has special matters; Liang Tingjin, President of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China, consistently actively participates in branch life except for emergency meetings or business trips. There are many such comrades. There is no reason to say that the work of these comrades is easier than that of the comrades mentioned above.

　　Cannot Use a Liberal Attitude and the Identity of a Leader to Participate in Branch Life
　　Some party member leading cadres do not value branch life, which is not only manifested in not participating in branch life, but also in other aspects. Some comrades are extremely unserious even when they attend branch meetings. Look at the attitude of some division chief-level party member cadres in the Shanghai First Light Industry Bureau towards branch meetings: Division Chief Wen Zhongning still waits to finish a game of chess before participating when the branch general meeting has already started, and he lies on the sofa reading a newspaper when he participates; Division Chief Wang Hengshan is often late and leaves early for party group meetings, and lectures other comrades at the meeting as a leader; Division Chief Lin Hong is not present when notified of a meeting, saying that he "forgot." Because these comrades adopt such a liberal attitude towards branch life, this often affects the timely and smooth convening of branch meetings; affects the enthusiasm of cadres in doing party work, and makes the branch life of these organs fall into a state of laxity and drift.
　　Regularly not participating in branch life is neglecting the supervision of the Party. Now is the time to eliminate this phenomenon.

　　Some party member leading cadres think that they regularly participate in other various party meetings and regularly accept the leadership of the higher-level party committee in their work, so not participating in branch life is unimportant. This idea is wrong. Participating in other party meetings or accepting the leadership of the higher-level party committee in work is one part of party life, while participating in branch life is another part of party life. The Party Constitution stipulates that all party members should participate in party life. For every party member, branch life is an important aspect of party life. Since a party member leading cadre is a member of the party organization in his own organ, he should abide by the party's discipline and participate in branch life like all other party members. It should be seen that it is very important for party member leading cadres to participate in branch life. First of all, as the Party Constitution points out, the party's grassroots organizations in the organs should supervise the ideological and political situation of every party member (including administrative heads) in the organs. Party members participate in branch life, which is to maintain close contact with the organization and accept the supervision of the Party. A party member, if he does not participate in branch life for a long time and does not receive the supervision of the grassroots party organization, will affect his political development, affect his timely overcoming of his own shortcomings in thinking and work, affect the continuous improvement of his professional level, and may even be in danger of being separated from the Party and the masses. The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China requires us to strengthen the Party's leadership and supervision over the work of all departments, strengthen the Party's collective leadership, and fully promote inner-Party democracy. In this way, the significance of party member leading cadres themselves accepting the supervision of the party organization over their ideological and political situation becomes even more important.

　　Party Member Leading Cadres Should Take the Lead in Participating in Branch Life
　　Secondly, the attitude of a party member leading cadre towards branch life will not only affect other comrades, but also affect the development of branch work in the entire unit. The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee Party Committee found in this inspection that in units where party member leading cadres attach importance to and actively participate in branch life, branch life is relatively normal and active, and the democratic atmosphere within the Party is relatively strong. For example, the Director and Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Procuratorate attach great importance to branch life, are very concerned about the ideological situation of party members and non-party masses, personally do ideological work, and can take the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism at party meetings, which greatly facilitates the development of the general branch committee's work. The branch life of this unit is very regular, and every party member dares to put forward various criticisms and suggestions to the administrative leading party members at party meetings, helping the leading comrades to improve their leadership style and leadership methods in a timely manner. In this way, the work of the entire organ is also very promising. In the opposite situation, such as in the organs of those party member leading cadres who do not value branch life as mentioned above, the development of branch work is subject to certain resistance, and the leading role of the party organization is relatively weak.
　　After the implementation of the resolution of the Municipal Party Congress, the above situation has undergone preliminary changes. For this reason, we hope that these party member leading cadres will seriously study the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, improve their understanding of the significance of branch life, strive to participate in branch life more often, accept the Party's supervision of their personal ideological and political situation, and assist the branch in doing party work well. Only in this way can they better fulfill the increasingly arduous new tasks entrusted to them by the Party.

### 党员负责干部要重视支部生活

　　党员负责干部要重视支部生活
　　章世鸿
    上海市人民委员会机关党委会前些日子进行了一次重点调查，发现所属各单位局、处长以上干部不按期过支部生活是一个比较普遍的现象。
      “忙”不能成为经常不参加支部生活的借口
    党员负责干部工作任务较重，会议较多，出差的机会也多，按期过支部生活有一定的困难，这是事实。因而当他们确有正当理由不能参加支部或小组的会议的时候，他们向党组织请假是可以允许的。但工作忙能不能成为党员负责干部长期不过支部生活的理由呢？不能。根据上海市人民委员会机关党委这次了解，有些党员负责干部不过支部生活并非每次都有正当理由的。由于这些同志对参加支部生活的意义认识不足，重视不够，他们往往是可以争取参加而没有参加。
    上海市人民委员会副秘书长、前中苏友好大厦办公室主任张苏平，去年下半年到今年上半年，整整一年没有参加过一次支部大会和党的小组会。当然，不能说他全是无故缺席，但难道能够相信他在一年中真的忙到这种程度，竟连参加一次支部会和小组会的时间都没有吗？当党的小组长有一次对他提出意见时，他的答复是：“为什么你们开会一定要拖住我？”这就是说，他把参加支部会和小组会当作是一种负担，可见他并非完全不能参加，而是不愿参加。
    上海第二重工业局副局长常青在今年第一季度为了要给小孩子买衣服，就不参加一次支部大会。我们可以相信他不能按期参加支部生活有时是有正当理由的，但总不能说给孩子买衣服也能成为不过支部生活的正当理由。
    上海第二轻工业局制药工业公司经理郑仲芳自去年6月到今年4月份一直没有过支部生活。有一次党小组长要他参加党小组会，听取党小组对他的批评意见，他还是不参加。显然，对于他，“忙”是一种逃避批评的借口。
    不是所有党员负责干部都是如此对待支部生活的，那些组织观念较强、重视支部生活的领导同志能够经常参加支部会议，这也是“忙”不能成为长期不过支部生活的一个有力的证明。譬如，上海市第一轻工业局办公室主任孙愈，凡是开支部会和小组会，只要他没有特殊事情，从不缺席；中国人民银行上海分行行长梁廷锦除紧急会议或出差外，一贯积极地参加支部生活，这样的同志是不少的。决没有理由说这些同志的工作要比上面指出的那些同志要轻松些。
    不能用自由主义的态度和首长的身份来参加支部生活
    某些党员负责干部不重视支部生活，不但表现在不过支部生活方面，还表现在其他方面。有些同志即使参加了支部会议，态度也是极其不严肃的。请看上海第一轻工业局一些处长级党员干部对支部会议的态度：处长温众宁，开支部大会时间已到，他还要等下完一盘棋后再参加，而参加时还躺在沙发上读报；处长王衡山出席党小组会常迟到早退，在会上以首长姿态对其他同志训话；处长林洪，通知他开会不到，说是“忘了”。由于这些同志对支部生活采取了如此自由主义的态度，这就往往影响支部会议的及时和顺利召开；影响干部做党的工作的积极性，使这些机关的支部生活陷于松懈、自流的境地。
    经常不参加支部生活就是忽视党的监督现在应该是消除这种现象的时候了。
    有些党员负责干部以为他们经常参加其他各种党的会议，在工作中经常接受上级党委的领导，因此不参加支部生活是无关紧要的。这种想法是错误的。参加其他党的会议或在工作中接受上级党委的领导，这是党的生活的一部分，而参加支部生活，这是党的生活的另一部分。党章规定，凡是党员都应该参加党的生活。对每个党员来说，支部生活是党的生活的一个重要方面。党员负责干部本人既然是本机关党组织的一个成员，那他就应该遵守党的纪律，像所有其他党员一样过支部生活。应该看到，党员负责干部参加支部生活是十分重要的。首先，正如党章所指出，机关的党的基层组织应当对机关中每一个党员（包括行政负责人）的思想政治情况进行监督，党员参加支部生活，这就是和组织保持紧密的联系，接受党的监督。一个党员，如果长期不过支部生活，得不到基层党组织对他的监督，就会影响他的政治上的开展，影响他及时地克服自己思想上工作上的缺点，影响他的业务水平的不断提高，最后甚至有脱离党，脱离群众的危险。党的第八次全国代表大会要求我们加强党对各部门工作的领导和监督，加强党的集体领导，充分发扬党内民主，这样，党员负责干部本身接受党组织对他的思想政治情况的监督，其意义就显得更加重要。
    党员负责干部应该以身作则参加支部生活
    其次，一个党员负责干部对支部生活的态度不但会影响其他同志，而且会影响到整个单位的支部工作的开展。上海市人民委员会机关党委会在这次检查中发现，凡是党员负责干部重视并积极参加支部生活的单位，支部生活就比较正常、活跃，党内的民主空气就比较浓厚。如上海市人民监察院院长和副院长对支部生活都很重视，对党员和非党群众的思想情况也很关心，亲自做思想工作，并且能够以身作则在党的会议上开展批评和自我批评，这就大大有利于总支委员会的工作的开展。这个单位支部生活过得很经常，每个党员都敢于在党的会议上对行政领导党员提出各种批评意见，帮助领导同志及时改进领导作风和领导方法。这样，整个机关的工作也就很有起色。在相反的情况下，如上面所指出的这些党员负责干部不重视支部生活的机关，支部工作的开展就受到一定的阻力，党组织的领导作用是比较薄弱的。
    在贯彻执行市的党代表会议决议之后，上面这种情况已有了初步的改变。为此，我们希望这些党员负责干部认真学习党的第八次全国代表大会的文件，提高对支部生活的意义的认识，争取更多地参加支部生活，接受党对个人的思想政治情况的监督，并且协助支部做好党的工作。只有这样，他们才能更好地实现党所交给他们的日益艰巨的新的任务。
