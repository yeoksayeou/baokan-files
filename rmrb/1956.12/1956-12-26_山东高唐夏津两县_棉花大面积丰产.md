Xinhua News Agency, Liaocheng Dispatch: Gaotang and Xiajin counties in Shandong Province, two large-scale cotton bumper harvest demonstration counties, have achieved an average yield of over 70 jin per mu (seed cotton, same below) on nearly one million mu of cotton. The average yield per mu in Gaotang County is 70.7 jin, an increase of 68.5% compared to last year. The average yield per mu in Xiajin County is 70 jin, an increase of 40% compared to last year. The two counties have more than 100,000 mu of high-yield cotton fields, generally yielding over 100 jin per mu, with some reaching as high as 260 jin.

This year, the 356 advanced agricultural cooperatives in these two counties universally combined their local conditions to promote the experience of large-scale cotton bumper harvests from the Xinjiang region. They achieved early sowing, early thinning, early pest control, and early fertilization; to avoid fertilizer loss, they implemented ditch application of fertilizer; to eliminate pests, they eliminated weeds and mulberry stumps in the fields and village edges before cotton sowing. Recently, the agricultural departments of Shandong Province and Liaocheng Prefecture systematically summarized the experience of large-scale cotton bumper harvests in these two counties.

    山东高唐夏津两县
    棉花大面积丰产
    据新华社聊城电　山东省高唐和夏津两个棉花大面积丰产示范县，近一百万亩棉花每亩平均产量达到七十斤以上（皮棉，下同）。高唐县每亩平均产量是七十点七斤，比去年增产68.5％。夏津县每亩平均产量是七十斤，比去年增产40％。两个县有十万多亩高额丰产棉田，一般每亩在一百斤以上，有的高达二百六十多斤。
    今年，这两个县的三百五十六个高级农业社普遍结合当地情况，推广了新疆地区棉花大面积丰产的经验。他们做到了早播种、早间苗、早治虫、早施肥；为避免肥料流失，实行了开沟追肥的办法；为了除虫，在棉花播种前就消除了地头村边等处的杂草和桑墩。最近，山东省和聊城专署的农业部门系统地总结了这两个县棉花大面积丰产的经验。
