    Strive to Reduce Commodity Circulation Links and Appropriately Adjust Prices of Agricultural and Sideline Products
    Excessive Purchase and Sale Price Difference in Sheepskin Due to Too Many Intermediate Links
    The commercial departments in Zhangjiakou Special District, Hebei Province, have excessively large differences in the purchase price and sales price of sheep and sheepskin, which has aroused dissatisfaction among farmers.
    When farmers in this area transferred their sheep to cooperatives at a discounted price, the average price was 10 to 12 yuan per head. However, this autumn, the price sold to the local food company and supply and marketing cooperative was only 5 to 7 yuan per head on average. The purchase price of sheepskin is less than 3 yuan per piece on average, but if a farmer buys a sheepskin jacket from the supply and marketing cooperative, it costs an average of 40 yuan. However, if the farmer tans the leather himself and makes the jacket himself, four pieces of leather and four days of work are enough. According to the supply and marketing cooperative's purchase price of 3 yuan per sheepskin, four pieces of leather cost 12 yuan, and even with labor costs, it is still 24 yuan cheaper than a leather jacket sold by the supply and marketing cooperative.
    Why is the purchase and sale price difference of sheepskin so large? It is understood that this is mainly caused by too many intermediate links and large profits in the purchasing departments. For example, from the purchase of leather to the sale of leather jackets, it needs to go through seven or eight links: the grassroots supply and marketing cooperative buys the sheepskin and sends it to the county supply and marketing cooperative, the county cooperative sends it to the special district cooperative, the special district cooperative sends it to the agricultural product purchasing bureau, and then the processing plant processes it into tanned leather, which is then distributed by the supply and marketing cooperative to the grassroots cooperative level by level and sold to farmers. At the same time, there is no fur processing factory in the Zhangjiakou area, and the purchased fur has to be transported to Shijiazhuang for processing, which increases the cost of fur products due to round-trip transportation costs.
    I suggest that commercial departments improve their operations and reduce some unnecessary commodity circulation links in order to appropriately reduce commodity costs. This will not only satisfy farmers but also be welcomed by consumers. 　　　　　　Lin Xiao
    Raw Lacquer Purchase Price Too Low
    Raw lacquer is one of China's important specialties, mainly produced in Guizhou, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other places. Raw lacquer has a high degree of anti-corrosion and acid resistance, and is a very good coating material with a wide range of uses. Building materials and production tools such as steel and wood can increase their value and extend their service life when coated with lacquer. Utensils made of raw lacquer are not only durable but also beautiful in color. The bodiless lacquerware of Fujian and the carved lacquer of Beijing and Jiangsu are all made of raw lacquer.
    Raw lacquer is the resin of the lacquer tree, which is a perennial deciduous tree, divided into large lacquer trees and small lacquer trees. Large lacquer trees can be tapped for lacquer after about eight years of cultivation and can live for about 30 years; small lacquer trees can be tapped for lacquer after about six years of cultivation and can live for about 20 years. Lacquer trees with fertile soil and good development can be tapped three times in seven years, and those with poor development can be tapped twice in five years, each time yielding about one jin of raw lacquer.
    China is a lacquer-producing country. In the past, raw lacquer could not only meet the needs of the domestic people, but also be sold in large quantities abroad. However, in recent years, the production of raw lacquer has developed very slowly, while the demand at home and abroad has become larger and larger, which has led to a tense situation of supply falling short of demand. The main reason for the slow development of raw lacquer production is that the purchasing departments have insufficient understanding of the production characteristics of raw lacquer and the purchase price is too low.
    Lacquer trees grow slowly, have low yields, and lacquer tapping requires strong technical skills. The quality of raw lacquer, the amount of future production, and the lifespan of lacquer trees are all directly related to the lacquer tapping technique. Lacquer tapping also requires strong labor, climbing lacquer trees that are several zhang high. Moreover, raw lacquer is toxic, and people who are weak or sensitive to raw lacquer may get lacquer sores from tapping lacquer. However, these characteristics were not fully taken into account when formulating the purchase price of raw lacquer, and the price was set too low. Although adjustments have been made in various places this year, farmers still feel that they are at a disadvantage and are unwilling to collect lacquer. Lacquer trees with fertile soil and good development only yield six jin of lacquer per tree in twenty years, and 30 trees are cultivated per mu, for a total harvest of 180 jin in twenty years. If calculated at the current purchase price of 1.6 yuan per jin in Hubei Province, the total income is 288 yuan, with an average annual income of 14.4 yuan per mu; however, planting tea can generate an income of 73.5 yuan per mu per year. In the past, one jin of raw lacquer could be exchanged for two jin of tree fungus, but now one jin of tree fungus can be exchanged for two jin of raw lacquer. Farmers see that tapping raw lacquer is not as profitable as operating other cash crops, so they not only do not cultivate new lacquer trees or actively look for new lacquer forests, but they are not even interested in collecting the raw lacquer that should be harvested, and even cut down lacquer trees to plant tea trees, causing serious damage to raw lacquer production.
    Many areas in China are suitable for the growth of lacquer trees, and many wild lacquer forests have been discovered in the southern provinces. If the relevant departments in the lacquer-producing areas pay attention to the leadership of raw lacquer production and stipulate reasonable purchase prices, raw lacquer production can be developed quickly. 　　　　　Chen Xin
    A Price Difference of More Than Ten Yuan Per Dan of Tung Seeds Between Two Places Twenty Li Apart
    This year, the purchase price of tung seeds in Yuqian County, Zhejiang Province, is 20.4 yuan per dan, and the purchase price of tung seeds in Ningguo County, Anhui Province, is 32 yuan per dan, a difference of 11.6 yuan (Yuqian County and Ningguo County are only 20 li apart). Farmers in Yuqian County, seeing that the purchase price in Ningguo County is high, are unwilling to sell tung seeds to the purchasing station in their own county, but cross the precipitous "Qianqiu Pass" to sell them in Ningguo County. Yuqian County has more convenient transportation than Ningguo County. In the past, some products flowed from Ningguo to Yuqian, but none flowed from Yuqian to Ningguo for sale. However, this year, more than 100,000 jin of tung seeds have flowed back to Ningguo, resulting in a waste of financial and human resources.
    The masses have a lot of opinions on the inconsistent purchase prices in the two neighboring areas. Some farmers went to the Yuqian purchasing station to request the return of the tung seeds they had already sold. This situation not only aroused dissatisfaction among the farmers, but also affected the supply of raw materials for the oil and fat departments in Yuqian County.
    It is said that the low price for purchasing tung seeds in Yuqian County is due to the instructions of the Grain Bureau of Zhejiang Province. Relevant departments should inspect and resolve these issues.

    力求减少商品流转环节，适当调整农副产品价格
    羊皮购销差价过大  原因是中间环节太多
    河北省张家口专区商业部门在羊和羊皮的收购价格同销售价格上相差过大，引起农民不满。
    这个地区农民的羊在折价入社时，一般每只平均十元到十二元，可是，今年秋季卖给当地食品公司和供销社的价格每只平均只有五元到七元。羊皮收购价平均每张不到三元，而农民向供销社买一件上身皮袄平均需要四十元，但是，如果是农民自己熟皮，自己做皮袄，四张皮子四个工就可以做出来了。按照供销社收购羊皮每张三元计算，四张皮子合十二元，加上人工，还要比供销社卖出的皮衣每件便宜二十四元。
    为什么羊皮的购销差价这么大呢？据了解，主要是收购部门中间环节多和利润大所造成的。比如从收买皮子到出售皮袄，中间需要经过七、八个环节：基层供销社把羊皮收买上来后送到县供销社，县社送到专区社，专区社再送到农产品采购局，然后经过加工厂制成熟皮，再由供销社逐级下放到基层社，卖给农民。同时，张家口地区没有皮毛加工厂，所收购的皮毛，还要运到石家庄去加工，往返的运费，也加大了皮毛制品的成本。
    我建议商业部门改进经营，减少一些不必要的商品流转环节，以便适当降低商品成本。这样，不但会使农民满意，而且会受到广大消费者欢迎。　　　　　　林虓
    生漆收购价格太低了
    生漆是我国的重要特产之一，主要出产在贵州、湖北、四川、陕西等地。生漆具有高度的防腐、御酸作用，是一种很好的涂料，用途很广。钢铁、木材等建筑材料和生产工具，涂上漆就可以提高使用价值，延长使用时间。用生漆涂制的用具，不但经久耐用，而且色泽美观。福建的脱胎漆器，北京、江苏的雕漆，都是用生漆制成的。
    生漆是漆树的树脂，漆树是一种多年生的落叶乔木，分大木漆和小木漆两种，大木漆树栽培八年左右开始割漆，一株可活到三十年左右；小木漆树栽培六年左右开始割漆，可活二十年左右。土壤肥沃、发育良好的漆树七年可割三次，发育不好的五年可割两次，每次可以割到一市斤左右的生漆。
    我国是一个产漆的国家，过去生漆不但能满足国内人民的需要，还大量销到国外。可是这几年来，生漆生产发展得很缓慢，而国内外的需要量却越来越大，这就出现了供不应求的紧张情况。生漆生产发展缓慢的主要原因是收购部门对生漆的生产特点认识不足，收购价格偏低。
    漆树生长慢、产量少，而且割漆技术性强。生漆的质量好坏、今后产量的多少、漆树的寿命长短，都和割漆的技术有直接关系，割漆还需要强的劳动力，要爬上几丈高的漆树。而且生漆含有毒性，体质较弱或对生漆有敏感性的人，割漆会中毒生漆疮。但是在制定生漆收购价格的时候并没有充分地注意到这些特点，定得偏低了。今年虽然各地曾作了些调整，但农民还是感到吃亏，不愿采漆。土壤肥沃发育较好的漆树，每棵树二十年才割到六斤漆，每亩栽培三十棵，二十年共收割一百八十斤，若按湖北省现在的收购价每斤一元六角计算，共收入二百八十八元，每亩每年平均收入十四元四角；可是种茶叶每年每亩地就可以收入七十三元五角。这个地方过去是一斤生漆换二斤木耳，现在是一斤木耳换两斤生漆。农民看到采割生漆不如经营别的经济作物有利，不但不培植新的漆树、不积极寻找新漆林，就连应该收割的生漆也没有兴趣去收割，甚至把漆树砍掉改种茶树，给生漆生产造成了严重的损失。
    我国有很多地区适合漆树生长，在南方各省还发现了很多野生的漆树林。如果各产漆地区有关部门重视了生漆生产的领导，又规定出合理的收购价格，生漆生产很快就能发展起来。　　　　　陈信
    两地相距二十里一担桐子价格相差十多元
    今年，浙江省于潜县每担桐子的收购价是二十元四角，安徽省宁国县每担桐子的收购价是三十二元，相差十一元六角（于潜县和宁国县相距仅二十里）。于潜县农民见宁国县收购价高，便不愿意把桐子售给本县收购站，而越过峭峻的“千秋关”到宁国县去出售。于潜县比宁国县交通便利，过去有些产品，都是由宁国流向于潜的，没有从于潜倒流到宁国去出售的。可是，今年已有十多万斤桐子倒流到宁国去了，形成财力和人力的浪费。
    群众对两个毗邻地区收购价不一致，很有意见。有的农民到于潜采购站要求退回已出售的桐子。这种情况，不仅引起农民的不满情绪，也使于潜县油脂部门的原料供应受到影响。
    于潜县收购桐子价格低，据说是浙江省粮食厅指示执行的。有关部门应检查解决这些问题。
