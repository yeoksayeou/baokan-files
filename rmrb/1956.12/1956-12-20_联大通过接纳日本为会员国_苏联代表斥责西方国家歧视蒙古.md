Xinhua News Agency, December 19th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session unanimously passed a resolution on the 18th to admit Japan as a member of the United Nations, thereby increasing the number of UN member states from seventy-nine to eighty.

The General Assembly adopted the resolution to admit Japan as a member state based on the unanimous recommendation of the Security Council and a proposal, ultimately co-sponsored by fifty-one countries, requesting Japan's admission.

Soviet delegation leader Kuznetsov spoke, welcoming Japan's entry into the United Nations. He considered this a step forward for the United Nations towards becoming a universal organization. Kuznetsov said that if Japan could pursue a policy of safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world within the United Nations, it would be beneficial to the UN organization.

Kuznetsov condemned the discrimination against the Mongolian People's Republic while admitting Japan.

Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu spoke at the General Assembly, expressing gratitude for Japan's admission to the United Nations.

After admitting Japan as a member state, the General Assembly proceeded to elect members of the International Law Commission. At the suggestion of Latin American countries, the General Assembly decided to increase the number of members of this commission from fifteen to twenty-one to accommodate the increase in UN member states. The General Assembly then elected representatives from twenty-one countries, including the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, India, Japan, and Brazil, as members of the commission.

The General Assembly then continued to discuss amending the Charter to increase the membership of various UN bodies.

Representatives from Albania, Ukraine, and Romania emphasized the necessity of abiding by the United Nations Charter. They pointed out that excluding the People's Republic of China from the United Nations was a serious violation of the Charter, and this phenomenon must be eliminated.

The Yugoslav representative said that while he supported in principle expanding the membership of the Security Council, he believed that this issue required careful consideration and should not rush to amend the UN Charter.

Representatives from Australia, Canada, and the United States expressed support for the twenty-nation proposal to increase the non-permanent members of the Security Council from six to eight. The US representative also stated that he opposed the Soviet representative's opinion that the General Assembly should first restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations before discussing amending the Charter.
