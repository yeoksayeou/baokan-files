Raise sideline production, but don't slack off on agriculture.

An'yang criticizes one-sided views, rapidly igniting a production surge.

    After criticizing the tendency of leaders in winter production to neglect agricultural production, An'yang County, Henan Province, swiftly ignited a production surge throughout the county.

    This county was originally a heavily afflicted disaster area. Although it had completed more than 60% of the county's disaster relief tasks in over three months, a general tendency to focus solely on sideline production and neglect agricultural production existed from top to bottom since the start of winter. Some district and township cadres believed that sideline production earned money faster and eliminated disasters more quickly, so they abandoned leadership over agricultural production. Some agricultural cooperatives even mistakenly engaged in purely commercial activities. In Cuijiaqiao District, the Party branch secretaries of various townships focused on sideline production, and the township and cooperative heads engaged in unified purchase and sales, while agricultural production was left without anyone responsible. In order to vigorously develop sideline production, the district leadership even convened a meeting of district, township, and cooperative cadres to introduce the experience of Yangxinzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in developing sideline production, but rarely introduced methods of integrating agricultural and sideline production, which misled many agricultural cooperatives, so the majority of the labor force was invested in sideline production.

    After discovering the above tendency, the An'yang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an emergency telephone instruction on December 2 to the leading cadres of various districts, townships, and cooperatives to comprehensively carry out a production increase and economy drive that combined agricultural and sideline production. The County Committee divided responsibilities, with County Committee Secretary Feng Zhicheng and Deputy Secretary Yang Youzhen specifically leading the production for self-salvation and agricultural increase movement, and successively transferred more than 190 cadres to go to the countryside to help various townships and cooperatives improve agricultural production. Under the leadership of the County Committee, the various cooperatives generally summarized the previous stage of production, inspected and criticized the tendency to neglect winter agricultural production, carried out investigations and calculations, and comprehensively planned winter production. The county's agricultural and sideline production increase movement was launched on a large scale. Although the weather is currently severely cold, the fields are full of people watering wheat, pulling flower stalks, and plowing for the winter. In the entire county, the labor force participating in agricultural production in 270 cooperatives accounts for 50%-70% of the total labor force. All agricultural cooperatives are paying attention to planning the labor force, dividing leadership, and ensuring that agricultural and sideline production are not neglected. The Songtao Agricultural Cooperative extracted 400 male and female laborers for winter plowing, manure accumulation, wheat watering, and flower stalk pulling, and divided more than 200 laborers to engage in sideline production. As a result, 1,600 mu of winter plowing was completed, and sideline production earned 15,000 yuan. As of December 9, the county had completed more than 630,000 mu of winter plowing, 191 cooperatives had ended or basically ended winter plowing; 211 cooperatives had winter watered more than 200,000 mu of wheat, and 34 cooperatives had completely completed the winter watering task; 301 cooperatives had accumulated more than 400,000 cartloads of fertilizer.

Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law compete to go to the fields, old and strong compare their abilities

Wen'shang's winter production is active, with even greater achievements than last winter

    Farmers in Wen'shang County, Shandong, have won a victory on the agricultural production front this winter. According to the recent statistics of the Office of the Wen'shang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the current production achievements have exceeded those of last winter: last winter, the winter-plowed land accounted for 75% of the arable land, and this year all arable land has been winter-plowed; last winter, 358 brick wells were dug, and this winter 749 have been dug, and 1,186 old wells have been repaired; last winter, more than 557,000 large carts of fertilizer were accumulated, and this winter more than 568,000 large carts have been accumulated. At the same time, the area of wheat watering, topdressing, and wheat rolling has also greatly exceeded that of last winter.

    On the 15th, the weather was very cold, but the farmers of Wen'shang County were still actively engaged in production. On that day, in the fields, people were as busy as in spring; on the roads connecting the villages, the vehicles were constantly running. The Chenguang Agricultural Production Cooperative, with only more than 260 households, had more than 530 people participating in activities such as plowing and manure accumulation that day. Han Dezhi's mother, who is already 53 years old, is still competing with her daughter-in-law to go to the fields to work. Han Jiwen, who is 74 years old, also participated in pushing soil to pad the fields and was shouting slogans to compete with young people. Guo Tingshen, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and Li Qishan, a member of the Communist Youth League, of the Guoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative, also braved the severe cold to take off their trousers and roll up their sleeves to go into the water to dredge the well that day.

    把积极性更高度地发扬起来
    副业应当搞，农业不可松
    安阳批判片面观点  迅速掀起生产热潮
    河南省安阳县在批判领导冬季生产中忽视农业生产的偏向后，全县迅速掀起了生产热潮。
    这个县，本来是个重灾县。三个多月中，虽已完成全县救灾任务的60％以上，但在入冬以来，全县从上而下普遍存在着只搞副业、忽视农业生产的偏向。有的区、乡干部认为副业赚钱快，消灭灾荒来的急，就放弃了对农业生产的领导，甚至个别农业社还错误地搞纯商业性的活动。崔家桥区各乡党支部书记抓副业，乡、社长搞统销，而农业生产处于无人负责状态；这个区领导上为了大力开展副业，还特地召开区、乡、社干部会议介绍杨辛庄农业社开展副业生产的经验，但很少介绍农副业结合的办法，使不少农业社产生了错觉，所以绝大部分劳力都投入到副业生产方面去。
    中共安阳县委发现上述偏向后，于12月2日电话紧急指示各区、乡、社的领导干部，全面开展农副业相结合的增产节约运动。县委分工负责，由县委书记冯志诚、副书记杨有珍具体领导生产自救和农业增产运动，并先后抽调干部一百九十多人下乡帮助各乡、社搞好农业生产。在县委的领导下，各社普遍通过总结前段生产，检查批判忽视冬季农业生产的偏向，开展查算，全面规划了冬季生产，全县农副业增产运动就大规模地开展起来。目前虽然天气严寒，但是田野里遍地都是浇麦、拔花柴、冬耕的人群。全县有二百七十个社参加农业生产的劳力占全部劳力的50％—70％，各个农业社都注意规划劳力、分工领导，作到农副业生产两不误。松涛农业社抽出四百个男女劳力冬耕、积肥、浇麦、拔花柴，分出二百多个劳力搞副业。结果一千六百亩冬耕完成了，副业又收入一万五千元。截止12月9日，全县已完成冬耕六十三万多亩，有一百九十一个社已经结束或基本结束冬耕；有二百一十一个社冬浇小麦二十多万亩，有三十四个社全部完成了冬浇任务；三百零一个社已积肥四十多万车。

    婆媳争下地、老壮比高低
    汶上冬季生产活跃  比去冬的成绩还大
    在今冬的农业生产战线上，山东汶上县农民打了胜仗。据中共汶上县委办公室的最近统计，现在的生产成绩已超过去年冬季：去年冬耕地占宜耕地的75％，今年宜耕地全部进行了冬耕；去冬打砖井三百五十八眼，今冬已打了七百四十九眼，还修理旧井一千一百八十六眼；去冬积肥五十五万七千多大车，今冬已积了五十六万八千多大车。同时，浇麦、追肥、砘麦的面积也大大超过去冬。
    15日的天气非常冷，汶上县农民仍然积极地投入生产。那天，在田野里，人们像春天一样的繁忙；相联各村的道路上，运转的车辆络绎不绝。仅有二百六十多户的晨光农业生产合作社，这天参加翻地、积肥等活动的就有五百三十多人。韩德志的母亲，已是五十三岁的老人，仍与儿媳争着下地干活。七十四岁的韩吉文，也参加推土垫栏，还喊着号子与年轻人比高低。国光农业生产合作社的中共党员郭廷申、青年团员李岐山等人，这天也冒着严寒赤腿捋袖下水掏井。
