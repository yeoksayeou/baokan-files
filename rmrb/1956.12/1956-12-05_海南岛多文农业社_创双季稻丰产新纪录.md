　  Hainan Island Duowen Agricultural Cooperative
　  Sets New Record for Double-Season Rice Production
    This newspaper reports: The Duowen Agricultural Production Cooperative in Duowen Township, Lingao County, Hainan Island, has created the highest yield record for double-season rice in the country. The cooperative's "Duo Hongtian" (local name) field, measuring 1.2 mu, yielded 1,484 jin of rice in the early season crop (weighed after one day of sun-drying) and 1,215 jin of rice in the late season crop (weighed after two days of sun-drying). This field averaged an annual yield of 2,249 jin of dry grain per mu. This yield figure is 321 jin more than the yield of the 1.88 mu high-yield field of the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, this year. The cooperative has 292 mu of high-yield double-season rice fields (accounting for slightly more than 12% of the cooperative's double-season rice area), with an annual yield of over 1,000 jin of dry grain per mu, of which 56 mu have an annual yield of 1,500 jin to 1,600 jin of dry grain per mu.
    The Duowen Cooperative has consecutively created high-yield records of 1,000 jin per mu during last year's autumn harvest and this year's summer harvest. This year, drawing on past high-yield experience, the cooperative promoted technical reforms centered on small seedling close planting, thus achieving large-scale high yields.

　  海南岛多文农业社
　  创双季稻丰产新纪录
    本报讯　海南岛临高县多文乡多文农业生产合作社创造了全国双季水稻最高产量纪录。该社的“多红田”（土名）一亩二分，早造收稻谷一千四百八十四斤（晒一日后过秤）、晚造收稻谷一千二百一十五斤（晒两日后过秤），这丘田平均一亩年产干谷二千二百四十九斤。这个产量数字比广东省揭阳县云光农业社今年的一点八八亩丰产田的产量还多三百二十一斤多。该社有二百九十二亩双季稻丰产田（占全社双季稻面积12％强），每亩年产干谷一千斤以上，其中有五十六亩每亩年产干谷一千五百斤至一千六百斤。
    多文社于去年秋收和今年夏收接连创造每亩千斤的丰产纪录。今年吸取了以往的丰产经验，推行了以小棵密植为中心的技术改革，因而获得了大面积丰产。　（新海南报编辑部）
