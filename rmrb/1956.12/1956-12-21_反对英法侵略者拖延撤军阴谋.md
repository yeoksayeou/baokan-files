    Oppose the Anglo-French Aggressors' Conspiracy to Delay Withdrawal
    The conspiracy of Britain and France, colluding with the United States, to use the name of the United Nations forces to interfere in Egyptian sovereignty and occupy the Suez Canal is now becoming increasingly clear.
    Throughout the period since Britain and France announced their withdrawal from Egypt, they have, on the one hand, remained silent about a final deadline for withdrawing their invading forces from Port Said, while, on the other hand, clamoring for the immediate commencement of the Suez Canal clearing operation, and insisting that Egypt agree to the use of Anglo-French naval salvage fleets in the clearing operation. They are attempting to disguise a part of the Anglo-French navy that invaded Egypt as salvage vessels and personnel for clearing the canal, so as to continue to remain in the Suez Canal area in order to realize their ambition to seize the Suez Canal.
    Now, the Anglo-French aggressors are using unprecedentedly brutal and despicable pressure on Egypt, attempting to force Egypt to concede. Almost twenty days have passed since Lloyd announced on December 3 that Britain and France would "unhesitatingly withdraw" their invading forces from Egypt. Although they have withdrawn a portion of the invading troops, they still have some refusing to leave the coast of Port Said, and are even allowing their invading soldiers to continue to massacre the Egyptian people on a large scale in Port Said, openly looting private homes and shops. They are clearly using the delay in troop withdrawal and barbaric massacres to intimidate Egypt, attempting to force Egypt to accept their withdrawal conditions.
    At the same time, Britain and France are "threatening" the United Nations, attempting to exert pressure on Egypt through the United Nations. They even openly set a date, demanding that the United Nations force Egypt to accept the Anglo-French salvage fleet, otherwise they would sink the salvaged ships back to the bottom of the canal. The Anglo-French aggressors have been in frequent contact and bargaining with American Lieutenant General Wheeler, who is responsible for the Suez Canal clearing operation, and Canadian Major General Burns, who is the commander of the United Nations forces, in recent days. News has it that Wheeler and Burns have reached an agreement with the Anglo-French Task Force Command, agreeing to use Anglo-French naval salvage vessels and personnel in the canal clearing operation. According to this agreement, the Anglo-French naval salvage fleet will fly the United Nations flag, Anglo-French naval personnel will change into civilian clothes and wear United Nations armbands, and the United Nations forces will be responsible for protecting the safety of the Anglo-French naval salvage fleet. The collusion between Britain and France and the United States, under the guise of the United Nations, to achieve their goal of seizing the Suez Canal, is now completely exposed.
    The Anglo-French aggressors' conspiracy to delay withdrawal and collude with the United States under the banner of the United Nations to interfere in Egypt's canal clearing operation violates the successive resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly on the situation in Egypt. The United Nations General Assembly resolutions require the Anglo-French aggressors to withdraw their troops from Egypt immediately. The Anglo-French aggressors' actions to delay withdrawal are a blatant defiance of the United Nations General Assembly. At the same time, the United Nations General Assembly stipulates that the mission of the United Nations forces in Egypt is to supervise the ceasefire and supervise the withdrawal of the invading forces of Britain, France, and Israel. After the Anglo-French troops withdraw from Port Said, the United Nations forces should immediately leave the Suez Canal area. They cannot undertake any task of protecting the Anglo-French salvage fleet. The agreement reached between Wheeler and Burns and the Anglo-French Task Force Command is obviously completely illegal. Moreover, the Anglo-French naval salvage fleet is part of the Anglo-French invading army of Egypt. Allowing it to remain in the Suez Canal area under the banner of the United Nations and to be protected by the United Nations forces is a great irony to the United Nations and a great insult to the countries whose armies participate in the United Nations forces!
    Now, more and more facts prove that the Anglo-French announcement of withdrawal from Egypt does not mean that they have abandoned their aggression against Egypt and their intention to seize the Suez Canal. The Anglo-French were forced to announce their withdrawal only to ease the strong opposition at home and abroad caused by their aggression and to set a trap to induce Egypt to accept their "gradualist policy". All people who love peace and justice have a responsibility to resolutely oppose the Anglo-French aggressors' conspiracy to delay withdrawal, and have a responsibility to severely condemn the Anglo-French and American tricks of attempting to violate Egyptian sovereignty and seize the Suez Canal under the banner of the United Nations.

### 反对英法侵略者拖延撤军阴谋

    反对英法侵略者拖延撤军阴谋
    英法同美国勾结一起，企图利用联合国部队的名义来干涉埃及主权、占据苏伊士运河的阴谋，现在是越来越明显地暴露出来了。
    英法在宣布从埃及撤军以来的整个期间，一方面绝口不谈从塞得港撤退侵略军的最后期限，一方面却大喊大叫地要求立即进行苏伊士运河的清理工作，并且硬要埃及同意在清理运河工作中使用英法的海军打捞船队。它们企图把侵略埃及的一部分英法海军改头换面，作为清理运河的打捞船只和人员，继续留在苏伊士运河地区，以便实现它们夺取苏伊士运河的野心。
    现在，英法侵略者正对埃及使用空前残暴和卑鄙的压力，企图迫使埃及退让。劳埃德在12月3日宣布英法将从埃及“毫不拖延地撤退”它们的侵略军，到现在已经将近二十天，它们虽然撤走了一部分侵略军队，但仍留着一部分死赖在塞得港海边不肯撤走，并且还纵使它们的侵略士兵在塞得港继续大规模屠杀埃及人民，公开抢劫私人的住宅和商店。它们显然是在用拖延撤兵和野蛮屠杀来恫吓埃及，企图迫使埃及接受它们的撤军条件。
    同时，英法还对联合国“进行威胁”，企图通过联合国对埃及行使压力。它们甚至公然限定日期，要联合国逼迫埃及接受英法打捞船队，不然它们就要把已经打捞起来的船只再沉到运河底下去。英法侵略者同负责清理苏伊士运河工作的美国惠勒中将和担任联合国部队司令的加拿大伯恩斯少将之间，在这些日子里进行着频繁的接触和讨价还价。有消息说，惠勒和伯恩斯已经同英法特遣部队司令部达成了协议，同意在清理运河工作中使用英法海军的打捞船只和人员。根据这个协议，英法海军打捞船队将悬挂联合国的旗帜，英法海军人员将改穿便服和佩戴联合国臂章，而联合国部队则负责保护英法海军打捞船队的安全。英法正同打着联合国旗子的美国进行合谋，以实现它们夺取苏伊士运河的目的，现在已暴露得一清二楚的了。
    英法侵略者拖延撤军、并同美国勾结起来打着联合国旗子企图干涉埃及清理运河工作的阴谋活动，是违反联合国大会有关埃及局势的历次决议的。联合国大会决议要求英法侵略者立即从埃及撤军。英法侵略者拖延撤军的行动是对联合国大会的公开违抗。同时联合国大会规定联合国部队在埃及的任务，是监督停火和监督英法以三国侵略军队的撤退。联合国部队在英法军队从塞得港撤退之后，便应该立即离开苏伊士运河地区，它根本不能担任什么保护英法打捞船队的任务。惠勒和伯恩斯同英法特遣部队司令部之间所达成的协议，显然是完全非法的。而且，英法海军打捞船队是英法侵略埃及军队的一部分，让它打着联合国的旗帜继续留在苏伊士运河地区，并且得到联合国部队的保护，这是对联合国的极大讽刺，也是对有军队参加联合国部队的国家的莫大侮辱！
    现在，愈来愈多的事实证明，英法宣布从埃及撤军，并不表示它们已经放弃对埃及的侵略和夺取苏伊士运河的打算。英法被迫宣布撤军，只是为了和缓它们的侵略行动在国内外所引起的强烈反对情绪，并设下了一个诱使埃及接受它们的“渐进政策”的圈套。一切爱好和平和正义的人们，都有责任坚决反对英法侵略者拖延撤军的阴谋，都有责任严厉谴责英法美利用联合国旗子企图侵犯埃及主权、夺取苏伊士运河的诡计。
