    Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Welcome Ceremony of the Bombay Municipal Corporation
    Respected Mr. Mayor, dear friends:
    Thank you for the grand reception you have held for us. Thank you to the people of Bombay for the warm welcome they have repeatedly given us since our arrival in Bombay. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend my sincere respect and cordial greetings to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay and the people of Greater Bombay.
    Our two peoples have a deep and brotherly traditional friendship. Thousands of years ago, our ancestors crossed high mountains and ridges to develop close ties between our two countries. For thousands of years, our two countries have lived in peace and friendship. Although colonialist invasions once artificially severed our ties, our common goals of building our countries and safeguarding peace have given new impetus to our traditional friendship after we threw off the shackles of colonialism. The Himalayas did not prevent our ancestors from developing ties between our two countries, and today no force in the world can prevent us from further developing friendly cooperation between our two countries.
    Building our countries and safeguarding peace are not only the common goals of the Chinese and Indian peoples, but also the common aspirations of the Asian and African peoples. Two years ago, when I first visited your great country, Prime Minister Nehru and I put forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence – Panchsheel – in our joint statement. We established these five principles as the guiding principles for relations between our two countries, and we believe that these five principles should be applied to general international relations. We are convinced that only in this way can all countries in the world, especially Asian and African countries that have long suffered from the scourge of colonialism, fully and peacefully build their own countries; and only in this way can lasting world peace be achieved. Today, when colonialists are frantically launching attacks in the Asian and African regions, it is even more necessary for our two countries to hold high the banner of the Five Principles, unite the Asian and African peoples and all peace-loving forces in the world, and continue to work tirelessly to safeguard peace.
    Bombay is a city that the Indian people are proud of and that the Chinese people admire very much. Bombay has a glorious history in the Indian people's heroic struggle against colonialism. Today, Bombay is playing an important role as the Indian people work hard to build their own country. During our visit to Bombay these past two days, we have deeply realized that your city not only possesses a solid industrial base, but also has a rich cultural, artistic, and scientific and technological tradition. Such a solid foundation and excellent tradition will inevitably play a role in promoting national construction. Bombay has already played a significant role in your country's first five-year plan; undoubtedly, Bombay will continue to make important contributions in your country's second five-year plan.
    The Chinese people, like the Indian people, are also working hard to build their own country. In our construction work, our two peoples have many things to learn from each other, especially the Chinese people should learn from your advanced industrial construction experience and scientific and cultural achievements. I am very pleased to know that the Mayor of Tianjin, China, has invited your Mayor to visit Tianjin and other parts of China at the end of this month. I hope that the mayors of some Chinese cities will also be able to visit Bombay to learn from you. China should also have students come to your city for longer-term studies. There are many areas in which our two countries can exchange experiences, including economics, science, medicine, culture, and art. Bombay should become one of the central locations for Chinese people to come to India to study. Our ancestors once came to India at great pains to seek knowledge and wisdom, and today we should come here to learn from you with an open mind.
    The Chinese people also have particularly deep feelings for the city of Bombay. Because we remember that during the difficult days of our War of Resistance Against Japan, we received brotherly support from the Indian Medical Team, and among this medical team was Dr. Dwarkanath Kotnis, an outstanding son of Bombay. He gave his young life to support the Chinese people. The city of Bombay and the name of Dr. Kotnis will forever remain in the memory of the Chinese people.
    Mr. Mayor, friends, please allow me to thank you once again; let me congratulate the people of Greater Bombay on achieving even greater success in the cause of building their country and safeguarding peace!
    Hindi-Chini bhai bhai!
    Panchsheel Zindabad!

### 在孟买市市政机关欢迎会上  周恩来总理的讲话

    在孟买市市政机关欢迎会上
    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的市长先生，亲爱的朋友们：
    感谢你们为我们所举行的盛大招待会。感谢孟买市民在我们到达孟买以后一再给予我们的热情的欢迎。我以中国政府和中国人民的名义向大孟买市政府和大孟买市人民致诚挚的敬意和亲切的问候。
    我们两国人民有着深厚的、兄弟般的传统的友谊。几千年前，我们的祖先就越过了高山丛岭，发展了我们两国间密切的联系。几千年来，我们两国一直和平友好地相处。虽然殖民主义的入侵曾经一度人为地割断了我们之间的联系，但是当我们摆脱了殖民主义的束缚以后，我们建设祖国和保卫和平的共同目标更使我们的传统友谊获得了新的发展。喜马拉雅山并没有能够阻挡住我们的祖先发展我们两国之间的联系，今天世界上更没有任何力量阻挡得住我们进一步发展两国之间的友好合作。
    建设祖国和保卫和平不仅是中印两国人民的共同目标，而且也是亚非人民的一致愿望。两年以前，当我第一次访问你们伟大的国家的时候，尼赫鲁总理和我在我们的联合声明中提出了和平共处的五项原则——潘查希拉。我们把这五项原则确定为指导我们两国间关系的原则，我们并且认为，这五项原则应该适用于一般国际关系中。我们确信，只有这样，世界各国，特别是长期遭受殖民主义灾害的亚非国家，才有可能充分地和平建设自己的国家；也只有这样，才有可能获得持久的世界和平。今天，当殖民主义者正在亚非地区疯狂地进行进攻的时候，我们两国就更有必要高高地举起五项原则的旗帜，团结亚非人民和世界上一切爱好和平的力量，为保卫和平继续不懈地努力。
    孟买是印度人民值得自豪的一个城市，也是中国人民十分钦佩的一个城市。在印度人民反抗殖民主义的英勇斗争中，孟买有着光荣的历史。今天，当印度人民努力建设自己的国家的时候，孟买又起着重要的作用。两天来，我们在孟买的参观中，深深地体会到，你们的城市不仅拥有雄厚的工业基础，而且有着丰富的文化、艺术和科学技术的优良传统。这样的雄厚基础和优良传统必然会在全国的建设中起着推动的作用。在你们国家的第一个五年计划中，孟买已经起了很大的作用；无疑地，在你们国家的第二个五年计划中，孟买还将继续作出重要的贡献。
    中国人民，同印度人民一样，也正在努力进行自己祖国的建设。在建设工作中，我们两国人民有许多地方可以互相学习，特别是中国人民应该学习你们先进的工业建设经验和科学、文化的成就。我很高兴地知道，中国的天津市市长已经邀请了你们的市长先生在本月底到天津市和中国的其他地方去访问。我希望中国的一些城市的市长也能够到孟买来参观和访问，让他们多多向你们学习。中国还应该有留学生到你们的城市来进行比较长期的学习。我们两国之间可以交流经验的地方很多，包括经济、科学、医学、文化、艺术等各个方面。孟买应该成为中国人到印度来学习的中心地点之一。我们的祖先曾经不辞千辛万苦地来到印度寻求知识和智慧，我们今天更应该到你们这里来，虚心地向你们学习。
    中国人民对于孟买这个城市还特别具有深厚的感情。因为我们记得在我们抗日战争中的艰苦的日子里，我们曾经得到印度医疗队的兄弟般的支援，而在这医疗队中就有着孟买市的优秀的儿子柯棣华医生。为了支援中国人民，他献出了他年青的生命。孟买城市同柯棣华医生的名字永远留在中国人民的记忆中。
    市长先生，各位朋友们，请允许我再一次向你们致谢；让我祝贺大孟买市人民在建设祖国和保卫和平的事业中取得更大的成就！
    印地秦尼巴依巴依！
    潘查希拉秦达巴！
