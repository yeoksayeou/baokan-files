Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 24th: From January to December 20th this year, the units under the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee received more than 35,000 letters from the people and received more than 13,000 visitors. The number of letters and visits received has doubled compared with last year.

Many letters and visits from the masses raised demands regarding their lives and work. Some letters expressed opinions on the government's policies, and a large number of letters also exposed the bureaucratic work style and extravagance and waste of some departments and some cadres, and put forward many beneficial suggestions.

Most of the units have investigated and studied the problems raised in the people's letters and visits and have dealt with them or transferred them to relevant departments for study and handling. If a reply was needed, a reply was generally given. In March of this year, some cadres in Tangjia Township, Hanyuan County, were accused of having a coercive and commanding work style, and the accused cadres falsely accused the reporting masses of being an "anti-revolutionary group." After the Provincial People's Committee organized relevant departments to investigate the matter clearly based on many letters from the masses, it was properly handled, and the masses expressed great satisfaction.

    四川省人民委员会各部门
    加强处理人民来信工作
    新华社成都24日电　从今年1月到12月20日，四川省人民委员会所属各单位共接到人民来信三万五千多件，接受来访一万三千多人次。来信来访的数目都比去年多了一倍。
    许多群众来信来访提出了关于生活、工作方面的要求，有的来信表示了对政府政策的一些看法，还有很大一部分来信揭发了一些部门和一些干部的官僚主义作风和铺张浪费现象，并提出了许多有益的建议。
    各单位对人民来信来访中提出的问题，大多都经过调查研究以后进行了处理，或转给有关部门研究处理。需要答复的，一般也作了答复。今年3月间，汉源县唐家乡一些干部因为有强迫命令作风被一些人检举，被检举的干部就诬告检举的群众是“反革命集团”。这件事情经过省人民委员会根据许多群众来信组织有关部门调查清楚了，并进行了妥善处理，群众都表示很满意。
