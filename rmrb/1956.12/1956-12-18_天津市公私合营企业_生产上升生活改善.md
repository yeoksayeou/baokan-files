Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 16th: Tianjin's newly joint state-private enterprises have made significant progress in production and management over the past year. The total output value completed from January to November this year increased by 40% compared to the same period last year, reversing the downward trend in output value that had been occurring in the private sector since 1954. The output of the main products of these newly joint enterprises—steam boilers, air compressors, transformers, rubber wires, paint, nitric acid, fountain pens, and glucose, among others—has more than doubled this year compared to last year.

The electrical industry, which previously had scattered and outdated equipment and whose production could not meet the needs of the country, increased its output value by 88% from January to November this year compared to the same period last year after production reorganization. In the past, these factories could only produce some small electrical accessories. After the reorganization, they concentrated their technical strength and successfully researched and developed fifty-eight new products. Among them, twenty-one, including ultrasonic flaw detectors and hearing aids, are precision high-grade products.

Democratic management committees have been established in all new joint enterprises, and workers' working conditions and living welfare have also been improved. These improvements have boosted the enthusiasm of employees for production. For example, taking the labor productivity of the new joint enterprises in the first quarter of this year as 100, it increased to 127.7 in the second quarter and to 137.5 in the third quarter. After the production reorganization of the wool, flax, and silk industry, workers exchanged technical experiences with each other. Those who originally watched only one machine now watch two, and those who originally watched two now watch three or four. After the merger of seventeen small sewing machine repair shops and the North China Sewing Machine Factory, employees learned techniques from each other, increasing the number of sewing machine parts produced from forty-six to ninety-two.

These new joint enterprises have also made arrangements for the work of private personnel. By the end of the third quarter of this year, more than 4,500 people had been placed. Among them, twenty-nine are serving as managers or deputy managers of specialized companies, and four hundred and twenty-one are serving as factory directors or deputy factory directors. Private personnel who are still being placed or have not yet been placed continue to hold their original positions. After the enterprises became joint, they participated in socialist competitions alongside the employees. In the first three quarters of this year, a total of 1,386 people were selected as advanced producers or advanced workers. Some new joint enterprises have carried out renovations and expansions with relatively little expenditure. The output of the seven factories—machines, riveting, forging, etc.—that were the focus of the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Electrical and Mechanical Industries' expansion this year has more than doubled after the expansion compared to the past. The Tianjin Forging Machine Tool Factory, which previously could only produce ordinary machines such as water pumps, is now able to produce 400 kg air hammers and 300-ton liquid presses, becoming a factory specializing in the manufacture of medium-sized forging equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 16th: This year, on the basis of developing production, Tianjin's joint state-private enterprises have improved the living welfare and working conditions of their employees in various ways, according to needs and possibilities.

Many factories in the private sector had chaotic management and poor production, and the capitalists had long been in arrears with employees' wages. After the joint operation, the wages in arrears have mostly been paid back by the enterprises in installments. More than six hundred factories in the four districts of Jiangqiao, Nankai, etc., owed employees a total of more than 1.5 million yuan before the joint operation. By the end of November, the factories had successively repaid more than 1.2 million yuan. Some employees had borrowed money from the factory due to illness of themselves or their family members, and now the factory also exempts them from repayment based on the employee's economic situation. According to statistics from more than two hundred factories, employees had borrowed a total of more than 200,000 yuan in advance, and since the third quarter of this year, relevant departments have approved more than 180,000 yuan that does not need to be repaid. In addition, the trade union also provides appropriate subsidies to employees with particularly difficult living conditions. Joint state-private factories in the four districts of Chengxiang, Hebei, etc., subsidized more than 3,000 people a total of more than 100,000 yuan from January to September this year. After the winter, many factories conducted a physical subsidy for employees who could not afford to add cotton clothes and quilts.

Starting from the second quarter of this year, a general safety inspection was carried out in all new joint factories in Tianjin. Many factories have improved the equipment of boilers, electrical appliances, and punch presses, and installed safety covers on the machines. In summer, many factories have installed ventilation and heat insulation equipment or opened more windows to lower the temperature in the workshop. In the new joint factories in Hebei and Hongqiao districts alone, more than 530,000 yuan was spent this year to improve safety equipment and cooling equipment.

The labor insurance benefits and medical treatment for diseases of employees in the new joint factories have also been improved. The Regulations on Labor Insurance were implemented in the new joint factories in October this year. Factories in Chengxiang, Hebei, and Hongqiao districts have also established more than sixty nurseries and daycare rooms. Factories in the cotton textile and hardware industries in Hongqiao District have adjusted employee housing by using vacant rooms and repairing dangerous houses.

    天津市公私合营企业
    生产上升生活改善
    据新华社天津16日电　天津市新合营企业一年来在生产和管理方面有飞跃的进步。今年1月到11月完成的总产值比去年同期增长了40％，扭转了在私营时期从1954年以来产值逐渐下降的趋势。这些新合营企业生产的主要产品——蒸气锅炉、空气压缩机、变压器、橡皮线、油漆、硝酸、钢笔和葡萄糖等，今年产量都比去年增长了一倍以上。
    原来设备分散、落后，生产不能满足国家需要的电器工业，经过生产改组，今年1月到11月的产值比去年同期增加了88％。过去这些工厂只能生产一些小型的电器配件，改组后集中了技术力量，研究成功了五十八种新产品。其中超声波探伤器、耳聋助听器等二十一种都是精密的高级产品。
    各个新合营企业都建立了民主管理委员会，工人的劳动条件和生活福利待遇也有了改善。这些都鼓舞了职工的生产热情。如以今年第一季新合营企业的劳动生产率为一百，第二季度增加到一百二十七点七，第三季度增加到一百三十七点五。毛麻丝工业生产改组后，工人互相交流技术经验，原来只看一台机器的现在看两台，原来看两台的现在看三、四台。十七个小型缝纫机修配厂和华北缝纫机厂合并后，职工互相学习技术，使生产的缝纫机零件由四十六种增加到九十二种。
    这些新合营企业对私方人员的工作也做了安排。到今年第三季度末，已经安排了四千五百多人。其中有二十九人担任专业公司的经理、副经理，有四百二十一人担任厂长、副厂长。正在安排或还没有安排的私方人员，现在仍继续担任原来的职务。在企业合营后，他们和职工一道参加了社会主义竞赛，在今年的前三个季度总计有一千三百八十六人被评选为先进生产者或先进工作者。有些新合营企业，在花钱不多的情况下进行了改建、扩建。天津市机电工业局今年重点扩建的机器、铆造、锻压等七个工厂，扩建后的产量都比过去提高两倍以上。天津市锻压机床厂原来只能生产水泵等普通机器，现在已能生产四百公斤的空气锤和三百公吨的液体压力机，成为专门制造中型锻压设备的工厂。
    新华社天津16日电　天津市公私合营企业今年在发展生产的基础上，根据需要和可能，从各方面改善了职工的生活福利和劳动条件。
    许多工厂在私营时期因管理混乱、生产不好，资方长期拖欠职工工资。合营以后，拖欠的工资已大部分由企业分期发还。江桥、南开等四个区六百多个工厂在合营前共欠职工工资一百五十多万元，到11月底各厂已陆续发还了一百二十多万元。有些职工因本人或家属患病曾向工厂借了钱，现在工厂也根据职工的经济情况，分别免予归还。据二百多个工厂的统计，职工过去共借支二十多万元，从今年第三季度起有关部门已批准十八万多元不必归还。此外，工会对生活有特别困难的职工还给予适当的补助。城厢、河北等四个区的公私合营工厂，今年1月份到9月份共补助了三千多人次，用款十万多元。入冬以后，许多工厂又对无力添置棉衣、棉被的职工进行了一次实物补助。
    从今年第二季度开始，天津全市新合营工厂普遍进行了一次安全大检查。许多工厂改进了锅炉、电器和冲床的设备，在机器上装了安全罩。在夏天，许多工厂都装了通风、隔热设备或增开窗户，降低车间温度。仅河北、红桥两个区的新合营工厂，今年用于改善安全设备和降温设备的费用就有五十三万多元。
    新合营工厂职工的劳动保险待遇和疾病医疗方面也都有改善。今年10月份在新合营工厂中实行了劳动保险条例。城厢、河北、红桥区的工厂还建立了六十多个托儿所和托儿间。红桥区棉织、五金等行业的工厂采取利用空房、修理危险房屋的办法，调整了职工住房。
