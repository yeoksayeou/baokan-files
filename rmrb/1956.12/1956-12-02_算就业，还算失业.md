Counting Employment, or Counting Unemployment
Gao Zhi

General unemployment means that people with the ability to work have no work to do and no wages to earn. If they have wages to earn, they cannot be considered unemployed.

But from the perspective of "employment," even for personnel in state organs, if they have the ability to work but no work to do, have expertise but no place to use it, although they have wages to earn, I think they should still be considered unemployed. This kind of idleness with wages, unemployment that is not counted as unemployment, can only be tentatively called special unemployment.

There are two kinds of special unemployment.

The first is unemployment within the profession, unemployment within the specialty. Some people, nominally engaged in their profession, are actually doing nothing. These people cannot be regarded as redundant personnel. Because it is not that the country has no work waiting for them to do, nor that they themselves cannot do it or are unwilling to do it.

The First and Third Bureaus of the First Ministry of Machine Building Design Bureau each have dozens of translators, but sometimes half of them are idle for a whole year, sometimes "all unemployed" for eight months (see People's Daily, September 9).

Many people being "unemployed" for a year and a half is not uncommon. There are even those "unemployed" for seven years. There are many excellent directors and actors in the Shanghai Film Studio. But there are many directors who do not make a film for two or three years, and many actors who do not shoot a scene for seven years! At the same time, the people of the whole country need more films!

Who is responsible for the fact that artists have no artistic practice for seven years?

The second type is unemployment outside the profession. Some people are employed in work outside their profession, but unemployed in work within their profession. The question is not: can a person change careers when it is really necessary; but: should many people be asked to abandon their profession and expertise when it is not necessary?

Some college graduates received education to consolidate their professional thinking when they entered school, but were "mobilized" to change careers when they were employed. May I ask, if they are now graduating and using what they did not study, why bother studying that major in the first place, wasting their youth in vain? In fact, the country needs them to engage in their profession.

Some older experts are also in this situation. At the beginning of this year, in the five units of a central ministry, about 10% of the experts could not use what they had learned. In September, when five central departments jointly recruited experts, schools would not let go of those who were not suitable for being professors, and even hindered them from applying; while organs would not let go of those who were suitable for research and teaching work. As for the old artists being "taken care of" by being transferred to railway work and abandoning artistic practice, that is even more a loss of "employment."

However, these phenomena will definitely change and improve. Negative forces are all being transformed into positive forces, let alone that they were originally positive forces.

Please look at the care of the Party and the government: Lü Tongyou, a porter in Xinqiao, Jiangdu County, became a doctor in a hospital (see People's Daily, April 13), Shang Yanliu, an 83-year-old "Tanhua" from Nanjing, is writing "A Description of the Qing Dynasty Imperial Examination" (see People's Daily, August 2), and Cantonese opera artist Bai Juyi, who stopped performing for ten years after going blind, has restored his artistic life. There are many such examples. The temporarily "unemployed" experts and artists will definitely be able to make the best use of their talents and show the superiority of socialism ten thousand times more.

The Party and the government will definitely make every useful person truly useful and even more useful.

    算就业，还算失业
    高植
    一般的失业，是有工作能力的人没有工作可做，没有工资可拿。有工资可拿，就不能算是失业了。
    但是从“业”上来看，即使身为国家机关的人员，有工作能力而无工作可做，有专长而无用武之地，虽有工资可拿，我认为也还算得是失业。这种有工资的赋闲，不算失业的失业，只好姑且叫作特种的失业了。
    有两种特种的失业。
    第一种是本行以内的失业，专业以内的失业。有些人，说起来是在搞本行的工作，实际上却什么也不在搞。这些人是不能作为冗员看待的。因为并不是国家没有工作正等着他们去做，也不是他们自己不能做，不愿做。
    第一机械工业部设计总局第一和第三分局，各有几十个翻译，却有时一半的人闲一整年，有时“全体失业”八个月（见9月9日人民日报）。
    许多人“失业”一年半载，不算稀奇。还有“失业”七年的。上海电影制片厂里有许多优秀的导演和演员。但是有许多导演两三年不拍一部戏，有许多演员七年不拍一个镜头！而同时，全国人民正需要更多的影片！
    艺术家七年没有艺术实践，责任在谁呢？
    第二种是本行以外的失业。有些人，在外行工作上是就业了，在本行的工作上却失业了。问题不是：在真必要的时候，一个人能不能改行；而是：在不必要的时候，应该不应该叫许多人放弃他们的本行和专长。
    有些高等学校毕业生，入学时受了巩固专业思想的教育，就业时却又被“动员”改行。请问，现在毕了业用非所学，当初何必学那一专业，白白浪费了青春呢？而实际上，国家正需要他们去搞他们的专业。
    有些年纪较大的专家也有这种情况。今年年初，中央某部的五个单位里，约有10％的专家不能用其所学。9月间，中央五个部门联合招聘专家时，不宜于做教授的，学校不放，甚至阻挠应聘；而宜于从事研究和教学工作的，机关也不放。至于老艺人被“照顾”到铁路工作上去脱离艺术实践，那更是失“业”了。
    不过这些现象一定会改变而且好转的。消极的力量都正在化为积极的力量，何况他们本来就是积极的力量呢。
    请看党和政府的关怀吧：江都县新乔的搬运工人吕同友做了医院的医生（见4月13日人民日报），南京八十三岁的“探花”商衍鎏在写“清代科举考试述录”（见8月2日人民日报），失明后停演十年的粤剧艺人白驹荣恢复了他的艺术生命。这类的事例有的是。暂时失“业”的专家们，艺术家们，一定能够人尽其才，更能千万倍地表现出社会主义的优越性。
    党和政府一定会使每个有用的人真有用，更有用。
