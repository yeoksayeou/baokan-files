A big ox is worth nine yuan,
    An arrogant person isn't worth nine cents.
    Unable to see the camel on one's own head,
    One can see a fine needle on another's head.
    An ant crawls onto the tip of an ox's horn,
    And happily says: I've climbed a high mountain.
    Rice stuck to one's mustache,
    It's difficult to eat one's fill.
    Weeping with sorrow,
    Is not as good as clenching your fist.

    一个自大不值九分钱
    （蒙古谚语）
    一头大牛能值九块钱，
    一个自大不值九分钱。
    看不清自己头上的骆驼，
    能看清别人头上的细针。
    蚂蚁爬上了牛角尖，
    高兴地说：我爬上了高山。
    粘在胡子上的饭，
    要想吃饱难上难。
    泣泪悲愁，
    不如揑紧拳头。
                郝苏民辑译
