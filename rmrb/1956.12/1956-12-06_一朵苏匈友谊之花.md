　　A Flower of Soviet-Hungarian Friendship
　　Fang Lei
    The Hungarian poet Szamió György had come to China. Suddenly, unrest broke out in Hungary. This news made people all over the world uneasy and angry, especially Szamió, who was far away from his homeland. Throughout his journey, he was strongly concerned about his country and his family.
    Chinese comrades comforted him, shared his worries, and did everything they could to help him get news from his country and family. But the news was slow in coming.
    In Shanghai, the poet happened to meet the Soviet writer Polevoy. This enthusiastic Soviet immediately inquired about the poet's country and family. At this time, the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government had just been established, and the domestic situation had basically stabilized, but the poet had not yet received news from his mother and wife living in Budapest. Polevoy said, "I will call my wife today and ask her to make a long-distance call from Moscow to your wife. Women often talk more effectively than diplomats!"
    After this meeting, the poet left Shanghai and returned to Beijing. As soon as he stepped off the train, the Chinese comrades who greeted him reported good news to him: Polevoy had called from Shanghai, and his wife had already spoken with the poet's wife on the phone. The poet's whole family was safe. The poet was so excited that he couldn't speak, he just kept repeating, "Polevoy is so good!"
    The next day, he received another express telegram from Shanghai, in which Polevoy told him: "Your whole family is well, and your wife wants you to have a good trip in China." The poet wanted to send a telegram to thank him, but Polevoy had already left Shanghai.
    Soon, Polevoy returned to Beijing. The poet went to find him. As he reached the elevator entrance, Polevoy came out of the elevator. The poet rushed up, and the two embraced each other, shouting. Polevoy pulled the poet back into the elevator to find a Russian translator comrade.
    The enthusiasm was not diminished by the language barrier. The poet said, "I am very, very grateful to you. You are the first person to give me news about my family. I will always remember this." Polevoy said enthusiastically, "I am really happy for you, now you can relax. I am an old soldier, so I advise you to stay in China for a few more days, your wife also hopes so!"
    At this time, Chinese comrades crowded around, although they didn't understand the language, everyone showed a face of excited brilliance, congratulating this flower of Soviet-Hungarian friendship blooming on Chinese soil.

　　一朵苏匈友谊之花
　　方蕾
    匈牙利诗人萨米奥·乔治月前来到了中国。忽然，匈牙利国内起了变乱。这消息使全世界人民不安和愤怒，更何况远离祖国的萨米奥。他在整个旅途中，强烈地惦念着祖国，惦念着家。
    中国同志安慰他、分担他的忧愁，并用一切力量帮助他得到祖国和家庭的消息。可是消息迟迟不来。
    在上海，诗人偶然同苏联作家波列伏依相遇了。这热诚的苏维埃人立刻打听诗人的祖国和家庭的消息。这时，匈牙利工农革命政府刚刚成立，国内情况基本平定下来了，可是诗人还没能得到住在布达佩斯的妈妈和妻子的消息。波列伏依说：“我今天就打电话给我的妻子，让她从莫斯科打个长途电话给你的妻子。女人们谈话往往比外交官要行得多啊！”
    这次碰面后，诗人离开上海回北京了。他一脚跨下火车，迎接他的中国同志报告给他一个好消息：波列伏依从上海打来了电话，他的妻子已经同诗人的妻子在电话中谈过话，诗人的全家平安。诗人激动得说不出话来，他只重复着：“波列伏依真好！”
    第二天，他又收到上海拍来的加急电报，波列伏依在电报中又告诉他：“你全家安好，你的夫人愿意你在中国好好地旅行。”诗人当时要回电报感谢，但是波列伏依已经离开了上海。
    不久，波列伏依回到北京。诗人去找他。刚到电梯门口，波列伏依走出了电梯。诗人扑上去，两人相抱在一起，嘴里直嚷嚷。波列伏依拉着诗人重新走进电梯，再去找个俄文翻译同志来。
    热情不曾因语言的阻隔而减弱丝毫。诗人说：“我非常非常感谢你，你是第一个给我家庭消息的人，我将永远记着这件事。”波列伏依热情地说：“我真替你高兴，现在你可以安心了。我是一个老兵，因此我劝你在中国再多呆几天，你的夫人也这么希望呢！
    这时周围挤满了中国同志，虽然语言不通，但是个个露出一脸的兴奋光辉，祝贺这一朵开在中国土地上的苏匈友谊之花。
