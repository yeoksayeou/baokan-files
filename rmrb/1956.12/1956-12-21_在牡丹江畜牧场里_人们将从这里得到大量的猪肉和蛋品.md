    At the Mudanjiang Livestock Farm
    ——People Will Obtain Large Quantities of Pork and Eggs From Here...
    By Our Correspondent Lin Xi
    In Mudanjiang City, Heilongjiang Province, it is already the severe cold season of thirty degrees below zero. People here can still eat fresh large eggs.
    On December 9th, I accompanied the person in charge of the Ministry of Land Reclamation by car through patches of white birch forest in the northwest suburbs of Mudanjiang City and arrived at the Mudanjiang Livestock Farm. The fresh eggs are produced here. This livestock farm was originally a military horse farm belonging to the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In 1956, it was transferred to the management of the Ministry of Land Reclamation. In addition to continuing to cultivate fine horses, the scope of operation was expanded to include a pig farm and an enlarged chicken farm.
    The headquarters of the livestock farm is located in a gently sloping hilly area. It has a large number of white and red livestock houses in front and behind it, and groups of chickens, pigs, and horses live inside.
    The chicken farm has more than 15,000 Leghorn chickens, managed by a dozen breeders. A large room about forty or fifty meters long and ten meters wide is divided into two parts: a corridor for the breeders to work in and a place for the chickens to live. The sunny side is fitted with bright large glass windows, so that the chickens can get plenty of sunlight. There is also a stove in the corridor, so the chicken house is always kept at a certain temperature.
    Each breeder is responsible for feeding an average of 1,500 chickens. In addition to feeding regularly and adjusting the indoor temperature, they also have to clean the chicken coop every day to prevent chicken diseases. In the past few years, not a single chicken has died in this chicken farm, and the number of chickens raised has increased year by year. Thanks to good feeding and management, the egg production rate has been increasing year by year. Even in these severe cold days of thirty degrees below zero, the egg production rate reaches 70%. A comrade who accompanied me on the tour pointed to a newly built house and said: "A large chicken house has been built there, and it is planned to hatch 50,000 chickens in February next year."
    I walked into two tall stables. They were warm and clean inside. In order to prevent infectious diseases, everyone who enters the stable must dip the soles of their shoes in a pile of lime and medicine at the gate for disinfection. There are many precious studs produced in our country here. In the past, these horses were mostly used to cultivate military horses; now, our country's experts use these studs to crossbreed with domestic horses and have cultivated good horses suitable for agriculture and transportation in our country. This kind of horse has a pulling force of 2,000 kilograms, and the nearby farmers think the quality is very good. Now, preparations are being made to greatly increase the number of these horses for the agricultural production cooperatives in a dozen counties in the Mudanjiang area.
    I only stayed in the stable for a short time. However, the feeders' feelings for the horses they raise left a very deep impression on me. They carefully scrubbed the horses' bodies and prepared the feed; one feeder said that in order to keep the horses in good physical condition, they had to lead the horses to graze in the wild in the freezing weather.
    Here, 10,000 square meters of new houses have been built, and 500 sows will be transported here. Within next year, 5,000 piglets will be bred here.
    The livestock farm opened a breeder training class in the autumn of this year, and there are now 300 young men and women studying here. They are all junior high school or higher primary school students, many of whom are from southern provinces. When they first came, many of them disliked getting dirty; later, this idea was quickly reversed. The person in charge of the Ministry of Land Reclamation and some students talked about the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on increasing production and practicing economy, and mentioned that the Party Central Committee is very concerned about the people eating meat and eggs. These words encouraged the young men and women. I spoke with one student, and she really had grand ideals and interests in animal husbandry. She said: "When I see the farm being able to produce boxes and carts of eggs for the country every day, I am extremely happy!"
    The Mudanjiang Livestock Farm is a farm with broad development prospects. Behind the existing site, there are tens of thousands of hectares of fertile grassland, with large and small rivers running through it, making it convenient for livestock to graze and drink water. Adjacent to the north of the grassland is a forest, so there will be sufficient timber for the construction of livestock houses; the transportation here is convenient, and there is no problem with product sales. In 1957, demobilized and transferred soldiers of the Railway Corps will reclaim 3,000 hectares of land here, and the feed for tens of thousands of livestock can be completely solved locally.
    Without having to wait a long time, urban people will be able to obtain large quantities of pork and eggs from here, and farmers will obtain more high-quality draft animals from here.

    在牡丹江畜牧场里
    ——人们将从这里得到大量的猪肉和蛋品……
    本报记者　林晰
    在黑龙江省牡丹江市，已经是零下三十度的严寒季节。人们在这里还可以吃到新鲜的大鸡蛋。
    12月9日，我随同农垦部负责人乘汽车通过牡丹江市西北郊一片片的白桦树林，来到了牡丹江畜牧场。新鲜的鸡蛋就出产在这里。这座畜牧场原来是中国人民解放军总后勤部所属的一个军马场，1956年转为农垦部经营，经营的范围除了继续培殖良马以外，还添设了养猪场和扩大了养鸡场。
    畜牧场场部设在坡度不大的丘陵地带上，它的前前后后拥有大批白色和红色的牲畜房舍，成群的鸡、猪和马匹就生活在这里面。
    鸡场里有莱克亨种鸡一万五千多只，由十几名饲养员负责管理。一间长约四、五十公尺宽十来公尺的大房间，被分割成两个部分：饲养员进行工作的走廊和鸡住的地方。朝阳的一边装有明亮的大玻璃窗，鸡可以受到充分阳光的照射。走廊里还生着火炉，鸡舍里经常保持着一定的温度。
    饲养员平均每个人要负责喂养一千五百只鸡。他们除了定时喂养，调剂室内温度以外，每天还要打扫鸡舍，防止鸡病。几年来，这个鸡场没有死掉一只鸡，而且喂养的数量一年比一年增多。由于喂养管理得好，产蛋率逐年提高。即使在这零下三十度的严寒的日子，产蛋率也达到70％。陪同我参观的一个同志指着一片新建的房子说：“那里已经盖起了大片鸡舍，计划在明年2月里孵化五万只鸡。”
    我走进了两所高大的马厩。里面温暖而整洁。为了防止传染病，凡是走进马厩的人，都要在大门口把自己的鞋底投在石灰堆和药水里消毒。这里有很多国家出产的名贵种马。这些马过去多是培殖军用马匹用的；现在，我国专家利用这些种马和国产马杂交，已经培育出来适于我国农业和运输业使用的好马。这种马挽力达到二千公斤，附近农民认为质量很好。现在，正准备为牡丹江专区十几个县的农业生产合作社大量增殖这种马匹。
    在马厩里，我只停留了很短的时间。可是，饲养员对自己喂养的马的感情，给人以极深刻的印象。他们细心地为马匹洗刷身体，调配饲料；一位饲养员说，为了保持马匹有充沛的体力，他们要在冰天雪地里，带领马队到野外去放牧。
    在这里，一万平方公尺的新房舍已经建成，五百头母猪将要运来。明年一年内，这里将繁殖五千头仔猪。
    畜牧场在今年秋季开办了一个饲养员训练班，现在有三百名男女青年在这里学习。他们都是初中或高小程度的学生，其中不少人是从南方各省来的。他们才来的时候，有不少人嫌脏；以后这种思想很快就扭转过来了。农垦部的负责同志和一些学员谈到了中共中央二中全会关于增产节约的精神，并且提到了党中央十分关心人民吃肉和吃鸡蛋的事。这些话鼓舞了小伙子和姑娘们。我同一个学员谈过话，她对畜牧事业确实有着宏大的理想和兴趣。她说：“等我看到场里每天能够为国家生产成箱成车的鸡蛋的时候，我真高兴极了！”
    牡丹江畜牧场是一个有着广阔发展前途的牧场。在现有场址的背后，有成万公顷的肥沃草原，草原上有大大小小的河流贯穿其间，牲畜吃草、饮水都很方便。紧挨草原的北面是一片森林，牲畜房舍的修建将有充足的木材；这里交通方便，产品销售不成问题。1957年，铁道兵的复员转业军人将在这里开垦三千公顷土地，成千上万头牲畜饲料完全可以在当地解决。
    用不着等待很长的时间，城市人民将可以从这里得到大量的猪肉和蛋品，农民将从这里得到更多品质优良的耕畜。
