    Reporting on Grassroots Sports Activities
    We greatly enjoy the sports news column in the People's Daily. However, I feel that there is too little coverage of sports activities in factories, mines, construction sites, and government offices, which weakens the guidance for grassroots sports activities. If the People's Daily could appropriately report on experiences in this area and raise related issues, it would play a significant role in guiding and assisting the development of grassroots sports activities throughout the country.

    报道基层体育活动
    人民日报的体育新闻专栏，我们很喜爱。但我觉得报道厂矿、工地、机关的体育活动很少，这就削弱了对基层体育活动的指导。如果人民日报能适当报道这方面的经验，提出这方面的问题，对指导与帮助全国各地基层体育活动的开展将起一定作用。
