Xinhua News Agency, 7th — Egyptian Ambassador to China, Ragab, told reporters today that unless Egypt receives fair compensation for the damage it suffered due to the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel, there is little hope for resolving the complex Middle East issues that have been further complicated by this aggression.

　　He said at a press conference here this morning: "If unscrupulous aggressors are allowed to carry out aggression without any punishment, then the security of the world will be seriously threatened."

　　The Egyptian ambassador said that if Britain and France do not offer compensation to Egypt, then "our world will return to the law of the jungle. Allowing such a thing to happen would pose a serious threat to our moral standards."

　　He said that his country is not currently demanding an apology from the governments of the aggressor nations, as these governments have already "proven, when they launched a brutal attack on the innocent people of Egypt, that they attach little importance to human values."

　　Ambassador Ragab said that the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt was a "premeditated conspiracy," launched at a time when negotiations on resolving the Suez Canal dispute were proceeding satisfactorily according to the decisions of the United Nations Security Council.

　　He emphasized: "It is a serious flaw in the history of the United Nations that two countries, as founding members of the United Nations and permanent members of the Security Council, actually instigated and participated in an unscrupulous attack that violated the basic principles of the United Nations and flagrantly disregarded the wishes expressed by the Security Council."

　　He said that Britain and France, "together with Israel, attacked Egypt, ignited the flames of war in the Middle East, and brought the whole world to the brink of war."

　　Ambassador Ragab thanked China for its "timely and enthusiastic support, which Egypt has consistently felt in its struggle against imperialist aggression."

　　埃及驻华大使在记者招待会上强调指出
　　英法以三国必须赔偿埃及损失
    新华社7日讯　埃及驻中国大使拉加卜今天对新闻记者说，除非是埃及由于英国、法国和以色列进行侵略而遭受的损害获得公正的赔偿，否则，由于这种侵略而更加复杂起来的复杂的中东问题就难有解决的希望。
    他今天上午在这里的一次记者招待会上说：“如果让不讲信义的侵略者进行了侵略而不受任何惩罚，那末世界的安全就要受到严重的威胁。”
    埃及大使说：如果英法两国不向埃及提出补偿，那么“我们的世界就要重新回到弱肉强食的法律之下。容许这样的事就会使我们的道德标准遭受严重的威胁”。
    他说，他的国家目前并不要求侵略国政府道歉，这些国家的政府已经“证明，当它们向无辜的埃及人民发动惨无人道的攻击的时候，它们是很不重视人类的价值的”。
    拉加卜大使说：英、法、以三国对埃及的侵略是“事先策划的阴谋”，它是在关于解决苏伊士运河争端的商谈正在根据联合国安全理事会的决定而进行得令人满意的时候发动的。
    他着重地指出：“作为联合国的发起国和安全理事会常任理事国的两个国家，居然鼓动并参加了一种违背联合国组织的基本原则，而且悍然背弃安全理事会所表明的愿望而发动的一种不讲信义的进攻，这实在是联合国历史上一个严重的缺陷。”
    他说：英法两国“同以色列一道进攻埃及，挑起了中东的战火，使全世界临到战争的边缘”。
    拉加卜大使感谢中国的“及时而热情的支援，埃及在反对帝国主义侵略的斗争中经常感受到中国的这种支援”。
