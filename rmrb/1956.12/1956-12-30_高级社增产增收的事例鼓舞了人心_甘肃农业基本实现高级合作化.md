Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 28th: Gansu Province has basically achieved advanced agricultural cooperativization. Currently, the province has established more than 13,900 advanced agricultural production cooperatives, with farmer households participating accounting for 86.09% of the total number of farmer households.

Currently, regions in Gansu Province that have completed the transition to advanced cooperatives are carrying out cooperative consolidation and winter production work. The content of the consolidation primarily involves resolving outstanding issues from the transition, improving operational management, and further implementing the spirit of democratic and thrifty cooperative management.

Gansu Province achieved elementary cooperativization by the end of last year. Before the spring plowing this year, farmer households participating in advanced cooperatives only accounted for 22.83% of the total number of farmer households, and only the Yinchuan Special District and the suburbs of Lanzhou City had achieved advanced cooperativization. Since the spring plowing, Party organizations at all levels throughout the province have carried out consolidation work on tens of thousands of elementary cooperatives, and have systematically helped these cooperatives transition to advanced cooperatives in batches after the summer and autumn harvests. Currently, with the exception of some counties in individual special districts that are still undergoing the transition, the number of farmer households joining advanced cooperatives in the Yinchuan, Pingliang, Dingxi, Zhangye, and Wudu Special Districts, as well as the Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, is above 90%. The number of farmer households joining advanced cooperatives in the Wu Zhong and Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefectures has also reached 79.69% and 86.95% respectively. Currently, the advanced cooperatives throughout the province average about 130 households per cooperative, with the largest cooperative having more than 1,600 households.

This year, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives in Gansu Province have achieved increased production, and the income of most members has increased compared to last year. Over 90% of the advanced cooperatives in the Yinchuan Special District have achieved increased production, and 88% of the members have increased their income. These instances have prompted members of elementary cooperatives to actively demand to transition to advanced cooperatives. At the same time, this year, various localities have carried out a series of tasks before and during the transition, such as summarizing the experiences of local advanced cooperatives, organizing members of elementary cooperatives to visit advanced cooperatives, and correcting the phenomenon of underestimating the price of livestock and other means of production when they are contributed to the cooperatives. This is also an important reason why most regions have smoothly completed the transition work.

    高级社增产增收的事例鼓舞了人心
    甘肃农业基本实现高级合作化
    新华社兰州28日电　甘肃省农业基本上实现了高级合作化。现在全省已经建成高级农业生产合作社一万三千九百多个，入社农户占农户总数86.09％。
    目前，甘肃省已经完成转高级社的地区正在进行整社和冬季生产工作。整社内容主要是处理转社的遗留问题、改善经营管理和进一步贯彻民主办社、勤俭办社的精神。
    甘肃省是去年年底实现初级合作化的。今年春耕前，全省参加高级社的农户只占农户总数22.83％，实现高级合作化的地区仅有银川专区和兰州市郊区。春耕以来，全省各级党的组织就对几万个初级社进行了整顿巩固工作，并在夏收和秋收后有计划地帮助这些社分批转为高级社。现在除个别专区的部分县正在转社外，银川、平凉、定西、张掖、武都等专区和临夏回族自治州加入高级社的农户都在90％以上，吴忠和固原两个回族自治州加入高级社的农户也分别达到79.69％和86.95％。目前，全省的高级社平均每个社有一百三十户左右，户数最多的社有一千六百多户。
    今年甘肃省绝大部分农业社都获得增产，大多数社员收入比去年增加。银川专区有90％以上的高级社得到了增产，有88％的社员增加了收入，这些事例促使初级社社员积极要求转入高级社。同时，今年各地在转社前和转社中做了一系列工作，如总结当地高级社的经验，组织初级社社员到高级社参观访问，纠正了对牲畜和其他生产资料折价入社偏低现象等，这也是使大部分地区顺利完成转社工作的重要原因。
