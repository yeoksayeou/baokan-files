Our Cooperative Plans to Raise 20,000 Pigs
Song Bao'en, Director of Shimen Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, Yanggu County, Shandong Province

Last Year (1955): One Pig per Person, 1,000 Jin per Mu

Our cooperative was established in 1952 with seventeen households. Now, it has two thousand seven hundred and forty households. In terms of output, in 1952, the average yield per mu was seven hundred and twenty jin. By 1954, the average yield had reached nine hundred and sixty jin. Last year (1955), the average yield per mu was one thousand and nine jin. Why has the output increased year after year? Of course, there are many reasons, but it is related to the large number of pigs raised in the cooperative. In August of last year (1955), a total of three hundred and eight pigs were raised. At that time, it was calculated that there was an average of five pigs per household, one pig per person, and one pig for every two mu and two fen of land. More pigs mean more manure, and more manure in the fields leads to higher yields. As soon as the cooperative expanded, because many new members originally raised fewer pigs, the entire cooperative only raised four thousand one hundred and ten pigs. The plan for this year (1956) is to raise 20,000 pigs.

Why Did Pig Farming Lose Money in the Year Before Last (1953)?

Our cooperative started raising pigs in 1953. At that time, only seventy-five pigs were raised, and they were not raised well. Why? Because some well-to-do middle peasants joined the cooperative and stopped raising pigs. They thought raising pigs was troublesome, and they disliked the effort of hauling soil and accumulating manure, believing that chemical fertilizers were better. At that time, the management committee was influenced by the well-to-do middle peasants and relaxed their leadership over pig farming. There was no fixed person in charge of raising pigs; it was all left to the elderly. They didn't use new techniques in raising pigs, and they fed the pigs a lot of bean cake, but they were raised poorly. A total of seventy-five pigs were raised, each pig ate three hundred jin of bean cake, which was a great waste. Because no attention was paid to disease prevention, about thirty pigs died. As a result, not only was no money made, but each pig lost more than two yuan. That year, fewer pigs were raised, less manure was accumulated, and more chemical fertilizers and manure were used, averaging eleven to twelve yuan per mu, totaling six thousand yuan for the whole year. With such high costs, although the output increased somewhat, the members could not increase their income, and everyone was dissatisfied. Poor peasant members criticized us for only listening to the well-to-do middle peasants and not acting according to the demands of the poor peasants. In 1954, the management committee was determined to correct this mistake from the previous year. Three cooperative members who considered the cooperative their home were selected as breeders, two were members of the Communist Youth League, and one was a Party member; they were given reasonable work points. A pig-raising and manure-collecting committee was also established, with me as the chairman; and it was stipulated that pig-raising work should also be checked during the inspection of production plans, and those who completed the plan should be commended, and those who did not complete the plan should be criticized.

People Who Were Not Active in Raising Pigs Became Active

That year, the plan was to raise one hundred and forty pigs. In order to encourage members to raise pigs themselves, the management committee analyzed the three situations of the members: poor members without labor power were happy to raise pigs, but could not afford piglets or feed; some members with a good life were "sitting on two boats" and could not make up their minds; and some members were unwilling to raise pigs because the price of manure had not been determined. Based on this analysis, in order to support poor members in raising pigs, the cooperative used money to buy piglets and lend them to them. When they weighed seventy or eighty jin, the pigs needed to eat grain, which they could not afford, so they sold them to the cooperative at the price stipulated by the food company. This method was not disadvantageous to either the cooperative or the members, and more pigs were raised. There was a household of two people, both in their seventies. The cooperative lent them two piglets, and when they grew to seventy or eighty jin, they sold one to the cooperative and took the money back to buy bean cake to feed the other pig. This solved their difficulties. One household of two people, both over seventy years old, the cooperative lent them two piglets, and they earned twenty-eight yuan in a year and accumulated more than ten carts of manure to hand over to the cooperative, earning three hundred jin of grain. They also did some light work and earned three hundred jin of grain. They happily said: "Although our labor power is not strong, as long as we raise pigs well, we will have food and money."

Another issue is that the price of manure must also be reasonable. Our method is to fix the price, grade the manure, and sign a contract between the cooperative and the household. As long as the members guarantee the quality, the cooperative will pay according to the contract. At the same time, for households without labor power, as long as they guarantee how much manure they accumulate in a month, the cooperative will pull as much soil as possible into the pigsty. In this way, all households became active in raising pigs.

Who Says Pig Feed is Hard to Find?

At first, the members had many concerns, the biggest problem being the lack of feed. The cooperative summarized the past experience of pig raising and found that some people fed pigs very well without a lot of grain, so they helped him summarize his experience and promoted it in the cooperative. The members had many methods, and the more they summarized, the wider the feed became. Later, they learned scientific knowledge and new methods from others, which solved the problem even more. Our cooperative's methods for solving pig feed are mainly the following: One is to use fermented feed when there is green grass in the spring. The method of making fermented feed is to chop the grass into eight-tenths to one inch long, put it in a water-filled urn and tamp it firmly, add three to four inches of water, and put a stone on top to press it. As long as the water is kept constant, it will rot in three days and can be fed. When feeding, just scoop out the feed, and the remaining water can also be used for fertilizer. The second method is to use silage feed. The method of silage is: when it is time to dig sweet potatoes, we first dig a large cellar underground—seven feet deep, seven feet wide, and thirteen feet long, which can hold twelve thousand to thirteen thousand jin. After the sweet potato vines are chopped, they are all piled into the cellar and tamped firmly, put some hay on top, and then bury one or two feet of soil. After a month, those sweet potato leaves and stems will rot, be very sweet, and the pigs will be willing to eat them. Take as much as you eat, don't take it all out. But don't let the cellar breathe, it is easy to spoil if it breathes. This is a very good and simple method.

The third method is to use various leaves to make spoiled feed. This method is to collect cotton, peanut, soybean, mung bean, sunflower various leaves, as well as poplar leaves, willow leaves, etc., a total of seventy kinds can be used, the more types of leaves, the more the pigs like to eat the spoiled feed. Dry and crush these leaves, fill them all into a large pit, one thousand jin of dry leaves mixed with one hundred jin of distillers' grains, after filling, water thoroughly, and then bury it with mud. After forty-five days, if you suddenly dig open the cellar, you will smell a taste similar to distillers' grains. This method is very good, not only do pigs like to eat it, but it can also be preserved for a long time without spoiling. We have a lot of cotton leaves here, and they are all fed to pigs.

The fourth method is dry storage. In the autumn, silage and spoilage are not possible. In addition to fermentation, cut some green grass to dry, store it well, and use it when there is no pig feed. There are also two kinds of grass that grow in the water that are good for feeding pigs. Pigs don't poop "donkey dung eggs" when they eat it, and each pig can save three cents a day. The members are also willing to use it. These methods are very effective, and there is no need to worry about feed. However, the members also reflected: "All kinds of leaves are fed to pigs, and there is no way to burn them." The cooperative stipulated that members who sweep one hundred jin of leaves for pigs can exchange them for one hundred and twenty jin of firewood at the cooperative. In this way, the members' enthusiasm is very high, and the whole village cleans up so that not even a leaf can fall.

Use Less Grain and Bean Cake, but the Pigs are Still Fed Very Well

With these feeds, the pigs eat less feed. In 1954, each pig ate one hundred and forty jin of bean cake and could be fed to one hundred and eighty to two hundred jin. Last year (1955), each pig only fed eighty jin of bean cake, but it was still fed very well. One method is to feed part of the pumpkin, especially in hot weather, pigs eat pumpkin very well, one hundred jin can top fifteen jin of bean cake. Another method is to feed red radish. Red radish is planted in wheat stubble land and is also a high-yield crop. Last year, one mu yielded twelve thousand jin. Boil it and feed it to the pigs, one hundred jin can top twelve jin of bean cake. Our cooperative also grinds one hundred jin of flour a day, and the flour slurry is also used to feed pigs. There are many jujube trees in our village. The comrades of the work team suggested using small dried jujubes to feed pigs. We tried it and it really solved the problem. Two jin of small jujubes can top one jin of bean cake. It is very sweet and nutritious, and pigs like to eat it very much. The cooperative picked up more than eight thousand jin in total. The cooperative gave three cents to members who picked up one jin of small jujubes. This not only increased the pig feed, but also helped households without labor solve the problem of eating oil and salt. In short, pay attention to everything, big and small, and there is no difficulty in solving feed.

Pig Feeding Should be Done in Separate Troughs

Let's talk about feeding management. Our cooperative also classifies and lines up pigs. Lining up means separating large pigs, small pigs, sows, and castrated pigs, and also separating those that eat fast and those that eat slowly. What are the benefits of this? Only by lining up can we master what pigs eat and make the pigs grow evenly. Small pigs should eat more grain from weaning to growing to forty jin. Pigs from forty jin to one hundred jin do not need to eat grain, only fermented, silage, spoiled, and dry-stored feed. Add grain and bean cake after raising it to more than one hundred jin. It is eating other feed, and then giving it grain to eat, it will be fat quickly. Sows with piglets cannot be given grain to eat for one and a half months, because sows are too fat and give birth to piglets very poorly; give it grain to eat one month before giving birth to pigs. Small pigs should be fed five meals a day, each meal a little less food, so that a small pig can grow fourteen taels to one jin a day. If you feed three meals, each meal has more food, it can only grow thirteen taels, at most fourteen taels. Because small pigs are prone to diarrhea when they eat too much, and they cannot grow meat for three days if they have diarrhea. The doors of our cooperative's pigsty face south, so there is enough sunshine and good air. Four pigs live in one pen, which is very convenient to manage.

Good Methods of Disease Prevention

Disease prevention is also very important. Our cooperative's current disease prevention methods: one is to rely on self-breeding and self-raising, and to educate members to avoid buying pork at the market as much as possible, for fear of spreading diseases by buying dead pork. When everyone wants to eat meat, they can request the approval of the management committee to slaughter pigs for themselves. Another method is to keep the pig troughs clean and brush them once after each feeding, three times a day. This is not only hygienic, but also saves pig feed. Don't look down on this small thing, brushing and clarifying one pig trough, one hundred troughs can save the feed for three pigs. Our cooperative also attaches great importance to selecting pig breeds. The breeds mixed with local pigs and Berkshire and Yorkshire grow fast, fat, and are disease-resistant.

Achieve Raising 20,000 Pigs This Year

After the expansion of our cooperative, in order to strengthen the leadership of pig-raising and manure-collecting work, the cooperative established a breeding stock under the management committee, with feed groups, technical groups, and veterinary groups under the stock, with fifty-nine breeders. Various management systems have also been established and the "four guarantees system" (guaranteeing work, guaranteeing breeding, guaranteeing manure accumulation, and guaranteeing disease prevention) has been promoted to overcome the chaotic phenomenon. For the pig-raising plan, first mobilize each member household to make a pig-raising and manure-collecting plan, and the cooperative also revised the original plan according to everyone's opinions. The plan is to set up sixteen pig farms, build two thousand two hundred pigsties, and jointly raise 20,000 pigs publicly and privately. After a spring, all the pig farms have now been built, more than two hundred pigsties have been built, plus the old ones there are already one thousand, and the pig-raising plan is guaranteed to be completed in stages.

  编者按　本月20日出版的“农村工作通讯”第八期，刊登了“我们一个社要养猪两万头”一文和毛泽东同志对这一篇文章的批语。在11月间举行的中共八届二中全会上，中共中央曾经把这篇文章和毛泽东同志的批语，印发给到会的同志阅读。
    我们一个社要养猪两万头
    山东省阳谷县石门乡农业生产合作社主任　宋保恩
    去年（1955）每人一头猪，每亩一千斤
    我社是1952年建立的，那时是十七户，现在是二千七百四十户。拿产量来说，1952年，平均每亩产量七百二十斤；到了1954年，平均产量就到了九百六十斤；去年（1955）的产量，每亩平均收到一千零九斤。为什么产量年年高呢？原因当然很多，但和社里养猪多有关系。去年（1955）8月，共养猪三百零八头，按当时计算，每户就平均五头猪，每人平均一头猪，每二亩二分地合一头猪。养猪多，积肥就多，地里多上粪，产量就提高了。合作社刚一扩大，因为许多新社员原来养的猪少，现在全社只养猪四千一百一十头，计划今年（1956）养猪达到两万头。
    大前年（1953）喂猪赔钱是什么原因
    我社养猪，是从1953年开始的，那时只养了七十五头，养得也不好。为什么呢？因为有的富裕中农参加了合作社，连猪也不养啦，他们认为养猪很麻烦，又嫌拉土积粪费工夫，不如化学肥料好。当时管理委员会受了富裕中农的影响，对养猪的领导就放松啦。养猪没有固定专人，都叫老年人去凑付着。他们养猪不讲新技术，给猪吃的豆饼很多，养得却很坏。一共养了七十五头猪，每头猪吃了三百斤豆饼，浪费很大，又因为没有注意防疫，死了三十来头，结果不但没有赚钱，每头猪还赔了两块多。那一年养猪少，积粪也少，用的化学肥料和大粪比较多，每亩地平均就合十一块到十二块钱，全年共折合六千来块钱。成本这样高，产量虽然提高了一些，算下账来，社员却不能增加收入，大家不满意。贫农社员批评我们只听富裕中农的话，没有按贫农的要求办事。1954年，管理委员会下决心改正头年的这个毛病。选拔了以社为家的三个社员当饲养员，两个是青年团员，一个是党员；给他们合理地评定了工分。又专门成立了养猪积肥委员会，由我担任主任委员；并且规定在检查生产计划的时候，也要检查养猪工作，完成计划好的表扬，完不成计划的批评。
    养猪不积极的人积极起来了
    这一年计划养猪一百四十头。管理委员会为了鼓励社员自己养猪，就分析了社员的三种情况：贫苦无劳动力的社员乐意养猪，但买不起小猪，也没饲料；一部分生活过的不错的社员，他们“脚踏两只船”，拿不定主意；还有一部分社员，因为粪的价格没确定好，也不愿养。根据这个分析，为了扶持贫苦社员养猪，社里拿钱买了小猪贷给他们，等喂到七、八十斤的时候，猪要吃粮食，他们养不起，就按食品公司规定的价格卖给合作社。这个办法，社与社员都不吃亏，还多养了猪。对于那些鳏寡孤独，社里贷给他们两头小猪，长到七、八十斤的时候，他们卖一头给社里，拿回钱去买豆饼喂另一头猪。这样就解决了他们的困难。有一户两口人，都七十多岁啦，社里贷给他们两头小猪，一年赚了二十八元钱，还积了十多车粪交给社里，得了三百斤粮食。又干了些轻活，挣了三百斤粮食。他们欢喜说：“我们虽然劳动力不强，只要好好养猪，也有吃的也有花的。”
    再一个问题是粪的价格，也一定要合理才行。我们采取的办法是：固定价格，圈粪分等，社与户订立合同。只要社员保证完成质量，社里就照合同给钱。同时，对于无劳动力户，只要保证一个月积多少粪，社里就给他往猪圈里拉多少土。这样各户对养猪就积极起来啦。
    谁说喂猪的饲料不好找
    开初社员们还有不少顾虑，最大的问题是饲料不足。社里总结过去喂猪的经验，发现有的人不用很多粮食将猪喂得很好，就帮他总结经验，在社里推广。社员的办法很多，越总结饲料越广。后来又学习了科学知识和别人的新办法，就更解决问题啦。我社解决猪饲料的办法主要有这样几个：一个是在春天有青草的时候，就用发酵饲料。做发酵饲料的方法是：将草铡成八分到一寸长，放在盛水的瓮里踩结实，添上三寸到四寸深的水，上边放上石头压着，只要不断水，三天烂了就可以喂。喂的时候，光将饲料捞出来，剩下的水还可以积肥。第二个办法是用青贮饲料。青贮的办法是：赶到要刨地瓜（甘薯）的时候，我们先在地下挖一个大窖子——有七尺深、七尺宽、一丈三尺长，能装一万二千到一万三千斤。将地瓜秧子铡了以后，都堆到窖子里边踏结实，放上一些干草，再埋上一尺到二尺的土。一个月以后，那些地瓜叶子和茎都烂了，甜味很大，猪很肯吃。吃多少拿多少，不要都拿出来。但是不要让窖子透空气，透了空气容易坏。这是一个很好又很简单的办法。
    第三个办法是用各种叶子做变糟的办法。这个办法是收集棉花、花生、黄豆、绿豆、向日葵各种各样的叶子，还有杨树叶子、柳树叶子等，一共有七十来样都可以用，叶子的种类越多，做出来的变糟猪越爱吃。把这些叶子晒干轧碎，全部填进大坑，一千斤干叶子掺上一百斤酒糟，填好以后，用水浇透，再用泥埋上它。待四十五天以后，你猛一扒开窖子，就会嗅到和酒糟差不多的味道。这个法子很好，不但猪很喜欢吃，而且可以保存很长日子不坏。我们这里棉花叶子很多，都给猪吃了。
    第四个法子就是干藏。在秋天的时候，搞青贮、变糟都不行，除了发酵以外，就是割点青草来晒干，保存好，到没有猪饲料的时候用。还有水里长的两种草也好喂猪，猪吃了不屙“驴粪蛋”，每头猪每天还可以省三分钱，社员们也很愿意用。这些办法都很管用，饲料不用发愁了。可是社员们又有反映：“各种叶子都喂了猪，烧的没有办法啦。”社里就规定了社员扫一百斤喂猪的叶子，到社里换一百二十斤柴。这么一来，社员情绪很高，全村拾掇的连一个叶子也掉不了。少用粮食和豆饼，猪还
      一样喂得很好
    有了这些饲料，猪吃的料就少了。1954年时，每头猪吃一百四十斤豆饼，能喂到一百八十斤到二百斤。去年（1955）每头猪只喂八十斤豆饼，但还喂得很好。一个办法是喂一部分南瓜，特别是热天，猪吃南瓜很好，一百斤能顶上十五斤豆饼。再一个办法，就是喂红萝卜，红萝卜在麦茬地里种，也是高产作物，去年一亩收了一万二千斤。拿它煮好了喂猪，一百斤能顶十二斤豆饼。我社一天还磨一百斤粉，粉浆也拿来喂猪。我村的枣树很多，工作组同志提议用小干巴枣喂猪，我们试了一试，可真解决问题。二斤小枣能顶上一斤豆饼，很甜，养分也大，猪很喜欢吃。社里共拾了八千多斤。社员拾一斤小枣，社里给他三分钱，这不但增加了猪的饲料，也帮助无劳力户解决了吃油吃盐的问题。总之，大事小事都看上眼，解决饲料就没啥困难。
    喂猪要实行分槽
    再谈谈饲养管理。我社喂猪也分类排队，排队就是将大猪、小猪、母猪、克朗猪都分开，将吃得快的、吃得慢的也分开。这有啥好处呢？排开队才好掌握啥猪啥食，使猪长得均匀。小猪从吃奶到长成四十斤，要多吃粮食。四十斤到一百斤的猪，不必吃粮食，只用发酵、青贮、变糟和干藏饲料。养到一百斤以上再加粮食、豆饼。它正吃着别的饲料，再给它粮食吃，肥得很快。母猪有了小猪，一个半月不能给它粮食吃，因为母猪太肥了，生小猪生得很不好；临生猪一个月的时候，再给它粮食吃。小猪一天要喂五顿，每顿少点食，这样一头小猪一天能长十四两到一斤。若喂三顿，每顿的食多了，只能长十三两，最多长到十四两。因为小猪吃多了好拉稀，一拉稀三天不能长肉。我社的猪圈门朝南，这样阳光足，空气好。一个圈里面住四头猪，管理起来很方便。
      防疫的好办法
    对于防疫工作也很要紧。我社现在的防疫办法：一个是靠自繁自养，教育社员尽量不到集上买猪肉，怕的是买了死猪肉传染疾病。大家要吃肉时可请求管理委员会的批准，自己杀猪吃。再一个办法，就是保持猪食槽子的干净，每次喂完猪以后要刷一回，一天刷三回。这不但讲卫生，也节约猪食。别看这是小事，一个猪槽子刷一刷、澄一澄，一百个槽子就能省出三头猪的饲料来。我社也很重视选猪种，土种猪和巴克夏、约克夏杂交的种，长得又快又胖又抗病。
  今年做到养猪两万头
    我社扩大以后，社里为了加强养猪积肥工作的领导，在管理委员会下设立饲养股，股以下分饲料组、技术组、兽医组，有五十九个饲养员。并且建立了各种管理制度，推行“四包制”（包工、包养、包积肥、包防疫），克服了混乱现象。对于养猪计划，先发动每户社员订好养猪积肥计划，社里也按照大家的意见修订了原来的计划，计划设猪场十六个，建猪圈二千二百来个，公、私共养猪两万头。过了一个春天，现在猪场已全部建好，猪圈已搭成二百多个，加上旧有的已有一千来个，养猪计划有把握分期完成。
