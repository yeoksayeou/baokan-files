Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, December 15th: The "Labor People's News" published on the 15th the resolution of the Central Committee of the Finnish Communist Party on the international situation and the party's tasks.

    The resolution pointed out that although the British and French aggressors were forced to cease fire and withdraw from the occupied areas, the danger of war has not been completely prevented. Therefore, all peace forces that defend the national freedom of colonial and other countries need to maintain vigilance and be active.

    In this regard, the resolution pointed out the great significance of the Soviet Union's recent disarmament proposals for the cause of peace.

    The resolution then discussed the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary, pointing out the necessity of Soviet troops assisting the socialist forces in Hungary. It said that it was precisely because of this assistance that the emergence of a new source of war in Europe was prevented.

    The resolution pointed out that the offensive launched by the reactionaries everywhere against the Communist Party and other democratic forces has been repelled recently. It said that in this struggle, the Finnish Communist Party, as before, considers it its duty to support the fraternal workers' parties, and to support the international front against war and against reactionaries.

    The resolution finally talked about the tasks of the Finnish Communist Party. It pointed out that the most important tasks at present are: to defend peace and democracy, while uniting all working people and trade union organizations to fight against high prices and to strive for wage increases.

Xinhua News Agency, Brussels: The Belgian Communist Party published a "Letter to Workers" in the "Red Flag" on the 15th, exposing the conspiracy of the reactionaries to launch an anti-communist movement.

    The letter reminded everyone to pay attention to the clamor made by bourgeois newspapers and radio stations surrounding the Hungarian incident. It pointed out that the purpose of this action is to create a nervous atmosphere in Belgium, so that the Belgian working people will leave their struggle to increase wages and improve living conditions. The situation of the working people has recently deteriorated due to rising prices. At the same time, the bourgeoisie needs to justify its policy of expanding armaments through this practice.

    The letter then pointed out that the reactionaries launched an anti-communist movement in order to split the Communist Party and the unity of the working people, weaken their party, and create divisions within the party. But the conspiracy of the reactionaries did not succeed. The Communist Party still exists and continues to fight for the interests of the working people.

    The Belgian Communist Party finally called on workers to firmly defend their demands and unswervingly fight for democracy and peace.

    芬共和比共号召保卫和平打击反共阴谋
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基15日讯：“劳动人民报”15日登载了芬兰共产党中央委员会关于国际形势和党的任务的决议。
    决议指出，英法侵略者虽然被迫停火和退出占领区，可是，战争的危险还没有完全被防止。因此，一切捍卫殖民地和其他国家人民的民族自由的和平力量还需要保持警惕性和积极性。
    在这方面，决议中指出了苏联最近的裁军建议对和平事业的巨大意义。
    决议接着谈到匈牙利的反革命暴动，指出苏联军队援助匈牙利社会主义力量的必要性，它说，正是由于这种援助才制止了欧洲新战争策源地的产生。
    决议指出，最近反动派到处对共产党和其他民主力量发动的进攻已经被击退。它说，在这一斗争中，芬兰共产党和以前一样，认为支持兄弟工人党、支持反对战争和反对反动派的国际战线，是自己的职责。
    决议最后谈到芬兰共产党的任务。它指出，目前最重要的任务是：保卫和平和民主，同时团结一切劳动人民和工会组织，为反对物价高涨、为争取增加工资而斗争。
    新华社16日讯　塔斯社布鲁塞尔讯：比利时共产党15日在“红旗报”上发表“致工人的信”，揭露反动派发动反共运动的阴谋。
    这封信提醒大家注意资产阶级报纸和电台围绕着匈牙利事件而发出的喧嚷。它指出，这种行动的目的，是在比利时国内制造神经过敏的气氛，使比利时劳动人民离开他们争取增加工资和改善生活条件的斗争。劳动人民的处境最近已经因为物价上涨而日益恶化。同时，资产阶级需要通过这种做法来为它扩充军备的政策辩护。
    这封信接着指出，反动派发动反共运动，还为了分裂共产党和劳动人民的团结，削弱他们的党，并且使党内发生分歧。但是反动派的阴谋没有得逞。共产党依然存在，并且继续为劳动人民的利益而斗争。
    比利时共产党最后号召工人坚决地维护自己的要求，坚定不移地为民主、和平而斗争。
