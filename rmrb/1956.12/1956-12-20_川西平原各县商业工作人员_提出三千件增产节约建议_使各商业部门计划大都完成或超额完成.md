Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 18th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Quanyu reports: Commercial workers in seventeen counties of the Western Sichuan Plain have, from June of this year to the present, put forward three thousand suggestions related to increasing production and practicing economy. Due to the adoption and promotion of many rationalization proposals, the various plans of the commercial departments have mostly been fulfilled or overfulfilled.

The commodity circulation expenses of the department store system in the third quarter alone were reduced by 0.04% compared to the original plan, and capital turnover accelerated by 0.12 times.

These three thousand rationalization proposals involve every aspect of the commercial departments. Salespersons at the Qionglai County Department Store created a "follow-the-tag sales method." They take advantage of times when there are fewer customers who are not at a fair, attaching a small tag with the name and price of each item. Customers can see the price when they see the item and do not have to ask the price of each item. After the item is sold, the salesperson removes the tag as a basis for bookkeeping, which is very convenient for customers and avoids bookkeeping errors for the store. The department store warehouse in this county used to be very chaotic, with slow loading and unloading and large losses. Recently, they accepted the suggestions of the warehouse managers, adopted a method of storing goods by dividing and classifying the warehouse, and improved the labor organization and management system. Now, it only takes six hours to move ten tons of goods into (or out of) the warehouse, which is eighteen hours less than the prescribed twenty-four hours. At the same time, the commodity loss per quarter is also greatly reduced compared to the past. Slaughterhouse workers at the Chongqing County Food Company improved the method of slaughtering pigs, reducing the number of people required for slaughtering pigs from three to one. He Defu, a pig skinning worker at the Shifang County Food Company, improved the pig skinning procedure, saving half the manpower.

In the past, no matter whether the rat holes in the grain warehouse were repaired with cement or wooden boards, the rats had the ability to bite through them. Recently, the staff of the Hesheng Township Warehouse in Wenjiang County experimented with using bamboo shoots from the local Cizhu bamboo to fill the holes. The rats are afraid of the barbs on the bamboo shoots and avoid them, daring not to approach. Recently, they are studying the use of bamboo shoots (which are plentiful and cheap locally) to wrap the entire wooden part of the warehouse to fundamentally eliminate rat holes.

    川西平原各县商业工作人员
    提出三千件增产节约建议
    使各商业部门计划大都完成或超额完成
    新华社成都18日电　新华社记者喻权域报道：川西平原十七个县的商业工作人员，从今年6月到现在已提出了三千件有关增产节约的建议。由于许多合理化建议的采用和推广，各商业部门的各项计划大都完成或超额完成了。
    仅百货公司系统三季度的商品流转费用就比原计划降低0.04％，资金周转加速零点一二次。
    这三千件合理化建议涉及到商业部门的每一个环节。邛崃县百货公司营业员创造了一种“跟吊牌售货法”，他们利用不逢集顾客少的时候，给每一件商品都吊上一块写着品名和价格的小牌，顾客看到商品就可了解价格，不必逐件问价。商品卖出后，营业员取下牌子作为记账依据，这样，顾客很方便，商店也避免了记账的差错。这个县的百货公司仓库过去很混乱，进出货慢，损耗大。最近他们接受仓库管理员们的建议，采用了分仓分类办法堆放货物，并改进了劳动组合和管理制度，现在每十吨货的进仓（或出仓）只需要六小时，比规定的时间二十四小时少十八小时。同时，每季度的商品损耗也比过去大大减少。崇庆县食品公司屠场工人，改进杀猪方法，将杀猪时所需人数由三人减少为一人，什邡县食品公司剥猪皮工人何德福，改进剥猪皮的程序，节省了一半人力。
    粮食仓库的鼠洞，过去不论是用水泥还是木板补起的漏洞，老鼠都有本事咬穿。温江县合盛乡仓库工作人员，最近试验用本地土产慈竹上的笋壳补洞后，老鼠怕笋壳上的毛刺，都避而远去，不敢接近，最近，他们正在研究用笋壳（本地很多，价钱也便宜）把整个仓库的木制部分包起来，以根本杜绝鼠洞。
