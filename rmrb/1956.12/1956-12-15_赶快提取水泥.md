    Hurry Up and Extract Cement
    The demand for cement in the Sichuan region has been consistently exceeding supply this year. However, the cement produced by the Chongqing Cement Plant is piling up in large quantities. The plant frequently has to halt production because the warehouse is full, which severely affects the completion of production tasks. Due to the warehouse being full, the cement mill was shut down for 134 hours in August, resulting in a reduction of 3,121 tons of cement; in September, the cement mill was shut down for 103 hours, resulting in a reduction of 1,307 tons of cement. Because there is too much cement piled up in the warehouse, the cement stacked in the storage area and the packaging machine room has greatly exceeded the normal prescribed quantity. The normal regulation only allows stacking up to 18 bags high, but in reality, it is stacked up to 30 bags, and sometimes even up to 42 bags. Due to the excessive height of the stacks, a tragic accident occurred on October 31, where a stack of packaged cement collapsed, killing two workers. In addition, the warehouse being full has also forced changes in maintenance schedules, alterations in product varieties, and disruptions to work plans, creating artificial difficulties for production management and affecting the workers' enthusiasm for production.
    Why is there a product backlog? Mainly, some users, seeing the tight cement supply, falsely report urgent needs and exaggerate quantities when submitting order plans. As a result, they cannot pick up the goods in a timely manner, and the factory is full like a warehouse. Secondly, transportation tensions also affect the delivery of cement from the factory.
    We request that relevant departments, especially users, attach importance to solving this problem. Liu Fengming

### 赶快提取水泥

    赶快提取水泥
    四川地区的水泥，今年以来一直是供不应求的。但是重庆水泥厂生产出来的水泥却大量积压，经常库满停车，严重地影响生产任务的完成。由于库满，8月份水泥磨停车一百三十四小时，减产水泥三千一百二十一吨；9月份水泥磨停车一百零三小时，减产水泥一千三百零七吨。由于仓库积压的水泥过多，栈房和包装机房堆积的水泥也大大超过正常规定的数量。正常规定只许堆高十八袋，实际堆积达三十袋，甚至有时堆到四十二袋。由于堆积过高，造成10月31日包装水泥垛倒塌，砸死工人两名的惨痛事故。此外，由于库满，还被迫变更检修时间，改变产品品种，打乱作业计划，给生产管理上造成人为困难，影响了工人的生产热情。
    为什么会造成产品积压呢？主要是有些用户看见水泥供应紧张，在提出订货计划时虚报急用，夸大数量。结果不能及时提货，把工厂当仓库积压满了。其次是运输紧张，也影响到水泥的出厂。
    要求有关部门，特别是用户重视解决这个问题。　刘凤鸣
