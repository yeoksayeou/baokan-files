Xinhua News Agency, December 27th – Song Qingling, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, wrote a New Year's greeting to the Soviet magazine "Spark" for 1957. The full text is as follows:

    Welcome the arrival of 1957!
    Hope that the international situation tends towards relaxation!
    I believe that the forces of peace are growing stronger day by day,
    Because the desire of people all over the world to strive for peace is unprecedentedly strong.
    Only a small handful of aggressive and reactionary rulers attempt to destroy peace and restore colonialism.
    But they are met with righteous resistance, and their conspiracies ultimately fail.
    The people should become more aware,
    Unite more closely,
    Forming an iron-like force,
    To stop the aggressors' reckless actions.
    The Chinese people and I extend our best wishes to the people of the world for happiness and prosperity!
                                      Song Qingling, December 15, 1956

Xinhua News Agency, December 27th – Song Qingling, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, wrote a New Year's greeting to the Soviet magazine "New Times" for 1957. The full text is as follows:

    May tensions ease in 1957! I believe this is possible because the people's desire for peace is currently more fervent than ever before. A small handful of reactionaries have attempted to undo the good progress made in this regard during the latter part of this year, but each time they have met with the appropriate rebuff. This should be able to clarify people's thinking, increase their courage, and inspire them to unite and make even greater efforts to strive for peace and progress.
    The Chinese people, along with me, extend our congratulations to the people of the world here, wishing them health and prosperity in 1957.

    给苏联“星火”和“新时代”杂志
    宋庆龄的新年贺词
    新华社27日讯　中苏友好协会总会会长宋庆龄给苏联“星火”杂志写的1957年新年贺词。全文如下：
    迎接1957年的来临！
    期望国际局势趋向和缓！
    我相信和平势力日臻壮大，
    因为全世界人民争取和平的心愿空前强烈。
    只有一小撮的侵略成性的反动统治者企图毁灭和平，恢复殖民主义。
    但是他们受到正义反击，阴谋终于失败。
    人民应当更醒觉起来，
    更紧密地团结一致，
    形成钢铁般的力量，
    阻止侵略者的蠢动。
    中国人民和我一道谨祝全世界人民康乐和繁荣！

    新华社27日讯　中苏友好协会总会会长宋庆龄给苏联“新时代”杂志写的1957年新年贺词。全文如下：
    愿在1957年紧张局势会缓和下来！我相信这是可能的，因为人民对于和平的愿望目前比过去任何时候都要热切。一小撮反动分子在今年后一段时期曾经试图抵消在这方面所取得的良好成绩，但是他们每一次都遭到应有的反击。这应当能够使人们澄清思想，增加勇气，并且鼓舞他们团结起来，作更加巨大的努力，争取和平和进步。
    中国人民同我一道在这里向全世界人民祝贺，预祝他们在1957年健康、繁荣。
                                      宋庆龄　1956年12月15日
