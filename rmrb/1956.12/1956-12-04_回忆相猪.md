Title: Recollections of Judging Pigs

    There is a classic text for judging horses, one for judging cattle, and also one for judging pigs. When I was a child, I saw a book on judging pigs printed on grass paper in a farmer's house, but unfortunately, I didn't pay attention to it at the time. However, the farmers in my hometown all knew that certain types of pigs were easy to feed and grew quickly, while others were difficult to feed and didn't grow well.
    Children from the same mother are not all the same height and weight; similarly, piglets from the same sow grow at different rates and to different sizes.
    "When buying piglets, look at the mother's lineage; when buying puppies, look at the father's lineage." Whether this saying, popular in my hometown, has a scientific basis is something I won't go into for now. But in my hometown, people raising sows always choose good little female pigs. A sow with a large frame gives birth to many strong piglets. "An old sow is castrated with a single knife"; good old sows gain weight quickly after castration and can grow to two or three hundred catties of meat.
    My family never raised sows, but my neighbors did. Taking care of a sow is like taking care of a woman in childbirth; someone has to sleep next to the pigsty at night, tending to each piglet as it is born, placing it in a soft grass nest, helping it to nurse, and preventing it from being crushed or bitten by the mother pig. The piglets are fed white rice porridge, which is better than the thin porridge cooked in some kitchens nowadays. There should be a suitable place for the piglets to exercise. Piglets raised in this way are fat, tender, lively, and strong, and easy to grow.
    Liusha River (twenty or thirty miles from my hometown) is a famous place for producing piglets. People from hundreds of miles away go there to buy piglets, and some piglet peddlers even falsely claim to be from Liusha River, which shows people's emphasis on the quality of piglets. Later, the experience of raising piglets in Liusha River gradually spread, and people buying piglets didn't necessarily have to go to Liusha River, but there are still many people raising sows there.
    Both piglets and semi-grown pigs should be carefully selected. Not every good piglet will grow into a good semi-grown pig. For the same household, the best semi-grown pigs can gain more than twenty to thirty catties of meat per month during fattening, while the worst can only gain ten catties or so, and they don't grow very large. Comrade He Shuheng liked to raise large pigs, some weighing over three hundred catties of meat. Chairman Mao visited his home, and Old Master He was most proud of showing Mr. Mao his large pigs. They had a set of experiences for judging pigs: such as the mouth should be short, and the ears should be large; thin skin and sparse back hair, buttocks cut straight across; the size of the feet should be uniform, and not "crotch-bound" (hind legs curved inward); pigs with hanging bellies don't gain fat, and pigs with dragging bellies are easy to fatten but don't grow very large, etc.
    It goes without saying that raising pigs requires good feed, but it doesn't necessarily require spending a lot of grain. My father was not a manual laborer, but he personally cooked pig feed, mixed pig feed, and cleaned the pigsty. Green fodder had to be chopped finely and cooked until soft, and mixed by hand to prevent hard objects from being inside. Pig feed that is too hot or too cold hinders the growth of the pigs. Bran should be used in the pig feed, "Without bran, the stomach won't be filled," Sun Wukong scolds Zhu Bajie as a "bran-filled fool," which shows that feeding bran has been around for a long time. Pigs swallow their food whole, and it cannot be digested without fine chopping and long cooking. Some refined feed is necessary, but don't only eat refined feed. I saw a pig trough in an agricultural cooperative in Shandong that was full of wheat bran. I thought it was not cost-effective. The pig's belly is very large. After eating a bellyful of refined feed, it is impossible to grow a lot of meat immediately.
    Raising pigs requires good care, proper feeding methods, and reliance on labor. The labor of raising pigs can be done by women, the elderly, and even children.
      "The rich rely on studying, the poor rely on raising pigs," but in fact, the rich also rely on raising pigs. I taught in a private school in the home of a big landlord. His family raised twenty or thirty pigs. The pigsty was in a large courtyard, warm in winter and cool in summer. The pigs slept on a floor a foot or so off the ground, which was very clean. In winter, they salted more than ten pigs to make very exquisite preserved pork, which was very delicious. I taught there for a year, and there were many days when I ate preserved pork. Small and medium landlords, rich, middle, and poor peasants all rely on raising pigs, only the amount and size they raise are different. Poor peasants cannot afford to raise large pigs, and they sell them as soon as they grow into semi-grown pigs and buy piglets again.
    Saying that pigs are dirty is because people make them dirty. In fact, pigs like to be clean and always choose clean places to sleep. They know how to separate the places where they sleep and where they defecate, as long as you have the facilities for it.
    Pigs also know how to listen to people. For example, if a strange pig is added to the pen, they will fight. Fighting can cause the pigs to lose weight, so education is needed. The method of education is to use a whip, whipping and scolding at the same time. After two or three times, they will reconcile.
    Pigs should be kept locked up, especially when fattening, so that they can eat and sleep, and sleep and eat. Therefore, people often call those who only eat and drink without working "fattened pigs."
    I remember seeing a sign in a Shanghai alley that said "Transporting Famous Pigs." I am familiar with the terms "famous people" and "famous horses," but "famous pigs" was the first time I had heard it. I don't know what Shanghai's "famous pigs" are like, but pigs like those in my hometown, black and white, with beautiful coats, thin skin, thick meat, broad back, large belly, and strong legs; when the belly is cut open after slaughter, a hot and fragrant aroma rushes out; the meat is fragrant and the soup is sweet. They can be called "famous pigs."
    I am not a pig farmer but a meat eater. What someone who is not a pig farmer says may not be right, it is an outsider's view. As a meat eater, I often feel that the quality of the pork supplied in the market now is not as good as what I used to eat. I hope that in the work of developing pig production, in addition to adjusting the purchase and sale prices to make raising pigs profitable, adjusting the supply of feed to avoid reducing raising due to lack of feed, and carrying out both collective raising by agricultural cooperatives and private raising by members, we should also widely collect folk experiences and techniques in raising sows, piglets, selecting breeds, and judging pigs, and research and promote them, so that not only will the number of pigs increase, but also the quality of pigs will continue to improve.
    By the way, let me talk about the pork purchase and sale relationship in my hometown decades ago. In Ningxiang, where there is boat traffic, fat pigs were shipped directly to Hankou. In places with inconvenient transportation, they were only "slaughtered and sold" locally. When I was a child, I watched my father raise pigs and gradually became interested in pigs. Every time I saw a pig growing well, I was a little confused when an old man from the slaughterhouse suddenly came to drive it away. A day later, I was even more puzzled when my father brought back a basket of intestinal fat (watery fat). I asked, "Why does the slaughterhouse only give us a little oil from the pigs we raise?" My father laughed when he heard this, and so did others. Did I say something wrong? I don't think I said anything wrong. I didn't solve this puzzle until I was ten years old a few years later. In our place, the slaughterhouse bought pigs and weighed the shells of the pigs after slaughter, at a price of eighty cash per catty. The slaughterhouse sold meat for seventy-two cash per catty. The purchase price was higher than the selling price. Intestinal fat was returned to the pig owner, and one-tenth was deducted according to the pig price, regardless of the amount. Back fat was weighed on the pig shell, but the slaughterhouse sold back fat at a price equivalent to two catties of meat; intestines, stomach, heart, and lungs were not charged, and the slaughterhouse still sold them with the meat. In this way, the slaughterhouse could still earn about two or three strings of cash from a two-hundred-catty meat pig, even though the pig price was sixteen strings.

    回忆相猪
　　谢觉哉
    相马有马经，相牛有牛经，相猪也有猪经。小时候在一个农民家里看到一本草纸印的相猪的书，可惜当时不知道注意。但是，我乡的农民，谁都知道一点子那样的猪好喂、肯长，那样的猪不好喂、不肯长。
    同一个母亲养出的儿女，高矮肥瘦不是一样；同样，同一个母猪养出的小猪，它们长成的速度、大小，也不一样。
    “买猪仔、看娘种，买狗仔、看爷种”。这句在我们乡里流行的话，是否有科学根据，暂不管它。但我们乡下养母猪的定要选择好的小雌猪。架子高大的母猪，下的小猪多而且壮。“猪婆子到老一刀阉”，好的老母猪阉后，积膘快，可以长到二三百斤的肉。
    我家没养过母猪，我的邻家养过。侍候母猪同侍候产妇一样，晚上要有人睡在猪圈旁，生一只侍弄一只，放在软草窝里，要捧着它去就奶，要防备被母猪压坏或咬它。喂小猪，用白米粥，比现在有些厨房煮的稀饭要好。要有适当场所供小猪运动。这样养出的小猪：肥嫩、活泼、有力，易于长大。
    流沙河（离我乡二三十里）是著名产小猪的地方，百里以外的人都去那里买小猪，也有贩小猪的人冒称是流沙河的，可见人们对小猪质量的重视。后来流沙河养小猪的经验逐渐得到传播，买小猪的不一定要去流沙河，但流沙河养母猪的仍然多。
    买小猪和架子猪都要很好选择，不一定每个好的小猪都能长成好的架子。同样的槽户，顶好的架子，在积膘时每月可长二十多斤至三十斤肉，不好的只能长十来斤，而且长不很大。何叔衡同志家里喜欢养大猪，大的有三百斤以上的肉，毛主席到过他家里，何老太爷最得意的是请毛先生看他的大猪。他们有一套相猪的经验：如嘴要短，耳要大；皮薄脊毛稀，屁股一斩齐；脚的大小要均称，不要“夹裆”
  （后腿向里弯）；吊肚子猪不长油，拖肚皮猪易肥但长不大等。
    养猪要有好饲料，是不待说的，但不一定要多花粮食。我父亲不是一个体力劳动者，但煮猪食、调猪食、打扫猪圈，是亲自动手的。青饲草要斩的细、煮的烂，调时要用手搓过，防止有硬的东西在里面。猪食过热过凉，都妨碍猪的生长。猪食内要用糠，“不喂糠，不塞肚”，孙猴子骂猪八戒是“馕糠的夯货”，可见喂糠是由来已久。猪吃食是囫囵吞下，不细切久煮，不能消化。精饲料要有一些，但不要光吃精饲料。我在山东见一个农业社的猪槽，全是麦麸皮，我以为是不合算的，猪肚皮很大，吃下一肚皮精饲料，不可能马上长出很多肉。
    养猪要侍弄得好，要饲养得法，要靠劳动。养猪的劳动，妇女、老人以至小孩都干得了。
      “富人靠读书，穷人靠养猪”，其实富人也靠养猪。我在一个大地主家教过蒙馆，他家养有二、三十只猪，猪圈在一个大院落里，冬温夏凉，猪睡在离地一尺多高的地板上，很干净。冬天腌上十多只猪做很考究的腊肉，很好吃；我在那里教一年书，吃腊肉的日子很多。中小地主、富、中、贫农都靠喂猪，只是喂的多少、大小不同，贫农喂不起大猪，长成架子就卖了，另外买进小猪。
    说猪脏，是人使它脏的。其实猪爱干净，总拣干净的地方睡。睡和拉屎尿的地方它知道分开，只要你有此设备。
    猪也知道听人话。比如圈内加入一只陌生的猪，就要打架，打架可以使猪退膘，这时要进行教育。教育的方法是用鞭子，边打边骂，打二、三次，它们就和好了。
    猪要关起，尤其是积膘的时候，让它吃了睡，睡了吃。所以平常骂那些只吃喝不劳动的人叫做“喂壮猪”。
    记得在上海一个弄堂里，看到一块“贩运名猪”的招牌；“名人”“名马”的称呼是熟悉的，“名猪”在我还是第一次听到。上海的“名猪”是怎样的，我不知道；但如我乡的猪，黑白相间、毛色好看、皮薄、肉厚、背宽、腹大、腿壮；杀后破肚时有一股热而香的气冲出；吃起来肉香汤甜。可以称得起“名猪”。
    我不是一个养猪的而是一个吃肉的。不是养猪的讲的话也许不对头，是外行。是一个吃肉的，常感到现在市面供应的猪肉的质量不及我以前吃过的那样好。我希望在发展生猪生产的工作中，除开调整购销价格，使养猪的有利可图；调整饲料的供应，使不因缺乏饲料而少养；农业社集体养和社员私养同时进行之外，还应该广泛地收集民间饲养母猪、小猪、选种、相猪等经验、技术，加以研究推广，不仅要使猪的数量增加，而且要使猪的质量不断地得到提高。
    顺便谈谈几十年前我乡的猪肉购销关系。宁乡通船的地方，肥猪运销城市直运到汉口。交通不便的地方，只是就地“杀卖”。我小时候看父亲养猪，逐渐对猪发生兴趣。每见猪长得正好，屠坊一位老头忽来赶去的时候，有点茫然；过一天我父亲提了一筐子肠油（水油）回来，尤其不解。我问：“为什么我家养的猪，屠坊里只给我们一点油？”父亲听了笑，其他人也笑。难道我的话讲错了么？我想一点没有错。这个闷葫芦，到几年后我十岁多了才解开。我们那里屠坊买猪，杀后称猪的壳壳，每斤制钱八十文，屠坊卖肉，每斤七十二文，买价比卖价高。肠油退猪主，不管多少照猪价扣十分之一；板油连在猪壳上过秤，但屠坊出卖板油，一斤抵二斤肉的价；肠肚心肺不算钱，屠坊仍搭在肉中卖出。这样：二百斤的肉猪，猪价一十六串，屠坊仍可赚约二串至三串的钱。
