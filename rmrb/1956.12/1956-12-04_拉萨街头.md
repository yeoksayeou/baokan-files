    The streets of Lhasa are now bustling with trade. Trucks loaded with mainland goods and construction materials from the Kangzang and Qingzang highways honk their horns as they pass through the bustling city. Cars, motorcycles, and bicycles flow in an endless stream on the streets.

    When I first arrived in Lhasa in 1952, it was also the beginning of winter. Back then, on the cobblestone streets of Lhasa, you wouldn't see a single cargo truck; only Tibetan merchants traveled back and forth with mules. Farmers from the countryside would drive small donkeys in and out of the city.

    With the development of various construction projects in Tibet, a new scene has emerged on the streets of Lhasa. New buildings are constantly being erected next to the ancient structures. Five deserted small alleys have been transformed into bustling markets. Some places that used to be garbage dumps have also seen rows of shops and stalls with white canopies. Many canteens, bathhouses, barbershops, clothing stores, and photography studios have opened. The number of street vendors, shopkeepers, and stallholders on the streets of Lhasa has increased from over 700 in 1953 to over 3,000. In the Barkhor Street, which circles around the Jokhang Temple, the shops are filled with all kinds of goods. From high-end wool fabrics and silks to jewelry; from bronze Buddhas and pulu (Tibetan woolen fabric) to famous local products such as musk and otter pelts, everything is available.

    Since the Kangzang and Qingzang highways opened to Lhasa, inexpensive and high-quality domestic goods have aroused great interest among customers here. Now, not only have state-owned trading companies expanded, but there are also more than ten domestic goods sales stores on the streets of Lhasa, each of which is always crowded with people choosing goods. According to comrades from the Tibet Trade General Company, the turnover of stores that sell domestic goods has increased five or six times, or even ten times, compared to before. This fact has prompted many Tibetan merchants in Lhasa to gradually shift their capital from trading foreign goods to trading domestic goods.

    Blacksmiths, carpenters, and tailors' shops are particularly busy. It is said that even the most skilled artisans used to have two days of leisure out of three. Due to the gradual improvement of the people's lives in Tibet, the demand for Lhasa's handicraft products from various places has also increased relatively. More than ten hat shops on Barkhor Street once accepted an order from the state-owned Tibet Trade General Company for 700 gold-rimmed Tibetan hats.

    The streets are full of people coming and going. Tibetan herdsmen from northern Tibet, wearing sheepskin robes and hanging waist knives, are selling fresh butter, beef, mutton, and various animal skins. Farmers from the suburbs of Lhasa drive yaks and small donkeys early in the morning, bringing tsampa, wheat, peas, and other agricultural products to the city. After noon, they return with copper pots, iron kettles, or tea and cloth.

    In the evening, many Tibetan officials and staff members walk out of the offices of the fourteen departments, commissions, and offices under the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Tibetan and Hui children wearing red scarves are dismissed from school and walk through the streets singing. Tibetan workers and students from various Tibetan cadre training classes in Lhasa also appear on the streets in groups. At this time, Buddhists holding prayer beads and prayer wheels begin their evening prayers peacefully around the Jokhang Temple.

    At night, the electricity transmitted from the Lhasa Hydropower Plant, located eight kilometers north of the city, illuminates the streets of Lhasa, and the night market begins.

　　拉萨街头
　　新华社记者　宗子度
    现在在拉萨街头，人们可以看到买卖很热闹。从康藏和青藏两条公路上来的满载内地物资和建筑器材的卡车，鸣着喇叭从闹市驶过。街上汽车、摩托车、自行车川流不息。
    1952年我初到拉萨，也是这样的初冬季节。那时在拉萨鹅卵石铺成的街道上，看不见一部运货卡车，只有藏族商人带着骡马来往。从乡下来的农民，赶着小毛驴进出市区。
    随着西藏各项建设事业的发展，拉萨街头出现了新的景象。古老的建筑物旁边不断矗立起新的房屋。五条冷落的小巷已经变成了闹市。有些以前堆放垃圾的地方，也出现了一排排的商店和撑着白色帐幕的地摊。许多食堂、浴室、理发馆、成衣店和摄影社已经开设起来。拉萨街头上的行商、座商和摊贩，已经从1953年的七百多户增加到三千来户。在以大昭寺为中心环绕一圈的八角街上，商店里摆满了各种货物。从高级的呢绒、绸缎到珠宝首饰；从铜佛、氆氇到麝香、水獭等著名的土特产品，应有尽有。
    康藏、青藏公路通车拉萨以后，价廉物美的国货已经在这里引起了顾客们很大的兴趣。现在，不仅国营贸易公司扩大了，拉萨街上还有了十多家国货购销店，每一家国货购销店里都经常拥挤着选购东西的人群。据西藏贸易总公司的同志说，凡是经营国货的购销店，营业额都比以前增加了五六倍以至十来倍。这一事实促使了拉萨市的许多藏族商人逐渐把资金由经营外货转为经营国货。
    铁匠、木匠和裁缝铺，生意特别旺盛。据说过去就是手艺再好的匠人，三天也有两天闲着。由于西藏人民生活逐步改善，各地对拉萨手工艺产品的需要量也相对增加。八角街上的十多家帽子商店，一次就接受了国营西藏贸易总公司七百顶金边藏帽的订货。
    街上到处是来来往往的人群。穿着羊皮袄、挂着腰刀的藏北牧民们，在出售新鲜的酥油和牛羊肉以及各种兽皮。拉萨市郊的农民，一清早就赶着牦牛和小毛驴，带着糌粑、小麦、豌豆等农产品来到城里，中午以后，他们又带着铜锅、铁壶，或者是茶叶、布匹等回去。
    傍晚，从西藏自治区筹备委员会所属十四个厅、委、处的办公室里，走出了许多藏族官员和工作人员。系着红领巾的藏族、回族儿童放学了，他们唱着歌走过街头。藏族工人和拉萨市各个藏族干部训练班的学员们，也成群结队出现在街上。这时，手拿念珠和转经筒的佛教徒们，在大昭寺周围安详地开始了晚上的祈祷。
    入夜，从城北八公里外的拉萨水电厂输送过来的电流照亮了拉萨街头，夜市开始了。
