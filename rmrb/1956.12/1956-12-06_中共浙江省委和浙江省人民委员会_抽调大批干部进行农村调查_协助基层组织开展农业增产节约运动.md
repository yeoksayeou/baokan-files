    The CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee and Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee
    Dispatch a Large Number of Cadres to Conduct Rural Surveys
    Assist Grassroots Organizations in Carrying Out the Agricultural Production Increase and Thrift Movement
    (Our newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, December 5th) The CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee and Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee recently dispatched more than 400 cadres from government organs to go deep into the countryside to conduct investigation and research work, assisting Party and government organizations at all levels in launching a broad agricultural production increase and thrift movement. A group of cadres led by the Secretary of the CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee and some members of the Provincial Committee have arrived in Ningbo, Wenzhou and other special districts.
    The central tasks of this in-depth rural work are: to understand the ideological situation of farmers after agricultural cooperation, and strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership in rural areas; to mobilize farmers throughout the province to summarize the superiority of cooperatives and the advanced experience of high yields over the past year; to help disaster areas and cooperatives with seriously reduced income do a good job in production self-rescue and thrift to overcome difficulties; to study with farmers the methods of carrying out the agricultural production increase and thrift movement, and to lead farmers to do a good job in winter production.
    The personnel sent to the countryside by various departments will also study how to carry out the business work of each department, and guarantee and support the production increase and thrift movement from all aspects. For example, the finance and trade departments will study timely purchase and supply, and correct implementation of price policies; the financial sector will study grasping the recovery of agricultural loans and issuing necessary agricultural loans, in order to better support current production; the agricultural technology departments will study strengthening the transmission and promotion of advanced experience; the Rural Work Department, Propaganda Department, and Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee will study how to strengthen political education in rural areas, implement the experience of good harvests, and rectify the Party's grassroots organizations.
    When mobilizing government organ cadres to go to the countryside, the Provincial Party Committee pointed out: This time, the heads of various departments leading cadres to the countryside to do investigation and research work is not only to assist grassroots organizations in carrying out the production increase and thrift movement, but also an important measure to improve the style of leadership; the leaders of all departments of the Provincial Party Committee must spend seven to twelve weeks each year going deep into the lower levels, listening to the voices of the masses, and effectively changing the subjective and bureaucratic style of leadership organs that are divorced from reality and the masses.

    中共浙江省委和浙江省人民委员会
    抽调大批干部进行农村调查
    协助基层组织开展农业增产节约运动
    本报杭州5日电　中共浙江省委和浙江省人民委员会，最近抽调四百多机关干部深入农村进行调查研究工作，协助各级党政组织开展一个广泛的农业增产节约运动。中共浙江省委书记和部分省委委员率领的一批干部，已到达宁波、温州等专区。
    这次深入农村的中心任务是：摸清农业合作化后农民的思想情况，加强党对农村的政治思想领导；发动全省农民，总结一年来合作社的优越性和丰产的先进经验；帮助灾区和严重减少收入的社做好生产自救、节约度荒工作；同农民共同研究开展农业增产节约运动的办法，领导农民搞好冬季生产。
    各部门下乡人员还要研究如何开展各部门的业务工作，从各方面保证和支持增产节约运动。如财政贸易部门将研究及时收购、供应，正确执行价格政策；金融部门将研究抓紧收回农业贷款，发放必须发放的农业贷款，以便更好地支援当前生产；农业技术部门将研究加强对先进经验的传授和推广；省委农村工作部、宣传部、组织部将研究如何加强农村的政治教育工作、贯彻丰收经验和整顿党的基层组织等工作。
    省委在动员机关干部下乡的时候指出：这次各部门负责人带领干部下乡做调查研究工作，不仅是协助基层组织开展增产节约运动，而且也是改进领导作风的一项重要措施；省委各部门的领导人每年必须有七个星期到十二个星期深入下层，倾听群众呼声，切实有效地改变领导机关脱离实际、脱离群众的主观主义和官僚主义的作风。
