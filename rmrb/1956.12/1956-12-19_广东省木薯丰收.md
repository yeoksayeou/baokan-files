Guangdong Province Achieves Bumper Cassava Harvest

    (Our dispatch) The majority of the over 600,000 mu of cassava harvested this winter in Guangdong Province have yielded a bumper crop, with estimated general increases of 20-30% compared to last year. In the cassava-rich special districts of Gaoyao, Huiyang, and Zhanjiang, the yield is generally 1,500 to 2,500 jin per mu. In Xianjian Township's Sukeng Agricultural Cooperative in Dongguan County, the cooperative planted a total of 472 mu of cassava this year, with an average yield of over 3,000 jin per mu, and a maximum yield of over 6,000 jin.

    Cassava is a coarse grain crop suitable for subtropical growth, rich in starch. In addition to being used for human and animal consumption, it can also be used for textile sizing, alcohol production, pharmaceutical manufacturing, batteries, toothpaste, and other applications.

    广东省木薯丰收
    本报讯　广东省今年冬收的六十多万亩木薯大部丰收，估计一般可比去年增产两三成。盛产木薯的高要、惠阳、湛江等专区，每亩普遍产薯一千五百斤至二千五百斤。东莞县先建乡苏坑农业社，今年全社共种木薯四百七十二亩，平均每亩收薯三千多斤，最高达到六千多斤。
    木薯是适宜亚热带生长的杂粮作物，含有丰富的淀粉，除了可供人畜食用外，还可供纺织浆布、制造酒精、制药、电池、牙膏等用。
