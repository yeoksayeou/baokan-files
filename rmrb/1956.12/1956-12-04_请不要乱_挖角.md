　　Please Don't Randomly "Headhunt"

　　The folk professional Quyi (a traditional Chinese form of performance art) troupes in Beijing are currently facing an extremely vexing problem (which has been a recurring issue for the past few years since liberation, but this year the problem is particularly severe). This is the issue of various places "headhunting" from Beijing's folk professional Quyi troupes. It is our responsibility for Beijing's Quyi troupes to support other regions in organizing ballad singing groups. With formal procedures, inviting performers is acceptable, provided that the needs and interests of both parties are taken into consideration. However, some groups that come to invite performers do not follow reasonable procedures, but adopt the approach of "as long as we can get the talent, we don't mind spending more money."

　　For example, the Harbin People's Broadcasting Station sent people to Beijing to look for Quyi xiangsheng (cross-talk) performers. However, they neither contacted the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture nor the团委会 (League Committee) of relevant troupes, but instead used personal connections or师徒 (master-disciple) relationships to lure six performers from the Beijing Quyi Troupe Three to join their ballad singing group with more favorable remuneration and other conditions. The invited performers requested to withdraw from the troupe one after another, and two of them even left without saying goodbye. This matter was reported to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture, but has not been resolved to date.

　　When the Liaoning Song and Dance Troupe came to Beijing to invite performers, relevant parties had already introduced three performers to them. However, when the person they sent to Beijing Quyi Troupe contacted relevant matters, they disregarded the previous agreement and instead conducted side-way persuasion on a Shandong Kuaishu (a type of narrative singing) performer within the troupe. That performer then also requested to withdraw from the troupe. Furthermore, a certain male performer said that three units had invited him, promising him a certain amount of remuneration, etc., which also caused ideological fluctuations among other comrades in the troupe.

　　Two main actors from the Xinhua Quju Opera Troupe were also headhunted by the Changchun People's Broadcasting Station in September with high salaries.

　　The units that come to invite performers mostly target the backbone of each folk professional troupe. Moreover, these units that come to headhunt are mostly state-owned groups, with much better conditions. Therefore, when they come to folk professional troupes to invite performers, it causes great difficulties for the latter, not only affecting the development of folk professional troupes, but also directly affecting current work and operational issues. This type of problem also exists in Beijing opera, Ping opera and other opera troupes. Various places need talents in Quyi or opera, and Beijing has a relatively high concentration of such talents, which can be appropriately adjusted and arranged. However, the current "headhunting" approach is not a good approach. Should relevant authorities consider a reasonable solution?

### 请不要乱“挖角”

　  请不要乱“挖角”
    北京市的民间职业曲艺团体目前碰到了一个极为恼火的问题（这也是解放后几年来经常碰到的问题，不过今年这个问题来得特别严重），这就是各地纷纷到北京市各民间职业曲艺团体“挖角”的问题。各地组织说唱团体，我们北京市曲艺团体也有责任去支援。在照顾双方的需要和利益的前提下，通过正式手续，是可以约请演员的。可是有些来约演员的团体却不按合理的手续去办，而采取了“只要约好角，不怕多花钱”的办法。
    举例说吧：哈尔滨人民广播电台派人到北京来物色曲艺相声演员，但他们既不找北京市文化局，也不找有关团体的团委会，却通过私人关系或师徒关系，以较优厚的报酬等条件拉拢北京市曲艺三团的演员六人去参加他们的说唱团。被约的演员先后要求退团，其中有两个人竟不辞而别。此事呈报过北京市文化局，但迄未得到解决。
    辽宁省歌舞团到北京约演员，有关方面已给他们介绍了三位演员，可是他们派来的人到北京曲艺团联系有关事项时，竟抛开前约不谈，另对团内的一位山东快书演员进行了侧面动员，那位演员也就提出了退团要求。又有某男演员说，有三个单位约他，答应给他多少报酬等等，也引起了团内其他同志的思想动荡。
    新华曲剧团有两位主要演员也在9月份被长春人民广播电台以高薪约走。
    来约演员的各单位，所约对象大都是各民间职业剧团的骨干。而且这些来约角的单位，大都是国营团体，条件优越得多。因此，他们到民间职业剧团来约演员，就给后者造成了很大困难，不仅影响到民间职业剧团的发展，也直接影响到目前的工作和经营问题。这类问题，在京剧、评剧等戏曲团体中也存在。各地需要曲艺或戏曲方面的人材，而北京这类人材较为集中，这是可以适当地加以调整、安排的。但目前的这种“挖角”办法却不是好办法。有关主管部门是否应该考虑一个合理的解决办法呢？
