Xinhua News Agency report: Xi'an's local industrial enterprises completed the year's total output value plan a month ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by more than 6.9 million yuan. The total output value completed before the end of November this year increased by more than 30% compared to last year. The quality of products has also improved. For example, the paint's color is bright, overcoming the shortcomings of acid intolerance, non-insulation, and crepe paint not creping. Twenty-two factories that have implemented cost management reduced their costs by more than one-tenth in the first three quarters of this year compared to the same period last year, saving a total of more than 595,000 yuan. Six flour mills saved a total of 2.48 million kilograms of wheat in ten months this year due to increased flour yield.

    The main reason why Xi'an's local industry completed the total output value plan ahead of schedule this year is the promotion of dozens of advanced experiences, both large and small, and the adoption of more than 1,200 production reform proposals put forward by employees.

    西安地方工业超额生产近七百万元的产品
    据新华社讯　西安市地方工业企业提前一个月超额六百九十多万元完成了今年全年的总产值计划。今年11月底以前完成的总产值，就比去年提高了30％多。产品的质量也有所提高。如油漆的色泽鲜明，克服了不耐酸、不绝缘和绉纹漆不起绉的毛病。二十二个已经实行成本管理的工厂，今年一到三季度的成本比去年同期降低了十分之一多，共节约了五十九万五千多元。六个面粉厂因为提高了出粉率，今年十个月共节约了二百四十八万公斤小麦。
    今年西安市地方工业提前完成总产值计划的主要原因，是推广了大小几十种先进经验，和采纳了一千二百多件职工提出的生产改革建议。
