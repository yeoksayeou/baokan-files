Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, December 12th: Forestry workers in the Greater Khingan Mountains have completed this year's task of supplying timber for national construction ahead of schedule. From January to November this year, more than 50,000 railcars of timber were shipped from the Greater Khingan Mountains to all parts of the country. Hundreds of thousands of railway sleepers for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, which is under construction, were transported from the Greater Khingan Mountains. The supply of pit props to coal mines such as Kailuan reached more than 500,000 cubic meters, which can be used to mine more than 20 million tons of coal. Construction sites such as Baotou, Anshan Iron and Steel, and the Wuhan Bridge have all used a lot of timber produced in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area. This year, the timber supplied to the country increased by more than 60% compared to last year.
