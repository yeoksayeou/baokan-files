Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 18th -- According to TASS, representatives of the Soviet and Polish governments signed a treaty on December 17 concerning the legal status of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in Poland. This treaty was concluded based on the joint declaration signed in Moscow on November 18, 1956.

The treaty stipulates that the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Poland must not infringe upon Poland's national sovereignty and must not lead to the Soviet troops interfering in Poland's internal affairs.

The treaty stipulates that the number of Soviet troops temporarily stationed in Poland and their deployment locations will be determined according to a special agreement between the two governments. Within Poland, any movement of Soviet troops outside their designated areas requires the consent of the Polish government or its authorized state organs. Exercises and maneuvers by Soviet troops outside their designated locations will be conducted according to plans agreed upon with the Polish state organs or with the consent of the Polish government or its authorized state organs on each occasion.

Soviet troops stationed in Poland, the personnel within the Soviet troop establishment, and their families must respect and abide by Polish laws.

Military personnel of Soviet troops stationed in Poland will wear Soviet military uniforms and possess and carry weapons according to the Soviet military regulations. Automobiles and motorcycles of Soviet military units must have registered numbers and visible markings. The registered numbers and markings will be determined by the Soviet military command and notified to the competent Polish authorities. The Polish competent authorities recognize the validity of driver's licenses issued by the Soviet competent authorities to personnel within the Soviet troop establishment stationed in Poland, without the need for examination or payment of fees.

The procedures for Soviet military units and personnel within the Soviet troop establishment and their families to enter and leave Poland, issues related to their stay in Poland, and various corresponding documents will be determined by a special agreement between the contracting parties.

The procedures and regulations for the use of camps, airfields, training grounds, shooting ranges, and their equipment and installations, buildings, transportation and communication tools, electricity, public utilities, and trade facilities by the Soviet troops, including regulations for payment, will be determined by a special agreement between the competent authorities of the contracting parties.

The construction of houses, airfields, roads, bridges, and permanent radio communication buildings at the locations where Soviet troops are stationed, including the determination of their frequency and power, must be approved by the competent Polish state organs. Establishing permanent service stations for the personnel within the Soviet troop establishment outside the locations where Soviet troops are stationed also requires such approval.

When camps, airfields, training grounds, and shooting ranges, and their fixed equipment and installations used by Soviet troops are vacated, the above-mentioned objects shall be returned to the Polish authorities complete and undamaged. Issues concerning the transfer of objects no longer used by Soviet troops on Polish territory, including objects built by Soviet troops, to the Polish state organs will be determined by a special agreement.

The provisions of the treaty concerning jurisdiction stipulate that, as a general rule, Polish laws apply to cases of crimes or offenses committed by personnel within the Soviet troop establishment or their families in Poland, and they will be handled by Polish courts, procuratorates, and other competent Polish authorities authorized to prosecute crimes and offenses. Criminal cases involving Soviet military personnel will be investigated by the Polish Military Procuratorate and handled by the Polish military judicial organs.

However, personnel within the Soviet troop establishment or their families who commit crimes or offenses only against the Soviet Union or only against personnel within the Soviet troop establishment or their families; personnel within the Soviet troop establishment who commit crimes or offenses while performing official duties, are under the full jurisdiction of Soviet courts and other organs authorized by Soviet law.

The Soviet competent authorities and the Polish competent authorities may mutually request the transfer or acceptance of jurisdiction over the above-mentioned cases. Such requests will be considered in good faith.

Anyone who commits crimes against Soviet troops stationed in Poland and the military personnel within the Soviet troop establishment bears the same responsibility as those who commit crimes against the Polish armed forces and Polish military personnel.

The Soviet and Polish competent authorities will provide each other with various assistance, including legal assistance, when prosecuting the above-mentioned crimes and offenses. The principles and methods for providing such assistance will be stipulated in a special agreement between the contracting parties.

At the request of the Polish competent state organs, personnel within the Soviet troop establishment who have committed crimes that disrupt Polish legal order will be recalled from Poland to their home country.

The Soviet government agrees to compensate the Polish government for material losses suffered by the Polish state due to the actions or negligence of Soviet troop units or individuals within the Soviet troop establishment, as well as losses caused to Polish organs and citizens or to citizens of third countries in Poland while performing official duties, the amount of which will be determined by a joint commission established under this treaty based on the requests made and taking into account Polish legal provisions.

Disputes that may arise due to the obligations of Soviet troop units will also be handled by the joint commission according to the same principles.

The Soviet government also agrees to compensate the Polish government for losses caused to Polish organs, citizens, or citizens of third countries in Poland due to actions or negligence by personnel within the Soviet troop establishment not acting in the course of official duties, and due to the actions or negligence of their families, the amount of compensation to be determined by the competent Polish courts based on the demands made against those who caused the losses.

The Soviet side will compensate for the losses within three months from the date the joint commission makes a decision or the court ruling takes effect.

Requests for compensation for losses that have not been satisfied before the entry into force of this treaty will be handled by the joint commission.

The Polish government agrees to compensate the Soviet government for losses suffered by the property of Soviet troop units stationed in Poland and by personnel within the Soviet troop establishment due to the actions or negligence of Polish state organs, the amount of which will be determined by the joint commission based on the requests made and taking into account Polish legal provisions.

Disputes that may arise with respect to the obligations undertaken by Polish state organs towards Soviet troop units will also be examined by the joint commission on a unified basis.

The Polish government also agrees to compensate the Soviet government for losses suffered by Soviet troop units stationed in Poland, personnel within the Soviet troop establishment, and their families due to the actions or negligence of Polish citizens, the amount of which will be determined by the Polish courts based on the demands made against those who caused the losses.

The treaty stipulates that the routes, times, methods, and payment terms for Soviet troops and military property transiting through Polish territory, as well as military transportation within Poland, will be stipulated in a special agreement.

In order to properly handle issues that arise from time to time in connection with the stationing of Soviet troops in Poland, the Soviet and Polish governments will appoint plenipotentiary representatives responsible for the affairs of the stationing of Soviet troops in Poland.

A Soviet-Polish joint commission will be established to resolve issues related to the interpretation or application of this treaty and the agreements stipulated by this treaty. The Soviet-Polish joint commission will be composed of three representatives appointed by each of the contracting parties. The address will be in Warsaw. If the joint commission cannot resolve the issues submitted to it, these issues will be resolved through diplomatic channels in the shortest possible time.

    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社华沙讯：苏联和波兰两国政府代表17日签订了关于暂时驻在波兰的苏联军队的法律地位的条约。这个条约是根据1956年11月18日在莫斯科签署的联合声明缔结的。
    条约规定，苏联军队在波兰的暂时驻扎决不能触犯波兰国家的主权，决不能导致苏联军队干涉波兰的内政。
    条约规定，暂时留驻波兰的苏军人数及其驻扎地点，将根据两国政府特别协定确定。在波兰境内，苏军在其驻扎地区以外的调动每次都需取得波兰政府的同意或它的全权政权机关的同意。苏军在其驻扎地点以外的操练和演习，需根据同波兰政权机关商定的计划进行或者每次取得波兰政府或它的全权政权机关的同意进行。
    驻扎波兰境内的苏军、苏军编制以内的人员及其家属必须尊重和遵守波兰的法令。
    驻扎波兰境内的苏军军人穿着苏军服装，按照苏军规定的制度持有和配带武器。苏军部队的汽车和机器脚踏车须具有登记的号码和显明的标志。登记的号码和标志由苏军司令部规定，并通知波兰主管机关。波兰主管机关承认苏联主管机关发给驻波兰境内的苏军编制内的人员的驾驶证有效，不须试验或交款。
    苏军部队和苏军编制以内的人员及其家属进入波兰和离开波兰的办法、有关他们驻在波兰境内的问题以及各种相应的文件由缔约双方的专门协定加以确定。

    在苏军的驻扎地点建造房屋、机场、道路、桥梁和永久性的无线电通讯建筑物，包括确定其频率和功率，都要经波兰主管政权机关的同意。在苏军驻扎地点以外为苏军编制内的人员设置永久性的生活服务站，也要取得这种同意。
    在苏军所使用的营地、机场、教练场和打靶场及其固定设备和装置空出时，上述对象都应完整无损地归还波兰当局。有关把在波兰领土上的苏军不使用了的对象、包括苏军建筑的对象移交给波兰政权机关的问题，将由专门协定加以确定。
    条约中有关裁判权问题的条款规定，关于苏军编制以内的人员或其家属在波兰境内的犯罪或过失案件，作为一般规则，适用波兰法律，并且由波兰法院、检察院和有权起诉罪行和过失的其他波兰主管机关处理。苏军军人犯罪案件由波兰军事检察院调查，并由波兰军法机关受理。
    但是，苏军编制以内的人员或他们的家属只对苏联以及只对苏军编制以内的人员或他们的家属犯罪或犯过失者；苏军编制以内的人员在执行公务的时候犯罪或犯过失者，归苏联法院和苏联法律授权的其他机关全权处理。
    苏联主管机关和波兰主管机关可以互相请求移交或接受上述各案件的裁判权。这种请求将得到善意的考虑。
    凡对驻扎波兰境内的苏军以及苏军编制以内的军人犯罪时，犯罪者负有同对波兰武装部队和波兰军人犯罪的同样责任。
    苏联和波兰两国主管机关在就上述的犯罪和过失提出起诉时将互相给以各种帮助，包括法律帮助。提供这种帮助的原则和办法由缔约双方的专门协定规定。
    根据波兰主管政权机关的请求，犯有破坏波兰法律秩序罪行的苏军编制以内的人员将被从波兰召回本国。
    由于苏军部队或者苏军部队编制内的个人的行动或者疏忽而使波兰国家遭受的物质损失以及他们在执行公务时给波兰机关和公民或者在波兰境内的第三国公民所造成的损失，苏联政府同意给予波兰政府赔偿，其数额都由根据本条约所成立的联合委员会在所提出的要求的基础上和考虑到波兰的法律规定的情况下加以确定。
    由于苏联部队的义务而可能产生的争执也由联合委员会根据同样的原则处理。
    苏联政府还同意赔偿波兰政府由于苏军编制以内的人员非因公务而作的行动或疏忽，以及由于他们的家属的行动或疏忽给波兰机关、公民或者给在波兰境内的第三国公民所造成的损失，赔偿数额由波兰主管法院根据对造成损失的人所提出的要求来确定。
    苏联方面将在联合委员会作出决定或是法院裁决生效之日起三个月内赔偿损失。
    在本条约生效之前尚未得到满足的关于赔偿损失的要求将由联合委员会处理。
    对于驻扎波兰境内的苏军部队的财产和苏军编制内的人员由于波兰国家机关的行动或者疏忽而受到的损失，波兰政府同意给予苏联政府赔偿，其数额由联合委员会在所提出的要求的基础上和考虑到波兰的法律规定的情况下加以确定。
    在波兰国家机关对苏军部队承担的义务方面可能产生的争执也归联合委员会在统一基础上审查。
    对于驻扎波兰境内的苏军部队、苏军编制内的人员及其家属由于波兰公民的行动或者疏忽而遭受的损失，波兰政府也同意给予苏联政府赔偿，其数额由波兰法院根据向造成损失的人所提出的要求加以确定。
    条约规定，苏军和军队财产假道波兰领土的路线、时间、方式和支付费用条件以及在波兰境内的军事运输将由专门协定加以规定。
    为了妥善处理同苏军驻扎波兰有关的随时发生的问题，苏联政府和波兰政府将任命负责苏军驻扎波兰事务的全权代表。
    成立苏波联合委员会以解决有关解释或使用本条约和本条约所规定的协定的问题，苏波联合委员会由缔约双方各委派三名代表组成。地址设在华沙。如果联合委员会不能解决交给它的问题，这一问题将通过外交途径在最短期内求得解决。
