Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, December 8th. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is currently building highways to the primitive forests of the Tianshan Mountains in four locations. These four forest area highways, respectively, extend from the trunk highways in Jinghe, Anjihai, Hutubi, and Qitai, etc., on the northern side of the Tianshan Mountains, towards the Tianshan forest area. They are over 400 kilometers in total length and are expected to be completed in March next year.

The central section of the Tianshan Mountains is covered with dense spruce and red pine forests. The forest area stretches for hundreds of kilometers and is the main forest area of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. In the past, there was no planned logging. After these forest area highways are completed, the rich forest resources in the central section of the Tianshan Mountains can be developed in a planned way. The harvested timber will meet the needs of industrial and urban construction in the Autonomous Region.

　　公路通向天山原始林区
    新华社乌鲁木齐8日电　新疆维吾尔自治区正在四个地方修建通向天山原始森林的公路。这四条林区公路，分别从天山北面的精河、安集海、呼图壁和奇台等地的公路干线通向天山林区，共长四百多公里，预计在明年3月完工。
    天山中段生长着茂密的云杉、红松。林区绵延几百公里，是新疆维吾尔自治区的主要林区，过去从没有进行过有计划的采伐。这些林区公路修通后，天山中段丰富的森林资源就能进行有计划的开发。采伐的木材将供应自治区工业建设和城市建设的需要。
