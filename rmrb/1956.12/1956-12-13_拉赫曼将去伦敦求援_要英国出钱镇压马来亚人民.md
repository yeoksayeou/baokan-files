Xinhua News Agency, December 12th, Kuala Lumpur Dispatch: Malayan Federation Chief Minister Abdul Rahman announced on December 10th that he would be going to London on the 12th. He said he would be asking Britain to continue to pay for the war to suppress the Malayan National Liberation Army after the Malayan Federation declared independence.

He said that Malaya spends 150 million Malayan dollars annually on this war, and he will ask the British government to bear half of it.

Rahman said that Malaya will expand its armed forces, and until the armed forces are fully expanded, it will continue to rely on the British and other Commonwealth countries' troops to carry out this war.

He also said that while in London, he will conduct negotiations on the conclusion of a "defense and mutual assistance treaty," and he will ask Britain to continue to maintain its current strength of fifteen battalions of troops in Malaya.

(Editor's Note) In February of this year, the Malayan Federation and Britain signed a report on the negotiations between the two countries in London. Britain was forced to agree that "the Malayan Federation should declare complete autonomy and independence within the Commonwealth before August 1957, if possible." The report stipulated the formation of an "Emergency Operations Committee" to continue the war to suppress the Malayan National Liberation Movement. The Malayan Federation authorities held peace talks with the Malayan Communist Party in Hua Leng last December to end the war, but they did not achieve results due to British obstruction. In April of this year, Rahman rejected the Malayan Communist Party's proposal to resume negotiations to end the war, which would be conducive to the struggle for genuine independence.

    拉赫曼将去伦敦求援
    要英国出钱镇压马来亚人民
    新华社12日电　吉隆坡消息：马来亚联合邦首席部长阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼12月10日宣布，他将在12日前往伦敦。他说，他将要求英国在马来亚联合邦宣告独立以后继续出钱来进行镇压马来亚民族解放军的战争。
    他说，马来亚在这场战争上每年花费马来亚币一亿五千万元，他将要求英国政府负担一半。
    拉赫曼说，马来亚将扩大它的武装部队，而在武装部队充分扩大之前，它将继续依靠英国和英联邦其他国家的军队来进行这场战争。
    他又说，在伦敦的时候，他将进行关于缔结一项“防御和互助条约”的谈判，他将要求英国继续在马来亚保持目前的十五营军队的实力。
    （编者注）今年2月，马来亚联合邦同英国在伦敦签署了两国谈判的报告，英国被迫同意“应当在1957年8月以前宣布马来亚联合邦实行在英联邦范围内的完全自治和独立，如果可能的话”。报告规定组成“紧急作战委员会”，继续进行镇压马来亚民族解放运动的战争。马来亚联合邦当局曾在去年12月在华冷同马来亚共产党举行结束战争的和平谈判，但由于英国的阻挠，未获结果。今年4月，拉赫曼拒绝了马来亚共产党关于恢复谈判，以结束战争，俾有利于争取真正独立的斗争的建议。
