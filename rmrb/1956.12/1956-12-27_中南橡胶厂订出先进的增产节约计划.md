	Zhongnan Rubber Factory Formulates Advanced Production Increase and Economy Plan
	Increasing total output value by 61% compared to this year without requiring more raw materials, increasing workers, or adding to basic construction investment, all while guaranteeing product quality.
	(Our newspaper dispatch) The Zhongnan Rubber Factory, which completed its Five-Year Plan thirteen months ahead of schedule, fully tapped the potential of the enterprise when arranging next year's production. Without asking the state for more raw materials, increasing the labor force, and even reducing basic construction investment by more than 400,000 yuan, the total output value next year will still increase by 61% compared to this year.
	The factory recently compiled a draft plan for increasing production and practicing economy (including the production plan). According to this draft, the output of various major products will increase significantly next year. Canvas shoes will increase by 430,000 pairs compared to this year, bladders and rubber cloth will increase by more than 75,000 kilograms, and various types of rubber tubes will increase by 6.5 times. The profit earned from products produced by saving rubber can increase the amount submitted to the state by 250,000 yuan next year. Technical organizational measures to ensure the completion of various production increase tasks have also been drafted, and will be submitted to the staff and workers for discussion and implementation along with the draft plan for increasing production and practicing economy.
	For the past half-month or so, the factory's leaders have organized the heads of various sections and workshops to calculate the technical equipment capacity, working hours, raw material consumption quotas, labor organization, design formulas, etc. of the entire enterprise, and comprehensively and systematically checked the implementation of this year's production, financial, and cost plans, discovering that the enterprise has great potential. The draft plan for increasing production and practicing economy and the technical organizational measures plan of this factory were formulated on the basis of investigating and analyzing the potential of the enterprise and considering positive factors. Taking the rubber mixing workshop as an example, next year it will continue to promote the M-mother rubber mixing method that was successfully tested this year, further improve operations, and balance some equipment. The working hours saved can not only meet the needs of increased production, but also produce more than 34,000 additional components. In terms of saving raw materials, this year, large-sized canvas shoes have implemented the central formula and the "seven-section sole" design, saving 18 tons of rubber. Next year, the formula design for small and medium-sized canvas shoes will also widely promote these experiences, reducing rubber consumption by 5 centimeters per pair. At the same time, the rubber sole formula will be improved, reducing the raw rubber content from 30% to 10%. In this way, a total of more than 27 tons of rubber can be saved throughout the year. Together with the rubber saved from inventory this year and the state's allocation, next year it will be possible to produce a large number of products without asking the state for more rubber raw materials. Considering the favorable conditions of new workers entering the factory this year to learn about technological progress, the factory believes it can avoid increasing the number of workers, even as production tasks increase
	The measures proposed by the Zhongnan Rubber Factory are based on a solid and reliable foundation. For example, measures such as saving rubber mixing working hours and improving formulas to reduce rubber content have recently been tested one after another, with good results. The factory leaders have also organized technicians and management personnel from various sections and workshops to carefully assess and appraise the current measures, while also considering the difficulties that may be encountered during implementation and proposing corresponding solutions.
	In addition, the Zhongnan Factory also carefully considered the issue of ensuring product quality. Any measures that may affect quality will not be adopted. In order to improve product quality, the rubber mixing time for raw rubber will also be appropriately extended next year to ensure its wear resistance and plasticity.

    中南橡胶厂订出先进的增产节约计划
    不多要原材料，不增加工人，削减基本建设投资，在保证产品质量原则下，明年的生产总值比今年增加61％
    本报讯　提前十三个月完成了五年计划的中南橡胶厂，在安排明年生产时，充分挖掘企业潜力，在不向国家多要原材料，不增加劳动力，并且削减了四十多万元基本建设投资后，明年的总产值仍将比今年增长61％。
    这个厂最近编制出了增产节约计划（包括生产计划）草案。根据这个草案，明年各种主要产品产量都有显著增加，布面胶鞋较今年增加四十三万双，球胆、胶布等增加七万五千多公斤，各型胶管增加六点五倍。用节约的橡胶增产的产品所获的利润，明年可多上缴二十五万元。保证各项增产任务的技术组织措施，也已拟定了出来，将连同增产节约计划草案交职工讨论贯彻。
    近半个多月来，这个厂的领导人员组织各科室、车间负责人核算了整个企业的技术设备能力、工时、原材料消耗定额、劳动组织、设计配方等，全面、系统地检查了今年的生产、财务、成本计划执行情况，发现企业存在很大的潜在力量。这个厂的增产节约计划草案和技术组织措施计划就是在调查分析企业潜力和考虑到积极因素的基础上制定出来的。以炼胶车间为例，明年继续推广今年试验成功的M母炼胶法，再改善操作和平衡部分设备，节省出的工时，不仅可以满足增产需要，而且还可以多出三万四千多台分。在节约原材料方面，今年大号布面胶鞋推行了中央配方、“七段大底”设计等，结余了橡胶十八吨，明年的小、中号胶鞋配方设计也普遍推行这些经验，每双可降低橡胶消耗五公分；同时改进胶底配方，把生胶含量由30％降到10％，这样全年共可节约橡胶二十七吨以上，加上今年节约的库存胶和国家的分配额，明年便可以不向国家多要橡胶原料，而增产大量产品。随着生产任务增大所需的劳动力，厂里考虑到今年新进厂学工的技术进步这一有利条件，明年可以不增加一个工人。
    中南橡胶厂提出的这些措施是建立在切实可靠的基础上的。如节约炼胶工时、改进配方降低橡胶含量等措施，最近都相继进行了试验，效果良好；厂的领导又组织了技术人员、科室车间管理人员对现行的措施进行了仔细的考核、鉴定，同时还考虑到执行中可能碰到的困难，提出了相应的解决办法。
    此外，中南厂还认真地考虑了保证产品质量的问题。凡是可能影响质量的措施就不采用。为了提高产品质量，生胶的炼胶时间，明年还将适当延长，以保证它的耐磨、可塑性能。
