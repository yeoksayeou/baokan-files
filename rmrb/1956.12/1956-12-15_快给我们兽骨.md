    Quickly Give Us Animal Bones

    Bone glue is an industrial raw material used for bonding. The North China Bone Glue Factory in Tianjin, with a history of over 40 years, produces bone glue that is sold to domestic match, woodworking, dyeing, ink making, pencil, musical instrument, and sandpaper industries, and has also received good reviews in countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy, Belgium, and Indonesia. However, the production of the North China Bone Glue Factory is currently facing significant difficulties: a lack of animal bone raw materials.

    Originally, the National Miscellaneous Bone Procurement Conference in May 1955 had already defined the regional scope for procuring miscellaneous bones, clarifying that the procurement of miscellaneous bones should be uniformly controlled by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, with local cooperatives responsible for collection and supply. Therefore, the supply of miscellaneous bones was basically stable in 1955. However, since this year, many localities, in order to solve the problem of fertilizer for agricultural production, have established small-scale bone meal factories one after another, procuring animal bones beyond their regions and directly using animal bones to produce bone meal. This has affected the factory's lack of raw materials, resulting in work stoppages and reduced production, and also wasting a large amount of gelatin in the animal bones. Each ton of animal bones can produce 0.15 tons of glue, and if animal bones are directly used to produce bone meal, all of this gelatin is wasted.

    Conversely, the degelatinized bone meal, a byproduct of animal bones after glue extraction, has a phosphorus content value equivalent to that of bone meal directly produced from the same amount of animal bones, and does not affect agricultural fertilizer. I hope that localities will not blindly construct small-scale bone meal factories that waste animal bones, and suggest that relevant central departments convene a meeting to determine the regions for supplying miscellaneous bones and the agencies responsible for the supply.

### 快给我们兽骨

    快给我们兽骨
    骨胶是用来粘合的工业原料。有四十多年历史的天津华北骨胶厂生产的骨胶，行销于国内火柴、木器制造、浆染、制墨、铅笔、乐器、砂纸等工业部门，在英国、意大利、比利时、印度尼西亚等国也有好评。可是目前华北骨胶厂的生产却遇到很大的困难：缺乏兽骨原料。
    本来1955年5月全国杂骨采购会议已经划定了采购杂骨的地区范围，明确了杂骨采购由全国合作总社统一掌握，由各地合作社担负收购、供应任务。因此，杂骨供应情况在1955年基本上是稳定的。可是今年以来，许多地方为了解决农业生产的肥料问题，纷纷建立小型骨粉厂，超越地区采购兽骨，用兽骨直接制造骨粉。这就影响了我厂原料不够用，停工减产，而且也浪费了兽骨中大量的胶质。每吨兽骨能制胶零点一五吨，用兽骨直接制造骨粉，这些胶就都浪费了。
    反之，兽骨在提胶之后的副产品脱胶骨粉，含磷价值和同等数量兽骨直接产制的骨粉相当，并不影响农肥。我希望各地不要盲目建设浪费兽骨的小型骨粉厂，并建议中央有关部门召开会议，确定杂骨供应地区和负责供应的机关。
