    A Stillborn Official Document
    Bu Ping
    Recently, after studying several documents on opposing subjectivism and bureaucratism, I couldn't help but recall an official document that was only recently processed. This document took a total of one hundred and two days to complete. Now, I might as well expose it:
    On May 30th, the higher authorities issued a notice regarding carrying out investigation and research work on the production and sales of agricultural products. Our unit's receiving and dispatching office received it on June 5th, marked it to be handled by the ×× department, and first presented it to Chief × for review.
    On June 6th, Chief × signed it and handed it over to the office.
    On June 7th, the office presented the document to Deputy Chief × for review and approval.
    On June 8th, Deputy Chief × approved it with "Quickly draft a plan and arrange for an investigation."
    On the same day, the office's general receiving and dispatching department sent this document to the ×× department's receiving and dispatching office. The department's receiving and dispatching office presented the document to the department head for review and approval.
    The department head instructed on the same day: "Comrade Xiao Liu, please take charge of handling this."
    On June 18th, a small group meeting of relevant personnel was held to discuss and study the initial draft prepared by Comrade Xiao Liu.
    On June 25th, a meeting of all comrades in the department was convened for discussion.
    On July 14th, a forum was held with responsible comrades from relevant departments to discuss and study the issue of drawing people from relevant units to cooperate.
    On July 23rd, the plan was formally drafted and submitted to the chief for review.
    On July 25th, the chief signed and sealed it, and handed it over to the office for printing.
    On August 3rd, it was submitted to the purchasing business managers meeting of various counties (cities) for discussion and was basically approved.
    On August 14th, revisions were made based on the meeting's discussions, and an urgent official document was drafted and submitted to the local statistics bureau for approval.
    On August 16th, Deputy Chief × signed his opinion on the corner of the document, saying: "Submit it to the ×× Committee for discussion and approval before submitting it for approval."
    On August 23rd, Chief × signed and issued it, and noted: "I think it is not necessary for the ×× Committee to discuss and approve it."
    On September 3rd, the provincial statistics bureau replied, "Agreed, and made some revisions to certain content."
    On September 14th, the formal notice was finally issued: All localities should, in accordance with this investigation and research plan and combined with the actual situation of their localities, draft a specific plan for carrying out investigation and research work in your county, submit it to the local statistics and financial and trade departments for approval, and then quickly carry out investigation and research work. It is also required that all localities compile and sort out the survey forms and materials from mid-September to the end of October, repeatedly verify them, and report them.
    Heavens! When the remote areas received this document, it was already late September. Moreover, it was the peak season, with a large number of agricultural products entering the market. To complete the investigation and research work on the two-year output, output value, commodity volume, and purchase volume of nearly two hundred kinds of agricultural products in such a short period of time, even with the greatest ability, it would be impossible to complete it on schedule. What if they, like us, spend another one hundred and two days drafting a plan? What would be the consequences then?

    一件难产的公文
    不平
    最近学习了有关反对主观主义、官僚主义的几个文件，不禁想起不久前才办出的一件公文。这件公文共办了一百零二天，现在我不妨将它揭露一下：
    上级5月30日发出关于开展农产品产销情况调查研究工作的通知，本单位收发室6月5日接到，批××处办，并先呈×首长阅。
    6月6日×首长签字后交办公室。
    6月7日办公室将此文再呈×副首长阅批。
    ×副首长6月8日批“速写一方案，布置调查”。
    当日办公室总收发将此文送到××处收发，处收发将此文呈处长阅批。
    处长于当日批示“小刘同志，负责办理”。
    6月18日召开有关人员小组会讨论研究小刘同志拟出的初稿。
    6月25日召集全处同志讨论。
    7月14日召集有关部门负责同志座谈，并讨论研究各有关单位抽人配合问题。
    7月23日正式拟出方案，呈首长审查。
    7月25日首长签印，交办公室打印。
    8月3日交各县（市）采购业务经理会议上讨论基本通过。
    8月14日根据会议讨论作了修改，拟出急件公文，报请当地统计局批准。
    8月16日×副首长在该文角上签署意见说：“提请××会讨论通过后再报批”。
    8月23日×首长签发，并注明“我意不必××会讨论通过了”。
    9月3日省统计局批复“同意，并对某些内容作了修改意见”。
    9月14日始发出正式通知：各地按此调查研究方案，结合当地实际情况，拟出你县具体调查研究工作开展方案，报请当地统计、财贸部门同意后迅速开展调查研究工作，并要求各地于9月中旬开始至10月下旬以前将调查表及资料汇编整理，反复核实后上报。
    天哪，当边远地区接到此文时已是9月下旬了，再加之那时正是业务旺季，大量农产品上市，要求在这样短的时间内，完成近二百种农产品的二个年度产量、产值、商品量和采购量的调查研究工作，即使有天大的本领，也是无法按期完成的。万一他们也像我们一样再来个一百零二天拟出一个方案的话，那后果又该怎样呢？
