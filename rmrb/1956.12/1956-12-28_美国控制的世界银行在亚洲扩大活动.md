Xinhua News Agency, December 26th dispatch from Washington: The World Bank, controlled by the United States, recently announced that in 1956 it provided $507.4 million in loans to seventeen countries. Asian countries (India, Burma, Japan, and Thailand) received the most loans, totaling $150.1 million.

Agence France-Presse also quoted reliable sources as saying that next year (1957) the World Bank will continue to be "most actively concerned with Asian countries financially." In this regard, it is believed that there is a possibility of increasing loans to India.

Reports indicate that loans to Pakistan will increase significantly in the coming years. At the same time, the bank is also prepared to continue providing "assistance" to Japan.

(Editor's Note) The "World Bank," namely the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is one of the specialized agencies that has established relations with the United Nations. This bank was established in December 1945, and its purpose, as stipulated, is to "facilitate the exchange of international production funds" and "restore and develop the economies of countries or backward regions damaged by war." However, because the majority of the bank's shares are held by the United States, it has in practice become a tool manipulated by the U.S. government's so-called "National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems" to assist the United States in exporting capital and engaging in economic expansion. In its early days, the bank's main task was to cooperate with the U.S. "Marshall Plan." In recent years, in accordance with the U.S. "Point Four Program," the bank has gradually shifted its focus to economically backward regions.

    美国控制的世界银行在亚洲扩大活动
    据新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：受美国控制的世界银行最近宣布，它在1956年给了十七个国家以五亿零七百四十万美元的贷款。其中亚洲国家（印度、缅甸、日本和泰国）得到的贷款最多，共达一亿五千零十万美元。
    法新社还引可靠人士的话说，明年（1957年）世界银行将继续“在财政上最为积极地关心亚洲国家”。在这方面，人们认为有可能增加对印度的贷款。
    有消息说，在未来的几年中给巴基斯坦的贷款将大大增加。同时，这个银行也准备对日本继续提供“援助”。
    （编者注）“世界银行”，即国际复兴开发银行，是与联合国建立关系的专门机构之一。这个银行成立于1945年12月，其宗旨按规定是“便利国际生产资金之交流”和“恢复并开发受战争破坏的国家或落后地区之经济”。但是，由于这个银行的股份大部分都掌握在美国手中，因此它在实际上就成为在美国政府的所谓“国际货币金融问题国家咨询委员会”操纵下协助美国输出资本、进行经济扩张的工具。这个银行在成立初期，主要任务是配合美国“马歇尔计划”进行活动。近年来，这个银行又根据美国的“第四点计划”，把活动的重点逐渐转到经济落后地区。
