    Xinjiang Cement Plant Party Committee Rarely Asks About Production
    Output Falls Short of Plan Every Month, Quality Fails to Improve Long-Term
    Urumqi Dispatch from our newspaper – The Chinese Communist Party's Xinjiang Cement Plant Committee has relaxed its leadership over the enterprise, causing losses in production. Since the second quarter, the plant has not completed its production plan in any month, and the problem of low cement quality has not been resolved for a long time.
    For a long time, the plant's Party Committee has been unclear about the tasks of the Party organization in factories and mining enterprises. Some things that the Party Committee did not need to handle were handled by it, while some work that the Party Committee needed to do was not done, or was not done well. In the second half of this year, when the plant carried out wage reform and investigated the living welfare of employees, the Party Committee did not divide the work well with the administration and the trade union. Everyone was busy managing employee accommodation, food, and drinking water, but rarely studied major production issues and the ideological education of employees. In the second and third quarters of this year, the planned target for the hourly output of ball mills was set too high, and the actual output differed greatly from the planned output. Many employees had opinions, but the Party Committee did not study the matter with the administration in a timely manner, which affected the employees' production morale. Regarding the reasons for the low cement quality, the engineering and technical personnel believed it was a technical management issue, the administrative leaders believed it was a technical issue, and the employees believed that the plant's equipment was old and the working conditions were poor. The Party Committee also did not conduct sufficient research within the Party, so the cement quality has not been improved. The Party Committee has no plan for what problems to solve in each period, what meetings to hold, etc. Party Committee members often only know the meeting agenda when the meeting starts. When meetings are held, only a few people speak. Some of the issues discussed by the Party Committee or the decisions made are not conveyed to the Party branches in each workshop for full discussion by employees, causing the Party Committee to become detached from the masses, and the Party Committee's decisions cannot be transformed into the strength of the masses.

    新疆水泥厂党委很少过问生产
    产量月月完不成计划，质量长期得不到改进
    本报乌鲁木齐电　中共新疆水泥厂委员会放松了对企业的领导，使生产受到损失。从第二季度到现在，这个厂没有一个月完成生产计划，水泥质量不高的问题，也长期得不到解决。
    这个厂的党委会，长期以来，对党组织在厂矿企业中的任务不明确，有些事情本来不需要党委去办，但是它去办了，有些工作需要党委去做的，反而没有去做，或者做的不好。今年下半年，厂内进行工资改革和调查职工生活福利，党委会没很好地和行政、工会分工，大家都忙着去管职工住宿、吃饭、喝水，对生产上的重大问题和职工群众的思想教育工作却很少研究。今年二、三季度，球磨机每小时产量计划指标订的过高，实际达到数和计划数相差悬殊，许多职工有意见，党委没有及时和行政研究，结果影响了职工的生产情绪。对水泥质量不高的原因，工程技术人员认为是技术管理问题，行政领导认为是技术问题，而职工们认为是本厂设备旧，劳动条件不好。党委也没有在党内进行充分的研究，结果水泥质量一直提不高。党委在每个时期要解决些什么问题，开些什么会议等，没有计划。党委委员们往往是到开会时才知道会议议题，开起会来，发言的只是少数人。党委会讨论的一些问题或者作出的决定，没有下达到各个车间党支部，让职工充分讨论，使党委和群众脱了节，党委的决定不能变成群众的力量。
