    Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory

    Organizes Workers to Evaluate Advanced Experiences

    (Our Newspaper News) The Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory began organizing workers to evaluate various advanced experiences promoted over the past few years in October. After preliminary evaluation by all fifteen workshops, ninety-eight types of advanced experiences that are practical and feasible in their factory have been identified, generally increasing efficiency by one to three times.

    In the past, the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory had significant blind spots and a tendency to mechanically copy when promoting advanced experiences. As a result, some advanced experiences that were not suitable for the factory's circumstances were forced to be promoted, while good experiences within the factory were not given enough attention. After this evaluation, it was discovered that some advanced experiences, such as high-speed cutting methods, had already been mastered by the majority of the workers and incorporated into operating procedures, so the issue was no longer promotion but improvement. Some advanced experiences, such as the electric furnace utilization of waste steel shavings method and the cupola furnace utilization of waste iron shavings method, had basically the same technical principles and operating procedures. Learning one would allow understanding of the other, eliminating the need to promote both simultaneously and wasting manpower and resources. Some advanced experiences, such as the Su Changyou bricklaying method, could not be promoted because there was no bricklaying task, or they were only suitable for individual or specific types of work. It was confirmed that these would no longer be included in the promotion plan. Some advanced experiences, such as the electro-spark strengthening tool method, were not suitable for the factory's production conditions and should not be promoted. Only after this evaluation was the reason found, and they were boldly rejected. Many advanced experiences have been developed into completely new things after being learned by the factory's workers. For example, the boiler burning low-value coal method has evolved from burning low-value coal to burning sawdust and waste materials, ensuring a normal steam supply and saving 30 tons of coal per month. Some advanced experiences, after repeated comparisons, were not as good as some of the factory's workers' operating methods and were replaced by the factory's own experiences.

    Various advanced operating methods that have long been used by workers but have been neglected have been summarized as advanced experiences for comprehensive promotion through this evaluation. For example, lathe operator He Tingqian created a new rapid thread-cutting method based on the Bilyukov thread-picking method, which increased production efficiency by eleven times and became a model for all lathe operators to learn from.

    太原机车车辆修理工厂
    组织职工鉴定先进经验
    本报讯　太原机车车辆修理工厂10月份开始组织职工群众对几年来推广的各项先进经验进行鉴定。全厂十五个车间经过初步鉴定，已经鉴别九十八种，在他们厂里是切实可行的先进经验，效率一般都提高了一至三倍。
    太原机车车辆修理工厂过去推广先进经验，存在着很大的盲目性和生搬硬套的缺点，以致有些先进经验本来不适合本厂情况，也要硬来推广，而对本厂的好经验，却不够重视。经过这次鉴定，发现有些先进经验，像高速切削法，已为广大群众所掌握，并且列入了操作规程，就不再是推广而是提高的问题了。有些先进经验，如电炉利用废钢屑法和化铁炉利用废铁屑法，技术原理和操作过程基本上相同，只要学会了一种就可以懂得另一种，不必同时推行，造成人力、物力的浪费。有些先进经验，如苏长有砌砖法、不是没有砌砖的任务，不能推广，就是适合个别人或是个别工种使用，这次也肯定不再列入推广计划。有些先进经验，像电火花强刀具法、不适合本厂生产状况，不宜推行，这次鉴定才找出原因，大胆地否定了。有不少先进经验，经过本厂职工学习，已经发展成为完全新的东西。比如锅炉烧用低值煤法、由烧低值煤发展到烧锯末、烂材废料，保证了正常的蒸气供应，每月还可以节省煤三十吨。有些先进经验，经过反复比较，不如本厂一些工人的操作方法优越，就以本厂的经验代替了。
    工人中久已采用，但一直被人忽视的各种先进操作方法，经过这次鉴定，总结成为全面推行的先进经验。如车工贺廷牵在比留科夫挑扣法的基础上，创造了一种新的快速挑扣法，生产效率提高了十一倍，变成全体车工学习的榜样。（石生）
