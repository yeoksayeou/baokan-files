Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 29th: Today's Indonesian "People's Daily" revealed that the United States is blatantly interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs.

The newspaper said that during the period when the rebellious Simbolon gained power, planes belonging to Claire Chennault, an American veteran who ran an airline in Taiwan, landed in North Sumatra. Those who arrived there on Chennault's planes promised to aid Simbolon on the condition that they would guarantee American oil interests in North Sumatra, at least to the same extent as Dutch oil interests were guaranteed.

The newspaper also cited the fact that U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr. Cumming, once told Cabinet Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo that the United States might recognize Simbolon's regime.

The "People's Daily" pointed out that the rebellious military conspiracy group had connections with the United States when plotting to launch a coup. The newspaper reminded everyone not to forget that Allen Dulles, the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, had held talks with Lubis.

The newspaper quoted a report from United Press on the 28th, saying that American officials in Washington also advocated that Hatta should lead the Indonesian cabinet.

A member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Indonesian Parliament told a reporter from the "People's Daily" that the American attitude was an absolutely rude interference, and he would submit the issue to the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee for discussion and handling.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" pointed out in today's editorial that the interference of American imperialism in Indonesia's domestic problems has now become extremely unreasonable. The fact is that the United States is not only standing on the side of the Dutch in West Irian, but is also blatantly standing on the side of Lubis in Jakarta and Simbolon in North Sumatra. The editorial believes that in order to safeguard national dignity, the government should at least lodge a protest with the U.S. government.

    印度尼西亚“人民日报”揭露
    美国同叛乱集团勾勾搭搭
    据新华社雅加达29日电　今天的印度尼西亚“人民日报”揭露说，美国正在粗暴地干涉印度尼西亚的内政。
    报纸说，在反叛的西姆波朗得势期间，在台湾搞航空公司的美国退伍军官陈纳德属下的飞机曾经在北苏门答腊降落。坐陈纳德的飞机到那里去的人答应援助西姆波朗，条件是保障美国在北苏门答腊的石油利益，最低限度同保障荷兰的石油利益一样。
    这家报纸还举出这个事实：即美国驻印度尼西亚大使柯明曾经向内阁总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约表示美国可能承认西姆波朗的政权。
    “人民日报”指出，叛变的军人阴谋集团在策划发动政变的时候就同美国有联系，报纸提醒大家不要忘记美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯曾经同卢比斯进行会谈。
    报纸援引合众社28日的报道说，在华盛顿的美国官员也主张由哈达来领导印度尼西亚内阁。
    印度尼西亚国会外交小组委员会人士对“人民日报”记者说，美国的这种态度是一种十足粗野的干涉，他将把这个问题提交外交小组委员会讨论处理。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”在今天的社论中指出，美帝国主义对印度尼西亚国内问题的干涉，目前已经是十分无理的了，事实是：美国不仅站在西伊里安的荷兰人方面，而且也明目张胆地站在雅加达的卢比斯和在北苏门答腊的西姆波朗的一边。社论认为，为了维护国家的尊严，政府最低限度要向美国政府提出抗议。
