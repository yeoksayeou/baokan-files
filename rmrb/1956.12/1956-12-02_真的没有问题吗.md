　　Is There Really No Problem?
　　By Our Reporter　Shen Shi
    The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and its various localities are currently inspecting the implementation of ethnic policies.

    Before the inspection, some people voiced arguments like: "Ethnic regional autonomy has been realized, minority ethnic cadres have grown up, could there still be problems?" "We don't have any problems, why do we have to inspect every year?" "We haven't had any disputes with minority ethnic comrades, there shouldn't be any problems."

    Indeed, Xinjiang has cultivated and promoted a large number of minority ethnic cadres. Take the Kashgar branch of the People's Bank of China as an example: from 1954 to 1956, it promoted more than one hundred minority ethnic comrades to leading cadre positions. This branch also systematically sent three hundred and ninety-eight minority ethnic cadres to professional schools and short-term training classes to study. After studying, these comrades' professional level and working ability have improved.

    However, some departments are not like this. Let's take a look at the state-owned Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory. Before July of this year, among the factory's five hundred and fifty-seven cadres, only twenty-four were minority ethnic cadres. Some important workshops and plants had no minority ethnic cadres at all. Let's also look at the Kashgar branch of the People's Construction Bank of China. When this branch requested to increase the number of cadres, it emphasized the need to understand the business and the Han language. When minority ethnic cadres were assigned, they asked: "Do they understand Han Chinese? If they do, we'll train them; if they don't, let the head office train them well and then assign them to us!" Why do two banks in the same city treat minority ethnic cadres with two different attitudes? Did the minority ethnic cadres of the Kashgar branch of the People's Bank of China understand the business as soon as they entered the bank? Obviously, the problem is not whether they understand the business and the language, but whether each department attaches importance to cultivating minority ethnic cadres.

    The former CPC Central Committee Xinjiang Branch and the CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee have repeatedly instructed that attention should be paid to ethnic forms and characteristics in minority ethnic areas. However, this meaningful instruction has not received due attention from some departments. To this day, many departments, especially industrial and mining enterprises, still ignore the languages and scripts of minority ethnicities. The upper-level organs of the vertical systems issue official documents and telegrams mostly in Han Chinese, and there are not many documents in Uyghur and Kazakh. Some units, when issuing documents written in Han Chinese, although noting "Uyghur documents will be sent later" after the document, in fact, they are not reissued for a long time. For example, the Han Chinese manager of the Kashgar Special District Department Store also issues official documents in Han Chinese to the minority ethnic section chiefs. The minority ethnic section chiefs only know that black characters are written on white paper and do not understand the content at all, so they have to put them aside. The business offices of the Kashgar Special District Post and Telecommunications Bureau are all Uyghur cadres, but the instructions and notices they receive are all in Han Chinese. Because they cannot understand them, they can only lock them in boxes. Sometimes, when Uyghur comrades make phone calls, the other party will not answer unless they speak Han Chinese; if the telegrams sent are in Han Chinese, they will be received, but if they are in Uyghur, they often will not be received. From January to April of this year, the Makit County Supply and Marketing Cooperative received more than two hundred instructions and notices from the former Shache Special District Cooperative Office and other units, most of which were in Han Chinese. The Makit County Supply and Marketing Cooperative once received instructions written in Han Chinese from a higher-level department to purchase "mint." The translator mistranslated "mint" as "wild mint," resulting in the purchase of more than two hundred catties of wild mint that could not be sold. Although the translator is responsible for this matter, the main problem lies in the failure to use minority ethnic languages, which is a negative consequence of not paying attention to ethnic characteristics.

    Over the past seven years, thousands of Han comrades have come to Xinjiang from thousands of miles away. The vast majority of comrades have shared weal and woe with the people of all ethnicities, worked diligently, and left behind commendable deeds. Especially the Han comrades working in pastoral areas, they live a nomadic life with the herdsmen. Many comrades have established deep friendships with the people of all ethnicities, eliminated the ethnic estrangement left over from history, and established new, friendly ethnic relations. However, there are also a few Han comrades who have not fully respected the customs and habits of the local residents. Many of the Han comrades who have newly arrived from the interior have not studied ethnic policies well. Some Han comrades have developed a sense of "superiority," and in their contact with minority ethnic comrades, they are not humble and sincere, but arrogant. They often cannot see the strengths of minority ethnic comrades, and regard anything that suits their taste as progressive, and anything that does not suit their taste as backward. Obviously, such comrades still have a strong Han chauvinistic ideology, and if they are not given timely criticism and education, it will inevitably affect ethnic unity. The problems discovered in this inspection refute those who believe that their departments have no problems, and give those who have Han chauvinistic sentiments a sobering injection. At present, Xinjiang is combining the study of the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC to inspect various tasks. Undoubtedly, through this study, the already established new ethnic relations will be further consolidated.

　　真的没有问题吗
　　本报记者　沈石
    新疆维吾尔自治区所辖各地，现在正在检查执行民族政策的情况。
    检查之前，有人发出了这样的论调：“民族区域自治实现了，少数民族干部成长起来了，还会有问题吗？”“我们并没有问题，为什么年年要检查？”“我们和少数民族同志没有发生过纠纷，不会有什么问题。”
    的确，新疆已经培养和提拔了大批少数民族干部。只拿中国人民银行喀什支行来说，从1954年到1956年，共提拔了一百多名少数民族同志担任领导干部，这个支行还有计划地选送了三百九十八名少数民族干部到专业学校和短期训练班去学习，这些同志经过学习，业务水平和工作能力都提高了。
    然而，某些部门却不是这样。请看看国营新疆七一棉纺织厂吧。在今年7月以前，这座工厂五百五十七名干部中，少数民族干部只有二十四名，有些重要的车间和工场，根本没有少数民族干部。再看一看中国人民建设银行喀什支行吧。这所支行要求增调干部的时候，强调要懂业务，懂汉族语言。少数民族干部分配来的时候，他们又问：“懂不懂汉话？懂的话，我们培养，不懂，让总行培养好了。再另外分配给我们吧！”为什么同在一座城市的两所银行，用两种不同的态度对待少数民族干部呢？难道中国人民银行喀什支行的少数民族干部一进银行就懂业务吗？显然，问题不在于懂不懂业务和语言，而在于各个部门是不是重视培养少数民族干部。
    前中共中央新疆分局及中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会曾经多次指示在少数民族地区应该注意民族形式和民族特点。然而，这一意味深长的指示，还没有引起某些部门应有的重视。直到今天，许多部门、特别是工矿企业单位，仍然忽视少数民族的语言文字。垂直系统的上级机关，颁发的公文电报等，大部分使用汉文，用维吾尔、哈萨克文的文件还不多。有的单位在发出用汉文书写的文件的时候，在文件后面虽然注明“维吾尔文的文件以后补送”，实际上以后很长的时间也没有补发。像喀什专区百货公司的汉族经理向少数民族科长批发的公文，也用汉文，少数民族科长仅知道白纸上写的是黑字，根本不知道内容，只好压在一边。喀什专区邮电局营业所都是维吾尔族干部，收到的指示和通知，却都是汉文，因为看不懂，只有锁在箱子里。有时维吾尔族同志摇电话，不说汉话对方就不答话；送来的电报是汉文的就收，是维吾尔文的，往往就不收。麦盖提县供销社从今年1月到4月，收到原莎车专区合作办事处等单位发来的指示和通知共二百多件，其中绝大部分使用汉文。麦盖提县供销社一次接到上级部门发来的用汉文写的收购“薄荷”的指示，翻译同志把“薄荷”误译成“野薄荷”，结果收购了二百多斤野薄荷销不出去。这件事情固然翻译有责任，但是主要的问题在于没有使用少数民族语言，是不注意民族特点所产生的不良后果。
    七年来，成千上万的汉族同志，不远千里来到新疆，绝大多数的同志和各民族人民同甘共苦，兢兢业业，留下了可歌可颂的事迹。特别是在牧业区工作的汉族同志，他们和牧民们在一起，过着游牧的生活。许多同志和各族人民建立了深厚的友谊，消除了历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂，树立了崭新的友爱的民族关系。但是，也还有少数的汉族同志并没有充分尊重当地居民的风俗习惯。而新从内地来的汉族同志，许多人没有很好地学习过民族政策，有的汉族同志滋长着一种“优越感”，和少数民族同志接触当中，不是谦虚诚恳，而是盛气凌人，他们往往看不见少数民族同志的长处，凡是适合自己口味的东西就认为进步，不适合的就认为是落后。显然，这样的同志还有着浓厚的大汉族主义思想，如果不及时给以批判教育，势必影响民族团结。这次检查中所发现的问题，驳斥了那些认为自己的部门没有什么问题的说法，给那些有大汉族主义思想情绪的人，注射了一副清醒剂。目前，新疆各地正结合学习中共第八次全国代表大会的文件来检查各项工作，无疑的，通过这次学习，一定会使已经奠定的新的民族关系更加巩固起来。
