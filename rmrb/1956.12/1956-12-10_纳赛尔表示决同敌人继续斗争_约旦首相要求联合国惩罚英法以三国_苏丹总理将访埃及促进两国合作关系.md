Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Rome News: The Rome "Times" reported that Egyptian President Nasser, when meeting with Igor Mann, a reporter from the newspaper stationed in Cairo, stated: "He is determined to continuously fight against the enemy's attempts in other aspects in Egypt and the Middle East."

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Amman News: Jordanian Prime Minister Suleiman Nabulsi demanded on the 8th that the United Nations impose economic and political punishments on Britain, France, and Israel.

When a reporter asked if the withdrawal of Britain, France, and Israel from Egypt was enough, the Prime Minister replied: "Undoubtedly, all small countries that love peace should ask themselves if withdrawal is enough, and should worry about their freedom and independence. Therefore, the remedy for this situation is to make the aggressors bear the cost of their aggression and to impose disciplinary sanctions so that major powers will not repeat this aggression." Nabulsi said: "We are counting on the United Nations to give these aggressors economic and political punishments."

Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Cairo News: According to the Middle East News Agency, Sudanese Prime Minister Abdullah Khalil said on December 8th in Khartoum via telephone to the Egyptian weekly "Today's News" that the withdrawal of the invading forces from Egypt is necessary.

He said that foreign troops cannot stay on Egyptian territory for a long time, because their act of aggression was wrong, and it would be even more wrong if they continued their unnecessary stay in Egypt.

The Sudanese Prime Minister is scheduled to visit Egypt on December 9th. He said he will discuss with Egyptian President Nasser the further cooperation between Sudan and Egypt and the issue of Arab unity.

    新华社9日讯　安曼消息：约旦首相苏莱曼·纳布西8日要求联合国对英、法、以色列给予经济和政治上的惩罚。
    当一位记者问，英、法、以色列从埃及撤退是不是就够了呢？这位首相答复说：“无疑地一切爱好和平的小国家要问问它们自己撤退是不是就够了，而且要为他们的自由和独立担心。因此，针对这种情况的补救办法就是使侵略者担负他们侵略的代价，并且给予惩戒处分，使大国不再重复这种侵略。”纳布西说：“我们指望着联合国给这些侵略者经济和政治上的惩罚。
