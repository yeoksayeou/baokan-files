Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 17th. Thirty-five counties and cities in Shanxi Province have held representative conferences of outstanding young commune members of agricultural cooperatives, summarizing experiences and conducting awards. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League also issued "Outstanding Young Commune Member" certificates of merit to young people from agricultural cooperatives in various regions who have demonstrated outstanding performance. Since the spring, after Ren Huanhai and five other rural youths in Wuxiang County initiated a province-wide campaign in Shanxi to "strive to be an outstanding commune member," young people in various regions have actively participated in this activity, and a large number of outstanding young people have emerged continuously in various productions. According to statistics from Changzhi and Yuci special districts alone, more than 99,000 young people have been rated as outstanding commune members by agricultural cooperatives. After the Chengguan Agricultural Cooperative in Zuoquan County suffered from flooding, a youth group composed of fifteen young people took the lead in combating the disaster and carrying out self-rescue, ensuring that production decreased but income did not, and all were rated as outstanding commune members. Many young commune members have performed well in exploring avenues for increased production, exemplarily abiding by cooperative regulations, and maintaining collective undertakings.

    山西奖励优秀青年社员
    新华社太原17日电　山西省已经有三十五个县、市举行了农业社青年优秀社员代表会议，总结了经验，进行了奖励。青年团山西省委员会还对各地表现突出的农业社青年颁发了“青年优秀社员”奖状。今年春季武乡县任焕孩等六名农村青年向山西全省倡议开展“争取做一个优秀社员”的活动以后，各地青年积极参加这一活动，在各项生产中连续涌现出大批优秀青年。仅据长治、榆次两个专区统计，就有九万九千多名青年被农业社评为优秀社员。左权县城关农业社遭受洪灾后，十五个青年组成的青年组带头抗灾自救，保证减产不减收入，全部被评为优秀社员。许多青年社员在挖掘增产门路、模范遵守社章、维护集体事业等方面表现很好。
