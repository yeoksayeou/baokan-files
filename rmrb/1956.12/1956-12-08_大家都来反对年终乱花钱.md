　　Everyone Should Oppose Year-End Reckless Spending
　　*People's Daily* Commentator
    Every year-end, some government offices and enterprises try every possible way to spend money recklessly, in order to avoid handing over surplus budget funds. They send people everywhere to purchase equipment that is not urgently needed and is outside the plan, and even prepay for supplies that cannot be obtained this year. This year is no exception. As early as September, the Ministry of Health notified its affiliated units that if the construction and installation investment could not be fully used, part of the funds could be transferred to purchase equipment outside the plan. The Ministry of Railways has approved a cadre school to report the houses originally built with enterprise bonus funds as basic construction investment for reimbursement. According to the statistics of a retail department of Beijing Transportation Electrical Equipment Company alone, seventeen units have purchased electric fans in the past two months. The Hydropower Construction General Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power has been actively spending money everywhere, and the travel expenses and telegram fees spent by purchasing personnel alone amounted to 10,000 yuan. It should be stated that this phenomenon has also occurred in other places, and it has not completely stopped until now.
    Anyone who sees this phenomenon will be angry and has the right to question: Since there is so much money, why not return it to the state? Why does the phenomenon of rushing to spend money occur every year? When will it be completely corrected?
    This phenomenon must be corrected immediately. The State Council issued a notice in late November, requiring all regions and departments to strictly control expenditures, and resolutely not to do or postpone undertakings and constructions that can be avoided or postponed; expenditures that can be saved should be saved as much as possible; all government offices, organizations, troops, and enterprises should immediately check and correct the strange phenomenon of rushing to spend money at the end of the year.
    Can this phenomenon be corrected immediately? The key lies in whether the leading cadres of those government offices and enterprises can take the overall situation into consideration and overcome departmentalism. They certainly know that our country's construction funds are not abundant, and we must strictly abide by the principle of thrift and use every penny in the most necessary places and at the most necessary times. However, when dealing with specific issues related to the interests of their own units, why can't they withstand the test and forget that most ordinary principle? Considering the needs of the work of their own units and the welfare of the personnel of their own units is the responsibility of the leading personnel of each unit, but harming the public interest for the sake of the private interest, not considering the needs of the entire country and the interests of the people of the whole country, and only focusing on the trivial matters under their noses, what kind of correct leadership is this? The seriousness of the problem also lies in the fact that they clearly know that things are not right, but they continue to happen every year.
    To completely overcome this departmentalism and correct the phenomenon of rushing to spend money at the end of the year, it is natural to strengthen the leadership and supervision of the Party and give those who knowingly violate the law the punishment they deserve; at the same time, it is necessary to promote the supervision of lower-level cadres, ordinary staff, and the broad masses of these units. The purchasing personnel and financial personnel in government offices, and the sales personnel in commercial departments know their situation most clearly. As long as they can be mobilized to stand up and speak, those departmentalists will have nowhere to hide.
    Naturally, the questions raised in the letters from readers Wang Hanzhi and others are also worthy of close attention by the financial departments.
    We hear unpleasant news of rushing to spend money at the end of each year. Which year will it end? For the sake of the country's socialist construction, let's hope that this year will be the last year!

　　大家都来反对年终乱花钱
　　本报评论员
    每到年终，都有一些机关、企业想尽方法突击花钱，为的是逃避上缴预算结余资金。他们派人四出收购并不急需的在计划以外的设备，甚至预付款项订购今年拿不到的用品。今年也不例外。卫生部早在9月间就通知所属单位，如果建筑安装投资不能全部用完，可以调出部分资金购置计划外的设备。铁道部已经批准一个干部学校把原来用企业奖励金盖的房子，改在基本建设投资中报销。仅据北京交通电工器材公司的一个门市部统计，在近两个月中，有十七个单位去买电扇。电力部水力发电建设总局为了花钱到处活动，仅采购人员花的旅费和电报费就有一万元。应该说明，这种现象在其它地方也发生了，而且到现在还没有完全停止。
    谁看到这种现象都会气愤，都有权利提出质问：既然钱多了，为什么不交还给国家？突击花钱的现象为什么年年发生？究竟到什么时候才能彻底纠正呢？
    这种现象是必须立即纠正的。国务院在11月下旬已经发出通知，要求各地区、各部门严格控制支出，凡是可以不办或者缓办的事业和建设，应当坚决不办或者缓办；凡是可以节省的开支，应当尽量节省；各机关、团体、部队、企业应该立即检查和纠正年终突击花钱的怪现象。
    这种现象能不能立即纠正呢？关键在于那些机关、企业的领导干部能不能顾全大局，克服本位主义思想。他们当然知道，我们国家的建设资金并不宽裕，我们必须严格遵守节约的原则，把每一文钱都用到最必需的地方，用在最必需的时候。可是，当处理同本单位的利益有关的具体问题的时候，为什么就经不起考验，忘记了那个最普通的道理呢？考虑本单位工作的需要和本单位人员的福利，是每个单位的领导人员的责任，可是，为了小公损害大公，不考虑整个国家的需要和全国人民的利益，只斤斤于自己眉毛鼻子下面的一些事情，这算得上什么正确领导呢？问题的严重性也就在于：明明知道事情不对，但却年年都在继续发生。
    要彻底克服这种本位主义思想，纠正年终突击花钱的现象，自然需要加强党的领导和监督，给那些知法犯法的人以应得的处理；同时要提倡这些单位的下级干部、普通工作人员和广大群众的监督。机关里的采购人员和财务人员，商业部门的营业人员了解他们的情况是最清楚的，只要能够发动他们都站出来讲话，那些本位主义就没有藏身之地了。
    自然，读者王涵之等的来信中提出的问题，也是值得财政部门密切注意的。
    我们每年年终都听到使人不愉快的突击花钱的消息，究竟哪一年才能结束呢？为了国家的社会主义建设事业，希望今年是最后的一年吧！
