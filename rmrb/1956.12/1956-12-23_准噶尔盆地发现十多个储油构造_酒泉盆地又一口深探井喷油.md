Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 22nd. Geological exploration personnel from the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration have discovered and confirmed more than ten oil-bearing structures suitable for drilling this year. These structures are distributed on the platform margin and marginal depression zone of the Junggar Basin, connecting with the Karamay-Urho oil area.

This year, while vigorously exploring the Karamay-Urho oil area, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration strengthened its comprehensive research on the Junggar Basin. Dozens of exploration teams conducted extensive exploration work in the Junggar Basin, including geological, gravity, magnetic, electrical, seismic, and structural drilling exploration. New oil and oil sand occurrences have been discovered in many places.

Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, 22nd. A deep exploration well in the Ya'erxia area of the Jiuquan Basin recently gushed a large amount of brownish-brown crude oil from a depth of more than five li underground. By late at night on December 20th, the Yumen Mining Bureau had taken some technical measures to stop the crude oil gushing. This is the second exciting news from the Yumen Oil Mine this year, following the discovery of oil traces in the Qingnan structure.

Ya'erxia is a new drilling area opened up by the Yumen Oil Mine based on the geographical conditions and other geological factors in this area. The first deep exploration well started drilling at the end of May this year. On December 18th, when this well was drilled to a depth of more than 2,500 meters, a large amount of crude oil gushed out.

The Drilling Company of the Yumen Mining Bureau is now undertaking the detailed exploration design of this area; the second exploration well will also start drilling soon.

### 准噶尔盆地发现十多个储油构造  酒泉盆地又一口深探井喷油

    准噶尔盆地发现十多个储油构造
    酒泉盆地又一口深探井喷油
    新华社乌鲁木齐22日电　新疆石油管理局的地质勘探人员，今年又发现和证实了十多个可供钻探的储油构造。这些构造分布在准噶尔盆地的地台边缘和边缘拗陷区，同克拉玛依—乌尔禾油区相连接。
    今年，新疆石油管理局在大力勘探克拉玛依—乌尔禾油区的同时，加强了对准噶尔盆地的综合研究。几十个勘探队在准噶尔盆地进行了巨大的勘探工作，包括地质、重力、磁力、电测、地震和构造钻井等勘探工作，在许多地方又新发现了油苗和油砂。
    新华社玉门22日电　酒泉盆地鸭儿峡地区有一口深探井最近从深达五华里多的地下大量喷出棕褐色的原油。到12月20日深夜，由于玉门矿务局采取了一些技术措施，才制止住了这股原油的喷射。这是玉门油矿今年继青南构造发现油迹以后传来的第二个令人兴奋的消息。
    鸭儿峡是玉门油矿根据这个地区所处的地理条件和其他地质因素，新开辟的一个钻探地区。今年5月底，第一口深探井开钻。12月18日这口井钻打到两千五百多公尺的时候，大量喷出了原油。
    现在玉门矿务局钻井公司正在着手进行这个地区的详探设计；第二口探井不久也要开钻。
