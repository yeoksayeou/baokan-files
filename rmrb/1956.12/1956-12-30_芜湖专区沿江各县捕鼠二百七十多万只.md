Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Telegram: Wuhu, Wuwei, Hanshan, He County, Dangtu and other counties in Anhui Province along the Yangtze River, in conjunction with the construction of farmland water conservancy projects, have launched a mass rat-catching campaign. In the past two months, more than 2.7 million rats have been captured.

These counties along the Yangtze River have many wild rats. Although millions have been captured and eliminated in the past two years, they are still increasing year by year. These rats not only gnaw on furniture and clothing and steal food, but also ruin crops. According to He County statistics, cultivated land affected by rat damage accounts for 83% of the total cultivated land area, generally reducing yields by about 10%.

    芜湖专区沿江各县捕鼠二百七十多万只
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省沿江的芜湖、无为、含山、和县、当涂等县，结合兴修农田水利工程，掀起了群众性的捕鼠运动。两个月来，已经捕捉老鼠二百七十多万只。
    这些沿江县份有很多野老鼠。两年来虽然被捕捉消灭数百万只，但是仍在逐年增加。这些老鼠不但咬坏家具衣物，偷吃食粮，而且糟塌农作物。据和县统计，受鼠害的耕地占耕地总面积83％，一般减少收成10％左右。
