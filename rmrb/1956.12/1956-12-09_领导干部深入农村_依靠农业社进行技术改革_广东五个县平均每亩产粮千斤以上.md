Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 8th: The five counties of Chenghai, Chaoan, Chaoyang, Jieyang, and Puning on the Chaoshan Plain in Guangdong Province have all become "Thousand-Jin Counties" for grain this year. The five counties have a total of 1,890,000 mu of cultivated land, with an average grain harvest of over 1,000 jin per mu.

    Jieyang and Puning counties are receiving the title of "Thousand-Jin County" for the first time this year. Preliminary statistics from Jieyang County show that the average yield of rice (double-cropping rice) is 915.7 jin per mu, and with the addition of wheat and other miscellaneous grains, the total grain yield is 1,020 jin. Puning County's average rice yield (double-cropping rice) is more than 910 jin per mu, and with the addition of miscellaneous grains, it also reaches more than 1,000 jin. Chenghai, Chaoan, and Chaoyang counties continue to maintain the title of "Thousand-Jin County" they received last year. Chenghai County's 160,000 mu of double-cropping rice averaged 1,096.7 jin of grain per mu, an increase of 9.7 jin over last year. Although Chaoan County's late rice production was reduced due to the untimely supply of commercial fertilizers, the average yield of early and late rice still reached 1,009 jin per mu. Chaoyang County's late rice production was reduced due to severe drought, but the yield of early and late rice remained at last year's level of 908 jin per mu; with the addition of miscellaneous grains, the average grain yield was more than 1,000 jin per mu.

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 8th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Man reports: The five counties in Guangdong Province's Chaoshan Plain all produced more than 1,000 jin of grain per mu this year. What are the reasons for this achievement? The reporter interviewed local leading organizations on this issue. According to them, the main reason is that the leading cadres of the CPC organizations at all levels have gone deep into the rural areas, relied on the agricultural cooperatives, and correctly organized a mass agricultural technology reform movement.

    The leading cadres of the CPC Shantou Local Committee and the county committees often go deep into the rural areas to provide specific guidance for the production of one district and one township. Among the 29 members of the Chaoan County Party Committee, 14 are regularly stationed in key districts and key townships. Each district and township also cultivate key townships and key cooperatives separately. Based on each agricultural season, each district, township, and cooperative formulate short-term production plans, carry out labor competitions, and organize observation and evaluation, forming a mass production upsurge. For example, during the winter slack season, labor competitions centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation are carried out, and during the spring sowing season, observation and evaluation centered on the promotion of fine varieties and the cultivation of strong seedlings are organized. In this way, various production increase measures are implemented one after another. During the late rice growing season this year, due to the shortage of commercial fertilizers, counties launched fertilizer accumulation competitions, and agricultural cooperatives generally applied topdressing two or three times. In this way, mass labor competitions effectively spread new experiences and new technologies.

    When leading farmers to carry out agricultural technology reforms, the CPC Shantou Local Committee and county committees pay attention to convincing farmers with vivid facts and promptly organize farmers to summarize and promote experiences. In the past, farmers in the Chaoshan Plain were accustomed to planting rice with large spacing and low yields. This year, they generally promoted a series of advanced technologies centered on small spacing and dense planting. This is the result of the local CPC organization's gradual promotion of the method of pilot demonstration and summarizing lessons from failures since 1953. In recent years, counties have sent a group of cadres to reside in agricultural cooperatives where famous agricultural labor models are located, to jointly study and summarize production experience with them, and to use the forms of convening agricultural labor model conferences and forums for elderly farmers to impart and exchange production experience. Especially this year, the counties have strengthened their leadership in the production of mountainous and low-yield areas. Last year, the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative led by Lin Yancheng, a national agricultural production increase model in Jieyang County, implemented single-plant dense planting of rice, creating the highest record of unit area yield of double-cropping rice in the country. The CPC Shantou Local Committee promptly summarized the high-yield experience of this cooperative and organized a "Study Lin Yancheng High-Yield Movement" throughout the entire special district. In Jieyang County alone, 212 agricultural cooperatives established "Lin Yancheng High-Yield Groups"; each cooperative reserved high-yield fields for single-plant dense planting experiments. The single-plant dense planting rice promoted by the counties produced more than the small-plant dense planting rice.

    The CPC organizations at all levels in the Chaoshan Plain recognize that cultivating grassroots agricultural technicians is one of the important conditions for smoothly carrying out agricultural technology reform work. This year, more than 70,000 agricultural technicians have been trained locally. Technical guidance stations and technical research groups have spread throughout the districts and every agricultural cooperative. Agricultural technicians have played a significant role in practical work.

    The CPC organizations at all levels in the Chaoshan Plain also have shortcomings in leading agricultural technology reform work. For example, when promoting early rice dry sowing and single-plant dense planting this year, some areas blindly copied the method regardless of the specific conditions, resulting in reduced production. However, this error was corrected when sowing late rice.

    领导干部深入农村　依靠农业社进行技术改革
　　广东五个县平均每亩产粮千斤以上
    新华社广州8日电　广东省潮汕平原上的澄海、潮安、潮阳、揭阳和普宁五个县，今年都成了粮食“千斤县”。五个县共有一百八十九万亩耕地，平均每亩收获粮食一千斤以上。
    揭阳和普宁两县今年都是第一次获得粮食“千斤县”的称号。揭阳县初步统计，平均每亩产水稻（双季稻）九百一十五点七斤，加上小麦和其他杂粮，共产粮食一千零二十斤。普宁县平均每亩产水稻（双季稻）九百一十多斤，加上杂粮，也达到一千斤以上。澄海、潮安、潮阳三县都继续保持了去年获得的“千斤县”的称号。澄海县十六万亩双季稻，平均每亩产粮食一千零九十六点七斤，比去年增加九点七斤。潮安县虽然晚稻受商品肥料供应不及时的影响而减产，但是早、晚两季水稻每亩平均产量仍达到一千零九斤。潮阳县晚稻因严重受旱而减产，但是早、晚两季水稻仍保持去年每亩九百零八斤的产量水平；加上杂粮，平均每亩产粮食一千多斤。
    新华社广州8日电　新华社记者王曼报道：广东省潮汕平原五个县今年都是每亩产粮食一千斤以上。获得这个成就的原因在那里？记者曾就这个问题访问了当地的领导机关。据谈，原因主要在于中共各级组织的领导干部深入农村，依靠农业社，正确地组织了群众性的农业技术改革运动。
    中共汕头地方委员会和各县委员会的领导干部经常深入农村，具体指导一区、一乡的生产。潮安县二十九个县委委员中，经常有十四个驻在各重点区和重点乡。各区、乡也都分别培养重点乡和重点社。各区、乡、社就根据各个农时季节，制定短期生产计划，开展劳动竞赛，组织观摩评比，形成了群众性的生产高潮。例如，冬闲期间开展以兴修水利、积肥为中心的劳动竞赛，春播季节组织以推广良种、培育壮秧为中心的观摩评比。这样，一环接一环地贯彻各项增产措施。今年晚稻生长期间，由于商品肥料缺乏，各县就曾经开展积肥竞赛，农业社普遍做到追肥两三遍。这样，具有群众性的劳动竞赛就很有成效地传播了新经验、新技术。
    中共汕头地方委员会和各县委员会在领导农民开展农业技术改革的时候，注意以活的事实来说服农民，及时组织农民总结和推广经验。潮汕平原的农民过去种植水稻习惯大株稀植，产量不高。今年他们普遍推广了以小株密植为中心的一系列先进技术。这是当地中共组织从1953年以来，采取试点示范的办法、从失败中总结经验教训逐步推广的结果。几年来，各县都派出一批干部分驻在一些著名农业劳动模范所在的农业社里，和他们共同研究和总结生产经验，并且运用召开农业劳动模范大会、老年农民座谈会等形式，来传授和交流生产经验。特别是今年，各县还加强了对山区和低产区生产的领导。去年揭阳县全国农业增产模范林炎城领导的云光农业社，推行水稻单株密植，创造了全国双季稻单位面积产量的最高纪录。中共汕头地方委员会及时总结了这个社的丰产经验，并且在全专区范围内组织了“学习林炎城丰产运动”。仅揭阳县就有二百一十二个农业社成立了“林炎城丰产小组”；各社都留了丰产田来作单株密植的试验。各县推广的单株密植的水稻，比小株密植的水稻增产更多。
    潮汕平原中共各级组织认识到培养基层的农业技术人员，是顺利开展农业技术改革工作的重要条件之一。今年当地共训练了农业技术人员七万多人。技术指导站和技术研究小组已经遍及各区和每个农业社。农业技术人员在实际工作中起了很大的作用。
    潮汕平原中共各级组织在领导农业技术改革工作中，也不是没有缺点的。例如，今年推广早稻旱播和单株密植的时候，部分地区发生不顾具体条件盲目搬用的现象，以致造成减产。但是，这一错误在播种晚稻的时候得到了纠正。
