Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 18th: Japan's Liberal Democratic Party's new president, Tanzan Ishibashi, spoke yesterday with the political director of Kyodo News about his plans for policy implementation after taking over from Ichiro Hatoyama to form a new cabinet.

Ishibashi emphasized his attitude towards the United States and China, as he felt the United States seemed to have misunderstandings about him in these areas.

Since Ishibashi was elected president of Japan's ruling party, Western news agencies have been constantly reporting that the United States is very concerned that Japan will pursue an "independent," "more active" foreign policy and will expand Sino-Japanese trade.

When discussing how to specifically maintain relations with the United States, Ishibashi said that in the current Japan-U.S. relationship, "Japan itself has things that need to be revised, and there are many things that the United States needs to revise as well."

Ishibashi specifically stated that Japan's diplomacy "will not have any special changes." He said, "Japan will take the United States as its leader, act as a member of the free world in the East, and strive for world peace. Japan will resolutely implement this policy, but it needs the United States and other free world countries to understand Japan's position well."

Ishibashi continued, "Even so, we will not achieve this goal by blindly following the United States. I intend to take this attitude: perhaps engaging in some even quarrel-like arguments with the United States, and the result of the arguments can enable both sides to understand and cooperate."

Ishibashi recalled that during MacArthur's rule over Japan, the United States had "misunderstandings" about him. He said that at that time, he believed that it was not enough to just nod and agree when speaking to the MacArthur Headquarters; therefore, he frankly discussed the actual situation in Japan and his own opinions with them, and argued with them.

Ishibashi stated that if the United States still has any misunderstandings about him now, he hopes to eliminate them; if necessary, and if time and conditions permit, he can go to Washington.

When asked whether Ishibashi would disregard the "free world" and approach China and restore diplomatic relations after forming a cabinet, Ishibashi said, "My current thinking is that I firmly do not intend to do so." He stated that he "is willing to always take the United States as the leader and jointly solve the problem of Communist China."

Ishibashi believes that the United States often adopts an attitude of trying to subdue China with strength, so it is difficult to handle. He suspects that this attitude of the United States is a mistake.

Ishibashi said that in terms of economic policy, Japan not only wants to trade with China and the Soviet Union, but also hopes to develop towards newer markets—Southeast Asian countries or Central and South America, and Middle Eastern countries.

Ishibashi also said that what his cabinet must do in the future is: political "democratization," economic expansion, and stabilization of people's livelihoods.

### 石桥谈组阁后的外交政策  愿以美国为领导者但要修正日美关系  认为美国用实力对付中国是一个错误

    石桥谈组阁后的外交政策
    愿以美国为领导者但要修正日美关系
    认为美国用实力对付中国是一个错误
    新华社18日讯　东京消息：日本自由民主党新任总裁石桥湛山昨天同共同社政治部长谈到他在接替鸠山一郎组织新内阁以后的施政方针的计划。
    石桥着重解释了他对美国和对中国的态度。因为石桥感觉到美国在这些方面好像对他有误解。
    自从石桥当选日本执政党的总裁后，西方通讯社就不断传出美国非常担心日本将执行“独立的”、
  “更为积极的”外交政策，并且将扩大日中贸易。
    石桥在谈到怎样具体地维持对美国的关系时说，在目前的日美关系方面，“日本本身有需要修正的地方，而需要美国修正的地方也多得很。”
    石桥特别说明，日本的外交“不会有什么特别的改变”。他说，“日本将以美国为领导者，做为自由国家集团在东方的一个成员，为世界和平而努力。日本将坚决执行这个方针，但是需要美国和其他自由国家集团很好地了解日本的立场。”
    石桥接着说：“虽然如此，我们对美国唯命是从也不会达到这个目的。我打算采取这样的态度：也许同美国进行一些甚至像吵架似的争论，而争论的结果能使双方了解和合作”。
    石桥追述说，在麦克阿瑟统治日本时期，美国方面就对他有过“误解”。他说，那时他认为，对麦克阿瑟司令部说话时，光是唯唯诺诺点头称是是不行的；所以他曾经坦率地谈出了日本的实际情况和自己的意见，同他们争论。
    石桥表示，如果美国现在还对他有什么误解，希望务必消除；如果有必要，并且时间和条件都允许，他可以到华盛顿去。
    当被问到石桥在组成内阁后是否会不顾“自由国家集团”而同中国接近并恢复邦交时，石桥说，“现在我的想法是坚决不打算这样做”。他表示“愿意始终以美国为领导者，共同解决共产党中国问题”。
    石桥认为，美国往往采取想以实力来使中国屈服的态度，所以很难办。他怀疑美国这种态度是一个错误。
    石桥谈到经济政策时说，日本不光是要同中国和苏联贸易，并且还希望向比较新的市场——东南亚国家或者中南美、中近东国家发展。
    石桥还说，他的内阁将来一定要做的事情是：政治“民主化”、扩大经济和安定民生。
