    The Era Publishing House Gives Away Too Many Books
    I am a staff member of the Era Publishing House, and I am now reporting something to you.
    In addition to sending books published by our publishing house to the Beijing Library and the reference rooms of relevant departments, a large number of books are also given to many responsible comrades. From January to August of this year, the value of books given away by our publishing house to various parties reached more than 1,000 yuan.
    Our publishing house publishes many types of books. Regardless of the type of book published, it must be given to many responsible comrades. I doubt whether these responsible comrades need these books, and whether it is absolutely necessary to send them. For example, the "Russian-Chinese Dictionary" recently published by our publishing house only printed 20,000 copies due to insufficient paper. Many readers who need it cannot buy it, but many responsible comrades, regardless of whether they understand Russian, each received a copy. This is unreasonable. I suggest that the publishing house not give away books indiscriminately in the future. Xu Shaofeng

    时代出版社赠书太多
    我是时代出版社的一个工作人员，现向你们反映一件事情。
    我社出版的书籍，除了赠送给北京图书馆和有关部门的几个资料室外，还有很大一部分的书籍赠送给许多负责同志。今年1月至8月，我社赠送各方面的图书价值达一千多元。
    我社出版的书的种类很多，不管出版什么种类的书，都要赠送给许多负责同志。我怀疑这许多负责同志，是否需要这些书，而且是否非送不可。比方说，我社最近出版的“俄华大辞典”，因为纸张不足，只印了两万册，许多需要的读者却买不到，而许多负责同志，不管懂不懂俄文，却每人都接到一本。这是不合理的。我建议出版社以后不要滥送书籍。　许少峰
