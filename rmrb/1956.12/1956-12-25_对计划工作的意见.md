Opinions on Planning Work
Ye Youtang, Minfeng Paper Mill, Jiaxing, Zhejiang

As an economic planning worker in an industrial enterprise, I would like to discuss some issues in the current planning work of industrial enterprises for the reference of industrial management departments.

Late Delivery, Urgent Demand

Everyone knows that the annual production, technology, and finance plan of an industrial enterprise is compiled after the state issues planned control figures (of course, before this, there is also the work of annual production, technology, and finance plan suggestions, but let’s not talk about that for now). This plan is related to the entire year's work of the enterprise. To compile this plan, it is necessary for everyone from the factory director to the economic planning staff and technical personnel, down to the masses of workers, as well as the party and mass political workers of the enterprise, to participate. Only in this way can we ensure that the plan reflects the Party's line and that the plan is technically reliable and economically reasonable. However, to mobilize so many people to participate in the planning work requires a certain amount of time. In the Soviet Union, it usually takes two months. However, here, the control figures from the superior authorities are delivered very late. It is already considered early if the control figures for the next year are delivered in November of each year. This year, the control figures for our factory to compile the draft plan for 1957 were issued by the superior authorities on November 30, but the time required for the enterprise to submit the draft plan was December 15. That is to say, the enterprise should compile and submit the draft plan within fifteen days. It is inconceivable to ask the enterprise to submit the paper within half a month for such an overall work.

In principle, the annual plan should be compiled once a year, but we compile it two or three times a year. Take my factory's 1956 annual production plan as an example! In addition to the annual plan suggestion work, the 1956 plan was compiled at the end of 1955, which was considered a draft plan and submitted to the superior for approval. In March 1956, according to the instructions of the superior, a comprehensive revision was carried out, which was called the revised draft plan, and then reported to the superior for instructions. In October 1956, according to the instructions of the superior, the third revised annual plan draft was compiled and submitted to the superior for approval. As of when I wrote this article (December 12), it had not yet been approved, and it was not known whether we would be notified to revise it again.

The annual plan should be compiled once a year, but we compile it two or three times a year. The quarterly plan must be compiled every quarter. There are four seasons in a year, and it is clearly stipulated that it should be compiled four times. The quarterly plan is the same as the annual plan, it is "all martial arts", including production, labor, material supply, cost accounting, and technical organization measures. Its full name is "Quarterly Production Technology and Finance Plan". Moreover, the forms used are similar to those of the annual plan, it can be said that they are the same amount.

If we say that the quarterly plan is only compiled once every quarter, it should be said to save trouble. However, the purpose of the superior is to make the plan correct and ensure smooth execution. Therefore, following the compilation procedure of the annual plan, first, we do the suggestion work, and then compile the draft plan. As for the time limit for the enterprise to compile, of course, it cannot exceed the compilation time of the annual plan, at most, it can only be ten days or half a month, and it must be submitted on time. What happens after the submission? Will the superior approve it immediately? When can it be approved? No one can answer. The result is: production is production, and planning is planning. If we wait for the superior to approve it before producing, then no one should produce. Therefore, we can only produce while waiting for the superior to approve, ten days, half a month, one month, two months...

More Changes, More Disconnections

If it is just that the plan is compiled many times, and it can be executed smoothly after the plan is compiled, then it is still worthwhile to compile it several times. As an economic planning worker, one should not be lazy, and what reason is there to complain about compiling the plan several times? However, the reality is not like this. It has become a habit for the annual plan to change frequently. Everyone thinks it is not surprising. Speaking of the reasons for the many changes, we say this, and the superiors also say this, that is: "Objective reality cannot be fully considered when compiling the plan." Of course, this is also the actual situation. I am not advocating that we should not consider objective factors at all, and the plan cannot be changed once it is set; but rather, the plan changes too much now.

Not only does the annual plan change frequently, but even the quarterly plan also changes frequently. The quantity of products changes frequently, the specifications of products change frequently, and even the variety of products also changes frequently. It doesn't matter if the superior requires the enterprise to change the plan, a document or a telegram can issue orders, but it is the enterprise that suffers. Major changes require changes in labor organization and procurement of other raw materials, and minor changes also require adjustment of equipment and consideration of technical measures. These large and small changes occur seven or eight times a year. In the third quarter of this year alone, our factory produced five kinds of products outside the plan. This not only wastes a lot of manpower and material resources but also makes it impossible for the production and technical preparation work to be arranged and carried out according to normal procedures, affecting normal production. Our factory's monthly plan has also been disrupted several times by task changes. This approach also affects the production enthusiasm of the workers.

Another serious consequence of the many changes in the plan is the destruction of the balance and connection of the various components of the production, technology, and finance plan. Due to the change of product varieties and specifications, the enterprise needs to adjust the labor organization and adopt new technical measures, which has to break the labor plan and cost and profit plans, affecting the comprehensive completion of the enterprise plan. When the superior instructs to revise the plan, it usually only revises the production plan, and does not fully consider the other plan parts.

If the imbalance and disconnection of the various plan parts are only caused by the change of the plan, that is not the most important thing, as long as the superior adjusts other plan parts accordingly when changing the production plan. However, the actual situation is not the case. There are many situations that show that it is entirely due to the subjectivism of the competent authority. For example, the production plan has not yet been determined, and even the control figures have not been issued, the competent authority requires the enterprise to prepare a material supply plan, and the submission date is much earlier than the production plan. For example, our factory's material pre-allocation plan for the first quarter of 1957 was submitted to the central government as early as November 25. However, the production plan control figures for 1957 were still issued on November 30. At that time, the production plan had not even started to be compiled. For example, the commodity delivery plan also goes ahead of the production plan. Our factory's supply plan for the first quarter of 1957 was submitted on November 7, and the production plan for the first quarter has not yet started. Who should be responsible for this disconnection? I am very strange: if all industrial enterprises in the country compile the material supply plan before compiling the production plan, then the material balance sheet of the entire national economy will only have "consumption" and no "resources".

The technical organization measures plan is closely related to all plan parts, and its relationship with the production plan is even more important, which everyone understands. The preparation of the production plan should consider the realization effect of the technical organization measures plan and incorporate it into the production plan. However, the competent authority often does not make a comprehensive consideration when approving the plan. The effect of realizing the technical organization measures in the production plan has been recognized by the competent planning department and included in the approved instructions. However, the technical organization measures plan is not approved. In this way, the technical measures for the enterprise to improve product quality, increase product quantity, and reduce material consumption quotas will fail. As a result, the completion of the plan still has not obtained technical guarantees. This is also an unbalanced, unconnected, and frequently occurring general phenomenon in planning.

Late Approval, Slow Delivery

After the annual plan and quarterly plan are painstakingly compiled and submitted on time, we expect the superior competent authority to review and approve them in a timely manner. However, in fact, it often sinks like a stone into the sea, without any news. We have now begun to understand the "work rules" of the superior authorities. The annual plan can probably be approved and issued one month before the end of the plan year, and the quarterly plan can probably be approved and issued about twenty days before the end of the plan quarter. The plan is approved so late and delivered so slowly, how can it guide production?

Spur the Horse

In addition to compiling the annual plan and quarterly plan, the economic planning staff of the enterprise must, of course, issue monthly technical and economic indicators and accounting plans to the workshops every month to check the implementation of the plan. In this way, we can only stay in the office and work every day, compiling one plan after another. Not only that, we also have to prepare materials and send materials to the superiors and outsiders. In addition to sending regular monthly reports and quarterly reports, we also have to send the plan implementation report forms for each ten days stipulated by the province and city; there are also the monthly and quarterly enterprise economic activity analysis reports stipulated by the ministry and bureau; these all require time and manpower. The city's tax bureau has even closer ties with us. They come every few days, just like a cousin visiting a younger female cousin at her grandmother's house, asking whether the plan has changed and what has changed, because they want to plan tax revenue. All these tasks need to be done, but we are too busy to cope, and sometimes we inevitably become sloppy and perfunctory.

Speaking of the economic activity analysis report that the bureau stipulates that enterprises should submit every month and quarter, I would also like to say a few words. The bureau stipulates that the enterprise's quarterly economic activity analysis report should be submitted five days before the end of the quarter, and the monthly economic activity analysis report should be submitted five days after the end of the month. The content of the quarterly economic activity analysis is required to be comprehensive, including production, labor, cost, finance, material supply, and commodity sales. In order to submit it on time, the enterprise must prepare all the materials ten days before the end of the quarter. Therefore, the figures and situation of product output and output value can only be estimated; the commodity sales situation can only be estimated (because the current transportation is tight, it cannot be "estimated", only "estimated"); the cost and profit must of course be analyzed, but what to do without materials? Therefore, the actual average of two months is used to extrapolate. In this way, it is also reported. However, it is also strange that the superior authorities have never corrected our practices, and the leading authorities probably think that our practice is also "not impossible". However, we know that this is not "analysis", but "rough estimate". I doubt what role such economic activity analysis reports have played for the leaders of the ministry and bureau?

Now, from the leaders of the ministry and bureau to our grass-roots staff, we all understand that "management is lagging behind production" and needs to catch up immediately. The Worker's Daily has also opened a special column of "Office Work Should Spur the Horse" to study this issue. I would like to ask, how to "spur the horse"? Unless we first free our feet and not tie them to the desk, and then use the whip to drive them, then we can think of running. Because only calling "spur the horse", while the feet are still tied to the desk, even if you shout until your throat is broken, it is useless. Taking our economic planning section of six people as an example, no one has stayed in the workshop for two consecutive hours throughout the year. I myself have not been to the workshop for five months and twelve days. Of course, this account cannot be counted on the superiors, but if you want to go to the workshop, where is the time! If people don't go to the workshop, how can they talk about going deep into production practice to investigate economic activities!

I hope that the industrial management department will change the working procedures of grass-roots planning work. Let us truly go deep into the reality of production and let our plans truly play a role in organizing production correctly.

### 对计划工作的意见

    对计划工作的意见
    浙江嘉兴民丰造纸厂  叶友堂
    作为一个工业企业的经济计划工作人员，我想谈谈当前工业企业计划工作的若干问题，供工业管理部门参考。
    下得迟　要得急
    大家都晓得，工业企业的年度生产技术财务计划是在国家颁发了计划控制数字后开始编制的（当然，在这以前还有年度生产技术财务计划建议数的工作，这个姑且不谈）。这个计划关系到整个企业全年的工作，编制这个计划，需要上自厂长，中至经济计划人员和技术人员，下至全体工人群众，还有企业的党群政治工作人员一道参加。只有这样才能保证计划体现出党的路线，才能保证计划在技术上的可靠性和经济上的合理性。但要发动这么多人来参加计划工作，就需要一定的时间，在苏联，通常是两个月。可是，在我们这里，上级主管机关的控制数字下达得很迟，每年11月份下达下一年的控制数字已经算是早的了。今年，我厂编制1957年计划草案的控制数字，上级是在11月30日下达的，而要求企业上报计划草案的时间却是12月15日。这就是说，企业应该在十五天内编好计划草案上报。这样一个牵动全盘的工作，要求企业在半个月内交卷，真是不堪设想。
    年度计划按理说应该是一年编一次，但我们却是一年二次、三次。就以我厂1956年年度生产计划来说吧！除了年度计划建议数工作外，在1955年年底编了1956年计划，这算是计划草案，呈报上级审批。1956年3月，根据上级指示，进行全面修正，称为修正计划草案，再报上级批示。1956年10月，又根据上级指示，编制第三次修正年度计划草案，呈报上级批示，直到我写这篇文章时（12月12日）还没有得到批准，而且还不知道是否会通知再修正一次。
    年度计划一次又一次的编过后，每季都要编制季度计划。一年有四季，明文规定就应该编四次。季度计划与年度计划一样，也是“全武行”的，有生产、有劳动、有物资供应、有成本财务、也有技术组织措施，它的全名称为“季度生产技术财务计划”。而且所用的表格也与年度计划差不多，可以说是一样多。
    如果说季度计划每季都只编一次，还应该说是省事的。可是，上级的目的是为了计划正确，保证顺利执行，于是，也仿照年度计划的编制程序，先来一次建议数工作，然后再编计划草案。至于规定企业的编制时间，当然不能超过年度计划的编制时间，最多也只能是十天、半月，限期上报。上报以后怎么办呢？上级是否马上批？什么时候可以批复？谁也答不上来。结果是：生产归生产，计划归计划。要是等到上级批了再生产，那么谁也不要生产了。所以，我们只有一面生产，一面静候上级批，十天、半月、一月、两月……
        变更多　脱节多
    如果说，只是计划编制的次数多，编好计划以后都能顺利地执行，那末，多编几次也还值得。作为一个经济计划人员，本来就不应该贪懒，多编几次计划有什么理由可以怨天怨地呢？可是，现实情况却不如此。年度计划多变现在已经成为习惯，习惯成自然，大家都认为不足为奇了。说起多变的原因来，我们这样说，上级也这样说，这就是：“客观实际不能在编制计划时都考虑周到。”当然，这也是实际情况。我并不是主张完全不考虑客观因素，计划定了就不能再变；而是说，现在计划是变得太多了。
    不仅年度计划经常变，就连季度计划也是经常变的。产品数量经常变，产品规格经常变，甚至产品品种也经常变。上级要求企业变更计划不打紧，一纸公文、一张电报都可以下达命令，只是苦坏了企业。大的变更要改变劳动组织，采办他种原料，小的变更也要调整设备，考虑技术措施。这样的大小变更，一年都有七、八次。我厂仅今年第三季度，计划外生产的产品就有五种。这样做，不但浪费了大量的人力、物力，而且还使生产技术准备工作无法按正常程序布置和进行，影响正常生产。我们厂的月度计划也曾经几次被任务变更所打乱。这种做法，也影响了工人群众的生产积极性。
    计划多变的另一个严重后果就是破坏了生产技术财务计划各个组成部分的平衡衔接。由于变更产品品种和规格，企业需要调整劳动组织和采用新的技术措施，这就不得不打破劳动计划和成本、利润计划，影响了企业计划的全面完成。而当上级指示修正计划时，通常只对生产计划进行修正，对于其他计划部分则没有全盘考虑。
    各个计划部分不平衡、不衔接如果都仅仅是由于计划变更所造成的，那也不是最重要的，只要上级在变更生产计划时相应调整其他计划部分就好了。但是，实际情况却不然。有许多情况表明完全是由于主管机关的主观主义所造成的。例如，生产计划还没有确定，甚至连控制数字也未下达，主管机关就要求企业编制物资供应计划，而且上报日期也比生产计划早得多。如我厂1957年第一季度物资预拨计划早在11月25日就上报中央了。但是，1957年的生产计划控制数字还是在11月30日下达的。在当时，生产计划根本没有动手编制。再如商品交货计划也走在生产计划的前面，我厂1957年第一季度供货计划已在11月7日提出，而第一季度的生产计划目前还未着手进行。这种脱节现象应该是由谁负责任呢？我很奇怪：如果全国所有的工业企业都是先编物资供应计划而后编生产计划，那末，整个国民经济的物资平衡表就将是只有“消费”而无“资源”了。
    技术组织措施计划同各个计划部分都有密切关联，同生产计划的关联更是重要，这一点不管谁都是明白的。生产计划的编制要考虑技术组织措施计划的实现效果，并把它纳入生产计划中去。但是，主管机关在审批计划时，往往不作全面考虑，生产计划中关于实现技术组织措施后的效果，已经主管计划的部门认可了，并列入批准的指令内。可是，技术组织措施计划却不批准。这样，企业对于提高产品质量、增加产品数量和降低物资消费定额的技术措施就要落空。于是，计划的完成仍旧没有获得技术上的保证。这也是计划不平衡、不衔接而且是经常发生的一个普遍现象。
        批准迟　下达慢
    年度计划和季度计划辛辛苦苦的按期编好上报后，满望上级主管机关及时审查，及时批准，可是，事实上却常常如石沉大海，音讯全无。我们现在也已经开始摸到上级机关的“工作规律”了。年度计划大概在计划年末前一个多月可以批准下达，季度计划大概在计划季末前二十天左右可以批准下达。计划批准得这么迟，下达得这么慢，怎么能够指导生产呢？
              快马加鞭
    企业的经济计划人员，除了编制年度计划和季度计划外，每月当然还要给各车间下达月度的技术经济指标和核算计划执行情况。这样，我们只有每天呆在办公室里忙；编完一个计划接着一个计划。不但如此，我们还要经常为上级和外界准备资料和报送资料。除了报送定期的月报、季报外，还要报送省、市规定的每旬计划执行情况报告表；也有部和局规定的每月和每季的企业经济活动分析报告书；这些都是需要花时间、花人力的。而市的税务局同我们的交道打得更热，他们三天两日来，就像表兄到外婆家看表妹一样，询问计划有否变更，变了什么，因为他们要计划税收。所有这些工作，都是需要做的，但是我们忙不过来，有时候就不免马虎潦草，敷衍将就。
    提起局里规定企业应该在每月和每季报送的经济活动分析报告书，我还想说几句话。局规定企业的季度经济活动分析报告书应在季末前五天报出，月度经济活动分析报告书应在月末后五天前报出。对于季度经济活动分析的内容，要求全面，既要包括生产、劳动；也要包括成本、财务和物资供应及商品销售的情况。为了按期报送，企业就必须在季末前十天准备好一切资料。于是，产品产量和产值的数字和情况只能预计；商品销售情况只能估计（因为当前运输紧张，“预计”不了，只有“估计”）；成本、利润当然也要分析，但是，没有资料怎么办？于是，就用两个月的实际平均来推算。这样，也就报出去了。但是，也奇怪，上级机关一次也没有纠正过我们的做法，大概领导机关认为我们这种做法也是“未尝不可”的。不过，我们自己晓得：这不是“分析”，而是“毛估”。我很怀疑，这样的经济活动分析报告书对部、局领导机关到底起了那些作用？
    现在，自部、局领导机关直至我们基层的工作人员，都明白“管理落后于生产”，需要立即赶上去，工人日报还特地辟了一个“科室工作要快马加鞭”的专栏来研究这个问题。我想，怎样“快马加鞭”呢？除非是首先让我们两只脚解放出来，不要系在办公桌边，然后再用鞭来驱策，这样，想是可以跑起来。因为光叫“快马加鞭”，而两脚仍旧缚在办公桌上，即使喊破喉咙叫，也是没有用的。就以我们经济计划科六个人来说吧，一年内，谁也没有在车间里连续呆过二小时。我自己已经有五个月又十二天没有到车间去了，当然这笔账不能算在上级身上，可是，要下车间，那有时间呢！人不到车间去，怎能谈得上深入生产实际去考察经济活动呢！
    希望工业管理部门改变基层计划工作的工作程序。让我们真正深入到生产实际中去，让我们的计划真正起到正确地组织生产的作用。
