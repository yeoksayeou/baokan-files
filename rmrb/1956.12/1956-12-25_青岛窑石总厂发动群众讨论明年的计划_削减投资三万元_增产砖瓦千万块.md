    This newspaper reports that the leading cadres of the Qingdao Kiln and Stone General Factory went deep into the branch factories and handed over the 1957 production plan to the masses for discussion. According to preliminary statistics from the discussions in just four branch factories, it is possible to reduce basic construction costs by more than 30,000 yuan and increase brick and tile production by nearly 10 million pieces.

    The Qingdao Kiln and Stone General Factory's 1957 production plan was formulated based on the brisk sales of bricks and tiles this year and the expected increase in sales next year. Building new factories and expanding equipment were regarded as the main means to complete next year's task, and the amount of investment in basic construction was very large. Despite this, some branch factory directors still complained, worried that they would not be able to complete the increased production task next year.

    Is this plan realistic and feasible? The leading cadres of the Qingdao Municipal Light Industry Bureau and the General Factory were determined to take the plan to the masses to seek their advice and let the masses make a correct assessment. After they went down, they focused on organizing experienced veteran technical workers, work section chiefs, team leaders, and office cadres to discuss together. Because the significance of increasing production and practicing economy was explained to the masses before the discussion, everyone was able to closely connect with the actual situation of their own workshop and work section to carefully calculate and strive to tap the potential for increased production. For example, the Second Branch Factory was blocked when discussing the increase in machine-made bricks, and the focus was on how to improve blank-making efficiency. Old technician Jia Xianrui, who had been operating brick machines for decades, stared at the ceiling and calculated for a long time before stomping his foot and saying, "There is no problem in increasing the machine brick axle speed by five revolutions per minute next year. We used to run it at 45 revolutions per minute when we were rushing tasks (this year it's only 40 revolutions per minute), and I've tested the machine many times with my hands and it's always ice cold." This suggestion was deemed feasible after everyone discussed it. This would increase the output by 25 bricks per machine per minute. If the blank-making efficiency is improved, can the next blank-cutting process cut them out? Young blank-cutter Zhang Kuanzhai was initially frightened by the task assigned to him by the previous process. But after careful calculation, he felt that he could do it if he worked harder. He put forward this opinion for everyone to study. After careful calculation, everyone helped him come up with a way to add an extra cutting blade to the original blank-cutting platform, and the imbalance in this process was quickly resolved. In this way, as a result of one link after another in the discussion, the blank-making workshop of the Second Branch Factory alone can increase the production of 2 million brick blanks next year. The leading cadres of the Second Branch Factory, who had doubts about increasing production next year, also began to gain confidence.

    In the discussion of basic construction investment projects, the workers, with a responsible attitude as masters of their own affairs, conducted serious discussions based on facts. They firmly grasped the principle of "spend what should be spent, save what can be saved" and cut out many unnecessary investment projects in the original plan. When the workers of the Eighth Branch Factory discussed the plan to build four new tile-drying sheds at their factory next year, they first calculated the potential of the existing tile-drying sheds and believed that as long as they could fully utilize the gaps that had not been used in the past, they could accommodate more than 30,000 additional tile blanks. In this way, it would be enough to build only two new tile sheds. The stone crusher, which costs more than 4,000 yuan each, was planned to be purchased and installed in the Second Branch Factory next year. After the workers found out, they made a serious criticism of this project. Cutter Jia Zesheng said: This is because the person who compiled the plan did not see the changed situation. After the Second Branch Factory moved this year, the soil used is different. Now it is the soil from the new soil yard, which has high viscosity and few gravels. The two old stone crushers are enough. Because this matter is related to the quality of brick making, everyone suggested rationally adjusting the roller distance of the old stone crushers for the sake of prudence. In this way, even without adding new stone crushers, it would be sufficient to ensure the quality of the bricks.

### 青岛窑石总厂发动群众讨论明年的计划  削减投资三万元  增产砖瓦千万块

    青岛窑石总厂发动群众讨论明年的计划
    削减投资三万元  增产砖瓦千万块
    本报讯　青岛窑石总厂的领导干部，深入分厂，把1957年生产计划交付群众讨论。仅据四个分厂初步讨论的结果统计，即可削减基本建设费用三万多元，增产砖瓦近一千万块。
    窑石总厂1957年的生产计划，是依据今年砖瓦脱销和明年销量加大的情况编制的，筹建新厂和扩建设备被视为完成明年任务的主要手段，基本建设投资的数目很大。尽管如此，有些分厂长还是叫苦，担心明年完不成增产任务。
    这个计划是否实际可行呢？青岛市轻工业局和总厂的领导干部，决心把计划拿到群众中去向群众讨教，让群众作出正确鉴定。他们下去以后，有重点地组织了生产经验丰富的老技术工人、工段长、小组长和科室干部一起讨论。因为讨论之前先向群众交代了增产节约的意义，所以大家都能紧密联系本车间本工段的实际情况精打细算，努力发掘增产的潜力。比如二分厂在讨论到机砖增产时一下被挡住了，焦点在如何提高制坯效率上。开了几十年砖机的老技工贾显瑞，眼瞅着天花板算了半天账，一顿脚说：“明年的机砖轮轴每分钟再提高五转没问题。过去赶任务时曾经开到四十五转（今年只开四十转），我用手试了多次机器都是冰凉的。”这个建议经过大家讨论都认为能行得通。这一下每台机每一分钟就可多出二十五块砖。制坯效率提高了，下道铡坯工序能不能铡出呢？青年铡坯工张宽斋开始被上道工序加给他的任务吓了一大跳。但细细算了一下，认为紧一点也能干出来。他把这个意见提出来让大家研究。经过算细账，大家又帮他想出了在原铡坯台上多加一把割刀的办法，于是这道工序不平衡的问题迅速解决了。就这样，一环扣一环讨论的结果，只二分厂制坯车间明年就可增产二百万块砖坯。原来对明年增产有疑虑的二分厂领导干部，信心也开始增强起来。
    在讨论基本建设投资项目中，工人们更以当家做主的负责态度，实事求是的做了认真讨论，他们紧紧掌握“该花的要花，能省的就省”的原则，把原计划中许多不必要的投资项目削减掉。八分厂工人在讨论到明年他们厂要新盖四幢晾瓦棚时，首先核算了现有晾瓦棚的潜力，认为只要能把过去没有利用过的空隙充分利用，就可多容纳三万多块瓦坯。这样只要新盖两幢瓦棚就够了。四千多元一部的碎石机，计划中是准备明年买来安在二分厂里的。工人们知道后，对这个项目提出了严肃批评。推铡工贾泽生说：这是编计划的人没有看到已经变化了的情况。二分厂今年搬家后，所用的土质不一样了，现在是用新土场里的土，粘性大、砂石少，旧有的那两部碎石机就够用了。因为这事关系到制砖质量，大家为了慎重起见，又建议合理调整旧有的碎石机滚距。这样，即使不新添碎石机，也足可以保证砖的质量。
