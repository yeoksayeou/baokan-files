Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: A report from TASS states that one evening in late December, the passionate singing of the famous American singer Paul Robeson traveled through thousands of kilometers of undersea, underground, and aerial wires to the Akmolinsk reclamation area in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union. At the request of the Soviet reclamation youth, he sang a song in Russian called "Night" on the phone to celebrate the upcoming New Year of 1957.

　　In the Krasivensky State Farm in the Akmolinsk reclamation area, the widest street has been named Paul Robeson Street. When welcoming the New Year, the youth on the street made a long-distance call to their friend Robeson, who lived far away in New York, to wish him a happy New Year. Soviet youth tractor driver Goreznik told the famous peace fighter on the phone that the reclamation youth brought records of Robeson's singing programs to the wilderness, and his beautiful singing resounded after the first canvas tent was set up on the prairie. Goreznik also said to Robeson, we regard you as one of the honorary members of our harmonious state farm. We salute you and extend the hand of youth friendship from our motherland to you. Please convey our best wishes to the American youth.

　　Robeson said on the phone: I cherish your friendship, and I love you too. Robeson also expressed that he would very much like to go to Moscow for the New Year.

　　Mrs. Robeson also participated in the conversation. She warmly congratulated the Soviet youth on the phone and especially extended her greetings to the Soviet women.

    美国“铁幕”挡不住人民的友情
    保罗·罗伯逊在电话里给苏联青年唱歌
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社报道：在12月下旬的一天晚上，美国著名的歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊的热情洋溢的歌声，通过几千公里的海底、地下和空中电线，传到了苏联哈萨克共和国阿克摩林斯克垦荒区。他在电话上应苏联垦荒青年的请求，用俄语唱了一支歌曲“夜晚”，以祝贺1957年新年的即将来临。
    在阿克摩林斯克垦荒区的克拉西文斯克国营农场里，一条最宽阔的街道被命名为保罗·罗伯逊街。街道上的青年在迎接新年的时候，给远住在纽约的友人罗伯逊打了一个长途电话，向他祝贺新年。苏联青年拖拉机手戈列斯尼克在电话中告诉这位著名的和平战士，垦荒青年把灌制罗伯逊歌唱节目的唱片带到了荒地来，在草原上的第一个帆布帐篷建立起来以后他的动听的歌声就响起来了。戈列斯尼克还对罗伯逊说，我们认为你是我们和睦的国营农场的名誉成员之一。我们向你致敬，并且将我们祖国青年友谊的手伸给你。请你向美国青年转达我们最好的祝愿。
    罗伯逊在电话中说：我珍视你们的友爱，我也爱你们。罗伯逊还表示，他很想在新年里能够到莫斯科去。
  　罗伯逊夫人也参加了谈话。她在电话中热烈地向苏联青年祝贺，并且特别向苏联妇女致意。
