Xinhua News Agency, December 25th -- According to a report by the Romanian News Agency on December 24th: Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Armed Forces, Münnich, said when meeting with some Romanian journalists that the number of Hungarian citizens who went abroad in the past two months and are returning home is rapidly increasing. To date, the number of Hungarian citizens who have returned home is nearly seven thousand.

Those who have returned home have denounced some people who fled Hungary for trying to slander their motherland in exchange for a little money. Most of those who fled Hungary are honest people, including young people and children, who, after understanding the situation, hope to return home as soon as possible. The Hungarian government has taken measures to enable these citizens to return home quickly. However, the Hungarian government's efforts have been met with an incomprehensible attitude from the Austrian government, which has refused to allow representatives of the Hungarian Embassy in Vienna to inform Hungarian citizens about their opportunities to return home and assist them in returning home. In Austrian refugee camps, the majority of Hungarian citizens, especially young people and children, are desperately demanding permission to return home, but are being obstructed by certain forces who are doing their best to prevent them from returning.

    匈牙利公民回国者日多
    新华社25日讯　据罗马尼亚通讯社24日讯：匈牙利工农革命政府副总理兼武装部队部长明尼赫在接见一些罗马尼亚记者的时候说，在过去两个月中到国外去的匈牙利公民回国的人的数目正在迅速增长。到目前为止，回国的匈牙利公民的数目将近七千人。
    那些回国的人痛斥某些逃出匈牙利的人试图污蔑他们的祖国，以此来换取一点金钱。逃出匈牙利的人当中大多数是正直的人们，包括青年和儿童，他们在明白过来以后，希望尽速回国。匈牙利政府已经采取措施来使这些公民迅速回国。但是匈牙利政府的努力遇到了奥地利政府不可理解的态度，它竟拒绝让匈牙利驻维也纳使馆代表告诉匈牙利公民关于他们回国的机会和协助他们回国。在奥地利的收容所中，大多数匈牙利公民、特别是青年和儿童，竭力要求允许他们回国，但是受到了正在尽量不让他们回国的某种势力的阻挠。
