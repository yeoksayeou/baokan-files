To advance the main sectors of the national economy—industry, agriculture, transportation, and construction—from a state of extreme technical backwardness to the track of modern technology, to greatly develop the social productive forces, and to greatly increase labor productivity is the fundamental goal of our country's implementation of an active policy of socialist industrialization. To realize the technical transformation of the national economy, the primary issue lies in establishing a technologically advanced industrial system, the center of which is the machine-building industry.

In order to establish a technical foundation capable of transforming the national economy with modern technology, we carried out large-scale industrial construction during the first Five-Year Plan period, paying full attention to the construction of the machine-building and metallurgical industries. At the same time, we adopted modern advanced technology and equipment in newly built industrial enterprises, especially those large-scale industrial enterprises designed with Soviet assistance. We carried out partial technical innovations in existing industrial enterprises. However, due to the weak original industrial base and the extreme backwardness of industrial technology in our country, the current production level of the machine-building and metallurgical industries, upon which the technical transformation of our national economy depends, is still very low. It is difficult not only to meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy in terms of the quantity of products but also to meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy in terms of the variety and quality of products. This situation determines that the process of technical transformation of our national economy cannot be too fast and must be carried out step by step.

The technical transformation of the national economy, of course, not only involves transforming the technology of industry but also transforming the technology of agriculture, transportation, construction, etc., but the focus must first be placed on industry. In industry, of course, not only the technology of heavy industry must be transformed, but also the technology of light industry and handicrafts, but the focus must be placed on heavy industry, especially the metallurgical and machine-building industries. The reason why we must adopt a policy of focused transformation in the work of technical transformation is that only such a policy can truly accelerate the speed of technical transformation of the national economy, rather than delay its speed. Everyone knows that the technical transformation of the national economy depends on the machine-building industry to provide a large number of machines and equipment; and the development of the machine-building industry depends on the metallurgical industry to provide a large number of raw materials. If these two industrial sectors are not developed, it is impossible to realize the technical transformation of the national economy. Therefore, dispersing efforts and promoting the technical transformation of various sectors of the national economy evenly will inevitably delay the speed of technical transformation of the national economy. Conversely, first concentrating efforts on the technical transformation of heavy industry, especially the machine-building and metallurgical industries, and seeking to establish an advanced technical foundation as soon as possible will accelerate the speed of technical transformation of the national economy.

Our adoption of a policy of focused transformation in technical transformation, of course, cannot be interpreted as focusing only on the key points and neglecting other aspects. The requirements of various sectors of our national economy for technical transformation are becoming more urgent day by day. It is impossible not to take care of other aspects. Therefore, in the future, the domestic machine-building industry should produce as much machinery and equipment as possible, and strive to import a part of machinery and equipment to supply the needs of various sectors of the national economy for technical transformation.

When we promote the technical transformation of the national economy, we must combine it with the arrangement of labor force. We must not only continuously improve the level of mechanization in various sectors of the national economy, but also make full use of the favorable conditions of our country's abundant labor resources. For example, in agriculture, production can be improved through the rational organization of labor after overall cooperation. If we unilaterally pursue mechanization, there will inevitably be a waste of labor force and phenomena that are difficult to arrange. Therefore, our transformation of agriculture is to first implement cooperation and then implement certain reforms in agricultural technology without rushing to consider the issue of mechanization. In industries such as construction and handicrafts, because our country has a relatively large labor force and has many special production technologies, we cannot unilaterally implement mechanization across the board. Instead, some parts should be mechanized, and some parts may not be mechanized; or, some parts may be mechanized first, and some parts may be mechanized later.

The original technical equipment of our country's industry, transportation, and other sectors, although relatively backward and complicated, must still be fully utilized. On the premise of full utilization, they should be transformed. Newly built and major reconstruction of industrial and transportation enterprises cannot require all technical equipment to be the most advanced. The technical transformation of our national economy, although it can receive foreign aid, must not deviate from our country's existing industrial level. The use of electric locomotives and internal combustion locomotives on railways, and the installation of high-temperature, high-pressure, and large-capacity generator sets in power stations can achieve higher efficiency and are more economically and technically reasonable. If possible, they should be adopted. However, in the case where it is difficult to import more equipment and domestic production is not possible, we must give priority to using domestically produced equipment. Although the technology of these equipment is not very advanced and the quality is not first-rate, using them will not delay the country's construction and the progress of technical transformation. Of course, the machine-building and metallurgical industrial sectors should step up their efforts to improve technology and produce advanced machinery and equipment and high-quality raw materials in as short a time as possible.

In the process of technical transformation, we must also combine the manufacture of machinery and equipment with natural conditions. For example, we must determine the development direction of power equipment and transportation equipment based on our country's fuel resources, water resources, and climatic and topographic conditions; we must determine the development direction of tractors and agricultural machinery based on our country's geography and agricultural product planting conditions; and we must determine the composition of various fertilizers and their proportions based on the distribution of our country's soil and crops.

Advanced technology is an important material condition for developing social productive forces and improving labor productivity. However, technology must be operated by people. The degree to which technology plays its role does not depend on the technology itself, but on whether the labor organization is reasonable and whether the technical management is perfect. Some enterprises and departments unilaterally pay attention to technical transformation, but pay little attention to improving labor organization and raising the level of technical management. Therefore, this situation often occurs: the technology is advanced, but the production is backward. The unit area yield of crops in some state-owned mechanized farms is not as good as that of general agricultural production cooperatives; some basic construction units with a relatively high degree of mechanization have construction speeds that are not as good as those of basic construction units with a relatively low degree of mechanization. This extremely abnormal situation, on the one hand, shows that we must never adopt an "idol worship" attitude towards modern technology; on the other hand, it also shows that we must improve labor organization and technical management while carrying out technical transformation. Otherwise, technical transformation will not achieve the desired results, and may even affect the development of productivity and the improvement of labor productivity for a certain period of time. Of course, it is also wrong to negate all original production methods and management systems without analysis and to negate all useful experiences. We should strive to closely and correctly combine technical transformation with the improvement of labor organization and technical management work, so as to maximize the role of advanced technology.

    有步骤地推进国民经济的技术改造
    把国民经济的主要部门——工业、农业、运输业和建筑业从技术极端落后的状况推进到现代化技术的轨道上，极大地发展社会生产力和极大地提高劳动生产率，是我国实行积极的社会主义工业化政策的根本目的。而要实现国民经济的技术改造，首要的问题在于建立起一个技术先进的工业体系，这个工业体系的中心是机器制造业。
    为了建立一个能够用现代技术改造国民经济的技术基础，我们在第一个五年计划期间，进行了大规模的工业建设，充分注意了机器制造工业和冶金工业的建设。同时，我们在新建的工业企业中，特别是那些由苏联帮助设计的大型工业企业中，采用了现代先进的技术装备。我们对原有的工业企业，进行了部分的技术革新。但是，由于我国原有的工业基础薄弱和工业技术极端落后，我国国民经济技术改造所依靠的机器制造工业和冶金工业，目前的生产水平还很低，不仅产品的数量方面不能满足国民经济各部门的需要，而且在产品的品种和质量方面更难于满足国民经济各部门的需要。这种状况，就决定了我国国民经济的技术改造的进程不可能太快，而必须有步骤地进行。
    国民经济的技术改造，当然不只要改造工业的技术，而且要改造农业、运输业和建筑业等等的技术，但是重点必须首先放在工业方面。在工业中，当然不只要改造重工业的技术，而且要改造轻工业和手工业的技术，但是重点必须放在重工业，特别是冶金工业和机器制造工业。我们所以必须在技术改造这个工作中采取重点改造的方针，这是因为，只有这样的方针，才能够真正加快国民经济技术改造的速度，而不致延缓它的速度。大家知道，国民经济的技术改造，要依靠机器制造工业来提供大量的机器设备；而机器制造工业的发展又要依靠冶金工业来提供大量的原材料。在这两个工业部门不发达的情况下，就不可能实现国民经济的技术改造。因此，分散使用力量，平均地推进国民经济各部门技术改造的结果，就必然要延缓国民经济技术改造的速度。相反，首先集中力量进行重工业特别是机器制造工业和冶金工业的技术改造，求得尽快地建立一个先进的技术基础，就将加快国民经济技术改造的速度。
    我们在技术改造中采取重点改造的方针，这当然不能解释为可以只注意重点，而不顾其他。我国国民经济各部门对技术改造的要求，一天比一天迫切。不照顾其他方面是不行的。因此，今后国内的机器制造工业，应该尽可能多地生产机器设备，并且争取进口一部分机器设备，供应国民经济各部门技术改造的需要。
    我们在推进国民经济技术改造的时候，必须同劳动力的安排相结合。我们既要不断提高国民经济各部门的机械化程度，又要充分利用我国劳动力资源丰富的有利条件。例如在农业中，在全面合作化以后就能够合理组织劳动力而提高生产，如果片面地追求机械化，就必然会发生劳动力的浪费和难以安排的现象。因此，我们对农业的改造，是先实行合作化，而后实行农业技术的某些改革而不急于考虑机械化问题。又如在建筑业和手工业中，因为我国劳动力比较多，而且有不少特殊的生产技术，也就不能片面地一律实行机械化，而是有些部分应当实行机械化，有些部分就可以不实行机械化；或者，有些部分可以先实行机械化，有些部分可以后实行机械化。
    我国的工业，交通运输业和其他一些部门原有的技术设备虽然比较落后和比较复杂，但是仍然必须加以充分利用。在充分利用的前提下，对它们进行改造。新建和重大改建的工业企业和交通运输企业，也不能要求一切技术设备都是最先进的。我国国民经济的技术改造，虽然可以得到国外的援助，但是决不能离开我国现有的工业水平。在铁路上采用电气机车和内燃机车，在电站中装置高温高压和大容量的发电机组，都可以发挥更高的效率，在经济上技术上比较合理，如有可能，是应当采用的。但是，在进口更多的设备有困难和国内不能制造的情况下，我们也就必须尽先地采用国内生产的设备。这些设备的技术固然并不是很先进的，质量也不是头等的，可是利用它们，就可以不致耽误国家的建设，不致耽误技术改造的进展。当然，机器制造工业部门和冶金工业部门，应当加紧努力，在尽可能短的时间内提高技术，生产先进的机器设备和质量高的原材料。
    在技术改造的过程中，我们还必须使机器设备的制造同自然条件相结合。例如，我们必须根据我国燃料资源和水力资源以及气候、地形的状况，确定动力设备和运输设备的发展方向；要根据我国的地理和农产品种植的状况，确定拖拉机和农业机器的发展方向；并且要根据我国土壤和农作物分布的状况，确定各种肥料的成份和它们之间的比例。
    先进的技术是发展社会生产力和提高劳动生产率重要的物质条件。但是，技术是要靠人来操纵的。技术作用的发挥程度，不决定于技术本身，而取决于劳动组织是否合理和技术管理是否完善。有些企业和部门，片面地注意技术改造，但对改善劳动组织和提高技术管理水平则很少注意。因此，常常出现这种情况：技术是先进的，但生产则是落后的。有些国营机械化农场，农作物的单位面积产量还不及一般的农业生产合作社；有些机械化程度比较高的基本建设单位，建设的速度还不如机械化程度比较低的基本建设单位。这种极不正常的状况，一方面说明了我们决不应当对现代化技术采取“崇拜偶像”的态度，另一方面也说明了我们在进行技术改造的时候，必须同时改善劳动组织和技术管理工作。否则，技术改造就不能收到应有的效果，甚至在一定时间内还会影响生产力的发展和劳动生产率的提高。当然，不加分析地否定一切原有的生产方法和管理制度，否定一切有用的经验，也是不对的。我们应当努力把技术改造同改善劳动组织和技术管理工作密切地正确地结合起来，以便最大限度地发挥先进技术的作用。
