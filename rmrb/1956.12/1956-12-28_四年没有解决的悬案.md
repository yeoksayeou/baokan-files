Title: A Four-Year-Old Unresolved Case

A flat remittance fee of 2 jiao is charged for all remittances under 300 yuan, regardless of the amount. Many people have voiced concerns about this regulation, saying that it only considers the convenience of the post office's work and neglects whether it is reasonable.

As the ancients said, "To err is human, to correct is divine." As long as the post office is willing to listen to the opinions of the masses and revise the method, this is not a big deal. Regrettably, the post office has adopted a delaying and evasive attitude towards this matter. If you don't believe me, please see the post office's reply to the public's opinions below.

"Regarding the remittance fee, after detailed study, a revised plan has been drafted and will be implemented after being submitted to the Central Financial and Economic Commission for approval." (See News Daily, April 3, 1953)

"The Central Financial and Economic Commission has given instructions on the adjustment plan, and we have re-drafted the plan in accordance with the instructions and are still awaiting approval." (News Daily, September 23, 1953)

"The current postal remittance method stipulates that a remittance fee of 2 jiao is charged for remittances from 1 yuan to 300 yuan, and a registered letter must be sent separately. The method is not reasonable enough. At present, we are studying the Soviet Union's remittance methods and starting a thorough reform of the remittance system." (People's Daily, August 10 this year)

"Because these problems involve the entire remittance system and various aspects of fee grading, it is necessary to conduct detailed investigations and studies and widely listen to opinions from various places, so the time has been relatively long. At present, this issue is approaching the final stage of resolution, and soon a new remittance method will be announced." (News Daily, September 9 this year)

From the beginning of 1953 to now, nearly four years have passed. Four years is not a short time. During this period, our great country of 600 million people has undergone tremendous changes and is advancing at such a rapid pace! However, the post office has been "studying in detail" such a seemingly not very difficult matter, "studying" and "studying," but unable to "study" a concrete result. Why is the new remittance method so difficult to produce? What is the reason? It is said that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is determined to change the current remittance method, but they want to reform it together with other postal and telecommunications charges such as parcels, telephones, and telegrams; because some reforms are still under study, the change in the remittance method has been delayed. I think, although comprehensive reform is good, but since it cannot be fully reformed for a while, why can't we change what should be changed and can be changed first? (Attached picture)

    四年没有解决的悬案
    流星
    汇款在三百元以下的，不论多少，一律付汇费二角。这个规定很多人都提过意见，说它只顾了邮局工作方便，不顾是否合理。
    古人说得好：“过而能改，善莫大焉”，只要邮局肯虚心听取群众的意见，把办法修改一下，这也不是什么大不了的事。令人遗憾的是：邮局却对这件事采取了拖延塞责的态度。不信，请看下面邮局对于群众意见的答复。
    “在汇费方面，经过详细研究，已拟就调整方案，俟呈请中央财政经济委员会核准后公布实行。”（见1953年4月3日新闻日报）
    “中央财政经济委员会对调整方案有所指示，我们已遵照指示重拟方案，仍候核示中。”（1953年9月23日新闻日报）
    “邮局现行汇款办法规定汇一元至三百元一律收汇费二角，还须另寄挂号信，办法是不够合理的。目前我们正学习苏联汇兑办法，从汇兑制度着手进行彻底改革。”（今年8月10日人民日报）
    “因为这些问题牵涉到整个汇兑制度以及收费分等各方面的问题，需要经过详细的调查研究，广泛听取各地意见，所以时间拖得比较长。目前这一问题已接近最后解决阶段，不久，即可公布一个新的汇款办法。”（今年9月9日新闻日报）
    从1953年初到现在，时间过去了将近四年。四年的时间可不算短，就在这段时间里，我们这个六亿人口的大国，起了多么大的变化，以多么快的速度在前进啊！然而邮局对于这样一件看来并不十分繁难的事情，却一直还在“详细研究”之中，“研究”来，“研究”去，“研究”不出一个具体结果。为什么新的汇款办法这样难产呢？原因到底何在呢？据说邮电部是决心要改变现行的汇款办法的，但是，他们要同包裹、电话、电报等其他各种邮电资费一同改革；因为有些改革尚待研究，汇款办法的改变也就拖下来了。我想，全面改革虽然好，但既然一时还不能全面改革，为什么不可以把应该改、能够改的先改一下呢？（附图片）
