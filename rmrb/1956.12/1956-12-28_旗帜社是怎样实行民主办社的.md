The Banner Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shigou Township, Junan County, Shandong Province, has seen a significant increase in farmer enthusiasm and improved crop yields over the past year, thanks to the diligent implementation of democratic cooperative management by the cooperative's Communist Party branch and management committee. The cooperative has 2,900 mu of land (over 60% of which is hilly), with an average grain yield of 402 jin per mu, an increase of 18 jin per mu compared to last year (compared to the yield of the 48 households in the old cooperative last year). Out of the 228 households in the cooperative, 217 households increased their income or maintained the same level, accounting for 95.2% of the total number of households in the cooperative, while only eleven households experienced a decrease in income.

**From a Few People Running the Cooperative to Everyone Running the Cooperative**

Hejiadian Village in Shigou Township began operating cooperatives in the winter of 1951. In the past few years, the branch and management committee did not understand how to implement democratic cooperative management, and the cooperative affairs were "controlled" by a few cadres who issued orders. Among the seven members of the management committee, only three were in charge, and the other members were "followers." The result of this approach was that "cooperative cadres pushed things outwards, and the members had a lot of opinions." Niu Ensheng, the director of the cooperative, and several other key cadres felt that they were "carrying their daughter-in-law on their backs, suffering the burden without any reward." Last winter, after the merger of five elementary cooperatives from two villages (Hejiadian and Zhoujiapozi) into one advanced cooperative, the Party branch and management committee summarized the lessons learned from the undemocratic operation of the cooperative in the past and decided to resolutely implement the policy of democratic cooperative management. At that time, Zhuang Zidiao and other members of the management committee said, "The cooperative is large, there are many people and opinions, and it is difficult to manage." Niu Ensheng, the director of the cooperative, He Dianfang, the secretary of the Party branch, and other comrades persuaded them with the lessons learned from the undemocratic operation of the cooperative in the past. The thirteen members of the management committee, in order to express their determination to implement democratic cooperative management, each wrote a guarantee, which stated: (1) Discuss matters with everyone and listen to the opinions of the masses; (2) Be selfless and serve the members well; (3) Share weal and woe with the members; (4) Strengthen unity, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and avoid arrogance and complacency.

**Discuss Matters with the Members**

How exactly to promote democracy? Initially, the management committee was still unsure. For example, when formulating the spring production plan, the thirteen members of the management committee gathered together and worked for three days, but the plan was still not finalized. The management committee felt that although it was a waste of time, it was still a matter of everyone discussing things, not a few people doing it alone. However, the members said: "Cooperative cadres can afford to waste work time, but we can't afford to make up for their wasted work time." The management committee listened to the opinions of the masses and changed this approach. They used methods such as convening forums with experienced farmers and talking with production team leaders and members to extensively collect the opinions of the members. Based on the opinions of the members and the requirements of the state, the main cadres were responsible for drafting the plan, which was then submitted to the branch committee, the management committee, the general meeting of Party members, and the members' meetings at the production team level for discussion and revision from the inside out and from top to bottom. Finally, it was submitted to the general meeting of members for discussion and revision. Only when the majority of members were satisfied was it adopted as a resolution of the general meeting of members and handed over to the management committee for implementation. This year, the nine annual, quarterly, and short-term production plans and the three preliminary and final distribution plans formulated within the cooperative were all done in this way. Because the Party branch and management committee discussed matters with the masses and listened to the opinions of the masses, the members established the idea of being masters of their own affairs, and many possible errors in leadership work were avoided. For example, in the spring high-yield competition, Niu Ensheng, the director of the cooperative, proposed a target of increasing production to 800 jin per mu according to the requirements of the higher authorities. The members unanimously felt that it was impossible to achieve and disagreed, criticizing Niu Ensheng, saying, "Don't be a braggart." The management committee listened to the opinions of the members and still implemented the original plan of contracting for an average of 400 jin per mu. As a result, the actual yield this year was an average of 402 jin per mu. During the summer planting season, the management committee planned to use the method of "old plows with plowshares" to plant soybeans, but the members pointed out that the soil was dry, and planting soybeans with plowshares would result in uneven seedling emergence, which would reduce production. The management committee accepted the opinions of the members and immediately changed the original planting method. The members said: This is what democratic cooperative management should be like! We are really satisfied with leaders like this in the cooperative.

**Thinking of the Members in Every Way**

When the spring production increase competition was just starting, some members were not very enthusiastic about production. The management committee visited the members separately and found that some members lacked food, so they were not motivated to produce. Niu Ensheng, the director of the cooperative, took the lead in lending 368 jin of grain, and the management committee members who were better off also took the lead in lending grain. Then, a meeting of Party and League members and members was convened to carry out mutual education on friendship. Under the leadership of the cadres, 48 households in the cooperative lent 4,000 jin of grain, plus the 2,700 jin of surplus seed grain lent by the cooperative, solving the difficulties of 33 households lacking grain. The members said: We share blessings and share difficulties. The cooperative cares about us so much, so we have to work harder to produce. The spring production campaign was carried out with great enthusiasm.

In the spring, the days are getting longer and the nights are getting shorter, and the members are suffering from staying up late for meetings every night. They criticized the management committee, saying: You speak and I add supplements at the general meeting, and we discuss until the third watch; the team records work points and arranges work every night, chattering until midnight. The management committee studied everyone's opinions and changed the meeting methods. The methods are: (1) The management committee should prepare well before the meeting, and the speaking time at the meeting should be short, allowing the members to discuss for most of the time. (2) Under normal circumstances, the general meeting of members should not be convened. When the general meeting of members is convened for major events such as distribution and summary evaluation, the discussion outline should be distributed to each production team in advance, and the management committee members should convey the information in different areas. If there is a lot of content to discuss, it should be discussed over several evenings. (3) When the management committee has a lot of content to discuss, a preparatory meeting should be held first, and the director of the cooperative and the members should connect individually, exchange opinions, and everyone should prepare to speak. (4) In order to reduce the trouble of recording work points in the production teams at night, work tickets should be issued according to the number of workdays used for contracted work and production. The members should be issued work tickets every day after finishing work, so that the "work site is clear." Use the rest time to plan the next day's work. The members should hand over the work tickets to the bookkeeper every three or five days, and the bookkeeper should record each person's workdays in the labor manual. The accountant should announce the work accounts to the members once a month. Since the spring change in meeting methods, meetings in the evening have generally started at 7:00 p.m. and ended at 9:00 p.m. for nearly a year, and only one summary and evaluation meeting exceeded 10:00 p.m. The cadres reflected: "Short meetings, more work." The members reflected: "Since the advanced cooperative was established, there has been less staying up late and running around." Everyone is very satisfied with this way of holding meetings.

During the autumn pre-distribution, because there was little millet planted in the cooperative, some pregnant female members reflected that the millet distributed this year was not enough for "confinement." The management committee listened to the opinions of the pregnant women and decided that anyone who gave birth to a child this year would receive an extra 30 jin of millet, which would be exchanged for other grains. A total of 37 households received extra millet. The pregnant women happily said: With rice for "confinement," we don't have to worry about anything else.

**Commending the Advanced and Promoting the Backward**

The cooperative conducted four summary evaluations and twelve short-term agricultural work quality inspections this year. Through agricultural work inspections and summary evaluations, criticism and self-criticism were carried out. For example, during the summer summary evaluation, member He Dianying criticized management committee member Fu Wenyu for weighing the wheat straw high for his own team and low for other teams. Fu Wenyu made a self-criticism to the members. The management committee adopted the principle of more commendation and less criticism, more reward and less punishment for the members. Over the past year, more than 90 people have been commended at the conference, including 24 people who have received material rewards. Among the five production brigades, three teams have won collective awards. Only two members in the cooperative have been punished for violating labor discipline and embezzling work points. After summarizing, evaluating, and commending advanced members, seven members in the cooperative who were known as "gluttonous and lazy" have become production activists.

**Cadres and the Masses are as Close as a Family**

With the implementation of democratic cooperative management, the cooperative has achieved a bumper harvest, and the members are as close as a family. When a member is sick, many members visit to inquire and help overcome difficulties. Party branch secretary He Dianfang has no children and feels depressed during the New Year, so the cooperative cadres and members go to comfort her and say some comforting words. Teams help each other and are closely united. Fu Wenhua's team has more wheat fields this year, and the site is not spacious; Li Wenbin's team hurried to finish threshing the wheat and lent all the site, livestock, and warehouse to Fu Wenhua's team. Zhou Dianchao's production team had not finished threshing the wheat field when it encountered a thunderstorm, and members from seven or eight teams drove livestock to help him thresh the field. Zhou Diangui's production team could not weed the soybean field due to weak labor, and Zhou Dianju's team automatically helped with 14 laborers, and weeded the soybeans in one go. Zhou Diangui said: "It is true that democratic unity is powerful, and we are not afraid of any difficulties in building socialism!"

    旗帜社是怎样实行民主办社的
    中共莒南县委员会
    山东省莒南县仕沟乡旗帜农业生产合作社，一年来由于社里的中共支部和管理委员会认真贯彻执行了民主办社的方针，社员生产劲头大，庄稼收成好。全社土地二千九百亩（丘陵地占60％以上），每亩平均粮食产量四百零二斤，比去年（与去年四十八户的老社产量相比）每亩增产十八斤。全社二百二十八户，增加收入和不增不减的二百一十七户，占全社总户数的95.2％，减收的只有十一户。
    从少数人包社到大家办社
    仕沟乡何家店村从1951年冬开始办社。在过去的几年里，支部和管理委员会不懂得实行民主办社，社务由少数干部“当家作主”，发号施令。管理委员会七个委员当中，当家主事的只有三人，其他委员是“听招呼”。这样办的结果是：“社干部逢事往外推，社员意见一大堆。”社主任钮恩升等几个主要干部认为自己是“公公背着儿媳妇走，受了累还不落好。”去年冬天，两个村（何家店、周家坡子）五个初级社并成一个高级社以后，党支部和管理委员会总结了过去办社不民主的教训，决定坚决执行民主办社的方针。当时管理委员庄子调等说：“社大，人多嘴杂，乱口主家不好办。”社主任钮恩升和党支部书记何佃芳等同志用过去办社不民主的教训说服了他们。管理委员会十三个委员为了表示他们实行民主办社的决心，每人写了一份保证书；在保证书上写着：（一）有事和大家商量，虚心听取群众意见；（二）大公无私，给社员当好勤务员；（三）和社员同患难，共呼吸；（四）加强团结，开展批评和自我批评，不骄傲，不自满。
    有事和社员商量
    到底怎样发扬民主？当初管理委员会还摸不着门路。如在订春季生产计划的时候，十三个管理委员集中在一起订了三天，计划还是没订好。管理委员会认为这样虽然浪费些工夫，总算作到了有事大家商量，不是少数人包办。社员们却说：
  “社干部误得起工，咱可给他们补不起工。”管理委员会听取群众意见，改变了这种作法。他们运用先召开老农座谈会和找生产队长、社员交谈等办法，广泛搜集社员意见；根据社员意见和国家要求，先由两三个主要干部负责订出计划草稿，然后提到支部委员会、管理委员会、党员大会，以生产队为单位的社员会，从内到外、从上到下逐级讨论修改；最后提交社员大会讨论修改。直到广大社员都满意了，才作为社员大会决议，交管理委员会贯彻执行。今年社内制定的九次全年、季度、小段的生产计划，三次预分和决分方案，都是这样作的。由于党支部和管理委员会有事和群众商量，听取群众意见，社员树立了当家作主思想，在领导工作上许多可能发生的错误都避免了。如在春季开展高额丰产竞赛运动中，社主任钮恩升按上级要求提出每亩产八百斤的增产指标，社员一致认为办不到，不同意，并批评钮恩升说：“你别做吹牛大汉。”管理委员会听取了社员的意见，仍然执行原包产每亩平均四百斤的计划。结果，今年实产每亩平均四百零二斤。夏种的时候，管理委员会计划用“旧犁带犁镜”的办法种豆子，社员们提出：地干，带犁镜种豆子苗出不齐，苗出不齐就要减产。管理委员会接受了社员的意见，立刻改变了原来的种植方法。社员们说：这才是民主办社的样子！社里有这样的领导人，咱真称心满意。
    处处为社员打算
    春季增产竞赛运动刚开展起来，有的社员生产劲头不大。管理委员分头访问社员，发现一部分社员缺粮食吃，所以生产不带劲。社主任钮恩升首先带头借出三百六十八斤粮食，生活较好的管理委员也都带头借出了粮食。接着召开了党、团员会和社员会，进行了友爱互相教育。在干部带头下，全社有四十八户社员借出粮食四千斤，加上社里借出的二千七百斤剩余的种子粮，解决了三十三户缺粮户的困难。社员们说：有福同享，有难同防，社里对咱这样关心，咱得加劲生产。春季生产热火朝天地开展起来了。
    春季日渐长夜渐短，社员苦于每晚开会熬眼。他们批评管理委员会说：开大会你说我补充，讨论讨论到三更；队里每晚先记工后排活，哇哇喳喳到半夜。管理委员会研究大家的意见，改变了开会方法，办法是：（一）管理委员会在会前作好准备，会上发言时间短，多数时间让社员讨论。（二）在一般情况下不召开社员大会，遇到分配、总结评比等大事召开社员大会的时候，事先把讨论提纲分发到各个生产小队，管理委员分片传达。如果讨论内容较多，就分几个晚间讨论。（三）管理委员会会议内容多的时候，先开预备会，社主任和委员个别串连，交换意见，每人都作发言准备。（四）为了减少各生产队晚间记工的麻烦，根据包工包产的农活用工数制发工票。社员每天作完活就发给工票，做到“地头清”。利用干活休息时间计划第二天的活路。社员每三天或五天把工票交给记账员，记账员把每人的工日记在劳动手册上。会计每月向社员公布一次工账。自从春季改变了开会办法，近一年来晚间开会一般都是七点开会，九点散会，只有一次总结评比大会超过了十点钟。干部反映：“会议短，办事多。”社员反映：“自从办了高级社，熬眼跑腿都不多。”大家对会议这样开法都非常满意。
    秋季预分的时候，因社内种谷子少，有些怀孕的女社员反映：今年分的谷子不够“坐月子”吃的。管理委员会听取了孕妇们的意见，决定凡在今年内生小孩的，每人多分谷子三十斤，用其他粮食顶换。全社有三十七户多分了谷子。孕妇高兴的说：有了米“坐月子”，别的东西就不愁了。
    表扬先进推动落后
    社里今年进行了四次总结评比，十二次小段农活质量检查。通过农活检查和总结评比，开展了批评和自我批评。如夏季进行总结评比的时候，社员何佃英批评管理委员傅文玉分麦秸给本队秤的高，给别队秤的低。傅文玉向社员作了检讨。管理委员会对社员采取了多表扬少批评、多奖励少处罚的原则。一年来社里有九十多人受到大会表扬，其中二十四人受到物质奖励。五个生产大队中，有三个队得了集体奖。全社只有两个社员因违反劳动纪律、贪污工分受到处罚。经过总结评比和表扬先进社员，社内有七个被称为“好吃懒作”的社员，变成了生产积极分子。
    干部群众亲如一家
    实行民主办社，社里获得了丰收，社员亲如一家。一个社员病了，有许多社员去问候，帮助克服困难。党支部书记何佃芳跟前没有小孩，逢年过节感到苦闷，社干部和社员就去安慰，说些解闷话。队和队互相帮助，亲密团结。傅文华小队今年麦田较多，场地不宽敞；李文宾小队抓紧把麦打完，把场地、牲口、仓库全部借给傅文华小队用。周佃超生产队麦场还没打完，遇上雷雨，七八个小队的社员赶着牲口去帮他打场。周佃贵生产小队因劳力弱，豆田锄不过来；周佃聚小队自动帮助十四个劳力，一气帮他锄完了豆子。周佃贵说：“真是民主团结力量大，建设社会主义的困难再大也不怕！”
