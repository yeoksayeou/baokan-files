Xinhua News Agency, December 15th, New York: The United Nations General Assembly, in its morning session on December 14th, discussed the recommendation of the General Committee to include the issue of the United States' interference in the internal affairs of People's Democratic countries and its subversive activities against them on the agenda of the meeting. The General Committee passed on the 13th the inclusion of this issue on the agenda and referred it to the Special Political Committee for discussion.

The General Assembly, by a vote of 50 to 2 (the Kuomintang elements and the Dominican Republic opposed), passed the inclusion of this item on the agenda. At the same time, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and other countries, the Assembly, at the insistence of the United States, decided by a vote of 47 to 8, with 14 abstentions, to refer this item to the Special Political Committee for discussion first. This action by the United States was to delay the discussion of this issue until the final stages of the meeting.

Kuznetsov, the head of the Soviet delegation, said in his speech during the discussion that the Soviet delegation could not agree with the General Committee's recommendation to refer this issue to the Special Political Committee for review first. He said that such a delay was obviously wrong, because this was a very urgent issue, and the correct resolution of this issue would be of great significance for international good-neighborly relations and the establishment of trust, for easing international tensions and strengthening peace, and for expanding international cooperation in accordance with the United Nations Charter.

The Assembly then discussed the issue of amending the Charter to increase the number of non-permanent members of the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council.

Twenty countries, including Latin American countries and Spain, submitted a proposal to the Assembly, advocating increasing the six non-permanent members of the Security Council to eight.

Representatives of El Salvador, Venezuela, Spain, Sudan, Jordan, Mexico, and Ceylon spoke in support of the proposal to increase the number of representatives of the aforementioned bodies.

They said that due to the expansion of the United Nations, the membership of the main bodies of this organization should also be increased accordingly. They believed that such an increase was necessary to enable various geographical regions to obtain fair and full representation in the important bodies of the United Nations.

David, the head of the Czechoslovak delegation, believed that the arguments of the above proposal were worthy of serious attention.

He said that the Czechoslovak delegation fully understood the desire of certain geographical regions to obtain proportional representation, especially Asian countries, which should obtain representation commensurate with their population and international significance. However, increasing the number of members of the main bodies of the United Nations is only one step in solving the problem of the membership of the main bodies, and the specific implementation of this measure is equally important. The fair distribution of seats in the United Nations bodies, especially the Security Council, according to geographical regions is of great significance, because this can ensure that the members of this body, which bears the primary responsibility for maintaining universal peace and security, are proportionate and ensure the genuine representation of the body.

Then, David condemned the United States for undermining the provisions of the Charter regarding the equitable distribution of seats according to geographical region principles, as well as the London Gentlemen's Agreement, and forcibly giving the seat of Eastern European countries in the Security Council to the Philippines. He said that this contained serious consequences and would weaken the trust between the member states of the United Nations.

David said that the twenty-nation proposal on expanding the main bodies of the United Nations did not contain anything that could guarantee that the principle of equitable distribution of representation according to geographical regions would be fully guaranteed. Based on the experience of the past few years, the Czechoslovak delegation cannot support the proposal to increase the number of Security Council members until it receives a written guarantee that the principle of equitable distribution of Security Council seats according to geographical regions will not be undermined again in the future.

The next meeting of the General Assembly is scheduled for December 17th.

### 苏联代表在联合国大会发言  反对拖延讨论美国颠复活动案  捷代表谴责美国破坏按地理区域分配安理会代表

    苏联代表在联合国大会发言
    反对拖延讨论美国颠复活动案
    捷代表谴责美国破坏按地理区域分配安理会代表
    据新华社15日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会12月14日上午会议根据总务委员会的建议，讨论把苏联代表团提出的关于美国干涉人民民主国家内政和对它们进行颠复活动的问题列入会议议程的建议。总务委员会在13日通过了把这个问题列入会议议程，并把它交给特别政治委员会讨论。
    大会以五十票对两票（国民党分子和多米尼加共和国反对）的表决结果，通过把这个项目列入议程。同时，大会又不顾苏联等国家的反对，在美国坚持下，以四十七票对八票和十四票弃权的表决结果，决定把这个项目先交给特别政治委员会讨论。美国这一行动是要把对这个问题的讨论拖到会议的最后阶段。
    苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫在讨论时发言说，苏联代表团不能同意总务委员会决定的先把这个问题交给特别政治委员会审查的建议。他说这种拖延显然是不对的，因为这是一个很迫切的问题，这个问题的正确解决，对国际睦邻关系和信任的建立，对缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平，对根据联合国宪章扩大国际合作都有重要的意义。
    大会接着讨论了关于修改宪章以增加安全理事会和经济及社会理事会的非常任理事国的问题。
    拉丁美洲国家和西班牙等二十个国家向大会提出一项提案，主张把安全理事会中的六个非常任理事国增加到八个。
    萨尔瓦多、委内瑞拉、西班牙、苏丹、约旦、墨西哥和锡兰的代表发言支持关于增加上述机构代表名额的提议。
    他们说，由于联合国的扩大，这个组织的主要机构的成员也要作相应的增加。他们认为，这种增加是为了使各个地理区域能够在联合国重要机构中得到公正和充分的代表权所必需的。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长戴维认为上述提案的论据是值得认真注意的。
    他说，捷克斯洛伐克代表团非常理解某些地理区域希望自己能得到合乎比例的代表权的要求，这首先是指亚洲国家，它们应该得到符合它们的人口和国际意义的代表权。但是，联合国主要机构成员数目的增加只是解决主要机构成员问题的一个步骤，这种措施的具体执行也是同样重要的。联合国机构，首先是安理会的代表名额按照地理区域公平分配有很重要的意义，因为这能保证这个对维护普遍和平和安全负有主要责任的机构的成员合乎比例，保证该机构真正的代表性。
    接着，戴维谴责美国破坏宪章中规定的关于按地理区域原则平均分配代表名额的条款以及伦敦君子协定，强把东欧国家在安理会的席位给了菲律宾。他说，这包含有严重的后果，会使联合国会员国之间的信任削弱。
    戴维说，二十国关于扩大联合国主要机构的提案没有任何东西能够保证按地理区域公正分配代表权的原则会得到充分保障。捷克斯洛伐克代表团根据过去几年的经验，在对将来会不会再发生破坏按地理区域公平分配安理会代表名额的原则这一点没有得到书面保证以前，不能支持关于增加安理会理事国的提案。
    大会下次会议定在12月17日举行。
