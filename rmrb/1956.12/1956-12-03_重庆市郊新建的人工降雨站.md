In this way, it can be increased from three crops a year in the past to five crops a year, and vegetable production can be increased by 30% to 40%.

　　重庆市郊新建的人工降雨站
    重庆市郊第一个人工降雨站——九龙坡区光明人工降雨站已经正式开始放水。有了这个人工降雨站以后，光明蔬菜生产合作社的三百三十六亩砂地的蔬菜，什么时候需要水，什么时候在它们上面就可以“下雨”。这样，能由过去一年种三季增加到一年种五季，蔬菜产量可以增加30％到40％。人们正在欢喜地观看降雨器喷水洒浇蔬菜。
