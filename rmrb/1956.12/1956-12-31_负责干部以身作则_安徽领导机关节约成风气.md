Hefei Dispatch: The Party and government leadership organs in Anhui Province are making thrift a conscious movement.

On the day after the spirit of the Second Plenary Session was conveyed, several secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat personally began merging their offices. Originally, they and their secretaries each occupied an office, but now they have combined them into one office. The Secretary-General and Director of the General Office have also merged their offices. Responsible comrades who originally had separate offices in both the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have also implemented mergers. Under the leadership of responsible comrades, the various departments and offices of the Provincial Party Committee and the units under the Provincial People's Committee have freed up many houses. Comrades who had been living outside for a long time have now moved into the agency dormitory, which not only saves expenses but also brings many conveniences to life.

The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee organs have also saved a large amount of grain. The Provincial Party Committee organ canteen alone has saved more than 20,000 jin of grain since advocating thrift, and many staff members have voluntarily returned their surplus grain coupons each month. After the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee organs implemented thrift measures, they reduced capital construction costs and procurement costs by hundreds of thousands of yuan. The use of cars by the leading organs of the Party and government in Anhui Province has also been greatly reduced. Responsible comrades generally do not take cars unless absolutely necessary. Because of the lead of the provincial leadership organs, no cars can be seen in front of theaters and cinemas now. Many ministers and directors go to work or meetings on foot or by bus.

    负责干部以身作则
    安徽领导机关节约成风气
    本报合肥30日电　安徽省党、政领导机关节约成为自觉性的运动。
    在传达二中全会精神以后的第二天，省委书记处的几位书记就亲自动手归并自己的办公室，原来他们和秘书各占一间办公室，现在都并到一个办公室。办公厅的秘书长和主任也合并了办公室。原在省委和省人民委员会两面都设有单独办公室的负责同志，也实行了归并。在负责同志带动下，省委各部、处和省人民委员会所属各单位腾出了许多房子。原来长期住在外边的同志，现在也搬进了机关宿舍，这样，不仅节约了开支，并给生活上带来很多方便。
    省委和省人民委员会机关还节约了大量粮食，只是省委机关食堂，提倡节约以后就节约二万多斤粮食，许多工作人员都主动地把每月多余的粮票交了回去。省委和省人民委员会机关在节约后，削减基本建设费及购置费达数十万元。安徽省党、政领导机关的汽车使用现在也已大大节约。负责同志非属十分必要，一般都不乘坐小汽车。因为省的领导机关的带动，现在在戏院、电影院门前看不到小汽车了。许多部长、厅长上班或开会时，都以步代车，或坐公共汽车。
