Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 13th: Representatives of workers from seven industrial enterprises in Budapest's 20th district visited the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government at noon on December 11th and presented their opinions and hopes regarding the domestic situation to the government.

Prime Minister Kadar met with the worker representatives and spoke with them.

Worker Representatives' Remarks

The workers expressed their support for the government's measures in their remarks. They emphasized that every honest worker welcomes the government's recent measures. At the same time, they requested that the deadline for surrendering weapons not be changed repeatedly, so as to avoid repeating the serious mistakes of the Imre Nagy government. The worker representatives said that honest people are willing to work because they know that strikes cause infinite harm to the working people. They emphasized that financial measures should be taken so that only those who work can receive wages. The workers emphasized that the government should adopt a resolute and tough attitude towards all those who engage in activities against the interests of the people. The government can get the support of the working people in all these measures. The workers also said that they want to restore multiple shifts and are waiting for the government to take measures to strengthen public security.

Some workers said that the people are waiting for the government to publish its detailed program as soon as possible. They also requested that the government appoint government commissioners to lead the factories and stop some irresponsible people in the factories from wasting the factory's property at will.

Prime Minister Kadar's Remarks

During the conversation, Kadar, Prime Minister of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, answered many questions and opinions raised by the workers.

The mass base of the counter-revolutionary forces has gradually disintegrated, the revolutionary forces are growing, and the organizational work of the Party is being carried out throughout the country.

Kadar specifically pointed out that in recent days, the mass base on which the counter-revolutionary forces rely has gradually disintegrated, because more and more people who have seen the danger of counter-revolution are rising up against the counter-revolutionary forces. They condemn disorder and the threat to order and public security.

Kadar said that the counter-revolutionary forces are now weaker for another reason, which is the growth of the revolutionary forces. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, a powerful organization, has strengthened its activities. After November 4th, one of the demands of the counter-revolutionaries was not to establish Party organizations in enterprises. However, Party organizational work is now being carried out throughout the country. Kadar emphasized that all honest people, regardless of their political beliefs, should jointly oppose those counter-revolutionary elements who make it sound as if they are speaking in the name of the workers. This is not just a matter for the Party, it is also a matter for the workers and all our people.

Kadar said: On December 6th, when the worker masses appeared on the streets holding aloft the tricolor flag and the red flag, it caused fear and anxiety among the counter-revolutionary elements. He said: The strengthening of the guards is the same. Now, the masses have confidence in the Hungarian guards because they see that these guards are determined and have sufficient strength to maintain order and tranquility.

Regional workers' councils are tools in the hands of counter-revolutionary elements, and they are entirely engaged in counter-revolutionary activities.

Kadar said: The development of the situation confirms that the offensive of the revolutionary forces is correct and that the political struggle should be strengthened to make the masses despise the counter-revolution.

Kadar continued, people are increasingly aware that it is impossible to restore normal life in the way that counter-revolutionaries instigate. The people have understood that in order to restore normal life, it is absolutely necessary to create a foundation, and this foundation can in no way be strikes, mutual killing and turbulence.

People know that it is impossible to move forward if no one works, no one earns money, and only consumes existing stores.

When Kadar spoke of the rumors spread by the reactionary forces about disbanding factory worker councils, he said that the government firmly opposes the establishment of regional worker councils. He pointed out that these councils are tools in the hands of counter-revolutionary elements. Kadar said that as for the worker councils in factories, they are grassroots organizations of people's democracy through which the working people can directly participate in solving the problems of their factories. These committees should be dedicated to the task of economic leadership.

Kadar said that in the worker councils, there are some people who have nothing in common with the working class. These people are not even workers. They may have only worked in the factory for a year or two. Before that, they were factory owners, officers, fascists, "Arrow Cross" members, or released criminals. In political terms, they have nothing in common with the working class. It is these people who are trying to disrupt the normal work of enterprises.

Kadar said that organizations such as the Budapest Central Workers' Council and other regional workers' councils are entirely engaged in counter-revolutionary political activities; the counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated these councils are primarily interested in counter-revolutionary political activities. Kadar said: The government has banned the activities of such institutions because they attack the achievements of the revolution and the interests of the working class.

Kadar emphasized: It only takes eight days of strikes to affect the improvement of the standard of living for a year. He then pointed out that some workers waste the wealth of the factory at will, thereby causing great losses to the working class. He believes that the worker masses have the right to demand that the worker council report on its work.

Kadar then talked about the particularly difficult problem of coal supply. He pointed out: If the work in the coal mines does not return to normal, tens of thousands of workers will soon be unable to work due to lack of coal and power.

Kadar assured the workers that the government will fully implement the measures it has taken and will not let go of the counter-revolutionary elements.

The government's primary task is to restore legal order, and now the revolutionary forces have the overwhelming advantage.

Regarding the question of the government's detailed program, Kadar explained to the worker representatives: The government's primary task is to restore legal order. To eliminate the counter-revolution, a revolutionary offensive is needed. Kadar told the workers: I think that by the end of next week, we can put forward our solutions on a series of important issues.

Regarding the issue of other political parties, Kadar pointed out that this issue should be resolved, so that every honest person who hopes to build socialism can participate in political activities. Our intention is to solve this problem on the premise of conforming to the interests of the people and the working class. As for various freedoms, we are prepared to give everyone various freedoms, but it has a limit, which is that we will not allow these freedoms to affect the people's power. We support the development of democracy. We want socialism, the people's power, and various freedoms within this scope.

Kadar finally said: Now the revolutionary political forces overwhelmingly outnumber the counter-revolutionary forces.

    卡达尔总理同布达佩斯工人代表谈话
    匈牙利需要一个革命的攻势
    工人代表拥护政府措施要求对破坏分子采取强硬态度
    新华社布达佩斯13日电　布达佩斯第二十区七个工业企业的工人代表在12月11日中午访问了匈牙利工农革命政府，并且就国内情况向政府申述了自己的意见和希望。
    卡达尔总理接见了工人代表们，并且同他们谈了话。
    工人代表的谈话
    工人们在谈话中表示拥护政府的措施。他们强调指出，每一个正直的劳动者都欢迎政府最近采取的措施。他们同时要求无论如何不要多次改变交出武器的限期，而重犯伊姆雷·纳吉政府的重大错误。工人代表们说：正直的人愿意工作，因为他们知道罢工对于劳动人民造成了无限损害。他们强调应该采取财政措施，使得只有工作的人才能得到工资。工人们强调指出：政府对于所有那些进行反对人民利益的活动的人，应抱坚决和强硬的态度。在这一切措施上，政府都可以得到劳动人民的支持。工人们又说，他们想恢复多班工作制，并且等待政府采取关于加强公共治安的措施。
    有几个工人说：人民已经在等待政府尽快地公布它的详细的纲领。他们同时要求政府委派一些政府委员来领导工厂，制止工厂里一些不负责任的人随便浪费工厂的财产。
    卡达尔总理的谈话
    在谈话过程中，工农革命政府总理卡达尔回答了工人们提出的许多问题和意见。
    反革命势力的群众基础已逐步瓦解，革命力量日益成长，党的组织工作正在全国各地进行。
    卡达尔特别提出：最近几天，反革命势力所依赖的群众基础已经在逐步瓦解，因为看清了反革命的危险的人正在日益增多，起来反对反革命势力的人也日益增多。他们谴责紊乱、谴责对于秩序和公共治安的威胁。
    卡达尔说，反革命势力现在更加削弱，还有另外一个原因，这就是革命力量的生长。匈牙利社会主义工人党这个有力的组织加强了活动。在11月4日以后，反革命的要求之一是不要在企业中建立党的组织。但是，党的组织工作现在正在全国各地进行。卡达尔强调指出：一切正直的人，不管他们的政治信仰如何，都应该共同反对那些反革命分子把事情说得好像他们在用工人的名义讲话。这不仅仅是党的事情，这也是工人们和我们全体人民的事情。
    卡达尔说：12月6日，当工人群众高举三色旗和红旗出现在街头的时候，引起了反革命分子的恐惧和不安。他说：警卫队的加强也是一样的。现在，群众对匈牙利警卫队是有信心的，因为它们看到这些警卫队坚决地并且有足够力量来维护秩序和安宁。
    地区性的工人委员会是掌握在反革命分子手中的工具，它们完全是从事反革命活动的。
    卡达尔说：事态的发展证实了革命力量的进攻是正确的，应该加强政治斗争，使群众鄙视反革命。
    卡达尔继续说，人们愈来愈认识到，按照反革命分子所教唆的方法，不可能恢复正常的生活。老百姓已经懂得，要想恢复正常的生活，绝对需要创造一个基础，而这个基础无论如何也不能是罢工、互相残杀和动荡不安。
    人们知道，任何人都不工作、不挣钱、而只消耗现有的储存，这种情况不可能是前进的基础。
    卡达尔在谈到反动势力所散布的解散工厂工人委员会的谣言的时候说，政府坚决反对的是成立地区性的工人委员会。他指出，这种委员会是掌握在反革命分子手中的工具。卡达尔说，至于工厂中的工人委员会，它是人民民主的基层组织，劳动人民通过它就能够直接参加解决他们工厂的问题。这些委员会应当专门从事经济领导的任务。
    卡达尔说，在工人委员会中，有些人同工人阶级毫无任何共同之处。这些人甚至不是工人。他们在工厂中工作可能只有一两年。而在这以前，他们是工厂主、军官、法西斯分子、“箭十字”分子或者是被释放的罪犯。他们在政治方面，同工人阶级并没有任何共同之处。正是这些人尽力破坏企业中的正常工作。
    卡达尔说，像布达佩斯中央工人委员会和其他区域性工人委员会等这样一些组织，完全是从事反革命政治活动的；渗入到这些委员会
  中的反革命分子主要感兴趣的就是反革命政治活动。卡达尔说：政府禁止了这样一些机构的活动，因为它们攻击革命的成就，攻击工人阶级的利益。
    卡达尔强调指出：只需要罢工八天，就可以影响一年的生活水平的提高。他随后指出，某些工人随意浪费工厂的财富，从而给工人阶级带来重大的损失。他认为工人群众有权要求工人委员会报告工作。
    卡达尔随后谈到情况特别困难的煤的供应问题。他指出：煤矿的工作如果不恢复正常，很快就会有上万的工人因缺乏煤和动力而无法工作。
    卡达尔向工人保证，政府将完全执行已采取的措施，并且不会放过反革命分子。
    政府首要的任务是恢复合法秩序，现在革命力量已占压倒的优势。
    关于政府的详细纲领问题，卡达尔向工人代表解释说：政府首要的任务就是恢复合法的秩序。要消灭反革命，就需要一个革命的攻势。卡达尔向工人们说：我想在下周末，我们在一系列重要问题方面，可以提出我们的解决办法。
    关于其它政党问题，卡达尔指出，这个问题应该解决，要使每个希望建立社会主义的正直的人都可以参加政治活动。我们的意图是在符合人民和工人阶级利益的前提下来解决这个问题。至于各种自由，我们准备给予各人以各种自由，但它有一个限度就是我们不允许这些自由影响到人民政权。我们支持民主的发展。我们要社会主义、人民政权和在这个范围内的各种自由。
    卡达尔最后说：现在革命的政治力量以压倒的优势超过了反革命力量。
