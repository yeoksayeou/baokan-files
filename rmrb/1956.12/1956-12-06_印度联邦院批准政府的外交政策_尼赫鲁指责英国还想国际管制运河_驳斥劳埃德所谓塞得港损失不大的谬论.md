Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 5th: The Indian Council of States concluded its two-day debate on foreign policy yesterday evening, passing a motion proposed by Prime Minister Nehru and approving the Indian government's foreign policy.

Nehru, in concluding the debate, addressed the statement made by the British Foreign Secretary in the British House of Commons on December 3rd regarding the withdrawal of troops from Egypt. He said, "Insofar as Lloyd's statement says that British and French troops will withdraw quickly—although no date is given—," he welcomed the statement. However, he was disturbed by many other parts of Lloyd's statement.

The Indian Prime Minister criticized Lloyd for reiterating the British government's position in the negotiations on the Suez Canal issue to "insist on their views expressed at the Security Council when the eighteen-nation proposal was adopted on October 13th." Nehru said: "Now this is the most surprising thing. The eighteen-nation proposal is completely invalid, and it seems very surprising to talk about or return to suggestions that were made and rejected before the war occurred. In fact, due to this turmoil and war, the entire background of the situation in the Middle East has changed."

Nehru criticized Lloyd's words about the role of the United Nations Emergency Force. Lloyd said that during negotiations, the presence of an international force in the canal area would be of "the utmost help."

Nehru said that, as far as India was concerned, the force was not there to "continue the actions of the British and French troops." He said: "We are there because Egypt agreed to it. We are there to generally maintain the ceasefire line."

Nehru said that problems such as the operation of the canal could only be addressed after foreign troops withdrew from Egypt. He said: "Until this primary issue is finally resolved not with empty words but with actual withdrawal actions, we cannot effectively discuss or deal with other issues at all."

Nehru said: "Perhaps Lloyd must justify what has happened. His tone seems to suggest that, due to the actions taken by Britain and France, they have brought great benefits to mankind. I regret to say that these erroneous views still dominate their minds."

Nehru also expressed his disagreement with Lloyd's statement that British and French troops had carefully reduced casualties and destruction. He said: "Last night I saw many photos of Port Said, which deeply impressed me with the horrors of war. The essence of Port Said has been turned into ruins." He pointed out that the losses suffered by Port Said, whether in terms of human life or material, were "very large."

Referring to the Pakistan issue, Nehru reiterated his suggestion made four or five years ago about issuing a non-aggression declaration with Pakistan. He said that this suggestion was still valid.

Referring to the Hungarian issue, Nehru expressed regret that the Hungarian government had not agreed to allow United Nations observers to enter Hungary. He said that the Hungarian issue and the Egyptian issue were different in nature, although they were both bad. He accused the United Nations of attempting to "almost suppress the Egyptian issue and set it aside, replacing it with the Hungarian issue."

Referring to his upcoming visit to the United States, Nehru said that he believed that benefits could be gained from this visit.

During the Council of States' debate on foreign policy, Gupta, the leader of the Communist Party of India's parliamentary group, had called for joint action by the Bandung Conference countries to ensure the withdrawal of British and French forces from Egypt.

### 印度联邦院批准政府的外交政策  尼赫鲁指责英国还想国际管制运河  驳斥劳埃德所谓塞得港损失不大的谬论

    印度联邦院批准政府的外交政策
    尼赫鲁指责英国还想国际管制运河
    驳斥劳埃德所谓塞得港损失不大的谬论
    据新华社新德里5日电　印度联邦院昨天晚上结束了历时两天的外交政策辩论，通过了尼赫鲁总理提出的动议，并且批准了印度政府的外交政策。
    尼赫鲁在结束辩论的时候谈到了英国外交大臣3日在英国下院宣布的关于从埃及撤军问题的声明。他说，“就劳埃德声明中所说的英法军队将迅速撤退——虽然没有提出日期——而言”，他是欢迎这项声明的。但是，他因为劳埃德声明中的其他许多部分而感到不安。
    印度总理批评劳埃德重提英国政府在关于苏伊士运河问题的谈判中，要“坚持他们在安全理事会10月13日通过关于十八国提案时所表示的意见”。尼赫鲁说：“现在这是最令人吃惊的话。十八国提案已经全然无效了，谈论或者回到在战事发生前作出的和被拒绝了的建议上去，看来是很令人吃惊的。事实上，由于这次动乱和战事，中东局势的整个背景已经起了变化。”
    尼赫鲁批评劳埃德关于联合国紧急部队的作用的话。劳埃德说，在谈判期间，一支国际部队驻在运河地区将起“最大不过的帮助”作用。
    尼赫鲁说，就印度来说，这支部队到那里去并不是为了“继续英法军队的行动”。他说：“我们到那里去是因为埃及同意我们这样做。我们到那里去是要大体上保持在停火线上。”
    尼赫鲁说，只有在外国军队从埃及撤出之后，才能处理像运河经营这类的问题。他说：“在这个首要问题不是用空话而是用实际的撤退行动来作最后解决之前，我们根本不能有效地讨论或处理其他问题。
    尼赫鲁说：“也许劳埃德必须证明所发生的一切是有正当理由的。他的语气好像是说，由于英法所采取的行动，他们已经为人类带来了巨大的利益。我遗憾地说，这些错误的观点仍然支配着他们的头脑。”
    尼赫鲁也表示不能同意劳埃德所说的英法军队曾经小心翼翼地减少死伤人数和破坏。他说：“昨晚我看到许多关于塞得港的照片，这些照片使我对战争恐怖有深刻的印象，塞得港的精华部分都成了废墟。”他指出，无论是人的生命方面或物质方面，塞得港所受的损失都是“非常大的”。
    尼赫鲁在谈到巴基斯坦问题的时候，重申他在四、五年前提出的关于同巴基斯坦发表非战宣言的建议。他说，这个建议仍然有效。
    在谈到匈牙利问题的时候，尼赫鲁对于匈牙利政府不同意联合国观察员进入匈牙利表示遗憾。他说，匈牙利问题和埃及问题在本质上是不同的，虽然它们同样是不好的。他指责在联合国中曾经有过“差不多压下埃及问题、并且把它搁置一旁而代之以匈牙利问题”的企图。
    尼赫鲁在谈到即将访问美国一事说，他相信可以从这次访问得到益处。
    在联邦院进行外交政策辩论的时候，印度共产党议会党团领袖古普塔曾经要求万隆会议国家共同采取行动以使英法部队撤离埃及。
