This note requested the West German government to take necessary measures to find the three thousand and thirteen Soviet citizens previously listed by the Soviet Embassy to the West German Foreign Ministry, to ascertain the whereabouts of the four thousand and forty-three displaced Soviet citizens listed in the second batch of names attached to this note by the Soviet Embassy, and to assist them in returning to their homeland.

The Soviet government's note stated: The vast majority of the aforementioned Soviet citizens were forcibly driven to Germany by the Hitlerite elements to perform forced labor, but the West German Foreign Ministry has stubbornly insisted that these people are "political refugees."

    苏联照会西德政府
    要求遣返七千多苏联公民
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社波恩13日讯：苏联驻波恩大使馆参赞库德里雅夫采夫在12日把苏联大使馆关于要求遣返住在西德的苏联公民问题的一份新照会交给了西德外交部。这份照会要求西德政府采取必要措施来寻找苏联大使馆以前向西德外交部开列的三千零一十三名苏联公民，查明苏联大使馆在这次照会中附送的第二批名单中开列的四千零四十三名被迁徙的苏联公民的下落，并且协助他们返回祖国。
    苏联政府的照会说：上述的苏联公民绝大多数都是被希特勒分子强行驱往德国作强迫劳动的，而西德外交部竟然硬说这些人是“政治难民”。
