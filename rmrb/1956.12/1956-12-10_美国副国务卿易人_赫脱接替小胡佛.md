Xinhua News Agency, Augusta, Georgia, 9th: U.S. President Eisenhower announced on the 8th that Herbert Hoover Jr. had resigned as Under Secretary of State, and appointed former Governor of Massachusetts Christian A. Herter as Under Secretary of State.

As early as August, during the U.S. Republican Party convention, American newspapers were saying that Herter received the promise of the Under Secretary of State position as a reward for agreeing to refuse to compete with Nixon for the Republican Party's vice-presidential nomination.

　　美国副国务卿易人
　　赫脱接替小胡佛
    据新华社9日讯　佐治亚州奥古斯大消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔8日宣布小赫伯特·胡佛辞去副国务卿职务，并且任命前马萨诺塞州州长克里斯钦·阿·赫脱为副国务卿。
    早在今年8月美国共和党开代表大会的时候，美国的报纸就在说：由于赫脱答应拒绝同尼克松抢夺共和党副总统候选人的职位，他得到了副国务卿职位的预诺，作为一种报酬。
