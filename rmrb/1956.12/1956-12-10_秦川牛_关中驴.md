　　Qinchuan Cattle and Guanzhong Donkeys
　　Bì Fū

    The Guanzhong Plain in Shaanxi Province produces the nationally famous "Qinchuan Cattle" and "Guanzhong Donkeys." From last year to July this year, a total of 988 head of cattle and donkeys were transported from Shaanxi to Northeast China, Gansu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Sichuan and other places for breeding purposes. Guanzhong donkeys are also exported to foreign countries as breeding stock. At present, the Animal Husbandry Bureau of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture has also begun to investigate and study relevant information on these two kinds of draft animals in order to plan breeding and further improve the quality of breeds.

    Qinchuan cattle are one of the best breeds of yellow cattle in China. They have a purplish-red and lustrous coat, bell-shaped eyes, short horns, wide front and rear hips, and cloven hooves. They look like a tiger's head and a lion's body, majestic and beautiful. This kind of cattle has a stout body, is very strong, has tight hooves, can walk long distances, can work for a long time, and has a docile temperament. Women and children can also pull and drive them. Qinchuan cattle are generally three feet five or six inches tall, and some are as tall as four feet five inches. According to the general farming requirements of Guanzhong, each head of cattle can handle thirty mu of dry land or twenty mu of paddy field, and the working time in a year is roughly seven to eight months. When transporting on flat ground with iron-wheeled carts, one head of cattle can pull 1,000 to 1,500 jin of goods, traveling 60 to 80 li per day. Qinchuan cattle are a very popular draft animal among local farmers, who praise it as the "Eight-Point Bull" — mouth like a shengzi (square and large, willing to eat grass), eyes like a zhongzi (open, round and bright), ears like a fan (straight and energetic), horns like a hammer (fine and solid), body like a tunzi (stout), hooves like a beizi (hooves tight and strong), tail like a shuaizi (long tailbone, lots of tail hair), legs like pillars (straight and strong). These eight points are the conditions for selecting good cattle.

    Guanzhong donkeys are also one of the best large donkeys in the country. They are generally about four feet five inches tall, with a black and oily coat, a pinkish-white nose, bright eyes, and a white belly. The combination of several colors is particularly beautiful. Some also have gray, rabbit-brown, and chrysanthemum-green coats. This kind of donkey has a straight head, long ears, stout pasterns, short and coarse mane, vertical limbs, thick and solid hooves, and is very strong. In the Guanzhong area, one donkey can handle the work of twenty mu of dry land or fifteen mu of paddy field. When transporting on flat ground with iron-wheeled carts, one donkey can pull 500 to 1,000 jin of goods, traveling 60 to 70 li per day. Guanzhong donkeys are also very good at carrying loads. They can generally carry 150 to 200 jin of goods (some good male donkeys can carry 300 jin), and can travel 80 to 90 li per day. In mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation, farmers prefer this kind of donkey.

　　秦川牛　关中驴
　　毕夫
    陕西省关中平原地方，出产全国有名的“秦川牛”和“关中驴”。从去年到今年7月，由陕西运往东北和甘肃，浙江、广东、四川等地作种畜用的牛和驴共有九百八十八头。关中驴还运到外国去作种畜。现在，陕西省农业厅畜牧局也开始调查研究有关这两种耕畜的资料，以便有计划的繁殖培育，进一步提高品种质量。
    秦川牛是我国黄牛类中最好的品种之一。它毛色紫红而光润，铃眼短角，前后胯宽大，四蹄两行，看起来虎头狮身，威武美观。这种牛体型粗壮，很有力，蹄瓣紧密，耐走长路，做活持久，性情温和，妇孺也能牵引驱使。秦川牛一般有三尺五、六寸高，还有高到四尺五寸的。按照关中一般耕作要求较细的情况，每头牛能负担三十亩旱地或二十亩水地，一年做活时间大致有七个月到八个月。在平地上用铁轮车运输，一头牛可拉一千到一千五百斤重的东西，日行六十到八十里路。秦川牛是当地农民很喜爱的耕畜，大家夸它是“八子牛”——嘴如升子（又方又大，肯吃草），眼如盅子（睁起来圆大有神），耳如扇子（端直有精神），角如锤子（质细、坚实），身如囤子（粗壮），蹄如杯子（蹄瓣紧密结实），尾如甩子
  （尾骨长，尾毛多），腿如柱子
  （端直有力）。这八样，正是挑选好牛的条件。
    关中驴，在全国大型驴中也是最好的一种。一般高四尺五寸左右，毛色黑油油的，粉白鼻子，亮眼睛，白肚皮，几种颜色配合起来，分外好看。也有的毛呈灰色、兔褐色和菊花青色的。这种驴头直，耳长，管围粗壮，鬃毛粗短，四肢垂直，骨胳粗大，蹄墩厚坚实，很有力气。在关中地方，一头驴能负担二十亩旱地或十五亩水地的活路。在平地上用铁轮车运输，一头驴能拉五百斤到一千斤重的东西，日行六，七十里。关中驴的驮力也很好，一般可以驮一百五十到二百斤重的东西（有的好公驴能驮重三百斤），每天能走八、九十里。在交通不便的山区里，农民更喜爱这种驴。
