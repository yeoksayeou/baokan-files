　　A Thriving Scene in the Rural Areas of the Dabie Mountains
    The old revolutionary base area, the Dabie Mountains, has presented a thriving scene since the realization of agricultural cooperation. The Meishan Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, already has 682 cattle and is continuously increasing that number. In summer and autumn, the cattle are grazed on the mountains by designated personnel. This is a picture of the cooperative members driving the cattle down the mountain to be dispersed to various villages for winter feeding. Photo by Cheng Jiakai (Xinhua News Agency Draft)

　　大别山区农村一片兴旺景象
    老革命根据地大别山区，在实现农业合作化以后，出现了一片兴旺景象。安徽省金寨县梅山农林牧业生产合作社喂养的牛已经有六百八十二头，还在不断增加。夏天秋天，牛群由专人在山上放牧。这是社员在赶着牛群下山，分散到各村饲养过冬。　　程嘉楷摄（新华社稿）
