Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: A grand memorial meeting for world cultural figures, American scientist Benjamin Franklin, French scientist Pierre Curie and his wife, Polish scientist Marie Curie, was held in Beijing tonight.

Helene Langevin (previously misreported as Lang Yunwan), granddaughter of Pierre and Marie Curie, and her husband, French nuclear physicist Michel Langevin, Polish physicists Złotowski and Teske, and American writer Alvah Bessie, attended the memorial meeting at the invitation of the Chinese Committee for the Commemoration of World Cultural Figures, 1956.

The Chinese Committee for the Commemoration of World Cultural Figures, 1956, also invited many American scientists to attend the conference, and received letters from fifteen American scientists. They thanked the committee for the invitation, and explained that they were unable to come to China to attend the conference in person because they could not obtain passports from the United States government. W.E.B. Du Bois, member of the World Peace Council, American historian and writer, Linus Pauling, Vice-President of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, American chemist, and Jordan, Chairman of the American Benjamin Franklin Bicentennial Celebration, all sent letters to the conference to express their congratulations.

Guo Moruo, Chairman of the conference, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, and President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening speech (see page 7).

Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and physicist, gave a report on "Franklin's Life and His Contributions to Science". Physicist Qian Sanqiang introduced "The Life of the Curies". Złotowski delivered a speech on behalf of the Polish Academy of Sciences, conveying the congratulations of Polish scientists to the conference. He said: Standing at the threshold of the new atomic age, we understand the importance of international scientific cooperation more than ever. The more science develops, the more mutual understanding and justice in the world are needed. The greatest responsibility of scientists is to do their best to ensure that the world's great scientific heritage is never misused for destructive purposes.

Helene Langevin spoke on behalf of herself and her husband, Michel Langevin. She said that they were very excited to participate in this conference. She introduced the history and significance of Pierre and Marie Curie's careers. Helene Langevin said that Marie Curie envisioned that scientists should have the necessary working conditions and life security, and hoped that her descendants could open up new fields for the happiness of mankind. She said that she saw that Marie Curie's ideals have been realized in New China.

American writer Alvah Bessie said at the conference: China's memorial meeting for Franklin itself provides a powerful rebuttal to the Washington officialdom's so-called "theory" that China is a hostile country to the United States. I see that China respects the democratic traditions of the American people. The United States, which was established under Franklin's anti-colonial banner, has now become the last pillar of colonialism in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, which is a historical regression. Bessie said: In the United States, Franklin's spirit is not dead. It lives as an inspiration to those in the United States who seek international friendship, peaceful coexistence, and democratic politics. Franklin's spirit will triumph in the United States. At that time, just as Beijing is holding a meeting to commemorate Franklin, we can also see meetings to commemorate Sun Yat-sen and Lu Xun being held in the United States.

Their speeches repeatedly aroused warm and prolonged applause.

Then, Zhou Peiyuan, Chairman of the Chinese Physical Society, announced at the meeting that Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, had sent a letter to the conference to express his congratulations. He also read out the congratulatory messages from Guo Moruo, Chairman of the conference, to Jordan, Chairman of the American Benjamin Franklin Bicentennial Celebration, Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, and Jan Dąbrowski, President of the Polish Academy of Sciences. At the memorial meeting, Chinese literary and art workers also recited Franklin's works and sang songs from China, the United States and other countries.

Also attending the memorial meeting were Wu Yuzhang, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Lao She and Ouyang Yuqian, members of the Presidium of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and more than 1,200 prominent figures from the capital's scientific and artistic circles.

Polish Ambassador to China, Kirylok, and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China were invited to attend the memorial meeting.

    富兰克林、皮埃尔·居里、玛丽·居里
    三位世界文化名人纪念会在京举行
    据新华社12日讯　世界文化名人美国科学家本杰明·富兰克林，法国科学家皮埃尔·居里和他的夫人、波兰科学家玛丽·居里纪念大会今天晚上在北京隆重举行。
    皮埃尔·居里、玛丽·居里的外孙女海伦娜·郎之万（前误发为郎云万）和她的丈夫、法国核子物理学家密歇尔·郎之万，波兰物理学家兹沃托夫斯基和泰斯开，美国作家阿贝·察佩克，应中国1956年纪念世界文化名人委员会邀请，参加了纪念大会。
    中国1956年纪念世界文化名人委员会还曾邀请许多美国科学家参加这次大会，并先后收到了十五名美国科学家的回信，他们感谢这一邀请，并表示由于得不到美国政府的护照而不能亲自来中国参加大会。世界和平理事会理事、美国历史学家、作家威廉·杜波依斯和世界科学工作者协会副主席、美国化学家莱纳斯·保林以及美国富兰克林诞生二百五十周年纪念会主席约丹等都来信向大会致贺。
    大会主席、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席、中国科学院院长郭沫若致开幕词（见第七版）。
    中国科学院副院长、物理学家吴有训在会上报告了“富兰克林的生平和他在科学上的贡献”。物理学家钱三强介绍了“居里夫妇生平”。兹沃托夫斯基代表波兰科学院在会上致词，他转达了波兰科学家们对于这次大会的祝贺。他说：站在新原子时代的门槛，我们比任何时候都更了解国际科学合作的重要性。科学越发展，就越需要世界上的相互了解和正义。科学家最大的责任就是尽力保证世界伟大的科学遗产永远不被误用来为毁灭性的目的服务。
    海伦娜·郎之万，代表她自己和她的丈夫、密歇尔·郎之万在大会上讲了话。她说，参加这次大会使他们非常激动。她介绍了皮埃尔·居里和玛丽·居里的事业的历史和意义。海伦娜·郎之万说，玛丽·居里曾经设想科学家们应该有必要的工作条件和生活上的保障，希望她的后代能为人类的幸福开辟新的领域。她说，她看到玛丽·居里的这些理想已经在新中国实现了。
    美国作家阿贝·察佩克在大会上说：中国这次纪念富兰克林的大会本身，就给予华盛顿官方当局所谓对美国说来中国是一个敌对的国家的“理论”，以有力的反驳，我看到中国尊敬美国人民的民主传统。在富兰克林反殖民主义旗帜下建立起来的美国，今天竟成为亚洲、拉丁美洲和非洲殖民主义的最后支柱，这是历史上的一个倒行逆施。察佩克说：在美国，富兰克林的精神并没有死，它正作为合众国那些寻找国际友谊、和平共处和民主政治的道路的人们的一种鼓舞而活着，富兰克林的精神将在美国得到胜利。那时就像北京举行纪念富兰克林的集会一样，也可以看到在美国举行纪念孙中山和鲁迅的大会。
    他们的讲话，一再激起了热烈的长时间的掌声。
    接着，中国物理学会理事长周培源在会上宣布，世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里曾来函对大会表示祝贺。他还宣读了大会主席郭沫若致美国富兰克林二百五十周年纪念会主席约丹，世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里和波兰科学院院长扬·邓博夫斯基的贺电。在纪念会上，还由中国文艺工作者朗诵了富兰克林的作品，演唱了中国、美国等国的歌曲。
    参加纪念会的还有中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会名誉主席吴玉章，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席陈叔通，中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南，中国文学艺术界联合会主席团委员老舍、欧阳予倩，以及首都科学界、文艺界著名人士等一千二百多人。
    波兰驻华大使基里洛克以及各国驻华外交官员应邀出席了纪念会。
