    The Kawa ethnic group, numbering over 250,000 hard-working and courageous people, resides within Yunnan Province in China. They are primarily distributed in areas such as Cangyuan, Lancang, Gengma, and Menglian.

    According to Kawa legends, they are an indigenous people who established kingdoms long ago. The area where the Kawa now live was historically known as the "Gourd Kingdom." Kawa men typically wear black cloths wrapped around their heads and carry long knives for self-defense and as tools when going out or working in the fields. The women enjoy adornments, wearing short, self-woven, colorful skirts and silver jewelry such as earrings, necklaces, and bracelets.

    The Kawa people mainly engage in agriculture, with some also hunting. They can generally manufacture their own production tools. In terms of handicrafts, there are carpenters and bamboo weavers, but they have not yet separated from agriculture.

    Social development in the Kawa region is uneven. In the peripheral areas, land is already privately owned and operated, and private land can be freely bought and sold. However, some wasteland, forests, pastures, and difficult-to-manage mountain areas are still collectively owned and used, or collectively owned but privately operated. In the central areas of the Kawa region, traces of past collective labor, such as communal farming, are still maintained.

    The central area of the Kawa region maintains a social system of tribal alliances and tribal councils. To this day, most areas still maintain the organizational form of "Meng." A "Meng" is composed of several "Gan" (also written as "Hang"), and a "Gan" is composed of several "Yang." A "Yang" generally includes several "Rupu" groups. The "Rupu" group has its own headman and a common cemetery; intermarriage within the "Rupu" is prohibited. The headman produced by each "Rupu" becomes the headman of the "Yang," and when matters concerning the entire "Yang" arise, a meeting of headmen is convened for discussion. A "Gan" has a specific land boundary and shared religious rituals. The "Meng" does not have a fixed organization or leader. The headman is a leader recognized by the masses, without special privileges, and participates in labor like everyone else; the masses have the right to remove him. In the peripheral areas, influenced by the Han people and the Tusi system, various hierarchical systems have emerged, such as princes, yamens, and Lang families, each with varying degrees of privilege.

    The Kawa people have various strict rules, and those who violate them are subject to "admonishment" and "fines," or even punishment. Those who do not work or engage in proper occupations are not allowed to exist. The elderly are highly respected, and everyone has a responsibility to support the old, weak, and disabled.

    Marriage among the Kawa is monogamous, based on voluntary union between men and women, and parents cannot force arranged marriages. Some Kawa people believe in Buddhism, while others believe in Christianity.

    The Kawa are a people who love to sing and dance. Each village has a wooden drum house. The wooden drum is used for sacrifices and as an alarm signal. Pulling the wooden drum is an opportunity for Kawa young men and women to entertain themselves, dancing and singing while pulling the drum.

    The productive forces in the Kawa region are low, and the people's lives are impoverished. After liberation, the economy, culture, and living standards of the Kawa people have rapidly developed and improved. In 1954 and 1955, the Gengma Dai-Kawa Autonomous County and the Menglian Dai-Lahu-Kawa Autonomous Region were established successively within Yunnan Province. The era that the Kawa people had long awaited, of being masters of their own destiny, had finally arrived. The People's Government has established trade companies and trade teams in the county towns and villages where the Kawa people live, actively supplying the production and daily necessities that the Kawa people need. In the past, the Kawa people did not have their own schools, and there were no educated people. By the end of 1955, Cangyuan County alone had established more than ten Kawa primary schools, with nearly a thousand Kawa children already attending school. Each county has established hospitals, and health teams have also been established in many rural areas.

    The area inhabited by the Kawa people has many fertile plains and pastures, and the climate is also very good, offering great potential for developing agricultural and animal husbandry production. The Kawa Mountains are rich in mineral resources, which are very beneficial for developing and improving the economic life of the Kawa people. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and with the mutual support of the people of all ethnic groups, the Kawa people will directly transition to socialist society.

    佧佤族
    在我国云南省境内，居住着二十五万多勤劳勇敢的佧佤族人民。他们主要分布在沧源、澜沧、耿马、孟连等地区。
    根据佧佤族自己的传说，他们是土著民族，很早以前曾经建立过王国。在现在佧佤族居住的地区，历史上曾称为“葫芦王国”。佧佤族的男子都喜欢用黑布包头，出门、下地都佩带长刀，作为防身武器，同时也用作生产工具。妇女们很喜欢装饰，她们穿着自己织的短花裙子，带耳环、项圈、手镯等银饰。
    佧佤族人民主要从事农业，也有些人兼事狩猎，一般的生产工具都能自己制造。在手工技艺方面，木匠、篾匠等都有，但都还没有同农业分离。
    佧佤族地区的社会发展是不平衡的。在边沿地区，田地已经私有私营，私有土地可以自由买卖。但是有些荒地、森林、牧场和经营条件困难的一部分山地，还是公有公用或公有私营。在佧佤族地区的中心区，还保持着过去共同劳动的一些痕迹，如共耕关系。
    佧佤族地区的中心区保持有部落联盟及部落会议的社会制度。至今大部分地区还保持有“勐”的组织形式。“勐”由几个“干”（又作“吭”）组成，“干”又由几个“央”组成。一个“央”中一般都包括几个“如布”集团。“如布”集团有自己的头人，有共同的墓地，“如布”内不通婚。由各个“如布”产生的头人即成为“央”的头人，遇到有关全“央”的事，召集头人会议商讨。“干”有一定的土地界线，有共同的宗教仪式。“勐”没有固定的组织和首领。头人是群众公认的首领，他没有特权，本身也一样地参加劳动，群众有权罢免他。在边沿地区由于受到汉族和土司制度的影响，产生了各种等级制度，如王子、衙门、郎家等，他们各有大小不同的特权。
    佧佤族内部有各种比较严格的规矩，违反规矩的人要受到“诫”和“罚”甚至惩办。不劳动，不务正业的，不许存在。对老人很尊敬，老弱残废，大家都有供养之责。
    佧佤族的婚姻是一夫一妻制，由男女双方自愿相结合，父母不能强迫包办。佧佤族人有的信仰佛教，有的信仰基督教。
    佧佤族是一个爱歌爱舞的民族。每个村寨都设有木鼓房。木鼓是作祭祀和警号用的。拉木鼓是佧佤族青年男女娱乐的机会，他（她）们在拉木鼓时跳舞唱歌。
    佧佤族地区生产力是低落的，人民生活是贫困的。解放后，佧佤族人民的经济、文化和人民生活很快得到了发展与改善。1954年和1955年在云南省境内先后建立了耿马傣族佧佤族自治县和孟连县傣族拉祜族佧佤族自治区。佧佤族人民盼望很久以来的当家作主的年代终于来到了。人民政府在佧佤族所在地的县城、农村中设立了贸易公司和贸易小组，积极地供应着佧佤族人民所需要的生产和生活必需品。佧佤族人民过去没有自己的学校，也没有读书的人，1955年底，仅沧源县就创办了十多所佧佤族小学，有近千名的佧佤族儿童已经上了学。各县都设立了卫生院，不少地区的农村中也建立了卫生小组。
    佧佤族人民居住的地区，还有很多肥沃的平坝子和牧场，气候也很好，在发展农、牧业生产上有很大潜力。佧佤山蕴藏着丰富的矿藏，这对于发展和改善佧佤族人民的经济生活是很有利的。在党和人民政府的领导下，在各民族人民的互相支援下，佧佤族人民将会直接过渡到社会主义社会。
