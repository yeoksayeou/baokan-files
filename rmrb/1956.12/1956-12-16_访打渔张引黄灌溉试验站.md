Visiting the Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Experiment Station
Xinhua News Agency reporter Song Jie

Recently, this reporter visited the Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Experiment Station near Bohai Bay in Shandong Province. This experiment station, established in the winter of 1953, has provided a series of data for the Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project, which began construction this year. It also demonstrates the bright prospects for developing millions of mu of saline-alkali wasteland near Bohai Bay.

When this reporter arrived, the grain crops in each experimental area of the station had already been harvested, but the signs of a good harvest could still be seen on those cotton plants laden with bolls. The 71 mu of winter wheat sown by this station this year has already been watered to prevent frost, and the horse-mane-like wheat leaves cover the ridges, foreshadowing an even greater harvest next year. But the vast plain around the station is still desolate.

Engineer Sun of the experiment station guided this reporter to visit the exhibition room they had set up to celebrate the first water release for irrigation in the Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project. The charts in the first part of the exhibition room illustrated that the 500-plus mu of land now cultivated by the station was originally wasteland. About 20% of it was sandy loam soil, which was barren due to a salt content of over 3%. Another 50% or so was sandy loam soil with a salt content of about 1%, which could only support the growth of alkali-tolerant weeds such as reeds and *Tribulus terrestris*. This situation is the epitome of the coastal plain, spanning over 200 li, that the Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project aims to develop. Seeing this, I couldn't help but ask myself: Can such saline-alkali wasteland really be turned into fertile farmland? But after seeing the second part of the exhibition room, my original doubts disappeared.

From the second year after its establishment, this irrigation experiment station began using the siphon Yellow River diversion irrigation method to irrigate the more than 500 mu of reclaimed wasteland, based on different soil qualities and salt content, and carried out a one-time flushing to remove salt, reducing the salt content of the soil from the original 1% to 2% to about 0.2%. The germination rate of cotton and wheat planted that year reached over 75% to 90%, with an average yield of 150 jin of seed cotton per mu and 289 jin of wheat per mu. After three consecutive years of irrigation experiments, the soil salt content has now dropped to a few parts per ten thousand, and it no longer has a harmful effect on the germination and growth of crops, thus greatly increasing yields. In sandy loam soil (i.e., reed and *Tribulus terrestris* land), wheat yields 554.96 jin per mu, and in bare land where nothing originally grew, wheat yields 510 jin per mu. This year, the station's trial planting of more than 200 mu of cotton generally yielded about 350 jin of seed cotton per mu, with the highest reaching 465 jin. Engineer Sun said: "The results of our experiments over the past few years have proven that after the completion of the Dayuzhang Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Project, the saline-alkali wasteland here, after being flushed and irrigated with Yellow River water, combined with agricultural technology measures, will transform the vast wasteland into fertile farmland in a few years."

In recent years, this station has also conducted experiments on crop rotation, intercropping, and planting multiple crops in the same soil. This year, the station's planting of more than ten crops, including cotton, wheat, millet, soybeans, corn, and peanuts, has achieved high yields. The annual yield of intercropped corn or soybeans, together with the summer harvest of wheat, reaches as high as 673 jin to 905 jin per mu.

As I left this experiment station, I kept recalling the words of Deputy Station Master Wang: "When you come back again, this barren coastal plain will have undergone a great transformation." A picture of alkali land transforming into fertile fields was displayed before my eyes.

    访打渔张引黄灌溉试验站
    新华社记者　宋杰
    最近记者访问了渤海湾附近的山东省打渔张引黄灌溉试验站。这个在1953年冬建立起来的试验站，已经为今年开工的打渔张引黄灌溉工程提供了一系列的资料，同时也显示了开发渤海湾附近几百万亩盐渍化荒地的美好远景。
    当记者来到这里时，试验站各试验区的粮食作物都已经收割完毕，但从那些结桃累累的棉棵上，仍能看到丰收的迹象。这个站今年播种的七十一亩冬小麦已经浇过了冻水，像马鬃一样的麦叶复盖着垄背，预示着明年更大的丰收。但这个站周围的广阔平原，却还是一片荒芜。
    试验站的孙工程师引导记者参观了他们为庆贺打渔张引黄灌溉工程首次放水浇地而陈设的展览室。展览室的第一部分的图表说明：这个站现在种植的五百余亩土地原来都是荒地，其中占20％左右的粉砂壤土地，由于含盐量达3％以上而寸草不生；另有占50％左右的粉砂壤土地，含盐量为1％左右，也仅能生长一些芦苇、马绊等耐碱的杂草。这个情况就是打渔张引黄灌溉工程所要开发的、纵横二百余里的滨海平原的缩影。看到这里，我不禁自问：这样的盐渍化荒地，真的能变为良田吗？但是当我看了展览室的第二部分，原来的怀疑就消失了。
    这个灌溉试验站从建站后的第二年，就开始利用虹吸引黄灌溉的办法，在开垦的五百多亩荒地里，根据不同的土质和含盐率灌溉不同的水量，进行了一次冲洗排盐，使土质的含盐率由原来的1％到2％，下降到0.2％左右。当年种植的棉花和小麦，出苗率达75％到90％以上，棉花平均每亩产籽棉一百五十斤，小麦每亩产二百八十九斤。经过连续三年的灌溉试验，现在土壤含盐率已下降到万分之几，对农作物的出苗和生长已不起危害作用了，因而产量大大提高。在粉砂壤土地里（即芦苇、马绊地），小麦每亩产五百五十四点九六斤，在原来寸草不长的光板地里，每亩小麦也产到五百一十斤。今年这个站试种的二百多亩棉花，一般的每亩产籽棉三百五十斤左右，最高的达四百六十五斤。孙工程师说：“我们几年试验的结果证明，在打渔张引黄灌溉工程建成以后，这里的盐渍化荒地，经过黄河水的冲洗灌溉，再加上农业技术措施的配合，几年后就会变辽阔的荒原为肥沃的良田。
    几年来，这个站还进行了轮作、复种和在同样的土壤里种植多种作物的试验。今年这个站种植的棉花、小麦、谷子、大豆、玉米、花生等十多种作物，都获得了高额产量。复种的玉米或大豆，连同夏季收获的小麦，每亩年产量高达六百七十三斤到九百零五斤。
    当我离开这个试验站时，一路上还在回忆着王副站长的话：“等你再来的时候，这个瘠薄的滨海平原就要大变了。”一幅碱地变良田的图画展示在我眼前。
