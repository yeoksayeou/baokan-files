    Rambling Talk on Streamlining
  　Lewen
    I have worked in state organs for quite some time, and I have heard two or three reports on streamlining, economizing, and tightening staffing. Every time I hear a report, I feel that without streamlining, we cannot face the country and the people. But after the report, the situation remains the same. The staffing of the organs has not been tightened, and the number of personnel has not decreased. On the contrary, the number of departments in the organs is increasing, and batches of personnel are entering the gates of our organs from all directions.

    Why does the organization become larger every year, even though we streamline every year? I think there are several reasons for this:

    Since liberation, there has been an unwritten rule in the organs called "regularization." "Regularization" is of course different from "guerrilla" tactics. No matter how big or small a matter is, the minister approves it to the director of the bureau, the director of the bureau approves it to the director of the section, the director of the section approves it to the chief of the unit, the chief of the unit approves it to the staff member and clerk, and it is passed down layer by layer, and reported back layer by layer. After several months, it is not handled well, and it becomes even more confusing. When the lower levels have something to ask the leading organs for instructions, they first go from the staff member and clerk to the chief of the unit, then to the director of the section, then to the director of the bureau, and then to the minister.... It seems that if there are fewer levels and fewer people, "regularization" cannot be "regularized." Of course, not all cadres are willing to do this, but since there are people, there must be work. Since there is work, there must be a system. At first, they feel uncomfortable, but slowly they feel at ease and have a clear conscience.

    Some people believe that: if there are more undertakings and more work, we must strengthen leadership. The way to strengthen leadership seems to be only to expand the organization and increase cadres. Although we do not oppose this across the board, the question is whether the organization can be smaller, whether the levels can be fewer, and whether the personnel can be streamlined, so that the organization can give full play to its role and the personnel can give full play to their talents?

    In a report I heard, it was said that a certain organ reduced from more than 100 people to dozens of people, and the work was still done well. This is a very convincing example. But where did the reduced personnel go? Did they go to the places most lacking in cadres? Did they go to the grassroots units? No, the personnel of the old organs were reduced, and new organs were established. The personnel reorganized from the original organs were not enough for the needs of the new organs, and a large number of personnel had to be added, and cadres had to be transferred from below. What problems did such streamlining solve?

    In streamlining and economizing, there is also a saying that administrative organs should be reduced, but public institutions should not be reduced, because public institutions not only need work, but also have income and do not need to be borne by the state. Therefore, if there are only a few film projection teams in a place, three full-time cadres can be set up to manage them; if a store only sells two yuan of goods a month, three salespersons can be set up. We want to ask the people who have this idea, is the money spent by the cadres of such "public institutions" the state's or the leading cadres' from their own pockets? I think that streamlining is not limited to administrative organs. All those who have too many people and too little work and waste the property of the state and the people should be streamlined. Otherwise, streamlining and economizing will not be thorough, and many public institutions will become "safe havens" and "air-raid shelters."

    Now, the central government is calling for increasing production and practicing economy and tightening staffing. Looking back at what we have done in streamlining over the past few years and learning the necessary lessons, I think it is beneficial.

    漫谈精简
  　乐闻
    在国家机关中工作的时间不算短，关于精简节约紧缩编制的报告也听过两三回了。每次听报告，都感到不精简确实无以对国家和人民。但报告过去了，境况还是依然。机关的编制并没有紧缩，人员并没有减少，相反地，机关部门越来越多，一批一批人员从四面八方走进了我们机关的大门。
    为什么年年精简，机构反而年年增大呢？我以为，原因有这么几个：
    解放以来，在机关中有一套不成文的条例，名为“正规”化。“正规”化当然有别于“游击”化，一件事不论大小，部长批给司、局长，司、局长批给处长，处长批给科长，科长批给科员、办事员，层层下达，又层层上报，办了几个月办不好，甚至愈弄愈糊涂。下面有事找领导机关请示，也是先从科员、办事员而科长，而处长，而司、局长，而部长……。似乎层次少了，人手少了，“正规”化就“化”不了。当然，不是所有干部都愿意这样做，但既然有人，不能没有工作，既有工作，不能没有制度，开始感到不习惯，慢慢就心安理得，问心无愧了。
    有人认为：事业多了，工作繁重了，就要加强领导。加强领导的办法，又似乎只有扩大机构，增加干部。虽然，我们并不一律反对这样，问题是机构可不可以小些，层次可不可以少些，人员可不可以精简些，以便使机构充分发挥其作用，人员能充分发挥其才能呢？
    我听过的一个报告中说到，某某机关从一百多人减少到几十个人，工作照样办好了，这是很有说服力的例子。但减少的人员到那里去了？到最缺乏干部的地方去了吗？到基层单位去了吗？不是，旧机关人员减少了，新的机关成立了，原来机关整编来的人员，还不够新的机关的需要，还要大量增加人员，还要从下面抽调干部，这样的精简，到底解决了一些什么问题？
    在精简节约中，还有一种说法，行政机关应该减，事业单位不能减，因为事业单位不只是工作需要，而且事业单位有收入，不要国家负担。因而一个地方只有几个电影放映队，可以设三个专职干部管理；一个门市部每月只卖两元钱的货，可以设三个售货员。我们要问问有这种想法的人，像这样的“事业单位”的干部所花的钱，到底是国家的还是领导干部从自己家当里拿出来的？我想，精简不限于行政机关，凡是人多事少的、浪费国家和人民财产的，都应该精简，否则，精简节约就不会彻底，许多事业单位将成为“避风港”和“防空洞”。
    现在，中央正在号召增产节约紧缩编制，回顾一下我们几年来在精简中做过的事，吸取必要的教训，我想是有好处的。
