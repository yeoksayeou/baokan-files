    Fully Launch Winter Production
    The CCP Wuxiang County Committee in Shanxi Province sent some cadres to visit farmers in fifteen agricultural cooperatives to ask: What should be done for winter production this year? The farmers said: Two things should be done this year: one is to develop sideline occupations to increase income; the other is to carry out as much basic construction as possible to prepare for increased agricultural production next year. This opinion is completely correct. If everyone acts according to this opinion, winter production this year can be done well.
    Why is it said that these opinions are completely correct? Because it conforms to the Party's policy of comprehensively developing agriculture, and it is also suitable for the current situation of winter production in rural areas.
    Our Party has always advocated developing diversified operations in rural areas with agriculture as the mainstay. The resolution on the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Party also emphasized: "Grain production is the foundation of the agricultural economy and must be given priority; at the same time, the production of cotton and other various economic crops must be developed in appropriate proportion, and animal husbandry and sideline production must be developed, as well as the diversified economy of agriculture." Wherever this policy is followed, the agricultural economy will develop and prosper in an all-round way.
    This year, our country's agricultural production has achieved great success, which everyone has seen. This year's natural disasters, especially floods, were no smaller than in 1954, but the output of various major crops not only greatly exceeded that of 1954, which was more severely affected by natural disasters, but also considerably exceeded that of 1955, which was a bumper year unprecedented. This is the result of the hard work of farmers across the country after they were organized, under the leadership of Party and government organs at all levels and the vast number of rural cadres. Of course, some shortcomings have also emerged in the great production movement. For example, many areas once relaxed their leadership over sideline production, causing many agricultural cooperatives and members to reduce their income. Although this phenomenon was corrected not long after, its impact has not been completely eliminated in some areas. This shows that wherever the Party's agricultural policy is not fully implemented, work will suffer. The farmers of Wuxiang are actually raising objections to this phenomenon.
    Why is it said that these opinions of the Wuxiang farmers are very suitable for the current situation of winter production in rural areas? This is because many farmers, and even some cadres of agricultural cooperatives, have shown excessive enthusiasm for sideline production, intentionally or unintentionally relaxing agricultural production, and in many areas, there has not been the same vigorous production upsurge as last winter. Of course, it is understandable that farmers, who have worked hard all year round, are willing to take advantage of the winter to engage in more sideline occupations to supplement their daily needs. As long as it is well organized and led, good results can be achieved. However, if this phenomenon is allowed to continue to develop, seriously affecting winter agricultural production, it will cause irreparable losses to next year's agricultural production.
    Chinese farmers have always had the habit of diversified operations. Agriculture and sideline occupations are actually closely integrated and inseparable. Only by appropriately developing sideline occupations can we effectively utilize the by-products of agricultural production, give full play to the role of full and semi-labor forces in rural areas, increase farmers' income, accumulate agricultural funds, and supply the needs of urban and rural people with a wide variety of sideline products. We must make rural cadres and farmers understand this principle, and we must not neglect sideline occupations. However, at the same time, we must explain clearly to rural cadres and the vast number of farmers that, as indicated in the resolution on the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, in the diversified operation of agriculture and sideline occupations, agricultural production is its foundation; and in agricultural production, grain production is its foundation. Whoever does not act according to this principle will make a major error in principle. Think about it, if there is no grain, or very little grain, how can sideline production be developed? Even if some sideline products are produced, what is the use? People cannot engage in sideline occupations on an empty stomach, and besides, the raw materials for the vast majority of sideline products come directly or indirectly from agriculture.
    There is a lot of content in winter production: we must carry out farmland capital construction, we must carry out field management of overwintering crops, and we must carry out various kinds of sideline production. There will inevitably be certain contradictions in the arrangement of manpower, funds, and time among various production projects. For example, contradictions may arise between agricultural production and sideline production, contradictions may arise between agricultural capital construction and field management of overwintering crops, and contradictions may also arise between collective sideline occupations and the household sideline occupations of cooperative members. We should use the method of overall planning and focusing on key points to solve these contradictions, and we should not go to extremes and neglect one side. Each agricultural cooperative should make an all-round plan based on actual conditions and needs. The field management of winter crops is directly related to the success or failure of next year's agricultural production, and considerable manpower and material resources must be allocated to do it well first. Farmland capital construction that is necessary for developing production and that the agricultural cooperative can afford should be done as much as possible. However, do not be greedy for more and seek for bigger, and spread it out in an all-round way, but focus on key points and improve quality. On the premise of ensuring the completion of these two indispensable tasks, we must concentrate the manpower and material resources of the whole cooperative to develop various sideline productions.
    Should we increase the proportion of agriculture, or should we increase the proportion of sideline occupations? This should be determined according to the different situations of each agricultural cooperative. Generally speaking, agricultural cooperatives that have increased production and increased the income of most members can appropriately engage in more farmland capital construction to prepare more fully material conditions for next year's agricultural production. All sideline productions that can be operated should also be operated as much as possible to meet the requirements of the vast number of members. Agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas, agricultural cooperatives in non-disaster areas that have reduced production, and agricultural cooperatives that have not increased production should use greater efforts to engage in sideline occupations. This is the most effective way to increase the income of members, increase their confidence in overcoming difficulties, and overcome the spring famine next year. However, farmland capital construction that requires little effort and yields quick results should also be actively carried out whenever possible, and should not be relaxed.
    In order to fully launch winter production, grassroots cadres must bear the glorious and huge responsibility. Think about it, if there had not been the tireless work of thousands of grassroots cadres last winter and this spring, how could the powerful production upsurge have been formed? The winter production in many areas this year is also well done. Without the correct leadership of grassroots cadres, how could this be imagined? The reason why winter production in some areas has not been well launched is because some cadres have not correctly recognized the achievements and shortcomings of agricultural production this year, and are afraid of making mistakes of subjectivism and coercion. They do not dare to boldly lead winter production, and when they see that some members only want to engage in sideline occupations and do not want to engage in agriculture, they do not dare to actively offer opinions. This attitude should be changed. As mentioned earlier, the achievements in agricultural production this year are very great. In this huge achievement, every grassroots cadre has a share, and the Party and the people see it very clearly. Of course, in the large-scale production movement, some shortcomings and errors are inevitable. Because grassroots cadres and the masses of farmers live together day and night and have direct contact with each other, they are more likely to hear the discussions and opinions of the masses of farmers, and even receive some complaints from the masses of farmers. We should tell these comrades: the reason why some shortcomings and errors occurred in agricultural production this year is mainly because both leaders and the masses lack experience. The subjective and bureaucratic leadership style of leading organs often leads to the mistakes of coercion among grassroots cadres. The leading organs should be responsible for this. Now everyone is summing up the experiences and lessons of this year, and in future work, errors and shortcomings will be greatly reduced. As long as these principles are explained clearly to the masses of farmers, the masses will understand the grassroots cadres.
    As long as all grassroots cadres can accept past experiences and lessons, actively and boldly take responsibility, promote the good style of "consulting with the masses on everything," and overcome the shortcomings of relying on administrative means to handle affairs, winter production this year can achieve good results, and the masses of farmers will further firmly take the road of cooperation. We can completely do this, and we must do this.

### 全面开展冬季生产

    全面开展冬季生产
    中共山西武乡县委派了一些干部，深入到十五个农业社中访问农民：今年的冬季生产应该作些什么？农民们说：今年应该作两件事情：一件是发展副业，增加收入；一件是尽量搞些基本建设，给明年的农业增产作准备。这个意见完全正确。大家如果都照这个意见办事，今年的冬季生产就可以作好。
    为什么说这些意见是完全正确的呢？因为它既符合党的全面发展农业的方针，又适合当前农村冬季生产的情况。
    我们党历来主张在农村中发展以农业为主的多种经营。党的第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议又着重指出：“粮食生产是农业经济的基础，必须优先发展；同时也必须按照适当的比例发展棉花和其他各种经济作物的生产，并且发展畜牧业和副业生产，发展农业的多种经济。”哪个地区、哪个农业社照着这个方针办事，哪里的农业经济就会全面地发展和繁荣起来。
    今年我们国家的农业生产取得很大的成绩，大家都是看见了的。今年的自然灾害，特别是水灾，并不小于1954年，各种主要农作物的产量，却不仅大大地超过了自然灾害较重的1954年，而且相当地超过了空前丰收的1955年。这是全国农民组织起来以后，在各级党政机关和广大农村干部领导下，辛勤劳动的结果。当然，在大生产运动中，也出现过一些美中不足的现象。譬如，不少地区曾经一度放松了对副业生产的领导，使许多农业社和社员减少了一些收入。这种现象虽然没有多久就被纠正了，但是，它的影响在某些地区还没有完全消除。由此可见，哪里如果没有全面地执行党的农业政策，哪里的工作就会受到损失。武乡的农民实际上是对这种现象提出了意见。
    为什么说武乡农民这些意见很适合当前农村冬季生产的情况呢？这是因为不少地区的农民，甚至某些农业社的干部，对副业生产表现了过分的积极性，有意无意地放松了农业生产，许多地区没有出现去年冬季那样的轰轰烈烈的生产热潮。当然，农民整年劳动，为了补充家常日用，愿意利用冬季多搞一些副业，这种心情是可以理解的。只要很好地加以组织领导，一定可以取得很好的成绩。但是，如果听任这种现象继续发展下去，严重地影响了冬季的农业生产，那就会使明年的农业生产造成不能弥补的损失。
    我国农民从来就有多种经营的习惯。农业和副业实际上是密切结合不可分割的。只有适当地发展副业，才能有效地利用农业生产的副产品，充分发挥农村全劳力和半劳力的作用，增加农民的收入，积累农业资金，并以多种多样的副业产品供应城乡人民的需要。我们要使农村干部和农民懂得这个道理，千万不能忽视副业。但是，我们同时要向农村干部和广大农民说明白：正像党的第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议所指示的，在农副业多种经营中，农业生产是它的基础；而在农业生产中，粮食生产又是它的基础。谁不按照这个道理办事，谁就要犯原则性的大错误。想想看，如果没有粮食，或者粮食很少，怎样能够发展副业生产？就算生产了一些副业产品，又有什么用处呢？人不能饿着肚子搞副业，何况绝大多数副业产品的原料，又是直接间接地来自农业呢？
    冬季生产的内容是很多的：要进行农田基本建设，要进行越冬作物的田间管理，要进行各种各样的副业生产。在各种生产项目之间，在人力、资金、时间的安排上，当然会发生一定的矛盾。比如，农业生产和副业生产可能发生矛盾，农业方面的基本建设和越冬作物的田间管理可能发生矛盾，副业方面的集体副业和社员的家庭副业也可能发生矛盾。我们应该用统筹兼顾、掌握重点的方法解决这些矛盾，而不应该走向极端，偏废一面。每个农业社都应该根据实际情况和需要，作一个照顾全面的规划。冬季作物的田间管理，直接关系明年农业生产的好坏，必须调配相当的人力、物力，首先把它作好。凡是发展生产所必需、又是农业社力能担任的农田基本建设，应该尽可能地把它们做好。但是不要贪多求大，全面铺开，而要掌握重点，提高质量。在保证完成这两方面必不可少的工作的前提下，要集中全社的人力、物力，发展各种副业生产。
    究竟应该把农业比重放大一些，还是把副业比重放大一些？这要按照各个农业社的不同情况来决定。一般地说，全社增加了生产、多数社员增加了收入的农业社，可以适当地多搞一些农田基本建设，给明年的农业生产准备更充分的物质条件。一切可以经营的副业生产，也应该尽可能地经营起来，以满足广大社员的要求。灾区的农业社、非灾区减产的和没有增产的农业社，应该用更大的力量经营副业，这是增加社员的收入，提高社员克服困难的信心，战胜明年春荒的最有效的办法。但是，费力不多、收益较快的农田基本建设，凡是可以举办的，也应该积极举办，不要放松。
    为了把冬季生产全面地开展起来，基层干部要负起光荣的、巨大的责任。大家想想，在去冬今春，如果没有千千万万基层干部废寝忘食的劳动，那声势浩大的生产高潮怎样能够形成呢？今年许多地区的冬季生产搞得也好，如果没有基层干部的正确领导，这怎样可以想像呢？现在有些地区的冬季生产没有很好地开展起来，就因为有些干部没有正确地认识今年农业生产的成绩和缺点，害怕犯主观主义、强迫命令的错误。他们不敢大胆地领导冬季生产，看见某些社员只想搞副业，不想搞农业，也不敢积极地提出意见。这种态度应该改变过来。前边已经说过，今年农业生产的成绩是很大的。在这个巨大的成绩中，每个基层干部都有一份，党和人民是看得很清楚的。当然，在大规模的生产运动中，难免产生一些缺点和错误。由于基层干部和农民群众朝夕相处，直接发生各种接触，他们更加容易听到农民群众的议论和意见，甚至受到农民群众的一些埋怨。我们应该告诉这些同志：今年农业生产中所以产生了一些缺点和错误，主要是因为领导和群众都缺乏经验。领导机关的主观主义、官僚主义的领导作风，常常会使基层干部产生强迫命令的错误。这一点，领导机关应该负责。现在大家都在总结今年的经验教训，在今后的工作中，错误、缺点就会大大减少了。只要把这些道理向农民群众说清楚，群众是会谅解基层干部的。
    只要所有的基层干部都能接受过去的经验教训，积极大胆地负起责任，发扬“遇事和群众商量”的优良作风，克服依靠行政手段办事的缺点，今年的冬季生产就可以得到良好的成绩，农民群众就会进一步地坚定地走合作化的道路。我们完全可以作到这一点，我们一定要作到这一点。
