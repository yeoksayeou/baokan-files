　　Actively Prevent and Treat Occupational Diseases
　　By Our Correspondent　Xi Ping
    Currently, many enterprises and leading organizations have already done and are doing a lot of work in caring for the lives of their employees. However, one area has not received enough attention, and that is the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases in industrial production.
    Occupational diseases have historically been a major problem in Shanghai, claiming the health and lives of countless workers. Since liberation, Shanghai's health departments and industrial departments have done much work in the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau organized experts to go into factories to investigate and study methods for preventing and treating occupational diseases. Last year, professors and other experts from Shanghai's two medical colleges wrote ten research reports on the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases based on their research findings. This past April, Shanghai established its first Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment Institute. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has also designated eleven hospitals to be responsible for diagnosing and treating patients with occupational diseases. The health departments have also urged factories to improve and install protective equipment, improve production hygiene and work systems, and increase workers' nutrition. Through these measures, the situation of occupational diseases in Shanghai factories has greatly improved compared to the pre-liberation era. For example, the occurrence of new cases of silicosis, a serious occupational disease in the stone powder industry, has been basically halted. Many serious occupational diseases and occupational poisoning now have methods for prevention and treatment.
    However, the work in Shanghai to prevent and treat occupational diseases is still far from meeting objective needs. According to statistics from the Health Bureau over the past few years, more than twenty types of occupational diseases and occupational poisoning have been identified in Shanghai's light and heavy industrial sectors. The main product of the jointly owned Huaxing Chemical Glass Instrument Factory is mercury thermometers. Because the factory lacks reliable protective devices, mercury evaporates during the heating process and enters the human body. Of the original seven workers in the mercury filling section, six have already left their original jobs due to varying degrees of mercury poisoning. Currently, only one person is persisting in his work. The factory's union chairman told me: "Occupational diseases pose a great threat to production. If our last comrade also develops mercury poisoning, then our factory's production will have to stop." There are twenty-six factories in Shanghai that produce mercury thermometers, and the situation in several factories is similar to that of Huaxing Factory.
    I visited the fur warehouse, where anthrax is easily contracted. It is piled with large quantities of raw hides from various places. Warehouse staff told me that the quarantine system is not strict, and some raw hides carry anthrax bacteria from the place of origin. If this bacterium infects people, they will suffer from skin anthrax, lung anthrax, and other diseases. In the first half of this year, Shanghai health departments found nine cases of occupational anthrax, eight of which were in the Shanghai Animal Products Company system. After research between the Shanghai health departments and the Animal Products Company, improvements have now been made in personal protection and hygiene systems, and workers have been vaccinated against anthrax. Comrades from the Animal Products Company told me: To eliminate anthrax, on the one hand, we must continue to urge our affiliated processing plants and warehouses to strictly implement various hygiene systems and improve equipment, but more importantly, the central responsible authorities must effectively supervise the implementation of on-site quarantine in various fur producing areas, and be sure not to send out hides carrying anthrax bacteria.
    Occupational diseases in industrial production involve many complex scientific and technological problems and practical issues. We had a very poor foundation in this area. At the same time, it is impossible to fundamentally improve the labor equipment conditions of our existing factories in the short term, so it is difficult to completely solve all occupational disease problems at present. However, many occupational diseases in industrial production already have methods that can be controlled and treated today. For example, for several major occupational diseases and occupational poisoning that have already been exposed in Shanghai factories, such as silicosis, aniline poisoning, mercury poisoning, gasoline poisoning, lead poisoning, anthrax, and chromium poisoning, Shanghai has researched a set of prevention and treatment methods, and these should be addressed with positive measures. This is what the workers are asking for.
    Some comrades told me that there are generally two reasons for neglecting the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases. The main reason is that many comrades lack scientific health knowledge in this area, and because most occupational diseases are chronic, it is easy to underestimate their harm. I once attended a briefing meeting on the situation of occupational diseases convened by the Shanghai municipal leading organs. When comrades from the health departments reported on the serious situation of occupational diseases, some responsible comrades from the industrial departments were greatly astonished. One comrade said: "This is the first time I've heard that severe lead poisoning can cause paralysis, and mercury poisoning can cause memory loss. I didn't expect it to be so serious." Such a lack of knowledge about occupational diseases is even more common in grassroots units. Many enterprise leaders in Shanghai are not familiar with occupational diseases in their own factories. The factory director and chief engineer only ask about industrial accidents but not about this matter, and some hand it over to the labor and wage department or the general affairs department, and these comrades don't even know what poisoning is. In this way, some occupational diseases, which could have been prevented by spending very little money and taking some simple measures, have developed. For example, in the electroplating industry, for chromic acid poisoning, some scientists in Shanghai proposed two preventive methods a long time ago. One is to install ventilation equipment to reduce the chromium acid content in the air to a level that does not affect human health. If some small factories are unable to install this equipment, workers can wear masks or apply some medicines, which can also prevent poisoning. Both of these methods are simple and easy to implement, but in Shanghai, there are some electroplating factories that still do not take preventive and treatment measures even after chromic acid poisoning has occurred, and regard it as a trivial matter.
    Another situation is that there are individual enterprise leaders who generally know the harm of occupational diseases, but under the influence of the capitalist management ideology of only focusing on production and neglecting workers' health, they often turn a blind eye and do not seriously solve it by including it in their work agenda. Comrades from the Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Station once told me about an incident that occurred in several battery factories in Shanghai not long ago: The production of batteries requires the use of a lead compound, red and yellow lead powder. Because some battery factories do not have protective equipment, many direct operators have suffered from lead poisoning. In order to prevent the continued expansion of lead poisoning, the Shanghai Municipal Health Department suggested that the production of red and yellow lead powder be concentrated in a factory with better production equipment, and other factories could purchase it separately when they need to use red and yellow lead powder. Originally, this was a reasonable suggestion, but the factories concerned believed that this would increase costs (although the increase was limited), and continued to allow workers to engage in production under unsafe conditions, and refused to adopt this method which was beneficial to workers' health and also to production. Similar situations also exist in some other enterprises in Shanghai.
    In the work of preventing and treating occupational diseases, the close cooperation and collaboration between local health departments and industrial departments is very important. Shanghai has better conditions for preventing and treating occupational diseases than other places. There are experts and relatively sound medical institutions here, but the positive factors in this area have not been fully mobilized. The cooperative relationship between Shanghai's industrial departments and health departments in this area is not close enough. The health departments are also not proactively reflecting the situation to the industrial departments systematically, and there is still a mindset of neglecting this work among some medical staff. The industrial departments lack consideration of integrating the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases with production. In order to do a good job in the cooperation between industrial and health departments, it is best to have a certain organizational form or system to ensure it in the future. In addition, the most fundamental way to prevent and treat occupational diseases is still the technical transformation of enterprises. Therefore, in the future, factories should combine the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases with the technical transformation of enterprises, and regard the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases as one of the technical transformation projects. In short, a city like Shanghai, where industry is concentrated, needs a plan for preventing and treating occupational diseases and occupational poisoning. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has drafted a plan for the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases, but it has not yet been discussed and determined. The health department believes that a unified leading organization for the prevention and treatment of occupational diseases should be established in Shanghai, with the industrial department as the main body and other departments participating at the same time, to uniformly plan and study the city's prevention and treatment work. This suggestion is worth considering.

　　积极防治职业病
　　本报记者　习平
    现在，许多企业和领导机关在关心职工生活方面，都已经做了和正在做许多工作。但是有一件工作还没有引起足够的注意，这就是工业生产中的职业病的防治问题。
    职业病在上海历史上一直就是一个大问题，它不知曾夺去了多少工人的健康和生命。解放后，上海卫生部门和工业部门在防治职业病方面曾做了许多工作，上海市卫生局曾组织了一些专家深入到工厂，调查和研究职业病的防治办法。去年，上海的两个医学院的教授和其他专家们把研究的结果写成了十篇关于防治职业病的研究报告。今年4月，上海又建立了历史上第一个职业病防治所。上海市卫生局还指定了十一个医院负责诊治职业病的患者。卫生部门还督促工厂改进和装置了防护设备，改善了生产卫生和工作制度，增加了工人的营养。通过这些措施，上海工厂中职业病的情况比解放前已有很大的改进，如石粉业中严重的职业病硅肺病已基本上制止了新病例的发生，不少严重的职业病和职业中毒，都已有了防治的方法。
    但是，上海在防治职业病方面的工作，还远不能满足客观的需要。根据卫生局几年来的资料统计，在上海全市各轻重工业部门内，目前已经发现的职业病和职业中毒主要的有二十多种。公私合营华兴化学玻璃仪器厂主要产品是水银温度计，因为厂内没有可靠的防护装置，水银在加热过程中向外蒸发，侵入了人体，厂内贯注水银工段原来有工人七个，已经有六个人因为患了程度不等的水银中毒症而离开了原工作岗位，目前只有一个人在坚持工作。厂的工会主席对我说：“职业病给生产的威胁太大了，假如我们最后一个同志也有了水银中毒症，那我们工厂的生产就只好停止了。”上海从事水银温度计生产的工厂有二十六家，好几个厂的情况和华兴厂相仿。
    我曾访问了最容易感染炭疽病的毛皮仓库，这里堆积着来自各地的大量生皮。仓库的工作人员告诉我：目前检疫制度不严格，有些生皮从产地运来时就带有炭疽菌，这种病菌传染给人，就会患皮肤炭疽、肺炭疽等病症。今年上半年，上海卫生部门曾发现了九个职业性炭疽病病例，其中有八个就是上海畜产公司系统的。上海卫生部门和畜产公司研究后，现在已在个人防护和卫生制度方面作了改进，工人们都接种了炭疽疫苗。畜产公司的同志对我说：消灭炭疽病一方面是我们要继续督促所属加工厂及仓库严格执行各项卫生制度，改进设备，但更重要的是要中央负责机关切实督促各处皮毛产地实行就地检疫，千万不要把带有炭疽病菌的皮张送出来。
    工业生产中的职业病牵涉到许多复杂的科学技术问题和实际问题，我们在这方面原有基础很差。同时，我们现有工厂的劳动设备条件也不可能在短期内全部作根本的改善，因此要在目前彻底解决所有职业病问题是困难的。但是，工业生产中的职业病，有许多今天已经有了可能加以控制和治疗的方法。例如，目前上海工厂中已经暴露的几种主要的职业病和职业中毒，像硅肺、苯胺中毒、汞中毒、汽油中毒、铅中毒、炭疽病、铬中毒等，上海都已研究出了一套防治的办法，这些就应当采取积极措施来着手防治。工人们所要求的也就是如此。
    一些同志对我说：忽视职业病防治工作大体上有两种情况，主要是不少同志缺乏这方面的科学卫生知识，同时职业病多数又是慢性的，因此很容易对它的危害认识不足。我曾经参加了一次上海市领导机关召开的关于职业病情况的汇报会议。当卫生部门的同志汇报职业病的严重情况时，有一些工业部门的负责同志大为惊异。有一位同志说：“我第一次听到严重的铅中毒会使人瘫痪，汞中毒会使人记忆力减退，想不到竟这样严重。”像这样对职业病缺乏知识的情况，在基层单位就更普遍。上海不少企业的领导干部都不熟悉本厂职业病，厂长、总工程师只问工伤事故而不问这件事，有的把它交给劳动工资科、总务科，这些同志甚至不知道什么是中毒。这样，有些职业病本来只要花很少的钱，采取一些简单的措施就可以防止的，结果也发展了。例如电镀工业中的铬酸中毒症，上海的一些科学家很早就提出两种预防方法，一是装置通风设备，使铬酸空气中的含量降低到不会影响人体健康的程度，如果某些小厂无力设置这种设备，可以让工人佩戴口罩，或擦抹一些药物，同样可以防御中毒，这两种方法都是简单易行的，但是在上海就有一些电镀厂，甚至已发生铬酸中毒后，仍不采取预防和治疗措施，把它看成无关轻重的事情。
    另一种情况是：有个别企业的领导者，他们大体上也知道职业病的危害性，但在只重生产，漠视工人健康的资本主义经营思想影响下，常常听之任之，而不把它列入自己的工作日程中去认真解决。上海市卫生防疫站的同志曾经告诉我不久前在上海几个蓄电池厂中发生的一件事：生产蓄电池需要使用一种铅化合物红黄丹粉，因为一些蓄电池厂没有防护设备，许多直接操作的工人得了铅中毒。为了防止铅中毒继续扩大，上海市卫生部门曾建议把红黄丹粉的生产集中到一个生产设备较好的工厂去进行，其他各厂要使用红黄丹粉时，可以分别采购。本来，这是一个合理的建议，但有关工厂认为这样会增加成本（其实所增有限），仍继续让工人在不安全的情况下从事生产，而不肯采纳这个对工人健康有利，也对生产有利的办法。类似的这种情况，在上海其他一些企业里也有。
    在防治职业病的工作中，当地卫生部门与工业部门的密切配合和协作是非常重要的。上海防治职业病的条件比别的地方好，这里有专家和比较健全的医疗机构，但目前这方面的积极因素还没有被完全调动起来。上海工业部门和卫生部门在这方面的协作关系还不够密切。卫生部门主动向工业部门系统地反映情况也还不够，在某些医务工作人员中还存在忽视这一工作的思想。工业部门则缺乏把防治职业病工作与生产统一起来考虑。为了做好工业与卫生部门的合作，今后最好能有一定的组织形式或制度来加以保证。另外，防治职业病的最根本途径还是企业的技术改造。因此，今后工厂中应该把防治职业病与企业技术改造结合起来，把防治职业病作为技术改造的项目之一。总之，像上海这样一个工业集中的城市，防治职业病和职业中毒很需要一个规划。上海市卫生局已拟出了一个防治职业病的规划，但直到现在还没有讨论确定。卫生部门认为，需在上海成立一个以工业部门为主、其他各部门同时参加的防治职业病的统一领导机构，统一规划和研究全市防治工作，这个建议是值得考虑的。
