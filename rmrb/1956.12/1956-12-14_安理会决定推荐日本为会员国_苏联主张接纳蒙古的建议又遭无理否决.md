Xinhua News Agency, December 13th, New York dispatch: The Security Council on December 12th unanimously decided to recommend Japan for membership in the United Nations.

After making this decision, the Security Council discussed the Soviet representative's proposal to admit the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations. Based on the discussions in the previous General Assembly regarding the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations, as well as the history and achievements of the Mongolian People's Republic, its growing diplomatic relations, and its foreign policy dedicated to maintaining international peace and the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Soviet representative, Sobolev, spoke in support of the Mongolian People's Republic's admission to the United Nations. He said that the Soviet delegation hoped that the Security Council would fulfill its responsibilities and recommend that the General Assembly admit the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations, in order to end the unjust treatment of the Mongolian People's Republic.

Subsequently, the Soviet proposal was put to a vote. The results were as follows: the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Iran, and Peru voted in favor; Cuba and the Chiang Kai-shek clique voted against; and the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Australia abstained. The Soviet proposal was rejected.

After the vote, many delegations spoke to explain their reasons for voting. The US representative, Lodge, said that the United States had opposed and would always oppose the admission of the Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations. Lodge implied that he did not cast a negative vote because it was unnecessary to do so. The US's purpose was achieved by the Chiang Kai-shek clique casting a veto.

The representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and Australia, who had voted in favor of admitting the Mongolian People's Republic as a member of the United Nations at the Tenth Session of the General Assembly, attempted to justify their cunning tactics by using the so-called "unfavorable" international situation for admitting the Mongolian People's Republic as an excuse.

The Soviet representative, Sobolev, spoke again. He said that the representatives of certain Western countries had once again demonstrated that they completely disregarded the opinions of the vast majority of member states. This time, in addition to the open veto of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, there were also the disguised vetoes of some abstaining Western countries (the United States, the United Kingdom, and France).

The statement by the US representative, Lodge, showed who was backing the Chiang Kai-shek clique. Lodge should be held fully responsible for the Mongolian People's Republic not being admitted to the United Nations. The actions of the United States and its clique in the Security Council exposed them as opponents of the principle of equality for large and small nations, and as opponents of the principle of universality of the United Nations and the principle of cooperation among peoples of all countries. The refusal of Western countries to recognize the principle of universality of the United Nations, which is recognized by the vast majority of members of the United Nations, proves that these countries do not care at all about the smooth and successful activities of our organization.

    安理会决定推荐日本为会员国
    苏联主张接纳蒙古的建议又遭无理否决
    新华社13日讯　纽约消息：安全理事会12月12日一致决定向联合国大会推荐日本为会员国。
    在作出这个决定以后，安全理事会讨论苏联代表提出的要求接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的建议。苏联代表索波列夫根据上一届大会讨论蒙古人民共和国加入联合国问题的情况，和蒙古人民共和国建国的历史、成就和它日益发展的外交关系和致力于维护国际和平和联合国宪章原则的外交政策，发言支持蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。他说，苏联代表团希望安全理事会履行它的职责，建议大会接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国，以结束对蒙古人民共和国的不公正对待。
    接着，对苏联提案进行表决，表决结果是苏联、南斯拉夫、伊朗和秘鲁赞成，古巴和蒋介石分子反对，美国、英国、法国、比利时和澳大利亚弃权。苏联的建议遭到否决。
    在投票以后，许多代表团发言解释投票理由。美国代表洛奇说，美国过去和将来永远反对接纳蒙古人民共和国加入联合国。洛奇暗示说，他没有投反对票是因为没有必要这样做。美国的目的由于蒋介石分子投否决票而达到了。
    在大会第十届会议上曾经投票赞成接纳蒙古人民共和国为联合国会员国的英国、法国和澳大利亚代表企图用所谓国际局势“不利于”接纳蒙古人民共和国作借口，来为自己的狡猾手法辩解。
    苏联代表索波列夫再次发言。他说，某些西方国家代表再一次表明他们完全忽视绝大多数会员国的意见。这一次除蒋介石分子的公开否决以外，还加上了一些弃权的西方国家（美国、英国和法国）的经过伪装的否决。
    美国代表洛奇的发言表明了究竟谁在为蒋介石分子撑腰，洛奇应该对蒙古人民共和国没有被接纳入联合国负完全责任。美国和它的一伙在安理会的行动，暴露了它们是大小国家平等原则的反对者，是联合国的普遍性原则和各国人民合作原则的反对者。西方国家拒绝为联合国绝大多数会员国所公认的联合国普遍性的原则，证明这些国家根本不关心我们这个组织的顺利圆满的活动。
