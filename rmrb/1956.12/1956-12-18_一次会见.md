    A Meeting
    Li Na
    During lunch, my wife casually mentioned an old man in his sixties who lived next door. For nearly two years, this old man had been sweeping the alley, which was a little over half a mile long, with his own broom. When the wind blew, he would sweep it twice a day, and on snowy days he would work almost all day. When children threw stones in the alley, he would pick them up one by one and put them in a basket. He would also help people sweep window ledges and courtyards. As a result, the alley had maintained its reputation for cleanliness for two years.
    My husband listened to my wife's description, and he was quite moved. He said his usual phrase:
    "Since liberation, people's mental outlook has also changed." He said he wanted to meet this admirable person. My wife was very happy because my husband rarely showed such interest in what she said, so she said, "I'll go see if he's sweeping right now, and I'll invite him over." My wife went out for a while, but came back disappointed and said, "He won't come. He says he's busy sweeping and doesn't have time to talk."
    My husband asked my wife in surprise, "Did you say that I invited him?" My wife nodded. My husband was even more surprised: "What? I invited him, and he still won't come? Sweeping can be done anytime!"
    My husband straightened his coat collar and went to work.
    After dinner, my wife finally brought the stubborn old man over. When she reached the door, my wife loudly told my husband, "The comrade you wanted to see at noon is here!" My husband was looking down at the newspaper and couldn't remember whom he had invited at noon. When he looked at the door, he saw an old man with a limp, holding a large broom in both hands. Only then did he vaguely remember that he had said he wanted to meet this person.
    My husband very solicitously invited the old man to sit on the sofa and poured him tea, but the old man found a chair and sat down. My husband said, "You've been my neighbor for several years, and I didn't even know it. I'm truly sorry." The old man said, "You're busy with work every day, how could you have time for these trivial matters?" He said, smiling kindly. "Are you in good health?" "Thanks to Chairman Mao, I don't have any ailments." "How many people are in your family?"
    "My wife, a son, a daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren." "So, only one person is earning money." "My son is a fitter in a factory." "I heard that you sweep the alley for everyone every day. I invited you here to express my respect." The old man smiled kindly again, "Don't say that. To tell you the truth, I'm used to working and can't stand being idle. Idleness makes people sick. Everyone is busy serving the people, and I should do my part for everyone..."
    My husband didn't have the patience to listen to the old man's words. He kept looking at the old man's feet. Later, he shouted loudly to my wife, "Bring that pair of shoes from under the bed for this comrade. His shoes are broken."
    The old man quickly stood up and said, "Comrade, I have shoes, I don't want..."
    My husband said, "Don't be polite, take them home and wear them. You've done two years of voluntary work for us, let me do a little bit for you."
    The old man said sincerely, "Comrade, Comrade, I sweep for everyone, not because I want a reward, but to respond to Chairman Mao's call..."
    Regardless of what the old man said, my husband stopped listening, stood up, found a newspaper, wrapped up the leather shoes, and stuffed them into the old man's hands. The old man pushed away the package and strode across the threshold. The package fell to the ground. My husband stood there blankly and said to my wife, "This person must be crazy!"

    一次会见
    李纳
    吃中饭的时候，妻子偶然讲到住在隔壁的一位六十多岁的老人。差不多有两年，这老人总是用自己的扫帚替这条长达一里的胡同扫地。遇着刮风，一天扫两次，下雪天几乎终日不停。小孩们在胡同里扔了石头，他便一个一个拣在筐里。有时还帮人扫窗台和院子。所以两年来，这条胡同一直保持着最清洁的荣誉。
    丈夫听着妻子的叙述，很有点感动。他说了平常爱说的一句话：
  “解放了，人的精神面貌也随着变化了。”他说他想见见这位可敬的人，妻子因为丈夫对自己的话难得这样有兴趣，很高兴，便说：“我去看看，他这时要在扫地，我就把他请来。”妻子出去一会，回去扫兴地说：“他不肯来，说正忙着扫地，没有功夫谈话。”
    丈夫很诧异地问妻子：“你是说我请他了吗？”妻子点点头，丈夫更诧异了：“怎么，我请他，他还不肯来？扫地，什么时候不能扫！”
    丈夫把大衣领整理一下，出门上班去了。
    晚饭后，妻子终于把那位固执的老人找来了。走到门口，妻子便大声告诉丈夫：“你中午要见的那位同志来了！”丈夫正在低着头看报，想不起他中午曾约过什么人来，到门前一看，见一个腿有点跛的老人，双手抱着一把长大的扫帚，才依稀记得他是说过要见这个人的。
    丈夫很殷勤地请老人在沙发上坐下，又给他倒了茶，但老人却找了一把椅子坐着。丈夫说：“你和我作了几年的邻居，我还一点不知道，真是抱歉。”老头说：“你们每天工作多忙，那还有功夫管这些闲事。”说着宽厚地笑起来。“你身体还好吗？”“托毛主席的福，浑身上下一点病也没有。”“家里几口人？”
  “老伴、一个儿子、一个媳妇、两个孙子。”“这样说，只有一个人挣钱。”“儿子在工厂当钳工。”“听说你天天给这条胡同的人扫地，我找你来，是为了对你表示一点敬意。”老头又宽厚地笑起来：“不要这样说。不瞒你讲，作惯了活，闲不住。闲会让人生病的。大家都忙着为人民服务，我也该为大家尽点力……。”
    丈夫没有这份耐心倾听老人的话，他一直看着老人的脚。后来他大声叫妻子：“把床底下我那双鞋送给这位同志，他的鞋破了。”
    老人忙站起来说：“同志，我有鞋，我不要……”
    丈夫说：“不用客气，带着回去穿，你给我们尽了两年义务，也让我给你尽点义务。”
    老人诚恳地说：“同志，同志，我给大家扫地，不是想要报酬，是响应毛主席的号召……”
    不管老人说什么，丈夫不再听，站起来找张报纸包起皮鞋塞给老人。老人推开了纸包，大踏步跨出门槛。纸包掉在地下，丈夫茫然地站着，对妻子说：“这个人准是有神经病！”
