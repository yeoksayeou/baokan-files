Reactions to Criticism

    The people responsible for chaotic recruitment have already been criticized
    A letter from the China Metallurgical Construction Corporation Pipeline Installation General Company: The People's Daily's criticism on July 19th that the First and Second Companies under our corporation were chaotically recruiting workers is correct. Our corporation sent people to the Shenyang Labor Bureau for consultation and handling. After joint consultation, both parties agreed not only to allow the recruited on-the-job workers to return to Shenyang, but also to criticize the First and Second Companies and the comrades specifically responsible for the recruitment.

    Taking care of disabled soldiers at the station
    A letter from the Passenger Department of the Harbin Railway Administration: After the publication of the article "The Appeal of a Veteran" in the People's Daily on August 21st, our department conducted an investigation and learned that the Harbin Railway Station's passenger transport leadership had been instructed to strengthen employee education on loving and caring for disabled soldiers.

    Excessive working hours have been resolved
    A letter from the Employee Living Supply Department of the Beijing Railway Administration: After the People's Daily exposed on page two of August 24th that the excessive working hours of employees of the Beijing Railway Administration's Travel Service Section seriously affected their health, our department immediately formed a working group with the Travel Service Section and conducted investigations at six representative train and seven platform sales departments. After investigation, we decided to increase the section's staff by 259 people. In addition, we plan to abolish four sales departments, including Yongdingmen, and allocate personnel to more needed areas.

    No more hoarding of translators
    A letter from the Expert Studio of the First Automobile Works: The criticism of our factory in the letter "Rational Use of Translators" published on page two of the People's Daily on September 5th is correct. We have prepared a plan for the allocation and transfer of translator cadres based on the tasks for the fourth quarter of this year and the first half of next year so that as our factory's translation tasks decrease, the remaining translators can be sent to positions where they are needed.

    Studying how to reunite sailors with their families
    A letter from the Yangtze River Shipping Administration: The article "Let Sailors Reunite with Their Families" published in the People's Daily on September 10th has attracted our attention. We will hold a special meeting soon to study and handle this issue.

    Deteriorated medicine has been discontinued
    A letter from the Drug Inspection Institute of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau: After the People's Daily published the incident of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory's Compound Licorice Mixture Tablets turning black on October 21st, our institute immediately sent people to the factory to investigate. After investigation, the prescription used by the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory has benefits in terms of pharmacological action and efficacy and will not be harmful. However, because the prescription contains a large amount of licorice extract, it is not suitable for seasons or areas with a lot of water vapor, otherwise there will be a risk of mold and deterioration over time. Therefore, we have suggested to the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory to add appropriate auxiliary materials to the original prescription to solve the moisture absorption problem, and temporarily stop production until it is well resolved. We feel that the batch of drugs that has already been produced does not need to be recalled, but we should try to explain to the storage and use units to pay attention to moisture prevention and prevent mold and deterioration.

专栏：对批评的反应

　　对批评的反应
    对乱招工的人已经提出批评
    冶金工业管道安装总公司来信：7月19日人民日报批评我公司所属第一、二公司乱收工人是正确的。我公司曾派人赴沈阳劳动局进行协商处理。经共同商量，双方同意除让招收的在职工人返回沈阳外，并对一、二公司和具体负责招收的同志提出批评。
    车站上照顾荣军
    哈尔滨铁路管理局旅客处来信：8月21日人民日报发表“荣誉军人的呼吁”一文后，经我处调查了解，已对哈尔滨火车站客运领导方面提出，要他们加强教育员工爱戴和照顾荣军同志的措施。
    工作时间过长已经解决
    北京铁路管理局职工生活供应处来信：人民日报8月24日二版揭发了北京铁路管理局旅行服务段职工工作时间过长，严重地影响了职工身体健康一事后，我处即与旅行服务段组成工作组分别到有代表性的六个列车七个站台售货部进行调查。经过调查，我们决定给该段增加二百五十九人，另外准备撤消永定门等四个售货部，将人员分配到更需要的地方去。
    不再积压翻译人材
    第一汽车制造厂专家工作室来信：人民日报9月5日二版发表的“合理地使用翻译人材”一信对我厂的批评是正确的。我们已根据今年第四季度及明年上半年的任务，编制了翻译干部配备及输送计划，以便随着我厂翻译任务的减少，把剩余的翻译人材送到需要的岗位上去。
    正在研究让海员同家人团聚
    长江航运管理局来信：人民日报9月10日发表的“让海员同家人团聚”一文，已引起我们重视，我们将于最近召开专门会议研究处理这一问题。
    变质的药品已停止生产
    北京市公共卫生局药品检验所来信：人民日报10月21日刊登了北京市制药厂复方甘草合剂片变黑一事后，我所即派人去该厂进行了解。经调查，北京市制药厂所用的处方在药理作用和药效方面是有好处的，不会有害处。但因在处方中含甘草浸膏量大，故不适用于水蒸汽较多的季节或地区，否则时间一长将有霉败的危险。为此我们已建议北京制药厂，在原处方中加入适当辅助材料解决吸湿问题，在未很好得到解决以前，暂时停止生产。我们感到已出厂的这宗药品，不必回收，但应设法向保管、使用单位说明，注意防潮、防止霉败。
