Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, December 29th: People who come to Fengman Hydropower Station always want to see the great dam that blocks the Songhua River. Now, standing on the top of the dam, one can fully appreciate the winter scenery of this large-scale power station.

From Fengman to Jilin, a distance of thirty to forty kilometers, is the only stretch of the 1,900-kilometer Songhua River that does not freeze. Every year from November to the end of March of the following year, the amount of water entering the Songhua Lake reservoir of Fengman Hydropower Station is less than the amount discharged, and the water level gradually drops. During this period, the hydropower station and thermal power plants cherish the water used for power generation as much as they cherish the coal used as fuel for power generation. Because six or seven tons of water can generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity.

The competition to save water for power generation officially began at the entire station in early December. Every day, the operations staff, based on the changes in the electricity consumption of the Northeast Extra-High Voltage Power Grid, put forward many rationalization proposals focusing on the rational allocation of unit loads. Their water-saving achievements are regularly announced on the competition board. In the first twenty-three days of December, this hydropower station has already saved 33 million tons of water for power generation, which can generate 5.32 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

    丰满水电站的冬天
    新华社吉林29日电　到丰满水电站来的人总要先看看拦断松花江的大堤坝。如今站在大堤坝的堤顶上，可以饱赏这座大型电站的冬季美景。
    从丰满到吉林三、四十公里，是一千九百公里的松花江仅有的一段不冻江。每年从十一月到第二年三月末，丰满水电站松花湖湖水进得少，出得多，水位渐渐下落。每逢这个时节，水电站和火电厂平时珍惜发电燃料——煤一样地珍惜发电用水。因为六、七吨水就能发一度电。
    节约发电用水的竞赛，12月初在全站正式展开。运行人员们每天根据东北超高压电力网用电情况的变化，围绕着机组负荷的合理分配，提出许多合理化建议。竞赛板上经常公布他们节水的成绩。12月份的前二十三天，这个水电站已经节省了发电用水三千三百万吨，可以发五百三十二万度电。
