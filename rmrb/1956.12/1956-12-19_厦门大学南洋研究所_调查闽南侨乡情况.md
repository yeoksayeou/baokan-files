    (Our newspaper reports) In order to understand the basic situation of overseas Chinese hometowns in Southern Fujian, the Nanyang Institute of Xiamen University organized a Southern Fujian overseas Chinese hometown visiting team for the first time. At the beginning of this month, they departed to Jinjiang County's Shiqi, Qingyang, Yakou, Jinkai, Dongshi, Nan'an County's Shijing, and Tong'an County to conduct investigations and visits. This visiting team is divided into three groups, which will systematically understand and investigate the history of overseas Chinese emigration from Southern Fujian, remittances from overseas Chinese, overseas Chinese school education, and cultural relics and historical sites in overseas Chinese hometowns.
    The national archaeology group conducted inspections of the famous historical site Gusao Pagoda in Shiqi and the Sui Dynasty architecture - Stone Buddha Temple in Dongshi District. They also discovered Neolithic stone tools, pottery, Tang and Song funerary objects, as well as Song Dynasty abandoned kiln and brick well ruins at the Shibi Reservoir construction site in Nan'an.
