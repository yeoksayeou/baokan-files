Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 2nd. The Tianjin 1956 Labor Competition Advanced Deeds Exhibition, which opened today, showcased 538 advanced deeds from more than 250 factories and enterprises.

The exhibition features an Advanced Experience Hall, a Quality Improvement Hall, and a New Products Hall. The exhibits include more than 3,700 items, such as various physical objects, models, and charts. The number of participating units in this year's exhibition has increased nearly twofold compared to last year, and the number of advanced deeds exhibited has more than doubled.

In the Advanced Experience Hall, cast iron pots made from iron filings and scrap iron attracted the interest of the audience. These cast iron pots have twice the lifespan of ordinary cast iron pots made from mined iron ore, are less prone to peeling, and are also cheaper. This product was successfully developed by the staff of the Tianjin Joint State-Private Cast Iron Pot Factory. The exhibits also included a white lime slag non-clinker cement made from oil felt factory's mineral slag mixed with lime and other raw materials. This cement can replace cement in preparing mortar for general bricklaying and plastering and low-grade concrete, and has the advantages of moisture resistance and frost resistance that ordinary cement does not have.

When visiting the Quality Exhibition Hall, the audience praised Tianjin's workers for their achievements in improving product quality. The Tianjin No. 2 Rubber Factory's automobile tires on display had their mileage increased from 30,000 kilometers last year to 40,000 kilometers this year.

The New Products Exhibition Hall was the most popular with the audience. The precision instrument—electronic oscilloscope—trial-produced by the Tianjin Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Factory, which can observe the activity and changes of current, is indispensable for telecommunications work and laboratories. Among the more than 230 new products on display in this hall, many have not been manufactured in our country before. Although some of these products have just been successfully trial-produced, their quality is already not far from that of similar imported products.

This exhibition is sponsored by the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions. During the exhibition period of one and a half months, the exhibition plans to organize various lectures and advanced experience exchange meetings according to the needs of the audience.

　　天津市举办劳动竞赛先进事迹展览会
    据新华社天津2日电　今天开幕的天津市1956年劳动竞赛先进事迹展览会上，展出了二百五十多个工厂企业单位的五百三十八项先进事迹。
    展览会设有先进经验馆、提高质量馆、新产品馆。展品有各种实物、模型、图表等三千七百多件。今年参加展览会的单位比去年增加将近两倍。展出的先进事迹比去年增加一倍以上。
    在先进经验馆展出的利用铁屑、废铁片等铸造的生铁锅，引起了观众们的兴趣。这种生铁锅比用矿铁铸成的普通生铁锅的寿命长一倍，而且不易脱皮，价格也比较便宜。这种产品是由天津市公私合营铸锅厂职工研究成功的。展品中还有一种利用油毡厂的矿碴掺合石灰等原料制成的白灰矿碴无熟料水泥。这种水泥可以代替水泥配制一般砌墙抹灰用的砂浆和低标号的混凝土，并且具有一般水泥所没有的抗潮性和抗冻性等优点。
    观众在参观质量展览馆展出的一百三十多种展品时，称赞了天津市职工在提高产品质量上的成就。会上展出的天津市第二橡胶厂的汽车外胎，它的行驶里程由去年的三万公里提高到今年的四万公里。
    新产品展览馆是最受观众欢迎的一个展览馆。这个馆展出的天津市电器制造厂试制成功的精密仪器——电子示波器，能够观察电流的活动和变化状况，是电讯工作和实验室所不可缺少的。这个馆中展出的二百三十多项新产品中，有许多是我国没有制造过的。其中有些产品，虽然刚刚试制成功，但是质量已经和进口的同类产品相差不远。
    这个展览会是由天津市工会联合会举办的。在展出的一个半月中，展览会准备根据观众的要求，组织各种不同内容的讲座和先进经验交流会等活动。
