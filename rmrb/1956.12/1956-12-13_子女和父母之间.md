The People's Daily cartoon "Dividing the Family" (November 27th) -- two brothers fighting over a fat pig; two sisters-in-law fighting over a wooden basin. Pushing their own mother around like a rubber ball. This phenomenon exists among farmers, and also among cadres. I also remember a short essay published in the People's Daily, satirizing a writer couple in Shenyang who tormented the elderly in every possible way in order to "save" expenses. Turning human relationships into naked monetary relationships, they spare no cruelty even to their own parents.

At the same time, there is another phenomenon: when children become "officials," their fathers immediately become "official masters," and their mothers immediately become "ladies of the house." It is already wrong for the people's "officials" to enjoy privileges; it is even more wrong for their family members, who have made no contributions to the revolution or to society, to enjoy privileges as well. We hope that things that shouldn't happen don't happen. But facts are always facts. At a cadre evening party, on the one hand, many cadres can't get tickets, and on the other hand, it is often found that the front row is occupied by old men and women who are neither cadres nor guests (evening parties specially organized for family members are another matter); many of the cars going to parks and theaters are carrying the "officials'" parents; in some hospitals, cadres with serious illnesses cannot get in, while so-called relatives with background, regardless of the severity of their illness, can enter freely; even more, after their parents die, they use public money to hold lavish banquets and large funerals, and the parents and children seem to be promoted together.

Parents raise their children to adulthood, ensuring that "the young are nurtured," is the responsibility of parents; children loving their parents, ensuring that "the old are cared for," is the responsibility of children. At the same time, parental love and filial piety are also human nature. We are against cruelty to our parents; we also despise the idea of enjoying privileges for ourselves and extending them to our parents and relatives. Let us build family happiness on the basis of communist morality! Let all the dirty things of capitalism and feudalism be buried together!

    子女和父母之间
    马铁丁
    人民日报漫画“分家”（11月27日）——一条肥猪，兄弟俩个争；一个木盆，妯娌俩个抢。把自己的母亲，像皮球似地推来推去。这种现象，在农民中间存在，在干部之中也是有的。我还记得人民日报登过一篇小品文，讽刺沈阳的一对作家夫妇，为了“节省”开支，对老年人百般折磨。把人与人之间的关系，化为赤裸裸的金钱关系，即使对自己的双亲残酷无情，也在所不惜。
    与此同时，还有另外一种现象：子女做“官”，父亲马上升为“官老爷”，母亲马上升为“太夫人”。人民之“官”，享有特权，已经是不应该的了；他的家属，虽然对革命无功绩，对社会无贡献，也跟着享有特权，那就尤其不应该。我们希望不应该的事，最好不存在。但是，事实总是事实。开一个干部晚会，一方面许多干部发不上票，另一方面，也经常发现，前排坐着既非干部亦非来宾的老公公老太太（专门为家属组织的晚会，另作别论）；到公园、戏院去的小汽车，有很多都是坐的“官”的爸妈；某些医院，病情严重的干部不得其门而入，而病情不论轻重的所谓有来历的家属反可以登堂入室；更有甚者：父母亲死了之后，拿公家的钱去大办筵席，大做丧事，父母与子女之间，很有点一同高升的味道。
    父母把自己的子女抚养成人，使“幼有所长”，是父母应尽的责任；子女敬爱自己的父母，使“老有所终”，是子女应尽的责任。同时，父慈子孝也是人的天性。对自己的父母残酷无情，是我们所反对的；由自己以至上自父母、旁及亲友一律享有特权，也为我们所不齿。让我们在共产主义的道德基础上建立天伦之乐吧！让那些资本主义的、封建主义的脏东西一齐被埋葬吧！
