    Many Problems in Hangzhou's Workers' Spare-Time Education
    Relevant Departments Are Studying Solutions

    (Our dispatch) Compared with the first half of the year, Hangzhou's workers' spare-time education has shown a state of decline in the second half of this year. The opening of various spare-time schools was generally delayed by one month to one and a half months, and the number of enrolled students also decreased significantly. According to statistics from ten large factories such as Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory, Hangzhou Cotton Textile Factory, and Fuhua Silk Factory, the number of literacy students enrolled in the first half of the year was more than 4,900, but in the second half of the year it was only more than 2,400, a decrease of half. The literacy enrollment rate in general factories is only about 40%. At present, the attendance rate of employees is also very low, with most factories only reaching 70%, and individual schools sometimes only reaching 10%.

    The reasons for the above problems, after consulting with the Industrial and Agricultural Education Section of the Hangzhou Education Bureau, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and full-time teachers of some spare-time schools, they believe that the first reason is that some leading organs do not pay enough attention to workers' spare-time education and the organizational leadership is unsound. Since the transfer of workers' spare-time education work from the trade union to administrative management, municipal-level industrial and commercial administrative departments have not established corresponding management institutions or assigned cadres for a long time. Although the administrations of most factories have taken over the spare-time schools, they have not effectively shouldered the leadership work. The propaganda departments of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League once relaxed their leadership over this work, and only recently reassigned cadres to be responsible. The basic-level trade unions in various factories have insufficient understanding of the principle of "administrative management, trade union assistance" for workers' spare-time schools, and have not cooperated well with the administration in carrying out work. Some trade union cadres even pushed it away and ignored it. The basic-level organizations of the Communist Youth League have also failed to cooperate with the administration in organizing and mobilizing, and the number of young workers and Communist Youth League members enrolled in the second half of the year has also decreased significantly.

    Secondly, the leaders of some factories have insufficient understanding of the guidelines and policies for workers' spare-time education. When they saw reports criticizing certain units for being impatient and rash in their literacy work, they became passive and conservative, and therefore delayed in formulating plans. Many factory leaders only emphasize production and central tasks, while neglecting workers' spare-time education.

    In addition, many factories had impatient and rash ideas in their literacy work in the first half of the year, resulting in coercive enrollment; this phenomenon was corrected in the second half of the year, but the number of enrolled students decreased accordingly. Many employees who could have enrolled were unwilling to enroll. Administrative leaders were afraid of repeating the mistake of coercive orders and did not dare to actively carry out mobilization work, which is also one of the reasons for the decrease in the number of enrolled employees.

    Now, these problems have attracted the attention of relevant departments and are being studied for solutions.

### 杭州职工业余教育中的问题很多  有关部门正在研究解决办法

    杭州职工业余教育中的问题很多
    有关部门正在研究解决办法
    本报讯　今年下半年杭州市的职工业余教育同上半年相比，呈现了退缩状态。各业余学校普遍延迟开学一个月到一个半月，入学人数也大大减少了。据浙江麻纺织厂、杭州棉纺织厂和福华丝绸厂等十个大厂的统计，上半年扫除文盲入学人数为四千九百多人，下半年只有二千四百多人，减少了一半。一般工厂文盲入学率只占40％左右。目前职工到课率也很低，大部分工厂只占70％，个别学校有时只有10％。
    产生以上问题的原因，经向杭州市教育局工农教育科、市工会联合会宣传部、团市委和部分业余学校专职教师了解，他们认为，首先是某些领导机关对职工业余教育工作重视不够，组织领导不健全。自从把职工业余教育工作由工会移交行政管理以后，市级工、商业行政部门长期不设立相应的管理机构，也不配备干部。大多数工厂的行政虽然接管了业余学校，也没有切实担负起领导工作。市工会和青年团市委的宣传部门，都曾一度放松对这一工作的领导，直到最近才重新配备干部负责。各厂基层工会对职工业余学校应贯彻“行政管理、工会协助”的原则认识不足，没有很好配合行政开展工作。某些工会干部甚至把它推出不管。团基层组织也没有配合行政进行组织动员，下半年青工、青年团员入学的人数也减少很多。
    其次，部分工厂的领导对职工业余教育的方针政策认识不足。他们看到报上批评某些单位扫除文盲工作急躁冒进，就消极保守起来，因而迟迟不订规划。许多工厂的负责人，只强调生产和中心任务，而忽视职工业余教育工作。
    此外，上半年不少工厂在扫除文盲工作中存在急躁冒进思想，因而有强迫命令入学的做法；下半年这种现象得到纠正，但是入学人数就相应减少了。有许多职工本来是可以入学的，也不愿意入学。行政领导怕再犯强迫命令的错误，不敢积极进行动员工作，这也是职工入学人数减少的原因之一。
    现在，这些问题已引起有关部门注意，正在研究解决。
