    Achievements of Soviet Economic Construction in 1956
    Jun Qiang, Zhang Ye
    This year is a year of great significance in the Soviet Union's struggle to build communism. In February, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union adopted the resolution on the directives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the development of the Soviet national economy. The Congress also proposed to complete a great and inspiring basic economic task of the Soviet Union, namely, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita industrial output in the shortest historical period. The realization of the grand program of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be an extremely important factor in completing this task. This year is the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and all sectors of the Soviet national economy have achieved remarkable successes.
    
    Great Achievements in Industrial Production
    This year, the Soviet people, in implementing the Leninist principle of developing the economy and the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, continued to focus their main efforts on the production of the means of production, while expanding the production of consumer goods on the basis of giving priority to the development of the means of production. The Soviet working people victoriously accomplished this task, enabling the Soviet Union's industrial production, especially the production of heavy industry, to achieve new and great successes this year. The entire annual plan for industrial products will be overfulfilled, and the output of industrial products will increase by about 11% compared with 1955, of which the production of means of production will increase by more than 11% and the production of consumer goods will increase by more than 9%. The speed of industrial development in the Soviet Union is incomparable to any capitalist country. For example, the Soviet Union's steel production this year will increase tenfold compared with 1929, while the United States' steel production increased only 1.8 times during this period; the Soviet Union's oil increased sixfold during this period, while the United States' oil production increased only 2.5 times.
    
    This year, the Soviet Union not only greatly increased its industrial products, but also achieved considerable success in the technological progress of industry.
    
    In the first eleven months of this year, the Soviet Union's steel production was 10% more than the total output of 1955. For example, in November alone, 17,000 tons of high-quality alloy steel were produced above the plan. These achievements are inseparable from the improvement of production technology in the metallurgical industry. More than 93% of the steel in the Soviet Union is produced in automated open-hearth furnaces. Many open-hearth furnaces have adopted chrome-magnesite bricks as furnace roofs, thereby extending the service life of steelmaking furnaces. In addition, advanced oxygen blowing methods have been widely adopted. This year, the Soviet Union's steel output increased by 10% compared with last year. This achievement in steel rolling is largely due to the increased production efficiency of rolling mills.
    
    Coal production has also increased significantly this year. Taking the famous coal-producing area of Donbass as an example, the daily coal production has increased by 30,000 tons compared with last year. Coal mining enterprises have obtained many new-style machines this year and improved their technical equipment. For example, the transportation of coal and rock is almost entirely mechanized. In the second half of this year, the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union took some other measures to improve the coal mining industry, such as providing a large number of manpower to support coal mining enterprises, and adopting new labor organization and wage systems. These measures and equipment improvements have produced good results. From September 1st to November this year, the Soviet Union mined 10 million tons more coal than in the same period last year. Such a high production record is the first in the history of the Soviet coal mining industry.
    
    This year, if it were not for the shortcomings in the national economic plan and economic leadership, which resulted in the failure to complete the annual plan, more steel and coal would have been produced.
    
    The oil industry has also achieved great success. By mid-December, oil extraction had increased by 12.5 million tons compared with last year. This amount is equal to one to nine times the average annual oil production in the previous five-year plans. The adoption of modern advanced technologies, such as maintaining oil layer pressure and secondary oil recovery using edge water displacement methods, has greatly promoted the increase in oil production.
    
    The Soviet Union's achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy are well known. The world's first atomic power station has been working smoothly for more than two years. The Soviet Union will build five major atomic power stations with a generating capacity of 400,000 to 600,000 kilowatts each from 1956 to 1960. Preparations are currently underway for the construction of these new atomic power stations. This year, the first icebreaker with an atomic engine is nearing completion.
    
    This year, the production of Soviet light industry enterprises has also greatly increased. This year, light industry supplied residents with products exceeding the plan by 3 billion rubles; the food industry's supply exceeded the plan by 4 billion rubles. Among them, the enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule on December 26th, producing a total of 10 billion rubles more industrial products than last year. The production of high-quality products has increased particularly significantly. For example, silk fabrics increased by 230 million meters compared with last year, linen fabrics increased by 75 million meters, and shoes increased by 16.5 million pairs. The variety of clothing has also increased. For example, 800 new styles of shoes were produced this year. The production of cultural goods and daily necessities has also increased significantly.
    
    New Huge Construction Projects
    
    This year is the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and many large projects have been started one after another according to the plan.
    
    The Soviet Union has made great achievements in building power stations this year. The electricity produced by the Soviet Union this year will reach more than 190 billion kilowatt-hours. The total generating capacity of power station generating units put into operation this year exceeds six times the generating capacity of the Dneprostroi Hydroelectric Station, the largest in Europe before the Patriotic War.
    
    There are currently more than 400 thermal power stations and hydroelectric power stations under construction. Many of these hydroelectric power stations are very large in scale. The generating capacity of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station on the Angara River has been increased from 3.2 million kilowatts to 3.6 million kilowatts. Preparations at the construction site of this huge project are nearing completion. The Krasnoyarsk Hydroelectric Station on the Yenisei River, originally planned with a generating capacity of 3.2 million kilowatts, has been planned to increase its generating capacity to 4 million kilowatts, and the construction of this hydroelectric station has also begun. In addition, the design work for a larger Yenisei Hydroelectric Station, with a generating capacity of 5 million kilowatts, was completed this year. This is an unprecedentedly huge hydroelectric station in the world.
    
    The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station on the Volga River completed the annual plan ahead of schedule. A total of eleven giant generators have been installed this year and have all generated electricity. The Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station blocked the Ob River in mid-November. The Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station, the first hydroelectric station on the Angara River, will begin generating electricity at the end of this year.
    
    The Karaganda Iron and Steel Plant, one of the four giant steel plants planned to be newly built in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, has begun construction on the grasslands of central Kazakhstan. The Sokolovsk-Sarbay Mining and Processing Combine, located in northwestern Kazakhstan and whose construction has begun, is one of the key projects of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. The iron ore reserves in these two places are greater than those in the Urals. This mining and processing combine will be the largest in Europe.
    
    Many other huge capital construction projects in the Sixth Five-Year Plan are also proceeding successfully. Construction projects are countless. In the first half of this year alone, the Soviet Union built, renovated and expanded more than 3,500 industrial enterprises.
    
    Overall Upsurge in Agricultural Production
    
    In 1956, the Soviet Union not only achieved great success in industrial production, but also achieved an overall upsurge in agricultural production, and the output of many crops achieved the highest output in Soviet history.
    
    This year, the Soviet Union's grain production has been particularly remarkable, with harvests breaking the highest record in Soviet history. The amount of marketable grain obtained by the state is also the highest in history. As of November 5, the country had purchased 3.281 billion poods of grain (each pood equals 32.76 market catties), and a total of 3.463 billion poods including other agricultural products, which is more than 1 billion poods more than in previous bumper years.
    
    The outstanding achievements in Soviet grain production and grain procurement are of great national economic significance: now, the Soviet Union has been able to meet the basic needs of residents for grain and superior grain (the grain supply to the Soviet Union's national residents is about 2 billion poods).
    
    The huge victory on the Soviet grain production front this year is the result of the Soviet people's implementation of a series of measures to actively develop agricultural production formulated by the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union in the past two or three years. Among these measures, the decisive role is the grand plan to reclaim 28 million to 30 million hectares of virgin and fallow land in Kazakhstan, Siberia and the Urals. In more than two years, 35.5 million hectares of wasteland have actually been reclaimed, which is almost equal to 1.7 times the total area of grain crops in the United Kingdom, Italy and France combined. Such large-scale land reclamation has increased the sown area of Soviet crops this year by 37 million hectares compared with three years ago, which is almost three times the sown area increased by the United States in the forty years from 1910 to 1950. As a result, grain production has increased unprecedentedly. For example, the Republic of Kazakhstan, which has always been lagging behind in grain production, has delivered a total of 1.0034 billion poods to the state this year as a result of large-scale land reclamation, exceeding the total amount of grain it provided to the state in the eleven years before large-scale land reclamation. In the Russian Federation, large-scale land reclamation has also increased its marketable grain by 580 million poods compared with last year.
    
    The development of grain production has promoted the upsurge of animal husbandry, and in particular, significant achievements have been made in improving the productivity of livestock products. Compared with the previous livestock year, the total milk production of Soviet collective farms increased by 4.115 million tons, an increase of 32%, and the milk delivered and sold to the state increased by nearly 3 million tons. Pork production increased even faster, and the number of pigs raised by collective farms doubled compared with the past year.
    
    This year, the Soviet Union's cotton production is also the highest in Soviet history, and it is estimated to exceed four to five times the highest total cotton production in Russia before the October Revolution. Uzbekistan, the Soviet Union's main cotton-producing area, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. On 1.3 million hectares of cotton fields, each hectare of land produced an average of 22 quintals of raw cotton, and the yield per unit area increased by an average of 3 quintals compared with last year. Due to the bumper cotton harvest, Uzbekistan delivered 2.835 million tons of raw cotton to the state, 440,000 tons more than in the same period last year, greatly exceeding the total raw cotton production of the entire Soviet Union in 1940.
    
    This year, the Soviet Union's sugar beet harvest also exceeded the highest yield in Soviet history in 1955. As of November 15, the collective farms alone supplied sugar beets to sugar factories 50 million quintals more than in the same period last year, which allowed factories to produce 50 million poods more sugar. Soviet regions also had good harvests of flax, vegetables, potatoes and other crops. Collective farms have made new achievements in developing sericulture, and the silkworm cocoons supplied to textile industry enterprises this year have exceeded 28,000 tons, an increase of nearly 4,000 tons compared with last year.
    
    The tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union in industrial production and the overall upsurge in agricultural production this year undeniably demonstrate the incomparable superiority of the socialist system. Now, the Soviet Union has taken a new step forward on the road to building the material and technical basis of communism. At the same time, it also makes it possible for the Soviet government to continuously improve the material well-being and cultural living standards of the working people on the basis of developing the socialist economy and improving labor productivity, and has taken a series of measures to improve people's lives. Today, the Soviet people have begun to eat better, dress better, and have a richer cultural life.

    1956年苏联经济建设的成就
    君强　章叶
    在苏联建设共产主义的斗争中，今年是意义重大的一年。2月，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会通过了关于苏联发展国民经济的第六个五年计划的指示的决议。代表大会还提出完成苏联的一项伟大而令人鼓舞的基本经济任务，即要在最短的历史时期内在按人口计算的工业产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。实现第六个五年计划的宏伟纲领，将是完成这项任务的一个极其重要的因素。今年是第六个五年计划的第一年，苏联国民经济各部门都获得了显著的成就。
    工业生产的巨大成就
    今年苏联人民执行列宁主义的发展经济的原则和苏共第二十次代表大会的决议，仍然把主要力量放在生产资料的生产上，同时在生产资料优先发展的基础上扩大消费品的生产。苏联劳动人民胜利地实现了这项任务，使今年苏联的工业生产、首先是重工业的生产获得了新的巨大成就。工业品的整个年度计划将超额完成，工业品产量将比1955年增加约11％，其中生产资料的生产增加11％以上，消费品生产增加9％以上。苏联工业发展的速度是任何资本主义国家无法比拟的。例如，苏联今年的钢产量将增加为1929年的十倍，而美国钢产量在这段期间仅增为一点八倍；苏联的石油在这段期间增为六倍，而美国的石油产量仅增为二点五倍。
    今年苏联不仅工业产品大大增加了，而且在工业的技术进步方面也获得了不少成就。
    今年头十一个月中苏联的钢产量比1955年全年产量还多10％。例如，单在11月份就超计划生产了高质合金钢一万七千吨。这些成就是同在冶金工业中生产技术的改进分不开的。苏联93％以上的钢都是用自动化平炉炼出的。许多平炉都采用了铬镁砖做炉顶，从而延长了炼钢炉的使用期限。此外还广泛采用了先进的氧气鼓风法。今年苏联钢材产量比去年增加了10％。轧钢方面的这一成就在很大程度上是由于提高了轧钢机的生产效率而取得的。
    今年的煤炭产量也有很大增加。以著名的煤产地顿巴斯来说，每昼夜的产煤量就比去年增加了三万吨。煤矿企业今年获得了许多新式机器，改善了技术设备。例如，煤和岩石的运输工作几乎全部机械化了。今年下半年，苏联共产党和政府采取了一些其他措施来提高采煤业，如以大批人力去支援煤矿企业，采用新的劳动组织和工资制度等。这些措施和设备的改善都产生了良好的效果。从今年9月1日到11月两个多月的时间内苏联所开采的煤比去年同期多一千万吨。这样高的生产纪录在苏联采煤工业史上还是第一次。
    今年，如果不是由于国民经济计划和经济领导工作中存在着缺点，使年度计划没有完成的话，那么，还会生产更多的钢和煤。
    石油工业也获得了巨大成就。到12月中旬，石油的开采量已经比去年增加了一千二百五十万吨。这个数目等于前几个五年计划中每年石油平均产量的一倍到九倍。由于采用了近代先进技术，如保持油层压力和用边水排油的方法进行二次采油等先进方法，大大促进了采油量的提高。
    苏联在和平利用原子能方面的成就是众所周知的。世界上第一个原子能发电站已经顺利地工作了两年多。苏联在1956年到1960年还要建立发电能力各为四十万瓩到六十万瓩的五大原子能发电站。目前正在从事建立这些新的原子能发电站的准备工作。今年，第一艘原子能发动机的破冰船已经快要造好了。
    今年苏联轻工业企业的生产也大大增加了。今年轻工业供给居民的产品超过计划三十亿卢布；食品工业的供应超过计划四十亿卢布。其中轻工业部所属各企业在12月26日已提前完成了今年的生产计划，总共比去年多生产了价值一百亿卢布的工业品。高等质量的产品增加得特别多。例如，丝织品比去年增加了二亿三千万公尺，麻织品增加了七千五百万公尺，鞋增加了一千六百五十万双。各种衣物的品种也增加了，例如今年生产了八百种新式样的鞋。文化用品和生活日用品的生产量也增加了很多。
    新的巨大建设工程
    今年是第六个五年计划的第一年，许多大工程都按计划次第动工兴建了。
    苏联今年在建设发电站方面有很大成就。今年苏联生产的电力将达到一千九百亿度以上。今年投入生产的电力站联动机的总发电能力超过了卫国战争前欧洲最大的第聂伯水电站发电能力的六倍。
    目前正在建设着的热电站和水电站共有四百多个。其中许多水电站的规模都是非常庞大的。安加拉河上的布拉次克水电站的发电能力已经由三百二十万瓩提高到三百六十万瓩。在这个巨大工程的工地上准备工作已接近完成。原定发电能力为三百二十万瓩的叶尼塞河上的克拉斯诺雅尔斯克水电站，已计划把发电能力提高到四百万瓩，这个水电站的建筑工作也开始了。此外，今年还完成了一个更大的叶尼塞水电站的设计工作，它的发电能力将为五百万瓩，这是世界上空前巨大的水电站。
    伏尔加河上的古比雪夫水电站提前完成了年度计划。今年共安装好了十一部巨型发电机，并且都已经发电。新西伯利亚水电站已在11月中旬拦断了鄂毕河。安加拉河上第一个水电站——伊尔库次克水电站今年年底即要开始发电了。
    第六个五年计划中预计新建的四个巨大钢铁厂之一卡拉干达钢铁厂，已在哈萨克共和国中部的草原上开始兴建。开始建设的位于哈萨克共和国西北部的索科洛夫斯克—萨尔巴依联合选矿厂，是第六个五年计划的重点工程之一。这两个地方的铁矿蕴藏量比乌拉尔还多。这个选矿厂将是欧洲最大的选矿厂。
    第六个五年计划中其他许多巨大的基本建设工程也都在成功地进行着。建设工程是数不胜数的。仅今年上半年，苏联建成、改建和扩建的工业企业就有三千五百多个。
    农业生产的全面高涨
    1956年的苏联不仅在工业生产上获得了巨大的成就，而且在农业生产上也获得了全面高涨，许多农作物的产量都获得了苏联历史上的最高产量。
    今年苏联谷物生产的成绩特别显著，收获量打破了苏联历史上的最高纪录，国家所得到的商品谷物也是历史上最多的一年，到11月5日止，全国已经采购谷物三十二亿八千一百万普特（每普特合三二点七六市斤），把其他农产品也算进去一共有三十四亿六千三百万普特，比过去丰收的年头还要多十亿多普特。
    苏联谷物大丰收和粮食采购方面的突出成就是具有重大国民经济意义的：现在，苏联已经能够满足居民对于谷物以及优等谷物的基本需要了（供应苏联全国居民的粮食大约只要二十亿普特）。
    今年苏联谷物生产战线上的巨大胜利是最近两、三年来苏联人民实现苏联共产党和苏联政府制定的一系列积极发展农业生产措施的结果。在这些措施中起决定性作用的是在哈萨克、西伯利亚和乌拉尔等地开垦两千八百万到三千万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地的宏伟计划。在两年多的时间里，实际上开垦了三千五百五十万公顷的荒地，这个数目几乎等于英国、意大利和法国粮食作物种植面积总和的一点七倍。这样大规模开垦荒地，使今年苏联农作物的播种面积比三年前扩大了三千七百万公顷，这几乎等于美国在1910到1950年四十年间增加的播种面积的三倍。结果，谷物产量空前地增加了。例如，谷物生产一向落后的哈萨克共和国，由于大规模开垦荒地的结果，今年向国家总共交售了十亿零三十四万普特，超过了它在大规模开垦荒地以前十一年间提供给国家的谷物的总和。在俄罗斯联邦，由于大规模开垦荒地也使得它的商品谷物比去年增加五亿八千万普特。
    谷物生产的发展促进了畜牧业的高涨，特别是在提高牲畜产品生产率方面获得了显著的成就。同上一个畜牧业年度比较，苏联集体农庄的牛奶总产量增加了四百一十一万五千吨，即增加了32％，交售和出售给国家的牛奶增加了将近三百万吨。猪肉产量增加得更快，集体农庄养猪的数量比过去的一年增加一倍。
    今年苏联的棉花产量也是苏联历史上最高的一年，据估计将超过十月革命前俄国棉花最高总产量的四倍到五倍。苏联主要产棉区的乌兹别克获得了空前未有的大丰收。在一百三十万公顷的棉田上，每公顷土地平均出产了二十二公担的原棉，单位面积产量比去年平均增加了三公担。由于棉花大丰收，乌兹别克向国家交售了二百八十三万五千吨原棉，比去年同期的交售量多四十四万吨，大大超过了1940年全苏联的原棉总产量。
    今年苏联甜菜的收获量也超过了苏联历史上最高的1955年的产量。到11月15日止，单是集体农庄提供给制糖厂的甜菜就比去年同期增加了五千万公担，这使得工厂可以多生产五千万普特的糖。苏联各地的亚麻、蔬菜、马铃薯等农作物也获得了很好的收成。集体农庄在发展养蚕业方面获得了新的成就，今年供给纺织工业企业的蚕茧已经有两万八千吨以上，比去年增加了将近四千吨。
    今年苏联在工业生产上的巨大成就和在农业生产上的全面高涨，无可争辩地表明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。现在，苏联在建设共产主义物质技术基础的道路上向前迈进了新的一步。同时，也使得苏联政府有可能在发展社会主义经济和提高劳动生产率的基础上，不断提高劳动人民的物质福利和文化生活水平，并且采取了一系列改善人民生活的措施。今天，苏联人民已经开始吃得更好，穿得更好，文化生活也更丰富了。
