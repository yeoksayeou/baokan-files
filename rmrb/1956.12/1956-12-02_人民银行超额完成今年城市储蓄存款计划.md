Xinhua News Agency, 1st. By November 20th, the People's Bank of China's new urban savings deposits this year had reached 527 million yuan, exceeding the annual plan by 5.51%. If this money were used to build railways, it could build more than 1,170 kilometers; if it were used to build textile factories with 90,000 spindles, it could build fourteen.

Since the implementation of wage reform in the third quarter of this year, workers in various regions have actively participated in savings. According to preliminary statistics from the twenty-seven provincial and municipal branches of the People's Bank, the number of depositors in the third quarter increased by more than 1.8 million compared to the second quarter. This is the main reason why the savings deposit plan for this year was overfulfilled ahead of schedule.

　　人民银行超额完成今年城市储蓄存款计划
    新华社1日讯　截至11月20日为止，今年中国人民银行新增加的城市储蓄存款数已经达到五亿二千七百多万元，超过全年计划5.51％。这笔钱如果用来修筑铁路，可以修一千一百七十多公里；如果用来建设九万纱锭的纺织厂，可以建十四个。
    今年第三季度实行工资改革以后，各地职工都踊跃参加储蓄。据人民银行二十七个省市分行的初步统计，第三季度存款户数比第二季度存款户数增加了一百八十多万户。这是今年储蓄存款计划提前超额完成的主要原因。
