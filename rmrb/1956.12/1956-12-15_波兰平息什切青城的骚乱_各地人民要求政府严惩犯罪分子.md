Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 14th: Laboring people in Szczecin and other cities in Poland have been gathering in recent days to firmly protest the rampant thugs who recently created riots in Szczecin, western Poland, and engaged in provocative acts in front of the Soviet Consulate.

On the evening of December 10th, a group of thugs in Szczecin beat a police officer who was escorting a drunkard. Soon, more and more thugs gathered, blocking a street, preventing trams from running, and attempting to attack the court and prison. The police immediately came to stop them, but the thugs failed to achieve their goal and only broke the windows of the court. Two hours later, the thugs attacked the Soviet Consulate again, attacking the police and breaking the windows of the Soviet Consulate. The thugs raised reactionary slogans, attempting to incite demonstrations. Under the call of the local Party committee, workers, students, and garrison troops assisted the police in quelling the incident and arresting the main instigators of the riot.

On the 11th, a group of thugs again attempted to disrupt public order in the city. The police took resolute action and quickly dispersed them.

After the incident, the people of Szczecin angrily condemned the provocations of the adventurers. Factories and schools throughout the city spontaneously held meetings, demanding that the government resolutely stop such provocative acts and severely punish the criminals involved in the provocative incident. People also unanimously demanded strengthening the work of the police. According to the resolutions of many meetings, the city headquarters of the worker-student guard, assisting the police in maintaining order in the city, was established on the 12th.

Currently, the procuratorial organs are interrogating the ninety-one thugs arrested in the incident. Preliminary investigations have revealed that some of the ringleaders of the incident were former criminals who had been granted amnesty.

On December 11th, Wilna, director of the General Office of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Bartol, director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, expressed their apologies to Soviet Ambassador to Poland Ponomarenko regarding the attack on the Soviet Consulate and prepared to compensate the consulate for the material losses it suffered.
