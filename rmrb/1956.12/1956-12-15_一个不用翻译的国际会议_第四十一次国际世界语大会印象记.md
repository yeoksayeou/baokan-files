    An International Conference Without Translation
    Impressions of the Forty-First International Esperanto Congress
    Zhang Qicheng
    This August, in Copenhagen, the Danish capital, often called the "Paris of the North," an international conference with more than two thousand participants was held. Although the participants came from more than forty countries, no translators were provided in the meeting rooms, nor was simultaneous interpretation equipment installed. People spoke the same language, so they could speak and listen freely, and they could also chat freely in the corridors of the venue, as if they were all in their own countries.
    This international conference that eliminated language barriers was the International Esperanto Congress, where everyone spoke Esperanto. Since 1905, the International Esperanto Congress has been held annually (interrupted only twice during the two world wars), and this year was the forty-first. The All-China Esperanto League, upon the invitation of the Congress Organizing Committee, sent representatives to attend this congress for the first time this year.
    The International Esperanto Congress is an international conference mainly aimed at fostering friendship and promoting Esperanto. It itself often does not discuss any major issues or make any important resolutions. However, it provides an opportunity for Esperantists from various countries to gather together, and various international Esperanto professional organizations and national Esperanto delegations or individuals can use this opportunity to carry out various activities.
    There are various international organizations for Esperanto, the most important of which is the Universal Esperanto Association (UEA), which aims to promote Esperanto and has more than 20,000 members in eighty-one countries around the world. In addition, important organizations include: the International Association of Esperanto-Speaking Scientists, the International Association of Esperanto Teachers, the International Association of Esperanto Journalists, the International Railway Workers' Esperanto Federation, the International Christian Esperanto Association, the International Catholic Esperanto Union, the International Philatelic Association, the International Geographical Society, the Social Democratic Group, the War Resisters' International (an organization of pacifists), and the "World Peace Esperanto Movement," etc. These organizations also held separate meetings during the congress to discuss various issues related to them. In addition to these, the 26th International Esperanto Congress for the Blind (with more than 130 Esperantists from thirteen countries participating) and the first International Children's Congress (with thirty-five child Esperantists from ten countries participating) were also held during the congress. The annual "International Summer University" was also held as usual during this congress, with ten academic papers of various content read in Esperanto. During the congress, a conference of Esperanto writers and an award ceremony for Esperanto literary creation and translation competitions were also held. As for the congress's entertainment activities, there were theatrical performances (three one-act plays by contemporary Danish writers were performed in Esperanto), group trips, and dance parties. The content of the congress was very rich and varied, and all kinds of Esperantists could find opportunities to participate in activities they liked. As for personal contact outside the conference, it was even more frequent. Because they spoke the same language, everyone could talk to anyone at will and make friends.
    This year's International Esperanto Congress also had a major feature, which was that many socialist countries participated in the congress, which was a phenomenon that had not occurred in the past. The socialist countries that participated in this congress, in addition to our country, included Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Bulgaria (the Soviet Union had already registered two people to participate, but they did not arrive due to some reason). The attendance of Esperantists from socialist countries was highly valued and warmly welcomed by the congress, because it not only marked the peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems, but also symbolized the great unity of Esperantists around the world, thus creating extremely favorable conditions for the further development of Esperanto.
    The Universal Esperanto Association is the central organization of the international Esperanto movement. Although this organization has always claimed neutrality, it has held prejudices against socialist countries in the past. However, in the past year, due to the easing of the international situation and the development of international peace and neutrality trends, the attitude of the Universal Esperanto Association has also changed accordingly. It now adopts a truly neutral attitude, and equally welcomes Esperanto groups and individuals from socialist countries to cooperate with it, so that it can become a universal international Esperanto organization. That is to say, it has affirmed the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different systems in the international Esperanto movement, in order to develop the Esperanto movement on the basis of this principle. This attitude of sincere cooperation with all countries in the world regardless of social system has won the warm support of the vast majority of Esperantists around the world, because it is clear that the opposite approach is also very unfavorable to the Esperanto movement itself. This neutral attitude of the Universal Esperanto Association was also supported by the vast majority of directors in this council meeting. In order to adhere to the principle of neutrality, the board of directors passed a resolution to expel the American director Connor, who firmly opposed the principle of neutrality and maliciously slandered the Universal Esperanto Association, and the North American Esperanto Association he led (another American Esperanto group is still a member of the association), which had fascist tendencies. At the same time, the board of directors approved in principle the admission of Esperanto organizations from Hungary and Bulgaria as its group members. The Universal Esperanto Association's adoption of this neutral principle is not only beneficial to the international Esperanto movement, but also helps mutual understanding and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, which is worthy of our welcome.
    During the congress and on the way to the congress, we had several conversations with Esperanto comrades from fraternal countries and the Soviet Union. From these contacts, we were pleased to learn that the Esperanto movement in these countries is redeveloping to varying degrees. Esperantists in the Soviet Union are now promoting Esperanto among young people, on the one hand to cultivate a new generation of Esperanto speakers (Moscow University and other universities have Esperanto groups), and on the other hand to prepare for the 6th International Youth Festival to be held in Moscow next year. (At the last International Youth Festival held in Warsaw, more than two hundred young Esperantists participating in the festival held their own gathering. The effect of this gathering was very good, and it was considered the most successful of all the gatherings. Young people from various countries increased their mutual understanding and friendship through the medium of Esperanto. Therefore, it is expected that Esperanto will be more widely used at next year's festival.) The Esperanto movement in Poland can be said to have been quite widely developed. Taking the publication of books and periodicals as an example, it has published Esperanto versions of the famous work "Pan Tadeusz" by the great Polish poet Mickiewicz and a biography of Mickiewicz, and will soon publish the Esperanto translation of Prus's famous work "Pharaoh," and the large-scale pictorial "Poland" has also added an Esperanto version since July of this year. The Esperanto movement in Yugoslavia has always been very developed, and more than one hundred Yugoslav Esperantists participated in this congress. In Hungary, the Esperanto movement is also experiencing a resurgence. The Hungarian delegation held a "Hungarian Morning" at this congress, and in addition to giving a report on the cultural situation in Hungary, they also showed two documentaries dubbed in Esperanto, which aroused great interest among the attendees. As for Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, the Esperanto movements in both countries were originally quite developed, and are now becoming active again.
    During our attendance at this congress, we made extensive contact with Esperantists from various countries. Most of these Esperantists, apart from a few scholars and celebrities, were kind ordinary people. Many of them were very interested in our ancient and newborn country, and generally speaking, they had a certain degree of goodwill. Therefore, they were happy to talk to us and ask us about the situation in China that they wanted to know. As for the people who asked us to sign autographs or exchange contact addresses, there were countless, and we were simply overwhelmed. At the congress, we also met many readers of Chinese Esperanto publications (the "China Guide" published during the Anti-Japanese War, "Voice of the Orient," and the "People's China Report" published after liberation, etc.). They were all old friends of China, so we hit it off immediately and were very happy.
    After participating in this congress, I deeply felt that although Esperanto has not yet become a common international language, in its development of nearly seventy years, it has proved with vivid facts that it is an international language that can be applied to all aspects, and it is a living language rather than a paper plan. It can play a certain role in enhancing the friendship of the people of all countries and strengthening international cultural exchange.
    Another point I have also realized is that, with the help of Esperanto, we can have more extensive and direct contact with ordinary people in various countries; from this relatively in-depth contact, we can learn more about them, and at the same time, we can help them learn more about us. And this mutual understanding is undoubtedly a necessary foundation for us to build friendship with them.

    一个不用翻译的国际会议
    第四十一次国际世界语大会印象记
    张企程
    今年8月，在素有“北欧的巴黎”之称的丹麦首都哥本哈根，举行了一次有两千多人参加的国际会议。虽然参加会议的人来自四十多个国家，人们却并没有在会场中配备翻译人员，也没有安装同声传译的设备。人们操着同一种语言，因此可以自由自在地发言和听讲，也可以同样自由自在地在会场走廊中随便交谈，好像他们都在自己的国家里一样。
    排除了语言障碍的这个国际会议，就是到会的人都讲世界语（Esperanto）的国际世界语大会。自从1905年以来，国际世界语大会每年举行一次（只有在两次世界大战期间有过两度中断），今年举行的是第四十一次。我们中华全国世界语协会应大会筹备委员会的邀请，今年第一次派代表出席了这个大会。
    国际世界语大会是以联络感情和宣传世界语为主要目的的国际会议，它本身往往并不讨论什么重大的问题，也不作出什么重要的决议。可是它提供一个使各国世界语者可以齐集一堂的机会，而各种国际性的世界语专业组织和各国世界语代表团或个人，则可以利用这个机会进行各种方式的活动。
    世界语有各种国际组织，其中最主要的是以推广世界语为目的的国际世界语会（UEA），在全世界八十一国中拥有二万多会员。此外，重要的组织有：国际世界语者科学家协会，国际世界语者教师协会，国际世界语者记者协会，国际世界语者铁路职工联盟，国际基督教世界语者协会，国际天主教世界语者同盟，国际集邮协会，国际地理学会，社会民主党小组，反战国际（和平主义者的组织）和“世界和平世界语运动”等等。这些组织也都在这次大会期间分头举行会议，讨论同它们有关的各项问题。除了这些以外，在大会期间还举行了有十三个国家一百三十多人参加的第二十六次国际盲人世界语者大会和第一次国际儿童小会（有十个国家的三十五个儿童世界语者参加）。一年一次的“国际暑期大学”在这次大会期间也照例举行，用世界语宣读了十篇各种内容的学术论文。大会期间，还举行了世界语作家会议和世界语文艺创作及翻译竞赛的评奖。作为大会文娱活动则有演剧晚会（用世界语演出了三个当代丹麦作家的独幕剧），集体旅行和跳舞晚会。大会的内容是十分丰富而多采的，各种各样的世界语者都可以找到机会参加他们所喜爱的活动。至于会外的个人接触更是十分频繁。由于彼此语言相通，每一个人都可以随意找人谈话，结识朋友。
    今年这次国际世界语大会，还有一个最大的特色，那就是许多社会主义国家参加了这次大会，这是过去所没有的现象。参加这次大会的社会主义国家，除我国以外，还有波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫、匈牙利和保加利亚（苏联本已有二人报名参加，后因故未到）。社会主义国家世界语者的出席受到了大会的十分重视和热烈欢迎，因为这不仅标志着不同制度的国家的和平共处，而且也象征着全世界世界语者的大团结，从而为世界语的进一步发展创造了极为有利的条件。
    国际世界语会是国际世界语运动的中心组织。这个组织虽然一向标榜中立，过去一直对社会主义国家抱有成见。但是近一年来，由于国际局势的缓和以及国际间和平中立倾向的发展，国际世界语会的态度也有了相应的转变。它现在采取了真正中立的态度，同样欢迎社会主义国家的世界语团体和个人同它合作，使它自己成为具有普遍性的国际世界语组织。也就是说，它在国际世界语运动中肯定了不同制度的国家和平共处的原则，以期在这个原则的基础上来发展世界语运动。这种不问社会制度而同世界各国真诚合作的态度，博得了全世界绝大多数世界语者的热烈拥护，因为很明显，与此相反的做法对世界语运动本身也是十分不利的。国际世界语会的这种中立态度，也在这次理事会中得到了绝大多数理事的支持。为了坚持中立原则，理事会通过决议，开除了坚决反对中立原则并对国际世界语会进行恶毒诽谤的美国理事康纳及其所领导的具有法西斯倾向的北美世界语会（美国另一个世界语团体则仍为该会会员）。理事会同时原则通过吸收匈牙利和保加利亚的世界语组织为它的团体会员。国际世界语会采取这种中立原则，不仅有利于国际世界语运动，而且也有助于各国人民之间的相互了解和友好合作，是值得我们欢迎的。
    在大会期间和赴会途中，我们同到会的兄弟国家和苏联的一些世界语同志作了多次交谈。从这些接触中，我们欣幸地了解到，这些国家的世界语运动都在不同程度上重新发展起来。苏联的世界语者现在正在青年中推广世界语，一方面是为了培养世界语的新生一代（莫斯科大学等都有世界语小组），另一方面是为了明年将在莫斯科举行的第六届国际青年联欢节作好准备。（上届在华沙举行国际青年联欢节时，有二百多个参加联欢节的青年世界语者举行了自己的集会，这次集会效果很好，被认为是各种集会中最成功的一次，到会的各国青年通过世界语这一媒介增进了彼此的了解和友谊。因此预期在明年的联欢节上，世界语将得到更广泛的应用。）波兰的世界语运动可以说已经相当广泛地展开，就拿出版书刊这一点来说，它已经出版了波兰大诗人密茨凯维支的名著“塔杜施先生”和密茨凯维支传记的世界语版，不久还将出版普鲁斯的名著“法老王”的世界语译本，而且大型画报“波兰”也从今年7月起增出了世界语版。南斯拉夫的世界语运动一向很发达，参加这次大会的南斯拉夫世界语者有一百多人。在匈牙利，世界语运动也在再度兴盛起来。匈牙利的代表团在这次大会中举行了一次“匈牙利晨会”，除了在会上作了关于匈牙利文化情况的报告以外，还放映了两张用世界语配音的纪录片，引起了到会者的很大兴趣。至于捷克斯洛伐克和保加利亚，两国的世界语运动本来都是相当发展的，现在也都在重新活跃起来了。
    出席这次大会的期间，我们同各国的世界语者作了广泛的接触。这些世界语者，除了少数的学者名流以外，大多数是善良的普通人。他们之中很多人对于我们这古老而新生的国家有很大的兴趣，而且一般说来都怀有一定的好感。因此他们都乐于和我们交谈，向我们了解他们所要知道的中国情况。至于要求我们签名留念或交换通讯地址的人，更是不计其数，简直使我们应接不暇。在大会上，我们还遇见不少中国世界语刊物（抗战时期出版的“中国导报”，“东方呼声”以及解放以后出版的“人民中国报道”等等）的读者，他们都是中国的老朋友，因此同我们一见如故，十分愉快。
    参加了这次大会以后，我深深感觉到，世界语虽然在目前还没有成为一种通行的国际语，但是在它将近七十年来的发展过程中，它已经用活生生的事实证明它是一种可以被应用于各方面的国际语，它是一种活的语言而不是一种纸面上的方案。它在增进各国人民的友好和加强国际文化交流这两点上可以起一定的作用。
    还有一点也是我所体会到的，就是借助于世界语，我们可以更广泛更直接地同各国的普通人发生接触；从这种比较深入的接触中，我们可以更多地了解他们，同时也可以帮助他们更多地了解我们。而这种相互了解，无疑是我们同他们建立友谊的一个必要的基础。
