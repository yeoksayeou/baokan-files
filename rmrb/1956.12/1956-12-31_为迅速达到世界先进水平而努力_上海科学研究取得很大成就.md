Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Dispatch: In 1956, scientists in Shanghai achieved many successes in their work.

    Antibiotic research, particularly the research into chlortetracycline with its high antibacterial efficacy, achieved significant successes this year. This work was carried out in collaboration by organic chemists, medicinal chemists, and microbiologists from various scientific research institutions and universities. In Shanghai, formal production of chlortetracycline is about to begin in 1957.

    The Institute of Organic Chemistry also synthesized an ion exchange resin this year that can be used to quickly extract pure streptomycin, greatly shortening the extraction process. In the research of new antibiotics, the Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has obtained several actinomycete antibiotics from Chinese soil.

    The Institute of Materia Medica conducted research on drugs for treating schistosomiasis, hypertension, and drugs that act on the nervous system. The Raumethylium extracted by this institute from Chinese-produced Rauvolfia serpentina has been preliminarily proven by pharmacological tests to have a significant effect in lowering blood pressure and is considered to be a promising drug for treating hypertension.

    The Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has made important progress in the study of the structure and function of proteins. Scientists have isolated a new protein from myofibrils and conducted preliminary research on its properties; comparative studies on the chemical structures of muscle proteins of different species and functions have yielded some meaningful results; the study of the physicochemical characteristics of connective tissue proteins has clarified some disputes in this area among foreign schools of thought. This institute has also made new progress this year in various aspects of research related to the nervous system, as well as research on enzymes and metabolism.

    The Institute of Experimental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, based on the theory of distant hybridization, hybridized castor silkworms and ailanthus silkworms. As a result, 60% of the tens of thousands of castor silkworms experimentally raised in the institute this year were able to overwinter as pupae, solving the problem that castor silkworms cannot overwinter under temperate conditions in China. The Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has determined that the internal reason for cotton boll shedding is due to insufficient or imbalanced nutrient supply. This research provides a new pathway for the theory of parthenocarpic fruits in plant physiology. Plant physiologists have also studied the effects of environmental factors such as soil moisture, fertilizer, and light intensity on boll shedding and have preliminarily provided various ways to prevent cotton boll shedding in agricultural production practice.

    The smelting research of Baotou fluorine-containing iron ore is a major contribution of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to national economic construction. After successfully trial-producing two types of high-grade alloy steel using boron, this institute has begun research this year on the role of boron in steel, further exploring theoretically why a small amount of boron added to steel can greatly enhance the mechanical strength of the steel. The research on Chinese porcelain conducted by the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics shows from experimental results that the quality of fine porcelain bodies and glazes has reached the level of the Kangxi and Qianlong periods of the Qing Dynasty. Based on this research result, production trials have been conducted in Jingdezhen.

    In 1956, scientists in Shanghai also made significant achievements in mathematics, physics, medicine, electrical engineering, mechanical manufacturing, bamboo utilization, and other fields.

    为迅速达到世界先进水平而努力
    上海科学研究取得很大成就
    据新华社上海电　1956年，上海的科学家们在工作中取得了许多成就。
    抗生素的研究，特别是具有较高抗菌效能的金霉素的研究，今年有了重要的成就。这些工作是由各科学研究机关和高等学校的有机化学家、药物化学家、微生物学家们合作进行的。在上海，1957年即将开始正式生产金霉素。
    有机化学研究所今年还合成了一种离子交换树脂，可以用来很快地提取纯粹的链霉素，大大缩短了提取过程。在新抗生素的研究中，中国科学院药物研究所已从中国土壤中获得几种放线菌的抗生物质。
    药物研究所对治疗血吸虫病、高血压病的药物和作用于神经系统的药物开展了研究。这个所新近从中国出产的萝芙藤中提取出的萝芙甲素，经过初步药理试验证明具有显著的降低血压作用，被认为很有希望成为治疗高血压病的特效药。
    中国科学院生理生化研究所关于蛋白质的结构和功能的研究有了重要的进展，科学家们从肌原纤维中分离出一种新蛋白，并对它的性质作了初步的研究；对不同种属和功能的肌肉蛋白的化学结构进行的比较研究，获得了一些有意义的结果；对结缔组织蛋白的物理化学特征的研究，澄清了国外若干学派在这方面的某些争端。这个研究所在有关神经系统的各方面的研究，以及酶和新陈代谢的研究，今年都有了新的进展。
    中国科学院实验生物研究所根据远缘杂交的理论将蓖麻蚕和樗蚕杂交的结果，使今年研究所内试验饲育的几万头蓖麻蚕中，有60％能够以蛹过冬，使蓖麻蚕在中国温带地区条件下不能过冬的问题得到了解决。中国科学院植物生理研究所对棉花落蕾落铃问题的研究，已确定了棉花蕾铃脱落的内在原因是由于食料供应不足或者失调。这个研究对植物生理学上的无子果实的理论，提供了新的途径。植物生理学家们同时还研究了土壤水分、肥料、光线强度等环境因素对蕾铃脱落的作用，并且初步提供了农业生产实践中防止棉花蕾铃脱落的各种途径。
    包头含氟铁矿的冶炼研究，是中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所对国家经济建设的一个重大贡献。在试制成功两种利用硼的高级合金钢以后，这个研究所今年又开始的硼在钢中的作用的研究，从理论上进一步探讨为什么微量的硼放进钢中能够大大加强钢的机械强度。冶金陶瓷研究所所进行的中国瓷的研究，从实验所得结果看，在细瓷胎釉的质量方面已达到了清朝康熙乾隆时代的水平，根据这项研究成果，已在景德镇进行了生产试验。
    1956年，上海的科学家们在数学、物理学、医学、电机、机械制造、竹材利用等方面的研究也都有了显著的成就。
