Changing the Phenomenon of Top-Heaviness
*People's Daily* Commentator

Many places are currently carrying out the work of abolishing districts and merging townships in a planned and step-by-step manner. The abolition of districts and merging of townships is to strengthen the direct leadership of counties over townships, to further strengthen the cadre strength of party and government organizations at the township level, and to enable them to more effectively exert the independent work efficiency of grassroots organizations, so as to adapt to the new rural situation after agricultural cooperativization. Therefore, when abolishing districts and merging townships, the first consideration should be how to properly arrange and use the strength of district cadres. Does this mean transferring all the district cadres with strong working ability to the county to work? Or assigning the vast majority of them to townships to enrich and strengthen the leadership at the township level? If this question is not properly resolved, it will have a great impact on the work of the county and townships.

In the past, generally speaking, district cadres were the backbone of rural leadership. They lived in the countryside all year round, contacted township and commune cadres every day, directly led and planned various tasks in the countryside, and came up with ideas and methods for township and commune cadres. In the long-term practical work, they have accumulated relatively rich leadership experience and are familiar with the local situation. Therefore, to strengthen the leadership at the township level, when abolishing districts and merging townships, the vast majority of district cadres should be placed in townships to enrich the leadership at the township level, so that grassroots party and government organizations can carry out their work independently, which is in line with the purpose of abolishing districts and merging townships.

However, many counties have not done this. When abolishing districts and merging townships, they transfer all the district cadres to the county, putting the original district party committee secretary in the county as a minister or section chief, and a large number of district cadres are also assigned to various agencies in the county. This has created an extremely abnormal situation: on the one hand, the cadre strength of grassroots organizations (townships) is very weak; on the other hand, the organizational structure of various agencies in the county is too large, forming a top-heavy situation. When Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, abolished districts and merged townships, it transferred all the original twelve district party committee secretaries and more than forty district committee members to the county. Now, apart from three district party committee secretaries who have already served as deputy ministers of various departments of the county party committee, the rest have not yet been assigned a position and are staying in the county's guesthouse with nothing to do. More than twenty district committee members were assigned to the organization department of the county party committee to serve as organizers who only talk to rural party members and rarely have practical work to do. The county party committee office transferred in seven district cadres, six of whom were "idle and feeling flustered." After Anda County in Heilongjiang abolished districts, it also transferred all cadres above the original district committee member level to the county to enrich the county-level organizational structure. Each department and section was equipped with four or five ministers or section chiefs, resulting in a decrease in the work efficiency of each department and section. It took several days for section chiefs to circulate a document. It also required a lot of running around to seek the opinions of various responsible persons to process an official document in one department. The organization department of the county party committee had a total of only seven staff members, but four ministers. Once, when a urgently needed document had to be copied, it happened that all three staff members were not at home, and the four ministers, because they were all leaders in the department, were unwilling to do the specific copying work. After these district cadres were transferred to the county, what they were originally familiar with was put aside, they were relatively unfamiliar with the work of the county's various departments, and they could not get involved in the work. Because they were used to running around in the townships, they were also very unaccustomed to sitting in the office all day in the county, so they all felt very depressed. They said, "When we arrive in the county, we can't go down (referring to going to the countryside), and we can't sit down (referring to sitting in the office). It's really suffering!"

On the other hand, the leadership of the townships has been greatly weakened. The working ability of township cadres is relatively low. In the past, when they encountered difficulties in their work, they could ask district cadres for help; now, a large number of district cadres have been transferred to the county, and most of them are far away from the townships, and it is difficult to communicate. In addition, after the county-level agencies became bloated, bureaucracy quickly grew. For example, after Anguang County in Jilin Province abolished districts and merged townships, from September 10th to 20th, Sijiazi Township in the county received more than 20 kinds of forms from the county, and they were all required to be submitted within five days. Recently, a township in Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, received phone calls from nine county-level units requesting information in one day. Therefore, the township cadres in some counties that have abolished districts and merged townships are very distressed. They said, "The district cadres have left, and the county cadres are not coming down. The tasks are so heavy that we really can't do it." Therefore, they urgently hope that some people with strong working ability will come to the township to work.

Faced with this top-heavy situation, what should the county leaders do? The correct way should be to resolutely streamline the upper level (county) and strengthen the leadership of grassroots organizations (townships). Recently, under the instructions and supervision of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee, 31 counties in Heilongjiang have taken resolute measures to withdraw a large number of district cadres who were originally transferred from the district to the county from the county-level agencies and send them to the townships to serve as party township general branch secretaries or township heads. All have achieved good results.

However, to this day, many top-heavy counties still have many concerns about streamlining county-level staff and strengthening the leadership at the township level. What are they worried about? First, they are afraid that doing so will affect the morale of the cadres, that these comrades who have been transferred up will have opinions on the county leaders, and that it will affect the current work; second, they are afraid that after these district cadres are transferred to the townships, the township cadres will be disunited, because the more responsible district cadres who are transferred down will inevitably serve as the first secretary of the township party general branch or the township head, so will the original general branch secretary and township head have to serve as the second secretary or deputy township head, and will this affect their work enthusiasm and cause disunity? Some counties, such as Jishui County in Jiangxi Province, even transferred all the more responsible cadres who had been sent to the townships back to the county in order to simply take care of the unity between the township cadres; third, they are afraid of weakening the work of the county-level departments. They said that when abolishing districts and merging townships, the county's various agencies had spent a lot of effort to get a few capable cadres in order to strengthen the work of their departments, and now they have to transfer them out again. Can they agree to it? Will it affect the work of the business departments?

In fact, the resolute measures taken by many counties to streamline the upper level and strengthen the leadership at the township level have proved that it is wrong to shrink back because of the above-mentioned concerns. Even if the above-mentioned problems occur, they can be solved smoothly. Anda County withdrew three deputy ministers of the county party committee, one bureau chief, and ten section chiefs (all original district cadres) from the county-level agencies and sent them to the townships to serve as the first secretaries of the township party general branch, which was well received by many township cadres and the masses in the county; at the same time, it also brought new progress to the work. The comrades who were transferred to work in the townships all believed that the county party committee attached great importance to them. They said, "We are all district cadres, familiar with the rural situation, and have deep feelings for the peasants. We are willing to go down to work." Some said: "We are not familiar with the work in the county, and we can't use our strength. Now that I am sent to the township to take charge of the work independently, it is exactly what I want." The comrades who originally worked in the townships were all very happy to see that the county had sent backbone forces. They believed that this time there were more backbone forces in the townships, and the work in the townships would definitely be done better in the future. Some township cadres said: "The county often says that rural work is important and that the leadership of the townships should be strengthened, but it never sends people. This time, we have seen the determination of the leaders." After Anda County withdrew a large number of cadres from the county-level agencies and sent them to the townships, it not only did not affect the business work of the county-level agencies, but also improved their work efficiency and brought into play the work enthusiasm of those cadres who were "idle and feeling flustered." Therefore, at present, in the counties that have already abolished districts and merged townships, it is necessary to thoroughly examine the use of the original district cadres, and if there is any improper use of district cadres, it should be quickly adjusted to quickly eliminate this unhealthy phenomenon of being top-heavy.

    改变头重脚轻的现象
    本报评论员
    目前许多地方都在有计划有步骤地进行撤区并乡工作。撤区并乡是为了加强县对乡的直接领导，是为了进一步加强乡一级的党政组织的干部力量，使其更有效地发挥基层组织的独立工作效能，以适应农业合作化以后的农村新形势。因此，在撤区并乡的时候应当首先考虑如何恰当地安排和使用区干部的力量问题。这就是说把工作能力较强的区干部统统都调到县上去工作呢？还是把他们中的绝大部分派到乡里去充实和加强乡一级的领导呢？这个问题如果得不到妥善的解决，对县和乡的工作的影响是很大的。
    以前，一般地说，作为农村领导骨干力量的是区干部，他们常年生活在农村中，天天和乡社干部接触，直接领导和策划农村的各项工作，为乡社干部出主意想办法。在长时期的实际工作中他们曾经积累了比较丰富的领导经验，熟悉本地区的情况。因此，要加强乡一级的领导力量，在撤区并乡的时候，应当把绝大部分的区干部安插到乡里去充实乡一级的领导，使基层党政组织能够独立地进行工作，这样才符合撤区并乡的目的。
    但是，却有许多县并没有这样做，他们在撤区并乡的时候，把区干部统统都调到县里来，把原来的区委书记放在县里当部长或科长，大批区干部也都被分配到县的各个机关中去。这样就形成了一种极不正常的情况：一方面基层组织（乡）的干部力量非常薄弱；另一方面县的各个机关的组织机构却过于庞大，形成了头重脚轻的局面。浙江省余姚县在撤区并乡的时候，把原有的十二个区的区委书记和四十多个区委委员都上调到县。现在这些区委书记除有三名已经担任了县委各部的副部长以外，其余至今还没有确定职务，住在县的招待所里无事可做。二十多个区委委员被分配到县委组织部担任只同农村党员谈话而很少有实际工作可做的组织员。县委办公室调进七个区干部，其中有六个人“闲得心里发慌”。黑龙江安达县在撤区以后，把原来区委委员以上干部也都调到县里充实县级各组织机构。每个部和科都配备了四个或五个部长或科长，结果各部科的工作效率反而降低了，科长之间要传阅一份文件几天还传阅不完。一个部处理一件公文也得东奔西走征求各个负责人的意见。县委组织部一共只有七个工作人员，就有四个部长。有一次要抄写一份急用的材料，恰好三个干事都不在家，四个部长因为都是部里的领导干部谁也不愿做这个具体的抄写工作。这些区干部被调到县上以后，原来所熟悉的东西被搁置起来，对县的各部门的业务比较生疏，工作插不上手，由于他们在乡里跑惯了，在县上整天坐办公室也很不习惯，因此都感到非常苦闷，他们说：“到了县里，下不去（指下乡），坐不下（指坐办公室），真是活受罪！”
    但在另一方面，对于乡的领导却大大削弱了。乡干部的工作能力比较低，以前在工作上遇到困难，还可以找区干部帮助解决；现在，区干部大批地调到县上去了，一般的都距离乡较远，想通个气也有困难。再加上县级机构臃肿之后，县里文牍主义又很快滋长起来，如吉林省安广县撤区并乡之后，从9月10日到20日该县的四家子乡就接到由县里发来的各样表格二十多种，而且都限期在五天内上报。最近浙江余姚县有一个乡在一天内有九个县级单位打电话索要情况。因此，有些撤区并乡的县的乡干部都十分苦恼，他们说：“区干部走了，县干部不下来，任务这样重，实在干不了。”因此他们迫切地希望能有一些工作能力比较强的人到乡上来工作。
    面对着这种头重脚轻的情况，县的领导上应当怎样办呢？正确的办法应当是坚决精简上层（县）加强基层组织（乡）的领导。黑龙江省最近在中共黑龙江省委和黑龙江省人民委员会的指示和督促下，有三十一个县采取坚决措施从县级机关中抽出大批原从区上调上来的区干部下派到乡上，担任党的乡总支书记或乡长。都获得了很好的效果。
    然而，至今仍有不少头重脚轻的县对于精简县级工作人员充实乡一级的领导问题，存在着重重顾虑。他们顾虑什么呢？第一他们害怕这样做会影响干部情绪，怕这些已经上调的同志对县的领导会有意见，会影响当前的工作；第二害怕这些区干部被调到乡里之后，乡干部之间会互相闹不团结，因为调下去的比较负责的区干部必然要担任乡党总支的第一书记或乡长，那么原来的总支书记和乡长就得做第二书记或副乡长，这样会不会影响他们的工作积极性和闹不团结呢？甚至有的县如江西吉水县等为了单纯地照顾乡干部之间的团结，竟把已经下派到乡上去的比较负责的干部统统又调回县里来；第三是害怕削弱县级各部门的工作。他们说在撤区并乡的时候，县的各机关为了加强本部门的工作，曾费了“九牛二虎”之力要了几个得力干部，现在又要调出去，他们能同意吗？会不会影响业务部门的工作？
    事实上，目前许多县已经采取的坚决精简上层、充实乡级领导的措施证明，因为以上这些顾虑就缩手不前，是不对的，即使发生上面所说的问题，也是可以顺利解决的。安达县从县级各机关中抽出县委副部长三名、局长一名和科长十名（都是原来的区干部）下派到乡担任了党的乡总支第一书记以后，得到了全县许多乡干部和群众的好评；同时给工作也带来了新的起色。被调到乡里工作的同志，都认为县委对他们很重用，他们说：“我们都是区干部，熟悉农村情况，和农民有深厚的感情，愿意到下面去工作。”有的说：
  “调到县里业务不熟悉，有力用不上，现在派我到乡里去独当一面，正合我的理想。”原来在乡里工作的同志，看到县里派来了骨干力量，个个心里都非常高兴，认为这回乡里的骨干多了，今后乡上的工作一定会做得更好。有的乡干部说：“县里常说农村工作重要，要加强乡的领导力量，可是总不派人来，这回才看到领导上的决心了。”安达县从县级机关抽出大批干部下派到乡上以后，不但没有影响县级机关的业务工作，反而使他们的工作效率提高了，发挥了那些“闲得心里发慌”的干部的工作积极性。因此，目前在已经实行了撤区并乡的县，有必要彻底地检查一下对原来区干部的使用情况，对区干部如有使用不当的，应当迅速加以调整，赶快消灭这种头重脚轻的不良现象。（附图片）
