Wuhan Takes Measures to Strengthen Organizational Leadership of Free Markets

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch) In the past month, with the opening of free markets in rural areas, agricultural and sideline products such as hens, fish, and beef have gradually increased in the Wuhan market, and the prices of fruits have also decreased. However, because the relevant departments have not kept up with the organizational leadership of the free market, some chaotic phenomena have appeared in the market. Not only are many non-state purchased and non-state-controlled commodities being traded, but also materials that are subject to state purchase and state-controlled purchase, such as oil and pork, are being freely traded and freely priced in the market. The prices of some commodities are even one or several times higher than the state price. Some handicraftsmen blindly raise the prices of their self-produced and self-sold products. The number of unlicensed vendors in the market is increasing significantly, and speculation is breeding. This situation has caused great dissatisfaction among the general public with prices and market order. The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee has continuously received a large number of letters from the masses, requesting the government to manage the current market.

On November 27, the Finance and Trade Office of the Municipal People's Committee held a meeting to study the market situation. The meeting decided to take the following measures to strengthen the leadership of the free market: First, in terms of market prices, state-owned commercial enterprises are required to allow a certain range of price freedom based on market supply and demand. At the same time, when prices are too low or too high, they should take measures such as purchasing, selling, and negotiating prices to stabilize prices and prevent speculation. State-owned companies should strengthen investigation and research work, and actively post listed prices at any time to guide market prices. Second, state-owned commercial departments will set up several commodity exchanges or firms in each district to carry out business in the spirit of "attentive service and convenient operation," and lead transactions in the free market through them. Third, before the end of December, the industrial and commercial administrative departments will conduct a review and registration of unlicensed vendors throughout the city, make appropriate arrangements for the lives of vendors who are not approved to operate, and only approve the operation of "middlemen" in the market who are indeed needed. Speculative behaviors such as buying and selling short to reap profits, as well as deceptive behaviors such as price gouging, adulteration, and short weight among vendors, must be strictly prohibited. Fourth, state-owned commercial departments are required to always have sufficient sources of goods needed by the general public in the free market to stabilize market prices and play a regulatory role in the free market.

    武汉市采取措施
　　加强对自由市场的组织领导
    本报武汉电　近一个月来，随着各地农村自由市场的开放，武汉市场上农副产品如母鸡、鱼、牛肉等逐渐增多了，水果的价格也有所降低，但是，由于有关部门对自由市场的组织领导工作没有跟上，市场上出现了一些混乱现象。不仅有许多非统购的和非国家掌握收购的商品，而且属于国家统购和国家掌握收购的物资，如油料、猪肉等等，也在市场自由经营，自由要价。某些商品的价格，竟比国家牌价高出一倍甚至几倍。某些手工业者盲目提高自产自销的产品价格。市场上无证的摊贩在大量增加，投机现象在滋生。这种情况使得广大市民对于物价和市场秩序极为不满。武汉市人民委员会不断接到大批群众来信，要求政府对目前的市场加以管理。
    11月27日，市人民委员会财粮贸办公室开会研究了市场情况。会议决定采取以下措施，加强对自由市场的领导：第一、在市场的物价方面，要求国营商业根据市场供求情况，一方面允许有一定范围内的价格自由；一方面在价格偏低偏高的时候，采取收购、抛售、议价等办法来稳定物价，制止投机。国营公司加强调查研究工作，随时主动挂出牌价，领导市场物价。第二、国营商业部门将在各区分别设立若干商品的交易所或行栈，本着“服务周到，经营方便”的精神开展业务，通过它们领导自由市场的交易。第三、工商行政部门在12月底以前，对全市的无证摊贩，作一次审查登记，对不批准营业的商贩的生活，进行适当安排，对市场中的
  “二道贩子”确属需要的才批准其经营。对买空卖空，转手牟利的行为和商贩中哄抬价格、掺假掺杂，短秤少码等欺骗敲诈等的行为，要严格加以取缔。第四、要求国营商业部门对自由市场中有关广大群众需要的商品，随时掌握足够平稳市场物价的货源，在自由市场中起吞吐的作用。　　（张碨）
