　　Basic Rights of Soviet Citizens
    Dr. of Law, Professor of the Soviet Union, Wei Alexandrov
    Twenty years ago, the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets adopted the Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. For twenty years, Soviet citizens have enjoyed the democratic rights and freedoms enshrined in the Soviet Constitution by law.
    The Soviet Constitution not only proclaims the socio-economic rights, political rights, and personal freedoms of citizens, but also guarantees the realization of these rights and freedoms. This is the characteristic of Soviet democracy.
    All citizens of the Soviet Union, regardless of nationality or race, can fully and equally enjoy the rights and freedoms stipulated in the Soviet Constitution. At the same time, any direct or indirect restrictions on the rights of citizens, or the stipulation of direct or indirect privileges for citizens based on their race and nationality, as well as various acts of propagating racial and national chauvinism or propagating racial and national hatred and contempt, shall be subject to legal sanctions.
    Women in the Soviet state enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of economic, state, cultural, and socio-political life.
    Soviet democracy most fully guarantees the satisfaction of all the basic and vital interests of the working people, and of course, first and foremost, their economic interests.
    Therefore, among all the rights of citizens proclaimed in the Soviet Constitution, the first is the right to work, that is, the right to be guaranteed employment and to receive remuneration according to the quantity and quality of work. This right is guaranteed by the socialist national economy without crises and unemployment and the continuous upsurge of Soviet social productive forces.
    In the Soviet Union, socialist production is constantly advancing and improving on the basis of advanced technology, which opens up unlimited possibilities for all citizens to apply their labor. This can be confirmed by practical materials. For example, from 1950 to 1955, the number of employees in the Soviet Union increased from 39.8 million to 47.9 million. By the last year of this five-year plan, that is, by 1960, the number of employees will reach 95 million.
    Every Soviet person has the full possibility to choose his or her favorite profession and the job he or she is most interested in. Any worker or staff member can leave his or her job at any time, as long as he or she informs the administration two weeks in advance so that the enterprise management can find new staff to replace them in time. Those who have worked in an enterprise for a long time are given extra rewards, such as higher sickness allowances, long-term service wage supplements, etc.
    The right to work in the Soviet state is inseparable from the right to rest. All employees have annual paid leave. The length of the leave varies, but is not less than twelve working days, depending on the heaviness of the work. In order to enable workers to make better use of their right to rest, there are a large number of state sanatoriums and rest homes for them to enjoy, and the number of sanatoriums and rest homes is expanding year by year. For example, in 1945 there were 1,107 sanatoriums and 516 rest homes, and by 1955, the number of sanatoriums had reached 2,178 and there were 939 rest homes. In addition, most of the fees paid by employees to go to sanatoriums and rest homes are preferential and they can fully afford them, and some are completely free.
    The Soviet Constitution stipulates that the length of the working day shall not exceed eight hours. At the same time, a seven-hour and six-hour working day is stipulated for many occupations with difficult working conditions, and a working day of no more than four hours a day for particularly difficult work. In the Sixth Five-Year Plan, a seven-hour working day will be gradually implemented from 1957 without reducing wages. Not long ago, a regulation was also adopted that laborers leave work two hours earlier than usual on holidays and before holidays.
    In the Soviet state, a six-hour working day system has been established for young people aged sixteen to eighteen. The labor of young people in Soviet enterprises and institutions is mainly of a learning nature, enabling them to gradually master a certain profession.
    The Soviet state is also very concerned about Soviet citizens who have lost their ability to work for some reason. The Soviet Constitution stipulates that Soviet citizens have the right to enjoy material security in old age, illness, and loss of ability to work. The extensive development of state-funded employee social insurance, free medical care, and a large number of sanatoriums for workers to enjoy fully guarantee this right in practice.
    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a new law on state preferential treatment in July 1956. This law greatly improved the guarantee of preferential treatment for Soviet workers. Most preferential treatment amounts have doubled or tripled. According to this law, men who reach the age of sixty and women who reach the age of fifty-five can receive pensions.
    Those who work in underground or hot workshops and under harmful labor conditions can receive preferential conditions for receiving pensions, that is, men at the age of fifty and women at the age of forty-five. In other jobs that are more laborious in terms of working conditions, men at the age of fifty-five and women at the age of fifty have the right to receive pensions. Now, employees with low wages can receive pensions equivalent to 100% of their monthly salary according to the new law, while the pensions of employees with higher wages are stipulated as 50% to 55% of their salary according to their working conditions.
    There is a clause in the Soviet Constitution that reads: "Soviet citizens have the right to education." This right is primarily guaranteed by the fact that tuition fees are waived from primary schools to universities, and all school expenses are borne by the state. Universal seven-year compulsory education has been implemented in the Soviet state, and now the transition to universal ten-year education has begun in cities.
    The following fact can fully and convincingly prove the scale of national education. In the 1955-1956 academic year, more than 50 million people were studying in the Soviet Union (including general training classes and cadre training classes), of which about 2 million were studying in universities, and the number of students in secondary specialized schools was also the same.
    Soviet university students enjoy scholarships. Students with particularly good grades can get higher scholarships.
    Due to the scale of education in the Soviet state, the number of experts in various sectors of the national economy is increasing year by year. On January 1, 1956, the number of specialized personnel with higher education and secondary education reached more than 5.55 million, while in 1928 there were only 521,000.
    The rights stipulated in the Constitution that we have briefly talked about above illustrate the social and economic situation of individuals in Soviet society. The Communist Party and the Soviet government are implementing various new measures to further improve the people's welfare. For example, a resolution on raising the wages of low-wage workers has recently been passed. Maternity leave for women has also been extended, and of course, wages are still retained.
    Soviet democracy endows Soviet citizens with huge and practical social and economic rights. These rights also make their political rights truly practical. In the Soviet Union, there is no dependence of some people on others, and there is no fear of losing a job and not finding a new one. This enables Soviet people to most fully enjoy the political rights granted to them by the Constitution. These rights are manifested in freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of publication, freedom of assembly, freedom of procession and demonstration, the right to join social organizations, and the right to vote for Soviet citizens.
    The right to vote is a clear manifestation of the full political rights enjoyed by citizens of the Soviet state. All state power organs, from local workers' representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, are elected by universal, equal, and direct suffrage using secret ballot. Through this right, Soviet citizens participate in the management of state affairs, determine national policies and the development path of Soviet society.
    Socialist democracy guarantees the election system, reporting system, and the possibility of replacing representatives. The direct responsibility of all responsible personnel in Soviet state organs is to unswervingly safeguard the legitimate interests of citizens. They should maintain close contact with the working masses, keenly listen to their opinions, and strive to correct the shortcomings they point out. The Soviet state resolutely struggles against the bureaucratic manifestations in individual links of state organs, the phenomenon of not paying attention to the needs and requirements of Soviet workers, and not paying attention to their criticisms and suggestions. It can be said with confidence that any illegal act of responsible staff members that harms the rights of citizens will not go unpunished. Derelict personnel will be removed from their posts, and if necessary, they will be held legally responsible.
    The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has approved a new regulation on the supervision of staff inspection work. The inspection agency has the responsibility to resolutely stop any acts that harm the rights of Soviet citizens, no matter who these acts come from. Based on this, the inspection agency has broad supervisory powers over the legality of the activities of various administrative organs, interrogation organs, and state security organs. The staff of the inspection agency should promptly review citizens' complaints about violations of the law and immediately take necessary measures.
    The measures taken in recent years to consolidate the Soviet legal system have promoted the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses and promoted the further development of socialist democracy.
    The rights and democratic freedoms granted to Soviet citizens by the Soviet Constitution guarantee the most basic and vital interests of the workers and open up broad venues for their creative construction work. The purpose of their construction work is to further improve the people's welfare and the prosperity of the Soviet socialist state.

　　苏联公民的基本权利
    苏联法学博士、教授　维·亚历山大罗夫
    二十年前，第八次非常苏维埃代表大会通过了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟宪法。二十年来，苏联公民享受着苏联宪法中由立法所固定下来的民主权利和自由。
    苏联宪法不仅宣布公民的社会经济权利、政治权利和个人自由，而且保证这些权利和自由的实现。这是苏维埃民主的特点。
    苏联全体公民，不分民族和种族，都能完全平等地享受到苏联宪法中所规定的权利和自由。同时，对于公民权利无论有任何直接或间接的限制，或者，根据公民的种族和民族不同而规定公民的直接或间接特权，以及各种宣传种族和民族独尊思想或宣传种族和民族的仇恨轻蔑等行为，都要受到法律的制裁。
    妇女在苏维埃国家中，在经济、国务、文化和社会政治生活各方面，都享有和男子平等的权利。
    苏维埃民主最充分地保证满足劳动人民的一切基本的切身利益，当然，首先是劳动人民的经济利益。
    因此，在苏联宪法所宣布的公民的一切权利中，占第一位的就是劳动权，即保障得到工作，并根据工作数量和质量得到劳动报酬的权利。这项权利是由没有危机和失业的社会主义国民经济和苏维埃社会生产力的不断高涨而得到保证的。
    在苏联，社会主义生产在高度技术的基础上时时刻刻地前进着，改善着，这就为全体公民应用自己的劳动开辟了无限的可能性。这一点可以由实际材料来证实。例如，从1950年到1955年苏联的职工人数从三千九百八十万人增加到四千七百九十万人。而到这一个五年计划的最后一年，即到1960年，职工的人数将达到九千五百万人。
    每一个苏联人都有充分可能来选择他所最喜欢的职业和他所最感兴趣的工作岗位。任何一个工人或职员，随时都可以离开工作岗位，只要在两星期以前先向行政上说明，以使企业管理处能及时找到新的工作人员来代替。对于那些长期在一个企业内工作的人，则赋与额外奖励，如较高的疾病补助费，长期工作的附加工资等。
    苏维埃国家中的劳动权是同休息权不可分割的。所有的职工每年都有保持原工薪的休假。休假期限不同，但是不少于十二个工作日，这要根据工作繁重与否来决定。为了使劳动者能够更好地利用自己的休息权，有大量的国家疗养院和休养所供他们享用，疗养院和休养所的数量逐年扩大。例如，1945年有一千一百零七所疗养院和五百一十六所休养所，到1955年，疗养院的数目已达到二千一百七十八所，休养所已有九百三十九所。此外，大部分职工到疗养院和休养所去所缴的费用，都有优待，都是他们完全能担负的，另外一部分则是完全免费的。
    苏联宪法曾规定工作日的长度不得超过八小时。同时对许多工作条件困难的职业规定了七小时和六小时的工作日，而工作特别困难的则一天工作不超过四小时。在第六个五年计划中，从1957年起还将逐渐实行七小时工作日，同时并不减低薪金。不久以前还采取了一项规定，即劳动者在休假日前和节日前比平常提早两小时下班。
    在苏维埃国家中，已为年在十六岁至十八岁的少年制定了六小时工作日的制度。少年在苏联企业和机关中的劳动，主要是带有一种学习性质，使他们能够逐步掌握某一种专业。
    对于那些因某种原因而丧失了劳动能力的苏联公民，苏维埃国家也是十分关怀的。苏联宪法规定苏联公民在年老、患病和丧失劳动能力的时候，有享受物质保证的权利。国家出资的职工社会保险的广泛发展，免费医疗，供劳动者享用的大量疗养院，就完全在实际上保证了这一项权利。
    苏联最高苏维埃在1956年7月通过了关于国家优抚金的新法案。这项法案大大改善了苏联劳动者的优抚金的保证。大多数优抚金金额都增加了一两倍。根据这项法案，男子达到六十岁，女子达到五十五岁就可以领取养老金。
    在地下或热车间工作以及在有害的劳动条件下工作的人，可以得到领取养老金的优惠条件，即男人五十岁，女人四十五岁。而在其他就工作条件来说是比较费力的工作中，男人五十五岁，女人五十岁，就有权领取养老金。现在，工薪不高的职工，根据新法案，可以得到相当于他们的月薪百分之百的养老金，而工薪较高的职工的养老金，则根据他们的工作条件，规定为工薪的50％至55％。
    苏联宪法中有一条写道：“苏联公民有享受教育权”。这一项权利首先是由从初等小学到高等学校全部免收学费，学校的一切开支都由国家负担而得到保证。在苏维埃国家已实行了普及的七年义务教育，而现在在城市里已经开始向普及的十年教育过渡了。
    下面这个事实完全可以令人信服地证明国民教育事业的规模。在1955年—1956年这一学年中，全苏联共有五千多万人在学习（包括一般训练班和干部训练班在内），其中约有二百万人是在高等学校学习，中等专科学校的学生数目也是这样多。
    苏联大学生享有助学金。成绩特别好的学生可以得到较高的助学金。
    由于苏维埃国家教育事业的这种规模，所以国民经济各部门中的专家的数量逐年增加。在1956年1月1日，受过高等教育和中等教育的专门人材的数目达到了五百五十五万多人，而1928年只有五十二万一千人。
    我们前边所简略地谈到的宪法规定的权利，说明了个人在苏维埃社会中的社会状况和经济状况。共产党和苏联政府正在实行各种新的措施来进一步提高人民的福利。例如，近来通过了关于提高低工薪工作者的工资的决议。妇女的产假也延长了，当然，工薪还是保留着的。
    苏维埃民主赋与苏联公民社会和经济方面的巨大而实际的权利。这些权利也使他们的政治权利具有真正实际的内容。在苏联没有一些人对另外一些人的依附，没有害怕失掉工作和找不到新工作的恐惧。这就使苏联人能最充分地享受宪法赋与他们的政治权利。这些权利表现在信仰自由、言论自由、出版自由、集会自由、游行及示威自由，结合于社会团体中的权利和苏联公民的选举权等方面。
    选举权是苏维埃国家公民享有充分的政治权利的确凿表现。全部国家政权机关，由地方劳动者代表苏维埃到苏联最高苏维埃，都是按普遍、平等和直接选举制用秘密投票法选举的。通过这项权利，苏联公民参与国家事务的管理，决定国家政策和苏维埃社会的发展道路。
    社会主义民主保证代表的选举制、报告制和可以撤换。苏联国家机关中一切负责人员的直接职责，是始终不渝地维护公民的合法利益。他们应该同劳动群众保持密切的接触，敏锐地倾听他们的意见，努力改正他们所指出的缺点。苏维埃国家坚决向国家机关个别环节中的官僚主义表现，不重视苏联劳动者的需要和要求，不重视他们的批评和建议的现象进行斗争。可以满怀信心地说，任何损害了公民权利的负责工作人员的非法行为，都不会不受到惩处。失职人员要被撤职，必要时还要负法律责任。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团曾批准了关于检查工作人员的监督工作的一项新条例。检查机关有责任坚决制止任何损害苏联公民权利的行为，无论这种行为来自何人。根据这一点，检查机关对各管理机关和审讯机关以及国家保安机关的活动的合法性有广泛的监督权。检查机关的工作人员要及时审查公民对破坏法制的控诉并立即采取必要的措施。
    近几年来实行的巩固苏维埃法制的措施，促进了广大群众的政治积极性和劳动积极性的高涨，促进了社会主义民主的进一步发展。
    苏联宪法赋与苏联公民的权利和民主自由，保证了劳动者最基本的切身利益，为他们的创造性的建设工作开辟了广阔的活动场所。而他们的建设工作的目的就是进一步提高人民的福利和苏维埃社会主义国家的繁荣。
