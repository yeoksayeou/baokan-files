    Indian Proverbs
    Cut down the thorns while they are still young,
    Don't wait until they prick your hand before acting.
    Don't slander someone behind their back,
    Even if they are impolite to your face.
    Even a respectable person will lose dignity,
    If they are accustomed to speaking empty words.
    Evil will bring more evil,
    Prevent evil like you would prevent a fire.
    If a person doesn't want to be despised,
    They should not do anything deceitful.
    Luck comes to those who are determined and act,
    When laziness begins, luck says goodbye.
    Rather be as humble as a beggar before a teacher,
    Than be a useless person without learning.
    A priceless treasure that will not be destroyed is a person's knowledge,
    No wealth can compare to it.
    A person who does not learn is like barren land that produces no grain,
    People can only say he is alive, and nothing more.
                                  (Translated by Jiu Quan)

    印度格言
    趁荆棘还幼小的时候砍倒它，
    别等到要刺破手的时候才动手。
    不要在一个人的背后诽谤他，
    即使他当面对你不客气。
    哪怕是可敬的人物也会失掉尊严，
    如果他习惯于说空话。
    罪恶会带来更多的罪恶，
    要像防止火灾一样防止罪恶。
    一个人如果不愿意受人鄙视，
    他就应该不要做任何欺骗的事。
    幸运降临给那下定决心而行动的人，
    什么时候开始懒惰，幸运就告别。
    宁愿在老师面前谦卑得像乞丐，
    不要不学无术成为一个废物。
    不会毁灭的无价之宝，是一个人的学问，
    任何财富不能同它相比。
    不学习的人像荒地不产谷物，
    人们只能说他是活着，此外什么也说不上。
                                  （酒泉译）
