Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: This year witnessed great achievements in the promotion of improved seed varieties.

According to statistics from the ongoing National Agricultural Work Conference, the promotion area of improved grain crop varieties reached over 680 million mu this year, and the promotion area of improved cotton varieties reached over 84 million mu. Simultaneously, the inter-provincial allocation of improved seeds reached over 1.2 billion jin this year, a figure that exceeds the total amount from 1953 to 1955 by more than 400 million jin. The timely allocation and promotion of large quantities of improved grain and cotton seeds have played a significant role in increasing grain and cotton crop production this year.

In this year's work on promoting improved seeds, the mass selection and retention of seeds and the establishment of seed plots in various localities have also seen new developments. According to incomplete statistics from over 200 counties in provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Qinghai, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, over 319 million jin of various improved crop seeds were selected in the summer and autumn seasons this year, and many excellent farmer varieties were also selected. In addition, the improved seeds propagated by agricultural cooperative seed bases in provinces such as Shandong, Jilin, Hunan, Guangdong, and Fujian also exceeded 1 billion jin. Nine provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Gansu, Liaoning, and Jilin, also selected areas with suitable conditions in over 80 counties, using methods such as organizing improved seed breeding zones or breeding cooperatives, adopting contract-based pre-breeding and pre-purchase, to systematically breed and supply large quantities of improved seeds to agricultural cooperatives.

In order to further strengthen the breeding, promotion, operation, management, and technical guidance of improved seeds, the state has decided to establish specialized seed organizations in all counties nationwide, and seed organizations have already been established in over 400 counties, with active preparations underway in those where they have not yet been established. Over 2,000 specialized county-level demonstration breeding farms nationwide will also systematically strengthen the breeding and supply of local improved seeds in the future.

    粮棉良种推广面积达七亿多亩
    对全国粮棉增产起了很大作用
    新华社15日讯　良种推广工作在今年获得了极大成绩。
    据正在进行的全国农业工作会议统计，今年粮食作物良种推广面积达六亿八千多万亩，棉花良种推广面积达八千四百多万亩；同时，今年省间调拨的良种达到十二亿多斤，这个数字比1953年到1955年三年的总数还要多四亿多斤。大批粮、棉良种的及时调拨和推广，对今年粮棉作物的增产起了很大作用。
    在今年的良种推广工作中，各地群众性的选种、留种和建立种子地的工作也有了新的发展。仅据河北、山东、黑龙江、吉林、青海、江西、广东等省二百多个县的不完全统计，在今年夏秋两季选出的各种农作物良种就有三亿一千九百多万斤，并且评选出不少优良的农家品种。此外，山东、吉林、湖南、广东、福建等五省农业社种子基地繁殖的良种也在十亿斤以上。河北、山东、山西、江苏、浙江、安徽、甘肃、辽宁、吉林等九省还在八十多个县内选择有条件的地区，用组织良种繁殖区或繁殖社、采取订立合同预约繁殖、预约收购的办法，有计划地给农业社繁殖和供应了大批良种。
    国家为了进一步加强良种的繁殖、推广和经营管理以及技术指导工作，已决定在全国各县建立专门的种子机构，并且有四百多县的种子机构已经建成，没有建立的也正在积极进行筹建。全国二千多个专、县示范繁殖农场，今后也将有计划地加强当地良种的繁殖和供应工作。
