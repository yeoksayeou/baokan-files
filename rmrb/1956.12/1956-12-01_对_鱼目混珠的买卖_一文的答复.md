　　Reply to "A Swindle in Broad Daylight"

    Editor's Note: This spring, Guangxi Province promoted the sale of alum to rural areas in large quantities as a substitute for fertilizer, which had undesirable consequences. The final handling of this matter is still awaiting further inspection by the Guangxi Provincial Supervisory Department.
    The article "A Swindle in Broad Daylight" was written by Comrade Li Fangchun. Our newspaper entrusted the readers' letters group of Guangxi Daily to verify the facts before publishing it. According to the reply from the Rural Work Department of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China to our newspaper, the Guangxi Provincial People's Committee's Department of Agriculture and the Guangxi Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company are responsible for this matter. However, it is obviously inappropriate to say that the Guangxi Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company's promotion of alum was "a swindle in broad daylight."
    The editors of our newspaper made mistakes in handling this稿件 (gao jian - draft/manuscript). For example, Li Fangchun's original manuscript stated: "Guangxi farmers have used ammonium chloride with good results... They absolutely did not expect anyone to take advantage of this..." But we changed the original text to "The Guangxi Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company came up with a lucrative idea. They thought that alum was similar in color and shape to ammonium chloride, so they purchased large quantities of alum to impersonate ammonium chloride and engaged in a swindle in broad daylight." This made the problem appear more serious. This is something we should pay attention to when writing articles in the future.

    On September 24th, the People's Daily published an article "A Swindle in Broad Daylight," criticizing the Guangxi Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company for promoting alum as a substitute for chemical fertilizer, causing losses in agricultural production. We sent people to the relevant departments to investigate this matter. The facts are as follows:

    Regarding the basis for using alum as a substitute for chemical fertilizer: According to the Provincial Department of Agriculture, before the Guangxi Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company promoted alum as fertilizer this spring, it sent the article "Promoting Agricultural Alum to Strive for Rice Harvest" compiled and printed by the Zhejiang Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company to the Department of Agriculture and sent people to contact the Department of Agriculture several times. Because there had been no experiments using alum as fertilizer in our province in the past, and the masses were not accustomed to using it, the Department of Agriculture convened a meeting to study the matter and finally decided to conduct trial promotion and issued a notice.

    Regarding publicity: The Provincial Department of Agriculture stated in its notice promoting alum: "Our province is experimenting with the promotion of alum as fertilizer, which may have a certain effect on increasing production. We hope that all units will study, experiment, promote, and use it." The notice from the Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company stated: "It has been found that alum contains ingredients such as potassium sulfate and aluminum sulfate, which are most effective when applied to rice crops." It also stated that "it can be fully promoted and used within the province." Comparing the two documents, the Chemical Raw Materials Company had exaggerated claims in its publicity.

    Regarding the effect of alum: Agricultural cooperatives have no specific yield comparisons regarding the effectiveness of alum as fertilizer. According to the results of early rice experiments conducted by the Guangxi Provincial Comprehensive Agricultural Experiment Station and the Nanning and Lipu Agricultural Experiment Stations, the observed growth during the growing season and yield comparisons showed no significant effect. In some areas, rice seedlings turned yellow after applying alum. For example, Lu Ming of the Jincha District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Mashan County wrote a letter to the Provincial People's Committee on July 2nd, stating: Six jin were applied per mu, mixed with organic fertilizer, but two days after application, all the rice seedlings in the field turned yellow and seemed to be dying. After discovering this, they immediately stopped using it. Another example is Lehong Cooperative, which purchased 7,000 jin of alum and applied 2,000 jin. The rice seedlings where alum was applied were far inferior to those where it was not applied, and there was a possibility of reduced yield. Various districts also reported that alum was not effective as fertilizer and had the opposite effect, requesting a refund. In Binyang County, about 2,000 mu of early rice seedlings turned yellow after applying alum. They were rescued after applying lime.

    The price of alum is also higher than that of ammonium sulfate. According to our province's supply and marketing cooperatives, the purchase price of alum is 300 yuan per ton, and the retail price is 360 yuan to 400 yuan per ton, with some individual areas charging 440 yuan. The purchase price of ammonium sulfate is 262 yuan per ton, and the retail price is 330 yuan. The Department of Agriculture's investigation in Lingui County found that alum cost 2 jiao and 3 fen per jin, while ammonium sulfate cost 1 jiao and 7 fen per jin.

    Based on the existing materials, we believe that the Provincial Department of Agriculture is largely responsible for agreeing to promote the use of alum as fertilizer and making inappropriate estimates of its fertilizer effect. However, the Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company engaged in one-sided publicity, purchased large quantities of goods, and had great blindness in its promotion work (although the Provincial Chemical Raw Materials Company's purchase volume was based on self-reported figures from various counties, this is related to the one-sided nature of the publicity). Currently, the Guangxi Provincial Supervisory Department is organizing forces to investigate the alum issue.

### 对“鱼目混珠的买卖”一文的答复

专栏：对批评的反应

　　对“鱼目混珠的买卖”一文的答复
    编者按　广西省今年春天以明矾代替肥料向农村大量推销，引起的后果是不好的。这件事情的最后处理还有待广西省监察厅继续检查。
    “鱼目混珠的买卖”一文是李芳春同志所写，本报委托广西日报读者来信组核对事实后才发表的。从中共广西省委农村工作部给本报的复信中看，广西省人民委员会农业厅和广西省化工原料公司对这件事情是要负责任的。不过，说广西省化工原料公司推销明矾是做“鱼目混珠的买卖”显然不妥当。
    本报编者处理这篇稿子是有缺点的。例如：李芳春的原稿上说：“广西农民使用过氯化铵，效果良好，……他们绝对没有想到有人会钻空子……”而我们把原文改成“广西省化工原料公司想出了一个生财有道的办法，他们以为明矾的色泽、形状和氯化铵相类似，于是大量购进明矾冒充氯化铵，干起鱼目混珠的买卖来。”这就使问题显得更加严重了。这一点是我们今后编写稿件时应该加以注意的。
    9月24日人民日报发表“鱼目混珠的买卖”一文，批评广西省化工原料公司以明矾代化学肥料推销，造成农业生产的损失。这件事我们曾派人向有关部门作了调查，现将事实经过情况分述如下：
    关于以明矾代化学肥料的依据问题。据省农业厅反映，广西省化工原料公司今春推广明矾作肥料之前，曾将浙江省化工原料公司编印的“推广农业肥矾为争取水稻丰收而努力”一文送交农业厅，并派人到农业厅联系过几次。农业厅因为本省过去没有使用明矾作肥料的试验，群众也没有使用习惯，因此召集会议研究，最后决定试验推广，并发出了通知。
    关于宣传的问题。省农业厅在推广明矾的通知中说：“我省试验推广明矾作肥料，对增产可能有一定作用，希各单位研究试验推广使用”；而省化工原料公司的通知中则说：“查明矾含有硫酸钾及硫酸铝等成分，对水稻作物施用效率最为显著”。又说“完全可以在省内推广使用”。两文对照，化工原料公司在宣传上有夸大的现象。
    关于明矾的效果问题。农业社对于明矾作肥料的效果好坏，均无具体产量比较，根据广西省综合农业试验站及南宁、荔浦农业试验站早稻试验的结果，生长期间观察和产量比较，效果都不显著，有些地区施用明矾以后，禾苗枯黄。例如马山县金钗区供销社陆鸣同志7月2日写信给省人民委员会略称：每亩施六斤，与有机肥混合施，可是施后二天的时间，田里禾苗全部变黄色，好像要枯死的样子，当时发现后即停止使用。又如乐红社购明矾七千斤，施下两千斤，施矾比不施的禾苗相差很远，有减产的可能。各区也都反映，明矾作肥料没有效力，反起相反的作用，要求退货。宾阳县一些农田施明矾后，约有两千亩早稻禾苗变黄，经施石灰后已抢救过来。
    明矾售价也比硫酸錏高。据我省供销社反映，明矾进货价每吨三百元，零售价每吨三百六十元至四百元，个别地区为四百四十元。硫酸錏每吨进货价二百六十二元，零售价三百三十元。农业厅到临桂县调查，明矾每斤价达二角三分，硫酸錏每斤一角七分。
    根据现有材料，我们认为省农业厅同意推广使用明矾作肥料，并对肥效作了不适当的估计，负有很大的责任。但是省化工原料公司片面宣传，大量进货，在推销工作上具有很大的盲目性（虽然省化工原料公司进货量是根据各县自报数，但是这和宣传的片面性有关）。目前，广西省监察厅正组织力量对明矾问题进行检查。
