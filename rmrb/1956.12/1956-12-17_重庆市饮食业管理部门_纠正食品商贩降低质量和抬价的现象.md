Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Telegram Chongqing municipal party and government leading organs recently received letters and feedback from the masses reporting that restaurants and food stalls were raising prices and deceiving customers with low-quality food. According to the opinions of the masses, the Chongqing Municipal Food Service Management Department has convened several meetings of负责人 (responsible persons) from state-owned restaurants and joint state-private stores to educate and inspect them. They were required to establish a point of view of serving consumers, improve their management style, and ensure the quality, quantity, and price of food. The Municipal Food Company is preparing to establish a price review committee to specifically review food prices.

The relevant units also organized more than seventy cadres and activists among small vendors to conduct an inspection of the prices and quality of the food service industry. Through inspection, substandard quality and speculative behavior were corrected. On the 5th, food vendors in many streets held forums to review and criticize each other for poor quality and price increases.
