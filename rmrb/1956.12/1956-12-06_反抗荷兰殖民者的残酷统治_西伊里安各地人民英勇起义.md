Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th. According to Jakarta newspapers today, seven Indonesians in West Irian have been shot and killed by Dutch troops following recent uprisings by the people of West Irian against Dutch rule.

The report said that another four people were killed in combat between Irian independence fighters and Dutch troops.

Uprisings erupted in several important locations and many inland areas of West Irian last month after Dutch rulers arrested several patriotic youths from West Irian.

The people of West Irian have protested the above-mentioned brutal killings to the Dutch Governor of Dutch Tia (the capital of the Dutch-controlled area on the island of Irian). However, the Dutch authorities ignored this protest.

Prior to this, reports indicated that Dutch colonialists had strengthened their military forces in West Irian in order to suppress uprisings by the people in that region and to counter the increasingly strong national demand by the Indonesian people for the recovery of West Irian.

According to Antara News Agency today, quoting West Irianese parliamentarian Suwaggs, West Irian's population is decreasing by 5% to 10% every year. He said the main reason for the population decrease is the fighting between different tribes provoked by the Dutch.

    反抗荷兰殖民者的残酷统治
　　西伊里安各地人民英勇起义
    据新华社雅加达4日电　据雅加达报纸今天登载的西伊里安消息说，在最近西伊里安人民发动反对荷兰统治的起义以后，有七名印度尼西亚人在西伊里安被荷兰军队枪杀了。
    消息说，另外有四个人在伊里安独立战士同荷兰军队作战的时候被打死。
    由于荷兰统治者逮捕了西伊里安的几名爱国青年，西伊里安的好些重要地方和许多内地地区在上个月都爆发了起义。
    西伊里安人民已经对上述残暴屠杀行为向荷兰蒂亚（伊里安岛上荷兰控制地区的首府）的荷兰总督提出抗议。但是，荷兰当局不理这一抗议。
    在这以前，有消息说，荷兰殖民主义者已经加强了它们在西伊里安的军事力量，目的是要镇压那一地区人民的起义，以及对付印度尼西亚人民日益高涨的收复西伊里安的民族要求。
    据安塔拉通讯社今天援引西伊里安籍议员苏瓦格斯的话说，西伊里安的人口每年都减少5％到10％。他说，人口所以减少主要是由于荷兰人所挑起的不同部落间的战斗。
