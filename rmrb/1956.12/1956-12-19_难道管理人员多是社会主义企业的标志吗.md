Are Many Managers a Sign of Socialist Enterprises?
Kong Sang

I often hear people say that the management structure of newly established joint state-private industrial enterprises is unsound and must be transformed according to the management principles of socialist enterprises. Generally speaking, this statement is correct. However, people have different understandings of what constitutes a sound structure and what constitutes an unsound structure. Because of different understandings, the effects of the transformation vary.

For example, some people say that the management structure of new joint ventures is unsound, referring to the fact that the enterprise management structure is bloated, overstaffed, mutually obstructive, and inefficient. During the transformation, they streamlined the organization and reduced management personnel based on production needs. As a result, it was easier for everyone to give play to their work enthusiasm, reduced management costs, and lowered product costs. This approach is undoubtedly correct.

However, some people say that the organization is unsound, not because there are too many management personnel, but because there are too few. For example, many new joint venture factories have only a dozen or twenty production workers, managed by a capitalist. This capitalist manages the factory, the retail department, the purchase of raw materials, the sales of products, and the planning and finance. Although he holds several positions, he manages the enterprise in an orderly manner, neither owing workers' wages nor failing to make a profit. This kind of management experience, which is very suitable for the characteristics of small factories, is also listed by some comrades as belonging to factories with "unsound structures."

The reason why some people say that the "structure" of this type of enterprise is "unsound" is mainly from a formalistic point of view. They feel that small socialist enterprises should also implement planned management like large enterprises, and to implement planned management, they must bring in the management system of large enterprises. Therefore, planning, finance, technology, records, general affairs, personnel, and other work must be handled by dedicated personnel, otherwise, responsibilities will be unclear. However, they have overlooked an important fact: small factories with only a dozen or twenty people cannot afford so many management personnel. If management costs are too high, product costs will increase. If product costs are high, it will not be easy to sell, and originally profitable enterprises will become loss-making enterprises.

Of course, it is not to say that the management system of originally managing a small factory by one person cannot be transformed at all; but it is only to say that some management methods of capitalist enterprises do not violate the management principles of socialist enterprises. The experience of managing a small factory by one person as mentioned above is one of them. When transforming these enterprises, we should inherit and promote these experiences that are useful to us. It must be understood that increasing management personnel, increasing management costs, and increasing product costs are by no means the purpose of transforming enterprises, nor are they the management principles of socialist enterprises. More than ten days ago, at a symposium of public representatives of joint ventures convened by the Ministry of Light Industry, a responsible comrade talked about a lesson learned from arbitrarily changing the management system. He said that there was a factory in Henan with only twenty workers. Before the joint venture, only the boss led and managed production, and the business was very good. After the joint venture, the number of management personnel increased to four, so the product cost increased, and the enterprise was losing money. Sometimes, even the workers' wages could not be paid. The workers had opinions and their production enthusiasm was not high. Later, the higher authorities called for increasing production and practicing economy, and the public representative invited the workers to a meeting to tap potential. One worker said excitedly: "Before the joint venture, we had twenty workers and one person managed us. Now there is one manager for every five workers. How can the factory not lose money? To increase production and practice economy, we must cut management personnel. If there are fewer management personnel, the factory will make money, and we will have wages and bonuses, and our production enthusiasm will be high."

What this worker said is very good: he pointed out the source of the disease and prescribed the prescription. (Attached picture)

    难道管理人员多是社会主义企业的标志吗
    孔桑
    常常听到人说：新公私合营工业企业的管理机构不健全，必须根据社会主义企业管理原则加以改造。一般说来，这句话是正确的。但是，对于什么样的机构是健全的，什么样的机构是不健全的，各人的认识可就有不同了。因为认识不同，所以改造的效果有好有坏。
    例如有的人说新合营企业的管理机构不健全，指的是企业管理机构臃肿，人浮于事，互相阻碍，工作效率不高。在改造的时候，他们就根据生产需要，精简机构，减少管理人员。结果，既便于大家发挥工作积极性，又减少了管理费用，降低了产品成本。这种做法，毫无疑问是正确的。
    然而，有的人说机构不健全，指的不是管理人员太多，而是太少，例如许多新合营工厂只有十几二十个生产工人，由一个资本家管理。这个资本家既管工厂，又管门市部，既管购买原材料，又管推销产品，既管计划又管财务。他虽身兼数职。但把企业管理得有条有理，既不欠工人工资，又获得利润。像这种非常适合于小厂特点的管理经验，也被一些同志列入“机构不健全”的工厂的行列里去。
    有的人所以说这一类企业的“机构不健全”，主要是从形式主义的观点来看的。他们觉得社会主义的小企业也应该跟大企业一样实行计划管理，而要实行计划管理，就必须把大企业的一套管理制度搬进来，于是计划、财务、技术、纪录、总务、人事等等工作，都得有专人负责，否则就会职责不清，责任不明。然而，他们忽视了一个重要事实，就是十几二十人左右的小工厂养不活这么多管理人员，管理费太多，产品成本就会提高，产品成本一高，就不容易推销，原来赚钱的企业就会变成赔钱的企业。
    当然不是说，原来一个人管理一个小厂的管理制度就没有什么可以改造的；而只是说有些资本主义企业的管理方法，并不违背社会主义企业管理原则，像上面所说一个人管理一个小厂的经验就是其中之一。在改造这些企业的时候，应该把这些对我们有用的经验继承下来，并加以发扬。要知道：增加管理人员，增加管理费用，提高产品成本，绝不是改造企业的目的，也绝不是社会主义企业的管理原则。十多天以前，在轻工业部召集的合营企业公方代表座谈会上，一位负责同志曾讲过一个随便改变管理制度的教训。他说河南有一个工厂，只有二十个工人，在合营以前只有老板一个人领导和管理生产，营业很不坏，合营以后，管理人员增加到四人，于是产品成本增加，企业老赔钱，有时候连工人的工资都发不出去。工人们有意见，生产情绪不高。后来上级号召增产节约，公方代表找工人来开会挖潜力。有一位工人很激动地说：“合营以前，我们二十个工人，一个人管理，现在是每五个工人有一个管理人员，工厂怎么不赔钱呢？要想增产节约，就必须裁减管理人员。管理人员少了，工厂就有钱赚了，我们也就有了工资和奖金，我们的生产积极性就会高涨起来。”
    这位工人的话讲得很好：指出病源，又开了处方。（附图片）
