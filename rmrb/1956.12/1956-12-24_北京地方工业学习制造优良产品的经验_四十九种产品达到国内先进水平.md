Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd. Beijing's local state-owned industries have seen forty-nine types of their products reach advanced domestic quality levels. Rubber sneakers, previously known for their poor quality as "delicate shoes" or "Sunday shoes," are now as popular with consumers as those from Shanghai. The woolen fabric produced by the Qinghe Woolen Mill regularly achieves a first-class product rate of over 98%. The eleven types of woodwind and brass instruments produced in Beijing have a mellow tone and beautiful appearance, making them top-tier products in China. Daily necessities whose quality has reached advanced domestic levels also include blue ink, plush, fleece sweaters and pants, bleached cloth, pianos, and accordions. The quality of petroleum asphalt felt, belt conveyors, marble, machine-made red bricks, plywood, and other products supporting national construction has also reached advanced levels. These products are not only selling well in Beijing but are also welcomed when shipped to other regions.

　　At the beginning of this year, Beijing's local state-owned industries set the goal of having the quality of major products catch up with the advanced national level. Factories collected quality standards of excellent domestic products to compare with their own and formulated improvement plans. In the process of improving product quality, seventy factories successively sent people to advanced factories in other regions or within Beijing to learn advanced experiences. Factories also strengthened technical management, universally adding necessary testing and experimental equipment this year, establishing raw material testing and semi-finished product inspection processes. The four industrial bureaus also established and improved central laboratories for electrical machinery, machinery, chemistry, building materials, textile dyeing, and other areas. These all played a role in improving product quality.

　　Currently, the industrial bureaus and factories in Beijing are formulating plans to improve product quality next year.

    北京地方工业学习制造优良产品的经验
    四十九种产品达到国内先进水平
    新华社22日讯　北京市地方国营工业有四十九种产品的质量已经赶上国内先进的水平。原来因为质量不好被人们称为“娇鞋”、“礼拜鞋”的橡胶球鞋，现在已经同上海的产品一样受消费者的欢迎。清河制呢厂生产的毛呢，一等品经常在98％以上。北京出产的十一种木管、铜管乐器发音柔美，外观漂亮，已经成为国内第一流产品。质量赶上国内先进水平的日用品还有蓝墨水、长毛绒、绒衣衫裤、漂白布、钢琴、风琴等。支援国家建设的石油油毡、皮带运输机、大理石、机制红砖、胶合板等产品质量也都赶上了先进水平。这些产品不仅在北京市畅销，运往外地也受到了欢迎。
    今年年初，北京市地方国营工业就提出了主要产品质量赶上全国先进水平的目标，各厂纷纷搜集国内优良产品的质量标准，同自己产品比较，并且订出改进规划。在提高产品质量的过程中，有七十个工厂先后派人到外地或本市的先进工厂学习先进经验。各厂还加强了技术管理工作，今年普遍增添必要的化验、试验设备，建立原材料化验和半成品检验工作，四个工业局也建立和健全了电机、机械、化学、建筑材料、纺织染等各个中心试验室。这些都对提高产品质量起了作用。
    目前北京市各工业局、各工厂正在制定明年提高产品质量计划。
