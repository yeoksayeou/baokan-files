	Breed More Piglets
	By our commentator
	In order to greatly develop the pig-raising industry, much work needs to be done now. The planned breeding of an appropriate number of boars and sows to accelerate the breeding of piglets is an important task.
	According to the survey statistics at the end of June this year, sows accounted for approximately 9.8% of the total pig population nationwide; the ratio of boars to sows was roughly one to twelve. According to estimates, in order to complete the 1957 pig-raising plan, from June of this year to the end of next year, if each of these sows produces three litters, with an average survival rate of six and a half piglets per litter, there will still be a shortage of seven million four hundred and forty thousand piglets. To make up for this shortfall, it will be necessary to select and retain an additional one million four hundred and eighty thousand new sows. This is the national situation. If we look at different regions separately, some key pig-producing provinces are experiencing even more severe shortages of boars, sows, and piglets. The proportion of sows in the total pig population is 8.3% in Henan and Liaoning, and 7.3% in Sichuan.
	Due to the shortage of breeding pigs and piglets, the phenomenon of "pre-ordering before birth" has already appeared in many areas. Piglet prices have risen sharply, and many agricultural cooperatives and farmers are running around trying to buy piglets, yet they are still difficult to find. It is expected that after a relatively large increase in the purchase price of fattened pigs, an appropriate change in the processing methods of agricultural products, and the large-scale restoration of rural side-businesses such as tofu and noodle workshops, the enthusiasm of farmers for pig-raising will be greatly increased, and the shortage of piglets may become even more serious.
	Planned and appropriate selection and retention of breeding pigs, and local breeding of piglets, is the basic way to open up pig sources. Each county should select and retain a certain number (generally, sows should account for 12%-15% of the total pig population, and the ratio of boars to sows should be one to fifteen to twenty for double mating and repeated mating, and one to twenty to twenty-five for single mating) of breeding boars and sows, based on the county's pig development plan, the relevant situation in neighboring counties, and the historical supply and demand relationship of piglets. They should also guide and help agricultural cooperatives and farmers to breed piglets, striving to achieve self-breeding and self-raising in a relatively short period of time (one to one and a half years). Self-breeding and self-raising is the most reliable way to solve the problem of piglet sources. At the end of last year, Wangcheng County in Hunan Province had only 70,000 pigs. At the beginning of this year, the county proposed a plan to develop 450,000 pigs in 1956, achieving the goal of one pig per person in the county. They promptly solved the problem of opening up pig sources, trained one thousand boars and forty thousand sows, and implemented the policy of self-breeding and self-raising and self-reliance. This task was quickly completed. By the end of August, the number of pigs in the county had increased to 250,000, a three and a half-fold increase compared to last year. The piglets they bred not only met the needs of farmers in the county, but also transferred more than 30,000 heads to other counties.
	Using double mating and repeated mating methods can accelerate the breeding of piglets. Many regions in our country have adopted this method and achieved good results. In Wangcheng County, Hunan Province, a total of 10,553 sows were double-mated and re-mated in August, with the most productive one producing twenty-six piglets. Zhu Xiangfeng, a resident of Chengnan Town, Liu'an County, Anhui Province, fed a sow that gave birth to thirty-two piglets in one litter due to the adoption of the double mating method; these piglets are all growing very well. Increasing the piglet reproduction rate and producing more piglets with fewer sows can also save a large number of sows, which can be used as meat fattening pigs, relatively increasing the amount of pork. State-run farms and agricultural cooperatives with the necessary conditions should accelerate the promotion of this good method.
	Raising breeding boars and sows requires certain techniques and equipment. In addition to state-run livestock farms and state-run farms should raise as many breeding pigs as possible, agricultural cooperatives should also raise more public breeding pigs to facilitate the improvement of breeds and the promotion of advanced breeding experience. At present, raising boars and sows is more profitable. If experienced members are willing to raise them, agricultural cooperatives should actively support them and help them solve various difficulties.
	Adjusting piglets between regions and stabilizing piglet prices is also a major issue. Even if each region plans to select breeding pigs for self-breeding and self-raising, it is still inevitable that there will be a surplus or shortage of piglets at certain times and places. Although self-breeding and self-raising is the basic way to solve the current problem of insufficient piglets, the historical situation of the natural circulation of piglets cannot be prohibited. Regional adjustment for the purpose of improving pig breeds is even more indispensable. Therefore, state-owned food companies and supply and marketing cooperatives must effectively undertake the work of managing and adjusting piglets, and can also organize small vendors for short-distance transportation and adjustment. Local commercial administrative departments should appropriately control the price of piglets based on the current historical situation and the surplus or shortage of piglets, and strengthen market leadership.

    多多繁殖仔猪
    本报评论员
    为了大量发展养猪事业，现在要作许多工作。有计划地饲养适量的公、母猪，以便加速繁殖仔猪，就是一项重要工作。
    根据今年6月末的调查统计，全国的母猪约占整个猪群的9.8％；公猪和母猪的比例大体是一比十二。据推算，要想完成1957年的养猪计划，从今年6月到明年年底，如果这些母猪每头生产三胎，每胎成活六头半计算，还缺少仔猪七百四十万头。要想补足这个缺数，就需要再选留一百四十八万头新母猪。这是全国的情况。如果分开地区来看，有些重点产猪省份，缺少公、母猪，仔猪不足用的情况更加严重。母猪占全部猪群数的比重，河南、辽宁是8.3％，四川是7.3％。
    由于种猪不够，仔猪缺少，不少地区已经出现了“指腹定购”的现象。仔猪价格急剧上升，许多农业社和农民到处奔走，还难买到仔猪。预计在较大幅度上提高了肥猪收购价格，适当地改变农产品加工办法，农村中豆腐坊、粉坊等副业生产大量恢复以后，农民养猪的积极性将会大大提高，仔猪供应不足的情况可能更加严重。
    有计划地适量地选留种猪，就地繁殖仔猪，是开辟猪源的基本办法。每一个县都应当根据本县生猪发展计划、附近县份的有关情况和历来的仔猪供求关系，选留一定数量（一般地区母猪应占整个猪群的12％—15％，公猪和母猪的比例：双重交配和复配应当是一比十五到二十，单配一比二十到二十五）的种公猪和种母猪，并且指导、帮助农业社和农民繁殖仔猪，争取在较短的时期内（一年到一年半）作到自繁自养，自繁自养是解决仔猪来源问题的最可靠的办法。湖南望城县去年年底仅有生猪七万头。今年年初，这个县提出1956年发展生猪四十五万头，达到全县每人有一头猪的计划。他们及时地解决了开辟猪源的问题，培养公猪一千头，母猪四万头，贯彻实行自繁自养、自力更生的方针，这个任务很快地就完成了。到8月底，全县生猪已发展到二十五万头，比去年增加三倍半。他们繁殖的仔猪不但满足了本县农民的需要，还调给外县三万多头。
    采用双重交配和复配的方法，可以加速仔猪的繁殖。我国已有不少地区采用这种方法，收到很好的效果。湖南望城县8月份共双配、复配了一万零五百五十三头母猪，最多的一头产仔猪二十六头。安徽六安县城南镇朱祥凤喂养的母猪，由于采用了双配法，一胎生下三十二头仔猪；这些仔猪长的都很好。提高仔猪繁殖率，用较少的母猪生产较多的仔猪，还可以节省大批母猪，用作肉用育肥猪，相对地增加猪肉数量。各国营农场和有条件的农业社，都应该加速推行这种良好的方法。
    饲养种公猪和种母猪，需要一定的技术和设备。除了国营种畜场、国营农场应该尽可能地多养种猪以外，农业社也要多多地公养种猪，以利改良品种和推行先进繁殖经验。目前饲养公母猪利润较大，有经验的社员如果愿意饲养，农业社要积极给予支持，帮助他们解决各种困难。
    地区和地区之间调剂仔猪，稳定仔猪价格，也是一件大事。即使各个地区都有计划地选留种猪自繁自养，一时一地还是难免发生仔猪有余或不足的现象。自繁自养虽然是当前解决仔猪不足问题的基本办法，但历史上仔猪自然流转的情况还不能予以禁止。为了改良生猪品种而进行地区调剂，更是不可缺少的。因此，国营食品公司和供销合作社必须切实地担负起经营和调剂仔猪的工作，同时可以组织小商小贩进行短距离的贩运调剂。各地商业行政部门应该根据当前历史情况和仔猪的盈缺情况，适当掌握仔猪的价格，加强市场的领导工作。
