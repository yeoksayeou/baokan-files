Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 2nd. The Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, led by Lin Yancheng, a national model of agricultural production, harvested an average of 1,413 jin per mu of double-season rice this year on its 920 mu of land, an increase of 71.3% compared to last year. Among them, 10.59 mu of high-yield fields averaged 1,805.9 jin per mu; and 1.88 mu yielded 1,927.2 jin per mu.

Although the Yunguang Agricultural Cooperative's rice production increased this year compared to last year, the cooperative's total income decreased significantly. This is mainly because the principle of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily" was not implemented well enough. Too much commercial fertilizer was used for early rice, resulting in a significant increase in the cost per mu of rice. At the same time, the cooperative's diversified operations were not well-managed, and the plans for sideline production such as burning ash and raising ducks, which were revised in the summer, were not realized. As a result, only 282 out of the cooperative's 337 households (83.68%) increased their income.

### 水稻生产增加了，总收入却减少了

　　水稻生产增加了，总收入却减少了
    新华社广州2日电　全国农业增产模范林炎城领导的广东省揭阳县云光农业社，今年九百二十亩双季稻平均每亩收一千四百一十三斤，比去年增产71.3％。其中有十点五九亩丰产田，平均每亩收一千八百零五点九斤；有一点八八亩每亩收一千九百二十七点二斤。
    今年云光农业社虽然水稻比去年增产，但是全社总收入却大大减少。这主要是“勤俭办社”的方针贯彻执行得不够好，早稻使用商品肥料过多，以致每亩水稻的成本大大提高。同时，社的多种经营也没有搞好，夏季修订的烧灰、养鸭等副业生产的计划都没有实现。结果，全社三百三十七户中只有两百八十二户（占83.68％）增加了收入。
