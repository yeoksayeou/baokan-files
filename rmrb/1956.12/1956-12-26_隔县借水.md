    Borrowing Water Across County Lines

    Although Jue Ming Township in Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, and Gao Feng Township in Hong'an County of the same province are adjacent to each other, the farmers in the two places rarely interact. This autumn, the wheat and rapeseed fields in Jue Ming Township were so dry that cracks appeared in the ground. To save the wheat and rapeseed seedlings, the cadres of the township's Party branch searched for water sources everywhere. When they discovered a pond with more than eighty mu of land in the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative of Gao Feng Township, containing three chi of water, they planned to borrow water from the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative, but they hesitated. Because the two townships were not in the same county and it was a dry period, who knew whether they would lend the water or not. Finally, they contacted the director of the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative with a tentative attitude. To their complete surprise, Hu Youping and others, the director of the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative, not only agreed to provide them with the water free of charge, but also offered to provide manpower and material support.

    When the cadres of Jue Ming Township told the exciting news to the farmers in the township, everyone beamed with joy. Old farmer Chen Jinshan said with emotion, "In the past, let alone borrowing water across county lines, even buying it locally with money, those who had water wouldn't sell it! It's true that farmers all over the world are one family."

    On the day of opening the canals and releasing the water, many people arrived at the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Gao Feng Township with gratitude. With the help of the Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative, the waterways were quickly opened. When the farmers of the two counties watched the gurgling water flow across three or four li of land and into the fields of the Eastern Second Cooperative of Jue Ming Township, smiles appeared on their faces. The more than three thousand mu of wheat and rapeseed seedlings in Jue Ming Township were freed from the threat of drought, turning from yellow to green. (Ye Maoliang)

    隔县借水
    湖北新洲县的觉明乡与同省红安县的高峰乡，虽是毗连搭界，但两地的农民却很少往来。在今年秋季，觉明乡的麦田和油菜田旱得裂开了缝。为了抢救麦苗和油菜苗，这个乡的党支部的干部到处寻找水源。当他们发现高峰乡新华农业社有一口盛有三尺深水的八十多亩大的塘的时候，就打算向新华农业社借水，可是又犹豫不决。因为两乡不在一个县，又处在干旱时期，谁知道人家借给不借给。最后，还是抱着试探的态度和新华农业社主任取得联系。真是完全出乎他们的意料，新华农业社的主任胡幼平等，不仅答应无偿地供他们使用，还表示要给予人力、物力的支援。
    觉明乡干部把这个令人兴奋的消息告诉全乡农民的时候，个个喜笑颜开。老农陈金山感慨地说：“要在过去，莫说是隔县借水，就是在当地用钱买，有水的人还不卖哩！这真是天下农民是一家。”
    到开沟放水的那天，许多人怀着感激的心情到了高峰乡新华农业社。在新华农业社的帮助下，很快就把水路开好了。当两县农民望着哗啦啦的水流过三、四里地进入觉明乡东方二社的田地的时候，他们的脸上都露出了微笑。觉明乡的三千多亩麦苗和油菜苗，摆脱了干旱的威胁，由黄转青了。（叶茂良）
