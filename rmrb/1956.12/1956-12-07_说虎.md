　　On Tigers
　　Zhou Jianren
    The tiger is a famously ferocious animal. In ancient times, brave generals were called tiger generals. Today, powerful large-head pliers are called tiger-head pliers. Also, spiders that prey on flies are generally called fly-tigers, and lizards that patrol walls and prey on small insects are called wall-tigers. The tiger has become a representative term for creatures that kill living things.
    When I was a child, I saw the "Little Wooden Head" play (i.e., puppet show), which had a scene of "Tiger Fighting," in which the tiger fighter was swallowed whole by the tiger. In recent years, I saw the Soviet art troupe's puppet show "Tiger Taming," which was similar to the aforementioned "Tiger Fighting," where the tiger tamer was also swallowed whole. The saying that describes numb and unalert people as those who "look to see if it's male or female after a tiger is chasing their behinds" all depict the tiger's ferocity.
    The tiger is a carnivorous beast that loves to eat fresh meat and drink fresh blood. Cattle, pigs, deer, and other beasts are all for its consumption. It also eats birds such as chicks. If it comes to villages, it will attack domestic animals such as cattle and pigs. Farmers know that tigers can carry large pigs in their mouths and jump over pigsties or short walls. Farmers can tell whether the attacker is a wolf or a tiger by whether the pig was killed and eaten inside the sty or dragged away whole.
    The tiger's body size is roughly similar to that of the African lion; both are famous ferocious beasts. However, some experienced zoologists speculate that if lions and tigers were to fight, victory might fall to the tiger. The ancients (both in the East and the West) considered the lion the king of beasts, mostly because African male lions have long manes that are scattered on the sides of their heads, making them look very imposing. However, there are reasons to believe that tigers are stronger and fiercer.
    The tiger's fur color is undoubtedly very beautiful. It is generally orange-yellow with black stripes. Some individuals have very dark fur, almost black, which are called black tigers. There are also very light ones, almost off-white, which are called white tigers, but they are rarely seen. Chinese ancients, I don't know how, used this name for the name of a star constellation. For example, they said that the White Tiger Star is a kind of fierce god!
    Tigers also vary in size. Northeast tigers (produced in the Xing'an Mountains, etc.) are larger, and their fur is longer and denser. Fujian tigers are smaller, and their fur is shorter. Although tigers have a certain habitat, they also like to roam. For example, Zhejiang Province does not have tigers permanently, but sometimes tigers suddenly appear. Fucheng in Shaoxing used to have tigers, but they disappeared later. Several years ago, a large tiger suddenly appeared in Lishui. At first, it attacked livestock, and then one day, a newlywed bride was eaten by this big bug on her way back to her mother's house after the wedding. It is said that at that time, some armed soldiers in the area, with the responsibility to eliminate harm for the people, went to besiege it. The tiger was defeated, but several soldiers were injured. I heard that one died in the hospital, but the details are unknown. Originally, hunting ferocious beasts requires specially made ferocious beast guns, whose bullets have extremely destructive power; only when a ferocious beast is hit can it not hold on. If it is hit by bullets from a rifle or machine gun, it has the strength to counterattack. How does the human body compare to a cow? The tiger's force can kill a cow; if the human body touches its claws and teeth, it is bound to be seriously injured. After the tiger in Lishui was killed, it was made into a specimen and displayed in the West Lake Museum. I went to see it, and it was indeed very large.
    Fortunately, tigers rarely come out during the day. They are nocturnal. During the day, they lie in the jungle; in the evening, around five o'clock, they come out to find food to eat. It is said that in windy and rainy weather, they come out earlier; when they are hungry, they also come out to find food to eat during the day.
    Tigers have many martial skills; they can run, jump, and also swim and climb trees. Chinese people have long known that tigers can swim; they can cross fairly wide rivers, but their ability to climb trees has not been known. Fairy tales say that cats taught tigers the skills of pouncing and catching, but did not teach them how to climb trees. This is also a reflection of the old society's idea of ​​masters holding back on their disciples. In fact, tigers can climb trees, but they don't often use it; if there is a flood, they will climb into trees. Lions, however, definitely cannot climb trees.
    Although tigers are ferocious, their fur color is quite attractive, and everyone likes to watch them, but eating people is not good. Is it possible to not let them patrol in the mountains and forests and keep them locked up? This method is certainly good, but there is one problem that needs to be solved by scientists, namely the tiger's reproduction problem. Lions can still reproduce in cages, but tigers do not reproduce in cages, even if both male and female are together—at least that's what I know. It is speculated that the main reason is of course that living conditions have changed; but where is the reason, this needs to be explored by scientists. There is also a strange thing: under natural conditions, different species are not easy to mate and reproduce, but it becomes easier under domestication. Records show that there have been cases of female tigers and male lions producing small animals. But why doesn't the tiger's own species match up and become pregnant? (Attached picture)

　　说虎

    虎是著名凶猛的动物。古时候称猛将为虎将。今人称钳住有力量的大头钳子为老虎头钳。又，一般称捕食蝇的蜘蛛类动物为蝇虎、常在壁上巡行捕食小虫的蜥蜴类动物为壁虎。虎成为残杀活物的代表名词了。
    我小时候看过“小木头”戏（即木偶戏），有“打虎”一出，结果打虎者被虎囫囵吞下去；近年看到苏联艺术团的木偶戏中有“驯虎”，与前述的打虎相似，驯虎者也被虎囫囵吞下了事。俗语形容麻木无警觉的人是“老虎赶到屁股后头，还要看看它的雌雄”的人，都是描写老虎的厉害的。
    虎是爱吃鲜肉、喝鲜血的食肉兽，牛、猪、鹿等兽类都供它食用。它也吃雏鸡等鸟类。如到村落里来，则袭击家养的牛及猪等动物。农民知道老虎能口衔大猪跳过猪栏或短墙。农民只要看了猪在栏内被杀吃还是整个被拖去，便知道这袭击的强盗是狼还是虎了。
    虎的身体，大小与非洲狮大致相仿，两者都是著名的猛兽。但有的老练的动物学家推测，倘狮虎格斗起来，胜利可能落在虎一方面。古人（中西都是如此）认狮为兽中之王，多般因非洲雄狮有长鬣，披散在头侧，看去好像很威武的样子。但有理由使人觉得虎更强狠。
    虎的毛色无疑是很美丽的。一般是橙黄色，有黑条纹，亦有个体毛色很深，近乎黑色的，是为黑虎。又有很淡，近乎淡白色的，是为白虎，但很少见。中国古人不知道怎么一来，把这名称搞到星宿的名称上去了，例如说白虎星是一种凶神！
    虎大小亦不尽相同。东北虎（产兴安岭等处）大些，毛亦长些密些。福建虎较小，毛比较短。虎虽有一定产地，但又好游行。例如浙江省不是长期有虎，但有时突然有虎出现。绍兴的富城早先有虎，后来没有了。数年前丽水忽有大虎出现，初袭击家畜，后来有一天有一新娘婚后回母家去，途中被这大虫所吃掉。听说当时当地有若干武装士兵，为民除害、责无旁贷，遂去围攻。老虎是被打倒了，但士兵有数人负伤。闻一人死医院中，但确否未详。原来猎猛兽须用特制的猛兽枪，其子弹的破坏力极大，猛兽被击中才不能支持。如被步枪或机枪的子弹射中，它是有余力反扑的。人体比之于牛如何？虎的武力能击毙牛；人体如触着它的爪牙，分明是要受重伤的。丽水的虎打死后，做成标本，陈列在西湖博物馆里。我曾去看过，的确大得可以。
    好在虎白天很少出来。它是夜游者。白天卧在丛林中；傍晚，大约五点钟时分，它出来找食物吃了。据说，风雨天气，它出来的时间会早些；饥饿时，白天也会出来找食物吃。
    虎的武艺很多，能跑，能跳，还能游水和爬树。中国人早知道虎会游水，它能渡过相当阔的河，但爬树的本领没有被知道。童话故事中说，猫教虎扑物、捉物的本领，但没有教会它爬树。这也是旧社会里师父教徒弟留一手的思想的反映。实际上虎是会爬树的，只是不常用；如遇发洪水的时候，它会爬到树上去。狮子则的确是不会爬树的。
    老虎虽凶残，可是毛色颇好看，大家喜欢看，只是要吃人却不好。是不是可以不让它在山林中巡行，把它们关起来养着好不好呢？这办法当然是好的，只是有一问题须待科学家来解决，即老虎生育的问题。狮子在槛里还能生育，老虎在槛内就不生育，即使雌雄都在一起——至少我所知道的情况是如此。推测起来，主要当然由于生活条件起了变化；但是原因在哪里，这是须要科学家来摸索了。还有一件奇特的事情，在自然状况下面，异种是不易交配和生育的，在家养下面却变为较容易。记载上记有过雌虎和雄狮生产小动物的事。但为什么老虎本种相配倒不受孕了呢？（附图片）
