Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 12th: Liaoning Province's grain and cotton harvests this year have exceeded any previous year, reaching the planned production targets for 1957 ahead of schedule. The actual grain output of the province reached 7.6 million tons (including soybeans and potatoes), an increase of 23.3% over last year, exceeding the 1957 national planned production target by 19.3%. The actual cotton output reached 68,000 tons, more than double last year's output, also completing the Five-Year Plan's 1957 planned target one year ahead of schedule. In addition, the province's famous specialties such as tussah silkworm cocoons, apples, and flue-cured tobacco also achieved bumper harvests.

The reason why Liaoning Province's agricultural production was able to achieve such a large bumper harvest this year, in addition to favorable weather conditions conducive to crop growth, is mainly due to the great increase in rural productivity after the realization of advanced agricultural cooperation. Under the leadership of party and government departments at all levels, agricultural cooperatives in various regions carried out a large-scale agricultural technology reform movement, thus achieving an overall bumper harvest in agriculture.

After more than 98% of farmers in the province joined cooperatives this year, many agricultural construction projects that were difficult to carry out under individual and decentralized management in the past were undertaken. A total of more than 12,200 small reservoirs and ponds were built in the province, more than 8,700 large and small gravity irrigation projects were constructed, and many wells were also drilled. The irrigated area of the province has expanded by about 300,000 hectares compared to last year, and the rice planting area of the province has expanded by one and a half times compared to last year. New developments have also been made in flood control and drainage projects on both sides of rivers and water and soil conservation work in mountainous areas. The area of cultivated land severely reduced by floods in the province was reduced by more than half compared to last year. Many areas that suffered from floods in nine out of ten years also achieved bumper harvests this year.

On the basis of cooperation, the agricultural technology reform movement in the province has developed greatly this year. The area where base fertilizer was applied in the province increased by more than 15% compared to last year, and the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area also increased. Land preparation was also more meticulous than in the past, and seedling protection in spring was better than in previous years. In terms of cultivation methods, the area of "intercropping" promoted this year reached 170,000 hectares, most of which was potato intercropped with corn, which generally increased production by more than 50% compared to planting a single crop. Intercropping and mixed cropping of corn and soybeans are effective and inherent experience in increasing production for farmers in Liaoning Province. This year, with the expansion of the corn planting area, it has been widely adopted in various regions, and artificial auxiliary pollination has been implemented in half of the corn fields. In addition, the province has also reclaimed wasteland and eliminated boundary corners, expanding the cultivated area by 160,000 hectares and increasing grain production.

In order to rapidly increase the yield per unit area of ​​grain crops, the sown area of ​​high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and potatoes has increased by more than 600,000 hectares compared to last year. At the same time, the sown area of ​​improved varieties has also been further expanded. In the struggle to achieve bumper harvests, agricultural cooperatives in the province have received strong assistance from the Party and the state this year. This spring, the province held 13 short-term agricultural technology training classes, and cities and counties trained 300,000 technical backbones for agricultural cooperatives. State loans issued to support agricultural production amounted to more than 70 million yuan, more than double last year's figure.

Although the province has achieved unprecedented bumper harvests this year, according to relevant departments, due to the overly high production plan, excessive investment in agricultural capital construction, and excessive use of labor, the sideline income of farmers has decreased. In addition, in the promotion of agricultural technology, some areas blindly promoted it on a large scale regardless of conditions, resulting in reduced production.

### 实现高级合作化以后农村生产力大大提高  辽宁粮棉收成超过以往任何一年

    实现高级合作化以后农村生产力大大提高
    辽宁粮棉收成超过以往任何一年
    新华社沈阳12日电　辽宁省今年粮食和棉花的收成超过了以往任何一年，分别提前达到了1957年的计划生产指标。全省的粮食实际产量达到七百六十万吨（包括大豆和薯类），比去年增产23.3％，超过了1957年国家计划生产指标19.3％。棉花的实产量达到六万八千吨，比去年增产一倍多，也提前一年完成了五年计划规定的1957年计划指标。此外，这个省著名特产柞蚕茧、苹果和烤烟等也都获得了丰收。
    今年辽宁省的农业生产所以能够获得这样大的丰收，除了风调雨顺，有利于农作物的生长以外，最主要的原因是实现高级农业合作化以后，农村生产力得到极大的提高，各地农业社在各级党政部门的领导下，开展了大规模的农业技术改革运动，因而取得了农业的全面丰收。
    今年全省98％以上的农户加入合作社以后，举办了许多过去个体和分散经营时难于举办的农业建设工作。全省共修筑小型水库和塘坝一万二千二百多座，修筑大小自流灌溉工程八千七百多处，还打了很多水井。全省的灌溉面积比去年扩大了三十万公顷左右，全省水稻的种植面积比去年扩大了一倍半。河川两岸的防洪排涝工程和山区的水土保持工作，也有了新的发展。全省因水灾严重减产的耕地面积比去年约减少一半以上。许多十年九涝的地区今年也获得了丰收。
    在合作化的基础上，今年全省的农业技术改革运动有了很大的发展。全省施基肥的面积比去年增加了15％以上，单位面积的施肥量也有提高。整地也比过去细致，春季保苗比往年好。在栽培方法方面，今年推广“套种”的面积达到十七万公顷，其中大部分是土豆套玉米，普遍比种单一作物增产50％以上。玉米和大豆实行间作和混作，是辽宁省农民一项行之有效的固有增产经验，今年随着玉米种植面积的扩大，已被各地广泛采用，并有一半玉米田实行了人工辅助授粉，另外，全省还开垦荒地和消灭地界地角，扩大耕地面积十六万公顷，增加了粮食的产量。
    为了迅速提高粮食作物的单位面积产量，今年水稻、玉米和薯类等高产作物的播种面积比去年增加了六十多万公顷。同时，良种的播种面积也更加扩大了。这个省的农业社在争取丰收的斗争中，今年得到了党和国家的大力帮助。今春，省里举办的各种短期农业技术训练班有十三次，各市、县为农业社训练的技术骨干有三十万人。国家在扶助农业生产方面所发放的贷款达七千多万元，比去年增加两倍多。
    今年这个省虽然获得了空前丰收，但据有关部门说，由于生产计划偏高，农业基本建设投资过大和劳动力使用过多，使农民副业收入减少，再加在农业技术推广工作上，有些地区不顾条件的盲目大量推广，造成了减产。
