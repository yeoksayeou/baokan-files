Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 11th: Some National People's Congress representatives who are inspecting work in Zhejiang are contacting scientists and professors to understand the situation regarding scientific research and other aspects.

On December 7th, National People's Congress representatives Tong Dizhou, Zhao Zhongyao, Gu Gongxu, Zhang Yan, and Zhang Manjun invited more than 20 professors and scientists from four universities and colleges, including Zhejiang University and Zhejiang Agricultural College, and scientific research units such as the Zhejiang Provincial Health Experimental Institute, to a symposium. Many important opinions were raised at the meeting. Some professors said: Since the central government proposed the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, everyone has not yet debated well, and a very important reason is that many people still have ideological concerns. Zhejiang University Professor Zhang Shusen said: In the past few years, many senior intellectuals have reviewed the methods of academic research. This is certainly very necessary, but it has also produced some bad effects, making some experts not dare to put forward different opinions. Many attendees also suggested that young people engaged in scientific research and those engaged in practical scientific work should be given roughly the same encouragement and treatment, and that this is a principled issue in cultivating a new generation of scientific talent. Zhejiang Medical College Professor Cai Bao also said: Now many young people want to be graduate students, thinking that research work has a great future, and they do not like being teaching assistants or doctors. Even if they are appointed, they are often not at ease with their work. He hopes that the relevant departments will find ways to correct this situation, otherwise the teaching work will be greatly affected.

When talking about marching towards science, everyone believed that the main shortcoming at present is that there is more talk than action. The time, assistants, and necessary materials and equipment for research have not been well resolved. Professors and experts unanimously believe that marching towards science requires sufficient time, but the time taken up by meetings is still too much.

    在杭州视察的人民代表
    同教授和科学家举行座谈
    听取他们对科学研究工作的意见
    新华社杭州11日电　到浙江视察工作的一些全国人民代表大会代表正在同科学家和教授们接触，了解科学研究等方面的情形。
    12月7日，全国人民代表大会代表童第周、赵忠尧、顾功叙、张岩和张曼筠等邀请在杭州的浙江大学、浙江农学院等四个高等学校和浙江省卫生实验院等科学研究单位的教授与科学家二十多人座谈。会上提出了许多重要意见。一些教授说：中央提出“百家争鸣”的方针以后，到现在大家还没有很好地争鸣起来，其中很重要的原因是不少人思想上还有顾虑。浙江大学教授张树森说：几年来有不少高级知识分子对学术研究的方法作过检讨，这当然是很必要的，但也产生一些不好的作用，使一部分专家不大敢提出不同的见解。不少到会者还提出，应该对从事科学研究和从事实际科学工作的青年给以大体相同的鼓励和待遇的意见，并且认为这是一个在培养青年一代科学人才方面带有方针性的问题。浙江医学院教授蔡堡还说：现在许多青年都希望当研究生，认为研究工作前途大，不喜欢当助教、当医师。有的即使担任了，也往往不安心工作。他希望有关方面设法改正这种情况，否则教学方面的工作将会受到很大影响。
    谈到向科学进军的问题时，大家认为当前主要的缺点是谈得多，做得少。关于研究的时间、助手和必需的资料、仪器设备等都没有很好解决。教授和专家们一致认为：向科学进军需要有足够的时间，而目前被开会占去的时间仍是太多了。
