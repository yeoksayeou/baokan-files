    International Snippets

    Increasing Number of Japanese Prostitutes
    According to recent statistics from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, as of September this year, the total number of public and private prostitutes in Japan reached 148,662. Among them, the number of public prostitutes in "red-light districts" has decreased from 59,018 to 54,578, but the number of private prostitutes in "blue-light districts" has increased by 50%, from 25,449 to 40,129.

    U.S. Military Psychological Problems
    The U.S. Army's Seventh Corps in Europe recently announced that 1% of its officers and soldiers require psychological treatment each year. The conditions of these soldiers are widespread, ranging from ordinary psychological disorders to severe mental illnesses, and 5% to 6% of them suffer from mental illness.

    Ku Klux Klan Activities
    The Ku Klux Klan in Montgomery, Alabama, USA, has recently stepped up its activities. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on November 13 that the racial segregation system on buses in Montgomery was unconstitutional. Subsequently, on the evening of November 25, dozens of KKK members in white robes appeared on the streets of the city. Afterwards, about five hundred KKK members in white robes held a meeting in the suburbs to express their opposition to racial integration and the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling.

    国际点滴
    日本私娼增多
    日本厚生省最近统计，截至今年9月为止，日本公私娼妓共达十四万八千六百六十二人。其中在“红灯区”的公娼已从五万九千零十八人减少至五万四千五百七十八人，可是在“蓝灯区”的私娼却增加了50％，人数从二万五千四百四十九人增加到四万零一百二十九人。
    美军的心理病
    据最近驻欧洲的美国陆军第七军宣布，该军每年有1％的官兵必须受心理治疗。这些官兵的病况很广泛，有普通的心理失常有严重的精神变态，还有5％到6％的人患了精神病。
    三K党的活动
    美国亚拉巴马州蒙哥马利城的三K党最近又大肆活动了。美国最高法院在11月13日曾经裁决说，蒙哥马利城实行的公共汽车种族隔离制度是违反美国宪法的。接着，在11月25日晚上，在这个城市的大街上就出现了几十名身穿白袍的三K党人。之后，约有五百名身穿白袍的三K党人在郊外开会，表示反对种族混合和美国最高法院的裁决。
