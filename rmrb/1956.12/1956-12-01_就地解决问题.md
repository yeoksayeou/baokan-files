　　Solving Problems On the Spot
    Lower-level cadres greatly welcome the arrival of leading cadres. However, not all leading cadres who go down to the lower levels are welcomed.

    Some leading cadres, after going down, only convene meetings, listen to reports, and urge the submission of various investigation and statistical materials. They spend most of their time still in meetings and looking at materials. As a result, they are still rushed and only scratch the surface. They do not go deep; they merely skim over the surface.

    Some leading cadres take a completely opposite approach when they go down. They seek to find problems. Once problems are found, if they can be solved on the spot, they consult with lower-level cadres, find ways to solve them on the spot, and in the process of discovering and solving problems, improve the working ability of lower-level cadres and boost their confidence. The inspection groups organized by the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee delve deeply into the grassroots in this way. Such depth will surely be welcomed by lower-level cadres. Because, if problems are solved on the spot, it saves lower-level cadres from traveling long distances and writing many reports to request instructions from higher authorities. Moreover, understanding the situation on the spot and discussing it with lower-level cadres can reduce subjectivity and one-sidedness when solving problems.

　　就地解决问题
    下级干部很欢迎领导干部下去。可是，并不是所有到下边去的领导干部都能受到欢迎。
    有些领导干部到下边去以后，只是召开会议，听取汇报，催要各种各样的调查统计材料。他们大部分时间仍是开会和看材料。结果还是急急忙忙，走马看花。他们并没有深入下去，只是轻飘飘地在下面滑了过去。
    有些领导干部下去以后的作法完全相反。他们要去寻找问题。问题找了出来，只要能够就地解决的，就和下级干部商量，想办法就地解决，而且在发现问题和解决问题当中提高下级干部的工作能力，鼓舞他们的信心。山西省委和省人民委员会组织的视察团就是这样深入基层的。这样的深入一定会受到下级干部的欢迎。因为，问题就地解决了，就省得下级干部跑很多路写许多报告去向上级请示，而且，就地了解情况，和下级干部一起商量，还可以减少解决问题时的主观性和片面性。
