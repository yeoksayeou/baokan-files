　　Anglo-French Aggression Inflicts Suffering on Western European Countries
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 30th—News: The oil shortage brought about by the war of aggression against Egypt is causing Britain to face the prospect of increased unemployment.

    The Jaguar car company has announced that its large factory in Coventry is now only working four days a week, the first time the company has ever done so.

    Many other businesses are also attempting to cope with the production cuts caused by the oil crisis by shortening the work week and reducing wages.

    At the same time, according to newspaper reports, workers in many enterprises are demanding higher wages due to the rise in the cost of living caused by the aggression against Egypt. The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, representing 84,000 members of the union, has also demanded a wage increase.

    Xinhua News Agency, 30th—France began implementing gasoline rationing on the 29th. Trucks are only allocated 40 to 50 liters per month, cars 30 liters, and mopeds 10 liters.

    The Danish government announced the implementation of an oil rationing system starting on the 29th. Private cars are allocated 55 liters of gasoline every six weeks.

    Xinhua News Agency, 30th—According to TASS, Rome, 30th—"Unità" reports that the consequences of Anglo-French aggression against Egypt are increasingly and significantly affecting the Italian economy. The newspaper says that the cost of living has generally risen due to the increase in the price of gasoline and coal.
