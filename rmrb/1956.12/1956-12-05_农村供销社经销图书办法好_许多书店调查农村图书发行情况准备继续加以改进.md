Xinhua News Agency, December 4th: The rural supply and marketing cooperative's method of distributing books is a good way to improve rural book distribution work. In the past month or so, the Xinhua Bookstore main store sent three work teams to rural areas in more than ten counties in three provinces to investigate this new business situation.

According to the investigation, since rural supply and marketing cooperatives began establishing book distribution businesses in the spring of this year, popular reading materials have been able to reach farmers in a timely manner. Currently, in Liaoning Province, in addition to the Xinhua Bookstore, there are more than two thousand township stores and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives selling books. Some townships have a place to buy books every five or six *li*. From May to October, the sales volume of books in rural areas throughout Liaoning Province was twice as high as when the Xinhua Bookstore made mobile supplies to the countryside during the same period last year. The book sales volume of the Yuanjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hunan Province from March to September was more than three times higher than the same period last year. Many supply and marketing cooperatives also send salespersons to agricultural production cooperatives to provide mobile book supplies and hold small book exhibitions when there are meetings in rural areas. This work is very popular among farmers. A number of advanced workers have emerged in the work of rural supply and marketing cooperatives in the business of selling books.

These work teams also investigated the books needed by rural readers. Farmers in various places have reflected that they do not like to read books that talk about grand principles, and they need reading materials that can practically solve agricultural production problems. In a township in Taojiang County, Hunan Province, an agricultural production cooperative operated according to the method proposed in the book "How to Prevent Rice Seedling Rot," and prevented seedling rot. The remaining ten cooperatives did not buy this book, and as a result, the rice seedlings all rotted. The person in charge of the Yiyang County Agriculture Bureau told the work team members that there is a lot of repetition in the content of rural reading materials, and it is not easy to find books that can solve agricultural production problems. There are a large number of shells on the shores of Dongting Lake, and farmers spontaneously burn them into ash as fertilizer. People suspect whether the phosphorus in the shells is burned off, but they cannot find a book to solve this problem. Rural primary and secondary schools generally report that they cannot buy extracurricular literature reading materials.

The Xinhua Bookstore main store is studying the investigation materials of these three work teams in order to further improve rural book distribution work.

　　农村供销社经销图书办法好
　　许多书店调查农村图书发行情况准备继续加以改进
    新华社4日讯　农村供销合作社经销图书是改进农村图书发行工作的好办法。新华书店总店在最近一个多月中，派出三个工作组到三个省十多个县的农村里调查了这项新的业务情况。
    据调查，农村供销合作社从今年春季开始建立图书发行业务以来，通俗读物能够及时送到农民手里。现在，辽宁省除新华书店外，已有二千多个乡商店、基层供销合作社经销书籍，有些乡相距五、六里就有一个卖书的地方。辽宁全省从5月到10月在农村里的售书量比去年同时期新华书店到农村流动供应时增加了一倍。湖南省沅江县供销合作社从3月到9月的图书销售量比去年同时期增加了三倍多。许多供销合作社还派营业员到农业生产合作社里流动供应图书，遇到农村开会就举办小型书籍展览。这些工作很受农民欢迎。各地农村供销合作社在经售图书的工作中已经出现了一批先进工作者。
    这些工作组也调查了农村读者需要书籍的情况。各地农民都反映不爱看讲大道理的书，需要切实能解决农业生产问题的读物。湖南省桃江县一个乡有个农业生产合作社根据“怎样防止烂秧”一书提出的办法进行操作，就防止了烂秧。其余十个社未买到这本书，结果水稻都烂了秧。益阳县农业局负责人对工作组人员说，农村读物内容重复多，不容易找到能解决农业生产问题的书。洞庭湖边有大量贝壳，农民自发地把它烧成灰作肥料。人们怀疑贝壳中的磷是否被烧掉，却找不到一本书能解决这个问题。农村中小学普遍反映买不到课外文学读物。
    新华书店总店正研究这三个工作组的调查材料，以便进一步改进农村图书发行工作。
