"Refugees," "Stubborn People," and "Docile People"
Ping Xin

While openly and covertly the aggression experts were murdering Egypt using different methods, they placed great expectations on the fascist restoration in Hungary. As everyone has seen, their restoration dream shattered in an instant, leaving only an embarrassing memory of initial sweetness followed by bitterness. From ecstasy to sorrow, from full of hope to utter despair, from confident command to utter bewilderment, this kind of rise and fall, like a yellow millet dream, cannot be depicted by any painter. At this moment, all we can "appreciate" is their extremely awkward post-dream visage.

Now, while pouring dirty water on the Soviet Union for helping the Hungarian people extinguish the fascist flames, they are vainly attempting to ignite new will-o'-the-wisps in Hungary. As reported on November 11, at the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting, the US representative and his echo chambers proposed "implementing relief for Hungary," while British representative Dixon said in his speech that the Queen's government was making arrangements to accommodate 2,500 Hungarian "refugees" in Britain. As reported on November 23, at the United Nations General Assembly, the United States, Argentina, and four other countries re-submitted a proposal to "care for" Hungarian "refugees" abroad.

We are not unfamiliar with the United States' "relief for allies" and the United Kingdom and the United States' "accommodating refugees" or "caring for refugees." Everyone will not forget the astonishing amount of "relief supplies" that the United States allocated to the Nanjing puppet regime eight or nine years ago, which turned to ashes in the blink of an eye (until now, there are still so-called "US Aid agencies" in Taiwan), nor will they forget the "refugee camps" established by the United Kingdom seven years ago in Hong Kong's "Hangman's Hill" [1], which were still "performing meritorious service" in the Kowloon riots last month, nor will they forget the United States' "caring for" "high-level refugees" such as Viktor Kravchenko [2].

Just as Soviet Foreign Minister Shepilov exposed: "The Hungarian 'refugees' mentioned by the imperialists are actually those fascist bandits who fled abroad after committing heinous crimes against the Hungarian people, most of whom were fascist elements who entered Hungary in the first few days of the rebellion" (see People's Daily, November 23). The reason why Western gamblers are particularly fond of Hungarian "refugees" is obviously because this group of "refugees" can be used at any time as chips for their wanton gambling on the international casino.

However, on the very day that the Hungarian fascist restoration tragedy came to a dismal end, in London, more than 10,000 people protesting the war of aggression against Egypt poured into Whitehall, chanting "Eden must go." In France, a struggle against the invasion of Algeria and Egypt was also launched. In the United States, even though the reactionary forces suppressing the masses are very fierce, many people have expressed sympathy for the invaded countries in various ways, protested against the armed aggression by Britain and France, and expressed dissatisfaction with the Eisenhower administration's double-dealing. This shows that in these so-called civilized countries, many ordinary people cannot suppress their anger at the war of aggression and colonialism. From the bloodshot eyes of the big and small imperialist bullies, they can be said to be very annoying "stubborn people." This kind of "stubborn people" not only want to meddle in world affairs, but also constantly oppose the rich and stingy bosses for the sake of their livelihood. The steelworkers' strike that broke out in the United States in July this year is a notable example that shook the capitalist crust.

"Stubborn people" and "refugees" arouse the Western "great benefactors'" aversion and goodwill respectively, and they receive vastly different treatment, which is "perfectly natural."

Due to their dislike of "stubborn people" and pity for "refugees," the logical development of the Western "great benefactors'" feelings will inevitably lead to a love of "docile people."

From the perspective of the interests of European and American knights and bosses, there are three most important things. These are: actively suppressing and eliminating "stubborn people" at home and abroad, enthusiastically rescuing and training "refugees" abroad, and massively cultivating and educating "docile people" at home and abroad. Driving "stubborn people" into concentration camps, inviting "refugees" into refugee camps, and incorporating "docile people" into military barracks and cultural forbidden camps, this is Hitler's "rule of ultimate goodness" and "benevolent governance" recorded in history. The gentlemen and wealthy merchants of the United States, Britain, and France are trying to inherit Hitler's established methods and are vigorously encouraging the Bonn Junkers to revive the Nazi family reputation. It is only because of various historical constraints and mass pressure that they cannot go all out like Hitler, which is their profound distress.

What makes these gentlemen most heartbroken is that, looking around, the number of "docile people" is decreasing, while the number of "stubborn people" is increasing. One day, an awakening and huge cry will erupt from the military barracks and forbidden camps of "docile people," converging with the roar of the vast "stubborn people" to become an unstoppable torrent of rebellion. At that time, the accommodators will become the accommodated, just as the attackers will become the attacked. And what is even more heartbreaking is that, on that unimaginable unfortunate day, it will not be easy to find a quiet place on Earth to establish "refugee camps."

From various signs, it can be seen that the heroes who are plotting to murder peace already have this ominous premonition.

If the Western gentlemen, who are "civilized to the extreme" and "armed to the teeth," are unwilling to give up their extraordinarily proud "civilian and military achievements," their ominous premonition turning into a tragic reality will not be too far away. For the sake of their future destiny, they should "prepare for a rainy day" and take the time to explore the moon to arrange a blessed land for "refugee camps" in advance. Although it is "unbearably cold at high altitudes," it is better than being caught off guard. And according to reports, the United States has already seen the emergence of a novel business of selling lunar "land," which is very timely.

    “难民”“顽民”和“顺民”
    平心
    公开的和伪装的侵略专家在用不同手法谋杀埃及的时候，曾把很大的期望寄托在匈牙利的法西斯复辟上。像大家所看到的，他们的复辟好梦一刹那间就破灭了，只剩下一段先甜后苦的难堪回忆。从狂喜到哀愁，从满怀希望到全盘绝望，从指挥若定到手足失措，这种类乎黄粱梦的枕上沧桑，是任何画工描摹不出来的。此刻我们所能“欣赏”的，是他们的极其尴尬的梦余嘴脸。
    现在，他们一面在向援助匈牙利人民扑灭法西斯凶焰的苏联大泼污水，一面妄想在匈牙利煽起新的鬼火。11月11日报载，在联合国大会紧急会议上，美国代表和他的应声虫提出了对匈牙利“实施救济的问题”，而英国代表狄克逊在发言中说女王政府正在进行安排收容二千五百个匈牙利“难民”到英国去。11月23日报载，在联合国大会上美国、阿根廷等四国又重新提出了对匈牙利在国外的“难民”予以“照顾”的提案。
    提起美国的“救济盟友”和英美等国的“收容难民”或“照顾难民”，我们是一点不感到陌生的。大家不会忘记，八、九年前美国拨交南京小朝廷转眼就化为灰烬的数量大得惊人的“救济物资”（直到现在，台湾还有所谓“美援机构”），也不会忘记英国七年前在香港“吊颈岭”〔一〕设立的直到上个月还在九龙暴乱中“立功”的“难民营”，更不会忘记美国
  “照顾”维克多·克拉夫钦哥〔二〕之类的“高等难民”。
    正像苏联外交部长谢皮洛夫所揭穿的：帝国主义分子所说的“匈牙利‘难民’实际上是那些在对匈牙利人民犯了滔天罪行以后逃到国外的法西斯匪帮，其中大部分是在叛乱的头几天进入匈牙利的法西斯分子”
  （见11月23日人民日报）。西方赌棍们之所以特别垂青匈牙利的“难民”，显然是因为这一帮“难民”可以随时做他们在国际赌场上恣意豪赌的筹码。
    然而就在匈牙利法西斯复辟悲剧惨然谢幕的那一天，在伦敦有一万多反对侵埃战争的群众涌进白厅大道，高呼“艾登必须滚蛋”。在法国也先后掀起了反对进攻阿尔及利亚和埃及的斗争。在美国，即令压制群众的反动力量非常凶狠，也有不少人用各种方式表示同情被侵略国，抗议英法的武装侵略，不满艾森豪威尔政府的两面派做法。这就看得出，在这些所谓文明国家里，正有不少老百姓无法压制自己对侵略战争和殖民主义的愤怒。从帝国主义大小霸王的充血眼睛看来，他们可以说是十分讨厌的“顽民”，这一类的“顽民”，不但要过问天下事，为了吃饭问题，还要不断跟阔气而又悭吝的大老板作对。今年7月间，美国爆发的钢铁工人大罢工，就是震动资本主义地壳的一个显著事例。
      “顽民”和“难民”分别引起了西方“大善士”的恶感和好感，他们受到苦乐悬殊的待遇，正是“顺理成章”的。
    由于讨厌“顽民”，怜恤“难民”，西方“大善士”们的感情发展逻辑，必然归结到喜爱“顺民”。
    从欧美爵士和老板的利益来说，最重要的事有三件。这就是积极镇压和消灭国内和国外的“顽民”，热心救济和训练国外的“难民”，大量培养和教化国内和国外的“顺民”。把“顽民”赶入集中营，把“难民”请入难民营，把“顺民”分别编入武的兵营和文的禁营，这是载在史册的希特勒的“郅治”与“德政”。美、英、法的绅士和豪商正想继承希特勒的成法，并且极力鼓励波恩戎客们重振纳粹家声。只是由于受到种种的历史束缚和群众压力，他们不能像希特勒那样放手大干，这却是他们的深重苦闷。
    最使这些老爷们伤心的是，环顾四面八方，“顺民”的数目是越来越少，而“顽民”的数目却越来越多。总有一天，从“顺民”的兵营和禁营里发出觉醒的巨大呐喊，和广大“顽民”的怒吼汇合，成为无法阻挡的叛逆洪流。到了那时，收容者就将要变成被收容者，正如打击者将要变成被打击者。而更可伤心的是，在那个不堪设想的倒霉日子，地球上将不容易找到设立“难民营”的清静所在。
    从种种迹象可以看出，谋杀和平的英豪们已经有了这种不祥的预感。
    假如“文明到极境”、“武装到牙齿”的西方老爷们，不甘放弃得意非凡的“文治武功”，他们的不祥预感变为惨厉的现实是不会太远的。为了他们的未来命运设想，他们倒是应该“未雨绸缪”，趁早到月球上勘探预先安排“难民营”的福地，虽然是“高处不胜寒”，总比临时措手不及好得多。而据报载，前些时美国已经出现了发售月球“地皮”的新奇买卖，真是及时得很。
