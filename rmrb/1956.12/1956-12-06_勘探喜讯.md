　  From the 20 Drill Wells in the Qaidam Basin, Oil is Flowing
　  Xinhua News Agency, Mang'ai, December 5th (Reporter Peng Lei) reports: Good news of oil production from drill wells in the Qaidam Basin, Qinghai Province, is coming one after another from various exploration areas. In November alone, seven drill wells gushed or flowed crude oil. Up to now, a total of twenty wells in the basin have produced crude oil.

　  The oil testing situation in the Youquanzi and Lenghu exploration areas is getting better and better, and the oil production of several exploration wells has increased by two or three times compared with the initial test. The oil layers in these two exploration areas are shallow, the pressure is high, and they can self-spray. The quality of the oil is better than that of the Laojunmiao in Yumen. Now, it is certain that these two exploration areas have industrial production value.
　  A New Coalfield of 400 Square Kilometers Discovered in Liaoning
　  This newspaper, Shenyang, December 4th: An area of about 400 square kilometers of a new coalfield has been discovered underground within the borders of Tieling and Faku counties, 75 kilometers away from Shenyang. The new coalfield was confirmed by the First Geological Exploration Bureau of the Northeast Coalfield after preliminary investigation, based on the scientific arguments of Soviet experts and the fact that local farmers dug up coal seedlings from wells. According to existing exploration data, the boundary of the new coalfield is likely to extend northward to Kaiyuan and Changtu counties. Exploration work is continuing and expanding. The coal in the new coalfield is long-flame coal, suitable for industrial power. From a core taken from a borehole 300 meters deep, there is a cumulative thickness of 14 meters of coal seams, each layer being 1 to 3 meters thick, which is determined to be of mining value. More importantly, it is close to industrial areas such as Shenyang and Anshan, providing a new source of power for the further development of coastal industries in Liaoning. The First Geological Exploration Bureau has concentrated more than 1,000 people since July this year, using new electrical exploration technology, and the work is progressing rapidly. The western and southern edges of the coalfield have now been identified. Next year, they will continue to explore in the east and north to determine the maximum boundary of the coalfield.

　  柴达木盆地已经有二十口钻井流出油
    据新华社茫崖5日电　新华社记者彭雷报道：青海省柴达木盆地钻井出油的好消息一个接着一个从各探区传来。仅在11月份内，就有七口钻井喷出或流出原油。截至现在为止，全盆地已经有二十口井钻出了原油。
    油泉子和冷湖两个探区的试油情况越来越好，有几口探井的出油量比初试的时候增加了两三倍。这两个探区的油层浅，压力大，能够自喷，油的质量都比玉门老君庙的好。现在，这两个探区已经肯定有工业生产价值。
　  辽宁发现一个四百平方公里的新煤田
    本报沈阳4日电　在距离沈阳七十五公里的铁岭、法库两县境内的地下，发现一座面积约四百平方公里的新煤田。新煤田是根据苏联专家的科学论断，和当地农民掘井挖出煤苗的事实，由东北煤田第一地质勘探局预查之后证实的。根据已有的勘探资料，新煤田的疆界，很可能向北延伸到开原、昌图两县境内，目前勘探工作正在继续进行和扩大。新煤田的煤，是适于工业动力用的长焰煤。从一个打进三百公尺深的钻孔里取出的岩芯来看，已有累计十四公尺厚的煤层，每层厚度一至三公尺，判定有开采价值。更重要的是它靠近沈阳、鞍山等工业区，为辽宁一带沿海工业的进一步发展，又提供了新的动力来源。第一地质勘探局从今年7月起，集中了一千多人，采用新的电法勘探技术，工作进展很快。现在已经摸清了煤田的西、南两面的边缘。明年，他们将继续向东、北两方面进行勘探，以便查明煤田的最大疆界。　　（辽宁日报）
