Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 22nd. The Indonesian Cabinet held an emergency meeting last night to discuss the military rebellion in Central Sumatra.

　　Information Minister Sudibjo told reporters after the meeting that civil and military authorities would be sent to Central Sumatra to investigate the situation there as a first step in finding a solution to the problem.

　　Army Chief of Staff Nasution also attended the meeting. The cabinet held another emergency meeting at noon today to discuss the situation in Central Sumatra.

　　According to Jakarta newspapers on the 21st, a group of retired officers from the former Banteng Division seized the Central Sumatra provincial government on the 20th. Governor Mulyohardjo (a member of the Masyumi Party) has handed over his government apparatus to a "Military Committee" headed by Lieutenant Colonel Ahmad Hussein.

　　The Banteng Division was an army unit during the Indonesian revolution and was disbanded a long time ago. The defense of this division in Central Sumatra has been taken over by the Bukit Barisan Division of the First Military District, commanded by Colonel Simbolon. However, a group of retired Banteng Division personnel formed their own group and continued to actively engage in political activities. Last month, Banteng Division personnel held a "reunion" in Padang, where a resolution was passed calling for "thorough reforms" in Indonesia. Colonel Simbolon also attended the conference.

　　Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo met with President Sukarno at the Independence Palace on the 21st, presumably to discuss the Central Sumatra incident. The Prime Minister told the press on the same day that regarding the Central Sumatra incident, "if the news is true, then the situation is indeed serious."

　　After receiving news of the military rebellion in Central Sumatra on the morning of the 21st, the Central Committee of the Masyumi Party immediately held a meeting with its ministers.

　　According to Indonesian news agency reports, some leaders of the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association believe that the only person capable of dealing with the current situation is Dr. Hatta, who recently resigned.

　　Meanwhile, Antara News Agency reported today that Mochtar Lubis, editor-in-chief of "Indonesia Raya," was arrested by military police on the 21st. It is believed that his arrest is related to the failed coup attempt by former Deputy Army Chief of Staff Zulkifli Lubis.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 22nd. Simbolon, commander of the First Military District, announced today that he has taken over the government of North Sumatra Province. He declared that he does not recognize the current cabinet and that he is severing all relations with the central government from today.

　　Simbolon's announcement was made through Medan Radio Station at 8:00 a.m. today.

　　The announcement also stated that North Sumatra has declared a state of emergency under military law.

　　Simbolon's announcement stated that if a satisfactory new government is formed to replace the current government, they can restore relations with the new central government.

　　Central Sumatra Province, which launched a military coup on the 20th, also belongs to the First Military District.

    苏门答腊中部和北部两省发生军事叛变
    印度尼西亚政府开紧急会议讨论对策
    新华社雅加达22日电　印度尼西亚内阁昨天晚上举行紧急会议讨论中苏门答腊的军事叛变。
    情报部长苏迪比约在会后告诉记者们，将派遣民政和军事当局人员前往中苏门答腊调查那里的情况，作为设法解决这个问题的第一个步骤。
    陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安也参加了这次会议。今天中午，内阁再次举行紧急会议，讨论中苏门答腊局势。
    据雅加达报纸21日报道说，前雄牛师的一批退伍军官20日夺取了中苏门答腊省政府。省长穆尔约哈约（马斯友美党人）已经把他的政府机构交给了以艾哈迈德·侯赛尼中校为首的“军事委员会”。
    雄牛师是印度尼西亚革命时期的一支陆军部队，好久以前就已经被解散。这个师在中苏门答腊的防务已经由西姆波朗上校所统率的第一军区的丘陵演习师所接管。但是雄牛师的一批退伍人员自成一个集团，继续积极从事政治活动。上月间，雄牛师人员在巴东举行了“团聚会”，会上通过决议，要求在印度尼西亚实行“彻底的改革”。西姆波朗上校也出席了这次大会。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理21日在独立宫同苏加诺总统会谈，预料是在讨论中苏门答腊事件，总理同一天对报界说，关于中苏门答腊事件“如果消息属实，那么形势确实是严重的”。
    马斯友美党中央委员会21日上午接到中苏门答腊发生军事叛变的消息以后，立即与它的部长们举行会议。
    据印度尼西亚新闻社消息，马斯友美党和印度尼西亚伊斯兰教师联合会的某些领导人认为，唯一能够对付目前局势的人只有最近辞职的哈达博士。
    同时，安塔拉通讯社今天报道，“大印度尼西亚报”总编辑莫奇塔尔·卢比斯已经在21日被宪兵逮捕。人们相信，他所以被捕是同前陆军副参谋长佐基夫利·卢比斯的政变未遂案有关。
    新华社雅加达22日电　第一军区司令西姆波朗今天宣布接管北苏门答腊省政权。他声明不承认现内阁，并且从今天起断绝与中央政府的一切关系。
    西姆波朗的公告是今天早晨八点钟通过棉兰广播电台宣布的。
    公告还说，苏门答腊北部已经宣布处于危急的军事戒严状态中。
    西姆波朗的公告认为，如果成立一个合意的新政府来代替现在的政府，他们就可以同这个新的中央政府恢复关系。
    在20日发动军事政变的中苏门答腊省也属于第一军区。
