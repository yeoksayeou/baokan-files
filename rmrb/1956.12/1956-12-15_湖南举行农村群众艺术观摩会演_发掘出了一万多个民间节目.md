    Hunan Holds Rural Mass Art Performance
    Discovering Over Ten Thousand Folk Programs

    (Our Newspaper News) The 1956 Hunan Province Rural Mass Art Performance Conference concluded on the 7th of this month. The performance lasted eighteen days, with two hundred and thirteen programs presented. The conference selected one hundred and twenty-one excellent programs. Among them, sixty programs received performance awards, forty-two veteran artists received certificates, two hundred and ninety-four people received first, second, and third-class actor awards respectively, three orchestras received music accompaniment awards, and over twenty programs have been selected for film adaptation.

    Participants in the performance included Han, Miao, Yao, Dong, Hui, and Tujia nationalities, totaling four hundred and nine performers. Among them, sixty-two were minority nationality actors, who brought many wonderful programs, such as the "Dragon Dance" and "Drum Dance" from the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, the "Sanbang Drum" (Hui nationality) from Changde Prefecture, the "Fishing Dance" and "Long Drum Dance" (Yao nationality) from Chenxian Prefecture, and the "Chicken Fight" (Dong nationality) from Qianyang Prefecture.

    Through this performance, the ideological and professional level of the artists has been raised, and a large number of excellent programs have been discovered. A total of three hundred and eighty-six different forms of folk art and over ten thousand programs have been discovered throughout the province. Many of these were on the verge of being lost. For example, the "Missing Love Ghost Song," which won a performance award, had been lost for more than twenty years, and only the veteran artist Yang Hechun from Liling County knew how to sing it. The "Wen Chadeng" in Fenghuang County had not been performed for thirty or forty years. A large number of outstanding artists emerged during the performance, expanding the art ranks. Participants in the performance included veteran artists in their seventies and eighties, as well as young piano players under the age of seven. The veteran artist Yang Meisheng from Qiyang County is seventy-nine years old. He has mastered the traditional national vocalization methods, can sing clear falsetto, and has in-depth research on vocalization issues. These veteran artists have been greatly encouraged by participating in this performance and expressed their willingness to pass on the programs they know to the younger generation.

    湖南举行农村群众艺术观摩会演
    发掘出了一万多个民间节目
    本报讯　湖南省1956年农村群众艺术观摩会演大会已于本月7日闭幕。这次会演历时十八天，演出二百十三个节目。大会评选出一百二十一个优秀节目。其中有六十个节目得到演出奖，有四十二个老艺人得到奖状，还有二百九十四人分别获得演员一、二、三等奖，有三个乐队得到音乐伴奏奖，有二十多个节目已决定拍成电影。
    参加这次会演的有汉、苗、瑶、侗、回和土家六个民族，共有演员四百零九人。其中少数民族演员有六十二人，他们带来了许多精彩节目，如湘西苗族自治州的“接龙舞”和“鼓舞”，常德专区的“三棒鼓”（回族），郴县专区的“钓鱼舞”和“长鼓舞”（瑶族），黔阳专区的“鸡打架”（侗族）等。
    通过这次会演，提高了艺人的思想业务水平，发掘了大批优秀节目。全省共发掘出三百八十六种不同的民间艺术形式和一万多个节目。其中有很多是快要失传了的，如获得演出奖的“思情鬼歌”已失传二十多年，只有醴陵县老艺人杨和春一个人会唱，凤凰县的“文茶灯”也有三四十年没演了。会演中涌现了大批优秀艺人，扩大了艺术队伍。参加会演的有七八十岁的老艺人，也有不到七岁的小琴手。祁阳县老艺人杨梅生已七十九岁，他掌握了民族传统的发声方法，能唱出清亮的侧声来，对发声问题也有深刻研究。这些老艺人都因参加这次演出而得到很大鼓舞，表示愿意将自己知道的节目传授给青年一代。
