    Strictly Conserving Timber

    Since the second quarter of this year, the contradiction between timber production and supply has become increasingly prominent. First, demand exceeded supply, and later, serious shortages occurred. The most acutely lacking materials are special-purpose timber such as railroad ties for laying railways, pit props for coal mining, and utility poles for erecting telegraph and telephone networks. Other materials, such as those used in papermaking, shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, building houses, and manufacturing agricultural tools and furniture, also fall far short of demand. Obviously, if this problem is not properly resolved, it will not only affect the development of our national construction, but also affect the satisfaction of people's daily needs.

    There are usually two ways to solve this problem. One is to accelerate the progress of the forest harvesting industry and increase timber production. The other is to vigorously practice economy according to the principle of conservation and reduce timber consumption as much as possible.

    Judging from our country's forest resources, relying solely on the former method is not feasible. It is well known that our country's forest resources are insufficient. According to preliminary surveys, excluding remote areas in the southwest such as Kangding and Tibet, the total forest stock is approximately 5 billion cubic meters, which is only one-tenth of the total forest stock in the Soviet Union. With the development of national construction, the demand for timber is increasing. If we take the timber production in 1950 as 100, it had already reached 439.8 in 1954. This year, timber production has reached the level of the 1957 national plan, but it is still not enough. Industrial construction will further increase during the Second Five-Year Plan, and the demand for timber will naturally increase accordingly. Due to the insufficiency of our country's forest resources, we cannot harvest excessive amounts of timber every year without limit, but can only reasonably increase a certain amount of harvesting. On the other hand, our timber utilization rate is very low. Due to the underdevelopment of our country's forest chemical industry, coupled with the fact that timber-using units have many unresolved problems in timber processing, a large number of tree branches, bark, tops, side cuts, wood chips, and shavings cannot be fully utilized. According to calculations by the Ministry of Forestry, only 27% of current forest resources can be utilized. The average utilization of logs is only 50% (advanced countries have already utilized more than 80%-90%), which means that half is used and half is discarded. Some timber-using units can only utilize 20%-30% of logs, which means that only a small portion is used, and a large portion is discarded.

    From the above basic situation, it is necessary to appropriately accelerate the development of the forest harvesting industry to increase timber production. However, if we rely solely on increasing timber production to solve the timber shortage, it will lead to the disastrous result of the gradual depletion of forest resources. From a long-term perspective, the most fundamental solution to the timber problem is to vigorously develop afforestation. However, the growth of trees is not a matter of three or five years. Even the most common poplar trees need more than 20 years to be usable, and more valuable trees take 40 to 50 years or even about 100 years to mature. Therefore, the key to solving the current timber shortage lies in all timber-using units strictly adhering to the principle of conservation, vigorously promoting advanced experiences in saving timber, fully utilizing substitutes, and minimizing timber consumption.

    Many timber-using units have also given a certain degree of importance to saving timber. For example, match factories have shortened the length of matchsticks, which alone can save more than 20,000 cubic meters of timber annually. Engineering construction units are widely adopting cement floors and vigorously promoting the experience of using bamboo instead of timber for scaffolding. The proportion of papermaking raw materials using substitutes such as reed pulp, bamboo pulp, and bagasse pulp is also increasing in paper mills. In cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, and Fushun, many timber-using units have begun to pay attention to the recycling of packaging materials and the recycling of old pit props, and are reusing them after processing. These methods are all effective. However, this does not mean that all timber-using units attach importance to saving timber. Some timber-using units believe that if there is no timber, they can go up the mountains to cut it or ask for it from higher authorities. Therefore, phenomena such as using large materials for small purposes, using long materials for short purposes, and using good materials for poor purposes still exist. Some timber-using units only consider the convenience of their own units, and phenomena such as cutting wide and using narrow, requisitioning more than needed, and stockpiling without using still exist. Some timber-using units do not pay attention to recycling what should be recycled, do not utilize substitutes that should be utilized, and do not value the promotion of advanced experiences that can be promoted. For example, the amount of pit props used per ton of coal in the coal mining industry is increasing year by year, and some coal mines do not pay enough attention to the recycling of pit props. Some units of the Ministry of Railways have many old sleepers that can still be used after being recycled, but they sell them to workers at low prices to be used as firewood. A large amount of packaging materials can be used after being slightly repaired after recycling, but this work is still unregulated in many areas. Some units emphasize the special needs of their departments and set the specifications for timber too high, such as not using side cuts, not using tops, not using materials with slight bends, and not using materials with knots. As a result, the utilization rate of timber for vehicle manufacturing only accounts for 30% of logs, and the utilization rate of timber for furniture only accounts for 40% of logs. When selecting timber, some units only follow their own unit's usage habits or mechanically apply foreign standards, only wanting a certain type or a few types of trees, otherwise they refuse to use them. The above phenomena must be quickly and resolutely corrected.

    It should also be pointed out that some forest harvesting departments, due to poor management and a lack of the spirit of cherishing state property, still seriously discard timber on logging sites and along logging roads. In some log yards, due to poor storage, the situation of timber rotting, degrading, and deteriorating is also very serious.

    In addition, brick kilns, ceramic kilns, and iron factories using indigenous methods of iron smelting mostly still use wood as fuel. We hope that these units will promote the burning of coal as much as possible to save timber.

    Currently, all timber-using units are compiling and verifying next year's timber plans. In order to utilize our country's timber resources more economically and effectively, we should carefully study in which areas we can use less or no timber, which areas can find substitutes, and which areas can recycle and reuse waste timber. After careful calculation, we should then make specific plans. The shortage of timber will be a long-term problem for us, and ignoring this problem is not allowed. Therefore, strictly conserving timber is a regular and important task for all timber-using units.

    严格节约木材
    从今年第二季度开始，木材生产和供应之间的矛盾越来越突出。先是供不应求，后来严重脱销。这中间最感缺乏的是铺设铁路用的枕木、采煤用的坑木、架设电报电话网用的电柱等特殊用材。其
  他如造纸、造船、造车、建筑房屋以及制造农具、家具等用材，也都同样远远赶不上需要。很显然，这一问题如不适当解决，不仅关系到我们国家建设事业的发展，也将影响到人民日常需要的满足。
    解决这个问题的办法，通常有两种。一种是加速森林采伐工业的进度，提高木材产量。另一种是按照节约原则厉行节约，尽可能地减少木材的消耗。
    根据我国森林资源来看，只靠前一种办法是不行的。我国森林资源不足，是人所共知的。据初步调查，除康、藏等西南边远地区以外，森林的总蓄积量约有五十亿立方公尺，只等于苏联森林总蓄积量的十分之一。随着国家建设事业的发展，对木材的需要是越来越多的。如果把1950年的木材产量作为100，早在1954年就已达到了439.8。今年木材产量已达到1957年的国家计划产量水平，却仍不够用。第二个五年计划工业建设将进一步增长，对木材需要自然也会随着增加。由于我国森林资源的不足，我们不可能漫无限制地每年采伐过多的木材，而只能合理地提高一定的采伐量。另一方面，我们的木材利用率是很低的。由于我们国家林产化学工业不发达，加上用材单位在制材中存在很多问题没有解决，使大量的树木枝丫、树皮、梢头，边材、木屑、刨花不能充分利用。按森林工业部的计算，目前森林资源只能利用到27％。原木利用平均也只有50％（各先进国家都已利用到80％—90％以上），就是说用了一半丢了一半。有些用材单位的原木甚至只能利用到20％—30％，也就是说用了一小半，丢了一大半。
    从上述这一基本情况看来，适当地加速森林采伐工业的发展，以提高木材产量，是必要的。但是，如果我们单纯依靠增加木材产量来解决木材的困难，就会造成森林资源日益枯竭的恶果。从长远设想，解决木材问题最根本的办法，是大力开展造林事业。但林木的成长不是三年五年的事。即使最普通的杨木也需要二十年以上才能用，比较贵重的林木要四五十年甚至百年左右才能成材。因此，解决当前木材不足的困难，关键在于所有用材单位严格地按照节约原则，大力推广节约木材的先进经验，充分利用代用品，尽量地减少木材的消耗。
    不少用材单位，对节约木材也曾给了一定程度的重视。如火柴工厂削短了火柴杆的长度，只是这一项每年就能节约两万多立方公尺木材。工程建筑单位正在广泛采用水泥地板，大力推广利用竹子代替木材搭脚手架的经验。造纸工厂采用苇浆、竹浆、甘蔗渣浆等代用品作造纸原料的比重也在增加。在北京、上海、沈阳、抚顺等城市，很多用材单位都已开始注意到包装用材回收、旧坑木回收，并在加工后重新利用，这些办法都很起作用。然而，这并不等于说，所有用材单位对节约木材都是重视的。有些用材单位，认为没有木材可以上山砍，也可以向上级伸手要，因此大材小用、长材短用、优材劣用等现象依然存在。也有些用材单位只图本单位使用方便，宽打窄用、少用多领、备而不用等现象依然存在。也有些用材单位，应该回收的不注意回收，应该利用代用品的不加利用，能推广的先进经验不重视推广。例如采煤工业每吨煤的坑木用量逐年增加，有些煤矿很不重视坑木回收工作。铁道部有些单位有很多旧枕木回收后仍可利用，但他们都低价卖给职工作柴烧了。大量的包装用材，回收后只要稍加修理就可利用，但这一工作在不少地区仍是自流的。有些单位，强调本部门的特殊需要，把用材规格提的过高，如边材不用，梢头不用，有一点弯曲不用，有结疤也不用，结果车辆制造用材的利用率只占原木的30％，家具用材的利用率只占原木的40％。有些单位选用木材的时候，只按照本单位使用习惯，或者机械套用国外标准，只要某一种或少数几种树种，否则他们就拒绝使用。上述现象都必须迅速地坚决地纠正。
    还应该指出，有些森林采伐部门由于管理不善，缺乏爱护国家财产的精神，在采伐迹地上，在集材道上，也还严重地发生丢弃木材的现象。有些贮木场由于保管不善，木材腐朽、降等变质的情形也非常严重。
    此外，砖瓦窑、陶瓷窑，以及土法炼铁的铁工厂，大部分都还在使用木材作燃料。我们希望这些单位尽可能地推广烧煤，把木材节约下来。
    目前各用材单位都在编制和核订明年用材计划。为了更经济更有效地利用我国的木材资源，应该慎重地研究在哪些方面可以少用或者不用木材，有哪些可以找到代用品，有哪些是可以回收重新利用的废木，经过仔细的核算，然后再具体地作出计划。木材不足将是我们长期存在的问题，忽视这一问题是不允许的。因此，严格节约木材，是所有用材单位一项经常的重要的工作。
