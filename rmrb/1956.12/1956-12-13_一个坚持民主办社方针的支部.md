    A Branch That Adheres to the Democratic Management of the Cooperative
    Zhang Hua
    Wangjiagou is a mountain village in Jianping County, Hebei Province. Originally, there was little watered land and low yields, and the lives of the peasants were still very poor after the land reform. After the realization of agricultural cooperation this spring, several small reservoirs in the mountain gully were built, animal-powered waterwheels were installed, and many measures were taken to increase production. Although this year's wind and rain disasters were severe, the harvest still increased by 30% compared with bumper years. According to the cooperative's annual distribution settlement, 93% of the cooperative's 130-odd households have increased their income compared with last year. The income of ninety-five households has increased by more than a quarter compared with last year. The grain and money distributed to the five "Five Guarantees" households were also more than last year.
    The main reason why the Wangjiagou Agricultural Cooperative can be run so well is that the Wangjiagou Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party is good at following the mass line and leading the agricultural cooperative to adhere to the policy of democratic management.
    Handling Affairs According to the Thoughts of the Members
    To fathom the thoughts of the members from their various opinions and handle affairs according to their thoughts is the leadership method that the Wangjiagou Branch has always adhered to. In the early days of the cooperative's establishment, some new members were worried about whether the cooperative's cadres could manage the assets of these 100-odd households well. Some old middle-peasant members wanted to know whether the cooperative could actually increase their income. Various opinions and arguments from various members were reflected in the branch committee. The branch committee conducted repeated investigations and studies and realized that all members, regardless of their type, wanted to understand the "bottom line" of the cooperative. Therefore, the party branch helped the cooperative management committee formulate a four-year development plan for the cooperative, as well as annual production increase projects and income growth targets. The members estimated their income based on the cooperative's overall plan and felt reassured, and their production enthusiasm was very high. More than 95% of the male labor force and more than 40% of the female labor force actively attended work, and production efficiency also improved compared with the past. This year, when the peaches and apricots were about to ripen, many members were concerned about the fruit trees on the land that had been put into the cooperative. The male members were worried that the fruits would be picked and eaten casually by everyone, reducing their income; the women were afraid that it would be inconvenient for the children to eat the fruits. The party branch learned of these demands and immediately solicited opinions from the members separately. Finally, it was decided to estimate the value of this season's fruit income and lease it to the original owners, who would be responsible for guarding, picking, and selling the fruit. In this way, losses were avoided, and the members' demands for eating fruit were also met.
    Each production team of the Wangjiagou Agricultural Cooperative has a party group, and the party members talk to the members at any time and place. The groups conduct regular studies and report to the branch. Based on the reflections of the groups, the party branch studies the demands of the members every half month and proposes measures according to the opinions of the majority of the members, discusses them with the members, and decides on the method. The party branch often educates the party members to handle affairs according to the demands of the masses. Anyone who does not do so will be given appropriate criticism or even punishment. Party member Feng Ruwen, who served as the deputy head of the cooperative's agricultural section, could not humbly listen to the opinions of the masses. The branch repeatedly taught him without success, so it suggested that the cooperative replace him.
    Patiently Educating the Members
    Before deciding on each specific matter, the Wangjiagou Branch of the Chinese Communist Party used methods such as calculating accounts and making comparisons to persuade the members whose thinking was not clear. After the wheat harvest this year, corn needed topdressing. Based on the conditions for increasing production, such as turning dry land into paddy fields and appropriate dense planting, most members proposed the opinion of applying chemical fertilizer. The branch agreed with this opinion, but a few members disagreed because they were afraid of increasing expenses and reducing summer dividends. The branch patiently educated them, explaining with past examples of increased production in the village that one yuan and six jiao of fertilizer per mu could increase grain production by 60 jin. After calculating the accounts, the thinking of a few members was straightened out. All 300 mu of corn in the cooperative were topdressed. Although they suffered severe wind disasters, each mu still yielded 70 jin more than last year.
    Encouraging People to Offer Opinions
    After its establishment, the Wangjiagou Agricultural Cooperative established a complete set of democratic systems. Members' congresses are held regularly to discuss and decide on major issues within the cooperative; the cooperative's accounts are also published to the members in a timely manner. The Wangjiagou Branch believed that it was not enough to do only this, and also wanted to encourage members to offer opinions in various ways. In early November, when the cooperative affairs committee was arranging agricultural work, it saw that the weather was not too cold and decided to let the turnips grow for a few more days to increase the harvest. However, an experienced old member made a suggestion to the cooperative, requesting that they be harvested in early November to prevent frost damage. The cooperative adopted his opinion and broadcast his suggestion to all members, praising his concern for the collective interest.
    Whenever members made achievements in their work in the cooperative or made progress, the branch would commend them in various forms. After members Feng Ruying, Feng Zhixiang, and others were injured at work, they still went to the production team to do the light work they could do. The cooperative immediately broadcast their deeds to the entire cooperative. The old middle-peasant member Feng Qingsheng originally had concerns when handing over his base investment, but later the cooperative cadres helped him straighten out his thinking. He actively handed over his base investment, and the cooperative also commended him. In this way, a general atmosphere of striving for progress gradually formed in the entire cooperative. From spring plowing to autumn harvest, various advanced individuals emerging in the entire cooperative reached one-third of the total number of members. The cooperative's rewards for members are diverse. In addition to commendation and encouragement through the radio station, blackboard bulletin, and meetings, there are also material rewards. In the first half of this year alone, the cooperative purchased seventeen yuan worth of towels, soap, straw hats, etc., and awarded them to thirty-five model members.
    Listening to Opposing Opinions
    The Wangjiagou Branch of the Chinese Communist Party often talks to people with grievances and listens to their opinions. In the first half of this year, member Feng Xiaofu was not active in labor, and also spoke strange words, often contradicting the cooperative cadres. The branch secretary and the director of the cooperative did not discriminate against him. They talked to him, patiently soliciting his opinions on the leadership of the cooperative. Feng Xiaofu said that the cooperative should not have treated him as a backward member during the rectification of the cooperative, and should not have called him to meetings with landlords and rich peasants. The branch studied Feng Xiaofu's opinion and helped the cooperative cadres overcome the shortcomings of discriminating against backward members. In the early days of the cooperative's establishment, some wealthy members were not active in investing in the cooperative. The branch helped the cooperative cadres convene these people for discussions, solicited opinions, and reasonably handled the issue of mutual benefit between the cooperative and the members in the investment base investment. These people invested their farm tools, pack frames, and ropes in the cooperative. In this way, the average investment of all members in the cooperative increased to more than 30 yuan per person, reducing the cooperative's expenses for purchasing farm tools.
    Implementing Collective Leadership
    The working method of the Wangjiagou Branch of the Chinese Communist Party in following the mass line is based on the party's collective leadership. The branch committee has a sound party committee system. Five members are assigned to five production teams to guide and assist the party groups in the production teams to contact and educate the members, and implement the party's resolutions. Problems reflected by the party members are brought to the branch committee for discussion and decision. Recently, some members reflected that: it is best to have a controlled number of vegetable plots since each person is left with one point of land and members with large families cannot finish planting. Branch committee member and cooperative director Feng Chanwen reflected this opinion to the branch secretary and requested the branch to hold a meeting to discuss it. The branch secretary notified each branch committee member of this opinion, asking them to prepare their opinions before the meeting. Based on the demands of the members, the branch committee members quickly made suggestions at the meeting to revise the regulations on private plots and handed them over to the cooperative's cadres and members for discussion and decision.
    Differences of opinion in the branch committee are unavoidable. The principle of the Wangjiagou Branch in unifying these opinions is to see whose opinion is conducive to increasing production and increasing income. In the spring, the branch committee discussed water conservancy construction based on the opinions of the members, and some branch committee members raised negative opinions. Later, after calculating expenses, calculating income increases, calculating labor, and calculating financial resources, the understanding was unified, the water conservancy was built, and 28,000 jin of grain were increased that year.

    一个坚持民主办社方针的支部
    张华
    王家沟是河北省建屏县的一个山庄。这里原来水地少、产量低，土地改革以后农民的生活还很穷苦。今年春天实现农业合作化以后，山沟里的几座小型水库修成了，装了畜力水车，采取了许多增产措施，今年风雨灾害虽然严重，收成还比丰收年头增加了三成。根据社里的全年分配决算，全社一百三十来户社员当中，93％的社员都比去年增加了收入。有九十五户社员的收入比去年增加四分之一以上。五家“五保”户分得的粮款也比去年多。
    王家沟农业社能够办得这样好，主要原因是中共王家沟村支部善于走群众路线，领导农业社坚持了民主办社的方针。
    按着社员的心思办事
    从社员的各种意见里揣摸社员的心思，按照社员的心思办事，这是王家沟支部一贯坚持的领导方法。建社初期，一些新社员担心合作社干部能不能把这一百多户的家当管好。有些老中农社员，更想知道合作社究竟能不能使他们增加收入。各种社员的各样说法和论调反映到支部委员会。支部委员会进行了反复的调查研究，知道无论那类社员，都是想了解合作社的“底”。于是党支部便帮助社管理委员会订出了合作社的四年发展规划和每年的增产建设项目及收入增长指标。社员们根据社里总的计划预计了自己的收入，觉得心里有底了，生产情绪很高。全社95％以上的男劳力，40％以上的女劳力积极出勤做工，生产效率也比过去提高了。今年桃子、杏子快成熟的时候，许多社员都关心着入社的土地上的果木。男社员担心果子被大家随便摘吃，减少收入；妇女们怕孩子们吃果子不方便。党支部了解到这些要求，立即分别征求社员意见，最后决定把这一季果木收入估产作价佃给原主，由社员负责看管摘卖。这样，就避免了损失，社员吃果子的要求也满足了。
    王家沟农业社每个生产队都有党的小组，党员们随时随地同社员谈心，小组定期研究并向支部汇报。党支部根据小组的反映，每半个月研究一次社员群众的要求，并按照多数社员的意见提出措施和社员商量，决定办法。党支部经常教育党员要按着群众的要求办事，谁不这样做就给以适当的批评甚至处分。党员封如文担任合作社农业副股长，不能虚心听取群众意见，支部屡教不改，就建议合作社撤换了他。
    耐心地教育社员
    中共王家沟支部在每件具体事情决定以前，都用算账、对比等方法，说服思想不通的社员。今年麦收后，玉米需要施追肥，多数社员根据旱地变水田、适当密植等增产条件，提出了追施化学肥料的意见。支部同意这个意见，但有少数社员却怕增加开支减少夏季分红而不同意追肥。支部向他们进行耐心的教育，以本村过去的增产事例，向他们说明，每亩地上一元六角钱的肥料，便能增产六十斤粮食。经过算账，少数社员的思想搞通了。全社三百亩玉米都上了追肥，虽然遭受严重风灾，每亩还比去年多收了七十斤粮食。
    鼓励提意见的人
    王家沟农业社建社后就建立了一套完整的民主制度。社员大会定期召开，讨论决定社内大事；社里的账目也及时向社员公布。王家沟支部认为只是这样做还是不够的，还想各种办法鼓励社员提意见。11月初，社务委员会在安排农活的时候，看到天气还不太冷，决定让蔓菁多长些日子，增加收成。但是一个有经验的老社员向社里提出了建议，要求在11月上旬刨收，预防霜冻损失。社里采纳了他的意见，并向全体社员广播了他的建议，表扬他对集体利益的关心。
    凡是社员在社里工作做出了成绩，有了进步，支部都通过各种形式加以表扬。社员封如英、封志祥等三人因工受伤以后，仍到生产队去做他们能做的轻活，社里立即把他们的事迹向全社广播。老中农社员封清生交底垫的时候原先有顾虑，后来社干部帮助他搞通了思想，他积极地交了底垫，合作社也表扬了他。这样，全社便逐渐形成了争进步的风气。从春耕到秋收，全社涌现的各种先进分子达到社员总数的三分之一。合作社对社员的奖励是多样的。除通过广播台、黑板报和在会议上表扬鼓励以外，还有物质奖励。只今年上半年，合作社就购买了十七元的毛巾、肥皂、草帽等，奖给三十五名模范社员。
    听取反对意见
    中共王家沟支部经常找有不满情绪的人谈话，并听取他们的意见。今年上半年，社员封小富劳动不积极，并且讲怪话，常常顶撞社干部。支部书记和社长并没有歧视他。他们找他谈话，耐心地征求他对合作社领导方面的意见。封小富说，合作社在整社的时候不该把他当成落后社员，不该叫他同地主、富农在一起开会。支部研究了封小富的意见，便帮助合作社干部克服了歧视落后社员的缺点。建社初期，有些富裕的社员不积极向社里投资，支部帮助社干部召集这些人座谈，征求意见，合理地处理了投资底垫当中社和社员互利的问题。这些人把农具、驮架、绳索都投到社里了。这样，便使全社社员的投资每人平均增到三十多元，减少了社里购置农具的费用。
    实行集体领导
    中共王家沟支部走群众路线的工作方法是以党的集体领导为基础的。支部委员会有健全的党委制。五个委员分到五个生产队，指导和协助生产队里的党小组联系和教育社员群众，执行党的决议。党员反映了问题就拿到支部委员会讨论决定。最近有些社员反映：每人留一分菜地，人口多的社员种不完，最好有一个控制数。支部委员、合作社主任封产文就把这个意见反映给支部书记，并要求支部开会讨论。支部书记把这个意见通知各支部委员，让他们在会前准备意见。支部委员们根据社员的要求在会上很快就做出了修改关于自留地的规定的建议，交给合作社的干部和社员讨论决定。
    支部委员会的意见分歧是不可避免的。王家沟支部统一这些意见的原则是看谁的意见有利于增加生产增加收入。春天支委会根据社员意见讨论修水利，有的支部委员提出否定意见。后来经过算开支、算增收、算劳力、算财力统一了认识，水利修成了，当年就增产了两万八千斤粮食。
