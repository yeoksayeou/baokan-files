Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, 9th December: Over a million citizens of Calcutta gathered at the city’s large parade ground and nearby streets and open spaces at 3 PM today to participate in a grand civic rally welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long. The rally was specially convened for the distinguished Chinese guests by Calcutta Mayor S.C. Ghosh.

　　Countless Indian and Chinese flags fluttered over this largest square in Calcutta. Everywhere the eye could see was densely packed with people.

　　Deafening cheers erupted from the crowd as the Chinese guests entered the square by car. Mayor Ghosh presented the guests with garlands inscribed with the words "Long Live Indo-China Friendship." The Chinese guests, accompanied by West Bengal Governor Naidu, Chief Minister Roy, and Mayor Ghosh, then ascended the high platform designed in the style of an ancient Indian chariot.

　　Premier Zhou spoke to the welcoming crowd. Roy read out the Bengali translation of Premier Zhou Enlai's speech.

　　During Premier Zhou Enlai's speech, the attendees repeatedly cheered loudly, and kites were used to send the flags of India and China into the air.

　　As the welcoming rally concluded, the band played the national anthems of India and China. At this moment, all the people who had been sitting cross-legged on the grass stood up.

　　Before the welcoming rally began, a group of young people sang poems written by the famous Indian poet Tagore, as well as a song entitled "Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai" (Indians and Chinese are brothers).

　　Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, 9th December: The Indo-China Friendship Association West Bengal branch held a reception on the afternoon of the 8th to warmly welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier He Long, and presented them with twenty-six volumes of works by the poet Tagore and other Bengali writers.

　　President of the Indo-China Friendship Association West Bengal branch and Speaker of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly, S.K. Mukherjee, said that Zhou Enlai is "a revolutionary leader of awakened China, a proponent of Asian-African solidarity, and an advocate of Panchsheel and world peace."

　　In his speech, Premier Zhou Enlai spoke of the important role played by the China-India Friendship Association and the India-China Friendship Association in uniting the millions of people of the two countries. He said that due to the aggression of colonialists against the people of Asia and Africa today, strengthening friendship and cooperation between the two countries "is not only beneficial to the people of our two countries, but also of extreme importance to the unity of Asian and African countries."

　　加尔各答百万市民集会欢迎周总理
　　印中友协西孟加拉邦分会招待中国朋友
    新华社加尔各答9日电　一百多万加尔各答市民今天下午三时聚集在这个印度最大城市的大操场和附近街道和空地上，参加欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理的盛大的市民欢迎大会。这个大会是加尔各答市长萨·钱·高士特别为中国贵宾召开的。
    在这个加尔各答最大的广场上，飘扬着无数面印度和中国的国旗，眼睛所能看到的地方都是密密层层的人。
    当中国客人们乘着汽车进入广场时，人群中发出了震耳欲聋的欢呼声。高士市长给客人们戴上了上面有“印中友谊万岁”字样的花环。接着，中国客人们在西孟加拉邦邦长奈都女士、首席部长罗伊和高士市长陪同下，登上了按照印度古代战车式样设计的高高的讲台。
    周总理在那里向欢迎的人讲了话。罗伊用孟加拉语宣读了周恩来总理的讲话的译文。
    在周恩来总理讲话的时候，参加欢迎会的人一再高声欢呼，并且用风筝把印中两国的国旗放送到空中。
    欢迎大会结束的时候，乐队奏了印中两国的国歌。这时候，一直盘膝坐在草地上的人们全都站起来。
    在欢迎会开始之前，一批青年合唱了印度名诗人泰戈尔所写的诗歌以及一首题为“印地秦尼巴依巴依”（印中人民是兄弟）的歌。
    据新华社加尔各答9日电　印中友好协会西孟加拉邦分会8日下午举行招待会热烈欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理，并且把诗人泰戈尔和其他孟加拉文作家的著作共二十六卷赠送给他们。
    印中友好协会西孟加拉邦分会主席、西孟加拉邦立法会议议长沙·库·慕克吉说，周恩来是“觉醒了的中国的革命领袖，亚非团结的提倡者以及潘查希拉和世界和平的拥护者”。
    周恩来总理在他的讲话中谈到中印友好协会和印中友好协会在团结两国千千万万的人民方面所起的重要作用。他说，由于今天殖民主义者对亚非人民的侵略，加强两国之间的友谊和合作“不仅对我们两国人民有益，而且对亚非国家的团结也有极重要的意义”。
    据新华社加尔各答9日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和随行人员8日傍晚在政府大厦观看了泰戈尔创作的三幕舞剧“昌达利卡”。
    晚餐以后，周总理等一行人又观看了印度各地民间舞蹈表演。
    早些时候，中国总理曾经乘汽车到加尔各答市内各地游览观光。
