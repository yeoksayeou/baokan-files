　　Large Number of Steam Boilers Shipped to Karamay
    More than thirty steam boilers have been successively transported to the Karamay oil region. Some of these boilers were manufactured in Romania, and some were manufactured in our own country. After the nine boilers still en route arrive, they will basically meet the winter insulation needs of drilling, trial mining, and machine repair departments in the Karamay oil region. This is the second batch of boilers shipped to the oil region. Photo by Gao Rui (New China News Agency draft)

　　大批蒸气锅炉运到克拉玛依
    克拉玛依油区，已经陆续运到了三十多台蒸气锅炉。这些锅炉有的是罗马尼亚制造的，有的是我国自己制造的。目前尚在途中的九台锅炉运到后，就基本上可以满足克拉玛依油区钻井、试采、机修等部门的冬季保温需要。这是运往油区的第二批锅炉。　高　锐摄（新华社稿）
