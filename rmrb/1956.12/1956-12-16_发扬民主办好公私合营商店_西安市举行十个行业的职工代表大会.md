Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 13th: Xi'an recently held employee representative assemblies for joint state-private stores in ten industries, including joint state-private department stores, watch and optical shops, and shoe and hat stores. This is the first time that employee representative assemblies have been held in these industries since the establishment of joint state-private ownership.

The representative assemblies promoted democracy. The representatives raised more than 140 suggestions concerning business management, leadership style, and trade union work. Based on these suggestions, the Municipal Department Store Company has decided to gradually establish democratic management committees in various joint state-private enterprises, so that employees can better manage the enterprises together with the store managers in the future. It has also decided to absorb the opinions of employees to inspect and improve the current business management system within the enterprises. Regarding the bloated administrative structure in some enterprises, adjustments will be made to transfer excessive personnel to strengthen the work of the sales departments. Excessive, cumbersome, and unreasonable reports and procedures will also be gradually simplified. The relevant departments are also studying the opinions raised by the assembly on employee learning, living, and welfare, and are preparing to gradually resolve them.

Since the beginning of this year, when the shops in these ten industries became joint state-private enterprises, employees have made achievements in assisting with inventory checks and asset verification, launching socialist labor competitions, uniting private personnel, and transforming enterprises. However, most stores have not established some democratic management systems in a timely manner, and some state representatives have not paid enough attention to the opinions and requirements of employees, which has prevented many employees from fully utilizing their enthusiasm for improving business management. Before the convening of this assembly, these ten industries had universally held general employee meetings in stores to widely collect employee opinions. In addition to sending special personnel to directly solicit employee opinions in various stores, the trade union system also set up special suggestion boxes in many stores to absorb more opinions in preparation for the successful convening of this assembly.

    发扬民主办好公私合营商店
    西安市举行十个行业的职工代表大会
    新华社西安13日电　西安市最近举行公私合营百货、钟表眼镜、鞋帽等十个行业公私合营商店职工代表大会。这些行业公私合营以来，这是第一次举行职工代表大会。
    这次代表大会发扬了民主，代表们在会上共提出有关经营管理、企业领导作风、工会工作等意见一百四十多件。根据这些意见，市百货公司已经决定在各公私合营企业中逐步建立民主管理委员会，使职工今后能够更好地和商店经理一道管好企业；对目前企业内的经营管理制度，也决定吸收职工的意见，加以检查和改进；关于某些行政机构人员臃肿的情况，将加以调整，把过多的人员抽出加强门市部的工作；对过多过繁不合理的报表、手续也将逐步简化。大会对职工学习、生活福利等方面提出的意见，有关部门也正在研究，准备逐步加以解决。
    这十个行业的商店自从今年年初公私合营以来，职工在协助清产核资、开展社会主义劳动竞赛、团结私方人员和改造企业等方面，都做出了成绩。但是，大部分商店都没有及时地建立一些民主管理制度，有的公股代表对职工的意见和要求注意不够，使许多职工对改进企业经营管理的积极性不能很好地发挥。在这次大会召开以前，这十个行业曾经普遍举行了商店全体职工大会，广泛地收集职工意见。工会系统除了派出专人深入各商店直接征求职工意见以外，还在许多商店设有专门的意见箱，吸收更多的意见，为开好这次大会作准备。
