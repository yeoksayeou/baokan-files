　　Such a "Civilized Structure"
    On November 27th, British Acting Prime Minister Butler, speaking to American reporters, said: "We hope to cooperate with the United Nations, but their position must also change." He demanded that the United Nations and Britain and France "reach a consensus." He said: "If anyone thinks that British troops will all withdraw after today, they are mistaken."
    On the same day, the Conservative newspaper "Daily Express" echoed, shouting "Let us now withdraw from the United Nations." This newspaper attacked the United Nations for "stubbornly opposing civilized, democratic countries in the Middle East issue, and siding with autocratic, backward countries," even saying that the United Nations is a "deceitful institution... It destroys the structure of civilization, comforts evildoers, and pursues immoral goals with feigned piety."
    What a "civilized, democratic" country! This country signed the United Nations Charter, and when it wanted to use the United Nations to "pursue immoral goals," its representatives spoke many words of feigned piety on the UN podium, such as "maintaining peace" and "defending freedom"... However, its actions were openly armed aggression against Egypt, destroying peace in the Middle East, slaughtering women and children, and bombing churches and hospitals. When more than seventy countries in the United Nations almost unanimously demanded the implementation of the United Nations Charter, opposed the aggression of Britain and France, and demanded that the invaders withdraw from Egypt, this country openly displayed a rogue's ability, cursing the United Nations, and even shamelessly demanded that the United Nations be "consistent" with it, that is, demanding that all countries participating in the United Nations help it kill and set fires and occupy Egyptian territory.
    The British Conservative government's set of skills is like a shameless hooligan criminal who, in court, not only does not plead guilty but demands that the court commit evil with it. The so-called "civilized structure" of Britain turns out to be like this!

### 如此“文明的结构”

　　如此“文明的结构”
    11月27日，英国代理首相巴特勒向美国记者发表谈话说：“我们希望同联合国合作，但是它们的立场也必须要有所改变。”他要求联合国和英法“取得一致”。他说：“如果有任何人认为今天以后英国军队就会全部撤退，那他就错了。”
    同一天，保守党报纸“每日快报”更配合着叫喊“让我们现在退出联合国组织”。这家报纸攻击联合国在中东问题上“顽固地反对文明的、民主的国家，偏袒专制的、落后的国家”，甚至说联合国是“骗人的机构。……它破坏文明的结构，安慰作恶者并且用假装虔诚的话语来追求不道德的目的。”
    好一个“文明的、民主的”国家！这个国家是在联合国宪章上签了字的，当它要利用联合国来“追求不道德的目的”的时候，它的代表不知在联合国讲坛上说过多少假装虔诚的话语，什么“维护和平”、“保卫自由”……。然而它的行动却是公然武装侵略埃及，破坏中东的和平，屠杀妇女和儿童，轰炸教堂和医院。当联合国的七十多个国家几乎全体一致地要求实现联合国宪章，反对英法的侵略，要求侵略者撤出埃及的时候，这个国家就公然耍出一副无赖的本领，破口谩骂联合国，甚至无耻到要求联合国和它“一致”，也就是要求一切参加联合国的国家帮着它去杀人放火，霸占埃及的领土。
    英国保守党政府的这套本领，如同丧尽廉耻的流氓罪犯，在法庭上不但不认罪，反而要求法庭同它一道作恶。英国所谓“文明的结构”，原来是这么一回事！
