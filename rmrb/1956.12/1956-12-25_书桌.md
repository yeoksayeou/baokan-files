    Desk
    Xu Kailui
    Has anyone, after traveling thousands of miles, exhausted and weary, on the verge of collapse, suddenly found a warm place to stay in the almost hopeless twilight? Has anyone, after a long illness, with doctors shaking their heads, when the hope of life was about to bid you a miserable farewell, suddenly obtained a miraculous remedy, and then recovered miraculously?

    My desk, my poor yet fortunate steed, it has experienced the same fate as the night traveler and the long-suffering patient.

    My desk is wearing new clothes: crimson paint, and a bright glass plate on the tabletop; the copper drawer handles also gleam. Whenever I approach it, use it, I can't help but stroke it, and at the same time, I want to tell it something. "Thank you, dear old friend!" I really want to pour out my heart to it. But it always remains silent, like a loyal steed, although it doesn't speak, it's more reliable than someone who does, more capable of bearing weight, and more capable of encouraging me to walk towards the road to victory.

    So I lie on it, and at the intersection of pen and paper, my thoughts and feelings run wild. In this unrestrained journey, when I occasionally pause, when my eyes meet the desk, I feel like a team has arrived at a mobilization station.

    I hear it shouting in silence, constantly telling me its own story in silence:

    My desk was left to me by my grandfather. It is old and dilapidated. When I was young, I was used to seeing my grandfather working beside it. My grandfather was a careful and melancholic man, he always wrote and gasped at the same time; stacks of rough yellow manuscripts were filled with his tiny calligraphy, each small character symbolizing the carving away of every hour of his life. The years had made him old, withered, and gaunt.

    After my grandfather died, my father took his place. But the desk was even older, it became strange and garrulous, like a talkative old man. Every night, when my father sat beside it, it would always make various noises incessantly: gurgle – gurgle – ? –

      "Is it telling the story of my grandfather? Saying that my father is even worse than my grandfather?" I lay in bed, watching my father constantly copying in the dim light, and I realized that my father was even weaker, even more inhuman.

    When my father passed this desk on to me, I was still a young and strong man. I sat at this desk earlier than my grandfather and father, and this desk sang the same song for me: for the sake of life, I write and copy, and I can't stop for a moment.

    The desk became more and more dilapidated, the vermilion paint peeled off, the base was crumbling, and every time I approached it, it would constantly shake its head and sigh at me. Obviously, this poor steed had shouldered so much hardship and sorrow for three generations of our family, and on this long journey, it was about to close its tired eyes and bid me farewell.

      "Go, along with my pen, along with my paper!" I urged the death of my desk, like cursing the annihilation of an enemy. Because isn't it this desk that has devoured a large amount of years from three generations of our family? Its existence is my death.

    But just seven years ago, on that summer morning, just as I was preparing an axe to chop this old desk into firewood, suddenly a bugle call from the horizon entered my eardrums, like a lost night traveler finding the light, a dying long-term patient obtaining a good prescription, and thus the fate of my desk turned around.

    From that day on, I began to repair the desk. Life cheered me up, I love the new days, so I also love the desk. A carpenter repaired it for me, and a painter sprayed it for me. It was decorated to be solid and beautiful, and it no longer shook its head, wagged its tail, or sighed. When I put new books on it, I seemed to hear it shout to me in silence: "Charge yourself up too!" When I put pen and paper on it, I also heard it encouraging me: Give me courage, and tell me not to stop.

    Therefore, I gallop.

    Seven years have passed, and the desk has helped me and conveyed a lot of strength to me. Recently, I asked the original carpenter and painter to give it a thorough renovation again, on the eve of their departure to the Northwest to participate in collective construction. I said that I would use this desk for the rest of my life, not only because of thrift; more importantly, it is because its fate once had a turning point, and I cherish this turning point.

    Because of this turning point, it gained life, and I also gained life!

    书桌
    徐开垒
    有谁千里跋涉，人困马倦，行将恹恹一息的时候，忽然在近乎绝望的暮色中，找到过温暖的夜宿？有谁在久病不起，群医摇首，生的希望就要向你作惨然的告别时，忽然得到了良药一方，遂就霍然而愈？
    我的书桌呵，我这可怜而又幸福的坐骑，它恰经历了夜行人和久病者同样的命运。
    我的书桌穿上了新装：朱红的油漆，桌面上还安着明亮的玻璃板；紫铜制成的抽屉把柄，也闪闪发光。每当我接近它、使用它的时候，我总是禁不住用手去抚摸它，同时又想对它有所诉述。“感谢你啊，亲爱的老友！”我真欲向它一吐衷情了。而它总是沉默着，像一头忠实的坐骑，虽然不说话，但比会说话的更可靠，更能负重，更能鼓舞我走到胜利的道路上去。
    于是我在它的上面伏着，在笔和纸的交界线上，我的思想感情奔放着。在这一奔放的路程中，当我偶一停留，当我的眼光接触到书桌的时候，我就好像一支队伍到达了一个鼓动站。
    我听见它在沉默中叫喊，在沉默中向我不断地讲它自己的故事：
    我的书桌是我爷爷留下来的。它是古老而又破旧。当我幼小的时候，我就看惯我爷爷坐在它的旁边工作了。我爷爷是一个细心忧郁的人，他总是一边写，一边喘气；一叠叠粗糙的黄抄本，写满了他的蝇头小楷，每一个细小的字，都象征了他生命中的每一个时辰的雕落。年光把他晒得衰老又干瘪了。
    我爷爷死去后，我的父亲代替了他的位置。可是书桌更老了，它变得古怪而噜苏，一如一个多嘴的老人。每当夜深，我父亲坐在它的旁边，它总是不息地响着各种声音：咕噜——咕噜——?——
      “它是在讲述着我祖父的故事么？说我父亲比我祖父更不如了。”我睡在床上，看着父亲在昏黄的灯光下不断抄写，我发觉我父亲更其衰弱，更其无复人形了。
    当我父亲把这张书桌传给我的时候，我还是一个年轻而健壮的人。我比我爷爷和父亲更早坐上这张书桌，这张书桌替我唱着同样的歌：为了生活，我写呀抄呀的，一刻也不得停留。
    书桌越发衰颓了，朱漆剥落，座基倾废，每当我靠近它去，它就向我不断地摇头叹气。显然，这头可怜的坐骑，它肩负了我们祖孙三代多少的艰苦和忧愁呵，在千里迢迢的旅程中，它就要闭上它劳累的双眼，向我诀别了。
      “你去吧，和着我的笔，和着我的纸！”我催促着我的书桌的灭亡，像诅咒一个仇人的消灭。因为不正是这张书桌，它吞食去我们祖孙三代大量的岁月吗？它的存在，就是我的死亡。
    可是就在七年前的那个夏天的早晨里，正当我准备着斧子把这张破旧的书桌砍作柴薪时，忽然天边一声号角吹入我的耳鼓，犹如迷途的夜行者找到了灯光，垂死的久病人获得了良方，遂使我的书桌的命运转变了。
    从那天起，我开始把书桌整修。生活使我振作，我爱新的日子，因此也爱书桌。木工为我把它修理，漆工为我把它喷刷。它被打扮得坚实又美观，它再也不摇头摆尾唉声叹气。当我把新的书放在它的上面，我好像在沉默中听见它喊我：“把你自己也充实起来吧！”当我把笔和纸放在它的上面，我也听见它在鼓动着我：给我勇气，叫我不要停留。
    因此，我驰骋。
    七年过去，书桌帮助我，输送过我不少力量。新近我又请原来的木工和漆工来替它作了一次彻底的装修，在他们远赴西北参加集体建设事业的前夕。我说我要应用这张书桌，终我的一生，这不仅是因为节约；更主要的则是由于它的命运曾经有过一个转折，而我恰恰珍爱这个转折。
    因为这个转折，它得到了生命，我也得到了生命啊！
