	"Trench Foot"
	Qin Mu

	In medicine, there is a disease called "trench foot." This is a severe form of frostbite, and those who suffer from it often have to have both frostbitten feet completely amputated.

	We know that freezing can be fatal. The pathological changes caused by freezing are generally divided into three degrees. The first degree is that the frozen area turns red, gradually turning bluish-purple, and sensation is lost. The second degree is inflammation, blisters, and ulcers. The third degree is tissue necrosis, which leaves no choice but to amputate. "Trench foot" refers to the condition where soldiers squat in frozen trenches for too long, and the frostbite progresses from the first and second degrees to the third degree, resulting in them becoming first-class disabled persons without even fighting. During the First World War, a large number of soldiers had their feet amputated due to this disease. Therefore, the term "trench foot" began to appear in medical dictionaries and became a general term for this type of frostbitten foot disease.

	Soldiers can become disabled due to this "trench foot" disease, and it is especially easy for imperialists to develop this disease.

	The Chinese people are familiar with the saying "Japan's muddy feet." The connotation of the words "muddy feet" is very similar to that of "trench foot," meaning stepping down one step at a time, and finally being unable to pull out. The Japanese imperialists contracted this "trench foot" disease on the Chinese battlefield, just like Nazi Germany contracted this disease on the Stalingrad battlefield.

	Individuals and countries that contract this disease are like this: on the surface, the condition does not seem to be serious all at once, but it is constantly increasing. When the seriousness is discovered, both feet can only be sawed off, and the sufferer has to become a first-class disabled person.

	The armies of British and French imperialism are refusing to leave the northern end of the Suez Canal zone in Egypt, a situation which suggests that the feet of these two countries are gradually turning into "trench foot."

	The course of history is completely contrary to what the imperialists expected. When Eden signed the document of aggression against Egypt with a beaming face and a smug expression, he expected to occupy all of Egypt in a few days, but the facts proved that the imperialist army could not completely capture Port Said in a week. The British and French general staffs expected that the Arab countries would not act in unison, but as soon as the flames of war ignited, the imperialists' oil pipelines in the Near East were cut off one after another, and the Arab countries showed unprecedented unity of action. The imperialists initially thought that the support of the people of the world was just empty talk, but in the end, the Soviet Union's serious warning and the angry voices of the people of the world finally forced the invaders to issue a ceasefire order. Which of these things is consistent with what Eden, Mollet, and others expected?

	Now, Britain and France are in a great panic, and shipping in the Suez Canal has been interrupted. Ships are reverting to the old ways of the mid-nineteenth century, rounding the Cape of Good Hope. Britain and France are in a great oil panic. Britain's oil reserves are not enough for two months, and France's oil reserves are not enough for three months. The number of cars on the suburban avenues of British cities has been greatly reduced. France has begun to implement a plan to stop selling gasoline for two days a week. Western Europeans can no longer buy gasoline from the Near East at seven pounds per ton. They have to buy gasoline from the dollar zone at twenty-one pounds per ton. Oil merchants in Texas, USA, are beaming. Moreover, with the lack of oil and the difficulties of shipping, all the problems have flown to the heads of the invaders. Production is shrinking, prices are soaring, and strategic materials such as lead, tin, rubber, and wool have all fallen to "dangerous points." One week of arson cost Britain 100 million pounds in military spending. The reduction in oil production in the Middle East and the loss of freight is 13 million pounds per month, plus the increase in freight for imported materials, the losses caused by the reduction in production... all have not yet been calculated. As a result, Britain's gold and dollar reserves are declining rapidly, again approaching the "danger point." As a result, Eden, who was arrogant and self-satisfied a month ago, "fell" ill.

	When the flames of war started, British domestic opinion said that this was a gambler "betting on a treasure." Yes, just like putting a silver coin into a "slot machine," causing many things to jump out, but what jumps out are not silver coins, but many "panics."

	One week of vigorous arson has exhausted the country to this point. The decline of imperialism is beyond dispute. Now, the invaders have finally been forced to announce their withdrawal from Egypt. Although their spokesmen still want to defend it in vain, this after all shows the complete bankruptcy of the policy of aggression. Because, even if the Suez Canal is cleared immediately, navigation will have to wait for nearly half a year, but what if they refuse to leave? Navigation will be even more distant. What cannot be obtained on the battlefield cannot be obtained at the conference table. What cannot be obtained on the battlefield or at the conference table, how can it be obtained by playing rogue tricks? If the British and French aggressors insist on refusing to withdraw, their "trench foot" will eventually ulcerate. At that time, two more good men in the imperialist group will have to saw off their feet after their predecessors. Look, look, history will eventually prove all this. The doctors who saw off the feet are not limited to the Egyptian people.

### “战壕足”

    “战壕足”
    秦牧
    在医学上，有一种病的名称叫做“战壕足”。这是一种严重的冻伤病，害这种病的人往往要把两只冻伤的脚完全切掉。
    我们知道寒冻可以使人致命。因寒冻而生的病变一般分成三度，第一度是受冻地方发红、渐渐变成青紫色，感觉消失。第二度是发炎、生水泡、溃疡。第三度是组织坏死，只好切掉。所谓“战壕足”，就是士兵在寒冻的战壕中蹲立得太久，冻伤由一度二度进至三度，结果不用打仗，也会变成一等残废。第一次世界大战中，就有大量的士兵因生这种病截去了脚，于是“战壕足”一词，开始出现在医学词典里，并且成为这一类冻坏了脚的病的统称了。
    士兵有因这种“战壕足”病而成残废的，至于帝国主义，要生这种病尤其容易。
    中国人民是熟悉“日本的泥足”这样一句话的。那“泥足”两字的涵义，和“战壕足”很相似，它意味着一脚一脚地踏下去，终于拔不出来。日本帝国主义者是在中国战场上得了这个“战壕足”的病的，正和纳粹德国在斯大林格勒战场上得了这个病一样。
    生这个病的个人和国家都是这样，表面上，病情看起来并非一下子就严重到怎样，然而却时时刻刻在增长着，等到发现严重的时候，两只脚已经只有锯掉的份儿，害病者只好变成头等残废了。
    英法帝国主义者的军队赖在埃及苏伊士运河区北端不肯走，那花样，使人想到：这两个国家的脚也正逐渐要变成“战壕足”了。
    历史的行程完全和帝国主义者所预期的相反，当艾登喜气洋洋，面有得色地签署侵略埃及的文件时，他预料几天之间就能占领全埃及，但是事实证明一星期的功夫帝国主义军队还无法完全攻陷塞得港。英法参谋本部预料阿拉伯国家不会联合行动起来，然而战火一燃烧，帝国主义在近东的油管就纷纷给切断了，阿拉伯国家表现了空前的一致行动。帝国主义起初以为世界人民的支援只是一句空话，但是最后苏联的严重警告和全世界人民的愤怒呼声终于迫使侵略者下了停火令。这一切事情，有那一椿和艾登、摩勒等人预期的相一致呢？
    现在，英国和法国正在大闹恐慌，苏伊士运河航运中断了。船只都在恢复十九世纪中期的老样子绕道好望角。英法大闹石油恐慌，英国的存油不够二个月用，法国的存油不够三个月用。英国城郊大道的汽车大减特减了。法国开始实行了每周停售汽油两天的办法。来自近东的每吨七英镑的汽油西欧人买不到了。只好买来自美元区的每吨二十一英镑的汽油。美国德克萨斯的油商正在眉开眼笑。而且，随着石油的缺乏和航运的困难，一切问题都飞临到侵略者头上了。生产减缩，物价飞涨，铅、锡、橡胶、羊毛之类的战略物资的储存量都降到“危险点”。一个星期的放火，英国就耗费了军费一亿镑。中、近东石油生产的减少和运费的损失每月是一千三百万镑，还有入口物资运费的增加，生产减缩造成的损失……还都没有计算呢。于是英国的黄金美元储备迅速下降，又是接近了“危险点”。于是，一个月前趾高气扬、顾盼自豪的艾登“病”倒了。
    当战火燃烧起来的时候，英国国内的舆论曾经说这是赌棍在“押一宝”。是的，正像把一个银角子投进“吃角子老虎”机器里面，引起许多东西跳出来一样，不过跳出来的不是什么银角子，而是许多“恐慌”罢了。
    一个星期的卖劲放火就把国家累成这个样子，帝国主义的衰老已经是百词莫辩了。现在，侵略者终于被迫宣布从埃及撤兵了。尽管他们的代言人还想徒劳地辩护，但是，这毕竟表明了侵略政策的全部破产。因为，如果苏伊士运河现在马上就清理，通航还得在将近半年之后，而如果赖着不走呢？通航就更遥遥无期。在战场上得不到的东西，在会议桌上也不能得到。在战场和会议桌上都得不到的东西，又那里能够靠耍流氓手段得到呢？英法侵略者如果硬想赖着不肯撤走，他们的“战壕足”终必有溃疡的一日，那时，帝国主义集团中又有两条好汉要继前人之后锯掉双脚了。瞧吧，瞧吧，历史终将证明这一切。锯脚的医生并不止是由埃及人民来担当的。
