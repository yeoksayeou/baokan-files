According to statistics from the Chongqing Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China, as of the 19th, twenty-three factories, mines, enterprises, and schools in the city have handed over a surplus of 2.2 million yuan in construction funds to the state this year.

These units have all carefully calculated their accounts recently and economized in many ways. After careful accounting, the Chongqing Cement Plant has handed over more than 300,000 yuan of surplus funds from technical organizational measures, small-scale basic construction, and new product trial production to the state. Recently, a construction project of the Chongqing Station of the Civil Aviation Administration of China used the machinery and equipment stored in the warehouse and canceled the plan to order imported machinery, and then handed over the remaining 120,000 yuan to the state. Chongqing Power School, Chongqing River Transport School, and Southwest Normal College have also handed over unused funds for the purchase of instruments and equipment, basic construction, and other aspects. The Southwest Academy of Fine Arts originally planned to use the 15,000 yuan of unused funds for laying water pipes this year to purchase accordions and bicycles, etc. After being stopped by the Chongqing Branch of the People's Construction Bank of China, the school also handed over the surplus money.

    重庆市二十三个单位
    多余的建设资金已经上缴给国家
    新华社重庆21日电　据中国人民建设银行重庆分行统计，截至19日，全市已经有二十三个厂矿、企业和学校等单位把今年多余的二百二十万元建设资金上缴给国家。
    这些单位，在最近都认真算了细账，从多方面节约。重庆水泥厂经过认真核算后，已经把从技术组织措施、零星基本建设和新产品试制三项费用中多余的三十多万元资金上缴给国家。最近中国民用航空局重庆站的一项建设工程利用了仓库里存放的机器设备，取消订购进口机器计划以后，把结余的十二万元资金交给了国家。重庆动力学校、重庆河运学校、西南师范学院也把购置仪器设备、基本建设等方面没有用完的资金上缴了。西南美术专科学校原计划把今年没有用完的一万五千元敷设水管的费用，用来购置手风琴、自行车等，经中国人民建设银行重庆分行制止后，这个学校也把多余的钱上缴了。
