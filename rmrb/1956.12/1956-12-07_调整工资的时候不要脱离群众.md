　　Don't Deviate from the Masses When Adjusting Wages
　　Commentator of This Newspaper
    Closely linking with the masses is the guarantee of the Party's continuous victories. In state-owned factories and mines, many enterprise leaders have promoted production and construction smoothly by sharing weal and woe and closely uniting with the workers. However, this does not mean that we are satisfied with everything in terms of connecting with the masses. Judging from the results of the initial assessment of wages for enterprise leaders recently, the fact that some cadres squeezed upwards when grading and increased their wages excessively is a phenomenon that is not conducive to connecting with the masses.
    According to a survey by the Ministry of Labor, in various regions and enterprises, the wage increases of most leading cadres above the section chief level exceeded 20% of their original wages, generally increasing by 30% to 40% of their original wages. A few people increased by 60% to 70%, and individual prominent cases reached 100%.
    This is a problem that deserves attention. Although there are many reasons for this high deviation, such as the fact that the enterprise cadre wage scale itself is not well-designed, some enterprise leaders have not been adjusted for several years after being transferred from other positions, and the wages of some management personnel promoted from workers have changed significantly, all of which have brought about high deviation factors in the enterprise wage assessment work. However, if we analyze it specifically, this is not entirely the case. In many cases, it is caused by the one-sidedness in the thinking of some enterprise leaders. Some enterprises disregarded the current wage level and cadre conditions, and only tried to put themselves in the highest level of the wage scale. Some cadres, even though they have already increased their wages by more than 80%, are still dissatisfied because they have not reached the highest grade line and refuse to receive the newly issued wages; some enterprise cadres strive to reach the standards originally stipulated in the wage reform plan for next year (1957) this year (1956), which violates the principle of gradually and rationally adjusting wages. If this practice of disregarding policies and conditions and squeezing upwards and rushing forward is not corrected in time, it will have an adverse impact on the unity of cadres and the connection between the Party and the masses.
    Perhaps some people will ask: Isn't this wage reform aimed at opposing egalitarianism? Isn't the job wage formulated according to the principle of "to each according to his work"? Why should we balance wages on a regional basis? Why is there a maximum percentage increase in wages for each person?
    Indeed, the principle of "to each according to his work" must be reflected in wage issues, and egalitarianism must be opposed. Because egalitarians advocate that regardless of the amount of labor, the quality of work, or the size of contributions to society, everyone should receive the same wages, live in the same houses, eat the same food, and use the same amount of cloth. This is certainly wrong and fundamentally incompatible with socialist principles. However, we also oppose excessive disparities in wage treatment. We should realize that sharing weal and woe with the masses is a long-standing fine tradition of our revolutionary workers. Of course, the current situation and conditions are different from the guerrilla war period, and the treatment can be slightly improved. However, if the responsible personnel, regardless of the living standards of the masses, prominently improve their own treatment, this will cause us to deviate from the masses. This is also incompatible with socialist principles. Therefore, on the issue of wages, we oppose both egalitarianism and excessive disparities.
    Indeed, job wages are formulated according to the principle of "to each according to his work"; from a national perspective, most enterprise leaders meet the requirements of the job wage system. However, in a certain region, an individual unit, or a specific person, there are indeed phenomena where enterprise classification and cadre conditions are not adapted. That is to say, sometimes the level and ability of the director of a second-class factory are not necessarily lower than that of the director of a first-class factory. In this case, if we do not take into account the actual wage level, do not see the specific conditions of the cadres, and do not limit the proportion of wage increases, there will be a phenomenon that cadres with higher levels and stronger abilities will increase their wages too little or not at all, while cadres with lower levels and weaker abilities will suddenly increase too much. If the problem of squeezing upwards across the board occurs again, it will further increase the degree of imbalance and unreasonableness between various types of personnel within enterprises and between enterprises. Therefore, local Party organizations (because they know the situation of the cadres most clearly) need to balance the situation to avoid leading cadres increasing too much at one time and causing dissatisfaction among the masses.
    The relationship between our enterprise leaders and the masses is generally good. Among them, many are old cadres who have been tested through long-term struggles and have lived a supply system life for a long time, maintaining the closest connection with the masses in those difficult years. After they transferred to enterprises from various different positions, they led the workers to complete the task of restoring and developing production. Especially since this year, the leading cadres of factories and mines in various places have gone deep into workers' residences, visited workers' families, and promptly solved many practical difficulties in the lives of employees. At the same time, generally speaking, the treatment of enterprise leaders is not very high. Nevertheless, if a local area does not consider a task thoroughly or does it inappropriately, it will be detrimental to connecting with the masses, and the noble quality of a Communist Party member should be to never deviate from the masses and to work more without being calculative about personal gains and losses. Therefore, every enterprise leader should continue to carry forward the spirit of "worrying about the world's troubles before others, and enjoying the world's happiness after others," closely connect with the masses, be diligent and thrifty, and run the enterprise well. Party committees at all levels should strengthen political work and, while balancing wage work, fully conduct explanatory work so that everyone consciously adjusts their wages to an appropriate level, thereby achieving the goal of strengthening unity and improving life.

### 调整工资的时候不要脱离群众

　　调整工资的时候不要脱离群众
　　本报评论员
    密切地联系群众，是党不断取得胜利的保证。在国营厂矿中，由于许多企业领导干部，与工人群众同甘共苦，紧密团结，顺利地推进了生产建设。但是，这并不等于说，在联系群众上，处处都令人满意。从最近企业领导干部工资初步评定的结果来看，一部分干部在评级时往上挤，增加工资过多，就是一种不利于联系群众的现象。
    据劳动部调查，各地区各企业，科长以上领导干部中，多数人的工资增长数字超过了本人原工资20％以上，一般是增长本人工资的30％至40％，少数人增长60％至70％，个别突出的达到100％。
    这是值得注意的一个问题。虽然产生这种偏高现象的原因很多，例如企业干部工资等级表本身制定的不尽周到，一部分企业领导干部由其他岗位上调来以后几年来没有调整，一部分由工人提拔的管理人员工资变动较大等等，都给企业评定工资工作带来偏高的因素。但是如果具体分析一下，并不完全如此，在许多情况下，是由于某些企业领导干部思想上的片面性造成的。有的企业脱离了现行工资水平和干部条件，只顾把自己放到工资表中的最高一级，甚至还有个干部虽然已经增加本人工资的80％以上，只因为没有占到最高等级线，就不满意，拒绝领取新补发的工资；有的企业干部把工资改革方案原规定明年（1957年）到达的标准，力求今年（1956年）达到，违背了逐步合理调整工资的原则。这种不顾政策，不顾条件，一律向上挤、往前赶的作法，如果不及时纠正，就会给干部的团结和党与群众的联系带来不利的影响。
    也许有人要问：这次工资改革不是要反对平均主义吗？职务工资不是根据“按劳付酬”的原则制定的吗？为什么还要以地区为单位进行平衡？为什么规定每人增加工资的最高比例数呢？
    不错，在工资问题上必须体现“按劳付酬”的原则，反对平均主义。因为平均主义者主张不分劳动的多少，工作的好坏，对社会贡献的大小，都拿一样的工资，住一样的房子，吃一样的饭，用一样多的布。这当然是不对的，同社会主义原则根本不相容的。但是，在工资待遇问题上我们也反对高低过分悬殊。我们应该认识到，和群众共甘苦，是我国革命工作人员长期的优良传统，当然现在的情况和条件同游击战争时期不同了，待遇可以稍稍提高一些了，但如果负责的工作人员，不顾群众生活水平，突出地提高自己的待遇，这就会使我们脱离群众。这也是同社会主义原则不相容的。因此，我们在工资问题上，既反对平均主义，也反对高低过分悬殊。
    不错，职务工资是根据“按劳付酬”的原则制定的；从全国范围来说，大部分企业领导干部是符合职务工资制要求的。但是，就某一地区、某一个别单位、某一个具体人来说确有企业分类和干部条件不相适应的现象。就是说，有时二类厂的厂长级别和能力并不一定比一类厂的厂长为低。在这种情况下，如果不去照顾到现实的工资水平，不去看到干部的具体条件，不限制工资增长的比例，就会产生原来级别较高能力较强的干部增加工资过少或不能增加，而原来级别较低，能力较差的干部突然过多增加的现象。如果再发生一律向上挤的毛病，就会更加加大企业内部各类人员之间、企业与企业之间不平衡、不合理的程度。因此，就需要地方党组织（因为他们对干部的情况了解的最清楚）进行平衡，以免领导干部一次增加过多，引起群众的不满。
    我们的企业领导干部与群众的关系一般是很好的。在他们中间，有不少人是经过长期斗争考验的老干部，长期过过供给制生活，在那艰苦的岁月里同群众保持了最密切的联系。他们从各种不同岗位转到企业之后，又领导工人群众，完成了恢复和发展生产的任务。特别是今年以来，各地厂矿企业领导干部，深入工人住宅，访问工人家属，及时解决了职工生活上许多实际困难。同时，一般说来企业领导干部待遇并不很高。尽管如此，如果我们一个地方一项工作考虑得不周到，做得不恰当，就会不利于联系群众，而共产党员的崇高品质应该是处处不脱离群众，多作工作不斤斤计较个人的得失。所以每一个企业领导干部应当继续发扬“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”的精神，密切联系群众，克勤克俭，把企业办好。各级党委应该加强政治工作，在平衡工资工作同时，充分进行解释工作，使人人自觉地把自己的工资调整到适当的水平上，从而达到加强团结，提高生活的目的。
