Xinhua News Agency, Rome, December 14th: According to TASS, the Eighth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party concluded the discussion of Togliatti's report on the first item on the agenda -- "Struggling for Italy's Road to Socialism, for a Democratic Government of the Working Class" -- on the morning of the 13th. Togliatti made a concluding speech at the end of the discussion.

　　Many representatives continued to make important speeches at the meetings on the 11th, 12th, and the morning of the 13th.

　　Xie Jia, one of the party leaders, emphasized at the meeting on the 11th that there are forces in Italy at present that can create conditions for the establishment of a democratic government of the working class. However, in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to strive to unite all working people, and the tasks put forward by the Communist Party cannot be accomplished solely by Communist Party members.

　　When talking about the Italian Communist Party's attitude towards the Soviet Union, Xie Jia said that the Italian Communist Party is of one heart and one mind with the Soviet Union, not only because it recognizes the role played by the Soviet Union and its party in the past, but also because it recognizes the important role they play today in the socialist camp and the international labor movement.

　　At the morning meeting on the 12th, Vittorio Vidali, the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of the Trieste region, reported to the Congress on the preparations for the merger of the Communist Party of the Trieste region and the Italian Communist Party. He pointed out that the merger will strengthen the Italian workers' movement.

　　Giuseppe Vittorio, a member of the party's leading body and Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, spoke on the trade union movement. He cited some materials to illustrate the deepening exploitation of the working people by the ruling class. He said that from 1948 to 1955, labor productivity in industry increased by an average of 65.7%, but wage levels only increased by 11.6%, while the profits of some industrial capitalists increased by 700%. At present, the ruling class's attack on the working people is becoming increasingly stubborn. Vittorio said that therefore, it is necessary to establish a new and huge trade union organization to unite all members of various trade unions and workers who have not yet joined any trade union, in order to strengthen the unity of the working people.

　　Giorgio Amendola, Secretary of the Party Secretariat, pointed out in his speech that the most important task of the Italian Communist Party is to oppose sectarianism and reformism within the party. He also said that after critically analyzing our struggles and experiences, the necessity of reforming the party has arisen. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union powerfully promoted this exploration of new things and opened up broad prospects for the world's struggle for socialism.

　　Romano Liuzzi, Secretary-General of the Italian Farm Laborers' Union Federation, said that it is necessary to establish a united front of farm laborers, sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and small landowners under the slogan of striving for land reform, in order to confront the alliance of large landlords and industrial capitalists.

　　During these days of the conference, representatives of the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of Poland, the United Kingdom, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Belgium, Switzerland, Morocco, Austria, the Netherlands, and Israel continued to deliver congratulatory messages to the conference.

　　The conference also successively read congratulatory telegrams from fraternal parties in Germany, Australia, Indonesia, Argentina, North Korea, Greece, and Mongolia.

    意共代表大会结束对陶里亚蒂报告的讨论
    谢嘉说意共同苏联一心一德
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利共产党第八次全国代表大会在13日上午结束了对陶里亚蒂就第一项议程——“为意大利走向社会主义的道路、为劳动阶级的民主政府而奋斗”——所作的报告的讨论。在讨论结束的时候，陶里亚蒂作了总结发言。
    在11日、12日和13日上午的会议上，继续有许多代表作了重要的发言。
    党的领导人之一谢嘉在11日会议上着重指出，目前在意大利是存在着能够为建立劳动阶级民主政府创造条件的力量的。但是，要达到这个目的，必须竭力使全体劳动人民团结起来，共产党所提出来的任务是不能仅仅由共产党员来完成的。
    谢嘉在谈到意大利共产党对苏联的态度的时候说，意大利共产党同苏联一心一德，这不仅是由于承认苏联和它的党在过去所起的作用，而且也是由于承认它们今天在社会主义阵营和国际劳工运动中所起的重大作用。
    在12日的上午会议上，的里雅斯特区共产党总书记维多里奥·维达里向大会报告了的里雅斯特区共产党和意大利共产党准备合并的情况。他指出，合并将加强意大利工人运动。
    党的领导机构成员、意大利总工会总书记朱塞佩·维多里奥在会上谈到工会运动问题。他列举了一些材料说明统治阶级对劳动人民剥削的加深。他说：从1948年到1955年为止，工业方面的劳动生产率平均提高了65.7％，但是，工资水平只提高了11.6％，而有些工业资本家的利润却增加了700％。目前，统治阶级对劳动人民的进攻已日益顽强。维多里奥说，因此，必需成立一个新的庞大的工会组织，把所有各个工会的会员和现在还没有参加任何工会的劳动者组织在一起，以加强劳动人民的团结。
    党的书记处书记乔治·阿门多拉在发言中指出：意大利共产党最重要的任务是反对党内的宗派主义和改良主义。他还说，批判地分析了我们的斗争和经验以后，产生了革新党的必要性。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会有力地推动了这种对新事物的探求，并且为全世界争取社会主义的斗争开辟了广阔的前景。
    意大利雇农工会联合会总书记罗曼奥利说，必须在争取进行土地改革的口号下成立雇农、对分佃农、佃农、小土地所有者的统一阵线，以对抗大地主和工业资本家的联盟。
    在这几天的会议上，继续有波兰、英国、芬兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、比利时、瑞士、摩洛哥、奥地利、荷兰和以色列等国的共产党和工人党的代表向大会致贺词。
    会议还先后宣读了德国、澳大利亚、印度尼西亚、阿根廷、朝鲜、希腊和蒙古等国兄弟党的贺电。
