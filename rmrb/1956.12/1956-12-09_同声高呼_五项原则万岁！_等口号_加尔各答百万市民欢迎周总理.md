Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, December 8th: Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage arrived in Calcutta at 11:30 this morning. They traveled sixty miles by car from Sindri to Asansol, and then flew from Asansol to this largest city in India.

The Chinese guests were welcomed at Dum Dum Airport by the Chief Minister of West Bengal, B.C. Roy.

After the bands played the national anthems of China and India, the distinguished Chinese guests reviewed the guard of honor. Subsequently, the Speaker of the West Bengal Legislative Council, S.K. Chatterjee, the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, S.K. Mukherjee, ministers of various departments of the West Bengal government, consuls of various countries stationed in Calcutta, prominent figures from all walks of life, and representatives of the overseas Chinese community were introduced to the guests.

Today at noon, approximately one million Calcutta residents thronged the streets to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests. As Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long traveled in open cars from Dum Dum Airport to the Governor's residence in the city center, the dense crowds on both sides of the eight-mile-long road continuously cheered them. The sidewalks, the roofs on both sides of the road, balconies, and the scaffolding of buildings under construction were all packed with people. Buses and trucks parked by the side of the road were also full of people, completely submerged by the crowds. Thousands of people also stood on chairs or counters inside shops.

Countless welcome arches and the national flags of China and India made this avenue leading to the city center beautiful and colorful.

Hundreds upon hundreds of Indian policemen, wearing white uniforms and red turbans with red tassels, were busy clearing a path for the guests' cars to pass through.

As the cars carrying the distinguished Chinese guests approached, the welcomers first informed each other, "He's coming!" Then they all excitedly shouted in unison, "Long Live the Five Principles!" "The people of India and China are brothers!" and other slogans. Welcomers standing on balconies showered countless flower petals on the distinguished Chinese guests, who were standing in the open cars with their hands clasped in the Indian manner, and released hundreds of pigeons. Others blew conch shells to express their welcome.

When the distinguished Chinese guests finally arrived at the Governor's residence, many people gathered on the nearby streets and tall buildings, cheering the Chinese guests.

Ms. Padmaja Naidu of the West Bengal government received the Chinese guests at the government building in the city center.

　　同声高呼“五项原则万岁！”等口号
　　加尔各答百万市民欢迎周总理
    新华社加尔各答8日电　周恩来总理、贺龙副总理和他们的随行人员在今天上午十一点三十分到达加尔各答。他们从辛德利乘了六十英里的汽车到达阿散索尔以后，又从阿散索尔乘飞机到达这个印度的最大城市。
    中国客人们在达姆达姆机场受到西孟加拉邦首席部长布·克·罗伊的欢迎。
    在乐队奏过了中国和印度的国歌以后，中国贵宾检阅了仪仗队。接着，西孟加拉邦立法院院长苏·库·查特吉、立法议会议长沙·库·慕克吉、西孟加拉邦政府各部部长、各国驻加尔各答领事，以及各界著名人士和华侨代表被介绍同客人会见。
    今天中午，大约有一百万加尔各答居民拥集在街道上欢迎中国贵宾。周恩来总理和贺龙副总理从达姆达姆机场乘敞篷汽车前往市区的邦长官邸的时候，在八英里长的道路两旁密集的人群不断向他们欢呼。在人行道上、道路两旁的屋顶上、阳台上以及正在修建的房屋的手脚架上都挤满了人群。停在街道旁边的公共汽车和卡车的上面也都站满了人，完全被人群淹没了。还有成千的人站在商店里面的椅子上或柜台上。
    无数的欢迎牌楼和中印两国的国旗使这条通往市区的大道变得美丽多采。
    成百上千个身穿白衣服、头戴有红穗的红头巾的印度警察，忙着打开一条道路以便让客人们的汽车通过。
    当中国贵宾乘坐的汽车驶近的时候，欢迎者先是互相传告“他来了！”随后他们都激动地同声高呼“五项原则万岁！”“印中人民是兄弟！”等口号。站在阳台上的欢迎者把无数花瓣撒在按照印度习惯合十站在敞篷汽车上面的中国贵宾，并且放出了成百只的鸽子。另外有些人吹着海螺表示欢迎。
    在中国贵宾最后到达邦长官邸的时候，附近的街道和高大建筑物上都聚集着许多人群，他们向中国客人们欢呼。
    西孟加拉邦政府的帕德马加·奈都女士在市中心的政府大厦接见了中国客人。
