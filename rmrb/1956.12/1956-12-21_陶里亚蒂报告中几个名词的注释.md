Annotations of Several Terms in Togliatti's Report

	Gramsci
	Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937) was an outstanding leader of the Italian working class and the founder of the Italian Communist Party. In 1921, Gramsci, Togliatti, and other communists broke away from the Socialist Party and established the Italian Communist Party.

	At the Third Congress of the Italian Communist Party in 1926, Gramsci formulated the party's strategy under the fascist dictatorship in Italy. The central slogan of the party was unity: uniting the working class and uniting urban and rural laborers to fight against fascism. In this plan, Gramsci specifically formulated a program to solve the Italian peasant and land problems.

	On November 8, 1926, Gramsci was arrested by the Italian fascist government. After eleven years of imprisonment and cruel torture, he died of illness in prison on April 27, 1937.

	Livorno Congress
	In January 1921, the Italian Socialist Party held its 17th Congress in Livorno, northern Italy. Even before this congress, a communist faction had formed within the Socialist Party. At this congress, the communist faction withdrew from the Italian Socialist Party. On January 21, 1921, they held the First Congress of the Italian Communist Party and established the Italian Communist Party.

	"The Five Days of Milan"
	After Napoleon's defeat, northern Italy was incorporated into the Austrian Empire. In 1848, under the influence of the French Revolution, a revolutionary movement broke out in the Austrian Empire. On March 18 of the same year, the Italians in Milan held an uprising against Austrian rule. Almost unarmed, the people of Milan fought heroically for five days and finally drove the Austrian army out of Milan.

	1919 German Spartacist Revolution
	After World War I, Germany faced a severe political and economic crisis. To ease popular resistance, the German ruling class co-opted the Social Democratic Party into the government. At that time, the "Spartacus League," composed of the left-wing of the Social Democratic Party such as Liebknecht and Luxemburg, disagreed with the right-wing of the Social Democratic Party's betrayal of socialism and continued revolutionary activities. In November 1918, under the call of the "Spartacus League," workers and soldiers launched an uprising, and the German emperor fled abroad. Liebknecht announced the establishment of the Soviet Republic. However, the right-wing of the Social Democratic Party seized the leadership of the Soviet and formed a government that implemented bourgeois policies. As a result, the "Spartacus League" withdrew from the Social Democratic Party and announced the establishment of the German Communist Party in January 1919. Under the leadership of the German Communist Party, 150,000 workers in Berlin held demonstrations and launched an armed uprising on January 5. However, this revolution was brutally suppressed by the Social Democratic government, and the German Communist Party was forced to go underground.

	Italian Constitution
	The Constitution of the Italian Republic was adopted by the Italian Constituent Assembly on December 22, 1947, and came into effect on January 1, 1948. Under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, the Italian people waged a resolute struggle against reactionary forces in the process of formulating the constitution and finally won a democratic constitution that could guarantee the rights of workers. The constitution stipulates that Italy is a democratic republic based on the labor of the people; it stipulates the separation of church and state, land reform, nationalization of monopolies, tax reform, and freedom of speech, publication, and assembly.

	"Italian Social Movement"
	The Italian Social Movement, also known as the Neo-Fascist Party, is an extremely reactionary political party led by generals and officials from the Mussolini era. With the connivance of the United States, these old fascists restarted their activities in 1946 and formally formed a party in 1948. In recent years, this political party and the National Monarchist Party have openly united, and secretly colluded with Catholic Action, supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the policy of arms expansion and war preparations.

	The Betrayal of the Social Democratic Party in 1914
	The Second International, composed of social democratic parties from various European countries, was originally a revolutionary proletarian international organization, but later gradually deteriorated due to taking the path of opportunism. After the outbreak of World War I, the leaders of the Second International called on the proletariat to directly participate in the imperialist war. At that time, the leaders of the social democratic parties in various countries compromised with their own bourgeois governments, and some social democrats even joined their own cabinets. In this way, the social democratic parties of various countries betrayed socialism and turned to social chauvinism and the position of protecting the imperialist bourgeoisie.

	Vanoni Plan
	On January 14, 1955, the Italian government announced a deceptive plan drafted by Vanoni, which aimed to increase the number of employed people in Italy by four million in the ten years after 1955 and turn Italy into an industrialized country like West Germany. The plan stipulated that a total of 3.5 trillion lire (Italian currency) of state and private capital would be continuously invested in agriculture, industry, housing construction, public utilities, public works and other projects within ten years.

	Bera, Sherba, and Seni
	Bera, Sherba, and Seni are all leaders of the Christian Democratic Party. Bera formed the interim "administrative" cabinet of Italy in August 1953 and resigned in January 1954. Sherba served as Prime Minister from February 1954 to June 1955. Seni is the current Prime Minister.

	Saragat
	Saragat is the leader of the Italian Social Democratic Party and currently serves as the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister without Portfolio of Italy.

    陶里亚蒂报告中几个名词的注释
    葛兰西
    安东尼奥·葛兰西（1891—1937年）是意大利工人阶级的卓越领袖，意大利共产党的奠基者。1921年，葛兰西和陶里亚蒂以及其他共产主义者脱离社会党以后建立了意大利共产党。
    在1926年意大利共产党第三次代表大会上，葛兰西制订了在意大利法西斯专政条件下党所采取的策略。党的中心口号就是团结：团结工人阶级、团结城乡劳动者来同法西斯主义进行斗争。在这个计划中，葛兰西特别制定了解决意大利农民和土地问题的纲领。
    1926年11月8日，葛兰西被意大利法西斯政府所逮捕。经过十一年监禁的残酷磨折后，在1937年4月27日，病死在狱中。
    里窝那代表大会
    1921年1月，意大利社会党在意大利北部的里窝那召开了第十七次代表大会。早在这个代表大会召开以前，社会党内就已经形成了一个共产主义派。在这次大会上，共产主义派退出了意大利社会党。他们在1921年1月21日召开了意大利共产党的第一次代表大会，成立了意大利共产党。
    “米兰五日”
    拿破仑夸台以后，意大利北部被并入奥地利帝国。1848年，在法国革命的影响下，奥地利帝国爆发了革命运动。同年3月18日，米兰城的意大利人举行了反对奥地利统治的起义。几乎手无寸铁的米兰人民，经过五天的浴血战斗，终于把奥地利军队赶出了米兰。
    1919年德国斯巴达克革命
    第一次世界大战后，德国国内遭到了严重的政治和经济的危机。德国的统治阶级为了缓和人民的反抗，就拉拢社会民主党参加政府。当时，以社会民主党左派李卜克内西、卢森堡等组成的“斯巴达克同盟”不同意社会民主党右派的这种背叛社会主义的行为，继续进行革命活动。1918年11月在“斯巴达克同盟”号召下，工人、兵士发动了起义，德国皇帝逃亡国外。李卜克内西宣布了苏维埃共和国的成立。但是社会民主党右派夺取了苏维埃的领导权，并组成实行资产阶级政策的政府。于是“斯巴达克同盟”退出了社会民主党而在1919年1月宣布成立德国共产党。在德国共产党领导下，柏林十五万工人在1月5日举行示威并发动武装起义。但是这次革命被社会民主党的政府残酷地镇压下去了，德国共产党被迫转入地下。
    意大利宪法
    意大利共和国宪法在1947年12月22日由意大利制宪议会通过，1948年1月1日起生效。在意大利共产党领导下，意大利人民在制订宪法的过程中向反动力量进行了坚决的斗争，终于争得了一个足以保障劳动者权利的民主的宪法。宪法规定意大利为建立在人民的劳动基础上的民主共和国；规定政教分离，土地改革，垄断企业收归国有，改革税收，言论、出版、集会自由。
    “意大利社会运动”
    意大利社会运动，又叫做新法西斯党，是墨索里尼时代的将军和官员所领导的一个极端反动的政党。在美国的纵容下，这些旧法西斯分子在1946年重新开始活动，1948年正式组党。近年来，这个政党和民族保皇党公开联合，并且同天主教行动会暗中勾结，支持北大西洋公约和扩军备战政策。
    社会民主党在1914年的叛变
    由欧洲各国社会民主党所组成的第二国际，原来是一个革命的无产阶级的国际组织，后来由于走上了机会主义道路而逐渐变质。第一次世界大战爆发后，第二国际的领袖们号召无产阶级直接参加帝国主义战争。当时各国的社会民主党领袖纷纷和本国资产阶级政府妥协，有些社会民主党人还参加了本国的内阁。就这样，各国社会民主党背叛了社会主义，而转上了社会沙文主义和保护帝国主义资产阶级的立场。
    万诺尼计划
    1955年1月14日，意大利政府宣布由万诺尼拟了一个欺骗性计划，要在1955年后的十年当中，使意大利就业人数增加四百万，并把意大利变成像西德那样的工业化国家。计划规定在十年内将总数达三十五亿里拉（意币）的国家和私人资本连续投入农业、工业、住房建设、公用事业、公共工程和其他工程中去。
    贝拉、谢尔巴和塞尼
    贝拉、谢尔巴和塞尼都是天主教民主党的领袖。贝拉曾在1953年8月组成意大利临时性的“行政性”内阁，1954年1月辞职。谢尔巴于1954年2月到1955年6月任总理。塞尼是现任内阁总理。
    萨拉盖特
    萨拉盖特是意大利社会民主党领袖，现任意大利副总理兼不管部部长。
