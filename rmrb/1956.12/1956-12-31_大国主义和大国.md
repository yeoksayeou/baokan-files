Great-Power Chauvinism and Great Power
    Fu Xian
    We must oppose great-power chauvinism, but we must consider the fact that our country is indeed a great power.

    “Vast territory, large population, and abundant resources” has been a long-standing fact. But in the past, when we were oppressed by imperialism, the ignorant and arrogant were self-important based solely on this fact, while some enlightened people felt ashamed because of it. The true meaning of a great power being a great power was not very clear at that time.

    After liberation, especially after entering the period of socialist construction, the true meaning of "vast territory, large population, and abundant resources" has been increasingly and clearly revealed.

    A few years ago, a delegation from a capitalist country visited our country. Once, at a banquet, I asked a gentleman from the Conservative Party what his impressions were after seeing the new China. He pondered for a while, and almost to himself, said in a low voice: "So many people! So many people! So many people!" His voice and attitude gave me a peculiar impression.

    This gentleman had been to China before liberation, but only after coming again after liberation did he seem to discover for the first time that we have "so many people," and he seemed somewhat shocked. Why? At the time, I thought it was simply because after liberation, our six hundred million people had stood up and become the masters of China. Now I think that if this gentleman were to go to Egypt again, he would have the same discovery.

    A large population means great strength, which is the first significance of a great power. This significance has been fully demonstrated in our revolutionary movement and construction endeavors.

    There is also a second significance, which is that a large population requires a lot. This significance has also been revealed to us very clearly by the requirements of the basic socialist economic law. The queuing in the market, the crowding on buses and ships…are things we feel every day in our daily lives. For important means of production such as steel, our current annual output is more than four million tons. At the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, it is expected to reach twelve million tons, but if we want to catch up with the United States economically (calculated per capita), we will need an annual output of 400 million tons.

    I attended a lecture on political economy. The lecturer said that if a society does not expand reproduction, but only maintains simple reproduction, then the people's lives will not only fail to improve, but will even decline. He said this is because the population is constantly growing. For example, in our country, the annual increase is more than ten million, which is equivalent to the entire population of some countries in the world, and these annually increasing populations all have needs. I thought this was in accordance with the facts. But later, some truly Marxist theorists said that this was Malthus's population theory, which is reactionary. Saying "population" is Malthus; saying "population growth requires more, so we must continuously expand reproduction" is a reactionary theory. I was baffled by this criticism.

    A large population requires a lot, which shows that our construction task is arduous; a large population means great strength, which shows that we are capable of completing the task. The problem lies in how to rationally organize and utilize this strength, and there are also difficulties in this regard. In addition, with a large population, waste is also more destructive; with a large population, saving is also more constructive… On many, many issues, we must consider the fact that there are many people.

    The reason why reactionaries are reactionary is that they are blind to the people. Their sins are disregarding the people and their needs at home and abroad, and their failure is due to their disregard for the people and their strength at home and abroad.

    On the issue of people's needs and strengths, large countries and small countries only have quantitative differences, and there is no other inequality. Therefore, socialists also respect the needs of the people of small countries and trust the strength of their people. All kinds of chauvinism and great-power chauvinism have their roots in unintentionally or intentionally treating small countries with an attitude that disregards the people.

    As for socialist countries based on proletarian internationalism, there may sometimes be a tendency towards great-power chauvinism, which is not a matter of disregarding the needs of other countries' people, but of over-believing in the superiority of one's own experience and wanting to impose it on others with good intentions. But in this way, although out of good intentions, one cannot help but underestimate the creative power of the people of other countries.

    大国主义和大国
    弗先
    我们要反对大国主义，但我们要考虑到我们的国家的确是个大国。
    “地广人多，物产丰富”，这是久矣乎的事实了。但在过去，受帝国主义压迫的时候，庸妄之徒，仅以这事实而自大，某些有识之士，则反因这事实而感到可耻。大国之为大国，究竟有什么意义，那时是很不明白的。
    解放以后，特别是进入了社会主义建设时期，“地广人多，物产丰富”的真正意义，这才日益显明地揭示出来了。
    前几年，有一个资本主义国家的代表团来我国访问，有一次，在宴会上，我问一位属于保守党的先生，看到了新中国有何感想？他沉思有顷，几乎是自言自语地、低沉地说：“人多！人多！人多！”他的声音和态度，给了我一个异样的印象。
    这位先生，是曾经到过解放前的我国的，但到解放后再来，才似乎第一次发现了我们“人多”，而且似乎有些吃惊。为什么呢？当时我想，没有别的，只因为解放以后，我们六万万人都站起来了，作为中国的主人站起来了。我现在想，这位先生假如再到埃及去，也会有同样的发现的。
    人多力量大，这是大国的第一个意义；这意义，在我们的革命运动和建设事业中，已经充分表现出来了。
    还有第二个意义，就是人多需要大。这意义，也已经由社会主义基本经济规律的要求对我们揭露得十分清楚了。市场上的排队现象，车、船上的拥挤现象……是日常生活中每天都感到的。重要的生产资料如钢，我们现在的年产量是四百多万吨，第二个五年计划的末年，预计将达到一千二百万吨，但若要在经济上（按人口平均计算）赶上美国，那我们就需要年产四万万吨。
    我听过一次政治经济学的讲演。那讲演者说，一个社会，如果不扩大再生产，而只是维持简单再生产，那么，人民的生活不但不能改善，而且还要下降。他说，这是因为，人口是不断增长的，如我国，每年一增长就是一千多万，等于世界上某些国家的全国人口，而这些每年增长的人口都是有需要的。我以为这话是合乎事实的。但后来有些真正马克思主义理论家，说这是马尔萨斯的人口论，是反动的。一说“人口”就是马尔萨斯；一说“人口增长，需要更大，所以必须不断扩大再生产”，就是反动理论；这种批评，我是莫名其妙的。
    人多需要大，这说明我们的建设任务是艰巨的；人多力量大，这说明我们是能够完成任务的。问题在于如何合理地组织、利用这力量，而在这方面也是有困难的。此外，人多，浪费起来破坏性也大；人多，节约起来建设作用也大；……在许许多多的问题上，我们都要考虑到人多这事实。
    反动派之所以反动，就在于目中无人。他们的罪恶，是无视本国和外国的人及其需要，他们的失败，则由于他们无视本国和外国的人及其力量。
    在人的需要和力量问题上，大国和小国只有数量上的差别，而没有其他的不平等。所以，社会主义者，对于小国，也是尊重他们人民的需要，信任他们人民的力量的。形形色色的沙文主义、大国主义，其根源，都是有意无意地以目中无人的态度对待了小国。
    至于以无产阶级国际主义为基础的社会主义国家，有时也会有大国主义的倾向，则不是无视别国人民的需要的问题，而是过分相信自己的经验的优越性，善意地想强加于人的问题。但这样，虽然出于善意，却也不免低估了别国人民的创造力量了。
