Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 13th. Leaders of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Central Leadership of the Polish United Peasants' Party met on December 10 to discuss issues of cooperation between the two parties. They reached a unanimous agreement on important political and economic questions and released a joint declaration.

The joint declaration stated that the Polish working class and its party have united all progressive and patriotic forces around themselves, thereby creating new conditions for strengthening the alliance of workers and peasants. Poland can only exist and develop as an independent, sovereign state, as a state of worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class, as a socialist country. One of the basic conditions for realizing Poland's smooth development, ensuring the security of its borders, and safeguarding the social achievements of the Polish people is fraternal cooperation with all socialist countries, especially with its great neighbor, the Soviet Union. The Soviet-Polish talks held in Moscow in November have opened a new era for Soviet-Polish friendship. The leaders of the two parties declared that anything that weakens the worker-peasant alliance, the leading role of the working class in the country, and the fraternal relations between the Soviet Union and Poland is aimed at the foundations of our country's existence and the achievements of the Polish working people.

The joint declaration stated that the basis for the concerted action of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish United Peasants' Party is their common struggle over the past twelve years to strive for independence, consolidate the Polish people's political power, implement land reform and the nationalization of industry, and comprehensively develop and carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The declaration pointed out some deviations and shortcomings that occurred in the past common struggles and in the relationship between the two parties and expressed the need to eliminate these deviations and correct the consequences they have caused. The two parties emphasized that it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against the reactionary forces, because these forces are trying to take advantage of the current domestic situation to subvert the worker-peasant regime and restore the rule of the bourgeoisie, landlords, and foreign trusts in Poland under the guise of superficial "democracy." The two parties believe that, under the new circumstances, the Consultative Committee established for the Polish parliamentary elections, which will serve as a permanent institution, should become a suitable form of cooperation and mutual supervision between them.

In terms of agricultural policy, the two parties will concentrate their efforts on eliminating everything that hinders the worker-peasant alliance and will take measures to strengthen and consolidate this alliance. The two parties firmly believe that it is necessary to correct the mistakes made in organizing agricultural cooperatives in the past few years. The two parties believe that the task of agricultural collectivization is to achieve the broadest possible technological development of agriculture, increase production, and increase agricultural income. When establishing agricultural production cooperatives, the principle of complete voluntary participation by farmers must be observed. The grassroots organizations of the two parties should jointly protect the legitimate interests of farmers and combat all illegal phenomena. A broad social movement should be launched among farmers aimed at organizing and developing rural trade, cooperation, and cultural organizations.

The declaration stated that the two parties should jointly fight against the reactionary elements, troublemakers, and agitators who attempt to undermine the foundations of the worker-peasant alliance and the strength of the people's state.

The declaration addressed the issue of the upcoming parliamentary election campaign. The declaration stated that the leaders of the two parties believe that the parliament should truly fulfill the tasks of the highest legislative body and supervising the government as stipulated by the constitution. The two parties will jointly campaign for the parliamentary elections under the slogan of strengthening the unity of Poland's progressive forces.

The declaration concluded by addressing the issue of youth.

The declaration was signed on behalf of the two parties by Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, and Ignacy Loga-Sowiński, Chairman of the Central Committee of the United Peasants' Party.

    波兰统一工人党和统一农民党发表共同宣言
    加强两党合作巩固工农联盟
    新华社华沙13日电　波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局和波兰统一农民党中央领导机构的领导人12月10日进行了会晤，商谈了两党合作的问题。他们就重要的政治和经济问题达成了一致协议，并且发表了一项共同宣言。
    共同宣言说，波兰工人阶级及其政党已经把全国一切进步的和爱国的力量团结在自己的周围，从而为加强工人和农民的联盟创造了新的条件。波兰只有作为一个社会主义国家，作为以工人阶级为领导力量的工农联盟国家，才能作为一个独立、主权国家而存在和发展。实现波兰的顺利发展、保证它的边境安全和保障波兰人民的社会成果的基本条件之一，就是同一切社会主义国家的兄弟合作，尤其是同伟大邻邦苏联的合作。11月在莫斯科举行的波苏会谈已经为波苏友谊打开了新时期。两党的领导人声明，一切会使工农联盟、工人阶级在国家中的领导作用、以及波苏兄弟关系受到削弱的事物，矛头都是针对着我们国家生存的基础和波兰劳动人民的成就的。
    共同宣言说，波兰统一工人党和波兰统一农民党一致行动的基础，是十二年来它们争取独立、争取巩固波兰人民政权、实行土地改革和工业国有化及其全面发展和农业社会主义改造的共同斗争。
    宣言指出了在过去的共同斗争和两党的关系中所发生的一些偏差和缺点，并且表示要消灭这些偏差和纠正它所造成的后果。两党着重指出，必须同反动势力作坚决的斗争，因为反动势力正在设法利用目前国内的局势试图推翻工农政权，在表面的“民主”的幌子下在波兰恢复资产阶级、地主和外国托辣斯的统治。两党认为，在新的情况下，为了波兰议会选举而建立的、将作为永久性机构的协商委员会，应该成为它们之间的合作和互相监督的适当形式。
    在农业政策方面，两党将集中力量来消除妨碍工农联盟的一切东西，并且将采取措施来加强和巩固这个联盟。两党坚决认为，必须纠正过去几年中在组织农业合作社方面的错误。两党认为，农业合作化的任务是使农业得到最广泛的技术发展，提高生产和增加农业收入。在建立农业生产合作社的时候，必须遵守农民完全自愿的原则。两党的基层组织应该共同保护农民的合法利益，同一切违法的现象作斗争。在农民中间展开旨在组织和发展农村贸易、合作和文化组织的广泛的社会运动。
    宣言说，两党应当共同进行斗争，反对力图破坏工农联盟的基础和人民国家的力量的反动分子、扰乱分子和煽动分子。
    宣言谈到即将举行的议会选举运动的问题。宣言说，两党领导人认为，议会应当真正履行宪法规定的最高立法和监督政府的任务。两党将在加强波兰进步力量的团结的口号下联合进行议会的竞选。
    宣言最后还谈到了青年问题。
    代表两党在宣言上签字的是：统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡和统一农民党中央委员会主席伊格纳尔。
