Friendly Exchange
By Our Staff Reporter

December 16th was a festival for the border residents of China and Burma, and also a festival of Sino-Burmese friendship.

"The people of China and Burma are one family; nothing can separate us." This was the main theme of the all-day border residents' get-together held today in Mangshi, the capital of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in China. This get-together was of particular significance due to the participation of the two Prime Ministers and other distinguished Burmese guests. The Dai people call this "an unprecedented grand gathering." "Grand gathering" here means great joy.

At 9:30 AM, a gathering between representatives of border residents from China and Burma began in the grand hall next to the square. Eight hundred representatives of various ethnic groups from the Chinese border area gathered here, mingling with more than one hundred ethnic representatives from across the border, engaging in friendly conversations on various topics in their common ethnic languages. The walls of the hall were adorned with Burmese paper-cuts symbolizing peace and friendship: images of elephants and flower baskets.

The Prime Ministers and other distinguished Burmese guests also arrived. Their presence caused a stir, and people stood up and applauded to welcome them, while photographers busied themselves finding suitable angles.

After everyone was seated, Premier Zhou Enlai introduced the Burmese guests and the leaders of various ethnic groups of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture to each other. The newly acquainted friends formed circles and began to chat.

At this time, Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Ba Swe walked up to the representatives of various ethnic groups from the Sino-Burmese border, asking them one by one about their ethnic composition, what languages they spoke, and so on. When he encountered a representative of a Chinese ethnic minority, Premier Zhou introduced him to Prime Minister U Ba Swe; when he encountered a representative of a Burmese border ethnic group, Prime Minister U Ba Swe introduced him to Premier Zhou for a handshake. But soon, this matter became a bit complicated. The residents on both sides of the Sino-Burmese border looked alike and were originally of the same ethnicity, but on the other side of the border, they had a new name. For example, what we call the Dai ethnic group, Burma calls the Shan ethnic group. This relationship of the same ethnicity made it difficult to distinguish some representatives as Burmese or Chinese. The two Prime Ministers laughed, agreeing that the people on both sides were indeed one family, looking the same, dressing the same, and speaking the same language. Premier Zhou intertwined the fingers of his two hands and said to Prime Minister U Ba Swe that the relationship between the two countries was so closely intertwined that it could not be separated. Prime Minister U Ba Swe responded: "Therefore, disputes are not good." The prince of the Kawa ethnic group from Ban Lao came over. Premier Zhou immediately introduced him to Prime Minister U Ba Swe and told Prime Minister U Ba Swe that, due to historical reasons, the two brothers of the prince were separated on both sides of the border, and they very much wanted to be able to live together. Prime Minister U Ba Swe nodded, expressing his understanding of this wish. The conversation between the hosts and guests took place in such an informal and friendly atmosphere.

During the conversation, it was once again proven that there was a traditional close relationship between the border residents of the two countries. It turned out that Si Lashan, the Jingpo ethnic group deputy governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, was a student of Du Wa Zao Lang, the speaker of the Kachin State Assembly in Burma, and a classmate of U Zanhta Sin, the governor of Kachin State. They had studied together for three or four years. Then it was discovered that Xiao Hui Ta's wife, the current speaker of the Burmese Nationalities House of Representatives, and the prince of the Ban Lao Kawa ethnic group were also related. The Speaker's wife explained that her father was very famous, so many people wanted to marry his daughters.

The free and friendly conversation proceeded very enthusiastically, and many representatives of border residents said that such a meeting was very good. He Jia Dang, the vice chairman of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Consultative Committee, said that he had traveled from Liangshan for five days to Mangshi to participate in this grand gathering. In the Liangshan area, the relationship between our border residents and the Burmese border residents is very close. Such a get-together is very good. A representative of Kachin State talked with Lei Chunguo, the vice chairman of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, for a long time. He told Lei Chunguo that he had never been here before, and he was very happy to be with his brothers here this time.

Time passed quickly, and more than three hours had already passed. The border residents' get-together was about to begin in more than an hour, and the friendly gathering came to an end. But some representatives were talking so animatedly that they interrupted their conversations only when the reception staff came to urge them to go to eat.

At this time, the square had become lively, and people from various villages were marching towards the square in teams, beating gongs and drums. The midday sun was still a bit hot, and many people wore Dai bamboo hats, and some women wore a towel on their heads, which could also be regarded as a special costume, which had a sun-shading effect. Many Dai women wore black cloth parasols, which matched their black clothes, black trousers, and black headscarves, forming a distinctive set.

The hot sun and the dust flying due to dryness and trampling did not diminish people's interest at all. More and more people gathered in the square to participate in this grand border residents' get-together.

At 3 PM, the people who attended had already filled half of the square with colorful outfits, and people were still arriving continuously. The total number of people was over ten thousand. In addition to bringing friendly feelings, they also brought several teams of dancers to convey joy and friendship. While waiting for the Prime Ministers, they began to dance in the field. There were Dai elephant leg drum dances, and fish dances from Ruili, where a circle of men and women danced around a person hanging a fish-shaped paper lantern. The costumes of these young men and women, especially the women and the person hanging the fish lantern, were indistinguishable from Burmese national costumes, and the dance movements and hand gestures were very similar to the style of Burmese national dances. The Han people's dragon dance also came dancing.

After 3 PM, the Prime Ministers and distinguished guests ascended the presidium of the conference amidst warm applause from the masses, and the Sino-Burmese border residents' get-together began.

The first part of the program was speeches. All the speeches were filled with cordial and friendly feelings. Prime Minister U Ba Swe's speech was very touching. He pointed out that the people of China and Burma have always regarded each other as relatives, and the relationship between the two governments has always been unusually friendly for two thousand years. China and Burma are like lips and teeth, sharing weal and woe. The friendly relations between the two countries will last forever. He quoted the Burmese proverb, "Respect others, and others will respect you," to compare the significance of establishing and consolidating friendly relations. He reminded the people of China and Burma to prevent interference from foreign conspiracies with an attitude of mutual understanding. The warm applause from the masses many times proved that his words aroused widespread resonance.

Premier Zhou Enlai expressed his welcome to Prime Minister U Ba Swe, and the venue was immediately filled with thunderous applause and cheers. From Prime Minister U Ba Swe's speech, the border residents clearly felt genuine friendship.

Premier Zhou Enlai's speech was sincere and cordial. He described that this get-together was filled with a harmonious and festive atmosphere of brothers and sisters reuniting. He used vivid words to explain the close relationship between the residents on both sides of the border who share the same language and ethnicity. He warned that our country is relatively large and must always be modest and prudent, resolutely oppose great-power chauvinism, adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and develop friendly relations. His words not only touched the hearts of the Chinese border residents but also moved the Burmese guests. When he finished speaking, Prime Minister U Ba Swe shook his hand tightly.

U Zanhta Sin, the Governor of Kachin State in Burma, and Su Bi, the Deputy Governor of Shan State, both emphasized in their brief speeches that the people on both sides of the border have many things in common. Su Bi said that just today, many residents on both sides who came here to participate in the get-together found relatives and had friendly conversations. Their words were echoed by Dao Jingban, the governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and Lei Chunguo, the deputy governor. Opinions were communicated, and friendship flowed smoothly.

One speech after another stirred people's hearts, and there was no sign of fatigue in the field. The speeches ended in a burst of gongs, drums, applause, and cheers.

The several ethnic dances performed after a short break were living proof of the many similarities in culture between China and Burma. It is difficult to say whether our ethnic dances are similar to Burmese ones or Burmese ethnic dances are similar to ours. Indeed, as Prime Minister U Ba Swe said, Burmese culture has Chinese influences, and Chinese culture has also absorbed Burmese elements. China and Burma have been so closely connected for a long time.

The banquet, the last item on the agenda, further advanced this get-together attended by the leaders of the two governments. The banquet began in a normal and peaceful atmosphere. Friendship also became unrestrained. The conversation became more and more enthusiastic and friendly.

The atmosphere of relatives enveloped the various tables, which was not false at all. Dao Jingban, the governor of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, found his relative, U Kun Ong Jia, the Burmese county magistrate, at the front row of tables, and Deputy Governor Si Lashan also found his close relative, Du Wa Zao Lang. In an instant, everyone shouted, "Relatives, cheers, cheers," and others followed them in cheers. At the table of Chinese and Burmese military officers, the voice of Chinese and Burmese military officers being brothers was also heard, followed by the clinking of glasses.

Zhao Kunzhuo, the Governor of Shan State in Burma, excitedly stood up from his seat to say a few words to everyone. He said, "From today's situation, there is no border issue between us. There have been misunderstandings in the past, but now, after the efforts of the Prime Ministers, there is no misunderstanding at all. The most important thing is to develop the friendship between our brothers and sisters, and to develop this friendship. There will never be any difficulties between us." His short and sincere impromptu speech aroused continuous applause. Prime Minister U Ba Swe stood up to speak, emphasizing once again that the relationship between the people of China and Burma is that of friends, relatives, and "Pauk-Phaw" (meaning "compatriot brothers"), and wished the future friendship between the two countries would develop and consolidate day by day. People applauded enthusiastically for every passage of his speech. Premier Zhou Enlai announced the end of the banquet with a warm speech. He said that China and Burma are mountains connected to mountains, water connected to water, living in one place, drinking water from one river, and the border issue cannot separate our relationship as friends, relatives, and "Pauk-Phaw", and now it is even closer. He raised a glass of Moutai wine and proposed to everyone: "Let us all drink another glass of strong wine, watch the songs and dances, have a good sleep, and return to our relatives' country tomorrow." His words won a round of cheers.

During the break before the evening performance, Premier Zhou led the leaders of the Burmese government and states to the courtyard outside, giving them gifts one by one. Among the gifts was a precious orchid. Its evergreen and fragrance are symbols of the eternal development of Sino-Burmese friendship. The courtyard was covered with a layer of pine needles, which, according to Yunnan local customs, is the most solemn welcome. On these pine needles, the Prime Ministers and other government leaders of the two countries stood in a row, arm in arm, and the photographers were busy taking pictures of this scene symbolizing the close unity between China and Burma. At the end of the program, Premier Zhou Enlai accompanied Prime Minister U Ba Swe and his wife and Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein to the stage to present flowers to the actors. They took pictures with the actors. At this time, the tune of the Yangko was heard under the stage. Premier Zhou Enlai, full of enthusiasm, took two Yi ethnic dancing "cigarette boxes" (a musical instrument developed from cigarette boxes) and took the lead in dancing to the rhythm of the music. Prime Minister U Ba Swe, although not familiar with the Chinese Yangko, also followed Premier Zhou and twisted and danced. In an instant, everyone on the stage was involved in this joyful dance. The music played louder, and the people under the stage stepped in time with the beat. This free and unrestrained dance scene continued for several minutes before calming down. The guests and representatives gradually dispersed. The evening party ended. The distinguished Burmese guests will return to Burma tomorrow. But the friendship expressed through this get-together lingers in people's hearts and will never be forgotten.

    友情的交流
    本报记者
    12月16日是中缅两国边境居民联欢的节日，也是中缅友好的节日。
    “中缅人民是一家，没有东西能将我们分离。”——这就是今天在中国德宏傣族景颇族自治州首府芒市进行的全日边民联欢活动的主调。这次联欢，由于两国总理及缅甸其他贵宾的参加而有了特别的意义。傣族人民把这叫做“自古未有的大摆”。大摆在这里也就是大欢乐的意思。
    九时半，在广场旁边的大礼堂里开始了中缅两国边民代表之间的聚会。八百个中国边境各族居民的代表聚集在这里，和从边界那一边来的一百多个民族代表打混在一起，用相通的民族语言友好地交谈着各种话题。礼堂的墙上贴着象征和平友好的缅甸剪纸：一种象和花篮的画案。
    总理们和其他缅甸贵宾也来了。他们的到场，引起一阵活跃，人们都起立鼓掌欢迎，摄影师忙着寻找合适的镜头。
    在大家坐定以后，周恩来总理给缅甸来的贵宾们和德宏傣族景颇族自治州的各族领袖相互作了介绍。新相识的朋友们就围成一圈一圈攀谈起来。
    这时候，周恩来总理和吴巴瑞总理走到了中缅边境各族代表的面前，一一地询问他们的民族成份，讲什么语言等等。遇到中国的少数民族代表，周总理就介绍给吴巴瑞总理；遇到是缅甸的边境民族代表，就由吴巴瑞总理介绍同周总理握手。但是不久，这件事情就变得有点复杂起来。中缅边境两边的居民本来就长得一样，而且本来就是同族，不过到了边界的另一边，有了一个新的名称。例如我们叫傣族，缅甸却把这种民族叫作掸族。这种同族同种的关系使得有些代表很难区别出来是缅甸的还是中国的。两位总理都笑起来了，他们相互同意，两边的人民实在是一家，长得一样，穿着一样，讲的话也一样。周总理把两手手指交叉起来向吴巴瑞总理说，两国人民的关系就是这样密切地交错在一起，分不开的。吴巴瑞总理应声说：所以争执是不好的。斑老地方的佧瓦族王子过来了。周总理立刻把他介绍给了吴巴瑞总理，并且告诉吴巴瑞总理说，因为历史的原因，王子兄弟俩被分隔在边界的两边，他们很想能够搬在一起。吴巴瑞总理点头表示他对这种愿望的谅解。宾主之间的交谈就是在这样不拘形式的友好气氛中进行着。
    在交谈过程中，又一次证明了两国边境居民间有着传统的亲密关系。原来德宏傣族景颇族自治州的景颇族副州长司拉山就是缅甸克钦邦议长杜瓦藻朗的学生，又是克钦邦邦长吴赞塔信的同学，他们曾经同窗过三、四年的时间。接着又发现，缅甸现任民族院议长萧恢塔夫人和斑老佧瓦族王子还有着亲戚的关系。议长夫人解释说，她父亲是名气很大的，所以许多人都愿意娶他的女儿为妻。
    自由友好的交谈进行得非常热烈，许多边民的代表都表示这样的会见很好。德宏傣族景颇族自治州协商委员会副主席盍加当说，他是从凉山用五天的时间赶到芒市来参加这次联欢盛会的。在凉山一带，我们边民和缅方边民的关系是很密切的。这样的联欢很好。一位克钦邦的代表同德宏傣族景颇族自治州副主席雷春国交谈了很久。他对雷春国说，他过去未曾到这边来过，这次来和这边兄弟们在一起感到非常高兴。
    时间不觉已过去了三个多小时。一个多小时以后就要举行边民联欢大会了，友好的会聚才告结束。但是有一些代表在一起谈得非常投机，等到招待人员来催他们去吃饭才把谈话中断。
    这时广场上已经热闹起来，各乡的人民打锣击鼓地一队队向广场走来。正午的太阳晒得人还是有些热的，许多人带着傣族的笠帽，一些妇女头上顶着一块手巾，也算得一种特殊装束，却有遮阳的作用。许多傣族妇女都带着一把黑布的凉伞，同她们的黑衣黑裤黑头巾配成了有特色的一套。
    炎热的太阳和由于干燥和践踏而飞扬的尘土，丝毫不减弱人们的兴致。越来越多的人聚到广场上来参加这次边民联欢的盛会。
    三时，到会的人已花花绿绿地坐满了半个广场，还有人在陆续来到。总计人数在一万以上。他们除了带来了友好的心情，还带来了好几队传达喜悦和友情的舞蹈。在等候总理们的时候，他们就在场子上跳开了。这里有傣族的象脚鼓舞，有瑞丽地方来的鱼舞，由一圈男女围着一个挂着鱼形纸灯的人跳舞。这些男女青年的服饰，特别是女子和挂鱼灯的人的服饰和缅甸民族服饰看不出任何区别，而且舞的身段和手的动作，非常接近于缅甸民族舞蹈的风格。汉族，的龙灯也舞着来了。
    三时过后，总理及贵宾们在群众的热烈掌声中登上了大会主席台，中缅两国边民联欢大会开始了。
    第一部分程序是讲话。所有的发言都贯串着亲切友好的感情。吴巴瑞总理的发言很打动人心。他指出中缅两国人民历来都互相看作亲人，两国政府的关系，二千年来也一直是少有地友好的。中缅两国是唇齿之邦，休戚相关的。两国的友好关系将会万世长存。他引缅甸成语：“敬人者，人亦敬之”，来比喻建立和巩固友好关系的意义。他并非无端地提醒中缅两国人民要以互相谅解的态度来防止外来阴谋的干涉。群众多次的热烈鼓掌证明他的这些话引起了普遍的共鸣。
    周恩来总理向吴巴瑞总理表示了欢迎之意，会场顿时掌声和欢呼声雷动。从吴巴瑞总理的发言中，边民们显然感受到了真切的友情。
    周恩来总理的讲话是诚挚而亲切的，他形容这次联欢大会充满的是兄弟姊妹团聚的和睦喜庆的气氛。他用生动的言语说明边境两边居民同文同族的紧密关系。他告诫我们国家比较大，一定要永远谦虚谨慎，应坚决反对大国沙文主义，坚持五项原则，发展友好关系。他的话不仅打动了中国边民的心，而且感动了缅甸的贵宾们。在他讲完话时，吴巴瑞总理和他紧紧地握手。
    缅甸克钦邦邦长吴赞塔信和掸邦副邦长苏比在他们简短的发言中都强调了边境两边人民有许多共同的地方。苏比说，就在今天，到这里来参加联欢的两边的居民很多人就找到了亲戚，作了友好的谈话。他们的话受到了德宏傣族景颇族自治州州长刀京版和副州长雷春国的呼应。意见都沟通，友谊之流畅通了。
    一个接着一个的发言激荡着人心，场地上看不到困倦的现象。讲话在一片锣鼓、掌声和欢呼声中结束。
    在短时间休息后演出的几个民族舞蹈，都是中缅两国文化上很多相同地方的活的证明。很难说，是我们的民族舞蹈跟缅甸的相像或者是缅甸的民族舞蹈跟我们的相像。的确如吴巴瑞总理所说，缅甸文化中有中国的影响，中国的文化也吸收了缅甸的成份。中缅两国之间长久以来就是这样密切联系着的。
    作为联欢日程最后一项的晚宴，把这一次有两国政府领导人参加的联欢活动又推进了一步。宴会是在正常平静的空气中开始的。友情也奔放起来了。谈话越来越热烈而友好。
    亲戚的气氛笼罩了各个席间，这是一点不假的。德宏傣族景颇族自治州州长刀京版在前一排席间找到了他的亲戚——缅甸县长吴昆翁甲，副州长司拉山也找到了他的近亲杜瓦藻朗。刹那间，大家喊起来“亲戚关系，干杯干杯”，其他的人也随着他们干起杯来。中缅两国军官席上，也发出了中缅两国军官是兄弟的声音，随着而来的是叮叮噹噹的碰杯声。
    缅甸掸邦邦长藻昆卓兴奋地从席间站出来要向大家说几句话，他说：“从今天情形看来，我们之间不存在边境问题，过去有过误解，现在经过总理们的努力，一点误解也没有了。最重要的问题是发展我们兄弟姊妹间的友谊，发展这种友谊。我们之间就决不会存在任何困难”。他的这篇简短而充满真情的即席演说，引起不断的掌声。吴巴瑞总理站起来讲话了，他再一次地强调，中缅两国人民的关系是朋友、亲戚，是胞波（即“同胞兄弟”的意思），并祝两国未来友谊的日益发展和巩固。他的每一段讲话，人们都热烈地鼓掌。周恩来总理以一席热烈的讲话宣布宴会的结束。他说中缅两国是山连山、水连水，住一个地方，喝一条江里的水，边境问题不能把我们这种朋友、亲戚和“胞波”的关系分开，现在更是亲上加亲。他举起一杯茅台酒向大家提议：让我们大家再喝一杯强烈的酒，看完歌舞，睡个好觉，明天再回到我们的亲戚的国家里去。他这席话博得满堂的欢声。
    在晚会演出前的休息时间，周总理引缅甸政府及邦的领导人到外面院子里，一一给他们赠礼。礼品中有一种名贵的兰花。它的四季常青和幽香是中缅友谊永远发展的象征。院子里铺着一层松针，按照云南地方的习惯，这是一种最隆重的欢迎。在这些松针上，两国的总理和其它政府领导人，臂膊紧挽着臂膊地站成一排，摄影记者忙着把这象征着中缅紧密团结的镜头拍了下来。在节目演出完毕时，周恩来总理陪同吴巴瑞总理及夫人和吴觉迎副总理到台上给演员们赠花。他们和演员们在一起照了像。这时台下响起了秧歌的曲调。兴致勃勃的周恩来总理手里拿着两个彝族跳舞用的“烟盒”（一种由烟盒发展而来的乐器）随着音乐的节拍带头就跳了起来，吴巴瑞总理虽然不熟悉中国的秧歌，但是也跟在周总理后面扭舞起来了。顿时，全台上的人都卷进到这欢乐的舞蹈里了。音乐奏的更加响亮，台下的人用步声和着拍子。这一自由不拘的欢舞场面继续了好几分钟才平静下来。客人们和代表们逐渐散了。晚会结束了。缅甸来的贵宾们明天就要回缅甸去。但是通过这次联欢所表露出来的友情却萦绕在人们的心头，将永远不能被遗忘。
