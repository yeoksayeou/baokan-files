Let the Facts Speak

I really enjoyed reading Li Rui's article "The Significance of Power Generation at the Shizitan Hydropower Station" published on page two on October 30th. I don't have a particular interest in hydropower station operations, but I read the article twice in one go because it calmly and irrefutably used facts to criticize the subjectivism in people's minds. This kind of criticism is very powerful. I hope newspapers and periodicals will publish more articles that let the facts speak for themselves, so that those who have made subjectivist errors can sincerely admit their mistakes, know where they went wrong, and be willing to correct them.

Introduce More Information About Minority Areas

Our Korean people in the Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture have increased their understanding and friendship with people of all ethnic groups in the country after various minority delegations came to Yanbian for visits. We are very concerned about their labor and struggle to improve the political, economic, and cultural level of their own ethnic groups. We are very willing to know about the ever-changing construction and transformation of their hometowns, as well as their working methods and experience. Therefore, I hope that newspapers and periodicals will introduce more information about domestic minority areas in the future.

Poems that Extol Heroic Labor

On the train, I finished reading Comrade Xiao Qian's "Ten Thousand Li Sheep Drive" (see pages three on November 21st and 22nd). This is an excellent report and a moving poem. The sons and daughters of all ethnic groups who are engaged in heroic labor for socialist construction should be respected by the people. They are true heroes who dare to do things that no one has ever done before. I seemed to see them standing in the bone-chilling river water melted from ice and snow at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, forming a human bridge, and transporting 1,400 sheep to the other side. I was so moved that I shed tears, and I felt that I was not doing enough work. Their actions saved the country nearly 50,000 yuan, and even more valuable is their patriotism and spirit of not fearing hardship. I hope their deeds can be spread more widely, and it would be best to make a movie.

Editorials Should Be Shorter in Length and Sentences

The editorial "Promote the Style of Hard Work and Simplicity" in your newspaper on November 26th brought a fresh, lively, concise, and pithy form to editorials. In order to clearly explain policies, it is sometimes necessary for editorials to have more words. But I personally extremely hope that your newspaper's editorials in the future will be as short as possible in length and sentences. In this way, just like freeing up housing, there can be more space to accommodate news. Also, the grammar and rhetoric of your newspaper's editorials have played a certain exemplary role, and I hope that it will play a greater exemplary role in the purity and health of the mother tongue.

I Hope Some Translated Works Will Be Selected for Publication on Page Eight

The People's Daily's eighth page publishes too few translated works. I hope that you will selectively publish some translated short stories, poems, one-act plays, or humorous and satirical sketches with profound educational significance, so that we also have the opportunity to appreciate the works of foreign authors and broaden our horizons.

    让事实说话
    我很喜欢读发表在10月30日二版上李锐的一篇文章：“狮子滩水电站发电的意义”。我对水电站的业务并没有特殊兴趣，但是，我抓住这篇文章一口气连读了两遍，就因为它是这样心平气和地但又是不容置疑地，用事实来批判人们头脑中的主观主义。这种批判是非常有力的。希望报刊多发表这种让事实说话的文章，使犯了主观主义错误的人能心悦诚服地承认自己错了，知道错在哪里，并且乐于改正。

    多介绍少数民族地区的情况
    我们延边自治州的朝鲜族人民，在各少数民族参观团来延参观和访问后，更增加了对祖国各族人民的了解和友谊。我们十分关怀他们为提高本民族的政治、经济、文化水平而进行的劳动和斗争。我们非常愿意知道他们家乡的日新月异的建设和改造情况，以及他们的工作方法与经验。因此，我希望今后报刊上能多介绍国内少数民族地区的情况。　（延边　韩昌熙）
    抒写豪迈劳动的诗
    在列车上，我读完了肖乾同志写的“万里赶羊”（见11月21日、22日三版）。这是一篇优秀的报道，也是一首动人的诗。为了社会主义建设而从事豪迈劳动的各族人民子弟，应该受到人民的尊敬，他们是真正的英雄，敢于做从来没有人做过的事情。我仿佛看到在天山下，他们站在冰雪化成的刺骨的河水里，结成人桥，把一千四百只羊运到了彼岸。我感动得流了泪，觉得自己工作做得太少了。他们的行动为国家节省了将近五万元，更可贵的是他们的爱国主义、不畏艰苦的精神。我希望他们的事迹能够更广泛地流传，最好能拍成电影。
                          （李少一）
    社论的篇幅和句子都要短些
    11月26日你报的社论“发扬艰苦朴素的作风”，给社论带来了一种新鲜活泼短小精悍的形式。为了清楚地解释政策，有时社论的字数较多，是必要的。但是我个人极其希望，你报今后的社论尽可能做到篇幅短些，句子短些。这样，便也像腾出住房一样，可以有多一些的篇幅容纳新闻了。还有，你报社论的语法修辞已起一定的示范作用，还希望在祖国语文的纯洁和健康上起更多的示范作用。
                      （高　植）
    希望八版上选刊一些译稿
    人民日报第八版对翻译的作品选刊得太少。希望你们有选择地刊登一些翻译的短篇小说、诗歌、独幕剧或者是富有深刻教育意义的幽默讽刺小品，使我们也有机会能够欣赏国外作者的作品，扩大我们的眼界。（北京俄语学院　白惠忠）
