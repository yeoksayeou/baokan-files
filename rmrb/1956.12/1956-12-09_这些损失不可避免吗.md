　　Are These Losses Inevitable?
　　Lin Xi
　　Recently, I visited the national supervisory departments. According to materials reported by supervisory organs at all levels, some state-owned commercial departments have caused alarming losses to state property due to poor management, improper storage, and inappropriate transportation.
　　Some people say that state-owned commercial departments have a large inventory, and losses are difficult to avoid. Others say that the commercial work has mainly been successful in recent years, so why emphasize those minor shortcomings? However, more people say that while affirming the achievements of commercial departments, and acknowledging that there are indeed many difficulties in commercial work and that some losses are indeed unavoidable, what's wrong with criticizing some avoidable shortcomings, learning lessons, and improving work? Now, I am excerpting and publishing some of the reporting materials from the supervisory departments here. From these materials, people can see whether those so-called unavoidable losses are actually avoidable.
　　In the third quarter of this year, the Gansu Provincial Department of Supervision conducted inspections of department stores in Lanzhou, Tianshui, Wuwei, Yinchuan, and other places, and found that the loss situation of the goods stored in these units was very serious. The Lanzhou Second-Level Department Store Wholesale Station had a backlog of more than 269,000 damaged enamel products, worth more than 370,000 yuan. How did these enamel products become damaged goods? It was because they were stored in the open air and exposed to the sun and rain for a year. In winter, no one poured out the rainwater, which led to ice cracking and eventually rust due to water immersion. More than 280,000 tubes of toothpaste at this wholesale station deteriorated, and the price reduction of deteriorated fruit candy resulted in a loss of more than 230,000 yuan. Wuwei Department Store lost more than 50,000 yuan due to the failure of dry batteries alone. The warehouse of Tianshui Department Store was a rat's nest, where rats reproduced, and many valuable goods were damaged.
　　A recent inspection by the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Supervision of the inventory of goods in department stores and pharmaceutical wholesale stations found that four kinds of goods in the department store wholesale station’s inventory—fruit candy, tape, rubber-soled shoes, and leather shoes—deteriorated due to prolonged backlog and improper storage, resulting in a national loss of more than 780,000 yuan. Tianjin Pharmaceutical Wholesale Station lost 240,000 yuan due to the deterioration of penicillin alone.
　　Weinan Prefectural Department Store in Shaanxi Province had 326 kinds of damaged goods, worth more than 420,000 yuan. At present, milk powder is out of stock in various places, but more than 600 dozen boxes of milk powder and milk substitutes, and 2,000 catties of bulk milk powder stored in this company's warehouse have deteriorated and become rancid. All 40,000 dozen dry batteries are失效 (failed to function); high-grade fruit candy worth more than 20,000 yuan has melted and deteriorated; 28,000 washbasins and 口缸 (drinking vessels) are cracked and rusted...
　　There are many inspection report materials from other regions as well. I think there is no need to list them one by one, because the facts and figures cited above are enough to make people ask: Are these losses really unavoidable?
　　Let's see how the large quantities of penicillin stored in the Tianjin Pharmaceutical Wholesale Station deteriorated. As everyone knows, the efficacy of penicillin has a certain time limit. Therefore, when goods are put into storage, they should be stored separately according to the production date in order to implement the principle of "first in, first out." However, this warehouse would ship out whichever batch was easier to move out first. In other words, the medicines that entered the warehouse first were not shipped out for a long time, and of course, they could only deteriorate. Warehouse keepers may lack knowledge, but do the persons in charge of the pharmaceutical wholesale station also lack this essential knowledge of the industry? If the leaders have explained the principle of "first in, first out" to the staff, why have they allowed the keepers to ship the goods randomly for a long time? Aren't these losses caused by the bureaucracy of the leaders and the lack of a sense of responsibility of the staff?
　　The Lanzhou Second-Level Department Store Wholesale Station put enamel products worth more than 370,000 yuan in the open air, which may be due to a lack of warehouse space. Today, the state cannot spend a lot of money to build warehouses, but necessary storage costs (such as the cost of buying reed mats and canvas) are still available. Then, who should be responsible for allowing state property to be exposed to the sun and rain and failing to clean it up in winter, resulting in losses?
　　Some units do not know what principles they follow when purchasing goods. For example, the Weinan Department Store has an inventory of 900 sets of tricycle tires, 300 sets of inner tubes, and more than 24,000 spokes, while the entire Weinan area has only four tricycles. We know that the effective shelf life of dry batteries is generally half a year, but this company purchased 210,000 dozen at one time last year. After selling for nearly a year, there are still more than 120,000 dozen in the warehouse, most of which have expired. Obviously, if the commercial departments investigated the needs of social consumption when purchasing goods, these losses could have been completely avoided!

### 这些损失不可避免吗

　　这些损失不可避免吗
　　林晰
    最近，我访问了国家的监察部门。从各级监察机关上报的材料来看，一些国营商业部门由于不善经营和保管调运不当，给国家财产造成的损失是惊人的。
    有些人说，国营商业部门的家当大，损失很难避免；还有人说，商业工作在几年来成绩是主要的，何必强调那一小点缺点？但是更多的人说，要肯定商业部门的成绩，商业工作中确实有许多困难，有些损失也确实不可避免，但是，对于一些可以避免的缺点进行批评，接受教训，改进工作，有什么不好呢？现在把监察部门的报告材料，摘录一部分发表在这里。从这些材料，人们可以看到那些所谓不可避免的损失，究竟是不是可以避免的？
    甘肃省监察厅在今年第三季度，对兰州、天水、武威、银川等地的百货公司进行了检查，发现这些单位保管的商品，损失情况很严重。兰州二级百货批发站积存有二十六万九千多个残损的搪瓷品，约值三十七万多元。这些搪瓷品怎么变成残损商品了呢？是由于在露天存放，任凭日晒雨淋了一年的时间，到冬天也没有人把雨水倒出来，以致结冰裂纹，最后又浸水生锈了。这个批发站的牙膏变质的有二十八万多支，水果糖变质降价损失了二十三万多元。武威百货公司仅干电池失效损失了五万元以上。天水百货公司的仓库是鼠窝，老鼠在这里传种接代，许多高贵的商品都被咬坏了。
    天津市监察局最近对百货、医药批发站库存商品的检查，发现百货批发站库存的水果糖、胶带、胶底鞋、皮鞋四种商品，因为积压过久，保管不当而变质，国家因此损失七十八万多元；天津医药批发站仅青霉素一项变质，损失了二十四万元。
    陕西省渭南专区百货公司残损商品三百二十六种，价值四十二万多元。目前各地奶粉脱销，而积存在这个公司仓库里的六百多打奶粉和代乳粉，二千斤散装奶粉都变质发臭了。四万打干电池全部失效；价值二万多元的高级水果糖溶化变质；二万八千个面盆、口缸裂纹生锈……。
    这里还有许多地区的检查报告材料。我想，用不着一一列举了，因为上面引述的那些事实和数字足以叫人发问：这些损失真是不可避免吗？
    让我们看看天津医药批发站库存的大批青霉素是怎样变质的吧。大家都知道，青霉素的疗效有一定的期限，因此，在货物进库时要按出厂日垛分别保管，以便执行“先进先出”的原则，但是这个仓库却根据那一期货方便搬出，就先发出那垛货，就是说，先进库的药品长期发不出去，当然只有变质一途了。仓库保管员也许缺乏知识，但是医药批发站的负责人竟也缺乏这种本行必备的知识吗？如果领导人员对下级工作人员交待过“先进先出”的发货原则，为什么又长期听任保管人员乱发货物呢？这些损失难道不是由于领导人员官僚主义和下级工作人员责任心不强所造成的吗？
    兰州二级百货批发站把价值三十七万多元的搪瓷品放在露天里，这可能是由于缺乏库房，今天国家不可能花很多钱来修建库房，但是必要的保管费用（例如买些苇席和帆布之类的费用）还是有的。那么，任凭国家财富日晒雨淋，到冬季也不加清整，结果遭受损失的责任应该由谁来负呢？
    有些单位进货不知道是根据什么原则，像渭南百货公司库存有三轮车外胎九百付、内胎三百付，车条二万四千多根，而整个渭南地区却有四辆三轮车。我们知道，干电池的有效期限一般是半年，而这个公司在去年一次就购进二十一万打，销了将近一年，仓库里还积压十二万多打，其中大部分已经失效了。很明显，如果商业部门在进货时调查了社会消费的需要情况，这些损失完全是可以避免的啊！
