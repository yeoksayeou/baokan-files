Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 7th: The harvesting of crops in rural areas throughout Hungary is almost complete, and sowing and plowing work in most parts of the country has also been completed.

Hungary's sugar beet harvest has been completed. Each sugar factory has refined ten train cars of sugar beets into sugar. In terms of sowing, the Szolnok region plans to sow 205,000 holds of land, and only 25,000 holds remain to be sown.

The Csongrád region has sown grains on 150,000 holds of land, which is equal to the average sowing area of ​​the region in recent years. The autumn sowing work of state-owned farms is also progressing smoothly.

After this incident, many farmers in Hungary are still willing to operate on the principle of collective labor. In Somogy County, thirty to forty of the best cooperatives are still operating as usual. The "Liberation", "Rakosi", and "Pioneer" cooperatives in Csongrád County have received a large number of applications from farmers requesting to join the cooperatives. However, in Szolnok County, 30% to 35% of agricultural cooperatives have dissolved, and in Győr County, 50% of the cooperatives have dissolved.

    秋收完后忙播种
　　匈牙利农村生产情况良好
    许多农民仍然愿意集体经营
    据新华社布达佩斯7日电　匈牙利各地农村的农作物的收获工作差不多都已结束，全国大部分地区的播种工作和犁地工作也已完成。
    匈牙利的甜菜收获工作已经完成。各制糖厂已经把十个车皮的甜菜提炼成糖。在播种工作方面，索尔诺克计划要播种二十万五千霍尔德土地，现在只剩了二万五千霍尔德还没有播上种子。
    琼格拉德州播种了十五万霍尔德土地面积的谷物，这等于这个州几年来的平均播种面积。各国营农场的秋季播种工作也在顺利进行。
    经过这次事件以后，匈牙利的许多农民仍然愿意在集体劳动的原则上经营。在绍莫吉州，有三、四十个最好合作社仍然照常在工作。琼格拉德州的“解放”、“拉科齐”、“先锋”等合作社，已经收到大量农民要求加入合作社的申请书。但是，在索奴州，有30％到35％的农业合作社解散，在吉厄尔州有50％的合作社解散了。
