    On Giving Books as Gifts
  　Huang Zhifeng
    Nowadays, on the one hand, readers are complaining that books are expensive, and publishing departments are complaining about the lack of paper. But on the other hand, publishing houses are giving away a considerable number of newly published books. It's not that books and periodicals can't be given away, but giving them away too "indiscriminately" is a kind of waste. The recently published, rather expensive albums are one example. I strongly suspect that publishers are being generous at the state's expense!
    Not long ago, I read an article by Ms. Xu Guangping, "Lu Xun's Daily Life" (see Wen Hui Bao, October 9), which mentioned that Lu Xun needed to buy a "Sibu Congkan" or similar book for reference when compiling "A History of Chinese Literature," "But when he heard that it would cost several hundred yuan, Lu Xun hesitated for a long time. Later, I persuaded him: We can save on other things, but we should still buy reference books! Only then did he grit his teeth and buy it." Some of those who receive free books may have a business relationship with publishing, and some may not. Even those who do may not need to do special research on certain books, but publishers send them a copy of every book they publish.
    If one can receive free books simply by virtue of their position, then over time, even if the government allocates ten more rooms, I'm afraid they won't be able to accommodate all these gifts.
    Books will probably still be given away in the future, and they need to be given away. But I believe that it should have some relationship to the editing of the book. Either they have contributed ideas to the compilation of the book, or they have proofread it, or they have reviewed the manuscript, or they need to be asked to critique and introduce it. In short, they have put in some labor for the book or are prepared to put in some labor. Just as Hu Zhongchi mentioned in the People's Daily on October 11 about his work on publishing the "Complete Works of Lu Xun" in Shanghai in 1938, he later "received his own copy," which is perfectly reasonable.
    Nowadays, publishing houses and magazine editorial departments all give away books and periodicals. I suggest that they specifically consider the content of the books and periodicals and the recipients according to the principle of thrift, so that this work can be improved. Indiscriminate giving will increase the cost of books and periodicals, which means it will unnecessarily increase the burden on readers!

    论赠书
  　黄栉风
    如今一方面是读者嚷着书贵，出版部门嚷纸张缺乏，但另一方面，出版社赠送的新出书籍却也为数不少。不是说书刊不能赠送，但赠送得太“滥”了，就是一种浪费。不久前出版的价格相当贵的画册，就是一例。我很怀疑，出版社是否在慷国家之慨！
    不久前读到许广平先生写的“鲁迅的日常生活”一文（见10月9日文汇报），其中提到鲁迅先生为了编“中国文学史”需要买一部“四部丛刊”之类的书来参考，“但是一听说需要花几百块钱的时候，鲁迅就曾经踌躇过很久，后来还是我劝他说：我们在其他方面可以节省一些，参考书籍还是去买吧！他才发了狠心买了下来。”收到赠书的人，有的在业务上也许同出版有关系，有的也许没有。有关系的，也许对某一些书并无特别研究的必要，但是出版社却凡出书必送一本。
    如果按地位就可以得到赠书，那么久而久之，即便公家再拨给他十间房子，恐怕也会容纳不下这些赠品的。
    书，今后大概也还是要赠的，也需要赠的。但我以为，多少应该与该书的编务有点关系。或对编纂该书出过主意，或代为校勘，或审改过稿子，或需请他批评介绍之类。总之，是为该书付出过一定的劳动或准备要付出一定劳动的。正如10月11日人民日报载胡仲持同志记1938年在上海搞“鲁迅全集”的出版工作时，后来便“领到了我的一部”，这就是完全合理的了。
    如今的出版社、刊物编辑部，都要赠书、赠刊物，我建议他们按节约原则把书刊内容、赠送的对象，分别具体考虑一下，使这项工作有一些改进。滥赠的结果，会增加书刊的成本，也就是说，会不必要地增加读者的负担！
