　　Who could believe that an ordinary warehouse clerk could step through the doors of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and become a young researcher with many inventions to his name? This is a fact, and it happened to Cao Zhenhua of the Shanghai Anda Textile Factory.
　　Ten years ago, Cao Zhenhua graduated from middle school. When he learned that he could not continue his studies, he felt disappointed. On the way to seeing off several classmates who were going to take the university entrance exams, he secretly shed tears!
　　"Zhenhua, fortunately, God blesses, the Anda Yarn Factory is adding apprentices…." Cao Zhenhua's father told him the news. Cao Zhenhua jumped up with excitement. He had always liked tinkering with various gadgets, and he always rushed to be the first to do physics and chemistry experiments at school, and now he had the opportunity to learn technology. Who knew, he was assigned to the warehouse to do warehouse work.
　　Soon after arriving at the warehouse, a lively young man suddenly became silent, recording only the numbers of raw cotton entering and leaving. He couldn't bear it and asked to be transferred to the workshop. One day, he plucked up his courage and walked into the factory director's office, timidly telling him his thoughts. The factory director glanced at him and said nonchalantly:
　　"Want to go to the workshop, what skills do you have?" With a bang, Cao Zhenhua felt like he had been hit on the head, and silently retreated.
　　The frustration at work could not change his enthusiasm for learning. He used all his spare time to study radio technology, and he would buy books and magazines related to telecommunications technology and the necessary tools for assembling radios whenever he had money. From then on, it seemed that his spirit had a place to rest. Gradually, he could not only assemble and disassemble radios, but also design new circuits. He assembled a radio receiver for himself. He also often volunteered to repair damaged radio parts for his colleagues in the factory. Older people sighed for him: if he could work in the workshop, what great achievements he would have.
　　After Liberation, he joined the Communist Youth League and also served as the leader of the trade union group. At this time, he already had a certain foundation in telecommunications technology.
　　In a casual conversation with the director of the medical clinic, he learned that the factory lacked an ultra-shortwave electrotherapy machine, which was not only expensive, but also difficult to buy on the market. Cao Zhenhua thought: anyway, it applies the principles of radio, why not make one myself! He read many technical books and, through various relationships, went to an electrical appliance factory to take a look. It would have been better if he hadn't looked, but after seeing it, he couldn't help but be shocked. Usually, he tinkered with small light bulbs (vacuum tubes), but the bulbs in the electrotherapy machine were so big that two hands could not cover them completely, and he felt a little scared; but he still bravely and silently remembered the internal device. He came back and began a tense trial production. His enthusiasm overwhelmed all difficulties. As soon as he got off work, he ran to the dormitory, winding square sheds and connecting coils. Five months later, this ultra-shortwave electrotherapy machine was successfully imitated.
　　Soon, in order to test the moisture content of raw cotton, the factory bought a Swiss-made electric moisture meter, but one was not enough. According to the production needs at the time, at least three were needed, but they could not buy them anymore. Cao Zhenhua's heart stirred again after hearing this news. He remembered reading about this kind of moisture meter in a magazine, why not try to make one? At that time, the factory director even warned him, "A moisture meter is not like an electrotherapy machine, this is a high-level instrument, only one manufacturer in Switzerland makes it."
　　Cao Zhenhua returned to his room and stared blankly at the books that had been worn out by him. "Can foreigners do it, and Chinese people can't do it?" His heart became hot again, and he secretly ran into the factory director's office and disassembled the Swiss-made moisture meter, carefully examining it up and down, inside and out for a long time.
　　He decided to make one like it, but he was unwilling to make this matter public, fearing that others would say that he was arrogant and conceited, so he groped in secret by himself; of course, no one had ever succeeded in doing this. Not to mention the technical difficulties encountered, the first problem to be solved was funding and time. For his ideals, he sold some of his personal savings of radio parts to exchange for the things needed for the trial production. The time problem was the most difficult to solve. Of course, he couldn't do it during production, and there were many meetings at night, so he could only ask for leave on the pretext, which of course gave people a bad impression, but he didn't care about these, and every day he went to his small room in his spare time.
　　After six months, he finally made the moisture meter.
　　At this time, the factory was preparing for joint state-private ownership. With the development of production, the factory urgently needed to add a moisture meter. Coincidentally, a batch of foreign goods came on the market, and some people urged the factory to buy them quickly. At that time, the chairman of the trade union disagreed and said: "Buying one costs more than 1,000 yuan, and Cao Zhenhua makes one for only more than 200 yuan, so his one should be tried!" When Cao Zhenhua carried the moisture meter to the workshop, everyone was stunned by its beautiful and sturdy appearance. After a field test, it proved to be completely applicable. Cao Zhenhua was not satisfied with his achievements, he felt that this moisture meter was very inconvenient to use because it used alternating current, and there was always a long wire dragging behind it, and you could get an electric shock if you weren't careful. Therefore, he wanted to make a moisture meter that used direct current.
　　The factory was officially merged, and the original chairman of the trade union was appointed as the public factory director. Cao Zhenhua told him his wish. The public factory director listened, patted him on the arm, asked him to work hard, and promised that the factory would allocate some trial production funds to him. Of course, this trial production went relatively smoothly. More than two months later, the instrument was successfully trial-produced, and it was more convenient to use than foreign goods.
　　During the production reform and organizational adjustment, the factory transferred him to the laboratory to serve as a raw cotton inspection technician. His wish was realized, and he was grateful for the Party's care for him, and his work enthusiasm was even higher.
　　In his daily raw cotton inspection work, he felt that there was a lack of a precision balance. He accidentally saw something similar in a foreign magazine, and he wanted to try to make it again. At that time, the Czechoslovak Ten-Year Construction Achievement Exhibition had just opened in Shanghai. He went to visit and unexpectedly found an electric differential balance, which was written in the manual that it could weigh a strand of hair. This discovery attracted him, and he kept spinning around the glass window. He asked the explainer to take it out and let him take a closer look, but they disagreed. Standing next to the window, his head was lowered on the glass, watching and watching, I don't know if it was because he was dizzy or what, he bumped his head on it. With a "bang", the people next to him looked at him in surprise, and the explainer also came over to interfere, which made him feel very embarrassed, wanting to slip away but unable to slip away, his face turned red. Just at this time, a Czechoslovak expert came over and looked at him kindly, asking him what was the matter, and he was even more embarrassed. At this time, the Czechoslovak expert was very happy to take him to the technical information desk, talked to him in detail about the function of the balance, and also gave him a technical material. He gratefully grasped the expert's hand tightly and said thank you more than a dozen times before walking away excitedly. Three months later, a completely new electric differential balance was born in China.
　　Last summer, the experimental worker Yao Qiuzhen pointed to a pile of raw cotton in front of her and complained to Cao Zhenhua with a sad face: "There is so much work, how can I do it..." Cao Zhenhua looked at Yao Qiuzhen's stiff fingers, what to do? It turned out that last year, because there was not enough raw cotton, domestic yarn factories had to mix in frost-yellow flower peeled peach cotton. The quality of this cotton was not good, so it had to be sampled and inspected batch by batch, and the inspection work was doubled.
　　Good news came, Beijing held a Hungarian textile instrument exhibition. The comrades who visited the factory brought back a catalog of exhibits, and he found that there was a polarized light microscope raw cotton maturity analyzer, which was the latest scientific achievement. So he wanted to imitate this instrument again. This involved advanced optical theory. But what should he do if he didn't know anything about it?
　　In a Textile Bulletin magazine, he saw a special report on polarized light microscopes written by Hungarian experts. He bought several books on the theory of polarized light and lenses at second-hand stalls. In order to overcome the difficulty of not understanding Russian, he bought a dictionary and translated it word by word, referring to the illustrations in the book. He did more than eighty experiments in a row, and at the end of November last year, he succeeded.
　　In March of this year, comrades from the Technology Department of the Ministry of Textile Industry came to Anda No. 1 Factory and highly praised Cao Zhenhua's newly created instrument, and encouraged him to make further improvements to achieve higher requirements.
　　The leaders of the factory also attached great importance to it, helping him to inquire at various optical instrument factories in Shanghai, and designated a fitter to help him get some parts or something.
　　With the help of Zhao Yuan, a technical consultant from Shanghai Comprehensive Instrument Factory and a professor at Zhejiang University, Cao Zhenhua successfully created a display-type raw cotton maturity analyzer in just over 20 days, and the cost was very low, only two lenses and a reflector, costing about 20 yuan in total.
　　In May, Cao Zhenhua attended the National Congress of Advanced Producers. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also selected him as a youth production shock worker. He received such an honor for the first time and shed tears of excitement.
　　Cao Zhenhua used creative labor to bring himself into the door of scientific research. On the eve of his upcoming report to the Shanghai Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I found him. I congratulated him, shook his hand tightly, and asked him: "What are your thoughts on this transfer?"
　　He was silent for a long time without speaking. I was thinking about how to enlighten him when he suddenly squinted his eyes and said to me mischievously, "Some people say that I will develop terrible complacency. Do you think I will be complacent?" He then sighed softly: "What do I have to be complacent about? There are many experts in Shanghai. It takes me years to make something, but people just don't think about doing it, it's not easy to do!"

    谁能相信一个普通的仓库栈务员，能够踏上中国科学院的大门，成为一名已经拥有许多发明创造的青年研究员呢。这是事实，这件事发生在上海安达纺织一厂曹振华的身上。
    十年前，曹振华中学毕业了，当他知道自己不能继续升学的时候，感到失望。在欢送几个同学去投考大学的路上，他偷偷地流泪了！
    “振华，总算老天保佑，安达纱厂要添练习生……。”曹振华的父亲告诉了他这个消息。曹振华兴奋得跳起来了。向来喜欢弄弄各种小玩意，在学校里做理化实验，总是抢在头里，这一下倒有机会学习技术了。谁知，他竟被分配到仓库里做栈务工作。
    来到仓库不久，一个鲜蹦活跳的青年突然变得沉默了，每天只是记录记录原棉的进出数字。他不能忍耐，要求调动到车间去工作。一天，他鼓足了勇气走进厂长室，畏畏缩缩地说出了自己的心事。厂长扫了他一眼，带理不理地对他说：
  “想到车间里去，你有啥技术？”轰的一下，曹振华像被人当头敲了一棒，默默地退了出来。
    工作的不如意不能改变他的学习热情，利用全部业余时间研究无线电，有钱就去买一些有关电讯技术的书刊、装修无线电必要的工具。从此，似乎精神有了寄托。慢慢地他不但能装拆无线电，也会设计新线路，他替自己装了一架无线电收音机。还时常自告奋勇替厂里的同事们修理损坏了的无线电机件。年纪大一些的人为他叹息：要是能到车间里去工作，会有多大的出息。
    解放了，他参加了青年团，还担任了工会小组长。这时他对电讯技术已经有了一定的基础。
    在一次和医务室主任的闲谈中，他得知厂里缺少一架超短波电疗机，价钱贵不说，苦的是市面上买不到。曹振华心想：反正是应用无线电原理嘛，自己来做一架吧！他翻阅了许多技术书籍，又通过各种关系到一家电器厂里去看过一次。不看犹可，看过以后，不由得大吃一惊，平常弄的是小灯泡（真空管），电疗机里的灯泡却大得两只手都遮不满，心里怕瑟瑟的；但他还是硬着头皮默默地记下了内部的装置。回来就开始了紧张的试作。他的热情压倒了一切困难。一下班就往宿舍里跑，又是绕方棚，又是接线圈。五个月后，这架超短波电疗机仿制成功了。
    不久，厂里为了检验原棉含水率，买了一架瑞士造的电动测湿仪，但是一架不够用，根据当时生产需要，起码得三架，要再买又买不到。曹振华得知这个消息后，心里又动了。他记得在一本杂志上曾看过关于这种测湿仪的介绍，何不试着做做看呢。当时厂长还警告他说：“测湿仪可不比电疗机，这是高级仪器，瑞士也只有一家厂商制造。”
    曹振华回到房间里，望着几本被他翻烂了的书籍发呆。“难道外国人能做，中国人就不能做吗？”他的心又炽热起来了，偷偷地跑进厂长室，把那架瑞士造的测湿仪拆开来，上上下下，里里外外，仔细端详了好半天。
    他决定照样做一架，但是他不愿意把这事公开，怕别人又要讲他骄傲狂妄，便一个人暗地里摸索；当然，从来是没有一个人做成的事情的，技术上遭遇到的困难不去说，首先要解决的问题一是经费，一是时间。他为了自己的理想，把个人蓄存的一些无线电零件出卖，换取了试制需要的东西。时间问题最难解决，生产时当然不能搞，晚上呢，会议多，他只能借故请假，这给人的印象当然不好，但他不管这些，每天一到业余就钻到小房间里去了。
    前后经过了六个月，他终于把这架测湿仪制造成功了。
    这时工厂正在筹备公私合营。随着生产的发展，厂里急需添置一架测湿仪，刚巧市场上来了一批外国货，有人催着厂方赶快去买。当时工会主席表示不同意，并说：“买一架要一千多元，曹振华做一架只花二百多元，应该让他的这架试用一下！”等到曹振华拎着这架测湿仪到车间来的时候，大家一看就被它的美丽坚实的外表惊呆了，实地一试验，证明完全适用。曹振华并不满足自己的成就，他感到这架测湿仪使用很不方便，因为它用的是交流电，背后总拖一根长长的电线，一不小心就会触电。因此他想做一只用直流电的测湿仪。
    工厂正式合营了，原来的工会主席被委派作公方厂长，曹振华就把自己的心愿告诉了他。公方厂长听了，拍拍他的臂膀，要他好好干，还答应由厂里拨出一部分试制经费给他。当然这次试制工作比较顺利，两个多月后，这架仪器就试制成功了，使用起来比外国货还方便。
    在生产改革调整组织的时候，厂里把他调到试验科担任原棉检验技术员，他的愿望实现了，他感激党对他的关怀，工作积极性更高了。
    在日常原棉检验工作中，他觉得缺少一只精密天平。偶然在一本外国杂志上看到了类似的东西，他又想试着做。那时刚巧捷克斯洛伐克十年建设成就展览会在上海开幕，他去参观，意外地发现一架电动微分天平，说明书上写着能称一根头发丝的重量。这一发现吸引了他，他围着玻璃橱窗直打转，他要求讲解员能拿出来给他仔细看一看，人家不同意，站在橱窗旁边，头俯在玻璃上，看啊看的，不知是由于气昏了呢还是怎么的，他一头撞在上面。“乒乓”一声，旁边的人都惊奇的瞧着他，讲解员也过来干涉了，这使他感到十分尴尬，想蹓又蹓不掉，脸变得通红。正在这时候，捷克斯洛伐克专家走了过来，和蔼地望着他，问他有什么事，他更窘了。这时，捷克斯洛伐克专家非常高兴地带他到技术问讯处，详细地对他谈了那架天平的功用，还送给他一份技术资料。他感激得紧紧握住了专家的手，连说了十几声谢谢，就兴冲冲地走了。三个月以后，一架完全新颖的电动微分天平就在国内诞生了。
    去年夏天试验工姚秋珍指着面前一堆原棉，哭丧着脸对曹振华诉苦说：“这么多活，瞧怎么干的了……”曹振华望着姚秋珍僵硬的手指，怎么办呢？原来去年因为原棉不够，国内各纱厂都要羼用霜黄花剥桃棉，这棉花品质不好，不得不逐批抽验，检验工作就增加了二倍。
    好消息来了，北京举办了一个匈牙利纺织仪器展览会，厂里参观的同志带回一本展品目录，他发现里面有一种偏振光显微镜原棉成熟度分析器，这是科学上的最新成就。于是他又想仿制这个仪器了。这是要牵涉到高深的光学理论的。但是他对这恰巧一窍不通怎么办呢。
    在一本纺织通报杂志上，他看到了匈牙利专家为偏振光显微镜作的专题报告，他到旧货摊上买了几本有关偏振光的理论书籍和镜片。为了克服不懂俄文的困难，又买了一本辞典，一个字一个字地翻译，参考了书上的图示，一连做了八十多次的试验，在去年11月底他获得了成功。
    今年3月份，纺织工业部技术司的同志来到安达一厂，对曹振华新创造的这架仪器评价极高，并鼓励他再作改进，达到更高的要求。
    厂的领导人员，也十分重视，帮助他到上海各个光学仪器厂去打听，并且指定一位钳工帮助他搞些零件什么的。
    通过上海综合仪器厂技术顾问——浙江大学教授赵元同志的帮助，曹振华只花二十多天就创造成功了显映式原棉成熟度分析器，成本很低，只要两个镜头，一片反光镜，共二十元左右。
    5月份，曹振华出席了全国先进生产者代表会议。上海市团委还选他为青年生产突击手。他第一次获得这样的荣誉，兴奋得流下了眼泪。
    曹振华就是这样用创造性的劳动把自己带进了科学研究的大门。在他即将去中国科学院上海研究所报到的前夜，我找到了他，我向他祝贺，紧紧地握住了他的手，问他：“你对这次调动工作有什么感想？”
    他沉默着，长时间不说话，我正在动脑筋该怎么启发他，他突然眼睛一睐，淘气似地对我说：“有人说我会滋长可怕的自满情绪，你想，我会自满吗？”他接着轻轻地叹了一口气：“我凭什么自满呢？上海专家多的是，我做一种东西要成年累月，人家不过想不到做吧了，要做起来还不简单！”
