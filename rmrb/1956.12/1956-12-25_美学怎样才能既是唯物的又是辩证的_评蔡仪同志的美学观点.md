How Can Aesthetics Be Both Materialistic and Dialectical
—A Critique of Comrade Cai Yi's Aesthetic Views
Zhu Guangqian

Comrade Huang Yaomian's article criticizing my aesthetic viewpoints – "On the Aesthetics of the Rentier Class" – was published after my own self-criticism. Before its publication, he had shown me the paper he presented at the science discussion at Beijing Normal University – which was the same one later published in the Wenyi Bao. I expressed, through Comrade Kang Tuo, editor of the Wenyi Bao, that I basically accepted his criticism and raised some suggestions. I pointed out that his views on issues like "empathy," "self-forgetfulness," and "inspiration" were not much different from my past views, that "association" played a very important role in his aesthetics, seemingly replacing "image intuition" with "image association," and that I felt he had not clearly explained issues such as "beauty in the mind or in the object," the relationship between beauty and aesthetic feeling, and the distinction and relationship between image thinking and abstract thinking. I hoped he could give me more help on these issues. However, Comrade Huang Yaomian completely ignored my suggestions and questions, publishing the paper he presented at Beijing Normal University almost verbatim in the Wenyi Bao. Therefore, some problems existing in Comrade Huang Yaomian's own aesthetic viewpoints were not resolved for me. At that time, I still thought his aesthetic viewpoint was basically materialistic, although some signs (as mentioned above) made me somewhat suspicious. This illustrates that my ability to distinguish between idealist aesthetics was still very poor.

Now, after reading Comrade Cai Yi's article "Critique of 'On the Aesthetics of the Rentier Class'," I feel that some of the problems I had with Comrade Huang Yaomian's aesthetic viewpoints have been resolved. Comrade Cai Yi, through very rigorous and meticulous analysis, pointed out the contradiction between Comrade Huang Yaomian's subjective intention to use materialistic principles to solve aesthetic problems and his basic subjective idealist arguments. I basically agree with Comrade Cai Yi's criticism of Comrade Huang Yaomian; as for his own aesthetic viewpoints expressed in the criticism, I feel there are still some issues that need further exploration. Because his own aesthetic viewpoints still have problems, his criticism of Huang Yaomian's emphasis on the subjective aspect is also somewhat excessive. This article is very enlightening, making me further realize the difficulty of aesthetics: drawing a line between idealism and materialism in aesthetics is not an easy task, and even if the line between idealism and materialism is indeed drawn, it does not mean that the aesthetic problem has been solved. For example, Comrade Cai Yi's aesthetic viewpoint undoubtedly attempts to take a materialistic direction, but I do not think his argument solves the basic problems of aesthetics. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly explain the difficulties I feel with his argument and offer a tentative solution to the difficulties, hoping to stimulate further constructive discussion.

Comrade Cai Yi's basic viewpoint can be seen from the entire article, especially from the following two paragraphs:

"I do not deny the psychological fact that people use objects to express their emotions, but since the characteristics of the object itself are denied, then the image of the object used to express emotions, from the perspective of the subject expressing emotions, is basically a phantom of their own sentiments, and from the perspective of the objective object, the image they see is basically not a true image of the object. As the saying goes, 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder,' this 'beauty' is not a true beauty. Therefore, a natural landscape is definitely not 'a state of mind.' Similarly, the image of plum blossoms is not a symbol of anyone's character. The 'image of the object' exists independently of the appraising person, and the beauty of the image of the object also exists independently of the appraising person..."

"Naturally, we also admit that the reason why people consider a certain object beautiful is related to their life experience, current state of mind, and their ideological inclinations, etc. But if the beauty of an object does not have its own reasons, and is only determined by human subjectivity, then the so-called 'aesthetic evaluation' has no objective standard, only subjective basis, then the evaluation of beauty can only vary according to human subjectivity, with no distinction between right and wrong, or correct and incorrect… In essence, it is a complete denial of beauty, it is aesthetic nihilism."

We can summarize Comrade Cai Yi's aesthetic viewpoints into three main points:

(1) Beauty and aesthetic feeling are opposed; beauty is an objective existence, lies in the laws of objective things themselves, is primary, aesthetic feeling is subjective cognition, is secondary; beauty can arouse aesthetic feeling, but aesthetic feeling cannot influence beauty, the beauty of the image of the object exists independently of the appraising person.

(2) Ideals of beauty, life experience, state of mind, ideological inclinations, etc. are all subjective, related to why people consider a certain object beautiful, that is to say, related to aesthetic feeling, not related to beauty. People can use the image of the object to express emotions, but this image is a phantom of their own sentiments (sentiments are produced by ideals of beauty, life experience, ideological inclinations, etc.), not a true image of the object. The image of the object exists independently of the appraising person.

(3) Acknowledging that the beauty of things has its own reasons is the only way aesthetic evaluation has an objective standard and a distinction between right and wrong.

It must be admitted that this view is closer to the truth than my past "pure subjective idealism" and Huang Yaomian's "impure subjective idealism" because it attempts to take the Marxist-Leninist theory of reflection as the basis of aesthetics, taking a materialistic path. But it must also be pointed out that this view is still very far from the truth, because Comrade Cai Yi only grasped the point that "existence determines consciousness" and did not sufficiently value "consciousness can also influence existence," did not sufficiently estimate the role of world view, class consciousness, etc. on aesthetic and artistic creation, did not sufficiently appreciate the truth that Marx implied when he listed "aesthetic" (translated as "artistic" in general translations) forms alongside law, politics, religion, etc. as forms of social consciousness in "Critique of Political Economy": aesthetic feeling and art are not only natural phenomena, but also have their social character, so their activity differs from the activity of natural science. Therefore, Comrade Cai Yi inevitably is sometimes one-sided, mechanical, and dogmatic in his attempt to apply Marxism-Leninism, though carefully adhering to the materialistic path, he is not dialectical.

Where exactly is the problem with Comrade Cai Yi's aesthetic viewpoint?

First, he did not recognize the object of aesthetic feeling, did not see the difference between "object" and "image of the object," did not recognize that the object of aesthetic feeling is the "image of the object" and not the "object" itself. The "image of the object" is the result of the "object" being reflected in human consciousness under the influence of given subjective conditions (such as ideology, sentiments, etc.), so it is only a form of knowledge. In this reflection relationship, the object is primary, and the image of the object is secondary. But this "image of the object" becomes the object of cognition in the process of formation, and as an object, it can also be called "object," but this "object" (referred to as object B for short) is different from the original "object" that produced the image (referred to as object A for short), object A is only a natural object, and object B is produced by the objective conditions of the natural object plus the influence of human subjective conditions, so it is no longer purely a natural object, but an object mixed with human subjective components, in other words, it is already a social object. The object of aesthetic feeling is not a natural object but a social object as the image of the object. Aesthetics studies only how this social object is produced, what properties and values it has, and what role it plays; as for natural objects (social phenomena can also be regarded as natural objects before they become artistic images), they are the object of science. According to this view, there is an essential difference between the form of aesthetic or artistic reflection and the form of general knowledge or scientific reflection, between grasping the world artistically and grasping the world scientifically, for example, between recognizing "the flower is beautiful" and recognizing "the flower is red": in the process of science reflecting the external world, subjective conditions play no role, or only a very small role, it is basically objective; in the process of aesthetic feeling reflecting the external world, subjective conditions play a large or even decisive role, it is a unity of the subjective and the objective, a unity of naturalness and sociality. For example, differences in era, ethnicity, social formation, class, and cultural cultivation can hardly affect a person's recognition that "the flower is red," but can greatly affect a person's recognition that "the flower is beautiful." There is a Latin saying that "there is no arguing about taste" (referring to aesthetic ability), the individual differences in aesthetic aspects must be admitted, the reason for the differences is that it is mixed with various subjective components, unlike natural objects which are simply objective.

Comrade Cai Yi's basic problem lies in not sufficiently valuing the distinction mentioned here, confusing the natural "object" with the "image of the object" after aesthetic reflection, and deducing a wrong conclusion that "the image of the object does not depend on the appraising person" from the correct principle that "the object does not depend on the knowing person to exist." Therefore, he sees no difference between artistically grasping the world and scientifically grasping the world, between recognizing "the flower is beautiful" and recognizing "the flower is red." Beauty is merely an attribute of the natural object, just as red is an attribute of the flower, completely objective, and has nothing to do with subjective components. In this way, he deprives beauty of its subjectivity, and also deprives beauty of its sociality. (Note: Comrade Cai Yi used to think that the "attribute of the object" of "beauty" was the "normality" of things, but later he seemed to abandon the "normality" theory, and did not talk much about the "attribute of the object." But judging from this article, his basic proposition has not changed. Since beauty is only in the object, it cannot be the essence of the object, it can only be the attribute of the object.)

If Huang Yaomian's problem is, as Cai Yi said, that "in words, he says that the beauty of art mainly lies in its ability to truly reflect the essence and laws of objective things, but in theory, he essentially believes that the image of art is fundamentally the expression of subjective thoughts, feelings, and ideals," then Comrade Cai Yi's own problem is exactly the opposite, in words, he admits the role of subjective components such as thoughts, feelings, world view, class consciousness, etc. on aesthetic feeling, but in theory, he essentially cancels out these subjective components. When talking about the role of these subjective components, he says, "naturally we also admit," then "I do not deny," then "this is no problem," and the talk stops there, showing that he does not value these subjective components, and judging from the essence of his theory, he cannot value them. Since he believes that "the image of the object does not depend on the appraising person to exist, and the beauty of the image of the object also does not depend on the appraising person to exist," and the subjective components such as thoughts, feelings, world view, class consciousness, etc. are precisely the affairs of the "appraising person," the natural conclusion is that "the image of the object" and "the beauty of the image of the object" also do not depend on things such as thoughts, feelings, world view, class consciousness, etc. In other words, beauty is purely an objective existence, and aesthetics can solve the problem of beauty purely based on objective phenomena, just like natural science solves the problem of the attributes and laws of objects, without needing to bring in subjective things such as thoughts, feelings, world view, class consciousness, etc. Not only that, according to Comrade Cai Yi, the image that people see in the external world under the influence of these subjective conditions "is a phantom of their own sentiments," "basically not a true image of the object." Here, I think that "sentiments" can be said to be produced by life experience and ideological inclinations (world view, class consciousness). Then, according to Comrade Cai Yi's logical reasoning, in order to eliminate "phantoms," in order to see the "true image of the object," it is necessary to abandon things like life experience and ideological inclinations (world view, class consciousness) altogether, because according to the world view and class consciousness, etc., the image of the object seen is all "phantoms," not "true images of the object." This would not only overthrow the principle that "literature and art reflect class consciousness," but also overthrow the basic principle of realism that "literature and art reflect reality." From this, it can be seen that Cai Yi, due to the one-sided, mechanical, and dogmatic application of Marxism-Leninism, will end up going to the road of anti-Marxism-Leninism.

Now we can further analyze Comrade Cai Yi's view of beauty. What exactly is beauty? Comrade Cai Yi answers: it is "existing independently of the appraising person." According to Marx, the appraising "person" is "the sum total of social relations," so Comrade Cai Yi's meaning is equivalent to saying that beauty exists independently of social relations, beauty can transcend the era, ethnicity, social formation, class, cultural cultivation, etc. To put it more specifically, a beautiful thing can produce countless evaluations or aesthetic feelings of different nature and degree for countless people of different eras, ethnicities, social formations, classes, and cultural cultivation. According to Comrade Cai Yi's theory, aesthetic feeling cannot influence beauty, aesthetic feeling is ever-changing, but beauty is unchanging, and always objectively exists. This is tantamount to saying that these countless different people have not seen the whole of beauty, at most each person can only see a trace of it, what is the essence of this theory? In terms of regarding beauty as an objective existence that cannot be fully recognized by people, it applies Kant's unknowability to aesthetics; in terms of regarding beauty as an absolute concept that is detached from the aesthetic feelings of countless people and stands independently, it is fundamentally Plato's objective idealism. From this, it can be seen that Comrade Cai Yi, due to the one-sided, mechanical, and dogmatic application of Marxism-Leninism, will end up going to the road of idealism.

The key issue lies in the relationship between beauty and aesthetic feeling. Beauty causes aesthetic feeling, this fact is probably not denied by anyone. Can aesthetic feeling influence beauty? Comrade Cai Yi's answer is no. I know this is a dangerous zone, and if not handled well, one will fall into the quagmire of idealism. Whenever the relationship between the subjective and the objective is discussed, people always turn up their noses at the subjective things, probably also harboring this kind of caution. But the existence of subjective effect is still an objective fact. I always feel that the saying that aesthetic feeling cannot influence beauty is somewhat incomplete. First, aesthetic feeling changes in thousands of ways under the influence of the era, ethnicity, social formation, class, and cultural cultivation, but beauty is unchanging, and not affected by these factors. As analyzed in the above paragraph, this view will lead to subjective idealism and unknowability. Secondly, since the object of aesthetic feeling is the image of the object, and the image of the object, as analyzed above, is a unity of the subjective and the objective, determined on the one hand by the objective conditions of the object, and also affected on the other hand by human subjective conditions, but now it is said that the beauty of this image of the object is purely objective, without any subjective components, as if the son is born of both parents, only allowing the inheritance of one aspect of the father or mother's personality. Thirdly, Marxism teaches us that existence determines consciousness, but consciousness can also influence existence, but now it is said that in the aesthetic realm, only existence determines consciousness, and consciousness does not influence existence, this is also somewhat strange. In short, this is a difficult problem, but also an extremely important problem, solving this problem should be one of the directions of the effort to establish a new aesthetics in the future, now is not the time to draw a final conclusion. My current idea is inclined to admit that aesthetic feeling can influence beauty. How does aesthetic feeling influence beauty? Here we must return to the distinction between "object" (object A) and "image of the object" (object B) analyzed above. Object A exists naturally, purely objectively, and it has certain conditions that can produce a beautiful image (object B). The reason why this object B is produced is not only due to the objective conditions of object A, but also due to the influence of human subjective conditions, so it is a unity of the subjective and the objective. Human subjective consciousness cannot influence the objective existence of object A, just as the consciousness of recognizing red cannot influence the existence of red. This is unshakable. Comrade Cai Yi's theoretical basis lies here. But we have already analyzed that the object of aesthetic feeling is not this object A but object B. So the current problem is not whether aesthetic feeling can influence object A but whether it can influence object B. Object B was originally half made up of subjective conditions, so the so-called aesthetic feeling can influence object B is precisely saying that subjective conditions can influence object B. The same object A can produce different forms of object B under the subjective conditions of different people, which shows that the aesthetic ability of different people can influence the formation of object B, can make some of the objective conditions of object A play a role, some not play a role, some play 80% of the role, and some only play 20% of the role. Beauty is the evaluation of object B, and can also be said to be the attribute of object B. Aesthetic feeling can influence the formation of object B, it is in this sense that we say aesthetic feeling can influence beauty. The reason why I think so is due to the inspiration I got from Marx's sentence in "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts" when discussing the development of aesthetic feeling. This sentence is: "The most beautiful music has no meaning for the ear that cannot appreciate music, it is not an object." I think that Marx's meaning here of "not an object" is not to cancel the existence of the most beautiful music (object A), but only to say that this most beautiful music (object A) cannot produce a beautiful image (object B) for the ear that cannot appreciate music (the difference in subjective conditions). That is to say, due to the insufficient subjective conditions (aesthetic ability) of the ear that cannot appreciate music, the objective conditions that can produce a beautiful image from the most beautiful music cannot play a role, so a beautiful image (object B) cannot be produced. In addition, I also realized from Marx's words the relationship between the development of aesthetic feeling and the development of beauty. Aesthetic feeling is a social phenomenon, it must develop with social development, in the process of aesthetic ability becoming increasingly refined, the beauty of things not only in scope but also in degree becomes increasingly rich and elevated. The history of any art can prove this point. Taking music as an example, from the primitive people's knocking on sticks and hitting pots to the modern symphony, the beauty of music is gradually developing. The development of this musical beauty is due on the one hand to the development of material conditions and techniques, and on the other hand also due to the gradual development of the musical ear (i.e., aesthetic ability), gradually putting forward higher demands on music, and at the same time gradually creating higher images based on the improved objective conditions. That is to say, in the historical process, aesthetic feeling can influence beauty.

The reason why I mentioned the issue of the development of aesthetic feeling and beauty is not only to explain that aesthetic feeling can influence beauty, but also to use this as a basis to further discuss the issue of objective standards of beauty raised by Comrade Cai Yi. According to Comrade Cai Yi's theory, acknowledging that the beauty of things has its own reasons is the only way aesthetic evaluation has an objective standard and a distinction between right and wrong. I have a few opinions on this view. First, his so-called "beauty," as analyzed above, is an absolute concept, not one that anyone can fully reach by virtue of aesthetic feeling, that is to say, it is an unknown number, and an unknown number cannot be used as a measure to measure things. Secondly, if this purely objective beauty can be analyzed into several objective laws of beauty, then Comrade Cai Yi should remember that since ancient Greece, people have been seeking this objective law of beauty, the most significant attempt being the modern so-called "experimental aesthetics" (such as the experiment on "golden section") and the so-called "aesthetic measurement" currently popular in the United States. This attempt is doomed to failure, because it ignores that aesthetic feeling is a social phenomenon mixed with many subjective components, and "experimenting" and "measuring" purely from the objective aspect cannot obtain satisfactory results. In terms of method, it is metaphysical, not comprehensive. Even if this kind of "experiment" and "measurement" can obtain some fragmented and one-sided objective laws, if you think that you can use these laws to appreciate beauty or create art, then you can only be said to be formalism. This is not to deny the objective laws of beauty, but to say that this objective law cannot be found solely from the attributes of things, but also to take into account the role of the human subjective aspect. Thirdly, the last and most important point, Comrade Cai Yi not only regards beauty as an absolute concept, but also regards aesthetic standards as absolute standards. According to his theory, beauty exists independently of the "appraising person," independently of the era, ethnicity, social formation, class, and cultural cultivation, so it is not only purely objective, but also absolute. This view has two implications. First, beauty does not change, only aesthetic feeling changes. Second, the objective law of "beauty" is used as an absolute standard to measure the ever-changing aesthetic feelings, to see whether they conform to this objective law and to determine their "right and wrong" and "correct and incorrect." This standard should be applicable to primitive people, modern people, Chinese people, Greeks, exploiting classes and exploited classes, etc. It should be pointed out that this view violates the principle of development mentioned above. The problem is not that Comrade Cai Yi admits that aesthetic feeling can develop, but that he denies that beauty can develop with the development of aesthetic feeling. With this denial, beauty becomes the finish line of a long-distance race in history, primitive people ran for a while and stopped, they were still very far from beauty, with social development, people ran closer and closer to beauty, and perhaps one day, people's aesthetic feeling will develop to the peak, and then reach this beauty finish line. The view of development does not allow for such a beauty finish line, the view of development requires not only aesthetic feeling to progress, but also beauty to progress, with endless progress; therefore, the view of development does not allow beauty to have an eternally unchanging, universally applicable standard. Of course, we must admit the basic principle of realism: art must reflect reality. But the "reality" mentioned here should include both the objective situation of natural objects and the subjective situation of the aesthetic person. Both of these situations develop with social development. So the reality content of the basic principle that "art reflects reality" also develops with social development, saying that a work of art is faithful to reality can only mean that it is faithful to the reality under certain historical conditions. We cannot use the understanding of the reality of the socialist era to measure whether the artists of the slave society era were faithful to the reality of this socialist era, and to determine whether their works are beautiful or not. Doing so is anti-historicism. People in different historical conditions often have different requirements for beauty, and have different standards, what one thinks is beautiful, the other may think is not beautiful. If the people in a certain historical condition find that something has reached their beauty requirements and meets their beauty standards, they say that this thing is beautiful, I think this is natural, they should have this right. If according to Comrade Cai Yi's theory, saying that their aesthetic feeling has not reached the absolute standard of beauty, beauty will become the sun pursued by Kua Fu in mythology. From the point of view of development, not only aesthetic feeling is developing, beauty is developing, and the standard of beauty is also developing. The development of these three is mutually related. Comrade Cai Yi's aesthetics is anti-development viewpoint.

My opinions on Comrade Cai Yi are roughly like this. Some issues need to be discussed separately in special topics, and can only be briefly touched upon here. I have not read his recent works specifically stating his aesthetic viewpoints, and only make inferences based on the aesthetic viewpoints expressed in his article criticizing Comrade Huang Yaomian this time, there may be misunderstandings about Comrade Cai Yi. I sincerely hope that he can write a more detailed work on the results of his hard work over the years as soon as possible. The positive significance of this article is not in the criticism of Comrade Cai Yi, but in the preliminary attempt to establish a new aesthetic viewpoint after criticizing my own past idealist aesthetic thought. I humbly await criticism and discussion.

    美学怎样才能既是唯物的又是辩证的
    ——评蔡仪同志的美学观点
    朱光潜
    黄药眠同志批判我的美学观点的文章——“论食利者的美学”——是在我自己批判的文章之后发表的。在发表之前，他曾经把在北京师范大学科学讨论会上所提出的论文——也就是后来在文艺报发表的那篇——给我看过。我通过文艺报编辑康濯同志表示我基本上接受他的批评，并且提出了一些意见。我指出他对于“移情”，“忘我”，“灵感”等问题的看法和我过去的看法没有多大分别，指出在他的美学里“联想”占了很重要的地位，似乎用“形象的联想”代替了“形象的直觉”，并且表示我觉得他对于“美在心或在物”，美与美感的关系以及形象思惟与抽象思惟的分别和关系等问题没有说得很清楚，希望他进一步在这些问题上多给我一些帮助。但是黄药眠同志对于我提的意见和问题根本没有理睬，把在北京师范大学提出的论文几乎原封不动地发表在文艺报。因此，我对于黄药眠同志自己的美学观点所存在的一些问题没有得到解决。当时我还觉得他的美学观点基本上是唯物的，尽管有些迹象（如上文所提的）使我有些怀疑。这就说明了我对于唯心主义美学的判别力还是很差的。
    现在读到蔡仪同志的“评‘论食利者的美学’”一篇文章，我觉得我过去对黄药眠同志的美学观点的问题得到了一些解决。蔡仪同志用很谨严周密的分析，指出了黄药眠同志要用唯物主义的原则来解决美学问题的主观意图和他的主观唯心主义的基本论点之间是有矛盾的。就蔡仪同志对于黄药眠同志的批评来说，我基本上是同意的；就蔡仪同志在批评之中所表现出的他自己的美学观点来说，我觉得还有些问题尚待进一步的探讨。由于他自己的美学观点还有问题，他对于黄药眠强调主观作用的一方面的批评也有些过偏。他这篇文章是很富于启发性的，使我进一步认识到美学的困难：在美学上划清唯心与唯物的界限已经不是一件容易事，即使唯心与唯物的界限果然划清了，也还不等于说就已解决了美学问题。比如说，蔡仪同志的美学观点无疑地是企图走唯物方向的，但是我不认为他的说法解决了美学的基本问题。我想趁这个机会很简单扼要地说明我对于他的说法所感到的困难，趁便也提出我的一点试探性的解决困难的办法，希望可以引起进一步的建设性的讨论。
    蔡仪同志的基本观点可以从全文，特别是从下列两段话里看出：
    “我并不否认人有借物抒情的心理及事实，但是既然否认物本身的特点，那么被人用以抒情的物的形象，从抒情的主体来说，他所见的形象基本是自己的情趣的幻影，从客观的物来说，他所见的形象基本上不是真正的物的形象。所谓‘情人眼里出西施’，这‘西施’就并不是真正的西施。所以一片自然风景决不是‘一种心境’。同样，梅花的形象也不是什么人的性格的象征。‘物的形象’是不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在的，物的形象的美也是不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在的……”
    “自然我们也承认人之所以认为某一对象的美，是和他的生活经验，当时的心境及他的思想倾向等有关系。但是对象的美如果没有它本身的原因，只是决定于人的主观，所谓‘美学评价’，也没有客观的标准，只有主观的根据，那么美的评价也就只能因人的主观而异，既无是非之分，也无正误之别。……实质上也就是美的完全否定，是美学上的虚无主义。”
    我们可以把蔡仪同志的美学观点归纳成为三个要点：
    （一）美与美感是对立的；美是客观存在，在于客观事物本身的法则，是第一性的，美感是主观认识，是第二性的；美可以引起美感，但是美感不能影响美，物的形象的美是不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在的。
    （二）美的理想，生活经验，心境，思想倾向等等都是主观的，对于人之所以认为某一对象的美有关系，这就是说，与美感有关，与美无关。人可以借物的形象来抒情，但是这种形象是人自己情趣（按情趣是由美的理想生活经验，思想倾向等等产生的）的幻影，不是真正的物的形象。物的形象是不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在的。
    （三）承认事物的美有它本身的原因，美的评价才有客观的标准，才有是非之分。
    必须承认，这个看法比我过去的“纯粹的主观唯心论”和黄药眠的“不纯粹的主观唯心论”都较接近于真理，因为它企图把马克思列宁主义的反映论作为美学的基础，走唯物的路向。但是也必须指出，这个看法离真理究竟还很远，因为蔡仪同志只抓住了“存在决定意识”一点，没有足够地重视“意识也可以影响存在”，没有足够地估计世界观，阶级意识等等对于审美与艺术创造的作用，没有足够地体会马克思在“政治经济学批判”里把“美感的”（在一般译本中作“艺术的”）形式和法律，政治，宗教等并列为社会意识形态时所暗示的一个真理：美感和艺术不仅是自然现象，而有它的社会性，所以它的活动不同于自然科学的活动。因此，蔡仪同志在企图运用马克思列宁主义的过程中有时不免是片面的，机械的，教条的，虽然是谨守唯物的路向，却不是辩证的。
    蔡仪同志的美学观点的毛病究竟在哪里呢？
    首先他没有认清美感的对象，没有在“物”与“物的形象”之中见出分别，没有认出美感的对象是“物的形象”而不是“物”本身。“物的形象”是“物”在人的既定的主观条件（如意识形态，情趣等）的影响下反映于人的意识的结果，所以只是一种知识形式。在这个反映的关系上，物是第一性的，物的形象是第二性的。但是这“物的形象”在形成之中就成了认识的对象，就其为对象来说，它也可以叫做“物”，不过这个“物”（姑简称物乙）不同于原来产生形象的那个“物”（姑简称物甲），物甲只是自然物，物乙是自然物的客观条件加上人的主观条件的影响而产生的，所以已经不纯是自然物，而是夹杂着人的主观成分的物，换句话说，已经是社会的物了。美感的对象不是自然物而是作为物的形象的社会的物。美学所研究的也只是这个社会的物如何产生，具有什么性质和价值，发生什么作用；至于自然物（社会现象在未成为艺术形象时，也可以看作自然物）则是科学的对象。依据这个看法，美感的或艺术的反映形式与一般知识或科学的反映形式，艺术地掌握世界与科学地掌握世界，举例来说，认识“花是美的”与认识“花是红的”，这中间有一个本质的分别：科学在反映外物界的过程中，主观条件不起什么作用，或是只起很小的作用，它基本上是客观的；美感在反映外物界的过程中，主观条件却起很大的甚至是决定性的作用，它是主观与客观的统一，自然性与社会性的统一。举例来说，时代，民族，社会形态，阶级，以及文化修养的差别不大能影响一个人对于“花是红的”认识，却很能影响一个人对于“花是美的”认识。拉丁文有句成语说，“谈到趣味（指的是审美力）无争辩”，在审美方面的个别差异是必须承认的，其所以有差异，就因为它里面夹杂有种种主观的成分，不像自然物那么单纯是客观的。
    蔡仪同志的基本毛病就在没有足够地重视这里所说的分别，把自然“物”和经过美感反映之后的“物的形象”混为一事，从“物不依赖于认识的人而存在”一个正确的原则推演到“物的形象不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在”一个错误的结论。因此，他把艺术地掌握世界与科学地掌握世界，把认识“花是美的”与认识“花是红的”，看成毫无分别。美只是自然物的一个属性，犹如红是花的一个属性一样，完全是客观的，与主观成分毫无关系。这样一来，他剥夺了美的主观性，也就剥夺了美的社会性。（注：蔡仪同志过去认为“美”这个“物的属性”就是事物的“常态”，后来他似乎放弃了“常态”说，也不大谈“物的属性”了。但是从他这篇文章看来，他的基本主张并没有变更。美既只在物，它不能是物的本体，就只能是物的属性。）
    假如黄药眠的毛病是如蔡仪所说的，“文字上说艺术的美主要的是在于它能够真实地反映出客观事物的本质和规律，理论实质上认为艺术的形象根本是主观的思想，感情，理想的表现”，蔡仪同志自己的毛病就恰好翻了一个跟头，文字上承认思想，感情，世界观，阶级意识等主观成分对于美感的作用，理论实质却把这些主观成分一笔勾销了。谈到这些主观成分的作用时，他一则说“自然我们也承认”，再则说“我并不否认”，三则说“这是毫无问题的”，话就到此为止，没有作进一步的分析，足见他对这些主观成分并不重视，而从他的理论实质看来，他也不能重视这些。他既然认为“物的形象是不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在的，物的形象的美也是不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在的”，而思想，感情，世界观，阶级意识等等主观成分正是“鉴赏的人”那方面的事，当然的结论就是“物的形象”和“物的形象的美”也就都不依赖于什么思想，感情，世界观，阶级意识等等主观的东西了。换句话说，美纯粹是客观存在，美学对于美的问题也就可以像自然科学对于物的属性和规律的问题一样，纯粹地根据客观现象来解决，用不着把思想，感情，世界观，阶级意识那一类主观的东西拉进来。还不仅此，人在这些主观的条件影响之下在外物界所见到的形象，依蔡仪同志说，“是自己情趣的幻影”，“基本上不是真正的物的形象”。这里所谓“情趣”我想可以说就是生活经验和思想倾向（世界观，阶级意识）所产生的。那么，依蔡仪同志的逻辑推论下去，为着免除“幻影”，为着看到“真正的物的形象”，就须把生活经验和思想倾向（世界观，阶级意识）之类东西一齐抛开，因为依据世界观和阶级意识等等所见到的物的形象一律是“幻影”，不是“真正的物的形象”。这就不但要推翻“文艺反映阶级意识”的原则，也就要推翻“文艺反映现实”的现实主义的基本原则了。从此可见，蔡仪由于片面地，机械地，教条地运用马克思列宁主义，而结果是要走到反马克思列宁主义的道路上去的。
    现在我们可以进一步分析蔡仪同志对于美的看法。美究竟是什么？蔡仪同志回答说：它是“不依赖于鉴赏的人而存在的”。这鉴赏的“人”，据马克思说，就是“社会关系的总和”，所以蔡仪这句话的意思就等于说，美不依赖于社会关系而存在，美是可以超时代，民族，社会形态，阶级，文化修养等等而存在的。说得更具体一点，一件美的事物对于时代，民族，社会形态，阶级，文化修养不同的无数人可能产生无数不同性质和程度的美的评价或美感，据蔡仪同志的理论推下去，美感不能影响美，美感尽管是千变万化的，而美却是一成不变的，永远是客观存在的。这就无异于说，这无数不同的人都没有见到那美的全体，至多每人只能见到它的一丝一毫，这种理论实质上是什么呢？就其把美这个客观存在看作不是人所能完全认识的对象来说，它是把康德式的不可知论应用到美学里面来；就其把美看作是脱离无数人的美感而超然独立的一种绝对概念来说，它基本上就是柏腊图式的客观唯心论。从此可见，蔡仪同志由于片面地，机械地，教条地运用马克思列宁主义，而结果是要走到唯心主义的道路上去的。
    问题的关键在于美与美感的关系。美是引起美感的，这个事实大概没有人会否认。美感能否影响美呢？蔡仪同志的答案是否定的。我知道这是个危险地带，弄得不好就会落到唯心主义的泥淖里去。一谈到主观与客观的关系时，人们对于主观的东西总是掩鼻而过之，大概也是存着这种戒心。但是主观作用的存在也还是一个客观的事实。我总觉得美感不能影响美的说法有些不圆满。第一，美感受时代，民族，社会形态，阶级，文化修养的影响而千变万化，美却一成不变，不受这些因素的影响。这种看法如上段所分析的，会导致主观唯心论与不可知论。其次，美感的对象既是物的形象，而物的形象如上文所分析的，是主观与客观的统一，一方面由物的客观条件决定，一方面也受人的主观条件的影响，现在却说这物的形象的美纯粹是客观的，丝毫没有主观的成分，好像儿子是父母两人生的，只许遗传下父或母一方面的性格。第三，马克思主义教导我们说，存在决定意识，而意识也可以影响存在，现在却说在美感范围内，只有存在决定意识，没有意识影响存在，这也像有些奇怪。总之，这是个难问题，却也是个极端重要的问题，解决这个问题应该是今后建立新美学的努力方向之一，现在还不是下最后结论的时候。我现在的想法是倾向于承认美感能影响美的。美感怎样影响美呢？这里我们须回到上文所分析的“物”（物甲）与“物的形象”（物乙）的分别。物甲是自然存在的，纯粹客观的，它具有某些条件可以产生美的形象（物乙）。这物乙之所以产生，却不单靠物甲的客观条件，还须加上人的主观条件的影响，所以是主观与客观的统一。人的主观意识不能影响物甲的客观存在，犹如认识到红色的意识不能影响红色的存在。这是确凿不可移的。蔡仪同志的理论根据就在此。但是我们已经分析过，美感的对象并不是这个物甲而是物乙。所以目前的问题不是美感能否影响物甲而是它能否影响物乙。物乙本来有一半是由主观条件造成的，所谓美感能影响物乙，正是说主观条件可以影响物乙。同一物甲在不同的人的主观条件之下可以产生不同形式的物乙，这就说明了不同的人的美感能力可以影响到物乙的形成，可以使物甲的客观条件之中某些起作用，某些不起作用，某些起80％的作用，某些只起20％的作用。美是对于物乙的评价，也可以说就是物乙的属性。美感能影响物乙的形成，就是在这个意义上，我们说美感能影响美。我之所以作如此想法，是由于体会马克思在“经济学—哲学手稿”里论美感的发展时所说的一句话而得到的启发。这句话是：“最美的音乐对于不能欣赏音乐的耳就没有意义，就不是对象。”我想马克思这里所说的“不是对象”并不是要取消最美的音乐（物甲）的存在，而只是说这最美的音乐（物甲）对于不能欣赏音乐的耳（主观条件的差异）不能产生美的形象（物乙）。也就是说，由于不能欣赏音乐的耳的主观条件（美感能力）不够，最美的音乐之所以能产生美的形象的客观条件不能发生作用，就不能产生美的形象（物乙），此外，我从马克思的这段话里还体会到美感发展与美的发展的关系。美感是一种社会的现象，它是要随着社会发展而发展的，在美感力日渐精锐化的过程中，事物的美不但在范围上而且在程度上都日渐丰富和提高起来。任何一门艺术的历史都可以证明这个道理。姑拿音乐为例，从原始人的敲棒击缶到现代的交响乐，音乐的美是日渐在发展着。这音乐美的发展一方面固然由于物质条件和技巧的发展，一方面也由于音乐的耳（即审美力）日渐在发展，对于音乐日渐提出更高的要求，同时也日渐依据改进了的客观条件，创造出更高的形象。这就是说，在历史过程中，美感能影响美。
    我之所以提到美感与美的发展问题，不仅要说明美感能影响美，还要以此为据，进一步讨论蔡仪同志所提出的美的客观标准问题。依蔡仪同志的理论，承认事物的美有它的本身原因，美的评价才有客观的标准，才有是非之分。我对于这个看法有几点意见。第一，他之所谓“美”，如上文所分析，是一个绝对概念，不是任何人凭借美感所能完全达到的，这就是说，它是一个未知数，未知数是不能作为尺度来衡量事物的。其次，如果这个纯粹是客观的美是可以分析为若干美的客观法则的，那么，蔡仪同志应该记得，从古希腊以来，人们就一直在寻求这种美的客观法则，最显著的尝试是近代所谓“实验美学”（例如对“黄金段”的试验）以及现在在美国流行的所谓“美感测量”。这种尝试是注定要失败的，因为它忽视了美感是夹杂许多主观成分的社会现象，单从客观方面作“实验”，“测量”是不能得到圆满结果的。在方法上它是形而上学的，不是统观全面的。纵使这种“实验”和“测量”能得到一些零碎的片面的客观法则，如果以为凭这些法则就可以审美或是创造艺术，那就只能说是形式主义。这番话并非否定美的客观法则，只是说，这种客观法则不是单从物的属性上可以找到的，同时也要顾到人的主观方面的作用。第三，最后的也是最重要的一点，蔡仪同志不但把美看成一种绝对概念，而且也把审美的标准看作一种绝对标准。依他的理论，美是超于“欣赏的人”，超于时代，民族，社会形态，阶级以及文化修养而独立存在的，所以它不但是纯粹客观的，而且也是绝对的。这个看法有两个涵义。第一，美不变，只是美感在变。第二，把这“美”的客观法则作为绝对标准来衡量千变万化的美感，看它们是否符合这客观法则而判定其“是非”与“正误”。这个标准应该适用于原始人，现代人，中国人，希腊人，剥削阶级和被剥削阶级等等。应该指出，这种看法是违反上文所提到的发展原则的。问题不在蔡仪同志承认美感可发展，而在他否认美可随美感发展而发展。有此否认，美就成为历史上长途赛跑的终点指标，原始人跑了一段就停下来了，他们距离美还非常远，随着社会发展，人们跑得愈近于美，也许终久有一天，人们美感发展到了顶点了，于是就达到这美的终点指标。发展的观点就不容许有这么一个美的终点指标，发展的观点要求不但美感有进展，而且美也有进展，有无穷的进展；因此，发展的观点就不容许美有一个亘古常存，有放皆准的标准。当然，我们要承认现实主义的基本原则：艺术须反映现实。不过这里所说的“现实”应该包括自然物的客观情况与审美人的主观情况两方面。这两种情况都随着社会发展而发展着。所以“艺术反映现实”这个基本原则的现实内容也是随着社会发展而发展的，说一部艺术作品忠于现实，也只能是指忠于一定历史条件下的现实。我们不能根据对于社会主义时代现实的认识，去衡量奴隶社会时代艺术家们是否忠于这个社会主义时代的现实，而判定他们的作品美与不美。这样做，就是反历史主义。不同历史条件下的人民对于美往往有不同的要求，有不同的标准，此以为美的彼或以为不美。如果某一历史条件下的人民发见一件事物达到了他们的美的要求，符合了他们的美的标准，他们就说这事物美，我想这是理所当然的，他们应该有这种权利。如果依蔡仪同志的理论，说他们的美感还没有达到美的绝对标准，美就要成为神话中夸父所追的太阳了。依发展的观点看，不但美感是发展的，美是发展的，美的标准也是发展的。这三者的发展是互相联带的。蔡仪同志的美学却是反发展观点的。
    我对蔡仪同志的意见大致如此。有些问题还要另作专题讨论，这里只能约略涉及。我没有读到他的专门陈述自己美学观点的近著，只凭他这次批评黄药眠同志的文章所表现的美学观点作推论，可能对于蔡仪同志有误解的地方。我极希望他能早日把他这些年来辛勤研究的结果写出较详明的著作来。我这篇文章的积极意义还不在对蔡仪同志的批评，而在批判了自己过去唯心美学思想之后，对于建立新的美学观点所作的初步尝试。我虚心地静待批评和讨论。
