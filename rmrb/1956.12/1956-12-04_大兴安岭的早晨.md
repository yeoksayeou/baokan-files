Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, December 2nd: The morning in the Greater Khingan Mountains is captivating. Towering trees are covered in frost flowers, and the snow-capped peaks reflect a blue light. The sun climbs up from the east of the mountains, shining golden rays through the dense forest. At the campsite of a geological exploration team in this forest, people have already woken up. The first shift of drillers begins to excavate exploration trenches on the permafrost layer; after breakfast, the workers at the exploration pits emerge from their tents and walk along the snow-covered mountain road towards the machine platforms and construction sites deep in the dense forest. A group of young geologists, armed with hand hammers and carrying instruments and charts, also set off. Among them, several girls from Sichuan are particularly active. Wearing large fur hats and felt boots, they enter the dense forest, jumping up and down in the exploration trenches and pits all day long, observing the ore deposits. Geological engineer Cao Yichun got up early to continue working on the geological design for next year. Team leader Li Hongnian is sitting in his small wooden house, considering how to solve some of the problems encountered in the first winter construction and the issue of winter material transportation.

　　This exploration team, composed of more than six hundred people, entered this primitive forest, uninhabited for hundreds of miles, in June 1955. They focused on exploration while also conducting prospecting within a range of nearly three hundred square kilometers. After exploration and prospecting, they discovered a medium-sized metal mine. By the end of November, this team had already overfulfilled the state's assigned reserve task for this year.

　  ·大兴安岭的早晨·
    据新华社海拉尔2日电　大兴安岭的早晨是动人的。参天的树木挂满霜花，高山的雪顶反射着青光。太阳从岭东爬上来，照射得密林中金光缕缕。在这片森林中的一支地质勘探队的营地上，人们早就醒来了。第一班的钻机手，开始在常年冻土层上挖掘探槽；探坑的工人吃完早饭，钻出帐篷，顺着雪铺的盘山道，向密林深处的机台和工地走去。一群年轻的地质工作者拿上手锤，背上仪器图表，也出发了。其中从四川来的几个女孩子非常活跃，她们戴着大皮帽子，穿着毡疙疸，走进密林，成天在探槽、探坑里跳上跳下地观察着矿床。地质工程师曹义纯很早就爬起来继续赶作明年的地质设计。队长李鸿年坐在他的狭小的木屋里，正在考虑解决首次冬季施工中遇到的一些问题和冬季物资运输问题。
    这支由六百多人组成的勘探队，在1955年6月进入这片几百里内渺无人烟的原始森林。他们一面重点进行勘探，一面在近三百平方公里范围内普查找矿。经过勘探和普查，发现了一个中等规模的金属矿。到11月底，这个队已经超额完成了今年国家交给的储量任务。
