Reader's Letter:

    More Than Just a Lack of Care

    To the Editor:

    The Hunan Opera House in Changsha and the Changsha Railway Station, among other units, mechanically implement the queuing system for purchasing tickets, which is very inconvenient for disabled veterans. For example, on November 6th of this year, a disabled veteran with lower limb paralysis went to the Hunan Opera House to buy a ticket. He presented a letter of introduction and requested to bypass the queue. However, the staff member of the opera house coldly said, "If all disabled veterans require special consideration, then we don't need to sell tickets at all." Later, the two parties started arguing, and only after arguing with the manager of the opera house was the disabled veteran allowed to purchase a ticket with priority. Another example is that on July 22nd of this year, a disabled veteran missing one leg, using crutches for support, went to the East Station of the Changsha Railway Station to buy a ticket. Although he presented a letter of introduction, the ticket seller neither looked at it nor paid attention to him. Helpless, he had to queue, and it took him over an hour to finally buy a ticket. Similar instances of not caring for disabled veterans have also occurred in other cinemas and theaters in Changsha. I believe that their treatment of revolutionary disabled veterans is not only a lack of due care but also a loss of class friendship and sympathy. I hope the relevant departments in Changsha will find a way to improve this undesirable situation.

### 岂只是缺乏照顾

    岂只是缺乏照顾编辑同志：
    长沙市湖南戏院和长沙市火车站等单位，机械地执行购票排队的制度，对残废军人很不方便。如今年11月6日，有一位下肢瘫痪的残废军人到湖南戏院购票，他拿着介绍信请求不排队，但是，该院的工作人员却冷冷地说：“如果残废军人都要照顾，那我们就不用卖票了”。后来双方争吵起来，直到把该院的经理吵出来后，才允许这个残废军人优先买了票。又如今年7月22日，一位失去一只腿的残废军人手扶双拐到长沙市火车站东站购票，他虽然拿着介绍信，但是，售票员不看也不理。无奈，他只好排队，直等了一个多钟头才把票买到手里。类似这种不照顾残废军人的事情，在长沙其他影院戏院也发生过。我认为他们这样对待革命残废军人，不仅是缺乏应有的照顾，而且丧失了阶级友爱和同情。希望长沙市有关部门设法改善这种不良情况。
