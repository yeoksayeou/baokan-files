　　The Origin of a "Good Experience"
　　Hu Huanming Chen Bingyan

　　A "good experience" that was being introduced everywhere by the Rural Work Department of the Shangrao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party turned out to be something fabricated by a few cadres based solely on their subjective intentions, not an experience at all.

　　After the general distribution preparations of the agricultural cooperatives in the Shangrao area began, instances of concealing production were constantly discovered. We were eager to know the truth and how to solve the problem.

　　We visited relevant departments, but found no reliable clues. Truly, "we wore out iron shoes searching in vain," only to "find it without any effort." On November 8th, Comrade Lü Tingfan, a leader of the Rural Work Department of the Shangrao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, suddenly enthusiastically sent us a mimeographed document entitled "Several Experiences of Jiyang Township in Clearing Up Actual Production," telling us: This is a relatively good experience in dealing with the problem of concealing production; the county committee attaches great importance to it and has already been introduced to the Party organizations in each township by the Rural Work Department for study. The county committee's newspaper, "Shangrao Daily," has already published this experience on the front page with a prominent headline. Comrade Lü Tingfan also emphasized: "This was personally assisted by Comrade Jiang Guisen, a cadre dispatched by our Rural Work Department."

　　Without thanking him, we first read the material. Although this material was not long, it was narrated in a detailed and logical manner. It included the specific situation of concealing production - 16 out of 19 production teams in the entire cooperative collectively concealed production, and all the team leaders were involved; the process of solving this problem - including preparation, ideological mobilization, detailed methods, experience introduction, and finally four points of experience. The experience emphasized how to "rely on the masses and mobilize the masses," how to promote the working spirit of cadres who are "conscientious and responsible" and "thoroughly implement ideological mobilization work" to carry out education on love for the cooperative. As a result, the effect was very significant: the output was verified, and in nearly four days, more than 71,000 catties of concealed rice were uncovered.

　　This material was written in such a vivid and compelling manner that, with just a few more specific details, it would immediately become a report with universal educational significance. Therefore, that very afternoon, we braved the light rain of early winter and rushed to the Minfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Jiyang Township.

　　When we stepped into the Minfeng Agricultural Cooperative office (the Party General Branch and the Township People's Committee also work here), there were quite a few cadres sitting inside, some chatting and some dozing off.

　　We took out our letters of introduction and asked, "Is Comrade Jiang Guisen from the County Committee's Rural Work Department here?"

　　"Ah! You're here to understand our experience in clearing production? That's great, that's great, we were just planning to submit an article to the newspaper." A comrade who was engrossed in drawing a form quickly stood up, looked at the letter of introduction, and while smiling and shaking hands with us, greeted the cadres present: "Everyone, come forward, quickly introduce the situation of dealing with concealed production to the journalist comrades. The Party newspaper cares about us so much, everyone should explain it clearly."

　　The atmosphere in the office suddenly became tense, people stopped chatting, and those who were dozing off also opened their sleepy eyes, looking at each other in unison. After a moment, they whispered:

　　"I don't know the details, I can't talk about it!"

　　"That was done by him and the deputy secretary of the general branch, how can we introduce it?" "…………"

　　The conversation had just begun when they all slipped away one by one, leaving only Jiang Guisen and Zou Liangji, the deputy secretary of the township general branch, in the office. Seeing that a cold reception was occurring, Jiang Guisen quickly came up with an idea and said: "Okay, they all have work to do, I'll talk about the details first, and then let Lao Zou supplement."

　　He opened his notebook and said solemnly: "Let's first analyze the reasons for concealing production: First, it is possible that the masses are not familiar with the grain policy and have great ideological concerns; second, there may be suspicion between teams. In short, team cadres may have one-sided views of the masses, held a meeting in advance, and collectively concealed production."

　　"Possible? Did you investigate?" We couldn't help but interject.

　　"Don't think that 'possible' is not a fact." Jiang Guisen seemed a little unhappy with our question, and his tone immediately became serious: "This is the reason for concealing production pointed out by the county Party secretary at the last three-level cadre meeting. Although I have not investigated, the situation here must be no exception."

　　He became more and more energetic: "Hey, you don't know, the tricks of this cooperative in concealing production are really hard to figure out: some used old scales for intake and new scales for outtake; some had high intake scales and low outtake scales; some privately distributed a portion according to population or household first; and some reported less than they actually harvested. Unfortunately, I forgot to write it down when I compiled the material..."

　　"No, we haven't discovered these methods of concealing production yet. The grain produced is all in the team's warehouse. Those methods were mentioned by a responsible comrade at the district meeting." Zou Liangji felt that what Jiang Guisen said did not match the facts and immediately interjected to correct him.

　　"Look, your memory is really bad. Didn't I tell you a long time ago that they are keeping the grain in the warehouse now without distributing it, and it is estimated that they definitely have plans to distribute it, otherwise, why wouldn't the masses reveal a bit of information."

　　The material was all about affirmed facts. In the experience of fully mobilizing the masses to solve the problem of concealing production, it clearly stated "launching cooperative members to raise questions," so how could it all suddenly become "possible," "estimated," and "the masses not revealing information" when discussing the reasons for concealing production? We raised this question and repeatedly asked him to explain it in detail.

　　At this time, Jiang Guisen was a little dazed. He closed his notebook, rested his chin in his hand and pondered for a long time before slowly saying: "We have not mobilized the masses sufficiently enough, this is a shortcoming in our work, but objectively we are not allowed to do so. You analyze it, this period of winter planting, general election, plus grain procurement, several tasks are squeezed together, and we feel that there is not enough time to report the situation to the higher authorities every day, so there is no time to solicit the opinions of the masses. Fortunately, Lao Zou and I divided the work and cooperated to make a bold suspicion, held three meetings, and immediately clarified the problem of concealing production. Otherwise, don't even think about achieving this result."

　　"Yes! The role of those three meetings was indeed very significant." Jiang Guisen was talking about this, Zou Liangji immediately took over and said: "Take the meeting of cadres above the team leader level and the meeting of cooperative member representatives (both of which were attended by the main cadres of the team) as examples, Lao Jiang and I spent two whole nights talking to them: whoever conceals production and does not report will be punished by law; as the saying goes: 'Dead people cannot be buried in the snow,' 'Charcoal fire cannot be wrapped in paper,' we added some pressure to them, and in a few days, each team honestly reported the concealed production numbers."

　　Zou Liangji continued enthusiastically: "In addition, I personally conducted surprise account checking and inventory clearing work. I had long suspected that Zou Lianghai, the captain of the 13th team, would play tricks. I heard that he concealed production last year in the elementary cooperative. Now that he has transferred to the advanced cooperative, his hands and feet will definitely not be clean. That day, I took the opportunity to urge the delivery of public grain and gave him a surprise inspection in their team. It proved that my suspicion was 'very correct'. Their team's accounts showed more than 16,300 catties of rice than the number reported to the cooperative. The rice was in the warehouse, and they still gave reasons to deny it. In fact, the stolen goods were found, and they couldn't deny it."

　　"The breakthrough in solving concealed production has been opened, those concealing team leaders were also frightened, some cleared the warehouse overnight, and some took the initiative to 'confess' to us. We saved effort and also 'inspired' the cadres' consciousness, it was really a win-win situation."

　　His words were deeply submerged in their triumphant laughter...

　　We came to the 13th team where they opened the breakthrough. The situation of this team was originally like this: When harvesting mid-season rice, the storekeeper responsible for reporting the rice numbers to the cooperative went to visit relatives for four days, entrusting a cooperative member who often helped him with bookkeeping to temporarily replace his work. On the day he returned, that cooperative member happened to be sent out to engage in sideline occupations, and the two did not connect. That cooperative member has not returned to this day. The storekeeper was afraid of making mistakes and prepared to report it to the cooperative after clarifying the accounts when the cooperative member returned. When Zou Liangji came to check the accounts and inventory, the storekeeper immediately made an oral report to him, and the captain also reviewed that he had not fulfilled his responsibilities. However, Zou Liangji did not analyze the objective situation and insisted on saying that the grain stored in the warehouse and recorded in the accounts was collective concealed production. Jiang Guisen listened to Zou Liangji's report and added a crime of having a "united front" and "not allowing cooperative members to reveal information." When other teams learned about this situation, they were afraid of being labeled as "concealing production" and cleared the warehouse and settled accounts one after another. Some sent the late rice numbers that were originally prepared to be reported together with other autumn harvest crops to the cooperative overnight; some grain was not dried, so they had to report it first and then dry it... Even so, everyone still inevitably had to wear the hat of "concealing production". The team leaders stated their reasons to them, but they ignored them. When holding the meeting of cadres above the team leader level, it was their long and verbose "lecture" of "dead people cannot be buried in the snow", not giving everyone a chance to speak. The captain of the 13th team was so angry that he had no choice but to complain about himself, and criticize the storekeeper, saying that he was confused and "lost the face of the whole team". The storekeeper has been worried and afraid these days, fearing that he would go to jail, had no heart to produce, could not eat, and resolutely resigned. Some teams were also disturbed by this matter.

　　This is the origin of this "good experience" that is valued by the county Party committee and introduced everywhere by the Rural Work Department.

　　一个“好经验”的来历
　　胡焕明　陈秉彦
　　被中共上饶县委农村工作部到处介绍的一条“好经验”，原来是少数干部单凭主观意图捕风捉影制造出来的，根本不是什么经验。
    上饶地区各农业社总分配准备工作开始后，不断发现瞒产现象。真相怎样，解决的办法如何，我们很想知道。
    我们访问了有关部门，但没有可靠线索。真是“踏破铁鞋无觅处”，那知“得来全不费工夫”。11月8日，中共上饶县委农村工作部一位负责人——吕庭藩同志突然热情地送给我们一份“吉阳乡清理实产的几点体会”的油印材料，告诉我们：这是一个处理瞒产问题较好的经验，县委很重视，已由农村工作部将它介绍给各乡党组织学习去了。县委的机关报“上饶报”已经把这个经验放在一版头题的地位上刊登出来。吕庭藩同志还着重指出：“这是我们农村工作部派去的干事姜桂森同志亲自在那里协助搞的。”
    我们没有道谢就先看材料。这篇材料写的虽不长，却叙述得头头是道，有条有理。有瞒产的具体情况——全社十九个生产队，有十六个生产队集体瞒产，队长都参与其事；有解决这个问题的过程——包括准备工作，思想动员，详尽作法，经验介绍，最后还有四点体会。体会中着重强调了怎样“依靠群众，发动群众”，如何发扬干部“认真负责”的工作精神和“自始至终贯彻思想发动工作”，进行爱社教育。因此，效果十分显著：产量查实了，近四天中，搞出七万一千余斤瞒产稻谷。
    这份材料写得这样的有声有色，只要再补充一些具体内容，马上就是一篇有普遍教育意义的报道。于是就在当天下午，我们冒着初冬的细雨，赶到吉阳乡民锋农业社里。
    当我们跨进民锋农业社办公室
  （党总支、乡人民委员会也在这里办公）的时候，里面正坐着不少干部，有的在聊天，有的在打盹。
    我们掏出工作介绍信，问“县委农村工作部的姜桂森同志在吗？”
      “啊！是了解我们清产经验？那太好了，太好了，我们正打算向报纸投稿哩。”一位在埋头画表格的同志连忙站起来，看过介绍信后，一边笑嘻嘻地和我们握手，一边招呼在座的干部：“大家都到前面来，赶快向记者同志介绍处理瞒产情况，党报这样关心我们，大家要好好说清楚。”
    办公室的空气顿时紧张起来，人们停止了聊天，打盹的人也睁开了惺忪的睡眼，不约而同地互相看了一眼。片刻，他们小声地议论着：
      “我不摸底，谈也谈不出来呀！”
      “那是他和总支副书记搞的，叫我们怎样介绍呢？”“…………”
    谈话刚刚开始，他们就一个个地溜走了，办公室里只剩下了姜桂森和乡总支副书记邹良基。眼看着出现了冷场局面，还是姜桂森急中生智，连忙说：“好吧，他们都有工作，我先把详细情况谈一谈，然后让老邹补充。”
    他打开笔记本，郑重其事地说：“我们先来分析瞒产的原因：第一可能是群众对粮食政策不摸底，思想顾虑很大；第二可能是队与队之间有怀疑。总之，队里的干部可能存在片面的群众观点，预先开了会，集体来瞒产。”
    “可能？你们调查了吗？”我们忍不住插嘴问。
      “你们不要以为‘可能’就不是事实。”姜桂森似乎对我们的问话有点不高兴，语气马上变得沉重起来：“这是县委书记在上次三级干部会上指出来的瞒产原因，我虽没有调查，但这里的情况一定也不会例外。”
    他越说越有劲：“嗨，你们还不知道，这个社瞒产的花样真叫人难以捉摸：有的是用老秤进，新秤出；有的是进秤高，出秤低；有的是按人口或按户先私分了一部分；还有的是收多报少。可惜，我整理材料时忘记写上去。……”
    “不，我们现在还没有发现这些瞒产方法，搞出来的粮食都在队的仓库里，那些方法是在片的会上一位负责同志说的。”邹良基感到姜桂森说的情况不符合事实，立即插话纠正。
    “看，你的忘性真大，我早不是说过吗，他们现在把谷留在仓里没有分，估计一定有分的打算，不然，群众怎么不透露一点风声。”
    材料上写的全部是肯定的事实，在充分动员群众解决瞒产问题的经验中，还明明写着“发动社员提疑问点”一项，怎么现在谈起瞒产原因时，忽然全部变成了“可能”、“估计”和“群众不透露风声”呢？我们提出这个疑问，再三请他详细解释。
    这时，姜桂森有些发楞，他合上笔记本，手托住腮思索了许久，才慢吞吞地说：“我们发动群众还不够充分，这是我们工作中的缺点，不过，客观上不允许我们这样做。你们分析一下吧，这一段冬种、普选加上征购粮，几项工作挤在一起，每日向上级汇报情况都感到时间不够用，那有时间去征求群众意见。幸喜我和老邹分工合作，来个大胆怀疑，召开了三个会议，一下子把瞒产问题搞清楚了。要不然，别想取得这个成绩。”
    “是呀！那三个会议起的作用的确非常显著。”姜桂森谈到这里，邹良基即速把话接过来说：“就拿队长以上干部会和社员代表会（都是队的主要干部当代表）来说吧，我和老姜整整向他们讲了两个大半夜：谁要瞒产不报，将来受法律制裁；常言说：‘雪里埋不住死人’，
  ‘纸里包不住炭火’，给他们加了些压力，没有几天工夫，各队就老老实实把瞒产数字报上来了。”
    邹良基兴致勃勃地继续说下去：“另外我还亲自进行过突击查账清仓的工作。十三队队长邹良海，我早就怀疑他会捣鬼，去年在初级社听说他瞒了产，今年转了高级社，手脚也一定不会干净。那天我借催送公粮名义到他们队里措手不及地给他来个大检查，果然证明我的怀疑‘十分正确’，他们队的账上比向社里报的稻谷数字多一万六千三百多斤。稻谷在仓库里放着，他们还提出理由不承认，其实赃证都找出来了，赖也赖不掉。”
      “解决瞒产的缺口打开了，那些瞒产的队长也吓慌了，有的连夜清仓，有的主动向我们‘交代’，我们力气省了，也‘启发’了干部的自觉，真是一举两得。”
    他的话，深深地淹没在他们得意的笑声里。……
    我们来到了他们打开缺口的第十三队。这个队的情况原来是这样：割中稻时，负责统计向社里汇报稻谷数字的保管员走了四天亲戚，委托一个经常给他帮忙记账的社员暂时代替他的工作。他回来那天，那个社员恰巧被派出搞副业去了，两下没接头，那个社员直到现在还没有回来，保管员怕出错误，准备等到那个社员回来将账目弄清楚，再报到社里。当邹良基来查账盘仓时，保管员马上向他作了口头报告，队长还检讨了自己工作没有尽到责任。可是邹良基不分析客观情况，硬把他们在仓里放着的、账上记着的粮食说成是集体瞒产。姜桂森听了邹良基的汇报，又给他们加上了一个订有“攻守同盟”、“不准社员透露消息”的罪名。其他各队得知这个情况，都怕戴上“瞒产”的帽子，纷纷清仓结账，有的将原来准备和其他秋收作物一同上报的晚稻稻谷数字连夜送到社里；有的谷未晒干，也只好先报后晒……。就这样大家也还难免要戴“瞒产”的帽子。队长们向他们申述理由，他们也置之不理。召开队长以上干部会时，又是他们“雪里埋不住死人”的长篇大论的“训话”，不让大家有发言机会。十三队队长气的没办法，只好埋怨自己，又去批评保管员，说他糊糊涂涂“丢了全队的脸”。保管员近日来又是愁，又是怕，耽心会坐班房，无心生产，吃不下饭，坚决辞职不干。还有些队也为此事闹得人心惶惶。
    这就是这个被县委重视、被农村工作部到处介绍的“好经验”的来历。
