    Dawu County, Hubei Province Transfers Cattle to Support Other Areas

    (Our Newspaper) News report: Dawu County, Hubei Province, is a mountainous area with a relatively large number of cattle, and can transfer some cattle to other areas. In the past, due to overly complicated inter-regional exchange procedures, many farmers from other places who came to buy cattle were turned away because of so-called “non-compliant procedures.” Within the county, agricultural cooperatives regarded these cattle as a burden due to the excessive number of idle cattle. Since October, Dawu County, according to the instructions of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, has abolished the regulations blocking livestock between regions, which has been welcomed by the masses. The local agricultural and supply and marketing departments actively introduced the situation to farmers from other places who came to buy cattle, and guided them to purchase in the producing areas. In the past two months, a total of 939 cattle have been sold to eight counties in this province and Henan Province. The supply of these cattle has caught up with winter plowing and winter planting, and agricultural cooperatives in this county have also received more than 60,000 yuan from the sale of surplus cattle.

    湖北大悟县调出耕牛支援外区
    本报讯湖北省大悟县是山区，耕牛较多，可以调剂部分耕牛给外区。过去由于地区交流手续过繁，很多外地来购牛的农民，因所谓“手续不合”跑了空路；而县内也因闲牛过多，农业社把这些牛看成负担。自10月份开始，大悟县根据湖北省委的指示取消了牲畜地区之间封锁的规定，受到群众的欢迎。当地农业部门和供销部门积极向来买牛的外地农民介绍情况，指导他们到产区采购。两个月来共卖给本省和河南省的八个县耕牛九百三十九头，这些耕牛的供应赶上了冬耕冬种，本县农业社也因余牛销售得款六万多元。　　（杨纯　容忍之）
