Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 29th: Representatives and observers attending the Asian Writers' Conference began a round table conference on the afternoon of the 28th, chaired by Italian writer Carlo Levi.

    The conference has no specific agenda or topics, and writers can freely discuss the issue of how to promote cultural exchange between East and West.

    Dr. Johnson of the Gold Coast said in his speech that the African continent is currently in action, "In the coming years, Africans will express their opinions in the international family with their own voices and demand their rights as a part of all mankind." After Dr. Johnson finished speaking, the whole audience stood up and cheered for a long time.

    Mao Dun, head of the Chinese Writers Delegation, said: We Asian writers have never discriminated against Western culture. We believe that the people of Asian countries and the people of Western countries have the right to inherit all the best cultures of mankind.

    He explained the necessity of uniting and cooperating with writers from other parts of the world. He also called on Asian writers to unite to safeguard world peace, promote their own national cultures, and strengthen their cultural exchanges with each other.

    Hungarian novelist A. Tamás expressed his infinite confidence in the future of his country in his speech. He also emphasized that Hungarian writers need to work hard to serve the people.

    K. B. Christiansson, editor of the Australian "Literary Magazine," called for a wider exchange of literary works and mutual visits between Australian writers and writers from Asian countries.

    Latin American observers, poet Salamia-Borda and novelist M. A. Asturias, reported on the close ties established with Indian writers through correspondence and publishing each other's literary works. They requested similar bilateral arrangements with writers from other Asian countries.

    Indian novelist Tarashankar Bannerjee welcomed the proposal to hold a world writers' conference.

    Monica Felton of the United Kingdom advocated publishing an Asian literary magazine to familiarize others with the current literary creations of Asian writers.

    Iranian poet laureate Nafisi said that writers should look for the protagonists of their works in the dark corners of society, in factories and rural areas, and not wait until these mass leaders are officially recognized before describing them.

    Soviet poet Simonov said that the Asian Writers' Conference demonstrated the further development of culture. It was impossible to imagine holding such a conference fifteen years ago, but today it has become a reality. He said: "As long as we remember that the people support us, we will not talk about a cultural crisis but only about the advancement of culture. In the process of cultural advancement, the Asian people are standing in a position that belongs to them according to their rights."

    Romanian writer Zaharia Stancu said that writers should try to work for the realization of the people's prosperous era. He hoped that this Asian Writers' Conference would be the starting point for establishing a world organization of writers.

    新华社新德里29日电　参加亚洲作家会议的代表和观察员28日下午开始举行圆桌会议，由意大利作家卡洛·勒维担任主席。
    会议没有具体的议程和议题，作家们可以就如何促进东西方文化交流这个问题自由交谈。
    黄金海岸的约翰逊博士在发言的时候说，非洲大陆目前正在行动，“在今后几年内，非洲人将要用自己的声音在国际大家庭中发表自己的意见，并且要求自己的作为全人类的一部分的权利”。在约翰逊博士说完这些话以后，全场起立，欢呼经久不息。
    中国作家代表团团长茅盾说：我们亚洲作家从来不歧视西方文化，我们认为，亚洲各国人民和西方各国人民都有权继承人类的一切最优秀的文化。
    他说明必须同世界其他地方的作家们团结合作。他还要求亚洲作家团结起来，保障世界和平，发扬自己的民族文化，并且加强他们相互之间的文化交流。
    匈牙利小说家阿·托马什在发言中表示对他的国家的前途抱有无限信心。他还着重指出，匈牙利作家有必要刻苦努力为人民服务。
    澳大利亚“文学杂志”编辑克·布·克里斯蒂安逊要求更广泛地交换文艺作品，并且由澳大利亚作家和亚洲国家的作家互相访问。
    拉丁美洲的观察员、诗人萨拉米亚—波尔达和小说家姆·阿·阿斯杜里亚斯报告了通过通信和出版彼此的文艺著作的方法同印度作家建立密切联系的情形。他们要求同其他亚洲国家的作家们也作出同样的双边安排。

    苏联诗人西蒙诺夫说，亚洲作家会议表现了文化的进一步发展。十五年以前是不可能设想举行这种会议的，而今天却成了现实。他说：“只要我们记住人民支持着我们，我们就不会谈到文化危机而只会谈到文化的前进。在文化的前进过程中，亚洲人民正站在根据自己的权利而属于他们的地位上。”
    罗马尼亚作家查霍里亚·斯坦克说，作家们应当设法为实现人民的繁荣时代而努力。他希望这次亚洲作家会议成为建立作家们的世界组织的起点。
