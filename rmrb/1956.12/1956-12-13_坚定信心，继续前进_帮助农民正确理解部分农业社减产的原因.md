    Firmly Establish Confidence, Continue to Advance
    -- Helping Farmers Correctly Understand the Reasons for Reduced Production in Some Agricultural Cooperatives
    Commentator of this newspaper

    Judging from the results of the autumn harvest distribution in agricultural cooperatives across various regions: In non-disaster areas, the vast majority of cooperatives had bumper harvests this year, and the income of the vast majority of members increased significantly; in lightly affected disaster areas, many cooperatives, after various efforts, managed to avoid production reduction or income reduction despite the disaster, so that the income of the vast majority of members still increased to varying degrees, or maintained the level of last year. This fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist economy.

    However, in various regions, there are some cooperatives that unfortunately experienced reduced production, either due to severe natural disasters, or due to one-sided emphasis on grain production and neglect of diversified operations and sideline production, or due to the inability to adapt to local conditions in the reform of agricultural technology and cultivation systems, or due to excessive investment in basic construction, or due to neglect of the principle of thrift in business management.

    In these cooperatives with reduced production, many members are currently experiencing ideological confusion and emotional turmoil. Some people are complaining about the cooperative cadres, saying that it is all because of their subjectivism and forced orders that production has been ruined. Some people are complaining about collectivization, saying that "the road to socialism is getting narrower and narrower," so they are passive in production and even propose withdrawing from the cooperative. Some cooperative cadres also believe that "what is the point of talking about superiority if production is reduced?" They are not confident and lose confidence in continuing to run the cooperative well. If this kind of thinking is not clarified as soon as possible, it will affect the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the improvement of production.

    During the upsurge of collectivization last winter and this spring, various regions vigorously publicized the superiority of collectivization and conducted long-term education for members on the happy life of socialism. This was very necessary. However, there was insufficient publicity about what difficulties agricultural cooperatives might encounter in their progress and what arduous processes they would have to go through to run the cooperative well. At present, this lesson should be well supplemented in these cooperatives with reduced production. It should be explained to the members that in the first year of running the cooperative, everyone has no experience, and it is inevitable that a small number of cooperatives will suffer some losses in production due to various reasons. It is difficult to guarantee 100% success in any new undertaking, without any problems or difficulties. However, these problems and difficulties are temporary, and are problems and difficulties in progress. It has nothing to do with the collective system itself. We cannot blame collectivization for production reduction caused by any reason. We should specifically analyze the reasons for the reduction in production and income, so that members can realize that the reduction in production and income is caused by disasters or some shortcomings in the work, not because the advanced cooperative system itself is not good; we should not confuse some shortcomings in the work with the superiority of the collectivization system. We should not think that there is nothing to talk about in terms of superiority if production is reduced. It should be clearly told to the members that our leadership in organizing farmers to run cooperatives and take the socialist road is completely correct. Most cooperatives have increased production, the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man has been eliminated in the vast rural areas, the phenomenon of polarization has disappeared, the exploiting class will also be transformed into self-reliant people, and the old, weak, and orphaned have received appropriate care. Can it still be said that collectivization has no superiority? Of course, we have shortcomings in leading the work of collectivization. For example, in the first half of the year, many places did not pay enough attention to the development of diversified operations and sideline production; some cooperatives controlled their members too rigidly; some places were somewhat blind in the reform of cultivation techniques and cultivation systems; some cadres had some subjectivist and commandist styles in their work; and many cooperatives still lacked experience in business management. All of these have adverse effects on the development of cooperative production. However, it should be pointed out that these shortcomings can be corrected. As long as everyone reaches a consensus, finds the real reasons for the reduction in production and income, and summarizes and accepts this year's lessons of production reduction, these shortcomings and mistakes will not be repeated next year, and the level of business management will be improved. On this basis, the production of agricultural cooperatives will definitely increase year by year.

    Of course, it is not enough to explain these principles to the members, it is more important to actively find ways to make up for the loss of reduced production. We must mobilize members to open up various production avenues, tap the potential of various winter sideline production, and criticize the erroneous understanding that "the reduction in income is fixed and there is no way to think about it" with examples. Party and government leading cadres in many areas of Shanxi Province, in order to help cooperatives with reduced production strive not to reduce income, led agricultural cooperative members to widely carry out winter sideline production. In Zuoyun County, 54 agricultural cooperatives, within one month of the autumn harvest distribution, the income from sideline production has reached more than 9,470 yuan, and it is estimated that by the end of the year, it can basically reach the level of last year's income. In order to help cooperatives with reduced production make up for the loss of reduced production, the party and government leading organs of Yingde County, Guangdong Province, held meetings of directors of cooperatives with reduced production at the county and district levels to help them formulate plans for winter planting and developing sideline production, and sent a group of cadres to the cooperatives to assist the cooperative cadres in mobilizing the masses to solve the difficulties in production and members' lives, so that the county completed the winter planting plan ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. In terms of sideline production, according to the statistics of only 21 cooperatives with reduced production, they have now received more than 70,000 yuan in cash income, which has largely made up for the loss of reduced production. As a result, those previously wavering members no longer wavered, and most of the members who wanted to withdraw from the cooperative also stabilized.

    Facts have proved that as long as we do a good job in ideological education politically, make up for the loss of reduced production economically, and guide the members and cadres of the cooperative to unite as one, improve management, and do a good job in production, the negative complaints of the members will be reversed, and the positive factors will be promoted.

    坚定信心，继续前进
    ——帮助农民正确理解部分农业社减产的原因
    本报评论员
    从各地农业社秋收分配的结果来看：在非灾区，绝大多数的合作社今年丰产了，绝大多数的社员收入显著增加；在轻灾区，有不少合作社经过各种努力后，也做到了受灾不减产或受灾不减收，使绝大多数的社员收入仍有不同程度的增加，或是保持了去年的水平。这充分地显示了社会主义经济的优越性。
    但是，各地却都有一些合作社，或是由于遭受严重的自然灾害，或是由于片面地强调粮食生产、忽视了多种经营和副业生产，或是由于在农业技术和耕作制度改革中不能因地制宜，或是由于基本建设投资过大，或是由于经营管理上忽视了节约的原则，不幸减产。
    在这些减产的农业社里，目前有许多社员思想混乱，情绪动荡。有些人在埋怨社干部，说都是因为他们主观主义、强迫命令，把生产搞坏了。有些人在埋怨合作化，说什么“社会主义的道路越走越窄”，于是生产消极，甚至提出退社。而一部分社干部也认为“减产了还谈什么优越性”，理不直，气不壮，甚至对继续办好合作社失掉了信心。这种思想如不及早澄清，将会影响农业社的巩固和生产的改进。
    在去冬今春的合作化高潮时期，各地曾大张旗鼓地宣传了合作化的优越性，向社员进行了社会主义幸福生活的远景教育。这是十分必要的。但是，对农业社在前进中可能遇到什么困难，要把社办好还要经过那些艰苦的过程，却宣传的非常不够。目前，在这些减产社应该很好地补上这一课。要向社员说明：办社第一年，大家都没有经验，难免有少数的社，由于这样或那样的原因，使生产受到一定程度的损失。任何一项新的事业都很难保证得到百分之百的成功，一点问题也不出，一点困难也没有。但是，这些问题和困难是暂时的，是前进中的问题和困难。它和合作制度本身并没有什么必然的关系。不能把不管什么原因造成的减产都归咎于合作化。应该具体地分析减产减收的原因，使社员认识减产减收是因为受灾或工作中的某些缺点造成的，而不是高级社制度本身不好；不要把工作中的某些缺点和合作化制度的优越性混淆起来。不应该认为减了产就没有什么优越性可讲了。应该明确地告诉社员：我们领导农民办社，走社会主义道路，是完全走对了。大多数合作社增产了，在广大的农村中人剥削人的现象消灭了，两极分化的现象没有了，剥削阶级也将被改造成自食其力者，老弱孤寡得到了适当的照顾。这还能说合作化没有优越性吗？当然，我们在领导合作化工作中是有缺点的。比如在前半年，许多地方对发展多种经营和副业生产注意不够；部分社对社员统的太死、卡的太严；有些地方在耕作技术和耕作制度的改革中有些盲目性；部分干部在工作中有一些主观主义和命令主义的作风；许多社在经营管理方面的经验还很缺乏。所有这些，对发展合作社的生产都有不利的影响。但是，应该指出，这些缺点是能够改正的。只要大家认识一致，找到减产减收的真正原因，总结和接受今年的减产教训，明年就不会重复这些缺点和错误，经营管理的水平就会提高一步。在这基础上，农业社的生产定会一年比一年提高。
    当然，光向社员说明这些道理还不行，更重要的是积极设法弥补减产的损失。要发动社员开辟各种生产门路，发掘各种冬季副业生产的潜力，用实例批判那种“减收已定，无法可想”的错误认识。山西省许多地区的党政领导干部，为帮助减产社争取不减收，领导农业社员广泛地开展了冬季副业生产。左云县五十四个农业社，在秋收分配的一个月中，副业生产的收入就已经达到九千四百七十多元，预计干到年底基本上能达到去年收入的水平。广东省英德县的党政领导机关，为了帮助减产社弥补减产损失，县和区都召开了减产社主任会议，帮助他们订出冬种和开展副业生产的规划，并增派了一批干部到社协助社干部发动群众解决生产和社员生活上的困难，使全县提早并超额完成冬种计划。在副业生产方面，仅据二十一个减产社的统计，现在已经得到现金收入七万多元，在很大程度上弥补了减产损失。于是，那些先前动摇的社员不再动摇了，想退社的社员也大部稳定下来了。
    事实证明，只要我们从政治上做好思想教育，从经济上弥补减产损失，引导社员群众和社干部团结一心，改进经营，搞好生产，社员中的那种消极埋怨情绪就会扭转过来，积极的因素就会发扬起来。
