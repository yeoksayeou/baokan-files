Annotations on Several Terms in the Hendrikh Report

    **Kautskyism**
    Kautskyism is a most typical opportunist and revisionist doctrine. Kautsky (1854-1938) was a member of the German Social Democratic Party. In the golden age of his activities, he was once a Marxist, but later he completely fell into the quagmire of opportunism and became a traitor to the working class. Kautsky negated the necessity of destroying the bourgeois state machine and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and put forward the liberal bourgeois theory of "pure" democracy and "supra-class" democracy. His theory of "ultra-imperialism" held that "capitalism may well experience a new phase," and that "the policy of joint exploitation of the whole world by internationally united financial capital will replace the policy of mutual struggle between financial capital of various countries." The purpose of this theory was to deceive the masses, conceal the decadent nature of the capitalist system, the sharp contradictions between imperialists, and the possibility of wars caused thereby. He wanted to make people believe that imperialism was not so bad, saying that it would soon turn into ultra-imperialism capable of guaranteeing permanent peace.

    **Bernsteinism**
    Bernsteinism is one of the earliest forms of opportunist and revisionist doctrine in the workers' movement. Bernstein (1850-1932) was one of the leaders of the German Social Democratic Party. In the name of revising Marxism, he negated and distorted the basic principles of Marxism. He opposed Marx's theory of class struggle and socialism, believing that the only task of the workers' movement was to strive for some improvement in the economic conditions of workers under the capitalist system. Therefore, the essence of Bernsteinism is to make the working masses forget the fundamental interests of the working class for the sake of temporary practical or false interests, and to abolish the revolutionary struggle of the working class to achieve socialism.

    In philosophy, Bernstein mixed Marxism with idealism and Kantianism in an unprincipled manner. Lenin exposed and criticized Bernstein's reactionary revisionist views in works such as "Marxism and Revisionism," "What Is To Be Done?", and "State and Revolution."

    **Anarchism**
    Anarchism is an ideological system of the petty bourgeoisie and the lumpenproletariat. It advocates the abolition of all political power and state in society under any historical conditions, especially hostile to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and opposes political struggle and the political parties of the working class. It puts the individual and individual interests first, rather than the interests of the working masses; it denies that the individual can only be liberated by freeing the people from the oppression and enslavement of capital, and denies that the socialist revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat are necessary to realize socialism.

    Historically, anarchism has manifested itself in various forms, such as anarchist individualism, anarcho-syndicalism, anarcho-communism, etc., but its essence is the irreconcilable enemy of scientific communism. In the past, various anarchists formed counter-revolutionary parties and became actual defenders of capitalism and even fascism.

    **Industrial Revolution**
    At the end of the 18th century, British industry and commerce developed rapidly, and the need for commodities increased day by day. This situation promoted the invention of machines, so that machine production replaced manual production, and factories employing workers for large-scale production replaced handicraft workshops. At the same time, a new type of industrial bourgeoisie and its gravedigger – the proletariat – also began to take shape. This technical reform of replacing manual production with machine production marks a sudden change in the productive forces, generally known as the Industrial Revolution. (First)

    亨德里赫报告中的几个名词的注释
    考茨基主义
    考茨基主义是一种最典型的机会主义和修正主义学说。考茨基（1854—1938）是德国社会民主党人。他在活动的黄金时代曾经是一个马克思主义者，但是后来就完全滚进了机会主义的泥坑，成为工人阶级的叛徒。考茨基否定摧毁资产阶级国家机器和建立无产阶级专政的必要性，提出了关于“纯粹”民主和“超阶级”民主的自由资产阶级理论。他的“超帝国主义”论，认为“资本主义不是不可能再经历一个新的阶段”，而“用国际联合财政资本共同剥削全世界的办法代替各国财政资本相互斗争的政策”。这种理论的目的在于欺骗群众，掩饰资本主义制度的腐朽性、帝国主义之间的尖锐矛盾和因而引起战争的可能性。他想使人相信帝国主义并不很坏，说它很快就要变为能够保障永久和平的超帝国主义。
    伯恩斯坦主义
    伯恩斯坦主义是工人运动中出现最早的一种机会主义和修正主义的学说。伯恩斯坦（1850—1932）是德国社会民主党领袖之一。他以修改马克思主义为名，否定并歪曲了马克思主义的基本原理。他反对马克思的阶级斗争理论和社会主义学说，认为工人运动的唯一任务就是在资本主义制度下争取工人经济状况的某些改善。因此，伯恩斯坦主义的实质，就是要工人群众为了暂时的实际利益或虚假利益而忘记了工人阶级的根本利益，取消工人阶级争取实现社会主义的革命斗争。
    在哲学上，伯恩斯坦把马克思主义和唯心主义、康德主义无原则地混合起来。列宁在“马克思主义和修正主义”、“做什么？”、“国家与革命”等著作中揭露并批判了伯恩斯坦这种反动的修正主义观点。
    无政府主义
    无政府主义是一种小资产阶级和流氓无产阶级的思想体系。它宣传在任何历史条件下废除社会中的一切政权和国家，特别敌视无产阶级专政，反对政治斗争和工人阶级的政党。它把个人和个人利益置于首位，而不是把劳动群众的利益置于首位；它否认只有使人民群众摆脱资本的压迫和奴役才能解放个人，否认要实现社会主义就必须进行社会主义革命和建立无产阶级专政。
    在历史上，无政府主义曾表现出各种各样的形式，如无政府个人主义、无政府工团主义、无政府共产主义等等，但其实质都是科学共产主义理论的不可调和的敌人。在过去，形形色色的无政府主义者曾组成了反革命的党派，成了资本主义甚至是法西斯主义的实际维护者。
    产业革命
    十八世纪末叶，英国工商业迅速发展，对商品的需要日益增长。这种情况，促成了机器的发明，从而机器生产代替了手工生产，雇佣工人进行大规模生产的工厂代替了手工业工场。同时，新型的工业资产阶级和它的掘墓人——无产阶级也开始形成了。这种用机器生产代替手工生产的技术改革，标志着生产力的突变，一般称为产业革命。（先）
