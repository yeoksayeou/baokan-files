    National People's Congress Deputies and CPPCC Members
    Continue Inspection Work in Various Regions

    Inspecting Cultural Relic Excavation Work and History Teaching Work in Henan

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Yin Da, National People's Congress deputy and historian, recently inspected the cultural relic excavation work and history teaching work in Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. In contact with many cultural relic excavation workers, Yin Da learned that the mutual coordination of cultural relic excavation work and basic construction work is very important. Although some units have paid attention to this issue, some units still do not attach importance to cultural relic excavation. In addition, due to the current shortage of staff and cadres being busy with fieldwork, how to improve their professional level is also a problem. Cultural relic excavation workers suggested to Yin Da that relevant departments strengthen leadership, organize visits, and exchange experiences in this regard.

    In Zhengzhou, Yin Da also inspected in detail the remains of the ancient Shang Dynasty wall and kiln sites that are being excavated, visited the work team's warehouse and studio, and studied relevant materials. He put forward suggestions for improvement on how to do a good job in excavation and indoor sorting, especially how to write excavation reports.

    During the inspection in Kaifeng, in order to be close to the masses, Yin Da lived in Kaifeng Normal College. During the day, he held small seminars, and in the evenings and spare time, he had free conversations with teachers individually to deeply understand the teaching work and scientific research work of teachers, especially veteran professors. Based on the information learned from the inspection, Yin Da made suggestions to the school's leadership on further leveraging the expertise and enthusiasm of veteran professors and strengthening the unity of new and veteran teachers.

    Suggesting Fujian Improve Scientific Research Work

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Liu Chongle, National People's Congress deputy and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Huang Nong, member of the National Committee of the CPPCC and deputy to the Fujian Provincial People's Congress, on the 22nd, put forward opinions and suggestions to Xu Ya, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province, and others regarding scientific research work in Fujian Province.

    Liu Chongle and Huang Nong found during the inspection that the scientific research departments in Fujian Province do not have enough contact with each other when formulating scientific research plans. Therefore, some research topics are the same, wasting efforts, and some departments have not placed their main efforts on urgently needed research areas. Preventing and controlling filariasis is more important than preventing and controlling schistosomiasis in Fujian Province, but the research force in this area is very weak. Sugarcane is an important agricultural product in Fujian, but there are very few scientific research topics related to sugarcane. Liu Chongle and Huang Nong believe that this situation must be changed. They suggest that Fujian Province establish a consultative body to lead scientific research work to coordinate the scientific research work of various scientific research departments. They also suggested that relevant departments should pay attention to the training and improvement of intermediate-level researchers and make full use of existing scientific research conditions, and compile existing books and periodicals in various libraries into a comprehensive catalog and distribute them to various scientific research departments for full utilization.

    Xu Ya, Deputy Governor of Fujian Province, and responsible persons of relevant departments stated that they would carefully study their opinions and suggestions to improve the province's scientific research work.

    Providing Improvement Suggestions on the Compilation of National Folk Art in Guangxi

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Ma Sicong, National People's Congress deputy and musician, concluded his inspection work in Guangxi Province on the 21st. Before leaving, he expressed some opinions on the work of compiling national folk art in Guangxi Province.

    Ma Sicong told reporters: Guangxi Province has made great efforts and achieved considerable results in compiling folk music, songs, and dances of various ethnic groups.

    Ma Sicong continued: However, when compiling folk art of various ethnic groups, we must not process it based on subjective imagination, so as not to damage the original unique style. Ma Sicong cited an example: "Shrimp Catching Dance" was originally a Zhuang ethnic group song and dance with a strong lyrical atmosphere, but after processing, it lost its original sentiment and looked a bit like a drama scene. The girls learned the shy expressions of Peking Opera actresses, and could not see the Zhuang girls' generous and cheerful character. What is even more strange is that the music of several different ethnic songs and dances performed by the Autonomous Prefecture Song and Dance Troupe are similar in rhythm and melody. Taking the Lusheng Dance as an example, in the accompaniment music, the sound of instruments such as the violin covers the sound of the lusheng, which appears noisy and loses its original flavor.

    Ma Sicong finally told reporters: I believe that the literary and art workers in Guangxi Province will unearth more and better artistic works after improving their working methods.

    Criticism and Suggestions on Issues such as Equal Pay for Equal Work for Women in Some Rural Areas of Hebei

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The inspection work of Liu Qingyang, National People's Congress deputy, and Jin Baoshan, member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, in Hebei Province has ended.

    Deputy Liu Qingyang inspected four agricultural production cooperatives in Baoding City. She learned that as a result of promoting close planting of corn, cotton, and early sowing of cotton this year, in addition to a small number of areas increasing production compared with previous years, most areas have reduced production. Based on this situation, she suggested that in the future, when promoting advanced agricultural production experience, the specific conditions of local soil and climate must be considered, and measures should be adapted to local conditions to avoid losses. Liu Qingyang also learned that some production teams in agricultural cooperatives still have unreasonable phenomena in arranging labor and implementing equal pay for equal work for men and women. She suggested that the heads of agricultural cooperatives organize various production teams to exchange experiences in arranging labor, and should also regularly check the implementation of equal pay for equal work for men and women in various production teams.

    Committee member Jin Baoshan inspected scientific and health work in Shijiazhuang City. He suggested that more covered manure pools should be set up at manure transfer stations, so that the manure can ferment due to long-term storage in the pools, and the eggs of intestinal parasites and bacteria of diseases such as typhoid fever and dysentery will be destroyed, and the manure will also have a more mature fertilizer value. Jin Baoshan also went deep into the streets to understand the residents' handling of garbage and manure, and inspected the medical and health conditions of factories in Shijiazhuang City. He believes that the local medical and health authorities do not conduct enough tests and research on the harmfulness of dust and toxic gases to the human body in factories. He criticized this situation and hoped that relevant authorities would improve it.

    Establishing Extensive Contacts with the People in Zhejiang

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Tong Dizhou, Zhao Zhongyao, Gu Gongxu, Zhang Manjun, National People's Congress deputies, and Zhao Jiuzhang, member of the National Committee of the CPPCC, who went to Zhejiang Province for inspection work, established extensive contacts with heads of universities, scientists, professors, young teachers, and people from various democratic parties during the inspection process. Many seminars were held in Hangzhou and Ningbo to listen to opinions.

    When inspecting universities and scientific research institutions, the deputies and committee members went deep into the laboratories to talk with working professors and scientific workers and solicit their opinions.

    After the news of the deputies and committee members' inspection in Zhejiang was published in local newspapers, the people wrote letters to welcome them, and some even asked the deputies to help solve problems in their letters. The deputies and committee members personally answered all these letters one by one.

    全国人民代表大会代表和政协委员
    在各地继续视察工作
    在河南视察文物发掘工作和历史教学工作
    据新华社讯　全国人民代表大会代表、历史学家尹达最近视察了郑州和开封两市的文物发掘工作和历史教学工作等情况。尹达在同许多文物发掘工作人员接触中，了解到文物发掘工作和基本建设工作的相互配合是非常重要的。现在虽然有些单位已注意到这个问题，但是仍然有些单位对文物的发掘没有重视。另外，由于目前工作人员缺少，干部忙于田野发掘工作，在这种情况下，怎样提高本身业务水平也是一个问题。文物发掘工作人员向尹达提出，希望有关部门加强领导，组织参观，交流这方面的经验。
    尹达在郑州还详细地视察了正在挖掘的商代古墙的遗迹和陶窑等工地，视察了工作队的仓库和工作室，研究了有关资料，对如何作好发掘工作和室内的整理工作，特别是如何作发掘报告等方面，提出了改进意见。
    在开封视察期间，尹达为了便于接近群众，他住在开封师范学院里，白天举行小型座谈会，晚上和空闲时间个别地同教师们自由谈心，深入了解教师、特别是老教授们的教学工作和科学研究工作等情况。根据视察所了解的情况，尹达向这个学校的领导方面提出了进一步发挥老教授的专长和积极性以及加强新老教师的团结等建议。
    建议福建改进科学研究工作
    据新华社讯　全国人民代表大会代表、中国科学院学部委员刘崇乐和政协全国委员会委员、福建省人民代表大会代表黄农，22日就福建省科学研究工作向福建省副省长许亚等人提出意见和建议。
    刘崇乐和黄农在视察中发现福建省各科学研究部门在拟订科学研究计划时互相联系不够，因此有些研究题目彼此雷同，浪费力量，有些部门未将主要力量放在迫切需要研究的方面，福建省防治血丝虫病比防治血吸虫病显得更加重要，但这方面的研究力量很薄弱。甘蔗是福建重要农产品，但有关甘蔗的科学研究题目很少。刘崇乐和黄农认为这种情况必须改变，他们建议福建省成立领导科学研究工作的谘询性机构，来协调各科学研究部门的科学研究工作。他们还建议有关部门应重视中级研究人员的培养提高工作和充分利用现有科学研究条件，将各图书馆现有书刊统一编成综合目录印发各科学研究部门，以便充分利用。
    福建省副省长许亚和有关部门负责人表示，将仔细研究他们的意见和建议，来改进本省的科学研究工作。
    对广西整理民族民间艺术提出改进意见
    据新华社讯　全国人民代表大会代表、音乐家马思聪21日结束了在广西省的视察工作。临行前，他对广西省整理民族民间文艺工作，发表了一些意见。
    马思聪对记者说：广西省在整理各民族的民间音乐歌舞方面，作了很大努力，也取得了不小的成绩。
    马思聪接着说：但是，在整理各民族的民间艺术时，千万不能凭主观想像来加工，以至损伤原有的独特风格。马思聪举例说：“捞虾舞”原是僮族的一个抒情气氛很浓的歌舞，但经过加工后，却失去了原有情调，有点像话剧场面了。姑娘们学着京剧旦角妞妮害羞的表情，看不到僮族姑娘大方、爽朗的性格。更奇怪的是：自治州歌舞团演出的几个不同民族的歌舞音乐，节奏旋律都差不多。拿芦笙舞来说，伴奏的音乐中，小提琴等乐器的声音遮盖了芦笙的声音，显得嘈杂，而且失去了原有风味。
    马思聪最后对记者说：我相信，广西省的文艺工作者在改进工作方法后将会发掘出更多更好的艺术作品来。
    对河北部分农村妇女同工不同酬等问题提出批评建议
    据新华社讯　全国人民代表大会代表刘清扬、政协全国委员会委员金宝善在河北省的视察工作已经结束。
    刘清扬代表在保定市视察了四个农业生产合作社。她了解到当地今年推广玉米、棉花密植和棉花早播种的结果，除少数地区较往年增加了产量以外，大部分地区都减产。根据这一情况，她建议今后推广农业先进生产经验的时候，必须考虑当地的土壤、气候等具体条件，因地制宜，以免造成损失。刘清扬还了解到农业社里有的生产队在安排劳动力和实行男女同工同酬方面还存在着不合理的现象，她建议各农业社的负责人组织各生产队互相交流安排劳动力的经验，并且要经常检查各生产队执行男女同工同酬的情况。
    金宝善委员在石家庄市视察了科学卫生工作。他建议粪便转运站应当多设加盖的粪池，使粪便在池内能因长时间的储藏而发酵，肠寄生虫卵和伤寒、痢疾等疾病的细菌就会遭到破坏，粪便也具有更成熟的肥料价值。金宝善还深入街道，了解居民处理垃圾和粪便的情况，并且视察了石家庄市工厂的医疗卫生情况。他认为当地的医疗卫生机关对工厂中的粉尘和有毒气体等对人体的危害性的化验和研究不够。他对这种情况提出了批评，并且希望有关机关加以改进。
    在浙江同人民群众取得广泛的联系
    据新华社讯　到浙江省视察工作的全国人民代表大会代表童第周、赵忠尧、顾功叙、张曼筠和政协全国委员会委员赵九章等，在视察过程中同各高等学校的负责人、科学家、教授、青年教师和各民主党派人士等进行了广泛联系。在杭州和宁波等地曾经举行了很多次座谈会，听取意见。
    代表和委员们在视察高等学校和科学研究机构的时候，深入实验室同正在工作的教授、科学工作者交谈，征求他们的意见。
    代表和委员们到浙江视察的消息在当地报纸上发表以后，人民群众纷纷写信表示欢迎他们，有的还在信上请求代表们帮助解决问题。代表和委员们对这些来信都亲自一一作了答复。
