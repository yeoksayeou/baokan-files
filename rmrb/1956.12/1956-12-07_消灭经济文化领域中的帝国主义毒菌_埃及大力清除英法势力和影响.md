　　Eliminating Imperialist Germs in the Economic and Cultural Fields
　　Egypt Vigorously Clears Out British and French Forces and Influence

Xinhua News Agency, 5th - Rome dispatch: According to an Associated Press reporter who recently arrived in Rome from Cairo, the Egyptian government is taking measures to eliminate British and French forces and influence in the economic and cultural fields in Egypt.

The report said that the Egyptian Ministry of Finance has appointed Egyptians to serve as managers of companies controlled by British and French individuals. Egyptian auditors have replaced British and French auditors in commercial firms. The profession of auditor was previously monopolized by British and French individuals, because British and French commercial firms feared that their secrets would be known by Egyptians.

The Deputy Minister of Education of Egypt, Nabil, told reporters that the Egyptian Ministry of Education is reviewing all British and French books and lecture notes currently used in schools and universities throughout Egypt. He said: "The current education policy must conform to the spirit of nationalism."

　  消灭经济文化领域中的帝国主义毒菌
　　埃及大力清除英法势力和影响
    新华社5日讯　罗马消息：据最近从开罗到达罗马的美联社记者报道，埃及政府正在采取措施以清除英法在埃及经济和文化领域内的势力和影响。
    报道说，埃及财政部已经任命埃及人来担任由英国人和法国人控制的公司的经理。埃及的查账员在商行里代替了英国籍和法国籍的查账员。查账员这个职业以前是被英国人和法国人垄断的，因为英法商行恐怕他们的秘密会被埃及人知道。
    埃及教育部副部长纳比尔对记者说，埃及教育部正在审查全埃及的学校和大学现在使用的一切英法书籍和讲义。他说：“现在的教育方针必须符合民族主义精神。”
