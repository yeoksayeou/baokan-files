Yunnan to Develop Forest Resources on a Large Scale

(Our newspaper Kunming, December 5th dispatch) Yunnan Province's abundant forest resources will soon be developed on a large scale. Yunnan Province has extremely rich forest resources and is one of the largest forest bases in the country. According to preliminary data from aerial surveys, the area covered by forests accounts for about 18% of the province's total area.

These forests are mostly concentrated in the basins of the Jinsha River, Lancang River, Nujiang River, Nanpan River, and Babian River. The main tree species include high-quality coniferous forests such as spruce, fir, hemlock, yew, Japanese cedar, Chinese torreya, keteleeria, juniper, cypress, prickly juniper, larch, Chinese white pine, and Yunnan pine, as well as precious broad-leaved trees such as nanmu, chestnut, birch, and camphor. In addition, there are special economic forests such as kapok, walnut, coconut, and tung trees.

These forest resources are extremely important and valuable materials for construction. For example, spruce and Chinese white pine are not only high-grade construction timber, but can also be used to manufacture high-quality paper, rayon, artificial wool, and materials for aviation and marine tools.

According to the plan, the original Yunnan Forest Industry Bureau has been renamed the Yunnan Forest Industry Administration, and several forest industry bureaus have been established separately. Soon, the felling, timber collection, transportation, and storage processes of these newly established forest industry bureaus will be basically mechanized.

Currently, the preparatory organization for developing the Jinsha River forest area is being prepared for establishment. At the same time, a pilot project for a complete mechanized workshop is underway in the Yunnan Panjiang forest area.

　　云南即将大规模开发森林资源
    本报昆明5日电　云南省丰富的森林资源，不久就要大规模地开发了。云南省蕴藏的森林资源极为丰富，是祖国最大的森林基地之一。据航空视察的初步资料，森林分布的面积约占全省总面积18％。
    这些森林大部分集中在金沙江、澜沧江、怒江、南盘江、把边江等流域；主要树类有云杉、冷杉、铁杉、红豆杉、柳杉、三尖杉、油杉、原柏、扁柏、刺柏、落叶松、华山松、云南松等高尚针叶林，还有楠木、栗木、桦木、香樟等珍贵的阔叶树，此外还有木棉、核桃、椰子、桐子等特种经济林。
    这些森林资源是建设中极其重要而宝贵的材料。例如云杉、华山松等不仅是高级的建筑用材，而且可以制造上等纸张、人造丝、人造毛和航空航海工具的材料。
    根据规划，原云南森林工业局已改为云南森林工业管理局，并分设若干森林工业局。不久，这些新建森林工业局的采伐、集材、运输、贮木等过程，基本上要实现机械化。
    现在，开发金沙江林区的筹备机构正在准备建立；同时，云南盘江林区正进行一个完整的机械化作业车间的试点工作。
