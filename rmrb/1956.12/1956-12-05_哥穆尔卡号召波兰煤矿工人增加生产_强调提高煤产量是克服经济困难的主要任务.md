Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 4th: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a speech at a meeting in Katowice on December 3rd to celebrate Miner's Day. He discussed Poland's economic situation, particularly the coal mining industry, and the tasks it faces.

　　Economic Difficulties Caused by Decreased Coal Exports
　　Gomułka said: In 1949, Polish miners mined 74.5 million tons of coal, of which 64% was used domestically and the remaining 36% was exported to other countries.
　　In 1955, the last year of the Six-Year Plan, 94.5 million tons of coal were produced, exceeding the 1949 output by more than 27%.
　　In 1955, coal exports reached 24.2 million tons, accounting for 26% of the total output, while 70.3 million tons met domestic needs, accounting for 74% of the total output. The proportion of coal used by industry and power stations accounted for the largest increase in total domestic coal consumption. This is a positive phenomenon because it means that industry and power stations have greatly expanded, and many new enterprises have been established.
　　Coal and coke accounted for 54.5% of the total export value in 1949, while in 1955, they accounted for 46.6% of the total export value.
　　Currently, the main difficulty in our national economy is caused by the reduction in our coal exports. The Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) stipulated that 24.5 million tons of coal should be exported in 1956. However, due to the increase in domestic coal consumption and a certain degree of decline in coal production, we can only export a maximum of 19.5 million tons this year. This shortfall cannot be compensated for by other consumer goods.
　　This shortfall of five million tons in coal exports this year has created a $100 million deficit in our foreign trade balance plan. The decline in exports of other commodities has greatly increased this deficit.
　　This decline in coal and other commodity exports has forced the government to reduce the planned investment amount. Preliminary cuts in this area have already been made in the middle of this year.

　　Total Wages Will Increase Significantly
　　Speaking on the issues of national income and the quantity of goods on the market, Gomułka said: In 1955, total wage expenditures amounted to 91.5 billion zlotys. It is estimated that the total wage bill will increase to approximately 106 billion zlotys this year. This means an increase of approximately 16%.
　　The total wage bill has increased particularly significantly in recent months. Compared with the same months in 1955, it increased by 18% in July this year; 21% in August; 22% in September; and 25% in October.
　　The increase in the total wage bill is partly due to the increase in the number of employees compared to last year, but mainly due to wage increases and other reasons, such as the increase in pensions for the elderly and those who have lost their ability to work, the resolution of certain outstanding demands of workers, and over-fulfillment of work quotas, etc.
　　In 1956, more than four million people had their wages increased. Approximately 2.8 million people did not have their wages increased.
　　Incomes in rural areas have also increased significantly. It is estimated that incomes in rural areas will increase by approximately 8 billion zlotys this year compared to last year.
　　Appropriately increasing the goods that we currently produce ourselves cannot fully offset this increased amount paid in cities and rural areas.

　　Difficult but Manageable Economic Prospects for Next Year
　　Gomułka said, so what are the economic prospects for 1957? In 1955, we still exported more than 24 million tons of coal, but in 1957, this figure will decrease by 10 million to 11 million tons. Therefore, due to the decrease in coal exports, our balance of payments in foreign trade will have an unfavorable decrease, a decrease of more than 200 million US dollars.
　　At the same time, in 1957, the total wage bill will continue to increase. Due to the wage increases this year, the normal wage payment increase caused by a certain increase in the number of employees and the over-fulfillment of work quotas, even if wages are not increased in 1957, the total wage bill will reach approximately 113 billion zlotys.
　　The government is currently facing the difficult task of how to solve the problem of supplying the market with additional goods equivalent to the increased purchasing power of the public.
　　Considering the substantial increase in the planned production of goods in 1957, we can already see today that if additional steps are not taken to fully meet the needs of the market, we will be short of goods worth approximately 13 billion to 14 billion zlotys.
　　We cannot produce the missing quantity of goods ourselves because, as I have already said, our exports, especially coal exports, are decreasing significantly. We must use foreign loans to cope with the lack of goods, or use imported consumer goods raw materials to produce goods in our own factories, or use such loans to purchase finished consumer goods from abroad.
　　The economic difficulties we are currently encountering are temporary in nature. 1957 will be the most difficult year. These difficulties are caused by many reasons. The most important reason is the disproportionate development of various industrial sectors and the development of the national economy during the Six-Year Plan, which has created difficulties in utilizing existing production capacity. Another serious difficulty is that the increase in coal production is very slow, or even has a certain degree of decline, and most importantly, coal exports have suddenly decreased.
　　There are now plans to ensure that the Five-Year Plan can eliminate these disproportionalities as quickly as possible and fully utilize the existing production capacity of our industry. The question of how to create conditions to increase coal production is the main concern of the government and the Party Central leadership today. We clearly see that without huge investments, huge investments much larger than those stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, we cannot significantly increase coal production. This is the most serious of all our difficulties and shortcomings.

　　Will Do Our Best to Meet the Just Demands of Miners
　　Gomułka then continued to say that despite the difficult economic situation, the guiding organs of the People's Government have recognized the need to, from January 1st next year, meet the just demands of miners to change the existing wage system, simplify the existing system according to the pre-war coal mine system, and appropriately increase basic wages.
　　Gomułka said that despite the current great difficulties, it is still necessary to stipulate in the currently planned mining wage regulations that the funds used for this purpose are more than in the past four years. This issue has already been discussed at a recent meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and it has been decided that new work and wage principles for the mining industry will be determined this month and implemented at the beginning of next year.
　　Gomułka then talked about stabilizing mining staff and increasing coal production in the near future.
　　He asked miners to voluntarily work on those holidays that have been prepared to be designated as workdays in the coal mining industry, strengthen labor discipline in coal mines, oppose incorrect attitudes towards technical supervisors and managers, and increase labor productivity.

　　哥穆尔卡号召波兰煤矿工人增加生产
    强调提高煤产量是克服经济困难的主要任务
    新华社华沙4日电　据波兰通讯社报道，波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡12月3日在卡托维兹庆祝矿工节的会上发表了演说，他谈到波兰的经济情况，特别是采煤工业的情况和面临的任务。
    煤出口量下降造成经济困难
    哥穆尔卡说：波兰矿工在1949年开采了七千四百五十万吨煤，其中64％是用在国内的，其余的36％是输出到其他国家的。
    在1955年，即在六年计划的最后一年，生产了九千四百五十万吨煤，比1949年的产量超过27％以上。
    1955年，出口的煤达二千四百二十万吨，占总产量的26％，满足国内需要的煤达七千零三十万吨，占总产量74％。工业和电力站用煤在国内用煤量的增加总量中所占的比重最大。这是一个积极的现象，因为这意味着工业和电力站大大扩大了，许多新企业建立起来了。
    煤和焦炭在1949年的出口总值中占54.5％，而在1955年，它占出口总值的46.6％。
    现在，我们国民经济的主要困难是我们的煤的出口量降低造成的。五年计划（1956—1960年）规定，1956年要输出二千四百五十万吨煤。然而，由于国内煤的消费量的增加以及煤产量的某种程度的下降，我们今年至多只能输出一千九百五十万吨。无法以别的消费品来抵补这一差额。
    今年煤的出口中所短少的这五百万吨给我们的对外贸易收支计划造成了一亿美元的差额。其他商品输出的下降，大大地增加了这个差额。
    煤炭和其他商品输出中的这种下降使政府不得不减少计划中的投资金额。这一方面的初步削减在今年年中已经进行了。
      工资总额将有显著增加
    在谈到国民收入以及市场上的商品数量这些问题时，哥穆尔卡说：1955年，工资支出总数达九百一十五亿兹罗提。据估计，工资总额今年大约将增加到一千零六十亿兹罗提。这就是说约增加16％。
    工资总额在最近几个月里有了特别显著的增加。和1955年同月份相比，今年7月份增加18％；8月份增加21％；9月份增加22％；10月份增加25％。
    工资总额的增加一部分是由于就业人数较去年增加，但主要是由于工资提高以及别的原因，比如对老年人和丧失劳动力的人的年金的增加，工人某些悬而未决的要求的解决，以及超额完成工作定额等等。
    在1956年，有四百多万人增加了工资。约有二百八十万人的工资没有增加。
    农村中的收入也大大增加了。据估计，今年农村中的收入将比去年增加约八十亿兹罗提。
    适当增加我们自己目前生产的货物，并不能完全抵销在城市和农村中付出的这笔增加了的款项。
  明年经济前景有困难但有办法
    哥穆尔卡说，那末1957年的经济情况的前景是怎样呢？在1955年，我们仍然出口了二千四百多万吨煤，但是在1957年，这个数字将减少一千万吨到一千一百万吨。因此，由于煤的出口的减少，我们对外贸易的支付平衡将有对我们不利的减少，将减少二亿多美元。
    同时，在1957年，工资总额将继续增加。由于今年增加了工资，由于就业人数的某种增加和超额完成工作定额所引起的正常的工资支付数目的增加，即使1957年不增加工资，工资总额也将达到约一千一百三十亿兹罗提。
    政府目前面临了这样一个困难的任务：怎样解决以价值相等于提高了的公众购买力的额外货物来供应市场的问题。
    考虑到在1957年计划中所规定的商品产量的大大增加，我们今天已经能够看出，如果不采取额外的步骤来充分满足市场的需要的话，我们就要缺少价值约一百三十亿到一百四十亿兹罗提的商品。
    我们不能由我们自己来生产所缺少的这个数量的货物，因为，正如我已经说过的，我们的出口，首先是煤的出口，正在大大减少。我们必须用外国的贷款来应付缺乏商品的情况，或者由我们自己的工厂用进口的消费品原料来生产商品，或者用这种贷款向国外购买制成的消费品。
    我们现在所遇到的经济困难是暂时性质的。1957年将是最困难的一年。这些困难是由于许多原因造成的。其中最重要的原因是六年计划期间出现的各个工业部门的发展和国民经济的发展不成比例，从而产生了利用已有的生产能力的困难。另一个严重困难是煤的产量增长得很慢，甚至产量有一定程度的下降，而最重要的是煤的出口突然下降。
    现在正打算使五年计划能够尽速消除这些不成比例的现象，并且充分利用我国工业现有的生产能力。关于如何创造条件使煤的产量能够增加的问题，是今天政府和党中央领导关心的主要问题。我们清楚地看到，没有巨额投资，比五年计划中所规定的大得多的巨额投资，我们便不能使煤的产量显著增加。这是我们所有困难和缺点中的最严重的一项。
    将尽力满足矿工的正当要求
    哥穆尔卡然后继续说，尽管经济情况困难，人民政府的指导机关已经认识到有必要从明年1月1日起，满足矿工提出的改变现有工资制度、按战前煤矿制度的方针简化现有制度以及适当提高基本工资这些正当的要求。
    哥穆尔卡说，尽管目前的困难很大，仍然有必要在现在计划中的矿业工资条例中规定用于这方面的经费比过去四年为多。这个问题已经在波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局最近举行的会议上加以讨论，已经决定，在本月内确定采矿工业的新的工作和工资原则，并在明年初开始实行。
    哥穆尔卡接着谈到了在最近的将来稳定矿业工作人员和增加煤产量的问题。
    他要求矿工在已经准备在采煤工业中定为工作日的那些假日自动工作，加强煤矿中的劳动纪律，反对对技术监督人员和管理人员采取不正确的态度，并且提高劳动生产率。
