    Please Do Not Adopt the "Isolation Education Method"
    Liǔ Ní
    Currently, corporal punishment in children's education is gradually decreasing. However, some kindergartens have created a new education method. This education method does not yet have a formal academic name, so let's tentatively call it the "Isolation Education Method."

    The so-called "Isolation Education Method" is when a child "disobeys," they are isolated, placed in a separate room (it would be more accurate to say confined to a separate room), to be alone in a room so that the child feels lonely and in pain, and will then become obedient. If it is a child who likes to cry, let them be alone, facing desks, chairs, and benches to cry, cry enough, cry until tired, and they will seek the "love" of the "aunties." If it is a child who likes to make trouble, let them be alone to make trouble, making trouble to the point of being covered in bruises, with a bruised and swollen face, and they will slowly calm down.

    Some people oppose this method. However, the people who created and promote this method say that it is to educate children with the spirit of collectivism, because when these children are alone in a room, tasting the pain of losing collective happiness, they will better appreciate the value of the collective, thereby learning from the collective and correcting their mistakes. Some people also say that "isolation" is to allow children who have made "mistakes" to "reflect." I don't understand pedagogy, but I think children are not "saints" or "sages," they are innocent and naive, and cannot distinguish right from wrong about the "mistakes" they have made, let alone have the ability of "reflective thinking."

    This "Isolation Education Method" is merely a disguised form of "corporal punishment education," the only difference being that it replaces corporal punishment with mental torture. I hope that teachers and aunties will patiently persuade and patiently talk to "disobedient" children, and stop using this "Isolation Education Method."

### 请勿采用“隔离教育法”

    请勿采用“隔离教育法”
    柳泥
    目前，在儿童教育中，体罚现象渐渐少了。但是，有的幼儿园却创造出一种新的教育方法。这种教育方法还没有正式学名，姑名之曰：“隔离教育法”。
    所谓“隔离教育法”，就是当某一儿童“不听话”的时候，便把他隔离开来，置之别室（说幽之别室更为恰当），让他单独的在一个房间里，孩子感到寂寞和痛苦了，就会听话。若是爱哭的孩子，让他单独一个人，对着桌椅、板凳去哭，哭够了，哭累了，他会去追求“阿姨”们的“爱”。若是爱闹的孩子，让他单独一个人去闹，闹来闹去，闹得遍体鳞伤，鼻青脸肿的时候，他会慢慢地安静下来。
    有的人反对这种方法。但是，创造和推行这种方法的人们却说，这是用集体主义精神教育儿童，因为当这些儿童单独一人在一个房间里，尝到失去集体幸福的痛苦的时候，他们便会更好地体会到集体的可贵，从而向集体学习，改正错误。也有人说，“隔离开来”是为了让犯“错误”的儿童“反省”。我不懂教育学，但是，我想儿童并非“圣”“贤”，他们天真烂缦，对自己所犯的“错误”还不能辨别是非，更谈不到有“反省思维”的能力。
    这种“隔离教育法”不过是变相的“体罚教育”，所不同的只不过以精神折磨代替体罚罢了。希望老师和阿姨们对“不听话”的孩子循循善诱和耐心说服，不要再用这种“隔离教育法”了。
