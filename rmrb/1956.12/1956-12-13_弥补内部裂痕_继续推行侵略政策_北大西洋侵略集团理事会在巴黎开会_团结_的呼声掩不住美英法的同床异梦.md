Xinhua News Agency, December 12th, Paris Dispatch: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, attended by representatives from fifteen countries, opened in Paris on the 11th.

The meeting was presided over by Italian Foreign Minister Martino. In his opening remarks, he urged the member states of the organization not to take any actions that might endanger "Atlantic unity," and said that now, more than ever, a "common Western policy" was needed, as only in this way could they "derive the greatest benefit" from the current world disputes.

After hearing the administrative report of NATO Secretary-General Ismay, the meeting moved into a restricted session. It is reported that this secret meeting examined the state of NATO, the world situation, and the so-called "intentions of Soviet policy." Those who spoke at the morning secret meeting included Dulles, Lloyd, Pineau, and Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange.

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th, Paris Dispatch: Amidst the calls for "maintaining Western unity" at the North Atlantic Group Council meeting, Western news reports continue to reveal the discord between the United States and Britain and France.

According to the United Press, Britain and France both hope to hold a US-British-French "Big Three conference" to "mend the alliance that is about to break down," but Dulles "avoids" this issue. Sources say that the United States will insist that policy negotiations with Britain and France be limited to the North Atlantic Alliance region. This is because "the Americans are unwilling to have any new overall Middle East plan, because the earlier participation of Britain and France" would arouse the resentment of Arab countries. According to a reporter from Cairo's "Al-Ahram," "Dulles has told Lloyd and Pineau that the United States intends to continue to pursue an 'independent' policy on many Middle East issues."

The "Al-Ahram" reporter pointed out that the most optimistic observers in Washington are already saying that "a great deal of effort" is still needed to achieve "unity." A senior American diplomatic official told this reporter: "It is widely expected that the final communique of the NATO and the three foreign ministers' talks will be full of words such as 'unity,' 'understanding,' and 'agreement,' but in fact, many problems will continue to remain unresolved."

    弥补内部裂痕　继续推行侵略政策
    北大西洋侵略集团理事会在巴黎开会
    “团结”的呼声掩不住美英法的同床异梦
    据新华社12日讯　巴黎消息：有十五国代表参加的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议，11日在巴黎开幕。
    会议由意大利外长马蒂诺主持。他致开幕词时，要求这个组织的成员国不要采取任何可能危及“大西洋团结”的行动，并且说，现在比以往任何时候都更需要一个“共同的西方政策”，只有这样才可以从当前的世界纠纷中“得到最大的利益”。
    会议在听取北大西洋公约组织的秘书长伊斯迈的行政报告之后，进入限制性的会议。据报道，这个秘密会议研究了北大西洋公约组织的状况、世界局势和所谓“苏联政策的意图”。在上午秘密会议中发言的有杜勒斯、劳埃德、比诺和挪威外交大臣兰格。
    据新华社12日讯　巴黎消息：在北大西洋集团理事会会议强调“保持西方团结”声中，西方的新闻报道继续传出美国和英法同床异梦的消息。
    据合众社报道：英国和法国都希望举行美英法“三巨头会议”，以“弥补那快要破裂的联盟”，但是杜勒斯却“避开”这个问题。有消息说：美国将坚持与英法的政策谈判只限于北大西洋联盟地区。因为“美国人不愿意任何新的总的中东计划，由于英法较早参加”，而引起阿拉伯国家的反感。据开罗“金字塔报”记者报道：“杜勒斯已经告诉劳埃德和比诺说，美国打算继续对许多中东问题采取‘独立’政策”。
    “金字塔报”记者指出，华盛顿最乐观的观察家已经在说：要实现“团结”，“还要作很大努力”。一个美国高级外交官员告诉这位记者说：“人们普遍预料，北大西洋公约组织和三国外长会谈的最后公报中将充满‘团结’、‘谅解’和‘协议’等辞汇，但是事实上，将有许多问题继续得不到解决。”
