Title: Han Dynasty Regime Severely打击 Slave Owners - Another Key Issue in the Ancient History Periodization Debate

    The Han dynasty in China's ancient society still partially used slaves for production, mainly in industrial and commercial operations such as iron smelting, salt boiling, and handicrafts. There are many examples that can be cited.

    Here, a question arises: Was the Han dynasty still a slave society?

    Some scholars in the Soviet Union and China answer this question affirmatively. They believe that both the Western and Eastern Han dynasties were still slave societies and maintain this position quite firmly.

    Regarding this viewpoint, I have expressed different opinions in "The Age of Slavery." I believe that the Han dynasties were no longer slave societies. In that article, I mentioned that slaves in the Han dynasty could not be killed without authorization; even princes and generals would be punished for killing slaves. I also raised such a question from an ideological perspective:

    "Emperor Wu of Han respected Confucianism and firmly established the superstructure of feudal morality on the basis of the landlord economy, laying the foundation for the standard feudal structure of the past two thousand years. Proponents of the Western Han slave system unconsciously encounter an unsolvable contradiction here. They acknowledge that Confucius and Confucianism are feudal theories, but they insist that the relations of production in the Western Han were still in the stage of slavery. Doesn't this mean that a feudal superstructure was erected on the foundation of a slave society?" ("The Age of Slavery," page 57)

    It has been almost five years since this question was raised, and I have yet to receive a satisfactory answer.

    Now, I would like to raise a new question for scholars at home and abroad who advocate that the Han dynasties were slave systems.

    It is true that industrialists and merchants in the Han dynasties still used slaves for production, and sometimes in considerable numbers. If we determine that the Han dynasties were slave systems based on these materials, then the Han dynasty regime should protect slave owners. However, on the contrary, the Han dynasty regime has cracked down on industrialists and merchants from the beginning, without interruption, and sometimes with severe, even fatal, blows. How should this be explained?

    The "Records of the Grand Historian, Treatise on the Equitable Standard" states: "After the world was pacified, Emperor Gaozu ordered that merchants not be allowed to wear silk or ride in carriages, and imposed heavy taxes to humiliate them. During the reigns of Emperor Hui and Empress Lü, the laws governing merchants were relaxed because the world had just been stabilized. However, the descendants of market vendors were still not allowed to serve as officials." This is an example of the Han dynasty regime cracking down on industrialists and merchants from the beginning.

    In the third year of Emperor Wu of Han's Yuanding reign (114 BC), a property tax was levied on wealthy merchants, using "minqian" (meaning a string of coins) as the unit, and adopting a self-reporting method to collect a certain amount of tax. Wealthy merchants who concealed or misrepresented their assets were allowed to be reported by the people, and the government would impose severe punishments and confiscate their property. As a result, "Yang Ke's denunciation of minqian spread throughout the country, and most families above the middle class were reported." Furthermore, "imperial censors, judicial officials, and supervisors were dispatched to various commanderies and kingdoms to investigate the minqian, obtaining immense amounts of property, tens of millions of slaves, and hundreds of qing of land in large counties and over a hundred qing in small counties. The houses were similar in scale, and most families above the middle class of merchants were ruined." (See "Records of the Grand Historian, Treatise on the Equitable Standard" and "Book of Han, Treatise on Food and Money.") This is an example of a severe crackdown.

    There are many such examples, and I will not list them one by one. But I want to repeat the new question I raised above: If the Han dynasty was a slave system, why did the Han dynasty government so severely crack down on industrialists and merchants who used slaves for production?

    In my opinion, this question may be another unsolvable contradiction for the Han dynasty slave system theory.

    But if we admit that the Han dynasty was already a feudal system, then this question can be easily resolved.

    That is, the Han dynasty's industry and commerce, which still used slaves for production, were merely remnants of the previous stage of slavery. This has irreconcilable contradictions with the regime built on the basis of feudal ownership. One of the regime's tasks was to eliminate these illegal remnants.

    Was the Han dynasty regime built on the basis of feudal ownership? In my opinion, this is not a problem. Not only in the Han dynasty, but as far back as the mid-Spring and Autumn period, the mainstream of ancient Chinese production – agriculture – had gradually entered the stage of feudal ownership.

    Just take the Qin and Han dynasties as an example. The words of Dong Zhongshu recorded in the "Book of Han, Treatise on Food and Money" are good evidence:

    "The Qin... used Shang Yang's laws, changed the system of emperors and kings, abolished the well-field system, and allowed the people to buy and sell land. The rich owned thousands of qing of land, while the poor had no land to stand on...

    Some cultivated the fields of wealthy people and paid taxes of ten-fifths...

    The Han dynasty followed this without change."

    This clearly indicates that land ownership in the Qin and Han dynasties was feudal, with the opposition between the landlord class and poor tenant farmers, and the land of the landlord class was already highly concentrated. The Qin and Han regimes were built on this foundation.

    The inscription on the Langya Platform of Emperor Qin Shihuang contains the following sentences:

    "The emperor's merit is diligence in fundamental affairs.
    Elevate agriculture and eliminate secondary occupations, enriching the common people."

    (See "Records of the Grand Historian, Basic Annals of Emperor Qin Shihuang")

    "Fundamental affairs" refers to agriculture, and "secondary occupations" refers to industry and commerce. This idea of prioritizing agriculture and devaluing commerce was the leading ideology of major schools of thought during the Zhou and Qin periods. The agriculturalists need not be mentioned (Note 1). The Legalists emphasized agriculture and warfare, and rejected secondary occupations (Note 2); the Confucians advocated sufficient food and soldiers, and prioritized righteousness over profit (Note 3). These are all reflections of the relations of production in the realm of ideology.

    The Qin dynasty's "elimination of secondary occupations" was not just empty talk. After unifying the world in the twenty-sixth year of Qin Shihuang, he "moved 120,000 households of wealthy people from all over the empire to Xianyang" (Records of the Grand Historian, Basic Annals of Emperor Qin Shihuang). This effectively deprived the "wealthy" of their property, which was equivalent to military service. In addition, there were also "wealthy" people who were moved to remote areas outside Xianyang. Please see the following items in the "Biographies of Money-Makers" in the Records of the Grand Historian:

    (1) "The ancestors of the Zhuo clan of Shu were from Zhao. They became wealthy through iron smelting; after Qin destroyed Zhao, they moved the Zhuo clan... to Linqiong."

    (2) "Cheng Zheng, a captive from Shandong, also engaged in smelting and casting... His wealth rivaled that of the Zhuo clan, and they both lived in Linyi."

    (3) "The ancestors of the Kong clan of Wan were from Liang and engaged in iron smelting. When Qin attacked Wei, they moved the Kong clan to Nanyang."

    The Zhuo, Cheng, and Kong clans were still industrialists and merchants who used slaves for iron smelting in the Han dynasty. It is conceivable that their family businesses before the Qin dynasty must have adopted the same mode of production. The Qin dynasty's relocation of them was not simply because they had lost their country but actually indicated that the Qin dynasty regime was cracking down on slave owners, which was tantamount to destroying the remnants of slavery.

    The Han dynasty regime inherited the Qin dynasty's system. The Qin and Han dynasties also continuously implemented the policy of protecting farmers and cracking down on slave-owner industrialists and merchants, and sometimes the Han dynasty executed it more thoroughly than the Qin dynasty.

    Scholars who advocate that the Han dynasties were slave systems disagree that agricultural production in the Han dynasty had abandoned the use of slaves. Instead, they believe that the Han dynasty still used slaves for agricultural production. There is some scattered evidence, such as Wang Bao's "Slave Contract," which mentions that slaves were engaged in farming. However, there are very few such examples. In addition, there are two examples that are often cited but misunderstood. I will cite them below and explain them.

    (1) As a result of Yang Ke's denunciation of minqian, "immense amounts of property were obtained, tens of millions of slaves, and hundreds of qing of land in large counties and over a hundred qing in small counties. The houses were similar in scale."

    (2) Zhongchang Tong's Changyan·Liluan: "Since the rise of the Han dynasty... the houses of the wealthy are connected by hundreds of beams, fertile fields fill the wilderness; thousands of slaves, tens of thousands of followers." (See Book of the Later Han·Biography of Zhongchang Tong)

    In these two examples, because the order of narration accidentally connects "slaves" with "land," proponents of the Han dynasty slave system believe that "slaves" were slaves who cultivated land, thus proving that the Han dynasties still used slaves for cultivation. This is incorrect.

    Please see the following two examples, where the order of narration of "slaves" and "land" is not connected.

    (1) Book of Han·Biography of Dong Zhongshu "With high position and great favor, a warm home and generous income… increasing their slaves, many their cattle and sheep, expanding their fields and houses, broadening their industries, and storing their accumulated wealth."

    (2) One example from the Juyan Han bamboo slips:

    "Houzhang·Lude·Guangchangli Gongcheng·Lizhong, age 30:
    Two small slaves, worth 30,000;
    One large slave woman, 20,000;
    One light carriage, worth 10,000;
    Five riding horses, worth 20,000;
    Two oxcarts, worth 4,000;
    Two oxen, 6,000;
    One residence, 10,000;
    Five qing of land, 50,000.
    Total assets, worth 150,000." (Note 4)

    (See Lao Gan: "Examination and Explanation of Juyan Han Bamboo Slips" page 455) It can be seen from this that there is no inevitable connection between "slaves" and "land." As for "thousands of slaves" in "Changyan" (meaning thousands in groups) corresponds to "hundreds of connected beams," and "tens of thousands of followers" corresponds to "fertile fields filling the wilderness." Slaves are domestic servants, and followers are serfs. Here, they should not be confused.

    As I understand it, the "slaves" in the Han dynasty generally did not engage in production. This was the case with official slaves, as well as private slaves of high-ranking officials and dignitaries.

    Book of Han·Biography of Gong Yu: "More than 100,000 slaves in various offices, idle and doing nothing, taxing the good people to provide for them, costing five or six million annually."

    It was good that they were "idle and doing nothing," some slaves relied on the power of the officials or their masters, bullying and dominating, and doing all kinds of evil. The household slaves of General Huo Guang are the best example. The Book of Han·Biography of Huo Guang records such an event. Huo Guang's household slaves and the household slaves of Imperial Censor Wei Xiang met on the road and refused to yield to each other, so they fought. "Huo's slaves entered the Imperial Censor's mansion, wanting to break down the Censor's door, the Imperial Censor had to kowtow and apologize (Note 5) before they left." Look at how fierce their arrogance was! In the Han dynasty's official system, the Grand General, the Chancellor, and the Imperial Censor were equal. The Imperial Censor of the Imperial Censor's office actually had to kowtow and apologize to the Grand General's household slaves! If the Grand General's household slaves were like this, the Imperial Censor or other officials' household slaves would inevitably be the same when they encountered unequal power.

    The head of Huo Guang's household slaves ("supervisor of slaves") was the famous Feng Zidu. The Biography of Huo Guang says that he was "loved and favored" by Huo Guang, and often relied on him to devise plans. Later, this "supervisor of slaves" also had an affair with Huo Guang's wife. He "repeatedly broke the law" and actually got to the point where Emperor Xuan of Han had to speak up, which shows how serious his "breaking the law" had become. The Han Yuefu "Yulin Lang" uses this Feng Zidu as its subject: "In the past, there was a slave in the Huo family, named Feng Zidu, who relied on the power of the general and teased the Hu girl in the wine shop." It is conceivable that teasing folk girls and insulting fraternal ethnic groups would be even more common. The Yuefu uses the words "pingting" to describe Zidu, which shows that this slave was indeed beautiful (Note 6). The utensils such as "silver saddle", "green canopy", "silk rope jade pot", "gold plate", and "bronze mirror" were all quite magnificent, simply like a luxurious young master. I believe that even if Xin Yan Nian, the author of the Yuefu, exaggerated somewhat, it would not be without basis.

    These are specimens of official and private slaves in the Han dynasty. Of course, there were exceptions, and the household slaves of Zhang Anshi, who was a contemporary of Huo Guang, were a notable exception.

    "Anshi was revered as a duke and marquis, with a fief of ten thousand households, but he wore yiti (Note 7), and his wife spun and weaved, and all 700 of his household servants had handicrafts to do; managing the family's industry, accumulating fibers; therefore, he was able to cultivate his wealth and was richer than Grand General Guang." (Book of Han·Biography of Zhang Anshi)

    This is to say that Zhang Anshi adopted the methods of merchants in the marketplace, using "household servants" to engage in the production of handicrafts. However, we should know that these "household servants with handicrafts to do," just like Zhang Anshi, who succeeded Huo Guang as Grand General, actually "wore yiti," and the Grand General's wife actually "spun and weaved," are completely narrated as exceptions. (Please note the word "ran" in the quotation.) There was only one frugal high-ranking official in the Han dynasty, Zhang Anshi, so it is possible that there were only those household servants of Zhang Anshi who "had handicrafts to do." We cannot treat such exceptions as common practice.

    I have raised the question above, and my views and explanations may be inappropriate. But if "slaves" are indeed related to land, and agriculture in the Han dynasty was indeed using slaves for production, I feel that the situation is even more serious. Because that would indicate that the Han dynasty regime consistently and severely cracked down on all slave owners. If that is the case, on what basis was this regime built? Was it a remnant of the primitive communal system? If so, after the Han dynasty regime was overthrown, there should have been a flourishing slave system regime in Chinese history. However, the development of Chinese history was not like that. Scholars and experts at home and abroad who advocate that the Han dynasties were slave systems also say that after the Han dynasty, Chinese society transformed into a feudal society. This, in my opinion, is really difficult to understand.

                                       December 2, 1956

    (Note 1) Most of the words of the pre-Qin agriculturalists have been lost, and only some remnants are preserved in "Lüshi Chunqiu" and "Guanzi." The four chapters of "Lüshi Chunqiu," "Shangnong," "Rendi," "Biantu," and "Shenshi," are particularly worthy of attention. They have a profound understanding of agricultural knowledge, and they narrate it in rhyme, which shows the spirit of scholars at that time who combined theory with practice. The "Shangnong" chapter begins by saying, "The reason why the ancient sage kings guided their people was to first focus on agriculture."

    (Note 2) For example, Han Feizi's "Guishi" chapter: "The reason why granaries are full is the fundamental task of farming, while embroidery is done by those who do not produce," he believes that this is a mistake. Also, the "Xianxue" chapter: "Now merchants, officials, artisans, and craftsmen also eat without cultivating, so the land is not cultivated, which is the same as a rock." There are many such examples, so they are not listed one by one.

    (Note 3) Confucius advocated sufficient food and soldiers (see "Analects"), and Mencius advocated prioritizing righteousness over profit (see "Mencius"). Also, there is also the saying in the "Analects" that "gentlemen understand righteousness, and petty people understand profit." These propositions all express the reflection of social production and are not simply ethical issues.

    (Note 4) This is an important Han dynasty property registration. "Houzhang" is the head of the scouts, Lude·Guangchangli is the place name, Gongcheng is the status, and Lizhong is the name of the person. The following eight items of property, plus a total of one item, a total of nine items, are divided into three horizontal rows in the original bamboo slips. Please note that the value of people is higher than horses and cattle.

    (Note 5) Among the subordinates of the Imperial Censor, there are several "Imperial Censors." The "Imperial Censor" who kowtowed and apologized here should not be the Imperial Censor. But the officials of the court had to kowtow to the "household slaves" of the superior officials, and the value of those slaves can be imagined.

    (Note 6) "Zidu" was a handsome man in ancient times. The Book of Poetry·Zheng Feng·Shan You Fusu "If you do not see Zidu, you will see a crazy man," Mao Zhuan "Zidu," "the most beautiful in the world." Mencius·Gaozi chapter "As for Zidu, the world knows that he is beautiful." Feng Zidu's name "Zidu" may be a nickname.

    (Note 7) Yan Shigu commented: "Yi, black color. Ti, thick silk." It can be translated as black thick cocoon silk.

    汉代政权严重打击奴隶主
    ——古代史分期争论中的又一关键性问题——
    郭沫渃
    我国的古代社会，发展到了汉代，依然局部地在使用奴隶从事生产，主要在冶铁、煮盐、工艺制作等工商业经营方面，这是有不少的事例可以引证的。
    在这里便发生着一个问题。那就是汉代是不是还是奴隶社会？
    苏联和中国的一部分学者，对于这个问题的答案是肯定的。他们认为西汉和东汉都还是奴隶社会，而且主张得相当坚决。
    对于这种看法，我在“奴隶制时代”中曾经提出过不同的见解。我认为，两汉已经不是奴隶社会。在那篇文章里面我曾经叙述到汉代的奴隶是不能擅自杀戮的，杀死了奴隶就是王侯将相都要坐罪；更曾经从意识形态上提出过这样一个质问：
    “汉武帝尊重儒家，在地主经济的基础之上，把封建道德的上层建筑牢固地建立了起来，奠定了两千多年来的标准的封建格局。西汉奴隶制说者在这里不自觉地碰着了一个无法解决的矛盾。他们承认孔子和儒家学说是封建理论，而却主张西汉的生产关系还在奴隶制的阶段，这岂不等于说：在奴隶制的社会基础之上树立了封建制的上层建筑吗？”（“奴隶制时代”57页）
    这个质问提出之后已经快要满五年了，我一直还没有得到一个可以满意的回答。
    现在我想再提出一个新的质问，请教于主张两汉是奴隶制的中外学者。
    两汉的工商业者的确还在使用奴隶从事生产，而且有时还是相当大量的使用。假使根据这些资料而断定两汉是奴隶制，那吗两汉的政权应该是保护奴隶主的。然而恰恰相反，两汉的政权从一开始就打击工商业者，一直没有间断，而且有时打击得十分沉重，可以说是致命的打击。这应该作怎样的解释呢？
    史记·平准书上说：“天下已平，高祖乃令贾人不得衣丝乘车，重租税以困辱之。孝惠、高后时，为天下初定，复弛商贾之律，然市井之子孙亦不得仕宦为吏。”这就是汉代政权一开始就打击工商业者的例证。
    汉武帝元鼎三年（元前114年）征收富商大贾的财产税，以“缗钱”（一串钱的意思）为单位，采取自报的办法，征收一定的税额。富商大贾有隐匿不报或报而不实的，允许人民告发，政府便处以严刑，并没收他们的财产。结果是“杨可告缗遍天下，中家以上大抵皆遇告。”又“分遣御史、廷尉、正监分曹，往往即治郡国缗钱，得民财物以亿计，奴婢以千万数，田大县数百顷，小县百余顷，宅亦如之，于是商贾中家以上大抵破。”（见史记·平准书和汉书·食货志。）这就是有时打击得十分沉重的例证。
    像这样的事例还有不少，我不想一一举出了。但我要重复我在上面提出的新质问：如果汉代是奴隶制，两汉的政府为什么那样严厉地打击使用奴隶从事生产的工商业者？
    这个问题，在我看来，对于两汉奴隶制说可能又是一个无法解决的矛盾。
    但如果承认汉代已经是封建制，那吗这个问题就可以迎刃而解了。
    那就是还在使用奴隶从事生产的汉代工商业只是前一阶段的奴隶制的残余。这和建立在封建所有制的基础上的政权是有着不能调和的矛盾。政权的任务之一也就是要消灭这些不合法度的残余。
    汉代的政权是不是建立在封建所有制的基础之上的呢？在我看来，这是不成问题的。不仅汉代，更远自春秋中叶以还，古代中国的生产主流——农业，早就逐步走上了封建所有制的阶段。
    单就秦汉两代来说吧。汉书·食货志所载董仲舒的话是很好的证据：
    “秦……用商鞅之法，改帝王之制，除井田，民得卖买。富者田连仟佰，贫者无立锥之地。……
    或耕豪民之田，见税什伍。……
    汉兴循而未改。”
    这明白地表示着秦汉两代的土地是封建所有制，有地主阶级和贫苦雇农的对立，地主阶级的土地已有大量的集中。秦汉的政权就是建立在这种基础之上的。
    秦始皇帝琅邪台刻石辞里面有这样的几句话：
    “皇帝之功，勤劳本事。
    上农除末，黔首是富”。
    （见史记·秦始皇本纪）
    “本事”就是农，“末”就是工商业。这种以农为本、以商为末的思想是周秦诸子中主要学派的主导思想。农家可不用说（注一）。法家的重耕战，斥末作（注二）；儒家的足食足兵，先义后利（注三），都是生产关系在意识形态上的反映。
    秦代“除末”倒并不是一句空话。秦始皇二十六年统一天下之后，即“徙天下豪富于咸阳十二万户”（史记·秦始皇本纪）。这样使“豪富”离开了自己的产业，事实上就等于充军。在这之外也还有被迁徙到咸阳以外的边远地区的“豪富”，请看史记·货殖列传的下列几项吧。
    （1）“蜀·卓氏之先，赵人也。用铁冶富；秦破 赵，迁卓氏，……致之临邛。”
    （2）“程郑，山东迁虏也，亦冶铸。……富埒卓 氏，俱居临印。”
    （3）“宛·孔氏之先，梁人也，用铁冶为业。秦 伐魏，迁孔氏南阳”。
    卓氏、程郑、孔氏，在汉代都还是一些使用奴隶从事铁冶的工商业家，可以想见他们在秦以前的家业也一定是采取着同样的生产方式的。秦代的迁徙他们，倒不单纯是因为亡了国，实际上是表明着秦代政权在打击奴隶所有主，也就是在摧毁奴隶制的残余。
    汉代的政权在体制上是承袭着秦代的，在保护农民、打击奴隶主工商业家的政策上秦汉两代也是蝉联着的，而且有时候汉代比秦代执行得更要彻底。
    主张两汉是奴隶制的学者们，他们不同意汉代的农业生产已经扬弃了使用奴隶的阶段，而是认为汉代依然在使用奴隶从事农业生产。零星的一些证据是有的，如王褒的“僮约”里面也就提到僮仆要从事耕作。但这样的例证为数极少。此外，有两项每被引用而是误解了的例子，我现在把它们引在下边，加以说明。
   （1）上举杨可告缗的结果，“得民财物以亿计，奴婢以千万数，田大县数百顷，小县百余顷，宅亦如之。”
   （2）仲长统昌言·理乱篇：“汉兴以来，……豪人之室，连栋数百，膏田满野；奴婢千群，徒附万计。”（见后汉书·仲长统传）
    这两例因为在叙述次第上“奴婢”偶然和“田”相连，于是两汉奴隶制说者便以为“奴婢”是耕田的奴隶，用以证明两汉仍然在使用奴隶耕作。这是不正确的。
    请看下列二例，“奴婢”与“田”的叙述次第便并不相连。
   （1）汉书·董仲舒传“身宠而载高位，家温而食厚禄，……众其奴婢，多其牛羊，广其田宅，博其产业，畜其积委。”
   （2）居延汉简中之一例：
    “候长·觻得·广昌里公乘·礼忠年卅：
    小奴二人，直（值）三万；
    大婢一人，二万；
    轺车一乘，直万；
    用马五匹，直二万；
    牛车二两（辆）直四千；
    服牛二，六千；
    宅一区，万；
    田五顷，五万。
    凡赀，直十五万。”（注四）
    （见劳榦：“居延汉简考释”455页）由此可见，“奴婢”与“田”相连并无一定的必然性。至于“昌言”里面的“奴婢千群”（以千为群之意）是和“连栋数百”相应，“徒附万计”是和“膏田满野”相应的。奴婢是家内奴役，徒附就是隶农。在这里是不应该混淆的。
    照我的了解，汉代的“奴婢”一般并不从事生产。官家奴婢是这样，大官大吏的私家奴婢也是这样。
    汉书·贡禹传：“诸官奴婢十万余人，戏游无事，税良民以给之“岁费五六钜万。”
    这样“戏游无事”的倒还是好的，有的奴婢更倚仗官势或主势，豪强霸道，无恶不作。大将军霍光的家奴就是最好的例证。汉书·霍光传纪载着这样的事件。霍光的家奴和御史大夫魏相的家奴在路上相遇，互不相让，于是便争斗起来。“霍氏奴入御史府，欲躢大夫门，御史为叩头谢（注五），乃去。”请看，这是多么凶猛的气焰！汉朝的官制，大将军、丞相、御史大夫是平等的。御史府的御史竟要向大将军的家奴叩头谢罪！大将军的家奴是这样，御史大夫或其他官吏的家奴遇到势力不对等的必然也会是同样。
    霍光家奴的头子（“监奴”）是有名的冯子都。霍光传上说他为霍光所“爱幸”，常常靠着他想方设计。后来这位“监奴”又和霍光夫人私通。他“数犯法”，竟闹到汉宣帝也出来说话的地步，可见他的“犯法”到了怎样严重的程度。汉乐府
  “羽林郎”就是以这冯子都为题材的：“昔有霍家奴，姓冯名子都，依倚将军势，调笑酒家胡”。这样调戏民间少女、侮辱兄弟民族，想来更会是家常茶饭的了。乐府中用“娉婷”两字来形容子都，可见这位家奴的确美貌（注六）。“银鞍”、“翠盖”、“丝绳玉壶”、“金盘”、“青铜镜”，用具都是相当煊赫的，简直像一个豪华公子。我相信，作乐府的辛延年即使有些夸张，但也不会是毫无根据的。
    这些就是汉代官私奴婢的标本。当然也有例外存在，和霍光同时的张安世的家奴就是一个显著的例外。
    “安世尊为公侯，食邑万户，然身衣弋绨（注七），夫人自纺绩，家童七百人皆有手技作事；内治产业，累积纤维；是以能殖其货，富于大将军光”。（汉书·张安世传）
    这是说张安世采取了市井商贾的办法，以“家僮”从事手工艺品的生产。但是，这些“有手技作事”的家僮，我们要知道，就和继霍光之后而为大将军的张安世居然“身衣弋绨”，大将军夫人居然“自纺绩”一样，完全是作为例外事而被叙述着的。（请注意引文中的一个“然”字。）汉代的勤俭高官只有这么一个张安世，那吗，“有手技作事”的高官家僮可能也就只有这些张安世的家僮。我们不能把这样的例外事作为常例看待。
    以上我把问题提出了，我的见解和解释可能不妥当。但如果“奴婢”确实是和田地相关联，汉代的农业确实是在使用奴隶从事生产，我觉得那情形就更为严重。因为，那样是表明汉代政权一贯地严重打击整个奴隶所有主。如果是那样，这个政权到底是建立在什么基础之上的呢？它是原始公社制的残余吗？那吗，汉代政权被推翻了之后，在中国历史上就应该出现一个鼎盛的奴隶制政权。然而中国的历史发展不是那样。主张两汉是奴隶制的中外学者专家们也说在汉代以后，中国社会就转变为封建社会了。这，在我看来，实在是很不容易理解的。
                                       1956年12月2日
    （注一）先秦农家者言绝大部分已经丧失，仅仅在“吕氏春秋”和“管子”里面保留着一些残余。“吕氏春秋”的“上农”、“任地”、“辨土”、“审时”四篇是值得特别重视的，对于农业知识有很深刻的了解，而且把它用韵文叙述了出来，足见当时学者们联系实际的治学精神。“上农”篇一开始就说“古先圣王之所以导其民者，先务于农”。
    （注二）例如韩非子“诡使”篇；“仓廪之所以实者耕农之本务也，而綦组锦绣刻画为末作者富”，他认为这就是错误。又“显学”篇：“今商官技艺之士亦不垦而食，是地不垦，与磐石一贯也”。此类例证甚多，不备举。
    （注三）孔子主张足食足兵（见“论语”），孟子主张先义后利（见“孟子”）。又“论语”里面也有“君子喻于义，小人喻于利”的话。这些主张都表示着社会生产的反映，不单纯是伦理问题。
    （注四）这是一条值得重视的汉代财产登记。“候长”是斥候之长，觻得·广昌里是地名，公乘是身份，礼忠是人名。下列八项财产，加上一项合计，共九项，在原简中是分成三排横列的。请注意，人的价值是高于马牛了。
    （注五）御史大夫的下属中有若干“御史”，这儿叩头谢罪的“御史”应该不是御史大夫。但朝廷的命官要向上级官的“家奴”叩头，那些奴才的身价也就可以想见了。
    （注六）“子都”是古时候的一个美男子。诗·郑风·山有扶苏“不见子都，乃见狂且”，毛传“子都”，“世之美好者也”。孟子·告子篇“至于子都，天下莫不知其姣也”。冯子都取名“子都”，可能是一个绰号。
    （注七）颜师古注：“弋、黑色也。绨、厚缯也”。可以译为黑色的厚茧绸。
