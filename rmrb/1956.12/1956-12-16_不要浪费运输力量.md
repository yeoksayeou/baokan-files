Don't Waste Transportation Capacity
By our reporter Zhang Jing

　　The dry season in the ice-bound port of Binghe, Jiangsu Province, is about to begin. At the Zhenjiang wharf, which is responsible for the transshipment of goods between the north and south, and at wharves along the canal, large quantities of goods are piling up and cannot be shipped out. There is grain bound for disaster areas, coal to supply the people for the winter, and basic construction materials such as stone and bricks… Many places are eagerly awaiting these materials. Many lime kilns in the Suzhou area have reduced production or stopped work because they cannot get the stone shipped from Xishan. The demand for lime in various places is also becoming strained. According to November statistics, the actual amount of goods now backlogged at the wharves and shipping units awaiting transport is at least 200,000 tons. However, the canal water flows by, and time slips away; the goods cannot automatically move to the places where they are needed! This is because there are not enough transportation tools to serve them!

　　The lack of transportation tools is undoubtedly a difficult problem to solve in the short term, but at this critical juncture, the waste of transportation capacity is still constantly occurring.

　　People have long known that the two-way transportation of the same type of goods is a waste in itself, but so far, no way has been found to eliminate this phenomenon, which further increases the tension in transportation. Take the transport of bricks and tiles, for example. Once the fourth quarter arrives, basic construction units in various places are busy purchasing bricks and tiles, and they are desperate, as long as they can buy them anywhere. Thus, at the same time, Nantong, north of the Yangtze River, runs to Changshu, south of the Yangtze River, to transport bricks, while Shanghai in the south of the Yangtze happens to run to Qidong on the opposite bank to buy bricks and tiles. The same bricks and tiles are transported back and forth on the same route in both directions. It looks very tense, but isn't it a big waste? Why can't the relevant departments coordinate and manage it uniformly?

　　When tools are insufficient and transportation is busy, shortening the turnaround time of ships and increasing the number of voyages can fully utilize the potential of transportation. Of course, this requires the cooperation of transportation departments, receiving units, and loading and unloading wharves. However, some receiving units, only considering their own convenience and regardless of how tense the transportation is, always follow an old system and old habits. They come to work and leave work, and the procedures for submitting orders and testing are numerous. They would rather have the ship wait for the people than have the people adapt to the ship. Once, the 038 fleet of the Zhenjiang Shipping Bureau was to carry 10,960 bags of flour to other places, but just as the ship was being loaded, the Grain Bureau's closing time arrived. Although it would have taken only another twenty minutes to complete the loading, the comrades of the Shipping Bureau repeatedly requested to continue loading, but the comrades of the Grain Bureau consistently refused. As a result, in order to "resolutely implement the office system," they had to stop loading the ship.

　　Of course, it is entirely necessary to stipulate certain systems in loading and unloading, but the system itself is for the convenience of work. When the working environment and objective situation change, the system must also change, otherwise it will cause losses to the work. In fact, some systems and procedures, if determined to change, can save a lot of transport capacity. Wuxi City recently simplified the consignment procedures and abolished some unnecessary testing processes in the city's collection and transportation, which freed up a lot of transport capacity at once. In the past, it could only turn around 24 times a day, but now the highest can turn around 45 times, increasing efficiency by 87.5%. What a convincing comparison!

　　Poor communication between the transport and receiving parties often prolongs the loading and unloading time. Once, four fleets of the Zhenjiang Shipping Administration Bureau transported wheat seeds to Xuyi County. Due to insufficient preparation by the County Grain Bureau and the small bulk grain depot in the unloading work, and insufficient communication between the fleets and the grain station, the four fleets lost a total of 11,490 ton-days due to waiting for unloading, which could have completed three voyages of 1,536 tons from Zhenjiang to Qingjiang.

　　Now, time is even more precious! Man-made waste is completely possible to be prevented by subjective efforts. I hope that those departments in charge of this work, whether it is the transportation department, the consigning unit, or the receiving unit, will care about fully utilizing the power of existing transportation tools to transport materials out quickly.

    不要浪费运输力量
    本报记者　张竞
    江苏省冰河冻港的枯水季节就要开始了。担负着南北物资中转任务的镇江码头和运河沿线的各个码头上，还堆积着大批的物资运不出去。这里有运往灾区的粮食，有供应人民过冬的煤炭，有石料、砖瓦等基本建设材料……许多地方望眼欲穿地等待着这些物资。苏州专区的许多石灰窑，因为等不到西山运来的石料，已经减产、停工。各地需要的石灰也跟着紧张起来。据11月份统计，现在实际积压在码头和托运单位待运的物资，至少在二十万吨以上。可是，运河的水流过去了，时间滑过去了，物资不可能自动跑到需要它的地方去！因为没有足够的运输工具来为它们服务！
    运输工具不够，固然是客观上一时难以解决的困难，可是，在这紧张的关头，还在不断发生着浪费运输力量的事情。
    人们早就知道，同类物资的对流运输，本身就是一种浪费，但至今还没有能设法消除这种现象，因而更加增添了运输上的紧张。就说砖瓦的运输吧。第四季度一到，各地基本建设单位忙着选购砖瓦，便不顾一切，只要哪里能买到就行。于是，在同一时期，长江以北的南通，跑到长江以南的常熟去运砖，而江南的上海又偏偏跑到对江的启东去买砖瓦，同样的砖瓦，却在一条航线上南北对流运来运去。看起来很紧张，实际上岂不是很大的浪费，为什么有关部门不能统一的调度和管理一下呢？
    在工具不够、运输繁忙的时候，尽量缩短船舶周转期，增加航次，就能够把运输的潜力充分发挥起来。当然，这需要运输部门、收货单位和装卸码头的通力合作。但偏偏有些收货单位，只图他们自己方便，不管运输怎么紧张，他们总是因循着一套旧制度、旧习惯，上班到，下班走，递单、化验等等，手续繁多，宁可船等人，不愿人就船。有一次，镇江航运局的○三八船队，要承载一万零九百六十包面粉运往外地，不料正在装船时，粮食局的下班时间到了，虽然再有二十分钟就可装完，航运局的同志再三请求继续装下去，但是，粮食局的同志始终没有同意。结果，为了“坚决执行办公制度”，只好停止装船。
    当然，在装卸方面规定一定的制度，是完全必要的，但制度本身是为便利工作而服务的，当着工作环境和客观情况发生变化时，制度也必须跟着改变，否则就会使工作遭到损失。事实上，有些制度、手续，如果决心改变一下，就可以节省很大的运力。无锡市最近在市内收运方面，因为简化了托运手续，废除了一些不必要的化验过程，一下就腾出很大的运力，以往每日只能周转二十四次，现在最高的已可周转四十五次，提高效率87.5％。这是一个多么有说服力的对比！
    运、收双方联系得不好，常常会延长装卸的时间，有一次镇江航管局的四个船队往盱眙县运麦种，由于县粮局和小堆头粮库在卸货工作上准备不充分，船队和粮站双方之间联系不够，四个船队因为停船待卸，共损失了一万一千四百九十吨天，可完成镇江到清江三个航次一千五百三十六吨。
    现在，时间更加宝贵了！人为的浪费是完全可能用主观的努力来制止的。希望那些主管这份工作的部门，不论是运输部门，不论是托运单位或收货单位，都来关心充分利用现有运输工具的力量，把物资迅速运出去吧。
