Director Su, the Frugal and Simple

    In the Shenyang Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau, people always say that Director Su Jian is a consistently frugal and simple person. He is unpretentious, doesn't care about ostentation, and still maintains the hard-working and simple style of the difficult war years.
    Once, Director Su and the construction company manager and an engineer went to a remote construction site to inspect the work. The road was full of water, and the car couldn't pass. What should they do? Director Su didn't say a word, waded through the water, and the engineer and manager, seeing this, also rolled up their trousers and followed him to the construction site.
    Another time, the bureau had seven or eight thousand basic construction workers preparing for winter training, but the houses built for these construction workers were not yet completed. The workers' housing was poor, and their morale was not very stable. At this time, Director Su brought a thin quilt and squeezed onto a bed made of planks with the workers. While living with the workers, he patiently educated them, encouraging them to overcome their temporary difficulties. Half a month later, the houses and heating were repaired, and he returned to his own dormitory.
    Su Jian's life is also very frugal and simple. Comrades in the bureau all know that Director Su has several sets of clothes: two sets of washed-out uniforms for summer, and a green cotton-padded jacket that he replaces every three years for winter. He often eats sorghum and mung bean rice mixed with tofu. Everyone admires his simple food and clothing.
    Su Jian's frugality is not for saving money. He has no savings. Apart from subscribing to some newspapers and magazines, most of the remaining money is used to help those with financial difficulties. In the first two years, when he was still on the supply system, there was not a single personal expense on his account. He is also meticulous about some details in life. When the supply system was implemented, the bottom of his washbasin leaked. He could have gotten a new one, but he didn't. He replaced the bottom and continued to use it. The public gave him a tin kettle, and he was always afraid that the bottom of the kettle would be damaged by water, so he emptied the water and turned it upside down every day before going to work.
    Such a thrifty life has long been a habit for him. During the difficult years of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, he often saved菜金,粮食 and gave them to sick comrades; during guerrilla warfare, he endured the pain of his injured leg and let women comrades with children ride the horse. He often washes his own clothes and mends his socks.
    The comrades in the bureau admire him for always maintaining this excellent style. Everyone said: Director Su is truly thrifty to the extreme. However, he always humbly said: "What is this thrift compared to the much more comfortable times than in the previous war years?"

    勤俭朴素的苏局长
    在沈阳市建筑工程局里，人们一谈起苏简来，都说他是一个一贯勤俭朴素的局长。他没有架子，不讲排场，至今保持着战争艰苦年代那种艰苦朴素的作风。
    有一次，苏局长和建筑公司经理、工程师到一个偏僻的工地去检查工作，路上积满了水，车过不去，怎么办呢？苏局长一句话没有说，淌着水就过去了，工程师和经理一看，也都挽起裤腿跟着到了工地。
    还有一次，局里有七、八千基本建设工人准备冬训，可是为这些建筑工人修的房子还没有完工，大家住的房子不好，情绪不很稳定。就在这个时候，苏局长挟了一床薄被和工人们挤在一个用跳板搭的床铺上睡觉。在同工人相处中，他耐心地向工人进行教育，勉励他们克服暂时的困难，半月以后，房子和暖气都修好了，他才回到自己的宿舍去住。
    苏简的生活也非常艰苦朴素。局里的同志都知道苏局长有几套衣服：夏天有两套洗得发白的制服，冬天有三年换一回面的青棉袄。他经常吃高粱小豆饭拌豆腐。大家看他粗茶淡饭、穿装打扮，都很佩服。
    苏简这样省吃俭用并不是为了攒钱，他并没有什么积蓄，除了订一些报刊、杂志外，剩下的钱大部都用在帮助生活较困难的人。头两年，当他还是供给制的时候，帐上没有一笔是他个人的开支。一些生活上的细节他也不苟且。在实行供给制的时候，洗脸盆的底子漏了，他本来可以领个新的，可是他没有领，换了个底又继续使用。公家给他个白铁壶，他总怕被水沤坏了壶底，每天上班前都把水倒尽倒放着。
    这样俭朴的生活对他来说是早已习惯了，在抗日战争和解放战争艰苦的年月里，他常常把菜金、粮食节省下来给有病的同志们；在打游击战的时候，他忍受着受伤的腿的疼痛，把马让给带孩子的女同志骑。他常常自己洗衣服，补袜子。
    局里的同志都很佩服他始终保持这种优良的作风，大家说：苏局长可真俭朴到家了。可是，他自己总是谦虚地说：“这算什么俭朴，比起以前战争时期来舒服得多了。”
