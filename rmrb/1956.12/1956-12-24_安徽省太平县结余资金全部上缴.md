    Anhui Province's Taiping County Surrenders All Surplus Funds
    (Reported by this newspaper) The leading organs of Taiping County, Anhui Province, responded to the call for increased production and thrift by taking the lead in handing over their surplus funds to the state.
    This year, in addition to the 12,000 yuan of housing construction funds allocated to Taiping County by the Anhui Provincial People's Committee, the county's leading organs also took out 36,000 yuan from surplus funds to build dormitories for cadres. After receiving the "Instructions on Controlling Financial Expenditure and Saving Administrative Expenses" jointly issued by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, the Taiping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the County People's Committee immediately stopped the construction of houses and transferred the second batch of housing construction materials that had been purchased to the first batch of projects that were not yet completed, and handed over the surplus funds of 13,000 yuan to the state. Under the influence of the leading organs, other organs in the county also reduced some non-productive expenditures.

    安徽省太平县结余资金全部上缴
    本报讯　安徽省太平县的领导机关响应增产节约号召，带头把结余的钱上缴给国家。
    今年，除安徽省人民委员会拨给太平县一万二千元房屋修建费以外，该县领导机关又从结余的款项中拿出三万六千元修建干部宿舍。中共太平县委会和县人民委员会在接到省委和省人民委员会联合发出的“控制财政支出，节约行政经费”的指示后，立即停止了房屋建筑，并且把已经买来的第二批房屋建筑材料转交给第一批尚未完工的工程用，把结余的一万三千元资金上缴给国家。在领导机关的影响下，该县其他机关也削减了一些非生产性的开支。
