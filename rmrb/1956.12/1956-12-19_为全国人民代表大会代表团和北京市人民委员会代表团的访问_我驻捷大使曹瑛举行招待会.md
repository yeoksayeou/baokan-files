Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 18th. Ambassador Cao Ying of China to Czechoslovakia held a reception on the evening of December 17 for the visit of the Chinese National People's Congress Delegation and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee Delegation to Czechoslovakia.

    Among those present at the reception were Czechoslovak President Zapotocky, Prime Minister Siroky, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Novotny, Chairman of the National Assembly Fierlinger, other leaders of the Party and government, Prague Mayor Svoboda, government ministers, senior military generals, members of the National Assembly, and well-known figures from all walks of life.

    Also present at the reception were diplomatic envoys of many countries to Czechoslovakia and foreign journalists.

    Ambassador Cao Ying delivered a speech at the reception. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the warm reception given to the Chinese delegation by the Czechoslovak people, the Communist Party, and government leaders during their visit to Czechoslovakia.

    Subsequently, delegation leader Peng Zhen and Chairman Fierlinger spoke at the reception.

    In his speech, Peng Zhen first expressed his reluctance to part with the Czechoslovak comrades and his heartfelt gratitude.

    Peng Zhen then said that Czechoslovakia is a strong fortress of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp, and a highly technical industrial country. We have personally seen the Lenin Factory in Pilsen, the steel factory in Ostrava, and other factories, which are large in scale and have new technological achievements. During our visit, we saw that your factories are manufacturing some machines for China, which demonstrates the fraternal help and deep friendship of the Czechoslovak people towards the Chinese people.

    During our visit, we also saw that on the basis of increasing production and improving labor productivity, you are gradually improving the living standards of the working people. The per capita consumption has increased by an average of 20% from 1953 to 1955, and another 7% this year. Your cultural and artistic achievements are also great. We were deeply impressed by your various achievements in socialist construction and congratulate you.

    Peng Zhen said that your entire nation is united, the Czech nation, the Slovak nation, and other nationalities are united. Unity is strength. The Chinese people deeply realize that the internal unity of our socialist countries and the unity between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are important guarantees for us to carry out socialist construction and safeguard world peace. The imperialists particularly dislike our great achievements and solid unity. They have never given up their conspiracies to carry out subversive activities in socialist countries, and have never relaxed their destruction of the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and their oppression of weak countries and nations. In the Near East, the imperialists launched a bloody war of aggression against Egypt's independence. Although they have now been defeated, they have not stopped their aggression against Egypt, Algeria, Cyprus, and other places. In Eastern Europe, imperialists and reactionaries concentrated their efforts on the Hungarian issue, attempting to continue to exploit the situation in Hungary to create a breach in the socialist camp. When their conspiracy failed, they frantically launched anti-Soviet and anti-communist clamors in Western countries. At this time, we are very pleased to see that Czechoslovakia has taken a firm stand on the Hungarian issue, supporting the revolutionary forces in Hungary, safeguarding the socialist system in Hungary, and supporting the Soviet Union's assistance to socialist Hungary. This is not only in the interests of the Hungarian and Czechoslovak people, but also in the interests of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world. We express our admiration for this.

    Peng Zhen finally said, comrades, our visit is coming to an end. At this moment of parting, what is particularly unforgettable for us is the deep friendship of the Czechoslovak people towards the Chinese people. We came carrying friendship and return loaded with friendship. The friendship between the Chinese and Czech people is eternal and unbreakable. Through this visit, we have learned many advanced experiences, and at the same time gained a deeper understanding of Czechoslovakia, so we will be able to cooperate more closely.

    In his speech, Fierlinger expressed his great appreciation for the visit of the Chinese delegation to Czechoslovakia. He said, "We know that the delegation includes patriotic and democratic figures from all aspects of China. We are very pleased to see the friendly attitude that all members of the delegation held when they came into contact with our workers, farmers, and people of other classes."

    Fierlinger said, "I belong to the older generation. I still remember how sympathetic I was to the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression when I was young. Now the Chinese revolution has achieved final victory and has developed very rapidly. We are paying great attention to the great achievements China has made in economic and cultural construction."

    "Today, at the symposium of the National Assembly, I said that the most important thing for a country is not the amount of steel and coal per capita, but the spirit of the people of this country, the leadership of this country, and the continuous progress of this country and its people. And the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are advancing at a rapid pace in the broad united front."

    Fierlinger continued, "China was very far away to us in the past. Today it is very close to us. This is because we have common ideas." He asked the delegation to convey the sincere greetings of the Czechoslovak people to the Chinese people, and to tell the Chinese people that Czechoslovakia will always be a strong member of our camp, and we will always be loyal friends and allies of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is precisely the bridge that closely connects our two countries.

    Fierlinger emphasized that the strength of socialism is great and invincible. However, we do not want to use this force to provoke war, we want to use this force to serve the cause of peace. This peace is based on Leninism, and is based on the principles of independence, freedom, and respect for the sovereignty of every country and nation. Because only when a nation respects other nations is it itself a free nation. Today, we are helping the Hungarian people, that is, supporting the independence and freedom of the Hungarian people.

    When Prague Mayor Svoboda spoke, he asked the Chinese guests to bring the respect of the working people of Prague to the working people of Beijing.

    At the reception, Czechoslovak Party and government leaders also had long and cordial conversations with the heads of the delegation. The atmosphere was very friendly and harmonious.

    为全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团的访问
    我驻捷大使曹瑛举行招待会
    新华社布拉格18日电　中国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使曹瑛12月17日晚间为中国全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团访问捷克斯洛伐克举行了招待会。
    出席招待会的有捷克斯洛伐克总统萨波托斯基、总理西罗基、捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记诺沃提尼、国民议会主席费林格，党和政府的其他领导人，布拉格市长斯沃波达，政府部长们，军队高级将领们，国民议会的议员们以及社会各界著名人士。
    出席招待会的还有许多国家驻捷克斯洛伐克的外交使节和外国记者们。
    曹瑛大使在会上首先致词。他对于中国代表团在捷克斯洛伐克访问期间受到捷克斯洛伐克人民、共产党和政府领导人的亲切接待表示衷心的感谢。
    接着，代表团团长彭真和费林格主席相继在会上讲话。
    彭真在讲话中首先向捷克斯洛伐克的同志们表示惜别之情和衷心的感谢。
    彭真接着说，捷克斯洛伐克是和平民主社会主义阵营的一个坚强堡垒，是一个具有高度技术的工业国家。我们亲眼看到比尔森的列宁工厂、俄斯特拉发的钢铁工厂和其他的工厂，规模宏大而且有着新的技术成就。在访问中我们看到你们的工厂正在为中国制造一些机器，这表现出捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国人民兄弟般的帮助和深厚的友谊。
    在我们访问中也看到你们在增加生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上，正在逐步提高劳动人民的生活水平，每个人的消费量从1953年到1955年已经平均增加了20％，今年又增加7％。你们的文化艺术成就也是很大的。我们对你们在社会主义建设的各种成就获得了深刻的印象，并对你们表示祝贺。
      彭真说，你们全国人民是团结的，捷克民族、斯洛伐克民族和其它民族是团结的。团结就是力量。中国人民深切地体会到，我们社会主义各国内部的团结和以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间的团结，是我们进行社会主义建设和维护世界和平的重要保障。帝国主义者是特别不喜欢我们的伟大成就和坚固的团结的。他们从来没有放弃过在社会主义国家中进行颠复活动的阴谋，从来没有放松过对于以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结的破坏和对于弱小国家和民族的压迫。在近东，帝国主义发起了反对埃及独立的血腥的侵略战争，虽然现在已经遭受了失败，但是，并没有停止对埃及、阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯和其它地方的侵略。在东欧，帝国主义者和反动派在匈牙利问题上集中他们的努力，企图继续利用匈牙利的形势把社会主义阵营打开缺口。当他们的阴谋失败的时候，他们就在西方国家内疯狂地发动了反苏、反共的叫嚣。在这时候，我们很高兴的看到捷克斯洛伐克在匈牙利问题上完全采取了坚决的立场，支持匈牙利的革命势力，维护匈牙利的社会主义制度，支持苏联对于社会主义匈牙利的援助。这不仅是符合匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克人民的利益，也是符合中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的利益的。我们对此表示钦佩。
    彭真最后说，同志们，我们的访问就要结束了，在这临别的时候，使我们特别难忘的是捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国人民深厚的友谊。我们是携带友谊而来，也满载着友谊而归。中捷两国人民的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的。通过这一次访问，我们学习了许多先进经验，同时对捷克斯洛伐克有了更深刻的了解，因而也就能够更亲密的合作。
    费林格在讲话中表示十分珍视中国代表团到捷克斯洛伐克访问。他说，我们知道代表团中包括了中国各个方面的爱国民主人士，我们很高兴地看到代表团的所有成员同我们工人、农民以及其他阶层人民接触的时候抱着多么友好的态度。
    费林格说，我是属于老一代的人，我还记得在年青的时候曾经怀着多么大的同情来看待中国人民的反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。现在中国革命已经取得最后胜利，而且有了非常迅速的发展。我们以很大的注意关注着中国在经济和文化建设等方面取得的伟大成就。
    今天，我在国民议会的座谈会上曾经说过一个国家最主要的还不在于按人口平均有多少钢、多少煤，而在于这个国家人民的精神，在于这个国家的领导，在于这个国家和人民不断向前进。而中国人民在中国共产党领导下，在广大的统一战线中正以飞快的速度在前进。
    费林格接着说，中国在过去对我们来说是很远的。今天对我们却很亲近。这是因为我们有共同的思想。他要求代表团把捷克斯洛伐克人民衷心的诚挚的致意转达给中国人民，并且告诉中国人民，捷克斯洛伐克将永远是我们阵营中的坚强的一员，我们将永远是苏联的忠实的朋友和同盟者，苏联正是把我们两国紧密联结在一起的桥梁。
    费林格强调说，社会主义的力量是伟大的、不可征服的。但是，我们不想用这种力量挑起战争，我们想用这种力量服务于和平主张。这种和平是建立在列宁主义基础上的，是在独立、自由、尊重每个国家和民族的主权的原则之上的。因为只有一个民族尊重别的民族时它自己才是自由的民族。今天，我们帮助匈牙利人民，也就是支持匈牙利人民的独立和自由。
    布拉格市长斯沃波达在讲话的时候，请中国客人把布拉格劳动人民的敬意带给北京劳动人民。
    在招待会上，捷克斯洛伐克党和政府领导人还同代表团负责人长时间的亲切交谈。气氛十分友好融洽。
