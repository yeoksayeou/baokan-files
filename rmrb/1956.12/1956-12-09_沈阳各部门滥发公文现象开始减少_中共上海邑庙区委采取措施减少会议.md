    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th: After inspecting the bureaucratic work style, the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee and the People's Committees of each district have begun to reduce the phenomenon of excessive issuance of official documents by various departments. According to statistics from the General Office of the Municipal People's Committee, the number of requests for instructions received by the Municipal People's Committee and the General Office from various departments in July and August this year decreased by 20% compared with May and June before the inspection of bureaucratic work style. September saw a further decrease of 9.4% compared to August, and the number of documents received in October and November continued to decrease. The result of streamlining official documents not only saves manpower in various processes such as document receiving, dispatching, and printing, but also helps leading cadres to devote more time to going deep into the lower levels to understand practical problems.
    Shenyang began a comprehensive inspection of bureaucratic work styles in various units this summer. The inspection revealed that the bureaucratic work style in various departments and districts was very serious, and in some units it had even become rampant. For example, the leading cadres of some bureaus completely delegated the power to sign documents to secretaries, resulting in the issuance of a large number of official documents without their knowledge. Some section chiefs in the Health Bureau handed over their seals to clerks for safekeeping, and the clerks stamped documents on behalf of the section chiefs without them even reading the drafts. Some agencies, even though they were working in the same building, also issued documents to each other to coordinate matters. The phenomenon of backlogged official documents was also quite serious. Based on the inspection results, the Beishi District held a small-scale exhibition against bureaucratic work style, and units such as the Health Bureau took measures to simplify the procedures for circulating official documents and streamlined some unnecessary official correspondence. The Municipal People's Committee also formulated a document processing system.
    This newspaper reports: The CCP Shanghai Yimiao District Committee has taken a series of measures to resolutely reduce the excessive number of meetings of grassroots party organizations, liberating many grassroots branches from the chaos, and promoting the improvement of working methods among the vast number of cadres, making the relationship between the Party and the masses closer.
    Shanghai's Yimiao District is an urban area where handicrafts, small factories, and small shops are relatively concentrated. The vast majority of members of grassroots party organizations are workers directly involved in production. Excessive meetings have become an unbearable burden for them. For example, Lu Huiren, the party branch secretary of the jointly-owned Bimeikang Factory, attended forty-eight meetings in March alone. As a result of excessive meetings, the production and learning of party members were seriously affected, and the relationship between party members and the masses was also estranged. Wang Huiying of the jointly-owned Linkang Sock Factory often failed to meet the targets she set in labor competitions because she was often in meetings during production time. When Lu Huiren, the party branch secretary of the Bimeikang Factory, went out to attend meetings, production was suspended for several hours because no one could replace him. The masses satirized these comrades as "politically active elements, backward elements in production." Many cadres of party organizations could not study culture well because they also had meetings in the evenings.
    In response to these situations, the CCP Yimiao District Committee took the following measures: The first was to solve the problem of cadres holding too many concurrent positions. The phenomenon of principal cadres of grassroots organizations holding too many concurrent positions was common. Some people even held seven to nine positions, from branch secretary to director of the literacy association and sports association, managing everything. This forced them to spend a lot of time attending meetings, making it impossible for them to frequently go deep among the masses. Therefore, in order to free cadres from excessive meetings, it was necessary to reduce their concurrent positions. The Yimiao District Committee has proposed to grassroots party organizations that the party branch secretary and deputy secretary, the chairman and deputy chairman of the trade union, and the party branch secretary of the Communist Youth League should not hold concurrent positions. Party branch members should generally not concurrently serve as members of the Communist Youth League and the trade union. It is necessary to promote and absorb more outstanding workers and outstanding Communist Youth League members to participate in the leadership of the Communist Youth League and the trade union. Under the unified leadership of the District Committee, various grassroots organizations have planned to promote a number of cadres. In the commercial system of the district, 45 cadres have been promoted. Now, the cadres of the twenty-nine branches of the thirty-one district stores in the district have basically no concurrent positions. Secondly, the District Committee strictly controlled the meetings of various departments of the District Committee, stipulating that only on Tuesdays and Fridays during non-production hours can grassroots cadres be convened to attend meetings that are truly necessary, and the duration of the meetings should generally not exceed two hours. The District Committee's departments should obtain the approval of the District Committee and register in advance when convening district-wide meetings of grassroots cadres. When this system was first implemented, many cadres were not used to it and felt that work could not be carried out. However, later developments showed that not only were meetings greatly reduced and the quality of meetings improved, but also cadres were prompted to strengthen the planning of their work, improve their working methods, and replace meetings with individual activities, making the relationship between cadres and the masses closer than in the past.

### 沈阳各部门滥发公文现象开始减少  中共上海邑庙区委采取措施减少会议

　　沈阳各部门滥发公文现象开始减少
    中共上海邑庙区委采取措施减少会议
    新华社沈阳6日电　沈阳市人民委员会和各区的人民委员会，在检查文牍主义作风以后，各部门滥发公文的现象开始减少。据市人民委员会办公厅统计，今年七、八两月份市人民委员会及办公厅收到各部门的请示公文，比检查文牍主义以前的五、六两月份减少了20％，9月份又比8月份减少9.4％，10月和11月份收文的数字还在减少。公文精简的结果，不但可以节省公文收发、打印各个运转、打印等环节的人力，并且有助于领导干部抽出更多的时间深入到下层去接触实际问题。
    沈阳市在今年夏天开始普遍检查各单位的文牍主义作风。检查中发现各部门和各区的文牍主义作风很严重，某些单位甚至已经泛滥成灾。如有的局的领导干部把签署文件的权力完全交给了秘书，结果发出大量公文还不知道，卫生局的一些科长把手戳交给科员代管，科长不看文稿，就由科员代为盖章。有些机关同在一座房子里办公，也互相发文联系事情。积压公文的现象也相当严重。根据检查结果，北市区举办了小型的反对文牍主义展览会，卫生局等单位采取措施简化了公文运转手续，精简了一些不必要的行文。市人民委员会也制定了文书处理制度。
    本报讯　中共上海邑庙区委员会采取了一系列的措施，坚决减少基层党组织会议过多的现象，使全区许多基层支部从忙乱中解放出来，并且推动广大干部改进了工作方法，更加密切了党和群众的关系。
    上海邑庙区是一个手工业、小工厂和小商店较为集中的市区，基层党组织的成员绝大部分是直接参加生产的工人，过多的会议，使他们不堪负担。如公私合营毕美康厂党支部书记陆惠仁，3月份一个月就参加了四十八次会议。会议过多的结果，严重地影响了党员的生产和学习，使党员和群众的关系也疏远了。公私合营林康袜厂的王慧英，因为常常在生产时间开会，在劳动竞赛中就经常达不到自己提出的指标。毕美康厂的党支部书记陆惠仁出去开会，因为无人接替他的工作，竟使生产停顿了几个小时。群众讽刺这些同志是“政治上的积极分子，生产上的落后分子。”还有不少党组织的干部，因为晚上也开会，不能很好地学习文化。
    中共邑庙区委针对这些情况，采取了下面的措施：首先是解决干部兼职过多问题。基层组织的主要干部兼职过多的现象是普遍的，有的人甚至身兼七职到九职，从支部书记直到扫盲协会、体育协会的主任，什么事都管，这样就使他们要拿出很多时间来开会，不可能经常深入到群众中去。因此，要想干部摆脱过多的会议，必须减少他们的兼职。邑庙区委已向基层党组织提出：党支部正副书记、工会正副主席、团支部正书记都不要兼职，党支部委员一般不要兼任团支部和工会委员，要提拔和吸收更多的优秀职工和优秀团员参加团和工会的领导工作。在区委统一领导下，各个基层组织都有计划地提拔了一批干部，在全区商业系统中就提拔了干部四十五人。现在全区三十一个区店的二十九个支部的干部都已基本上不兼职。其次区委又严格地控制了区委各部门的会议，规定每星期只有星期二、五的非生产时间内，可以召集基层干部来出席确属必要的会议，会议的时间一般不能超过两小时。区委各部召开全区性的基层干部会议，要经过区委批准，并且要预先登记。这个制度在开始贯彻时，许多干部都不习惯，觉得工作无法开展。但是后来的情况表明，这样做不但会议大大地减少了，会议的质量提高了，而且促使干部加强了工作的计划性，改进了工作方法，用个别活动代替了会议，使干部和群众的关系比过去密切了。
