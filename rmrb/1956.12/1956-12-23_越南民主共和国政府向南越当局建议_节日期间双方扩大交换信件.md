Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 21st. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has suggested to the South Vietnamese authorities that they expand the exchange of family postcards and letters during Christmas, New Year, and the Spring Festival.

    In a letter to the South Vietnamese Postal Administration dated December 20th, the General Postal Administration of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam stated that expanding the exchange of letters during these holidays would satisfy the desire of people in both regions to learn about the lives of their relatives living in the other region.

    Up to now, the exchange between the northern and southern regions of Vietnam has been limited to simple family postcards. In May of this year, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam suggested expanding the exchange of postcards to include letters, but has not received a reply from the Southern authorities.

    越南民主共和国政府向南越当局建议
    节日期间双方扩大交换信件
    据新华社河内21日电　越南民主共和国政府向南越当局建议，在圣诞节、元旦和春节期间，双方扩大交换家庭明信片和交换信函。
    越南民主共和国邮电总局在20日写给南越邮电局的信中说，在这些节日期间扩大交换信件，将满足双方地区人民了解生活在对方地区的他们的亲人的愿望。
    到目前为止，越南北南两地区之间还只限于交换简单的家庭明信片。今年5月间，越南民主共和国方面曾经建议将交换明信片扩大到交换信函，但是一直没有得到南方当局的答复。
