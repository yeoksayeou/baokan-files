　　Construction Funds Are Not Enough
　　In 1953, the State Construction Commission issued a regulation: the construction preparation fee for new factories—the wages of construction personnel, travel expenses, etc.—should be equivalent to 1% of the factory's total investment. By 1956, the prices of steel, cement, machinery, etc., had all decreased. A similar factory used to cost more than 60 million yuan, but now it only costs more than 30 million yuan. The total investment has been reduced significantly. On the other hand, the wages of the staff have increased, and railway freight rates have also risen. In this way, the construction preparation fee, which accounts for "1%" of the total investment, has decreased in actual amount, while the expenditure has increased. How should this account be reported?
　　National regulations are law for subordinate levels, but these regulations must be changed with the changing circumstances to facilitate the implementation and compliance by the lower levels. Of course, it is troublesome to promptly revise outdated rules, systems, and quotas as circumstances and conditions change. However, no matter how troublesome, changes must be made. Otherwise, it will hinder, mislead, or simply become impractical and turn into a formality.

　　筹建费不够用了
    1953年，国家建设委员会发布了一项规定：新厂的筹建费——筹建人员的工资，出差费等等，相等于这个厂总投资额的1％。到了1956年，钢材、水泥、机器等等都降价了，同样的工厂，以前要用六千多万元，现在只要三千多万元，总投资额减少了许多；另一方面，工作人员的工资提高了，铁路的运价也涨了。这样一来，占总投资额“1％”的筹建费，实数减少了，支出却增加了。这笔账怎么报呢？
    国家的规定对下级来说就是法律，但这些规定必须随着情况的变化加以改变，才便于下级贯彻遵守。当然，随着情况、条件的变化，及时修改过了时的规程、制度、定额，是一件麻烦事。然而，无论怎样麻烦，改总要改的。否则，就要碍事、误事，或者干脆行不通，变成形式。
