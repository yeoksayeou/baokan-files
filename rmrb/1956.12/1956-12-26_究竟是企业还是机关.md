    Enterprise or Government Agency After All?
    To the Editor:
    The First Ministry of Machine Building's sales bureau's office in Chongqing was established in 1953, but the First Ministry of Machine Building has never determined whether it is a government agency or an enterprise. Because its "identity" is unclear, the office's 137 cadres cannot enjoy labor insurance benefits nor public medical care. To solve this problem, in November of this year, a comrade from the sales bureau's personnel department went to several units in the First Ministry of Machine Building, but the answer was always, "You say it's a government agency," and "He says it's an enterprise," and no one could decide. Who will decide in the end?
    Liu Qingqi, First Ministry of Machine Building Sales Bureau

    究竟是企业还是机关编辑同志：
    第一机械工业部销售局在重庆的办事处是在1953年设立的，但是第一机械工业部始终没有确定它是机关还是企业。因为“身份”不明，这个办事处的一百三十七名干部既不能享受劳保待遇，又不能享受公费医疗。为了解决这个问题，今年11月份，销售局人事处的一个同志在第一机械工业部跑了好几个单位，仍然是你说是机关，他说是企业，谁也不能决定。到底谁来决定呢？
