    Kailuan Discovers New Coal Seam
    (Xinhua News Agency) The Tangjiazhuang Mine in Kailuan Coal Mine also contains rich, mineable coal seams. Based solely on calculations of the mineable coal seams in a newly opened mining area, the lifespan of the existing mine shafts can be extended by more than twenty years.
    The Tangjiazhuang Mine was plundered by imperialism in the past, and most of the known coal seams underground were mined out, leaving behind mostly discarded thin coal seams and coal pillars. From 1953, the mine began to look for coal. After more than three years of exploration, it was discovered that there are still a large number of mineable coal seams in the sixteen-square-kilometer basin on the east wing of the mine. The quality of the coal is also very good, and most of it can be used as coking coal. Therefore, a new mining area was opened here.

    开滦发现新煤层
    据新华社讯　开滦煤矿唐家庄矿还蕴藏着丰富的可采煤层。只就最近新开辟的一个采煤区的可采煤层计算，就能够使这个矿现有矿井的开采寿命延长二十多年。
    唐家庄矿过去受到帝国主义的掠夺，井下的已知煤层大部分被采光，剩下来的多是些被丢弃的薄煤层和煤柱。从1953年起，这个矿开始找煤，经过三年多的勘探，发现在矿井东翼十六平方公里的盆地内，还有大量的可采煤层，煤的质量也很好，大部分可作炼焦用的配煤。于是在这里开辟了一个新采区。
