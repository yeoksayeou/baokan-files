Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 30th: Anwar Sadat published an article in "Al-Gomhuria" on the 29th, again warning British Prime Minister Eden not to play with fire.

Sadat referred to the recent statement by British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, who argued that Gaza should no longer belong to the Arab region.

Sadat said: "We can frankly tell Eden that the obvious tendency of the Israeli side not to implement the United Nations resolutions must have been instigated by Britain." He pointed out that this attitude of Israel would inevitably hinder the rapid clearing of the Suez Canal, and therefore would prevent Britain from obtaining oil from Arab countries.

"Al Messa" editor Mohieddin wrote in "Al Messa" that Egypt's agreement to clear the canal before the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops further proves its goodwill and its concern for the interests of countries using the canal waterway. However, Mohieddin said that countries concerned about the passage of the canal should take a firm stand on the implementation of the United Nations resolutions. They should bear in mind: "Israel's delay in withdrawing troops from Sinai and the Gaza Strip will once again endanger the passage of the canal, because Egypt cannot stand idly by in the face of such a provocative attitude."

An editorial in "Al-Ahram" mentioned the proposed trip to the Middle East by U.S. President's special envoy Harold Stassen. The newspaper pointed out that Stassen's future report to the President "should be nothing but a suggestion that imperialist countries should abandon their attempts to dominate the Middle East region. They should recognize that Middle Eastern countries have the right to enjoy full freedom and the right to adopt a neutral policy."

    英国唆使以色列军不撤出加沙
    埃及报纸警告艾登不要玩火
    据新华社开罗30日电　安瓦尔·萨达特29日在“共和国报”上发表文章，再次警告英国首相艾登不要玩火。
    萨达特提到英国外交大臣劳埃德最近的声明，劳埃德主张加沙不应当再成为阿拉伯地区。
    萨达特说：“我们可以坦白地告诉艾登，以色列方面不想执行联合国决议的明显趋向一定是英国唆使的。”他指出，以色列的这种态度必然会妨碍迅速清理苏伊士运河，因而也就不能使英国从阿拉伯国家得到石油。
    “晚报”编辑毛希丁在“晚报”上写道，埃及同意在以色列军队完全撤出以前清理运河，进一步证明了她的善意，以及她对运河水道使用国家的利益的关切。但是，毛希丁说，关心运河通行的国家应该采取坚定的立场来对待联合国决议的执行问题。他们应该牢记在心：“以色列迟迟不从西奈和加沙地带撤兵将再次危及运河的通行，因为埃及面对这种挑衅态度不能袖手旁观。”
    “金字塔报”的社论提到了拟议中的美国总统特使哈罗德·史塔生的中东之行。这家报纸指出，史塔生将来给总统的报告“不应该是别的，而是建议帝国主义国家应该放弃主宰中东地区的企图。它们应该承认中东国家有权享有充分的自由，也有权采取中立政策”。
