　　In the Anti-Imperialist Struggle, Neutrality is Not Possible
　　Sukarno Calls for Support for Egypt
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 2nd. According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian President Sukarno called on all Indonesian people on the evening of December 1st to support the struggle of the Egyptian people who are currently suffering from aggression. Sukarno said that our support for the struggle of the Egyptian people is equal to supporting our own struggle, because the struggle of the Egyptian people is our own struggle, and our struggle is also the struggle of the Egyptian people.

　　Sukarno issued this call at the "Egyptian Evening" sponsored by the "Support Egyptian People's Struggle Committee" in Jakarta. The evening was held at the Independence Palace. The Egyptian Ambassador to Indonesia, Anrosi, also attended the evening.

　　In his speech, President Sukarno reiterated his earlier view that communism and capitalism can coexist, but nationalism and imperialism cannot coexist. President Sukarno said that our independent policy advocates the coexistence of the communist and capitalist blocs. The facts of the past forty years have proved that these two systems can coexist, and they have even cooperated in the war against Hitler as long as they do not interfere in each other's internal affairs. Sukarno then pointed out that nationalism and imperialism cannot coexist because imperialism essentially contains the content of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

　　President Sukarno said that therefore, in the struggle of nationalism against imperialism, a neutral attitude cannot be adopted. He cited the struggle of the Egyptian people as an example, saying that the Egyptian people are currently suffering from inhuman aggression, and in this regard, we are aiding the Egyptian people.

　  在反帝斗争中不能中立
　　苏加诺号召支援埃及
    据新华社雅加达2日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在12月1日晚上号召全体印度尼西亚人民支援目前正在遭受侵略的埃及人民的斗争。苏加诺说，我们支援埃及人民的斗争等于支援我们自己的斗争，因为埃及人民的斗争是我们自己的斗争，而我们的斗争也是埃及人民的斗争。
    苏加诺在雅加达“支援埃及人民斗争委员会”主办的“埃及晚会”上发出了这个号召。晚会是在独立宫举行的。埃及驻印度尼西亚大使安罗西也出席了这个晚会。
    苏加诺总统在讲话中重申他前些时候说过的这种意见：共产主义和资本主义是可以实现共处的，但是民族主义和帝国主义是不可能共处的。苏加诺总统说，我们的自主政策倡议在共产主义集团和资本主义集团之间实现共处。最近四十年来的事实证明，这两种制度是能够共处的，只要不互相干涉内政，它们在反对希特勒的大战中甚至还曾经合作过。苏加诺接着指出，民族主义和帝国主义之所以不能共处，是因为帝国主义实质上包含着干预别国内政的内容。
    苏加诺总统说，因此在民族主义反对帝国主义的斗争中，不能采取中立的态度。他举出埃及人民的斗争为例说，埃及人民目前正在遭受惨无人道的侵略，在这方面我们是援助埃及人民的。
