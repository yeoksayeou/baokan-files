　　Futile “Wise Men”
　　In May of this year, the noisy North Atlantic Treaty Council established a committee of three “wise men.” The task given to the “wise men” was to come up with a plan for civilized political, economic, and cultural "cooperation" for this military group armed to the teeth.

　　At the time, Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, and Italian Foreign Minister Martino, as the three "wise men," all felt flattered. They knew the task was really not light, first of all because they did not know what the US intentions were. Therefore, Pearson could not help but think that they were simply doing the work of "three blind mice."

　　The "wise men" still made some effort. They put forward thirty-six difficult problems to ask the United States for instructions. As a result, they finally drafted a report on a "cooperation" plan. This report was also passed at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Council.

　　However, the "wise men" did not think that their hard work could save the military group from the crisis full of contradictions.

　　Pearson said: Whether their report "has significant meaning" will depend on "what actions the governments take on it."

　　According to Lange, the major member states of the military group often like to act on their own and lack the "habit of political consultation."

　　Therefore, Martino could not help but doubt how much value their report really had. It was not without reason that he said that it is not difficult to put forward suggestions, but to implement these suggestions "is much more difficult."

　　In fact, this Paris meeting had already cast a shadow on the "cooperation" plan. The meeting decided that the foreign policies of the member states should be supervised by the United States through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is to say that the independence of Western European countries would be cancelled. However, at the same time, Dulles declared at the meeting that the United States reserves the freedom to take unilateral action without consulting the member states. The American "habit" is: only allow oneself to have freedom, not give freedom to others. However, Mollet has already stated that he will never give up, he warned that "cooperation" cannot be a one-sided matter.

　　"Cooperation," and so on, is just like this. This cannot but doom the labor of the "wise men" to be somewhat in vain.

### 徒劳“贤人”

    徒劳“贤人”
    今年5月，吵吵闹闹的北大西洋公约理事会，成立了三“贤人”委员会。给“贤人”的任务是：替这个武装到牙齿的军事集团，搞出一个文明的政治、经济和文化“合作”的计划来。
    当时，加外长皮尔逊、挪外长兰格和意外长马蒂诺，作为三“贤人”，都感到受宠若惊。他们知道，任务实在不轻，首先是不知道美国的意图何在。因此，皮尔逊不禁认为，他们简直做了“三只瞎耗子”。
    “贤人”还是作了一番努力。他们提出三十六个难题，请示美国。结果总算拟出了一个“合作”计划的报告。这个报告也在这次北大西洋公约理事会巴黎会议通过了。
    可是，“贤人”并不认为自己的劳苦，可以把军事集团从矛盾重重的危机中挽救出来。
    皮尔逊说：他们的报告“是否具有重要意义”还要取决于“各国政府就它采取什么行动”。
    据兰格的看法，军事集团的主要成员国常常喜欢各自行动，而缺乏“政治磋商的习惯”。
    因此，马蒂诺不禁怀疑起他们的报告究竟有多大价值。他不是没有根据地说，提出建议不难，实行这些建议“就要困难得多了”。
    实际上，这次巴黎会议就已给“合作”计划蒙上了暗影。会议决定各成员国的外交政策要通过北大西洋公约组织接受美国的监督，也就是取消西欧国家的任何独立性。可是，同时，杜勒斯却在会上声明，美国保留不同成员国商量而采取单独行动的自由。美国的“习惯”是：只许自己有自由，不给别人自由。不过，摩勒已经表示决不甘休，他警告说：“合作”不能是单方面的事。
    “合作”云云，如此而已。这就不能不注定“贤人”的劳苦有点枉然了。
