    “Here's an Additional Thirty-Five Yuan for You”
    In November, I sold a telescope at the Zhongchang Third Branch on Xidan Xuannei Avenue in Beijing. I had bought it in Shanghai a few years ago. The original price was relatively low, and I sold it for only fifteen yuan at the time. Unexpectedly, on December 11th, I went to the Zhongchang Third Branch again to sell a watch. They said, "You've come at the right time. The telescope sold for more than what we bought it from you for, so we should give you an additional thirty-five yuan.” I was stunned when I heard this; but I quickly realized that this was the new atmosphere after the public-private partnership, and I smiled happily.
    On the way home, this matter kept swirling in my mind. I remember buying a broken watch at a second-hand shop in Shanghai before liberation. The surface looked like a beautiful "Omega" brand; but when I opened it, the inner workings were old, mismatched parts. Such deceptive practices were common in the old society. Today, especially after the full industry-wide public-private partnership, everything has begun to change. Truly, public-private partnerships are welcomed by everyone. As a citizen of the new China, how can I not be excited about this gratifying new atmosphere! 　Sūn Tóngwǔ

    “再补给你三十五元”
    11月份，我在北京西单宣内大街中昌第三门市部卖了一个望远镜。这是我几年前从上海买来的，原来价钱比较便宜，当时只卖了十五元。出乎意料的是：12月11日，我因为卖表又到中昌第三门市部去了一趟。他们说：“你来了，正好。望远镜售出的价钱比买你的贵，应该再补给你三十五元。”我听了此话，不禁楞了一下；但很快就意识到这是公私合营后的新风气，因此高兴得笑了。
    在回家的途中，在我脑子里一直翻腾着这件事。记得在解放前，我在上海一家旧货店买过一只破表，表面看来是“欧米格”名牌货，很漂亮；后来拆开来看，里边的机器却是陈旧不堪的杂牌子货。像这种骗人的事，在旧社会里是常见的。今天，特别是在全行业公私合营以后，一切已经开始改变了；真是公私合营，人人欢迎。作为一个新中国的公民，对这种可喜的新风气，怎能不感到兴奋呢！　孙同武
