    Tianjin Tractor Factory Strives to Do More with Less Money
    Tractor Production Will Continue on Schedule Despite Investment Cuts
    (Our report) The Tianjin Tractor Factory, despite a two-thirds reduction in its basic construction investment for next year compared to the original plan, is finding ways to ensure that it can still produce tractors according to the original schedule.
    The expansion project of the Tianjin Tractor Factory began in September of this year. According to the original plan, in addition to completing the projects already under construction next year, a new forging workshop, a steel casting workshop, a welfare building for employees, and some employee dormitories were to be built. Most of the machinery and equipment were also to be purchased and installed next year, striving to officially produce tractors in 1958.
    Recently, the state decided to reduce the factory's investment for next year by two-thirds. The factory leadership immediately convened relevant cadres and engineering technicians to study how to strive to produce tractors according to the original schedule. Everyone believed that it was possible to produce tractors according to the original schedule and came up with some specific measures. In terms of civil engineering: it was decided that except for the projects that have already started construction, which will continue to be built next year, most of the other projects planned to start next year will be postponed. In order to solve the production problem of forging, in addition to finding ways to maximize the production potential of the original forging workshop, it is planned to build a shed outside the newly built metalworking workshop to place part of the equipment of the newly added forging workshop inside for production. In order to solve the production problem of steel casting, it is planned to reduce the floor space occupied by machines in the rebuilt foundry workshop, leaving some space to install steel casting equipment. In terms of machinery and equipment: it is planned to adopt a combination of mechanization and manual operation, changing some of the original plans for mechanization to manual operation, so as to greatly reduce non-standard equipment; for the same type of machine tool, which was originally planned to purchase two or three units, only one will be purchased; some equipment that has been purchased but is not urgently needed will be resold in order to concentrate funds on purchasing necessary equipment; some large and expensive equipment will also not be purchased, and a cooperative approach with other factories will be adopted to solve the problem. In terms of utilizing existing equipment: it is planned to use old machines that were not originally planned to be used, so that the production of new and old products can be carried out simultaneously, that is, the same machine tool must produce both old products and new products; in addition, some old machines will also be renovated, such as changing the furnace in the forging workshop to a reverberatory furnace to increase production.
    The factory leaders and employees are very confident in striving to produce tractors according to the original schedule. At present, engineering and technical personnel have begun to revise the design, and the factory is also preparing to mobilize all employees to put forward rationalization proposals to further tap the potential of the enterprise to ensure the realization of this plan.

### 天津拖拉机制造厂争取少花钱多办事  投资削减后仍将按期出产拖拉机

    天津拖拉机制造厂争取少花钱多办事
    投资削减后仍将按期出产拖拉机
    本报讯　天津拖拉机制造厂在明年的基本建设投资比原计划减少三分之二的情况下，多方面想办法，预计仍可按原定进度生产出拖拉机。
    天津拖拉机制造厂的扩建工程是今年9月份动工的。按照原来的计划，明年除了完成已经施工的工程外，还要新建一个锻工车间、一个铸钢车间、一幢职工福利大楼和一部分职工宿舍。大部分机器设备也要在明年购妥并进行安装。争取在1958年正式生产拖拉机。
    最近，国家决定把这个厂明年的投资削减三分之二。工厂领导方面立即召集了有关干部和工程技术人员，研究如何争取按原定进度生产拖拉机。大家认为，按照原来的进度生产出拖拉机是可能的，并且想出了一些具体办法。在土建工程方面：决定除已经动工的工程要在明年继续施工外，其它计划在明年开工的工程大部推迟。为了解决锻工的生产问题，除设法发挥原有锻工车间的生产潜力外，准备在新建起来的金工工场外边搭一个棚子，把新添的锻工车间的一部分设备放在里边进行生产；为了解决铸钢的生产问题，准备在改建后的铸工车间缩小机器占地面积，让出一部分地方安装铸钢设备。在机器设备方面：准备采取机械化和手工操作同时进行的办法，把有些原来计划用机械的改为用手工操作，以大大减少非标准设备；同一型号的机床原来准备购买两三台的，只购买一台；有些已经购妥但不急需的设备将转售出去，以便集中资金购买必需的设备；有些大型设备和贵重设备也不准备买了，将采取同其它工厂协作的办法解决。在利用原有设备方面：准备把原来没有计划用的老机器用上，使新老产品的生产交叉进行，即同一机床一方面要生产老产品，一方面还要生产新产品；另外，还要改造一部分旧机器，如把锻工车间的烘炉改为反射炉，以提高生产。
    对于争取按原定进度生产出拖拉机，这个厂领导上和职工的信心都很足，目前，工程技术人员已经着手修改设计，工厂还准备发动全体职工提合理化建议，进一步挖掘企业潜力，以保证这一计划的实现。
