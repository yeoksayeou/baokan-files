W.E.B. Du Bois's Letter of Greetings

To the comrades of the Conference of the People's Republic of China commemorating the 250th anniversary of Franklin's birth:

Since my country refuses to allow me to accept your kind invitation to attend such a great commemoration, please allow me to say a few words in writing.

I was born one hundred and sixty-two years later than Franklin, but I share with him some of the same social heritage; I was also born in New England, a region that intellectually and practically guided the United States in most of its cultural life. Therefore, I am able to introduce his life and significance to Asia more clearly than other Americans today.

Franklin was a more free-thinking and free-acting person than most of his contemporaries. Fortunately, his talent and strong character made this freedom of great benefit to the world, a freedom that might have been a threat in someone of lower status than himself. This fact made him realize earlier than most Americans that if a country is to make great progress and valuable contributions at that time, freedom should be limited in national life. Whenever a person's spirit is restricted, there will be some loss to humanity; on the other hand, if behavioral indulgence and chaos are widely allowed, the loss to humanity will be even greater, and the harm will be more severe.

Franklin learned this lesson early in life. He grew up in the serious atmosphere of a family deeply bound by religious doctrines, where strict patriarchal rule was traditional. He did not receive the kind of education he wanted, and the education he did receive was self-taught. He opposed becoming a candle maker and preferred to be a printer, not just for typesetting, but to write something worth printing. When this did not work out, he disregarded the patriarchal rule and went out into life alone. He entered a world that, to a large extent, had no laws or discipline. Even when there were no laws or discipline to control people, he never forgot for a moment that laws and discipline were necessary. Therefore, he prescribed rules of conduct for himself and strictly abided by them. Thus, in a special sense, he established himself in a new country and a new era by his own strength.

He was born into slavery, when one in every five people was a black slave, and every white person had a slave. At first, he did not pay attention to this. As a young and lucky merchant, he himself traded slaves like wine, oil, fish, tea, and horses. Public affairs brought him into contact with black Indians, and he slowly came to respect them. Soon, he realized the evils of slavery. In his old age, he became more aware that freedom and slavery were irreconcilable, and he became the first president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. He was born into an orthodox Puritan family, but he abandoned doctrine and, as a free thinker, died without any religious ceremony. He lived most of his life with stubborn Puritans, and although these people always respected him and cooperated with him, he never joined their powerful group. Franklin sometimes compromised and sometimes retreated, but in his ideology, he never forgot the greater goals in life.

In short, Franklin advocated political unification of the country, opposed the independence of the states, and opposed groups and individuals who only talked about freedom without any restrictions. Early in his career as a postmaster and merchant, he realized that these small colonial groups, each governing itself in language, religion, and economic organization, could never develop into the United States of America. His plan of union drawn up in 1754 became the prelude to pushing the colonial states towards national unification. He was a loyal Englishman and felt honored by the power of the British Empire. But when he was sent to England, he had to explain to the British that Americans were also human beings, not slaves of the imperial colonial system. He stood more and more firmly for this argument, resisted abuse, and even risked his life. After returning home, he prepared to resort to revolution rather than bow to British colonialism. He was old, sick, and tired, and needed rest. But when the people called him, he shouldered the burden of telling France about the American disaster, obtained an alliance, and thus enabled his country to gain independence.

He could not have accomplished his great cause if it had not been for another immortal characteristic of his, which was his curiosity about the world around him. In the process of seeking truth, he never stopped until he achieved certain results. After he had some property due to printing, selling books, and doing business, he retired to do experiments in what people at that time called "natural science." He studied animals, plants, land, wind direction, and climate, and at the same time studied the sky in detail, until he discovered that there was the same electricity in the sky as on the ground. He engaged in independent amateur research with little money and poor scientific guidance. Through diligence and perseverance, he gained recognition and praise from the scientific community. When he put down his experiments and theories and went to Europe, people regarded him not only as a colonial politician, but also as a scientist. From this, we can see his strength and brilliant achievements. In his busy life of eighty-four years, he remained true to his interests. He was humorous and energetic, and his love affair with women showed the joyous life of 18th-century Paris. He drank, made merry, traveled, and read. He visited friends, talked with guests, wrote long letters, and planned to fight for war and peace. His life was rich and full of mistakes and victories, and it is still worthy of your attention today.

As an American of black descent—ten million black slaves were smuggled in, and they worked hard to turn the ideals of America into reality—now that socialism has triumphed in your country, I am very honored to be able to have contact with your great country, which is rapidly advancing, freeing a nation from racial prejudice, dedicating itself to world peace, and determined to rid millions of working people of the exploitation of labor, which is still rampant in Europe, Asia, and Africa, especially since 1619, it has enslaved our people and has not yet been completely abolished today. Although the kindest Americans have fought effectively to crush our last shackles, we are still second-class citizens in America. It is fitting that people like Franklin, who began to recognize and liberate us, on the occasion of his birth, through the black people of America, I can establish at least spiritual contact with the great Chinese people who have achieved final victory today.

I pay tribute to you in the name of my seventeen million black brothers!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

    威廉·杜波依斯的贺信
    致中华人民共和国纪念富兰克林诞生二百五十周年大会同志们：
    因为我的国家拒绝让我接受你们善意的邀请，出席这样一个伟大的纪念会，请允许我以书面的方式讲几句话。
    我比富兰克林晚生一百六十二年，但我和他分享了一些同一的社会遗产；我也生在新英格兰，这个地区以它大部分的文化生活在思想上和行动上引导了美国。因此我能够比其他现在美国人更加清楚地向亚洲介绍他的生活和意义。
    富兰克林是个远较他同时代的人更能自由思想和自由行动的人。幸运的是，他的天赋和坚强的性格使得这个自由对世界有莫大的好处，这种自由在比他身分低下的人是可能成为威胁的。这个事实使他比大多数美国人更早一些地明白了，假如一个国家在当时有很大的进展，和有价值的贡献，那么，在国家生活中，自由是应该有范围的。无论什么时候，一个人的精神受到限制，对人类来说就会有一些损失；另一方面，如果广泛地允许行为上的放纵和混乱，人类的损失就会更大，伤害也就更重些。
    这个教训，富兰克林很早在生活里就学到了。他在一个深受宗教教义束缚家庭的严肃气氛中成长起来，在这个家庭里，严肃的家长统治是传统性的。他自己所想要受的那种教育，他没有得到，而他所得到的教育，都是自学来的。他反对成为一个制作蜡烛的人，倒是愿意作个印刷工人，不光是为排版，而是要写些值得印刷的东西。当这件事情行不通时，他不顾家长的统治，独自一人走向生活。他进入了一个在很大程度上说没有什么法律和纪律的世界。就是在没有法律和纪律来管制人的时候，他也从来没有片刻忘记法律和纪律是必要的。因之他给自己的行为规定了守则，自己严格地遵守。这样从特殊的意义来说，他是用自己的力量而立身于一个新的国家和一个新的时代中的。
    他生于奴隶制度之中，那时每五个人当中就有一个黑奴，而每个白人都有一个奴隶。起初，他并没有注意这件事，作为一个年轻而又走运的商人来说，他自己也把奴隶和酒、油、鱼、茶、马匹一样贩卖。公共事业使他和黑色印地安人有了交往，他慢慢地尊敬起他们来了。不久，他意识到奴隶制度的罪恶。在他年老的时候，他更加明白了自由和奴隶制是不能调和的，他成为宾夕法尼亚州废除奴隶制协会的第一任主席。他生在一个正统的清教徒家庭，但他摒弃教义，作为一个自由思想者的人，死的时候没有行任何宗教仪式。他一生大部分时间都和顽固的清教徒生活在一起，虽然这些人总是很尊敬他，和他合作，但他从未加入他们有势力的集团。富兰克林有时妥协，有时退让，但在思想意识里，从来没有忘记生活里更伟大的目标。
    总之，富兰克林主张要在政治上统一国家，反对各州独立，反对那种光讲自由而丝毫不受限制的团体和个人。早在他作邮政局长和商人的时候，就认识到这些在语言、宗教和经济组织上各自为政的各个小殖民地集团，决不能发展成为美利坚合众国。他在1754年拟定的联合计划，成为把殖民地各州推向国家统一的先声。他是一个忠实的英国人，同时以大英帝国的威力而感觉光荣。可是当他出使英国时，他必须向英国解释，美国人也是人，而不是帝国殖民制度的奴隶。为了这个论点，他站得越来越坚定，反抗辱骂，甚至不惜冒生命的危险。他回国以后，准备诉诸于革命，而不向英国殖民制度低头。他衰老、生病和疲惫了，需要休息。但当人民召唤他的时候，他就担负起向法国倾诉美国灾难的重担，取得了同盟，从而使他的国家获得独立。
    若不是他的另一个不朽的特点，他就不可能完成他的伟业，这就是他对于周围世界的好奇心。他在探求真理的过程中，不取得一定的成果决不中止。当他由于印刷、卖书和经商而有了一些财产以后，他就退休作起当时人们称为“自然科学”的实验。他研究动物、植物、土地、风向和气候，同时详细研究天空，直到他发现了天空中有和地上相同的电。他以很少的钱和贫乏的科学指导，从事独立的业余研究。由于勤劳和毅力，获得了科学界的承认和称赞。当他放下实验和理论而去欧洲的时候，人们不仅仅把他当作一个殖民地的政治家，还把他当作一个科学家。从这件事中，就可以看出他的力量和辉煌的成就。在八十四年忙碌的生活中，他一直忠实于他的志趣。他幽默而且精力旺盛，他和女人恋爱显示了十八世纪巴黎的快乐生活。他饮酒行乐，旅行和阅读。他访问朋友，和来宾交谈，撰写长篇信函和计划着为战争和和平而奋斗。他的生活内容丰富，充满错误和胜利，就在今天仍然值得你们的重视。
    作为黑人后代的一个美国人——一千万黑奴是被偷运来的，他们辛勤地劳动，要把和梦想把美国的理想变成事实——现在当你们的国家里社会主义已经胜利的时候，我非常荣幸能够和你们伟大的国家进行接触，你们正在急速前进，使得一个民族解除了种族偏见，献身于世界和平，决心摆脱成百万的劳动人民在劳动上所受到的剥削，这种剥削仍在欧洲、亚洲和非洲逞凶作乱，特别是它从1619年以来，一直奴役着我们的人民，到今天仍然没有完全废除。虽然最善良的美国人为了粉碎我们的最后的束缚，进行了有效的斗争，可是我们仍然是美国的二等公民。像富兰克林式的人们，开始承认和解放我们，在他的诞辰之际，那是合乎时宜的，通过美国的黑人，我，可以和今天已经取得最终胜利的伟大的中国人民，取得至少是精神上的联系。
    谨以我的一千七百万黑人兄弟的名义向你们致敬！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
      威廉·杜波依斯
                    1956.11.19．
