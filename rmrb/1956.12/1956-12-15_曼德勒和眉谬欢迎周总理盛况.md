Xinhua News Agency, Myitkyina, December 13 (Delayed Dispatch) Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long spent a pleasant third day of their visit to Burma on December 12th in northern Burma. Accompanied by U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, and Burmese government officials, they visited Mandalay, the former capital of Burma, toured the Irrawaddy River, and spent the night in the picturesque highland city of Maymyo.

    As soon as Premier Zhou Enlai and others landed at Mandalay Airport, their attention was drawn to a magnificent tent. This tent was built in the style of a Burmese palace, with exquisite eaves and pagodas decorating the front, and golden peacocks and "Naga" (dragons) on both sides of the entrance. The interior of the tent was decorated with imitation gilded pillars and wood carvings painted in bright gold, red, blue, and yellow colors.

    After inspecting the guard of honor, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long were warmly welcomed in the large tent, which was filled with local officials, gentry, and representatives from all walks of life.

    Maw Hnin, Chairman of the Mandalay Municipal Committee, delivered a welcome speech, saying that the Burmese people regard their Chinese brothers as "Pauk Phaw" (fraternal brothers). He also said that the strict implementation of the Five Principles in Sino-Burmese relations will surely bring about closer friendship and more effective cooperation.

    In his reply, Premier Zhou Enlai praised Mandalay as a city with rich cultural traditions and a city that had made glorious contributions to Burma's struggle for independence. He also expressed his conviction that the friendship between the two peoples will continue to be consolidated and developed because both countries are loyal to the spirit of the Five Principles.

    The Chairman of the Mandalay Municipal Committee presented Premier Zhou with a beautiful silver gong hanging on ivory and silver carvings.

    Next, Premier Zhou and others traveled by car through Mandalay City, and later from Mandalay City to the dock on the banks of the Irrawaddy River. The car had to stop frequently along the way as it passed through an almost continuous stream of enthusiastically cheering crowds and waving flags.

    At noon, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long and their party boarded the inland river steamer "Mandalay." Red carpets were laid from the large tent by the river, through the steps of the pier and the gangplank, all the way to the deck of the ship. They toured the gently flowing, wide Irrawaddy River by boat, enjoying the scenery along the way.

    In the afternoon, the guests traveled by car from Mandalay along a winding mountain road for 45 miles to the resort city of Maymyo, which is 3,400 feet above sea level.

    In the evening, General Ne Win, Chief of Staff of the Burmese National Defense Force, hosted a banquet for Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, and their entourage.

    On the 13th, Premier Zhou and his party inspected a military parade in Maymyo, and then returned to Mandalay before heading to Bhamo and Myitkyina.

    曼德勒和眉谬欢迎周总理盛况
    据新华社密支那13日电（迟到）周恩来总理、贺龙副总理12月12日在缅甸北部愉快地度过了在缅甸访问的第三天。他们在缅甸反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努和缅甸政府官员的陪同下，访问了缅甸故都曼德勒，游览了伊洛瓦底江，并且在风景幽美的高原城市眉谬住了一夜。
    在曼德勒机场上，周恩来总理等刚一着陆，目光就被一座富丽堂皇的大帐篷吸引住了。这座大帐篷搭成缅甸宫殿的式样，正面是用精致的檐檐和宝塔来装饰的，入口两旁有金色的孔雀和“那加”（龙）。帐篷的内部是用仿造的镀金柱子和用鲜艳的金、红、蓝、黄各种颜色油漆的木雕装饰起来的。
    周恩来总理、贺龙副总理检阅了仪仗队之后，在坐满了当地的官员、士绅和各界代表的大帐篷里受到了热烈的欢迎。
    曼德勒市政委员会主席貌迎致欢迎词说：缅甸人民把中国兄弟当作“胞波”（同胞兄弟）。他还说：在中缅关系中严格实行五项原则，肯定将会带来更加亲密的友谊和更加有效的合作。
    周恩来总理在致答词的时候赞扬曼德勒是具有丰富文化传统的城市，是曾经对缅甸争取独立的斗争作过光荣贡献的城市。他还表示他确信由于两国人民都忠于五项原则的精神，两国人民间的友谊将会不断巩固和发展。
    曼德勒市政委员会主席送给周总理一个挂在象牙上的漂亮的银锣和银制雕刻品。
    接着，周总理等乘车穿过曼德勒市，后来又从曼德勒市到伊洛瓦底江岸边的码头。汽车穿过几乎是连绵不断的热情欢呼的人群和迎风飘扬的旗帜，一路上常常不得不停下来。
    中午，周恩来总理、贺龙副总理等一行乘上了内河轮船“明顿号”。从江边的大帐篷经过码头的台阶和跳板一直到轮船的甲板都铺着红地毯。他们乘着轮船在静静地流着的宽阔的伊洛瓦底江上游览，欣赏了沿途的风景。
    下午，客人们又从曼德勒乘汽车沿着蜿蜒曲折的山路走过四十五英里路程前往海拔三千四百英尺的避暑城市眉谬。
    晚间，缅甸国防军总参谋长奈温将军设宴招待周恩来总理和贺龙副总理及随行人员。
    13日，周总理等一行在眉谬参观了阅兵式，然后回曼德勒转往八莫和密支那。
