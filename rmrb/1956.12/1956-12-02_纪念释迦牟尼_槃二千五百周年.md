The friendship between the Chinese and Indian nations is long-standing, profound, and sincere. In the historical records of our two great nations, there are only records of amity and friendship, and never any records of war. This is a very precious phenomenon in world cultural history. These two ancient yet young nations are separated by high mountains, deserts, and seas, but these have not severed the traditional friendship between them. One of the important bridges enabling these two great nations to understand and respect each other is the great Sakyamuni and the Buddhism he founded.

The Chinese people are very familiar with the life and thought of Sakyamuni, as familiar as we are with our own nation's great thinkers. Sakyamuni's teachings have been translated into various Chinese Han and Tibetan languages. Just the records about Sakyamuni translated into Chinese and collected in the Tripitaka number no fewer than dozens. The most important are the "Puyao Jing," "Buddha Carita," "Tàizǐ Ruìyìng Běnqǐ Jīng," "Bodhisattva Benqi Jing," "Huiye Bodhisattva Asks about Great Expediency Sutra," "Twelve Travel Sutra," and "Buddha's Acts Sutra." In addition, there are many records about Sakyamuni's life and activities scattered in the "Agama Sutras" and Vinaya Pitaka, the most detailed being the sixty-volume "Abhinişkramaņa Sūtra." Sakyamuni's decades of diligent missionary work had a huge impact. Regarding the works recording the Nirvana of the Buddha, the important extant Chinese translations include the "Youxing Jing," "Buddha's Parinirvana Sutra," "Mahaparinirvana Sutra," and "Buddha's Testamentary Sutra." According to records, the Buddha's posture at the time of Nirvana was "lying on his right side," leaving the world with compassion and serenity. In many provinces of China, there are statues and murals of the Reclining Buddha, and temples named "Reclining Buddha Temple" can be found almost everywhere. This shows the importance that the Chinese people attach to the great event of the Buddha's Nirvana and the sincerity of their commemoration.

Chinese scholars have also written many biographical works about Sakyamuni. Important and earlier ones include Monk You of the Liang Dynasty's "Sakyamuni Genealogy," Fei Changfang of the Sui Dynasty's "Comprehensive Records of the Three Jewels Through the Dynasties," Dao Xuan of the Tang Dynasty's "Sakyamuni Clan Genealogy," and Zhi Pan of the Song Dynasty's "General History of the Buddhas and Patriarchs." After the Song Dynasty, there have been biographical works about Sakyamuni in every dynasty, which need not be detailed here.

In all these ancient Chinese and Indian works, there are inevitably some exaggerations and some discrepancies in the records, but these works all reveal the true image of Sakyamuni. From various Buddhist records, we can see how Sakyamuni abandoned his personal kingship to pursue his lofty ideals. He denounced those tyrannical exploiters; he relentlessly attacked those greedy, selfish, and hypocritical religious believers; he sympathized with those downtrodden and despised so-called lower-class slaves, the poor, debtors, women, and helpless children. In his most basic teachings, he stipulated opposition to violence and war. Sakyamuni fulfilled his belief in advocating equality and loving peace with his life's arduous practice. Among the disciples he accepted, he certainly did not refuse those nobles and wealthy merchants who were willing to abandon wealth and status; but he also accepted Upali, the Shudra caste member who was considered the most "lowly" at the time; he also accepted Maha Pajapati Gotami, a woman who was excluded from religious practice at that time. From the very beginning, Sakyamuni and the Buddhism he founded made a grand vow: to promote equality and oppose class oppression; to love peace and oppose brutal war. It is no accident that he gained widespread support, especially from the lower classes, and was regarded as the "true savior."

The Chinese people, like the Indian people, have a cultural tradition of thousands of years, and have always opposed oppression and loved peace. In history, almost none of the writers and philosophers beloved and supported by our people did not oppose violent oppression and wars of aggression.

Because the Chinese and Indian nations have this basic common fine tradition, the cultural exchange between China and India is like the blending of water and milk, without any obstruction. If we briefly look back at the history of cultural exchanges between the two great nations, we will further enhance our confidence in continuing cooperation in the future.

Starting from the Han Dynasty, Indian monks Kasyapa Matanga and Dharmaraksa introduced the Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters to China. Since then, a large number of Indian scholars have introduced Indian scholarship to China in every dynasty. The examples are endless. The Chinese Jin Dynasty's Faxian, the Tang Dynasty's Xuanzang, Yijing, and many other seekers of Dharma respected by the Chinese people, spared no effort to brave the wind and waves, cross the ocean, traverse the desert, pass through remote areas, risking death, and traveling thousands of miles alone in order to introduce Buddhist scriptures. Their studies and visits in India left a good and deep impression on the Indian people. Their works, such as "A Record of Buddhist Kingdoms," "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions," and "A Record of the Buddhist Religion as Practiced in India and the Malay Archipelago," are still important original sources for the study of India from the fourth to seventh centuries. These facts are familiar to scientists all over the world.

The most valuable record of cultural cooperation between China and India is the translation of Buddhist scriptures. The translation of Buddhist scriptures promoted the understanding between the Chinese and Indian nations on the one hand, and on the other hand, set a good example of international scholars working together and helping each other. Few of the Buddhist classics popular in China were not completed through the joint efforts of scholars and experts from China and India. During the translation, there were various divisions of labor such as "translator," "scribe," "verifier," "reviser," and "proofreader." As the translation progressed, explanations and discussions were carried out simultaneously. Their strict system of careful discussion, repeated study, and finalization, and the spirit of combining translation and research are still worth learning from and their experience is worth drawing from today.

Regarding the connection between Chinese and Indian cultures, what deserves our special attention is the printing of the Tripitaka. As early as the Kaibao period of the Song Dynasty in the late tenth century, China began to print Buddhist scriptures and related series of books—the Tripitaka—using woodblock printing. Since then, there have been supplements in the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. At present, the "Tripitaka" and "Supplementary Tripitaka" collect more than 3,600 classic works, totaling more than 15,600 volumes. Individual works that have not been collected are not included. The "Tripitaka" preserves many Buddhist classics that have been lost in India today, and also includes the creative explanations made by Chinese scholars on Buddhist principles. This historically significant series of books is the most faithful witness of the friendly cooperation and cultural exchange between China and India over the past thousand years.

With the spread of Sakyamuni's thought and Buddhism, the ancient cultures of China and India became richer and more diverse. Ancient Chinese sculpture, music, literature, mathematics, and medicine all left traces of Sino-Indian cooperation and cultural exchange. These also cannot be fully described in a short time. Taking art and literature as examples, writers after the Northern and Southern Dynasties constantly absorbed valuable things from Buddhist classics. Stories from Buddhist scriptures became the themes of artists' paintings for a considerable period. The great Chinese artists Gu Kaizhi and Wu Daozi were both loved by the Chinese people for painting moving stories from Buddhist scriptures. The literary works in Buddhist classics have also deeply moved generations of talented Chinese writers. The intense and unrestrained emotions and unconstrained fantasies that filled certain works of Buddhist classics broadened the horizons of Chinese writers and enriched the content of their creations to varying degrees.

In terms of philosophical thought, Sakyamuni's teachings have had a huge impact among the Chinese people. It is undeniable that the reactionary ruling classes of past dynasties often used Buddhism as a tool to satisfy their selfish purposes. This is only one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, there have been many people in Chinese intellectual circles who have combined the spirit of equality and love of peace advocated in Buddhism to fight against feudal autocracy. Some progressive philosophical thinkers often used Buddhist ideas of resisting oppression to challenge feudal ethics and morality that shackled human nature. Some of them even angered the reactionary rulers of the time and lost their lives as a result. Li Zhuowu in the Ming Dynasty and Tan Sitong in the late Qing Dynasty are more prominent representatives. In Chinese history, sometimes under the violent aggression of foreign races, some patriotic people maintained the purity of their souls under the protection of Buddhism. Such facts are too numerous to mention.

Sakyamuni and his thoughts are very familiar and very close to the hearts of the Chinese people. The reason why the Chinese people feel familiar and close to him is primarily because the concepts of equality and the ideas of peace advocated by Sakyamuni not only reflect the wishes of the Indian people, but also conform to the fine traditions of the Chinese people. These common fine traditions of the two great nations are the ideological foundation for establishing the moral friendship between the two great nations.

The Chinese and Indian nations have jointly experienced a glorious path, and in the past hundred years, they have both suffered from enemy aggression. Today, they have both achieved independence and freedom along their own paths. Our two great nations have experienced vicissitudes and have seen with our own eyes how many tyrants have vainly attempted to replace equality with oppression and peace with slaughter. However, they have failed and will continue to fail. The Chinese and Indian nations, holding high the banner of equality and peace, stand tall in the world, unite with the progressive people who love peace all over the world, and become an important force for peace in Asia and even the whole world.

Today, as we commemorate the 2500th anniversary of Sakyamuni's Nirvana, we not only cherish the traditional friendship between our two great nations, but we also want to move towards a broader future. The true inheritors of China's fine culture—the Chinese working class—have promoted and developed this fine tradition on the original basis. Today, we have basically eliminated the system of oppression and exploitation that has threatened the people the most for thousands of years, and we are using the strength of 600 million people to defend peace. The fine traditions of the Chinese nation in the past are no longer confined to the stage of thought, but have become the political line of 600 million people. The Indian nation is also moving forward on the basis of its victory. The "Panchsheel" advocated by the Chinese and Indian nations has been recognized by peace-loving people all over the world. In today's situation of people's victory, it is our current task to develop more friendly, closer, and more solid cooperation in economy and culture. It is hoped that the people of our two great nations will further make better and greater contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    纪念释迦牟尼?槃二千五百周年
    汤用彤　任继愈
    中印两大民族的友谊是悠久的、深厚的、诚挚的。我们这两大民族的历史记载中，只有亲善和友好，从来没有战争的记录，这在世界文化史上是十分珍贵的现象。这两个古老而年青的民族中间隔着高山、荒漠和大海，可是高山、荒漠和大海并没有阻断两大民族之间的传统友谊。使这两大民族相互了解，彼此尊重的重要桥梁之一是伟大的释迦牟尼和他所创立的佛教。
    关于释迦牟尼的生平和他的思想，中国人民是十分熟悉的。对他熟悉的程度就像我们熟悉自己民族的伟大思想家一样。释迦牟尼的教义曾翻成中国汉、藏各种文字。就以译成汉文的关于释迦牟尼的记载，收集在大藏经中的就不下几十种。最重要的有“普曜经”、“佛所行赞”、“太子瑞应本起经”、“菩萨本起经”、“慧业菩萨问大善权经”、“十二游经”、“佛本行经”等等，此外，散见于“阿含经”和律藏中的关于释迦牟尼生平活动的记载也很多，最详尽的有六十卷的“佛本行集经”。释迦牟尼经历了几十年的辛勤的传教生活，其影响是很巨大的。记载佛涅槃的著作，中译本现存重要的有“游行经”、“佛般泥垣经”、“大般涅槃经”、“佛垂般涅槃略说教诫经”等。据记载，佛涅槃时的姿势是“右胁而卧”，慈爱地、安详地离开了人间。中国各省都有不少的卧佛的造像和壁画，以“卧佛寺”命名的庙宇也几乎各地都有。可见中国人民对佛涅槃这件大事的重视的态度和纪念的诚挚。
    中国学者们关于释迦牟尼的传记著作也很多。其中重要的、较早的有梁朝僧佑的“释迦谱”、隋朝费长房的“历代三宝记”、唐朝道宣的“释迦氏谱”、宋朝志磐的“佛祖统纪”。宋以后关于释迦牟尼传记的著作历代都有，这里不必细说。
    在所有这些古代中、印的著作中，不免有些夸大，记载也有些分歧，但这些著作中都透露出了释迦牟尼的真实形象。从佛教的各种记载中，我们看出释迦牟尼怎样地舍弃了个人的王位，追求他的崇高理想。他痛斥那些专横的剥削者；他无情地攻击那些贪财、自私、伪善的宗教信奉者；他同情那些被践踏、被轻视的所谓下等阶级的奴隶、穷人、负债者、妇女和无依无靠的儿童。他在最基本教义里规定了反对暴力和战争。释迦牟尼以他一生的艰苦卓绝的实践，履行了他的宣扬人人平等、爱好和平的信念。他所收纳的弟子中，固然不拒绝那些肯于抛弃富贵的贵族、富商；但是他也收纳了当时最“低贱”的首陀族优婆离；他也收纳了当时被排斥于宗教门外的女子摩呵波暗波提。释迦牟尼和他创立的佛教，一开始就立下了弘大的誓愿：宣扬平等、反对等级压迫；爱好和平，反对残暴的战争。他之所以获得广大的、特别是下层人民的拥戴，被看做“救世真主”，不是偶然的。
    中国人民和印度人民一样，也是具有几千年的文化传统，也是一贯反对压迫、爱好和平的。在历史上为我们人民所喜爱、所拥护的文学家和哲学家，几乎没有一个不是反对暴力压迫，反对侵略战争的。
    由于中印两大民族有这种基本共同的优良传统，所以中印文化的交流好像水乳相融，没有窒碍。只要我们略一回溯一下两大民族文化交往的历史，就会更加增强了我们两大民族今后继续合作的信心。
    从汉代开始即有印度僧人迦叶竺摩腾、竺法兰介绍了四十二章经到中国来，此后历代都有大量的印度学者介绍印度学术到中国来，这些例子是举不完的。中国晋代的法显、唐代的玄奘、义净，还有许许多多为中国人民所敬重的求法者，他们为了介绍佛经，不惜犯风涛，涉重洋，历荒漠、经绝域，九死一生，孤行万里。他们在印度的学习和访问，曾给印度人民留下了良好深刻的印象。他们的著作中，像“佛国记”、“大唐西域记”、“南海寄归内法传”到今天仍然是研究印度四世纪到七世纪时期重要原始资料。这些事实都是全世界的科学工作者所熟悉的。
    中印两大民族文化合作的珍贵记录，莫过于佛经的翻译工作。佛经翻译的工作，一方面促进了中印两大民族的了解，另方面树立了国际学者通力合作、互相帮助的良好榜样。中国流行的佛教经典，很少不是通过中印两国的学者专家共同努力而完成的。翻译时有“译主”、“笔受”、“证义”、“润文”、“正字”等各种分工。随着翻译的进行，同时展开讲解、讨论。他们认真讨论，反复钻研，最后定稿的严格制度，翻译与研究相结合的精神，直到今天还值得我们学习，其中的经验值得我们吸取。
    中印文化的因缘，还有值得我们特别指出的，就是大藏经的刊印。远在十世纪末，宋太祖开宝年间，中国开始以雕板印行佛教以及佛教有关的丛书——大藏经。此后，经过元、明、清各朝都有所增补。现在“大藏经”和“续藏经”所收集的经典著作在三千六百部以上，共达一万五千六百余卷之多。个别的著作，没有收集的还不在内。在“大藏经”里面保存着今天在印度已经失传的许多佛教经典，也包括了中国学者对于佛教原理所作的创造性的阐明。这一部有历史意义的大丛书，本身就是千余年来，中印双方友好合作、文化交流的最忠实的证人。
    随着释迦牟尼的思想和佛教的传播，曾使得中印两国古代文化更加丰富多采了。中国古代的雕刻、音乐、文学、数学、医学各方面都留下了中印合作、文化交流的痕迹。这些也是一时说不完的。其中就以艺术、文学来说，南北朝以后的文学家经常不断地从佛教经典中吸取其有价值的东西。佛经中的故事在相当长时期内成为艺术家们绘画的题材。中国大艺术家顾恺之、吴道子都是以画佛经中动人的故事而为中国人民所喜爱的。佛教经典中的文学作品也曾经深深地感动了中国历代天才的文学家。佛教经典某些作品中所充满的那种浓烈奔放的情感和摆脱羁绊的幻想，曾在不同程度上开拓了中国文学家的眼界，丰富了创作的内容。
    在哲学思想方面，释迦牟尼的学说曾在中国人民中间起过巨大的影响。不容否认，历代的反动统治阶级经常利用佛教作为满足他们自私目的的工具，这只是问题一方面；另方面，中国思想界中曾有不少人士，结合佛教中宣扬平等、爱好和平的精神，向封建专制主义进行斗争。有些进步的哲学思想家经常利用佛教的反抗压迫的思想，向桎梏人性的封建伦理道德挑战，其中有些人，甚至触怒了当时的反动统治者，因而丧失了性命。像明代的李卓吾、清末的谭嗣同就是较为突出的代表人物。中国历史上，有时候在异族的暴力侵略下，有些爱国人士在佛教的掩护下保持住他们灵魂的纯洁。像这些事实更是指不胜屈。
    释迦牟尼和他的思想，在中国人民的心里是非常熟悉、非常亲切的。中国人民对他之所以感到熟悉、亲切，首先是由于释迦牟尼所宣扬的平等观念、和平思想不仅体现了印度人民的愿望，它也符合于中国人民的优良传统。这两大民族的共有的优良传统，就是建立两大民族的道义之交的思想基础。
    中印两大民族，曾共同经历了光辉的道路，近百年来又都遭受过敌人的侵略，今天又各自沿着自己的道路取得了独立、自由。我们两大民族历经沧桑，亲眼看到多少强暴者曾妄想以压迫代替平等，以屠杀代替和平，但是，他们已经失败了，并且还将继续失败下去。中印两大民族高举着平等、和平的大旗，屹立在天壤间，和全世界爱好和平的进步人民团结一致，成为亚洲乃至全世界的和平的重要力量。
    今天我们纪念释迦牟尼涅槃二千五百周年，不但珍视我们两大民族的传统友谊，我们还要向着更广阔的前途迈进。中国优良文化的真正继承者——中国的工人阶级已经把这种优良传统在原有的基础上给以发扬光大。我们今天基本上消灭了几千年来对人民威胁最大的压迫和剥削制度，我们以六亿人民的力量在保卫和平。中华民族过去的优良传统已不再停留在思想阶段，它已成为六亿人民的政治路线。印度民族也在他的胜利的基础上向前迈进。中印两大民族倡议的“潘查希拉”，已为全世界爱好和平的人民所公认。在今天人民胜利的情况下，展开经济、文化上更友好、更亲密、更巩固的合作，是我们当前的任务。希望我们两大民族的人民进一步为亚洲和世界的和平事业做出更好、更多的贡献。
