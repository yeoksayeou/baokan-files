　　This dispatch from Mangshi: The one hundred and twenty direct transition agricultural cooperatives piloted in the Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Dehong, Yunnan Province, in the Jingpo, Lisu, Benglong, and parts of Han areas with a population of 140,000, have improved their management level, and more than 95% of the cooperatives have increased their output.
    This year, in order to help the ethnic minorities improve their production, the local Party and People's Government not only widely promoted production measures such as reasonable close planting, land reclamation, fertilizer accumulation, and the development of diversified operations according to local conditions in these cooperatives, but also provided free relief funds of 150,000 yuan, which basically overcame the difficulties faced by farmers due to the lack of food rations, seeds, and draught animals. Cooperative members had more time to devote to field labor. However, in these areas, a strong sense of egalitarianism and collective work existed in people's minds, and the socialist distribution principle of "to each according to his work" was regarded as immoral behavior. At the same time, there was also a lack of a concept of numbers. Implementing socialist management in agricultural cooperatives encountered many difficulties. In order to adapt to the characteristics of the ethnic groups, agricultural cooperatives generally adopted the method of equally evaluating work points regardless of gender, age, or labor power in labor organization and work point recording. When working, everyone would swarm together, resulting in very low production efficiency. Later, using examples of real people and real events and using a comparative approach, patient education was carried out, which gradually made the cooperative members understand the principle of more work, more gain. On the basis of the cooperative members' willingness, the egalitarian management method was gradually changed. Now, most cooperatives can freely combine to form labor groups and contract work by the piece, with work points recorded separately. After the management level of the cooperatives improved, it encouraged the enthusiasm of the cooperative members for labor. After the Banwa Agricultural Cooperative in Longchuan County implemented the method of contracting work by the piece, the cooperative members of each labor group competed to go to the fields before dawn. Due to the universal increase in production in the agricultural cooperatives, the income of the cooperative members also increased significantly, and people's mental outlook has also changed to varying degrees. The superstitious ideas of slaughtering livestock to worship ghosts and "relying on ghosts for food" have gradually been broken. Generally, cooperative cadres have established the concept of relying on labor to increase production. Some agricultural cooperatives in Longchuan County only slaughtered one cow every six months; the Mansa Agricultural Cooperative in Yingjiang County has not slaughtered a cow in three years.

　　德宏傣族?颇族自治州试办的直接过渡的农业社
　　经营管理水平提高产量增加
　  社员逐渐了解多劳多得的道理，克服了平均主义思想
    本报芒市9日电　云南省德宏傣族?颇族自治州在十四万人口的?颇、傈僳、崩龙及部分汉族地区试办的一百二十个直接过渡的农业社，提高了经营管理水平，95％以上的社增加了产量。
    今年当地党和人民政府为了帮助各少数民族搞好生产，除在这些社里普遍推广了合理密植、开荒、积肥和因地制宜发展多种经营等生产措施以外，还无偿地发放了救济款十五万元，基本上克服了农民缺少口粮、籽种、耕畜的困难，社员们有了更多的时间可以从事田间劳动。可是，在这些地区，人们意识里存在着浓厚的平均主义和伙干的思想，把按劳取酬的社会主义分配原则看成是不道德的行为。同时，也缺少数字观念。在农业社中实行社会主义的经营管理，遇到了很多困难。他们为了适应民族特点，农业社在劳动组织和评工记分中，一般采取不分男女老少平均评工记分的办法，做起活来也是“一窝蜂”，生产效率很低。后来，以活人活事作例子，用对比的方式进行了耐心的教育，使社员逐渐懂得了多劳多得的道理。在社员自愿的基础上，逐渐改变了平均主义的管理方式。现在，一般社都能作到自由结合成立劳动小组和按件包工、分别记分。社的管理水平提高了以后，鼓励了社员的劳动热情。陇川县班瓦农业社实行了按件包工的办法以后，天不亮各劳动小组的社员就争先下田了。由于农业社普遍增产，社员收入也增加了很多，人们的精神面貌也有了不同程度的改变。杀牲祭鬼、“靠鬼吃饭”的迷信观念逐渐破除，一般社干部都树立了增加生产靠劳动的观念。陇川县有些农业社半年只杀一头牛；盈江县蛮撒农业社三年没杀过一头牛。
