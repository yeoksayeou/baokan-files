　　Shiwan Pottery
　　Shiwan in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, has been famous for producing pottery since the Song Dynasty. Now, some of the Shiwan pottery manufacturers have become joint state-private enterprises, and some have joined cooperatives. At present, they are producing large quantities of industrial water cylinders, sulfuric acid tanks, chemical tools, electrical appliances, roof tiles for construction, and various pottery sculptures. Among these, the pottery sculptures of figures, birds, and animals are the best, with exquisite craftsmanship and lifelike expressions. The picture shows excellent artisans creating new ceramic sculptures at the ceramic carving workshop established by the Guangzhou People's Fine Arts Society in Shiwan.

　　石湾陶器
　　广东省南海县的石湾，远在宋代就以出产陶器著名。现在，石湾陶器制造业有的公私合营了，有的参加了合作社。目前正大量制造工业用的水筒、硫酸罐、化学工具、电器用具、建筑用的陶瓦和各种陶塑等。其中尤以陶塑人物鸟兽最佳，手工精巧，神态毕肖。图为广州人民美术社在石湾设立的陶瓷雕刻工场里，优秀的艺人进行新的陶瓷雕塑创作。
