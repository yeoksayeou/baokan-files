Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 25th. Delegations from the Central Committees of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia held talks in Prague from December 9th to 10th. After the talks, the leading bodies of the two parties discussed and approved the results of the meeting and issued a joint statement on December 20th.

The statement said that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia believe that fraternal cooperation among socialist countries led by the Soviet Union is a prerequisite for the smooth progress of socialist construction and the struggle for peace. The close relationship between socialist countries, based on the Leninist principles of socialist internationalism and complete equality, as well as economic, political and cultural cooperation, is now of increasing significance. This relationship has already been established between the German Democratic Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic. The interests of both countries require vigilant prevention of enemies from infringing upon the friendly relations between the two countries and the continuous development of this relationship.

The statement then said that current events prove the correctness of the assessment made by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that the balance of world forces has become greatly favorable to peace, democracy, and socialism. Imperialist and reactionary forces want to create a gap between socialist countries and other countries in the vast peace zone, but this idea has not succeeded.

The statement said: “The defeat of the imperialist attack on the freedom and independence of Egypt proves the above point. The aggression against Egypt once again shows the people of the world that imperialism threatens world peace. This prompts all progressive forces to be more vigilant and to unite more closely in the struggle against the bellicose imperialist blocs.

The statement then said that the existence of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the associated remilitarization of West Germany, as well as the persecution of honest peace fighters and the banning of the German Communist Party in West Germany, are a serious threat to peace in Europe and, therefore, to the peaceful socialist construction of our two countries.

The statement emphasized that the Warsaw Pact of socialist countries is a powerful fortress against the insidious attempts of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc of nations. Germany and Czechoslovakia will continue to thoroughly implement the Warsaw Pact.

The statement said that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia advocate eliminating all forms of the "Cold War" and easing international tensions, and believe that the Soviet government's statement of November 17 this year on disarmament and easing international tensions is the most appropriate basis for joint action by all peace-loving people.

The statement said that the subversive activities of counter-revolutionaries in the People's Democratic Republic of Hungary are part of a broad conspiracy by world reactionaries against socialist, democratic, and peaceful forces. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia support the Soviet Union's action, at the request of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, to provide strong assistance in defeating fascist bandits. The victory over counter-revolution is in the interests of world peace. We once again assure the working class and all working people of Hungary that they will receive our full understanding and assistance in order to quickly overcome the current difficulties. The statement also emphasized that it is necessary to learn from the Hungarian events, raise the political and ideological vigilance of our party and all party members, in order to promptly defeat the enemy's attempts.

The statement then said: We welcome the fruitful efforts of the Polish United Workers' Party to ensure the further socialist construction of our neighboring country - People's Poland. We are willing to help them overcome existing economic and other difficulties through comprehensive friendly cooperation with Polish comrades, and to contribute to defeating the attempts of domestic and foreign reactionary forces to weaken Poland's international position and undermine the peaceful development of Europe.

The statement said that the two parties most severely condemn any attempt to weaken the solidarity of socialist countries and undermine the relations between the people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union. The two parties expressed their firm determination: never to allow the violation of the principles of proletarian internationalism, and are determined to fight against all nationalistic and anti-Soviet tendencies. The unity of the socialist world system relies primarily on the unity of the communist parties and workers of all countries and their joint action on all domestic and international policy issues. The socialist world system can only be consolidated on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. All clichés about so-called "national communism" are contrary to Marxism-Leninism. Our two parties agree that the unity of the entire world communist movement is indispensable. It is necessary to jointly deal with the provocations of imperialism and the anti-socialist actions of opportunists and all forms of degeneration in the workers' movement. Our party firmly opposes all attempts to divide the Marxist workers' movement with divisions such as "Stalinists" and "de-Stalinists," "old" and "new" directions. These terms come from the arsenal of imperialist propaganda.

The statement concluded by saying that our two parties, proceeding from the principles of proletarian internationalism, will continue to comprehensively develop fraternal relations with each other in all fields. The fraternal alliance and close cooperation between the German and Czech people are a great force in the struggle to win the victory of socialist construction in our two countries, and contribute to the consolidation and strengthening of the entire socialist world system and world peace.

    德捷两党代表团发表会谈联合声明
    继续在一切领域里全面发展两党兄弟关系
    谴责分裂社会主义国家团结和反苏的倾向
    新华社柏林25日电　德国统一社会党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会代表团12月9日到10日在布拉格举行了会谈。会谈结束后，两党的领导机构分别讨论和批准了这次会谈的结果并且于12月20日发表了联合声明。
    声明说，德国统一社会党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党认为，以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的兄弟合作是顺利进行社会主义建设和争取和平的斗争的先决条件。以列宁的社会主义国际主义原则和完全平等以及经济、政治和文化合作为基础的社会主义国家之间的紧密关系现在已经具有越来越大的意义。这种关系在德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国之间已经建立起来了。两国的利益要求警惕地防止敌人侵犯两国之间的友好关系和不断发展这种关系。
    声明接着说，目前所发生的事件证明苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所做的世界力量的对比变得大大有利于和平、民主和社会主义这一估计的正确性。帝国主义和反动势力想在社会主义国家与广大的和平地区的其他国家之间造成一道鸿沟，但是这种想法并没有得逞。
    声明说：“帝国主义对埃及的自由和独立的进攻的被击败就证明了上述一点。对埃及的侵略向全世界人民再一次表明：帝国主义威胁着世界和平。这就促使所有进步的力量必须更加提高警惕，并且在反对好战的帝国主义集团的斗争中更加紧密地团结起来。
    声明接着说，侵略性的北大西洋公约组织的存在和与此相联系的西德重新军国主义化以及对正直的和平战士的迫害和在西德禁止德国共产党，是对欧洲和平的严重威胁，因而也是对我们两国和平的社会主义建设事业的威胁。
    声明强调指出，社会主义国家的华沙条约是对付北大西洋侵略集团国家的阴险企图的强大堡垒。德捷两国将继续彻底执行华沙条约。
    声明说，德国统一社会党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党主张消除任何形式的“冷战”，主张缓和国际紧张局势，并且认为苏联政府今年11月17日发表的关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势的声明是所有爱好和平的人士共同行动的最适当的基础。
    声明说反革命分子在人民民主匈牙利的颠复活动，是世界反动派对社会主义、民主和和平力量发动的广泛阴谋的一部分。德国统一社会党和捷克斯洛伐克共产党支持苏联应匈牙利工农革命政府的请求对击溃法西斯匪徒给予有力协助的行动。对反革命的胜利是符合全世界的和平利益的。我们再一次向匈牙利的工人阶级和全体劳动人民保证，他们将获得我们的充分谅解和援助，以便迅速地克服目前的困难。声明还强调指出，有必要从匈牙利事件中吸取教训，提高我们的党和所有党员的政治和思想警惕性，以便及时地击破敌人的企图。
    声明接着说：我们欢迎波兰统一工人党为保障我们的邻国——人民波兰的进一步社会主义建设而做的有成效的努力。我们愿意通过同波兰同志们的全面的友好合作来帮助他们克服现有的经济的和其他的困难，并且为击败国内和国外反动势力要削弱波兰的国际地位和破坏欧洲和平发展的企图而作出贡献。
    声明说，两党最严厉地谴责削弱社会主义国家的团结、破坏各人民民主国家同苏联之间的关系的任何企图。两党表示坚决的决心：绝不允许侵犯无产阶级国际主义的原则，并且决心对所有民族主义和反苏的倾向进行斗争。社会主义世界体系的团结一致，首先依靠各国共产党和工人的团结和他们在所有对内和国际政策问题上的共同行动。社会主义的世界体系只有在马克思列宁主义的基础上才能获得巩固。所有关于所谓“民族共产主义”的滥调都是违反马克思列宁主义的。我们两党一致认为，整个世界共产主义运动的团结是不可缺少的。有必要共同地对付帝国主义的挑衅和对付机会主义者及工人运动中一切形式的蜕化分子反社会主义的行动。我们的党坚决反对所有以“斯大林主义者”和“非斯大林主义者”、以“旧的”和“新的”方向的划分来分裂马克思主义工人运动的企图。这些词汇的来源是帝国主义宣传的武器库。
    声明最后说，我们两党将从无产阶级国际主义的原则出发，继续在一切领域里全面地发展相互间的兄弟关系。德捷人民的兄弟联盟和紧密合作就是在争取我们两国社会主义建设的胜利斗争中的巨大力量，并且有助于整个社会主义世界体系的巩固和加强世界和平。
