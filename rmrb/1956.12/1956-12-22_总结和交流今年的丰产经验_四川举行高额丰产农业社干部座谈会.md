Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 21st. More than 20 cadres from fourteen agricultural cooperatives in Sichuan Province that have achieved high yields recently held a symposium in Chengdu to summarize and exchange experiences in achieving abundant harvests.

These fourteen agricultural cooperatives are located in more than ten counties in the plains, hills, and mountainous areas, and have achieved high yields of crops such as rice, corn, sugarcane, and cotton. At the symposium, the cadres of each cooperative introduced in detail the specific conditions and farming methods of their cooperatives, which aroused great interest among everyone. The Heping First Agricultural Cooperative of Tuanjie Township, Pixian County, in the Sichuan West Plain, adopted advanced cultivation techniques such as using improved varieties, appropriate close planting, and rational fertilization. As a result, 5.4 mu of double-cropping rice yielded more than 5,634 jin, an average of more than 1,043 jin per mu. This fact broke the notion that the frost-free period in the Sichuan West Plain is too short to grow double-cropping rice, and even if it is grown, it cannot achieve a good harvest. The Shunjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Neijiang County, located in the hilly area, seized the season and promoted more than ten advanced cultivation techniques according to local conditions. As a result, more than 1,000 mu of grain crops yielded 973 jin per mu, and 40 mu of improved sugarcane varieties yielded 20,000 jin per mu. The Yihe First Agricultural Cooperative in Wusheng County is located in a mountainous area. The cooperative members used intercropping and overlapping methods to change 5.6 mu of land from three crops a year to five crops a year, with an average annual grain yield of 1,910 jin per mu. The Qianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Shehong County harvested an average of 102.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu on 372.17 mu of cotton fields, more than double the usual yield in the province. The Yingxin Agricultural Cooperative in Yuanming Township, Baxian County, and the Xinhua First Agricultural Cooperative in Nanlong Township, Nanbu County, have both become grain cooperatives with yields over 1,000 jin per mu.

At the symposium, the cadres of each cooperative also exchanged experiences in business management.

At present, in some rural areas of Sichuan Province, there is a phenomenon of blindly shouting that advanced experiences are not good and that there is insufficient enthusiasm for production. This symposium of high-yield cooperative cadres was convened by the Rural Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in response to this situation. Li Jingquan, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, also participated in the symposium and studied the experiences of abundant harvests with the cadres of each cooperative.

    总结和交流今年的丰产经验
    四川举行高额丰产农业社干部座谈会
    新华社成都21日电　四川省获得高额丰产成绩的十四个农业社，有二十多名干部最近在成都市座谈，总结和交流了丰产经验。
    这十四个农业社分别处在平原、丘陵和山区的十多个县，分别创造了水稻、玉米、甘蔗、棉花等作物的高额产量。座谈会上，各社的干部都详细地介绍了社里的具体条件和耕作方法，大家都感到很大的兴趣。川西平原上郫县团结乡和平第一农业社由于推行采用良种、适当密植，合理施肥等先进耕作技术，有五点四亩双季稻收获五千六百三十四斤多，平均每亩一千零四十三斤多。这一事实打破了川西平原无霜期短不能种双季稻，即使种了也不能丰收的看法。位于丘陵区的内江县顺江农业社，社员们抓紧季节，因地制宜地推行了十多种先进耕作技术，结果使一千多亩粮食作物每亩收获九百七十三斤，四十亩良种甘蔗每亩收获两万斤。武胜县义和第一农业社地处山区，社员们采用间种、套种的方法，把五点六亩地一年三熟改为一年五熟，平均每亩全年产粮食一千九百一十斤。射洪县前锋农业社在三百七十二点一七亩棉田内平均每亩收获皮棉一百零二斤半，比省内通常产量高出一倍以上。巴县园明乡迎新农业社和南部县南隆乡新华第一农业社都成了粮食千斤社。
    座谈会上，各社的干部还交流了经营管理方面的经验。
    目前四川省某些地区的农村中，发生盲目叫喊先进经验不好和生产劲头不足的情况。这次高额丰产社干部座谈会就是针对这种情况，由中共四川省委员会农村工作部召开的，省委第一书记李井泉也参加座谈会，和各社的干部一起研究了丰产经验。
