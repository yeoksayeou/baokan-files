What Kind of "Going Deep Among the Masses" Is This?
    Wei Lan

    Not long ago, I went to visit a famous agricultural cooperative in Hebei, and happened to meet a leading comrade from the local district committee who had come with several key cadres to summarize the cooperative's experience in increasing production over the past year. I was extremely happy, as I would be able to work in the cooperative with a leading comrade, giving me a rare opportunity to learn their methods of working deeply among the masses and observing problems.

    Their methods of working and observing problems truly gave me a profound "education."

    How did they go deep among the masses? To tell the truth, it astonished me. Apart from a few times when the kind landlord brought some things they considered delicious and the work team comrades had to give the necessary greetings, I did not see them talk to a single cooperative member. In the courtyard where they lived, there was a production team headquarters. At night, the team headquarters would be noisy until midnight, discussing work and evaluating labor. More than ten days passed, and this work team, headed by the leading comrade from the district committee, never once went to observe how the team was working, even though it was right next door. Wasn't this a rare occasion and opportunity to discover problems? Why didn't they make good use of it? The work team's nearly 20,000-word summary of experience was about to be completed. Where did the materials and experience come from?

    It turned out that their method was as follows: the leading comrade from the district committee would sit on the heated brick bed and come up with topics, and the work team comrades would then go and collect materials separately. After collecting the materials, they would return to the room to report and organize them. It might be acceptable to work like this to specifically study a certain problem. But who did they collect the materials from? I asked one of the comrades. He said: "We collected them from the cooperative cadres; because we are summarizing the cooperative's grand experience, unlike you who only pay attention to small aspects." His answer truly astonished me. I knew many of the problems in the cooperative and the members' opinions and demands. I had also seen the work team's summary materials. I didn't understand how these empty theories that did not reflect the members' opinions, which had been preconceived, could be called "grand experience;" nor did I understand why summarizing "grand experience" only required finding the cooperative cadres, and didn't require finding the members.

    Once, I eavesdropped on a cooperative cadre talking about "materials" to a comrade from the work team. How did they collect materials from the cooperative cadres? A comrade from the work team (a director from the district committee), in order to summarize the contrast between the past and present lives in the cooperative, specifically gathered several cooperative cadres to talk.

    He asked: "Wasn't life here very hard in the past? How hard was it?"

    Several people answered in unison: "It was very hard."

    Because everyone's conversation was very vague, he prompted them: "For example, you are near the sea here, so there must be a lot of alkaline wasteland, and the masses' lives would naturally be such that they were barely clothed and didn't have enough to eat,..."

    Again, several people answered in unison: "Yes, yes, that's how it was, very hard."

    He quickly wrote it down in his notebook and said: "For example, were the masses not forced to flee famine? Did they not live on bran and vegetables for half the year?..."

    Again, everyone answered in unison: "That's how it was, we lived that kind of life."

    He asked again: "Can you give a few typical examples, for example, who lived that kind of life in the past, and whose current life is like heaven compared to the past..."

    Everyone answered in unison: "There are such families..."

    When the person asking the questions wrote down his own words, I realized how different the two sides' thoughts were. The person asking the questions only wanted to "pass" his own words, while the people answering only hoped to deal with it quickly. I knew that the serious contradiction between teams and brigades in the autumn harvest distribution was waiting for these cadres to find a solution. As soon as the questioner announced: "Let's stop here!" they immediately ran out in a puff of smoke.

    In the work team's lengthy summary, the experience of democratic management of the cooperative was given a considerable place. Among them, there were two important points: one was that members verbally offered suggestions, improving the cooperative's work; the other was that the cooperative set up suggestion boxes to solicit members' opinions. This aspect of experience and materials was exactly what I needed, so I further inquired about the facts cited in the summary. What were the facts? Regarding the first point, in reality, only one activist had made a suggestion once, and no one else had ever made a second suggestion. Regarding the second point, according to my understanding, only a few teams out of dozens had set up suggestion boxes in the spring of this year; initially, some people had written opinions and put them in, but later no one ever wrote opinions again. I specifically went to see a team's suggestion box, and it was already broken and dilapidated, facing the wall, standing there blankly.

    The work team drew the conclusion that "the policy of democratic cooperative management has been implemented very well" based on these facts. What kind of conclusion is this? How should we summarize experience? Is it enough for those who summarize experience to simply collect such materials or similar materials to prove the "conclusion" that they had already "confidently planned?"

    Soon, this work team completed their task, and carried the cooperative's "one-year experience summary" back; it is said that they will vigorously promote this cooperative's experience. This could not help but astonish me. As far as I know, the cadres and members here are not clear about what experiences and lessons they have had this year! Because they are very busy, they have not had time to thoroughly discuss what experiences they have had this year.

    Then whose experience is the "experience summary" that the work team carried back? Summarizing the experience of the masses, but not relying on the masses, and not raising the ideological level of the people who created these experiences in the process of summarizing experience, isn't that a strange thing?

    What good is it to forcibly stamp your own "conclusions" with other people's seal?

    Coming out of the city office and "going deep" into the rural houses should certainly be considered going deep. However, what kind of "going deep" is it to not talk to the cooperative members after going down?

### 这是什么样的“深入群众”？

    这是什么样的“深入群众”？
    蔚蓝
    不久以前，我到河北一个有名的农业合作社去访问，恰好遇到一个地委负责同志带着几个主要干部到这儿来，总结这个社一年来的增产经验。我高兴极了，能同一个负责同志一起在社里工作，自己有机会学习他们在群众中深入工作和观察问题的方法，这机会太难得了。
    他们进行工作和观察问题的方法，确实给了我深刻的“教育”。
    他们是怎么深入群众的呢？说来真使我惊奇。除了有几次好心的房东送来一点他们自己认为是好吃的东西、工作组的同志必须给予必要的招呼以外，我没有看到他们同一个社员谈过话。在他们住的院子里，就有一个生产队的队部。晚上，队部里为讨论工作、为评工，一嚷就是半夜。十多天过去了，这个以地委负责同志为首的工作组，一次也没有就近去观察一下队里是如何工作的。这不是一个发现问题的难得的场合和机会吗？他们为什么不很好利用呢？工作组的约有两万字的经验总结就要完成了，材料和经验是哪儿来的呢？
    原来他们的作法是这样的：这位地委负责同志坐在炕头上出题目，由这几位工作组的同志分头去搜集材料。搜集之后，再回到房子里来汇报、整理。为了专门研究某一个问题，这样作未尝是不可以的。但他们的材料是向谁搜集的呢？我问了他们之中的一个同志。他说：“我们是向社干部搜集的；因为我们总结的是这个社的大经验，不像你那样只是注意一些小的方面。”他的回答真使我吃惊。我知道社里的不少问题和社员们的意见和要求，我也看过工作组的总结材料。我不明白，怎么可以说这些没有反映社员意见的预先想好的空洞道理，便是“大经验”；也不明白，为什么总结“大经验”只需要找社干部，而可以不必去找社员。
    有一次，我旁听了一下社干部向工作组的一个同志谈“材料”的过程。他们是怎样向社干部搜集材料的？工作组的一位同志（是地委的一位部长），为了总结这个社过去和现在生活对比的情况，特地召集了几个社干部来谈话。
    他问：“你们这里过去生活不是很苦吗？怎样苦法？”
    几个人一齐答：“是很苦。”
    因为大家谈的很不具体，他又提示说：“比如说，你们这里靠海，碱荒地一定很多，群众生活自然就会是衣不遮身，粮不糊口，……。”
    又是几个人一齐答：“对，对，就是这样，很苦。”
    他连忙写在记录本上，又说：“比如还有，群众能不逃荒在外吗？能不过糠菜半年粮的生活吗？……”
    又是一齐回答：“就是这样，是过的这样的生活。”
    又问：“你们能不能举几个典型例子，比如过去谁家是这样的日子，他们现在的日子和过去比较正是天上地下……”
    一齐回答：“有这样的人家。……”
    当问话的人把自己的话记下来的时候，我才发现双方的想法是多么不同。问的人只是想把自己的话“通过”一下，而答的人只是希望赶快对付过去。我知道，秋收分配中队和队之间的严重矛盾，正等着他们几个干部想办法解决哩。问话人一宣布：“就谈到这里吧！”他们马上一溜烟就跑出去了。
    在工作组的长篇大论的总结里，给了民主办社的经验一个相当的位置。其中有两点重要内容：一个是社员口头提建议，改进了社里的工作；一个是社里设了意见箱，征求社员的意见。这方面的经验和材料，正是我所需要的，我就进一步去了解总结中举出的事实。事实如何呢？关于第一点，实际只有一个积极分子提过一次建议，再没有第二个人提过第二次意见。关于第二点，据我了解，在好几十个队当中，只有几个队在今年开春设过意见箱；最初还有人写过意见投到里边，但是后来一直没有人再写意见了。我特地去看了一下一个队的意见箱，它已经破裂不堪，脸对着墙呆在那里。
    工作组就是根据这样一些事实，得出了“民主办社方针贯彻得很好”的结论。这是什么样的结论呢？究竟应该怎样来总结经验呢？是不是总结经验的人，只要搜集到这样的材料或类似的材料去证明他早已“胸有成竹”的“结论”就够了呢？
    不久，这个工作组完成了他们的任务，背起这个合作社的“一年经验总结”回去了；据说，将要大力推广这个社的经验。这又不能不使我吃惊。据我知道，这里的社干部和社员还不清楚他们自己这一年来到底有些什么经验教训呢！因为他们很忙，还没有来得及很好地讨论过一年来到底有哪些经验。
    那么工作组背回去的“经验总结”，究竟是谁的经验呢？总结群众的经验，而又不依靠群众，不在总结经验的过程中提高创造了这些经验的人们的思想水平，岂非怪事？
    把自己的“结论”硬盖上人家的图章，这种作法有什么好处呢？
    从城里的办公室里走出来，“深入”到农村的房子里，当然应该算是深入下去了。可是，下去之后仍然不同社员群众谈心，这是一种什么样的“深入”？
