    The Secretary-General of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the responsible comrades of the various departments and commissions of the Provincial Committee on December 13 to discuss and study the issue of comprehensively launching a campaign to increase production and practice economy in the organs of the Provincial Committee. After research, specific requirements were proposed for comprehensively increasing production and practicing economy:
      (1) Broadly conduct propaganda and education on increasing production and practicing economy among the staff of the organs, continue to promote the spirit of hard work and plain living, and the fine tradition of sharing weal and woe with the masses. For commodities that are temporarily in short supply on the market, staff should give priority to the masses in purchasing them. Surplus money should be saved more to support national industrial construction. Further carry out the advanced worker movement in the organs to improve work quality and work efficiency.
  (2) Strictly allocate housing in a unified manner according to prescribed standards. Preliminary statistics show that various departments and commissions can still squeeze out more than 300 square meters of office space and vacate more than 30 dormitory rooms.
  (3) Resolutely rectify staffing. First, the number of existing staff in each department and commission should be reduced to within the 1956 authorized size, and then further reorganization should be carried out.
  (4) Rationally use vehicles on the existing basis and overcome waste.
  (5) Save electricity. Dormitory light bulbs should uniformly be replaced with 15-watt bulbs, and lights should be turned off on time.

    中共贵州省委机关拟定增产节约措施
    中共贵州省委秘书长于12月13日召集省委各部、委负责同志，讨论研究在省委机关中全面开展增产节约运动的问题，经过研究提出了全面的增产节约的具体要求：
      （一）广泛地在机关工作人员中进行增产节约的宣传教育，继续发扬艰苦朴素作风和与群众共甘苦的优良传统。对市场上一时供应紧张的商品，工作人员应先让群众购买。余钱要多储蓄，以支持国家工业建设。进一步在机关中开展先进工作者运动，提高工作质量和工作效率。（二）严格按照规定标准，统一调配房屋。初步统计：各部委还可以挤出三百多平方公尺的办公室，腾出三十多间宿舍。（三）坚决整顿编制。首先把各部、委现有工作人员数紧缩到1956年度的编制数以内，然后再作进一步的整编。
  （四）在现有基础上合理使用汽车，克服浪费。（五）节约用电。宿舍灯泡一律规定换上十五支光的，并要按时熄灯。
