　　Serious Waste Phenomenon
　　I am a staff member preparing for the establishment of Suzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. On September 18th, I received a notice from the Suzhou Health Bureau, instructing me to take over all the buildings at 23 Xieyaqian Street, Suzhou, which were managed by the Suzhou Education Bureau on behalf of the Jiangsu Provincial Health Department as the "Jiangsu Provincial First Rehabilitation Hospital," for the purpose of establishing the Suzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. During the handover, both parties only relied on letters of introduction, and I didn't even receive a transfer record.
　　When I took over the buildings, I witnessed a serious waste of state property: Hundreds of hospital beds and all the furniture and equipment of the "Jiangsu Provincial First Rehabilitation Hospital" were allocated by the Jiangsu Provincial Health Department to relevant units in Northern Jiangsu, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Suzhou, and other regions. Even the sanitary equipment in the buildings, underground pipes, street lamp lines in the courtyard garden, sewage pipes, and all equipment of the artesian well for a four-story reinforced concrete water tower were included in the allocation. When I was in the process of taking over, the "Suzhou International Travel Service" was already pulling out the underground pipes, just like demolishing a building. The buildings were unattended for several months, and the internal damage was severe; doors and windows could not be closed. What is the reason for forcibly dismantling a perfectly complete hospital? Now, not only have the buildings been vacant for several months, and the interior has been damaged, but the equipment allocated and transported to various places requires a huge amount of freight, and some furniture and equipment may also be damaged. On the other hand, the preparation for the establishment of the "Suzhou Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital" requires an opening fee of 100,000 yuan, and the internal equipment cannot yet meet the hospital's requirements (even an X-ray machine cannot be obtained now). It would take two or three years of gradual equipping to restore the original state of the rehabilitation hospital. Therefore, I hope that relevant departments will investigate this damage and waste of state property, and I also hope that similar situations can be prevented in a timely manner in the future.

### 严重的浪费现象

　  严重的浪费现象
    我是筹备建立苏州市中医院的工作人员。9月18日我接到苏州市卫生局通知，要我去接管由江苏省卫生厅委托苏州市教育局代管的
  “江苏省第一康复医院”在苏州市谢衙前二十三号的全部房屋，作为苏州市中医院建院之用。接管时双方只凭介绍信，我连一本移交册子都没有拿到。
    我在接管该房屋时，看到一种严重浪费国家财产的现象：“江苏省第一康复医院”的几百只病床和医院的整个家具物品都由江苏省卫生厅调配给苏北、镇江、南京、苏州等地区有关单位，甚至连房子里的卫生设备、地下管子、院内园庭里的路灯线路、粪管子，以及一座高达四层楼的水泥钢筋水塔的自流井全部设备都属于调拨范围。当我正在接管时就有“苏州市国际旅行社”在拔地下管子，真是像拆房屋那样。房屋几个月无人照管，内部破漏的情况很严重，门窗都不能关闭。硬要把原来一个极完备的医院拆掉，是什么原因呢？现在不但房屋空关了几个月，内部已遭到了损坏，调拨运往各地的设备需要一笔巨大的运费，有的家具器械也可能有损坏。另一方面，筹建“苏州市中医院”需要十万元的开办费，而内部的设备也还不能达到医院的要求
  （现在连一架爱克斯光机也办不起来），要恢复康复医院的原状也得二、三年之久的逐步装备才能办到。因此，我希望有关部门对这种损害和浪费国家财产的事情进行检查，同时希望今后类似这种情况能够得到及时的制止。　鲍增元
