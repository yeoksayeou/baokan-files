　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th December: Many agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi province are re-threshing wheat straw that has already been threshed. In Yongshou County, seventy-nine agricultural cooperatives have obtained nearly 220,000 jin of wheat from wheat straw using methods such as rolling, sifting, and winnowing. The Fengguang Agricultural Cooperative in Feng County has cleaned out more than 3,300 jin of wheat from the remaining wheat bran and soil piles after distribution. Currently, some agricultural cooperatives in counties such as Baishui, Changwu, Jingyang, and Weinan are also carrying out this work.

　　During the summer wheat harvest in Shaanxi province this year, due to hasty harvesting in the rain and rough workmanship, much wheat was not thoroughly threshed or sifted, with wheat grains adhering to the straw or scattered on the ground. According to calculations by relevant authorities, if the province re-threshes and re-sifts the wheat straw and bran several times, it is estimated that over 66 million jin of wheat can be obtained. After the autumn harvest, some agricultural cooperatives in the province began to clean up this wheat. Initially, some cooperative members believed that doing so was "troublesome," "useless," and "not very profitable," but after education on detailed accounting, running the cooperative thriftily, and cherishing food, the work gradually unfolded. In late November, the Rural Work Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also deployed this work at a telephone conference for the secretaries of the prefectural and county committees across the province.

　　陕西许多农业社重打未收净的小麦
　  估计全省可收小麦六千六百多万斤
    新华社西安9日电　陕西省许多农业社正在重新翻打已经打过的麦秸。永寿县有七十九个农业社已从麦草中用碾、筛、簸等方法，得到小麦近二十二万斤。凤县凤光农业社从分配后剩下的麦糠和土堆里，清理出小麦三千三百多斤。现在，白水、长武、泾阳、渭南等县的一些农业社也在开展这一工作。
    陕西省在今年夏季麦收时，因为趁雨抢收做活粗糙等原因，使得许多小麦没有碾净、筛净，麦粒附着在麦草上，或撒落在地面上。据有关机关计算，全省如果把麦秸、麦糠等重打、重筛几遍，估计可以得到六千六百多万斤小麦。秋收完毕后，这个省的一些农业社就着手清理这些小麦。开始时，一些农业社社员曾认为这样做是“麻烦”、“不顶事”、“油水不大”等，但经过算细账、勤俭办社和爱惜粮食的教育后，工作逐渐展开。11月下旬，中共陕西省委农村工作部在全省地委、县委书记电话会议上，又布置了这一工作。
