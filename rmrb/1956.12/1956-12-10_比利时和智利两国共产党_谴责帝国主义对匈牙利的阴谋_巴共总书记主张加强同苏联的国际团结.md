Xinhua News Agency, December 7th dispatch from Brussels according to TASS: The Political Bureau of the Belgian Communist Party Central Committee published a statement in "Red Flag" newspaper stating: The working people have noticed that the significance of the Hungarian events and the Egyptian events are different, and their consequences are also different. Despite the wails and rumors of reactionaries and certain socialists, the working people are increasingly clearly understanding that socialism was threatened by Hungarian fascists who were supported by international reactionary forces.

On the other hand, the working masses unanimously condemn the Anglo-French imperialist aggression, which not only threatens the world but also brings great damage to the Belgian economy.

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th dispatch from Santiago: The Chilean newspaper "El Siglo" reported that the Central Committee of the Chilean Communist Party recently held a plenary session in Chile. The General Secretary of the Communist Party, Díaz, at the meeting condemned the imperialists' attempts to restore the landlord-capitalist regime in Hungary. When he talked about the Soviet Union's attitude towards the Hungarian events, he said: "The Soviet Union has adhered to the principle of non-interference in the past and present. However, this does not mean that it should stand idly by and watch the warmongers and international reactionaries carry out conspiracies. It cannot allow the imperialists to freely interfere in the affairs of other countries."

Xinhua News Agency, December 7th dispatch from Montevideo: The General Secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party, Prestes, recently wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Brazilian Communist Party, pointing out: The discussion of the issues raised by the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was welcomed by the entire Brazilian party, and the discussion of these issues is undoubtedly an important step in the party's development. However, it cannot be allowed to use newspapers to attack the Soviet Union under the guise of free discussion.

Prestes said that we are internationalists. We have close ties with the working people and the oppressed of all countries. Only by forming a close alliance with the invincible proletariat of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries can the Brazilian people's victorious struggle against imperialist oppression and the victory of the working class be possible. The cooperation between the Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of various countries does not exclude fraternal criticism between each other, but in criticism, one cannot forget an objective fact: the Soviet Union is the vanguard of the people of all countries fighting for peace, democracy, and socialism.

Prestes pointed out that in order to victoriously organize the people's struggle to free Brazil from the shackles of imperialism, it is necessary to unite the party and make all party members strive for unified action and for consciously abiding by iron discipline. Discussion must not be allowed to fall into open or hidden attacks on the party and its principles, which would lead to attempts to abolish the party.

    比利时和智利两国共产党
　　谴责帝国主义对匈牙利的阴谋
　  巴共总书记主张加强同苏联的国际团结
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社布鲁塞尔6日讯：比利时共产党中央政治局在“红旗报”上发表声明说：劳动人民注意到，匈牙利事件和埃及事件的意义是不同的，而且其后果也不一样。尽管反动分子和某些社会党人哀号和造谣，劳动人民还是日益清楚地了解：社会主义曾经受到那些得到国际反动势力支持的匈牙利法西斯分子的威胁。
    另一方面，劳动群众一致谴责英法帝国主义的侵略，这次侵略不仅使世界遭到威胁，而且给比利时的经济带来了巨大的损害。
    据新华社7日讯　圣地亚哥消息：智利“世纪报”报道，智利共产党中央委员会最近在智利举行了全体会议。共产党总书记迪亚斯在会上谴责帝国主义者想在匈牙利恢复地主—资本家政权的企图。他在谈到苏联对匈牙利事件的态度的时候说：“苏联在过去和现在都遵守不干涉的原则。但是，这并不是说，它应该袖手旁观，看着黩武主义者和国际反动派进行阴谋活动。它不能让帝国主义者自由地干涉其他国家的事务。
    据新华社7日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：巴西共产党总书记普列斯特斯最近写了一封信给巴西共产党中央委员会，指出：对苏联共产党第二十次代表大会所提出的问题的讨论受到了巴西全党的欢迎，就这些问题的讨论无疑是党发展道路上的一个重要步骤。但是，不能允许在自由讨论的借口下利用报纸来攻击苏联。
    普列斯特斯说，我们是国际主义者。我们同各国劳动人民和被压迫者有紧密的联系。只有同苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家不可战胜的无产阶级结成紧密的联盟，巴西人民反对帝国主义压迫的胜利斗争和工人阶级的胜利才是可能的。各国共产党和工人党的合作不排斥彼此间进行兄弟般的批评，但是在批评时不能忘记一个客观事实：苏联是为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的各国人民的先锋。
    普列斯特斯指出，为了胜利组织人民争取巴西摆脱帝国主义的桎梏的斗争，必须使党团结一致，使全体党员都一致为统一行动、为自觉遵守铁的纪律而努力。不能让讨论陷入对党和党的原则公开或隐藏的进攻，这种进攻会导致试图取消党。
