    New Generator Handed Over for Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 22nd. Just when the Northeast region is in great need of electricity, the second boiler and steam turbine generator of the Jilin Thermal Power Plant were handed over for production on the 17th.
    The Jilin Thermal Power Plant, which mainly supplies heat, is an electronic automatic control high-temperature and high-pressure thermal power plant. Its main equipment is supplied by the Soviet Union. High-temperature and high-pressure boilers are highly efficient, saving about 60% of standard coal compared to medium-temperature and medium-pressure boilers. In the operation of this type of boiler, water supply, coal supply, air supply, as well as temperature and pressure, are automatically adjusted by adjustment panels composed of electron tubes. This is more sensitive, accurate, rapid, and reliable than the electro-mechanical automatic adjustment commonly used in power plants across the country.

    新发电机移交生产
    据新华社吉林22日电　正当东北地区大量需要电力的时候，吉林热电厂的第二台锅炉和汽轮发电机，在17日移交生产了。
    以供热为主的吉林热电厂，是一座电子式自动控制的高温高压热电厂，它的主要设备是苏联供应的。高温高压锅炉效率高，比中温中压锅炉大约能节省标准煤60％。这种锅炉在运行中给水、给煤、给风以及温度和压力，由电子管组成的调整盘自动调整，比目前各地发电厂普遍采用的电气机械式自动调整更加灵敏、准确、迅速和可靠。
