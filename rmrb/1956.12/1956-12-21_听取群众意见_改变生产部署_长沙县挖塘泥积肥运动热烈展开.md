Listening to the Opinions of the Masses and Changing Production Plans
A Vigorous Campaign to Dig Pond Mud for Fertilizer Unfolds in Changsha County

(Our Dispatch) The Changsha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, under the unfavorable conditions caused by severe drought, changed its production deployment according to the demands of the masses, and a fertilizer accumulation upsurge quickly swept through the county's agricultural cooperatives.

Since the early rice harvest, Changsha County has not had a thorough rain for more than 180 days. Now the rural areas are experiencing dried-up water and ponds, and even drinking water is becoming difficult. Most of the paddy fields have not been plowed, and many of the few spring-harvest crops that have been planted have also dried up. However, not long ago, the Changsha County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party still arranged the sowing of spring-harvest crops, water conservancy construction, and fertilizer accumulation as the main content of winter production, layer by layer down the line, as it had in previous years. Due to the severity of the drought and the inability to sow seeds, the agricultural cooperatives treated the county committee's winter planting requirements with indifference, and many members were worried about next year's production.

In late November, after the county party secretary and most of the county committee members went deep into the rural areas, they quickly realized that the winter production content put forward by the county committee was not in line with reality. When the county party secretary was specifically studying with the members of the Qunli Agricultural Cooperative in Hexin Township, the members suggested to the county committee that the mobilization of the masses to carry pond mud should be the central task of winter production. The members analyzed that because of the drought and lack of water, green manure could not be planted, liquid manure could not be composted, and the paddy fields could not be winter-plowed. Certain agricultural tasks that could be done in winter in previous years could not be done. The only agricultural task that can be done now is digging pond mud. If fertilizer is not accumulated by digging pond mud now, not only will there be a serious shortage of fertilizer next spring, but also many things that should be done in winter will be squeezed into spring, and the labor force will definitely not be enough and spring plowing and production will also be poorly handled. The members believe that vigorously carrying pond mud now has four major benefits: First, the pond is dry now and the mud is easy to carry. Each load of dry pond mud can fertilize one mu of land, which saves six or seven working days compared to carrying wet pond mud; second, carrying pond mud can expand the water storage capacity of the pond, which is equivalent to building water conservancy; third, as long as a large amount of pond mud is accumulated, the fertilizer shortage of rice next year can be basically solved, and each mu of land can also save four or five yuan for the purchase of commercial fertilizer; fourth, if the fertilizer accumulation task is completed with all efforts this winter, people can be freed up to do other agricultural work next spring. After the county party secretary drew these valuable opinions from the masses, he immediately convened a meeting of the county committee for research. According to the reports of the county committee members who went to the countryside, the experienced veteran members of the agricultural cooperatives all had this requirement. Based on the actual situation, the county committee decided to list carrying pond mud to accumulate fertilizer as the central task of winter production.

This powerful call from the county party committee quickly aroused the production enthusiasm of the agricultural cooperative members throughout the county. The county's fertilizer accumulation campaign has gradually unfolded. The Qunli Agricultural Cooperative has 90% of its male labor force working to carry pond mud every day. The Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative originally had seventy-four members who went out to engage in sideline occupations because they could not plant in winter. When they learned that the whole cooperative was vigorously digging pond mud, seventy-three of them quickly returned. Four members of this cooperative who had previously claimed to withdraw from the cooperative, now see that there will be more fertilizer accumulated this year and there is hope for increased production next year, and they will not withdraw either. The Huanghua Agricultural Cooperative recently did the math, and they figured out that if they can apply a layer of pond mud to 70% of the paddy fields this year, they can save more than 10,000 yuan in production investment next year. Although this cooperative suffered disaster and reduced production this year, the old farmer Liu Yuqing still happily told reporters: "Now, as long as we seize the opportunity to carry pond mud, increased production next year is still guaranteed."

### 听取群众意见　改变生产部署  长沙县挖塘泥积肥运动热烈展开

    听取群众意见　改变生产部署
    长沙县挖塘泥积肥运动热烈展开
    本报讯　中共长沙县委会在严重的干旱所造成的不利条件下，根据群众的要求改变生产部署，全县农业社很快地掀起积肥热潮。
    长沙县早稻收割后到现在，有一百八十多天没有落过透雨，现在农村里水枯塘干，连吃水都感到困难，绝大部分稻田都没有翻耕，已种下的少数春收作物也干死很多。但是在不久以前，中共长沙县委还是照往年一样地把播种春收作物、兴修水利、积肥等作为冬季生产的主要内容层层向下布置。由于旱灾严重，无法播种，农业社对县委提出的冬种要求，都冷淡对待，很多社员对明年的生产担心。
    11月下旬，县委书记和大部分县委委员深入农村之后，很快地认识到县委提出的冬季生产内容是不切合实际的。县委书记在合心乡群力农业社和社员们具体研究的时候，社员们向县委建议：目前应该把发动群众挑塘泥，做为冬季生产的中心任务。社员们分析说：因为天旱无水，绿肥种不上，水粪沤不成，稻田不能冬耕，往年冬季能做的某些农活不能做，唯一能做的农活，便是挖塘泥。如果现在不挖塘泥积肥料，明春不但肥料要严重缺乏，而且许多冬季应该做的事，挤到春天来做，劳动力一定不够用，春耕生产也搞不好。社员们认为，现在大力挑塘泥有四大好处：一是现在塘干了，泥好挑，每挑能肥一亩田的干塘泥，比挑湿塘泥要节省六、七个劳动日；二是挑了塘泥可以扩大水塘的蓄水量，等于兴修了水利；三是只要积下大批塘泥，就可基本解决明年水稻的缺肥困难，每一亩田还可节省四、五元购买商品肥料的钱；四是今冬全力完成积肥任务，明年春天就可腾出人手来做其他农活。县委书记从群众中汲取了这些宝贵意见之后，立即召开县委会研究，据下乡的县委委员汇报，农业社里有经验的老社员都有这个要求。根据实际情况，县委便决定将挑塘泥积肥料列为冬季生产中心任务。
    县委这一有力的号召，迅速鼓起了全县农业社员的生产积极性。全县积肥运动已逐步展开。群力农业社每天有90％的男劳动力出工挑塘泥。先锋农业社本来有七十四名社员因不能冬种，外出搞副业，当他们知道全社大力挖塘泥的消息后，很快地就回来了七十三人。这个社原有四户声称要退社的社员，现在看到今年积肥多，明年增产有指望，也不退社了。黄花农业社社委会最近算个账，他们现在如果能把70％的稻田普遍施一道塘泥，明年就可节省生产投资一万多元。这个社今年虽然受灾减产，但老农民柳玉卿还是高兴地告诉记者：“现在只要抓住挑塘泥这一著棋，明年增产还是有保证的。”
