Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 27th: Cairo newspapers reported today that an Egyptian official spokesman announced on the 26th that Egypt would not hold negotiations with Britain and France on the Suez Canal issue. He said that Egypt would hold such negotiations directly with the United Nations.

The spokesman pointed out that Egypt would not forget what had happened in the past and would not directly discuss matters with the aggressors. He said that since Egypt had severed relations with them, it would even less do so.

The spokesman also announced that the Egyptian government had reached an agreement with United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on several issues and the basis for clearing the canal.

"People's News" published an editorial today on the Egyptian government spokesman's speech, stating that the six principles adopted by the Security Council are still valid because they do not violate Egypt's goals, interests, or sovereignty, nor do they violate the interests of world peace. However, Britain and France, after taking blatant acts of aggression, are no longer qualified to negotiate directly with Egypt.

The "News" editorial wrote that all future negotiations on the canal issue should be conducted through the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: Cairo dispatch: An Egyptian government spokesman announced on the 26th that the Egyptian government had reached an agreement with United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on several issues and the basis for clearing the canal.

The head of the Suez Canal Authority, Younis, announced in Port Said on the same day that clearing operations on the Suez Canal had begun on the 26th. Younis said: "We have started work in Ismailia (central canal) and Suez (southern canal), salvaging small sunken ships there."

Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: Washington dispatch: The press attaché of the Egyptian Embassy in the United States, Habib, refuted on the 26th the so-called Egyptian delay in clearing the Suez Canal.

He said: "Egypt has not created any difficulties for the United Nations representatives who are currently cooperating with Egypt to clear the Suez Canal."

He said: "Mutual understanding and cooperation between Egypt and the United Nations on this issue are increasing day by day. Egypt is very willing to clear the canal and restore the canal's normal navigation, and Egypt's desire in this regard is stronger than any other country."

    这个发言人指出，埃及将不会忘记过去发生的事情，将不会和侵略者直接进行讨论。他说，由于埃及已经和它们断绝了关系，所以更不会这样做。

    “人民报”今天就埃及政府发言人的这篇谈话发表社论说，安全理事会所通过的六项原则还是有效的，因为它们并不违反埃及的目标、利益或主权，也不违反世界和平的利益。但是，英国和法国在采取了明目张胆的侵略行动以后，已经没有资格同埃及直接进行谈判。
    “消息报”的社论写道，今后关于运河问题的一切谈判都应当通过联合国来进行。

    新华社27日讯　华盛顿消息：埃及驻美大使馆新闻参赞哈比布26日驳斥了所谓埃及拖延苏伊士运河清理工作。
    他说：“埃及没有为目前正同埃及合作清理苏伊士运河的联合国代表制造任何困难。”
