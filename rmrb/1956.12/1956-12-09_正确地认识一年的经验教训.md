　　Correctly Understanding the Lessons of a Year's Experience
    The season has reached "Heavy Snow," but winter production in rural Shandong Province has not yet become active. Winter plowing is being carried out sporadically and slowly, winter irrigation of wheat is also much worse than last year, and there is very little action in terms of farmland water conservancy construction.

    Why is it that after Shandong Province achieved an all-round bumper harvest of grain and cotton, winter production is proceeding so slowly and weakly?

    In recent days, Shandong's "Dazhong Daily" has published a series of editorials and articles on this issue. These articles unanimously pointed out that although there are various reasons for the lack of vigor in agricultural production this winter, the most important of these is that the broad masses of cadres have developed a passive mood of shrinking back after criticizing subjectivism in production leadership. Many people overemphasized some deviations in their work, mistakenly believing that everything in the past was wrong, and even the production momentum of last winter and spring should not be allowed. The articles believe that the reason why this phenomenon of negating everything and choking for fear of being choked has occurred is related to the fact that party and government leading organs at all levels have not been able to help the broad masses of cadres to correctly absorb the experience and lessons of leading production over the past year in a timely manner. Party committees at all levels must face up to this problem, earnestly lead everyone to sum up past work in a realistic manner, clarify confused thinking, and organize the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and the masses, and quickly throw themselves into winter production.

    The articles listed many facts to illustrate that the call of "completing the five-year agricultural production increase plan in four years" and many production increase measures put forward by party and government leading organs in the past year were correct. Although the province suffered from floods and other natural disasters this year, it still achieved an all-round bumper harvest, completing the huge production increase task of 30 billion jin of grain and 5 million dan of cotton. About 80% of agricultural cooperatives increased production, and about 80% of cooperative members increased their income. All of these are the most practical summary of the production leadership work in the past year. The editorial said that if we deny the positive role of the calls and various measures put forward by the leadership in the past year, it is not only inconsistent with objective facts, but also inevitably brings harmful negative emotions to cadres and the masses, and makes them produce a kind of illusion that production can do without leadership.

    The editorial also made a detailed analysis and criticism of the deviations and errors in leading production over the past year. However, all the editorials and articles emphasized that there are many lessons from the mistakes in production leadership over the past year, but there is even more rich good experience. The key issue is how to comprehensively and correctly understand and accept them. The correct attitude should be to carry forward past achievements and advantages, correct shortcomings and mistakes, so as to work better and more actively, and should not adopt a cautious and passive attitude. As long as the ideological understanding problem is solved, with the production momentum of last winter and spring, coupled with the work style of in-depth investigation and research and proceeding from reality, the winter production movement can be done even better.

### 正确地认识一年的经验教训

　　正确地认识一年的经验教训
    时节已到“大雪”，但是山东省农村的冬季生产还没有活跃起来。冬耕进行得零星而迟缓，小麦冬浇也比去年差得多，农田水利建设方面更是很少行动。
    为什么山东省在赢得粮棉全面丰收以后，冬季生产反而进行得这样迟滞无力呢？
    山东“大众日报”这几天就这一问题连续发表了社论和文章。这些论文一致指出，今冬农业生产的劲头不大虽然有种种原因，但是其中最主要的，是广大干部在批判了领导生产中的主观主义以后，产生了缩手缩脚的消极情绪。很多人过分强调了工作中的一些偏差，误认为过去的一切都错了，甚至连去冬今春的那种生产劲头也要不得了。论文认为，这种否定一切、因噎废食的现象之所以发生，是同各级党政领导机关没有能够及时帮助广大干部正确地吸取一年来领导生产的经验教训有关的。各级党委必须正视这个问题，切实领导大家实事求是地总结过去的工作，澄清混乱思想，把广大干部和群众的社会主义积极性组织起来，迅速投入冬季生产。
    论文列举了很多事实，说明过去一年来党政领导机关所提出的
  “四年完成五年农业增产计划”的号召和许多增产措施是正确的。今年全省虽然遭到水灾和其它自然灾害，但是仍然获得了全面丰收，完成了三百亿斤粮食、五百万担棉花的巨大增产任务，有80％左右的农业社增产，80％左右的社员增加了收入。所有这些，就是过去一年来生产领导工作的最实际的总结。社论说，如果否认一年来领导方面所提出的号召和各项措施的积极作用，不仅不合乎客观事实，而且不可免地会给干部和群众带来有害的消极情绪，使他们产生一种生产可以不要领导的错觉。
    对于一年来在领导生产中的偏差和错误，社论也作了详尽的分析和批判。但是，所有的社论和文章都强调指出，一年来生产领导上的错误的教训是很多的，可是好的经验更是丰富，关键问题在于如何全面地、正确地加以认识和接受。正确的态度应该是发扬过去的成绩和优点，改正缺点和错误，从而更好、更积极地工作，而不应该采取谨小慎微的消极态度。只要把这个思想认识问题解决了，以去冬今春那种生产劲头，再加上深入调查研究从实际出发的工作作风，那末今冬的生产运动就可以搞得更好。
