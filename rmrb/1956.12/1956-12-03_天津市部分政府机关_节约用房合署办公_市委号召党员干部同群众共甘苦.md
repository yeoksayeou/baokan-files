Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 1st: The Tianjin Municipal Planning Committee and the Tianjin Municipal Statistics Bureau, which have relatively spacious office space, began moving into the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee organs today to work in joint offices in order to save space. The eleven-story building originally occupied by these two organs, the Li Hua Building, has been completely vacated for units in urgent need of office space.

　　The Li Hua Building has 173 rooms, excluding toilets and kitchens, with an indoor area of approximately 4,000 square meters. When the Planning Committee moved into this building in 1954, the average office space per person reached 12 square meters, more than double the area stipulated by the Real Estate Management Bureau. Later, the Tianjin Municipal Statistics Bureau moved into this building. However, due to changes in personnel establishment, the average office space per person is still above 10 square meters. The functional departments of the Planning Committee have an average of more than ten staff members, and each department occupies three or four rooms. Most department heads have individual offices, with an indoor area of approximately 40 square meters.

　　The leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Planning Committee and the Statistics Bureau have recently attached great importance to changing this unreasonable use of office space. They have actively consulted with responsible comrades of relevant organs of the Municipal People's Committee and called on the staff of their respective units to promote the spirit of hard work and plain living. The office space into which these two units are currently moving totals 64 rooms, with an area of 1,600 square meters, which is less than half of what they occupied in the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 1st: The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China calls on all Party members and cadres in the city to share weal and woe with the people.

　　At a meeting attended by more than 3,000 Party members and cadres this morning, Li Gengtao, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, said: "At present, some commodities in the market are in short supply. It is hoped that all Party members and cadres will continue to promote the fine traditions of thrift and hard work and plain living. While the standard of living is gradually improving, we should pay more attention to thrift, save more, and buy less of the daily necessities and non-staple foods that are currently in relatively short supply, so as to save more commodities for the supply of the citizens."

　　Li Gengtao also said that since the beginning of this year, due to the rapid development of national construction, Tianjin's production potential has been brought into play, the number of employed people has increased by 45,000, and wage levels have also increased. After the organization of suburban peasants, handicraftsmen, and small vendors, their incomes have also increased to varying degrees, and the overall social purchasing power has increased to an unprecedented level. Therefore, a shortage of some materials has emerged. However, the commodities put into the market this year are not less, but more, than in the past.

### 天津市部分政府机关　节约用房合署办公  市委号召党员干部同群众共甘苦

    天津市部分政府机关
　　节约用房合署办公
　  市委号召党员干部同群众共甘苦
    新华社天津1日电　办公用房较宽绰的天津市计划委员会和天津市统计局，为了节约用房今天已开始迁入天津市人民委员会机关内合署办公。这两个机关原占用的一幢十一层大楼——利华大楼，全部腾出来让给急需用房的单位。
    利华大楼除厕所、厨房外，有用房一百七十三间，室内面积约四千平方公尺。1954年，计划委员会迁入这幢大楼的时候，平均每人办公用房面积曾达到十二平方公尺，超过房产管理局规定一倍以上。以后，天津市统计局迁入了这幢大楼。但是，由于人员编制的变动，现在每人办公用房面积仍在十平方公尺以上。计划委员会的各职能处平均有工作人员十多个人，用房都是三、四间。多数处长都有单独的办公室，室内面积约四十平方公尺。
    天津市计划委员会和统计局的领导方面最近已非常重视改变这种用房不合理的情况。他们曾积极和市人民委员会有关机关负责人研究，并号召本单位工作人员发扬艰苦朴素的作风。目前这两个单位正在迁入的办公用房共六十四间，面积有一千六百平方公尺，还不足过去的二分之一。
    新华社天津1日电　中共天津市委员会号召全市党员干部同人民群众共甘苦。
    在今天上午举行的三千多党员干部参加的大会上，市委书记李耕涛说：在目前市场上部分商品呈现了供不应求的情况，希望全体党员干部继续发扬节约和艰苦朴素的优良传统，在目前生活水平已经逐步提高的时候，应该多注意节约，多注意储蓄，少购买些目前比较缺乏的日用品和副食品，把更多的商品省下来供应给市民群众。
    李耕涛还说，今年以来，由于国家建设事业迅速发展，天津市生产潜力得到发挥，就业人数增加了四万五千人，工资水平也提高了。郊区农民、手工业者、小商贩等组织起来以后，收入也有了不同程度的增加，整个社会购买力提高到历史上未有的水平。因此，一部分物资出现了供不应求的现象。但今年以来投入市场的商品不是比过去少而是比过去多。
