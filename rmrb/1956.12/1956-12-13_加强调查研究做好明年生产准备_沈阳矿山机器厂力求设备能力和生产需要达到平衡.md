Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 12th (Reporter Shen Junhai) – The Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant is starting with investigation and research to prepare for next year's production.

    The factory's production tasks for next year mainly involve producing large-scale mineral processing, hoisting, and transportation equipment, as well as trial-manufacturing sixteen new products. Based on these characteristics, the factory first mobilized and organized all cadres and technical personnel to investigate and study the equipment status and technical strength for completing next year's production tasks together with the workers. During the investigation, they discovered an imbalance in important equipment capacity. The equipment capacity of five of the seven workshops' main workshops could not keep up with production needs. Next year's cast iron task will exceed equipment capacity by 70%. Vertical lathes and gantry planers for processing large parts are particularly lacking, while riveting, welding, and small parts processing tasks are not as full. Therefore, the factory held a meeting of key technical cadres, proposing a plan to improve sixteen pieces of special equipment and special tools. At the same time, a special team was established. Now, the technical personnel of this team have completed the improvement of five projects, including large headstocks and gear grinding machines. After all sixteen equipment improvement projects are completed by the first quarter of next year, and another large vertical lathe and a gantry planer are installed, the factory can fully achieve a balance between equipment capacity and production needs.

    In order to fundamentally save raw materials in next year's production, the factory also organized a technical improvement team of more than twenty key technical cadres. Under the leadership of the chief engineer, the technical personnel of this team are reviewing the designs of ten products that are produced in large quantities year-round next year, proposing forty-one technical improvement measures to save raw materials, reduce working hours, and ensure quality. According to the improved design, they changed the steel plate thickness of the flotation machine's side grooves from eight millimeters to six millimeters, thus saving four hundred kilograms of steel material per flotation machine. They have now implemented ten technical improvement measures.

    加强调查研究做好明年生产准备
    沈阳矿山机器厂力求设备能力和生产需要达到平衡
    新华社沈阳12日电　新华社记者沈俊海报道：沈阳矿山机器厂从调查研究入手作好明年生产准备工作。
    这个工厂明年的生产任务，主要是生产大型的选矿、起重和运输设备，还要试制十六种新产品。根据这个特点，工厂首先动员和组织全体干部、技术人员，同工人群众一起调查研究了完成明年生产任务的设备状况和技术力量。他们在调查中，发现重要的设备能力不平衡，七个车间有五个主要车间的设备能力赶不上生产需要，明年铸铁任务大于设备能力70％，加工大型部件的立式车床和龙门刨床特别缺乏；铆焊和小件加工的任务反而吃不饱。于是全厂召开主要技术干部会议，提出了改进十六项专用设备和专用工具的计划，同时成立了专门的小组。现在，这个小组的技术人员已经完成了大头车、研齿机等五个项目的改进工作。到明年第一季度把十六个项目的设备全部加以改进以后，再安装一台大立式车床和一台龙门刨床，厂里就可以完全做到设备能力和生产需要之间的平衡。
    这个工厂为了在明年生产中能够从根本上节约原材料，还组织了一个二十多名主要技术干部参加的技术改进小组。这个小组的技术人员在总工程师领导下，对明年常年大批生产的十种产品的设计，进行复查，提出了四十一项节约原材料、减少工时、保证质量等的技术改进措施。他们根据改进后的设计，把浮选机两侧槽子的钢板厚度由八公厘改为六公厘，这样，每台浮选机可以节省钢铁材料四百公斤。现在，他们已经实现了十项技术改进措施。
