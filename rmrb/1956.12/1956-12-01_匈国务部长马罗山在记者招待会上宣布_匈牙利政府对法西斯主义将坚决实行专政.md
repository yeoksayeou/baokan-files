Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 30th: According to a Czechoslovak News Agency correspondent in Budapest, Hungarian Minister of State Marosan held a press conference for foreign journalists in the Budapest Parliament Building on the 28th, where he explained the situation in Hungary and reported on the current situation.

Marosan cited facts to show that in the past few weeks there has been a growing danger of capitalist restoration. He said that one day a delegation came to Parliament and demanded the abolition of the 1945 order to nationalize all enterprises with more than one hundred workers. The next day, the former landlords appeared in various places and simply wanted to drive the peasants off their land. Most prominent was Cardinal Mindszenty's demand to punish those who formulated this "system." The reactionaries understood this very well and began to eliminate Party workers and cadres of state organs.

Speaking of the current situation, Marosan talked about the cunning methods of the counter-revolutionaries. He said that after the reactionaries were defeated militarily, they turned to political means and called for strikes and boycotts. This weapon, which was effective at the beginning, is now losing its effectiveness, because the workers are already distrustful of the strike instigators, and the petty bourgeoisie also hope to have peace and restore order. Helping to consolidate the domestic situation are not only the Hungarian government and the Soviet troops in Hungary, but also the explanatory activities of the Communists who are beginning to reorganize their ranks.

Marosan continued that the support of the socialist world is also of great importance.

Marosan then said that the Hungarian government will continue to implement democratic methods, but it will resolutely implement dictatorship against fascism.

Speaking of the progress of the negotiations between the government and the representatives of the Provisional Workers' Council, Marosan said that the establishment of a National Production Committee is being considered to supervise and guide the implementation of correct economic measures. However, some Provisional Workers' Councils have put forward political conditions that the government cannot agree to. For example, elements who advocate holding strikes again have recently demanded that Imre Nagy participate in the government. It is interesting to note that, for example, half an hour before the announcement of a forty-eight-hour strike on November 21, British radio and Radio Free Europe had already broadcast the news about it in advance. This shows that there is a radio connection between the Budapest Committee and the West. Some workers' committees received instructions from the West on how to conduct their activities and make demands. Regarding this, Marosan mentioned two unregistered radio transceivers in the US Embassy in Budapest. It is also worth noting that Cardinal Mindszenty expressed the view in the American Embassy that the Nagy government would be better than the Kádár government.

Marosan said that the Workers' Councils will continue to undergo a process of internal purification, in which all kinds of fascists and criminals who have sneaked in will be exposed. These elements will be eliminated when the Workers' Councils are properly elected.

Marosan continued that currently, Party organizations are being established in enterprises and rural areas. The newly formed Party does not strive to absorb all the former members of the Hungarian Working People's Party, but rather emphasizes the issue of quality. Despite the fact that the reactionaries are trying to slander the glorious Communists, the organizational work of the Party continues. Many Communists were persecuted during this incident, and they lost their dearest relatives, but their first thought was to work for the Party again. Such comrades will be promoted to important positions.

### 匈国务部长马罗山在记者招待会上宣布　匈牙利政府对法西斯主义将坚决实行专政

　　匈国务部长马罗山在记者招待会上宣布
　　匈牙利政府对法西斯主义将坚决实行专政
    新华社布拉格30日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社驻布达佩斯记者报道，匈牙利国务部长马罗山28日在布达佩斯议会大厦举行了外国记者招待会，他在会上解释了匈牙利事件的情况并且报告了目前的局势。
    马罗山举出一些事实，说明过去几个星期存在着资本主义复辟的越来越大的危险。他说，一个代表团有一天来到议会，要求废除1945年关于凡是有一百名以上的工人的企业收归国有的命令。第二天，以前的地主在各个地方出现了，他们干脆就想把农民从他们的土地上赶走。最突出的是明曾蒂红衣主教要求惩处拟订这种“制度”的人。对这一点，反动分子了解得非常清楚，他们开始消灭党的工作人员和国家机关的干部。
    在谈到目前的局势时，马罗山谈到反革命的狡猾手段。他说当反动分子在军事上被击败以后，他们就转而采取政治手段和要求罢工和进行抵制。这个在开始时有效的武器现在已经不灵了，因为工人们已经对罢工的煽动者抱着不信任的态度，而且，小资产阶级人士也希望得到安静和恢复秩序。帮助巩固国内局势的不但是匈牙利政府和在匈牙利的苏联军队，而且还有正在开始整顿他们的队伍的共产党人的解释活动。
    马罗山继续说，社会主义世界的支持也有着极大的重要性。
    马罗山接着说，匈牙利政府将继续施行民主的方法，但是，它将对法西斯主义坚决实行专政。
    马罗山在谈到政府和临时工人委员会代表之间所进行的谈判的进程时说，正在考虑建立国民生产委员会来监督指导经济的正确措施的执行。但是，某些临时工人委员会提出了政府所不能同意的政治条件。例如，主张再举行罢工的分子最近以来再度要求伊姆雷·纳吉参加政府。耐人寻味的是：例如在11月21日宣布举行四十八小时罢工的半小时以前，英国电台和“自由欧洲”广播电台就预先广播了关于这件事的消息。这就表明，在布达佩斯委员会和西方之间，有着无线电的联系。某些工人委员会从西方接到了关于它们如何进行活动和提出要求的指示。关于这一点，马罗山谈到了美国驻布达佩斯大使馆中的两部没有登记过的无线电收发报机。还值得注意的是，红衣主教明曾蒂在美国大使馆中表示这种看法：纳吉政府将比卡达尔政府好。
    马罗山说，工人委员会仍将经过纯洁内部的过程，在这个过程中间，那些偷偷地混进来的形形色色的法西斯分子和罪犯将被揭穿真面目。在适当地进行选举工人委员会的时候，这些分子将要被清除掉。
    马罗山接着说，目前，党的组织正在企业和农村中建立起来。新生的党并不争取吸收所有以前匈牙利劳动人民党的党员参加，而是要特别强调质量的问题。尽管存在着反动派正在设法诬蔑光荣的共产党人的事实，党的组织工作继续在进行。很多共产党人在这次事件期间受到了迫害，他们失去了他们最亲爱的眷属，但是，他们的第一个想法就是再为党工作。这样的同志将要被提升担任重要的工作。
