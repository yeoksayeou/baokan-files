　　Castrated Rams and Others
　　Wei Jinzhi
    Aizi kept two rams at home. The rams liked to butt heads and would tilt their heads and use their horns to attack strangers they met. The students who came and went to Aizi's house were also often injured.

    The students suggested to Aizi: "Rams are naturally fierce, so they attack people. If they were castrated, their personalities would become more docile, and they would definitely not attack people again!"

    Aizi smiled and said, "That's not right. Aren't the castrated ones even more fierce now?" [Note]

      [Note] Refers to the eunuchs who were running rampant and acting lawlessly at the time.

    Guqin (Ancient Zither)

    A guqin master, thinking his skills were extraordinary, went to the market to show off his talents. The people in the market, thinking he was playing the pipa or yueqin, rushed over to surround him. But the sound of the guqin was very soft, and the people were very noisy, so the sound of the guqin could not be heard at all. People gradually dispersed; only one person stood still. The guqin master thought he was his soulmate, so he respectfully asked, "How did I play? Please criticize and advise!"

    That person said, "The table you put the qin on is mine. I'm going to take it back!"

    Dreaming

    A scholar violated school rules and was caught by the school director. The school director sat angrily in the hall waiting, preparing to punish the scholar severely.

    The scholar knew that the school director was usually very strict, and begging for mercy would be in vain, so he came up with a plan to trick the school director. He knelt respectfully in front of the school director, saying nothing else, only saying, "Student originally wanted to come to surrender earlier, but it was because I happened to get a thousand taels of silver and had to find a way to arrange it, so I was late."

    When the school director heard that the scholar had a large income, his heart stirred, and his anger had already dissipated by half. He asked, "Where did this money come from?"

    The scholar replied, "It was dug out from the ground!"

    "Then, how do you plan to arrange it?"

    The scholar said, "Student's family was originally very poor. After discussing it with my wife, we want to use half of the money to buy farmland, two hundred taels to buy land and build a house, one hundred taels to buy tools, and one hundred taels to buy maids and servants..."

    The school director quickly interjected and asked, "What about the other hundred taels?"

    "Half to buy books, preparing to be determined to study hard."

    "What about the remaining fifty taels?" the school director anxiously asked.

    "These fifty taels will be given to you, teacher, to repay your great kindness in educating me on weekdays."

    "Is that so? I really dare not accept it," the school director said contentedly.

    The school director ordered his family to prepare wine and dishes and kept the scholar at home for a drink. In the middle of the drinking, the teacher and student talked and laughed, and were very happy. Later, the school director still couldn't forget the fifty taels of silver, and asked the scholar, "You came here in such a hurry, has the money been packed properly?"

    The scholar stood up and said, "Student had just finished allocating the silver, but was awakened by my wife. When I looked, the silver was no longer in front of me, so there was no use in packing it."

    "So, what you said was just a dream?" the school director asked anxiously.

    The scholar said slowly, "I was originally talking about a dream."

    The school director was very disappointed and very angry, but he didn't want to change his face immediately, so he could only say sourly, "I appreciate it! I appreciate it! It's rare that you still remember me in your dream!"

　　阉羊及其他
　　魏金枝
    艾子家里养了两只公羊。公羊喜欢斗角，遇见陌生人，侧着头用角来触人。在艾子家来往的学生，也常常被触伤。
    学生们向艾子提议：“公羊生性凶猛，所以要触人，假使把他们阉了，性格就会变得驯良一些，决不会再触人了！”
    艾子笑了笑，说：“不对，如今阉了的，不是更凶猛么？”〔注〕
      〔注〕意即指当时横行不法的宦官。

    古琴
    一个古琴名手，以为自己的技艺了不得，到市场上去献技。市场上的人，以为是弹琵琶，操月琴的，便争先恐后地赶了来，把他团团围住。可是古琴的声音很轻，而人声又非常嘈杂，所以琴声一点也听不见。人们陆续地散去了；只有一个人还是呆呆地站着。古琴名手以为他是自己的知音，便恭恭敬敬地问道：“我弹的怎样？请你批评指教！”
    那人便说：“你搁琴的这张桌子是我的，我预备搬回去！”
                ——出自“雅谑”
    做梦
    秀才犯了学规，被学博捉了去。学博怒气冲冲地坐在堂上等着，预备狠狠地惩治秀才。
    秀才知道这学博平常很严厉，求饶也是枉然，便心生一计，预备捉弄学博一番。他恭恭敬敬地跪在学博面前，不说别的，只说：“学生本想早来投案的，只因正好得了一千两银子，要设法安排，所以来迟了。”
    学博一听秀才有一笔大收入，心一动，怒气早已消了一半，问道：“这笔钱是从哪里来的？”
    秀才回道：“是从地下掘出来的！”
    “那么，你预备怎么安排呢？”
    秀才说道：“学生本来家里很穷，和妻子商量的结果，想用一半的钱买田地，二百两买地造屋，一百两买器具，一百两买丫头、童仆。……”
    学博赶紧插上去问：“还有一百两呢？”
    “一半买书籍，预备立志用功读书了。”
    “余下的五十两呢？”学博耽心地问。
    “这五十两就送给你先生，报答先生平日教育的大恩。”
    “这样么，我实在不敢当。”学博满意地说。
    学博吩咐家人预备酒菜，留秀才在家里吃酒。吃酒中间，师生两人，有说有笑，都非常高兴。后来学博还是念念不忘那五十两银子，问秀才道：“你急匆匆地到这里来，那笔银子已经收拾妥当了么？”
    秀才立起身，说：“学生正好把银子分配定当，却被内人弄醒了，一看银子，早已不在眼前，所以也无用收拾了。”
    “那么，你说的，原来是做梦？”学博着急地问。
    秀才慢条斯理地说：“我本来说的是做梦。”
    学博心里非常失望，也非常愤怒，却又不便立刻变脸，只好酸溜溜地说：“承情！承情！难得你在梦中还记得我！”
              ——出自“雪涛小说”
