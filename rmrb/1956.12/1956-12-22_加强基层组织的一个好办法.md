    A Good Way to Strengthen Grassroots Organizations
    Yi Huai
  The need to strengthen the power of rural grassroots organizations is an urgent problem that many leading bodies are beginning to address. Judging from the current situation in various localities, there are roughly two approaches being taken.
    Many leading bodies have already extracted a large number of staff members to form inspection teams, work teams, and inspection groups, led by leading cadres, to go deep into grassroots organizations to promote work. This is, of course, a good phenomenon. After going to the countryside, some inspection teams and work groups have indeed solved many important problems on the spot. At the same time, they have enabled leading bodies to grasp the situation more specifically and in a timely manner, which is beneficial to strengthening grassroots work and overcoming the bureaucracy and subjectivism of leading bodies. Some leading bodies have adopted another approach: transferring a large number of experienced cadres to enrich grassroots organizations, such as the Nanchang Prefectural Committee and Fuzhou Prefectural Committee in Jiangxi, and the Dongxiang County Committee (see page 4 of the People's Daily on the 16th).
    After the cadre strength of each township in Dongxiang County was strengthened, a new atmosphere immediately appeared in the work, the work proceeded smoothly, and the deviations and errors in the implementation of policies were obviously reduced. It should be said that this method of transferring capable cadres to enrich the grassroots is a more effective and fundamental way to strengthen grassroots work. The reason is obvious. The same person, if he is transferred to the lower level to hold a position, will naturally have a stronger sense of responsibility than being a member of a temporary work group, and it is also easier to understand the situation and connect with the masses. What's more, work groups cannot be present in every township, nor can they stay in one place for a long time. Therefore, this phenomenon has occurred in many places: when the work group is there, the work is done better; when the work group leaves, many problems arise. Sending cadres to grassroots organizations to work makes it easier to avoid these shortcomings. Especially at a time when leading bodies at all levels are generally overstaffed and inefficient, instead of forming work groups with a large number of cadres who can be extracted and sending them to help with work, why not place them in grassroots organizations? This is, of course, not to deny the significance of work groups. Sending work groups is a regular way for leading bodies to understand the situation and inspect and guide work. They should be sent now, and they should continue to be sent and regularly sent in the future. However, if we want to effectively strengthen grassroots work, it is not enough to rely solely on sending work groups. The best way is to take a two-pronged approach, both extracting people to enrich the lower levels and sending people down to inspect and promote work. This should be possible. We believe that the Nanchang Prefectural Committee, the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee and other leading bodies will certainly not stop sending people down to inspect work after extracting people to enrich the lower levels.
    Unfortunately, up to now, we have seen more of sending work groups to help with work, and less of transferring cadres to enrich the grassroots. It seems that some leading bodies are not very determined to extract and send people down. This inevitably makes people worry, first, that the method of sending work groups will replace streamlining the organization; second, that even work groups will not be sent down regularly after this gust of wind passes.

    加强基层组织的一个好办法
    易槐
  农村基层组织的力量亟待加强，这是许多领导机关正在着手解决的一个问题。就目前各地的情况看，大致有两种作法。
    有不少领导机关已经抽出大批工作人员，组成视察团、工作队、检查组，由领导干部率领，深入到基层组织去推动工作。这当然是一种好现象。有些视察团、工作组下乡后，的确已经就地解决了许多重要问题。同时，也使领导机关更具体更及时地掌握了情况，这对加强基层工作、克服领导机关的官僚主义和主观主义都是有好处的。有一些领导机关采取了另一种办法：抽调大批有经验的干部去充实基层组织。像江西南昌地委、抚州地委和东乡县委（见16日人民日报四版）那样。
    东乡县各乡在干部力量加强以后，工作中立刻出现了新气象，工作进行得顺利了，执行政策中的偏差错误也显然减少了。应该说，这种抽调得力干部充实基层的作法，是加强基层工作的一个更有效更根本的办法。道理是很明显的。同是一个人，把他抽调到下边去担任职务，比起作为临时派下去的工作组人员，他的责任心自然就会更强些，也更便于了解情况和联系群众。更何况，工作组毕竟不能乡乡都有，也不可能长期住在一个地方。因此，很多地方都发生过这种现象：工作组在时，工作就作得好些；工作组一走，毛病就出了很多。把干部派到基层组织担任工作，就容易避免这些缺点。特别是在目前各级领导机关普遍机构臃肿人浮于事的情况下，与其把可以抽出的大批干部组成工作组，派去帮助工作，何不把他们就放在基层组织中呢？这当然不是否定工作组的意义。派遣工作组是领导机关了解情况、检查和指导工作的经常办法，现在要派，以后还要继续派、经常派。但是，如果要切实加强基层工作，单靠派工作组，就是不够的了。最好的办法是双管齐下，既抽人充实下层，又派人下去检查和推动工作。这应当是能够做到的。我们相信，南昌地委，抚州地委等领导机关，决不会在抽人充实下层后，就不再派人下去检查工作了。
    可惜到目前为止，看到得最多的还是派工作组下去帮助工作，而很少看到抽调干部充实基层的。看来，有些领导机关的抽人下放决心还不是很大。这就不免使人担心，一则害怕用派工作组的办法代替了精简机构；二则害怕这一阵风过去以后连工作组也不经常下去了。
