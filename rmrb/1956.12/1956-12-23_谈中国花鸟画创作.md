    On the Creation of Chinese Flower-and-Bird Painting
    Yu Feian
    As the saying goes, "Before loving flowers, one must rise early," which means that "flower mornings" are the best time to view flowers. Just as the overnight rain has cleared, and the tender sun is beginning to shine, or when the clear dew hasn't yet dried, and the blue sky is freshly washed, the flowers appear even more truly red and genuinely green, and the birds appear even more emerald and azure, even more lively and lovable. In Bai Juyi's "Memories of Jiangnan," he wrote, "When the sun rises, the river flowers are redder than fire," and in Du Yan's lotus poem, "A bloom opens on the misty waves at dawn, like a true imperial concubine emerging from her bath." Our ancient flower-and-bird painters knew that flowers and birds in gentle scenery are the most pleasing and enjoyable to admire. They deeply, repeatedly observed, analyzed, compared, and processed (including techniques such as rendering light and shade), making the flowers and birds in gentle scenery even more figurative and artistic. The fresh flower-and-bird paintings they created are even more vivid, fragrant, and adorable than real flowers and birds.
    So-called meticulous flower-and-bird painting is not merely a realistic depiction. Although it is said to "capture the likeness of flowers and convey the spirit of birds," the flowers and birds depicted are required to achieve "both form and spirit," neither can be lacking. In the ninth century (Tang Dynasty), when Xiao Yue painted bamboo, Bai Juyi inscribed his bamboo painting with the poem: "Raising my head, I suddenly see it's not like a painting; lowering my ear, I quietly listen and suspect there's sound." These two lines not only illustrate the relationship between form and spirit but also allow one to appreciate that Chinese flower-and-bird painting depicts movement. For flowers, one must reflect the wind, sunshine, rain, and dew; for birds, one must depict their eating, sleeping, flying, and chirping. This is fundamentally different from so-called "still life" in terms of creative methods.
    In the creation of Chinese flower-and-bird painting, in terms of collecting materials, while carefully observing with the eyes, one must also use the brain to select, analyze, and compare. For living things, one must look from this side and also from that side, and one must observe from all directions and different angles to find the images that one considers good and suitable for painting. In the past, people used charcoal sticks, and now people use pencils, to draw them at any time (it's better to use sketches). The more materials are accumulated in this way, and the more the vitality of the image is recognized, the more that removing some things that are considered less important or trivial details will make the things to be expressed appear cleaner, more focused, and more prominent, and better display its vitality. This gradually achieves the combination of appearance and spirit, making the material better used for my purposes. But for birds, this is not enough; one must also practice making the eyes' observation and the brain's memory more acute, finding various different actions of various birds from fleeting moments, and carrying out silent memorization and silent writing. The most important thing is to find the source of their dynamics. After such in-depth experience, the spiritual appearance of various birds will naturally be as clear as if they are before one's eyes when one closes them, and the brush will immediately reach the tip of the wrist when one starts to paint. The rapid movements of birds are sometimes impossible to describe on the spot, and must be pondered after "mental painting" back in the room.
    Flower-and-bird painting heritage, since the late Tang Dynasty, has been quite rich in what has been passed down (including both domestic and foreign). In studying the heritage, one should study how ancient painters viewed, processed, and expressed flowers and birds, whether they used the double-outline method, the boneless method, the outline-flower-dot-leaf method, or the "dot-heap-feather" method. Regarding the brush and ink techniques of flower-and-bird painting, they were relatively simple before the Northern Song Dynasty, and became more diverse after the Northern Song Dynasty. Studying the heritage should be to make it serve our purposes, which is similar to studying classical literature; studying is for application, and the most taboo is swallowing it whole without digesting it. That is my opinion. (Attached image)

    谈中国花鸟画创作
    于非闇
    俗语说：“未从爱花先早起”，这是说“花晨”是看花最好的时光。正当宿雨初晴、娇阳乍吐，或是清露未晞、碧空如洗的时候，花卉越显得红的真红、绿的正绿，禽鸟也越显得更翠更碧，更加活泼可爱。唐白居易忆江南词“日出江花红胜火”，宋杜衍荷花诗“晓开一朵烟波上，似画真妃出浴时”。我们古代的花鸟画家们就知道，在柔和景色里的花和鸟是最惹人喜欢、最为人乐意欣赏的，他们深刻地往复地观察、分析、比较和加工（包括晕染浓淡等手法），使得花和鸟在柔和的景色里更形象化、艺术化了。他们所创造出来的新鲜的花鸟画，就比真的花鸟更加活色生香、生动可爱。
    所谓工笔花鸟画，不单纯是如实的描写，尽管说是“为花写照，为鸟传神”，但所画的花和鸟，都要求达到“形神兼到”，缺一不可。九世纪（唐）萧悦画竹，白居易题他的画竹诗说：“举头忽见不似画，低耳静听疑有声”，这两句诗，不单是说明形和神的关系，而且更可以体会到中国花鸟画是描写动态的。对于花卉要反映出风晴雨露，对于禽鸟要描绘出食宿飞鸣，这和所谓“静物画”，从创作的方法上就有着根本的不同。
    中国花鸟画创作，在搜集素材方面，通过眼睛仔细观察的同时，还必须通过脑子加以选择、分析和比较。对活生生的东西，从这面看看，还须从那面看看，还必须从四面八方、各个不同的角度上看出自己所认为好、认为可以入画的形象。古人是用炭松，今人是用铅笔，随时把它描画下来（用素描更好）。这样积累素材越多，认识到了形象的活力所在，去掉一些自认为关系不大或是枝枝节节的东西，反而显得所要表现的东西更干净、更集中、更突出，更可以显示出它的活力，这就逐步作到面貌与精神的结合，使得素材更好地为我所用。但对于禽鸟，这样作还不够，还要练习到使眼睛的观察和脑子的记忆更敏锐，从瞬息万变中找出各种鸟的各个不同的动作，进行默记默写，最主要是要找出它们动力的根源。必须经过这样深入的体验，自然就使各式各样的鸟的精神面貌，闭目如在目前，下笔就到了腕底了。禽鸟快速的动作，有时根本不可能在现场描写，而必须是经过“心画”之后，回到屋里去琢磨。
    花鸟画遗产，自晚唐以来，传世的相当丰富（包括域内外）。学习遗产，应该研究古代画家对花鸟怎样看待、处理和表达，无论他们使用双勾法、没骨法、勾花点叶法，或是“点垛翎毛”法。关于花鸟的笔墨技法，北宋以前比较单纯，北宋以后就更加多种多样。学习遗产要使它为我所用，这和学习古典文学差不多，学习为的是致用，最忌囫囵吞枣，我以为。（附图片）
