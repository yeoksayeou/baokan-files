    Bottomless Formwork
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Wuhan Metal Structure Factory construction site is using "bottomless formwork" to pour reinforced concrete pillars and beams, which can reduce project costs and save timber. Usually, when pouring concrete, the bottom formwork and side formwork are erected first, and then the concrete is poured. This construction site, when pouring pillars and beams, does not use bottom formwork, but instead lays a layer of oiled paper on the compacted and smoothed pouring area, and then erects bamboo formwork on the sides for pouring.
    This pouring method is simple and easy to implement. More than 200 pillars already poured on the construction site cost only more than seven yuan each; if bottom formwork were used for pouring, each would cost more than twenty-eight yuan. This method saves more than one-third of the formwork materials and also saves the workers the arduous task of removing the bottom formwork. After strength tests, the poured pillars and beams are of very good quality.

    无底模板
    据新华社讯　武汉金属结构厂工地运用“无底模板”来浇灌钢筋混凝土柱子和梁，可以降低工程造价和节约木材。通常浇灌混凝土，都是先立起底面模板和两侧模板，然后浇灌。这个工地在浇灌柱子和梁的时候，不用底模板，而是在夯实和铲光了的浇灌场地，铺上一层油纸，然后立起两侧的竹模板进行浇灌。
    这种浇灌方法简单易行。工地上已经浇灌出来的二百多根柱子，每根造价只有七元多；假若采用有底模板浇灌，每根造价要二十八元多。这种方法既节约了三分之一以上的模板材料，还省去了工人们拆底面模板的艰苦的劳动。经过强度试验，浇灌出来的柱、梁，质量很好。
