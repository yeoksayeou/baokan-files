　　Peng Zhen's Speech
    Our experience is like branches, leaves and flowers, while the entirety of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of the global proletarian struggle are the roots and trunk. The flowers and leaves grow precisely from the roots and trunk of the flower as a unified whole. Comrades, friends!
    I thank Comrade Khrushchev for giving such high praise to the work of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. This is a great encouragement to us.
    Yes, we always say that the Chinese revolution followed the path of the October Socialist Revolution. This is not because we are being modest, but because it is the truth. We believe that the path opened up by the October Revolution is not only the path of liberation for the Russian people, but also the path of liberation for the Chinese people and the path of liberation for the working people of the world. We Chinese people did not blindly follow this path, nor did we easily stumble upon it. Rather, after nearly a hundred years of painstaking efforts and struggles by our predecessors, we finally found this path after the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China. It was along this path that we achieved the victory of the Chinese revolution and today's achievements. At the same time, because the Soviet Union was ahead of us, setting an example and providing us with a great deal of advanced experience and valuable lessons, this has made it much easier for us in revolution and construction. To use an analogy, it is not as difficult for us to go to the Americas now as it was for Columbus and others at the time. We took a plane from Beijing to Moscow this time, arriving in the evening after departing in the morning, which is much easier than for our predecessors. Can we forget those pioneers who devoted a lot of effort and made many sacrifices to open up the road for us? In any case, we should not and cannot forget them.
    Comrade Khrushchev just mentioned that the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party do not simply copy foreign experiences, but creatively adopt Chinese methods to carry out their work. Yes, we strive to do this. In our work, we strive to solve China's problems realistically, based on our actual conditions, using the experiences of the Soviet revolution and construction and the experiences of other countries. But this is nothing more than what the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism teaches us, and it is still the method taught to us by the experience of the Soviet Union and the proletarian struggles of other countries, as well as our own historical experience and lessons.
    Comrade Khrushchev said that China has a lot of new experience. Yes, we do have some new experience. However, we deeply know that we cannot exaggerate it in the slightest. We deeply know that our creative experience is only a small part of the entirety of Marxism-Leninism, of the experience of Soviet revolution and construction, and of the experience of the proletarian struggle around the world. To use an analogy: our experience is like some of the branches, leaves, and flowers on this vase of flowers in front of us, while the entirety of Marxism-Leninism, the entirety of the world's proletarian struggle, is like the roots and trunk of the flower. The flowers and leaves are a unified whole that grows precisely from the roots and trunk of the flower.
    Comrade Khrushchev said that the Chinese are very modest. Yes, our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong often teach our Party members to guard against pride and exaggeration, and to always be modest and prudent. Because modesty makes people progress, and pride makes people fall behind. However, so-called modesty and prudence is nothing else but being honest and realistic. We strive to do this. The reason why we always emphasize the decisive significance of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, the October Revolution, and the Soviet experience is precisely because it was indeed the October Revolution that opened up the path for us, and it was indeed the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism that pointed out the direction for us, armed us, and guided us to achieve the victory of the revolution and today's achievements. I propose a toast to the victory of the path of the October Revolution, to the pioneers of socialism!

　　彭真的讲话
    我们的经验，好比枝叶和花朵，而马克思列宁主义的整体和世界无产阶级斗争的经验的整体是根干。花朵和枝叶正是从花的根干上长出来的一个统一体。同志们，朋友们！
    我感谢赫鲁晓夫同志对中国人民和中国共产党的工作给予了这样高的评价。这对我们是一种很大的鼓舞。
    是的，我们总是说，我们中国革命是走的十月社会主义革命的道路。这并不是因为我们谦虚，而是因为这是事实。我们认为十月革命所开辟的道路不仅是俄国人民解放的道路，而且是中国人民解放的道路，也是全世界劳动人民解放的道路。我们中国人并不是盲目地走这条道路的，也不是轻易地拣到了这样一条道路，而是经过近百年来我们先辈的千辛万苦，努力奋斗，最后由十月革命的炮声把马克思列宁主义介绍到中国以后才找到了这条道路。我们就是沿着这条道路才取得了中国革命的胜利和今天的成就。同时因为有苏联走在我们的前面，做出了榜样，给我们提供了大量的、先进的经验和宝贵的教训，这就使我们在革命和建设中获得了许多的便利。打个譬喻说，我们现在要到美洲去就不像当时哥伦布等人那样困难了。我们这次从北京乘飞机到莫斯科，朝发夕至，比前人容易得多了，难道我们能够忘记那些费了很多心血，作了很多牺牲给我们开辟道路的先驱吗？无论如何是不应该也不能够的。
    方才赫鲁晓夫同志谈到，中国人民和中国共产党不是照抄外国的经验，而是创造性地采用中国的方式进行工作的。是的，我们是力求这样的。我们在工作中是力求根据我们的实际情况，运用苏联革命和建设的经验和其他各国的经验，实事求是地解决中国的问题的。但这也并不是什么别的，也仍然不过是马克思列宁主义普遍真理所教导我们的，也仍然是苏联和各国无产阶级斗争经验以及我们自己的历史经验教训所教导我们的办法吧了。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，中国有很多新的经验。是的，我们是有一些新的经验。但是，我们深深地知道，我们丝毫都不能把它夸大，我们深深地知道我们的一些创造性的经验，对于马克思列宁主义的整体来说，对于苏联的革命和建设经验来说，对于全世界无产阶级斗争的经验来说，只不过是一个小的部分。打个譬喻：我们的经验好比是我们面前这瓶花上的一些枝叶和一些花朵，而马克思列宁主义的整体，世界无产阶级斗争的经验的整体，则好比是花的根和干。花朵和枝叶正是从花的根干上长出来的一个统一体。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说中国人很谦虚。是的，我们的党中央和毛泽东同志经常教导我们的党员，要力戒骄傲虚夸，要永远谦虚谨慎。因为虚心会使人进步，骄傲会使人落后。但是，所谓谦虚谨慎，并不是别的，实际上就是老老实实，实事求是，我们是力求这样做的，我们所以总是强调马克思列宁主义的普遍真理、十月革命、苏联经验的决定意义，正是因为事实上确实是十月革命给我们开辟了道路，确实是马克思列宁主义普遍真理给我们指出了方向，把我们武装了起来，才引导我们取得革命的胜利和今天的成就。我提议为十月革命道路的胜利干杯，为社会主义的开路先锋干杯！
