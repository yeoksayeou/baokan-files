Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 30th - The people of East Pakistan held the largest rally since their independence in Dhaka on the afternoon of December 29th to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and listen to his speech. 200,000 people gathered at the large sports ground, which is equivalent to one-third of the city's population. Many of the audience came from other towns in East Pakistan.

After Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Suhrawardy walked onto the stage together, Maulana Bhashani, Chairman of the East Pakistan People's League, immediately presented him with a garland.

At the meeting, Bhashani delivered a speech first. He extended greetings to the Chinese people and expressed his belief that the friendship between Pakistan and China would guarantee peace and help maintain world peace. When the Chinese Premier began to speak, the crowd in the stadium cheered for a long time. The stadium was decorated with the flags of both countries and huge portraits of Mao Zedong and Jinnah.

Zhou Enlai's speech was translated into Bengali by Ataur Rahman, the Chief Minister of East Pakistan. In his speech, Premier Zhou emphasized that Asian-African solidarity is of extreme importance for safeguarding world peace. Every part of the Premier's speech of more than 3,000 words aroused enthusiastic applause.

When he finally said "Pak-Chini bhai bhai" (Pakistan-China are brothers) in Bengali, the people present responded with enthusiastic cheers and applause.

Afterwards, Suhrawardy delivered an impromptu speech, expressing his gratitude for Zhou Enlai's speech and expressing his hope to further strengthen the friendship between Pakistan and China and world peace.

Chief Minister Ataur Rahman, who spoke next, paid tribute to Zhou Enlai. He pointed out that the welcome meeting held for the Chinese Premier was the grandest that his compatriots had held for any foreign guest since independence.

Before Premier Zhou Enlai left the stage, he shouted "Pakistan-China bhai bhai" (Pakistan-China are brothers) three times in Bengali. Thereupon, the 200,000 people sitting on the ground stood up, cheered, applauded, and waved handkerchiefs, newspapers, and anything they were holding in their hands.

When the Premier left the stadium to go to the Governor's residence, the crowds gathered on the streets outside the stadium also cheered him warmly.

    巴基斯坦—中国是兄弟
    达卡二十万人集会欢迎周总理
    据新华社达卡30日电　东巴基斯坦人民12月29日下午在达卡举行了他们获得独立以来的最大一次集会，欢迎周恩来总理并且听取他的讲话。聚集在大运动场上的有二十万人，相当于全城人口的三分之一。听众中有很多人是来自东巴基斯坦的其他各个城镇的。
    在周恩来总理同苏拉瓦底总理一起走上讲台以后，东巴基斯坦人民联盟主席大毛拉·巴沙尼马上给他带上花环。
    在会上，巴沙尼首先致词。他对中国人民表示问候，并且表示相信巴基斯坦和中国的友谊将能保证和平和帮助维护世界和平。当中国总理开始讲话的时候，运动场内的群众发出了长时间的欢呼。运动场上挂着两国国旗和毛泽东和真纳的巨幅画像。
    周恩来的讲话由东巴基斯坦首席部长阿陶尔·拉赫曼译成孟加拉语。周总理在讲话中强调指出亚非团结对于保障世界和平具有极端重要的意义。总理发表的三千多字的讲话，每一部分都引起了热烈的掌声。
    当他在最后用孟加拉语说“巴克—秦尼巴依巴依”（巴中人民是兄弟）的时候，到会的人报以热烈的欢呼声和掌声。
    接着，苏拉瓦底发表即席讲话，对周恩来的讲话表示感谢，并且表示希望进一步加强巴中两国的友谊和世界和平。
    接着讲话的首席部长阿陶尔·拉赫曼向周恩来致意。他指出，为中国总理举行的这次欢迎会是他的同胞自从独立以来为任何外国客人所举行过的最盛大的一次。
    在周恩来总理离开讲台之前，他用孟加拉语高呼了三次“巴基斯坦—秦巴依巴依”（巴基斯坦—中国是兄弟）。于是坐在地上的二十万人站起来欢呼、鼓掌，并且挥动手帕、报纸和手中拿着的任何东西。
    在总理离开运动场前往省长官邸的时候，聚集在运动场外面街道上的人群也向他热烈欢呼。
