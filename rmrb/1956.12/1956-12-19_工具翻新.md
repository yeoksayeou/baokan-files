    Tool Refurbishment
    In the scrap warehouse of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant, workers are installing milling machines. Two installed lathes are also running non-stop.

    Installing machines in a scrap warehouse? I couldn't help but feel strange. The staff of the Tool Section saw my doubts and explained that this was to refurbish the tools that were worn out in the various workshops.

    It turned out that the staff of the Tool Section had spent a lot of effort to save on tools. The technical supervision team they formed went to the workshops every day to urge workers to reduce tool consumption. In fact, the workers were already very economical in using tools. However, due to the increased workload in the workshops, the number of tools consumed in each workshop not only did not decrease, but increased instead.

    At the end of August, based on the suggestions of workers and the experience of fraternal factories, the technical supervision team of the Tool Section organized several skilled workers to form a tool refurbishment team, installed machines in the scrap warehouse, and specialized in refurbishing the waste tools from the various workshops.

    The refurbishment team can make short tools longer, thin tools thicker, thin tools thicker, fine tools coarser, small tools larger, and dull tools sharper. More than 3,000 dull files from various workshops, after being soaked by fitters in a liquid mixed with hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid, had teeth that were as sharp as new. In this way, the various workshops will have all the files they need for the next year. Since the end of August, the refurbishment team has refurbished tens of thousands of cutting tools, measuring tools, tools, and auxiliary tools, which not only met the needs of production, but also saved the factory more than 34,000 yuan in tool costs.

    工具翻新
    新华社记者　沈俊海
    在沈阳第二机床厂的废品库里，工人们正在安装铣床。两台安装好了的车床也在不停地转动着。
    在废品库里安装机器？我不禁感到奇怪。工具科的工作人员看出我有疑问，就解释说，这是为了翻修各个车间用坏了的工具。
    原来，工具科的工作人员曾经为节约工具花费了很多脑筋。由他们组成的技术监督组每天都到车间去，督促工人减少工具消耗。其实，工人们使用工具也很节省了。但是，由于车间任务增大，各车间的工具消耗数字不仅没下降，反而上升起来。
    8月底，工具科技术监督组根据工人的建议和兄弟工厂的经验，组织几名技术工人成立了工具翻新小组，在废品库里安装起机器，专门翻修各车间用废的工具。
    翻新小组能把使用短了的工具变长，薄了的变厚，细了的变粗，小了的变大，钝了的也能变得锋锐。各车间用钝的三千多把锉刀，经过钳工用盐酸、硫酸、硝酸配成液体浸煮以后，锉齿尖锐得像新的一样。这样，各车间明年一年需要的锉刀就都有了。从8月底以来，翻新小组翻新了的刃具、量具、工具和辅助工具有几万件，不仅满足了生产上的需要，还为工厂节省了三万四千多元的工具费。
