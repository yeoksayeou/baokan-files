Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th - TASS reported: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, received the Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, K. Menon, on November 29th and held talks with him. Menon handed Bulganin Indian Prime Minister Nehru's reply to Bulganin's letter of November 17th, which was accompanied by the Soviet government's statement on disarmament and easing international tensions.

Prime Minister Nehru said in his reply signed on November 27th, "I fully agree with your view that every effort must be made to reach an agreement to prevent war and ensure world peace. We are very pleased that you have put forward new ways to address the difficult issue of disarmament. We feel this is worth studying carefully. We are studying these disarmament proposals with due diligence and care."

Nehru said in the letter, "The issue of disarmament mainly concerns major powers with large armed forces and various armaments, and therefore only they can take effective action. As for us, we will be happy to do everything possible to help. It is more important than ever in the current tense international situation that these countries begin discussions in the short term on reaching a disarmament agreement."

Nehru announced that if other participating countries deem it appropriate for India to participate in these discussions, we will gladly participate.

　　尼赫鲁就裁军问题函复布尔加宁
　　对苏联提出解决裁军问题的新办法表示高兴
　　印度愿意参加商讨裁军协定问题的国际会议
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在11月29日接见了印度驻苏联大使克·梅农，并且同他进行了谈话。梅农把印度总理尼赫鲁对布尔加宁11月17日附有苏联政府关于裁军和缓和国际紧张局势问题的声明的信件的回信交给布尔加宁。
    尼赫鲁总理在他11月27日签署的回信中说，“我完全同意您的意见，必须尽一切努力达成一项协议来防止战争和保障世界和平。我们很高兴，您对裁军这个困难的问题提出了新的办法。我们觉得，这是值得细心研究的。我们正在以应有的周密仔细的态度研究这些裁军建议。
    尼赫鲁在信中说，“裁军这个问题主要涉及拥有大量武装力量和各种军备的大国，因此只有它们才能够采取有效的行动。至于我们，我们将很高兴尽我们的一切可能的努力给以帮助。这些国家之间在短期内就开始商讨达成一项裁军协定的问题，这在目前国际局势紧张的情况下比任何时候都更加重要。
    尼赫鲁宣布，如果其他参加国认为印度也参加这些讨论是适宜的话，我们将欣然参加。
