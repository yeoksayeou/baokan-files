    Don't Fleece Local Industry
    The main products of the local state-owned Harbin Small Hardware Factory are butt hinges and wood screws. These products are partly supplied to domestic capital construction units and partly exported. This year, due to the tight supply of raw materials, the factory has had to collect side scraps and waste materials for utilization.
    In September of this year, we contacted the Supply Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and asked them to help solve the problem. The Supply Bureau agreed to help, but only through barter, requiring the Small Hardware Factory to exchange scrap steel for their steel plate edges, at a ratio of 2.5 tons of scrap steel for 1 ton of steel plate edges; the scrap steel also had to be inspected and approved by them. In order to meet the domestic and foreign demand for butt hinges and wood screws as much as possible, the Small Hardware Factory had to agree. However, when contacting the Shenyang Office, which was responsible for handling the exchange, they put forward even more stringent conditions: 100 tons of scrap steel for 30 tons of scrap steel edges, with the price of each ton of steel plate edges at 440 yuan and each ton of scrap steel at 100 yuan.
    I think their practice is very wrong. Both are scrap steel, both are handed over for smelting, why is the price so different? State-owned industry has the responsibility to help local industry and support local industry in using waste materials for production. Why does the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry want to fleece local industry?

    不要揩地方工业的油
    地方国营哈尔滨小五金厂生产的主要产品是白合页和木螺丝。这些产品一部分供应国内基本建设单位，一部分出口。今年由于原材料供应紧张，厂里只好各处去收集边材废料来利用。
    今年9月间，我们找到第一机械工业部供应局，请他们协助解决。供应局答应给解决，但是必须以货易货，要求小五金厂拿废杂钢换他们的钢板边，而且要以两吨半杂钢换一吨钢板边的比例来进行交换；废杂钢还得由他们检验合格才行。为了尽量满足国内国外对白合页和木螺丝的需要，小五金厂只好同意，可是同负责办理交换事宜的沈阳办事处联系，他们又提出更加苛刻的条件：一百吨废杂钢换三十吨废钢边，价格是每吨钢板边四百四十元，每吨废杂钢为一百元。
    我认为他们这种做法是很不对的。同是废钢，一样上缴再炼，为什么价格这样悬殊？国营工业有责任帮助地方工业，支持地方工业利用废料进行生产，第一机械工业部为什么要揩地方工业的油呢？
