Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: China's industrial and health sectors have begun to use radioactive isotopes.

    In some oil fields, radioactive isotopes are being used to detect the interface between oil and water in oil wells, to inspect the quality of cement work in oil wells, and to explore oil storage in underground rock formations. Radioactive isotopes are also being used in high-temperature and high-pressure power plant projects to check the quality of welds on boilers and boiler tubes. The metallurgical department has conducted experiments using radioactive isotopes to observe the quality of steel ingot molds.

    The technology of using isotopes to treat diseases has also begun to be used in some health departments.

    The use of radioactive isotopes has significantly improved work quality and efficiency. An oil well is several thousand meters deep from the surface to the bottom of the well, and the wellbore is composed of several sets of seamless steel pipes and cement walls. When using electrical instruments to explore the situation underground and the interface between water and oil, the electrical instruments cannot reflect the true situation due to the obstruction of seamless steel pipes and thick cement walls. Now, by extending radioactive isotopes into the well, the strong radiation of the isotopes penetrates the steel pipes and cement, and the situation underground and the interface between water and oil can be correctly reflected through the instrument. Using radioactive isotopes to inspect the welds of high-temperature and high-pressure boilers and boiler tubes is much more convenient than using bulky X-ray machines. During inspection, a frame only needs to be set up in advance at the place to be inspected, a special film is placed under the weld, and then the radioactive isotope is hung on the frame. After twenty minutes, the film is taken out and developed, and the quality of the weld can be accurately known. It only takes five minutes to check the casting quality of steel ingot molds with radioactive isotopes, while the old inspection method takes at least two full days.

### 我国工业等部门开始使用放射性同位素

    我国工业等部门开始使用放射性同位素
    新华社8日讯　我国的工业和卫生事业已开始使用放射性同位素。
    在一些石油矿区里正在使用放射性同位素探测油井里石油和水的分界面，和检查油井里的水泥工程质量以及探寻地下岩层里的储油情况。高温高压发电站工程上也在使用放射性同位素检查锅炉和锅炉管子的焊缝质量。冶金部门做了用放射性同位素观察钢锭模的质量的试验。
    用同位素来治疗疾病的技术也开始在一些卫生部门使用。
    放射性同位素的利用，使得工作的质量和效率有了显著提高。一座石油井从地面到井底有几千公尺深，井身是由几套无缝钢管和水泥墙构成的。用电器仪表探寻井下情况及水和石油分界面时，由于无缝钢管和厚厚的水泥墙的阻挡，电器仪表不能反映真实情况。现在将放射性同位素伸到井里，同位素强烈的放射线穿透钢管和水泥，通过仪器可以把井下的情况及水和石油的分界面正确地反映上来。用放射性同位素检查高温高压锅炉和锅炉管子的焊缝，比用庞大的爱克斯光机检查要方便得多。检查时只要事先在要检查的地方支起一个架子，在焊缝的底下放好特制的胶卷，然后把放射性同位素挂到架上，等过二十分钟后把胶卷拿出来冲洗，就可以正确地知道焊缝的质量情况。用放射性同位素检查钢锭模的铸造质量，每次只用五分钟，而旧的检查方法至少也得两个整天。
