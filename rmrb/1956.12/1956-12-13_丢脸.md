International Notes

    Losing Face
    The British representative to the United Nations General Assembly, Dixon, said to the UN General Assembly on December 6th that "British and French forces did not use their full strength when taking over (read as invading) Port Said."
    Indeed! The British and French invaders mobilized 160,000 troops, dispatched more than 100 warships, and sent more than 2,000 jet bomber sorties to attack Egypt, fighting for a long time, only to occupy Port Said; and now they have to start withdrawing from Port Said, returning to the place where they originally launched the invasion. All this is because they "deliberately did not use their full strength."
    However, it's a bit of a shame for the British Empire. Even without "using full strength," the Prime Minister was "overly fatigued"; even without "using full strength," the national economy experienced panic; even without "using full strength," the Conservative government had to extend both hands to beg from across the Atlantic. Then, what would the result be if "full strength" was used? Dixon doesn't seem to have thought about this issue. He only cared about bragging for Britain, but ended up making Britain lose even more face!

    丢脸
    英国驻联合国大会代表狄克逊于12月6日向联合国大会说，“英法军队在接管（读作侵占）塞得港的时候故意没有用全力”。
    是啊！英法侵略者动员了十六万兵力，调遣了一百多艘军舰，出动了两千多架次喷气轰炸机去进攻埃及，打了好久，结果仅仅占领了一个塞得港；而现在又不得不开始撤出塞得港，退回到它们原来发动侵略的地方去。这一切都是因为“故意没有用全力”的原故啊。
    可是，说来大英帝国未免太不行了。还“没有用全力”，首相就“疲劳过度”了；还“没有用全力”，全国经济就发生恐慌了；还“没有用全力”，保守党政府就不得不伸出两只手向大西洋彼岸乞讨了。那末，如果使用了“全力”，结果该是怎样呢？狄克逊似乎没有想到这个问题。他只顾替英国吹嘘，结果却使英国更加丢脸！　（马）
