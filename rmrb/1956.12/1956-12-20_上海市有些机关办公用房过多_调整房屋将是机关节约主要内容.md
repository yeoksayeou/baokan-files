    Some Shanghai Municipal Organs Have Excessive Office Space
    Adjusting Housing Will Be a Major Focus of Frugality for Organs
    (Our Newspaper's Dispatch) If the Shanghai Huangpu District organs' office space is reduced by 10% to 20%, it could free up 90,000 to 180,000 square meters of housing. This area is equivalent to the total area of Shanghai's basic construction for the entire year. Freeing up this housing could save the country more than 7 million yuan in investment.
    Currently, many organs in Shanghai have situations of excessive or wide use of housing and improper use. A survey of housing in 243 units by the Municipal Government Affairs Administration Bureau initially estimated that these units used more than 38,000 square meters. The most spacious use was by the Military Service Bureau, which averaged 31 square meters per person. But they are still reaching out for more housing. In the two buildings of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China at 23 and 24 on the Bund, 19 units, totaling more than 2,600 employees, occupy more than 26,000 square meters. In these two buildings, there are more than 40 conference rooms alone. Each unit, and even each department and section, has its own conference room, library, and storage room; in addition to general rest rooms, there are rest rooms for male workers, female workers, elderly workers, guards, and communicators; besides the bank-wide "Red Hall," there are "Red Corners," activity rooms, ping-pong rooms, chess rooms, etc., truly a multitude of names. If arranged reasonably according to their existing personnel, it is initially estimated that an additional 3,000 to 4,000 square meters of housing could be freed up.
    After the adjustment of office housing in organs, it will solve the difficulties of some employees who live far from work. In Huangpu District alone, if a reasonable adjustment is made, the vacated housing could accommodate 3,000 employees, saving employees' commuting time and saving a lot of transportation costs.
    The Shanghai Municipal Housing Adjustment Committee recently held its first meeting, focusing on this issue. Cao Diqiu, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai and Director of the Housing Adjustment Committee, pointed out at the meeting that the adjustment of office housing in organs should be carried out as a major component of increasing production and practicing economy. He said: Doing this work well will not only establish a work style of diligence and thrift, but also reflect the Party and government's concern for the hardships of the masses, strengthen ties with the masses, and have significant political and economic significance in improving the lives of workers and increasing production.

    上海市有些机关办公用房过多
    调整房屋将是机关节约主要内容
    本报讯　如果把上海黄浦区机关办公房屋紧缩10％到20％，就可以腾出房屋九万到十八万平方公尺。这个面积相当于上海今年全年基本建设的全部面积。腾出这些房屋，就可以为国家节约投资七百多万元。
    目前，上海市许多机关的用屋都有过大过宽和使用不当的情况。市机关事务管理局对二百四十三个单位房屋的调查结果，初步统计这些单位多用了三万八千多平方公尺。其中用得最宽的是兵役局，该局每人平均用屋三十一平方公尺。但是他们还在伸手要房子。在外滩二十三、二十四号中国人民银行上海市分行的两幢大楼里，十九个单位，共二千六百多职工，用屋就有二万六千多平方公尺。在这两幢大楼里，单是会议室就有四十多个。每个单位、甚至每个部、处都有自己的会议室、图书室、储藏室；除了一般休息室外，还有男工、女工、老年工、警卫和通讯员等休息室；除了全行性的“红厅”，又有“红角”、活动室、乒乓室、棋牌室等等，真是名目繁多。如果按他们现有人员合理安排一下，据初步计算可多出房屋三、四千平方公尺。
    机关办公房屋调整以后，将可解决部分上班路远职工的困难。单是一个黄浦区，如果进行合理的调整，空出的房屋就可供三千职工居住，不但节省了职工们上下班的时间，还可以节约很多车费。
    上海市房屋调整委员会最近举行第一次会议，着重研究了这个问题。上海市副市长、房屋调整委员会主任曹荻秋在会上指出：机关调整办公房屋应当作为增产节约的一个主要内容来进行。他说：做好这个工作不仅能树立起克勤克俭的风气，并且也体现了党和政府对群众疾苦的关心，密切和群众的联系，在改善职工生活和提高生产等方面都具有重大的政治意义和经济意义。
