    Two Phone Calls

    The editor is calling outside to solicit articles.

    Editor: Is this Director ×'s office? I'm from the *Young Pioneers* newspaper! We would like to ask Director × to write a short article for the newspaper...

    Secretary: Ah, the *Young Pioneers*, the newspaper specifically for children! That's wonderful. It would be very meaningful to do something for our successors! But he's very busy. He rarely writes for major newspapers these days, so I'm afraid he can't spare the time to write for your small newspaper!

    Editor: Would it be possible for us to visit Director × and talk to him in person?

    Secretary: No need. I'm his secretary. I'll tell him. You can call again in two days.

    Three days later, the editor calls again.

    Editor: I'm from the *Young Pioneers* newspaper.

    Secretary: Oh, you're calling about the article. I haven't told Director × yet. But he's really too busy, so I think we should just forget about it!

    The phone was hung up again.

    一下，跟他当面谈谈？秘书：不用了，我是他的秘书，告
    诉他就是了。你们过两天再来
