According to the Anhui Daily, after hearing the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee on increasing production and practicing economy, the directly subordinate organs in Anhui Province immediately conducted investigations within their respective organizations. Preliminary investigations by each unit revealed serious waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources.

Some units pursued excessive and grandiose basic construction projects, competing in extravagance and ostentation, resulting in significant waste of state funds. For example, the Anhui Provincial Department of Health demolished straw houses to build tile-roofed houses, and then demolished the tile-roofed houses to build foreign-style tile houses, wasting manpower, materials, and financial resources. The Provincial Public Security Bureau demolished a two-story office building that had only been built in 1953 to rebuild it, but according to the spirit of thrift, it can only be a two-story building.

The waste in administrative expenses in some units is also astonishing: The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions spent 1,300 yuan to buy an expensive carpet to decorate the corridor of the office building. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative spent more than 5,000 yuan this year to buy three sets of leather sofas. The Administrative Office of the Provincial Party Committee spent more than 1,000 yuan to buy an elevator, but there was nowhere to use it; they also spent more than 700 yuan to buy three vacuum cleaners. The Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs Kindergarten spent more than 1,600 yuan to buy a large surgical kit, a high-pressure sterilizer, and a washing machine, which were shelved for several years because they were not suitable. Many units printed documents and forms without limit, causing great waste. The Labor Reform Bureau of the Provincial Public Security Bureau issued files to each person at a conference of factory directors of subordinate factories, accumulating to more than an inch thick. After the meeting, they were useless and the civil servants burned them for a long time to dispose of them. There was also great waste in the expenditures for holding meetings, renting hotels, and business travel expenses in various units. Some agencies invited guests indiscriminately, holding banquets to send off cadres who were transferred, and banquets to welcome new leaders. There was also a lot of waste in the use of cars. Staff members of the Reception Office of the Provincial People's Committee even took a small car to get a few pounds of milk or buy a few tickets; a deputy director of the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative sometimes took a small car to go to the vegetable market to buy vegetables.

After these extravagant and wasteful phenomena were exposed, they educated the leaders and the vast number of cadres. In the past, leading cadres and some cadres in some units believed: "There is no waste here, so there is nothing to save." Now, they all realize that this is a concrete manifestation of bureaucracy. Many units are continuing to investigate extravagant and wasteful phenomena. Some units have already, or are in the process of, mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate economical methods based on the wasteful loopholes that have been discovered.

### 安徽省直属机关揭发铺张浪费现象  正发动群众讨论制定节约办法

    安徽省直属机关揭发铺张浪费现象
    正发动群众讨论制定节约办法
    本报讯　据安徽日报消息：安徽省直属机关各单位，在听到八届二中全会关于增产节约的号召以后，立即对本机关进行检查。各单位初步检查以后，发现人力、物力、财力的浪费现象是严重的。
    有些单位对基本建设贪多求大，比派头，比阔气，因此造成国家资金的大大浪费。如安徽省卫生厅把草平房拆掉盖瓦平房，又把瓦平房拆掉盖洋瓦房，浪费了人力、物力、财力。省公安厅把1953年才盖的两层办公大楼拆掉重新盖，但目前根据节约精神还是只能盖两层的楼房。
    有些单位在行政经费开支方面的浪费也很惊人：省工会联合会花了一千三百元买了条贵重的地毯，用它点缀在办公大楼的走廊上。省供销合作社今年不惜花五千多元买了三套皮沙发。省委办公厅行政处用一千多元买了一架升降机，结果无处用；另外还用七百多元买了三架吸尘器。省直属机关幼儿园花了一千六百多元买的大手术包、高压消毒器和洗衣机，因为不适用，搁置了几年。许多单位漫无限制地印刷文件、表格，造成极大浪费。省公安厅劳动改造局召开所属工厂厂长会议，给每人发的文件积起来有一寸多厚，会后无用了，公务员烧了很久才烧完。各单位在召开会议、租旅社以及出差旅费等开支方面也有很大浪费。有的机关乱请客，干部调动工作，设宴欢送；新的领导同志上任，设宴欢迎。在使用汽车方面浪费也很大。省人民委员会交际处的人员甚至拿几磅牛奶、买几张车票也要坐小卧车去；省供销社有一位副主任有时到菜市去买菜也要坐小卧车。
    这些铺张浪费现象被检查出来以后，教育了领导，也教育了广大干部。过去，有些单位的领导干部和部分干部认为：“我们这里没有什么浪费，因此也无约可节。”现在，他们都认识到这是官僚主义的具体表现。许多单位仍在继续检查铺张浪费现象。有些单位已经或正在根据检查出来的浪费漏洞，发动群众讨论制定节约办法。
