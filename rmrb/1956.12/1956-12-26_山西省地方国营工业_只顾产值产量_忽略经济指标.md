Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th -- The total output value of Shanxi Province's locally-operated state-owned industries under the Industrial Department has already reached the planned level for 1957 by the end of November; the production volume of more than twenty products has also reached the target for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. However, behind this seemingly good achievement, there are other hidden situations – labor productivity is declining year by year, and costs are not meeting the plan.

The costs of Shanxi Province's locally-operated state-owned industries under the Industrial Department cannot even complete this year's plan. According to statistics from 171 enterprises, the total cost of all comparable products from January to October was 5.6% higher than the national planned target for this year, and the cost of many types of industries was even higher than the actual cost last year. Even if the cost plan is completed well in November and December, the total cost expenditure this year will exceed the national plan by about 3.7 million yuan.

Many reasons can be traced for this situation: the expenditure of increasing wages was not estimated when compiling the cost plan at the beginning of the year, the production of agricultural tools stopped halfway, the climate was not good, and transportation expenses increased. However, these objective factors cannot replace these subjective reasons, that is: low labor productivity, excessive consumption of raw materials, and excessive non-production expenditures.

Last year, the labor productivity of Shanxi's locally-operated state-owned industries was the lowest year since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, only equal to 96.9% of 1954; and this year's labor productivity is expected to only reach 93.9% of last year.

One of the reasons for low labor productivity is that enterprises have not strictly implemented the spirit of "more production with less personnel." The total industrial output value of the province is expected to increase by 20.07% this year compared with last year, while the average actual number of people from January to September increased by 26.3% compared with the average actual number of people last year. Especially in the building materials industry, taking September as an example, the actual number of people in the building industry in this month reached more than 27,000, which is more than double the same period last year. However, the total output value of the building materials industry from January to September only increased by 47.2% compared with the same period last year. The attendance rate of workers is also not high, with the attendance rate of the textile industry department only being about 80%, which makes labor productivity even more backward.

Another important reason for the increase in costs is that enterprises have the phenomenon of disregarding the consumption of raw materials. The wine output rate of the wine industry this year only completed 85% of the plan. From January to November, the average consumption of raw cotton per piece of yarn in the local state-owned textile industry exceeded the national plan by about 3.6 jin; individual yarn counts exceeded by about 10 jin.

Due to the above situation, the achievement of Shanxi's locally-operated state-owned industries in reaching the planned level of total output value for 1957 ahead of schedule cannot compensate for the losses caused by "costs going uphill and labor productivity going downhill."

According to the person in charge of the Shanxi Provincial Industrial Department, improving labor productivity and reducing costs will be important content of improving enterprise management in local state-owned industries next year. However, some enterprises and specific leading departments have not yet put this issue on the agenda.

### 山西省地方国营工业  只顾产值产量　忽略经济指标

    山西省地方国营工业
    只顾产值产量　忽略经济指标
    据新华社太原25日电　山西省工业厅所属地方国营工业的生产总值，已经在11月底提前达到1957年的计划水平；二十多种产品的产量也提前达到了第一个五年计划最后一年的指标。但是，在这种看起来很好的成绩后面，却隐藏着另外一些状况——劳动生产率逐年下降和成本完不成计划。
    山西省工业厅所属地方国营工业的成本，连今年的计划也不能完成。根据一百七十一个企业的统计，1到10月份全部可比产品的总成本比今年的国家计划指标高出5.6％，不少种类工业的成本甚至比去年的实际成本还高。11、12两月即使成本计划完成得很好，今年的成本总支出也将比国家计划超出三百七十万元左右。
    造成这种情况可以追究出许多原因：在年初编制成本计划的时候没有估计到增加工资这项支出、农具中途停产、气候不好以及运输开支加大等。但是，这些客观因素不能代替这些主观原因，那就是：劳动生产率低下，原材料消耗和非生产支出过大。
    去年，山西地方国营工业的劳动生产率是执行第一个五年计划以来最低的一年，只等于1954年的96.9％；而今年的劳动生产率预计只能达到去年的93.9％。
    劳动生产率低下的原因之一是各企业没有严格地贯彻多增产少增人的精神。全省今年工业生产总值预计可以比去年增加20.07％，而1到9月平均实有人数比去年平均实有人数增长了26.3％。特别是建筑材料工业，以9月份为例，这一个月建筑工业的实有人数达到两万七千多人，比去年同期增加了二倍以上。而建筑材料工业1到9月份的生产总值却只比去年同期增加了47.2％。工人出勤率也不高，纺织工业部门的出勤率只有80％左右，这就使得劳动生产率更加落后了。
    成本增高的另一个重要原因是各企业有不计原材料消耗的现象。制酒工业今年的出酒率只完成计划的85％。1到11月，地方国营纺织工业每件纱平均消耗的原棉比国家计划超出三点六斤左右；个别纱支有的超出十斤左右。
    由于上述情况，山西地方国营工业提前达到1957年生产总值计划水平的成就，就弥补不了由于“成本走上坡路、劳动生产率走下坡路”所造成的损失。
    据山西省工业厅负责人说，提高劳动生产率和降低成本将是明年地方国营工业改进企业管理的重要内容。但是，有一些企业和具体领导部门，现在还没有把这个问题提到议事日程上来。
