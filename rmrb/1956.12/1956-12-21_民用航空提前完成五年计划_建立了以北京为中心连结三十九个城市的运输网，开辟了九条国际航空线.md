Xinhua News Agency, December 20th - China's civil air transport has fulfilled its first Five-Year Plan one year and fifteen days ahead of schedule.

According to statistics from the Civil Aviation Administration of China, as of December 15th, the total passenger and freight turnover of the Civil Aviation Administration this year reached more than 17 million ton-kilometers, exceeding the planned target for the final year of the first Five-Year Plan by 3.8%. The four indicators for passenger, cargo (including mail) transport volume and passenger and cargo turnover specified in the Five-Year Plan for 1957 have also been overfulfilled.

In the process of fulfilling the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, China's civil aviation pilots have consistently maintained a good record of safe flying.

In the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, civil aviation opened up many new routes. Now, China has established an air transport network centered on Beijing, connecting thirty-nine cities from Qiqihar in Heilongjiang Province in the north to Haikou in Hainan Island in the south, from Kashgar in Xinjiang in the west to Shanghai in the east. Nine international air routes, including China-Soviet Union, China-Vietnam, and China-Burma, have also been established successively, and intermodal transport has been established with many countries around the world. Currently, China has more than 19,000 kilometers of air routes, an increase of 45.4% compared to 1952. In addition, routes from Beijing to Lhasa on the Tibetan Plateau and from Beijing to Taldin in the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai Province have also been successfully test flown this year.

Along with the increase in routes, many aircraft have also been added. Calculated by aircraft deadweight tonnage, the current figure is more than 80% higher than in 1952. New communication and navigation aid equipment to ensure flight safety has also been correspondingly added to various routes and stations. A modern airport equipped with the latest technology is under construction in the vicinity of Beijing. After the first phase of the airport is completed next year, all types of aircraft will be able to take off and land here day and night.

    民用航空提前完成五年计划
    建立了以北京为中心连结三十九个城市的运输网，开辟了九条国际航空线
    据新华社20日讯　我国民用航空运输提前一年零十五天完成了第一个五年计划。
    据民用航空局统计，到12月15日止，今年民航局客货运输总周转量达到一千七百多万吨公里，超过第一个五年计划最后一年计划指标的3.8％。五年计划规定的1957年旅客、货物（包括邮件）运输量和旅客、货物的周转量四个指标，也都超额完成。
    在提前完成五年计划中，我国民用航空的飞行人员还一直保持着安全飞行的良好纪录。
    在五年计划的头四年中，民用航空开辟了许多新的航线。现在，我国已经建立了一个以北京为中心的，北自黑龙江省的齐齐哈尔，南到海南岛的海口，西起新疆的喀什，东到上海连结着三十九个城市的航空运输网。中国——苏联、中国——越南和中国——缅甸等九条国际航空线也已经先后建立起来，并且同世界许多国家建立了联运。现在我国已经有航空线一万九千多公里，比1952年增长45.4％。另外，由北京到西藏高原的拉萨和由北京到青海省柴达木盆地的塔尔丁等航线，也在今年试航成功。
    和增加航线的同时，还增添了许多飞机。按飞机载重吨位计算，现在比1952年增加了80％以上。在各航线和港站上，还相应地增加了保证飞行安全的新式通信助航设备。在北京近郊正在兴建一个用最新的技术装备起来的现代化的航空港。这个航空港的第一期工程在明年完工后，各种类型的飞机都可以日夜在这里起飞和降落。
