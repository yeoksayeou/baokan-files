Xinhua News Agency, Mangshi, December 16th: The Sino-Burmese Border People's Friendship Gathering, marking a further consolidation and development of Sino-Burmese friendship, was held in Mangshi this afternoon.

Today, white clouds floated in the azure sky above the Mangshi坝子 (壩子 is a local term for a flat open space). The Chinese and Burmese national flags and dozens of red flags on the assembly square fluttered in the wind. The two slogan towers erected on both sides of the rostrum were inscribed with twelve large characters: "Long Live Sino-Burmese Friendship" and "Long Live World Peace." In accordance with ethnic customs, sugar cane, banana trees, and pine trees, symbolizing peace, friendship, and auspiciousness, were planted on both sides of the rostrum. In the center of the rostrum hung the national flags of China and Burma, and large portraits of President Ba U and Chairman Mao Zedong.

More than 15,000 residents from both sides of the border, carrying Chinese and Burmese national flags and playing dozens of pairs of elephant-foot drums, joyfully arrived at the square from 1:00 PM onwards. Here were not only Dai people from the vicinity of Mangshi and Jingpo people who had traveled from 300 *li* away, but also Lahu people who had come from afar and Shan and Kachin friends from Burma. The Chinese Dai and Burmese Shan, the Chinese Jingpo and Burmese Kachin sitting side by side in the venue, although residing in two different countries, are of the same ethnicity. They have had kinship ties since ancient times. Today, they gathered together to jointly participate in this conference of significant importance in the history of Sino-Burmese relations.

At 3:05 PM, Prime Minister U Ba Swe, Premier Zhou Enlai, Burmese Deputy Prime Minister Sao Khun Kyi, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, and Chinese Deputy Premier He Long, among others, stepped onto the rostrum amidst thunderous cheers. At this moment, tens of thousands of red flags were waved. The square transformed into a sea of joy.

After the conference began, Liu Minghui, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province, delivered a speech first. He expressed his heartfelt respect and warm welcome to the leaders of the two governments on behalf of the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee and the people of all ethnic groups in the province. After narrating the traditional friendship between the people of all ethnic groups in the Yunnan border region and the people of the Burmese border region, he said, "In the future, our Yunnan Province will continue to earnestly implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, respect the historical customs of the border people on both sides, enhance mutual friendship and exchanges, and develop economic and cultural ties between the two border regions."

Prime Minister U Ba Swe of the Union of Burma spoke at the conference (full text on page 4). He narrated the traditional friendship between Burma and China and the achievements made in implementing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said: This conference has laid another cornerstone for Burmese-Chinese friendship. The friendship between the people of the two countries living in the border areas will surely gain obvious development and improvement. Prime Minister U Ba Swe also said: Let us once again express our determination to strive for the continued successful implementation of the Five Principles. May the two Burmese and Chinese nations, which have historically had the same national self-esteem and have successfully maintained their national cultures, handle various issues with tolerance and generosity. Let the people of Burma and China, with a friendly neighborly attitude and mutual trust, jointly prevent interference from foreign conspiracies.

After he finished speaking, the people of all ethnic groups stood up and applauded, waving flags and cheering for Prime Minister U Ba Swe for several minutes.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke (full text on page 4). He said: Holding such a border people's friendship gathering to establish broader and closer direct contact between the border people of China and Burma is of great significance for promoting the friendship and unity of the people of China and Burma. Premier Zhou Enlai said: As long as the governments and people of our two countries firmly adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and treat each other with sincerity, our mutual understanding and trust will increase day by day, and all issues between us can be gradually resolved fairly and reasonably. Premier Zhou said: The same fraternal ethnic groups live on the borders of our two countries, and there are many representatives of such fraternal ethnic groups present here today. Their long-standing and sincere traditional relations are of particular importance to the development of friendship between China and Burma. He said that in order to further develop the friendly and cooperative relations between the border people of the two countries, the Chinese border people should make greater efforts than the Burmese border people. Because China is a populous country, we should take more proactive measures to prove with practical actions our consistent and unwavering adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We must always be modest, prudent, and patient with the people of our friendly neighbors, and resolutely oppose great-power chauvinism. As long as we maintain this attitude, the friendship between the border people of our two countries and between the people of the two countries will be continuously consolidated and continuously enhanced.

Premier Zhou's speech aroused prolonged applause from the people of all ethnic groups. People played elephant-foot drums and cheered incessantly.

U Zanhta Sin, Chief of Kachin State of Burma, Subi, Deputy Chief of Shan State, Dao Jingban, Governor of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, and Lei Chunguo, Deputy Governor of Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, also spoke at the conference successively. Their speeches expressed their aspirations to strive to enhance the friendly relations between the people of the Chinese and Burmese border regions.

After their speeches ended, the two prime ministers and 15,000 people of all ethnic groups jointly watched ethnic song and dance performances and acrobatics performed by various literary and art groups in Yunnan Province.

    中缅边境人民联欢大会在芒市举行
    新华社芒市16日电　标志着中缅两国友谊进一步巩固和发展的中缅两国边境人民联欢大会，今天下午在芒市举行。
    今天，芒市坝子蔚蓝色天空中飘浮着朵朵白云。大会广场上的中缅两国国旗和几十面红旗迎风招展。耸立在主席台两旁的两个标语塔上写着“中缅友谊万岁”“世界和平万岁”十二个大字。按照民族习惯，主席台两侧栽上了象征和平友谊和吉祥的甘蔗、芭蕉和松树。大会主席台正中，悬挂着中缅两国国旗和巴宇总统、毛泽东主席的巨幅画像。
    两国边境的居民一万五千多人从下午一时就举着中缅两国的国旗，敲着几十对象脚鼓，欢天喜地地来到广场上。这里，不仅有芒市附近的傣族和从三百里以外赶来的景颇族人，也有不远千里而来的拉祜族人和来自缅甸的掸族、克钦族朋友。并肩坐在会场上的中国傣族和缅甸的掸族、中国的景颇族和缅甸的克钦族，虽然居住在两个国家里，但都是同一个民族。他们之间自古以来就有着亲戚关系。今天他们欢聚在一起，共同参加这个在中缅关系史上有重要意义的大会。
    下午三时零五分，吴巴瑞总理、周恩来总理、缅甸联邦藻昆卓副总理、吴觉迎副总理及我国贺龙副总理等，在雷动的欢呼声中走上主席台。这时候，上万面红旗挥舞起来。广场上形成一片欢乐的海洋。
    大会开始后，云南省代省长刘明辉首先致词。他代表云南省人民委员会和全省各族人民对于两国政府领导人的到来表示衷心的敬意和热烈的欢迎。在叙述了云南边境地区各族人民同缅甸边境人民之间的传统友谊后，他说：“我们云南省今后将继续认真地贯彻执行和平共处的五项原则，尊重双方边民的历史习惯，增进互相间的友谊往来，发展两国边境间的经济与文化联系。”
    缅甸联邦吴巴瑞总理在大会上讲话（全文见第四版）。他叙述了缅中两国的传统友谊和执行和平共处五项原则所取得的成就。他说：这次大会又为缅中友好打下了一块基石。在边境地区生活的两国人民的友好也必将会获得明显发展和改善。吴巴瑞总理又说：让我们再一次表示为继续成功地执行五项原则而努力的决心，愿历史上一向有相同的民族自尊心并成功地保持着民族文化的缅中两个民族，同舟共济地、宽宏大量地处理各项问题，让我们缅中两国人民以友好邻邦的态度和相互信任的精神，一起防止外来阴谋的干涉。
    他讲完话以后，各族人民起立鼓掌，挥舞着旗帜向吴巴瑞总理欢呼达数十分钟。
    周恩来总理接着讲话（全文见第四版）。他说：举行这样的边民联欢大会，让中缅两国边民之间建立更广泛和密切的直接接触，对于促进中缅两国人民的友好、团结是具有重大的意义的。周恩来总理说：只要我们两国政府和人民坚决信守和平共处的五项原则，彼此以诚相见，我们的相互了解和信任就会日益增进，我们之间一切问题就都可以逐步求得公平合理的解决。周总理说：在我们两国边境上居住着同样的兄弟民族，今天在座就有不少这样的兄弟民族的代表。他们之间的悠久淳厚的传统关系，对发展中缅两国的友谊具有特殊重大的意义。他说，为了进一步发展两国边境人民的友好合作关系，中国的边境人民应该比缅甸的边境人民作出更大的努力。由于中国是一个人口众多的国家，我们应该采取更多的主动措施，以实际行动来证明我们对和平共处的五项原则的一贯信守不渝。对于我们友好邻邦的人民，我们要永远谦虚谨慎和耐心，坚决反对大国沙文主义。只要我们抱着这样的态度，我们两国边民之间以及两国人民之间的友谊就会不断地巩固，不断地增进。
