Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: The "Truth" newspaper published on the 10th a dispatch from its reporter in Budapest, entitled: "The Hungarian Government's Resolute and Firm Actions."

The reporter stated that the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government is now taking a series of resolute measures to fight against counter-revolutionaries. The government authorities' measures have received the support of residents. The hidden reactionaries, knowing that these measures are not in their favor, have become panicked. Leaflets with provocative slogans have reappeared at intersections. Hostile elements who have infiltrated workers' committees in some enterprises are inciting a general strike. The "Radio Free Europe" is again agitating for a general strike.

A small group of provocateurs who wormed their way into the workers' committee incited a strike at the Ganz factory. The provocateurs used deceitful means to stop the work of the enterprise. But they felt this was not enough. They decided to go to the Csepel Iron and Steel Works to create a strike. However, the workers of Csepel resolutely rejected the coercion of the hostile elements. The attempt to shut down all enterprises in Budapest failed.

At this time, the Budapest Central Workers' Council stepped onto the stage. It vainly attempted to lead not only the capital but also the masses of working people across the country. This committee was thrown into chaos by a gang of villains who tried every possible means to obstruct the restoration of order in the country. The members of the Central Workers' Council presented a memorandum to the Premier of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, Comrade Kádár, the day before yesterday, threatening to hold a general strike. Comrade Kádár told the representatives of the committee that the two-faced policy of the Central Workers' Council's leadership would inevitably lead to destruction. Comrade Kádár said, however, that the government would never allow this, and it was not the people who were heading for destruction, but only individuals. The government has enough strength and methods to deal with traitors.

In order to try to sharpen the situation, the Budapest Central Workers' Council convened an enlarged meeting. However, there were serious differences of opinion among the speakers at the meeting. Contrary to the expectations of the reactionaries, the majority opposed holding a strike. It was decided at that time to hold another meeting. At the meeting, the arrogance of the provocateurs and agitators grew stronger and stronger. The Central Workers' Council, despite the protests of many people against the strike, decided to hold a general strike for forty-eight hours starting on December 11th. (This is exactly what "Radio Free Europe" demanded.)

After learning of this decision of the Budapest Central Workers' Council, the Workers' Committee of the Csepel Iron and Steel Works decided to continue working regardless of the results of negotiations between the Central Workers' Council and the government, and regardless of the decision of the Central Workers' Council. Workers' committees of other enterprises in the capital also expressed the same attitude. This put the Budapest Central Workers' Council in a dilemma. The committee itself began to have differences. Many representatives of this organization began to say that they were not capable of leading the masses of workers. Ninety-five percent of the workers who met with representatives of the committee accused the members of the Central Workers' Council of selling out the interests of the working class. Because the decision of the Central Workers' Council to hold a general strike created a certain tense atmosphere in some enterprises, agitators are now spreading rumors that the Hungarian government is carrying out arrests and large-scale repression.

When Hungarian Minister of State Marosan spoke about this issue at a press conference for foreign reporters on the 7th, he said: Now the enemy is scaring people with a general strike. Of course, this is impossible to achieve. But in order for the United Nations to re-discuss the Hungarian issue, something must be done. There must be one or two incidents every day in order to stir up a clamor about the Hungarian events in the United Nations. In the future, the Hungarian People's Police will act decisively. Conspirators will not forget now that the Hungarian authorities have taken strong and decisive action. This should help to fully restore order.

The Hungarian authorities stated that honest people who are loyal to the motherland and loyal to the people will not be arrested, and this will continue to be the case in the future. However, the counter-revolutionary bandits and criminals who robbed homes and shops in Budapest, murdered peaceful residents, and ran amok will not escape punishment.

    匈政府采取坚决措施打击反革命
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”10日刊载了它的记者自布达佩斯发回来的一篇通讯，题目是：“匈牙利政府的果断坚定的行动”。
    记者报道说，匈牙利工农革命政府现在正采取一系列坚决措施和反革命分子进行斗争。政府当局的措施得到了居民的支持。暗藏的反动分子知道这些措施对于他们不利，已经惊慌起来。十字街口又出现了写有挑拨煽动性口号的传单。在某些企业中混入工人委员会的敌对分子煽动总罢工。“自由欧洲”电台又在鼓动总罢工。
    一小撮钻入工人委员会的挑拨分子在甘兹工厂煽动了罢工。挑拨分子用欺骗工人的手段停止了这个企业的工作。但是他们觉得这还不够。他们决定到切佩尔冶金联合工厂去制造罢工。但是切佩尔的工人坚决拒绝了敌对分子的胁迫。想使布达佩斯全部企业停工的企图失败了。
    这时，布达佩斯中央工人委员会登台了。它妄图不仅领导首都而且领导全国的劳动人民群众。这个委员会被一些千方百计阻挠国内恢复秩序的罪恶之徒搞得乱七八糟。中央工人委员会委员在前天向工农革命政府总理卡达尔提出备忘录，威胁说要举行总罢工。卡达尔同志对这个委员会的代表说，中央工人委员会领导机构的两面派政策势将导致毁灭。卡达尔同志说，但是，政府决不容许这样，走向毁灭的不是人民，只是个别的人。政府有足够的力量和方法来对付叛徒。
    布达佩斯中央工人委员会为了力图使局势尖锐化，召开了扩大会议。但是会上发言者的意见发生严重的分歧。出乎反动分子预料之外，大多数人反对举行罢工。当时就决定再举行一次会议。会上，挑衅分子和煽动分子气焰愈来愈盛。中央工人委员会不顾许多人发言抗议罢工，决定从12月11日起举行总罢工四十八小时。（“自由欧洲”电台也正是这样要求的。）
    切佩尔冶金联合工厂工人委员会在得悉布达佩斯中央工人委员会的这个决定之后，决定不管中央工人委员会同政府的谈判的结果如何，不顾中央工人委员会的决定，继续进行工作。首都其他企业的工人委员会也表示了同样的态度。这就使布达佩斯中央工人委员会陷于进退两难的地步。委员会本身开始发生分歧。这个机构的许多代表开始说：他们没有能力领导工人群众。同委员会代表会晤的工人有95％指责中央工人委员会委员出卖工人阶级的利益。由于中央工人委员会决定总罢工后，若干企业发生某种紧张气氛，煽动分子现在造谣说匈牙利政府正在进行逮捕和大规模的镇压。
    匈牙利国务部长马罗山7日在外国记者招待会上谈到这个问题的时候说：现在敌人用总罢工来吓唬人。当然，这是没法实现的。但是为了要联合国重新讨论匈牙利问题，不能不搞点什么出来。必须每天有一两场风波，才能够在联合国里掀起关于匈牙利事件的叫嚷。今后，匈牙利人民警察机关将要坚决行动。阴谋分子现在已经不会忘记，匈牙利当局已经采取了坚强的、果断的行动。这点应当有助于完全恢复秩序。
    匈牙利当局声明，凡是忠于祖国、忠于人民的正直的人，决不会遭到逮捕，今后也还是如此。但是，抢劫过布达佩斯的住宅和商店、杀害过和平居民、逞凶肆虐过的反革命匪帮分子和罪犯将逃不了惩办。
