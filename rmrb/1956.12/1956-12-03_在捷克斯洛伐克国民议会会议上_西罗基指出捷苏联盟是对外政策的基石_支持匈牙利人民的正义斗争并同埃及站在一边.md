Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 2nd. The session of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic, which opened on November 29th, closed yesterday in Prague.

After two days of discussions, the meeting passed laws on employee health insurance and social insurance, laws on work-related injury compensation and medical expenses, benefits for the sick, and preferential treatment subsidies, as well as laws amending income taxes for cooperatives and other organizations.

On the final day of the meeting, Republic Premier Viliam Široký delivered a report on the current international situation. When discussing the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt, he said that the Czechoslovak government's view on the imperialist aggression against Egypt and the development of the entire Near East situation is clear and definite. From the very beginning of the so-called "Suez Crisis," the Czechoslovak government and people have firmly stood on the side of justice, on the side of Egypt. The government has emphasized more than once that the Suez issue can and should be resolved peacefully through negotiations with strict respect for Egyptian sovereignty. The Czechoslovak government believes that the most important thing at present is that all armed forces of the aggressors should be quickly withdrawn from Egyptian territory.

Široký also spoke about the Hungarian incident. He said that due to the great losses caused by the counter-revolution, it will take the Hungarian people considerable time and effort to fully return to normal, and it will also require assistance from democratic countries.

Široký said, "We deeply sympathize with the heroic sons and daughters of the Hungarian working class, who timely recognized the grave danger and took resolute measures to prevent it. We also deeply sympathize with the Soviet Union and its heroic army, which, at the request of the Hungarian government and in full accordance with existing agreements and principles of international law, helped the Hungarian people defeat the counter-revolution. The Czechoslovak government believes that this assistance was not only timely and justified, but also absolutely necessary and inevitable."

In concluding his speech, Široký pointed out that the path Czechoslovakia is taking now is the path of building socialism, the only correct path to further prospering our country's economy, politics, and culture.

Eternal friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union was and is the cornerstone of our foreign policy. The Czechoslovak government will continue to develop and strengthen friendly relations with all people's democratic countries with the same sincerity in the future, because our interests are consistent and inseparable.

    在捷克斯洛伐克国民议会会议上
　　西罗基指出捷苏联盟是对外政策的基石
  　支持匈牙利人民的正义斗争并同埃及站在一边
    新华社布拉格2日电　11月29日开幕的捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会会议昨天在布拉格闭幕。
    会议经过两天讨论后通过了有关职工健康保险和社会保险法案，工伤补助和医疗费用、病人福利和优抚金补助法案，修改合作社和其他组织的所得税的法律的法案。
  在最后一天会议上，共和国总理西罗基作了关于目前国际局势问题的报告。他在谈到英国、法国、以色列对埃及的侵略的时候说，捷克斯洛伐克政府对于帝国主义侵略埃及和整个近东形势发展的观点是清楚而肯定的。早在所谓“苏伊士危机”一开始的时候，捷克斯洛伐克政府和人民就坚定地站在正义这一边，站在埃及这一边。政府曾经不止一次地强调指出，苏伊士问题可以也应当在严格地尊重埃及主权的条件下通过谈判和平解决。捷克斯洛伐克政府认为，目前最重要的是侵略者的所有武装部队应该迅速撤出埃及领土。
    西罗基还谈到了匈牙利事件。他说，由于反革命造成了巨大的损失，匈牙利要完全恢复正常，还需要匈牙利人民不少时间和努力，还需要民主国家的援助。
    西罗基说，我们非常同情匈牙利工人阶级的英勇儿女，他们及时地认清了严重的危险而且采取了坚决的措施来防止它。我们也非常同情苏联和它的英雄的军队，它应匈牙利政府的请求，完全根据现有的协定和国际法原则帮助匈牙利人民击溃反革命。捷克斯洛伐克政府认为这种帮助不仅是适时的，是有根据的，而且是完全必要的和不可避免的。
    西罗基在结束自己的演说的时候指出，捷克斯洛伐克现在所走的道路是建设社会主义的道路，是进一步繁荣我国经济、政治和文化的唯一正确的道路。
    同伟大的苏联永远友好和联盟过去是、现在也是我们对外政策的基石。捷克斯洛伐克政府今后还将同样真诚地发展和加强同所有人民民主国家的友好关系，因为我们的利益是一致的，是不可分离的。
