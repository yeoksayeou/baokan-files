    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 13th. The Chinese National People's Congress Delegation and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee Delegation left Bratislava by special train on the evening of the 11th and arrived in Gottwaldov on the morning of the 12th.

    On the evening of the 11th, Strechaj, Chairman of the Slovak Administrative Committee, held a farewell reception for the delegation. The reception was full of joy and friendship.

    In his speech at the reception, Strechaj said that the workers and peasants of Czechoslovakia have a cordial and sincere friendship with the Chinese people, and they watch the great achievements of the Chinese people with admiration.

    Strechaj especially praised the achievements made by China in agricultural cooperation, and said that we still need to do more work to catch up with you in the work of agricultural collectivization.

    He said that the strength of the socialist camp is growing stronger and stronger, and the friendship between the fraternal countries is constantly being consolidated. The imperialists want to undermine the relations between us by causing mutual distrust, which will never be fruitful.

    Strechaj said that the Czechoslovak people support the struggle of all progressive forces in the world, support China's restoration of its legitimate seat in the United Nations, and support China's liberation of Taiwan.

    Li Jishen, acting head of the delegation, said in his speech that we have a common understanding, that is: history has proved and is proving that the socialist road of the October Revolution is completely correct. If imperialism attempts to conspire to seize the fruits of socialism, we will not hesitate to defend it with blood.

    He said that the friendship between the Chinese and Czech peoples is higher than the highest mountain, the Tatra Mountains, in Slovakia, and longer than the Danube River, which flows through eight countries. We will always unite together and work hand in hand for a common cause.

    On the morning of the 11th, the delegation visited the Bratislava Artificial Fiber Factory and the Wood Fiber Research Institute. In the afternoon, some members of the delegation visited the Biskupice United Agricultural Cooperative.
