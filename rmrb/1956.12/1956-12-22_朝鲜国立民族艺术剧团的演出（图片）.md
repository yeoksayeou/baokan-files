The Korean National Folk Art Troupe of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has already performed thirty-four shows in Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Wuhan and other places since coming to China. The Korean artists' performances of the Korean folk classical works "Chunhyangjeon" and "Simcheongjeon" with a strong national style have aroused great interest among Chinese audiences.

"Chunhyangjeon"

Depicts the steadfast love of a young couple, exposes the licentious and shameless life of feudal nobles, and expresses the strong character of Korean women who do not succumb to violence.

It is said that three hundred years ago, in Namwon-fu, Jeolla Province, Korea, there was a girl named Chunhyang. On the Dragon Boat Festival, she met Yi Mong-ryong, the son of the local magistrate, and the two fell in love with each other. One day, Mong-ryong came to Chunhyang's house to propose. Chunhyang's mother, Wolmae, seeing his sincerity, agreed to Chunhyang's lifelong commitment. However, the good times did not last long. In the autumn of the following year, his father took Mong-ryong to the capital, but firmly refused to take Chunhyang with him. No matter how solid Chunhyang and Mong-ryong's love was, they could not escape the shackles of feudalism. They had to part with pain. Not long after, a new magistrate, Byeon Hak-do, came to Namwon-fu, and his tyranny forced Chunhyang to serve him. Chunhyang resolutely resisted, and Byeon Hak-do was furious, severely tortured Chunhyang, and threw her into prison.

Yi Mong-ryong, who went to the capital, studied hard and was appointed as "Royal Secret Inspector of Jeolla Province" after passing the imperial examination to inspect various counties. One day, Mong-ryong disguised himself as a beggar and came to Namwon Road to conduct secret visits. When Wolmae, who had been praying day and night, hoping that Mong-ryong would come to rescue Chunhyang, saw Mong-ryong who had become a beggar, she was surprised and delighted, and led him to see Chunhyang in prison. The next day, Byeon Hak-do celebrated his birthday, happily feasting on guests, when he suddenly heard a loud cry outside the gate, "The Royal Inspector is coming!" The sound was like a thunderbolt. Byeon Hak-do was finally dismissed from his post, the wronged prisoners were released, and Chunhyang was finally reunited with Mong-ryong, whom she had been longing for day and night.

	On the Dragon Boat Festival, Chunhyang was celebrating the festival with the girls in front of Gwanghallu when she met Yi Mong-ryong, and the two fell in love at first sight.

	Mong-ryong followed Wolmae to the prison to visit Chunhyang.

	On a moonlit night, Chunhyang pouring wine and Mong-ryong raising his glass, vowed their love for each other.

"Simcheongjeon"

It is also a classical opera that tells the story of an impoverished old man in Peach Blossom Village, Hwangju County, Hwanghae Province, Korea, who is blind. He has only one filial daughter, Simcheong. The old man hoped to regain his sight and promised a monk to donate three hundred bushels of rice to the Buddha. But where could the poor old man get the rice? At this time, there happened to be several merchants who, for safe passage across the sea, were willing to pay three hundred bushels of rice to buy a girl to be sacrificed to the sea god. The filial Simcheong sold herself. On the raging sea, the merchants ordered Simcheong to jump into the water. Because of Simcheong's sincere filial piety, the Jade Emperor was moved and ordered the Dragon King to treat her generously and then send her back to the human world. Simcheong sat in a strange and fragrant "Descending Immortal Flower" and was picked up by the boatmen at sea and presented to the king, becoming the queen. Later, the king was also deeply moved by her filial piety and held a hundred-day banquet for the blind people of the whole country to find out the whereabouts of her father. At the banquet, Simcheong saw her father. At the moment of extreme excitement, the old man unexpectedly opened his eyes and saw his biological daughter for the first time; all the blind people also opened their eyes and saw the light from the darkness.

This mythical story, through Simcheong's love for her father, shows the virtues of the Korean people; at the same time, it shows that although the Korean people were in a dark society in the past, they still had very beautiful fantasies and hopes.

	The sea is vast, with raging winds and waves. Simcheong made her last prayer for her father to regain his sight as soon as possible, and then plunged into the raging waves.

	It's best if dawn comes a little later, and the rooster crows a little later, because the pitiful Simcheong is about to say goodbye to her father forever.

	Simcheong returned to the human world from the "Descending Immortal Flower".

	After all kinds of hardships, the old man Sim walked into the capital on the last day of the blind people's banquet. When Simcheong took his hands and called out "Dad," unexpectedly, the old man Sim suddenly opened his eyes and saw his beloved daughter and all things in the world for the first time in his life.

The performing talents of the Korean artists attract every audience.

	The Dragon King sent the filial daughter Simcheong back to the human world, and the officials and palace maids of the Dragon Palace also warmly came to see her off.

	The actors of the Harbin Pingju Troupe presented flowers to the Korean artists to express their gratitude and took a group photo.

	Our reporters Gao Liang and Wang Zhiyuan took the photos.

    朝鲜国立民族艺术剧团的演出
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国立民族艺术剧团来中国后，已经在北京、南京、上海、杭州、广州和武汉等地演出了三十四场。朝鲜的艺术家们以浓厚的民族风格演出的朝鲜民族古典作品“春香传和“沈清传”引起了中国观众很大的兴趣。
    “春香传”
    描写一对青年男女的坚贞的爱情，暴露封建贵族荒淫无耻的生活，并表现了朝鲜妇女不为暴力所屈服的坚强性格。
    相传三百年前，朝鲜全罗道南原府有一个春香姑娘，端阳节那天，她结识了当地使道的公子李梦龙，二人互倾爱慕之心。一天，梦龙来到春香家求婚。春香母月梅见他诚挚，就同意和春香订下了百年佳约。谁知好景不长，第二年秋天，父亲带梦龙上京，却坚决不准带春香同去。尽管春香和梦龙的爱情是多么巩固，终究摆脱不了封建的束缚。他们不得不忍痛分离。不久，南原府来了新府使卞学道，暴政恶行并强迫春香来侍寝。春香坚决反抗，卞学道大怒，将春香严刑拷打，投入狱中。
    进京的李梦龙，发奋读书，考中科举之后，被任为“全罗御史”巡察各县。一日，梦龙乔装乞丐，来到南原路上暗行私访。当着日夜祈祷、盼望梦龙来救春香的月梅看到变成了乞丐的梦龙，又惊又喜，便领他到狱中见了春香。第二天，卞学道做寿，兴高采烈，大宴宾客，忽听官门外大呼“御史出道”，声如霹雳。卞学道终于被封库罢职，含冤的犯人们都被释放，春香终于和日夜盼望的梦龙团圆了。
    端阳节那天，春香正和少女们在广寒楼前欢度节日的时候，遇见了李梦龙，二人一见钟情。
    春香和梦龙团圆的一个场面。
    梦龙随月梅来到狱中探望春香。
    一个月明如镜的夜晚，把盏斟酒的春香和高举酒杯的梦龙，共誓恩爱。
    “沈清传”
    也是一个古典唱剧，它叙说朝鲜黄海道黄州郡的桃花洞有一个双目失明的贫苦老人，他仅有一个孝顺的女儿沈清。老人期待自己重见光明，答应和尚向佛爷捐贡三百石米，可是穷苦的老人哪里有米呢？这时恰巧有几个商人，为了安全过海，愿出米三百石买个姑娘，供作海神的祭物，孝顺的沈清便把自身卖了。在狂滔的海上，商人令沈清跳入水中。由于沈清至诚的孝心，玉皇大帝被感动了，就命龙王盛情款待后再把她送回人间。沈清坐在奇异芳香的“降仙花”里，为海上船夫捞起献给了国王，做了王妃。后来国王也深深地被她的孝行所感动，为她举办全国盲人百日宴会来探听她父亲的下落。在宴会中，沈清见到了父亲，在极度兴奋的时刻，老人出乎意外地睁开了眼睛，第一次看到亲生的女儿；所有的盲人也睁开了眼睛，从黑暗里见到了光明。
    这个神话故事，通过沈清对她父亲的爱，表现了朝鲜人民的美德；同时也看出了朝鲜人民虽然在过去黑暗的社会里，他们还是有着非常美丽的幻想和希望。
    大海茫茫，狂风巨浪。沈清最后一次祷告父亲早日复明，就投进了汹涌的巨浪中。
    天最好慢一些发白，鸡最好晚一些啼叫，因为可怜的沈清就要和父亲永别了。
    沈清从“降仙花”里返回了人间。
    沈老人历经千辛万苦，在盲人宴会的最后一天走进了京城，当沈清拉着他的双手叫唤着“爸爸”的时候，出乎意外，沈老人突然睁开了眼睛，生平第一次看见了他最心爱的女儿和人间万物。
    朝鲜艺术家们的表演才能，吸引着每一个观众。
    功勋演员，由左至右：赵相鲜、林素香、金振鸣、丁南希。
    龙王把孝女沈清送回人间，龙宫的官吏和宫女们也热情地来欢送。
