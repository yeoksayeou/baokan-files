　　In the Process of Consolidation
　　By our reporter Hu Jibang
    It should be affirmed that the situation in Hungary is developing towards a healthy and normal direction day by day. We should also remember that the revolutionary worker-peasant regime was born in the storm of capitalist and fascist restoration, and was re-established after all state institutions had disintegrated or been paralyzed. Thus, it is not difficult to imagine that its growth and consolidation must go through many arduous struggles. Up to now, the remaining forces of the counter-revolution have not been completely eliminated, and they are looking for every gap in the new regime and using various forms to carry out frantic struggles.
    The resumption of production movement, which is of decisive significance for consolidating the new regime, has recently been improving in various enterprises. An even more important sign is that the labor morale of workers has risen significantly in the past week. The desire to work and abandon strikes has become a common sentiment among employees loyal to the new regime. The lives of urban residents are also gradually returning to normal. Workers are gradually turning to the government. All this makes the class enemies feel very uneasy, so in the past few days, counter-revolutionaries have created a series of provocations and rumors, attempting to further complicate the situation.
    On December 4, the one-month anniversary of the establishment of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and the entry of Soviet troops into the city, the enemy incited women to demonstrate in the streets on this day, attempting to provoke the Soviet troops through the women. On the 4th, about 2,500 women marched in batches across Heroes' Square to lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. These teams were mainly knowledgeable women living in the city center.
    As everyone knows, many families have suffered pain from casualties, destruction, and the separation of children in the past riots. In addition to expressing their grief, they did not do what the enemy had hoped. The Hungarian police not only did not obstruct the marching women, but also protected them, allowing them to return home safely. On this day, London's radio fabricated a rumor that 100,000 women were demonstrating and were dispersed by Soviet tanks, and that one woman was killed.
    December is a month full of festive atmosphere in Europe. Counter-revolutionaries are unwilling to let residents live a peaceful and happy life, and want to continue to use the people as tools for their own manipulation. In the past few days, various leaflets have appeared:
    A week ago, residents were warned that an armed riot would be held on December 6, instigating residents to purchase a large amount of food in preparation, and to send the old and young to the countryside. The counter-revolutionaries themselves also understood that it was impossible to launch an armed riot, so before December 6, on the 5th, they issued another leaflet, falsely claiming that the United Nations would soon send a plenipotentiary representative to the Austro-Hungarian border to establish contact with them, which would change the status quo in Hungary. This step should be awaited, and therefore it was decided to change the date of the riot on the 6th to December 15. Since the counter-revolutionaries' conspiracy has been exposed, I think it should be postponed indefinitely before the 15th comes.
    On December 4, leaflets signed by Mindszenty, who was hiding in the American Embassy, were found in the Fifth District, calling on believers to continue mourning until the private property system is restored.
    On the 4th and 5th, more than 300 people gathered in front of the British and American embassies. More than a dozen people in the crowd shouted slogans such as "Down with the Soviet Union" and "Down with the Kádár government." The others did not respond, but the gentlemen of the British embassy raised the British flag to salute the screaming thugs, and the American representatives in Hungary opened the windows and walked onto the sun deck to wave to the fascists.
    Another important new development in the construction work of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government in the past week is that the Party, youth, and worker organizations have begun to become active in various places. This is like the blood vessels of the human body, beginning to circulate.
    The districts of Budapest have continuously convened conferences of Party activists, and some enterprises have automatically restored Party groups. At these meetings, Party members unanimously expressed their support for the Kádár government, believing that the Party's current line is correct and willing to support it with action. Several representatives of the All-Hungarian Executive Committee of the Youth Student League (Edit Molnár, Gruber László, Mókó János) expressed their views and attitudes towards the political situation, saying that Hungary should take the socialist road, the Soviet army's actions on November 4 were necessary, otherwise it would be impossible to defend socialism; Hungary should remain in the socialist camp and strengthen Hungarian-Soviet friendship. They said that the Kádár government has gained the support of most of the youth and residents, and they are willing to support the government with their actions. Now 800 university students have volunteered to participate in the city's cleaning work. They added that it is a pity that the Party has not paid enough attention to conducting explanation work among the youth.
    The counter-revolutionaries are most afraid of the enthusiasm shown by the truly patriotic Hungarians. They have taken a series of destructive countermeasures in these days.
    First of all, the counter-revolutionaries committed some illegal acts in the workers' committees: one is to deceive workers who want to join the Party, telling them to wait until the Party Constitution is promulgated before discussing joining the Party. The other is to threaten activists with wage deductions and dismissals. A certain workers' committee passed a secret election to dismiss a factory director because he recently attended a meeting of Party activists. The third method is to restrict the activities of Party leaders. For example, the chairman of a factory workers' committee (who is a fascist) openly restricted the secretary of the district Party committee to only five minutes of speech to the workers in their factory.
    On the 5th, the workers' committee of the 11th District convened a meeting of reactionary elements and made a resolution to prepare for an armed riot on the 6th.
    In addition, the counter-revolutionary leaflets distributed in the past few days even more blatantly showed the madness of the enemy struggling in despair, such as slogans like this written on the leaflets: "Any behavior that helps the Kádár group is a crime and should be punishable by death!" "Give the Soviet army a bloody gift on St. Nicholas Day on December 6!"
    The fascists of the Hamburg factory sent a threatening leaflet to the temporary Party branch saying: "If you do not give up building the Party, you will face personal destruction!"
    On December 6, the Hungarian Free Trade Union organized a mass rally of 5,000 workers to answer the arrogance of the fascists. The workers held red flags and national flags, shouting slogans such as "We want peace," "We want tranquility," "We want to restore order," "Oppose the fascists," and "Support the worker-peasant regime," and sang the Marseillaise and the Internationale to show the international solidarity of the Hungarian working class in the struggle to stop the fascist restoration.

　　在巩固的过程中
　　本报记者　胡济邦
    应该肯定地说，匈牙利的情况是一天天向着健康的、正常的方面发展。我们也应当记得革命工农政权是在资本主义和法西斯复辟的风暴中产生，在国家一切机构都在瓦解或瘫痪之后重新建立起来的。这样就不难设想，在它成长和巩固的过程中必然要经过许多艰苦的斗争。到现在为止，反革命的残余势力还没有全部被肃清，他们寻找新政权的一切空隙，利用着各种形式进行疯狂的挣扎。
    对巩固新政权有决定意义的复工生产运动，最近在各企业中情况日见好转。　更重要的标志是最近一周来工人劳动情绪已显著上升。要求工作、放弃罢工已是一些忠于新政权职工的普遍情绪。城市居民的生活也日趋正常。工人们逐渐转向政府。这一切都使阶级敌人感到十分不安，因此最近几天来反革命分子又制造出一系列的挑衅和谣言，企图使局势继续复杂化。
    12月4日，在工农革命政府成立和苏军入城一个月的日子，敌人煽动妇女们在这一天到街上示威，企图通过妇女向苏军进行挑衅。4日约有二千五百妇女分批走过英雄广场向无名英雄墓献花，这些队伍主要是居住在市中心的知识妇女。
    大家知道，在过去的暴乱中，曾经有不少家庭受到伤亡、破坏和子女离散的痛苦。她们除了表达自己的悲痛心情之外，并没有做出如敌人所希望的行为。匈牙利的警察们对游行的妇女不仅没有阻挠，反而加以保护，使她们平安地回到了家里。而这一天伦敦的广播却制造出十万妇女示威被苏军坦克冲散并打死妇女一人的谣言。
    12月在欧洲是一个充满节日气氛的月份。反革命分子不愿给居民过和平幸福的日子，想继续把人民作为自己玩弄的工具，这几天又出现了各式各样的传单：
    在一个星期之前就预告居民说12月6日要举行武装暴动，嗾使居民大量采购粮食，先作准备，并将老少遣送到乡间去。反革命分子自己也明白，发动武装暴动已决不可能，因此在12月6日之前在5日又发出一种传单，诡称联合国最近要派全权代表来奥匈边境和他们建立联系，这会改变匈牙利的现状。应等待这一步骤，为此决定把6日的暴动日期改到12月15日。由于反革命分子的阴谋早被揭穿，我想在15日来到之前又该无限期地推迟下去。
    12月4日在第五区曾发现由躲藏在美国大使馆的明曾蒂署名的传单，呼吁信徒们在私有财产制未恢复之前应继续哀悼。
    4日和5日这两天有三百多人聚集在英国和美国大使馆的门前，人群中有十几人喊着打倒苏联，打倒卡达尔政府的口号，其他的人并没有响应，但是英国使馆的绅士们却扬出英国国旗向叫嚣的暴徒致敬，美国在匈牙利的代表们打开窗户，走出晒台向法西斯分子挥手招呼。
    最近一周来工农革命政权在建设工作中的又一重要新进展，是党的、青年的和工人的组织已在各地开始活跃起来。这就如同人的血脉一般，开始循环了。
    布达佩斯市的各区不断召开了党的积极分子大会，有些企业已把党的小组自动恢复起来。在这些会议上党员一致表示拥护卡达尔政府，认为党在当前的路线是正确的，愿以行动支持。青年学生联盟全匈执行委员会的几位代表（艾迪特·莫利娜，格鲁贝尔·拉土罗，莫科·亚诺什）表示了他们对政局的看法和态度，说匈牙利应走社会主义的道路，11月4日苏军的行动是必要的，否则无法保卫社会主义；匈牙利应留在社会主义阵营内并加强匈苏友好。他们说卡达尔政府已获得大部分青年和居民的支持，他们愿以自己的行动来支持政府，现在有八百名大学生自愿参加城市的清洁工作。他们又补充说，可惜党还没有足够注意到在青年中间进行解释工作。
    反革命分子最害怕匈牙利真正爱国者所表现的积极性。他们在这些天来采取了一系列破坏的对策。
    首先，反革命分子在工人委员会中作出了若干不法的行为：一种是欺骗想入党的工人，叫他们等党章颁布以后再谈入党的事情。另一种是用扣除工资和解除职务来威胁积极分子，某一工人委员会通过秘密选举把一厂长开除了，因为他最近参加了党的积极分子会议。第三种的方式是限制党的领导人的活动，如某工厂工人委员会的主席（他是一个法西斯分子）公然限制本区党委书记在他们工厂中只能对工人作五分钟的发言。
    5日这一天，第十一区的工人委员会召集了一次反动分子的会议，作出了准备在6日武装暴动的决议。
    此外，从这几天散发出来的反革命传单中，更露骨地表现了敌人在绝望中挣扎的疯狂性，如传单上写着这一类的口号：“一切帮助卡达尔集团的行为都是一种罪行，应处以死罪！”“12月6日的尼古拉希节给苏军以血腥的礼品！”
    汉布尔厂的法西斯分子给临时党支部的恐吓传单说：“你们如不放弃建党，将遭到人身的毁灭！”
    12月6日匈牙利自由工会组织了五千工人的游行的群众大会以回答法西斯的嚣张的气焰。工人们拿着红旗和国旗喊着要和平、要安宁、要恢复秩序，反对法西斯分子，拥护工农政权等口号，并高唱着马赛曲、国际歌表示匈牙利工人阶级在制止法西斯复辟的斗争中的国际团结。
