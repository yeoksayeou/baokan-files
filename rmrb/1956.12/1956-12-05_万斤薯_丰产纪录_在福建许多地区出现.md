　　"Ten Thousand Jin Sweet Potato" High-Yield Records
　　Appear in Many Areas of Fujian
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 3rd. This year, "ten thousand jin sweet potato" high-yield records have appeared in many areas of Fujian Province. In the Jinjiang and Fu'an Prefectures, the main sweet potato producing areas of Fujian Province, it is estimated that the yield per mu of more than 10,000 mu of sweet potato fields can reach about 10,000 jin. These "ten thousand jin sweet potatoes" are distributed on land with various natural conditions and soil properties, such as high mountains, plains, coasts, islands, and hills. "Ten thousand jin sweet potatoes" also appeared on the 27 mu of newly reclaimed mountain land in Putian County.
    One of the main reasons for the large number of "ten thousand jin sweet potatoes" appearing in various places is that this year, various places have conscientiously promoted Yu Dagan's high-yield experience and technical reform measures for cultivating "ten thousand jin sweet potatoes," such as improving soil, intensive cultivation and land preparation to create large ridges, and applying concentrated fertilizer in stages and layers. This year, about 500,000 mu of sweet potato fields in the four prefectures of Jinjiang, Fu'an, Longxi, and Nanping have been cultivated by adapting Yu Dagan's experience to local conditions. The yield of these sweet potato fields is generally doubled or two to three times higher than in previous years, and the yield per mu of many fields has reached 10,000 jin.
    This year, Fujian Province has achieved great success in promoting Yu Dagan's high-yield experience, but in a few areas, the phenomenon of mechanically copying the experience has occurred, resulting in reduced yields, and even "ten thousand jin sweet potatoes" becoming "ten thousand roots of whiskers."

### “万斤薯”丰产纪录　在福建许多地区出现

　　“万斤薯”丰产纪录
　　在福建许多地区出现
    新华社福州3日电　福建省今年有许多地区出现了“万斤薯”的丰产纪录。福建省主要甘薯产地——晋江和福安两专区的一万多亩甘薯田，预计每亩产量都可以达到一万斤左右。这些“万斤薯”分布在高山、平原、沿海、海岛、丘陵等各种自然条件、土壤性质不同的土地上。在莆田县的二十七亩新开荒的山地上也出现了“万斤薯”。
    各地大量出现“万斤薯”的主要原因之一，是今年各地认真地推广了余大干改良土壤、精耕整地作大畦、分期分层集中施肥等培育“万斤薯”的丰产经验和技术改革措施。晋江、福安、龙溪、南平四个专区，今年约有五十多万亩甘薯田是因地制宜地运用余大干的经验来培育的。这些甘薯田一般都比往年产量提高一倍或二、三倍，有不少田每亩产量达到一万斤。
    福建各地今年在推广余大干丰产经验时是取得很大成效的，但在少数地区发生硬搬硬套现象，结果造成减收，甚至“万斤薯”成了“万根须”。
