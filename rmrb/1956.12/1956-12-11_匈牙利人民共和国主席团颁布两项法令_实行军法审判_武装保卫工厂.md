    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 10th: TASS, Budapest, December 10th: The Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic last night promulgated a decree on the implementation of martial law throughout the country and a decree establishing regulations for the armed defense of factories.

    The decree on the implementation of martial law states that counter-revolutionary elements and other hostile elements still possess many weapons and ammunition, which they use to achieve hostile purposes, threatening the lives, peaceful labor, and safety of residents. In view of the above situation, the working people are rightly demanding that urgent measures be taken. Therefore, the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic has decided to implement martial law measures starting at 6:00 PM on December 11th. Anyone who commits murder, arson, robbery, sabotage of enterprise equipment, or illegally possesses weapons will be subject to martial law trial.

    The decree states that people illegally possessing weapons should surrender their weapons before 6:00 PM on December 11th. Those who voluntarily surrender their weapons will not be prosecuted. Anyone who knows that someone is hiding weapons but does not report it to the authorities before December 11th will also be subject to martial law trial.

    The Presidium's second decree formulates regulations for workers to defend factories.

    This decree states that in some places, counter-revolutionary elements who disrupt order and incite workers to go on strike have infiltrated armed defense teams. The Presidium of the Republic has resolved that the leaders and members of armed defense teams in enterprises and institutions are responsible for declaring all their weapons to the civil police organs and obtaining permits to possess weapons before December 12th. During the period from submitting the application to obtaining the relevant permit, the weapons may still be kept by the individual. Anyone who fails to declare possession of weapons or continues to illegally possess weapons after failing to obtain a permit to possess weapons will be subject to martial law trial.

    匈牙利人民共和国主席团颁布两项法令
    实行军法审判　武装保卫工厂
    据新华社10日讯　塔斯社布达佩斯10日讯：匈牙利人民共和国主席团昨晚颁布关于在全国实行军法审判的法令和确定武装保卫工厂条例的法令。
    关于实施军法审判的法令说，反革命分子和其他敌对分子还掌握有许多武器和弹药，他们用这些东西来达到敌意的目的，威胁居民生命、和平劳动和安全，鉴于上述情况，劳动人民正当地要求采取紧急措施。因此，匈牙利人民共和国主席团决定从12月11日下午六时开始实行军法审判办法。凡杀人、纵火、抢劫、破坏企业设备以及私藏武器者均将受军法审判。
    法令说，私藏武器的人应当在12月11日下午六时以前将武器交出。自动交出武器的人将不予追究。凡知道有人藏有武器而在12月11日以前没有报告当局的，也将提交军法审判。
    主席团的第二个法令拟定了工人保卫工厂的条例。
    这个法令说，在某些地方，破坏秩序和煽动工人怠工等的反革命分子混入武装保卫队。共和国主席团作出决议，各企业和机关的武装保卫队的领导人和成员有责任在12月12日以前向民警机关申报他们所有的武器并取得保有武器的许可证。在提出申请到获得有关许可证这一段时期内，武器仍可由本人保管。不申报持有武器或在得不到持有武器的许可后仍继续私藏武器的人，将提交军法审判。
