　　British Political Situation
　　By our London Correspondent, Pan Fei

　　At 10:30 PM on the 6th, in a vote in the British House of Commons on a motion of confidence in the government proposed by the Conservative Party, fifteen Conservative MPs abstained.

　　If Macmillan's report to Parliament a few days ago on the British economic situation announced that Britain was in an economic crisis, then the vote on the evening of the 6th shows that the British government is now facing its political crisis as well. The "Manchester Guardian" pointed out: since the Chamberlain government, no Conservative government has been more unstable than this one.

　　In recent days, the political temperature in the British Parliament has been below freezing. The small "excitement" in London caused by the US "support" of Britain with oil has now dissipated. Macmillan's report took MPs by surprise; they did not expect the economic situation to have deteriorated to such an extent. Britain's gold and dollar reserves have fallen to approximately £700 million. This is the lowest figure since 1950, even lower than the most critical post-war year of 1952. The rate of decline is staggering: from January to October of this year, Britain's gold and dollar reserves were depleted by £57 million; but in the single month of November, the loss reached approximately £100 million. The day after Macmillan's report was released, the British market reacted immediately: domestic road transport costs rose by 7.5%; Dunlop tires rose by 10%; and price increases for food and other items will follow.

　　After Macmillan's report was published, feelings of unease and dissatisfaction mingled together and spread throughout the House of Commons. The question of Eden's departure and government reshuffle has become the subject of private discussions among Conservative MPs. Even the "Times," known for its "caution," has carefully revealed information about this in recent days. When the news that Eden's "condition" had suddenly "improved" reached London, the "Times" wrote on the 6th:

　　"No one in Parliament cares about the Prime Minister's condition." MPs generally believe that "the government should make significant reshuffles... This sentiment is not only occurring among the far right of the Conservative Party."

　　It is believed here that it is already certain that the Conservative Party will make Eden a scapegoat and drive him out of office. The question now seems to be only when and how Eden will step down, who will replace him, and how many people will go with Eden. It is said that the Conservative Party has not yet agreed on who will succeed Eden. Butler, as the leader of the "moderate" (or "steady") faction on the Suez issue, certainly has certain qualifications, but it is rumored that he is opposed by some within the Conservative Party. In addition, there are rumors in London that the government will make a "larger-scale" "reshuffle," and replace several ministers who have a "greater connection" with the war of aggression. In this way, the Conservative Party can claim that this "new" government has "no connection" with the sinful policies on the Suez Canal issue, and hope to further obtain the "cooperation" of the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party.

　　The political and economic crisis that erupted in Britain over the Suez Canal issue once again demonstrates the emptiness and weakness of this ancient colonial empire. The "Financial Times" editorial most accurately described this situation, saying: "Fifty years ago, no one in the world dared to challenge Britain. Our efforts to decorate the facade have now gone bankrupt. Like a traditional old family, first the land is pawned, then the family members scatter like birds and beasts, and finally the house collapses. Britain is now standing between the second and third stages."

　　A comic scene in this tragedy is that at this very moment, some British political leaders are particularly happy to talk about "Anglo-American unity." After the United States announced its decision to ship oil to Britain, they declared that Anglo-American relations had "improved" and that the Western camp was "united." However, the fact is that Britain's hegemony in the Middle East has collapsed, and the Middle Eastern countries of the Baghdad Pact have been placed under the protection of the Stars and Stripes; Britain's industry has largely become dependent on American oil. Perhaps the fiercest struggle between the two Western powers has already begun....

　　英国政局
　　本报驻伦敦记者　潘非
    6日晚10点半英国下院在表决保守党提出的对政府的信任案时，有十五名保守党议员弃权。
    如果说：麦克米伦前两天在议会所作的有关英国经济情况的报告，宣告英国已处在经济危机之中；那末，6日晚上的投票结果说明，英国政府紧接着又面临了它的政治危机。“曼彻斯特卫报”指出：自从张伯伦政府以来，再没有比这一届的保守党政府更不稳定的了。
    连日以来，英国议会中的政治气温，一直在冰点以下。由于美国以石油“支援”英国而在伦敦所引起的小小的“兴奋”，现在已被吹得烟消云散。麦克米伦的报告，曾使议员们大吃一惊；他们意料不到经济情况的恶化，已到了如此地步。英国黄金美元的储备，已跌落到约七亿英镑。这是自从1950年以来的最低数字，甚至低于战后最危急的1952年。下降的幅度是这样惊人：从今年的1月到10月，英国的黄金美元储备消耗了五千七百万英镑；而在11月的一个月中，损耗却达约一亿英镑之巨。在麦克米伦报告的第二天，英国市场立即发生了敏感的反映：国内的公路运输费用上涨7.5％；邓禄普轮胎上涨10％；食品和其他物品的涨价，将随之而来。
    麦克米伦的报告发表后，不安和不满的情绪交融在一起，在下院中到处蔓延。有关艾登去留和政府改组的问题，已成为保守党议员私下谈论的主题。甚至连以“谨慎”出名的“泰晤士报”连日也小心地透露出这一方面的消息。当艾登的“病况”突然“转佳”的电讯到达伦敦以后，6日的“泰晤士报”写道：
  “议会中无人重视首相的病况”。议员们咸信“政府应该作巨大的改组……这种情绪不仅发生在保守党的极右派中间”。
    此间有人认为，把艾登作为替罪羊而驱之下台，这在保守党说来已经是肯定的了。现在的问题，似乎只在于艾登在什么时候和用什么方式下台，什么人来代替他，以及随同艾登而去的将有多少人。据说，保守党中对于谁来接替艾登，意见尚未一致。巴特勒作为在苏伊士问题上“温和派”（或称“稳健派”）的领袖，当然具有一定的条件，但传说遭到保守党内一部分人的反对。另外，伦敦还谣传政府将作“较大规模”的“改组”，把几个同侵略战争有“较大关系”的部长加以撤换。这样一来，保守党便可以宣称：这个“新的”政府和苏伊士运河问题上的罪恶政策“没有干系”，并希望进而取得工党右派领袖的“合作”。
    英国在苏伊士运河问题上所爆发的政治、经济危机，再一次说明这个古老的殖民帝国的空虚孱弱。“金融时报”的社论最确切不过地描绘了这种情况，它说：“五十年以前，在全世界哪有人敢于向英国挑战。使我们装饰门面的努力，现在已经破产了。像一个传统的古老家庭一样，首先是典当土地，其次是家人作鸟兽散，最后是房屋倒塌。现在的英国，正站在第二和第三阶段之间。”
    在这个悲剧中的一幕喜剧，是正当这个时候，英国的一些政治领袖特别高兴谈“英美团结”。在美国将运送石油给予英国的决定宣布以后，他们宣称英美关系“好转”了，西方阵营“一致”了。然而，事实是英国在中东的霸权已经崩溃，巴格达集团的中东国家已被置于星条旗的庇护之下；英国的工业，已在很大程度上依赖于美国的石油。也许，两个西方大国间的最尖锐的斗争，已经开始了……。
