　　The area outside Jiuquan city contains a park with a spring lake. The tall willows and clear lake create a particularly beautiful scene. The small pond under the shade of that pavilion has its own touching origin. It is said that long ago, a valiant general repelled invading enemies on the frontier. To reward his merit, the Emperor sent him a bottle of imperial wine from afar. The general thanked the Emperor for his grace but did not selfishly enjoy the precious reward alone. He knew that the victory was not due to his personal bravery; without his brothers, he could not have succeeded in anything. However, there was a problem that troubled him: how could he allow all his brothers to taste just one bottle of wine? With a flash of inspiration, he poured the wine into that clear spring. In this way, all the brothers tasted its fragrance. This legend originated in ancient times, and to this day, it has seen countless years; yet, for us, it is still so fresh, as if time can only increase its radiance!

　　酒泉的传说
　　锺敬文酒泉城外有个泉湖公园，高柳明湖，风景好幽丽；那个凉亭遮荫下的小池，更有它动人的一段来历。据说，从前有位英勇的将军，在边境上打退了来犯的敌人，皇帝为了酬报他的功劳，远远地送来御酒一瓶。将军拜谢了皇帝的恩赐，却没有把珍贵的奖品私自享用，他知道战胜不是由于个人的豪勇，没有弟兄们，他什么也不会成功。可是，事情有点使他为难，一瓶酒，怎样叫全体弟兄都尝遍？灵机一动，他把酒倒进那口清泉里，这样，众弟兄都尝到了它的芬芳。这个传说产生自远古的年代，到今天，不知道经历了多少星霜；可是，对于我们，它还是这样新鲜，时间好像只能增益它的光焰！
