Educating Grassroots Cadres to Trust the Wisdom of the Masses
Jian Hong

    The principle of running cooperatives democratically is generally known by cadres of agricultural cooperatives. Why is it that it cannot be well implemented in some agricultural cooperatives? Judging from the situation in the Yidu Xuguang Agricultural Cooperative and the Shouzhang Zhouna Township Agricultural Cooperative in Shandong, one of the important reasons is that the cooperative cadres do not believe in the wisdom and ability of the cooperative members.

    In August of this year, several branch committee members from Zhouna Township, Shouzhang County, participated in a three-level cadre meeting held by the county party committee. At this meeting, the county party committee organized some typical speeches to inspire cadres to learn the leadership method of "discussing matters with the masses." Although these branch committee members felt that the mass line was correct in principle, they did not seriously accept it ideologically. Some people thought: "Democracy" is an old clich√©, easy to talk about, but difficult to implement in practice. Some said: "Too many people, too many opinions, everyone being in charge will accomplish nothing." Others said: "It would be good if we could really rely on everyone to run the cooperative, but in reality, we still have to be in charge."

    After returning to the township, they raised the issue of relying on cooperative members to revise the production quota at the branch committee meeting. As soon as this opinion was raised, it was opposed by most of the branch committee members. Some said, "Cadres receive constant education and still can't do it well! It will be even worse if it is handed over to the masses!" Others said, "Cooperative members are all selfish; if you ask them to discuss, wouldn't they just bite each other?" They said many things that showed they did not believe in the masses.

    Branch Secretary Yang Jinming used his own experience to criticize these erroneous ideas. He used the fact that the wheat season production quota was divorced from reality and caused dissatisfaction among the masses to illustrate the disadvantages of relying solely on a few cadres to do everything and not following the mass line. These concrete facts made them begin to realize the strength of the cooperative members, but this belief was still not solid.

    After reaching a consensus at the branch committee meeting, the cooperative also convened a special meeting to formulate a work-point and production quota plan, allowing everyone to specifically study the production quota. The discussion at this meeting was very lively. Some advocated setting the quota lower, saying that the high quota in the wheat season caused a lot of trouble, so it would be better to set it lower. Others advocated setting the quota higher, believing that a lower quota would affect the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. These two opinions seemed to make sense, and they argued endlessly. Some branch committee members, seeing this situation, wavered in their belief in relying on the masses, thinking to themselves: too many people, too many opinions, nothing can be accomplished. Branch Secretary Yang Jinming did not think so. From the debate between the two opinions, he gained a deeper understanding of the dangers of both high and low quotas, thereby forcefully criticizing these two deviations. After preliminary discussion, the cadres realized that in order to set a production quota that was in line with reality, it was necessary to mobilize the masses to have a democratic discussion. The effect of doing so was indeed very good. Many cooperative members put forward correct indicators and valuable opinions based on their own practical experience. Even Yang Yuzhu, a cooperative member who usually kept quiet, put forward very good opinions. Based on everyone's experience, the yield target for millet per mu (0.067 hectares) on general land was increased from 350 jin (175 kg) to 390 jin (195 kg), beans from 160 jin (80 kg) to 180 jin (90 kg), and early corn was reduced by 10 jin (5 kg). The autumn harvest results proved that the actual yield was close to the target revised by the cooperative members, which was more accurate than the target initially proposed by the cadres. After this incident, many cooperative cadres further understood the benefits of following the mass line.

    The leadership situation in the Yidu County Xuguang Agricultural Cooperative also shows that to truly implement the principle of democratic cooperative management, the primary task is for grassroots cadres to establish a mass perspective; and this mass perspective and the style of following the mass line cannot be established overnight. Several main cadres in this township (branch secretary, township head, cooperative director, and deputy director) were all activists who grew up in the land reform struggle. They had been working for a long time, had good backgrounds, and were highly conscious. For example, Deputy Cooperative Director Zhang Xingye was a poor peasant before the land reform and lived a very hard life; after the land reform, because his family had many members and he had been working as a cadre and was very busy, he had no time to participate in labor, so his family's life was still difficult. However, he rarely mentioned his family's difficulties. He was very concerned about the difficulties of the masses and could help solve them in a timely manner. Therefore, he had a relatively high prestige among the masses, and the cooperative members all considered him a selfless and good cadre and trusted him very much. The cooperative director, branch secretary, and township head, although not as prestigious as Zhang Xingye, were also upright and had a certain mass perspective. Even these cadres with mass work experience still had some problems in implementing the principle of democratic cooperative management.

    When estimating production before the summer harvest, some cadres adopted an attitude of "rather high than low," estimating 560 jin per large mu (0.2 hectares). They themselves knew it was high, but they were afraid of causing trouble, so they did not dare to let everyone discuss it. Only a few cadres subjectively made a preliminary wheat distribution plan, which was announced to everyone and that was it. None of the cooperative members believed that they could be distributed so much, and everyone raised many opinions, but they ignored them. After the wheat harvest, the actual yield was very different from the estimated yield, and the cooperative members were very dissatisfied. Some said: "The management committee is just boasting and deceiving people." Seeing that the situation was serious, the cadres promptly made a self-criticism to the masses and distributed the money from selling the wheat in a timely manner, and it was only with great difficulty that the emotions of the cooperative members were stabilized.

    When estimating production for the autumn harvest, the cadres learned from the lessons of the summer harvest and dared not do everything themselves, so they convened a meeting of cooperative member representatives to allow the cooperative members to discuss repeatedly. As a result of the discussion, the estimated production was close to the actual production, and a lot of trouble was saved during the distribution. After experiencing these things, they had a relatively deep understanding of the importance of relying on the masses. However, this understanding did not mean that they could handle everything according to the principles of democracy, and when they encountered some obstacles, they returned to the old ways. When distributing the autumn harvest, some teams showed localism, and some cadres wanted to carry out the distribution in a pack-handle manner again.

    From these situations, we can see that these cooperative cadres believed in the masses on some issues, but on other issues, they showed that they could not believe in the masses; in some work, they could better follow the mass line, while in other work, they took over everything and ordered the masses. This shows that implementing the principle of democratic cooperative management and following the mass line is a complex process of ideological and work style transformation, not something that can be achieved simply by "rectifying" or talking about principles.

    From the above situations, we can also see that to enable the broad masses of grassroots cadres to correctly implement the principle of democratic cooperative management, the first requirement is to have a correct mass perspective, to believe in the strength and wisdom of the masses. Without this basic condition, there is no way to talk about following the mass line and promoting democracy.

    Establishing a correct mass perspective is indeed not an easy task. These grassroots cadres are not only deeply influenced by the private ownership system and the small-peasant economy, but also more or less influenced by feudal remnants. They often cannot see the strength of the masses, and even regard the masses' debates on a certain issue as idle chatter. Although many facts are constantly teaching them, many cadres, blinded by the various influences of the old society, often cannot consciously accept these lessons. The leadership should help them summarize their work so that they can continuously gain experience and lessons from practical work and recognize the strength of the masses. Mutual inspiration among grassroots cadres is also needed. For example, the branch committee members of Zhouna Township did not truly recognize the strength of the masses after being educated by the county party committee; only after being inspired by the branch secretary did they have a further understanding.

    Appropriate criticism should be given to those erroneous views that ignore the strength of the masses. The saying "too many people, too many opinions, nothing can be accomplished" has been passed down from the old society. This saying is very beneficial to feudal rulers, but harmful to socialist cooperatives. What these cadres call "too many people, too many opinions" actually has only two meanings: one is various opinions that are beneficial to the collective cause; the other is various opinions that are in contradiction with the collective interest. It is unavoidable to have different opinions, and there is nothing to be afraid of. With regard to different opinions, it is absolutely impossible to feel aversion without thinking; it is necessary to calmly consider whether they are beneficial to the collective cause. If it is beneficial to the collective, even if it is somewhat contradictory to one's own opinion, it must be listened to very well. Those opinions that contradict the collective interest should also be listened to carefully; it is better to have these opinions raised than to keep them in people's hearts; only by letting them raise them can they be persuaded and improved. For example, the branch secretary of Zhouna Township took the initiative to criticize these two deviations and put forward the correct method when the two biased opinions were debated endlessly. In this way, the wrong opinions were corrected, and the correct opinions were naturally recognized and accepted by everyone; although both sides' opinions were one-sided, wouldn't they be comprehensive when combined?
