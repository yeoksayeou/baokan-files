Educating Grassroots Cadres to Trust the Wisdom of the Masses
Jian Hong

    The principle of running cooperatives democratically is generally known by cadres of agricultural cooperatives. Why is it that it cannot be well implemented in some agricultural cooperatives? Judging from the situation in the Yidu Xuguang Agricultural Cooperative and the Shouzhang Zhouna Township Agricultural Cooperative in Shandong, one of the important reasons is that the cooperative cadres do not believe in the wisdom and ability of the cooperative members.

    In August of this year, several branch committee members from Zhouna Township, Shouzhang County, participated in a three-level cadre meeting held by the county party committee. At this meeting, the county party committee organized some typical speeches to inspire cadres to learn the leadership method of "discussing matters with the masses." Although these branch committee members felt that the mass line was correct in principle, they did not seriously accept it ideologically. Some people thought: "Democracy" is an old cliché, easy to talk about, but difficult to implement in practice. Some said: "Too many people, too many opinions, everyone being in charge will accomplish nothing." Others said: "It would be good if we could really rely on everyone to run the cooperative, but in reality, we still have to be in charge."

    After returning to the township, they raised the issue of relying on cooperative members to revise the production quota at the branch committee meeting. As soon as this opinion was raised, it was opposed by most of the branch committee members. Some said, "Cadres receive constant education and still can't do it well! It will be even worse if it is handed over to the masses!" Others said, "Cooperative members are all selfish; if you ask them to discuss, wouldn't they just bite each other?" They said many things that showed they did not believe in the masses.

    Branch Secretary Yang Jinming used his own experience to criticize these erroneous ideas. He used the fact that the wheat season production quota was divorced from reality and caused dissatisfaction among the masses to illustrate the disadvantages of relying solely on a few cadres to do everything and not following the mass line. These concrete facts made them begin to realize the strength of the cooperative members, but this belief was still not solid.

    After reaching a consensus at the branch committee meeting, the cooperative also convened a special meeting to formulate a work-point and production quota plan, allowing everyone to specifically study the production quota. The discussion at this meeting was very lively. Some advocated setting the quota lower, saying that the high quota in the wheat season caused a lot of trouble, so it would be better to set it lower. Others advocated setting the quota higher, believing that a lower quota would affect the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. These two opinions seemed to make sense, and they argued endlessly. Some branch committee members, seeing this situation, wavered in their belief in relying on the masses, thinking to themselves: too many people, too many opinions, nothing can be accomplished. Branch Secretary Yang Jinming did not think so. From the debate between the two opinions, he gained a deeper understanding of the dangers of both high and low quotas, thereby forcefully criticizing these two deviations. After preliminary discussion, the cadres realized that in order to set a production quota that was in line with reality, it was necessary to mobilize the masses to have a democratic discussion. The effect of doing so was indeed very good. Many cooperative members put forward correct indicators and valuable opinions based on their own practical experience. Even Yang Yuzhu, a cooperative member who usually kept quiet, put forward very good opinions. Based on everyone's experience, the yield target for millet per mu (0.067 hectares) on general land was increased from 350 jin (175 kg) to 390 jin (195 kg), beans from 160 jin (80 kg) to 180 jin (90 kg), and early corn was reduced by 10 jin (5 kg). The autumn harvest results proved that the actual yield was close to the target revised by the cooperative members, which was more accurate than the target initially proposed by the cadres. After this incident, many cooperative cadres further understood the benefits of following the mass line.

    The leadership situation in the Yidu County Xuguang Agricultural Cooperative also shows that to truly implement the principle of democratic cooperative management, the primary task is for grassroots cadres to establish a mass perspective; and this mass perspective and the style of following the mass line cannot be established overnight. Several main cadres in this township (branch secretary, township head, cooperative director, and deputy director) were all activists who grew up in the land reform struggle. They had been working for a long time, had good backgrounds, and were highly conscious. For example, Deputy Cooperative Director Zhang Xingye was a poor peasant before the land reform and lived a very hard life; after the land reform, because his family had many members and he had been working as a cadre and was very busy, he had no time to participate in labor, so his family's life was still difficult. However, he rarely mentioned his family's difficulties. He was very concerned about the difficulties of the masses and could help solve them in a timely manner. Therefore, he had a relatively high prestige among the masses, and the cooperative members all considered him a selfless and good cadre and trusted him very much. The cooperative director, branch secretary, and township head, although not as prestigious as Zhang Xingye, were also upright and had a certain mass perspective. Even these cadres with mass work experience still had some problems in implementing the principle of democratic cooperative management.

    When estimating production before the summer harvest, some cadres adopted an attitude of "rather high than low," estimating 560 jin per large mu (0.2 hectares). They themselves knew it was high, but they were afraid of causing trouble, so they did not dare to let everyone discuss it. Only a few cadres subjectively made a preliminary wheat distribution plan, which was announced to everyone and that was it. None of the cooperative members believed that they could be distributed so much, and everyone raised many opinions, but they ignored them. After the wheat harvest, the actual yield was very different from the estimated yield, and the cooperative members were very dissatisfied. Some said: "The management committee is just boasting and deceiving people." Seeing that the situation was serious, the cadres promptly made a self-criticism to the masses and distributed the money from selling the wheat in a timely manner, and it was only with great difficulty that the emotions of the cooperative members were stabilized.

    When estimating production for the autumn harvest, the cadres learned from the lessons of the summer harvest and dared not do everything themselves, so they convened a meeting of cooperative member representatives to allow the cooperative members to discuss repeatedly. As a result of the discussion, the estimated production was close to the actual production, and a lot of trouble was saved during the distribution. After experiencing these things, they had a relatively deep understanding of the importance of relying on the masses. However, this understanding did not mean that they could handle everything according to the principles of democracy, and when they encountered some obstacles, they returned to the old ways. When distributing the autumn harvest, some teams showed localism, and some cadres wanted to carry out the distribution in a pack-handle manner again.

    From these situations, we can see that these cooperative cadres believed in the masses on some issues, but on other issues, they showed that they could not believe in the masses; in some work, they could better follow the mass line, while in other work, they took over everything and ordered the masses. This shows that implementing the principle of democratic cooperative management and following the mass line is a complex process of ideological and work style transformation, not something that can be achieved simply by "rectifying" or talking about principles.

    From the above situations, we can also see that to enable the broad masses of grassroots cadres to correctly implement the principle of democratic cooperative management, the first requirement is to have a correct mass perspective, to believe in the strength and wisdom of the masses. Without this basic condition, there is no way to talk about following the mass line and promoting democracy.

    Establishing a correct mass perspective is indeed not an easy task. These grassroots cadres are not only deeply influenced by the private ownership system and the small-peasant economy, but also more or less influenced by feudal remnants. They often cannot see the strength of the masses, and even regard the masses' debates on a certain issue as idle chatter. Although many facts are constantly teaching them, many cadres, blinded by the various influences of the old society, often cannot consciously accept these lessons. The leadership should help them summarize their work so that they can continuously gain experience and lessons from practical work and recognize the strength of the masses. Mutual inspiration among grassroots cadres is also needed. For example, the branch committee members of Zhouna Township did not truly recognize the strength of the masses after being educated by the county party committee; only after being inspired by the branch secretary did they have a further understanding.

    Appropriate criticism should be given to those erroneous views that ignore the strength of the masses. The saying "too many people, too many opinions, nothing can be accomplished" has been passed down from the old society. This saying is very beneficial to feudal rulers, but harmful to socialist cooperatives. What these cadres call "too many people, too many opinions" actually has only two meanings: one is various opinions that are beneficial to the collective cause; the other is various opinions that are in contradiction with the collective interest. It is unavoidable to have different opinions, and there is nothing to be afraid of. With regard to different opinions, it is absolutely impossible to feel aversion without thinking; it is necessary to calmly consider whether they are beneficial to the collective cause. If it is beneficial to the collective, even if it is somewhat contradictory to one's own opinion, it must be listened to very well. Those opinions that contradict the collective interest should also be listened to carefully; it is better to have these opinions raised than to keep them in people's hearts; only by letting them raise them can they be persuaded and improved. For example, the branch secretary of Zhouna Township took the initiative to criticize these two deviations and put forward the correct method when the two biased opinions were debated endlessly. In this way, the wrong opinions were corrected, and the correct opinions were naturally recognized and accepted by everyone; although both sides' opinions were one-sided, wouldn't they be comprehensive when combined?

    教育基层干部相信群众的智慧
    剑虹
    民主办社的方针，农业社的干部一般都知道，为什么在部分农业合作社里却不能很好地贯彻执行呢？从山东益都旭光农业社和寿张周那乡农业社的情况来看，社干部不相信社员群众的智慧和能力是重要原因之一。
    寿张县周那乡的几个支部委员，今年8月间，参加了县委召开的三级干部会议。在这个会议上，县委组织了一些典型发言，启发干部学习“有事和群众商量”的领导方法。这些支部委员虽然从道理上觉得走群众路线很对，但是并没有从思想上认真接受。有人认为：“民主”是老一套，说话容易，实际作起来难。有的说：“人多嘴杂，大家当家一事无成。”有的说：“真能靠大家办社也好，实际上还得咱当家。”
    他们回乡以后，在支委会上提出了依靠社员修订包产指标的问题。这意见一提出来，便遭到了多数支部委员的反对。有的说：“干部常受教育，还弄不好哩！交给群众更不成！”有的说：“社员都自私，叫他们讨论还不是互相乱咬一气吗？”你一言他一语，说了许多不相信群众的话。
    支部书记杨金明用本身的体会，对这些错误思想进行了批判。他以麦季包产脱离实际、引起群众不满的事实，说明只靠少数干部包办不走群众路线的坏处。这些具体事实使他们开始认识到社员群众的力量，但这种信念还很不巩固。
    支委会上认识一致以后，社里又召开了专门制定包工包产方案的会议，让大家具体研究包产指标。在这个会上讨论得很热烈，有的主张包低一点，说麦季包高出了很多麻烦，还是包低点好办事。有的主张包高点，认为低了会影响社员的生产情绪。这两种意见好像都满有道理，你一言他一语争论不休。有些支部委员看到这种情况，依靠群众的信念又动摇了，心里暗暗地想：人多嘴杂就是办不成事。支部书记杨金明却不是这样想。他从两种意见的争论中，更深刻地认识了包高和包低的危害，从而有力地批判了这两种偏向。经过初步讨论，干部们认识到要把包产指标定得切合实际，一定要发动群众民主讨论。这样作的效果果然很好，许多社员根据自己的实际经验提出了正确的指标和宝贵的意见。连平时不吭气的社员杨玉珠，也提出了很好的意见。根据大家的经验，将一般土地每亩谷子的产量指标从三百五十斤提高到三百九十斤，豆子从一百六十斤提高到一百八十斤，早玉米下降了十斤。秋收结果证明：实产量和社员群众修改后的指标差不多，比干部们开始提出的指标要正确。经过了这件事，不少社干部进一步懂得了走群众路线的好处。
    益都县旭光农业社的领导情况，也同样说明了：要真正实现民主办社方针，首先在于基层干部树立群众观点；而这种群众观点和群众路线的作风又不是一下能够树立起来的。这个乡的几个主要干部（支部书记、乡长、社主任、副主任）都是在土地改革斗争中生长起来的积极分子。他们工作时间长，成分好，觉悟也高。如副社长张兴业土地改革以前是贫农，生活很苦；土地改革以后，因为家里人口多，自己又一直当干部，工作很忙，无暇参加劳动，所以家中的生活仍然很困难。但他很少提自己家里的困难。他对群众的困难却很关心，并能及时帮助解决。因此，他在群众中有相当高的威信，社员们都认为他是个大公无私的好干部，都很信任他。社主任、支部书记和乡长，虽然没有张兴业的威信高，但也是作风正派，具有一定的群众观点的好干部。就是这样一些有着群众工作经验的干部，在贯彻执行民主办社的方针上，仍然有一些问题。
    夏收前估产的时候，部分干部抱着“宁高勿低”的态度，每一大亩（三市亩）估产五百六十斤。他们自己明知道高了，怕引起麻烦，也不敢让大家讨论。只是少数干部主观地做出了小麦预分方案，向大家一公布就算完事。社员们谁也不相信能分那么多，大家提了许多意见，他们也没有理会。收麦以后，实产数和估产数相差很多，社员非常不满。有的说：“管委会尽吹，尽骗人。”干部们看到情况严重，一方面及时向群众做了检讨，一方面将卖小麦的钱及时进行了分配，好容易才使社员的情绪安定下来。
    秋收估产的时候，干部们接受了夏收估产的教训，不敢再包办代替，就召集社员代表大会让社员群众反复讨论。讨论结果，估产接近实际，分配的时候省了很多麻烦。经历了这些事情以后，他们比较深刻地认识了依靠群众的重要。但是，这样认识了并不等于就能处处按照民主的原则来办事，遇到一些阻碍就又返回到老路上去了。秋收分配的时候，有些队表现本位主义，有些干部就又想用包办的方法来进行分配。
    从这些情况中可以看到：这些社干部在某些问题上相信群众，在某些问题上又表现不能相信群众；在有些工作中能较好地走群众路线，在有些工作中又包办代替、命令群众。这说明贯彻民主办社方针、走群众路线是一个复杂的思想作风改造的过程，不是简单“整一整”或讲讲原则就能奏效的。
    从上述情况中也可以看到，要使广大的基层干部正确地贯彻执行民主办社的方针，首先要有正确的群众观点，要相信群众的力量和智慧。没有这个基本条件，就谈不到走群众路线和发扬民主。
    要树立正确的群众观点，确实不是一件容易的事。这些基层干部不仅受私有制度和小农经济的影响很深，还或多或少地受了封建残余的影响。他们往往看不到群众的力量，甚至把群众对某一问题的争论看成了瞎扯皮。许多事实虽然不断地在教训着他们，但是不少干部因受旧社会种种影响的蒙蔽，常常不能自觉地接受这些教训。领导方面应该帮助他们总结工作，使他们不断地从实际工作中取得经验教训，认识群众的力量。也需要基层干部之间互相启发。如周那乡的支委们，经过县委的教育，并没有真正认识到群众的力量；经支部书记启发后，才有了进一步的认识。
    对于那些忽视群众力量的错误看法，应该给予恰当的批判。“人多嘴杂办不成事”的话，是从旧社会流传下来的。这说法对封建统治者来说是很有利的，对社会主义性质的合作社来说，就是有害的。这些干部所谓的“人多嘴杂”，其实，不外两种意思：一种是有利于集体事业的各种意见；一种是同集体利益相矛盾的各种意见。有不同的意见，这是难免的，也没有什么可怕。对于不同的意见，决不可不加思索先起反感，应该冷静地考虑它们对集体事业是否有益。如果对集体有益，只是和自己的意见有些抵触，也必须很好地倾听。对那种和集体利益相矛盾的意见，也是应该好好听听的；这些意见提出来比闷在人们心里要好些，只有让他们提出来，才可能说服他们、提高他们。如周那乡的支部书记，在两种有偏向的意见争论不休的时候，就主动地批判了这两种偏向，提出了正确的办法。这样，错误的意见被纠正了，正确的意见自然就被大家认识和接受了；两方面的意见虽然都是片面的，合起来不就全面了吗？
