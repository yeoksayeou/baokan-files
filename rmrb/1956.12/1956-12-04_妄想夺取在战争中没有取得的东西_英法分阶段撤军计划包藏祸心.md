　　Dreaming of Seizing What Was Not Obtained in War
　　Anglo-French Phased Withdrawal Plan Harbors Sinister Intentions
Xinhua News Agency, London, December 3rd (Reporter Peng Di) – This correspondent reports: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd will announce the government's decision on the withdrawal of the attacking forces from Egypt in the House of Commons on December 3rd. Although not yet officially confirmed, the general impression here is that Britain and France have decided to "withdraw in phases" their attacking forces, with conditions attached.

It is said that this long-overdue decision was made on November 30 when French Foreign Minister Pineau flew here to meet with British government leaders. This is because the two governments have found that, due to their aggression against Egypt, they have suffered political defeat and moral discredit both within and outside the United Nations, and their domestic economies are also unstable.

The announcement of the withdrawal of British troops had been expected shortly after Lloyd's fruitless return from the United Nations last week. The announcement was delayed again and again in order to give the government time to decide how to announce the withdrawal and to formulate future strategies.

It is believed that the so-called "phased withdrawal," which has been heavily publicized here before the official announcement, is part of the government's new strategy. It will serve three purposes. First, by announcing the withdrawal, even though it is only a phased withdrawal, it will help alleviate the growing pressure for withdrawal at home and abroad. Second, because the withdrawal is only "phased," it can serve as a face-saving measure and help reduce the pressure from extreme right-wing Conservatives who threaten to split the party and demand to stay in Egypt. Finally, and quite importantly, the actual withdrawal can be "phased" to such an extent that it is neither an immediate withdrawal nor an unconditional withdrawal.

Well-informed sources point out that the conditions for the "phased withdrawal" will include: First, United Nations forces will remain on Egyptian territory along the Suez Canal until the Suez Canal is cleared and ultimately subject to "international control." Second, the canal clearing work should begin immediately, without waiting for the complete withdrawal of British and French troops. The salvage equipment should include British salvage equipment to give the British another excuse to stay in the canal zone. Third, United Nations forces will remain on the Egyptian-Israeli border until a final settlement is reached.

The essence of these conditions is to obtain from Egypt what the British and French troops did not obtain in the war; and more importantly, it is reported that these conditions are supported by the United States, which is manipulating behind the scenes.

### 妄想夺取在战争中没有取得的东西　英法分阶段撤军计划包藏祸心

　  妄想夺取在战争中没有取得的东西
　　英法分阶段撤军计划包藏祸心
    新华社伦敦3日电　本社记者彭迪报道：英国外交大臣劳埃德12 月3日要在下院宣布政府对从埃及撤退进攻部队问题的决定。虽然还没有正式证实，但是这里普遍的印象是，英国和法国已经决定有条件地“分阶段撤退”他们的进攻部队。
    据说，这个早就该宣布的决定是在11月30日法国外交部长比诺飞到这里来同英国政府领导人会谈的时候作出的。因为两国政府发现，由于它们对埃及的侵略，它们在联合国内和联合国外，已经在政治上遭到失败，道义上信誉扫地，而国内的经济也动荡不安。
    在上星期劳埃德从联合国一无成就回来以后不久，人们就预料要宣布撤退英国军队了。宣布的时间拖了又拖，为的是给政府决定宣布撤退的方式和拟定以后的策略以时间。
    人们认为，在正式宣布决定以前就在这里大事宣传的所谓“分阶段撤退”是政府新策略的一部分。它将有三个作用。第一，由于宣布撤退，虽然它只是分阶段撤退，它将有助于减轻国内外日益增加的要求撤退的压力。第二，由于撤退只是“分阶段”的，它可以作为保全面子的办法，并且有助于减少扬言要分裂党的极端右翼保守党人要求留在埃及的压力。最后相当重要的一点是，实际的撤退可以“分阶段”到这种地步：它既不是立即撤退，也不是无条件撤退。
    消息灵通人士指出，“分阶段撤退”的条件将包括：第一，在苏伊士运河清理和最后归“国际管制”以前，联合国部队将一直驻在苏伊士运河沿岸的埃及领土上。第二，运河清理工作立即开始，而不必等待英法军队全部撤退。打捞设备中应当包括英国的打捞设备，以使英国人有另一个借口留在运河区。第三，联合国部队将留在埃以边境一直到最后解决。
    这些条件的实质是要从埃及那里取得英法军队在战争中所没有取得的东西；而更为重要的是，据悉，这些条件是得到在幕后操纵的美国的支持的。
