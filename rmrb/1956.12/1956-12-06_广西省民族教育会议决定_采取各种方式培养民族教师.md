　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 5th. The Second Guangxi Provincial Ethnic Education Conference decided to adopt diverse methods to train teachers.

    This year, the number of ethnic middle schools in Guangxi Province increased from 77 to 175, the number of ethnic normal schools increased from 7 to 8, and the number of ethnic elementary schools is initially estimated to be 15,654. The ethnic education cause in the province has greatly developed in quantity, but the improvement in quality has not kept up with the requirements of the objective situation. This is mainly due to insufficient teacher training. The conference believes that in the future, in addition to strengthening the leadership of normal schools, specific arrangements should be made for teachers' on-the-job learning, rotational training, correspondence courses, organized visits, and specialized conferences. The conference decided to establish teachers' spare-time advanced studies schools in remote mountainous areas and equip them with full-time itinerant instructors to improve teachers' professional skills.

    The representatives believed that in elementary schools in minority areas, it is necessary to teach in the local ethnic language. Some Han and Zhuang elementary school teachers in the Da Miao Mountain Miao Autonomous County and Jingxi and other counties patiently studied ethnic languages, used Chinese characters or phonetic symbols to record the languages, vocabulary of the Miao and Yao ethnic groups, compiled them into manuals, and gradually used them in classroom teaching, which achieved good results. These experiences were introduced in detail at the conference.

    This conference closed on the 3rd, lasting eight days. Zhao Lequn (Zhuang nationality), Deputy Director of the Education Department of Guangxi Province, conveyed the spirit of the Second National Ethnic Education Conference to the representatives attending the conference and made a report on the ethnic education work of the province.

    On the closing day of the conference, Wei Guoqing (Zhuang nationality), Governor of Guangxi Province, made a report on the issue of developing the quantity and improving the quality of ethnic minority schools.

    广西省民族教育会议决定
　　采取各种方式培养民族教师
　　新华社南宁5日电　广西省第二次民族教育会议决定采取多种多样的方式来培养教师。
    今年，广西省民族中学由七十七所增加到一百七十五所，民族师范由七所增加到八所，民族小学据初步统计共有一万五千六百五十四所。全省民族教育事业在数量上有了很大的发展，但是在质量的提高上还赶不上客观形势的要求。这主要是由于师资培养不够。会议认为今后除了加强师范学校的领导以外，对教师的在职学习、抽调轮训、举办函授、组织参观和举行专科会议等工作，都要进行具体的安排。会议决定在边远山区举办教师业余进修学校，配备专职的巡回辅导员，以提高教师的业务水平。
    代表们认为在少数民族地区的小学校里，需要用当地民族语言教学。大苗山苗族自治县和靖西等县有些汉族和僮族的小学教师，耐心学习民族语言，用汉字或注音符号来纪录苗族和瑶族的语言、词汇，编成手册，逐步用于课堂教学，收到了良好效果。这些经验在会议上都作了详细的介绍。
    这次会议在3日闭幕，共开了八天。广西省教育厅副厅长赵乐群（僮族）向出席会议的代表传达了全国第二次民族教育会议的精神，并作了全省民族教育工作的报告。
    会议闭幕这天，广西省省长韦国清（僮族）就少数民族学校发展数量和提高质量问题作了报告。
