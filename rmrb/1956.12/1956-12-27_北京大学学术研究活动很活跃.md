Peking University's Academic Research Activities Are Very Active

    (Our dispatch) Since the beginning of this semester, Peking University's academic activities have become increasingly active, and the atmosphere of free discussion has also become stronger, resulting in a new look in teaching and scientific research activities.
    The faculty of the entire university has now proposed more than 500 scientific research topics for the year 1957. The Foreign Philosophy History Teaching and Research Office is preparing to study the thoughts of idealist philosophers such as Kant and Hegel, and the Chinese Literature History and Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Offices are preparing to study ancient Chinese literature and philosophical thought. Li Ruqi, who has been engaged in genetics research for more than 30 years, is currently studying the genetics of white mice.
    Peking University's more than 80 teaching and research offices have held a total of more than 400 scientific discussion meetings, such as the boundary layer theory discussion group led by Zhou Peiyuan and Zhou Guangjiong, and the topology discussion group led by Jiang Zehan and Liao Shantao. The Linguistics Teaching and Research Office of the Chinese Department recently discussed Gao Mingkai's "Grammatical Categories," and the Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Office of the Philosophy Department discussed Zhang Dainian's "Research on the Book of Transformation." Some discussions have studied current major theoretical issues, such as the fixed interest rate issue.
    In terms of course offerings, the Philosophy Department has introduced courses introducing bourgeois theories this semester (such as Russell's philosophy), and will offer Hegel studies next semester. The Economics Department will offer introductions to and critiques of Keynes, and the Biology Department is organizing lectures on the basic principles of Mendel and Morgan. When professors lecture, they introduce different viewpoints more objectively. When Hu Zhongda of the World History Teaching and Research Office lectured on the social nature of Babylon, he introduced the views of Tong Shuye of Shandong University and explained his own views. When Wu Zuxiang and He Qifang lectured on "Dream of the Red Chamber," their analysis of the character Xue Baochai was very different, and they each explained their own views. The Philosophy Department will hold a discussion meeting in January next year on some basic issues in the study of Chinese philosophy history, discussing the object and scope of Chinese philosophy history, whether there are materialist factors in traditional Chinese historical views and ethical thought, and how to inherit China's philosophical heritage, and so on.
    A variety of reports have attracted a wide range of teachers and students. Some of these reports were held to commemorate great historical figures. The History Department invited Ding Zeliang to give a report on "Sun Yat-sen's Influence on the Asian National Liberation Movement," the Chinese Department held a report meeting to commemorate Lu Xun, and the Physics Department held report meetings on Einstein and Fermi. Some reports also invite scholars from inside and outside the university to make special reports. The Chemistry Department invited Professor Wuthilo, director of the Chemistry Department of Humboldt University in Germany, who has been studying phosphates and silicates for more than 20 years, to give a report on "Condensed Phosphate Blocks," and the Chinese Department invited Lu Kanru, Liu Dajie, and Zhou Yang to give reports on the history of Chinese literature and the situation of literary and art work.

    北京大学学术研究活动很活跃
    本报讯　本学期开学以来，北京大学的学术活动日趋活跃，自由讨论的风气也浓厚起来了，在教学和科学研究活动中出现了新气象。
    全校教师现在共拟出1957年度科学研究题目五百多个。外国哲学史教研室准备研究康德、黑格尔等唯心论哲学家的思想，中国文学史和中国哲学史教研室准备研究中国古代文学、哲学思想。有三十多年从事遗传学研究的李汝祺正研究白耗子的遗传问题。
    北京大学的八十多个教研室一共举行四百多次科学讨论会，如周培源和周光烱领导的边界层理论讨论班，江泽涵和廖山涛领导的拓扑学讨论班等。中文系语言学教研室最近讨论了高名凯的“语法范畴”，哲学系中国哲学史教研室讨论了张岱年的“化书研究”。有的讨论会对当前重大理论问题，如定息问题作了研究。
    在课程的开设上，这学期哲学系开出了介绍资产阶级学说的课程（如罗素的哲学），下学期将开黑格尔研究。经济系将开凯恩斯的介绍和批判，生物系正在组织有关孟德尔、摩尔根基本原理的讲座。教授在讲课时，对各家不同的观点，都比较客观地作了介绍。世界史教研室胡钟达在讲授巴比伦的社会性质时，介绍了山东大学童书叶的看法，并说明了他自己的见解。吴组缃和何其芳在讲授“红楼梦”时，对薛宝钗这一人物的分析就很不同，他们各自说明了自己的看法。哲学系将在明年一月举行一次中国哲学史研究中的一些基本问题的讨论会，讨论的问题是中国哲学史的对象和范围是什么，中国传统的历史观和伦理思想中有无唯物主义的因素，以及怎样对中国哲学遗产的继承，等等。
    多种多样的报告会吸引了广大的教师和学生。在这些报告会中，有些是为了纪念伟大的历史人物而举办的。历史系请了丁则良作“孙中山对亚洲民族解放运动的影响”的报告，中文系举办了纪念鲁迅的报告会，物理系举办了爱因斯坦和费米的报告会。也有些报告会是请校内外学者作专题报告。化学系请了研究磷酸盐和硅酸盐达二十多年的德国洪堡大学化学系主任伍梯罗教授作了“缩聚磷酸块”的报告，中文系请了陆侃如、刘大杰和周扬作了关于中国文学史和文艺工作情况的报告。　（井杰）
