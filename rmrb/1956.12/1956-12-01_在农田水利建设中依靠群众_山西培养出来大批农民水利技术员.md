Relying on the Masses in Farmland Irrigation Construction
　　Shanxi Cultivates a Large Number of Farmer Water Conservancy Technicians

　　(Our newspaper dispatch) Shanxi Province has cultivated a large number of farmer water conservancy technicians in the process of this year's large-scale farmland irrigation construction.

　　The enthusiasm of agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province for building water conservancy projects is very high. However, in the past, because farmers did not understand water conservancy technology and there was a great lack of water conservancy technical personnel, the quality of the completed water conservancy projects was not high, and many useless wells and abandoned canals were built. In order to solve this difficulty, the government's water conservancy departments have run many training classes, but because the trainees were mostly village and township cadres, after they finished their studies and returned to their hometowns, they rarely devoted their main efforts to water conservancy technical work because they were busy with other work.

　　In the spring of this year, a large-scale farmland irrigation construction movement was launched throughout the province. In order to impart water conservancy technology to farmers, the water conservancy departments also ran training classes, selecting old farmers and young farmers who love water conservancy work and have practical experience in building water conservancy projects as training objects. Using the method of working and learning at the same time, more than 50,000 water conservancy technicians were trained. Technical guidance stations were set up at key construction sites, with water conservancy technical cadres from the county serving as counselors to help farmer water conservancy technicians solve difficulties in their work at any time; and experience exchanges were frequently organized. Local agricultural cooperatives also made reasonable solutions to the issue of compensation for farmer water conservancy technicians; those with creative inventions were given material or spiritual rewards.

　　Because a large number of farmer technicians have been trained, various places have not only gradually overcome the difficulty of insufficient water conservancy technical forces, but also greatly improved the quality of projects, basically eliminating abandoned canals, and the number of abandoned wells has also been greatly reduced. The area of irrigated land in Shanxi Province this year has exceeded the total area of irrigated land developed in the six years since liberation. At present, the province has a total of 11.64 million mu of irrigated land, with an average of nine fen of irrigated land per agricultural person.

　　Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau decided that this winter and next spring, it will train another 200 to 300 farmer water conservancy technicians in key water conservancy counties, and 100 to 200 in general counties, so that agricultural cooperatives with the conditions will have three to five water conservancy technicians. The Water Conservancy Bureau will strengthen its leadership over them in actual work, and organize experience exchanges and mutual learning at any time to continuously improve their technical level.

### 在农田水利建设中依靠群众　山西培养出来大批农民水利技术员

　　在农田水利建设中依靠群众
　　山西培养出来大批农民水利技术员
    本报讯　山西省在今年的大规模兴修农田水利的过程中，培养出大批的农民水利技术员。
    山西省各地农业社兴修水利的积极性很高，但是，在过去，由于农民不懂得水利技术知识，水利技术人材很缺乏，因此，修成的水利工程质量不高，造了许多瞎井废渠。政府水利部门，为了解决这一困难，曾经开办过不少训练班，但是因为受训者多是村乡干部，他们学完回乡，因为别的工作忙很少能拿出主要力量作水利技术工作。
    今年春季，全省开展了大规模的兴修农田水利运动。为了把水利技术交给农民，水利部门又开办了训练班，选择热爱水利事业，并具有兴修水利工程实际经验的老农和青年农民作为训练对象，以一面工作，一面学习的方法，培养了五万多名水利技术员。在重点工程工地，都设有技术辅导站，由县的水利技术干部作辅导员，随时帮助农民水利技术员解决工作中的困难；并经常组织经验交流。各地农业社对农民水利技术员的报酬问题，也作了合理的解决；对有创造发明的人，更给予物质上或精神上的奖励。
    因为培养出了大批的农民技术员，各地不仅逐步克服了水利技术力量不足的困难，并且大大提高了工程质量，基本上消灭了废渠，废井也极少了。山西省今年的水浇地面积，已超过解放后六年来发展的水浇地的总和，目前全省共有水浇地一千一百六十四万亩，平均每一个农业人口有水浇地九分。
    最近，山西省水利局决定，今冬明春在水利重点县再训练农民水利技术员二百至三百名，一般县训练一百至二百名，使有条件的农业社拥有三至五名水利技术员。水利局将在实际工作中加强对他们的领导，随时组织经验交流和互相学习，不断提高他们的技术水平。
