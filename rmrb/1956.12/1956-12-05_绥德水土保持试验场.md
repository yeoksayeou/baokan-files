　　Suide Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Farm
　　Ye Ping
　　In the past, what one saw in the Suide area of northern Shaanxi was a loess plateau and crisscrossing gullies. There was no grass on the mountains, no trees in the gullies, and after a gust of yellow wind, the sun was not visible for half a day; after a rainstorm, the gullies were filled with yellow mud. For many years, the hardworking people hoped to fundamentally transform this harsh natural environment. This beautiful wish of the people is now beginning to become a reality at the Suide Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Farm.

　　Not far from the east gate of Suide, small patches of lush green can be seen constantly on the steep slopes on both sides of the gully. As you walk further, there is more and more green. This is the Suide Soil and Water Conservation Experimental Farm. The area of this farm is not large, including all the slopes and barren cliffs, about two thousand mu of land, occupying several small gullies, like a green island in the boundless ocean of loess. It shines like a green gem in the hearts of millions of farmers around.

　　Starting from the headquarters of the experimental farm and walking towards the first experimental gully, large areas of fresh and tender alfalfa and three-year-old black locust saplings protect the steep slopes. Bypassing the steep slope forest area and reaching the gentle slope area on the upper layer of the mountain slope, there are many small plots underfoot, some of which are still dense with tender grass, and some of which have opened countless colorful small flowers. This is the pasture introduction observation area. Through observation and comparison, many excellent pastures suitable for development from other provinces and countries have been selected, some of which have been widely promoted, and some are being massively propagated in preparation for promotion.

　　At the head of the first experimental gully is a large, not insignificant,簸箕掌 [bo ji zhang - a type of landform, roughly translatable as "dustpan palm"], where the floods from the three-sided slopes fall into a gully about thirty meters deep. In the past, whenever there was a rainstorm, the gully head would always advance more than ten steps forward. Historically, countless flat gully palms have been washed into steep barren gullies. Now, the development of this gully head has stopped. Look: the three terraced ridges, one above the other on the dustpan palm, are as straight as three battlefield defense lines, controlling the water flow layer by layer, preventing floods from concentrating at the gully head. Outside the defense line is a wide pasture belt, and outside the grass belt, bordering the severely collapsed embankment, is a shrub belt. These grass belts and shrub belts extend to both sides of the gully head, winding forward along the edge of the mound, like a beautiful green lace, protecting the entire upper soil slope. Judging from the head-to-tail connected green belt, the collapse of the edge of this mountain slope has stopped. At the top of the mountain is a tree species combination test area, with trees such as cypress, black locust, elm, and ailanthus, as well as one hundred and several dozen seedlings directly transplanted from old forests south of Yan'an, most of which are now surviving. According to the comrades who guided us on the visit, mountain peach and mountain cherry blossoms also bloom here in large areas in the spring. Apples and grapes are also planted on the hillside, and these fruit trees are growing very vigorously.

　　In the second gully, the most eye-catching thing is a large silt dam nine meters high. From the outside, one can tell that this earth dam has been preserved in the struggle against violent mountain torrents. The outer half of the earth dam has been completely washed away by water, and the complete dam top has blocked a full reservoir of mud, silting up more than ten mu of fertile land.

　　It is this kind of dammed land that has huge potential for drought resistance and high yield. According to comrades at the farm, in last year's unprecedented drought, the county averaged only thirty-three jin of autumn grain per mu, while the yield of the dammed land was two hundred and eighty-seven jin and twelve liang per mu. The experimental farm has already silted up dams, and now has built a well capable of irrigating twenty mu of land, and will soon implement a two-crop-a-year irrigation cultivation system. Speaking of this well, it is also a miracle. The well was dug on the bottom of the dry gully's stone slab, and no one believed that water could be drawn out. Tian Lizhen, the engineering captain of the Soil and Water Conservation Station, came from an old river worker family. Ignoring the ridicule of others, he always drilled and blasted downwards, and as a result, only five meters deep, the spring water gushed out. While digging and tapping, the water level rose to one and a half meters high during the time the workers ate a meal. According to the draft of the Suide Prefecture's twelve-year plan, the eight counties will dam and silt up a total of 450,000 mu of land. The highest yield of dry dammed land can reach 300 jin per mu. If it is converted to irrigated land, changing one crop to two crops, each mu can produce 700 jin, and 450,000 mu can produce a total of 315 million jin, which is higher than the current annual total output of the entire prefecture. The experimental farm plans to fully realize one well per dam and universal irrigation after the autumn and before next spring. This kind of well irrigation is a top cheap production increase measure in the local area, because according to the ancient method of digging wells in dry riverland, one well costs three to four thousand yuan, and at most it can irrigate twenty mu of land, averaging one hundred and fifty to two hundred yuan per mu. The investment in small and medium-sized water conservancy projects that divert gully water to irrigate fields often requires more than one hundred yuan per mu. However, this well dug in the dammed land only cost one hundred and fifty yuan, and it can also irrigate twenty mu of land, which only costs seven yuan and five jiao per mu. The nearby masses are very happy, and agricultural cooperatives with dammed land are preparing to do the same.

　　After seeing the well, we turned and headed northwest, entering a small turning gully. From here we went up the mountain and saw the main forest area for afforestation from afar. A miracle of high yield has appeared in the wheat stubble field under a row of black locust trees. Last year, northern Shaanxi experienced an unprecedented drought, and the average wheat yield in the entire prefecture was only thirteen jin per mu, but this grass-field rotation land of the experimental farm yielded as much as one hundred and sixty-six jin per mu.

　　Walking along the edge of the forest area, we arrived at the meteorological garden in the central area of the experimental farm. In addition to observing the weather, it also manages twenty-four "runoff plots." This year is the year with the most rainstorms in the three and a half years since the establishment of the farm. Fortunately, the entire farm is protected by layers of terraced ridges and horizontal ditches, and the average amount of mud retained per mu of sloping farmland is as high as twelve cubic meters, so the mud and water flowing down the mountain is not serious.

　　Turning past the meteorological garden and passing through the main forest area to the north, we entered the most important agricultural experimental area of the entire farm. In the past three years, the average yield here has never been less than one hundred and seventy jin per mu, and sometimes it has exceeded two hundred jin. The reason is simply that the soil and water erosion has been controlled through terraced ridge and furrow cultivation, and some fertilizer has been applied. Here, we have initially seen the prospects for agricultural production in mountainous areas.

　　绥德水土保持试验场
　　也平
    过去，在陕北绥德地区，看到的是一片黄土高原和纵横的沟壑，山上没有草，沟里没有树，一阵黄风过后，半天不见太阳；一阵暴雨过后，山沟里积满了黄色的泥浆。勤劳的人民多少年来就希望把这种恶劣的自然环境从根本上加以改造。人民的这个美好的愿望，如今在绥德水土保持试验场已经开始变为现实了。
    出绥德东门不远，山沟两旁陡坡上，就不断看到小片浓绿。再向前走，绿色越多了。这就是绥德水土保持试验场。这个场的面积不大，所有坡地和荒崖峭壁都在内，约有两千多亩地，占着好几个小山沟，好像无边黄土海洋中的绿色孤岛。它像绿宝石一般地照亮了周围千千万万农民的心。
    从试验场本部出发，向第一条试验沟走去，有大片鲜嫩的草木樨和三年生的刺槐幼林保护着陡峻山坡。绕过陡坡林区，到了山坡上层的缓坡地带，脚下是许多小区，有的小区还是稠密的嫩草，有的小区里已开放了无数缤纷的小花。这就是牧草引种观察区。通过观察比较，把许多适宜开展的外省的和国外的优良牧草选出来，有些牧草已经大量推广；有些正在大量繁殖，准备推广。
    第一试验沟的沟头，是一个不小的簸箕掌，三面坡上的洪水都在这一点上落入约三十公尺深的山沟。以往每逢暴雨，沟头总要向前发展十几步。历来不知道多少平缓的沟掌被冲成了峭壁荒沟。现在，这个沟头已经停止发展了。看吧：簸箕掌上的上下三条梯田埂，直如三条战场防线，层层控制着水流，不让洪水集中到沟头来。防线以外，又是宽宽的牧草带，草带外边临接塌方严重的地畔是灌木带。这些草带和灌木带向沟头两边延长，弯弯曲曲地跟着峁边前进，宛如一条美丽的绿花边，保护着整个上层土坡。从头尾相连的绿带看来，这座山坡边沿的塌崩已经中止了。山顶上是树种组合试验区，山顶有柏树、刺槐、榆树、椿树等树木，还有直接从延安以南的老林移来的一百几十种苗木，现在大部分也成活了。据引导我们参观的同志谈，春天这里还大片地开放了山桃和山樱桃花。在山坡上还种植苹果和葡萄，这些果树都生长的很茁壮。
    第二个山沟里，最引人注目的是一个九公尺高的大型淤地坝。从外面一看，就知道这个土坝是在同暴烈的山洪作斗争中保存下来的，土坝的外半部全部被水冲掉了，全线完整的坝顶，挡下了满库泥浆，淤成展平的十多亩良田。
    就是这种坝地，具有巨大的抗旱丰产潜力。据场里的同志们介绍，去年空前大旱灾中，全县平均每亩只打三十三斤秋粮，坝地的产量是每亩二百八十七斤十二两。试验场已经淤平的坝里，现在已打成能浇地二十亩的一个水井，即将实行一年两熟制的灌溉耕作。说起这个井，也是一个奇迹，井是在干沟的石板底子上打的，谁都不信能打出水来。水土保持站的工程队长田利贞，是老河工出身，他不顾别人讽笑，总是一钻一炮地向下打，结果只打到五公尺深，泉水就冒出来了。一边掏一边打，工人吃一顿饭的时间，水位又到一公尺半高。按照绥德专区十二年规划的草案，八个县一共要打坝淤地四十五万亩。旱坝地产量最高每亩可达三百斤，如果改为水浇地，改一熟为两熟，每亩可产七百斤，四十五万亩共可产三亿一千五百万斤，比目下全专区的常年总产量还高。试验场准备在秋后和明年春前全部实现一坝一井，普遍灌溉。这种井浇地在当地是一种顶便宜的增产措施，因为按照古老方式在旱川地打井，一个井要用三、四千元，至多能浇二十亩地，每亩均摊一百五十元至二百元。引沟水灌田的中小型水利的投资，往往每亩也需要一百元以上。但在坝地打成的这一眼井只用了一百五十元，也能浇地二十亩，每亩只要七元五角就够了。附近群众十分高兴，已有坝地的农业社都准备照样干。
    看过水井，我们转弯改向西北行，进入一个小拐沟，从这里上山，远远看见满山绿化的主要林区。在一行刺槐树下的那片麦槎地，出现过丰产的奇迹。去年陕北空前大旱，全专区的小麦每亩平均只收十三斤，但试验场的这一块草田轮作地，每亩竟收了一百六十六斤。
    走过林区边沿，到了试验场中心地带的气象园。这里除了观测气象，还管理着二十四个“径流小区”。今年是建场三年半来暴雨最多的一年，幸亏全场有重重叠叠的梯田埂和水平沟挡着，每亩坡田平均拦泥量达十二公方之多，泥水下山还不严重。
    转过气象园，向北经过主要林区，就进入全场最重要的农业试验区。三年来这里每亩平均产量从来没有少于一百七十斤，有时还超过二百斤。原因只是通过梯田沟垅耕作，控制了水土冲刷，并增施了一些肥料。在这里，我们初步看见了山区农业生产的前景。
