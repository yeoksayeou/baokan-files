    National Song and Dance Festival to be Held Soon in Beijing
    (Our newspaper's report) The first National Song and Dance Festival will open in Beijing on January 3rd next year.
    For the past few months, music and dance workers from all over the country have been actively preparing performances. Currently, programs have been reported from nineteen delegations, including the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Gansu, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, the Central National Song and Dance Troupe, the Sichuan-Gansu-Qinghai Border Work Group, and the systems of the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Geology, totaling 221 programs. Among them are 100 ethnic, folk, and classical dances, 9 dance dramas, 87 vocal programs, and 14 instrumental music programs.
    The joint office for the festival, established in mid-November by the Ministry of Culture, the Nationalities Affairs Commission, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, plans to hold discussion meetings on issues such as choreography and creation, design issues, actor performance, and training and improvement during the festival. It will also organize some thematic reports, exhibitions, and visits. In addition, after the closing of the festival, a symposium on the work of song and dance troupes will be held to study the guidelines and tasks of song and dance troupes (teams) at all levels and types under the Ministry of Culture, the planning of professional song and dance undertakings, and how professional song and dance troupes can further integrate with the masses, as well as to exchange work experiences of song and dance troupes (teams).
    The festival schedule is from January 3rd to January 22nd, with fifteen different evening performances. Each evening, performances will be held simultaneously in the Tianqiao, People's, and Capital Theaters, with matinee performances added on Sundays. In order to meet the demands of the capital's audience as much as possible, it is planned to sell more than 50% of the tickets. Considering the issue of workers, soldiers, and students in the suburbs watching performances, it is also planned to organize more than ten touring performances.
