Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 30th. According to TASS, Paris, 29th: "L'Humanité" published a statement by the French Communist Party on the devastating consequences of France's aggressive policies in North Africa and the Middle East on the French economy and politics. The statement pointed out that the blows to the French economy and finance caused by this aggressive policy are becoming increasingly apparent. France has already experienced great difficulties in supplying petroleum products. Not only are fuel supplies to automobiles restricted, but the heating of hospitals, schools, and homes is also threatened, as electricity, gas, and coal consumption have also been restricted. The statement continued that the disruption of the normal development of the national economy has severely worsened the situation of the working class, and many people are living in misery. In the automobile industry and related production sectors, 500,000 workers are threatened with wage cuts and partial unemployment, and some are already facing the threat of being laid off. One-third of the country's power industry resources rely on oil, so a lack of petroleum products threatens many industrial sectors. Agriculture will also encounter great difficulties. All of this will inevitably lead to rising prices.

Since ships from the Far East and the Middle East now have to go around the Cape of Good Hope, transportation costs have increased by 15% to 20%. The electricity fee for industrial use is stipulated to increase by 10% to 15%. What threatens France even more is a substantial reduction in exports and a substantial increase in dollar expenditures due to increased imports from the dollar zone.

The statement pointed out that all of this inevitably worsens the balance of foreign trade. Moreover, the foreign trade deficit already exceeds 300 billion francs. The statement also pointed out the increase in military spending reaching 1.5 trillion francs and the danger of inflation.

The statement said that this is the result the government has brought to the country. The government is implementing an anti-national colonialist policy that serves the selfish purposes of the big bourgeoisie and reactionary parties, bringing France to the brink of collapse and impoverishing the working masses.

The government of Guy Mollet, captured by the Popular Republican Movement and the "Independent Republican Peasant Union" (the Popular Republican Movement is a clerical party, and the "Independent Republican Peasant Union" is a right-wing bourgeois group), has wavered in its position and is implementing a policy that favors the reactionaries, even though this policy was condemned in the January 2nd National Assembly elections.

The statement emphasized that in order to safeguard the interests of the working class, the French Communist Party demands compensation for every worker for the part of their wages that has been deprived due to the current situation and prohibits any layoffs; the closed mines should be reopened immediately to employ the necessary number of miners; fuel should be supplied, first and foremost to hospitals, schools, and working people's homes; coal should be distributed to working people's families at the original prices; and rent increases should be stopped immediately.

The statement said that the French Communist Party, expressing the wishes of the French people, advocates preventing the threat of a new world war, and therefore demands: "The immediate withdrawal of all French armed forces from Egypt and Cyprus; the cessation of military operations in Algeria and the commencement of negotiations on resolving this issue; the implementation of disarmament policies based on Soviet proposals and the convening of a five-power conference as suggested by the Swiss government."

In order to safeguard the French economy, the Communist Party proposes the following: immediately stop purchasing American military materials to reduce dollar expenditures, and prosper the French economy by developing trade relations with Eastern countries and the People's Republic of China; implement democratic tax reforms to force capitalists to pay taxes, thereby ensuring budget balance and currency stability; implement a program to develop national power resources and train hundreds of thousands of engineers, technicians, and skilled workers.

The statement concluded, "The country needs a government that conforms to the interests of the republican majority shown in the January 2, 1956 elections; that meets the demands of workers, working farmers, office workers, and all small and medium-sized residents; that cares about spiritual wealth; and that safeguards peace and freedom."

    法国共产党就当前局势发表声明
    指责政府侵略政策使法国濒于崩溃
    要求采取和平措施并维护劳动人民利益
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社巴黎29日讯：“人道报”刊载了法国共产党就法国在北非和中东的侵略政策给法国经济和政治带来的毁灭性后果发表的声明。声明指出，这种侵略政策使法国经济和财政遭到的打击越来越明显。法国在供应石油产品方面已经发生了很大的困难。现在不仅限制对汽车的燃料供应，医院、学校、住宅的保暖问题也受到威胁，因为电力、煤气和煤的消费也已经实行限制。声明接着说，国民经济正常发展遭到的破坏使工人阶级的境况严重恶化了，许多人的生活苦不堪言。在汽车工业和与汽车工业有关的生产部门中，有五十万工人受到降低工资和部分失业的威胁，而有些人已经面临着被解雇的威胁。国家的动力工业的资源有三分之一要靠石油保证，因此，缺乏石油产品，许多工业部门就要受到威胁。农业也要遇到很大困难。这一切都不可避免地要引起物价的上涨。
    由于从远东和中东来的船现在不得不绕道好望角，因此运输费用提高了15％到20％。供工业用的电力费规定提高10％至15％。威胁着法国的还有出口额大大缩减和由于增加了从美元区来的输入而大大增加的美元开支。
    声明指出，这一切情况不可避免地使对外贸易的平衡更加恶化。而且，对外贸易的逆差现在就已经超过了三千亿法郎。声明还指出达到一万五千亿法郎的军费的增加以及通货膨胀的危险性。
    声明说，这就是政府使国家面临的结果。政府执行符合大资产阶级和反动党派的自私目的的、反民族的殖民主义政策，使得法国濒于崩溃，并且使劳动群众陷于贫困。
    居伊·摩勒政府作了人民共和党和“独立共和农民联盟”（人民共和党是教权派的党派，“独立共和农民联盟”是右翼资产阶级集团）的俘虏，它的立场已经动摇了，而且它所执行的是有利于反动派的政策，虽然这种政策在1月2日的国民议会选举中已经受到谴责。
    声明着重指出，法国共产党为了维护工人阶级的利益，要求补偿每一个工人由于目前的局势而被剥夺的一部分工资并且禁止任何解雇；关闭的矿井立刻复工以使必要数目的矿工就业；供应燃料，首先是给医院、学校和劳动人民住家供应燃料；按照原先的价格分配煤给劳动人民家庭；立刻停止增加房租。
    声明说，法国共产党表达法国人民的愿望，主张防止新的世界大战的威胁，为此要求：“法国一切武装部队立即撤出埃及和塞浦路斯；停止对阿尔及利亚的军事行动，开始举行有关解决这个问题的谈判；根据苏联的建议执行裁军政策和按照瑞士政府的建议召开五大国会议。”
    为了维护法国的经济，共产党提出建议如下：立即停止购买美国军用物资以减少美元开支，并且通过发展同东方国家和中华人民共和国的贸易关系来繁荣法国的经济；实行民主税制改革以迫使资本家付税，从而保证预算平衡和稳定通货；实施发展国家动力富源和培养几十万工程师、技术人员和熟练工人的纲领。
    声明最后说，“国家需要的是这样一个政府：它要符合1956年1月2日选举时表现出来的维护共和制的多数的利益；它要满足工人、劳动农民、机关工作人员以及一切中小阶层居民的要求；它要关心精神财富；它要维护和平和自由。”
