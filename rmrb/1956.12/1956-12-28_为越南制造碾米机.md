Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. The Wuxi Joint State-Private Wuxi Food Machinery Factory completed its task of producing sixty-nine rice milling machines for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today, ahead of schedule. Once these machines are put into production, they can produce 800,000 to 900,000 kilograms of brown rice per day. After inspection by relevant departments, this batch of machines all meet the specified quality requirements, some of which have already been shipped to Vietnam, and some are being packed for shipment.

The rice milling machines produced by Wuxi Food Machinery Factory for Vietnam include eight types of automated rice milling plant equipment, such as rice hullers, rice washing machines, refined rice impurity removal machines, and paddy awn removing machines. Four of these eight types of rice milling machines are not available or rarely available in Chinese rice mills. The refined rice impurity removal machine with a steel structure is the first of its kind to be manufactured in China. It was designed and improved by the technical personnel of Wuxi Food Machinery Factory based on the wooden-structured cooling rice machine and rice polishing machine.

    为越南制造碾米机
    新华社南京26日电　无锡市公私合营无锡食品机械厂今天提前完成了为越南民主共和国生产六十九台碾米机器的任务。这批机器投入生产，可以日产糙米八十——九十万公斤。这批机器经有关部门检验，都合乎规定的质量要求，其中有的已经运往越南，有的正装箱待运。
    无锡食品机械厂为越南生产的碾米机器有砻谷机、涮米机、精米除杂机、稻谷除芒机等八种自动化碾米厂的机器设备。这八种碾米机器中有四种是我国碾米厂没有或很少有的。钢铁结构的精米除杂机在我国还是第一次制造，这是无锡食品机械厂技术人员根据木结构的凉米机和擦米机改进设计成的。
