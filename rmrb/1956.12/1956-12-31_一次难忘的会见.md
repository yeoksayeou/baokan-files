    An Unforgettable Meeting
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Jingqi
    On December 25th, Wang Weizhou, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and head of the Central Delegation, and Wang Yifu, deputy head of the delegation, led members of the general delegation in an unforgettable meeting with the Yi ethnic group members of the Nanping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chengnan Township, Zhaojue County, Liangshan. This advanced agricultural cooperative was established by thirty-six households of slaves and semi-slaves after they were liberated.
    A few days before, when the news that the general delegation would visit reached this agricultural cooperative, people immediately told each other, and the cooperative's office was almost constantly filled with people inquiring about the date of the delegation's arrival. Young men climbed the high snow-capped mountains to gather green pine branches and build arches. At ten o'clock in the morning, when the delegation arrived by car, people immediately rushed forward to offer large bouquets of flowers. At this long-awaited moment, everyone applauded and cheered to their heart's content.
    In the courtyard of the cooperative, Chairman Wang Weizhou cordially asked female cooperative head Nigu Goge about her background and the situation within the cooperative. This only twenty-four-year-old former "Guozhuang" (slave) sadly recounted the past life of eating wild grass and being tortured, and also talked about being elected as the cooperative head after the reform and visiting other places. She said that in Beijing, Chairman Mao had personally received the visiting group, and now he sent representatives to see them. She would never forget this kind of care. Female cooperative members held the hands of the female comrades in the delegation and smiled. Although they did not speak the same language, every gesture expressed boundless sincerity. "Wajiwa!" (Very good!) and "Hello!" exchanged the most sincere feelings.
    The meeting began. Tubi Aye, the former "Anjia Wazi" (semi-slave) and today's deputy cooperative head, stood up and said, "Today, we cannot describe the joy in our hearts. Please take the words in our hearts to Chairman Mao..."
    Tubi Aye reported on the increase in production and the improvement in the lives of cooperative members this year. When this agricultural cooperative was established in the spring of this year, it lacked everything except land. The government distributed farm tools and loans to help solve the difficulties of means of production. Due to the efforts of the cooperative members, the fields were fertilized more than twice as much as ordinary farmers, the number of weeding times was increased, and the corn cultivation techniques were improved. In the autumn, the grain harvested was more than 30% higher than the yield on the same land last year, and the sideline income was more than 600 yuan. Each cooperative member received 950 jin of grain. Tubi Aye said, "In previous years, these few days were when we were suffering from cold and hunger. This year, for the first time, every family has enough to eat and wear. We deeply feel that the words of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao will never be wrong. We must continue to move towards socialism!"
    Chairman Wang Weizhou said, "On behalf of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, I extend my greetings to you!" He repeatedly congratulated the cooperative members on gaining liberation and freedom. He said, "Implementing democratic reforms and developing mutual aid and cooperation is for the development of the Yi society. At the same time, it is also beneficial to the slave owners. The Party and the government have made arrangements for the future and lives of the slave owners based on the characteristics of the Yi society. In the future, you must also unite them well. I hope you will be more united and work harder to improve your lives. You must become a banner of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation in Liangshan."
    The seventy-year-old Chairman Wang Weizhou took the hand of female cooperative head Nigu Goge and walked with everyone through the green pea fields to the homes of the cooperative members. In the home of Sunzi Wujia, Chairman Wang Weizhou held the hands of the homeowner and his wife and constantly congratulated the newly married couple. In the past, Sunzi Wujia and his mother and four children were all "Guozhuang" in the slave owner's family. It was not until after the reform that they reunited and joined the cooperative. In the past, he had wandered everywhere for a living. With tears in his eyes, he said excitedly, "I have lived for twenty-seven years, and only this year have I had a life like a human being!"
    Chairman Wang Weizhou cordially greeted the cooperative members and shook hands with everyone. The members of the delegation constantly and happily held hands with the cooperative members in the fields and on the village roads to take pictures as souvenirs.
    In front of the new house built by the cooperative for the cooperative members, Mabinilo, wearing new clothes, and her father warmly received every member of the delegation. This twenty-one-year-old girl had been a "Guozhuang" in the slave owner's family since she was a child. Long-term torture has made her still as short and weak as a twelve or thirteen-year-old child. She herself cannot remember the number of times she was beaten, and cannot count the scars on her body. She was snatched from her mother's arms by the slave owner when she was two years old, and she had never been able to see her mother again until she was reunited with her father after the reform. He said to the members of the delegation, "After the reform, I ate rice and wore cloth clothes for the first time. Please tell Chairman Mao that I will thank him all my life." This year, she and her father have already received more than 1,600 jin of grain. The cooperative members all love to tell her story: every day when she returns home from work, she must change into new clothes, put on beads, and sing everywhere. In labor, she is the one who is the most "de xing" in accumulating fertilizer.
    The unforgettable meeting ended. When the members of the Nanping Cooperative waved their hands and watched the delegation's motorcade leave, they kept shouting, "Goodbye, relatives!" (Xinhua News Agency, Zhaojue, 30th)

    一次难忘的会见
    新华社记者　于竞祁
    12月25日，中共中央委员、中央慰问团总团团长王维舟，副团长王一夫率领总团人员，和凉山昭觉县城南乡南坪农业生产合作社的彝族社员们作了一次难忘的会见。这个高级农业社是由三十六户奴隶、半奴隶在获得解放后建立的。
    几天以前，慰问团总团将要来访问的消息传到这个农业社的时候，人们立刻争相走告，社的办公室里几乎每天都不断有人来打听慰问团到来的日期。小伙子们爬上高高的雪山，采回青翠的松枝，扎起牌坊。上午十点，当慰问团人员乘车来到的时候，人们立刻涌上前去献上了大把大把的花束，在这个久已盼望的时刻，人人都尽情地鼓掌欢呼。
    在合作社的院坝上，王维舟团长亲切地向女社长尼古戈角询问着她的身世和社内情况。这个才二十四岁的过去的“锅庄”（奴隶）沉痛地叙述了过去吃野草，受折磨的生活，也谈到改革后当选社长和外出参观的情况。她说：在北京，毛主席曾经亲自接见过参观团，今天又派代表来看她们，这种关怀，她将永远不能忘记。女社员们拉着慰问团女同志的手笑着，她们虽然语言不通，但是每个手势都表达了无限的心意。“哇吉哇！”（好的很！）和“你们好！”的声音交换着最真挚的感情。
    慰问会开始了。过去的“安家娃子”（半奴隶）、今天的副社长土比阿业站起来说：“今天，我们无法形容心里的高兴，请把我们心里的话带给毛主席……”
    土比阿业报告了社内今年增产和社员生活改善的情况。这个农业社在今年春天建立时，除了土地以外，什么东西都很缺，政府发放了农具和贷款，帮助解决了生产资料的困难。由于社员们的努力，田地施肥比一般农民多一倍多，增加了薅草次数，改进了玉米栽培技术，到秋天收获的粮食比去年同样土地产量增加30％多，副业收入六百多元，社员每人光是分到的粮食就有九百五十斤。土比阿业说：“往年这几天我们正是挨冷受饿的时候，今年第一次家家有吃有穿，我们深深感到共产党、毛主席的话永远不会错，我们要继续走向社会主义！”
    王维舟团长说：“我代表中央和毛主席向你们问好！”他一再为社员们获得解放和自由而祝贺。他说：“实行民主改革和发展互助合作，是为了彝族社会的发展，同时对奴隶主个人也是有利的，党和政府根据彝族社会特点对奴隶主的出路和生活都做了安排，今后你们也要很好团结他们。我希望你们更加团结，更加努力生产来改善生活，你们要成为凉山农业互助合作的一面旗帜。”
    七十多岁的王维舟团长拉着女社长尼古戈角的手，和大家一齐走过青绿的豌豆地，来到一个个社员家里。在孙子乌呷的家中，王维舟团长拉着屋主人和他妻子的手不断向这对不久前才结婚的夫妻祝贺。孙子乌呷一家母子四人过去都是奴隶主家中的“锅庄”，直到改革后才团聚并且加入了合作社。过去，他为了生活曾到处流浪。他含着泪珠激动地说：“我活了二十七年，今年才有了像人一样的生活！”
    王维舟团长亲切地向社员们问好，和大家握手。慰问团的人员在田野上、村路边不断地和社员们欢快地拉着手摄影留念。
    在合作社为社员们新修的房子前面，马比尼洛穿着新衣和她父亲一直热情地接待着每个慰问团人员。这个二十一岁的姑娘从小就在奴隶主家当“锅庄”，长期折磨使她至今仍和十二三岁小孩一样矮小瘦弱。她自己也记不清被毒打的次数，数不清身上的伤疤了。她两岁时就被奴隶主从母亲怀中抢去，从此再也没有能够见到母亲，直到改革后才和父亲团聚。他向慰问团人员说：“改革后我第一次吃上饭，穿上布衣服，请你们告诉毛主席，我一生都感谢他。”今年，她们父女已经分到粮食一千六百多斤。社员们都爱传说她的事：她每天劳动回家一定要换上新衣，挂上珠串，到处唱歌，而在劳动中，她是积肥最“得行”的一个。
    难忘的会见结束了。当南坪社社员们挥着手目送着慰问团的车队离开时，还不住地高呼：“亲人们再见！”（新华社昭觉30日电）
