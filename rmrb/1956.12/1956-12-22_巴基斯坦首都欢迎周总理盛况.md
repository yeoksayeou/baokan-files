Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, December 21st: On the afternoon of the 20th, 10,000 people gathered at Karachi Airport to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long. This was the largest number of people to welcome a foreign visitor at the airport. Several thousand people stood in the shape of a crescent and star, as well as the Chinese characters for "Welcome." After the special plane carrying Premier Zhou Enlai and his party arrived here from Rangoon, flying over 2,000 miles, these several thousand people dissolved their original formation and stood in a large arc around the plane.

The airport was decorated with the national flags of China and Pakistan. The welcoming crowd held countless small national flags of China and Pakistan and raised banners with the words "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship!" and "Long Live World Peace!" written in Urdu, Chinese, and English.

After Premier Zhou Enlai disembarked from the plane, Pakistani Prime Minister Suhrawardy stepped forward to shake his hand and express his welcome.

After the national anthems of China and Pakistan were played, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long reviewed the guard of honor.

Prime Minister Suhrawardy delivered a welcome speech at the airport. He said, "We have been looking forward to your visit, and we hope you have a pleasant stay in Pakistan. We will never forget the warm reception we received in China. We hope that during your visit to Pakistan, we can in some way express our gratitude and convey to you our high respect for you and the People's China."

Next, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech. (Full text on the front page)

Prime Minister Suhrawardy introduced the cabinet members, senior government officials, senior military officers, foreign diplomats, leaders of the Pakistan-China Friendship Association, and prominent figures from all walks of life to Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long.

The military secretary of the Pakistani President came to welcome on behalf of the President. As the Pakistani Prime Minister accompanied the distinguished Chinese guests to meet the welcoming crowd, enthusiastic cheers erupted from the airport, and flower petals fell on the Chinese Premier and Vice Premier like snowflakes. Many children and welcoming people presented them with wreaths. Among the welcoming crowd were university students and female students wearing beautiful hats and holding colorful umbrellas. They brought bands and flutes and happily played to express their welcome. Hundreds of balloons and flocks of pigeons were released from the crowd. Many people stood on top of the main airport buildings and on top of buses to cheer for the guests.

Hundreds of thousands of citizens stood along the roads from the airport to the city to welcome the Chinese guests. The closer the motorcade got to the city center, the more crowded the crowds became. They waved and applauded as the cars passed by. The motorcade, escorted by cavalry guards in red uniforms and wielding long guns, entered the Presidential Palace, where the Chinese government leaders will stay during their visit.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long are on a ten-day friendly visit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan at the invitation of the Pakistani government. Pakistani Ambassador to China, Ahmed, Acting Chief of Protocol of the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tayyabji, and Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Geng Biao, went to Rangoon on the 19th to welcome Premier Zhou Enlai and his entourage. They accompanied Premier Zhou's party to Karachi.

    巴基斯坦首都欢迎周总理盛况
    新华社卡拉奇21日电　20日下午，一万人齐集在卡拉奇机场欢迎周恩来总理和贺龙副总理。这是到机场来欢迎外宾访问的人数最多的一次。几千人站成新月和星的形状，以及中文的“欢迎”两字的形状。在周恩来总理一行所乘坐的专机从仰光飞过两千英里的路程到达这里降落以后，这几千人就解散了原来的队形，围着飞机站成了一个很大的弧形。
    机场上挂着中巴两国国旗，欢迎的人群拿着无数的中巴两国的小幅国旗，并且举着上面用乌尔都文、中文和英文写着：“巴中友谊万岁！”，“世界和平万岁！”的旗帜。
    周恩来总理下飞机以后，巴基斯坦总理苏拉瓦底走上前去同他握手，表示欢迎。
    在演奏了中巴两国国歌以后，周恩来总理和贺龙副总理检阅了仪仗队。
    苏拉瓦底总理在机场上致词欢迎。他说：“我们一直在盼望你来访问，我们希望你在巴基斯坦访问期间过得很愉快。我们忘不了我们在中国所受到的殷勤接待。我们希望，在你访问巴基斯坦期间，我们可以在某种程度上表示酬谢，并且向你表达我们对你和人民中国的崇高的敬意。”
    接着，周恩来总理发表了讲话。（全文见第一版）
    苏拉瓦底总理介绍了内阁的阁员、政府高级官员、高级军官、各国外交使节、巴中友好协会领导人员和各界知名人士同周恩来总理、贺龙副总理见面。
    巴基斯坦总统的军事秘书代表总统前来欢迎。当巴基斯坦总理陪同中国贵宾会见欢迎的人群的时候，机场上发出一阵又一阵的热情的欢呼，花瓣像雪片一样落到中国总理和副总理的身上，许多儿童和欢迎的人们向他们献了花环，欢迎的人群当中有大学生和戴着漂亮的帽子、拿着各色花伞的女学生，他们带来了乐队和笛子，高兴地演奏起来表示欢迎。人群中放出了成百个气球和一群群的鸽子。许多人站在机场主要建筑物的顶上和公共汽车的顶上向客人们欢呼。
    数以十万计的市民站在从飞机场到市内的道路两旁欢迎中国客人们。汽车愈接近市中心区，人群就愈拥挤。当汽车驶过的时候，他们都挥手鼓掌。这一大队汽车在身穿红色制服手执长枪的骑兵卫队的护卫下驶入总统府，中国政府领导人员在访问期间将住在这里。
    周恩来总理和贺龙副总理是应巴基斯坦政府的邀请来巴基斯坦伊斯兰共和国作为期十天的友好访问的。巴基斯坦驻中国大使阿哈默德、巴基斯坦外交部代理礼宾司长特雅布吉和中国驻巴基斯坦大使耿飚曾经在19日前往仰光迎接周恩来总理和他的同行者，他们陪同周总理一行到达卡拉奇。
