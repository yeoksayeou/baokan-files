　　Build Cities Through Thrift and Hard Work
    (Our newspaper reports) The Ministry of Urban Construction convened a conference on urban construction work from November 23rd to December 5th, focusing on examining and criticizing subjectivism in urban construction work, and clarifying the policy of building cities through thrift and hard work in urban construction work.

    The meeting unanimously agreed that in all aspects of urban construction work, whether it is urban planning, the construction and management of public utilities, or the design and construction of civil buildings, we must oppose subjectivism, advocate starting from reality, conduct practical investigations and research into the specific conditions and characteristics of each city, as well as the specific requirements of each relevant construction unit, and use this as a basis to specifically solve various problems in urban planning and urban construction.

    The meeting believes that the principle of building cities through thrift and hard work must be implemented in urban construction work. Investment in urban construction should appropriately consider general needs in terms of regions and projects, but there must be a focus in order to solve major problems and gradually carry out construction. Urban planning, architectural design, construction, and management should all be carefully calculated, paying attention to conservation, so as to most effectively use construction funds.

    More than 470 people attended the meeting, including heads of urban construction departments from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, heads of Party committees and municipal people's committees from some cities, as well as representatives from relevant central departments and urban construction majors from universities and colleges.

    本报讯　城市建设部于11月23日至12月5日召开了城市建设工作会议，着重检查和批判了城市建设工作中的主观主义，明确了城市建设工作中的勤俭建设方针。
    会议一致认为，在城市建设的各项工作中，不论是城市规划、公用事业的建设和管理、民用建筑的设计和施工等等，都必须反对主观主义，提倡从实际出发，对每一个城市的具体情况、具体特点以及各个有关建设单位的具体要求，进行切实的调查研究，据以具体的解决城市规划和城市建设中的各种问题。
    会议认为，城市建设工作必须贯彻勤俭建设的方针。城市建设投资在地区上和项目上要适当照顾一般，但必须有重点，以便解决主要问题，逐步进行建设。城市规划、建筑设计、施工和管理，都应当精打细算，注意节约，做到最有效地使用建设资金。
