    Absurd Analogy
    At a cadre meeting, Wu Tong, the former director of the Chongwen District Tax Bureau in Beijing, openly said to some people with historical stains or shortcomings: "You are like black cloth, which cannot be dyed into any other color, and it is fundamentally impossible to turn white. Party members are different; although they have shortcomings, they are white and can be dyed red, green, or black."
    This analogy is naturally absurd, but one can smell a sense of sectarianism from it. (Wang Yunsheng)

    荒唐的比喻
    在一次干部大会上，前任北京市崇文区税务分局局长吴铜公然地对一些有历史污点或有缺点的群众说：“你们好比黑布，怎样染也染不成别的颜色了，要变白，根本就不可能。党员不同，他们虽有缺点，但却是白的，可以染红、染绿或染黑的。”
    这个比喻自然是荒唐的，但人们可以从这里嗅到一种宗派主义的味道。（王芸生）
