Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 3rd: The Delhi Municipal Committee held a welcoming rally for the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni at Ramlila Square on the evening of December 2nd, with the participation of 40,000 citizens.

As the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni approached Ramlila Square, large crowds stood on both sides of the two-mile-long road to welcome them. Triumphal arches were erected on the road, with Indian and Chinese national flags and yellow Buddhist flags hanging, and colored light bulbs decorating the trees were brightly lit. The sides of the road leading to the podium were lined with beautifully decorated Indian pottery jars, with burning spices emitting fragrance. Pictures illustrating the life of Sakyamuni were hung around the podium.

When the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni arrived at Ramlila Square, they were welcomed by Lu. Na. Aggarawal, Chairman of the Delhi Municipal Committee, and were adorned with large garlands. As they ascended the podium accompanied by Prime Minister Nehru, they were cheered by citizens waving Indian national flags and yellow Buddhist flags. Five girls with long hair dressed in white sang a welcome song in a Buddhist tune.

The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni spoke at the meeting.

　　The Dalai Lama said:
　　"The essence of Sakyamuni's teachings
  is to liberate all living beings from suffering, and its
  purpose is to achieve peace and happiness."

The Dalai Lama said: "This is my first visit to India, and I must express my deep gratitude to the Indian government and people for the warm welcome given to me in Delhi." The Dalai Lama said that Sakyamuni had never been to Tibet. But the people in Tibet who accepted his teachings were so numerous that it was as if he had personally preached there, and his teachings are still alive in the hearts of the Tibetan people. He said that the essence of Sakyamuni's teachings is to liberate all living beings from suffering, and its purpose is to achieve peace and happiness. The Indian government and people have not only shown that they fully follow Sakyamuni's teachings, but also put this teaching into practice with actions that are consistently striving to maintain world peace. We are very willing to do our best to follow this noble example. Finally, the Dalai Lama expressed his prayers for the happiness and prosperity of the Indian people.

　　Panchen Erdeni said:
　　"If we comprehend and practice the Buddha's
  teachings, we can establish lasting world
  peace, so that the world in which we live
  progresses and prospers."

When Panchen Erdeni spoke at the welcoming rally, he expressed his sincere gratitude for being invited to participate in this grand public gathering. He said: Thanks to the benevolent wishes and constant struggles of the great leader of India, Gandhi, and his comrades, India has achieved independence. India has not only achieved freedom, but also demonstrated the fruits of independence through the massive development plans completed by the great efforts of its people. I warmly commend the great tasks you have completed so far and are currently completing.

He talked about how Buddhists should always remember the Buddha's teachings of benevolence and compassion. He said: We must also understand the law of cause and effect, so that we can distinguish between right and wrong. If we comprehend and practice his teachings, we can establish lasting world peace, so that the world in which we live progresses and prospers.

Panchen Erdeni said: "The Panchsheel Five Principles announced by India and China have laid the cornerstone for a new friendship between the two countries, which is of great significance to all of us. Now our responsibility is to strictly abide by it." He finally wished the friendship between India and China would last forever.

Prime Minister Nehru said in his speech that India had welcomed so many dignitaries, but the distinguished guests at today's welcome meeting were different from all the others. They are neither kings nor politicians, but they occupy a very high position.

Nehru said that in the world, there is so much talk of peace, but how much tension still exists. For example, on the one hand, we have personally witnessed the advance of armies, the clanging of weapons, and the clamor of armed forces, while on the other hand, the Buddha's teachings—an ancient revelation that has existed in our country for two thousand five hundred years—still influence our thinking.

Nehru said that he was very happy that in this urgent year in the world, the Buddha's teachings were also becoming popular again, and that they could personally celebrate the revival of the Buddha in India.

Before they gave their speeches, the Chairman of the Municipal Committee, on behalf of the citizens of Delhi, expressed a cordial welcome to the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni. He said that the connection established by the Buddha's teachings between India and China has been maintained, and that today, this connection is stronger than it has been for thousands of years. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni also accepted scrolls bound in red silk with citizens' greetings written on them, as well as carpets and other handicrafts as gifts. They also signed the Delhi City Guest Register.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 3rd: Indian President Dr. Rajendra Prasad held a banquet at the Presidential Palace on December 2nd to entertain the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni. All members of the two delegations accompanying the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni on their visit to India also attended the banquet.

　　德里四万市民举行盛大集会
　　欢迎达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼
　　普拉沙德总统举行宴会招待他们
    新华社新德里3日电　德里市政委员会12月2日晚间在拉姆利拉广场为达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼举行了有四万市民参加的欢迎大会。
    当达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼走向拉姆利拉广场的时候，大群的人站在二英里长的道路两旁欢迎他们。马路上竖立着欢迎牌坊、悬挂着印度和中国的国旗以及黄色的佛教旗帜，装饰在树上的彩色灯泡在大放光明。通往主席台的路两旁排列着装饰精美的印度陶瓶，瓶上烧燃着的香料放出芳香。在主席台的周围挂着说明释迦牟尼生平的图片。
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼到达拉姆利拉广场的时候，受到德里市政委员会主席鲁·纳·阿加瓦尔的欢迎，并且被戴上了很大的花环。当他们在尼赫鲁总理的陪同下登上主席台的时候，他们受到挥舞着印度的国旗和黄色的佛教旗帜的市民的欢呼。梳着长发穿着白衣的五个姑娘用佛教的调子唱起了欢迎歌。
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在会上讲了话。
      达赖喇嘛说：
      “释迦牟尼的教诲的本质
  就是使一切生灵解脱痛苦，其
  目的就是要达到和平和幸福。”
    达赖喇嘛说：“这是我第一次访问印度，我必须对印度政府和人民在德里给予我的热烈欢迎表示深切感谢。”达赖喇嘛说，释迦牟尼从来没有到过西藏。但是在西藏接受他的教诲的人是如此之广，就好像他曾经亲自到那里传过教一样，他的教诲现在仍然活在西藏人的心里。他说，释迦牟尼的教诲的本质就是使一切生灵解脱痛苦，其目的就是要达到和平和幸福。印度政府和人民不仅表明十分遵循释迦牟尼的教诲，并且还以一致为维持世界和平而斗争的行动来实行这个教诲。我们很愿尽力追随这个高尚的榜样。最后，达赖喇嘛表示祝祷印度人民的幸福和繁荣。
    班禅额尔德尼说：
        “如果我们领悟和实践佛
  祖的教义，我们就能够建立世
  界持久和平，使得我们生活的
  世界进步、繁荣。”
    班禅额尔德尼在欢迎会上讲话时对被邀请参加这个盛大的公众集会表示真诚的感谢。他说：由于印度的伟大领袖甘地和他的同志们的仁慈的愿望和不断斗争的结果，印度取得了独立。印度不仅取得了自由，而且通过它的人民的巨大努力所完成的庞大发展计划也表明了独立的成果。我热烈地赞许你们迄今所完成的和目前正在完成的伟大任务。
    他谈到佛教徒应当永远记住佛祖宣扬仁爱和慈悲的启示。他说：我们也必须了解因果的规律，这样我们才能够辨别是非。如果我们领悟和实践他的教义，我们就能够建立世界持久和平，使得我们生活的世界进步、繁荣。
    班禅额尔德尼说：“印度和中国所宣布的潘查希拉五原则为两国之间新的友谊奠定了基石，它对我们大家都有重大的意义。现在我们的责任就是严格地遵守它。”他最后祝印度和中国之间的友谊长存。
    尼赫鲁总理在会上讲话的时候说，印度曾经欢迎过那么多的显要人物，但是，今天欢迎会上的贵宾和其他人都不同。他们既不是国王也不是政治家，但是他们却占有很高的地位。
    尼赫鲁说，在世界上，有那么多的和平谈论，可是还存在着多少的紧张局势。例如，我们一方面亲眼看到了军队的进军、武器的叮噹声和武装力量的吵嚷，而另一方面，佛祖的启示——在我们的国家中存在了二千五百年的古老的启示——仍然在影响着我们的思想。
    尼赫鲁表示，他很高兴，在世界这个紧急年头里，佛祖的启示也重新流行了，而且他们可以亲自在印度庆祝佛祖的复活了。
    在他们发表演说以前，市政委员会主席代表德里的公民向达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼表示了殷切的欢迎。他说，佛祖的启示在印中两国之间建立的联系一直保持下来，而且在今天，这种联系比数千年来更为牢固了。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼还接受了上面写着市民祝辞的用红绸子裱的卷轴，以及地毯和其他工艺品等礼物。他们还在德里市的来客题名簿上签了名。
    新华社新德里3日电　印度总统拉金德拉·普拉沙德博士12月2日在总统府设宴招待达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼。陪同达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼到印度访问的两个代表团的全体团员也出席了宴会。
