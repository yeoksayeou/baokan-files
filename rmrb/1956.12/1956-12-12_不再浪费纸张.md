    No More Wasting Paper
    A letter from Anhui Culture Daily: The article "Running a Newspaper Means Preparing for Waste" published in the People's Daily on November 13th was a correct criticism of us, and we have conducted a review. We are determined to correct our mistakes, and since August we have been printing according to the actual established number. We also plan to bind and sell the extra copies printed in the past. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the readers for their criticism.

专栏：对批评的反应

    不再浪费纸张
    安徽文化报来信：11月13日人民日报所登的“办报就是准备浪费的”一文对我们的批评是正确的，我们进行了检查。并坚决改正自己的错误，自8月份我们就依照了实定数量付印；过去多印的份数也准备订成合订本出售。我们对读者的批评表示衷心感谢。
