Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: Tel Aviv dispatch: Walter Eytan, Director-General of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, stated in a speech broadcast on Israeli radio on the 9th that Israel is unwilling to allow Egypt to recover the Sinai Peninsula. He said that allowing Egypt to occupy the Sinai Peninsula is unimaginable.

He said that the best solution would be for Israel and Egypt to sign a peace treaty to eliminate all past disputes.

According to a United Press report, the Israeli cabinet met on the 9th to discuss a statement made by United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to Israel. According to Israeli Foreign Ministry sources, Hammarskjöld said in the statement that he could not guarantee that Egyptian troops would not enter the Sinai Peninsula because the United Nations General Assembly had not authorized him to deal with such issues.

News reports say that the Commander of the United Nations Emergency Force, Burns, has requested another meeting with the Chief of Staff of the Israeli Armed Forces, Moshe Dayan, to decide on the date for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Sinai Peninsula.

Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: Cairo dispatch: According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio on the 9th, the commander of the Yugoslav troops participating in the United Nations Emergency Force has suggested a sea landing in the Gaza area because of difficulties encountered in proceeding to the Gaza area by land.

It was previously reported that Yugoslav troops encountered obstacles such as landmines laid by Israeli troops after entering the Sinai Peninsula.

    以色列叫嚣不让埃及收复西奈半岛
    南斯拉夫部队司令建议从加沙海上登陆
    新华社10日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列外交部办公厅主任华尔特·埃丹9日在以色列电台发表的演说中表示，以色列不愿意让埃及收复西奈半岛。他说，让埃及占领西奈半岛是不可想像的。
    他说，最好的解决办法是以色列同埃及签订一项和约来消除过去的一切纠纷。
    据合众社报道，以色列内阁在9日开会讨论联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德给以色列的一个声明。据以色列外交部人士透露，哈马舍尔德在这个声明中说，他不能保证不让埃及军队进入西奈半岛，因为联合国大会没有授权他处理这类的问题。
    消息说，联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯已经要求同以色列武装部队总参谋长摩西·达扬再举行一次会议来决定以色列军队撤离西奈半岛的日期。
    新华社10日讯　开罗消息：据开罗电台9日广播，参加联合国紧急部队的南斯拉夫部队司令已经建议在加沙地区进行海上登陆，因为从陆路前往加沙地区遇到了困难。
    前已报道，南斯拉夫部队在进入西奈半岛后碰到了以色列军队布下的地雷等障碍。
