Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th (Reporter Chen Xiaojiang): The state-owned commercial departments of Xi'an City have exceeded this year's plan for saving commodity circulation costs ahead of schedule. As of the end of November, eighteen state-owned commercial specialized companies in the city had saved a total of 1,126,000 yuan in this expense, exceeding the original plan by 13.2%. Among them, eight companies including textiles, coal and construction, cultural goods, general merchandise, and food have exceeded the original savings plan by more than 10%.

At the beginning of this year, state-owned commercial companies in Xi'an City mobilized employees to discuss and formulate commodity circulation cost savings plans for their respective systems. Some companies also established specific implementation plans on a quarterly and monthly basis. Based on their business scope and addressing key issues in expenses, they identified the main savings projects for their units. In companies with larger commodity transportation volumes such as coal construction and timber, improved loading methods and the implementation of whole-vehicle and whole-stack delivery methods, thanks to the efforts of employees, reduced transportation and handling costs. The "technical loading" method implemented by the timber company alone saved more than 45,000 yuan in freight. Some specialized companies promoted "container transportation" in the third quarter of this year, reducing freight rates by about 70% compared to less-than-truckload transportation. The city's state-owned commercial system's freight expenses in the third quarter of this year were only equivalent to 44.6% of the same period last year. Regarding the utilization of old packaging materials, employees of various companies also actively sought solutions, repaired and modified, and tried to use existing packaging as much as possible. Within nine months, the city's state-owned commercial system saved more than 150,000 yuan in packaging costs. The warehouses of various commercial companies also implemented zoning, classification, and cargo location numbering methods, strengthening commodity storage and inspection, enabling timely processing of many easily broken and spoiled commodities, and reducing commodity losses. The city's five companies involved in chemical raw materials, hardware, medicine, timber, and factory and construction site supplies, due to active sales promotion and the resulting over-fulfillment of sales targets, accelerated capital turnover, saving more than 100,000 yuan in interest.

Currently, the Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Commerce is convening meetings of directors of state-owned commercial outlets and responsible persons of joint state-private shops to further implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. Companies with bloated organizations and excessive personnel will be effectively streamlined to reinforce lower-level retail units.

    西安市国营商业职工发挥积极性
    超额完成节约商品流转费用计划
    十八个专业公司节约这项费用一百一十二万多元
    新华社西安9日电　新华社记者陈小江报道：西安市国营商业部门提前超额完成今年节约商品流转费用的计划。截至11月底，全市十八个国营商业专业公司已节约这项费用总额达一百一十二万六千余元，超过原订计划13.2％。其中纺织品、煤业建筑、文化用品、百货、食品等八个公司都超过原节约计划的10％以上。
    今年年初，西安市各国营商业公司就发动职工群众讨论和制定了本系统的商品流转费用节约计划，有的公司还按季按月定出具体执行计划。他们根据业务范围，针对费用中的关键问题，确定了本单位的主要节约项目。在商品运载量较大的煤建、木材等公司，在职工的努力下改进了装载方法、实行整车整堆拨货办法后，减少了运输和搬运费用，仅木材公司实行的“技术装载”办法，就节省了四万五千多元的运费。部分专业公司在今年第三季度推广“集装箱运输法”，使运费率较零担运输时降低70％左右。全市国营商业系统在今年第三季度运费仅相当于去年同期的44.6％。在利用旧包装材料上，各公司职工也积极地找窍门、修补改装并尽量利用旧有包装，九个月内全市国营商业系统即节省包装费用十五万多元。各商业公司仓库还实行了分区、分类、货位编号办法，加强了商品的保管和检验工作，使许多容易破碎、霉坏的商品得到及时的处理，减少了商品损耗。市化工原料、五金、医药、木材、工厂、工地供应等五个公司，由于积极推销，超额完成销售任务的结果，使资金周转加快，节省利息已达十万元以上。
    目前，西安市商业局正分别召集全市各国营商业门市部主任、公私合营商店负责人举行会议，进一步贯彻增产节约精神，对部分机构臃肿、人员较多的公司，将予确实的精减，以充实下层门市单位。
