Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 6th: According to the Hungarian News Agency, the Hungarian Supply Committee held a reporting meeting on December 5th with the participation of staff members from various committees of provinces and commercial systems.

　　The Director of the Supply Committee, Rezső Nyers, delivered a report at the meeting. He said that due to a lack of power and transportation difficulties, commerce and the food industry are facing great difficulties. One of the primary conditions for completing commercial tasks is to improve railway transportation. Currently, the transportation volume of Hungarian railways is only 15 to 20 percent of the usual amount.

　　Nyers also said that due to a lack of power, several light industrial factories will have to temporarily halt production.

　　Supply Committee member János Tausz said in his report that, to date, 48,000 tons of food and 28,000 tons of industrial products have been shipped from abroad.

　　Foreign aid and imports can guarantee the supply of bread and flour to residents. The supply of meat and lard is also satisfactory, but the storage of salt is insufficient, and 240 railcars of onions need to be purchased from abroad. He said that the commercial and industrial sectors are preparing for Christmas. The supply of chickens, ducks, and milk has increased compared to the same period last year, and a large quantity of fish will be sold.

　　Tausz pointed out that due to a 50% reduction in the inventory of fabrics and shoes, and because the operating rate of light industrial factories is only 30% to 35%, it is quite difficult to meet the needs of residents. He said that in order to improve the situation, inventories prepared for export will be sold domestically. We will request that foreign countries provide some clothing in their aid supplies. To date, Hungary has received thirty-three railcars of shoes shipped from abroad.

　　匈牙利物资供应情况逐步改善
    新华社布达佩斯6日电　据匈牙利通讯社报道：匈牙利供应委员会在12月5日举行了一次有各省和商业系统的各个委员会工作人员参加的报告会。
    供应委员会主任雷热·?尔什在会上作了报告。他说：由于缺乏动力和运输上的困难，商业和食品工业都面临着很大的困难。完成商业任务的首要条件之一就是改善铁路运输。现在，匈牙利铁路的运输量只及往常的百分之十五至二十。
    ?尔什还说：由于缺乏动力，好几个轻工业工厂将不得不暂时停止生产。
    供应委员会委员亚诺什·塔乌斯在报告中说，到目前为止，从国外运来了四万八千吨的食品和二万八千吨的工业产品。
    外国的援助和进口可以保证居民的面包和面粉供应。肉类和猪油供应也令人满意，但是，食盐的储存量不够，还要向国外购买二百四十车皮的洋葱。他说，商业和工业部门都在为圣诞节作准备。鸡鸭等和牛奶的供应比去年同期的供应增加了，将要出售大量的鱼。
    塔乌斯指出，由于布匹和鞋子的存货减少了50％，而且由于轻工业工厂的开工率只达30％到35％，满足居民的需要是有相当的困难的。他说，为了改善情况，准备出口的存货将在国内销售。我们将要求外国在援助物资中供给一部分衣服。到目前为止，匈牙利已经收到三十三个车皮国外运来的鞋子。
