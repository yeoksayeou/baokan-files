    Ceramic Radiators

    Among the new products recently added to the Northeast Industrial Exhibition Hall, a dazzling white radiator made of ceramic has attracted the attention of visitors, especially housewives and hospital staff.

    The Shenyang Ceramic Factory, which manufactures this radiator, can produce 400,000 units annually according to its production capacity, saving the country 3,000 tons of cast iron.

    The ceramic radiator was successfully trial-produced in October this year through the cooperation of the Liaoning Provincial Urban Design Institute and the Shenyang Ceramic Factory. It has four specifications, including louvered and non-louvered types. According to physical performance test results, the heating area is similar to that of iron radiators, but the heat dissipation is slower than that of iron, the heat retention time is longer, and the corrosion resistance is stronger than that of iron. It is suitable for offices, hospitals, schools, and residences.

    陶磁暖气片
    在东北工业陈列馆近日增添的新产品中，有一种洁白耀眼的用陶磁制成的暖气片，引起了参观者特别是家庭主妇和医院工作人员的注意。
    制造这种暖气片的沈阳陶磁厂，按照生产能力，每年可制造四十万片，能为国家节省三千吨铸铁。
    陶磁暖气片是辽宁省城市设计院和沈阳陶磁厂在今年10月份合作试制成功的。计有透笼式、不透笼式等四种规格，根据物理性能试验结果，发热面积和铁制暖气片相近，而散热却比铁制的慢，保温时间较长，耐腐力也比铁制的强。它适用于办公室、医院、学校和住宅。
