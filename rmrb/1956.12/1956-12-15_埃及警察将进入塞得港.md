    Egyptian Police to Enter Port Said
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 14th: According to a report by the Middle East News Agency on the 13th, Egyptian police will enter Port Said within the next 48 hours.
    When speaking to reporters on the morning of the 13th about the clearing of the Suez Canal, Younis, the Director of the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority, said: "It is currently difficult to say how long it will take to clear the canal, because the extent of damage to the canal cannot be estimated until the enemy has withdrawn." He said that the Suez Canal Authority will clear the canal with the assistance of the United Nations. He also pointed out: "The Egyptian Suez Canal Authority is technically capable of clearing the canal."
