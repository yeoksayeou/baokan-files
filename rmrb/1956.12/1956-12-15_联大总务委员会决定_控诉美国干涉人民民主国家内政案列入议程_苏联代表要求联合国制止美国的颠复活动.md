Xinhua News Agency, December 14th Dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Committee held a meeting on December 13th to discuss the inclusion of the item proposed by the Soviet delegation regarding "U.S. Interference in the Internal Affairs of People's Democratic Countries and Its Subversive Activities Against These Countries" on the agenda of the General Assembly. The wording of this item was slightly modified at the suggestion of Denmark and other countries, and with the agreement of the Soviet Union. The revised title of the proposal is: "Complaint by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics against the United States of America regarding Interference in the Internal Affairs of Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union, and its Subversive Activities against these countries."

The meeting decided, without opposition from Western countries, to include this item on the agenda of the General Assembly. Soviet Representative Kuznetsov, in his speech during the discussion, pointed out that the United States has a long history of interfering in the internal affairs of people's democratic countries. Since the Sixth and Seventh Sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the destructive activities of the United States have not only not ceased, but have intensified.

Last spring, the United States elaborately formulated a new plan of destructive activities called the "Plan for Political Offensive Against World Communism." This plan stipulates the organization, support, and supply of armed counter-revolutionary bandits in people's democratic countries, using these armed bandits to organize rebellions. Various kinds of criminals, traitors to their homelands, and counter-revolutionaries who fled from people's democratic countries have played a significant role in realizing this plan. Kuznetsov said that the Hungarian incident was the result of this kind of interference by the United States.

Kuznetsov concluded by saying that the activities of the United States in interfering in the internal affairs of other countries have further strained the international atmosphere and constitute a serious threat to international peace and security. Under these circumstances, the responsibility of the United Nations is to take urgent measures to stop the United States from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and to stop its subversive activities against other countries. Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that the United Nations must discuss the issue of U.S. interference in the internal affairs of people's democratic countries and the issue of its destructive activities against these countries at this meeting.

The Czechoslovak representative supported the Soviet proposal.

U.S. Representative Wadsworth tried his best to defend the U.S.'s behavior of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and unscrupulously slandered the Eastern European people's democratic countries. However, he said that he did not object to discussing this issue because the United States wanted to explain "the whole truth" to the United Nations.

Representatives from Britain, France, Pakistan, and Peru echoed the views of the United States and stated that they did not object to including the item proposed by the Soviet Union on the agenda.

The General Committee then decided by a majority vote to include this item on the agenda of the General Assembly.

The meeting then discussed where to discuss this item. The Soviet Union advocated that it be discussed by the General Assembly, while Western countries opposed it. With the support of Western countries, the meeting passed a suggestion from the Danish representative to hand this item over to the Special Political Committee of the General Assembly for discussion.

    联大总务委员会决定
    控诉美国干涉人民民主国家内政案列入议程
    苏联代表要求联合国制止美国的颠复活动
    据新华社14日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会总务委员会12月13日举行会议，讨论把苏联代表团提出的关于“美国对人民民主国家内政的干涉和它对这些国家的颠覆活动”这个项目列入大会议程的问题。这个项目的措词在丹麦等国家的建议和苏联的同意下作了一些修改，修改后的提案名称是：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟控诉美利坚合众国对阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚和苏联的内政的干涉和它对这些国家的颠覆活动。”
    会议在西方国家不表示反对的情况下，决定把这个项目列入大会议程。苏联代表库兹涅佐夫在讨论时发言指出，美国干涉人民民主国家的内政具有长久的历史。联合国大会第六届会议和第七届会议以来，美国的破坏活动不仅没有停止，反而变本加厉了。
    去年春天，美国详细地制定了一个新的破坏活动计划，叫做“对世界共产主义实行政治进攻计划”。这个计划规定组织、支持和供应人民民主国家里的武装反革命匪徒。利用这些武装匪徒来组织叛乱。形形色色的罪犯、祖国叛徒和从人民民主国家中逃亡出来的反革命分子在实现这个计划方面起了重大作用。库兹涅佐夫说，匈牙利事件就是美国这种干涉行为的结果。
    库兹涅佐夫最后说，美国干涉其他国家内政的活动已经使国际气氛更为紧张，并且构成了对国际和平和安全的严重威胁。在这样情况下，联合国的责任就是采取紧急措施来制止美国干涉其他国家内政，制止它对其他国家进行颠覆活动。因此，苏联代表团认为联合国必须在这次会议上讨论美国干涉人民民主国家内政的问题和关于它对这些国家的破坏活动的问题。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表支持苏联的建议。
    美国代表华兹渥斯竭力为美国干涉他国内政的行为辩护，并且大肆污蔑东欧人民民主国家。不过他说，他不反对讨论这个问题，因为美国要向联合国说明“全部真相”。
    英国、法国、巴基斯坦和秘鲁等国家的代表附和美国的意见，并且表示不反对把苏联提出的项目列入议程。
    总务委员会接着以多数票决定把这个项目列入大会议程。
    会议接着讨论在那里讨论这个项目的问题。苏联主张由大会讨论，西方国家表示反对。在西方国家支持下，会议通过了丹麦代表的一项建议，把这个项目交给大会的特别政治委员会讨论。
