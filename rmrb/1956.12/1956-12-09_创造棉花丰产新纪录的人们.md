　　The People Who Created New Cotton Production Records

    The Xue Zhanchun group of the 3rd company of a certain unit of the Agricultural Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, planted 100 mu of Soviet "611" variety cotton this year at the Anjihai Farm in the Manas River Basin reclamation area. According to the final calculation results, the average actual yield of seed cotton was 669.65 jin per mu. Among them, 3.84 mu of cotton fields achieved high yields, with an average actual yield of 1,686.46 jin per mu, which is 293.6 jin higher than the national cotton high-yield record created last year by the cotton planting platoon led by Liu Xuefo, a cotton planting expert in the Xinjiang Military Region.

    The new record of the Xue Zhanchun group immediately attracted the attention of people in the reclamation area. In addition to responsible cadres from the reclamation area troops personally going to Anjihai Farm to congratulate them, brother farms quickly sent representatives to inquire about their experiences, preparing to take them back and promote them. Photographers from the "August 1st" Film Studio of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who were filming a cotton high-yield film in the Manas River Basin, also rushed to capture the Xue Zhanchun group and the high-yield cotton fields on film.

    This group has a total of four people. The group leader, Xue Zhanchun, is a Communist Party member and has been awarded four merits in the production labor of building the border region over the years. He and group members Yang Laisheng, Xie Fuen, and Wang Shixing have all had more than four years of cotton planting experience in the reclamation area, but in the past, the yield of cotton was not very high. Last year, after hearing the news that the Liu Xuefo platoon of a brother farm had achieved high yields, the entire group was determined to learn from them, believing that what the Liu Xuefo platoon could do, they would definitely be able to do, and strive to break the Liu Xuefo platoon's record and produce more cotton for the country.

    Their work to strive for high yields began last autumn when plowing and harrowing the land. For nearly a year, they have used comprehensive technical measures for planting cotton. In the spring, when the snow still covered the fields, they thought that among the selected high-yield lands, there were several mu of hard soil. If these lands were watered too much, they would turn into mud, and after drying, they would be as hard as adobe, making it very difficult for cotton to grow. Therefore, before spring plowing began, they used sleds and baskets to transport sand from nearby in the wind and snow, and padded the sticky soil with more than three inches of sand, finally making the soil more suitable for growing cotton. In order to shorten the sowing period, sowing was carried out at night with machines and lanterns, so there were inevitably omissions in sowing. The Xue Zhanchun group calculated carefully and determined that it was impossible to have full seedlings, so they decided to quickly re-sow. Unfortunately, there was insufficient water in the re-sown land. If the melted snow water in early spring was poured, it would lower the soil temperature and affect emergence. To this end, they dug a load of wet sand from nearby canals and ditches, and covered it on top during re-sowing, finally overcoming the difficulties. When the cotton seedlings were about to emerge, there was suddenly a rain, which formed a hard crust on the surface of the cotton fields. In order to help the cotton seedlings emerge smoothly, they broke the ground with their hands and loosened the soil, and the cotton seedlings quickly emerged completely. After thinning and setting seedlings, the 100 mu of cotton fields had an average of more than 6,500 cotton plants per mu. The high-yield areas had an average of more than 7,200 plants per mu, about 2,000 more plants than ordinary large fields. This laid the foundation for high yields.

    In the previous period, the weather was uncertain, and the relatively cold climate hindered the normal development of seedlings. With the help of the company cadres and technicians, Xue Zhanchun and others cultivated the cotton fields 15 times between the rows and between the plants in order to maintain the soil temperature, eliminate the soil hardening after watering, and remove weeds. After the lush cotton branches and leaves grew up, the horse-drawn cultivators could not enter the fields for cultivation, so they cultivated with hoes. When cultivating, they always retreated backwards so that their legs could push open the branches and leaves to avoid damage to the cotton plants. Therefore, until the cotton matured, the soil in the cotton fields always remained loose. In addition, they also top-dressed chemical fertilizers and human manure three to four times, and watered seven times using furrow irrigation. When doing these tasks, they often sacrificed their nap time, and sometimes even worked until late at night.

    When the cotton plants were growing vigorously, the leaves of the cotton plants in a few pieces of land were always drooping listlessly. It turned out that these places were uneven, and the channel water flowed quickly to the low-lying areas. At first glance, the ground was wet, but the high-lying areas were still suffering from drought because the penetration was not deep enough. To this end, they came up with another method, first loosening the furrow with a hoe, and then piling up small soil dams that could accumulate water to divert water to replenish it, so that those weak cotton plants also became strong. If the cotton plants on the edge of the ditch had their roots washed out by the water, they would always cover them with soil, and some would even tie them with hemp ropes to nearby cotton plants with stable roots so that they would not be blown down by the wind. If some cotton plants grew obliquely, they would also cut small sticks with forks from the forest to prop them up straight. They would focus on pruning and topping any cotton plant that had enough cotton bolls to control its growth. If a cotton boll had a hole bitten open by insects, they would search on the surrounding cotton leaves until they caught the insect and killed it. Everyone even hung bright flashlights on their chests and sprinkled insecticide powder overnight, protecting more than 70% of the cotton bolls so that they could all crack open and spit out lint.

    Because of their diligent labor from beginning to end, they finally increased the unit area yield of cotton from the level of the Liu Xuefo platoon by a large margin.

　　创造棉花丰产新纪录的人们
　　新华社记者　汪波清
    中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队某部三连薛占春小组，今年在玛纳斯河流域垦区安集海农场种植了苏联“六一一”品种棉花一百亩。根据最后计算结果，平均每亩实收籽棉六百六十九点六五斤。其中有三亩八分四厘棉田获得高额丰产，平均每亩实收一千六百八十六点四六斤，比新疆军区植棉能手刘学佛领导的植棉排去年创造的全国棉花丰产纪录高出二百九十三点六斤。
    薛占春小组的新纪录立即引起垦区内人们的注意。除垦区部队负责干部亲往安集海农场祝贺外，兄弟农场很快派来代表询问经验，准备带回去推广。正在玛纳斯河流域拍摄棉花丰产影片的中国人民解放军总政治部“八一”电影制片厂的摄影师，也赶来把薛占春小组人员和丰产棉田摄入镜头。
    这个小组共有四人。组长薛占春是共产党员，在建设边疆的生产劳动中连年立过四次功。他和组员杨来生、谢富恩和王世兴，在垦区内都有四年以上的种棉花历史，但是过去棉花的产量不算很高。去年他们听到兄弟农场刘学佛排获得高额丰产的消息后，全组决心向他们学习，认为刘学佛排能做到的，他们也一定能够做到，并且争取突破刘学佛排的纪录，给国家生产更多的棉花。
    他们争取丰产的工作，在去年秋季翻地翻耙的时候就开始了。将近一年来，他们运用了种植棉花的综合技术措施。春天，当积雪还复盖着田野的时候，他们就想到在选定的丰产地当中，有几亩土质坚硬的土地，这些土地水浇多了会变成泥浆，晒干后坚硬得和土坯一样，棉花的生长十分困难。于是，他们趁春耕还没有开始，便在风雪中用爬犁和筐笼从附近运来了沙土，在粘土地上垫起三寸多厚，终于使土壤变得比较适宜于生长棉花。为了缩短播种期限，播种是打着灯笼在夜间用机器赶着进行的，所以难免有漏播的现象。薛占春小组算了细账，肯定不可能会有全苗，他们便决定赶紧补种。但不凑巧，补种地水分不足，如果补浇早春的化雪水就会使地温降低，影响出苗。为此，他们就从附近河渠间挖来一担湿沙，补种时把湿沙盖在上面，终于克服了困难。棉苗将要出土的时候，忽然下了一场雨，使棉田的表面结了一层硬皮。为了帮助棉苗顺利出土，他们用手扒破地皮，疏松了土壤，棉苗就很快出齐了。经过间苗、定苗以后，一百亩棉田平均每亩有六千五百多棵棉株。高额产地的棉株平均每亩有七千二百多株，比一般大田多出约两千株左右。这样就为丰产奠定了基础。
    前一时期，天气阴晴不定，气候较冷妨碍幼苗正常发育。薛占春等人在连队干部和技术人员的帮助下，为了保持地温，消灭浇水后土地的板结和除尽杂草，先后在棉花的行间和株间中耕了十五次。茂盛的棉花枝叶长起来以后，马拉中耕器不能进入田间耕作，他们就用锄头中耕，中耕时都是身体向后倒退着进行，以便两腿拨开枝叶，避免棉株损折。因此，一直到棉花成熟以后，棉田的土壤始终保持着疏松的状态。此外，他们还追施化学肥料和人肥等三次到四次，采用沟灌的方法浇水七次。在做这些工作的时候，他们常常牺牲了自己的午睡时间，有时甚至工作到深夜。
    正当棉株旺盛的时候，有几片地里的棉株叶子总是没生气地搭拉着。原来这些地方高低不平，渠水流向低处时流得快，粗一看地面是湿的，但高处因渗透不深，还是受了旱。为此，他们又想出办法，用锄头先把行沟挖松，并且堆起能够积水的小土坝，引水来补，使那些瘦弱的棉株也粗壮起来。如果渠边的棉株被水冲出了根，他们就随时培上土，有的还要用麻绳把它绑起来连在附近根子长得很稳实的棉株上，使它不被风吹倒。有的棉株长得倾斜了，也从树林中砍来带杈的细棍，把它扶正撑直。那一棵棉株结了足够的棉铃，就来重点整枝打顶，控制它的生长。那里有一个棉铃被虫咬开了孔，他们就在周围的棉叶上找寻，直到捉住虫弄死为止。大家甚至把打亮的手电筒挂在胸前，连夜撒杀虫药粉，保护了70％以上的棉铃都能裂绽吐絮。
    由于他们自始至终地勤奋劳动，终于把棉花单位面积的产量，从刘学佛排的水平上提高了一大步。
