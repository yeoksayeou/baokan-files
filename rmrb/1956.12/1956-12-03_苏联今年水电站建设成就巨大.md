Moscow, December 2nd (By our correspondent) - The construction of hydropower stations in the first year of the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan has achieved great success. Many hydropower stations have completed their 1956 construction plans ahead of schedule. The power generated by hydropower stations in 1956 increased by 1.8 times compared to 1955.

	The Kuibyshev Hydropower Station on the Volga River, with a generating capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts, officially started transmitting electricity on November 29th after the installation of its ninth generator. Since the first generator was installed on December 29th of last year, nine generators, each with a generating capacity of 105,000 kilowatts, have been installed and put into operation in eleven months. By November 20th, the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station had transmitted 1.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. The hydropower station builders plan to complete the installation of another generator ahead of schedule before the end of this year. A total of twenty generators will be installed at the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station, which is expected to be fully completed in 1957. In the past ten months, the hydropower station has completed another 21 million cubic meters of earthwork and poured nearly 1.5 million cubic meters of concrete.

	Construction workers at the Gorky Hydropower Station on the upper reaches of the Volga River installed the seventh generator in thirty-two days, setting a new installation record. The eighth generator will also be installed ahead of schedule before the end of the year.

	The Kama Hydropower Station, with generators installed inside the dam body, installed seven generators this year and is expected to install one more. The entire hydropower station was originally planned to have twenty-four generators, and now twenty-two have been installed and put into operation, with a generating capacity of 504,000 kilowatts, exceeding expectations. Since the first generator was put into operation, the hydropower station has supplied the Ural power transmission system with 2 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. The first hydropower station on the Angara River, the Irkutsk Hydropower Station, will have two generators starting to transmit electricity within the year. By the end of November, the hydropower station had completed more than 3 million cubic meters of earthwork and poured approximately 250,000 cubic meters of concrete. The first batch of buildings for the hydropower station has been built on the left bank of the Angara River, where eight generators will be placed.

	The Kairak-Kum Hydropower Station in the Tajik Republic will soon have two of its six generators starting to transmit electricity. After the hydropower station is completed, it will supply electricity to many areas in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and irrigate new land being reclaimed in the "wasteland."

	In addition, the Volvolin Hydropower Station in the Azerbaijan Republic, the Tekibuli Hydropower Station in the Georgian Republic, and the Arzni Hydropower Station in the Armenian Republic are all being constructed smoothly.

    苏联今年水电站建设成就巨大
    本报莫斯科2日电　苏联第六个五年计划第一年的水力发电站建设取得了很大成就。许多水电站提前完成了1956年度建设计划。1956年水电站的发电力比1955年增加一点八倍。
    发电力二百十万瓩的伏尔加河上的古比雪夫水电站，在11月29日第九部发电机安装完毕，正式送电。这个水电站自去年12月29日安装好第一部发电机以来十一个月中已有九部发电机先后装成送电，每部发电力是十万五千瓩。到11月20日古比雪夫水电站所输送出的电量已达十五亿度。水电站建设者们要在今年年底之前再超额完成一部发电机的安装工程。古比雪夫水电站总共将安装二十部发电机，预计在1957年将全部竣工。在今年十个多月中水电站又完成了二千一百万立方公尺土工，浇灌了将近一百五十万立方公尺混凝土。
    伏尔加河上游的高尔基水电站建筑工人，用了三十二天工夫安装好第七部发电机，创造了安装新纪录。第八部发电机也将提前在年底以前安装好。
    发电机装在堤身内部的卡马水电站，在今年安装了七部发电机。预计还要安装好一部。整个水电站原计划装二十四部发电机，现有二十二部装好送电，其发电力已达五十万四千瓩，超过预计。从第一部发电机送电以来，水电站已经供给乌拉尔输电系统二十亿度。安加拉河上第一个水电站——伊尔库茨克水电站年内将有两部发电机开始送电。到11月底，水电站完成了三百多万立方公尺土工和浇灌了约二十五万立方公尺混凝土。水电站第一批建筑物已在安加拉河左岸建起，那里将安放八部发电机。
    塔吉克共和国的卡以拉克—库姆水电站，六部发电机中最近将有二部开始送电。水电站建成后将供给乌兹别克斯坦和塔吉克斯坦许多电力并且灌溉“荒原”上被开垦着的新地。
    此外，阿塞拜疆共和国的沃尔沃林水电站、格鲁吉亚共和国的特基布里水电站，阿尔明尼亚共和国的阿尔兹尼水电站等都顺利地建设着。
