    One year ago today, December 25th, was a significant day in the friendly relations between the Chinese and German peoples. On this day a year ago, upon concluding its friendly visit to our country, the Government Delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, issued a joint statement in Beijing with the Government Delegation of our country, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, and signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic. These two important documents established the principles of "mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit" as the foundation of our bilateral relations, and expressed the common desire to strengthen and develop comprehensive friendly cooperation between our two countries. The signing of such a fully equal and mutually beneficial state treaty between China and the German Democratic Republic plays an important role in enhancing the unity between socialist countries and safeguarding world peace.
    In the past year, thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, we have recorded more encouraging facts of friendship in the history of our bilateral relations. Our economic cooperation has been further strengthened, which has helped promote the common upsurge of the economies of both countries. Our two countries have also made great progress in cultural exchanges and scientific cooperation. In addition, the exchange of various delegations, especially the participation of the Chinese Communist Party delegation headed by Comrade Kang Sheng in the Third Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party, and the participation of the German Socialist Unity Party delegation headed by Comrade Ulbricht in the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, is of great significance for promoting mutual understanding and fraternal friendship between the two peoples and the two parties.
    The joint statement issued by the two governments a year ago expressed a complete consensus on the international situation. The Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation also stipulates that "the two countries, in the spirit of sincere cooperation, shall participate in all international actions aimed at safeguarding world peace and the security of all peoples and conforming to the principles of the United Nations Charter." In the past year, our two countries have faithfully implemented the provisions of this treaty, and have made joint efforts to safeguard world peace and security. The process of easing the international situation has been hindered by the armed aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt and the rampant subversive and destructive activities of imperialism against Eastern European countries. Although the imperialist forces' aggression against Egypt and their subversive activities in Hungary have been defeated, they have not given up. They are plotting new acts of aggression in the Middle East. They are continuing to use the Hungarian incident to carry out anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and divisive activities against socialist countries around the world. At present, the rising tide of West German militarist forces under the support of imperialism, and the efforts of Western countries to strengthen the aggressive military blocs of the North Atlantic, the Near and Middle East, and Southeast Asia, pose new threats to the cause of peace in Europe and Asia and Africa. At the same time, those imperialist forces that are hostile to China and Democratic Germany are still trying to undermine the legitimate rights of these two countries in international affairs and prevent them from obtaining their due status in international organizations. The current situation requires China and the German Democratic Republic to further strengthen cooperation with each other and enhance fraternal unity with socialist countries led by the Soviet Union, and continue to fight together to defend world peace and the cause of socialist progress. We are pleased to see that the Government of the German Democratic Republic and the German Socialist Unity Party have expressed their firm support for the Hungarian people's struggle to defend their socialist achievements, maintained a high degree of vigilance against the imperialist conspiracies to undermine socialist countries and their mutual unity, and are doing their best to consolidate the workers' and peasants' regime in Democratic Germany and strengthen friendly cooperation with socialist countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. These facts demonstrate the firm position of the Party and people of the German Democratic Republic on Marxism-Leninism and the noble spirit of proletarian internationalism. This is a great encouragement to the Chinese people.
    The German Democratic Republic is our close brother and comrade-in-arms in the struggle for socialist progress. The Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed a year ago is a strong bond that has closely united the peoples of our two countries. The more this fraternal friendship and unity between our socialist countries is strengthened, the more guaranteed the consolidation and development of the socialist cause will be, and the more hopeless the imperialist enemies' attempts to hinder the advance of the socialist movement and undermine peace will be.

    中德友好条约一周年
    12月25日是中德两国人民友好关系中的一个意义重大的日子。一年前的今天，以格罗提渥总理为首的德意志民主共和国政府代表团在结束对我国的友好访问时，在北京同以周恩来总理为首的我国政府代表团发表了联合声明，签订了中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国友好合作条约。这两个重要的文件，确定了以“互相尊重主权、互不干涉内政和平等互利”的原则作为我们两国关系的基础，表示了加强和发展我们两国之间全面友好合作关系的共同愿望。中国和德意志民主共和国签订这样一个完全平等互利的国家条约，对于增进社会主义国家之间的团结和保障世界的和平有着重要的作用。
    在过去这一年里，由于双方的共同努力，我们已经为两国的关系史记载上了更多令人鼓舞的友谊的事实。我们两国的经济合作有了进一步的加强，这有助于促进两国经济的共同高涨。我们两国在文化交流和科学合作方面也有了很大发展。此外，各种代表团的往来，特别是以康生同志为首的中国共产党代表团的参加德国统一社会党第三次代表会议，和以乌布利希同志为首的德国统一社会党代表团的参加中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，对于促进两国人民和两国党之间的相互了解和兄弟友谊，具有十分重要的意义。
    两国政府在一年前发表的联合声明，对国际局势的见解表现了完全的一致。在中德友好合作条约中还规定：“两国本着真诚合作的精神，参加一切旨在保障世界和平和各国人民的安全并且符合联合国宪章原则的国际行动”。我们两国在过去一年中忠实地执行了这一条约的规定，一致为保障世界和平和安全作了共同的努力。由于英、法、以对埃及的武装侵略和帝国主义对东欧各国的猖狂的颠复破坏活动，国际局势趋向和缓的过程受到了阻挠。现在帝国主义势力对埃及的侵略和对匈牙利的颠复活动虽已经遭受失败，但是它们并没有死心。它们正在中东策划新的侵略阴谋。它们正继续利用匈牙利事件在世界范围内进行反苏反共和破坏社会主义国家团结的活动。目前，西德军国主义势力在帝国主义扶植下的日益抬头，西方国家竭力加强北大西洋、中近东和东南亚侵略性军事集团的努力，使欧洲和亚非地区的和平事业面临着新的威胁。同时，那些敌视中国和民主德国的帝国主义势力，也仍然在竭力企图破坏这两个国家在国际事务中的合法权利，阻挠它们在国际组织中取得应有的地位。目前的形势要求中国和德意志民主共和国在今天更进一步地加强相互之间的合作和增进同以苏联为首的社会主义各国的兄弟团结，继续为保卫世界和平和社会主义的进步事业而共同斗争。我们高兴地看到，德意志民主共和国政府和德国统一社会党对匈牙利人民保卫社会主义成果的斗争表示了坚决的支持，对帝国主义企图破坏社会主义国家及其相互团结的阴谋保持了高度的警惕，正在尽力巩固民主德国的工农政权，并在平等互利和互相尊重的基础上加强同社会主义各国的友好合作。这些事实表现了德意志民主共和国的党和人民对于马克思列宁主义的坚定立场和无产阶级国际主义的崇高精神。这对中国人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。
    德意志民主共和国是我们亲密的兄弟和争取社会主义进步事业斗争中的战友。一年前签订的中德友好合作条约是一根强有力的纽带，它已经把我们两国人民紧紧地团结在一起。我们社会主义国家之间的这种兄弟般的友谊和团结越是加强，社会主义事业的巩固和发展就越有保障，帝国主义敌人企图阻挠社会主义运动前进和破坏和平的阴谋也就越加无望。
