Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 5th: Restoration work on damaged houses and transportation facilities is underway in Budapest. In the drizzling winter weather, residents of the capital can be seen busily clearing rubble and tidying up ruins in the streets. A week ago, 24,000 construction workers participated in the restoration work, and this week the number has increased to 30,000. All expenses for the restoration work are entirely borne by the state. A large number of construction materials aided by the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries have been transported in.

The National Construction Committee has already begun work, and it plans to first repair buildings with the risk of collapse and houses that only require minor repairs this year. With the exception of a few houses, the original appearance can be fully restored within next year. As for the tram lines, they can be repaired within ten days. The East and West Railway Stations will also soon be fully repaired.

    争取在明年内全部恢复旧观
　　布达佩斯积极进行修复工作
    据新华社布达佩斯5日电　布达佩斯对被破坏的房屋和交通设备的修复工作正在进行。在细雨霏霏的冬日里，街头上可以看见首都的居民在紧张地打扫瓦砾和收拾颓垣。一个星期前，有两万四千个建筑工人参加修复工作，本星期已经增加到三万人。一切修复工作的费用完全由国家负担。苏联和各兄弟国家援助的大批建筑材料已经运到。
    国家修建委员会已经开始工作，它计划在今年内首先修复有倾坍危险的建筑物以及只需要轻微修理的房屋。除个别房屋外，明年内可以全部恢复旧观。至于电车线路在十天内就可以修好。东、西两火车站也很快就可以完全修好。
