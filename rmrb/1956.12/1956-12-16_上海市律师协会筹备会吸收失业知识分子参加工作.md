Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 15th. The Shanghai Lawyers Association Preparatory Committee recently absorbed fourteen unemployed intellectuals to participate in lawyer work. Before liberation, they had all worked as lawyers for many years. After liberation, they participated in political studies organized by the CPPCC, various democratic parties, and other units. They also have some correct understanding of the people's judicial system. For example, Wang Shuzhen has also served as a mediator for neighborhood residents. Recently, she was elected as a people's assessor. These people generally are familiar with some legal knowledge, have rich social experience, and are willing to be people's lawyers, contributing their share to the country's socialist construction.

According to their requirements, the Shanghai Lawyers Association Preparatory Committee will help them study the "Eighth National Congress" documents before they formally start working. Later, they will also help them study Marxist-Leninist theories on the state and law, as well as the Soviet and Chinese lawyer systems, in connection with reality. After a short period of study, they will be assigned to work in various legal advisory offices.

    上海市律师协会筹备会吸收失业知识分子参加工作
    新华社上海15日电　上海市律师协会筹备会最近吸收了十四名失业知识分子参加律师工作。他们在解放前都做过多年律师，解放以后曾参加过政协、各民主党派等单位组织的政治学习，对人民司法制度也有一些正确认识，其中如王淑贞还担任过里弄居民的调解工作，最近，她被选为人民陪审员。这些人一般都熟悉一些法律方面的常识，社会经验较丰富，愿意做一个人民律师，为国家的社会主义建设贡献自己的一份力量。
    上海市律师协会筹备会根据他们的要求，在正式开始工作前，帮助他们先学习“八大”文件，以后，还将帮助他们联系实际来学习马克思列宁主义关于国家和法律方面的理论，以及苏联和中国的律师制度。经过短期学习后，他们将被分派到各法律顾问处工作。
