    Take Care to Preserve Excavated Cultural Relics
    On October 11, the People's Daily published a reader's letter entitled "Fossils Excavated from Yu Hill are Damaged." We believe the reader's criticism is basically correct. Our quarry has educated all team staff, stipulating that any deformed stones that are difficult to identify during future mining shall not be discarded or damaged arbitrarily, and shall be sent to the local cultural relics preservation department for identification by the quarry headquarters.

    注意保管掘出的文物
    10月11日，人民日报刊登了一封题为“从虞山掘出的化石被损毁了”的读者来信。我们认为读者的批评基本上是正确的。我场已对各队工作人员进行了教育，规定凡在今后开采中挖掘到很难识别的变形石头，一律不准任意抛弃或损坏，统一由场部送往当地文物保管部去鉴别。
