Xinhua News Agency, Yanji, 30th - The Dawn Agricultural Cooperative in Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, saw its total grain output increase by 17.3% this year compared to last year. According to the distribution regulations of the cooperative's charter, over 90% of the members' incomes have increased compared to last year.

　　The Dawn Cooperative is led by the famous labor model Jin Shilong. It was the first advanced cooperative to be established in minority areas in the spring of 1953. This spring, it merged with five surrounding villages to form a large cooperative and continued to implement technical reforms and improve its management level. The total amount of fertilizer applied to the cooperative's cultivated land increased threefold compared to last year, and more than 500 hectares of new paddy fields were opened up. This year, land cultivated using tractors and new-style animal-drawn farm implements accounted for 30% of the total cultivated area in the cooperative. According to a survey by the Second Production Team, yields of various crops increased by 20% to 35% compared to using old farm implements. Of the cooperative's 1,197 hectares of paddy fields, all but 18 hectares adopted advanced close-planting transplanting methods or close-planting direct seeding methods. These factors ensured that the Dawn Cooperative still increased production despite being affected by disasters.

　　In addition, the Dawn Cooperative also paid attention to diversified operations. This year, the collective sideline income from fruit trees, animal husbandry, and other ventures totaled more than 20,000 yuan.

    新华社延吉30日电　延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县黎明农业社，今年粮食总产量比去年增加17.3％。按照社章规定进行分配的结果，90％以上社员的收入都比去年增加了。
    黎明社由著名劳动模范金时龙领导，它是1953年春在少数民族地区中最先试办的高级社。它今春和周围五个村合并成一个大社，继续进行技术改革，提高经营管理水平。全社耕地施肥量比去年增加三倍，又新开了五百多公顷稻田。今年全社使用拖拉机和畜力新式农具耕作的土地，占耕地总面积的30％。据第二生产队的调查，各种农作物比使用旧农具增产20％到35％。全社一千一百九十七公顷稻田，除十八公顷外，都采用了先进的密植插秧法或密植直播法。这些，都保证黎明社在受灾情况下仍然增产。
    另外，黎明社也注意了多种经营，今年果木、畜牧等集体副业收入共有两万多元。
