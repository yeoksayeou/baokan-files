　　Promote the Practice of Selecting and Appointing Parents as Counselors

　　More than six thousand parents in Hangzhou who love and care about children's education have taken on the work of after-school counselors for students. This is an exciting and highly commendable thing.

　　This year, primary and secondary schools have developed rapidly, and the number of enrollments has greatly increased compared with previous years, appropriately meeting the people's demand for sending their children to school, but this has also created some new problems. One of the more prominent problems is that since many cities' middle and primary schools have implemented a two-shift system, a large number of children spend half of their day outside of school. They lack activity venues, proper cultural and recreational activities, and guidance, resulting in a very poor content of after-school life. According to reports from Shanghai, Beijing, Shenyang, and other places, a large number of children often wander the streets, develop many bad habits, live loosely, disobey discipline, curse and fight, lie, and some even commit theft.

　　Hangzhou's approach of selecting and appointing a large number of parents who care about children's learning to serve as after-school counselors is very good. On the one hand, it fully utilizes the enthusiasm and strength of the masses, helping the government to overcome difficulties such as insufficient manpower, school buildings, and activity venues, and creates a good learning and living environment for children outside of school; on the other hand, it also strengthens the connection between schools and families, and strengthens parents' education of their children. In this way, it is possible to avoid children being affected by certain unhealthy factors in society, which is conducive to the physical and mental development of children.

　　Caring for children's learning and life outside of school is the business of the entire society, and the forms of after-school education for children are also diverse. Although "family self-study activity groups" organize elementary school students together and have parents help them with homework and games, it will cultivate certain good habits. However, it is far from meeting the diverse learning and activity requirements of children. To make children's after-school life rich and colorful and to educate children well, relying solely on this method is not enough. We hope that parents, schools, after-school children's education institutions, and certain public cultural and entertainment venues, such as parks, cinemas, and cultural centers, will all care about and jointly do a good job in children's after-school education.

### 推广选聘家长担任辅导员的作法

　　推广选聘家长担任辅导员的作法
　　山佳
    杭州市六千多位热爱、关怀儿童教育的家长，担任了学生校外辅导员工作。这是一件令人兴奋和值得大力提倡的事情。
    今年小学、中学发展很快，招生人数比往年有了很大的增加，适当满足了人民群众送子女入学学习的要求，但由此而产生了若干新的问题。其中比较突出的问题就是许多城市的中、小学实行二部制以后，大量的少年儿童每天有一半的时间生活在校外。他们既缺乏活动场所，没有正当的文化娱乐生活，也缺少人辅导，因而校外生活的内容非常贫乏。据上海、北京、沈阳等地反映，目前有大量少年儿童经常在街头游荡，养成许多不良习惯，生活散漫，不遵守纪律，骂人打架，撒谎，有的甚至发生偷窃行为。
    杭州市大量选聘关心儿童学习的家长担任校外辅导员的办法是很好的。它一方面充分发挥了群众的积极性和力量，帮助政府克服人力、校舍、活动场所不足的困难，为少年儿童创造了校外良好的学习和生活环境；另一方面也密切了学校与家庭的联系，加强了家长对子女的教育。这样，就有可能避免少年儿童受到社会上某些不健康因素的影响，有利于少年儿童身心的发展。
    关心少年儿童在校外的学习和生活是整个社会的事情，对少年儿童进行校外教育的形式也是多样的。“家庭自学活动小组”虽然把小学生组织在一起，由家长帮助他们做做家庭作业、游戏，会培养他们一定的良好习惯。但是远不能满足少年儿童多方面的学习和活动的要求。要使少年儿童的校外生活丰富多采，把少年儿童教育好，光靠这种办法还是不够的。我们希望家长、学校、校外儿童教育机关，某些公共文化娱乐场所，如公园、电影院、文化馆等各方面，都来关心和共同做好少年儿童的校外教育工作。
