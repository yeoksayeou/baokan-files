Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 6th. Construction of the Huilongzhai Hydropower Station, the third cascade power station on the Longxi River in Changshou County, Sichuan Province, began on December 5th.

　　The Huilongzhai Hydropower Station is being built downstream of the Shizitan Hydropower Station, the first cascade. Its designed power generation capacity is equivalent to one-third of that of the Shizitan Hydropower Station. Since the Shizitan Reservoir already regulates the river's flow, there is no need to build a very large reservoir. The basic construction investment per kilowatt of power at the Huilongzhai Hydropower Station is expected to be only half that of the Shizitan Hydropower Station.

　　The Huilongzhai Hydropower Station project was not originally included in the First Five-Year Plan. Later, because of the rapid industrial development in Chongqing and the rapidly increasing need for electricity, the state decided to advance the construction and strive to complete it and generate electricity in about one year.

　　The workers participating in the construction of this hydropower station were newly trained at the Shizitan Hydropower Station. After basically completing the Shizitan hydropower project in more than two years, they came to this new hydropower construction site.

　　龙溪河上的新电站
    新华社重庆6日电　四川长寿县龙溪河第三梯级电站——廻龙寨水电站5日开工兴建。
    廻龙寨水电站建设在第一梯级狮子滩水电站下游，它的设计发电能力相当于狮子滩水电站的三分之一。由于已经有狮子滩水库调节河水的流量，不必再修建很大的水库，廻龙寨水电站每瓩电力的基本建设投资，预计只有狮子滩水电站的一半。
    廻龙寨水电站的工程，原来没有列入第一个五年计划，后来因为重庆市工业发展迅速，电力需要增加很快，国家才决定提前修建，并且争取用一年左右的时间建成发电。
    参加建设这个水电站的职工，是在狮子滩水电站新培养起来的。他们在两年多的时间内基本上完成了狮子滩水电工程以后，又来到了这个新的水电建设工地。
