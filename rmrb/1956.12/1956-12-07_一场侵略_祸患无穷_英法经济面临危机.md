Xinhua News Agency, London, December 5th: Economic collapse is the result of Britain's Suez Canal adventure, and the reason for Britain's retreat.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Macmillan told the House of Commons on December 4 that in November, Britain's gold and dollar reserves decreased by $279 million, and the current reserves are $1.965 billion. That is to say, it has broken through the crisis level of $2 billion.

Macmillan said that in order to deal with this situation, he will increase the tariff on gasoline, kerosene, and light hydrocarbon oil by one shilling per gallon. In addition, oil companies will increase the price of all grades of oil by three and a half pence per gallon, and retailers will increase it by one and a half pence per gallon. This will increase the price of gasoline by one shilling and five pence per gallon, which is about one-third higher than the original price on the evening of the 4th. Macmillan also warned that income taxes may be increased to strengthen gold and dollar reserves.

According to Macmillan, other measures the government will take include immediately contacting the International Monetary Fund to withdraw part of the savings and trying to stop paying interest on loans from the United States and Canada. He said that the US Treasury Department has agreed to submit this issue to Congress.

Macmillan only explained a part of the tragic situation. This is only the first batch of prices that Britain has to pay for gambling in Egypt. In fact, Britain has seriously felt the economic consequences of military action. The most widespread and easily felt is the lack of gasoline. Under normal circumstances, 75% of Britain's gasoline is shipped from the Middle East.

The first victim of restrictions on gasoline use is the automobile industry. Jaguar's car factory in Coventry had to stipulate for the first time that it would only work four days a week. Automobile production must be cut by more than one-third. In addition, among the 4,000 workers, the phenomenon of surplus labor is inevitable.

Union leaders predict that the number of unemployed will soon double, reaching the level of 500,000. They worry that by the New Year, the number of workers with shortened hours will increase three or four times.

The shipping industry has also been severely affected. In the past month, freight prices for tramp freighters have risen by 40% to 60%, reaching an unprecedented peak so far. Due to the many difficulties in shipping, one in every nine dockworkers in London is currently unemployed.

With rising costs, rising freight and marine insurance rates, and reduced inventories, prices are also beginning to rise. In London, the price of ordinary Indian tea is now one shilling and one penny per pound more expensive than in the second half of October, coarse sugar has risen by 50%, and wool prices have risen by 7.5% to 15% compared with a month ago.

Soaring prices actually affect the lives of people from all walks of life. This may trigger another movement demanding wage increases.

Lloyd said to the Conservative Party Foreign Affairs Committee on the evening of the 4th that the economic consequences of closing the canal were the main factors forcing the government to withdraw from Egypt. This sentence emphasizes the significance of Macmillan's gloomy report.

Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: TASS, Paris, December 5th: The economic difficulties in France caused by the blockade of the Suez Canal and the interruption of the source of oil from the Near East are intensifying. At present, dozens of factories have either laid off some workers or implemented incomplete work weeks and reduced wages. In order to oppose this measure, the workers have established workers' committees.

The government is also unable to use coal to compensate for the shortage of oil products.

Paris taxi drivers are also very dissatisfied because the implementation of gasoline rationing has greatly reduced their wages.

The economic commentator of "Combat" pointed out that France's serious economic difficulties will greatly consume France's dollar reserves, increase the fiscal deficit, and pose a threat of rising prices. The newspaper wrote that the 1957 budget was outdated before it was approved. It pointed out: "Military expenditures will be greater than the prescribed figure, and income will be less than hoped. The prospect of an oil crisis and the economic crisis caused by the oil crisis will invalidate most of the items in the budget currently being discussed."

France's financial situation in the European Payments Union also deteriorated in mid-November: its dollar deficit in the Payments Union increased to $93 million, while in November last year, it had a surplus of $3.6 million.

### 一场侵略　祸患无穷　英法经济面临危机

　  一场侵略　祸患无穷
　　英法经济面临危机
    据新华社伦敦5日电　经济濒于崩溃是英国在苏伊士运河的冒险结果，又是英国退却的原因。
    财政大臣麦克米伦12月4日在下院说：在11月份，英国的黄金和美元储备量减少了二亿七千九百万美元，现在的储备量是十九亿六千五百万美元。这就是说，它已经突破了危机水平二十亿美元的大关。
    麦克米伦说，为了应付这种情况，他将把汽油、煤油和轻碳化氢油的关税每加仑提高一先令。此外，各石油公司将把各级油的价格每加仑提高三个半便士，另外，推销商每加仑将提高一个半便士。这将使汽油价格每加仑提高一先令五便士，即比4日晚的原来价格高三分之一左右。麦克米伦并警告说，可能增加所得税来加强黄金和美元储备。
    据麦克米伦说，政府将采取的其他措施包括马上同国际货币基金组织接洽，以便提取部分储金，并且设法停止支付美国和加拿大贷款的利息。他说美国财政部已经答应把这个问题提交国会。
    麦克米伦只是说明了悲惨景况的一部分。这只是英国为了在埃及进行冒险的赌注而不得不付出的第一批代价。事实上，英国已经严重感觉到军事行动的经济后果。最广泛而最容易感觉到的是缺乏汽油。在正常情况下，英国汽油的75％是从中东运来的。
    限制使用汽油的第一个受害者是汽车工业。考文垂的贾古尔汽车工厂有史以来第一次不得不规定每星期只工作四天。汽车产量必须削减三分之一之多，此外，在四千名工人中，人力过剩的现象是不可避免的。
    工会领袖们预料，失业人数不久将增加一倍，达到五十万的水平。他们担心到新年的时候，缩短工作的工人人数将增加到三倍或四倍。
    航运业也受到了严重的影响。近一个月来，不定期货船的货运价格已经上涨了40％到60％，达到了到现在为止空前的高峰。由于航运上的困难重重，目前伦敦的每九个码头工人中间有一个是失业的。
    随着成本的上涨、运费和海上保险费的上升以及存货的减少，物价也正在开始上涨。在伦敦，普通的印度茶叶价格现在每磅比10月下半月贵了一先令一便士，粗糖上涨了50％，羊毛价格比一个月以前涨了7.5％到15％。
    飞涨的价格实际上影响了各个阶层的人们的生活。这可能引起另一次要求增加工资的运动。
    劳埃德4日晚上在保守党外交委员会说，封闭运河在经济上所发生的后果是迫使政府从埃及撤退的主要因素。这句话强调说明了麦克米伦的阴郁的报告的意义。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社巴黎5日讯：法国由于苏伊士运河的被封锁和近东石油的来源断绝而引起的经济困难正日益加剧。目前已经有几十个工厂不是解雇了一部分工人，就是实行了不完全的工作周和减低了工资。为了反对这种措施，工人已经成立了工人委员会。
    政府也无法用煤来补偿石油产品的不足。
    巴黎出租汽车的司机也感到非常不满，因为实行汽油配给制使得他们的工资大大减少了。
      “战斗报”经济评论员指出，法国严重的经济困难会大量消耗法国的美元储备，增加财政赤字，并且造成物价高涨的威胁。报纸写道，1957年的预算等不到批准就已经过时了，它指出：“军费将比所规定的数字更大，收入将比所希望的更少。石油危机和因为石油危机而产生的经济危机的前景将会使得目前所讨论的预算的大多数项目失去时效。”
    法国在欧洲支付同盟中的财政情况在11月中也恶化了：它在支付同盟中的美元赤字增加到九千三百万美元，而在去年11月，它却有三百六十万美元的结余。
