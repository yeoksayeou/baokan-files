Background of Ishibashi's Rise to Power and Future Japanese Situation
    Zhuang Tao
    The Japanese Hatoyama Cabinet announced its general resignation on the 20th of this month. The new cabinet headed by Ishibashi Tanzan was also sworn in on the 23rd. The new cabinet consists of sixteen cabinet members. Among them, the post of Foreign Minister is held by Kishi Nobusuke, the former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party. Kishi himself is one of the leaders of the former Hatoyama mainstream faction (i.e., the ruling faction) of the Liberal Democratic Party. In this new cabinet, in addition to Kishi, there are also Kishi's supporters such as Minister of Justice Umejiro Nakamura, Minister of Transport Taneomi Miyazawa, and Minister of Construction Tokuo Nanjo. In addition, Minister of International Trade and Industry Mikio Mizuta and Minister of Health Hiroshi Kanda, who belong to the Ohno Banboku faction, also belong to the former Hatoyama mainstream faction. Hayato Ikeda of the Yoshida faction (Yoshida Shigeru himself did not participate in the Liberal Democratic Party, but manipulated it from outside the party) will serve as the Minister of Finance in the new cabinet this time. Among the new cabinet members, only Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida, who belongs to the Ishibashi faction and its supporters, and Koichi Uda, the Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency, Iitaro Ide, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and Shutar≈ç Matsuura, the Minister of Labor, who belong to the former Progressive Party system.
    From the above list of cabinet members of the Ishibashi Cabinet, it can be clearly seen that the former Hatoyama mainstream faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, led by Nobusuke Kishi, occupies an important position. This also shows that the new Ishibashi Cabinet will basically be a continuation of the past Hatoyama Cabinet, but will adopt a more active approach to foreign and domestic policies than the Hatoyama Cabinet. Secondly, this list of cabinet members also shows that it is the result of a temporary compromise reached by the various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party after a fierce struggle, and it includes representatives from the Ishibashi faction to the Yoshida faction. The foundation of the new cabinet is extremely unstable. The long-standing desire of the Japanese ruling class to stabilize the political situation is, after all, not easy to achieve.
    On the other hand, Ishibashi himself has always been known as a promoter of Sino-Japanese trade and is also regarded as an old liberal within the conservative party who advocates peaceful coexistence. The forced resignation of Hatoyama and the rise of Ishibashi to form a cabinet were by no means accidental; it objectively reflects that the Japanese people's struggle for peace and independence is developing.
    Ichiro Hatoyama came to power at the end of 1954, succeeding Shigeru Yoshida. At that time, he reversed the extremely pro-American policy pursued by the Yoshida Cabinet and proposed to restore normal relations with our country and the Soviet Union, thus gaining the support of the Japanese people. However, after Hatoyama came to power, he did not faithfully fulfill his promises. Under the pressure of the Japanese people, although the Hatoyama Cabinet began negotiations with the Soviet Union in June last year, in the course of the negotiations, it was always held hostage and influenced by American imperialists and a small number of pro-American elements in Japan headed by Yoshida, which made the negotiations protracted and unable to reach an agreement for a long time. After the end of March this year, the negotiations between the Soviet and Japanese sides in London were in fact in a state of indefinite adjournment. Later, due to the Soviet Union's concessions, the Soviet and Japanese sides held separate negotiations on fishery issues in Moscow from the end of April. This negotiation reached an agreement in mid-May, and the two sides signed a fishery treaty and a maritime rescue agreement, stipulating that these treaties and agreements would come into effect from the date of entry into force of the Soviet-Japanese Peace Treaty or the resumption of diplomatic relations between the Soviet and Japanese sides. At the same time, both sides pointed out in a joint communique that negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations must be resumed as soon as possible before July 31. In addition, in improving Sino-Japanese relations, the Hatoyama Cabinet did not do much during this period except to relax restrictions on personnel exchanges between the two sides and promote some development of Sino-Japanese trade, and the issue of sending commercial representatives between China and Japan has never been resolved.
    This passive attitude adopted by the Hatoyama Cabinet in improving Soviet-Japanese and Sino-Japanese relations, coupled with the domestic policies of advocating revising the constitution, rearming Japan, suppressing the Japanese people's struggle against American military bases, and suppressing the Japanese workers' struggle to improve their lives, greatly reduced the prestige of the Hatoyama Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party among the people. The Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in the Japanese House of Councillors election in July this year is proof of this.
    In July this year, Japan held an election to re-elect half of the seats in the House of Councillors (125 seats). Before this election, the Liberal Democratic Party tried every means to obtain a two-thirds majority in the House of Councillors in order to achieve the goal of revising the constitution and accelerating the rearmament of Japan. However, the results of the election showed that the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other non-party progressive members increased from 74 seats before the re-election to 86 seats, breaking through one-third of the total number of seats in the House of Councillors, making the Liberal Democratic Party's intention to manipulate the parliament and revise the constitution impossible to achieve for at least the next three years. This is a great victory for the forces in Japan demanding peace and independence and cannot but be a serious blow to the Hatoyama Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party.
    After the Liberal Democratic Party suffered a defeat in the House of Councillors election, the strength of the Hatoyama mainstream faction within the party was weakened. Other factions within the party attacked the Hatoyama Cabinet from the right or left, vying for power and profit, and attempting to force Hatoyama to step down and take power themselves. This formed the intensification of the political struggle within the ruling party in Japan in recent months.
    As everyone knows, the Liberal Democratic Party was formed on November 15 last year by the merger of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party, two conservative parties, and contains various opinions and differences. Generally speaking, it can be divided into two major factions: the Hatoyama mainstream faction and the anti-Hatoyama mainstream faction. The Hatoyama mainstream faction is composed of several people in power within the Liberal Democratic Party and the Hatoyama Cabinet and their supporters. Such as the Kishi Secretary-General faction, the Ohno faction, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kono faction, the Hatoyama direct line and the Oasa Yuio faction, they all have certain connections with Japanese financial groups, basically support Hatoyama, and are the decision-makers of the Hatoyama Cabinet's policies. The anti-Hatoyama mainstream faction can be divided into two types: one is the Yoshida faction controlled by the pro-American element Yoshida, whose representatives include Hayato Ikeda. The Ishii Mitsujiro faction, which belongs to the late Ogata Taketora faction, the head of the former Liberal Party, is close to this faction. The other type is the Matsumura Kenzo and Miki Takeo factions belonging to the former Progressive Party system. They are closer to the financial groups in Kansai, Japan, and actively demand the development of trade with our country, the Soviet Union, and Southeast Asian countries, and advocate a more "independent" stance toward the United States. The Ishibashi faction itself is relatively weak, but it has supporters among the Matsumura and Miki factions, the Kono faction, and the Hatoyama direct line of the former Progressive Party system. These factions, starting from their own different interests, expressed dissatisfaction with the Hatoyama mainstream faction, attacked them, and demanded Hatoyama's resignation.
    Under the above circumstances, in order to alleviate the people's dissatisfaction, stabilize the political situation, and obtain more political capital for the Hatoyama mainstream faction, Hatoyama went to Moscow on October 12 to resume Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Before Hatoyama went to Moscow, the Yoshida faction, in order to finally obstruct the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, joined the Ishii faction and others to form the "Situation Discussion Group," and, on the pretext of the territorial issue, firmly opposed the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet and Japanese sides. But their efforts were not successful. With the support of the people throughout Japan and most factions within the Liberal Democratic Party, the negotiations reached an agreement on the 19th, and the Joint Declaration on the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between the Soviet and Japanese Sides was issued. On December 12, the Soviet and Japanese sides exchanged instruments of ratification of the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration and other relevant documents. The state of war between the Soviet and Japanese sides was thus declared over, and diplomatic relations between the two countries were officially restored. At this point, Hatoyama retired bravely and formally announced his resignation from the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party. At that time, the goal of the Hatoyama mainstream faction was to replace Hatoyama with Nobusuke Kishi, realizing the so-called plan of Kishi as president, Ohno as vice president, and Kono as secretary-general. The Yoshida faction knew that it was spurned by the people and was not conducive to running for president, so it supported Ishii Mitsujiro to run for election. Matsumura, Miki, and other former Progressive Party systems supported Ishibashi. As a result, a struggle was formed between Kishi, Ishii, and Ishibashi for the presidency.
    In the process of the election, Kishi won 223 votes in the first round, Ishibashi won 151 votes, and Ishii won 137 votes. Since no one won more than half of the votes, a second vote was held between Kishi and Ishibashi. As a result of the Yoshida and Ishii factions turning to support Ishibashi, Ishibashi won the election with 258 votes to 251 votes, defeating Kishi and being elected president. Here, the support of the Yoshida faction, the Ishii faction, and others for Ishibashi was entirely out of a selfish intention: they clearly saw that the Kishi faction had a relatively strong force within the party, and if the Kishi faction was elected president to succeed Hatoyama and form a cabinet, their future voice would be greatly restricted; conversely, if Ishibashi came to power, then they could use the contradiction between Ishibashi and Kishi and Ishibashi's own weakness in the party to contain Ishibashi, so as to form a situation of tripartite confrontation within the party. Therefore, the union of the Yoshida faction, the Ishii faction, and the Ishibashi faction in the final election was not based on policy, but to jointly resist the Kishi faction. This creates the instability of the Ishibashi Cabinet. The large number of Kishi faction members entering the cabinet, the participation of the Yoshida faction in the cabinet, and the difficult birth of the new cabinet all prove the intensity of the struggle between them. But on the whole, from Yoshida to Hatoyama, from Hatoyama to Ishibashi, it cannot but objectively reflect the development of the Japanese people's struggle for peace and independence.
    Ishibashi's rise to power is also deeply rooted in Japan's domestic and foreign economic relations. Since the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950 and turned Japan into a supply base for the US military in Korea, Japan's economy has achieved rapid recovery and development on the basis of economic militarization. After the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in July 1953, Japan's economy once experienced a crisis of overproduction. However, this crisis did not last long. Due to the large increase in Japan's exports after 1953, Japanese capitalists used the profits obtained from the Korean War and export trade to massively renew fixed capital and increase equipment investment since 1951, and the Japanese government continued to issue a considerable amount of military orders every year. Since the second half of 1954, Japan's industrial and mining production has risen rapidly again. By August this year, Japan's industrial and mining production index had reached 228.1% of the average production level from 1934 to 1936, that is, an increase of more than one and a quarter times compared with before the war.
    Compared with the rapid improvement of the level of industrial and mining production, Japan's foreign trade has also increased significantly in recent years, but there is still a big gap between the two. Taking last year as an example, last year Japan's average industrial and mining production index was 187.7% of the average production level from 1934 to 1936, but the export trade index only reached 71.6% of the same period. Although Japan's export trade has increased significantly this year, it can only recover to about 90% of the average level from 1934 to 1936 at most. This huge gap between production and exports cannot but become a serious problem for Japan, which is highly dependent on foreign trade, especially after the Japanese monopoly capital's plan to revise the constitution and accelerate the rearmament of Japan has suffered some setbacks. In terms of international affairs, the war launched by Britain, France, and Israel to invade Egypt has brought serious difficulties to the economies of the British and French imperialists themselves. Some people in Japanese business circles are already worried that this difficulty will eventually affect the United States and bring adverse effects to Japan. Therefore, Ishibashi's active advocacy of developing trade with our country, the Soviet Union, and Southeast Asian countries coincides with the intentions of the Japanese bourgeoisie. Before accepting the formation of the cabinet, Ishibashi repeatedly pointed out that efforts should be made to develop trade between Japan and its neighboring countries.
    Before and after Ishibashi came to power, he made several talks on the new cabinet's future foreign and domestic policies. According to these talks, the new cabinet's future policies will include the following aspects: First, Ishibashi said that his cabinet will not adopt a "leaning to the United States" approach, and demanded to "adjust Japan-US relations"; but on the other hand, he also demanded that the United States eliminate its "misunderstandings" about him, tolerate the restrictions of the United States, and declared that "willing to take the United States as the leader," "Japan will never establish diplomatic relations with Communist China regardless of the free world." Secondly, he said that he would consult with the United States to promote economic relations with our country as much as possible; and he expressed the hope that the United Nations would change its current attitude toward China. Third, he expressed his willingness to hold treaty negotiations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible, develop trade with the Soviet Union, actively develop trade with Southeast Asian countries, and implement technical cooperation with Asian and African countries. Finally, in terms of domestic policy, he said that he would actively support Japan's financial groups. Therefore, on the whole, the new cabinet will not have significant differences from the Hatoyama Cabinet, only some differences in degree. However, the broad masses of the Japanese people are determined to take the path of peace and independence. Whether the weak Ishibashi Cabinet can overcome difficulties and stabilize the political situation in the future Japanese situation will ultimately depend on whether it can not violate the wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people.
