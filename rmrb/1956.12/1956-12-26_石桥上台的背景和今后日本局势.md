Background of Ishibashi's Rise to Power and Future Japanese Situation
    Zhuang Tao
    The Japanese Hatoyama Cabinet announced its general resignation on the 20th of this month. The new cabinet headed by Ishibashi Tanzan was also sworn in on the 23rd. The new cabinet consists of sixteen cabinet members. Among them, the post of Foreign Minister is held by Kishi Nobusuke, the former Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party. Kishi himself is one of the leaders of the former Hatoyama mainstream faction (i.e., the ruling faction) of the Liberal Democratic Party. In this new cabinet, in addition to Kishi, there are also Kishi's supporters such as Minister of Justice Umejiro Nakamura, Minister of Transport Taneomi Miyazawa, and Minister of Construction Tokuo Nanjo. In addition, Minister of International Trade and Industry Mikio Mizuta and Minister of Health Hiroshi Kanda, who belong to the Ohno Banboku faction, also belong to the former Hatoyama mainstream faction. Hayato Ikeda of the Yoshida faction (Yoshida Shigeru himself did not participate in the Liberal Democratic Party, but manipulated it from outside the party) will serve as the Minister of Finance in the new cabinet this time. Among the new cabinet members, only Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida, who belongs to the Ishibashi faction and its supporters, and Koichi Uda, the Director-General of the Economic Planning Agency, Iitaro Ide, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, and Shutarō Matsuura, the Minister of Labor, who belong to the former Progressive Party system.
    From the above list of cabinet members of the Ishibashi Cabinet, it can be clearly seen that the former Hatoyama mainstream faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, led by Nobusuke Kishi, occupies an important position. This also shows that the new Ishibashi Cabinet will basically be a continuation of the past Hatoyama Cabinet, but will adopt a more active approach to foreign and domestic policies than the Hatoyama Cabinet. Secondly, this list of cabinet members also shows that it is the result of a temporary compromise reached by the various factions within the Liberal Democratic Party after a fierce struggle, and it includes representatives from the Ishibashi faction to the Yoshida faction. The foundation of the new cabinet is extremely unstable. The long-standing desire of the Japanese ruling class to stabilize the political situation is, after all, not easy to achieve.
    On the other hand, Ishibashi himself has always been known as a promoter of Sino-Japanese trade and is also regarded as an old liberal within the conservative party who advocates peaceful coexistence. The forced resignation of Hatoyama and the rise of Ishibashi to form a cabinet were by no means accidental; it objectively reflects that the Japanese people's struggle for peace and independence is developing.
    Ichiro Hatoyama came to power at the end of 1954, succeeding Shigeru Yoshida. At that time, he reversed the extremely pro-American policy pursued by the Yoshida Cabinet and proposed to restore normal relations with our country and the Soviet Union, thus gaining the support of the Japanese people. However, after Hatoyama came to power, he did not faithfully fulfill his promises. Under the pressure of the Japanese people, although the Hatoyama Cabinet began negotiations with the Soviet Union in June last year, in the course of the negotiations, it was always held hostage and influenced by American imperialists and a small number of pro-American elements in Japan headed by Yoshida, which made the negotiations protracted and unable to reach an agreement for a long time. After the end of March this year, the negotiations between the Soviet and Japanese sides in London were in fact in a state of indefinite adjournment. Later, due to the Soviet Union's concessions, the Soviet and Japanese sides held separate negotiations on fishery issues in Moscow from the end of April. This negotiation reached an agreement in mid-May, and the two sides signed a fishery treaty and a maritime rescue agreement, stipulating that these treaties and agreements would come into effect from the date of entry into force of the Soviet-Japanese Peace Treaty or the resumption of diplomatic relations between the Soviet and Japanese sides. At the same time, both sides pointed out in a joint communique that negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations must be resumed as soon as possible before July 31. In addition, in improving Sino-Japanese relations, the Hatoyama Cabinet did not do much during this period except to relax restrictions on personnel exchanges between the two sides and promote some development of Sino-Japanese trade, and the issue of sending commercial representatives between China and Japan has never been resolved.
    This passive attitude adopted by the Hatoyama Cabinet in improving Soviet-Japanese and Sino-Japanese relations, coupled with the domestic policies of advocating revising the constitution, rearming Japan, suppressing the Japanese people's struggle against American military bases, and suppressing the Japanese workers' struggle to improve their lives, greatly reduced the prestige of the Hatoyama Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party among the people. The Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in the Japanese House of Councillors election in July this year is proof of this.
    In July this year, Japan held an election to re-elect half of the seats in the House of Councillors (125 seats). Before this election, the Liberal Democratic Party tried every means to obtain a two-thirds majority in the House of Councillors in order to achieve the goal of revising the constitution and accelerating the rearmament of Japan. However, the results of the election showed that the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and other non-party progressive members increased from 74 seats before the re-election to 86 seats, breaking through one-third of the total number of seats in the House of Councillors, making the Liberal Democratic Party's intention to manipulate the parliament and revise the constitution impossible to achieve for at least the next three years. This is a great victory for the forces in Japan demanding peace and independence and cannot but be a serious blow to the Hatoyama Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party.
    After the Liberal Democratic Party suffered a defeat in the House of Councillors election, the strength of the Hatoyama mainstream faction within the party was weakened. Other factions within the party attacked the Hatoyama Cabinet from the right or left, vying for power and profit, and attempting to force Hatoyama to step down and take power themselves. This formed the intensification of the political struggle within the ruling party in Japan in recent months.
    As everyone knows, the Liberal Democratic Party was formed on November 15 last year by the merger of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party, two conservative parties, and contains various opinions and differences. Generally speaking, it can be divided into two major factions: the Hatoyama mainstream faction and the anti-Hatoyama mainstream faction. The Hatoyama mainstream faction is composed of several people in power within the Liberal Democratic Party and the Hatoyama Cabinet and their supporters. Such as the Kishi Secretary-General faction, the Ohno faction, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Kono faction, the Hatoyama direct line and the Oasa Yuio faction, they all have certain connections with Japanese financial groups, basically support Hatoyama, and are the decision-makers of the Hatoyama Cabinet's policies. The anti-Hatoyama mainstream faction can be divided into two types: one is the Yoshida faction controlled by the pro-American element Yoshida, whose representatives include Hayato Ikeda. The Ishii Mitsujiro faction, which belongs to the late Ogata Taketora faction, the head of the former Liberal Party, is close to this faction. The other type is the Matsumura Kenzo and Miki Takeo factions belonging to the former Progressive Party system. They are closer to the financial groups in Kansai, Japan, and actively demand the development of trade with our country, the Soviet Union, and Southeast Asian countries, and advocate a more "independent" stance toward the United States. The Ishibashi faction itself is relatively weak, but it has supporters among the Matsumura and Miki factions, the Kono faction, and the Hatoyama direct line of the former Progressive Party system. These factions, starting from their own different interests, expressed dissatisfaction with the Hatoyama mainstream faction, attacked them, and demanded Hatoyama's resignation.
    Under the above circumstances, in order to alleviate the people's dissatisfaction, stabilize the political situation, and obtain more political capital for the Hatoyama mainstream faction, Hatoyama went to Moscow on October 12 to resume Soviet-Japanese negotiations. Before Hatoyama went to Moscow, the Yoshida faction, in order to finally obstruct the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations, joined the Ishii faction and others to form the "Situation Discussion Group," and, on the pretext of the territorial issue, firmly opposed the restoration of normal relations between the Soviet and Japanese sides. But their efforts were not successful. With the support of the people throughout Japan and most factions within the Liberal Democratic Party, the negotiations reached an agreement on the 19th, and the Joint Declaration on the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between the Soviet and Japanese Sides was issued. On December 12, the Soviet and Japanese sides exchanged instruments of ratification of the Soviet-Japanese Joint Declaration and other relevant documents. The state of war between the Soviet and Japanese sides was thus declared over, and diplomatic relations between the two countries were officially restored. At this point, Hatoyama retired bravely and formally announced his resignation from the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party. At that time, the goal of the Hatoyama mainstream faction was to replace Hatoyama with Nobusuke Kishi, realizing the so-called plan of Kishi as president, Ohno as vice president, and Kono as secretary-general. The Yoshida faction knew that it was spurned by the people and was not conducive to running for president, so it supported Ishii Mitsujiro to run for election. Matsumura, Miki, and other former Progressive Party systems supported Ishibashi. As a result, a struggle was formed between Kishi, Ishii, and Ishibashi for the presidency.
    In the process of the election, Kishi won 223 votes in the first round, Ishibashi won 151 votes, and Ishii won 137 votes. Since no one won more than half of the votes, a second vote was held between Kishi and Ishibashi. As a result of the Yoshida and Ishii factions turning to support Ishibashi, Ishibashi won the election with 258 votes to 251 votes, defeating Kishi and being elected president. Here, the support of the Yoshida faction, the Ishii faction, and others for Ishibashi was entirely out of a selfish intention: they clearly saw that the Kishi faction had a relatively strong force within the party, and if the Kishi faction was elected president to succeed Hatoyama and form a cabinet, their future voice would be greatly restricted; conversely, if Ishibashi came to power, then they could use the contradiction between Ishibashi and Kishi and Ishibashi's own weakness in the party to contain Ishibashi, so as to form a situation of tripartite confrontation within the party. Therefore, the union of the Yoshida faction, the Ishii faction, and the Ishibashi faction in the final election was not based on policy, but to jointly resist the Kishi faction. This creates the instability of the Ishibashi Cabinet. The large number of Kishi faction members entering the cabinet, the participation of the Yoshida faction in the cabinet, and the difficult birth of the new cabinet all prove the intensity of the struggle between them. But on the whole, from Yoshida to Hatoyama, from Hatoyama to Ishibashi, it cannot but objectively reflect the development of the Japanese people's struggle for peace and independence.
    Ishibashi's rise to power is also deeply rooted in Japan's domestic and foreign economic relations. Since the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950 and turned Japan into a supply base for the US military in Korea, Japan's economy has achieved rapid recovery and development on the basis of economic militarization. After the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in July 1953, Japan's economy once experienced a crisis of overproduction. However, this crisis did not last long. Due to the large increase in Japan's exports after 1953, Japanese capitalists used the profits obtained from the Korean War and export trade to massively renew fixed capital and increase equipment investment since 1951, and the Japanese government continued to issue a considerable amount of military orders every year. Since the second half of 1954, Japan's industrial and mining production has risen rapidly again. By August this year, Japan's industrial and mining production index had reached 228.1% of the average production level from 1934 to 1936, that is, an increase of more than one and a quarter times compared with before the war.
    Compared with the rapid improvement of the level of industrial and mining production, Japan's foreign trade has also increased significantly in recent years, but there is still a big gap between the two. Taking last year as an example, last year Japan's average industrial and mining production index was 187.7% of the average production level from 1934 to 1936, but the export trade index only reached 71.6% of the same period. Although Japan's export trade has increased significantly this year, it can only recover to about 90% of the average level from 1934 to 1936 at most. This huge gap between production and exports cannot but become a serious problem for Japan, which is highly dependent on foreign trade, especially after the Japanese monopoly capital's plan to revise the constitution and accelerate the rearmament of Japan has suffered some setbacks. In terms of international affairs, the war launched by Britain, France, and Israel to invade Egypt has brought serious difficulties to the economies of the British and French imperialists themselves. Some people in Japanese business circles are already worried that this difficulty will eventually affect the United States and bring adverse effects to Japan. Therefore, Ishibashi's active advocacy of developing trade with our country, the Soviet Union, and Southeast Asian countries coincides with the intentions of the Japanese bourgeoisie. Before accepting the formation of the cabinet, Ishibashi repeatedly pointed out that efforts should be made to develop trade between Japan and its neighboring countries.
    Before and after Ishibashi came to power, he made several talks on the new cabinet's future foreign and domestic policies. According to these talks, the new cabinet's future policies will include the following aspects: First, Ishibashi said that his cabinet will not adopt a "leaning to the United States" approach, and demanded to "adjust Japan-US relations"; but on the other hand, he also demanded that the United States eliminate its "misunderstandings" about him, tolerate the restrictions of the United States, and declared that "willing to take the United States as the leader," "Japan will never establish diplomatic relations with Communist China regardless of the free world." Secondly, he said that he would consult with the United States to promote economic relations with our country as much as possible; and he expressed the hope that the United Nations would change its current attitude toward China. Third, he expressed his willingness to hold treaty negotiations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible, develop trade with the Soviet Union, actively develop trade with Southeast Asian countries, and implement technical cooperation with Asian and African countries. Finally, in terms of domestic policy, he said that he would actively support Japan's financial groups. Therefore, on the whole, the new cabinet will not have significant differences from the Hatoyama Cabinet, only some differences in degree. However, the broad masses of the Japanese people are determined to take the path of peace and independence. Whether the weak Ishibashi Cabinet can overcome difficulties and stabilize the political situation in the future Japanese situation will ultimately depend on whether it can not violate the wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people.

    石桥上台的背景和今后日本局势
    庄涛
    日本的鸠山内阁已于本月20日宣布总辞职。新的以石桥湛山为首相的内阁，也已于23日宣誓就职。新内阁由十六名阁员组成。其中外相一职，由自由民主党前任干事长岸信介担任。岸本人是自由民主党前鸠山主流派（即当权派）的首脑之一。这次新阁中除岸外，尚有岸的支持者如法务相中村梅吉、运输相宫泽胤勇、建设相南条德男等人。此外，属于大野伴睦派的通商产业相水田三喜男、厚生相神田博，也是属于前鸠山主流派的。吉田派（吉田茂本人并没有参加自由民主党，只是从党外进行操纵）的池田勇人此次出任新内阁的藏相。新阁中属于石桥派及其支持者的，仅有内阁官房长官石田博英，及属于旧改进党系统的经济企划厅长官宇田耕一、农林相井出一太郎和劳动相松浦周太郎等人。
    从上述石桥内阁的阁员名单来看，可以明显地看出以岸信介为首的自由民主党内的前鸠山主流派，占着举足轻重的重要地位。这一点也说明新的石桥内阁，基本上将是过去的鸠山内阁的继续，不过在对外、对内政策上，将采取比鸠山内阁更为积极的方针。其次，这一阁员名单同时也说明是自由民主党内各派经过剧烈斗争后暂时相互妥协的结果，它包含着从石桥派到吉田派的各派代表人物。新内阁的基础是极不稳定的。日本统治阶级长期来想稳定政局的愿望，毕竟是不易实现的。
    另一方面，石桥本人一向以中日贸易的促进派著称，同时也被看作保守政党内部主张和平共处的老自由主义者。此次鸠山被迫辞职和石桥上台组阁，完全不是偶然的，它客观上反映着日本人民争取和平、独立的斗争，正获得发展。
    鸠山一郎是在1954年年底继吉田茂上台组阁的。当时，他曾扭转了吉田内阁所执行的极端亲美的政策，提出要和我国、苏联恢复正常关系，因此获得了日本人民的支持。但是当鸠山上台以后，就没有忠实地履行自己的诺言。在日本人民的压力下，鸠山内阁虽然在去年6月开始了和苏联的谈判，可是在谈判过程中，始终受着美国帝国主义分子及以吉田为首的日本少数亲美分子的挟持和影响，使谈判况日持久，迟迟不能达成协议。到今年3月下旬以后，苏日双方在伦敦进行的谈判，事实上陷入无限期休会状态。以后由于苏联的让步，从4月末起，苏日双方在莫斯科单独就渔业问题举行了谈判。这一谈判在5月中旬取得协议，双方签订了渔业条约和海上营救协定，并规定这些条约和协定将从苏日和约生效之日或苏日外交关系恢复之日起开始生效。同时，双方又在联合公报中指出：必须尽快地在7月31日以前恢复苏日邦交正常化的谈判。此外，在改进中日关系上，鸠山内阁在这一时期除放宽对双方人员来往的限制及促进中日贸易的某些发展以外，也没有更多的作为，对于中日双方派遣商务代表的问题，始终未予解决。
    鸠山内阁在改进苏日和中日关系中所采取的这一消极态度，再加上在对内政策上又采取了鼓吹修改宪法、重新武装日本，压制日本人民反对美国军事基地的斗争，及压制日本工人为改善本身生活而进行的斗争等措施，使鸠山内阁和自由民主党在人民中的威信大为降低。自由民主党在今年7月日本参议院选举中的失败，就是一个证明。
    今年7月，日本举行改选参议院半数议席（一百二十五席）的选举。在这次选举进行以前，自由民主党为了获得参议院三分之二的多数，以达到修改宪法、加速武装日本的目的，曾想尽了各种办法。但选举的结果表明，社会党、共产党及其他无党派进步议员，由改选前的七十四席增至八十六席，突破了参议院总席数的三分之一，使自由民主党准备操纵议会、修改宪法的意图，至少在今后三年内无法实现。这是日本要求和平和独立的力量的伟大胜利，对于鸠山内阁和自由民主党不能不是一个严重的打击。
    自由民主党在参议院选举中遭受失败以后，鸠山主流派在党内的力量便受到了削弱。党内其他派系就从右面或左面攻击鸠山内阁，群起争权夺利，企图迫使鸠山下台后自己起而执政。这样就形成了最近几个月来日本执政党内部政争的尖锐化。
    大家都知道，自由民主党是在去年11月15日，由自由党和民主党两个保守政党合并而成的，内部包含着各种政见分歧的分子。一般来说，可以分为鸠山主流派和反鸠山主流派两大派系。鸠山主流派是由在自由民主党和鸠山内阁内部掌权的几个人及其支持者组成的。如岸干事长派，大野派，农林相河野派，鸠山直系及大麻唯男派，他们和日本的财阀都有一定的联系，基本上都是支持鸠山的，而且是鸠山内阁政策的决策人。反鸠山主流派内部又可分为两种类型，一类是受亲美分子吉田控制的吉田派，他们的代表人物有池田勇人等。属于已故的旧自由党首脑绪方竹虎派的石井光次郎派，则和这一派接近。另一类则为属于旧改进党系统的松村谦三和三木武夫等一派，他们和日本关西的财阀比较接近，积极地要求发展和我国、苏联以及东南亚各国的贸易，主张对美国采取比较“自主”的立场。石桥派本身力量比较薄弱，不过在旧改进党系统的松村、三木派，河野派，鸠山直系中都有它的支持者。这些派别从各自不同的利益出发，都对鸠山主流派表示不满，进行攻击，要求鸠山下台。
    在上述情况下，为了缓和人民的不满，为了稳定政局和为鸠山主流派取得更多的政治资本，鸠山于10月12日去莫斯科恢复苏日谈判。在鸠山去莫斯科以前，吉田派为了最后阻挠苏日谈判的取得协议，曾纠合石井派等组成“时局恳谈会”，借口领土问题，坚决反对苏日恢复正常关系。但是他们的努力并没有获得成功。由于日本全国人民和自由民主党内大多数派别的支持，谈判在19日达成协议，发表了苏日两国恢复外交关系的联合宣言。12月12日，苏日双方互换苏日联合宣言及其他有关文件的批准书，苏日之间的战争状态从此宣告结束，两国的外交关系也就正式恢复了。鸠山至此急流勇退，正式宣布辞去自由民主党总裁的职位。当时鸠山主流派的目的，是想以岸信介来代替鸠山，实现所谓岸任总裁，大野任副总裁，河野任干事长的计划。吉田派自知为人民所唾弃，不利于竞选总裁，因此支持石井光次郎竞选。松村、三木等旧改进党系统则支持石桥。结果就形成了岸、石井、石桥三人最后争夺总裁的斗争。
    在选举的过程中，第一次岸得二百二十三票，石桥得一百五十一票，石井得一百三十七票。由于谁也没有取得过半数票，就在岸和石桥两人中又举行第二次投票。投票的结果，由于吉田派和石井派转而支持石桥，就使石桥得以二百五十八票对二百五十一票之差，战胜岸而当选总裁。这里吉田派、石井派等对石桥的支持，完全出于这样一种自私的意图：他们清楚地看到岸派在党内有着比较强大的力量，如果岸当选总裁接替鸠山组阁，他们将来的发言权将受到很大的限制；反过来，如果石桥上台，那么他们就可以利用石桥和岸之间的矛盾及石桥本身在党内力量的薄弱来牵制石桥，以形成党内鼎足而立的局面。所以，在最后选举中吉田派、石井派和石桥等派的联合，并不是从政策出发的，而是为了共同抵制岸派。这里就产生了石桥内阁的不稳定性。岸派的大量入阁，吉田派的参加内阁和新阁在诞生过程中的难产，都证明他们之间斗争的剧烈。不过总的来看，从吉田到鸠山，从鸠山到石桥，不能不客观上反映着日本人民争取和平、独立的斗争的发展。
    石桥的上台，在日本的国内外经济关系中，同样也存在着深刻的根据。自从1950年6月美国帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜的战争，并把日本变为侵朝美军的供应基地以后，日本的经济曾在经济军事化的基础上，获得迅速的恢复和发展。1953年7月朝鲜停战协定签订以后，日本经济曾一度爆发生产过剩的危机。不过这一危机并没有持续多久，由于1953年以后日本出口的大量增加，1951年以来日本资本家利用在朝鲜战争和出口贸易中获得的利润大量更新固定资本、增加设备投资，以及日本政府每年继续发出数量可观的军事订货等原因，1954年下半年以来，日本的工矿业生产又迅速地上升。到今年8月，日本的工矿业生产指数已达到1934年至1936年平均生产水平的228.1％，即比战前增加了一又四分之一倍以上。
    和工矿业生产水平的迅速提高比起来，这几年来日本的对外贸易虽然也有着大量增加，但两者之间依旧存在着很大的悬殊。以去年来说，去年日本工矿业的平均生产指数为1934年至1936年平均生产水平的187.7％，但出口贸易的指数仅达到同一时期的71.6％。今年日本的出口贸易虽又有大量增加，但最多也只能恢复到1934至1936年平均水平的90％左右。这一生产和出口之间的极大悬殊，对于对对外贸易有极大依赖的日本来说，不能不成为严重的问题，特别是当日本垄断资本所期望的修改宪法、加速武装日本的计划遭受某些挫败以后更为如此。在国际方面，英、法和以色列发动侵略埃及的战争以后，给英、法帝国主义本身的经济带来了严重的困难。日本实业界的某些人士已在忧虑，这一困难终究将会影响美国而给日本带来不良的影响。因此，石桥积极主张的开展同我国、苏联和东南亚各国的贸易，正和日本资产阶级的意图相吻合。石桥本人在接受组阁以前，就不断指出要努力发展日本和它的邻近各国的贸易。
    石桥上台前后，对新内阁今后的对外、对内政策发表了数次谈话。根据这些谈话来看，新内阁今后的政策将包括以下几个方面：首先，石桥表示他的内阁将不采取“向美国一边倒”的方针，要求“调整日美关系”；但是另一方面，他又要求美国消除对他的“误会”，忍受美国的限制，声明“愿以美国为领导者”，“日本决不会不顾自由世界而同共产党中国建立邦交”。其次，他表示要同美国协商，尽可能地促进同我国的经济关系；他并表示希望联合国改变现在对中国的态度。第三，他表示愿意尽快和苏联举行缔结和约的谈判，开展和苏联的贸易；积极发展和东南亚各国的贸易及同亚非国家实行技术合作。最后在对内政策方面则表示将积极扶持日本的财阀。所以总的来说，新内阁将和鸠山内阁没有显著的区别，只有程度上的某些差别。但是日本广大人民是坚决要求走和平、独立的道路的，基础薄弱的石桥内阁，在今后日本的局势中能否排除困难、稳定政局，最后还是将取决于能否不违背日本广大人民的愿望。
