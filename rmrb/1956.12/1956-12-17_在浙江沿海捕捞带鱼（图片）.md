    Fishing for ribbonfish along the Zhejiang coast
    Winter is the ribbonfish fishing season along the Zhejiang coast. The area around the Shengsi Islands southeast of the Yangtze River estuary is a necessary passage for ribbonfish migrating from north to south. Around the winter solstice, the fish schools are densest, and the output of one fishing season often reaches 600,000 to 700,000 dan [1 dan = 50 kg]. This is a corner of the Shengshan typhoon shelter.

    在浙江沿海捕捞带鱼
    冬天，在浙江沿海是一个捕捞带鱼的季节。长江口东南嵊泗列岛一带是带鱼由北向南必经之路，冬至前后鱼群最密，一汛产量常达六十到七十万担。这是嵊山避风港的一角。　闵立言摄
