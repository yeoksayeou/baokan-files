Since liberation, our country's academic endeavors have shown a vigorous vitality along with the changes in the entire society; especially after the drafting of the Twelve-Year Science and Technology Development Plan, the Party and the government have further adopted a number of wise and timely specific measures to promote the advancement of scientific research. Under the strong support and encouragement of the Party and the government, our scientific workers should strive to put forward and solve some fundamental practical problems encountered in various scientific departments at present, in order to complete the Twelve-Year Science and Technology Development Plan on schedule or ahead of schedule. Now I would like to put forward some superficial personal opinions on several issues related to the study of Chinese legal history, for the consideration of comrades in this field in China.

First, there is the issue of the name of this science. Currently, the names "Chinese Legal History" and "History of Chinese State and Law" are used in parallel, which can easily cause confusion in understanding. Since the two names indicate the same scientific content, it seems that a unified name should be adopted. The legal community has initially held a discussion on this issue, but has not reached a consensus. I personally agree to continue using the old name "Chinese Legal History," because this name has long been in common use in our country, just as we now continue to use the names Constitution, Civil Law, and Criminal Law. Naturally, this is not purely out of deference to habit. The most important reason is that the connotation of the name Legal History that we are accustomed to using includes the history of both state and legal systems. Our continued use of this old name is no different from the new name "History of State and Law." I have consulted several Chinese and Japanese legal history works, such as Chen Guyuan's and Yu Yi's Chinese Legal History, as well as Asai Torao's and Takigawa Masajiro's works on Chinese Legal History and Japanese Legal History. In terms of content, almost everything related to the historical systems of state and law, such as the organization of central and local governments, as well as judicial, civil, criminal, land, currency, finance, transportation, education, military, and examination systems, is included. This situation is obviously different from the way Western bourgeois scholars discuss the history of state and law separately. Since the name "Legal History" has habitually included the content of the history of state and law, we do not seem to need to adopt another foreign translation.

Second, there is the question of the scope of this science, or the so-called object of study. Although I advocate using the old name "Chinese Legal History," it must be pointed out that this science is still an emerging science in the process of creation. From a scientific point of view, we have every reason to say that although there have been some works on Chinese legal history in the past, they have not become a science at all. This is because the application of Marxist-Leninist principles on the development of human society to the study of Chinese historical problems is still a relatively recent matter; and the use of Marxist-Leninist doctrines on state and law to study Chinese legal history is even more recent. Naturally, we cannot completely negate the hard work done by our predecessors in the field of Chinese legal history. At least some of the historical materials that have been compiled are still very useful for our research work today. It is probably impossible for any new science to be created out of thin air without utilizing the research results of predecessors. However, the most fundamental reason why past Chinese legal history did not qualify as a specialized history that meets scientific standards is that bourgeois scholars regarded state and law as a supra-class social phenomenon. Starting from this reactionary idealist erroneous viewpoint, they simply listed various political, legal, economic, financial, monetary, and even land and taxation systems, completely indiscriminately and unrelated to each other, in terms of research objects. Although they also attempted to carve out an independent field from the vast amount of old Chinese historical data to create a specialized history, because they distorted or misunderstood the essence of state and law, and even more because they did not recognize or concealed the relationship between the socio-economic base and the state legal system, the result was still not detached from the nature of old Chinese history, and the distance from the standard of legal specialized history was naturally very far. Every science has its own research object. If it does not have its own unique and clear object, it indicates that it is only a kind of knowledge, or even just some materials, and has not yet developed into a science. We know that before a kind of knowledge or learning is established as a science, its scope is always very broad and cannot be clearly distinguished from other knowledge. The more developed a science is, the finer its classification will be, and therefore its object will be more clearly defined. The Chinese legal history written by bourgeois scholars, due to the excessively broad and complex research objects, encroached on the fields of other specialized histories in social sciences and became a compilation of various unrelated system historical materials.

The object of this science has been basically clarified since the application of Marxist-Leninist doctrines on state and law for research. The scope of our research is mainly divided into the following aspects: (1) to study the process of the emergence of the Chinese state and law and their development and changes in various historical stages; (2) to study the Chinese state system and legal system in specific historical stages and their characteristics; (3) to study the role of the Chinese state and law in different periods; (4) to study the emergence and development of our people's democratic regime and its legal system and the tremendous creative role it has played in various revolutionary historical stages. In summary, the object of study in Chinese legal history is the history of the actual development of various types of specific states and their laws in history since China entered class society.

However, according to my personal preliminary research, I still feel that there are some problems in the object of this science. In the process of creating this science, Soviet jurists have indeed given us a lot of useful inspiration. The "General History of State and Law" compiled by the All-Union Institute of Legal Studies of the Soviet Ministry of Justice has in fact been very inspiring for our research on "Chinese Legal History." Therefore, we have achieved a basic solution to the object problem. Nevertheless, we find that there are still some issues that need to be studied in depth. Only after solving these problems will it be possible to improve the level of the science of "Chinese Legal History."

At present, the scope of research in this science has only been initially determined in a few main aspects, and it has not yet been specifically determined which systems should be included in these main aspects. For example, in terms of the state system, since the central organs of past dynasties were the core organizations through which the ruling class exercised power, it is necessary to determine whether to include all its institutions or only the most important part of them. Secondly, it is necessary to determine whether the local organs of past dynasties should include all its levels of organs, from the first-level local organs to the grassroots organizations. In terms of the legal system, it is necessary to determine whether the central and local judicial organizations of past dynasties should be included in their entirety, or whether the focus should be on the central government while the local government is only briefly mentioned, or even, as is currently the case, the judicial organization of the local government is almost completely untouched. Since the decrees and statutes of past dynasties, such as the "lü, ling, ge, shi" of the Tang Dynasty, the "chi, ling, ge, shi" of the Song Dynasty, and the "lü, li" of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, are different forms reflecting the will of the feudal ruling class, it is necessary to determine whether it is appropriate to limit the study to the "lü."

In addition, the study of Chinese legal history must pay attention to its characteristics, because the history of the emergence and development of the Chinese state and law has its own specific laws on the basis of its general laws. For example, we have not yet fully assigned the unique supervisory system and examination system in Chinese history to the positions they should occupy. The supervisory system grew in the Han Dynasty, flourished in the Tang Dynasty, and continued to be fully developed in the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, with a complete and meticulous system from the central government to the local government. The examination system was also a unique and long-standing system invented by the Chinese feudal ruling class, which played a great role in consolidating their feudal rule. Just looking at a prominent peasant revolutionary leader in modern history, such as Hong Xiuquan, who was once almost misled into its trap, we can see the role this system played in alleviating the class contradictions at that time. In the mid-19th century, Britain even regarded the Chinese examination system as a treasure, absorbed its spirit, and transformed it into a set of bureaucratic institutions that they believed were effective in governance, which is the so-called British civil service system that Western bourgeois administrative scholars have praised. Other similar systems that played a role in the past Chinese class society still need to be studied in depth and excavated. For example, the "mufu" or so-called "shiye" system in the past in China did have a considerable reactionary supporting role in the feudal ruling state organs at that time, but it has not yet been included in the scope of research. Similar systems in other eras may inevitably be omitted. Without research on the above-mentioned unique systems, it would be difficult for us to explain many important issues in Chinese legal history.

Regarding the scope of this science, I believe that two common principles should be followed as the criteria for determining the object and prioritizing the choice. In this way, it can be avoided that the increase or decrease varies from person to person or from material to material. The first principle is that the object of study must be determined according to the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism on state and law. Since the state is the power organ or political organization through which the economically dominant class implements dictatorship, we should take this as the standard when determining the specific content or scope of the state system. We should give corresponding importance to any power organ that has played this dictatorial function in a certain historical period in China, according to the size of its role in class rule at that time. Since law reflects the will of the ruling class, that is, it reflects the will of the state, the determination of the scope of law must be closely linked to the scope of the state, so that they become a complete system in science.

Another principle is that the object of study must be determined in combination with the specific characteristics of the historical development of the Chinese legal system. Our historical situation not only has similarities and differences with other countries in the world; in each historical period in China itself, due to the changes in the socio-economic structure and the development of the class struggle, the state and law, as tools for the ruling class to oppress, often have different systems, or have different forms of expression. Paying attention to this feature can avoid the problem of deviating from historical reality, and will not ignore some important legal systems in our history that should not be ignored. There seem to be several other principles for the scope problem as a standard for determination. How these principles should be formulated still needs to be studied and discussed together.

Third, there is the question of the method of studying this science. The most advantageous condition for studying Chinese legal history today compared to our predecessors is that we have historical materialism as a scientific method. However, there are still problems with the correct grasp of this scientific method at present. The most obvious shortcoming is that since the basic construction of sorting out the legacy of ancestral legal studies has not yet officially started, researchers of this science have failed to possess detailed materials. When analyzing the state and legal systems in various historical periods, they appear simple and superficial, and to a certain extent, even to a large extent, it can be said that they inevitably fall into the habit of dogmatism. Also, using the theory of economic base and superstructure to study Chinese legal history is indeed the most correct way, but the relationship between the base and the superstructure is extremely complex, and the aspects involving the entire society are even more complicated. Therefore, to understand and explain this relationship, it is necessary to appropriately pay attention to the intricate and interactive influence of various prevailing ideologies on the legal views of the ruling class at that time. To give an example, the old laws of Chinese feudal society have always been difficult to distinguish from Confucian ethical and moral ideas, and the criminal laws of past dynasties included many matters that bourgeois scholars believed should not be included in the criminal law. Although the scope of the code was very broad, whenever moral ideas were written in the classics but not included in the code, or the provisions of the code failed to conform to the classics, the effectiveness of the classics was often equal to or even higher than the law. Judging cases according to the meaning of the Spring and Autumn Classics was not only the case in the Han Dynasty, but the actual situation was also the same after the Han Dynasty. In the eyes of bourgeois scholars, this situation is difficult to study. In fact, the legal views of the ruling class and the moral ideas prevailing in society at that time both belong to the category of ideology, and are equally a reflection of the socio-economic base at that time. In order to consolidate its social order, the ruling class will naturally also use moral ideas as a weapon of rule. This level of reasoning is not difficult to explore.

Therefore, in order to avoid falling into the habit of dogmatism in our study of Chinese legal history, we must correctly understand the spiritual essence of Marxism, rather than mechanically applying formulas. The current research methods often limit the understanding of the superstructure to legal and political viewpoints and the corresponding legal system, and rarely or do not pay attention to the role of other aspects of social ideology on the legal system. Also, the study of Chinese legal history must pay attention to another feature, that is, the provisions of the code often differ greatly from the actual handling methods. If judgments are made solely on the basis of the code without combining it with the actual implementation of the ruling class at that time, then the facts may be completely wrong. Moreover, not all Chinese codes were current laws at that time. Sometimes, although a legal provision has been abolished, even after the establishment of the code, it was not allowed to take effect. However, when compiling the code, either for reference or because they did not dare to delete the ancestral constitution, they still retained that old legal provision. For example, according to Chen Yinque's argument, the "Six Codes" compiled in the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty was regarded as "a kind of book that is convenient for reference in the Tang Dynasty's administration, and it did not set up officials to divide duties and implement political affairs according to the Zhouguan system." Another example is the so-called "Eight Deliberations" system in the old law. Some people believe that it has been preserved in the criminal codes of all dynasties since the Tang Dynasty, and the criminal laws of the Qing Dynasty have also retained this system. In fact, the Great Qing Code had long declared that the "Eight Deliberations" provision should not be used as a model. Although this provision still exists, it has not been implemented, and the edict of the sixth year of Yongzheng is cited as an argument. The above two views cannot naturally be regarded as the final conclusion. But it can be proved from this that the study of Chinese legal history cannot be separated from the correct principle of theory linking practice.

Fourth, there is the question of collecting and sorting out historical materials for this science. The existence of a written code in China can at least be said to have started with Li Kui's "Fa Jing" of Wei in the Warring States period. The legacy of legal studies in our history is indeed very rich. Previous researchers of the so-called learning of statutes and institutions already had the view that the Six Classics were all history, and had already sorted out many historical materials related to the legal system. However, today we use the method of historical materialism to study Chinese legal history. Not only must all the "Twenty-Four Histories," "Two Comprehensive Mirrors," "Nine Comprehensive Histories," "Five Records of Events from Beginning to End," and even other separate and miscellaneous histories totaling no less than tens of thousands of volumes be the scope of collecting materials, but also all classics, books, collections, various documents and archives, periodicals, newspapers, meeting minutes, case explanations, investigation reports, and so-called unofficial histories are all objects for our collection of materials. Researching history depends entirely on evidence. If we want to do a good job in the research of this specialized history, we must start with the systematic collection and collation of historical materials. This work must be started early, with leadership and in a step-by-step manner. Here, I would like to put forward the following specific suggestions: (1) Reprint important legal codes of past dynasties and legal history works that have gone out of print. From Qin to Sui after the Fa Jing, each dynasty had its own written code, but none of them have been passed down. What is now passed down is the code from the Tang Dynasty onwards. However, according to the current situation in the old book market, these codes are difficult to buy or buy in full, and have almost become antique treasures. For example, "Tang Law Subcommentary," "Song Criminal Statute," "Yuan Dianzhang," "Ming Law Collection of Explanations," "Great Qing Law Cases," "Imperially Approved Great Qing Criminal Law," and important monographs that have gone out of print, etc., should be reprinted by the national publishing institutions to meet the urgent needs of current higher political and law schools for research and teaching. (2) Annotate or translate more important codes and important historical books related to the legal system. The Legislative Affairs Bureau of the State Council has already started work in this regard, and has published an annotation of the Criminal Law Records of the Draft History of the Qing Dynasty, which is a diligent and practical work that has made a valuable preliminary contribution to the legal community. Sorting out historical materials should start from this aspect, which is indeed grasping the most basic link in the research work of legal history. It is hoped that more people will be concentrated to do this work and complete the selected annotation plan as soon as possible. (3) Edit a series of Chinese legal history materials. This is a huge project, and how to do it requires careful study and planning. At present, various political and law schools are scattered and working alone in order to meet teaching needs, each doing its own thing, which is not economical in terms of manpower and material resources. This fundamental construction of academic long-term planning should undoubtedly be planned as a whole by the national science leading organs, mobilizing the forces in this area across the country to work together. Here, I cannot help but express my ardent expectations for the early birth of the Law Research Institute of the Academy of Sciences! (4) Compile a catalog of books and materials related to legal history in the libraries of various schools and institutions across the country. This work is relatively the easiest to do and is very much needed at present. I suggest starting from Beijing first. The method is for each library to compile its own catalog of books, and each institution and school should first sort out its own collection in this area, compile a catalog and circulate it to each other, so that people who study this science can understand the collection situation and have the convenience of timely reference.

Finally, I will briefly talk about the attitude towards our country's legal heritage. Chairman Mao has long taught us that we should learn to use the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to earnestly study Chinese history. We need various specialized histories, and we also need specialized histories about our country's legal system. To understand the development law of the Chinese state and law, we must study it from its occurrence and development in history, otherwise it will be difficult to have a correct understanding. The "Chinese legal system" is one of the five famous legal systems in the world, which has had a great influence on East Asian countries. The oldest code we have is the "Fa Jing" of Li Kui in the Warring States period, which is more than two thousand years ago. Even the most complete Tang Law that has been left to us is 1,300 years old. We see that the Soviet academic community is still putting a lot of effort into studying the code promulgated during the feudal period of the Kiev state eight hundred years ago - "Russkaya Pravda," and has devoted a lot of research work to the versions of this ancient feudal code. They not only treat their motherland's legal heritage in this way, but also continuously conduct in-depth and systematic research on the Code of Hammurabi and ancient Babylonian law, a Babylonian emperor more than 3,700 years ago, using new viewpoints, and publish specialized works on this code. Chinese legal scientists today also have the responsibility to use the scientific methods of Marxism-Leninism to sort out and summarize this part of the cultural heritage of the motherland, reveal its true face and essence, and contribute it as a new contribution from the legal community of New China to the world's cultural treasury. Also, the focus of our long-term research should be placed on ancient times, but now it should focus on the history of the legal system since the May Fourth Movement. Although our New China was declared established in 1949, the creation of our people's democratic regime has a long history. The Chinese people have used this regime to wage a long and arduous struggle against the enemy, and finally achieved a historic victory. The history of the people's legal system in this stage should be sorted out and summarized, so that it becomes the most glorious page of this specialized history; moreover, this is of great significance to the national liberation movements and the establishment of people's democratic regimes in various countries around the world, especially in Asia and Africa.

    关于研究中国法制史的几个问题
    戴克光
    解放以来，我们国家的学术事业随着整个社会面貌的改变，突现出十分蓬勃的生机；特别是在十二年科学远景规划草案制定以后，党和政府更进一步采取了若干英明而及时的具体措施，来推动科学研究工作前进。在党和政府这种有力支持和鼓舞之下，我们科学工作者当努力以赴，提出并解决目前各个科学部门所接触到的一些根本性的实际问题，以期如期或提前完成十二年科学远景规划。现在我愿就有关中国法制史研究工作的几个问题，提出个人一些粗浅的意见，就教于国内这方面的同志。
    第一，是关于这门科学的名称问题。目前，“中国法制史”和“中国国家与法的历史”两个名称并用，很容易引起认识上的混淆；既然两个名称标明同一科学内容，似乎就应该采用一个统一的名称。目前法学界对于这个问题已初步座谈了一次，尚没有取得一致的意见。我个人赞成沿用“中国法制史”这个旧名，因为这个名称在我们国内久已通用，正如我们现在沿用宪法、民法、刑法这些名称一样。自然这并不是纯由迁就习惯出发，最重要的理由，是由于我们所惯用的法制史这个名称的内涵，正是包括国家与法律两方面制度的历史而言，我们沿用这个旧名并不与“国家与法的历史”这个新名有何两样。我曾经翻阅了若干种中文和日文的法制史著作，例如陈顾远，郁嶷诸人的中国法制史以及日人浅井虎夫，泷川政次郎等人所著的支那法制史和日本法制史，在内容方面，所有关于国家与法的制度历史，如中央和地方的组织以及司法、民刑法、土地、货币、财政、交通、教育、军事、考试等等制度几无所不包。这种情形显然与西方资产阶级学者把国家与法的历史区分开来论述，有所不同。“法制史”这个名称既然在习惯上已经包括了国家与法的历史的内容，我们似乎没有另外采用一个外来译名的必要。
    第二，是关于这门科学的范围问题，或者所谓研究的对象问题。尽管我主张采用“中国法制史”这个旧名，但必须指出这门科学仍然是一种新兴而在创造过程中的科学。就科学观点而论，我们完全有理由可以说，过去虽然曾有一些中国法制史的著作，但根本没有成为一种科学。这由于以马克思列宁主义关于人类社会发展的原理来研究中国历史问题，还是比较晚近的事；而运用马克思列宁主义关于国家与法的学说来研究中国法制史，那更是很近的事。自然，我们对于前人在中国法制史方面所付的辛勤劳动，未可一概抹杀，至少其中有些已整理出来的史料，对于我们今天的研究工作，仍然很有用处。任何一种新的科学，如不利用前人研究的成果，而凭空创造，那恐怕是绝没有可能的事。但过去的中国法制史所以够不上称为合乎科学标准的专门史，最根本的原因，是由于资产阶级学者把国家与法看成一种超阶级的社会现象，他们从这种反动的唯心论错误观点出发，表现在研究对象方面，就只是把各种政治、法律、经济、财政、货币乃至土地、税收等等制度，完全不分青红皂白，互不相关地罗列出来；虽然他们也企图从浩如烟海的中国旧史资料里面，划出一部分独立的领域来创造一种专门史，而由于他们歪曲了或误解了国家与法的实质，更由于他们不认识或掩盖了社会经济基础与国家法制中间的关系，所以结果仍然没有脱离中国旧史性质的范围，距离法制专史的标准，自然十分遥远。各门科学都有自己的研究对象，如果它没有自己的独特而明确的对象，那就表明它只是一种知识，甚至于只是一些材料，而还没有发展成为一种科学。我们知道凡是一种知识或学问，在它未成立为科学以前，范围总是很广，和旁的知识分不清楚。科学愈发达，它的分类就愈细密，因而它的对象也就格外确定。资产阶级学者所著的中国法制史由于研究对象过于广泛而庞杂，侵占了社会科学中其他各种专门史的领域，就成为互不联系的各种制度史料的汇编。
    这门科学的范围自从运用马克思列宁主义关于国家与法的学说来进行研究以后，它的对象基本上已很明确。我们所要研究的范围主要是分为以下几个方面：（1）研究中国国家与法的产生和它们在各个历史阶段里面的发展变化的过程；（2）研究在特定历史阶段里面的中国国家制度和法律制度以及它们所具有的特点；（3）研究中国国家与法在不同时期所发生的作用；（4）研究我们的人民民主政权及其法制的产生、发展和它在各个革命历史阶段中所发挥的巨大创造性的作用。总起来说：中国法制史所研究的对象，是从中国进入阶级社会以来，历史上各种类型的具体国家和它的法律实际发展的历史。
    但是根据我个人初步的研究，仍然感觉到这门科学在对象方面还存在着一些问题。在创造这门科学的过程里面，苏联法学家确是给予了我们很多有益的启发，苏联司法部全苏法学研究所编写的“国家与法的通史”，事实上对于我们研究“中国法制史”就有很大的启发。因此，在对象问题上，我们已经取得了基本上的解决。尽管如此，我们发现仍有若干问题须要深入研究。只有在解决了这些问题以后，才有可能提高“中国法制史”这门科学的水平。
    现在这门科学的研究范围，只是在几个主要方面才初步确定下来，而在这几个主要方面内究竟应该包括那些制度，还没有具体确定。例如，在国家制度方面，历代中央机关既是统治阶级行使权力的核心组织，那么究竟是应该包括其全部机构，还是只限于其中最主要的一部分机构，这是须要确定的第一点。其次，历代地方机关是否包括它的各级机关，从地方的一级机关一直到基层组织是否皆在其内，这是须要确定的第二点。在法律制度方面，历代的中央和地方司法组织是否应包括其全部，或只是详于中央而略于地方，或甚至如目前情形一样几乎完全不涉及地方的司法组织，这是须要确定的第三点。历代的法令典章，如唐代的律令格式，宋代的敕令格式，明清的律例等，既是反映封建统治阶级意志的不同形式，如果只限于律的研究是否恰当，这是须要确定的第四点。
    此外，研究中国法制史必须注意它的特点，这由于中国国家与法的产生和发展的历史，在它的一般性规律的基础上面，还有它的特殊性的规律。举例来说：我们目前对于中国历史上独特的监察制度和考试制度，还完全没有赋与它们所应占有的位置。监察制度成长于两汉，全盛于李唐，延续大备于宋元明清，从中央到地方有一套完备周密的体制。而考试制度亦为中国封建统治阶级所发明的一种独特而悠久的制度，对于巩固它们的封建统治曾经发挥了很大的作用。只要看像近代史中一位杰出的农民革命领袖如洪秀全其人，尚且一度几乎误入它的圈套，就可知这个制度在缓和当时的阶级矛盾上曾经起过的作用。十九世纪中叶的英国，还把中国的考试制度奉为至宝，吸取了它的精神，改建成一套它们认为统治得力的官僚机构，也就是后来西方资产阶级行政学者们所津津乐道的所谓英国文官制度。其他类此的一些制度，在过去中国阶级社会里面曾经起过作用的，还须深入研究，进行发掘。例如中国过去的幕府或所谓师爷制度，当时在封建统治国家机构里面，确曾有过相当不小的反动配合作用，尚未放进研究的范围。其他各个时代中类似的制度，恐怕难免有所遗漏。对于上述这些独特制度缺少研究，那我们就很难说明中国法制史中的许多重要问题。
    关于这门科学的范围问题，我认为应该遵循两个共同原则，作为确定对象和轻重取舍的标准。这样，就可避免目前因人或因材料而异其增减。第一个原则是：必须根据马克思列宁主义关于国家与法的基本原理来确定研究的对象。国家既然是经济上占统治地位的阶级实行专政的权力机关或政治组织，那么我们决定国家制度的具体内容或范围，就应该以此为标准。凡是在中国某一历史时期中曾经发挥这种专政职能的权力机关，我们就应按照它当时在阶级统治上所起作用的大小而给与它以相应的轻重不同的位置。法律既然是反映统治阶级的意志，那也就是反映国家的意志，所以确定法律范围必须与国家的范围密切联系起来，使它们成为科学上的一种完整的体系。
    再有一个原则，就是必须结合中国法制历史发展的具体特点来确定研究的对象。我们的历史情况不但与世界上其他各国互有同异；就在中国自己各个历史时期里面，由于社会经济结构的变化和阶级斗争形势的发展，作为统治阶级压迫工具的国家与法，也常常各有其不同的体制，或者是有不同的表现形式。注意到这种特点，就可避免脱离历史实际的毛病，也不至于忽略了我们历史上所不应忽略的一些重要法制。对于范围问题似乎还须有若干原则，作为确定的标准。这些原则究竟应当怎样制定，还有待于共同研究和讨论。
    第三，是关于研究这门科学的方法问题。今天研究中国法制史比前人最有利的一个条件，就是我们有了历史唯物主义这个科学方法。但是对于这个科学方法的正确掌握，在目前并不是没有问题的。最明显的一个缺点，是由于整理祖国法学遗产的基本建设工作，目前还没有正式开始，研究这门科学的人未能详细占有材料，对各个历史时期中的国家与法律制度进行分析时，就显得简单浮泛，在一定程度上，甚至于在很大程度上，也可以说不免流于教条主义的习气。还有，运用经济基础和上层建筑的学说来研究中国法制史，确是一个最正确的途径，但是基础与上层建筑中间的关系，则极为复杂，牵涉整个社会的方面更是头绪纷繁，因此理解并说明这种关系，必须适当地注意到当时流行的各种意识形态对于统治阶级法律观点所发生的错综交互的影响。举一个例来说：中国封建社会的旧律向来与儒家的伦理道德思想很难划清界限，中国历朝刑律包括了资产阶级学者们认为不应列入刑律之内的许多事体。法典范围虽是很广，而凡道德思想之著于经义而未被法典包括，或者法典所定并未能符合经义的，则经义的效力往往等于法律，或且高于法律。据春秋经义以决狱，不只是汉代如此，汉代以后实际情形也是如此。在资产阶级学者看来，这种情形是难于研究的。其实，统治阶级的法律观点和当时社会上流行的道德思想，同属于意识形态的范畴，也正同样是当时的社会经济基础的反映。统治阶级为了巩固其社会秩序，自然会同样拿道德思想作为统治的武器。这层道理并不难探究。
    因此，我们研究中国法制史为了避免流于教条习气，就必须正确体会马克思主义的精神实质，而不是机械地套用公式。目前的研究方法对于上层建筑的理解往往局限于法律的和政治的观点及与其相适应的法制，而很少或没有注意到其他方面的社会意识形态对于法制所发生的作用。还有，研究中国法制史须要注意到另一特点，即法典条文所规定的往往与实际处理办法大有出入，如果单凭法典条文而不结合当时统治阶级实际执行的情形，遽下论断，那就可能事实全非。并且，中国各种法典就在当时，也并不都是现行法。有时一种律文虽然已经废止，虽在法典成立后也并没有叫它发生效力，然而编纂法典的时候，或因留备参考，或因不敢删削祖宗成宪，仍然把那种旧律文保留在内。例如，唐代开元时所修六典，据陈寅恪先生的论断，认为这部六典在唐代行政上只是“成为一种便于征引之类书，并非依其所托之周官体裁，以设官分职实施政事”。再如旧律中所谓“八议”之制，也有人认为从唐代以降，历代刑法典皆予以保存，清代历次刑律，也都保留这个制度，实则大清会典早经声明八议之条，不可为训，虽仍有这种条文，并未实行，并且引雍正六年的上谕，作为论证。关于以上两种看法，自然还不能认为是最后结论。但从这里面可以证明，研究中国法制史，同样不能须臾离开理论联系实际这一正确原则。
    第四，是关于搜集和整理这门科学的史料问题。中国之有成文法典，至少可以说是从战国时魏李悝的“法经”开始。我们历史中的法学遗产确是十分丰富的。前人研究所谓典章制度的学问，已有六经皆史的看法，且已整理出许多有关法制的史料；但我们今天用历史唯物主义的方法来研究中国法制史，不仅是所有二十四史、两通鉴、九通、五纪事本末，乃至其他别史杂史等总计不下数万卷，必须是搜集材料的范围，并且所有经子集部与各种文书档案、期刊报纸、会议纪录、判例解释、调查报告以及所谓稗官野史等等，通统都是我们搜集资料的对象。研究历史全凭证据。我们要做好这种专门史的研究工作，首先须从系统搜集和整理史料做起，无待烦言。这种工作必须及早有领导有步骤地着手进行。在这里，愿意提出以下几种具体建议：（1）翻印历代重要法典和已经绝版的有关法制史著作。法经以后从秦到隋，历代虽各有它的成文法典，然皆不传，现在所传的，是唐代以下的法典。但目前根据旧书市场情况，这些法典很难买到或买全，几乎成为古董珍品。例如唐律疏义，宋刑统，元典章，明律集解，大清律例，钦定大清刑律及绝版的重要论著等，须由国家出版机构加以翻印，供应目前高等政法院校研究上和教学上的迫切需要。（2）注解或翻译较重要的法典和有关法制的重要史书。现在国务院法制局在这方面已经着手进行，并且已经出版了清史稿刑法志的注解，这是一种辛勤而实际的工作，对法学界有可贵的初步贡献。整理史料先从这方面做起，确是抓住了法制史研究工作的一个最基本的环节。希望能集中更多一些人来做这一工作，早日完成所选定的注解计划。（3）编辑中国法制史资料丛刊。这是一个巨大的工程，如何做法须要仔细研究，定出计划。目前各个政法院校为了应付教学需要，分散单干，各搞一套，人力物力皆不经济。学术上这种百年大计的基本建设，毫无疑问地应该由国家科学领导机关全盘筹划，调动全国这方面的力量，通力进行。在这里我对于科学院法学研究所的及早诞生，不胜寄予殷切的期待！（4）编制全国各学校和机关图书馆所藏有关法制史书籍和资料的目录。这个工作比较最容易做而又是当前十分需要的。我建议首先从北京做起。办法由各图书馆自编所藏的书目，每个机关学校自己先清理一下这方面的家底，编好目录互相传看，使得研究这门科学的人得到了解收藏情况和及时参考的便利。
    最后简单谈一下关于对待我国法学遗产的态度问题。毛主席早经教导我们说，要学会运用马克思主义的立场、观点与方法，认真研究中国历史。我们需要各种专门史，同样需要关于我国法制的专门史。要认识中国国家与法的发展规律就必须从它在历史上的发生与发展来研究，要不然就很难有正确的理解。“中国法系”是世界上著名的五大法系之一，对东亚各国曾经发生过很大的影响。我们最古的法典以战国时李悝的法经而论，远在两千多年以前。即以遗留下来最完整的唐律而言，距离现在也有一千三百年之久。我们看到苏联学术界对于他们八百年前基辅国家封建时期所颁布的法典——“罗斯真理”，现在仍然很下功夫从事研究，并且对于这个古老封建法典的版本，还专心致志地做了很多考订校勘的研究工作。他们不仅对于其祖国法学遗产是这样对待，同时对于三千七百多年以前的一个巴比伦皇帝哈漠拉比法典和古巴比伦法，同样运用新的观点，不断做了深入而系统的研究，发表了关于这个法典的专门著作。中国法律科学工作者今天同样有责任运用马克思列宁主义的科学方法，整理总结祖国这部分文化遗产，把它的真面目和本质揭示出来，作为新中国法学界对世界文化宝库的一种新贡献。还有，我们长期研究的重点，应该放在古代，现在则应着重于五四运动以后这段法制的历史。我们新中国虽在1949年宣告成立，而我们人民民主政权的创建，则早已具有长期的历史。中国人民运用这个政权和敌人作过长期艰苦的斗争，而最后终于取得历史性的胜利。应当把这一阶段关于人民法制的历史整理总结出来，使其成为这种专门史的最光辉的一页；而且，这对于当前世界各国特别是亚非各国民族解放运动和建立人民民主政权，也是具有巨大意义的。
