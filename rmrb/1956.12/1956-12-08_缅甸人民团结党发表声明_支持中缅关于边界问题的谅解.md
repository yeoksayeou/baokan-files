Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 7th. The Burmese People's Unity Party recently issued a statement saying that it fully supports the friendly face-to-face discussions between Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League Chairman U Nu and Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing on the Sino-Burmese border issue.

The statement said: "The suggestion regarding (Burma's withdrawal from) Pianma, Gawlang, and Gulang is conducive to the mutual interests of both countries and is just. These suggestions will help further consolidate and develop the friendly relations between Burma and China." The statement advocates the prompt formation of a border committee to implement the agreements reached between the two countries.

The statement said that currently, some people are attempting to create divisions and disagreements between Burma and China on the border issue. Certain pro-Western elements are striving "in every possible way to undermine the interests of both countries, and therefore the people must unite to eliminate these dangers."

The statement also urged the Burmese government to take clear and decisive action to deal with these elements.

　　支持中缅关于边界问题的谅解
    新华社仰光7日电　缅甸人民团结党最近发表声明说，它完全拥护反法西斯人民自由同盟主席吴努同周恩来总理在北京就中缅边界问题所举行的亲切的面对面的讨论。
    这篇声明说：“关于（缅甸撤出）片马、岗房和古浪三个地方的建议有助于两国的相互利益，并且是公正的。这些建议将有助于进一步巩固和发展缅中两国之间的友好关系。”这篇声明主张尽快的组成一个边境委员会来贯彻两国之间达成的各项协议。
    声明说，目前有些人正企图在边界问题上制造缅甸同中国之间的分裂和分歧。某些亲西方的分子正在努力“千方百计地设法破坏两国的利益，因此人民必须团结起来，清除这些危险”。
    这篇声明还敦促缅甸政府采取明确而果断的行动来对付这些分子。
