Title: "Adapt to Local Conditions"

　　"Adapt to the time and adapt to the place" are two extremely profound idioms that ancient people summarized through long-term struggle. In today's language, it means that all things must be specifically analyzed, and all work must be carried out according to different times, places, and conditions.

　　Because these two idioms are very useful to us, many people often use them to criticize work. For example, this year in some areas of Hebei Province, in the process of promoting the planting of White Horse Tooth corn, some cadres at the lower levels did not specifically study the land and farming conditions, and forcibly promoted this crop. Therefore, some people criticized in this way: "Not adapting to local conditions." This criticism cannot be said to be unfair.

　　However, in my conversations with technical cadres in two counties, they did not think this criticism was correct. They said: Many cadres at the lower levels are complaining about the phrase "adapt to local conditions."

　　I was very surprised and asked what the reason was. They said: "You don't know, many technical cadres and commune cadres at the lower levels had never seen White Horse Tooth corn before, and they didn't know its characteristics at all. Who knows whether it is suitable for fertile land or barren land? Suitable for mountains or suitable for water? Since the superiors ordered its promotion, not promoting it would result in blame and punishment, with very little specific guidance. Everyone followed the trend, planting it regardless of whether the farmers were willing or not. Now that some places have failed, they say it is 'not adapting to local conditions.' May I ask what exactly is adapting to local conditions?"

　　Indeed, when a person knows nothing about something, there is no way to talk about "adaptation." "Adaptation" means coordinating two things that can be combined so that they do not contradict each other. To do this kind of combination work, it is impossible without understanding the characteristics of both sides. If lower-level cadres know nothing about White Horse Tooth corn, how can they talk about adapting to local conditions?

　　To deploy work without typical demonstrations, without specifically explaining the situation and policies, without clearly defining the scope of work and policy boundaries, only blindly pursuing numbers and tasks, resulting in bad work at the lower levels, this phenomenon is not limited to the White Horse Tooth corn issue in Hebei. For example, the industrial sector once manufactured many "hanging plows" for farmers, the commercial sector also transported high-heeled shoes to mountainous areas, and the personnel departments arbitrarily placed talent. Are these all adapting to the time, place, and person? Of course, the cadres at the lower levels also have responsibilities for these things, but the cadres at the higher levels only decide on tasks and allocate numbers without specifically studying the work and providing in-depth guidance, and even abuse their power to set deadlines for implementation, leaving the lower levels with no room for flexibility. As a result, things are ruined, but they do not first blame themselves, but push all the responsibility to the lower levels. Is this fair? Recently, some local leading organs have begun to examine their own subjectivism and bureaucracy, which is a good phenomenon. "Adaptation" is the common responsibility of upper and lower levels. If the higher-level organs only know how to blame others and not blame themselves, then your blame is just a cover for your own bureaucracy.

### “因地制宜”

    “因地制宜”
    霍藜
    因时制宜，因地制宜，这是古代人民经过长期斗争所总结出来的两句极为深刻的成语，用现在的话来说，就是对一切事情都要进行具体分析，一切都要根据不同的时间、地点、条件来进行工作。
    由于这两句成语对于我们很有用，因此许多人常拿这两句成语来批评工作。比如今年河北省有些地方在推广种植白马牙玉米当中，下面有些干部没有具体地研究土地和耕作条件，硬性地推广了这种作物，于是有些人就这样批评：“没有因地制宜”。这种批评不能不说是公道的。
    但是，我在同两个县的技术干部谈话中，他们却不认为这个批评正确，他们说：下面的许多干部都在埋怨“因地制宜”这句话。
    我听了很奇怪，便问这是什么原因？他们说：“你不知道，我们下面很多技术干部和社干部过去都没有见过白马牙，也根本就不知道它的特性，谁知它是宜肥呢，宜瘠呢？宜山呢，宜水呢？既然上面命令推广，不推广就受责备、受处罚，很少具体指导，大家一股风，不管农民愿意不愿意就种下去了，现在有些地方失败了，又说是‘不因地制宜’，试问究竟什么是因地制宜呢？”
    的确，当一个人对于一件事物毫无所知的时候，是谈不到什么“制宜”的。所谓“制宜”就是要把两个可以结合的东西互相协调起来，不使互相矛盾。要做这种结合工作，不了解双方的特性是办不到的。下级干部对白马牙毫无所知，哪还谈得到什么因地制宜？
    布置一种工作，不经过典型示范，不具体地交代情况和政策，不划清工作的范围和政策界限，只盲目追求数字和任务，结果下面工作弄坏，这种现象又何止河北白马牙这一个问题？比方说工业部门曾为农民制造了很多“挂犁”，商业部门把高跟鞋也运往山区，人事部门随便安置人材，难道这都是因时因地因人制宜吗？固然这些事情下面的干部也有责任，但是上面干部只决定任务、分配数字，而不具体研究工作，深入指导，甚至滥用权力限期执行，使下级毫无伸缩的余地，结果把事情弄坏了而不首先自责，却把一切责任都推到下面，这难道是公平的吗？最近有些地方领导机关已开始检查自己的主观主义和官僚主义，这是很好的现象。“制宜”是上下级共同的责任，如果上级机关只会责人不会责己，那末你的责备只不过是对自己的官僚主义的一种掩饰。
