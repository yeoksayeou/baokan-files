Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, December 5th: Many agricultural cooperatives in the Nanping Special District, a mountainous area in northern Fujian Province, have achieved high yields of 1,000 jin of rice per mu.

	This year, Jianyang County agricultural cooperatives planted over 80,000 mu of intercropping rice. Most of these fields were mountain ridge terraces that previously only grew one crop of rice per year. After switching to intercropping rice this year, and due to processing, increased fertilization, and technical reforms, over 1,200 mu of land achieved an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu for both early and late rice crops. The highest yield per unit area reached over 1,400 jin, and the lowest was 1,040 jin, more than doubling the average yield of intercropping rice in the area, and increasing the yield by four to five times compared to the original single-season rice cultivation. This year, Pucheng County agricultural cooperatives expanded the double-cropping rice planting area by more than double compared to last year, and 528 mu of land with 1,000 jin of rice has already been discovered. One mu of intercropping rice in the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in this county achieved an average yield of 1,800 jin for the early and late seasons, setting a record for the highest yield of intercropping rice in the mountainous area.

	Guangze, Shaowu, Jianning, Taining, and other grain-producing counties in this special district have also successively discovered large areas of high-yield fields producing 1,000 jin of rice per mu.

　　许多千斤稻丰产田
　  在福建北部山区出现
    新华社福州5日电　福建省北部山区南平专区许多农业社获得千斤稻高额产量。
    建阳县农业社今年种植间作稻八万多亩，这些田大部分是过去只种一季水稻的山垅梯田。今年改种间作稻后，由于进行了加工加肥和技术改革，早晚两季稻平均产量达到千斤水平的有一千二百多亩，其中单位面积产量最高的达到一千四百多斤，最低的也有一千零四十斤，比当地间作稻平均产量提高两倍多；比原来种植单季稻产量增加四倍到五倍。浦城县农业社今年双季稻种植面积比去年扩大一倍多，已发现的千斤稻面积有五百二十八亩。这个县的曙光农业社的一亩间作稻，早晚两季平均产量达到一千八百斤，创造了山区间作稻产量最高纪录。
    这个专区的光泽、邵武、建宁、泰宁等产粮县份也陆续发现大面积千斤稻高产田。
