	“Double Wedding” – A Song of People
	Qiuyang
	On a snowy winter night, after a busy day, returning home, sitting around the stove under the lamp, teasing the children and chatting; the light and warmth create a scene of tranquil happiness. The stove may not be burning very strongly, so add a shovel of coal, and in a moment, flames rise up, making the room feel like spring. Coal – it brings so much joy to people! However, who knows how much sweat each small piece of coal has been soaked in? And how many joys and sorrows do the coal miners have in their stories?
	In "Double Wedding," the playwright Ke Fu sketches a vivid and lively picture of the lives of coal miners.
	When we are used to seeing some formulaic so-called "industrial plays," this play brings at least a fresh feeling to people. This play also reflects the struggle between the advanced and the conservative in real life, but this struggle is not embodied through disagreements on a certain production technology issue, as in some plays; the author depicts people, praises people, and from this, shows the struggle between the advanced and the backward. This struggle therefore has a broader significance: it is not manifested in a certain technical problem, but in the entire world view – whether or not the assessment of "people" is correct.
	Due to various different and complex reasons, some of the characters in the play have doubts about fate and about people's ability to change their own destiny, thus forming tragic lives to varying degrees: Aunt He almost interrupted her love life; Mine Director Chen Zigao was eventually dismissed from his job. For a certain period, life was harsh for them. However, the keynote of the whole play is a positive and upward force, a joyful feeling of people changing their own destiny. However, it is precisely because of the depiction of the darker aspects that the keynote is more contrasting and therefore more prominent. This is not to say that this play relies solely on technical arrangements to achieve this effect. The audience in the theater is sometimes sad and sometimes happy, and finally immersed in joy again, mainly because this play shows the complex and tortuous aspects of real life, and the power that is the mainstream in life.
	To say that this play is full of life is not to say that the author depicts some common characters in this play, or even lists some trivial life details, but that he vividly shows through stage actions and stage images that people – this is such a proud and precious title; and how huge and indestructible a force people can exert in changing nature and other objective environments. Therefore, the whole play is permeated with one of the most important topics in our lives: respect people, care for people, and fight to change people's destiny and make it more beautiful!
	Therefore, it breaks through the limitations of the subject matter it depicts and gains resonance in a wider range! This is what sets it apart from the general so-called "industrial plays."
	Finally, let's talk about some technical issues. I don't know if the author did this consciously: I always feel that this play partially embodies some of the traditional comedic treatment methods in ancient Chinese opera, such as highlighting a comedic character (Wang Shouyi) through repeated actions; especially in the last scene, the extremely compact arrangement of the characters entering and exiting the stage makes people feel like they are reuniting with old friends, which is very fresh, but there is a pattern to follow, not the kind of "suspension" that tries to win by abruptness alone. I think this is worth affirming. It is also a topic worth studying carefully.
	Recently, foreign plays and classical plays have been given more weight on the Beijing drama stage. Given the relative lack of plays reflecting real life, the performance of "Double Wedding" and its achievements should be regarded as gratifying.

    “双婚记”——人的赞歌
    丘扬
    当大雪纷飞的冬夜里，一天忙碌之余，回到家里，灯下围炉小坐，逗逗孩子、谈谈闲话；光明、温暖，正是一片静谧幸福的景象。炉子也许不大旺了，加一铲煤下去，片刻火光四起，室内如春。煤——带给了人们多少快乐啊！然而，有谁知道每一小块煤曾经浸透过多少人的汗水？而采煤的人们又有多少悲欢和辛酸的故事？
    剧作家柯夫在“双婚记”里，却勾出了一幅煤矿工人生活的鲜明生动的图画。
    当我们习见于一些公式化的所谓“工业戏”的时候，这部戏带给人们起码是清新的感觉。这部戏，同样地也反映了现实生活中先进同保守之间的斗争，但这个斗争，不是像有些戏那样通过对于某个生产技术问题上的意见不一致而体现出来的；作者描写了人，赞美了人，而从这里，表现出了先进同落后的斗争。这斗争因而有了更深广的意义：不是表现在某个技术问题上的，而是表现在整个的世界观——对“人”的正确与否的估计上的。
    由于诸种不同的、复杂的原因，剧中的人物有的对于命运、对于人们自己改变命运的能力有所怀疑，因而形成了不同程度的悲剧生活：何大嫂几乎中断了自己的爱情生活；陈子高矿长终于被撤销了自己的工作。一定时期内，生活对他们说来是严酷的。但，构成全剧基调的是一股积极、向上的力量，是一种人们在改变自己命运的过程中欢快的感觉。然而，也正因为有着晦暗方面的描绘，就越使得这基调有了对比，因而更为突出。这并不是说，这部戏是单纯依靠着技巧的安排来取得这样的效果的，剧场中的观众时悲时喜，最后复又沉浸在欢快之中，主要就在于这部戏表现了现实生活复杂曲折的面貌，以及在生活中作为主流的那种力量。
    说这部戏生活气息浓郁，并不是说作者在这部戏中描写了一些习见的人物，乃至于罗列了一些末节的生活琐事，而是在于他通过舞台动作，舞台形象，很鲜明地显示了人——这是一个多么值得骄傲、值得珍重的称号；以及人在改变自然和其他的客观环境中会发挥出多么巨大的、无坚不摧的力量。因而，整部戏中都贯串了我们生活中一个最重要的课题：尊重人，爱护人，为改变人的命运，使其变得更为美好而斗争！
    因之，它突破了它所描绘的题材的局限，获得更广泛的范围中的共鸣！这是和一般所谓“工业戏”迥乎不同的地方。
    最后，谈一点技巧方面的问题。我不知道作者是否有意识地这样做：我总感觉这部戏部分地体现着我国古代戏曲中某些喜剧处理的传统手法，诸如在通过多次的动作重复突现一个喜剧人物（王守义）上；特别是在最后一场对于人物上下场的极其紧凑的安排上，都使人宛如重逢旧友，很新鲜，但又有规模可寻，不是那种徒以突兀取胜的“悬置”所可以比拟的。我想，这是值得加以肯定的。也是一个值得好好研究的题目。
    最近，北京话剧舞台上，外国戏和古典戏的分量比较重一些，在反映现实生活的剧目比较缺少的情况下说来，“双婚记”的演出和它所达到的成就，应当被视为是可喜的。
