    Run Higher Education Libraries Well

    The recently convened Higher Education Library Work Conference stipulated the guiding principles and tasks of library work in higher education, pointing out that higher education libraries should play an important role in improving teaching quality, carrying out academic research, and realizing the plan to advance towards science.

    In recent years, library work in China's institutions of higher education has made great progress and changes. Before liberation, libraries in institutions of higher education had a total of more than 6 million books and periodicals. By the summer of this year, according to incomplete statistics, the collections of 212 higher education libraries have increased to more than 37 million volumes. Higher education libraries have done a great deal of work and achieved great results in coordinating teaching work, academic thought criticism, and carrying out scientific research work. Especially after the call to advance towards science was issued, library work in higher education institutions across the country has undergone many new improvements, revised reading regulations, relaxed restrictions on the number of books borrowed, and simplified borrowing procedures, further providing convenient conditions for readers.

    In the past, due to the lack of attention to library work by the Ministry of Higher Education and various higher education institutions, the guiding principles and tasks of library work were not clearly defined. Therefore, in the past few years, many higher education institutions only one-sidedly emphasized serving students, neglecting the needs of teachers to carry out scientific research work. Since the call to advance towards science was issued, there has been a phenomenon of one-sidedly emphasizing serving scientific research and neglecting teaching. At the same time, because some necessary working systems have not been well established, many higher education libraries have only become book depositories, with a large number of books and periodicals shelved and the book circulation rate is very low, failing to play their due role. Many books and periodicals have not been sorted out to this day, and the phenomenon of accumulation and confusion is still very serious, or there are books without catalogs, or there are catalogs without books, so that many useful books cannot be circulated and used. Some have been sorted out, but have not been fully utilized. Some school libraries have not conducted careful research and review of book purchase plans, or even have no plans at all, but instead purchase books in large quantities blindly, resulting in many unnecessary wastes. Some institutions of higher education have long lacked full-time leading cadres for libraries, and some staff members in the library are not experts in library work, and some are neither familiar with the business nor have a low level of education. This also has a great impact on the development of school library services. The conditions for library work are also not good enough, the stacks and reading rooms are generally very crowded, and the construction of libraries is not keeping up with the needs of the work. All these have created some difficulties for library work.

    Based on the situation and experience of library work in higher education institutions in recent years, it is very important to clearly define the tasks of higher education libraries in order to do a good job in library work in higher education institutions. The task of higher education institutions in our country today is to train socialist senior construction talents who master modern science and technology for the country. And the library of higher education is an important part of higher education, and it is an academic institution that assists teaching and scientific research work. The task of the school library should be subordinate to the task of the school. Therefore, the tasks of higher education libraries should be: to serve teaching and scientific research; the service objects are mainly teachers and students.

    In order to enable the library to better serve teaching and scientific research, higher education libraries must strive to cooperate with teaching work on the one hand, providing teachers with the necessary reference books and periodicals in teaching work, so that they can absorb the latest achievements of world science into textbooks at any time and impart them to students; at the same time, they must also provide students with the reference books needed for learning, so that they can read more books in their spare time and cultivate their ability to learn and think independently. On the other hand, the library must also purchase and collect various reference books and periodicals and supplement specialized books and documents according to the school's scientific research work plan, in order to meet the needs of teachers and students engaged in scientific research work, and further achieve the requirements of improving teaching quality. It is wrong to emphasize serving teaching one-sidedly, or to emphasize serving scientific research one-sidedly. In addition, library staff must also carry out scientific research work, constantly strengthen theoretical and business research, so that the level of library science, bibliography and library technology can be gradually improved. According to the needs of the development of higher education, higher education libraries should further develop in a professional direction.

    The quality of library services for teaching and scientific research in higher education institutions largely depends on the supplement and supply of books. In order to do this well, school libraries should make reasonable arrangements step by step and in a planned way, according to the actual needs of the school's teaching and scientific research work, as well as the basis and characteristics of the library's collection, and supplement and supply teaching books, scientific research books, political studies, and other books for extracurricular reading, with different priorities and urgency. School libraries should correctly implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in supplementing and supplying books and periodicals, and all kinds of works with academic value can be opened and supplied to teachers and students for research and reference.

    For existing books and periodicals, school libraries should regularly clean them up and do a good job in the allocation of books and periodicals to overcome the phenomenon of blind purchase of books. We should further expand the scope of book circulation, advocate inter-library lending and cooperation to improve the utilization rate of books; we should strive to use scientific methods to classify, catalog and manage books and periodicals to facilitate readers' borrowing and use. When supplementing books, all schools should conscientiously implement the principle of thrift.

    The Ministry of Higher Education and institutions of higher education must fully attach importance to school library work, appoint special personnel to be responsible for and lead this work. At the same time, they should care about the allocation, training and improvement of library cadres, and give full play to the role of library experts. We should adopt the method of experts leading apprentices and running small short-term training courses to train library talents. All institutions of higher education should think of more ways, tap more potential, carry forward the spirit of hard work and thrift, overcome difficulties, and run libraries diligently and thriftily.

### 办好高等学校图书馆

    办好高等学校图书馆
    最近召开的高等学校图书馆工作会议，规定了高等学校图书馆工作的方针和任务，指出高等学校图书馆应该在提高教学质量，开展学术研究工作，实现向科学进军的计划中，起重要的作用。
    我国高等学校的图书馆工作几年来有了很大的进展和变化。解放前高等学校图书馆共有书刊六百多万册，到今年暑期，据不完全的统计，有二百一十二个高等学校的图书馆的藏书，已经增加到三千七百多万册。高等学校图书馆在配合教学工作、学术思想批判以及开展科学研究工作方面，都做了不少工作，有很大的成绩。特别是在向科学进军的号召发出以后，全国各高等学校图书馆工作都有了不少新的改进，修改了阅览的规章，放宽了借书册数的限制，简化了借书的手续，进一步为读者提供了便利的条件。
    过去由于高等教育部和各高等学校对图书馆工作的领导不够重视，没有明确规定图书馆工作的方针任务。因此，前几年，许多高等学校只片面地强调了为学生服务，忽视了教师们进行科学研究工作的需要。自从向科学进军的号召发出以后，又出现了片面强调为科学研究服务，而忽视教学的现象。同时，因为有些必要的工作制度没有很好地建立起来，许多高等学校图书馆都只变成了藏书楼，大批书刊束之高阁，图书流通率很低，不能发挥应有的作用。很多书刊至今未加整理，积压混乱的现象还很严重，或者有书无目录，或者有目录无书，以致许多有用的图书不能流通利用。有的整理了，也没有做到充分利用。有些学校图书馆对于采购图书的计划，没有经过认真的研究审查，甚至根本没有计划，只是大量地盲目地抢购图书，造成了许多不应有的浪费。有些高等学校长期缺乏图书馆的专职领导干部，馆内工作人员有的对图书馆工作是外行，有的既不熟悉业务，文化程度又低。这样对开展学校图书馆的业务也有很大的影响。图书馆工作的条件也还不够好，书库和阅览室一般都很拥挤，图书馆的建设还赶不上工作的需要。这些都给图书馆工作造成了一些困难。
    根据几年来高等学校图书馆工作的情况和经验来看，要把高等学校图书馆工作做好，明确规定高等学校图书馆的任务是很重要的。今天我国高等学校的任务，是为国家培养掌握现代化科学技术的社会主义高级建设人才。而高等学校的图书馆是高等学校的一个重要组成部分，是辅助教学和科学研究工作的学术性机构。学校图书馆的任务，应该服从学校工作的任务。因此，高等学校图书馆的任务应该是：为教学和科学研究服务；服务对象主要是教师和学生。
      为了使图书馆能更好地为教学和科学研究服务，高等学校图书馆一方面必须为配合教学工作而努力，供给教师们在教学工作中必需的参考书刊，使他们能够把世界科学的最新成就随时吸收到教材中去传授给学生；同时也必须供给学生学习上所需要的参考书籍，使他们能在课外时间多读些书，培养他们独立学习和思考的能力。另一方面，图书馆还必需根据学校的科学研究工作计划，采购和搜集各种参考书刊和资料，补充专门性的图书文献，以适应从事科学研究工作的教师和学生的需要，进一步达到提高教学质量的要求。片面地强调了为教学服务，或是片面地强调了为科学研究服务都是不对的。此外，图书馆的工作人员也必须进行科学研究工作，不断地加强理论和业务研究，使图书馆学、目录学和图书馆技术的水平都能逐步提高。根据高等教育发展上的需要，高等学校图书馆还应该进一步向专业方向发展。
    高等学校图书馆为教学和科学研究服务的工作质量，在很大程度上还决定于图书的补充和供应。为了做好这一工作，学校图书馆应该根据学校教学工作和科学研究工作的实际需要，以及图书馆藏书的基础和特点，有步骤地有计划地进行合理的安排，分别轻重缓急，补充和供应教学用书、科学研究用书、政治学习以及课外阅读的其他书籍。学校图书馆在补充和供应书刊中应该正确地执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策，对有学术价值的各种著作，都可以开放，供应教师和学生的研究和参考。
    对于现存书刊，学校图书馆应该定期清理，并且做好书刊调拨工作，克服盲目采购图书的现象。要进一步扩大图书流通范围，提倡馆际之间的互借合作，以提高图书的利用率；要努力做到用科学的方法，进行书刊的分类、编目和保管工作，以便利读者的借阅和使用。各校在补充图书的时候，还应该认真贯彻节约的原则。
    高等教育部和高等学校都必须充分地重视学校图书馆工作，指定专人负责，领导这项工作。同时要关心图书馆干部的配备、培养和提高，充分发挥图书馆专家的作用。要采用专家带徒弟和开办小型短期训练班的办法，培养图书馆人才。各个高等学校都应该多想办法，多发掘潜力，发扬艰苦朴素的作风，克服困难，勤俭办好图书馆。
