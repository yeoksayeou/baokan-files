Hump Marshalling Yard

　　Hump marshalling yards are currently the most advanced marshalling equipment. A hump marshalling yard is one where, when each car or group of cars is uncoupled for reassembly, a shunting locomotive pushes these vehicles up a small hill about three to five meters above the ground. Then, the couplings are detached, allowing the uncoupled vehicles or groups of vehicles (several vehicles coupled together) to automatically roll down from the summit into the designated lines of the classification yard, using the downhill terrain. Because the shape of this small hill resembles the hump on a camel's back, it is called a hump. Marshalling yards that use this method for sorting and assembling trains are called hump marshalling yards.

　　The main characteristics of hump marshalling yards are their large sorting capacity, high efficiency, and operational safety. Generally, it takes an average of 30 to 45 minutes to dismantle a train using a lead track in a flat marshalling station, while it takes an average of only 15 to 20 minutes to dismantle a train in a hump marshalling yard. The signals and switches within a hump marshalling yard are controlled entirely from a central signal tower. During operation, a single operator only needs to press the levers or buttons on the control panel, thus saving a lot of manpower and making it safer, more reliable, and more efficient than manual switching.

　　There are many types of hump marshalling yards, classified by operating capacity as small-capacity humps and large-capacity humps; by layout as transverse humps, semi-longitudinal humps, and longitudinal humps; by direction as single-direction humps and double-direction humps; and by technical equipment as non-mechanized (manual) humps, mechanized humps, and automated humps.

　　The Fengtai and Sujiatun hump marshalling yards, built during China's First Five-Year Plan period, are large-capacity, longitudinal, single-direction, mechanized humps. Generally, the operating capacity of a large-capacity single hump (referring to the ability to dismantle vehicles from the summit to the classification yard below) reaches about 5,000 to 6,000 vehicles per day and night. The operating capacities of the Fengtai and Sujiatun hump marshalling yards are both above 6,000 vehicles. With the needs of the rapid development of the national economy, China will build more hump marshalling yards in the future. (Ren Qinghai)

　　驼峰调车场
    驼峰调车场是目前最先进的编组设备。所谓驼峰调车场，就是在把每一辆车或每一组车解开重新编组时，利用调车的火车头，将这些车辆推上一个比地面高约三公尺到五公尺左右的小丘，然后把车钩摘开，使被解开车钩的车辆或者车组（几个车辆挂在一起）借着下坡的地形条件自动从峰顶上顺势溜入编组场指定的线路。因为这个小丘的形状像骆驼背上的凸包，所以称它为驼峰。用这种形式调车编组的车场，叫做驼峰调车场。
    驼峰调车场的特点主要是编解能力大、效率高、作业安全。一般在平面编组站上利用牵出线解体一个车列，平均需要三十到四十五分钟，而驼峰调车场解体一个车列，平均只要十五到二十分钟。在驼峰调车场内的信号和道岔的操纵，完全集中在一个信号楼里，作业时只要一个值班员按动操纵盘上的手柄或电钮就可以了，因此能节省很多人力，比人工扳道安全可靠，效率高。
    驼峰调车场种类很多，按作业能力分，有小能力驼峰、大能力驼峰；按布置形式分，有横列式驼峰、半纵列式驼峰、纵列式驼峰；按方向分，可分为单方向驼峰和双方向驼峰；按技术装备的不同又分为非机械化（人工）驼峰、机械化驼峰和自动化驼峰。
    我国第一个五年计划期间建设的丰台和苏家屯驼峰调车场，都是大能力的、纵列式的、单方向的、机械化驼峰。一般大能力单驼峰的作业能力（指由峰顶向峰下车场解体车辆的能力），每昼夜达五千到六千辆左右，丰台和苏家屯驼峰调车场的作业能力都在六千辆以上。随着国民经济迅速发展的需要，我国今后将要修建更多的驼峰调车场。　（任庆海）
