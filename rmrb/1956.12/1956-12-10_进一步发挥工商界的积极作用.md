    Further Unleash the Positive Role of Industry and Commerce
    The Second Members' Representative Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is scheduled to open today. This congress will discuss how to further unleash the positive role of industry and commerce and determine the future direction of industry and commerce. There is no doubt that this congress is of great significance.
      One year ago, in November 1955, the Second Meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, held in Beijing, focused on the further development of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Over the past year, under the influence of the nationwide upsurge of the socialist revolution, capitalist industry and commerce in our country have rapidly and comprehensively achieved overall public-private joint ownership. Small merchants and peddlers and handicraftsmen have partly joined public-private joint ownership, and most have embarked on the road of cooperativization. Private industry and commerce, which accounted for a considerable proportion of our national economy, have been transformed into socialist public-private joint enterprises. They can now directly carry out production and operation according to the needs of the state and the people. This is a great victory of historical significance in the socialist transformation of our country, which has had a huge impact on the world.
    Private industrialists and businessmen's embarking on the road of overall public-private joint ownership is the result of the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, and also the result of the increasing political awareness of the industrialists and businessmen. Since liberation, private industrialists and businessmen have witnessed the rapid development of the motherland's construction and have been profoundly educated in successive social movements, gradually realizing the consistency of loving the country and loving socialism, and recognizing that accepting socialist transformation and taking the socialist road is the general trend and the will of the people, which is beneficial to the country and to themselves. Therefore, when the upsurge of socialist transformation arrived, they joyfully embarked on the road of overall public-private joint ownership. After the overall public-private joint ownership, the majority of capitalists and capitalist agents have worked hard, studied diligently, and more than 300,000 private personnel have actively participated in the socialist emulation campaign, and a number of advanced producers and advanced workers have emerged.
    At present, the basic trend in industry and commerce is positive and forward-looking. However, this does not mean that there are no negative factors and negative effects in industry and commerce. The negative factors and negative effects of industry and commerce change with the changes in historical conditions. At present, some people in industry and commerce have not fully overcome the old ideas and old styles in production and operation. They are not active enough, not proactive enough in their work, dare not boldly take responsibility, or are content with the status quo. They lack a correct understanding of the leadership of the working class, and some even have some resistance.
    Some people believe that after the overall public-private joint ownership and fixed interest of private industry and commerce, the bourgeoisie no longer has any negative effects; even if there are some negative effects, they are negligible. This statement is not in line with the facts and is detrimental to the cause of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. This statement may cause industrialists and businessmen to lose their direction of effort and relax their efforts to train themselves and strive for progress. This is only harmful and not beneficial to themselves and the public-private joint enterprises where they are located.
    Industrialists and businessmen have politically accepted the overall public-private joint ownership and have become staff members of public-private joint enterprises in terms of organization. This does not mean that they have completely abandoned bourgeois ideas, viewpoints, and capitalist management styles. At present, the contradiction and difference between them and the working class, in addition to maintaining a certain degree of exploitation, the most important thing lies in this aspect. Before the overall public-private joint ownership, the Party and the working class required industrialists and businessmen to love the country, abide by the law, and accept transformation; most industrialists and businessmen also encouraged themselves with this. Now, because the vast majority of industrialists and businessmen have become staff members of public-private joint enterprises, they themselves are no longer satisfied with this lower requirement. In the future, they should play a greater role, be dutiful, get close to the workers and staff, change their old business ideas and business styles, and consciously serve the socialist construction cause. Only by closely combining their own interests with the interests of the country, taking the initiative to get close to the working class, continuing to improve their relationship with the workers, consciously changing their old ideas and old styles, and actively serving the country and the people, can industrialists and businessmen further improve the relationship between public and private cooperation and further unleash the positive role of industry and commerce.
    In the process of transforming ideology and style, we must first rely on our own efforts, and then on the help of others. The working class in our country has always been unsparing in helping people; many insightful industrialists and businessmen have long had this understanding and feeling in successive social movements and daily relations since liberation. In the future, when getting along with public representatives and the masses of workers in daily life, and at various meetings, industrialists and businessmen should express their doubts and opinions, difficulties and requirements, so that they can further understand, sympathize with, and help each other.
    Our Party and government believe that our national bourgeoisie is patriotic. In the past few years, our national bourgeoisie has also proved its patriotism with facts. Now, private personnel in public-private joint enterprises are working hard to learn new management methods and new science and technology. The more skills they learn, the more contributions they will make to the country's construction cause. The more they work hard in public-private joint enterprises, the greater the role they can play.
    Now, the government's handling of various issues for industrialists and businessmen is certainly not perfect. However, no matter what the situation is in the continued implementation of the fixed interest method, no matter what problems need to be solved in terms of personnel arrangements and living care, our Party and government will always earnestly discuss with industry and commerce, follow the mass line, and seek a solution that is satisfactory to all parties. At this Congress of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, any opinions on all aspects of work can be put forward. If the suggestions are correct, the relevant government departments will definitely accept them; if the suggestions are incorrect, the relevant government departments will also be able to give explanations and explanations to reassure everyone. Everyone remembers that before the overall public-private joint ownership, many major things were handled properly by relying on consultation methods. What problems can't be solved now that everyone has raised some questions? Representatives of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, we warmly congratulate you on the success of this conference, and hope that you will more effectively unleash the positive role of industry and commerce and mobilize all industrialists and businessmen to serve the country's socialist cause.

### 进一步发挥工商界的积极作用

    进一步发挥工商界的积极作用
    中华全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会，定在今天开幕。这次大会将要讨论如何进一步发挥工商界的积极作用，决定工商界今后努力的方向。毫无疑问，这次大会是有重大意义的。
      一年以前，1955年11月，在北京召开的中华全国工商业联合会执行委员会第二次会议，着重地讨论了进一步开展资本主义工商业社会主义改造的问题。一年以来，在全国社会主义革命高潮影响下，我国资本主义工商业迅速地、全面地实现了全行业的公私合营。小商小贩和手工业者，一部分参加了公私合营，大部分走上了合作化的道路。在我国国民经济中占相当比重的私营工商业，已经转变为社会主义性质的公私合营企业。它们可以直接根据国家和人民的需要进行生产和经营了。这是我国的社会主义改造事业中的一个具有历史意义的伟大胜利，它在全世界发生了巨大的影响。
    私营工商业者走上全行业公私合营的道路，是中国共产党和人民政府正确领导的结果，也是工商业者的政治觉悟日益提高的结果。解放以来，私营工商业者亲眼看到祖国建设事业飞跃发展，又在历次社会运动中受到深刻的教育，逐渐认识到爱国家和爱社会主义的一致性，认识到接受社会主义改造、走社会主义道路，是大势所趋，人心所向，对国家、对自己都有好处。所以，在社会主义改造高潮到来的时候，他们就欢欣鼓舞地走上全行业公私合营的道路。全行业公私合营以后，大多数资本家和资本家代理人都努力工作，用心学习，并且有三十多万私方人员，积极地参加了社会主义竞赛运动，涌现出一批先进生产者和先进工作者。
    目前工商界的基本趋势是积极的、前进的。但是，这并不是说，工商界已经完全没有了消极因素和消极作用。工商界的消极因素和消极作用，是随着历史条件的变化而变化的。现在工商界中有一部分人在生产经营方面的旧思想和旧作风还没有充分克服。他们对工作还不够积极，不够主动，不敢大胆负责，或者安于现状。他们对于工人阶级的领导还缺乏正确的认识，有的甚至还有某些抵触情绪。
    有人认为私营工商业全行业公私合营和定息以后，资产阶级已经没有什么消极作用；就是有些消极作用，也是微不足道的了。这种说法是不符合事实的，对资本主义工商业社会主义改造事业是不利的。这种说法可能使工商业者迷失努力的方向，放松锻炼自己、争取进步的努力。这对于他们自己，对于他们所在的公私合营企业，都只有坏处而没有好处。
    工商业者在政治上接受了全行业公私合营，在组织上成为公私合营企业的工作人员，这并不等于已经完全抛弃了资产阶级思想、观点和资本主义的经营作风。目前他们同工人阶级的矛盾和区别，除了还保持一定程度的剥削以外，最重要的就在这个方面。在全行业公私合营以前，党和工人阶级对工商业者的要求，是爱国守法，接受改造；多数工商业者也曾以此自勉。现在由于绝大多数工商业者已经成为公私合营企业的工作人员，他们自己也不满足于这种较低的要求了。他们今后应该发挥更大的积极性，守职尽责，靠拢职工，改变旧的经营思想和经营作风，自觉地为社会主义建设事业服务。工商业者只有把自己的利益同国家的利益密切地结合起来，主动地靠拢工人阶级，继续改善自己同工人的关系，自觉地改变旧思想旧作风，积极地为国家和人民办事，才能进一步改善公私共事的关系，进一步发挥工商界的积极作用。
    在改造思想作风的过程中，首先要依靠自己的努力，然后才是别人的帮助。我国工人阶级从来是毫不吝惜帮助人的；许多有识见的工商业者，在解放以来历次社会运动和日常的关系中，早已有了这种认识和感觉。今后在同公方代表和工人群众日常相处的时候，在各种各样的会议上，工商业者们更应该把自己的疑虑和意见、困难和要求都说出来，彼此开诚布公，就能够进一步互相了解、同情和帮助了。
    我们的党和政府认为我国民族资产阶级是爱国的。这几年来我国民族资产阶级也已经用事实证明了自己是爱国的。现在公私合营企业中的私方人员正在努力学习新的经营管理方法和新的科学技术。他们学会更多的本领，对于国家的建设事业将有更多的贡献。他们在公私合营企业中越努力锻炼，他们可能发挥的作用也越大。
    现在，政府处理工商业者的各种问题，当然并不是已经尽善尽美了的。但是，无论在定息办法的继续实行中有什么情况，无论对于人事的安排和生活的照顾等方面还有什么问题需要解决，我们的党和政府总是会同工商界切实商量，走群众路线，求得各方面比较满意地解决问题。这一次工商联代表大会对于各方面工作有什么意见都可以提出来。提得对的，政府有关部门一定会接受；提得不对的，政府有关部门也能给以说明和解释，使大家安下心来。大家记得，在全行业公私合营以前，有许多重大事情，依靠协商的方法，办的都妥妥当当，大家现在提出的一些问题，还有什么不能解决的？工商联的代表们，我们热烈地祝贺你们这次大会的成功，希望你们更有效地发挥工商界的积极作用，动员一切工商业者为国家的社会主义事业而服务。
