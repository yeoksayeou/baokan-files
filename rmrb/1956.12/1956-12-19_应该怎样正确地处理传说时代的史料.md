The history of almost all ancient peoples (in the broad sense) begins with legends. Some peoples did not have writing when they began to preserve historical legends, so they could only pass them down orally; other peoples, although they already had writing at that time, had not yet developed to the point where they could clearly record events and words, so they still had to pass down history orally. Because social development was still in its primitive stage at that time, religious sentiment was unusually strong, to the point where "gods and humans were indistinguishable," so the historical legends left behind at that time were inevitably mixed with many myths. As human knowledge increased, history and mythology became increasingly separated. Only with the flourishing of science could mythology completely withdraw from the historical stage. In studying ancient history, it is very inappropriate to either naively believe myths as history or completely reject historical legends mixed with myths.

For more than two thousand years, our country's judgment of the truth or falsehood of ancient historical facts has been entirely "compromised by Confucius," and it is believed that the "Six Classics" are the works of Confucius. Therefore, Sima Qian, in writing the "Records of the Grand Historian," always "examined the credibility of the Six Classics" when it came to ancient history. Since then, whatever conformed to the classics was considered true, and whatever did not conform to the classics was considered false. The Confucian school inherited Confucius' tradition of disliking talk of gods and the strange, so they deleted many mythological legends from the historical legends they preserved. The historical materials preserved in the classics are quite humanized, and are suited to the level of human knowledge at that time. Most Confucians after the Qin and Han dynasties no longer knew the true meaning of the pre-Qin philosophers' regret for ancient beginnings, but inherited the tradition of valuing the ancient and belittling the present. Thus, ancient figures became more and more idealized, making ancient times an unattainable golden age. It was not until the seventeenth century that Wang Chuanshan clearly recognized that such idealization did not conform to historical facts. He pointed out that the various states in the eras of Yao, Shun, and Yu were no different from the native chieftains of the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou at the end of the Ming dynasty. Society before Tang and Yu was not as good as after Tang and Yu, and the "prosperous era of the Three Dynasties" was not as good as after the Three Dynasties. Human beings not only made progress in knowledge, but also gradually progressed in terms of morality due to the efforts of sages and virtuous men throughout the ages. This was a very insightful idea.

At the beginning of this century, influenced by Western academics, we became even more aware that such an idealized antiquity did not conform to the stages of historical development. At that time, the old feudal forces had not yet been greatly shaken, and the power of the old idols was still quite strong, and the biggest idols were Yao, Shun, Yu, Confucius and others. Therefore, in the early 1920s, the cry to overthrow idols rose to the clouds. Confucius lived relatively recently, and his deeds were clearer, so it was only possible to deny his theories, not his personality. The first three people lived in more distant times, and the legends about them were full of contradictions and mythology, so the existence of their personalities also became a big problem. If the relatively less vague legends about Yao, Shun, and Yu were already like this, then the even more vague legends before them should be completely erased, so that they would no longer be mixed into the realm of history. This was the view of the extreme Doubting Antiquity school. Around 1930, genuine historical workers hardly dared to speak about the history before Yin Ruins, except for the work of identifying forgeries. Although a few people still did some work, there were almost no opinions that could be accepted by most of the historical community. Although a small number of materialist historians also disagreed with this practice of castrating history, they did not yet have the time to make correct research and conclusions on the issue of handling our country's legendary historical materials. The period from the 1920s to the early 1940s can be said to be the heyday of the Doubting Antiquity school.

After the national liberation, the historical community launched a fervent study of historical materialism, and gradually realized that although the Doubting Antiquity school had worked extremely hard on the study of ancient history and had achieved considerable results, their views were still too simplistic and too one-sided. They understood that all the legends that have been passed down from ancient times, although they have lost much of their truth due to being passed down orally for too long, still retain a historical core and should not be ignored. At present, the historical community's attitude towards the historical materials of the legendary era can be roughly divided into two categories: one is to start quoting legendary historical materials or to try to explain ancient legends or myths from the perspective of social development history. The methods they use still have room for discussion; the other is that although they admit that the Doubting Antiquity school made many mistakes and are unwilling to follow them again, they are still deeply influenced by them and cannot eliminate it in a short time. They feel that although there may be a historical core in the legends, the materials are too few and the truth and falsehood are unclear, so they will not talk about it for the time being, waiting for underground materials to confirm or deny it in the future before talking about it, so that they can make fewer mistakes. To those who hold the latter attitude, I will now only say a few words, that is, ancient legends all have origins. For example, the name of Xiaotun Yin Ruins is actually based on the text in the Records of the Grand Historian, Biography of Xiang Yu: "Then he agreed with him on the Yin Ruins south of the Huan River," and the Yin Ruins, before Sima Qian's record, was nothing more than a folk legend. Ancient legends certainly need the proof or denial of archaeological work, and archaeological work also needs the guidance of ancient legends. The idea of waiting for archaeological work to be done before talking about ancient legends is wrong.

Regarding the methods used by those who have begun to quote legendary historical materials, I believe there are several points that can be discussed:

First, before quoting historical materials recorded in "canonical books" or "official histories," they have not undergone a careful critique, or their critique is limited to the superficially unreasonable places, such as saying "riding a dragon to reach the four seas," or that during the Xia Dynasty, "the tribute was beautiful jade and iron," etc. As for the basic nature of these "canonical books" and "official histories," they do not doubt it. We believe that this attitude is incorrect. Now no one denies that before the formation of the Han nationality in ancient China, there were several clan groups, but the distinctions between these primitive races cannot be seen at all in the historical materials of the canonical books and official histories. According to the "canonical books" and "official histories," these clan groups are very systematic, and the ancient sage emperors and enlightened kings are descended from a single line (in terms of the political system, not bloodline). It can almost be said that it was a unified world at that time, which is certainly not correct. The "canonical books" and "official histories" have all been systematized by later Confucians. For example, the three chapters of Yao Dian, Gao Yao Mo, and Yu Gong in the Book of Documents were not written in the Xia, Shang, or Western Zhou dynasties, but were gathered by people in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods and gradually revised before they became what they are now. This kind of systematized material has been comprehensively deleted and revised, and has gradually become distorted. Its degree of reliability is much worse than the fragmented, unsystematic materials preserved in "Zuo Zhuan," "Guo Yu," pre-Qin philosophers, and other pre-Qin ancient books. Therefore, simply citing the statements of canonical books or official histories is inappropriate.

Second, seeing that archaeological materials or ethnological materials are consistent with ancient legends, they do not carefully consider their temporal relationship and compare and attach them to each other. For example, seeing traces of fire in the pit of the Peking Man, they compare it to the legend of Suirenshi. In fact, the ancient legends that we have preserved today are roughly within the last few thousand years. The most deeply impressed and longest-lasting legends may be preserved for tens of thousands of years. As for preserving them for a long period of five or six hundred thousand years, that is almost impossible. Suirenshi either refers to a clan or to an era. It does not seem to be based on the conjecture of thinkers, but on a genuine legend from ancient times. What it refers to is not the beginning of human use of natural fire, but the beginning of using the method of drilling wood to make fire by friction. There must have been a long period from using natural fire to making fire by human power. We speculate that this progress must have occurred after the appearance of humans (nearly hundreds of thousands of years ago). Therefore, the traces of fire in the lower cave of Zhoukoudian have no connection with the legend of Suirenshi.

Another example is seeing the uncertainty of the title of father in oracle bone inscriptions and inferring the "punalua" family. In fact, the form of group marriage in the "punalua" style was far in the era of savagery. As for the end of the Yin dynasty, if we use Engels' method of periodization, it should be in the middle stage of the barbarian era, with a very long distance in between. Looking at the legends of China for a considerable period before the Yin Ruins, it seems that the dual family stage had already entered in the era of Yao, Shun, and Yu. It may be possible to say that the uncertainty of the title of father at the end of the Yin dynasty was a legacy of the customs of the "punalua" family era, but it is absolutely impossible to prove that it was still in the "punalua" family stage at that time. Even now, in our hometown of Nanyang, there is still a custom of calling one's own father uncle. When a stranger comes to a person's home, it is impossible to judge who is whose son simply by listening to the children's names. If we judge from this phenomenon that our hometown is still in the "punalua" family stage, wouldn't that be a big joke?

The strangest thing is trying to explain the myth in Huainanzi that "the pillar of heaven is broken, the rope of earth is broken," "the sky does not fully cover, the earth does not fully carry, the fire burns and does not extinguish, and the water is vast and does not stop," but citing the great changes in the terrain talked about in geology. These great changes are not from the Quaternary period of the Cenozoic era, but from the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras or the early Cenozoic era. What is the use of citing these? The earliest humans occurred in the early Quaternary period of the Cenozoic era, no more than one million years ago. As for the Paleozoic era, it began 200 million years ago and ended hundreds of millions of years ago. The Mesozoic era also ended tens of millions of years ago. At this time, there were only mammals, and primates had not yet appeared, let alone humans! There have not been great geological changes in the last million years. After the era of the Peking Man, there was no major mountain-building movement, nor would it have caused the myth of "the fire burns and does not extinguish, and the water is vast and does not stop." Citing the geological changes in the terrain is of no use in explaining the above myth. Therefore, without a clear understanding of the length of time, they take similar statements and compare them to each other, which is not a truly scientific attitude.

Trying to use the methods and materials of social development history to explain ancient legends or myths is a correct direction, but simply saying the method of social development history is too general and not specific enough, and the methods used also have room for discussion. The main thing is that they often do not separate pure myths from historical legends mixed with myths. This kind of confusion is inherited from the Doubting Antiquity school. Because the Doubting Antiquity school was not clear about this point, they came to the result of completely erasing everything. It is certainly too naive to mistake historical legends mixed with myths for history, but it is also a way to throw out the baby with the bathwater to abandon historical factors surrounded by myths because of distrust of myths. The facts described in Homer's epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, are full of mythological flavors, but now there is archaeological evidence, and historians completely believe in the actual existence of this long-term war, and also want to find the structure and customs of the society at that time from its description.

Our country does not have many pure myths, only words such as "the sky is one zhang higher every day, the earth is one zhang thicker every day, and Pangu grows one zhang every day." As for the legends of Yan Emperor, Huang Emperor, Chi You, Taihao, and other ancient emperors, its magical meaning is far less than that of the heroes in the Iliad. How can they be regarded as pure myths! These two types must be clearly distinguished before their true meaning can be gradually found.

Secondly, they do not pay enough attention to the changes in the myths and historical legends mixed with myths themselves, and often equate the earliest simple myths or legends with the later myths or legends that have become more and more changed. In fact, the more ancient legends are closer to the ancient times, and the distortion is relatively small, so it is easier to infer the original quality before the distortion. As for the legends about ancient times that came out later, although they also have ancient legends as blueprints, they have been changed, revised, and revised again. The original reliable quality is almost completely gone, and it is impossible to find the real historical factors from it. Even if a little is found, it is unreliable. For example, some people take Luo Mi's statement in "Lu Shi" of the Song Dynasty as an ancient legend, but everyone knows that Luo had several fixed prejudices when writing. First, he believed that ancient China was unified, so the ancient emperors were continuous and uninterrupted. Second, he did not recognize that myths came from multiple sources, some reliable and some unreliable. As long as he saw a legend, he regarded it as a treasure. Third, the names of people, clans, and places in ancient China were often indistinguishable, but Luo did not pay attention to this point. When he encountered something that he could not explain, he arbitrarily changed ancient books. Luo Mi's "Lu Shi" is very interesting and should be studied, not because it is reliable, but because it can be said to be the last time a comprehensive work was done. He also roughly told us the source of the material in the notes. If we look carefully at his notes, we can infer how his work was done and how it was deleted, revised, added, and subtracted. From this book, we can infer how the older comprehensive materials were successful and what their value was. People who study legendary historical materials indiscriminately mix the late materials in books like "Lu Shi" with ancient legends and equate them, but want to guess the truth of history from this. We think this is impossible.

In short, if we now want to study the historical materials of legends, the first thing is to clearly distinguish between the materials of the pre-Qin period and the materials of the post-Qin and Han periods. The former is the main one and can be used as a marker, while the latter can only be used as an auxiliary. Second, in the pre-Qin materials, we must distinguish between comprehensive materials and unsystematized materials. Systematize and organize the latter type of materials, and use it as a standard to examine which parts of the former type of materials are reliable and which parts are unreliable. Third, the materials of the post-Qin and Han periods are not far from the ancient times, or there may be materials that were not passed down to the present but could still be seen at that time. As long as they have not been affected by the erroneous parts of the previous comprehensive materials, they can also be adopted. Finally, although Qiao Zhou, Huangfu Mi, and Li Daoyuan were not highly knowledgeable about history, they were very diligent in collecting ancient legends. The anecdotes they recorded can also be taken for reference as long as they do not conflict with the unsystematized materials of the pre-Qin period. As for the ancient historical materials recorded in books after this, they should be completely erased to avoid confusing the audience. These rules are certainly too simple to be able to bear the heavy responsibility of handling legendary historical materials, but they are all basic rules that should be paid special attention to. Now I specially put them forward, hoping that everyone will consider, discuss, and correct them. It would be a great fortune if a complete set of methods for handling legendary historical materials can be obtained.

There are now several books translated into Chinese from the works of scholars in capitalist countries as reference materials for handling legendary historical materials, but I have not yet seen any translated from the Soviet Union or other socialist countries. Most of the books cited by those who are doing this kind of research in China now are the former type. Generally speaking, the materials in this part of the works are still mostly reliable and have reference value. However, the theories in them are mostly imbued with idealistic colors, which means that their evidence is not sufficient, and many conclusions are drawn from speculation, without true and reliable scientific value. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries do not focus on research in this area, and there may not be many works, but there should be some. Guided by the spirit of Marxism-Leninism and seeking truth from facts, the conclusions reached must be more reliable. I hope that several of them will be translated as soon as possible to guide the research on the historical materials of the legendary era in our country with correct Marxist-Leninist works, so that it can progress more rapidly, which would be even better.

    应该怎样正确地处理传说时代的史料
    中国科学院考古研究所研究员　徐旭生
    一切古民族（用广义的含义）的历史开头差不多全是由传说组成。有些民族，当它们开始保存有关历史传说的时候，还没有文字，只好口耳相传；另外一些民族，当日虽说已经有了文字，可是还没有发达到可以明确的记事和记言的程度，所以对历史只好仍是口耳相传。由于当日社会发展仍在原始阶段，宗教情绪异常浓厚，以至“神人不分”，所以当日所遗留的历史传说没有不混杂很多的神话的。人知愈开，历史与神话才愈来愈分离。必须科学昌明，神话才完全退出历史舞台。治远古的历史，轻信神话为历史和完全排斥混杂神话的历史传说这两种极端的偏向，全是很不适宜的。
    我国两千余年来判断古代史实的真伪，全“折衷于孔子”，又相信“六艺”为孔子的著作，所以太史公著“史记” 对于古史总是“考信于六艺”。自此以后，总是合乎经的为真，不合乎经的为伪。儒家承孔子的传统，不喜欢谈神说怪，所以他们所保存的历史传说，对神话传说删除不少。经书内所保存的史料相当人化，与当时人知的发达程度相适合。秦汉以后的儒者极大多数已不知道先秦诸子惋惜古初的真正意义，却承受贵古贱今的传统，于是古代的人物愈来愈理想化，使古代成了高不可攀的盛世。十七世纪王船山，才明确地认识这样理想化的不合史实。他指出尧、舜、禹时代的各国不过是明末云贵诸省土司的情形。唐虞以前的社会不如唐虞以后，“三代盛世”不及三代以后。人类不惟知识进步，就是道德方面，由于历代圣贤的努力也是逐渐进步的。这是很有见地的思想。
    到本世纪初，我们受到欧西学术的影响，更明了那样理想化的古代绝不合于历史发展的阶段。当日旧封建势力还没有大动摇，旧偶像的威力还相当强大，而最大的偶像就是尧、舜、禹、孔子诸人。所以到本世纪二十年代初，打倒偶像的呼声遂高唱入云。孔子年代较近，事迹较明，只能否定他的学说，无法否定他的人格。前三人的年代较远，所传的事迹矛盾很多，神话很浓，于是他们的人格的存在也成了大问题。关于尧、舜、禹比较不太茫昧的传说已经如此，他们以前更茫昧的传说，更当一笔抹杀，使他们不要再混入历史的范围。这就是极端疑古派的主张。在1930年前后，真正的历史工作者对于殷墟以前的历史，除了辨伪工作以外，几乎不敢开口。少数的人虽然还有一些工作，但为历史界大部分人所能接受的意见几乎完全没有。少数唯物主义派的历史工作者虽然也不同意这种阉割历史的做法，可是还没有工夫对于我国的传说史料的处理问题作出正确的研究和结论。二十年代至四十年代前期可以说是疑古派全盛时代。
    全国解放后，历史学界对历史唯物主义展开热烈的学习，渐渐晓得疑古派对于古代历史的研究虽异常努力，也获得了相当的成绩，可是他们的看法还太简单化，还太片面；明白了我们从古代遗留下来的一切传说，虽说由于口耳相传过久，失真的地方很多，大多数还保有一个历史的核心，未可忽视。现在历史界对于传说时代的史料的态度大致可以分为两大类：一为开始引用传说的史料或试用社会发展史观点解释古代的传说或神话，他们所用的方法还有值得讨论的地方；一为虽然承认疑古派错误颇多，不愿意再跟着他们走，可是受他们的影响很深，短时还不能消除，觉得虽说传说里面或许保有一个历史的核心，可是材料过少，真伪莫明，暂且不谈，等着将来地下材料肯定它或者否定它以后再谈，或者可以少犯点错误。对于持后一种态度的人，我现在仅说几句话，就是古代传说都有渊源。如小屯殷墟的名字实本于史记项羽本纪：“乃与期洹水南殷墟上”的文字，而殷墟在太史公记录以前，也不过是民间的传说。古传说固然需要考古工作的证明或否定，而考古工作也很需要古传说的指引，等着考古工作作好以后再谈古传说的思想是不对的。
    对于那些开始引用传说史料的人们所用的方法，我认为可以讨论的地方有下面数点：
    第一，引用“正经”或“正史”上所载的史料以前并没有经过一次审慎的批判，或者他们的批判仅限于表面上太不合理的地方，如说“乘龙而至四海”，夏禹时“厥贡璆，铁”等等。至于这些“正经”和“正史”的基本性质，他们对它并不怀疑，我们以为这种态度是不对的。现在已经没有人否认我国古代在汉族形成以前，有好几个氏族集团，可是这些原始族类的分别在正经和正史的史料里面一点也看不出来。按着“正经”“正史”来说，这些氏族集团是很有系统的，古先圣帝明王们是一脉相承的（就政治系统说，不是血统说），几乎可以说当日是大一统的，这当然是不正确的。“正经”“正史”都是经过后儒系统化了的。像尚书中的尧典、皋陶谟、禹贡三篇并不写于夏、商，不写于西周，却是由春秋和战国时的人集合起来，并且逐渐改正，才成了现在的样子。这种系统化的材料经过综合删改，就逐渐失真，其可靠性的程度要比保存在“左传”、“国语”、先秦诸子以及其他先秦古书中的零金碎玉、不成系统的材料的可靠性差得多，所以简单的称引正经或正史的说法是不适宜的。
    第二，看见考古材料或民族学材料同古传说相合，不仔细考虑它们的时代关系，就互相比附。比方说看见中国猿人的坑穴中有用火的痕迹，就与燧人氏的传说相比附。其实我们现在所保存的古代传说大致都是几千年内的，印象最深流传最久的传说也许能保存到几万年。至于保存到五六十万年的长时期那几乎是不可能的。燧人氏或者指一氏族，或者指一时代，似乎并不出于思想家的臆测，而出于远古的真正传说。它所指的并不是人类开始使用天然火，而是开始用钻燧的方法磨擦取火。从利用天然火到人力取火一定要经过一段绵长的时期。我们臆测这一进步总在真人出现以后（近十几万年）。所以周口店下层洞穴中用火的痕迹和燧人氏的传说并无联系。
    又如看见甲骨文中对父称的不确定性就推论到“普那路亚”家族。实则“普那路亚”式的群婚形式远在蒙昧时代。至于殷的末叶如果用恩格斯的分期办法，当在野蛮时代的中级阶段，中间相差很远。看我国殷墟以前相当长时期的传说，似乎在尧、舜、禹的时代已经早进入对偶家族阶段。说殷末叶对父称的不确定为“普那路亚”家族时代的习惯遗留或者可以，要证明当日仍在“普那路亚”家族阶段，决不可通。直到现在，在我们的家乡南阳一带还有一种风气，把自己的父亲叫作伯或叔。一个生人到一人家中，单听小孩子们的称呼无法判断谁是谁的儿子。如果从这一现象就判断我们家乡现在还在“普那路亚”家族阶段，岂不是一件大笑话。
    最奇怪的是想解说淮南子中“天柱折、地维绝”“天不兼复、地不周载、火爁炎而不灭，水浩洋而不息”的神话，却引证到地质学中所谈的地形的大变化。这种大变化又不是新生代第四纪的，而是古生代和中生代或新生代初期的。称引这些有什么用处呢？最早的人类是在新生代第四纪初期发生，离现在不能超过一百万年。至于古生代开始于二十万万年以前，结束于几万万年以前。中生代也结束于几千万年以前。这时候初有哺乳动物，灵长类还没有出现，何况人类！近百万年来在地质方面没有很大的变化。在中国猿人时代以后，并无造山的大运动，也不会引起“火爁炎而不灭、水浩洋而不息”的神话。引证地质学上的地形变化对于解释上述神话毫无用处。所以对于时间的前后长短没有比较明了的概念，一见着相近的说法就拿来互相比拟，不是真正科学的态度。
    试着用社会发展史的方法和材料解释古代的传说或神话本是一个正确的方向，可是单说社会发展史的方法还太笼统，不够具体，所用的方法也有可以讨论的地方。主要的是常常不把纯粹的神话和掺杂神话的历史传说分开。这一种混乱是从疑古派承袭来的。疑古派因为对于这一点不清楚，所以走到一笔抹杀的结果。把掺杂的神话误认为历史固然是太天真，可是因为不信任神话就连被神话包围的历史因素也抛弃掉，那也是要泼脏水连小孩也泼掉的办法。荷马史诗、伊里亚特和奥得赛里面所叙述的事实，神话气味十分浓重，可是现在有考古工作的证明，历史家完全相信这一长期战争的确实存在，并且还要从它的叙述里面寻找当日社会的结构和习惯等等。
    我国纯粹的神话不多，只有“天日高一丈，地日厚一丈，盘古日长一丈”一类的话才是。至于炎帝、黄帝、蚩尤、太昊以及其他古帝的传说，它的神奇意味比伊里亚特中的英雄们还相差很远，怎么能把他看作纯粹的神话呢！必须把这二种，划分清楚，然后才可以渐渐地找出他们真正的意义。
    其次，他们对于神话和掺杂神话的历史传说自身的变化注意不够，常常把最早的朴素的神话或传说与最后越来变化越多的神话或传说等量齐观。其实较古的传说去古还近，失真还比较少，从它推测失真前的质素还比较容易。至于晚出的关于古代的传说，虽然也有古传说作蓝本，可是已经一改、再改、三改，原来可靠的质素几乎完全无存，从那里面无法找出来真正历史的因素。就是找出来一点，也是不可靠的。比如有人拿宋朝罗泌“路史”的说法作为古传说，殊不知罗氏在著作的时候先有几个固定的成见。第一，他相信中国远古就是统一的，因而古帝是继续无间断的。第二，他不认识神话来自多元，有的可靠有的不可靠，只要看见一种传说，就把他当作宝贝。第三，我国远古时代的人名、氏族名和地名常常不分，罗氏却不注意这一点，遇到说不通时就妄改古书。罗泌的“路史”很有趣，应该研究，并不是因为它可靠，却是因为它可以说是最后一次所作的综合性的工作。他并且把材料的来源在注里面大致全告诉了我们。我们仔细看它的注，就可以推测到他的工作是怎样作的，是怎样删改损益的。我们就可以由这部书推测到较古的综合材料是怎样成功的，是有什么样价值的。我们研究传说史料的人无分别地把“路史”这一类书中晚出的材料混在古传说中，等量齐观，却想由此猜测历史的真相，我们以为这是不可能的。
    要之，我们现在想研究传说的史料，第一是要把先秦的材料和秦汉以后的材料分别清楚。前一种是主要的，可作标识的，后一种仅可作辅助的。第二、在先秦材料中必须分别综合材料和未经系统化的材料。综合整理后一种材料，拿他作标准，来审查前一种材料内那一部分可靠，那一部分不可靠。第三，秦汉以后的材料去古还不远，或有不传于今而当时还能见到的材料，只要他们还未受前期综合材料错误部分的影响，也还可以采用。最后谯周、皇甫谧、郦道元诸人虽史识不高，而对于古传说搜集很勤，他们所记的逸事，只要他与先秦未受系统化的材料不冲突，也可以取备参考。至于此后书中所记的古史材料，应当一笔勾消，以免眩惑视听。这几条规则固然太简单，不足以胜处理传说史料的重任，但都是应该特别注意的基本规则。现在特别提出，希望大家考虑、讨论、补正，如能得一套完整的处理传说史料的方法，实属万幸。
    处理传说史料的参考资料，从资本主义国家学者的著作翻译成中文的现在还有几本，可是从苏联或其他社会主义国家翻译过来的现在还没有见到。现在国内作这一类研究的，所引用的大约是前一种的书籍。这一部分著作一般说来材料大部分还是可靠的，有参考价值的。可是它里面的理论，大多浸染唯心主义的色彩，这就是说它们的证据并不充分，多由臆测得出结论，没有真实可靠的科学价值。苏联及其他社会主义国家对于这一方面的研究并非重点，著作或不太多，但是总也应该有一些。它受马克思列宁主义实事求是精神的指导，所得的结论一定比较可靠得多。希望早日翻译出若干部，以正确的马克思列宁主义的著作相引导，使我国关于传说时代的史料研究可以更迅速地进步，那就更好了。
