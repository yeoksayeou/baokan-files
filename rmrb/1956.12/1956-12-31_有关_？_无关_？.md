　　“Relevant”? “Irrelevant”?
　　Should agricultural technical personnel be transferred to do work unrelated to production technology?
　　The important thing is to clarify what is meant by "relevant" and what is meant by "irrelevant." In general, transferring agricultural technical personnel to do work such as river management, road construction, and immigration can undoubtedly be said to be "irrelevant," and should undoubtedly be opposed. (In special circumstances, such as when the water situation is very tense and local people and cadres need to go all out to manage rivers, a different approach should naturally be taken.)
　　There are also some tasks, such as consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives, and socialist propaganda campaigns concentrated in a certain period, which agricultural technical personnel, if they draw a very narrow circle around their work, may seem to consider "irrelevant." In fact, with a little more thought, one can understand: they are very "relevant." If agricultural technical personnel are needed to participate, it should be their unshirkable duty.
　　Generally speaking, the current situation is that more agricultural technicians are being transferred to do things that are indeed irrelevant to their work. Why do all counties and districts demand the establishment of agricultural technology extension stations, but once they are established, they are not allowed to do technical work properly? To answer this question, the leading comrades of the county and district committees in the areas where this is happening need to think first about their own views on agricultural production and technology extension. It is very possible that they also regard these tasks as largely "irrelevant," or "irrelevant" to their own work!

### “有关”？“无关”？

    “有关”？“无关”？
    该不该调农业技术工作人员去做与生产技术无关的工作？
    要紧的是弄清什么叫做“有关”，什么叫做“无关”。在一般情况下，把农业技术工作人员调去做治河、修路、移民等等工作，无疑地可以说是“无关”，也无疑地应该反对。（在特殊情况下，例如水情十分紧张，需要当地群众和干部全力以赴去治河，自然应该另作别论。）
    还有一些工作，例如巩固农业生产合作社、集中在一个时期进行的社会主义宣传运动等等，如果农业技术工作人员把自己的工作的圈子划得很狭小，似乎也可以认为是“无关”的事。其实，稍多想一想，就可以了解：甚为“有关”。如果需要农业技术工作人员参加，那应该是义不容辞的。
    一般地说，目前的情况是调农业技术人员去做与他们的工作确实无关的事情比较多。为什么各县各区都要求建立农业技术推广站，建立起来了却又不让他们好好地做技术工作？要回答这个问题，需要请发生这种情况的地区的县委区委的领导同志先想一想：自己对于农业生产和技术推广工作到底是什么看法。很可能，他们把这些工作也是看作“无关”大体或者与他们自己的工作“无关”的吧！
