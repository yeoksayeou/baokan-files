    A Famous American Scientist Applies for Soviet Citizenship
    (Our Moscow Dispatch, December 20th) "I see my future in the Soviet Union," Professor Orest Michael, an American scientist, told a reporter from "Soviet Russia." Professor Michael and his wife, Dr. Oleksandra, recently renounced their American citizenship and applied to the Soviet Embassy in Stockholm for Soviet citizenship. They arrived in Moscow on December 15th.
    "Soviet Russia" published their photographs. Professor Michael is 47 years old and a world-renowned surveyor. He worked for a long time in the Geological Survey of the U.S. Department of the Interior and is an expert in cartography and aerial photography. He was one of the speakers of the American delegation at the Eighth International Congress of Surveyors in Stockholm.
    Professor Michael told "Soviet Russia" reporters on the 18th that he knows a little Russian, so it is possible to study Soviet publications on surveying. "After studying these books, I discovered that it is precisely in the Soviet Union that there are all the possibilities and conditions to study surveying—the science to which I have dedicated myself." He said that at the International Congress of Surveyors, he heard reports from Soviet scientists and felt that the Soviet Union was ahead of the United States in this area. "I saw your people, intelligent, kind, always ready to help others, and freely talking about things that are considered secret in the United States." He said: "I see my future as a scientist and educator in the Soviet Union." He wants to continue scientific research and teaching in the Soviet Union.

    美国一著名科学家申请取得苏联国籍
    本报莫斯科20日电　“我在苏联看到自己的未来”，这是美国科学家奥列斯特·迈克尔教授向“苏维埃俄罗斯报”记者说的。迈克尔教授和他的夫人奥列克山德娜医生，日前抛弃了美国国籍，向在斯德哥尔摩的苏联大使馆提出申请，要求取得苏联国籍，他们已经在12月15日到了莫斯科。
    “苏维埃俄罗斯报”刊登了他俩的照片。迈克尔教授四十七岁，是世界知名的测量学家，长期在美国内务部的地质局工作，是制图和空中摄影方面的专家。在斯德哥尔摩举行的第八届国际测量学会上他是美国代表团的报告人之一。
    迈克尔教授18日对“苏维埃俄罗斯报”记者说：他稍许知道俄文，所以有可能研究苏联出版的测量学的书籍，“在研究了这些书籍之后，我发现了，正是在苏联具备一切可能和条件来研究测量学——我所献身的科学。”他说：在国际测量学会上，他听到了苏联科学家的报告，觉得在这方面苏联已经走在美国前头，“我看到了你们的人，是聪明的，和蔼的，随时准备帮助别人的，并且自由地谈论那些在美国被认为秘密的东西。”他说：“我在苏联看到自己作为科学家和教育家的未来。”他想在苏联继续进行科学研究和教授工作。
