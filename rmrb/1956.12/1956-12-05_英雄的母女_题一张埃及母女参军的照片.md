Heroic Mother and Daughter
　　--Inscription on a Photo of an Egyptian Mother and Daughter Joining the Army
　　Li Zhi

　　The mother gazes at her daughter solemnly,
　　The daughter gazes at the rifle with a smile.
　　Is this how you pull back the bolt,
　　Dear mother, is this how you push the bullet into the chamber?
　　Yes, exactly like this,
　　My clever girl.
　　When I held you in my arms,
　　I never thought I'd be bringing you to the battlefield today.
　　The loving mother looks at her daughter, thinking,
　　I took her to the park,
　　I took her to the theater,
　　And I taught her to sing for happiness.
　　Now I bring my daughter into the ranks of the National Liberation Army,
　　To fight the invaders.
　　Heroic mother, heroic daughter,
　　To defend Egypt's freedom and independence,
　　To defend the beautiful parks and theaters,
　　For a peaceful life,
　　For the freedom to sing,
　　Solemnly take up your guns,
　　Happily take up your guns,
　　In the face of the enemy,
　　These pairs of women's hands
　　Will be as strong as steel!
