Xinhua News Agency, December 21st - A new vaccine for preventing hog cholera has been successfully tested.

This vaccine is called "Rabbit-Adapted Hog Cholera Attenuated Vaccine." It is produced by breeding on rabbits and is simple to make. Veterinarians inject this vaccine into pigs, and five to seven days later, the pigs develop a strong resistance to hog cholera, and the effect is quite long-lasting. This vaccine is also suitable for piglets around one month old.

Recently, the widespread trial use of this vaccine in rural areas of eleven provinces, including Jiangxi and Guangxi, has yielded excellent results and is very popular among farmers.

In the years since liberation, crystal violet vaccine has generally been used to prevent hog cholera. It is made from live pigs, the procedure is complicated, the cost is high, the efficacy is low, and the immunization period is short. The successful testing of the new vaccine provides good conditions for eliminating hog cholera in the future.

This vaccine is a new achievement of the scientific research work of the Veterinary Biological Products Supervision Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture.

    一种预防猪瘟的新疫苗
    新华社21日讯　一种新的预防猪瘟的疫苗试验成功。
    这种疫苗叫“兔化猪瘟弱毒疫苗”，它是在家兔身上繁殖制成的，制作简便。兽医人员在猪身上注射这种疫苗，五天到七天以后，猪就产生了对猪瘟的坚强的抵抗力，而且效力相当持久。这种疫苗对一个月左右的小猪也适用。
    最近在江西、广西等十一个省的广大农村中推广试用这种疫苗，效果很好，很受农民欢迎。
    解放后几年来，预防猪瘟一般用结晶紫疫苗。它是用生猪制造的，手续复杂，成本较高，效力低，免疫期也短。新疫苗试验成功，使今后消灭猪瘟有了良好的条件。
    这种疫苗是农业部兽医生物药品监察所科学研究工作的新成就。
