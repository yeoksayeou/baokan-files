　　Guangxi Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture is the most populous autonomous prefecture in China. The prefecture includes more than ten ethnic groups, including Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, and Han, with a total population of more than 8.8 million. Among them, the Zhuang people account for two-thirds of the total population of the prefecture. In the four years since the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, due to the implementation of the Party and government's ethnic policies and the strengthening of ethnic unity, various construction undertakings have been continuously advancing.

　　在广西省桂西僮族自治州
    广西省桂西僮族自治州是我国人口最多的一个民族自治州。全州包括有僮、瑶、苗、侗、汉等十多个民族共八百八十多万人。其中僮族占全州总人口的三分之二。桂西僮族自治州成立四年来，由于贯彻执行了党和政府的民族政策，加强了民族团结，各项建设事业不断在前进中。（附图片）
