Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Xinhua News Agency reporter Lü Xinchu reported: Academic activities are unprecedentedly prosperous this year. According to preliminary statistics, more than 50 important national academic conferences were held throughout the year, more than in any previous year. Scientific workers presented more than 2,000 academic papers and reports.

Among the scientific papers and reports presented at various academic conferences, some were creative research results of scientific workers, some solved problems in production practice, and some belonged to newly developed disciplines since liberation. At the Second National Member Representative Congress and Paper Report Conference of the Chinese Chemical Society, chemists presented research results in several disciplines that had no foundation in China in the past but have only recently been developed, such as organoelement chemistry, free radical chemistry, and organic catalytic theory. A total of eighty-two papers were presented at this conference. The research on higher nervous activity, labor physiology, sports physiology, protein biochemistry, enzyme biochemistry, and traditional Chinese medicine presented at the Physiological Science Society Congress all reflected new research directions. The papers presented at the inaugural meeting of the Chinese Society for Metals on boron steel research, the application of energy consumption methods, the research on side-blown converter steel production, comprehensive utilization of resources, and improvement of rail quality, etc., some solved the urgent problems that need to be solved in the current metallurgical industry production, and some pointed out new research directions in metal science. The academic discussion meeting of the Chinese Textile Engineering Society focused on the design report of the ultra-large drafting device of the fine spinning machine. The result of this technological reform will enable textile factories to directly spin cotton slivers into fine yarns, eliminating the roving process, which can greatly increase labor productivity and reduce costs.

The genetics symposium held in Qingdao was a national academic conference of the Chinese scientific community to implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom." At this conference, in-depth discussions were conducted on theoretical issues that have been debated endlessly by the two major genetics schools in the international community for decades. Scientists gave full play to freedom of thought at the meeting. At this conference, scholars from the two schools learned from each other's strengths, understood each other's situation, and achieved the effect of learning from each other's strengths, overcoming shortcomings, and enhancing unity. Other examples include the debate at the Chinese Geographical Society Congress on whether physical geography and economic geography can form a comprehensive geography and the research object of economic geography, the debate at the Zoological Society on whether sparrows are harmful birds, the debate at the Chinese Natural Science History Symposium on the history of Chinese mathematics and astronomy, and the discussion on grammar at the grammar symposium, all of which embodied the spirit of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom." The archaeological work conference jointly convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Culture was also an academic working conference. It estimated the important archaeological excavations and their value in the past six years; listened to twenty-six special reports, and launched academic free debates.

The inaugural meetings of the academic committees of the seventeen research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held this year successively reviewed the research work of the past few years, clarified the future research directions and specific tasks, and listened to and discussed many academic papers presented by researchers. Some scientific work conferences convened by industrial departments also presented scientific papers and reports and conducted discussions.

Among the scientific discussions held in universities, the flotation discussion held by the Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy was the first mineral processing professional discussion held in our country. Scientific workers from 20 units including scientific research institutions, universities, design institutions, factories and mines participated in the discussion.

The authors of the thousands of papers and reports presented at the above-mentioned academic conferences are distributed in various regions of the country. Regions with no scientific foundation or very weak foundations before liberation, such as the Northwest region and small and medium-sized cities such as Hefei, also had scientific workers presenting academic papers or reports this year. Scientific workers from Hong Kong, Macau, and Tibetan medical personnel also participated in the representative congress of the Chinese Medical Association. Among the authors of these papers and reports, young scientific workers accounted for a considerable proportion. According to the statistics of the Chinese Mathematical Society, more than 40% of the authors of mathematical papers presented at academic conferences this year were young people. Senior mathematicians believe that this is a very gratifying phenomenon in the Chinese mathematical community. Chen Jingrun, who graduated from the Department of Mathematics of the University only three years ago, presented a paper on "He Li," which made some progress in Hua Luogeng's research results.

Scientists who have returned from the United States and other countries in recent years are active members of academic activities. At the genetics symposium, biologists Shi Luji, Sheng Zujia, Zhao Baoguo, and Liu Zudong, who returned from the United States, were all active participants in the debate. At the inaugural meeting of the academic committee of the Institute of Applied Physics, the paper presented by metallurgist Chen Nengkuan and his collaborators, who returned from the United States last winter, introduced their research on the mechanical properties of ultrapure aluminum refined by the physical method of zone melting. This is the achievement Chen Nengkuan made in a short period of time after returning to China.

    贯彻百家争鸣方针　充分发挥自由思想
    学术研究工作空前活跃
    新华社21日讯　新华社记者吕新初报道：今年学术活动空前繁荣。一年中举行的比较重要的全国性学术会议，据初步统计有五十多次，多于过去任何一年。科学工作者提出的学术论文和报告共有两千篇以上。
    在各次学术会议上提出的科学论文和报告中，有的是科学工作者创造性的研究成果，有的解决了生产实践中的问题，有的属于解放后新开辟的学科。在中国化学会第二届全国会员代表大会及论文报告会上，化学家提出了过去我国没有基础、最近才开展起来的若干学科的研究结果，例如元素有机化合物化学、游离基化学、有机催化理论等。这次会上提出的论文一共有八十二篇。在生理科学会代表大会上提出的高级神经活动、劳动生理学、运动生理学、蛋白质的生物化学、酶的生物化学和中药等研究，都体现了新的研究方向。中国金属学会成立大会上提出的关于硼钢的研究、力耗方法的应用、侧吹转炉钢生产的研究、资源综合利用和提高钢轨质量的研究等论文，有的解决了当前冶金工业生产中亟需解决的问题，有的指出了金属科学中新的研究方向。中国纺织工程学会学术讨论会着重研究了精纺机的超大牵伸装置的设计的报告。这一技术改革的结果，将使纺织厂用棉条直接纺成细纱而省去粗纱工序，可以大大提高劳动生产率和降低成本。
    在青岛举行的遗传学座谈会是中国科学界贯彻百家争鸣方针的全国性学术会议。这次会议对几十年来国际上两个遗传学派争论不休的理论问题进行了缜密的探讨。科学家们在会上充分发挥了自由思想。在这次会上，两派学者互相学到了长处，互相了解了情况，收到了取长补短、共同提高、增强团结的效果。其他如中国地理学会代表大会关于自然地理和经济地理能否组成一个综合性的地理学以及经济地理学的研究对象两个问题的争论，动物学会关于麻雀是不是害鸟的争论，中国自然科学史讨论会关于中国数学史和天文学史方面的争论，语法座谈会关于语法的讨论等，都体现了百家争鸣的精神。中国科学院和文化部联合召开的考古工作会议也是一个学术性的工作会议，它对六年来的重要考古发掘及其价值作了估计；听取了二十六篇专题报告，并且展开了学术性的自由争论。
    今年先后举行的中国科学院十七个研究机构的学术委员会成立大会，大多检阅了过去几年来的研究工作，明确了今后的研究方向和具体任务，并且听取和讨论了研究人员提出的许多学术论文。有的产业部门召开的科学工作会议也提出了科学论文和报告，并进行了讨论。
    在高等学校举行的科学讨论会中，中南矿冶学院举行的浮选讨论会是我国首次举行的选矿专业讨论会。科学研究机关、高等学校、设计机关、厂矿等二十个单位的科学工作者参加了这次讨论。
    在上述这些学术会议上提出的几千篇论文和报告的作者，分布在全国各个地区。解放前没有科学基础或基础十分薄弱的地区，例如西北地区和合肥等中小城市，今年也有科学工作者提出了学术论文或报告。中华医学会的代表大会还有香港、澳门的科学工作者和藏族医务人员参加。在这些论文和报告的作者中，青年科学工作者占了相当大的比重。据中国数学会的统计，今年在学术会议上提出的数学论文的作者中有40％以上是青年人。老数学家都认为这是中国数学界十分可喜的现象。从大学数学系毕业才三年的陈景润提出的一篇关于“他利”的论文，对华罗庚的研究结果有了一些推进。
    近年来从美国和其他国家回国的科学家是学术活动中的活跃分子。在遗传学座谈会上，从美国回来的生物学家施履吉、盛祖嘉、赵保国、刘祖洞等人都是争论的积极分子。在应用物理研究所学术委员会成立大会上，去年冬天从美国回来的冶金学家陈能宽和他的合作者提出的论文，介绍了他们用区域熔化的物理方法提炼超纯铝进行力学性质研究的情况。这是陈能宽回国后短短的时间内作出的成绩。
