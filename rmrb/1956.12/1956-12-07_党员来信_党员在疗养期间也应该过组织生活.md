　　Party Member's Letter
　　Party Members Should Participate in Organizational Activities Even During Recuperation
To the Editor:
    I came to the Xingcheng Sanatorium in Liaoning at the end of August. Shortly after entering the sanatorium, I was elected as the director of the Recuperation Committee of the Third Recuperation Area. According to the regulations of the recuperation area, the evaluation of non-Party and non-League recuperators upon discharge must include opinions and signatures from the director of the Recuperation Committee, along with an official stamp. Once, a recuperator came to me with an evaluation form from his group, asking for my opinion and stamp. However, I noticed that the "Party or League Member" section on the evaluation form was filled with the words "Communist Party Member," so I told him that the evaluation of a Party member should ultimately be handled by the branch secretary. He said that his Party organizational affiliation had not been transferred here. At the time, I assumed he was only staying temporarily, so I casually asked him when he had been admitted. His answer was quite surprising: almost three and a half months ago.
    In the past two months or so, I have encountered similar situations four times. When I asked them how long they had been hospitalized, the shortest was three months, and the longest was four or five months. When I asked about the reasons for not transferring their Party organizational affiliation, some said "because it's a sanatorium," some said "it's not a work position," and some even said bluntly "because after joining the Party, I've only ever participated in organizational activities, and this time I'm here to recuperate and relax."
    Article 12 of the Party Constitution stipulates: "If a Party member fails to participate in Party activities or pay Party dues for six months without a valid reason, he shall be deemed to have voluntarily withdrawn from the Party..." I believe that the reasons given by those recuperators mentioned above for not participating in organizational activities cannot be considered valid, because those who come to sanatoriums for recuperation are all chronic patients. Since they can fish, play poker, and play ball every day, why can't they participate in organizational activities?
    They themselves are certainly responsible for this undesirable phenomenon, but the Party organizations in their work units are also responsible. Why don't they supervise and stop such behavior of Party members? On the contrary, they adopt a tacit or supportive attitude?

### 党员来信　党员在疗养期间也应该过组织生活

　　党员来信
　　党员在疗养期间也应该过组织生活编辑同志：
    我是8月底来辽宁兴城疗养院的。入院不久，就被选为第三疗养区休养委员会的主任委员。根据疗养区的制度，凡是非党非团的疗养员出院的鉴定，都要由休养委员会主任提意见并签名盖章。一次一个疗养员拿着小组的鉴定表来要我提意见、盖章，但是，我发现在鉴定表上的“是否党团员”栏内填着“共产党员”四个字，就告诉他党员的鉴定最后应由支部书记提意见、盖章。他说他的党的组织关系没有转来。当时我以为他是临时住院的，就随口问了一下他是什么时候入院的，答复很叫人吃惊：将近三个半月了。
    类似这样的情况，两个多月中，我碰到了四次。问问他们住院的时间，短的是三个月，长的是四、五个月，问起不转党的组织关系的理由来，有人说“因为是疗养”，有人说“不是工作岗位”，有人甚至干脆说“因为入党后净过组织生活，这回来疗养该轻快、轻快了”。
    党章第十二条规定：“党员没有正当理由，六个月不参加党的生活，或者不交纳党费的，就被认为自行脱党……。”我认为上面所说的那些疗养员不过组织生活的理由是不能算作正当的，因为到疗养院来疗养的都是慢性病人，既然他们每天可以、钓鱼、打扑克、打球为什么就不能过组织生活吗？
    这种不好的现象他们本人固然有责任，他们工作单位的党组织，也有责任，为什么不对党员的这种行为进行监督、制止？相反，还采取默许或支持的态度呢？
