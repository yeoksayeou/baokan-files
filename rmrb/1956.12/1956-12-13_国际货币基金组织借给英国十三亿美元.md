Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 11th - The Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund, Per Jacobsson, announced on the evening of the 10th that the organization would offer a loan of $1.3 billion to "help" Britain weather the financial crisis it encountered as a result of launching the war of aggression against Egypt.

The organization said that $561,470,000 of this amount is to be used to increase Britain's monetary reserves needed to meet international payments, and the remaining $738,530,000 is for the British government to use within the next twelve months.

The International Monetary Fund's loan was granted at the request of the British government.

(Editor's note) The International Monetary Fund was created by the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in 1944. Fifty-five countries participate in this organization, but the Soviet Union did not. It was originally intended to adjust monetary relations between countries and promote the development of international trade, but in reality, from the beginning, it became a tool for the United States to control the finances of other capitalist countries. The capital of the International Monetary Fund is shared by its member countries, with the United States holding the largest share at $2.75 billion, the United Kingdom at $1.3 billion, and France at $525 million. The organization has the right to review the exchange rate changes of member countries. Member countries must obtain the organization's consent when exchange rate changes exceed 10%. It can also lend foreign exchange to member countries necessary for temporarily adjusting balance of payments. These loans are actually issued according to the instructions of the U.S. representatives and have been mainly used to repay some countries for military equipment and other materials imported from the United States in the past.

    国际货币基金组织
    借给英国十三亿美元
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：国际货币基金组织执行董事佩尔·雅各布逊10日晚上宣布，这个组织提出十三亿美元的借款，来“帮助”英国捱过因为它发动侵略埃及的战争而遭遇的财政危机。
    这个组织说，这个数目中的五亿六千一百四十七万美元是用来增加英国偿付国际支付需要的货币储备，另外七亿三千八百五十三万美元供英国政府在今后的十二个月内动用。
    国际货币基金组织的借款是应英国政府的请求给予的。
    （编者注）国际货币基金组织是1944年联合国货币金融会议产生的。参加这个组织的有五十五个国家，苏联没有参加。它原是为了调整各国间的货币关系，促进国际贸易的发展，但是，实际上从一开始就成为美国控制其他资本主义国家的金融的工具。国际货币基金的资本由各会员国分摊，其中美国占有最大的份额，共二十七亿五千万美元，英国是十三亿美元，法国是五亿二千五百万美元。这个组织有权审查会员国货币汇价变动的问题。会员国的汇价变动超过10％时必须取得这个组织的同意。它还可以借给会员国为了暂时调整支付平衡所必须的外汇。这种借款实际上是依照美国代表的指示来发放的，过去主要给一些国家用来偿付从美国输入的军备和其他物资。
