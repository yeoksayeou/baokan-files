　　Be Prudent, But Don't Be Timid

　　The Bai Cheng Special District in Jilin Province, a dry and sandy area, had a bumper harvest of over 12,000 hectares of sugar beets this year for the first time. This is one example of the successful reform of agricultural production.

　　The Jilin Provincial Leadership decided to gradually transfer sugar beet production from the central grain-producing areas to the west. This is a bold and progressive plan. It was not decided rashly on a whim, but after careful investigation and research into the specific conditions of other places and the local area. Their success is due to more than just this. In the process of implementing the plan, they did not adopt a simplistic approach; they did a lot of concrete organizational work (for example, sending people to other places to learn about high-yield sugar beet experiences, inviting people from other places to provide guidance, etc.), and effectively helped farmers in the Bai Cheng area learn the techniques of large-scale sugar beet cultivation.

　　It is necessary to be prudent when it comes to reforms in agricultural production. However, if "prudence" turns into timidity, that would also be a mistake. Some people, because the results of agricultural production reforms in some areas this year have not been entirely satisfactory, are afraid to reform boldly anymore. What should be done? Please take a look at the example of the Bai Cheng Special District!

### 要慎重，但不要胆怯

　  要慎重，但不要胆怯
    干旱而多风砂的吉林省白城专区，今年第一次种植的一万二千多公顷甜菜丰收了，这是农业生产改革成功的例证之一。
    吉林省领导机关决定把甜菜生产由中部产粮区逐步转移到西部去，这是一个大胆的进取的规划。这不是单凭一时热情轻率决定的，而是多次细心调查研究了外地和本地的具体情况的结果。他们得到成功的原因，还不止于此。在把规划付诸实行的过程中，他们没有采取简单化的作法；它们做了不少具体的组织工作（例如，派人到外地去学习甜菜丰产经验，从外地请人来指导等等），切实帮助白城地区农民学会了大面积种植甜菜的技术。
    用慎重的态度对待农业生产上的改革，是必要的。但是，如果“慎重”到胆怯的地步，那就也是谬误的了。有些人因为一些地区今年实行农业生产改革的结果不尽如意，就不敢再大胆改革了。怎么办呢？请看看白城专区这个事例吧！
