Xinhua News Agency, Jinan - Shandong Province currently raises 5.7 million hogs, an increase of 37% compared to the same period last year; the number of hogs purchased has also greatly increased.

In the second half of this year, Shandong Province implemented the method of "private ownership, private raising, public assistance," establishing sow breeding farms within agricultural cooperatives to breed piglets for cooperative members, unified the allocation of feed for cooperative members raising pigs, and regularly provided epidemic prevention for pigs raised by cooperative members, solving the difficulties of cooperative members' household pig raising in many ways, which enabled the province's pig raising industry to develop rapidly. Shouzhang County, for example, increased the number of fattened pigs raised ninefold in one year by implementing the method of private raising as the main method, with the cooperative breeding and households raising.

This year, Shandong Province advocated the extensive use of coarse feed and the promotion of "fine feeding of coarse feed" to solve the problem of pig feed. At the pig raising and manure accumulation conference held by the Provincial Department of Agriculture this spring, hundreds of model breeders from the province exchanged more than 120 methods for collecting, making, and feeding coarse feed. After these methods were promoted in many places, fine feeding of coarse feed was achieved, and the effect was very good.

In addition, Shandong Province has also adjusted the purchase price of hogs twice this year, and many agricultural cooperatives have increased the purchase price of manure; strengthened the work of pig epidemic prevention and control, and universally carried out mass pig raising competitions, and a large number of pig raising experts have been rewarded. All of these have directly promoted the development of the pig raising industry.

The relevant负责人 (fù zé rén - person in charge) of the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture said that although the number of hogs has increased this year, the problems of feed and purchase prices have not been completely resolved, and the enthusiasm of the masses for raising pigs has not been fully utilized. Therefore, to launch a truly mass pig raising movement throughout the province, greater efforts must be made in the future.

In late November, the province averaged only more than 3,000 pigs purchased per day. Entering mid-December, the average daily purchase volume increased to 9,100. Linyi Prefecture, where pig production is relatively concentrated, had completed 80% of its full-month purchase plan by December 15. The province's purchase volume more than doubled compared to the same period last year.

Recently, the work of purchasing live pigs in Shandong Province has been greatly improved. In the past, many purchasers did not go to mountainous areas and areas with inconvenient transportation to purchase, and the purchase conditions were very strict, such as not accepting coarse-haired, large-clawed pigs, or pigs with poor hair color, resulting in many farmers not being able to sell their pigs after they were fattened. Now the purchase requirements have been relaxed, and purchase units in many areas have begun to go deep into mountainous and marginal areas to purchase. Many farmers in the Yimeng Mountains sell their fattened pigs without going down the mountains.

Now, a large number of fattened pigs are being rushed to Beijing to supply the capital's people to celebrate the New Year and Spring Festival. According to the plan of Shandong Provincial Food Company, from now until the Spring Festival, an average of more than 1,000 pigs will be transported to Beijing every day; the quality of the pigs is also quite good, with weights mostly over 100 jin, among which the hogs purchased from Linyi, Jining and other areas are particularly thick and fleshy.

### 社里繁殖分户养　统一安排猪饲料  山东现养生猪五百七十万头  全省收购量比去年同期增长一倍多

    社里繁殖分户养　统一安排猪饲料
    山东现养生猪五百七十万头
    全省收购量比去年同期增长一倍多
    据新华社济南电　山东省目前喂养的生猪有五百七十万头，比去年同期增加了37％；生猪收购数量也大大增加了。
    今年下半年，山东省贯彻执行“私有、私养、公助”的办法，在农业社内设立母猪繁殖场，繁殖仔猪供应社员，统一安排社员养猪的饲料，并且定期为社员养的猪防疫，从多方面解决社员家庭养猪的困难，才使全省养猪事业有了较快的发展。寿张县就是由于实行了以私养为主、社繁户养的办法，在一年中使喂养的毛猪增加了九倍。
    山东省今年提倡大量利用粗饲料和推广“粗料细喂”的办法来解决养猪饲料问题。在今春省农业厅召开的养猪积肥会议上，全省几百名模范饲养员交流了一百二十多种粗饲料采集、制做和喂养办法，很多地方推广这些办法以后，做到了粗料细喂，效果很好。
    另外，今年山东省还先后两次调整了毛猪收购价格，很多农业社提高了粪肥的收价；加强了猪疫防治工作，普遍开展了群众性的养猪评比工作，大批养猪能手受到了奖励。所有这些，都直接推动了养猪事业的发展。
    山东省农业厅的有关负责人说，今年毛猪虽有增加，但是饲料和收购价格问题还没有彻底解决，群众养猪的积极性还远没有充分发挥，因此，要在全省范围内展开一个真正群众性的养猪运动，今后还必须作更大的努力。
    11月下旬，全省平均每天只能收购三千多头猪，进入12月中旬，平均每天收购量增加到九千一百头。产猪比较集中的临沂专区，到12月15日已经完成全月收购计划80％。全省收购量比去年同期增长一倍多。
    近来山东省收购生猪的工作有了不少改进。过去许多收购人员不到山区和交通不便的地区去收购，收购条件也很严格，如粗毛大爪的不收，毛色不好的不收，结果农民有很多猪喂肥了以后卖不出去。现在收购要求放宽了，许多地区的收购单位开始深入到山区和边沿地区收购。沂蒙山区有很多农民，不下山就把肥猪卖出去了。
    现在大批肥猪正赶运北京，供应首都人民欢度新年和春节。根据山东省食品公司的计划，从目前到春节以前，平均每天有一千多头猪运到北京；猪的质量也相当好，体重大都在百斤以上，其中由临沂、济宁一带收购的毛猪，更是膘厚肉肥。
