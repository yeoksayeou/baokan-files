    Further Strengthen Sino-German Cultural Cooperation
    Written to Celebrate the First Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation
    Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture of the People’s Republic of China
    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic in 1949 marked a turning point in European history, and the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and German people also advanced to a new historical stage. During this period, our two countries have done a lot of valuable work in politics, economy, culture and other aspects, which embodies the mutual support, cooperation and exchange between our countries. On December 25, 1955, the "Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic” was signed, which further consolidated and developed the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and German people, thereby greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the Chinese and German people in building socialism and promoting closer cooperation between the two peoples in the great cause of building socialism and defending world peace.
    The intelligent and capable German people have made tremendous contributions to the development of world civilization for centuries. The scientific works of Marx and Engels are classics of the proletarian revolution and the international workers' movement. The music of Beethoven and Bach, the works of classical writers such as Goethe, Schiller, and Heine, and modern writers such as Anna Seghers are not only cherished by the German people, but also enrich the treasure house of world literature. People all over the world are proud of the German people's contribution to mankind. The Chinese people have high respect for the excellent traditional German culture.
    After the expiration of the cultural cooperation agreement signed by the Chinese and German governments on October 9, 1951, the Sino-German cultural cooperation agreement was renewed. This year, the delegation of the German Academy of Sciences headed by Steinmitz, Vice President of the German Academy of Sciences, visited China and signed the 1957-1958 Scientific Cooperation Agreement between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the German Academy of Sciences, which strengthened the planning of scientific cooperation between the two countries. In this year, the cooperation and exchanges in culture and art have also achieved good results. Just as the German people appreciate our classical art—the Peking Opera "Yandang Mountain" and "San Cha Kou", the Chinese people had the opportunity to hear the unforgettable performance of the Berlin People's Police Orchestra this year. In just two months, the Berlin People's Police Orchestra performed the works of German music masters Beethoven, Bach, and Strauss, as well as Chinese musical works such as "Yangko Dance", excerpts from "The White-Haired Girl", and "Ode to the Yellow River" for 180,000 listeners in twelve cities in China. This year, the Chinese Art Troupe that visited Germany for performances was well received by the German people in major cities of the German Democratic Republic and in Hamburg, Dusseldorf, Munich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and other cities of the German Federal Republic. The Chinese Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe also received good reviews from the German people during its visit to Germany this year. The exhibition of original works by the German sketch master Menzel in our country is a rare opportunity for Chinese audiences, especially for our art circles, to observe. Chinese writers Ba Jin and Zhou Libo visited Germany this year and participated in the Fourth German Writers' Congress. Chinese writer Wu Boxiao attended the Heine Research Association held in Weimar, and China's cultural circles solemnly held a memorial meeting in Beijing in May this year to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Heine's death. German writers Georg Maurer and Karl Mundstock were invited to participate in China's commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Lu Xun's death. China's achievements in culture, like its achievements in other fields, are inseparable from the help of various countries in the world, especially the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The cultural cooperation between our two countries has not only enhanced the friendship between the two peoples, but also promoted the common upsurge and prosperity of the two countries in cultural undertakings.
    Although the Chinese and German people speak different languages and are geographically far apart, we share the same aspirations and goals for consolidating world peace, seeking human progress, and building socialism. This is precisely the foundation of the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German people. We firmly believe that under the unity of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the people of our two countries will forever advance together on the road to victory. On the occasion of the first anniversary the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the People's Republic of China and German Democratic Republic, we sincerely congratulate the government and people of the German Democratic Republic on achieving greater and more brilliant achievements in socialist construction and in the struggle to strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

    进一步加强中德文化合作
    为庆祝中德友好合作条约签订一周年而作
    中华人民共和国文化部长　沈雁冰
    1949年德意志民主共和国的成立标志着欧洲历史的一个转捩点，由此中德两国人民的友谊与合作也推进到了一个新的历史阶段。在此期间我们两国之间在政治、经济、文化等各方面都做了许多极有价值的工作，体现了我们两国相互之间的支持、合作和交流。1955年12月25日又签订了
  “中华人民共和国德意志民主共和国友好合作条约”，它使中德两国人民的兄弟般的友谊得到了更进一步的巩固和发展，从而大大地鼓舞了中德两国人民建设社会主义的热情，推进了两国人民在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的伟大事业中更加亲密的合作。
    聪明而能干的德国人民在几个世纪中对世界文明的发展曾作出了巨大的贡献，马克思、恩格斯的科学著作是无产阶级革命和国际工人运动的经典。贝多芬和巴赫的乐曲，歌德、席勒和海涅等古典作家和现代作家安娜·西格斯等人的作品不但为德国人民爱不释手，而且也丰富了世界文学的宝库。全世界人民都为德国人民对人类的贡献而感到自豪。中国人民对具有优秀传统的德意志文化怀着崇高的敬意。
    在1951年10月9日中德两国政府所签订的文化合作协定有效期满以后，续订了中德文化合作协定。今年以德国科学院副院长斯坦因尼茨为首的德国科学院代表团访问了我国，与我国科学院签订了中国科学院德国科学院1957年—1958年科学合作协议，加强了两国科学合作的计划性。在这一年中，在文化、艺术方面的合作交流，也获得很好的效果。正像德国人民欣赏我国古典艺术——京剧中的“雁荡山”“三岔口”一样，中国人民在今年有机会听到柏林人民警察乐团的令人难忘的演奏。柏林人民警察乐团在短短的二个月中在我国十二个城市为十八万听众演奏了德国音乐大师贝多芬、巴赫、斯特劳斯的作品，和“秧歌舞曲”、“白毛女”选曲、“黄河颂”等我国的音乐作品。今年中国赴德作访问演出的中国艺术团在德意志民主共和国各大城市以及在德意志联邦共和国的汉堡、杜塞尔多夫、慕尼黑、法兰克福、斯图加特等城市的演出都受到了德国广大人民的赞赏。中国上海杂技团在今年访德演出期间也获得了德国人民的好评。德国素描大师门采尔的原作在我国的展出，对我国观众、尤其是对我国美术界说来是不易多得的观摩机会。中国作家巴金、周立波今年访问了德国，参加了第四届德国作家代表会议。我国作家吴伯肖出席了在魏玛举行的海涅研究会，我国文化界今年5月在北京隆重地举行了海涅逝世一百周年纪念大会。德国作家乔治·玛乌尔、卡尔·姆恩斯托克应邀参加了我国纪念鲁迅逝世二十周年。我国在文化方面的成就也和其他方面的成就一样，是和世界各国尤其是和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的帮助分不开的。我们两国之间的文化合作既增进了两国人民之间的友谊，又促进了两国在文化事业上的共同高涨和繁荣。
    中德两国人民虽然语言不同，地理上距离很远，但是我们对于巩固世界和平，谋求人类进步，建设社会主义的愿望和目标是共同的。这正是中德两国人民之间永恒的、牢不可破的友谊的基础。我们坚信，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结下，我们两国人民将在胜利的道路上永远共同前进。在中华人民共和国德意志民主共和国友好合作条约签订一周年的今天，我们衷心地祝贺德意志民主共和国政府和人民在社会主义建设和争取和平统一自己祖国的斗争中获得更大的更光辉的成就。
