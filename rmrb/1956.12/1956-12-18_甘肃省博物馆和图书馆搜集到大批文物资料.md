    (Our newspaper dispatch) Recently, the Gansu Provincial Museum and Library have collected a large number of precious revolutionary cultural relics and historical documents.
    The Gansu Provincial Museum collected a large number of revolutionary cultural relics from the Long March period in Lazikou and other places, which were strategically important passes that the Red Army passed through during the Long March. This batch of cultural relics includes more than one hundred types, scattered among the people in Zhuoni, Linze, Minxian, Linxia, and Xiahe counties. Among them are important documents, proclamations, certificates, slogans, as well as various currencies, damaged weapons, marching supplies, etc.
    In the notebooks of Red Army soldiers, there are records of the Party's policies on nationalities, religion, land reform, and women during the Long March, as well as instructions on mass work and troop discipline. On smoke-stained wooden boards, there are inspiring anti-Japanese and anti-Chiang Kai-shek slogans written by Red Army political workers, as well as news of victories from the First and Fourth Front Armies.
    On various proclamations, certificates, and receipts, there are signatures of leading comrades of the Red Army units and the seals of the units.
    The various currencies collected include four types: silver coins, copper coins, paper money, and cloth money, all of which were issued from 1932 to 1934.
    The Gansu Provincial Library has collected a large number of historical documents from the Qing Dynasty related to foreign affairs and ethnic issues, and is now accelerating the work of cataloging and collating them.
    Among these documents are "A Complete Record of the Northern Border Negotiations" concerning the treaties of Nerchinsk, Kyakhta, and Aigun signed during the reigns of Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong; the original texts of the "Supplementary Customs Regulations" signed by the Qing government with Italy, France, and Tsarist Russia during the Guangxu period; reports on Xinjiang issues from the Daoguang period; and all the letters and manuscripts of Li Shen, the Qinghai Affairs Minister during the Guangxu period, concerning the Tibetan issue in Qinghai. In addition, there are also rare "Lost Writings from the Dunhuang Grottoes," "New Account of the Western Regions," a Yuan Dynasty opera manuscript "Mawei Slope," a Ming Dynasty woodblock novel "Generals of the Yang Family," and so on.
