Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, December 14th: A widespread, mass-based grain conservation campaign is vigorously unfolding throughout Hebei Province.

Beginning in November, grain conservation campaigns have been universally launched in all cities and special districts and counties throughout the province. Nine cities, including Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Fengfeng, have convened meetings of relevant personnel from factories, mines, government offices, and schools to deploy grain conservation work. According to the plans formulated by forty-six units directly under the province, a total of 141,224 jin of grain can be saved from December this year to the end of June next year. Baoding municipal-level government offices, enterprises, and hospitals have also universally convened meetings of employees and cadres to formulate grain conservation plans. In Tongzhou City, by the end of November, twenty-six units in the city had voluntarily reduced grain rations by more than 5,000 jin. Units in cities such as Qinhuangdao and Shijiazhuang have also actively handed over surplus grain and grain coupons to the state.

Many special districts and counties have also dispatched cadres to go deep into villages and agricultural cooperatives to inspect grain waste. The Xingtai Special District has twice sent cadres to villages and cooperatives to help agricultural cooperatives plug loopholes in grain waste, publicize the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, verify the numbers for requisition, purchase, and sale, and organize the adjustment of surpluses and deficits within the cooperatives. In Ningjin County, many cooperatives that originally reported inaccurate yields voluntarily reported actual yields. Some agricultural cooperatives in disaster areas have also included grain obtained from salvaged autumn leftovers, which had not been calculated in the past, into the existing grain count, allowing the state to supply a large batch of grain less. In areas with bumper grain harvests, many agricultural cooperatives are actively selling surplus grain and above-quota grain to the state to support disaster areas. By the end of November, 305 million jin of grain had been put into storage. The Xiliucun Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative in Zunhua County, in addition to fulfilling the state's grain purchase tasks in accordance with policy, also sold 41% of the above-quota portion of its grain "three fix" (三定) , totaling more than 73,000 jin, to the state. The "Cunrui" Agricultural Cooperative in Huailai County, Zhangjiakou Special District, has already sold 300,000 jin of above-quota grain to the state. Recently, after careful calculation by all members, they sold another 80,000 jin of above-quota grain to the state.

    河北普遍展开节约粮食运动
    新华社保定14日电　一个广泛的群众性的节约粮食运动，正在河北省各地蓬勃展开。
    从11月份开始，全省各城镇和专区、县都已经普遍开展了节约粮食的运动。保定、石家庄、峰峰等九个城市都召开了厂矿、机关、学校有关人员会议，布置节约粮食的工作。根据省直四十六个单位订出的计划，从今年12月份起到明年6月底，一共可以节约十四万一千二百二十四斤粮食。保定市级各机关、企业和医院也普遍召开了职工干部会议，订出了节约粮食的计划。通州市在11月底，全市已有二十六个单位自动减少粮食定量五千多斤。秦皇岛、石家庄等市各单位还纷纷向国家缴回多余粮食和粮票。
    很多专区、县还抽派干部深入到乡和农业社检查粮食浪费情况。邢台专区曾两次派干部到乡、社帮助农业社堵塞浪费粮食的漏洞，宣传粮食统购统销政策，核算征、购、销数字，组织社内余缺调剂。宁晋县有不少原报产量不确实的社，自动报出了实际产量。有些灾区农业社把过去没有计算在内的打捞残秋所得的粮食也算在现有粮食数内，使国家少供应一大批粮食。在粮食丰收地区，很多农业社积极向国家缴售余粮和超产量支援灾区，到11月下旬止，入库粮食已有三亿零五百万斤。遵化县西留村爱国农业社除按政策规定完成国家粮食征购任务外，还把粮食“三定”超产部分41％共七万三千多斤卖给了国家。张家口专区怀来县“存瑞”农业社已经卖过三十万斤超产粮给国家，最近全体社员经过细算，又卖出八万斤超产粮给国家。
