Xinhua News Agency, December 7th, Cairo dispatch: The UN Emergency Force office in Cairo issued a communique stating that the UN Emergency Force Commander, General Burns, went to Port Said on the 5th to meet with the British-French Allied Forces Commander, General Keightley, and others to finalize the details of the withdrawal of British and French troops from the Suez Canal area and the gradual assumption of responsibility by the UN Emergency Force.

The communique stated that Keightley informed Burns that the British-French withdrawal "depends to a large extent on the availability of ships to transport troops, vehicles, and equipment."

At the same time, Burns said that it is expected that the British and French forces will complete their withdrawal from Egypt within two or three weeks.

A spokesman for the UN Emergency Force in Cairo said that once the British and French troops withdraw from Egypt, the UN Emergency Force will leave Port Said and be stationed along the demarcation line between Egypt and Israel as determined by the 1949 armistice agreement.

The spokesman said that the UN Emergency Force currently has two thousand personnel.

　　英法军将在两三周内撤出埃及
    新华社7日讯　开罗消息：联合国紧急部队开罗办事处发表公报说，联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯将军5日前往塞得港，同英法联军总司令凯特莱等订出了英法军队从苏伊士运河区撤退以及联合国紧急部队逐步担负责任的细节。
    公报说，凯特莱通知伯恩斯说，英法撤军“在很大程度上决定于能够得到运输军队、车辆和装备的船只的情况”。
    同时，伯恩斯说，预料英法部队将在两周或三周内从埃及撤退完毕。
    在开罗的一位联合国紧急部队的发言人说，一俟英法军队撤出埃及，联合国紧急部队就离开塞得港而沿1949年停战协定所确定的埃及和以色列的分界线驻扎。
    发言人说，联合国紧急部队现在已经有两千人。
