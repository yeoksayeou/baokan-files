Why Can't Arts and Crafts Be Designed to Be More Attractive?
    Xīn Cháo
The disconnect between the production and sales of arts and crafts and the art design work has not seen any practical action since the publication of "Opinions of Artists on Exported Arts and Crafts" in the twelfth issue of "New Observer" on June 16th, except for some related articles and a symposium held by the Export Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Trade. What is the reason for this? According to my personal understanding, the following uncommunicated thoughts exist in the relevant parties:

The sales department believes: "We are earning foreign exchange for the country and doing business according to the preferences of foreigners, which is not wrong." The production unit feels: "Our products mainly rely on export companies for promotion. If we do not produce according to the standards of export companies, the products will be stockpiled and there is no way out." Arts and crafts artists think: "The current design power is very weak, it's better not to talk about it, talking more will make our responsibility heavier, which we cannot handle." These thoughts of "not wrong," "no way out," and "dare not talk" are certainly not right, and the main key lies in the operating philosophy of the sales department, which thinks it is "not wrong" but is actually highly problematic.

Before liberation, China's arts and crafts industry suffered from the long-term economic and cultural aggression of imperialism and the constant destruction of reactionary rule. It goes without saying that private merchants also took the opportunity to produce crude products, engage in speculation, and cater to the tastes of foreigners in order to make huge profits. They would do whatever the foreigners wanted, gradually disfiguring the excellent traditions of arts and crafts, to the point of leading to the tragic situation of the loss of skills and the death of artisans. After the founding of New China, national sovereignty was restored, and the people became masters of their own affairs. The painful experience of the past should never be repeated. However, why do we still have the heart to retain the old "business model" in the export business of arts and crafts today, and why are we reluctant to change it thoroughly?

"Earning foreign exchange for the country to help the construction of heavy industry" is indeed "not wrong," but the problem is that in order to earn foreign exchange, we sometimes disregard the country's political reputation and cultural influence abroad. Comrade Linghuxian's "Merchant Philosophy" (see "People's Daily" on September 4th) concluded very incisively: "Don't sell out our thousands of years of cultural influence and today's international reputation along with it!" However, the sales department's old idea of only caring about "selling it out" seems to be quite stubborn and not easy to change. The current development of China's arts and crafts industry urgently awaits them to sincerely change this thinking.

Because the sales department places large orders with production units based on their unchanging sales methods, the production units, in order to have a way out for their products, also follow the fixed standards and specifications of this major customer for mass production. At the same time, because of this, arts and crafts artists cannot intervene in the design of new products and the improvement of old products. Experienced artisans with traditional skills also have no time to try out new varieties in order to complete the production tasks stipulated in the quotas. The existing old varieties are becoming increasingly crude in quality due to the sales department's urgent demand for goods and the overly low wage cost limits. For example, the lacquerware and other arts and crafts in Fujian are therefore forming a phenomenon of only seeking quantity, not quality, and constantly rising prices. This phenomenon is already a common phenomenon in the production of arts and crafts across the country.

As for the low wages of artisans, it is astonishing. For example, tens of thousands of embroidery artisans in Suzhou, Changsha, and other places can usually only earn two or three jiao a day. Other artisans, such as those engaged in drawnwork and net扣, also have extremely low wages. In recent years, after people's representatives and CPPCC members such as Zheng Zhenduo, Xu Guangping, and Tian Han visited various places and reported this situation to the relevant departments, the wages of artisans have been slightly increased, but the vast majority have not been reasonably resolved. How can we develop arts and crafts and how can we keep artisans from changing careers! The reason why the sales department refuses to raise wages is: "Reduce costs and earn more money for the country," but they have never thought that this simple profit-making point of view is the main factor causing the crude production of arts and crafts, the passive change of careers by artisans, the inability to exert the excellent skills of elderly artisans, and the unwillingness of young people to learn arts and crafts.

In fact, even from the sales point of view, if this continues, in the near future, our products will not be able to compete in the international market, and the past and present reputation will disappear. This phenomenon has not occurred without precedent. For example, in 1954, the silk company organized the export of embroidered cushions, but 20,000 pairs were returned due to poor quality and patterns. In June of this year, the "Commodity Quality Exhibition" jointly organized by five units including the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing exhibited this batch of returned embroidery and wrote this fact on the label, but the distribution department still denied it, saying, "There is no such thing," supposedly because "it is inconvenient to discuss publicly." This fully shows that the distribution department has not realized the serious consequences of their operating philosophy, and therefore cannot seriously examine the main shortcomings in the work of their subordinate departments and be determined to correct them. They believe that the failure of arts and crafts is the responsibility of the industrial and commercial management departments, the handicraft management departments, and the cultural departments. The sales department should not be solely responsible. Yes, the above departments all have responsibilities, but the main key lies in sales, especially foreign sales institutions. Because most of the major arts and crafts are currently mass-produced for export, as long as the varieties are processed and ordered by foreign sales agencies, it is difficult to improve them. Just look, the "Representative Kong"-style purchasing personnel sent by the export company to various places are the authoritative figures who determine the fate of those arts and crafts. Apart from them, others often have no way to provide any opinions on improving products.

There are indeed many problems in China's current arts and crafts work, which require the joint cooperation of all relevant parties, including arts and crafts artists, production units, and distribution departments. It is unnecessary for arts and crafts artists to worry about their own weakness and fear trouble, and arts and crafts should also develop vigorously under the call of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." It is also very inappropriate for the production tasks of production units to be completely subordinate to the few representatives sent by the distribution department to various places.

It is hoped that the Fourth Office of the State Council will conduct research in conjunction with the relevant departments as soon as possible and take effective measures to solve the problems of unified leadership and clear division of labor in arts and crafts. Conscientiously examine the deviations and shortcomings in past work, establish good relations between the production, distribution, and design improvement of arts and crafts, and cooperate with each other and work together for the same cause.

### 为什么工艺美术品不能设计得更好看些？

    为什么工艺美术品不能设计得更好看些？
    新潮
    工艺美术品的产销业务同美术设计工作的脱节问题，自从6月16日第十二期“新观察”发表了“美术家对出国工艺品的意见”以后，除了陆续看到过一些有关的文章以及对外贸易部出口局曾召开了一次座谈会以外，就不见其他的实际行动了。这是什么原因呢？根据个人的了解，各有关方面存在着这样一些未能互相沟通的思想：
    销售部门认为：“我们为国家争取外汇，按照外国人的喜好作买卖，没有错。”生产单位觉得：“我们的产品主要依靠出口公司推销，如不按照出口公司的标准生产，产品积压下来，没办法。”工艺美术家想想：“目前设计力量很薄弱，不谈还好，多谈谈，自己的责任更重，应付不了。”这些认为“没有错”的、“没办法”的、以及“不敢谈”的思想，当然都是不对头的，而主要关键更在于销售部门自以为“没有错”而实在大有问题的经营思想。
    解放以前我国工艺美术事业，因外受帝国主义长期的经济、文化侵略，内受反动统治不断的摧残，是不用说了，一般私商也趁此粗制滥造、投机取巧，一味迎合外国人的癖好，以图厚利，只要外国人要什么，就给办什么，逐渐使工艺美术的优良传统，面目全非，以至沦于人亡技绝的悲惨境地。新中国成立以后，国家主权恢复，人民当家作主，过去那段沉痛的经历，应该是一去不复返了。可是，今天工艺美术品的外销业务上，为什么还忍心保留着过去的那种“经营方式”，而迟迟不愿彻底改变呢？
    “为国家争取外汇，帮助重工业建设”，确是“没有错”，问题在于：为了争取外汇，有时竟不顾国家对外的政治声誉和文化影响。令狐弦同志的“商人哲学”（见9月4日“人民日报”）一文结尾一句话说得很透彻：“不要连带把我们几千年来的文化影响和今天的国际声誉也一起‘销出去’！”然而销售部门的这种只顾“销出去”的旧思想，看来是相当固执，不大容易改除的。当前我国工艺美术事业要得到发展，十分迫切地期待着他们诚心诚意改除这种思想。
    因为销售部门既然根据他们一成不变的经销方式去向生产单位大批定货，生产单位为了产品有出路，也就服从这位大主顾的固定标准规格来进行大量生产。同时，因为这样，工艺美术家也就无法插手进行新产品的设计和旧产品的改良，富有传统经验的艺人，为了完成定额规定的生产任务，也无暇试制新品种。现有的老品种，由于销售部门要货要得急和工资成本限额过低，质量也越来越粗糙。例如目前福建的漆器和其他各种工艺美术品便因此形成只求数量、不求质量、价格不断上升的现象。这种现象，已经是全国各地工艺美术品生产上的普遍现象了。
    至于艺人们工资的低微，使人惊讶。比如苏州、长沙等地的好几万刺绣艺人，通常每人每天只能拿到二、三角钱。其他如挑花、网扣等艺人，工资也极低。近年来，郑振铎、许广平、田汉等各位人民代表和政协委员，到各地视察回来向各有关部门反映了这一情况后，艺人工资虽然略有提高，但极大多数仍未合理的解决。这怎能发展工艺美术、怎能叫艺人不改行转业呢！销售部门不肯提高工资的理由是：“减低成本，为国家多赚钱”，可是他们从来没有想到这种单纯的营利观点，正是造成工艺美术品粗制滥造、艺人们纷纷消极改业、老年艺人的优秀技术无从发挥、青年人不愿学习工艺美术等等的主要因素。
    其实，即使单从销售方面来说，如长此以往，不久的将来，我们的产品也将无法在国际市场上进行竞争，过去和目前的声誉，也将会消失下去。这种现象不是没有出现过，例如1954年，丝绸公司组织外销的刺绣靠垫，因质量和图案太差，退回两万对。今年6月间，轻工业部、商业部等五个单位在北京联合举办的“商品质量展览会”上就曾展出了这批退回的刺绣品，并在标签上写着这一事实，可是经销部门还要否认说，“并无其事”，据说是因为“不便公开谈论”。这充分说明经销部门还没有认识到他们那种经营思想所造成的严重后果，因此便不可能认真检查他们所属各部门工作中的主要缺点，下决心纠正。他们认为工艺美术事业搞不好，工商业管理部门、手工业管理部门和文化部门都有责任。不应该单叫销售部门负责。是的，上述各部门都有责任，但主要关键还在于销售、特别是外销机构。因为目前各种主要工艺美术品都为外销而大量地赶工生产，只要是由外销机构加工定货的品种，就很难进行改良。试看，出口公司派驻各地的“孔代表”式的进货人员，都是决定那些工艺美术品命运的权威人物，除了他们以外，别人往往没法提供什么改良产品之类的意见。
    目前我国工艺美术工作中存在的问题确实很多，需要工艺美术家、生产单位和经销部门等有关各方面共同一致地协作。工艺美术家们因为自身力量的薄弱而顾虑重重，怕麻烦，是不必要的，工艺美术也应该在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的号召下蓬勃地发展。生产单位的生产任务完全服从于经销部门派驻各地的少数代表，也是非常不妥的。
    希望国务院第四办公厅会同各有关部门迅速进行研究，采取有效措施，解决工艺美术统一领导、明确分工的问题。认真地检查过去工作中的偏差和缺点，建立工艺美术生产、经销和设计改良工作之间的良好关系，为着同一事业而相互配合、共同努力。
