Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhu Bin and Zhu Jigong report: 1956 has been a year in which capital scientists have made great strides towards new science and technology. More than ten institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing have already carried out numerous research projects in advanced world science and technology.

    Scientists at the Institute of Applied Physics have designed and manufactured equipment for making semiconductor transistors and have used foreign materials to produce some semiconductor diodes and triodes. Scientists at the Institute of Geophysics have completed many preparatory tasks for weather forecasting using electronic computers. In one or two years, China's weather forecasts will be able to rely on the latest technical equipment. Preparatory organizations for the Institutes of Radio Electronics, Computer Technology, and Automated Remote Control were also established in the second half of this year, and many professors and experts enthusiastically participated in the preparatory work.

    This year, scientists have also conducted research work based on China's characteristics and the urgent needs of economic construction.

    Scientists at the Institute of Geology have investigated and studied the geological structure, strata, rocks, and their development history in the Qaidam Basin, the Qilian Mountains, the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and have discovered many underground treasures in some areas. The geological maps of these areas completed this year have become important reference materials for exploration workers.

    Geophysical scientists and historical researchers have compiled earthquake records from local chronicles and gazetteers across China from 1189 BC to 1955. This year, they also traveled south to Guangzhou, passing through Yunnan, Sichuan, and Gansu, covering more than 30,000 kilometers, and finally returned to Beijing from Baotou. They investigated the geological structures and earthquake remains in these areas and completed the work of dividing China into earthquake zones, providing valuable data for national construction departments. Geophysical scientists have also completed the China Climate Regionalization Map, the theoretical calculation of the annual inflow of seventeen major rivers, and groundwater resources in various regions.

    The research results of the scientists at the Institute of Chemistry on the manufacture of organic glass have become the basis for industrial departments to build factories. This year, these scientists have further studied the problem of improving the quality of organic glass and have used a material similar to organic glass to make special lubricating oil that does not freeze in the coldest conditions and does not melt at temperatures of over 3000 degrees. Research on the use of carbolic acid and materials obtained from natural gas to make synthetic fibers with nylon-like properties has made considerable progress in the Institute of Chemistry.

    China is a country with many salt lakes. In areas such as Xinjiang, there is a salt lake almost every hundred kilometers. How can the salt in these salt lakes be used as chemical raw materials in addition to providing food for the people? This year, scientists at the Institute of Chemistry, in cooperation with the Salt Bureau, investigated the conditions of the Chaka Salt Lake in Qinghai; preliminary confirmation is that the Chaka Salt Lake is a source of chloride sulfate, sodium, magnesium, and other substances.

    Scientists have also studied the movement patterns of Yellow River sediment, the plastic deformation of metallic materials at high temperatures, discovered new laws of atomic arrangement in aluminum, copper, and nickel alloys, and summarized the techniques for refining metals such as antimony, aluminum, and tin to the highest purity.

    向新的科学技术大踏步前进
    首都科学工作者今年开展了多项研究工作
    新华社30日讯　新华社记者朱彬、朱继功报道：1956年是首都科学工作者向新的科学技术大踏步迈进的一年，中国科学院在北京的十多个研究所已经在世界先进科学技术方面开展了多项研究工作。
    应用物理研究所的科学工作者自己设计了制造半导体晶体管的设备，并用国外材料制出了一些半导体二极管和三极管。地球物理研究所的科学工作者完成了用电子计算机预报天气的许多准备工作，一两年后中国的天气预报就可以依靠最新的技术设备进行了。无线电电子学、计算技术、自动化远距离控制等研究所的筹备机构也在今年下半年成立，许多教授和专家热情地参加了筹建工作。
    科学工作者在今年还根据中国特点和经济建设的迫切需要开展了研究工作。
    地质研究所的科学工作者在柴达木盆地、祁连山区、小兴安岭、内蒙古自治区西部等地，调查研究了地质构造地层、岩石、和它们的发展历史，并且在有些地区发现了不少地下宝藏。他们今年完成的这些地区的地质图已成为勘探工作者的重要参考资料。
    地球物理科学工作者和历史学的研究工作者整理了中国各地从公元前1189年到1955年的县志、州志里所记载的地震情况；今年又南下广州经云南、四川、甘肃走了三万多公里的路程，最后由包头回到北京，他们调查了这些地区的地质构造和地震的遗迹，完成了中国地震区域划分的工作，为国家建设部门提供了可贵的资料。地球物理科学工作者还完成了中国气候区域划分图、十七条大河全年进流量和各地区地下水资源的理论计算工作。
    化学研究所的科学工作者所完成的关于制造有机玻璃的研究成果，已经成为工业部门建设工厂的依据，今年这些科学工作者又进一步就提高有机玻璃品质的问题进行了研究，并且用类似有机玻璃的一种材料做成了特殊的润滑油，这种润滑油在最冷的情况下不冻，在三千多度的高温下也不熔化。利用石炭酸和从天然煤气中获得的东西来做类似尼龙那样性质的合成纤维的研究工作，在化学研究所里已取得了不少成绩。
    中国是个多盐湖的国家，在新疆等地区几乎每隔一百公里就有一个盐湖。怎样使这些盐湖里的盐除了供人民食用外，还可以做化学原料呢。化学研究所的科学工作者今年配合盐务局调查了青海茶卡盐池的情况；初步肯定茶卡盐池是氯化物硫酸盐、钠、镁等物的产地。
    科学工作者还研究了黄河泥沙的运动规律、金属材料在高温下的塑性变化，还发现了铝、铜、镍合金的原子排列新规律，总结出了锑、铝、锡等金属提炼到最纯度的技术。
