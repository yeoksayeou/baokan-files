　  Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai. Artificially cultivated mushrooms in the suburbs of Shanghai have begun to be harvested, with three to four hundred catties of plump, fresh mushrooms being picked daily. Artificially cultivated mushrooms have thicker flesh and a fresher taste than wild mushrooms.
    Originally, there were more than a dozen individually operated mushroom production units in the suburbs of Shanghai. This spring, they merged into three mushroom production cooperatives. Due to improved management, the mushrooms are growing particularly well this year, and it is expected that production will increase by 30 to 40 percent compared to last year.

　  人工培植的蘑菇
    据新华社上海电　上海市郊人工培植的蘑菇开始采摘，每天都摘下三、四百斤肥厚的鲜蘑菇。人工培植的蘑菇比野生蘑菇肉质厚，味道也更鲜美。
    上海市郊原来有十多个个体经营蘑菇的生产单位，今年春季他们合并为三个蘑菇生产合作社。由于改善了经营管理，今年蘑菇长得特别好，预计比去年能增产三、四成。
