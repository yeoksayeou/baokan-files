Mangshi

Mangshi is the capital of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, bordering our friendly neighbor Myanmar, and only tens of kilometers away from the China-Myanmar border. Mangshi is surrounded by mountains, with a subtropical climate. Now that northern China is covered in ice and snow, here it is still warm as spring, with flowers in full bloom. The residents here are Dai and Han Chinese. In 1952, there were only 799 households, but now there are more than a thousand. In ancient times, this was one of the roads connecting China to Myanmar, and the economic and cultural ties with Myanmar were very close. However, due to the rule of the reactionaries, this connection was constantly hindered. During the Anti-Japanese War, the invading Japanese army invaded from Myanmar, and Mangshi suffered great damage, almost becoming a ruin.

After liberation, Mangshi was reborn. In the past year alone, the state invested more than 780,000 yuan in basic construction, with a construction area of ​​approximately 14,700 square meters. The office building of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, the Dehong Working Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Ethnic Hospital, Xinhua Bookstore, and the Trade Company have all been established successively. The office building of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee has three floors and is the tallest building in the city. The city also has Luxi National Middle School, which was established in 1952 and is the earliest secondary school in the entire autonomous prefecture. Initially, only six people came here to study, but this spring the number has reached fifty. In the northeast of the city, there is also an ethnic hospital - Luxi Ethnic Hospital. In addition to the outpatient department, the hospital also has an inpatient department with a capacity of 50 beds. The hospital is relatively well-equipped, with universal operating beds, sun lamps, microscopes and other instruments and equipment, and general cesarean sections can be performed. The nurses in the hospital include Dai and Jingpo people. They can handle the nursing work in internal medicine, surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. Some have been able to serve as assistants in major surgeries. In the southwest of Mangshi, there are Xinhua Factory and Dehong Tropical Crop Experimental Farm. Xinhua Factory produces sugar, wine and vermicelli. In the Dehong Tropical Crop Experimental Farm, various subtropical plants are cultivated. The farm has vast forest land and various crop nurseries.

The residents here have a habit of going to the market. The market is held every five days, commonly known as "Street Day." Usually, around 3,000 people attend the market. After the harvest, the number can reach 7,000. People from the Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, and Han ethnic groups come here to attend the market. The Jingpo and other ethnic groups from the mountains bring tea and firewood needed by the Dai people, while the Dai and Han people supply them with the daily necessities they need. Here, people can buy Shanghai calico, Tianjin towels, Guangzhou rubber shoes, Chongqing toothpaste, soap, and more than 2,000 other commodities.

Thousands of border people from China and Myanmar will soon hold a joint celebration here. It can be believed that through this extensive celebration, the traditional friendship between the border people of China and Myanmar will be further developed, and Mangshi will leave a glorious page in the history of friendship between China and Myanmar!

    芒市
    芒市，是云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州的首府，和我们的友邦缅甸毗邻，距中缅两国国界只有几十公里路程。芒市四面环山，气候是亚热带，现在，在祖国的北方已是千里冰封，而这里还温暖如春，鲜花盛开。这里的居民是傣族和汉族，1952年还只有七百九十九户，现在已在千户以上了。远在古代，这里就是我国通往缅甸的道路之一，不论在经济和文化方面，和缅甸联系都很密切。但由于反动派的统治，这种联系不断受到阻挠。在抗日战争时期，日本侵略军队由缅甸侵入，芒市曾受到极大的破坏，几乎成为废墟。
    解放后，芒市新生了。仅去年一年，国家投入基本建设方面的资金就达七十八万多元，建筑面积约有一万四千七百多平方公尺。自治州人民委员会的办公大楼、中共德宏工作委员会、民族医院、新华书店、贸易公司……都相继建立。自治州人民委员会的办公大楼，共三层，是市内最高大的一个建筑物。市内还有潞西民族中学，开办于1952年，是整个自治州成立最早的一所中等学校。最初，来这里读书的只有六个人，今年春季已达五十人。市的东北部，还有一所民族医院——潞西民族医院。院内除设有门诊部外，还有一个住院部，能容五十张病床。医院的设备比较完善，有万能手术床、太阳灯、显微镜等仪器设备，一般的剖腹手术都可以做。医院里的护理员，有傣族的，也有景颇族的，内科、外科、妇产科的护理工作，她们都能担任，有的已能担任大手术的助手。芒市的西南部，有新华工厂和德宏热带作物试验场。新华工厂生产糖、酒和粉丝。在德宏热带作物试验场内，培植着多种亚热带的植物，场内有广阔的林地和各种作物的苗圃。
    这里的居民，都有赶街的习惯。街期五天一次，俗称“街子天”。赶街的人，平时在三千左右。丰收以后，人数可达七千。来这里赶街的，有傣族、景颇族，也有傈僳族和汉族的人民。从山上来的景颇等族的人民，背来了傣族需要的茶和烧柴，傣族和汉族则供应他们需要的日用品。在这里，人们能够买到上海的花布，天津的毛巾，广州的胶鞋，重庆的牙膏、肥皂等两千多种商品。
    中缅两国成千的边境人民，最近将在这里举行联欢大会。可以相信，通过这一广泛的联欢活动，中缅两国边境人民的传统友谊必将进一步发展，芒市，也要在中缅两国友谊史上留下它光辉的一页！（附图片）
    芒市是云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州的首府，又是连贯中缅两国的“滇缅公路”的必经地。市内风景极为幽美。这是芒市著名的佛塔——“风平金宝塔”，具有傣族人民传统的建筑艺术特色。　新华社记者　王传国摄
