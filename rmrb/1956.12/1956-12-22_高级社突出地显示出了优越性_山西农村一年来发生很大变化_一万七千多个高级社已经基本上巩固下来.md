Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 21st – The more than 17,000 advanced agricultural production cooperatives established in Shanxi Province this year have been basically consolidated. According to the preliminary summary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, these advanced cooperatives have shown many advantages this year, the most prominent of which are: the enthusiasm of farmers for labor has generally increased, the potential of production materials has been brought into play, agricultural production technology has improved, diversified economic activities have developed, the ability to overcome natural disasters has been strengthened, women have been completely liberated, the lives of the old, weak, and poor farmers have been taken care of, landlords and rich peasants have been subjected to labor reform, farmers' cultural life has improved, and social customs have changed.

In the early spring of this year, when these advanced cooperatives were first established, 80% to 90% of the cooperatives successively implemented labor quota management and piece-rate payment systems, gradually establishing labor order within the cooperatives. As a result, the enthusiasm of the vast majority of cooperative members for labor generally increased, and labor efficiency generally increased by 20% to 40% compared to last year. Subsequently, these cooperatives vigorously carried out agricultural capital construction, universally developed diversified economic activities, and extensively improved production technology, and fully utilized the potential of production materials such as land, farm tools, and livestock, providing favorable conditions for increasing production. Because of the concentration of financial and human resources in advanced agricultural cooperatives, they effectively overcame four types of disasters this year. In the Jinan area, farmers used more than 8 million catties of pesticides in the fight against cotton aphids, an increase of five times compared to last year, finally preventing the harm of cotton aphids and stabilizing cotton production. The most difficult to deal with strong winds and frosts in the past were also overcome by agricultural cooperatives this year. When news of frost warnings came out, farmers in Fenyang County immediately lit firewood to prevent frost, and villages were lit with fires and the ground was smoking. This kind of comprehensive and large-scale disaster prevention was impossible in the past.

Many new changes have taken place in the countryside after the universal increase in production. In the early winter of this year, most of the poor, old, and weak farmers in the province, except for the cooperatives that suffered disasters, had enough food. Some cooperatives in the Changzhi area, which had a better foundation, generally implemented the "Five Guarantees." More than half of the female cooperative members in the rural population participated in field production after the cooperatives held busy season nurseries, mutual aid groups, and nurseries. After the autumn harvest, they received labor remuneration according to the amount they were entitled to. In this way, many families that were previously unharmonious between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law have now been transformed into united and harmonious families. More than 6% of the landlords and rich peasants in the province also actively and peacefully engaged in production under the supervision of agricultural cooperatives, and their incomes have increased. At present, more than 80% of the landlords and rich peasants in the province have been transformed through labor, changed their social composition, and obtained the title of formal cooperative members. Over the past year, new social customs have increasingly manifested themselves in people's thoughts and actions, and various disputes among farmers have been greatly reduced. In the Jinan area, civil cases from January to September decreased by 68% compared with the same period last year, and theft decreased by one-half. Many of the original loafers and lazy people have also been transformed into honest laboring farmers under the supervision and education of agricultural cooperatives.

The number of farm households participating in advanced and elementary cooperatives in Shanxi Province accounts for more than 99% of the total number of farm households in the province. These cooperatives have achieved great victories in resisting disasters and striving for increased production this year. According to recent statistics, the unit area yield of grain in the province increased by 15% compared with last year, the total output of cotton increased by more than 17% compared with last year, and the output of oil crops basically maintained the level of last year. With the addition of animal husbandry, forestry, and sideline production, the total value of income increased by 13% compared with last year. On the basis of universal increase in production, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have distributed the annual income in accordance with the principle of "less deduction and more distribution." More than 73% of the cooperative members in the province had higher incomes than last year, and the income of the remaining cooperative members was equal to or slightly lower than last year.

    高级社突出地显示出了优越性
    山西农村一年来发生很大变化
    一万七千多个高级社已经基本上巩固下来
    新华社太原21日电　山西省今年办的一万七千多个高级农业生产合作社已经基本上巩固下来。据中共山西省委初步总结，这些高级社在今年显示了很多优越性，最突出的是：农民劳动积极性普遍提高、生产资料的潜在力得到了发挥、农业生产技术提高了、发展了多种经济、战胜自然灾害的能力加强、妇女彻底解放、老弱贫困农民生活有了照顾、地主富农分子得到劳动改造、农民文化生活改善、社会风尚改观。
    今年春季，这些高级社建成初期，有80％—90％的社先后实行了劳动定额管理和按件计酬的制度，在社内逐步建立了劳动秩序，这样，广大社员劳动积极性普遍提高，劳动效率一般比去年提高20％—40％。随后，这些社又大力进行农业基本建设、普遍发展多种经济、广泛提高生产技术，并且充分发挥了土地、农具和牲畜等生产资料的潜力，为增产提供了有利条件，由于高级形式农业社财力、人力集中，今年曾经连续有效地战胜了四种灾害。晋南专区农民在和棉蚜作斗争中，光使用的药剂就达八百多万斤，比去年增加五倍，终于阻止了棉蚜的危害，稳定了棉花产量。往年最难对付的大风和霜冻，今年也被农业社战胜了。当霜冻预告的消息传出以后，汾阳全县农民立即点燃柴草防治，霎时村村点火，地地冒烟，这种全面的大规模地防灾是过去根本不可能的。
    普遍增产后的农村，出现了很多新的变化。今年初冬，全省除了遭受灾害的社以外，大部分贫困老弱农民都有了足够的口粮，基础较好的长治专区有些社普遍实行了“五保”。占农村人口半数以上的女社员，今年经过社里举办农忙托儿所、互助组和幼儿班以后，有80％的女劳动力参加了田间生产，秋收后，她们按着应得的数目领到劳动报酬。这样，过去婆媳夫妻之间不融洽的家庭，现在好多都转变为团结和睦的家庭了。占全省农户6％多的地主富农分子，也在农业社的监督下，大部分积极安心生产，收入有了增加。现在，全省地主富农分子80％以上在劳动中得到改造，改变了社会成分，取得了正式社员的称号。一年来，新的社会风气越来越多地在人们思想和行动上显示出来，农民之间的各种纠纷大大减少了。晋南专区1月到9月内民事案件比去年同期减少68％，偷盗现象减少二分之一，许多原来的二流子懒汉也在农业社督促教育下，转变为正直的劳动农民。
    山西省参加高级社和初级社的农户占到全省总农户的99％以上。这些社在今年抵抗灾害争取增产上获得巨大胜利。据最近统计，全省粮食单位面积产量比去年提高15％，棉花总产量比去年提高17％多，油料基本上保持去年产量水平，加上畜牧、林业和副业生产，收入总值比去年提高13％。在普遍增产的基础上，全省农业社按照“少扣多分”的原则，已经把全年收益作了分配。全省社员中有73％以上的收入超过去年，其余社员收入和去年相等或稍底于去年。
