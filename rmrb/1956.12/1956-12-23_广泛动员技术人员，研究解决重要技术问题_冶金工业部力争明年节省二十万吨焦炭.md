Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, relying on the collective wisdom of technical personnel, has formulated a plan to use substitutes to make up for the 100,000 tons of coke that will be lacking next year, and is striving to save another 100,000 tons of coke, providing raw materials for increased pig iron production next year.

This problem was collectively studied and solved by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently by convening technical personnel from coke production and user units, as well as scientific research institutions. The main solution is to use substitutes as much as possible in coke used for non-iron smelting purposes. In the past, all cupola furnaces in steel plants and iron melting workshops used coke. However, according to tests by Tangshan Steel Plant and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, at least 10% of anthracite coal can be mixed in. If the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry promotes this experience, it can save more than 20,000 tons of coke next year. In addition, when calcining metallurgical limestone, mixing 50% anthracite coal with coke can also save more than 34,000 tons of coke throughout the year. Copper smelting furnaces, lead smelting furnaces, and gas generators can also be mixed with some natural coke from coal mines or semi-coke, a by-product of oil refining, to replace tens of thousands of tons of coke.

Related enterprises in Anshan, Tangshan, Beijing, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Tianjin, and other places under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have conducted the above-mentioned tests in the second half of this year due to the shortage of coke. In mid-December, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened relevant technical personnel to exchange experience in testing and studied the results of the tests from a technical and theoretical point of view. Various analyses and conclusions of the technical personnel proved that the determined ratio of substitutes to coke is not only economically reasonable, but also guarantees the quality and output of products. According to the test results of related enterprises and some foreign materials, more substitutes can be used to replace coke in non-iron smelting production. Some gas generators in the Soviet Union use coal instead of coke entirely. After testing, some enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry can also use coal entirely in their gas generators. Tianjin Steel Plant and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have also achieved initial results in burning limestone entirely with coal. Some enterprises also use 15% of anthracite coal in cupola furnaces. Now, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is organizing various tests and research work, preparing to strive to save another 100,000 tons of coke.

According to the current plan arranged by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, if the supply of ore and coke is sufficient next year, it can also increase the production of pig iron by about 200,000 tons. Therefore, saving one more ton of coke can increase the production of more than one ton of iron next year. However, the supply of anthracite coal, natural coke, and semi-coke will also be tight next year. Therefore, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry hopes that relevant departments will try to supply as many of these coke substitutes as possible, and work together to increase the production of pig iron, which is urgently needed by the country.

From the start of production to the end of its usable life decades later, the output of a coke oven generally does not increase much. However, the technical personnel have not given up their efforts in this area. The Anshan Chemical Plant adopted the Soviet experience of adding diesel oil to coke ovens to increase coke production during the Patriotic War, and has achieved preliminary results of increasing production by 1.5% after multiple tests. Recently, the technical personnel of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, according to the American experience of adding petroleum residues to coke ovens to increase coke production introduced in foreign magazines, are also continuing research and testing to increase coke production.

One of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry's policies of increasing production and practicing economy is to increase production and practice economy from a technical point of view. The Ministry's above-mentioned solution to the problem of insufficient coke supply next year proves that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy from a technical point of view is huge and reliable.

    广泛动员技术人员，研究解决重要技术问题
    冶金工业部力争明年节省二十万吨焦炭
    据新华社21日讯　冶金工业部依靠技术人员群策群力，拟定出用代用品补足明年所缺少的十万吨焦炭的计划，并且努力争取再节省十万吨焦炭，为明年增产生铁提供原料。
    这个问题是冶金工业部最近召集焦炭生产和使用单位以及科学研究机关的技术人员，集体研究解决的。解决的办法主要是在非炼铁用的焦炭中尽量采用代用品。各炼钢厂和铸造车间化铁水的化铁炉，过去全部用焦炭。但是，据唐山钢厂和石景山钢铁厂试验，至少可以掺用10％的无烟煤。如果冶金工业部推广这一经验，明年就能节省两万多吨焦炭。另外，在焙烧冶金用石灰石的时候，在焦炭中掺用50％的无烟煤，全年也可以节省三万四千多吨焦炭。炼铜炉、炼铅炉和煤气发生炉，也可以掺用一部分煤矿里的天然焦或炼石油的副产品——半焦，来代替几万吨焦炭。
    冶金工业部所属鞍山、唐山、北京、上海、太原、天津等地的有关企业，今年下半年由于焦炭缺乏，曾经作过上述种种试验。12月中旬，冶金工业部召集有关技术人员交流试验的经验，从技术理论上研究了试验的结果。技术人员们的各种分析和结论证明，已经确定的代用品和焦炭的比例，不仅经济上合理，而且可以保证产品的质量和产量。根据有关企业试验结果和国外的一些资料，在非炼铁生产中，还可以用更多的代用品代替焦炭。苏联有些煤气发生炉就全部用煤代替焦炭，冶金工业部有的企业的煤气发生炉，经过试验，也可以全部用煤。天津钢厂和太原钢铁厂全部用煤烧石灰石，也获得了初步成效。还有些企业在化铁炉中用15％的无烟煤。现在冶金工业部正组织进行各种试验和研究工作，准备争取再节省十万吨焦炭。
    按照目前冶金工业部安排的计划，明年如果矿石和焦炭供应充分，还可以增产二十万吨左右的生铁。因此多节省一吨焦炭明年就可以多增产一吨多铁。但是明年无烟煤、天然焦和半焦的供应也不宽裕，因此，冶金工业部希望有关部门设法尽量多供应这些焦炭代用品，共同努力增产国家十分需要的生铁。
    一座焦炉从开炉生产到用几十年以后不能使用为止，产量一般不会有多大增加，但是技术人员们并没有放弃在这方面的努力。鞍钢化工总厂采用苏联卫国战争时期在焦炉内加柴油增产焦炭的经验，经过多次试验，已经取得增产1.5％的初步成果；最近，冶金工业部的技术人员根据外国杂志介绍的美国在焦炉内加石油残渣增产焦炭的经验，也在继续研究试验，以增加焦炭的产量。
    冶金工业部增产节约的方针之一，就是从技术上增产节约。这个部上述解决明年焦炭供应不足的问题，证明从技术上增产节约的潜力是巨大而可靠的。
