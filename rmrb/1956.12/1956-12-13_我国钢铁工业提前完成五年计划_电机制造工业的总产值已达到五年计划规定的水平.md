Xinhua News Agency, December 12th – China's iron and steel industry enterprises have completed the Five-Year Plan one year and one month ahead of schedule.

　　By the end of November this year, the cumulative annual steel production reached 4.15 million tons, pig iron over 4.67 million tons, and steel products 3.23 million tons. Compared with the 1957 level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, steel reached 100.7%, iron reached 100%, and steel products reached 106.1%.

　　The utilization coefficients of open-hearth furnaces and blast furnaces, which mark the technical level of steel production, reached the 1957 targets of the Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule last year. This indicator stipulates that blast furnaces nationwide should produce one ton of iron per 0.896 cubic meters of volume per day and night. The average for the first eleven months of this year was 0.765 cubic meters. The Five-Year Plan stipulates that open-hearth furnace bottoms should produce 5.6 tons of steel per square meter per day and night; the average for the first eleven months of this year was 6.58 tons. In this regard, China's old and new factories are keeping pace, and Shanghai's No. 3 and No. 1 Steel Plants, built during the First and Second World Wars, often lead the country. In September of this year, the open-hearth furnace bottoms of these two plants produced more than eleven tons of steel per square meter every twenty-four hours.

　　This year, it is estimated that China's open-hearth furnaces will produce an average of 0.6 tons more steel per square meter of furnace bottom area every twenty-four hours than last year, which is extraordinary. Experts familiar with foreign steelmaking conditions say that it takes about four years of effort for countries with advanced steel industry technology to increase the average steel production of open-hearth furnaces by one ton per square meter every twenty-four hours. The rapid improvement of steel production technology in China in recent years is the result of workers learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and their creative labor.

　　The rapid improvement of China's steel production technology has played a significant role in completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Of the more than 2.5 million tons of iron produced by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry more than in 1952 this year, 900,000 tons were increased due to the reduction of the blast furnace utilization coefficient, accounting for 35.5% of the total increase. The pig iron increased by the workers through improving production technology is equivalent to the output of two large blast furnaces like those in Anshan for more than a year. Of the 2.13 million tons of open-hearth furnace steel produced this year more than in 1952, 730,000 tons were increased due to the increase in the utilization coefficient of open-hearth furnaces, accounting for 34% of the total increase, equivalent to the total steel output of all open-hearth furnaces, converters, and electric furnaces in Shanghai for nearly two years.

　　This year, China has been able to smelt more than 300 kinds of steel and produce more than 3,700 specifications of steel products. At the beginning of the Five-Year Plan in 1953, China could only produce more than 180 kinds of steel and 500 to 600 specifications of steel products. Among the new steels produced this year are 19 kinds of heat-resistant stainless steel, which are resistant to high heat and corrosion, including some high-grade alloy steels used in the manufacture of jet aircraft and automobiles. Among the various steel products successfully trial-produced this year, there is a low-alloy threaded steel bar with better performance than ordinary threaded steel bars. Ordinary threaded steel bars can save about 25% compared with ordinary round steel, and this low-alloy threaded steel bar can save another 20% to 35% compared with ordinary threaded steel bars. However, the types of steel and specifications of steel products currently produced in China are far from meeting the needs of the country and are far from the level of the Soviet Union. Last year, the Soviet Union could produce more than 700 kinds of steel and more than 13,000 specifications of steel products.

　　The labor productivity indicators stipulated in China's steel industry Five-Year Plan have also been completed very well. The steel workers of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have produced an average of 363 tons more iron and 137 tons more steel per person this year than in 1952. The cost of steel has also been greatly reduced.

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th – Statistics recently compiled by the planning department of the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing show that, as of the end of October, five of the ministry's major products, including hydro-turbines, AC generators, cables, rubber wires, and switchboards, had reached the output targets for the final year of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Most of the other products are expected to reach the highest level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan before the second quarter of next year. As of the end of October, the total output value of the ministry had exceeded the 1957 plan target by 11.8%, and had reached the level stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan as early as the end of August this year.

The rapid commissioning of newly built and renovated enterprises and the exploitation of the production potential of existing enterprises are the main reasons why the total output value and some major products of the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing have been able to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This year, the total output value of the ministry will increase by more than two times compared with 1952, the output of hydro-turbines will increase by nearly thirteen times in terms of capacity compared with 1952, AC generators will increase by nine times, switchboards will increase by 3.8 times, cables will increase by 6.8 times, and AC motors will increase by 75%.

During the first Five-Year Plan period, the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing's ability to manufacture electrical equipment for various sectors of the national economy has also been greatly improved. Before liberation, all generating equipment above 500 kilowatts, medium and large-sized substation equipment, etc., needed domestically were imported from abroad. Now, China has been able to manufacture its own complete sets of hydro-generating equipment below 10,000 kilowatts and complete sets of thermal power generating equipment below 6,000 kilowatts, as well as complete sets of substation equipment of 110,000 volts and 31,500 kilovolt-amperes. Currently, the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing is trial-producing complete sets of hydro-generating equipment of 15,000 kilowatts and complete sets of thermal power generating equipment of 12,000 kilowatts, of which the 12,000-kilowatt turbo-generator has been successfully trial-produced and put into production.

### 我国钢铁工业提前完成五年计划  电机制造工业的总产值已达到五年计划规定的水平

    我国钢铁工业提前完成五年计划
    电机制造工业的总产值已达到五年计划规定的水平
    新华社12日讯　我国钢铁工业企业提前一年零一个月完成了五年计划。
    到今年11月底，累计一年的钢产量已达到415万吨，铁四百六十七万多吨，钢材三百二十三万吨，同五年计划1957年水平相比，钢完成100.7％，铁完成100％，钢材完成106.1％。
    标志钢铁生产技术水平的平炉和高炉的利用系数，已提前两年在去年达到了五年计划1957年指标。这个指标规定，全国高炉每昼夜每0.896立方公尺容积炼一吨铁。今年前十一个月平均是0.765立方公尺。五年计划规定，平炉炉底每平方公尺每昼夜炼5.6吨钢，今年前十一个月平均是6.58吨。在这方面，我国旧厂和新厂是并驾齐驱的，第一次和第二次世界大战期间建设起来的上海第三和第一钢厂，常常在全国领先。今年9月份，这两个厂平炉炉底每平方公尺每二十四小时炼出了十一吨多钢。
    今年我国的平炉预计平均每平方公尺炉底面积每二十四小时比去年多生产零点六吨钢，这是异乎寻常的。熟悉国外炼钢情况的专家说，世界上钢铁工业技术先进的国家，要四年左右的努力，才能使平炉每平方公尺每二十四小时平均多生产一吨钢。我国近年来钢铁生产技术水平的提高，是职工们学习苏联先进经验和创造性的劳动结果。
    我国钢铁生产技术水平的迅速提高，对提前完成五年计划起了重大作用。今年冶金工业部比1952年多生产的二百五十多万吨铁中，有九十万吨是由于高炉利用系数的降低而增产的，占增长总数的35.5％。由于职工们提高生产技术而增产的这些生铁，等于用很多钱新建像鞍山那样大的两座高炉生产一年多的产量。今年比1952年多生产的二百一十三万吨平炉钢中，有七十三万吨是由于平炉利用系数的提高而增产的，占增长总数的34％，等于上海所有平炉、转炉和电炉近两年钢产量的总合。
    今年我国已经能炼三百多种钢，生产三千七百多种规格的钢材。五年计划开始的1953年，我国只能生产一百八十多种钢和五、六百种规格的钢材。今年新生产的钢有十九种耐热不生锈钢，这些钢耐高热，不怕腐蚀，其中有制造喷气式飞机和汽车用的某种高级合金钢。今年试制成功的各种钢材中，有一种比一般螺纹钢筋性能还好的低合金螺纹钢筋，一般螺纹钢筋比普通圆钢，可以节省25％左右，这种低合金螺纹钢筋比一般螺纹钢筋还可以节省20％到35％。但是目前我国生产的钢种和钢材的规格，还远远赶不上国家的需要，同苏联的水平比较也相距很远。苏联去年就可以生产七百多种钢，一万三千多种规格的钢材。
    我国钢铁工业五年计划规定的劳动生产率指标也完成得很好。冶金部的钢铁工人们，今年平均每人比1952年多生产了三百六十三吨铁，一百三十七吨多钢。钢铁的成本也大大降低了。
    新华社12日讯　电机制造工业部计划部门最近统计出来的数字表明：到10月底为止，这个部的主要产品中已经有水轮机、交流发电机、电缆、橡皮线、开关板等五种提前达到了五年计划最后一年的产量指标，其他几种产品大部分预计可以在明年第二季度以前达到五年计划规定的最高水平。这个部的总产值到10月底止已经超过1957年计划指标11.8％，早在今年8月底就达到了第一个五年计划规定的水平。
    新建、改建的企业迅速投入生产和原有企业发挥生产潜力，是电机制造工业部总产值和一些主要产品能够提前完成五年计划的主要原因。今年，这个部的总产值将比1952年增加两倍以上，水轮机产量按容量计算将比1952年增加近十三倍，交流发电机增加九倍，开关板增加三点八倍，电缆增加六点八倍，交流电动机增加75％。
    在第一个五年计划期间，电机制造工业部为国民经济各部门制造电器设备的能力也大大提高了。解放以前，国内需要的五百瓩以上的发电设备、中型和大型的变电设备等等，全部要从国外输入。现在，我国已经能够自己制造一万瓩以下的全套水轮发电设备，六千瓩以下的全套火力发电设备，十一万伏、三万一千五百千伏安的全套变电设备。目前，电机制造工业部正在试制一万五千瓩的全套水轮发电设备和一万二千瓩的全套火力发电设备，其中一万二千瓩的汽轮发电机已经试制成功，并且投入生产。
