Title: When Will the Dispute Below End?

Let the Dispute Below Continue to What Extent?
　　Long Chun
　　When I first arrived at the Jianxi New Industrial District in Luoyang City, I saw a strange sight: on the sidewalk north of Qingdao Road, people were lining up in long queues in the open air to buy grain from a small window of a dormitory; at the corner of the intersection, two small wooden houses sold cigarettes, sweets, and other daily necessities; in the middle of the rows of buildings that had already been built, temporary sheds had not yet been demolished and had become vegetable markets for the residents... Near the newly built rows of neat neighborhoods, there was not a single permanent store to be seen.
　　Upon inquiring, I learned that this phenomenon was caused by the unresolved issue of investment in public service facilities.
　　In its plan for the Jianxi District, the Luoyang City Urban Construction Committee had requested that when factories built employee dormitories, they should construct some small public service buildings—grain stores, general merchandise stores, consumer cooperatives, post offices, savings offices, etc.—on the ground floors of the buildings along the streets. However, the superior leading organs of the First Tractor Factory, Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory, and other enterprises—such as the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the Automotive Industry Bureau—disagreed, because the state had not provided them with such an investment, and building these public service buildings would affect the building area of the residences. The commercial, postal, and banking departments also said that the state had not provided such funds. As a result, no one built these public service buildings, and all the buildings in many neighborhoods, both upstairs and downstairs, were built as dormitories.
　　After the dormitories were built and the employees moved in, public service institutions were always needed to meet their living needs, so they had to use temporary sheds, wooden houses, and dormitories to "make do." This not only made the city appearance unsightly, but more importantly: First, the area was too small, and employees often had to queue in the open air. Second, temporary sheds were easily damaged and often required repair costs. Third, factories had to allocate some houses to public service departments, making factory dormitories even more strained. Fourth, public service departments would have no place to build permanent buildings in the future. Converting dormitories into shops would require tearing down some walls, which would be wasteful and affect the lifespan of the entire building. The Luoyang City Commercial Bureau did its best and absorbed the funds of public-private joint ventures to build a permanent comprehensive shopping mall and a temporary comprehensive shopping mall near several neighborhoods in the Jianxi District, which solved some problems, but could not replace the retail stores attached to the neighborhoods. In fact, how could employees be expected to travel a long distance to buy a few vegetables, a few pounds of grain, or a pack of cigarettes and a few sheets of toilet paper?
　　It seems that small public service facilities attached to each neighborhood with hundreds of employees are indispensable; regardless of which department provides the funds, it is necessary for the state to allocate certain funds.
　　From what I understand, the relevant central departments have long been aware of this issue; some new industrial districts, because they did not take the above-mentioned "making do" measures in time, have employee living conditions that are even more inconvenient than those in Luoyang, and the relevant central departments have also long been aware of this. However, no nationally publicized and effective solution has yet been seen.
　　In Luoyang City, in order to avoid the above-mentioned unreasonable phenomenon from happening again and to ensure that public service facilities and dormitories are built simultaneously, the Municipal Party Committee now insists on building some small public service buildings on the ground floors of the buildings along the streets in the new neighborhoods. It is also stipulated that these buildings should be invested in and built by the factories first, and then the public service departments will rent or buy them for separate handling. However, this regulation is not being implemented smoothly. In the design of the fifth neighborhood that the First Tractor Factory is currently starting to build, there are no public service buildings on the ground floors of the buildings along the streets, only a space in the middle of the neighborhood is left for building a shopping mall. Now, the employee dormitories in the fifth neighborhood have been under construction for two-story buildings and can be basically completed this year; however, the commercial department will not be able to come to build the shopping mall in the vacant space in the middle until next year due to funding constraints. In the design of the fourth neighborhood, there are also no public service buildings on the ground floors of the buildings along the streets. The Luoyang City Urban Construction Committee asked the First Tractor Factory to revise the drawings, but this neighborhood is about to start construction again, and the revised drawings have not yet been seen.
　　It is indeed not without difficulties to ask the factory to take out this sum of money to build these public service facilities now. On November 21, when I visited the basic construction planning office of the First Tractor Factory, a comrade who had recently returned from Beijing said that they had just attended the joint review of the factory construction budget at the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, and the relevant responsible comrade in the ministry decided that "because it conflicts with national regulations, the investment in public service buildings shall not be included in the factory construction budget." So, how can this specific problem be solved? The comrades in the factory wrote a report and are still waiting for the ministry to approve it.
　　It seems that only the State Economic Commission, the State Construction Commission, and other relevant central departments can take effective measures immediately, unify the thinking of all parties, and propose universally applicable methods to solve this problem. Regardless of which department decides to provide the funds, whether to implement "six unifications"—unified investment, unified construction, unified distribution...—or even to propose a unified temporary solution, and regardless of whether to decide to build small public service facilities on the ground floors of the buildings along the streets, or to decide to build comprehensive shopping malls in appropriate places in the neighborhoods, in any case, we should try to ensure that the public service facilities in the neighborhoods can be built at the same time as the employee residences. Otherwise, the dispute will continue, and unreasonable phenomena will continue to be created. This is neither a long-term solution nor a "stopgap measure."

    让下面争执到几时
  　龙春
    初到洛阳市涧西新工业区，就看到一种奇怪的景象：在青岛路北口人行道上，人们露天排着长长的队伍，在一个宿舍的小窗口前购买粮食；在路口拐角处，两个用木头搭成的小房子，出售纸烟、糖果等日用物品；在已经盖好的一排排楼房中间，临时工棚还没有拆掉，成了居民们的菜市场……。附近新建的好几座整齐的街坊内，竟看不到一所永久性的商店。
    一打听，原来这是公共服务设施投资问题没有解决所造成的现象。
    洛阳市城市建设委员会在涧西区的规划中，曾经要求各厂修建职工宿舍的时候，在沿街楼房的底层修建一部分小型公共服务建筑——粮店、日用百货店、消费合作社、邮局、储蓄所等。但是，第一拖拉机制造厂、洛阳矿山机械厂等企业的上级领导机关——第一机械工业部和汽车工业管理局等——不同意，因为国家没有给他们这样一笔投资，修建了这些公共服务建筑，就影响住宅的建筑面积。商业、邮电、银行等部门呢，也说国家没有给这样一笔钱。于是，这些公共服务建筑就没有人修建了，许多街坊所有楼房楼上楼下都盖成了宿舍。
    等到宿舍盖好，职工住进来以后，总是需要公共服务机构来满足生活需要的，于是便只好拿临时工棚、木板房、宿舍来“凑合”。这一来，市容难看且不说，严重的是：一、面积太小，职工们常常要露天排队。二、临时工棚容易坏，经常要出修理费。三、工厂不得不调给公共服务部门一些房子，使得工厂宿舍更加紧张。四、公共服务部门将来要盖永久性建筑，已经没有地方。拿宿舍改建商店，要拆掉一些墙壁，既浪费又影响整个楼房的寿命。洛阳市商业局尽自己的力量并且吸收公私合营商店的资金，在涧西区几个街坊附近修建了一个永久性的综合商场和一个临时性的综合商场，解决了些问题，但是终究不能代替附设在街坊内的零售商店。事实上，也怎么能够让职工们为了买几棵青菜、几斤粮食或者一盒烟、几张草纸而去跑很远的路呢？
    看来，每个拥有几百户职工的街坊，附设在街坊内的小型公共服务设施是不可少的；不管由哪个部门出钱，国家拨出一定的资金是需要的。
    据我了解，这个问题，中央有关部门早已知道；有的新工业区因为没有及时采取上述的“凑合”办法，职工生活比洛阳更不方便，中央有关部门也早已知道。可是，至今还没有看到提出晓喻全国的、切实有效的解决办法。
    在洛阳市，为了避免再发生上述不合理的现象，保证公共服务设施和宿舍同时建设起来，市委现在坚持要在新建街坊的沿街楼房底层修建一些小型公共服务建筑。并且规定：这些建筑先由工厂投资修建，将来公共服务部门或租或买，另行处理。可是，这个规定执行得并不顺利。第一拖拉机制造厂现在新动工修建的第五号街坊，设计中沿街楼房底层没有公共服务建筑，只在街坊中间空出了一块修建商场的地方。现在，五号街坊的职工宿舍已经施工到二层楼房，今年可以基本盖完；可是，中间空出的地方，商业部门因为资金的限制明年才能来修建商场。第四号街坊的设计中，沿街楼房底层也没有公共服务建筑，洛阳市城市建设委员会让第一拖拉机厂修改图纸，可是现在这个街坊又快要动工了，修改的图纸还没见拿出来。
    现在要求厂里先拿出这笔钱来修建这些公共服务设施，的确也是不无困难的。11月21日，我到第一拖拉机制造厂基本建设计划处访问的时候，最近从北京回来的同志说，他们刚到第一机械工业部会审了建厂总预算，部里有关负责同志决定，“因为同国家规定抵触，公共服务建筑的投资不得列入建厂总预算”。那末，这个具体问题又如何解决呢？厂里的同志写了个报告，还要等部里批呢。
    看来，只有国家经济委员会、国家建设委员会等中央有关部门立即采取有效的措施，统一各方面的思想，提出可以普遍执行的办法，这个问题才能解决。不管决定由哪个部门出钱也好，实行“六统”——统一投资、统一建筑、统一分配……也好，或者那怕是提出个统一的临时解决办法也好，也不管是决定在沿街楼房底层修建小型公共服务设施，或者是决定在街坊内适当地方修建综合商场，反正总应该设法保证街坊内的公共服务设施能同职工住宅同时修建起来。不然，争执继续进行，不合理的现象还不断制造，这既不是长久的办法，又何尝是“权宜之计”呢？
