Xinhua News Agency, Aba, 30th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Shijin reports: The Third Sub-delegation of the Central Delegation arrived yesterday afternoon in Aba, an important city on the border of Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces.

More than eight thousand people from all ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Han, and Hui, from all walks of life, welcomed the delegation. The welcoming line stretched from the Tusi Yamen (official residence) of Hua'er Gongchenglie, the Deputy Head of the Third Sub-delegation, Deputy Governor of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and the great Tusi (chieftain) of Mosang, all the way to the new urban area of Aba. In front of a tall archway inscribed with "Welcome Dear Ones," a team of Tibetan men and women residents of Aba City, dressed in festive costumes, performed the Guo Zhuang dance for the delegation, singing the praises of the Party and Chairman Mao for bringing them a happy life. Members of the Aba Zangfeng Agricultural Cooperative enthusiastically cheered for the delegation. In the past, they were unemployed poor people suffering from hunger and cold, and vagrants from other villages; this year, with the support of the government, they reclaimed wasteland, organized agricultural cooperatives, and achieved good harvests.

The more than seven hundred soldiers of the Mosang Tusi, dressed in uniform leopard-skin-trimmed robes and fox fur hats, riding horses, and carrying rifles with colorfully flagged racks, led by the Tusi’s several officers, greeted the delegation with the traditional ceremony for welcoming distinguished guests, with the leader carrying the Five-Star Red Flag.

As the delegation passed through the welcoming line, slogans of "Long Live the Communist Party of China," "Long Live Chairman Mao," and "Long Live the Great Unity of All Nationalities" rose one after another. In order to get a better look at the dear ones sent by the Central Government and Chairman Mao, people crowded around the delegation, unwilling to leave for a long time.

　　中央慰问团第三分团抵阿坝
　　各族人民八千多夹道欢迎
    新华社阿坝30日电　新华社记者王世晋报道，中央慰问团第三分团昨天下午来到了四川、甘肃、青海三省边境上的重要城市——阿坝。
    欢迎慰问团的藏、汉、回等各族各界人民共八千多人。欢迎行列从第三分团副团长、阿坝藏族自治州副州长、墨颡大土官华尔功臣烈的土官官寨一直排到阿坝新市区。在写有“欢迎亲人”的高大牌坊前，一队阿坝城内的藏族男女居民，穿着节日盛装，向慰问团表演锅装舞，他们歌颂着党和毛主席给他们带来了幸福的生活。阿坝藏锋农业社的社员们，热烈地向慰问团欢呼。他们过去都是些受苦挨饿的失业贫民，和从外乡来的流浪者；今年在政府的扶助下，他们开荒地，组织农业社，得到好收成。
    墨颡土官的七百多个土兵，穿戴着一色的豹皮边皮袄和狐毛帽，骑着马，背着插有各色彩旗的带架步枪，为头的打着五星红旗，在土官的几个带兵官率领下，用传统的迎接上宾的礼节迎接慰问团。
    慰问团在欢迎行列中通过时“中国共产党万岁”“毛主席万岁”“各民族大团结万岁”的口号声，此起彼落。人们为了想多看一下中央和毛主席派来的亲人，蜂拥在慰问团的前后左右，久久地不愿离去。
