Xinhua News Agency, Amman, December 19th: Jordanian Prime Minister Suleiman Nabulsi, in an interview with a "Picture" magazine reporter, said that Jordan has decided to take all necessary steps to end the British-Jordanian treaty and will abolish all British military bases in Jordan as soon as possible.
    Nabulsi confirmed that Arab countries are prepared to give Jordan financial assistance to replace the British aid Jordan is currently receiving.
    Nabulsi had already announced the Jordanian government's decision to abolish the Anglo-Jordanian treaty on November 27. In a later conversation, he explained that Jordan would not be able to abolish the treaty immediately until Jordan received financial assistance from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.
    On December 18, the Egyptian Embassy in Jordan issued a statement saying that Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia have decided to give Jordan 12 million Jordanian pounds in financial assistance each year. This amount is roughly equal to the amount of financial aid Britain gives Jordan each year.
    The Egyptian Embassy's statement said that Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia are willing to guarantee Jordan's financial situation starting from January 1957.

    约旦决采取步骤结束英约条约
    并将尽快废除所有英国在约军事基地
    据新华社19日讯　安曼消息：约旦首相苏莱曼·纳布西在接见“图画”周刊的记者时说，约旦已经决定采取一切必要的步骤来结束英国—约旦条约，并且将尽快地废除所有英国在约旦的军事基地。
    纳布西证实，阿拉伯国家准备给约旦以财政援助来代替约旦目前正在接受的英国的援助。
    纳布西在11月27日已经宣布了约旦政府要废除英—约条约的决定。他在后来的一次谈话中说明，在约旦从埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯得到财政援助以前，约旦还不能够马上废除这个条约。
    12月18日，埃及驻约旦大使馆发表声明说，埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯已经决定每年给约旦一千二百万约旦镑的财政援助。这个数目大致等于英国每年给约旦的财政援助的数目。
    埃及大使馆的声明说，埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯三国愿意从1957年1月份起保证约旦的财政情况。
