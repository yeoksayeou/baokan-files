    Sugarcane Unit Yield New Record
    Appears Again at Jianhua Agricultural Cooperative in Fujian Province
    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 30th - The Jianhua Agricultural Cooperative in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, creator of the highest national sugarcane yield record in 1955, has again created a new record of an average yield of 25,954 jin per mu on a 5.34-mu high-yield field this year. This is the estimate made by the National Sugarcane High-Yield Observation Group after partial harvesting at the Jianhua Cooperative. The average yield per mu of all 232 mu of sugarcane in the Jianhua Cooperative can also reach 20,000 jin, an increase of 27.9% compared to last year.
    Under the assistance of the county's agricultural technology extension station, the Jianhua Cooperative formulated technical operating procedures, adopted the triangular strip sowing method for dense planting, increased the number of effective stems per unit area, promoted spot application, frequent application, light application, and layered application of fertilizers, and adopted triangular seedling setting to control the number of stems per unit area. Therefore, despite suffering from more than fifty days of drought and two typhoon attacks this year, a high yield was still achieved.

    甘蔗单位产量新纪录
    又在福建省建华农业社出现
    新华社福州30日电　1955年全国甘蔗最高产量纪录创造者福建省仙游县建华农业社，今年在一块五分三厘四的丰产田上又创造了平均每亩产量二万五千九百五十四斤的新纪录，这是全国甘蔗丰产观摩团在建华社经过部分砍收后估算的。建华社全部二百三十二亩甘蔗的平均每亩产量也可达到二万斤，比去年增产27.9％。
    建华社在县农业技术推广站协助下制定了技术操作规程，全部采用三角条播法密植，增加了单位面积有效茎数，推广点施、勤施、薄施、分层施的施肥办法和采取三角定苗控制单位面积茎数，所以今年虽然遭受了五十多天旱灾和两度台风袭击，仍然得到丰产。
