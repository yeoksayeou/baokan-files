Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, 25th. Village cadres in Haicheng County, Fujian Province, have been spending more time in production during the autumn harvest and winter planting season, leading to increased income. Thirty-three key township cadres in Haicang District earned an average of more than fifty work points each during ten days of winter planting. Zhou Jintian, the Party Branch Secretary of Jinli Township, participated in production in a production team where winter planting was lagging behind, strengthening specific leadership and enabling the team to exceed its winter planting plan by more than thirty mu in four days. He himself earned more than twenty work points. Huang Nanshan, a cadre from Zhenhai Township, recently worked eight days in the cooperative in less than a month and also had time to grow vegetables on his private plot. He sold the vegetables for more than twenty yuan and paid off part of his debt. He was originally uneasy about his work due to debt, but now he is more active in his work.

In an investigation conducted in October, the Haicheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party found that the eighty-two township and town chiefs and Party branch secretaries throughout the county had averaged less than ten days of work since January, and other key cadres also had little time to participate in production. More than half of the key village cadres in the county were in debt, which affected their work morale. The reason why township cadres could not participate in production was, on the one hand, that county and district departments were randomly convening meetings and assigning tasks to them, and issuing them with reports indiscriminately; on the other hand, after the merger of townships and cooperatives, township cadres still relied on daily meetings to lead production. However, as the townships and cooperatives became larger, meetings were not easy to convene, and the meetings were not punctual, often dragging on for half a day. In order to change this situation, in addition to effectively changing the work style of the county and district leading organs, the Haicheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party paid special attention to helping township cadres improve their leadership methods. All townships streamlined meetings, clarified the focus of work, and formulated short-term work plans, generally studying and arranging work every three to five days, implementing division of labor and a system of key cadres being on duty. In addition, each township specifically divided the scope of work of the Party, government, and cooperative, consolidated the basic-level organizations in conjunction with basic-level elections, and abolished some concurrent positions held by key cadres. In this way, village cadres have time to go to agricultural cooperatives and production teams to specifically lead and participate in production.

### 精简会议　明确中心　拟定计划　分工负责  福建海澄乡村干部参加生产时间增多

    精简会议　明确中心　拟定计划　分工负责
    福建海澄乡村干部参加生产时间增多
    新华社厦门25日电　福建省海澄县的乡村干部在秋收冬种中参加生产的时间增多，收入增加。海沧区三十三个主要乡干部在十天冬种中平均每人得了五十多个工分。锦里乡党支部书记周金田到一个冬种进展迟缓的生产队参加生产，加强具体领导，使这个队在四天内超额三十多亩完成了冬种计划，他自己也得了二十多个工分。镇海乡干部黄南山最近不到一个月在社里出工八天，还有时间在自留地上种植蔬菜。他把蔬菜卖了二十多元，还了一部分债。原来因欠债而工作不安心，现在工作更积极了。
    中共海澄县委员会在10月间的调查中发现，全县八十二个乡、镇长和党支部书记从一月以来平均每人出工不到十天，其他主要干部也很少有时间参加生产。全县的乡村主要干部有一半以上欠债，工作情绪受到影响。乡干部不能参加生产的原因，一方面是县、区各部门乱抓他们开会和布置任务，给他们滥发表报；另一方面是并乡并社以后，乡干部领导生产的方法还是依靠每天开会，但是乡、社大了，会议不容易召集，开会又不准时，一拉就是半天。为了改变这种状况，中共海澄县委员会除切实改变县、区领导机关的工作作风以外，特别注意帮助乡干部改进领导方法。各乡都精简会议，明确工作中心，订出小段工作计划，一般三、五天研究安排一次工作，实行分工负责和主要干部值日制度。此外，各乡还具体划分了党、政、社的工作范围，结合基层选举整顿了各个基层组织，取消了主要干部的一些兼职。这样，乡村干部就有时间去各农业社、生产队，具体领导和参加生产。
