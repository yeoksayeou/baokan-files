Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 30th. The round table conference held by representatives and observers attending the Asian Writers Conference concluded on the afternoon of the 29th.

The round table conference issued a statement saying: "Due to the free and friendly exchange of opinions, we have all benefited, and we have all developed a desire to enhance mutual understanding.

"Everyone hopes that a world writers' conference can be held in the near future to enhance friendship, mutual understanding, and cultural exchange among writers from all countries around the world."

Before the end of the round table conference, Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Vice President Radhakrishnan spoke at the meeting.

In a brief speech, Nehru asked writers to be true to their ideals, and said that writers can and should play a major role in shaping people's minds. He pointed out that today, countries are naturally gradually influencing and interacting with each other on many issues, and this is also the case in literature. Therefore, the literature of one country becomes the property of many countries.

Radhakrishnan asked writers to uphold the attitude of universal friendship and love, regardless of differences in political systems.

He said: "Writers must contribute to society, not only to reflect it, but also to help improve it. This is the task of writers."

The famous Indian novelist Mulk Raj Anand pointed out that some countries are trying to prevent writers from different countries from interacting with each other, and are not providing them with the necessary facilities for meeting each other. He expressed regret about this situation. Regarding this point, he specifically pointed out that he wanted to visit the United States, but did not obtain a visa. He finally called on writers all over the world to unite in order to exert their influence on the world.

The American novelist Ira Morris said that with the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, a completely new world and a series of new responsibilities have emerged. "The task of writers is to touch people's consciences and tell them that the future of civilization is in danger." He hopes that new types of writers will emerge who will take a stand to maintain peace and oppose war.

The British playwright Phillipa Burrell said that there is definitely a cultural crisis, at least in Britain, because in this era of revolutionary changes in the world, no works of great significance have appeared in Britain.

The Soviet Kyrgyz poet Vikov showed the representatives many works by Chinese, Korean, and Indian writers translated into his native language. He promised to work harder on this translation work to promote mutual understanding and cultural exchange.

Argentina's Vicente Fatone agreed with the proposals made by other Latin American writers to take concrete measures to exchange works from Latin American and Asian countries and publish these works in these countries.

The chairman of the round table conference, Italian writer Carlo Levi, expressed his hope that writers from all over the world would meet in Italy in the near future.

Finally, all the representatives stood up and greeted each other warmly. The venue was filled with continuous cheers and warm applause. The round table conference was then declared over.

In addition to writers from Asian countries, writers from Australia, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Germany, Romania, Hungary, Argentina, Colombia, Guatemala, and Italy also participated in this round table conference.

    印度副总统和总理在会上致词
    新华社新德里30日电　参加亚洲作家会议的代表和观察员所举行的圆桌会议已经在29日下午结束。
    圆桌会议发表声明说：“由于自由而友好地交换了意见，我们大家都获得了好处，同时我们大家也产生了希望增进相互了解的愿望。
    “大家都希望在今后不久可以举行世界作家代表会议，以便增进全世界各国作家之间的友谊、互相谅解和文化交流。”
    在圆桌会议结束以前，印度总理尼赫鲁和副总统拉达克里希南在会上讲了话。
    尼赫鲁在简短的讲话中要求作家们忠于自己的理想，并且说，作家能够而且也应该在塑造人们的心灵方面发挥很大的作用。他指出，今天，各国都很自然地逐步地在许多问题上互相影响，交互反应，在文学方面也是如此，因此一国的文学就变成了许多国家的财产。
    拉达克里希南要求作家们坚持天下一家友好相爱的态度，不计较政治制度的差别。
    他说：“作家们必须对社会作出贡献，不仅是要反映它，而且是要帮助改进它。这就是作家的任务。”
    印度著名小说家穆尔克·拉志·阿南德指出，某些国家设法阻止不同的国家的作家互相来往，不向他们提供为了互相会见而需要的便利，他对于这种情况表示遗憾。关于这一点，他特别指出，他本想访问美国，但是没有获得签证。他最后要求全世界作家团结起来，以便发挥他们对世界的影响。
    美国小说家艾拉·摩里斯说，随着在广岛投掷第一颗原子弹，已经产生了一个全新的世界和一系列的新的责任。“作家的任务就是要感动人们的良心，并且告诉他们，文明的前途遭到了危险。”他希望会出现采取维护和平、反对战争的立场的新型作家。
    英国戏剧家菲莉帕·伯勒耳女士说，至少在英国是肯定地存在着文化危机，因为在这个世界上发生革命性的变化的时期，英国却没有出现过什么有重大意义的作品。
    苏联吉尔吉斯诗人维科夫把许多翻译成他本民族语文的中国、朝鲜和印度作家的著作给代表们看。他保证要更加努力从事这种翻译工作，来促进互相了解和文化交流。
    阿根廷的维森特·法托内赞成其他拉丁美洲作家提出的主张，就是采取具体办法来交换拉丁美洲和亚洲国家的作品，并且在这些国家里出版这些作品。
    圆桌会议主席、意大利作家卡洛·勒维表示希望世界各国作家在不久的将来在意大利会面。
    最后全体代表起立，热情地互相致意，会场发出不断的欢呼声和热烈的掌声。圆桌会议至此宣告结束。
    参加这次圆桌会议的除亚洲各国作家以外还有澳大利亚、英国、美国、苏联、德国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、阿根廷、哥伦比亚、危地马拉和意大利的作家。
