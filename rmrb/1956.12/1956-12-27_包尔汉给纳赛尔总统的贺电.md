Baorhan's Congratulatory Telegram to President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and please forward to the brothers and sisters of Egypt and the heroic people of Port Said:
    We, the entire Chinese people, with the same joy and excitement as you, congratulate you on the liberation of Port Said, congratulate you on driving out the last soldier of the Anglo-French invaders, and congratulate you on achieving a great victory!
    This victory is not only a great victory for the oppressed nations in their struggle against colonialism, but also a great victory for the forces of peace over the forces of war!
    The Anglo-French invaders dispatched 160,000 troops, over 100 warships, and over 2,000 aircraft, dreaming of conquering Egypt within a week. Today, they have received their final answer. This answer is the heavy blow and severe lesson given to them by the heroic Egyptian people and the peace-loving people of the world. This is the shameful failure of being driven out of Egyptian territory!
    The heroic Egyptian people not only defended their motherland with blood, but also defended the banner of peace, freedom, and independence for the people of the world, writing a glorious and splendid page in world history! They have proven that a just battle will receive the support of the friendly hands of the whole world and can never be defeated!
    Egypt has proudly proven to the world that the Egyptian people are heroic, and the people of Port Said are even more heroic examples! They are an important force in defending peace in the Middle East and fighting against colonialism!
    Dear Egyptian brothers! The colonialists will not willingly admit defeat. The Anglo-French invading forces are still stationed on the Egyptian border, their accomplice Israel has not yet withdrawn from the Sinai Peninsula, and the Anglo-French invaders and certain imperialist countries are plotting to infringe upon the sovereignty of the Suez Canal and control the Middle East region. Dear Egyptian brothers, we must be vigilant; the struggle is not over!
    Thoroughly destroying the colonialists' conspiracies to safeguard Egypt's sovereignty and independence and restore peace in the Middle East remains a serious task for the future. Dear Egyptian brothers and sisters, in every step of your future struggles, the 600 million Chinese people will be closely linked with you!
    Salute to the heroic Egyptian brothers and their heroic Port Said!
    Salute to President Nasser, who led the people to victory against aggression! Wishing you to move from victory to greater victory!
    President of the China-Egypt Friendship Association, Baorhan
                December 26, 1956

    包尔汉给纳赛尔总统的贺电敬爱的加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔总统并请转埃及的兄弟姊妹和英雄的塞得港人民：
    我们全中国人民用和你们一样欢欣鼓舞的心情，祝贺塞得港的光复，祝贺你们赶走了英法侵略者的最后一兵，祝贺你们取得了伟大的胜利！
    这个胜利不只是被压迫民族反抗殖民主义斗争的伟大胜利，而且是和平力量打败战争势力的伟大胜利！
    英法侵略者曾出动了十六万陆军，一百多艘军舰，二千多架次飞机，梦想在一个星期之内征服埃及，今天他们得到最后的答复了。这个答复就是英勇的埃及人民和全世界爱好和平人民给他们的沉重的打击和一顿狠狠的教训，这就是滚出埃及国境的可耻的失败！
    英勇的埃及人民不仅仅用鲜血保卫了自己的祖国，而且保卫了全世界人民的和平、自由、独立的旗帜，在世界历史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页！他们证明正义的战斗是会得到全世界友谊的手的支持的，是永远不可能被战胜的！
    埃及已经自豪地向全世界证明，埃及人民是英雄的，塞得港人民更是英雄的榜样！他们是保卫中近东和平以及反对殖民主义的斗争的重要的力量！
    亲爱的埃及弟兄们！殖民主义者是不会甘心承认失败的。英法侵略军队还屯兵埃及边境，他们的同谋者以色列还没有撤出西奈半岛，英法侵略者和某些帝国主义国家妄想侵犯苏伊士运河主权，控制中近东地区的阴谋正在进行。亲爱的埃及兄弟们，我们要提高警惕，斗争并没有结束！
    彻底摧毁殖民主义者的阴谋诡计以维护埃及主权独立和恢复中近东地区的和平还是今后严重的斗争任务。亲爱的埃及兄弟姊妹们，在你们今后的每一步斗争中，六万万中国人民都将紧密地挽着你们的手！
    向英勇的埃及兄弟和他们的英雄塞得港致敬！
    向领导人民取得反侵略胜利的纳赛尔总统致敬！祝你们从胜利走向更大的胜利！
    中埃友好协会会长　包尔汉
                1956年12月26日
