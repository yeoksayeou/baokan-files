Cairo Dispatch

    “The Motherland Needs Us”
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun
    If the accompanying Egyptian friend hadn't explained it to us, and if a group of teachers in plain clothes hadn't greeted us at the door, you would have mistaken it for a military camp. From the front gate to the backyard, soldiers could be seen everywhere. They saluted us with standard military bearing. On the sports ground, many teams were receiving basic training. Next to some tables, mechanics were repairing some British Thompson submachine guns and Soviet rifles. There is a prevalent saying here that Soviet weapons are very useful and easy to learn how to use, and Egyptian youths are very willing to get such weapons.
    This is indeed not a military camp, but a boys' middle school in the northern district of Cairo. Since the outbreak of the resistance war against the Anglo-French aggression, this school has become the headquarters of the National Guard in this district. The soldiers we saw were not regular soldiers, but National Guard members who were conscripted to receive military training and defend the motherland.
    The commander is a tall and handsome colonel. He introduced us to the military deployment situation in his defense zone. The entire district is divided into three sub-districts. Each sub-district is commanded by a major, whose responsibility is to incorporate citizens into the National Guard and other teams to defend the district. They selected robust youths between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one from the thousands of young people and students who resolutely requested to join the army after the outbreak of the war, and provided them with street fighting training against the enemy, so that they could launch powerful battles street by street when in crisis.
    Standing in front of a map of the district, the commander explained the operational plan to repel the enemy, and then talked about the National Guard. The National Guard was established about three years ago, with the participation of students, workers, and youths from all walks of life. Youth camps were also established in schools. In the middle school we visited, there was a youth camp with two hundred students participating. After the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company, mass resistance movements were organized. The Egyptian government established the National Liberation Army to unify the command of all these forces. Therefore, the National Liberation Army includes three parts: the National Guard, the Youth Team, and the Mass Resistance Movement. The Mass Resistance Movement played a very important role in the resistance struggle of the people of Port Said.
    Not only young men participate in the National Guard, but also young women. They are called the Women's Guard. In a girls' school, we saw twenty girls in National Guard uniforms doing exercises on the playground. They were lying down and shooting; the echoes of gunfire reverberated in the campus and neighboring buildings. There was no makeup on their faces. They reminded people of the hardships of this great era. They demonstrated no less enthusiasm and determination than the young men.
    There is a blood donation station in this school. In a room, two young men donated their blood to the motherland. One of them was named Kamel Ahmed El Nara, a teacher who was only twenty-four years old. He said: "Our motherland needs us, so I am very willing to donate my blood. Compared with the sacrifices on the front lines, my blood is just a drop in the ocean." He told us that after the outbreak of the war, he participated in the work of the first aid station and the fire brigade.
    In Cairo, first aid stations and hospitals have been set up throughout the city. In another district we visited, there were eleven first aid stations. They are all located in schools, and the school's teachers, staff, and doctors are all participating in the work. Within twenty-four hours after the outbreak of the war, a hospital was set up in a girls' school on a quiet street. It has thirty beds, which were originally used by students. This hospital received 148 wounded soldiers transported from the Sinai Peninsula. Due to the short duration of the war, many other hospitals and first aid stations have not yet received wounded soldiers, but they are all ready at all times so that they can work once the enemy launches an attack.
    In these hospitals and first aid stations, many women (mostly housewives from middle-class families) are receiving one to four weeks of medical training. In a women's physical education teachers college, about two hundred women are receiving this kind of training. We heard that their courses are: ten days of study, ten days of internship, and ten days of military drills. On the playground, there were two women's squads doing exercises. Judging from their attire, most of them came from wealthy families.
    Women in Cairo not only work in hospitals, but also organize to sew clothes for the army and refugees. In Cairo, there are fifteen such sewing and first aid central stations. Like first aid stations and hospitals, these central stations are led by the Ministry of Education. We visited one such central station. The clatter of sewing machines came from every room. Women of all ages were sitting in front of sewing machines, rushing to make bed sheets, uniforms, and Arab robes, hats, and refugee armbands. The raw materials are supplied by the government. Working in this central station are three hundred female teachers, female students, and housewives, half of whom are sewing and the other half are serving as first aiders.
    In a girls' middle school that is now a first aid station, we saw such slogans: The duty of women in war is to encourage husbands and sons to join the army, and to participate in sewing and first aid work. However, it is clear that the women of Cairo are not limited to doing these jobs, they are also directly participating in the army to defend their motherland.
    If necessary, the youth and women of Egypt are willing to dedicate everything to the motherland. They are well aware that when the enemy has not given up its ambition to aggress, they must be ready to fight at all times. (December 15)

### “祖国需要我们”

    “祖国需要我们”
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    要不是陪伴的埃及朋友向我们说明，要不是有一群身穿便服的教师在门口相迎，那末你准会把它当成兵营了。从前门直到后院，到处可以见到军人们在活动。他们用标准的军人气概向我们敬礼。在运动场上，有许多队在接受基本训练。在一些桌子旁边，机械士在修理着一些英国汤姆枪和苏联步枪。这儿盛传着这样的一种说法：苏联武器很好用，也容易学会使用，埃及青年们都很愿意拿到这样的武器。
    这儿确实不是一个兵营，而是开罗市北区的一所男子中学。自从反抗英、法侵略的抵抗战争爆发以来，这所学校已变为本区的国民警卫队的司令部。我们所见到的军人并非是正规军人，而是应征接受军事训练、保卫祖国的国民警卫队队员。
    司令官是一位魁梧英俊的上校。他向我们介绍了他的防区的军事部署情况。全区分成三个小区。每个小区由一位少校指挥，他的职责是把市民编入国民警卫队和其他队伍里，以保卫本区。他们从战争爆发后坚决要求参军的成千上万的青年和学生中，挑选出十八岁到二十一岁的健壮青年，施以对敌巷战训练，以便危急之时可以逐街逐道地展开有力的战斗。
    站在本区地图面前，司令官向我们讲解了迎击敌人的作战计划，然后又谈到国民警卫队的事情。国民警卫队大约是在三年前建立的，参加的有学生、工人和各阶层的青年。在学校里还成立了青年营。在我们访问的这所中学里，就有一个青年营，有两百名学生参加。在苏伊士运河公司国有化之后，群众抵抗运动组织起来了。埃及政府建立了民族解放军，来统一指挥所有这些力量。因此，民族解放军包含三个部分：国民警卫队、青年队和群众抵抗运动。群众抵抗运动在塞得港人民的反抗斗争中起了很重要的作用。
    参加国民警卫队的不仅有小伙子，还有姑娘们。她们叫女子警卫队。在一所女子学校里，我们看到了二十名穿着国民警卫队制服的姑娘，正在操场上上操。她们在卧倒和射击；枪声的回响在校园里和邻近建筑物里震荡着。她们的脸上没有脂粉。她们使人想到这个伟大时代的艰难困苦。她们表现了不亚于小伙子们的热诚和决心。
    这所学校里有一个输血站。在一间房间里，两个青年向祖国献出了他们的热血。其中一人名字叫卡默尔·阿哈默德·厄·纳拉，是个年仅二十四岁的教师。他说：“我们的祖国需要我们，因此我很愿意献出我的血。比起在前线的牺牲来，我的血只是大海中之一滴。”他告诉我们说，他在战争爆发后，就参加了急救站和消防队的工作。
    在开罗，全市都设立了急救站和医院。在我们所访问的另一个区里，有十一个急救站。它们都设在学校里，学校的教师、员工和医生都参加了工作。战火爆发后的二十四小时内，就在一条幽静的街道上的一所女子学校里设立起一所医院。它有三十个床位，这原来是学生们用的。这所医院接收了一百四十八名从西奈半岛运来的伤员。由于战争时间的短促，其他许多医院和急救站还没有接收过伤员，但是它们全都时刻准备着，以便一旦敌人发动进攻时就可以工作了。
    在这些医院和急救站里，许多妇女（大部分是中等人家的主妇）在接受一至四周的医务训练。在一所女子体育师范学院里，有两百名左右妇女接受这种训练。我们听说她们的课程是，学习十天、实习十天、军事操练十天。在操场上有两个妇女小队在上操。从她们的服饰看来，大部分系来自富有之家。
    开罗的妇女不仅在医院里工作，而且还组织起来为军队和逃难者缝制衣着。在开罗，这种缝纫和急救的中心站有十五个。跟急救站和医院一样，这些中心站都是由教育部领导的。我们访问过一个这样的中心站。每个房间里传来了缝纫机的??声。老老少少的妇女，坐在缝纫机前赶制被单、制服和阿拉伯袍，帽子和难民的臂章。原材料是政府供给的。在这个中心站里工作的，有三百名女教师、女学生和主妇，其中一半人在缝纫，另一半人担任急救。
    在一所现在已成急救站的女子中学里，我们看到了这样的标语：妇女在战争中的职责是，鼓励丈夫和儿子参军，参加缝纫和急救工作。但是，很明显，开罗的妇女并不限于做这些工作，她们还直接参加军队，去保卫她们的祖国。
    如果需要的话，埃及青年和妇女们愿意向祖国献出自己的一切。他们十分清楚，当敌人还没有放弃侵略的野心的时候，他们必须时刻准备着战斗。　（12月15日）
