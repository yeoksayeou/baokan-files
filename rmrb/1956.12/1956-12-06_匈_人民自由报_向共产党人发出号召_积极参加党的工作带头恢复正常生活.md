Budapest Dispatch: The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party organ, "People's Freedom," published an editorial on December 2, calling on communists to join the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party.

The editorial stated that the Hungarian communist movement is in a state of serious difficulty. The party organizations of the Socialist Workers' Party are being established comprehensively and successively. Many communists have not yet participated in party work, and some are temporarily waiting and seeing, and have not yet joined the party. Although the number of party organizations is still small, they have already begun to carry out political and organizational work.

This editorial refuted the rumors spread by Western radio stations and newspapers that denigrate the Socialist Workers' Party, and criticized the views of some people in the country who distrust communists. The editorial pointed out that some people even want to remove former cadres of the Labor People's Party from their jobs. Hidden behind this is the counter-revolutionary intention to drive communists out of social life. Unfortunately, some of our comrades do not yet understand that persecuting former party cadres is very unfair.

The editorial gave an example: The Party sent cadres who were recently relieved of their duties back to production jobs. Recently, something like this happened. A cadre who used to work in a state went to a hospital in Budapest to register as a boiler worker. The hospital originally wanted to hire him, but when they saw on his work permit that he had been a party cadre, they told him that the hospital did not need him. Isn't this a new form of the infamous counter-revolutionary blacklist of the past? It is no different from the despicable methods used by the Horthy secret police.

The editorial said that we must not forget that most cadres and party members are respected people. We should not believe those who curse communists and drive party members from their jobs and social life in the "name of the people." The editorial said: Many people have not yet seen how great a threat the Hungarian counter-revolution poses to the lives of our people and world peace. Communists should always fight on these two fronts.

The editorial went on to say that we demand a pure party. We want to build this party together with communists and honest workers. Our party ranks are still small today. But we don't need careerists or speculators. The party needs communists who are tempered in struggle and who take the lead in restoring normal life through their actions.

### 匈“人民自由报”向共产党人发出号召　积极参加党的工作带头恢复正常生活

　　匈“人民自由报”向共产党人发出号召
　　积极参加党的工作带头恢复正常生活
    本报讯　布达佩斯消息：匈牙利社会主义工人党机关报“人民自由报”12月2日发表社论，号召共产党人参加匈牙利社会主义工人党。
    社论说，匈牙利共产主义运动处在严重的困难情况中。社会主义工人党的党组织正在全面陆续建立。有许多共产党人今天还未参加党的工作，也有人暂时抱着等待态度，还未参加党。虽然目前党组织的数目还不多，但是它们已经开始进行政治工作和组织工作。
    这篇社论驳斥了西方国家的电台和报纸所散布的诋毁社会主义工人党的谣言，并且批评了国内一些人不信任共产党人的看法。社论指出，甚至有人要把前劳动人民党的干部从工作岗位上撤换掉。这后面隐藏着反革命的意图，即把共产党人从社会生活中赶走。可惜，我们同志中的一部分还不了解，迫害过去党的干部是很不公平的事。
    社论举例说：党把不久前还是脱产的干部派回生产工作岗位。近日来发生了这样的事。有一名以前在州内工作的干部到一个布达佩斯医院报名去当锅炉工人，医院本来要录用他，但看见他的工作证上写着他曾经作过党的干部，就告诉他医院不需要他。这不就是过去臭名昭彰的反革命黑名单的新形式吗？这和霍尔蒂秘密警察所使用的卑鄙方法没有两样。
    社论说，我们不能忘记，大部分干部和党员都是受人尊重的人。我们不应当相信那些咒骂共产党人并且以“人民的名义”把党员从工作岗位和社会生活中赶走的人。社论说：许多人还未看清匈牙利的反革命对我国人民的生活和世界和平是多么大的威胁。共产党人永远应该在这两条战线上进行斗争。
    社论接着说，我们要求纯洁的党。我们要同共产党人和正直的劳动者一起建立这个党。我们党的队伍今天还小。但是我们不需要钻营分子、投机分子。党需要在斗争中锻炼起来的、在恢复正常生活中用行动带动别人的共产党人。
