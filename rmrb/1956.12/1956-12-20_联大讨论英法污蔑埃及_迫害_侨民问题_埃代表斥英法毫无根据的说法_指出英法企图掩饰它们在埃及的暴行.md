Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th: During the United Nations General Assembly meeting on the 18th, after discussing the issue of amending the Charter, the meeting proceeded to discuss the "accusations" by Britain and France against Egypt regarding the "persecution" of British and French nationals.

French representative M. Destin insisted that the Egyptian government had launched a "systematic campaign" to "expel French citizens residing in Egypt and confiscate their property." He slandered Egypt for violating the basic principles of international law and hindering the implementation of UN resolutions regarding Egypt, and demanded that Egypt's actions be "condemned."

British representative Dixon also spoke about the alleged "persecution" of British nationals by Egypt and made the same demands as the French representative.

Egyptian representative Lutfi sharply criticized the statements of the British and French representatives. He pointed out that just as the British and French aggression against Egypt had failed, they were now trying to gain political advantage by insisting that the Egyptian government had "violated" international law and the UN Charter. This argument is completely unfounded. In reality, the Egyptian government, in response to the situation that had developed, had taken certain measures to relocate foreign nationals to prevent the disruption of social order. Egypt had established a special committee to discuss all issues related to the relocation of foreign nationals, including possible accusations by foreign nationals. No French national had been interfered with, and no French national had been investigated.

The Egyptian representative pointed out that the Egyptian government was exercising its legitimate sovereignty in seizing the property of nationals of the aggressor countries. The Egyptian representative asked the British and French representatives to recall that as recently as June of this year, their governments unilaterally froze Egyptian funds, at a time when relations between Britain, France, and Egypt were more normal.

Lutfi concluded by saying that it was as if France and Britain had quickly forgotten their bloody aggression against the Egyptian people, the bombing of peaceful cities, and the killing of peaceful Egyptian citizens. Egypt expressed surprise that representatives of the aggressor countries dared to claim at the United Nations that Egypt had "violated" international law.

Representatives of Sudan, Syria, and Iraq, speaking in support of Egypt, also believed that the speeches by the British and French representatives were a propaganda ploy aimed at diverting world public attention from the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt and their brutal actions in Egypt, and diverting attention from the new conspiracies currently being undertaken by colonial powers in the Near East.

Speaking on the procedural aspects of the meeting, Soviet representative Kuznetsov said that the issue under discussion was an important one, and therefore, he suggested that the issue be left for further discussion on the 19th.

Seeing that the discussion of the issues raised by the French and British representatives was turning unfavorable to the aggressors, U.S. representative Wadsworth hurriedly came to their aid. He suggested ending the discussion at that meeting, clearly wanting to cancel the discussion. However, this attempt was unsuccessful. The meeting decided to discuss the issue again on the 19th, after discussing amending the United Nations Charter to increase the number of non-permanent members of the Security Council.

    联大讨论英法污蔑埃及“迫害”侨民问题
    埃代表斥英法毫无根据的说法
    指出英法企图掩饰它们在埃及的暴行
    据新华社19日讯　纽约消息：在联合国大会18日会议讨论修改宪章的问题以后，会议就英法两国“控诉”埃及“迫害”英法侨民的问题进行讨论。
    法国代表德斯丹硬说埃及政府发动了一个“有系统的运动”来“驱逐住在埃及的法国公民和没收他们的财产”。他污蔑埃及违反国际法的基本原则和妨碍联合国关于埃及的决议的执行，并且要求“谴责”埃及的行动。
    英国代表狄克逊也谈到所谓埃及“迫害”英国侨民的问题，并且提出法国代表提出的同样要求。
    埃及代表卢特菲尖锐抨击英法代表的说法。他指出，正当英法两国对埃及的侵略行为已经破产的时候，它们正在力图在政治上取得优势，硬说埃及政府“破坏”国际法和联合国宪章。这种论调是完全没有根据的。实际上，埃及政府针对所形成的局势，采取了某些迁徙外国侨民的措施，以防止社会秩序遭到破坏。埃及曾经成立了一个专门委员会来讨论同迁徙外国侨民有关的一切问题，其中包括外国侨民的可能的控诉。任何一个法国侨民都没有受到干涉，任何一个法国侨民都没有受到调查。
    埃及代表指出，埃及政府行使自己的合法主权，扣押了侵略国侨民的财产。埃及代表向英国和法国代表提出，还在今年6月，它们国家的政府就片面地冻结了埃及的基金，而当时，英法两国和埃及之间的关系是更为正常的。
    卢特菲最后说，这就好像是法国和英国很快就忘记了它们对埃及人民的血腥侵略、轰炸和平城市和杀害埃及的和平公民的事情。埃及表示惊奇的是，侵略国代表竟敢在联合国声言埃及“破坏”国际法。
    发言支持埃及的苏丹、叙利亚和伊拉克的代表也认为英法两国代表的讲话是一种宣传手腕，目的是使世界公众转移对英、法和以色列侵略埃及这件事以及它们在埃及的残暴行为的注意，转移对殖民国家目前在近东所采取的新的阴谋的注意。
    就会议的进行程序发言的苏联代表库兹涅佐夫说，目前所讨论的问题是一个重要的问题，因而，他建议把这个问题留到19日再次讨论。
    鉴于对法英两国代表所提出的问题的讨论转而不利于侵略者，美国代表华兹沃斯急忙来帮助他们。他建议在这次会上结束讨论，这显然是想要取消这个讨论。但是，这种企图并没有成功。会议决定在19日、在讨论修改联合国宪章以增加安全理事会非常任理事国的数目以后再来讨论这个问题。
