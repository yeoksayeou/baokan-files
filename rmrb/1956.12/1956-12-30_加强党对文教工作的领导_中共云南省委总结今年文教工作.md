    Strengthen the Party's Leadership over Cultural and Educational Work
    中共云南省委总结今年文教工作
    The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of cultural and educational ministers from the prefectural, municipal, and some county committees from December 20th to 27th. At the meeting, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress of the Party and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, a relatively comprehensive summary and review of the province's cultural, educational, and health work in 1956 was conducted. Based on the principles of strengthening leadership, improving quality, streamlining and economizing, working hard and living plainly, and achieving more with less money, the direction and tasks of cultural and educational work for next year were determined.

    With the arrival of the upsurge in socialist construction in Yunnan Province, cultural, educational, and health undertakings have developed rapidly in 1956. Taking education alone, the number of secondary schools in the province has increased from 162 last year to 191 this year, and the number of students enrolled has increased from more than 70,000 to more than 100,000. The number of primary schools has increased from 12,557 last year to 13,497 this year, and the number of children enrolled has increased from 1.2 million to more than 1.5 million. Other undertakings such as universities, health, culture, and science have also developed considerably. Along with the development of cultural and educational undertakings, the ranks of cadres in the cultural and educational system have also grown significantly. In particular, a certain number of leading cadres have been adjusted and assigned in a planned way, and a batch of new Party members and Youth League members have been developed, thus expanding the size and strengthening the leadership of the entire cultural and educational team. Significant achievements have also been made in implementing the Party's policy towards intellectuals, and the socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of intellectuals has been significantly enhanced. The meeting also emphasized that there are still many shortcomings in this year's cultural and educational work. In particular, in the development of certain undertakings, there has been a situation of only considering needs and disregarding possibilities, emphasizing quantity and neglecting quality. This has brought many difficulties to future work.

    In order to further promote the healthy development of cultural and educational work, the task for next year is to strengthen the Party's leadership and focus mainly on consolidation and improvement, with basically no major development. Great importance should also be attached to vigorously utilizing the strength of the people and organizing mass activities under the principle of not increasing the burden on the masses and meeting their needs. To this end, the meeting focused on studying how to strengthen the management of cadres in the cultural and educational system, the work of Party grassroots organizations, and further implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals, examining and criticizing the trend of subjectivism and weakening of political work that has grown in the cultural and educational system, and emphasizing the need to further establish a mass line work style and do a good job in the Party's political and ideological work. In order to further strengthen the Party's leadership over cultural and educational work, the Provincial Committee pointed out that in the future, Party committees at all levels should designate one secretary to manage cultural and educational work, and place this work firmly under the leadership and supervision of the Party. It also called for systematically filling vacancies for key leading cadres in government cultural and educational departments, as well as in schools, hospitals, theatrical troupes, and other cultural and health departments. Importance should be attached to the training of a large number of new members. In cultivating new forces, the enthusiasm of existing veteran teachers, veteran technical cadres, and veteran actors should be fully relied upon and brought into play. In addition, the meeting analyzed and criticized the current thinking of some cadres who are not content with cultural and educational work and consider it a "cold field."

    加强党对文教工作的领导
    中共云南省委总结今年文教工作
    本报讯　中共云南省委从12月20日至27日召开了地委、市委及部分县委的文教部长会议。会上按照党的第八次代表大会精神及二中全会精神，比较全面地总结和检查了全省1956年的文教卫生工作，并本着加强领导、提高质量、精简节约、艰苦朴素和少花钱多办事的原则，确定了明年文教工作的方针和任务。
    云南省随着社会主义建设高潮的到来，1956年的文教卫生事业有了迅速的发展。只从教育事业上看，全省中等学校已由去年的一百六十二所增加到今年的一百九十一所，在校学生已由七万多人增加到十万多人；小学已由去年的一万二千五百五十七所增加到今年的一万三千四百九十七所，入学儿童已由一百二十万人增加到一百五十多万人。其他如大学、卫生、文化和科学等事业  都有相当发展。随着文教事业的发展，文教系统的干部队伍也有很大增长。特别是有计划地调整和配备了一定数量的领导骨干，新发展了一批党员和团员，因而使得整个文教队伍数量扩大了，领导也加强了。在贯彻党对知识分子的政策上，也取得了很大的成绩，广大知识分子的社会主义积极性有了显著的提高。会议也着重指出了今年的文教工作上还存在许多缺点。特别是在某些事业的发展上，存在着只顾需要不顾可能、偏重数量忽视质量的情况。这就给今后的工作带来了不少困难。
    为了进一步使文教工作健康发展，明年的任务是在基本不作较大的发展的情况下，加强党的领导，把主要力量放在巩固和提高上。并要十分重视在不加重群众负担、满足群众需要的原则下，大力运用民间力量，组织群众性的活动。为此，着重研究了如何加强文教系统的干部管理工作、党的基层组织工作，以及进一步贯彻党的知识分子政策，检查和批判了目前在文教系统中有所滋长的主观主义、削弱政治工作的倾向，强调必须进一步地树立群众路线的工作作风，做好党的政治思想工作。为了进一步加强党对文教工作的领导，省委指出今后各级党委应固定书记之一管理文教工作，把这一工作切实地置于党的领导和监督之下；有计划地分别将政府部门中的文教主管科及学校、医院、剧团等各个文教卫生部门的主要领导骨干的缺额配备起来；并要重视对大量新成员的培养和训练。在培养新生力量时，要充分依靠和发挥现有老教师、老技术干部、老演员的积极性。此外，会上还对于目前某些少数干部不安心于文教工作，认为文教工作是“冷门”的思想作了分析批判。
