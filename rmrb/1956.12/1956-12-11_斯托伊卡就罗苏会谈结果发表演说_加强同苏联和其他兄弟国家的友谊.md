    Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 10th: TASS reported from Bucharest that on the evening of December 8th, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, Stoica, delivered a radio address on Bucharest Radio regarding the results of the Moscow Romanian-Soviet talks.

    Stoica said that the Romanian-Soviet talks were conducted in a spirit of cooperation and solidarity. During the talks, we requested the Soviet government to assist us in overcoming a series of difficulties we encountered on the road to realizing the program of developing the national economy and continuously improving the material and cultural living standards of our working people. The Soviet government expressed full understanding of the needs of our national economy, agreed to our requests, and gave us some important economic and financial preferences, which is a huge support for completing our economic construction tasks. Thanks to the grain assistance obtained from the Soviet Union, the food supply for our residents has been guaranteed.

    Stoica said that this year's poor harvest has caused some difficulties for our country's foreign trade balance. Considering this situation, the Soviet government voluntarily decided to amend the Soviet rights in the matter of Romania redeeming the Soviet shares in the former SovRom joint ventures in accordance with our interests. The Soviet Union also transferred all the property formerly belonging to Hitler's Germany and included as Soviet shares in the Romanian-Soviet joint ventures to Romania free of charge, and gave up all the profits it was entitled to. In addition, the Soviet government agreed that the additional amount due to the Soviet Union could be repaid in lei (Romanian currency) over a long period of time, which is much more beneficial to Romania than repaying in foreign exchange.

    Stoica concluded by saying that the Moscow talks were talks between friends and comrades, and nothing can divide us; everything brings us closer and unites us. These talks once again confirmed that in any case, we can rely on the friendship and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. We will unswervingly strengthen our friendship with the Soviet Union and all socialist countries.

    斯托伊卡就罗苏会谈结果发表演说
    加强同苏联和其他兄弟国家的友谊
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：12月8日晚间，罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡就莫斯科罗苏会谈结果在布加勒斯特电台发表了广播演说。
    斯托伊卡说，罗苏会谈是本着合作和团结的精神举行的。在会谈过程中，我们请求苏联政府协助我们克服我们在实现发展国民经济和不断提高我国劳动人民物质和文化生活水平纲领的道路上所遇到的一系列困难。苏联政府表示完全理解我国国民经济的需要，答应了我们的要求，给我们一些重要的经济和财政的优惠，这对完成我国经济建设任务是一项巨大的支援。由于从苏联获得谷物援助，我国居民的粮食供应已经有了保证。
    斯托伊卡说，今年的歉收对我国的对外贸易平衡造成了某些困难。考虑到这种情况，苏联政府主动地决定按照我们的利益修改在罗马尼亚赎回前苏罗股份公司中的苏联股份这件事上苏联应得的权利。苏联还把以前属于希特勒德国的、作为苏联股份加入罗苏混合企业的全部财产无偿地让给罗马尼亚，并且放弃了它应得的全部利润。此外，苏联政府同意苏联应得的另外的款额可以在长时期内以列伊（罗币名）偿付，这对罗马尼亚说来比用外汇偿付要有利得多。
    斯托伊卡最后说，莫斯科会谈是朋友之间、同志之间的会谈，没有任何东西能分裂我们，一切都使我们亲近和团结。这次会谈再一次证实，在任何情况下，我们都可以依靠同苏联和其他社会主义国家的友谊和互助。我们将始终不渝地加强同苏联和各社会主义国家的友谊。
