Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 27th: The Asian Writers' Conference continued on the 25th and 26th. Delegates heard reports on the development of literature in various Indian languages and a report by Dr. Nafisi on the Persian language in Iran.

    In the meetings of the four committees, writers from various countries exchanged views on four major issues: "The Writer and Freedom," "Asian Tradition," "The Writer and Profession," and "Cultural Exchange."

    In the committee on the writer and freedom, Indian delegate Abdul Aleem, a professor at Aligarh University, said that those who say writers have so-called absolute freedom are actually demanding to be free from various social obligations. He said that writers must enjoy freedom, but at the same time must bear existing social obligations.

    Gangadhar Gadgil, representing Marathi writers and closely associated with the Indian Committee for Cultural Freedom, believed that works of art "can only be created when a person is in a solitary environment and least subject to social pressure."

    Soviet delegate An. Sofronov supported the opinion of Wu Deng Peimi, head of the Burmese delegation. Wu Deng Peimi said that writers must have freedom, but this "is not to oppose the people, but to serve the people."

    In the committee meeting discussing the writer and profession, Soviet delegate Simonov said in his speech that this issue is closely related to the relationship between writers and readers.

    Indian speakers repeatedly mentioned the lack of opportunities to publish their works and contribute them to readers.

    On the evening of the 26th, the Indian delegation participating in the Asian Writers' Conference held a tea party to entertain representatives and observers from other writers.

    亚洲作家会议继续开会
    许多代表认为作家应为人民服务
    据新华社新德里27日电　亚洲作家会议25、26日两日继续举行会议。代表们听取了关于印度各种语文的文学的发展的报告和纳菲西博士所作的关于伊朗的波斯语的报告。
    在四个委员会会议上，各国作家们就“作家和自由”、“亚洲的传统”、“作家和职业”和“文化交流”四大问题交换意见。
    在作家和自由问题委员会上，印度代表、阿里加大学教授阿卜杜勒·阿利姆说，说作家有所谓绝对自由的人们，实际上是要求不受各种社会义务的约束。他说，作家必须享有自由，但是同时必须承担现有的社会义务。
    与印度文化自由委员会有密切联系的、代表马拉提语作家的甘加达尔·加德吉尔认为，艺术作品“只有一个人在孤独的环境中而最不受社会压力的时候才能创作出来”。
    苏联代表安·索弗罗诺夫支持缅甸代表团团长吴登佩密的意见。吴登佩密说，作家必须有自由，但这“不是为了反人民，而是为了为人民服务”。
    在讨论作家和职业问题的委员会会议上，苏联代表西蒙诺夫在发言中说，这个问题是与作家和读者之间的关系密切联系在一起的。
    印度的发言人们一再提及缺少发表他们的著作以及把这些著作贡献给读者的机会。
    26日晚，参加亚洲作家会议的印度代表团举行了茶会，招待其他作家的代表和观察员。
