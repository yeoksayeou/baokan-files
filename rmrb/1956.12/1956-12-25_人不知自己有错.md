People don't know their own mistakes,
The camel doesn't realize it's holding its head high.
A learned person is like a fruit tree,
	--bent and winding;
A foolish person is like a bamboo pole,
	--smooth and sharp.
People easily stumble on sweet words,
Horses often trip on soft ground.

    人不知自己有错
    （蒙古谚语）
    人不知自己有错，
    骆驼不觉自己仰脖。
    有学问的人像果树，
    ——纽纽弯弯；
    愚蠢的人像竹竿，
    ——滑滑尖尖
    人在甜言上易栽跟头，
    马在软地上常打前失。
          郝苏民辑译
