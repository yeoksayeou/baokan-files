    “Gathering Friends Through Literature”
    ——A Record of the Asian Writers Conference
    Ye Shengtao, Member of the Chinese Delegation to the Asian Writers Conference
    Writers from many countries gathering together for a conference, just like the ancient Chinese saying "gathering friends through literature," this had never happened before. This Asian Writers Conference is the first of its kind in history.
    Many people in reports or speeches said that the convening of the Asian Writers Conference, aside from anything else, has extremely significant meaning in itself. This is something everyone feels, so it is said in unison.
    Fifteen Asian countries sent representatives. What is the total population of these fifteen countries? 1.2 billion. The representatives' skin color, language, views, and beliefs are all different, but they have one thing in common: they are all happy to learn from each other and refine their minds and hands, so as to better convey the voice of their compatriots—their joys, sorrows, and hopes.
    Not only that. Europe, Australia, North America, and South America all had observers participating in this conference (the Asian republics of the Soviet Union sent representatives, while the European part sent observers; Simonov was one of the observers). Although it is called the Asian Writers Conference, the scope of "gathering friends through literature" is not limited to Asia. When writers meet, their languages may not be mutually intelligible, and sometimes even a single translation is not enough, requiring two translations. However, they all feel very close to each other, as if they have met old friends. One says he writes novels, another says he writes plays, or one says he writes poetry, another says he also writes poetry. At this time, the sense of solemnity and responsibility towards work is concentrated on the same focus, and their hearts are united together. The unity of writers will inevitably strengthen the unity of the people. Isn't the significance important?
    At the conference, people often mentioned the phrase "the awakening of Asia," which can explain why there is no writers' conference in other continents, but first there is this Asian Writers Conference. For centuries, many nations and countries in Asia have suffered the same fate, suppressed by foreign forces. Now, everyone has gotten rid of this suppression. In our commonly used words, everyone has stood up. The so-called awakening does not mean that they have been obsessed and unconscious before; it is more appropriate to regard it as synonymous with standing up. If they were truly obsessed and unconscious before, how could they suddenly all stand up? Having stood up, everything needs to be managed, and literature is one of them. The "management" here is not only about sorting things out, but more importantly, about letting it flourish. Literature was once a factor in standing up, and in order to stand stably and strongly in the future, this factor is especially needed. Everyone holds the desire to let literature flourish, so naturally they feel that "gathering friends through literature" is a very crucial thing.
    At the conference, representatives from various countries reported on the current situation of literature in their own countries or in their own languages. In addition, there were four special topics—Asian traditions, writers and freedom, writers and their careers, and cultural exchange—which were discussed by representatives divided into four groups. Since the purpose of the conference is to "gather friends through literature," it is necessary to talk about the current situation of literature. In the past, due to language barriers and various artificial obstacles, people did not understand each other. Now, when they talk about it, the listeners feel fresh and increase their knowledge. An Indian representative who speaks one language talks about the literature of that language, and other Indian representatives who speak other languages also say they have never heard of it. Of course, there are more such situations between this country and that country. Only after mutual understanding can we talk about learning from each other and absorbing each other's strengths. The cultural exchange item in the special topics is also for the purpose of enhancing mutual understanding and achieving mutual absorption.
    It is very easy to understand why this conference talked about Asian traditions. Having stood up, of course, we must evaluate our own family property to see how much value it has and how much it will play a role in the new life in the future. Someone used a metaphor, saying that in the past our windows only opened to the West, and now we must also open to the East. Opening windows to the East means paying attention to Asian traditions. Some people also talked about the idea of ​​overcorrection, thinking that windows should only be opened to the East, and that all our Asian traditions are treasures, and we must completely restore those traditions. This kind of "melancholy for the past" should be understood by people, but it is not practical. The view of the majority of people is that we know how to cherish Asian traditions, and we want to promote and carry forward its essence, and let it combine with the new life. The attitude towards Western traditions is the same. In short, we must not let tradition become something that restricts us. In order to create a better new life, we must absorb nutrients from various traditions.
    Freedom and writers, this is a topic that everyone is very concerned about. Do writers have freedom? Why is writing for writers freedom, and why is writing not freedom? How should writers strive for freedom, and what kind of freedom should they strive for? Because the understanding of freedom is not consistent, everyone has their own views on these issues. This is of course. But I have a premonition here that after the writers have more contact and increase their understanding of each other, even if they don't come up with any common program or common principles, they will naturally embark on roughly the same path. What kind of road is it? It is to strive to create with the people's life as the source, and truthfully write about the people's joys, sorrows, and hopes. Writers are one of the people. As long as they breathe with the people, their own voice is also the voice of the people, and writing about the people is also writing about themselves. Isn't this a great freedom? At the same time, they will deeply feel that if they stick to any traditions, dogmas, or purely formal things, that is extreme unfreedom, because it has little or no relationship with the people's lives.
    How did I have the premonition I mentioned earlier? I got that premonition from the fact that everyone gathered together for a meeting. "Gathering friends through literature," preserving differences and seeking common ground, will inevitably lead to the path I mentioned.
    This article is just a brief narration and personal feelings. The conclusions of the conference discussions will be reported on at a later date. (New Delhi, December 26)

    “以文会友”
    ——记亚洲作家会议
    出席亚洲作家会议中国代表团团员　叶圣陶
    许多国家的作家聚在一块儿开会，正像我国古话所说的“以文会友”，这种事从来不曾有过，这回亚洲作家会议是历史上头一回。
    好些人在报告或是发言里都说，亚洲作家会议召开，不说别的，这件事本身就有极重大的意义。这是人人都感觉到的，所以说出来不约而同。
    派出代表的是亚洲十五个国家。这十五个国家共有多少人口呢？一十二亿。代表们的肤色、语言、见解、信仰各各不同，可有个共同之点，他们都乐于跟到会的朋友切磋琢磨，使自己的心和手更为高妙，更能传达出同胞的心声——他们的欢乐、哀愁和愿望。
    不仅如此。欧洲、澳洲、北美、南美也都有观察员参加这个会议（苏联亚洲部分的共和国派出代表，欧洲部分就派观察员，西蒙诺夫是观察员之一）。虽说是亚洲作家会议，“以文会友”的范围可不限于亚洲。作家们见了面，语言未必相通，有时一道翻译不济事，要翻两道，然而彼此都感觉非常亲切，像遇见了老朋友。一个说他写小说，另一个说他写戏剧，或者一个说他写诗，另一个说他也写诗，这时候，对工作的庄严感和责任感集中在同一焦点，彼此的心团结在一起了。作家们的团结必然加强人民的团结，意义岂不重大？
    会议里又常有人提起“亚洲的觉醒”的话，这可以说明为什么没有别洲的作家会议而首先有这个亚洲作家会议。几世纪以来，亚洲的许多民族许多国家遭到相同的命运，让外来的势力压制住了。到现在，大家都摆脱了这种压制，用我国习用的话说，就是大家站起来了。所谓觉醒，不是说以前一直沉迷不醒，要把它认作站起来的同义词才恰当。要是以前真个沉迷不醒，怎么忽然间都会站起来呢？站起来了，百端待理，其中就有文学一项。这儿说的“理”不仅是整理，更重要的是让它发荣滋长。文学曾经是站起来的一种因素，今后要站得稳定，站得坚强，尤其需要这种因素。大家抱着让文学发荣滋长的愿望，自然感觉“以文会友”是非常切要的事了。
    在会议里，各国代表都报告他国内或是他那种语言的文学的现况。此外是四个专题——亚洲的传统，作家和自由，作家和他的事业，文化交流，由代表们分成四个小组讨论。会议的目的既然在“以文会友”，各自谈谈文学的现况是必要的。过去由于语言隔阂和人为的种种阻障，彼此不相了解。现在谈出来，听的人都觉得新鲜，增长了知识。一种语言的印度代表谈他那种语言的文学，别种语言的印度代表也有说是闻所未闻的。在这一国和那一国之间，当然更有这样的情形。互相了解之后，才能够谈到切磋琢磨，互学所长。专题里边有文化交流一项，也是为的增进互相了解，达到互相吸收。
    这个会议里谈到亚洲的传统，是极容易理解的。站起来了，当然要估计估计自己的家业，看它的价值有多大，它对于今后的新生活将起多少作用。有人用比喻的说法说道，以往我们的窗户光朝西方开，现在也得朝东方开。朝东方开窗户，就是注重亚洲的传统的意思。矫枉过正的想法也有人谈出来，以为窗户就只要朝东方开，我们亚洲的传统全都是宝贝，必须完全恢复那些传统才行。这种“思古之幽情”应该得到人家的谅解，然而并不切合实际。多数人的见解是，我们懂得珍爱亚洲的传统，它的精华的部分，我们要把它发扬光大，让它跟新生活结合起来。对于西方的传统，也就是这么个态度。总而言之，不能让传统成为拘束我们的东西，我们为要创造更好的新生活，所以要从各种传统里吸取养料。
    自由和作家，这是大家非常关切的一个题目。作家有没有自由？作家为什么而写作才是自由，为什么而写作就是不自由？作家该怎么样争取自由，该争取什么样的自由？由于对自由的认识并不一致，大家对这些问题各有各的看法。这是当然的。可是我在这儿有一种预感，作家们多多接触，彼此增进了解以后，也不必定出什么共同纲领或是共同原则，自然而然会走上大致相同的道路。什么样的道路呢？就是创作务求以人民的生活为源泉，真实地写出人民的欢乐、哀愁和愿望。作家本是人民中间的一个，只要他跟人民同其呼吸，自己的心声也就是人民的心声，写出人民的也就是写出自己的，这岂不是极大的自由？同时他将深切地感觉到，如果拘守什么传统、教条或是纯粹的形式，那就是极度的不自由，因为这跟人民的生活不大有关系或者毫无关系。
    我怎么会有前边说的那种预感呢？我从大家聚在一块儿开会这件事上得到那种预感。“以文会友”，存其异而求其同，势所必至会同在我所说的那条道路上。
    这一篇只是简略的叙述和个人的感想。会议讨论的结论，缓日再来报道。（12月26日新德里）
