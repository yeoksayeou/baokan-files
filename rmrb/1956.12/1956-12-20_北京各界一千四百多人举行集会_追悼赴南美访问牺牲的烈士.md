Xinhua News Agency, December 19th. This morning, as dawn broke, a hearse carrying the ashes of the ten martyrs of the Chinese Art Troupe who sacrificed their lives during their visit to South America and on their way home, slowly departed from the Jiarui Temple in the northern part of Beijing and moved to the People's Theater in the western part of the city.
    More than 1,400 representatives from all circles in Beijing held a gathering at the People's Theater to mourn them.
    Hanging in the center of the venue were the portraits of the ten martyrs: Li Dechun, Yu Liang, Deng Ziruo, Rao Qifeng, Zhang Huaigen, Wu Mingshen, Liu Youchun, Zhang Chunlai, Wang Wenhua, and Jiang Wenlin.
    Wreaths presented by the State Council, Premier Zhou Enlai, various democratic parties, mass organizations, cultural departments, and famous figures in the literary and art circles were placed before the spirits of the martyrs. A touching couplet hung in the venue: "They unfortunately died on the road of friendship between the people, and their heroic names will forever be immortalized in the flowers of world peace."
    Amidst the strains of mourning music, Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of Culture, who presided over the memorial service, announced the start of the memorial meeting.
    Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of Culture and the principal officiant, read the memorial oration. The memorial oration stated: In recent years, outstanding representatives of China's cultural and artistic circles have actively participated in international affairs and carried out extensive cultural exchanges and friendly activities. They have played a significant role in enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the people of other countries. This time, the Chinese Art Troupe, as cultural envoys of the Chinese people to the people of Latin America, visited four countries: Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina, attracting audiences of 150,000 in theaters and over one million on television. The people of Latin America welcomed the Chinese artists with a festive mood, thus initially opening up a situation where there had been a lack of mutual exchange in the past. The enormous success of the art troupe's visit to South America is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Party and the government, the efforts of all members of the troupe, and the hard work of the deceased martyrs. The martyrs are good examples for Chinese art workers, and their contributions will not only be recorded in the annals of our country's cultural work, but will also forever live in the hearts of art workers throughout the country. Our country's position and influence in international affairs are increasing day by day, and the international situation requires us to work harder to develop cultural exchanges and friendly activities between countries to strive for the easing of international tensions and consolidate lasting peace.
    The memorial oration concluded: Martyrs! Your contributions to the peaceful construction of the motherland and the cause of world peace are great, your sacrifice is glorious, and we will definitely shoulder your unfinished aspirations and cause with all our strength, and commemorate you with even greater achievements. Rest in peace, glorious martyrs!
    Qian Junrui also extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs on behalf of the Ministry of Culture and art workers across the country.
    Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and head of the Chinese Art Troupe that visited South America, delivered a eulogy at the meeting.
    Zhao Feng, the deputy head of the Chinese Art Troupe that visited South America, introduced the life stories of the ten martyrs and their contributions to the revolutionary cause, and announced: The Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of the Ministry of Culture has posthumously recognized Zhang Huaigen, Wu Mingshen, Zhang Chunlai, Wang Wenhua, and Jiang Wenlin, who had applied to join the Party before their deaths, as members of the Chinese Communist Party, and approved the advancement of Comrade Liu Youchun, a probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party, to full membership ahead of schedule.
    The Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Gregor, presented a wreath to the martyrs' portraits and expressed his condolences to Qian Junrui.
    As the orchestra played mourning music once again, Zhang Zhixiang, Chu Tunan, Zhao Yimin, Luo Qingchang, Tang Mingzhao, Chen Zhongjing, Zhao Feng, Wang Li, Li Shaochun, Zhang Yunxi and others carried the ashes of the ten martyrs onto the hearse to be buried in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.
    After the deaths of these ten martyrs, the relevant departments and our embassy in Switzerland received more than 150 condolence messages from people from all walks of life, cultural organizations, artists, and people from all walks of life in Argentina, Switzerland, the German Democratic Republic, Indonesia, France, Italy, Japan, and other countries, as well as from all walks of life in China. These telegrams all expressed deep condolences and extended sympathy to the families of the martyrs.

    北京各界一千四百多人举行集会
    追悼赴南美访问牺牲的烈士
    新华社19日讯　今日清早，天色微明，安放着赴南美访问、在归国途中牺牲的中国艺术团十位烈士骨灰的一辆灵车，缓缓从北京北城嘉兴寺出发，移到西城人民剧场。
    北京各界代表一千四百多人在人民剧场举行集会悼念他们。
    会场正中悬挂着李德椿、俞良、邓子若、饶其丰、张槐根、吴鸣申、刘又春、张春来、王文华、蒋文林十位烈士的遗像。
    国务院、周恩来总理、各民主党派、各群众团体、文化部门、著名文艺界人士献的花圈放满在烈士灵前。会场上还挂着一付感人的挽联：“人民友谊道路上不幸遇难，世界和平花丛里英名永垂”。
    在哀乐声中，追悼会主持人、文化部副部长张致祥宣布追悼大会开始。
    主祭人、文化部代理部长钱俊瑞宣读祭文。祭文中说：几年来中国文化艺术界的优秀代表们积极参与了国际事务的活动，开展了广泛的文化交流工作和友好活动。对于增进中国人民和各国人民之间的相互了解和友谊起了重大的作用。这次中国艺术团作为中国人民对于拉丁美洲的人民的文化友好使节访问了智利、乌拉圭、巴西、阿根廷四个国家，拥有剧场观众十五万人，电视观众一百万人以上。拉丁美洲人民以一种节日的心情欢迎了中国的艺术家们，因此初步打开了过去缺乏相互交往的局面。访问南美的艺术团取得如此巨大的成绩是同党和政府的正确领导、全团人员的努力分不开的，也是和死难烈士们的辛勤工作分不开的。烈士们都是中国艺术工作者的好榜样，他们的劳绩，不仅将被载入我国文化工作的史册，也将永远活在全国艺术工作者的心里。我国在国际事务中的地位和影响正在日益提高，国际形势要求我们更加努力发展各国间的文化交流和友好活动，来争取国际紧张局势的缓和，巩固持久和平。
    祭文最后说：烈士们！你们为了祖国的和平建设和世界和平事业所作的贡献是伟大的，你们的牺牲是光荣的，你们的未竟志愿和事业我们一定用全力担当起来，用更大的成就来纪念你们。光荣的烈士们安息吧！
    钱俊瑞并且代表文化部和全国文艺工作者向烈士家属致衷心的慰问。
    中国人民对外文化协会会长、赴南美访问的中国艺术团团长楚图南在会上致悼词。
    赴南美访问的中国艺术团副团长赵沨介绍了十位烈士的生平事迹和他们对革命事业的贡献，并且宣布：中共文化部委员会已追认生前申请入党的张槐根、吴鸣申、张春来、王文华、蒋文林等五位同志为中共党员，批准中共预备党员刘又春同志提前转为正式党员。
    捷克斯洛伐克驻华大使格里哥尔向烈士遗像献了花圈，并且向钱俊瑞表示哀悼之意。
    当乐队再一次奏起哀乐的时候，张致祥、楚图南、赵毅敏、罗青长、唐明照、陈忠经、赵沨、王力、李少春、张云溪等十人捧起十位烈士的骨灰送上灵车，到八宝山革命烈士公墓安葬。
    这十位烈士遇难以后，有关单位和我国驻瑞士大使馆共收到阿根廷、瑞士、德意志民主共和国、印度尼西亚、法国、意大利、日本等国家的各界人士、文化团体、艺术家以及国内各界人士拍来唁电一百五十多件。这些电报都表示沉痛的哀悼，并且向烈士家属表示慰问。
