Xinhua News Agency, London, December 20th. The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party held a meeting on December 15th and 16th, at which it passed a statement on the Hungarian event.

    This statement reiterates support for the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and considers the dispatch of Soviet troops to be necessary.

    Reviewing the Hungarian event from the perspective of the international situation, the statement points out: "A powerful force within the Western imperialist camp, fearing the prospect of peaceful coexistence and the advance towards socialism and national liberation, is attempting to strengthen the Cold War and implement a dangerous policy of aggression."

    Analyzing the background of the Hungarian event, the statement points out that Fascism ruled Hungary for twenty-five years, from 1919 to 1944. What overthrew Hungarian Fascism in 1944 was the military victory of the Soviet army, not the internal strength of the Hungarian people. Despite these difficulties, the Hungarian People's Democratic Republic still achieved many great positive accomplishments. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the foundation for socialism was laid.

    The statement points out that in recent years, serious errors and abuses of power occurred under the leadership of Rakosi and Gerő. These errors include: shortcomings in the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Hungarian People's Democratic Republic; going too far in achieving industrialization without adequately considering Hungary's specific conditions, nor paying sufficient attention to improving living standards, thus committing economic errors; political errors included concentrating power in the hands of a small clique, abandoning democratic methods of leadership, and the emergence of bureaucratic tendencies and criminally abusing power in the activities of state institutions and in the power and working methods of the police and security police.

    "All these developments in recent years have served to damage the prestige of the regime and aroused justifiable discontent among the people."

    The statement then discussed in detail the disintegration of the Hungarian Working People's Party. It pointed out that this party, formed from the merger of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, had a majority of members without experience in fighting Fascism, the composition of the members was impure, and the party's political education to improve the political level of its members was also insufficient.

    Certain elements within the party, especially those associated with Nagy, incited the people against the party, encouraged ideas that shook the foundations of the party and the regime, and reflected nationalism and bourgeois liberalism, as well as anti-Soviet sentiment. "This opened the way for the infiltration of organized counter-revolutionary forces."

    After detailing the tragic events in Hungary, the statement said: "The actions of the Soviet army were entirely to counter the attempt by Western-backed counter-revolutionaries to seize power. Therefore, this was not against Hungary's independence, but to maintain Hungary's independence from imperialist rule. This was not an attempt to impose socialism by force, but to prevent Western-backed counter-revolutionaries from destroying the socialist achievements of the Hungarian people, so that the Hungarian people could resume their socialist progress. At the same time, the Soviet action also defended the socialist achievements of the neighboring people's democratic countries."

    The statement said that as a result of recent events, the Hungarian government and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party are facing enormous problems and difficulties.

    "However, the Kadar government has not taken the path of surrendering to the reactionaries like the Nagy government did. It is firmly and decisively dealing with the problem of eradicating counter-revolutionaries, while striving to win over all honest working people, making them understand the need for a tremendous united effort to build socialism.

    "We must also not ignore that the most reactionary elements of Western imperialism are striving to organize a frenzied anti-socialist, anti-communist, and anti-Soviet movement over the Hungarian question, and abuse the United Nations machinery to achieve this goal.

    "Therefore, there is an urgent need for the entire working class, anti-fascist fighters, and supporters of peace in all countries to actively unite against the new offensive launched by fascism in Europe.

    "It is necessary to use all the strength of the labor movement and the peace movement to prevent the resurgence of the Cold War, which reactionary forces are trying to revive in order to launch further attacks on the Hungarian people and prepare for an anti-Soviet war."

    The statement advocates the conclusion of a European security treaty, which can be joined by the governments of European countries in any form, to replace the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty, thereby making it possible to withdraw all foreign troops from Western and Eastern Europe.

### 英共执委会通过关于匈牙利事件的声明

    英共执委会通过关于匈牙利事件的声明
    重申支持匈牙利工农革命政府。认为苏军的行动是为了维持匈牙利的独立，并保卫了各人民民主国家的社会主义成就。号召各国人民团结起来反对法西斯主义在欧洲发动的新攻势。
    新华社伦敦20日电　英国共产党执行委员会在12月15日和16日举行了会议，会上通过了关于匈牙利事件的声明。
    这项声明重申支持匈牙利工农革命政府，并且认为苏联军队的出动是必要的。
    声明在从国际局势的角度回顾匈牙利的事件时指出：“西方帝国主义阵营中有一股强大的力量由于害怕和平共处的前景以及害怕向着社会主义和民族解放的前进，试图加强冷战，并且实行了危险的侵略政策。”
    声明在分析匈牙利事件的背景的时候指出，法西斯主义从1919年到1944年在匈牙利统治了二十五年。1944年把匈牙利的法西斯主义推翻的是苏联军队的军事胜利，而不是匈牙利人民的内部力量。尽管有这些困难，但是，匈牙利人民民主国家仍旧获得了许多巨大的积极成就。在苏联的援助下，奠定了社会主义的基础。
    声明指出，在近几年中，在拉科西和格罗的领导下发生了严重的错误和滥用职权的行为。这些错误包括：在苏联和匈牙利人民民主国家之间的关系上存在着缺点；在实现工业化方面搞得太过火，而没有适当地考虑到匈牙利的具体条件，也没有足够地注意到改善生活水平，因而犯了经济上的错误；政治上的错误是把权力集中在一个小集团的手中，放弃了民主的领导方法，在国家机构的活动中以及在警察和保安警察的势力上和工作方法上发生了官僚主义倾向和罪恶地滥用职权的现象。
    “这一切的发展在最近几年中都起了损害这一政权的威望的作用，并且在人民中间引起了理所当然的不满情绪。”
    声明接着详细谈到了匈牙利劳动人民党的瓦解。它指出，这个党是由共产党和社会民主党合成的，它的大多数党员没有对法西斯主义进行斗争的经验，党员的成分不纯，党在为提高党员的政治水平而进行的政治教育也不够。
    党内的某些分子，特别是和纳吉有联系的那些人，煽动人民反对党，鼓励那种使党和政权的基础动摇、并且反映民族主义和资产阶级自由主义以及反苏情绪的思想。“这就为有组织的反革命势力的渗入开了路。”
    声明在详细叙述了匈牙利的悲惨事件以后说：“苏联军队的行动完全是为了对付西方支持的反革命夺取政权的企图。因此，这并不是反对匈牙利的独立，而是为了维持匈牙利的独立以免受帝国主义的统治。这不是设法强行社会主义，而是阻止西方支持的反革命来摧毁匈牙利人民的社会主义成果，从而使匈牙利人民能够恢复他们的社会主义的进展。同时，苏联的行动还保卫了邻近的人民民主国家的社会主义成就。”
    声明说，由于最近的事件的结果，匈牙利政府和匈牙利社会主义工人党面临着巨大的问题和困难。
    “但是，卡达尔政府并没有像纳吉政府那样采取向反动派投降的道路。它坚定而果断地处理根除反革命分子的问题，同时努力争取所有诚实的劳动人民，使他们了解需要进行巨大的团结一致的努力来建设社会主义。
    “我们也绝不能忽视西方帝国主义中最反动的阶层正在努力要在匈牙利问题上组织疯狂的反社会主义、反共和反苏的运动以及滥用联合国机器来达到这个目的。
      “因此，迫切需要各国全体工人阶级、反法西斯的战士和支持和平的人积极团结来反对法西斯主义在欧洲发动的新攻势。
      “有必要利用劳工运动和和平运动的一切力量来防止冷战的再起，反动势力正在试图恢复冷战，以便进一步向匈牙利人民发动进攻，并且为反苏战争作好准备。”
    声明主张缔结一项不论任何形式的欧洲国家政府都可以参加的欧洲安全条约，来代替北大西洋公约和华沙条约，从而使得有可能从西欧和东欧撤退所有的外国驻军。
