Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, December 1st: The Polish News Agency reported that Władysław Gomułka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, delivered a speech on November 29th at the All-Poland Conference of Social and Political Activists held in Warsaw.

Gomułka said that the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party are a broad program of revival, and these resolutions require years of conscious and patient work by the people of the whole country to achieve.

Gomułka then spoke about Polish-Soviet relations. He said that the Polish people are particularly sensitive about their sovereignty. In the post-war Polish-Soviet relations, many aspects aroused dissatisfaction among the Polish people. These included the delayed repatriation of Polish citizens from the Soviet Union, the lack of explicit regulations regarding the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Poland, and the issue of coal, among others. Hostile propaganda spread the notion that the Soviet Union was responsible for all the errors and faults in Polish life in the past. Gomułka said that our enemies see the elimination of all abnormal phenomena in our relations with the Soviet Union as bad news because, as a result, they lose the basis for their propaganda.

	The Polish-Soviet Declaration is a Political Victory for Both Sides

Referring to the frequently raised claim abroad that the Moscow talks and their results were a one-sided victory for Polish policy, Gomułka said that the Polish-Soviet declaration signed in Moscow was a political victory for both sides.

Gomułka then spoke about the Soviet Union's agreement to Poland's demands regarding past coal prices. He pointed out that in the years between the two world wars, foreign capital made huge profits by exploiting Poland, but it is difficult to imagine the government of a capitalist country agreeing to return these funds. Gomułka said that in addition to agreeing to the coal price demands, the Soviet government also agreed to adjust the issue of its use of railway transportation at low prices. The payment for transportation equipment used by Soviet troops on Polish territory will also be resolved. The Soviet government also agreed to cancel approximately 110 million rubles of the so-called old war material loan concluded in 1947. On this point, the speaker traced Poland's old war material loan from the United States, totaling 38 million US dollars. The cars and other equipment purchased from the old war materials of the US military have long been worn out, and Poland still pays the United States 1.3 million US dollars in principal and approximately 700,000 US dollars in interest every year in zlotys.

Referring to the argument that Poland is supposedly unwilling to accept aid from Western countries, Gomułka recalled that the Party and the government had long expressed their opinions on this issue. He cited examples of loans that Poland signed with capitalist countries during the interwar period, which were economically unfavorable to Poland and detrimental to Polish sovereignty.

	Soviet Troops Stationed in Poland are a Guarantee of Poland's Western Border

Regarding the temporary stationing of Soviet troops in Poland, Gomułka emphasized that this is a guarantee of Poland's western border.

Gomułka spoke about the events that occurred in Hungary, which have been used to launch fierce attacks against the Soviet Union. He believes that the use of Soviet troops in Hungary at the request of the Hungarian government is different in nature from the events that occurred in Egypt. He said that the aggression against Egypt was aimed at Egypt's sovereignty and was also a manifestation of bankrupt colonialism. Those who loudly oppose the Hungarian events are those who base their policies on external interference—but from another direction. These people incited the Hungarian people and bear a great responsibility for the bloodshed that occurred there.

Gomułka said that the results of the Polish-Soviet talks in Moscow can serve as an example of the kind of relationship that should exist between socialist countries. He said that we believe that Soviet-Hungarian relations will also be established on the same principles.

Gomułka said that the foundation of Poland's sovereignty is its solidarity with the socialist camp. The relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union should be based on equality, territorial integrity, independence, sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.

	Poland Will Strengthen Friendly Relations with Fraternal Countries

Gomułka emphasized that increasingly friendly mutual relations and increasingly deep understanding connect us with the People's Republic of China—our tested friend. Our relations with Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and other countries in the socialist camp are marked by common interests and friendship. We will continue to strengthen this relationship.

The clarification of some issues and the complete normalization of relations with Yugoslavia have also recently begun.

Gomułka continued by saying that not all communist parties have given appropriate and correct evaluations of the recent events in Poland. However, the development of these events will undoubtedly clarify all disputed issues.

He said that Poland's relations with all countries should primarily be marked by efforts to ensure peace. We will spare no effort to establish economic and cultural relations with all countries willing to establish the best possible relations with us. We are prepared to discuss some political issues based on the principles of coexistence, seeking a common path of reconciliation on some contentious issues.

Gomułka turned to domestic affairs, paying close attention to issues related to the democratization of Polish life and economic tasks.

Gomułka pointed out that the criticism of the mistakes made by the Polish United Workers' Party was first put forward by the Party itself. He said that this gives people the right to ask those who are attacking the entire Party why they have not shown the kind of courage that the Polish United Workers' Party has demonstrated. Gomułka emphasized that the policy mistakes of the Polish United Workers' Party should not obscure its great achievements. Despite the mistakes made in the economic field, the prospects for Poland's economic development are bright and satisfactory.

	Don't Even Think About the Restoration of Capitalism in Poland

Gomułka then condemned those who believe that the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session are a stage for Poland to return to capitalism, arguing that the hopes of bourgeois politicians for such a "stage" should be dispelled. He said that a ruthless struggle must be waged against provocateurs and scoundrels.

Gomułka pointed out that now certain groups are attacking those Party leaders who have always worked diligently in the past and who now fully support and implement the plans of the Eighth Plenary Session. He said that honest and faithful people must not be slandered.

Gomułka emphasized: "The Party does not intend to prevent those past opposition members from participating in the work of democratizing Poland's political, social, and economic life, provided they no longer adhere to their past views. Those who do not agree with our action program should be asked the following question: What is your program? Negating everything and not thinking cannot be considered a program."

	There is No Freedom for Bourgeois Political Parties to Operate in Poland

Gomułka said, "Whoever has a different, better, and more realistic program should present it to the people. Politicians without a program tell us that our program does not give freedom to all political parties. We must answer them that there is no freedom for bourgeois political parties to operate in our country.

Gomułka said that members of various political parties and social organizations who have not been active in the past are now beginning to express their opinions and elect people they trust to their central bodies. In this case, the role played by political parties and social organizations in Polish life has new significance. One manifestation of this is the establishment of the Central Consultative Committee and similar committees at the local level. These institutions are permanent consultative bodies that will shape the political life of the country and strive to achieve a common program of socialist construction.

Gomułka emphasized, "It is essential for Poland to take the socialist road and cooperate with non-Marxist parties that support the Party's program, which is in line with the wishes of these parties. It is also possible for the Catholic progressive movement to participate in Polish-style socialism because favorable conditions have already been created for this. Cardinal Wyszyński has resumed church work. We want to resolve all outstanding issues, which are issues discussed in talks between government representatives and church representatives. We want to eliminate all obstacles on the road to full cooperation. We believe that clergy at all levels and all priests, with freedom of action, will support our program for the benefit of the people and the country.

He continued, the scale of Poland's democratization can be gradually expanded as long as the bourgeoisie and reactionary forces do not take advantage of it. Peace, order, and cooperation among political parties and all organized groups in socialist construction will be conducive to the expansion of socialist democracy in Poland.

	The Urgent Task is to Strengthen Industrial and Agricultural Production

Gomułka said that we are establishing a socialist system without those past biases. We are creating conditions for workers to become managers of their own enterprises. We give farmers the freedom to choose this or that form of cultivation, although we believe that collective farms are a superior form. We will give assistance and support to various forms of agricultural cooperatives. In our environment, intellectuals have full possibilities for creative development. We are promoting the development of handicrafts. Our most urgent task at present is to steadily increase industrial and agricultural production. Such a policy is now expected by the Polish people.

Gomułka emphasized that Poland's socialist form is being shaped by the people themselves and adapted to the present environment.

	Only a Socialist Poland Can Be Free and Independent

He said, "Only a socialist Poland can be a free and independent Poland. Such a Poland can become increasingly strong, guaranteeing employment and improving the living conditions of the people. The working masses of our country will not allow any other kind of Poland."

Gomułka continued: My words should be regarded as an election speech by a candidate of our Party. The election program of the Polish United Workers' Party is included in the common declaration of the National Unity Front. Our Party will participate in the election together with other political parties and social organizations, putting forward a common election list. News of the nomination of many parliamentary candidates has already come from all parts of the country. There are cases where even hundreds of candidates are being nominated in some areas where only a few parliamentarians can be elected. Poland will always have enough candidates, but the task facing the people of the whole country now is to elect the most mature people. "When electing candidates, it is necessary to consider: How they have fulfilled their civic obligations so far, and how they have selflessly worked for the interests of the motherland. The Polish United Workers' Party will keep this in mind when nominating its candidates."

    哥穆尔卡在全波积极分子大会上发表演说
　　波兰将坚决走社会主义的道路
    新华社华沙1日电　波兰通讯社报道，波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡11月29日在华沙举行的全波社会和政治积极分子会议上发表了演说。
    哥穆尔卡说，波兰统一工人党中央委员会第八次全体会议的决议是一个广泛的复兴纲领，这些决议需要全国人民几年的自觉和耐心的工作才能实现。
    哥穆尔卡接着谈到关于波苏关系。他说，波兰全国人民对于他们的主权是格外敏感的。在战后的波苏关系上，有许多方面引起了波兰人的不满。其中包括迟迟不从苏联遣返波兰公民问题、对暂驻波兰的苏联军队缺乏明文规章问题、煤的问题等。敌对的宣传散播一种说法，说苏联要对过去时期波兰生活中的全部错误和过失负责。哥穆尔卡说，我们的敌人们把消除了我们同苏联关系中的一切不正常现象这个事实看作是个坏消息。因为由于这样，他们就丧失了进行宣传的依据。
      波苏声明是双方政治上的胜利
    在谈到国外经常提出的关于莫斯科会谈及其结果是单方面的波兰政策的胜利这一说法时，哥穆尔卡说，在莫斯科签署的波苏声明是双方的政治上的胜利。
    哥穆尔卡接着谈到苏联同意波兰对过去时期煤价要求的事。他指出，在两次大战之间的年代中，外国资本靠剥削波兰获得巨额利润，但是很难设想资本主义国家政府会同意归还这些款子的。哥穆尔卡说，除了同意煤斤方面的要求外，苏联政府还同意调整它以低价利用铁路运输的问题。波兰领土上的苏联军队使用的交通设备的支付问题也将解决。苏联政府还同意取消1947年缔结的所谓旧的战争物资贷款的大约一亿一千万卢布。发言者就这一点追溯波兰从美国得到共计三千八百万美元的旧的战争物资贷款。从美国军队的旧的战争物资中购买的汽车和其他装备早就耗损了，而波兰每年还在以兹罗提付给美国一百三十万美元的本金和大约七十万美元的利息。
    在提到有人坚决认为波兰据说不愿意接受西方国家的援助这种议论时，哥穆尔卡追溯说，党和政府早已表示了它们对这个问题的意见。他举了两次世界大战之间的年代中波兰同资本主义国家签订了在经济上对波兰不利并且有损波兰主权的贷款的一些例子。
      苏联驻军是波兰西部边境的保证
    在谈到苏联军队暂时驻扎波兰问题时，哥穆尔卡强调说，这是波兰西部边境的一个保证。
    哥穆尔卡谈到匈牙利发生的事件，这些事件已被利用来对苏联进行激烈的攻击。他认为，按照匈牙利政府的愿望在匈牙利使用苏联军队，在性质上是和在埃及发生的事件不相同的。他说，因为对埃及的侵略，其目的是针对埃及的主权，同时也是破了产的殖民主义政策的一种表现。那些大声疾呼反对匈牙利事件的人就是那些以进行外部干涉——但是从另一方面——为其政策基础的人。这些人煽动匈牙利国民，并且要对那里所发生的流血事件负很大的责任。
    哥穆尔卡说，莫斯科的波苏会谈的结果可以作为社会主义国家之间应当存在的那种性质的关系的榜样。他说，我们相信，苏匈关系也将在同样的原则上建立起来。
    哥穆尔卡说，波兰主权的基础是它和社会主义阵营的团结。波兰和苏联的关系应该建立在双方平等、领土的完整、独立、主权和互不干涉内政的基础上。
    波兰将加强同兄弟国家的友好关系
    哥穆尔卡强调指出，愈来愈友好的相互关系和愈来愈深刻的了解把我们同中华人民共和国——我们的受过考验的朋友——联系起来。我们同捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国和社会主义阵营其它国家的关系是以共同的利益和友谊为标志的。我们将继续不断地加强这种关系。
    一些问题的澄清以及同南斯拉夫关系的完全正常化最近也已经开始。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，不是所有共产党都对最近在波兰发生的事件给予适当和正确的评价的。但是，这些事件的发展无疑将澄清所有争论的问题。
    他说，波兰和所有国家的关系首先应该以保证和平的努力为标志。我们将不惜作一切努力来和所有愿意同我们建立最良好的关系的国家建立经济和文化关系。我们准备根据共处的原则讨论一些政治问题，寻求在一些争端问题上修好的共同的道路。
    哥穆尔卡转而谈到国内事务，他非常注意与波兰生活的民主化有关的问题和经济任务。
    哥穆尔卡指出，对波兰统一工人党所犯的错误的批评是由党自己首先提出的。他说，这使人有权利问那些正在攻击整个党的人们为什么他们没有像波兰统一工人党所表现的那种勇气。哥穆尔卡强调指出，波兰统一工人党在政策方面的错误不应当掩蔽它的巨大成就。尽管在经济方面犯了错误，波兰经济发展的前景是美好的和令人满意的。
        休想资本主义在波兰复辟
    哥穆尔卡然后谴责那些认为第八次全体会议的决议是波兰回到资本主义的一个阶段的人，他认为，资产阶级政客们对这样一个“阶段”所抱的希望应该打消。他说，对那些挑衅分子和无赖分子要进行无情的斗争。
    哥穆尔卡指出：现在某些集团对那些过去一贯勤勤恳恳地工作、现在完全支持并且推行八中全会的计划的党的领袖们也进行攻击。他说，不准污蔑正直和忠实的人。
    哥穆尔卡强调说：“党不打算阻止那些过去的反对派在不再坚持自己过去观点的条件下，参加波兰的政治、社会和经济生活的民主化的工作。应该对那些不赞成我们的行动纲领的人提出这样的问题：你们的纲领是什么呢？否定一切和不动脑筋是不能认为是一种纲领的。”
    波兰没有资产阶级政党活动的自由
    哥穆尔卡说，“谁有不同的、更好的、更现实的纲领，就应该向人民提出。没有纲领的政治家向我们说，我们的纲领中没有给一切政党以自由。我们必须回答他们说，在我国是没有资产阶级政党活动的自由的。
    哥穆尔卡说，过去一直不活跃的各政党和社会团体的成员现在开始表示他们的意见，把他们信任的人选到他们的中央机构去。在这种情况下，各政党和社会团体在波兰生活中所起的作用就具有新的意义了。关于这一点的一个表现是建立了中央协商委员会和地方上的类似的委员会。这些机构是常设协商机构，这些机构将形成国家的政治生活，并且为实现社会主义建设的共同纲领而努力。
    哥穆尔卡着重指出，“波兰要走社会主义的道路，同非马克思主义、但是支持党的纲领的政党合作是不可少的，这个纲领同这些政党的愿望是一致的。天主教进步运动参加波兰型式的社会主义也是可能的，因为已经创造了对这有利的条件。维欣斯基红衣主教已经重新进行教会工作。我们要解决一切悬而未决的问题，这些问题是政府代表和教会代表的会谈中所讨论的问题。我们要消除走向充分合作的道路上的一切障碍。我们相信，有行动自由的各级教职人员和全体教士，为了人民和国家的利益，将支持我们的纲领。
    他接着说，只要资产阶级和反动势力不加以利用，波兰民主化的规模能够逐步扩大。和平、秩序、各政党和所有团体组织之间在社会主义建设方面的合作，将有利于波兰社会主义民主的扩大。
        当务之急是加强工农业生产
    哥穆尔卡说，我们正在成立一个没有过去那些偏向的社会主义制度。我们正在创造条件，使工人成为他们自己的企业的管理者。我们给予农民选择这一种或者那一种耕作形式的自由，虽然我们认为集体农庄是一种优越的形式。我们将给各种形式的农业合作社以帮助和支持。在我们的环境里，知识分子完全有创造性发展的可能。我们正在促进手工业的发展。目前我们最紧要的任务就是稳步增加工业和农业生产。这样一个政策现在是波兰人民所期待的。
    哥穆尔卡着重指出，波兰的社会主义形式正在由人民自己形成，并且使它适合于现在的环境。
      只有社会主义的波兰才能自由自主
    他说，“只有社会主义的波兰，才能是自由自主的波兰。这样一个波兰能够日益强大，保证人民就业、改善人民的生活条件。我国的劳动群众决不允许有任何其他的波兰。”
    哥穆尔卡接着说：我的话应当被认为是我们党的一个候选人在选举前的演说。波兰统一工人党的竞选纲领包括在全国统一阵线的共同宣言中。我们的党将同其他政党和社会团体一起参加选举，提出一个共同的选举名单。现在已经从全国各地传来关于提出许多议员候选人的消息。有这样的情形：在一些只能选举几个议员的地区中正在提出甚至几百个候选人。波兰总会有足够的候选人的，但是全国人民现在面临的任务是选举最成熟的人。“在选举候选人的时候有必要考虑：他们到现在为止是在怎样完成他们的公民义务，以及他们是在怎样忘我地为祖国的利益而工作。波兰统一工人党在提出它的候选人的时候将记住这一点。”
