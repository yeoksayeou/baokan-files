　　They interfere in what they shouldn't, and don't interfere in what they should.
　　By our reporter Zhu Bo
    Some comrades say that higher-level cadres interfere too much in the affairs of agricultural cooperatives, resulting in mismanagement and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. To illustrate the correctness of their view, they also described their theoretical basis: in the past, the countryside was a stretch of sand, but after collectivization, it has formed a mud ball; in the past, it was millions of strands of hair, but after collectivization, it has been braided into large braids, one by one. As long as the production organization is well-managed and the cooperative's development plan is well-prepared, the cadres and members of the agricultural cooperative will follow it.

    Some comrades have another view, saying that many things in the agricultural cooperative have not been done well, mainly because the staff interferes too little in the agricultural cooperative. This view also has a factual basis.

    We interviewed several agricultural cooperative cadres, and they believe that the problem is not about interfering too much or too little, but about not interfering in what should be interfered with and interfering in what should not be interfered with. They cited many facts.

    Zhao Yucai, deputy director of the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Xianyang County, is a man with more than thirty years of agricultural production experience, and he is specifically responsible for leading production in the cooperative. He told us such a fact: This year, the "May 1st" cooperative had a reduced wheat yield. Whose responsibility is this? Some people say it was a natural disaster, as the summer harvest coincided with the rainy season. However, many farmers disagree with this view, saying that the wheat yield reduction should be the responsibility of the resident work team.

    The main grain crop of the "May 1st" cooperative is wheat, and farmers can calculate the harvest time based on the time of sowing wheat. They say: Sixty days after the Qingming Festival, the summer harvest can be carried out. This is the experience of local farmers for many years. Sometimes, due to climate and rainfall, it may be wrong, but it can only be wrong by two or three days. This year, they originally calculated that the wheat harvest would begin on June 4th and 5th; because this year's spring rainfall was moderate and the wheat returned to green early and matured early, the cooperative's management committee discussed advancing the wheat harvest by two or three days. On June 2nd, all production teams in the cooperative began harvesting wheat. While harvesting wheat, the comrades of the resident work team said that the wheat was still green, which would cause losses. People said: We have always "harvested half green and half yellow" here, especially this year's wheat has been heavily fertilized, the wheat stalks are strong, and the wheat ears are yellow while the stalks are still green. ... No matter how they explained, the comrades of the work team were not allowed to harvest wheat. The production teams had to stop harvesting. In the evening, the work team also held a meeting of cooperative cadres to criticize this matter. The next day, the wheat was even more ripe. Zhao Yucai rubbed a handful of wheat grains to find the work team. However, he remembered being criticized the night before. When he saw the comrades of the work team, he did not dare to mention harvesting wheat, so he put the rubbed wheat grains in his pocket and walked out. If they didn't harvest, they were afraid of suffering losses; if they harvested, they were afraid of being criticized. What should they do? They came up with a solution: to harvest the wheat in rows, piece by piece. However, even so, the comrades of the work team still rode their bicycles to the fields, changing the wheat that was planned to be harvested in the morning to be harvested in the afternoon; and changing the wheat harvested today to be harvested tomorrow. On June 3rd, only a small number of people were mobilized, harvesting only a hundred acres of wheat. While harvesting wheat, the comrades of the work team did not ask the members to pull the wheat to the threshing ground, but instead asked them to pull manure and plow the fields, preparing to plant autumn crops. The members opposed this, saying that harvesting wheat was like "snatching food from a dragon's mouth," and that there was no need to rush to pull manure and plow the fields. The comrades of the work team did not accept the masses' opinions and insisted on pulling manure and plowing the fields, because they wanted to complete the planned replanting area. Only half of the wheat was harvested when the rain came, and the wheat that was not harvested in time sprouted. According to the research of the cooperative's management committee, the average wheat yield per mu was reduced by fifty jin this year, and the total wheat yield of the cooperative's 6,800 mu was reduced by 340,000 jin. The work team members believed that the yield was reduced by forty jin per mu; even at forty jin, the cooperative's wheat field would still yield 270,000 jin less.

    This kind of thing, interfering in what should not be interfered with, is not just this one instance. This cooperative also had another incident, which also happened on wheat. This year, the cooperative's management committee decided to start sowing wheat early, based on the fact that corn and cotton matured very slowly this year, indicating that the ground was damp and cooled down quickly this year, and wheat must be sown early. To be cautious, Zhao Yucai personally conducted a sowing experiment in advance and studied it with experienced old farmers in the cooperative. According to experienced old farmers: "When the reeds hold up umbrellas (referring to reed panicles), half of the wheat is sown," the reeds have already sprouted spikes, and it is time to sow wheat. Some old farmers said: "When the Shen Wang star points directly south (referring to when the Shen Wang star is directly south when the sky is just bright), wheat is sown with joy." This is the experience passed down from older generations, and it is time to sow wheat. Just as the cooperative was preparing to sow, the comrades of the agricultural technology extension station heard about it and believed that the ground was too wet this year, and early sowing would easily cause wheat seedlings to grow excessively, so they disagreed with the "May 1st" cooperative sowing early. Zhao Yucai told the reasons for sowing wheat early to the personnel of the extension station, but they still insisted on postponing the sowing plan. Later, Zhao Yucai came up with another idea, saying that early planting was jointly proposed by the production teams. If they were not allowed to sow wheat early, the production teams would not implement the contracted production system. This method worked.

    The wheat sown early by the "May 1st" cooperative looked lush green in the eighth day. The wheat in the nearby agricultural cooperatives, because of the late sowing, had poor emergence and severe stand loss. Everyone acknowledged that the wheat in the other cooperatives did not grow as well as the wheat in the "May 1st" cooperative.

    This kind of example is not an isolated case. For example, the error of forcibly plowing up millet to plant corn in Liquan County, resulting in reduced yields, etc. It can be seen that some resident cadres and personnel of agricultural technology extension stations do not pay attention to investigating and studying the local situation, and they insist that the cooperative act according to their requirements.

    In the "May 1st" cooperative, it can also be seen that the work team does not manage the things that should be managed. The "May 1st" cooperative is a large cooperative, including five natural villages, one of which entered the advanced cooperative without having run a primary cooperative. Many people have ideological problems, some members have a bad attitude towards labor, and some members say strange things... The cooperative cadres often went to this village, but they could not solve the problem, so they suggested that the comrades of the work team go to help solve it. Although the comrades of the work team went, they did not solve the problem because they did not think of any specific solutions. This team is still the most backward team in the cooperative. Also, before the summer harvest this year, some members of the "May 1st" cooperative suffered from food shortages. The cooperative cadres repeatedly asked the comrades of the work team to help find a solution, but the work team never took care of it. Later, the cooperative cadres discussed organizing members to open flour mills and burn bricks to solve the food shortage problem of some members. When the cooperative cadres told the comrades of the work team about this idea, they not only did not support it, but also said that the cooperative cadres had capitalist ideas. Therefore, the problem has not been solved, causing great dissatisfaction among the members. It is said that the comrades of the work team have recently agreed to allow the opening of flour mills. The cooperative accountant was doing the preliminary pre-distribution accounting for the first time and was afraid of making mistakes. He repeatedly asked the comrades of the work team to help review it, but they refused. Even now, when the cooperative cadres mention these problems, they still express great dissatisfaction.

    How should resident staff help the cooperative work? What should be managed and what should not be managed? Some experiences and lessons can be found here.

　　有人说：上级的工作人员对农业社的事管得太多了。有人说：管得太少了。究竟是怎么回事？农业社的干部作了这样的回答：
　　不该管的管了，该管的没有管
　　本报记者　朱波
    有些同志说，上级的干部对农业社里的事情管的太多，结果把事情管坏了，引起群众的不满。为了说明他的看法正确，他还叙述了他的理论根据：过去农村是一片沙，合作化之后已经形成一个泥团；过去是千百万根头发，合作化之后已经编了一根一根的大辫子，只要把生产组织搞好，做好社的发展规划，农业社的干部和社员就会照着办。
    有些同志又有另一种说法，说是农业社很多事没作好，主要是工作人员对农业社管的太少了，这种说法也有事实根据。
    我们访问了几个农业社的干部，他们认为问题不在管多了管少了，而是该管的不管，不该管的反倒管了。他们列举了很多事实。
    咸阳县“五一”农业社副主任赵育才，是一个有三十多年农业生产经验的人，他在社内专门负责领导生产。他向我们谈了这样一个事实：今年“五一”社小麦减产了，这是谁的责任呢？有些人说是天灾，夏收赶上了雨季。但是，很多农民都不同意这种看法，他们说小麦减产应由驻社工作组负责。
    “五一”社的主要粮食作物是小麦，农民们都能根据播种小麦的时间，来计算收获的时间。他们说：过了清明节后六十天就可以进行夏收了，这是当地农民多年来的经验；有时候由于气候雨水的关系也可能错，但是也只能错两三天。今年他们原计算是在6月4日、5日开始收麦；因为今年春季雨水调和，小麦返青早，成熟的早，因此，社里的管委会讨论要提前两三天收割小麦。6月2日，全社各个生产队就开始收麦了。正在收麦时，住社工作组的同志却说小麦还青着哩，这样会造成损失。人们说：我们这里多年来就是“绿收一半黄收一半”，特别是今年的麦子施肥多，麦子秆壮，麦穗黄了秆子还是绿的。……不管怎样解释，工作组的同志反正不准收麦。各生产队只好停止收割。晚上，工作组还召开了社干部会议，对这件事情进行批评。第二天麦子熟的更多了，赵育才搓了一把麦粒去找工作组。可是他又想起昨天晚上受批评的事，见到工作组的同志没有敢提收小麦的事，就把搓下的麦粒装在口袋里走出来了。不收恐怕受损失，收麦又怕受批评，怎么办呢？他们想了一个办法：把小麦排排队，一块一块的收。但是，就这样，工作组的同志还是骑着车子赶到地里，把上午计划收割的小麦改为下午收割；把今天收割的改为明天收割。6月3日只出动了很少一部人，共收了百多亩小麦。在收麦的时候，工作组的同志不叫社员向场里拉麦子，却叫回地里拉粪和犁地，准备种秋。社员们都反对，说收麦是“龙口里夺食”，拉粪和犁地不要忙。工作组的同志没有接受群众的意见，仍坚持着拉粪和犁地，因为他们要完成复种面积的计划。小麦只收了一半，雨来了，来不及收割的小麦都生了芽。据该社管委会研究，今年平均每亩小麦少收五十斤，全社共六千八百亩小麦，共减产三十四万斤。工作组的人员认为每亩减产四十斤；就以四十斤计算，全社麦田也要少收二十七万斤。
    像这种不应管而管的事情不止这一件。这个社还有一件事，也发生在小麦上。今年该社管委会决定要提前进行小麦播种，他们的根据是今年玉米棉花成熟得很慢，说明今年地湿凉的快，一定要提前播种小麦。为了慎重，事先赵育才亲自进行了播种试验，同社里有经验的老农民进行研究。据有经验的老农民说：“苇子打伞（指苇穗），麦种一半”，苇子已经吐穗了，是种麦的时候了。有的老农民说：“参王端（指参王星天刚明的时候在正南方向），麦种欢”，这是老辈传下来的经验，这时候该种麦了。社里正准备播种，农业技术推广站的同志听说了，他们认为今年地湿高，提前播种，麦苗容易疯长，因此，就不同意“五一”社提前播种。赵育才把提前种麦的理由告诉了推广站的人员，他们还是坚持要把播种计划推迟。后来，赵育才又想了个办法，说早种是各生产队共同研究提出来的，如果不叫提前播种小麦，生产队就不实行包产了。这个办法生了效。
      “五一”社提前播种的小麦，第八天麦行就显得绿油油的了。附近的几个农业社的小麦，因为播种迟，出苗不好，断条现象特别严重，大家都公认各社的小麦都不如“五一”社的小麦长的好。
    这种例子不是个别的。例如在醴泉县发生的硬要农民犁掉谷子种玉米而减产的错误等。可以看出，确有一些驻社干部和农业技术推广站的人员不注意调查研究当地情况，还硬要社里按他们的要求办事。
    在“五一”社里，还可以看出工作组对那些应该管的事情却又不管的事例。“五一”社是个大社，包括五个自然村，其中有个村没有办过初级社就入了高级社，很多人思想上有问题，有些社员劳动态度不好，有的社员说怪话，……社干部常到这个村里去，总解决不了问题，于是就建议工作组的同志去帮助解决。工作组的同志虽然去了，但是，因为没有多想具体办法，仍然没有解决问题。这个队现在仍然是全社最落后的一个队。又如今年夏收前，“五一”社有一部分社员闹粮荒，社干部一再要求工作组的同志帮助想办法，但是工作组始终没有管。后来，社干部商量组织社员开粉房和烧砖来解决某些社员的粮荒问题。当社干部把这个意见告诉工作组的同志的时候，他们不但不支持，反而说社干部有资本主义思想，因此，问题一直没有解决，引起了社员很大不满。据说最近工作组的同志才答应可以开粉房。社里会计员初次做预分核算，怕搞出错误，数次请工作组的同志帮助审核一下，但是他们却拒绝了。直到现在，社干部提起这些问题来，还表示非常不满。
    驻社工作人员究竟应该怎样帮助社里工作？哪些该管哪些不该管？从这里是可以找到一些经验教训的。
