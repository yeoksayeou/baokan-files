A Debate on Subjectivism and Bureaucratism
Fang Kang

Not long ago, a debate on the issue of subjectivism and bureaucratism occurred in the Southern Daily, triggered by a report published by the Southern Daily about the Party organization in Hua County, Guangdong Province, forcing farmers to harvest immature wheat. From this debate, it can be seen that many cadres have an unclear understanding of subjectivism and bureaucratism, and even blindly defend them.

The course of events was as follows: In order to advance the time of early rice transplanting, the Hua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided that all farmers in the county should harvest the spring wheat before April 5th. At the time, many cadres disagreed with this decision, because in some areas the wheat was only 40 to 80 percent ripe. The County Committee not only did not consider the opinions of these cadres, but also criticized them. Deng Yaoguang, a member of the County Committee who was in charge of the work in Fengcun and other townships, was criticized and ordered cadres to urge the masses to harvest unripe wheat. As a result, Fengcun Township alone lost more than 30,000 jin of wheat. This naturally caused great dissatisfaction among the masses.

After the report was published, many readers wrote to the Southern Daily, expressing their indignation at the incident and unanimously agreeing that the cadres' commandist style should be corrected. The subjectivism and bureaucratism of the leading organs are the root causes of cadres' commandism and deserve equal attention. The report also caused dissatisfaction among some members of the Hua County Committee. A reader named Li Si wrote to the Southern Daily, criticizing the newspaper's reporter for "making conclusions based on personal subjective conjecture" and for "making an unfair defense of errors." After Li Si's letter was published, many readers wrote to the newspaper to oppose his views, but some readers also supported his views, and thus a debate unfolded in the newspaper.

The first issue addressed in the debate was, who exactly was "making an unfair defense of errors." Li Si and readers with similar opinions believed that: First, the Hua County Committee's decision to finish harvesting wheat before April 5th was correct and fully conformed to the objective reality at the time. The evidence for this was that only more than 3,000 mu of fields in Fengcun and other townships harvested unripe wheat, and it did not occur simultaneously throughout the county. Second, the county's leading organs only bore "a certain responsibility" for this incident, while the reporter pushed the main responsibility to the county's leading organs, which was unfair and defended the errors of Deng Yaoguang, the County Committee member in charge of the work in Fengcun and other townships.

Was the decision of the Hua County Committee correct? Many readers believed that it was incorrect, and Li Si's arguments were untenable. First, it was self-contradictory. Reader Lun Tinghu pointed out: If the decision was said to be "correct," then it should be commended, why did it also say that the county's leading organs must bear "a certain responsibility"? Second, Li Si concealed a very important fact: it was not only in Fengcun and other townships that wheat was not yet ripe before April 5th. Readers Zhu Wu, Luo Fu, and others pointed out that in the joint agricultural production cooperatives with the earliest wheat maturity in the county, 19% of the wheat was still not ripe on April 5th; the county as a whole actually did not finish harvesting wheat until April 15th; the reason why the incident of harvesting unripe wheat did not occur throughout the county was simply because most areas did not mechanically implement the County Committee's decision. Moreover, even if the wheat was not fully ripe only in Fengcun and other townships, the County Committee should have considered this local situation when making its decision, so that the decision could flexibly adapt to the conditions in various regions. Only considering the local situation where wheat matured early (even if this local situation was relatively large), and requiring the local situation where wheat matured late (even if this local situation was relatively small) to mechanically implement unified regulations, would still be a mistake. At the same time, cadres had indeed raised objections to this decision. According to Deng Yaoguang and other cadres in Hua County, Deng Yaoguang had raised objections at the time, believing that this decision was unworkable. Even Wei Zhen, a reader who defended Li Si, admitted that at the enlarged meeting held by the County Committee, cadres from some areas such as Shiling, Tanbu, and Chini districts believed that it would be difficult to complete the wheat harvesting task by April 5th, for the reasons that: First, the wheat was not fully ripe, and second, there were difficulties in labor allocation. However, the County Committee did not seriously consider these opinions and insisted on the lower levels to implement this decision, resulting in the incident of harvesting unripe wheat. Can it be said that this had nothing to do with the County Committee, or that it was only a matter of insufficient education of cadres?

Li Si's opinion represented the opinions of some of the main responsible cadres of the Hua County Committee. After the newspaper exposed the incident of harvesting unripe wheat, the County Committee did not seriously learn from this mistake, let alone strengthen the education of cadres through this incident; on the contrary, it haggled over who should bear the main responsibility, and even, like Li Si, turned around and accused the reporter who reported the incident.

Li Si and readers with similar views also believed that the incident of harvesting unripe wheat only occurred in Fengcun and other townships, and did not occur in other areas, which shows that this was only a matter of the ideological quality of individual leading cadres, not a problem of the leadership of the entire County Committee. This view is also one-sided.

Many readers pointed out that such incidents of commandism not only occurred in Fengcun Township and other places in Hua County, but also occurred in Yangchun and Yingde counties, where farmers also suffered losses. This shows that the commandist style was quite prevalent in the work of leading agricultural production in the first half of this year.

Why was the phenomenon of commandism so prevalent? One of the main reasons is that after the criticism of conservative thinking in the cooperativization movement, the subjectivist and bureaucratic work style of the leading organs developed. They did not seriously investigate and study the actual situation, and did not proceed from the different characteristics of different regions, and required uniformity in everything. In their leadership of production, regardless of mountainous or plain areas, they focused on rice production; in planting rice, regardless of water conservancy, geological, and human conditions, they used the same improved varieties, and even had uniform specifications for transplanting, and uniform regulations for the time of sowing and harvesting. For example, for this year's early rice transplanting in Guangdong, from the Provincial Party Committee to the Prefectural Party Committee, the County Party Committee, and the District Party Committee, the same transplanting time was stipulated; these decisions themselves were products of subjectivism, and whoever mechanically implemented them would inevitably run into snags.

Such erroneous decisions were not without opportunities for correction. The grassroots cadres and masses who implemented the decisions were in contact with reality and were able to discover the errors and one-sidedness in the decisions of the leading organs. In Hua County, many cadres raised different opinions about the County Committee's subjectivist decisions. Therefore, as long as the leading organs humbly listened to their opinions, they could supplement and modify the incomplete or erroneous decisions. However, many Party organizations and cadres, not only did not consult with the masses before making resolutions and instructions, but also relied on orders to do things when implementing resolutions, instead of adopting methods of persuasion and education for the masses. This situation exists not only in the leading organs at the county level, but also in the leading organs at the provincial level. Reader Zhang Hui pointed out that the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee stipulated that the province's early rice transplanting work should be completed before "Grain Rain" this year, and the "District and Township Cadre Newspaper" sponsored by the Provincial Party Committee repeatedly emphasized that it must be completed on time, and whoever failed to complete it would be treated as dereliction of duty. In this way, the tasks were passed down level by level from the province to the prefecture to the county, forcing the masses to implement them. How could the phenomenon of commandism not occur in large quantities? Some people said that Deng Yaoguang had raised objections to the decision of the Hua County Committee, so why did the County Committee not carefully consider these opinions, even if they were individual and few? Why did it not carefully consider and study the actual situation below? Some people said that Deng Yaoguang had not raised objections to the decision of the County Committee, so why did he not dare to raise objections even though he clearly knew that the decision did not conform to the actual situation? Why could the opinions of all parties not be fully reflected when the County Committee meeting discussed major work issues? No matter which situation it was, did it not equally prove that the democratic atmosphere in the Hua County Party organization was very weak? Did it not equally prove that the Hua County Party's leading organs did not well implement the Party's mass line and did not seriously implement the principle of collective leadership?

It can be seen that the occurrence of the Hua County wheat harvesting incident was of course the result of Deng Yaoguang's commandism and was inseparable from the shortcomings in his ideological style; but more importantly, this incident was forced out by the subjectivist decisions and undemocratic style of the leading organs above the county level. Therefore, in discussing the Hua County unripe wheat harvesting incident, if we only attribute it to the quality of one person, and do not draw universal lessons from it and improve the Party's leadership level, it will be difficult to avoid the recurrence of the same or even more serious errors in the future.

    一场关于主观主义官僚主义的争论
    方亢
    不久以前，在南方日报上发生了一场关于主观主义和官僚主义问题的争论，它是由南方日报发表的一篇广东省花县党的组织强迫农民收割未成熟小麦的报道所引起的。从这场争论中可以看出，许多干部对主观主义官僚主义是认识不清的，甚至盲目地为主观主义官僚主义辩护。
    事情的经过是这样的：中共花县县委员会为了提早早稻插秧时间，决定全县农民在4月5日以前割完春收小麦。当时不少干部不同意这个决定，因为有些地方的小麦还只有四成到八成熟。县委会不仅没有考虑这些干部的意见，并且批评了这些干部。领导冯村等乡工作的县委委员邓耀光受到批评后，就命令干部督促群众割了生麦，这样，单冯村乡就损失麦子三万斤以上。这当然引起了群众的非常不满。
    这篇报道发表以后，许多读者写信给南方日报，对这个事件表示愤慨，一致认为干部的强迫命令作风必须纠正。而领导机关的主观主义和官僚主义，是干部发生强迫命令的根源，同样值得注意。这个报道还引起了花县一些县委委员的不满。读者李四写信给南方日报，批评该报记者是“凭个人的主观臆测乱下结论”，是“给错误作了不公正的辩护”。李四的信发表以后，就有许多读者写信给报社反对他的意见，但是也有一些读者支持他的意见，于是一场争论就在报纸上展开了。
    争论接触到的第一个问题是，到底谁“给错误作了不公正的辩护”。李四以及和他意见相近的读者认为：第一，花县县委会4月5日以前割完小麦的决定是正确的，完全符合当时的客观实际。证据是收割生麦的，只有冯村等乡的三千多亩田，并没有在全县范围内同时出现。第二，县的领导机关对这个事件只负“一定的责任”，而记者却把主要责任推给县的领导机关，因此是不公正的，是为领导冯村等乡工作的县委委员邓耀光的错误作辩护。
    花县县委会的决定是不是正确的呢？许多读者认为是不正确的，李四等人的论点是站不住脚的。首先，它前后矛盾。读者伦庭鹄指出：这个决定既然说是“正确”的，就应该表扬才是，为甚么又说县的领导机关必须负“一定的责任”呢？其次，李四掩盖了一个很重要的事实：4月5日以前小麦尚未成熟的，不仅是冯村等几个乡。读者朱五、洛夫等指出，该县小麦成熟最早的联合农业生产合作社，在4月5日还有19％的小麦未成熟；全县实际上在4月15日以前还未割完小麦；割生麦事件之所以没有在全县范围内出现，只是因为大多数地区没有机械执行县委会的决定。而且即使小麦未完全成熟的仅仅是冯村等几个乡，县委会在作出决定的时候，也应当考虑这一局部的情况，使决定能够灵活地适应各个地区的情况。只考虑小麦成熟早的局部（即使这个局部比较大），而要小麦成熟迟的局部（即使这个局部比较少）机械执行统一的规定，仍然是会犯错误的。同时干部对于这个决定并不是没有提过意见。据邓耀光和花县其他一些干部对记者说，当时邓耀光曾经提出意见，他认为这个决定行不通。就是为李四辩护的读者唯真也承认：在县委会召开的扩大会议上，部分地区如狮岭、炭步、赤坭等区的干部，都认为4月5日完成割麦任务有困难，原因是：第一、小麦未全部成熟，第二、劳动力调配有困难。但是县委会没有认真地考虑这些意见，仍然一意要下边执行这个决定，结果造成割生麦事件，难道可以说同县委会毫无关系，或者仅仅负对干部教育不够的责任吗？
    李四的意见，是代表了花县县委会一些主要负责干部的意见的。在报纸揭发了割生麦事件以后，县委没有认真地吸取这一错误的教训，更没有通过这一事件，加强对干部的教育；相反地，却斤斤计较谁负主要责任，甚至像李四那样，反过来指责进行报道的记者。
    李四以及和他相近的读者还认为，割生麦事件只在冯村等乡发生，而没有在其他地区发生，可见这只是个别领导干部的思想品质问题，不是整个县委会领导的问题。这种看法也是片面的。
    许多读者指出：这类强迫命令的事件，不仅发生在冯村乡和花县的其他一些地方，也在阳春、英德两县发生过，那里的农民同样受到了损失。这就说明了强迫命令作风在今年上半年领导农业生产的工作中，是相当普遍地存在的。
    为什么会普遍地发生强迫命令的现象呢？主要原因之一，是合作化运动中批判了保守思想以后，领导机关的主观主义、官僚主义作风有了发展，他们不认真调查研究实际情况，不从不同地区的不同特点出发，什么工作都强求一律。他们领导生产，不管山区平原，一律以稻谷生产为主；种植稻谷，又不问水利、地质、人力等条件怎样，一律用一种良种，甚至连插秧也有统一的规格，播种、收割的时间也有统一的规定。例如广东今年的早造插秧，从省委直到地委、县委、区委，都规定了同一的插秧时间；这些决定本身就是主观主义的产物，凡是机械地执行的，就一定碰壁。
    这种错误的决定，并不是没有修正的机会。执行决定的基层干部和群众是接触实际的，是能够发现领导机关决定中的错误和片面的地方的。花县就有不少干部对县委的主观主义的决定，提出了不同意见。因此只要领导机关虚心地听取他们的意见，就可以将不全面的或错误的决定加以补充和修改。但是，不少党的组织和干部，不但在作出决议指示以前，不同群众商量，而且在执行决议的时候，对群众不是采取说服教育的办法，而是依靠命令办事。这种情况，不仅县委一级的领导机关存在，省一级的领导机关也同样存在。读者章茴指出，广东省委规定今年的早造插秧工作全省要在“谷雨”以前完成，省委主办的“区乡干部报”就一再强调必须按期完成，谁不完成就以失职论处。这样从省到专区到县，一级级地把任务压下去，强制群众执行，怎么会不大量地产生强迫命令的现象呢。有些人说，邓耀光是对花县县委会的决定提过意见的，那末，为什么县委会不好好地考虑这些即使是个别的少数的意见呢？为什么不好好地考虑和研究一下下面的实际情况呢？有人说，邓耀光没有对县委会的决定提过意见，那末为什么他明明知道决定不符合实际情况，也不敢提意见呢？为什么县委会议讨论重大的工作问题时不能充分反映各方面的意见呢？不管是那一种情况，不是都一样地证明了花县党组织的民主空气很薄弱吗？不是都一样地证明了花县党的领导机关没有很好地贯彻党的群众路线，没有认真地贯彻集体领导的原则吗？
    由此可见，花县割麦事件之产生，固然是邓耀光强迫命令的结果，是同他的思想作风上的缺点分不开的；但更重要的是，这个事件是县级以上领导机关的主观主义决定和不民主的作风所逼出来的。因此，在讨论花县割生麦这个事件时，如果仅仅归咎于某一个人的品质，而不从中吸取普遍的教训，提高党的领导水平，今后就难免不再发生同样的甚至更严重的错误。
