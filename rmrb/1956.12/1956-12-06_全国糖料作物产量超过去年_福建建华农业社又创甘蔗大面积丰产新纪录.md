Xinhua News Agency, December 5th – According to the Ministry of Agriculture's estimate, national sugarcane and sugar beet production this year has increased compared to last year. However, neither has met the original state production plan. This is because the main sugarcane and sugar beet producing provinces, such as Guangdong, Fujian, and Heilongjiang, suffered from typhoon and flood disasters from June to September.

This year, significant progress has been made in the work of promoting improved sugarcane and sugar beet varieties in various sugarcane and sugar beet producing areas, and many advanced production experiences have been implemented in production. According to statistics, the national area newly planted with improved sugarcane varieties has doubled compared to last year, totaling 290,000 mu. Due to strengthened cultivation techniques and field management, the sugar yield per mu of these newly promoted improved sugarcane varieties has increased by 30% to 40% compared to last year. In Fujian Province, 60% to 70% of the newly planted sugarcane uses lime water soaking for seeds. In some areas, densely planted sugarcane accounts for 80% of the total area. Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have also trained a large number of sugarcane technicians for agricultural cooperatives. Jianhua Agricultural Cooperative in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, has broken their national record for large-scale high-yield sugarcane production created last year. The cooperative's more than 200 mu of sugarcane can produce an average of 20,000 jin per mu. Many high-yield cooperatives have also emerged in various sugar beet producing areas, with some high-yield cooperatives achieving a maximum yield of more than 16,000 jin per mu, which is five times higher than the general yield.

　　全国糖料作物产量超过去年
　　福建建华农业社又创甘蔗大面积丰产新纪录
    新华社5日讯　据农业部预计，今年全国甘蔗和甜菜都比去年增产，但是都没有完成国家原定的生产计划，这是因为甘蔗和甜菜的主要产区广东、福建和黑龙江等省，在6月至9月份遭到了台风侵袭和雨涝等灾害。
    今年各地甘蔗、甜菜产区推广甘蔗、甜菜良种的工作有显著成绩，并且在生产中推行了许多先进生产经验。据统计，全国新推广的甘蔗良种面积比去年增加了一倍，总数达二十九万亩，由于加强了栽培技术和田间管理，这些新推广的良种甘蔗每亩的产糖量比去年增加了三成到四成。福建省新种的甘蔗中有60％到70％都采用石灰水浸种，有些地区甘蔗的密植面积占到总面积的80％。广东、广西两省还为农业社训练了大批甘蔗技术员。福建省仙游县建华农业社今年又打破了他们去年创造的全国甘蔗大面积丰产纪录，全社种植的二百多亩甘蔗，平均每亩可产两万斤。各甜菜产区也出现了不少高额丰产社，有些丰产社每亩的最高产量达到一万六千多斤，比一般产量多五倍。
