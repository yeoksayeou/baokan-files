　　Long Live Peace
　　Under the window of Yan Zhen’s newly built thatched cottage, there is a steel helmet placed as a flowerpot, planted with a rose. The rose flowers are blooming, making the window paper red, like the setting sun, rising from this steel helmet. The owner has returned from the fields, carrying golden wheat stalks. The sickle at his waist is like a faint crescent moon in the twilight. This young man was the one who captured that steel helmet at the front line, and he was the one who planted that rose tree with his own hands after demobilization. He puts down the wheat stalks on his shoulder, busily watering the flowers. On his chest is a medal, cast with: Long Live Peace.

　　和平万岁
　　严阵新盖的茅屋窗下，摆着一顶钢盔，钢盔当成花盆，栽着一棵玫瑰，玫瑰花儿正开，映得窗纸通红，像那已落山的太阳，正从这钢盔里上升，主人从地里回来了，背着金色的麦棵，他腰里别着的镰刀像薄暮里的一弯淡月，就是这个年轻人，在前线缴获了那顶钢盔，就是他复员以后，亲手栽下了那棵玫瑰，他放下肩上的麦棵，忙着去给花儿浇水，他胸前有颗纪念章，铸着：和平万岁。
