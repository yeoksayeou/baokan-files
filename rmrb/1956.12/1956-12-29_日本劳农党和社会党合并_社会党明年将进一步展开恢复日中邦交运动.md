    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 27th: Leaders of the Japan Socialist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party decided today that the two parties would merge.

    This agreement was jointly negotiated by Asanuma Inejirō, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Sasaki Kōzō, Chairman of the Election Countermeasures Committee, Anping Luyi, Director of the Organization Bureau, Matsui Masayoshi, Minister of Organization, and Kuroda Hisao, Chairman of the Labor-Farmer Party, Ishino Hisao, Secretary-General, and Kubota Yutaka.

    The two parties agreed that: 1. The Labor-Farmer Party recognizes the program, policies, and party constitution of the Socialist Party, dissolves the Labor-Farmer Party, and all members join the Socialist Party; 2. The two parties should work together to complete the procedures for Labor-Farmer Party members to join the Socialist Party before the Socialist Party Congress to be held on January 17.

    Both sides decided that the Labor-Farmer Party will hold a conference to dissolve the party on January 15th and 16th next year. The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party will hold a meeting on January 11th next year to approve the membership of Labor-Farmer Party members and will submit a report to the Socialist Party Congress to be held from January 17th, requesting approval.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 27th: The Japan Socialist Party will further promote the national movement to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations in the coming year.

    At the same time, the Socialist Party will also make maintaining the peaceful constitution, opposing military bases, and demanding the return of Okinawa Island the main content of the struggle for peace and independence in the coming year. These movements will be coordinated with the movement to demand the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs. The common goal of these movements is to revise or abolish unequal treaties.

    [Editor's Note] The Japan Labor-Farmer Party is the abbreviation of the Labor-Farmer Party. It broke away from the Socialist Party in December 1948 and was composed of the left wing of the Socialist Party, the left wing of the Japan Farmers' Union, and neutral Labor-Farmer Diet members. It has a certain influence among Japanese workers, farmers, and citizens. The Labor-Farmer Party opposes Japanese militarization and advocates socialism. It affirms that China and the Soviet Union are the center of international peace forces and advocates promoting Japan-China and Japan-Soviet relations. The Labor-Farmer Party has four seats in the House of Representatives.
