Xinhua News Agency, Tripoli, December 25th (TASS): Libyan Prime Minister Mustafa Ben Halim delivered a speech on December 24th, celebrating the fifth anniversary of Libya's declaration of independence. He said that Libya's declaration of independence in 1951 was the result of the Libyan people's long struggle, and it opened a new chapter in Libyan history. He said that this year, when the Libyan people celebrate Independence Day, French troops have completely withdrawn from the Fezzan region. Halim spoke highly of the role of the United Nations and the efforts made by peace-loving people in stopping imperialist aggression in Egypt.

Halim pointed out that the Libyan people, who hate all forms of aggression, deeply sympathize with the struggle of the Algerian people.

Halim concluded by saying that the Libyan government will always act in the interests of the country and defend the national independence it has won with great sacrifices.

(Editor's Note) The Kingdom of Libya is located in North Africa, facing the Mediterranean Sea, between Egypt, Tunisia, and West Africa. From the 16th century, Cyrenaica and Tripoli in Libya were successively reduced to colonies of Turkey and Italy. Britain and France occupied Libya in 1943. After World War II, American forces quickly penetrated Libya and established many military bases. The Libyan people waged a long struggle for independence, and finally, on December 24, 1951, the United Kingdom of Libya was established. However, Libya's military, political, and economic affairs are still controlled by American, British, and French imperialism, making it an important naval and air military base for them. In March 1953, Libya joined the Arab League. Last year, Libya joined the United Nations. Since the beginning of this year, the Libyan government has repeatedly stated that Libya will remain neutral, oppose the use of Libyan bases by the United States and Britain to attack Arab countries, and express its willingness to cooperate in friendship with all peace-loving countries.

    庆祝利比亚独立五周年
    利比亚首相表示要保卫独立
    新华社26日讯　塔斯社的黎波里25日讯：利比亚首相穆斯塔法·本·哈利姆24日在庆祝利比亚宣告独立五周年的时候发表了演说。他说，1951年利比亚宣告独立是利比亚人民长时期斗争的结果，它在利比亚的历史中打开了新的一页。他说，今年利比亚人民庆祝独立日的时候，法国军队已经完全撤离了费赞地区。哈利姆对于联合国的作用以及爱好和平的人民在制止帝国主义在埃及的侵略中所做的努力给予很高的评价。
    哈利姆指出，憎恨任何形式侵略的利比亚人民深深同情阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。
    哈利姆最后说，利比亚政府将永远本着国家的利益行事，并且要保卫它用巨大的牺牲换来的民族独立。
    （编者注）利比亚王国在非洲北部，面临地中海，介于埃及、突尼斯和西非之间。十六世纪起，利比亚的昔兰尼和的黎波里曾先后沦为土耳其和意大利的殖民地。英法于1943年分别占领了利比亚。第二次世界大战后，美国势力很快伸入利比亚，建立了许多军事基地。利比亚人民为争取独立进行了长期的斗争，终于在1951年12月24日成立了利比亚联合王国。但利比亚的军事、政治和经济，仍受到美英法帝国主义的控制，成为它们的重要海空军事基地。1953年3月利比亚加入了阿拉伯联盟。去年，利比亚参加了联合国。今年以来，利比亚政府一再表示利比亚将保持中立，反对美英使用利比亚的基地进攻阿拉伯国家，并且表示愿同一切爱好和平的国家友好合作。
