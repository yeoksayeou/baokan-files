　　Tibet River Transport Survey Work Begins
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, December 3rd: A river transport survey team set off from here yesterday to work. They will follow the Lhasa River via Qushui to the Yarlung Zangbo River, and then along the Yarlung Zangbo River to Zela Dzong in the lower reaches, and then upstream along the Nyang River, collecting various data and studying rectification plans.
    The river transport survey team was dispatched by the Transportation Department of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Transportation Department plans to first connect the Lhasa River, Yarlung Zangbo River, and Nyang River for navigation, and then open up other waterways. At present, only some sections of individual rivers in Tibet can be navigated by yak-hide boats, and only downstream. The transportation department plans to use motor-driven boats on the aforementioned rivers to solve the problems of upstream navigation and towed transport.
    Inner Mongolia Discovers Silica Sand
    This newspaper reports: Near Ganqika Town, Horqin Left Back Banner, Jirem League, Inner Mongolia, there is a type of natural fine sand ore (also known as silica sand). This fine sand is an excellent material for manufacturing glass, glassware, magnetic bottles, and sand casting models. It contains approximately 90% silicon dioxide, as well as components such as aluminum, calcium, magnesium, and iron.
    According to the current mining situation, the reserves of natural fine sand are very abundant. The currently excavated part above the water table averages two meters in depth. The part buried below the water table has not yet been measured. This type of fine sand is suitable for open-pit mining. (Yue Fengjun)
    Abundant Coal Reserves in Mount Bagong
    This newspaper reports: After more than a year of exploration by the 120 Exploration Team of the East China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau in the Bagong Mountain coalfield of Huainan Coal Mine, it has been proven that from Maojiawa in the eastern foothills of Bagong Mountain Plain, via Li Yingzi, Xie Jiaji and Xinzhuangzi mining areas to the north of Bijia Gang, the total length is thirteen kilometers and the width is two point five kilometers. It has been explored to a vertical depth of seven hundred meters from the ground, with a total of twenty-five coal seams (including the twelve locally mined), with a minable thickness of around thirty-five meters. The thickest coal seam is six meters, and the general ones are around two meters. According to the current annual output of the entire Huainan Coal Mine, the total coal reserves can be mined for more than one hundred and fifty years.
    The quality of the deep coal in the Bagong Mountain coalfield of Huainan Coal Mine is very good. Not only is there gas-fat coal and other power coal with low sulfur, phosphorus and ash content, but the coal quality of slots one, three, four and eight fully meets the requirements of metallurgical coking coal.

　　西藏河运调查工作开始
    据新华社拉萨3日电　一个河运调查组昨天从这里出发工作。他们将沿拉萨河经曲水到雅鲁藏布江，再顺雅鲁藏布江到下游的则拉宗，然后逆尼洋河而上，搜集各种资料，研究整治方案。
    河运调查组是西藏自治区筹备委员会交通处派出的。交通处计划第一步先将拉萨河、雅鲁藏布江和尼洋河的航运联接起来，再开辟其他河道。在目前，西藏还只有个别河流的一部分地段能通行牛皮船，并且只能顺流航行。交通部门准备在上述河流采用马达带动的船，来解决逆水船行和拖载运输的问题。
    内蒙古发现硅砂
    本报讯　在内蒙古哲里木盟科左后旗甘旗卡镇附近，有一种天然细砂矿（又叫硅砂）。这种细砂，是制造玻璃、玻璃器具、电磁瓶、翻砂铸造模型的上好材料。其中含二氧化硅达90％左右，还含有铝、钙、镁、铁等成分。
    据已开采的情况估计，天然细砂储藏量十分丰富，现在挖掘的在水皮上面部分，平均有二公尺。埋藏在水皮下面的还没测量过。这种细砂适于露天挖掘。　　（岳凤君）
    八公山煤藏丰富
    本报讯　淮南煤矿八公山煤田经过华东煤田地质勘探局一二○勘探队一年多时间勘探证明，自八公山东麓平原毛家洼起，经李郢孜、谢家集和新庄孜井田到毕家岗以北，全长十三公里，宽二点五公里，自地面垂深七百公尺以上已经探清，共有煤二十五层（包括局部开采的十二层在内），可采厚度在三十五公尺上下，煤层最厚的达六公尺，一般的都在二公尺左右。煤的总储量，拿目前整个淮南煤矿的年产量计算，就可以开采一百五十多年。
    淮南煤矿八公山煤田深部煤的质量很好，不仅有含硫、磷和灰分较低的气肥煤等动力煤，而且一、三、四、八槽的煤质完全符合冶金配焦煤的要求。　（胡正海）
