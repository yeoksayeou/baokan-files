　　Breaking Through the Siege of Meetings and Reports
　　Shanghai's Over 3,000 Jointly Operated Factories' Factory Directors Strengthen Concrete Leadership
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 6th (Xinhua News Agency Reporter Xu Fangyi reporting): The factory directors of over 3,000 newly jointly operated factories under the Shanghai First Light Industry Bureau have recently started to have more time to lead production.

    Four months ago, this reporter visited the Guanghua Tannery, a joint state-private enterprise, and could not find the state-appointed factory director. People said it would be easier to find the director in the meeting room of the First Light Industry Bureau or a specialized company. Recently, this reporter visited the factory again, and did not find the director in the factory director's office. It turned out he had gone to the workshop to understand the production situation. This time, people said that in the past, out of the twenty-five actual working days in a month, this director spent an average of twenty days attending various meetings convened by relevant units, and the remaining time was only used to handle some odd jobs. In the evenings, he had to rush to fill out the forms sent by various units. Now, the meetings, reports, and documents from above have been reduced, and he can spend almost half of his time going deep into the workshops to understand and solve the problems existing in production.

    In the past, the Shanghai First Light Industry Bureau and its affiliated specialized companies held meetings almost every day, sometimes even two or three meetings at the same time. Hundreds of reports and instruction documents were sent to the factories every month to be filled out. The bureau directors, division chiefs, and company managers and section chiefs were besieged by meetings, reports, and piles of documents all day long. The three thousand-plus new joint operation factories below, most of which were small factories with only a few to dozens of people and unsound organizational structures, meant that these meetings, reports, and documents left the factory directors with very little time to specifically lead production.

    In July of this year, when the First Light Industry Bureau inspected the quality of products in the second quarter, it found that among the fifty-two major products, the quality of twenty products fluctuated or declined; thirty-two of the seventy product quality indicators were not met. After examining the reasons from the leadership aspect, the bureau immediately began to rectify the situation, canceling a batch of documents that could be issued or not, and stopping some meetings that could be held or not, and establishing necessary systems. As a result, in November, the number of meetings was reduced to just over twenty, and the number of reports and documents was reduced by more than half. After getting rid of the situation of staying in the office all day to deal with documents and hold meetings, the First Light Industry Bureau, under the direct leadership of the director, organized working groups to go to twelve factories to investigate their production management and problems, and summarized six experiences in enterprise management. Eighteen managers from eleven specialized companies also went down to eighteen factories respectively within ten days from November 15th to 24th to focus on understanding the production situation and summarizing the experience of leading small factories. In the past two or three months, the three thousand-plus factories below have also concentrated their efforts on conducting a major quality inspection of three hundred products, and have formulated measures to improve product quality in the future. In October, twenty-seven of the forty-five product quality indicators had already improved compared with the second quarter; the situation in November improved even further.

### 突破会议和报表的围困　上海三千多个合营工厂厂长加强具体领导

　　突破会议和报表的围困
　　上海三千多个合营工厂厂长加强具体领导
    新华社上海6日电　新华社记者徐方义报道：上海市第一轻工业局所属三千多个新合营厂的厂长们，最近开始有了更多的时间来领导生产了。
    四个月前，记者曾经访问过公私合营光华制革厂，没有找到公方厂长。人们告诉说，到第一轻工业局或专业公司的会议室去找厂长要容易得多。最近，记者又去访问这个厂，在厂长办公室里没有找到这位厂长，原来他到车间了解生产情况去了。人们这次告诉说，过去，在一个月的二十五个实际工作日里，这位厂长平均有二十天的时间要参加有关单位召开的各种会议，多余的时间只能用来处理一些零星的事务工作。晚上，还要突击填写各单位发来的表报。现在，上面的会议、报表和文件减少了，他差不多有一半的时间可以用来深入车间，了解和解决生产中存在的问题。
    过去，上海市第一轻工业局和所属的专业公司，几乎每天都在召开会议，甚至在同一天里，两三个会议同时进行。一个月发给工厂填写的报表和指示文件等有成百件。局长、处长和公司的经理、科长整天被围困在会议、报表和文件堆里。下面的三千多个新合营厂，绝大部分又都是几个人到几十个人的小厂，组织机构不健全，这些会议、报表和文件使得厂长们很少有时间来具体领导生产。
    今年7月，第一轻工业局检查第二季度产品质量的时候，发现五十二种主要产品中，质量波动和下降的产品有二十种；七十项产品质量指标，有三十二项没有完成。从领导方面来检查原因以后，这个局马上着手整顿，取消了一批可发可不发的文件，停止了一些可开可不开的会议，并且定出必要的制度。因此，11月份会议减少到二十多次，报表和文件减少了一半以上。在摆脱整天停留在办公室里处理文件、召开会议的情况以后，第一轻工业局在局长的直接领导下，组织了工作组到十二个工厂去调查它们的生产管理情况和问题，总结出六条企业管理的经验。十一个专业公司有十八个经理也都在11月15日到24日的十天内，分别下到十八个工厂去重点了解生产情况，总结领导小厂的经验。下面的三千多个工厂在最近两三个月里也集中力量对三百种产品作了一次质量大检查，并且拟订了今后改进产品质量的措施。10月份，在四十五项产品质量指标中，有二十七项指标已经比第二季度提高；11月份的情况更加有了进步。
