    Night Crossing the Qiantang River
    Tang Tiehai
    At the turn of autumn and winter, the days are short and the nights are long. The train had not been far from Shanghai West Station when the fields on both sides of the railway were shrouded in twilight. From dark green to dull brown fields, thin white ribbons crisscrossed. Only when a fish suddenly leaps up does one remember that these are the many rivers, streams, and ditches of the Hangjiahu Plain.
    When I was awakened by the noisy broadcast on the train, we had already arrived in Hangzhou, the "paradise." I have been to Hangzhou three times. The first two times were in early winter. Of course, one could not find "sweet osmanthus in the mountain temple by moonlight," and it was far too early for the beautiful scene of "broken bridge and lingering snow." I only went to Yue Temple to see the chrysanthemums. The last time was in midsummer, when the mercury in the thermometer was climbing step by step past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. I was accompanying two friends from the Indian press from the banks of the Ganges. This time, I didn't even see the chrysanthemums, let alone "resting in the pavilion and watching the tide." I only went to Lingyin Temple's Feilai Peak to pay homage to the memorial pagoda of the Indian monk, asked my Indian friends to decipher the Sanskrit on the stone wall, and then said goodbye to the steaming West Lake and returned. Thinking back, I felt that my visits were ill-timed. And today, I can only pass by Hangzhou in a hurry...
    The train glided gently past the mountains surrounding West Lake, as if afraid to disturb the sweet dream of Xizi. The silhouettes of the mountains receded continuously, and suddenly a blue expanse unfolded in the black night sky. Before I could take a closer look, the train was already traveling on a giant bridge, echoing with empty sounds. Only then did I realize that I was crossing the Qiantang River, where "the river waves diagonally divide Zhejiang into east and west." I had once looked out over the river from Geling and the Six Harmonies Pagoda, quietly watching the trains coming and going, spraying light smoke and whistling, slowly crawling on the iron bridge. It seemed extremely slow, but in reality, the train was roaring along this 1,453-meter-long bridge at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour. The scattered fishing lights in the river streaked across like shooting stars, and rows of bamboo rafts shot past like arrows with the eastward flowing river, drawing deep arcs on the calm river surface. In the northeast, I could see the continuous mountains protruding on the river bay, layer upon layer, brightly lit, with reflections cast on the river water, creating a layer of silver scales, getting farther and farther away, gradually disappearing into the night. This was a night scene of Jiangnan that I had never seen before, an extraordinary artistic conception, a magnificent spirit, which broadened my mind. Looking back to the northwest, the Qiantang River was already submerged in the dim fields, but from a lead-white halo rising from the horizon, one could still imagine the reflection of the river water. This halo was parallel to the horizon, stretching westward, and for a moment it seemed to take me directly to the beautiful banks of the Fuchun River and the Xin'an River.
    The train passed Xiaoshan, which is the intersection of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Hangzhou-Ningbo railways. If I were to change my mind, cross the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and step onto the Hangzhou-Ningbo line, I could return to my hometown, which I have been away from for more than twenty years, back to the Ning-Shao Plain at the foot of the verdant Kuocang Mountains. My hometown in my memory is a place of beautiful mountains and rivers, rich in products; the orchids and bright red nandina growing among the strange rocks and cliffs; the waterfalls pouring down like the Milky Way, the clear streams, the small shrimps jumping in the streams; on the winding little river, groups of pedaled boats passed through stone slab bridges, rushing to see the village opera; in the mountains and valleys, the old revolutionary base areas once had the footprints of my teachers and my childhood playmates, they had victories and sacrifices, and finally persisted through several revolutionary historical periods; all of this was so moving, so vivid, as if it had just happened yesterday. Yes, since ancient times, Siming Mountain and Kuaiji Mountain have produced many heroes. No wonder the Grand Historian Sima Qian traveled thousands of miles to "observe Yu" and included the story of Goujian's restoration of his kingdom in the "Records of the Grand Historian." After being depicted by the realist literary master Lu Xun, the color and style of the hometown were painted even more intensely and prominently. Many people yearned for it and fought for it all their lives.
    The reverie of memories led me to a return of emotions, I was excited, I was sleepy. In a daze, the train smoothly crossed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border through the natural passage of Huaiyu Mountain, and, wearing the morning glow of dawn, entered the hilly area of eastern Jiangxi.

    夜过钱塘江
    唐铁海
    秋冬之交，昼短夜长，列车离上海西站不久，铁路两侧即为暮霭所笼罩。从暗绿色转为昏褐色的田野间，一条条细长的白带子纵横交错。只有当游鱼倏然跃起的时候，才使人想起这是杭嘉湖平原众多的河汊沟渠。
    当我为列车上喧闹的广播声惊醒时，已到天堂的杭州了。杭州我已经来三次，头两次都是孟冬时候，“山寺月中寻桂子”当然是寻不见了，而“断桥残雪”的胜景也远远还太早了一些，只到岳庙去看了看菊花。后一次正是温度计的水银柱越过华氏一百度犹步步上升的仲夏时候，我是给两位来自恒河岸边的印度新闻界朋友做陪客来的。这回连菊花也没看上，更谈不到“郡亭枕上看潮头”了。只到灵隐飞来峰凭吊了一下印度高僧的纪念塔，请印度朋友译解了石壁上的梵文，就辞别冒着热气的西湖回程了。忆想起来，大有去不逢辰之感。而今天，又只能从杭州身边匆匆而过……
    列车轻轻地滑过环抱西湖的群山，好像怕惊破西子的甜梦似的。群山的背影不断地逝去，眼前在黑色的夜空里忽然展开蓝沉沉的一片。我还来不及细看，列车又已经行进在激荡着空旷的回声的巨型桥梁上了。这时我才知道，这是在过“江浪斜界东西浙”的钱塘江了，我曾经在葛岭、在六和塔上远眺过大江，静看东来西往的列车喷着轻烟，鸣着汽笛，缓缓地在铁桥上爬行着，似乎慢极了，可是实际上，列车却是以一小时六十公里的速度，在这长达一千四百五十三公尺的大桥上奔驰吼叫着。江中点点渔火像流星般划过，一排排的竹筏箭似地随着东流的江水飞射过去，在平静的江面划出一道道深邃的弧线。遥见东北突出在江湾上绵亘的山岭，层层叠叠，灯火通明，投影洒落在江水之中，泛起一层银鳞，越来越远，渐渐消失在夜幕中。这是我所从未见过的江南夜景，出奇的意境，雄伟的气魄，胸襟为之大开。回头再往西北看，钱塘江已淹没在昏沉的田野里，但从地平线上升起的一道铅白色的光晕间，还可以使人联想起江水的反照。这光晕和地平线平行着，迤逦西行，一时仿佛直把我带到了美丽的富春江畔、新安江边。
    车过萧山，这里已是浙赣，杭甬铁路交叉点。如果我要改变主意的话，跨下浙赣路，踏上杭甬线，就可以回到阔别二十余年的故乡，回到青葱的括苍山麓的宁绍平原。记忆中的故乡是个山明水秀，物产富饶的好地方；那生长在奇石危崖间的兰花和红艳艳的天竺子；那银河倒泻的飞瀑，透明的涧溪，跳跃在溪水里的小虾；那曲折的小河里，一群群的脚划船穿过一道道的石板桥，赶着去看社戏；那山里山湾里湾的老根据地，曾经有着我的老师，也有我的童年时代的小伙伴们的脚踪，他们有胜利也有牺牲，终于坚持过几个革命历史时期；这一切都是那样动人，那样鲜明，好像在昨天刚发生似的。是呀，自古以来四明山、会稽山上出过多少英雄，怪不得当年太史公也不远千里而来“观禹”，并把勾践复国的故事也采入“史记”。一经过现实主义文学大师鲁迅笔下的描绘，故乡的色彩风貌更被涂抹得浓烈突出，多少人为它神往，为它奋战毕生。
    回忆的遐想，把我引向感情的回流，我激动，我困乏。就在蒙胧中间，列车平稳地从怀玉山的天然孔道中，越过浙赣边界，披着黎明的晨曦，进入赣东丘陵。
