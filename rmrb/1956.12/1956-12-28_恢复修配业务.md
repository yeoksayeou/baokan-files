Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 27th: The Shanghai Medical Equipment Industry Company recently established a service department specifically to handle repair and fitting services.

After the overall industry merged into joint state-private ownership at the beginning of this year, the production tasks of the Shanghai medical equipment industry increased sharply, and most factories stopped their original repair and fitting services, which caused a lot of inconvenience to users. Now the Medical Equipment Company has specifically allocated a portion of its production capacity to specialize in repair and fitting and the manufacture of various special specifications of products required for scientific research.

    恢复修配业务
    据新华社上海27日电　上海市医疗器械工业公司最近新设了一个专门接受修配业务的服务部。
    上海医疗器械工业在今年年初全行业合营以后，生产任务激增，绝大部分厂都停止了原有的修配业务，使用单位感到很多不便。现在医疗器械公司特地划出一部分生产能力，专门进行修配和制造科学研究需用的各种特殊规格的产品。
