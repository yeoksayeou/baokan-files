Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 6th. The last open-hearth furnace to be rebuilt at Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Second Steel Plant produced its first batch of steel on the afternoon of the 5th. With this, all the open-hearth furnaces in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Second Steel Plant, which had been out of production for more than ten years, have been successively equipped with modern technology.

　　The Second Steel Plant was built with outdated technology from the early 20th century before the surrender of Japanese imperialism. Starting in November 1954, the steel plant underwent more than two years of reconstruction. The open-hearth furnaces adopted new automated equipment, and the hearth area was greatly expanded. Several preparatory refining furnaces that could not directly produce steel in the past were also converted into large-scale steelmaking open-hearth furnaces with the help of Soviet experts.

　　The Second Steel Plant after the reconstruction is very large in scale and has a high production capacity.

　　Currently, a socialist competition is underway among the steelworkers of all the open-hearth furnaces in the plant, striving to produce more steel this year despite the lack of raw materials and fuel, and the incomplete status of some piecemeal projects.

    鞍钢第二炼钢厂
　　全部平炉完成改建
    新华社鞍山6日电　鞍山钢铁公司第二炼钢厂最后改建的一座平炉，5日下午炼出了第一炉钢。至此，停产十多年的鞍钢第二炼钢厂的全部平炉，已经先后用近代化的技术装备起来。
    第二炼钢厂是日本帝国主义投降以前用二十世纪初期的陈旧技术建造的。从1954年11月起，这座炼钢厂经过两年多的改建，平炉采用了新式的自动化设备，炉底面积扩大了很多，过去不能直接炼钢的几座预备精炼炉，也在苏联专家帮助下，改为大型炼钢平炉。
    改建以后的第二炼钢厂，规模很大，有高度的生产能力。
    现在，全厂各个平炉的炼钢工人之间，正在开展社会主义竞赛，争取在原料、燃料缺乏，部分零星工程尚未完工的情况下，在今年内生产更多的钢。
