    Comrade Tito's Speech in Pula and Reactions of Communist Parties Around the World

    Tito's Speech in Pula
    Supports the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. Believes the first Soviet intervention was unnecessary. Argues "the cult of personality is actually a product of the system." Divides communist parties of some countries into "Stalinists" and "non-Stalinists." Emphasizes that the current issue is whether the new Yugoslav trend will triumph in communist parties of various countries or the so-called "Stalinist line" will prevail. Calls for certain countries' communist and workers' parties to change their practices. Fiercely criticizes Hoxha's article.

    On November 16th, the Yugoslav newspaper "Borba" published a speech delivered by Comrade Josip Broz Tito, Secretary-General of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, in Pula on November 11th. Tito's speech mainly discussed the Hungarian events and the root causes of the events in Poland and Hungary. He mentioned that Hungarian reactionaries had seized more and more power after the events began, and the atrocities of fascist reactionary thugs killing communist party members. He also criticized the Nagy government for failing to resolutely stop the activities of the reactionaries and expressed support for the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. Tito said, "The Nagy government did nothing to prevent this behavior. It continued to cry for help on the radio without fighting against this behavior, without expressing in some way its determination to stop the slaughter of communists and progressives. It did not do that, but issued a declaration withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact, declaring its independence, and so on." Tito said, "Nagy fled, and a new government was established. ... I know the people in this new government, and it seems to me that they represent the most upright people in Hungary." "We must defend Kadar's current government, we must help it." He also said, "We must oppose all those elements who are now irresponsibly placing all the blame on the Russians."

    When talking about the Soviet army's intervention at the request of the Hungarian government to stop the riots, Tito said that the Soviet's "first intervention was unnecessary." As for the "second Soviet intervention," he said, "We are against intervention, against the use of foreign armed forces. But which is the lesser of the two evils now? Chaos, civil war, counter-revolution, and a new world war, or Soviet intervention? If it is the former, it would be a great disaster; if it is the latter, it would be a mistake. Of course, if doing so can save socialism in Hungary, then, although we are against intervention, we can say that the Soviet intervention is necessary."

    Referring to the relationship between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, he said, "Due to the hopes and initiatives of the Soviet Union, we have restored normal relations with the Soviet Union." "As far as we are concerned, we have made great efforts in our relations with the Soviet Union. We have improved relations, concluded a whole set of economic agreements, which are very beneficial to us and are based on very favorable conditions, and so on." Tito believes that the declarations signed by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in Belgrade and Moscow successively "should have practical significance" for the relations of all socialist countries.

    The last part of Tito's speech denounced the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt. He believes that "this is a typical aggression that is no different from the traditional aggressions launched by colonial countries in the past." "This time, Israel shows that it is a tool of the great powers, and therefore it constitutes a danger to peace." Tito also exposed the face of the French Socialist Party on the issue of aggression against Egypt. He said, "The saddest thing is that the French Socialists have lost face and once again shown that they are loyal servants of those who try to maintain the old, traditional forms of colonialism at all costs."

    In his speech, Tito put forward the argument that "the cult of personality is actually a product of the system," and according to his own views, divided the communist parties of some countries into "Stalinists" and "non-Stalinists." Tito emphasized that the current problem is whether the new trend that actually started in Yugoslavia will triumph in communist parties of various countries, or the so-called "Stalinist line" will triumph. Tito expressed that Yugoslavia will make efforts in all aspects "to ensure the victory of the new spirit." In his speech, Tito also criticized the communist and workers' parties of some Eastern European countries and the French Communist Party, and asked them to change their practices.

    In his speech, Tito also fiercely criticized an article written by Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, believing that this article was criticizing Yugoslavia, although the article did not mention Yugoslavia by name. In an article titled "The Fifteenth Anniversary of the Albanian Labor Party" written by Hoxha in the Soviet "Pravda" on November 8th, he pointed out that the Albanian Labor Party "opposes those who claim to have invented 'new forms' and 'organization' of socialist power, and try their best to impose them on others, advocating the rejection of the Soviet example and experience."

    Comrade Tito's speech has aroused strong reactions and widespread comments among the leading figures of communist parties in socialist countries and some capitalist countries.

    Soviet Union
    TASS introduced the main content of Tito's speech and criticized some of his arguments.

    An article in the editorial department of "Pravda" pointed out some correct assessments of the Hungarian events by Tito, and refuted Tito's arguments on the root of the cult of personality, the role of Yugoslav experience, and the relations between socialist forces. It emphasized the further unity of all socialist forces.

    The Soviet "Pravda" published on November 19th a Belgrade dispatch from TASS on November 17th regarding Tito's speech. This dispatch introduced some of the main contents of Tito's speech, and also criticized some of the arguments in Tito's speech. The dispatch pointed out that it is worth noting that in Tito's speech, some arguments are very incompatible with the statements repeatedly made recently by the leading institutions of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on some basic issues of the international situation, the mutual relations between socialist countries and between communist parties. Some of his words, whether in form or in substance, are contrary to the principles of proletarian internationalism and the international solidarity of the working people.

    On November 23rd, the Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial article entitled: "Strive for the Further Unity of Socialist Forces on the Basis of Marxist-Leninist Principles." The "Pravda" article also analyzed the root causes of the Hungarian events, pointing out that the Soviet Union was fulfilling its internationalist responsibility by helping Hungary to crush the counter-revolutionary conspiracy. The article said, "Among the many reactions to the Hungarian events from abroad, Comrade Tito's recent speech in Pula is the most noteworthy." The article believes that Tito's speech correctly pointed out the provocative role played by the counter-revolutionaries in this event. He sharply criticized the Nagy government. His view that the second Soviet "intervention" was necessary is a correct evaluation of the Hungarian events. When talking about Tito's remarks criticizing the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt and exposing the face of the French Socialist Party on the issue of aggression against Egypt, "Pravda" said, "From this correct assessment, a conclusion can be drawn: all peace-loving people must be vigilant and unite."

    At the same time, the article also raised different opinions on some of Tito's views on the Hungarian events, and refuted Tito's arguments on the root of the cult of personality, the role of Yugoslav experience, and the relations between socialist forces. The article believes that "the cult of personality is extremely incompatible with the entire Soviet socialist system." The article criticized Yugoslavia for accusing other socialist systems, boasting about its own experience, and touting its own experience as possibly the best. The article pointed out that it is groundless to talk about "Stalinists" and "Stalinism." The article also criticized Tito's speech for interfering in the internal affairs of communist parties of various countries.

    The article emphasized, "Everyone understands that for the cause of communist parties in various countries, quarrels are not allowed, turning to mutual attacks and restoring the atmosphere of divergence is not allowed. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union will continue to implement the policy of cooperation between the two parties on the principled Marxist-Leninist basis for the benefit of the brotherly peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and for the cause of defending peace, democracy and socialism. We believe that now we must discuss and clarify the contentious issues in a calm and friendly atmosphere through a comrade-like exchange of opinions." The article concluded, "The Communists of the Soviet Union and the Communists of all countries in the world realize that when the reactionaries launch a fierce offensive against the forces of socialism and democracy, when the imperialists and fascists of many countries launch a crazy attack on the communists, trying to split the international communist movement, all socialist forces must be further united on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles, on the basis of the principles of socialist internationalism." The Czechoslovak "Rude Pravo" commented that many of Tito's evaluations of the Hungarian events are not in line with the clear position of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and other communist parties.

    Prime Minister Siroky believes that he cannot agree that the Yugoslav experience and methods can be declared as a "new line" that other countries should also emulate.

    The Czechoslovak Communist Party's organ newspaper "Rude Pravo" reported on Tito's speech on November 19th. The newspaper commented that there are many unclear things and reservations in Tito's assessment of the Hungarian events. This is not in line with the clear position of our party and other communist parties. We fully cherish the fraternal assistance given to Hungary by the Soviet Union at its request. The newspaper believes that Tito basically did not talk about the role of Western reactionary groups and Hungarian exiles in the events in his entire analysis of the Hungarian events. The newspaper pointed out that some of the words in Tito's speech "actually tend to undermine the internal unity of the socialist countries and the communist parties in capitalist countries, and undermine the unity of the international communist movement." The newspaper said, "Just when these days, when the communists are resolutely stopping the concentrated offensive of the gathered international reactionaries, trying to divide the communist party into what "Stalinists" and other various factions domestically and internationally can only be called harmful to our common cause of communism." The newspaper also criticized the words in Tito's speech that "mean interference in the internal affairs of other communist parties."

    Czechoslovak Prime Minister Siroky said in a speech at the unveiling ceremony of the monument to the late President Gottwald on November 23rd that we cannot agree with certain efforts appearing even in friendly countries like Yugoslavia, that is: thinking that it is their experience and methods that can be declared as a "new line" that other countries should also emulate, or even thinking that they should launch a struggle against representatives of other countries who have different opinions. Siroky said that it is necessary to point out that the principles of equality and non-interference are principles that everyone, including those who so often talk about these principles, must abide by.

    The resolution on the international political situation adopted by the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party at its plenary session on December 5th and 6th raised opinions on Tito's speech. The resolution said, "In addition to some correct conclusions and assessments on the international situation, this speech also includes some other remarks, which the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party unanimously believes are incorrect and not in line with the interests of the international communist movement, nor in line with the interests of communist parties and workers' parties of various countries." The resolution said, we certainly cannot agree with the practice of dividing communist parties and their leading institutions according to some "trend." This is obviously interfering in the internal affairs of these parties. This division also has an impact on the international unity of the communist movement. The resolution believes that Tito's speech's presentation of the issue of the cult of personality is also incorrect. The resolution said that it is also very clear that any effort to take certain specific forms and trends of socialist construction as "models" that are universally valid for other countries is contrary to Leninism and the international experience of the workers' movement. The resolution said that we creatively apply the rich experience accumulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the struggle to build the first socialist country in human history, which has been tested in practice many times. At the same time, we also carefully absorb and will continue to absorb and adopt the experience of building socialism in all socialist countries and fraternal parties.

    We will also strive to constantly deepen and strengthen the friendly and comradely relations with the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, and objectively discuss and clarify all issues that are important to both sides. The basis of our mutual relations will always be the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and the interests of the people of our two countries and the entire international communist movement.

    Italy
    Togliatti said that some of Tito's arguments are consistent with the Italian Communist Party, while on other issues, the Italian Communist Party's estimates are more cautious and prudent.

    The "Unità" editorial pointed out that the key issue is not to forget that proletarian internationalism is the great strength of the socialist camp.

    The Italian newspaper "Unità" published on November 19th a speech by Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti at a party congress in Bologna. When talking about Tito's speech, Togliatti said that "some of the arguments in this speech are consistent with our views, while on other issues, our estimates are more cautious and prudent." When talking about the Hungarian events, Togliatti believes that the mistakes made by the Hungarian party leaders in the past and the complete disintegration of the party later were the decisive reasons for this event. Later, the reactionary forces took the opportunity to infiltrate the gap created in this way, and the situation became chaotic. Togliatti believes that in the initial period, both sides of the confrontation had the strength of workers and the people. However, "the participation of workers' forces is not enough to make a movement revolutionary, because to be revolutionary, these forces must be led by a targeted revolutionary force." When talking about the issue of the Soviet army assisting the Hungarian government in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots, Togliatti said that the Italian Communist Party believes that the first intervention of the Soviet army was "a distressing fact."

    "This intervention could and should have been avoided, and the fact of the intervention should mainly be attributed to the chaos in the ranks of the Hungarian party." He then said, "The second intervention was inevitable and strictly necessary, not only because of the situation formed in Hungary, but also because of the impact that these events and foreseeable developments might have on the entire European and world situation." Regarding the former Nagy government, Togliatti said that our judgment is mostly consistent with the judgment made by Comrade Tito. Togliatti believes that "people's democratic countries should democratize the internal life of the party and state organizations, should establish better connections between leaders and the masses, and each country should follow its own national road of building socialism, so as to meet the needs that appear in different ways in a country." He expressed his belief that the courage shown by the Soviet comrades at the 20th Congress of the CPSU will definitely help correct the mistakes made by communist parties in all countries in leadership. He believes that one should not retreat in the face of the criticisms made at the 20th Congress.

    The Italian Communist Party's organ newspaper "Unità" published an editorial on November 25th entitled "Proletarian Internationalism," saying, "There are discussions, disputes, and criticisms within the socialist camp. We have no reason to be surprised and excessively worried about this." "The Yugoslav comrades have made their judgments on the Hungarian events. In their judgments, they agree that it was necessary for the Soviet Union to carry out the second intervention to save socialism from the threat of counter-revolution. Their judgments can be discussed. ... However, before deeply analyzing these judgments, it must be believed that these judgments should avoid endangering proletarian internationalism by intentionally treating communist parties of various countries and socialist countries differently." The newspaper also said, "The key issue is not to forget that proletarian internationalism is the great strength of the socialist camp. Whoever leaves proletarian internationalism risks weakening this camp, and risks making the masses of their own party and their own country abandon the great driving force of socialism."

    German Democratic Republic
    "Neues Deutschland" publishes a letter from an old German worker party member, criticizing Tito's remarks about "Stalinism."

    The Central Organ of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany "Neues Deutschland" published a letter from a reader written by an old worker party member on November 20th, focusing on criticizing Tito's remarks about "Stalinism" in his speech. The letter wrote: I fundamentally oppose this distinction between "Stalinists" and "non-Stalinists." I only know that this term comes from the propaganda of class enemies. He pointed out: If various factions are divided within and between fraternal parties, it will only bring chaos and damage, and there will be no benefit at all. He said: The mistakes caused by the cult of personality of Stalin once greatly stimulated and shocked him, but what Stalin did was not entirely wrong. "Therefore, I think the term 'Stalinist' and 'non-Stalinist' is completely wrong and harmful."

    France
    Guyot, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, said that the attitude towards the Soviet Union and the CPSU is a matter of principle, and leaving it will weaken and endanger the international communist movement.

    French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez said that the unity between communist parties of various countries is particularly needed at present. He does not think Tito has any reason to draw a dividing line between parties of various countries. The international workers' movement cannot have several centers.

    Raymond Guyot, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, also talked about Tito's speech in the political report he made at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, which began on November 20th. Guyot pointed out that Tito's denunciation of Mollet and the French Socialist Party's war policies in Egypt and Algeria in his speech was "very correct." When talking about the Soviet army's assistance in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion at the request of the Hungarian government, Guyot pointed out that some people expressed displeasure at this, and even suspected that others' support for the Soviet Union and the Soviet army's actions was a manifestation of submissiveness or rejection of the "de-Stalinization movement" and rejection of the "liberalization movement." He said that this is not in line with proletarian internationalism, because the attitude towards the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a matter of principle, and leaving this principle will weaken and endanger the international workers' movement and the communist movement. He expressed that the French Communist Party fully agrees with this approach of the Soviet Union, believing that this is its natural responsibility to the Hungarian working class and the proletarians of all countries. Guyot expressed his disagreement with Tito's statement of the "Yugoslav political line." He said: "As far as we are concerned, there is no Yugoslav political line. There is only the Marxist-Leninist line, and the center of everything is the great Soviet experience." Guyot also criticized Tito for interfering in the internal life of other parties. He pointed out that Tito attacked the leaders of some parties, and described the parties of some countries as "conservative Stalinists," while on the other hand, he listed the parties of Yugoslavia and some other countries as parties that advocate "democratization." He said: "All of this is a very bad thing done when the class struggle in the international arena is particularly difficult."

    French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez also talked about Tito's speech in his closing remarks at the end of the meeting. Thorez said: In the current situation, what is particularly needed is the unity between communist parties of various countries. Therefore, we do not think Tito has any reason to draw a dividing line between parties of various countries. Thorez then talked about the fact that some people are now saying that the Yugoslav road to socialism is the only correct road. He said that this statement runs counter to the theory that countries can have different roads to the transition to socialism. He pointed out: The difference in the form of transition does not involve the content of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which must be common. Its model was in the past and remains the Soviet Union. Thorez expressed his disagreement with the argument about "multiple centers." He said: The French Party will continue to pay close attention to the experience of the Soviet Party. We believe that the international workers' movement cannot have several centers, otherwise, this movement will disintegrate. Thorez also disagreed with the statement about "Stalinism." He said: "There is no Stalinism. This term is something in the vocabulary of our enemies." Thorez then criticized Tito and some Yugoslav newspapers for the satire and attacks on the French Communist Party.

    Albania
    The "People's Voice" editorial said that Tito and the Yugoslav leaders treat Albania with a chauvinistic and anti-Marxist attitude.

    The Albanian Labor Party's organ newspaper "People's Voice" published an article in the editorial department on November 23rd. The article believes that Tito's speech exposed some of his views that contradict Marxism-Leninism, proletarian internationalism, and the international solidarity of the working people. The article disagrees with some of Tito's analyses of the Hungarian events, and emphasized that Tito in his speech very nervously argued with those who think that Yugoslavia's influence promoted the preparation of the Hungarian events. But there is no need to be uneasy for those who have a clear conscience. When talking about Albanian-Yugoslav relations, the article pointed out that Tito and the Yugoslav leaders treat Albania with a chauvinistic and anti-Marxist attitude, and constantly and rudely interfere in the internal affairs of its party and country before and after Albania's liberation. The article said, "The friendship between our people and the fraternal people of Yugoslavia, their common struggle, and common interests require an end to this interference." The article concluded, "Our party, nurtured by proletarian internationalism, will continue to strengthen its friendship with the Soviet Union, other countries in the socialist camp, and all progressive forces in the world."

    Poland
    "Free Tribune" carried an article saying that Poland accepts the desire for Poland and Yugoslavia to strengthen unity, but said that this does not mean that Poland fully accepts Yugoslav-style socialism.

    Polish newspapers published detailed summaries of Tito's speech on November 16th. The Polish United Workers' Party's organ newspaper "People's Tribune" did not publish any comments. The Polish United Workers' Party's organ publication "Free Tribune" weekly published an article on November 25th saying that Tito's speech has attracted the attention of international public opinion, and he has raised discussions on the views of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other fraternal parties on the international situation. The article quoted Tito as saying that there are forces within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that tend towards the Stalinist approach, and that communist parties in various countries have two tendencies towards the events in Poland and Hungary: Stalinist and anti-Stalinist. The article said that Tito condemned the Stalinist attitude towards revolutions within some communist parties. When talking about Tito's assessment of the Hungarian events, the article said that it is not difficult to see that many of the opinions in this evaluation of the Hungarian events are the same as Poland's evaluation of Hungary. The article said that Tito correctly believes that the Yugoslav people should unite more closely with the Polish government and party on the basis of the Polish events. We accept this desire to cooperate with us like brothers, but we must also state that this does not mean that we fully accept Yugoslav-style socialism. Similarly, internationalism does not prevent us from building socialism according to our own specific conditions.

    Yugoslavia
    "Borba" believes that "Pravda's" comments distorted Tito's words. It also said that the Soviet declaration is a positive starting point for the further development of relations between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

    The organ newspaper of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, "Borba," published an article on November 27th, commenting on the editorial article in "Pravda." "Borba" disagreed with "Pravda's" comments and believes that Tito's words were distorted. "Borba" defended Yugoslavia's experience in building socialism. "Borba" emphasized that the Soviet leadership gave an affirmative answer in the recently published declaration on the question of how relations between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries should be. "Borba" said that despite all the shortcomings, "the Soviet declaration on relations between socialist countries is still a positive starting point for the further development of relations between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries." "Borba" emphasized that the issue is practice.

    Bulgaria
    "Rabotnichesko Delo" believes that some of Tito's views are obviously contrary to Marxist-Leninist principles and international communist unity.

    The Bulgarian Communist Party's organ newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" stated in its November 27th editorial that, apart from certain correct evaluations of the British, French, and Israeli aggression against Egypt and the shameful role of the French Socialist Party in this aggression, Tito in his speech also has some views that are obviously contrary to Marxist-Leninist principles, proletarian internationalism, and international communist unity. The editorial believes that some of Tito's evaluations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in his speech do not conform to reality. The editorial said that the Bulgarian Communist Party "firmly opposes any dubious activities that smuggle obviously anti-Marxist and anti-Leninist theories in the form of a 'special road'." The editorial emphasized that "we will always believe that the Soviet experience is a model for the creative application of Marxism-Leninism." The editorial also criticized Tito's remarks in his speech dividing the communist and workers' parties of some countries into so-called "Stalinists" and "non-Stalinists," condemning these remarks as a crude interference in the internal affairs of other fraternal parties and fraternal countries. The editorial emphasized that now, when international reactionary forces are doing everything possible to split the socialist forces, our most important internationalist obligation is to strive to consolidate the unity of the international communist workers' movement on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles.

    Mongolia
    "Unen" believes that some of Tito's conclusions are correct, but overemphasizing the Yugoslav road will bring harm to the world workers' movement.

    The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party's organ newspaper "Unen" published an article on December 1st. The article pointed out that Tito's speech made some correct conclusions on the international situation, but it also contained some incomprehensible, contradictory, and in some respects incorrect assertions. The article said that the Soviet army's aid to Hungary saved the socialist camp and the people of the world from the threat of a new war. The article also believes that overemphasizing the significance of the Yugoslav road to socialism will bring harm to the world workers' movement. This proves that Tito lacks humility. The article said that countries building socialism should learn from each other's experiences and should not blindly imitate. The article concluded that Tito's speech actually made various attacks on fraternal parties and also carried out artificial divisions of the communist movement.

    铁托同志在普拉发表的演说和各国共产党的反应
    铁托在普拉发表演说
    支持匈牙利工农革命政府。认为苏军第一次干涉是不必要的。认为“个人崇拜实际上是一种制度的产物”。把一些国家的共产主义政党分为“斯大林主义者”和“非斯大林主义者”。强调现在的问题是南斯拉夫新趋向在各国共产党内得胜还是所谓“斯大林主义路线”得胜。要某些国家共产党和工人党改变作法。激烈批评霍查的文章。
    新华社10日讯　11月16日，南斯拉夫“战斗报”发表了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟总书记约·布·铁托同志11月11日在普拉发表的一篇演说。铁托这篇演说大部分是谈论匈牙利事件以及在波兰和匈牙利所发生的事件的根源。他谈到了匈牙利反动分子在事件开始后掌握了越来越大的权力，谈到了法西斯反动暴徒杀害共产党员的暴行。他还批评了纳吉政府不坚决起来制止反动分子的活动，并且对匈牙利工农革命政府表示了支持。铁托说，“纳吉政府并没有做什么事情来防止这种行为。它继续在电台上哭哭啼啼呼救，而没有对这种行为展开斗争，用某种方式表示要制止屠杀共产党员和进步人士的决心。它没有那样做，却发表了一篇宣言，在宣言中退出了华沙条约，宣布自己的独立等等。”铁托说，“纳吉逃跑了，同时一个新政府建立了。……我知道这个新政府的人员，并且据我看来，他们代表的是匈牙利最正直的人”。“我们必须保卫卡达尔的现政府，我们必须帮助它”。他又说，“我们必须反对所有那些现在正在不负责任地把全部责任都归咎于俄国人的分子”。
    在谈到苏联军队应匈牙利政府请求来制止暴乱的时候，铁托说，苏联的“第一次干涉是不必要的”。至于“苏军的第二次干涉”，他说，“我们反对干涉，反对使用外国的武装部队。可是现在那一种的坏处比较少一些呢？是混乱、内战、反革命和一次新的世界大战呢，还是苏军的干涉？如果是前者的话，那会是一次大灾难；如果是后者的话，那会是一种错误。当然，假如那样做可以挽救匈牙利的社会主义，那末，虽然我们反对干涉，我们可以说，苏军的干涉是必要的”。
    谈到南斯拉夫同苏联的关系时，他说，“由于苏联的希望和倡议，我们同苏联恢复了正常关系”。“就我们而论，我们在同苏联的关系方面已经作了很大的努力。我们已经改善了关系，缔结了一整套的经济协议，这些协议对我们很有益，是根据非常有利的条件，等等”。铁托认为，苏南两国先后在贝尔格莱德和莫斯科签署的宣言，对所有社会主义国家的关系“应该有实际的意义”。
    铁托演说的最后一部分斥责了英、法和以色列对埃及的侵略，他认为，“这是同殖民国家过去发动的传统侵略没有任何区别的典型侵略”。“这次以色列表明它是大国的一个工具，因此它构成了对和平的危险”。铁托并且揭露了法国社会党在侵略埃及问题上的面目。他说，“最悲哀的是法国社会党人丢了脸，并且再度表明他们是那些企图不惜任何代价来保持旧的、传统形式的殖民主义的人们的忠实的仆从”。
    铁托在演说中提出了“个人崇拜实际上是一种制度的产物”的论点，并且按他自己的看法，把一些国家的共产主义政党分为“斯大林主义者”和“非斯大林主义者”。铁托强调，现在的问题是：是实际上在南斯拉夫开始的新趋向在各国共产党内得胜，还是所谓“斯大林主义路线”得胜。铁托表示，南斯拉夫将在各方面进行努力，“以求保证新的精神获得胜利”。铁托在演说中还批评了东欧某些国家的共产党和工人党以及法国共产党，并且要它们改变作法。
    铁托在演说中还激烈地批评阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记恩维尔·霍查所写的一篇文章，他认为这篇文章是针对南斯拉夫提出批评的，虽然这篇文章中没有提到南斯拉夫的名字。霍查在11月8日在苏联“真理报”上写的题为“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的十五周年”的一篇文章中，曾经指出阿尔巴尼亚劳动党“反对这样一些人，他们自命发明了社会主义政权的‘新的形式’和‘组织’，并且极力把它们强加给别人，鼓吹拒绝苏联的榜样和经验”。
    铁托同志这篇演说在社会主义各国和一些资本主义国家的共产党的领导人士中，引起强烈的反应和广泛的评论。
    苏联
    塔斯社介绍了铁托演说的主要内容，对他的一些论点提出批评。
    “真理报”编辑部的文章指出了铁托对匈牙利事件的一些正确估计，反驳了铁托关于个人崇拜的根源、南斯拉夫经验的作用、社会主义力量之间的关系等问题的论点。强调一切社会主义力量进一步团结起来。
    苏联“真理报”在11月19日刊载了塔斯社11月17日一篇关于铁托演说的贝尔格莱德通讯。这篇通讯介绍了铁托演说的一些主要内容，同时也对铁托演说中的一些论点提出批评。通讯指出，值得注意的是，在铁托的演说中，有一些论点同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导机构最近就国际局势、社会主义国家之间和共产党之间的互相关系的一些基本问题所屡次提出的说法是十分格格不入的。在他的演说中有一些话，不论从形式上或者是从实质上来看，都是同无产阶级国际主义和劳动人民国际团结的原则相违背的。
    11月23日，苏联“真理报”发表了它的编辑部的一篇文章，题目是：“争取社会主义力量在马克思列宁主义原则基础上进一步团结起来”。“真理报”的文章也分析了匈牙利事件的根源，指出苏联帮助匈牙利粉碎反革命阴谋是在尽自己的国际主义的责任。文章说，“在外国对匈牙利事件的许多反应中，铁托同志最近在普拉的演说是最令人注意的”。文章认为，铁托的演说正确地指出了反革命分子在这个事件中所起的挑衅作用。他尖锐地批评了纳吉政府。他认为苏联第二次“干涉”是必要的看法，是对匈牙利事件的正确评价。在谈到铁托抨击英、法、以侵略埃及和揭露法国社会党在侵略埃及问题上的面目的言论时，“真理报”说，“从这个正确估计中可以得出这样一个结论：一切爱好和平的人民必须提高警惕和团结一致”。
    同时，文章还对铁托对于匈牙利事件的一些看法提出了不同的意见，反驳了铁托关于个人崇拜的根源、南斯拉夫经验的作用、社会主义力量之间的关系等问题的论点。文章认为，“个人崇拜是同整个苏维埃社会主义制度极其格格不入的”。文章批评了南斯拉夫方面指责别国社会主义制度、夸耀自己的经验、把自己的经验吹嘘为可能是最优良的经验等作法。文章指出，谈论什么“斯大林主义者”和“斯大林主义”是毫无根据的。文章还批评铁托的演说干涉各国共产党的内部事务。
    文章强调说，“谁都明白，为了各国共产党的事业，不容许发生争吵，不容许转向互相攻击和恢复分歧的气氛。苏联共产党为了苏联和南斯拉夫两国兄弟人民的利益，为了保卫和平、民主和社会主义的事业，今后仍将执行两党在原则性的马克思列宁主义基础上的合作政策。我们认为，现在必须本着在平心静气的友好的气氛中，通过同志式地交换意见的方式来讨论和澄清争执问题。”文章最后说，“苏联共产党人和世界各国共产党人都意识到，当反动派对社会主义和民主力量发动激烈的攻势的时候，当许多国家的帝国主义者和法西斯分子对共产党人展开疯狂的进攻，企图分裂国际共产主义运动的时候，一切社会主义力量必须在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上、在社会主义国际主义原则的基础上进一步团结起来。”捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”评论认为铁托对匈牙利事件的许多估价同捷共和其他共产党明确的立场不相合。
    西罗基总理认为不能同意南斯拉夫的经验、方法可以宣布为其他国家也应该仿效的某种“新路线”。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报“红色权利报”11月19日报道了铁托的演说。这家报纸评论说，铁托在匈牙利事件的估价中有许多不明白的东西和保留。这是同我们党和其他共产党明确的立场不相合的。我们充分地珍重苏联根据请求给予匈牙利的兄弟般的帮助。这家报纸认为，铁托在对匈牙利事件的整个分析中基本上没有谈到西方反动集团和匈牙利国外流亡者在事件中的作用。报纸指出，铁托在演说中所说的一些话“在实际上趋于破坏社会主义国家和资本主义国家中共产党的内部团结，破坏国际共产主义运动的团结”。这家报纸说，“正当在这些日子里，在共产党人坚决地制止纠合起来的国际反动派集中的进攻的时候，试图在国内和国际范围内把共产党划分为什么“斯大林主义者”和其他各种派别，这只能被称为有害于我们共产主义的共同事业的”。这家报纸还批评了铁托演说中“意味着干涉其它共产党内部事务”的话。
    捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基11月23日在故总统哥特瓦尔德纪念碑揭幕典礼上发表的演说中说，我们不能同意那怕是在像南斯拉夫这样的友好国家内出现的某些努力，这就是：认为正是他们的经验、方法可以宣布为其他国家也应该仿效的某种“新路线”，或者甚至以为应该对其他国家的抱有不同意见的代表展开斗争。西罗基说，有必要指出，平等和互不干涉的原则是每一个、包括如此经常地谈到这些原则的人在内所必须遵守的。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会在12月5日和6日全体会议上通过的关于国际政治局势的决议中，提出了对铁托演说的意见。决议说，“这篇演说除了就国际局势提出了一些正确的结论和估计以外，还包括另外一些言论，这些言论捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会一致认为是不正确的，而且是不符合国际共产主义运动的利益，不符合各国共产党和工人党的利益的。”决议说，我们肯定不能同意根据某种“趋向”把共产党和他们的领导机构加以划分的那种作法。这显然是干涉这些党的内部事务。这种划分也对共产主义运动的国际团结有影响。决议认为铁托的演说里对于个人崇拜问题的提法也是不正确的。决议说，也很显然，要把社会主义建设的某些特定的形式和趋向来作为对其他国家普遍有效的“典范”的任何努力，都是同列宁主义和工人阶级运动的国际经验相抵触的。决议说，我们对苏联共产党在建设人类历史上第一个社会主义国家的斗争中所积累起来的经过多次实际考验的丰富经验加以创造性的运用。同时我们也仔细地吸收、并且还要进一步继续吸收和采用一切社会主义国家和兄弟党建设社会主义的经验。
    我们还要努力来不断加深和加强同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的友好和同志关系，来客观地讨论和澄清对双方都很重要的一切问题。我们之间相互关系的基础，将永远是马克思列宁主义的教导和我们两国人民和整个国际共产主义运动的利益。
    意大利
    陶里亚蒂说，铁托的有些论点和意共一致，而在另一些问题上，意共的估计则比较持重和审慎。
    “团结报”社论指出，关键问题在于不要忘记无产阶级国际主义是社会主义阵营的伟大力量。
    意大利“团结报”11月19日发表了意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在波伦亚省的一次党代表大会上发表的演说。陶里亚蒂在谈到铁托演说时说，这个演说中“有些论点是同我们看法一致的，而在另一些问题上，我们的估计则比较持重和审慎”。在谈到匈牙利事件时，陶里亚蒂认为，匈牙利的党的领袖们以前所犯的错误和以后党的完全瓦解是造成这一事件的决定性的原因。后来，反动势力乘机渗入这样造成的裂口，局势就此混乱了。陶里亚蒂认为，在最初一个时期，对峙的双方都有工人和人民的力量。但是，“有工人力量参加不足以使一个运动具有革命性质，因为，要具有革命性质，这些力量必须有一个有目标的革命力量来领导。”在谈到苏联军队协助匈牙利政府镇压反革命暴乱的问题时，陶里亚蒂说，意大利共产党认为，苏军的第一次干涉是“一个令人痛心的事实”。
    “这种干涉是能够而且应该避免的，干涉的事实主要应由匈牙利的党的队伍中发生的混乱情况负责。”他接着又说，“第二次干涉是不可避免的严格的必要的，这不仅是由于在匈牙利形成的局势，而且也是由于这些事件以及可以预见到的发展可能对整个欧洲和全世界的局势产生的影响”。对于前纳吉政府，陶里亚蒂说，我们的判断大部分同铁托同志所作的判断是一致的。陶里亚蒂认为，“人民民主国家应该进行党和国家组织内部生活的民主化，应该建立领袖和群众间的更好的联系，每一个国家都要遵循建设社会主义的民族道路，从而满足在一个国家以不同方式出现的需要。”他表示相信：苏联同志在苏共第二十次代表大会上表现出的勇气必定有利于纠正所有各国共产党在领导方面所犯的错误。他认为，不应该在第二十次代表大会所作出的批评面前退却。
    意大利共产党机关报“团结报”11月25日以“无产阶级国际主义”为题发表社论说，“在社会主义阵营内部有讨论、有争论、也有批评，我们没有任何理由对此感到惊奇和过分的忧虑”。“南斯拉夫同志们已经对匈牙利事件提出他们的判断，他们在判断中是同意苏联有必要进行第二次干涉来从反革命威胁中拯救社会主义的。对于他们的判断是可以加以讨论的。……但是，在深入分析这些判断之前，必须认为这些判断应该避免由于对各国共产党、对各个社会主义国家有意加以区别对待，而危害到无产阶级国际主义。”这家报纸还说，“关键问题在于不要忘记无产阶级国际主义是社会主义阵营的伟大力量。谁要是离开无产阶级国际主义就有削弱这个阵营的危险，而且有使得自己的党和自己国家的人民群众放弃社会主义伟大动力的危险”。
    德意志民主共和国
    “新德意志报”刊载德国一个老工人党员的来信，批判铁托关于“斯大林主义”的提法。
    德国统一社会党中央机关报“新德意志报”在11月20日发表一个老工人党员写的一封读者来信，着重地批评了铁托演说中关于“斯大林主义”的提法。信中写道：我根本反对这种“斯大林主义者”和
  “非斯大林主义者”的区分，我只知道这种名词是出于阶级敌人的宣传。他指出：如果在各兄弟党内部和各国兄弟党之间分出各种派别，那只会带来混乱和损害，而根本不会有任何好处。他说：对斯大林个人崇拜所产生的错误，曾经使他大受刺激和震动，但是斯大林所作的事情并不完全是错误的。“因此，我认为‘斯大林主义者’和‘非斯大林主义者’的提法是完全错误而有害的。”
    法国
    法共中委居约说，对苏联和苏共的态度是一个原则问题，离开它就会削弱和危害国际共产主义运动。
    法共总书记多列士说，目前特别需要各国共产党间的团结，不认为铁托有理由在各国党之间划一条分界线。国际工人运动不能有几个中心。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员雷蒙·居约在11月20日开始举行的法共中央全会上所作的政治报告中，也谈到了铁托的演说。居约指出，铁托在演说中斥责摩勒和法国社会党人在埃及和阿尔及利亚的战争政策，这是“非常正确的”。在谈到苏军应匈牙利政府的请求协助镇压反革命叛乱时，居约指出，有人对此表示不快，甚至还怀疑别人对苏联和苏军行动的支持是一种卑顺或拒绝“非斯大林化运动”、拒绝“自由化运动”的表现。他说，这是不符合无产阶级国际主义的，因为对苏联和苏联共产党的态度是一个原则问题，离开这个原则就会削弱、危害国际工人运动和共产主义运动。他表示：法国共产党完全赞同苏联的这种作法，认为这是它对匈牙利工人阶级和各国无产者的天然责任。居约表示不同意铁托的“南斯拉夫政治路线”的提法。他说：“对于我们说来，不存在什么南斯拉夫政治路线。只有马克思列宁主义路线，而一切的中心是伟大的苏联经验。”居约还批评铁托干涉其他党的内部生活。他指出，铁托攻击某些党的领袖，并且把一些国家的党说成是“保守的斯大林主义者”，而另一方面，又把南斯拉夫和另外一些国家的党列为拥护“民主化”的党。他说：“这一切都是在国际范围内阶级斗争处于特别困难的时候干出的很坏的事情。”
    法国共产党总书记多列士在这次会议结束时发表的闭幕词中，也谈到了铁托的演说。多列士说：在目前形势下，特别需要的是各国共产党之间的团结，因此，我们不认为铁托有理由来在各国党之间划一条分界线。多列士接着谈到，现在有人说南斯拉夫走向社会主义的道路是唯一正确的道路。他说，这种提法是同各国可以有向社会主义过渡的不同道路的这一理论背道而驰的。他指出：过渡的形式的不同丝毫不牵涉到无产阶级专政的内容，这个内容必然是共同的，它的范例过去是、现在仍然是苏联。多列士表示他不同意关于“多中心”的论点。他说：法国党将继续密切注视苏联党的经验。我们认为国际工人运动不能有几个中心，不然，这个运动就会瓦解。多列士也不同意关于“斯大林主义”的提法。他说：“不存在什么斯大林主义。这个名词是我们敌人的词汇中的东西”。多列士接着批评了铁托和一些南斯拉夫报刊对法国共产党的讽刺和攻击。
    阿尔巴尼亚
    “人民之声报”编辑部发表文章说，铁托和南斯拉夫领导人用沙文主义和反马克思主义的态度对待阿尔巴尼亚。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党机关报“人民之声报”编辑部11月23日发表了一篇文章。文章认为铁托的演说暴露了他的若干和马克思列宁主义、无产阶级国际主义、劳动人民国际团结相矛盾的观点。文章不同意铁托对匈牙利事件的某些分析，并强调指出，铁托在他的演说中很神经质地同那些认为南斯拉夫的影响推动了匈牙利事件的准备工作的人争辩。但是对那问心无愧的人说来这是无需不安的。在谈到阿南关系时，文章指出，铁托和南斯拉夫领导人用沙文主义和反马克思主义的态度对待阿尔巴尼亚，在阿尔巴尼亚解放以前和以后，不断粗暴地干涉它的党和国家的内政。文章说，“我国人民同南斯拉夫兄弟人民的友谊、他们共同的斗争和共同的利益要求结束这种干涉。”文章最后说，“受无产阶级国际主义熏陶的我们的党，今后仍将加强同苏联、同社会主义阵营其他国家以及同世界上全体进步力量的友谊”。波　兰
    “自由论坛”载文说，波兰接受波南加强团结的愿望，但表示这不等于波兰完全接受南斯拉夫式的社会主义。
    波兰的报纸在11月16日登载了铁托演说的详细摘要。波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛报”没有发表评论。波兰统一工人党的机关刊物“自由论坛”周刊在11月25日发表一篇文章说，铁托的演说吸引了国际舆论的注意，他已经就苏联共产党和其他兄弟党对国际情势的观点提出了讨论。这篇文章引述铁托的话说苏联共产党内部有趋向于斯大林方式的力量，说各国共产党对待波兰和匈牙利事件有斯大林式和反斯大林式的两种倾向。文章说，铁托谴责了斯大林式的对待某些共产党内的革命的态度。文章在谈到铁托对匈牙利事件的估计时说，不难看出，对匈牙利事件的这种评价中有许多意见是和波兰对匈牙利的评价相同的。文章说，铁托正确地认为南斯拉夫人民在波兰事件的基础上，应该更紧密地同波兰政府和党团结。我们接受这种愿意同我们兄弟般合作的愿望，但是也要说明，这不等于我们完全接受南斯拉夫式的社会主义。同样的，国际主义并不妨碍我们按自己的具体条件来建设社会主义。
    南斯拉夫
    “战斗报”认为“真理报”的评论歪曲了铁托的话。并说苏联的宣言是苏联同东欧国家之间的关系进一步发展的积极的出发点。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟机关报“战斗报”11月27日发表文章，评论“真理报”编辑部的文章。“战斗报”不同意“真理报”的评论，并认为铁托的话被歪曲了。“战斗报”为南斯拉夫在建设社会主义方面的经验辩护。“战斗报”强调指出，苏联领导在最近发表的宣言中对苏联和东欧国家之间的关系应该怎样这个问题作了肯定的答复。“战斗报”说，尽管有一切缺点，“苏联关于社会主义国家之间的关系的宣言仍然是苏联和东欧国家之间的关系进一步发展的一个积极的出发点”。“战斗报”强调问题在于实践。
    保加利亚
    “工人事业报”认为铁托的一些观点，是同马克思列宁主义原则和国际共产主义团结显然抵触的。
    保加利亚共产党机关报“工人事业报”11月27日的社论指出，铁托在演说中除了对英、法和以色列侵略埃及的事件以及法国社会党在这个侵略中起的可耻作用等作了某些正确的评价以外，还有一些观点是同马克思列宁主义原则、无产阶级国际主义以及国际共产主义团结显然抵触的。社论认为，铁托在他的演说中对苏联共产党作的一些评价是不符合实际情况的。社论说，保加利亚共产党“坚决反对在‘特殊道路’的形式下偷运显然反马克思主义、反列宁主义的理论的任何令人怀疑的活动。”社论强调说，“我们永远认为，苏联的经验是创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的典范。”社论还批评了铁托在他的演说中把一些国家共产党和工人党分成所谓“斯大林主义者”和“非斯大林主义者”的言论，谴责这种言论是对其他兄弟党和兄弟国家内部事务的粗暴干涉。社论强调说，现在，当国际反动势力竭尽全力企图分裂社会主义力量的时候，我们最重要的国际主义义务就是争取在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上巩固国际共产主义工人运动的团结。蒙　古
    “真理报”认为铁托的某些结论是正确的，但过分夸大南斯拉夫的道路，会给世界工人运动带来损害。
    蒙古人民革命党机关报“真理报”在12月1日发表了一篇文章。文章指出，铁托的这篇演说对国际局势作出了一些正确的结论，但是，也包含有一些不能理解的、矛盾的和在某些方面不正确的断言。文章说，苏军援助匈牙利，拯救了社会主义阵营和世界人民免于新战争的威胁。文章还认为，过分夸大南斯拉夫走向社会主义道路的意义，会给世界工人运动带来损害。这证明铁托缺乏谦逊。文章说，建设社会主义的各国应互相学习经验，不应盲目摹仿。文章最后指出，铁托的演说实际上对兄弟党作了各种攻击，还对共产主义运动进行人为的分裂。
