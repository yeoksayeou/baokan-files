Learn to Utilize the Democratic Management System of the Collective Economy
Zheng Yi

Many agricultural production cooperatives have a set of democratic management systems, and some major issues are often handled according to the democratic management system; however, it often happens that democracy is not fully developed, many good opinions of the members cannot be gathered, or even if they are gathered, they cannot be implemented; as a result, the democratic management system becomes a mere formality. What causes this? There are many reasons. An important reason is that the leading cadres of the cooperative lack experience in using the democratic management system. The cadres of the Datuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yutian County, Hebei Province, because they gradually learned to use the system of members' representative assembly and collective leadership, basically implemented the policy of democratic cooperative management, and the cooperative's production management gradually got on the right track. Although the cooperative suffered from waterlogging and wind disasters this year, the more than 34,000 mu of grain crops in the entire cooperative still achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield per mu increasing by 34.7% compared with last year; 95% of the 2,494 households in the entire cooperative increased their income and lived a more prosperous life than in previous years.

How to Hold a Good Members' Representative Assembly

Each production team of the Datuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative has members' representatives. The 146 production teams in the entire cooperative have 146 representatives. The cooperative stipulates that a members' representative assembly should be held every three months. By November, the members' representative assembly had been held four times, discussing and deciding on major issues such as the formulation of cooperative regulations, financial management systems, production plans, reward and punishment measures, labor quotas, and pre-distribution plans. These matters were drafted by the management committee and submitted to the members' representative assembly for detailed discussion and adoption. The various plans and systems were generally practical, fair, and reasonable, and were supported by the members.

The cooperative did not achieve full democracy at the beginning when it came to holding members' representative assemblies. When the first members' representative assembly was held in late January 1956, the cooperative's preparatory committee had drafted the cooperative regulations and preliminary opinions on labor arrangements, production plans, and the establishment of a cooperative affairs management committee, and submitted them to the members' representative assembly for discussion. The meeting only lasted one day, but there were too many topics, and the preparatory committee's reports took up too much time, leaving very little time for discussion, so the representatives did not have enough time to consider the issues; in addition, some cooperative cadres did not respect the representatives' opinions enough, and the cadres immediately "explained" as soon as the representatives raised opinions, making the representatives feel that the leading cadres were not modest, which reduced their enthusiasm for raising opinions. At the same time, some representatives also had a sense of dependence, thinking that "these drafts have been discussed and formulated by the township and cooperative cadres, and they are more thoughtful than we are, so there will be no mistakes, and there is no need to raise opinions," so they did not bother to think about the issues at the meeting. As a result, in addition to electing the management committee and the representatives raising a few opinions on the draft cooperative regulations, major issues such as production plans and labor arrangements were hastily passed without much discussion. After the meeting, the members had many opinions.

The cooperative affairs management committee summarized this lesson, and when it convened the second members' representative meeting in March, it conducted research in advance. They decided that there should be fewer topics, more time for discussion, and that representatives should be given ample time to consider the issues, and that management committee members should listen patiently to the opinions of the members' representatives. The management committee should comprehensively study the various opinions, adopt reasonable opinions, and submit them to the representative assembly for approval, and explain opinions that are not correct enough. This meeting mainly discussed the issue of labor quotas. During the meeting, the management committee spent only one hour giving reports and one day allowing the representatives to fully discuss. During the discussion, the representatives were repeatedly given democratic education, explaining the rights and obligations of the members' representatives and the principles of collective wisdom. As a result, the representatives were very enthusiastic and spoke freely. They put forward many opinions on the draft labor quota prepared by the management committee.

Finally, a total of fifty-six inappropriate farming quotas were revised, thirteen farming quotas were added, and three farming quotas were reduced. After the plan was discussed and approved by the members' representative assembly, the representatives were organized to convey it to the members separately, and the members were organized to discuss it item by item in teams. In this way, the work quotas were mastered by the vast majority of members, which improved the members' awareness of abiding by the system and their enthusiasm for production. After that, the cooperative's leading cadres had preliminary experience in democratic management, and the members' representative assembly was held better and better each time.

How to Implement Collective Leadership

The Datuanjie Agricultural Production Cooperative elected seven people from among the members of the management committee as directors and deputy directors to form a standing committee, responsible for implementing the resolutions of the management committee and managing the daily work of the cooperative. Initially, because the cooperative directors lacked experience in managing large cooperatives, there was no clear division of labor; when work came, some directors made arbitrary decisions; issues that needed to be uniformly stipulated by the entire cooperative were also decided by individuals without authorization, which caused disagreements between cooperative cadres and between teams, bringing many difficulties to the management work. For example, the eighth production team requested to buy two large oxen and asked the cooperative deputy directors Yang Siyuan and Yang Wanlai for instructions. This matter was a relatively major financial expenditure issue for the entire cooperative and had to be discussed and decided by the management committee; however, Yang Siyuan and Yang Wanlai approved the eighth team to buy two large oxen for 420 yuan without authorization, which aroused dissatisfaction among the teams.

After the township party committee discovered this situation, it suggested that the management committee hold a meeting to discuss and criticize this practice of making arbitrary decisions on major issues, emphasizing strict adherence to the principle of collective leadership, and stipulating that all issues that need to be uniformly stipulated by the entire cooperative must be submitted to the management committee for collective discussion and decision.

In this way, the phenomenon of the cooperative directors making arbitrary decisions was overcome. However, the cooperative directors developed a fear of making mistakes and were unwilling to make any decisions. As a result, all matters, regardless of their size, had to be submitted to the management committee for discussion. For example, the cooperative members Liu Feng and others who were responsible for burning bricks requested the deputy director Liang Shuhua, who was in charge of sideline production, to buy cloth to make "shoulder pads" because carrying bricks out of the kiln was both pressing on their shoulders and easily wearing out their clothes. According to the rules of burning kilns, they should be bought; and the expenditure was not large, only a dozen yuan would be enough. The deputy director could have made the decision on such a matter; however, Liang Shuhua never dared to agree, always pushing it off, saying, "Let's study it again!" This matter dragged on for more than three months without being resolved. It was not until a dozen cooperative members responsible for burning bricks said that they were unwilling to do it that Liang Shuhua was forced to raise this issue at the management committee meeting for discussion and resolution. Many problems in the cooperative piled up and could not be resolved in time because no one dared to take responsibility, which caused no small losses to the cooperative's production, and the members had many opinions.

In early October, the cooperative management committee held a series of meetings to review and discuss the issue of leadership. Based on the lessons learned from the past, everyone agreed that in order to run a large cooperative well, it is necessary to implement division of labor with individual responsibility under the principle of collective leadership; otherwise, it will cause chaos in management. Only then did the members of the committee make a clear division of labor. Among the seven standing committee members, one director is responsible for grasping the overall work, two deputy directors manage agricultural production, two deputy directors manage sideline production, one deputy director manages the cooperative's political and ideological education work, and one deputy director grasps women's work. It is stipulated that the management committee holds a meeting once a month, and the standing committee holds a meeting every five days; standing committee members take turns on duty during ordinary times. The team leaders or cooperative members who come to talk about problems are responsible for handling them by the standing committee member on duty. Matters that can be decided by an individual are handled immediately; matters that need to be discussed and decided are raised at the meeting; matters that need to be decided immediately but cannot be decided by an individual can be discussed and decided temporarily with other standing committee members. In this way, other standing committee members can often go deep into the production teams to inspect and guide work, and various matters are also taken care of.

In order to organically combine collective leadership and division of labor with individual responsibility, the scope of authority of each standing committee member was also specifically divided, so that everyone clearly recognizes that failing to take responsibility for the division of labor is also a violation of the principle of collective leadership.

After implementing the system of division of labor with individual responsibility under collective leadership, the work has greatly improved. For example, deputy directors Liang Shuhua and Yang Siyuan, who are in charge of sideline production, listened to the opinions of the cooperative members and actively and responsibly organized manpower and materials, quickly organizing forty-two looms, more than fifty flour mills, twelve rubber-tired carts, a dyeing workshop, and an oil press, and developing sideline production such as weaving, making grass bags, milling flour, transportation, dyeing, and oil extraction.

Because the standing committee members of the management committee can often go deep into the teams to inspect work, understand the situation, and mobilize the cooperative members to put forward rationalization proposals, coupled with the cooperative's various mobilizations and rewards for people who put forward rationalization proposals, the cooperative members put forward more rationalization proposals. For example, cooperative members Zhang Maoxian, Cui Fengyi, and others suggested collecting and storing corn leaves as feed to solve the problem of forage. The cooperative affairs management committee adopted this suggestion and organized all cooperative members to collect corn leaves, totaling one million jin, worth 30,000 yuan. Liu Fenglin, the team leader of the twenty-fourth production team, proposed using rice straw to make mats instead of reed mats for covering stacks; this suggestion alone saved the cooperative more than 4,000 yuan in expenses. As of November 10, the cooperative members had put forward a total of 148 rationalization proposals, of which 111 have been adopted. These suggestions have already or will save a large amount of wealth for the cooperative by increasing production and reducing expenses.

    学会运用集体经济的民主管理制度
    郑毅
    许多农业生产合作社都有一套民主管理制度，一些重大问题也常常根据民主管理的制度办事；但是，常常总是没有能够充分发扬民主，社员许多好的意见不能集中起来，或者集中起来了也不能实行；结果，民主管理制度流于形式主义。这是什么原因造成的呢？原因很多。一个重要的原因，是社的领导干部缺乏运用民主管理制度的经验。河北省玉田县大团结农业生产合作社的干部，由于逐步学会了运用社员代表大会和集体领导的制度，基本上贯彻了民主办社方针，社的生产管理渐渐走上正轨。这个社今年虽然遭受了水涝和风灾，全社三万四千多亩粮食作物仍然获得了丰收，每亩平均产量比去年增加34.7％；全社二千四百九十四户社员，95％增加了收入，过起了比往年更为丰裕的日子。
    怎样开好社员代表大会
    大团结农业生产合作社各个生产组都有社员代表。全社一百四十六个生产小组，就有一百四十六名代表。社里规定每三个月召开一次社员代表大会。到11月，社员代表大会已经召开了四次，讨论和决定了制定社章、财务管理制度、生产计划、奖惩办法、劳动定额和预分方案等重大事情。这些事情，都是由管理委员会拟出草案，提交社员代表大会详细讨论以后通过的。各种方案和制度，大体上都作到了切合实际和公平合理，取得了社员的拥护。
    这个社在召开社员代表大会这件事情上，并不是一开头就作到了充分发扬民主的。在1956年1月下旬召开第一次社员代表大会的时候，社的筹备委员会事先拟出了社章草案和劳力安排、生产计划和建立社务管理委员会的初步意见，提请社员代表大会讨论。会议只开一天，议题却太多，社筹备委员会作报告占用的时间又太长，讨论的时间挤得很短，代表们没有充分的时间考虑问题；加上有些社干部对代表们的意见尊重不够，代表一提意见，干部就马上“解释”，使代表们感到领导干部不虚心，降低了提意见的积极性。同时，有些代表也有一种依赖思想，认为“这些草案都是经过乡、社干部们讨论制定的，比我们想得还周到，不会出错，用不着提意见”，在会上就不去动脑筋考虑问题。结果，这次会除选出了管理委员会和代表们对社章草案提出了几条意见以外，生产计划和劳力安排等重大问题，都没有怎么讨论就草率地通过了。会后，社员们的意见很多。
    社务管理委员会总结了这个教训，在3月间召开第二次社员代表会议的时候，就事先进行了研究。他们决定：议题要少，讨论的时间要多，还要给代表们留出充分的考虑问题的时间，并要求管理委员耐心听取社员代表的意见。管理委员会要把各种意见加以综合研究，合理的意见要采纳，提交代表大会通过，对不够正确的意见也要加以说明。这次大会主要讨论劳动定额问题。开会的时候，管理委员会只用一个钟头的时间作报告，用一天的时间让代表们充分讨论。在讨论当中，反复对代表们进行了民主教育，说明社员代表的权利和义务，讲解了集思广益的道理。这样，代表们积极性很高，都作到了畅所欲言。对管理委员会拟定的劳动定额草案，提出了许多意见。
    最后，共修改了五十六项不妥当的农活定额，增添了十三项农活定额，削减了三项农活定额。方案经过社员代表大会讨论通过以后，又组织代表们分头向社员进行了传达，以队为单位组织社员们逐条讨论。这样，工作定额为广大社员所掌握，提高了社员们遵守制度的自觉性和生产积极性。这以后，社的领导干部有了民主管理的初步经验，社员代表大会一次比一次开得更好了。
    怎样实行集体领导
    大团结农业生产合作社在管理委员会的委员当中，推选出七个人为主任和副主任，组成常务委员会，负责执行管理委员会决议和管理社内的日常工作。最初，由于社主任们都缺乏管理大社的经验，没有明确的分工；工作来了，有的主任就乱当家；需要全社统一规定的问题，也由个人擅自决定，以致社干部与社干部、队与队之间互相有意见，给经营管理工作带来很多困难。例如，第八生产队要求买两头大牛，向社副主任杨思源和杨万来请示。这件事是全社的比较重大的财务开支问题，必须经管理委员会讨论决定；但杨思源和杨万来却擅自批准了第八队用四百二十元买来了两头大牛，引起了各队的不满。
    乡党委会发觉这种情况以后，建议管理委员会开会讨论，批判了这种擅自决定重大问题的做法，强调严格遵守集体领导原则，并规定：凡需要全社统一规定的问题，必须提交管理委员会集体讨论决定。
    这样，社主任擅自作主的现象是克服了。但是，社主任们又产生了怕犯错误的思想，什么事情也不肯当家了。于是，事无大小，一律要提到管理委员会讨论。例如负责烧砖的社员刘凤等十几个人，因为从窑里往外挑砖，既压肩头又容易磨破衣服，向管理副业的副主任梁树华请求买布做“护肩”。按烧窑的规矩是应该给买的；而且开支不大，只用十几元钱就够了。这样的事，本来副主任是完全可以作主的；但是梁树华却一直没敢答应，总是推：“研究研究再说吧！”这件事一直拖了三个多月也没有解决。一直到十几个负责烧砖的社员提出不愿干了，才迫使梁树华把这个问题提到管理委员会会议上讨论解决了。社里的许多问题，都由于没有人敢于负责，堆起来不能及时解决，这给社里的生产造成了不小的损失，社员们意见很多。
    在10月初，社管理委员会连续开会对领导问题进行了检查和讨论。根据过去一段的教训，大家一致认为：要想办好大社，必须在集体领导的原则下实行分工负责；否则，就会造成管理上的混乱。各委员们这才作了明确分工。七个常务委员当中，由主任一人负责掌握全面工作，由两个副主任管理农业生产，两个副主任管理副业生产，一个副主任管理社内的政治思想教育工作，一个副主任掌握妇女工作。规定管理委员会每月召开一次会议，常务委员会五天召开一次会议；平时常务委员轮流值班。各队队长或社员来谈问题，由值班的常务委员负责处理。个人可以决定的就马上处理；需要讨论决定的开会时再提出来；需要马上决定而个人又不能决定的事情，可以和其他常务委员临时碰头商量决定。这样，别的常务委员就可以经常深入各生产队检查和指导工作，各种事情也有人负责了。
    为了使集体领导和分工负责有机地结合起来，还具体划分了各个常务委员的职权范围，使大家明确地认识到：分工而不负责任，同样是违反集体领导原则的行为。
    实行集体领导下的分工负责制以后，工作大有改进。如副主任梁树华和杨思源分工管理副业生产，他们听取了社员们的意见，积极负责组织人力物力，很快地组织起四十二架织布机、五十多座粉房、十二辆胶皮车、一个染房和一个榨房，开展起来了织布、打草袋、磨粉、运输、染布、榨油等副业生产。
    管理委员会的常务委员们，因为能经常深入各队检查工作，了解情况，发动社员提合理化建议，加上社里多方动员，奖励提合理化建议的人，社员提的合理化建议也多起来了。如社员张茂贤、崔凤仪等建议打玉米叶子贮存作饲草，解决饲草问题。社务管理委员会采纳了这个意见，组织全体社员打玉米叶子，共计打了一百万斤，价值三万元。第二十四生产队队长刘凤林提出了用稻草打席子代替苇席苫垛；只这一项建议，就为社节省了四千多元的开支。到11月10日为止，全社社员已提出合理化建议一百四十八件，被采纳的有一百一十一件。这些建议，已经或者将要为社里增产节约大量财富。
