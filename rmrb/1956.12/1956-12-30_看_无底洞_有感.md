    Thoughts on Seeing "The Bottomless Cave"
    Tian Yin
    Wudan (female warrior) operas in Peking Opera have almost disappeared from the stage in recent years.

    Recently, I saw "The Bottomless Cave" performed by the China Peking Opera Theater. I was happy, but also felt quite moved.

    This play is adapted from episodes 80 to 83 of "Journey to the West." It describes how the kind-hearted Tang Sanzang, by saving a life that should not have been saved, ended up causing trouble. This play illustrates that humanitarianism should have principles of right and wrong.

    This is an old play. The comrades of the Peking Opera Theater have processed and reorganized it on the basis of traditional techniques, enriching the plot and making it clear and understandable. The excellent martial arts skills of the Wudan actress have also been appropriately developed. After watching the two-hour performance, I found it very enjoyable, especially the stunts performed by the Wudan actress, such as “Da Chushou” (fighting with thrown weapons), which were even more amazing and exciting.

    But such a good play was rigidly confined by outdated conventions in the past. They said that Wudan operas were all about monster stories and the content was not good. "Da Chushou" was unreasonable: how could enemies exchange weapons in battle? As a result, many Wudan operas could not be performed; many actors who performed Wudan roles changed careers or became unemployed. Li Jinhong, the excellent actor who played "The Bottomless Cave," was buried for six or seven years.

    In fact, Wudan opera is very difficult to perform, and it has a unique artistic style. Wudan is also an indispensable role in Peking Opera. People who perform Wudan must study hard and practice hard, and spend a lot of labor to perform the play well.

    In fact, audiences like Wenxi (civil plays) and also like Wuxi (military plays). In Wuxi, audiences like Wusheng (male warrior), Wujing (painted-face male warrior), and also like Wudan and Wuchou (male comic). It's a pity that in recent years, Wudan and Wuchou have been so undervalued, and the development and improvement of Wuxi has been so small!

    With diversified roles, the repertoire will be rich. Within a genre or a troupe, there should also be "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend!"

    看“无底洞”有感
    田因
    京剧中的武旦戏，近年来几乎绝迹于舞台了。
    最近看了中国京剧院演出的“无底洞”，一面高兴，同时也颇有点感触。
    这出戏，取材于西游记八十回至八十三回的故事。描写具有一副慈悲心肠的唐三藏由于救了一个不应该救的生命，结果反而惹出祸害来。这出戏说明了人道主义应该有原则的是非才对。
    这是出老戏，京剧院的同志们，在传统技术的基础上，进行了加工整理，丰富了故事情节，叫人看的清楚明白。优秀的武旦的武打技术，也适当地给以发展。看了两小时的演出，觉得津津有味，尤其是武旦表演的绝技，打出手，更令人叫绝、兴奋。
    但是这样的好戏，过去硬是被清规戒律禁锢着。说什么武旦戏全是妖怪戏，内容不好。打出手，是不合理的：两敌交锋，怎能还交换兵器呢？结果，许多武旦戏不能上演了；许多演武旦的演员，改行了，失业了。演“无底洞”的优秀演员李金鸿就被埋没了六七年的时间。
    其实，武旦戏是很不好演的，它有独特的艺术风格。武旦也是京剧中万不可少的脚色。演武旦的人，必须苦学苦练，花费巨大的劳动才能把戏演好。
    其实，观众喜爱文戏，也喜爱武戏。在武戏中，观众喜爱武生武净，也喜爱武旦武丑。可惜近年来武旦武丑是那样不被看中，武戏的发展和提高是那样微小！
    角色多样化，剧目才丰富。在一个剧种或一个剧团之内，也应该是“百花齐放，百家争鸣”吧！
