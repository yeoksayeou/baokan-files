    Soviet Care for Mothers
    The Soviet government has recently taken many measures to further improve the working and living conditions of women and help them raise their children.
    The maternity leave for Soviet women has been increased from April 1st of this year to fifty-six days before and after childbirth. Now, additional provisions have been made for extending the leave: women working in enterprises and institutions are entitled to an additional three months of supplementary leave (without pay) after maternity leave. If a woman wants to temporarily leave her job after childbirth, her seniority is still retained within one year.
    Currently, there are eighteen scientific research institutes in the Soviet Union specializing in scientific research on protecting children's health. There are 400,000 pediatricians nationwide, and twenty-three university departments and a specialized school to train these doctors.
    Mothers' rest conditions are also getting better day by day. By the end of next year, eighteen more sanatoriums and rest homes will be opened throughout the Soviet Union, exclusively for pregnant women and mothers with children to enjoy. People with economic difficulties can receive free preferential treatment.
    All Soviet agencies and enterprises will set up nurseries, shower rooms, and women's hygiene rooms, and expand the enterprise's bathrooms, laundry rooms, and other living facilities to reduce the burden on mothers.
    The country's existing nurseries and kindergartens can accommodate more than 2,613,000 children. By 1960, it will increase by 45%. In order to reduce the trouble for parents, the government has decided to establish a new type of child education institution when necessary, that is, an institution that combines nurseries and kindergartens—"child care gardens." This is not only beneficial to the education of preschool children, but also can greatly help mothers, so that their children of different ages can live together.
    Some lower grade primary school students are left unattended after school because their parents go to work. It has now been decided to form special groups for uncared-for children below the fourth grade, and the school will hire instructors to take care of them. These primary school students can eat hot meals at school. Parents with poor economic conditions can also be exempted from fees.

    苏联对母亲的关怀
    苏联政府最近采取了许多措施，进一步改善妇女的劳动条件和生活条件，帮助她们教养子女。
    苏联妇女的产假从今年4月1日起增加为产前产后各五十六天。现在又作了额外延长假期的规定：凡在企业和机关中工作的妇女有权在产假后再多得到三个月的补充假期（不保留薪金）。如果妇女想在产后暂时离开工作岗位的话，在一年之内她的工龄仍然保留。
    目前苏联有十八个科学研究所专门进行关于保护儿童健康的科学研究工作。全国有四十万名小儿科医生，有二十三个高等学校的系和一个专科学校培养这类医生。
    母亲们的休息条件也一天比一天好了。到明年年底，全苏联将再开办十八所疗养院和休养所，专供孕妇和带孩子的母亲享用。经济困难的人可以得到免费的优待。
    苏联各机关和企业中都将设立乳儿室、淋浴室和妇女卫生室，并且要扩大企业的浴室、洗衣室和其他生活设施，以减轻母亲们的负担。
    全国现有的托儿所和幼儿园可以容纳二百六十一万三千多个儿童。到1960年将增加45％。为了减少父母的麻烦，政府已经决定，在必要的情况下，设立新型的儿童教育机构，即托儿所和幼儿园合而为一的机构——“幼儿托养园”。这不仅对学龄前儿童的教育有很多好处，而且可以大大帮助母亲们，使她们的年岁不同的子女能够生活在一起。
    一部分低年级的小学生，放学后因为父母去工作而无人照管。现在决定把四年级以下的缺乏照顾的儿童编成专门的小组，由学校请教养员来照管。这些小学生可以在学校里吃到热饭。经济状况较差的家长还可以免缴费用。　（王）
