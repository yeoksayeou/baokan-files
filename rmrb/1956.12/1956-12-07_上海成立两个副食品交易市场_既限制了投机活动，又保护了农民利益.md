Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th. Shanghai has recently established two free markets for non-staple food trading under state leadership: Dada Wharf and North Station Trading Market. After the establishment of these two markets, various agricultural and sideline products transported from rural areas along the water routes of northern Jiangsu, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line, and southern Anhui are mostly concentrated here for trading.

In recent months, after Shanghai relaxed market management of non-staple foods, the lack of a fixed and centralized trading venue resulted in self-producing and self-selling farmers and transporters conducting transactions at wharves, railway stations, and in streets and alleys near wharves and railway stations. This often led to the discovery of brokers and vendors engaging in deceptive practices such as raising prices, lowering prices unfairly, and using inaccurate scales.

After the establishment of trading markets under state leadership, it became easier to manage, while also restricting the deceptive activities of brokers and peddlers. On one occasion, a farmer brought more than a dozen large silver carps from Zhenjiang. Shortly after getting off the train at Shanghai North Railway Station, he was stopped by an illegal broker who tried to force down the price. The attendant at the North Station Trading Market immediately discovered this and patiently persuaded the farmer to trade at the free market, which resulted in him earning more than ten yuan extra. When trading at the free market, if some goods cannot be sold or prices fall due to an oversupply, state-owned companies will also purchase them at appropriate prices at any time, protecting the interests of farmers and legitimate transporters.

　  上海成立两个副食品交易市场
　　既限制了投机活动，又保护了农民利益
    新华社上海5日电　上海最近成立了两个在国家领导下进行副食品交易的自由市场——大达码头和北站交易市场。这两个市场成立后，从苏北水上航线和沪宁铁路沿线以及皖南等地的农村运来的各种农副产品大都集中在这里进行交易。
    最近几个月来，上海市在放宽对副食品的市场管理后，由于没有一个固定的、集中进行交易的场地，自产自销的农民和贩运者在码头、车站以及靠近码头车站的街头和里弄内进行交易，经常发现掮客、商贩抬价、杀价、缺秤等欺骗行为。
    成立国家领导下的交易市场后，一方面便于管理，同时也限制了掮客、小贩的欺骗活动。有一次，一个农民从镇江带来十多条大鲢鱼，到上海北火车站下车不久，就遇到一个不法掮客上前拦住杀价，立即被北站交易市场的服务员发现，耐心劝导这个农民到自由市场去交易，结果使他多收入了十多元。在自由市场上交易，如果遇到有的货卖不出去或货多价格跌落时，国营公司也随时以适当价格收购，保护农民和正当贩运者的利益。
