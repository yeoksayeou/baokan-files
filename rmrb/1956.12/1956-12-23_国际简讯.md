    Since its release, the film "The True and False Inspector" has been drawing large crowds daily. The first night's two screenings were sold out very early. The "Guanghua Morning Post" reported on the 18th that this was a rare phenomenon for movie ticket sales in Bangkok recently.

The newspaper also believes that the Chinese short films "The Magic Brush" and "The Boastful Frog," which are being screened alongside "The True and False Inspector," are a refreshing treat for audiences accustomed to Western animated films.

    我影片“炼印”受到泰国观众欢迎
    据曼谷消息：继“秦香莲”影片之后，另一部中国摄制的影片“真假巡按”（即“炼印”）已经从17日晚开始在曼谷的“天外天”戏院放映，受到泰国观众的欢迎。
    “真假巡按”影片自从放映以来，连日观众都很拥挤。第一晚放映两场，很早就宣告满座。18日的“光华早报”说，这是曼谷近来影片卖座少有的现象。
    这家报纸赞扬说，“真假巡按”可说是中国戏剧的最好表演。报纸还认为，同“真假巡按”同场放映的中国短片“神笔”和“夸口的青蛙”对于看惯西方动画片的观众说来则是一个清新的享受。
