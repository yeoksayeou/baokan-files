Reader's Letters

    We Need Various Foreign Language Dictionaries

    I.

    Since the Party put forward the call to march towards science, the vast number of intellectuals across the country have been actively learning foreign languages. The supply of foreign language dictionaries in bookstores is very poor. Readers cannot find a Russian-Chinese technical dictionary in bookstores, and even general Russian-Chinese dictionaries are difficult to buy.

    It is hoped that publishing houses will publish various foreign language dictionaries. In addition, pocket dictionaries can be published in the future. This is convenient to carry and uses less paper.

    II.

    People who study foreign languages cannot do without foreign language dictionaries, just as a soldier cannot do without a gun. However, the types of foreign language dictionaries published by publishing houses are very few, especially French dictionaries. As far as we know, the commonly used French dictionary in China now is the "Model French-Chinese Dictionary" published before liberation. Even though the annotations in this dictionary are very simple, it has been sold out. Since various new foreign language dictionaries cannot be compiled immediately, is it possible to reprint the various foreign language dictionaries published before liberation? We urgently hope that the publishing department will pay attention to this issue.

    We Want Good Maps

    Our country is a vast country with abundant resources. Since the founding of New China, the number of newly built cities, mines, and factories has been increasing day by day. However, a provincial map of China recently published by the map publishing house is not detailed, has no instructions, and has many errors, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of the majority of readers. I hope that the publishing department will compile and publish a detailed provincial map of China to meet the needs of the majority of readers.

    Hurry Up and Rescue Historical Archives

    Recently, the articles "Talking About Book Hunting" and "Rescuing Precious Historical Archives as Soon as Possible" published on page eight of the People's Daily have mentioned the damage to many precious historical archives. As far as I know, similar things are not limited to one or two cases. In 1954, I went to the Historical Documents Department of the former Northeast Library (now renamed the Historical Documents Department of the Liaoning Provincial Library) to consult materials and learned that the library also preserved more than 2.4 million historical archives, many of which were very precious. Although these materials have received the attention of the library's负责人 [responsible persons], due to the humid warehouse and poor storage conditions, many have been eroded by water and turned into bricks. When I left the Northeast Library, the director of the Historical Documents Department also sent us one as physical material for studying "File Material Storage Technology." This shows that the damage to historical archives is quite common, and rescuing these archives is indeed an urgent matter. I hope that relevant departments can formulate proper methods for collection and acquisition as soon as possible.

    读者来信
    我们要各种外文字典
    一
    自从党提出向科学进军的号召以后，全国广大知识分子都在积极学习外文。书店里外文字典供应情况很不好。读者到书店找不到一本俄华技术字典，连一般的俄华字典也很难买到。
    希望出版社出版各种外文字典。另外，今后可以出版袖珍本字典。这样携带便利，用纸也少。
                            周国盈
    二
    学习外文的人是不能缺少外文字典的，正如一个战士不能没有枪杆一样。可是，出版社出版的外文字典的种类，寥寥无几，尤其法文字典更少。据我们了解，国内现在常用的法文字典是解放前出版的“模范法华字典”。即使这种字典的注解很简单，也被大家买光了。既然各种新的外文字典不能马上编出来，是否可以重版解放前出版的各种外文字典呢？我们迫切希望出版部门重视这一问题。　马汉金
    我们要好的地图
    我国是一个幅员广大、物产丰富的国家。自从新中国成立以来，新建城市、矿山、工厂日益增加。但是，地图出版社最近出版的一本中国分省地图不详细，又无说明，而且错误的地方也很多，很难满足广大读者的需要。我希望出版部门编制出版一本中国分省详图，以满足广大读者的需要。　吴家驹
    赶快抢救历史档案资料
    最近人民日报八版上发表的“谈访书”、“尽快抢救珍贵的历史档案资料”等文中，都谈到许多珍贵的历史档案资料遭到损害的事情。据我所知，类似的事情并不止此一起两起。1954年我曾去原东北图书馆历史文献部（现改称辽宁省图书馆历史文献部）翻阅资料，了解到该图书馆也保存了二百四十余万件历史档案资料，其中很多是非常珍贵的。这些资料虽受到图书馆负责人的重视，但因库房潮湿和保管条件较差，有不少已经受水浸蚀，变成一块块砖了。我离开东北图书馆时，该馆历史文献部主任还送给我们一块，作为研究“文件材料保管技术学”的实物资料。由此可见历史档案资料被损害的情形是相当普遍的，抢救这些档案资料确是刻不容缓的事情，希望有关部门能及早订出征集和收购的妥善办法。
