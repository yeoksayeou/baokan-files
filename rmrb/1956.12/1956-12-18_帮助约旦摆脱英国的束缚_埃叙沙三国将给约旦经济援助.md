    Helping Jordan Break Free from British Shackles
    Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia to Provide Economic Aid to Jordan
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 17th: According to Cairo Radio's broadcast on the evening of December 16th, the governments of Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia are prepared to guarantee sufficient economic aid to Jordan to enable Jordan to abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty of Alliance of 1948.
    The broadcast stated that the joint statement of the three governments on this issue has been simultaneously published in Cairo, Damascus, and Riyadh.
    According to the provisions of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty, Britain has the right to station troops in Jordan and occupy two air force bases. At the same time, Jordan receives an annual subsidy of 12 million pounds from Britain. Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi announced in November this year that Jordan had decided to abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty. Later, on December 1st, he announced that Jordan would not be able to abolish the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty until Jordan receives economic aid from Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia to replace the British subsidy.

    帮助约旦摆脱英国的束缚
    埃叙沙三国将给约旦经济援助
    新华社17日讯　开罗消息：据开罗电台16日晚广播，埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯三国政府已经准备保证给予约旦足够款项的经济援助，以使约旦能够废除1948年的英国—约旦同盟条约。
    广播说，三国政府关于这个问题的联合声明已经同时在开罗、大马士革和里雅特公布。
    根据英约条约的规定，英国有权在约旦驻军，并且占领两个空军基地，同时约旦每年接受英国所给的一千二百万英镑的津贴。约旦首相纳布西曾经在今年11月间宣布，约旦已经决定废除英约条约。后来他在12月1日又宣布，在约旦从埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯接到经济援助以代替英国的津贴以前，约旦将不能够废除英约条约。
