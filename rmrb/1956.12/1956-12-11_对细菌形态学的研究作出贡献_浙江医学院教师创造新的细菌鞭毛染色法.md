Xinhua News Agency News: Tu Baoqi, professor at Zhejiang Medical College, and Lu Li, lecturer, have developed a simple and easy-to-use bacterial flagella staining method, making a contribution to the study of bacterial morphology. Using this staining method, bacterial flagella can be clearly seen under a microscope. They also proved that past literature records regarding the flagella of Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa do not match the reality.

Bacterial flagella are very thin and must undergo special staining before they can be observed under a microscope. Flagella staining is one of the most difficult staining methods in bacteriology. Although many papers on flagella staining have been published at home and abroad in the past, they have not yielded satisfactory results after trial use. Professor Tu Baoqi and his assistant Lu Li began to study this problem in September this year and found that the reason why flagella staining was not easily successful in the past was that the mordant's mordanting power was insufficient, the flagella easily fell off, and the impurities mixed in the bacteria could not be removed well. Therefore, in this study, they used organic mercury agents such as saturated aqueous solution of phenylmercuric nitrate to fix the bacterial flagella, and removed impurities in the bacteria by natural coagulation. Applying this method to stain the flagella of Proteus and Salmonella, the staining rate reached 100%. Even Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae, which are considered difficult to stain in bacteriology, can be clearly seen. In the past, bacterial science recorded that Pseudomonas aeruginosa had one to three flagella, but it is now found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa has one to five flagella at one end; in the past, it was believed that Vibrio cholerae flagella were thicker than bacilli flagella, but this study found the opposite result.

Applying this method to stain bacteria does not require such complicated and time-consuming procedures in preparation as other methods.

    对细菌形态学的研究作出贡献
    浙江医学院教师创造新的细菌鞭毛染色法
    新华社讯　浙江医学院教授屠宝琦和讲师吕礼，研究出一种简单易行的细菌鞭毛染色法，对于细菌形态学的研究作出了贡献。运用这种染色法，可以在显微镜下清楚地看出细菌的鞭毛。他们并且证明过去文献上关于霍乱弧菌和绿脓杆菌的鞭毛记载，与实际不相符合。
    细菌的鞭毛很细，在观察之前必须经过特殊的染色，然后才能在显微镜下观察。鞭毛的染色法是细菌学上各种染色法中最困难的一种。虽然过去国内外也曾经发表过不少关于鞭毛染色的论文，但是试用之后，都没有圆满的结果。屠宝琦教授和他的助手吕礼从今年9月起开始研究这一问题，发现过去对鞭毛染色不易获得成功的原因是媒染剂的媒染力不够，鞭毛容易脱落，以及混在细菌中的杂质不能很好除净的缘故。因此，在这次研究中，他们就改用硝酸苯汞饱和水溶液等有机汞剂来固定细菌的鞭毛，以及因自然凝固而除去细菌中的杂质。应用这种方法来染色变形杆菌和伤寒杆菌的鞭毛，染出率达到100％。对于细菌学上认为难染色的绿脓杆菌和霍乱弧菌，也能清楚地看出。过去细菌学上所记载的绿脓杆菌的鞭毛是一根到三根，现在发现绿脓杆菌的鞭毛在一端有一根到五根；过去认为霍乱弧菌的鞭毛比杆菌类的鞭毛要粗，这次研究中却发现了相反的结果。
    应用这一方法来染色细菌，在准备工作上也不像其他方法那样手续繁杂、费事。
