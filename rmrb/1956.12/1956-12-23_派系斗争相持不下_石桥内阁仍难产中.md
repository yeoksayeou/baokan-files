    Factional Struggles at a Standstill
    Ishibashi Cabinet Still Unborn
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 22nd: Japan's new Prime Minister, Ishibashi Tanzan, and his cabinet-forming aides, after a full day of intense cabinet formation activities today, finally announced with regret late at night that "the (new cabinet) list cannot be released tonight and will be delayed until tomorrow."
    Kishi Nobusuke, who had indicated yesterday that he agreed to become the new cabinet's Foreign Minister, expressed reluctance today to cooperate with Ishibashi. Kishi Nobusuke's faction believes that half of the Liberal Democratic Party's Diet members support them, and therefore they demand at least six cabinet posts in the new cabinet. However, Ishibashi has not accepted this demand.
    Former Liberal Party member Ishii Mitsujiro is also dissatisfied with Ishibashi's cabinet formation plan. Ishii transferred his votes to Ishibashi when Ishibashi Tanzan and Kishi Nobusuke last competed for the position of President of the Liberal Democratic Party. Ishii's group believes that the new cabinet should be jointly formed by Ishibashi and Ishii, with "Ishibashi as Prime Minister and Ishii as Deputy Prime Minister."

    派系斗争相持不下
    石桥内阁仍难产中
    据新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本新首相石桥湛山和他的组阁助手今天在经过一整天的紧张组阁活动以后，终于在深夜又遗憾地宣布，“今晚不能发表（新内阁）名单，延迟到明天了。”
    昨天一度表示同意出任新内阁外务相的岸信介，今天又表示不愿同石桥合作。岸信介派的人认为，在自由民主党的国会议员中有一半的人支持他们，因此他们要求在新内阁中至少要占六个阁员。但是，石桥一直没有接受这个要求。
    前自由党人石井光次郎也对石桥的组阁方案不满。石井在石桥湛山和岸信介最后竞选自由民主党总裁职位的时候，曾经把他的选票转移给石桥。石井集团的人认为，新内阁应该是由石桥和石井联合组成，“石桥任首相，石井任副首相”。
