    Urgent Like a Shooting Star, Slow Like an Old Ox
    “We must, according to the Party and state's policies and in accordance with the laws of economic development, overcome right-leaning conservative thinking, carefully draft plans, and better guide our work.” This is what the leading cadres of the Zhejiang Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau said when they summoned planning cadres from subordinate units in September of last year to compile the 1956 annual salt industry transport and sales plan. It seems that more than a year has passed since then. Before we know it, 1956 is nearing its end, but the 1956 salt transport and sales plan has not yet been issued. It seems very likely that it will be promulgated in 1957. How can this "better guide the work"?
    Annual plans are like this, quarterly plans are issued at the end of the quarter, which is not an isolated phenomenon; and the requirement for subordinates to compile and report plans is particularly urgent. No wonder the comrades reflect: "Requesting plans is as urgent as a shooting star, approving plans is as slow as an old ox." (Zheng Songqing)

    急如星火，慢如老牛
    “我们要根据党和国家的方针政策，要根据经济发展规律，克服右倾保守思想，认真编好计划，更好地来指导工作”。这是浙江省盐务局的领导干部在去年9月份召集所属单位的计划干部，编制1956年度盐业运销计划时说的一番话，算来到现在已经一年多了。不觉1956年已近尾声，而1956年盐务运销计划还没有下达，看来大有要在1957年颁布的样子。这怎么能“更好地指导工作”呢？
    年计划如此，季计划到季末下达，也不是偶然现象；而要求下面编报计划则特别急，难怪职工同志反映：要计划急如星火，批计划慢如老牛。”（郑颂青）
