    To Mr. Dai You Husheng:
    Your letter from Longtan, dated December 15, has been received. Your intention is appreciated, but unfortunately, it lacks specific details. We hope you can provide the place name, organization name, person's name, and time one by one; otherwise, it will be impossible to handle. A reply is expected.
　Yan

    代邮呼声先生：
    12月15日龙潭邮信收到。你的用意很可感，可惜没有具体写明。希望把地名、机关名、人名、时间一一开示，否则无从处理。盼邮复。
