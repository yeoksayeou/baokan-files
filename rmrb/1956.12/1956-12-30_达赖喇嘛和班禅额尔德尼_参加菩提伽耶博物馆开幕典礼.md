Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 29th: The Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni attended the opening ceremony of the local museum in Bodh Gaya on the afternoon of the 28th. The Dalai Lama also cut the ribbon for the museum. This museum was established by the Indian government to store antiquities unearthed nearby.

About 600 people attended the opening ceremony, including Bihar State Governor Diwakar, officials from various parts of Bihar, and social celebrities.

In a speech amid applause, the Dalai Lama said that Bodh Gaya, as one of the four largest Buddhist centers, urgently needs a place to preserve the antiquities excavated by the archaeological department. He praised the necessary steps taken by the Indian government in this regard.

Bihar State Governor Diwakar, who presided over the ceremony, recounted the history of the development of Bodh Gaya. He said that the people here feel very fortunate that the Dalai Lama and Panchen can attend the opening ceremony of the museum here.

The Dalai Lama also visited the Tibetan monastery located next to the Bodh Gaya Temple. He was greeted in the Tibetan manner by several lamas who had settled here. They presented him with many Hadas.

In the morning, the Dalai Lama and his entourage chanted scriptures in the Bodh Gaya Temple and prayed for blessings for the temple and the holy statues. Candlelight illuminated the Bodh Gaya Temple. One hundred lamas from famous temples in Tibet, China, stood on both sides, holding temple banners and playing musical instruments such as "Dunba."

On the same morning, Panchen and his party traveled by jeep across the Pagu River to the Donggeslei Cave, where Buddha had meditated for six years before attaining enlightenment. Panchen chanted scriptures in the temple outside the cave.

Nearly 20,000 pilgrims poured into Bodh Gaya this day. When the Dalai Lama and Panchen were chanting scriptures in the temple, the sound of trumpets and drums resounded through the sky.
