　　Recalling the First Flight to Beijing
　　Soviet Hero Mi·Gromov
　　In early 1925, I accepted the mission to participate in the Moscow-Beijing flight. Now, in 1956, to better understand what I experienced thirty-one years ago, my joy, my excitement, and all my feelings, I want to briefly recall the past. At that time, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet state had defeated the White bandit gangs and the armed interventionists who attacked from all sides during the civil war, and began to restore the national economy and eliminate the consequences of famine and destruction.
　　In a very short period, factories started operations, and railways were opened. Moreover, the Soviet Union, embarking on the path of industrialization, began massive construction work. Thanks to the efforts of the people and the Party, it opened up entirely new sectors in technology that were undreamed of in the old Tsarist Russia. For example, before the Great October Socialist Revolution, we had no aviation industry. Tsarist officials bought often outdated aircraft and engines from foreigners.
　　The Communist Party put forward a task: to get rid of dependence on foreign countries in aviation as well. By 1925, our industry, established through the heroic efforts of workers and engineers, began to produce aircraft and engines that were good by the standards of that time. To conduct the fullest possible testing of the new technology and for publicity purposes, it was decided to carry out a flight from Moscow to Beijing, which was unprecedented at the time.
　　In choosing the route, not only was the long distance appealing to the organizers of the flight, but also the long and deep friendship of the Russian people towards the Chinese people. When I learned that it was such an extraordinary flight, and that I was assigned to pilot the lead plane completely manufactured by Soviet factories, I felt great joy and pride. I understood the heavy responsibility on my shoulders and actively began the organizational work. I had to go to the engine manufacturing plant in Leningrad to observe the assembly of the aircraft, study maps, read many books, and listen to the conversations of people who had been to Mongolia and China. Finally, everything was ready. We tested the engine, the aircraft had a trial flight in the air, and then a group of aircraft flew out of Moscow.
　　Flying in the lead was the "P-2" Soviet aircraft with a 240-horsepower engine, behind it was the "AK-1" aircraft designed by Alexandrov and manufactured by the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute with a 160-horsepower engine, followed by two foreign aircraft for testing and comparison, each with a "BMB" engine of 185 horsepower. Behind this aerial formation were two "P-1" Soviet aircraft, each with an "M-5" engine of 400 horsepower. A total of six aircraft flew to Beijing.
　　If one recalls that no aircraft had instruments or radio, no one could guarantee to provide us with accurate weather data, and no country at that time knew about blind flying, then one can imagine the enormous risks taken by the aircraft and the pilots sitting in the flimsy open cockpits.
　　In order to land in some major cities for publicity and to demonstrate the growing aviation power of the Soviet state, we flew to the Urals, across Siberia, to the blue Lake Baikal. We encountered heavy rain and dense fog at Lake Baikal.
　　Gusts of wind blew over Lake Baikal, rainwater flowed into the cockpit, hitting faces and hands, and clothes were wet. Eyes could not be opened due to fatigue and lack of sleep. In order not to get lost in the mountains and the direction of the land along the coast, the aircraft had to fly at low altitude. In the mountains, I saw a dimly lit small river flowing into Lake Baikal, and I flew over the foaming rapids towards the source of the river. I knew that along this canyon, I could get out of the mountains and fly to Verkhneudinsk.
　　I constantly looked back to see if I could see Voykovoynov's plane. I had to wipe the glass of my glasses with leather gloves, watching the smoke that filled the mountains and the lake. Voykovoynov's plane appeared in the rain clouds for a while, and then suddenly disappeared. The flight was difficult, the mountains monitored us on the left and right, and a large number of rocks and cliffs appeared in front of the aircraft, so we had to pay special attention and carefully operate the aircraft.
　　The mechanic Rozhevich sitting behind me listened to the sound of the engine, and every time I turned around to look at him, he answered me with a pleasant smile.
　　In the silent, seemingly mysterious and crude Gobi Desert, there were severe tests waiting for us as on Lake Baikal: not only the dim desert below, but also violent storms struck the aircraft. The sky was torn apart by lightning, and thunder shook everything. The storm rushed towards the fuselage and wings, trying to destroy the tail and throw the aircraft to the ground. However, the Soviet pilots can be said to have fought heroically against the storm in this unknown remote place, in this uninhabited desert, and won the victory.
　　The Soviet aircraft flew well over the Gobi Desert, but one foreign-made aircraft had to make a forced landing.
　　I will never forget the excitement when the yellow, brown, and gray sands of the silent desert area ended, and the green mountains of China appeared in sight. We saw the famous Great Wall, meticulously cultivated fields, orchards, and plantations. Within a few minutes of being in China, we fully and clearly felt the strength and love of labor of the great people, and felt their strength and courage in the struggle against nature.
　　Ancient Beijing was in the light blue morning mist. Chinese aircraft welcoming us appeared against the background of white clouds. After circling Beijing a few times to salute, we landed our aircraft. I was glad that I was the first Soviet pilot to land on Chinese soil and the first to stand on this land.
　　Now, after many years, I ponder the results of the first flight to China, which lasted thirty-three days, and I come to the conclusion that under the scientific and technological level at the time, the flight was very interesting, and it made many contributions to the widespread popularization of aviation knowledge, especially to strengthening the friendly relations between the great Soviet and Chinese peoples and to the development of aviation technology.
　　Of course, it should be estimated that if it were not for the stops specifically for publicity in urban and rural areas, then the flight of this long and complex route would not have been thirty-three days, but about three days. By the way, it was exactly one year after the Moscow-Beijing flight that I accepted the mission to pilot the first all-metal Soviet "ANT-3" - "Proletarian" aircraft designed by the outstanding Soviet designer Tupolev to fly around Europe, in which flight I created a world record.
　　And now, the Soviet "Tu-104" jet airliner designed by Academician Tupolev completes the flight from Moscow to Beijing in just over eleven hours. The aircraft flies at high altitude regardless of weather conditions. The navigator's cockpit is equipped with the latest instruments. The pilot is not afraid of clouds or thunderstorms. He flies accurately according to the charts.
　　The achievements of Soviet science and technology and the great achievements of the national aviation industry are embodied in the "Tu-104" aircraft. Like the first Soviet-made aircraft that have long been placed in museums and served to bring the Soviet and Chinese peoples closer together, the "Tu-104" aircraft brought love and trust to the great free China on its wings, a country that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has followed the example of the Soviet Union and embarked on the socialist road, achieving outstanding achievements in industrialization and science and technology.
　　We look forward to seeing excellent Chinese aircraft coming to Moscow for a friendly visit. (Special contribution to this newspaper, translated by Zhang Ye)

### 回忆第一次飞往北京

　　回忆第一次飞往北京
　　苏联英雄　米·格罗莫夫
    1925年初，我接受了参加莫斯科—北京飞行的任务。现在，在1956年，为了更好地了解三十一年以前我所经历的情况、我的喜悦和激动以及我的一切感受，我想简单地回忆一下过去的情况。当时，苏维埃国家在共产党领导下在内战时期击溃了白卫匪帮和从四面八方来进攻的武装干涉者群寇，并且开始恢复国民经济和消灭饥荒和破坏的后果。
    在极短的时期内工厂开工了，铁路通车了。而且，走上工业化道路的苏联开始进行巨大的建设工作，由于人民和党的努力，在技术方面开辟了在旧的沙皇俄国所没有梦想过的完全新的部门。例如，在伟大十月社会主义革命以前，我们没有航空工业。沙皇官吏从外国人那里购买常常是旧式的飞机和引擎。
  共产党提出了一项任务：在航空方面也要摆脱对外国的依附状态。到1925年，由工人和工程师英勇努力所建立的我国工业开始生产在当时说来是很好的飞机和引擎。为了对新技术进行最充分的试验和为了宣传，决定进行在当时说来是从没有过的莫斯科到北京的飞行。
    在选择路线上，不仅是长的距离吸引着飞行的组织者，而且俄罗斯人民对中国人民所怀抱的悠久而深厚的友情也吸引着飞行的组织者。当我知道是这样一次不平凡的飞行，并且知道我被派驾驶完全由苏联工厂制造的领航机的时候，我感到极大的喜悦和骄傲。我明白了担在我肩上的重任，积极地做起组织工作来。必须到列宁格勒的制造引擎的工厂那里去观察一下飞机的装配，研究地图，读许多书，听一听到过蒙古和中国的人的谈话。最后，一切都准备好了，试一试引擎，飞机在空中试飞，于是一群飞机飞出莫斯科。
    在前面飞行的是二百四十马力的引擎的“P—2”式苏联飞机，在它后面的是由亚历山大罗夫设计、中央流体动力学研究所制造的一百六十马力的引擎的“AK—1”式飞机，后面跟着供试验和比较用的两架外国飞机，每架飞机的“BMB”式引擎都是一百八十五马力。在这个空中编队后面的是两架“P—1”式苏联飞机，每架飞机的“M—5”式引擎有四百马力。一共有六架飞机飞往北京。
    如果回想起没有一架飞机有仪器和无线电，没有谁能够保证供给我们准确的气象材料，在当时没有一个国家晓得盲目飞行，那末，可以想像到飞机和坐在不坚固的敞篷机舱里的驾驶员是冒着多么巨大的危险了。
    为了在一些大城市降落以进行宣传工作和展示苏维埃国家正在成长的航空威力，我们飞往乌拉尔，越过西伯利亚，飞到蓝色的贝加尔湖。我们在贝加尔湖遇到了大雨和浓雾。
    贝加尔湖上空刮着一阵一阵的风，雨水流进机舱，打到脸上和手上，衣服也湿了。由于疲劳和失眠，眼睛都睁不开了。为了不致迷失山中和沿岸地带的陆地方向，飞机不得不低空飞行。在山中，我看到一条流入贝加尔湖的发光暗淡的小河，我就在有泡沫的急流上空飞向小河的发源地。我知道，沿着这个峡谷就可以从山中出来飞向上乌金斯克。
    我时时地向后看，看看看到看不到沃伊科沃伊诺夫的飞机。必须用皮手套擦眼镜的玻璃，注视着迷漫在群山和湖上的烟雾。沃伊科沃伊诺夫的飞机一会儿出现在云雨中间，一会儿又突然消失了。飞行是困难的，群山在左右两面监视着我们，飞机前面出现了大量的岩石和峭壁，必须特别注意和用心地操纵飞机。
  坐在我身后的机械师罗杰维奇倾听着引擎的响声，每当我转过身来看他的时候，他都用愉快的微笑回答我。
    在沉寂的、似乎奥妙而粗野的戈壁沙漠上，也有像在贝加尔湖上那样严峻的考验等待着我们：不仅是下面的昏暗的沙漠，而且剧烈的暴风雨袭击了飞机。天空被闪电撕裂着，响雷震动着一切。暴风向机身和机翼冲来，竭力想破坏机尾并把飞机扔到地面上去。但是，苏联的飞行员可以说是在这谁也不知道的遥远的地方，在这荒无人烟的沙漠上空，英勇地同暴风雨进行了斗争，并且获得了胜利。
    苏联的飞机在戈壁沙漠上空飞行得很好，可是，有一架外国制造的飞机不得不被迫降落。
    我永远也忘不了当沉寂的沙漠地带的黄色、褐色和灰色沙子终了，视线里出现中国的葱绿山岭时的激动的情景。我们看到了著名的万里长城，精耕细作的田野、果园和种植场。在中国境内还没有几分钟，我们就已经充分和显明地感觉到伟大人民的力量和热爱劳动，感觉到他们在同自然斗争中的坚强和勇敢。
    古老的北京在淡青色的晨雾中。迎接我们的中国飞机出现在白云的背景上。在北京的上空盘旋了几圈致敬以后，我们使自己的飞机降落。我感到高兴的是，我是第一个在中国的土地上降落和第一个站在这块土地上的苏联飞行员。
    现在，过了许多年我思索着历时三十三天的第一次飞往中国的结果，我得出这样的结论：在当时的科学技术水平的条件下，飞行是非常有趣的，对于广泛普及航空知识，特别是对于加强伟大的苏中两国人民之间的友好联系和对于航空技术的发展有着许多贡献。
    当然应当估计到，如果不是专门为了在城乡进行宣传工作而停留，那末，这个长距离的复杂路线的飞行将不是三十三天，而大约是三天。顺便说说，恰恰是在莫斯科—北京飞行以后过了一年，我接受驾驶由卓越的苏联设计师图波列夫设计的第一架全部金属做的苏联“AHT—3”——“无产阶级”号飞机作环绕欧洲飞行的任务，在这次飞行中我创造了世界纪录。
    而现在，图波列夫院士设计的苏联“TY—104”喷气式客机用十一个多小时的时间就完成了从莫斯科到北京航线的飞行。飞机不顾气候条件在高空中飞行。领航员的机舱是用最新的仪器装备起来的。飞行员既不怕云雾，也不怕雷雨。他按照图表来准确地飞行。
    苏联科学和技术的成就以及本国航空工业的巨大成绩体现在“TY—104”飞机中。“TY—104”飞机像早已放在博物馆里的、曾为使苏中两国人民接近而服务的苏联最初制造的飞机一样，在它的机翼上带来了对伟大自由的中国的热爱和信任，这个国家在中国共产党的领导下，仿效苏联的范例，已走上社会主义的道路，在工业化和科学技术方面获得了卓越的成就。
    我们期待着在莫斯科看到飞到我们这里进行友好访问的中国的优秀飞机。　（本报特约稿　章叶译）
