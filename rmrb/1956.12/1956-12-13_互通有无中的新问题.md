    New Problems in Mutual Exchange of Goods
    By our reporter Jin Yukun
    Currently, the great production potential of many factories contrasts sharply with a serious shortage of raw materials. This has become one of the most prominent and acute contradictions among enterprises. Take Shenyang City as an example. Most factories have increased their plans for this year by more than 50% compared to last year, with some increasing by two to three times. However, the production departments that supply raw materials are unable to increase production at a corresponding rate. As a result, the raw materials allocated to factories by the state can only meet most or part of their needs. Fully utilizing the potential of existing materials in society and carrying out "mutual exchange of goods" between brother factories, although not fundamentally solving the problem of raw material shortages, can greatly help to resolve the complete supply of materials and the supply of urgent materials, thus ensuring the smooth completion of production plans by some enterprises. Since Shenyang City's factories began "mutual exchange of goods," they have helped many factories solve the problem of shortages of key materials. As a result, reductions in production that were originally needed have been avoided or reduced, and some factories have even increased production. At the same time, many unreasonable phenomena of using large materials for small purposes and using superior materials for inferior purposes have also been avoided. Currently, it seems that the materials needed for state-owned and local state-owned factories to complete this year's production plans have been basically resolved. No production interruptions due to material shortages have occurred so far.

    Mutual assistance, using surpluses to make up for shortages, and striving to jointly complete the state plan is undoubtedly a good thing. Moreover, in the future, due to possible inappropriate planning arrangements and unfixed production tasks, there will still be cases where materials are stockpiled in one place but insufficient or incomplete in another. Therefore, the method of "mutual exchange of goods" is still needed.

    The problem is that "mutual exchange of goods" must be carried out with leadership and organization, and not be placed in a chaotic "free market." Currently, many factories in Shenyang City have generated some chaotic and abnormal phenomena in "mutual exchange of goods," and the main problem lies here. Since Shenyang City proposed "mutual exchange of goods" in the second quarter of this year, factories were initially able to adhere to the spirit of mutual support and mutual adjustment, and were able to take out anything they did not need to help others, thus playing a positive role. Later, the phenomenon of barter appeared, coupled with insufficient organizational leadership, and the situation began to become increasingly abnormal. Currency has slowly lost its due role here. For example, a certain electrical equipment manufacturing factory lacked a certain type of copper wire, but the unit that had this copper wire was unwilling to accept money, and demanded to exchange it for welding rods. The electrical appliance factory did not have welding rods, so it went around looking for them. But the unit with welding rods then proposed to exchange them for round steel. The unit with round steel then wanted to exchange it for iron wire… As a result, it took six or seven units to exchange for what was needed. Similar exchanges have become a common formula. The impact even extended to buying things in stores, which also required exchanging equivalent materials, otherwise one could only sigh at the goods even with money. When Shenyang Rolling Steel Mill bought a car from the Transportation Electrical Appliance Company, the condition put forward by the other party was fourteen tons of wire. When Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant bought fifty sets of cotton clothes from Shenyang United Company (department store), it also needed to send ten tons of pig iron in exchange.

    "Barter," in the current situation of widespread material shortages, is not unacceptable in order to encourage the enthusiasm of enterprises to exchange materials, eliminate everyone's ideological concerns, and expand the scope of material adjustment. However, some factories, due to the machinations of departmentalism, completely abandoned the original purpose of mutual assistance and using surpluses to make up for shortages when conducting barter. If you have nothing to exchange, they will not help you even if you are in dire need. Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory was in danger of shutting down its furnace due to a shortage of scrap steel. The supply department wanted Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Factory to support 500 tons of scrap steel; although this factory had a large inventory, it refused to help. Some even took advantage of others' urgent needs to demand exchanging less for more, or exchanged for other people's things, but did not give others what they should have exchanged, trying to get away with it. In short, they would not do anything that was not beneficial to themselves.

    With the prevalence of barter, everyone wanted to grab a handful as soon as possible so that they would have "things" to exchange, otherwise they would not have enough "capital" on hand to be confident, and even the qualification to participate in material adjustment meetings would be cancelled (there was a notice saying that those who had nothing to exchange did not need to participate). As a result, all kinds of phenomena appeared in the market. There were phenomena of scrambling for materials, and there were also phenomena similar to hoarding and speculation. As long as the market lacked something, everyone grabbed it. With these "rare goods" in hand, there was no need to worry about what to exchange for. When a certain unit announced that as long as there were heating radiators, anything could be exchanged for them, heating radiators became the object of competition in the market, and even those who did not need heating radiators at all were grabbing them everywhere. A certain machine tool factory in Shenyang blindly increased its supply plan and grabbed materials everywhere. They wanted any kind of carbon steel, and as a result, by the end of the third quarter, the main raw materials exceeded the quota by 1.4 million yuan. Of the 200 tons of round steel purchased by a certain machinery factory in Shenyang in the third quarter, only a small amount could be used for the factory's own processing and substitution, and most of it was purchased for "exchange." In the past two months, 89% of the large amount of materials exchanged by a certain local state-owned machinery factory in Shenyang were newly purchased, not needed by the factory itself, and in great demand in the market.

    The material supply situation was already relatively tight, and the grabbing everywhere artificially increased the degree of tension. Such a vicious cycle is terrible.

    Judging from the current situation of factory inventory materials, the degree of material supply tension should be eased. The inventory of state-owned and local state-owned factories is increasing month by month. According to a bank survey, the total material reserves of state-owned and local state-owned factories in the city have now exceeded the quota by an average of 20%, of which local state-owned factories exceeded the quota by 47%. The value of materials stockpiled by factories throughout the city is about 40 million yuan, of which about 30 million yuan are long-term stockpiled materials. The potential of materials is still very large. However, the current situation seems not to be easing but becoming more tense. This is caused by the above-mentioned artificial factors. In particular, some factories see that the material supply situation may still be tight next year, so they are still desperately grabbing materials everywhere. Some are grabbing even more fiercely, and some long-term stockpiled materials are now even more unwilling to be transferred out, and they all plan to keep them there for future "contingencies." The situation of only wanting to transfer in but not wanting to transfer out is even more common. In this way, the current tight material supply situation has become even more complicated.

    The tight material supply situation cannot be resolved in a short time, but the current artificial tension must be stopped quickly. Comrades from the supply organs told me that many factories have now formed a chaotic state of "not recognizing relatives." The material allocation orders of the superior organs can be rejected, the letters of introduction from the provincial and municipal committees can also be ignored, and the true situation of material reserves cannot be ascertained. Due to various reasons, the local authorities are powerless to do anything about this, and the ministries and bureaus are even more beyond reach. The factories say, I know that doing this is wrong, but what else can I do if I don't do this? If I don't grab this bowl of rice, I won't have any rice to eat, who cares? …. However, no matter what these people say, we cannot allow this chaotic "black market" to continue to develop. Otherwise, it will bring unimaginable chaos to next year's material supply work. The relevant leading organs of the central government should quickly take countermeasures, strengthen the organization and leadership of material adjustment work, and gradually stabilize the artificially tense situation.

    互通有无中的新问题
    本报记者　金雨困
    目前，许多工厂生产的潜力很大而原材料的供应十分不足，这已成为当前企业最主要和最尖锐的矛盾之一。以沈阳市为例，大部分工厂今年的计划比去年提高了50％以上，个别的提高到二至三倍。而供应原材料的生产部门却并不能以相应的速度增加生产，因此国家给工厂调拨的原材料只能满足工厂所需的大部或一部。充分发挥社会上现有材料的潜力，开展兄弟厂之间的“互通有无”，虽不能根本解决原材料供应不足的问题，但对解决材料的成套供应和紧急用料的供应，以保证部分企业顺利地完成生产计划，却有很大作用。沈阳市各工厂开展“互通有无”以来，帮助许多工厂解决了关键材料不足的问题，因而本来需要减产的可不减或少减了，有的厂还增加了生产。同时也避免了不少大材小用、优材劣用的不合理现象。目前看来，无论国营和地方国营工厂完成今年度生产计划所需材料，基本上已获解决，因材料供应不足而影响生产中断的现象，至今还未发生过。
    互相帮助，以有济无，争取共同完成国家计划，这无疑是一件很好的事情。而且在今后，由于计划安排可能不当，生产任务也可能不固定，材料此处积压在彼处不足或不成套的现象还会有，因此“互通有无”的办法仍然是需要的。
    问题是“互通有无”必须有领导有组织地进行，不能置之于混乱的“自由市场”上。目前，沈阳市许多工厂“互通有无”中产生了一些混乱和不正常的现象，主要的问题也就在这里。沈阳市从今年第二季度提出“互通有无”以来，开始时各工厂还能本着互相支援、互相调剂的精神，凡己所不需，都能拿出来帮助别人，因此起了积极的作用。其后，就出现了物物交换的现象，加上组织领导的不足，情况就开始越来越不正常。货币，在这里已慢慢丧失了它应有的作用。例如某电工器材制造厂缺某种铜线，而有这种铜线的单位却不肯要钱，要求以电焊条交换。电器制造厂没有电焊条，就去四处寻找。而有电焊条的单位又提出以元钢换。有元钢的又要以铁线换……结果换了六、七个单位才换到所需的东西。类似这样的交换已成普遍的公式。影响所及，甚至到商店买东西，也要以等价材料交换，否则有钱也只能望物兴叹。沈阳轧钢厂在交通电器公司买一辆汽车，对方提的条件是十四吨线材。沈阳重型机器厂到沈阳联营公司（百货商店）买五十套棉衣，也需送上十吨生铁交换。
    “物物交换”，这在目前普遍缺料的情况下，为了鼓励各企业交换材料的积极性，消除大家的思想顾虑，扩大调剂材料的范围，并不是不可采用的。但是有些工厂由于本位主义思想作怪，在进行物物交换时，完全背弃了相互帮助、以有济无的原旨。你如无物可换出，即使处在燃眉之急，也不给你通有无。大连工矿车辆厂因缺废钢有停炉危险，供应部门要大连机车车辆制造工厂支援五百吨废钢；这个厂库存量虽不少，却拒不帮助。有的甚至乘人之急要求以少换多，或者是把人家的东西换进了，却不把自己应该换出的东西给人，企图一赖了之。总之不利己的事情他就不干。
    随着物物交换的盛行，大家都想趁早抓一把，以便有“物”可换，否则手头没有点“资本”，腰板也硬不起来，甚至连参加物资调剂会议的资格都被取消（曾有通知，无物可换出者可不必参加）。于是，市场上形形色色的现象都随之出现。争夺物资的现象有，类似囤积居奇的现象也有。只要市场缺什么东西，大家就抓什么东西。有了这些“奇货”在手，那么要换什么东西都不用愁。某单位一宣布只要有暖汽片，要换什么东西都可以；于是暖汽片就成为市场上的争夺对象，即使根本不需要暖汽片的也到处抓起暖汽片来。沈阳某机床厂盲目加大了供应计划，到处抓料，有什么炭素钢，他们就要什么，结果到第三季度末主要原材料超过定额一百四十万元。沈阳某机械厂第三季度购进的二百吨元钢，仅少量可作本厂加工代用，大部分是为了“换货”而购进的。沈阳某地方国营机械厂，近两个月换出的大量材料中，有89％是新购进的、本厂并不需要而市场上十分缺乏的物资。
    本来材料供应情况比较紧张，加上大家到处乱抓，就人为地增加了紧张程度。如此恶性循环下去是不得了的事情。
    从目前工厂库存材料情况来看，材料供应紧张程度应该有所缓和。无论国营或地方国营工厂库存量都是月月增加。据银行调查，目前全市国营和地方国营工厂的整个材料储备已平均超额20％，其中地方国营工厂超额47％。全市工厂积压的材料价值约达四千余万元，其中长期积压的材料约有三千多万元。材料的潜力仍然是很大的。但是目前的情况，看来却不是缓和而是更加紧张了。这就是上述的人为因素所促成的。特别是由于有些工厂看到明年度材料供应仍然可能紧张，因此还在继续到处拼命抓材料。有的抓得更凶了，有些长期积压的材料，现在是更不愿意调出了，都打算放在那里备日后“不时之需”。只愿调进不愿调出的情况更为普遍。这样，就把目前材料供应紧张的情况弄得更加复杂化了。
    材料供应的紧张情况虽不是一时所能解决的，但是目前某些人为的紧张现象必须迅速制止。供应机关的同志告诉我，目前许多工厂实际上已形成“六亲不认”的混乱状态。上级机关的材料调拨命令可以拒不执行，省市委的介绍信也可以置之不理，材料储备的真实情况，也摸不清楚。地方由于种种原因，谁对此都无能为力，而部局更是鞭长莫及。工厂说，我虽明知这样干不对，但是不这样干又怎么办？我不抢这碗饭吃，我就没有饭吃，谁管？……。但是，不管这些人怎样说，总不能听任这种混乱的“黑市”继续发展下去。否则将给明年的材料供应工作带来不堪设想的混乱。关于这个问题，中央有关的领导机关应该迅速采取对策，加强对材料调剂工作的组织领导，把人为的紧张局面逐步稳定下来。
