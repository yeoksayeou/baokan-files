    Improving Design Based on User Feedback
    Product Quality Improved at Shanghai Boiler Factory
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the medium and low-pressure boilers manufactured by the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory have been continuously improved year after year in terms of product quality through constant solicitation of user feedback and modification of product designs.
    Not long ago, designers and technicians from the Shanghai Boiler Factory who had returned from Huainan were using the trial operation of the forty-ton medium-pressure boiler produced by the factory, in conjunction with the 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in Huainan, and the user's feedback as a basis for improving the design of this type of boiler.
    The five types of low-pressure boilers produced by the Shanghai Boiler Factory are sold throughout the country. Since 1953, the factory has sent engineers, technicians, and skilled workers three times to Northeast China, North China, and Northwest China to understand the use of boilers in various regions and solicit user feedback. Up to now, the factory has successively received more than one hundred pieces of user feedback, which have been summarized into forty-four items and improved in design and manufacture. For example, users pointed out that the T-type boiler grate often experiences coal bridging and broken grate bars during operation, and that the safety valve spring is prone to breakage and is unsafe. The factory's design department and inspection department, based on user feedback, re-examined and modified the structure of the grate.
    Now, the factory is preparing to make user visits a regular task in order to solicit more user feedback and continuously improve product quality.

    根据用户意见改进设计
    上海锅炉厂产品质量提高
    据新华社讯　国营上海锅炉厂制造的中压、低压锅炉，经过不断征求用户意见、修改产品设计，使产品的质量一年比一年进步。
    不久以前从淮南回来的上海锅炉厂的设计师和技术员，正在根据这个厂生产的四十吨中压锅炉在淮南配合六千瓩汽轮发电机试运转情况和用户的意见，着手改进这种锅炉的设计。
    上海锅炉厂出产的五种低压锅炉远销全国各地。从1953年开始，这个厂三次派出工程师、技术员和技术工人，到东北、华北、西北等地了解锅炉在各地使用的情况和征求用户意见。到目前止，这个厂陆续收到用户意见一百多条，这些意见被归纳为四十四条，在设计制造中作了改进。例如用户提出Ｔ型锅炉炉排运转的时候往往发生隔煤、折断炉条和安全阀门弹簧容易断、不安全等毛病，这个厂的设计科和检验科就根据用户意见，重新检查和修改了炉排的结构。
    现在，这个厂准备把访问用户作为一项经常性的工作，以便更多地征求用户意见，不断提高产品质量。
