　　Do a Better Job in Commercial Work
　　Zhuo Baozi
Since October, the Shandong market has entered its peak season after autumn. With the arrival of the peak season and the increase in people's purchasing power, the shortage of supply of certain commodities has become increasingly obvious. If commercial departments do not arrange commodities reasonably enough, do not transfer them in time, and if the state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives in some places do not maintain close enough contact, the shortage or even out-of-stock situation of commodity supply will become even more tense.

The fundamental reason for the current shortage of commodity supply lies in the fact that the growth rate of commodities cannot keep up with the growth rate of people's needs; however, if commercial departments do a better job, they can appropriately solve some of the difficulties of insufficient supply; it can also reduce some of the supply tension caused by improper work. According to the situation in some parts of Shandong Province, I believe that commercial departments can do more work in the following aspects.

　　Regulate inventory commodities under leadership

First of all, the role of existing inventory materials should be fully utilized. Some units do not carefully check warehouse inventory, rationally arrange commodities, and vigorously organize transfer and regulation, and blindly call for insufficient supply. This is a harmful phenomenon. At present, the shortage or tight supply of some commodities is not entirely due to insufficient supply, but due to human causes. For example, bicycles are currently out of stock in many places, but Qingdao Electrical Appliances Company has inventory. Because the department store company failed to arrange a regional supply plan in time, the supply of goods could not be organized for a long time; the grassroots cooperatives in Guangrao County were out of stock of 440 kinds of commodities, while the local state-owned companies and county supply and marketing cooperatives had more than 250 kinds of goods, accounting for more than 50% of the out-of-stock commodities; the wholesale unit of Laiyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative had more than 200 kinds of porcelain in stock, while during the previous period, the store of the Chishan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the county only had one teapot and two teacups on its shelves. In order to solve this man-made supply tension, department stores in Qingdao, Jinan and other nine cities and counties in Shandong Province have held internal material exchange meetings to mutually regulate 180,000 yuan of goods. At the internal material exchange meeting held by the Changwei Prefectural Department Store Branch on November 5, by calculating the accounts of purchase, sales and inventory, nine tons of white sugar were regulated between counties. The Huimin Prefectural Branch transferred 665 dozens of health shirts and trousers from Weixian and Lijin to support the urgent needs of Guangrao, Qidong, Zouping and other places.

Another important link in giving full play to the strength of existing inventory materials is to connect the state and cooperative plans and organize internal material exchanges between the state and cooperative. In order to do a good job in supplying the peak season market, the Tai'an Prefectural Committee, under the unified leadership of the Party and government, held an internal material exchange meeting attended by more than 400 cadres from state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives. On the basis of unifying thinking and improving understanding, internal material exchanges were organized. A total of 577 contracts and agreements were signed, and the total transaction value between the state and cooperative accounted for 102.47% of the total value of the state-owned company's supply plan to the supply and marketing cooperative in the fourth quarter; cooperatives and cooperatives, and companies and companies also conducted trade to supply what the others lack, which played a great role in solving the source of goods for the peak season market.

While organizing material regulation, we must also educate employees to overcome departmentalism and reluctance to sell. At present, due to the insufficient supply of certain materials, some units and operators have developed a harmful departmentalism. Some units clearly have a large inventory, but when they are asked to regulate some materials to support other regions or other units, they are unwilling to transfer them; some units and personnel, when certain commodities are in short supply, clearly have goods in stock, but they are unwilling to sell them. This kind of departmentalism and blind reluctance to sell is not only not conducive to meeting the needs of the people, but also may lead to the phenomenon of accumulation in one place, out-of-stock in another, and tension now and accumulation in the future, which is very detrimental to the operation of the commercial sector itself.

　　Fully tap local potential

At present, some commercial cadres do not pay enough attention to the production potential of the local area. However, facts have proved that the potential in this area is still considerable. For example, since October, Jiaoxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative has signed 84 production and sales contracts with 12 handicraft cooperatives, worth 65,000 yuan, with 75 kinds of commodities, including: hemp rope, furnace bottom, pot mouth, iron shovel, hoe, etc. Huangxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative, according to the characteristics of handicraft products that "one region has one specification," each district's grassroots cooperative organizes sources of goods separately. According to the understanding in October, the grassroots cooperatives in the county have signed contracts with handicraft cooperatives worth more than 220,000 yuan. The advantages of this approach are: the goods are right, the price is cheap, the supply is timely, and it also supports handicrafts and sideline production of agricultural cooperatives.

As for some commodities that are indeed in short supply, commercial departments can obtain the cooperation and support of relevant departments and advocate reasonable conservation. For example, the supply of paper is relatively tight now, but the phenomenon of waste of paper is still quite serious. At present, many departments have internal publications, many departments issue too many copies of documents that do not need to be copied, and some reports and documents that can be omitted or reduced are issued in large numbers. Therefore, there is great potential for reasonable conservation of paper.

　　把商业工作做得更好一些
　　禚宝梓
    山东市场自10月份已开始进入秋后旺季。随着旺季的到来和人民购买力的提高，某些商品供应不足的情况，愈益明显。如果商业部门对商品摆布不够合理，调运不够及时，以及某些地方国营商业、供销社联系不够密切，商品供应不足甚至脱销的情况就愈加紧张。
    目前商品供应不足的根本原因，虽然在于商品的增长速度赶不上人民需要的增长速度；但是，商业部门如果把工作做的更好一些，是可以适当解决一部分货源不足的困难的；也可以减少一部分由于工作不当而造成的供应紧张现象。根据山东省有些地方的情况来看，我认为商业部门可以从以下几个方面多做一些工作。有领导地调剂库存商品
    首先应当充分发挥现有库存物资的作用。有些单位不认真检查仓库存货，合理摆布商品和大力组织调运、调剂，一味叫喊货源不足，这是一种有害的现象。现在有些商品脱销或供应紧张，并非完全因为货源不足，而是由于人为的原因造成的。例如目前许多地方自行车脱销，但青岛交电公司却有存货，由于百货公司未能及早安排好地区供应计划，以致商品迟迟不能组织供应；广饶全县基层社脱销商品共达四百四十种，而当地国营公司及县供销社有货的即达二百五十多种，占脱销商品的50％以上；莱阳县供销社的批发单位库存二百多种瓷器，而前一时期该县赤山区供销社门市部货架上仅有一把茶壶，两个茶碗。为了解决这种人为的供应紧张现象，山东省青岛、济南等九个市、县的百货公司都分别召开了内部物资交流会议，相互调剂了十八万元的货物。昌潍专区百货公司分公司在11月5日召开的内部物资交流会议上，通过计算进货、销售和库存的账，在县与县之间调剂了白糖九吨。惠民专区分公司由潍县，利津调出卫生衫、裤六百六十五打，支援了广饶、齐东、邹平等地的急需。
    充分发挥现有库存物资力量作用的又一个重要环节，是把国、合计划衔接起来，组织国、合内部的物资交流。泰安专区为了做好旺季市场的供应工作，在党、政统一领导下，召开了有国营商业、供销合作社干部参加的四百多人的内部物资交流会议，在统一思想、提高认识的基础上，组织了内部物资交流，共签订合同、协议五百七十七份，国、合之间成交总值占国营公司第四季度供应供销社计划总值的102.47％；合作社与合作社之间、公司与公司之间并进行了有无调剂，因而对解决旺季市场的货源问题，起了很大作用。
    在组织物资调剂的同时，还要教育职工克服本位主义与惜售思想。目前，由于某些物资供应不足，部分单位和经营人员，已经发生了一种有害的本位主义思想。有的单位明明库存力量不小，当要从他们那里调剂一部分物资支援其他地区或其他单位时，他们却不愿调给；也有的单位和人员，当着某些商品供应紧张的时候，明明库存有货，他们也不愿出售。这种本位主义和盲目的惜售思想，不仅不利于供应人民的需要，而且很可能发生此地积压、彼地脱销和现在紧张、将来积压的现象，这对商业部门本身的经营也是非常不利的。
    充分发掘地方潜力
    现在有些商业干部对于地方上的生产潜力注意不足。而事实证明这方面的潜力还是不小的。例如胶县供销社自10月份以来，已经和十二个手工业社签订了产销合同八十四份，价值六万五千元，商品七十五种，其中主要的商品有：麻绳、炉底、锅口、铁锹、镢头等。黄县供销合作社，根据手工业产品“一个地区一种规格”的特点，由各区基层社分别组织货源，据10月份了解，全县基层社已与手工业社签订了价值二十二万余元的合同。这种做法的好处是：商品对路，价格便宜，供应及时，同时也扶持了手工业和农业社的副业生产。
    至于某些货源确实不足的商品，商业部门可以取得有关部门的配合与支持，提倡合理的节约。例如现在纸张的供应是比较紧张的，但是浪费纸张的现象也还比较严重。目前不少部门都出有内部刊物，很多部门不须抄致的文件副本发的很滥，有些报表、文件可以不发或者少发的却发的很多。因此，可以合理节约纸张的潜力是很大的。
