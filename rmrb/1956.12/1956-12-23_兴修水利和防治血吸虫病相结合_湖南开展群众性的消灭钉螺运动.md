    Combining Water Conservancy Construction and Schistosomiasis Prevention:
    Hunan Launches Mass Snail Eradication Campaign
    (Our report) On the construction sites for repairing dikes and embankments around Dongting Lake, a mass snail eradication campaign has been launched.
    According to incomplete statistics, in eighteen counties and cities along Dongting Lake, including Changde, Huarong, Yiyang, Yueyang, Hanshou, Yuanjiang, Lixian, Xiangyin, Wangcheng, Cili, and Shimen, snails have been eradicated from approximately 100,000 mu of land. Among them, Guangxingzhou Township in Yueyang County even adopted the method of land reclamation by tractors, eradicating snails from more than 6,000 mu.
    This snail eradication campaign was carried out based on the principle of "both building water conservancy and eliminating diseases," determined at the Third Hunan Provincial Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Work Conference in mid-August. In general dike and embankment construction sites, prevention and control cadres and agricultural cooperative health workers, while laborers and engineering technicians were clearing obstacles, removing hidden dangers, and reinforcing the dike body, swept away the snails and soil debris attached to the dike body together for composting or burial. For larger water conservancy construction projects, measures were taken to change the snails' living environment by opening new ditches, filling old ditches, or building sluice gates. In lake swamps, ditches, and field dams, methods combining grass removal for composting and winter planting were adopted. In addition, some areas also carried out burning and dike construction on large barren islands outside the embankments to eradicate snails.

    兴修水利和防治血吸虫病相结合
    湖南开展群众性的消灭钉螺运动
    本报讯　在洞庭湖畔整修堤垸的工地上，开展了群众性的消灭钉螺运动。
    据不完全统计，常德、华容、益阳、岳阳、汉寿、沅江、澧县、湘阴、望城、慈利和石门等十八个沿洞庭湖滨的县、市，已经在十万亩左右的面积上消灭了钉螺。其中，岳阳县广兴洲乡还曾采用拖拉机垦荒的办法，灭螺达六千多亩。
    这一次开展的灭螺运动，是根据8月中旬湖南省第三次血吸虫病防治工作会议所确定的“既能兴水利，又能除病害”这一原则进行的。在一般堤垸工地，各地的防治干部和农业社保健员等，当民工和工程技术人员在堤身扫除障碍、清除隐患、加以培修的时候，便把附在堤身的钉螺和土屑一同扫除运走，作堆肥或进行土埋；对较大的水利兴修工程，即采取改变钉螺生存环境的办法，开新沟、填旧沟或兴建水闸；在湖?、沟港和田堰上，则采取了结合铲草堆肥和冬季种植的方法进行。此外有些地区还在垸外大块荒洲上进行火烧、围堤消灭钉螺。
