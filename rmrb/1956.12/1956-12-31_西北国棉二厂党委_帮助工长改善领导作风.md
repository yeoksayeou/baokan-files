    Northwest State-Owned Cotton Mill No. 2 Party Committee
    Helps Foremen Improve Leadership Style
    (Our Dispatch) In implementing the system of division of responsibilities under the leadership of the Party Committee, the Party Committee of the Northwest Second State-Owned Cotton Mill has paid attention to leveraging the enthusiasm of the deputy foremen in each work area, teaching them the working methods of the mass line.
    The work area in the textile mill is the basic production organization, and the deputy foremen are the administrative leaders of the work area, directly participating in production. Due to the lack of specific assistance from leadership in the past, especially in implementing the "one-chief system," emphasizing the deputy foremen's complete leadership over the work area, this promoted the deputy foremen's commandism and subjectivism in their work style. They didn't consult with the masses on issues and didn't use persuasion and education regarding workers' shortcomings, instead resorting to criticism. As a result, their relationship with the workers gradually became strained. When the factory began to change the leadership system, many deputy foremen and workers didn't understand the new spirit. Some workers reflected: "In the past, whatever the deputy foreman said was the law. Now we have freedom, and we don't have to be managed by him anymore." Some individual workers even wanted to "get back at" the deputy foremen. Some deputy foremen were also afraid of "struggle" and felt uneasy. In the pre-spinning workshop, nine out of twenty-one deputy foremen were unwilling to continue in the position.
    In response to this ideological situation, the Party and Communist Youth League branches, along with the workshop administration, mobilized Party members, League members, and all workers, educating them to obey leadership and observe discipline. The Party Committee Secretary specifically reported to the deputy foremen on how to promote democracy, rely on the masses, and work boldly. The pre-spinning and fine spinning branches convened forums for the deputy foremen to study how to be good deputy foremen. The grassroots trade unions also convened meetings of trade union group leaders to discuss how to cooperate with and support the deputy foremen in achieving successful production. The branches conducted a factual analysis of the deputy foremen's shortcomings in their past work, changing the previous method of indiscriminate labeling.
    Through the above work, the deputy foremen felt that they had the support of the masses and the backing of the Party, greatly increasing their enthusiasm for work. In the pre-spinning workshop, twenty deputy foremen proactively sought out the trade union group leaders and Party and League members to suggest restoring and establishing twenty core groups. Many workers reflected: "Our deputy foremen have changed; they are no longer so subjective and rigid." The Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League group leaders also felt that their work had become easier, and the enthusiasm of the masses had also increased.

### 西北国棉二厂党委  帮助工长改善领导作风

    西北国棉二厂党委
    帮助工长改善领导作风
    本报讯　国营西北第二棉纺织厂党委在贯彻党委领导下的分工负责制中，注意发挥各工区副工长的积极性，教给他们群众路线的工作方法。
    纺织厂的工区是生产基层组织，副工长是工区的行政领导，他们都直接参加生产。由于领导上以往对他们缺乏具体帮助，尤其在实行“一长制”中强调副工长对工区实行全权领导，促成了副工长的强迫命令和主观主义的工作作风，遇事不和群众商量，对工人的缺点不是说服教育，而是采取指责的方式，因此和工人的关系逐步疏远，这次开始改变领导制度的时候，不少副工长和职工没有领会新的精神。有的工人反映：过去副工长说啥就是啥，现在可自由了，再不由他管了。个别工人甚至还想整一整副工长。一些副工长也害怕“斗争”，心情不安。前纺车间二十一个副工长就有九个不愿当副工长。
    针对这种思想情况，党团支部和车间行政方面分别向党员、团员和全体工人进行动员，教育他们要服从领导，遵守纪律。党委书记专门向副工长报告了如何发扬民主、依靠群众，大胆工作。前纺和细纱支部都召集副工长座谈研究怎样当好副工长。各基层工会又召集工会小组长会议，研究如何配合、支持副工长搞好生产。支部对副工长以往工作中的缺点，进行实事求是的分析，改变了过去扣大帽子的方法。
    通过以上工作，副工长感到有群众支持，有党撑腰，工作积极性大大提高。前纺车间有二十个副工长主动的找工会组长和党、团员建议恢复和成立了二十个核心小组。许多工人反映说：我们的副工长变了，再不那么主观生硬了。党、工会和青年团小组长也感到工作好做了，群众的积极性也提高了。
