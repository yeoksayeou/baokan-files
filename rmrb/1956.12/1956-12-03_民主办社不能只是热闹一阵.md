Democratic Cooperative Management Cannot Be Just a Passing Fad
Xiao Qian

The Longhua Agricultural Production Cooperative is a key cooperative under the control of the Jiangpu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province. The cooperative's production is relatively good, but the cooperative's leading cadres have a very poor democratic work style. Among the cooperative cadres, there is a prevailing argument: "The cooperative is run by the cadres. If the cooperative is run well, it is to the credit of the cadres; if it is run poorly, the cadres are responsible." "Now that we've achieved advanced collectivization, the members' pigtails are in our hands. We can do whatever we want with the members. They can't withdraw from the cooperative anyway." In their daily work, the cooperative cadres are unwilling to patiently persuade and educate the members. Some cadres say, "There are as many things to do as there are hairs on an ox; where do we have the time to waste our breath arguing with the members?" They often use phrases such as "capitalist thinking," "sabotaging the cooperative," "you'll be responsible if you don't complete the plan," and "withdraw from the cooperative if you don't want to do it" to scare the members. They also impose various economic restrictions, with as many as eight different ways to "deduct work points." As a result, the enthusiasm of the masses is dampened. Some members say, "After joining the advanced cooperative, we handed over our land, livestock, and even ourselves to the cooperative. Our lives are in your (referring to the cadres) hands. You can do whatever you want with us." For a long time, there has been a phenomenon in the cooperative where the attendance rate is very high, but the labor efficiency is very low.

After the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the CPC issued a circular on improving the work style of cadres and launching discussions on democratic cooperative management, relevant departments of the Provincial Party Committee sent people to the cooperative to understand the situation of democratic cooperative management. On July 5, the cooperative's Party branch organized cadres to study the Provincial Party Committee's circular. However, the purpose and requirements of the study, as well as how to study, were not well researched. They only read the documents and everyone superficially chatted and made some self-criticisms, and then it was over.

On July 25, the County Party Secretary came to the cooperative twice in a row to check on the study of democratic cooperative management. Thus, the study began again. However, the County Party Committee had not made any specific arrangements for the discussion of democratic cooperative management, nor had it put forward any specific requirements. When the County Party Secretary came to the cooperative, he only listened to reports and did not give any specific instructions. Therefore, this study was no better than the previous one. They didn't even read the documents, and instead immediately asked everyone to make self-criticisms. The purpose of the study was still unclear, causing some confused thinking. Some cooperative cadres said, "This is the leadership undermining us," mistakenly believing that implementing democratic cooperative management was to rectify the cadres. Some cadres believed that the study of democratic cooperative management was a task assigned by the higher authorities, and they regarded it as an extra burden. When the cooperative members heard that they were going to implement democratic cooperative management, they were very excited and had a strong desire for democracy. The leadership had not yet understood the purpose and significance of democratic cooperative management, so naturally they could not correctly meet the demands of the masses for democratic cooperative management. Therefore, during the study period, some abnormal phenomena occurred in individual production teams. For example, the members of the eighth team had a lot of opinions about the team leader and demanded that a meeting of members be held to discuss the production plan, open the accounts, and ask the team leader to provide necessary explanations for certain issues, but they did not receive a reply for a long time, so the members did not go to the fields to work for half a day.

When the Party branch of the cooperative saw these situations, they became suspicious of democratic cooperative management, fearing that it would cause chaos, so they hastily ended it. Under the pretext of arranging autumn harvesting and planting work, each team held a meeting of members, made some explanations, and that was it. Only the teams with particularly serious problems (such as the eighth team) held special meetings to allow the cadres to make self-criticisms. In this way, democratic cooperative management blew through the cooperative like a gust of wind.

This study did play a role in improving the work style of the leadership to some extent. For example, some cadres who never consulted with the masses when making decisions have now begun to listen to the opinions of the masses; the cooperative has also held a symposium of old farmers to discuss production reform issues; and some cadres have also conducted individual visits to understand the needs of the masses. However, because the cooperative cadres did not truly solve the problem in terms of understanding, and the necessary democratic system was not established, not long after the study, the old problems reappeared, and the cadres also became smarter. For example, Vice-Director Shang Zilong said that deducting work points is coercive and does not sound good, so in the future, it should be called "compensating" work points. The fourth team contracted the output of the fields on the edge of the village to the members, stipulating that if they harvested less, each household would be required to compensate proportionally to the number of chickens they raised, otherwise they would not be allowed to raise chickens. The cadres of the first and ninth teams all believed that it was impossible not to deduct work points. They said: "If the members want to go to heaven, you will fly to heaven with them. If you don't deduct work points, what can you do with these naughty households?" These teams have returned to the situation before the discussion on democratic cooperative management.

These situations in the Longhua Cooperative raise a noteworthy issue: democratic cooperative management and the education of cadres in the mass line is a long-term task. If the County Party Committee does not go deep into reality and does not provide specific assistance to the grassroots cadres, it may cause democratic cooperative management to be just a passing fad and will not solve the actual problems in the work.

　　民主办社不能只是热闹一阵
　　小千
    龙华农业生产合作社是江苏省中共江浦县委所掌握的重点社。这个社生产搞得较好，但是社的领导干部民主作风很差。在社干部中流传着这样的论调：“合作社是干部办的，合作社办好了是干部的功劳，办坏了要干部负责。”“实现了高级化，社员小辫子掌握在我们手里，要社员怎么就怎么，反正退不了社。”在日常工作中，社干部对社员不愿进行耐心的说服教育。有些干部说：“事情多如牛毛，那有时间去和社员们磨嘴。”他们常用“资本主义思想”、“破坏合作社”、“完不成计划要你负责”、“不干就退社”等话来吓唬社员；而且还从经济上进行各种限制，仅“扣工分”的名目就有八种之多。这样做的结果，挫伤了群众的积极性。有的社员说：“入了高级社，田地、耕畜连人都交给了社，命都掌握在你们（指干部）手里，要我们怎么就怎么。”社里长期存在着出勤率很高，劳动效率很低的现象。
    中共江苏省委发出了有关改进干部作风、开展民主办社讨论的通报以后，省委有关部门派人来这个社了解民主办社的情况。社的党支部就在7月5日组织干部学习省委的通报。但学习的目的和要求，以及如何学都没有很好研究，仅读了读文件，大家都很肤浅地漫谈几次、检查一番就算结束了。
    7月25日，县委书记连续两次到这个社来检查民主办社的学习情况，这样又重新开始学。但县委对民主办社的讨论没有作过具体部署，也没有提出具体要求。县委书记来这个社，只是听听汇报，并未作具体指示。因此，这次学习并不比前次好，干脆连文件也没有读，一开始就要大家检查。学习目的仍不明确，引起了一些混乱思想。有的社干部说：“这是领导上拆我们的后台”，错误地认为实行民主办社是整干部；有的干部认为民主办社学习是上级交代的任务，把它当成额外负担。社员群众听说要实行民主办社，都很兴奋，对民主要求很迫切。领导方面对民主办社的目的和意义都还没有弄清楚，自然不能正确地满足群众民主办社的要求。因此，学习期间，在个别生产队里发生了一些不正常的现象。如第八队的社员对队长意见很大，要求召开社员大会讨论生产计划，公开账目，要队长对某些问题作必要的解释，可是迟迟得不到答复，社员们就半天不下田生产。
    该社党支部看到这些情况，对民主办社怀疑起来，害怕搞乱了，只好草草了事。以布置秋收秋种工作为名，各队开了一次社员大会，作了一些说明就算了。只有问题特别严重的队（如第八队）才专门开了会，让干部作了检讨。这样一来，民主办社像一阵风一样，从这个社轻轻吹过去了。
    这次学习，对改进领导作风多少也起了一些作用。比如，有些干部决定事情时，从来不和群众商量的，现在已经开始听听群众意见了；社里也曾召开了一次老农座谈会座谈生产改革的问题；有些干部也进行了个别访问，了解群众的要求。但因为社干部没有真正从认识上解决问题，必要的民主制度没有建立起来，学习过去不多久，老问题又出现了，而且干部也学乖了。如副社长尚子龙就说，扣工分是强迫，不好听，以后就叫“赔”工分好了。第四队把村边田的产量全包给社员，规定如果少收了，就由各户按养鸡的数量平均摊派赔偿，否则就不准养鸡。第一队、第九队的干部都认为不扣工分不行，他们说：“社员要上天，你也跟着飞上天，不扣工分，这些调皮户怎么办”？这些队又恢复到进行民主办社讨论以前的情况了。
    龙华社的这些情况，提出了一个值得注意的问题：民主办社，对干部进行群众路线的教育，这是一个长期任务，如果县委不深入实际，不对基层干部进行具体帮助，这样就可能使民主办社只热闹一阵，解决不了工作中的实际问题。
