Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 28th. Preparatory work for the first year of the seven-year plan to essentially eliminate schistosomiasis was largely completed in 1956.

The Third National Schistosomiasis Control Conference held in Shanghai summarized the work experience and lessons of this year, and determined the key points of the prevention and control work for 1957.

According to statistics from twelve provinces and cities, in 1956, provinces, cities, counties, districts, and even some agricultural production cooperatives established prevention and control organizations. A total of more than 84,000 prevention and control personnel were trained, and surveys of patients and the intermediate host of schistosomiasis – the Oncomelania hupensis snail – were conducted in epidemic areas. Some areas also launched large-scale snail eradication efforts, and snail eradication work has been carried out on more than 150 million square meters of area. Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other places have seen villages and towns where snails have been completely eliminated. This year, about 400,000 schistosomiasis patients were treated across the country. This figure is more than double the total number of people treated in the previous six years.

The conference believes that extensive and in-depth publicity and education, mobilizing the masses, closely integrating scientific and technological work with the masses, and closely integrating prevention and control work with agricultural production and water conservancy projects are the three main links in launching the prevention and control struggle. Local experience proves that as long as there is a unified understanding and proper arrangements are made, it is entirely possible to ensure that production and prevention/control do not interfere with each other.

During the discussion of the key points of prevention and control for 1957, the representatives attending the meeting determined a plan to treat 1,215,000 people nationwide in 1957. They also agreed to earnestly promote the three-day treatment method in areas where conditions permit, carry out mobile and residential treatment in rural areas, and implement outpatient treatment on a trial basis in cities and towns. Treatment work will be organized with the cooperation of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. In terms of snail eradication, various methods will be adopted by various regions according to different conditions, emphasizing attention to quality and effectiveness and preventing formalism. Snail eradication work should proceed from near to far, from points to areas, and gradually achieve complete elimination. In 1957, the primary goal is to eliminate snails within half a li to one li around residential water areas and villages, and then expand outwards. In epidemic areas, it is required to basically implement human waste management to achieve the purpose of accumulating fertilizer and killing eggs, while universally carrying out publicity and education on safe water use and personal protection to the masses.

The conference put forward tasks for scientific research work in 1957. It requires scientific researchers in various regions to especially focus on studying the ecology of Oncomelania hupensis snails and improve oral medications, and to find new and more effective drugs and prevention methods.

This conference was held from December 24th to 27th. Those present at the meeting included the leaders of the Party committees and governments of twelve provinces and cities, and the directors (bureaus) of the health departments.

    全国血吸虫病防治会议确定明年工作要点
    一百二十万血吸虫病人将得到治疗
    新华社上海28日电　七年内基本消灭血吸虫病的第一年准备工作，已经在1956年大体完成。
    在上海举行的第三次全国血吸虫病防治会议总结了这一年的工作经验和教训，并且确定了1957年防治工作的要点。
    会议根据十二个省市的统计，1956年各省、市、县、区以至部分农业生产合作社都设立了防治组织，共训练了八万四千多个防治人员，在流行地区进行了对病人和血吸虫中间宿主——钉螺的调查摸底工作。有的地区同时展开了大规模的灭螺工作，各地已在一亿五千多万平方公尺面积上进行消灭钉螺的工作。江苏、安徽、浙江和上海等地已出现了完全消灭钉螺的乡和村庄。这一年，各地还治疗了四十万左右血吸虫病人。这个数字比前六年治疗的总人数还增加了一倍多。
    会议认为，广泛深入进行宣传教育，发动群众，使科学技术工作同群众密切结合和防治工作同农业生产水利工程密切结合是展开防治斗争的三个主要环节。各地经验证明，只要认识一致、安排得当，生产和防治两不误是完全可能的。
    到会的代表在讨论1957年防治要点中，确定了1957年全国治疗一百二十一万五千人的计划，并且在有条件的地区认真推行三天疗法，在农村进行巡回驻社治疗，在城镇试行门诊治疗。治疗工作将组织中西医合作进行。在灭螺方面，由各地按照不同条件采用不同方法进行，强调注意质量和效果，防止形式主义。灭螺工作要由近到远、由点到面、由局部逐步达到全部消灭，1957年首先作到生活用水地区和村庄周围的半华里到一华里内消灭钉螺，然后向外推开。在病疫流行地区，要求基本上实行人粪管理，达到积肥灭卵的目的，同时普遍地向群众进行安全用水和个人防护的宣传教育。
    会议对于1957年的科学研究工作提出了任务。要求各地科学研究人员特别着重研究钉螺的生态和改进口服药剂，并且找寻新的更为有效的药物和预防方法。
    这次会议是在12月24日到27日举行的。到会的有十二个省市的党委和政府负责人和卫生厅（局）长。
