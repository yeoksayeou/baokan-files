Socialist Countries Greet the New Year with New Achievements
·Soviet Union·
Light Industry Completes This Year's Production Plan Ahead of Schedule

The enterprises under the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule on December 26, producing a total of 10 billion rubles more industrial products than last year. The output of high-quality products that are in great demand by residents has increased particularly significantly. For example, silk fabrics increased by 230 million meters compared to last year, linen fabrics increased by 75 million meters, and shoes increased by 16.5 million pairs. In addition, sewing products worth 2.5 billion rubles were produced. Product quality has improved, and the variety of products has also increased. These are the results of more rational use of equipment and production area, mastery of new technologies, and advanced operating procedures. Many new equipment in newly built enterprises in various places have been put into production. Output will be further expanded next year.

Incomes of Collective Farms Across the Country Generally Increase

Due to the bumper harvest this year, the incomes of collective farms across the Soviet Union have generally increased. The cash income of collective farms in the Kazakh Republic will increase to two and a half times that of 1953, and the total cash amount used to pay labor day remuneration to collective farm members has increased to five times that of 1953. In the first ten months of this year, the income of collective farms in the Moscow region increased by 33%. In the Altai Krai, the main reclamation area, more than 800 collective farms have become "million-ruble farms" with incomes of more than one million rubles. The average income per working day of collective farms throughout the Krai has increased to twice that of 1953.

Due to the increase in income, collective farms in various places have carried out various large-scale capital construction projects, and the purchasing power of collective farm members has also increased. Collective farms in Belarus used a large amount of funds this year to build livestock sheds, warehouses, cultural and living facilities, power stations, and houses. 25,000 houses have been built. Collective farms in Kazakhstan are now building about 50,000 houses. The value of food and cultural appliances sold in rural areas this year is almost 500 million rubles more than last year.
