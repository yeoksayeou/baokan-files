Upon their arrival, a large group of villagers immediately invited the Premier to pull open the yellow curtain hanging on the wall of a new brick building, thus declaring the opening of the Maternal and Child Health Center presented to the villagers by Prime Minister Nehru. Behind the yellow curtain was a stone tablet inscribed with: "Unveiled on December 6, 1956, by His Excellency Zhou Enlai, of the People's Republic of China."

　　Kulipantandalam Village is one of more than a million villages in India where the government is implementing rural development plans to increase production and improve living standards.

　　The guests toured the clean and tidy Maternal and Child Health Center. Accompanied by the villagers, they then walked along the streets to the village entertainment center. The streets were hung with rows of Chinese and Indian national flags, and arches woven from coconut and palm leaves were also erected. Children waved flags, and they, along with the men and women villagers, enthusiastically cheered the guests.

　　Subsequently, the guests were invited to the front of the stage in the center of the square, where six girls dressed in red, yellow, and blue outer garments and skirts sang prayer songs in Tamil. They also performed graceful Indian dances.

　　The chairman of the Village Development Committee presented Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier He Long with large garlands woven from light red roses. In his welcoming address, he said: "We now have schools, children's health centers, open-air theaters, and other welfare facilities that are essential for improving rural life. Today, we have embarked on the road to progress, and we hope to see our village become much better than the cities in the near future. We will, to a large extent, live up to the wishes of our beloved Prime Minister."

　　周总理参观印度农村和工厂
    据新华社马德拉斯7日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理等一行6日上午参观了离马德拉斯大约四十英里的库利潘坦达拉姆村。他们一到达那里，一大群村民马上就把总理请去拉开挂在一座新砖房墙上的黄色帷幕，于是尼赫鲁总理送给村民们的这所妇幼保健站就宣布开幕了。黄色帷幕后面有一块石碑，上面刻着：“1956年12月6日由中华人民共和国周恩来阁下揭幕”。
    库利潘坦达拉姆村是印度政府推行增加生产和提高生活水平的乡村发展计划的一百万多个村庄中的一个。
    客人们参观了这座整洁的妇幼保健站。接着他们在村民们陪送下走过街道，前往村娱乐中心。街道上挂着许多排中印两国国旗，并且还搭着用椰子和棕榈叶编扎的拱门。孩子们挥着旗子，他们和男女村民一起向客人们热烈欢呼。
    随后，客人们被请到场中央的台前，有六个姑娘穿着红色、黄色和蓝色的外衣和裙子用泰米尔语唱了祈祷的歌。她们还表演了优美的印度舞蹈。
    村发展委员会主席向周恩来总理和贺龙副总理献了用浅红色玫瑰花编成的大花环。他在致词欢迎客人们的时候说：“我们现在有了学校、儿童保健站、露天剧场和对提高农村生活非常必要的其他一些福利设施，今天我们已经走上前进的道路，我们希望不久就能看到我们的村庄变得比城市还要好得多，我们在很大程度上不辜负我们亲爱的总理的祝愿。”
    周恩来总理致答词，他的讲话译成了泰米尔语，激起了热烈的欢呼。他说，他同印度兄弟姐妹们见了面，十分高兴，他代表中国农民向他们致以亲切的慰问。他称赞他们所取得的劳动成果和他们的各种成就。
    周恩来同村民谈话，向他们询问了土地产量和生活情况。
    据新华社马德拉斯7日电　周恩来总理和贺龙副总理等一行在6日下午参观了马德拉斯附近的印度国营火车车厢工厂。周恩来总理说这个工厂是“东方的光荣”。
    周恩来参观全厂以后，在这个工厂的机械工人大会上讲了话。他在工人们的欢呼声中说，这个工厂是经过精密的计划而建成的，生产组织也十分良好。他说：“东方的人民可以为这个工厂而感到自豪。”
    管理处长萨德戈潘把一个车厢模型赠送给中国领导人员。
