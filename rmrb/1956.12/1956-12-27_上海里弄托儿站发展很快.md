Shanghai Neighborhood Nursery Stations Develop Rapidly

In the second half of this year, more than 300 new neighborhood nursery stations were established in Shanghai. The subsidy funds allocated by the municipal and district civil affairs departments for the establishment of neighborhood nursery stations increased from 30,000 yuan in the first half of the year to 110,000 yuan. This year, the municipal trade union organization also allocated 300,000 yuan as subsidy funds. The Real Estate Management Bureau has made every effort to give priority to the housing needed by neighborhood nursery stations, and has mobilized residents to move and exchange some houses. The Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation and the municipal and district health departments have also trained thousands of childcare workers for the newly built neighborhood nursery stations.

    上海里弄托儿站发展很快
    今年下半年，上海新建立了三百多个里弄托儿站。市、区民政部门为开办里弄托儿站而拨的补助经费，由上半年的三万元增加到了十一万元；市工会组织今年也拨出了三十万元作为补助经费。房地产管理局对里弄托儿站所需要的房屋，尽力给予优先照顾，并且动员住户迁让、对调了一部分房屋。上海市民主妇女联合会和市、区卫生部门还为新建的里弄托儿站培养了成千的保育人员。
