Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, December 11th: Zhao Lequn (Zhuang nationality), Vice Governor of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, reported on the work of the past year at the fourth anniversary celebration of the establishment of the Autonomous Prefecture last night.

Zhao Lequn said that in the past year, more than 97% of farmers in the Autonomous Prefecture have joined more than 6,000 agricultural and forestry production cooperatives, and the entire prefecture has basically achieved agricultural collectivization. Due to being organized, farmers of all ethnic groups overcame severe natural disasters such as floods, droughts, wind, and insects that have not been seen for many years in the second half of this year. The total grain output of the prefecture not only did not decrease but also slightly increased.

Zhao Lequn said that in terms of industrial construction, the Autonomous Prefecture has newly built three mechanized sugar factories and one mechanized oil press that presses 16 tons of peanuts per day this year. With the continuous establishment of new factories, the local minority ethnic working class has begun to grow. According to statistics from 36 factories, Zhuang, Miao, and Yao workers account for more than 18% of the total number of workers.

Zhao Lequn said that a warm movement to learn the Zhuang language will appear in the Autonomous Prefecture this winter and next spring. The prefecture's forty-eight Zhuang language schools are being prepared, and a large number of cadres to promote the Zhuang language have been trained. It is expected that by May next year, about 600,000 young and middle-aged farmers will enter spare-time cultural classes to learn the Zhuang language. (Attached pictures)

    桂西僮族自治州　年来建设有成绩
    据新华社南宁11日电　桂西僮族自治州副州长赵乐群（僮族）在昨晚举行的自治州成立四周年纪念会上报告了最近一年来的工作。
    赵乐群说，这一年来，自治州已经有97％以上的农户加入六千多个农业和林业生产合作社，全州已经基本上实现农业合作化。由于组织起来，今年下半年各族农民战胜了多年未有的水旱风虫等严重自然灾害，全州粮食总产量不但没有减产，并且还略有增加。
    赵乐群说，在工业建设方面，自治州今年新建成三个机械化糖厂和一个每天榨十六吨花生仁的机械化榨油厂。随着新工厂的不断建立，本地少数民族工人阶级已经开始成长起来。据三十六个工厂的统计，僮、苗、瑶族工人已经占工人总数18％以上。
    赵乐群说，今冬明春自治州将有一个热烈学习僮文的运动出现。全州四十八所僮文学校正着手筹建，一大批推行僮文的工作干部已经训练出来。预计在明年5月以前，将有六十万左右的青壮年农民进入业余文化班学习僮文。（附图片）
