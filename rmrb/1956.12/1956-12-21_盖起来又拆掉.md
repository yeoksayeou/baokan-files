Built Up Only to Be Torn Down
　　Cheng Ji

    The workers of the Third Engineering Team of the First Engineering Company of the Changchun Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau have been painfully discussing one thing: a three-story building that they were about to finish this year encountered a rainstorm and became tilted, leaning and on the verge of collapse; it had to be completely torn down in the end.

    More than a hundred workers came to this nearly collapsed new building. This time they came not to build the house, but to tear it down; no longer to lay bricks and stones piece by piece, but to dismantle the bricks, stones, and mortar piece by piece. How sad they were, they asked: "Why waste the state's resources in vain?" According to incomplete statistics, the loss of state property totaled 22,000 yuan.

    What are the reasons for building this building only to tear it down? The result of the investigation is: before building this new building, there was no exploration and the geological conditions were not clarified, so the design was done hastily. Now it seems that this design was wrong. The Changchun Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau investigated the cause afterward and conducted exploration, only to discover that the foundation of the original designed building was very unsafe. The bearing capacity of the foundation was insufficient, and there was a large amount of sludge underneath, and the organic matter content of the soil was also too high. A three-story building cannot be built on such a foundation. However, before the design, there was no exploration, and these situations were unknown, so it was blindly decided to build a new building on this dangerous soil. After a rain, this error was quickly exposed. Even without the rain, this building would have problems sooner or later. Some people said: This heavy rain was a good thing, otherwise, the three-story building would have been completed and people would have lived in it, and it would be even worse if problems arose.

    Many lessons have long proven that without exploration data, one cannot design blindly. Why did the Changchun Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau forget this lesson and blindly design without exploration? It is said that it was for "quick commencement." At the time of the design, someone raised an opinion requesting exploration data before doing the design. However, the leaders of the Changchun Municipal Construction Engineering Bureau felt that exploration would take time and would not allow for quick commencement, so they did not accept this opinion and decided to make a design and start construction quickly without exploration data. What was the result of this "quickness"? It was to build it up and then tear it down.

    Some of our comrades only like "quickness" and do not like to hear about "stability." But "haste makes waste" – without a solid foundation, blindly seeking quickness cannot be quick. (Attached picture)

    盖起来又拆掉
  　成集
    长春市建筑工程局第一工程公司第三工程队的职工，一直都在痛心地谈论一件事情：他们今年快要盖好的一座三层楼房，遇到一场大雨，就东歪西斜，摇摇欲倒；最后不得不全部拆掉。
    一百多个工人来到了这座快要倒塌的新楼房前面。他们这次来，不是盖房子，而是拆房子；不再是一块块地砌上砖石，而是一块块地拆掉砖、石和灰浆。他们多么难过，他们问道：“为什么这样白白糟蹋国家财力呢？”根据不完全的统计，共损失国家财产两万两千元。
    这座楼房盖起来又拆掉的原因何在呢？调查的结果是：在新建这座楼房以前，没有勘探，没有弄清楚地质情况，就仓促设计。现在看来，这个设计是错误的。长春市建筑工程局事后追查原因，进行勘探，才发现原设计的楼房基础，很不安全。基础的承载力不够，下面又有大量淤泥，土壤的有机物含量也过大。在这样的基础上，是不能建筑三层楼的。但是设计之前，没有勘探，不知道这些情况，所以盲目地决定在这种危险的土壤上新建楼房。下了一场雨，就很快地暴露了这个错误。就是不下雨，这座楼房迟早也要出毛病。有人说：这场大雨下得好，要不然，三层楼房都盖成了，住了人，再出毛病，就更糟了。
    许多教训早已证明：没有勘探资料，就不能盲目设计。长春市建筑工程局为什么忘记这种教训，偏偏不勘探就盲目设计呢？据说是为了“快开工”。在设计的当时，有人提过意见，要求取得勘探资料，再做设计。但是，长春市建筑工程局领导人员觉得要勘探，就需要时间，就不能快开工，所以不接受这个意见，决定在没有勘探资料的条件下，快些做出设计，进行施工。这种“快”的结果是什么呢？是盖起来又拆掉。
    我们有些同志只喜欢“快”，总不大爱听“稳”。但是“欲速则不达”——没有稳固的基础，盲目地求快，是快不了的。（附图片）

    ——我是学爸爸设计的大楼。肖里
