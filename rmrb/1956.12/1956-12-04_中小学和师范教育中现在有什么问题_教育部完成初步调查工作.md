Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Lijun reports: The four investigation teams specially organized by the Ministry of Education have completed their investigations in various regions. Recently, at a series of meetings held by the Ministry of Education, they reported the preliminary results of their investigations and research. These reports focused on the understanding and implementation of the all-round development education policy, the problems existing in the teaching plans of primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools, the phenomenon of teachers being overwhelmed, and the contradiction between quantity and quality in the development of education.

According to the investigation teams, there have been significant achievements in the implementation of the all-round development education policy in various regions in recent years. Ordinary education has undergone fundamental changes. However, the Ministry of Education and the education departments of various provinces and cities have also made some shortcomings and errors in the understanding and implementation of the policy. In the past two years, there was a tendency to understand the five components of all-round development education in a fragmented and isolated manner, resulting in a situation where one aspect was emphasized at the expense of others in educational work. In the past year, the concept of all-round development has been understood as "average development," with excessive emphasis on the collective and neglect of the development of students' interests, specialties, and independent work abilities.

While studying the above problems in implementing the all-round development education policy, educators have developed several different understandings. Some people believe that although the all-round development education policy is correct, it is not perfect and that teaching students in accordance with their aptitude should also be listed as an education policy; in order to cultivate talents for socialist construction, different education should be given according to students' different interests, specialties, and requirements. Some people disagree with taking teaching students in accordance with their aptitude as an education policy, believing that the all-round development education policy includes the meaning of "all-round development of personality." The current neglect of the development of students' individual characteristics in education is only due to insufficient understanding of the policy. Others believe that in order to correct the current bias in work, it is also possible to propose teaching students in accordance with their aptitude as a policy, and then cancel it after the bias is overcome.

Recently, due to the confusion in educators' understanding of teaching students in accordance with their aptitude, when students unilaterally emphasized the development of "individuality" and were unwilling to participate in collective activities and social activities, many school teachers developed a mood of not daring to manage and fearing to manage.

The teaching plan is an important link in improving teaching quality. At present, the general situation of secondary school teaching plans is that junior high school is not emphasized, senior high school is more emphasized, and the third year of senior high school is particularly emphasized. The primary school teaching plan is generally not heavy, and the problem lies in the fact that the content of some courses, such as Chinese, has been increased and deepened, but the class time has been reduced instead. The main problem with teacher training teaching plans is that there are too many categories, especially the professional courses are set up too complicatedly, while the proportion of cultural courses in the teaching plan is too small. Many of the teacher training teaching syllabuses and textbooks are translated from the Soviet Union, and there is still a disconnect from the actual situation of teacher training education in China.

The investigation team believes that the reason why the phenomenon of teachers being overwhelmed has not been resolved for a long time is due to two reasons, one from outside the school and one from inside the school. The reason from outside the school is that many departments currently directly assign tasks to schools, and some even arbitrarily transfer school leaders and teachers to participate in social central work, resulting in school leaders holding multiple positions, having many meetings, teachers having many social activities, and heavy workloads. The job transfers of many school leaders and teachers, especially primary school teachers, are frequent. Some units also arbitrarily occupy school buildings, especially primary school buildings. Within the school, tight staffing, heavy tasks, and an excessive burden of non-teaching activities are also important reasons why teachers cannot conduct teaching research work or rest well. Some primary and secondary schools still retain some unreasonable work systems, such as emphasizing collective lesson preparation. This frustrates the enthusiasm and creativity of the majority of teachers in carefully studying teaching materials, and also becomes a burden for some teachers with higher levels. In organizing teachers' studies, there are also situations where there are multiple leaders and the content of studies is progressing simultaneously.

The investigation team believes that ordinary education has made great progress this year. Enrollment plans for schools at all levels have been overfulfilled, and the knowledge quality of new students has improved compared to last year. However, due to considering many needs and not considering subjective conditions enough, the contradiction between quantity and quality is more acute and prominent this year than in previous years. Since the beginning of the school year, the situation of crowded school buildings and simple equipment has been relatively common. Many primary and secondary schools in various regions have implemented a two-shift system, and some have even adopted a three-shift system. The number of students in each class has been expanded to 60 to 75. The situation is even more difficult in newly established middle schools and junior high school classes established in primary schools. There is an insufficient number of middle school teachers and the quality is poor. 70% to 80% of the new teachers added to middle schools this year have a middle school education level. In some areas, there are still teacher vacancies after the start of the school year. This makes it impossible to guarantee the improvement of education quality.

The Ministry of Education is conducting further investigations and research on the above issues and other important issues, and the second batch of investigation teams will set off soon.

### 中小学和师范教育中现在有什么问题　教育部完成初步调查工作

　  中小学和师范教育中现在有什么问题
　　教育部完成初步调查工作
    据新华社2日讯　新华社记者张丽君报道：教育部专门组织的四个调查组，在各地调查完毕后，近来在教育部召开的一系列的会议上，汇报了他们初步调查研究的结果。这些汇报着重在对全面发展的教育方针的认识和实施情况、中小学和师范学校教学计划中存在的问题、教师的忙乱现象、教育事业发展中的数量和质量的矛盾等方面。
    据调查组了解，几年来各地在贯彻执行全面发展教育方针的工作上，是有很大的成绩的。普通教育工作已经有了根本性的变化。但是，教育部和各省市教育部门在方针的认识上和贯彻执行的过程中，也发生了若干的缺点和错误。在前两年曾发生过片面地割裂地理解全面发展教育的五个组成部分，因而在教育工作中发生了顾此失彼的情况。最近一年来，又产生了把全面发展理解为“平均发展”，过分地强调集体，忽视学生爱好特长的发展和独立工作能力的培养。
    在研究贯彻全面发展教育方针中的上述问题时，教育工作者又产生了几种不同的认识。有的人认为全面发展的教育方针虽然正确，但不够完善，应将因材施教也列为教育方针；为了培养社会主义建设人才，应该根据学生不同的爱好、特长和要求给予不同的教育。有的人不同意把因材施教作为教育方针，认为全面发展的教育方针就包括“个性的全面发展”的涵义。目前在教育工作中忽视学生个性特长的发展，只是由于对方针的理解不够。也有人认为，为了纠正当前工作中的偏向，也可以把因材施教作为方针提出，在偏向得到克服后再取消。
    最近一个时期，由于教育工作者对因材施教的认识上存在着混乱思想，在学生片面地强调发展“个性”，不愿参加集体活动和社会活动时，不少学校的教师产生了不敢管和怕管的情绪。
    教学计划是提高教学质量的重要环节。目前，中学教学计划的情况一般是初中不重，高中较重，高三尤其重。小学教学计划，一般并不重，问题在于有些课程，如语文的教材内容加多、加深了，但上课时间反而减少。师范教学计划主要是门类太多，尤其是专业科的设置过于繁琐，而文化课在教学计划中的比重却太少。师范的教学大纲和教材，很多是翻译苏联的，还存在着同中国师范教育实际脱节的情况。
    调查组认为，教师忙乱的现象所以长期未能解决，有来自校外和校内的两个原因。来自校外的原因是，目前许多部门直接向学校布置任务，有的还任意抽调学校的领导骨干和教师去参加社会中心工作，造成学校领导人兼职多、会议多、教师社会活动多、工作负担重的情况。很多学校领导人和教师，特别是小学教师的工作调动频繁。有的单位还任意占用学校校舍，特别是占用小学校舍。在学校内部，编制紧，任务重，非教学活动负担过重，也是影响教师不能很好地进行教学研究工作或休息的重要原因。部分的小学和中学还保留着一些不合理的工作制度，如强调集体备课。这样，既挫伤了广大教师认真钻研教材的积极性和创造性，对于一部分水平较高的教师也成为负担。在组织教师学习方面，还存在着领导多头，学习内容齐头并进的情况。
    调查组认为，今年普通教育事业有了很大的发展。各级学校招生计划都超额完成，新生知识质量较去年有所提高。但是由于考虑需要方面较多，考虑主观条件不够，所以今年表现在数量和质量上的矛盾比往年更为尖锐、突出。开学以来，学校校舍拥挤、设备简陋的情况比较普遍。各地中小学很多实行了二部制，有的还采用了三部制。班级人数有的每班扩大到六十到七十五人。各地新成立的中学和在小学里设立的初中班，情况就更加困难。中等学校师资数量不足，质量较差。今年中等学校新增加的师资，70％到80％是中等学校文化水平。有的地区在开学以后，教师仍有缺额。这就使教育质量的提高不能保证。
    教育部正就上述问题和其他重要问题作进一步的调查研究，第二批调查组即将出发。
