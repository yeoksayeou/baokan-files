    Strange Trade Practices
    In some places, many strange trade practices have emerged.
    Contract Cancellations
    Recently, some commercial units have been requesting the cancellation of contracts signed with other units. The Fruit Management Office of the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has recently received letters from units in Guangxi, Hunan, Guizhou, Gansu, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, requesting the cancellation of contracts originally signed with them. The letter from the Guangxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Non-Staple Food Management Office stated: "Except for individual varieties designated by the central government for our province to execute, all other contracts will be cancelled." The reasons given by these units for requesting the cancellation of contracts are: "Reduced production," "Increased export tasks," "Unable to control the source of goods after the opening of the free market," and so on. These reasons are untenable. The contracts for dried and fresh fruits signed by various localities and units this year are generally more realistic. The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives held a meeting in September this year to balance the plan for dried and fresh fruits, and revised some unrealistic contracts. By September, the production situation of dried and fresh fruits in various places had been determined, and some units had already started purchasing, while others were in the process of purchasing. Generally speaking, the contracts revised at this meeting were relatively practical and feasible. The units proposing to cancel the contracts mostly want to control more of the materials needed in the market within their own units and are unwilling to let "others" take the goods away.
    Barter Trade
    Recently, "barter trade" has become popular in many provincial and county supply and marketing cooperatives. If you don't give me something, I won't give you something. "Two hundred dan of red melon seeds for four hundred dan of dried lychees," "Bananas for lotus seeds".... When it is time for these units to fulfill their contracts, they say "no goods," but when you offer to trade something with them, they say they have goods.
    Tying Hot Goods with Cold Goods
    This is also a popular trading method recently. Some commercial units, after controlling a large amount of materials, have become commercial "bullies," and other commercial units have to listen to their "commands." If you want a certain kind of goods from them, they will tie it with several kinds of cold goods that you don't need. For example, if you want lotus seeds, they will tie it with dried water caltrop. Some units, in order to get certain goods, have to reluctantly accept unwanted goods.
    How can these trade practices be compatible with the essence of socialist commercial work? Aren't some of the "tense" atmospheres in certain markets created by these strange trade practices? Put them away as soon as possible!

### 奇怪的贸易方式

    奇怪的贸易方式
    在一些地方出现了许多奇怪的贸易方式。
    撤销合同
    近来有些商业单位纷纷要求撤销和别的单位订的合同。广东省供销合作社水果经营管理处，最近陆续接到广西、湖南、贵州、甘肃、江苏、江西、山西、黑龙江、新疆维吾尔自治区等地一些单位来信，要求撤销原来同他们签订的合同。广西省供销社副食品经营处的信上说：“除个别品种由中央指定分配我省执行外，其他合同一律注销。”这些单位要求撤销合同的理由是：“减产了”，“出口任务增加了”，“开放自由市场后掌握不到货源了”，等等。这些理由是站不住脚的。今年各地各单位订立的干鲜果合同，一般是比较切合实际的，供销合作总社今年9月曾召开了一次关于平衡干鲜果计划的会议，重新修订了一些不切合实际的合同。9月间，各地干鲜果产量情况已经定局，有的单位已经收购起来，有的正在收购；一般说来，这次会议上修订的合同，是比较切实可行的。提出要撤销合同的单位，多数是为了使本单位能更多掌握市场上所需要的物资，不愿让东西给“人家”拿走。
    物物交易
    最近，不少省、县供销合作社流行着“物物交换”的贸易方式。你不给我东西，我就不给你东西。“二百担红瓜子换四百担荔枝干”，“香蕉换莲子”……。要这些单位执行合同的时候便说“没有货”，拿东西同他们换的时候就说有货了。
    热货搭冷货
    这也是近来流行着的一种贸易方式。一些商业单位掌握较多的物资以后，就成为商业上的“霸王”了，别的商业单位都得听它“指挥”，你如果向他要某种货，他就给你搭几样你不需要的冷货。例如，你要莲子，就给你搭菱角干。有些单位为了能拿到某种货物，只得忍痛收下不需要的货物。
    这些贸易方式，岂是同社会主义商业工作的实质可以相容的？某些市场上的某些“紧张”气氛，不正是这些奇怪的贸易方式制造出来的吗？及早地收起它们吧！
