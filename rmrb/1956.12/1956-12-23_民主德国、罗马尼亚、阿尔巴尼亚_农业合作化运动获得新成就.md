East Germany, Romania, Albania
New Achievements in Agricultural Cooperativization Movements
East Germany
East German Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Reichelt, wrote an editorial in "Neues Deutschland" on December 4th, titled: "Socialist Construction in the Countryside Marches Towards New Achievements."

The editorial stated: The total number of cooperatives in East Germany has reached six thousand two hundred and eighty-seven. Two hundred and forty of these were added last year. Today, the land cultivated by cooperatives accounts for 23% of the country's arable land, compared to only 19.7% at the end of last year. In the fourth quarter of this year, middle peasants have participated more widely in agricultural production cooperatives.

When discussing the increase in agricultural cooperative yields, he cited the Woken Cooperative in Neubrandenburg as an example, saying that the yield per hectare of winter wheat had increased from 2,400 kilograms last year to 3,500 kilograms this year, and winter barley had increased from 2,200 kilograms to 3,200 kilograms.

Reichelt then said that along with agricultural cooperativization, the government is vigorously equipping machine tractor stations with the latest tractors and machines to improve agricultural production. For example, the new "Ultrac" tracked self-loading harvester, as well as potato and grain combine harvesters, were used for the first time this year.

He also said, "Many individual farmers who are still skeptical about joining agricultural production cooperatives have formed year-round work teams. They have signed more than seven thousand work contracts with machine and tractor stations to make fuller use of machines and cultivate their land more quickly."

He wrote that now, "even those who oppose our socialist construction cannot deny the development of our agricultural production cooperatives."

Romania
In the past year, Romania's socialist transformation of agriculture has made great progress. From December of last year to the end of November this year, the number of collective farms and joint cultivation associations has increased from six thousand three hundred and twenty-five to more than ten thousand three hundred, the number of peasant households participating in these agricultural units has increased from three hundred and eighty-two thousand to more than six hundred and fifty thousand, and the total area of collectively cultivated land has increased from one million three hundred and twenty thousand hectares to one million eight hundred and thirteen thousand hectares.

In Constanta Oblast, 71.44% of peasant households have joined collective farms and joint cultivation associations, and the land area owned by these units accounts for 74.62% of the total arable land in the oblast.

Although Romania experienced a drought this year, socialist agriculture has still demonstrated its superiority. For example, in the Tirgsoru-Vechi collective farm in Ploiesti Oblast, the wheat yield per hectare was 1,800 kilograms, while individual farmers here did not even receive half of that amount. In the Varias collective farm in Timisoara Oblast, the wheat yield per hectare this year was 1,949 kilograms, the barley yield per hectare was 2,605 kilograms, and the corn yield per hectare was 4,180 kilograms. With the increase in yields, the cash income of these collective farms has also increased significantly.

Albania
Albania's agricultural cooperativization movement has made tremendous progress this year. Since the beginning of this year, a total of 536 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the country, which is 218 more than the total number of agricultural cooperatives established in the country in the past few years.

The 854 existing agricultural cooperatives in the country cultivate land that accounts for about 30% of the country's arable land, and state farms cultivate more than 9% of the country's arable land.

In the agricultural cooperativization movement, most of the middle peasants have begun to join cooperatives. The results of cooperativization are best in the plains areas of Devoll, Delvina, and Lushnja. Some of these areas have already or are close to fully realizing cooperativization. Although the climatic conditions this year were not good, most of the cooperatives have achieved better harvests. Some cooperatives have even tripled their income this year compared to the past.

### 民主德国、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚  农业合作化运动获得新成就

    民主德国、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚
    农业合作化运动获得新成就
    民主德国
    民主德国农林部长赖希尔特12月4日在“新德意志报”上写了一篇社论，题目是：“农村社会主义建设向新的成就进军”。
    社论说：民主德国现有的合作社的总数已经达到了六千二百八十七个。其中二百四十个是去年增加的。今天，合作社所耕种的土地占全国耕地的23％，去年年底只占19.7％。在今年第四季内，中农已经更广泛地参加了农业生产合作社。
    他在谈到农业合作社产量增加的情况时举出纽勃兰登堡的沃肯合作社为例说，这个合作社的冬小麦的每公顷产量已经从去年的二千四百公斤增加到今年的三千五百公斤，冬大麦从二千二百公斤增加到了三千二百公斤。
    赖希尔特接着说，在农业合作化的同时，政府在大力用最新式的拖拉机和机器把机器拖拉机站装备起来，以改进农业的生产。例如，今年第一次使用了“乌尔特腊克”履带式新型自动装载收割机以及马铃薯和谷物的联合收割机。
    他还说，“许多对加入农业生产合作社仍然抱有怀疑的个体农民已经组成了常年的工作组合。他们同机器和拖拉机站签订了七千多个工作合同以便更充分地使用机器和更快地耕种他们的土地。”
    他写道，现在，“在反对我们社会主义建设的人也不能否认我们的农业生产合作社的发展。”
    罗马尼亚
    在过去一年中，罗马尼亚农业社会主义改造有了很大进展。从去年12月到今年11月底，集体农庄和联合耕种社的数目已经从六千三百二十五个增加到一万零三百多个，参加这些农业单位的农户已经从三十八万二千户增加到六十五万多户，集体耕种的土地总面积也已经从一百三十二万公顷增加到一百八十一万三千多公顷。
    在康斯坦萨州，已经有71.44％的农户参加了集体农庄和联合耕种社，这些单位拥有的土地面积占这个州的耕地总面积的74.62％。
    虽然今年在罗马尼亚曾经发生过旱灾，但是社会主义的农业仍然表现了它的优越性。例如，在普罗什蒂州蒂尔格索鲁佛基的集体农庄，小麦每公顷的收获量是一千八百公斤，而这里的个体农户连这个数目的一半都没有收到。在底密索拉州瓦里亚斯的集体农庄，今年小麦每公顷的收获量是一千九百四十九公斤，大麦每公顷的收获量是二千六百零五公斤，玉米每公顷的收获量是四千一百八十公斤。随着收获量的提高，这些集体农庄的现款收入也有了显著的增加。
    阿尔巴尼亚
    阿尔巴尼亚农业合作化运动今年有了巨大的发展。今年以来全国共成立了五百三十六个新的农业生产合作社，比过去几年中全国建立的农业合作社的总数还多二百一十八个。
    全国现有的八百五十四个农业合作社耕种的土地，约占全国耕地面积的30％，国营农场的耕地占全国耕地面积的9％以上。
    在农业合作化运动中，大部分中农已开始加入合作社。在德伏利、德尔维那、鲁施尼亚等平原地区，合作化的成绩最好。这些地区有的已经或者接近全部实现合作化。虽然今年的气候条件不好，但是合作社大部分都取得了较好的收成。有些合作社今年的收入还比过去增加了三倍。　（新华社）
