According to Taiwanese newspaper reports, US monopoly capital continues to increase its investments in Taiwan. Mr. Schwartzvelt, General Manager of the US Ebasco Services Incorporated, arrived in Taipei at the beginning of this month to discuss with senior officials of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, such as Chen Cheng, Yu Hongjun, and Jiang Shao, about the establishment of a steel plant in Taiwan with American capital. The Taiwan branch of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which already controls Taiwan's electricity industry, also intends to invest in this planned steel plant. The news has caused panic among Taiwan's privately-owned steel industry. For several years, due to the heavy tax squeeze by the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the dumping of American products in Taiwan, products from Taiwan-owned enterprises such as Tang Eng Iron Works and Tatung Steel Machinery Company have experienced sluggish sales and business difficulties. If the United States establishes a steel plant in Taiwan with preferential conditions, Taiwan's existing steel factories will be in an even more desperate situation. Representatives of Taiwan's steel industry expressed their opinions to senior officials of the Chiang Kai-shek clique on December 3, hoping to first help open up sales channels for Taiwan-produced steel products and improve existing steelmaking equipment before implementing the plan to allow Americans to set up factories.

The "China Man-Made Fiber Corporation Toufen Factory," located in Toufen Township, Miaoli County, Taiwan, has recently started trial operation. The US Fenco Company has invested US$250,000 in this factory. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's Executive Yuan recently also approved an investment of US$500,000 by the US Daru Lin Company in Taiwan's Yangzi Timber Company, allowing American capital to control a majority of the shares of this timber company. Prior to this, the US Gulf Oil Corporation's investment in Taiwan's "China Petroleum Corporation" reached US$2 million, and American technicians were sent to explore Taiwan's oil mines for exploitation.

The conditions for US monopoly capital investment in Taiwan are very harsh. After the Taiwan Power Company was infiltrated by the capital forces of the US Westinghouse Electric Corporation, even electricity rates, power supply, and company personnel appointments and removals were subject to interference and control by American representatives. The investment of the US Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation even swallowed up the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation, reorganizing it into the "Ingalls Taiwan Shipbuilding & Drydock Corporation." Fearing that it would arouse even greater indignation among the Taiwanese people, the Chiang Kai-shek clique dared not disclose the contents of most of the investment contracts signed with various American companies.

Taiwanese newspapers reported that many shops and factories in Taiwan have recently closed down. In Chiayi City, six shoe factories alone have gone out of business. Quanchun Rice Mill, which has been operating in Toufen Township, Miaoli County for more than ten years, as well as many shops such as Baoma Car Dealership and Jinji Trading Company in Taipei City, have also been forced to close down recently. These closed factories and shops are all heavily in debt.

Taiwanese newspapers said that the declining purchasing power of Taiwanese society, the sluggish market, and the heavy tax squeeze by the Chiang Kai-shek clique are the main reasons for the closure of privately-owned industrial and commercial businesses in Taiwan.

Reports say that privately-owned industrial and commercial businesses in Taiwan that are barely maintaining operations are also in dire straits. Many factories are in a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown due to lack of sales for their products and difficulties in capital turnover. For example, most of the factories of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation are currently experiencing very difficult operations. At present, many shops in Taiwan rely on high-interest loans to survive. The minimum interest rate for high-interest loans is five yuan per hundred yuan per month.

### 美国垄断资本继续增加  当地工商业户纷纷倒闭

    美国垄断资本继续增加  当地工商业户纷纷倒闭
    据台湾报纸消息，美国垄断资本在台湾的投资继续增加。美国艾特那标准工程公司总经理史瓦斯维特在本月初到了台北，同蒋介石集团的高级官员陈诚、俞鸿钧、江杓等商谈美国资本在台湾投资设立钢铁厂的问题。已经控制了台湾电力工业的美国威斯汀豪斯电气公司台湾分公司，也打算向这个筹划中的钢铁厂投资。消息传出以后，引起了台湾民营钢铁工业界的恐慌。几年以来，由于蒋介石集团的重税压榨和美国制品在台湾倾销，使台湾企业界开设的唐荣铁工厂、大同制钢机械公司等产品滞销、经营困难。如果美国在台湾享有优惠条件开设钢铁厂，台湾原有的钢铁工厂将更加陷于绝境。台湾钢铁工业界代表在本月3日曾向蒋介石集团高级官员提出意见，希望首先帮助打开台湾省产钢铁制品的销路和改良现有炼钢设备，再实行让美国人设厂的计划。
    设立在台湾苗栗县头份镇的“中国人造纤维公司头份工厂”已经在最近开工试车，美国冯柯享公司对这家工厂投资二十五万美元。蒋介石集团行政院最近还批准了美国达杜林公司向台湾扬子木材公司投资五十万美元，使美国资本控制了这家木材公司的大部分股权。在这以前，美国海湾石油公司对台湾“中国石油公司”的投资达到二百万美元，并且派出美国技术人员到处勘探台湾的油矿，加以开采。
    美国垄断资本在台湾投资的条件非常苛刻，台湾电力公司被美国威斯汀豪斯电气公司资本势力渗透后，甚至电费高低、电力供应和公司人事任免等都受到美方代表的干涉和控制。美国英加尔斯造船公司的投资，更连台湾造船公司也吞并了，把它改组为“英加尔斯台湾造船船坞公司”。由于害怕引起台湾人民更大的愤慨，蒋介石集团对于同美国各个公司订立的投资合同的内容，大部分不敢公开。
    台湾报纸报道，最近台湾商店和工厂纷纷倒闭。在嘉义市，光是制鞋厂就倒闭了六家。苗栗县已经开设了十多年的泉春碾米厂、台北市宝马车行和金记商行等许多店户，最近也被迫关门。这些倒闭的工厂和商行都负债累累。
    台湾报纸说，台湾社会购买力日渐下降，市场萧条，加上蒋介石集团的重税压榨，是台湾民营工商业户纷纷倒闭的主要原因。
    消息说，现在勉强维持营业的台湾民营工商业户，也都陷入困境。许多工厂都因产品没有销路，资金周转困难，处在停工或半停工的状态。如台湾农林公司的大部分工厂现在经营都非常困难。目前台湾许多商店都靠高利贷款撑持下去。高利贷的利率最低也要每百元月息五元。
