    People Who Love Morning Exercises
    Jiang Guangyu

    In the winter morning, the Huangpu River is shrouded in a thin mist, and the sun has just risen from the horizon. People in Shanghai who love morning exercises begin to be active.

    On the Bund along the river, people in twos and threes are taking deep breaths facing the river. On the other side, groups of ten or eight are practicing martial arts, while others are skipping rope or doing freehand exercises. In another corner is a touching scene: a group of young men and women are practicing short-distance starts, waving their hats instead of using starting guns and commands. They are sports enthusiasts among the deaf and mute; Xu Xingzhang wrote the words on his palm to tell me that they come to exercise every morning; in the recent Shanghai Deaf and Mute Games, he won the second place in the 100-meter race.

    The Bund has been renovated since liberation, and many flowers and trees have been planted, making it more and more popular.

    People's Square is also a place for the people of Shanghai to exercise. Every morning when the loudspeaker sounds, people all over the square, without forming a formation, skillfully follow the music to do broadcast exercises. After the song is over, some even volunteer to count the beats and repeat it several times. The Youth League members of the Huangpu District stallholder corps are regulars here, and they also play badminton and skip rope.

    In the refreshing and quiet parks, people practicing Tai Chi are the earliest visitors. Most of them are elderly men and women and people suffering from chronic diseases. Some exercise alone, while others exercise in groups of dozens. Their movements appear light and slow, yet some are sweating. If someone asks them out of curiosity, they will tell you the reasons for practicing Tai Chi endlessly. Xu Dachao once mentioned that he used to have a bloated belly and felt uncomfortable eating, which led him to start practicing Tai Chi. An old man next to him, named Yang Bingyuan, also recounted his own experience; last year, his hand was numb, and acupuncture failed to cure it after several attempts. The doctor suggested that he use medical sports to solve the problem, so he followed a master to learn Tai Chi. …

    The sun gradually rises, and the people who do morning exercises, with a happy mood, head to offices, factories, and schools with a full spirit.

    爱早操的人们
    蒋光裕
    冬天的早晨，薄雾笼罩着黄浦江面，太阳刚从天边升起，上海市爱作早操的人们就开始活跃了。
    在临江大道的外滩，三三两两的人们在对着江面作深呼吸，另一旁，十个八个人在一起练武术，也有的在跳绳，作徒手操。另一角是一个动人的场面：一群青年男女正在练习短距离起跑，他们挥舞着帽子代替鸣枪和口令。他们是聋哑人中的体育爱好者；徐兴章把字写在手掌上告诉我，他们每天早晨都来锻炼；在最近上海举行的聋哑人运动会上，他曾获得百公尺赛跑第二名。
    外滩在解放以后经过整修，培植了许多花木，这里越来越受人喜爱了。
    人民广场，也是上海人民锻炼身体的地方。每当早晨扩音器响起的时候，满场不成队形的人们，很熟练地随着音乐作起广播操来。歌曲完了，有的还自告奋勇数着拍子重做几遍。黄浦区摊贩团支部的青年团员是这里的常客，他们还在这里打羽毛球和跳绳。
    在清爽幽静的公园里，打太极拳的人们是最早的游客。他们大多是老年男女和患慢性病的人，有的独自活动，也有数十人成队活动的。看来他们的动作轻巧缓慢，然而有的头上还冒出热气来。若有人带着好奇心问问他们，他们就滔滔不绝地告诉你打太极拳的理由。徐大超就曾谈到他过去肚皮发胀，吃东西胃不舒服，这样使他开始练太极拳。旁边一位老者叫杨炳沅，也述说自己的体验；去年手发木，针灸数次未愈，医生介绍他用医疗体育解决，所以跟着一位师傅学打太极拳的。……
    太阳渐渐地升高了，做早操的人们带着愉快的心情，精神饱满地走向办公室、工厂和学校。
