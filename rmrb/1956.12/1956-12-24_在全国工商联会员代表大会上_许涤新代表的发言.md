Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Xu Di Xin, a representative of state-owned enterprises attending the Second Member Representative Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, expressed his views on the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie at the meeting today.

Xu Di Xin said: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed that the fixed interest rate for private personnel in joint state-private enterprises should be set for a period of seven years. If the industrialists and businessmen still have difficulties in their lives after seven years, a "tail" can be dragged. The purpose of handling the fixed interest rate issue in this way is to enable industrialists and businessmen to work with peace of mind, study with peace of mind, accept transformation with peace of mind, and give full play to their positive roles. We hope that industrialists and businessmen across the country will clearly grasp this purpose in the fixed interest rate issue. If the fixed interest rate issue is separated from self-transformation, and it is thought that the fixed interest rate is so long that one can "rest" a bit in self-transformation, that is not right. It is recommended that industry and commerce federations at all levels conduct extensive education on this issue.

Xu Di Xin said: With such a stipulation of the fixed interest rate period, industrialists and businessmen with more capital will naturally receive more annual interest, and their lives will be reliably guaranteed; for small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, although the fixed interest rate amount is not large, it is still a small supplement to their lives. He said: There are many small industrialists and businessmen, and many people receive very little monthly fixed interest. Of course, such a stipulation of fixed interest rate cannot solve all their problems. They hope to join the trade union and enjoy labor insurance. Judging from the objective situation, most people can be accepted into the trade union. However, small and medium-sized joint ventures generally have not yet implemented labor insurance regulations, and it is impossible to implement them next year either. Then, can it be said that the government does not care enough about small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen? I don't think we can see it that way. In the past period, the government took some measures to solve the difficulties of small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses. The main ones are:

(1) According to the principle of voluntariness, small vendors were gradually, in stages, and by industry, arranged for business, organized into cooperative groups with decentralized operations and responsible for their own profits and losses, and the state-owned or cooperative wholesale stores solved the problems of supply of goods, loans and taxation for them. After implementing this method, in most areas, the business situation of small vendors has greatly improved, and the scope of difficulties has been greatly reduced.

(2) Regarding the method of subsidizing private personnel for difficulties caused by medical treatment for illness: After the enterprise verifies its assets, private personnel whose individual shares are less than 2,000 yuan will have their medical treatment and wage payment during sick leave handled in accordance with the treatment of employees in the enterprise; after the enterprise verifies its assets, even if the individual shares exceed 2,000 yuan, as long as there are indeed difficulties, regardless of the amount of shares, they can also be handled with reference to the treatment of employees in the enterprise.

(3) The production, supply, and sales plans of handicraft production cooperatives are all included in the local industrial plan. The products they produce, if they are produced and sold locally, can be sold by themselves; the raw materials required, according to the scope of commodity division of the free market, can be purchased by themselves with the approval of the local government. At the same time, take necessary measures to ensure that the income of handicraft cooperative members is not lower than before cooperation.

The above-mentioned measures still have some shortcomings in implementation, and some places have not been well implemented. This requires us to supervise, but in general, they are good. The Industry and Commerce Federation Congress proposed a draft plan for a life mutual aid fund, and we believe that establishing a life mutual aid fund in the industrial and commercial sector is a good thing. As far as I know, the government has expressed its support and sponsorship for this matter.

The implementation of these measures and methods will gradually reduce the difficulties of small industrialists and businessmen, but it cannot solve all the problems of small industrialists and businessmen at once. At present, the living standards of all classes in our country, including the vast number of workers, peasants, small industrialists and businessmen, and small vendors, are still not high, and there are still difficulties. This difficulty requires everyone to work together to overcome. The most fundamental way to overcome difficulties is to develop the national economy and promote production and circulation. We must not only see the bright prospects in the face of difficulties, but also grasp the correct direction in the face of difficulties, and strive to overcome difficulties and realize our bright prospects. We hope that large, medium and small industrialists and businessmen will work harder in the country's socialist construction and in self-transformation. For some people, I hope they will not relax their work and study, and relax their self-transformation because of the seven-year fixed interest rate; for some people, I hope they will not feel discouraged because some problems have not been solved at present. Our future is bright! Difficulties can be overcome step by step! This requires our joint efforts.

In order to help the industrial and commercial circles further carry out self-transformation, Xu Di Xin made a detailed analysis of the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie.

He said: In different historical stages, because the historical conditions are not completely the same, the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie is also not completely the same. In the stage of the new democratic revolution, the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie is willingness to participate in the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and often showing a kind of wavering and compromise in the struggle. After the victory of the democratic revolution, the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie has new content with the development of the revolutionary situation. Its positive side is mainly manifested in supporting the Common Program and the Constitution, accepting socialist transformation, and its negative side is mainly manifested in a certain degree of weakness and wavering in the struggle against the enemy, as well as a strong desire to develop capitalism. In the process of socialist transformation, it also showed to varying degrees the duality of accepting transformation and resisting transformation. After the full implementation of joint state-private ownership and the implementation of fixed interest rates, the dual nature of the national bourgeoisie is based on whether to further accept transformation, whether to overcome its capitalist ideology, and whether to contribute its talents to socialist construction.

Xu Di Xin said: After the full implementation of joint state-private ownership, the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen is specifically manifested in:

(1) Most people work actively and contribute their technology and experience to the country. They participate in socialist competitions, and many of them have won awards and honorary titles. (2) Within the enterprise, many people take an active and positive attitude to improve the relationship between public and private parties. Some of them are beginning to pay attention to improving their relationship with employees. This is beneficial to eliminating the past estrangement between labor and capital. (3) Many private personnel actively demand to learn skills, and those who already understand technology and have business experience also actively improve their level. This situation is extremely beneficial to the development of production and circulation. (4) Many people are more active in social activities. They actively encourage others to further accept transformation. (5) The theoretical study of the industrial and commercial circles has also been improved. The industrial and commercial political schools or training classes in various places have achieved remarkable achievements in the transformation of the ideology and work style of the industrial and commercial circles.

After the full implementation of joint state-private ownership and the implementation of fixed interest rates, the negativity of the industrial and commercial circles is specifically manifested in: (1) Some people cannot consciously perform their duties and responsibilities, but hold a perfunctory attitude and only seek to avoid mistakes. (2) Some people do not care about the accumulation of the country and enterprises, and individual cases even embezzle public funds and misappropriate raw materials, etc. (3) In the relationship between public and private parties, some people do not actively support the public party, but look on coldly. Individual people even use some weaknesses of the public party in their work to provoke the relationship between employees and the public party. (4) In the production and operation of enterprises, the performance of emphasizing quantity over quality and departmentalism is also quite serious. The negative effects of the industrial and commercial circles are essentially the specific manifestations of the capitalist ideology of unearned income, profit-seeking, and harming others for self-interest under new conditions. The existence of this negativity will limit the exertion of its positivity and will affect the country's socialist construction.

Since liberation, especially since the Five-Anti Movement, the positive role of the national bourgeoisie has been continuously increasing, while its negative role has been gradually restricted.

From an overall perspective, in the dual nature of the bourgeoisie, positivity is its main aspect. Under the leadership of the Party and the state, under the solidarity and education of the working class, and under the further efforts of the industrial and commercial circles themselves, positivity will continue to increase. However, we cannot therefore ignore its negativity. Pointing out its positivity is to encourage industrialists and businessmen to continue to work hard and continue to make progress; pointing out its negativity is to make industrialists and businessmen aware of their weaknesses, so that they can grasp the direction of self-transformation, attach importance to the importance of self-transformation, and strengthen their learning. If industrialists and businessmen better overcome their negativity, they will be able to better serve the country's socialist construction.

Finally, Xu Di Xin talked about the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. He said: After the full implementation of joint state-private ownership, the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce should not only not be weakened, but should continue to lead industrialists and businessmen to carry out personal transformation, mobilize all positive factors in the industrial and commercial circles to serve socialism, and assist the country in continuing to complete socialist transformation. That is to: on the one hand, continue to represent the legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen, reflect their opinions and demands, and supervise the work of the Party and the government; on the other hand, organize and promote industrialists and businessmen to carry out self-transformation and participate in socialist competitions. Even if the bourgeoisie as a class is eliminated in the future, and bourgeois elements change from exploiters to laborers, the transformation of ideology and consciousness is still a long-term task. The Federation of Industry and Commerce still needs to continue to represent the interests of this part of laborers, carry out solidarity and education activities among them, and become the organization of this part of laborers. It can be seen that in a considerable period of time in the future, the Federation of Industry and Commerce still needs to exist and continue to play its irreplaceable positive role.

Some people have raised questions about whether small and medium-sized capitalists can still be members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce after they have removed their "hats", and whether they can continue to participate in the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. My view is: even if they have removed their "hats", even if they have joined the trade union, they can still continue to participate in the Federation of Industry and Commerce as members, and continue to participate in the work of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. Their political representation can remain the same. Doing so is conducive to continuing to give play to the positive role of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and this part of industrialists and businessmen.

### 在全国工商联会员代表大会上  许涤新代表的发言

    在全国工商联会员代表大会上
    许涤新代表的发言
    新华社23日讯　参加全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会的国营企业代表许涤新今天在会上就民族资产阶级的两面性等问题发表了意见。
    许涤新说：中共中央提出对公私合营企业私方人员的定息，期间定为七年，如果七年后，工商业者生活还有困难，还可拖一个尾巴。对定息问题的这样处理，其目的是为了使工商业者能够安心工作，安心学习，安心接受改造，充分发挥其积极作用。我们希望全国工商业者，对于定息问题，要明确地掌握这个目的性。如果把定息问题同自我改造割开来看待，认为定息时间这么长，自己对于自我改造，可以
  “休息”一下，那是不对的。建议各级工商联对于这个问题，要进行广泛的教育。
    许涤新说：定息时间的这样规定，资金较多的工商业者每年取得的息额自然多些，他们的生活，将会得到可靠的保障；对于中小型工商业者，定息息额虽不大，但对他们的生活，也是不无小补的。他说：小型工商业者的人数很多，不少人的定息每月分得很少，定息的这样规定，当然不能解决他们的全部问题。他们希望加入工会、享受劳保。根据客观的情况来看，大多数人是能够被接纳入工会的，但是，中小型合营企业现在一般还没有实行劳保条例，明年也不可能实行。那么能不能说，政府对于中小型工商业不够关怀呢？我认为是不能这样看的。在过去一个时期中，政府为了解决中小工商业的困难，采取了一些措施，主要的有：
      （一）根据自愿原则，逐步地、分期地、分行分业把小商小贩进行业务安排，把他们组成分散经营、各负盈亏的合作小组，由国营或合作社的批发店为他们解决货源、贷款和纳税的问题。实行这种办法以后，在大部分地区，小商小贩的业务情况大部好转，困难面已经大为缩小了。
      （二）关于私方人员由于疾病医疗而引起的困难的补助办法：企业核定资财以后，个人股金在两千元以下的私方人员，本人的疾病治疗和病假期内的工资支付办法，都按照所在企业职工待遇办理；企业核定资财以后，个人股金虽然超过了两千元，只要确有困难，不论他的股金有多少，也可以参照所在企业职工的待遇办理。
      （三）把手工业生产合作社的产、供、销计划都纳入当地工业计划之内，其生产的产品，如系当地产当地销的，可以自销；所需原料，根据自由市场的商品划分范围，经当地政府批准，可以自购。同时，采取必要措施，使手工业合作社社员收入不较合作化以前降低。
    上述这些措施，在执行中，还存在一些缺点，有些地方还未能很好贯彻下去，这就需要我们来进行督促，但是，总的说那是好的。这次工商联代表大会提出了生活互助金办法草案，我们认为在工商界中设立生活互助金是一件好事。据我所知，政府方面，对于这一件事，已经表示了支持和赞助。
    这些措施和办法的实行，将逐步地减少小工商业者的困难，但不能一下子把小型工商业者的问题全部加以解决。现在我国各阶级，包括广大的工人、农民、小工商业者和小商小贩等，生活水平仍然不高，并且还有困难。这个困难，需要大家通力合作来克服。克服困难的最根本的办法，就是发展国民经济，搞起生产和流通。我们不但要在困难中看出光明的远景，而且要在困难中，掌握住正确的方向，努力去克服困难，实现我们的光明远景。我们希望大中小型工商业者，都要在国家的社会主义建设中，在自我改造中，加倍努力。对于某些人，希望他们不要因为定息七年而放松工作和学习，放松自我改造；对于某些人，希望他们不要因为眼前某些问题未能解决，而感到灰心丧气。我们的前途，是光明的！困难是可以逐步克服的！这就需要我们大家共同努力。
    为了帮助工商界进一步进行自我改造，许涤新对于民族资产阶级的两面性问题，作了详尽的分析。
    他说：在各个历史阶段上，因为历史条件不全相同，民族资产阶级所表现出来的两面性，也就不全相同。在新民主主义革命阶段中，民族资产阶级的两面性是愿意参加反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本的斗争，和在斗争中常常表现一种动摇性和妥协性。在民主革命胜利以后，民族资产阶级的两面性，随着革命形势的发展有了新的内容，它的积极一面，主要表现为拥护共同纲领和宪法、接受社会主义改造，消极一面，主要表现为对敌斗争中的一定程度的软弱和动摇，同时还有发展资本主义的强烈愿望。在社会主义改造的过程中，也在不同程度上表现出接受改造和抵抗改造的两面性。在全面公私合营和实行定息以后，民族资产阶级的两面性则以是否进一步接受改造，是否克服其资本主义的思想意识，是否贡献其才能为社会主义建设服务，作为标准。
    许涤新说：全行业实行公私合营以后，工商业者的积极性具体来说，主要表现为：
    （一）多数人积极工作，把自己的技术和经验，贡献给国家。他们参加社会主义竞赛，在其中，有不少人获得奖励和荣誉称号。（二）在企业内部，有不少人，以主动和积极的态度，来改善公私共事关系，其中有一些人，开始注意改善其对于职工的关系。他们这样做，对于消除劳资间过去遗留下的隔阂，是有利的。（三）不少私方人员积极要求学习本事，原来已经懂得技术和有业务经验的，也积极在提高其水平。这种情况，对于发展生产和流通是极有利的。（四）不少人对于社会活动，更加积极。他们积极地推动别人，来进一步接受改造。（五）工商界的理论学习，也有所提高，各地的工商政治学校或讲习班，对工商界思想意识和作风的改造获得了显著的成就。
    在全行业公私合营和实行定息以后，工商界的消极性具体来说主要表现为：（一）有一些人对自己职务不能自觉地守职尽责，而是抱着得过且过，但求无过的态度。（二）有些人不关心国家和企业的积累，个别的甚至挪用公款、盗用原材料等等。（三）在公私关系上，有一些人没有积极支持公方，而是冷眼旁观，个别的人甚至利用公方在工作中的某些弱点，挑拨职工和公方的关系。（四）在企业的生产经营上，重量不重质和本位主义的表现，也是相当严重的。工商界的这些消极作用，在本质上就是资产阶级的不劳而获、唯利是图、损人利己等思想意识在新的条件下的具体表现。这种消极性的存在，将会限制着他的积极性的发挥，将会影响着国家的社会主义建设。
    解放以来，特别是在五反运动以来，民族资产阶级的积极作用不断地在增长着，而他的消极作用则逐步地受到了限制。
    从全面来看，在资产阶级的两面性中，积极性是他的主要的一面。在党和国家的领导之下，在工人阶级的团结教育之下，在工商界本身的进一步努力的条件下，积极性将还继续在增长。但是，我们不能因此就忽视他的消极性。指出他的积极性，是为了鼓励工商业者继续努力，继续进步；指出他的消极性，是为了使工商业者知道自己的弱点，从而，能够抓住自我改造努力的方向，能够重视自我改造的重要性，能够加强学习。工商业者如果更好地克服自己的消极性，也就能够更好地为国家的社会主义建设服务。
    最后，许涤新谈到了工商联的工作。他说：全行业公私合营以后，工商联的工作不仅不应削弱，而且应该继续领导工商业者进行个人的改造，调动工商界的一切积极因素为社会主义服务、协助国家继续完成社会主义改造。这就是要：一方面，继续代表工商业者的合法利益，反映他们的意见和要求，对党和政府的工作进行监督；另一方面，组织和推动工商业者进行自我改造和参加社会主义竞赛。即使将来资产阶级作为阶级被消灭，资产阶级分子由剥削者变为劳动者，但思想意识形态的改造，仍是长期的，工商联仍然需要继续代表这部分劳动者的利益，在他们中间进行团结教育的活动，成为这部分劳动者的组织。由此可见，在今后一个相当长的时期内，工商联仍然需要存在，仍然需要继续发挥它的不可代替的积极作用。
    有些人提出中小资本家摘了帽子以后是否仍可作为工商联的会员、可否继续参加工商联工作等问题。我的看法：他们即使摘了帽子，即使加入了工会，但仍然可以继续参加工商联为会员，并继续参加工商联工作，他们的政治代表性同样可以照旧不变。这样做，有利于继续发挥工商联和这部分工商业者的积极作用。
