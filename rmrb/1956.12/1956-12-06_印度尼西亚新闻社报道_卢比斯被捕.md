Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 5th: The Indonesian News Agency reported that former Indonesian Army Deputy Chief of Staff Lubis has reportedly been arrested. An Indonesian Army spokesman declined to confirm or deny this news. He said, "I am not authorized to make any statement on this matter."

Lubis was wanted for allegedly plotting a coup attempt to overthrow the government recently.

(Editor's Note) Lubis once served as the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army. In June 1955, while acting as the Army Chief of Staff, he disobeyed government orders, refused to allow the new Army Chief of Staff to take office, and attempted to launch a coup. This plot failed, but it eventually triggered a cabinet crisis, and the Sastroamidjojo cabinet at the time had to resign. After the general election, Sastroamidjojo formed a cabinet again. On August 13th of this year, when Foreign Minister Abdulgani was preparing to attend the London Conference to discuss the Suez Canal issue, Lubis plotted to arrest the Foreign Minister and all cabinet ministers. In September and October, Lubis attempted to launch armed coups twice in a row. After these conspiracies failed, Lubis went into hiding. The Indonesian government announced an order for Lubis' arrest on November 21st and recently revoked Lubis' military rank.

　　卢比斯被捕
    新华社雅加达5日电　印度尼西亚新闻社报道，据悉印度尼西亚前陆军副参谋长卢比斯已经被逮捕。印度尼西亚陆军发言人拒绝证实或否认这个消息。他说，“我还没有受权就这件事发表任何声明”。
    卢比斯由于最近策划政变企图推翻政府而被通缉。
      （编者附注）　卢比斯曾任印度尼西亚陆军副参谋长。1955年6月，他在代理陆军参谋长职务期间，违抗政府命令，拒绝新陆军参谋长就职，并且企图发动政变。这个阴谋未能得逞，但终于引起了内阁危机，当时的沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁不得不辞职。大选后，沙斯特罗阿米佐约再度组阁。今年8月13日，外交部长阿卜杜加尼正准备参加讨论苏伊士运河问题的伦敦会议时，卢比斯策划企图逮捕外长和全部内阁部长的阴谋。9月间和10月间，卢比斯又连续两次企图发动武装政变。这些阴谋失败之后，卢比斯潜藏起来了。印度尼西亚政府在11月21日宣布了通缉卢比斯的命令，最近撤消了卢比斯的军衔。
