Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, 5th -- The CPC Fushun Municipal Committee held a safety work conference on the 3rd to review the safety production work of factories and mines and put forward suggestions for improvement.

Accidents in the state-owned factories and mines in Fushun City this year are more serious than in previous years. In eleven state-owned factories and mines in the city, more than 2,000 casualty accidents occurred from January to November, resulting in more than 50,000 lost workdays due to work-related injuries. Equipment accidents are also frequent. In the coal mine system alone, equipment accident repair costs amounted to more than 160,000 yuan in the first eight months, and equipment accidents affected the production of more than 60,000 tons of raw coal.

The conference examined the main reasons for the high number of accidents: Party committees at all levels did not provide sufficient leadership and supervision over safety production during the advanced producer movement; many factories and mines relaxed routine safety education, safety management was weak, and violations of safety regulations and rules increased. More than half of the casualties in Fushun Coal Mine were caused by a lack of safety education. In the metalworking workshop of Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant, 30% of the safety devices on lathes were removed by workers, resulting in several serious injuries where fingers were bitten off by gears.

The conference pointed out that the key to doing a good job in safety work in the future is to implement the mass line, combining professional safety, technical supervision, and mass safety inspections. The formulation of all safety measures and plans must widely solicit opinions from the masses, and the masses must be mobilized to conduct inspections regularly. At the same time, the causes of accidents and preventive measures must be thoroughly explained to the masses to prevent the recurrence of accidents.

　　中共抚顺市委召开安全工作会议
　　批评过去安全工作中的缺点并提出改进意见
    新华社抚顺5日电　中共抚顺市委在3日召开安全工作会议，检查厂矿企业安全生产工作，提出了改进意见。
    抚顺市国营厂矿生产中的事故今年比前几年严重。全市十一个国营厂矿，从1月份到11月份发生伤亡事故两千多次，因工伤旷工达五万多个工作日。设备事故也很频繁，仅煤矿系统在前八个月里付出的设备事故修理费就有十六万多元，因为设备事故的影响少生产了原煤六万多吨。
    会议检查事故多的主要原因，是各级党委在先进生产者运动中对安全生产的领导和监督不够；许多厂矿放松了经常性的安全教育工作，安全管理薄弱，违犯保安规程制度的现象增多。抚顺煤矿一半以上的伤亡事故是因为缺乏安全教育所造成的。抚顺重型机器厂金工车间车床上的安全装置，30％都被工人拆掉了，因此，曾经几次发生牙轮咬断手指的重伤事故。
    会议指出，今后做好安全工作的关键是贯彻群众路线，把业务保安、技术监督和群众性的安全检查结合起来。一切安全措施计划的制定都要广泛征求群众意见，经常发动群众进行检查，同时把事故发生的原因和防止的办法深入的向群众交代，以杜绝事故重复发生。
