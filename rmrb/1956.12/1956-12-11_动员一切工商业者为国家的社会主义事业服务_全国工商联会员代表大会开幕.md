Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: The Second Member Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce opened in Beijing today.

After Li Zhuchen, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, announced the opening, the conference unanimously approved Chen Shutong and 122 others as members of the presidium, and Sha Qianli as the secretary-general of the conference. Then, Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, delivered a report entitled "All Industrialists and Businessmen, Continue to Accept Socialist Transformation, Give Full Play to Positive Roles, and Strive for the Great Socialist Construction of Our Country!" This report provided detailed explanations on the decisive victory of socialist transformation, the main tasks of industrialists and businessmen at present, the direction of their efforts, and the tasks of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. (The full text of the report is on pages two and three)

Following Chen Shutong's report, Burhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth league, delivered speeches in succession. They all extended warm congratulations to the conference.

Burhan said that the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has been basically completed, and many new tasks have emerged. In this new situation, the convocation of the Second Member Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce has even more important significance. He said that all industrialists and businessmen will certainly continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, manage cooperative affairs well in all joint public-private enterprises, participate in socialist emulation, and improve productivity, contributing more and better products to the country and the people. This is the greatest expectation of the people of the whole country for the industrial and commercial circles.

In his speech, Huang Yanpei explained the great victory that has been achieved in the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. At the same time, he said that our task has not yet been completed. The capitalist ownership of the means of production has not yet been finally eliminated, and to transform capitalists into laborers in name and in fact, we must continue to work hard. He said that the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly shoulder the glorious task of uniting and educating national industrialists and businessmen and helping them accept socialist transformation. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to further promote democracy, strengthen collective leadership, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and mobilize all positive factors in our units.

Lai Ruoyu said in his speech that after the capitalists participated in the work of joint ventures as staff members, most of them showed a high degree of enthusiasm in study and work, and tried their best to contribute their knowledge and expertise to serve socialist construction. The vast number of private personnel in enterprises also participated in socialist emulation and the advanced producer movement together with the workers; they participated in various social activities and some meetings of the trade union together with the workers. With the mutual help of workers and private personnel, many private personnel have improved politically and ideologically, and many workers have also made progress in culture and technology. This mutual help is conducive to the further development of joint public-private enterprises.

Lai Ruoyu said that the contradiction between labor and capital still exists, but this does not hinder cooperation between the two sides in their work. He said that further improvement of the relationship between the two sides depends on the joint efforts of both sides. At present, there are still a few private personnel who are not performing well. We hope to overcome these negative factors together. The trade union should also often educate employees to respect the authority of private personnel in their work and help private personnel do their work well.

Lai Ruoyu also said that the vast majority of capitalists are progressive or tend to be progressive. The working class welcomes the progressive performance of the bourgeoisie very much and is willing to mobilize the workers to assist them on their way forward.

He finally said that when the capitalists give up exploitation and become self-reliant laborers, if they are willing, the employees will certainly accept them into the trade union organization. Under the long-term existence of the fixed interest system, many private personnel will not be trade union members for a considerable period of time in the future, but this does not hinder the relationship between the two sides. He said that in the future, the trade union will absorb more private personnel to participate in the competition, and support the correct suggestions of private personnel in their work as they support workers. All kinds of social activities of the trade union can absorb private personnel and their families to participate, and some meetings of the trade union can also invite private personnel to attend as non-voting delegates, so as to make the relationship between private personnel and the trade union closer and closer.

In his speech, Liao Chengzhi hoped that young people in industrial and commercial circles should not only give play to their existing abilities and roles, but also become active members in socialist construction, and train themselves to become socialist scientists, engineers, and various specialists who serve the working people. He said that the young people in the industrial and commercial circles are an active shock force in the industrial and commercial circles, and should take the lead in breaking down old ideas and old styles, and take the lead in establishing a new style of diligently engaging in ordinary practical labor, considering everything from the interests of the country, not fearing difficulties, and being full of vigor.

In the afternoon, Bo Yibo, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Economic Commission, delivered a report to the conference (see tomorrow's issue of this newspaper).

A total of 1,233 representatives and observers attended today's conference.

    动员一切工商业者为国家的社会主义事业服务
    全国工商联会员代表大会开幕
    新华社10日讯　中华全国工商业联合会第二届会员代表大会今天在北京开幕。
    中华全国工商业联合会副主任委员李烛尘宣布开幕后，大会一致通过陈叔通等一百二十三人为大会主席团，沙千里为大会秘书长。接着，中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通以“全国工商业者，继续接受社会主义改造，充分发挥积极作用，为我国伟大的社会主义建设而奋斗！”为题作了报告。这个报告，对社会主义改造的决定性胜利、全国工商业者当前的主要任务、全国工商业者努力的方向、工商业联合会的任务等问题作了详细的说明。（报告全文见第二、三版）
    在陈叔通报告以后，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席包尔汉、中国民主建国会中央委员会主任委员黄炎培，中华全国总工会主席赖若愚，中华全国民主青年联合会主席、青年团中央书记处书记廖承志，先后致词。他们都向大会致以热烈祝贺。
    鲍尔汉说，目前资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经基本完成，出现了许多新的工作，在这新的情况下，全国工商联召开第二届会员代表大会有更重要的意义。他说，全国工商业者一定会在中国共产党和人民政府领导下继续发扬爱国主义精神，在所有的公私合营企业中搞好合作共事关系，参加社会主义竞赛，提高生产力，为国家为人民贡献更多更好的产品，这正是全国人民对工商界的最大期望。
    黄炎培在致词中说明了资本主义工商业的改造已经取得的伟大胜利。同时他说，我们的任务还没有完成，资本主义的生产资料所有制还没有最后消灭，要使资本家改造成为名副其实的劳动者，也还须好好地继续努力。他说，中国民主建国会和中华全国工商业联合会共同担负着团结、教育民族工商业者，帮助他们接受社会主义改造的光荣任务，要完成这样的任务，必须进一步发扬民主，加强集体领导，开展批评和自我批评，调动本单位的一切积极因素。
    赖若愚在致词中说，在资本家以工作人员身份参加合营企业工作之后，绝大部分人在学习上和工作上都表现了高度的积极性，尽力贡献自己的知识和专长，为社会主义建设服务。企业中广大的私方人员，还同工人群众一道参加了社会主义竞赛，参加了先进生产者运动；同工人一道参加了工会的各种社会活动和某些会议。在工人和私方人员相互帮助下，许多私方人员在政治上、思想上有了提高，许多工人在文化和技术上也有了进步。这种相互帮助是有利于公私合营企业进一步发展的。
    赖若愚说，劳资之间的矛盾仍然是存在的，但是这并不妨碍双方在工作中的合作。他说，双方关系的进一步改进，有赖于双方的共同努力。目前还有少数私方人员表现不好，对于这种消极因素，希望我们共同来克服。工会也要经常教育职工尊重私方人员在工作中的职权，帮助私方人员做好工作。
    赖若愚还说，绝大部分资本家是进步的或趋向进步的，工人阶级非常欢迎资产阶级的进步表现，并愿意发动工人群众在他们前进的道路上给予协助。
    他最后说，在资本家放弃了剥削成为自食其力的劳动者的时候，如果他们愿意，职工群众一定会接受他们到工会组织中来。在定息制度长期存在的情况下，以后相当长一段时期内，许多资方人员还不会是工会会员，但是这并不妨碍双方的共事关系。他说，今后工会将更多地吸收私方人员参加竞赛，对私方人员工作上的正确建议像对待工人一样给予支持。工会的各种社会活动，都可以吸收私方人员及其家属参加，工会的某些会议也可以邀请私方人员列席，以便使私方人员和工会的关系日益密切起来。
    廖承志在致词中希望工商界青年不但要发挥现有的能力和作用，而且要成为社会主义建设中的积极分子，锻炼成为为劳动人民服务的社会主义的科学家、工程师和各种专门家。他说，工商界的青年是工商界中的积极的突击力量，应该带头破除旧思想，旧作风，带头树立起勤勤恳恳从事实际的平凡劳动，对人对事一切都从国家利益出发，不怕困难，朝气勃勃的新作风。
    下午，国务院副总理兼国家经济委员会主任薄一波向大会作了报告（见明天本报）。
    出席今天大会的代表和列席人员共一千二百三十三人。
