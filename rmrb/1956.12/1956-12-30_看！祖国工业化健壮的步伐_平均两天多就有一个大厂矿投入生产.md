Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch: This year, China's industrial construction has achieved tremendous success, with an average of more than two days for a large factory or mine to go into production. This year's investment in industrial construction is equivalent to more than half of the value of fixed assets of new-style industries built in the old China over seventy years since 1949.

　　There are more than 620 large-scale factory and mine projects under construction this year, which is more than 140 projects than stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for construction this year. Among the projects under construction this year, 120 are projects belonging to the 156 projects assisted by the Soviet Union in China's construction.

　　According to preliminary statistics, more than 140 large-scale factories and mines above the quota have been put into production in whole or in part this year, of which 24 projects belong to the 156 projects assisted by the Soviet Union in China's construction. Including the previous three years, China has had more than 200 large-scale factories and mines above the quota put into full production. These large enterprises put into production will vigorously promote the development of China's national economy and enhance China's national defense capabilities. The projects that have been put into production in whole or in part this year include two blast furnaces, eight open-hearth furnaces, an automobile factory, more than 20 machinery manufacturing factories, more than 20 power plants, more than 20 pairs of coal mine shafts, as well as cement plants, electron tube factories, and oil factories, as well as paper mills, textile mills, and sugar mills. The designed capacity of the enterprises put into production this year has not yet been counted. Only the designed capacity of the enterprises put into production by the central industrial departments this year can produce more than 700,000 tons of pig iron, more than 1.3 million tons of steel, 90,000 tons of steel, more than 200,000 tons of petroleum, more than 600,000 tons of cement, more than 600,000 kilowatts of electricity, more than 8 million tons of coal, 30,000 vehicles, more than 100 million meters of cotton cloth, more than 20,000 tons of sugar, more than 40,000 tons of paper, and rubber and chemical products annually.

　　This is the greatest welfare that the hard work of millions of builders has brought to the people of the motherland this year.

　　China's funds used for industrial construction this year totaled more than 6 billion yuan, which is equivalent to more than half of the value of fixed assets of new-style industries built in the old China from the 1870s to 1948, a total of more than 70 years. Including the previous three years, China's funds used for industrial construction have exceeded the value of the country's industrial fixed assets in 1952. In terms of the speed of industrial construction, this year increased by 60% compared with last year, which is the fastest growth rate in history.

　　However, due to the excessively large investment in national capital construction and the decentralized use of certain funds, there has been a shortage of materials, especially steel and wood, which has brought some difficulties to industrial construction. Now, in the preparation of the 1957 basic construction plan, various departments are correcting the deviations that occurred this year.

    看！祖国工业化健壮的步伐
    平均两天多就有一个大厂矿投入生产
    新华社29日讯　今年我国工业建设成就巨大，平均每两天多就有一个大厂矿投入生产。今年工业建设的投资，等于我国1949年接收的旧中国七十多年建设的新式工业固定资产价值的一半以上。
    今年施工的限额以上的大厂矿工程，共六百二十多项，比五年计划规定本年施工的项目多了一百四十多个。今年施工的工程中，有一百二十项是属于苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项工程项目。
    据初步统计，今年全国已经全部或部分投入生产的限额以上的大厂矿有一百四十多个，其中有二十四个项目属于苏联帮助我国建设的一百五十六项中的工程。连前三年在内，我国已经有了二百多个限额以上大厂矿全部投入生产。这些投入生产的大企业，将有力地促进我国国民经济的发展和增强我国的国防力量。今年全部或部分投入生产的工程有两个高炉、八个平炉、一个汽车厂和二十多个机械制造厂、二十多个发电厂、二十多对煤矿矿井，还有水泥厂、电子管厂和石油厂，以及造纸厂、纺织厂和制糖厂等。今年全国投入生产的企业设计能力目前还没有统计，仅是中央各工业部今年投入生产的企业的设计能力，一年就可以生产七十多万吨生铁，一百三十多万吨钢，九万吨钢材，二十多万吨石油，六十多万吨水泥，六十多万瓩电，八百多万吨煤，三万辆汽车，一亿多公尺棉布，二万多吨糖，四万多吨纸及橡胶和化学等产品。
    这就是千百万建设者一年来辛勤劳动带给祖国人民的最大福利。
    我国今年用于工业建设的资金共六十多亿元，等于我国1949年接收的旧中国从十九世纪七十年代起到1948年共七十多年建设的新式工业固定资产价值的一半以上。连前三年在内，我国用于工业建设的资金，已超过1952年全国工业固定资产的价值。在工业建设的速度方面，今年比去年增长60％，是历年来增长速度最快的一年。
    但是，由于全国基本建设投资偏大，某些资金使用分散，造成了物资特别是钢材、木材等供应紧张的情况，给工业建设带来了一些困难。现在，各部门在编制1957年的基本建设计划中，正在纠正今年发生的偏向。
