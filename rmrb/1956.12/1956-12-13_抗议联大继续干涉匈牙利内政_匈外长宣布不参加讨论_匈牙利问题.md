Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 12th: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on December 11th to continue discussing "The Hungarian Question."

	At the beginning of the meeting, Hungarian Foreign Minister Horvath read a statement protesting the meeting's continued interference in Hungary's internal affairs, despite Hungary's opposition. The statement said: The purpose of the Hungarian government in sending a Hungarian delegation to this General Assembly is to discuss major international issues jointly with other countries in the capacity of a full member of the United Nations. However, the US delegation and the delegations of many countries under American influence have attempted to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs in their speeches and in certain proposals. Many delegations have also insulted the government of the Hungarian People's Republic and its delegation to the United Nations in a rude and humiliating manner, and the Hungarian question has been continuously placed on the agenda, which is contrary to Hungarian sovereignty and the national dignity of the Hungarian people. For this reason, as long as the discussion on the Hungarian question is not conducted in the spirit of the United Nations Charter, the Hungarian delegation will not participate in the work of the 11th session of the General Assembly.
	After issuing the statement, the Hungarian delegation immediately withdrew from the meeting.
	Bulgarian representative Voutov then spoke. He pointed out that some people are currently using "The Hungarian Question" to obstruct the normal work of the meeting and divert the attention of the General Assembly from the major international issues that the people of the world eagerly hope to be resolved. He said that the 11th session of the General Assembly has been open for a month, but it has not yet begun to discuss the main issues on the agenda, such as disarmament and the opposition to colonialism.
	Voutov expressed opposition to sending "observers" to Hungary and Hungary's neighboring countries, pointing out that this is interference in the internal affairs of these countries. Voutov also pointed out that the proposal put forward by the United States and some other countries on the 10th regarding "The Hungarian Question" seriously violates the United Nations Charter and is directed against the Hungarian people and the countries of the socialist camp.
	Albanian representative Shtulla requested the General Assembly to stop the clamor over "The Hungarian Question" and begin discussing the important issues included on the agenda of the General Assembly.
	Austrian representative Matschi put forward a new proposal at the meeting, which suggested authorizing UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld to "do everything in his power and use all his means to seek a constructive solution to the Hungarian question on the basis of the principles of the United Nations Charter." According to this proposal, the Secretary-General would have the right to negotiate with the relevant member states on "The Hungarian Question" and report the results of the negotiations to the General Assembly.
	Yugoslav representative Ivkovic said that he would be very interested in studying the Austrian proposal. As for the proposals of the United States and 19 other countries, and the proposals of India and other countries, the Yugoslav delegation would abstain from voting because it did not believe that these two proposals could improve the situation in Hungary.
	The representatives of Libya and Tunisia expressed disagreement with the part of the twenty-nation proposal that required "condemning" the Soviet Union. However, they stated that they would vote in favor of the proposal.
	The General Assembly decided to continue discussing "The Hungarian Question" on December 13.

    抗议联大继续干涉匈牙利内政
    匈外长宣布不参加讨论“匈牙利问题”
    据新华社12日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会12月11日举行全体会议，继续讨论“匈牙利问题”。
    在会议开始的时候，匈牙利外交部长霍瓦特宣读了一项声明，抗议会议不顾匈牙利的反对，继续干涉匈牙利内政。声明说：匈牙利政府派匈牙利代表团出席本届大会的目的是：以联合国全权会员国的身份同其他国家共同讨论国际上的主要问题。可是，美国代表团和处在美国影响下的许多国家的代表团在发言以及在某些提案中，都企图干涉匈牙利内政。许多代表团还用粗暴的方式和凌辱的方式侮辱匈牙利人民共和国政府和它在联合国的代表团，而匈牙利问题也连续不断地列在议程上，这是同匈牙利主权和匈牙利人民的民族尊严相抵触的。为此，只要关于匈牙利问题的讨论不根据联合国宪章的精神进行，匈牙利代表团就不参加大会十一届会议的工作。
    匈牙利代表团在发表声明后，立即退出了会场。
    保加利亚代表伏托夫接着发言。他指出，目前有人利用“匈牙利问题”来阻挠会议的正常工作，并且转移大会对全世界人民殷切期望得到解决的主要国际问题的注意。他说，第十一届联大开幕已经有一个月了，但是还没有开始讨论议程中的主要问题，例如裁军问题和反对殖民主义的问题。
    伏托夫表示反对派“观察员”到匈牙利和匈牙利的邻国去，指出这是对这些国家内政的干涉。伏托夫并且指出，美国和其他一些国家在10日就“匈牙利问题”提出的提案，严重地违反联合国宪章，它的矛头是针对着匈牙利人民和社会主义阵营各国的。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表什图拉要求大会停止在“匈牙利问题”上的喧闹，而开始讨论列入大会议程的各项重要问题。
    奥地利代表马契在会上提出一项新提案，这个提案建议授权联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德“尽他的一切能力和使用他所有的一切手段来求得一个在联合国宪章原则的基础上解决匈牙利问题的建设性办法”。根据这个提案，秘书长将有权同有关的会员国就“匈牙利问题”进行谈判，并且把谈判的结果向大会报告。
    南斯拉夫代表伊维科维奇说，他将很感兴趣地研究奥地利的提案。至于美国等二十国的提案和印度等国的提案，南斯拉夫代表团在表决的时候将弃权，因为它并不认为这两个提案可以改善匈牙利的局势。
    利比亚和突尼斯代表表示不同意二十国提案中要求“谴责”苏联的部分。但是他们表示，他们将投票赞成这个提案。
    大会决定在12月13日继续就“匈牙利问题”进行讨论。
