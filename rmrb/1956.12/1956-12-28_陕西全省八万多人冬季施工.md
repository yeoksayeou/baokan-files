Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 26th: In Shaanxi Province, over 200 key projects across more than 30 factories and mines are currently being carried out by a construction force of over 80,000 people during the winter season. From both sides of the Longhai Railway traversing the Guanzhong Plain to the hilly areas of the Weibei Plateau, construction workers can be seen braving the cold to build new factories, coal mines, railways, and power transmission lines.

This year marks the largest winter construction scale in Shaanxi Province since the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. On the Guanzhong Plain, the most eye-catching construction sites during the winter are the electrical engineering zone and the textile zone in the suburbs of Xi'an. When the first snow fell in Xi'an, workers at the power capacitor factory construction site in the electrical engineering zone were hoisting prefabricated concrete beams for the main factory building. Another newly built high-voltage electrical porcelain factory is also currently plastering the factory buildings and constructing roofs. The huge factory buildings of the state-owned Northwest Sixth Cotton Textile Factory, the last cotton textile factory to be completed quickly in the textile zone in the eastern suburbs of Xi'an, have already been roofed, and assembly workers are installing textile machinery. At the construction site of the new printing and dyeing factory, employees are building residential areas for printing and dyeing workers.

In the Tongchuan mining area of the "Shaanxi Black Belt" – the Weibei Coalfield – efforts are also being concentrated this winter to continue building three pairs of coal shafts: the Sanlidong vertical shaft, the Wangjiahe No. 1 vertical shaft, and the Taoyuan adit project. Among them, the Sanlidong vertical shaft will be handed over to production in the first quarter of next year. A central machinery repair plant in the mining area is also under construction. At the same time, railway workers are braving the cold to build more than 30 kilometers of new railway for the Tongchuan mining area; installation workers are also erecting a high-voltage power transmission line from Xi'an in the direction of Tongchuan.

This year, winter construction projects in Shaanxi Province are not only large in scale, but also have more industrial buildings than civil buildings, and the workload of high-altitude operations is also large. Before the first snowfall in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi, all construction sites had made preparations for winter construction. The construction force participating in this year's winter construction has put forward the slogan of "Challenging the wind and snow, marching towards the cold." They want to build these key projects well and quickly during the more than three months of severe cold.

### 陕西全省八万多人冬季施工

    陕西全省八万多人冬季施工
    新华社西安26日电　陕西境内约有三十多个厂矿的二百多项重点工程，正在集中约八万多人的建设大军进行冬季施工。从横贯秦川平原的陇海铁路两旁，到渭北高原的丘陵地带，都可以看到建筑工人正在冒着严寒建设新的工厂、煤井、铁路和输电线路。
    今年是陕西省执行第一个五年计划以来冬季施工规模最大的一年。秦川平原上冬季最引人注目的施工工地，是建设中的西安郊区的电工区和纺织区。当西安第一次飘雪的时候，电工区的电力电容器厂工地上，工人们正在吊装主厂房的混凝土预制梁；另一个新建的高压电瓷厂，也正在粉饰厂房和修建屋面。设在西安东郊纺织区的最后一个快建成的棉纺织厂——国营西北第六棉纺织厂的巨大厂房，已经盖上了屋顶，装配工人正在安装纺织机器。在新建的印染厂工地上，职工们正在建设印染工人的住宅区。
    在“陕西黑腰带”——渭北煤田的铜川矿区，今年冬天也在集中力量继续兴建三对煤井——三里洞竖井、王家河一号竖井和桃园平洞工程。其中，三里洞竖井在明年第一季度就将移交生产。还有一座矿区中央机械修配厂，也在建设中。和这同时，铁路工人正在冒着严寒为铜川矿区新筑三十多公里铁路；安装工人也在把一条高压输电线路，从西安向铜川方向架设。
    今年陕西省冬季施工工程不仅规模大，而且工业建筑要比民用建筑多，高空作业的工作量也大。在陕西秦川地区第一次降雪以前，各工地就做好了冬季施工准备工作。参加今年冬季施工的建设大军，都提出“向风雪挑战，向寒冷进军”的口号。他们要在三个多月的严寒日子里，把这些重点工程建设得又好又快。
