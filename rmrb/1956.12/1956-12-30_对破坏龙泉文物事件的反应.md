    Reactions to the Destruction of Longquan Cultural Relics
    Since the publication of the article "Large Numbers of Precious Longquan Cultural Relics Destroyed" in this newspaper on December 13th, a large number of readers have written letters expressing their infinite grief over this event, severely condemning the destroyers, and offering suggestions for future measures to protect cultural relics.
    The majority of readers believe that the destruction of these cultural relics is an irreparable loss to China's cultural heritage. All the fourth-year students majoring in Archeology at the Department of History of Peking University wrote: "Our country has abundant cultural relics. These cultural relics are not only China's but also the world's precious cultural heritage. However, certain cadres in Longquan, under the pretext of 'waste utilization' and 'eliminating superstition,' destroyed a large number of cultural relics, which is intolerable." All the students in dormitory 120 of Anhui Medical College wrote: "When we read this news, even though we are facing the end-of-term exams, we cannot help but write to you to express our uncontrollable indignation."
    Many readers unanimously believe that the most important task at present is to quickly take effective measures, especially to strengthen the publicity of policies for the protection of cultural relics, popularize knowledge about cultural relics, and prevent similar events from happening. Comrade Li Yun of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Military Commission wrote: "Currently, the destruction of cultural relics is mostly due to the lack of knowledge of certain cadres. The main way to prevent this is education; but it is not a matter of treating the symptom but rather of universal education, raising awareness, and forming a social atmosphere of cherishing cultural relics. In addition to this, rewards and punishments are also indispensable." Comrade Zheng Zhonghan of the Twenty-Sixth Dormitory of Xuzhou Railway wrote: "I suggest that relevant departments promptly go deep into the masses and extensively carry out publicity work. Moreover, this work must be carried out regularly; otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve results." In addition, some readers, such as Li Chun and two other comrades, Chinese students studying at Moscow University, also pointed out that local newspapers bear a particularly important responsibility in promoting the policy of protecting cultural relics.

### 对破坏龙泉文物事件的反应

    对破坏龙泉文物事件的反应
    自12月13日本报发表了“龙泉大批珍贵文物遭到毁坏”一稿后，广大读者纷纷来信，对这个事件表示了无限的痛心，对破坏者给予了严厉谴责，并对今后保护文物措施提出了建议。
    广大读者认为，这批文物的被毁，是我国文化遗产的一个不可弥补的损失。北京大学历史系考古专门化四年级全体同学写道：“我国有丰富的文物。这些文物不仅是我国的，也是世界的珍贵文化遗产。而龙泉某些干部却在‘废物利用’、‘破除迷信’的借口下，把大量的文物摧毁，这是令人难以容忍的。”安徽医学院第一二○寝室全体同学写道：“当我们读到这条消息后，虽然我们正逢学期终结考试，但是我们不能不给你们写信，表示我们无法抑止的愤慨。”
    许多读者一致认为，目前最主要的工作，还是赶快采取有效措施，特别是加强对保护文物政策的宣传，普及文物知识，防止发生类似事件。军委总政文化部犁云同志写道：“现时对于文物的毁坏，大抵由于某些干部知识缺乏所致。防止之法，主要还是教育；但不是头痛医头，而应普遍教育，提高认识，形成爱护文物的风气。除此之外，惩奖也不可少。”徐州铁路二十六宿舍郑衷寒同志写道：“建议有关部门尽速深入群众，广泛展开宣传工作。并且，这个工作必须经常进行，否则是很难收到成效的。”此外，有的读者，如莫斯科大学中国留学生李春等三位同志还提出，各地报纸在宣传保护文物政策的工作中，更负有特别重大的责任。
