Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th. Moscow is already showing the lively scene of the eve of the festival. Everywhere crowds are bustling. Housewives are walking out of the stores with large bags of New Year's goods, and many people taking various means of transportation are carrying fir trees and bouquets. In the past few days, the largest state-owned Central Department Store in the country has received 300,000 customers every day, and many people have also used the telephone to purchase goods.

　　In the past year, Moscow has undergone new changes, becoming more beautiful, magnificent, and spacious. More than seventy new squares and streets have appeared in the city this year. The city has built 1.36 million square meters of housing in a year, which is 500,000 square meters more than last year. It is estimated that a total of 300,000 residents will move into new homes throughout the year. Four new residential areas have been built near the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition and in the southwestern suburbs. Rows of brand-new and beautiful buildings of about seven stories form new streets in these areas. According to the capital's reconstruction plan, the builders also built many houses for schools, clubs, cinemas, and nurseries this year.

　　When welcoming the New Year, the workers and intellectuals of the Soviet capital cannot help but proudly recall the achievements made in 1956. In the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Moscow's workers and scientists made contributions to the further development of science and technology. The world's largest synchronous phase-stable accelerator was established here, and the world-renowned "Tu-104" jet airliner flew from here to the capitals of many countries. Many modern new machines and equipment were transported from here to all parts of the country. The people of Moscow are working hard for the cause of communism.

　　Moscow Radio and the Post and Telecommunications Bureau are broadcasting and transmitting millions of New Year's telegrams. The main ideas they express to each other are:

　　Congratulations on achieving new labor victories for the honor of the motherland!

    新年前夕的莫斯科
    新华社莫斯科30日电　莫斯科已经呈现出节日前夕的热闹景象。到处人群熙攘。主妇们拿着大包的年货从商店里走出来，许多搭乘各种交通车辆的人带着枞树和花束。这几天来，全国最大的国营中央百货商店每天都接纳三十万顾客，还有很多人用电话来购货。
    在即将过去的一年里，莫斯科的面貌又有了新的变化，它变得更加美丽、宏伟和宽大了。今年市内又出现了七十多个（条）新的广场和街道。全市在一年中新建了一百三十六万平方公尺的住宅，比去年多五十万平方公尺。估计全年总共将有三十万居民迁入新居。在苏联农业展览会附近和西南郊等地，建设起了四个新的住宅区。这些地区一排排崭新美观的七层上下的建筑组成了新的街道。建设者们按照首都的改建计划，今年还为学校、俱乐部、电影院、托儿所建造了许多房子。
    苏联首都的工人和知识分子在迎接新年的时候，不能不自豪地回忆起1956年中所获得的成就。在第六个五年计划的第一年里，莫斯科的工人和科学家为进一步发展科学技术作出了贡献。世界上最大的同步稳相加速器在这里建立起来，轰动世界的“图—104”喷气式客机从这里飞向许多国家的首都。许多现代化的新机器和装备从这里运往全国各地。莫斯科人在为共产主义事业辛勤地劳动着。
    莫斯科电台和邮电局正在广播和传送上百万份贺年电报。他们互相表达的主要思想是：
    恭贺为祖国的荣誉取得新的劳动胜利！
