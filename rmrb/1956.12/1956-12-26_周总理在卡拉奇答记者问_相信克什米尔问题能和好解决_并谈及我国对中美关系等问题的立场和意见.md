    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, December 25th: Premier Zhou Enlai held a press conference on the morning of the 24th before leaving Karachi for Peshawar. At the press conference, Premier Zhou expressed his belief that the Kashmir issue could be resolved amicably.

    A reporter asked Premier Zhou Enlai whether he had discussed this unresolved issue between Pakistan and India with the Prime Ministers of Pakistan and India. Premier Zhou Enlai said that he had spoken with the Prime Minister of Pakistan twice, once in Beijing and once in Karachi, and with the Prime Minister of India once in New Delhi. The issue was touched upon in these meetings.

    He said, "We are studying this issue to clarify it. We hope that Pakistan and India can resolve this issue amicably. The people of Pakistan and India have lived together for a very long time. We believe that this issue can be resolved amicably."

    When another reporter asked if China could help Pakistan and India resolve this issue through a conference, Premier Zhou Enlai said, "We are still in the study phase of this issue. In China, there is a principle that one has no right to speak without investigation."

    A reporter mentioned that, according to Indian newspapers, Indian Prime Minister Nehru had asked Premier Zhou Enlai to convey India's goodwill to Pakistan during his visit. Premier Zhou Enlai said that Indian Prime Minister Nehru had said so at a civic rally in Delhi, and he had already conveyed it.

    A reporter asked Premier Zhou Enlai whether he would be willing to hold talks with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to resolve the unresolved issues between China and the United States. Premier Zhou Enlai said that the Chinese Premier and Foreign Minister had already made this suggestion in Bandung more than a year ago and had repeatedly raised it. However, the United States has consistently ignored this suggestion. He said, "Gentlemen, you can understand how the Chinese Premier and Foreign Minister feels about this issue."

    A reporter asked whether the United States was making the release of Americans in China and the acceptance of the principle of not using force to resolve disputes as conditions for convening a meeting of the Chinese and U.S. Foreign Ministers.

    Premier Zhou Enlai said that the U.S. side had not mentioned these two issues as conditions for convening a meeting during the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks in Geneva. Moreover, we do not recognize any conditions.

    He added that these two issues are separate and should not be linked to the convening of a meeting.

    Regarding the issue of releasing prisoners, he said that the United States is demanding the release of Americans in China who have violated Chinese laws. China is also demanding that the United States release Chinese people imprisoned in the United States. These two issues are linked.

    He said that there were originally forty-four Americans in China who had violated the law. The Chinese side has successively released thirty-four of them ahead of schedule, and now there are only ten left. We have indicated that as long as these individuals behave well, they may be released early in accordance with Chinese law.

    He said that the Chinese side still does not know how many Chinese people are imprisoned in the United States, but it must be far more than the number of Americans in China who have violated the law. The United States has not provided China with a detailed list of these individuals. Only one Chinese person has been released so far, and that person developed a mental illness in prison.

    He said that this issue had already been agreed upon in the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks, and the issue now is implementation.

    Regarding the issue of both countries not using force to resolve disputes, Premier Zhou Enlai said, "We recognize this principle. However, the United States is attempting to use this principle to freeze their armed forces in the Taiwan area and make China recognize the legality of their occupation, which we cannot allow."

    He said that this issue has not been agreed upon in the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks and has been delayed.

    A reporter asked whether Premier Zhou's views on the Hungarian issue were consistent in his talks with Asian leaders.

    Premier Zhou Enlai replied that the Hungarian issue is very complex. During this visit, the issue was not discussed with the leaders of all countries. Among the leaders who did discuss this issue, our opinions were partly consistent and partly different. Western countries conducted and are continuing to conduct subversive activities in Hungary, attempting to change the existing system in Hungary. On this issue, the vast majority of the leaders I contacted agreed.

    A reporter asked whether Premier Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to Moscow was directly related to his Asian tour. The Premier replied that there was no direct relationship. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already issued a communiqué in Beijing regarding this matter.

    周总理在卡拉奇答记者问
    相信克什米尔问题能和好解决
    并谈及我国对中美关系等问题的立场和意见
    新华社卡拉奇25日电　周恩来总理24日早晨在离开卡拉奇去白沙瓦以前举行了记者招待会。总理在记者招待会上表示相信克什米尔问题是能够和好地解决的。
    记者问周恩来总理是否同巴基斯坦总理和印度总理谈到巴基斯坦和印度之间这个未决的问题。周恩来总理说，他同巴基斯坦总理谈了两次，一次在北京，一次在卡拉奇，同印度总理谈了一次，在新德里，在这些会谈中都接触到了这个问题。
    他说，我们正在研究这个问题，把这个问题搞清楚。我们希望巴基斯坦和印度能够和好地解决这个问题。巴基斯坦和印度的人民曾经很长地住在一起。我们相信这个问题是能够和好地解决的。
    在另一个记者问到中国是否可以帮助巴基斯坦和印度通过会议来解决这个问题时，周恩来总理说，我们对这个问题还在研究阶段。在中国有这样一个原则，没有研究就没有发言权。
    记者提到，据印度报纸报道，印度总理尼赫鲁曾请周恩来总理到巴基斯坦时转达印度对巴基斯坦的善意。周恩来总理说，印度总理尼赫鲁在德里举行的市民大会上就这样说过的。他已经转达了。
    记者问周恩来总理是否愿意同美国国务卿杜勒斯举行会谈解决中美之间未决的问题。周恩来总理说，中国总理兼外交部长在万隆就已经提出了这个建议，提出已经一年多了，而且还一再提出过。但是，美国对这个建议一直不理睬。他说，记者先生们，你们可以了解中国总理兼外交部长对这个问题有怎样的感触。
    记者问到美国是否以释放在中国的美国人和接受不采用武力来解决争端的原则作为召开中美外交部长会议的条件。
    周恩来总理说，在日内瓦举行的中美大使会谈中，美国方面没有谈过这两个问题是召开会议的条件。而且，我们也不承认什么条件。
    他又说，这两个问题是另外的问题，不能同召开会议放在一起。
    关于释放犯人的问题，他说，美国要求释放在中国违犯了中国法律的美国人。中国也要求美国释放在美国被监禁的中国人。这两个问题是联系在一起的。
    他说，在中国的违犯法律的美国人原先有四十四人。中国方面已先后提前释放了三十四人，现在只有十个人。我们已经表示，只要这些人表现良好，是有可能根据中国法律提前释放的。
    他说，中国方面到现在还不知道在美国究竟有多少被监禁的中国人，但是至少要比在中国的违犯了法律的美国人多得多。美国一直没有把这些人的详细的名单交给中国。到现在只有一个中国人被释放了，而那个人是在监狱里患了神经病的。
    他说，这个问题在中美两国大使会谈中早已达成协议了，现在的问题是要实行。
    关于两国不采用武力来解决争端的问题，周恩来总理说，我们承认这个原则。但是，美国企图利用这个原则来把他们在台湾地区的武装力量冻结起来，使中国承认他们侵占的合法化，这是我们不能容许的。
    他说，这个问题在中美大使会谈中一直没有达成协议，被拖延下来了。
    有个记者问到周总理在这次同亚洲国家领袖们的会谈中，在匈牙利问题上的看法是否一致。
    周恩来总理回答说，匈牙利问题是很复杂的。在这次访问中，不是同所有国家的领袖们都谈到这个问题。在谈到这个问题的领袖们中，我们的意见一部分是一致的，一部分是不同的。西方国家在匈牙利进行并且还在继续进行颠复活动，企图改变匈牙利现有的制度。在这个问题上，我接触到的领袖中绝大多数是意见一致的。
    记者问即将到来的周恩来总理到莫斯科的访问是否同他的亚洲之行有直接关系，总理回答说，没有直接关系。中国外交部已经就此事在北京发表了一个公报了。
