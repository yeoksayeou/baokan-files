    Cease U.S. Subversive Activities Against Eastern European Countries

    Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations General Assembly, proposed to the President of the United Nations General Assembly on December 12 that the Assembly immediately discuss the pressing issue of "U.S. interference in the internal affairs of people's democratic countries and its sabotage activities against these countries." Since the resolution of this issue will play a very important role in improving the current international situation, the Soviet proposal is fully in line with the wishes of all those who truly want to consolidate peace and promote international cooperation.

    U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Eastern European people's democratic countries and its subversive and destructive activities against these countries are an important part of the U.S.'s post-war policy of foreign aggression and expansion. The U.S. ruling clique believes that the existence of these countries is a serious obstacle to their pursuit of a policy of aggression and expansion, and therefore they have been painstakingly trying to subvert these countries. As early as 1947 and 1948, the U.S. ruling clique used its status as a member of the Allied Control Council and diplomatic envoys stationed in Eastern European countries to interfere in the elections in Eastern European countries, attempting to establish capitalist rule in these countries and turn them into appendages of the imperialist bloc. After this conspiracy failed, the United States instigated bourgeois politicians in Eastern European countries to launch coups in an attempt to overthrow the people's regimes in Eastern European countries. When it was no longer possible to prevent the Eastern European people from embarking on the socialist path, the U.S. ruling clique adopted a so-called "liberation" policy toward Eastern European countries. The U.S. Congress passed bills providing huge sums of money each year to recruit various reactionaries who fled from Eastern Europe, train them as spies and special agents, and send them back to Eastern European countries to carry out subversive and destructive activities. The U.S. propaganda organizations "Voice of America" and "Radio Free Europe" slandered and spread rumors about Eastern European countries, inciting people and creating incidents. The United States used military bases around Eastern European countries to release a large number of reconnaissance balloons and propaganda balloons to Eastern European countries, steal intelligence, obstruct air traffic, and disrupt the peaceful life of the Eastern European people. In June 1953, U.S. imperialism openly launched a large-scale provocative incident in Berlin.

    The U.S.'s destructive activities against Eastern European countries and its despicable acts of interfering in the internal affairs of Eastern European countries have repeatedly failed and have been condemned by righteous public opinion in various countries around the world. However, the United States has not only not given up, but has intensified its efforts year by year. This is particularly evident in the recent Hungarian incident. Many conclusive facts prove that the Hungarian counter-revolutionary armed rebellion was inseparable from the conspiracies and instigation of U.S. imperialism. According to a United Press International dispatch on November 12, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles admitted at a secret meeting of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that, except for the exact date, we "knew everything about the Hungarian uprising" in advance. Before the outbreak of the Hungarian incident, Major Jackson, a representative of the U.S. troops stationed in West Germany, also participated in the conspiracy carried out by the top leadership group of Hungarian exiles and promised to provide all necessary assistance. Therefore, from the outbreak of the riot on October 23 to November 3, reactionaries from the United States, West Germany, Austria, and other Western countries immediately sent prepared weapons and counter-revolutionaries into Hungary batch by batch via trains, cars, airplanes, and parachutes to establish contact and carry out command. It was precisely because of careful preparation in advance that the counter-revolutionaries were able to systematically and organizedly seize armories, organize transportation to transport weapons, and attack predetermined targets at the beginning of the incident.

    The subversive and destructive activities of U.S. imperialism against the Eastern European people's democratic countries are part of a frenzied offensive against the socialist camp and the world socialist movement. They want to put the people of Eastern European countries back into the shackles of capitalist enslavement and turn the entire Eastern European region from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea into a base for launching anti-Soviet wars. This rampant provocative behavior of the United States not only blatantly violates the universally accepted principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and undermines the purposes of the United Nations Charter, but is also a major source of international tension after the war.

    Peaceful life within Hungary is now gradually returning to normal, and social order is gradually consolidating. However, the imperialist group headed by the United States is still using every means possible at home and abroad to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs, continuing to instigate and support counter-revolutionaries in carrying out destructive activities against the Hungarian People's Republic. Obviously, if this action of the United States does not stop for a day, the threat to the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of the Hungarian people cannot be eliminated for a day, and the international situation and international relations cannot tend toward relaxation and normalization for a day. Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly should immediately discuss the important proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation and take measures to condemn and stop U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Eastern European countries and its subversive and destructive activities against Eastern Europe. This is a major test of whether the United Nations organization can maintain the dignity and prestige of its Charter.

### 制止美国对东欧各国的颠覆活动

    制止美国对东欧各国的颠覆活动
    苏联出席联合国大会代表团团长库兹涅佐夫在12月12日向联合国大会主席提出建议，要求大会立即讨论“美国对人民民主国家内政的干涉和它对这些国家的破坏活动”这一迫切问题。由于这个问题的解决对改善当前国际局势将具有十分重要的作用，因此苏联的这个建议是完全符合一切真正要求巩固和平和增进国际合作的人们的愿望的。
    美国对东欧人民民主国家内政的干涉和对这些国家进行的颠覆破坏活动，是战后美国对外侵略扩张政策的重要组成部分。美国统治集团认为这些国家的存在，是它们推行侵略扩张政策的严重障碍，因此处心积虑地企图颠覆这些国家。早在1947、1948年时，美国统治集团就曾经利用盟国管制委员会委员的身份和驻东欧各国的外交使节，干预东欧各国的选举，企图使这些国家建立资本主义统治，成为帝国主义集团的附庸。这个阴谋失败以后，美国又指使东欧各国的资产阶级政客策动政变，企图推翻东欧各国的人民政权。当已经无法阻止东欧人民走上社会主义道路时，美国统治集团就对东欧各国采取了所谓“解放”政策。美国国会通过的法案中规定每年拨付巨款，网罗从东欧流亡出来的各种反动分子，把他们训练成为间谍特务，重新潜入东欧各国进行颠覆破坏活动。美国的宣传机构“美国之音”和“自由欧洲电台”对东欧各国进行诽谤造谣，煽动人心，制造事端。美国利用在东欧各国周围的军事基地对东欧各国放送了大量的侦察气球和宣传气球，窃取情报，妨碍空中交通，扰乱东欧人民的和平生活。1953年6月，美帝国主义在柏林公然发动大规模的挑衅事件。
    美国对东欧各国所进行的破坏活动和干涉东欧各国内政的卑劣行为，曾经一再遭到失败，并受到世界各国正义舆论的谴责。但是，美国不但没有死心，反而一年比一年变本加厉了。这在最近发生的匈牙利事件中表现得特别明显。许多确凿的事实证明，这次匈牙利反革命武装暴乱事件，是同美帝国主义的阴谋策划分不开的。据合众社11月12日的电讯，美国中央情报局局长艾伦·杜勒斯在美国参议院外交委员会秘密会议上承认说：除了确切的日期以外，我们在事先“就知道有关匈牙利暴动的一切情况了”。在匈牙利事件爆发之前，美国驻西德部队的代表杰克逊少校也参与了匈牙利流亡者的最高领导集团所进行的密谋，并许诺给以一切必要的援助。因此，在从10月23日暴乱事件爆发到11月3日之间，美国、西德、奥地利和其他西方国家的反动派，就立即把准备好的武器和反革命分子经过火车、汽车、飞机、降落伞一批一批地送入匈牙利，建立联络，从事指挥。正是因为事先经过周密的准备，反革命分子才在事件一开始时就有计划有组织地分头抢夺军火库，组织交通工具运输武器和进攻预定的目标。
    美帝国主义对东欧人民民主国家的颠覆破坏活动，是对社会主义阵营和世界社会主义运动实行疯狂进攻的一部分。它们想使东欧各国人民重新套上资本主义奴役的枷锁，把从波罗的海到黑海的整个东欧地区重新变成为进行反苏战争的基地。美国这种猖狂的挑衅行为，不仅粗暴地违反了不干涉他国内政的国际共守的原则，破坏了联合国宪章的宗旨，而且也是战后国际紧张局势的一个主要根源。
    匈牙利国内的和平生活现在正在逐步恢复，社会正常秩序也在逐渐巩固。但是以美国为首的帝国主义集团今天仍在联合国内外千方百计地企图干涉匈牙利的内政，继续唆使和支持反革命分子对匈牙利人民共和国进行破坏活动。显然，如果美国的这种行动一天不停止，对于匈牙利人民的自由独立和主权的威胁就一天不能消除，国际局势和国际关系就一天也不可能趋向和缓和正常。因此，联合国大会应该立即讨论苏联代表团所提出的重要建议，并采取措施谴责和制止美国对东欧各国内政的干涉和对东欧的颠复破坏活动。这是对联合国组织能否维持宪章的尊严和威信的重大考验。
