Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 25th: The Asian Writers' Conference held consecutive plenary sessions on the morning and afternoon of December 24th. The afternoon session discussed cultural exchange among Asian countries and the issue of Asian traditions. All representatives who addressed these issues spoke of the ancient cultural ties between Asian nations, which were at one time damaged by Western rule. They called for the restoration and strengthening of these ties and put forward specific suggestions in this regard.

When discussing cultural exchange, the head of the Burmese delegation, U Thant Pe Myint, spoke first, tracing the cultural relations between Burma and India, Ceylon, Thailand, and China since ancient times. He suggested that universities in all Asian countries conduct cultural research, and advocated building trust to promote these cultural ties, establishing magazines, and undertaking the translation of important works from Asian countries.

The head of the Pakistani delegation, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and Dr. K.B. Rao of India both supported these suggestions.

When discussing the issue of Asian traditions, Ye Shengtao, a member of the Chinese writers' delegation, said: "Every country has a rich literary and artistic heritage, and these heritages together form a beautiful garden for all mankind."

He traced the history of Chinese literary traditions, pointing out that "the tradition of loving peace and hating war is very evident in Chinese culture. This tradition can be seen in Chinese literature of all eras." Chinese literature has always reflected the national spirit. At the same time, foreign influences have also enriched Chinese literature. "Today in China, all the good things in our cultural heritage have been accepted by the people, and we will further develop them."

Ye Shengtao said: "We believe that by introducing our own literary traditions to promote mutual understanding among the people of all countries, and through various means, we can all make significant contributions to human culture, world peace, and the future happiness of mankind."

Mulk Raj Anand of India emphasized the need to restore the most valuable aspects of past traditions. He welcomed the growing trend of humanism in China and India. He said that what rising Asia needs first and foremost is a certain unity to solve Asian problems. He said that rising Asia, after shaking off the shackles of foreign rule, will undoubtedly make great progress, and great works will soon emerge in Asia.

K. Navaratnam of Ceylon also spoke on this issue.

At the plenary session in the morning, the representatives continued to hear reports on the literary situation in Asian countries.

Former Governor-General of India, Rajagopalachari, congratulated the Asian writers. He said that among them, "I feel that I am in Asia, not just in India."

When Ramaswami Aiyer, former Vice-Chancellor of Benares University in India, spoke, he said: Today, rising Asia is striving for new forms of expression in politics, economics, and society, but in art and literature, there has not yet been the same powerful impetus, despite the great efforts made in various countries. He hoped that this conference would study this situation and promote the development of Asian literature.

The head of the Soviet writers' delegation, Mirzo Tursunzoda, greeted the representatives in Tajik, which drew enthusiastic cheers from the meeting. He said that true literature produces light and warmth. "Our first word must be peace; without peace, we cannot defend life and literature."

The famous Soviet writer Konstantin Simonov attended the conference as an observer and conveyed the congratulations of Soviet writers to the conference. He said: The development of literature and colonialism cannot coexist. Soviet writers pledge to do everything possible to help the development of literature and to help literature break free from the shackles of colonialism. The Soviet people and Soviet writers still remember how ethnic minorities and their cultures were suppressed during Tsarist Russia. Today, such suppression no longer exists in the Soviet Union, and the literature of all sixty different languages is equal. Soviet writers believe that it is the greatest and most noble task to contribute to the brotherhood between different nationalities in the world and to contribute to their common goal – peace.

Yosida Zen'ei of Japan said that Japan's new literature is deeply inspired by the struggle against foreign occupation and the stationing of foreign troops. Japanese writers welcome the breaking of Japan's isolation from other peace-loving countries.

Han Sorya of Korea pointed out that in Korea, the new trend in literature is linked to the heroic struggle of the people against foreign aggressors. He also said that today's Korean literature reflects the peaceful reconstruction work, post-war life, the struggle for socialist construction, the people's strong desire to strengthen friendship with the Chinese people, and their patriotic sentiment of hoping for the reunification of their country. Therefore, today's Korean literature is faithful to life, very close to life, and full of humanism.

Faiz Ahmed Faiz said that in Pakistan, the end of colonial rule has led to a revival of literature, especially the literature of local languages. He pointed out that there is a strong desire in Pakistani literature to restore the traditions that were interrupted by foreign rule.

The head of the Nepalese delegation suggested the establishment of an Asian Writers' Association. He said that Nepalese writers look forward to Asian solidarity based on Panchsheel, and their country's friendly relations with India and China have inspired them to write more creative works.

Nguyen Cong Hoan, head of the delegation from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, introduced the literary situation in Vietnam and pointed out how writers in North and South Vietnam are "united by their love for their common motherland and their desire to see our country no longer in a state of division."

Nguyen Huu Thong of South Vietnam said that in South Vietnam, there is also a trend towards establishing a traditional, humane literature.

    各国代表主张恢复和加强被殖民主义破坏了的文化联系
    苏联作家代表团长强调没有和平就不能保卫生命和文学
    新华社新德里25日电　亚洲作家会议24日上午和下午连续举行了全体会议。下午的会议讨论了亚洲国家间的文化交流问题和亚洲的传统问题。所有谈到这些问题的代表都谈到古代亚洲国家之间的文化联系，由于西方的统治，这种联系有一个时候遭到了破坏。他们要求恢复和加强这种联系，并且在这方面提出了具体的建议。
    缅甸代表团团长吴登佩密在讨论文化交流问题的时候首先发言，他追述了缅甸同印度、锡兰、泰国和中国从古代以来的文化关系。他建议所有亚洲国家的大学进行文化研究工作；并且主张建立起信任以促进这种文化联系，创办杂志，着手翻译亚洲国家的重要著作。
    巴基斯坦代表团团长费兹·艾哈迈德·费兹和印度的克·布·拉奥博士都支持这些建议。
    在讨论亚洲的传统问题的时候，中国作家代表团团员叶圣陶说：“每一个国家都有丰富的文学和艺术遗产，这些遗产加在一起形成了全人类的美丽的花园。”
    他追述了关于中国文学的传统的历史，指出“爱好和平憎恨战争的传统在中国文化中是很明显的。在各个时代的中国文学中都能够看到这种传统”。中国文学一向是反映民族精神的。同时，外国的影响也丰富了中国文学。“今天在中国，我们文化遗产中所有好的东西都被人民接受下来了，而且我们将进一步加以发扬光大”。
    叶圣陶说：“我们相信，介绍我们自己的文学传统，以促进各国人民之间的互相了解，通过各种办法，我们大家都可以对人类文化以及世界和平和人类未来的幸福作出重大贡献。”
    印度的穆尔克·拉志·阿南德强调要恢复过去的传统中最有价值的东西。他欢迎在中国和印度日益得势的人道主义的态度。他说，兴起的亚洲需要的首先是某种团结，以便解决亚洲的问题。他说，兴起的亚洲在摆脱掉外国的枷锁以后，无疑地将有巨大的进步，而且在亚洲不久就会产生伟大的作品。
    锡兰的克·纳瓦拉特纳姆也谈到这个问题。
    在上午的全体会议上代表们继续听取了关于亚洲国家的文学情况的报告。
    前印度总督拉贾戈帕拉查里向亚洲作家们表示祝贺。他说，在他们当中，“我感到我是在亚洲，而不是在印度。”
    印度贝拿勒斯大学前副校长腊马斯瓦米·艾耶尔发言的时候说：今天，兴起的亚洲无论在政治、经济、社会各方面都在努力求得新的表现形式，在艺术和文学方面却还没有同样有力的推动力，尽管各个国家内作出了巨大的努力。他希望这次会议能够研究这种情况，推动亚洲文学的发展。
    苏联作家代表团团长米尔佐·图尔森—扎杰用塔吉克斯坦语向代表们致意，会上发出了热烈的欢呼声。他说，真正的文学产生光明和温暖。“我们的第一句话必须是和平，没有和平我们就不能保卫生命和文学。”
    苏联著名作家西蒙诺夫以观察员身份参加了会议，他代表苏联作家向会议表示祝贺。他说：文学的发展和殖民主义是不能共存的。苏联作家保证尽一切力量帮助文学的发展，帮助文学摆脱殖民主义的枷锁。苏联人民和苏联作家还记得在沙皇俄国的时候少数民族和他们的文化怎样受到压制。今天，苏联不再存在这种压制，所有六十种不同语言的文学都是平等的。苏联作家认为，为世界上不同民族间的兄弟之谊出力和为他们共同的目标——和平出力是最伟大、最崇高不过的一项任务。
    日本的?田善卫说，日本的新的文学深受反对外国占领和反对外国军队驻扎的斗争的鼓舞。日本作家们欢迎打破日本与其他爱好和平的国家隔离状况。
    朝鲜作家韩雪野指出，在朝鲜，文学的新趋势是和人民反对外国侵略者的英勇斗争连结在一起的。他又说，今天朝鲜的文学反映了和平的重建工作、战后的生活、为建设社会主义进行的斗争、人民希望加强与中国人民的友谊的强烈愿望以及他们希望他们的国家重新统一的爱国情绪。因此，今天的朝鲜文学是忠实于生活的，是非常接近生活和充满人道主义的。
    费兹·艾哈迈德·费兹说，在巴基斯坦，殖民统治的结束导致了文学的复兴，特别是地方语言文学的复兴。他指出，巴基斯坦文学当中存在着把外国统治所打断了的传统恢复起来的强烈愿望。
    尼泊尔代表团团长建议成立亚洲作家协会。他说，尼泊尔作家展望着以潘查希拉为基础的亚洲团结，他们的国家同印度和中国的友好关系使他们有了写出更多创造性作品的灵感。
    越南民主共和国代表团团长阮公欢介绍了越南的文学状况，并且指出北越和南越的作家们是怎样由于“热爱共同的祖国和希望看到我们国家不再处于分裂状态而团结起来的”。
    南越的阮友通说，在南越也出现了建立传统的、富于人情味的文学的趋势。
