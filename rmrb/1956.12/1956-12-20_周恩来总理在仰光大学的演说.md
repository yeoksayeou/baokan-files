Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at Rangoon University

Respected Principal U Ba Swe,
Respected Vice-Principal,
Professors,
Young Friends,

Thank you for such a warm welcome. I salute you in the name of Chinese students and Chinese youth!

I am particularly excited to meet the vibrant and spirited Burmese youth, because youth is the hope of a nation. Seeing the youth of Burma is like seeing the future of Burma.

I am especially excited because we are now meeting with you at the renowned Rangoon University. We deeply respect your university because it is not only the highest institution of learning in Burma but also an important center of Burma's independence struggle. Almost an entire generation of representatives of Burma's independence struggle emerged from here. General Aung San, Chairman U Nu, Premier U Ba Swe, and many other leaders of political activities all conducted their struggle for national independence here. A country can be proud to have such a university, and a youth can be envied for being able to study at such a university.

In underdeveloped countries like China and Burma, intellectuals often bear particularly significant responsibilities. If the historical mission of the older generation of Rangoon University students was to fight for Burma's independence, then you bear the responsibility of defending and consolidating Burma's independence and building Burma into a modern country. From our own experience, we know that this is an arduous task, but also a glorious and great one.

The vast majority of our Asian and African countries, including China and Burma, are still economically and culturally relatively backward. Colonialists in the past took advantage of and deepened our backwardness to bully, oppress, and invade us. In order to resist colonialist aggression and strive for national independence, the people of our two countries have waged extremely arduous struggles and paid an extremely heavy price. Now, we have each won political independence, but we have not yet escaped our economic and cultural backwardness. In this sense, our independence is still incomplete, even unconsolidated. Until we have escaped this backwardness, we cannot say that we have been exempted from the danger of being re-invaded by colonialism. The armed aggression launched by British and French colonialists against Egypt a few months ago should be considered a serious warning to us.

It is precisely from this starting point that, after completing the liberation of the country, we Chinese people have made national construction and industrialization our all-out goals. However, to defend and consolidate national independence and achieve national industrialization, it is impossible without a group of intellectuals with expertise in various academic fields. And the current situation we face is a great lack of such intellectuals.

Taking China's situation as an example, we are a country with a population of 600 million. However, due to colonialism hindering the development of our education, when the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, our higher education institutions had only 116,000 students. This situation has forced us to make great efforts in recent years to develop education, especially higher education. This year, our higher education institutions have 380,000 students. In the past seven years, we have trained more than 300,000 higher education students. This number exceeds all the higher education students trained in China in the past fifty years. However, our construction talents are still far from sufficient. For example, the number of university graduates this summer cannot meet the needs of all aspects, and their academic level is still not fully adapted to the requirements. We must continue to work hard in the future to train intellectuals who meet the needs of the country.

We are very pleased to hear that after Burma's independence, the number of students at Rangoon University from all over the country has increased from more than 1,000 to 12,000. We wish your school continued development, wish the ranks of Burmese intellectuals continued expansion, wish you new achievements in your studies, and that you will make contributions to the cause of building Burma worthy of your predecessors.

China and Burma jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Maintaining world peace and promoting international friendship are our common aspirations. We believe that countries with different social systems should and can coexist peacefully. In this noble cause, we also place great hopes on the youth of our two countries. Our two countries have a long history of friendship and are related like relatives. The Burmese people call the Chinese people "Paukphaw" (compatriots). Therefore, we should not only develop friendly relations in our generation but also maintain increasingly friendly relations forever in future generations. We must do this.

In the past, our Asian and African countries have suffered greatly from being divided and provoked by colonialists, and thus being oppressed and enslaved. We must never allow this tragic history to repeat itself. We will certainly be able to do this.

As far as China is concerned, we have established a people's democratic system, which has eliminated the possibility of a few people profiting from launching wars of aggression abroad. Our government firmly implements a policy of promoting peaceful coexistence among all countries. At the same time, we are also educating our people, especially our young people, with the ideas of maintaining peace, internationalism, and the Five Principles. Recently, under the call of Chairman Mao Zedong in our country, we are making every effort to "resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate great-power chauvinism," so that our descendants will always treat all countries in the world, large and small, with an equal attitude.

There is no doubt that this is also welcomed by our Burmese young friends. We believe that through the joint efforts of both sides, it can be fully realized.

Of course, there are still some historical problems in the relations between our two countries. We are already starting to gradually resolve these problems. As long as we firmly act in accordance with the Five Principles, the resolution of these problems will not encounter insurmountable difficulties. We believe that with the joint efforts of both sides, these problems can be resolved.

We must not only resolve the historical problems in the relations between our two countries but also actively develop friendly cooperation in economic, cultural, and other fields on the basis of the Five Principles.

At present, our two countries have made considerable progress in trade and economic cooperation, and we must gradually expand it in the future. This equal and mutually beneficial cooperation without any conditions attached is conducive to the independent development of the economies of our two countries.

The border residents' conference held by Burma in Laykyun earlier this year and the China-Burma border people's joint celebration held in Mangshi, China, two days ago have played a significant role in enhancing the friendship between the people of our two countries. We should continue to strengthen such connections.

Our two countries have made some progress in cultural exchanges, and there is still much work to be done. We believe that every country, regardless of size, has its own strengths that are worth learning from other countries. Our Asian countries have had a long history of learning from each other, and now we should learn from each other even more. Because many of the problems we face in our two countries are similar or identical in nature, the experience we have in solving these problems is worth learning from and referring to each other. Such mutual learning can enrich our respective cultures and also enhance our understanding of each other, which is conducive to the friendship between our two countries.

Burmese young friends: The friendly cooperation between our two countries is an undertaking of great significance. In the past, Asian and African countries became colonies or semi-colonies because they lacked strong unity and fell victim to the colonialists' conspiracy to defeat them one by one. In the past, the people of the world repeatedly suffered the tragic disasters of war imposed on them because they lacked strong unity. We must forever unite in friendship on the basis of the Five Principles! As long as we can do this, any attack by colonialism can be defeated.

We are now in an era of awakening, resistance, and victory for all oppressed nations.

In our Asian and African regions, this trend is particularly evident. In the decade since the end of World War II, a series of countries, including China and Burma, which together account for more than half of the world's population, have achieved independence from the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, to the Atlantic Ocean.

Since the first Asian-African Conference held in Bandung in April 1955, the anti-colonialist struggle worldwide has developed to a new climax. The heroic action of the Egyptian people in seizing the Suez Canal from the colonialists is a prominent symbol. Of course, colonialists still exist and still have power. They try to threaten us with war, divide us with divisive tricks, weaken us, and undermine us with subversive activities, but they are no longer as successful as they used to be. As the situation in Egypt shows, due to the sympathy and support expressed by the peace-loving and justice-upholding forces of the world, especially the governments and people of Asian and African countries, the open armed aggression of Britain, France, and their follower Israel against Egypt has not achieved its purpose and is beginning to suffer the consequences. Similarly, the subversive activities carried out by the imperialists within the socialist camp have not yielded the desired results.

The people, who constitute the vast majority of mankind and have long been ruled by colonialism, have now broken away from their former position of being manipulated and are resolutely demanding to control their own destiny. They demand independence, demand peace, demand friendship, demand progress, and are using unparalleled strength to eliminate all obstacles and move towards their goals. This is the irresistible trend of our times. Compared with the vast majority of people, the colonialists are only a very small minority and are extremely isolated. Even if they may be rampant for a while, they can never save their destined failure, just as the dark clouds in the sky can never block the sun from shining on the earth. No matter what twists and turns there may be, our world must move towards progress and will never move towards reaction.

Young people of Burma, you are fortunate to be growing up in this era. I wish you to fully grasp the trend of our times and complete the ideals pursued by our times in your hands.

I wish you to study hard, learn your skills well, and work together with the people of Burma to build your country.

Young friends, the future is yours, strive forward! (Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon)

### 周恩来总理在仰光大学的演说

专栏：

    周恩来总理在仰光大学的演说敬爱的校长吴巴瑞总理敬爱的副校长先生诸位教授先生青年朋友们：
    谢谢你们给我们这样热烈的欢迎。我以中国学生和中国青年的名义向你们致敬！
    同朝气蓬勃、精神奋发的缅甸青年见面，使我感到特别兴奋，因为青年是国家的希望，看见缅甸的青年就是看到了缅甸的明天。
    使我感到格外兴奋的是：我们现在是在著名的仰光大学同你们会见，我们十分尊敬你们的学校，因为它不但是缅甸的最高学府，而且是缅甸独立斗争的一个重要中心。这里产生了几几乎整个一代的缅甸独立斗争的代表人物。昂山将军、吴努主席、吴巴瑞总理和其他许多政治活动的领导人物都是曾经在这里进行过他们争取民族独立的斗争的。一个国家能够有这样的一个大学是值得自豪的，一个青年能够在这样的一个大学里学习是值得羡慕的。
    在像中国和缅甸这样的落后国家中，知识分子常常担负着特别重大的责任。如果说老一辈的仰光大学学生的历史使命是争取缅甸的独立，那么，在你们的身上就担负着保卫和巩固缅甸的独立并且把缅甸建设成为一个近代化的国家的责任。我们凭自己的经验知道，这是一个艰巨的任务，然而也是一个光荣的、伟大的任务。
    我们亚洲和非洲的绝大多数国家，包括中国和缅甸在内，在经济上和文化上都还是较落后的国家。殖民主义者过去就是利用和加深了我们的这种落后才能欺负我们，压迫我们，侵略我们。为了反抗殖民主义的侵略和争取国家的独立，我们两国人民曾经进行了极其艰苦的斗争，付出了极其巨大的代价。现在，我们各自赢得了政治上的独立，但是我们却都还没有摆脱我们经济上和文化上的落后状态。从这一方面来说，我们的独立都还是不完全的，甚至是不巩固的。在我们还没有摆脱这种落后状态以前，我们就还不能说已经免除了重遭殖民主义侵略的危险。几个月以前，英法殖民主义者对埃及发动的武装侵略，应该认为是给我们提出的严重警告。
    正是从这里出发，我们中国人民在完成了国家的解放以后，就把建设祖国，实现工业化作为我们全力以赴的目标。然而，要保卫和巩固民族独立，要实现国家工业化，没有一批对各种学术部门具有专长的知识分子是不可能的。而我们目前所面临的现状，却是很缺乏这样的知识分子。
    拿我们中国的情况来说，我们是一个有六万万人口的国家，然而由于殖民主义阻碍了我们的教育事业的发展，在1949年中华人民共和国成立的时候，我们的高等学校一共只有十一万六千名学生。这种情况使我们这几年来不得不以极大的努力来发展教育事业，特别是高等教育事业。今年我们的高等学校已经有三十八万名学生。七年以来，我们培养了三十万以上的高等学校学生，这个数字超过了过去五十多年间中国所培养出来的全部高等学校学生。但是，我们的建设人才还是远远感到不足，像今年夏天毕业的大学生在人数上就不能满足各方面的需要，他们的学术水平也还是不能完全适应要求。我们今后还必须继续努力，来培养适应国家需要的知识分子。
    我们很高兴听说，缅甸独立后仰光大学在全国各地的学生已经从一千余人增加到一万二千人。我们祝你们的学校不断发展，祝缅甸知识分子的队伍不断扩大，祝你们在学习中取得新的成就，将来在建设缅甸事业中作出无愧于你们的前辈同学的贡献。
    中国和缅甸曾经共同倡议了和平共处的五项原则。维护世界和平和促进国际友好是我们的共同愿望。我们认为，不同社会制度的国家应该，而且完全可以和平共处。在这个崇高的事业中，我们也把很大的希望寄予我们两国的青年。我们两国有悠久的友谊而且是亲戚的国家。缅甸人民称中国人民为“胞波”（同胞）。因此，我们不但应该在我们这一代要发展友好的关系，而且应该在今后的世世代代中都永远保持愈来愈友好的关系。我们一定要做到这一点。
    在过去的年代中，我们亚非国家已经吃尽了受殖民主义者分裂挑拨因而被压迫被奴役的苦头，我们无论如何不能再让这种悲惨的历史重演。我们也一定能够做到这一点。
    就我们中国来说，我们已经建立了人民民主的制度，杜绝了少数人利用向外进行侵略战争来谋利的可能。我国的政府坚定不移地执行着促进各国间和平共处的政策。同时，我们也正在把维护和平的思想，国际主义的思想，五项原则的思想，教育我国的人民，特别是我国的青年人。最近在我国毛泽东主席的号召下，我们正在尽一切努力，要“坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭大国主义”，让我们的后代永远以平等的态度对待世界上所有大小国家。
    毫无疑问，这也是我们的缅甸青年朋友所欢迎的。我们相信，经过我们双方共同的努力，它是完全可以实现的。
    当然，在我们两国之间的关系中，目前还有若干历史上遗留下来的问题。我们已经在着手逐步解决这些问题。只要坚决按照五项原则办事，这些问题的解决不会遇到不可克服的困难。我们相信，在双方的共同努力之下，这些问题是可以得到解决的。
    我们不但要解决我们两国关系中历史上遗留下来的问题；而且还要在五项原则的基础上积极地发展在经济上和文化上以及其他各方面的友好合作。
    现在我们两国在贸易往来和经济合作方面已经有了相当的发展，今后还必须逐步加以扩大。这种平等互利不附带任何条件的合作是有利于我们两国经济的独立发展的。
    今年年初缅甸在雷基召开的边民大会和两天以前中国在芒市举行的中缅两国边境人民联欢大会对于增进我们两国人民的友谊起了很大的作用。这样的联系我们应该不断地加强它。
    我们两国在文化交流方面有了一些发展，还有许多工作有待我们去做。我们认为每一个国家，不论大小，都是有它自己的长处值得其他国家学习。我们亚洲国家过去曾经有过长期彼此学习的历史，现在我们更加应该互相学习。因为我们两国面临的许多问题是性质相似或者相同的，我们解决这些问题的经验值得我们互相学习和参考。这样的相互学习可以丰富我们各自的文化，也可以增进我们彼此间的了解，有助于我们两国的友好。
    缅甸青年朋友们：我们两国之间的友好合作是有着重大意义的事业。亚非国家过去就是因为缺乏坚强的团结而在殖民主义各个击破的阴谋下沦为殖民地或者半殖民地。世界人民过去就是因为缺乏坚强的团结而一再遭到强加在他们身上的战争的惨祸。我们一定要在五项原则的基础上，永远地友好团结下去！只要我们能够做到这一点，殖民主义的任何进攻就都是可以被击败的。
    我们现在是处在一切被压迫民族觉醒、反抗而且走向胜利的时代。
    在我们亚洲和非洲地区，这种趋向尤其表现得明显。在第二次世界大战结束以后的十年间，从太平洋、印度洋到大西洋，已经拥有世界一半以上人口的一系列国家取得了独立，其中就有中国和缅甸。
    自从1955年4月在万隆举行的第一次亚非会议以来，全世界反殖民主义斗争，发展到了新的高潮。埃及人民从殖民主义者手中夺回苏伊士运河的英勇行动，就是一个突出的标志。当然，殖民主义者还存在，也还有力量。他们企图以战争威胁我们，以挑拨离间的伎俩来分裂我们，削弱我们，以颠复活动来破坏我们，但是他们都已经不像过去那样称心如意了。就像埃及的情况所表明的那样，由于全世界爱好和平和主张正义的力量，首先是亚非国家的政府和人民表示的同情和声援，英国、法国和它们的追随者以色列对埃及的公开武装侵略并没有达到目的，而且正在开始自食其恶果。同样，帝国主义者在社会主义阵营内部进行的颠复活动，结果也不是如意的。
    占据人类绝大多数的、长期受殖民主义统治的人民，现在已经脱离了过去那种任人支配的地位而坚决要求掌握自己的命运。他们要求独立，要求和平，要求友好，要求进步，而且正在以无比的力量排除一切阻碍走向自己的目的，这就是我们的时代的不可抗拒的潮流。比起广大的人民来，殖民主义者不过是极小的少数，而且是极其孤立的。纵然，他们还可能有一时的猖獗，但是无论如何挽救不了自己注定要失败的命运的，就像天上的乌云无论如何挡不住太阳普照大地一样。不论有什么曲折，我们的世界一定要走向进步，而决不会走向反动。
    缅甸的青年们，你们生长在这个时代是幸福的，我祝你们充分把握住我们时代的潮流，在你们的手里完成我们时代所追求的理想。
    我祝你们努力学习，学好本领，同缅甸人民一起同心协力来建设你们的国家。
    青年朋友们，未来是你们的，努力前进吧！（新华社仰光电）
