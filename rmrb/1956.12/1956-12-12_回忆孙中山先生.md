    Remembering Mr. Sun Yat-sen
  　Chen Jiageng
    I joined the Tongmenghui in Singapore. Mr. Sun Yat-sen went to Singapore many times. After the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen rushed back to China and met with me again in Singapore, where we discussed the revolution. Because I was not proficient in Mandarin or Cantonese, although we met, we did not talk much. After that, Mr. Sun Yat-sen returned to China and I did not see him again until his death. Now I only recall some past events to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's birth.
    In the past, many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia went abroad after failing to oppose the Qing Dynasty in China. For example, many revolutionary comrades of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and the Xiamen Small Sword Society fled south to seek refuge after their uprisings failed. They organized various secret societies in Singapore to encourage the patriotism of overseas Chinese. At that time, the Malayan colonial government needed overseas Chinese to go to reclaim land, allowing the overseas Chinese to move freely and support the revolution in their motherland. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was deeply moved by the patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese, so he called "overseas Chinese the mother of the revolution."
    There is a small Western-style building in Singapore, originally a club for a few people, which was repeatedly used as Mr. Sun Yat-sen's residence. One evening, many people sat and talked. Mr. Sun Yat-sen suggested that a national flag should be established. After discussion, it was decided to be the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag. It was all blue with a white circle in the center. There was nothing else outside the white circle. (The later Blue Sky with a White Sun flag had twelve triangular tips added outside the white circle, which was different from what was decided at that time.) After the decision, a waiter served Mr. Sun Yat-sen a glass of boiled water and put it on the table, which suddenly turned red. Everyone was surprised, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen was immediately pleased and said, "Red is auspicious." Then he took it and drank it. Also, a large group of birds gathered and roosted in the building for a while, and then flew away. This matter was accidental, but the boiled water turning red is unknown, which is quite thought-provoking.
    Not long after the Wuchang Uprising, it was reported that Fuzhou had been restored. The Singapore Hokkien Association immediately convened a meeting, fearing local chaos, and raised funds to help maintain law and order, establishing a relief organization called the Fujian Security Association, and elected me as chairman. Several tens of thousands of dollars were donated on the spot, and a telegram was sent to Huang Naishang, the father-in-law of Mr. Lin Wenguang in Fujian Province, asking if the restoration had indeed taken place and who had been elected as the governor. They also informed him that they planned to donate funds for relief. The next day, a reply telegram was received: the restoration was indeed true, the governor was Sun Daoren, and the provincial treasury was empty, so send funds for emergency relief. So two thousand dollars were immediately remitted, and the remaining funds were subsequently remitted continuously. Also, because Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou had always been prone to incidents, they were asked to do their best to maintain law and order. After receiving the letter, Huang Naishang declared that the overseas Chinese in Singapore had remitted two hundred thousand dollars and could continue to remit one million dollars, so he made this statement to reassure the people. The fact is that the Minnan overseas Chinese in Singapore donated and remitted about two hundred thousand dollars in one month. Mr. Sun Yat-sen happened to be returning to China from Europe on a British mail ship, passing through Singapore and staying at Mr. Chen Wulie's residence. The next day, he took the original ship to Shanghai. The Singapore Security Association gave him fifty thousand dollars to help his journey. Since then, I have not seen Mr. Sun Yat-sen again. The small Western-style building where Mr. Sun Yat-sen lived in Singapore has also been purchased to commemorate him.
    Mr. Sun Yat-sen purchased second-class berths for several trips from Singapore to Europe. The last time he returned to China, although he had the status of a national leader, he still bought a second-class berth. The reason for this was not only to save money, but also because first-class passengers had to wear formal attire for every meal, which he considered to have aristocratic overtones, so he did not exclusively buy first-class berths.

    回忆孙中山先生
  　陈嘉庚
    我在新加坡加入同盟会。中山先生屡往新加坡。辛亥革命发生后，中山先生赶回国内，途经新加坡，又和他见过面，谈论革命情事。我因不能谙国语及粤语，故虽有见面，谈话不多。此后中山先生回国，直至谢世，都未见面。兹仅回忆一些往事，用以纪念中山先生诞生九十周年。
    南洋华侨昔日不少是在国内反对清朝失败后出国者，如太平天国及厦门小刀会诸革命同志，因起义失败南逃避难者不少，他们在新加坡组织多样会党，鼓励华侨爱国。当时马来亚殖民政府正需华侨前往开垦，任凭华侨自由活动，赞助祖国革命。孙中山先生对华侨爱国热情，深为感动，故称“华侨为革命之母”。
    新加坡有一座小洋楼，原为少数人俱乐部，屡作中山先生寓所。有一晚多人坐谈。中山先生建议应设一国旗，由是互相讨论，结果定为青天白日旗。系全面青地，中央一个白圆圈。白圈以外，别无其他（后来的青天白日旗，在白圈外另加十二个三角尖，与当时所订的不同。）议定后适招待员奉中山先生一杯白开水置桌上，忽然变为红色。众方惊讶，中山先生即喜曰：“红者大吉”。随取而饮之。又大群鸟，集宿楼屋有顷，然后飞去。此事属偶然，但白开水变红不知何故，颇耐人寻味。
    武昌起义后不多日，报载福州光复，新加坡福建会馆即召集会议，恐地方纷乱，乃筹款以助治安，成立一救济机关，名为福建保安会，举我任会长。当场捐数万元，并电福建省问林文广先生之岳父黄乃裳，是否果已光复，都督举何人？并告以此间拟捐款救济。越日得回电：光复确实，都督孙道仁，省库如洗，速汇款救急，于是立即汇去二万元，嗣后又将余款继续汇去。又以厦门、泉州、漳州素来多故，并请极力维持治安。黄乃裳接信后，扬言新加坡华侨已汇来二十万元，尚可续汇百万元，故作此语，以安民心。事实是新加坡闽侨在一个月内共捐汇二十万元左右。孙中山先生适于其时由欧洲搭英邮船回国，途经新加坡，寓陈武烈先生住宅。越宿仍乘原轮往沪。新加坡保安会赠五万元壮其行色。自此以后，我未再见孙中山先生。孙中山先生在新加坡时所住之小洋楼，亦已购来，以留纪念。
    中山先生几度由新加坡往欧洲，所购船位，概是二等舱位。最后一次回国时，虽有全国领袖之地位，仍是购二等舱位。其原因不但为节俭，亦因一等位乘客每餐须衣礼服，嫌其有贵族色彩，故不专购一等舱位。
