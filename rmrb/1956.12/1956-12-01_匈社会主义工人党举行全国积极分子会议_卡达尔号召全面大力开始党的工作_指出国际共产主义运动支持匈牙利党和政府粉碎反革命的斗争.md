Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 30th. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party held a national activists' meeting on the 27th. Karoly Kiss, a member of the Provisional Executive Committee, delivered a report on the party's organizational situation and tasks at the meeting. Comrade Kadar then spoke as well.

    Constantly Arguing About Past Mistakes Will Hinder Party Building
    Comrade Kiss said: The organizational work of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has begun, but it is proceeding slowly and insufficiently resolutely. The activities of party members are still relatively weak, and the situation in the localities is better than in Budapest. The establishment of party organizations in enterprises is progressing slowly, because a clear and firm answer has not been given to the question of whether there should be party organizations in enterprises. This is undeniable for Communists, but some people do not like it. In the future, the work of party organizations in enterprises must change the working methods of the past, now that the situation has changed.
    Kiss pointed out that we should strive to win the support of the working class on the one hand, and strengthen the armed forces on the other.
    Kiss said that the situation in the countryside is stable, which will facilitate the work of rural party organizations. The main task now is to establish party organizations in mining areas and Budapest.
    Kiss criticized the phenomenon in party organizations of constantly arguing about who did what and what mistakes were made in the past, which hinders party building work.

  　We Should See the Counter-Revolution's Attempt to Establish a Source of War in Hungary
    After analyzing the domestic economic situation, Kiss said: How can our party become the leading force in the country? It is that Communists must be the strongest fighters, as they have been in the past, and should be even more so in the future.

    Kadar said in his speech: The international communist movement supports the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the government's struggle to crush the counter-revolution, and supports the actions of the Soviet Union. The communist parties of all countries have a consistent assessment of the most fundamental issues in the Hungarian situation. However, in the United Nations, the imperialists are exerting great pressure on the Hungarian delegation and all those who support our cause. Kadar said that the Soviet army took action at the request of the legitimate government, in accordance with treaties concluded in many respects and approved by the parliament. The Soviet action prevented the formation of a dangerous hotbed of war. The countries surrounding Hungary, bordering Hungary, have all been under Hungarian jurisdiction for longer or shorter periods in the past. If the counter-revolution were to win, they would use their own proposals to revise borders to carry out war provocations and establish a source of war. We should not only see the counter-revolutionary forces in Hungary, but also see a large army of 15,000 people in the West, composed of former gendarmes and officers, which was then ready to enter Hungary.

  　Those Who List the Immediate Withdrawal of Soviet Troops as the Primary Demand Are Objectively Supporting the Counter-Revolution
    Kadar then talked about several domestic issues. He said that anyone who lists the immediate withdrawal of Soviet troops as the primary demand is objectively supporting the counter-revolution. We have tried this path, which led to the massacre of innocent people and the revival of representatives of the old world of landlords. In this case, so-called neutrality would turn into joining the Atlantic Alliance, and there would be American military bases and American troops on Hungarian territory, and finally complete loss of independence. We think that the order of things should be reversed. We should first defeat the counter-revolution militarily and politically, and consolidate the people's power. When all this has been achieved, the Hungarian government and the Soviet government can then begin negotiations on the withdrawal of Soviet troops. This is the real revolutionary path, and this is the path to Hungarian independence.

    Kadar talked about the issue of expanding the government. He said, our position on this issue is very clear. After order is consolidated, we are very willing to negotiate with those who sincerely want to cooperate with us on the basis of people's democracy and socialism.

  　The Work of the Workers' Councils Should Be Developed in a Good Direction
    Kadar then talked about the issue of workers' councils. He said that the workers' councils basically play a positive role. Through the loyal members of the workers' councils (who make up the majority), the activities of the councils will gradually turn to their real task, to the economic issues of the factory. The party should be concerned about the staff of the workers' councils, and their work should be developed in a good direction.

    Kadar also talked about the so-called Nagy issue. He said that in the current situation, it is not right to bring wavering and compromise into the leadership.

    Kadar finally said that the party's activities are now needed as much as bread is needed by a hungry person. The state of instability should be ended, and the party's work should be started in all places with all our strength.

    匈社会主义工人党举行全国积极分子会议
　　卡达尔号召全面大力开始党的工作
　　指出国际共产主义运动支持匈牙利党和政府粉碎反革命的斗争
    新华社布达佩斯30日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党27日召开了党的全国积极分子会议。临时执行委员会委员卡罗利·基什在会上作了关于组织党的情况和党的任务的报告，卡达尔同志接着也发了言。
　  不断争论过去的错误会妨碍党的建设
    基什同志说：匈牙利社会主义工人党的组织工作开始了，但是进行得缓慢和不够坚决。党员的活动还比较薄弱，地方上的情况要比布达佩斯好些。在企业中建立党组织的工作进行得较慢，其原因是由于在企业中是否应有党组织的问题，尚未给予明确、坚定的答复。这件事对于共产党人来说是无可争辩的，但是有些人却不喜欢它。今后在企业中党组织的工作，在已经改变了的情况下，要改变过去的那种工作方法。
    基什指出，我们一方面应努力争取工人阶级的支持，另一方面要加强武装力量。
    基什说，农村的情况是稳定的，这将便利于农村党组织的工作。现在主要的任务是要建立矿区和布达佩斯的党组织。
    基什批评了党组织中那种不断争论过去几年内谁作了什么、有什么错误等妨碍建党工作的现象。
  　应该看到反革命在匈牙利建立战争策源地的企图
    在分析了国内的经济情况后，基什说：我们的党怎样才可以成为国家的领导力量呢？就是要共产党人是最坚强的战士，过去是这样，今后更应该是这样。
    卡达尔在发言中说：国际共产主义运动支持匈牙利社会主义工人党和政府粉碎反革命的斗争，并且赞成苏联的行动。各国共产党对匈牙利形势的最根本问题的估价是一致的。但是在联合国内，帝国主义者对匈牙利代表团及一切支持我国事业的人却在施加很大的压力。卡达尔说，苏军是根据多方面缔结的并经国会批准了的条约、在合法政府要求下，才采取行动的。苏联的行动阻止了一个危险的战争温床的形成。匈牙利四周围的国家同匈牙利接壤的部分，过去都曾经在或长或短的时期内属于匈牙利管辖。如果反革命胜利了，他们便会用自己的修改疆界的主张去进行战争挑衅，建立战争策源地。我们不要只看到匈牙利的反革命力量，还要看到在西方的一支由过去的宪兵、军官组成的一万五千人的大军，它当时已经准备好开进匈牙利来。
  　把立即撤退苏军列为首要要求的人，客观上是在支持反革命
    卡达尔接着谈到了几个国内问题。他说，凡是把立即撤退苏军列为首要要求的人，客观上就是在支持反革命。我们曾经试验过这条道路，它导向对无辜的人的屠杀和旧的老爷世界的代表们的复活。在这种情况下，所谓中立会变成参加大西洋联盟，在匈牙利领土上会有美国军事基地和美国军队，最后就会完全丧失独立。我们想，应该把事情的先后次序倒过来。应该先在武装上和政治上打败反革命，巩固人民政权。当这一切实现了以后，匈牙利政府和苏联政府再开始谈判苏军撤退问题。这才是真正的革命道路，这才是匈牙利独立的道路。
    卡达尔谈到了扩大政府的问题。他说，我们在这个问题上的主张是很明白的。等秩序巩固后，我们很愿同那些真心要在人民民主和社会主义的基础上同我们合作的人谈判。
  　应使工人委员会的工作向好的方向发展
    卡达尔接着谈到工人委员会问题，他说，工人委员会基本上是起着积极作用的。通过工人委员会中忠诚的委员们（这些人占大多数），委员会的活动将会日渐转向它的真正任务，转向工厂经济问题。党应该过问工人委员会的工作人员，应使他们的工作向好的方向发展。
    卡达尔还谈到了所谓纳吉问题。他说，在目前的形势下，把动摇和妥协带到领导中来是不正确的。
    卡达尔最后说，现在需要党的活动就如同饥饿的人需要面包一样。应当结束不安定状态，用全部力量在一切地方开始党的工作。
