Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 21st: Premier Zhou Enlai answered questions from Burmese and foreign reporters at the airport on the morning of the 20th before leaving Rangoon.

    A reporter asked: To what extent has the Sino-Burmese border issue been resolved during Your Excellency's visit to Rangoon?

    Premier Zhou replied: A joint statement was signed this morning (20th) and will be published soon. Our views are basically close. We are resolving this issue based on historical documents. Please see my farewell speech for my impressions of my visit to Burma.

    Reporter asked: Did you discuss the possibility of holding a second Bandung Conference during your stay in Rangoon?

    Premier Zhou replied: This issue was not touched upon. Prime Minister Nehru told me in India about the recent Colombo Powers Conference.

    A reporter asked: Regarding the border issue, are you satisfied with your visit to Rangoon?

    Premier Zhou replied: The main purpose of my visit this time was not for the border issue, but a friendly visit, because Chairman U Nu had already discussed the border issue with us in Beijing in November of this year. Since my previous two visits to Burma were too short, I hope to meet more Burmese friends during this friendly visit. This friendly visit will also promote the resolution of the Sino-Burmese border issue.

    A reporter asked: Have you encountered any additional difficulties in the border issues that have already been discussed? Premier Zhou replied: No. The reporter then asked: Can the Sino-Burmese border issue be resolved peacefully? Premier Zhou replied: Of course, it can be resolved peacefully. How could two countries like us not resolve it peacefully?

    Premier Zhou asked the reporter: Are you a reporter for a British newspaper? The reporter replied: Yes. Premier Zhou then said: I tell you, all these problems were left over by Britain, problems caused when British colonialism occupied Burma and oppressed China.

    在仰光机场
    周总理答记者问
    新华社仰光21日电　周恩来总理20日上午在离开仰光前，在机场答复了缅甸和外国记者提出的问题。
    一个记者问：阁下在仰光访问期间，中缅边界问题解决到何种程度？
    周总理答：今天（20日）上午签订了一个联合声明不久即将发表。我们的观点基本上是接近的。我们是根据历史上的文件来解决这一问题的。关于我的访缅感想请看我的告别词。
    记者问：你在仰光期间有没有谈到举行第二次万隆会议的可能性？
    周总理答：没有接触这个问题。尼赫鲁总理曾在印度告诉我关于最近举行的一次科伦坡国家会议的情况。
    一个记者问：就边界问题而言，你对于在仰光的访问是否满意？
    周总理答：我这次访问主要的并不是为了边界问题，而是友好访问，因为吴努主席今年11月间在北京已经同我们讨论了边界问题。由于我过去两次访缅的时间太短，因此我希望在这次友好访问中能够会见更多的缅甸朋友。这次友好访问也会促进中缅边界问题的解决。
    一个记者问道：在已经讨论的边界问题中是否遭遇到什么额外的困难？周总理答：没有。这个记者接着又问：中缅边界问题是能够和平地解决吗？周总理回答说：当然可以和平解决，像我们这样的两个国家怎么不能和平解决。
    周总理问这个记者：你是英国报纸的记者吗？记者答：是。周总理接着说：我告诉你，所有这些问题都是英国遗留下来的，是英国殖民主义占领缅甸时、也是它对中国进行压迫的时候所造成的问题。
