    Construction Begins on the Chuanxi Cement Plant
    (Our dispatch) Construction has begun on the Chuanxi Cement Plant, one of China's largest cement plants, near the Majiaoba station of the Baocheng Railway at the foot of Jianmen Mountain.
    The scale of the Chuanxi Cement Plant is equivalent to the newly built Datong Cement Plant. It is scheduled to be completed in 1959. After it is put into production, its annual output will be more than twice that of Chongqing Cement Plant, currently the largest in Sichuan. The factory area is close to the Baocheng Railway, making the transportation of raw materials and products very convenient. (Liu Zhongxing)

    川西水泥厂动工
    本报讯　我国最大水泥厂之一的川西水泥厂已在剑门山麓宝成铁路马角坝车站附近施工。
    川西水泥厂的规模与新建的大同水泥厂相等，计划在1959年建成，投入生产后，年产量将比目前四川最大的重庆水泥厂大两倍多。这个厂的厂区紧靠宝成铁路，原料和产品的运输都很方便。　（刘忠兴）
