The city of Reggio Emilia has several things to be proud of: it is the birthplace of the great Italian poet Ariosto; it was here that the tricolor flag first appeared in the uprising of 1797; and among its current 400,000 residents, there are 70,000 Communist Party members, making it the reddest city in all of Italy. But its greatest honor is the heroic Cervi family, residing in the nearby rural community of Campegine.

On the morning of April 23rd, we took a train from the northern Italian industrial city of Milan to Emilia. Comrade Rinanto Nicolai, the author of "My Seven Sons," accompanied us and recounted the Cervi family's circumstances and the deeds of the seven sons en route.

The father of the seven sons, Alcide Cervi, is now a prosperous farmer who, although eighty years old, still works in the fields. He once worked as a long-term hired hand for agricultural capitalists, living on the top floor, which leaked rain on cloudy days and was uninhabitable, but the capitalist refused to repair it. He drilled holes in the floor so the rainwater would flow down, and only then did the capitalist repair the leaky roof. During the Boxer Rebellion in China, he was conscripted into the army. He believed this was an unjust war and deserted. The mother was educated and often recited Hugo's "Les Misérables" to the whole family. This undoubtedly had a good influence on her sons. The eldest son, Gelindo, was his father's best assistant in agricultural labor. The second son, Antante, was taciturn. The third son, Aldo, was strong-willed and later became a heroic guerrilla leader. The fourth son, Ferdinando, was quiet and diligent. The fifth son, Agostino, was the most active. The sixth son, Avidio, was somewhat headstrong. The seventh son, Ettore, was the family's darling, a bit mischievous, and loved playing hide-and-seek. They were a hardworking and happy farming family.

While Aldo was serving in the military, he was imprisoned for disobeying orders and met some Communist Party members in prison. They made him aware of the truth of Marxism. Among the seven brothers, he was the first to join the Italian Communist Party. Returning to his hometown, he opened a small library and privately passed around books such as "Das Kapital," Gorky's "Mother," and Jack London's "The Iron Heel," and propagated communism. Many young people in his hometown and others in his family also joined the anti-fascist struggle. They began to be persecuted by the fascists, and the group they had formed was disbanded. But their activities did not stop. They studied advanced methods to improve agricultural production and held exhibitions using small tractors, globes, etc. – promoting scientific knowledge – to inspire the farmers' struggle.

Mussolini began his fascist reactionary rule in 1922. Gelindo had opposed the war of aggression against Ethiopia. The Mussolini government, violating the people's will and interests, dragged Italy into World War II. Under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party, Aldo and his brothers and friends distributed the Party's "Unità" and anti-fascist leaflets. The whole family cooperated in printing the leaflets, sometimes printing as many as 10,000 a day!

In 1943, Mussolini fell. The Cervi family treated the farmers in the village to pasta in the square to celebrate. But they knew that the arduous struggle still lay ahead and did not let down their guard. Sure enough, Hitler's troops entered Italy, and the fascist bandits became rampant again. Aldo and his brothers and friends seized weapons from the German army and launched a patriotic guerrilla war in this quiet region, just like in other parts of Italy. The Cervi brothers not only participated in the fighting but also supplied the guerrilla fighters with bread and dairy products, sometimes having to disguise the dairy cows as sick to deceive the enemy. Many prisoners of war from concentration camps, from countries such as England, America, Austria, and the Soviet Union, were sheltered and cared for by the Cervi family. They also guided the prisoners of war across the front lines or into the guerrilla areas in the mountains. They sheltered and transported more than eighty prisoners of war of different nationalities. Not long ago, the Soviet newspaper "Komsomolskaya Pravda" also published an article about Soviet prisoners of war seeking refuge.

On a rainy, dark night in November 1943, one hundred and fifty fascist soldiers surrounded the Cervi home. In addition to the eight Cervi father and sons, there were seven guerrilla fighters in the house. They put up a heroic resistance, and only after using up their meager supply of bullets were they captured and imprisoned, suffering extreme torture. In prison, the father and sons were separated. The fascist bandits told the seven sons that if they surrendered and joined the fascist army, they could avoid death. Gelindo's words represented their unanimous sentiment: "You can kill us, but we will never die!" They calmly met their end in Reggio Emilia. In the moment before his death, Aldo bequeathed his new clothes to his beloved son. His last words were: "Our cause will surely triumph!"

The news of the simultaneous martyrdom of the seven heroic brothers immediately spread throughout Italy. Guerrilla units everywhere organized Cervi fighting groups, vowing to continue their cause and avenge the fascist bandits.

The father, imprisoned in another location, did not know that his seven sons were no longer alive. It was not until the Allied forces bombed down the prison walls that he and the others escaped. The mother already knew the news but temporarily concealed it from the old man, repaying his comfort with comfort. The father finally heard rumors, but showed remarkable fortitude. He said that a person's death is like the changing of the seasons, and excessive sorrow is unnecessary. He cheered up, engaged in production, and repaired the house, wanting to bury the grief deep in the hearts of the whole family with diligent and intense labor. The fascist bandits were unwilling to let go and came to set fire to the Cervi home again. The mother recalled the circumstances of her sons' arrest, was heartbroken, and soon passed away.

Two hours passed imperceptibly. Comrade Nicolai told us that we had arrived in Reggio Emilia.

We went to the Italy-USSR Friendship Association in Emilia to rest. The friends at the association gave us a very warm reception. A small exhibition room displayed many pictures and drawings depicting China's economic construction. Rongbaozhai's reproductions of Qi Baishi and other painters' works were highly treasured by them. They also hoped to hear Chinese music, but unfortunately, we did not bring any records. The short contact made us deeply feel: these comrades' interest in Chinese affairs is very strong. The warm atmosphere made us feel at home.

After sitting for a while, we took a car to visit the father of the seven heroes, the elderly Alcide Cervi. Comrade Anita Skiati personally drove the car, speeding along the smooth road. Losanna Ferrari was as cheerful as a lark, always singing or laughing in a clear voice. On both sides of the road were green meadows, and orchards and vineyards grew in patches, the scenery was very beautiful.

Half an hour later, our car stopped by the roadside. An old man was cutting feed for dairy cows in the meadow – a type of green grass with flowers that resembled rapeseed flowers. Comrade Nicolai waved to him, and he walked up to us with steady steps, hesitantly extending his soil-stained hand to shake ours. Of medium build, with a face tanned red and black by the sun, and bright eyes, one could immediately tell that he was a strong and humorous person. This was the old hero we admired, Alcide Cervi. He smiled and led us to his home.

We said that the Chinese people already knew about the heroic Cervi family, and we came specifically to pay our respects. The illustrious name of the deceased not only lives in the hearts of the Italian people but will also live forever in the hearts of the Chinese people. He looked at us with a smile and nodded slightly. We presented him with a painting of peaches by Qi Baishi and explained that it was to wish him a long life. He looked at Comrade Nicolai and said, "I wish to live another eighty years, do you think that's possible?" We all laughed and said that his working habits and health could guarantee the realization of his hope. His eyes shone with joyful light as he looked at the painting again carefully.

He led us to see the pigs, cows, and crops he raised. The cowshed was full of Dutch dairy cows. He walked up to the largest cow and called out "Peter!" The cow immediately stood up in response. It was evident that he had worked here for a long time, and even the cows were familiar with his voice. He was very experienced in growing crops. He said that grafting tomatoes onto potatoes tasted very good. He said that when he visited the Soviet Union, he discussed agricultural production experience with Khrushchev, and Khrushchev agreed with his views.

Leaving the cowshed, we arrived at the bright passage connected to it. Comrade Nicolai told me that the seven sons were arrested here, and as he spoke, he tapped the ground with his foot where they had stood. We then talked about the past, about their arrest and the situation in prison. Old Man Cervi paced back and forth a little faster. Afraid that he would be sad, we offered gentle consolation and changed the subject. But he said in a very firm tone that fascism must not be allowed to revive, and there must be no more wars of aggression! If there was a situation like the past again, he would still devote himself to the struggle, just as before, at any cost! His words represented the will of the Italian people.

Lunch was approaching, and we returned to the house, which was adjacent to the passage, where we had originally sat. Several of his daughters-in-law and grandchildren were already in the house, and he introduced them to us one by one. The daughters-in-law were all healthy farm women, and the grandchildren were still young. He joked with his daughters-in-law and often stroked his grandchildren's heads.

We sat down, and his daughters-in-law set up a sumptuous lunch. The tablecloth was very white and very strong. The old man said that it was woven by his wife and had been used for thirty-three years. He also recalled his own mother, saying that she also plowed the fields and wove cloth, working hard all her life; his mother often said that those who weave cloth have no clothes to wear, and those who don't weave cloth can't wear them. The old man sighed and said, "After two or three generations, the situation in Italy has not changed."

Comrade Nicolai told us that the day before, five hundred teenagers from all over Italy had paid their respects to the old man, and young people across the country respectfully call him Papa Cervi. We said that the young people in China would also respect him in the same way. He laughed loudly and said, "Then I have a lot of children!" Then he pointed to the smiling Losanna Ferrari and said:

"This daughter likes to be slim and doesn't dare to eat too much;" pointing to Qi Zonghua, he said: "This daughter is newly acquainted, and is still a bit too polite!" We all laughed.

Comrades Nicolai and Ferrari then began to recount anecdotes from Old Man Cervi's visit to the Soviet Union, which made him laugh incessantly. He lived in a sanatorium, and one day, he went out without telling anyone, causing forty people to search everywhere. It turned out that he was in a secluded place, telling stories to a group of children while gesturing! He didn't want to ride in a car and always liked to ride a bicycle or walk without wearing leather shoes.

The Italian people highly respect Old Man Cervi and have given him many gifts to express their respect, including a gold medal presented to him by the people of the whole country, inscribed with the immortal names of his seven heroic sons. Togliatti inscribed on a photograph he gave him: "To Comrade Cervi, the father of the sacrificed warriors." The local people elected him as a district administrative committee member, and on grand festivals such as May Day, they often invited him to give a speech at the guerrilla cemetery, a place that the people consider the most sacred, to express their remembrance of the dead and their encouragement to the living. In the hearts of the Italian people, Old Man Cervi and his seven heroic sons are the embodiment of the bravery and honor of the working masses. "My Seven Sons," dictated by the old man and written by Comrade Nicolai, has been printed in one million copies, which fully demonstrates the Italian people's respect and love for them.

After lunch, he gave us photographs of his seven sons. They are not only the pride of the Italian people but also the pride of the people of the world! – "You can kill us, but we will never die!" – "Our cause will surely triumph!" On the way back, I seemed to hear their heroic last words echoing across the Italian sky.

　　七个英雄儿子的父亲
　　——访阿尔契德·契尔维——
    李霁野
    里吉阿·爱密里亚这个城市，有几件事可以自豪：它是意大利大诗人亚里阿斯托的生地；1797年这里首先起义，出现三色旗；在现在的四十万居民中，有七万共产党员，是全意大利最红的城市。但是它的最大的荣耀，是住在附近农村克木皮金的英雄的契尔维家庭。
    4月23日早晨，我们从意大利北部工业大城市米兰坐火车到爱密里亚去。陪我们前去的里南托·尼古来同志是笔述“我的七个儿子”的作者，他在途中向我们叙述了契尔维家的情况和七个儿子的事迹。
    七个儿子的父亲阿尔契德·契尔维现在是一个富裕的农民，虽然年已八十，还在田地里劳动。他曾经为农业资本家作过长工，住在顶楼上面，阴天漏雨，不堪居住，可是资本家不肯修理。他在地板上钻了洞，雨水流下去，资本家才把漏雨的屋顶修了。在中国义和团起义时，他曾被征入伍。他认为这是不正义的战争，就从军队里逃跑了。母亲是有文化的，常为全家朗诵雨果的“悲惨世界”。这无疑地对她的儿子们有很好的影响。长子杰林多，在农业劳动中是父亲最好的助手。次子安坦特里沉默寡言。三子阿尔多意志坚强，以后成为英勇的游击队领袖。四子菲第南多安静勤劳。五子阿戈司亭诺最为活跃。六子阿维狄阿稍显顽强。七子爱陶里为全家所宠爱，他有些调皮，爱玩捉迷藏等游戏。他们家是一个勤劳幸福的农民家庭。
    阿尔多在服兵役的时候，因为不服从命令而入狱，在狱中结识了一些共产党员。他们使他认识了马克思主义的真理。在七兄弟中，他首先加入了意大利共产党。回到故乡，他开了一个小小的图书馆，私下传递“资本论”、高尔基的“母亲”和杰克·伦敦的“铁蹄”等书，并宣传共产主义。他的故乡的许多青年和他家的其他人也加入了反法西斯的斗争。他们开始受到法西斯的迫害，他们所成立的小组被解散了。但是他们的活动并没有停止。他们学习先进的方法改进农业生产，并用小型拖拉机、地球仪等举行展览会——宣传科学知识——以鼓舞农民的斗争。
    墨索里尼在1922年开始法西斯的反动统治，杰林多曾经反对过侵略埃塞俄比亚的战争。墨索里尼政府违反着人民的志愿和利益，把意大利拖入了第二次世界大战。在意共的领导下，阿尔多和他的兄弟朋友们散发党的“团结报”和反法西斯的传单。他们全家合作印发的传单，有时一天有一万张之多！
    1943年，墨索里尼垮台了。契尔维家在广场上请村里的农民们吃面庆祝。但是他们知道，艰苦的斗争还在前面，并没有放松警惕。果然，希特勒的军队开进了意大利，法西斯匪帮又猖狂起来了。阿尔多和他的兄弟朋友们夺取了德军的武器，在这个安静的地区，也像意大利其他各地方一样，发动了爱国的游击战争。契尔维兄弟不仅参加战斗，并且用面包和乳品供给游击战士，有时不得不把乳牛伪装成病牛，遮掩敌人的耳目。许多从集中营逃出的英、美、奥、苏等国的战俘，得到了契尔维家的掩护和照拂。他们还指导战俘们穿过前线或进入山里的游击地区。被他们掩护输送的战俘有不同国籍的八十多人。不久前，苏联“共青团真理报”还刊载苏联战俘避难的记事。
    1943年11月一个阴雨的深夜，一百五十个法西斯兵士将契尔维家包围了。除了契尔维父子八人之外，家里还有七个游击战士。他们进行了英勇的抵抗，把不多的子弹打完后，才被捕入狱，并受尽了苦刑。在狱中，父亲和儿子们是隔离开的。法西斯匪徒告诉七个儿子说，假如他们投降加入法西斯军队，可以不死。杰林多的话代表了他们一致的心意：“你们可以杀害我们，但是我们永远也死不了！”他们从容地在里吉阿·爱密里亚就了义。死前一刹那，阿尔多还将他自己的新衣服遗赠给他的爱子。他的最后遗言是：“我们的事业一定胜利！”
    七个兄弟英雄同时就义的消息立刻传遍了全意大利，各地的游击队纷纷组织契尔维战斗团，起誓继续他们的事业，并向法西斯匪徒讨还血债。
    关在另一处监狱里的父亲，还不知道七个儿子都已经不在人间。直到盟军将监狱的墙炸毁，他和其他人才逃出来了。母亲已经知道消息了，可是还暂时隐瞒着老人，用安慰报答他的安慰。父亲终于听到了风声，但却表现了惊人的坚定。他说，人的死亡，犹如季节的更换，过分的悲伤是不必要的。他振作起来，从事生产，修理房屋，想用辛勤紧张的劳动，埋葬深藏在全家人心里的悲哀。法西斯匪徒还不肯放手，又来纵火焚烧契尔维家的房屋。母亲回想起儿子们被捕时情况，心痛欲绝，不久就逝世了。
    两小时的时间不觉过去了。尼古来同志告诉我们说，我们已经到了里吉阿·爱密里亚了。
    我们到爱密里亚的意苏友好协会去休息。协会的朋友们给了我们非常热情的接待。一个不大的展览室里，陈列着不少表现中国经济建设的图片和画页。荣宝斋复印的齐白石和其他画家的画，很被他们珍爱。他们也很希望听到中国的音乐，可惜我们没有带唱片。短短的接触就使我们深深的觉得：这些同志对中国事物的兴趣是十分浓厚的。亲切的气氛使我们感到宾主如归。
    坐不一会我们就乘汽车，去访问七个英雄的父亲阿尔契德·契尔维老人。安妮塔·司奇阿蒂同志亲自开着车在平坦的道路上飞驰。洛山娜·费拉莉像云雀一样欢快，总是歌唱着，或用清脆的声音笑语。道路两旁是绿草如茵的草原，果树和葡萄树一片一片的生长着，风景十分秀丽。
    半点钟后，我们的车在道旁停住了。草场上一个老人正在割乳牛的饲料——一种开着油菜花似的花的青草。尼古来同志向他招手致意，他用稳健的步子走到我们跟前来，有些迟疑的伸出带有泥土的手来和我们握手。中等身材，被太阳晒得红黑的面孔，两眼有神，一下就可以看出他是一个坚强而又有幽默感的人。这就是我们所崇敬的老英雄阿尔契德·契尔维。他微笑着领我们到他家里去。
    我们说，中国人民已经知道了英雄的契尔维家庭，我们特来致敬。死者的英名不仅在意大利人民的心里，也将在中国人民的心里永远活着。他含笑看着我们，微微地点点头。我们把齐白石画的一幅桃送给他，并说明这表示祝他长寿。他看了看尼古来同志，说道，我愿再活八十年，你看行不行？我们都笑了，并说他的劳动习惯和健康情况都可以保证他的希望实现。他的眼睛里闪耀着快乐的光辉，把画又细看了一番。
    他领我们去看他养的猪、牛和农作物。牛房里都是荷兰种的乳牛。他走到最大的一头牛跟前，叫了一声“彼得！”牛便应声站起来了。可见他在这里劳动日久，牛连他的声音都熟悉了。他对种庄稼很有经验，他说用土豆接蕃茄味道非常好。他说，他访问苏联时，曾和赫鲁晓夫谈农业生产经验，赫鲁晓夫很同意他的意见。
    出了牛房，我们到了和它相连的开朗的过道间。尼古来同志告诉我说，七个儿子就是在这里被捕的，说着他还用脚点点他们所站的地方。我们因此就谈到了往事，谈到了他们被捕和在狱中的情况。契尔维老人脚步稍快一些踱来踱去，我们怕他伤心，便婉言安慰，并转变话题。他却用很坚定的口气说，决不准法西斯复活，决不准再有侵略战争！万一再有以往那样情况，他还要同以前一样不惜任何牺牲，投入斗争！他的话代表了意大利人民的意志。
    将要午餐了，我们回到原先坐的和过道间毗连的房子。他的儿媳和孙子已有好几个人在屋里了，他一一为我们介绍。儿媳都是健康的农妇，孙子都还幼小。他和儿媳谈笑，时时抚摸孙子的头。
      我们就坐，他的儿媳开上丰盛的午餐。桌布很洁白，并且很结实，老人说这是他的妻子纺织的，已经用了三十三个年头了。他又回忆到他自己的母亲，说她也是耕田织布，一生勤苦；他的母亲常说，织布的没有衣服穿，不织布的衣服穿不了。老人叹息说，过了两三代，意大利的情形并没有改变呵。
    尼古来同志告诉我们说，前一天有五百个从意大利各地来的青少年向老人致敬，全国的青少年都尊称他为契尔维爸爸。我们说，中国的青少年也会同样尊敬他。他大笑说道，那我的儿女可真多了！接着他指着笑眯眯的洛山娜·费拉莉说：
  “这个女儿爱苗条，不敢多吃；”指着齐宗华说：“这个女儿新认识，还有点太客气！”说得我们都笑了。
    尼古来和费拉莉同志接着就叙述起契尔维老人访问苏联时的趣事，引得他自己也大笑不止。他住在疗养院里，一天，不给人知道就走出去了，害得四十个人四外寻找，原来他在一个僻静的地方，正打着手势为一群孩子说故事！他不愿坐汽车，总欢喜骑脚踏车外出，或者不穿皮鞋步行。
    意大利人民极为尊敬契尔维老人，送给他许多表示敬意的礼物，其中有全国人民献给他的金章，上面刻着七个英雄儿子的不朽名字。陶里亚蒂在赠送给他的照相上题着：赠给牺牲了的战士们的父亲契尔维同志。当地人民选他作区行政委员，在盛大的节日如“五一”节，常请他在游击战士公墓这个人民认为最神圣的地方发表演说，表示对死者的怀念，对生者的鼓舞。在意大利人民的心目中，契尔维老人和他的七个英雄儿子是劳动大众的英勇和荣誉的化身。老人口述，尼古来同志笔书的
  “我的七个儿子”已经印行了一百万册，也充分表现意大利人民对于他们的崇敬和热爱。
    午饭后，他把七个儿子的照相赠送给我们。他们不仅是意大利人民的，也是全世界人民的骄傲！——“你们可以杀害我们，但是我们永远也死不了！”——“我们的事业一定胜利！”在归途中，我仿佛听到他们的英勇的遗言响彻了意大利的天空。
