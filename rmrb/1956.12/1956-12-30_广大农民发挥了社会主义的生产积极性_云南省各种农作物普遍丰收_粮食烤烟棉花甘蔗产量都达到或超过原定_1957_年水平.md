    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Kunming, December 29th) Yunnan Province has achieved a universal bumper harvest of various farm crops this year. According to recent estimates by the Provincial Planning Commission, the total output of grain crops, flue-cured tobacco, cotton, and sugarcane in the province this year has already reached and exceeded the originally planned levels for the final year of the First Five-Year Plan.
    The total output of grain crops (major and minor harvests) in the province this year reached 12,415 million jin, an increase of 15.78% over last year, exceeding the state plan by 9.2%; the planting area for grain crops this year totaled 45,787,700 mu, also exceeding the state plan. In terms of technical crops, the total output of flue-cured tobacco reached 152.85 million jin, an increase of 264.69% over last year, exceeding the state plan by 109.38%; the province planted a total of 1,100,500 mu of flue-cured tobacco, an increase of 309.6% over last year. The total output of cotton (upland cotton) this year reached 10.68 million jin, an increase of 83.64% over last year, exceeding the state plan by 61.81%; the planting area was 397,100 mu, also exceeding the state plan and increasing over last year. The total output of sugarcane this year reached 1,261.52 million jin, an increase of 29.13% over last year, exceeding the state plan by 2.88%; the planting area totaled 197,400 mu, an increase of 14.79% over last year. In addition, tea production is expected to increase by 17% compared to last year, and silkworm cocoons can increase by 45%. In other areas, the afforestation area in the province this year has greatly exceeded the state plan, and the survival rate is higher than in previous years, averaging about 70%. The irrigated area has been expanded by 3,720,000 mu this year, exceeding the total area expanded in the previous three years and also exceeding this year's state plan by 220,000 mu. The animal husbandry industry failed to complete the plan this year; except for sheep, which exceeded the breeding plan, the breeding plans for cattle, horses, and pigs were not completed.
    This year, Yunnan Province, on the basis of the cooperative movement and inspired by the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)," brought into play the socialist enthusiasm and production zeal of the broad masses of peasants, deeply carried out a mass agricultural production movement, and achieved such production increase results. With the universal increase in production of various crops throughout the province, more than 85% of agricultural cooperative members have increased their income compared to last year. Currently, the broad masses of peasants in most parts of the province have launched winter production activities, striving to continue to achieve significant production increases next year.

    本报昆明29日电　云南省今年种植的各种农作物普遍丰收。据省计划委员会最近预计，全省今年粮食作物和烤烟、棉花、甘蔗的总产量，已经分别达到和超过第一个五年计划最后一年原定的水平。
    今年全省粮食作物（大、小春）的总产量共达一百二十四亿一千五百万斤，比去年增产15.78％，超额9.2％完成国家计划；粮食作物种植面积今年共为四千五百七十八万七千亩，也超额完成国家计划。在技术作物方面，烤烟的总产量达到一亿五千二百八十五万斤，比去年增加264.69％，超额109.38％完成国家计划；全省共种植烤烟一百一十万五千亩，比去年增加309.6％。棉花（草棉）的总产量今年达到一千零六十八万斤，比去年增加83.64％，超额61.81％完成国家计划；种植面积为三十九万七千一百亩，也超额完成国家计划和比去年增加。甘蔗总产量今年达到十二亿六千一百五十二万斤，比去年增加29.13％，超额2.88％完成国家计划；种植面积共为十九万七千四百亩，比去年增加14.79％。此外，茶叶可比去年增产17％，蚕茧可增产45％。在其他方面，今年全省造林面积已经大大超过国家计划，成活率高于往年，平均达到70％左右。水利灌溉面积，今年扩大三百七十二万亩，超过前三年扩大面积的总和，比今年国家计划也增加二十二万亩。畜牧业今年未能完成计划；除羊超额完成增殖计划外，牛、马、猪增殖计划都没有完成。
    云南省今年是在合作化运动的基础上，在“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”的鼓舞下，发挥了广大农民的社会主义积极性和生产热情，深入开展群众性的农业生产运动，取得了这样的增产成绩。随着全省各种作物的普遍增产，有85％以上的农业社社员比去年增加了收入。现在，全省大部分地区的广大农民已展开冬季生产活动，为继续争取明年显著增产而努力。
