Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 5th: According to a report in "Neues Deutschland" on the 4th, the Saar Communist Party issued a statement on December 2nd condemning the Saar Treaty signed by France and West Germany, which merges the Saar with West Germany from January 1st of next year. The statement pointed out that this treaty is merely a transaction based on purely military considerations reached between the monopoly capitalists of France and West Germany.

The statement then made suggestions regarding the Saar issue: The Saar should implement a policy that conforms to the interests of all Germany and promotes the reunification of the two Germanys; the Saar government, the Saar parliament, and all parties and organizations in the Saar should demand that the two German governments not use force to resolve the German question, and demand that they support the plan to establish a European collective security system and abolish compulsory military service.

The Saar Communist Party also sent letters to the government of the German Democratic Republic and the People's Chamber. The letter stated that the proposal put forward by the German Democratic Republic for resolving the Saar issue is a contribution to easing tensions in Germany. It conforms to the interests of all the German people.
