Xinhua News Agency, December 11th. The All-China Women's Federation held the Third National Women and Children's Welfare Work Conference in Beijing from December 1st to 11th.

    This conference focused on discussing issues such as rural women's labor protection, protecting children's safety and health, and childcare organizations. A total of 147 representatives from local women's federations and relevant departments attended the meeting.

    The conference believes that at present, the primary task of women's federations at all levels is to assist relevant departments in doing a good job in rural women's labor protection while mobilizing women to participate in production. The conference pointed out that since the high tide of agricultural cooperativization across the country, the vast number of rural women have actively participated in labor production. However, when mobilizing women to participate in production, women's federations have not paid enough attention to taking care of women's physiological characteristics. At the same time, because women lack knowledge of maternal and child health, in the great production of last winter and this spring, there were serious accidents in many places, such as women suffering miscarriages, premature births, and menstrual disorders due to participating in unsuitable labor, and some even died or were injured.

    The conference pointed out that rural women's labor protection is a meticulous and long-term task, which is related to the transformation of feudal remnants and old customs. Therefore, women's federations at all levels must conduct in-depth publicity and education to male and female farmers and agricultural cooperative cadres, change the views of some members and cadres who do not attach importance to women's safety in production and who despise or discriminate against women, and establish a new moral atmosphere of respecting and protecting women. At the same time, it is necessary to promote agricultural cooperatives to reasonably arrange women's labor force according to local labor habits, different seasons, women's physical strength, technical level, and the complexity of household chores. In rural areas, it is also necessary to further carry out publicity work on new methods of delivery and maternal and child health knowledge, and include it as an important part of women's labor protection work.

    The conference pointed out that women's federations at all levels should also widely publicize knowledge about protecting children's safety and health and raising children, and establish a new social atmosphere of caring for children. In rural areas, in addition to universally publicizing the importance of protecting children's safety and health to the vast number of male and female farmers, it is also necessary to adopt a variety of methods based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit to solve the problem of women participating in production when no one is taking care of their children. In cities, childcare work should be done well. In the future, in addition to promoting industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, schools, and other units to organize various simple and flexible childcare organizations, it is also necessary to continue to mobilize the masses to develop street-based mass childcare organizations.

    The conference pointed out that the issue of educating children is an arduous, long-term, and meticulous task, and women's federations at all levels should take it as an important part of their daily work. In the future, it is necessary to widely publicize the importance of this work to the masses, and to cooperate with relevant departments and social forces to educate parents and all adults in society about new morals, so that they can set an example and influence children. At the same time, special attention should be paid to using various opportunities to introduce methods of raising children to the masses, promote the experience of the masses, and commend and select model parents, so as to establish learning role models among the masses. In addition, it is also necessary to advocate mutual supervision and mutual assistance between families, between women, and between neighbors in order to establish a new atmosphere of caring for and educating children.

    第三次妇女儿童福利工作会议
    讨论保护农村妇女劳动安全
    并决定广泛宣传保护和教养儿童的知识
    新华社11日讯　中华全国民主妇女联合会1日到11日在北京举行第三次妇女儿童福利工作会议。
    这次会议着重讨论了农村妇女劳动保护、保护儿童安全和健康以及托儿组织等工作。参加会议的有各地妇联代表和有关部门的代表共一百四十七人。
    会议认为，目前各地妇联首先必须在发动妇女参加生产时，重视协助有关部门做好农村妇女劳动保护工作。会议指出，自从全国农业合作化高潮以来，各地广大农村妇女积极参加了劳动生产，但是妇联组织在发动妇女参加生产时，没有很好注意照顾妇女生理特点；同时由于妇女缺乏妇婴卫生知识，因此在去冬今春大生产中，有不少地方的妇女因参加不适宜的劳动而流产、早产、得月经病，有的甚至死伤等严重事故。
    会议指出，农村妇女劳动保护是一件细致的、长期的工作，关系到对封建残余思想和旧习俗的改造问题。因此各地妇联必须深入地向男女农民和农业社的干部进行宣传教育，改变某些社员和干部不重视妇女在生产中的安全以及轻视或歧视妇女的观点，树立尊重和保护妇女的新道德风气。同时要推动农业社根据当地劳动习惯、不同季节、妇女的体力强弱、技术高低、家务简繁等不同情况来合理安排妇女劳动力。在农村中，还要进一步开展新法接生和妇婴卫生知识宣传工作，并且把它列为妇女劳动保护工作的一项重要内容。
    会议指出，各地妇联还应广泛宣传保护儿童安全健康和育儿知识，在社会上树立爱护儿童的新风气。在农村除了向广大男女农民普遍宣传保护儿童安全和健康的重要性外，还必须根据自愿互利原则，采用多种多样办法，解决妇女参加生产时孩子无人照管的问题。在城市中应做好托儿工作，今后除了推动工矿企业、机关、学校等单位来举办各种简便灵活的托儿组织外，还要继续发动群众开展街道群众性的托儿组织。
    会议指出，教养子女问题是一项艰巨、长期而细致的工作，各地妇联应把它作为日常工作中的一项重要内容。今后要广泛向群众宣传这一工作的重要意义，要配合有关部门和社会力量向父母和社会上一切成人进行新道德的教育，使他们以身作则，影响儿童。同时要特别注意利用各种机会向群众介绍教养子女的方法，推广群众的经验，并且表扬、评选模范父母，在群众中树立学习的榜样。另外，还要提倡家庭之间、妇女之间、邻里之间互相督促，互相帮助，以树立关怀教养子女的新风气。
