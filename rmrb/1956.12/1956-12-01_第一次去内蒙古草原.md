　　First Time on the Inner Mongolia Grassland
　　Zhao Yongxi
    I had only been in Hailar for a week when, around 9 PM on August 21st, a comrade rushed over to tell me: The Hulunbuir League People's Hospital had just received a telegram from a herdsman near the Ganjur Temple in New Barag Left Banner, reporting a critically ill patient and requesting the hospital to send a doctor for emergency treatment. The League Hospital's ambulance was ready and about to depart. Ganjur Temple is about 200 kilometers away and they'd have to return tomorrow. He asked if I wanted to see the grassland. Transportation on the grassland is inconvenient, so this was a rare opportunity to go, and I gladly went along.

    The ambulance crossed the bridge over the Yimin River at a speed of over 30 kilometers per hour, turning south from the brightly lit city center of Hailar and driving into the vast, dark grassland.

    The flat grassland originally had no obvious roads. Looking ahead in the glare of the headlights, I could only see some faint traces of wheels. It had been raining a lot these past few days, and there was standing water on several sections of the road. As the ambulance turned, the road disappeared. But the driver didn't hesitate at all, driving straight ahead. I asked the nurse: Can we avoid getting lost driving like this? The nurse said the driver was a Mongolian, who grew up on the grasslands and was very familiar with the roads here. It turned out my worries were unnecessary.

    We often encountered herds of cattle and horses on the road. Many agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams were practicing night grazing in order to fatten up their livestock for the autumn. This was uncommon before mutual aid and cooperation because there weren't enough laborers. One or two people would be exhausted after a day of grazing, making night grazing impossible. After mutual aid and cooperation, labor was unified and allocated by the cooperative and team, allowing for black and white shifts to alternate.

    The ambulance was driving too fast and unfortunately caused an accident midway. About 100 kilometers out, a herd of horses flashed in front of the headlights. When the horses first saw the ambulance lights, they froze, but as the ambulance approached, they panicked, jostling and bumping into each other. As a result, the rear of a fat horse got caught on the large iron hook on the front of the ambulance. The driver quickly stopped the car and got out to try and pry the horse's thigh off the hook, but the horse turned around and bit the driver's thigh. Seeing this, no one else dared to approach. What to do? Just then, the Mongolian girl herding the horses rode over. Calmly, she looked, then raised her lasso pole and aimed it at the horse's head. The horse kicked forward with all its might, broke free from the hook, and ran off. The driver apologized to the Mongolian girl, but she didn't say a word of blame, only asking the driver to wait a moment before driving on, as the horses were startled and she needed to gather them first. With that, she galloped into the darkness.

    After the ambulance drove away, we sat in the car and talked. Everyone admired the Mongolian girl's composure. As for what to do about the horse's injury? The Mongolian comrades all said that the injury wasn't serious and would heal quickly. They said that the herdsmen had many livestock, and they wouldn't be concerned even if they lost one or two horses, it wasn't a big deal. Hearing this, I felt that it was a bit of an exaggeration, but it was indeed the case—the Mongolian girl did not make things difficult for us.

    Before dawn, around 3 AM, the ambulance pulled up to a yurt. The driver went down and asked the people sleeping in the yurt where the patient was. They replied that the patient was at the banner hospital. Around 4 AM, the ambulance stopped, and when I got out, I saw that the "banner hospital" was also four or five yurts. Dr. Feng Yong of the League Hospital told me that the banner hospital often moved with the herdsmen.

    The doctor at the banner hospital led us to the yurt where the patient was staying. A candle was lit inside the yurt, and a portrait of Chairman Mao hung on the front wall. The patient was a young woman, lying unconscious on a felt mat. Through a translator, the young herdsman who had escorted the woman for treatment told me: The patient's name was Yan Jima, and she was in the same agricultural production mutual aid team as him. Yan Jima worked very hard and didn't want to rest even when she wasn't feeling well. She insisted on going out for "Aoter" (nomadic grazing) a few days before she fell ill. She fell unconscious on the fourth day after becoming sick. Her husband had gone to graze "Aoter" far away and hadn't returned yet.

    Using a flashlight, the nurse shone light while the doctor repeatedly listened and tapped on the patient's chest and abdomen. The preliminary diagnosis was pleurisy, as well as bladder urine retention. Her condition was very serious and she needed to be taken back to the hospital for treatment immediately. The young herdsman escorting the patient, upon hearing that the patient had to be taken to Hailar, was worried about the patient being jolted in the car, so he rode out on horseback to borrow a felt mat.

    By this time, it was already dawn. We ducked out of the yurt and gazed at the grassland. The boundless grassland was connected to the horizon, resembling the sea. The clouds in the sky seemed to fly very low. There were some white yurts nearby, with dogs guarding the entrances. The herdsmen had not yet gotten up. A herd of cattle lay on the grass chewing their cud, while the Nele birds chirped "Nele, Nele" in the grass.

  “The sky is vast, the wilderness boundless, the wind blows the grass low, revealing cattle and sheep.” Only by personally seeing the grassland can one truly appreciate the meaning encapsulated in this poem.

    When the ambulance returned, the sun had already risen from the eastern side of the grassland. Groups of cattle, horses, and sheep were all moving towards the sun, some going to the water's edge to drink, others raising their heads and neighing. Herdsmen rode on horseback singing pastoral songs. They liked to draw out the notes when they sang, their voices loud and clear, carrying far. Indeed, the people of the grassland sang songs that were so full of grassland color.

    We arrived back in Hailar at 1 PM on the 22nd. Having been jostled by the ambulance all night without sleep, I was still very excited. Perhaps, I had fallen in love with this grassland. (Attached photo)

### 第一次去内蒙古草原

　　第一次去内蒙古草原
　　赵永西
    我来海拉尔刚一个星期，8月21日晚上九点来钟，一个同志匆忙跑来告诉我：呼伦贝尔盟人民医院刚接到新巴尔虎左旗甘珠尔庙附近一个牧民打来的电报，有急病患者，请医院派医生去抢救，盟医院的救护车已经准备好，就要出发了。甘珠尔庙离这儿有二百来公里，得明天返回来。他问我是不是要去看看草原。草原上交通不便，难得遇到这样好机会走一趟，我欣然地跟着去了。
    救护车用每小时三十多公里的速度穿过伊敏河上的大桥，从灯火辉煌的海拉尔市中心往南拐，开进黑茫茫的草原。
    平坦的草原上本来没有什么明显的道路。我从车灯光亮里往前看，只能看见一些车轮的轻微痕迹。前些天多雨，有几段道路有积水，救护车一拐，道路就不见了。可是司机却一点也不犹豫，径直往前开。我问护士：这样走不能迷失吗？护士说司机是蒙古人，在草地上长大的，对这里的道路很熟悉。原来我的耽心是多余的。
    路上常常碰见牛马群。不少牧业生产合作社和牧业互助组，为了把牲畜秋膘抓好，都实行夜间放牧。这种情况在互助合作以前是不多的。因为那时劳动力不够，一两个人放牧一天就够累了，不可能实行夜间放牧。互助合作后，劳动力由社、组统一调配，黑白班可以替换。
    救护车开的太猛，不慎在中途闯了一次祸。大约走出一百多里路，车灯前面闪出一群马。这些马刚看见救护车灯光时都发楞不躲，等到救护车走到跟前就慌了，互相乱挤乱撞，结果有一匹肥马的臀部被救护车前面大铁钩挂住了。司机急忙停车，下车去掀马大腿，这匹马回头就照着司机的大腿咬了一口。看见这情形，别人谁也不敢再靠前。怎么办呢？正在这时候，放马的蒙古姑娘骑着马过来了。她不慌不忙，看了看，便举起套马杆子往马头上一照量，这匹马猛力往前一蹬，脱钩后撒腿就跑了。司机向蒙古姑娘道歉，她没有一句责难，只要求司机等一会儿开车，因为马惊了，她要先去把马收拢收拢。说完话，她便纵马跑进黑暗里去了。
    救护车开走后，我们坐在车上谈论起来。大家对这个蒙古姑娘的沉着，都非常敬佩。至于马受的伤怎么办？蒙古族同志都说这一点伤不要紧，很快就会好的。他们说，牧民的牲畜很多，即使损失一两匹马，也不在乎，算不了一回事。我听了，总觉得这话未免有些夸张，但这确是事实——蒙古族姑娘并没有留难我们。
    天还没有亮，大约是早晨三点多钟，救护车开到一个蒙古包跟前。司机走下去，向睡在蒙古包里的人打听病人在哪里，蒙古包里回答说在旗卫生院。四点来钟，救护车停下了，我下车一看，“旗卫生院”原来也是四、五个蒙古包。盟医院冯勇大夫告诉我：旗卫生院经常跟着牧民流动。
    旗卫生院的医士把我们领到病人住的蒙古包里。包里点着蜡烛，正面挂着毛主席像。患者是一个青年妇女，躺在毡垫上，已经昏迷不醒。通过翻译，护送这个妇女来治病的青年牧民告诉我：病人叫阎吉玛，同他在一个牧业生产互助组里。阎吉玛劳动很好，身体不舒服，还不肯休息，病倒的前几天还坚持出去走“敖特尔”（游牧）。病倒后的第四天就昏迷过去了。她的丈夫到远处走“敖特尔”去了，还没有回来。
    护士用手电筒照着，大夫在病人胸部腹部反复听敲，初步诊断是胸膜炎，还有膀胱储尿症，病情很严重，需要马上带回医院治疗。护送这个病人的青年牧民听说要把病人送到海拉尔去，怕病人在车上受振动，便骑马出去借毡垫。
    这个时候，天已经亮了。我们低头钻出蒙古包，了望草原。无际的草原和天边相连，简直像大海。空中的云彩也似乎飞得很低。附近有一些白色的蒙古包，狗守在包门口，牧民们还没有起来。一群牛躺在草地上倒嚼（反刍），讷勒鸟在草丛里“讷勒”，“讷勒”地叫着。
  “天苍苍，野茫茫，风吹草低见牛羊”，只有亲身到草地看看，才能体会这首诗所概括的意境。
    救护车回返时，太阳已经从草地东边升起来了。一群群牛、马、羊都向着太阳走动，有的到水边喝水，有的昂首嘶叫。牧民骑在马上唱牧歌。他们唱歌喜欢拉长音，声音宏亮，传得很远。到底是草原上的人们，唱起歌来也那么富有草原色彩。
    回到海拉尔已经是22日下午一时。被救护车颠簸一夜没睡觉，可是精神却很振奋。也许，我爱上了这个草原。（附图片）
