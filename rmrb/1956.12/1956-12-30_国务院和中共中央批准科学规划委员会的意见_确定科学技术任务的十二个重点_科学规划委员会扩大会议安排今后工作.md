Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: The State Council's Science Planning Commission held its third enlarged meeting in Beijing today. Present were Vice Chairman Guo Moruo, committee members, and over seventy scientists. The meeting heard a work report from the commission and arranged its future work.

The meeting was presided over by Vice Premier of the State Council, Nie Rongzhen. Nie Rongzhen put forward two instructions for future scientific research work. He said: The Academy of Sciences, universities, and industrial departments must strengthen cooperation. The content of cooperation should not only focus on the allocation of research tasks and the exchange of research experience, but also on full cooperation in personnel, books, and equipment. Through cooperation, we must gradually organize and consolidate and improve the scientific teams in all aspects. Secondly, we must promote a spirit of diligence and thrift in conducting science. Carrying out scientific research work requires various necessary material conditions. Generally speaking, our material conditions are not abundant, and we must gradually and selectively address them. However, we must use these conditions most economically and effectively, and prevent and oppose extravagance and waste.

The meeting heard work reports from Commissioners Fan Changjiang, Zhang Jingfu, and Qian Sanqiang. Commissioner Fan Changjiang conveyed the conclusions of the second enlarged meeting of the Planning Commission, which had been approved by the State Council and the CCP Central Committee. That meeting considered it appropriate to synthesize twelve key areas from the fifty-seven major scientific and technological tasks, based on the principle of "focusing on development and catching up." These twelve key areas are: peaceful utilization of atomic energy, new technologies in radio electronics (ultra-high frequency technology, semiconductors, electronic computers, electronic instruments, etc.), jet technology, automation of production processes and precision instruments, exploration of oil and other particularly scarce resources, exploration and determination of mineral raw material bases, establishing alloy systems and seeking new metallurgical processes in light of China's resource situation, comprehensive utilization of fuels and development of heavy organic synthesis, new types of power machinery and large machinery, major scientific and technological problems in the comprehensive development of the Yellow River and Yangtze River, major scientific problems in the chemicalization, mechanization, and electrification of agriculture, prevention and elimination of several major diseases that pose the greatest harm to the health of the Chinese people, and several important basic theoretical problems in natural science. These key areas cannot be advanced in parallel, but must be arranged according to their importance and urgency.

The State Council Science Planning Commission has decided to become a permanent institution. Its main tasks are: 1. Supervise the implementation of the science plan, especially the implementation of key tasks; 2. Initially summarize and balance the annual and long-term scientific research plans of various systems as part of the national plan; 3. Solve major coordination problems in scientific research work in various systems; 4. Study and organize the solution of important working conditions problems in scientific research work (such as books, materials, instruments, basic construction, etc.); 5. Uniformly arrange international cooperation issues in scientific research work.

At the meeting, Commissioner Zhang Jingfu also reported on the implementation of various emergency measures proposed in the draft outline of the plan. The preparatory committees for the four research institutions of electronics, computing technology, automation, and semiconductors have been established in the third quarter of this year, and are now actively training cadres, carrying out basic construction, and sending scientists abroad for inspection. The Scientific Information Institute has been established and has initially started work. Commissioner Qian Sanqiang reported on the content of the peaceful utilization of atomic energy research plan and the preparation work for the application of radioactive isotopes, and introduced the situation of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow, comprising twelve countries.

The meeting also discussed the compilation of the 1957 scientific research plan. It was decided that on the basis of the twelve-year scientific and technological development perspective plan and the plans of various departments, the 1957 annual plan should be basically compiled by the end of January 1957.

The revised draft of the 1956-1967 Scientific and Technological Development Perspective Plan Outline has been distributed to the members of the Planning Commission, various government departments, and various provinces and cities for comments. It is expected that the opinions of all parties will be concentrated by the end of January next year for final revision, and then formally submitted to the State Council and the CCP Central Committee for approval.

    国务院和中共中央批准科学规划委员会的意见
    确定科学技术任务的十二个重点
    科学规划委员会扩大会议安排今后工作
    新华社29日讯　国务院科学规划委员会今日在京举行第三次扩大会议，出席副主任郭沫若、各委员及科学家七十余人，会议听取了委员会的工作报告，并安排了今后的工作。
    会议由国务院副总理聂荣臻主持。聂荣臻对今后的科学研究工作提出了两点指示。他说：科学院、高等学校和产业部门之间要加强协作，协作的内容不仅应注意研究任务的分配和研究经验的交流，还要在人员和图书设备等方面充分协作。要通过协作，把各方面的科学队伍逐步组织起来，并且加以整顿和提高。其次，要提倡勤俭办科学的风气。开展科学研究工作，需要各种必要的物质条件，总的说来，我们的物质条件是不充裕的，必须逐步地有重点地加以解决，但我们必须最经济最有效地使用这些条件，防止和反对铺张浪费的作风。
    会议听取了范长江、张劲夫、钱三强三委员的工作报告。范长江委员传达了已经国务院和中共中央批准的规划委员会第二次扩大会议的结论。那次会议认为根据“重点发展、迎头赶上”的方针，从五十七项重大科学技术任务中综合提出十二个重点是适当的。这十二个重点是：原子能的和平利用，无线电电子学中的新技术（超高频技术、半导体、电子计算机、电子仪器等），喷气技术、生产过程自动化和精密仪器，石油及其他特别缺乏的资源勘探，矿物原料基地的探寻和确定，结合我国资源情况建立合金系统并寻求新的冶金过程，综合利用燃料和发展重有机合成，新型动力机械和大型机械，黄河、长江综合开发的重大科学技术问题，农业的化学化机械化电气化的重大科学问题，危害我国人民健康最大的几种主要疾病的防治和消灭，自然科学中若干重要的基本理论问题。对于这些重点，不可能是齐头并进，而是要根据轻重缓急，加以安排的。
    国务院科学规划委员会已决定成为常设的机构，它的主要任务是：一、监督科学规划的实施，特别是监督重点任务的实施；二、初步汇总、平衡各个系统年度的和长期的科学研究计划，作为国家计划的一部分；三、解决各个系统在科学研究工作中的重大协调问题；四、研究和组织解决科学研究工作中重要的工作条件问题（如图书、资料、仪器、基本建设等）；五、统一安排科学研究工作的国际合作问题。
    会上，张劲夫委员还报告了规划纲要草案中提出的各项紧急措施实施情况。电子学、计算技术、自动学、半导体四个研究机构的筹备委员会已在今年第三季度内成立，现在正在积极训练干部，进行基本建设和派遣科学家出国考察。科学情报所已经成立，并初步开展了工作。钱三强委员报告了和平利用原子能研究工作规划的内容和放射性同位素应用的准备工作，并且介绍了设在莫斯科的十二国联合核子研究所的情况。
    会议并讨论了编制1957年科学研究计划问题。决定在十二年科学技术远景规划和各部门的计划基础上，要求在1957年1月底前基本上把1957年年度计划编出来。
    1956—1967年科学技术发展远景规划纲要的修正草案已经分发给规划委员会各委员、政府各部门和各省市征求意见。预定明年1月底集中各方面意见，作最后的修正，然后正式报请国务院和中共中央批准。
