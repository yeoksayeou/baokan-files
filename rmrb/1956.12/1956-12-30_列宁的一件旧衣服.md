    Lenin's Old Clothes
    Yī Dīng
    In the early winter of the year before last, I had the opportunity to visit the Lenin Museum in Moscow. Many of the exhibits in this museum reflected Lenin's great deeds in his life, and also reflected his hard and simple life. We saw many things used by Lenin in his diet and daily life, such as clothes, shoes, hats, stationery..., all of which were ordinary things. I especially remember Lenin's old clothes, which were placed in a glass cabinet. At that time, many people surrounded the glass cabinet, their faces were unusually excited and serious, and an old lady was wiping away tears.
    This old clothes was simply an ordinary worker's clothes, the material was very rough, although it was cleaned up neatly, but it could be seen that it was already very old when Lenin wore it. The translator pointed to the patches with red thread on the clothes and said: "This is a bullet wound!" His voice was a little strange, he said that Lenin was wearing these clothes when he was shot and wounded in 1918. Lenin often wore these clothes before his death. ... When the translator said these words, I seemed to see the scene of Lenin being shot and wounded by the Socialist Revolutionary terrorist Kaplan in front of the former Mikhelson factory in the Henan Bank district of Moscow on August 30, 1918, and many scenes from the film "Lenin in 1918" flashed through my mind, and I shed tears.
    Lenin did the most and best work for all mankind, and contributed his entire life to the happiness of all mankind. However, when Lenin was alive, his life was so arduous and simple! Of course, a hard and simple life is just a little bit of his great life deeds, and this old clothes is just a small example of his hard and simple life.

    列宁的一件旧衣服
    一丁
    前年初冬，我有机会参观了莫斯科的列宁博物馆。这个博物馆的许多陈列品，反映了列宁生平的伟大事迹，也反映了他的艰苦朴素的生活。我们在那里看到了列宁饮食起居所用过的许多东西，如衣服、鞋子、帽子、文具……，都是平平常常的东西。我特别记得列宁的一件旧衣服，那衣服放在一个玻璃柜里。当时许多人围着这个玻璃柜，脸色都异常激动、严肃，有位老太太在擦着眼泪。
    这件旧衣服简直就是一件普通工人的衣服，料子很粗，虽然整理得干干净净，可是看得出列宁穿它时，它已经很旧了。翻译同志指着衣服上面缀有红线的补绽说：“这是一处枪伤！”他的声音有些异样了，他说，列宁在1918年被刺负伤的时候，就是穿着这件衣服的。列宁在逝世以前，还经常穿这件衣服。……翻译同志说这些话的时候，我仿佛看见了列宁在1918年8月30日在莫斯科河南岸区前米赫里逊工厂门前被社会革命党恐怖分子卡普兰开枪击伤的情景，我的脑海里闪过了“列宁在1918年”这部影片的许多镜头，我流泪了。
    列宁为全人类做了最多的、最好的工作，并且为了全人类的幸福贡献出了他的全部生命，然而，列宁活着的时候，他的生活是那样的艰苦朴素！当然，艰苦朴素的生活只不过是他伟大的生平事迹中的一点，这件旧衣服更不过是他艰苦朴素生活中的一个小例子。
