Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 4th (Reporter Fang Ling): The Tianjin Municipal People's Courts at all levels have made achievements in promoting five new judicial systems, including open trials, people's assessors, defense, collegial panels, and recusal. The achievements in labor reform are even more significant. Dr. Mei Ru'ao, a representative of the National People's Congress and a renowned legal scholar, said to reporters today after inspecting Tianjin's judicial work for twelve days: This is the most profound impression he has from this inspection.

Mei Ru'ao first talked about the achievements made by Tianjin in implementing the open trial system and the people's assessor system. He said that, except for cases involving state secrets, personal privacy, and juvenile delinquency, other cases were all tried openly. With the exception of simple civil cases and minor criminal cases, the assessor system was fully implemented. The court also encouraged parties to appeal and hire lawyers to defend themselves, which effectively safeguarded the legitimate rights of the parties.

"Tianjin's labor reform work is very successful," Mei Ru'ao said. "When I see those prisoners working and studying conscientiously, I hardly feel like this is a prison. Although there are no heavily guarded, armed guards and heavily locked prison doors as I have seen in prisons in capitalist countries, the staff who manage the prisoners do not feel any danger at all. Their relationship with the prisoners is, to some extent, like that of teachers and students."

Mei Ru'ao said: "The achievements of the labor reform policy that I saw in Tianjin can refute those who slander our country by using the Western definition of 'forced labor'." He said:

"In Western capitalist countries, making prisoners work is a form of corporal punishment, the purpose of which is to cause physical and mental pain to the prisoners. The purpose of our making prisoners work is to transform them into people who are useful to society. Prisoners can try to cultivate and develop their expertise in labor according to work needs, labor ability and personal interests."

Mei Ru'ao said: "In Tianjin Prison, I saw some prisoners who knew foreign languages engaged in translating children's books or science books, and some people who used to only steal have now learned to operate machines for production. They only work eight or nine hours a day, but their work level has improved rapidly. Those who are physically weak and a few prisoners who are unwilling to work are not forced to do so. Many prisoners are still very attached to the familiar management staff, machines, and work environment after serving their sentences. This year, 1,927 prisoners voluntarily stayed to work after serving their sentences, and they have now become workers and staff members. Some released prisoners often write letters to the prison to express their gratitude and report their achievements in their new jobs."

Mei Ru'ao said: "The prison staff respects the prisoners' personality and labor. Prisoners can receive material rewards and sentence reductions for new achievements in labor. Since the beginning of this year, prisoners have put forward more than 1,500 rationalization proposals in labor. Many people save the bonuses they receive and send them home, and their families are moved to tears, thanking the government for transforming their relatives into useful people." Mei Ru'ao said: "Judging from these circumstances, it is absolutely correct and very humane to carry out labor reform on prisoners."

When the reporter asked if there were any shortcomings in the Tianjin judicial organs' implementation of judicial policies and case trials, Mei Ru'ao said: "These cadres are diligent and law-abiding in implementing policies, but there are still deviations and errors in the trial of some cases. According to the Tianjin People's Courts at all levels' inspection of a batch of first-instance cases, 0.52% of the cases had misjudgments, and 1.43% of the cases were not judged appropriately, with more or less deviations, but these misjudgments and cases with deviations have now been corrected." Mei Ru'ao said: "Due to the low cultural and professional level of cadres, lack of experience, and the fact that there are few people and many things to do, coupled with the fact that our country does not yet have a complete criminal code, sentencing is very difficult, so errors are inevitable." Mei Ru'ao believes that one of the important ways to overcome these shortcomings is to more widely encourage and promote the defense and appeal systems. In addition, the work of the court to timely and actively inspect and reverse wrong judgments, and the training and education of lawyers and people's jurors must be greatly strengthened.

Mei Ru'ao inspected the courts, prisons, detention centers for untried offenders, juvenile delinquent correction centers, and labor reform units in Tianjin, listened to reports from public security, judicial, and procuratorial departments, attended several civil and criminal case trials, and studied several cases that had deviations in the trial. His inspection work in Tianjin ended today.

    全国人民代表大会代表、著名法学家梅汝璈
    谈在天津视察的观感
    印象最深的一点是：天津各级人民法院推行公开审判、人民陪审员、辩护、合议和回避等五种新的司法制度有成绩；劳动改造工作的成绩更为显著。
    新华社天津4日电　新华社记者方凌报道：天津市各级人民法院推行公开审判、人民陪审员、辩护、合议和回避等五种新的司法制度是有成绩的。劳动改造工作的成绩更为显著。全国人民代表大会代表、著名的法学家梅汝璈博士对天津的司法工作视察了十二天以后在今天对记者说：这是他在这次视察中印象最深的一点。
    梅汝璈首先谈到了天津市推行公开审判制和人民陪审员制所取得的成绩。他说，除了有关国家机密、个人隐私和少年犯罪的案件以外，其他的案件都作到了公开审判。除去简单的民事案件和轻微的刑事案件以外，全部执行了陪审员制度。法院还鼓励当事人上诉和聘请律师辩护，有力地保障了当事人的合法权利。
      “天津市的劳动改造工作是非常成功的。”梅汝璈说，“当我看到那些犯人在认真地工作和学习的时候，我简直感觉不到这是监狱。监狱里虽然没有像我在资本主义国家的监狱里所看到的那些戒备森严、荷枪实弹的看守人和重重深锁的牢门，但是管理犯人的工作人员一点也不感到危险，他们和犯人之间的关系，在某种程度上就像老师和学生一样。”
    梅汝璈说：“我在天津看到的劳动改造政策的成绩，可以驳斥那些用西方的‘强迫劳动’的定义来诬蔑我国的人们。”他说：
  “在西方资本主义国家中，让犯人去劳动就是体罚，目的是叫犯人的身心感到痛苦。而我们让犯人劳动的目的是把他改造成对社会有用的人。犯人可以根据工作需要、劳动能力和个人志趣在劳动中尽量培养和发挥自己的专长。”
    梅汝璈说：“在天津监狱中，我看到一些会外国文的犯人在从事儿童读物或科学书籍的翻译工作，一些原来只会偷窃的人现在学会了掌握机器进行生产。他们每天工作也不过八、九个小时，但工作水平提高得很快。对那些身体衰弱和少数不愿意劳动的犯人，也并不强迫他们去作。许多犯人刑满后还很留恋那些熟悉的管理人员、机器和工作的环境。今年就有一千九百二十七名犯人刑满后自动地留下来工作，他们现在已成为工人和职员。一些服刑期满被释放的犯人还常常给监狱来信表示感谢，并报告他们在新的工作岗位上的成绩。”
    梅汝璈说：“监狱中的工作人员很尊重犯人的人格和劳动，犯人在劳动中有了新的成就可以受到物质奖励和减刑。今年以来犯人们在劳动中提出一千五百多项合理化建议。许多人把得到的奖金节省下来寄回家去，他们的家人因此感动得流泪，感谢政府把他们的亲人改造成有用的人。”梅汝璈说：“从这些情况来看，对犯人进行劳动改造是绝对正确的，也是非常人道的。”
    当记者问起天津市司法机关在执行司法政策和案件审理中还有什么缺点时，梅汝璈说：“这些干部在执行政策方面，是勤勤恳恳、奉公守法的，但在审理某些案件上也还有偏差和错误。根据天津市各级人民法院对一批一审案件的检查，其中曾有0.52％件案件有错判现象，有1.43％件案件判的不尽恰当，而带有或多或少的偏差，但是现在这些错判和判决有偏差的案件已经得到纠正。”梅汝璈说：“由于干部的文化和业务水平不高、经验不足，而且人少事多，加之我国还没有一个完备的刑法典，量刑是很困难的，因此发生错误是不可避免的。”梅汝璈认为克服这些缺点的重要方法之一，是更广泛地鼓励和推行辩护和上诉制度。此外，法院及时主动地检查和改判错判案件的工作、律师和人民陪审员的培养教育工作都必须大大加强。
    梅汝璈在天津视察了法院、监狱、未决犯看守所、少年犯管教所和劳动改造单位，听了公安、司法、检察等部门的汇报，旁听了几个民事和刑事案件的审判，还研究了几个在审判中曾经出过偏差的案件。他在天津的视察工作已在今天结束。
