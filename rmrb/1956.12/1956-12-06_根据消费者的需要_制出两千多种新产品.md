　　Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, December 5th: Since the beginning of this year, nine local state-owned light industrial factories, including the Dalian Enamel Factory, have successfully trial-produced more than two thousand new products, exceeding the original annual plan by three times.

　　In the process of trial-producing new products, these factories have paid close attention to the interests and needs of consumers. This summer, the Lüda Canned Food General Factory produced many new varieties according to the tastes of local people, such as chicken patties, scallion and meat pastries, and glutinous rice cakes. These products were in short supply. Many kinds of women's winter clothing and embroidered shirts trial-produced by the Dalian Garment Factory have also become popular commodities for women to purchase.

　　Many new products trial-produced this year, in addition to having the characteristics of being strong and durable, have also undergone great improvements in terms of artistic patterns, styling, and decoration. The new woven pattern products produced by the Dalian Enamel Factory, whether in monochrome or multicolor, are exquisite and were welcomed at the national enamel product supply conference.

    根据消费者的需要
　  制出两千多种新产品
    新华社旅大5日电　大连搪瓷厂等九个地方国营轻工业工厂今年以来试制成功两千多种新产品，超过原订全年计划的三倍。
      这些工厂在试制新产品过程中，都很注意消费者的兴趣和需要。旅大罐头食品总厂在今年夏天根据当地人们的口味生产了鸡肉饼、葱肉酥、糯米凉糕等许多新品种，这些产品都供不应求。大连被服厂试制的很多种女冬装和绣花衬衣，也都成了妇女们喜欢选购的商品。
    今年试制的许多新产品，除了具有坚固耐用的特点以外，在美术图案、造型、装璜等方面也都有很大的改进。大连搪瓷厂新出产的编制图案制品，不论单色或套色都很精美，在全国搪瓷品供应会议上受到了欢迎。
