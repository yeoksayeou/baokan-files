This Year's British Santa Claus
　　Gao Zhi

The British soldiers in Port Said, hearing the news of the withdrawal, cheered happily, patted each other on the shoulders, and shouted "Going home for Christmas," even losing their appetite for dinner.

Eden, having rested, is not afraid of fatigue and has returned home to "deal with difficulties," and of course, he will also celebrate Christmas.

The British are going to celebrate Christmas. But this year, this joyous holiday cannot bring any joy to the British people, and the British people who welcome Santa Claus are not smiling, but frowning.

The war of aggression has brought economic crisis to the British Empire. Production has shrunk. Inventories have decreased. Imports have decreased. Prices have soared.

Automobile production has been cut by a third, and gasoline prices have risen by a third. Shipping costs have increased. Raw sugar prices have increased. Tea prices have increased. Wool prices have increased. Except for Eden's prestige, which has repeatedly depreciated, everything else has increased in price.

The war of aggression has created a batch of new ghosts for the British Empire. What will Santa Claus bring to those orphans and widows? What else can those widows and orphans use to welcome Santa Claus besides tears and cries?

The war of aggression has increased the number of unemployed people and shortened working hours for the British Empire. What will Santa Claus bring to those unemployed workers? What else can those unemployed and semi-employed workers, their wives, and children use to welcome Santa Claus besides resentment and curses?

The war of aggression has brought countless difficulties to the daily lives of all British people. What will Santa Claus bring to those families without new ghosts or unemployment? Facing soaring prices, what else can the broad masses of British people use to welcome Santa Claus besides complaining and grumbling?

In the past, many years ago, the bag of gifts that Santa Claus brought to Britain was full. The contents of the bag were the money and blood and sweat of the people in overseas colonies and semi-colonies. While British gentlemen were comfortably sitting in front of colorful Christmas trees smoking pipes, poor laborers overseas were panting from the heat under the shade of tropical trees.

This year, Santa Claus's bag, like the British people's money bags, is not bulging, but shriveled. Although Santa Claus's bag is shriveled, it still contains some documents.

These documents are the condemnation of the British launching a war of aggression by people all over the world who uphold justice and love peace, the United Nations resolution requiring Britain to stop the aggression and withdraw from Egypt, and this opinion from a Chinese person:

"For many years, Britain has welcomed American troops to spend Christmas in Britain, which is Britain's freedom. Egypt will never welcome British troops to spend Christmas in Egypt, which is Egypt's freedom. Britain has no reason to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty and freedom."

The British Santa Claus's gift bag is shriveled. But the American Santa Claus's bag is bulging. In the American Santa Claus's bag, the first gift is the huge profits for the American oil capitalists.

Eden may have dreamed that the American Santa Claus would give him some leftover gifts. But whether it is the British Santa Claus or the American Santa Claus, they can only watch oil prices rise, but cannot make Eden's prestige and the aging empire's prestige rise.

    今年的英国圣诞老人
    高植
    在塞得港的英国士兵，听到撤军的消息，高兴地欢呼，互相拍肩膀，高喊着“回家过圣诞节”，甚至连晚饭也没有心思吃了。
    艾登休息已罢，不怕疲劳，回国“应付困难”，当然也要过圣诞节了。
    英国人要过圣诞节了。但是今年这个欢乐的节日，却不能带给英国人民什么欢乐，而迎接圣诞老人的英国人民，也不是喜笑颜开，却是愁眉苦脸了。
    侵略战争给大英帝国带来了经济危机。生产萎缩了。存货减少了。进口货物减少了。物价飞涨了。
    汽车的产量削减三分之一，汽油的价格涨了三分之一。轮船的运费上涨了。粗糖的价格上涨了。茶叶涨价了。羊毛涨价了。除了艾登的威望一再跌价而外，什么都涨价了。
    侵略战争给大英帝国制造了一批新鬼。圣诞老人会带点什么给那些孤儿寡妇呢？那些寡妇孤儿，除了用眼泪和哭声，能用什么别的迎接圣诞老人呢？
    侵略战争给大英帝国增加了许多失业的人和缩短工作的人。圣诞老人会带点什么给那些失业的工人呢？那些失业的、半失业的工人，和他们的妻室儿女，除了用怨恨和咒诅，能用什么别的迎接圣诞老人呢？
    侵略战争给全体英国人民的日常生活上带来了数不尽的困难。圣诞老人会带点什么给那些没有新鬼、没有失业的人家呢？广大的英国人民，面对飞涨的物价，除了用诉苦和埋怨，还能用什么别的迎接圣诞老人呢？
    从前，许多年前，圣诞老人带给英国的礼物袋子是满满的。袋子里的东西是海外殖民地和半殖民地的人民的金钱和血汗。当英国绅士们安乐地坐在五光十色的圣诞树前抽烟斗的时候，海外的穷苦劳工正在热带的树荫下热得喘不过气来。
    今年，圣诞老人的袋子，却像英国人民的钱袋一样，不是臌臌的，而是瘪瘪的了。圣诞老人的袋子虽然是瘪瘪的，里面却还有些文件。
    这些文件是全世界维护正义、爱好和平的人士对于英国发动侵略战争的谴责，联合国要英国停止侵略并从埃及撤军的决议，还有一个中国人的这点意见：
    “英国这许多年来欢迎美国军队在英国过圣诞节，这是英国的自由。埃及决不欢迎英国军队在埃及过圣诞节，这是埃及的自由。英国没有任何理由侵犯埃及的主权和自由。”
    英国圣诞老人的礼物袋子是瘪瘪的。但是美国圣诞老人的袋子却是臌臌的。在美国圣诞老人的袋子里，头一件礼物是给美国石油资本家的巨大利润。
    艾登也许梦见了美国圣诞老人给他一点剩余的礼物。但英国的圣诞老人也罢，美国的圣诞老人也罢，都只能眼看石油涨价，却不能使艾登和衰老的帝国的威望涨价。
