　　Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 20th: The Cambodian Sangkum Reastr Niyum (People's Socialist Community) cabinet collectively resigned to the King on the 19th after the National Assembly refused to hold a vote of confidence in the cabinet.
    At the National Assembly meeting that began on the 17th, some members impeached Minister of Finance and Industrialization Huot Sambath and Secretary of State for Commerce Keo Sangkim, saying they were involved in privately transporting textiles to South Vietnam. On the morning of the 19th, the National Assembly held a vote of confidence on the two of them. Of the eighty members present, more than sixty voted no confidence.
    Prime Minister Sangkum Reastr Niyum had requested the National Assembly to hold a vote of confidence in the entire current cabinet, because he believed that the impeachment case was aimed at the entire cabinet. The National Assembly decided not to discuss the issue for the time being and adjourned the meeting. In order to show solidarity, the Sangkum Reastr Niyum cabinet decided to resign collectively.
    The Cambodian News Agency published a statement by Prince Sihanouk on the afternoon of the 19th. He believes that the fall of the current cabinet is abnormal.
    The statement said, should it be considered that the fall of the cabinet is the result of conspiracies by those who hope to climb into ministerial positions and those who hope to escape impending punishment?
    The statement believes that the fall of the Sangkum Reastr Niyum government will weaken Cambodia's international status, hinder the rapid development of the country, and benefit the enemies of Cambodia's sovereignty and neutrality.
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, December 21st: Prince Sihanouk suggested to the King of Cambodia last night that if the King approves the resignation of the current cabinet headed by Sangkum Reastr Niyum, Sangkum Reastr Niyum should be re-appointed to form a new cabinet.

    柬埔寨内阁总辞职
    西哈努克指责倒阁阴谋
    据新华社金边20日电　柬埔寨桑云内阁19日在国民议会拒绝对内阁进行信任投票之后，向国王提出了集体辞职。
    在17日开始的国民议会会议上，曾经有议员弹劾内阁财政计划和工业化大臣胡森阿和工商国务秘书科桑，说他们参与把纺织品私自运往南越。19日上午，国民议会对他们两人举行信任投票。在出席会议的八十名议员中，有六十多人投了不信任票。
    王国首相桑云曾经要求国民议会对现任内阁全体进行信任投票。因为他认为这项弹劾案是针对整个内阁的。国民议会决定暂时不讨论这个问题而宣告休会。桑云内阁为了表示团结一致，决定集体辞职。
    柬埔寨新闻社19日下午发表了西哈努克亲王的一项声明。他认为：目前内阁的垮台是不正常的。
    声明说，是不是应该认为：内阁的垮台是那些希望自己爬上大臣的职位的人和那些希望逃避即将遭受的惩处的人阴谋活动的结果呢？
    声明认为，桑云政府的垮台将会削弱柬埔寨的国际地位，阻碍国家的飞速发展，而有利于柬埔寨的主权和中立的敌人。
    据新华社金边21日电　西哈努克亲王昨天晚上向柬埔寨国王建议，如果国王一旦批准了以桑云为首的现任内阁的辞职，应该继续指定桑云出组新阁。
