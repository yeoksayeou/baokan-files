　Vltava River Basin
　　Will Build Eighty Reservoirs
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 3rd - According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency: The water conservancy project system in the Vltava River basin in western Czechoslovakia is being planned and constructed.

According to this water conservancy project plan, approximately eighty reservoirs will be built on the Vltava River, Malše River, Lužnice River, Otava River, Sázava River, and Berounka River in the Vltava River basin, with a total storage capacity of approximately 1.5 billion cubic meters. The largest reservoir will be the one at the Orlík lock, which is currently under construction.

Currently, two-thirds of this huge water conservancy system has been completed or is under construction. The completed projects include the Slapy and Štěchovice locks. In addition to the Orlík lock, the Lipno and Kamýk locks are also under construction.

It is estimated that after the completion of these reservoirs, the Vltava water conservancy project system will be able to save nearly 100,000 train carloads of coal each year, provide conditions for the development of various economic sectors in South Bohemia, and improve the climate of the region, making it more suitable for habitation.

　  捷弗尔塔瓦流域
　　将兴建八十个水库
    据新华社布拉格3日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道：捷克斯洛伐克西部弗尔塔瓦流域的水利工程系统正在筹划和建设中。
    根据这项水利工程计划，将在弗尔塔瓦流域的弗尔塔瓦河、马耳塞河、路兹尼策河、沃塔瓦河、萨扎瓦河和贝龙卡河上建筑大约八十个水库，总蓄水量将达十五亿立方公尺左右。最大的水库将是正在兴建中的奥利克水闸上的水库。
    目前这一巨大水利系统中有三分之二的工程已经建成和正在建设。已经建成的有斯拉皮、什捷霍维策等水闸，正在建造的除奥利克水闸外，还有利普诺、卡米克水闸。
    预计在建成这些水库以后，弗尔塔瓦水利工程系统每年将能够节约将近十万车皮的煤，为南波希米亚各经济部门的发展提供条件，并且能改善这个地区的气候，使它更适于居住。
