    From Twenty-Four Heads to Fifteen Thousand Heads
    ——A Record of Pig Raising in Shimen Song Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, Yanggu County, Shandong Province, Over the Past Few Years——
    Shimen Song Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yanggu County, Shandong Province, is a large cooperative with 2,740 households and 14,158 people, with more than 31,000 mu of land. This cooperative attaches great importance to the development of pig production. When it was first established in 1952, it had only 24 pigs. Now it has developed to more than 11,000 heads, and may reach 15,000 heads by the end of this year. The cooperative has not only increased its income from selling pigs, but more importantly, it has accumulated a large amount of fertilizer from raising pigs, thus increasing grain production year by year. In the past, this area only yielded more than 400 jin of grain per mu, but last year the cooperative harvested 1,009 jin per mu.
    The cooperative was established in 1952, with only 14 poor peasant households. The land in Yanggu County is not fertile. The locals call it "buying and selling land" - meaning that it is impossible to produce without fertilization, and that less fertilization means less grain, and more fertilization means more grain. In order to accumulate more fertilizer and produce more grain, these 14 poor peasant households decided that the cooperative should raise pigs. That year they raised 24 pigs, which were specially raised by one member. At the end of the year, they sold 18 fat pigs, and two sows had piglets. The cooperative still maintained 24 pigs. After deducting labor and feed costs, the net profit was more than 370 yuan, and more than 300 carts of pig manure were accumulated. Due to the abundant manure and fertilizer, coupled with deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, the yield per mu in that year was 670 jin of grain, while the average yield of individual farmers was only 400 jin of grain per mu.
    In 1953, they absorbed 48 new members. Most of the new members were wealthy households and were unwilling to raise more pigs. They believed that raising pigs was labor-intensive, requiring both the collection of feed and feeding at regular intervals, as well as pulling soil to pad the pens, which was too much trouble; they also said that pig manure was not as fertile as soybean cake. The leaders of the cooperative did not emphasize the benefits of raising more pigs, and bought soybean cake from the supply and marketing cooperative for fertilizer. This year, 630 mu of land were planted. In addition to buying human manure and chemical fertilizers, 60,000 jin of soybean cake were used, with an average cost of 11 or 12 yuan per mu, equivalent to 150 jin of coarse grains. As a result, although production increased, the grain distributed to the members was not much. Under these circumstances, 27 farmers withdrew from the cooperative.
    The cooperative summarized the work of this year and believed that the main reason for the low income was the high production cost, the excessive use of soybean cake and chemical fertilizers, and the neglect of pig raising, an important sideline.
    In 1954, only 35 households remained in the cooperative. They learned from past experiences and lessons and paid special attention to pig raising. A breeding committee was established to be responsible for the cooperative's pig production. They planned to raise 80 pigs this year, and made detailed plans for how many large pigs and how many small pigs the cooperative could raise, how much refined feed and how much roughage would be needed, and what kind of feed would be fed at what time. They also selected people who were willing to do breeding work and cherished public property to be breeders. In less than three months, the number of 80 pigs had been reached, and pig sales began in May of that year. The pigs they raised were sent to the purchasing station and were always rated as first and second class.
    Next, the cooperative mobilized the members to raise pigs in their own homes. Local farmers did not have the habit of raising pigs, and many members were unwilling to raise them. Poor households said they had no money to buy piglets, no money to build pens, no strength to pull soil to pad the pens, and no feed; general households considered whether the manure turned over to the cooperative would be paid for? How much would be paid? Was it cost-effective? More affluent households with more labor thought that they would never use up their work points anyway, so they didn't care whether they raised pigs or not. According to these three situations, the cooperative cadres went to mobilize them separately and helped the members overcome practical difficulties. The cooperative provided loans of piglets and pig vegetables to poor households, helped the members build pens and pull soil by exchanging labor, and the cooperative and the members signed contracts for pig manure to be turned over to the cooperative, stipulating reasonable prices and guaranteeing no change for one year. With such specific help, some households began to raise pigs. At first, only 17 pigs were privately raised; after June, the members who had not paid much attention to pig raising before saw that the pig-raising households really received money for pig manure, and the cooperative really helped solve problems, and that raising pigs was really beneficial, so they also bought pigs to raise. By the end of the year, the pigs privately raised by the members reached 70; the pigs publicly raised by the cooperative developed to 140.
    This year, the whole cooperative sold 105 fat pigs, and the grain yield per mu increased to 960 jin, and the members were generally satisfied. Twenty-four farmers who had withdrawn from the cooperative before requested to join the cooperative again.
    In 1955, this cooperative had 59 households and 306 people, and raised 360 pigs, averaging more than one pig per person. This year, they sold 185 pigs, and the money from selling pigs was equivalent to 27% of the total agricultural income. The whole cooperative had an average of one pig's fertilizer available for use every two mu of land. The grain yield per mu increased to 1,009 jin. The members clearly realized the benefits of raising pigs. They said: Raising pigs is the lifeline of the cooperative. If you want to improve your life, you must raise pigs.
    Yanggu County was not originally a pig-producing area, and farmers did not have the habit of raising pigs in every household and every year, but it is not a simple matter that the Shimen Song Township Agricultural Cooperative can develop to the point where the members have an average of one pig per person. Many areas feel that it is difficult to obtain feed and cannot raise more pigs, but the state has not given this cooperative special treatment, yet they have raised so many pigs. What is the reason for this? In addition to the cooperative leaders' attention, organized and planned development of the pig-raising industry, and the members' feeling that raising pigs is beneficial and they are willing to raise more, the more important thing is that they can actively find ways to solve the feed problem.
    Before the unified purchase and sale of grain, the cooperative used a lot of refined feed to feed pigs, and everyone believed that they could not feed pigs without grain and vegetables, so the cost of raising pigs was very high. In 1953, the cooperative fed 72 pigs, most of which were fed refined feed. Each pig ate 450 jin of soybean cake, 150 jin of powder residue, and some sweet potato seedlings; in addition, they did not pay attention to feeding technology and epidemic prevention and hygiene, and as a result, each pig lost 1 yuan and 8 jiao including labor and materials.
    In the late spring of 1954, Shandong Province held a symposium on pig raising. At the meeting, it was proposed to use green fodder to ferment and feed pigs. Song Baoen, the deputy director of the cooperative, participated in this meeting and returned to the cooperative to conduct experiments. At first, the pigs didn't like to eat it, but after four or five days they liked it. After feeding for half a month, a summary was made: in the past, 470 jin to 500 jin of dried vegetables were used to feed pigs every day. After using fermented feed, 200 jin of dried vegetables could be saved every day, so more than 3 yuan could be saved every day. When the members saw that they could save money and the pigs liked to eat it, they all agreed to use fermented feed. Therefore, the whole cooperative launched the work of collecting feed. Whatever grew on trees, on the ground, or in the water that pigs could eat was used to feed pigs. They found a total of more than 100 kinds of weeds and wild vegetables that could be used as feed. The members said: This time, there is no need to worry about pig feed. There is pig feed in the sky (referring to trees), on the ground, and in the water.
    According to the cooperative's quantitative feeding of pigs, each pig needs 195 jin of refined feed and 600 jin of roughage (dry) from weaning to maturity and sale. By the end of this year, they will develop to 15,000 pigs, which will require 2,925,000 jin of refined feed and 9 million jin of roughage. Is there any worry about so much feed? No worry, they have made sufficient preparations:
    ① They planted 3,000 mu of sweet potatoes and harvested 8 million jin. In addition to distributing them to the members and keeping seeds, the cooperative used 4.5 million jin to process vermicelli. The members also processed some vermicelli, and the resulting powder residue is a good pig feed. In addition, more than 1 million jin of sweet potato seedlings were harvested, which are also good feed. ② They planted more than 2,500 mu of radishes (including carrots, white radishes, and spring radishes). In addition to human consumption, more than 5 million jin of radishes and more than 380,000 jin of radish leaves can be used as pig feed. ③ They planted 800 mu of pumpkins, with a total harvest of more than 3.8 million jin of pumpkins and 96,000 jin of pumpkin seedlings and leaves, all of which can be used as pig feed. In addition, there are refined feeds such as bran, rice bran, poor-quality grains, bean dregs, and soybean cake, and green roughage such as peanut seedlings, peanut shells, bean leaves, cotton leaves, corn cobs, and tree leaves. After careful calculation, more than 70,000 jin of refined feed can still be left over after feeding 15,000 pigs. Therefore, they plan to increase the number of pigs to 20,000 by next spring.
    The number of pigs in this cooperative has increased rapidly, also because they have implemented the principle of self-breeding and self-raising and attached importance to epidemic prevention and hygiene. The cooperative currently has 47 boars and 1,530 sows, and piglets are born almost every day. Most of the piglets born are sold or loaned to members for private raising, and the cooperative focuses on shaping and improving pig breeds, and mainly develops private raising by members. They cross Berkshire and Yorkshire boars with local pigs, and perform re-breeding on sows. The piglets born are numerous and grow fast, and the members are very willing to raise them. They advise the members not to go to the market to buy pork, but to slaughter and distribute it within the cooperative to prevent buying dead pork and spreading infectious diseases. The breeders in the cooperative have all received certain training, and not only pay attention to the cleaning, hygiene and disinfection of pig pens and troughs at ordinary times, but also everyone can see whether the pigs are sick and isolate and treat them in time, and can also give pigs injections. Special attention is also paid to disinfection when assisting sows in giving birth, so the survival rate of piglets is also relatively high.

    从二十四头到一万五千头
　　——记山东阳谷县石门宋乡农业生产合作社几年来养猪的情形——
    山东阳谷县石门宋乡农业生产合作社是一个二千七百四十户、一万四千一百五十八人的大社，有地三万一千多亩。这个社很重视发展生猪生产，1952年刚建社的时候只有二十四头猪，现在已经发展到一万一千多头了，到今年年底可能达到一万五千头。社里不光是卖猪增加了收入，更重要的是由于养猪积了大量肥料，因而粮食产量逐年增加。过去这里每亩地只打四百多斤粮，去年他们社里每亩地就收了一千零九斤。
    这个社是1952年成立的，当时只有十四户贫农。阳谷县的土地不肥，当地人叫做“买卖地”——意思是不施肥不行，施肥少就少打粮，施肥多才能多打粮。这十四户贫农为了多积肥多打粮，就决定社里要养猪。这一年他们养了二十四头猪，由一个社员专门饲养。到年终卖了十八头肥猪，又有两头母猪下了小猪，社里仍然保持着二十四头猪，扣除人工、饲料，净获利三百七十多元，还积了三百多车猪粪。由于粪肥多，再加上深耕细作，当年每亩地打了六百七十斤粮，而一般单干户每亩地只打四百斤粮。
    1953年他们吸收了四十八户新社员。新入社的社员多是富裕户，不大愿意多养猪。他们认为：养猪费工，既要采集饲料、按顿喂食，又要拉土垫圈，太麻烦；还说猪粪不如豆饼肥力大。社里的领导人员也没有强调多养猪的好处，要肥料就到供销社买豆饼。这年种六百三十亩地，除了买人粪、化学肥料外，还用了六万斤豆饼，每亩平均成本要花十一、二元，值一百五十斤粗粮。结果虽然增产了，社员分到的粮食并不多。有二十七户农民在这种情况下就退社了。
    社里对这一年的工作进行了总结，认为收入少的主要原因是生产成本过高，过多采用豆饼和化学肥料，忽视了养猪这项重要的副业。
    1954年社里只剩下三十五户了，他们吸取过去的经验教训，特别重视了养猪。成立了一个饲养委员会，负责全社的养猪生产。他们计划这一年养八十头猪，并对社里能养多少大猪、多少小猪，需用多少精饲料、多少粗饲料，什么时候喂什么料等等，都做了详细的计划。又挑选了愿意做饲养工作、爱护公共财产的人做饲养员。不到三个月，养八十头猪的数字已经达到了，当年5月份就开始卖猪。他们养的猪送到收购站，每次都被评为一、二等。
    接着，社里又发动社员各家都养猪。当地农民没有养猪的习惯，很多社员不愿意养。困难户说没钱买猪秧子，没钱修圈，没力量拉土垫圈，没饲料；一般户考虑粪肥归社给不给钱？给多少？合算不合算？劳动力多较富裕的户以为反正自己挣的工分就用不完，养不养猪不在乎。根据这三种情况，社干部就分头进行动员，并且帮助社员克服实际困难，由社里贷给困难户猪秧子、猪菜，以换工办法帮助社员修圈、拉土，社和社员订立猪粪归社的合同，规定合理价格，保证一年不变。在这样具体帮助下，有些户开始养猪了。最初私养的猪一共只有十七头；6月份以后，原来对养猪不大重视的社员，看到养猪户真的拿到了猪粪钱，社里真帮助解决问题，养猪真是有利，于是也纷纷买猪喂养。到年底，社员私养的猪就达到七十头；社里公养的猪发展到一百四十头。
    这一年，他们全社卖了一百零五头肥猪，粮食产量每亩增加到九百六十斤，社员普遍感到满意。原来退社的农户，又有二十四户要求入社了。
    1955年这个社是五十九户，三百零六口人，养了三百六十头猪，平均每人养一头多。这一年他们卖了一百八十五头猪，卖猪的钱相当于农业总收入的27％。全社平均每两亩地就有一头猪的肥可施用。粮食产量每亩增加到一千零九斤。社员们清楚地认识到了养猪的好处。他们说：养猪是合作社的命根子，要想改善生活非养猪不可。
    阳谷县本来不是产猪区，农民也没有家家养猪、年年养猪的习惯，而石门宋乡农业社能够发展到社员平均每人一头猪，这不是一件简单的事。很多地区感到饲料困难不能多养猪，可是国家也并没有给这个社特别优待，他们就养了这么多猪。这是什么原因呢？除社里领导人员重视、有组织、有计划地发展养猪业，使社员体会到养猪有利愿意多养等原因外，更为重要的是，他们能积极设法解决饲料问题。
    粮食统购统销以前，社里喂猪精饲料用得多，大家认为无粮无菜喂不了猪，因此养猪成本很大。1953年社里喂了七十二头猪，大部分都是喂的精饲料。每头猪吃了四百五十斤豆饼、一百五十斤粉渣、还有一部分地瓜（甘薯）秧子；再加上不注意饲养技术和防疫卫生，结果连工带料每头猪赔了一元八角。
    1954年春末，山东省召开了关于养猪的座谈会，会上提出用青饲料发酵喂猪。副社长宋保恩参加了这个会，回到社里进行试验。开头猪不爱吃，四、五天以后就爱吃了。喂了半个月，做了一次总结：以前每天要用四百七十斤到五百斤干菜喂猪，用发酵饲料以后，每天可以省出二百斤干菜，这样每天就可以节约三元多钱。社员们一看能省钱，猪也爱吃，都赞成用发酵饲料了。于是全社展开了采集饲料的工作。树上长的、地上长的、水里长的，凡是猪能吃的都用来喂猪。他们一共找到了一百多种能作饲料的野草野菜。社员说：这回猪饲料不发愁了，天上（指树上）、地上、水里都是猪饲料。
    按着他们社里喂猪的定量，每头猪从断奶到长成出卖，需要一百九十五斤精饲料，六百斤粗饲料（干的）。今年年底他们要发展到一万五千头猪，就需要精饲料二百九十二万五千斤，粗饲料九百万斤。这样多的饲料愁不愁呢？也不愁，他们已经有了充足的准备：
    ①种了三千亩地瓜（甘薯），收获八百万斤。除了分给社员和留出种籽外，社里用四百五十万斤加工粉丝，社员也加工一部分粉丝，所出的粉渣是很好的猪饲料。此外还收了一百多万斤地瓜秧子，也是很好的饲料。②种了二千五百多亩萝卜（包括葫萝卜、白萝卜、春萝卜），除人吃外，还有五百多万斤萝卜和三十八万多斤萝卜叶子可用作猪饲料。③种了八百亩南瓜，共收三百八十多万斤瓜和九万六千斤瓜秧、瓜叶子，都可用作猪饲料。此外，还有麸子、米糠、秕粮、豆渣、豆饼等精饲料和花生秧、花生壳、豆叶、棉叶，玉米轴、树叶等青粗饲料。经过仔细核算，喂一万五千头猪，还可以余出七万多斤精饲料。因此，他们计划到明年春季再把养猪数增加到两万头。
    这个社的猪增加得快，也由于他们贯彻执行了自繁自养的原则和重视防疫卫生工作。他们社目前有公猪四十七头，母猪一千五百三十头，几乎每天都有小猪生下来。生下来的小猪多半都卖给或贷给社员私养，社里偏重于定型、改良猪种工作，而以发展社员私养为主。他们用巴克夏、约克夏种猪与当地猪杂交，并对母猪进行复配，生下来的猪崽既多又长的快，社员很愿意养。他们劝社员不要到市上去买猪肉吃，由社内自宰分食，以防止买到死猪肉，传染病疫。社里的饲养员都经过一定的训练，不但平时注意猪圈、食槽等的清洁卫生消毒工作，而且每个人都能看出猪是否有病，及时进行隔离治疗，也能给猪打针。在给母猪接生的时候，也特别注意消毒工作，因而小猪的成活率也比较高。
