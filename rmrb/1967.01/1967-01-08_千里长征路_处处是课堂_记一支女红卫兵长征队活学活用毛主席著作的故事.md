On November 25th, on the western viewing platform in front of Tiananmen Square, a long march team from Fengcheng County, near the Yalu River, named "The Chinese People Have Great Aspirations," raised high the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and with tears of joy, shouted enthusiastically to our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao. This long march team, consisting of seven female Red Guards, strictly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, constantly focusing on their own ideological transformation, ensuring that each member not only marched a victorious long march with their two feet but also completed a victorious long march in their thoughts.

"Guided by Mao Zedong Thought"

When the news of the "Long March Red Guards" from Dalian Maritime Academy marching on foot reached Fengcheng County Middle School, senior student Song Xuejun immediately began to rally her female classmates: "Be female Red Guards, march on!" She rallied six female classmates, preparing to organize the first female long march team. However, some people commented: "Long march? It's not that simple. Young girls walking to Beijing? Don't dream!" "Don't seek attention, just take the train!" Some even used the presence of mountains and wild beasts on the road to scare them. Others suggested: "If you go, go with the male students!" Some male students even volunteered: "You don't have a leader, I'll be your leader."

However, they thought: Can't female students march alone? Can we be intimidated by the difficulties on the road and the ridicule of others? No. On the evening of the 16th, they held a meeting together. Everyone opened their shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud: "We must acknowledge difficulties, analyze difficulties, and fight against difficulties." "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." Chairman Mao's teachings made everyone's blood boil with excitement and passion. One after another, they said: "Long march is revolution, revolution is not afraid of difficulties, fear of difficulties is not revolutionary!" "Thousands of difficulties, with Mao Zedong Thought, there are no difficulties!" "Without a compass, Mao Zedong Thought is the compass!" "Without a leader, rely on Mao Zedong Thought to lead!"

It was at this meeting that a female long march team with an average age of only seventeen, named "The Chinese People Have Great Aspirations," was officially born!

The next morning, golden sunlight filled the earth. This small long march team, carrying a red flag with fourteen golden characters embroidered on it, "Without experiencing wind and frost, how can one know the hardships of the pioneers," carrying Chairman Mao's works, with a strong desire to transform their thoughts, backpacks on their backs, and vigorous steps, set off towards the center of the Cultural Revolution, towards our great leader Chairman Mao's location—Beijing.

"However difficult, we will endure it"

When the long march team arrived in Suizhong County, it was already dark. Suizhong County is famous for its fruits, with pink apples and golden pears filling the streets, emitting an enticing fragrance. It would be so good to stay here for a night! But they did not stay.

There were a few days when they stayed in cities, sleeping in brightly lit hotels or guest houses, on warm and comfortable beds. Once their bodies were comfortable, their limbs became lazy. Some did not want to fetch water or sweep the floor, and some did not want to get up early the next morning. Everyone realized that this was wrong, and they opened their most beloved little red book to see how Chairman Mao taught: "Individualism in the aspect of enjoyment is also quite common in the Red Army. They always hope that the troops will march to big cities. They go to big cities not to work, but to enjoy..." Our great leader Chairman Mao's words, are they not pointing out the root of the problem for these seven young comrades? From then on, they made up their minds: stay in the countryside, not in the city! The more difficult, the more we will endure it! They said: "Revolutioning comfortably will lead to comfortable retrogression! On the road of ideological revolution, if one only endures hardship under compulsion, that is a defensive battle. Only by consciously enduring hardship, launching an offensive battle, can one most effectively eliminate the 'self' and most firmly establish the 'public.'"

Another long march team was also persuaded by them and decided not to stay in the county. That day, the two teams walked eight miles in the dark together and arrived at a small mountain village. They participated in the village's community meeting, listened to the poor and lower-middle peasants introduce the local class struggle situation, and received a profound education together. That day, everyone was very tired from walking, but they gained a lot in their thoughts and were very happy in spirit.

The Story of the Pears

On the long march, how many big and small things tested each member!

One noon, this long march team had walked dozens of miles, and everyone was sweating profusely and thirsty. They sat down to rest by the roadside. Suddenly, a horse-drawn carriage came by, loaded with fragrant pears just picked from the trees. "Red Guards, you've worked hard, have a few pears to quench your thirst," a peasant said kindly, throwing pears to them.

"Thank you, we're not thirsty!" One of the team members said, and everyone picked up the pears and put them back on the carriage. But the peasant said even more earnestly: "Eat, we poor peasants are one family, eating a few pears is no big deal." Then he threw more pears down. At this time, another peasant raised his whip and the two horses pulled the carriage away. "We might as well eat them, after all, we are one family with the poor peasants!" Long march team member Xiao Yue Dan said helplessly. But her words had barely left her mouth when she suddenly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "...not taking a needle or thread from the masses..." "We must improve our discipline, strictly execute orders, policies, and the three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention..." She seemed to hear someone saying to her: Little Red Guard Xiao Yue Dan! You often think of the story of the "Watermelon Brothers," don't you? You weren't moved to tears when you read about how the Eighth Route Army passed by the watermelon field, and the old man cut open a watermelon for the soldiers to eat, but no one took a step, just waved their hands and kept marching forward? Now, facing these pears, how will you handle it? "No, we can't eat them!" Xiao Yue Dan said firmly. She and her comrades picked up the pears from the ground and ran after the horse-drawn carriage that had gone far away.

Although Xiao Yue Dan did not eat the pears this time, she did not let go of the initial thought of wanting to eat the pears. She said meaningfully: "My thought of wanting to eat pears was just a fleeting thought, but this thought is an expression of selfish thoughts. For any selfish thoughts, they must be thoroughly eradicated."

"Not a Small Matter"

The long march team was getting closer to Beijing, and the young comrades' eagerness to see Chairman Mao was becoming more urgent. They couldn't wait to fly to Beijing, to fly to the side of our great leader Chairman Mao. One day, the youngest team member was leading the way in front. She was very impatient and always thought the road was too long. Suddenly, a long bend appeared in front of them, and she did not hesitate to cut straight through a newly plowed field. The team, following behind, hesitated for a moment, saying: "Can't we go?" But the small team had already walked into the soft field.

Xun Shujun felt very uneasy. She was the duty officer for the day, which meant she was the team leader and the political instructor for the day. She felt that she had not led the team well that day. Although the comrades had walked straight with their feet, their thoughts had taken a detour, and this detour could not be taken! She suggested holding a study session. At this time, someone did not understand, thinking that walking on the blank land was nothing, and there was no need to make a big deal out of it. Xun Shujun, however, opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action... must be in the interest of the people." After hearing Chairman Mao's words, the young comrades were all moved, and everyone said that Xun Shujun's suggestion was not a small matter, but a matter of whether to establish a "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. The short study session gave everyone a profound education on serving the people. From then on, the team members not only did not trample on an inch of the commune's land themselves, but also every time they saw livestock trampling the commune's crops, no matter how far the road was or how tired they were, they would run over to drive the livestock away. Once, they saw scattered rice grains on the road, and the cart pulling the rice had already gone far ahead. They bent down and picked up the rice grains cleanly, then ran up and handed the rice grains to the cart driver. The cart driver took the rice grains bundled together with both hands and said excitedly: "You are truly the little red guards educated by Chairman Mao!"

Thus, relying on Mao Zedong Thought, the long march team walked two thousand miles on foot and successfully arrived in Beijing. Although they were all still young, each of them had a heart of red, determined to temper themselves to perfection. They took a new step on the road of ideological revolution.

"The world is yours, it is also ours, but in the end, it is yours." Dear Chairman Mao! Today, how many young long marchers, shouldering your earnest expectations, basking in your sunlight, with the spirit of "seizing the day," are growing rapidly!

    千里长征路　处处是课堂
    ——记一支女红卫兵长征队活学活用毛主席著作的故事
    十一月二十五日，在天安门前西观礼台上，一支来自鸭绿江畔凤城县的“中华儿女多奇志”长征队，高举着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，热泪盈眶地向我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席尽情欢呼。这支由七名女红卫兵组成的长征队，一路上严格遵照毛主席的教导，时时事事狠抓自己的思想改造，使得每个队员不仅开动两只脚进行了一次胜利的长征，而且在思想上也进行了一次胜利的长征。
    “靠毛泽东思想领队”
    当大连海运学院“长征红卫队”步行串连的消息，传到鸭绿江畔的凤城县中学时，高三班同学宋学军，立刻在女同学中酝酿起来：“当女红军，长征去！”她串连了六个女同学，准备组织第一个女长征队。这时却有人议论说：“长征？可不那么简单。黄毛丫头步行到北京，别做梦了！”“别出风头啦，还是坐车去吧！”还有的拿什么路上有高山有野兽来吓唬她们。也有人向她们建议：“要去，就和男同学一块去！”甚至有的男同学自告奋勇：“你们没有领队，我当你们的领队。”
    但是，她们想：难道女同学就不能单独长征吗？难道我们就可以被路上的困难和别人的讽刺吓倒吗？不能。十六日晚上，她们在一起开了一个会，大家打开红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，集体朗读道：“我们要承认困难，分析困难，向困难作斗争”。“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的教导，使得她们个个热血沸腾，激昂慷慨。你一言，我一语：“长征是革命，革命不怕难，怕难不革命！”“千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难！”“没有指南针，毛泽东思想就是指南针！”“没有领队，靠毛泽东思想领队！”
    就在这个会上，一个平均年龄只有十七岁的女子长征队——“中华儿女多奇志”长征队正式诞生了！
    第二天早晨，金色的阳光铺满大地，这支小小的长征队，打着一面绣着“不经一番风霜苦，那知先辈创业难”的十四个金黄大字红旗，怀揣毛主席著作，满怀改造思想的强烈愿望，背着背包，迈开矫健的步伐向着文化大革命的中心，向着我们伟大领袖毛主席所在的地方——北京出发了。
    “怎么艰苦，就怎么锻炼”
    长征队走到绥中县城的时候，天已经黑了。绥中县是有名的水果之乡，粉红的苹果，金黄的大梨，摆满街头，散发着诱人的清香，在这里住宿一夜该多好啊！但是她们不住。
    有几天她们也住宿在城市，睡在灯光明亮的旅馆或招待站里，睡在暖和舒适的床铺上。身体一舒服，四肢就变懒了，有的人不愿挑水、扫地，有的人第二天早晨迟迟不愿起床。大家意识到这种作法不对，她们翻开最心爱的语录本，看看毛主席是怎样教导的：“个人主义见于享乐方面的，在红军中也有不少的人。他们总是希望队伍开到大城市去。他们要到大城市不是为了去工作，而是为了去享乐。……”我们伟大领袖毛主席的这段话，不正是给七位小将找出问题的根源了吗？从此她们下定决心：住乡村，不住城市！怎么艰苦，就怎么锻炼！她们说：“舒舒服服革命，就会舒舒服服倒退！在思想革命化的道路上，如果只是被迫吃苦，那打的是防御战，而自觉吃苦，打进攻战，才能最有效地消灭‘私’字，最牢固地树立‘公’字。”
    另外有一个长征队被她们说服了，也决定不住县城。这一天两个队共同摸黑走了八里路，赶到一个小小的山村。他们参加了村里的社员会，听贫下中农介绍了当地阶级斗争的情况，共同受到一次深刻的教育。这一天大家虽然都走得很累，但思想上却有很大收获，精神非常愉快。
    梨子的故事
    在长征路上，该有多少大大小小的事情，在考验着每一个队员！
    一天中午，这支长征队已经走了几十里路，队员们个个汗流浃背，口干舌燥，大家在公路边坐下来休息。这时，忽然来了一辆马车，车上装满了香气扑鼻的梨子，是公社社员刚从树上摘下来的。“红卫兵同志们，你们辛苦了，吃几个梨解解渴吧！”一位社员亲切地说着就拿起一个个的梨子向她们抛过来。
  “谢谢你们，我们不渴！”不知那位队员说了一声，大家就都捡起梨子仍然放回到车上去。但是社员说得更恳切了：“吃吧，咱们贫下中农一家人，吃几个梨有什么关系？”接着又把梨子抛下来。这时另一个社员举起长鞭一扬，两匹骏马拉着大车跑掉了。“只好吃吧，反正贫下中农一家人！”长征队员小岳丹无可奈何地说。但她的话刚刚出口，就猛然想起了毛主席的教导：“……不拿群众一针一线……”“必须提高纪律性，坚决执行命令，执行政策，执行三大纪律八项注意……”。她仿佛听到谁在对她这样说：红小兵小岳丹啊！你不是经常想着那个“西瓜兄弟”的故事吗？你不是当读到八路军路过西瓜地旁，老乡切开西瓜让战士们吃，而谁都只是摆摆手一步不停地向前走的故事感动得流过泪吗？现在你面对着这些梨子，自己怎样处理呢？“不，不能吃！”小岳丹坚定地说。她和同伴们捡起地上的梨子，拔开腿向着那辆走远了的马车追去。
    这一次小岳丹虽然没吃梨子，但她却不放松当初那个想吃梨子的念头，她意味深长地说：“我想吃梨子虽然是个一闪而过的念头，可是这个念头却是一种私心杂念的表现，对于任何私心杂念，都要把它彻底挖掉。”
    “不是小题”
    长征队离北京越来越近，小将们渴望见到毛主席的心情越来越迫切。他们恨不得一下子飞到北京，飞到我们伟大领袖毛主席的身边。这一天，一个最小的队员在前面带路，她性子特别急，总嫌路太长。突然前面出现了一大节弯路，她毫不犹豫地从一块刚翻耕过的庄稼地里直插过去。跟在后面的郇树军迟疑了一下，说：“不能走吧？”但是这支小小的队伍已经全部走进松软的田地里。
    郇树军心里很不安，她是当天的值日生，也就是当天的队长，当天的指导员，她感到是自己没有把当天的队伍带好，同志们虽然两脚走了直路，思想上却走了弯路，这个弯路走不得啊！她建议大家开个讲用会。这时有人想不通，认为走的是空白地，算不了什么，不必小题大作。郇树军却打开了《毛主席语录》，高声朗读道：“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动……都要适合人民的利益。”听了毛主席的话，小将们都很震动，大家都说，郇树军提出的不是小题，而是关系到有没有树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的大问题。短短的讲用会使每个人都受到一次深刻的为人民服务的教育。自那以后，队员们不仅自己再没踏坏公社的一寸土地，而且每次看到牲畜糟踏公社的庄稼，不管路多远，自己多累，都要跑过去把牲畜赶走。有一次，她们看到公路上撒着一些稀稀疏疏的稻穗，拉稻子的大车已经在前面走得很远了。她们弯下腰把稻穗拾得干干净净，然后跑上去，把稻穗送给赶车的社员。那个社员双手接过扎成一束束的稻穗，激动地说：“你们真是毛主席教育出来的红小兵！”
    就这样，长征队依靠毛泽东思想步行两千里，胜利到达北京。她们的年龄虽然都还小，但是人人都有一颗要把自己锻炼得炉火纯青的红心。在思想革命化的道路上迈出了新的一步。
      “世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。”亲爱的毛主席啊！今天，有多少长征小将们，肩负着您的殷切期望，在您的阳光沐浴下，带着“只争朝夕”的豪情壮志，飞快地在成长！
