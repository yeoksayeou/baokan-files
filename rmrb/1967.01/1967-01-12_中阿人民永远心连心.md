After watching the performance by the heroic nation of the eagle, the great socialist beacon of Europe—Albania's National Song and Dance Ensemble, my emotions were stirred for a long time. The cheers of "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Beijing—Tirana" echoed in my ears for a long time.

The performance, with its high revolutionary passion and exquisite artistic skills, enthusiastically praised the close and fraternal friendship between the two parties and two countries of China and Albania. It enthusiastically sang the praises of our most beloved great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, and Comrade Enver Hoxha. When they sang in Chinese our most beloved songs, "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "We Should Believe in the Masses, We Should Believe in the Party," the entire audience was moved to join in the singing. With their enthusiastic spirit and powerful voices, they sang "Song of Red Friendship" and "Tirana—Beijing," fully expressing the deep combat friendship between the peoples of China and Albania.

The final performance, "Dance of Friendship," is the most unforgettable for me. The scene was so touching! Workers, peasants, soldiers from China and Albania, Chinese Red Guards, and Albanian youth students appeared on stage, hand in hand and arm in arm, full of vigor and fighting spirit. This fully expressed Albania's strong support for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and fully expressed Chairman Hoxha's words: "The Albanian Party of Labor and the Albanian People's Republic, together with the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China, will build an iron wall that will make all our enemies smash their heads to pieces."

After watching the performance by Albania's National Song and Dance Ensemble, we are even more convinced of Chairman Mao's words: "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together."

    中阿人民永远心连心
    董铁志
    看了来自英雄的山鹰之国、欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义明灯——阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国家歌舞团的访问演出，我的心情激动得久久不能平静。“毛泽东—恩维尔”、“北京—地拉那”的欢呼声长时间在我的耳边回旋。
    歌舞团的演出以高度的革命激情，精湛的艺术技巧，热烈地颂扬中阿两党两国亲密无间的伟大友谊，热烈地歌唱我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，热烈地歌唱恩维尔·霍查同志。当他们用中国话引吭高歌我们最喜爱的歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》和毛主席语录歌《我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党》的时候，全场观众都激动得同声欢唱起来。他们以饱满的情绪，响亮的歌喉，高唱《红色友谊之歌》、《地拉那——北京》，充分表达了中阿两国人民的深厚的战斗友谊。
    演出的最后一个节目《友谊之舞》，是我最难忘怀的。那场面是多么动人心弦啊！中阿两国的工人、农民、战士，中国的红卫兵和阿尔巴尼亚的青年学生，意气风发，斗志昂扬，手携手，臂挽臂地出现在舞台上，充分表达了兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚对中国无产阶级文化大革命的有力支持，充分表达了霍查同志所说的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国“同中国共产党和中华人民共和国筑成一条使我们的一切敌人碰得头破血流的铜墙铁壁”的伟大真理。
    看了阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团的演出，我们更加坚信毛主席的话：“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
