Chinese experts working in Mali not only wholeheartedly assist the Malian people in their construction efforts but also, following Chairman Mao's teachings, pay great attention to the local residents' lives. For the residents near their living quarters, who cook by propping up pots on bricks over open fires, which is both inconvenient and wasteful of firewood, the Chinese experts helped them build stoves. Malian women do not have washing boards and wash clothes on their legs, so the Chinese experts made some washing boards and gave them to the women. Therefore, whenever the Chinese experts go out, the nearby residents, including the elderly, women, and children, wave to them from afar and greet them in Chinese.

    关心群众生活
    在马里工作的中国专家不仅全心全意帮助马里人民建设，而且遵照毛主席的教导，十分关怀当地居民的生活。在他们住处附近的居民，做饭时在地上用砖头支着锅烧火，不好烧又费柴，中国专家就帮他们砌了灶。马里妇女洗衣没有洗衣板，在腿上搓，中国专家又做了些洗衣板送给她们。所以每逢中国专家出来，附近的居民、老人、妇女、小孩都老远就向他们招手，用中国话向他们问好。
