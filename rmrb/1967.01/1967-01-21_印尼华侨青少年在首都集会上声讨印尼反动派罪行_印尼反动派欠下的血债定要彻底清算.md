Indonesian Overseas Chinese Youth Denounce Indonesian Reactionaries' Crimes at Capital Rally
The Blood Debt of the Indonesian Reactionaries Must Be Settled Completely

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 20th, forty-one overseas Chinese youth who bravely fought in Indonesian prisons and two representatives of the overseas Chinese youth who participated in the anti-violence struggle at the "refugee camp" of the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School, today at a rally of five thousand people in the capital, angrily denounced and condemned the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionaries against the Chinese, and enthusiastically hailed Mao Zedong Thought as the spiritual atomic bomb to defeat all enemies.

The overseas Chinese youth, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses attending the meeting unanimously and resolutely supported the series of protest notes recently presented by the Chinese government to the Indonesian government. They said: The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. The blood debt owed by the Indonesian reactionaries will one day be settled completely.

The meeting was presided over by a representative of the Beijing Committee for Receiving Forty-One Revolutionary Overseas Chinese Youth. Among the forty-one overseas Chinese youth, Yu Yazhou and He Derong, and Liu Ruixia, a representative of the overseas Chinese youth who participated in the anti-violence struggle at the "refugee camp" of the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School, stepped onto the stage one after another, filled with indignation, and denounced with a wealth of facts the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries in persecuting the overseas Chinese. In their denunciations, they pointed out that over the past year, the Indonesian reactionaries, in order to cater to the needs of American imperialism, have been madly suppressing the communists and the people while wantonly persecuting the innocent overseas Chinese who have lived in harmony with the Indonesian people for generations. The right-wing military regime in Indonesia has repeatedly dispatched military police and organized thugs to attack and loot overseas Chinese shops and residences, destroy and seize overseas Chinese schools and organizations, and brutally massacre overseas Chinese. In their places of residence in Indonesia, such as the Aceh Province, countless compatriots have been arrested and killed, beaten and humiliated, and countless overseas Chinese have had their property looted and their homes burned down. The illegal arrest, torture, and the November 9, 1966, attack by thugs on the "refugee camp" of the Medan Overseas Chinese Middle School involving the forty-one overseas Chinese youth were all incidents deliberately planned and organized by the right-wing military regime in Indonesia.

The overseas Chinese youth pointed out that the Indonesian reactionaries are intensifying their anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese policies at a time when American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism are further colluding against China, actively serving as a lackey to earn rewards from the Americans and Soviets. The more the Indonesian reactionaries adopt barbaric methods to suppress the communists and the people, and the more they brazenly persecute the overseas Chinese, the more they will provoke the anger of the broad masses of the Indonesian people and the overseas Chinese. The deep friendship between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people, forged through common labor and common struggle, is something that no reactionary forces can destroy. The Indonesian reactionaries, who have done so much evil, will surely meet a bad end.

At the meeting, the overseas Chinese youth also reported on how, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, they maintained the dignity and honor of their motherland with the fearless spirit of revolutionary rebellion, and bravely fought against American imperialism and its lackey, the Indonesian reactionaries. They also expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and across the country, and, together with the people of the entire country, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

A representative of the Beijing Red Guards also spoke at the meeting, expressing the strongest protest against the Indonesian reactionaries' heinous crimes of massacring and persecuting the overseas Chinese, and paying the highest respect to the overseas Chinese youth who dare to fight and dare to win under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. He said, the great socialist motherland led by Chairman Mao is the strongest support for the overseas Chinese. The seven hundred million people of the motherland, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and the countless Red Guards who dare to rebel against American imperialism and all reactionaries, are determined to be the strong backing of the patriotic overseas Chinese. If the Indonesian reactionaries insist on persecuting the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Indonesia, we will resolutely fight them to the end!

Representatives of the Indonesian Students' Federation in China, such as Sharmadi, held up portraits of Chairman Mao and banners written in Chinese and Indonesian, such as "The Road of Mao Zedong is the Only Road to Victory for the Indonesian People's Revolution" and "The Fighting Friendship Between the Peoples of Indonesia and China Will Last Forever," and attended today's meeting. After hearing the angry denunciations of the overseas Chinese youth, they stood up from their seats again and again, waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and loudly shouted, "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" As soon as Yu Yazhou, a representative of the forty-one overseas Chinese youth, finished speaking, Sharmadi excitedly walked forward and warmly embraced him. At this moment, the forty-one overseas Chinese youth shouted in unison, "Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people!" The entire venue was filled with a strong atmosphere of unity and struggle.

　　印尼华侨青少年在首都集会上声讨印尼反动派罪行
　　印尼反动派欠下的血债定要彻底清算
    据新华社二十日讯　在印度尼西亚监狱里进行了英勇斗争的四十一名华侨青少年和参加棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”抗暴斗争的两名难侨青年代表，今天在首都五千人的集会上，向祖国亲人和全世界人民，愤怒地控诉和声讨印尼反动派反华排华的法西斯暴行，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想是战胜一切敌人的精神原子弹。
    参加大会的华侨青少年、红卫兵和革命群众一致坚决拥护我国政府最近向印尼政府提出的一系列抗议照会。他们说：用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不好惹的，印尼反动派欠下的血债，总有一天要彻底清算。
    大会由首都接待四十一名华侨革命青少年工作委员会的代表主持。四十一名华侨青少年中的余亚周、何德荣和参加过棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”抗暴斗争的难侨青年代表刘瑞霞，怀着满腔仇恨的怒火，先后走上讲台，以大量的事实，控诉印尼反动派残酷迫害华侨的滔天罪行。他们在控诉中指出，一年多来，印尼反动派为了迎合美帝国主义的需要，在疯狂地反共反人民的同时，恣意迫害世代同印尼人民友好相处的广大无辜华侨。印尼右派军人政权不断出动军警，组织暴徒袭击和抢掠华侨的商店、住宅，捣毁和霸占华侨的学校、团体，对华侨进行野蛮的屠杀。在他们侨居的印尼亚齐省等地，就有难以数计的侨胞被逮捕杀戮，被殴打凌辱，还有无数华侨被抢光了财物，被烧毁了家园。四十一名华侨青少年的被非法逮捕、严刑拷打和去年十一月九日棉兰华侨中学难侨“收容所”遭到暴徒的猖狂袭击的事件，就是印尼右派军人政权有计划有组织地制造出来的。
    华侨青少年们指出，印尼反动派这样加紧反华排华，是在当前美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义进一步勾结反华的时候，积极地充当一名走卒，以换取美苏的犒赏。印尼反动派越是采取野蛮的手段反共反人民，越是肆无忌惮地反华排华，就越激起广大印尼人民和华侨的愤怒。中国人民和印尼人民在共同劳动和共同战斗中结成的深厚友谊，是任何反动势力也破坏不了的。做尽了坏事的印尼反动派，决不会有什么好下场。
    在大会上，华侨青少年们还报告了他们在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，为了维护祖国的尊严和荣誉，以革命造反的无畏精神，同美帝国主义及其走狗印尼反动派进行英勇斗争的事迹。他们还表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，学习上海市和全国各地革命造反派的革命造反精神，和全国人民一道，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    首都红卫兵的代表也在大会上讲话，对印尼反动派疯狂屠杀和迫害华侨的滔天罪行表示最强烈的抗议，对高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的华侨青少年表示崇高的敬意。他说，毛主席领导的伟大的社会主义祖国是华侨最有力的靠山。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿祖国人民，成千成万敢于大造美帝国主义和一切反动派的反的红卫兵，誓做爱国华侨的坚强后盾。印尼反动派如果一意孤行，继续迫害印尼广大侨胞，我们就坚决和它斗争到底！
    印尼在华学生联合会代表沙尔玛迪等，高举着毛主席像，以及用中文、印尼文写的“毛泽东的道路是印尼人民革命胜利的唯一道路”、“印尼、中国两国人民之间的战斗友谊万古长青”等标语牌，出席了今天的大会。他们听了华侨青少年的愤怒控诉，一次又一次地从座位上站起来，挥舞着《毛主席语录》，大声高呼：“打倒印尼反动派！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”四十一名华侨青少年的代表余亚周刚讲完话，沙尔玛迪便激动地走上前去，和他热烈拥抱。这时，四十一名华侨青少年一齐高呼：“坚决支持印尼人民的革命斗争！”全场充满了团结战斗的强烈气氛。
