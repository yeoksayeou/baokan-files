	Soviet Revisionist military police and secret agents brutally suppressed our students in a premeditated serious incident. Our embassy lodged the most severe and strongest protest. The Soviet government must publicly apologize, severely punish the culprits, and take full responsibility for all consequences. The Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs played the bully and threatened, only to be sternly refuted by our Chargé d'Affaires on the spot.

	New China News Agency, Moscow, January 25th - At 6:30 PM on January 25th, the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union submitted the most severe and strongest protest note to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the serious incident where Chinese students studying in Europe were brutally suppressed by Soviet military police and plainclothes secret agents while paying their respects at the mausoleums of Lenin and Stalin.

	The note stated: "Sixty-nine Chinese students studying in Europe, while passing through Moscow, paid their respects to the great revolutionary leader Lenin and the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin by laying wreaths. After a moment of silence, our students read from 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' when Soviet military police pushed, pulled, and beat our female students. When our students sang 'The Internationale,' a large number of Soviet military police and plainclothes secret agents immediately attacked and beat our entire group, resulting in a horrifying and serious bloodshed incident. All our students and embassy escorts, as well as Xinhua News Agency reporters, were brutally suppressed by Soviet military police, with over thirty injured, among whom ten had blood streaming down their faces, several were knocked unconscious on the spot, and four had severe injuries. Soviet military police also tore our people's clothes and seized items they were carrying. This was a premeditated serious incident by the Soviet government. Soviet workers on the scene shouted 'Don't hit them,' expressing strong dissatisfaction with the Soviet military police's atrocities. This is a heinous crime of the Soviet government betraying the great Lenin, and another ironclad evidence of the Soviet government's hostility towards the Chinese people. For this, the Chinese Embassy lodges the most severe and strongest protest to the Soviet government, demanding that the Soviet government publicly apologize and severely punish the culprits. The Soviet government shall bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from this incident."

	Prior to this, when Chinese students were beaten up in Red Square, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union, An Zhi Yuan, immediately made four phone calls to request a meeting with any representative of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly declined and refused to meet. An Zhi Yuan, out of necessity, personally went to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and waited in the courtyard, repeatedly requesting assistance from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs security to arrange a meeting with the director, deputy minister, or any representative of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. When An Zhi Yuan, the Chargé d'Affaires, encountered the assistant to the director of the Protocol Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Du Jian Yang, he formally requested an appointment. Du Jian Yang agreed to arrange it on the spot. However, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to make excuses and refused to meet. Thus, An Zhi Yuan, the Chargé d'Affaires, waited in vain for over an hour and had to return to the embassy. Subsequently, our embassy staff continued to call the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but due to their guilt and shame, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs still refused to meet.

	At 6:30 PM, after the Chinese Embassy submitted a protest note to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the incident where Chinese students were brutally suppressed by Soviet military police and plainclothes secret agents, at 7:20 PM, Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fei Liu Bin met with An Zhi Yuan, the Chargé d'Affaires, and presented a completely distorted so-called "oral statement." This "statement" falsely accused Chinese students and Chinese embassy staff of "grossly violating the regulations for visiting Lenin's Mausoleum," "disrupting order," "using force," and "engaging in provocative hooligan behavior," and shamelessly expressed "strong protest" to the Chinese Embassy. The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs even threatened to "prohibit Chinese citizens from transiting through the Soviet Union."

	An Zhi Yuan, the Chargé d'Affaires, immediately refuted the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs' "oral statement" with strong words.

　　苏修军警特务血腥镇压我留学生是苏联政府预谋的严重事件
　　我大使馆提出最严重最强烈抗议
　　苏联政府必须公开道歉严惩凶手并对一切后果负完全责任
　　苏联外交部副部长大耍无赖和威胁，当场遭到我临时代办严词驳斥
    新华社莫斯科二十五日电　中国驻苏联大使馆二十五日下午六时三十分，就中国留欧学生向列宁和斯大林陵墓敬献花圈时遭到苏联军警和便衣特务血腥镇压这一严重事件，向苏联外交部提交了最严重、最强烈的抗议照会。
    照会说：“中国留欧学生六十九人路过莫斯科时，向伟大的革命导师列宁和伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林敬献花圈。在默哀后，我留学生朗读《毛主席语录》时，苏联军警推、拉并殴打我女学生，当我学生高唱《国际歌》时，苏联大批军警和便衣特务即对我全体人员围攻毒打，造成骇人听闻的严重流血事件。我全体同学和使馆陪同人员以及新华社记者都遭到苏联军警血腥镇压，受伤三十余人，其中十余人满脸流血，当场数人被打昏倒在地上，伤势极为严重的有四人。苏联军警还撕破我方人员衣服，抢走我方人员随身携带的东西。这是苏联政府蓄意预谋的严重事件。在场的苏联劳动人民高喊‘不许打’，对苏联军警暴行表示强烈的不满。这是苏联政府背叛伟大列宁的滔天罪行，这是苏联政府敌视中国人民的又一铁证。对此，中国大使馆向苏联政府提出最严重、最强烈的抗议，要求苏联政府公开道歉，并严惩凶手。由此产生的一切后果由苏联政府负完全责任。”
    在这以前，当中国学生在红场被殴打后，中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远即接连四次打电话约见苏联外交部任何一个代表。但是，苏联外交部一再推辞，拒绝接见。安致远在不得已的情况下，亲自前往苏联外交部，并在苏联外交部前庭内等候，同时当面多次请苏联外交部门卫协助联系，要求会见苏联外交部的司长、副部长或外交部的任何一个代表。安致远临时代办在苏联外交部前庭遇见苏联外交部的礼宾司司长助理杜锷扬时，也向他正式提出安排会见的要求。杜锷扬曾当面答应给予联系。但是，苏联外交部仍然一再托辞不见。这样，安致远临时代办白白等候了一个多小时，终于不得不返回大使馆。随后，我国大使馆人员一直用电话催问苏联外交部，但是苏联外交部由于心虚理亏，仍拒绝接见。
    下午六时三十分，中国大使馆就中国学生遭到苏联军警和便衣特务血腥镇压事件向苏联外交部提交了抗议照会后，七时二十分，苏联外交部副部长费留宾接见安致远临时代办，竟向他提出了一个完全颠倒是非的所谓
  “口头声明”。这个“声明”反诬中国学生和中国使馆人员“粗暴地破坏拜谒列宁陵墓的规定”、“扰乱秩序”、“动用武力”、“采取挑衅性的流氓行为”等等，并且恬不知耻地向中国大使馆表示“坚决抗议”。苏联外交部甚至还以威胁的口吻扬言，苏联方面要“禁止中国公民在苏联过境”。
    安致远临时代办当即对苏联外交部的“口头声明”给予了有力的驳斥。
