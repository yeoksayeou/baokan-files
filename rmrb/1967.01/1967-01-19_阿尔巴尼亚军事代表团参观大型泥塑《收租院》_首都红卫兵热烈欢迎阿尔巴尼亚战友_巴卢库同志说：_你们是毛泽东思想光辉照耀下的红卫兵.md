They were warmly welcomed by nearly ten thousand Red Guards and revolutionary masses who came to visit.

	After the visit, Comrade Baluku wrote in the guest book: "The exhibition we visited today has great class education significance. The poor peasants of China, allied with the working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, carried out a great people's revolution.

A female Red Guard said to Comrade Baluku: "We Red Guards and revolutionary masses warmly welcome the Albanian comrades to visit our country!" Comrade Baluku replied: "You are Red Guards shining under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, you are true revolutionaries, you are the powerful reserve force of the People's Liberation Army led by Comrade Mao Zedong's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao. Long live the Red Guards! Long live Chairman Mao!" The Red Guards and revolutionary masses responded with enthusiastic applause and shouted: "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!" The Red Guards presented the Albanian comrades with Red Guard armbands and gave them photos and badges of our great leader Chairman Mao.

	Everyone kept shouting: "Mao—Enver!" "Enver—Mao!"

	Today, Central Committee member of the Communist Party of China and Vice Minister of Defense Wang Shusheng and others accompanied the Albanian comrades on their visit.
