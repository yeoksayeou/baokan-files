The "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" is the guiding principle for the people's army in handling relations between soldiers and civilians, and between officers and soldiers. In the process of implementation, there is indeed a struggle in one's mind, especially when one is physically exhausted and in urgent situations, the struggle becomes even more pronounced.

Last May, during a long march by our company, we walked for twelve consecutive days. My feet were blistered and I fell behind. At that moment, I faced two choices: one was a small path through the wheat field, which could save about three or four miles, and the other path would require a detour. At that time, I thought: my body is so tired, taking a shortcut could save some effort. Besides, the small path in the wheat field was already there, it wasn't created by me. Moreover, taking a shortcut could help me catch up with the team faster. So, I went straight through the small path in the wheat field. As I walked, I noticed that the villagers had dug many pits on the path. I thought: the villagers did this to protect the collective's crops, how could I only think of my own convenience and trample through the wheat field to take a shortcut? I was about to turn back, but a new conflict arose in my mind: returning the original way would mean falling behind. Just as I was hesitating, the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" formulated by Chairman Mao reappeared in my mind, "Do not damage crops," these five words were Chairman Mao's orders to me. Thinking of this, I resolutely turned back and quickened my pace, following the winding path to catch up with the team.

This incident made me deeply realize that in general situations, it is relatively easy to follow the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," but in special situations, it is often easy to make compromises. Therefore, at such times, one must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and always consider the interests of the broad masses of the people, not just one's own convenience. In this way, although one may have to endure more hardship and fatigue, the revolutionary discipline is maintained, and one's spiritual realm also takes a big step towards the "public" spirit.

    时刻牢记群众利益就能自觉执行纪律
    副班长　贾继周
    执行“三大纪律八项注意”，是人民子弟兵处理军民关系、官兵关系的行动准则。在执行过程中，思想上并不是没有斗争的，特别是在身体劳累、情况紧急的条件下，有时斗争就更为突出。
    去年五月，我们连在一次长途行军中，连续走了十二天，我的脚打了不少的血泡，掉了队。正在这时，我的面前摆着两条路：一条是麦田里的小路，可以少走三四里路，另一条路就要绕一大圈。当时我想：身体这样累，抄近路可以省点劲，这麦田里的小路原先就有，又不是自己踩出来的，再说抄近路还可以更快地赶上队伍。于是，我就从麦田的小路直插过去。走着走着，发现社员们在路上刨了不少的土坑坑。我想：社员这样做，是为了保护集体的庄稼，我怎么能只顾自己方便，踩着麦田抄近路呢？我正想往回走，心里又产生了新的矛盾：从原路返回，就要掉队。正在犹豫不决的时候，毛主席亲手制定的“三大纪律八项注意”重现在我的脑海中，“不损坏庄稼”，这五个字就是毛主席给我下达的命令。我想到这里，毅然转过身来往回走去，加快步伐，沿着曲折的小路赶上了队伍。
    这件事，使我深刻地认识到：在一般情况下，执行“三大纪律八项注意”，还比较容易，在特殊情况下，就往往容易打折扣。因此，越是在这种时候，就越要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，事事考虑到广大人民群众的利益，不能只顾自己方便。这样，自己虽然可能要多吃一点苦，多受一点累，革命的纪律却得到了维护，自己的精神境界也向“公”字迈进了一大步。
