Mao Zedong's words have the highest authority and the greatest power. Wherever they are applied, they are effective. When we sing work songs, using Mao Zedong's words, our enthusiasm is multiplied a hundredfold.

Now, when we sing the transplanting rice seedlings work song, we use only Mao Zedong's words. For example: "Difficulties are facts. We must acknowledge as many as there are and cannot adopt the policy of 'not acknowledging.'” “When our comrades face difficulties, we must see achievements, see the light, and boost our morale.” When pulling the rope to transplant rice seedlings, we sing about Comrade White's attitude towards work, "extreme responsibility," "pursuit of perfection in technology," "the world fears nothing more than the word 'serious,' the Communist Party values 'serious' the most." Once the work song is sung, no difficulty is insurmountable.

One evening, the six of us were pulling rice seedlings when suddenly a strong wind and heavy rain came. At that moment, some people wavered and wanted to go back. I thought that if we didn't pull the seedlings that night, and waited until the next morning, we would miss half a day's work. As the saying goes, "Time and tide wait for no man." I said to everyone, "Remember what Chairman Mao said, 'The Chinese people are not afraid of death, so why should we be afraid of difficulties?'” I compiled this quote and "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" into a work song, leading everyone to sing together. I also compiled a passage from our literacy textbook into a work song. Everyone sang while working: "Chairman Mao's works are the best, every word is a treasure, shining over the world, the red flag of revolution flutters in the wind; it is the pillar of the revolution, it is our guide; the direction is clear, standing tall, unshaken by storms and waves." The sound of the work song drowned out the thunder and rain. The more we sang, the more energetic we became, and the more we worked, the more energetic we became. We persisted in pulling the seedlings until they were all done before going back.

    革命号子压倒了暴风雨
    许吉凤
    毛主席的话，威信最高，威力最大，用到哪里哪里灵。我们唱劳动号子时用上毛主席的话，就增添了百倍的干劲。
    现在，我们唱栽秧号子，全用毛主席的话。如：碰到困难就唱“困难是事实，有多少就得承认多少，不能采取‘不承认主义’。”“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”拉绳栽秧时，就唱白求恩同志“对工作的极端的负责任”，“对技术精益求精”，“世界上怕就怕‘认真’二字，共产党就最讲‘认真’。”号子一唱，什么困难都不在话下。
    有一天晚上，我们六个人正在拔秧，忽然刮起大风、下起暴雨来。这时有些人动摇了，要回去。我想到第二天没有秧栽，如果等明天上午再拔，就要误半天工。俗话说：“季节不饶人。”我就对大家说：“你们记得毛主席说过的，中国人死都不怕，还怕困难么？”我把这条语录和“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”编成号子，带领大家一起唱。我又把我们识字课本上的一段话也编成号子，大家一面劳动一面唱：“毛主席著作就是好，一字一句都是宝，光芒照耀全世界，革命红旗迎风飘；它是革命的擎天柱，它是我们的指路标；方向明，站得高，大风大浪不动摇。”号子声把雷声和雨声都压下去了。大家越唱越有劲，越干越有劲，坚持把秧拔完了才回去。
