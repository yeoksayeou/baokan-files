The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which began in China in 1966, is the greatest event of the 1960s. This revolution has brought China's socialist revolution to a new stage and opened a new epoch in the history of the international communist movement.

Under Lenin's leadership, the great October Socialist Revolution opened up a new era of proletarian revolution. The October Revolution solved the problem of seizing power through revolutionary violence and establishing proletarian dictatorship, setting a great example for the proletariat of the whole world. However, it was impossible at that time to solve the series of problems concerning who would win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in a socialist country, how to maintain proletarian power, how to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and how to prevent capitalist restoration. The homeland of the October Revolution saw the modern revisionist clique seize the leadership of the party and the state, leading the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, down the road to capitalist restoration. This lesson shows that after the proletariat seizes power, whether it can maintain that power and prevent capitalist restoration has become a new central issue for the international proletariat. It not only decides the fate of proletarian dictatorship states but also the fate of the revolutionary cause of the proletariat and oppressed nations worldwide. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is aimed at solving this problem of great historical significance and setting a new great example for the proletariat of the whole world.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new stage of China's socialist revolution. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, the bourgeois rightists in society and a handful of bourgeois representatives within the party, unwilling to accept the demise of the exploitative system, launched a frenzied attack on the proletariat, attempting to carry out capitalist restoration. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's theory on class and class struggle in socialist society, our party led the proletariat and other revolutionary masses to launch a victorious counterattack against the bourgeoisie's challenge. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a comprehensive confrontation between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and their agents within the party.

After fierce class struggle, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has begun to achieve great victories.

In 1963, under Chairman Mao's personal guidance, China launched a cultural revolution marked by theatrical reform, which was actually the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

From October 1965, Chairman Mao personally initiated the criticism of the anti-party and anti-socialist play "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," the criticism of the "Three Family Village" counter-revolutionary clique, and the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist leaders of the former Beijing Municipal Committee. These actions prepared public opinion and paved the way for the large-scale mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On June 1, 1966, Chairman Mao decided to publish the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism from Beijing University, igniting the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and initiating a mass movement with the focus on striking down a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. A batch of power-holders taking the capitalist road and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" were exposed, and the masses fought them to the ground. The political life, social appearance, and spiritual state of our country underwent profound changes. In this great mass movement, a large number of brave revolutionary pioneers emerged.

The revolutionary road is tortuous. Just as the hundreds of millions of people were rising up to make revolution under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, a few or several responsible comrades working in the Central Committee, taking advantage of Chairman Mao's absence from Beijing, put forward a bourgeois reactionary line, opposing Chairman Mao's correct line. They, along with those responsible comrades who resolutely executed the bourgeois reactionary line, stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, within the scope of their temporary capabilities, implemented bourgeois dictatorship, and attempted to suppress the proletarian Cultural Revolution movement. These people distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, surrounded the revolutionary faction, suppressed dissenting opinions, and implemented white terror. They thought they were successful, boosting the bourgeois spirit and crushing the proletarian will.

At this critical moment, our great helmsman, Chairman Mao, personally presided over the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, adopting the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," which deeply exposed the bourgeois reactionary line. This reactionary line protected a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, colluded with them, suppressed the revolutionary mass movement, and opposed the revolutionary masses. Ultimately, it aimed to lead China towards capitalist restoration.

The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee proclaimed the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the failure of the bourgeois reactionary line, steering the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution back on the correct track. This was a new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought on the road of socialist revolution.

After the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, combined with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, led to a new high tide in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The important sign of this new high tide was the Red Guards movement and the revolutionary mass rallies.

The Red Guards were a new phenomenon that emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In June and July, when the Red Guards first appeared, there were only a few dozen people. At that time, they were slandered as a "reactionary organization" by those who advocated the bourgeois reactionary line and were suppressed and attacked. However, the great proletarian revolutionary leader, Chairman Mao, once he discovered such a new phenomenon as the Red Guards, immediately saw its boundless vitality, praised its proletarian revolutionary spirit of rebellion, and gave it resolute and enthusiastic support. Chairman Mao's voice, like a spring thunder, quickly spread across the country. In a very short time, the Red Guards developed in schools and many factories and rural areas across the country, forming a vast cultural revolution army. The struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools developed into the struggle, criticism, and transformation in society. The revolutionary Red Guards smashed the old customs of the exploiting classes and established the new customs of the proletariat. They stood at the forefront of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. They played a vanguard role.

The revolutionary mass rallies were also a new phenomenon that emerged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and were supported and advocated by the great proletarian revolutionary leader, Chairman Mao. Revolutionary teachers and students held mass rallies nationwide, connecting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement across the country. The revolutionary mass rallies spread Mao Zedong Thought nationwide, promoted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, organized the proletarian revolutionary forces, and powerfully impacted the bourgeois reactionary line.

However, a few stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line were not willing to admit defeat. The bourgeois reactionary line had its social base, mainly the bourgeoisie, and a group of untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The bourgeois reactionary line also had a certain market within the party, which was some cadres whose worldviews had not been transformed or had not been thoroughly transformed. These few stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line, using the social base and influence of this reactionary line within the party, stirred up trouble. They used various tactics, both covert and overt, to resist the proletarian revolutionary line and sabotage the broad revolutionary masses' criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The most important trick of the few stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line was to incite the masses to fight against each other. They secretly organized and manipulated some deceived masses and mass organizations, suppressed the revolution, protected themselves, instigated armed conflicts, and attempted to create chaos. They also spread rumors, distorted right and wrong, and blamed the proletarian revolutionary faction for what they had secretly done, labeling the revolutionary faction with the "bourgeois reactionary line" hat. They continued to attempt to direct the spearhead of struggle towards the revolutionary masses, towards the proletarian revolutionary line, and towards the proletarian revolutionary headquarters.

Just as our party was organizing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution forces according to Chairman Mao's class line, the few stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line used the slogan "The father is a hero, the son is a good man; the father is a reactionary, the son is a rascal" to deceive a group of students, create factions, and disrupt the class line. This slogan was initially proposed by some naive young people. Due to certain one-sidedness in their thinking methods, they started from the correct proposition of opposing the suppression and attack by a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party on revolutionary cadres' children and children of workers and peasants, and went to the other extreme. Towards these naive young people, we should guide them patiently. Our party did just that at the time. However, the stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line maliciously used this slogan to deceive a few students (some of whom were children of uneducated cadres) and attempted to lead them astray, creating opposition with another group of students. Thus, the slogan "The father is a hero, the son is a good man; the father is a reactionary, the son is a rascal" became a tool to oppose the proletarian revolutionary line. It should be pointed out that those with ulterior motives, using this slogan, essentially propagated the reactionary bloodline theory of the exploiting classes. The feudal landlord class propagated what "Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes, and mice beget mice that dig holes," which was exactly this bloodline theory. It was thoroughly reactionary historical idealism.

The few stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line not only did not confess to the masses, did not rehabilitate those who had been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-party elements," "fake leftists, true rightists," "extortionists," etc., by them, and did not publicly destroy the materials used to persecute the revolutionary masses. Instead, they vigorously propagated the "settling accounts later" theory, threatening to deal with the revolutionary masses as "rightists." This line of argument was to counterattack. The proletarian revolutionary faction is not afraid of settling accounts. The "settling accounts later" theory will not intimidate the revolutionary masses. Those who spread this line of argument have incurred a new debt to the party and the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses will definitely settle this account.

The various performances of the few stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line actually exposed themselves. The more fiercely they acted, the more they made the broad masses realize what the bourgeois reactionary line was and that it was necessary to expose and criticize this bourgeois reactionary line.

Why could these stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line deceive some masses at a certain time? Because they used the high prestige of Chairman Mao and the party among the masses. They appropriated the achievements of heaven, claiming to be the embodiment of the party, their actions as the leadership of the party, and believing in the party as believing in themselves. They also particularly propagated such a line of argument: people should not speak principles and unconditionally obey their direct superiors. This line of argument, in fact, advocated blind obedience, advocated slavery, and opposed Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

As early as the 1942 rectification movement, when solving the problem of the Wang Ming line ideologically, Chairman Mao pointed out:

"Communist Party members should question everything with a 'why,' and think it through carefully in their minds, considering whether it conforms to reality and whether it is reasonable. They must not blindly follow and must not advocate slavery."

Chairman Mao often taught us: harmful revolutionary leadership should not be accepted unconditionally but should be resolutely resisted. In fact, in this Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary teachers, students, and revolutionary cadres have widely resisted erroneous leadership.

Firmly accepting and executing the correct leadership of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, firmly resisting harmful revolutionary leadership, and firmly opposing slavery are the political and organizational principles of a proletarian party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. All true communists should act according to this principle firmly, unconditionally, and fearlessly, and correctly propagate this principle to the masses. Once this principle is grasped by the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, those stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party will be disarmed.

Since the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, more than four months have passed. Chairman Mao and his comrades-in-arms have done a lot of political and ideological work for comrades who have made line errors. The broad revolutionary masses have also criticized and educated them. Some comrades have corrected their errors, and some are correcting their errors. This is welcome. For those who are still unwilling to correct their errors, a stern warning should be given: they must stop at the brink of the precipice! If they continue to insist on the bourgeois reactionary line and play tricks on the party and the masses, they will merge with the power-holders taking the capitalist road or prove that they themselves are power-holders taking the capitalist road.

This struggle between the two lines is very profound. The mass movement of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line that has been carried out over the past few months has achieved great victories, making hundreds of millions of people understand the essence of this struggle. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao aims to mobilize the masses to overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," and to eliminate all old things of the exploiting classes. The bourgeois reactionary line, on the other hand, aims to suppress the masses, protect the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," and protect all old things of the exploiting classes. One aims to carry the socialist revolution through to the end, while the other aims to preserve the old capitalist order. One aims to reform, while the other aims to preserve. This is the essence of the struggle between the two lines.

With the deepening development of the mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is further grasped by the broad masses, and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new phase. The main characteristics of this new phase are:

The broad workers and peasants have risen up. They have broken through various obstacles, established their own revolutionary organizations, and joined the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement.

The strength of revolutionary students has greatly developed, grown, and improved. Some revolutionary students have gone to factories and rural areas, beginning to combine with the worker and peasant masses.

The revolutionary cadres of party and state organs have risen up to rebel against those responsible comrades who stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line.

The scale of the mass movement has become even larger. The content of the struggle has become richer. In the workers, peasants, students, and cadres of party and state organs, more revolutionary pioneers have emerged. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party have become even more isolated.

In modern Chinese history, cultural revolution movements have always started with student movements, developed into worker and peasant movements, and developed into the combination of revolutionary intellectuals with workers and peasants. This is an objective law. The May Fourth Movement, which marked the beginning of modern Chinese revolutionary history, was like this. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which brought China's socialist revolution into a new stage, is also like this. In 1967, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will further develop according to this objective law.

In 1967, it will be a year of nationwide comprehensive class struggle.

In 1967, it will be a year when the proletariat, in alliance with other revolutionary masses, launches a general offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the ghosts and monsters in society.

In 1967, it will be a year of further deepening the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminating its influence.

In 1967, it will be a year of decisive victories in struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The main political tasks facing the whole party and the revolutionary masses in 1967 are:

First, in factories and rural areas, according to Chairman Mao and the Central Committee's instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production," carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, promote the thought reform of people, and promote the development of industrial and agricultural production.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in factories and rural areas must be conducted according to the "Sixteen Points on the Cultural Revolution." It is essential to let the masses educate themselves, liberate themselves, and rise up to make revolution. No one can take over for them. The Four Clean-ups movement must be incorporated into the Cultural Revolution, and the problems of the Four Clean-ups and the re-examination of the Four Clean-ups must be solved within the Cultural Revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in factories and rural areas is extremely important. Workers and peasants are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is necessary to mobilize the worker and peasant masses, overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party in industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas, and uproot all capitalist and revisionist old things. Only in this way can the roots of capitalist restoration be eliminated.

Chairman Mao said in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan: "Only by mobilizing the ninety percent of the population who are workers and peasants can we defeat imperialism and defeat feudalism." Similarly, today, only by "mobilizing the ninety percent of the population who are workers and peasants" can we defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and solve the problem of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must develop from organs, schools, and cultural circles to industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas, letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions. If the movement stops in organs, schools, and cultural circles, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be half-hearted.

All arguments against carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas are wrong.

Some confused people oppose revolution and production, believing that carrying out the Cultural Revolution will hinder production. Therefore, they only focus on production and not on revolution. These comrades have not considered: why do we plow fields, weave cloth, and smelt steel? Is it to build socialism or capitalism? The historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship tells us that only by carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can we ensure that our economic construction proceeds along the socialist and communist path. Many facts in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have proven that where the Cultural Revolution is well carried out, production has developed greatly. Revolution will promote the development of social productive forces and will not hinder the development of social productive forces. This is the truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

There are also a few people who, under the pretext of focusing on production, suppress the revolution. They seem to care about production, but in fact, they care about their own positions and the preservation of bourgeois old things, fearing that the revolution will reach their heads. When the masses rise up to carry out the revolution, they actually incite some temporarily deceived people to stop production to deal with the revolutionary masses. Some of them even collude with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to engage in secret activities. This exposes that they are executing the bourgeois reactionary line and that they themselves are power-holders taking the capitalist road or are about to become power-holders taking the capitalist road.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement in industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas is an irresistible historical trend. All arguments and people who obstruct this trend will be thrown into the trash by the revolutionary masses.

Second, for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in schools and various circles of culture, it is necessary to vigorously advocate that revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary intellectuals, plan and organize to go to factories and rural areas, combining with the broad worker and peasant masses.

In 1939, in his works "The May Fourth Movement" and "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," Chairman Mao pointed out:

"Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the worker and peasant masses, will achieve nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, and counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to combine with the worker and peasant masses."

"All the young intellectuals and student youth in the country must combine with the broad worker and peasant masses, becoming one with them, to form a powerful army. This is an army of tens of millions of people! With this great army, we can attack and smash the enemy's strongholds and the enemy's last bastions."

Chairman Mao here expounds a universal truth. Combining with the worker and peasant masses is the direction of the youth movement in the period of new democratic revolution and is also the direction of the youth movement in the period of socialist revolution.

Today, it is the same: "The final dividing line between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, and counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to combine with the worker and peasant masses." Only by combining with the worker and peasant masses can one truly establish a proletarian worldview and truly become a genuine proletarian intellectual.

Today, it is the same: young intellectuals and student youth must go to factories and rural areas to combine with the worker and peasant masses, becoming one with them, to organize an army of tens of millions of people, attack the positions occupied by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and achieve the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Going to factories and rural areas and struggling, criticizing, and transforming in one's own unit should be reasonably arranged. For the struggle in one's own unit in the previous period, a necessary summary should be made to further clarify the essence of the struggle between the two lines in the Cultural Revolution, distinguish right from wrong, and correct the attitude and understanding of going to factories and rural areas.

Going to factories and rural areas, one should humbly learn from the worker and peasant masses, be willing to be a small student, work and study with workers and peasants, discuss cultural revolution issues, and promote Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line while criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. One should look down, conduct in-depth investigations, and combine with the revolutionary mass organizations there, not be self-righteous, and not take over for others.

Going to factories and rural areas is an important condition for completing the struggle, criticism, and transformation tasks in one's own unit. Young students and young intellectuals, by throwing themselves into the fiery worker and peasant mass movement, will have their thoughts transformed and will be able to more powerfully struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and more clearly distinguish right from wrong in the great debate. Only when factories and rural areas thoroughly carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can the revolution in schools and various cultural circles be thoroughly completed. Only by understanding the actual situation in factories and rural areas and listening to the voices of workers and peasants can we reform the educational system, educational content, teaching methods, and effectively transform our cultural organizations and cultural work, truly and completely serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Third, fully carry forward the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This great democracy is to mobilize hundreds of millions of people under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought to launch a general offensive against the enemies of socialism and, at the same time, to criticize and supervise various levels of leading organs and leading cadres. Creating such a social atmosphere of great democracy is of great and far-reaching significance for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration.

The great democracy of the proletariat is a new development of Chairman Mao's mass line and a new form of the combination of Mao Zedong Thought with hundreds of millions of people. This great democracy is the best method for the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves. In this great democratic movement, the broad masses, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, distinguish between enemies and ourselves and between right and wrong. This great democracy is the best school for learning Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao tells us: "Democracy is sometimes seemingly a goal, but in fact, it is only a means." We use this means of great democracy to achieve the goal of carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and developing socialist undertakings. Those who deviate from the interests of the proletariat and other laboring people, deviate from socialism, and deviate from the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao will not have proletarian great democracy but only the oppression of a few people over the revolutionary masses.

The great democracy we advocate is under the concentrated guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Different opinions among the masses should be debated under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought using the method of presenting facts and reasoning, not using coercive methods to suppress others. In people's internal affairs, if only one's own opinions are allowed and different opinions are not allowed, it violates the principle of proletarian great democracy. A few malicious people incite the deceived masses to engage in armed conflicts to suppress the revolution, which is destroying the great democracy of the proletariat, destroying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and destroying the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us to practice democracy within the people and dictatorship over the reactionaries. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the guarantee for practicing the great democracy of the proletariat. The great democracy of the proletariat, in turn, is the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without the great democracy of the proletariat, the dictatorship of the proletariat will have the danger of turning into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, there will be no proletarian democracy, not to mention great democracy, even small democracy will not exist. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our proletarian dictatorship organs must resolutely and unshakably guarantee the democratic rights of the people, ensuring the normal conduct of great debates, big-character posters, great links, and great rallies. For those who have committed crimes such as murder, arson, poisoning, causing traffic accidents, secret sabotage, leaking state secrets, and engaging in sabotage activities, they must be subjected to dictatorship and punished by law. All revolutionary masses should assist and supervise our state dictatorship organs in performing the task of guaranteeing the great democracy of the proletariat. For those rightists who have reactionary thoughts but have not committed illegal acts, they should still be struggled against by the masses using the method of presenting facts and reasoning.

Fourth, continue to carry out the mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The appearance of the bourgeois reactionary line in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not accidental. Since China entered the stage of socialist revolution, there has been a struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line, a struggle between building socialism and building capitalism. Those who put forward the reactionary line in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are only further exposing their bourgeois reactionary stance.

In industrial and mining enterprises, rural areas, primary and secondary schools, cultural circles, party and government organs, and various fields, the bourgeois reactionary line must be overturned, and its influence must be eliminated, so that people can truly solve problems in their minds. We must have a clear understanding of this.

In the future, in the worker movement, peasant movement, student movement, and on various fronts of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the bourgeois reactionary line must be thoroughly criticized, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line must be firmly established. This is the key to carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The revolutionary cadres of party and government organs must break through the rules and regulations and those restrictive rules and regulations that bind the revolution, go to the masses, and together with workers, peasants, and revolutionary students, criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Through the mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our party and government organs will thoroughly realize proletarian revolutionization.

In the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, towards comrades who have made line errors, we should follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "punish the past to educate the future and cure the sickness to save the patient," achieving the two goals of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades. As for the few two-faced people who do not turn back and insist on errors, they will definitely be overthrown by the people, which is self-inflicted.

The Chinese Communist Party is great, glorious, and correct. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party are only a few people. The vast majority of party members and cadres are good and revolutionary. After this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement of testing and tempering, they will become even stronger.

The revolutionary leftist forces should, in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, raise their level, and strengthen their organization. The revolutionary leftist forces should, on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen unity. They should further learn and master Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thoughts, be good at winning over and uniting the majority, and isolate the stubborn enemies to the greatest extent. In the struggle, they should strictly distinguish between enemy contradictions and people's internal contradictions, "distinguish between anti-party and anti-socialist rightists and those who support the party and socialism but have said some wrong things, done some wrong deeds, or written some bad articles and works," and "distinguish between bourgeois reactionary academic authorities and those who have general bourgeois academic thoughts." Through the movement, ultimately, ninety-five percent of the cadres and ninety-five percent of the masses should be united.

The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the few stubborn advocates of the bourgeois reactionary line will definitely play new tricks and continue to make trouble. Like all reactionaries, "all the oppression they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." Of course, like all reactionaries, they are paper tigers. We should, as Chairman Mao teaches, despise them strategically and take them seriously tactically, and unremittingly struggle against them.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we should, with the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line as the key, combine with great debates, big-character posters, great links, and great rallies, further respond to the call of Comrade Lin Biao to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, temper and strengthen the extremely proletarianized and extremely combative revolutionary forces, and achieve one victory after another.

Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought,
The working class unites,
The working class unites with the poor and lower-middle peasants and other laborers,
All laborers unite with revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres,
All nationalities unite,
Launch a nationwide comprehensive class struggle,
Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

### 把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底

    把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    《人民日报》《红旗》杂志
    一九六六年，在我国兴起的无产阶级文化大革命，是二十世纪六十年代的最伟大的事件。这个革命，使我国的社会主义革命发展到一个新阶段。这个革命，在国际共产主义运动的历史上开辟了一个新纪元。
    在列宁领导下，伟大的十月社会主义革命，开辟了无产阶级革命的新时代。十月革命，解决了用革命暴力夺取政权，建立无产阶级专政的问题，给全世界无产阶级树立了伟大的榜样。但是，当时不可能解决社会主义国家无产阶级和资产阶级谁战胜谁，保持无产阶级政权，巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的一系列问题。十月革命的故乡，竟然出现了现代修正主义集团篡夺党和国家的领导，使得第一个社会主义国家苏联，走上资本主义复辟的道路。这个教训，说明了无产阶级夺取了政权以后，能不能保持政权，能不能防止资本主义复辟，成了国际无产阶级的一个新的中心课题。它不仅决定着无产阶级专政国家的命运，而且决定着全世界无产阶级和被压迫民族革命事业的命运。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，就是解决这个具有伟大历史意义的问题，给全世界无产阶级树立新的伟大的榜样。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是我国社会主义革命的新阶段。在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，社会上的资产阶级右派和党内的一小撮资产阶级代表人物，他们不甘心剥削制度的灭亡，不断地向无产阶级发动猖狂进攻，妄图实行资本主义复辟。在毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争学说的指导下，我们党领导无产阶级和其他革命群众，对资产阶级的挑战举行了胜利的反击。这次无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级同资产阶级和它在我们党内的代理人的一次全面的较量。
    经过激烈的阶级斗争，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，开始取得了伟大的胜利。
    一九六三年，在毛主席亲自指导下，我国进行的以戏剧改革为主要标志的文艺革命，实际上是无产阶级文化大革命的开端。
    从一九六五年十月起，毛主席亲自发动的对反党反社会主义的《海瑞罢官》的批判，对“三家村”反革命集团的批判，对旧北京市委反革命修正主义领导人的批判，为大规模的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，作了舆论准备，打开了道路。
    一九六六年六月一日，毛主席决定发表北京大学的全国第一张马列主义的大字报，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，掀起了一个以打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为重点的群众运动。一批走资本主义道路的当权派，资产阶级反动学术“权威”，被揭露了出来，群众把他们斗得威风扫地。我们国家的政治生活、社会面貌、人们的精神状态，发生了深刻的变化。在这个伟大的群众运动中，涌现出了一大批勇敢的革命闯将。
    革命的道路是曲折的。正当亿万群众在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，自觉起来闹革命的时候，有一两个或几个在中央做工作的负责人，乘毛主席不在北京的机会，抛出了资产阶级反动路线，反对毛主席的正确路线。他们和那些坚决执行资产阶级反动路线的负责人，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，在他们暂时力所能及的范围内，实行资产阶级专政，力图将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去。这些人，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气。
    正在这样的关键时刻，我们的伟大舵手毛主席亲自主持召开了党的八届十一中全会，制定了《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，深刻地揭露了资产阶级反动路线。这条反动路线，包庇党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，跟他们同流合污，镇压革命的群众运动，跟革命群众作对，归根到底，是要把中国引向资本主义复辟。
    党的八届十一中全会，宣告了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的失败，把无产阶级文化大革命引到正确的轨道上来。这是毛泽东思想在社会主义革命道路上的一个新的伟大胜利。
    八届十一中全会之后，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同广大群众的革命热情相结合，就出现了对资产阶级反动路线的群众性的批判，出现了无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮。这个新高潮的重要标志，就是红卫兵运动和革命大串连。
    红卫兵是无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的新事物。六七月间，红卫兵刚出现，只有几十个人，当时被提出资产阶级反动路线的人诬蔑为“反动组织”，遭到了打击和围攻。而伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席，一发现红卫兵这样的新事物，就立即看到它的无限的生命力，歌颂它的无产阶级的革命造反精神，给予坚决的热烈的支持。毛主席的声音，像一声春雷，在极短的时间内，红卫兵在全国各学校和许多工厂、农村发展起来了，成为一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。学校的斗、批、改发展到社会上的斗、批、改。革命的红卫兵，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新。他们站在批判资产阶级反动路线的前头。他们起了先锋作用。
    革命大串连，也是无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的新事物，也是伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席支持和倡导的。革命师生在全国范围的大串连，把全国的无产阶级文化大革命运动连成一片。革命大串连，在全国传播毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，组织无产阶级的革命队伍，有力地冲击了资产阶级反动路线。
    但是，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，并不甘心自己的失败。资产阶级反动路线有它的社会基础，这主要是资产阶级，还有一批没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。资产阶级反动路线在党内也有一定的市场，这就是一些世界观没有改造或没有改造好的干部。极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，利用这条反动路线的社会基础和它在党内的影响，兴风作浪。他们使用阴一套、阳一套的种种手段，对抗无产阶级革命路线，破坏广大革命群众对资产阶级反动路线的批判。
    极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，最重要的阴谋诡计，就是挑动群众斗群众。他们暗中组织和操纵一些受他们蒙蔽的群众和群众组织，压制革命，保护自己，挑起武斗，企图制造混乱。他们还散布谣言，颠倒黑白，把他们暗中所做的这些坏事，加在无产阶级革命派的头上，给革命派戴上“资产阶级反动路线”的帽子。他们继续妄图把斗争的矛头，指向革命群众，指向无产阶级革命路线，指向无产阶级的革命司令部。
    正当我们党按照毛主席的阶级路线，组织无产阶级文化革命队伍的时候，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，却利用“老子英雄儿好汉，老子反动儿混蛋”这个口号，蛊惑一批学生，制造宗派，搅乱阶级阵线。这个口号，开始是一些天真的青年人提出来的，他们由于思想方法上的某些片面性，从反对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派排斥和打击革命干部子女、工农子女这个正确前提出发，走到了另一个极端。对于这些天真的青年，应该循循善诱地引导他们。我们党，当时就是这样做的。顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，却别有用心地利用这个口号，欺骗极少数学生（其中有些是没有教育好的干部子女），要把他们引上邪路，来同另一部分学生闹对立。这样一来，“老子英雄儿好汉，老子反动儿混蛋”这个口号，就成了对抗无产阶级革命路线的东西。应当指出，别有用心的人，利用这个口号，实质上是宣扬剥削阶级的反动的血统论。封建地主阶级宣扬什么“龙生龙，凤生凤，老鼠生儿打地洞”，就是这样的血统论。它是彻头彻尾反动的历史唯心主义。
    极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，不但不向群众检讨，不给被他们打成“反革命”、“反党分子”、“假左派、真右派”、“伸手派”等等的革命群众平反，不肯当众销毁那些整革命群众的材料，反而大肆宣扬“秋后算账论”，扬言还要把革命群众当作“右派”处理。这种论调，就是要反攻倒算。无产阶级革命派是不怕算账的。“秋后算账论”是吓不倒革命群众的。散布这种论调的人，又对党、对革命群众欠下了一笔新账。革命群众对于他们的这笔账，是一定要算的。
    极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，他们这些形形色色的表演，恰好暴露了他们自己。他们闹得越凶，就越使广大群众认识到什么叫资产阶级反动路线，认识到非起来揭露和批判这条资产阶级反动路线不可。
    这些坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，为什么在一个时候能够蒙蔽一些群众呢？这是因为，他们利用毛主席和党在群众中的崇高威信，他们贪天之功，据为己有，把自己说成是党的化身，把自己的言行说成是党的领导，把相信党说成是相信他们自己。他们还特别宣扬这样一种论调，就是要人们不讲原则、无条件地服从直接上级领导。这种论调，实际上是提倡盲从，提倡奴隶主义，而反对马克思列宁主义、反对毛泽东思想的。
    早在一九四二年整风运动，从思想上解决王明路线问题的时候，毛主席就指出：
    “共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”
    毛主席经常教导我们：危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。事实上，在这次文化大革命中，广大革命师生及革命干部对于错误的领导，就广泛地进行过抵制。
    坚决接受和执行马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的正确领导，坚决抵制危害革命的错误领导，坚决反对奴隶主义，这是以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级政党的政治原则，也是组织原则。一切真正的共产党员，都应当坚决地、不折不扣地、无所畏惧地按照这个原则办事，并且正确地向群众宣传这个原则。这个原则，为广大革命群众和广大革命干部所掌握，那些顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就会被缴了械。
    八届十一中全会到现在，已经四个多月了。毛主席和他的战友们，对犯了路线错误的同志，做了许多政治思想工作，广大革命群众也对他们进行了批评和教育。有些同志已经改正了错误，有些同志正在改正错误。这是应该受到欢迎的。对于那些还不肯改正错误的人，应当大喝一声：必须悬崖勒马！如果他们继续坚持资产阶级反动路线，对党对群众玩弄两面手法，那就要同走资本主义道路的当权派合流了，或者证明他们自己本来就是走资本主义道路的当权派。
    这次两条路线的斗争是非常深刻的。几个月来开展的批判资产阶级反动路线的群众运动，获得了极大的胜利，使得亿万群众懂得了这场斗争的实质。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，要放手发动群众，斗垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，革除一切剥削阶级的旧东西。而资产阶级反动路线，则要压制群众，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，保护一切剥削阶级的旧东西。一个要把社会主义革命进行到底，一个要保存资本主义旧秩序，一个要革，一个要保，这就是两条路线斗争的实质。
    随着对资产阶级反动路线的群众性批判的深入发展，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线进一步为广大群众所掌握，我国无产阶级文化大革命出现了一个新局面。这个新局面的主要特点就是：
    广大的工人、农民起来了。他们冲破各种阻力，建立自己的革命组织，投入了无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    革命学生的力量有了很大的发展、壮大和提高。有些革命学生走到工厂，走到农村，开始同工农群众相结合。
    党和国家机关的革命干部，起来造那些顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的负责人的反。
    群众运动的规模更大了。斗争的内容更丰富了。在工人中，农民中，学生中，机关干部中，涌现出了更多的革命闯将。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，更加孤立了。
    我国现代史上的文化革命运动，都是从学生运动开始，发展为工人运动和农民运动，发展为革命的知识分子同工人农民相结合。这是客观的规律。作为我国现代革命史开端的五四运动是这样，使我国社会主义革命进入一个新阶段的无产阶级文化大革命运动，也是这样。一九六七年，我国的无产阶级文化大革命将按照这个客观规律进一步地展开。
    一九六七年，将是全国全面展开阶级斗争的一年。
    一九六七年，将是无产阶级联合其他革命群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，展开总攻击的一年。
    一九六七年，将是更加深入地批判资产阶级反动路线，清除它的影响的一年。
    一九六七年，将是一斗、二批、三改取得决定性的胜利的一年。
    一九六七年，提到全党和全国革命群众面前的政治任务，主要是：
    第一，在工厂和农村中，要根据毛主席和党中央“抓革命，促生产”的指示，大搞无产阶级文化大革命，促进人的思想革命化，推动工农业生产的发展。
    工厂和农村的无产阶级文化大革命，都要按照文化革命的十六条办事，坚持让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，自己起来闹革命，任何人不能包办代替。四清运动要纳入文化大革命中去，在文化大革命中，解决四清问题和四清复查问题。
    工厂和农村的无产阶级文化大革命，是极其重要的。工人和农民，是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。必须放手发动工农群众，斗垮工矿企业和农村党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，铲除一切资本主义和修正主义的旧东西。只有这样，才能把资本主义复辟的根子挖掉。
    毛主席在抗日战争初期说过：“只有动员占全国人口百分之九十的工农大众，才能战胜帝国主义，才能战胜封建主义”。同样，在今天，只有“动员占全国人口百分之九十的工农大众”，才能战胜党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才能解决无产阶级和资产阶级谁战胜谁的问题。
    无产阶级文化大革命一定要从机关里、学校里和文化各界里，发展到工矿企业和农村，让毛泽东思想去占领一切阵地。如果运动停留在机关、学校和文化各界里，无产阶级文化大革命就会半途而废。
    一切抵制在工矿企业和农村中大搞无产阶级文化革命的论调，都是错误的。
    有些糊涂人，把革命和生产对立起来，认为一搞文化大革命就要妨碍生产。因此，他们只抓生产，不抓革命。这些同志没有想一想，种田、织布、炼钢是为了什么？是要搞社会主义还是要搞资本主义？国际无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们，只有搞好无产阶级文化大革命，才能保证我们的经济建设沿着社会主义、共产主义道路前进。无产阶级文化大革命中出现的许多事实证明，凡是文化革命搞得好的地方，生产就有了很大的发展。革命只会促进社会生产力的发展，而不会妨碍社会生产力的发展，这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理。
    还有极少数人，他们借口抓生产来压制革命。他们表面上关心生产，其实他们关心的是自己的乌纱帽，是保存资产阶级的旧东西，害怕革命革到自己的头上来。当着群众起来大搞革命的时候，他们竟然挑动一些暂时受他们蒙蔽的人，停止生产，来对付革命群众。其中有的人，甚至同地、富、反、坏、右勾结起来，进行不可告人的勾当。这恰好暴露了他们执行的是资产阶级反动路线，甚至他们自己就是走资本主义道路的当权派，或者是快要成为走资本主义道路的当权派。
    工矿企业和农村中的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，是不可阻挡的历史潮流。一切阻挡这个潮流的论调，一切阻挡这个潮流的人，都将被革命群众送到垃圾堆里去。
    第二，对于学校里和文化领域各界里的无产阶级文化大革命，要大力提倡革命师生、革命知识分子，有计划、有组织地到工厂去，到农村去，实行和广大工农群众相结合。
    毛主席在一九三九年发表的《五四运动》和《青年运动的方向》里指出：
    “知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”
    “全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块，和他们变成一体，才能形成一支强有力的军队。这是一支几万万人的军队呵！有了这支大军，才能攻破敌人的坚固阵地，才能攻破敌人的最后堡垒。”
    毛主席在这里阐述的是一个普遍真理。和工农群众相结合，是新民主主义革命时期青年运动的方向，也是社会主义革命时期青年运动的方向。
    在今天，也是这样：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”只有和工农群众相结合，才能真正树立无产阶级世界观，才能真正成为一个名副其实的无产阶级知识分子。
    在今天，也是这样：知识青年、学生青年要下厂下乡，去和工农群众相结合，和他们变成一体，才能组织起几万万人的大军，攻破那些被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派盘踞的阵地，取得无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利。
    下厂下乡和本单位斗、批、改，要作合理的安排。对于前一段本单位的斗争，要作必要的总结，进一步明确文化大革命中两条路线斗争的实质，分清大是大非，端正下厂下乡的态度和认识。
    下厂下乡，要虚心向工农群众学习，甘当小学生，同工人农民一起劳动，一起学习，一起讨论文化革命问题，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，批判资产阶级反动路线。要眼睛向下，深入进行调查研究，和那里的革命群众组织相结合，不要自以为是，不要包办代替。
    下厂下乡是完成本单位斗、批、改任务的重要条件。青年学生、青年知识分子，投到火热的工农群众运动中去，使自己的思想得到改造，就能更有力地斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就能更明确地认清大辩论中的是非。只有工厂、农村彻底实现了无产阶级文化大革命，属于上层建筑的学校和文化各界的革命才能彻底完成。只有了解工厂、农村的实际，听取工人和农民的声音，才能切合实际地改革教育制度，教育内容，教学方法，才能有效地改造我们的文化团体和文化工作，真正地完全地做到为工农兵服务。
    第三，充分发扬无产阶级专政条件下的大民主。这种大民主，就是在毛泽东思想统帅下，发动亿万群众，向社会主义的敌人举行总攻击，同时也是对各级领导机关和领导干部进行批评和监督。造成这样一种大民主的社会风气，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，具有重大的深远的意义。
    无产阶级大民主，是毛主席的群众路线的新发展，是毛泽东思想同亿万群众相结合的新形式。这种大民主，是群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的最好的方法。广大群众在这种大民主运动中，以毛泽东思想为武器，分清敌我，分清是非。这种大民主，是学习毛泽东思想的最好的学校。
    毛主席告诉我们：“民主这个东西，有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段。”我们运用大民主这个手段，要达到的目的，是实现无产阶级文化大革命，发展社会主义事业。背离了无产阶级和其他劳动人民的利益，背离了社会主义，背离了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就不可能有无产阶级的大民主，而只能是少数人对革命群众的压迫。
    我们提倡的大民主，是在毛泽东思想集中指导下的大民主。群众之间的不同意见，要在毛泽东思想指导下，用摆事实、讲道理的方法进行辩论，而不能用强制的办法压制别人。在人民内部，如果只允许自己发表意见，不允许别人发表不同意见，那就违背了无产阶级大民主的原则。极少数别有用心的坏人，挑动被他们蒙蔽的群众进行武斗，来压制革命，这是破坏无产阶级的大民主，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，也是破坏无产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们，在人民内部实行民主，对反动派实行专政。无产阶级专政，是实行无产阶级大民主的保障。无产阶级大民主，又是巩固无产阶级专政的。没有无产阶级大民主，无产阶级专政就有变成资产阶级专政的危险。没有无产阶级专政，就没有无产阶级的民主，不用说大民主，连小民主也不会有。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们的无产阶级专政机构，必须坚决地毫不动摇地保证人民民主权利，保证大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的正常进行。对于确有证据的杀人、放火、放毒、制造交通事故进行暗害、里通外国、盗窃国家机密、搞破坏活动等现行反革命分子，必须实行专政，依法制裁。一切革命群众，都应当协助和监督我们国家的专政机构，执行保障无产阶级大民主的任务。对于那些思想反动、但没有违法行为的右派分子，还是要由群众用摆事实、讲道理的方法，同他们进行斗争。
    第四，继续开展对资产阶级反动路线的群众性的批判。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中出现资产阶级反动路线，绝不是偶然的。从我国进入社会主义革命阶段以来，就存在着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的斗争，存在着是搞社会主义还是搞资本主义的斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命中提出反动路线的人，只是进一步地暴露了他们的资产阶级反动立场。
    在工矿企业，在农村，在大中小学和文化各界里，在党政机关，在各个领域内，反掉资产阶级反动路线，并且清除它的影响，使人们真正从思想上解决问题，还要做许多深入细致的工作。对于这一点，我们必须有清醒的认识。
    今后，在无产阶级文化大革命的工人运动中，农民运动中，学生运动中，在各个战线上，都要大破资产阶级反动路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的关键。
    党政机关的革命干部，要打破清规戒律和那些束缚革命的条条框框，到群众中去，同工人、农民和革命学生一起批判资产阶级反动路线，斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。通过无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，使我们的党政机关，彻底实现无产阶级的革命化。
    在批判资产阶级反动路线当中，对待犯路线错误的同志，要根据毛主席的教导，“实行惩前毖后、治病救人的方针，借以达到既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的。”至于极少数不肯回头，坚持错误，阳奉阴违的两面派，他们一定会被人民群众打倒，那是咎由自取。
    中国共产党是伟大的、光荣的、正确的。党内走资本主义道路的当权派，只是一小撮人。绝大多数党员和干部是好的，是要革命的，经过这次无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的考验和锻炼，将更加坚强起来。
    革命的左派队伍，要在批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，努力活学活用毛主席著作，进行提高和整顿。革命的左派队伍，要在毛泽东思想基础上加强团结。要进一步学习和掌握毛主席的战略和策略思想，善于争取和团结大多数，把顽固的敌人最大限度地孤立起来。在斗争中要严格区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，“注意把反党反社会主义的右派分子，同拥护党和社会主义、但也说过一些错话，做过一些错事或写过一些不好文章不好作品的人，严格区别开来”，“注意把资产阶级的反动学阀、反动‘权威’，同具有一般的资产阶级学术思想的人，严格区别开来”。经过运动，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，一定还要玩弄新的花样，继续捣乱。同一切反动派一样，“他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”当然，同一切反动派一样，他们也是纸老虎。我们要像毛主席教导的那样，在战略上藐视他们，在战术上重视他们，坚持不懈地同他们进行斗争。
    我们要在无产阶级文化大革命中，以无产阶级同资产阶级的阶级斗争、社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争、无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的斗争为纲，结合大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，进一步响应高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的林彪同志的号召，开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，锻炼和壮大非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命队伍，夺取一个又一个的新胜利。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，
    工人阶级联合起来，
    工人阶级同贫下中农和其他劳动者联合起来，
    一切劳动者同革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部联合起来，
    各族人民联合起来，
    展开全国全面的阶级斗争，
    把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！
