Under the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary masses advance with high spirits and sweep away economism. They implement the "Urgent Notice," smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 17th - The "Urgent Notice" of the 32 revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, personally decided by our great leader Chairman Mao to be broadcast nationwide, has received the most enthusiastic response and most resolute support from the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses on various fronts in Shanghai. In recent days, the broad revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses, armed with this important document, have launched the most resolute struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn individuals who persistently adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line. They have dealt a fatal blow to the revisionist economism, and the battle to counter the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line in the entire city has achieved new victories.

Due to the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers on the industrial, financial, and commercial fronts strictly implementing the "Urgent Notice," they have gradually suppressed the evil wind of revisionist economism. The broad revolutionary masses have carried out an unprecedented large-scale unity, exposing and criticizing this evil wind thoroughly. Currently, the overall situation of the struggle in the city has greatly improved: the "harbor strike" conspiracy fabricated by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and a few stubborn individuals who persistently adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line has been completely foiled. The dock areas that had stopped working to handle foreign ships have resumed normal loading and unloading operations; the situation of railway transportation has improved rapidly, and passenger and freight transportation on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines have started to flow smoothly; the chaos brought to finance and the market by the economism black wind has been basically stopped; power, tap water, gas, trams, and many other factory and enterprise units have overcome the serious difficulties brought to production by the economism black wind, ensuring the normal progress of production work. Many deceived workers have voluntarily returned the money they received; many workers who left their posts to travel for revolutionary activities have also returned to their factories to participate in production. Under the policy guidance fully reflecting the great thought of Mao Zedong as stipulated in the "Urgent Notice," the revolutionary masses have seen the light, and their awareness has been raised. Economism—this piece of junk picked from the garbage heap of revisionism—is increasingly despised by people.

The "Urgent Notice" issued by the 32 revolutionary mass organizations has enabled the broad revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses to timely expose the new conspiracy played by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn individuals who persistently adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line. The telegram of congratulations sent by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai has further clarified the direction of the struggle, inspiring the revolutionary masses to fight against economism and smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. They enthusiastically praise the "Urgent Notice" as timely and appropriate; they believe that the policies stipulated in the "Urgent Notice" fully reflect Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the correct policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed by Chairman Mao. The Revolutionary Rebel Committee of the Shanghai Half-Work Half-Study Universities, upon seeing the "Urgent Notice," immediately issued an urgent appeal to all revolutionary teachers and students in the city, urging them to take immediate action, widely carry out propaganda activities, thoroughly expose the tricks played by a handful of reactionaries with economism; at the same time, they demand that everyone firmly stand on the side of the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels, be prepared at any time to participate in production, and under the command of the workers' revolutionary rebels, take over the shifts of the workers' militias who have temporarily left their production posts due to being deceived, and resolutely repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. A part of the masses in the supply and marketing system of Nanhui County were previously deceived by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Supply and Marketing Cooperative and went to other places to travel. After the revolutionary rebels in the supply and marketing system read the "Urgent Notice," they immediately ordered those who had gone out not to be deceived by a handful of reactionaries and to quickly return to participate in the Cultural Revolution and production. Many factory and enterprise units' workers' rebel brigades and other revolutionary rebel organizations have been broadcasting the content of the "Urgent Notice" continuously in recent days and writing it on big-character posters for widespread propaganda. The revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses of the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory and the Shanghai Shipyard also held meetings to expose the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, making everyone see the ugly face of a handful of leaders in the factory who signed documents, made promises, and distributed money randomly, using economism and material incentives to corrupt and poison the workers, aiming to achieve the evil purpose of disrupting production and the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary workers solemnly swore at the meeting to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

Under the encouragement of the central telegram, the revolutionary rebel workers and the broad revolutionary masses in the entire city have quickly taken action, strictly implementing the "Urgent Notice," and launching a powerful counterattack against the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, determined to thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionist economism. Part of the workers of the Sixth Fleet of the Shanghai Inland Waterway Transportation Company, operating in the inland waterways of Shanghai and Suzhou, were once deceived by a handful of stubborn individuals who persistently adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line and left the ship to pursue economic benefits, causing more than half of the fleet's ships to stop sailing. The revolutionary rebels of this fleet resolutely implemented the "Urgent Notice," and under extremely difficult conditions, through in-depth and detailed ideological work, united the revolutionary masses, and took over the transportation business, making the tugboats that had stopped sailing on January 10th tow a long string of barges again and resume sailing on the Huangpu River. The temporary workers and outsourced workers of the Red Workers' Rebel Brigade of the Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory had previously been approved by the factory to receive back pay of 30,000 yuan. When they realized that this was a new conspiracy played by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Municipal Party Committee and stubborn individuals who persistently adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, they all said angrily: "We must carry forward the spirit of the working class, not be confused by money, and not fall into the enemy's trap." They immediately stated that they would not take a single cent of the money approved by the factory and took revolutionary action to freeze the factory's cash. Fourteen revolutionary apprentices in the Mechanical Department of the Shanghai Fifth Dyeing Factory were previously prepared to leave the factory to travel. After reading the two important documents "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and "Urgent Notice," they saw things more clearly and realized that a handful of people agreeing to let them go to other places to travel was a trick, aiming to use the "remove the tiger from the mountain" tactic to lure away this group of revolutionary young fighters who dared to speak, dare to do, and dare to pioneer in the Cultural Revolution, to shift the target of the struggle and disperse revolutionary forces. After exposing this conspiracy, they resolutely did not go out, firmly guarded their production posts, and insisted on carrying out the Cultural Revolution within the factory. Many revolutionary rebel workers and revolutionary masses in units such as the Shanghai Cigarette Factory, the Fourth Silk Factory, the Wutong Thermal Power Plant, and the Sugar and Tobacco Company's Yangshupu Wholesale Department have also returned the back pay, allowances, and travel expenses they had received to the state. They said: "Rebelling is for revolution, not for a few dollars; if we fall for the sugar-coated bullets, we will not be able to rebel firmly." They said: "If we fall for economism, do not engage in political struggle, our country will change color, and our children and grandchildren will suffer the hardships we once suffered."

The economism black wind blown by the bourgeois reactionary line has once again educated the broad masses from the opposite side. The fighting spirit of the revolutionary rebels is even higher, and some deceived masses have also awakened and joined the struggle to counter the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. They all pointed out: every time revolutionary fighters capture a fortress, they will encounter the frenzied resistance of the class enemy; every step forward in the revolution, the enemy will play new tricks. However, Chairman Mao teaches us: "When dark clouds appear in the sky, we point out: this is only a temporary phenomenon, darkness will soon pass, and dawn is just ahead." We revolutionary rebels are full of confidence in victory, dare to face and sweep away all kinds of new obstacles and new barriers on the road of revolution. We must unite more closely, act more quickly, thoroughly repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and make the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    在毛主席和党中央的伟大号召下斗志昂扬乘胜前进 
    上海无产阶级革命派大联合横扫经济主义 
    贯彻执行《紧急通告》，粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑
    新华社上海十七日电　我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定向全国广播的上海市三十二个革命造反组织的《紧急通告》，获得了上海市各条战线革命造反派和革命群众最最热烈的响应和最最坚决的支持。连日来，广大革命造反派和革命群众，以《紧急通告》这一重要文件为武器，同一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，展开了最坚决的斗争，给了反革命修正主义的经济主义以致命的打击。全市反击资产阶级反动路线新反扑的战斗，取得了新的胜利。
    由于工交、财贸各条战线的革命造反派和革命职工不折不扣地贯彻执行《紧急通告》，已经逐步把反革命修正主义的经济主义的阴风压下去。广大革命群众实行了空前规模的大联合，纷纷起来对这股阴风进行彻底的揭露和批判。目前，全市整个斗争局面已经大为改观：上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人一手制造的“海港停工”大阴谋彻底破产了，一度停工的停泊外轮的各装卸区，都已恢复正常的装卸工作；铁路运输情况迅速好转，沪宁、沪杭两线的客货运输开始畅通；经济主义黑风给金融、市场带来的某些混乱现象，基本上已被制止；发电、自来水、煤气、电车和其他许许多多工厂企业单位，战胜了经济主义黑风恶浪给生产上带来的严重困难，保证了生产工作的正常进行。不少受蒙蔽的职工，自觉地退出了领到的臭钱；不少离开工作岗位外出串连的职工，也已陆续返回工厂参加生产……。在充分体现了伟大的毛泽东思想的《紧急通告》中所规定的政策指引下，革命群众眼睛亮了，认识提高了。经济主义——这个从修正主义垃圾堆里拣来的破烂货，越来越受到人们的唾弃。
    三十二个革命群众组织发出的《紧急通告》，使广大革命造反派和革命群众及时识破了一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人玩弄的新阴谋。中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体发来的贺电，进一步指明了斗争的方向，激发起广大革命群众反对经济主义、粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的战斗热情。他们热烈赞扬《紧急通告》来得好，来得及时；他们认为《紧急通告》所规定的政策，完全体现了毛主席的革命路线和毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的正确方针。上海市半工半读大专院校革命造反委员会看到《紧急通告》以后，立即向全市半工半读革命师生发出紧急呼吁，要求他们立即行动起来，广泛开展宣传活动，彻底戳穿一小撮反动分子玩弄的经济主义鬼把戏；同时要求大家坚决站在上海工人革命造反派一边，随时做好准备，以便在必要时参加生产，在工人革命造反派的指挥下，把由于受到蒙蔽而暂离生产岗位的工人赤卫队队员的班顶起来，坚决打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。南汇县供销系统的一部分群众，前一时期受了上海市供销社党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的蒙蔽，领了串连费到外地去串连。供销系统的革命造反派读到《紧急通告》后，也立即通令外出人员不要上一小撮反动家伙的当，迅速回来参加文化大革命和搞好生产。许多工厂和企业单位的工人造反大队和其他革命造反组织，连日来把《紧急通告》的内容连续进行广播，并且写成大字报张贴，广泛进行宣传。上海汽轮机厂和上海造船厂的革命造反派工人和革命群众，还分别举行了揭发资产阶级反动路线新反扑的大会，使大家看清了厂里一小撮当权派乱签字、乱许愿、乱发钱，用经济主义、物质刺激来腐蚀、毒害工人，借以达到破坏生产、破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的的丑恶面目。革命职工在会上庄严宣誓，坚决贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    在中央贺电的鼓舞下，全市革命造反派职工和广大革命群众，迅速地行动起来，不折不扣地贯彻执行《紧急通告》，对资产阶级反动路线的新反扑进行有力的反击，决心彻底清除反革命修正主义的经济主义的流毒。航行于上海、苏南地区内河的上海市内河航运公司第六船队部分工人，在一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的诱惑下，一度离船去搞经济福利，造成了全队一半以上船只停航的严重情况。这个船队的革命造反派坚决贯彻执行《紧急通告》，在极其困难的条件下，通过深入细致的思想工作，团结革命群众，顶起了航运业务，使一度停航的拖轮在本月十日，又拖带起长串驳船，在黄浦江上恢复航行。上海建筑机械制造厂红色工人革命造反大队的临时工、外包工，前一时期已由厂方签字同意发给补发工资三万元。当他们识破了这是市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人玩弄的新阴谋时，他们都很气愤地说：“我们要发扬工人阶级的硬骨头精神，决不为金钱所迷惑，决不上敌人的当。”他们当即表示，对厂方签字同意发给的钱分文不取，并且采取革命行动，冻结了厂里的现金。上海第五印染厂机动部有十四位革命艺徒，在一小撮人的蒙蔽下，本来准备离开工厂外出串连，他们读了《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》两个重要文件，站得高了，看得远了，认识到一小撮人同意他们到外地去串连，这是一个鬼花招，目的是要用“调虎离山”之计，把他们这一批在文化大革命中敢说、敢干、敢闯的革命小将骗走，来转移斗争的目标，分散革命的力量。识破了这一阴谋以后，他们就坚决不出去，坚守生产岗位，坚持搞好厂内的文化大革命。上海卷烟厂、第四印绸厂、吴泾热电厂、糖业烟酒公司杨树浦批发部等单位的许多革命造反派职工和革命群众，都把已经领到的补发工资、津贴和串连费退还给国家。他们说：“造反为革命，不是为了几个钱；中了糖衣炮弹，革命造反就硬不起来。”他们说：“如果我们上了经济主义的当，不搞政治斗争，我们国家就要变颜色，我们子子孙孙就要吃我们过去吃过的苦。”
    资产阶级反动路线刮起的经济主义黑风，又一次从反面教育了广大群众，革命造反派斗志更加高昂，一些受蒙蔽的群众也纷纷醒悟过来，投入了反击资产阶级反动路线新反扑的斗争。他们一致指出：革命战士每夺取一个堡垒，都会遇到阶级敌人的疯狂反抗；革命每前进一步，敌人都要耍出新的花招。但是，毛主席教导我们：“当着天空中出现乌云的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头。”我们广大革命造反派充满必胜的信心，敢于迎击和扫除革命前进道路上形形色色的新阻力、新障碍。我们一定要更紧密地联合起来，更迅速地行动起来，彻底打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，使无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进！
