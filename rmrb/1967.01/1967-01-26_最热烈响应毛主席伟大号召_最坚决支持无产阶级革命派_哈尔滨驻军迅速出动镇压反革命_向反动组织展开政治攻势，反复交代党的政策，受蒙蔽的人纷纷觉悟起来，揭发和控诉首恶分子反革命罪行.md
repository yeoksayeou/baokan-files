Most enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, most resolutely supporting the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. The Harbin garrison swiftly mobilizes to suppress counter-revolutionaries. Launching a political offensive against reactionary organizations, repeatedly explaining the party's policies, those who were deceived begin to awaken, exposing and denouncing the chief culprits' counter-revolutionary crimes.

	New China News Agency, January 25th: According to a report from the *Liberation Army Daily*, the Harbin garrison's certain unit most enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call and most resolutely supported the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. At the critical moment when the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat were under attack by reactionary organizations, they immediately mobilized and firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, suppressing the chief culprits of the counter-revolutionary organization. This action greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, severely crushed the arrogance of the counter-revolutionaries, and was warmly praised by the red rebels and the revolutionary masses of Harbin. People cheered: Long live the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat! Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!

	On the evening of January 23rd, around 10 PM, a counter-revolutionary incident occurred in Harbin, orchestrated by the so-called "Honor Restoration Army," a reactionary organization. That afternoon, the leader of the so-called "Honor Restoration Army" lured their members and some uninformed masses to the Youth Palace under the pretense of watching an art performance. They plotted and spread rumors, deceiving and misleading the masses. After the performance, they immediately rallied about 300 people, armed with iron bars, clubs, steel whips, daggers, and other weapons, and stormed the Friendship Palace to attack the revolutionary rebel organization of the proletariat—the Red Rebel Corps.

	Upon hearing the news, the certain unit of the Harbin garrison immediately mobilized. They followed Chairman Mao's great instructions that the People's Liberation Army must firmly support and assist the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, and were determined to support the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat with actual actions, and to severely strike down the counter-revolutionaries. They dispatched troops to quickly arrive at the scene, surrounding the Friendship Palace, and notified the municipal public security organs and the Red Rebel United Headquarters about the incident. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and boundless love for the revolutionary masses, the officers and soldiers bravely and intelligently surrounded the so-called "Honor Restoration Army" that had rushed into the Red Rebel Corps headquarters, suppressing the counter-revolutionary arrogance of a small handful of people, seizing their various weapons, and gathering them in the Friendship Palace auditorium.

	Subsequently, the certain unit of the garrison, together with the municipal public security takeover committee and the responsible persons of the Red Rebel United Headquarters, launched a political offensive against the so-called "Honor Restoration Army," repeatedly explaining the party's policies, and calling on those who were deceived to awaken immediately and expose the chief culprits. After a series of political work, those who were deceived began to awaken and exposed the chief culprits of this incident one by one. The scene of the counter-revolutionary incident turned into a mass meeting to denounce the crimes of the counter-revolutionaries. Many people cried, asking Chairman Mao for forgiveness, and exposed the leaders of the so-called "Honor Restoration Army" one by one. Finally, the municipal public security bureau arrested the chief culprits who instigated this incident according to law.

	The news of the People's Liberation Army resolutely supporting the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat quickly spread throughout Harbin. The red rebels and the revolutionary masses, upon hearing this news, were deeply moved and jubilant. They excitedly said: This is Chairman Mao giving us support. The People's Liberation Army is truly a good army educated by Chairman Mao. With the People's Liberation Army as our strong backing, we fear nothing. We will defend the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao with our lives, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and forever be the red warriors of Chairman Mao!

    新华社二十五日讯　《解放军报》消息：哈尔滨市驻军某部，最热烈地响应毛主席的伟大号召，最坚决地支持无产阶级革命派。在无产阶级革命造反派遭到反动组织围攻的紧急关头，他们立即出动，坚决地站在无产阶级革命造反派一边，镇压了反革命组织的首恶分子。这一行动，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了反革命分子的威风，受到哈尔滨市红色造反者和广大革命群众的热烈赞扬。人们欢呼：无产阶级文化大革命万岁！无产阶级专政万岁！伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    一月二十三日晚十时左右，在哈尔滨市发生了一起由反革命分子把持的所谓“荣复军”这个反动组织策划的反革命事件。这天下午，所谓“荣复军”这个反动组织的头子，以招待看文艺节目为名，把所属成员和一些不明真相的群众，骗到了青年宫。他们耍阴谋，造谣言，欺骗蒙蔽群众。看完节目后，随即纠集了三百余人，手持铁棒、木棍、钢丝鞭、匕首等凶器，闯到友谊宫，袭击无产阶级革命造反派组织——红色造反团。
    哈尔滨市驻军某部闻讯后，一声令下，干部战士立即行动。他们遵照毛主席关于人民解放军必须坚决支持和援助无产阶级革命派的伟大教导，决心以实际行动支持无产阶级革命造反派，狠狠地打击反革命分子。他们一面出动部队，火速赶到现场，包围了友谊宫；一面把这件事通知了市公安机关和红色造反者联合总部。干部战士怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限忠诚、对革命群众无限热爱的心情，勇猛机智，迅速把冲进红色造反团总部的所谓“荣复军”围住，压倒了一小撮人的反革命气焰，缴下了他们手中的各种凶器，并把他们集中在友谊宫会场内。
    接着，驻军某部协同市公安接管委员会和市红色造反者联合总部的负责人，向所谓“荣复军”展开了政治攻势，反复交代了党的政策，号召那些受蒙蔽的人立刻醒悟，起来揭露首恶分子。经过一系列的政治工作，那些受蒙蔽的人开始觉悟过来，纷纷揭发这次事件的首恶分子。反革命肇事的现场，变成了控诉反革命分子罪行的大会。许多人哭着向毛主席请罪，把所谓“荣复军”的头目一个个地揪了出来。最后，市公安局依法逮捕了发动这次事件的首恶分子。
    人民解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命造反派的消息，迅速传遍了哈尔滨市。红色造反者和广大革命群众，听到这个消息后，心情激动，欢欣鼓舞。他们兴奋地说：这是毛主席给我们撑腰。解放军真是毛主席教育出来的好军队。有解放军做我们坚强的后盾，我们什么也不怕。我们要誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，永远忠于毛主席，永远做毛主席的红色战士！
