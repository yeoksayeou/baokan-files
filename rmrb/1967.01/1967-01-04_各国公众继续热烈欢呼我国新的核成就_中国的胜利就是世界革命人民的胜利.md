People around the world continue to enthusiastically cheer and congratulate China's new nuclear explosion success.

The People's Daily reports: People around the world continue to enthusiastically cheer and congratulate China's new nuclear explosion success.

Leaders from various sectors of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic government visited the Chinese Embassy and Economic Representative Office in Vietnam before and after the New Year to express their congratulations on China's new nuclear explosion success.

Those who went to congratulate included: Chen Youyi, Minister of the State Council of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic, Chen Dayi, Chairman of the State Science Commission, Li Ruilan, Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Huang Wenjin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Huang Wenli, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, Pan Wenyou, Deputy Minister of Light Industry, Qu Huijin, Deputy Minister of Culture, and Fan Yumao, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the People's Army. They warmly congratulated the Chinese people on their great victory of successfully conducting three nuclear explosions in 1966 under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by the beloved Chairman Mao. They said: As a powerful rear base for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, China's brilliant victories are a great support and encouragement to the fighting people of the entire nation of Vietnam, and a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. They enthusiastically praised the unbreakable combat unity and friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China, and wished Chairman Mao a long life!

Chairman of the Cambodian Students' Union, Pu Zai, said: "China's new nuclear explosion is a thunderbolt to U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, making them dumbfounded!"

He said, we are thrilled by China's new nuclear explosion. We know that the Soviet Union is pursuing a policy of collusion with the United States, while China supports the people of all countries in the world. China's success in this new nuclear explosion is a great victory for the people of Asia who are fighting against U.S. imperialism, and a great victory for the revolutionary people of the world.

Yumiyasato Reizo, Secretary-General of the Osaka Prefecture (orthodox) Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said, "Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have achieved an unprecedented feat in human history—the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, successfully detonating a spiritual atomic bomb, and now successfully detonating a material atomic bomb. It can be said that China has greatly played its role as a great fortress of world revolution in both material and spiritual aspects. It is warmly welcomed by the Japanese people, the Vietnamese people, and other peoples of the world who are struggling for independence and peace, and is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists, Japanese reactionaries, Soviet modern revisionists, and their new and old followers in Japan who are desperately pursuing a policy of 'containing' China."

Chairman of the Mozambique African National Union, Milas, said that the great progress made by the Chinese people under the guidance of Mao Zedong's brilliant thought is a victory for the revolutionary people of the world. When talking about the imperialists and their lackeys opposing the nuclear achievements of the Chinese people, he said: "What the enemy hates is what we love; what the enemy loves is what we hate."
