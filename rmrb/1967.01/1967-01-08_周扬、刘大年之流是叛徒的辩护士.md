Zhou Yang and his gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists have long been cloaked in the guise of Marxism, using counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought in various cultural fields. They even used the traitor of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Li Xucheng, as a tool to attack the Party. They attempted to blur the line between revolution and counter-revolution, defend traitors, and strike at the left, implementing bourgeois dictatorship. At that time, Zhou Yang's gang's counter-revolutionary activities were mainly carried out by Zhou Yang's confidant, former deputy director of the Institute of Modern History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Liu Dayou. This crime must be exposed and settled.

I.

Regarding the evaluation of Li Xucheng, the reactionary historical view represented by Hu Shi and Luo Ergang has long dominated. They dressed up the traitor Li Xucheng as a "hero." After liberation, Luo Ergang and his ilk continued to beautify and sing the praises of Li Xucheng, portraying him as a "great hero," and spreading the philosophy of traitors. This reactionary historical view received strong support from Zhou Yang. Therefore, whether in historical works, textbooks, literature, drama, or museum exhibits, the traitor Li Xucheng was dressed up as a "revolutionary hero." Between 1962 and 1963, Yang Hancheng, at Zhou Yang's instigation and support, even resurrected his old play from the 1930s, "Defense Literature," the drama "Li Xucheng." In this drama, Yang Hancheng gave a nauseating praise to the traitor Li Xucheng. He said that Li Xucheng was a "fighter from beginning to end" and the "most outstanding and brilliant son of the Chinese peasants." He even said, "Li Xucheng is our predecessor."

Facing this situation, the proletarian revolutionary faction could not ignore it and must reverse the historical distortion and clarify the line between revolution and counter-revolution. Thus, Comrade Qi Benyu published an article titled "Critique of Li Xucheng's Autobiography" in the August 15, 1963, issue of "Historical Research." In this article, Comrade Qi Benyu clearly pointed out that Li Xucheng's "Autobiography" is a "confession" of betraying the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary cause. The fact that Li Xucheng lost his revolutionary integrity and betrayed the revolutionary cause after being captured by the enemy is indisputable. He also pointed out that the line between heroes and traitors is not to be confused. "If we respect revolutionary history and the truth of historical materialism, we cannot allow the confession of traitors to continue to shine in the annals of revolution." Thus, Comrade Qi Benyu stood firmly on the revolutionary standpoint, scientifically interpreted the historical material of Li Xucheng's "Autobiography," restored the true face of history, and thoroughly negated the "merits" of Li Xucheng that had been distorted and exaggerated by the bourgeois reactionary "authorities," striking a powerful blow to Zhou Yang and his gang of traitors and their defenders.

Because of this, Comrade Qi Benyu and his article were extremely hated by Zhou Yang and his gang. They were enraged, went berserk, and attempted a fierce counterattack and ruthless suppression. One month after the publication of Comrade Qi Benyu's article, on September 14, Zhou Yang hastily convened a secret meeting at the old Propaganda Department, attended by counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Liu Dayou, Hou Wailu, and Li Zhe. At this secret meeting, Zhou Yang vigorously defended the traitor Li Xucheng, saying, "Li Xucheng fought all his life, and in the last eight days, he wavered a bit, which is not good, but we cannot negate his entire life." "Li Xucheng is a national hero, and it is completely wrong to call him a traitor." He even shamelessly said, "Even if a Communist writes a confession and is killed, it cannot be called a traitor, let alone a peasant!" Liu Dayou also shouted, "Li Xucheng is first and foremost a hero, a leader of the peasant revolution." Why did Zhou Yang and his gang defend Li Xucheng so fiercely? Zhou Yang himself said, "Li Xucheng is different from Cao Cao, he is a political figure." It is clear that Zhou Yang and his gang defended Li Xucheng for their political purposes.

Everyone knows that in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some of the exposed counter-revolutionary revisionists are shameful traitors. They are afraid of being exposed, trying to gild the face of their "predecessor" Li Xucheng, which is to gild their own traitorous faces. Yang Hancheng, who wrote the play "Li Xucheng," is himself a traitor. Zhou Yang and they are kindred spirits, defending them, saying, "Even if a Communist writes a confession and is killed, it cannot be called a traitor," which is sheer nonsense! Any Communist who cannot withstand the test of the enemy and loses revolutionary integrity can only be an unadulterated traitor.

At this meeting, Zhou Yang and his gang decided to immediately organize a counter-revolutionary attack meeting under the name of an "academic seminar," with bourgeois reactionary "authorities" directly speaking, following Zhou Yang's tune, attempting to "suppress" the revolutionary spirit of Comrade Qi Benyu and his comrades. They also decided to publish a report on this "seminar" in newspapers and journals, attempting to eliminate the revolutionary influence of Comrade Qi Benyu's article. Finally, they decided to have the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" in the field of history write an article to conclude this debate, attempting to "completely suppress" the revolutionary faction and defend their treacherous crimes. This plan was entrusted to Liu Dayou to execute.

After careful planning by Liu Dayou and others, the counter-revolutionary attack meeting was held on September 20, 1963, under the name of an "academic seminar" at the Institute of Modern History. The direct organizer and presider of the meeting was Liu Dayou, while the traitor Deng Tuo, anti-communist intellectual Jian Bozan, Hou Wailu, and other ghosts and snakes in the field of history were the core figures of this meeting. The commander-in-chief Zhou Yang hid behind the scenes, dispatching another confidant, Lin Jianqing, to "preside" over the meeting. These ghosts and snakes gathered together, and their counter-revolutionary arrogance was extremely rampant. They did not hide their purpose of attacking the revolutionary left, so the traitor Deng Tuo, upon entering the venue, immediately asked, "Is Qi Benyu here?" When he learned that Comrade Qi Benyu could not come because he was in the countryside, he said regretfully, "What a pity, what a pity!"

These counter-revolutionary revisionists at the meeting spoke wildly, slandering, defaming, and attacking Comrade Qi Benyu to the utmost. The traitor Deng Tuo cursed Comrade Qi Benyu for "emphasizing class struggle and distorting facts." Deng Tuo vigorously defended his traitor "predecessor" Li Xucheng, saying that the "Loyal King" is a "glorious image of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism" and that "he died a martyr in the end, which should be the final judgment." He also slandered Comrade Qi Benyu for "sacrificing historical national heroes for political struggle." The anti-communist veteran Jian Bozan denounced Comrade Qi Benyu's article as "full of inferences" and "too unfair." He said, "The Loyal King must be written as a revolutionary hero, otherwise, there will be few heroes among the peasant leaders." Hou Wailu also slandered Comrade Qi Benyu's article as "picking holes," "too nitpicky," and "reversing cases for the sake of reversing." He shamelessly defended the traitor, saying that Li Xucheng was "playing dumb in front of the enemy" and that "we should not deny him because of some blemishes." Liu Dayou, in his concluding remarks, shouted, "Qi's conclusion that the Loyal King is a traitor is wrong and cannot stand." He also viciously attacked Comrade Qi Benyu for using methods such as "not looking at the main trend," "attacking one point and not considering the rest," and "distorting facts" to negate Li Xucheng. Liu Dayou's conclusion was, "The Loyal King should not be negated and cannot be negated."

The reactionaries' principle towards the people's revolutionary cause is "to eliminate if possible, and to prepare to eliminate if not possible." Zhou Yang and his gang's principle towards Comrade Qi Benyu's "Critique of Li Xucheng's Autobiography" is also the same. Lin Jianqing, representing the old Propaganda Department, issued an order at this attack meeting, saying, "Qi Benyu's article gave an inappropriate evaluation of the Loyal King, which is harmful politically and cannot stand scientifically. It should be notified to all local newspapers and academic journals not to report, reprint, or publicly discuss this article." Zhou Yang and his gang thus attempted to use the power they had usurped to implement bourgeois dictatorship on the proletarian revolutionary faction.

II.

Just as Zhou Yang and his gang's counter-revolutionary arrogance was at its height, our great leader Chairman Mao timely discovered and stopped Zhou Yang and his gang's plot to defend the traitor Li Xucheng, giving great support to the revolutionary comrades.

However, Zhou Yang, Liu Dayou, and their ilk are typical counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals. Chairman Mao taught us: counter-revolutionaries "are always studying strategies to deal with us, 'observing the direction,' to seek an opportunity. Sometimes they will 'play dead and lie down,' waiting for the opportunity to 'counterattack.' They have long experience in class struggle, and they will engage in various forms of struggle—legal and illegal struggles." Zhou Yang and his gang did exactly this. After hearing Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of Li Xucheng, they "played dead and lay down," waiting for the opportunity to "counterattack," that is, they suppressed the originally planned report on the counter-revolutionary attack meeting but had Liu Dayou continue to write a counterattack article, preparing to publicly oppose Chairman Mao.

Liu Dayou's "The Evaluation of Li Xucheng" was written in this way. This is an article using conciliatory methods to continue to defend traitors.

Liu Dayou put on a face of "impartiality," seemingly criticizing both Comrade Qi Benyu and Luo Ergang. He said that both Luo Ergang and Comrade Qi Benyu were "subjectively trying to use class perspective to analyze historical figures and historical phenomena" and that they both "still have a revolutionary side," but they just "failed to combine revolutionary spirit and scientific spirit." The common root of their failure to objectively evaluate Li Xucheng and their extreme positions is that they "departed from the strict class analysis of Marxism, using the standard to measure proletarian revolutionary warriors to measure the leaders of the old-style peasant revolution." Here, Liu Dayou applied the "historicism" advocated by Jian Bozan and others, spreading the fallacy of "not using the proletarian standard to evaluate historical figures." His purpose was to oppose the Marxist class perspective, attempting to blur the fundamental line between revolution and counter-revolution, continuing to defend traitors. Liu Dayou wielded the revisionist big stick of "everyone has mistakes," actually attacking the revolutionary left and shielding and protecting the bourgeois rightists. This is precisely where Liu Dayou's cunning and treachery lie.

In this article, Liu Dayou also quoted Chairman Mao's instructions on Li Xucheng, but the thought running through the entire article was anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

Liu Dayou grossly distorted Chairman Mao's instructions, saying that Li Xucheng's "loss of revolutionary integrity is a serious blemish. Li Xucheng's attitude towards the enemy, regardless of the motive, is fundamentally wrong and not to be emulated." To say that the loss of revolutionary integrity is merely "a serious blemish" is not to defend Li Xucheng's betrayal and surrender? In fact, Liu Dayou's acknowledgment of Li Xucheng's "blemish" is also false. He completely stood on the traitor's side, singing the praises of his "predecessor." In the article, he praised Li Xucheng for "caring about the fate of the class and the nation, not about personal life and death, when in the enemy's cage." At the same time, he said that this traitor's confession is "full of the heroic words and brilliant thoughts that a revolutionary should have," and it is "the thought of a peasant revolutionary leader, the thought of a national hero. Li Xucheng's heroic image is not only not diminished here but is even more vivid." Liu Dayou said, "To call the 'Autobiography' a so-called confession of a traitor is obviously not in line with the facts." In Liu Dayou's view, since Li Xucheng's "Autobiography" is a complete record of the glorious deeds of such a "revolutionary hero," then what is there to criticize about such a person? What "serious blemish" is there to talk about? Of course, there is no need to negate such a person! Therefore, Liu Dayou said that Li Xucheng "died as a revolutionary loyal to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom under the enemy's butcher's knife," and his "great merits for the revolution and his loyalty to the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom until the end are enough to outweigh" his "mistakes." Liu Dayou racked his brains to dress up the traitor as a "revolutionary," trying every means to portray Li Xucheng as a model from beginning to end.

Liu Dayou openly opposed Chairman Mao's instructions, defending the traitor Li Xucheng, and this was most prominently shown in his arrogant shout that Li Xucheng's "merits" should be "forever inscribed in gold on the monument in Tiananmen Square," and he is a "pioneer of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution in modern China." Liu Dayou's madness in wanting to build a monument for the traitor fully shows that he is speaking from the traitor's standpoint. This is the inner confession of the agent of the bourgeoisie who has infiltrated the Party.

III.

Zhou Yang, Liu Dayou, and their ilk fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought and defended traitors, which was not accidental but had a political background.

At the black meeting on September 20, 1963, to attack the revolutionary left, Liu Dayou had once said unabashedly, "Affirming the Loyal King as an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal hero can better illustrate our point of view; saying he is a traitor does not help to illustrate our point of view." Zhou Yang had also said that the issue of Li Xucheng is a "political issue." Zhou Yang, Liu Dayou, and their ilk here admitted that their actions were serving the class interests of the bourgeoisie.

In the issue of evaluating Li Xucheng, the struggle between the proletarian left and the bourgeois right was a reflection of the sharp class struggle at home and abroad at that time.

At that time, internationally, the revisionist clique led by Khrushchev, while completely negating Stalin, unleashed a black wind of defending traitors and rehabilitating them. This black wind reached its peak at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, to the extent that the political corpse of Trotskyism, which had long been dead, was revived, and they clamored to "erect a monument for those who were framed by Stalin" and to inscribe Trotsky's name in "gold" on "this monument."

Domestically, the ghosts and snakes also took advantage of our temporary economic difficulties to unleash a black wind of defending and rehabilitating the right-opportunist elements who had been removed from office. In this counter-revolutionary backflow, the "San Jia Village" gang led by Deng Tuo played the role of the vanguard. Wu Han successively threw out "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and "National Hero of the Ming Dynasty, Yu Qian," openly defending Hai Rui and Yu Qian (Minister of Defense) who had been removed from office.

In the midst of these domestic and international counter-revolutionary restoration clamor, Zhou Yang, Liu Dayou, and their ilk brought out the corpse of the traitor Li Xucheng to defend those traitors who had left a stench for a thousand years. This shows that they are the echoers of Khrushchev's revisionism, and like Deng Tuo and Wu Han, they are thorough and thorough counter-revolutionary revisionists.

In December 1963, Chairman Mao pointed out that in the literary and artistic circles, "many departments are still ruled by the 'dead.' 'Many Communists enthusiastically promote feudal and capitalist arts but are not enthusiastic about promoting socialist arts, which is a strange thing.' After this instruction was issued, Zhou Yang and his gang still instructed "Historical Research" to typeset Liu Dayou's "The Evaluation of Li Xucheng," preparing to throw it out at any time. By June 1964, Chairman Mao again severely criticized the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and various associations under Zhou Yang's control. Chairman Mao pointed out that these associations had "slipped to the brink of revisionism in recent years. If they are not thoroughly reformed, they will inevitably become like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day." Zhou Yang and his gang of counter-revolutionary two-faced individuals felt that the situation was "not good," so they turned to adopt the strategy of "playing dead and lying down, waiting for the opportunity to 'counterattack'" to oppose Chairman Mao's instructions, attempting to avoid the impending revolutionary storm. Zhou Yang even personally instructed Liu Dayou to immediately dismantle the typesetting of "The Evaluation of Li Xucheng," which had been typeset for half a year, attempting to cover up the evidence, deceive, and pass through, waiting for a "comeback."

Under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of revolutionaries finally united to open fire on the bourgeois rightists. Thus, a struggle centered on the evaluation of Li Xucheng unfolded in July 1964. After a few months of battle, the proletarian revolutionary faction finally exposed one of the passionate defenders of Li Xucheng, Luo Ergang, revealing the traitorous face of Li Xucheng, and smashing Zhou Yang and his gang's plot. However, Zhou Yang, Liu Dayou, and others used their usurped positions and the mutual protection of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique to temporarily pass through. Therefore, the criticism of bourgeois reactionary historiography on the issue of Li Xucheng in 1964 was not thorough.

However, history has never developed according to the wishes of reactionary figures. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, finally thoroughly smashed the nest of counter-revolutionary revisionism, exposing Zhou Yang, Liu Dayou, and this small group of demons and monsters.

We expose this issue to let everyone see how the counter-revolutionary gang led by Zhou Yang used the so-called "academic issue" to carry out their counter-revolutionary political activities. Chairman Mao taught us: "We revolutionary party members must understand their tricks, study their strategies, and defeat them. We must not be naive and simplify the complex class struggle." We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching. We should learn lessons from the two-faced tactics of Zhou Yang, Liu Dayou, and their ilk.

    周扬、刘大年之流是叛徒的辩护士
    晋群新
    周扬一伙反革命修正主义分子，多年来，一直披着马克思主义的外衣，采用反革命两面派的手法，在文化界的各个阵地上，向党向社会主义向毛泽东思想进行猖狂进攻。太平天国革命的叛徒李秀成，也被他们用来作为反党的工具。他们企图用它来混淆革命和反革命的界限，为叛徒作辩护；并且在这个问题上打击左派，实行反革命的资产阶级专政。当时，周扬一伙的这个反革命活动，主要是授权于周扬的心腹、中国科学院近代史研究所前副所长刘大年去负责执行的。对于周扬一伙的这个罪行，必须揭露和清算。
    一
    对于李秀成的评价问题，以胡适、罗尔纲为代表的资产阶级反动的史学观点，长期以来，一直占据着统治地位。他们把李秀成这个叛徒，打扮成为“英雄”。解放以后，罗尔纲之流继续极力美化李秀成，歌颂李秀成，把李秀成这个叛徒描绘成盖世“英雄”，大肆宣扬叛徒哲学。这种反动的史学观点，得到了周扬的大力支持。因此，无论是在历史著作、教科书以至文学、戏剧方面，还是在博物馆的陈列上，李秀成这个叛徒都被打扮成“革命英雄”。在一九六二到一九六三年间，阳翰笙在周扬的怂恿和支持下，还重新抛出了他在三十年代宣扬阶级投降主义的“国防文学”的旧作话剧《李秀成》。阳翰笙在这个话剧中，对叛徒李秀成作了令人作呕的吹捧。他胡说什么李秀成是“从头到尾都在战斗”的“中国农民最优秀、最卓越的儿子”。他甚至还说：“李秀成是我们前辈一代”。
    面对着这个情况，无产阶级革命派不能置之不理，必须把这种历史的颠倒再颠倒过来，划清革命与反革命的界限。于是，戚本禹同志在一九六三年八月十五日出版的《历史研究》上，发表了《评李秀成自述》一文。戚本禹同志在这篇文章中明确地指出：李秀成《自述》“是一个背叛太平天国革命事业的‘自白书’”，李秀成“在被敌人俘虏以后丧失革命气节、背叛革命事业的事实，也是否定不了的”。他还指出：英雄和叛徒的界限是不容混淆的，“如果我们尊重革命的历史、尊重历史唯物论的真理，我们便不能让变节分子的‘自白书’继续彪炳于革命的史册。”这样，戚本禹同志就站在坚定的革命立场上，对李秀成《自述》这一历史材料作了科学的解释，恢复了历史的本来面目，从而彻底地否定了资产阶级反动“权威”一贯歪曲渲染的李秀成的“功绩”，有力地打击了周扬这伙叛徒和他们的辩护士。
    正因为这样，戚本禹同志和他的文章，便遭到周扬等人的极端仇视。他们暴跳如雷，歇斯底里大发作，企图进行疯狂反扑和残酷镇压。在戚本禹同志文章发表后的一个月，即九月十四日，周扬就急急忙忙地在旧中宣部亲自召开了有刘大年、侯外庐、黎澍等反革命修正主义分子参加的黑会。周扬在这个黑会上，竭力为叛徒李秀成辩护。他说：“李秀成奋斗一生，最后八天有点动摇，当然不好，但是不能否定他的全部。”
  “李秀成是一个民族英雄，把他说成叛徒是完全错误的。”他甚至还恬不知耻地说：“即使共产党人写过自白书被杀了，也不能叫作叛徒，何况农民！”刘大年也跟着大喊：李秀成首先“是个英雄，是农民革命领袖人物”。周扬一伙为什么要那样疯狂地保护李秀成呢？周扬自己说，因为“李秀成不同于曹操，是个政治性人物”。很清楚，周扬一伙是为了他们的政治目的而去保李秀成的。
    大家知道，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中已经揭露出来的反革命修正主义分子中，有一些人就是可耻的叛徒。他们做贼心虚，竭力想在他们的“前辈”李秀成脸上抹金，也就是给他们自己的叛徒嘴脸上抹金。写话剧《李秀成》的阳翰笙，自己就是一个叛徒。周扬和他们臭味相投，为他们作辩护，说什么“即使共产党人写过自白书被杀了，也不能叫作叛徒”，这完全是一派胡说！任何共产党人如果在敌人面前经不起考验，丧失了革命的气节，就只能是不折不扣的叛徒。
    周扬等人在这个会上，决定立即组织一个以“学术座谈会”为名的反革命围攻会，由那些资产阶级反动“权威”们直接出面，按照周扬的调子发言，妄图把戚本禹等同志的革命锐气“杀下去”。他们又决定在报刊上发表一个关于这个“座谈会”的“报道”，妄图以此来消除戚本禹同志文章的革命影响。最后，他们还决定由史学界的资产阶级反动“权威”写一篇文章，给这场论战作“结论”，企图“彻底压倒”革命派，从而保住他们制造的李秀成这个“革命英雄”，为他们的叛卖罪行辩解。他们的这套计划交给刘大年负责执行。
    经过刘大年等的精心筹划，反革命围攻会就在一九六三年九月二十日以“学术座谈会”的名义，在近代史研究所召开了。会议的直接组织者和主持者是刘大年，而叛徒邓拓、反共知识分子翦伯赞、侯外庐这些史学界的牛鬼蛇神都是这次会议的核心人物。总指挥周扬躲在幕后操纵，派出他自己的另一名亲信林涧青去出面“坐镇”。这些牛鬼蛇神坐在一起，反革命气焰非常嚣张。他们毫不掩饰他们的目的就是要围攻革命左派，所以叛徒邓拓一进会场劈头就问：“戚本禹来没有？”当他得知戚本禹同志因为下乡没有能来之后，他便万分遗憾地说：“可惜呀，可惜！”
    这些反革命修正主义分子在会上大放厥词，对戚本禹同志竭尽谩骂、诬蔑和攻击之能事。叛徒邓拓大骂戚本禹同志“强调阶级斗争而颠倒事实”。邓拓竭力为他的叛徒“前辈”李秀成作辩护，说什么“忠王是反帝反封建光荣形象”，“他最后还是殉国，这应是盖棺论定”等等。他还诬蔑戚本禹同志“为了政治斗争而牺牲历史上的民族英雄”。反共老手翦伯赞诋毁戚本禹同志的文章“通篇是推论”，“太不公平”。他说：“忠王必须写成革命英雄，否则，农民领袖就没有几个英雄了。”侯外庐也大肆诽谤戚本禹同志的文章是“钻空子”，“过于挑剔”，“为翻案而翻案”。他无耻地为叛徒辩护，说李秀成是“在敌人面前装糊涂”，“我们不应因其有某些污点而抹煞他”，等等。刘大年在总结发言中叫嚣：“戚文的结论说忠王是叛徒，这是错的，站不住脚。”他还恶毒地攻击戚本禹同志采取了所谓“不看主流”、“攻其一点，不及其余，即一棍子打死”和“曲解事实”等手法来否定李秀成。刘大年作出的结论是：“忠王不应否定，也否定不了。”
    反动派对待人民革命事业的原则，总是“能够消灭者一定消灭之，暂时不能消灭者准备将来消灭之。”周扬一伙对待戚本禹同志的《评李秀成自述》的原则也是这样。林涧青代表旧中宣部在这个围攻会上颁布“命令”说：“戚本禹的文章对忠王作了不当评价，这在政治上是有害的，在科学上是站不住脚的。应该通知各地报纸、学报都不要报道这篇文章，也不要转载，不要公开讨论。”周扬一伙就是这样妄图利用自己手里窃占的权力，对无产阶级革命派实行资产阶级专政。
    二
    正当周扬一伙的反革命气焰极其嚣张的时候，我们的伟大领袖毛主席及时地发觉并制止了周扬一伙为叛徒李秀成辩护的阴谋，给予革命同志极大的支持。
    但是，周扬、刘大年之流是一伙典型的反革命两面派。毛主席教导我们：反革命分子“老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞。有时他们会‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’。他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。”周扬一伙就是这样做的。他们听到了毛主席关于李秀成问题的指示之后，就“装死躺下”，“待机”“反攻”，即对原定要发表的关于反革命围攻会的“报道”压下了，却要刘大年继续赶写反扑文章，准备公开和毛主席唱反调。
    刘大年的《李秀成评价问题》就是这样写出来的。这是一篇用折衷主义的手法，继续为叛徒作辩护的文章。
    刘大年装出一副“公正不偏”的面孔，似乎是在对戚本禹同志和罗尔纲“各打五十大板”。他说，罗尔纲和戚本禹同志都是在“主观上是想用阶级观点分析历史人物，研究历史现象”的，他们都“还具有革命性的一面”，而只是“没有能够做到把革命性和科学性结合起来”罢了。他们“未能对李秀成作出客观评价、各走极端的共同根源”，是他们“离开马克思主义严格的阶级分析观点，拿衡量无产阶级革命战士的标准去衡量旧式农民革命的领袖人物”。在这里，刘大年应用了翦伯赞等人所宣扬的“历史主义”，散布“不能用无产阶级的标准去评价历史人物”的谬论。他的目的就是反对马克思主义的阶级观点，企图抹煞革命和反革命的根本界限，继续为叛徒作辩护。刘大年挥舞着“错误人人有份”的修正主义大棒，实际上是打击革命左派，袒护和包庇资产阶级右派。这也正是刘大年阴险狡猾的地方。
    刘大年在这篇文章里也引用了毛主席关于李秀成的指示，但是贯串全文的思想恰恰是反毛泽东思想的。
    刘大年对毛主席的指示作了最无耻的歪曲，他说：李秀成“丧失革命大节，这是一个严重的污点。李秀成在敌人面前采取的这种态度，不论是出于什么动机，都是根本错误的，不足为训的”。把丧失革命大节说成仅仅“是一个严重的污点”，这不是说明刘大年在为李秀成的投降变节辩护又是什么呢？
    其实，刘大年承认李秀成的这个“污点”也是假的。他完全站在叛徒的立场上，为他们的“前辈”歌功颂德。他在文章中大肆吹捧李秀成“在敌人囚笼里的时候，关心的不是个人生死问题，而是阶级前途、民族前途的问题”。同时，他把这份叛徒的自白书说成是“包含着一个革命者应有的豪言壮语和光辉的思想”，“是一个农民革命领袖的思想，是一个民族英雄的思想。李秀成的英雄形象在这里不但没有减色，反而是表现得更加鲜明”。刘大年说，“把《自述》说成是所谓一个叛徒的‘自白书’，那显然是不合事实的”。在刘大年看来，既然李秀成《自述》完全是一个“革命英雄”的丰功伟绩的记录，那末对于这样一个人物还有什么可以指责的地方呢？还有什么“严重的污点”呢？当然更谈不到要否定这个人物了！所以，刘大年说，李秀成最后“是作为一个忠于太平天国的革命者死在敌人屠刀下面的”，“他对革命立下的巨大功勋和最后仍然尽忠于太平天国而死足以压倒”他的“错误”。刘大年挖空心思地把这个叛徒打扮成为“革命者”，想方设法地把李秀成说成自始至终都是“足以为训”的。
    刘大年公开对抗毛主席指示，为叛徒李秀成辩护，还突出地表现在他狂妄地叫喊：李秀成的“功劳”应当“永远用金字铭刻在天安门广场的丰碑上面”，他是“近代中国反帝反封建革命的先驱者”。刘大年丧心病狂地要为叛徒树碑立传，这正充分地说明了他是完全站在叛徒的立场上来说话的。这是混进党内的资产阶级代理人的内心表白。
    三
    周扬、刘大年之流疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，为叛徒进行辩护，这绝不是偶然的，而是有其政治背景的。
  在一九六三年九月二十日围攻革命左派的黑会上，刘大年就曾经毫不掩饰地说过：“肯定忠王是反帝反封建的英雄，更可说明我们的观点；说他是叛徒，无助于说明我们的观点。”周扬也曾经说过，李秀成的问题“是一个政治性的问题”。周扬、刘大年之流在这里不打自招地承认了他们的所作所为是为资产阶级的阶级利益服务的。
    在李秀成评价问题上，无产阶级左派和资产阶级右派之间的斗争，正是当时国内外尖锐的阶级斗争的反映。
      当时，在国际上，以赫鲁晓夫为首的修正主义集团，在全盘否定斯大林的同时，大刮为叛徒辩护、翻案的黑风。这股黑风到苏共二十二大的时候，达到了最疯狂的地步，以至使早已成为政治僵尸的托洛茨基分子也死灰复燃，叫嚣要“为受斯大林陷害者树立纪念碑”，并要把托洛茨基的名字“用金字”刻在“这个纪念碑上”。
    在国内，牛鬼蛇神也乘我们经济暂时困难之机，大刮为被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子辩护、翻案的黑风。在这股反革命的逆流中，以邓拓为首的“三家村”黑帮起了急先锋的作用。吴晗先后抛出了《海瑞罢官》、《明代民族英雄于谦》，公开为被罢了官的海瑞和于谦（国防部长）鸣冤叫屈。
    在这些国内外反革命复辟的喧嚣声中，周扬、刘大年之流抬出叛徒李秀成的僵尸，来为那些遗臭万年的叛徒辩护。这就说明，他们是赫鲁晓夫修正主义的应声虫，他们和邓拓、吴晗一样，是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义分子。
    一九六三年十二月，毛主席指出：文艺界“许多部门至今还是‘死人’统治着”。“许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。”在这个指示发出以后，周扬一伙依然指使《历史研究》为刘大年的这篇《李秀成评价问题》排版，准备随时抛出。到了一九六四年六月，毛主席再次对周扬控制下的全国文联和各个协会提出了严厉的批评。毛主席指出：这些协会在“最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成像匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体”。周扬一伙反革命两面派感到形势“不妙”，便又转而采取了“‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’”的斗争策略，来对抗毛主席的指示，企图躲开即将来临的革命风暴。周扬甚至还亲自指使刘大年把排版已达半年之久的《李秀成评价问题》立即拆版，企图消赃灭迹，蒙混过关，以待“东山再起”。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，广大的革命群众终于一齐向资产阶级右派开火了。于是，一场围绕着李秀成评价问题展开的斗争，在一九六四年七月开展起来。经过几个月的战斗，无产阶级革命派终于把李秀成的狂热辩护士之一罗尔纲揪了出来，揭穿了李秀成的叛徒面目，粉碎了周扬一伙的阴谋。可是，周扬、刘大年等人却利用他们窃据的职权，以及反革命修正主义集团的相互庇护，暂时蒙混“过关”。因此，一九六四年关于李秀成问题上对资产阶级反动史学的批判是不彻底的。
    但是，历史从来不是按照反动人物的愿望发展的。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，终于彻底捣毁了反革命修正主义的巢穴，把周扬、刘大年这一小撮妖魔鬼怪都揪了出来。
    我们把这个问题揭露出来，让大家看看以周扬为首的这伙反革命分子是怎样利用所谓“学术问题”来进行他们的反革命政治活动的。毛主席教导我们：“我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”我们要牢记毛主席这个教导。我们应当从周扬、刘大年之流的反革命两面派手法中，吸取教训。
