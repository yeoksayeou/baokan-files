The torrents of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are sweeping away the dark nests of venomous snakes like a raging sea.

Boom! The old Central Propaganda Department, long occupied by counter-revolutionary revisionists, has collapsed.

At a recent meeting of the proletarian cultural revolution in the literary and artistic circles, Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out: "The old Beijing Municipal Committee, the old Central Propaganda Department, and the old Ministry of Culture have colluded to commit heinous crimes against the Party and the people. These crimes must be thoroughly exposed and settled. The bourgeois reactionary line within our Party, which targets the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, must also be thoroughly exposed and criticized."

The exposure and settlement of the old Central Propaganda Department, including Zhou Yang, are related to summarizing the revolutionary history of several decades with Mao Zedong Thought, the history of the struggle between socialism and capitalism during the period of socialist revolution, the history of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line within the Party, and the deeper excavation of the political bourgeois anti-Party and anti-socialist black line. This must be thoroughly investigated and clarified.

Zhou Yang is a typical counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor. He has always used two-faced tactics to hide his counter-revolutionary political face, distort history, confuse the issue, and carry out various evil activities under the guise of red flags. He is a good negative example for us to recognize counter-revolutionary two-faced traitors now and in the future. His last public report, titled "Raising High the Red Flag of Mao Zedong Thought, Becoming Literary and Artistic Warriors Who Can Both Labor and Create," delivered on November 29, 1965, at the National Conference of Active Amateur Literary Creators, is a typical example of waving the red flag to oppose the red flag.

This report faithfully carried out the instructions of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique's leader, vigorously resisting Mao Zedong's instructions on criticizing representatives of the bourgeoisie. This report, under the guise of Marxist phrases, grossly distorted and fabricated the class struggle on the cultural front over the past sixteen years. This report disguised Zhou Yang, a revisionist, as an executor of Mao Zedong's literary line, completely reversing history. What is particularly infuriating is that Zhou Yang, in this report, vilely distorted Mao Zedong's extremely important instructions on the proletarian cultural revolution.

In June 1964, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out to Zhou Yang and the national literary and artistic circles he controlled that these associations and the publications they controlled (it is said that there are a few good ones) have, for the most part (not everyone), not executed the Party's policies over the past fifteen years, have become bureaucrats, have not approached the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have not reflected the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even slipped to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably become organizations like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day. This is a severe criticism and blow to the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line in the literary and artistic circles led by Zhou Yang. This instruction thoroughly exposed that since the national liberation, the leaders of the old Central Propaganda Department, including Zhou Yang, have executed a revisionist literary line against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought; thoroughly exposed that most of the organs, organizations, and publications on the cultural front have been controlled by the revisionist clique and have become tools for the bourgeoisie to launch a full-scale attack on the proletariat, and a power struggle must be waged; thoroughly exposed that Zhou Yang and his revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles are preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, and once the time is ripe, they will stage a counter-revolutionary coup under the direction of ambitious men like Khrushchev.

Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction was issued as an official document to various levels of Party organizations on July 11, 1964, promoting the cultural revolution nationwide. However, Zhou Yang, who has always resisted Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, dared to blatantly distort Comrade Mao Zedong's words in his report, saying: "He pointed out that some important cultural departments and literary publications basically do not execute the Party's policies, do not approach the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and do not reflect the socialist revolution and construction." He deleted the long-term period of "fifteen years" pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong and reduced the "majority" of cultural departments and publications pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong to "some" cultural departments and publications, trying to cover up the evil of this anti-Party, anti-socialist black line. Comrade Mao Zedong's exposure of their gang's "acting as bureaucrats" was also deleted by Zhou Yang, which means acting as bourgeois aristocrats to seize the political power of the proletariat and the working people. What is most intolerable is that he cut off the most important words of Comrade Mao Zedong, that is, pointing out that the associations under Zhou Yang's control "have recently slipped to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably become organizations like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day." This precise scientific judgment and severe political warning was completely deleted. Under the guise of "raising high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought," he played a grand deception of distorting, falsifying, and resisting Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Mao's instruction cannot be erased by Zhou Yang's black hands. Below, we will use Comrade Mao's instruction as a guide, through an analysis of the history of class struggle over the past sixteen years, and with a large amount of irrefutable facts, to expose the true face of Zhou Yang, the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor.

A History of Counter-Revolutionary Two-Faced Traitor

In his report to young amateur writers, Zhou Yang pretended to be "consistently correct" and jumped out to "summarize" the "five major debates and criticisms" since liberation. He even dressed himself up as the representative of the "comprehensive and correct execution of Mao Zedong's literary line."

This is a lie. This is deceit. This is a reversal of black and white. This is a forgery of history in broad daylight.

What is the truth?

Look at Zhou Yang's true face before and after the major struggles on the ideological front:

The first major struggle was the criticism of the film "Wu Xun" in 1951. This struggle took place in the early days of the People's Republic of China. At that time, land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were being carried out nationwide, and the bourgeoisie, in collusion with the remnants of feudalism, launched a fierce attack on the young proletarian dictatorship. They threw out "Wu Xun." This is an extremely ugly counter-revolutionary film that fervently praises the landlord class and their running dogs, fervently advocates the most shameful servility and capitulationism, and fervently slanders the peasant revolutionary struggle. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries' fake "China Film Production Company" had started shooting this film, but they did not finish it before the sound of the People's Liberation Army's cannons. After liberation, the revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang inherited the unfinished business of the Kuomintang reactionaries and completed the shooting of this counter-revolutionary film under his direct leadership. As soon as the film was screened, it was immediately praised by a group of bourgeois representatives inside and outside the Party, advocating the learning of Wu Xun and the "spirit of Wu Xun," which means that the proletariat should kneel down and surrender to the landlord class and the bourgeoisie like Wu Xun. Comrade Mao Zedong personally initiated the criticism of "Wu Xun." In an editorial titled "We Should Pay Attention to the Discussion on the Film 'Wu Xun'" written for the May 20 issue of the People's Daily, he sharply pointed out the error of some "so-called Marxists in the Communist Party" surrendering to bourgeois reactionary thoughts and seriously asked: "Has the reactionary thought of the bourgeoisie infiltrated the fighting Communist Party? This is not a fact? Where did the Marxism that some Communist Party members claim to have learned go?"

The "some Communist Party members" mentioned by Chairman Mao include Zhou Yang as the leader. Zhou Yang was then the deputy head of the Central Propaganda Department and the secretary of the Party group of the Ministry of Culture. He claimed, "I myself watched the film 'Wu Xun' very early," and this reactionary film was screened nationwide after his approval. As soon as this reactionary film came out, it was discovered by Comrade Mao Zedong. At that time, some comrades in the Central Committee notified Zhou Yang that "Wu Xun" was a reactionary film that propagated bourgeois reformism and must be criticized, and they had not yet mentioned Comrade Mao Zedong's opinion, but it was rejected by Zhou Yang. Zhou Yang, with an arrogant attitude, put on a full aristocratic air and said disdainfully, "What's so great about having a bit of reformism?"

After the May 20 editorial of the People's Daily was published, under the severe questioning of Comrade Mao Zedong, Zhou Yang was forced to make a few false confessions. In fact, he had been secretly resisting all along and looking for opportunities to counterattack. On June 4, 1951, just as the criticism of "Wu Xun" began, Zhou Yang immediately wrote a black letter to one of his generals, Yu Ling, instructing Yu Ling to "handle specific issues cautiously and carefully in the struggle of ideas" and anxiously saying, "What we need most is the real situation." Yu Ling was then the deputy head of the Shanghai Cultural Bureau, and he sheltered and colluded with a group of ghosts and snakes of various kinds. The so-called "cautious and careful" means that Yu Ling should pay attention to "carefully" protecting the bourgeois forces and protecting those counter-revolutionaries disguised as literary figures; the so-called "not to be rash and reckless" means instructing the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the cultural circle to weaken the sharp political content in Chairman Mao's criticism as much as possible and adopt a delaying strategy to turn a serious class struggle into a "cognition" issue. The so-called "real situation" circled by Zhou Yang in the letter means collecting various materials to protect the right-wing bourgeoisie and engaging in anti-Party activities. This was a major anti-Party conspiracy by Zhou Yang and his gang during the criticism of "Wu Xun."

Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, breaking through Zhou Yang's numerous resistances, a Wu Xun Historical Investigation Team was organized. This team overcame the sabotage and obstruction of Zhou Yang's secretary, Zhong Dianhui, and relied on the broad masses to carry out its work. The investigation results of this team were the articles "Wu Xun Historical Investigation Record" published in the People's Daily from July 23 to 28. This article, revised by Comrade Mao Zedong, exposed with iron facts the reactionary face of Wu Xun, a big landlord, big creditor, and big hooligan, and provided the best summary for this great debate. At this time, Zhou Yang saw that the iron-clad evidence was overwhelming, and further resistance was not possible, so he immediately changed his strategy, quickly put on a different face, and came out to write articles to make a profit. In his article published in August, he first said a few words about how he "had not been able to fully recognize and point out its serious political reactionary nature in time," and then transformed himself into making a "systematic" summary, as if he, Zhou Yang, was the leader of this great struggle, not someone else!

Of course, Zhou Yang was not willing to give up on Comrade Mao Zedong's criticism. As soon as the high tide of criticism passed, Zhou Yang eagerly stood on the podium of the Second National Congress of Literary and Art Workers and launched a counterattack, correcting the criticism of "Wu Xun." In his report titled "Struggle to Create More Excellent Literary and Artistic Works," he said sternly: "Since the criticism of the film 'Wu Xun,' 'our criticism work has developed some biases' that 'need to be corrected.'" He then fiercely attacked what he called "some rude and arbitrary criticisms from dogmatic formulas," "some extreme views of a part of the readers" (that is, the revolutionary criticism of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers), and added that the Party's leadership did not "support" the so-called "creative work," "making many writers feel suppressed and distressed in spirit. This mood needs to be changed."

Look, how thoroughly Zhou Yang "corrects" here! He actually completely negated the criticism of the reactionary film "Wu Xun" initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong, strangled the criticism of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and overturned Comrade Mao Zedong's criticism of Zhou Yang and others who "claimed to have learned Marxism." The proletariat had just begun to criticize the bourgeoisie, and Zhou Yang was already shouting "distress" and "suppression," reflecting how keenly this representative of the bourgeoisie reflected the voice of his class!

Look, before and after the criticism of "Wu Xun," what role did Zhou Yang play! At first, he, as the "old man" of the literary and artistic circles, led his gang to spread poison, strongly opposed Mao Zedong Thought, strongly opposed the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, and resisted Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions. As soon as the battle began, he quickly made a false confession to deceive the Party and the people. Then, he pretended to be "correct" to "summarize" the struggle, taking the credit for himself. Next, he gradually pulled the movement to the right, launching a counterattack on the revolutionary people. Comrades, please note that Zhou Yang is an old hand at playing the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor. Grasping this point, we can see Zhou Yang's basic appearance in various struggles. We can also see the characteristics of other already exposed and not yet exposed "two-faced" people.

The second major struggle was the criticism of Yu Pingbo's "Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" and Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts in 1954. This struggle took place during an important period when our country's socialist transformation was deeply carried out. With the Party's proposal of the general line of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, the bourgeoisie, unwilling to die, intensified their attacks on the socialist forces and sought their agents within the Party. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee thoroughly exposed and smashed the anti-Party conspiracy of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi to seize the Party. After Stalin's death, the modern revisionist tide began to surge. This situation directly affected our country's literary and artistic circles, making some bourgeois elements inside and outside the Party active. Led by Zhou Yang, the revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles used their monopolized publications and newspapers to strongly support the bourgeois "authorities" and adopted a nobleman-like suppression and attack on the new Marxist forces. They fully supported the extreme reactionary Hu Shi faction's idealism and ruthlessly suppressed all those who rose to criticize the bourgeoisie, serving the bourgeoisie's resistance to socialist transformation. Comrade Mao Zedong saw the serious situation of the black line's dictatorship in the literary and artistic circles and launched another criticism of "Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" and Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts.

On October 16, 1954, Comrade Mao Zedong, in a letter to the comrades of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and other relevant comrades, sharply and deeply criticized those who "claimed to be great figures" and suppressed the criticism of the bourgeoisie as "some people." He angrily said: "The thing is done by two 'small figures,' while the 'great figures' often do not pay attention and often obstruct, they form a united front with bourgeois writers in idealism, and are willing to be the captives of the bourgeoisie. This is almost the same as the situation when the films 'Secret History of the Forbidden City' and 'Wu Xun' were screened." The film "Secret History of the Forbidden City," which was called a patriotic film but was actually a traitorous film, has not been criticized since it was screened nationwide. Although "Wu Xun" was criticized, no lessons have been drawn, and strange things have appeared again, such as tolerating Yu Pingbo's idealism and obstructing the very lively criticism articles of "small figures." This is worth our attention.

The "some people" who were sharply criticized by Comrade Mao Zedong for claiming to be "great figures" and suppressing "small figures," and the "some people" who opposed the reprinting of the criticism of Yu Pingbo in the People's Daily, included Zhou Yang, as well as Ding Ling and Feng Xuefeng, who controlled the Literary Gazette.

It was Zhou Yang who had always executed a reactionary line of praising bourgeois "authorities" and suppressing new Marxist forces. On June 30, 1949, in an article titled "On the Problem of Intellectuals" published in the Wenhui Daily, he praised bourgeois intellectuals as "one of the leading forces of the revolution," saying that without them "the revolution cannot be carried out," and absurdly saying that urban workers and peasants lacked knowledge, "this deficiency on one side needs to be filled by urban intellectuals." He repeatedly called for relying on the organizations of writers and artists themselves, using the so-called "social methods to lead artistic creation" (19th issue of the Literary Gazette in 1953), not allowing the proletariat to interfere with the "authorities" controlled by the bourgeoisie. Zhou Yang thus arranged and "filled" bourgeois "authorities," traitors, and counter-revolutionaries in various fields of the cultural circle to act as "leading forces," suppressing all revolutionaries' criticism of them.

It was Zhou Yang who, until the eve of the criticism of "Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" in 1954, specially praised bourgeois intellectuals in the article "Carrying Forward the Fighting Tradition of the May Fourth Literary Revolution," saying "democratic tendencies," "having thoughts and talents," "having aspirations and ideals," "having conscience and upright people," ... Look, isn't this simply praising Chinese bourgeois intellectuals to the sky?

It was Zhou Yang who, in this article, also strongly praised "advanced science and advanced cultural thoughts of the West." Here, the "West" refers to the culture of European and American bourgeoisie, which is various reactionary bourgeois idealism and metaphysical worldviews, the most influential of which is the idealism of the Hu Shi faction, that is, bourgeois pragmatism. To make bourgeois reactionary philosophy so sacred, isn't this the greatest support for the bourgeois "authorities" like Yu Pingbo? Isn't this completely "willing" to be the spokesperson for the bourgeoisie?

It was Zhou Yang who, in this great struggle, again played the role of a counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor. As soon as the battle began, Zhou Yang tried his best to turn this sharp political and ideological struggle into a so-called "pure" academic discussion. On October 24, 1954, at a symposium held by the Classical Literature Department of the Chinese Writers' Association, he impatiently wanted people to study "complex content" so-called "academic and ideological issues" and opened a large number of topics for people to engage in trivial research. On October 28, the People's Daily, according to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, published an article questioning the editors of the Literary Gazette, publicly exposing the bourgeois nobleman attitude of some leaders in the literary and artistic circles. Zhou Yang saw that the situation was not good, so he immediately manufactured a false confession. On December 8, 1954, at the enlarged meeting of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the National Federation of Writers, he said, "We abandoned the criticism and struggle against bourgeois idealism" and "this is the biggest mistake in our work. I am also guilty of this mistake." and so on. This "confession," to be blunt, is just "everyone is guilty." He did not intend to settle accounts with his reactionary bourgeois political stance at all, but only wanted to use this to confuse the issue. What "we" "further developed the criticism of Hu Shi's bourgeois idealist thoughts," appropriating the merits of heaven as his own, not knowing the shame of the world. Everyone knows: this "we" does not include you, Zhou Yang. Your so-called "comprehensive criticism" is just a rehash of old tricks, which is to maintain your usurped leading position, so as to pull the struggle to the right and launch a counterattack. By 1961 and 1962, didn't you continuously publish millions of words of Cao Xueqin's death year research, ancestral research, and research on the location of the Grand View Garden... and so on, filling entire pages with strange and weird maps, carrying out a great restoration of Hu Shi's idealism?

The third major struggle was the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique from 1954 to 1955, following the criticism of Hu Shi. This was a sharp struggle led by the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong to purge hidden counter-revolutionaries. It was a serious blow to counter-revolutionary forces. Zhou Yang's thoughts were essentially the same as Hu Feng's thoughts. Like Hu Feng, he repeatedly advocated that "the highest principle of art is truth" (1952), opposed the Marxist worldview, and opposed Mao Zedong Thought. Like Hu Feng, he opposed the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposed writers going deep into the struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and even arrogantly said, "Not going, it can still be combined," "We and the workers, peasants, and soldiers are to divide labor" (1949), openly regarding himself as a nobleman. Like Hu Feng, he opposed writing on major themes, opposed serving proletarian politics with literature and art, and strongly advocated that there should be "complete freedom" in "choosing themes" and that this freedom should be "guaranteed to the greatest extent" (1953). Like Hu Feng, he advocated bourgeois humanitarianism and humanism, opposed class analysis, and used language like "the process of the growth of new national character" (1949) to distort the class appearance and character of the working people. Like Hu Feng, he advocated that "creation is a process of struggle between a writer and life," that is, "the complete fusion of subjectivity and objectivity" and "unity of self and object" (1941), and other extremely reactionary subjective idealist creation methods. Like Hu Feng, he regarded Western bourgeois literature as the supreme ancestor. Hu Feng's reactionary literary thoughts were all in Zhou Yang, but he was more cunningly disguised. In 1952, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and others held a so-called "criticism" of Hu Feng, praising Hu Feng at the meeting as "politically supporting Comrade Mao Zedong" and "in major political directions and struggles, standing with the Party," even praising this counter-revolutionary leader as a "non-Party Bolshevik." This completely exposed that Zhou Yang and his gang were consistent with Hu Feng in "political direction." Hu Feng's counter-revolutionary clique attacked Zhou Yang and others, not because they were attacking Zhou Yang's set of ideas. As pointed out in the editorial note of the People's Daily in the "Third Batch of Materials on the Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique": "The attack on a few people by counter-revolutionaries is only their pretext," their target of attack is our Party, Mao Zedong Thought. But Zhou Yang took advantage of the anti-Hu Feng struggle to make a move. He seized the opportunity of Hu Feng attacking him, Zhou Yang, to disguise himself as if he were the representative of Mao Zedong's literary line. From then on, he became arrogant. From then on, he more brazenly used the tactic of waving the red flag to oppose the red flag. In fact, this was a political speculation, a big deception.

The fox's tail cannot be hidden. Sure enough, before the revolutionary gunpowder of the criticism of Hu Shi and Hu Feng had dissipated, Zhou Yang hurriedly pulled the criticism and struggle against the bourgeoisie to the right. In November 1955, Zhou Yang wrote an article titled "In Memory of 'Leaves of Grass' and 'Don Quixote'." At that time, Comrade Mao Zedong's report criticizing right-opportunism on the issue of agricultural cooperation had been published, and China's countryside was in the midst of a great socialist upsurge. Comrade Mao Zedong called on literary and artistic workers to go to the countryside, to the fiery mass struggles, to write about "tens of thousands" of heroic figures; Zhou Yang, however, opposed this and enthusiastically advocated the high moral principles of Don Quixote, that is, bourgeois moral principles; he especially enthusiastically praised the 19th-century American bourgeois poet Whitman, asking writers to take him as an "example" of "participating in the struggle." He also lifted out a kind of "new type of person" from Whitman's works as a "shining example" for the Chinese people. Look:

Whitman's strange contribution is that he created a shining image of "man" in his poems. After reading his poems, people seem to be able to see a Whitman-style person, a new type of person, with a healthy body, a broad chest, a sublime ideal, a labor-creating hand, and always optimistic.

Whitman-style people, it can be said, are a new type of person, a shining example worthy of our learning and imitation.

Here, Zhou Yang used the deceptive phrase "labor-creating hand" to make it seem as if Whitman was singing the praises of the working people. No, the "man" praised in "Leaves of Grass" is not some abstract person, nor is it the working people, but the incarnation of American bourgeoisie. We found out that in an article published by Zhou Yang in the Jiefang Daily in Yan'an on November 1941, he had already praised American bourgeoisie. At that time, he directly said that the "Whitman-style person" he admired and praised was "a typical American bourgeoisie full of confidence, physically robust, and broad-minded." How disgusting! How disgusting! To praise the narrow-mindedness of bourgeois individualism as "broad-minded," isn't it embarrassing? At the time when six hundred million workers and peasants were rising up to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce, at the time when socialist heroes were emerging in their tens of thousands, Zhou Yang once again praised the reactionary and hypocritical "democracy and freedom" of the bourgeoisie as a "sublime ideal," took Whitman as an "example" of "participating in the struggle," called the "typical American bourgeoisie" a "new type of person," and a "shining example," and praised the knightly morality of Don Quixote as a "high moral principle," asking the people to "learn and imitate." Isn't this openly opposing Mao Zedong Thought? Isn't this a fierce counterattack on the earth-shaking socialist revolution of six hundred million workers and peasants? Isn't this to make the urban and rural bourgeoisie and the right-opportunists within the Party "always optimistic," firmly resist socialist transformation, and insist on the capitalist road?

This is not enough. Following the praise of Western bourgeoisie, in March 1956, Zhou Yang could not wait to seal five so-called "masters of contemporary linguistic art" in his report "The Task of Building Socialist Literature." He presented the crown of "master" with both hands, showing that he was a loyal agent of bourgeois "authorities." This was also learned from abroad. This is to command the proletariat to kneel down and surrender to bourgeois "authorities," this is a fierce counterattack on Comrade Mao Zedong's repeated instructions. This hat silenced many people. When in 1958 and 1959, some revolutionary "small figures" broke through Zhou Yang's ban, daring to risk being beaten, and criticized a few of these "masters," Zhou Yang immediately came out to protect these "masters," using the most venomous language to attack the critics. In February 1962, in his speech to "old playwrights," he angrily refuted, "Some people are not satisfied with some writers being called masters of linguistic art, saying it is flattery.... Do we need to learn language? Do we need to learn from the masters?" Isn't this to make young people die-heartedly become slaves of bourgeois "masters"? Even a little "dissatisfaction" with the bourgeoisie is not allowed, this is extremely arrogant.

The fourth major struggle was the great struggle to smash the arrogant attack of the bourgeois rightists in 1957. This struggle took place after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of ownership in our country's economic front. The great outbreak and spread of international revisionism after the "20th Congress" of the CPSU directly promoted the development of the revisionist tide within the country. During this period, Zhou Yang published a series of speeches and articles, providing spiritual weapons for the arrogant attack of the bourgeois rightists.

In March 1956, just after the "20th Congress" of the CPSU, Zhou Yang bluntly said at the literary and artistic work symposium:

We must definitely learn from capitalist countries. We do not only learn from the Soviet Union, but also from the progressive arts of capitalist countries.... For example, "Madame Curie" is a very good film, both in terms of thought and art, it is very high, this is an American film from more than ten years ago, although it does not directly promote communism, it is the worldview of communism, Madame Curie's worldview and ours communists' worldview are consistent. Therefore, we should establish a closer relationship with the progressive literature and art of capitalist countries... We should absorb their good things, in this process, we will influence them, and they will also influence us.

This is a plan for "peaceful evolution." "Madame Curie" is a reactionary film shot during Roosevelt's presidency in the United States. It propagates the reactionary views of bourgeois humanitarianism, pacifism, individual struggle, fame and fortune, class reconciliation, and the activities of scientists are above class and above politics, serving "all mankind," actually serving the monopolistic bourgeoisie to extract high profits. The American monopolistic bourgeoisie produced this "biographical film" to use a more concealed form to whitewash the bourgeoisie, "influence" and corrupt the American working people, making them give up the path of class struggle and fantasize about climbing to the upper layer of capitalist society, with extremely evil intentions. It has a greater deceptive effect than those pornographic films and "Westerns." Zhou Yang treasures it as a gem, praising it as "progressive art," wanting to do what the American imperialists want to do but have not done, that is, to use Western bourgeois reactionary art to "influence us," making our art become revisionist art with a socialist facade, selling capitalist dog meat, serving to cultivate new bourgeois elements. Comrades, just look at how many bad films have been produced under the control of Zhou Yang and his gang in recent years, and how closely these bad films are related to Western bourgeois art, you will understand the result of learning from such "progressive films" from the United States.

Zhou Yang said, "Madame Curie's worldview and our communists' worldview are consistent." This is a great invention. You and the bourgeois worldview talk about "consistency," which shows that your gang of "communists" is fake communism, that is, revisionism. Isn't this exposing one of your big secrets? Look at the authorities in the field of natural science who walk the capitalist road, aren't they the same as Zhou Yang, everywhere talking about "consistency" with the bourgeois reactionary worldview?

Soon, Zhou Yang, in the September 26, 1956, issue of the People's Daily, published another article titled "Let Literature and Art Play a Great Role in the Great Cause of Building Socialism." This is a bourgeois reactionary program against socialism, this is a declaration of war against the Party and Mao Zedong Thought.

In the article, Zhou Yang fiercely opposed "vulgarization," "simplification," "rigid rules," and "propaganda effect," believing that the Party's "dogmatism," "sectarianism," and "simple and violent attitude towards literary and artistic work" have "seriously restricted the creative freedom of writers and artists." Freedom has class content. Abstract "creative freedom" is a bourgeois anti-Party slogan. In a class society, there is only class freedom, not classless freedom. With the freedom of the proletariat and the working people to carry out dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, there is no freedom for the bourgeoisie and all reactionaries to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. With the freedom of the bourgeoisie to be anti-Party and anti-socialist, there is no freedom for the proletariat and the working people to carry out socialist revolution and construction. Zhou Yang's demand for "creative freedom" from the Party is to fight for the bourgeoisie's anti-Party and anti-socialist freedom, to let the ghosts and snakes remove their "restraints" and freely carry out counter-revolutionary activities against Mao Zedong Thought and socialism. The so-called "dogmatism" and "rigid rules" that Zhou Yang attacked are the fundamental principles of proletarian literature and art expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"; he attacked the "propaganda effect," which is to oppose literature and art propagating the worldview of the proletariat, that is, communism. The two anti-Party slogans of "creative freedom" and so-called "anti-dogmatism" later became the main weapons of the bourgeois rightists' arrogant attack in the literary and artistic circles. Until 1962 and 1963, weren't there still people using the old tune of "respecting creative freedom" to incubate various weeds?

The more fiercely the bourgeoisie attacks the proletariat, the more Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary true face is exposed. Just when the bourgeois rightists were launching an arrogant attack on the proletariat, reaching its peak, on April 9, 1957, Zhou Yang published a speech in Wenhui Daily, joyfully cheering "the opening of plays is a big event in the opera circle," cheering for the demons dancing on the stage; strongly praising the poisonous weeds brought from the Soviet revisionists by rightists like Liu Binyan, believing that "works that sharply expose and criticize the negative phenomena in life are increasingly attracting people's attention." In April, Zhou Yang held a series of meetings, stirring up trouble, fanning the flames, opposing the so-called "spring chill," demanding "spring warmth," inciting the rightists to fight for the arrival of "spring," that is, the restoration of capitalism. On May 13, in a report, he madly slandered Communist Party members as "acting like spies" and "like wood," strongly praising the Wenhui Daily, which had become the mouthpiece of the Zhang-Rao Alliance, for "having the guts to set fire." He said, talking about killing hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members, "it is not necessarily a counter-revolutionary." The fangs are fully exposed. This fully proves that he is a big rightist who escaped the net.

As soon as the anti-rightist struggle began, Zhou Yang, who played the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor, immediately changed his stance, skillfully transforming himself, hiding his big rightist ugly face. At the beginning of the rectification, Zhou Yang and the responsible person of the old Central Propaganda Department were very enthusiastic and actively advocated for the rehabilitation of Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and Feng Xuefeng's anti-Party clique, wanting to remove their anti-Party hats, directly pointing the spearhead at the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. However, as soon as the anti-rightist struggle began, Zhou Yang immediately used the criticism of Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and Feng Xuefeng to disguise himself as a leftist, pretending to be "consistently correct" to summarize the anti-rightist struggle in the literary and artistic circles. In the article "A Great Debate on the Literary and Artistic Front," he divided "us" into "two kinds of people," one kind is "not in one heart with the Party," "not willing to reform oneself according to the spirit of collectivism"; the other kind is he, Zhou Yang, saying that he has "abandoned the burden of individualism" and "is in one heart with the Party." Compared with those vicious rightist speeches, this two-faced tactic is so despicable! Last time, in the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, Zhou Yang used the two-faced tactic to make a move; this time, in the struggle against the Ding Ling, Chen Qixia, and Feng Xuefeng anti-Party clique, Zhou Yang again used the two-faced tactic to make a move. He used these two speculations to cover up his crimes, sheltering a group of rightists and traitors to pass the inspection, placing his black line's gang in various leading positions in the literary and artistic circles, expanding his anti-Party and anti-socialist forces. This is not enough, he also took the opportunity to reverse the verdict, falsifying his history of executing Wang Ming's right-opportunism in the 1930s, proposing the slogan of "national defense literature" to slander Lu Xun as "sectarianism." Turning over the palm, turning over the back of the hand, how many tricks did he play!

Some people like to write trilogies. Looking at it as a whole, Zhou Yang's tricks are also a trilogy: fiercely attacking the Party and Mao Zedong Thought; then immediately using false confessions or disguising as active to stand on the correct side; then launching a counterattack and new attacks. Zhou Yang's so-called "consistently correct" history is a history of counter-revolutionary two-faced traitors. However, the law of class struggle is not subject to human will. Zhou Yang passed through these four major struggles, and in the fifth major struggle, the trilogy was not completed, his counter-revolutionary revisionist face was completely exposed, and was thoroughly pierced by the sword of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A Great Exposure in Stormy Waves

The history since the proposal of the general line of socialist construction in 1958 is the history of the deepening and development of the socialist revolution in our country. During this period, the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, guided by Marxism-Leninism, waged two major struggles against the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, that is, the struggle in 1959 and the recent struggle. In the struggle, our socialist cause has achieved unprecedented great victories.

In this great storm of class struggle, the leaders of the old Central Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee, including Zhou Yang, further exposed their counter-revolutionary revisionist faces. Zhou Yang thought that his power was greater, his political capital was more, and with the support of the Khrushchev-like ambitious men in the old Beijing Municipal Committee and the support of the figures proposing the bourgeois reactionary line, he could be more arrogant. Under such an estimate, he discarded his disguise and blatantly showed his counter-revolutionary true face, more viciously, more crazily, and more arrogantly attacking the Party, the proletarian dictatorship, and Mao Zedong Thought.

In January 1959, the Khrushchev revisionist clique convened the 21st Congress of the CPSU. Khrushchev, at the congress, maliciously slandered and attacked our general line, people's communes, and the Great Leap Forward. Under the support of the modern revisionist clique of Khrushchev, the right-opportunist anti-Party clique, claiming to be Hai Rui, proposed a thoroughly revisionist program at the Lushan Conference, dreaming of overthrowing the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and pulling our country back to the dark road of capitalism. In this process, Zhou Yang carried out a large number of counter-revolutionary activities, actively serving the political needs of the right-opportunist anti-Party clique.

In February 1959, Zhou Yang published an article titled "Speech at the Symposium of Propaganda Cadres in Luoyang" in the February issue of "Mudan." He said that after the criticism in 1958, "there is a suppressed mood," and now it should be reversed, "to make everyone dare to speak, dare to express different opinions." "Everyone" is divided by class, what class of people does Zhou Yang want to mobilize? It is a small group of bourgeois rightists. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism, are either you crush me or I crush you. It is either the proletariat and the broad revolutionary people being "suppressed" by the bourgeoisie, or the bourgeoisie being "suppressed" by the proletariat and the broad revolutionary people. With class antagonism existing, there is fundamentally no society of "everyone" being equal and "everyone" not being "suppressed." The proletarian dictatorship implements the broadest democracy for the broad revolutionary people and implements resolute dictatorship over a small group of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Only by implementing dictatorship over the enemy can the democratic rights of the people be guaranteed. Zhou Yang's so-called "everyone dares to speak" is to bring back those ghosts and snakes that have been criticized, allowing only them to "speak" to attack Mao Zedong Thought, to attack the Party's general line, and not allowing the proletariat to "speak" to criticize them. "We should also let a few people speak, because they represent a certain social force." This is to confuse black and white. For the so-called "majority" and "minority," class analysis must be done. The steadfast leftists and the stubborn rightists are both minorities. The rightists are an extreme minority. The leftists win over and unite the middle forces to become the majority. You, Zhou Yang, ruthlessly oppress the proletarian leftist "minority," but support the extreme "minority" of bourgeois rightists to seize power, this is obviously to let them seize the power of the revolutionary people.

In early spring 1959, Zhou Yang, in order to implement his reactionary program of inciting ghosts and snakes to "dare to speak," recommended the theme of "Hai Rui's Memorial" to Zhou Xinfang and provided specific materials. He told Zhou Xinfang: "Now 'everyone' does not dare to speak, performing such plays is necessary." The "everyone" in the private conversation of the two counter-revolutionaries became "everyone." This "everyone" is the extreme minority of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists that they represent. He wanted to use "Hai Rui's Memorial" to encourage the right-opportunists and all ghosts and snakes. In 1959, he propagandized the "spirit of Hai Rui" everywhere and widely mobilized the cadres and performers of various art troupes coming to Beijing to require them to "choose Hai Rui and Bao Zheng" as the main characters of "writing historical plays today." Didn't Wu Han say that writing anti-Party "Hai Rui plays" also needs to be "a chessboard across the country"? The director of this "chessboard" is Zhou Yang.

In February 1959, Zhou Yang, at the creative work symposium, fiercely attacked the Great Leap Forward, obsequiously calling the reactionary art of modern revisionism "international standard." He cursed our Party, saying: "Having one thousand tons of steel, it is considered great, even the Soviet Union is not in our eyes." The great five hundred million Chinese people have the revolutionary winds of five continents and class brothers from all over the world in their eyes, daring to despise all reactionaries in the world, including American imperialism and modern revisionism, daring to fight against all demons and monsters in a head-on struggle, despising them, crushing them, and defeating them. Zhou Yang's eyes only have a few revisionist fox and dog gangs, of course, he has to bark at the fearless Chinese people. He also attacked our Party for "violating internationalism." This proves that his so-called "internationalism" is to regard revisionism as the "father party," following the ass of Soviet modern revisionism, step by step. This is completely opposed to proletarian internationalism and is the slave mentality of the bourgeoisie.

In June and July 1959, Zhou Yang made a speech at the cadre symposium of the Second National Military Literary and Art Performance Conference. This report was in complete harmony with the counter-revolutionary line proposed by the right-opportunist clique at the Lushan Conference. He slandered our praise of the Great Leap Forward as "putting on powder," as "misusing the enthusiasm of the masses"; he attacked the mass movement, cursing the singing of revolutionary songs as "old women singing, no one listens"; he cursed the laboring people as unworthy of writing poetry because "writing poetry originally requires inspiration"; he cursed "middle school students are little kids, twelve or thirteen years old," fundamentally having no right to be concerned with politics, if they are to learn politics, it is "vulgar to understand serving politics." As soon as he talked about the Great Leap Forward, as soon as he talked about the mass movement, including the mass movement of workers, peasants, and soldiers seizing culture, he sneered, gestured, and did his best to ridicule and attack, this is out of his bourgeois nature of hating socialism and hating revolutionary masses. Such a person standing against the mass movement, no matter how high his position, will eventually be beaten to a pulp. The facts mercilessly refuted Zhou Yang. Today, not only from "old women" to young people, everyone is singing revolutionary songs in unison, "twelve or thirteen-year-old" "middle school students" and elementary school students are also actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with unprecedented enthusiasm, launching a comprehensive offensive against the bourgeoisie!

In this report, Zhou Yang also arrogantly attacked, saying: "In the past ten years," have we had our own "scientific works"? Zhou Yang wanted to wipe out the great development of Mao Zedong Thought in various aspects in the ten years since liberation, which is truly "a small ant shaking a big tree, laughable and self-deluding." Zhou Yang, you listen carefully: from 1949 to 1959, in the past ten years, the Party Central Committee published the brilliant "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," becoming the compass for the revolution of our country and the people of the world, is this not a "scientific work"? In the past ten years, in politics, military, philosophy, culture, economy, and Party building, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China," "On the Issue of Agricultural Cooperation," "On Ten Major Relationships"... and other great epoch-making Marxist-Leninist works, further brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, is this not a "scientific work"? In the past ten years, Comrade Mao Zedong personally led the great struggles on the ideological front, writing famous articles such as "We Should Pay Attention to the Discussion on the Film 'Wu Xun'" and "The Bourgeois Orientation of Wenhui Daily Should Be Criticized," including the important instructions mentioned in the first part of this article that directly criticized you, Zhou Yang, is this not a "scientific work"? Isn't your counter-revolutionary face clear?

In fact, once exposed, your so-called "scientific works" are nothing but the stinking, long-winded, patchwork "regulations," "manuals," and "textbooks" of modern revisionism. They are the hollow, pompous boasts of those who are "sharp-tongued, thick-skinned, and empty-headed." You have eyes only for the foreign gods of revisionism. The invincible science of proletarian revolution, Mao Zedong Thought, and the living philosophy and science of the broad masses who grasp Mao Zedong Thought, you oppose all of it with madness. This fully exposes the counter-revolutionary, revisionist nature of the old Propaganda Department clique. This evil must be condemned by the entire Party and exterminated by the entire nation!

From 1961 to 1962, the forces of capitalism and feudalism within the country launched an attack on socialism, reaching a peak. Modern revisionists, in collusion with American imperialism and reactionaries from various countries, intensified their blockade, encirclement, slander, infiltration, and subversion of our country and our Party. Demons and ghosts emerged one after another, and the tide of revisionism surged. Zhou Yang not only actively organized the "ghosts and snakes" in the literary and artistic circles to prepare public opinion for the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique's conspiracy to seize the Party, the army, and the government; he was also a mad, red-eyed leader who personally took the lead. He convened numerous professional meetings, issuing one revisionist manifesto after another; he also traveled all over the country, in Shanghai, Changchun, Hangzhou, Dalian, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and everywhere else, holding meetings and giving speeches, fanning the flames and stirring up trouble, inciting and plotting with the "ghosts and snakes" to seize power, overturn cases, oppose Chairman Mao, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought. A batch of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements in the literary and artistic circles almost all received their passes from the Zhou Yang clique and acted according to Zhou Yang's signal flares. All dying reactionary classes, in their greed for profit, blindly expose themselves, so that the revolutionary people can see their true colors and rise up to destroy them. Below, we will highlight a few prominent aspects:

Zhou Yang fiercely opposed and cursed Mao Zedong Thought. Zhou Yang has always opposed Mao Zedong Thought, but in the past, he always used the two-faced tactics of revolutionaries to disguise himself. After 1961, he thought the situation was favorable for him, and the plot of the bourgeoisie to restore capitalism was about to succeed, so he boldly discarded his disguise and came out to curse openly.

In February 1961, Zhou Yang went to Shanghai and at a symposium, he attacked a play for "directly expressing the phrase 'Thank Chairman Mao,'" saying it was not enough to say it once, but three or four times. Thanking Chairman Mao, thanking the Communist Party, and always following Chairman Mao and the Party, this is what tens of millions of Chinese laborers shout from the bottom of their hearts, and it is the top priority that every laborer liberated from the oppression of the exploiting classes will never forget. Why do you, Zhou Yang, hate it so much? This fully reveals Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary class nature.

In March 1961, Zhou Yang went to Fujian to curse Mao Zedong Thought. He said: "Mao Zedong Thought is a red line. Too much of it is not a red line but red cloth. Politics is the soul, the soul does not occupy space, it comes and goes without a trace." Turning Mao Zedong Thought into a "red line" that "comes and goes without a trace" and "does not occupy space," isn't this clearly trying to drive Mao Zedong Thought out of every field and let revisionist, capitalist thoughts take the lead? This extremely venomous black talk, he spoke everywhere, over and over again, who knows how many times.

In June 1961, at the literary and artistic work symposium, Zhou Yang threatened: "Do not always propagandize support for Chairman Mao on radio and television." This is the black talk from the old Propaganda Department's hell. This fully reveals his counter-revolutionary face. You oppose propagating "support for Chairman Mao," so who do you want to propagate "support" for? Isn't it to elevate a small group of people who are despised by the entire Party and the entire nation to power, to achieve counter-revolutionary restoration? Your scheme can only end in a tragic outcome.

In July 1962, he went to the Northeast again to oppose "talking about Chairman Mao every day." We must talk about Chairman Mao every day, read Chairman Mao's books every day, review Chairman Mao's instructions every day, and learn Mao Zedong Thought every day. "Talking about Chairman Mao every day," all the "ghosts and snakes" would have no room to sneak in, and as soon as they come out, they would be exposed, and as soon as they move, they would be caught.

Zhou Yang is a counter-revolutionary revisionist who hates Mao Zedong Thought to the bone. Those grand words are all lies. The above materials are not enough to show how reactionary this person is?

Zhou Yang fiercely advocated for the rehabilitation of all "ghosts and snakes," counterattacking the revolutionary people, and inciting and organizing the various counter-revolutionary elements and bourgeois "authorities" who had been overthrown in the past to attack the Party.

On March 19, 1961, the "Three Family Village" counter-revolutionary clique's "Night Talks in Yan Mountain" began. Only a week later, on March 26, the "Literary Gazette" immediately threw out a special article titled "The Problem of Themes." This article is a thorough counter-revolutionary revisionist literary manifesto. It was written under the guidance and instruction of Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han, and carefully revised by them. This article put forward a provocative slogan: "Use all means to open up the literary path."

What "literary path" do they want to "open"? There is no abstract "literary path." Between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, it is a life-and-death struggle. "Opening" the "literary path" of socialism means blocking the "literary path" of capitalist reactionary literature; "opening" the "literary path" of capitalist, feudal reactionary literature means blocking the "literary path" of socialist literature. They say, "opening the literary path" is to "help people understand the diversity of the world, the laws of history, and the complexity of life." "Not to impose any restrictions" is the counter-revolutionary slogan of the Petofi Club. Anything exists under certain conditions, and anything that exists without "any restrictions" does not exist. The question is whether it is revolutionary restrictions or counter-revolutionary restrictions, progressive restrictions or reactionary restrictions. Proletarian literature must serve proletarian politics, it must accept the restrictions of proletarian politics, and consciously consider the issue of themes from the political interests of the proletariat; not accepting these restrictions means accepting the restrictions of bourgeois politics and becoming bourgeois literature. The proliferation of poisonous weeds such as "borrowing from the past to criticize the present," "worshipping foreigners and denigrating China," and "departing from the classics and writing about intermediate characters" is the result of bourgeois counter-revolutionary political restrictions. Exposing the bourgeois idealist deception in the issue of "restrictions" is to make people see clearly that Zhou Yang's so-called "not to impose any restrictions" is actually to demand that literature not be restricted by the six political standards, not be restricted by serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to let emperors, generals, talents, beauties, and various poisonous weeds dominate the literary world, to carry out a counter-revolutionary great restoration.

Their so-called "diversity of the world" is actually only one thing, which is to beautify and sing the praises of the various "diverse" ugly appearances of the decaying and declining landlord class, bourgeois class, and their intellectuals. In Zhou Yang's eyes, creating proletarian heroes and singing the praises of the boundlessly magnificent lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers are "narrow" and "monotonous," only by vigorously describing the decadent lifestyle of the bourgeoisie can it be called "diverse," and only then can there be some "enjoyment of beauty." Their so-called "complexity of life" is also very simple, which is the class reconciliation theory and class capitulationism in revisionist literature, the filthy methods of beautifying traitors, lackeys, hoodlums, and landlords, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in revisionist literature, and the disgusting brushstrokes of appreciating the dark psychology and spiritual split of the exploiting class in revisionist literature! In 1959, Khrushchev shamelessly praised Sholokhov, saying that the "great significance" of "A Man's Fate" was "to express the complex and rich spiritual world of ordinary people." The echoers of Khrushchev want us to write about the "complexity of life," isn't this to align with the traitor literature of Sholokhov and the like?

Zhou Yang vigorously promoted the black goods of modern revisionism and put forward the revisionist slogan of "national literature." Starting in October 1961, the 22nd Congress of the CPSU openly declared the "national state" and "national party," blatantly exposing their traitorous faces of replacing proletarian dictatorship with bourgeois dictatorship. Zhou Yang quickly responded. He took the opportunity of the 20th anniversary of the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in May 1962 to play another trick of waving the red flag to oppose the red flag. He gathered his bourgeois "authorities" in Beijing, under the guise of "writing articles" and "summarizing experiences," launched a high tide of opposition to the Mao Zedong literary line. This group of people, under the leadership of Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han, lived like aristocratic lords, plotting all day how to suppress the leftists, how to oppose the Party, socialism, and Chairman Mao, and did many dirty deeds that could not be seen. Finally, they threw out a batch of big poisonous weeds such as "The Unity, Tempering, and Improvement of the Literary and Artistic Team" (editorial of the "Literary Gazette"), "The Fighting and Victorious Twenty Years" (He Qi Fang), "Several Problems in Creating Characters" (Chen Huang Mei), and "A Monologue on the Problem of Film Innovation" (Qu Bai Yin), which carried out a comprehensive and extremely vicious distortion and attack on the Mao Zedong literary line. Zhou Yang personally took charge of an editorial of the "People's Daily." On March 15, Zhou Yang gave detailed instructions on the content of the "editorial" at a meeting, setting the tone. He then carefully revised it. This article, published under the name "Serving the Broadest Masses of the People," was centered on using Khrushchev's "national literature" to replace proletarian literature, using "serving the entire people" to distort the Mao Zedong literary direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

"National literature" is Zhou Yang's long-standing revisionist thought. He has repeatedly put forward revisionist slogans such as "national literature" and "national culture." After the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, he thought he had a foreign master to rely on, and with the approval of the leader of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, he boldly turned this slogan into a manifesto against the Party and socialism, and imposed it on the entire Party in the form of an editorial of the "People's Daily."

The article says: "The entire people within the people's democratic united front, with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main body, should all be the objects of our literary service and work." This is a very vicious distortion of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Our literature is first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." He also pointed out: "The problem of the object of work is the problem of who the literary work is for," "the receivers of literary works in the base areas are the workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary cadres." Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, with the workers, peasants, and soldiers as the object, this has been the fundamental direction of proletarian literature for twenty years, a class line, and the fundamental condition for determining the class nature of literature. Today, in the period of socialist revolution, it is even more so. Zhou Yang tries to use the so-called "united front" to replace the direction of literature for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and forcibly makes the bourgeoisie the object of our literary service. This is to distort the class nature of proletarian literature, making it a counter-revolutionary tool in the hands of the bourgeoisie. Zhou Yang treats the bourgeoisie and other revolutionary objects as "objects of work," intending to change our criticism of the bourgeoisie into praise for the bourgeoisie, using this line of "national literature" to overturn the Mao Zedong literary line, and to "open up the literary path" for the restoration of capitalism!

The article put forward a slogan: "Strengthen the connection between writers, artists, and the people." This is a revisionist slogan directly copied from Khrushchev. Khrushchev made a report titled "Literature and Art Should Maintain a Close Connection with People's Life." The so-called "Program of the CPSU" adopted by the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, which advocates fake communism, writes: "The main line of the development of literature and art is to strengthen the connection with people's life." Why does the Soviet revisionism so appreciate and advocate the slogan of "connecting with people's life"? Because this slogan is to abandon revolution, to elevate counter-revolution. First, it places writers and artists in a high position like aristocratic lords, only asking them to "connect" with "the people," completely opposing the integration with the workers, peasants, and soldiers; second, Khrushchev's so-called "people" are the "entire nation," the bourgeoisie, and the high-salary class. "Closely connecting with the people" is to closely connect with the bourgeoisie and the high-salary class, to serve the bourgeoisie; third, it abolishes the ideological reform of literary and artistic workers, allowing bourgeois writers to completely preserve their bourgeois worldview, and to write reactionary works against socialism with free hands; fourth, the Petofi Club can also become a form of "strengthening the connection with the people," making counter-revolutionary organizations and activities legal. Zhou Yang copies the main line of modern revisionist literature, intending to abolish Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions that literary and artistic workers "must long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to the fiery struggle," making the revisionist line further dominate the literary world in China.

Enough. This person is a report maniac, and we cannot list all the reactionary contents in his numerous big and small reports over the past few years. From this part of the facts, it is already enough to see Zhou Yang's true face. Zhou Yang, who usually appears in a two-faced guise, completely exposed his counter-revolutionary one-faced nature in this great storm of the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat. However, "extremes beget reversals," the counter-revolutionary faction's arrogant exposure of themselves provides the revolutionary faction with fatal ammunition, and Zhou Yang and his gang thus prepared the conditions for their own downfall by themselves.

Smash the stubborn resistance of the black line and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

Until the eve of the Party's Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1962, Zhou Yang was still actively participating in the conspiracy to oppose Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. He, together with a small group of anti-Party conspirators, actively supported and encouraged the publication of the anti-Party novel "Liu Zhidan" to rehabilitate the anti-Party elements Gao Gang. He personally met with the anti-Party elements who wrote this book, personally reviewed the novel, and praised the book as "a model" and "a benchmark." They tried to use this novel to wash away Gao Gang's anti-Party crimes, revise Party history, and overturn the correct conclusions of the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao on the anti-Party alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi.

Their anti-Party conspiracy was quickly exposed by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At the historic Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Comrade Mao Zedong once again emphasized the theory of contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society, and directly criticized Zhou Yang and others.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: Using novels to engage in anti-Party activities is a great invention. To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this.

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee once again gave a serious criticism and patient waiting to Zhou Yang and others. However, Zhou Yang once again used counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics to resist Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions. After the Eighth Plenum, he used his authority to rely on the support of anti-Party conspirators who had infiltrated into the Party, government, and army and held important positions, suppressing the leftists' counterattack, attempting to use two-faced tactics again to preserve the strength of the anti-Party, anti-socialist black line, and continue to struggle with the proletariat. Thus, on the vast ideological battlefield, a series of life-and-death struggles unfolded:

1. Just after the Eighth Plenum of the Party's Eighth Central Committee, Zhou Yang, in order to cover up his anti-Party crimes, hurriedly gave a so-called "transmission" on October 19, 1962, to the participants of the literary and artistic work symposium. On the one hand, he dressed himself up as a leftist who was "not very spiritually prepared"; on the other hand, he distorted the spirit of the Eighth Plenum, saying that the literary and artistic circles were "basically good," and that "anti-Party, anti-Marxist things were published... not much," trying to turn many poisonous weeds into fragrant flowers, to lull the revolutionary people. He also said, "Do not go to the other extreme." That is, do not criticize the bourgeoisie, do not uproot the poisonous weeds. The proletariat just began to counterattack, and he decided to resist to the end.

2. Immediately afterwards, in November 1962, with Zhou Yang's approval, instruction, and personal planning, a so-called "Confucius Discussion Meeting" was held in Shandong. This was Zhou Yang's counterattack on the revolutionary spirit of the Eighth Plenum, together with a large group of "ghosts and snakes." This was a black meeting where the rightists were rampant, staging an unprecedented spectacle of bowing to the feudal ancestors since liberation.

3. On New Year's Day 1963, Comrade Ke Qing Shi, based on the spirit of the Eighth Plenum of the Party's Eighth Central Committee and the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, proposed to the literary and artistic workers of Shanghai the initiative of "writing about the thirteen years," hoping that literary creation would strongly reflect the reality of socialist revolution and construction in the past thirteen years, and sing the praises of the heroes among the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This revolutionary initiative was immediately met with resistance and attack from the revisionist clique in the literary and artistic circles led by Zhou Yang. In April 1963, at the literary and artistic work conference held by the Propaganda Department, Zhou Yang organized Lin Mo Han, Shao Yuan Lin, and others to attack the slogan of "writing about the thirteen years" from small group meetings to large meetings. At this meeting, and then at the enlarged meeting of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles on April 27, Zhou Yang personally took the stage, talking about "no matter what themes are written, they can reflect the spirit of the times," and "do not think that only describing the present is the main theme." By the end of 1965, when he gave a report to young amateur authors, he sternly criticized what "three years ago" proposed "writing about the thirteen years," and "some comrades had expressed their inability to accept it." As if he was an active participant at that time. This is hypocrisy to the extreme! How can one be so shameless, using lies to boast about oneself?

4. In the first half of 1963, Comrade Mao Zedong sharply criticized the "ghost plays" and "emperors, generals, talents, and beauties," pointing out that the Cultural Department led by Zhou Yang, Qi Yan Ming, Xia Yan, and Lin Mo Han was the "Department of Emperors, Generals, Talents, and Beauties." In his two speeches on theatrical work in August and October 1963, Zhou Yang said that "advocating ghost plays is not necessarily a bourgeois idea," trying to resist Comrade Mao's criticism. Zhou Yang also, based on the fallacies of the anti-Party conspirators he relied on, openly proposed the so-called "division of labor theory," saying that "especially Beijing opera, is suitable for portraying emperors and generals," creating a theoretical basis for opposing revolutionary modern plays. He also boasted that "great achievements" had been made in theatrical reform, trying to cover up the evil of emperors, generals, talents, and beauties ruling the stage.

5. In September 1963, Zhou Yang specially convened a meeting including the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the heads of various newspapers and magazines, leading the attack on Comrade Tu Ben Yu's revolutionary article "Critique of Li Xiu Cheng's Autobiography." At the meeting, he shouted, "Li Xiu Cheng is a national hero, calling him a traitor is completely wrong." He directed Deng Tu and Qian Bo Zhan and others to come out to "refute Tu Ben Yu." This plot was discovered and stopped in time by Chairman Mao.

6. In October 1963, Zhou Yang made a report at the expanded meeting of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences. The third part of this report was about domestic tasks, not talking about the serious combat tasks on the ideological front at that time, but talking about "sorting out and studying historical heritage." He took out the black talk of the old Propaganda Department clique, fiercely attacking the so-called "using simple methods to stick labels." "Labels" refer to class analysis. At the meeting, he expelled the leftists and promoted a group of revisionists and bourgeois "authorities" to control the meeting. Deng Tu, who was to make a "report against revisionism," was to be the leader of "opposing revisionism." This is not a joke, but a political deal. Zhou Yang wanted to rely on anti-revolutionary conspirators, so he had to support their "Three Family Village."

7. In December 1963, in response to the reactionary rule of the anti-Party black line over the literary and artistic circles, Comrade Mao Zedong once again sharply pointed out: Various forms of art—drama, storytelling, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, many people, and socialist transformation in many departments has been ineffective for a long time. Many departments are still ruled by "dead people." Comrade Mao Zedong also said: Many communists enthusiastically advocate feudalist and capitalist art but do not enthusiastically advocate socialist art, isn't this strange? This instruction, together with Zhou Yang's boasting of the "great achievements" of theatrical reform, is a direct confrontation, a slap in the face, completely exposing Zhou Yang's reactionary position. Zhou Yang, however, continued to quibble, trying to sneak past.

8. Due to Zhou Yang and others repeatedly resisting the central instructions, in June 1964, Comrade Mao Zedong once again gave extremely sharp criticism to the revisionist leaders of the literary and artistic circles and gave a stern warning to Zhou Yang and others. This is the instruction mentioned at the beginning of this article, which was tampered with by Zhou Yang. Seeing that the situation was not good, Zhou Yang knew that continuing to resist would put himself in danger of being wiped out, so he carried out a so-called "rectification" in the Cultural Department. This was a deception of the masses, suppression of the leftists, protection of the bad elements, and cover-up of himself. In November 1964, Zhou Yang, in a so-called "report," used the opportunity of "criticizing" Xia Yan and others to boast that he had been working "under the guidance of the Chairman" since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. "My mistakes are different from your line mistakes," it is "lack of experience." He thought that by including himself, they could re-enact the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick of confessing a few words and becoming correct. He thought that by including himself, they could re-enact the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick of confessing a few words and becoming correct.

9. Under the personal care of Chairman Mao, in July 1964, the National Modern Beijing Opera Observation and Performance Conference was held. Zhou Yang, who had always opposed the revolutionary modern Beijing opera, and his backers suddenly acted enthusiastic. Zhou Yang again played the role of making a "summary speech." This speech, revised many times, although tried to make it seem more revolutionary, still showed its tail. He turned Xia Yan's distorted talk to the Hong Kong newspaper reporter about the revolution of Beijing opera into "underestimating the modern Beijing opera," and he also publicly declared: "It is not said that 'Xie Yao Huan' is entirely reactionary," trying to exonerate Tian Han's counter-revolutionary crimes.

10. In early 1965, under the call of Chairman Mao, the criticism of the reactionary views of Yang Xian Zhen and Zhou Gu Cheng and a batch of bad films was unfolding. Zhou Yang knew that if these criticisms were deeply developed, they would threaten his counter-revolutionary rule, and he did everything he could to extinguish them. He used the old counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics: on the one hand, he pretended to agree with the criticism; on the other hand, he watched for the opportunity, and as soon as there was a chance, he suddenly pulled the movement to the right. In late February, when a wave of criticism was rising, Zhou Yang and Lin Mo Han immediately, under the guise of "summarizing," gathered the heads of several major newspapers and magazines in Beijing for a talk, fiercely criticizing the articles criticizing various poisonous weeds published in this period as "firing blanks," "lacking analysis," "dogmatism," "guessing," "exaggerating," and "just putting on hats," and carried out a crazy counterattack. They also attacked and mocked the comments of the workers, peasants, and soldiers as "simplistic," "unable to replace expert comments," trying to suppress the criticism of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They openly said: "Criticizing Xia Yan, Tian Han and others, the past and the present should be separated, politics and academia should be separated." They also said that "some people have stopped talking... and that's it." A "separation" and a "that's it," this is a counterattack on the cultural revolution initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong, intending to force the criticism of the bourgeoisie to stop here. This tactic was indeed effective, and a large number of articles criticizing the bourgeoisie were thus firmly suppressed in their hell.

11. In September 1965, Zhou Yang and others thought they had suppressed the revolutionary masses and stabilized their positions, and they could perform the third act of the trilogy. They immediately impatiently launched a counterattack on the Party. They held a national conference of cultural bureau (hall) directors in Beijing, and Zhou Yang and his backers, together, took the stage, fiercely slandering Comrade Mao Zedong. They also invited Xia Yan, Yang Han Song, and others to the stage, sitting there arrogantly, continuing to rule over the proletariat. In his report, Zhou Yang repeatedly comforted them: "Do not always think about being criticized, being criticized more or less... being criticized too much or not enough, there will always be some." He hinted to them that being criticized too "much" and too "heavy" could be rehabilitated, as long as I, Zhou Yang, do not fall, you will not fall, and you can rise again in the future. He once again claimed to be "aware too late, corrected too slowly," a "cognitive problem." He thought that in this way, he could protect all of them and continue to rule over the proletarian dictatorship.

12. Finally, on November 29, 1965, Zhou Yang made this report at the National Conference of Active Amateur Literary Creators. This was nineteen days after the criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" opened, a serious moment when the proletarian leftists and the bourgeois rightists were fighting to the death. A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists from the old Beijing Municipal Committee, the old Propaganda Department, and the old Cultural Department, in order to firmly resist Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on criticizing the representatives of the bourgeoisie, carried out a series of anti-Party, anti-socialist conspiracies, fiercely attacking the leftists, protecting the rightists, and trying to extinguish the imminent proletarian cultural revolution. At this critical moment, Zhou Yang decided not to give an inch and resist Comrade Mao Zedong's thorough revolutionary instructions. In his report, he did not mention a word about the current stormy struggle, just as if there was no criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" in the world. In January 1966, Zhou Yang's report was officially published. At that time, more than a month had passed since he gave the report; during this period, the revolutionary people's criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui" had further unfolded, and a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists were making their last resistance. Zhou Yang, in his publicly published report, openly continued to tamper with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, expressing his determination to resist to the end.

Comrades, look! They resisted the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong so stubbornly! They harbored such deep hatred for the proletarian leftists! The flames of revolution are about to burn to their heads, and they would rather die than retreat! They were about to mobilize all the forces of the black line and the black den to counterattack!

When we review the history of literary struggles since liberation, we can clearly see the sharp struggle between the two lines: one is the Mao Zedong literary line, which is the red line. It is Comrade Mao Zedong who personally led all the major struggles, pushing the cultural revolution step by step forward, preparing for a long time, until the launch of the magnificent, all-out attack on the bourgeoisie, the proletarian cultural revolution participated in by hundreds of millions of people, digging deep into the lair of Zhou Yang and his gang. One is the anti-Party, anti-socialist bourgeois literary line, which is the black line. Its ringleader is Zhou Yang. Behind Zhou Yang is the recently smashed counter-revolutionary clique that conspired to seize the Party, the army, and the government. Hu Feng, Feng Xue Feng, Ding Ling, Ai Qing, Qin Zhao Yang, Lin Mo Han, Tian Han, Xia Yan, Yang Han Song, Qi Yan Ming, Chen Huang Mei, Shao Yuan Lin, and others are all figures within this black line. Although there are various quarrels and expulsions among the different factions within them, they are unanimous in one point: they oppose Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, oppose the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the anti-Party, anti-socialist bourgeois reactionary political stance. Zhou Yang, who "criticized" Hu Feng, also used Hu Feng's vicious language, which is because they are originally on the same side. Zhou Yang and his gang used various vile means such as one strike and one pull, granting titles and positions, recruiting and surrendering, and mutual flattery to recruit a group of traitors, counter-revolutionaries, rightists, and extreme individualists, placing them in various positions as anti-Party, anti-socialist tools. They also did everything they could to make the youth poisoned, turning them into the successors of the bourgeoisie, and sinfully dragging a group of young authors into the black den of anti-Party, anti-socialism. This black line controlled the cultural world, controlled various associations, and extended to various places, using the so-called "membership" system and the overlapping "associations" to raise a group of bourgeois writers, expelling and attacking the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and creating a large and small number of "Petofi Clubs." This black line serves the restoration of capitalism. Today, we must smash all their "Petofi Clubs," destroy their revisionist hell! We must seize the leadership of all literary and artistic units from the bourgeoisie, seize it completely! We must firmly destroy all the decayed capitalist and feudal relations!

Zhou Yang was not a self-proclaimed "Marxist theorist"? Because Zhou Yang usurped the leadership position of the Party in the cultural field and used the position of a party boss and a scholar boss to disguise himself as the representative of the Party in the literary and artistic field, constantly boasting about himself and intimidating others, creating such an illusion. Things develop as a process, and recognizing the essence of things through phenomena often requires a process of observation, and a period of time to allow the hidden essence to fully expose itself. This is not strange. Such situations have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. However, after the true faces of those "great figures" who oppose Mao Zedong Thought are exposed, looking back at their history, one can find the small essence from the vast illusion. Zhou Yang's public articles and internal speeches, if carefully examined, are full of reactionary fallacies and errors, full of holes, and easily exposed. As for Zhou Yang's so-called "literary theory," it is just a collection of chicken feathers and dog hairs copied from foreign books. What is so great about that?

Zhou Yang boasted that he came from the "liberated area"? In fact, in Yan'an, he was of the same kind as Wang Shi Wei, Ding Ling, Xiao Jun, Ai Qing, and other Trotskyites, traitors, and anti-Party elements. Zhou Yang was a bourgeois element who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. In the 1930s, Zhou Yang was an executor of the Wang Ming line and an opponent of the proletarian literary line represented by Lu Xun. In the early 1940s in Yan'an, he still stubbornly declared, "In aesthetics, I am a faithful follower of Chernyshevsky" ("Liberation Daily," July 17, 1941). He arrived at the revolutionary base, but he extremely hated the revolutionary base. From July 17 to 19, 1941, he published an anti-Party essay "Literature and Life Chat" in the "Liberation Daily," slandering and attacking "Yan'an also has its own circle, its own set. Everyone wears the same uniform, receives almost the same allowance... You walk on the road, you will hear from all directions the old revolutionary jargon hanging on people's mouths. How monotonous, no change at all!" He used the counter-revolutionary language of the bourgeois "opposition" to attack Yan'an for being "too narrow," "too rigid," "unable to accommodate oneself," and arrogantly demanded that "Yan'an must not be satisfied with its own set, but must strive to improve, making itself more extensive and inclusive" ("Liberation Daily," July 19, 1941). This is what was written in Yan'an, the holy land of the revolution in the hearts of all Chinese people, where Chairman Mao was! Such viciousness, what is the difference from Wang Shi Wei's tone! As soon as the proletariat took power, Zhou Yang's bourgeois nature exploded into anti-Party howls! "Inclusive of everything," that is to "include" the "ghosts and snakes"! Indeed, under the leadership of Zhou Yang's three anti-Party essays, a batch of counter-revolutionary strange works emerged, including Wang Shi Wei's "Wild Lily," Ding Ling's "Thoughts on March 8," and Ai Qing's "Understanding Writers, Respecting Writers." Zhou Yang's reactionary stance and thought received sharp criticism from Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." However, he always resisted Comrade Mao Zedong's criticism and never wanted to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This bourgeois reactionary essence, unrepentant after repeated lessons, developed into a comprehensive revisionist line in the period of socialist revolution.

Zhou Yang is a counter-revolutionary two-faced person. He was able to deceive some people for a long time, which has a lot to do with his two-faced tactics. We must learn to identify two-faced characters. Two-faced tactics are a strategy used by class enemies within the proletariat to fight against us. Under the strong dictatorship of the proletariat, they can only use the tactic of waving the red flag to oppose the red flag to survive. One side is dark, one side is bright, one set of words in front, one set of words behind, using Marxist phrases, peddling revisionist black goods, retreating when it is not advantageous, attacking when it is advantageous, using false confessions to hide, using real attacks to counterattack, recruiting and surrendering, forming factions, with the ultimate goal of overthrowing the proletarian dictatorship and restoring capitalism, this is their whole set of tactics. To identify such two-faced characters, one must look at their political stance in major and critical moments, especially when the bourgeoisie fiercely attacks the proletariat, and one cannot believe those surface articles that turn with the wind. To expose such two-faced characters, one must rely on mass movements. This time, the flames of the proletarian cultural revolution did not burn away Zhou Yang's disguise and expose his ugly soul?

Exposing Zhou Yang's black line, is the literary and artistic world all well and good? Not at all. Exposing it does not mean uprooting it, nor does it mean eliminating its influence; uprooting this black line, there will still be black lines in the future, and there will still be struggles. Class struggle, political struggle, will always be reflected in literature in one form or another. The road of struggle is still long. The true proletarian revolutionaries must, with the development of the situation, constantly put forward new and higher tasks of struggle for themselves, and must not become complacent or intoxicated because of the victory of a battle.

As Comrade Mao Zedong said: The proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution that touches people's souls. It touches people's fundamental political stance, touches the deepest part of people's worldview, touches the road each person has walked and will walk, and touches the entire history of the Chinese revolution. This is the greatest revolutionary change that humanity has never experienced, and it will forge an entire generation of staunch communists. The current situation is very good, but the road of struggle is tortuous. There will be setbacks, ups and downs, various illusions, and encounters with the counterattack and softening of reactionary forces. We must be prepared to fight several more rounds; but victory will definitely belong to the proletarian revolutionary leftists who grasp Mao Zedong Thought, are good at learning, unite the masses, and fight to the end. "Practice, cognition, practice, cognition again," as long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions and do it seriously, and are good at summarizing experience, making our cognition develop with the development of the objective process, we will be able to train a set of daring and good at revolution. The remnants of the old world, the various decayed institutions and spiritual shackles left by the exploiting class, will be washed away by the surging torrent of this cultural revolution. The Chinese people will be more united than ever under the great leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, striding forward with revolutionary steps, and creating a new world of communism that is red all over.

"The Secret History of the Forbidden City" is a thoroughly treacherous film. It began screening in Beijing in March 1950. On the one hand, it shamelessly advocates the slave mentality of kneeling and surrendering to foreign imperialism, beautifying the Guangxu Emperor and the monarchists within the landlord class, and crazily calling for relying on "foreigners" to "help the Emperor restore his throne and restore the imperial court"; on the other hand, it fiercely slanders the Boxers who bravely opposed imperialism as "murderers and arsonists" and "madmen," doing their utmost to defame them. This film is in tune with American imperialism, completely meeting the needs of American imperialism to invade China, and completely meeting the needs of the running dogs of American imperialism to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, and is in opposition to Comrade Mao Zedong's great call to "Abandon Illusions, Prepare for Struggle." However, after this treacherous film came out, due to the advocacy of a small group of bourgeois representatives within the Party, it was not only not criticized but was even praised as a "patriotic film." Those who execute the bourgeois reactionary line and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously obstructed the criticism of this film. They actually "love" the landlord bourgeoisie, they use the idealist historical view of the landlord bourgeoisie to observe problems, they are the true "monarchists," isn't this very clear? Among the "great figures" who advocated "The Secret History of the Forbidden City," there are those who put forward the bourgeois reactionary line in the current proletarian cultural revolution. Their anti-Mao Zedong Thought reactionary bourgeois worldview, their essence of protecting the exploiting class and hating the revolutionary mass movement, has been revealed since the early days of the country when they praised "The Secret History of the Forbidden City."

    评反革命两面派周扬
    姚文元
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，像大海的怒涛一样，猛烈地冲刷着那些阴暗的毒蛇的巢穴。
    轰！被反革命修正主义分子长期盘踞的旧中央宣传部这个阎王殿倒垮了。
    在最近举行的文艺界无产阶级文化大革命的大会上，江青同志指出：“旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部互相勾结，对党，对人民犯下的滔天罪行，必须彻底揭发，彻底清算。对于我们党内以反对毛主席为首的党中央的无产阶级革命路线为目标的资产阶级反动路线，也必须彻底揭发，彻底批判。”
    对旧中宣部周扬等人的揭发和清算，关系到用毛泽东思想总结几十年来的革命历史，关系到社会主义革命时期社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的历史，关系到党内以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线两条路线斗争的历史，关系到更深入地挖掘政治上资产阶级反党反社会主义的黑线，必须搞深搞透。
    周扬是一个典型的反革命两面派。他一贯用两面派手段隐藏自己的反革命政治面目，篡改历史，蒙混过关，打着红旗反红旗，进行了各种罪恶活动。他是我们现在和今后识别反革命两面派的一个很好的反面教员。他最后的一个公开报告，即一九六五年十一月二十九日，在全国青年业余文学创作积极分子大会上题名为《高举毛泽东思想红旗，做又会劳动又会创作的文艺战士》的报告，就是打着红旗反红旗的典型。
    这个报告，忠实地执行了反革命修正主义集团头目的旨意，极力抵制毛泽东同志关于批判资产阶级代表人物的指示。这个报告，在马克思主义词句的伪装下，对十六年来文化战线上的阶级斗争，进行了肆意的歪曲和捏造。这个报告，把周扬这个修正主义分子，伪装成毛泽东文艺路线的执行者，完全颠倒了历史。特别使人愤慨的是，周扬在这个报告里，十分卑鄙地篡改了毛泽东同志对于无产阶级文化革命的极为重要的指示。
    一九六四年六月，毛泽东同志对周扬和他控制下的全国文联和各个协会，提出了一针见血的批评，指出：这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成像匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。这是对以周扬为首的文艺界反党反社会主义黑线的一个严厉的批判和打击。这个指示彻底揭露了全国解放以来，旧中央宣传部领导人，包括周扬在内，执行的是一条反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的修正主义文艺路线；彻底揭露了文化战线上大多数的机关、团体和刊物，一直被修正主义集团所控制，成为资产阶级向无产阶级进行全面进攻的工具，必须进行夺权斗争；彻底揭露了周扬这伙文艺界的修正主义分子，正在为资本主义复辟准备舆论，一旦时机成熟，他们就要在赫鲁晓夫那样的野心家的导演下，演出裴多菲俱乐部式的反革命政变。
    毛泽东同志的这个指示，在一九六四年七月十一日当作正式文件发给了各级党组织，推动了全国的文化革命。但是，一贯抗拒毛泽东同志指示的周扬，竟敢在报告中把毛泽东同志的话明目张胆地篡改成：“他指出，一些重要文化部门的领导、一些文艺刊物，基本上不执行党的政策，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。”把毛泽东同志指出的“十五年来”这个长时间的期限删掉了，把毛泽东同志指出的“大多数”文化部门和刊物，减少成“一些”文化部门和刊物，千方百计掩盖这条反党反社会主义黑线的罪恶。毛泽东同志揭露他们这一伙人“做官当老爷”，就是当了资产阶级贵族老爷来专无产阶级和劳动人民的政，也被周扬删掉了。最不能容忍的是，他把毛泽东同志最重要的话，即指出周扬控制下的这些协会“最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成像匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体”这个精确的科学论断和严厉的政治警告，一刀砍掉，统统删去。在“高举毛泽东思想红旗”的伪装下，玩弄了一个篡改、歪曲、抗拒毛泽东思想的偷天换日的大阴谋。
    毛主席的这个指示，决不是周扬的黑手所能涂抹得了的。下面，我们将以毛主席的这个指示为指针，通过对十六年来阶级斗争历史的分析，用大量确凿的事实，来揭露周扬反革命两面派的真实面貌。
    一部反革命两面派的历史
    周扬在对青年业余作者的报告中，伪装出“一贯正确”的姿态，跳出来“总结”解放以来“五次大辩论、大批判”。他竟把自己打扮成是“全面地正确地执行毛泽东文艺路线”的代表者。
    这是假的。这是撒谎。这是颠倒黑白。这是在光天化日之下伪造历史。
    真相如何呢？
    请看周扬在历次思想战线上的大斗争前后的真实面貌：
    第一次大斗争，是一九五一年对电影《武训传》的批判。这次斗争发生在中华人民共和国建国初期。当时土地改革和镇压反革命运动正在全面展开，资产阶级同封建残余势力相勾结，向年轻的无产阶级专政发动了一场猛烈的进攻。他们抛出了《武训传》。这是一部狂热地歌颂地主阶级及其走狗，狂热地宣扬最无耻的奴才主义、投降主义，狂热地诬蔑农民革命斗争的极端丑恶的反革命电影。远在解放以前，国民党反动派的伪“中国电影制片厂”就动手拍制这部影片，他们没有来得及拍完，人民解放军的炮声响了。解放以后，周扬修正主义集团的另一个头目夏衍继承了国民党反动派未完成的事业，在他的直接领导下拍完了这部反革命电影。电影一放映，立刻就受到一批党内外资产阶级代表人物的吹捧，号召学习武训和“武训精神”，也就是要无产阶级像武训那样向地主阶级和资产阶级屈膝投降。毛泽东同志亲自发动了对《武训传》的批判。他在为五月二十日的《人民日报》写的一篇题为《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》的社论中，尖锐地指出了文艺界的一些“号称学得了马克思主义的共产党员”向资产阶级反动思想投降的错误，严肃地责问：“资产阶级的反动思想侵入了战斗的共产党，这难道不是事实吗？一些共产党员自称已经学得的马克思主义，究竟跑到什么地方去了呢？”
    毛主席所说的“一些共产党员”，为首的就包括周扬。周扬当时担任中央宣传部副部长，文化部党组书记。他自称“我自己很早就看了电影《武训传》”，这部电影是经过他批准后在全国范围放映的。这部反动电影一出来，立刻被毛泽东同志发现了。当时，中央有的同志通知周扬，《武训传》是一部宣传资产阶级改良主义的反动电影，必须批判，还没有说到毛泽东同志的意见，就被周扬顶了回来。周扬趾高气扬地摆出一副十足的贵族老爷架子，十分轻蔑地说：“你这个人，有点改良主义有什么了不起嘛！”
    五月二十日《人民日报》社论发表以后，在毛泽东同志的严厉责问下，周扬被迫出来做了几句假检讨。实际上他一直阳奉阴违，寻找机会反扑。一九五一年六月四日，《武训传》批判刚开始，周扬立刻就写了一封黑信给他的一员大将于伶，指示于伶“在思想斗争问题上”，“具体处理要慎重，仔细，不可急躁鲁莽”。并焦急地说：“我们最需要知道的是真实情况”。于伶当时窃踞了上海文化局副局长，他包庇和勾结着一批形形色色的牛鬼蛇神。所谓“慎重，仔细”，就是要于伶注意“仔细”保护资产阶级力量，保护那些披着文艺外衣的反革命分子；所谓“不可急躁鲁莽”，就是指示文化界的反革命修正主义分子尽量削弱毛主席批评中尖锐的政治内容，采取拖延的策略，以便把一场严重的阶级斗争，最后化为一个“认识”问题。周扬在信中加了圈的所谓“真实情况”，就是要收集保护资产阶级右翼的种种材料，进行反党活动。这是周扬一伙在《武训传》批判过程中的一次反党大阴谋。
    在毛泽东同志发起下，突破了周扬的重重抵抗，组织了一个武训历史调查团。这个团克服了周扬派来的他的秘书锺惦棐的怠工破坏，依靠广大群众开展了工作。这个团的调查结果，就是七月二十三日至二十八日在《人民日报》连续发表的《武训历史调查记》一文。这篇经过毛泽东同志修改的文章，以铁的事实揭开了武训这个大地主、大债主、大流氓的反动面目，为这场大辩论作了最好的总结。这时周扬见铁证如山，再抵抗下去不行了，立刻变换了策略，赶紧换一副面孔，出来写文章，捞资本。他在八月发表的文章中，先说了两句什么自己“并没有能够充分地认识和及早地指出它的严重的政治上的反动性”，然后摇身一变，出来做“系统的”总结，好像这场伟大斗争的领导者，不是别人，而是他周扬！
    当然，周扬对毛泽东同志的批评是决不甘心的。批判的高潮刚过去，周扬就迫不及待地站到第二次全国文学艺术工作者代表大会的讲坛上，发动反攻，为《武训传》批判“纠偏”。他在题名为《为创造更多的优秀的文学艺术作品而奋斗》的报告中，声色俱厉地说：“自电影《武训传》批判以后”，“我们的批评工作中发生了一些偏向”，“应当加以纠正”。接着就猛烈地攻击什么“从教条公式出发”的“一些粗暴的、武断的批评”，“一部分读者的偏激意见”（即广大工农兵的革命批评），再加上党的领导不“支持”所谓“创作事业”，“使不少作家在精神上感到了压抑和苦恼。这种情绪是需要设法转变的。”
    请看，周扬在这里“纠偏”纠得多么彻底！他实际上把由毛泽东同志发动的对反动电影《武训传》的批判彻底否定了，把工农兵的批评一把扼杀了，也把毛泽东同志对周扬等“号称学得了马克思主义的共产党员”的批判推翻了！无产阶级刚刚开始批判资产阶级，周扬就大喊大叫“苦恼”了，“压抑”了，这个资产阶级代表人物反映他那个阶级的呼声是多么敏锐啊！
    请看，《武训传》批判前后，周扬扮演的是一个什么角色！开头，他以文艺界“老头子”的身份，领着他那一伙放毒，大反毛泽东思想，大反以毛主席为首的党中央领导，抗拒毛泽东同志的指示。战斗一打响，他连忙来个假检讨，蒙混过去，欺骗党、欺骗人民。然后，他装出“正确”的姿态来“总结”斗争，把功劳算在自己账上。接着，他就逐步把运动拉向右转，向革命人民发动反攻倒算。同志们，请注意，周扬是玩弄反革命两面派的老手，抓住这一点，我们就可以看清楚周扬在各次斗争中的基本面貌。也可以看清楚其他已经揭露和尚未揭露的“两面人”的特征。
    第二次大斗争，是一九五四年对俞平伯的《〈红楼梦〉研究》和胡适反动思想的批判。这次斗争发生在我国社会主义改造深入展开的重要时期。随着党提出了社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业、资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的总路线，不甘心死亡的资产阶级加紧了对社会主义力量的进攻，并且加紧在党内寻找他们的代理人。党的七届四中全会彻底揭露了和粉碎了高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的篡党阴谋。斯大林逝世后，现代修正主义逆流开始泛滥。这种情况直接影响到我国文艺界，使党内外的一些资产阶级分子活跃起来。以周扬为首的文艺界修正主义集团，利用他们垄断的刊物和报纸，大力吹捧和支持资产阶级“权威”，对马克思主义的新生力量则采取了贵族老爷式的压制和打击。他们全力支持极端反动的胡适派的唯心论，毒辣地镇压一切起来批判资产阶级的人，为资产阶级抗拒社会主义改造服务。毛泽东同志看到了文艺界黑线专政的严重形势，又发动了对《〈红楼梦〉研究》和胡适反动思想的批判。
    一九五四年十月十六日，毛泽东同志在给中共中央政治局的同志和其他有关同志的一封信中，尖锐地深刻地批评了以“大人物”自命而镇压对资产阶级批判的“某些人”，他愤慨地说：事情是两个“小人物”做起来的，而“大人物”往往不注意，并往往加以阻拦，他们同资产阶级作家在唯心论方面讲统一战线，甘心作资产阶级的俘虏，这同影片《清宫秘史》和《武训传》放映时候的情形几乎是相同的。被人称为爱国主义影片而实际是卖国主义影片的《清宫秘史》①，在全国放映之后，至今没有被批判。《武训传》虽然批判了，却至今没有引出教训，又出现了容忍俞平伯唯心论和阻拦“小人物”的很有生气的批判文章的奇怪事情，这是值得我们注意的。
    毛泽东同志尖锐批评的以“大人物”自命而压制“小人物”的“某些人”，反对在《人民日报》转载批判俞平伯的文章的“某些人”，为首的就包括周扬，也包括丁玲、冯雪峰支配的《文艺报》。
    正是周扬，一贯执行一条吹捧资产阶级“权威”、压制马克思主义新生力量的反动路线。一九四九年六月三十日，他在《文汇报》发表的题为《论知识分子问题》的讲话中，就把资产阶级知识分子吹捧为“革命的领导力量之一”，说什么离开了他们“革命就搞不成”，胡说什么进城的工农干部没有知识，“这一方面的缺陷，就需要城市的知识分子来填补。”他又一再叫喊要“依靠作家、艺术家自己的团体”，用所谓“社会方式来领导艺术创作”（一九五三年《文艺报》第十九期），不许无产阶级插手资产阶级“权威”控制的“团体”。周扬就是这样把资产阶级“权威”、叛徒、反革命分子安排、“填补”到文化界的各界里，去作“领导力量”，压制一切革命者对他们的批判。
    正是周扬，直到一九五四年《〈红楼梦〉研究》批判展开前夕，还专门在《发扬“五四”文学革命的战斗传统》一文中，五体投地地吹捧资产阶级知识分子，什么“民主倾向”，什么“有思想、有才能”，什么有“抱负和理想”，什么“有良心的、正直的人”，……你们看，这不是简直把中国资产阶级知识分子捧上了天吗？
    正是周扬，还在这篇文章中大捧特捧“西方先进的科学和先进的文化思想”，这里的“西方”，是指欧美资产阶级的文化，就是形形色色反动的资产阶级唯心论和形而上学宇宙观，其中影响最大的就是胡适派的唯心论，即资产阶级实用主义。把资产阶级反动哲学说得那么神圣，这不是对俞平伯之流的资产阶级“权威”最大的撑腰吗？这不是十足地“甘心”作资产阶级代言人吗？
    正是周扬，在这场大斗争中又重演了一次反革命两面派的角色。战斗刚刚开始，周扬就尽力想把这场尖锐的政治思想斗争，化为一场所谓“纯”学术讨论。一九五四年十月二十四日，他在中国作家协会古典文学部召开的座谈会上，迫不及待地要人们去研究“包含复杂的内容”的所谓“学术思想上的问题”，开了一大批题目，要人们去搞烦琐考证。十月二十八日，《人民日报》根据毛泽东同志的指示，发表了质问《文艺报》编者的文章，公开揭露了文艺界某些领导人的资产阶级贵族老爷态度。周扬看看形势不妙，马上及时制造假检讨。一九五四年十二月八日，他在全国文联主席团和全国作协主席团扩大会议上，说什么“放弃了对资产阶级唯心论的批判和斗争”“是我们工作中最大的错误。我也就是犯了这种错误的。”等等。这个“检讨”，拆穿了说，不过是“错误人人有份”而已。他根本不想稍为清算一下自己反动的资产阶级政治立场，只是想借此蒙混过关。什么“我们”“进一步展开了对胡适的资产阶级唯心主义思想的批判”，贪天之功以为己功，不知人间有羞耻二字。人们都清楚：这个“我们”是不包括你周扬的。你的所谓“全面批判”不过是摇身一变的故技重演，这是为了保持你窃踞的领导地位，以便把斗争拉向右转，开展反攻倒算。到了一九六一年、六二年，你们不是连续发表了成百万字的曹雪芹死年考据、祖宗考据、大观园地址考据……等等奇谈怪论，登了整版整版的稀奇古怪的地图，为胡适派唯心论实行了一次大复辟吗？
    第三次大斗争，是一九五四年到一九五五年紧接着批判胡适而展开的反对胡风反革命集团的斗争。这是一场在以毛泽东同志为首的党中央亲自领导之下的肃清暗藏反革命分子的尖锐斗争。是对反革命势力的一个严重打击。周扬的思想同胡风思想本质上是一样的，他同胡风一样，反复鼓吹“艺术的最高原则是真实”（一九五二年），反对马克思主义世界观，反对毛泽东思想。他同胡风一样，反对文艺为工农兵服务的方向，反对作家深入到工农兵斗争中去，甚至狂妄地说“不去，也还是可以结合的”，“我们和工农是要分工的”（一九四九年），公然以贵族老爷自居。他同胡风一样，反对写重大题材，反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，大力鼓吹所谓“选择题材”上要有“完全自由”，要“最大限度地保证这种自由”（一九五三年）。他同胡风一样，主张资产阶级人道主义和人性论，反对阶级分析，用所谓“新的国民性的成长的过程”（一九四九年）之类人性论的语言，来歪曲劳动人民的阶级面貌和阶级性格。他同胡风一样，提倡“创作就是一个作家与生活格斗的过程”、就是“主观和客观完全融合”“物我一体”（一九四一年）之类极端反动的主观唯心论的创作方法。他同胡风一样，把西方资产阶级文艺奉作至高无上的祖师。胡风的反动文艺思想，周扬都有，只是伪装得更巧妙些。一九五二年，周扬、林默涵等人召开过一个所谓“批判”胡风的座谈会，在会上就吹捧胡风是“政治态度上拥护毛泽东同志”的，“在大的政治方向政治斗争上”，是“同党站在一起的”，甚至把这个反革命头目捧做“非党的布尔什维克”。完全暴露了周扬一伙同胡风“政治方向”上是一致的。胡风反革命集团所以要攻击周扬等人，并不是也不可能是攻击周扬的这一套。正如《人民日报》编者在《关于胡风反革命集团的第三批材料》的按语中指出的：“反革命分子的攻击少数人不过是他们的借口”，他们攻击的目标是我们的党，是毛泽东思想。可是周扬却利用反胡风斗争投了一个机，他抓住胡风攻击他周扬这个假象，把自己打扮成好像是毛泽东文艺路线的代表者。从此就神气起来了。从此就更加露骨地使用打着红旗反红旗的手段了。其实，拆穿了，这是一场政治投机，是一个大骗局。
    狐狸尾巴是藏不住的。果然，对胡适、胡风批判的革命硝烟还没有消失，周扬就急忙把对资产阶级的批判和斗争拉向右转。一九五五年十一月，周扬写了一篇《纪念〈草叶集〉和〈堂·吉诃德〉》的文章。当时，毛泽东同志坚决批判右倾机会主义的《关于农业合作化问题》的报告已经发表，中国农村正处于伟大的社会主义高潮中间。毛泽东同志号召文艺工作者到农村中去，到火热的群众斗争中去，大写“成千上万”的英雄人物；周扬却针锋相对地狂热地鼓吹堂·吉诃德的什么“高度的道德原则”，即资产阶级的道德原则；他特别狂热地吹捧十九世纪美国资产阶级诗人惠特曼，要作家把他当作“参加斗争”的“范例”。他还从惠特曼著作中抬出了一种“新型的人”，当作中国人民的“光辉榜样”。请看：
    惠特曼的奇异贡献是他在他的诗篇中创造了“人”的一种光辉形象。读了他的诗，人们就好像能够看见一种惠特曼式的人，一种新型的人，身体健康，心胸开阔，有崇高的理想，劳动创造的手，并且永远乐观。
    惠特曼式的人，肯定的说，是一种新的人，是一种足资我们学习、模仿的光辉榜样的人。
    在这里，周扬用“劳动创造的手”这样一个迷惑人的短句，好像惠特曼歌颂的是劳动人民。不，《草叶集》中所歌颂的“人”，并不是什么抽象的人，更不是劳动人民，而是美国资产阶级的化身。我们查了一下，发现一九四一年十一月周扬在延安《解放日报》上的一篇文章中，早就吹捧过美国资产阶级。那时他直截了当地说出了他所欣赏和赞美的惠特曼式的“人”，是“充满信心的美国资产阶级的典型，肉体地健壮，胸怀广阔”。丑死了，丑死了，把资产阶级个人主义的狭窄心肠捧做“胸怀广阔”，不觉得肉麻吗？在六亿工人农民兴起对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造高潮的时刻，在社会主义英雄人物成千上万地涌现的时刻，周扬再一次把反动虚伪的资产阶级“民主自由”捧做“崇高理想”，把惠特曼当作“参加斗争”的“范例”，把“美国资产阶级的典型”叫做“新型的人”，当作“光辉榜样”，把堂·吉诃德的骑士道德捧作“高度的道德原则”，要人民去“学习、模仿”，这不是公开同毛泽东思想对抗吗？这不是对于六亿工人农民的翻天覆地的社会主义革命一个猛烈的反扑吗？这不是要城乡资产阶级和党内的右倾机会主义者“永远乐观”，坚决抗拒社会主义改造，坚持走资本主义道路吗？
    这还不够。紧接着对西方资产阶级的吹捧，一九五六年三月，周扬就迫不及待地在《建设社会主义文学的任务》的报告中，破天荒地一次封了五位所谓“当代语言艺术的大师”。他用双手奉上“大师”的皇冠，表现了自己是资产阶级“权威”忠实的代理人。这也是从外国学来的。这是命令无产阶级向资产阶级“权威”跪倒投降，这是对于毛泽东同志历次指示的猖狂大反攻。这顶帽子封了许多人的嘴。当一九五八年、五九年，有一些要求革命的“小人物”冲破了周扬的禁令，甘冒挨打的危险，对其中某几位“大师”进行了一点批评时，周扬马上出来为这些“大师”保镖，多次用最刻毒的语言打击批评者。一九六二年二月，他在对“老剧作家”的讲话中愤恨地反驳道：“有人对有些作家被称为语言艺术大师不满意，说是捧场。……要不要学语言？要不要跟大师学？”这不是要青年死心塌地做资产阶级“大师”的奴仆吗？连对资产阶级表示一点“不满”都不准，真是蛮横极了。
    第四次大斗争，是一九五七年粉碎资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的伟大斗争。这次斗争，发生在我国经济战线上在所有制方面的社会主义改造基本完成之后。苏共“二十大”以后国际修正主义的大出笼大泛滥，直接促使了国内的修正主义逆流的发展。周扬在这个时期发表了一连串的讲话和文章，为资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻提供了精神武器。
    一九五六年三月，苏共“二十大”刚开过，周扬在文艺工作座谈会上就赤裸裸地说：
    一定要向资本主义国家学习。我们不只学习苏联，也要学习资本主义国家中那些进步的艺术。……比如《居里夫人》就是很好的片子，思想性或艺术性都是很高的，这是十几年以前的美国片子，虽然不是正面宣传共产主义，但是那就是共产主义的世界观，居里夫人的世界观和我们共产主义者的世界观是一致的。所以我们要与资本主义国家的进步文艺发生更密切的关系……我们应该吸收他们的好的东西，在这样的过程中，我们会影响他们，而他们也会影响我们。
    这是一篇搞“和平演变”的计划书。《居里夫人》是美国罗斯福执政时拍摄的一部反动影片。它通过居里夫人的一生，集中宣扬了资产阶级人道主义、和平主义、个人奋斗、成名成家、阶级调和的反动观点，宣传了科学家的活动是超阶级、超政治的，要为“全人类”服务，实际上是为垄断资产阶级榨取高额利润服务。美国垄断资产阶级拍出这种“传记片”，是想用比较隐蔽的形式，为资产阶级涂脂抹粉，“影响”和腐蚀美国劳动人民，使他们放弃阶级斗争的道路而幻想爬到资本主义社会的上层，用心极为恶毒。它比那些色情片、“西部片”有更大的欺骗作用。周扬把它当作宝贝，称颂它是“进步的艺术”，是要做美帝国主义想做而没有做到的事，即用西方资产阶级反动艺术来“影响我们”，使我们的艺术变成挂社会主义羊头，卖资本主义狗肉的修正主义艺术，为培养新的资产阶级分子服务。同志们只要看一看，这些年来，在周扬一伙控制下出了多少坏电影，这些坏电影同西方资产阶级艺术有多少“密切的关系”，就会懂得向美国这种“进步电影”学习的结果是什么了。
    周扬说，“居里夫人的世界观和我们共产主义者的世界观是一致的”。这是一大发明。你们同资产阶级的世界观讲“一致”，说明你们这伙“共产主义者”嘴上的“共产主义”是假共产主义，即修正主义。这难道不是暴露了你们的一个大秘密吗？请看自然科学领域中那些走资本主义道路的当权派，他们不是同周扬一样，到处同资产阶级反动世界观讲“一致”吗？
    不久，周扬在一九五六年九月二十六日《人民日报》，又发表了《让文学艺术在建设社会主义伟大事业中发挥巨大的作用》一文。这是一个反社会主义的资产阶级反动纲领，这是一篇反党反毛泽东思想的宣言书。
    周扬在文章中大反“庸俗化”“简单化”“清规戒律”“宣传作用”，认为党的“教条主义”、“宗派主义”、“对待文艺工作的简单化的、粗暴的态度”，“严重地束缚了作家、艺术家的创作自由。”自由是有阶级内容的。抽象的“创作自由”是资产阶级的反党口号。在阶级社会里，只有阶级的自由，没有超阶级的自由。有了无产阶级和劳动人民对资产阶级进行专政的自由，就没有资产阶级和一切反动派进行反革命活动的自由。有了资产阶级反党反社会主义的自由，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民进行社会主义革命和建设的自由。周扬向党伸手要“创作自由”，是为资产阶级争反党反社会主义自由，让牛鬼蛇神解除“束缚”，自由地搞反毛泽东思想反社会主义的反革命活动。周扬所攻击的所谓“教条主义”“清规戒律”，就是毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中阐明的关于无产阶级文艺的根本原则；他所攻击的“宣传作用”，就是反对文艺宣传无产阶级的即共产主义的世界观。“创作自由”和所谓“反教条主义”这两个反党口号，后来成为文艺界资产阶级右派猖狂进攻的主要武器。直到一九六二年、六三年，不是还有人用“尊重创作自由”之类的老谱，来为各种毒草催生吗？
    资产阶级向无产阶级进攻越凶，周扬反革命的真面目就暴露得越清楚。正当资产阶级右派向无产阶级猖狂进攻达到高潮的时候，一九五七年四月九日，周扬在《文汇报》上发表讲话，眉飞色舞地欢呼“剧目开放是戏曲界的一件大事”，为舞台上乱舞的群魔助威；极力赞美右派分子刘宾雁等从苏修那里搬来的所谓“干预生活”的一批大毒草，认为“尖锐地揭露和批评生活中的消极现象的作品，愈来愈引起了人们的注目”。在四月间，周扬召开了一系列的会议，呼风唤雨，煽风点火，反对所谓“春寒”，要求“春暖”，鼓动右派起来争取“春天”也就是资本主义复辟的到来。五月十三日，他在一次报告中疯狂地诬蔑共产党员“像特务一样”“像木头一样”，极力称赞当时成为章罗联盟喉舌的《文汇报》放火“胆子大”。他说，讲要杀几百万共产党的人，“也不见得就是反革命分子。”真是毒牙毕露。这完全证实他是一个漏网的大右派。
    反右派斗争一打响，玩弄反革命两面派手段的周扬，立刻又见风转舵，巧妙地摇身一变，把自己的大右派的狰狞面目藏起来。在整风开始的时候，周扬和旧中宣部负责人，十分热心地积极为丁玲、陈企霞反党集团翻案，要摘掉他们反党的帽子，直接把矛头指向以毛主席为首的党中央。可是反右派斗争一起，周扬却立刻利用对丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰的批判，把自己这个大右派打扮成左派，俨然用“一贯正确”的姿态出来总结文艺界反右派斗争。在《文艺战线上的一场大辩论》一文中，他把“我们这些人”分成“两种人”，一种人是“同党不是一条心”，“不肯按照集体主义的精神改造自己”的；另一种人就是他周扬，说是已经“丢掉个人主义的包袱”，“同党一条心了”。对照一下那些恶毒的右派言论吧，这种两面派的手段是多么卑鄙呵！前次，在反胡风反革命集团的斗争中，周扬用两面派的手段投了一次机；这次，在反丁玲、陈企霞、冯雪峰反党集团的斗争中，周扬又用两面派的手段投了一次机。他用这两次投机，把自己的罪恶掩藏了过去，包庇了一批右派、叛徒混过关，把他黑线中的一伙人安插到文艺界各种领导岗位上去，扩大他反党反社会主义的势力。这还不算，他又乘机翻案，篡改他在三十年代执行王明右倾机会主义、提出“国防文学”这个投降主义口号的一段历史，反诬鲁迅是“宗派主义”。翻手为云，覆手为雨，他耍了多少花招！
    有一些人总爱写什么三部曲。总起来看，周扬的一套把戏，原来玩的也是三部曲：向党向毛泽东思想猖狂进攻；然后马上用假检讨或者伪装积极一变而站在正确方面；然后大搞反攻倒算，发动新的进攻。周扬的所谓“一贯正确”史，就是一部反革命两面派史。然而，阶级斗争的规律是不以人们的意志为转移的。周扬混过了这四次大斗争，在第五次大斗争中，三部曲还没有演完，他的反革命修正主义面目就彻底暴露了，就被无产阶级文化大革命的利剑彻底戳穿了。
    大风大浪中的大暴露
    一九五八年社会主义建设总路线提出以来的历史，是我国社会主义革命更加深入发展的历史。在这个期间，以毛泽东同志为首的党中央马克思列宁主义的领导，同党内的反革命修正主义集团、资产阶级反动路线，进行了两次大斗争，即一九五九年的一次，最近的一次。在斗争中，我国社会主义事业取得了空前伟大的胜利。
    在这场阶级斗争的大风大浪中，旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委的领导人，包括周扬在内，进一步暴露了他们反革命修正主义面目。周扬自以为自己的势力更大了，政治资本更多了，加上有了旧北京市委的赫鲁晓夫式的野心家作后台，有了提出资产阶级反动路线的人物的支持，可以更加放肆了。在这种估计下，他就抛掉了伪装的一面，赤裸裸地摆出了他反革命的本来面目，更加恶毒、更加疯狂、更加嚣张地向党、向无产阶级专政、向毛泽东思想发动进攻。
    一九五九年一月，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团召开了苏共第二十一次代表大会。赫鲁晓夫在会上对我国总路线、人民公社、大跃进，进行了恶毒的诬蔑和攻击。在赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团的支持下，自命为海瑞的右倾机会主义反党集团，在庐山会议上，提出了一个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领，梦想推翻以毛泽东同志为首的党中央领导，把我国拉回资本主义的黑暗道路上去。在这个过程中，周扬猖狂地进行了大量的反革命活动，积极为右倾机会主义反党集团的政治需要服务。
    一九五九年二月，周扬在《牡丹》二月号上发表了一篇题为《在洛阳宣教干部座谈会上的谈话》，说什么经过了一九五八年的批判，“有一种被压抑的情绪”，现在要颠倒过来，“要使人人敢于讲话，敢于发表不同意见”。“人人”是划分为阶级的，周扬要动员起来的“人人”是什么阶级的人呢？就是一小撮资产阶级右派。无产阶级和资产阶级，社会主义和资本主义，不是你压倒我，就是我压倒你。不是无产阶级和广大革命人民被资产阶级“压抑”，就是资产阶级被无产阶级和广大革命人民“压抑”，有阶级对立存在，就根本没有什么“人人”平等、“人人”不受“压抑”的社会。无产阶级专政对广大革命人民实行最广泛的大民主，对一小撮地富反坏右分子就要进行坚决的专政。只有对敌人进行专政，才能保障人民的民主权利。周扬所谓要“人人敢于讲话”，就是要把那些被批判的牛鬼蛇神重新扶起来，只准他们“讲话”攻击毛泽东思想，攻击党的总路线，不准无产阶级“讲话”批判他们。“也要让少数人讲话，因为他代表某种社会力量”。这是混淆黑白。对所谓“多数”和“少数”，都必须作阶级分析。坚定的左派和顽固的右派都是少数。右派是极少数。左派争取、团结了中间派才成为多数。你周扬残酷地压迫无产阶级左派这个“少数”，却支持极“少数”资产阶级右派登台夺权，这分明是要他们来专革命人民的政。
    一九五九年初春，周扬为了贯彻他鼓动牛鬼蛇神“敢于讲话”的反动纲领，向周信芳推荐《海瑞上疏》的题材，并且提供了具体材料。他向周信芳说：现在“大家不敢讲话，演一演这类戏是需要的”。“少数人”到了两个反党分子私下对话的时候，变成了“大家”。这个“大家”就是他们所代表的极少数地富反坏右。他要通过《海瑞上疏》，为右倾机会主义者和一切牛鬼蛇神打气。一九五九年，他到处宣传“海瑞精神”，还广泛动员各地来京的艺术团体的干部和演员，要求他们“选择海瑞、包公”作为“今天写历史剧”的主角。吴晗不是说写反党的“海瑞戏”也要“全国一盘棋”吗？这“一盘棋”的指挥者就是周扬。
    一九五九年二月，周扬在创作工作座谈会上疯狂地攻击大跃进，奴颜婢膝地把现代修正主义的反动艺术叫做“国际水平”。他咒骂我们的党说：“有了一千万吨钢，就以为了不起了，连苏联也不放在眼里了。”伟大的七亿中国人民的“眼里”有五大洲的革命风云和全世界的阶级兄弟，就敢于蔑视世界上一切反动派，包括美帝国主义和现代修正主义在内，敢于同一切妖魔鬼怪进行针锋相对的斗争，鄙视它们，压倒它们，战胜它们。周扬“眼里”只有几个修正主义的狐群狗党，他当然要对着大无畏的中国人民狂吠了。他还攻击我们的党“违背国际主义”。这证明了他所谓的“国际主义”，就是把修正主义奉为“老子党”，跟在苏联现代修正主义屁股后面，亦步亦趋。这是同无产阶级国际主义完全对立的资产阶级的奴才主义。
    一九五九年六、七月间，周扬在中国人民解放军第二届文艺会演大会干部座谈会上作了讲话。这个报告，同右倾机会主义分子不久之后在庐山会议上提出的反革命路线唱的完全是一个调子。他诬蔑我们歌颂大跃进是“搽粉”，是“乱用群众的积极性”；他攻击群众运动，咒骂唱革命歌曲是“老太婆唱歌没有人听”；他咒骂劳动人民不配作诗，因为“做诗本来是要灵感的”；咒骂“中学生是些小娃娃，十二三岁”，根本没有资格过问政治，如果要他们学习政治，是“庸俗的了解为政治服务”。一谈到大跃进，一谈到群众运动，包括工农兵起来掌握文化的群众运动，他就冷嘲热讽，指手划脚，极尽其挖苦打击之能事，这是出于他的资产阶级憎恨社会主义、憎恨革命群众的阶级本性。这种站在群众运动对面的人，不管多高的职位，到头来总要碰得头破血流的。事实无情地驳斥了周扬，今天，不但从“老太婆”到青少年都齐声高唱革命歌曲，“十二三岁”的“中学生”和小学生，也正以空前高涨的“积极性”投入无产阶级文化大革命，向资产阶级发动一场全面的总进攻！
    周扬在这个报告中还极端狂妄地攻击说：“十年来”，有我们自己的“科学著作”没有？周扬妄想把解放以后十年中，毛泽东思想在各个方面的伟大发展，一笔抹杀，真是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”。周扬这个家伙，你低头听着：一九四九年到一九五九年，十年以来，党中央出版了光芒万丈的《毛泽东选集》，成为我国和全世界人民进行革命的指南针，这算不算“科学著作”？十年以来，在政治、军事、哲学、文化、经济、党的建设等各个方面，毛泽东同志写了《论人民民主专政》《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》《关于农业合作化问题》《论十大关系》……等等伟大的划时代的马克思列宁主义著作，进一步天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段，这算不算“科学著作”？十年以来，毛泽东同志亲自领导了思想战线上的历次伟大斗争，写了《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》《文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判》等等著名文章，包括本文第一部分提到的直接批判你周扬的那些重要指示，这算不算“科学著作”？你的反革命面目难道还不清楚吗？
    其实，拆穿了，你们所谓“科学著作”，就是现代修正主义那些又臭又长七拼八凑的“条条”、“本本”、“教科书”，就是那些“嘴尖皮厚腹中空”的牛皮，你们眼睛里只有洋菩萨的修正主义好，毛泽东思想这个战无不胜的无产阶级革命的科学，掌握了毛泽东思想的广大群众手中的活哲学、活科学，你们一概疯狂地反对。这充分暴露了旧中宣部一伙人反革命修正主义的罪恶本质。这种罪恶，要全党共讨之，全国共诛之！
    一九六一年到一九六二年，国内资本主义势力和封建势力向社会主义发动进攻达到了高潮。现代修正主义者联合美帝国主义和各国反动派，加紧对我国我党进行封锁、包围、诬蔑、渗透、颠覆。妖魔鬼怪纷纷出笼，修正主义逆流泛滥一时。周扬不但积极组织文艺界的牛鬼蛇神，为阴谋篡党、篡军、篡政的反革命修正主义集团作舆论准备；也是一个发了狂、红了眼、自己出来打头阵的主将。他连续召开许多专业会议，抛出了一个接一个的修正主义纲领；他还拔脚在全国乱跑，上海、长春、杭州、大连、福州、厦门……，到处开会，到处做报告，四面点火，八方煽风，鼓动和策划牛鬼蛇神起来夺权，起来翻案，反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想。文艺界的一批反革命的修正主义分子，几乎都是从周扬一伙那里拿到通行证，按周扬的信号弹行动的。一切接近灭亡的反动阶级，总是利令智昏地来个自我大暴露，以便革命人民看出他们的真相，群起而灭之。下面我们只举出几个突出的方面：
    周扬疯狂地反对和咒骂毛泽东思想。周扬一贯反毛泽东思想，但过去总要用反革命两面派的手法披上一件伪装。一九六一年以后，他以为形势对自己有利，资产阶级的复辟阴谋就要得逞了，索性抛掉伪装，赤膊上阵，跳了出来破口大骂。
    一九六一年二月，周扬跑到上海，在一次座谈会上，他攻击有的戏“把‘感谢毛主席’这句话直接表现出来，一遍还不够，感谢了三遍四遍”。感谢毛主席，感谢共产党，永远跟毛主席走，跟党走，这是几万万中国劳动人民从心里喊出来的，是每一个从剥削阶级压迫下得到解放的劳动人民永远不能忘记的头等大事，为什么你周扬这样深恶痛绝？这完全表现了周扬反革命的阶级本性。
    一九六一年三月，周扬跑到福建去大骂毛泽东思想。他说：“毛泽东思想是一条红线，太多了就不是红线，而是红布了。政治是灵魂，灵魂不是肉体……灵魂不占地方，来去无踪。”把毛泽东思想变成一根“来去无踪”、“不占地方”的线，这不是明明要把毛泽东思想赶出各个领域，让修正主义、资本主义思想去挂帅么？这一段十分刻毒的黑话，他到处讲，翻来覆去不知讲了多少遍。
    一九六一年六月，周扬在文艺工作座谈会上恐吓说：“广播电视里不要老宣传拥护毛主席”。这是旧中宣部的阎王殿里的黑话。这充分显示了他的反革命嘴脸。你们反对宣传“拥护毛主席”，你们要宣传“拥护”什么人呢？岂不是想把一小撮被全党全国人民唾弃的反党分子“拥”上台，实现反革命复辟么？你们这种打算，只能落得个可悲的下场。
    一九六二年七月，他又跑到东北去反对“天天讲毛主席”。我们就是要天天讲毛主席，天天读毛主席的书，天天温习毛主席的指示，天天学毛主席思想。“天天讲毛主席”，一切牛鬼蛇神就没有空子好钻了，一出来就被识破了，一活动就被抓住了。
    周扬是一个对毛泽东思想刻骨仇恨的反革命的修正主义分子。那些冠冕堂皇的话统统是骗人的。上面这些材料，还不足以说明这个人的真面目是多么反动么？
    周扬疯狂地为一切牛鬼蛇神翻案，向革命人民反攻倒算，鼓动和组织过去被打倒的形形色色反革命分子和资产阶级“权威”向党进攻。
    一九六一年三月十九日，“三家村”反革命集团的《燕山夜话》开张了。只隔一周，三月二十六日，《文艺报》立刻抛出了一篇题名为《题材问题》的专论。这篇文章是一个彻头彻尾的反革命的修正主义文艺纲领。它是在周扬、林默涵授意、指导之下写的，并经过他们精心修改。这篇文章提出了一个煽动性的口号，叫做“用一切办法广开文路”。
    他们要“广开”什么“文路”呢？
    没有什么抽象的“文路”。社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间，只能是你死我活的斗争。“开”社会主义文艺的“文路”，就要堵塞资本主义反动文艺的“文路”；“开”资本主义、封建主义反动文艺的“文路”，就要堵塞社会主义文艺的“文路”。他们说，“广开文路”是为了“不使任何有志之士、有用之才受到冷淡或压抑”，对了，这就暴露了他们原来是要“用一切办法”为那些在无产阶级专政下受到“冷淡或压抑”的反革命分子翻案，好让那些怀有反革命之“志”的牛鬼蛇神，利用报刊、文艺的工具，通行无阻、横冲直撞地进行反革命宣传。你看：反革命复辟可以走“武路”，也可以走“文路”，我们一定要“用一切办法”粉碎他们由“文路”实行复辟的梦想，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    请看周扬是怎样在各种“座谈会”上，接二连三地为那些被“压抑”的“有志之士”翻案，狂热地鼓动他们向党进攻：
    他狂热地歌颂资产阶级右派分子。他说：右派中“有些很有头脑的人”，十分“宝贵”，那些反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的青年人“很有学问”，要“注意培养他们”。他利用职权，千方百计把一批穷凶极恶、腐朽不堪的反革命分子和右派扶起来，当作“宝贝”，网罗进他控制下的各种机构中去，高官厚禄，关怀无微不至。连老汉奸、大流氓周作人，也批给他一个月几百元，帮他吮吸劳动人民的鲜血！相反，周扬、林默涵一伙对努力学习毛泽东思想的青年，对无产阶级左派，刻骨仇恨，咒骂他们是“头脑简单、情感简单、趣味简单”的人，因为他心目中“有头脑的人”，就是反毛泽东思想反社会主义的资产阶级右派！
    他极力附和胡风的反革命言论，为胡风翻案，完全暴露了他同胡风站在同一个立场。他说：“胡风说，机械论统治了中国文艺界二十年。……如果我们搞得不好，双百方针不贯彻，都是一些红衣大主教，修女，修士，思想僵化，言必称马列主义，言必称毛泽东思想，也是够叫人恼火的就是了。我一直记着胡风的这两句话”（一九六一年六月十六日）。这是多么毒辣的黑话！胡风是一个凶恶的反革命集团的头目，周扬却把胡风的话当成祖宗的“家训”一样“一直记着”，就因为他十分欣赏胡风对马克思列宁主义刻骨仇恨，对毛泽东思想刻骨仇恨。“言必称毛泽东思想”，是有所指的，毛泽东同志在《改造我们的学习》中批判那些坚持王明路线的人“言必称希腊”，其中包括了周扬，周扬一直怀恨在心，现在就破口骂出来了。你对“言必称毛泽东思想”感到“恼火”，因为你是个资产阶级，你是个洋买办，你要言必称洋人，言必称“别、车、杜”（即别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫），才觉得舒服。周扬还在一次吹捧胡风的“精神奴役的创伤”论，要作家根据胡风的反革命理论，去大写劳动人民的“落后、迷信、偏见、猜忌”等等，丑化和侮辱劳动人民。什么“批判”过胡风，统统是假的，是骗人的。还有什么“红衣主教”“修女修士”“思想僵化”，这种胡风式恶毒至极的语言真是叫人怒火直冒，念不下去！周扬用这种黑话来辱骂无产阶级左派，辱骂学习毛泽东思想的工农兵，只不过使人们看清了他这个修正主义者的黑心黑肺。其实，把“红衣主教”这顶帽子回敬给周扬，倒是很适合的，当时披着红袍子，打着黑旗子，抓着文化战线印把子的，不就是你们吗！？
    一九六一年六月，周扬又提出“我们要培养海瑞上本的精神”。这正是《海瑞罢官》演出之后，“三家村”的“兄弟”们“破门而出”“失败了再干”的进攻的时期。在周扬伙同文化部前党组书记齐燕铭的指挥下，《谢瑶环》《李慧娘》等大批毒草正在先后出笼。周扬一再鼓吹“海瑞精神”，是为了组织一场大进攻，把矛头指向党中央，为右倾机会主义分子翻案。一九六二年，旧中宣部主要领导人又一次提倡要学习魏征，他们一个“海瑞精神”，一个“魏征精神”，找到了反革命的共同语言。
    周扬还说：“首先要改变这种统治和被统治、改造和被改造的关系”，这就直截了当地说出了周扬的目的是要“改变”无产阶级专政，让“被统治”的反革命分子、胡风分子，海瑞，魏征，等等，变成“统治”者，一窝风上台专政，疯狂地镇压革命人民！
    周扬到处鼓吹资产阶级的“自由化”，要把各个协会、各个文艺团体、机关统统变成裴多菲俱乐部。周扬等人一九六一年七月抛出、八月一日又修改印发的《关于当前文学艺术工作的意见》（草案），即所谓“文艺十条”，其中心就是推翻毛泽东文艺路线，推翻以毛主席为首的党中央对文艺的领导，实现资产阶级自由化。
    “文艺十条”中攻击“在文艺如何为政治服务的问题上”存在着所谓“狭隘的、片面的、不正确的理解”，这就是周扬黑话原封不动的翻版。周扬所痛恨的“狭隘理解”，就是文艺紧密地为无产阶级的革命斗争服务，把文艺当作无产阶级革命的思想武器。周扬所谓的“广阔”，就是“十条”中一再叫嚣的“对于题材，不应作任何限制”，就是《文艺报》在《题材问题》专论中所说的“帮助人们认识世界的多样性，历史的规律性和生活的复杂性”。
    “不应作任何限制”是裴多菲俱乐部的反革命口号。任何事物都要受一定条件的限制，不受“任何限制”的事物是不存在的。问题在于是革命的限制还是反革命的限制，进步的限制还是反动的限制。无产阶级文艺要为无产阶级政治服务，就一定要接受无产阶级政治的限制，政治统帅文艺，自觉地从无产阶级的政治利益出发来考虑题材问题；不接受这种限制，就会接受资产阶级政治的限制，变成资产阶级文艺。“借古讽今”“崇洋非中”的毒草盛行一时，“离经叛道”“写中间人物”等等反社会主义的坏电影、坏戏、坏小说争相出笼，就是资产阶级反革命政治限制的结果。揭破在“限制”问题上的资产阶级唯心论的欺骗，是为了使人们看清周扬所谓“不应作任何限制”，其实是要求文艺不受六条政治标准的限制，不受为工农兵服务的限制，让帝王将相、才子佳人和各种大毒草统治文艺界，实行反革命的大复辟。
    他们所谓“世界的多样性”，其实只有一样，就是要美化和歌颂那些腐朽没落的地主阶级分子、资产阶级分子及其知识分子多种“多样”的丑态。在周扬看来，创造无产阶级英雄人物、歌颂无限壮丽的工农兵生活是“狭隘”的、“单调”的，只有大力地去描写资产阶级糜烂不堪的生活方式，才叫“多样”，才有什么“美的享受”。他们所谓“生活的复杂性”，其实也很简单，就是修正主义文艺中的红军战士同反革命白匪拥抱之类的阶级调和论和阶级投降主义，就是修正主义文艺中美化叛徒、奴才、阿飞、地富反坏右的肮脏手法，就是修正主义文艺中欣赏剥削阶级阴暗心理和精神分裂的丑恶笔墨！一九五九年，赫鲁晓夫无耻地吹捧肖洛霍夫时，就说什么《一个人的遭遇》的“伟大意义”是“表现了普通人的复杂的和丰富的精神世界”。赫鲁晓夫的应声虫们要我们去写什么“生活的复杂性”，不就是要我们去向肖洛霍夫之流的叛徒文学看齐吗？
    周扬大力推销现代修正主义的黑货，提出了“全民文艺”的修正主义口号。一九六一年十月开始的苏共“二十二大”，公开宣布了“全民国家”、“全民党”，赤裸裸暴露了自己用资产阶级专政代替无产阶级专政的叛徒面目。周扬急忙响应。他借一九六二年五月是《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年的机会，又玩弄了一个打着红旗反红旗的大阴谋。他把他手下的资产阶级“权威”，集中到北京，以“写文章”“总结经验”为名，发动了一个反毛泽东文艺路线的高潮。这伙人在周扬、林默涵的领导下，过着贵族老爷的生活，一天到晚密谋如何打击左派，如何反党反社会主义反毛主席，干了许多见不得人的肮脏勾当。最后抛出了《文艺队伍的团结、锻炼和提高》（《文艺报》社论）、《战斗的胜利的二十年》（何其芳）、《关于创造人物的几个问题》（陈荒煤）、《关于电影创新问题的独白》（瞿白音）……等一批反毛泽东思想的大毒草，对毛泽东文艺路线进行了全面的极其恶毒的歪曲和攻击。周扬亲自抓了一篇《人民日报》社论。三月十五日，周扬在一次会议上专门对“社论”内容作了详细的规定，定下了调子。后来又仔细修改。这篇发表时名为《为最广大的人民群众服务》的文章，中心就是用赫鲁晓夫的“全民文艺”来代替无产阶级文艺，用为“全体人民”服务来篡改为工农兵服务的毛泽东文艺方向。
    “全民文艺”是周扬一贯的修正主义思想。他多次提出过“全民的文学”“全民的文化”这类修正主义口号。到了苏共“二十二大”之后，他觉得有了洋主子作靠山，又有反革命修正主义集团头子的批准，就干脆把这个口号变成一篇反党反社会主义的纲领，用《人民日报》社论的形式，强加给全党。
    文章说：“人民民主统一战线内的以工农兵为主体的全体人民都应当是我们的文艺服务的对象和工作的对象。”这是对于毛泽东思想极其恶劣的篡改。毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中十分明确地指出：我们的文艺“首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的”。又指出：“工作对象问题，就是文艺作品给谁看的问题”，“文艺作品在根据地的接受者，是工农兵以及革命的干部”。为工农兵服务，以工农兵为对象，这是二十年来无产阶级文艺的根本方向，是阶级路线，是决定文艺阶级性质的根本条件。今天社会主义革命时期更是这样。周扬企图用所谓的“统一战线”来偷换文艺的工农兵方向，硬要把资产阶级作为我们文艺的服务对象，这是要篡改无产阶级文艺的阶级性质，使它变成资产阶级手里的反革命工具。周扬把资产阶级等革命的对象当成“工作的对象”，是要我们把对资产阶级的批判改变成对资产阶级的歌颂，用这条“全民文艺”的修正主义的路线反掉毛泽东的文艺路线，为资产阶级复辟“广开文路”！
    文章提出了一个口号，叫做“加强作家、艺术家同人民群众的联系”。这是一个原封不动从赫鲁晓夫那里搬来的修正主义口号。赫鲁晓夫做过一个报告，题目就叫做《文学艺术要同人民生活保持密切的联系》。苏共“二十二大”通过的搞假共产主义的所谓《苏联共产党纲领》中，就根据赫鲁晓夫的报告写上：“文学艺术发展的主要路线是加强同人民生活的联系。”为什么苏修这样欣赏和热衷于“联系人民生活”的口号呢？因为这个口号就是抛弃革命，就是抬高反革命。第一，它把作家、艺术家放到一个高高在上的贵族老爷的位置，只是要求他们“联系”一下“人民”，完全反对同工农兵结合；第二，赫鲁晓夫所谓“人民”，就是“全民”，就是那些资产阶级、高薪阶层。“密切联系人民”就是密切联系资产阶级、高薪阶层，为资产阶级服务；第三，它取消了文艺工作者的思想改造，使资产阶级作家可以完整地保存自己的资产阶级世界观，放手写反社会主义的反动作品；第四，裴多菲俱乐部也可以变成所谓“加强同人民联系”的一种形式，使反革命组织、反革命活动合法化。周扬把现代修正主义文艺当作“主要路线”的口号搬过来，是为了取消毛泽东同志关于文艺工作者“必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”的指示，使修正主义路线进一步统治中国的文艺界。
    够了。此人是一个报告狂，我们不可能列举这几年周扬多如牛毛的大小报告中所有反动内容，从这一部分事实中，已经足以看出周扬的真面目。平时以两面派面貌出现的周扬，在这场资产阶级向无产阶级进攻的大风大浪中，完全暴露了反革命一面派的本质。然而，“物极必反”，反革命派趾高气扬的充分暴露，反过来为革命派的反击提供了致命的子弹，周扬一伙就这样自己为自己准备了垮台的条件。
    摧毁黑线的顽强抵抗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    直到一九六二年九月党的八届十中全会前夕，周扬还在积极参加反对毛主席和党中央的阴谋活动。他伙同一小撮反党野心家，积极支持并鼓励为反党分子高岗翻案的反党小说《刘志丹》的出版。他亲自接见写这本书的反党分子，亲自审阅了这部小说，称赞这本书“做了一个模范”“树立了一个榜样”。他们企图假借这部小说，洗刷高岗的反党罪恶，篡改党史，推翻以毛主席为首的党中央对于高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的正确结论。
    他们的反党阴谋很快被党中央和毛主席识破了。在有伟大历史意义的党的八届十中全会上，毛泽东同志再一次强调了关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，并且直接批评了周扬等人。
    毛泽东同志指出：利用小说进行反党活动，是一大发明。凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。
    毛主席和党中央对周扬等人，又一次进行了严肃的批评和耐心的等待。但是周扬却又一次采用反革命的两面派手段，抗拒毛泽东同志的指示。十中全会之后，他利用职权，依靠混进党里、政府里、军队里窃踞重要职务的反党野心家的支持，压制左派的反击，力图再一次使用两面派的伎俩，把反党反社会主义黑线的力量保存下来，继续同无产阶级较量。于是，在广阔的思想阵地上，接连展开了一场场你死我活的争夺战：
    一、党的八届十中全会刚开过，周扬为了掩盖自己的反党罪行，急匆匆在一九六二年十月十九日向参加文艺工作座谈会的人作了一次所谓
  “传达”。一面把自己打扮成是“不能说精神准备很充分”的左派；一面歪曲十中全会精神，说什么文艺界“基本情况是好的”，“反党、反马克思主义的东西发表得……不多”，力图把许多大毒草都说成是香花，麻痹革命人民。又说什么“也不要走向另一极端”。就是说不要批判资产阶级，不要铲除毒草。无产阶级刚要开始反攻，他就决心抵抗到底了。
    二、紧接着，一九六二年十一月，在周扬的批准、指示和亲自策划下，在山东召开了所谓“孔子讨论会”。这是周扬伙同一大批牛鬼蛇神对十中全会革命精神的一次反攻。这是一个资产阶级右派嚣张得发了狂的黑会，演出了解放以来所未曾出现过的向封建祖宗鞠躬致敬的丑剧。
    三、一九六三年元旦，柯庆施同志根据党的八届十中全会的精神和毛泽东同志的指示，向上海文艺工作者提出了“写十三年”的倡议，希望文艺创作大力反映十三年来社会主义革命和建设的现实，歌颂工农兵中的英雄人物。这个革命的倡议马上受到了以周扬为首的文艺界修正主义集团的抵制和攻击。一九六三年四月，在中宣部召开的文艺工作会议上，周扬组织林默涵、邵荃麟等一伙人，从小组会到大会，围攻“写十三年”的口号。在这次会上，和接着在四月二十七日的全国文联委员扩大会上，周扬还亲自出马，大讲“不论写什么题材都能反映时代精神”，“不要以为只有描写现在，才是主导的”。到了一九六五年底，当他向青年业余作者作报告的时候，他却板起面孔批评什么“三年前”提出“写十三年”的时候，“有的同志就曾经表示不能接受”。好像他当时还是个积极分子。这真是虚伪透顶了！怎么能够这样子厚颜无耻，用撒谎来吹嘘自己呢？
    四、一九六三年上半年，毛泽东同志对“鬼戏”、“帝王将相、才子佳人”等提出了尖锐的批评，严厉指出周扬、齐燕铭、夏衍、林默涵领导的文化部是“帝王将相、才子佳人部”。周扬在一九六三年八月和十月的两次关于戏曲工作的讲话中，却说什么“主张演鬼戏不一定是资产阶级思想”，竭力对抗毛主席的批评。周扬还根据他投靠的反党野心家的谬论，公开提出所谓“分工论”，说什么“特别是京剧，适合于表现帝王将相”，制造反对革命现代戏的理论根据。他还吹嘘什么戏曲改革已经取得“巨大的成绩”，妄想把帝王将相、才子佳人统治舞台的罪恶掩盖起来。
    五、一九六三年九月，周扬专门召开了一次包括科学院哲学社会科学部各所和各报刊负责人的会议，带头围攻戚本禹同志《评李秀成自述》这篇革命文章。他在会议上喊叫“李秀成是一个民族英雄，把他说成叛徒是完全错误的。”指挥邓拓、翦伯赞之流出来“反驳戚本禹”。这个阴谋被毛主席及时发觉和制止了。
    六、一九六三年十月，周扬在哲学社会科学部扩大会议上做了报告。这个报告的第三部分是讲国内任务的，根本不谈当时思想战线上严重的战斗任务，相反，却大谈“整理和研究历史遗产”。他拿出了旧中宣部一伙人的黑话，拚命攻击所谓“用简单化的办法乱贴标签”。“标签”就是指阶级分析。他在会上排斥左派，捧出了一大批修正主义者、资产阶级“权威”来控制这次会议，在历史组做“反修报告”的就有邓拓。要邓拓来充当“反对修正主义”的领导，这不是开玩笑吗？不，这是做政治交易。周扬要投靠反革命的野心家，就一定要支持他们手下的“三家村”。
    七、一九六三年十二月，针对反党黑线对文艺界的反动统治，毛泽东同志再一次尖锐地指出：各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是“死人”统治着。毛泽东同志还说：许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。这个指示，同上面周扬吹捧戏曲
  “巨大成绩”的谎话，针锋相对，当头一棒，完全揭穿了周扬的反动立场。周扬却继续狡辩，妄想蒙混过关。一九六四年一月，周扬就在一次会议上公开反对毛主席的指示，他说：“文化部的错误不一定是路线错误。”“大多数人是认识问题，包括文艺部门的领导成员和我自己在内。”他以为这样一“包括”，他们就可以重演检讨几句、变为正确的那套反革命两面派把戏了。
    八、由于周扬等人一再抗拒中央指示，一九六四年六月，毛泽东同志又一次向文艺界的修正主义领导人提出了极其尖锐的批评，向周扬等人提出了严厉的警告。这就是本文开始时提到的被周扬篡改的那次指示。周扬见势不妙，再抗拒下去自己有灭顶的危险，于是在文化部搞了一次所谓“整风”。这是一次欺骗群众、压制左派、包庇坏人、掩护自己的假“整风”。一九六四年十一月，周扬在一次“报告”中就利用“批评”夏衍等的机会，吹嘘他从延安文艺座谈会以来，就是“在主席教导下工作的”。“我的错误和你们的路线错误不同”，是“没有经验”。对他周扬是不准批判了，对别人的批判也要“有领导”，即“一律要经过”他们反革命修正主义“领导”的“批准”。这是《阿Q正传》中假洋鬼子的手段：不准革命。
    九、在毛主席的亲自关怀下，一九六四年七月，举行了全国京剧现代戏观摩演出大会。一贯反对京剧革命现代戏的周扬和他的后台老板，突然假装热心起来。周扬又扮演了作“总结发言”的角色。这篇修改了多少遍的讲话，虽然想尽量装得革命些，却仍然露了马脚，他把夏衍向香港报纸记者发表歪曲京剧革命的谈话，说成是“对京剧演现代戏估计不足”；他还公开宣称：“不是说《谢瑶环》整个的都反动”，尽量开脱田汉的反革命罪行。
    十、一九六五年初，在毛主席的号召之下，对于杨献珍、周谷城的反动观点和一批坏电影的批判正在展开。周扬深知这些批判深入开展下去会危及自己的反革命统治，千方百计加以扑灭。他用的还是反革命两面派的老办法：一面假装赞成批判；一面窥测时机，一有机会，就一下子把运动拉向右转。二月下旬，正当一个批判高潮起来，周扬、林默涵立刻以“总结”为名，在北京召集几个主要报刊的负责人谈话，气势汹汹地指责这个时期发表的批判各种毒草的文章“打空炮”、“缺乏分析”、“教条主义”、“乱猜”、“夸大”、“光扣帽子”，进行了疯狂的反扑。他们还攻击和嘲笑工农兵群众的评论文章“简单化”，“不能代替专家评论”，想把工农兵的批评打下去。他们公开说：“批判夏衍、田汉等人，过去与现在要分开，政治与学术要分开。”又说什么“有些人家已经不谈了，……就算了”。一个“分开”，一个“算了”，这是对毛泽东同志发动的文化革命的反噬，是要强使对资产阶级的批判就此刹车。此计果然奏效，大批批判资产阶级的文章就此被死死扣押在他们的阎王殿里。
    十一、一九六五年九月，周扬等人以为他们已经把革命群众压了下去，稳住了阵脚，可以演三部曲的第三部曲了，马上迫不及待地向党进行反攻倒算。他们在北京召开了一个全国文化局（厅）长会议，周扬和他的后台老板，一齐登台，疯狂诬蔑毛泽东同志。他们还把夏衍、阳翰笙等人请上主席台去，趾高气扬地坐在那里继续专无产阶级的政，周扬在作报告时一再安慰他们：“不要老是想到我挨了批评，批评得多一点，少一点……批评得过重或是不够，总是有的”。向他们暗示批评得太“多”太“重”是可以翻案的，只要我周扬不倒，你们总是不会垮的，以后可以东山再起。并再一次把自己说成只是“觉察很迟，纠正很慢”，是“认识问题”。以为这样就可以把他们这一伙人全部保护过关，继续对无产阶级专政了。
    十二、最后，就是一九六五年十一月二十九日，周扬在全国青年业余文学创作积极分子大会上做的这一个报告。这是对《海瑞罢官》的批判开展十九天之后，无产阶级左派同资产阶级右派进行你死我活斗争的严重时刻。旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，为了坚决抗拒毛泽东同志关于批判资产阶级代表人物的指示，进行了一系列反党反社会主义的阴谋活动，疯狂地打击左派，包庇右派，妄想扑灭迫在眉睫的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火。在这个重要的时刻，周扬决心寸步不让，抗拒毛泽东同志彻底革命的指示。在他的报告中，只字不提眼前这场风雷激荡的斗争，就当作世界上根本没有批判《海瑞罢官》这回事。一九六六年一月，周扬的报告正式发表了。这时，距离他作报告的日子已经一个多月过去了；在这段时间里，革命人民批判《海瑞罢官》的斗争已经进一步展开，一小撮反革命的修正主义者则在作最后的顽抗。周扬在他公开发表的报告里，公然继续篡改毛泽东同志的指示，表示他决心抗拒到底。
    同志们请看：他们是多么顽固地抵抗党中央和毛泽东同志的指示啊！他们对无产阶级左派是抱着多么刻骨的仇恨啊！革命的火焰要烧到他们的头上了，他们就死也不肯后退了！他们就要动员黑线、黑店的所有力量反扑过来了！
    当我们回顾解放以来文艺斗争的历史时，可以清楚地看到两条路线的尖锐斗争：一条毛泽东文艺路线，是红线，是毛泽东同志亲自领导了历次重大的斗争，把文化革命一步步推向前进，作了长时间的准备，直到发动了轰轰烈烈的、向资产阶级全面进攻的、亿万人民参加的无产阶级文化大革命，一直挖进周扬一伙的老巢。一条反党反社会主义的资产阶级文艺路线，是黑线。它的总头目，就是周扬。周扬背后是最近被粉碎的那个阴谋篡党、篡军、篡政的反革命集团。胡风，冯雪峰，丁玲，艾青，秦兆阳，林默涵，田汉，夏衍，阳翰笙，齐燕铭，陈荒煤，邵荃麟等等，都是这条黑线之内的人物。他们内部不同集团之间尽管会发生各种争吵和排斥，但在有一点上是一致的：就是他们反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，反对工农兵群众、反党反社会主义的资产阶级反动政治立场。“批判”胡风的周扬又采用了胡风的恶毒语言，是他们本来就立场一致的缘故。周扬一伙用一打一拉、封官许愿、招降纳叛、相互吹捧等等卑劣手段，把一批叛徒，反革命分子，右派分子，极端个人主义者，都收罗进来，安插到各种岗位上去，当作反党反社会主义的工具。他们还竭力用种种方法，使青年中毒，变成资产阶级的接班人，罪恶地把一批青年作者拖入反党反社会主义的黑店。这条黑线控制了文化界，控制了各个协会，又伸展到各地，用所谓“会员”制度和重重迭迭的“协会”组织，养了一批资产阶级作家，排斥打击工农兵，搞了大大小小一批“裴多菲俱乐部”。这条黑线是为资本主义复辟服务的。今天，我们一定要砸烂他们一切“裴多菲俱乐部”，捣毁他们修正主义的阎王殿！我们一定要把所有文艺单位的领导权从资产阶级手中夺过来，彻底夺过来！要把那些腐朽的资本主义关系和封建关系，坚决地加以摧毁！
    周扬不是曾经自封为什么“马克思主义理论家”吗？由于周扬窃踞了党在文化方面的领导岗位，并利用党阀兼学阀的地位，把自己装成党在文艺方面的代表，不断吹嘘自己，吓唬别人，造成了这种假象。事物是作为过程而展开的，透过现象认识事物的本质，常常需要一个观察的过程，需要一段让隐藏着的本质充分暴露出来的时间。这并不奇怪。这种情况，过去有，今后还可能发生。然而，当那些反毛泽东思想的“大人物”的真面目暴露之后，回过头一看他们的历史，便会从庞大的假象中发现渺小的本质。周扬公开的文章和内部讲话，只要仔细一查，充满反动的谬论，错误百出，一戳就破。至于周扬自己的所谓“文艺理论”，不过是鸡零狗碎地从洋书中抄一些句子罢了。有什么了不起呢？
    周扬不是吹嘘他是从“解放区”来的吗？其实，在延安的时候，他同王实味、丁玲、萧军、艾青等托派分子、叛徒、反党分子是一路货色。周扬是一个混进革命队伍的资产阶级分子。三十年代，周扬是王明路线的执行者，是以鲁迅为代表的无产阶级文艺路线的反对者。四十年代初在延安，他仍旧顽强地宣告“在美学上，我是车尔尼雪夫斯基的忠实信奉者”（《解放日报》一九四一年七月十七日）。他到了革命根据地，却极端厌恶革命根据地。一九四一年七月十七日至十九日，他在《解放日报》上发表过反党杂文《文学与生活漫谈》，诬蔑和攻击“延安也自有它一个圈子，它的一套。都穿同样的制服，拿相差不多的津贴，……你在路上走，会从前后左右到处听得见挂在人们嘴上的老一套的革命术语。多么的千篇一律，丝毫没有变化啊！”他用资产阶级“反对派”的反革命语言，攻击延安“太窄狭”，“太呆板”，“容不下自己”，狂妄之极地要求“延安也决不能满足于自己已有的一套，而必须力求改进，使自己成为更广阔，更包罗万有”（《解放日报》一九四一年七月十九日）。这是在毛主席所在的地方，在全中国人民心中的革命圣地延安写出来的话啊！这样恶毒，同王实味的腔调有什么两样！一到无产阶级掌权的地方，周扬的资产阶级本性就爆发成仇恨的反党叫嚣了！“包罗万有”，就是要把牛鬼蛇神也“包罗”进来！果然，在周扬这三篇反党杂文带头之下，冒出了“包罗”王实味的《野百合花》、丁玲的《三八节有感》、艾青的《了解作家，尊重作家》在内的一批反革命的奇文。周扬这种反动立场和思想，受到了毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的尖锐批评。但是，他始终抗拒毛泽东同志的批评，死也不肯同工农兵结合。这种资产阶级反动本质屡教不改，到了社会主义革命时期，就进一步发展为全面的修正主义路线。
    周扬是一个反革命两面派。他之所以能长期蒙蔽一些人，同他这种两面派的手段有很大关系。要学会识别两面派型的人物。两面派是混入无产阶级内部的阶级敌人向我们进行斗争的一种策略，在强大的无产阶级专政条件下，他们只有用打着红旗反红旗的办法，才能够混下去。阴一面，阳一面，当面一套，背后一套，用的是马克思主义词句，贩的是修正主义黑货，在不利时退却，在有利时进攻，用假检讨来躲藏，用真进攻来反扑，招降纳叛，结党营私，以推翻无产阶级专政、实行资本主义复辟为自己的最终目的，这就是他们的一整套策略。识别这种两面派，要看他在重大关键时刻的政治立场，特别是资产阶级向无产阶级猖狂进攻时的政治立场，不能相信那些顺风转向的表面文章。揭露这种两面派，要靠群众运动。这次无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，不就烧掉了周扬的伪装，暴露出他丑恶的灵魂了吗？
    揭发出周扬这条黑线，文艺界就万事大吉了吗？也不是。揭发出来，并不等于挖掉，更不等于肃清影响；挖掉了这条黑线，还会有今后的黑线，还得再斗争。阶级斗争，政治斗争，总是要以这种或那种形式反映到文艺上来的。战斗的路还很长。真正的无产阶级革命派，要随着形势的发展不断向自己提出新的更高的斗争任务，决不能因为一个战役的胜利就麻痹起来，陶醉起来。
    正如毛泽东同志所说：无产阶级文化大革命是触及人们灵魂的大革命。它触动到人们根本的政治立场，触动到人们世界观的最深处，触动到每个人走过的道路和将要走的道路，触动到整个中国革命的历史。这是人类从未经历过的最伟大的革命变革，它将锻炼出整整一代坚强的共产主义者。当前是一片大好形势，但斗争的道路是曲折的。会有反复，会有起伏，会出现种种假象，会遇到反动势力的反扑和软化，要准备再打若干个回合；但胜利必将属于掌握了毛泽东思想的、善于学习的、团结群众的、革命到底的无产阶级革命左派。“实践、认识、再实践、再认识”，只要按照毛主席的这个教导认真去做，善于总结经验，使我们的认识跟着客观过程的发展而不断发展，我们就能练出一身敢于革命、善于革命的真本事。被这场文化大革命的滚滚洪流冲洗掉的，是一小撮旧世界的残渣余孽，是剥削阶级遗留下的各种腐朽制度和精神枷锁。中国人民将空前巩固地团结在伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导之下，高高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，迈着革命的大步，朝气勃勃地去创造一个红通通的共产主义的新世界。
    ①《清宫秘史》是一部彻头彻尾的卖国主义的影片。一九五○年三月开始在北京放映。它一面无耻地宣扬屈膝投靠外国帝国主义的奴才思想，美化光绪皇帝和地主阶级中的保皇党，疯狂地叫嚣要依靠“洋人”打进来“帮助皇上恢复皇位，重振朝纲”；一面狂热地诬蔑英勇地反对帝国主义的义和团是“杀人放火”“状如疯魔”的“拳匪”，极尽其丑化之能事。这个影片同美帝国主义一个腔调，完全适合了美帝国主义侵略中国的需要，完全适合了美帝国主义的走狗进行反革命复辟的需要，而同毛泽东同志《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》的伟大号召相对抗。可是这部卖国主义电影出来后，由于党内一小撮资产阶级代表人物的鼓吹，不但没有被批判，反而被捧成是“爱国主义”影片。那些反毛泽东思想的执行资产阶级反动路线的人，竭力阻挠对这个影片的批判。他们实际上“爱”的是地主资产阶级，他们用以观察问题的是地主资产阶级的唯心主义历史观，他们是真正的“保皇党”，这不是很清楚的吗？鼓吹《清宫秘史》的“大人物”当中，就包括有在当前这场无产阶级文化大革命中提出资产阶级反动路线的人，他们反毛泽东思想的反动资产阶级世界观，他们保护剥削阶级、仇恨革命的群众运动的本质，早在建国初期吹捧《清宫秘史》时就表现出来了。
