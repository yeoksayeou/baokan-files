	Smoke billows, and flames rage. The proletarian revolutionary factions, united by their deep hatred for the enemy, raise the red flag high and charge forward, engaging in a decisive battle with the capitalist-roaders in power. The mountains tremble, and the seas churn. The battle cry echoes through the sky: Unite, revolutionary factions of the proletariat! Stand together! Seize power from the hands of the capitalist-roaders in power! The fundamental issue of revolution is seizing power and holding onto power. With power, we have everything; without power, we have nothing. The revolutionary rebels are determined to seize the seal of office! The revolutionary rebels are determined to seize power! We, the People's Liberation Army, are the revolutionary army of the proletariat. We are the good sons of the working people! Our hearts beat as one with the revolutionary rebels, and our flesh and blood are intertwined. We firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels! We will shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: The great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions is excellent! The struggle to seize power from the bourgeoisie is excellent! We firmly support the revolutionary factions in seizing power. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and defend to the death the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! If the enemy dares to cause trouble, we will smash them to pieces.

　　解放军站在革命造反派一边
　　解放军某部一群战士硝烟滚滚，烈火漫漫，无产阶级革命派，凝聚起对敌人的深仇大恨，高举红旗，奋勇向前，正和走资本主义道路的当权派进行决战。高山震动，大海狂翻，战斗的吼声震天：无产阶级的革命派，联合起来！团结起来！从走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权！革命的根本问题是夺取政权和掌握政权。有了政权，就有了一切，没了政权，就没了一切。革命造反派就是要夺印！革命造反派就是要掌权！我们人民解放军是无产阶级革命军队，我们人民解放军是劳动人民好儿男！我们和革命造反派心心相印，我们和革命造反派血肉相连。我们坚决站在革命造反派这一边！我们要一千遍、一万遍地高呼：无产阶级革命派大联合好得很！对资产阶级的夺权斗争好得很！我们坚决做革命派的后盾，我们坚决支持革命派夺权。我们一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓死保卫无产阶级文化大革命！敌人胆敢捣乱，就坚决把他砸烂。
