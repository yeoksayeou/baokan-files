Chairman Mao has paved the way for the Long March.
The heroes of the Mao Zedong era are numerous, with drums and gongs echoing through the mountains and rivers. The motherland presents a new face, and seven hundred million people sing songs of praise. The revolutionary ranks stand in rows, heads held high with a magnificent demeanor. Chairman Mao has paved the way for the Long March, trampling over countless difficulties underfoot. The power of Mao Zedong Thought is mighty, and Chairman Mao's quotations shine with golden light. Transforming the heavens and the earth to create a new world, all demons and monsters are swept away. Chairman Mao trusts the workers, peasants, and soldiers the most; we are the main force of the revolution. The red flag flutters, guiding the way, as Chairman Mao leads us to victory. Seize the revolution and promote production; Chairman Mao's call is etched in our hearts. Pick up the pen and hold the hoe tightly, forever being propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's path is clear, and we carry the revolutionary banner. The future of the motherland is bright, and the people's country will last for ten thousand years.

    社员　殷光兰毛泽东时代英雄多，锣鼓喧天震山河。祖国一片新面貌，七亿人民唱赞歌。革命队伍一排排，昂首挺胸好气派。毛主席铺出长征路，万重困难脚下踩。毛泽东思想威力强，毛主席语录闪金光。改天换地创世界，牛鬼蛇神全扫光。毛主席最信任工农兵，革命主力军我们担当。红旗飘飘把路引，毛主席带领我们打胜仗。抓革命，促生产，毛主席号召记心间。拿起笔杆握紧锄，永做毛泽东思想宣传员。毛主席铺路方向明，革命大旗我们扛。祖国前程多美好，人民江山万年长。
