The Vietnam Committee for the Investigation of U.S. War Crimes in Vietnam held a press conference for domestic and foreign journalists on January 21, strongly condemning the heinous crimes of U.S. aggressor aircraft continuously and madly bombing the two industrial zones of Vinh Phuc and Thanh Hoa in North Vietnam.

The vice-chairman of the committee, Phan Van Bang, read out a statement at the meeting. The statement said that from January 15 to 18 this year, U.S. aggressor aircraft continuously attacked the industrial centers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam—Vinh Phuc and Thanh Hoa. In the attacks, U.S. imperialism indiscriminately bombed residential areas, villages, government buildings, enterprises, and hospitals, killing and injuring more than 130 civilians, many of whom were women and children, and destroying hundreds of civilian homes.

The statement said that while the U.S. aggressors were escalating the war against North Vietnam, they were also committing extremely brutal crimes in South Vietnam: they used bombs and bulldozers to destroy and level the entire village of Ben Tre, driving its 8,000 residents into concentration camps; in addition, they deployed B-52 bombers to drop hundreds of tons of incendiary bombs in the province of Tuyen Duc, burning down forests over dozens of square kilometers.

The statement said that U.S. imperialism's madness and brutality on Vietnamese soil have reached new heights. In order to salvage its heavy military and political defeats in both North and South Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is sliding down the path of its heinous aggressive war. The statement pointed out that the U.S. aggressors' heinous crimes further exposed the extremely reactionary and aggressive nature of the U.S. war criminals, and at the same time, exposed the hypocritical essence of the U.S. government's "peace" and "negotiation" tricks.

The statement concluded by pointing out that in the face of the U.S. aggressors' vicious and brutal actions, the Vietnamese people not only did not waver but deepened their hatred for the enemy, thereby becoming more united and resolute in their fight for the independence and freedom of their country, for peace in Southeast Asia and the world, and determined to defeat the U.S. aggressors.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on January 21, the Ministry of Water Resources of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 20, strongly condemning the heinous crime of U.S. aggressor aircraft bombing the water conservancy project in Thua Thien Province, North Vietnam, on January 16.

The statement pointed out that this was a very brutal war action by the U.S. aggressors aimed at attacking densely populated areas and extensive agricultural production areas in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    新华社河内二十三日电　越南民主共和国调查美帝国主义在越南的战争罪行委员会二十一日举行国内外记者招待会，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机连续疯狂轰炸越南北方两个工业区——越池和太原的滔天罪行。
    这个委员会的副主席范文白在会上宣读了一项声明。声明说，从今年一月十五日到十八日，美国强盗飞机接连袭击越南民主共和国的工业中心——越池和太原，美帝国主义在袭击中，滥肆轰炸各个居民区、村庄、机关、企业和医院，炸死、炸伤居民一百三十多人，其中有许多妇女和儿童，炸毁民房成百幢。
    声明说，美国侵略者在对越南北方进行战争“升级”的同时，还在越南南方不断犯下极其野蛮的罪行：它们用炸弹和推土机摧毁和夷平了整个边蓄镇，把这个镇的八千个居民赶进集中营；此外，他们还出动B—52型飞机在土龙木省投下成百吨燃烧弹，烧毁方圆几十平方公里的树林。
    声明说，美帝国主义在越南国土上的疯狂和残暴达到了新的高峰。美帝国主义为了挽救它在越南南北两方在军事上和政治上的惨重失败，正在沿着罪恶滔天的侵略战争道路滑下去。声明指出，美国侵略者的滔天罪行，进一步暴露了美国战争罪犯的极其反动的侵略面目，同时也暴露了美国政府玩弄“和平”和“谈判”花招的虚伪本质。
    声明最后指出，在美国强盗的凶恶和残暴的行动面前，越南人民不但丝毫没有动摇，相反地进一步加深了对敌人的仇恨，从而更加团结一致地为祖国的独立和自由，为东南亚和世界的和平而坚决地战斗，并决心战胜美国侵略强盗。
    据新华社河内二十一日电　据这里报纸报道：越南民主共和国水利部发言人二十日发表声明，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机十六日轰炸越南北方太平省茶灵水利工程的滔天罪行。
    声明指出，这是美国侵略者旨在袭击越南民主共和国居民稠密区和农业生产广大地区的一种极其野蛮的战争行动。
