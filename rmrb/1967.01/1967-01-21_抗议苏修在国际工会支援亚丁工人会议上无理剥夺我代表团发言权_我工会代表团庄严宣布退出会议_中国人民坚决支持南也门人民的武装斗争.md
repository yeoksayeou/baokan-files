The delegation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions attending the Third Session of the International Trade Union Committee in Support of Aden Workers and People, held in Damascus, withdrew from the meeting on the morning of January 18 after the Soviet Union and the World Federation of Trade Unions manipulated the meeting and unreasonably deprived the Chinese delegation of its right to speak.

Before withdrawing from the meeting, the Chinese delegation issued a statement. The statement said: The Chinese trade union delegation came to participate in the meeting at the invitation of the Syrian General Federation of Trade Unions. In order to express our support for the struggle of the people of Aden and the world against imperialism and colonialism, and for the struggle to maintain national independence, we requested to speak according to the meeting's procedures and submitted our speech draft.

The statement said: "To our surprise, our speech draft was subjected to examination, and we were asked to revise it, to speak according to someone else's will. The Chinese trade union delegation, of course, cannot agree to this undemocratic and unfair practice that violates the customary practices of international conferences. However, because we insisted on our principled stance, we were deprived of our right to speak."

The statement said: "It is obvious that this was a joint plot and manipulation by Soviet revisionists and the World Federation of Trade Unions behind the scenes."

The statement continued: Our speech was intended to express the firm support of the Chinese workers for the workers and people of South Yemen, especially their armed struggle, to express our firm support for the anti-imperialist struggle of Syria, Palestine, and other Arab and Asian, African, and Latin American countries; we wanted to condemn and expose the number one enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism, and its chief accomplice, the Soviet revisionist leadership; we wanted to expose the United Nations as a tool for American imperialist aggression. Our views on these issues reflect the common demands and wishes of the people and workers of the Arab world and Asian, African, and Latin American countries. The statement said: "The Chinese trade union delegation solemnly declares that because our right to speak has been illegally deprived, we have no choice but to withdraw from this meeting.

"The Soviet revisionist leadership and the World Federation of Trade Unions must bear full responsibility for all the consequences that arise from this."

The statement concluded: "Their despicable methods do not harm a single hair of the Chinese working class. We, the Chinese working class, will continue to unswervingly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strongly support the revolutionary struggles of the workers and people of all countries."

On January 18, the delegation of the General Federation of Trade Unions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the delegation of the General Federation of Trade Unions of the Liberation Zone of South Vietnam issued a statement at the Third Session of the International Trade Union Committee in Support of Aden Workers and People. They expressed regret over the unreasonable deprivation of the right to speak by the Chinese and Albanian trade union delegations and the forced withdrawal of these delegations from the meeting by the presidium of the conference.

　　抗议苏修在国际工会支援亚丁工人会议上无理剥夺我代表团发言权
　　我工会代表团庄严宣布退出会议
　　中国人民坚决支持南也门人民的武装斗争
    据新华社大马士革十八日电　出席在这里举行的国际工会支援亚丁工人和人民委员会第三次会议的中华全国总工会代表团，由于苏联和世界工会联合会操纵这次会议，无理剥夺了中国代表团的发言权，在十八日上午退出了会议。
    中国代表团在退出会议之前发表了声明。声明说：中国工会代表团是应叙利亚工会总联合会的邀请来参加会议的。为了表示我们支持亚丁和世界人民反对帝国主义和殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，我们按照会议的程序，要求发言，并提交了我们的发言稿。
    声明说：“使我们感到惊讶的是，我们的发言稿受到了审查，并要我们修改发言稿，要按照别人的意愿讲话。中国工会代表团当然不能同意这种违反国际会议惯例的不民主、不公平的做法。然而，由于我们坚持我们的原则立场，我们竟被剥夺了发言权。”
    声明说：“很明显，这是由苏联修正主义者和世界工会联合会在幕后合伙精心策划和操纵的。”
    声明接着说：我们的发言是想要表示中国工人对南也门工人和人民，特别是对他们的武装斗争的坚决支持，想要表达我们对叙利亚、巴勒斯坦等阿拉伯国家和亚非拉国家反帝斗争的坚决支持；我们是想要谴责和揭露世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义及其大帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团；我们是想要揭露联合国是美帝国主义进行侵略的工具。我们在这些方面的观点，反映了亚非拉国家和阿拉伯世界人民和工人的共同要求和愿望。声明说：“中国工会代表团在这里庄严宣布，由于我们的发言权被非法剥夺了，我们不能不退出这个会议。
      “苏联修正主义领导集团和世界工联必须对因此而引起的一切后果负全部责任。”
    声明最后说：“他们的这种卑鄙手法无损于中国工人阶级的一根毫毛。我们中国工人阶级仍将毫不动摇地高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力支持各国工人和人民的革命斗争。”
    越南民主共和国总工会代表团和越南南方解放工会联合会代表团十八日在国际工会支援亚丁工人和人民委员会第三次会议上发表声明。他们对会议主席团无理剥夺中国和阿尔巴尼亚的工会代表团的发言权并迫使它们退出会场的做法，表示遗憾。
