The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front held a meeting at the end of last year. The meeting issued a communiqué stating that the Lao people are determined to engage in a national liberation struggle, further launch a people's war, defeat the U.S. "special war," and overcome the U.S. bandits and their lackeys.

The communiqué first discussed the excellent situation of the national liberation struggle and pointed out: "The imperialist camp led by U.S. imperialism is increasingly fragmented and weakened. U.S. imperialism is strongly opposed by the people of the world, including the American people, and is more isolated than ever."

In condemning the intensified U.S. aggression against Laos over the past year, the communiqué said, "No matter how fiercely U.S. imperialism intensifies its 'special war,' the Lao people will bravely fight back and achieve continuous victories, smashing the enemy's infiltration and occupation, and consolidating the liberated areas."

The communiqué said the meeting called on the people of the entire country to continue to strengthen and build up the armed forces, smash all military aggression by the enemy, and further develop the people's war. In addition, it called on the people of the entire country to consolidate and build the liberated areas, actively raise the people's consciousness, and develop the people's war and promote work in all fields.

The communiqué finally expressed that the Lao people absolutely believe in their own strength and, with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties, smash the aggressive ambitions of U.S. imperialism, and achieve final victory.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, January 11, the Lao Patriotic Front radio broadcasted on January 10 that the Lao patriotic military and people bravely fought back against the enemy's aerial attacks in 1966, achieving brilliant results, and shot down a total of 203 planes of the U.S. bandits and their lackeys.

Thus, from May 17, 1964, to December 26, 1966, the Lao patriotic military and people shot down a total of 447 planes of the U.S. bandits and their lackeys and damaged hundreds more.
