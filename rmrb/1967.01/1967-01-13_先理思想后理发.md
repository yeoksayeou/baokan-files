At the entrance of Pingfu Village, a new volunteer barber has arrived. Every day at noon and after dinner, when the commune members come to get a haircut, they like to study Chairman Mao's quotations with the barber first. Therefore, the commune members all call him the "think politically before getting a haircut" volunteer barber.

This barber is a soldier named Wei Qingcai from the People's Liberation Army. He recently came here with his unit for a political field exercise. Seeing that the commune members were busy with autumn harvest and winter planting, and had no time to go to town for a haircut, he discussed with the leaders and brought his barber tools to open a volunteer barber shop at the village entrance. He uses his free time to give the commune members haircuts. The commune members are naturally very happy.

The barber shop operated for two days, and Wei Qingcai noticed that some commune members did not follow the order to get a haircut and wanted him to cut their hair first. Wei Qingcai saw this situation and thought: Some commune members rush to get their hair cut first, which shows that they have a selfish mindset. It also shows that in the past two days, I have not emphasized politics in my barbering; I only focused on cutting hair and did not do any ideological work. This kind of volunteer barbering can only solve a bit of the commune members' living difficulties, but it does not help with their ideological problems. I should use the opportunity of cutting hair to propagate the idea of doing everything for the benefit of others and selflessly serving the public.

On the third day, Wei Qingcai brought "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and a plaque with Mao's quotations to the volunteer barber shop. When the commune members came to get a haircut, he organized them to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "completely selfless and dedicated to the benefit of others" and "all revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other," and then cut their hair. From then on, the phenomenon of rushing to get a haircut disappeared, and instead, there were touching scenes of people pushing each other to go first. Everyone let others go first and took the difficulties upon themselves. Young commune members would see elderly people and children coming to get a haircut and would voluntarily let them go first. Many commune members, after getting a haircut, would give Wei Qingcai a thumbs up and say: Well done! You not only gave us a haircut but also propagated the idea of eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. You are truly a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought.

    先理思想后理发
    杨衍泉
    平付村的村口上，新来了一位义务理发员。每天中午和晚饭后，社员们来理发的时候，都喜欢先同理发员一起学习一会毛主席语录。因此，社员们都管他叫“先理思想后理发”的义务理发员。
    这位理发员是解放军战士韦庆才，他最近随部队到这里政治野营。看见社员们正忙于秋收冬种，没工夫上街理发，他和领导商量后，便带来理发工具，在村口开了个义务理发店，利用自己的休息时间给社员理发。社员们自然都很高兴。
    理发店开了两天，韦庆才发现，有个别社员理发不按次序，要韦庆才先替自己理。韦庆才看到这些情况，心想：有的社员抢着要先理自己的，说明脑子里有个私字，也说明我这两天理发不突出政治，只顾理发，不做思想工作。这样的义务理发，只能解决社员生活上一点困难，对社员思想上没有什么帮助，应该利用理发的机会，向社员们宣传一切利人、一心为公的思想。
    第三天，韦庆才便带着《毛主席语录》和毛主席语录牌到了义务理发店。社员们来理发的时候，就组织社员一起学习毛主席关于“毫不利己专门利人”和“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，然后才理发。从此，争先理发的现象不见了，随之出现的是你推我让的动人场面。人人把方便让给别人，把困难留给自己，青年社员看见老人和小孩来理发时，就主动让他们先理。许多社员理完发后，都伸出大拇指对韦庆才说：好样的！你不但给我们理了发，也向我们宣传了破私立公，你真是一个毛泽东思想的宣传员。
