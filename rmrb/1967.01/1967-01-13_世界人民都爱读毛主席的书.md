Once, an Iranian friend was resting in the waiting room at Beijing Airport. A service staff member showed him a magazine featuring a photo of Chairman Mao. He proudly said, "I have seen the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao shook hands with me, and we took a photo together. Chairman Mao is in excellent health. This is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people, and it is also the greatest happiness for people around the world."

The service staff member was deeply moved by his sincere affection for Chairman Mao and gave him an English version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He was overjoyed and excitedly told the service staff, "You read Chairman Mao's book and listen to Chairman Mao's words. You are Chairman Mao's good students. Not only do the Chinese people read Chairman Mao's book, but I have been to many countries around the world. I have personally seen that people in many countries love Chairman Mao, believe in Mao Zedong Thought, and love reading Chairman Mao's book."

    世界人民都爱读毛主席的书
    有一次，一位伊朗朋友在北京机场候机室休息。服务员把一本刊登有毛主席照片的画报给他看，他很自豪地说：“我见到了伟大的领袖毛主席，毛主席和我握了手，在一起拍了照。毛主席身体非常健康，这是你们中国人民的最大幸福，也是世界人民的最大幸福。”
    服务员深为他热爱毛主席的真挚感情所感动，送给他一本英文版的《毛主席语录》。他非常高兴，激动地对服务员们说：“你们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，你们是毛主席的好学生。不但你们中国人民读毛主席的书，我到过世界各地，我亲眼看到许多国家的人民都热爱毛主席，信仰毛泽东思想，都爱读毛主席的书。”
