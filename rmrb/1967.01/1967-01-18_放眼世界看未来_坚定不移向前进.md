The blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ignited personally by Chairman Mao, is now burning fiercely across the entire country.

In this great revolutionary era where one day is equal to twenty years, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought people's spiritual world into a brand new stage. This is a new era of earth-shaking and heart-stirring changes, an era of "a world turned upside down." In this short period, China has undergone tremendous changes. Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and a mighty storm has washed away all the rubbish and filth of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. All superstructures that do not conform to or adapt to the socialist economic base have been subjected to powerful impacts and are collapsing or about to collapse. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the revolutionary masses have smashed the old world to pieces, leaving it in ruins. "Those who follow it survive, those who go against it perish." This is the inevitable law of historical development. The living facts of this period eloquently prove this point.

During this short period, we have deeply felt that the great thought of Mao Zedong is the true spiritual atomic bomb of the revolutionary masses. Every victory we have achieved is a victory of Mao Zedong thought, and every achievement glows with the brilliance of Mao Zedong thought. Mao Zedong thought is the magic weapon of revolution, the lifeline of the people of the world and China. Chairman Mao is our supreme commander. Under Chairman Mao's command, we have fought in all directions and been invincible. Under the great helmsman's navigation, millions of revolutionary armies have broken through layer upon layer of stormy waves and navigated around layer upon layer of reefs and shoals, riding the wind and waves, advancing bravely in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary practice of this period can be simply summed up in the two words "rebellion." In the great practice of class struggle, we have only one belief: "Follow Chairman Mao forever and carry out thorough revolution." To defend Chairman Mao and the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we fear neither heaven nor earth, nor ghosts nor gods. "Counter-revolutionaries," "anti-party elements," "fake leftists, real rightists," "extortionists," and the like cannot intimidate us or shake our firm resolve. "Personal gains and losses," "personal future," and other selfish thoughts should all be cast aside. Since we have made up our minds to rebel, we must dare to fight, dare to kill, dare to charge into the fray, dare to engage in hand-to-hand combat; we must have a fearless revolutionary spirit, "be willing to be skinned alive and dare to pull the emperor off his throne." This is our oath.

Rebellion, this is the essence of Marxism-Leninism.

Rebellion, this is the soul of Mao Zedong thought.

Rebellion, this is the dialectics of revolution.

The history of human society is a history of class struggle, a history of revolutionary rebellion. Where there is oppression, there is resistance, there is struggle. Whoever does not rebel is a thorough slave, a hundred percent revisionist. In this great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary people and the Red Guards will rebel against imperialism, rebel against capitalism, rebel against revisionism, and rebel against the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes. We will rebel greatly and specially, and rebel to the end. In short, whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes Mao Zedong thought, we will rebel against them.

At present, before us is a great revolutionary situation. The east wind is strong, red flags are flying, battle cries are thunderous, and victory songs are resounding. The great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is breaking through the resistance of the bourgeois reactionary line and developing in a deeper and broader direction.

The death knell of the bourgeois reactionary line has sounded!

The death knell of all ghosts and monsters has sounded!

Although they are making a last stand and holding fast to their reactionary positions, their doom is sealed. They are lifting stones to drop on their own feet and will ultimately be swept into the dustbin of history by the revolutionary people.

At present, a small number of diehards who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line are like stray dogs and rats crossing the street, everyone is shouting to beat them. Their territory is getting smaller and smaller, and their "followers" are getting fewer and fewer. Those who were once deceived, cheated, and used by them have awakened under the radiance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They are standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line, rising up to rebel, and fiercely striking back at "counter-attacks." The forces of the bourgeois reactionary line are in a state of universal betrayal and collapse.

"Already the new sun rises over the nine provinces, still the thunder roars over the four seas," the revolutionary journey is endless. The task before us revolutionary rebels is heavy and arduous. The victories we have already achieved are only the first step of a ten-thousand-li long march. The experience of class struggle tells us that the enemy will not perish on its own, and reactionary things will not fall if you do not strike them. Those who formulate and implement the bourgeois reactionary line will not meekly confess and surrender to the people.

The experience of class struggle also tells us that we must not pity frozen snakes. We must carry on the spirit of Lu Xun's ruthless beating of fallen dogs. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame by imitating King Xiang Yu." We must strike hard and pursue relentlessly, and we will not stop until we achieve complete victory. On this point, we must stand firm, hold high the banner, and there must be no compromise, no reconciliation, no ambiguity, and no mercy!

In the new year, we must firmly remember the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "All young intellectuals and student youths must combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and become one with them, to form a powerful army." Revolutionary intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants, and student movements must combine with workers' movements and peasants' movements. This is a massive "people's war." Today, we must "kill" from schools to society, to factories and villages, and combine with the workers and peasants, humbly becoming their students, learning and discussing the Cultural Revolution with them. Otherwise, we will achieve nothing, and the Cultural Revolution will be half-hearted. Revolutionary intellectuals can only, in the process of combining with the workers and peasants, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, transform their worldview, and become genuine proletarian intellectuals.

Looking at the future of the world with a broad perspective and advancing resolutely, thinking of the past, looking at the present, and envisioning the future, we are full of confidence and high spirits. Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, we are fully determined to achieve even greater new victories.

The future world will surely be a new world where the great red flag of Mao Zedong thought flies high.

The future world will surely belong to the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong thought.

    放眼世界看未来　坚定不移向前进
    复旦大学“八一”兵团　红哲兵
    毛主席亲自点燃起来的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火已经在全国范围内炽烈地燃烧起来了。
    在这一天等于二十年的大革命时代里，无产阶级文化大革命把人们的精神世界引向了一个崭新的阶段。这是翻天覆地，震撼人心的新时代，这是“换了人间”的新时代。整个中国在这短短的时间内已发生了极大的变化。电光闪闪，雷声隆隆，巨大的暴风雨洗刷了一切封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的垃圾脏物，一切不符合、不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑受到了强大的冲击，它们正在垮台或即将垮台。亿万革命群众在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，把旧世界打得个人仰马翻，落花流水。“顺之者存，逆之者亡”。这是历史发展的必然规律。这一时期的活生生事实雄辩地证明了这一点。
    在这短短的期间内，我们深深地体会到伟大的毛泽东思想是革命群众真正的精神原子弹，我们所取得的每一步胜利都是毛泽东思想的胜利，每一个战果都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。毛泽东思想是革命的法宝，是世界人民和中国人民的命根子。毛主席是我们最高统帅，在毛主席的指挥下，我们南征北战，所向披靡。在伟大舵手的领航下，千百万革命大军，冲破层层惊涛骇浪，绕过层层险滩暗礁，乘风破浪，沿着毛主席所指引的方向奋勇前进。
    这一时期的革命实践可以简单地用“造反”二个字来概括。在阶级斗争的伟大实践中，我们只有一个信念：“永远跟着毛主席，彻底闹革命”。为了捍卫毛主席，捍卫以毛主席为代表的革命路线，我们天不怕、地不怕、鬼不怕、神不怕。什么“反革命”、“反党分子”、“假左派，真右派”、“伸手派”等等都吓唬不了我们，动摇不了我们的坚定意志。什么“个人得失”、什么“个人的前途”等等私心杂念统统滚一边去。既然下定决心造反，就必须敢拚、敢杀、敢闯、敢于冲锋陷阵、敢于刺刀见红；就要有大无畏的革命精神，“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马。”这就是我们的誓言。
    造反，这是马列主义的精华。
    造反，这是毛泽东思想的灵魂。
    造反，这是革命的辩证法。
    一部人类社会发展的历史就是一部阶级斗争的历史，一部革命造反的历史。哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗，就有斗争。谁不造反谁就是十足的奴隶主义，谁就是百分之百的修正主义。在这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大的革命群众，红卫兵小将就是要造帝国主义的反，造资本主义的反，造修正主义的反，造剥削阶级旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的反，要大反特反，一反到底。总之，一句话，谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，就要造谁的反。
    当前，在我们的面前呈现一派大好的革命形势。东风劲吹，红旗招展，杀声雷动，凯歌震天，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命正在冲破资产阶级反动路线的阻力，向着更深入、更广阔的方面发展。
    资产阶级反动路线的丧钟敲响了！
    一切牛鬼蛇神的丧钟敲响了！
    尽管他们负隅顽抗，坚持反动立场，可是他们彻底完蛋的命运是注定了。他们搬起石头砸自己的脚，最终必将被革命人民扫进历史的垃圾箱。
    目前，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，犹似丧家之犬，过街之鼠，人人喊打。他们的地盘越来越小了，他们的“信奉者”越来越少了。过去被他们蒙蔽、欺骗和利用的一些群众，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的光辉照耀下，醒悟过来了。他们纷纷站到无产阶级革命路线一边来，奋起造反，狠杀“回马枪”。资产阶级反动路线势力正处在众叛亲离，土崩瓦解之中。
    “已换九州新日月，还叫四海风雷激”，革命的征途是没有尽头的。任重而道远。摆在我们革命造反者面前的任务是繁重而又艰巨的。我们已经取得的胜利，仅仅是万里长征走完了第一步。阶级斗争的经验告诉我们，敌人是不会自行消灭的，反动的东西，你不打，他是不倒的。制定和执行资产阶级反动路线的人决不会服服贴贴低头认罪，向人民彻底投降。
    阶级斗争的经验还告诉我们，决不应可怜那些冻僵的毒蛇，要发扬鲁迅先生狠打落水狗的精神。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”要猛打猛追，不获全胜，决不收兵。在这一点上，必须立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，决不能有半点折衷，半点调和，半点含糊，半点温情！
    新的一年，我们牢牢记住伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块，和他们变成一体，才能形成一支强有力的军队。”革命知识分子必须同工农群众相结合，学生运动必须与工人运动、农民运动相结合，这才是一场规模巨大的“人民战争”。今天，我们又要从学校“杀”向社会，“杀”向工厂、农村，与工农群众相结合，甘当他们的小学生，同他们一起学习，讨论文化大革命。否则，我们则将一事无成，文化大革命就要半途而废。革命知识分子，也只有在同工农群众结合的过程中，活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己的世界观，使自己成为名副其实的工人阶级知识分子。
    放眼世界看未来，坚定不移向前进，想想过去，看看现在，展望未来，我们信心百倍，斗志昂扬，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，我们完全有决心去夺取更大的新胜利。
    未来的世界必定是毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高飘扬的新世界。
    未来的世界必将属于用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民。
