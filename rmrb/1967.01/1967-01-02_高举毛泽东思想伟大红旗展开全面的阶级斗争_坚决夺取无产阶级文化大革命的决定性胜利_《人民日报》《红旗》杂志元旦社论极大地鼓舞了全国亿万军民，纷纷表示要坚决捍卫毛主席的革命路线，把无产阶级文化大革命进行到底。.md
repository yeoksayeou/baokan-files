The New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily and the Red Flag magazine, "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End," has greatly inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country. Revolutionary masses enthusiastically said that this editorial correctly and vividly reflects the great thought of Mao Zedong. It has sounded the victory song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and blown the battle call for further comprehensive class struggle across the country. At this critical moment, it represents Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee in issuing new orders for the march. Revolutionary masses in various places have expressed that in the new year, they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, seize the decisive victory of the Cultural Revolution, and launch a greater upsurge in socialist revolution and socialist construction.

After this editorial was broadcast by the central and local people's radio stations on New Year's Eve in 1966, revolutionary masses in various places conducted serious study and discussion that very night, reviewing the victorious course of the Cultural Revolution in the previous stage and discussing the action plan for the new year. People welcomed the year 1967 in a fighting atmosphere. As soon as the red sun rose on the first day of the new year, revolutionary masses in various places took to the streets to hold grand oath-taking rallies and demonstrations. Broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary people of all ethnic groups expressed their determination to unite more broadly, launch a more resolute attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society, criticize the capitalist reactionary line more deeply and eliminate its influence, break through all obstacles, seize the decisive victory of struggle, criticism, and reform, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary masses in the capital enthusiastically cheered, "The editorial is great!" They said, the editorial spoke out what we wanted to say and touched our hearts. It has added fuel to our Cultural Revolution. We firmly support it! We will definitely carry it out! Workers of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant said in discussing the editorial that in the new year, they would unite better with revolutionary students to burn the flames of the Cultural Revolution in factories and mines even brighter and stronger. Red Guards of the Yonghong Production Team of Dongsheng People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing said excitedly at a study meeting that this Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death class struggle over whether or not to have proletarian dictatorship, whether or not to have poor and lower-middle peasants, whether or not to have socialism, and whether or not to have Mao Zedong Thought. We vow to seize the final victory in this struggle and ensure that our country will never change color. Revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards of various schools in the capital said that the political tasks proposed by the New Year's Day editorial are completely timely. We must resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, brandish the revolutionary broom under the guidance of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, sweep in schools, sweep in society, and sweep away all harmful elements. We must plan and organize to go to factories and rural areas, unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and strive for the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After studying this editorial, workers in Shanghai pointed out excitedly: This is the new order issued by our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, break through all shackles and obstacles, fully play the role of the main force, further carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly smash the capitalist reactionary line, promote the revolutionization of people's thinking, seize the revolution and promote production, and push forward and develop industrial production. Some workers said: Only under the leadership of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, can there be great democracy for the broad masses. Proletarian democracy is a new development of Chairman Mao's mass line. We criticize and supervise leading cadres, no matter how high their position, if their words and deeds do not conform to Chairman Mao's teachings, the masses can criticize them. Only in this way can the proletarian state never change color.

Revolutionary masses in Tianjin, Shenyang, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Xi'an were elated and proud after hearing the editorial broadcast. Many people also held study and discussion meetings. Comrade Wei Fengying, a worker engineer from the Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Plant, who is known as a good worker of Chairman Mao, led her family to study the editorial today. She said excitedly, the more we study this editorial, the clearer our minds become, the brighter our eyes become, and the more we love our great and wise leader Chairman Mao from the bottom of our hearts. We, the working class, must unite with the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, sharpen our eyes, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, charge into battle, fight bravely, and sweep away all harmful elements. Revolutionary students and teachers of the Southwest Nationalities Institute reviewed the experiences and lessons of the Cultural Revolution movement in 1966, discussed their plans and arrangements for the new year, and expressed their determination to unite more closely with the workers and peasants, forming an even more powerful cultural revolution army. Peasants of the suburban people's communes in Guangzhou City said: At present, a handful of people who insist on the capitalist reactionary line are still playing new tricks. We firmly stand on Chairman Mao's side and thoroughly expose the capitalist reactionary line. Revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, and students in Xi'an, after studying the New Year's Day editorial, held a grand oath-taking rally at the city stadium early this morning, carrying a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, beating drums and gongs, and gathering from all directions.

The New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily and the Red Flag magazine has greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. This morning, in the People's Square of Urumqi City, revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups jointly held a grand oath-taking rally to continue the fierce attack on the capitalist reactionary line. Revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Lhasa, Nanning, and Hohhot studied the New Year's Day editorial with great enthusiasm. Peasants in the suburbs of Lhasa said that to do well in production, one must use Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and grasp class struggle. In the new year, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, actively participate in the Cultural Revolution in rural areas, launch a fierce attack on a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line, and strive for a double harvest of revolution and production. In Nanning City, a Long March team composed of students from various ethnic minorities such as Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, and Mao Nv of the Guangxi Nationalities Institute set out early this morning. They studied the editorial again and again before the ceremony, expressing their determination to take this editorial as the guiding principle and direction of their journey. They also faced the brilliant sunrise, reciting Chairman Mao's teachings, "Intellectuals, if they do not unite with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing," and solemnly vowing: We will definitely follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, not be hothouse flowers, but strong pines on the mountains. We will definitely learn better from the workers and peasants, unite with them, and seize new victories in the Cultural Revolution. Some Mongolian herdsmen from the grasslands of Xilin Gol and Bayannur, who are currently in Hohhot, enthusiastically studied and discussed the New Year's Day editorial. A poor herdsman said: The New Year's Day editorial has pointed out the direction and road for us to achieve greater victories this year. We herdsmen on the grasslands know that without the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, the grasslands would be in danger of returning to the days of suffering. Only by closely following Chairman Mao and carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end can we truly have socialism and communism.

According to Xinhua News Agency, today, from the thousand-mile coastal defense line to the plateau of Tibet, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the southern border posts of the motherland, broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army seriously listened to the New Year's Day editorial of the People's Daily and the Red Flag magazine, "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Through to the End." The cheers of "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" and the songs of "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" echoed throughout the military camps. Many units of soldiers and officers held discussions, sharing their thoughts. Some even copied down the important contents of the editorial from the broadcast and sent them to dispersed outposts. Some organized propaganda teams to go to nearby communities to conduct propaganda.

Soldiers and officers unanimously said in discussions that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has set a great example for the proletariat of the whole world in seizing power, maintaining power, and preventing capitalist restoration. Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved great victories, which is the victory of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. They expressed their determination to firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, overcome all difficulties with the people of the whole country, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Soldiers and officers of a company composed of more than 20 ethnic minorities such as Dai and Jingpo of a unit of the Kunming Army further clarified the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution after studying the editorial. They said, mountains cannot block the golden sun, and distant roads cannot stop the wings of eagles. The Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao will overcome all obstacles and achieve greater victories. We must actively participate in and resolutely defend this great revolution.

Soldiers and officers of the Air Force, Navy, and units in Shenyang, Nanjing, Jinan, Lanzhou, and Chengdu deeply discussed their glorious tasks for the new year while studying the editorial. They realized that to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party and Chairman Mao, the key lies in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They said, the new year will be a year when the invincible thought of Mao Zedong is unprecedentedly popularized and deeply rooted. We must put the study of Chairman Mao's works and the arming of our minds with Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, heavier than everything, greater than everything, and earlier than everything, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. Officers and soldiers of the Beijing and Wuhan units and military regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet expressed their determination to further study "Old Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," oppose various bourgeois ideas, thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line, firmly establish the worldview of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly, and become communists who are dedicated to the public, everything for the public, and lifelong for the public, forever loyal to Chairman Mao. Soldiers and officers stationed on the southeastern coast and the front line of the South China Sea, while the people of the motherland are celebrating the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and welcoming the New Year, are seriously studying the New Year's Day editorial while being on high alert, ready to give the daring enemy a fatal blow at any time. They said: The U.S. imperialists and other reactionaries will not die easily. We must be ready to smash their sudden attacks at any time!
