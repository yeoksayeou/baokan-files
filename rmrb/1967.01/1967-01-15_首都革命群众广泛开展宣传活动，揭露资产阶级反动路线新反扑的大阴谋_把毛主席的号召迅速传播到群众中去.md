The revolutionary organizations and broad revolutionary masses of the capital, following the revolutionary direction and combat tasks pointed out by Chairman Mao, have taken active action and launched a fierce total offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line.

The congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel groups in Shanghai is like a spring thunder, stirring the hearts of the revolutionary masses of the capital. In recent days, the revolutionary workers, students, cadres, and other laboring masses of the capital have formed a propaganda army of tens of thousands, surging from all directions to Tiananmen Square, factories, stations, and streets. They braved the biting cold, beating drums and gongs, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, holding up red banners, and shouting slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Defend to the death the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!" "Grasp the revolution and promote production, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!" They are determined to spread Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party Central Committee's calls to the broad revolutionary masses, making them known to every household. Many Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students from universities and colleges have carried on the glorious tradition of revolutionary forebears' hard struggle and revolution, walking from the suburbs into the city to propagate. They said that the class enemy uses the "sugar-coated bullets" of economic benefits to tempt the working masses, which is a new form of the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the proletariat. Revolutionary students must combine with revolutionary workers and peasants, respond to Chairman Mao's great call, and repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Many revolutionary organizations and Red Guards from various schools have gone deep into the ranks of workers from all over the country who have come to Beijing. While carrying out propaganda activities, they also held denunciation meetings and symposiums with the workers who came to Beijing, exposing and criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They use economic bribes to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, incite a group of workers to leave their production posts, disrupt social production, disrupt the national economy, and squander state property with heinous crimes. Some deceived Shanghai workers' Red Guards, after learning the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram and the January 12 editorial of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, suddenly realized. Many people excitedly said: "Hearing the voice of our beloved Chairman Mao, we are like seeing a beacon in the dark night, recognizing the direction. We are workers, and if we don't work for a few days, our hands itch! We will go back to make up for the lost production and compensate for the losses." They not only expressed their determination to immediately return to their production posts but also voluntarily held meetings to reason with those who deceived them to come to Beijing. Workers from Wuhan, Chongqing, Fushun, and other places said that the counter-revolutionary revisionists attempted to lead the masses' political struggle astray into the path of economism, trying to strangle the Cultural Revolution and undermine the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system. We will never let their plots succeed. Not in a thousand ways! Not in ten thousand ways! If we follow them, our country will change color, and if we follow them, we, the millions of laboring people, will become slaves again! Chairman Mao calls on us to care about national affairs, grasp the revolution, and promote production. This is the top priority of the country at the moment!

In the past few days, many workers have left Beijing and returned to their production posts. Some revolutionary teachers and students from various schools, to assist the revolutionary railway workers of Beijing Station and along the line, recently sent many Red Guards to the station and trains to serve, receiving a warm welcome from the railway workers and workers from other places.

    首都革命群众广泛开展宣传活动，揭露资产阶级反动路线新反扑的大阴谋
    把毛主席的号召迅速传播到群众中去
    许多外地来京工人纷纷返回生产岗位，决心争取文化大革命和生产的双胜利
    本报讯　首都的革命组织和广大革命群众，沿着毛主席指明的革命大方向和战斗任务，积极行动起来，向资产阶级反动路线发动了猛烈的总攻击。
    中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海各革命造反团体的贺电，像一声春雷，激动着首都革命群众的心。连日来，首都的革命工人、革命学生、革命干部和其它劳动群众，组成数以万计的浩浩荡荡的宣传大军，从四面八方涌向天安门广场，涌向工厂、车站和街道。他们冒着凛冽的寒风，敲锣打鼓，抬着毛主席画像，举起鲜红的旗帜，高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“誓死保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！”“抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！”等口号。他们决心把毛主席的指示，党中央的号召，传播到广大革命群众中去，作到家喻户晓。许多大专院校的红卫兵、革命师生，发扬革命先辈的艰苦奋斗闹革命的光荣传统，从郊区步行进城宣传。他们说，阶级敌人用经济福利的“糖衣炮弹”，诱惑工人群众，这是资产阶级对无产阶级猖狂进攻的新形式。革命学生一定要和革命工农结合起来，响应毛主席的伟大号召，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。许多革命学生背着行李，到北京市的工矿企业，和工人一起宣传学习中央贺电和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志一月十二日的社论，宣传毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，宣传无产阶级革命派组织大联合，紧握文化大革命和生产领导权，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑的伟大意义。
    许多院校的革命组织和红卫兵，深入到全国各地来京的工人中间，在开展宣传活动的同时，还和来京的工人一块召开声讨会、座谈会，揭发批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，用经济收买手段，腐蚀群众革命意志，唆使一批工人离开生产岗位，破坏社会生产，破坏国民经济，任意挥霍国家财产的滔天罪行。一些受蒙蔽的上海工人赤卫队员，学了中央贺电和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志一月十二日的社论以后，恍然大悟。许多人激动地说：“听到亲爱的毛主席的声音，我们像在黑夜里看到了明灯，认清了方向。我们是工人，几天不搞生产，手都发痒！我们回去要把耽误的生产赶出来，补偿损失。”他们不但表示要立即返回生产岗位，还自动举行集会，对欺骗他们来京的别有用心的人，进行针锋相对的说理斗争。武汉、重庆、抚顺等地的来京工人说，反革命修正主义分子企图把群众的政治斗争引向经济主义的歧途，妄图扼杀文化大革命，瓦解无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，我们决不能让他们的阴谋得逞。一千个不能！一万个不能！依了他们，我们国家就要变颜色，依了他们，我们千百万劳动人民就要重新做牛做马！毛主席号召我们，要关心国家大事，抓革命，促生产，这就是当前国家的头等大事呵！
    这几天，许多工人纷纷离京，返回生产岗位。一些院校的革命师生，为协助北京车站和沿线的革命铁路员工进行工作，最近派出许多红卫兵到车站和列车上服务，受到铁路员工和外地职工的热烈欢迎。
