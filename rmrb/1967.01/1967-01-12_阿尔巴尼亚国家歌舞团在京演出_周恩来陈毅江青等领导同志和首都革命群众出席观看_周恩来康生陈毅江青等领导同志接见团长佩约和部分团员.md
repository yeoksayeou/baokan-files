The singers, filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao, sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and songs of Chairman Mao's quotations in Chinese. The Albanian comrades' passionate and fighting performances were warmly welcomed by the audience. When a singer wearing a "Red Guard" armband, holding a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang the song "We Should Believe in the Masses, We Should Believe in the Party," the entire audience cheered, waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and clapping rhythmically to express their greetings to the Albanian artistic comrades.
