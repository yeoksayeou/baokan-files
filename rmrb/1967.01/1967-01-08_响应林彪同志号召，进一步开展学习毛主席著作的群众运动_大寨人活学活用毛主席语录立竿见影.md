The cadres and community members of Da Zhai Brigade in Da Zhai Commune, Xi Yang County, Shanxi Province, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's "Quotations from Chairman Mao" effectively in the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works. They have memorized and applied many of Chairman Mao's fundamental viewpoints and aphorisms. This has had an immediate and profound impact on achieving the thought revolution of the people and promoting the three great revolutionary struggles.

The people of Da Zhai have always listened to Chairman Mao's words and acted according to his instructions. Even before the publication of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they had been studying and applying some fundamental viewpoints from Chairman Mao's works in their struggles. For example, in 1963, Da Zhai suffered a once-in-a-century flood, but they did not lose heart. Why? Because Chairman Mao's works gave them boundless strength. In his article "The Failure of Idealist Historical View," Chairman Mao said: "Of all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle on earth can be created." In his article "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao pointed out: "We must learn to view problems comprehensively, not only seeing the positive side but also the negative side. Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." They studied these teachings of Chairman Mao and strengthened their confidence in overcoming the disaster. Chen Yonggui, following Chairman Mao's instructions, encouraged everyone by saying: "People are the greatest joy. The land has been washed away, we will rebuild it. The houses have collapsed, we will build new ones. We will turn the old Da Zhai into a new Da Zhai! Chairman Mao said that under certain conditions, bad things can turn into good things. I believe that although the disaster is a bad thing, we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the leadership of the Party, and the superiority of the collective economy of the people's commune. We can completely turn bad things into good things and build a new Da Zhai from the old one." In this way, the people of Da Zhai did not rely on state relief but relied on the spirit of self-reliance. In one year, they repaired all the land washed away by the water, built new caves and new tile houses, and that year's grain harvest was the best since the cooperative system was established. Since then, these two teachings of Chairman Mao have taken root in their minds.

In 1964, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army donated more than thirty copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to Da Zhai. From then on, the people of Da Zhai have been constantly studying and applying "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Now, every member of Da Zhai Brigade has a shiny red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which they carry with them wherever they go and study wherever they are. They repeatedly study and apply Chairman Mao's many fundamental viewpoints and aphorisms. They also installed Chairman Mao's quotations on walls, in fields, on roads, and in houses, ensuring that they study them at all times, in all places, and in all situations.

The Party branch of Da Zhai leads the entire brigade in studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" by combining the current situation, tasks, and the thoughts and work of the masses. For example, last year Da Zhai experienced a severe drought. To fight against the drought, they studied the most: "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory." "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go. This is what a good comrade should do." and several other quotations and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." In the struggle, they found that some community members were not mentally prepared for the prolonged drought, so they studied "Advantage without preparation is not a real advantage, and there is no initiative. Understanding this, a disadvantaged but prepared army can often launch unexpected offensives and defeat the advantaged enemy." and several other quotations. In agricultural land improvement, they made preparations for both drought and waterlogging. They all studied Chairman Mao's quotations thoroughly and memorized them. Cadres and community members generally can recite many of Chairman Mao's fundamental viewpoints and aphorisms and pay attention to applying them in practice. Last year, Chen Yonggui went abroad to visit Albania. At that time, the brigade's work was led by Jia Chengran. Jia had a tendency to avoid difficulties. At that time, he studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao," learning "Hard work is like a burden placed in front of us, see if we dare to take it on." After studying, his confidence was boosted, and he took on the work. However, he had a quick temper and sometimes had a harsh attitude. Community members gave him feedback. He then studied "We should be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people..." and conducted a self-examination. From then on, he strictly required himself in his work, taking the lead in all hard and heavy work. Once, while repairing a water canal on a half-mountain, the mountain was high and the slope was steep, very dangerous. He and the deputy secretary of the branch, Liang Bianliang, carried the quotation "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory" and rushed up. The community members also followed. Afterwards, Jia Chengran shared his experience, saying that studying a quotation from Chairman Mao once, struggling against "I" once, any difficulty can be overcome.

Now, whether holding a cadre meeting or a community meeting, they study several sections of Chairman Mao's quotations before the meeting as a guiding ideology. Their saying is: Without Mao Zedong Thought, we do not speak. Since the whole country is learning from Da Zhai, the people of Da Zhai have studied and applied the quotation "Modesty promotes progress, arrogance leads to retrogression" the most. They always pay attention to checking the shortcomings in their work and learning from the experiences of other places humbly.

Recently, the people of Da Zhai have been responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call with practical actions, further advancing the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works, requiring everyone to truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the Party branch, they are summarizing and exchanging past learning experiences and conducting mutual teaching and learning activities among the community members. A widespread movement to study, memorize, and apply Chairman Mao's quotations has formed.

### 响应林彪同志号召，进一步开展学习毛主席著作的群众运动  大寨人活学活用毛主席语录立竿见影

    响应林彪同志号召，进一步开展学习毛主席著作的群众运动
    大寨人活学活用毛主席语录立竿见影
    新华社太原七日电　山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队的干部和社员，在活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动中，对《毛主席语录》学得好，用得好。他们背熟、用熟了毛主席的许多基本观点和警句。这对于实现人的思想革命化和推动三大革命斗争，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    大寨人一贯是听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事的。还在《毛主席语录》出版以前，在斗争实践中，他们就学习和运用毛主席著作中的一些基本观点。比如一九六三年大寨遭了百年不遇的洪灾，可是他们没有灰心丧气。为什么呢？因为毛主席著作给了他们无穷的力量。毛主席在《唯心历史观的破产》一文中说：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中指出：“我们必须学会全面地看问题，不但要看到事物的正面，也要看到它的反面。在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”他们学了毛主席的这些教导，坚定了战胜灾害的信心。陈永贵遵照毛主席的教导，鼓动大家说：“人在就是大喜事，地冲了，咱再修，房子塌了咱盖新的，咱还要把破大寨变成新大寨哩！毛主席说，在一定条件下，坏事能变成好事。我看灾害虽然是坏事，但我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有党的领导，有人民公社集体经济的优越性，我们完全可以像毛主席所说的那样，把坏事变成好事，把破大寨建成新大寨。”就这样，大寨人不要国家救济，依靠自力更生精神，一年间修复了水冲的全部土地，盖起了新窑洞、新瓦房，这一年粮食还获得了合作化以来的最好收成。从那以后，毛主席这两条教导就在他们思想上生了根。
    一九六四年，解放军某部赠送了三十多本《毛主席语录》给大寨，从此大寨人就常学常用《毛主席语录》。现在，大寨全队每人手里都有一本红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，走到那里，带到那里，学到那里。对毛主席的许多基本观点和警句，总是反复学，反复用。他们还在田间、地头、街道、房子里到处都装上了毛主席语录牌，做到了时时、事事、处处学。
    大寨党支部领导全队学习《毛主席语录》的方法是：结合当前形势、任务和群众的思想情况和工作情况，选学有关的内容。比如去年大寨很旱，为了同干旱作斗争，他们学得最多的是：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”等几条语录和《愚公移山》。斗争中，他们发现有些社员对长期干旱缺乏思想准备，又学了“优势而无准备，不是真正的优势，也没有主动。懂得这一点，劣势而有准备之军，常可对敌举行不意的攻势，把优势者打败”等几条语录，在农田加工方面做了防旱和防涝两手准备。他们学毛主席语录都做到熟读熟记，干部社员一般都能背诵毛主席的许多基本观点和警句，并且注意在用字上下功夫。去年陈永贵出国去阿尔巴尼亚访问了一次，当时大队的工作由贾承让负责。贾有畏难情绪。当时他就学习《毛主席语录》，学了“艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。”学习后，他的信心足了，把工作担起来了。但是他脾气急躁，有时态度生硬，社员给他提出了批评意见。他又学了“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务，……”这条语录，进行了自我检查。从此他在工作中严格要求自己，一切苦活重活都带头干。一次在半山上修水渠，山高坡陡，非常危险。他和支部副书记梁便良两人提着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的语录牌就冲了上去，社员们也跟着上去了。事后贾承让谈他的体会说，学一次毛主席语录，斗一次“我”字，什么困难都能克服。
    现在，大寨人不论开干部会或社员会，会前都要针对会议内容学几段毛主席语录，作为指导思想。他们的说法是：离开毛泽东思想不说话。由于现在全国都在学大寨，所以大寨人就把“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”一条语录学得最好用得最多。他们随时都注意按这一条检查工作中的缺点，检查虚心学习外地经验的情况。
    最近，大寨人正以实际行动响应林彪副主席的号召，进一步开展学习毛主席著作的群众运动，要求人人把毛泽东思想真正学到手。在党支部领导下，他们正总结和交流过去学习的经验，在社员中开展互教互学的活动。一个普遍学毛主席语录、背毛主席语录、用毛主席语录的学习热潮已经形成。
