The members of our team lacked physical training and were somewhat apprehensive about the long march. Later, seeing many classmates embarking on the Long March, we could no longer stay put. What should we do? With this question in mind, we gathered together to study Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely take the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Chairman Mao's patient teachings boosted our courage, and we decided to embark on the Long March.

On the second day of the march, we encountered a mountain slope that stretched for over ten miles. As we hesitated whether to take a break before continuing, the front row of marchers began reciting Chairman Mao's quotations aloud. Hearing this, everyone's spirits were lifted, and we marched through the slope with renewed vigor.

As we descended the slope and prepared to rest, a train came from the north. The soldiers on the train waved and greeted us. The soldiers threw down three rolls of paper. We picked them up. Upon opening the rolls, we saw Chairman Mao's portrait, and everyone jumped with excitement, saying, "Chairman Mao has come to see our Long March! We must resolutely continue!" When we opened another roll, we saw Chairman Mao's quotation on bright red paper: "Resolutely take the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." After reading it, everyone said, "The soldiers have given us the most precious gift. Chairman Mao supports us, the soldiers support us, and the people of the entire nation support us. We must not disappoint their expectations." Everyone's morale was boosted, and that day we covered over eighty miles.

To ensure we could always see Chairman Mao during the Long March, we framed the portrait given by the soldiers and wrote Chairman Mao's quotations on a board. Whenever we encountered difficulties, we would look at Chairman Mao's benevolent face and recite his quotations. No matter the difficulty or hardship, it was nothing to us.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we finally reached our destination. Looking back on the journey, everyone said, "Every quotation from Chairman Mao is an immense source of strength. Without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we would not have been able to take a single step."

    最珍贵的礼物
    吉林师大“踏破千里雪长征队”
    我们这个队的队员，由于平时缺乏锻炼，对徒步串连有些顾虑。后来，看见许多同学都去长征了，我们也呆不住了。怎么办？带着这个问题，大家坐在一起学习毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的谆谆教导，鼓起了我们的勇气，我们决心去长征。
    第二天行军，就遇上了上下十多里长的山坡路，大家正在犹豫要不要休息一下再走时，前面的队员高声朗诵起毛主席语录。队员们听了，顿时精神振作起来，一鼓作气，走完了这段山坡路。
    下了坡正准备休息，从北方开来一列火车，车上的解放军同志向我们招手致意。解放军同志向我们投下了三卷纸。我们把纸卷拣了起来。打开纸卷一眼就看到了毛主席像，队员们都兴奋得跳了起来，说：毛主席来看我们长征了，我们一定坚决地走下去！当打开另一卷时，鲜红的纸上写着毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”同学们看后都说，解放军同志给我们送来了最珍贵的礼物。毛主席支持我们，解放军支持我们，全国人民都支持我们，我们决不能辜负他们的期望。大家的劲更足了，当天走了八十多里路。
    为了在长征途中经常能够看到毛主席，我们把解放军同志赠给的毛主席像用镜框装起来，把毛主席语录写在语录板上。同学们一遇到困难，看看毛主席那慈祥的面容，再朗诵毛主席语录，什么困难呵，什么艰苦呵，就都不在话下了。
    在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，我们终于胜利地到达了目的地。大家回顾走过的这段路程时说，毛主席的每一条语录都是一股无比巨大的动力。没有毛泽东思想的指引，我们就寸步难行。
