The great achievement of the Chinese people, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in successfully conducting a new nuclear explosion has once again caused great shock to U.S. imperialism and other Western countries.

The U.S. imperialists, who have always relied on brandishing nuclear weapons to intimidate the peoples of the world, are both enraged and terrified by this new heavy blow dealt by the Chinese people to their nuclear blackmail policy. According to news from Washington, while the U.S. imperialists are attempting to belittle China's achievements in this test, some American bourgeois newspapers and politicians cannot but acknowledge the tremendous progress China has made in successfully conducting three nuclear tests in 1966. The Kyodo News Agency's correspondent in Washington reported: "U.S. officials are greatly concerned that the interval between China's nuclear tests has been rapidly shortened, to the point where there are only two months between the fourth and fifth tests."

The New York Times published an editorial stating: "The fact that Beijing was able to conduct three nuclear explosions in one year vividly demonstrates the speed at which its (nuclear weapons development) capabilities are growing." Military commentator Baldwin wrote in this newspaper: "Since China conducted its first nuclear explosion in October 1964, it has quickly conducted one test after another, which has surprised many experts," "China's development in nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them has been faster than expected." He also said: "Some authorities believe that it is not just the Americans who have underestimated China's achievements. They think the Russians have made the same mistake." American "senior nuclear physicist" Ralph Lepp publicly admitted: "Experts who predicted that it would take China a long time to develop their nuclear capabilities were wrong. They had assumed that the Chinese would follow the American method of development."

Some bourgeois newspapers in Western Europe have also pointed out China's great achievements in nuclear testing. Britain's Daily Express wrote: "The speed of China's nuclear tests is unprecedented." The Swedish Daily News said: "In a little over two years, China has conducted five nuclear explosions, 'such rapid progress has shocked experts.' Italy's People's Daily exclaimed: "The Chinese people are advancing at an unexpected speed."

France's La Croix acknowledged: "In any case, when it comes to nuclear testing, the People's Republic of China is moving fast," "it is advancing with giant strides in the atomic field." This newspaper also emphasized: "The technological progress of China's nuclear program is both astonishing and rapid: the achievements are so outstanding, that after the first test, it only took two years to launch a nuclear missile!" Le Combat pointed out that China's continuous success in nuclear testing has left "the Americans repeatedly stunned."

Italian reactionary newspapers are particularly worried about the Chinese people, who are achieving great successes in all fields, being a people "full of revolutionary spirit." They fear the Chinese people developing their own nuclear weapons; but they are even more afraid of the anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people. Some newspapers admit that this revolutionary spirit is "the most effective atomic bomb."

### 中国核爆炸使美国核霸王目瞪口呆  美国西欧报刊惊呼我核试验进展神速出人意外

    中国核爆炸使美国核霸王目瞪口呆
    美国西欧报刊惊呼我核试验进展神速出人意外
    新华社三日讯　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民成功地进行新的核爆炸的巨大成就，又一次引起了美帝国主义和其它西方国家的巨大震惊。
    一向靠挥舞核武器吓唬世界各国人民的美帝国主义，对于中国人民对它的核讹诈政策的这一新的沉重打击，又恼恨、又恐慌。据华盛顿消息，在美帝国主义妄图贬低中国这次试验的成就的同时，美国一些资产阶级报刊和政客也不得不承认中国在一九六六年一年内成功地进行了三次核试验的巨大进展。日本共同社驻华盛顿记者报道说：“美国当局人士对于中国（核）试验的间歇时间迅速缩短，终于到了第四次和第五次之间只有两个月的时间这一点，表示很大的关注。”
    《纽约时报》发表社论说：“北京能够在一年内进行三次核爆炸，这一点生动地证明了它（发展核武器）的能力增长的速度。”美国军事评论员鲍德温也在这家报纸上写道：“自从中国在一九六四年十月进行第一次核爆炸以来，它很快地进行了一次又一次的试验，这种情况出乎许多专家的意料之外”，“中国在核武器以及运载这种武器的手段方面的发展，都比预料的快”。他还说：“有些权威人士相信，低估中国取得的进展的还不单是美国。他们认为，俄国人也犯了同样的错误。”美国“高级核物理学家”拉尔夫·莱普公开承认：“预言中国人民发展他们的核能力要很长时间的专家们是错了，他们曾设想中国人将仿效美国发展的方法。”
    西欧国家的一些资产阶级报刊也指出了中国进行核试验的巨大成就。英国的《每日快报》写道：中国核试验的“发展速度是空前的”。《瑞典日报》说，中国在两年多一点的时间内进行了五次核爆炸，“这种迅速的进展使专家们感到震惊”。意大利的《人民报》惊呼：中国人民正在“以出人意外的速度前进”。
    法国的《十字架报》承认：“无论如何，谈到核试验，人民中国是走得快的”，“它在原子方面正以巨人的步伐向前迈进。”这家报纸还强调指出：“中国核计划的技术进展既惊人，又迅速：成绩是多么的出色，在第一次试验之后，只过了两年就能发射核导弹！”《战斗报》就此指出，中国在核试验方面连续取得成功，使“美国人一再目瞪口呆”。
    意大利的反动报纸对于正在各个方面取得巨大成就的中国人民是“洋溢着革命精神”的人民这一点特别担忧。它们害怕中国人民发展自己的核武器；但是，它们甚至更害怕中国人民的反帝革命精神。有的报纸承认，这种革命精神是“最有效的原子弹”。
