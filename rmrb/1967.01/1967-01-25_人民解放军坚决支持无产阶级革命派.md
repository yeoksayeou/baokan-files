Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage. The main task of struggle in this new stage is for the revolutionary factions of the proletariat to unite, concentrate their forces, and seize power from the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line.

Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have, after twenty-eight years of arduous struggle, seized power nationwide and established a proletarian dictatorship. However, a handful of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party are unwilling to accept the demise of the exploitative system. They have usurped leadership in some places and departments, practicing bourgeois dictatorship, and are doing everything they can to drag socialist China towards capitalism. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is only natural for the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat to seize power from them. This struggle for power is a comprehensive counterattack against the seventeen-year-long assault by the bourgeois agents within the Party on the proletariat. The distinctive feature of this power struggle is that hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have launched a conscious mass movement; under the support of the Party Central Committee led by our great leader Chairman Mao, they have, from the bottom up, one by one, seized the positions occupied by the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; they have used various new forms that have emerged in the mass movement to thoroughly eliminate the old things of the exploiting classes and revisionism, and to thoroughly reform all the superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base.

We, the People's Liberation Army, are the revolutionary army of the proletariat personally created by Chairman Mao, and the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. In this great struggle of the proletariat seizing power from the bourgeoisie, we must resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat. The People's Liberation Army must resolutely support and assist the revolutionary factions of the proletariat. This is the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao. We must follow Chairman Mao's words, and wholeheartedly, unhesitatingly, and wholeheartedly support the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in seizing power. Even if they are temporarily in the minority, we must support them without hesitation.

In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army cannot avoid getting involved. Some people, under the pretext of "non-intervention," are actually suppressing the masses. This is absolutely unacceptable. Their so-called "non-intervention" is false. The issue is not one of intervention or non-intervention, but of which side to stand on—whether to support the revolutionary factions of the proletariat or to support the conservatives, or even the rightists. In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the current intense class struggle, not standing on the side of the proletariat means standing on the side of the bourgeoisie, and not standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao means standing on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line. There can be no compromise, no reconciliation, no neutrality in this. We, the People's Liberation Army, should actively and clearly support the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat.

All genuine revolutionary factions of the proletariat who seek the support and assistance of the military should have their requests met. The People's Liberation Army should carry forward the fine tradition of doing mass work, and in supporting the local Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, should unite with the revolutionary factions of the proletariat and the revolutionary masses, learn from the masses, and propagate the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, helping the revolutionary factions of the proletariat to grow and strengthen.

"The gun is the ultimate arbiter." The proletarian dictatorship was seized by the people's army with guns, and it must also be defended by the people's army with guns. Those who sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the counter-revolutionary elements and organizations must be firmly suppressed, and the proletarian dictatorship must be enforced.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese Red Army is a revolutionary armed force that carries out political tasks." The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat seizing power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road ensures that our country will remain red for thousands of generations. This is the greatest political task of the proletariat. We, the People's Liberation Army, are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We have faithfully defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and made our contributions. In the struggle to support the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in seizing power, we will make new and greater contributions.

Comrades, in the past, we braved fire and water, fought to the death, and built an everlasting merit for the people by seizing the mountains and rivers. Now, in this fierce class struggle, we must become the pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao: enthusiastically support Chairman Mao, warmly support the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, and resolutely strike down the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, forever preserving the most brilliant banner of our great People's Liberation Army.

### 人民解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命派

　　人民解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命派
    在我们的伟大领袖毛主席领导下，我国无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段。这个新阶段的主要的斗争任务，就是无产阶级革命派大联合，集中力量，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子夺权。
    中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导下，经过二十八年的艰苦奋战，在全国范围内夺得了政权，建立了无产阶级专政的国家。可是，有一小撮混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，不甘心于剥削制度的灭亡，他们篡夺了一些地方和一些部门的领导权，实行资产阶级专政，千方百计地想要把社会主义中国拉向资本主义。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级的革命造反派起来从他们手里夺权，这是天经地义的。这次夺权斗争，是对钻进党内的资产阶级代理人十七年来向无产阶级进攻的一个总反击。这次夺权斗争的特点，是亿万革命人民在毛泽东思想统帅下的自觉的群众运动；是在以伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央支持下、自下而上地一个一个夺取被一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派所盘踞的阵地；是用群众运动中涌现的各种新形式，来彻底消除剥削阶级和修正主义的旧东西，彻底改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。
    我们人民解放军，是毛主席亲自缔造的无产阶级的革命军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石。在这场伟大的无产阶级向资产阶级夺权的斗争中，我们必须坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边。人民解放军必须坚决支持和援助无产阶级革命派，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召。我们一定要听毛主席的话，要满腔热忱地、毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持无产阶级的革命造反派起来夺权。即使他们暂时是少数，也要毫不犹豫地支持他们。
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，人民解放军是不能不介入的。有些人假借“不介入”之名，行压制群众之实。这是绝对不能允许的。他们的所谓“不介入”，是假的。问题不是介入不介入的问题，而是站在哪一边的问题，是支持无产阶级革命派，还是支持保守派甚至右派的问题。在当前这场无产阶级文化大革命中，在当前激烈的阶级斗争中，不站在无产阶级一边，就站在资产阶级一边，不站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，就站在资产阶级反动路线一边。这中间，不能折中，不能调和，不能中立。我们人民解放军，应该鲜明地、积极地支持无产阶级革命左派。
    凡是真正的无产阶级革命派，要军队支持和援助，都应当满足他们的要求。人民解放军要发扬做群众工作的优良传统，在支援地方无产阶级文化大革命中，同无产阶级革命派打成一片，同革命群众打成一片，向群众学习，向群众宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，帮助无产阶级革命派发展壮大。
      “枪杆子里面出政权”。无产阶级的政权，是人民军队用枪杆子夺来的，也要靠人民军队用枪杆子来保卫。对于那些破坏无产阶级文化大革命的现行反革命分子和反革命组织，必须进行坚决镇压，实行无产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”无产阶级的革命造反派起来夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，保证我们的国家千秋万代永不变色，这是无产阶级的最大的政治。我们人民解放军是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的。我们忠实地保卫了无产阶级文化大革命，做出了自己的贡献。在支持无产阶级革命派起来夺权的斗争中，我们要做出新的更大的贡献。
    同志们，过去，我们赴汤蹈火，前赴后继，为人民打下了江山，建立了不朽的功勋。现在，在这场严峻的阶级大搏斗中，我们要成为保卫无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱。我们要遵照林彪同志的指示：热烈地拥护毛主席，热情地支持无产阶级革命左派，狠狠地打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，永远保持我们伟大人民解放军的最鲜红的旗帜。
