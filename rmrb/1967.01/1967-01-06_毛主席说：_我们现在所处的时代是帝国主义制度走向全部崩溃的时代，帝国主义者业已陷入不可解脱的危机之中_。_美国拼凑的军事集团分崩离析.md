Chairman Mao says: “We are now in an era where the imperialist system is heading towards complete collapse. Imperialists have fallen into an irredeemable crisis.”

The military alliances assembled by the United States are disintegrating.

Under the impact of the revolutionary storms of the people of the world, the power of American imperialism is declining day by day. The difficulties within the imperialist camp are increasing, and contradictions are sharpening. The various military alliances that the United States has assembled to carry out its global aggression policy, especially the North Atlantic Military Alliance, which is a crucial pillar of its aggression policy, are crumbling.

France, which holds an irreplaceable strategic position in the North Atlantic Alliance, seized the opportunity when the United States shifted its strategic focus from Europe to Asia and weakened its control over Western Europe. Last July, it abruptly withdrew from the military institutions of this alliance and ordered this alliance and the American command and military bases in its territory to be completely moved out by April 1967. France's move completely disrupted the United States' strategic deployment in Western Europe, removed the backbone of the North Atlantic Alliance, and encouraged other Western European countries to seek independence from the United States, leaving the United States in a miserable state.

The United States, in order to carry out its global aggression policy, has tried every means to turn this alliance into a tool for furthering the "peaceful evolution" of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. The American imperialists believe that this can also maintain this fragmented military alliance for a while. However, the United States' allies also have their own plans on this issue and are drifting away from the United States. The United States' attempts to use the North Atlantic Alliance to drag its allies into the war in Vietnam and anti-China "crusade" activities have repeatedly failed. All this shows that the United States' command in the imperialist camp has completely lost its effectiveness, and its hegemonic position has plummeted.

The other two military alliances that the United States has painstakingly assembled—the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Central Treaty Organization—have long been paralyzed or exist in name only.

The reason why these military alliances assembled by the United States have ended up this way is not accidental. This is primarily the result of the deepening development of the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world, especially the huge failure of the United States in its aggression against Vietnam. The unprecedented isolation of the United States and the disintegration of the Western camp are also the result of the uneven development of capitalist economies and the unprecedented sharpening of contradictions between capitalist countries. The changes in the economic strength of various imperialists and the life-and-death struggles in the fields of trade and finance will inevitably reflect in the political arena, further exacerbating the fragmentation of the Western camp.

With the further strengthening of the revolutionary forces of the people of the world and the further sharpening of the contradictions within the imperialist camp, the process of the disintegration of the imperialist camp will accelerate, ultimately leading to its complete collapse.

    毛主席说：“我们现在所处的时代是帝国主义制度走向全部崩溃的时代，帝国主义者业已陷入不可解脱的危机之中”。
    美国拼凑的军事集团分崩离析
    在全世界人民革命风暴的打击下，美帝国主义势力日益衰落，帝国主义阵营内部困难加重、矛盾激化，美国为推行全球侵略政策而拼凑起来的各种军事集团，特别是作为侵略政策重要基石的北大西洋军事集团，正在土崩瓦解。
    在北大西洋集团里占有不可代替的战略重要地位的法国，趁美国战略重点从欧洲移到亚洲、对西欧控制削弱的时机，去年七月断然退出了这个集团的军事机构，并且限令这个集团和美国在法国境内的司令部和军事基地在一九六七年四月以前统统搬走。法国这一手，完全打乱了美国在西欧的战略部署，抽掉了北大西洋集团的脊骨，并且鼓励了其他西欧国家向美国闹独立，使美国狼狈不堪。
    美国为了推行它的全球侵略政策，竭力设法使这个集团变为对苏联和东欧国家进一步推行“和平演变”的工具。美帝国主义者认为，这样也可以维系一下这个四分五裂的军事集团。但是，美国的盟国在这个问题上也各有打算，同美国离心离德。美国想利用北大西洋集团把盟国拖进侵越战争和反华“十字军”的活动，也一再碰壁。这一切都表明，美国在帝国主义阵营中的指挥棒完全失灵，霸主地位一落千丈。
    美国苦心拼凑起来的另外两个军事集团——东南亚条约组织和中央条约组织，也早已陷于瘫痪，或名存实亡。
    由美国一手拼凑起来的这些军事集团所以落得如此下场，绝非偶然。这首先是世界人民革命斗争深入发展，特别是美国在侵略越南的战争中遭受巨大失败的结果。美国的空前孤立和西方阵营的分崩离析，也是资本主义经济发展不平衡、资本主义国家之间矛盾空前激化的结果。各个帝国主义的经济实力的变化和贸易、金融领域内你死我活的斗争必然反映到政治领域中，从而加剧西方阵营支离破碎的局面。
    随着世界人民革命力量的进一步壮大和帝国主义阵营内部矛盾的进一步激化，帝国主义阵营分崩离析的过程还要加速，最后必然全面崩溃。
