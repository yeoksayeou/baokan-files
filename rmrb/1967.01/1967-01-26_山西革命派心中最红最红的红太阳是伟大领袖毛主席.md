The sky of Shanxi belongs to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat
The land of Shanxi belongs to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat
The reddest red sun in the hearts of Shanxi revolutionaries is the great leader Chairman Mao

A grand rally of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanxi to unite and seize power was held in Taiyuan, enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in Shanxi

Representatives of the Shanxi Military Region, revolutionary cadres of Shanxi Province, workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary rebels resolutely declared that they will seize back all the powers.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 25th: After the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcasted the "First Notice of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters" and the People's Daily editorial "The Great Victory of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat in Shanxi Province," the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people in Shanxi, who have regained the seals and become the masters, spread the news and rejoiced greatly, enthusiastically celebrating this as the most intimate care and greatest support from our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. The slogan "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" echoed across Shanxi.

Today, many revolutionary rebel organizations have rushed to join the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters. The great unity of the Shanxi revolutionary rebels is flourishing, and the mighty army of revolutionary rebels is growing stronger.

On the 25th, the entire city of Taiyuan was in a festive mood all day, as if celebrating a grand festival. Over ten thousand people gathered in the spacious "May 1st Square" to hold a grand rally of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanxi to unite and seize power. The rally declared that the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanxi will advance victoriously and launch a comprehensive offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, seizing back all the powers they have usurped and firmly holding them in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

The representative of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters read a telegram of respect to our great leader Chairman Mao at the rally. The telegram said:

"When we heard the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast our headquarters' first notice and saw the People's Daily editorial 'The Great Victory of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat in Shanxi Province,' our hearts were filled with immense excitement. This is your greatest care, greatest encouragement, greatest support, and greatest urging for us. 'We can shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' a thousand times, ten thousand times, but we cannot express our boundless love for you; we can sing 'The East is Red' a thousand times, ten thousand times, but we cannot sing out our resolve to follow you in revolution forever.' 'We deeply understand that the great proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by you is an unprecedented great revolutionary struggle in human history. We are doing what no one has ever done before. The enemies we face are not just a handful of bad guys in Shanxi Province, but the entire old world. We have an unshakable belief: with you leading the way, we revolutionary rebels of the proletariat can sweep away all the filth and vermin! With our iron fists, we will create a red Shanxi! A new China! A new world!"

Today, the atmosphere of celebration and continued struggle filled the entire city. Before the rally, in factories, schools, suburban people's communes, and the stations of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary soldiers rushed to the streets and alleys, posting tens of thousands of big red victory announcements. From early morning, people formed mighty columns, holding up giant portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, waving red flags, beating drums, and marching to the streets, propagating the "First Notice of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters" and the People's Daily editorial "The Great Victory of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat in Shanxi Province." People cheered for the unity of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat among workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals; they cheered for the unity of the revolutionary cadres in the Shanxi leadership organs who stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao; they cheered for the great army of the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanxi, which has grown stronger and finally seized back the powers usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; they cheered that the sky of Shanxi belongs to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and the land of Shanxi belongs to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. People cheered a thousand times, ten thousand times, expressing the happiest feelings and most intimate voices of all revolutionary rebels and revolutionary people: Chairman Mao, you are the reddest red sun in our hearts! The victory of the Shanxi revolutionary rebels' struggle to seize power is the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, and a new great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The rally began at 2 p.m. with the entire audience singing "The East is Red." People held up red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," reciting Chairman Mao's teachings: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism."

"The reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All reactionaries are paper tigers. In essence, it is because of the people's support that the reactionaries are able to stand. The people have the right to rebel, and everything reactionary is the same. Once the people rise up, they can always find a way."

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanxi actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, firmly supporting the revolutionary rebels. Today, at the rally, teams of armed and mighty soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stood at the front of the venue. Around the venue and the podium, soldiers maintained order. The firm support of the People's Liberation Army made the revolutionary rebels proud and the class enemies tremble with fear.

The chairman of the rally pointed out in his speech that the revolutionary masses should take control of their own destiny. Among countless things, the most important is to take control of the seal. With power comes everything, without power comes nothing. The revolutionary masses of the entire province, with their deep hatred for the class enemies, gritted their teeth and made a firm decision to unite and seize back all the powers usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line!

At the rally, Zhang Riquing, the second political commissar of the Shanxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, spoke first. He represented the Shanxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and all the soldiers stationed in Shanxi, declaring their firm response to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao that the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left. He said, "We warmly congratulate and firmly support the revolutionary organizations and representatives of the proletariat in Shanxi Province uniting and seizing back all the powers usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Let the proletariat and laboring people of Shanxi Province regain control of the seals of the entire province and become the masters of the house! You are right, you are doing well, we firmly support your revolutionary actions, we firmly stand on your side. You are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, standing firmly on the side of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, insisting on the great direction of the socialist revolution, insisting on the dictatorship of the proletariat, and defending the great Mao Zedong Thought."

He also, on behalf of all the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanxi, announced five specific regulations, expressing firm support for the revolutionary masses. If the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat need military support, soldiers will be immediately dispatched to support and assist, fighting side by side with the revolutionary rebels, firmly suppressing the counter-revolutionary organizations and elements that oppose the revolutionary left of the proletariat.

Zhang Riquing said in conclusion, "We must firmly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, put politics in command, go among the revolutionary masses, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and make the great proletarian cultural revolution even better."

Liu Guan, a member of the Standing Committee of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and deputy governor of Shanxi Province, spoke on behalf of himself and the revolutionary cadres Liu Geping, He Yingcai, Yuan Zhen, and Chen Shouzhen in the Shanxi leadership organs at the rally. He enthusiastically celebrated the decisive victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in the cultural revolution of the proletariat in Shanxi Province. He said, "We few comrades solemnly declare at this rally: We firmly stand with the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in Shanxi Province, firmly support the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. Even if we break our bones and shed blood, we will struggle and fight with the revolutionary rebels! Struggle to the end, fight to the end! Please accept our sincere intentions and give the greatest test of proletarian revolution to our actions."

The worker representative from the Taiyuan Textile Mill, Xie Yue, spoke on behalf of herself and Chen Yonggui and Li Shunda. She excitedly said, "After a hard struggle, the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in Shanxi Province have finally united and emerged. Our great seizure of power is justified! It is justified! We enthusiastically celebrate this great storm of seizure of power with the momentum of overturning mountains and the force of thunder, pushing the cultural revolution in Shanxi Province into a new and leaping stage. Xie Yue said, 'Above all, revolutionaries must seize the seal! Above all, seizing power is the most important! Xie Yue also called on all revolutionary rebels to unite and seize power! Seize power! Seize power! And complete the glorious and great historical task entrusted by our great leader Chairman Mao!"

The representative of the Shanxi revolutionary workers said in his speech, "Long live our reddest red sun, our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! We are so happy! So comfortable! The first notice of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters shows the mighty power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, which is a new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The future of the revolution is bright, the road is tortuous, and the struggle is repeated. Every step forward by the revolutionary rebels must overcome countless obstacles and go through arduous struggles. We think of Chairman Mao's wise leadership, and we are full of confidence. We will unswervingly continue to fight. Truth is on our side, and the great Mao Zedong Thought guides our struggle. Victory will surely belong to the revolutionary rebels."

The representative of the Shanxi revolutionary peasants said in his speech, "The first notice of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters was broadcast nationwide, and our hearts are boiling with passion. We cannot suppress our excitement, and we shout 'Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!' over and over again. The first notice speaks for the hearts of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, expresses the strong wishes of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, and expresses our iron will to thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line."

The representative of the Red Rebel Corps of a certain air force school of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanxi emphasized in his speech, "The People's Liberation Army is the revolutionary army of the proletariat personally created and led by Chairman Mao, and it is the most important tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We firmly support the first notice of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, and we firmly support the great unity and seizure of power of the revolutionary left. We solemnly warn those who fan the wind from behind and point their spears at the dictatorship of the proletariat and the revolutionary headquarters of the proletariat: You will be beaten to a pulp in the face of the great unity of the revolution, and you will be smashed to pieces in the face of the powerful dictatorship of the proletariat and the People's Liberation Army!"

One after another, the representatives of the revolutionary rebels ascended the podium to speak. Congratulatory telegrams and letters from various places in Shanxi and many provinces and cities across the country were sent to the podium like snowflakes.

The masses who were previously deceived and joined the royalist organizations are waking up one after another. Today, some of them formally announced their break with this organization at the rally. They resolutely declared that they would surrender to the truth, approach the revolutionary rebels, and firmly return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

At 6 p.m., the rally ended with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." After the rally, the revolutionary masses participating in the rally held demonstrations and parades in groups. The revolutionary rebel warriors decided, under the intimate guidance and care of Chairman Mao, to advance victoriously, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist nests in the great class struggle of unity and seizure of power, seize all the powers, truly put them in the hands of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, and make the sky of Shanxi Province the sky of Mao Zedong Thought, and the land of Shanxi Province the land of Mao Zedong Thought!
