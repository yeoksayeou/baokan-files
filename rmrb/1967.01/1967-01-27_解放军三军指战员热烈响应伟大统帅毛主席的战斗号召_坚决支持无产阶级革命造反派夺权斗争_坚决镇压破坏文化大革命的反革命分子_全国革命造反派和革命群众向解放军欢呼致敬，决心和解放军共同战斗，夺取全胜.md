The PLA troops and fighters enthusiastically respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's battle call, resolutely supporting the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, and resolutely suppressing the counter-revolutionary elements that sabotage the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses across the country cheer and salute the PLA, determined to fight alongside the PLA to achieve complete victory.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 26th, "Resolutely support the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat! Resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary elements and organizations that sabotage the proletarian Cultural Revolution!" This is the most resolute and loudest pledge made by the PLA troops and fighters of the army, navy, and air force, enthusiastically responding to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao.

At this critical moment when the proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the power seizure struggle, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a new battle command to the entire army, stating that the PLA should actively support the broad masses of the left. Chairman Mao's great call has expressed the sentiments of all the soldiers in the army. The troops in Nanjing, Lanzhou, Shenyang, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Fuzhou, and the military regions of Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia have sent decision letters in droves to the leadership of their units. Solemn oath-taking rallies have been held on the front-line artillery positions, airfields, and the decks of ships patrolling the seas of our motherland. The troops, gripping their shining rifles, solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao: We will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great instructions, learn from the troops of the Shanxi Military Region and a certain unit of the Harbin garrison, and with actual actions, resolutely support the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat against those in power who are taking the capitalist road. We will forever stand shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, united, fighting together, and achieving victory together with the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat!

While cheering the excellent situation of the proletarian Cultural Revolution, the troops have focused on studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On People's Democratic Dictatorship" and reviewing Chairman Mao's teachings on the issue of power. The troops say, the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. Without power, there is nothing; with power, there is everything. A soldier from a certain company in the Guangzhou troops, Pan Zhigao, said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the seizure of power, the consolidation of power. And the counter-revolutionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces, precisely for the purpose of maintaining their power." The proletariat revolts and fights for liberation, precisely for the seizure of power. Above all, seizing power is the most important. Without seizing the power of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, the country will change color, and the proletariat will be beheaded.

The troops of the Navy, Air Force, and the Beijing, Kunming, and Jinan units say, since the day our Chinese People's Liberation Army was established, it has been the most resolute in standing on the side of the revolutionary people, and enthusiastically supporting the left is determined by the nature of our army. Today, in this sharp power seizure struggle, we must closely follow Chairman Mao, firmly and unshakably stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, and make greater and newer contributions to the people and the proletarian Cultural Revolution. A soldier from a certain unit in the Beijing troops said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "To stand firmly with the Chinese people, to serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly, is the sole purpose of this army." The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat seizing power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road is a matter of great significance for the revolutionary cause, a matter of great significance for the people of the entire country. We resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and support the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 26th, the great battle call issued by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao to the People's Liberation Army, stating that the PLA should actively support the broad masses of the left, as well as the editorial "The People's Liberation Army Resolutely Supports the Revolutionary Rebels of the Proletariat" in the PLA Daily, has sparked enthusiastic cheers among the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country. They cheer that Chairman Mao's great battle call is the greatest care and support for the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat across the country, and cheer that the proletarian revolutionary army personally created by Chairman Mao is forever the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the bulwark of defending the proletarian Cultural Revolution in this severe class struggle. They cheer to the PLA troops and fighters a thousand times: Let us unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight together, and achieve victory together!

Revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and revolutionary masses in various places have also enthusiastically expressed that Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions to the People's Liberation Army: enthusiastically support Chairman Mao, enthusiastically support the revolutionary left of the proletariat, and severely strike down a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, forever maintain the most brilliant flag of our great People's Liberation Army, is not only a great call to the People's Liberation Army but also a great call to the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and all revolutionary people across the country. They have expressed their determination to learn from the example of the People's Liberation Army, forever follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, resolutely strike down all ghosts and snakes, forever hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for the great cause of communism to the end.

In the past two days, the broad leftist masses in the capital have been extremely elated, saying: The red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, cares the most for the revolutionary left and supports the revolutionary left the most. At this critical moment, he has sent the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and the people, the PLA, to aid us. The PLA is heart to heart with us and stands firmly with us. A handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line will not be able to play any tricks. We will definitely expose them. If they do not surrender, we will resolutely suppress them.

The revolutionary rebel soldiers of the Shanghai Railway Bureau said, Chairman Mao so resolutely supports and cherishes us revolutionary rebels. We will fear neither heaven nor earth, dare to climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire. Whoever dares to oppose our most beloved Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will smash their dog heads!

The revolutionary rebels of the Tientsin Heavy Industry Five-Metal Products Factory said, the PLA resolutely supports and aids us. We have a strong backing, and our confidence in seizing power is even greater.

The revolutionary rebels and broad revolutionary masses in Shenyang and Changchun said with great emotion, with the strong People's Liberation Army personally created by Chairman Mao as our backing, we are fearless, our confidence is doubled. We will definitely be able to defeat all ghosts and snakes and firmly grasp all the power of the socialist state in the hands of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat.

In Wuhan, the revolutionary rebels of the "September 13" Mao Zedong Thought Combat Brigade of Wuhan Steel said: Chairman Mao's instructions to the People's Liberation Army are also a great call to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to achieve great unity and launch a comprehensive attack on the bourgeois reactionary line. It is an important guarantee for our revolutionary rebels to achieve great unity and seize power comprehensively and achieve victory. It tolls the death knell for the complete bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line.

In Lhasa, more than five thousand revolutionary rebel masses held a celebration rally and parade on the 25th. The parade participants carried portraits of Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, and went to the garrison of the PLA Tibet Military Region to express their respect to the PLA.

    据新华社二十六日讯　“坚决支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争！坚决镇压破坏无产阶级文化大革命的现行反革命分子和反革命组织！”这是人民解放军陆海空三军指战员，热烈响应伟大统帅毛主席的伟大号召，发出的最坚定、最响亮的誓言。
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们的伟大领袖毛主席向全军指战员发出人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的新的战斗命令。毛主席的伟大号召，说出了全军同志的心里话。南京、兰州、沈阳、成都、广州、武汉、福州等部队和西藏、新疆、内蒙古军区广大指战员，一张张决心书，雪片般地飞向部队领导机关，一个个誓师大会，在前线炮阵地、停机坪以及巡航在祖国海洋的舰艇甲板上隆重举行。指战员们紧握擦得乌亮的钢枪，庄严地向毛主席宣誓：坚决贯彻执行毛主席的伟大指示，向山西省军区和哈尔滨驻军某部指战员学习，以实际行动，坚决支持无产阶级革命派向走资本主义道路当权派展开的夺权斗争，永远和无产阶级革命派肩并肩，心连心，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    各部队指战员在欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势的同时，着重学习了毛主席的光辉著作《论人民民主专政》，重温毛主席关于政权问题的教导。指战员们说，革命的根本问题是政权问题。没有政权，就没有一切；有了政权，就有了一切。广州部队某连五好战士潘志高说，毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”无产阶级闹革命、闹翻身，就是为了夺权。千重要，万重要，掌握大权最重要。不夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，无产阶级专政就不可能巩固，国家就要变颜色，无产阶级就要人头落地。
    海军、空军和北京、昆明、济南等部队广大指战员说，我们中国人民解放军从建立的那一天起，就是最坚定地站在革命人民一边，热情地支持革命左派是我军的本质所决定的。今天，在这场尖锐的夺权斗争中，我们要紧紧地跟着毛主席，毫不含糊地坚定不移地站在无产阶级革命派一边，为人民、为无产阶级文化大革命做出更大更新的贡献。北京部队某部指战员说，毛主席教导我们：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”无产阶级革命派向走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，这是革命事业的百年大计、千年大计、万年大计，这是全国人民的最大利益所在。我们坚决和无产阶级革命派站在一边，支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。
    据新华社二十六日讯　我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席向人民解放军发出的人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的战斗号召，以及《解放军报》社论《人民解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命派》，在全国无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众中引起热烈的欢呼。他们欢呼毛主席的这一伟大战斗号召是对全国无产阶级革命派的最大关怀和最大支持，欢呼毛主席亲自缔造的无产阶级革命军队永远是无产阶级专政的柱石，在当前这场严峻的阶级大搏斗中又是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱。他们向人民解放军指战员们千百遍地欢呼：让我们在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    各地的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众还热烈表示，林彪副主席对人民解放军所作的指示：热烈地拥护毛主席，热情地支持无产阶级革命左派，狠狠地打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，永远保持我们伟大人民解放军的最鲜红的旗帜，不但是对人民解放军的伟大号召，也是对全国无产阶级革命派和全体革命人民的伟大号召。他们表示一定要学习人民解放军的榜样，永远跟着毛主席闹革命，坚决打击一切牛鬼蛇神，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为共产主义的伟大事业奋斗到底。
    这两天，首都广大左派群众无限欢欣鼓舞地说：我们心中的红太阳毛主席最关怀革命左派，最支持革命左派，在这关键时刻又派最忠于毛泽东思想、最忠于人民的解放军来援助我们。人民解放军和我们心连着心，和我们紧紧地站在一起，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙，不管耍什么花招，我们一定能揭穿他，他不投降，就坚决镇压他。
    上海铁路局革命造反派战士说，毛主席这样坚决地支持和爱护我们革命造反派，我们一定天不怕，地不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，谁敢反对我们最最敬爱的毛主席，反对伟大的毛泽东思想，我们就砸烂他的狗头！
    天津市重光五金制品厂的革命造反派说，人民解放军坚决支持和援助我们，我们有了坚强的后盾，夺权的信心更足了。
    沈阳、长春两个市的革命造反派和广大革命群众万分激动地说，有毛主席亲自缔造的强大的人民解放军做我们的后盾，我们浑身是胆，信心倍增，我们一定能够把一切牛鬼蛇神打个落花流水，把社会主义国家的一切大权牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。
    在武汉，武钢毛泽东思想“九·一三”战斗兵团的革命造反派说：毛主席对人民解放军的指示，也是向工农兵发出的实行大联合向资产阶级反动路线发动全面总攻击的伟大号召，是我们革命造反派大联合开展全面夺权取得胜利的重要保证，它敲响了资产阶级反动路线彻底破产的丧钟。
    拉萨市革命造反派群众五千多人于二十五日举行了庆祝集会和游行。游行的人们抬着毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，到人民解放军西藏军区驻地，向人民解放军表示敬意。
