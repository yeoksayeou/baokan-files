Hanoi's overseas Chinese representatives held a grand meeting on December 29 to warmly celebrate the success of the motherland's new nuclear test and to warmly acclaim the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

At the beginning of the meeting, representatives from various sectors of the overseas Chinese community first opened the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read them aloud together, then the entire audience sang "The East is Red" to express their boundless love and profound respect for the great leader Chairman Mao.

Liao Sheng, Chairman of the Hanoi Overseas Chinese Federation, spoke at the meeting. He said, the great motherland has successfully conducted a new nuclear test, which makes overseas Chinese feel extremely elated and inspired. This success is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and it is a fruitful result of the great proletarian cultural revolution that is vigorously underway in the motherland.

Liao Sheng said, the motherland's successful nuclear test is a heavy blow to American imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and all ghosts and monsters at home and abroad. It is a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression for national salvation and to all revolutionary people around the world. It is a major contribution to the defense of world peace.

Liao Sheng called on the overseas Chinese in Hanoi to enthusiastically respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, to hold high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to resolutely fight alongside the Vietnamese brothers to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.

Representatives from various sectors also spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically celebrating the success of the motherland's new nuclear test.

At the end of the meeting, the entire audience enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The Hanoi "New Vietnam-China News" published an editorial on December 30 titled "Another Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought." It said, the new brilliant achievements of the Chinese people demonstrate to the people of the world that as long as one grasps Mao Zedong Thought, this spiritual atomic bomb, one can have a material atomic bomb.

The editorial pointed out that China, in just one year, successfully conducted three nuclear tests. This is a great demonstration by the 700 million great Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, of the mighty power of Mao Zedong Thought to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. It is a great support to the revolutionary people of all countries.

The editorial emphasized that at a time when the American aggressors are making their dying struggles and escalating the war, China has successfully conducted another new nuclear test. This is a stern warning to the American imperialists' plot to launch new war adventures and is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people.
