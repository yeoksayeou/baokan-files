The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on January 4 strongly condemning the recent heinous crimes committed by the U.S. aggressor forces and South Korean henchmen in the massacre of people in Quang Ngai Province.

The statement, after denouncing the U.S. bandits and their lackeys for using methods more barbaric than Hitler's fascism to brutally slaughter nearly a thousand innocent residents of Tra Bong and Phuoc Son districts in Quang Ngai Province, emphasized that the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys mistakenly believe that their mass slaughter can subdue the people of South Vietnam and salvage their deteriorating situation there. In fact, no amount of barbarism can shake the iron will of the Vietnamese people to resist U.S. aggression and save their country.

The statement called on all peace-loving and justice-seeking people and governments around the world to severely condemn the extremely barbaric crimes committed daily by the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys in South Vietnam and to stop their blood-stained hands in time.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on January 7, the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and the Chinese Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity issued a joint statement today, strongly condemning the recent large-scale massacre of South Vietnamese civilians by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The statement said: From November 19 to December 6, 1966, the U.S. aggressors and their South Korean lackeys, under the command of Park Chung-hee, brutally slaughtered nearly a thousand South Vietnamese civilians in Tra Bong and Phuoc Son districts of Quang Ngai Province, mainly women and children. We once again sternly warn U.S. imperialism and its lackeys: Blood debts must be repaid in blood. All the evil deeds you have committed on Vietnamese soil will surely be punished.

The statement said that the new bloody crime committed by U.S. imperialism in the massacre of women and children in Quang Ngai Province will only make the Vietnamese people more resolute and brave in their fight, hastening the doom of U.S. imperialism. The Soviet revisionist leadership, which has always acted as a henchman of U.S. imperialism, will also reap what it has sown.

The statement also said: The Chinese people have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people in their struggle to the end against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway across China is the most fundamental preparation for supporting the Vietnamese people in their resistance against U.S. imperialism's expanding war of aggression. The 700 million Chinese people will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, standing forever with our Vietnamese brothers, fighting to the end against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

    我和委会与亚非团结会负责人指出美朴罪行必将受到惩罚
    新华社河内电　越南民主共和国外交部四日发表一项声明，强烈谴责美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军，最近大肆屠杀广义省人民的新的滔天罪行。
    声明在控诉了美国强盗及其走狗用比希特勒法西斯更为野蛮的手段，血腥屠杀广义省山晶县和平山县近千名无辜居民后强调指出，美帝国主义及其走狗以为它们大肆屠杀就可以使越南南方人民屈服，妄图挽救它们在越南南方的败局。其实，任何一种野蛮手段也不能动摇越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志。
    声明呼吁全世界爱好和平和主持正义的人民和政府，严厉谴责美国侵略者及其走狗每天在越南南方所犯下的极其野蛮的罪行，及时制止它们的血腥魔爪。
    据新华社七日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会负责人今天联合发表书面谈话，愤怒谴责美帝国主义及其走狗最近大规模屠杀越南南方和平居民的滔天罪行。
    这个谈话中说：从一九六六年十一月十九日到十二月六日，美国侵略者及其走狗南朝鲜朴正熙仆从军，在越南南方广义省的山晶县和平山县残暴地屠杀了越南南方和平居民近千人，其中主要是妇女儿童。我们再一次严厉警告美帝国主义及其走狗：血债要用血来还。你们在越南国土上犯下的一切罪恶，必将受到应有的惩罚！
    谈话中说，美帝国主义屠杀广义省妇女儿童的这一新的血腥罪行，只能促使越南人民更加坚强地英勇战斗，促进美帝国主义末日的到来。一贯充当美帝国主义帮凶的苏联修正主义领导集团，也必将自食其恶果。
    谈话还说：中国人民一贯遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争进行到底。中国人民正在全国进行的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命是支援越南人民反对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的最根本的战备。七亿中国人民将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远和兄弟的越南人民站在一起，为反对我们的共同敌人美帝国主义而奋斗到底。
