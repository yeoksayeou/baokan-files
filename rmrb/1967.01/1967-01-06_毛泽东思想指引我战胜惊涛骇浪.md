On August 29 last year, all the crew members of our ship, the 1018, fought bravely and tenaciously against the savage bombing by American air pirates. On an uninhabited island, we overcame numerous difficulties and returned triumphantly to the embrace of our motherland.

In this struggle, I did what I should have done and completed the tasks I should have completed. This is what Chairman Mao taught me to do. Without Mao Zedong Thought, we would not have been able to achieve victory in this struggle, and I personally would have accomplished nothing. I am the son of a poor peasant who grew up in bitterness. The Communist Party liberated me, and Mao Zedong Thought nurtured me into adulthood. Everything beneficial to the people that I have done should be attributed to our great leader Chairman Mao and to the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The First Revolution in My Soul

A few years ago, with the class sentiment of defending the Party, defending Chairman Mao, and defending the fruits of the revolution, I joined the People's Liberation Army and took up the glorious post of defending socialist motherland.

I was assigned to the navy to be a gunner. I was overjoyed. On the battlefield, I saw the shining big guns, touched them again and again, and wiped them again and again. I thought: If anyone dares to invade our great motherland's mountains and rivers, I will, together with my comrades, use the big guns given to us by the people of our motherland to blow them to smithereens! Under the guidance of this thought, I practiced my skills with great enthusiasm. I practiced during the day, at night, and even during rest time. However, I adopted a relaxed attitude towards studying politics and transforming my thoughts, thinking that since I was from a poor peasant background, I had deep bitterness and grievances, so it didn't matter if I studied a little less politics. In this way, bourgeois thoughts took advantage of the situation and grew unnoticed in my mind. I envied my comrades who studied engineering and drove cars, thinking that learning guns would be useless when I retired and returned home, even for hunting. Thus, my enthusiasm for learning guns gradually waned. The political commissar on the ship understood my thoughts and said to me: "Revolution is like a big machine, and everyone's work is like a screw on this big machine. Each screw plays a role in ensuring the normal operation of the machine." The commissar's words had a great impact on me. I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with my problems in mind. As soon as I opened the book, two lines of shining golden words appeared before my eyes: Chairman Mao said, "Our army is completely for the people, and it is thoroughly for the people's interests." I read these words of Chairman Mao over and over again, and the more I read, the more I felt Chairman Mao's words were warm and close to my heart; the more I compared, the more I felt my face burning. In this way, I used "In Memory of Norman Bethune" as a weapon to carry out a revolution in the depths of my soul. From then on, I loved the guns in my hands even more and no longer had any wandering thoughts.

From this incident, I deeply realized: A person's thoughts becoming red is not innate but is made red by Mao Zedong Thought. If one does not arm oneself and transform oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, even if one's background is good, one cannot resist the infiltration of bourgeois thoughts, and of course, one cannot become a conscious proletarian revolutionary fighter.

Pursuing and Eliminating Selfish Thoughts

A single rotten grain can spoil a whole pot of soup; a little selfishness can corrupt the entire soul. Through studying the "Three Articles," I realized that to thoroughly transform one's worldview, one must dare to break down selfishness and establish public spirit. Only by deeply exposing and fiercely fighting against bourgeois thoughts in one's mind can Mao Zedong Thought be deeply rooted, and the proletarian worldview be firmly established.

I suffer from severe seasickness and vomiting. Even a slight wave would make me sick and vomit. At first, I could still endure it, but later my thoughts began to waver, thinking: "If I continue like this for a few years, my body will be ruined." The old comrade-in-charge discovered my thoughts and said to me: "The road of revolution is very long, and the difficulties we will encounter will be much greater than seasickness and vomiting! If you are afraid of seasickness and vomiting, how will you be able to endure the risks of the revolution in the future?" Hearing the old comrade-in-charge's words, I thought and thought, and the more I thought, the more I felt that my fear of seasickness and vomiting was wrong. Just as I was unable to solve my knotty thoughts, Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated my heart like a lamp. Chairman Mao said, "Attack is the main means of annihilating the enemy." I thought about Chairman Mao's words over and over again and understood a truth: To annihilate the enemy in one's thoughts, one must first take the initiative to attack. Only by actively and proactively launching an attack on non-proletarian thoughts can one effectively preserve and expand the territory of proletarian thoughts in one's mind. Under the guidance of this thought, I first analyzed my thoughts of fearing seasickness and vomiting and not being content with my work on the ship, discovering that my main fear was of ruining my body. Fearing to ruin one's body is a philosophy of self-preservation, and its essence is bourgeois individualism. Finding the cause is finding the target of the attack.

Chairman Mao taught us: "All reactionary things, if you do not beat them, they will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor, the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." Afterwards, whether in big meetings or small meetings, or in heart-to-heart talks and mutual assistance, I bravely exposed my "old bottom" to the leaders and comrades, taking out this moldy thought to dry in the sun, and then using the perspective of the "Three Articles" to fiercely analyze and criticize it. I asked myself: "Comrades Zhang Side and Norman Bethune, and countless revolutionary martyrs, sacrificed their precious lives for the revolution, while I am afraid of ruining my body, what kind of thought is this?" I also asked myself: "Old Yu Gong was able to move two big mountains, can a warrior of the Mao Zedong era not be as good as Old Yu Gong? Still afraid of seasickness and vomiting?" My ideological understanding improved, and no matter how big the waves were, or how severe the seasickness and vomiting were, I was no longer afraid, and the thought of not being content with my work on the ship no longer existed.

Due to Mao Zedong Thought arming my mind, my class consciousness has been continuously improved. Later, I was initially rated as a five-star soldier and was honored to join the Communist Party of China.

Advancing Along the Course Opened by Chairman Mao

Last year, I was transferred from the army to work in a local unit and was assigned to the 1018 cargo ship as a sailor. The night before I left the unit, I studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" again. After studying, I made a decision: I must take Comrade Zhang Side as an example, and wherever the revolution needs me, I will rush to that place; no matter how the work changes, the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly cannot change. On the new battlefield, Chairman Mao's teachings, especially the "Three Articles," helped me pass new and more severe tests.

In the early morning of August 29, the aggressive American imperialists sent a large number of military aircraft to bombard and strafe us in shifts. The explosions were deafening, smoke billowed, and shrapnel flew everywhere. I am a person who has not been tested in war and have never heard the sound of bombs, let alone encountered such a crazy enemy. However, at this moment, I was not the least bit panicked, and my mind did not consider the issue of life and death. Chairman Mao's great voice echoed in every nerve of my body: American imperialism is a paper tiger, there is nothing to be afraid of! As long as we fight against it head-on, we will surely expose its paper tiger nature. Thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings, all the crew members calmly performed their duties and did not leave their battle stations for a single step. Everyone remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our Chinese nation has the spirit of fighting to the end with our enemies." We, whether lightly or heavily injured, did not let our work stop for a single second. Those in front fell, and those behind immediately took their place. After a bloody battle of three hours, the ship unfortunately took a hit and sank rapidly. To preserve revolutionary forces, we bid farewell to the martyrs' bodies and jumped into the sea one by one, swimming towards a small island more than ten thousand meters away.

This was an uninhabited island. One difficulty after another appeared before us. There was no food, no medicine, and the comrades' clothes were very thin, some even naked. The wounds of the injured worsened quickly after being soaked in seawater, and the seriously injured Captain Huang was unconscious all day. Comrades watched the sea day and night but did not see even half a ship's shadow. What to do? The only way was to swim across the ten-thousand-meter sea channel to establish contact with the Vietnamese people on the opposite large island. However, the situation at that time was very dangerous: each comrade was injured, and before landing on the island, we had already swum for six or seven hours. In addition, we had not eaten a single grain of rice for a day and a night, and our physical condition had significantly weakened; there were sharks in the sea; the sea currents were unpredictable, and if one was not careful, one would be swept out to the open sea; enemy planes followed and strafed us all day. Crossing the sea would involve such great risks, should I go or not? Chairman Mao taught: "The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." "To die for the people is to die a worthy death." I thought, at this critical moment, how can a Communist Party member not step forward! Being a good soldier of Chairman Mao, how can one care about personal safety! I immediately proposed to the party cell to swim across the sea.

At around 8 a.m. on the 30th, after the party cell's approval, I and Comrade Wang Xing put on life jackets, ate some wild fruits, and under the eager expectations of the comrades, dove into the sea. That day, the wind was strong and the waves were high. We were thrown onto the wave crests one moment and tossed into the whirlpools the next. After swimming a distance, the physically weaker Comrade Wang Xing gradually could not swim anymore. He said to me, "You go ahead first, let me drift by myself." I thought, we are all class brothers, to live together and to die together. So, I took off my life jacket and gave him the long strap on it to hold, and I pulled him forward. In this way, our progress was very slow. Seeing this situation, Comrade Wang repeatedly suggested that I go ahead first. At that time, I was very conflicted, but thinking of the safety of all comrades on the island, I encouraged him, "You must resolutely swim forward, if you really can't swim, retreat back to the island." Later, I pulled him for a while, seeing that there would be no more danger, I continued to swim forward by myself.

I was tossed around by the sea currents, and when it got dark, the wind and waves became even bigger. The waves beat me until I was exhausted, and every step forward required all my strength. Could I swim to the shore? A thought flashed in my mind: Forget it, let it drift. Just at this moment, I heard a voice that shook the sea: "This army has the spirit of advancing without fear of sacrifice, of daring to fight and daring to win, and of persevering in prolonged struggle—it is an army that presses on bravely and advances wave upon wave though sacrificed in bloody battle. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation is, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight." Chairman Mao's words instantly made my blood boil and gave me boundless strength. Chairman Mao, at the age of seventy-three, still swam in the Yangtze River, what a great spirit! Thinking of Chairman Mao, a red sun rose in my heart, and in the pitch-black sea, a golden path appeared before my eyes. At this moment, I felt full of energy and made the greatest resolve: I must advance along the revolutionary path opened by Chairman Mao, and I will not rest until I achieve my goal!

After more than thirteen hours of struggle, at around 9 p.m., I finally reached the large island. As soon as I stepped onto the shore, I felt dizzy and heavy-headed, and I fainted. In my faintness, I seemed to hear Chairman Mao's affectionate voice: "Carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and fighting continuously." Chairman Mao's teachings gave me the greatest strength. I crawled up from the shore, shaky and unsteady, and walked towards the shore. The next morning, I finally found the Vietnamese people on the island. When I took the hot porridge handed to me by the Vietnamese brothers with both hands, tears of excitement welled up in my eyes, and countless words surged in my heart: Chairman Mao! In this ten-thousand-meter swim, you appeared before me countless times, and I heard your voice countless times. It is you who gave me boundless strength. I will forever be loyal to you and forever advance bravely along the revolutionary path you opened! Even if the sky collapses and the earth shatters, my heart will not waver!

For the sake of helping my class brothers out of the predicament on the island, Liang Huabao (right) and Wang Xing, disregarding personal safety, undertook the task of swimming to establish contact. Liang Huabao struggled in the sea for more than thirteen hours, covering a distance of more than ten thousand meters, and successfully completed the mission.

    毛泽东思想指引我战胜惊涛骇浪
    “南海英雄船”英雄水手　梁华保
    去年八月二十九日，我们一○一八号货船的全体船员，在美国空中强盗的狂轰滥炸下，英勇搏斗，顽强不屈；在没有人烟的荒岛上，我们又战胜了重重困难，胜利地回到祖国的怀抱。
    在这次斗争中，我做了一点自己应该做的工作，完成了自己应该完成的任务。这是毛主席教导我这样做的。如果离开了毛泽东思想，我们就不可能在这次斗争中取得胜利，我自己更是什么也做不成。我是一个在苦水里泡大的贫农的儿子，共产党解放了我，毛泽东思想哺育我长大成人，我所做的一切有益于人民的事情，都应该归功于我们伟大的领袖毛主席，归功于伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    灵魂深处的第一次革命
    几年前，我带着保卫党、保卫毛主席、保卫革命胜利果实的阶级感情，参加了人民解放军，走上了保卫社会主义祖国的光荣岗位。
    我被分配到海军舰艇上当了枪炮兵，心里真是欢喜极了。在战位上，我看到发光的大炮，摸了又摸，擦了又擦。心想：要是谁敢侵犯我们伟大祖国的河山，我就要和战友们一道，用祖国人民交给我们的大炮，把他们轰个稀巴烂！在这种思想的支配下，我练技术的劲头可大啦。白天练，黑夜练，休息时间也练，但对学习政治，改造思想却采取了放松的态度。以为自己是贫农出身，苦大仇深，少学点政治没关系。这样，资产阶级思想就乘虚而入，头脑里不知不觉地滋长了个人主义思想。羡慕学轮机、开汽车的同志。觉得学了枪炮将来退伍回家连打猎都用不上，于是，我学枪炮的劲头慢慢地松下来。舰上政委摸透了我思想上的病，就开导我说：“革命就是一盘大机器，每个人的工作就像这盘大机器上的一颗螺丝钉，每颗螺丝钉都起着保证机器正常运转的作用。”领导上的这番话，使我受到很大震动。我带着自己的问题学习了《为人民服务》。书一打开，两行金光闪闪的字就出现在眼前，毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”我把毛主席这段话反复读了好几遍，边读边对照自己，越读越感到毛主席的话亲切；越对照越感到脸上发烧。就这样，我用《为人民服务》这篇文章作武器，在自己灵魂深处闹起了革命。从此以后，我更加热爱手中的枪炮，再也不见异思迁了。
    我从这件事情中深刻地认识到：一个人的思想红，不是天生的，而是毛泽东思想照红的。如果不是用毛泽东思想武装自己，改造自己，即使出身好，也经不起资产阶级思想的侵蚀，当然也不可能成为自觉的无产阶级革命战士。
    穷追猛打私心杂念
    一粒老鼠屎，能把一锅汤搞脏；一分私心，能把整个灵魂腐蚀。通过学习“老三篇”，我体会到，要彻底改造世界观，必须敢字当头，大破私字，大立公字。只有对头脑里的资产阶级思想揭得深、斗得狠，毛泽东思想才扎得深，无产阶级世界观才树得牢。
    我晕船呕吐比较厉害，稍有一点风浪，就晕就吐。开始，我还能坚持得住，后来思想逐渐波动起来，心想：“这样折腾几年，身体不就垮了吗？”老班长发现我有这种活思想，就对我说：革命的路程还很长很长啊，将要遇到的困难不知要比晕船呕吐大多少倍！连晕船呕吐都怕起来，今后怎么经得住革命的风险呢？听了老班长的这番话，我想了又想，越想越觉得自己怕晕船呕吐的思想不对头。正当我解不开思想疙瘩的时候，毛主席的教导像明灯一样照亮了我的心。毛主席说：“进攻，是消灭敌人的主要手段”，我把毛主席这段话想了又想，明白了这样一个道理：要想消灭思想上的敌人，首先必须采取积极的进攻，只有积极主动地向非无产阶级思想发起进攻，才能有效地保存和扩大头脑中无产阶级思想的地盘。在这个思想的指导下，我首先对自己怕晕船怕呕吐、不安心船上工作的思想作了分析，发现自己主要是怕把身体搞垮。怕把身体搞垮，这是保命哲学，它的实质是资产阶级个人主义思想。找到了原因就找到了进攻的目标。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒，这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”以后，不论大会小会，也不论是谈心互助，我都勇敢地向领导和同志们狠揭自己的“老底”，把这个发霉的思想端出来晒太阳，然后用“老三篇”的观点，狠狠地进行分析批判。我问自己：“张思德、白求恩同志和千千万万的革命先烈，为了革命，献出了宝贵的生命，而自己却怕把身体搞垮，这是什么思想啊？”我还问自己：“老愚公能把两座大山搬掉了，难道一个毛泽东时代的战士，还不如老愚公？还怕晕船呕吐？”思想认识提高了，风浪再大，晕船呕吐再厉害，我也不怕了，不安心船上工作的思想再也不存在了。
    由于毛泽东思想武装了头脑，我的阶级觉悟得到了不断的提高。以后被初评为五好战士，并且光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    沿着毛主席开辟的航道前进
    去年我从部队转业到地方工作，被分配到一○一八号货船当水手。离队前的那天晚上，我又一次学习了《为人民服务》。学完后我下了决心：一定要以张思德同志为榜样，革命需要我到哪里，我就奔向哪里；不管工作怎么变，完全彻底为人民服务的思想不能变。在新的战斗岗位上，毛主席的教导，特别是“老三篇”帮助我经受了新的更加严峻的考验。
    八月二十九日凌晨，侵略成性的美帝国主义派出大批军用飞机，向我们进行轮番轰炸扫射。爆炸声震耳欲聋，硝烟滚滚，弹片横飞。我是一个没有经过战争考验的人，从来没有听见过炸弹的声音，更没有遇到过这样疯狂的敌人。但是，这时却一点也不心慌，脑子里根本没有考虑到生死问题。毛主席的伟大声音震荡着我的每一条神经：美帝国主义是个纸老虎，没有什么可怕的！只要和它进行针锋相对的斗争，就一定会戳穿它纸老虎的原形。想到毛主席的教导，我们全体船员沉着地履行自己的职责，一步也没有离开战斗岗位。大家牢记着毛主席的教导：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概。”我们不管是轻伤重伤，都没有让自己的工作有一分一秒的停歇。前头的倒下了，后头的紧接着上来。血战三个小时，船身不幸中弹，急剧下沉。为了保存革命力量，我们告别了烈士的遗体，一个接着一个跳下海去，向着一万多米以外的海岛游去。
    这是一个没有人烟的荒岛。重重的困难，一个接着一个地出现在我们面前。没有粮食，没有药物，同志们穿的衣服都很单薄，有的还光着身子。伤员的伤口经过海水泡浸，很快地恶化了，身负重伤的黄船长终日昏迷不醒。同志们日夜对着大海了望，却连半只船影都没有发现。怎么办？唯一的办法就是泅渡万米海峡，去和对面大岛上的越南人民取得联系。但是，当时情况十分艰险：我们每个同志都带着伤，上岛之前已经游了六七个小时。加上一天一夜粒米未进，体质显著减弱；海里有鲨鱼；海流旋转不定，一不小心，就会把人卷到外海去；敌机整日在海上跟踪、扫射。渡海要冒这样大的风险，我去不去呢？毛主席教导说：“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”“为人民而死，就是死得其所。”我想，在这紧要关头，是共产党员那能不挺身而出！做毛主席的好战士，岂能管个人安危！我马上向党小组提出泅渡大海的要求。
    三十日上午八点钟左右，经过党小组的批准，我和王星同志穿上救生衣，吃了一些野果，在同志们的殷切期望下，向大海扑去。这天风急浪大，我们一下子被抛到浪峰上，一下子又被摔进浪涡里，游了一段，体力较差的王星同志慢慢游不动了。他对我说：“你先游吧，让我自己慢慢漂。”我想，我们都是阶级兄弟，生要生在一起，死要死在一块。于是我把身上的救生衣解开来，把上面的一条长带子递给王星拉着，自己带着他前进。这样，前进的速度很慢。小王看到这种情况，再三提出要我先游。当时我心里非常矛盾，但想到岛上全体同志的生命安全，就鼓励他说：“你一定要坚决向前游，实在游不到，就退回荒岛。”后来，我带他游了一会，看到再不会有什么危险了，自己才继续向前游去。
    我随着海流东回西转，天黑了，风浪越来越大，海浪把我摔打得筋疲力尽，每前进一步都要使出全身的力气。我能游到对岸吗？脑子里闪现出一个念头：算了，让它漂吧。就在这时候，我耳边响起了一种震撼大海的声音：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”毛主席的话，顿时使我热血沸腾，增添了无穷的力量。毛主席啊，您老人家七十三岁高龄，还畅游长江，这是多么伟大的气魄！想起毛主席，我心中升起了红太阳，在黑漆的大海里，眼前出现了一条金光闪闪的航道。这时，我感到浑身是劲，下定最大决心，一定要沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道前进，不达目的，决不罢休！
    经过十三个多小时的搏斗，晚上九点多钟，终于到达了大岛。刚踏上海滩，我觉得天旋地转，头重脚轻，一下子昏倒过去了。昏迷中，我好像又听到了毛主席亲切的声音：发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风。毛主席的教导又给了我最大的力量。我从海滩上爬起来，摇摇晃晃，向岸上走去。第二天一早，终于在岛上找到了越南人民。当我双手接过越南兄弟送上的一碗热粥的时候，激动的热泪夺眶而出，千言万语涌上心头：毛主席啊！在这一万多米的游程里，您多少次出现在我面前，我多少次听到您的声音，是您给了我无穷的力量。我要永远忠于您，永远沿着您开辟的革命航道奋勇前进！天崩地裂不动摇，海枯石烂不变心！
