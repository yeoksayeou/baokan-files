New China News Agency, January 14th: Over 10,000 officers and soldiers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces held a rally this afternoon in the grand and magnificent Great Hall of the People to warmly welcome Bekir Balluku, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense, and Xito Chako, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, along with the military delegation they led.

Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, including Kang Sheng, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and members of the National Defense Council, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, and Ye Jianying, as well as Xiao Hua, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yang Chengwu, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Wang Shusheng, Vice Minister of National Defense, attended the meeting.

Today, the Great Hall of the People was filled with excitement. The stage was adorned with the national flags of both countries. Inside the hall, there were large banners written in both Chinese and Albanian: "Salute to the heroic Albanian people!" "Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania!" At around 3 PM, Balluku, Chako, and other Albanian comrades, accompanied by Kang Sheng and Chen Yi, ascended the stage. The entire audience stood up, applauding enthusiastically, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and paying tribute to the Albanian comrades from the front lines of the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist struggle. Kang Sheng and Chen Yi shook hands with Balluku and others, once again expressing the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania.

Ye Jianying spoke at the welcoming rally. On behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Lin Biao and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he extended the warmest welcome to the honorable envoys from the heroic people and army on the front lines of the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist struggle. He said, the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha is a party that holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and enjoys high prestige in the international communist movement. The beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a seasoned and outstanding Marxist-Leninist. The Albanian people are a heroic people who stand tall and firm. The People's Republic of Albania is a great socialist country. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Heroic Albania is a great beacon of socialism in Europe. The Soviet revisionist leadership, the Yugoslav Tito clique, all kinds of traitors and renegade cliques, compared to you, they are but a handful of dust, while you are a towering mountain. They are slaves and henchmen who kneel before imperialism, while you are fearless proletarian revolutionaries who dare to fight against imperialism and its running dogs, daring to fight against all enemies of the world."

Ye Jianying enthusiastically praised the Albanian Labor Party for upholding the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, insisting on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, emphasizing proletarian politics, and implementing a series of revolutionary measures. He said, these measures are another brilliant example of the Albanian Labor Party's creative application of the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism to their specific practices, and a great contribution to the international proletarian revolutionary cause.

He said, the recent Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party is a major historical event in the political life of the Albanian people. This congress, guided by the principle of class struggle, proposed important tasks for further advancing the ideological and cultural revolution. Comrade Hoxha pointed out at the congress: "As long as the socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural sphere is not completely victorious, the victories of the socialist revolution in the political and economic spheres will not be guaranteed." Comrade Hoxha also pointed out, "Whether or not to acknowledge class struggle in socialist society is a fundamental issue, a dividing line between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists, between revolutionaries and traitors to the revolution." Comrade Hoxha's correct judgment on this issue of great theoretical and practical significance has pointed out a brilliant path for the Albanian people to further advance the socialist revolution.

Ye Jianying warmly praised the Albanian People's Army as a heroic army that has always been steadfast in its loyalty to the Party, the people, and the revolution, and has been tempered by war. He said, the Albanian People's Army stands vigilantly on the battlefront, continually striking back against the subversive, disruptive activities and military provocations of American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Yugoslav Tito renegade clique, making great contributions to the defense of socialist Albania's security and the defense of peace in Europe and the world.

He said, the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Hoxha, issued a great call to the people's army last spring: "Definitely put political work in the first place," requiring the people's army to be built into a force that, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, is both a fighting force, a work force, and a production force. The officers and soldiers of the people's army have turned Comrade Hoxha's great call into action, launching a vigorous revolutionary movement throughout the army, creating a scene of revolutionary fervor.

Ye Jianying said, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is proud and honored to have the heroic revolutionary army of the Albanian people as its close comrade-in-arms. Our two armies are truly people's armies, revolutionary armies. We will support and learn from each other in our common struggle.

Ye Jianying, in discussing the great historical significance of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, has pushed our socialist revolution to a broader and deeper new stage, opening a new era in the history of the international communist movement. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is a comprehensive confrontation between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and their agents within our Party, the greatest, most extensive, and most profound revolution in history. Through fierce class struggle, the Cultural Revolution has begun to achieve great victories. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been further grasped by the broad masses and combined with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, unleashing an invincible power. The strongholds of the bourgeois reactionary line have been one by one taken over. New things emerging from the Cultural Revolution—Red Guards—have, under Chairman Mao's firm and enthusiastic support, rapidly grown into a formidable army of cultural revolution. The revolutionary movements of workers, peasants, students, and various sectors in the cultural sphere and party and government organs are uniting to launch a comprehensive offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line. The great tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping away the mud and dirt left over from the old society. A small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and a few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line are surrounded by the revolutionary masses and beginning to collapse.

He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to uphold Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new level. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party and the entire country. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, the great, invincible, and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is more widely spread and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Our country's political life, social appearance, and people's spiritual state have undergone earth-shaking changes. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our people have responded to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote production, turning great spiritual power into great material power, achieving great victories on all fronts of socialist construction.

Ye Jianying said, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a people's army created and nurtured by Chairman Mao. Our army is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, has called on us to never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao has issued a directive of great strategic significance to emphasize proletarian politics. All officers and soldiers of our army have enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and striving to make our army a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our army's officers and soldiers, with a high sense of political responsibility and great revolutionary enthusiasm, have actively participated in and resolutely defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. Our army, riding the wind of the Cultural Revolution, has raised the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. We will definitely, together with the people of the entire country, carry the socialist revolution in our country to the end. We will definitely, together with the Albanian people, resolutely support the revolutionary people of the world in carrying the world revolution to the end, building a red world without imperialism, capitalism, and exploitation.

Ye Jianying said, regarding the current favorable situation of the world revolution, Vietnam is the focal point of the anti-American struggle of the people of the world. The Vietnamese people have unleashed the mighty power of people's war, growing stronger and stronger in the fight, creating a great revolutionary situation in Vietnam. American imperialism is suffering more and more defeats, facing the fate of final defeat. The Chinese people are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices to support the Vietnamese people in fighting the Americans to the end. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is fully prepared. As soon as the situation requires, as soon as the Vietnamese people demand, as soon as our great commander Chairman Mao gives the order, we will rush to the front lines of aiding Vietnam and fighting the Americans, fighting side by side with the Vietnamese people to annihilate the American aggressors.

Ye Jianying said, American imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist leadership are colluding globally to save the last moments of the capitalist system. American imperialism is madly opposing China, using every means to contain, isolate, and encircle China. Soviet modern revisionism, in line with the needs of American imperialism, is madly opposing the Communist Party of China, the Albanian Labor Party, and other Marxist-Leninist brother parties, madly attacking China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hastening the plotting of a great gathering of traitors and renegades, hastening the formation of a counter-revolutionary alliance against China, against communism, and against the people, attempting to help American imperialism extinguish the blazing flames of the world people's revolution. The Soviet modern revisionist leadership, betraying the will of the Soviet people, following American imperialism step by step, is also heavily engaged in strategic eastward shift, deploying troops, and intensifying military deployments against our country. We warn American imperialism and its accomplices that if you insist on imposing war on the Chinese people and the people of the world, awaiting you will definitely be your doom, definitely the great liberation and great turnaround of the people of the world. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely, together with the Albanian people and the people of the world, unite and fight together, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminating American imperialism and all its accomplices and running dogs from this earth.

Ye Jianying finally enthusiastically praised the unbreakable genuine revolutionary friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania. He said, for our common great ideal—the victory of the international communist cause, the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will forever fight side by side with the brotherly Albanian people and the people's army, advancing together.

Balluku spoke amidst enthusiastic applause. He enthusiastically praised the unbreakable fighting friendship between the two parties and the peoples of Albania and China. He said, our friendship is a great, eternal, and deep friendship. Our friendship is the fighting friendship between peoples who stand on the revolutionary front, a friendship based on the immortal Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. This friendship is created by our two heroic parties and our great leaders Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha. Our party and people's leader Comrade Enver Hoxha said: "The Albanian Labor Party believes that the unity with People's China, the defense of People's China, and the opposition to the imperialists and their running dogs, the modern revisionists led by Khrushchev, are a matter of life and death for all revolutionary and freedom-loving forces and peoples in the world."

Balluku said, we are especially pleased that our beloved friend Comrade Mao Zedong, in his congratulatory message to our Party's Fifth Congress, spoke such wise, affectionate, and inspiring words: "Though far apart, we are as close as neighbors," "We and you are not those false friends with honeyed words and poisonous hearts, not those two-faced people. Our revolutionary fighting friendship has withstood the test of stormy winds and rains." These words will be forever engraved in the minds and hearts of the Albanian people and communists.

Balluku highly evaluated the profound influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao on China's socialist construction and the development of the world revolutionary movement. He said, the Albanian Labor Party and people welcome China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, regarding it as a new and valuable contribution to socialist theory and practice. The great historical victories of brotherly China's socialism are a great school for the broad laboring masses, especially the younger generation, to undergo revolutionary tempering.

He said, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made the Khrushchev revisionists furious. They have colluded with American imperialism, concentrating all their firepower to oppose China, the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong, and to oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, the Soviet revisionists and their followers will never achieve their counter-revolutionary goals. The Soviet revisionists' deep hatred for the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong clearly shows that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has destroyed their base in China and exposed their ideological allies. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will sweep away the reactionary bourgeois culture and ideology of the exploiting classes, purify, develop, and consolidate the new proletarian culture serving socialism and communism. Tens of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals armed with Mao Zedong Thought have launched a conscious and powerful revolutionary movement. This movement has immeasurable historical significance for the great future of socialist and communist China.

Balluku said, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has inspired the people of the world, further strengthening the struggle against imperialism, especially American imperialism, and further strengthening the struggle against revisionism, especially the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Balluku said, the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, has further developed and enriched the theory of Marxism-Leninism and scientific socialism.

Balluku praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army for, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, following Chairman Mao's teachings, loyally serving the people and the revolution, and being closely connected with the people.

Balluku also said, Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on people's war are a further development of Marxism-Leninism. He said, the Khrushchev revisionists, serving American imperialism, have vainly tried to destroy and eliminate the new high tide of world revolution. They, for the sake of so-called peaceful coexistence and Sino-American cooperation to dominate the world, openly oppose people's war. But it is impossible to stop the progress of society. The people of the world will definitely overthrow American imperialism, overthrow Soviet revisionism and all reactionaries.

Balluku said, imperialism and revisionism are conspiring to form a holy alliance to destroy Marxist-Leninist parties, eliminate the victory of socialism, and first target the Albanian and Chinese parties and peoples who stand firmly on the anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist position. But we will never relax our revolutionary vigilance. The People's Republic of China is becoming stronger and stronger, and your country has become the center and main, impregnable fortress of socialism and the world revolution.

Balluku strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists' conspiracy with American aggressors, trying to bring the Vietnamese issue into their anti-China scheme. He emphasized that there can be no compromise, cooperation, or unity with revisionism, but only a thorough break and a resolute, principled struggle until they are completely bankrupt.

He said, the Soviet renegade leadership's so-called new conference of parties will only further expose themselves to the Soviet people and the working people of the world as the greatest splitters of the international communist movement and the sworn enemies of the people of all countries fighting against imperialism for freedom and rights.

Balluku also spoke about the series of revolutionary measures taken by the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha in recent years, and the great victories achieved by the Albanian people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said, the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party held last November has great historical significance in the life of the Albanian people. The resolutions of the Fifth Congress have been enthusiastically supported by our people and are being firmly implemented.

After Balluku finished his speech amidst thunderous applause, he, on behalf of the Albanian People's Army, presented a banner to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which read: "Greetings to the comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!" Ye Jianying, on behalf of Comrade Lin Biao and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, accepted the banner.

At this moment, Comrade Kang Sheng led everyone to shout: "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Comrade Balluku also shouted in Chinese: "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!"

Finally, Comrade Xiao Hua led the entire audience of over 10,000 people to read aloud a passage from Chairman Mao's congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party: "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together."

Attending today's meeting were responsible comrades from various relevant departments: Peng Shaohui, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Yuan Ziqin, Qiao Guanhua, Chu Tuonan, Chen Shipan, Wu Kehua, Zhang Xianye, Tan Jiaxu, Zhao Qimin, Wu Shien, Liu Shaowen, Jiang Wen, Lu Yang, Li Zhen, Pan Zhenwu, Xu Wenlie, Wang De, Cao Cheng, Yuan Huabing, Lan Qiao, Lin Bin, Li Zhongqi, etc.

The Albanian Ambassador to China, Vasili Natanaeli, also attended the meeting.

    新华社十四日讯　中国人民解放军陆海空三军指战员一万多人，今天下午在雄伟壮丽的人民大会堂举行大会，热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科和由他们率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团。
    中共中央政治局常委、人大常委会副委员长康生，中共中央政治局委员、国防委员会副主席陈毅、刘伯承、徐向前、聂荣臻、叶剑英，中共中央委员、中国人民解放军总政治部主任萧华，中共中央候补委员、中国人民解放军代总参谋长杨成武，中共中央委员、国防部副部长王树声等出席了大会。
    今天，人民大会堂大礼堂热气腾腾。主席台上挂着中阿两国国旗，大礼堂内，挂着用中阿两国文字写成的巨幅标语：“向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致敬！”“中阿两国人民和军队之间的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！”下午三时许，巴卢库、恰科等阿尔巴尼亚同志由康生同志、陈毅同志等陪同登上主席台，全场指战员起立，热烈鼓掌，挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，向来自反帝反修最前线的阿尔巴尼亚战友致敬。康生、陈毅等同志同巴卢库等同志紧紧地手拉着手，再一次表达了中阿两国人民和军队之间牢不可破的战斗友谊。
    叶剑英同志在欢迎大会上讲话。他代表我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志、中国人民解放军全体指战员，向来自反帝反修最前线的英雄人民和英雄军队的光荣使者，表示最热烈的欢迎。他说，以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，是高举马克思列宁主义旗帜、在国际共产主义运动中享有崇高威望的党。阿尔巴尼亚人民的敬爱领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，是久经考验的、杰出的马克思列宁主义者。阿尔巴尼亚人民，是顶天立地的英雄的人民。阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，是伟大的社会主义国家。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，是欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。“苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起你们来，他们都不过是一抔黄土，而你们是耸入云霄的高山。他们是跪倒在帝国主义面前的奴仆和爪牙，你们是敢于同帝国主义及其走狗战斗、敢于同世界上一切暴敌战斗的大无畏的无产阶级革命家。”
    叶剑英同志热情赞颂阿尔巴尼亚劳动党发扬不断革命、彻底革命的精神，坚持无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，突出无产阶级政治，采取的一系列革命化措施。他说，这些措施，是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党创造性地把马克思列宁主义普遍真理同本国具体实践相结合的又一个光辉范例，是对国际无产阶级革命事业的卓越贡献。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党不久前召开的第五次代表大会，是阿尔巴尼亚人民政治生活中具有重大历史意义的事件。这次大会，贯串着一条阶级斗争的红线，提出了进一步开展思想文化革命的重要任务。霍查同志在会上指出：“只要思想文化领域里的社会主义革命不获全胜，那么，政治和经济领域里的社会主义革命胜利也就没有保证。”霍查同志又指出，“承认还是不承认社会主义社会的阶级斗争，是一个原则问题，是马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者、革命者和革命的叛徒之间的分界线。”霍查同志对于这个具有重大理论意义和现实意义的问题的正确论断，为阿尔巴尼亚人民进一步开展社会主义革命，指出了光辉的道路。
    叶剑英同志热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民军是始终不渝地忠于党、忠于人民、忠于革命的一支久经战争考验的、英勇善战的英雄军队。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军警惕地站在战斗岗位上，不断给予美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、南斯拉夫铁托叛徒集团的颠覆破坏活动和军事挑衅，以有力的打击，为保卫社会主义阿尔巴尼亚的安全，为保卫欧洲和世界和平，作出了巨大的贡献。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖霍查同志，在去年春天向人民军发出了伟大的号召：一定要“把政治工作摆在首位”，要求“人民军要建设成为一支像毛泽东同志所说的那样，既是战斗队又是工作队和生产队”的军队。人民军的干部和战士，把霍查同志的这一伟大号召，化为自己的实际行动，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的革命化群众运动，全军上下呈现出一片热气腾腾的革命景象。
    叶剑英同志说，中国人民解放军以有阿尔巴尼亚人民军这样一支英雄的革命军队作为自己的亲密战友，感到无比高兴，无比自豪！我们两国军队都是真正的人民的军队，革命的军队。我们要在共同的斗争中互相支持，互相学习。
    叶剑英同志在谈到当前我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史意义时说，我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席亲自发动、亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把我国社会主义革命推进到一个更广阔、更深入的新阶段，在国际共产主义运动的历史上开辟了一个新纪元。我国这次无产阶级文化大革命，是无产阶级同资产阶级和它在我们党内的代理人的一次全面的较量，是历史上最伟大、最广泛、最深刻的革命。经过激烈的阶级斗争，文化大革命开始取得了伟大的胜利。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线进一步为广大群众所掌握，同广大群众的革命热情相结合，发挥了无比强大的威力，资产阶级反动路线盘踞的顽固堡垒一个个被夺取过来。文化大革命中涌现的新事物——红卫兵，在毛主席坚决的热烈的支持下，迅速成长为一支惊天动地的文化革命大军。革命的工人运动，农民运动，学生运动，文化领域各界和党政机关的革命群众运动，正在联合起来，向资产阶级反动路线展开了全面的总攻击。伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，正荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，陷于革命群众的重重包围之中，开始全线崩溃。
    他说，无产阶级文化大革命，是大立毛泽东思想的伟大革命。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是全党全国一切工作的指导方针。随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，伟大的、战无不胜的、光芒万丈的毛泽东思想，空前普及，空前深入人心。我们国家的政治生活、社会面貌、人们的精神状态，发生了翻天覆地的大变化。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我国人民响应毛主席的号召，抓革命，促生产，把伟大的精神力量，变成伟大的物质力量，在社会主义建设的各条战线上取得了巨大的胜利。
    叶剑英同志说，中国人民解放军，是毛主席亲手缔造和培育的人民军队。我军永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志号召我们，要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。林彪同志作出了突出无产阶级政治这个具有伟大战略意义的指示。我军全体指战员热烈响应林彪同志的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，努力把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校。在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，我军干部战士以高度的政治责任感和极大的革命热情，积极参加和坚决保卫无产阶级文化大革命，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。我军乘文化大革命的东风，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，提高到了一个新的阶段。我们一定要同全国人民一道，把我国社会主义革命进行到底。我们一定要同阿尔巴尼亚人民一道，坚决支援全世界革命人民把世界革命进行到底，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的红彤彤的新世界。
    叶剑英同志在谈到当前世界革命一片大好形势以后说，越南是当前全世界人民反美斗争的焦点。越南人民发挥人民战争的强大威力，越战越强，打出了越南的大好革命形势。美帝国主义越败越惨，面临着最后失败的命运。中国人民决心不惜作出最大的民族牺牲，支持越南人民抗美到底。中国人民解放军已经作好了一切准备。只要形势需要，只要越南人民要求，只要我们的伟大统帅毛主席一声令下，我们就奔赴援越抗美的最前线，同越南人民并肩作战，彻底消灭美国侵略者。
    叶剑英同志说，美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义领导集团，为了挽救资本主义制度的最后灭亡，正在进行全球性的大勾结。美帝国主义疯狂反对中国，千方百计企图遏制中国，孤立中国，包围中国。苏联现代修正主义适应美帝国主义的需要，疯狂地反对中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和其他马克思列宁主义兄弟党，疯狂地攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命，加紧策划叛徒工贼的大集会，加紧拼凑反华、反共、反人民的反革命同盟，妄图帮助美帝国主义扑灭世界人民革命的熊熊烈火。苏联现代修正主义领导集团，违背苏联人民的意志，和美帝国主义亦步亦趋，也在大搞战略重点东移，调兵遣将，加紧针对我国的军事部署。我们要警告美帝国主义及其帮凶，如果你们硬要把战争强加到中国人民和世界人民头上，等待着你们的，肯定是你们的灭亡，肯定是世界人民的大解放、大翻身。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，决心同阿尔巴尼亚人民，同全世界人民团结一致，共同战斗，把美帝国主义和它的形形色色的帮凶走狗，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地从这个地球上扫除掉。
    叶剑英同志最后热情赞扬中、阿两国人民和军队之间的牢不可破的真正的革命友谊。他说，为了我们共同的伟大理想——国际共产主义事业的胜利，中国人民和人民解放军将永远同兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军共同战斗，携手前进。
    巴卢库同志在热烈的掌声中讲话。他热情洋溢地赞颂了阿中两党和两国人民的牢不可破的战斗的友谊。他说，我们的友谊是伟大的、永恒的、深厚的友谊。我们的友谊是坚持革命阵地的人民之间的战斗友谊，是建立在不朽的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义思想基础上的友谊。这种友谊是我们两个英雄的党和我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志所缔造的。我们党和人民领袖恩维尔·霍查同志说：“阿尔巴尼亚劳动党认为，同人民中国的团结，保卫人民中国、反对帝国主义者及其走狗赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者对她的恶毒攻击，对世界上一切革命的、爱好自由的力量和人民来说，是一个切身的问题。”
    巴卢库同志说，我们感到特别高兴的是，我们敬爱的朋友毛泽东同志在给我们党的第五次代表大会的贺电中，讲出了如此英明、如此亲切和令人鼓舞的话：“海内存知己，天涯若比邻”，“我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”这番话将铭记在阿尔巴尼亚人民和共产党人的脑海里和心坎上，永志不忘。
    巴卢库同志高度评价了在伟大的毛主席领导下的无产阶级文化大革命对中国的社会主义建设和世界革命运动的发展的深刻影响。他说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民欢迎中国的无产阶级文化大革命，把它看作是对社会主义理论和实践的新的宝贵贡献。兄弟的中国社会主义的具有历史性的伟大胜利，是对广大劳动群众特别是年青一代进行革命锻炼的大学校。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，使赫鲁晓夫修正主义者感到恼火，他们同美帝国主义勾结，集中一切火力，反对中国、中国共产党和毛泽东同志，反对无产阶级文化大革命。他说，苏联修正主义者及其追随者是绝不能达到他们反革命的目的的。苏联修正主义者对中国共产党和毛泽东同志的刻骨仇恨，清楚地证明了中国的无产阶级文化大革命摧毁了他们在中国所依靠的基础，揭露了他们思想上的盟友。无产阶级文化大革命将扫除剥削阶级的反动的资产阶级的文化和思想，纯洁、发展和巩固为社会主义、共产主义服务的无产阶级新文化。用毛泽东思想武装起来的千百万工农兵、革命知识分子掀起了一场自觉而强大的革命运动，这个运动对伟大的人民中国的社会主义和共产主义前途，有着不可估量的历史性意义。
    巴卢库同志说，中国无产阶级文化大革命鼓舞着全世界人民，进一步加强反对帝国主义、首先是反对美帝国主义的斗争，进一步加强反对修正主义、特别是反对苏联修正主义领导集团的斗争。
    巴卢库同志说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志进一步发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义和科学社会主义的理论。
    巴卢库赞扬中国人民解放军在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，遵循毛主席的教导，忠诚地为人民为革命服务，和人民血肉相连。
    巴卢库同志还说，毛泽东同志关于人民战争的思想是马克思列宁主义的进一步发展。他说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者，为美帝国主义效劳，枉费心机，企图破坏和消灭世界革命新高潮。他们为了所谓和平共处和苏美合作主宰世界，而公开地反对人民战争。但要想阻挡住社会的前进是不可能的，世界人民一定要打倒美帝国主义，打倒苏联修正主义和一切反动派。
    巴卢库同志说，帝国主义和修正主义正在阴谋组织神圣同盟，来破坏马克思列宁主义政党，消除社会主义的胜利，并且把打击的目标首先指向坚决站在反帝反修立场上的阿中两党和两国人民。但是我们永远也不会放松革命警惕。中华人民共和国日益强大，你们的国家已经成为社会主义和世界革命的中心和主要的、不可攻克的堡垒。
    巴卢库同志强烈谴责苏联修正主义与美国侵略者合谋，竭力把越南问题纳入苏美反对社会主义中国的阴谋勾当中去。他强调指出，同修正主义根本不能讲和、合作和团结，而只有彻底同他们决裂、同他们进行坚决的、原则的斗争，一直到他们最后完全破产为止。
    他说，苏共叛徒领导搞所谓的各个党的新的会议，在苏联人民面前，世界劳动人民面前，就会更加暴露他们自己是国际共产主义运动的最大的分裂者，是各国人民反对帝国主义、为争取自由和权利而斗争的不共戴天的敌人。
    巴卢库同志还谈到以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党近年来所采取的一系列革命化措施，以及阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的巨大胜利。他说，去年十一月召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会，在阿尔巴尼亚人民的生活中，有着伟大的历史意义，五大的决议，受到我国人民的极热烈的拥护，并且坚定不移地贯彻着。
    巴卢库同志在暴风雨般的掌声中结束讲话以后，代表阿尔巴尼亚人民军向中国人民解放军赠送锦旗，锦旗上写着：“向中国人民解放军战友们致以革命的敬礼！”叶剑英同志代表林彪同志和中国人民解放军全体指战员接受了这面锦旗。
    这时，康生同志领着大家高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”巴卢库同志也用中国话高呼：“毛泽东同志万岁！”
    最后，萧华同志领着全场一万多人齐声朗读毛主席在致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会贺电中的一段话：“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    出席今天大会的有各有关方面负责同志：彭绍辉、李天佑、王新亭、袁子钦、乔冠华、楚图南、陈士榘、吴克华、张贤约、谭家述、赵启民、吴先恩、刘少文、江文、路扬、李真、潘振武、徐文烈、王德、曹诚、苑化冰、兰侨、林彬、李钟奇等。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利也出席了大会。
