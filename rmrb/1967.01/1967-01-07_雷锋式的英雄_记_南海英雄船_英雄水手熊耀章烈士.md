Last August 29, in the early hours of the morning, the cargo ship 1018 sank under the relentless bombing by enemy aircraft. Our heroic crew members, Xiong Yaozhang and Xu Junrui, escorted the severely injured captain, Huang Busan, as they struggled in the turbulent waters of the Gulf of Tonkin. Enemy planes were tracking them overhead, and wave after wave crashed down upon them. Although Xiong Yaozhang was not a strong swimmer and had been injured in the struggle against the enemy aircraft, at this moment he had only one thought: he must save his injured comrades and seek revenge against American imperialism.

In the vast night sea, they pushed the life raft forward. Every step was a struggle, every step required immense effort and endured intense pain. In their hearts, they held the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." They were determined to save their class brothers from the sea.

Xiong Yaozhang, this warrior nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, thought only of how heroic Chinese sailors must overcome difficulties rather than be overcome by them. With Xu Junrui, he bravely paddled through the towering waves and finally brought the captain, who had sustained over thirty injuries, to a deserted island. There was nothing to eat, nothing to drink, and nothing to wear. The crew members faced a severe test. In this extremely harsh environment, Xiong Yaozhang, this young Communist Party member, told himself that the more difficult the situation, the more he must think of others and not himself. With no food, he hacked through the undergrowth to gather wild fruits. His feet were blistered, his hands were torn, and his chest and back were slashed with bloody wounds from the thorns. Yet, he never complained. He was afraid that his comrades might poison themselves by eating the wrong wild fruits, so he always tasted them first himself. There was no water on the island, so he climbed mountains to find fresh water. The seriously injured had no clothes, so he covered his class brothers with his only shirt, while he shivered with cold. He optimistically said, "Even if my skin is purple, my heart is warm!"

On the morning of August 31, the comrades' wounds worsened rapidly. Xiong Yaozhang's heart ached. This son of a poor peasant, this soldier of Chairman Mao, could not bear to see his comrades suffer. He could not sit still or stand steadily. He requested permission from the Party to swim out to seek help. He knew his swimming was poor, and swimming out to sea might cost him his life. But for his comrades, for his fellow soldiers, for his comrades to be rescued and return victorious to the motherland, he bravely dove into the sea and swam towards the distant island.

The vast waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, another heroic son of China has written a tragic poem with his life. Heroic Xiong Yaozhang, your spirit of serving the people is greater than the sea, higher than the waves. Although you never returned, your noble image will forever live in our hearts.

All things grow with the help of the sun, our heroes are nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

Xiong Yaozhang came from a poor family; for three generations, his family had been laborers for the landlords. It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who liberated him and raised him. He often said with tears, "Clothes are not as warm as fur, sugar is not as sweet as honey, but the affection of parents is not as great as that of Chairman Mao!" In school, his bag always contained Chairman Mao's books; his notebooks were filled with his beloved Chairman Mao's portrait.

During his service in the People's Navy, he was a dedicated soldier who studied Chairman Mao's works. People remember that at night, after the lights on the ship were turned off, he often lay in bed reciting Chairman Mao's quotations; when the ship was docked, he would lean against the lamppost by the pier to study.

The spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly shone brightly in Xiong Yaozhang. At noon, when others were resting, and on Sundays when comrades went out, he often took a shovel, worked under the scorching sun to remove rust from the ship or paint it. He often voluntarily helped the cooks wash and cut vegetables. As soon as the ship anchored in the harbor, before the duty officer had finished his shift, he would proactively pick up his gun and stand guard. Once, at a ferry crossing, he met an old woman returning home. He immediately helped her carry her heavy load of over a hundred pounds to the train station. His mind was always filled with images of heroes like Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, Lei Feng, and Wang Jie. He silently learned from these heroes.

One night, it was supposed to be Jiang Huasen's turn to stand guard, but knowing that Jiang Huasen had a slight eye problem, he quietly erased Jiang Huasen's name from the duty roster and wrote his own name instead. When he was sick, he often hid his illness from the doctor and continued to work despite his condition.

Once, Xiong Yaozhang was on watch at the bow of the ship and encountered a strong wind of level 7. Although he was seasick and vomiting, he thought this was a difficult task, and Chairman Mao had always taught that a revolutionary comrade should take on the heaviest burdens. He did not want to pass on the current heavy burden to others; he wanted to bear all the difficulties himself. He stood straight, tightly gripped the binoculars, and despite his comrades' objections, worked for six consecutive hours.

In his daily life, because Xiong Yaozhang strictly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, he was able to put his personal life and death aside in critical moments. Once, the ship was towing a floating pier with water drums to install water drums at a certain port. At that time, it happened to be windy and the waves were high. A batch of evil waves covered the sky and the earth. A steel cable tied to the pier snapped, followed by the second and third cables. It seemed that a disaster was about to occur. At this critical moment, Xiong Yaozhang took a quick step forward and used pliers to clamp the broken end of the steel cable. However, one person's strength could not withstand the pulling force of a floating pier weighing several hundred tons. He hugged the steel cable, shouting and warning himself: Hold on! Hold on! Hold on is victory! The steel wire cut into his hands, and blood flowed from the gaps in his hands, but he gritted his teeth and exerted all his strength to clamp! Clamp! His comrades arrived in time and avoided a major accident.

Comrade Xiong Yaozhang is a good example of studying and applying the "Three Articles." Before his death, he wrote in his diary: "I am determined to follow the example of Norman Bethune, not for fame, not for profit, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, to be a screw in the world revolution." He fulfilled his grand oath with heroic deeds. His shining image of loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought will forever illuminate the Gulf of Tonkin.

    雷锋式的英雄
    ——记“南海英雄船”英雄水手熊耀章烈士
    去年八月二十九日凌晨，一○一八号货轮在敌机狂轰滥炸中沉没了。我们的英雄船员熊耀章和许均瑞，护送着身负重伤的船长黄不三，搏斗在波涛汹涌的北部湾海面上。敌机在头顶上追踪，巨浪一个接一个地打来。熊耀章虽然水性不好，在船上和敌机搏斗中也受了摔伤，但是此时此刻他只有一个念头：一定要把受伤的战友救出来，向美帝国主义讨还血债。
    他们在茫茫的夜海中推着救生筏。游呀，游呀，每前进一步，都要付出极大的力气，忍受剧烈的疼痛。他们心里只有伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”决心要把阶级兄弟救出大海。
    熊耀章，我们这位毛泽东思想哺育出来的战士，他想的是，英雄的中国海员只能压倒困难，而不能被困难压倒。他和许均瑞满怀信心地蹬动两脚，闯过没头盖顶的浪涛，终于把身受三十几处伤的船长送到了一个荒岛上。这里没有吃的，没有喝的，没有穿的，船员们面临着严重的考验。就在这极端困苦的环境中，熊耀章这个年青的共产党员对自己说，越是困难的时候，越要“心中无我”，越要想到别人。没吃的，他就披荆斩棘到丛林里采野果。他的脚磨破了，手扎裂了，胸前背后被荆刺划破一道道血口子。可是，他从不叫苦。他怕同志们吃错了野果中毒，每次采集回来自己都先尝尝。岛上没水喝，他攀山越岭找淡水。重伤员没穿的，他把自己仅有的一件上衣盖在阶级兄弟身上，而自己冻得全身发抖。他乐观地说：“别看我皮肤发紫，我的心挺热乎哩！”
    八月三十一日早晨，同志们的伤口急剧恶化。熊耀章心如刀割。这个贫农的儿子，毛主席的战士，他不能眼睁睁地看着自己的同志受折磨。他坐不住，站不稳，他请求党批准他泅渡出去求援。他自己也知道自己的水性不好，游向大海很可能牺牲生命。但是，为了同志，为了战友，为了使自己的同志能够得到援救，胜利地回到祖国，他英勇地扑进了大海，向对面的大岛游去。
    白浪滔滔的北部湾的大海啊，又一个英雄的中华儿女，用自己的生命，在你这儿写下了悲壮的诗篇。英雄的熊耀章呵，你为人民服务的精神，比海大，比浪高。尽管你从此没有回来，但你崇高的英雄形象，永远活在人们的心间。
    万物生长靠太阳，我们的英雄是靠毛泽东思想培养出来的。
    熊耀章出身很苦，他家三代都给地主扛长工。是共产党毛主席解放了他，把他抚育成人。他常常流着热泪说：“衣暖不如皮，糖甜不如蜜，爹娘恩情重，不如毛主席！”在学校里读书时，他的挂包里就放着毛主席的书；他的笔记本里，就夹着心爱的毛主席的像片。
    他在人民海军服役期间，是一个热心学习毛主席著作的好战士。人们记得，夜里，舰上熄了灯，他经常躺在床上背诵毛主席语录；舰靠码头，他就倚着码头上的路灯学习。
    完全、彻底为人民服务的思想在熊耀章的身上闪闪发光。中午别人休息了，星期天同志们外出了，他经常一个人拿起铲子，顶着烈日给军舰敲铁锈或打油漆。他常常自动去帮助炊事员洗菜切菜。舰艇在港口刚刚抛锚，舰值日还没有把更值完，他就主动地提起枪去站岗。一次，他在过江码头上，遇到回家的一个老大娘，他马上帮她挑起一百多斤的重担，送老大娘到车站上。他脑子里经常装着张思德、白求恩、雷锋、王杰这些英雄们的形象。他默默地学习着这些英雄。
    一天晚上，本来该姜花森值更，但他知道姜花森眼睛有点小病，就悄悄在值更牌上把姜花森的名字涂掉，写上自己的名字。他自己病了，却经常背着别人，瞒着军医，带病坚持工作。
    有一次，熊耀章在舰首望更，碰到了七八级大风。他虽然晕船呕吐，但是他想到这是一项艰苦的工作，毛主席历来教导一个革命同志要抢挑重担子，他不愿意把眼前的重担子让给别人，他要把一切困难全部承担下来。他挺直腰板，紧紧握住望远镜，不顾同志们的劝阻，一气工作了六个小时。
    在平时，正因为熊耀章严格地按照毛主席的教导要求自己，所以在生命危险的紧要关头，他就能把个人的生死置之度外，一次，舰艇拉着一个载有水鼓的活动码头去某港安装水鼓。当时，正赶上风大浪高，一批恶浪遮天盖地而来。拴在码头上的一股钢缆“叭”地一声断了，接着第二股、第三股又断了，眼看就要发生惨祸。在这千钧一发的时刻，熊耀章一个箭步跨过去，用钢钳钳住了钢缆断处。但是一个人的力气，承受不了一个几百吨位活动码头的拉力。他抱住钢缆，一边喊，一边警告自己：坚持！坚持！坚持就是胜利！钢丝头扎破了手，鲜血从手缝里流出来，可是他咬紧牙关拚尽全力地钳！钳！同志们及时赶来了，避免了一场大事故。
    熊耀章同志是活学活用“老三篇”的好榜样。生前，他在日记中写道：“我决心以白求恩为榜样，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，做一个世界革命的螺丝钉。”他以英雄的行为实现了他豪迈的誓言。他的忠于毛泽东思想的光辉形象，永远照耀着北部湾。
