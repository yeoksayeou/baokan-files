The sky is red and the land is red, we have come to Shaoshan. This is where Chairman Mao was born, the sun of the East rises from here! This is an ordinary farmhouse, a revolutionary giant grew up here. The Three Mountains and Five Ridges sing "The East is Red," my hand touches the clay walls and my heart surges with waves of passion. In front of the window and under the lamp, grand plans are drawn, and waves of revolution rise from the pen. Awakening workers and peasants to take up arms, overthrowing the three great mountains, the people will rise up! Ah! He personally hoisted the first red flag in the mountains, planting the seeds of revolution in people's hearts. He awakened millions of revolutionary masses, forging ahead on the path of liberation, cutting through thorns and thistles! Through winds and rains over the decades, Chairman Mao has always been at the forefront. The revolutionary path grows wider, and the battle songs grow more joyous! Ah! The vegetable fields he worked in are now lush and green. The mountain paths he walked are filled with the enduring songs of the Red Guards. The military uniforms of our forefathers fit us perfectly, and the revolutionary banner is held high in our hands. We are the good red offspring, never stopping on the Long March! The Xiangjiang River flows, singing new songs, and the maple leaves on Yuelu Mountain are as red as fire. Look at the sun of the East, its rays shining over the vast world!

    太阳从这里升起
    ——访韶山
  　红卫兵　顾炯天也红来地也红，我们来到韶山冲。这就是毛主席的诞生地呵，东方的太阳从这里升起！这是一间普通的农舍，革命的巨人在这里成长。三山五岭高唱《东方红》，我手抚土墙心头滚热浪……窗前灯下构宏图，笔底波涛起风云。唤起工农举刀枪，推倒三座山，人民得翻身。呵！他亲手挂起山乡第一面红旗，把革命的火种播进人们心里。他唤起千百万革命群众，在解放的大道上披荆斩棘！风风雨雨几十年，毛主席永远走在最前面。革命的路越走越宽，战斗的歌越唱越欢！呵！他劳动过的菜地，呈现出一派新绿。他走过的山间小路，红卫兵的歌声经久不息。父辈的军装正合身，革命的大旗手中擎。我们是红色的好后代，长征路上永不停！湘江滔滔唱新歌，岳麓枫叶红似火。看东方的太阳光焰万里，要照红世界辽阔的大地！
