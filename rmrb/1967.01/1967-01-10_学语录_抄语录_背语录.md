	Study Quotations, Copy Quotations, Memorize Quotations
	Carry Them With You, Study Them Often

	A worker from a trade union in the temporary capital of Pakistan, Rawalpindi, is deeply fond of Chairman Mao's works. Recently, a friend of his gave him an English edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He treasures this book as his most precious possession, carrying it with him everywhere and studying it frequently.

	Every night before going to bed, he studies Chairman Mao's works diligently under the dim light of an oil lamp. To aid his memory, he writes down some of the aphorisms in his notebook.

	Whenever he encounters difficulties, he consults Chairman Mao's works. He says, "Chairman Mao's works are extremely rich and can help people understand and solve various problems. No matter when I read Chairman Mao's works, I feel my spirit invigorated and my strength doubled. Every word of Chairman Mao has given me great inspiration."

	He says, "Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal sun. His works are not only the beacon lighting the path for the Chinese people but also the beacon lighting the path for all oppressed people around the world. People all over the world will advance in the direction indicated by Mao Zedong."

	Sincerely Hope to Study

	Not long ago, during the exhibition of Chinese industrial and agricultural achievements in Brazzaville, a squad of Congolese (Brazzaville) militia from a camp dozens of miles away came to visit. The next day, they sent a representative to the exhibition to copy down Chairman Mao's quotations. This representative said, "Chairman Mao's quotations are very important and have great educational significance. Our soldiers sincerely hope to study these quotations and apply them in practice."

	The Most Precious Gift

	A friend from Tanzania, who was about to leave China and return home, was overcome with emotion and could not speak for a long time. After a while, he took out an English edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and said, "Words of farewell are the hardest to say. Let's read some quotations from Chairman Mao instead." Everyone then read, "All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat the American aggressors and all their lackeys!" After finishing the quotation, a Chinese comrade said, "When we Chinese comrades part, we often give each other quotations from Chairman Mao. Now, I will follow this custom and give you a quotation from Chairman Mao." Then, the Chinese comrade recited a quotation. The Tanzanian friend was deeply moved and said, "This is the most precious gift given to me. I will surely remember Chairman Mao's words."

	Recited Without a Single Mistake

	On a flight departing from Beijing, there were many foreign friends from Africa, Asia, and Europe. The flight attendants enthusiastically led the passengers in singing "The Ship Needs a Helmsman," a song praising our great leader. The entire cabin was filled with resonant singing.

	As the song ended, a group of African friends invited an African student to perform. The student adjusted his clothes and solemnly said, "Let me recite a quotation from Chairman Mao for everyone." He then recited in Chinese, "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go. This is what a good comrade should do." He recited the quotation without a single mistake.

	As soon as he finished, the cabin erupted in enthusiastic applause, praising him for reciting Chairman Mao's quotations so fluently.

	Writing Down Every Word and Sentence

	In late October last year, four African friends wearing Red Guard armbands arrived at the capital airport's waiting room. As soon as they sat down, they took out single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works and studied them intently. After a while, the service staff organized the passengers to read Chairman Mao's quotations aloud together. The four African friends immediately found a translator and copied down the recited quotations word for word into their notebooks. Seeing this, the service staff found an English edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and gave it to them. The four African friends did not understand English. However, they happily accepted the book and said, "Our friends understand English, and we will ask them to translate it for us to study."

	Every Word is Truth

	Two Chinese comrades were traveling in eastern Cuba. One noon, they entered a small restaurant by the countryside road to have lunch. As soon as they entered the restaurant, the Cuban waiter warmly asked, "Are you Chinese?" and arranged seats for them.

	While observing the restaurant's decorations, the Chinese comrades noticed that several quotations from Chairman Mao written in neat Spanish were posted on the walls. Near their seats, one quotation read, "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." Another quotation read, "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of primary importance for the revolution."

	The Chinese comrades asked a middle-aged Cuban male waiter, "Did you write these quotations yourselves?"

	The waiter said, "We wrote them ourselves. We like to read Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's words are all truths."

    学语录　抄语录　背语录
    随身带　经常学
    巴基斯坦临时首都拉瓦尔品第的一个工会会员，非常热爱毛主席的著作。他的一个朋友最近把一本英文版《毛主席语录》送给他。他把这本《毛主席语录》当作最珍贵的宝物，随身带着，经常学习。
    他每天晚上在上床之前都要在暗淡的油灯下刻苦地学习毛主席著作。为了便于记忆，他把一些警句记在笔记本上。
    每当遇到困难的时候，他就向毛主席著作请教。他说：“毛主席著作是非常丰富的，能够帮助人了解和解决各种问题。不管什么时候我读了毛主席著作，就感到精神振奋，力量倍增。毛主席的每句话都给了我很大启发。”
    他说：“毛泽东思想是永远不落的太阳。他（毛主席）的著作不仅是照亮中国人民前进道路的灯塔，而且是照亮世界上所有被压迫人民前进道路的灯塔。全世界人民终将按照毛泽东指引的方向前进。”
    真诚希望学习
    在不久前布拉柴维尔举行的中国工农业建设成就图片展览会展出期间，一队刚果（布）民卫团的民兵从几十里外的营地赶来参观。第二天，他们又专门派了一名代表，再次来展览会抄写毛主席的语录。这位代表说：“毛主席语录非常重要，具有重大的教育意义。我们的战士们真诚地希望学习这些语录，并在实践中运用。”
    最珍贵的礼物
    一位来自坦桑尼亚的朋友，即将离开中国回国了。离别之情使他久久说不出话来。过了一会，他拿出英文版的《毛主席语录》说：“分离的话是最难说的，还是让我们读几段毛主席语录吧。”于是大家念起了“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！……”语录念完了，一个中国同志说：我们中国同志在分别时，常常赠送毛主席语录。现在我就按照这习惯送你一条毛主席语录。接着，中国同志念了一段语录。坦桑尼亚朋友听了非常感动，他说：这是送给我的最珍贵的礼物，我一定要牢牢记住毛主席的话。
    背得一字不差
    在一次由北京起飞的班机上，坐着许多来自非洲、亚洲、欧洲的外国朋友。乘务员热情地领着旅客们唱《大海航行靠舵手》这首歌颂我们伟大领袖的歌曲，整个机舱充满了响亮的歌声。
    歌声一落，一群非洲朋友欢迎一个非洲留学生表演节目。这位留学生整一整衣服，非常郑重地说：我给大家背一条毛主席语录吧。于是他用中文背诵“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”这条语录，背得一字不差。
    他刚背完，座舱里立即爆发出一阵热烈的掌声，为他把毛主席语录背得这样熟而鼓掌。
    一字一句抄下来
    去年十月下旬，首都机场候机室里来了四个带着红卫兵袖章的非洲朋友。他们一坐下，就拿起毛主席著作单行本专心致志地学起来。过一会，服务员同志组织旅客齐声朗读毛主席语录。四位非洲朋友马上找翻译的同志，把念的语录一字一句往本子上抄。服务员同志看到这种情况，找了一本英文本的《毛主席语录》送给他们。这四位非洲朋友都不懂英文。但是他们高兴地收下了《语录》说：“我们的朋友有懂英文的，我们请他翻译出来学习。”
    句句是真理
    两位中国同志在古巴东部旅行。一天中午的时候，他们走进乡村公路旁的一家小餐馆，打算吃午饭。他们一走进这家小餐馆，古巴服务员立刻亲切地问：“中国人吗？”并为他们安排好了座位。
    中国同志在观察这家餐馆的陈设的时候，发现餐馆墙壁上贴着几张用端正的西班牙文写成的毛主席语录。靠近他们座位的墙上的一张语录写道：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”另一张语录写道：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”
    中国同志询问一位中年的古巴男服务员：“这些语录是你们自己写的吗？”
    这位服务员说：“是我们自己写上的。我们喜欢读毛主席的著作，毛主席的话句句都是真理。”
