British renowned philosopher Bertrand Russell says that it is necessary to resist and stop the Nazi-style aggression war that U.S. imperialism is waging in Vietnam. The only solution to the Vietnam problem is to force the U.S. aggressors to "immediately and unconditionally get out."

Russell made these remarks in the book "War Crimes in Vietnam," which was published here on the 5th. He also paid tribute to the Vietnamese people, saying: "The Vietnamese people are heroic, and their struggle is epic."

Russell emphasized that the U.S. aggression against Vietnam is just a part of the U.S. imperialists' ambition and actions to dominate the world. He said that Washington, over the years, has committed various atrocities both domestically and internationally to establish an "evil global empire."

Russell further pointed out: "In all regions of the world, the source of war and suffering is U.S. imperialism." He said, "It is impossible to persuade U.S. imperialism to stop aggression, stop exploitation, and stop atrocities." He stressed: "To adopt a conciliatory attitude towards those who have committed war crimes and are blatantly aggressive will not be beneficial, but will only increase their appetite for aggression."

Russell warned the Soviet revisionist leadership not to collude with U.S. imperialism and not to curry favor with the United States by opposing the struggle for national liberation.

    罗素警告苏修不要以反对民族解放斗争讨好美国
    美帝是一切战争和苦难的根源
    据新华社伦敦电  英国著名哲学家罗素说，必须抵抗和制止美帝国主义在越南进行的纳粹式的侵略战争。越南问题的唯一解决办法是迫使美国侵略者“立即无条件地滚出去”。
    罗素是在五日这里出版的《越南境内的战争罪行》这本书中这样说的。他还向越南人民致敬说：“越南人民是英雄的人民，他们的斗争是史诗式的。”
    罗素强调指出，美国侵略越南的战争，只不过是美帝国主义力图称霸世界的野心和行动的一部分。他说，华盛顿几年来，为了建立一个“罪恶的全球帝国”，“它在国内外一直干出各种暴行”。
    罗素进一步指出：“在世界上一切地区，战争和苦难的来源，都在于美帝国主义。”“要说服美帝国主义停止侵略，停止剥削和停止暴行，那是办不到的”。他强调：“对那些犯了战争罪行和明目张胆进行侵略的人采取姑息态度，是不会有好处的，而只会增大他们侵略的胃口。”罗素警告苏联修正主义领导集团不要同美帝国主义勾结，不要以反对争取民族解放的斗争来讨好美国。
