The world today is a scene of great tumult. The east wind sweeps ten thousand li, banners fly, the four seas are in turmoil, and the five continents are shaken. The world's hundreds of millions of revolutionary armies, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are surging forward, cleansing the earth, and making great revolutions throughout the world.

The world's people, through revolutionary struggle, increasingly understand: to smash the old world, we rely on Mao Zedong Thought; to build a new world, we also rely on Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionaries from various countries have limitless faith, limitless admiration, and limitless love for Mao Zedong Thought. Throughout the world, how many revolutionary fighters and ordinary laborers sing, "We will forever and ever sing the praises of Mao Zedong Thought." They say: The brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought "illuminates the hearts of all the people of the world," "turns the world red"; it "shines wherever it goes, and wherever it shines, the people have a direction to struggle for liberation and hope for revolutionary victory."

In the just-concluded year of 1966, which was of great historical significance, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great proletarian revolutionary Mao Zedong, "surged like a tidal wave, and the first barrage shook the entire globe."

Revolutionaries around the world unanimously celebrate this new great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Many revolutionaries point out: It is precisely this Great Revolution that has caused Mao Zedong Thought to spread with the force of a surging tide and the power of thunder, more rapidly, more broadly, and more deeply throughout the world.

    世界人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗大闹革命
    环顾今日全球，东风万里，战旗飞扬，四海翻腾，五洲震荡。世界亿万革命大军，正高举着毛泽东思想伟大红旗，冲击着全球，荡涤着大地，大闹世界革命。
    世界人民从革命斗争的实践中越来越懂得：要砸碎旧世界靠的是毛泽东思想，要建立新世界靠的也是毛泽东思想。
    各国革命者对毛泽东思想无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限热爱。世界上有多少革命战士和普普通通的劳动者，“要把毛泽东思想赞歌永远永远地歌唱”。他们说：毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，“照亮了全世界人民的心”，“照红了全世界”；它“照耀到哪里，哪里的人民就有了争取解放的方向，就有了革命胜利的希望”。
    在刚刚过去的一九六六年这个具有伟大历史意义的年度里，伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，“像海潮一样汹涌，第一排炮火就震撼了整个地球”。
    全世界革命者都同声欢庆毛泽东思想这一新的重大胜利。许多革命者指出：正是这场大革命，促使毛泽东思想“以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力”在全世界更加迅速、更加广阔、更加深入地传播。
