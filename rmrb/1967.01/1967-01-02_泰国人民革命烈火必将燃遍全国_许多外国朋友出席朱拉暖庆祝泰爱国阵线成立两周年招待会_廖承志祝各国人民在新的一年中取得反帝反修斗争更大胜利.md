The Thai Patriotic Front's overseas representative office held a reception tonight to celebrate the second anniversary of the Thai Patriotic Front. The reception was filled with a spirit of unity and struggle.

At the reception, the Thai Patriotic Front's overseas representative Paron Chularat, the chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Liao Chengzhi, the famous American black leader Robert F. Williams, and the renowned Thai female writer Chaloem Thiamchareon delivered passionate speeches.

Paron Chularat said in his speech that over the past two years since the establishment of the Thai Patriotic Front, it has firmly implemented the two policies of fighting for national independence and democracy, driving out the U.S. imperialist troops and aggressors from Thailand, and resolutely overthrowing the U.S. imperialist puppet and fascist dictatorship. As a result, the flames of struggle have been ignited in northeastern and southern Thailand. These sparks of revolution will soon be fanned by the revolutionary storm to engulf the entire nation.

Paron Chularat said that U.S. imperialism is in a dire situation, facing worldwide opposition and being severely beaten by the Vietnamese people's people's war, finding itself in a predicament. The Thai people will regard their armed struggle, people's war, and anti-U.S. imperialist and anti-Soviet revisionist movement as part of their support for the struggles of the oppressed peoples worldwide. They will stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese, Laotian, Malaysian, Cambodian, and Chinese peoples who are on the same battlefield against the same vicious enemy.

He said that the People's Republic of China, as a great bastion of the world's revolutionary people, has achieved tremendous victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong. Four days ago, it successfully conducted another nuclear test. This further boosts the confidence and courage of the world's people in defeating the imperialist aggression led by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, the Soviet modern revisionists, and all reactionaries.

Liao Chengzhi spoke at the reception. He first raised his glass to toast the second anniversary of the Thai Patriotic Front. He said that 1967 will be a year of greater victories for the Thai people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its puppet, the Thanom-Kittikachorn traitorous clique, and a year of greater victories for the people of all countries in their struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership and all reactionaries.

He said that in the new year, the Chinese people will hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, determined to make greater contributions in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and to more resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

He proposed a toast to the health and longevity of our greatest leader, Chairman Mao, and to the greater victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Robert F. Williams said in his speech that we, the liberation fighters from all over the world, have gathered in the powerful People's Republic of China. This is not a coincidence. China is the center of the world revolution, and the great Mao Zedong is the creator of people's war. Our struggles complement each other because our just cause is common. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of all the peoples of the world who love freedom, justice, and peace.

Robert F. Williams said that we American blacks understand: submission and begging for mercy will only make the brutal oppressors tighten the noose around our necks. Like all revolutionary brothers and sisters around the world, we are determined to meet force with force and violence with violence.

He enthusiastically hailed the success of China's fifth nuclear test in his speech.

Chaloem Thiamchareon said in her speech that Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful." We Thai women must fight side by side with our male comrades to overthrow the bloody rule of U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionary government and save our motherland.

Guests invited to the reception included Vietnamese Ambassador to China Tran Huy Lieu, member of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China Le Thong Son, Counselor of the Cambodian Embassy in China Sen Lyssot, head of the delegation of the Malayan National Liberation League in China Shalmar, head of the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beijing, Khaled, President of the Lao Women's Union, Kounying Bounsavath, Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Charoen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian-African Writers' Bureau, Isa, Japanese peace activist Nishizono Koichi, Sudanese peace activist Kair, and others.

At the end of the reception, Thai friends sang the Thai revolutionary song "Revolutionary Phuphan Mountain," and at their initiative, everyone sang "The East Is Red." Paron Chularat led the crowd in shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

    泰国人民革命烈火必将燃遍全国
    许多外国朋友出席朱拉暖庆祝泰爱国阵线成立两周年招待会
    廖承志祝各国人民在新的一年中取得反帝反修斗争更大胜利
    据新华社一日讯　泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表处今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝泰国爱国阵线成立两周年。
    在洋溢着团结战斗气氛的招待会上，泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖，中国亚非团结委员会主任廖承志、美国著名黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉，泰国著名女作家差慝·柿巴立先后发表了热情的讲话。
    帕荣·朱拉暖在讲话中说，泰国爱国阵线成立以来的两年中，坚定地执行了为国家的独立、民主而奋斗，把美帝国主义的军队和侵略势力从泰国赶出去，和坚决打倒美帝国主义的走狗、法西斯独裁政权这两项政策，结果是在泰国东北部和南部，已经燃起了斗争的烈火。这两个地区的星星之火，在不久的将来定将被革命的风暴吹遍全国。
    帕荣·朱拉暖说，美帝国主义处于被全世界人民奋起反对和被越南人民用人民战争打得焦头烂额、进退维谷的形势。泰国人民将把自己的武装斗争、人民战争、反美帝和反苏修的运动看作是对全世界被压迫人民斗争的支持的一部分，并将和正在同一个战场上面对着凶恶的敌人的越南人民、老挝人民、马来亚人民、柬埔寨人民和中国人民并肩战斗。
    他说，作为世界革命人民伟大的堡垒的中华人民共和国，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指导下，无产阶级文化大革命获得了巨大的胜利；在四天前又圆满地实现了一次新的核爆炸。这样就更加增强了世界人民战胜以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的侵略及其帮凶苏联现代修正主义集团以及一切反动派的信心和勇气。
    廖承志在招待会上讲话，他首先举杯祝贺泰国爱国阵线成立两周年。他接着说，一九六七年将是泰国人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗他侬—巴博卖国集团斗争取得更大胜利的一年，也是世界各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义及一切反动派斗争取得更大胜利的一年。
    他说，在新的一年里，中国人民将更高地举起马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗，决心在反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的斗争中，作出更大的贡献，更坚决地支持世界各国人民的革命斗争。
    他最后提议为我们最伟大的领袖毛主席的健康长寿、为无产阶级文化大革命取得更大胜利干杯。
    罗伯特·威廉在讲话中说，我们来自五湖四海的解放战士，在强大的中华人民共和国会晤在一起，这并不是一件偶然的事。中国是世界革命的中心，伟大的毛泽东是人民战争的缔造者。我们各自的斗争相辅相成，因为我们的正义事业是共同的。美帝国主义是全世界爱好自由、正义与和平的各国人民的共同的头号敌人。
    罗伯特·威廉说，我们美国黑人懂得：逆来顺受和哀求怜悯，只能使残暴的压迫者把我们脖子上的绞索拉得更紧。我们和全世界的革命兄弟一样，也决心以武力对付武力，以暴力对付暴力。
    他在讲话中热烈欢呼中国第五次核试验成功。
    差慝·柿巴立在讲话中说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”我们泰国妇女只有和男同胞一起并肩战斗，才能打倒美帝国主义和泰国反动政府的血腥统治，拯救自己的祖国。
    应邀出席招待会的，有越南驻中国大使陈子平，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团团员黎松山，柬埔寨驻中国大使馆参赞沈力速，马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布，老挝妇女联合会主席贵宁·奔舍那夫人，亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，亚非作家常设局代理秘书长伊萨，日本和平人士西园寺公一，苏丹和平人士凯尔等。
    在招待会结束时，泰国朋友们演唱了泰国革命歌曲《革命的普潘山》，并在他们的倡议下，大家齐唱《大海航行靠舵手》，帕荣·朱拉暖还带头欢呼“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”
