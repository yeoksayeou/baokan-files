The entire world's revolutionary people will never forgive the Soviet revisionists. In Beijing, foreign friends, filled with indignation, demonstrated in front of the Soviet embassy, strongly protesting the Soviet revisionist clique's savage suppression of our students studying in Europe.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated January 28, the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionists against our students studying abroad have aroused the intense indignation of foreign revolutionary experts and revolutionary students in Beijing. They joined hands and stood shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary rebels of the capital, braving rain and snow, to march and demonstrate in front of the Soviet Embassy in China, strongly protesting the heinous crimes of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

On the evening the news of the Soviet authorities beating our students studying in Europe reached from Moscow, a group of experts and students from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, filled with indignation, came to the gates of the Soviet Embassy in China. They held up portraits of Chairman Mao, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung," and together with the revolutionary rebel masses of the capital who came to march and demonstrate, they shouted in unison: "Down with the Soviet revisionists!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Tse-tung!"

In front of the Soviet Embassy in China, many revolutionary foreign friends expressed their anger to reporters, denouncing the savage behavior of the Soviet revisionists. The Malaysian writer Sharma angrily said: "You Soviet revisionist bastards! Remember, your days of collaborating with American imperialism are numbered! All your conspiracies against China and against the revolutionary people of the world are doomed to fail! You suppress the proletarian revolutionaries who respect the great leader of the world revolution, Lenin, and the faithful students of the great Mao Tse-tung. You are suppressing the people of the world who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Tse-tung thought. The people of the world will not forgive you!" He angrily shouted: "Down with Brezhnev!" "Down with Kosygin!"

Students from Albania, a frontline country against revisionism, Vanjer and Yilo, expressed their determination: We firmly support the just struggle of Chinese students! We are determined to stand together with Chinese comrades, fight together, and win together! We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end! We will carry the struggle against modern revisionism to the end!

On the evening of January 27, more than fifty Japanese experts and students in Beijing braved the snow to come to the gates of the Soviet Embassy in China. They held up banners and flags written in Japanese, shouting repeatedly in front of the embassy: "People of the world, unite! Beat the Soviet revisionists!" They shouted with the Chinese revolutionary rebel masses in Chinese: "Long live the great leader of the people of the world, Chairman Mao!" "Rebellion is justified!" "Smash the heads of the Soviet revisionists!" Experts Takano Hiroshi, students Hayashi Teruko, and Sakai Makoto told reporters that the more the Soviet revisionists oppose China, the more it proves that China is correct. They beat Chinese students studying in Europe, proving that they are strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and are very afraid of Mao Tse-tung thought. The days of the Soviet revisionist clique are numbered. China is the base of world revolution. Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, we will further master Mao Tse-tung thought and carry the revolution of Japan and the world to the end.

Indonesian friends Mudiro and Ati also took to the streets to demonstrate. Mudiro and Ati said that the Soviet revisionists have done many evil deeds against China and have also done many evil deeds against the revolutionary people of Indonesia. The revolutionary people of the world will only be thoroughly liberated by relying on Mao Tse-tung thought. In the future, we will resolutely follow the path of Mao Tse-tung and build a brand new Indonesia.

Colombian friend Andrada, holding a red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung," told reporters that the Soviet revisionists beating Chinese students studying abroad has made the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the world see even more clearly their ugly collusion with American imperialism. Now, the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the whole world are opposing imperialism led by the United States, opposing modern revisionism, and opposing the reactionaries of all countries. This struggle, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Tse-tung, will achieve even greater victories. South African friend Land pointed out that the Soviet authorities suppressed Chinese students who laid wreaths at the tombs of Lenin and Stalin, once again exposing their ugly revisionist faces. They have betrayed Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism and will be severely condemned by the revolutionary people of all countries.

　　全世界革命人民绝不会饶恕苏修混蛋
　　在京外国朋友义愤填膺到苏联使馆门前示威
　　强烈抗议苏修集团野蛮镇压我国的留欧学生
    据新华社二十八日讯　苏修混蛋们镇压我国留学生的法西斯暴行，激起了在北京的外国革命专家和革命的留学生的极大愤慨。他们同首都广大革命造反派的群众，手挽手，肩并肩，冒着雨雪，到苏联驻中国大使馆门前游行示威，强烈抗议苏联修正主义统治集团的滔天罪行。
    苏修当局毒打我国留欧学生的消息从莫斯科传来的当天晚上，一批来自亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的专家和留学生，就义愤填膺，来到苏联驻中国大使馆门前。他们高举着毛主席像，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，和前来游行示威的首都革命造反群众同声高呼：“打倒苏修！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    在苏联驻中国大使馆门前，许多革命的外国朋友纷纷向记者发表谈话，痛斥苏修混蛋们的野蛮行为。马来亚作家沙尔玛愤怒地说：“苏联修正主义丑恶的家伙！你们记住，你们同美帝国主义合作的日子不长了！你们的一切反华和反对世界革命人民的阴谋是注定要失败的！你们镇压敬仰世界革命伟大导师列宁的无产阶级革命者，镇压伟大毛泽东的忠实学生，也就是镇压高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的世界革命的人民。全世界人民是不会饶恕你们的！”他愤怒地高呼：“打倒勃列日涅夫！”“打倒柯西金！”
    来自反修前线的阿尔巴尼亚留学生万介尔和伊洛激动地表示：我们坚决支持中国留学生的正义斗争！我们决心同中国同志团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底！
    二十七日晚间，五十多位在京的日本专家、留学生冒雪来到苏联驻中国大使馆门前。他们手擎用日文写的标语牌和标语旗，在大使馆门前一次又一次地振臂高呼：“全世界人民团结起来，打倒苏修！”他们和中国的革命造反群众一起用中国话高呼：“全世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”“革命无罪，造反有理！”“砸烂苏修的狗头！”专家高野广海、留学生林照子和酒井诚对记者说，苏修愈是反对中国，愈说明中国正确。他们毒打中国留欧学生，证明了他们外强中干，非常害怕毛泽东思想。苏修集团的命运不长了。中国是世界革命的根据地，通过中国的无产阶级文化大革命，我们将进一步把毛泽东思想学到手，把日本的革命、世界的革命进行到底。
    印度尼西亚朋友穆迪罗和阿蒂，今天也走上街头示威游行。穆迪罗和阿蒂说，苏修做尽了反华坏事，对印尼革命人民也做尽了坏事。世界革命人民要得到彻底解放，只有依靠毛泽东思想。今后，我们将坚决走毛泽东道路，建立一个崭新的印度尼西亚。
    哥伦比亚朋友安德拉德手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》对记者说，苏修毒打中国留学生，使苏联人民、全世界人民更加看清了他们和美帝国主义勾结的丑恶面目。现在，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界所有革命人民正在反对以美国为首的帝国主义，反对现代修正主义，反对各国反动派，这个斗争在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，将会取得更大胜利。南非朋友兰德指出，苏修当局镇压到列宁、斯大林墓前献花圈的中国留学生，再一次暴露了他们的修正主义丑恶面目。他们背叛了马列主义和无产阶级国际主义，将要受到世界各国革命人民的严正谴责。
