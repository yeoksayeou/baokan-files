On December 30th of last year, the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces launched a large-scale invasion of Battambang Province's Bat Village in Cambodia. This is yet another blatant provocation and act of aggression by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against Cambodia.

U.S. imperialism has long adopted a policy of high pressure and intimidation against Cambodia. U.S. imperialism seeks to sabotage Cambodia's independence and neutrality, but the Cambodian people firmly oppose this; U.S. imperialism wants Cambodia to abandon its support for the Vietnamese people, the Lao people, and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their anti-U.S. struggles, but the Cambodian people firmly refuse. Therefore, U.S. imperialism resorts to pressure and threats. As pointed out in a statement by the Royal Government of Cambodia, the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet forces' attack on Cambodian peaceful villages is part of the long-term policy of high pressure and intimidation against Cambodia by the authorities in Washington and Saigon.

After the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan, Chairman Mao said to the Chinese people: "We must have a clear mind, which includes not believing in the 'kind words' of imperialism and not fearing the threats of imperialism."

In their struggle against U.S. imperialism, the Cambodian people are doing just that. The Cambodian *New Telegraph* emphasized: The Cambodian people cannot wait or hope for the "rationality" and "benevolence" of the U.S. government and its lackeys; to yield to their provocations and threats is to sign one's own death warrant. The Cambodian people, who fear no strong enemies and dare to fight, have repeatedly foiled and dealt heavy blows to the high-pressure and intimidation policies of U.S. imperialism.

The Chinese people strongly condemn the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against Cambodia and firmly support the just struggle of the Cambodian people.

    柬埔寨不怕美帝的恐吓
    本报评论员
    去年十二月三十日，美国—南越伪军又大规模地侵犯柬埔寨柴桢省巴图村。这是美帝国主义及其走狗对柬埔寨的又一次明目张胆的挑衅和侵略。
    美帝国主义一直对柬埔寨实行高压和恫吓的政策。美帝国主义要破坏柬埔寨的独立和中立，柬埔寨人民坚决反对；美帝国主义要柬埔寨放弃对越南人民、老挝人民，以及亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反美斗争的支持，柬埔寨人民坚决不干。于是，美帝国主义就施用压力，进行威胁。正像柬埔寨王国政府公报中指出的，美国—南越伪军袭击柬埔寨的和平村庄，这是华盛顿和西贡当局长期以来对柬埔寨实行的高压和恫吓政策的一部分。
    毛主席在中国抗日战争胜利后曾对中国人民说过：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”
    柬埔寨人民在同美帝国主义的斗争中，也是这样做的。柬埔寨《新电讯报》强调指出：柬埔寨人民决不能等待或期望“美国政府及其仆从的‘理智’和‘仁慈’”；屈服于它们的挑衅和恫吓，“就等于在自己的死刑判决书上签了字”。不畏强敌、敢于斗争的柬埔寨人民，使美帝国主义的高压和恫吓政策一再破产，一再受到沉重的打击。
    中国人民强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗对柬埔寨的侵略行为，坚决支持柬埔寨人民的正义斗争。
