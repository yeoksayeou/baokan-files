The great thought of Mao Zedong, like a blazing torch, illuminates the globe; like a red flag dancing in the sky, it spreads across the world. Mao Zedong Thought is now in the hands of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses around the world, becoming an inexhaustible force for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and the most powerful and irresistible weapon in the world.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for the people's revolution. It leads the world's revolutionary army along the correct path of struggle, forever advancing towards victory.

Learning Mao Zedong Thought is the most important task for revolutionaries

Many revolutionaries in various countries say that Mao Zedong Thought is "indispensable spiritual sustenance that cannot be missed for a single day." Mexican revolutionaries say that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is "the first necessity of life." A person from Botswana points out, "Studying Mao Zedong Thought is the most important task for all revolutionaries in the world." Now, more and more revolutionaries around the world have this urgent demand, and a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works is surging in various countries.

Many revolutionaries in various countries say, "With Chairman Mao's books, it's like a fish in water." After reading Chairman Mao's works, "the heart warms up and the mind brightens"; "one dares to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea." They say: "Chairman Mao's books are absolutely true, every word is worth a thousand gold pieces," "every sentence shines with the light of truth." They say: "Mao Zedong's books are red seeds that will definitely take root, sprout, bloom, and bear fruit in the hearts of all the people of the world." They say: "Chairman Mao's works are a vast treasure trove of proletarian revolutionary theory, and one must use all one's energy to study and apply it." Many revolutionaries in various countries treat Chairman Mao's books as "revolutionary manuals" and "essential textbooks." Many people carry Chairman Mao's works with them, studying whenever they encounter something, studying at all times. Many freedom fighters in African countries, before returning to the front lines from abroad, despite the long journey and crossing the enemy's numerous blockades, risking their lives, carefully bring in large quantities of Chairman Mao's works into the mountains and forests, as the most precious gifts to hand over to their close comrades-in-arms. Comrades-in-arms, as soon as they receive the books, affectionately kiss them and immediately start reading.

The publication of Chairman Mao's works abroad is a world-shaking joyous event

Today, revolutionary people of all countries are most eager to obtain Chairman Mao's books. Since China launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, their desire has become even stronger. Now, there are more than 150 countries and regions around the world that have ordered Chairman Mao's works from China. In 1966, the number of Chairman Mao's works published in China and distributed abroad was approximately 100 times that of the entire year of 1952, making it the year with the highest distribution since liberation. Despite this, it is still far from meeting the needs of a wide range of readers abroad. People of all countries are clamoring to increase the number of publications. Many countries also translated and published Chairman Mao's works themselves. According to incomplete statistics, currently, more than 50 countries and regions have translated and published Chairman Mao's works in more than 60 languages, with more than 670 kinds of single-volume editions alone. More than 30 countries have also published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Recently, many fraternal parties and Marxist-Leninist organizations have made decisions to accelerate the translation and publication of Chairman Mao's works. Some have even established special committees for this purpose and formulated long-term plans.

Recently, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has been translated into many languages and published abroad, immediately becoming a world-shaking joyous event. Revolutionary people of the five continents welcomed it like a rain after a long drought, eagerly buying and studying it. Western bourgeois newspapers exclaimed that it is "the best-selling book in the world," "the book that conquers the world." In Japan alone, within less than a month, four editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" were translated and published, one of which sold out its first batch of 50,000 copies in no time, an unprecedented event in the history of Japanese book distribution. People of various countries, after obtaining this book, cherished it like a treasure, praising it highly. Some said, "Every word in the book flew into my heart." Lao artists, upon receiving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," excitedly expressed, "We must carry it with us, study it every day, and even if we sacrifice our lives, we will not abandon this book." Many revolutionaries said, reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is like being by Chairman Mao's side, like listening to his teachings every day.

Mao Zedong Thought gives revolutionary people the courage and strength to fight

Countless revolutionary people around the world, with strong revolutionary enthusiasm, eagerly study Chairman Mao's works. Countless people, holding "Chairman Mao's treasure book," forget to sleep and eat, cherishing it dearly. Countless people, carrying "Chairman Mao's red book," study in life and in struggle. Many liberation fighters in various countries, carrying Chairman Mao's books, enter deep mountains and forests, take up weapons to wage guerrilla warfare. Many revolutionaries in various countries, carrying Chairman Mao's books, go deep into remote villages, establishing revolutionary bases. In enemy prisons, under white terror, and in the face of death threats, there are countless revolutionary martyrs who, with great revolutionary spirit, persist in reading Chairman Mao's works. They say, it is Mao Zedong Thought that gives them endless wisdom, courage, confidence, and strength in struggle.

A friend from Latin America said well: "Wherever the people take up arms, there is Chairman Mao's guidance." Soldiers and guerrillas of the liberation armies of Vietnam, Laos, Congo (Leopoldville), Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, on the battlefield where cannons roar, in the trenches filled with gunpowder, always remember to study Chairman Mao's works.

A commander of an anti-aircraft unit guarding the front line in Laos, pointing to the Fu Kote Mountain position, proudly said: "On this mountain, the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs have poured down tens of thousands of tons of bombs and shells, shaving off two meters of soil, but it still stands firmly, always under the control of our heroic people. Isn't this just as Chairman Mao said, the human factor is first, and it is people, not weapons, that decide the outcome of a war?"

Angolan guerrillas in the Cabinda region of Africa have been active in the vast and endless forests for years. The place is vast and sparsely populated, dark and humid, and the environment is very harsh. However, they remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades in difficult times should see achievements, see light, and increase our courage." They are full of confidence in victory. They printed Chairman Mao's works and used them as textbooks during camping to conduct political, military, and cultural education. Freedom fighters in Zimbabwe said that their struggle experience has proven that the clich√©s of some people about "achieving liberation through peaceful means" have completely failed, and Chairman Mao's thesis that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is absolutely correct.

A friend from Peru pointed out that revolutionaries in Latin America are using the theory created by Chairman Mao of first the countryside and then the cities, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and finally seizing national victory. Nicaraguan revolutionaries, in the life-and-death struggle against U.S. imperialism and the reactionary rule of their own country, the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries surrounded them, and revisionists betrayed them, the environment was very treacherous, and the struggle was very arduous. However, they said, whenever they think of Chairman Mao's thesis that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," they increase their confidence and boost their morale.

The heroic spirit of pursuing revolutionary truth is unconquerable

Serious injuries and fatal diseases cannot conquer the revolutionary spirit of pursuing revolutionary truth. A 20-year-old African freedom fighter was honorably wounded in a brave battle against colonial troops. He lay on the sickbed, stubbornly studying Chairman Mao's works. He forgot the pain of his wounds and insisted on recording his study notes. He saw the prospect of victory from Chairman Mao's works and wrote to his comrades on the front line, encouraging them to overcome all difficulties and advance bravely. A friend in Japan, due to a serious illness, has been bedridden for many years. He, with a firm belief in Mao Zedong Thought, persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works until his death. His friends were moved by his indomitable will and expressed their determination to inherit his will and study Chairman Mao's works diligently.

Iron bars cannot block the light of truth. A revolutionary youth in Venezuela was arrested for participating in anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles. He disregarded his personal safety and never forgot to study Mao Zedong Thought. He specially asked his relatives to secretly send two volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" into the prison and studied them diligently. He also cleverly organized his fellow prisoners to take turns reading and discussing. Some revolutionaries, when subjected to severe torture, remained unyielding because they learned the spirit of hard bones and unyielding revolutionary character from Chairman Mao's books.

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are afraid of the spread of truth. They try every means to block the great Mao Zedong Thought. However, thousands and millions of people, at the risk of their lives, travel everywhere, trying to obtain Chairman Mao's works. In the Soviet Union, where modern revisionism prevails, a worker, after two years of effort, finally obtained the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" he had longed for from a good friend. Some Soviet youths, after studying Chairman Mao's works, wrote to Chairman Mao: "Only your thoughts can save my country." He expressed, "I do not want to be a victim of modern revisionism, but I want to be a true revolutionary!"

Currently, in the wave of studying Chairman Mao's works among revolutionary people of various countries, a new feature has emerged, that is, many revolutionaries have begun to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a motto, as a weapon to transform people's souls. The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), "Vanguard," in calling on Australian Marxist-Leninists and progressives to seriously study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," emphasized that the "Three Constantly Read Articles" have "endless meanings. They indicate that all those who aspire to be true Marxist-Leninists and communists can only be transformed through serving the people and abandoning all selfish individualism in practice." The Chilean "Spartacus" pointed out: "The 'Three Constantly Read Articles' are making millions of ordinary workers understand the revolutionary significance of their work, combining their personal wishes with the interests of the broad masses of the people and the world revolution."

Recently, many Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations in various countries have made decisions and issued instructions, calling on all party members and laborers to "study, master, and universally apply Mao Zedong Thought, and arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought"; calling on them to "study Mao Zedong's works in a planned, organized, and in-depth manner," and to regard it as the party's central task to carry it out. Now, many fraternal parties' broad party members and cadres are studying Chairman Mao's works in an organized manner, which is becoming a trend. In progressive circles around the world, study organizations of Chairman Mao's works are emerging like mushrooms after rain.

While striving to study Chairman Mao's works, revolutionaries around the world are actively and enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought. A patriot in Laos said, "The wider Mao Zedong Thought spreads, the more the world revolution develops." A writer in Thailand pointed out: "Propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought is the responsibility of every revolutionary." Many revolutionaries in various countries volunteer to be honorable "propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought." Young people in Lesotho and Haiti are systematically collecting Chairman Mao's works to establish libraries. Some revolutionaries, under extremely difficult conditions, print Chairman Mao's famous articles into booklets and distribute them widely. Some copy Chairman Mao's quotations and send them to relatives and friends, and some even record the quotations broadcast by Beijing Radio and play them for others to listen to. A writer in Pakistan said: "My greatest wish in life is to translate Mao Zedong's works into Urdu and introduce Mao Zedong Thought to the people of Pakistan. This will be the most meaningful work of my life." A propagandist of the Fiery District Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, in the past two or three years, has read the Albanian version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" many times, often sharing his insights and experiences with workers, soldiers, intellectuals, and cadres in this district, introducing study experiences, and is very welcome. He said: "I study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought with great love for the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao."

Head can be cut off, blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned!

Head can be cut off, blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned! Revolutionary people around the world bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. Many revolutionaries solemnly vow to Chairman Mao: "As your students, we will forever be loyal to your teachings; like the sunflower facing the sun, we will follow your thoughts." They say: Mao Zedong Thought is "the lifeline of the world's revolutionary people," is "the lifeline of the world revolution." "We must defend Mao Zedong Thought like cherishing the common wealth of all laboring people of the world." "We must cherish it like cherishing our own lives, because it guides us to gain something more precious than life." A Soviet youth in a letter to the beloved Chairman Mao expressed his unshakable determination: "I want to be your soldier. I swear to fight to the end against modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU! I swear to spare no effort, even my life, to fight for the realization of your thoughts in my country! I swear to fight for the revival of true Marxism-Leninism in my country! I firmly believe that your thoughts will definitely become the guiding principles for all work in my country. In the future, all the people of the world will see that the flag of true Marxism-Leninism‚Äîyour thoughts‚Äîwill rise over the Kremlin!"

Chairman Mao has wisely pointed out a magnificent revolutionary prospect for all the people of the world. Currently, revolutionary people around the world are following the path indicated by Chairman Mao, fearing no sacrifice, advancing bravely, and thoroughly smashing the heavy shackles on their backs to become the masters of the new era. A bright red new world will definitely be born, following Mao Zedong's magnificent ideal, in the triumphant march of "The East Is Red" and "The Internationale." Workers of the world, unite! People of the world, unite! Hold high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, facing the dawn of victory, and bravely advance towards a brilliant future!
