The great thought of Mao Zedong, like a blazing torch, illuminates the globe; like a red flag dancing in the sky, it spreads across the world. Mao Zedong Thought is now in the hands of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses around the world, becoming an inexhaustible force for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, and the most powerful and irresistible weapon in the world.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guide for the people's revolution. It leads the world's revolutionary army along the correct path of struggle, forever advancing towards victory.

Learning Mao Zedong Thought is the most important task for revolutionaries

Many revolutionaries in various countries say that Mao Zedong Thought is "indispensable spiritual sustenance that cannot be missed for a single day." Mexican revolutionaries say that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is "the first necessity of life." A person from Botswana points out, "Studying Mao Zedong Thought is the most important task for all revolutionaries in the world." Now, more and more revolutionaries around the world have this urgent demand, and a wave of studying Chairman Mao's works is surging in various countries.

Many revolutionaries in various countries say, "With Chairman Mao's books, it's like a fish in water." After reading Chairman Mao's works, "the heart warms up and the mind brightens"; "one dares to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea." They say: "Chairman Mao's books are absolutely true, every word is worth a thousand gold pieces," "every sentence shines with the light of truth." They say: "Mao Zedong's books are red seeds that will definitely take root, sprout, bloom, and bear fruit in the hearts of all the people of the world." They say: "Chairman Mao's works are a vast treasure trove of proletarian revolutionary theory, and one must use all one's energy to study and apply it." Many revolutionaries in various countries treat Chairman Mao's books as "revolutionary manuals" and "essential textbooks." Many people carry Chairman Mao's works with them, studying whenever they encounter something, studying at all times. Many freedom fighters in African countries, before returning to the front lines from abroad, despite the long journey and crossing the enemy's numerous blockades, risking their lives, carefully bring in large quantities of Chairman Mao's works into the mountains and forests, as the most precious gifts to hand over to their close comrades-in-arms. Comrades-in-arms, as soon as they receive the books, affectionately kiss them and immediately start reading.

The publication of Chairman Mao's works abroad is a world-shaking joyous event

Today, revolutionary people of all countries are most eager to obtain Chairman Mao's books. Since China launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, their desire has become even stronger. Now, there are more than 150 countries and regions around the world that have ordered Chairman Mao's works from China. In 1966, the number of Chairman Mao's works published in China and distributed abroad was approximately 100 times that of the entire year of 1952, making it the year with the highest distribution since liberation. Despite this, it is still far from meeting the needs of a wide range of readers abroad. People of all countries are clamoring to increase the number of publications. Many countries also translated and published Chairman Mao's works themselves. According to incomplete statistics, currently, more than 50 countries and regions have translated and published Chairman Mao's works in more than 60 languages, with more than 670 kinds of single-volume editions alone. More than 30 countries have also published "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Recently, many fraternal parties and Marxist-Leninist organizations have made decisions to accelerate the translation and publication of Chairman Mao's works. Some have even established special committees for this purpose and formulated long-term plans.

Recently, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has been translated into many languages and published abroad, immediately becoming a world-shaking joyous event. Revolutionary people of the five continents welcomed it like a rain after a long drought, eagerly buying and studying it. Western bourgeois newspapers exclaimed that it is "the best-selling book in the world," "the book that conquers the world." In Japan alone, within less than a month, four editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" were translated and published, one of which sold out its first batch of 50,000 copies in no time, an unprecedented event in the history of Japanese book distribution. People of various countries, after obtaining this book, cherished it like a treasure, praising it highly. Some said, "Every word in the book flew into my heart." Lao artists, upon receiving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," excitedly expressed, "We must carry it with us, study it every day, and even if we sacrifice our lives, we will not abandon this book." Many revolutionaries said, reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is like being by Chairman Mao's side, like listening to his teachings every day.

Mao Zedong Thought gives revolutionary people the courage and strength to fight

Countless revolutionary people around the world, with strong revolutionary enthusiasm, eagerly study Chairman Mao's works. Countless people, holding "Chairman Mao's treasure book," forget to sleep and eat, cherishing it dearly. Countless people, carrying "Chairman Mao's red book," study in life and in struggle. Many liberation fighters in various countries, carrying Chairman Mao's books, enter deep mountains and forests, take up weapons to wage guerrilla warfare. Many revolutionaries in various countries, carrying Chairman Mao's books, go deep into remote villages, establishing revolutionary bases. In enemy prisons, under white terror, and in the face of death threats, there are countless revolutionary martyrs who, with great revolutionary spirit, persist in reading Chairman Mao's works. They say, it is Mao Zedong Thought that gives them endless wisdom, courage, confidence, and strength in struggle.

A friend from Latin America said well: "Wherever the people take up arms, there is Chairman Mao's guidance." Soldiers and guerrillas of the liberation armies of Vietnam, Laos, Congo (Leopoldville), Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, on the battlefield where cannons roar, in the trenches filled with gunpowder, always remember to study Chairman Mao's works.

A commander of an anti-aircraft unit guarding the front line in Laos, pointing to the Fu Kote Mountain position, proudly said: "On this mountain, the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs have poured down tens of thousands of tons of bombs and shells, shaving off two meters of soil, but it still stands firmly, always under the control of our heroic people. Isn't this just as Chairman Mao said, the human factor is first, and it is people, not weapons, that decide the outcome of a war?"

Angolan guerrillas in the Cabinda region of Africa have been active in the vast and endless forests for years. The place is vast and sparsely populated, dark and humid, and the environment is very harsh. However, they remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades in difficult times should see achievements, see light, and increase our courage." They are full of confidence in victory. They printed Chairman Mao's works and used them as textbooks during camping to conduct political, military, and cultural education. Freedom fighters in Zimbabwe said that their struggle experience has proven that the clichés of some people about "achieving liberation through peaceful means" have completely failed, and Chairman Mao's thesis that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is absolutely correct.

A friend from Peru pointed out that revolutionaries in Latin America are using the theory created by Chairman Mao of first the countryside and then the cities, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and finally seizing national victory. Nicaraguan revolutionaries, in the life-and-death struggle against U.S. imperialism and the reactionary rule of their own country, the U.S. imperialists and reactionaries surrounded them, and revisionists betrayed them, the environment was very treacherous, and the struggle was very arduous. However, they said, whenever they think of Chairman Mao's thesis that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," they increase their confidence and boost their morale.

The heroic spirit of pursuing revolutionary truth is unconquerable

Serious injuries and fatal diseases cannot conquer the revolutionary spirit of pursuing revolutionary truth. A 20-year-old African freedom fighter was honorably wounded in a brave battle against colonial troops. He lay on the sickbed, stubbornly studying Chairman Mao's works. He forgot the pain of his wounds and insisted on recording his study notes. He saw the prospect of victory from Chairman Mao's works and wrote to his comrades on the front line, encouraging them to overcome all difficulties and advance bravely. A friend in Japan, due to a serious illness, has been bedridden for many years. He, with a firm belief in Mao Zedong Thought, persisted in studying Chairman Mao's works until his death. His friends were moved by his indomitable will and expressed their determination to inherit his will and study Chairman Mao's works diligently.

Iron bars cannot block the light of truth. A revolutionary youth in Venezuela was arrested for participating in anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles. He disregarded his personal safety and never forgot to study Mao Zedong Thought. He specially asked his relatives to secretly send two volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" into the prison and studied them diligently. He also cleverly organized his fellow prisoners to take turns reading and discussing. Some revolutionaries, when subjected to severe torture, remained unyielding because they learned the spirit of hard bones and unyielding revolutionary character from Chairman Mao's books.

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries are afraid of the spread of truth. They try every means to block the great Mao Zedong Thought. However, thousands and millions of people, at the risk of their lives, travel everywhere, trying to obtain Chairman Mao's works. In the Soviet Union, where modern revisionism prevails, a worker, after two years of effort, finally obtained the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" he had longed for from a good friend. Some Soviet youths, after studying Chairman Mao's works, wrote to Chairman Mao: "Only your thoughts can save my country." He expressed, "I do not want to be a victim of modern revisionism, but I want to be a true revolutionary!"

Currently, in the wave of studying Chairman Mao's works among revolutionary people of various countries, a new feature has emerged, that is, many revolutionaries have begun to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a motto, as a weapon to transform people's souls. The organ of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), "Vanguard," in calling on Australian Marxist-Leninists and progressives to seriously study the "Three Constantly Read Articles," emphasized that the "Three Constantly Read Articles" have "endless meanings. They indicate that all those who aspire to be true Marxist-Leninists and communists can only be transformed through serving the people and abandoning all selfish individualism in practice." The Chilean "Spartacus" pointed out: "The 'Three Constantly Read Articles' are making millions of ordinary workers understand the revolutionary significance of their work, combining their personal wishes with the interests of the broad masses of the people and the world revolution."

Recently, many Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations in various countries have made decisions and issued instructions, calling on all party members and laborers to "study, master, and universally apply Mao Zedong Thought, and arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought"; calling on them to "study Mao Zedong's works in a planned, organized, and in-depth manner," and to regard it as the party's central task to carry it out. Now, many fraternal parties' broad party members and cadres are studying Chairman Mao's works in an organized manner, which is becoming a trend. In progressive circles around the world, study organizations of Chairman Mao's works are emerging like mushrooms after rain.

While striving to study Chairman Mao's works, revolutionaries around the world are actively and enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought. A patriot in Laos said, "The wider Mao Zedong Thought spreads, the more the world revolution develops." A writer in Thailand pointed out: "Propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought is the responsibility of every revolutionary." Many revolutionaries in various countries volunteer to be honorable "propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought." Young people in Lesotho and Haiti are systematically collecting Chairman Mao's works to establish libraries. Some revolutionaries, under extremely difficult conditions, print Chairman Mao's famous articles into booklets and distribute them widely. Some copy Chairman Mao's quotations and send them to relatives and friends, and some even record the quotations broadcast by Beijing Radio and play them for others to listen to. A writer in Pakistan said: "My greatest wish in life is to translate Mao Zedong's works into Urdu and introduce Mao Zedong Thought to the people of Pakistan. This will be the most meaningful work of my life." A propagandist of the Fiery District Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, in the past two or three years, has read the Albanian version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" many times, often sharing his insights and experiences with workers, soldiers, intellectuals, and cadres in this district, introducing study experiences, and is very welcome. He said: "I study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought with great love for the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao."

Head can be cut off, blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned!

Head can be cut off, blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned! Revolutionary people around the world bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought. Many revolutionaries solemnly vow to Chairman Mao: "As your students, we will forever be loyal to your teachings; like the sunflower facing the sun, we will follow your thoughts." They say: Mao Zedong Thought is "the lifeline of the world's revolutionary people," is "the lifeline of the world revolution." "We must defend Mao Zedong Thought like cherishing the common wealth of all laboring people of the world." "We must cherish it like cherishing our own lives, because it guides us to gain something more precious than life." A Soviet youth in a letter to the beloved Chairman Mao expressed his unshakable determination: "I want to be your soldier. I swear to fight to the end against modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU! I swear to spare no effort, even my life, to fight for the realization of your thoughts in my country! I swear to fight for the revival of true Marxism-Leninism in my country! I firmly believe that your thoughts will definitely become the guiding principles for all work in my country. In the future, all the people of the world will see that the flag of true Marxism-Leninism—your thoughts—will rise over the Kremlin!"

Chairman Mao has wisely pointed out a magnificent revolutionary prospect for all the people of the world. Currently, revolutionary people around the world are following the path indicated by Chairman Mao, fearing no sacrifice, advancing bravely, and thoroughly smashing the heavy shackles on their backs to become the masters of the new era. A bright red new world will definitely be born, following Mao Zedong's magnificent ideal, in the triumphant march of "The East Is Red" and "The Internationale." Workers of the world, unite! People of the world, unite! Hold high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, facing the dawn of victory, and bravely advance towards a brilliant future!

专栏：

    让毛泽东思想红遍全世界
    伟大的毛泽东思想，像熊熊燃烧的火炬，照亮了全球；像漫舞长空的红旗，映遍了世界。毛泽东思想正在掌握全世界亿万革命群众，成为各国人民进行革命斗争的无穷无尽的力量，成为全球上最强大的不可抵御的武器。
    毛泽东思想是人民革命的指南，它引导着世界革命大军沿着正确的斗争轨道，永远朝着胜利的方向前进。
    学习毛泽东思想是革命者头等重要的任务
    许多国家的革命者说，毛泽东思想是“一天也不能缺少的精神食粮”。墨西哥革命者说，学习和运用毛主席著作是“生活的第一需要”。博茨瓦纳人士指出，“学习毛泽东思想是世界上一切革命者的头等重要的任务。”现在，世界上越来越多的革命者怀有这种迫切的要求，一个学习毛主席著作的热潮正在各国兴起。
    许多国家的革命者说，“有了毛主席的书，如鱼得水”。读了毛主席著作，“心里发热，心里亮堂”；“刀山敢上，火海敢闯”。他们说：“毛主席的书千真万确，一字千金”，“句句闪耀着真理的光芒”。他们说：“毛泽东的书就是红色的种子，定会在全世界人民的心中生根、发芽、开花、结果。”他们说：“毛主席的著作是一座巨大的无产阶级革命理论宝库，一定要用毕生的全部精力学习它，运用它。”许多国家的革命者都把毛主席的书当作“革命者手册”，当作“必读教材”。许多人随身带着毛主席著作，遇事学，随时学。非洲许多国家的自由战士从国外返回前线时，不顾长途跋涉，穿过敌人的重重封锁，冒着生命危险，把大批毛主席著作小心翼翼地带进山涧丛林，作为最珍贵的礼物送到亲密的战友手中。战友们一拿到书就亲切地吻着它，立即读起来。
    毛主席著作在国外发行是轰动世界的大喜事
    今天，世界各国革命人民最渴望得到毛主席的书。自从中国开展无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们的这种愿望变得更加强烈。现在，世界上有一百五十多个国家和地区从中国订购毛主席著作。一九六六年，中国出版的毛主席著作在国外的发行量，约等于一九五二年全年的一百倍，是解放以来发行最多的一年。尽管这样，仍然远远不能满足国外广大读者的需要。世界各国人民都纷纷要求增加发行量。许多国家还自己翻译和出版了毛主席著作。据不完全统计，目前有五十多个国家和地区用六十多种文字，翻译和出版了毛主席著作，仅单行本就有六百七十多种。有三十多个国家还出版了《毛泽东选集》。最近，许多兄弟党和马克思列宁主义组织纷纷作出决定，大力加速毛主席著作的翻译和出版工作。有的还专门为此成立了特别委员会，并制订了长远规划。
    最近，《毛主席语录》译成许多文种在国外发行，立即成了轰动世界的大喜事。五大洲的各国革命人民像久旱逢甘霖一样热烈欢呼它，争购它，学习它。西方国家资产阶级报纸惊呼它是“世界上最畅销的书”，是“征服世界的书”。仅在日本，不到一个月的时间，就翻译出版了四种版本的《毛主席语录》，其中一种版本首批五万册很快就一售而空，这在日本图书发行史上是空前的。各国人民得到这本书后都如获珍宝，交口称赞。有的说，“书上的每一句话都飞入了我的心灵。”老挝文艺战士们在得到《毛主席语录》时，激动地表示：“一定要随身带，天天学，宁肯牺牲生命也不丢掉这本书。”许多革命者说，读着《毛主席语录》，就像来到毛主席身旁，就像天天都在听他老人家的教导。
    毛泽东思想给革命人民以斗争的勇气和力量
    全世界多少革命人民怀着强烈的革命豪情，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。多少人捧着“毛主席的宝书”，废寝忘食，爱不释手。多少人带着“毛主席的红书”，在生活中学，在斗争中学。许多国家的解放战士带着毛主席的书，走进深山密林，拿起武器打游击。许多国家的革命者带着毛主席的书，深入穷乡僻野，建立革命根据地。在敌人的监狱里，在白色恐怖下，在死亡威胁前，都有许许多多革命志士以大无畏的革命气魄，孜孜不倦地坚持阅读毛主席著作。他们说，是毛泽东思想给了他们以无穷的斗争智慧、勇气、信心和力量。
    一位拉丁美洲的朋友说得好：“哪里有人民拿起武器，哪里就有毛泽东的教导。”越南、老挝、刚果（利）、莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚、尼加拉瓜和委内瑞拉的解放军和游击队的战士们，在炮声隆隆的阵地上，在硝烟弥漫的战壕里，总是不忘学习毛主席著作。
    一位守卫在老挝前线的爱国防空部队某部指挥员指着富科特山阵地自豪地说：“在这座山上美帝国主义和它的走狗曾倾泻下成千上万吨的炸弹和炮弹，把山上的土层削去了两米，但是它至今仍然屹立着，始终控制在我们英雄人民的手中。这不正如毛主席说的，人的因素第一，决定战争胜负的是人而不是武器吗？”
    非洲喀奔达地区的安哥拉游击队员，常年活跃在无边无际的大密林中，那里地广人稀，阴暗潮湿，环境十分艰苦。但是，他们牢记毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”对胜利就充满了信心。他们油印了毛主席著作，在野营时当作教材，进行政治、军事和文化教育。津巴布韦的自由战士们说，他们的斗争经验证明，某些人的所谓“通过和平道路来取得解放”的陈词滥调已经完全破产，毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的论断绝对正确。
    秘鲁的朋友指出，拉丁美洲革命者正在运用毛主席创造性地制定的先农村后城市，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国胜利的理论。尼加拉瓜革命者在同美帝国主义和本国的反动统治展开的生死的搏斗中，美帝国主义和反动派包围了他们，修正主义者出卖了他们，环境十分险恶，斗争十分艰巨。但是，他们说，每当想起毛主席“星星之火，可以燎原”的论断的时候，他们就增强了信心，鼓起了斗志。
    追求革命真理的雄心是永远征服不了的
    重伤、绝症征服不了革命者追求革命真理的雄心。一位二十岁的非洲自由战士在反对殖民军的英勇战斗中光荣负伤，他躺在病床上顽强地学习毛主席著作。他忘掉了伤口的剧痛，坚持记下学习心得。他从毛主席的著作中看到了胜利的前景，写信告诉前线的战友，激励他们排除万难，奋勇前进。日本有一位朋友因患重病而卧床多年，他怀着对毛泽东思想的坚强信念，坚持不懈地学习毛主席著作，直到临死。他的朋友们为他这种坚韧不拔的毅力所感动，表示要继承他的遗志，刻苦学习毛主席著作。
    铁窗也挡不了真理的光芒。委内瑞拉一位革命青年，因为参加反美反独裁斗争而被捕入狱。他置个人安危于度外，念念不忘学习毛泽东思想。他特意托他的亲人将两卷《毛泽东选集》私下送进监狱，勤奋地攻读。他还巧妙地把狱中难友组织起来，轮流阅读，并且进行讨论。有的革命者在遭到严刑拷打时，坚贞不屈，因为他们从毛主席的书中学到了硬骨头的精神，学到了威武不屈的革命情操。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，都害怕真理的传播，它们千方百计地妄图封锁伟大的毛泽东思想。但是，千千万万的人民却冒着风险，到处奔波，设法获得毛主席的著作。在现代修正主义当道的苏联，有一位工人，经过两年的努力，终于从一位好友那里得到了他梦寐以求的《毛泽东选集》。有的苏联青年在学习毛主席著作后写信给毛主席说：“只有您的思想才能拯救我的祖国。”他表示，“不愿做现代修正主义的牺牲品，而要做一名真正的革命者！”
    革命人民把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学
    当前，在各国革命人民学习毛主席著作的热潮中出现了新的特点，这就是许多革命者开始把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，当作改造人们灵魂的武器来学。澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》在号召澳大利亚马克思列宁主义者和进步人士认真学习“老三篇”时强调指出，“老三篇”的“含意无穷，它们指明，一切立志成为真正的马克思列宁主义者和共产党人的人们，只有通过为人民服务和抛开一切自私的个人主义的实践才能够得到改造”。智利《斯巴达克报》载文指出：“老三篇”“正在使千千万万普通劳动者懂得了他们工作的革命意义，把他们的个人愿望与广大人民群众和世界革命的利益结合起来。”
    最近，许多国家的马克思列宁主义政党和组织都纷纷作出决定和发出指示，号召全体党员和劳动人民“学习、精通和普遍运用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装自己”；号召他们要“有计划地有组织地深入地学习毛泽东著作”，并且把它“当作党的中心任务来执行”。现在，许多兄弟党的广大党员和干部有组织地学习毛主席著作正在蔚然成风。在世界各地的进步人士中，毛主席著作的学习组织也像雨后春笋般地涌现出来。
    宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想是每个革命者的责任
    世界各地的革命者在努力学习毛主席著作的同时，积极热情地宣传毛泽东思想。老挝的一位爱国者说，毛泽东思想“传播越广，世界革命就越发展”。泰国一位作家指出：“宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想是每个革命者的责任。”各国有许多革命者志愿作一名光荣的“毛泽东思想宣传员”。莱索托和海地的青年们正在有计划地收集毛主席著作，准备成立图书馆。有些国家的革命者在非常困难的条件下把毛主席的一些著名文章油印成册，广泛散发。有的誊抄毛主席语录寄送给乡亲好友，有的还把北京电台广播的毛主席语录录下音来再放给别人听。巴基斯坦一位作家说：“我平生最大的志愿就是把毛泽东著作译成乌尔都文，向巴基斯坦人民介绍毛泽东思想。这将是我毕生最有意义的工作。”阿尔巴尼亚劳动党发罗拉区委会的一位宣传员近两、三年内，通读了阿尔巴尼亚文版的《毛泽东选集》，多次向这个区的工人、军人、知识分子和干部谈心得、讲体会，介绍学习经验，很受欢迎。他说：“我是怀着对中国共产党和毛主席的巨大热爱来学习和宣传毛泽东思想的。”
    头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢
    头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不能丢！世界革命人民勇敢地捍卫毛泽东思想。许多革命者向毛主席庄严宣誓：“作为您的学生，我们永远忠于您的教导；像葵花向阳那样，追随您的思想。”他们说：毛泽东思想是“世界革命人民的命根子”，是“世界革命的生命线”。“我们必须像爱护全世界劳动人民的共同财富一样来捍卫毛泽东思想。”“我们必须像爱护自己的生命一样爱护它，因为它引导我们获得比生命还宝贵的东西。”一个苏联青年在一封信中，向敬爱的毛主席倾诉了他那坚定不移的决心：“我想成为您的战士。我宣誓为反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义而奋斗到底！我宣誓不惜一切力量，甚至生命，为您的思想在我国的实现而奋斗！我宣誓为真正的马克思列宁主义在我国复兴而奋斗！我坚信您的思想一定会成为我国各项工作的指针。将来，全世界人民一定会看到，在克里姆林宫上空升起真正的马克思列宁主义——您的思想的旗帜！”毛主席给全世界人民
    指明了壮丽的革命前景
    毛主席在致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会贺电中指出：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，就是一个有力的证明。欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”
    毛主席英明地给全世界人民指明了壮丽的革命前景。目前，全世界革命人民正在沿着毛主席指引的道路，不怕牺牲，前赴后继，要彻底粉碎压在他们身上的沉重枷锁，成为新时代的主人。一个红彤彤的崭新的世界必将按照毛泽东宏伟的理想，在《东方红》和《国际歌》雄壮的凯歌声中诞生。全世界无产者联合起来！全世界人民团结起来！高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，迎着胜利的曙光，朝着光辉灿烂的前程，奋勇前进！
