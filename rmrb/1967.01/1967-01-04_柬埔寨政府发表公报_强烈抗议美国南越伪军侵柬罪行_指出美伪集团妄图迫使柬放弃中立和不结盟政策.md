	Cambodian Government Issues Statement
	Strongly Protesting U.S.-South Vietnamese Puppet Army's Invasion of Cambodia
	Accusing the U.S.-Puppet Group of Attempting to Force Cambodia to Abandon Its Neutral and Non-Aligned Policy

	BEIJING, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) - The Cambodian News Agency on Jan. 2 released a statement from the Royal Government of Cambodia strongly protesting the invasion of Battambang Province's Bat Village by the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet army on Dec. 30 last year.

	The statement said the Royal Government strongly protests this deliberate large-scale invasion by the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet army. The Royal Government points out that the victimized Bat Village had already suffered savage bombing by South Vietnamese puppet airplanes on Oct. 15, 1965, resulting in heavy casualties and substantial material losses. Fourteen months later, the invaders once again wantonly attacked this peaceful village. This is part of the long-term policy of pressure and intimidation imposed on Cambodia by the authorities in Washington and Saigon to force the Kingdom of Cambodia to abandon its strict policy of neutrality and non-alignment.

	The statement said the Royal Government, therefore, calls on all countries that, like Cambodia, uphold justice and love peace to strongly protest the evil policy of the United States and the South Vietnamese puppet army against a peaceful and neutral country with only limited defensive means. The statement also said the Royal Government emphasizes that if there is another invasion like the one on Dec. 30, it will have the most serious consequences, because it is clear that the massacre of innocent residents on the Cambodian border cannot be tolerated. In any case, the U.S. and South Vietnamese authorities must bear full responsibility for the consequences of their army's bloody invasion of Bat Village.

	The Cambodian newspaper "New Telegraph" on Jan. 2 published an editorial on the invasion of Bat Village by the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet army on Dec. 30 last year, saying: "This is a blatant act of aggression, the most brutal and shameless provocation and intimidation plot to date."

	The editorial stressed: "Many very sufficient reasons and beneficial experiences have made the Cambodian people clearly understand that one cannot wait for (nor expect) the 'reason' and 'kindness' of the U.S. government and its lackeys. To yield to the provocation and intimidation plots of the Americans and their running dogs is, for a person and an independent nation, equivalent to signing one's own death warrant." The editorial said the Cambodian people will not be manipulated by others; they are doubling their vigilance and have tenfold the courage to deal with the enemy's evil activities. No force can shake their determination to fight against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

    柬埔寨政府发表公报
    强烈抗议美国南越伪军侵柬罪行
    指出美伪集团妄图迫使柬放弃中立和不结盟政策
    新华社金边二日电　柬埔寨新闻社二日发表柬埔寨王国政府公报，强烈抗议美国—南越伪军去年十二月三十日侵略柴桢省巴图村的罪行。
    公报说，王国政府对美国—南越伪军蓄意进行的这次大规模侵略提出最强烈的抗议。王国政府要指出，受害的巴图村在一九六五年十月十五日已经遭受过南越伪军飞机的野蛮轰炸，造成了大批的居民伤亡和重大的物质损失。事隔十四个月，侵略者又再次肆意袭击这个和平村庄，这是华盛顿和西贡当局为了迫使柬埔寨王国放弃自己严格中立和不结盟政策而长期对柬埔寨实行的高压和恫吓政策的一部分。
    公报说，王国政府为此呼吁所有像柬埔寨一样主持正义和热爱和平的国家强烈抗议美国和南越伪军对一个只有少量防御手段的和平与中立国家实行这种罪恶的政策。公报还说，王国政府强调指出，再次发生类似十二月三十日的侵略，必将引起最严重的后果，因为很显然，不能容许继续屠杀柬埔寨边境无辜的居民。在任何情况下，美国和南越当局必须对它们的军队对巴图村的血腥侵略所引起的后果承担全部责任。
    柬埔寨《新电讯报》二日就美国—南越伪军去年十二月三十日侵略巴图村的罪行发表社论说：“这是不折不扣的侵略行动，是迄今为止最粗暴和最无耻的挑衅和恫吓阴谋。”
    社论强调指出：“许多十分充足的理由和有益的经验使柬埔寨人民清楚地懂得，决不能等待（也不能期望）美国政府及其仆从的‘理智’和‘仁慈’。屈服于美国佬及其走狗的挑衅和恫吓阴谋，对于一个人和独立的民族来说，就等于在自己的死刑判决书上签了字。”社论说，柬埔寨人民决不会听人摆布，他们正在加倍提高警惕，有十倍的勇气来对付敌人的罪恶活动。任何力量都动摇不了他们同美帝国主义及其走狗进行斗争的决心。
