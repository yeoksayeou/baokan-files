After reading the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels' "Open Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and the editorial note from the *People's Daily*, we are filled with immense excitement. The issues discussed here are exactly what we have personally experienced; the principles explained are precisely what we have deeply felt. This extremely important document is the strongest support and encouragement for us revolutionary rebels, and it is the most ruthless exposure and strike against the handful of capitalists within the party and the few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line.

When the movement began, the handful of capitalists within our factory who were in power and those who implemented the bourgeois reactionary line also used the name of "focusing on production" to suppress the revolution. They used various labels to prevent us from rising up in revolution. However, we revolutionary rebel workers are truly fearless, unafraid of pressure, unafraid of threats, unafraid of ghosts, and unafraid of demons. We resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "concern yourselves with state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." We resolutely rose up in revolution and resolutely rebelled against the capitalists within the party who were in power, igniting a blazing revolutionary fire within the factory. This made them panic and hurriedly incite workers inside and outside the factory who had been deceived to attack us. We were still unafraid and stood our ground. They then incited a large number of workers in the factory to leave their production posts, attempting to pin the blame for disrupting production on us revolutionary rebel workers. In December last year, almost all the cadres in the factory had left, including cooks, managers, and medical staff. Heavy difficulties lay before us. What should we do? We revolutionary rebel workers listen to Chairman Mao the most, care about the revolution the most, and also care about production the most. We resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and with the strong support of students who came to the factory to participate in the revolution, we resolutely shouldered the burdens of both revolution and production. Revolution, we will do it! Production, we will do it too! You leave the production posts, and we will firmly hold onto them.

With fewer people, heavier tasks, and greater difficulties, we drew strength from Chairman Mao's works to overcome these challenges. No matter how busy the work and production were, we insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works every day. The invincible and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought gave us boundless strength. We broke down the boundaries between all workshops, shifts, and job categories and work sequences in the entire factory. Wherever there was a need, we went there; wherever there was a difficulty, we went there. Take our factory's assembly shift as an example! Previously, four people assembled the differential of a car, but three left, leaving only worker Luo Ji. What should be done? Luo Ji is a revolutionary rebel. He remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "No matter how difficult and arduous the situation, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight." Therefore, he took on the work of four people. In December last year, he completed the production plan for his shift ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. Many revolutionary rebel workers worked during the day to ensure production and guarded the factory at night, even giving up their Sundays. After more than twenty days of arduous struggle, we successfully completed the car repair tasks for December 1966 ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. This is the victory of insisting on "grasping revolution and promoting production"; this is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

After reading the central government's congratulatory telegram to the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels, the editorials from the *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine, our vision is clearer, our hearts are brighter, and our spirit is stronger. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," resolutely unite with all revolutionary rebels, rally the majority of revolutionary masses, resolutely smash any new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line in any form, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

    坚决挑起革命和生产两副担子
    看了上海革命造反派《告上海全市人民书》和《人民日报》的编者按，我们无比激动。因为这里讲的事情，正是我们亲身经历过的；这里讲的道理，也正是我们切身体会到的。这个极其重要的文件，是对我们革命造反派的最有力的支持和鼓舞，是对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的人最无情的揭露和打击。
    运动开始的时候，我们厂里的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和执行资产阶级反动路线的人，也是以“抓生产”之名，行压革命之实，用种种大帽子，不准我们起来革命。但是我们革命造反派的工人，真正是不怕压，不怕逼，不怕鬼，不怕魅，我们坚决响应毛主席的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的号召，坚决起来革命，坚决造了党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，在厂里点起了熊熊的革命烈火。这样一来，他们慌了手脚，连忙煽动厂内外被蒙蔽的工人来围攻我们。我们同样不怕，给顶住了。他们又煽动厂里大批职工离开生产岗位，妄图把破坏生产的罪名压在我们革命造反派工人的身上。去年十二月，厂里的干部几乎都走光了，连炊事员、管理员、医务人员也都走了，重重困难摆在我们面前，怎么办？我们革命造反派的工人最听毛主席的话，最关心革命，也最关心生产，我们坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在来厂参加革命的学生有力的支持下，坚决把革命和生产的担子同时挑起来。革命，由我们干！生产也由我们干！你们离开生产岗位，我们就坚守生产岗位。
    人少，任务重，困难大，我们就从毛主席的著作中汲取克服困难的力量，不管工作、生产多么紧张，每天坚持学习毛主席著作。战无不胜的光芒万丈的毛泽东思想给了我们无穷无尽的力量。我们打破了全厂各车间、班组和工种、工序的界限，哪里需要，就到哪里，哪里困难，就到哪里。就拿我们厂的装配班来说吧！过去装配汽车差速器是四个人，走了三个，只剩下工人罗吉。怎么办？罗吉是革命造反派，他想起毛主席的教导：“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”因此，四个人的活由他一个人顶起来，去年十二月份提前超额完成了班组的生产计划。许多革命造反派的工人都是白天坚持生产，晚上守卫工厂，连星期天也放弃了休息。这样经过二十多天的艰苦奋斗，终于出色地提前超额完成了一九六六年十二月的修车任务。这是坚持“抓革命，促生产”的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    读了中央给上海革命造反派的贺电，《人民日报》和《红旗》杂志的社论，我们的眼更明，心更亮，劲更足了。我们要坚决响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，坚决联合一切革命造反派，团结大多数革命群众，坚决粉碎资产阶级反动路线任何形式的新反扑，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
