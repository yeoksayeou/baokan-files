The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have smashed the plot of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and a few stubborn individuals who persistently implement the bourgeois reactionary line. This plot aimed to stop water, electricity, and transportation, and halt work at the port. They have dealt a heavy blow to the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Facts have proven that the counterrevolutionary economicist black wind was stirred up by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and those who stubbornly persist in implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. This is a manifestation of their desperate struggle. In mid-December last year, they spread black words such as "economic issues can be set aside," "wage standards can be breached," and "institutions must be broken quickly." Recently, under their instructions, some units in Shanghai where the capitalist-roaders are in power have used vile means such as large-scale wage evaluations, indiscriminate issuance of subsidies, and chaotic so-called "welfare projects" to squander state funds. They use material wealth as bait to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, split the revolutionary ranks, shift the direction of the cultural revolution struggle, oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, sabotage the cultural revolution, and disrupt production. Under the plotting of these scoundrels, some department and factory leaders who take the capitalist road have, under the guise of revolutionary "linking up," issued linking-up subsidies, causing many production workers to leave their posts. They deliberately aimed to create a serious situation of stopping water, electricity, and transportation in the entire city to oppose Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," to put pressure on the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and attempt to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and block the advance of the cultural revolution's torrent.

The revolutionary rebels and masses of Shanghai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have given a resolute counterattack to the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and achieved one victory after another.

The revolutionary rebels of the various loading and unloading areas of the Shanghai Port Administration Bureau, who are holding high Chairman Mao's banner of "grasp revolution, promote production," dare to defy the wind and dare to take on heavy responsibilities. They unite revolutionary workers to resolutely fight against the bourgeois reactionary line and have smashed the big plot of "port shutdown" orchestrated by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee.

Shanghai Port is the hub for the inflow and outflow of materials and commodities in the Shanghai region. Port loading and unloading operations are related not only to industrial production and people's livelihood but also to international trade. At the end of December last year, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the North China District Maritime Administration and the Shanghai Port Administration Bureau, along with a few who stubbornly implement the bourgeois reactionary line, continued to implement the bourgeois reactionary line of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee. They stirred up a strange wind, signing agreements and promising material incentives such as back pay and promotions to buy off and soften the workers, shifting the direction of the struggle. In this process, they also played extremely vile tricks, approving some and disapproving others, deliberately creating contradictions among the masses and disrupting unity. They incited workers to demand wages and benefits, causing them to leave their production posts and resulting in a serious "port shutdown" incident.

Under the onslaught of this strange wind, the revolutionary rebels fear neither heaven nor earth, are not swayed by wealth, and are not intimidated by force. They firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, are not moved by money, and are not afraid of the backlash. The revolutionary rebel organizations in various loading and unloading areas have, through various forms, propagated to the broad masses of workers, exposing the new plots of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party. They persuaded everyone to prioritize revolutionary interests and the overall situation, to never fall for the counterrevolutionary economicist trap, and to never shift the direction of the struggle. Many rebel team members took the lead in guarding their production posts, fearlessly facing the attacks of a few malicious elements, and day and night boarded ships to patiently persuade and educate the worker masses who were temporarily deceived and wanted to go north. Many workers, after propaganda and education, saw clearly, raised their awareness, and returned to their production posts in droves.

The plots of a few bourgeois masters will never succeed. On January 8, the loading and unloading areas that had once stopped work for the anchored foreign ships, with the support of revolutionary students from Fudan University, Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Maritime University, and the First Medical College, have all resumed normal loading and unloading operations. The big plot of "port shutdown" orchestrated by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee has been thoroughly foiled. These masters have met a shameful end. In recent days, many loading and unloading areas have held meetings to struggle against those in power who sabotage national interests and madly promote counterrevolutionary economicism. Old workers not only returned the money they received to the state but also angrily exposed the new plots and crimes of these masters. They said, "We workers want revolution, not money! Money cannot buy the red hearts of our revolutionary rebels! We must follow Chairman Mao's words, grasp both revolution and production, and definitely carry both burdens well!"

The revolutionary rebels of the Shanghai Railway Bureau have united with the broad revolutionary masses to quickly restore the transport order, making the once basically interrupted Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines rapidly resume operations, thoroughly smashing the plot of a few reactionaries to stop water, electricity, and transportation.

At the end of last month, when the revolutionary rebels and masses of the entire city launched a general offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Railway Bureau and those who stubbornly implement the bourgeois reactionary line played new tricks, causing the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing lines to basically stop cargo trains and run very few passenger trains, causing serious losses to the national economy.

The revolutionary rebels of the Shanghai Railway Bureau were very indignant about this situation. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose" and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They united with the broad revolutionary masses and decided to resume railway transportation at 18:00 on the afternoon of the 9th.

The comrades of various rebel fighting teams and small groups of the Shanghai Railway Bureau remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "no matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." They united with the surrounding revolutionary masses and actively responded to the decision of the revolutionary rebels to resume railway transportation. The revolutionary rebels of the locomotive section ensured that there were people for every need, cars for every need, and were ready to set out at any time, firmly completing the transportation tasks assigned by the party and the state under any circumstances. Some rebel team members, upon hearing that the train lacked assistant drivers and firemen, immediately volunteered to take over these positions. Many workers, in order to run more trains, showed a spirit of fearlessness of fatigue and continuous fighting, going without meals for several shifts and without sleep for several nights, taking over various jobs. The revolutionary rebels of the electrical section held high the banner of revolution, united a group of revolutionary masses, firmly guarded their production posts, overcame various difficulties, and made the railway's communication, signal, telegraph, and telephone "nervous centers" the first to return to normal, creating important conditions for the entire line to resume transportation.

The revolutionary rebels of the Yangshupu Power Plant, when a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party and a few who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line were stirring up a counterrevolutionary revisionist economicist black wind, united with the broad revolutionary masses. They resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution, promote production," firmly guarded their posts, and ensured normal power supply.

The revolutionary rebels of the heart of this plant—the boiler, steam turbine, and generator operation departments—often read Chairman Mao's quotations at pre-shift meetings: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance." They firmly guarded their production posts, seriously raised their revolutionary vigilance, prevented the sabotage of class enemies, and ensured safe operation. The revolutionary rebels and workers of this plant resolutely declared: They must ensure normal operation and not miss a single degree of electricity! They must smash the new challenges of the bourgeois reactionary line with fighting actions.

The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai are further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning the congratulatory telegrams from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the editorials of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, and important documents such as the "Letter to the People of the Whole City of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice." Their fighting spirit is becoming more and more ardent, and they are also highly alert to the new moves of the class enemy, determined to thoroughly smash any new plots played by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai region and those who stubbornly implement the bourgeois reactionary line.

    高举毛主席革命路线的伟大旗帜　打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑
    上海革命造反派痛击经济主义获重大胜利
    广大革命职工坚守战斗岗位挑起革命和生产两副重担
    新华社上海十六日电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的上海革命造反派，在工业交通战线上，粉碎了上海地区一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人策划的停水、停电、停交通和海港停工等大阴谋，迎头痛击了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    大量事实证明，反革命的经济主义黑风，是上海市委一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的人刮起来的。这是他们垂死挣扎的表现。去年十二月中旬，他们散布了“经济问题可以放”，“工资标准可以冲”，“制度要破得快”等等黑话和发布了一些黑指示。最近以来，在他们的指使下，上海一些单位走资本主义道路的当权派，用大搞评薪定级，滥发补助费，乱搞所谓“福利事业”等卑劣的手段，大慷国家之慨，以物质金钱为诱饵，腐蚀革命群众的战斗意志，分化革命队伍，转移文化革命的斗争大方向，对抗毛主席的革命路线，破坏文化大革命，破坏生产。在这一小撮家伙的阴谋策划下，有些机关、工厂的走资本主义道路的当权派还以革命“大串连”为名，大发串连补助费，致使许多生产工人纷纷离开生产岗位。他们有意要在全市造成停水、停电、停交通的严重事件，以对抗毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，向中央文革小组施加压力，企图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，阻拦文化大革命的洪流前进。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海革命造反派和革命群众对资产阶级反动路线的新反扑给予迎头痛击，取得一个又一个胜利。
    战斗在上海港口的上海港务管理局各装卸区革命造反派，高举毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的大旗，敢于顶逆风，敢于挑大梁，团结革命职工，同资产阶级反动路线作坚决的斗争，粉碎了上海市委里面一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派一手制造的“海港停工”大阴谋。
    上海港口是上海地区物资、商品的吞吐口。港口装卸作业不仅关系到工业生产和人民生活，还关系到国际贸易。去年十二月下旬，北方区海运管理局和所属上海港务管理局一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，继续执行上海市委资产阶级反动路线，刮起一股妖风，签字许愿，以补发工资、提高级别等物质刺激为诱饵，阴谋收买和软化工人，转移斗争的大方向，把一场严肃的政治斗争引到经济主义的歧路上去。在这过程中，他们还玩弄了极其恶劣的手法，批准这一批，不批准那一批，故意在群众中制造矛盾，破坏群众的团结。他们挑动工人闹工资福利，离开了生产岗位，造成了严重的“海港停工”事件。
    在这一股妖风袭击下，革命造反派天不怕，地不怕，富贵不能淫，威武不能屈。他们牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，不为金钱所动，不怕逆流冲击。各装卸区的革命造反组织，通过各种形式向广大职工进行宣传，揭穿一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的新阴谋，说服大家以革命利益为重，以全局为重，绝不上反革命的经济主义的当，绝不转移斗争的大方向。许多造反队员带头坚守生产岗位，不怕一小撮别有用心的坏分子的围攻，日夜登轮，向一些一时受了蒙蔽登上轮船要北上的工人群众进行耐心的说服教育工作。不少工人经过宣传教育，擦亮了眼睛，提高了认识，纷纷回到了生产岗位。
    一小撮资产阶级老爷们的阴谋是永远不会得逞的。一月八日，一度停工的停泊外轮的各装卸区，在复旦、交大、同济、海运、一医等大专院校革命同学的支援下，都已经恢复正常的装卸工作。上海市委里面一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派制造的“海港停工”大阴谋彻底破产了。这些老爷们得到了一个可耻的下场。连日来，许多装卸区的革命职工，纷纷召开大会，对那些破坏国家利益，丧心病狂地推行反革命的经济主义的当权派，进行斗争。老工人们不仅把拿到的钱退还国家，还愤怒地控诉了这些老爷们的新的阴谋和罪行。他们说：“我们工人要的是革命，不是钞票！”“金钱买不了我们革命造反派的红心！”“我们要听毛主席的话，一手抓革命，一手抓生产，一定要把这两副担子都挑好！”
　　铁路局上海分局革命造反派的工人团结广大革命职工，及时扭转运输秩序，使一度基本上中断的沪宁、沪杭两线运输迅速恢复，彻底粉碎了一小撮反动家伙策划的停水、停电、停交通的阴谋。
    上月底，正当全市革命造反派和革命群众向资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击的时候，铁路局上海分局党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，耍出了新的花招，使沪杭、沪宁两线，货车基本停开，客车也开得很少，给国家经济带来了严重的损失。
    上海分局的革命造反派对这一情况十分气愤。他们遵照毛主席的“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对”的教导，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，团结广大革命职工，毅然决定在九日下午十八时恢复铁路运输。
    铁路局上海分局各造反战斗兵团和战斗小组的同志，牢记毛主席的“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去”的教导，团结周围革命群众，积极响应革命造反派提出的恢复铁路运输的决定。机务段革命造反派的工人保证做到要人有人，有车有人，随时做好出发的准备，在任何情况下，都坚决完成党和国家交给的运输任务。有的造反队队员听到列车缺少副司机、司炉工，立即自告奋勇，顶替了这些岗位。还有许多工人为了争取多开一辆车，发挥了不怕疲劳，连续作战的精神，接连好几顿不吃饭，好几夜不睡觉，顶替各种工作。电务段的革命造反派高举革命的旗帜，团结一批革命群众，坚守生产岗位，排除各种困难，使铁路通讯、信号、电报、电话这些“神经中枢”首先恢复正常，为整个线路恢复运输创造了重要条件。
    杨树浦发电厂的革命造反派，在一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人大刮反革命修正主义的经济主义阴风的时候，团结广大革命职工，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，严守岗位，保证正常供电。
    这个厂的心脏——锅炉、汽轮机、发电机运行部门的革命造反派，在班前会上，经常朗读毛主席语录：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”他们坚守生产岗位，认真提高革命警惕，严防阶级敌人的破坏，保证安全运转。这个厂的革命造反派和革命职工坚决表示：一定要保证正常运转，决不缺一度电！一定要以战斗行动粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新挑战。
    上海革命造反派正在进一步活学活用毛主席著作，学习中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组的贺电，《人民日报》《红旗》杂志社论和《告上海全市人民书》、《紧急通告》等重要文件。他们的斗志越来越昂扬，同时百倍警惕地注视着阶级敌人的新动向，决心彻底粉碎上海地区一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人耍弄的任何新阴谋。
