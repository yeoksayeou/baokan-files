The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published an editorial on January 26, enthusiastically hailing the participation of all Chinese peasants in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as another victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The editorial said, the proletarian revolutionary masses of the whole of China are continuing to enthusiastically respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and are uniting under the banner of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line to fight against the bourgeois reactionary line. This has created a new situation for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The example set by the revolutionary organizations of Shanghai in grasping and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on "grasp revolution, promote production" is spreading widely. It is not only a model for workers and students to learn from, but also a model for all Chinese peasants to learn from.

The editorial said, the second "Declaration to the People of the Whole City of Shanghai" issued by the Shanghai revolutionary organizations has great significance for the further development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, because it calls on the people of the whole city to firmly support the revolutionary peasant movement, thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism, and thus strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and put the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist economy firmly in the hands of the revolutionary masses in cities and countryside.

The editorial said, the rise of the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai, its actions and general direction are completely correct. The Shanghai revolutionary organizations faithfully follow the teachings and revolutionary line of Comrade Mao Zedong, stand up to defend the revolution, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat and the future of Chinese socialism, and oppose the handful of people in the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who implement the bourgeois reactionary line. A handful of people who have usurped the leadership of the Party are trying to spread counter-revolutionary economism to the countryside, but the revolutionary workers and peasants of Shanghai have given a powerful blow to the counter-revolutionary economism of the revisionists.

The editorial concluded by saying, the rise of the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai and the call of the Shanghai revolutionary workers clearly show that the movement of revolutionary workers, students, and peasants is developing into a surging, mighty movement, and is becoming a powerful striking force, launching a resolute general offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line. We are very pleased with this new upsurge and new achievement in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The great Chinese people, united around the great leader and outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, will forever march forward to victory.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》欢呼我国革命农民运动的兴起
　　革命造反派大联合气势磅礴力量大
    新华社地拉那二十六日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十六日发表编辑部文章，热烈欢呼全中国农民参加无产阶级文化大革命是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一胜利。
    文章说，全中国无产阶级革命群众正继续热烈响应中共中央、国务院、中央军委和中央文革小组的号召，在毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线的旗帜指引下，联合起来，同资产阶级反动路线进行斗争。这为无产阶级文化大革命创造了一种新的形势。上海革命组织在掌握和运用毛泽东同志关于“抓革命，促生产”的教导方面所树立的榜样正在广为传播，它不仅成为工人和学生学习的榜样，而且成为全中国农民学习的榜样。
    文章说，上海革命组织的第二个《告上海全市人民书》对于胜利地进一步发展中国无产阶级文化大革命具有伟大的意义，因为它呼吁全市人民坚决支持革命农民运动，彻底摧毁反革命经济主义，从而加强工农联盟，加强无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义经济的命运紧紧地掌握在城乡革命群众的手里。
    文章说，上海农民革命运动的兴起，它的行动和大方向是完全正确的。上海革命组织忠实地遵循毛泽东同志的教导和革命路线，起来保卫革命，保卫无产阶级专政和中国社会主义的未来，反对上海市委的一小撮执行资产阶级反动路线的人。一小撮篡夺了党的领导权的人企图把反革命经济主义散布到农村中去，但是上海的革命工人和农民给了修正主义者的反革命经济主义以有力的打击。
    文章最后说，上海革命农民运动的兴起和上海革命工人的呼吁清楚地表明，革命工人、学生和农民的运动正在发展为一个汹涌澎湃、气势磅礴的运动，正在变为一支强大的打击力量，对资产阶级反动路线发起坚定性的总攻击。我们对中国无产阶级文化大革命的这一新高涨和新成就十分高兴。团结在伟大的领袖、杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志周围的伟大的中国人民，将永远阔步胜利前进。
