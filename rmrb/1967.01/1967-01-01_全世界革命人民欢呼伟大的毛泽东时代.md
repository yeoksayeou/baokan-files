The red sun rising from the East, casting its golden rays over the boiling earth. This red sun is the great Mao Zedong, and the dazzling golden rays are the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. All true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world unanimously praise: the great Chairman Mao is the most outstanding proletarian revolutionary of our time, the greatest genius; the great Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary communist ideological system, a revolutionary truth applicable everywhere. In today's world, Chairman Mao's prestige is the highest, and the power of Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest. In this era where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory, the glorious name of Mao Zedong is the symbol of the times. The revolutionary people of the world are cheering: our era is the era of Mao Zedong, the era of establishing Mao Zedong Thought, the era of advancing the world revolution under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has shaken the globe and further awakened the revolutionary people of the world. It calls for overthrowing imperialism, overthrowing modern revisionism, sweeping away all harmful elements, and building a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and exploitation. The five continents and four oceans are singing the praises of "The East Is Red," waving the banners of Mao Zedong Thought, and surging with the magnificent waves of revolution.

Chairman Mao—The Red Sun in the Hearts of a Billion People

A comrade from Vietnam, standing on the frontline of the anti-American struggle, recently wrote a passionate poem expressing his and the world's people's deepest love for the great Chairman Mao. In the poem, he sings:

Chairman Mao,
The red sun in the hearts of a billion people,
The helmsman of revolution,
The beloved leader of the world's proletariat,
The greatest Marxist of our time,
The genius strategist.
He is invincible in a hundred battles,
And revolution is inseparable from him.
His thoughts are stronger than the forest of guns and the sea of swords.
He has forged millions of heroes,
Fighting on the five continents and four oceans.
All oppressed peoples of the world want to rebel, all oppressed nations want liberation, and all proletarians want to smash the old world and dare to change the heavens and the earth. More and more revolutionaries around the world are rallying under the banner of Mao Zedong, rallying under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stirring up the world revolution, and sweeping away all harmful elements, invincible. They unanimously say: Mao Zedong, only Mao Zedong, is the undisputed, rightful great teacher of the world's revolutionary people.

Today, in every corner of the world—from the war-torn Asia to the flames of Africa, from the sparks of Latin America to the burning North America, Western Europe, and Oceania, millions of people look up to China, look up to Beijing, look up to the wise helmsman Mao Zedong with boundless love and longing. They bless Chairman Mao with the strongest revolutionary feelings and praise him with the most vivid language. They say: Chairman Mao is the "lighthouse of the vast revolutionary sea," the "torch of human hope," the "banner of victory," the "dawn of the new era"; they say: Chairman Mao is the "brave defender of the world's red thoughts," the "guide of the world's revolutionary people," the "greatest and most respected figure in the world"; they say: Chairman Mao is the "most loyal and conscious servant of the world's people," the "great friend and protector of the oppressed peoples of all countries," the "greatest thinker in history who has benefited humanity."

The world's people have expressed their unlimited trust and deep respect for Chairman Mao. In the entire history of humanity, no one has enjoyed such absolute and exalted prestige among seven hundred million Chinese people, and has gained such high and profound trust from billions of people around the world. The people of the world thank Chairman Mao for showing them new truths, opening new paths; thank Chairman Mao for opening a new chapter in history, creating unparalleled great achievements for the world revolution.

Following Mao Zedong, the World Turns Red

Revolutionaries around the world firmly believe: following Mao Zedong, the world turns red. This is because:

It is Chairman Mao who "has an iron-willed revolutionary spirit, a crystal-clear class sentiment, and a lighthouse-like brilliant thought."

It is Chairman Mao who "has taken up the revolutionary torch from Marx and Lenin, illuminating the forward path for the revolutionary people of the world and the national liberation revolutions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."

It is Chairman Mao who "has gone through such a long and complex struggle, led the Chinese people to overcome countless domestic and foreign enemies, and has such a close connection with the people."

It is Chairman Mao who "at a time when revisionism is rampant, creatively defended the Marxist-Leninist doctrine" and "raised Marxism-Leninism to a higher stage of development."

It is Chairman Mao who "not only theoretically explained that the broadest masses of people in the world have the right to rebel, but more importantly, guided their struggles, provided them with strategic weapons, supported them materially, and inspired them spiritually."

It is Chairman Mao who, with a global vision and far-sightedness, "day and night envisions the most beautiful future for humanity" and "points out a brilliant future for the world's revolutionaries."

The proletarians and revolutionary people of the world proudly say: "Mao Zedong belongs to you, and he also belongs to us; he belongs to the revolutionary people of the whole world!" A national liberation warrior from North Kalimantan solemnly pointed out, "Without Mao Zedong, there would be no new world." A friend from Ceylon shouted: "The oppressed people need Mao Zedong!" A friend from Algeria shouted: "The people of the world need Mao Zedong!" A peace activist from Burma firmly said, with Mao Zedong, "we have unshakable confidence and fear nothing." The workers of Congo (Brazzaville) and the young warriors of Laos, the writers of India and the reporters of Zimbabwe, the famous figures of Japan and the social activists of Latin America, and countless other revolutionaries, from every battlefield, enthusiastically cheered: "In our era, having such an outstanding leader as Mao Zedong is the greatest happiness for the people of the world!" "We are proud and honored to live in the era of Mao Zedong."

Chairman Mao's Heart Beats with the World's People

Chairman Mao's heart beats with the world's people. He is always with the world's people, sharing their fate and breath. The people of various countries say, Mao Zedong, the "great teacher of world revolution," the "eternal red sun in the hearts of the people of all countries," he "cares most about the sufferings of the world's people," "understands most the wishes of the world's people," "believes most in the strength of the world's people," and "supports most the struggles of the world's people." In various places around the world, how many suffering and struggling people, how many people who sacrifice for liberation, how many people who struggle for a new society, all day and night, they miss Chairman Mao. In the summer of 1966, after the news of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River spread, the revolutionary people of various countries were overjoyed and enthusiastically cheered for Chairman Mao's longevity and health. When several documentary films of Chairman Mao receiving the Cultural Revolution army composed of Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers from all over the country were shown in various countries, they attracted a wide audience. Many foreign friends saw on the screen that Chairman Mao was radiant and full of vigor, and they couldn't help but applaud thunderously. They said: "Chairman Mao is so healthy, he is like a green and strong pine tree!" "This is the infinite happiness of our people in various countries." They all sincerely wished Chairman Mao a long life. In the remote African desert, in a very secluded small city—Atar in Mauritania, the citizens there also miss Chairman Mao, repeatedly reminding a visiting Chinese delegation to greet Chairman Mao on their behalf. A worker from Hungary hugged his little daughter to visit the exhibition of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Budapest. When this little girl saw the photo of Chairman Mao standing on Tiananmen, she happily shouted: "Look, Uncle Mao is here." "I really love Uncle Mao." A patriot from the front lines of Laos spoke the words of the world's people. He said: "The Lao people love Chairman Mao more than their own parents. Parents only gave us life, but Mao Zedong Thought liberated us from the oppression and slavery of imperialism and gave us new life." An old warrior who participated in the liberation war in Algeria also said: We revolutionary people love Chairman Mao the most, love to read Chairman Mao's books, because "he always lives among the people, he understands the people's hearts the most, he understands the people's sufferings the most. His eyes, his thoughts, are always with the people." A friend from Australia sincerely expressed in a letter: "The sea may dry up, the stones may crumble, but our admiration for Chairman Mao will never change for thousands of generations."

Chairman Mao's Name Is a Symbol of Power

Chairman Mao's name is a symbol of power, a symbol of struggle, a symbol of unity. Today, in various places around the world, the loudest and most affectionate battle cry is: "Long live Chairman Mao!" Shouting it, many national liberation warriors in Asia, Africa, and Latin America march to battle and celebrate victory. Shouting it, more and more revolutionary people in North America, Western Europe, and Oceania are full of vigor and join the struggle. Shouting it, many revolutionaries in Asia stand unyielding before the enemy's bayonets, fearless and unshaken, they bravely sacrifice their lives for the revolution. In the country praised as the "sky-high mountain of heroes," when the Albanian people shout it, it contains the deepest and most sincere fighting affection. In the Soviet Union shrouded in white terror, when the people with a glorious revolutionary tradition shout it, it shows the people's fearless spirit of contempt for the traitors and scoundrels of "a handful of yellow earth." There, how many people often burst with uncontrollable passion, bravely shouting "Mao Zedong—Lenin!" to Chinese comrades despite the surveillance of spies. On the stormy shore, some sailors from Northern Europe have not once gazed at the rising red sun in the east and shouted passionately: "Mao Zedong!" A three-year-old girl from Congo (Brazzaville) shouted "Mao Zedong Onana (long live)!" when she saw guests from China. A blind man from Syria insisted that his friend take him to the Mao Zedong statue in the Chinese pavilion at the Damascus International Exposition to describe the great image of Mao Chairman. He shouted while listening: "China, Mao Zedong! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Billions of hearts in the world are directed towards Chairman Mao, billions of eyes are looking at Chairman Mao. How many people consider seeing Chairman Mao as their greatest wish in life; how many people are excited and cannot sleep after shaking hands with Chairman Mao, and "simply do not want to wash their hands again," saying this is the greatest honor of their life. How many revolutionaries in Western Europe and North America have expressed their revolutionary determination in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. How many Greek, Spanish, and Yugoslav revolutionary exiles have shed tears of joy after seeing the radiant portrait of Chairman Mao, strengthening their confidence in the struggle against the enemy. How many people in the world yearn to obtain the precious gift—Chairman Mao's portrait or Chairman Mao's badge, because "with it, you can be with Chairman Mao," "standing in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, you are full of strength." An old worker in the Soviet Union, after obtaining a Chairman Mao badge, proudly patted his chest and said: "I wear Chairman Mao's badge on the highest place on my chest, so that everyone can see it!" A driver from Yemen hung a portrait of Chairman Mao neatly in his home. He said: "Let my friends and my family see Chairman Mao every day." A young warrior from Laos, carrying a portrait of Chairman Mao with the words "Chairman Mao, we love you" on the back, rushed to the battlefield to fight bravely against the enemy. Many young people in Africa and Japan carried portraits of Chairman Mao and held massive anti-American demonstrations. A friend from Southwest Africa said, "You can't praise enough our admiration for Chairman Mao." The Arab people said well: "Seek truth, go to China!" Because China is Chairman Mao's hometown.

Revolutionaries around the world all praise Beijing, where Chairman Mao lives and works, as the "world revolutionary Yan'an," the socialist China led by Chairman Mao as the "world revolutionary base—Jinggangshan," and the Chinese Communist Party created and nurtured by Chairman Mao as the "locomotive of the world revolution." Every year, tens of thousands of friends from the five continents come to China to visit. In the southwest corner of Africa, there are four young girls who, out of deep respect and love for the great Mao Zedong, with burning hearts, rushed to the distant New China. During their journey in Africa, they spent several months, traveled thousands of miles, braved the desert, crossed the forest, faced the threat of lions, escaped police pursuits, sat in prison, got lost, endured hardships, and overcame countless difficulties. But they did not waver, did not surrender, because the great name of Mao Zedong inspired them, encouraged them, and gave them endless strength. They finally arrived in China, arrived by Chairman Mao's side. How eagerly foreign friends visiting China yearn for the places where Chairman Mao has lived and fought, how reverently they visit the revolutionary holy lands where Chairman Mao has created heroic deeds. Many people picked up stones from Jinggangshan and treasured them like jewels, saying they would take this "spark" back home. Many people broke off green branches from the date trees in front of the cave dwellings in Yan'an where Chairman Mao lived, keeping them as "eternal mementos." A comrade from Vietnam, while visiting the birthplace of the red sun—Mao Zedong's former residence in Shaoshan, was lost in thought and wrote the following poem with deep emotion: "The sun rises from Shaoshan, the sun rises in the east, today the red is everywhere, the east wind rises on all sides."

Sailing to Victory Along the Course Opened by Chairman Mao

"The East Is Red, the sun rises, China has given birth to Mao Zedong..." This magnificent and powerful song, soaring into the clouds, has crossed mountains and rivers, spreading to every corner of the world. It is like the bell of the times, shattering the evil dreams of the old world and calling for the birth of a new era; it is like the battle horn, urging revolutionaries to advance bravely. Singing "The East Is Red," the people of the world are heroic and united; singing "The East Is Red," the people of the world have a common direction. The people of the world sing in unison and sing passionately: Mao Zedong is the "hero of our times," the "peak of wisdom in this century." His "great name is closely linked with the history of the world." He uses his "iron arms," "changing the whole world," he "waves an iron broom, sweeping away all the remnants and dregs." He is the "wise and clever helmsman, always guiding people to their destination in the midst of storms." The billion people of the world firmly declare that they will definitely sail the "fearless battleship" of the world revolution to the shores of victory along the broad course opened by Chairman Mao. A member of the "Mao Zedong Works Study Group" in Mexico said well in a poem dedicated to Chairman Mao:

Ah! Chairman Mao Zedong,
The revolutionary people follow you,
Because you are the helmsman of the sea voyage,
You are the savior of the people,
You are the glory of our times,
You are the eternal victory!
In front of the red sun of the East,
The old world trembles and shudders.
Ah! Mao Zedong, we follow you!
Following you, we will be victorious.
Long live victorious China!
Long live the contemporary Lenin!

    全世界革命人民欢呼伟大的毛泽东时代
    从东方升起的红太阳，发出万道金光，普照着沸腾的大地。这红太阳就是伟大的毛泽东，这灿烂夺目的金光就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。世界上一切真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民都一致称颂：伟大的毛主席是当代最杰出的无产阶级革命家，是最伟大的天才；伟大的毛泽东思想是当代的共产主义思想体系，是放之四海而皆准的革命真理。在当今的世界上，毛主席的威望最高，毛泽东思想的威力最大。在这个帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代里，毛泽东这一光辉的名字，就是时代的标志。全世界的革命人民在欢呼：我们的时代，就是毛泽东时代，就是大立毛泽东思想的时代，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗胜利进军的世界大革命时代。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，震撼了全球，进一步唤起世界革命人民，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，扫除一切害人虫，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。全世界五大洲四大洋，高唱着《大海航行靠舵手》的赞歌，飘扬着毛泽东思想的战旗，翻滚着波澜壮阔的革命洪流。
    毛主席——亿万人心中的红太阳
    站在反美斗争最前线的越南的一位同志，最近写了一首热情奔放的颂诗，表达了他和全世界人民对伟大的毛主席的最真挚的热爱。他在诗中歌唱：
    毛主席，
    是亿万人心中的红太阳，
    是革命的舵手，
    是世界无产者的敬爱领袖，
    是当代最伟大的马克思主义者，
    是天才的战略家。
    他百战百胜，
    同革命形影不离。
    他的思想，比枪林剑海还要强。
    他锻炼出百万雄兵，
    正战斗在五大洲四大洋。
    全世界被压迫人民要造反，全世界被压迫民族要解放，全世界无产者要砸碎旧世界，敢教日月换新天。全世界越来越多的革命者正集合在毛泽东的旗帜下，集合在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，大闹世界革命，要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。他们异口同声地说：毛泽东，只有毛泽东，是世界革命人民无可争辩的、当之无愧的伟大导师。
    今天，在全世界每一个地方——从战火冲天的亚洲到烽火四起的非洲，从星火燎原的拉丁美洲到怒火欲燃的北美、西欧和大洋洲，千千万万的人民都以无限热爱、无比向往的心情，仰望着中国，仰望着北京，仰望着英明的舵手毛泽东。他们用最强烈的革命感情祝福毛主席，用最生动的语言歌颂毛主席。他们说：毛主席，是“茫茫革命海洋的灯塔”，是“人类希望的火炬”，是“胜利的旗帜”，是“新时代的曙光”；他们说：毛主席，是“世界红色思想的英勇捍卫者”，是“世界革命人民的带路人”，是“世界上最伟大和最令人敬佩的人物”；他们说：毛主席，是“世界人民最忠诚和最自觉的勤务员”，是“各国被压迫人民的伟大朋友和伟大的保卫者”，是“有史以来造福于人类的最伟大的思想家”。
    世界人民对毛主席表示了无限的信任，无比的崇敬。在整个人类历史上，没有任何一个人像毛主席这样，不仅在七亿中国人民中间享有如此绝对、如此崇高的威信，而且博得全世界亿万人民的如此高度、如此深厚的信赖。全世界人民感谢毛主席给他们展示了新的真理，开辟了新的道路；感谢毛主席打开了历史的新的一章，为世界革命创建了无可比拟的丰功伟绩。
    跟着毛泽东，世界一片红
    全世界革命者坚信：跟着毛泽东，世界一片红。这因为：
    正是毛主席，他“有着钢铁般坚强的革命意志，有着水晶般晶莹清澈的阶级感情，有着灯塔般光芒四射的英明思想”。
    正是毛主席，他“接过了马克思、列宁手中的革命火炬，照亮了全世界革命人民和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族解放革命的前进道路”。
    正是毛主席，他“经历过这样长期而复杂的斗争，领导中国人民战胜了多少国内外敌人，同人民群众有着多么密切的联系”。
    正是毛主席，他“在修正主义泛滥的时候，创造性地捍卫了马克思列宁主义学说”，“把马克思列宁主义提高到了一个更高的发展阶段”。
    正是毛主席，他“不仅在理论上说明了世界上最广大的人民群众造反有理，而更重要的是指导了他们的斗争，为他们提供了策略武器，在物质上支持了他们，在精神上鼓舞了他们”。
    正是毛主席，他胸怀世界，高瞻远瞩，“日夜构思着人类未来最美好的图景”，“为世界革命者指出了光辉灿烂的前途”。
    全世界的无产者和革命人民都自豪地说：“毛泽东是属于你们的，也是属于我们的，他是属于全世界革命人民的！”北加里曼丹的一位民族解放战士庄重指出，“没有毛泽东，就没有新世界。”锡兰的朋友高呼：
  “被压迫人民需要毛泽东！”阿尔及利亚的朋友高呼：“全世界人民需要毛泽东！”缅甸的和平人士坚定地说，有了毛泽东，就“信心百倍，无所畏惧”。刚果（布）的劳动者和老挝的青年战士，印度的作家和津巴布韦的记者，日本的知名人士和拉丁美洲的社会活动家，以及其他许许多多革命者，从他们战斗的每一个地方激奋地欢呼：“在我们的时代，有毛泽东这样最杰出的领袖，是全世界人民的最大幸福！”“我们为生活在毛泽东时代而感到光荣，而感到骄傲”。
    毛主席同世界人民心连心
    毛主席同世界人民心连心。他永远和世界人民同命运，共呼吸。各国人民说，毛泽东，“世界革命的伟大导师”，“各国人民心中永远不落的红太阳”，他“最关心世界人民的疾苦”，“最了解世界人民的愿望”，“最相信世界人民的力量”，“最支持世界人民的斗争”。在世界各地，多少受苦受难的人们，多少为解放而献身的人们，多少为建设新社会而奋斗的人们，都在日日夜夜地怀念着毛主席。在一九六六年夏天，毛主席畅游长江的喜讯传出后，各国革命人民心花怒放，为毛主席长寿健康而热烈欢呼。毛主席接见由红卫兵小将和全国革命师生等组成的文化革命大军的几部纪录影片陆续在各国上映时，吸引了世界上广大观众，许多外国朋友从银幕上看到毛主席满面红光，神采奕奕，都情不自禁地响起雷鸣般的掌声。他们说：“毛主席身体多么健康，他像青翠的劲松一样！”“这是我们各国人民的无限幸福。”他们都衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆。在遥远的非洲大沙漠里的一座非常偏僻的小城——毛里塔尼亚的阿塔尔市，那里的市民对毛主席也是那么怀念，一再叮咛一个来访的中国代表团，一定要代他们向毛主席问好。匈牙利一位工人抱着他的小女儿去参观在布达佩斯举行的中国无产阶级文化大革命图片展览会。当这个小姑娘见到毛主席站在天安门上的照片时，高兴地嚷起来：“喏，毛伯伯在这儿。”“我真爱毛伯伯。”来自老挝前线的一位爱国战士说出了世界人民的心里话。他说：“我们老挝人民热爱毛主席胜过爱自己的亲生父母。亲生父母只生了我们的身，毛泽东思想使我们从帝国主义压迫和奴役下解放出来，获得新生。”阿尔及利亚有位参加过解放战争的老战士也说：我们革命人民最爱毛主席，最爱读毛主席的书，因为“他永远生活在人民群众之中，他最懂得群众的心，最了解群众的疾苦。他的眼睛，他的思想，是永远向着群众的。”澳大利亚一位朋友在一封信中诚挚地表示：“海可枯，石可烂，但是我们对毛主席的爱戴千秋万载永不变。”
    毛主席的名字就是力量的象征
    毛主席的名字就象征着力量，象征着战斗，象征着团结。今天，在世界各地，人们喊得最响亮，最亲切的战斗口号就是：“毛主席万岁！”喊着它，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的许多民族解放战士们走向战斗，庆祝胜利。喊着它，北美、西欧和大洋洲越来越多的革命人民意气风发，投入斗争。喊着它，亚洲的许多革命者在敌人刺刀前，面不改色心不跳，他们慷慨就义，为革命献出生命。在被誉为“耸入云霄的高山”的英雄之国，当阿尔巴尼亚人民喊着它，它蕴藏着最深厚最真诚的战斗情谊。在笼罩着白色恐怖的苏联，当有着光荣革命传统的人民喊着它，它显示出了人们对叛徒们和工贼们这“一抔黄土”万分鄙视的大无畏精神。在那里，有多少人常常怀着抑制不住的激情，不顾特务的监视而勇敢地对中国同志喊一声：“毛泽东—列宁！”在惊涛拍岸的海滨，北欧的一些海员不止一次地眺望东方初升的一轮红日而纵情喊着：“毛泽东！”刚果（布）一个三岁的女孩子当看到从中国来的客人时，就亲热地喊起“毛泽东奥那（万岁）！”叙利亚的一位盲人，一定要他的朋友把他领到大马士革国际博览会中国馆内的毛主席像前，给他描述毛主席的伟大形象。他边听边欢呼：“中国，毛泽东！万岁，毛主席！”
    全世界亿万颗心向着毛主席，亿万双眼睛望着毛主席。多少人以能见到毛主席为生平第一愿望；多少人因同毛主席握过手而兴奋得不能入眠，而“简直从此不愿再洗手”，说这是一生最大的光荣。西欧和北美多少忧国忧民的革命志士，在毛主席的像前表示了革命的决心。希腊的、西班牙的和南斯拉夫的多少革命流亡者曾因见到容光焕发的毛主席像而热泪盈眶，增强了对敌斗争的信心。全世界有多少人啊，在殷切地盼望得到珍贵的礼物——毛主席画像或毛主席像章，因为“有了它就可以同毛主席在一起”，“站在毛主席像前，就浑身都是力量”。苏联有位老工人得到一枚毛主席像章，拍着胸脯自豪地说：“我把毛主席的像章挂在胸前最高处，让人们都能看到！”也门有位司机，把一幅毛主席像端端正正地挂在家里。他说：“让我的朋友和我的家里人都能天天看看毛主席。”老挝一位青年战士，带着背面写有“毛主席，我们爱您”字句的毛主席像，奔赴战场，去同敌人英勇搏斗。非洲和日本的许多青年抬着毛主席的画像，举行声势浩大的反美游行示威。西南非洲一位朋友说，“写上一厚本书，也说不尽我们对毛主席的景仰。”阿拉伯人民说得好：“寻真理，去中国！”因为中国是毛主席的故乡。
    全世界革命者都称颂毛主席居住和工作的地方北京是“世界革命的延安”，毛主席所领导建立的社会主义中国是“世界革命根据地——井冈山”，毛主席亲手缔造和哺育的中国共产党是“世界革命的火车头”。每年都有成千上万的五大洲的朋友来到中国访问。非洲西南角有四位年轻的姑娘，就是由于对伟大的毛泽东无比崇敬、无比热爱，怀着火热的心，奔向遥远的新中国。在非洲那一段旅程中，她们历时几个月，跋涉几千里，披星戴月，餐风宿露，越过干旱的大沙漠，穿过原始的大森林。她们在途中不怕狮子的威胁，不顾警察的追捕，坐过监狱，迷过方向，饱尝艰辛，历经万难。但是，她们没有动摇，没有屈服，因为毛泽东这个伟大的名字感召着她们，鼓舞着她们，给了她们以无穷的力量。她们终于来到了中国，来到了毛主席的身边。来中国访问的外国朋友多么热切地向往着毛主席生活过和战斗过的地方，多么崇敬地瞻仰着毛主席曾经创建过英雄业绩的革命圣地。许多人从井冈山上拾起石块，像珍宝一样包藏起来，说要把这“星星之火”带回去。许多人在毛主席住过的延安窑洞前的枣树上折下青枝，留作“永恒的纪念”。越南一位同志在参观红太阳的升起地——毛主席旧居韶山时，浮想联翩，盛情挥笔，写就了这样的诗篇：“日自韶山出，日出东方红，当今红四面，四面起东风。”
    沿着毛主席开拓的航道驶向胜利
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……。”这支雄浑壮丽的颂歌，高唱入云，它越过了万水千山，传遍了世界各地。它像时代的洪钟，惊碎了旧世界的恶梦，召唤了新纪元的诞生；它像战斗的号角，频催着革命者奋勇前进。唱起《东方红》，世界人民心雄志壮；唱起《东方红》，世界人民团结一心；唱起《东方红》，世界人民有了共同的方向。世界人民同声传诵，纵情歌唱：毛泽东是“我们时代的英雄”，是“本世纪智慧的顶峰”。他的“伟大的名字同世界的历史紧密相联”。他用“钢臂铁手”，“使整个世界变样”，他“挥起铁扫帚，把残渣余孽一扫而光”。他“是英明机智的舵手，在惊涛骇浪中总是能把人们导向目的地”。全世界亿万人民坚定地表示，他们一定会沿着毛主席开拓的宽阔的航道，把世界革命的“无畏战舰”驶向胜利的彼岸。墨西哥“毛泽东著作学习小组”成员在献给毛主席的一首诗中说得好：
    啊！毛泽东主席，
    革命人民都跟着您，
    因为您是大海航行的舵手，
    您是人民的救星，
    您是我们时代的光荣，
    您是永恒的胜利！
    在东方的红太阳面前，
    旧世界在发抖战栗。
    啊！毛泽东，我们跟着您呵！
    跟着您，我们就胜利。
    万岁！胜利的中国！
    万岁！当代的列宁！新华社记者
