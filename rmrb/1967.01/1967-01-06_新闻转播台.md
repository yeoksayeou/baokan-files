Every evening, when the Central People's Broadcasting Station begins to broadcast the song "The East Is Red," the old poor peasant Ma Zhenjiang from Xingtai County, Hebei, always leans over his beloved "Self-Reliance" brand transistor radio, quietly listening to the voice from Chairman Mao's side, attentively listening to the broadcaster recite Chairman Mao's quotations, and the broadcast revolutionary songs. The more he listens, the happier he becomes, and his face breaks into a smile.

When it comes to Old Man Ma listening to the radio, there is an interesting story behind it!

Last spring, Ma Zhenjiang's eldest son, who works in Beijing, sent him a small transistor radio. The radio had no brand name, but from the letter, Ma Zhenjiang knew it was assembled by his son himself. Therefore, he gave it a name, calling it the "Self-Reliance" brand.

Old Man Ma treats this "Self-Reliance" brand small radio as his "palm-sized treasure." He uses his calloused hands to caress the beautiful plastic casing and says to his family, "Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have we poor people truly been able to hold our heads high. In the past, these hands that held a dog-beating stick now have to twist the radio knobs!" This made the whole family laugh with joy.

Old Man Ma weighed it in his hands and placed the radio on the table under Chairman Mao's portrait in the main hall. From then on, he would look at Chairman Mao's portrait and this small radio countless times a day. He would turn on the radio to listen whenever he had a moment, whether it was early in the morning, late at night, before work, or after work.

After the earthquake in this area, the army propagated Mao Zedong Thought here. Old Man Ma held the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and studied them hungrily. The more he studied, the more he felt his mind was filled with thoughts. Take listening to the radio, for example. Initially, he felt content just to listen to the radio in his spare time. However, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he compared it with Mao Zedong's teachings: "Our army is completely for the people, and it works thoroughly for the people's interests." His thoughts began to clash, and in the end, the "self" was defeated, and the "public" won. From this, Old Man Ma realized: in the past, he only saw the tip of his own nose and did not think of the people; he only listened to the radio for the plays he wanted to hear and did not think of domestic and international affairs. He thought, "Our production brigade has suffered serious damage from the earthquake, and the brigade's radio has also been destroyed. Only my small radio is intact. Chairman Mao wants us to serve the people 'completely' and 'thoroughly.' I should let this 'Self-Reliance' radio play a greater role in propaganda."

The nights in the countryside are particularly quiet. The voice of the "Self-Reliance" brand radio sounded especially loud and clear. After Old Man Ma's thoughts clashed and the "self" was defeated, that very evening, he invited all the neighbors to come and listen to the radio. The community members recited Chairman Mao's quotations together with the radio's voice and sang "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on the Sea" together.

After listening to the radio, Old Man Ma, smoking his pipe, humorously said to everyone, "Tonight is the first day, let's call it the opening. In the future, everyone should come to 'patronize' more often." From then on, Old Man Ma's courtyard was always full of listeners during their spare time, truly "no empty seats."

After some time, Old Man Ma's thoughts clashed again. He thought, "'Completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people has no end! I can invite everyone to come in and study Mao Zedong Thought, but why can't I take Mao Zedong Thought to the streets and fields?" Therefore, he made up his mind to adopt the method of learning for the illiterate, memorizing Chairman Mao's quotations from the radio. He said, "Although I am illiterate, my two ears are sharp, and I can hear in all directions, especially loving to hear Chairman Mao's words." Old Man Ma decided to take Old Man Qu as an example, overcome all difficulties, and learn the "Three Constantly Read Articles" well. He would spread Mao Zedong Thought to every corner and occupy all positions.

The hearts of old poor peasants are the most sincere; they are the most loyal to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever is on their minds, they will act on it immediately. Old Man Ma immediately began his work as a "volunteer propagandist." In the drought-stricken fields where "rain is more precious than oil, and sweat is cheaper than water," he carried two buckets on his shoulders and propagated to everyone, "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." He encouraged the community members to fight against the drought and achieve a good harvest in summer and autumn. He found that when people encountered various difficulties after the earthquake, he recited to everyone, "Our cadres must care for every soldier, and all revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." This made people develop a communist spirit and, with the spirit of self-reliance, solve many difficulties in developing production and rebuilding their homes. In this way, in a short time, the community members gave him a new name—"Old Red Propaganda Worker."

With this name, Old Man Ma's thoughts were stirred again. That night, he lay on the kang, and for a long time, his upper eyelid would not meet his lower eyelid. His thoughts clashed again. Chairman Mao said, "You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" The soldiers also said, "Three-sevenths of the world's people are still suffering and need our support and rescue." Old Man Ma recalled these words and said to himself, "Old Ying, you are a member of a people's commune in China and should contribute your share to the world revolution!" The great revolutionary ideal inspired this old man, so he not only led in everything, worked hard, and achieved full attendance to produce more grain to support the Chinese revolution and the world revolution but also every day propagated the domestic and international news he heard on the radio in the streets, dining halls, and fields to the community members, inspiring everyone's revolutionary spirit. The community members said, "Old Man Ma's home has become a real 'News Relay Station.'"

"That's good, let's call this news relay station of our North Hakou Brigade in the commune!" Old Man Ma laughed heartily and patted his chest, saying, "As long as we can contribute to the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought, this is the greatest happiness and greatest joy for us poor and lower-middle peasants!"

    “新闻转播台”
    马兴华
    “东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”每天晚上，当中央人民广播电台开始播送《东方红》歌曲时，河北邢台县老贫农马振江总要俯在他心爱的“自力更生”牌半导体收音机前，静静地收听来自毛主席身边的声音，全神贯注地听着播音员诵读毛主席语录，和演播的革命歌曲……。他越听越乐，脸上绽开了笑纹。
    提起马大爷收听广播这桩事来，还有一段有趣的故事哩！
    去年春上，马大爷在北京工作的大儿子给他捎回一台小半导体收音机。收音机没有牌号，马大爷从信上得知这是儿子亲手装配的，所以，他便给它起了个名字，叫做“自力更生”牌。
    马大爷把这台“自力更生”牌小收音机看做
  “掌上明珠”。他用一双布满厚茧的手抚摸着那漂亮的塑料外壳，对全家人说：“只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下，咱们穷人才真正扬眉吐气了。过去咱这双拿打狗棍的手，如今也要拧拧收音机啦！”这一说，乐得全家人都合不拢嘴。
    马大爷左掂对、右合计，把收音机放置在正堂屋迎门的毛主席像下的桌子上。打这以后，他一天不知要看多少次毛主席像和这台小收音机。他趁着一早、一晚，上工前，下工后，一有空儿就要打开收音机听听。
    这个地区地震以后，解放军在这里宣传毛泽东思想。马大爷手捧“老三篇”如饥似渴地学呀学呀！他越学越觉得心里装的事儿越多。就拿收听广播来说吧，起初他觉得自己利用工余时间听听广播，就心满意足了。可是，学习了《为人民服务》以后，他根据毛主席的教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”两相一对照，思想上就打起“架”来了，打来打去，把“私”字斗输了，“公”字胜利了。从这里马大爷觉察到：过去自己只是看到自己的鼻子尖，没有想到人民；听广播只是收听自己想听的戏，没有想到国内外大事。他想：“我们大队遭到了严重地震的破坏，大队的收音机也被砸坏，只有我这一台小收音机还是囫囵的。毛主席要我们‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务，我应该让这台‘自力更生’起到更大的宣传作用。”
    农村的夜晚，格外宁静。那台“自力更生”牌收音机的声音显得特别宏亮、清脆。在马大爷思想里进行一番破私立公斗争之后，当天晚上，他就把四邻八舍的乡亲们都招呼来收听广播。社员们同收音机的声音一起诵读毛主席语录，一起高唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》。
    听完广播，马大爷抽着旱烟，风趣地对大伙说：“今晚是头一天，算做开张，往后，乡亲们要多来‘照顾照顾’门面。”此后，马大爷的四合院子里，每逢工余时间，前来的听众总是满满当当，可算
  “座无虚席”。
    过了一段时间，马大爷的思想又进一步打起“架”来。他想：“‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务可没个边儿呀！我能把大伙儿请进来学习毛泽东思想，那为什么不能把毛泽东思想再送到街头、田间呢？”于是，他下定决心，采取了不识字的学习方法，从收音机里熟背毛主席语录。他说：“俺虽是不识字的人，可两个耳朵挺灵，能听四面八方，最爱听毛主席的话。”马大爷决心以老愚公为榜样，排除万难，学好“老三篇”。把毛泽东思想传到各个角落，去占领一切阵地。
    老贫农的心是最赤诚的，他们最忠于党，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想。什么事情只要在他们的思想上“挂了号”，就会立竿见影。马大爷立即开始作“义务宣传员”的工作了。在“雨比油贵，汗比水贱”的抗旱田头，他肩挑双桶向大伙宣传“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”鼓励社员去战胜旱魔，夺得夏、秋好收成。他发现人们在地震后碰到各种困难的时候，就给大伙念“我们的干部要关心每一个战士，一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”使人们发扬了共产主义风格，在发展生产，重建家园中，本着自力更生的精神，解决了很多困难。……这样，时间不久，社员们便给他送了一个新名字——“老红色宣传员”。
    这么一叫，又触动了马大爷的思想。晚上，他躺在炕上，好大工夫上眼皮老是不挨下眼皮，思想上又打起“架”来。毛主席说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”解放军同志也说过：“世界上还有三分之二的人民正在受苦受难，需要我们去支援他们，去解救他们。”马大爷回忆着这些话，自己对自己说：“老迎呀老迎（马大爷的小名）！你是一个中国人民公社的社员，应当为世界革命做出自己的一份贡献呀！”远大的革命理想鼓舞着这位老人，所以，他不仅自己时时、事事带头干，争出工、出全勤，为多打粮食支援中国革命和世界革命尽力，而且每天把收听到的国内外大事在街头、在饭场、在田间向社员们宣传，去鼓舞人们的革命斗志。社员们说：“马大爷家成了一个名副其实的‘新闻转播台’了。”
    “那好，就叫咱们这个公社北哈口大队的新闻转播台吧！”马大爷哈哈笑着拍拍胸膛说，“只要能为宣传毛泽东思想出点力，这就是咱们贫下中农最大的快乐！最大的幸福！”（附图片）
