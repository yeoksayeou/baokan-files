The people of Arab countries hold great respect and affection for Chairman Mao.

In Syria, a young printer said: "Chairman Mao is the leader of all the Chinese people and the oppressed peoples of the world. Chairman Mao's people's war thought has world-wide guiding significance. He has created many brilliant theories. The great people's war thought, which has been proven by the Chinese revolution and the ongoing Vietnam War, is one of them. Chairman Mao's people's war thought is based on completely relying on the masses."

After watching the film of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards and the news of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards eight times, this worker said, Chairman Mao loves the masses very much, and the masses love Chairman Mao infinitely. He praised, "Chairman Mao is approachable and always gets along with the masses. A great revolutionary leader like Chairman Mao is unprecedented in history."

An elderly Syrian driver enthusiastically told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader in the world. He is the savior of all oppressed nations, small nations, and all the poor. Without Mao Zedong and the people of China under his leadership, the world would fall into endless darkness."

He said, "I often point to the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall and tell my children, 'This is the greatest savior of mankind, Chairman Mao.'"

He said, "China is not like those countries that say one thing and do another. China truly supports the struggles of the peoples of all countries."

He also said, "Imperialism and revisionism are most afraid of China and Mao Zedong Thought, while the peoples of the world most support and love China and Mao Zedong Thought."

In Iraq, a friend praised Chairman Mao as "the sun in the hearts of all the people of the world." An Iraqi youth military officer emphasized, "Mao Zedong Thought is very great. The 700 million Chinese people united as one under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought are a reliable guarantee for the victory of all the peoples of the world and the defeat of American imperialism."

A leader of the Palestinian Students Union in Iraq praised, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the peoples of the world."

An Arab student said, "Great Mao Zedong not only leads China forward but also leads the revolutionary struggle of all the peoples of the world. I will definitely study Mao Zedong Thought very seriously."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, January 9, many Syrian friends sent New Year's greetings and letters to Xinhua News Agency on the occasion of the New Year, paying tribute to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically praising the great Mao Zedong Thought.

A friend named Muhammad enthusiastically said, "The peoples of the world love the great Chairman Mao very much because he is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of the peoples of the world. I wish him a happy New Year." He also enthusiastically congratulated the development and growth of the Chinese Red Guards and congratulated China's new nuclear test success.

A youth in a greeting letter wished Chairman Mao good health. He said, "I salute the friendly Chinese people for their struggle against imperialism and reactionaries of all countries. I am especially proud of China's aid to the heroic Vietnamese people."

A friend named Khalid wrote in his New Year's greeting, "Salute to the great commander, beloved Chairman Mao, and express my most sincere and warmest wishes to him."

According to Xinhua News Agency, a Syrian friend who recently visited China wrote a letter after returning home, enthusiastically praising the great Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "After visiting China, I further understood that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest stage of Marxism-Leninism, the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism, and the guide to action for all revolutionaries."

He said, "Mao Zedong is the teacher and commander who leads all the oppressed peoples of the world to victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and sharpest spiritual weapon, the weapon to overthrow imperialism and colonialism, and the cornerstone of building a new world. The peoples of the world will build a new world on this solid, immortal, and eternal foundation."
