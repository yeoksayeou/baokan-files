According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou on the 20th, the *Zhejiang Daily* reported: The revolutionary rebel workers of the Hangzhou Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory have been studying Chairman Mao's works actively and practically, and have timely exposed the new conspiracies of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, who are playing economic tricks in the new situation. They insist on seizing the revolution and promoting production, achieving double victories in both revolution and production.

A few days ago, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line in this factory attempted to use material incentives to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses. Some who were temporarily unaware of the truth thought that these people had "improved" when they heard that the factory party committee had approved a subsidy of 200 yuan for each apprentice for travel and two months' allowance. Have they really improved? No, they have become more treacherous! The service team of the Red Apprentice Revolutionary Rebel Brigade in this factory, together with their comrades, studied Chairman Mao's quotations on class and class struggle in light of their experiences from the previous stage of struggle, with the question of whether these people had improved. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will still struggle to the last. Even after the country is pacified, they will continue to engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, attempting to restore their rule in China every day and every hour." The soldiers said, Chairman Mao's words are absolutely true. In our factory, that handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, in the early stages of the movement, provided various conveniences to the "Red Alliance" and those right-wing conservative organizations, giving them whatever they wanted, encouraging them to create public opinion to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, they suppressed and obstructed in every way the reasonable demands of the revolutionary rebels. As the situation developed, the strength of the revolutionary rebels grew stronger and stronger. Seeing that their tactics were no longer effective, they immediately made a 180-degree turn, putting on a "supportive" face, attempting to push us out of the factory and weaken the fighting strength of our revolutionary rebels. After arming their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, the soldiers of this brigade timely exposed the evil conspiracies of these bastards who adopted new methods to sabotage the Cultural Revolution in the new situation. They decided to strictly follow the *Urgent Notice* issued by the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 32 other revolutionary rebel organizations, and temporarily not go out for linking up. They also issued an urgent appeal to all revolutionary rebel organizations and the broad revolutionary masses in the province, calling on workers, cadres, enterprise and institution staff, and apprentices who have gone out for linking up to immediately return to their original units and become the vanguard and backbone of "seizing the revolution and promoting production."

At present, all the soldiers of the Red Apprentice Revolutionary Rebel Brigade of the Hangzhou Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory are full of fighting spirit. While actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they are also firmly guarding their production posts. Many apprentices, in order to complete the state's production plan and to make up for the losses caused by some workers who left their production posts without reason to join the "Red Alliance," are working shifts with revolutionary rebel veteran workers and actively completing the state's production tasks.

　　以毛主席著作为武器
　　识破阶级敌人新阴谋
　　杭州棉纺织印染厂革命造反派工人，坚决反对经济主义，坚持抓革命，促生产
    据新华社杭州二十日电　据《浙江日报》报道：杭州棉纺织印染厂的革命造反派工人，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，及时识破党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，在新形势下玩弄的经济主义的新阴谋，坚持抓革命，促生产，做到革命、生产双胜利。
    前几天，这个厂的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，妄图用物质刺激，来腐蚀群众的革命意志。有些一时不明真相的人，听说厂党委已经批准每一个徒工发两百元串连费、两个月津贴费时，还以为这些人“好”起来了。真的好起来了吗？不，更毒啦！这个厂的赤色徒工革命造反兵团勤务组带着这个问题和战友们一起，联系前一阶段斗争的经历，学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的语录。毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”战士们说，毛主席的话说得千真万确。我们厂里那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，他们在运动初期，对“红联军”和那些右倾保守组织，给予种种方便，要物有物，要钱有钱，鼓励他们去制造破坏无产阶级文化大革命的舆论。而对革命造反派的一些合理要求，却百般刁难，百般压制。随着形势的发展，革命造反派的力量越来越壮大了，他们眼看这套手法不顶用，马上来了一个一百八十度的大转弯，扮出一副“支持”的面孔，妄图把我们推出厂门，削弱我们革命造反派的战斗力。这个兵团的战士用毛泽东思想武装头脑以后，及时识破了这些混蛋们在新形势下采取新的方式破坏文化大革命的罪恶阴谋，决定坚决遵照上海工人革命造反总司令部等三十二个革命造反组织发出的《紧急通告》办事，暂不外出串连。他们并向全省革命造反派组织和广大革命群众发出紧急呼吁，要求已外出串连的工人、干部、企业事业工作人员、艺徒等立即返回原单位，做“抓革命，促生产”的先锋和骨干。
    目前，杭州棉纺织印染厂赤色徒工革命造反兵团的全体战士，个个斗志昂扬，一面积极参加文化大革命；一面坚守生产岗位。有许多徒工为了完成国家生产计划，为了弥补部分参加“红联军”的工人无故离开生产岗位所造成的损失，正在和革命造反派老工人一起顶班劳动，积极完成国家生产任务。
