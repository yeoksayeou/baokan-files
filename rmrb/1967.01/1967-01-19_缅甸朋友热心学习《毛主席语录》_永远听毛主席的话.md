Many Burmese friends have an infinite love and admiration for Chairman Mao. They enthusiastically study Chairman Mao's works. They say that Mao Zedong Thought is the torch of revolution, the beacon of revolution. They promise Chinese friends that they will always listen to Chairman Mao's words.

Once, four Burmese workers received Chairman Mao's badges and "Chairman Mao's Quotations" from Chinese friends. They wrote a letter expressing their heartfelt thanks. The letter said: "We have received a priceless treasure, and we are infinitely happy. We promise our friends: We will always listen to Chairman Mao's words." The letter also said: "If there were no People's Republic of China holding high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in Asia, Asia would suffer from the unbridled slavery of imperialism. This is why the Asian people love Chairman Mao as they love their own lives."

Not long ago, a Burmese youth student obtained an English version of "Chairman Mao's Quotations." He and some of his classmates immediately read it eagerly and had a collective discussion. Later, they collectively translated "Chairman Mao's Quotations" into Burmese. They said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the torch of revolution, the beacon of revolution. It points the way forward for the youth."

    缅甸朋友热心学习《毛主席语录》 
    永远听毛主席的话
    据新华社仰光电　缅甸许多朋友无限热爱和敬仰毛主席。他们热情地学习毛主席著作。他们说，毛泽东思想是革命的火炬，是革命的指路明灯。他们向中国朋友们保证将永远听毛主席的话。
    有一次，四名缅甸工人从中国朋友那里得到毛主席像章和《毛主席语录》后，写信表示热烈感谢。信中说：“我们收到了无价之宝，我们无限的高兴。我们向我们的朋友保证：我们将永远听毛主席的话”。信中还说：“在亚洲，要是没有中华人民共和国高举毛泽东思想的红旗，亚洲就会遭受帝国主义肆无忌惮的奴役。这就是为什么亚洲人民像热爱自己的生命那样热爱毛主席。”
    不久以前，一位缅甸青年学生得到了一本英文版的《毛主席语录》，他和他的一些同学立即如饥似渴地读起来，并且进行了集体讨论。后来，他们还集体把《毛主席语录》译成缅甸文。他们说：“毛泽东思想是革命的火炬，是革命的指路明灯，它为青年指出了前进的方向”。
