Recently, the MuLing Forestry Bureau Repair Shop's kiln group received a large batch of urgent tasks. There were only five people in the group, with a shortage of manpower, heavy tasks, and tight deadlines, making it very difficult. One day after lunch, the five members of the kiln group gathered to discuss production issues. They talked and talked, always feeling that there weren't enough people, fearing they might not be able to complete the task. Someone suggested adding more people, while others disagreed with the addition. Just as they were arguing, the lathe group came with drums and gongs, bringing Chairman Mao's quotations. The kiln group members saw that on a large red paper was written a passage from Chairman Mao: "The Yangtze River, everyone says it is very big, but actually, big is not frightening. The U.S. imperialists are big, aren't they? We have stood up to them, and it's nothing. So, some big things in the world are actually not frightening."

After reading this quotation, the members felt a surge of warmth throughout their bodies, gaining the courage and strength to overcome difficulties. Everyone excitedly said, "Thank you for your support, comrades."

The kiln group neatly pasted the quotation from the lathe group on the wall and studied it repeatedly. Zhang Shouf said, "If we are not afraid of U.S. imperialism, what are we afraid of? With Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome." Everyone unanimously agreed: "We don't need to add more people; with just the five of us, we will complete the task ahead of schedule." Previously, five people could only operate two kilns, but now five people operated three kilns. Everyone displayed a brave fighting spirit, fearless of fatigue, and fought continuously, ultimately completing the production task excellently. Group leader Zhao Wenrui said, "Thousands of supports, tens of thousands of supports, sending us Chairman Mao's quotations is the greatest support."

    最大的支援
    王长福
    前一个时期，我们穆棱林业局检修厂烘炉组接到一大批急活，组内只有五个人，人手少，任务重，时间紧，困难很大。有一天吃完中午饭，烘炉组五个同志围在一起研究生产问题，谈来谈去总感到人手不够，恐怕完不成任务。有人主张增添人手，有人不同意添人。正在争论的时候，车工组的同志们敲锣打鼓送来了毛主席语录，烘炉组的同志一看，大红纸上写着毛主席的这样一段话：“长江，别人都说很大，其实，大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。”同志们念完这条语录，顿时觉得一股热流通过全身，增添了克服困难的勇气和力量。大家激动地说：“感谢同志们的支援。”
    烘炉组把车工组送来的语录端端正正地贴在墙上，又反复学了几遍。张寿福同志说：“连美帝国主义我们都不怕，还怕什么困难，有毛泽东思想武装，就是再大的困难也能踢开。”大家一致表示：不用增添人了，就现有的五个人也要提前完成任务。过去五个人只能开两盘炉，现在五个人开了三盘炉。大家发扬勇敢战斗、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，终于出色地完成了生产任务。组长赵文瑞说：“千支援，万支援，送来毛主席语录，对我们是最大的支援。”
