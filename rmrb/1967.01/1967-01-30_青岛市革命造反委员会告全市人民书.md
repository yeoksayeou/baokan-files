The East is Red, the sun is rising. We solemnly declare, under the radiant morning sun, that the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee has been born! From this moment on, the political, economic, and cultural power of the entire city of Qingdao has been seized from the hands of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee, as well as the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. This is the great achievement of the brave struggle of the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses of the entire city over the past few months. It marks the beginning of a new stage in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao. This is another great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Let us wish our most, most great leader Chairman Mao a long, long life, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!

The great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, like a surging tide, is irresistible and rolls forward. The revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses of Qingdao, heeding the call of the great commander Chairman Mao—to care about state affairs and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end—have risen up to rebel against the old world. We have launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee. However, just as the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao were blazing fiercely, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee were terrified and panic-stricken. But after they regained their composure, they jumped out crazily, organized, planned, and deliberately staged the August 25 and September 1 counter-revolutionary incidents. They stood firmly on the bourgeois reactionary position, practicing bourgeois dictatorship over the revolutionary masses. They distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, encircled and suppressed the revolutionary leftists, labeling many revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," imposing white terror, and putting down the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao. They have committed unforgivable crimes against the people of the entire city of Qingdao.

When our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the great guidelines for the Cultural Revolution, the "Sixteen Points," and after the editorial in the thirteenth issue of the Red Flag magazine (1966) was published, the entire country was vigorously and openly attacking the bourgeois reactionary line. Those bourgeois officials, instead of sincerely repenting and admitting their crimes, became even more obstinate in clinging to the bourgeois reactionary line. They became more arrogant in opposing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. On the one hand, they gathered and organized their puppet "Red Guards" to launch a large-scale suppression of the revolutionary rebels. On the other hand, they did not hesitate to use the judicial organs to engage in espionage activities, even up to the end of last year, they continued to fabricate and harbor black materials, attempting to "settle accounts in autumn." They also used the pretext of "focusing on production" to suppress the revolution and strike at the revolutionary masses, preventing workers and peasants from rebelling against them. When the revolutionary workers and peasants exposed their plots and bravely rebelled, they transformed themselves into an ultra-leftist guise, using the pretext of "supporting the revolution" to incite in-service personnel to go out in large numbers to make complaints and engage in economism, squandering state funds and the blood and sweat of the people, launching a new wave of arrogant attacks on the proletarian dictatorship. They aimed to soften the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses, attempting to lead a serious political struggle astray into the path of economism. Recently, they have also promised positions and bribed the revolutionary rebels, attempting to split the revolutionary leftist forces. Under the guise of "actively supporting" the revolutionary demands of the masses, they have "demoted" a large number of grassroots cadres, blatantly undermining party policies, repeatedly staging the "sacrifice the pieces, protect the generals" farce, creating chaos, deceiving the masses, and using every means to exonerate themselves, aiming to protect their own interests.

They have been so extravagant with the state's funds and harmed the people's interests, all for the purpose of disrupting production, creating chaos, and putting pressure on the proletarian revolutionaries. They used the strategy of attacking to defend themselves, covering up their ugly souls, and protecting their own "official hats," launching a fierce counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We revolutionary rebels cannot remain silent and indifferent, and we cannot let their evil plots succeed!

Since the Cultural Revolution, the stormy waves of class struggle and the heart-rending twists and turns have deeply educated us revolutionary rebels, making us clearly see that the reason why this handful of reactionaries can launch wave after wave of fierce attacks and counterattacks against us from all sides is ultimately because they hold power. We revolutionary rebels, if we do not seize this power, we cannot achieve thorough liberation, we cannot thoroughly smash the counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line; if we do not seize power, we cannot complete the historical mission of struggle, criticism, and transformation, we cannot carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end; if we do not seize power, we cannot firmly grasp the destiny of the socialist revolution, the destiny of socialist construction, and the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship in our own hands; if we do not seize power, our socialist country will change color, the victory fruits won by countless revolutionary martyrs with their blood and lives for the party and the people will be in vain, and we will become criminals of history!

In short, we must seize power! Seize power!! Seize power!!! Only by seizing power can we thoroughly smash the strongholds of revisionism, and only then will there be a bright red socialist and communist new world!

The Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and the Qingdao Municipal People's Committee have long been in a state of paralysis under the powerful impact of the revolutionary tide. Currently, the political, economic, and cultural affairs of Qingdao are in a state of serious chaos. At the same time, some die-hard conservatives and impostors posing as "leftists" have taken the stage, creating rumors and confusion, attempting to sabotage the leftist forces, strike at the revolutionary masses, seize power, and seriously threaten the proletarian dictatorship, ruthlessly destroying the great democracy under the proletarian dictatorship, and obstructing the normal development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At this critical juncture, can we revolutionary rebels stand idly by? No, a thousand times no, ten thousand times no! We must and can only unite under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, on the common basis of the revolutionary rebel spirit, unite all revolutionary forces, rebel against the old Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee, seize their power, and firmly grasp all power in the hands of the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses! We have already done so.

Chairman Mao said, "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we resolutely smash all counter-revolutionary revisionist reactionary organizations and thoroughly destroy all reactionary capitalist dictatorship machines. Our Revolutionary Rebel Committee is a proletarian dictatorship organization led by the working class, with revolutionary workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, and cadres uniting on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. It will follow the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, breaking through the waves to advance towards socialism and communism!

"The iron gate of the pass is like iron, but now we take the first step to cross it." Our struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party is sharp, complex, and tortuous. We not only need to be good at seizing power but also good at exercising power. Although there are still many difficulties ahead of us, as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize the masses, respect the pioneering spirit of the masses, and unite all the masses who support the revolutionary rebels, establish a new revolutionary order, we will definitely be able to grasp the revolution and promote production, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. As Chairman Mao pointed out on the eve of the nation's victory, "The Chinese people will see that once the destiny of China is in the hands of the people themselves, China will, like the sun rising in the east, shine with its brilliant radiance over the land, quickly sweep away the muddy water left by the reactionary government, heal the wounds of war, and build a new, strong, and genuine People's Republic." We revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses will be the masters of the new Qingdao. Let the handful of capitalist-roaders and stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line tremble before the revolutionary people! The final victory will surely belong to us revolutionary rebels!

Let the revolutionary storm be more violent!

Let the proletarian revolutionary rebels unite, seize the power of the capitalist-roaders!

Long live the proletarian dictatorship!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand long lives to the great leader Chairman Mao!

　　青岛市革命造反委员会告全市人民书
    新华社济南二十九日电　青岛市革命造反委员会发表了《告青岛全市人民书》。全文如下：
      “东方红，太阳升”，我们迎着万丈朝霞庄严地宣告：青岛市革命造反委员会诞生了！从此，全青岛市的政治、经济、文化大权，由我们无产阶级革命造反派和革命群众，从青岛原市委、原市人委中的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的黑手中夺过来了。这是全市革命造反派和革命群众几个月来英勇斗争的伟大成果，是青岛无产阶级文化大革命进入一个崭新阶段的开端。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一新的伟大的胜利！让我们敬祝我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，犹如洪涛巨流，气势磅礴，滚滚向前。我们青岛革命造反派和革命群众听从伟大统帅毛主席的召唤——要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我们起来大造旧世界的反，向青岛市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起了猛烈的攻击。但是，正当青岛无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火迅猛地燃烧起来的时候，山东省委内和青岛市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派惊恐万状，惶惶不可终日。但当他们惊魂稍定之后，便疯狂地跳了出来，有组织、有计划、有目的地一手策划了“八·二五”、“九·一”反革命事件。他们顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，对革命群众实行资产阶级专政。他们颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命左派，把许许多多的革命群众打成“反革命”，实行白色恐怖，把青岛市轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命打了下去，对全青岛市人民犯下了不可饶恕的罪行。
    当伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定了文化大革命的伟大纲领“十六条”，以及《红旗》杂志（一九六六年）十三期社论发表以后，全国正雷厉风行、大张旗鼓地向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火的时候，那些资产阶级官老爷们，不但不痛改前非，低头认罪，反而变本加厉，顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线，更加猖狂地对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他们一面收罗和拼凑御用的“红卫兵”，大举围剿革命造反派；另一方面，则不惜动用政法机关，大搞特务活动，直到去年年底还不断编造、窝藏黑材料，妄图“秋后算账”。他们还假借“抓生产”的名义，压制革命，打击革命群众，不准工人、农民起来造他们的反。而当着革命工农群众揭穿了他们的阴谋，勇敢地起来造反之后，他们又摇身一变，以极“左”的面目出现，打着“支持革命”的幌子，纵容在职人员大量外出串连、“告状”，并且大搞经济主义，任意挥霍国家资财和人民血汗，向无产阶级专政发起了新的猖狂的进攻，阴谋软化革命群众的革命斗志，企图把一场严肃的政治斗争引向经济主义的邪路。最近，他们又对革命造反派封官许愿，笼络收买，企图分化革命左派队伍；并以“积极支持”群众的革命要求为名，大“罢”一般基层干部的官，肆无忌惮地破坏党的政策，一次又一次地导演“舍车马，保将帅”的骗局，制造混乱，捉弄群众，千方百计为自己开脱罪责，以达到保护自己的目的。
    他们如此慷国家之慨，损人民之利，无非是要破坏生产，制造混乱，对无产阶级革命派施加压力，用以攻为守的反革命策略，掩盖自己的丑恶灵魂，保住个人的“乌纱帽”，向以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线发起了猖狂反扑。我们革命造反派绝不能置若罔闻，袖手旁观，绝不能让他们的罪恶阴谋得逞！
    文化大革命以来，一场场惊涛骇浪的阶级斗争的暴风雨，和惊心动魄的反复，深刻地教育了我们革命造反派，使我们清楚地看到了这一小撮反动分子之所以能从各个方面，一次又一次地向我们发动猖狂的进攻和反扑，归根到底，就是因为他们手中有权。我们革命造反派，不夺这个权，就不能获得彻底解放，就不能彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的反扑；不夺权，就不能完成一斗二批三改的历史使命，就不能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；不夺权，就不能把社会主义革命的命运，社会主义建设的命运和无产阶级专政的命运，牢固地掌握在自己手中；不夺权，我们的社会主义国家就要变颜色，无数革命先烈为党为人民流血牺牲所换来的胜利果实，就要付诸东流，我们就要成为历史的罪人！
    总之，一句话，我们要夺权！夺权！！夺权！！！只有把权夺过来，才能彻底摧毁修正主义的顽固堡垒，才会有红彤彤的社会主义、共产主义新世界！
    青岛市委、青岛市人委在革命洪流的强有力的冲击下，早已处于瘫痪状态，当前青岛市的政治、经济、文化等事业都发生了严重的混乱。同时，一些保守组织的铁杆保“皇”分子和冒充“左派”的人物，纷纷粉墨登场，招摇过市，这些人抓住左派组织的某些缺点错误，大做文章，制造流言蜚语，混淆视听，混水摸鱼，在革命造反派内部制造反对派，企图瓦解左派队伍，打击革命群众，争夺政权，严重地威胁无产阶级专政，粗暴地破坏在无产阶级专政下的大民主，阻碍了无产阶级文化大革命的正常发展。在这样紧要关头上，我们革命造反派能置之不理吗？不能，一千个不能，一万个不能！我们必须也只能在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗的指引下，在革命造反精神的共同基础上联合起来，团结一切革命力量，造旧青岛市委、市人委的反，夺他们的权，把一切权力牢牢地掌握在革命造反派和革命群众的手中！我们现在已这样做了。
    毛主席说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”我们遵循毛主席的教导，坚决砸烂一切反革命的修正主义反动机构，要彻底捣毁所有反动的资本主义的专政机器。我们的革命造反委员会是以工人阶级为领导，革命工人、革命农民、革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部在毛泽东思想的基础上大联合的无产阶级专政的组织，它要沿着毛主席所开辟的革命航道，乘风破浪向社会主义、共产主义迈进！
    “雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。”我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，是尖锐的、复杂的、曲折的。我们不但要善于夺权，还要善于掌权。尽管在我们面前还有许多困难，但是，只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，把一切支持革命造反派的群众团结起来，建立新的革命秩序，一定能抓好革命，促好生产，巩固无产阶级政权。正如毛主席在全国胜利前夕所指出的那样：“中国人民将会看见，中国的命运一经操在人民自己的手里，中国就将如太阳升起在东方那样，以自己的辉煌的光焰普照大地，迅速地荡涤反动政府留下来的污泥浊水，治好战争的创伤，建设起一个崭新的强盛的名副其实的人民共和国。”我们革命造反派和革命群众要做新青岛的主人。让一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，在革命人民面前发抖吧！最后胜利一定属于我们革命造反派！
    让革命的暴风雨来得更猛烈些吧！
    无产阶级革命造反派联合起来，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
