Chairman Mao teaches us: "The sole purpose of this army is to serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly." The "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" embody the essence of our people's revolutionary army. Whether or not we can strictly carry out the policy of the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" is a measure of whether we can wholeheartedly serve the people and protect their interests at all times.

One day, our platoon went to work in the fields. Because we didn't have enough tools, we borrowed about sixty or seventy small hoes from the villagers. At noon, after finishing the work, the platoon leader told me and comrade Liu Zhuhe to return the hoes to the villagers. We went from house to house, and in the end, there was one hoe left whose owner we couldn't find. We walked around the village three times under the scorching sun, spending two hours, but still couldn't find any clues. By then, the troops had already left the village, the day was hot, and we were thirsty, so we hesitated. Should we hand the hoe over to the brigade and let the cadre find the owner? No, that would cause trouble for the cadre. Should we take it back and return it to the villager the next time we work? No, that wouldn't work either. Chairman Mao teaches us in the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention": "Return borrowed items." We cannot go against Chairman Mao's teachings. Besides, we had promised the villager that we would return the hoe by noon. If we didn't return it on time, it would affect the villager's work, which is a big deal! We discussed it and decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly," to "completely" and "thoroughly" carry out the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," without any discounts. So, we asked around the village a fourth time and finally found a villager who had locked his door earlier. We returned the hoe to him.

This incident made me realize: To carry out the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," one must have the mindset of wholeheartedly serving the people and a strong sense of responsibility towards the people. Only in this way can we truly achieve the goal of not taking even a single strand of hair from the people.

    全心全意为人民服务的尺子
    副班长　王景安
    毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”“三大纪律八项注意”，体现了我们人民革命军队的本质。能不能认真地执行“三大纪律八项注意”的政策，就是能不能全心全意为人民服务、处处维护人民利益的一把尺子。
    一天，我们连到田间劳动，由于工具不够，到社员家借了六七十把小锄头。中午锄完了地，排长叫我和刘柱和同志把锄头送还给社员。我们挨家挨户地送，最后剩下一把锄头找不到主人。我们又顶着烈日，在村里转了三趟，花了两个小时，还是没找着头绪。这时部队早已离开了村庄，天又热，口又渴，我们俩犹豫起来了。把这锄头交给大队让大队干部去找吧！不行，这样会增加大队干部的麻烦。带回去，等下次劳动时再还给社员吧，也不行。毛主席在“三大纪律八项注意”里教导我们：“借东西要还”，我们不能违反毛主席的教导。再说，事先就给社员说定了，中午一定送还，不按时送回，影响社员生产可是大事呀！我们商量了一下，决心按照毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导办事，要“完全”“彻底”地执行“三大纪律八项注意”，决不打折扣。于是，我们又第四次问遍各家各户，终于找到一家先前锁了门的社员，把锄头还给了他。
    这件事使我体会到：执行“三大纪律八项注意”，必须有全心全意为人民服务的思想，有向人民负责的高度责任感。只有这样，才能不折不扣地做到秋毫无犯。
