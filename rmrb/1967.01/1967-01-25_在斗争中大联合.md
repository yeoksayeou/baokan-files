In the midst of struggle, great unity

Beijing Jianhua Foundry "Red Rebel Brigade"
Central Institute of Finance and Economics "To the Workers and Peasants" Squad

Currently, the proletarian revolutionary factions, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, are moving towards great unity, forming an irresistible revolutionary torrent that is fiercely attacking the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. In the face of this great unity, the enemy is terrified and is making a desperate counterattack, using every means to sabotage the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions, attempting to make a final struggle. One side wants unity, the other opposes it; this is a serious class struggle.

Our Jianhua Foundry is right in the midst of this intense struggle. Over the past few years, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have used the Party power, state power, and financial power they have usurped to implement bourgeois dictatorship in our factory, pursue capitalist management policies, shield bad elements, and attempt to pull our factory onto the capitalist road. Anyone who dared to resist or raise a slight criticism was held in resentment, suppressed, and retaliated against, using methods such as withholding wages, disciplinary actions, demotion, dismissal, and expulsion to carry out suppression. Today, in the fierce battle to launch a general offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line, the class brothers who were previously expelled from the factory have risen up and rebelled! They rushed into the factory to post big-character posters, exposing the crimes of the power-holders taking the capitalist road. This revolutionary action is excellent! We, the red rebels, stand firmly with them, unite, and fight together.

In the face of such a good situation, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line are cornered and have stirred up the evil winds of economism, igniting the fires of sabotage against great unity. They fire "sugar-coated bullets" at the class brothers who have been harmed, pretending to care and saying, "I support you going to work tomorrow, but I have no power now, go find the Revolutionary Committee (revolutionary rebel organization)." They also spread rumors saying, "They (referring to the revolutionary rebels) won't let you work!" These people do this to lure some class brothers who are not clear about the truth to pursue personal temporary interests, leading a serious political struggle down the path of economism; at the same time, they create divisions among the revolutionary rebels inside and outside the factory, sabotaging the great unity of the revolutionary factions. In this way, they can absolve themselves of their crimes and shift the blame to us, the red rebels. It is indeed a three-in-one scheme, and their intentions are extremely malicious!

These people's tricks indeed caused temporary chaos. Some deceived class brothers outside the factory surrounded the Revolutionary Committee, and the stubborn forces inside the factory executing the bourgeois reactionary line took advantage of the situation, attempting to seize power back from the revolutionary factions, while the power-holders taking the capitalist road retreated to the background, watching the tigers fight.

Facing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, we, the red rebels, rose up with the mighty club of Mao Zedong Thought and struck back fiercely. We first exposed the tricks of the class enemies to the harmed class brothers, did meticulous political and ideological work on those who were deceived, raised their understanding of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and helped them see through the tricks of this handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road. The class brothers outside the factory, after realizing they had been deceived, angrily said, "We are following Chairman Mao to make revolution. We want to overthrow the power-holders taking the capitalist road and smash all capitalist old systems, not go back to work or collect wages! They want to use economism to buy us off and create divisions among us, absolutely not!"

Strong class sentiments and common revolutionary goals have made us, the revolutionary rebels, unite even more closely! We jointly held a rally to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and we brought out those who stirred up evil winds and ignited fires for struggle.

Under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, in the face of the united revolutionary rebels, the tricks of a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and those stubbornly executing the bourgeois reactionary line were thoroughly exposed! They "lifted the stone only to drop it on their own feet," and their ugly faces were even more exposed! The broad revolutionary rebels, through struggle, smashed the chains of counter-revolutionary economism, had a clearer direction for struggle, stronger confidence in struggle, and greater strength in struggle!

This struggle shows that the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions is the key to the proletarian seizure of power; without struggle, unity cannot be achieved; when the proletarian revolutionary factions unite, it is the time for the class enemies to be thoroughly annihilated!

"With remaining strength, pursue the fleeing enemy; do not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We are determined to use the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions to repel all new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　在斗争中大联合

    当前，无产阶级革命派正在毛主席革命路线的指引下，走向大联合，汇成一股不可抗拒的革命洪流，猛烈地冲击着党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。在这个大联合面前，敌人怕得要死，疯狂反扑，千方百计地破坏无产阶级革命派的大联合，妄图进行垂死的挣扎。一个要联合，一个反联合，这是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    我们建华铸钢厂就是处于这场激烈的斗争中。过去几年来，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派利用被他们窃取的党权、政权、财权，在我厂实行资产阶级专政，推行资本主义经营方针，包庇坏人，招降纳叛，企图把我厂拉向资本主义的道路上去。谁要稍有反抗，提一点批评意见，他们就怀恨在心，打击报复，用扣压工资、处分、下放、解雇、开除等种种手段，进行镇压。今天，在向资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击的战火中，过去被他们排除到厂外的阶级兄弟们起来了，造反了！他们纷纷进厂贴大字报，揭露走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，这个革命行动好得很！我们红色造反者坚决和他们站在一起，联合起来，共同斗争。
    在这样的大好形势面前，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，狗急跳墙，煽起了经济主义的阴风，点起了破坏大联合的邪火。他们向受害的阶级兄弟发射“糖衣炮弹”，装出一副关心的样子说：“我支持你们明天就上班，但是我现在没有权了，你们去找革委会（革命造反派组织）吧。”并且散布流言蜚语说：“他们（指革命造反派）不给你们上班！”这些家伙这样做的目的，就是要引诱一些不明真相的阶级兄弟，去单纯追求个人的暂时利益，把一场严重的政治斗争，引向经济主义的歧途；同时，在厂内外革命造反派之间制造分裂，破坏革命派大联合，这样，他们就可以开脱自己的罪责，把矛头转移到我们红色造反派的头上。真是一箭三雕，其用心又何其毒也！
    这些家伙的阴谋诡计，果然造成了暂时的混乱。一些被蒙蔽的厂外阶级兄弟，包围了革委会，厂内那些执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固势力，又趁火打劫，妄想从革命派手中把权夺回去，而走资本主义道路的当权派，却退居幕后，坐山观虎斗。
    面对资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，我们红色造反者奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，给以迎头痛击。我们首先向受害的阶级兄弟揭穿阶级敌人的阴谋，对受蒙蔽的人进行细致的政治思想工作，提高他们对无产阶级文化大革命的认识，使他们看清了这是一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的鬼把戏。厂外的阶级兄弟们知道受骗上当以后，激愤地说：“我们是跟着毛主席干革命的，我们是要斗倒走资本主义道路的当权派，是要砸烂一切资本主义的旧制度，而不是什么复工、拿工资！他们妄想用经济主义来收买我们，离间我们，绝对办不到！”
    强烈的阶级感情，共同的革命目标，使我们这些革命造反者更加紧密地联合起来了！我们共同召开了粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑的誓师大会，把那些煽阴风、点邪火的坏家伙拉出来进行斗争了。
    在毛泽东思想的阳光照射下，在联合起来的革命造反者面前，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人的阴谋诡计被彻底戳穿了！他们“搬起石头砸自己的脚”，他们的丑恶嘴脸更加暴露了！而广大革命造反派通过斗争，砸烂了反革命经济主义的锁链，斗争方向更明了，斗争信心更强了，斗争力量更加壮大了！
    这场斗争说明，无产阶级革命派的大联合，是无产阶级夺权的关键；不经过斗争，就不能实现联合；无产阶级革命派联合起来之际，就是阶级敌人彻底灭亡之时！
  “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们决心用无产阶级革命派的大联合去打退资产阶级反动路线的一切新反扑，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
