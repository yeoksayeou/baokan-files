Overthrowing the mental idols is a great ideological revolution that the masses have undergone after studying Chairman Mao's works. In our area, the influence of feudal oppression was deep in the old society, and superstitions were rampant. Before liberation, every household worshipped Buddha, people carried Buddha amulets, and even the fire pits had Buddha statues. After liberation, we overthrew the landlords and stood up; but the superstitions left over from the old society had not been completely eradicated from people's minds. Through various rounds of socialist education, the masses' ideological awareness has greatly improved, and fewer people believe in gods and Buddhas; however, there are still some who, while not openly believing in gods and Buddhas, secretly hide Buddha statues. This feudal leader, the clay Buddha, has not been overthrown, it covers up class contradictions, binds people's thoughts, and hinders the smooth progress of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. We advocate class struggle, but some people think that poverty and wealth are predetermined by fate; we advocate hard work to achieve a bumper harvest, but some people invite lamas to chant scriptures and pray for a smooth year; we call for fighting against nature, but some people say they rely on heaven for food. Is it relying on the Party's leadership, or relying on the blessings of gods and Buddhas? Is it relying on revolutionary struggle, or leaving it to fate? This is a fierce struggle between two classes and two worldviews.

How to wage this struggle well? Chairman Mao said: "The Buddha is set up by the peasants, and at a certain time, the peasants will throw away these Buddhas with their own hands, without others prematurely taking the lead to discard the Buddhas." The ideological class struggle cannot be solved by issuing orders, but must be resolved through enlightenment and education, raising the masses' awareness, and relying on the masses to revolutionize themselves. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we organized the community members to repeatedly study the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," which deeply educated the masses. They understood that: at that time, the peasants in Hunan were destroying temples and overthrowing clay Buddhas while fighting against the local tyrants and dividing the land, because the clay Buddhas could not save the peasants, and the peasants wanted to liberate themselves, they could only rise up and make a revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party. The community members discussed: "As early as more than thirty years ago, Chairman Mao praised us peasants for breaking away from superstitions and called on us peasants to rise up in revolution. How much he cares about our peasants' affairs!"

Based on the improvement of awareness, further guide the masses to use the perspective of class struggle to completely unravel the knots of feudal superstitions. A 60-something-year-old named Baolidao said: "What Buddha or no Buddha, it's all nonsense. I have worshipped the Buddha for decades, I don't know how much incense paper and butter I have wasted, but it has not given me any benefit. In the past, the poor had no clothes to wear, and the Buddha did not give a single piece of clothing; we were so hungry that our stomachs were rumbling, but it never gave us a single bowl of rice. The ones who truly liberated us were the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." After the masses saw through the Buddha statues and understood the essence of class oppression, they all stood up to overthrow feudal superstitions. A 60-something-year-old named Zhang Qibu took the Buddha statues to the cultural room for exhibition as a negative example and said: "I will not be deceived again, let everyone have a good look, and never believe in clay Buddhas again." Tegasiji, who has been telling fortunes and predicting good and bad omens for decades, also burned his "divination books" and decided to quit. People freed themselves from the shackles of feudal superstitions, their minds were liberated, and socialist new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits were greatly promoted.

    搬倒思想上的泥菩萨

    搬倒泥菩萨，是群众学习毛主席著作后的一个思想大革命。我们这一带，在旧社会受封建统治压迫较深，迷信思想很浓厚。解放前家家供佛，人身上带着佛，连火盆里边也有佛。解放后，斗倒了地主，翻了身；可是旧社会遗留下来的迷信思想，在人们头脑里没有彻底清除掉。经过历次的社会主义教育，广大群众的思想觉悟大大提高了，信神拜佛的人少了；但是也还有一部分人，表面上不信神佛，却暗地藏着佛像。泥菩萨这个封建头头没有搬倒，它掩盖了阶级矛盾，束缚着人们的思想，妨害阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的顺利开展。我们主张阶级斗争，有人却认为贫富在命；我们主张艰苦奋斗，夺取丰收，有人却请喇嘛念经祝愿一年平顺；我们号召战天斗地，有人就讲靠天吃饭。是靠党的领导，还是靠神佛保祐？是靠革命斗争，还是听天由命？这是一场两个阶级、两种世界观的激烈斗争。
    怎样搞好这个斗争？毛主席说：“菩萨是农民立起来的，到了一定时期农民会用他们自己的双手丢开这些菩萨，无须旁人过早地代庖丢菩萨。”思想上的阶级斗争不能用下命令的办法去解决，必须通过启发教育，提高群众觉悟，靠群众起来自我革命。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们组织社员反复学习《湖南农民运动考察报告》，对群众教育很深。他们懂得了：湖南农民当时一边打土豪分田地，一边拆毁祠堂、搬倒泥菩萨，就是因为泥菩萨救不了农民，农民要解放自己，只有在共产党的领导下，起来闹革命。社员们议论说：“早在三十多年前，毛主席就赞扬咱们农民打破迷信，叫咱们农民起来革命，他老人家对咱们农民的事情，是多么关心啊！”
    在提高认识的基础上，进一步引导群众用阶级斗争的观点，彻底解开封建迷信的扣子。六十多岁的宝力道说：“什么佛爷不佛爷的，都是瞎扯。我供了几十年佛爷，不知道浪费了多少香纸、黄油，它没给我一点好处。过去穷人没有衣服穿，佛爷没给一件衣服；我们饿得肚子直叫唤，它也没给过一碗饭。真正解放我们的，还是共产党、毛主席。”当群众透过佛像，看到了阶级压迫的本质以后，就纷纷起来革封建迷信的命。六十多岁的张其布把佛像拿到文化室去作反面教材展览后，说：“我再也不受骗了，叫大家好好看看吧，以后再也不要相信泥菩萨了。”几十年来给人家看风水、卜吉凶的特格西吉力根，也烧毁了“卦书”，决心洗手不干了。人们摆脱了封建迷信的束缚，思想解放了，社会主义的新思想，新文化，新风俗，新习惯得到大大发扬。
