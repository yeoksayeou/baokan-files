Chairman Mao says: “Imperialism drives the peoples of the world to the great struggle to eliminate imperialism.”

The peoples of North America, Western Europe, and Oceania are awakening anew.

To shift difficulties and escape their predicament of being besieged internally and externally, and facing a desperate situation, the ruling cliques of the Western imperialist bloc led by the United States are launching a ferocious attack on the laboring people of their own countries. The exploitation and oppression of the laboring people are becoming increasingly severe. This cannot but make the class contradictions within these countries increasingly sharp, further promoting the revolutionary awakening of the broad masses of laboring people, and making them stand up to fight for their own immediate interests.

In the United States, the massive movement against the Vietnam War continued to develop throughout the year. More and more black and white laborers, based on their personal experiences, are beginning to see the intrinsic connection between the reactionary policies of the U.S. government at home and its aggressive policies abroad. The broad masses of youth resolutely refuse to fight in Johnson’s Vietnam War, and many black youth who refuse to go to South Vietnam to fight have clearly stated that they will stay in their own country to fight for liberation. At the same time, the struggle of 20 million black people against racial discrimination and for basic human rights has developed rapidly, beginning to take the path of self-defense with violence against the violent suppression of the ruling clique. In the summer of 1966, 38 major cities in the south and north of the United States successively witnessed large-scale black self-defense struggles. The strike movement of the broad masses of workers in the United States to oppose increased exploitation and deteriorating living conditions has also been unending. The strike wave has swept through many important industries, including some enterprises that specialize in producing military supplies for the Vietnam War. The movement against the Vietnam War, the black movement, and the workers’ movement are gradually merging into a mighty torrent, fiercely assaulting the domestic rule of U.S. imperialism.

The anti-U.S. movement and workers’ struggles in Western European countries and Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are also on the rise. In these countries, the mass movement against U.S. aggression in Vietnam is thriving. The working class of these countries is also fighting against the transfer of economic difficulties by their own governments and against the intensification of exploitation by the bosses: in Britain, the largest seamen’s strike in 55 years broke out in May and June of last year; in France, 7 million industrial workers went on strike in May, the largest in 13 years; in Italy, construction, shipbuilding, and metallurgical workers went on strike last year, each with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of participants.

It is particularly worth noting that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is widely spread among the laboring people and progressive intellectuals in Western countries and is increasingly penetrating their hearts. Many people are striving to study the works of Chairman Mao, and the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought is illuminating the path of struggle for the peoples of these countries. In the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, the Marxist-Leninist forces in these countries are growing and strengthening: the Communist Party of Belgium, the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist), and the Communist Party of New Zealand are conducting unyielding struggles against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries in their own countries, and they enjoy high prestige among the masses; a new Marxist-Leninist party was established in Italy last year; and a series of Marxist-Leninist organizations have also emerged in North America and several Western European countries. These new-type Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations are the leadership cores of the revolution in these countries, representing the future and hope of the peoples of these countries.

All this confirms and is further confirming Chairman Mao’s profound judgment: “The proletariat and laboring people of Europe, North America, and Oceania are in a new awakening. The U.S. imperialists and all other harmful creatures have already prepared their own gravediggers, and the day of their burial will not be far off.”

    毛主席说：“帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。”
    北美西欧和大洋洲人民在新觉醒中
    为了转嫁困难，摆脱内外交困、日暮途穷的窘境，以美国为首的西方帝国主义阵营各国的统治集团正在向本国劳动人民发动猖狂进攻。劳动人民所受的剥削和压迫日益加剧。这就不能不使这些国家内部的阶级矛盾越来越尖锐化，从而进一步促进广大劳动人民的革命觉醒，使他们起来为保卫自己的切身利益而斗争。
    在美国，人民反对侵越战争的波澜壮阔的运动，去年一年继续发展。越来越多的黑人和白人劳动者根据切身经验，开始认清美国政府在国内的反动政策同它在国外的侵略政策之间的内在联系。广大青年坚决拒绝替约翰逊政府的侵越战争卖命，许多拒绝去南越作战的黑人青年还明确宣布，他们要留在本国为争取解放而斗争。同时，两千万黑人群众反对种族歧视、争取基本人权的斗争，获得了迅猛的发展，开始走上以暴力自卫反对统治集团暴力镇压的道路。在一九六六年夏天的三个月里，美国南北有三十八个重要城市先后爆发了规模壮观的黑人暴力自卫斗争。美国广大工人群众为了反对剥削加剧和生活条件恶化而掀起的罢工斗争，也绵延不绝。罢工浪潮波及了许多重要行业，包括一些专门替侵越战争生产军事物资的企业。人民反对侵越战争的运动、黑人运动和工人运动正逐渐汇合成为一股巨流，猛烈冲击着美帝国主义的国内统治根基。
    西欧各国和加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰人民的反美运动和工人斗争也在高涨。在这些国家里，人民反对美国侵略越南的群众运动，蓬勃发展。这些国家的工人阶级还为抗议本国政府转嫁经济困难、反对资方加紧剥削而展开斗争：在英国，去年五、六月间爆发了五十五年来最大的一次海员大罢工；在法国，七百万产业工人去年五月间举行了十三年来最大的一次罢工；在意大利，建筑、造船、冶金工人去年都分别举行了有数十万人或百万人参加的大罢工。
    特别值得指出的是，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在西方国家的劳动人民和进步知识分子中间广泛传播，越来越深入人心。许多人正在努力学习毛主席著作，毛泽东思想的光辉正照亮着这些国家人民斗争的道路。在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，这些国家的马克思列宁主义力量正在成长壮大：比利时共产党、澳大利亚共产党（马列主义者）和新西兰共产党为反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和本国反动派进行坚持不渝的斗争，它们在群众中享有崇高的威望；意大利去年新成立了马克思列宁主义政党；在北美和西欧不少国家中也出现了一系列马克思列宁主义组织。这些新型的马克思列宁主义政党和组织是这些国家革命的领导核心，代表着这些国家人民的未来和希望。
    所有这一切都证实了并且正在进一步证实毛主席的这一英明论断：“欧洲、北美和大洋洲的无产阶级和劳动人民，正处在新的觉醒之中。美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”
