The first batch of 2,500 copies of the French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" that arrived in Brussels has been enthusiastically welcomed by the Belgian working people. After the books were delivered to the bookstores, they sold out within a few days.

In the Belgian Communist Party, the Belgian Communist Youth and Student Organizations, and other mass organizations, many workers and students are diligently and enthusiastically studying and discussing Chairman Mao's quotations, deeply understanding the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and using it as a guide for action and practice. The frequent lectures held by these organizations on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao are also very popular among the audience.

The January 13 issue of the weekly "Voice of the People" published an article calling on readers to have a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This weekly also published Mao Zedong's work "In Memory of Norman Bethune."
