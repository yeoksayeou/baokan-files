	South West African Nationalists Congratulate Chairman Mao's Brilliant Victory in the Revolutionary Line
	All Revolutionary People Should Learn from the Chinese Revolutionary Rebels
	Firmly Support the Revolutionary Actions of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebels

	Xinhua News Agency Cairo, January 25th

	The representatives of the South West African People's Organization (SWAPO) in Cairo, Moses and Veyi, jointly wrote a letter to the Xinhua News Agency correspondent here on the 24th, enthusiastically hailing the revolutionary actions of the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels and the rise of the revolutionary peasant movement.

	The letter states: "This is a brilliant victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao Zedong, a brilliant victory for the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, and a shameful defeat for the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line."

	The two representatives expressed in the letter their firm support for the revolutionary actions of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters and other revolutionary mass organizations, as well as their emergency announcements and two open letters to the people of Shanghai.

	The letter says that the current rise of the revolutionary peasant movement "directly deals another blow to the economic revisionism of counter-revolutionary revisionism. We enthusiastically hail the active response of all revolutionary rebel masses in China to the magnificent mass movement and revolutionary peasant movement of the proletarian revolutionary rebels in the Shanghai area."

	The letter says that the victory of the Chinese proletarian revolutionary line "is a severe blow to U.S. imperialism and its biggest lackey, the number one accomplice—the Khrushchev revisionist leadership clique, the reactionaries, and all kinds of traitors."

	The letter says: "The African people, who are engaged in a fierce life-and-death struggle against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and the treacherous modern revisionism, are delighted by the new victories achieved by tens of millions of Chinese revolutionary rebels under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, while the enemies of the African revolution are saddened." The letter says: "U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and their old and new followers realize that People's China is the main and unbreakable fortress of socialism and the world proletarian revolution, and the biggest obstacle to their sinister plot of collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to dominate the world. Therefore, they always hope and conspire to change the color of China, to subvert it from the outside and inside, and attempt to cause the greatest damage to the world revolutionary cause."

	The letter says that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a very glorious and pioneering revolution, "it will inevitably have an impact on the future of the world and the destiny of mankind."

	The letter calls on revolutionaries of all countries to learn from the tens of millions of Chinese revolutionary rebels, to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to enthusiastically promote his works, to bravely defend his teachings, and to resolutely fight against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and modern revisionism.

	The letter concludes with the slogans: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

　　西南非洲民族主义者祝贺毛主席革命路线的辉煌胜利
　　各国革命者要向中国革命造反派学习
　　坚决支持上海工人革命造反派的革命行动
    新华社开罗二十五日电　西南非洲民族联盟驻开罗的代表莫塞斯和维伊二十四日联名给这里的新华社记者写了一封信，热情欢呼上海工人革命造反派的革命行动和革命农民运动的兴起。
    这封信写道：“这是以毛泽东主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的辉煌胜利，是中国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利，也是资产阶级反动路线的新反扑的可耻失败。”
    这两个代表在信中表示坚决支持上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命群众组织的革命行动，以及他们发出的《紧急通告》和两个《告上海全市人民书》。
    信件说，目前革命农民运动的兴起，“直接给予反革命修正主义的经济主义又一次打击。我们热情欢呼全中国一切革命造反派群众积极响应上海地区无产阶级革命造反派轰轰烈烈的群众运动和革命农民运动”。
    信件说，中国无产阶级革命路线的胜利，“是对美帝国主义及其最大的走狗、头号帮凶——赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团、反动派和各式各样叛徒的一个狠狠的打击”。
    信件说：“正在同帝国主义、新老殖民主义和阴险的现代修正主义进行激烈的生死搏斗的非洲人民，对千百万中国革命造反派在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下取得的这些新胜利感到欢欣鼓舞，而非洲革命的敌人则感到悲哀。”信件说：“美帝国主义和苏共叛徒领导集团及其新旧追随者意识到人民中国是社会主义和无产阶级世界革命的主要的、牢不可破的堡垒，是美苏勾结称霸世界这一阴险图谋的最大的障碍。所以他们总是希望、并阴谋使中国变色，从外部和内部来颠覆它，企图给世界革命事业以最大的损害。”
    信件说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是一场极为光荣和具有首创精神的革命，“它必然要对世界的未来和人类的命运发生影响。”
    信件呼吁各国的革命者向中国千百万革命造反派学习，用毛泽东思想武装自己，照毛主席的指示办事，热情宣传他的著作，勇敢捍卫他的教导，坚决地为反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和现代修正主义而斗争。
    信件最后高呼：毛主席万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
