Our friends are all over the world. "Within the realm, there are friends; across the sea, they are as close as neighbors." The great Chinese people and more than ninety percent of the people around the world are connected heart to heart. China will never be isolated. As our great leader Chairman Mao has taught us, all the people of the world, including the American people, are our friends.

The revolutionary people of the world deeply feel the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought. Through their interactions with the Chinese people, they have come to understand the glorious achievements of the Chinese people in their socialist revolution and construction, and they have seen the future of the world. The people of the world look towards Mao Zedong and Beijing. They are determined to follow the Chinese path, to unite with the Chinese people, to fight together, and to win together.

The Chinese people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible. China's friends are all over the world.

China and Albania are separated by mountains and seas, but high mountains cannot block the fighting unity, and the sea cannot separate the brotherly friendship. The peoples of China and Albania will forever be united, fight together, and win together. This is the Albanian people enthusiastically welcoming Chinese guests.

Following Mao Zedong, the world will be red. Revolutionary people love to read Chairman Mao's books and listen to Chairman Mao's words. This is a member of the Lao Patriotic Front's cultural troupe (second from the left) and the Red Guards studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together.

The revolutionary people of the world are overjoyed by China's successful missile and nuclear weapons tests. They shout the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and celebrate the glorious achievements of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. This is the people of Hanoi, Vietnam, gathering to enthusiastically celebrate China's successful missile and nuclear weapons test on October 27.

Many foreign friends have studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and are determined to make the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people their own. This is an American friend (right) and a French friend (left) working with the commune members in China.

China will always stand on the side of the oppressed people, and its friendly relations with the peoples of all countries continue to develop. This is a Yemeni woman warmly holding the hand of a Chinese actor visiting there, sharing the deep affection between the peoples of China and Yemen.

Foreign friends highly praise the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, daring to venture, and daring to do of the Chinese working class under the leadership of Chairman Mao. This is a representative attending the Afro-Asian Writers' Emergency Conference visiting the Shanghai Industrial Exhibition, observing the large gantry guideway grinder designed and manufactured in just over a year by the Shanghai Heavy Machine Tool Factory.

The great Chinese Cultural Revolution has shaken the world. Foreign friends celebrate the great victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution and praise the immortal achievements of the Red Guards. This is a New Zealand friend chatting with the Red Guards.
