The great leader Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast to the entire country the "Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" issued by the revolutionary mass organizations of Shanghai. This great strategic measure marks the beginning of a new stage in our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The "Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" are the products of the great alliance of revolutionary leftists with the revolutionary organizations of the Shanghai working class as the core. This fact fully illustrates the possibility and significance of the great alliance of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat.

Only through a great alliance can the mighty power of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat be fully displayed, can the enemy be most effectively isolated, and can the enemy be most effectively struck.

Only through a great alliance can the power in the hands of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party be finally seized, can the dictatorship of the proletariat be strengthened, and can the great democracy of the proletariat be guaranteed.

Only through a great alliance can the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the fate of the socialist economy be firmly grasped in our own hands.

In a word, only the great alliance of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat can carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The great alliance of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat is determined by their common struggle goals and common revolutionary interests. The great alliance of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat is not only an organizational alliance but more importantly, a unity of thought, a unity in the invincible great thought of Mao Zedong.

After going through a period of arduous and intense struggle and achieving victory, we have seriously studied "Rectification of Errors in Party Work" and listened to Chairman Mao's teachings, feeling more intimate than ever. Although the current situation is different from that of the Red Army, our struggle is not primarily a military struggle to seize power but a struggle to seize power in politics, economy, ideology, and culture under the dictatorship of the proletariat; however, the long-term nature of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie determines that this brilliant work is completely applicable to the current situation. It cannot be said that the thoughts of every member of our ranks have already been completely proletarianized.

Have we all overcome individualism? No, some people still have not broken away from the "self" in their hearts. Their thoughts of fame and gain will emerge at the right opportunity. For example, they cannot withstand the test in the face of the counter-revolutionary economic wind and cannot resist the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeois reactionary line, falling into the trap of the bourgeois reactionary line. This is a minority, but it is enough to cause our attention.

Have we eliminated all sectarianism? No, some people, in everything, consider more about the interests of their own group, vie for positions, and vie for power. They even exclude and strike other revolutionary organizations. This situation, as Chairman Mao pointed out, is "only paying attention to the interests of one's own small group, not paying attention to the overall interests, appearing to be for the collective but actually containing extremely narrow individualism." This sectarianism is a corrosive agent that weakens the organization and weakens the fighting capacity.

Have we eliminated all subjectivism? No, some of our comrades are satisfied with the spectacular, only want to do big things, do not want to do hard and patient mass work, do not do or do not want to do careful investigations and research, therefore, the analysis of the current class struggle situation is either overestimating the enemy's strength or underestimating the strength of the revolutionary masses, and thus it is impossible to give appropriate guidance to the current struggle.

In short, some of our comrades have not yet put proletarian politics in a prominent position in the struggle, have not yet put Mao Zedong Thought in a prominent position, and in the struggle, it is not "public" that comes first, but "private."

The contradictions within the revolutionary rebels are due to the lingering influence of bourgeois and feudal class thoughts in our minds. The current struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line will inevitably be reflected in our ranks.

Of course, the problems existing within the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat are not the essence or the mainstream of the matter but are non-essential and non-mainstream. Our mainstream is the unity of various revolutionary mass organizations, united on the basis of the great thought of Mao Zedong. However, to thoroughly defeat the new counterattack by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and to seize the final victory, we should seriously deal with the problems existing within the revolutionary rebels. We revolutionaries never hide our shortcomings; we dare to touch the soul in the struggle. We know that the higher the Party and Chairman Mao evaluate us, the more strictly we should demand of ourselves. We should take the serious study of the brilliant work "Rectification of Errors in Party Work" as a battlefield training, take this brilliant work as the program for the great alliance of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, purify and consolidate our ranks. We believe that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely build a highly revolutionary and highly proletarian fighting force.

The enemy is most afraid of our unity, and we must unite!

The enemy is most afraid of our solidarity, and we must be united!

Comrades of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, let us hold high the great red banner of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, unite more broadly and unite more closely in the new struggle, let the enemy tremble, collapse, and perish in the face of our great unity and solidarity!

### 联合的基础　夺权的保证

　　联合的基础　夺权的保证
　　新北大捍卫毛泽东思想战斗团　红文
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自决定向全国广播上海市革命群众组织发表的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，这一伟大的战略措施，标志着我国无产阶级文化大革命开始了一个新阶段。
    《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》是以上海工人阶级革命组织为核心的革命左派大联合的产物。这个事实充分说明了无产阶级革命派大联合的可能性及其重要意义。
    只有大联合，才能最充分地显示出无产阶级革命派的伟大力量，才能最大限度地孤立敌人，最有效地打击敌人。
    只有大联合，才能最终地把一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派手中的权夺过来，加强无产阶级专政，保障无产阶级的大民主。
    只有大联合，才能把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里。
    一句话，只有无产阶级革命派的大联合，才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    无产阶级革命派的大联合，决定于他们共同的斗争目标，共同的革命利益。无产阶级革命派的大联合，不仅仅是组织上的联合，更重要的是思想上的统一，统一于战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想。
    我们在经过前一个时期艰苦紧张的战斗并取得胜利之后，认真地学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，聆听毛主席的教导，更加感到分外的亲切。虽然现在的情况，和当时红军的情况不一样，我们的斗争不是以军事斗争为主的夺权斗争，而是在无产阶级专政条件下从事政治、经济、思想、文化的夺权斗争；但是无产阶级与资产阶级斗争的长期性，决定了这一光辉著作是完全适合于当前的情况的。不能说我们队伍中每个成员的思想都已经是纯粹的无产阶级化了。
    难道我们每个人都已克服个人主义了吗？不，有些人心中的私字还没有破，他们的名利思想，一遇时机便表现出来。例如在反革命经济主义黑风面前就经不起考验，经不住糖衣炮弹的攻击，上了资产阶级反动路线的当。这当然是少数人，但也足以引起我们的重视。
    难道我们就没有小团体主义了吗？不，有些人，一事当先，较多地为本团体打算，争位，争权。甚至对别的革命组织进行排斥，打击。这种情况，正如毛主席一针见血地指出的：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义”。这种小团体主义是削弱组织，削弱战斗力的销蚀剂。
    难道我们都没有主观主义了吗？不，我们有些同志，满足于轰轰烈烈，只想大干，不愿意艰苦地耐心地做群众工作，没有或不愿做仔细的调查研究，因此，对当前阶级斗争形势的分析，不是过高地估计敌人的力量，就是过低地估计了革命群众的力量，因而对于当前斗争也就不可能作出恰如其分的指导。
    总之，我们有些同志在斗争中还没有很好地突出无产阶级政治，没有很好地突出毛泽东思想，在斗争中不是“公”字当头，而是“私”字当头。
    革命造反派内部矛盾的产生，是由于在我们的头脑中多少残存着资产阶级、封建阶级思想的影响。当前无产阶级革命路线与资产阶级反动路线的斗争，也必然会反映到我们队伍里来。
    当然，无产阶级革命派内部存在的问题，不是事情的本质方面、主流方面，而是非本质、非主流方面。我们的主流是各革命群众组织的团结一致，团结在伟大的毛泽东思想基础上。但是为了彻底打垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的新反扑，为了夺取最后的胜利，我们应该认真地对待革命造反派内部存在的问题。我们革命者从不隐瞒自己的缺点，我们勇于在斗争中触及灵魂。我们知道，党和毛主席对我们评价愈高，我们就愈要严格地要求自己。我们应该把认真学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作作为严肃的战地整训，把这篇光辉著作作为无产阶级革命派大联合、纯洁和巩固我们队伍的纲领。我们相信，在毛泽东思想的指引下，一定能够建立起一支非常革命化、非常无产阶级化的战斗队伍。
    敌人最怕我们联合，我们就是要联合！
    敌人最怕我们团结，我们就是要团结！
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，让我们高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在新的战斗中，更广泛地联合起来，更紧密地团结起来，让敌人在我们的大联合大团结面前发抖吧！崩溃吧！灭亡吧！
