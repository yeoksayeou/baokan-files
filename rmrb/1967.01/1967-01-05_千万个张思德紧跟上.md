	Millions of Zhangs Think De Follow
	Worker Hu Longkun gently opens the first page, where it says "Hero Zhang Think De." Looking at the book, I think of the hero, and my heart burns with passion. Gazing at the charcoal kiln, spring is everlasting, and the hero's red flower never fades. Studying the treasure book, studying the hero, the more I study the treasure book, the redder my heart becomes. My heart flies over ten thousand mountains, the treasure book leads me to Yan'an. Yan'an, Anse has a sea of trees, rows and rows of green poplar saplings. Touching the saplings, I ask, "How did the revolutionary hero grow up?" The green poplar saplings raise their heads, pointing out the revolutionary path for me. Following the road to the charcoal kiln, it seems like Zhang Think De is burning charcoal. The roaring charcoal fire is so prosperous, the glowing red fire warms the heart. Mountains and rivers are reflected in the fire, and a song of praise has already been composed. I hear the Yan River singing loudly, singing about Zhang Class Leader: Zhang Think De listens to Chairman Mao's words the most, taking big strides on the revolutionary road. He gives his red heart to the people, carrying heavy burdens for the revolution. I see the high Baota Mountain, pointing to the blue sky and writing a poem: Zhang Think De is a revolutionary screw, shining brightly wherever he is screwed in! I feel like I see the soldiers of yesteryears smiling and humming, listening to Zhang Class Leader talk about "revolution": "Revolution is not afraid of sacrifice, daring to give one's life for the people!" ... The heroic words ring out, each word is printed in my heart. With tears in my eyes, I read it over and over, and a great mountain stands before me. Zhang Think De stands tall like a green pine, his heart is so broad. Closing the book, I think in my heart, how do we climb the new person's peak? Learn from Zhang Think De's good example, sweep away all selfish thoughts. "Completely," "thoroughly" for the people, a "public" character shines with gold. The golden light shines on the revolutionary road, a lifetime of reading Chairman Mao's book. The revolutionary treasure book is close to my heart, my oath is written to the dear Party: One Zhang Think De leads the way, millions of Zhang Think Des follow closely!

    千万个张思德紧跟上
    工人　胡隆坤轻轻揭开第一页，写着英雄张思德。眼望着书本想英雄，想起英雄心里热。遥望炭窑春常在，英雄红花开不败。学宝书，学英雄，越学宝书心越红。心儿飞过了万重山，宝书引我到延安。延安安塞有林海，青棡树苗一排排。手摸着树苗问一声，革命英雄怎长成？青棡树苗把头露，为我指点革命路。沿着大路向炭窑看，好像张思德正在烧木炭。熊熊炭火多兴旺，团团红火暖心房。山山水水火中映，一首颂歌已谱成。我听见延河高声唱，声声唱的张班长：张思德最听毛主席的话，革命路上把大步跨。掏尽红心为人民，身挑重担干革命。我看见高高的宝塔山，指着蓝天写诗篇：张思德是革命螺丝钉，拧在哪里都亮晶晶！我像看见当年战士们笑吟
  吟，——在听张班长讲“革
  命”：“革命就不怕牺牲，敢为人民献生命！”……豪言壮语响当当，字字印到我心坎上。含着热泪读一遍，眼前耸立一泰山。张思德屹立像青松，他的胸怀多宽广。合上书本想在心，新人的高峰怎样攀登？学习张思德好榜样，私心杂念全扫光。“完全”、“彻底”为人民，一个“公”字闪金光。金光闪闪革命的路，一辈子都读毛主席的书。革命宝书贴在心窝上，誓言写给亲爱的党：一个张思德前面走，千万个张思德紧跟上！
