Strengthen Unity and Fight the Enemy Together

Red Revolutionary Alliance, Shanghai First Medical College Revolutionary Rebel Brigade, Wei Dong

Chairman Mao teaches us: “What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the thousands and tens of thousands of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, a wall that no force can break. It is completely unbreakable. … Around the revolutionary government, unite tens of thousands of masses, develop our revolutionary war, and we can annihilate all counter-revolutionaries, and we can seize all of China.”

Unity is strength. Revolutionary comrades must unify their thoughts and achieve great unity and great alliance. Only in this way can we isolate the enemy and concentrate our forces to strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. If our thoughts are not unified and our actions are not consistent, each doing their own thing, the enemy will have an opportunity to exploit. Especially at this time, the reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie, in order to preserve themselves, are using every means to obstruct and sabotage the unity and alliance of revolutionary rebel organizations, creating fake rebels. We must be highly vigilant and, on the premise of a unified direction, seek common ground on major principles and allow for differences on minor issues. We must firmly unite together, cooperate with each other, and fight together to utilize the enemy's contradictions and thus defeat the enemy.

Revolutionary rebels should have broad minds and far-sighted vision. However, some comrades now have serious “mountainheadism,” “localism,” and “independent kingdom” ideologies. They do not hesitate to gather a group and exclude another; they fabricate facts; they belittle others and elevate themselves; they disregard the overall situation and act as if they are the only ones who matter; they keep something in reserve to “show off their skills” in the future, and so on. In short, these comrades only see themselves and the small group they are in, and they do not see their comrades, friends, the entire class, and of course, they do not see all of humanity. This small-groupism is a reflection of bourgeois ideology within our ranks. In the brilliant document “On Rectifying the Party’s Erroneous Ideas,” Chairman Mao sharply criticizes this small-groupism as: “paying attention only to the interests of one’s own small group and not to the interests of the whole, appearing to be for the collective but actually containing narrow individualism, and having a great corrosive and centrifugal effect.”

In discussing revolutionary successors, Chairman Mao says: “They must be proletarian politicians who can unite the vast majority of people to work together.” We revolutionary rebels must heed Chairman Mao’s words, quickly unite and form a great proletarian cultural revolution army that can be called upon to come, fight, and win. We must unite all those who are willing to revolutionize, including those who have been temporarily deceived, and fight together to achieve victory.

Our unity is a highly principled unity, a unity that can only be based on Mao Zedong Thought, a unity that can only be under the banner of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. In the process of unity, struggle is inevitable. Unity and struggle are two sides of the same thing. To achieve unity, there must be serious struggle. Without criticism and struggle, there will be no real unity. A harmonious atmosphere without distinguishing right from wrong is compromise, it is liberalism. Such unity is false unity, not true unity. For bad tendencies, we must struggle; without struggle, there will be confusion of thought, the collective will become a loose sand, and the revolutionary cause will be harmed. To eliminate internal differences, we must start from the desire for unity, go through necessary criticism and struggle, so as to achieve new unity on a new basis.

The process of great unity and great alliance is also the process of eliminating bourgeois elements and promoting proletarian elements. We must respond to Comrade Lin Biao’s call to study the “Three Articles” thoroughly, completely eliminate private interests and establish public interests, regard ourselves as the driving force of the revolution, and also as the object of the revolution, so that we can jump out of the “I” range, see the big picture, consider the overall situation, fully appreciate the strengths of others, and seriously examine our own shortcomings. Only in this way can we truly unite and strive together.

### 加强团结　一致对敌

　　加强团结　一致对敌
　　红革会上海第一医学院革命造反兵团　卫东
    毛主席教导我们：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。……在革命政府的周围团结起千百万群众来，发展我们的革命战争，我们就能消灭一切反革命，我们就能夺取全中国。”
    团结就是力量。革命的同志一定要统一思想，实行大联合、大团结，只有这样才能孤立敌人，集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。如果思想不统一，行动不一致，你打你的，我打我的，敌人就有机可乘。特别是当前，资产阶级反动势力为了保存自己，正在千方百计阻挠和破坏革命造反派组织的联合和团结，搞假造反派，我们更应当保持高度的警惕，要在大方向一致的前提下，在原则问题上求同，在枝节问题上存异，牢牢地团结在一起，互相配合，协同作战，利用敌人的矛盾，从而克敌制胜。
    革命造反派应该胸襟广阔，目光远大。但是，现在有些同志“山头主义”“本位主义”“独立王国”的思想十分严重。他们不惜拉拢一批，排挤一批；不顾事实，无中生有；贬低对方，抬高自己；不顾全局，唯我独尊；自己留一“手”，以便将来“大显身手”等等。总之，这些同志只看到自己，只看到自己所在的小团体，看不到同志，看不到朋友，看不到整个阶级，当然就更看不到全人类了。这种小团体主义是资产阶级思想在我们队伍中的反映。毛主席在《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉文献中，尖锐地批评了这种小团体主义是：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”
    毛主席在论革命接班人中说：“他们必须是能够团结绝大多数人一道工作的无产阶级政治家。”我们革命造反派一定要听毛主席他老人家的话，迅速地联合起来，团结起来，形成一支召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜的无产阶级文化革命大军，团结一切愿意革命的同志，包括那些曾经一度受蒙蔽的人，共同战斗，共同夺取胜利。
    我们的团结是有高度原则性的团结，只能是在毛泽东思想基础上的团结，只能是在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的旗帜下的团结。在团结的过程中，斗争是不可避免的。团结和斗争是同一事物的两个方面。要团结，必须有严肃的斗争。没有批评和斗争，就不会有真正的团结。一团和气，不分青红皂白，是和稀泥，是自由主义。这样的团结是假团结而不是真团结。对于不良倾向，就要斗争，不斗争就会思想混乱，就会使集体变成一盘散沙，就会损害革命事业。为了消除内部的分歧，就必须从团结的愿望出发，经过必要的批评和斗争，以便在新的基础上达到新的团结。
    大联合、大团结的过程也是灭资兴无的过程。我们一定要响应林彪同志的号召，狠学“老三篇”，彻底破私立公，把自己当作革命的动力，又当作革命的对象，使自己跳出“我”字的范围，识大体，顾大局，充分估计别人的长处，认真检查自己的缺点，只有这样，才能真正团结起来，共同奋斗。
