Many workers, ordinary laborers, and progressives in Britain have enthusiastically hailed China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a great innovation in the world communist movement. In a letter, a British worker wrote passionately, "Chairman Mao is the living embodiment of Marxism-Leninism. He has greatly inspired all revolutionaries and oppressed peoples." He added, "We enthusiastically hail the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is a priceless treasure for all revolutionary peoples. We place our hopes in the Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers, and in the glorious Communist Party of China."

A British friend wrote in a letter, "The Communist Party of China, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has made a great contribution to Marxism-Leninism," and "Glory to the great Chairman Mao! We salute him!" A British laborer said that the Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has consolidated the achievements of the Chinese revolution, making a tremendous contribution to the oppressed and exploited peoples of the entire world.

    英国劳动人民和进步人士欢呼我国文化大革命
    文化大革命是世界共产主义运动的伟大创举
    据新华社伦敦电　英国许多工人、普通劳动者和进步人士热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命这一世界共产主义运动中的伟大创举。一个英国工人在一封来信中热情洋溢地说：“毛主席就是活生生的马克思列宁主义的化身，他大大地鼓舞了一切革命者和被压迫人民。”他还说：“我们热烈欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命，这是一切革命人民的无价之宝。我们把希望寄托在中国的工农兵和光荣的中国共产党身上。”
    一个英国朋友在一封来信中写道：“中国共产党通过无产阶级文化大革命，对马克思列宁主义作出了伟大的贡献”，“光荣归于伟大的毛主席，并向他致敬！”一个英国普通劳动者说，由毛主席亲自发动和领导的文化大革命巩固了中国革命的成果，从而为全世界被压迫和被剥削的人民作出了巨大的贡献。
