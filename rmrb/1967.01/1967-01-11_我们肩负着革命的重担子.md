We fully support the initiative of the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai. We revolutionary rebels listen to the Party the most, and we listen to Chairman Mao the most. We resolutely respond to and implement Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of our country's productive forces. All of us rebels deeply understand: if we do not thoroughly carry out this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, if we do not resolutely uproot the roots of revisionism, our production will lose direction and slip onto the capitalist road. We, the working class, are the leading class of the state and the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We bear the dual tasks of revolution and production. We must not only be the vanguard and backbone of the revolution but also the vanguard and backbone of production.

The capitalist-roaders within the Party in our factory have, in the past, used "promoting production" as a pretext to suppress the revolution. At the beginning, we rebels were the fewest in number. We actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." During work hours, we worked hard, and in our spare time, we wrote big-character posters to expose those capitalist-roaders within the Party and carry out the Cultural Revolution. They, however, organized the masses to attack us, saying we disrupted production. They put on a show of caring about production, but in reality, they cared most about their own positions. They feared the revolution and feared revolutionary students coming to the factory to unite with the workers, fearing it to death, but they did not fear failing to complete production tasks. To oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and extinguish the revolutionary flames, they played many tricks and hatched many conspiracies, such as striking down many department heads who dared to give them advice, and so on. They spread many rumors about the students who came to our factory for revolutionary connections and then, using "promoting production" as an excuse, made them work all day and dispersed them so that they could not participate in our factory's revolutionary activities.

After these conspiracies were exposed by the revolutionary masses, they lay down and did nothing, and incited and indulged a part of the workers who were poisoned and deceived by them to leave their production posts to "report grievances." They even used economic means to buy off the masses, attempting to reverse the direction of the movement. All of these were aimed at disrupting socialist production and the Cultural Revolution.

We revolutionary rebels have the clearest eyes and the brightest hearts. We must expose their conspiracies and not fall for their tricks. The more they try every means to disrupt the Cultural Revolution, the more we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end; the more they try every means to disrupt production, the more we must do a good job in production and realize Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." We believe that our class brothers who were temporarily poisoned and deceived by them and left their production posts will surely awaken, see the big picture, and understand the big issues, not forget the heavy responsibility we workers bear, return to their production posts, and return to Chairman Mao's correct line, working together with us to do a good job in the revolution and a good job in production. Let us, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the reactionary bourgeois line!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our beloved leader Chairman Mao!

    我们肩负着革命的重担子

    我们完全拥护上海革命造反派同志们的倡议，我们革命造反派的同志们最听党的话，最听毛主席的话，我们坚决响应和贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的指示。
    无产阶级文化大革命是促进我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。我们造反派的全体同志深深地懂得：不把这场无产阶级文化大革命搞深搞透，不坚决拔掉修正主义的老根，我们搞生产就会迷失方向，就会滑到资本主义的道路上去。我们工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。我们肩负着革命、生产的双重任务。我们不但要做抓革命的先锋和骨干，而且也要做促生产的先锋和骨干。
    我们厂的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，过去以“抓生产”为名，来压制革命。开始，我们造反派人数最少，我们积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，在劳动时积极干活，利用业余时间写大字报，揭发那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，进行文化大革命。他们却组织群众围攻我们，说我们破坏了生产。他们摆出一副关心生产的样子，其实他们最关心的是自己的乌纱帽。他们害怕革命，害怕革命的学生进厂与工人结合，简直怕得要死，但是就不怕完不成生产任务。他们为了对抗毛主席的革命路线，扑灭革命火焰，耍了很多花招，搞了很多阴谋。如打击敢于给他们提意见的许多科室干部等等。他们对来我厂进行革命串连的同学，造了不少谣言，接着又以“抓生产”为名，让他们整日劳动，并且把他们分散开来，使得他们无法参加我厂的革命活动。
    当这些阴谋被革命群众识破以后，他们就躺倒不干，并且挑动和纵容一部分受他们毒害和蒙蔽的工人群众，脱离生产岗位去“告状”。他们甚至用经济手段来收买群众，妄图扭转运动的大方向。所有这些，目的都是为了破坏社会主义生产，破坏文化大革命。
    我们革命造反派眼最明，心最亮。我们必须揭穿他们的阴谋，不上他们的当。他们越是想方设法破坏文化大革命，我们越要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把文化大革命进行到底；他们越是千方百计破坏生产，我们越要搞好生产，实现毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。我们相信一时受他们毒害和蒙蔽而脱离生产岗位的阶级兄弟们，一定会觉悟过来，认清大是大非，顾大局，识大体，不忘我们工人阶级肩负的重任，回到生产岗位上来，回到毛主席的正确路线上来，和我们一道共同搞好革命，共同搞好生产。让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，彻底摧毁资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    以毛主席为代表的革命路线胜利万岁！
    最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
