An unchanging socialist China will better fulfill its internationalist duties.

Ambassador Sin Wa Nao and Vice Premier Chen Yi jointly toasted to the further development of the "Paukphaw" friendship between the peoples of Myanmar and China.

BEIJING, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) — Ambassador of the Union of Myanmar to China, U San Wa Nao, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the independence of the Union of Myanmar.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo, and relevant officials Li Siguang, Xu Deheng, Fu Zuoyi, Yang Xiufeng, and Han Nianlong attended the reception at the invitation.

Ambassador Sin Wa Nao and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the reception, warmly celebrating the further development of the "Paukphaw" friendship between the peoples of China and Myanmar.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Myanmar has further developed in various aspects in recent years. The Chinese government and people will, as always, support the Union of Myanmar in opposing imperialism, safeguarding national independence, and pursuing a policy of peace and neutrality. We will also work together with the Myanmar government and people to strengthen and develop friendly cooperation between the two countries.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese people are full of confidence. In the new year, we will achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and strive for even greater achievements in the socialist revolution and construction. An unchanging socialist China will more effectively fight against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, more strongly support the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the peoples of the world in their struggle for world peace, national independence, people's democracy, and socialism, and better fulfill our glorious internationalist duties.

When talking about China's recent successful nuclear test, Vice Premier Chen Yi said that this is China's third nuclear test in the past year. The success of these nuclear tests is a significant contribution to the defense of world peace. China conducts necessary and limited nuclear tests and develops nuclear weapons solely for defensive purposes, aiming to ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons. Vice Premier Chen Yi solemnly declared once again that under any circumstances, China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Chinese people and government, as always, will continue to stand with all peace-loving peoples and countries around the world, steadfastly striving for the lofty goal of a comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons.

Ambassador Sin Wa Nao said in his speech that on the basis of the friendly and cooperative relations already established between the governments and peoples of the Union of Myanmar and the People's Republic of China, the two countries will continue to strengthen and develop more extensive and perfect friendly and cooperative relations.

Ambassador Sin Wa Nao praised that under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese government and people have achieved comprehensive and outstanding achievements in industry, agriculture, social life, and education. We are greatly inspired to see the seven hundred million Chinese people, firmly armed with Mao Zedong Thought, forging ahead to build a great new China.

Diplomats from various countries to China were also invited to attend the reception.

    陈毅副总理在讲话中说，中缅两国人民的传统友谊，近几年来，在各方面都有了进一步的发展。中国政府和人民将一如既往，支持缅甸联邦反对帝国主义、维护民族独立、奉行和平中立的政策，并且同缅甸政府和人民一道，为巩固和发展两国之间的友好合作关系而努力。
    陈毅副总理说，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，中国人民满怀信心，在新的一年中，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，争取社会主义革命和建设事业更加伟大的成就。一个永不变色的社会主义中国，将更有效地进行反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，更有力地支援亚非拉和全世界革命人民争取世界和平、民族独立、人民民主和社会主义的斗争，更好地完成我们光荣的国际主义义务。
