The red sun rises in the east,
The snow mountains and grasslands shine with golden light.
The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought,
Is the red sun in our hearts.
The sun in the sky warms the earth,
The sun in our hearts warms our hearts.
The highest peak is Mount Qomolangma,
The best book is Chairman Mao's works.
When climbing mountains, aim for the highest peak,
When reading books, read Chairman Mao's works.

    红太阳照雪山
    （藏族民歌二首）东方升起了红太阳，雪山草原闪金光。光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想，是我们心中的红太阳。天空的太阳暖大地，心中的太阳暖心房。最高的山峰是珠穆朗玛峰，最好的书是毛主席著作。登山要登最高的山，读书要读毛主席的书。
