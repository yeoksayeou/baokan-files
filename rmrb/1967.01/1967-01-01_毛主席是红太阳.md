Chairman Mao lives in Beijing,
The red sun hangs in our hearts.
The sun in the sky only shines during the day,
But the sun in our hearts shines day and night.
A red sun rises in the hearts of 700 million people,
We will be the vanguard on the revolutionary path.
What wind do we fear? What waves do we fear?
We dare to change the mountains and rivers into new attire.
A red sun rises in the hearts of the people of the world,
The winds and thunder of the five continents and four seas roar.
The anti-American war song soars to the heavens,
We vow to bury imperialism completely!
The red sun shines in our hearts,
Our bodies are filled with invincible strength.
We trample underfoot the demons and monsters,
We create a brand new world!

    毛主席是红太阳
    朝鲜族　尹今哲毛主席住在北京城，红太阳挂在咱们心坎坎上。天上的太阳只是白天照，心上的太阳日夜放光芒。七亿人民心中升起红太阳，革命的路上当闯将。怕什么风，怕什么浪，敢教河山换新装。世界人民心中升起红太阳，五洲四海风雷激荡。反美战歌冲云霄，誓把帝国主义统统埋葬！红太阳照在心坎坎上，浑身充满无敌的力量。牛鬼蛇神脚下踩，崭新的世界我们创！
