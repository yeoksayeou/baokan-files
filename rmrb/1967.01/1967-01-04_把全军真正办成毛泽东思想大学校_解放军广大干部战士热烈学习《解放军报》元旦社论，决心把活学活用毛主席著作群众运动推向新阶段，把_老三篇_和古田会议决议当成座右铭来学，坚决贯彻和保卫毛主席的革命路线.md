The broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are studying and discussing the New Year's editorial of the *People's Liberation Army Daily* with great fervor. They have resolved to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, to study the "Three Articles" and the resolutions of the Gutian Conference as guiding principles, and to resolutely carry out and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The New Year's editorial of the *People's Liberation Army Daily* was broadcast by central and local radio stations. From Heilongjiang to Hainan Island, from the Tian Shan Mountains to the shores of the East China Sea, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army gathered around their radios, excitedly listening to the broadcast. When they heard "We wish the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao a long life!" they enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years! Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!" After the broadcast, they spontaneously sang "The East Is Red" and "The Ship of the East." When the New Year's newspapers arrived at various units, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers eagerly read them. Everyone agreed that the editorial was excellent, representing Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao's call to arms for our army, giving us great encouragement. The editorial spoke to our hearts, expressing our boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and our boundless faith in the great, invincible, brilliant, and boundless Mao Zedong Thought. It is the order to mobilize our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought and the call to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. Everyone expressed their determination to carry out the glorious and arduous tasks proposed in the editorial. A soldier from a certain unit wrote a poem reflecting the sentiments of the broad masses of cadres and soldiers across the army: "The New Year's editorial reaches the barracks, the entire army is in high spirits. The Military Commission and the General Political Department issue the call, the direction on the road ahead is clear. Together we build a great school, each year more red than the last. Following the great helmsman Chairman Mao, we march at the forefront of the revolution."

Various military branches, units, and many leaders of various units organized study sessions and discussions after receiving the editorial. Everyone agreed that the editorial fully embodies Chairman Mao's military thought and military line, and Comrade Lin Biao's series of extremely important instructions on military construction. It is the general policy, general task, and general requirement proposed by the Military Commission and the General Political Department for the army's work in 1967. Propagating and studying the New Year's editorial will enable the entire army to act in accordance with the spirit of the editorial, working together to achieve this. This is the first battle of political and ideological work for the year, and it is crucial for fully implementing the requirements of the editorial and doing a good job in the army's work. This battle must be won. Many leaders went deep into the grassroots to explain the editorial to cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members. Many units organized propaganda teams to quickly perform cultural programs, using blackboards, wall newspapers, slide shows, and wired broadcasts to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda, making the spirit of the New Year's editorial known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts.

Through study and discussion, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers further saw the excellent situation of the current Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved great victories, and the bourgeois reactionary line has been declared bankrupt. A small number of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are increasingly isolated. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, combined with the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, has brought about a new high tide in the Cultural Revolution. The great Mao Zedong Thought is more widely spread than ever before, and a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and those demons and ghosts are submerged in the vast ocean of the revolutionary masses. The soldiers said: The situation of the Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is excellent. This movement is sweeping across the entire country with the force of a thunderstorm, shaking the world. The entire army expresses their determination to carry out and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to further criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, to actively participate in and defend the Cultural Revolution, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers used vivid examples to illustrate that in the past year, the entire army, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implemented the five principles of emphasizing politics proposed by Comrade Lin Biao, achieving great victories on both the spiritual and material fronts. In the magnificent Cultural Revolution, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works surged higher and higher. The "Three Articles" were widely studied and applied, achieving great results in breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and in transforming worldviews. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers increasingly deeply felt that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, our red sun in our hearts, the guiding principle for all work of the entire party and nation, the core, soul, and foundation of our military construction. Everyone expressed their determination to further ignite and enhance their class feelings for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, raising their understanding of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level. The study and application of Chairman Mao's works must be further grasped, more earnestly implemented, and strived for with greater effort, achieving new levels of study and application.

Through studying the editorial, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers further realized that the core issue of turning our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought is to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, oppose the bourgeois reactionary line, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform people's souls, and promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. Without Chairman Mao's correct line, one would definitely go astray. Everyone expressed their determination to study the "Three Articles" and the resolutions of the Gutian Conference as guiding principles, to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. A cadre from a certain unit who actively studies Chairman Mao's works, Deputy Platoon Leader Guo Xiaosi, said: "Studying the resolutions of the Gutian Conference as a guiding principle has extremely important practical significance in the current struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. Chairman Mao's brilliant work is the party's charter, the army's charter, an iron broom to sweep away the bourgeois reactionary line, and also an iron broom to sweep away the dirt and filth in our souls. On the road to turning our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot take a single step away from it." The pilots of the "Heroic Aviation Regiment" said in their discussion, "We must study and apply the 'Three Articles' extensively, perform 'surgery' on our souls, remove the root of selfishness, replace it with a heart that is completely and thoroughly dedicated to serving the people, and install a set of iron bones of the proletariat, marching towards the spiritual world of communism, becoming new people of communism."

Many leaders believe that to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, the key is for leaders to take the lead in studying and applying them well. A certain regiment's leaders said that the editorial points out that leaders going to the soldiers and the masses, studying and applying together with the soldiers and the masses, is very important. They explained with their personal experiences that going to the masses to transform one's thinking has many advantages: it allows the masses to better supervise and help oneself; it allows one to better learn from the masses, overcoming one's limitations and blind spots; leaders setting a good example in thought reform and in carrying out and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can better influence and promote the revolutionary construction of the troops. A certain unit's political instructor, Yin Yulu, said: "We must study the 'Three Articles' and the resolutions of the Gutian Conference as guiding principles, taking the lead in learning, taking the lead in shining, taking the lead in struggling, and taking the lead in transforming, becoming pioneers in thought reform."

After studying the editorial, various levels of leadership and platoons further realized that the creation of the Four Good Platoons movement is a fundamental measure to implement the resolutions of the 1960 Military Commission Enlarged Meeting and strengthen platoon construction. Many military units' party committees require leaders to go deep into reality, grasp the grassroots, emphasize politics, and firmly grasp and solve active thoughts, using Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve various real thought problems, creating more and better Four Good Platoons. Many platoon party branches, according to the requirements of the New Year's editorial, further revised their plans for creating Four Good Platoons, determined to pass the test of emphasizing politics, further strengthening the leadership of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate new people of communism, through the continuous development and improvement of the Four Good movement, turning the platoons into good schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to be good fighting teams, work teams, and production teams, combining military, agricultural, industrial, and civilian work; to follow Chairman Mao's teachings that "all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting will," to heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, firmly guard their battle positions, be ready at any time to smash the sudden attacks of American imperialism and its lackeys, be ready at any time to fight side by side with the Vietnamese people, annihilate the evil American aggressors, struggle for the liberation of Taiwan, defend the motherland, and support the world's people's revolution.

    把全军真正办成毛泽东思想大学校
    解放军广大干部战士热烈学习《解放军报》元旦社论，决心把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段，把“老三篇”和古田会议决议当成座右铭来学，坚决贯彻和保卫毛主席的革命路线
    新华社三日讯　中国人民解放军干部战士满怀革命激情，热烈学习和讨论《解放军报》一九六七年元旦社论。全军指战员热烈欢呼：毛主席万岁！以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！决心在新的一年里，坚决响应林彪同志的号召，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘无产阶级文化大革命的东风，把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段，把我军真正办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    一九六六年的除夕，从黑龙江到海南岛，从天山南北到东海之滨，人民解放军的广大干部战士聚集在收音机旁，兴奋地收听中央和各地广播电台传来的《解放军报》一九六七年元旦社论。当干部战士在广播中听到“我们敬祝伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万寿无疆”时，热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！毛泽东思想万岁，万万岁！”听完广播后都情不自禁地高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》。元旦的报纸送到各个单位的时候，广大干部战士争相阅读，大家一致认为，这篇社论好得很，是代表毛主席和林彪同志对我军发出的新的战斗号召，给了我们极大的鼓舞。这篇社论字字句句说到了我们的心坎上，表达了我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，表达了我们对伟大的，战无不胜的，光芒万丈的，光焰无际的毛泽东思想的无限信仰；是把我军办成毛泽东思想大学校的动员令，是把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段的进军号。大家表示：一千个赞成，一万个照办，决心为实现社论中提出的光荣、艰巨的任务而奋斗。某部战士写的一首诗，反映了全军广大干部战士的心情：“元旦社论传军营，全军上下齐欢腾。军委总政发号召，前进路上方向明。齐心同建大学校，一年更比一年红。紧跟统帅毛主席，革命路上打先锋。”
    各军种、兵种，各部队的党委和许多单位的领导干部接到社论以后，立即组织了学习和讨论。大家认为，社论充分体现了毛主席的建军思想，建军路线，体现了林彪同志关于我军建设的一系列的极其重要的指示，是军委和总政治部对全军一九六七年工作提出的总方针、总任务、总要求。宣讲和学习元旦社论，使全军上下按照社论的精神，齐心协力去做，是今年政治思想工作的第一仗，对全面落实社论的要求，搞好全军工作，具有决定性的意义，这一仗一定要打好。许多领导干部都纷纷深入基层，向干部、战士、职工和家属宣讲社论。许多单位组织了宣传队，赶排文艺节目，通过黑板报、墙报、幻灯、有线广播，进行广泛深入的宣传，迅速使元旦社论精神家喻户晓，深入人心。
    广大干部战士通过学习讨论，进一步看清了当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了伟大胜利，资产阶级反动路线宣告破产，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子日益孤立。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同广大群众的革命热情相结合，出现了文化大革命的新高潮。伟大的毛泽东思想空前普及，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和那些牛鬼蛇神，陷落在革命群众的汪洋大海之中。指战员们说：毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的形势好得很。这个运动正以雷霆万钧之势，磅礴于全中国，震动了全世界。全军指战员表示，坚决贯彻和保卫毛主席的革命路线，更加深入地批判资产阶级反动路线，积极参加和保卫无产阶级文化大革命，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    广大干部战士用生动事例说明，过去的一年，全军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，贯彻执行林彪同志提出的突出政治的五项原则，在精神和物质两条战线上都取得了伟大胜利。在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动一浪高过一浪，大学大用“老三篇”，在破私立公、改造世界观上，取得了很大的成绩。广大干部战士愈来愈深刻地体会到，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是我们心中的红太阳，是全党全国一切工作的指导方针，是我们建军的核心、建军的灵魂、建军的根本。大家表示，一定要进一步激发和增强对毛主席和毛泽东思想的阶级感情，把对活学活用毛主席著作的认识提到一个新的高度。活学活用毛主席著作一定要进一步抓紧，更加讲究落实，加倍努力，学出新的水平，用出新的水平。
    广大干部战士学习了社论进一步认识到，把我军办成毛泽东思想大学校的核心问题，是贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对资产阶级反动路线，用毛泽东思想改造人的灵魂，促进人的思想革命化。离开了毛主席的正确路线，就一定会走到邪路上去。大家表示，一定把“老三篇”和古田会议决议当成座右铭来学，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想。某部学习毛主席著作积极分子、副连长郭小四说：“把古田会议决议当作座右铭来学，这在当前批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，具有极其重要的现实意义。毛主席的这篇光辉著作是我党的建党纲领，我军的建军纲领，是清除资产阶级反动路线的铁扫帚，也是清除我们灵魂深处污泥浊水的铁扫帚。在把我军办成毛泽东思想大学校的道路上，一步也不能离开它。”“航空兵英雄中队”的飞行员在讨论中说，我们要大学大用“老三篇”，在灵魂深处进行“手术”，切除“私”字的病根，换上一颗“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的红心，装上一副无产阶级的钢筋铁骨，向共产主义的精神世界进军，做共产主义的新人。
    许多领导同志认为，要把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，关键是自己带头学好，带头用好。某团领导干部说，社论指出领导干部到战士中去，到群众中去，同战士一起学，一起用，同群众一起学，一起用，是十分重要的。他们以自己的切身体会说明，到群众中去改造思想，有很多好处：可以让群众更好地监督和帮助自己；可以更好地向群众学习，克服自己的局限性和盲目性；领导干部在思想改造上做出好样子，在贯彻和保卫毛主席的革命路线上做出好样子，就能更好地影响和推动部队的革命化建设。某部教导员尹玉录说：“我们一定要把‘老三篇’和古田会议决议当成座右铭来学，在改造世界观的过程中，学在前，亮在前，斗在前，改在前，做思想革命化的带头人。”
    各级领导机关和连队学习社论以后，进一步认识到，创造四好连队运动，是贯彻一九六○年军委扩大会议决议，加强连队建设的根本措施。许多部队党委要求领导干部深入实际，狠抓基层，突出政治，大抓狠抓活思想，用毛泽东思想回答和解决各种现实思想问题，创造更多更好的四好连队。许多连队党支部，根据元旦社论的要求，进一步修订了创造四好连队的计划，决心把好突出政治的关，进一步加强对活学活用毛主席著作的领导。用毛泽东思想培养共产主义新人，通过四好运动的持续开展和不断提高，把连队办成毛泽东思想的好学校。
    广大干部战士表示，一定要按照毛主席的教导，当好战斗队、工作队、生产队，把军学、军农、军工、军民都兼起来；一定要按照毛主席关于“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志”的教导，百倍提高警惕，加强战备，坚守战斗岗位，随时准备粉碎美帝国主义及其帮凶的突然袭击，随时准备和越南人民并肩作战，消灭万恶的美国侵略者，为解放台湾，保卫祖国，支援世界人民革命而奋斗。
