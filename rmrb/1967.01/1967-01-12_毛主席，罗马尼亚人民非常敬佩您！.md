Chairman Mao, the Romanian people hold you in high esteem!

Recently, the Chinese men's and women's table tennis teams, upon invitation, visited Romania for more than ten days, receiving enthusiastic hospitality and welcome from the Romanian people. The Romanian people, in various forms, expressed their admiration and love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, to the Chinese athletes.

Everywhere the Chinese athletes went, many people, with hearts full of reverence for Chairman Mao, came to request Mao's portraits, Mao badges, and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Upon receiving a shiny Mao badge, they treasured it as a precious gem, carefully pinning it to their chests. Two drivers and one athlete, after obtaining Mao's portrait, said they would definitely frame it and hang it on the wall. A young man, after receiving an English version of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," jumped for joy, repeatedly saying, "Thank you, thank you!"

During their visit to Romania, the Chinese athletes were deeply moved by the Romanian people's love for Chairman Mao. Often, people wanted to talk with the Chinese athletes, but due to language barriers, they would pat their chests and say, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" to express their love for Chairman Mao. An agricultural research official told Chinese friends that Mao Zedong Thought is very correct. The development of the world situation has not surpassed Chairman Mao's foresight. He also said, "I know who the true Marxist-Leninists are. History has proven that Comrade Mao Zedong is truly great. We hold Comrade Mao Zedong in high esteem."

A driver said, "We Romanian people love Comrade Mao Zedong very much."

A sports worker said, "The Communist Party of China is holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, while the Soviet Union has changed colors."

A soldier said, "We broad masses of soldiers support China's policies. Chairman Mao Zedong is a true Marxist-Leninist."

The Romanian people also praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. A laboratory worker said, "What China is doing today in the Cultural Revolution is what the whole world will do in the future."

    毛主席，罗马尼亚人民非常敬佩您！
    中国青年男、女乒乓球队最近应邀到罗马尼亚进行了十多天的友好访问，受到了罗马尼亚人民的热情接待和欢迎。罗马尼亚人民以各种形式，向中国运动员表达了他们对中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的敬仰和热爱。
    中国运动员每到一个地方，总有很多人怀着对毛主席的崇敬的心情，前来索要毛主席像、毛主席像章和《毛主席语录》。当他们得到一枚金光闪闪的毛主席像章之后，如获至宝，小心地把它别在胸前。有两位司机和一位运动员得到了毛主席像之后都说一定要把毛主席像镶在镜框里挂在墙上。一位青年得到了一本英文版的《毛主席语录》后，高兴的跳了起来，连声说：“谢谢，谢谢！”
    中国运动员在罗马尼亚访问期间，深深被罗马尼亚人民热爱毛主席的心情所感动。经常有些人想和我国运动员交谈，但由于语言不通，他们就拍着自己的心口说：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”来表达自己对毛主席的热爱。有一位搞农业科学研究的干部对中国朋友说，毛泽东思想是非常正确的。世界大局的发展都没有超越毛泽东主席的预见。他还说，我懂得谁是真正的马克思列宁主义者。历史证明，毛泽东同志是非常伟大的。我们非常敬佩毛泽东同志。
    一位汽车司机说：“我们罗马尼亚人民非常热爱毛泽东同志”。
    一位体育工作者说：“中国共产党高举马克思列宁主义的大旗，而苏联已变颜色了。”
    一位战士说：“我们广大的士兵支持中国的政策。毛泽东同志是真正的马克思列宁主义者。”
    罗马尼亚人民还纷纷赞扬由毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命。一位实验员说：“中国今天在文化大革命中所作的一切，都是全世界将来要作的。”
