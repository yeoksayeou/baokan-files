Time flies so quickly. Before we know it, the New Year is here again. Looking at the situation in our country, it gets better every day and every year, and I am truly happy.

In 1966, our country had countless good things. Among all the good things, the best is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally led and initiated by Chairman Mao. We poor and lower-middle peasants strongly support this great revolution. We are the most enthusiastic and fervent in responding to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. We must definitely care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

During the Cultural Revolution, we poor and lower-middle peasants enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Lin Biao to study the "Three Articles" extensively and use them extensively. We treat the "Three Articles" as the best weapon to thoroughly criticize and repudiate selfishness and thoroughly establish public spirit. We sharpen our minds, fostering a new spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death, dedicating ourselves to the people, and doing everything for the revolution. Now, there are more and more people who are devoted to the public good, and more and more people who have mastered Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the masses know the truth and have a common goal, they will unite to do it." We have read Chairman Mao's books, and we have become wiser. We have a clear direction in our work, steady steps in our path, and more strength in our labor. Production is getting better and better. It is a double harvest of both ideology and production. In our place, the yield in 1966 compared to 1965 increased by more than ten percent for wheat, by one and a half times for rice, and by nearly ten percent for cotton.

We poor and lower-middle peasants see such a great situation and are overjoyed. We cheer for the great victory of the Cultural Revolution and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Our great leader Chairman Mao always stands the highest and sees the farthest. He not only sees the revolution in China but also the revolution in the whole world. The path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution guided by Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely follow. Those who stubbornly cling to the capitalist reactionary line and want to protect the power-holders who take the capitalist road, aiming to restore capitalism in the future, will never succeed! We must definitely root out this black root.

In the new year, I will, together with all the poor and lower-middle peasants and the Red Guards, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside, do a good job in agricultural production, make due contributions to the revolution and the people, and achieve new victories in both revolution and production.

    文化大革命形势越来越好  一心为公的人越来越多
    学习毛主席著作积极分子　顾阿桃
    辰光真快，一转眼，新年又到了。看看我们国家形势，一日好过一日，一年好过一年，心里实在高兴。
    一九六六年，我们国家的好事说不完。千好万好，还是毛主席亲自领导和发动的无产阶级文化大革命最好。我们贫下中农最拥护这场大革命，最积极、最热烈地响应党中央、毛主席的伟大号召，一定要关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在文化大革命中，我们贫下中农热烈响应党中央和林彪同志的号召，大学大用“老三篇”，把“老三篇”当作最好的武器，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，把头脑里的刀磨得亮亮的，磨出了一个一不怕苦，二不怕死，一心为人民，一切为革命的新思想。现在一心为公的人越来越多了，掌握毛泽东思想的人越来越多了。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做。”我们读了毛主席的书，人越来越聪明了，办起事来方向明，走起路来脚步稳，干起活来更有劲，生产搞得越来越好了。真是思想、生产双丰收。我们这里，一九六六年产量同一九六五年比较，三麦增产了一成多，水稻增产了一成半，棉花增产了近一成。
    我们贫下中农看到这样一派大好形势，心里乐得不得了，大家欢呼文化大革命的伟大胜利，欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席总是站得最高，看得最远，不光看到中国的革命，也看到全世界的革命。毛主席指引的无产阶级文化大革命这条路，我们贫下中农走定了，跟定了。那一小撮顽固地抱着资产阶级反动路线不放的黑心人，想保护走资本主义道路的当权派，好在将来搞资本主义复辟，那是万万办不到的！我们一定要把这个黑根揪出来。
    在新的一年里，我决心同全体贫下中农一道，同红卫兵小将们一道，搞好农村的无产阶级文化大革命，搞好农业生产，为革命、为人民做出应有的贡献，夺取革命和生产的新胜利。
