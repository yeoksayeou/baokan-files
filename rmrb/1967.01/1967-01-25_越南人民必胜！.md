The Vietnamese people will surely win!

The U.S. imperialists have committed new heinous crimes in both North and South Vietnam. The Chinese people strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' savage bombing of Vietnamese cities and villages in the North and the massacre of the South Vietnamese people, and express the most resolute support to the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting against the U.S. aggressors.

The Vietnamese people have already beaten the U.S. aggressors to a state of disarray and desperation. The war of aggression against Vietnam has become a noose that is tightening around the neck of U.S. imperialism. The Johnson administration has been choked by this noose to the point of gasping for breath, finding itself in a predicament of internal and external difficulties and in a state of utter disarray. In an attempt to salvage the failing war in Vietnam, it is playing the "peace talks" trick on one hand, and on the other, it is frantically expanding its aggression, hoping to use these counter-revolutionary tactics to shake the Vietnamese people's resolve to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation.

However, the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" plot cannot deceive the Vietnamese people, and their savage war crimes cannot intimidate the Vietnamese people. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "Imperialism and reactionaries are always seeking to harm others but end up harming themselves." The U.S. imperialists' desperate struggles will only further arouse the Vietnamese people's hatred towards the aggressors, hastening the day of their complete failure.

　　越南人民必胜！
    美帝国主义在越南北方和南方又犯下了新的滔天罪行。中国人民强烈谴责美帝国主义野蛮轰炸越南北方城乡和屠杀南越人民的暴行，并向英勇抗击美国侵略者的越南人民表示最坚决的支持。
    越南人民已把美国侵略者打得焦头烂额、走投无路。侵越战争成了套在美帝国主义脖子上的一根越拉越紧的绞索。约翰逊政府已经被这根绞索勒得喘不过气来，处于内外交困、狼狈不堪的境地。为了挽救侵越战争的败局，它一面玩弄“和谈”骗局，一面疯狂扩大侵略，妄想用反革命两手来动摇越南人民抗美救国的决心。
    但是，美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋欺骗不了越南人民，它的野蛮的战争罪行也吓不倒越南人民。正如毛主席所指出的，帝国主义和反动派“总是以损人开始，以害己告终”。美帝国主义的疯狂挣扎，只能更加激起越南人民对侵略者的仇恨，使它彻底失败的日子加快到来。
