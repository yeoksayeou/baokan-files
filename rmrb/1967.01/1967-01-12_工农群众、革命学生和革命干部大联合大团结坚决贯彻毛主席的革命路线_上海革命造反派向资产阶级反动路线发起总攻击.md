Shanghai's revolutionary rebels launch a full-scale attack on the bourgeois reactionary line

At present, a small clique within the Shanghai Party that is taking the capitalist road and stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line is facing the prospect of total collapse, but they are still struggling desperately. The revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses are full of fighting spirit, pursuing relentlessly, and vowing to achieve double victories in the Cultural Revolution and production. They will not stop until they achieve complete victory!

New China News Agency, Shanghai, January 11th - On January 8th, Shanghai's "Wen Hui Daily" and "Liberation Daily" simultaneously published a reporter's commentary titled "Shanghai's Revolutionary Rebels Launch a Full-Scale Attack on the Bourgeois Reactionary Line," commenting on the current excellent situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai.

The reporter's commentary pointed out: Under the correct guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai has achieved tremendous victories. The flames are roaring, and the victory songs are resounding. The revolutionary situation is excellent and getting better and better! The unprecedentedly united and strengthened revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses, together, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, promoting revolution and production, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, and launching a full-scale attack on the small clique within the Shanghai Party that is taking the capitalist road and stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. The small clique within the Shanghai Party that is taking the capitalist road and stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line is facing the prospect of total collapse. They are now using more covert and vicious methods to struggle desperately. The cultural revolution in Shanghai has begun to enter a deeper and broader new stage.

The first important sign that the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai is excellent is: the broad masses of workers and peasants have risen up in rebellion. They have broken through various obstacles, established their own revolutionary organizations, liberated themselves, and risen up in revolution. The million industrial workers with a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition have formed a vast cultural revolutionary army, with the momentum of overturning mountains and the force of thunder, breaking through all obstacles and pushing the cultural revolution in industrial and mining enterprises to surge forward. The revolutionary rebels in industrial and mining enterprises have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "rebellion is justified," fearing neither suppression nor pressure, overcoming numerous difficulties, and finally breaking through. They have always insisted on "grasp revolution, promote production." First, they saw through the plot of the small clique within the Shanghai Party that was adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line to suppress the revolution under the pretext of "promoting production" and gave them a heavy blow. Then, they exposed their vicious tactic of instigating and indulging the workers in their puppet organizations to leave their production posts and sabotage production, in an attempt to sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. Many factory revolutionary rebels, while carrying out exposure and struggle, firmly guarded their production posts and thoroughly smashed the new attacks of the small clique. Their revolutionary actions gradually gained the support of the broad masses, and many who were deceived woke up. The ranks of the revolutionary rebels grew stronger day by day, and their struggles achieved one victory after another.

The peasants in the suburbs are now also actively participating in the proletarian cultural revolution. Revolutionary organizations have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses are determined to thoroughly overthrow the small clique within the rural Party that is taking the capitalist road and thoroughly eliminate all capitalist and revisionist old things. Recently, many counties have held mass rallies of tens of thousands of people, launching fierce attacks on the small clique within the Party that is taking the capitalist road and stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, and igniting a surging wave of peasant movements.

The second important sign that the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai is excellent is: the revolutionary rebels in municipal Party and government organs have emerged, breaking through various frameworks such as "internal and external differences," and together with workers and revolutionary students, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and fighting against the small clique within the Party that is taking the capitalist road. Their revolutionary actions have had a great impact on the staff of Party and government organs at various levels in Shanghai. The revolutionary rebels in Shanghai's news units have taken over the "Liberation Daily" and "Wen Hui Daily." The propaganda tools controlled by the revolutionary rebels, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, have vigorously promoted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary rebels and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeois gentlemen, and have been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses.

The third important sign that the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai is excellent is: the revolutionary rebels not only have a growing and stronger force, but their fighting skills are also becoming more mature. They learn to swim while swimming and learn to fight while fighting. In the great winds and waves, in the arduous, complex, and tortuous class struggles, they have grown and tempered themselves. They always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle, dare to do, fear neither heaven nor earth, nor ghosts, nor death, and carry forward the spirit of Lu Xun's hard bones, advancing bravely. Whether it is the worker revolutionary rebels, the revolutionary rebels in schools and colleges, or the revolutionary rebels in organs, every red rebel team has a glorious history of revolutionary struggle that is worthy of praise and tears. The revolutionary rebels best understand that the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all our work is the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought. Great Mao Zedong Thought is the action guide for the proletarian cultural revolution. Therefore, they always insist on learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, learning in struggle and using in struggle. Especially after Comrade Lin Biao issued the great call to raise the mass movement of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, they have become more conscious of studying Chairman Mao's works, taking the "Three Articles" as their motto, breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," fighting more bravely and arduously, and launching fierce attacks on the bourgeois reactionary line and the small clique within the Party that is taking the capitalist road.

In the struggle, the broad revolutionary rebels not only become more united, but also pay attention to uniting the majority of the masses. Particularly worth mentioning is that many revolutionary youngsters in schools and colleges, following Chairman Mao's teachings, go to factories and rural areas to work and live, learn from the broad workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, participate in the proletarian cultural revolution, and promote Mao Zedong Thought, beginning to combine with workers and peasants. Many worker revolutionary rebels in factories also send representatives to schools to learn. In this way, they promote each other, exchange internally and externally, and further ignite the high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution. In more than a month, through several city-wide struggle and criticism meetings of the bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary rebels in factories, rural areas, schools, and organs have achieved great unity and solidarity, united under the same battle target, fought together, and won together. At the same time, through each struggle and each exposure and criticism meeting, and the extensive political and ideological work carried out by the revolutionary rebels, many deceived masses have seen through the true face of those who adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, and the masses who were hesitant and observing have further distinguished right from wrong and joined the side of the revolutionary rebels.

The fourth important sign that the proletarian cultural revolution in Shanghai is excellent is: the bourgeois reactionary line is beginning to collapse completely, and the ugly faces of the small clique within the Party that is taking the capitalist road under the protection of the bourgeois reactionary line have begun to be exposed in broad daylight. In the process of launching fierce attacks on the bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses have increasingly seen clearly that the small clique in Shanghai that stubbornly adheres to the bourgeois reactionary line includes some who are the Party's clique taking the capitalist road. This small clique, in the proletarian cultural revolution, has used various vicious methods to resist the Party Central Committee, resist Chairman Mao, and viciously attack the Central Cultural Revolution Group. They have one face in public and another in private, one face to the superiors and another to the subordinates. They have done everything possible to suppress the masses, viciously encircle and attack the revolutionary Red Guards, and soften and buy off the Red Guards. They have used despicable means to obstruct workers from rising up in rebellion, and when they failed, they organized a group of people to form puppet tools to "protect" them. They have used various forms to shelter counter-revolutionary revisionists; created incidents, instigated the masses to fight the masses, instigated workers to fight students, and themselves retreated to the background, "sitting on the mountain watching the tigers fight." A large number of facts show that they are not accidental in stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. Some of them have committed many crimes against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. They are holding on to the bourgeois reactionary line as a straw to "protect" themselves and "protect" their "official hats." However, the surging tide of the proletarian cultural revolution is unstoppable. In the face of the revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, any demon or ghost, no matter how cleverly they hide or how cunning their methods, will not escape the fate of being exposed.

"One should use the remaining courage to pursue the fleeing enemy and should not seek fame by imitating King Xiang Yu." The revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses in Shanghai deeply understand that although the current situation is good, the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line is deep and the poison is widespread, and the struggle will still have twists and turns. The arduous tasks facing the revolutionary rebels and the revolutionary masses are still very heavy. Therefore, they must abandon illusions, persist in struggle, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

    工农群众、革命学生和革命干部大联合大团结坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线
    上海革命造反派向资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击
    目前上海地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子面临全线崩溃的命运，但还在垂死挣扎。革命造反派和革命群众斗志旺盛，穷追猛打，誓夺文化大革命和生产双胜利，不获全胜，决不收兵！
    新华社上海十一日电　上海《文汇报》、《解放日报》八日同时发表了题为《上海革命造反派向资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击》的记者述评，评述上海地区当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势。
    记者述评指出：在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的正确指引下，上海地区的无产阶级文化大革命，取得了巨大的胜利。烈火熊熊，凯歌高奏，革命形势好得很，越来越好！空前团结壮大的革命造反派和广大革命群众一起，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，抓革命、促生产，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，向着上海地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，发起了总攻击。上海地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，正面临全线崩溃的命运，他们正在采取更隐蔽、更毒辣的手段进行垂死挣扎。上海地区的文化大革命，开始进入了一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。
    上海地区无产阶级文化大革命形势好得很的第一个重要标志是：广大的工人、农民起来造反了。他们冲破各种阻力，建立了自己的革命组织，自己解放自己，自己起来闹革命。具有光荣革命斗争传统的百万产业工人，组成了一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，冲破一切障碍，推动工矿企业的文化大革命汹涌澎湃地向前发展。工矿企业的革命造反派，坚决按照毛主席的“造反有理”的教导办事，不怕打击，不怕压制，克服了重重困难，终于杀出来了。他们始终坚持“抓革命，促生产”。先是识破了上海地区党内一小撮坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的人借口“抓生产”来压制革命的阴谋，并且给予狠狠的打击；继而又戳穿了他们唆使、纵容御用组织中被蒙蔽的工人群众擅自离开生产岗位，破坏生产，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命的恶毒手法。许多工厂的革命造反派一面进行揭发斗争，一面坚守生产岗位，彻底粉碎了一小撮人的新的进攻。他们的革命行动，逐步得到了广大群众的支持，不少受蒙蔽的人纷纷觉醒过来，革命造反派的队伍一天比一天发展壮大，他们的斗争取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。
    郊区的农民现在也积极投入了无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，革命的组织像雨后春笋般地建立起来了。广大贫下中农和革命群众决心彻底斗垮农村中党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底铲除一切资本主义和修正主义的旧东西。最近，不少县召开了几万人的大会，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，发起猛烈的攻击，掀起了轰轰烈烈的农民运动的热潮。
    上海地区无产阶级文化大革命形势好得很的第二个重要标志是：市级党政机关的革命造反派杀出来了，他们打破了“内外有别”等种种框框，同工人、革命学生一起批判资产阶级反动路线，斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们的革命行动，给上海地区各级党政机关的工作人员以很大的影响。上海新闻单位的革命造反派，接管了《解放日报》和《文汇报》。革命造反派掌握的宣传工具，以最大的革命热情，大力宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大长了革命造反派的志气，大灭了资产阶级老爷们的威风，受到广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    上海地区无产阶级文化大革命形势好得很的第三个重要标志是：革命造反派不仅队伍越来越壮大，而且斗争艺术也越来越趋于成熟。他们在游泳中学习游泳，在斗争中学习斗争，在大风大浪中，在艰苦、复杂、曲折的阶级斗争中锻炼成长起来。他们始终高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，敢字当头，天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，死不怕，发扬鲁迅的硬骨头精神，勇往直前。无论是工人革命造反派，大中学校的革命造反派，还是机关的革命造反派，每一支红色造反队伍都有着一页可歌可泣的革命斗争的光荣历史。革命造反派最懂得，我们一切工作取得胜利的根本保证是战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想。伟大的毛泽东思想是无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南。因此，他们始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。特别是林彪同志发出了把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段的伟大号召以后，他们更加自觉地学习毛主席著作，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，更勇敢地艰苦奋斗，向资产阶级反动路线和一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。
　  在斗争中，广大革命造反派不仅越来越团结一致，而且也注意团结群众的大多数。尤其可喜的是，许多大中学校的革命小将，遵循毛主席的教导，到工厂和农村去劳动与生活，向广大工人和贫下中农学习，参加无产阶级文化大革命，宣传毛泽东思想，开始和工农相结合。不少工厂的工人革命造反派也派出代表，到学校取经。这样，相互推动，内外交流，进一步掀起了无产阶级文化大革命的高潮。近一个多月来，通过几次全市性的斗争和批判资产阶级反动路线的大会，工厂、农村、学校和机关的革命造反派实行了大联合、大团结，在同一个战斗目标下，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。同时，通过每一次斗争，每一次揭发批判大会，加上革命造反派进行了广泛的政治思想工作，使许多受蒙蔽的群众认清了坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的人的真面目，使犹疑观望的群众进一步明辨了是非，倒向革命造反派一边。
    上海地区无产阶级文化大革命形势好得很的第四个重要标志是：资产阶级反动路线开始全线崩溃，在资产阶级反动路线庇护下的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的丑恶面目，已开始暴露在光天化日之下。革命造反派和广大革命群众在向资产阶级反动路线猛烈进攻的过程中，越来越明显地看清，上海地区一小撮顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，有的就是党内走资本主义道路的当权派。这一小撮人在无产阶级文化大革命中，采用种种恶劣手法，对抗党中央，对抗毛主席，恶毒地攻击中央文化革命小组。他们明里一套，暗中一套，对上一套，对下一套。他们千方百计地压制群众，阴险毒辣地围攻、打击革命的红卫兵小将，软化收买红卫兵小将。他们用卑劣的手段阻挠工人起来革命造反，阻挠不成，就指使一批人组织御用工具为其“保驾”。他们采用各种形式，包庇反革命修正主义分子；制造事件，挑动群众斗群众，挑动工人斗学生，自己则退居幕后，“坐山观虎斗”。大量的事实表明，他们如此顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线，并不是偶然的，其中有的人自己就犯下了许多反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行。他们死死地抱住资产阶级反动路线这根稻草，就是为了“保”自己，“保”自己的“乌纱帽”。但是，无产阶级文化大革命的滚滚洪流是不可阻挡的，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派和广大革命群众面前，任何妖魔鬼怪，不管他隐蔽得多么巧妙，不管他采用多么狡猾的手法，都逃不脱被揪出来的命运。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”上海的革命造反派和广大革命群众深深懂得，尽管当前的形势很好，但资产阶级反动路线影响很深，流毒很广，斗争还会有曲折和反复，摆在革命造反派和革命群众面前的任务还很艰巨。因此，必须丢掉幻想，坚持斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
