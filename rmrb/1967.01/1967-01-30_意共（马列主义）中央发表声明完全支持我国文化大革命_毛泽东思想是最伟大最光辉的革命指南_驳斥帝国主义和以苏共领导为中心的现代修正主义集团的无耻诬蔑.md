The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninist) has issued a statement expressing its full support for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The statement praises Mao Zedong Thought as the greatest and most brilliant revolutionary guide.

The statement, titled "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—The Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninist) Stands on the Side of Comrades in China Who Are Carrying Out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," was published in the latest issue of the weekly "Nuovo Impegno."

The statement says that China is carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and successfully building socialism, training a new generation as reliable successors to the revolutionary cause.

The statement strongly refutes the slanders by imperialists and the modern revisionist group centered around the Soviet Communist Party against China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong Thought. It points out, "Being attacked by class enemies means taking the most correct revolutionary stance. Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and most brilliant revolutionary guide and the highest creative achievement of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

The statement says: Imperialists and revisionists "hoped that China would also see a Khrushchev-like situation, but under the firm and wise leadership of Mao Zedong, the Communist Party of China has strongly responded, ... launched the Red Guard movement, and promoted the brilliant Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

The statement concludes: The Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninist) is determined to fully support China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In this decisive historical test, it stands on the side of Chinese comrades. This Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, is of fundamental significance not only to the Chinese people but also to the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries.

The Communist Party of Italy (Marxist-Leninist) "fully recognizes its proletarian internationalist obligations and has mobilized to stand on the side of the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong. The Communist Party of China is the most advanced fighting force in the world socialist revolution."
