Burmese friends are enthusiastically cheering the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and Shanxi. They praise the workers, peasants, and other laborers for raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieving brilliant victories in the struggle against the capitalist roaders' counter-revolutionary line.

A Burmese cultural worker wrote in an article full of revolutionary fervor on January 27, "The seas churn with waves of anger, the continents shake with thunderous roars. We must sweep away all harmful pests, leaving none behind." He then pointed out that the people of the world are cheering the new, great, and decisive high tide of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "Let us beat the drums and blow the horns to welcome the revolutionary rebels of China—the workers, peasants, and other laborers—who are surging forward like a storm to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

He said, "We wholeheartedly and resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and Shanxi—the workers, peasants, and other laborers—who have seized power from those in authority who are taking the capitalist road. We, like all revolutionary people of the world, are greatly inspired by this revolutionary action."

He said, "We are fully convinced that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese proletarian rebels, together with the broad masses of Chinese revolutionaries, will surely break through all obstacles set up by the bourgeois elements and achieve brilliant victories in making revolution. This revolution will make China forever red and plant the red flag all over the world."

A group of Burmese workers wrote a letter to their Chinese friends saying, "At present, the proletarian revolutionary rebel organizations in China are responding to Chairman Mao's call, shouting, 'The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will?' They are launching a fierce attack on the handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The proletariat and the broad masses of laborers in Shanghai and Shanxi have seized the reins of power and become masters of their own fate. This is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This is something worth emulating, learning from, and being proud of for us and all oppressed people of the world."

They shouted, "Long live the red sun in the hearts of the world's proletariat, Chairman Mao!"

A Burmese friend, in a conversation with a Xinhua News Agency reporter, enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally led by the beloved leader of the world's revolutionary people, the great helmsman Chairman Mao. He said, "The victory of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary rebels in seizing power is not only a great victory for the Chinese people but also a great victory for all revolutionary people of the world. This is also a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." This Burmese friend expressed his heartfelt support for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and paid tribute to all revolutionary rebel organizations in China.

He concluded, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Mao Zedong Thought!"

    一位缅甸文艺工作者二十七日在他所写的一篇充满革命激情的文章中首先引用毛主席的词：“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”然后指出，世界革命人民欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命出现新的、伟大的、决定性的高潮，让我们敲锣打鼓，吹响号角来欢迎中国的革命造反工人、农民和其他劳动人民，他们正以排山倒海之势胜利地投入无产阶级文化大革命中。
    他说：“我们由衷地坚决支持上海和山西的革命造反工人、农民和其他劳动人民的革命造反行动，他们夺了那些走资本主义道路当权派的权。我们，象全世界革命人民一样受到这一革命造反行动的巨大鼓舞。”
    他说：“我们完全相信，中国的无产阶级造反派在毛泽东思想的指导下和在毛主席的亲自领导下，同中国的广大革命群众联合起来，一定会冲破资产阶级分子设置的种种障碍，取得闹革命的光辉胜利。这场革命将使中国永远通红，并且把红旗插遍全世界。”
    一批缅甸工人联名写信给中国朋友说：“目前，中国的无产阶级革命造反派组织响应毛主席的号召，喊出‘天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？’向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。上海和山西的无产阶级和广大劳动人民夺回印把子，自己作了主人。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这是值得我们和全世界被压迫人民效法、学习和引以自豪的事情。”
    他们高呼：“世界无产阶级心中的红太阳毛主席万岁！”
