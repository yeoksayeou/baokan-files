The leader of the Albanian-China Friendship Association delegation, Comrade P. Dode, recently returned from a visit to China, spoke to a reporter from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana. He said that the Chinese Cultural Revolution has achieved brilliant victories. The Chinese people have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, which has demonstrated immense power.

Dode emphasized that the Cultural Revolution is aimed at blocking the road to revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, enabling the Chinese people to fulfill their historical mission more powerfully under current conditions. It is also aimed at consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat and opposing a handful of bourgeois revisionists. This handful of bourgeois revisionists want to change the color of China. He said that the Cultural Revolution has further promoted the revolutionary spirit of the masses, making them more loyal to the Party and Chairman Mao.

Dode said that during the delegation's visit to China, they had the opportunity to meet Comrade Mao Zedong and see for themselves that Chairman Mao is in good health, which was their greatest joy.

Dode said that during their visits to various places in China, they had the opportunity to meet with Chinese Red Guards everywhere. They saw with their own eyes that the Red Guards are revolutionary, full of vigor, and enthusiastic young people. They are loyal to the Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely oppose imperialism and modern revisionism, and firmly support Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. As the Chinese Red Guards have said, imperialism's attempt to change the color of China is doomed to failure.

Dode said that during their visit, they saw with their own eyes that the Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, have a high degree of revolutionary spirit and resolutely oppose imperialism and modern revisionism. The Chinese people have shown a high level of political awareness and great enthusiasm in their work. They have achieved brilliant successes in the fields of economy and science and technology. These achievements have made imperialism and modern revisionism tremble with fear.

He said, "China is indestructible. Imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionaries, and all anti-China enemies will surely meet with failure."

    阿中友协代表团团长赞扬红卫兵小将忠于毛主席忠于党
    帝国主义妄想中国变色，办不到！
    据新华社地拉那十日电　最近访问中国归来的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、科尔察区人民会议执行委员会主席、阿尔巴尼亚中国友好协会代表团团长彼·多德，在这里向新华社记者说，中国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了辉煌的胜利。毛泽东思想为中国劳动人民所掌握，显示了无比巨大的威力。
    多德强调指出，中国文化大革命是为了堵塞产生修正主义和资本主义复辟的道路，使中国人民更有力量在现今条件下完成它的历史使命；是为了巩固和加强无产阶级专政，反对一小撮资产阶级修正主义分子。这一小撮资产阶级修正主义分子妄想使中国改变颜色。他说，中国文化大革命进一步地发扬了群众的革命精神，使他们更加忠于党，忠于毛主席。
    多德说，代表团在中国访问时，能有机会见到毛泽东同志，亲眼看到毛主席身体很健康，这是我们最大的愉快。
    多德说，我们在中国各地参观访问时，到处和中国红卫兵举行会见，亲眼看到他们是革命的、生气勃勃的、热情的青年。他们忠于党，忠于毛主席，坚决反对帝国主义和现代修正主义，坚决拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。正如中国红卫兵所说的，帝国主义妄想中国变色，这是办不到的。
    多德说，我们在访问过程中，亲眼看到中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，具有高度的革命精神，坚决反对帝国主义和现代修正主义。中国人民在劳动中表现了高度的政治觉悟、巨大的热情。他们在经济和科学技术方面取得了辉煌的成就。这些成就使帝国主义和现代修正主义害怕。
    他说，中国是不可摧毁的。帝国主义、现代修正主义、反动派和一切反华敌人必将遭到失败。
