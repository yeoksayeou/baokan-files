The weekly "People's Voice" of the Belgian Communist Party published an editorial stating that the Belgian Communist Party "fully supports the great Chinese people's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Mao Zedong as its chief."

The editorial says: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has made the U.S. imperialists and their allies—the revisionists who have usurped power in the Soviet Union—have a hard time."

The editorial condemns the large-scale anti-China propaganda by the imperialists and revisionists. The editorial says: "The revisionists centered in Moscow play a leading role in this chorus. The TASS and the Yugoslavian news agency of Tito's followers are the main sources of news for the most reactionary newspapers and radio stations."

The editorial says: "The international reactionaries, like the Khrushchev revisionists, hope that the counter-revolutionary line serving the restoration of capitalism will prevail in China.

"However, this hope has been dashed. The Chinese people, through the organs of proletarian dictatorship and through new organizations initiated by the masses and in line with the needs of the struggle, are waging revolutionary battles.

"This irresistible wave has made the imperialists and their revisionist allies tremble. They howl, curse, jump up and down, and spread lies. But lies cannot save them from defeat."

The editorial says: "Unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm has swept across the entire country," "We support the great revolutionary people of China."

    比共机关报《人民之声》周刊发表社论指出
    中国文化大革命使美帝苏修怕得要死
    新华社布鲁塞尔十四日电　比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊十三日发表社论说，比利时共产党人“完全支持伟大的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下进行的中国无产阶级文化大革命。”
    社论说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命使美帝国主义及其同盟者——在苏联篡夺政权的修正主义者日子不好过。”
    社论谴责帝国主义者和修正主义者的大规模反华宣传。社论说：“以莫斯科为中心的修正主义者在这一合唱中居显要地位。塔斯社和铁托分子的南斯拉夫通讯社，是最反动的报刊和电台的主要消息来源。”
    社论说：“国际反动派跟赫鲁晓夫修正主义者一样，希望为资本主义复辟服务的反革命路线在中国得逞。
    “但是这种希望已经破灭。中国人民通过无产阶级专政机构，以及通过群众倡议的、符合斗争需要的新组织，来进行革命战斗。
    “这一势不可当的巨浪，使帝国主义者及其修正主义盟友发抖。他们嚎叫起来，咒骂起来，暴跳起来，大肆造谣撒谎。但是，谎言并不能使他们免遭失败。”
    社论说：“空前的革命热情席卷了整个中国”，“我们支持伟大的中国革命人民。”
