To break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and to achieve ideological revolutionization, we must fiercely combat selfish thoughts and cultivate a selfless proletarian ideology. We must set up the battlefield in the depths of our souls and engage in a great struggle between public and private interests.

In breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, there are often two attitudes. One is to talk about breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, but not daring to touch the depths of one's soul, not daring to break with the self. Such people are like timid generals who, as soon as they set foot on the battlefield and hear the sound of guns, retreat and dare not engage in combat. The other attitude is to dare to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to sweep away non-proletarian thoughts, to dare to break with selfishness, to stir up the self in the depths of one's thoughts, to dare to engage in close combat with selfishness, to fight to the death, to pursue and attack relentlessly, to plant the red flag of public-mindedness in the depths of the soul, and to uproot selfishness.

Two attitudes, two tactics, two results. The first attitude is characterized by fear, always passive. Therefore, it cannot break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness. On the contrary, selfish thoughts will become heavier, the old ideological positions will become larger, and may even occupy the entire soul. In this way, it is difficult to achieve ideological revolutionization. The second attitude, the second tactic, is characterized by daring, taking the initiative to attack, breaking with selfishness without fear of pain or shame, not allowing any room for selfishness in the mind. Such people dare to engage in close combat with selfishness, pursue and attack relentlessly, and are brave and tenacious in their struggle against selfishness. Therefore, selfishness is broken quickly, the battle results are significant, and ideological progress is rapid. This promotes the establishment of public-mindedness, making it firm and reliable, which is the correct strategy and tactics for achieving ideological revolutionization.

To break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, one must set up the battlefield in the depths of the soul and engage in close combat with selfish thoughts. Even a fleeting selfish thought must not be overlooked and must be pursued and attacked relentlessly until it is completely eliminated.

The more fiercely we fight the battle of breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness in the depths of our souls, the more we can make rapid progress on the revolutionary path.

The more deeply we fight the battle of breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness in the depths of our souls, allowing public-mindedness to fill every cell of our souls, the more we can firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought throughout our souls.

    灵魂深处摆战场
    王万旗
    我们要破私立公，实现思想革命化，就得狠斗私心杂念，大树一心为公的无产阶级思想，就得在我们的灵魂深处摆战场，展开一场公与私的大搏斗。
    破私立公，往往有两种态度。一种是口头上讲破私立公，但是，不敢触及自己的灵魂深处，不敢和私字决裂。这种人像胆小的将军一样，刚刚摆上战场，一听到枪响就向后退兵，就不敢再交锋了。另一种态度是敢于用毛泽东思想作武器，横扫非无产阶级思想，敢于破私立公，大闹自己思想深处的私字，敢于和私心短兵相接，刺刀见红，穷追猛打，让公字的红旗插在灵魂深处，把私字连根拔掉。
    两种态度，两种战法，两种效果。前一种态度处处是“怕”字当头，处于被动。因此就不能破私立公。相反，私心杂念会越来越重，旧思想的阵地会越来越大，甚至会占领整个灵魂。这样就很难实现思想革命化。后一种态度，后一种战法，则是“敢”字当头，主动攻击，破私心不怕痛，不怕丑，不让脑子里有私心存在的余地。这样的人做到了敢和私字拚刺刀，穷追猛打，对私心的斗争勇敢顽强。所以，“私”心破的快，战果大，思想进步快。这样就促使“公”字立的好、立的牢，这就是实现思想革命化的正确的战略战术。
    破私立公，必须在灵魂深处摆战场，必须要对准私心杂念拚刺刀，哪怕是一闪的私心杂念，也不能放过，也要穷追猛打，彻底消灭。
    灵魂深处破私立公的仗越打越顽强，我们才能在革命路上突飞猛进。
    灵魂深处破私立公的仗越打越向纵深进军，让公字充满我们灵魂的每一个细胞，才能使毛泽东思想在整个灵魂里牢固地树立起来。
