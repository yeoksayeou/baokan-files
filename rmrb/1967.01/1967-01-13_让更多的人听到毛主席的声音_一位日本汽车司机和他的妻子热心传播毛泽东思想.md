In Tokyo, there is a Japanese taxi driver and his wife who are both ardent listeners of Beijing's broadcasts to Japan and active promoters of Mao Zedong Thought. The couple always think: "We must let more people hear Chairman Mao's voice and spread the great Mao Zedong Thought to more people."

Every day from 6 PM, they sit by the radio, listening to Beijing's broadcasts until midnight. They listen while recording and meticulously take notes on the broadcast summaries, which they then distribute for free to friendly groups and individuals. For three years, they have been tirelessly spreading the great Mao Zedong Thought to the Japanese people.

However, starting from last May, the new and old followers of Soviet revisionism began to pressure them, attempting to force them to stop this noble work. They quickly saw through the revisionists' plot. They firmly believed in Chairman Mao's teachings: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support," and "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." They stood firm against this evil wind and did not yield. Last October, they resolutely cut off relations with those false friends who were sweet-talking but treacherous.

What force made this Japanese driver and his wife so steadfast? It is Mao Zedong Thought. Holding a bright red copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the Japanese driver said, "The enemy is spreading rumors to slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The more they do this, the more we feel it is our glorious duty to spread the voice of truth to the Japanese people." He said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He has brought Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. The world revolution will develop in the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao." He said, "Some people slander learning Mao Zedong Thought as 'subservience.' This precisely reflects their fear of Mao Zedong Thought. Anyone who wants revolution must study Mao Zedong Thought well."

The Japanese driver's family of four lives in a small room, facing many difficulties. Last summer, he was unjustly fired by his boss and only recently found a temporary job, working over 20 hours every other day. His wife works in a bakery and still has to take care of the children and manage the household when she gets home. Even under these difficult conditions, they never stop listening to Beijing's broadcasts and enthusiastically serve the Japanese people. His wife said, "To copy the tapes often requires working until late at night, sometimes until 2 or 3 AM. Sometimes I get so tired that I doze off, and the recording disc spins for half a day. But Chairman Mao's spirit of moving mountains inspires me. For the revolution, for the liberation of the Japanese people, I can overcome any hardship. Although it is tough now, I believe the dawn is just ahead."

### 让更多的人听到毛主席的声音  一位日本汽车司机和他的妻子热心传播毛泽东思想

    让更多的人听到毛主席的声音
    一位日本汽车司机和他的妻子热心传播毛泽东思想
    东京有一位日本汽车司机和他的妻子，都是北京对日广播的热心听众，同时他们又是毛泽东思想的积极传播者。两口子时刻想着：“要让更多的人听到毛主席的声音，向更多的人传播伟大的毛泽东思想”。
    每天从晚上六点钟开始，他们夫妻俩便坐在收音机旁，收听北京的广播，一直到十二点。他们边收听边录音，而且认真地记下广播提要，免费送给友好团体和个人。他们三年如一日地向日本人民传播着伟大的毛泽东思想。
    但是，从去年五月起，苏联修正主义的新旧追随者竟然向他们施加压力，企图迫使他们停止这项崇高的工作。他们很快地识破了修正主义分子的阴谋。他们坚信毛主席的教导：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”，“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。他们顶住了这股妖风，没有向他们屈服。去年十月，他们毅然地同那些口蜜腹剑的假朋友断绝了关系。
    是什么力量使这位日本司机和他的妻子这样坚强不屈呢？是毛泽东思想。这位日本司机手里捧着一本红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》说，敌人拚命地散布谣言诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命。越是这样，我们就更加感到能把真理的声音传播给日本人民，是我们的光荣义务。他说：毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段。世界革命将按照毛主席指出的方向发展。他说：“有人诬蔑学习毛泽东思想是什么‘事大主义’。这恰恰反映他们害怕毛泽东思想。凡是要革命的人，都应当很好地学习毛泽东思想。”
    这位日本司机一家四口人，挤在一间小屋里，生活很困难，前年夏天他被老板无故解雇，最近才找到一个临时工作，每隔一天要连续工作二十多小时。他的妻子在一家面包房劳动，回家来还要照顾孩子料理家务。就是在这样困难的条件下，他们也一天不间断地收听北京广播，热心地为日本人民服务。他的妻子说，为了复制录音带常常要工作到深夜两三点钟，有时太困了不觉打起盹来，录音盘就空转半天。但是，毛主席的愚公移山的精神鼓舞着我，为了革命，为了日本人民的解放，什么苦，我都能克服。现在虽然苦一些，我相信曙光就在前头。
