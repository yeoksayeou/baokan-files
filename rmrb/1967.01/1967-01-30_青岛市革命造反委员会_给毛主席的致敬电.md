	Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee's Telegram of Salutation to Chairman Mao

	New China News Agency, Jinan, January 29 - The Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee, formed by the joint efforts of 23 revolutionary rebel organizations in Qingdao, sent a telegram of salutation to our most beloved and respected great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, at its inaugural meeting on January 22. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To our most beloved Chairman Mao:

	We, the entire body of revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in Qingdao, who are forever loyal to you, pay our highest proletarian cultural revolutionary respects to you, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, the reddest sun in our hearts!

	With hearts full of immense joy and excitement, we report to you, dear Chairman, that today, 23 revolutionary rebel groups in Qingdao have united to seize the political, economic, and cultural powers from the hands of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the provincial and municipal committees and those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line! This is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! This is another great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, dear Chairman!

	Under the control and manipulation of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, capitalist-roaders within the party, and those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, the former Qingdao Municipal Committee has long been in violation of and resistance to your teachings, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the broad revolutionary masses. Since the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have openly defied central directives, brazenly resisted the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, dear Chairman, organized workers and peasants against students, suppressed the genuine revolutionary leftists, and orchestrated the horrifying and nationally shocking counter-revolutionary incidents of "August 25" and "September 1." They attempted to extinguish the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that you personally ignited, committing heinous crimes against the party and the people.

	The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. To bravely defend proletarian dictatorship, to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, and to defend you and the Party Central Committee headed by you to the death, today we have rebelled against the bourgeois masters of the Qingdao Municipal Committee and seized their power! We have established the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee, a proletarian dictatorship organ led by the working class and based on the great alliance of workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres. We have seized the political, economic, and cultural powers from the hands of the bourgeois masters and firmly grasped them in our own hands, passing them down from generation to generation to ensure that the proletarian heaven remains unchanging for eternity!

	In the future, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, read your books, listen to your words, and carry out your instructions without the slightest deviation. We will definitely and resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the bourgeois reactionary line. We will definitely and resolutely implement your correct policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," defeat counter-revolutionary economism, thoroughly smash the new counter-attacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieve new victories in both revolution and production!

	You have repeatedly instructed us that the enemy will not perish of its own accord and will not voluntarily exit the historical stage. After seizing power, we will definitely follow your instructions, "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame by imitating King Xiang Yu." We will definitely learn from the spirit of Lu Xun, the pioneer of the cultural revolution, to beat the fallen dogs, and thoroughly defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders within the municipal committee and those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, who are still obstinate and unrepentant. We will make sure they never rise again! We will definitely not disappoint your expectations, unite all revolutionary comrades under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao deeply, thoroughly, and completely, ensuring that the cultural revolution in Qingdao advances victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you!

	Let every corner of Qingdao forever shine with the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought!

	Let the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the skies of Qingdao!

	We wish you, the reddest sun in our hearts, eternal life! Eternal life!

	Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee
	January 22, 1967

　　青岛市革命造反委员会
　　给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社济南二十九日电　由青岛市二十三个革命造反组织联合而成的青岛市革命造反委员会在一月二十二日成立大会上，给最最敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席发了致敬电。致敬电全文如下：最最敬爱的毛主席：
    我们——永远忠于您的青岛市无产阶级革命造反派全体战士，向您，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，致以最最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，我们怀着万分喜悦与激动的心情，向您老人家报喜：今天我们青岛市二十三个革命造反团体联合起来，把青岛市的政治、经济和文化大权，从省、市委内一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的分子手中统统夺过来了！这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！这是以您老人家为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，前青岛市委在一小撮反革命修正主义分子、党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的分子的操纵把持下，长期以来，违背、抵制您的教导，对广大革命群众执行了资产阶级专政。无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们又公开对抗中央指示，肆意抵制以您老人家为代表的无产阶级革命路线，组织工农反学生，打击真正的革命左派，一手制造了骇人听闻、震惊全国的“八·二五”、“九·一”反革命事件，妄图把您亲手点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火扑灭，他们对党、对人民犯下了滔天罪行。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。为了勇敢捍卫无产阶级专政，为了捍卫以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线，为了誓死保卫您和以您为首的党中央，今天，我们造了青岛市委资产阶级老爷的反，夺了他们的权！我们成立了以工人阶级为领导，以工农、革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部为基础的大联合的无产阶级专政机构——青岛市革命造反委员会。我们把政治、经济、文化大权，从资产阶级老爷们的手中夺回来，紧紧掌握在自己的手里，让它一代一代传下去，确保无产阶级的江山千秋万代永不变色！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，今后，我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，读您的书，听您的话，不折不扣地照您的指示办事，永远做您的好学生、好战士。我们一定坚决贯彻执行以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线，把资产阶级反动路线彻底批倒、批臭、批垮。我们一定要坚决贯彻执行您提出的“抓革命，促生产”的正确方针，打倒反革命经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，夺取革命和生产的新的双胜利！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，您曾谆谆教导我们，敌人决不会自行消灭，他们也决不会自动退出历史舞台。夺取政权后，我们一定遵循您的教导，“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。我们一定学习文化革命的先驱鲁迅先生痛打“落水狗”的精神，把市委内一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线，至今仍然执迷不悟，死不回头的家伙，打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，使他们永世不得翻身！我们一定不辜负您老人家的期望，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，把一切革命的同志团结起来，把青岛市的无产阶级文化大革命搞深、搞透、搞彻底，使青岛市的文化大革命沿着以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进！
    让青岛市每一个角落都永远闪耀着光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉！
    让战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在青岛市的上空高高飘扬！永远飘扬！
    敬祝您老人家，我们心中最红最红的红太阳万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                                青岛市革命造反委员会
                                      一九六七年一月二十二日
