Recently, Comrade Lin Biao pointed out that the entire Party and the nation are currently engaged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The study of Chairman Mao's works has entered a new phase and created a new situation. Recently, Comrade Lin Biao further instructed that every comrade should study Chairman Mao's works diligently and earnestly, and that a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works should be initiated nationwide. This is a new call to arms for the entire Party, the army, and the people of the nation.

The essence of this call is to combine the study of Chairman Mao's works with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The new phase and situation that Comrade Lin Biao mentioned refer to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolutionary movement that advances with the triumphant songs of Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, against the bourgeois reactionary line, and against various bourgeois reactionary ideologies, the broad masses have felt more keenly the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, have felt a more urgent need for Mao Zedong Thought, and have developed an even deeper love for Mao Zedong Thought. The strong emotions within the masses for studying Chairman Mao's works have been further unleashed.

The basic spirit of Comrade Lin Biao's "study and apply" is to combine theory with practice. What is the current practice? It is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that has shocked the world. The study of Chairman Mao's works must be closely linked with this practice. This is the decisive key to initiating a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and it is also the guarantee for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the first step in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is to respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, to care about state affairs, and to dare to throw oneself into the whirlpool of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. "Apply" means to criticize, to struggle, to revolutionize, and to dare to rebel against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and to smash the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line. Those who walk the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the reactionary line, in order to confuse class lines and deceive the masses, mix in with the revolutionary masses and raise the banner of "criticizing" the bourgeois reactionary line. Only by truly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works can one see through the surface to grasp the essence and recognize their true faces; only then can one act without hesitation or wavering, and resolutely struggle against them.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one must be good at studying the skills to struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line. "Apply" means to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the movement and to defeat the enemy. Chairman Mao said: "What are the characteristics of the current movement? What are its laws? How to guide this movement? These are practical problems." "In the development of the movement, there are new things ahead, and new things are endless. Studying the overall development of this movement is a major topic that we must always pay attention to." These words were spoken by Chairman Mao during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and today, re-reading these teachings is especially heartwarming.

In the movement, various classes and social political forces will stubbornly express themselves. Various ideologies, various contradictions, various problems, and various opinions will all come to the surface, forcing people to think, to analyze, to criticize, and to solve problems. We must heighten our political sensitivity, grasp the pulse of class struggle, and be good at timely discovering new contradictions, new problems, and active thoughts that emerge in the movement; according to Mao Zedong Thought, analyze the relationships between various classes and political forces, study their political trends, master and use correct strategies and tactics, rely on the revolutionary leftists, win over and unite the majority, and achieve one victory after another.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, one must use Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's worldview. The class struggle storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has raised many major political issues for people, forcing people to express their likes and dislikes and to decide on their choices, thus touching the deepest parts of people's souls. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a mirror to examine ourselves and promote our own ideological revolutionization. Once we discover that we have made mistakes or taken the wrong stand, we must definitely be brave enough to admit and correct our mistakes, rather than covering up our faults and avoiding our illnesses.

In some places, the responsible comrades deliberately oppose the study of Chairman Mao's works to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They hold study sessions of Chairman Mao's works with thousands or tens of thousands of people, but they do not allow the connection to the Cultural Revolution. On the contrary, they strike down those who insist on connecting the study of Chairman Mao's works to the Cultural Revolution.

Some responsible comrades deliberately use the masses' initiative in self-revolution to create a situation where everyone has to pass inspection, inciting the masses to fight against the masses, diverting the direction of the struggle, and letting a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party escape.

Is this called leading the masses to study Chairman Mao's works? No, it is not. This is using the "red flag" to oppose the "red flag"!

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the study and application of Chairman Mao's works must be done by bringing the problems of the Cultural Revolution to Chairman Mao's works to find the stand, viewpoint, and method, and to solve these problems according to Mao Zedong Thought. The comrades of the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters and other revolutionary organizations are doing just that. When a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and a few stubborn adherents of the bourgeois reactionary line use reactionary economism to deceive the masses, incite the masses to fight against the masses, disrupt production, disrupt transportation, and launch a frenzied attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat, they raise high the great red banner of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and give a timely and resolute counterattack. They truly understand and apply Chairman Mao's works deeply and well. They are models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many comrades like the revolutionary workers of Shanghai have emerged as models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. In the future, there will certainly be more advanced collectives and model individuals who study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path forward for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The boundless light of Chairman Mao's works is the beacon for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With the vigorous development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is emerging. Let us resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to arms and welcome the new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

    在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作
    林杰
    不久前，林彪同志指示说：现在全国正在进行无产阶级文化大革命，全党全国学习毛主席著作已经出现了新形势，新局面。最近，林彪同志又指示：希望每个同志认真地、刻苦地学习，在全国范围内，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。这是对全党全军全国人民新的战斗号召。
    这个号召的基本精神，就是结合无产阶级文化大革命，活学活用毛主席著作。林彪同志所说的学习毛主席著作的新形势、新局面，就是指的无产阶级文化大革命把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，推向一个新的阶段。
    毛泽东思想是一切工作的指导方针。无产阶级文化大革命，是毛泽东思想凯歌前进的伟大革命运动。广大群众在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，同资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，同形形色色的资产阶级反动思想的斗争中，更加感到毛泽东思想的无穷威力，更加迫切地需要毛泽东思想，更加无比地热爱毛泽东思想。群众中蕴藏着的学习毛主席著作的强烈感情，进一步迸发出来了。
    林彪同志提出的“活学活用”，基本精神就是理论联系实际。当前的实际是什么？这就是震惊全球的无产阶级文化大革命。学习毛主席著作，必须同这个实际紧密地结合起来。这是掀起活学活用毛主席著作新高潮的决定关键，也是无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的保证。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作，首先要响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，关心国家大事，敢于投身到无产阶级文化大革命的斗争的漩涡中心去。“用”，就是批判，就是斗争，就是革命，就是敢于造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，敢于打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。那些走资本主义道路的当权派，那些坚持反动路线的顽固分子，为了搞混阶级阵线，欺骗群众，便混在革命群众中打起“批判”资产阶级反动路线的旗号。只有真正活学活用毛主席著作，才能透过现象，把握本质，认清他们的真面目；才能不犹豫，不观望，坚决地同他们作斗争。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作，就要善于学习同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线进行斗争的本领。“用”，就是用毛泽东思想指导运动，去战胜敌人。毛主席说：“当前的运动的特点是什么？它有什么规律性？如何指导这个运动？这些都是实际的问题。”“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”这些话，是毛主席在抗日战争时期说的，今天，重温这些教导，特别亲切。
    在运动中，各个阶级、各种社会政治力量，都要顽强地表现自己。各种思潮，各种矛盾，各种问题，各种意见，都表现出来了，迫使人们去思考，去分析，去批判，去解决。我们要提高自己的政治敏感性，抓住阶级斗争的脉搏，善于及时发现运动中暴露出来的新矛盾，新问题和活思想；按照毛泽东思想，分析各个阶级、各种政治力量的关系，研究它们的政治动向，掌握和运用正确的战略战术，依靠革命左派，争取、团结大多数，夺取一个又一个的胜利。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作，就要用毛泽东思想来改造自己的世界观。无产阶级文化大革命这场阶级斗争的暴风雨，向人们提出了许多重大政治问题，迫使人们表明爱憎，决定取舍，从而触及了人们灵魂深处的东西。我们要用毛泽东思想这面镜子，来对照自己，促进自己的思想革命化。一旦发现自己犯了错误或者站错了立场，就一定要勇于承认和改正错误，而不是文过饰非，讳疾忌医。
    有的地方的负责人，故意把学习毛主席著作同无产阶级文化大革命对立起来。他们召开几千人、几万人的学习毛主席著作的讲用会，但是，却不准联系文化大革命，相反地，对坚持学习毛主席著作要联系文化大革命的同志进行打击。
    还有一些负责人，故意利用群众自我革命的积极性，搞人人过关，挑动群众斗群众，转移斗争的大方向，放跑党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    这能叫做领导群众学习毛主席著作吗？不，不是，这是打着“红旗”反红旗！
    在无产阶级文化大革命中活学活用毛主席著作，必须是带着文化大革命中的问题，从毛主席著作中去找立场、观点和方法，按照毛泽东思想来解决这些问题。上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命组织的同志们，就是这样做的。当党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，用反动的经济主义来欺骗群众，挑动群众斗群众，破坏生产，破坏交通，猖狂地向无产阶级专政进攻时，他们高举毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，及时地予以坚决的反击。他们对于毛主席著作真正是懂得深，用得好。他们是活学活用毛主席著作的模范。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，已经涌现出了许多像上海革命工人那样的活学活用毛主席著作的标兵，今后必将涌现出更多的活学活用毛主席著作的先进集体和模范人物。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的前进道路。光焰无际的毛主席著作，是无产阶级文化大革命的指南。随着无产阶级文化大革命的蓬勃发展，一个新的活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，正在出现。让我们坚决响应林彪同志的战斗号召，迎接活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
