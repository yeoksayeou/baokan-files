The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has transformed the appearance of the public buses in Jinan City, Shandong Province. Look! Inside and outside the buses, Chairman Mao's quotations shine brightly, and the portrait of our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, is prominently displayed in the vehicle. Listen! The bus is filled with the sound of reciting Chairman Mao's quotations and songs praising Chairman Mao. People cannot help but exclaim: Truly, the car is full of sunshine and red!

"Serve the people well and propagate Mao Zedong Thought!" This is the unanimous voice of the crew members. To propagate Mao Zedong Thought well, they seize every opportunity to study and memorize Chairman Mao's quotations. Some crew members who are not very literate have others teach them word by word, and they memorize word by word.

The crew members recite Chairman Mao's quotations on the bus, educating others and also educating themselves. Once, on Bus Route 107, crew member Liu Hua recited a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations to the passengers: "White's selfless dedication, expressed in his extreme responsibility to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people." When the bus reached Weisan Road, a woman with a four-year-old child boarded and anxiously asked, "Comrade, what time is it? I live at No. 98 Zhongdahuang Street. Can I make it back in time for the 9:00 train if I drop off the child at home?" Liu Hua looked at her watch; it was already 8:20! The quotation from Chairman Mao she had just read inspired her, and she immediately said to the woman, "Comrade, I'll take the child home for you." The woman thanked her and, reassured, handed the child to Liu Hua and hurried to catch the train. When the bus reached Weiqi Road, a female passenger stood up and said to Liu Hua, "Comrade, I'll take the child home, so you won't be delayed in your work." This passenger lived on another street and, after getting off the bus, took a detour to deliver the child to her home.

专栏：大学毛主席著作  大立毛泽东思想

    满车阳光满车红
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流，把山东省济南市内人民汽车的面貌冲刷得焕然一新。看吧！车里车外都是红光闪闪的毛主席语录，车厢里端端正正地高挂我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的像。听吧！车厢里响彻着朗读毛主席语录声和歌颂毛主席的歌声。人们情不自禁地称赞：真是满车阳光满车红啊！
    “既要当好人民的服务员，又要当好毛泽东思想的宣传员！”这是乘务员共同的声音。为了宣传好毛泽东思想，他们抓紧一切时间，学习和背诵毛主席语录。有的乘务员识字不多，就让别人一字一句地教，自己一字一句地背。
    乘务员在车上朗读毛主席语录，教育了别人，也教育了自己。一次，一路一○七号汽车上，乘务员刘华向乘客朗读了一段毛主席语录：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。”汽车开到纬三路站时，一位女同志带着一个四岁左右的孩子，上了车就焦急地问：“同志！几点了？我家住在中大槐树九十八号，把孩子送到家里，回来赶九点的火车来得及吗？”刘华看了看表，已经八点二十分了！刚才读过的毛主席语录激励着她，她立即对那位女同志说：“同志，我替你把孩子送回家去。”那位女同志连忙道谢，放心地把孩子交给了刘华，就赶火车去了。当汽车开到纬七路时，车上的一位女同志站起身来对刘华说：“同志，我送这孩子回家，不要耽误你的工作。”这位女同志住在另一条街，下车后绕道把孩子送到了家。
