The official organ of the Ceylon Communist Party, the Sinhala-language newspaper *Labour News*, began publishing daily on January 2. Since then, it has featured quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong every day. On January 5, it published an article highly praising Mao Zedong Thought, stating that "spreading Mao Zedong Thought, which has liberated 700 million Chinese people, is the only path for the oppressed and revolutionary people to achieve victory in their struggles."

The article points out: "Comrade Mao Zedong has comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. The thought of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong, is contemporary Marxism. Therefore, anyone who opposes Mao Zedong Thought is opposing Marxism. Today, the dividing line between who is and who is not a Marxist-Leninist is determined by one's attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought and China."

The article states that modern revisionism in the Soviet Union and American imperialism today fear China, and they are even more afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. "They fear that the thought of Mao Zedong, which has developed the ideas of Marx and Lenin, will be grasped by the people of the whole world." "Imperialism and revisionism fear the people. They are most afraid of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought."

The article points out: "When the masses grasp the theory, the theory becomes a great material force. When the masses are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, this becomes a great force."

The article states: "Mao Zedong Thought gives life to revolutionary people, and it causes the death of the revisionism of Khrushchev and reactionaries. For revolutionaries, it is life. For all revolutionaries and oppressed people, there is no greater treasure than this."

The article enthusiastically praises the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao Zedong as "unprecedented in history." The article states: "The theory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong is a further development of Marxism-Leninism. This epoch-making development ensures that the socialist society will not regress to capitalism, and the dictatorship of the proletariat will not regress to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

    毛泽东思想对革命者来说就是生命
    锡共机关报号召传播毛泽东思想，每天登载毛主席语录
    新华社科伦坡八日电　锡兰共产党僧伽罗文机关报《劳工报》自从一月二日起改为日报后，每天登载毛泽东主席的语录，并且在五日发表了一篇高度赞扬毛泽东思想的文章，指出“传播使七亿中国人民得到解放的毛泽东思想，这是被压迫人民和革命人民在斗争中能够走向胜利的唯一道路。”
    文章指出：“毛泽东同志全面地把马克思列宁主义发展到一个新阶段。当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的思想是当代的马克思主义。因此，任何人反对毛泽东思想就是反对马克思主义。今天，是不是马克思列宁主义者的分界线，就决定于他对毛泽东思想和中国的态度。”
    文章说，苏联现代修正主义和美帝国主义今天怕中国，他们更害怕毛泽东思想。“他们害怕发展了马克思和列宁的思想的毛泽东思想将会被全世界人民所掌握。”“帝国主义和修正主义害怕人民。他们最害怕由毛泽东思想武装起来的人民。”
    文章指出：“当群众掌握了理论，理论就会成为巨大的物质力量。当群众被毛泽东思想武装起来，这就成为巨大的力量。”
    文章说：“毛泽东思想使革命人民有了生命，使赫鲁晓夫修正主义和反动派死亡。对革命者来说，它就是生命。对一切革命者和被压迫者来说，没有什么比它更加可贵的财富了。”
    文章热烈赞扬毛泽东主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命是“史无前例的”。文章说：“毛泽东同志提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论，是马克思列宁主义的进一步发展。这一划时代的发展保证社会主义社会不致倒退到资本主义，无产阶级专政不致倒退到资产阶级专政。”
