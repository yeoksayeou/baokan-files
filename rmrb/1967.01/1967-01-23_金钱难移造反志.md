At a meeting in Shanghai Navigation Bureau to denounce the new crimes of the capitalist roaders' reactionary line, surveying apprentice Wang Jiazhen from the surveying team angrily threw the 1,027 yuan that the capitalist roaders in power had used to buy her and three other workers at those scoundrels. Those scoundrels were then in a state of disarray and panic.

Money cannot shake the spirit of rebellion, this is the revolutionary spirit of us revolutionaries!

Under the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary rebels have been relentlessly pursuing and attacking the handful of capitalist roaders in power and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, making them retreat step by step. But the enemy is not willing to perish. They have come up with new tricks, trying to use the "sugar-coated bullets" of economic benefits to buy, seduce, and corrupt a part of the masses, in an attempt to shift the direction of the struggle. How despicable their methods are! How sinister their goals are!

But we, the revolutionary masses, the revolutionary rebels, are not to be bought with money!

"Money talks," this does not apply to us revolutionaries. Money is only something that the exploiting classes chase after. Money can only make those greedy bastards bow down and worship.

Revolution is not for money, for money there is no revolution! The reason we revolutionaries want to rebel is to overthrow the system of exploitation, to overthrow all the ideological systems of the exploiting classes, to smash an old world and build a new world. Our revolutionary will is tempered by Mao Zedong Thought, it cannot be crushed or softened. For the revolution, for the people, for the glorious cause of the proletariat, we are willing to sacrifice our lives, how can we be bought by a few stinking dollars!

Money cannot corrupt our souls or change our revolutionary direction. We revolutionary rebels will forever follow Chairman Mao, resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line, and thoroughly rebel against those who take the capitalist road and stubbornly push the bourgeois reactionary line. We will rebel greatly and specially, and rebel to the end. Let those who take the capitalist road and their stinking money go to hell!

Down with economism!

Thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

    金钱难移造反志
　　赵帆
    在上海航道局一次控诉资产阶级反动路线新罪行的大会上，航测队艺徒汪家珍，愤怒地把走资本主义道路的当权派收买她和其他三个工人的一千零二十七元钱掷到那些家伙的身旁。那些家伙当时狼狈不堪，惊慌万状。
    金钱难移造反志，这就是我们革命造反派的革命气概！
    在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，革命造反派对那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，穷追猛打，使他们节节败退。可是敌人是不甘心灭亡的。他们使出了新花招，想用经济福利的“糖衣炮弹”，收买、诱惑、腐蚀一部分群众，妄想转移斗争的大方向。他们的手段多么卑鄙！他们的目的多么阴险！
    可是，我们革命群众、我们革命造反派，是金钱收买不了的！
    “钱能通神”，这对我们革命造反派来说，是毫不适用的。钱，只是那些剥削阶级的人物所追求的东西。钱，只能使那些利欲熏心的家伙们叩头膜拜。
    革命不为钱，为钱不革命！我们革命造反派之所以要革命要造反，是为了打倒剥削制度，打倒一切剥削阶级的意识形态，是为了砸烂一个旧世界，建设一个新世界。我们的革命意志，是毛泽东思想锻炼出来的，是压不垮，也软化不了的。为革命，为人民，为无产阶级的壮丽事业，我们生命都可以牺牲，怎么会被几个臭钱所收买！
    金钱决不能腐蚀我们的心灵，转移我们的革命方向，我们革命造反派，将永远跟着毛主席，坚决贯彻无产阶级的革命路线，大造那些走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线的人的反，我们要大反特反，一反到底。让那些走资本主义道路的当权派和他们的臭钱一块儿见鬼去吧！
    打倒经济主义！
    彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
