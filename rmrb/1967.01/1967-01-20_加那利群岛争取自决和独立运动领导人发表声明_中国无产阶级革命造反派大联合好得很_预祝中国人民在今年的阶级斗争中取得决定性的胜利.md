Leader of the Movement for Self-Determination and Independence of the Canary Islands Issues a Statement
The Great Unity of the Chinese Proletarian Revolutionary Rebels Is Excellent
We Wish the Chinese People Decisive Victories in the Class Struggle This Year

New China News Agency, Algiers, January 18 — Antonio Cubillo, General Secretary of the Movement for Self-Determination and Independence of the Canary Islands, issued a statement to the New China News Agency correspondent here on January 18, hailing the new great victories achieved by the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. (Editor's note: The Canary Islands are a Spanish colony. They are located in the Atlantic Ocean northwest of the African continent and consist of thirteen volcanic islands with a population of over 900,000.)

Cubillo said in his statement: "We pay tribute to all proletarian revolutionary rebel organizations in various regions of China, especially the revolutionary mass organizations of Shanghai, because they have achieved the great unity of proletarian revolutionary rebel organizations. The workers of Shanghai have shown to the workers of the whole world that as long as they take the future of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the task of defending the revolution and the national economy into their own hands, they will advance unhesitatingly on the socialist road."

The General Secretary said: "From the other end of the world, we are watching with confidence the progress of China's Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards, and the proletarian revolutionary rebel organizations. We are convinced that all difficulties will be overcome because the revolutionaries of China are inspired by Mao Zedong Thought. The great Chairman Mao is leading the Chinese people forward on the great road of socialist revolution."

Cubillo concluded by wishing the Chinese people that 1967 will be a year of decisive victories in the great class struggle. He went on to point out that in this class struggle, the proletariat of China will unite with all other revolutionary masses in the country to launch a general offensive against the revisionists and all reactionaries at home.

    加那利群岛争取自决和独立运动领导人发表声明
    中国无产阶级革命造反派大联合好得很
    预祝中国人民在今年的阶级斗争中取得决定性的胜利
    新华社阿尔及尔十八日电　加那利群岛争取自决和独立运动总书记安东尼奥·库比洛十八日在这里向新华社记者发表声明，欢呼上海革命造反派在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中取得新的伟大胜利。（编者注：加那利群岛是西班牙殖民地。位于非洲大陆西北的大西洋上，由十三个火山岛组成，人口九十多万。）
    库比洛在声明中说：“我们向中国各地区的所有无产阶级革命造反组织，特别是上海的革命群众组织致敬，因为他们实现了无产阶级革命造反组织的大联合。上海的工人向全世界工人表明，只要他们把无产阶级专政的前途，把保卫革命和国家经济的任务掌握在自己手里，他们就将在社会主义道路上一往无前地向前迈进。”
    这位总书记说：“我们从世界的另一端满怀信心地注视着中国的文化大革命、红卫兵以及无产阶级革命造反组织的前进。我们确信，一切困难都将被克服，因为中国的革命者受到了毛泽东思想的鼓舞。伟大的毛主席正在领导着中国人民沿着社会主义革命的大道前进。”
    库比洛最后向中国人民预祝一九六七年成为伟大阶级斗争取得决定性胜利的一年。他接着指出，在这场阶级斗争中，中国的无产阶级将同全国的其他革命群众联合在一起，向修正主义分子以及国内的一切反动派发起总攻击。
