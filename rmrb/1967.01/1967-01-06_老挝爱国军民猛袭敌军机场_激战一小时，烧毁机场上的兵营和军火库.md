Lao patriotic military and civilians launch ferocious attack on enemy airfield
Fierce battle lasts an hour, destroying enemy barracks and armory on the airfield

KANGO, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station: On the night of December 22 last year, the local forces of the Lao patriotic armed forces and the militia and guerrilla units in Luang Prabang Province launched a fierce attack on the Nam Pao airfield, which was occupied by the enemy, to avenge the savage murder of their compatriots by American aggressor aircraft. Preliminary reports indicate that after an hour of intense fighting, they set fire to the enemy barracks and ammunition depot, fuel depot, and other warehouses on the airfield.

The broadcast said that under the fierce assault of the patriotic armed forces, the entire airfield was soon engulfed in thick smoke and turned into a sea of flames, which continued to burn until 10 a.m. the next day.

Facing the raging flames and explosions from the ammunition depot, the enemy guarding the airfield and its surroundings were in a state of panic. It was not until the next morning that the enemy sent two aircraft to blindly bomb the areas around the airfield and indiscriminately shell these areas in an attempt to stabilize their morale.

    老挝爱国军民猛袭敌军机场
    激战一小时，烧毁机场上的兵营和军火库
    新华社康开五日电  据巴特寮电台广播：老挝琅勃拉邦省爱国武装力量的地方部队和民兵、游击队，为了替被美国强盗飞机野蛮地杀害的同胞报仇，在去年十二月二十二日深夜对被敌人占据的南博机场发起猛烈袭击。据初步消息，他们经过一个小时的激烈战斗，烧毁了这个机场的敌军兵营和弹药库、汽油库等仓库。
    广播说，在爱国武装力量的猛烈进攻下，整个机场顿时浓烟四起，变成一片火海，一直燃烧到第二天上午十时。
    面对着熊熊烈火和弹药库着火后发生的爆炸，守卫机场和机场附近的敌人惊慌万状。直到第二天上午，敌人才出动两架飞机盲目轰炸机场周围地区，并且对这些地区胡乱打炮，企图稳定军心。
