Why was Comrade Xiong Yaozhang able to step forward at a critical moment, contributing his precious life to the Chinese Revolution and the world revolution? In his own words, the answer is: Reading Chairman Mao's books is my greatest need, the source of my growth!

In my memory, the most touching moment was his boundless love for Chairman Mao's works. At one point, he was suffering from a severe case of chronic anal fistula, sometimes causing him to be in so much pain that he couldn't sleep at night. Despite this, he never slackened in his study of Chairman Mao's works. One Sunday noon, the weather was particularly hot, and everyone else was resting, but he sat alone in the sweltering cabin writing his reflections. I said, "Xiong Yaozhang, aren't you hot? Why not wait until it's cooler in the evening to write?" Without looking up, he replied, "My body isn't hot, but my heart is burning. In the morning, everyone else was doing good deeds, but I was thinking about the pain from my anal fistula and didn't do anything. I surrendered to the difficulty." I quickly explained, "Little Xiong, what you need most right now isn't to do good deeds, but to rest well. Once you're better, you can do even more good deeds." He didn't respond and continued writing. After more than two hours, I walked into the cabin and found him lying on the bed with his legs suspended using a backpack strap, holding a selection of Chairman Mao's works, reading it word by word. I knew he was doing this because of the pain from his anal fistula, which made it hard for him to sit, so he suspended his legs to reduce the pain and concentrated on studying. After a while, I said, "Little Xiong, haven't you rested yet?" He told me, "Zhong Genfa, rest isn't my need, reading Chairman Mao's books is my greatest need, the source of my growth!" Listen! What a sincere and simple statement! This sentence expresses the hero's deep class feelings for the great leader, Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao said: "Tens of thousands of martyrs have sacrificed themselves for the people's interests ahead of us, bravely. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their bloodstained path!" Comrade Xiong Yaozhang has made a glorious sacrifice. I will turn my sorrow into strength, seriously learn from him, and make reading Chairman Mao's books my first and greatest need in life; thoroughly transform my worldview and serve the people wholeheartedly for the rest of my life.

    “读毛主席的书是我最大的需要”
    钟根法
    熊耀章同志为什么能在关键时刻，挺身而出，为中国革命和世界革命贡献出自己宝贵的生命呢？用他的话来回答是：读毛主席的书是我最大的需要，是我成长的源泉！
    在我的记忆中，最使人感动的是他对毛主席著作的无限热爱。有一时期，他正患着严重的慢性病肛周炎，有时疼的整夜睡不好觉。尽管如此，他从不放松毛主席著作的学习。一个星期天中午，气候特别炎热，同志们都休息了，可是他一个人坐在闷热的住舱里写心得。我说：“熊耀章，不热吗？晚上凉爽一点再写吧！”他头也不抬地说：“身上倒不热，可心里火辣辣的。早上别人都做好事，我考虑肛周炎痛，什么也没干，我向困难屈服了。”我忙解释说：“小熊，你现在最需要的不是做好事，而是好好休息，病好了，可以做更多的好事。”他没有做声，继续写他的。过了两个多小时，我走进住舱，发现他躺在床上，双腿用背包带悬吊起来，双手捧着毛主席著作选读，一字一句的读着。我深知他是因为肛周炎痛，坐不得，把双腿吊起，以减轻疼痛，专心致志地学习。过了好一会，我才说：“小熊，你还没有休息呀！？”他对我说：“钟根法，休息不是我的需要，读毛主席的书是我最大的需要，是我成长的源泉！”听！多么真挚朴实的一句话呵！这句话，道出了英雄对伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情。
    毛主席说：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”熊耀章同志光荣牺牲了，我要把悲痛化为力量，认真地向他学习，把读毛主席的书当作生活的第一需要，最大的需要；彻底改造世界观，完全彻底为人民服务一辈子。
