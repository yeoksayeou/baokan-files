Chairman Ho Chi Minh Cables the Editorial Department of This Newspaper
	To Express Thanks for the Support of Chinese Youth and People for the Vietnamese Anti-American National Salvation Struggle

	Xinhua News Agency

	On January 17, Chairman Ho Chi Minh cabled the editorial department of the People's Daily, expressing thanks to the Chinese youth and people for their support for the Vietnamese anti-American national salvation struggle. The full text of the cable is as follows:

	To the editorial department of the People's Daily:

	The American imperialists have escalated their aggression in South Vietnam and are savagely bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. I have received cables from many Chinese youth and people expressing their strong condemnation of the American imperialists' savage aggression and their firm support for the Vietnamese anti-American national salvation struggle. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to them through your newspaper for their high internationalist spirit, and convey to them: The American imperialists' war of violence against Vietnam will never shake the Vietnamese people's iron will and determination to resist America and save the nation. Under the broad sympathy and support of the great Chinese people and the progressive people of the world, the entire Party, army, and people of Vietnam will unite as one, fearing neither hardship nor sacrifice, and fight resolutely to the final victory; defend the North, liberate the South, and achieve national reunification.

	With revolutionary greetings!

	Ho Chi Minh

	January 17, 1967

    美帝国主义在越南南方扩大侵略战争；对越南民主共和国进行野蛮轰炸。我收到了中国许多青少年和人民群众援越抗美集会的来电，表示严厉谴责美帝国主义穷凶极恶的侵略罪行和坚决支持越南抗美救国斗争。对他们高度的国际主义精神，请贵报代我表示衷心感谢，并转告他们：美帝国主义对越南的战争暴力，绝不能动摇越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。在伟大的中国人民和全世界进步人民的广泛同情和支持下，越南全党、全军和全民团结一致，不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲，坚决战斗到最后胜利；保卫北方，解放南方，实现祖国的统一。
