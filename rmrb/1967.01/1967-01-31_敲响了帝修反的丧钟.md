The great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, our great leader Chairman Mao, personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has sounded the death knell for imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and has sentenced the old world to death!

We, the Red Guards who are the most loyal followers of Chairman Mao, stand tall and proud, with boundless spirit, stepping onto the stage of international class struggle, loudly proclaiming the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought:

The principles of Marxism are numerous, but ultimately, they boil down to one sentence: "Rebellion is justified."

We will rebel! We will rebel against imperialism, against revisionism, against the reactionaries of all countries, and against the old world!

Rebel! Rebel!! Rebel!!!

We will sweep away all harmful elements, overthrow imperialism, overthrow revisionism, and overthrow all reactionaries!

Strike! Strike!! Strike!!!

Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has achieved a great victory that has shaken the world. Revolutionary people around the world enthusiastically acclaim our Cultural Revolution for making "a tremendous contribution to the revolutionary cause of the whole world" and highly praise it for "deciding the future of New China and the future of the world."

The old world is tottering on the brink of collapse. Imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are trembling with fear. However, our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us:

"The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat; they will make their last struggles." Imperialist bosses, Soviet revisionist traitors, when your dream of restoring capitalism in China is shattered by the thunder and lightning of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and when your hope for the "peaceful evolution" of the third generation is smashed by the Red Guards, you are so enraged that you jump up and down, go crazy, and gnash your teeth. You scream and howl like ghosts and wolves, shouting that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to "destroy everything"; that the Red Guards are a bunch of "hooligans," "running amok."

In this regard, the Soviet revisionist traitors have been particularly active and enthusiastic recently.

Listen up, you pack of Soviet revisionist traitors: your malicious slanders and shameless insults cannot harm us in the slightest. This only proves that we are right and that we are doing well! The Chinese people have grown and strengthened in the face of the enemy's slanders and insults. Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to challenge revisionism, to open fire on the old world! It is to eliminate all harmful elements in the world! It is to overthrow you traitors who have betrayed Marxism-Leninism, sold out the interests of the proletarian revolution, and done all kinds of evil! It is to destroy the old world and create a new world bathed in the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought!

In your eyes, we Red Guards are all "hooligans," running amok everywhere. Let me tell you, we are indeed mortal enemies with you, and we are the "hooligans" who will overthrow you! As long as you exist, we will "run amok," until we have thrown imperialism, revisionism, and all harmful elements into the eighteenth layer of hell, until we have smashed the capitalist system to smithereens, until we have completely buried the stinking culture, stinking thoughts, stinking customs, and stinking habits of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has wisely pointed out: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." Let the revisionists wail and cry! "In this small globe, a few flies bump into the wall. Buzzing loudly, a few wails, a few sobs." Your hysterical outbursts cannot save you from your doom.

All the jumping jacks who try to block the surging tide of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be drowned by the surging waves! All demons and monsters will be crushed under the wheels of history!

　　敲响了帝修反的丧钟
    全世界革命人民伟大的导师、我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的丧钟，宣判了旧世界的死刑！
    我们，毛主席最忠实的红卫兵，威风凛凛，豪气冲天，踏上国际阶级斗争的舞台，大声地宣告毛泽东思想的伟大真理：
    马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：“造反有理。”
    我们要造反！大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造各国反动派的反，大造旧世界的反！
    反！反！！反！！！
    我们要扫除一切害人虫，打倒帝国主义，打倒修正主义，打倒一切反动派！
    打！打！！打！！！
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，取得了震撼全世界的伟大胜利。世界革命人民热烈地欢呼我们的文化大革命“对全世界的革命事业作出巨大的贡献”，高度地赞扬我们的文化大革命“决定着新中国的前途及世界的前途”。
    旧世界摇摇欲坠，帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派，胆战心惊。但是，我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：
  “帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”帝国主义老爷们，苏修叛徒们，当他们在中国实现资本主义复辟的美梦被我们无产阶级文化大革命的轰雷闪电惊破，他们指望我们第三代“和平演变”的妄想被红卫兵粉碎的时候，他们气得暴跳如雷，急得疯疯癫癫，恨得咬牙切齿。他们声嘶力竭、鬼哭狼嚎般地叫喊什么中国的无产阶级文化大革命是要“捣毁一切”；什么红卫兵是一群“暴徒”，“横行霸道”。
    这方面，苏修叛徒们最近表现得特别起劲，特别卖力。
    苏修的狐群狗党们，竖起你们的耳朵听着：你们恶毒的诬蔑、无耻的谩骂，损伤不了我们一根毫毛。这正好证明我们做得对，做得好！中国人民就是在敌人的诬蔑、谩骂中成长壮大的。我们的无产阶级文化大革命就是要向修正主义挑战，向旧世界开火！就是要在全世界消灭一切害人虫！就是要打倒你们这些背叛马列主义、出卖无产阶级革命利益、做尽坏事的修正主义者！就是要捣毁旧世界，创造一个毛泽东思想照耀下的红彤彤的新世界！
    在你们这些帝国主义的奴才眼里，我们红卫兵个个是“暴徒”，到处在“横冲直撞”。告诉你们，我们就是与你们不共戴天，就是要做革你们命的“暴徒”！只要你们还存在一天，我们就要“横冲直撞”，直到把帝国主义、修正主义和一切害人虫统统打入十八层地狱，直到把资本主义制度打得稀巴烂，直到把资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的臭文化、臭思想、臭风俗、臭习惯彻底埋葬！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席英明地指出：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”。让修字号去悲泣，去哀鸣吧！“小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。”你们歇斯底里大发作，挽救不了你们灭亡的命运。
    一切妄图阻挡我国无产阶级文化大革命滚滚洪流的跳梁小丑们，都将被汹涌的浪潮淹没！一切妖魔鬼怪都将被历史的车轮辗碎！北京地质学院
