Edition: 6

The chief anti-party figure in the art world, Cai Ruohong, was cultivated by the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Zhou Yang. Over the past decade, he has been entrenched in the Chinese Artists Association, advocating for a capitalist restoration and engaging in numerous anti-party activities.

Viciously attacking the Three Red Banners, glorifying modern revisionism

Cai Ruohong harbors deep hatred for the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. He curses, "This is fast, this is good, that is fast, that is good, everything is chaotic." He attacks the people's communes, slandering, "The people's communes have become small kingdoms, the more productive they are, the less there is to eat." He praises Khrushchev, saying, "After Khrushchev came to power, he is correcting Stalin's mistakes and doing many good things," and even shamelessly praises the old revisionist Tito as a "hero of the anti-Fascist guerrilla war." In art creation, he advocates learning from the reactionary creative methods of revisionist "artists."

Usurping the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposing the combination of literary and artistic workers with workers, peasants, and soldiers

Cai Ruohong has always opposed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, usurping the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics. He vigorously promotes Zhou Yang's "art for all the people." He often uses the pretext of emphasizing the "laws and characteristics of plastic arts" to deny that artistic creation must combine with the Party's central tasks and reflect class struggle. He says, "Modern class struggle does not conform to the laws of plastic arts and is difficult to express," and also says, "It is difficult to say that someone looked at a revolutionary struggle painting and then went to revolutionize." He opposes depicting heroic figures, saying, "It is not necessary to draw heroic figures." He advocates that as long as something can "give people a sense of beauty," it can be drawn, vigorously promoting works that are "beneficial and harmless."

In his work at the Artists Association, Cai Ruohong, on the one hand, spreads the fallacy that "it is not easy to go to life, go to the factory, workers are all working; go to the countryside, now it is cooperativized, (peasants) are not as easy to approach as before," and on the other hand, finds various excuses to organize artists to "travel and sightsee, ride horses and look at flowers," repeatedly advocating that "painters and poets befriend each other, which is very beneficial," and other fallacies, to resist Chairman Mao's instructions on literary and artistic workers deeply entering life, participating in the fiery struggle, combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and undergoing a thorough ideological transformation.

Selling Zhou Yang's revisionist literary and artistic black goods, promoting bourgeois liberalization

Cai Ruohong participated in the drafting of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Zhou Yang's "Ten Articles on Literature and Art" and actively implemented them in the art world.

In 1957, Cai Ruohong publicly advocated in Guangzhou that "so-called socialism must include various isms..." In 1959, he said, "In the ideological realm, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the question of who defeats whom has been resolved." In 1962, in his major poisonous weed "The Direction is Set, the Road Must Be Broad," he again ranted that the issue of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers has been resolved, and the current primary task is to expand the scope of subjects, and advocated "learning more from the ancients, and we might as well try the subjects and forms that the ancients have used," attempting to create public opinion for capitalist restoration. In 1964, he issued an open letter ordering the holding of a creation exhibition of the 360 trades, openly changing the service to workers, peasants, and soldiers into the service to the 360 trades without distinguishing classes, promoting Zhou Yang's "art for all the people."

Admiring foreign and ancient works, promoting feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism in literature and art

Cai Ruohong admires the "Impressionist" and "Fauvist" masters of European bourgeoisie, holding "appreciation meetings" several times, under the pretext of "broadening horizons," actually spreading poison. He regards the works of the Chinese feudal class, such as Shitao, the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, and the Eight Eccentrics of Huating, as treasures. A worthless antique "Picture of the Immortals Congratulating on Birthday" made him "appreciate it for three or five times and feel touched a thousand times!" He especially advocates the works of feudal class remnants and bourgeois reactionary "authorities," highly praising their paintings of landscapes and scenery, withered lotuses, and decayed willows, and ordering the "Fine Arts" magazine to specially comment on them.

He calls on people to pick up their brushes to depict: the scholar eating chili peppers, the sitting Wang Jinlong, and the kneeling Yutangchun, Jia Zheng and Zhao Ma in "Dream of the Red Chamber" talking, Wang Xifeng's character who is outwardly pleasant but inwardly malicious. In 1959, he also planned a sculpture summarizing the Chinese revolution for the Chinese Revolutionary Museum: "A thin mother lying on the ground, about to die... beside her, a child is struggling to suckle." Openly advocating "the cruelty of war," opposing "gunpowder smell."

Cai Ruohong is very nostalgic for the literature and art of the 1930s and once advocated publishing "Printmaking Childhood" to collaborate with Zhou Yang and others in rehabilitating the literature and art of the 1930s. Cai Ruohong himself is also a figure from the 1930s. His painting "Where Does Suffering Come From" is a representative work that distorts and defames the laboring people from a bourgeois reactionary standpoint. The above is what Cai Ruohong needs for "various kinds" and "various isms"! Unmasked, it is advocating the poisonous weeds of feudalism, revisionism, and capitalism to occupy the socialist art front.

Cai Ruohong has long held the leadership of the Artists Association, being the chief culprit of the revisionist clique in the art world. In this great proletarian cultural revolution, we must thoroughly fight him down, fight him to the ground, and fight him to stink!

    蔡若虹是美术界反党的罪魁祸首
    辛兵
    美术界的反党头子蔡若虹，是周扬反革命修正主义集团栽培起来的。十多年来，在他所盘踞的中国美术家协会里，大搞资本主义复辟，干了许多反党的勾当。
    恶毒攻击三面红旗，美化现代修正主义
    蔡若虹对党的社会主义建设总路线、大跃进、人民公社怀着刻骨的仇恨，他破口辱骂：“这也多快好省，那也多快好省，到处乱套”。他攻击人民公社搞糟了，污蔑说：“人民公社成了小王国，越丰产越没有东西”。他对于现代修正主义却拚命地加以美化，胡说赫鲁晓夫上台后“正在纠正斯大林的错误，做了许多好事”，甚至无耻地称赞铁托这个老牌的修正主义是“反法西斯游击战的英雄”。在美术创作上，他还鼓吹要向修正主义“艺术家”的反动创作方式学习。
    篡改文艺为工农兵服务的方向，反对文艺工作者与工农兵结合
    蔡若虹一贯反对毛主席的文艺路线，篡改文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务的方向，极力兜售周扬的“全民文艺”。他经常以强调“造型艺术的规律、特点”为名，否定美术创作必须结合党的中心任务，反映阶级斗争。他说：“现代的阶级斗争，不符合造型艺术规律，不好表现”，还说“很难说有人看了一幅革命斗争的画，然后就革命去了。”他反对描写英雄人物，说“不一定非画英雄人物不可。”他主张只要是能“给人以美的感受的”就能画，竭力提倡“有益无害”的作品。
    在美协工作中，蔡若虹一方面散布“到生活中去是不容易的，到工厂去，工人都在做工；到农村去，现在合作化了，（农民）也不像过去那样容易接近”的谬论，一方面找出种种借口，组织美术家去“游山玩水、走马看花”，一再宣扬“画家与画家、诗人交朋友，益处很大”等等谬论，来抵制毛主席关于文艺工作者深入生活，参加火热斗争，与工农兵结合，进行脱胎换骨的思想改造等指示。
    贩卖周扬修正主义文艺黑货，大搞资产阶级自由化
    蔡若虹曾参加周扬反革命修正主义集团的《文艺十条》的起草工作，并在美术界积极贯彻。
    一九五七年蔡若虹在广州公开宣扬“所谓社会主义，就必须包括多种主义……。”一九五九年，他又说“在意识形态领域中，无产阶级与资产阶级的斗争，谁战胜谁的问题已经解决了”。一九六二年，在他的大毒草《方向已定，道路必广》一文中，又胡说为工农兵服务的方向问题已解决，当前的首要问题是扩大题材，并鼓吹“多多吸取古人的经验，凡是古人用过的题材和体裁，我们不妨拿来试试看”，企图为资本主义复辟制造舆论。一九六四年，他又指令发出关于举办三百六十行创作展览的一封公开信，明目张胆地把为工农兵服务篡改成为不分阶级的三百六十行服务，推行周扬的“全民文艺”。
    崇洋复古，宣扬封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的文艺
    蔡若虹对欧洲资产阶级的“印象派”“野兽派”名家十分崇拜，屡次举行“观摩会”，借口“开阔眼界”，实际上是大放其毒。对于中国封建阶级的石涛、八大山人、扬州八怪等人的作品，他都奉为至宝。一幅无聊的古董《群仙祝寿图》，竟使他“观摩三五，感触万千！”他还特别提倡封建阶级的遗老遗少和资产阶级反动“权威”的作品，对他们画的山水风景，残荷败柳，推崇备至，并指令《美术》杂志要专门加以评论。
    他号召人们拿起画笔去表现：吃辣椒的钟进士，坐着的王金龙和跪着的玉堂春，《红楼梦》里的贾政和赵姨娘在谈话，王熙凤的那种外表很讨人喜欢，内心却尖酸毒辣的性格。一九五九年，他还为中国革命博物馆设想了一个概括中国革命的雕塑：“一个干瘦如柴的母亲躺在地上，快要死的样子……身旁一个小孩子在拚命的吃奶。”公开宣扬“战争残酷”，反对“火药味”。
    蔡若虹对三十年代的文艺十分留恋，曾经主张出版《版画童年》，以配合周扬等人为三十年代文艺翻案。蔡若虹本人也是三十年代的人物，他所画的《苦从何来》，就是站在资产阶级反动立场丑化和歪曲劳动人民的代表作。以上就是蔡若虹需要的“各式各样”、“多种主义”！拆穿来看，也就是提倡封建主义、修正主义、资本主义的毒草占领社会主义的美术阵地。
    蔡若虹长期把持美协领导大权，是美术界修正主义集团的罪魁祸首。在这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定要彻底把他斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！
