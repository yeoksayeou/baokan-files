Staff members of a guesthouse for the families of soldiers in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Family members visiting the unit praise this guesthouse as a "political guesthouse" and a "red propaganda station for Mao Zedong Thought."

Once, the wife of soldier Dong Jianmin from the Construction Company, Lü Jingfen, came to visit. The guesthouse staff learned that she had conflicts with her mother-in-law, which affected her participation in collective production. They invited her and other family members to study Chairman Mao's works together. When they reached the passage "Women in China are a great human resource," an elderly woman said, "Before liberation, we laboring women were no better than cattle and horses for the landlords. It's all thanks to Chairman Mao that we have our lives today! Chairman Mao's kindness is as vast as the sky and as deep as the sea. Whatever he says, we will follow through to the end!"

Through study, Lü Jingfen's thoughts changed. Then, she studied the "Three Articles" and her thoughts became clear. She said, "In the past, I only thought about myself, the more I thought, the narrower my heart felt; now, after hearing Chairman Mao's teachings, thinking about the collective, the more I think, the brighter my heart feels. When I go back, I will definitely participate well in collective labor and study Chairman Mao's works with my mother-in-law."

One day, four elderly men who came to visit their sons in the army were discussing agricultural production in their hometown. The father of soldier Wang Xinglong said that the production team wanted him to be the livestock keeper, but he thought the job was too hard and didn't want to do it. Cook Wang Hongjun heard this and studied Chairman Mao's quotations with him, and brought out a copy of the *Liberation Army Daily*, reading an article about a soldier who actively applied the "Three Articles" to raise pigs for the revolution. This inspired Grandpa Wang. He said, "Chairman Mao has already criticized me. I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words." After returning home, he took over the job of livestock keeper.

专栏：大学毛主席著作  大立毛泽东思想

    “政治招待所”
    解放军某部战士家属招待所的工作人员，积极宣传毛泽东思想。来部队的家属们称赞这个招待所是“政治招待所”，是“毛泽东思想的红色宣传站”。
    有一次，架设连战士董建民的爱人吕景芬来了。招待所的同志了解到她与婆婆有矛盾，影响参加集体生产，就邀她和别的家属一起学习毛主席著作。当学到“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源”的一段语录时，有一位老大娘说：“解放前，咱劳动妇女还不是给地主当牛马吗？多亏毛主席来了，不然，哪有我们的活命啊！毛主席对俺的恩情比天大，比海深，他老人家说啥，俺就坚决照办，办到底！”通过学习，吕景芬的思想有了变化。接着，她又学习“老三篇”，思想通了，说：“过去，我光从个人这方面想，越想心窝越窄；现在，听了毛主席的教导，为集体一想，越想心窝越豁亮。我回去后，一定要好好参加集体劳动，和婆婆一起学习毛主席著作。”
    一天，四个来部队探亲的老大爷，在一起谈论家乡的农业生产。战士王兴龙的父亲说生产队要他当饲养员，他认为这活儿累，不愿意干。炊事员王红军听到后，就和他一起学习毛主席语录，并拿来一张《解放军报》，读了一个战士活学活用“老三篇”，为革命养猪的事迹。这一下，启发了王大爷。他说：“毛主席他老人家原来早就批评我了，我一定听毛主席的话。”他回去后，就把饲养员的工作接了过来。
