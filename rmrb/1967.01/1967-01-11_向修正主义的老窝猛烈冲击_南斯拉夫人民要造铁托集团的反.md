Over the past year, the broad masses of the Yugoslav people have become increasingly aware and have angrily exposed and opposed the reactionary policies of the Tito renegade clique in restoring capitalism, launching fierce attacks on the reactionary rule of the Tito clique.

Over the past year, class contradictions within Yugoslavia and internal power struggles within the ruling clique have reached unprecedented levels of sharpness. While the Tito clique has launched a nationwide purge to eliminate dissent, it has also organized so-called "public discussions" in an attempt to manipulate public opinion, deceive the masses, and divert the broad laboring people's discontent with the entire ruling clique. However, the Yugoslav laboring people have directed their criticism at the entire ruling class, leading to a massive exposure and condemnation of the crimes of the Tito clique. According to Yugoslav media reports, the anger of the people across the country has surged like "still water suddenly boiling over." Workers have exposed that "worker self-management is merely a formality, nothing is asked of the workers, worker councils dance to the tune of the leaders," and "there is no democracy or self-management here." A worker pointed out bluntly that Yugoslav workers "have no self-management rights at all, living as if under a feudal system."

Many workers angrily denounced the severe polarization and vast disparities between the rich and the poor in society. They said, "In Yugoslavia, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer," "some people get rich, while others can barely survive." According to Yugoslav media reports, the number of unemployed in Yugoslavia has reached 265,000, and 220,000 people have been forced to leave their homes to seek livelihoods abroad.

The Yugoslav laboring people have gradually seen through the reactionary nature of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Many people openly criticized the League of Communists of Yugoslavia as a "tool to maintain the interests of the upper class." The number of people withdrawing from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is increasing. A worker who withdrew from the League said, "I saw many rich and bad people inside the League, I don't want to be with them." A doctor said, "Being a member of the League is a disgrace to me, what is being built in Yugoslavia is not socialism at all."

In recent months, the broad masses of the Yugoslav laboring people have been increasingly outraged and have strongly resisted and opposed the rule of the Tito clique. Workers' strikes have broken out in various places. Workers, unable to suppress their indignation towards the privileged class, have forced enterprise managers and local party and government officials of the Tito clique to resign. Farmers, teachers, and urban poor have also risen up to resist the oppression of the Tito clique.

At the end of last December, students and citizens in Zagreb, Belgrade, and other places held continuous and fierce demonstrations against the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam, further indicating that the Yugoslav laboring people, who have long suffered under the brutal rule of the Tito renegade clique, are currently in a new phase of revolutionary awakening. Their struggle against exploitation and oppression is entering an important stage, and the Tito clique is facing a very serious political crisis.

    向修正主义的老窝猛烈冲击
    南斯拉夫人民要造铁托集团的反
    据新华社讯　南斯拉夫广大劳动人民一年来进一步觉醒，愤怒揭露和反对铁托叛徒集团复辟资本主义的倒行逆施，猛烈冲击着铁托集团的反动统治。
    一年来，南斯拉夫国内的阶级矛盾和统治集团内部勾心斗角的斗争，空前尖锐化。铁托集团在全国展开一个大规模的排除异己的清洗运动的同时，在全国组织了所谓“公众讨论”，妄图制造舆论欺骗群众，转移广大劳动人民对整个统治集团的不满。然而，南斯拉夫劳动人民却把矛头集中指向整个统治阶级，形成了对铁托集团罪行的大控诉和大揭露。据南斯拉夫报刊透露，全国人民的愤怒情绪如同“平静的水突然翻腾咆哮起来了”。工人们纷纷揭露说：“工人自治仅仅是形式，什么事也不问工人，工人委员会按着领导人的调子跳舞”，“在我们这里没有民主和自治”。一名工人一针见血地指出，南斯拉夫的工人“无任何自治权利，像生活在封建制度下一样”。
    很多工人愤怒地控诉了社会上两极分化的严重状况和贫富之间的巨大悬殊。他们说，在南斯拉夫“富的富，贫的贫”，“有的人发财致富，有的人连命都活不成”。据南斯拉夫报刊透露，在南斯拉夫失业人数已达二十六万五千多人，被迫离乡背井到外国谋生的人达二十二万。
    南斯拉夫劳动人民逐渐识破了南共联盟的反动本质。不少人公开抨击南共联盟是“维护上层集团利益的工具”。退出南共联盟的人越来越多。一名退盟的工人说：“我看到盟内有很多有钱的人，坏人，我不愿和他们在一起。”一位医生说：“当盟员对我来说是耻辱，在南斯拉夫建设的根本不是社会主义。”
    近几个月来，南斯拉夫广大劳动人民群情激愤，越来越强烈地抵制和反抗铁托集团的统治。各地工人罢工事件纷起。工人因抑制不住对特权阶层的愤慨，迫使企业经理、铁托集团地方党政头目辞职的事件不断出现。农民、教职员、城市贫民也起来反抗铁托集团的压迫。
    去年十二月底，萨格勒布、贝尔格莱德等地学生和市民连续举行的反对美帝侵越战争的猛烈示威游行，更加说明：长期遭受铁托叛徒集团残暴统治的南斯拉夫劳动人民，目前正处在新的革命觉醒之中。他们反剥削、反压迫的斗争正在进入一个重要的阶段，而使铁托集团面临十分严重的政治危机。
