The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has lodged the strongest protest against the Soviet revisionist thugs' attack on our students in Iraq. The Chinese people will not forgive the Soviet revisionist traitors. Comrade Chen Yi sends a message of comfort to our students and journalists in Iraq.

	New China News Agency, January 30th – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a note to the Soviet Embassy in China on January 30th, the full text of which is as follows:

	The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China notifies the Soviet Embassy in China as follows:

	Ten students from the People's Republic of China studying in the Republic of Iraq went to the Soviet Embassy in Iraq on January 28, 1967, to submit a protest letter against the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique on January 25 in Moscow against Chinese students in Europe. This was a completely revolutionary act. The Soviet Embassy in Iraq not only refused to accept the protest letter from the Chinese students and refused to admit their crimes but also, led by Counselor A.S. Novikov, organized more than thirty thugs from the embassy to brutally beat the Chinese students and a reporter from the New China News Agency. Five Chinese students were injured. The reporter's injuries were severe, and his camera was smashed.

	The bloody violence committed by the Soviet Embassy in Iraq is not an isolated incident. It is a continuation and development of the January 25 bloodshed in Moscow's Red Square, another piece of evidence of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique's collusion with the United States to oppose China, and their hatred and opposition to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. You not only commit crimes in Moscow but also openly run to a city in an Asian country outside Soviet territory to commit crimes. Your embassy has become a den for a group of fascist thugs to commit counter-revolutionary crimes. This is not only a serious provocation against the Chinese people but also a serious provocation against the people of Asia and the world.

	The Chinese government and people express great indignation at this and strongly protest. Let me tell you frankly, the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Every drop of blood debt you owe must be fully repaid. The Chinese people will not forgive you, the Soviet people will not forgive you, and the people of the world will not forgive you.

	Chairman Mao said, "All reactionaries are paper tigers." "The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the long run, only promote more extensive, more violent revolutions." The more you rage, the more it proves that the days of this small handful of traitors are numbered. Your desperate struggles will only hasten your doom.

	New China News Agency, January 30th – Comrade Chen Yi sent a telegram on January 30th to the Chinese students and New China News Agency reporters in Iraq who were beaten by personnel from the Soviet Embassy in Iraq. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To the Chinese Embassy in Iraq, to all students and New China News Agency reporters:

	Dear students and comrades:

	I was very indignant to hear the news that you were beaten by personnel from the Soviet Embassy in Iraq. You are fearless in the face of violence and dare to fight, showing the revolutionary heroism of the Chinese youth in the era of Mao Zedong. I express my sincere greetings to you.

	Your submission of a protest letter to the Soviet Embassy is a completely revolutionary act, and it is very good! I firmly support you. The brutal actions of the revisionist masters are not a sign of their strength but a sign of their extreme weakness and desperate struggles. All those who suppress the revolution will meet a bad end.

	I salute you with the revolutionary greetings of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

		Chen Yi

　　我外交部照会最最强烈抗议苏修暴徒殴打我在伊拉克留学生
　　中国人民饶不了苏修叛徒
　　陈毅同志电慰在伊拉克的我国留学生和记者
    新华社三十日讯　中华人民共和国外交部三十日照会苏联驻华大使馆，全文如下：中华人民共和国外交部通知苏联驻华大使馆如下：
    中华人民共和国在伊拉克共和国的十名留学生，于一九六七年一月二十八日前往苏联驻伊拉克大使馆递交抗议书，抗议苏联修正主义统治集团一月二十五日在莫斯科血腥镇压中国留欧学生的法西斯暴行。这完全是一个革命的行动。苏联驻伊拉克使馆不但拒收中国留学生的抗议书，拒不低头认罪，而且由参赞亚·斯·诺维科夫带头，纠集使馆暴徒三十余人，穷凶极恶地殴打中国留学生和新华社记者。五名中国留学生被打伤。记者伤势严重，他的照相机被摔坏。
    苏联驻伊拉克大使馆这一血腥暴行，决不是孤立的事件。它是苏修一月二十五日莫斯科红场流血事件的继续和发展，是苏联修正主义统治集团联美反华、仇视和反对中国无产阶级文化大革命的又一罪证。你们不但在莫斯科行凶，而且公然跑到苏联领土之外的一个亚洲国家的首都行凶。你们的大使馆已经变成一群法西斯暴徒反革命行凶的巢穴。这不仅是对中国人民的又一次严重挑衅，而且也是对亚洲人民和世界人民的严重挑衅。
    中国政府和中国人民对此表示极大的愤慨，并提出最最强烈的抗议。老实告诉你们，用伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不好惹的。你们欠下的笔笔血债，都必须彻底偿还。中国人民饶不了你们，苏联人民饶不了你们，全世界人民也饶不了你们。
    毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎”。“他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”你们越是疯狂，越是证明你们这一小撮叛徒的寿命不长了。你们的垂死挣扎，只能加速你们的灭亡。
                中华人民共和国外交部
                        一九六七年一月三十日于北京
    新华社三十日讯　陈毅同志三十日打电报给遭到苏联驻伊拉克使馆人员殴打的中国在伊拉克的留学生和新华社记者，电报全文如下：驻伊拉克使馆转全体留学生和新华社记者同志亲爱的同学们、同志们：听到你们遭到苏联驻伊拉克使馆人员的毒打的消息，我非常愤慨。你们不畏强暴，敢于斗争，表现了毛泽东时代中国青年的革命英雄气概。我向你们表示亲切的慰问。
    你们向苏联使馆递交抗议书，完全是一种革命的行动，好得很！我坚决支持你们。修正主义老爷们的暴虐行径，不是表示他们的强大，而是表示他们的极度虚弱和垂死挣扎。一切镇压革命的人都不会有好下场。
    向你们致无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼。
                  陈　毅　一九六七年一月三十日
