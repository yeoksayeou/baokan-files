Revolutionary workers, students, and cadres across the country, along with revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, are enthusiastically welcoming the burgeoning revolutionary peasant movement and the new victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They are determined to unite with revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a mass struggle for power in the countryside and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary peasants across various regions have resolved to launch a massive campaign against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and against the capitalist reactionary line. They will thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism. They will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions to seize the revolution and promote production, striving for victories in both revolution and production.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated January 22, revolutionary masses across various regions and ethnic groups are enthusiastically welcoming the publication of the second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" and the rise of the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai. Revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary students, and revolutionary intellectuals have resolved to unite with revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a comprehensive mass struggle for power. They will seize back all power usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and achieve even greater victories in the proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary peasants across various regions have expressed their determination to take Shanghai's revolutionary peasants as an example, actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, and unite with revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary students, and others to fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and against the capitalist reactionary line. They will thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism, strengthen and consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, strengthen and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions to seize the revolution and promote production. They will shoulder the double burden of revolution and production and strive for victories in both.

Revolutionary peasants, workers, cadres, and students in Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces are enthusiastically cheering: "The revolutionary peasant movement is excellent!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Revolutionary peasants say: The second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" fully represents the revolutionary will of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants! It has ignited the fire of the revolutionary peasant movement, and it is indeed timely! Revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants in Shandong Province, in a telegram to various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, expressed their determination to learn from Shanghai's revolutionary peasants. They said: In the countryside of Shandong, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are attempting to use counter-revolutionary economism to disintegrate the revolutionary peasants and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. However, the revolutionary peasants, while uniting with other revolutionary masses, are fiercely exposing the enemy's various plots and schemes, fighting them down, fighting them to the ground, and fighting them to stink. At the same time, they are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instruction to "seize the revolution and promote production," making winter production a blazing success. Revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants in Chaoyang Brigade, Taicun Commune, Fuzhou Suburb, said: A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in our commune, in order to deceive the masses and evade the struggle of the Cultural Revolution, have issued chaotic vouchers, spent collective funds, and undermined the foundations of the people's commune. We are extremely angry and have resolutely taken revolutionary action with the entire commune's revolutionary rebels, seizing control of stored materials and cash, and foiling their plots.

Revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and cadres in Baoding, Taiyuan, and Hohhot regions are enthusiastically cheering the powerful momentum and fierce attacks of Shanghai's revolutionary peasant movement! Revolutionary peasants in Jinzhuang Brigade, Nandajuan Commune, Baoding Suburb, expressed: A few stubborn adherents of the capitalist reactionary line not only blew the black wind of counter-revolutionary economism into the countryside but also incited some uninformed commune members to abandon and sabotage production. This is absolutely unacceptable! Revolutionary rebels from many factories in Taiyuan, Shanxi, joyfully said: The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have always been our workers' most reliable allies. We must tightly unite with the revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line, and fight down all the ghosts and monsters, including the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in cities and countryside, making them fall like flowers in the wind. The second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" has greatly inspired the revolutionary masses in Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanning. They expressed their determination to learn from Shanghai's revolutionary rebels, unite with Shanghai and other revolutionary rebels across the country, thoroughly overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. Some revolutionary peasants in the suburbs of Wuhan exposed the plots of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the provincial and municipal committees and stubborn adherents of the capitalist reactionary line who used year-end distribution to spread economism. The poor and lower-middle peasants said: We poor and lower-middle peasants cannot only care for ourselves but ignore the collective and the state. We firmly oppose the practice of pursuing more distribution alone. We will resolutely join Shanghai and revolutionary peasants across the country to thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism and repel the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. The revolutionary faction of the Red Rebel Army of Hunan Province defending Mao Zedong Thought said: Only by launching a widespread revolutionary peasant movement and combining it with the revolutionary worker movement and the revolutionary student movement can we smash the fierce attacks of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn adherents of the capitalist reactionary line, and uproot the roots of revisionism.

Revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres in the Northeast region have expressed their determination to learn from Shanghai's proletarian revolutionaries, implement the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions, firmly grasp the power of revolution and production in their hands, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions to seize the revolution and promote production, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. Revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants firmly said: We revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants will not be defeated by sugar-coated bullets, and we will not be deceived by plots and schemes. We must achieve victories in both revolution and production. Revolutionary automobile workers in Changchun said: We firmly support the revolutionary peasant movement, unite with revolutionary peasants, consolidate and develop the alliance between workers and peasants, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve new victories in the proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Revolutionary Rebel Army of Jilin Industrial University, at the "Smash the New Counterattack of the Capitalist Reactionary Line" rally, heard the joyous news of the rise of Shanghai's revolutionary peasant movement, leaped with joy, and enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live the revolutionary rebel spirit!" Many young revolutionaries printed leaflets overnight, posted large banners, and the next day spread this good news widely on the streets.

Revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres of various ethnic groups in Xining, Lanzhou, Yinchuan, and Urumqi are enthusiastically cheying the rise of the revolutionary peasant movement. Revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants in Youyi Brigade, Xining Suburb, said that the rise of Shanghai's revolutionary peasant movement is a great event that will have a huge promoting effect on the development of the revolutionary peasant movement across the country. We must tightly unite with revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres! In this way, all the enemy's plots to sabotage the alliance between workers and peasants will be thoroughly foiled. Revolutionary rebels in Yantian People's Commune, Lanzhou Suburb, immediately held a rally after hearing the second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" and established a unified revolutionary peasant rebel organization for the entire commune. Revolutionary rebels from various systems such as industry and commerce, agriculture, government agencies, and schools in Xigu District, Lanzhou City, also held a rally, resolutely counterattacking counter-revolutionary economism. Revolutionary rebel workers and students expressed their determination to be the strong backbone of revolutionary peasants, launch fierce attacks on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and stubborn adherents of the capitalist reactionary line, seize their power, and resolutely achieve double victories in revolution and production. Revolutionary workers of Ningxia Agricultural Machinery Repair Factory said that those stubborn adherents of the capitalist reactionary line have used various tricks to poison our working class and peasant brothers, sabotage the alliance between workers and peasants, and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. We will definitely make their plots never succeed. Many young revolutionaries of Ningxia University expressed their determination to follow the teachings of our red sun, Chairman Mao, about "intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants, or they will achieve nothing," and to organize and plan to go to the countryside, combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from them, and together thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism, carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high. Revolutionary rebel members of Gongnongbing Commune in the suburbs of Urumqi said: The revolutionary peasants of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang must also rise up in rebellion, thoroughly defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn adherents of the capitalist reactionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in the Southwest region have expressed their determination to implement the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions and launch a comprehensive and fierce struggle for power against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Revolutionary peasants in the suburbs of Kunming said: Good! Good! Shanghai's revolutionary rebel peasants have done a great job! We will resolutely learn from their revolutionary rebel spirit and actively throw ourselves into the torrent of the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary peasants in Chongqing and Guiyang regions, after studying and discussing the second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai," said: The world is full of crows, and the bad guys here also play the same tricks. They angrily exposed the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party using their authority to formulate counter-revolutionary economism year-end distribution plans and sabotage the proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary peasants expressed: We must seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, expose the ringleaders of counter-revolutionary economism, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. Revolutionary soldiers of the Red Worker Combat Team of Guizhou Province defending Mao Zedong Thought, who have combined with revolutionary peasants to establish the Worker-Peasant Alliance Army, to thoroughly expose the plots of counter-revolutionary economism, organized propaganda teams to go deep into the countryside to enthusiastically promote Mao Zedong Thought, sweep away the black wind of counter-revolutionary economism, and resolutely carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Revolutionary peasants in the suburbs of Lhasa have broken through numerous obstacles and combined with the revolutionary worker movement and the revolutionary student movement in Lhasa to form a mighty revolutionary torrent. Revolutionary peasants expressed: We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," launch a campaign against class enemies, do the preparatory work quickly and well, and welcome the ninth bumper harvest year after democratic reform.

Revolutionary peasants in Caojiaguan Brigade, Gengjia Commune, Licheng County, Shandong Province, have resolved to learn from Shanghai's revolutionary rebels, thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary revisionist economism, and be models of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." This is the Red Guards of the brigade studying the second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai."
