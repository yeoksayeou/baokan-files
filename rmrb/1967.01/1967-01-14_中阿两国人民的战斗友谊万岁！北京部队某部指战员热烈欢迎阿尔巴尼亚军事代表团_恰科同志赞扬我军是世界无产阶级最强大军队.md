The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region warmly welcomed the Albanian military delegation

Chako praised the PLA as the strongest army of the world proletariat

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, the Albanian military delegation, led by Hito Chako, member of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania and Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, visited a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army today and was warmly welcomed by the soldiers and officers of the unit.

Today, the certain unit of the Beijing Military Region was in high spirits. At 11 a.m., when the Albanian military delegation arrived, the soldiers and officers lined up at the entrance of the barracks, waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and shouting, "Salute to our comrades from the frontline of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism!" "Long live the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!" "Long live the fraternal friendship between the armies of China and Albania!" Comrade Chako and others also waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" to greet everyone and shouted, "Long live our most respected friend, Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Long live the revolutionary friendship between our two armies!" The soldiers and officers also shouted, "Long live our most respected friend, Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Immediately, everyone together rhythmically shouted, "Mao Zedong—Enver!" "Enver—Mao Zedong!"

In the afternoon, more than a thousand soldiers and officers of the unit held a welcoming rally for the Albanian guests. The unit commander Yuan Tao spoke at the meeting. He said, "We are immensely proud and inspired to have the heroic Albanian people and their army as such close comrades. As our great leader Chairman Mao said in his congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, 'Though separated by mountains and rivers, our hearts are united. We are your true friends and comrades. You are our true friends and comrades. We are not false friends who speak sweetly but act treacherously. We are not two-faced. Our revolutionary and combat friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests.'"

"Please believe that no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely stand together, fight together, and win together."

Comrade Chako spoke amidst enthusiastic applause. He first, on behalf of Comrade Bekir Balluku and all comrades of the Albanian People's Army, expressed the highest respect to the soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said, "In the vast expanse of the world proletarian revolution, our two countries are like two red stars. They are socialist stars, stars of Marxism-Leninism. They make imperialism and modern revisionism feel disheartened."

Comrade Chako said, "The great People's Republic of China has become a grand school for studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Wherever we go, we see everyone studying the thoughts of Chairman Mao. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution further promotes the study of Chairman Mao's works. This revolution has powerfully eradicated the remnants of capitalism, strengthened the unity between the Party and the people, and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our Party, people, and army highly appreciate China's Cultural Revolution." Comrade Chako highly praised the Chinese People's Liberation Army, saying: "This army is the army that has undergone the Long March, the great invincible army, the army that comes from the people, the strongest army of the world proletariat, the army with a high sense of internationalism, which is determined to carry the cause of socialism and communism to the end."

Today, Wang Shusheng, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Minister of National Defense, and Wu Shien, responsible person of the Beijing Military Region, accompanied the Albanian guests to the visit.

    中阿两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！
    北京部队某部指战员热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团
    恰科同志赞扬我军是世界无产阶级最强大军队
    据新华社十三日讯　阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科率领下，今天到中国人民解放军北京部队某部参观访问，受到这个部队指战员的热烈欢迎。
    今天，北京部队某部一片欢腾。上午十一点，当阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团到来的时候，指战员们夹道排列在营房门口，挥动着鲜红的《毛主席语录》，振臂高呼：“向来自反帝反修最前线的战友致敬！”“中阿两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”“中阿两国军队兄弟般的友谊万岁！”恰科同志等也不断挥动着鲜红的《毛主席语录》向大家致意，并高呼：“我国人民最敬爱的朋友毛泽东同志万岁！”“我们两国军队革命友谊万岁！”指战员们也高呼：“中国人民最敬爱的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”随即，大家一起有节奏地高呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔！”“恩维尔—毛泽东！”
    下午，这个部队的一千多名指战员为阿尔巴尼亚客人举行了欢迎大会。部队首长袁涛在会上讲话。他说，我们为有英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和人民军这样亲密的战友感到无比自豪和鼓舞，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席在致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中所说的：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    恰科同志在热烈的掌声中讲话。他首先代表贝基尔·巴卢库同志和阿尔巴尼亚人民军全体同志向中国人民解放军指战员致以最崇高的敬意。他说，在世界无产阶级革命的太空中，我们两国像两颗红色的星，这是社会主义的星，是马克思列宁主义的星。它们使帝国主义和现代修正主义感到沮丧。
    恰科同志说，伟大的中华人民共和国成了一所学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大学校。我们所到之处，亲眼看到所有的人都在学习毛泽东思想。无产阶级文化大革命进一步促进了大家学习毛主席著作。这场革命有力地根除了资本主义的残余，加强了党和人民的团结，巩固了无产阶级专政。我国党、人民和军队高度评价中国的文化大革命。恰科同志高度评价了中国人民解放军，他说：这支军队是参加过万里长征的军队，是战无不胜的伟大军队，是来自人民的军队，是世界无产阶级最强大的军队，是有高度国际主义精神的军队，它决心把社会主义和共产主义事业坚持到底。今天，中共中央委员、国防部副部长王树声，北京部队负责人吴先恩等陪同阿尔巴尼亚客人前往参观。
