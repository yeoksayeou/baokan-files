The winter in Moscow is bitterly cold, but anti-revisionist fighters bravely tread through the snow to the Red Square.

The *Quotations from Chairman Mao* shine brightly, striking fear into the hearts of the Soviet revisionists.

With the Little Red Book in hand, the teachings of Chairman Mao are never forgotten. The youth of Mao Zedong dare to face mountains of knives and seas of fire!

Blood may flow, but our spirit will not bend. The anti-revisionist fighters are as firm as steel.

The Soviet revisionist leadership is heartless and mad, suppressing revolutionaries just like the tsars of old.

The children of China are full of fighting spirit, fearing no violence and bravely resisting.

Class hatred is etched in our hearts, and blood debts must be repaid with blood!

　　苏修混蛋们欠下的血债一定要偿还！
　　冬天里的莫斯科一片严寒，反修战士踏破冰雪来到红场上。
　　《毛主席语录》闪闪发光，吓得苏修混蛋大为惊慌。
　　宝书在手　主席教导永不忘，毛泽东的青年刀山火海都敢闯！
　　血可流，志不屈，反修战士坚如钢。
　　苏修领导集团丧心病狂，镇压革命犹如当年沙皇。
　　中华儿女斗志高昂，不畏强暴英勇抵抗。
　　阶级仇恨记心上，血债要用血来偿！			（本版照片系新华社记者摄）
