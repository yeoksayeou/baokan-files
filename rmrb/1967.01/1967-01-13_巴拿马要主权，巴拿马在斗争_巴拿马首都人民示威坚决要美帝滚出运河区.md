Panama City, January 11th - On January 9th, the people of Panama's capital held anti-American patriotic demonstrations and rallies to commemorate the third anniversary of the massive anti-American uprising in 1964 that demanded the restoration of sovereignty over the canal.

The crowds participating in the demonstrations and rallies reaffirmed their demand for the restoration of Panama's sovereignty over the Panama Canal, denouncing the crimes committed by American imperialism in occupying the canal zone for over sixty years. They paid tribute to the patriots who were brutally massacred by the American occupiers during the 1964 anti-American struggle. The reactionary government of Panama dispatched the national guard to attack the demonstrators with tear gas, but these Panamanian patriots bravely retaliated with stones.

Since American imperialism used the 1903 "Panama-U.S. Treaty" it imposed on Panama to seize the Panama Canal, it has established a "state within a state" in the canal zone, stationed a large number of U.S. troops, set up numerous American bases and training schools, and continuously interfered politically, economically invaded, and militarily suppressed the Panamanian people.

For over sixty years, the Panamanian people have been fighting unyieldingly to reclaim the canal's sovereignty and expel the American invaders, and their struggle has become increasingly fierce.

On January 9, 1964, a massive anti-American movement erupted, with the occupying U.S. military killing and injuring over three hundred Panamanian patriots. People across Panama immediately held powerful demonstrations and strikes, boycotts, and shutdowns, with the anti-American storm sweeping the nation and shaking the world. In the past two years, the Panamanian people have continued to hold new anti-American demonstrations. At last year's January 10th rally, a representative speaker stated: "Until the last American soldier leaves our homeland, until the canal zone is returned to us, the people will not rest."

    巴拿马要主权，巴拿马在斗争 
    巴拿马首都人民示威坚决要美帝滚出运河区
    新华社十一日讯　巴拿马城消息：一月九日，巴拿马首都人民举行了反美爱国示威和集会，纪念一九六四年要求恢复运河主权的反美大风暴三周年。
    参加示威和集会的群众重申他们对恢复巴拿马运河主权的要求，痛斥美帝国主义六十多年来霸占运河区的罪行。他们向一九六四年反美斗争中被美国占领者野蛮屠杀的爱国者致敬。巴拿马反动当局出动国民警卫队用催泪弹攻击参加示威的群众，这些巴拿马爱国者用石块进行了英勇的还击。
    自从美帝国主义利用它强加给巴拿马的一九○三年“美巴条约”霸占巴拿马运河以来，它在运河区建立了一个“国中之国”，派驻大批美军，遍设美国基地和训练学校，并且不断地对巴拿马人民进行政治干涉、经济侵略和军事镇压。
    巴拿马人民为收回运河主权和赶走美国侵略者，坚持不渝地斗争了六十多年，而且斗争越来越激烈。
    一九六四年一月九日爆发了巨大规模的反美群众运动，美国占领军开枪打死打伤三百多名巴拿马爱国者，巴拿马全国各地人民立即举行强大的示威和罢工、罢课、罢市，反美风暴席卷全国，震动了全世界。最近两年来，巴拿马人民不断举行新的反美示威。在去年一月十日的集会上，发言的代表表示：“不到最后一个美国兵滚出祖国的土地，不到运河区收归己有，人民决不罢休。”
