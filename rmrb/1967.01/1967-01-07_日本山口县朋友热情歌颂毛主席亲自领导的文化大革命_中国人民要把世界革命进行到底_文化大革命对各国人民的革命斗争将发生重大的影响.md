Friends from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, who recently visited China, enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards movement led by Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people.

Furuya Shoichi said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a profound and fundamental revolution in the ideological realm that touches the souls of the people. I deeply feel that this great revolution will not only promote the friendly unity between the peoples of China and Japan, but will also have a significant impact on the liberation struggle of the Japanese people and the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression."

Furuya pointed out that in this cultural revolution, Chinese youth have undergone excellent tempering in both ideology and organization through forms such as marching and linking up. Therefore, once there is a need, every one of them will rise up to resolutely defeat the American imperialist aggressors.

Kumagaya Takaharu said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China has unprecedented historical significance. It will bring China's socialist revolution to a new stage and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat."

Kumagaya said, "The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, possess a fighting spirit and revolutionary spirit. At the same time, they consciously shoulder the responsibility of the world revolution. They will carry the world revolution through to the end according to Mao Zedong Thought and will build China into the greatest revolutionary base for the people of the world. This shows the true proletarian internationalism of the Chinese people."

Kumagaya said, "Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the entire Chinese people, including workers, peasants, and young students, have been fully mobilized in this cultural revolution. They have achieved self-liberation and self-education, and in the course of struggle, they have further grasped Mao Zedong Thought. Kumagaya pointed out that the power of Mao Zedong Thought and the achievements of the Chinese Cultural Revolution have made the followers of Soviet modern revisionism tremble with fear.

Hara Nagashi pointed out that Chairman Mao's theory that class and class struggle still exist in socialist society is a new great contribution to Marxism-Leninism's proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

Friends from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, also unanimously praised the Chinese people for using Mao Zedong Thought as the banner to promote the ideological transformation of the people and develop production. They pointed out that this is completely opposite to the line of the Soviet modern revisionist clique, which uses bourgeois methods of material incentives to increase production. They said, "Only through ideological transformation can production be guaranteed to develop. Only for the 'public' can the great material force for building socialism be generated."

    日本山口县朋友热情歌颂毛主席亲自领导的文化大革命
    中国人民要把世界革命进行到底
    文化大革命对各国人民的革命斗争将发生重大的影响
    据新华社五日讯　东京消息：最近访问过中国的日本山口县友好代表团的朋友们，满怀激情地歌颂由中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动。
    古谷庄一郎说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是一场在意识形态方面触及人们灵魂的最根本和最深刻的革命。我深切地感到，这场大革命不仅可以使日中两国人民的友好团结获得飞跃的发展，而且对日本人民的解放斗争、越南人民的抗美救国斗争将发生重大的影响。
    古谷指出，在这场文化大革命中，中国青少年通过步行串连等形式，在思想上和组织上都经受了一次很好的锻炼。因此，一旦有事，他们每个人都将起来坚决消灭美帝国主义侵略者。
    隅冈隆春说：中国目前进行的无产阶级文化大革命具有历史上空前伟大的意义，它将使中国的社会主义革命发展到一个新的阶段，并进一步巩固无产阶级专政。
    隅冈说：中国人民具有根据毛泽东思想进行斗争的战斗性和革命性，同时他们还自觉地肩负着世界革命的责任。他们根据毛泽东思想要把世界革命进行到底，为此要把中国建设成为世界人民的最大的革命根据地。他说，这表现了中国人民真正的无产阶级国际主义精神。
    隅冈说，在当代马列主义的顶峰毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，包括工人、农民和青年学生在内的全中国人民，在这场文化大革命中充分地发动起来，做到了群众自己解放自己，自己教育自己，并在斗争实践中，进一步掌握了毛泽东思想。隅冈指出，毛泽东思想的威力和中国文化大革命取得的成就，使苏联现代修正主义的追随者们胆战心惊。
    原田长司指出，毛主席关于社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争的理论是对马克思列宁主义的无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的新的伟大贡献。
    山口县的日本朋友还一致赞扬中国人民用毛泽东思想挂帅、通过促进人的思想革命化，来发展生产，并且指出，这一点同苏联现代修正主义集团用物质刺激的资产阶级方法来提高生产的路线完全相反。他们说，只有思想革命化了，才能保证发展生产。只有为“公”，才能产生建设社会主义的巨大的物质力量。
