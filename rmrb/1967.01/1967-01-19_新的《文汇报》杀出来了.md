	"A noble sacrifice for a great cause, daring to change the heavens and earth." In the new upsurge of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the great situation where Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has won new victories, a sudden thunderclap, *Wen Hui Bao* has been reborn. Let us enthusiastically cheer for another great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! Comrades of the "Spark Igniting the Prairie Fire" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, your rebellion is thorough, it is good, it is excellent!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution is an uprising, a violent action by one class to overthrow another class." The revolutionary rebels of *Wen Hui Bao* are following Chairman Mao's teachings, neither compromising nor reforming. You have taken over *Wen Hui Bao*, turning it into a newspaper of the revolutionary rebels. This power seizure is good, all power belongs to the revolutionary left!

	Our revolutionary rebel newspaper must firmly stand on Chairman Mao's side, hold high the banner of "Rebellion is justified," make the gunpowder smell strong; it must establish a sharp, forthright, and distinct proletarian fighting style; it must turn into a hand grenade, a bomb, to be thrown at those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; it must resolutely open fire on the bourgeois reactionary line!

	Comrades of the revolutionary *Wen Hui Bao*, the struggle between the two lines has entered a new stage. 1967 is the year when class struggle will be fully unleashed nationwide, presenting us with even more arduous and great tasks. But we have the great thought of Mao Zedong, we have the fearless spirit of revolution that "dares to pull the emperor off his throne," and we have the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the workers and poor peasants as our strong backing. The final victory will definitely be ours!

	Comrades of the revolutionary rebels of *Wen Hui Bao*, we firmly support you! We firmly stand with you, rebel with you, and achieve victory with you, striving to make *Wen Hui Bao* a newspaper that shines with the golden light of Mao Zedong Thought!

	May you go among the workers and peasants, unite with them, establish a proletarian worldview, and become genuine proletarian news warriors.

    新的《文汇报》杀出来了
    “为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天。”在无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，在毛主席的革命路线取得新的胜利的大好形势下，平地一声雷，《文汇报》新生了。让我们热烈欢呼毛主席革命路线的又一伟大胜利！“星火燎原”革命造反总部的同志们，你们这个反造得彻底，造得好，好极了！
    毛主席教导我们：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”《文汇报》的革命造反派同志就是遵照了毛主席的教导，一不妥协，二不改良，你们接管了《文汇报》，把《文汇报》变成革命造反派的报纸。这个权夺得好，一切权力就是要归革命左派！
    我们革命造反派的报纸，就是要坚定地站在毛主席一边，把“造反有理”的大旗举得高高的，把火药味搞得浓浓的；就是要树立尖锐、泼辣、鲜明的无产阶级战斗风格；就是要把它变成手榴弹、爆破筒，一起掷向党内走资本主义道路的当权派；就是要坚决向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火！
    《文汇报》的革命战友们，两条路线的大搏斗进入了新的阶段。一九六七年是全国全面展开阶级斗争的一年，给我们提出了更加艰巨更加伟大的任务。但是，我们有伟大的毛泽东思想，我们有“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命造反的大无畏精神，有无产阶级文化大革命的主力军——工人、贫下中农做坚强后盾，最后胜利一定是属于我们的！
    《文汇报》的革命造反派同志们，我们最坚决支持你们！我们坚决和你们团结在一起，造反在一起，胜利在一起，努力把《文汇报》办成一张毛泽东思想金光闪闪、光芒万丈的报纸！
    愿你们走到工农群众中去，和工农结合，树立无产阶级世界观，成为名副其实的无产阶级新闻战士。
