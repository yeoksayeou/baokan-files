The great image of Chairman Mao inspires people of all countries.

Revolutionary people of all countries love Chairman Mao boundlessly and regard him as the great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander of the world's revolutionary people. Many people yearn day and night to see Chairman Mao. They cherish Chairman Mao's photographs and badges, drawing immense inspiration from them.

In Pakistan, many people cut out Chairman Mao's photographs from Chinese publications, frame them, and hang them on the wall. Some students even draw Chairman Mao's portrait themselves and write below it: "Great Leader Mao Zedong." Some Pakistanis who have visited China give Mao Zedong badges as the most precious gifts to their friends. A Pakistani friend who received a Mao Zedong badge proudly said: "To wear Chairman Mao's badge on my chest is my greatest honor, because Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary helmsman of our time whom I respect and love boundlessly."

A Burmese friend wrote a letter to Chinese comrades asking for a photograph of Chairman Mao. He said: "I want to hang Chairman Mao's photograph at home to show him my highest respect forever." He said: "If someone asks me to point out who is the greatest leader of the workers, peasants, and laboring people in the world today, I will point to Chairman Mao." A group of Burmese youths wrote a letter to Chinese friends asking for Mao Zedong badges. They said: "We want to wear Mao Zedong badges on our chests so that the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought can always shine upon us." They said: "Chairman Mao is not only the great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander of the Chinese people but also of the world's people. Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people but also in the hearts of the people of the whole world."

A Mongolian woman, after receiving a photograph of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards, happily said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader. Having Chairman Mao's portrait at home is like having a red sun in my heart. I will always hang Chairman Mao's portrait in our home."

A Tanzanian worker repeatedly asked Chinese friends to find a portrait of Chairman Mao for him to hang in the center of his room. He said passionately: "Chairman Mao is the most brilliant and outstanding leader in the world. 'I want to see Chairman Mao every day. Seeing Chairman Mao is like seeing the bright future of the world!'"

Somali middle school student Nasser received two portraits of Chairman Mao. He planned to hang one in his bedroom and give the other to his best friend. His father saw this and asked Nasser to hang one portrait of Chairman Mao in the living room. Nasser drew two copies of the portrait himself, gave one to his friend, and hung the other in his school so that more people could often see the great image of Chairman Mao. A Somali journalist received a colored portrait of Chairman Mao and hugged the portrait to his chest, saying excitedly: "Wonderful! I will hang the portrait at home so that Chairman Mao's brilliance can light up my home."

Several British friends agreed to hang a large portrait of Chairman Mao in the place where they often gather.

An American shipbuilder, after receiving a Mao Zedong badge, excitedly said: "I am very happy because I am the first to receive Chairman Mao's badge."
