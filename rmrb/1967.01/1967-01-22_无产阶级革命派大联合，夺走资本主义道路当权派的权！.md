A great revolutionary storm of the proletarian revolutionary rebels uniting to seize power is sweeping across the entire country with the irresistible force of a landslide and the thunderous might of a storm, under the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao. The most magnificent festival of the proletarian revolutionary rebels has arrived! The death knell of all monsters and demons has sounded! Let us raise our hands high and cheer loudly: The great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, seizing power from the capitalist roaders, is excellent! It is indeed excellent!

This is a new leap in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. This is a great beginning of the nationwide class struggle in 1967.

This is an extremely great innovation in the international communist movement, an unprecedented event in human history, and a matter of great significance for the future of the world and the destiny of mankind.

In a socialist society, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, with the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels as the core, form a mighty revolutionary force. They seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the Party and the stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, from the bottom up. This is a major development of Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist theory on the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power. The victory of the people's democratic revolution in our country resulted in the proletariat seizing power nationwide. However, the overthrown class enemies are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. New bourgeois elements will also emerge within the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for power is continuing fiercely. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been a struggle for power from the very beginning. This cultural revolution is about mobilizing hundreds of millions of people to liberate themselves and seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Only by launching such a great mass movement and a comprehensive struggle for power can we thoroughly resolve the question of the proletariat seizing power and the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The power held by the representatives of the bourgeoisie must be seized! This is the great truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought that the broad revolutionary masses have grasped through several months of arduous struggle.

Why, when the revolutionary leftists responded to Chairman Mao's great call, filled with boundless loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and fired the first shot at the capitalist roaders, were they branded as "counter-revolutionaries" and "rightists"?

Why, after the "work teams" arrived, did the revolutionary leftists not only fail to rise up but were instead subjected to even more brutal suppression under the white terror?

Why, when the broad revolutionary masses rose up to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, did larger-scale incidents of mass fighting occur, even resulting in bloodshed? How many revolutionary pioneers were struck down, persecuted, expelled, and suppressed, until recently, when the bourgeois reactionary line launched a new major counterattack, and revolutionary economism spread rampantly?

The repeated twists and turns over several months, and the stormy class struggles, have deeply educated the broad revolutionary rebels. They have come to understand more and more clearly: the reason for the setbacks in the revolution is simply that the power is not in their own hands. The handful of representatives of the bourgeoisie are so arrogant and dare to bully people precisely because they still have power! Revolutionary masses want to control their own destiny; in the end, it all comes down to seizing the power themselves! With power, one has everything; without power, one has nothing. Above all, seizing power is the most important thing! Thus, the revolutionary masses have united in their deep hatred of the class enemies, gritted their teeth, and resolutely decided: Unite, rally together, and seize power! Seize power!! Seize power!!! All the power in the Party, government, and economy that has been usurped by the counter-revolutionary revisionists and the stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line must be seized back! We must firmly grasp the destiny of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy in our own hands! They say it well: The proletarian revolutionary rebels, the true revolutionary leftists, see power, think of power, and act to seize power! This is not about "personal ambition" but about seizing power for the proletariat, seizing power for communism, and letting the great thought of Mao Zedong occupy all positions!

The great revolutionary storm of the proletarian revolutionary rebels uniting to seize power is a great showdown between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. It will inevitably lead to the concentration of class contradictions and a storm of unprecedented scale. The reality of this great showdown has already presented us with extremely inspiring scenes.

Look! The broad proletarian revolutionary rebels have broken through countless obstacles, taken immediate action, rallied under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, united hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, and displayed a high degree of conscious proletarian revolutionary rebel spirit. They dare to struggle, dare to seize power, charge into battle, and are invincible, advancing from victory to victory.

Look! The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists are terrified and enraged by the great unity of the revolutionary rebels seizing power from the capitalist roaders and the stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. Because seizing power means taking away their lifeline, the last trump card they rely on for "settling accounts later." They are panic-stricken, raging, and having hysterical outbursts. However, all the desperate struggles of the counter-revolutionaries are in vain; they are quickly being engulfed by the torrent of the great unity of the revolutionary rebels seizing power.

For every proletarian revolutionary, this is truly an unprecedented exhilaration!

To launch a struggle for power, the proletarian revolutionary rebels must unite in a great alliance. Without a great alliance, seizing power from the capitalist roaders is just empty talk. Over a hundred years ago, Marx and Engels first put forward the battle cry "Workers of the world, unite!" in the Communist Manifesto, sounding the battle drum for the proletariat's first seizure of power and making the old-world bourgeoisie tremble. Forty-some years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao put forward the great call for "the great unity of the people," sounding the advance signal for the new democratic revolution in our country. Today, under the new great call of Chairman Mao, in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are rallying and fighting under the great banner of "The proletarian revolutionary rebels unite, seize power from the capitalist roaders!"

"Who controls the rise and fall of the vast land?" "We! We! We!! We, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, are the natural masters of the new world!" This is the resounding voice of the broad revolutionary masses!

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary students must combine with the workers' movement and the peasants' movement, linking the struggles in society with the struggles in their own units, attacking from both inside and outside, and thoroughly smashing the old exploitative system, the revisionist system, and the bureaucratic apparatus. The broad masses of workers and peasants, together with revolutionary intellectuals and revolutionary cadres, will jointly manage the affairs of the state and establish a brand-new proletarian order.

The great alliance must be formed in the struggle for power. The great alliance must have a clear banner. It is an alliance of revolutionary rebels, not a hodgepodge of all sorts of things. Those who advocate compromise, reformism, sectarianism, factionalism, dispersal, and splittism must all be overthrown.

In the high tide of the proletarian revolutionary rebels uniting to seize power from the capitalist roaders, a small number of stubborn bourgeois elements will inevitably disguise themselves, sharpen their wits, and try to infiltrate the ranks of the revolutionary alliance. They hypocritically raise the banner of "revolutionary rebellion" to seize power from the proletariat. They are accustomed to spreading rumors, sowing discord, reversing black and white, confusing right and wrong, inciting the masses, and shifting the target of struggle, directing the spearhead against the revolutionary factions, against the dictatorship of the proletariat, and against the revolutionary headquarters of the proletariat. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, heighten our vigilance, sharpen our eyes, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, clarify the major issues, expose all their tricks, and resolutely counterattack!

The fierce resistance of the class enemies is inevitable. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and a small number of stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line are colluding with all the monsters and demons in society, forming a counter-revolutionary alliance to oppose the revolutionary great alliance. However, no matter how many twists and turns we encounter, with Chairman Mao's wise leadership above and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought below, we will surely overcome all difficulties and expose those who stir up trouble from behind the scenes, directing their spears against the dictatorship of the proletariat and the revolutionary headquarters of the proletariat, one by one, and defeat them. The revolutionary great alliance will ultimately triumph over the counter-revolutionary small alliance.

"Many things are urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment." Revolutionary comrades, let us rally under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, achieve great unity, and launch a nationwide struggle for power against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, and complete the great historical task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

If the enemy does not surrender, we will annihilate them!

The proletarian revolutionary rebels unite, seize power from the capitalist roaders!

### 无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权！

　　无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权！
    一场无产阶级革命造反派大联合展开夺权斗争的伟大革命风暴，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召下，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，席卷全中国，震动全世界。
    无产阶级革命造反派最盛大的节日来到了！一切牛鬼蛇神的丧钟敲响了！让我们高举起双手，热烈地欢呼：无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权好得很！就是好得很！
    这是我国无产阶级文化大革命的一个新的飞跃。这是今年展开全国全面阶级斗争的一个伟大开端。
    这是国际共产主义运动中的极其伟大的创举，是人类历史上从来没有过的大事，是关系到世界前途和人类命运的大事。
    在社会主义社会里，在无产阶级专政的条件下，亿万革命群众以无产阶级革命造反派的大联合为核心，组成浩浩荡荡的革命队伍，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手里，自下而上地夺权。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的重大发展。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。我国人民民主革命的胜利，出现了无产阶级在全国范围内的夺权。但是，被打倒了的阶级敌人，他们人还在，心不死。在无产阶级和小生产者的队伍里也会产生新的资产阶级分子。无产阶级同资产阶级的夺权斗争一直在激烈地继续进行。无产阶级文化大革命，从一开始就是一场夺权斗争。这个文化大革命，就是发动亿万群众自己起来解放自己，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。只有展开这样伟大的群众运动，展开一个群众性的全面夺权斗争，才能彻底解决无产阶级的夺权问题，彻底解决无产阶级专政的问题。
    资产阶级代表人物把持的各种权力，非夺不可！这是广大革命群众，通过几个月的艰苦斗争，掌握到的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大真理。
    为什么当革命的左派响应毛主席的伟大号召，满怀着对无产阶级革命事业的无限忠诚，瞄准走资本主义道路的当权派发出第一炮的时候，就被打成“反革命”、“右派分子”？
    为什么当“工作组”来了以后，革命左派不仅没有翻身，反而更变本加厉地遭到白色恐怖的残酷镇压？
    为什么当广大革命群众起来揭露和批判资产阶级反动路线的时候，却发生了更大规模的群众斗群众的事件，甚至武斗流血，多少革命的闯将受打击，遭迫害，被开除，被镇压，直到最近，又出现了资产阶级反动路线新的大反扑，出现了反革命经济主义的大泛滥？
    几个月的反复和曲折，一场场惊涛骇浪的阶级斗争暴风雨，深刻地教育了广大革命造反派。他们越来越明白了：革命之所以受挫折，原因不是别的，只是因为印把子没有攥在自己手里。那一小撮资产阶级代表人物之所以如此猖狂，之所以敢于这样欺负人，就是因为他们还有权！革命群众要掌握自己的命运，千条万条，归根结底，就是要自己掌握印把子！有了权，就有了一切；没有权，就没有一切。千重要，万重要，掌握大权最重要！于是，革命群众凝聚起对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，咬紧牙关，斩钉截铁，下定决心：联合起来，团结起来，夺权！夺权！！夺权！！！一切被反革命修正主义分子、被坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子所窃取的党、政、财等各种大权，统统要夺回来！就是要把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里！他们说得好：无产阶级革命派，真正的革命左派，看的是夺权，想的是夺权，干的还是夺权！这不是什么“个人野心”，而是为无产阶级夺权，为共产主义夺权，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地！
    翻天覆地的无产阶级革命造反派大联合展开夺权斗争的群众运动，是一场无产阶级和资产阶级的大决战。它必然带来阶级矛盾的集中爆发，带来一场空前规模的急风暴雨。这场大决战的现实，已经为我们展现了极其激动人心的场面。
    你看！广大无产阶级革命造反派，已经冲破重重障碍，紧急行动起来，集合于毛泽东思想的伟大红旗之下，团结起亿万革命群众，发扬了高度自觉的无产阶级革命造反精神，敢于斗争，敢于夺权，冲锋陷阵，所向披靡，正在从胜利走向胜利。
    你看！那一小撮反革命修正主义分子，对革命造反派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权、夺坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的权，怕得要死，恨得要命。因为夺权就夺去了他们的命根子，夺去了他们赖以“秋后算账”的最后法宝。他们惊慌失措，暴跳如雷，歇斯底里大发作。然而，一切反革命的垂死挣扎都无济于事，他们正在迅速被革命造反派大联合展开夺权斗争的群众运动的洪流所淹没。
    这对于每一个无产阶级革命者来说，真是从未有过的痛快啊！
    无产阶级革命造反派要展开夺权斗争，就必须大联合。没有大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权就只是一句空话。一百多年前，马克思、恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中，第一次提出了“全世界无产者，联合起来！”的战斗口号，为无产阶级的第一次夺权擂响了战鼓，使旧世界的资产者吓得发抖。四十几年前，我们的伟大领袖毛主席提出了“民众的大联合”的伟大号召，吹响了我国新民主主义革命的进军号。今天，在我国文化大革命的新形势下，亿万革命群众正在毛主席的新的伟大号召下，在“无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权”的伟大口号下动员起来，投入战斗。这就预示着党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的末日，已经来到了。
    “问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”“我们！我们！我们！！我们广大的工农兵群众是新世界当然的主人！”这就是广大革命群众响亮的声音！
    革命的干部、革命的学生，一定要同工人运动、农民运动相结合，使社会上的斗争同本单位的斗争结合起来，内外联合，两面夹攻，彻底打碎旧的剥削制度、修正主义制度、官僚主义机构。广大工农群众和革命知识分子、革命干部，一起当家做主，建立崭新的无产阶级新秩序。
    大联合，要在夺权的斗争中形成。大联合，必须旗帜鲜明。它是革命造反派的大联合，而不是乱七八糟的大杂烩。那些折中主义、改良主义的东西，那些小团体主义、宗派主义、分散主义、分裂主义的东西，必须统统打倒。
    在无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的高潮中，极少数资产阶级顽固分子总会乔装打扮一番，削尖了脑袋，力图钻进革命派大联合的队伍中来。他们虚伪地打着“革命造反”旗号，向无产阶级夺权。他们惯于制造谣言，挑拨离间，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，煽动群众，转移斗争目标，把攻击的矛头，指向革命派，指向无产阶级专政，指向无产阶级的革命司令部。我们必须遵循毛主席的教导，提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，分清敌我，辨明大是大非，戳穿他们的一切阴谋诡计，坚决回击！
    阶级敌人空前强烈的抵抗是必然的。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，正在和社会上的一切牛鬼蛇神，勾结起来，拼凑起反革命的联合，来对抗革命的大联合。但是，无论遇到多少曲折和反复，我们上有毛主席的英明领导，下有用毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万革命群众，我们必将战胜一切困难，把那些在背后煽阴风、点邪火，矛头指向无产阶级专政、指向无产阶级革命司令部的家伙，一个个地揭露出来，把他们打倒。革命的大联合终将战胜反革命的小联合。
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”革命的战友们，让我们在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，动员起来，实现大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，展开全国全面的夺权斗争，胜利完成毛主席交给我们的伟大历史任务。
    敌人不投降，就叫它灭亡！
    无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权！
