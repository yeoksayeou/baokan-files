The Soviet Revisionist leadership clique has recently been frenziedly anti-China while intensifying its counter-revolutionary collusion with U.S. imperialism, further exposing its traitorous nature.

Following the publication of Johnson's anti-China State of the Union message, the pace of U.S.-Soviet collusion has noticeably accelerated. On January 23, the new U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Thompson, who has a special mission to strengthen U.S.-Soviet collusion, presented his credentials to the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Podgorny. Thompson expressed the U.S.'s "willingness" to cooperate with the Soviet Union on so-called "mutual concerns." According to Western news agencies, the "mutual concerns" Thompson raised include "solving the burden of armaments, food shortages, and the widening gap between industrialized and underdeveloped countries." In other words, U.S. imperialism wants the Soviet revisionist leadership to more vigorously act as its accomplice in its aggression against Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Podgorny shamelessly said in his reply, "The Soviet Union is willing to develop relations with the United States." After presenting his credentials, Thompson and Podgorny engaged in a secret talk lasting one and a half hours.

Thompson did not publicly mention the Vietnam issue when presenting his credentials. However, according to a message from Washington published in the British "Observer," the U.S. government saw "actual possibilities" that the Soviet Union would help end the Vietnam War after Thompson arrived in Moscow. Podgorny also told Thompson that "stopping the Vietnam War" would "create conditions and arrangements for solving a series of urgent problems that have matured and for mutually beneficial cooperation between countries."

In fact, despite U.S. imperialism's frenzied expansion of the war in Vietnam, U.S.-Soviet counter-revolutionary cooperation is proceeding rapidly in a broad range.

To tighten their collusion, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union are eagerly accommodating each other. On the very day Thompson presented his credentials to Podgorny, U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara testified before a joint session of two Senate committees, stating that the U.S. is "ready at any time" to take reciprocal action if the Soviet Union shows "a path to peaceful action." He said, "The U.S. would do the same."

On the same day, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk made a statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urging the ratification of the U.S.-Soviet Consular Convention. Rusk bluntly said that this convention "is a step that costs very little but is very beneficial to national interests." He said: "This convention is beneficial to both countries, but 'it is more valuable to the United States.'"

As part of the grand deal to dominate the world, representatives from the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Britain signed the so-called "Treaty on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space" in Moscow on January 27. Meanwhile, according to Western media reports, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been conducting secret talks in Moscow and Washington, "with a scope obviously much broader and achieving much greater progress than either side has acknowledged so far."

Notably, the Soviet revisionist leadership is turning the Soviet Union into an investment market for U.S. monopolies. According to the "New York Times," a consortium linking Wall Street and the American Midwest, including the Rockefeller financial group, is in discussions with the Soviet Union about investing in the Soviet Union and increasing trade. The Soviet Union has "made detailed inquiries" to these financial groups to allow these U.S. monopolies to "help" build factories in the Soviet Union, providing "land, labor, and locally available materials," while American companies provide "funds, experience, and materials and equipment not available locally." To attract U.S. monopolies, the Soviet Union published two full-page advertisements in the "New York Times," openly "inviting" American capitalists to advertise in Soviet publications, radio, television, and other media to "enhance relations with American businessmen." This is the Soviet revisionist leadership's further betrayal of the interests of the Soviet people after opening the door to U.S. and Japanese monopolies.

As part of this so-called economic "cooperation," the Soviet Union and the United States signed an agreement on January 23 to open a direct air route between Moscow and New York.

The purpose of the intensified U.S.-Soviet collusion is to jointly intensify their anti-China efforts. The U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" openly admitted on January 18 that the U.S.-Soviet negotiations not to develop anti-missile systems are aimed at turning around to jointly "deal with China."

The Soviet revisionist leadership's recent shameless intensification of collusion with U.S. imperialism and frenzied anti-China stance precisely indicates that under the impact of the revolutionary storm sweeping the world, especially the profound influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, these traitors are finding it increasingly difficult to survive. The more thoroughly they expose their counter-revolutionary faces, the sooner their doom will come.

　　出卖世界人民利益，疯狂反对中国
　　苏修加紧同美帝搞反革命勾结
　　双方不断密谈签订条约大做政治交易大搞经济“合作”
    本报讯　苏联修正主义领导集团最近一面疯狂反华，一面加紧同美帝国主义大搞反革命政治交易，更进一步暴露了它的叛徒面目。
    在约翰逊的联苏反华的国情咨文发表以后，美苏勾结的步调显著加快了。一月二十三日，负有加强美苏勾结的特殊使命的美国新任驻苏大使汤普逊，向苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席波德戈尔内呈递了国书。汤普逊表示美国“愿意”同苏联就所谓“相互关心的问题进行合作”。据西方通讯社报道，汤普逊提出的所谓“相互关心的问题”，包括“解决军备负担、食物缺乏和工业化国家与不发达国家日益扩大的差距”等问题。换句话说，美帝国主义要苏修领导集团给它更卖力地充当它侵略亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的帮凶。波德戈尔内在致答词中，毫不知耻地说，“苏联愿意发展同美国的关系。”在递交国书以后，汤普逊和波德戈尔内又进行了长达一个半小时的密谈。
    汤普逊在呈递国书的时候，没有公开提到越南问题。但是据英国《观察家报》刊登的来自华盛顿的消息说，汤普逊到达莫斯科以后，美国政府看到了“苏联会帮助结束越南战争”的“实际可能性”。波德戈尔内也对汤普逊说，要用“停止越南战争”来“创造解决一系列已成熟的迫切问题的条件和安排国与国之间的互利的合作”。
    其实，尽管美帝国主义正在疯狂扩大侵越战争，苏美反革命合作却在广泛范围内加速进行。
    为了加紧勾结，美苏双方正在竭力互相迎合。就在汤普逊向波德戈尔内呈递国书这一天，美国国防部长麦克纳马拉在参议院两个委员会的联席会议上作证时说，美国“随时准备好”，只要苏联出现“寻求和平的行动的通路”的情况，美国“就做出对等的行动”。
    同一天，美国国务卿腊斯克在参议院外交委员会发表声明，敦促批准美苏领事条约。腊斯克露骨地说，这个条约“是一个所花代价很小而却非常有利于国家利益的步骤”。他说：这个条约对两国都有好处，但是“它对美国更有价值”。
    作为美苏合作主宰世界的大交易的一部分，美、苏、英三国代表二十七日在莫斯科签订了所谓“和平利用外层空间条约”。同时，据西方报刊透露，美苏双方在莫斯科和华盛顿“一直在进行秘密会谈”，“范围显然广得多，而且取得了比任何一方迄今承认的都要更大得多的进展”。
    特别值得注意的是，苏联修正主义领导集团正在把苏联变成美国垄断资本的投资市场。据《纽约时报》报道，一个把华尔街和美国中西部连结起来的财团，包括大垄断资本洛克菲勒财团，正在同苏联讨论在苏联投资和增加贸易。苏联已经向这些财团“提出详细的询问”，以便让这些美国垄断资本在苏联“帮助”建设工厂，由苏联“提供土地、劳力和当地找得到的材料”，而美国公司则提供“资金、经验和当地无法找到的材料和设备”。为了吸引美国垄断资本，苏联在《纽约时报》上刊登了两个整版的广告，公开“邀请”美国资本家在苏联的刊物、电台和电视以及其他新闻工具中登广告，以便“增进同美国企业家的关系”。这是苏联修正主义领导集团继向美日垄断资本开放门户以后对苏联人民利益的进一步大出卖。
    作为这种所谓经济“合作”的一部分，苏联同美国在一月二十三日签订了开辟莫斯科—纽约直达航空线的协定。
    苏美加紧勾结的目的，就是为了加紧共同反华。美国《基督教科学箴言报》十八日公开承认，美苏谈判不搞反导弹系统，是为了掉过头来共同“对付中国”。
    苏联修正主义领导集团最近这样无所顾忌地加紧勾结美帝国主义，疯狂反华，恰恰说明在席卷全世界的革命风暴的冲击下，特别是中国无产阶级文化大革命的深远影响下，这一小撮叛徒的日子越来越难过，混不下去了。他们把自己的反革命嘴脸暴露得越彻底，他们的灭亡也就来得越快。
