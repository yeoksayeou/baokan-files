Edition: 6

	Beat the bamboo clapper, let me not talk about anything else,
	Let me tell everyone a few words about the harm of economism.
		Factory revolution, clouds surge, winds rise,
		The bourgeois lords are watching and getting angry.
	They do not give up easily, and they are up to new tricks.
		With evil intentions, they launch a sudden counterattack.
		When force doesn't work, they try soft tactics,
		Wanting to buy off the revolutionary left with money.
		Colluding with the landlords, rich, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society,
		They incite workers to squander state property.
		They incite demands for wages, incite demands for benefits,
		They incite the seizure of public housing for themselves.
		They incite workers to stop working,
		Wanting to make factories and mines stop production.
		The railway officials are also doing this,
		Trains cannot run, disrupting transportation.
		They sabotage the revolution, sabotage production,
		Wanting to shift the direction to economic struggles.
		Poisonous! The Shanghai rebels issued an "Emergency Announcement",
		Exposing their big conspiracy.
		The revolutionary rebels cheer for a great victory,
		Revolutionaries across the country praise them unanimously!
		Revolutionary rebels must stay vigilant,
		Those bad guys are always up to no good!
		They spread economism, incite benefits,
		Wanting to shift the revolutionary direction.
		We warn the bad guys, don't think you can play tricks,
		We red rebels have seen through you.
		Revolutionary comrades, unite together,
		Overthrow economism, carry out the revolution thoroughly.
		Firmly repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line,
		Forever follow Chairman Mao, revolution to the end!
		Hey, revolution to the end.
