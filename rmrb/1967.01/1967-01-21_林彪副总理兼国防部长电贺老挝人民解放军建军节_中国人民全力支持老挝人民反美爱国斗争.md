Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao Cables Greetings on the Anniversary of the Founding of the Lao People's Liberation Army

The Chinese People Fully Support the Lao People's Anti-American Patriotic Struggle

New China News Agency, January 20th: Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Lin Biao today sent a cable to the highest commander of the Lao People's Liberation Army, Khamtai Siphandone, to congratulate the Lao People's Liberation Army on its 18th anniversary. The full text is as follows:

To the Highest Commander of the Lao People's Liberation Army, Khamtai Siphandone:

On the 18th anniversary of the founding of the Lao People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of the entire Chinese People's Liberation Army, extend our warmest congratulations to all the officers and soldiers of the Lao People's Liberation Army.

In the past year, the Lao People's Liberation Army and the patriotic armed forces, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, have further demonstrated the power of people's war, foiled the multiple attacks of American imperialism and its lackeys, and achieved brilliant victories by annihilating more than 10,000 enemy troops and shooting down over 200 American aggressor aircraft. This has dealt a heavy blow to the vicious American invaders. The Lao People's Liberation Army has grown stronger and more consolidated. The enemy's attempts at encroachment have suffered repeated defeats. Now, two-thirds of Lao territory and half of its people have been liberated. This liberated area is a stronghold for the Lao people in their struggle against American imperialist aggression and for the defense of peace in Indochina. It represents the bright future and hope of all the Lao people.

The glorious victories of the Lao people and the Lao People's Liberation Army once again prove the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's famous statement that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." It shows that true strength does not lie with the American imperialists who are barking and biting, but with the revolutionary people who are united and dare to resist aggression. In the face of the Lao people and the Lao People's Army, who dare to fight and dare to win, the American imperialists' intensified aggression and interference, and their direct armed invasion of the Lao people, will surely be thoroughly smashed. As our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out during the difficult years of our country's War of Resistance Against Japan: "The rampant activities of all internal and external dark forces have caused national calamities; but such rampancy not only shows that these dark forces still have strength, but also shows their last struggles, and shows that the people are gradually approaching victory." The evil plot of American imperialism to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam to the entire Indochina region is doomed to fail!

The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army warmly applaud every victory achieved by the Lao people and their armed forces, and firmly and unreservedly support the Lao people's anti-American patriotic just struggle until the final defeat of the American aggressors. We are confident that you will surely overcome all difficulties and achieve new and greater victories in the new year!

May the revolutionary brotherly friendship between the peoples and the armed forces of China and Laos last forever.

Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China, Lin Biao

    林彪副总理兼国防部长电贺老挝人民解放军建军节
　　中国人民全力支持老挝人民反美爱国斗争
    新华社二十日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长林彪今天打电报给老挝人民解放军坎代·西番顿最高指挥，祝贺老挝人民解放军建军十八周年。全文如下：老挝人民解放军坎代·西番顿最高指挥：
    在老挝人民解放军建军十八周年的时候，我谨代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向老挝人民解放军全体指战员，致以最热烈的节日祝贺。
    在过去的一年里，老挝人民解放军和爱国武装力量，在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，进一步发扬了人民战争的威力，粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗的多次进攻，取得了歼敌一万余名，击落美国强盗飞机二百多架的辉煌胜利，使穷凶极恶的美国侵略者遭到了沉重的打击。老挝人民解放军，日益壮大和巩固。敌人的蚕食进攻，接连遭到了惨败。现在，老挝三分之二的国土和二分之一的人民已经获得解放。这个解放区是老挝人民反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫印度支那和平的一个坚强基地，它代表着全体老挝人民的光明和希望。
    老挝人民和老挝人民解放军的光辉胜利，又一次证明了毛泽东同志关于“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”的著名论断的英明正确。证明了真正强大的力量不是属于张牙舞爪的美帝国主义，而是属于团结一致、敢于反抗侵略的革命人民。在敢于斗争、敢于胜利的老挝人民和老挝人民军队面前，美帝国主义加紧侵略干涉并公然对老挝人民发动的直接武装侵略，必将被彻底粉碎。正如我们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志在我国抗日战争的艰苦年代中曾经指出的：“一切内外黑暗势力的猖獗，造成了民族的灾难；但是这种猖獗，不但表示了这些黑暗势力的还有力量，而且表示了它们的最后挣扎，表示了人民大众逐渐接近了胜利。”美帝国主义企图把侵略越南的战争扩大到整个印度支那地区的罪恶阴谋，是注定要遭到彻底失败的！
    中国人民和中国人民解放军，热烈欢呼老挝人民及其武装力量所取得的每一个胜利，并且坚定不移地全力支援老挝人民的反美爱国正义斗争，直到最后打败美国侵略者。我们坚信，你们一定能够战胜一切困难，在新的一年中，夺取新的更大胜利！
    祝中、老两国人民和两支人民军队之间革命的兄弟友谊万古长青。
  中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼国防部长　林　彪
                              一九六七年一月二十日
