The Red Guards and Revolutionary Masses Roar!
— Readers Flood In with Letters Strongly Protesting the Soviet Revisionists' Bloody Suppression of Our Students in Europe

Hang the Soviet Revisionists!
The mountains and rivers rise in hatred, the seas and lakes surge in anger, protest! Protest! We raise the strongest protest against the fascist atrocities of the Soviet modern revisionist clique!

Let us tell you, you revisionist scoundrels, the Chinese people are not to be trifled with! Great is the thought of Mao Zedong!

As the saying goes, good deeds are rewarded, evil deeds are punished. It's not that they won't be punished, it's just that the time hasn't come. Once the time comes, everything will be settled. Since you took power, you have used even more cunning and vicious methods than Khrushchev to do all sorts of evil, turning the homeland of the October Revolution into a mess. The new and old debts you owe to the Chinese people and the people of the world must be repaid!

Our heroic Red Guards have the motherland in their hearts and the world in their eyes, taking the world revolution as their mission! We not only want to rebel against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the country, but we also want to greatly rebel against American imperialism and modern revisionism, to rebel specially and thoroughly! We will smash the old world to pieces, and let the new world, illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought, be born in the storm!

It's time! It's time! Workers of the world, unite! Hang the Soviet revisionists!

The Soviet Revisionists Must Pay Their Blood Debt

"The seas churn with clouds and water, the continents shake with thunder and lightning." The current world revolutionary situation is excellent, and the revolutionary people of the world are all exhilarated by it. However, imperialism and its running dogs, the modern revisionists, are terrified. How can they not hate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? How can they not hate the Chinese people armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong? The Soviet revisionist leadership has long since torn off their masks and shed their disguises. This is the second time they have publicly and armedly harmed our students. They attempt to cover up their inner fear with violence, but "lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot," this only further exposes their ugly faces and awakens more Soviet people. We warn the Soviet revisionist leadership, this blood debt after blood debt, the revolutionary rebels of the Soviet Union and the revolutionary rebels of the world will definitely make you pay back double!

The End of the Soviet Revisionists is Near

We warn the Soviet authorities, your bloody atrocity of beating Chinese students is a serious provocation to the 700 million Chinese people, and it is another major exposure of your long-standing anti-China and anti-communist ugly face. Your evil plot to sabotage the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and to sabotage our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will never succeed! The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. You are enemies of the 700 million Chinese people, but you are only a few flies buzzing, unable to shake a single hair of the Chinese people. You are stubborn to the end, and you have only one way out—death.

We warn the Soviet authorities, your anti-communist and anti-China farce will not last long, your end is near. You must sincerely bow your heads and confess your crimes to the Chinese people; otherwise, we, the broad masses of Red Guards, will not let you off easily.

Strike the Soviet Revisionists with Actual Actions

We heard the news of the Soviet revisionists beating our students in Europe and felt extremely angry! The Soviet revisionists are at their wits' end, extremely hating the remembrance of Lenin and Stalin by the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the love for Chairman Mao, fearing that the surging waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will drown them, so they are cornered and desperate, committing atrocity after atrocity. They are doing this precisely to "lift a stone only to drop it on their own foot." We cannot tolerate such atrocities. We raise the strongest protest against the Soviet revisionists! We, the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unswervingly implement Chairman Mao's brilliant policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and with revolutionary actual actions, give a resounding slap to the reactionaries at home and abroad!

The Revolutionary Fires of the Heavens Will Burn the Soviet Revisionists

The Soviet revisionist leadership and the world's number one enemy—the American imperialists—are colluding with each other, doing all sorts of evil deeds. The people have taken note of these accounts, and they will be settled! The Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed socialism, betrayed the world revolutionary people and the Soviet people, carried out a capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, and sold out the interests of the world revolution. They deceive and fool the broad masses of the Soviet people, even suppressing the revolutionary masses. In a word, they are afraid of the masses, afraid of the masses rebelling against them. Why are they so hostile and afraid of Chairman Mao's quotations? It is because they fear that the broad masses of the Soviet people, armed with the brilliant thought of Mao Zedong, will rebel against them, seize their power, and remove them from office! However, the light of truth is indestructible. The Soviet revisionist leadership will definitely be burned to death and charred by the revolutionary fires of the heavens and the world people!

专栏：来信

　　红卫兵和革命群众怒吼了！
　　——读者纷纷来信强烈抗议苏修血腥镇压我留欧学生的暴行
　　把苏修拉上绞刑架
    三山五岳举起仇恨的拳头，五湖四海掀起愤怒的波涛，抗议！抗议！向苏联现代修正主义集团的法西斯暴行提出最最强烈的抗议！
    老实告诉你们这群修正主义混蛋们，中国人民不是好惹的！伟大的毛泽东思想是无敌的！
    俗话说，善有善报，恶有恶报，不是不报，时候未到，时候一到，统统都报。你们上台以来，以比赫鲁晓夫更阴险毒辣的手段，做尽了坏事，把十月革命的故乡糟踏得不像样子。你们对中国人民和世界人民欠下的新账旧债一定要偿还！
    我们英雄的红卫兵胸怀祖国，放眼世界，以世界革命为己任！我们不仅要造国内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，而且要大造美帝国主义和现代修正主义的反，大反特反，一反到底！把旧世界反它个稀巴烂，让照耀着毛泽东思想的新世界在暴风雨中诞生！
    是时候了！是时候了！全世界无产者联合起来，把苏修拉上绞刑架！

　　苏修必须偿还血债
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”。当前世界革命形势好得很，世界革命人民无不为之欢欣鼓舞，而帝国主义及其走狗现代修正主义，却吓破了狗胆。他们怎么能不仇视无产阶级文化大革命呢？怎么能不仇视伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民呢？苏修领导集团早已撕下了假面具，脱掉了伪装。这已经是第二次公开武装残害我国留学生了。他们企图以暴行掩饰内心的恐惧，但是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，这样恰恰进一步暴露了他们的丑恶面目，促使更多的苏联人民觉醒。我们警告苏修领导集团，这一笔又一笔的血债，苏联的革命造反者和世界的革命造反者一定要让你们加倍偿还。

　　苏修的末日就要到了
    我们正告苏修当局，你们毒打中国留学生的血腥暴行是对七亿中国人民的严重挑衅，也是你们一贯反华反共的丑恶面目的又一次大暴露。你们企图破坏中苏两国人民的传统友谊、破坏我国无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶阴谋，是决不会得逞的！用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不好惹的。你们与七亿中国人民为敌，只不过是几个苍蝇嗡嗡叫而已，动摇不了中国人民的半根毫毛。你们顽固到底，只有死路一条。
    我们正告苏修当局，你们反共反华的丑剧演不了多久了，你们的末日就要到了。你们必须老老实实向中国人民低头认罪，否则我们广大的红卫兵战士决不会轻饶你们。

　　用实际行动痛击苏修
    我们听到苏修毒打我国留欧学生的消息，感到万分愤怒！苏修已走到穷途末路，它极端仇视中苏人民对列宁、斯大林的怀念和对毛主席的热爱，十分害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命的汹涌波涛将会淹没它们，于是狗急跳墙，穷凶极恶，连连制造流血事件。他们这样做，正是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。我们面对这种暴行，实在忍无可忍，我们向苏修提出最最强烈的抗议！我们无产阶级革命造反派，坚决高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的英明方针，以革命的实际行动，给国内外反动派以迎头痛击！

　　漫天革命大火烧死苏修
    苏修领导集团和世界人民的头号敌人——美帝国主义互相勾结，狼狈为奸，干尽了坏事。这一笔笔账，人民是记下了的，是要清算的！苏修领导集团背叛了社会主义，背叛了世界革命人民和苏联人民，在苏联实行资本主义复辟，出卖世界革命的利益。他们对苏联的广大人民进行欺骗、愚弄，甚至压制革命群众，一句话，就是害怕群众，怕群众造他们的反。为什么他们对毛主席语录那么仇视，那么怕呢？就是怕广大的苏联人民掌握了光芒万丈的毛泽东思想，造他们的反，夺他们的权，罢他们的官！但是，真理的光辉是什么也遮掩不住的。苏修领导集团一定将被苏联人民和世界人民的漫天革命大火烧死，烧焦！
