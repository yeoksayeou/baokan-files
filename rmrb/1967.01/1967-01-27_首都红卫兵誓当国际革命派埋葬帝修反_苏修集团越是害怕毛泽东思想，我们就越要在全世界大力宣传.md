The Soviet revisionist leadership's fascist atrocity of bloodily suppressing our students in Moscow's Red Square has sparked strong protests and immense indignation among the revolutionary masses of our country.

The "Red Flag" Combat Team of Beijing Aviation Institute, the "Light Cavalry" Combat Team of Peking University, the "Red East" Commune of the Geology Institute, the "Jinggangshan" Corps of Tsinghua University, the Red Guards of the Capital Corps, and some soldiers from the military units stationed in the schools held a rally at Beijing Aviation Institute to condemn the Soviet revisionist leadership's heinous crime of bloodily suppressing our students. The meeting was filled with fervor, with slogans shouted and the revolutionary song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" sung in unison.

Definitely, we must overthrow Soviet revisionism!

Confucius of the "Light Cavalry" Combat Team of Peking University said:

The incident of Soviet revisionists persecuting our students is a new debt of blood they owe.

"The logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the cause of the people is to create trouble, fail, create more trouble, fail again, and ultimately perish." Soviet revisionism will not deviate from this logic.

Our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to uproot revisionism and toll the death knell for revisionism and capitalism. Soviet revisionism is extremely frightened. They use despicable means, which is a sign of their weakness.

A small clique of Soviet revisionist leaders now hold military and political power, but their power will not last long. One day, the Soviet people will rise up and overthrow them.

We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards, fearless. Bloodshed will not intimidate us. We will definitely overthrow modern Soviet revisionism.

Song Shuming and Qing Lixun of the "Red Flag" Combat Team of Beijing Aviation Institute said:

Hearing about the Soviet revisionists suppressing our students and causing bloodshed is intolerable. This incident exposes the ugly face of Soviet revisionism. We firmly believe that the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high in the birthplace of the October Revolution. Now, our Cultural Revolution has developed into a new stage of nationwide seizure of power. We must smash the old world and create a new red world.

Soviet revisionism's attempt to sow discord between us and the Soviet people will not succeed. The friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable. The great unity of the world's revolutionary people will overthrow the small unity of the reactionaries. History will prove this. The Soviet people are a great people. We believe that one day they will rise up, drag out all the big and small Khrushchevs, and trample them underfoot, ensuring they never rise again.

Let Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout the world!

Wu Weihong of the "Jinggangshan" Corps of Tsinghua University said:

Soviet revisionism is on the decline, gasping for breath. They are so afraid of Mao Zedong Thought that our students only read a few quotes from Chairman Mao, and they hate it to the core and fear it to death. Because they fear that the Soviet people will know the truth. We must let the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout the world.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the enemy fiercely opposes Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must uphold Mao Zedong Thought, make Mao Zedong Thought prominent, go to the workers and peasants, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Diao Guohua, Jiang Zuofan, and Han Youmin of the "Red Flag" Combat Team of Beijing Aviation Institute said:

We are so angry that we feel like flying to Moscow to smash these Soviet revisionist bastards to pieces. This incident is a genuine counter-revolutionary class revenge. Since the start of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have become more blatant and rampant in their anti-China actions.

Soviet revisionism striking hard shows they fear our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fear Mao Zedong Thought, and fear the truth. Just as Chairman Mao said: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." This proves that our Cultural Revolution is correct, and we Red Guards have the confidence to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and will not let our proletarian state change color.

Soviet revisionism's persecution of our students is a serious political event and a provocation against the Chinese people who are holding high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

Soviet revisionism fears the truth, fears Mao Zedong Thought, is a great traitor to Marxism-Leninism, and has once again exposed itself to the world. The more they go crazy, the closer their doom comes. The great Soviet people will definitely rise up and overthrow them, throwing this group of jumping jacks into the garbage dump.

Whoever dares to invade us will be destroyed!

Luan Fumao of the "Red Flag" Combat Team of Beijing Aviation Institute said:

I cannot suppress my anger and strongly protest against Soviet revisionism.

The Chinese people and Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. This incident exposes their reactionary nature, and they are acting in the most stupid and despicable way.

The future of the Soviet Union will definitely belong to the Soviet people and the proletariat. Soviet revisionism will not have a good ending.

We cannot tolerate such atrocities by Soviet revisionism. This incident shows how rampant they are. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All attempts by domestic and foreign reactionaries to stop the victory of the Chinese people are doomed to fail.... The reactionary ebb will never become the mainstream." They are definitely doomed to fail. The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. Whoever dares to invade us will be destroyed.

Do not try to stop China's Cultural Revolution!

Soldiers Bi Youqin, Yan Chunkuai, and Hou Rong said:

We are very indignant. This incident shows that Soviet revisionism is guilty and savage. Our struggle with Soviet revisionism is a life-and-death struggle. The Chinese people are not afraid of death. No matter what means you use, the Chinese people will still revolutionize. Beijing is the Yan'an of the world revolution. We will carry out the world revolution. We will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and no one can stop us.

The Soviet revisionist leadership actually sent military police to brutally persecute our students, which we strongly condemn. In the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, the occurrence of this incident is not accidental. The Chinese people and the people of the world will not let them off.

We pay tribute to our students who stand on the anti-revisionist frontline and fear no violence. We will learn from them. The enemy is so afraid of Mao Zedong Thought because Mao Zedong Thought is the truth, a powerful weapon that leads imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries to their doom, and a theoretical weapon that guides the world's revolutionary people. The enemy's fear of Mao Zedong Thought is like an owl fearing the sun. Their actions are not surprising; it is their reactionary class nature that determines this. We warn the small clique of Soviet revisionist leaders: A small ant trying to shake a big tree is laughable and self-delusional. The Soviet revisionist leadership will definitely be overthrown by the Soviet people.

Tang Zhenquan of the "Red East" Commune of the Geology Institute said:

All members of the "Red East" strongly protest against the fascist atrocities of Soviet revisionism. Since the Cultural Revolution, Soviet revisionism has mobilized all its propaganda machines to attack and slander the Cultural Revolution, attack the great Mao Zedong Thought and the Red Guards, and now has committed this fascist atrocity, exposing their extreme hatred for Mao Zedong Thought and the Cultural Revolution. The more the enemy opposes, the more we will propagate Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world and rally the revolutionary people of the world to overthrow imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries.

Soldiers Tian Bohua, Duan Chengqing, and Cai Mingli said:

The fascist atrocity of Soviet revisionism is a shameful political conspiracy. It further exposes the traitorous face of Soviet revisionism. We hate revisionism to the core and love our class brothers from the bottom of our hearts. We not only want to be domestic revolutionaries but also international revolutionaries, burying imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and liberating the oppressed people of the world.

Members of the "Red East" Commune of the Geology Institute, Dai Shaojiang, Cai Wenfang, Huang Shaojin, and Liu Qingtian said:

Our students' learning of the highest directives in front of Lenin's tomb is their sacred right. We pay the highest respect to the students' fearless and resolute revolutionary spirit in the face of strong violence. We will definitely be their backbone and carry the anti-revisionist struggle to the end.

Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts, Mao Zedong Thought is the highest directive for all work, and is the most precious treasure. Soviet revisionism's attempt to block Mao Zedong Thought is absolutely impossible. With Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution will achieve victory.

This small clique of Soviet revisionist bastards dare to provoke the Chinese people and Mao Zedong Thought, which is absolutely unacceptable.

We are Chairman Mao's Red Guards and strongly protest against the despicable provocation by Soviet revisionism.

Soldiers Hou Jiande and Wang Zijun said:

Our students fear no violence and strive to learn, propagate, and defend the highest directives under white terror. Their actions are excellent, and we will learn from them and pay tribute to them.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has struck a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, which also hits the heads of Soviet revisionism. Therefore, they fiercely oppose it. They oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and we will not agree. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the world's revolutionary people, is a weapon, and is a magical treasure. Only Mao Zedong Thought can lead the proletarian revolution to victory worldwide.

　　首都红卫兵誓当国际革命派埋葬帝修反
　　苏修集团越是害怕毛泽东思想，我们就越要在全世界大力宣传
    本报讯　苏联修正主义领导集团在莫斯科红场血腥镇压我国留学生的法西斯暴行，激起了我国广大革命群众的强烈抗议和无比愤慨。
    北京航空学院“红旗”战斗队、北京大学“轻骑兵”战斗团、地质学院“东方红”公社、清华大学“井冈山”兵团、毛泽东思想红卫兵首都兵团的部分战士和在院校的部分解放军战士，在北京航空学院举行集会，声讨苏修领导集团血腥镇压我国留学生的滔天罪行。会上，群情激愤，高呼口号，同声齐唱革命歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》。
        一定要打倒苏联修正主义
    北京大学“轻骑兵”战斗团祁朝东在集会上说：
    苏修迫害我留学生的事件，是他们欠下的一笔新血债。
    “捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”。苏修也决不会违背这个逻辑。
    我们的无产阶级文化大革命，就是要挖修正主义的根子，敲响修正主义、资本主义的丧钟。苏修害怕极了。他们采取卑劣手段，是他们虚弱的表现。
    一小撮苏修领导人现在掌握军政大权，但是，他们的权，长不了。总有一天，苏联人民会起来造他们的反，夺他们的权。
    我们是毛主席的红卫兵，是无所畏惧的。流血，吓不倒我们。我们一定要打倒苏联现代修正主义。
    北京航空学院“红旗”战斗队宋书明、卿礼勋说：
    听到苏修镇压我留学生、制造流血事件，使人不能容忍。这一事件暴露了苏修的丑恶面目。我们坚信马列主义毛泽东思想的伟大红旗一定会在十月革命的故乡高高飘扬。现在，我国文化大革命已发展到全国全面夺权斗争的新阶段。我们一定要砸烂旧世界，创立一个红彤彤的新世界。
    苏修妄想挑拨我们和苏联人民的关系，是办不到的。中苏两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的。世界革命人民的大联合将打倒反动派的小联合，历史潮流一定是这样的。苏联人民是伟大的人民。我们相信他们总有一天将会起来，把大大小小的赫鲁晓夫揪出来，把他们打倒在地，再踏上一只脚，使他们永世不得翻身。
        让毛泽东思想传遍全世界
    清华大学“井冈山”兵团武卫红说：
    苏修是日薄西山、气息奄奄。它们对毛泽东思想如此害怕，我国留学生只读了几句毛主席语录，他们就恨之入骨，怕得要死。因为他们怕苏联人民知道真理。我们一定要让毛泽东思想伟大真理传遍全世界。
    毛主席教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”敌人越是疯狂反对毛泽东思想，我们越要大立毛泽东思想，要大大突出毛泽东思想，到工农群众中去，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    北京航空学院“红旗”战斗队窦国华、姜作范、韩友民说：
    我们肺都气炸了，恨不得飞到莫斯科，把苏修这帮混蛋砸个稀巴烂。这次事件是地地道道的反革命阶级报复。自我国无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，他们反华更加露骨，更加猖狂了。
    苏修大打出手，说明他们害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命，害怕毛泽东思想，害怕真理。正像毛主席所说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。这证明我们文化大革命做得对，我们红卫兵有信心将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，决不让我们的无产阶级国家改变颜色。
    苏修迫害我留学生是严重的政治事件，是对高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民的挑衅。
    苏修害怕真理，害怕毛泽东思想，是马列主义的大叛徒，又一次在世界人民面前来了个大暴露。他们越丧心病狂，越说明他们的末日将来到。伟大的苏联人民定将起来造他们的反，把这群跳梁小丑抛进垃圾堆。
        谁敢侵犯我们，就叫他灭亡
    北京航空学院“红旗”战斗队栾复茂说：
    我压抑不住内心的怒火，对苏修提出最最强烈的抗议。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民、红卫兵是不好惹的。这件事暴露了他们反动的本质，他们这样作是最愚蠢的，最卑鄙的。
    未来的苏联必将是苏联人民的，是无产阶级的，苏修决不会有好下场。
    我们不能容忍苏修这种暴行。这次事件说明苏修多么猖狂。毛主席教导我们说：“一切中外反动派的阻止中国人民胜利的企图，都是注定要失败的。……反动的逆流终究不会变为主流。”他们一定要失败的。中国人民不是好惹的，谁敢侵犯我们，就叫他灭亡。
        休想阻止中国文化大革命
    解放军战士毕友勤、阎春奎、侯荣说：
    我们很气愤。这次事件说明苏修作贼心虚，野蛮无理。我们和苏修的斗争是你死我活的斗争。中国人民死都不怕，不管你们用什么手段，中国人民照样革命。北京是世界革命的延安。我们要搞世界革命。我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，任何人都阻止不了的。
    苏联修正主义领导集团竟然派出军警对我留学生进行惨无人道的迫害，我们表示极大的愤慨。在文化大革命的高潮中，出现这个事件决不是偶然的。中国人民和世界人民是决不会饶了他们的。
    我们向站在反修前线不畏强暴的我国留学生表示敬意，我们要向他们学习。敌人如此害怕毛泽东思想，因为毛泽东思想是真理，是使帝国主义、修正主义、反动派走向灭亡的强大武器，是指导世界革命人民的理论武器。敌人害怕毛泽东思想，就像猫头鹰害怕太阳一样。他们这样做是毫不奇怪的，这是他们反动的阶级本性所决定的。我们要正告苏联修正主义一小撮领导人：蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。苏联修正主义领导集团必将被苏联人民所推翻。
    地质学院“东方红”公社唐振权说：
    我们“东方红”全体战士对苏联修正主义的暴行提出最最强烈的抗议。文化大革命以来，苏联修正主义开动了一切宣传机器，夜以继日地攻击、污蔑文化大革命，攻击伟大的毛泽东思想和红卫兵，这次又制造了这场法西斯暴行，暴露了它们对毛泽东思想和文化大革命的无比仇恨。敌人越反对，我们越要在全世界宣传毛泽东思想，要让全世界革命人民起来造帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派的反。
      把反对修正主义的斗争进行到底
    解放军战士田博华、段澄清、蔡明理说：
    苏联修正主义的这一法西斯暴行，是一个可耻的政治阴谋。它更暴露了苏修的叛徒面目。我们对修正主义恨之入骨，对阶级兄弟从心底里热爱。我们不仅要做国内革命派，也要做国际革命派，要埋葬帝国主义、修正主义、一切反动派，把天下劳苦人民解放出来。
    地质学院“东方红”公社贠本现、戴少强、蔡文芳、黄绍金、刘庆田说：
    我留学生在列宁墓前学习最高指示，这是他们神圣的权利。我们对留学生的这种不畏强暴、坚决斗争的革命精神表示崇高的敬意。我们要誓作他们的后盾，把反修斗争进行到底。
    毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是一切工作的最高指示，是宝中宝。苏修要封锁毛泽东思想是绝对办不到的。有了毛泽东思想，革命就能取得胜利。
    苏修这一小撮混蛋竟敢向中国人民挑衅，向毛泽东思想挑衅，这是绝不能容忍的。
    我们是毛主席的红卫兵，对苏修的卑鄙的挑衅提出最最强烈的抗议。
    解放军战士侯建德、王子君说：
    我留学生不畏强暴，在白色恐怖下努力学习、宣传和捍卫最高指示，他们的行动好得很，我们要向他们学习，向他们致敬。
    无产阶级文化大革命打击了一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，这也打在苏修的脑壳上。所以他们就拚命反对。他们反对毛泽东思想，我们坚决不答应。毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的命根子，是武器，是法宝。只有毛泽东思想才能使无产阶级革命在全世界取得胜利。
