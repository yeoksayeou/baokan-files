The heroic air force units struck down a U.S.-made Kuomintang aircraft in East China on the afternoon of the 13th. This is a new victory in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Currently, the broad revolutionary masses are uniting, hoisting high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and launching a general offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line. The victory of the air force units has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and dealt a heavy blow to the arrogance of the class enemies. Under the inspiration of this victory, the broad revolutionary masses will certainly strike back ten times, a hundred times harder against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and against the stubborn diehards who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, striving for a thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being carried out under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. The People's Liberation Army is a powerful pillar of proletarian dictatorship and a faithful defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With such a revolutionary people's army, we have reliable guarantees for winning the Cultural Revolution. We pay high tribute to the People's Liberation Army for its heroic defense of the Cultural Revolution!

Class struggle in the socialist period is long-term, sharp, and complex. The bourgeoisie and its agents will always launch attacks on the proletariat from the political, economic, and cultural fronts. U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will always seek opportunities to create trouble. The broad revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army must heighten their vigilance and repel the enemy's attacks from all sides.

Let the enemy come and create trouble, and we will see it perish!

    保卫无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利
    本报评论员
    英雄的空军部队，十三日下午在华东地区，击落了一架美制蒋机。这是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利！
    目前，广大革命群众正在联合起来，高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的大旗，向资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击。空军部队的这一胜利，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。广大革命群众在这一胜利的鼓舞下，必将十倍、百倍地给一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，给极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子以狠狠地打击，争取无产阶级文化大革命全面的彻底的胜利。
    我国的文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政的条件下进行的。中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政的强大支柱，是无产阶级文化大革命的忠实保卫者。有这样一支革命的人民的军队，我们取得文化大革命的胜利就有了可靠的保障。我们向英勇地保卫文化大革命的人民解放军致以崇高的敬意！
    社会主义时期的阶级斗争，是长期的、尖锐的、复杂的。资产阶级及其代理人总是要从政治上、经济上、文化上向无产阶级进攻。美帝国主义及其走狗，也总是要伺机捣乱。广大革命群众和人民解放军，一定要提高警惕，从各个方面打退敌人的进攻。
    敌人来捣乱，就叫它灭亡！
