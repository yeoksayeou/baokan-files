Severely injured nine brave anti-revisionist fighters issue heroic statements
Always listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely rebel against imperialists and revisionists

BEIJING, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- Nine Chinese students studying in Europe who were severely beaten by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents on January 25 issued statements to a Xinhua reporter, saying that the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought has given them boundless strength and courage to rebel against revisionism. They vowed to follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and resolutely carry the struggle against revisionism to the end.

Chen Fugeng, lying in bed with severe injuries, told the Xinhua reporter through his pain: "When I was beaten by the revisionists, I loudly recited Chairman Mao's words, 'Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' I had only one word in my heart: 'dare.' He continued, "I also saw with my own eyes that the broad masses of the Soviet people cherish Sino-Soviet friendship and love Chairman Mao. When I was beaten to the ground, some Soviets shouted nearby, 'Fascists! Don't beat people!'"

Yan Xingshan said: "The blood we shed in Red Square will not be in vain. It exposes the ugly face of Soviet revisionism and also educates the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist clique beat us when we were reading Chairman Mao's quotations and singing 'The Internationale,' which shows they fear Marxism-Leninism, fear Mao Zedong Thought, fear 'The Internationale,' and fear revolution."

Liu Guanghui said: "The telegram of concern from Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi on behalf of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao is the greatest care and encouragement for us. The revisionists can injure our bodies, but they cannot shake our firm will to resist imperialism and revisionism. This blood debt, the Chinese people will surely settle. He excitedly said, "Dear Chairman Mao, we will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions, resolutely rebelling against imperialism and revisionism."

Jin Xianxiao, whose eyes were injured by Soviet revisionist fascist thugs, said: "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought has given us boundless strength. The fascist thugs can injure my eyes and beat my waist, but this only makes me more hate revisionism and more love Mao Zedong Thought, further promoting my ideological revolutionization."

Huang Jian, whose ribs were kicked and broken by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents, said with great emotion: "The most, most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao, when I heard the telegram of concern from Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi on behalf of you and Comrade Lin Biao, my blood boiled. Your teachings strongly inspire us to fight against the Soviet revisionist traitors. The revisionists can punch my chest and kick my ribs, but they cannot shake our resolute determination to defend Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to the death."

Chen Lukuang angrily denounced the crimes of the Soviet revisionist thugs and said: "My head and waist were severely injured. Being beaten by revisionists is an honor. After recovering, I will definitely throw myself into the great proletarian cultural revolution to temper myself and fight."

Ma Wenpu said with great emotion: "The most, most respected Chairman Mao, I have so much to say to you. It is you who have given us the boundless strength to bravely fight against Soviet revisionist fascism. With your teachings, we fear neither heaven nor earth, neither ghosts nor gods. The Soviet revisionist clique beat us unarmed students who were paying respects at Lenin and Stalin's tombs, which nakedly exposes their traitorous nature. They are deathly afraid of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. But Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will surely defeat revisionism!"

Li Zhenchai said: "Hearing the telegram of concern from Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi on behalf of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, we feel from the bottom of our hearts that this is Chairman Mao's greatest care, encouragement, and support for us. The Soviet revisionist clique beat us when we were paying respects at Lenin's tomb, reading Chairman Mao's quotations, and singing 'The Internationale,' which only makes us more clearly recognize that their so-called 'Marxism-Leninism' is all lies, and this only makes us more determined to oppose revisionism."

Xie Xiahe angrily said: "The Soviet military police and plainclothes agents beat me to a bloody pulp in front of Lenin's tomb. This blood debt we will surely settle." He firmly said, "Chinese revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi's concern on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao has given us greater strength. We will surely carry the struggle against revisionism to the end. The Soviet revisionist leadership will not escape the fate of the Russian tsars, Hitler, Chiang Kai-shek, and Khrushchev."

　　身受重伤的九位英勇反修战士发出豪言壮语
　　永远听毛主席的话，坚决造帝修的反
    新华社莫斯科二十八日电　二十五日遭到苏联军警和便衣特务毒打、身受重伤的九名中国留欧学生，向新华社记者发表谈话时说，伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了他们反修的无穷力量和勇气，他们决心遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决把反对修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    身受重伤躺在病床上的陈福生同志，忍着伤痛对新华社记者说：“在遭到修正主义者毒打时，我高声朗读毛主席语录‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’心中只有一个‘敢’字。”他接着说：“我还亲眼看到，广大苏联人民是珍视中苏友好的，是热爱毛主席的。在我被打倒在地时，有的苏联人就在旁边高喊‘法西斯！不许打人！’”。
    阎兴山同志说：“我们在红场流的血不会白流，它暴露了苏联修正主义的丑恶面目，也教育了苏联人民。苏联修正主义集团在我们读毛主席语录和唱《国际歌》时毒打我们，这证明他们怕马克思列宁主义，怕毛泽东思想，怕《国际歌》，怕革命”。
    刘光辉同志说：“周恩来总理和陈毅副总理代表毛主席和林彪同志给我们的慰问电，对我们是最大的关心和鼓舞。修正主义者可以打伤我们的身体，但是丝毫也动摇不了我们坚强的反帝、反修的意志。这笔血债，中国人民是一定要清算的。”他激动地说：“敬爱的毛主席，我们要永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，坚决造帝国主义和修正主义的反。”
    被苏联修正主义法西斯暴徒打坏眼睛的金先孝同志说：“毛泽东思想的光辉给了我们无穷的力量。法西斯暴徒们可以打坏我的眼睛、打伤我的腰，但这只能使我更加仇恨修正主义和更加热爱毛泽东思想，更加促进我的思想革命化。”
    被苏联军警和便衣特务踢断肋骨的黄建同同志万分激动地说：“最最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，当我听到周恩来总理和陈毅副总理代表您老人家和林彪同志发来的慰问电时，我的热血沸腾了。您老人家的教导强有力地鼓舞我们去和苏修叛徒进行斗争。修正主义者可以拳击我的胸口，踢断我的肋骨，但不能动摇我们誓死保卫马克思列宁主义，保卫毛泽东思想的坚强决心”。
    陈履奎同志愤怒地控诉了苏联修正主义暴徒的罪行之后说：“我的头部和腰部被打受重伤。我挨修正主义的打，这是光荣的。伤愈后，我一定投身到文化大革命的洪流中去锻炼和斗争。”
    马文普同志满怀激情地说：“最最敬爱的毛主席呀，我有满腹的话要对您说，是您给了我们同苏修法西斯进行英勇斗争的无穷力量。有了您的教导，我们就天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，神不怕。苏修集团毒打我们手无寸铁的向列宁和斯大林墓献花圈的学生，这就赤裸裸地暴露了他们的叛徒本质。他们对马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想怕得要死。但是，马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想必然要战胜修正主义！”
    李振才同志说：“听到周恩来总理和陈毅副总理代表毛主席和林彪同志给我们的慰问电，我们从内心里感到这是毛主席对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞和最大支持。苏联修正主义集团在我们向列宁陵墓献花圈和读毛主席语录、唱《国际歌》时毒打我们，这只能使我们更清楚地认识到，他们口中所说的‘马克思列宁主义’完全是骗人的，这只能更加坚定我们反对修正主义的决心”。谢燮禾同志愤怒地说：“苏修军警和便衣特务在列宁墓前把我打得血流满面。这笔血债我们是一定要清算的。”他最后坚定地说，“用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国革命青年是不可侮的。周恩来总理和陈毅副总理代表我们伟大的领袖毛主席和林彪同志对我们的慰问，给了我们更大的力量，我们一定要把反修斗争进行到底。苏修领导集团决逃不掉俄国沙皇、希特勒、蒋介石和赫鲁晓夫的命运”。
