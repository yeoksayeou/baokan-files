As Comrade Baluku and his delegation stepped out of the plane, Kang Sheng, Ye Jianying, Xiao Hua, and Yang Chengwu greeted them warmly, embracing and shaking hands. Comrade Baluku asked Comrade Kang Sheng to convey his most sincere and revolutionary greetings from Comrade Enver Hoxha to Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Lin Biao.

Xinhua News Agency, January 11th: Ye Jianying, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council, hosted a grand banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Albanian military delegation led by Bekir Baluku, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Minister of Defense, and Hito Chako, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army.

At the banquet, filled with fraternal and combative camaraderie, Comrade Kang Sheng and Comrade Ye Jianying presented red armbands to Comrade Baluku and Comrade Chako.

Comrade Ye Jianying said at the banquet, "Heroic socialist Albania, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party, firmly upholds the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism and stands tall in Europe amidst the dying struggles of imperialism and the rampant tide of revisionism. It represents the hope of millions of Europeans and symbolizes the future of Europe. As our great leader Chairman Mao said, you are mountains towering into the clouds, you are fearless proletarian revolutionaries who dare to fight against imperialism and its lackeys, dare to fight against all enemies of the world, you are a great beacon of socialism in Europe."

Comrade Bekir Baluku said in his speech, "Mao Zedong Thought is a shining example of revolutionary Marxism-Leninism. The great thought of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong is the red light guiding the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution conducted on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is a great example that all Marxist-Leninists in the world can and should learn from. Now, imperialists and modern revisionists are attacking and slandering the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Mao Zedong like mad beasts. Comrade Baluku pointed out, the imperialists' and revisionists' great chorus of attacks and slander clearly proves that the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is correct; it hits the target and is well executed. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has gained the deep sympathy and full support of all revolutionary and progressive forces in the world."

Those who attended today's banquet included Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Peng Shaohui, Li Tianyou, and Wang Xinting, Deputy Director of the General Political Department Xu Licheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua, President of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade Chu Tuonan, and leaders from various departments, branches, and forces of the PLA and the Beijing Garrison. Albanian Ambassador to China Vasili Nataneli and military attachés from various countries in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

Comrade Ye Jianying spoke first at the banquet. He, on behalf of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, and all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended the most cordial greetings and combat salutes to Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and a close friend of the Chinese people, to the fraternal Albanian people and the soldiers of the Albanian People's Army! He said, the heroic Albanian people and the Albanian People's Army, with their glorious revolutionary and combat traditions, have deeply inspired us in their struggles against domestic and foreign class enemies and in their great socialist revolution and socialist construction. You have raised the banner against imperialism led by the United States and the banner against modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership, supporting the struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world, greatly inspiring the revolutionary peoples of the world. Especially in recent years, the Albanian Labor Party has taken a series of revolutionary measures in the political, economic, military, and cultural fields, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and greatly promoting the development of socialist revolution and construction. Comrade Ye Jianying said, the Albanian People's Army has resolutely implemented the instructions of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, restored the party committee system, re-established the political commissar system, abolished military ranks, and further maintained and carried forward the glorious traditions of the people's army. The political tasks and the magnificent Fourth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy and culture proposed by the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party have opened up a more brilliant future for socialist Albania, pushing the socialist revolution and construction of Albania to a new high. The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people, with their revolutionary spirit of fighting bravely, self-reliance, hard work, fearlessness of difficulties, and fearlessness of violence, overcoming all difficulties, and defeating all enemies, have set a brilliant example for all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people in the world.

Comrade Ye Jianying said in discussing our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, "The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest event of the 1960s. This revolution has opened a new era in the history of the international communist movement. In this cultural revolution, the great, invincible, and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized, greatly promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and has become a powerful driving force for the development of our country's socialist production. Countless facts have once again proven that Mao Zedong Thought is the source of all our victories."

Comrade Ye Jianying enthusiastically praised the combat friendship established between the two parties, the two countries, and the armies of China and Albania in their struggles against our common enemies and in their struggles for the cause of socialism and communism. He said, this is the friendship of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, the greatest friendship in the world. This revolutionary combat friendship, which has withstood the test of storms and tempests, will be passed down for thousands of generations. Its great brilliance will forever shine upon the world.

Comrade Baluku said in his speech, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Labor Party, the government, and the leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to extend the most enthusiastic revolutionary greetings to the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the great leader of the Chinese people and a close friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong. He said, your country, under the guidance of the Communist Party of China and Mao Zedong Thought, has, for the past seventeen years, firmly and bravely stood at the forefront of the struggle, raising the banner of revolution and engaging in a head-on struggle against imperialism led by the United States and its agents—the modern revisionists led by the traitorous leadership of the CPSU.

Comrade Baluku enthusiastically praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, saying, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new stage of deeper and broader development of the socialist revolution in China. This revolution is uprooting all possibilities of the emergence of revisionism and capitalist restoration in China, ensuring the thorough victory of socialism in your country. He said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and promote proletarian democracy. Our party regards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as a further development of the theory and practice of building and defending socialism, enriching the experience of the international communist revolution."

Comrade Baluku said, "Comrade Mao Zedong's historic telegram to our party's Fifth Congress highly praised the fighting, revolutionary, and eternal friendship between our two peoples. He said, the Albanian people and the Labor Party are proud to march side by side with the great Chinese people and the glorious Communist Party of China. Our two countries' friendly cooperation will be further consolidated and strengthened."

On January 11th, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Jiang Qing, and other leaders watched the performance of the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble. After the performance, Comrade Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, and Jiang Qing went on stage to take a group photo with the performers, congratulating them on the successful performance.

The Albanian military delegation arrived in Beijing on January 11th. The photo shows the guests, accompanied by Comrade Kang Sheng and Comrade Ye Jianying, walking around the field to meet with the soldiers and militiamen from the army, navy, and air force who came to the airport to welcome them.
