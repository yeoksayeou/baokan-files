Albanian "People's Voice" editorial points out: Last year was a year of further victories for the revolutionary people of the whole world, a year in which imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries suffered repeated defeats.

After recounting the great victories achieved by the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, particularly the Vietnamese people, in 1966, the article states: Many facts clearly show that U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism have directed their main blows at the People's Republic of China because the people of China have disrupted their plans to dominate the world, exposed their collusion, and carried out activities to sabotage the freedom and independence of the peoples of various countries; because the people of China have become the strongest defender of the world revolution and the socialist cause, as well as the security of Asia and the world.

The article says: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong at its helm, the Chinese people have continuously strengthened their national defense. China's successful launch of a missile nuclear weapon in October last year and the recent successful nuclear test are heavy blows to the U.S. and Soviet attempts to monopolize nuclear weapons. This is a new great victory for the Chinese people and all anti-imperialist forces.

The article says: Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, China is successfully carrying out an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. This is a great event for the Chinese people and all revolutionary people of the world. The purpose of this cultural revolution is to permanently block the road to revisionism and capitalist restoration in China, ensuring that the socialist revolution achieves thorough victory in China.

The article says: In 1966, the Albanian people traversed a path filled with struggle and victory. Albania has become even stronger and more prosperous, turning into a steel fortress of socialism on the Adriatic coast and a steadfast warrior on the front lines against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism. The Albanian people are determined, under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour with Comrade Enver Hoxha at its helm, to confidently achieve new victories in socialist construction.

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》编辑部文章指出
    去年是世界革命人民胜利的一年
    中国已经成为世界革命最强大的保卫者
    新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》一日发表编辑部文章指出，一九六六年是全世界革命人民进一步获得胜利的一年，是帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派一再遭到失败的一年。
    文章在叙述了亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民，特别是越南人民，在一九六六年中所取得的伟大胜利后说，许多事实清楚地表明：美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义把他们的主要打击矛头指向了中华人民共和国，因为人民中国打乱了他们主宰世界的计划，揭露了他们狼狈为奸，进行破坏各国人民自由和独立的阴谋活动；因为人民中国已经成为世界革命和社会主义事业、亚洲和世界安全的最强大的保卫者。
    文章说，在以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下，中国人民不断地增强了国防力量。中国去年十月导弹核武器发射成功以及最近又成功地进行了一次新的核爆炸，是对美苏妄图垄断核武器的沉重打击。这是中国人民和所有反帝力量的新的伟大胜利。
    文章说，在中国共产党和光辉的毛泽东思想的领导下，中国正在顺利进行着史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。这是中国人民和全世界革命人民的一个伟大事件。这场文化大革命的目的是为了永远堵塞在中国产生修正主义和资本主义复辟的道路，使社会主义革命在中国取得彻底胜利。
    文章说，一九六六年，阿尔巴尼亚人民走过了一段充满战斗和胜利的道路。阿尔巴尼亚变得更加富强，已经成为亚得里亚海岸社会主义的钢铁般的堡垒和站在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和现代修正主义前线的坚强战士。阿尔巴尼亚人民决心在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，满怀信心地夺取社会主义建设事业的新的胜利。
