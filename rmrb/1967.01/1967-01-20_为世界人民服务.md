In the scorching deserts and jungles of Africa, there are batches of Chinese medical workers. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings, learn from the example of Norman Bethune, overcome all difficulties, rescue the injured, and treat the sick, wholeheartedly serving the African brothers and sisters.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have won victory in their revolution should help the people who are still struggling for liberation. This is our internationalist duty."

The Chinese medical personnel who are dedicated to serving the African people are indeed internationalist warriors trained by Chairman Mao's teachings. They consider the sufferings of the African people as their own, and they regard the joys of the African people as their own. They have a deep class sentiment for the African working people, and their hearts are connected with the hearts of the African people. Because of this, they have won the love of the African people and are praised by the African people as good doctors sent by Chairman Mao.

The Chinese revolution is a part of the world revolution. The interests of the Chinese people are consistent with the interests of the world's people. Chairman Mao calls on us to serve all the people of China and the world. We must have a broad vision for our country, look at the world, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and strive to make contributions to the world revolution.

    为世界人民服务
    在非洲炎热的沙漠和丛林中，有一批批的中国白衣战士。他们按照毛主席的教导，学习白求恩的榜样，排除万难，救死扶伤，全心全意地为非洲兄弟姐妹们服务。
    毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”
    热心为非洲人民服务的中国医务人员，正是毛主席教导出来的国际主义战士。他们把非洲人民的痛苦当成自己的痛苦，把非洲人民的欢乐当成自己的欢乐。他们对非洲劳动人民怀有强烈的阶级感情，他们的心是和非洲人民的心连在一起的。正因为这样，他们赢得了非洲人民的热爱，被非洲人民誉为毛主席派来的好医生。
    中国革命是世界革命的一部分。中国人民的利益同世界人民的利益是一致的。毛主席号召我们要为全中国和全世界的人民服务。我们必须胸怀祖国，放眼世界，用毛泽东思想武装起来，为世界革命努力作出贡献。
