The congratulatory telegram from the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel groups in Shanghai has struck a chord in our hearts. Reading this telegram, our direction is clearer and our eyes are brighter. It has given us revolutionary rebels support and inspired us to achieve new victories. We are filled with boundless energy. We want to shout: Long live, long, long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!

After several months of struggle, the strength of the revolutionary rebel workers in our factory has grown increasingly powerful. A small number of diehards in our factory who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have played many tricks to suppress our revolutionary movement and sabotage production, but their plots have been exposed and foiled one by one by us revolutionary rebel workers. Finally, they resorted to passive resistance to oppose the Cultural Revolution, thinking that they were the leaders and organizers of production, and that without them, production could not be carried out.

Last year, the state entrusted our factory with the trial production of an important product—electroplated pipes. As November was about to end, a small clique in the factory who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line loudly proclaimed "grasp revolution, promote production," but at this critical moment, they incited a group of workers to leave their production posts. We revolutionary rebel workers, on the one hand, persistently criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, and on the other hand, held fast to our production posts. To trial-produce this important product, several of us young apprentices who were looked down upon immediately organized a "breakthrough team." Following Chairman Mao's teaching to dare to tread paths where no one has gone before, we put "dare" at the forefront and boldly broke through the Soviet revisionist framework, changing the "blow-plating" process in the past operating procedures to "suction-plating." Without experimental tools, we made them ourselves using scrap materials, and finally succeeded in the trial production. After inspection, this important product fully met the national standards. Even those technical "authorities" had to admit that this reform opened up a new path for the production of similar products in the future.

To complete this national production plan in the shortest possible time, we revolutionary rebel workers seized the production leadership of the workshop, united the majority of workers, and organized a production assault team to direct production ourselves. In those tense days, everyone worked day and night without rest. Our hearts were in the workshop, we worked in the workshop, ate in the workshop, and slept in the workshop. Some comrades, despite being ill, still insisted on the production assault. When everyone was tired from working, we would loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, not fearing sacrifice, not fearing fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings gave us boundless strength. We finally overcame numerous difficulties and successfully completed the national production task ahead of schedule on December 29, with the product quality reaching a high standard.

We revolutionary rebel workers listen most to Chairman Mao's words. Through this period of struggle, we have come to understand a truth more clearly: putting the leadership of revolution and production in the hands of us revolutionary rebels, we can indeed shoulder the double burden of revolution and production. In the future, we will definitely better implement Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," and together with the revolutionary rebels throughout the factory and the country, use actual actions to smash the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

### 一面坚持革命斗争  一面坚守生产岗位

    一面坚持革命斗争  一面坚守生产岗位
    党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电，字字句句都说到了我们的心坎里。读了这个贺电，我们方向更明、眼睛更亮了，它给我们革命造反派工人撑了腰，鼓舞着我们去夺取新的胜利。我们浑身顿时增长了使不完的干劲。我们要放声欢呼：我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁，万万岁！
    经过几个月的较量，我们厂的革命造反派工人的力量，越来越壮大了。我厂极少数顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，他们耍了不少花招来压制我厂的革命运动，破坏生产，但他们的阴谋一个一个被我们革命造反派工人识破、戳穿了。最后，他们就用消极怠工来对抗文化大革命运动，他们满以为他们是生产的领导者、组织者，离开了他们，生产就搞不成。
    去年，国家交给我厂试制和生产一项重要产品——电镀管道。眼看十一月份快过去了，厂内一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，口口声声要“抓革命，促生产”，却在这关键时刻，挑动一批工人脱离生产岗位。我们革命造反派工人，一方面坚持批判资产阶级反动路线，一方面坚守生产岗位。为了试制这项重要产品，我们几个被看不起的青年徒工，立即组织了一个“攻关小组”。大家遵循毛主席敢于走前人没走过的道路的教导，敢字当头，大胆地突破了苏修那一套洋框框，把过去工艺操作规程中的“吹镀”改成“抽镀”，没有试验的工具，我们就利用废料自己做，终于试制成功了。经过鉴定，这项重要产品完全符合国家规定的标准。就连那些技术“权威”也不得不承认，实现这项改革为今后同类产品的生产开辟出一条新的路子。
    为了在极短的时间内突击完成这一项产品的国家计划，我们革命造反派工人夺过了车间生产领导权，团结多数工人，组织了生产突击队，自己指挥生产。在那紧张的日子里，大家不分白天黑夜地干。我们心在车间，干在车间，吃在车间，睡在车间。有的同志带病仍然坚持突击生产。当大家干得疲倦的时候，就高声朗读毛主席语录：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”毛主席的亲切教导给我们增添了无穷的力量。我们终于克服了重重困难，提前在十二月二十九日胜利地完成了国家交付的生产任务，产品质量达到了高标准。
    我们革命造反派工人最听毛主席的话。通过这一段斗争，我们更加认清了一个道理：把革命和生产领导权掌握在我们革命造反派手里，我们完全能挑起革命和生产两副重担子。我们今后一定要更好地执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，同全厂、全国的革命造反派一道，用实际行动来粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
