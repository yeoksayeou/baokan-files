Some progressive figures from several Asian and African countries have recently expressed enthusiastic praise for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, saying it is a powerful support for the oppressed peoples of the world.

The Chairman of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association, Alahakone, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will eliminate the influence of the old culture of the exploiting classes, create a new culture suitable for the socialist economy, and thus eliminate the possibility of a restoration of the exploiting classes in China.

The Secretary-General of the Ceylon-China Friendship Association, Ananda Kumara, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is unprecedented in history. He pointed out that this cultural revolution will leave no room for the old ideology of the exploiting classes in China, ensuring that China remains a socialist country and continues to advance towards a communist society.

A Nepalese friend named Bahadur said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led by the great leader Chairman Mao, is making great strides forward. It greatly encourages the struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism.

A Burmese architect, U Kyaw Min, said: The Chinese people are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We support and cheer for the great revolution being carried out by the daring Chinese people.

He said that the experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has enriched the experience of the international proletariat. This great revolution is "the product of the greatest genius, Mao Zedong's thought. Mao Zedong Thought has given the world's proletarian revolutionaries the most effective weapon to overthrow imperialism and capitalism. The great helmsman of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, has become the most outstanding great leader of the international proletariat."

U Kyaw Min said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will definitely be victorious. He concluded with a passionate shout: "Long live the Chinese people! The great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will fly high! Long live Chairman Mao!"

A Syrian friend praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, saying it has "great significance." He said, "The result of China's Cultural Revolution will make China further advance along the socialist path to victory, which is a powerful support for the oppressed peoples of the world and the highest form of internationalism."

This Syrian friend enthusiastically praised the Red Guards in China as "the vanguard of the cultural revolution," and said, "Imperialism hopes that the new generation in China will change, but the new generation in China, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, is advancing the Chinese revolution, and with their actual actions, they have shattered the illusions of imperialism. I salute the Red Guards!"

A Palestinian revolutionary fighter once said in Cairo to a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a major event in the world today. The Cultural Revolution in China shows that Chairman Mao Zedong has unlimited trust in the people. Undoubtedly, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people will make great strides forward on the revolutionary road. I have not seen the Cultural Revolution in China, but from the frenzied attacks of the imperialists on it, I can completely determine that the Cultural Revolution in China must be a very good thing. As Chairman Mao told us, 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' Now, U.S. imperialism regards China as its number one enemy, but in fact, China is our best friend because it has always stood firmly on the side of the revolutionary peoples of the world."

A member of the Botswana People's Party National Executive Committee, Bobbie Mark, recently said in Cairo to a reporter from Xinhua News Agency: "The purpose of this cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is to uproot the roots of capitalist restoration and push the socialist revolution in China to final victory. 'The Cultural Revolution in China is not only related to the future of China but also to the future of the world.'"

    亚非国家朋友热烈赞扬我国文化大革命
    毛主席领导中国人民在革命道路上奋勇前进
    据新华社讯　一些亚非国家的进步人士最近热情赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命“是对全世界被压迫人民强有力的支持”。
    锡中友协主席阿拉季亚瓦纳说，中国无产阶级文化大革命将破除剥削阶级旧文化的影响，创造适合于社会主义经济的新文化，从而消除剥削阶级在中国实行复辟的可能性。
    锡中友协秘书长阿南达·库马拉说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的。他指出，这场文化大革命，将使剥削阶级的旧思想在中国没有立足的余地，使中国保持社会主义国家的本色，并进一步走向共产主义社会。
    一个名叫巴哈杜尔的尼泊尔朋友说，由伟大的领袖毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命正在大踏步前进。它大大鼓舞了全世界人民反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争。
    缅甸建筑师吴觉敏说：中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，正在开展无产阶级文化大革命，我们拥护并欢呼敢于革命的中国人民进行的这场伟大的革命。
    他说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命的经验丰富了国际无产阶级的经验。这场大革命是“最伟大的天才毛泽东的思想的产物。毛泽东思想使世界无产阶级革命者有了推翻帝国主义和资本主义的最有效的武器。中国人民的伟大舵手毛主席成了国际无产者的最杰出的伟大领袖。”
    吴觉敏说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命一定会胜利。他最后热情高呼：“中国人民万岁！”“毛泽东思想的伟大红旗将高高飘扬！”“毛主席万岁！”
    一位叙利亚朋友赞扬毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命“具有非常重大的意义”。他说：“中国进行文化大革命的结果，将使中国进一步沿着社会主义道路胜利前进，这是对全世界被压迫人民强有力的支持，是最高的国际主义。”
    这位叙利亚朋友热情赞扬中国的红卫兵“是文化革命的先锋”，并且说，“帝国主义幻想中国新的一代变颜色，但是中国新的一代正在毛泽东主席领导下把中国革命推向前进，他们以实际行动，粉碎了帝国主义的幻想。我向红卫兵致敬！”
    一位巴勒斯坦革命战士有一次在开罗同新华社记者发表谈话时说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命“是当前世界上的一件大事。中国的文化大革命表明，毛泽东主席无限信任人民。毫无疑问，在毛主席的正确领导下，中国人民将在革命的道路上大踏步奋勇前进。我没有看到中国的文化大革命，但是从帝国主义者对它的疯狂攻击来看，我完全可以断定，中国的文化大革命一定是极好的事情。正如毛主席告诉我们的，‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’现在美帝国主义把中国当作它的头号敌人，但是实际上中国是我们的最好的朋友，因为它始终坚定地站在世界革命人民一边。”
    贝专纳人民党全国执行委员会委员波比·马克最近在开罗对新华社记者说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场文化革命，目的是要挖掉资本主义复辟的根子，把中国的社会主义革命推向最后胜利。”“中国文化大革命不仅关系中国的未来，而且关系世界的未来。”
