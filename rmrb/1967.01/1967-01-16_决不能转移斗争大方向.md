At a time when the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victories and a new high tide of the Cultural Revolution is sweeping through industrial and mining enterprises, some serious issues have emerged in our factory. A small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have suddenly changed their tune, pretending to "care for" and "support" the masses' rebellion. They are vigorously inciting second-grade workers to demand promotions, young trainees to demand back pay, female workers to demand welfare, cafeteria workers to demand subsidies, and even inciting the masses to "rebel" against work uniforms, rubber shoes, and collective dormitories, among other things. The list goes on and on.

Are they truly supporting the revolutionary masses' rebellion? Absolutely not. They are playing tricks and plotting conspiracies.

The nature of the class enemy does not change. They are not willing to accept their own demise. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and all reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, they are very powerful, but in reality, they are not so powerful. It is people, not things, that determine the face of the earth. The 'paper tigers' appear terrifying, but in fact, they are not powerful. The revolutionary people have strong belief, dauntless courage, and a deep sense of responsibility, and they are not afraid of the tricks and fraud of the imperialists and reactionaries. They are as brave as tigers."

Workers who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought immediately see through the tricks of a small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road.

They are trying to use "sugar-coated bullets" to attack us workers, using economic bribery to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, leading political struggles down the path of economism, diverting the main direction of the struggle, and thus protecting themselves, protecting the bourgeois reactionary line, and protecting the old order of capitalism and revisionism.

They squander state and collective property recklessly, attempting to undermine the foundations of the socialist economy. Once production is disrupted, they will blame the revolutionary rebels, sabotaging the Cultural Revolution.

They attempt to use economism to deceive and mislead some who are unaware of the truth, to confuse class lines, blur the distinction between revolutionary factions and diehards, and disintegrate the ranks of the revolutionary left.

They attempt to use the revisionist material incentives and "money as the commander" to oppose Mao Zedong Thought as the commander and political command, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism.

In short, they are making a desperate struggle, picking up the old revisionist rags that have been discarded by the masses, launching a new counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary line, and a new counterattack against the broad revolutionary masses. Their methods are so vicious!

All of us workers must keep our eyes wide open and be highly vigilant. We must not fall for the tricks of those reactionaries. Revolutionary workers deeply understand that to thoroughly smash the old, unreasonable system, we must first rebel politically. Because only by shattering the bourgeois reactionary line and overthrowing those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the party, can our country advance along the path of socialism and communism, and only then can the broad revolutionary staff be truly liberated. What is the point of pursuing economic benefits and small favors? If we do not engage in a head-on struggle with those in power who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, if we do not expose their new conspiracies in a timely manner, the Cultural Revolution will be aborted, and the counter-revolutionary revisionists will once again ride roughshod over us, and China will change color. Can we allow this to happen? No, we cannot!

Only by uprooting revisionism can we thoroughly reform the old, unreasonable system. We must resolutely oppose economism and smash the conspiracy of the bourgeois reactionary line to divert political struggles into economism.

    决不能转移斗争大方向
    第一机床厂铸工红旗　群力
    正当以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性的胜利，工矿企业掀起无产阶级文化大革命新高潮的时候，我们厂里出现了一些值得注意的严重问题。一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，突然一反常态，装出一副“关心”和“支持”群众造反的模样。他们极力鼓动老二级工人要求升级，青年学员要求补发工资，女工要求福利，炊事员要求补贴，甚至鼓动群众“造”工作服的“反”、胶皮鞋的“反”、集体宿舍的“反”，等等，真是五花八门。
    难道他们是真的支持革命群众造反吗？绝对不是。他们在耍花招，搞阴谋。
    阶级敌人的本性是不会改变的，他们决不甘心自己的灭亡。毛主席教导我们说：帝国主义和一切反动派“决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派工人一眼就看穿了一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的鬼花招。
    他们就是要用“糖衣炮弹”来打我们工人群众，用经济收买的手段，来腐蚀群众的革命意志，把群众的政治斗争引向经济主义的歧途，转移斗争的大方向，借以保护他们自己，保护资产阶级反动路线，保护资本主义、修正主义的旧秩序。
    他们慷国家之慨，肆意挥霍国家和集体的财产，妄图挖社会主义经济的墙脚，一旦把生产搞坏了，就把责任推在造反派的头上，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
    他们妄图用经济主义，欺骗和蒙蔽一部分不明真相的人，搅乱阶级阵线，混淆革命派和顽固派的界限，瓦解无产阶级革命左派队伍。
    他们妄图用修正主义的物质刺激、“钞票挂帅”来对抗毛泽东思想挂帅、政治挂帅，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。
    总之，他们进行垂死挣扎，拾起那一套早被群众抛弃的修正主义破烂，向无产阶级革命路线进行新反扑，向广大革命群众进行新反扑。他们的手段何其毒也！
    我们全体工人，必须擦亮眼睛，百倍警惕，千万不能上那些反动家伙的当。革命的工人深深地懂得，要彻底砸烂不合理的旧制度，必须首先在政治上造反。因为只有粉碎了资产阶级反动路线，打倒了党内走资本主义道路的当权派，使我们国家沿着社会主义、共产主义的道路向前发展，广大革命职工才能得到彻底解放。搞什么经济福利，搞什么小恩小惠，不去和走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子作针锋相对的斗争，不及时揭露他们的新阴谋，文化大革命就会夭折，反革命修正主义分子就会重新骑在我们的头上，中国就会改变颜色。我们能答应这样干吗？不能，决不能！
    只有挖掉修正主义的根子，才能彻底改革不合理的旧制度。我们要坚决反对经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线把政治斗争引向经济主义的阴谋。
