    Carry Out Chairman Mao's Instructions Resolutely
    The members of Baofeng Commune in Wuhu, Anhui, have been diligently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, actively propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions. Last year, in the process of achieving a bumper harvest, the members relied on Mao Zedong Thought to solve various ideological problems.

    Last spring, during the preparation for farming, some people were content with the status quo, saying, "We exceeded the quota last year, so we won't fall short this year." Everyone brought this ideological problem to the study of articles such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "Put Down Your Burdens and Open Your Hearts," as well as aphorisms like "Modesty helps one go forward, while conceit makes one lag behind." They overcame the ideas of arrogance, self-satisfaction, and stagnation, and actively carried out the preparatory work centered on expanding the area of double-cropping rice, eventually increasing the area of double-cropping rice to about 70% of the total arable land.

    After the early rice was sown, they encountered prolonged low temperatures, rainy weather, and cold waves, leading to the rotting of seedlings and seeds. Some cadres and commune members became pessimistic. They then studied "Moving Mountains" and the aphorism, "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our spirits." They displayed revolutionary spirit, took various measures, overcame the cold waves and low temperatures, and finally completed the early rice transplanting tasks on time and to the required quality, achieving a good harvest.

    During the rush to harvest early rice and transplant double-cropping late rice, they encountered extremely hot weather, and some people developed a sense of dread. The broad masses of commune members studied the following aphorisms from Chairman Mao: "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." "Promote the spirit of daring to fight, fearing no sacrifice, fearing no fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." "All mentalities in the cadres that rely on unexpected convenience and luck to win without personal hard struggle, blood, and sweat must be completely eliminated." After studying, everyone raised their ideological awareness, fearing neither the scorching heat nor the day or night, and launched the "double rush" activities. As a result, within five days after the "Autumn Equinox," they completed the early rice harvesting and double-cropping late rice transplanting tasks to a higher standard, with the area being more than double that of the same period last year.

### 坚决照毛主席的指示去办

专栏：大学毛主席著作  大立毛泽东思想

    坚决照毛主席的指示去办
    安徽芜湖保丰公社的社员们，认真活学活用毛主席著作，积极宣传毛泽东思想，坚决照毛主席的指示办事。社员们去年在夺取大丰收的过程中，就是依靠毛泽东思想解决各种思想问题的。
    去年春天备耕时，有些人满足现状，说：“去年超纲要，今年差不了。”大家就带着这个思想问题，学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《放下包袱，开动机器》等文章和“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”等语录，克服了骄傲自满、故步自封的思想，积极开展了以扩大双季稻种植面积为中心的备耕活动，结果把双季稻种植面积扩大到占耕地总面积百分之七十左右。
    早稻播种以后，遇到长期低温阴雨天气和寒流袭击，发生了烂秧烂种现象，一部分干部、社员产生了消极悲观情绪。于是，他们又学习《愚公移山》和“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气”等语录，发扬了革命精神，采取各种措施，战胜寒流低温，终于不误农时、按质按量地完成早稻栽插任务，夺得了好收成。
    在抢收早稻和抢栽双季晚稻期间，遇到特别热的天气，有些人产生了畏难情绪。广大社员学习了以下几条毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”“干部中一切不经过自己艰苦奋斗、流血流汗，而依靠意外便利、侥幸取胜的心理，必须扫除干净。”经过学习，大家提高了思想觉悟，不畏酷暑炎热，不分白天夜晚，展开“双抢”活动。结果，在“立秋”后五天，就按高标准完成了面积比前年同期大一倍以上的早稻收割和双季晚稻栽插任务。
