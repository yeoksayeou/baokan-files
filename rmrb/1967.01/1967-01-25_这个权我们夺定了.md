	We will definitely seize this power!
	Beijing Mining Institute Dongfanghong Commune "Red Star" Combat Team

	“Ask the vast land, who controls the rise and fall?” We, we, are the revolutionary rebels! We dare to speak, dare to act, dare to rebel. We are heroes who stand tall and proud. All revolutionary power must be seized, and we will manage the revolutionary seals. For the past seventeen years since the founding of the nation, various powers in the Mining Institute have been usurped by some revisionists. If we do not seize this power today, when else should we do it? We must smash this revisionist Mining Institute to pieces, and let those revisionist "authorities" and all the monsters and demons go to hell!

	The revolutionary leftists of the Mining Institute have seized power. Seven proclamations are like seven powerful cannonballs, hitting the target accurately and striking hard. They have sentenced the revisionist Institute Party Committee and Institute Committee to death and delivered a devastating blow to this revisionist stronghold of the Mining Institute. Every revolutionary rebel is thrilled and excited, spreading the news. But there are also a few scoundrels and fools in the dark corners, barking endlessly:

	“You are promoting ‘splitism’!”
	“You are promoting ‘selfishness’!”
	“You are promoting ‘great power chauvinism’! ‘Old Party’!”
	“It is wrong to say that all power belongs to Dongfanghong! You are politically persecuting revolutionary organizations!”

	Pah! All these nonsense can go to hell! All these strange and absurd theories should stop! “In this small globe, a few flies hit the wall. Buzzing, a few wails, a few sobs.” The curses of the enemy and the howls of the mediocre cannot harm us in the slightest. Revolutionaries grow stronger in the midst of the enemy's opposition, and it is in the curses of those old masters that we grow up. The wheel of human history cannot be stopped by anyone, and victory will definitely belong to us revolutionary rebels.

	Revolutionary leftists unite! All power to the leftists!
	Down with sentimentalism! Down with compromise!
	Down with conciliation!
	Resolutely and thoroughly smash the old revisionist Mining Institute!
	Struggle to build a new Mining Institute based on Mao Zedong Thought!

　　这个权我们夺定了
　　北京矿业学院东方红公社“红星”战斗队
      “问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”我们，我们，就是我们革命造反派！我们敢说、敢干、敢造反，我们是顶天立地的英雄汉。革命的大权统统夺，革命的大印我们管。建国十七年来，矿院各种大权都被一些修正主义分子所窃取，这个权，我们今天不夺，更待何时？我们要把修正主义的矿院砸它个稀巴烂，让那些修正主义的老爷“权威”们，那些牛鬼蛇神统统见鬼去吧！
    矿院的革命左派夺权了。七个通告像七颗最有力的炮弹，射得准，打得狠。给修正主义的院党委、院委判了死刑，给矿院这块修正主义的阵地以毁灭性的轰击。每个革命造反派，无不为之欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告。但也有那么一小撮混蛋和糊涂虫们，在那阴暗角落里，狂吠不止：
    你们搞“分裂主义”！
    你们搞“利己主义”！
    你们搞“大国沙文主义”！“老子党”！
     “一切权力归东方红是错误的！你们对革命组织进行政治迫害！”
    呸！统统见他妈的鬼去吧。一切奇谈怪论可以休矣！“小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。”敌人的咒骂，庸人的狂叫，损害不了我们半根毫毛。革命者就是在敌人的反对声中壮大的，就是在那般老爷们的骂声中成长起来的。人类历史的车轮是谁也挡不住的，胜利是一定属于我们革命造反派的。
    革命左派联合起来！一切权力归左派！
    打倒温情主义！打倒折衷主义！
    打倒调和主义！
    坚决、彻底砸烂修正主义的旧矿院！
    为建立毛泽东思想的新矿院而奋斗！
