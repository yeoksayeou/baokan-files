What is the current characteristic of the situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution?

It is this: Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary rebels are uniting and seizing power from the capitalist roaders in power!

The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party are in a state of panic and chaos!

The stubborn elements who insist on the capitalist reactionary line are in a state of panic and disorder!

Along the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, throughout the country, there is a fervent atmosphere of big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, big connections, big propaganda, big rallies, big demonstrations, big distribution of leaflets, and big meetings. In a word, it is "chaos."

The revolutionary rebels are born, grow, and strengthen in the midst of "chaos"; the capitalist roaders within the Party are isolated and doomed in the midst of "chaos."

Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line is increasingly embraced by the people in the midst of "chaos"; the capitalist reactionary line, despite its changing forms, will ultimately be exposed by the broad masses.

"Chaos" is the development, change, and movement of things. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a major social upheaval under new historical conditions, and it must be chaotic.

"Chaos" is the key, and order lies within. This "chaos" is the disruption of the old capitalist order; this order is the establishment of the new socialist order. Without this "chaos," there would be no destruction of the old capitalist order, and there would be no establishment of the new socialist order. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a rebellion and destruction of the old capitalist order and must be chaotic. "Chaos" is a transitional process from old things to new things. Old things are eliminated in the midst of "chaos," and new things are born in the midst of "chaos." "Chaos" is the midwife of all new things. New things must emerge from old things and must go through "chaos."

"Chaos" is the "grand festival" of the broad masses advancing with history. "Chaos" breaks the various shackles of the old order on the broad masses, giving the broad masses the greatest possible liberation. The boundless creativity and brilliant wisdom of the people are fully unleashed in this "chaos."

Some people, standing outside the mass movement, do not enjoy the joy of a "grand festival" in the midst of "chaos." Some people do not look at this "chaos" from the dialectical development of things. They do not see how much old and rotten things are destroyed in this "chaos," nor do they see how many new and lively things are emerging and sprouting from the ground. They do not enthusiastically support the destruction of old things and the birth of new things, but instead cling to old things with reluctance, lamenting the demise of old things. Toward the growth of new things, they either do not see them at all, or they use a magnifying glass to look at the inevitable dirt on the new things that have just emerged from the soil in the midst of "chaos." They criticize excessively, complain inappropriately, worry endlessly, and impose countless rules and regulations (Mao Zedong, "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization"). In this way, they cannot affirm the "chaos." Unknowingly, these people will not even be able to affirm themselves and will eventually be buried with the old world that is bound to die. "Chaos" is the day of mourning for those who are content with the status quo and defenders of the old world. Revolutionary "chaos" is very good. Because this "chaos" aims to destroy the old world and create a new world, to promote the development of social history, and is a leap in social history.

Revolutionary "chaos" is very good; revolution is about "chaos"; without "chaos," there is no revolution.

"By the wrecked boat, a thousand sails pass by; before the withered tree, ten thousand blossoms bloom."

Let the old world die in the midst of "chaos," and let the new world be born in the midst of "chaos"!

All revolutionary rebel comrades, raise your hands to welcome this great revolutionary "chaos"! A fiery new world will surely be born in the midst of "chaos"!

　　论“乱”
　　浙江工农兵美术大学附中　《红太阳》报评论员
    当前无产阶级文化大革命的形势特点是什么？
    这就是：在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下革命造反派大联合，向走资本主义道路的当权派展开无产阶级大夺权！
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派诚惶诚恐、乱了营！
    坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子慌了神、乱了阵脚！
    黄河两岸、大江南北，全国热气腾腾，大鸣，大放，大字报，大辩论，大串连，大宣传，大鼓动，大游行，大集会，大发传单，大张旗鼓，一片大动荡。
    一言以蔽之，就是“乱”。
    无产阶级革命造反派在“乱”中产生、发展、壮大；党内走资本主义道路的当权派在“乱”中孤立、完蛋。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线在“乱”中不断深入人心；资产阶级反动路线在“乱”中尽管不断改变形式，但终究要为广大群众所识破。
      “乱”，就是事物的发展、变化、运动。无产阶级文化大革命是在新的历史条件下的一个大的社会变动，必然大
  “乱”。
      “乱”字当头，治在其中，不“乱”不治。这个“乱”，是对资本主义旧秩序的乱；这个治，是建立社会主义新秩序的治。没有这个“乱”，就没有资本主义旧秩序的破坏，也就没有社会主义新秩序的建立。无产阶级文化大革命是对资本主义旧秩序的造反、破坏，必须大“乱”，“乱”，是一种由旧事物转变到新事物的过渡。旧事物在“乱”中消灭，新事物在“乱”中诞生。“乱”，是一切新事物的产婆。新事物要从旧事物中脱胎出来，必须经过“乱”。
      “乱”，是同历史一道前进的广大群众的“盛大节日”。“乱”，冲破了旧秩序对广大群众的种种束缚，使广大群众获得了最大限度的解放。人民群众无穷无尽的创造力和光辉夺目的智慧就在这“乱”中最大限度地迸发出来。
    有一些人，置身于群众运动之外，他们根本就享受不到在“乱”中的“盛大节日”般的欢乐。有一些人，不是从事物的发展的辩证法中去看这个“乱”，他们看不到在这个“乱”中有多少陈旧和腐朽的东西被破坏，他们也看不到无数新鲜活泼的东西在显露头角和从地底下倔强地萌芽出来；他们不是热烈地去拥护旧事物的破坏和新事物的诞生，而是始终对旧事物抱着难舍难分的留恋态度，为旧事物的消灭喊冤叫屈；而对新事物的成长，则一概看不见，或者是用放大镜去看这个在“乱”中刚从泥土中生长出来的新事物身上的不可避免的污垢，“过多的评头品足，不适当的埋怨，无穷的忧虑，数不尽的清规戒律”（毛主席《关于农业合作化问题》），以此来看待革命的群众运动，看待“乱”中成长的新事物，看待“乱”中必然存在的缺陷，那末，当然就没有法子肯定这个“乱”字了。岂知这样下去，这些人连自己都会没法肯定，结果只有随同必然死亡的旧世界一块被埋葬。“乱”，是安分守己者和旧世界的保卫者的丧日。革命的“乱”就是好得很。因为这个“乱”是旨在破坏旧世界、创造新世界，是旨在推动社会历史的发展，是社会历史的一个飞跃。
    革命的“乱”就是好得很，革命就是要“乱”；没有“乱”，就没有革命。
      “沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春。”
      “乱”吧，让旧世界在“乱”中死亡，让新世界在“乱”中诞生！
    一切革命造反派的同志们，举起你的双手，去迎接这场革命的大“乱”吧！一个火红火红的新世界必将在“乱”中诞生！
