The memorandum of talks between representatives of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association and the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) points out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great contribution to the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. A small handful of people, in collusion with the American imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, and Japanese reactionaries, have been vigorously engaging in anti-China activities, which only exposes their treacherous faces of betraying Sino-Japanese friendship.

New China News Agency, January 23rd: The memorandum of talks between representatives of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association and the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) was signed in Beijing on the 18th.

The memorandum states that recently, a small handful of people, while singing the praises of friendship, have in fact colluded with American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and Japanese reactionaries to engage in a grand anti-China chorus, thereby sabotaging the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. However, their despicable actions cannot harm the development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement; instead, they only further expose their treacherous faces of betraying the Sino-Japanese friendship cause.

The memorandum also points out that American imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, Soviet modern revisionism, and their old and new followers are terrified of Mao Zedong Thought and the great achievements of the Chinese people. They have colluded with each other to engage in a grand anti-China, anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and anti-Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution chorus. However, history will prove that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led by the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly achieve final victory, and their conspiracies will definitely fail.

The memorandum states that the representatives of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) have seen that the Chinese people are vigorously studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people. Under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, with the Red Guards as the vanguard and the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres as the main force, a more extensive, deeper, and more thorough, unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution is being carried out. They express their enthusiastic support for this. While the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is achieving victory nationwide, China has successfully conducted its fifth nuclear test and achieved a leap forward in all aspects of industry and agriculture, for which they express their congratulations. The representatives of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) believe that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the fundamental guarantee that the Chinese people will carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and it is a great contribution to the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and modern revisionism.

The memorandum states that the Chinese side reiterates its firm support for the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) and appreciates the initiative proposed by the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) at its meeting of standing committee members and active members in December 1966, which called for the further development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The Chinese side is pleased to see that people who truly promote Sino-Japanese friendship are rising up in various parts of Japan. This proves that the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) represents the aspirations of the broad masses of the Japanese people and enjoys the support of the broad masses of the Japanese people. The unity of the peoples of China and Japan is an irresistible historical trend.

The memorandum states that both sides first affirm that the statements issued by 32 prominent figures from various circles in Japan and 52 prominent figures from various circles in China in the autumn of 1966, and the joint statement issued by the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association and the Japan-China Friendship Association on October 12, 1966, are correct. In the new situation, they have become the basis for the development of the Sino-Japanese friendship movement.

The memorandum states that both sides express their firm support for the Vietnamese people in their struggle to drive out the last American aggressor from Vietnam.

The memorandum finally states that both sides have reached an agreement on friendly exchanges and cultural and economic exchanges for the year 1967, and they express their determination to jointly strive for a new stage in the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

Representatives of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, Liao Chengzhi and Zhao Anbo, and representatives of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox), Sanjo Kazuo and Kasuga Yoshikazu, signed the memorandum of talks.

　　中日友协和日中友协（正统）总部代表会谈纪要指出
　　中国文化大革命是对反帝反修斗争巨大贡献
　　一小撮人伙同美帝苏修日本反动派大肆反华，只能暴露背叛中日友好的丑恶面目
    新华社二十三日讯 中国日本友好协会代表和日本中国友好协会（正统）总部代表会谈纪要十八日在北京签字。
    纪要中双方指出，最近有一小撮人口唱友好，但在行动上却同美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日本反动派狼狈为奸，大搞反华大合唱，破坏中日友好运动。但是，他们这种卑劣的行径，丝毫不能损害中日友好运动的发展，相反地只能更加暴露他们背叛中日友好事业的丑恶面目。
    纪要中双方还指出，美国帝国主义、各国反动派、苏联现代修正主义及其新旧追随者，对毛泽东思想以及中国人民取得的伟大成就，害怕得要死。他们互相勾结起来，搞反华、反毛泽东思想、反对中国无产阶级文化大革命的大合唱。但是，历史将证明：以毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民所进行的这场文化大革命必将取得最后胜利，他们的阴谋必定失败。
    纪要说，日本中国友好协会（正统）总部代表看到：中国人民正在大力活学活用毛主席著作，毛泽东思想越来越深入人心。在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导下，以红卫兵为先锋，以工农兵、革命知识分子、革命干部为主力军，正在进行着更广泛、更深入、更彻底的、史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，对此表示热烈地支持。无产阶级文化大革命正在全国范围取得胜利的同时，中国成功地进行了第五次核试验，出现了工农业全面跃进的局面，对此表示祝贺。日本中国友好协会（正统）总部代表认为，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，是中国人民将社会主义革命进行到底的根本保证，是对全世界人民反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义斗争的一个巨大贡献。
    纪要说，中国方面重申，坚决支持日本中国友好协会（正统）总部，并赞赏日本中国友好协会（正统）总部在一九六六年十二月召开的常任理事和积极分子联席会议所提出的为了进一步发展日中友好运动，必须活学活用毛主席著作的倡议。中国方面高兴地看到，真正促进日中友好的人们，正在日本各地广泛地奋起。这证明了日本中国友好协会（正统）总部是代表广大日本人民的愿望，是获得广大日本人民的支持的。中日两国人民的团结是历史潮流，任何人也抗拒不了的。
    纪要说，双方首先确认，日本各界三十二位知名人士和中国五十二位各界人士一九六六年秋分别发表的声明，和中国日本友好协会、日本中国友好协会一九六六年十月十二日发表的共同声明，是正确的。在新的形势下，它已经成为发展中日友好运动的基础。
    纪要中双方表示，坚决支持越南人民战斗到把最后一个美国侵略者赶出越南。
    纪要最后说，双方就一九六七年度的友好往来和文化、经济交流项目达成了协议，并且表示为进一步将中日两国人民的战斗友谊推向一个崭新的阶段而共同奋斗。
    中国日本友好协会代表廖承志、赵安博和日本中国友好协会（正统）总部代表三好一、春日嘉一在会谈纪要上签了字。
