Our great leader Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" issued by various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai to the entire nation. He also called on all sectors of the Party, government, military, and civilians nationwide to learn from the experiences of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, to act in unison, and to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, ensuring that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advances victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's great call has pushed our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new stage.

Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the correct leadership of Comrade Lin Biao and the Central Military Commission, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the army has also achieved great victories.

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee approved the reorganization of the Central Military Commission's Cultural Revolution Group and the establishment of a new Cultural Revolution Group for the entire army. This is the result of the struggle between the two lines in the army's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a major victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The current situation is very good.

However, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the army through to the end, we must continue to mobilize the masses and overcome numerous obstacles through intense struggle.

These obstacles mainly come from a handful of power-holders within the military who are taking the capitalist road, and from a small number of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. In the past, they have used various despicable tricks to cause trouble. Now, they are still using various ploys to launch new counterattacks.

These obstacles also come from Party cadres whose worldviews have not been transformed. In some units, the leaders still do not understand, are not serious about, or are ineffective in leading this great struggle. Their minds are still filled with various confused ideas. The bourgeois reactionary line still has a market among them.

Is the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the army important or not?

Our army is the pillar of proletarian dictatorship, an important guarantee for the implementation of socialist democracy, and a tool for defending socialist motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The people's guns must be in the hands of those who are truly loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. If revisionists emerge within the army, it is even more dangerous. Therefore, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is even more important for our army.

Our army is personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and has been tested through long-term revolutionary struggles. Since Comrade Lin Biao has been in charge of the Military Commission, our army's revolutionary construction has achieved tremendous success. However, the army does not exist in a vacuum. Class struggles in society inevitably reflect in the army through various channels. The bourgeoisie is trying every means to find their agents within the army. The influence of bourgeois ideology is pervasive. Some people think that the army has no major problems and that the Cultural Revolution can be conducted or not conducted, which is completely against Chairman Mao's teachings and forgets class struggle. This is very dangerous.

Our army is responsible for defending the motherland and must be ready at any time to smash possible attacks by American imperialism and its running dogs. Therefore, the deployment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the army is different from that in the local areas. Within the army, the general troops are different from the high-level leadership organs, academies, and art troupes. However, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the army must be carried out well and thoroughly, which is common and undeniable, and there can be no wavering. Moreover, because the army's responsibilities are heavy, the Cultural Revolution in the army should be particularly emphasized, particularly well carried out, and thoroughly implemented.

In the army's Cultural Revolution, is there a struggle between the two lines?

The facts have proven that the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line is not only present within the army but is also sharp and complex.

Within our army, there is indeed a small handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and a small number of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They are two-faced, deceitful, and use despicable political tricks to resist the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They suppress the revolutionary leftists, stifle the mass movement, shift the target, protect themselves, and attempt to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the army. Their true faces have been exposed, and some are still being exposed. The victories of the Cultural Revolution in the previous stage were achieved through intense struggles against the bourgeois reactionary line. To completely overturn the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminate its evil influence, we must go through a series of arduous struggles and do a lot of in-depth work.

The struggle between the two lines in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution determines the fate of this revolution. If we do not consciously and firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and uncompromisingly fight against the bourgeois reactionary line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our army will not be able to proceed victoriously and may even be aborted.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how should we view the proletarian revolutionary leftists?

This question is a major principle for every comrade.

Some people only verbally support the revolutionary leftists, but in action, they are different. They do not enthusiastically praise the revolutionary spirit of the leftists but instead exaggerate and magnify certain shortcomings of the leftists, even to the point of distorting right and wrong, labeling revolutionary actions as "extremist," "excessive," "overstepping," etc. They do not stand with the revolutionary leftists but instead act as mediators between two completely different principles, muddying the waters, seeking a middle ground, and practicing opportunism. This is actually standing on the bourgeois side, suppressing and attacking the revolutionary leftists, and dampening the spirit of the proletariat while boosting the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

The proletarian revolutionary leftists are the vanguard and backbone of the Cultural Revolution. Without relying on the leftists, there can be no revolution. Opposing the leftists is opposing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary leftists dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to rebel, and dare to revolutionize. Their general direction is always correct. Even if they make some mistakes in the struggle, it is nothing strange. They will educate themselves in the struggle. We should firmly stand with them, wholeheartedly support them, humbly learn from them, sincerely help them, fight with them, and jointly improve. If we are shocked by a few shortcomings, criticize excessively, and put ourselves in opposition to the revolutionary masses, we will inevitably make a big mistake.

Chairman Mao said: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles."

Our leading comrades must firmly believe in Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's thoughts, and follow Chairman Mao's line. They must believe in the masses, closely follow the forward march of the masses, and keep up with the development of the revolutionary situation. We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "Politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better."

Currently, the high-level leadership organs, academies, and art troupes in our army that are carrying out the Cultural Revolution must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call and seriously learn from the experiences of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels. We must further arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, grasp the general direction of the struggle, select the targets of the struggle, and improve the art of struggle. We must develop and strengthen the forces of the proletarian revolutionary leftists, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, and put the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the hands of the revolutionary masses themselves. We must break through the waves and bring out those power-holders taking the capitalist road and those stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line, one by one, and thoroughly fight them down, fight them to ruin, and fight them to stench.

The broad troops of our army must adhere to the principle of positive education, take the struggle between the two lines as the key, and seriously carry out the education of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad cadres and soldiers must, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the struggle between the two lines, strive even harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply understand Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the Party's policies. They must fully recognize the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide and in the army, enthusiastically support the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and raise their revolutionary vigilance, firmly guard their combat positions, defend the motherland's security, defend proletarian dictatorship, defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, our People's Liberation Army enjoys great honor. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our army must be carried out well and can definitely be carried out well. Let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, raise the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao even higher, and advance bravely!

### 一定要把我军的无产阶级文化大革命搞彻底

    一定要把我军的无产阶级文化大革命搞彻底
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定向全国广播上海市各革命造反团体的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，并且号召全国党政军民各界学习上海市革命造反派的经验，一致行动起来，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，使无产阶级文化大革命沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。毛主席这一伟大号召，把我国无产阶级文化大革命推进到一个新的阶段。
    在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，在林彪同志和中央军委的正确领导下，军队的无产阶级文化大革命也取得了很大胜利。
    毛主席和党中央批准中央军委改组全军文化革命小组，成立新的全军文化革命小组，是我军无产阶级文化大革命中两条路线斗争的结果，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的重大胜利。当前，是一个很好的形势。
    但是，要把军队的无产阶级文化大革命搞彻底，还必须继续放手发动群众，还要经过激烈的斗争，冲破重重阻力。
    这种阻力，主要是来自混进军内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，来自极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。过去，他们曾经施展过种种卑鄙伎俩，进行捣乱。现在，他们还在耍出各种花招，进行新的反扑。
    这种阻力，同时也来自党内那些世界观没有改造好的干部。有些单位的负责人，直到今天，对这场伟大斗争的领导，仍然很不理解，很不认真，很不得力。他们的头脑里，还塞满着这样那样的糊涂观念。资产阶级反动路线，在他们那里还有一定的市场。
    军队的无产阶级文化大革命究竟重要不重要？
    我们的军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石，是实行社会主义大民主的重要保证，是保卫社会主义祖国和无产阶级文化大革命的工具。人民的枪杆子，一定要掌握在真正忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的人手里。军队中如果出了修正主义分子，是更加危险的。正因为这样，无产阶级文化大革命，对我们军队来说，就更加重要。
    我们这支人民军队，是毛主席亲自缔造和领导的，经过了长期革命斗争的考验。林彪同志主持军委工作以来，我军革命化建设取得了巨大成绩。但是，军队不是生活在真空里。社会上的阶级斗争，必然通过各种渠道，反映到军队里来。资产阶级千方百计地在军队中寻找他们的代理人。资产阶级思想的影响更是无孔不入。有些人认为军队没有多大问题，文化大革命搞不搞都可以，这是完全违背毛主席的教导，忘记了阶级斗争。这是非常危险的。
    我军担负着保卫祖国的重任，随时都要准备粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗可能的进攻。因此，军队的无产阶级文化大革命，在部署上同地方有所不同。在军队内部，广大部队，同高级领导机关、院校和文艺团体，又有所区别。但是，军队的文化大革命一定要搞好，搞彻底，这一点是共同的，毫无疑义的，决不能借口军队情况特殊，而有丝毫的动摇。而且，由于军队责任重大，军队的文化大革命，就特别应该抓紧，特别应该搞好，搞彻底。
    在军队的文化大革命中，到底有没有两条路线的斗争？
    事实证明，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反动路线的斗争，在军队内部不仅存在，而且是尖锐的，复杂的。
    在我们军队里，确实有那么一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，他们当面是人，背后是鬼，两面三刀，欺上瞒下，玩弄资产阶级政客的卑劣手法，抗拒以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他们打击革命左派，压制群众运动，转移目标，保护自己，妄图扼杀军队的无产阶级文化大革命。他们的狰狞面目，有的已经被识破，有的正在被揭露。前一阶段文化大革命的胜利，正是经过同资产阶级反动路线的激烈斗争而取得的。要彻底反掉资产阶级反动路线，清除这条反动路线的恶劣影响，还要经过一系列的艰巨斗争，还要做许多深入细致的工作。
    无产阶级文化大革命中两条路线的斗争，决定着这场革命的命运。如果我们不是自觉地坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线方面，毫不调和地进行反对资产阶级反动路线的斗争，我军的无产阶级文化大革命，就不可能胜利进行，甚至有夭折的危险。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，怎样看待无产阶级革命左派？
    这个问题，对每个同志来说，都是重大的原则问题。
    有些人只是口头上支持革命左派，而在行动上则另是一样。他们不是热情地赞扬革命左派的造反精神，而是渲染和夸大革命左派的某些缺点，甚至颠倒是非，把革命的行动说成是什么
  “偏激”啦，“过火”啦，“越轨”啦，等等。他们不是同革命左派站在一边，而是在两种完全不同的原则立场之间，和稀泥，搞平衡，搞折中主义。这实际上是站在资产阶级立场，压制和打击革命左派，灭无产阶级的志气，长资产阶级的威风。
    无产阶级革命左派，是文化大革命的先锋和骨干力量。不依靠左派，就谈不上革命。反对左派，就是反对无产阶级文化大革命。革命左派敢想、敢说、敢干、敢造反、敢革命，他们的大方向始终是正确的。即使在斗争中出现某些缺点错误，也没有什么奇怪，他们会在斗争中自己教育自己。我们应该坚定不移地同他们站在一起，满腔热忱地支持他们，虚心地向他们学习，诚心诚意地帮助他们，同他们一起战斗，共同提高。如果看到一点缺点，就大惊小怪，横加指责，把支流当作主流，把自己摆在了革命群众的对立方面，就必然会犯绝大的错误。
    毛主席说：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”
    我们的领导同志，一定要坚信毛主席，紧跟毛主席的思想，紧跟毛主席的路线。一定要相信群众，紧紧赶上群众前进的步伐，跟上革命形势的发展。我们应当遵循毛主席的教导，“政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好”。
    当前，正在开展文化大革命运动的我军高级领导机关、院校和文艺团体，一定要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，认真学习上海市革命造反派的经验。要在斗争中进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，掌握斗争的大方向，选准斗争的目标，提高斗争的艺术。要发展壮大无产阶级革命左派的力量，团结广大革命群众，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运掌握在革命群众自己手里。要乘风破浪，把那些走资本主义道路的当权派，那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，一个一个地揪出来，把他们彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。
    我军的广大部队，要坚持正面教育的方针，以两条路线斗争为纲，认真搞好无产阶级文化大革命的教育。广大干部战士，要在无产阶级文化大革命中，在两条路线的斗争中，更加努力地活学活用毛主席著作，很好地领会毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和党的政策。要充分认识全国全军无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，热烈支持革命群众的造反精神。要提高革命警惕，坚守战斗岗位，保卫祖国安全，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    我们人民解放军，在伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志领导下，享有崇高的荣誉。我军的无产阶级文化大革命一定要搞好，一定能够搞好。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更高地举起以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，奋勇前进！
