Shanghai revolutionary rebel workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, after studying the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to various revolutionary organizations in Shanghai, as well as editorials from the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine and other important documents, are full of vigor and fighting spirit. While actively engaging in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, they have launched a magnificent new wave of production.

Many factories and enterprises in Shanghai have revolutionary rebel workers who resolutely follow Chairman Mao's important directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." They stand firm against adverse currents, unite revolutionary workers, and bravely shoulder the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. The units that first established workers' revolutionary rebel organizations are particularly vibrant. The revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory, following the election method of the Paris Commune, established "Revolutionary Production Committees" at the group, workshop, and department levels after the election. The spirit of the workers has been greatly renewed. Members of the "Revolutionary Production Committees" strictly require themselves as servants of the people, do not stay in offices, do not sit on armchairs, go deep into the production front lines, share weal and woe with the worker masses, and consult with everyone on matters. The workers' labor consciousness has greatly increased. In the steel window workshop, workers actively support each other. A young apprentice in the lathe group displayed great enthusiasm, completing the processing of 64 machine bases on January 9, exceeding the original quota by more than one hundred percent.

The revolutionary rebel workers of the Shanghai Lamp Factory have been launching a counterattack against the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line in recent days. The daily production of the entire factory has rapidly increased. On January 16, the revolutionary rebels in the factory seized revolutionary and production power from a handful of capitalists and stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. On the first day after the seizure of power, which was a factory rest day, a few revolutionary rebel workers from the fourth workshop's electrical group voluntarily came to the factory to rush the production of tungsten-molybdenum crucibles, ensuring that this equipment, which can produce tens of kilograms of tungsten-molybdenum daily, was installed and tested in the workshop ahead of schedule.

The revolutionary rebel workers of the Jiangnan Shipyard have been studying the central congratulatory telegram in recent days, adopting an active and offensive posture to grasp revolution and promote production, and launching a fierce attack against the new onslaught of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. On January 10, the revolutionary workers of this factory held a launching ceremony for the 10,000-ton ship "Zhāoyáng Hào" on the glorious day marking the eleventh anniversary of Chairman Mao's inspection of the factory. Now, revolutionary rebel workers and revolutionary workers are engaged in intense installation preparations. Important equipment is being hoisted onto the ship platform by large cranes, and the "Zhāoyáng Hào" is bustling with activity. Some revolutionary rebel workers said: The letter of respect from the red rebels and revolutionary workers of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory to Chairman Mao is another extremely important document. It expresses the spirit and determination of us revolutionary rebels. We, the revolutionary rebels of the Jiangnan Shipyard, firmly support the struggle of the Beijing revolutionary rebels and the struggle of all revolutionary rebels across the country. We will unite, fight, and win together under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and with actual actions, thoroughly smash the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Near the "Zhāoyáng Hào" is a shipyard with a large ship awaiting repair. Previously, a handful of leaders within the factory who persisted in the bourgeois reactionary line incited workers to leave their production posts, using various excuses to delay the repair, disrupting production. Now, the revolutionary rebels have taken the initiative to shoulder this responsibility, organizing a shock team to strive to repair the ship in the shortest time possible. The production situation in the entire factory is excellent. Revolutionary rebel workers keep in mind Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can the war be waged, and only by relying on the masses can the war be waged." They go to where there are difficulties to fight; if a machine stops, they immediately start it up, ensuring that production is not affected. The entire factory's plumbers, in the situation where a batch of Red Guards were deceived and left their production posts, worked day and night to ensure the normal water supply for the entire factory. A revolutionary rebel worker said: "We work day and night, not for fame or money, but for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution! No matter how hard the work is, when we think of Chairman Mao, we are full of energy!"

In the operating room of the Yangshupu Power Plant, a lively scene unfolds: the main equipment of this plant—the 31st boiler with the largest power generation and the 18th steam turbine generator—is surrounded by many workers who are busy with maintenance. This is the first major overhaul undertaken by the plant's revolutionary rebels after they seized the factory's leadership. They regard this production battle as a political battle to demonstrate the revolutionary rebels' leadership. To win this battle, they held a rally to carry forward the revolutionary rebel spirit on the 16th. At the meeting, revolutionary rebel workers expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," and with the actual action of not stopping electricity for even a second, to launch a counterattack against the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line! Revolutionary rebels seized the leadership of the maintenance of the main equipment from the bourgeois technical authorities, and together with the broad revolutionary workers of the factory, they emphasized proletarian politics, followed the mass line, broke the revisionist technical framework, shortened the shutdown time by half, and greatly accelerated the maintenance speed.

The revolutionary rebel workers and revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Automobile Transport Company's repair shop successfully developed China's first 150-ton heavy-duty flatbed trailer. When they hung a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao on this self-designed and self-manufactured heavy-duty flatbed trailer and, with drums and gongs, reported the good news to the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, the comrades of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters enthusiastically praised them, saying: You have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" with actual actions, excellent! excellent! The revolutionary rebel workers of this factory said: This heavy-duty flatbed trailer was born in the struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and those who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. Without Mao Zedong Thought arming our minds, there would be no such victory. During the development process, those who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line created various obstacles for us, but we, with the "rebel" spirit, are fearless of heaven, earth, gods, and ghosts; we have displayed the fearless revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to do, and dare to rebel, and finally succeeded in manufacturing it. We will advance victoriously, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even more magnificent, and make production even better.

    上海革命造反派工人在伟大毛泽东思想旗帜下团结、战斗、胜利在一起
    用积极进攻的姿态抓革命促生产
    粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，掀起生产新高潮
    新华社上海十九日电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的上海革命造反派工人，在学习中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各造反团体的贺电以及《人民日报》《红旗》杂志社论等有关重要文件以后，意气风发，斗志昂扬，在积极投入批判资产阶级反动路线斗争的同时，掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产新高潮。
    上海很多工厂企业的革命造反派，坚决遵循毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的重大方针，顶住歪风逆流，团结革命职工，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担。最早建立工人革命造反组织的一些单位，更是到处出现蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。上海玻璃机械厂的革命职工，按照巴黎公社的选举方式，建立了小组、车间、科室的“革命生产委员会”之后，精神面貌焕然一新。“革命生产委员会”的成员以人民的勤务员严格要求自己，不蹲办公室，不坐沙发椅，深入生产第一线，跟工人群众同甘共苦，有事大家商量，工人的劳动自觉性大大提高。钢窗车间工人主动地互相支持。车工组一位青年艺徒发扬冲天干劲，在一月九日那一天，完成了六十四只机座的加工任务，超过原定额一倍多。
    上海灯泡厂革命造反派工人连日来在乘胜追击资产阶级反动路线新反扑的同时，全厂日产量迅速上升。一月十六日，厂内的革命造反派又从一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线分子手中夺取了革命和生产大权。夺权后的第一天是厂休日，第四车间电工组的几个革命造反派工人自动到厂来赶装生产钨钼的关键用具镕结瓶，使这种每天能生产好几十公斤钨钼的用具，得以提前在车间安装试用。
    江南造船厂的革命造反派工人，这几天认真学习了中央的贺电，用积极的、进攻的姿态，抓革命，促生产，狠狠痛击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的新反扑。一月十日，这个厂的革命职工在我们最最敬爱的毛主席来厂视察十一周年的光荣日子，为万吨巨轮“朝阳号”举行了下水典礼。现在，革命造反派工人和革命职工，又在进行紧张的安装准备工作，一些重要的设备，正由高大的卷扬机吊到船台上去，“朝阳号”上下，呈现出一番紧张战斗的繁忙景象。有些革命造反派工人说：北京第一机床厂红色造反派和革命职工给毛主席的致敬信，是又一个极其重要的文件，它表达了我们革命造反派的志气和决心。我们江南造船厂革命造反派，最最坚决支持北京革命造反派的斗争，支持全国一切革命造反派的斗争。我们要在伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，用实际行动彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    靠近“朝阳号”的一个船坞里，一艘巨轮急待修理。前些时，厂内一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的当权派，挑动工人脱离生产岗位，以种种借口，迟迟不给修理，破坏生产。现在，革命造反派主动挑起这副重担，组织突击队，力争在最短时间内把船修好。全厂生产形势大好。革命造反派工人牢记毛主席的教导：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”他们和广大革命职工一起，哪里有困难，就到哪里去战斗；哪台机器停下来，就立即去把它开起来，绝不让生产受损失。全厂的水管工，在一批赤卫队员受蒙蔽离开生产岗位的情况下，革命造反队队员夜以继日地连续作战，保证全厂正常供水。一个革命造反派工人说：“我们日干夜干，一不为名，二不为钱，就是为中国革命和世界革命！工作再苦再难，想起毛主席，我们就浑身是劲！”
    在杨树浦发电厂运行车间里，呈现出一派热气腾腾的景象：这个厂的主力设备——发电量最大的三十一号锅炉和十八号汽轮发电机周围，许多工人在紧张地检修。这是这个厂革命造反派夺过工厂领导权以后担当起的第一次大修。他们把这次大修的生产仗，看作是显示革命造反派当家作主的政治仗。为了打好这一场漂亮仗，他们在十六日召开了发扬革命造反精神誓师大会。会上，革命造反派工人表示，一定要坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，以决不停电一秒钟的实际行动，迎头痛击资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！革命造反派把检修主力设备的领导权从资产阶级技术权威手里夺了过来，和厂里的广大革命职工一起，突出无产阶级政治，大走群众路线，大破修正主义的技术框框，使这次停炉时间缩短了一半，大大加速了检修速度。
    上海汽车运输公司修理厂革命造反派工人和革命职工试制成功了我国第一台一百五十吨重型平板挂车。当他们在这台自行设计、自行制造的重型平板挂车上，悬挂着伟大领袖毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓地到上海市工人革命造反总司令部报喜的时候，上海市工人革命造反总司令部的同志热情地赞扬说：你们以实际行动响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，好得很！好得很！这个厂的革命造反派工人说：这台重型平板挂车，是同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的斗争中诞生的。没有毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，就没有这个胜利成果。在试制过程中，那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的人对我们进行种种刁难，但是我们“反”字当头的人是天不怕，地不怕，神不怕，鬼不怕的；我们发扬了敢想、敢说、敢做、敢革命的大无畏的造反精神，终于制造成功。我们要乘胜前进，坚决响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更加轰轰烈烈，把生产搞得好上加好。
