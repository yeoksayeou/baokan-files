Adam Reka sacrificed his life in the struggle against a storm to save state property. His selfless and heroic image shines with the radiance of communism and will forever live in the hearts of the Albanian people.

Adam Reka's moving deeds clearly show that under the guidance of the Albanian Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people are so steadfast and heroic. They fear no storms and can overcome any difficulties, capable of crushing all enemies.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his message of congratulations to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, pointed out that the Soviet revisionist clique, the Yugoslav Tito clique, and all kinds of traitorous and counter-revolutionary cliques are merely "a handful of earth," while the heroic Albanian people are "a towering mountain reaching into the clouds." Adam Reka is a son of the heroic Albanian people.

Adam Reka died for the people's interests, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai. Compared to Adam Reka, those revisionist traitors who kneel down before American imperialism for the sake of "survival" appear so insignificant and shameful!

Adam Reka's example is worthy of our learning. We must learn from his selfless communist virtues and his fearless fighting spirit.

    比泰山还重
    亚当·雷卡为了抢救国家财产，在同暴风雨搏斗中献出了生命。他的舍己为公的英雄形象，闪耀着共产主义的光辉，永远活在阿尔巴尼亚人民的心中。
    亚当·雷卡的动人事迹，清楚地表明了：在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党教导下的阿尔巴尼亚人民，是多么坚强，多么英勇。他们不怕任何风暴，能够战胜任何困难，足以压倒一切敌人。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席，在给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中，指出苏联修正主义集团、南斯拉夫铁托集团，和一切形形色色的叛徒工贼集团不过是“一抔黄土”，而英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民却是“耸入云霄的高山”。亚当·雷卡就是英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的儿子。
    亚当·雷卡为人民的利益而死，他的死比泰山还重。同亚当·雷卡比较起来，那些为了“活命”而拜倒在美帝国主义脚下的修正主义叛徒们，显得多么渺小，多么可耻啊！
    亚当·雷卡的榜样是值得我们学习的。我们要学习他一心为公的共产主义品德，学习他不怕牺牲的战斗精神。
