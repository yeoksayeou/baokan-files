Albanian people in various places continue to hold rallies and write letters in enthusiastic support of the revolutionary actions of the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels. They are jubilantly celebrating the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The revolutionary actions of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels are a decisive blow to the bourgeois reactionary line.

New China News Agency, Tirana, January 17th — Albanian people in various places continue to hold rallies and write letters, expressing enthusiastic support for the revolutionary actions of various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai in repelling the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The entire workforce of the Elbasan Rolling Mill held a meeting on the 16th and sent a letter to the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 32 other revolutionary mass organizations.

The letter stated, "The workers of the Elbasan Rolling Mill express our fighting support for your revolutionary actions. Your actions are a decisive blow to the bourgeois reactionary line, a victory for Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, and a victory for Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant teachings. They demonstrate your political maturity and revolutionary vigilance in strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. We believe that the entire Chinese working class, armed with the experience of Shanghai revolutionary workers in smashing the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line, will accelerate the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong's line."

The letter further stated, "The slanderous and defamatory attacks by imperialism and revisionism against the People's Republic of China are in vain. Revolutionary workers around the world enthusiastically support China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution because they learn from it how to defend the fruits of victory won with blood and life. Under the education of our Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha in the revolutionary spirit of class struggle and proletarian internationalism, Albanian workers are your close comrades-in-arms. We warmly congratulate your revolutionary actions and wish you complete victory in the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line."

The workers of the Fusharriz Sawmill and the members of the Fusharriz Agricultural Cooperative in the Pukë District sent a letter to the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 32 other revolutionary mass organizations, stating, "The workers of the Fusharriz Sawmill and the members of the Fusharriz Agricultural Cooperative fully support your struggle against the reactionary conspiracies of a handful of revisionist and bourgeois conspirators. These people attempt to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, prohibit the spread of Chairman Mao Zedong's immortal thoughts, and obstruct the progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. You have once again demonstrated the glorious tradition of the Shanghai working class, defended Mao Zedong Thought, and set a brilliant example in defending the fruits of victory."

The letter further stated, "Although the working people of Fusharriz are geographically distant from you, our hearts and thoughts are forever with you. Your revolutionary actions are our revolutionary actions. We pledge to you that we will proudly hold high the banner of Comrade Mao Zedong and the banner of deep revolutionary friendship between Albania and China."

    新华社地拉那十七日电　阿尔巴尼亚各地继续集会和写信，热烈支持上海各革命造反团体打退资产阶级反动路线新反扑的革命行动。
    爱尔巴桑轧钢厂的全体职工十六日集会，并通过了致上海工人革命造反总司令部等三十二个革命群众组织的信。
    信中说，爱尔巴桑轧钢厂的职工对你们的革命行动表示战斗的支持。你们的行动是对资产阶级反动路线的决定性打击，是毛泽东主席的革命路线的胜利，是毛泽东主席的光辉学说的胜利。它表现了你们的政治成熟性和加强无产阶级专政的革命警惕。我们相信，全中国工人阶级掌握了上海革命工人粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的经验，将加速在毛泽东主席的路线指引下的无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    信中说，帝国主义、修正主义敌人对中华人民共和国的无耻诬蔑和诽谤是徒劳的。全世界革命工人热烈支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命，因为他们从中学习到应该如何保卫用鲜血和生命取得的胜利果实。在我们党和恩维尔·霍查同志用阶级斗争的革命精神和无产阶级国际主义感情教育下的阿尔巴尼亚工人，是你们的亲密战友，我们热烈祝贺你们的革命行动，并祝你们在反对资产阶级反动路线的斗争中取得完全胜利。

    信中还说，“富夏利兹市的劳动人民虽然在地理上和你们相距遥远，但我们的心和思想是永远同你们在一起的。你们的革命行动也是我们的革命行动，我们向你们保证，我们将光荣地高举毛泽东同志的旗帜和阿中深厚革命友谊的旗帜。
