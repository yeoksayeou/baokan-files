President Dior of Guinea announced on January 1 in Conakry that "Guinea will do everything possible to support the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing this year."

He made these remarks while receiving a friendly delegation from the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Secretariat, led by its Secretary-General, Sennanayake.

President Dior had a cordial and friendly conversation with the delegation members. He praised the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Secretariat for its contributions in promoting unity among the peoples of Asia and Africa in their struggle against imperialism and for national independence and liberation.

Those present at the reception included: Guinea's Minister of State for Finance and Planning, Sefforeye, President of the National Assembly, Makka, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Beavogui.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Algiers, the friendly delegation from the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Secretariat, after concluding its visit to Algeria, issued a news release on December 27 in Algiers. The release announced that Algerian writers firmly support the holding of the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference in China in 1967 and will send a delegation to participate in the conference.

The news release, signed by the delegation leader and Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Secretariat, Sennanayake, said that during discussions with Algerian writers and cultural workers on issues of mutual concern, Algerian writers and cultural workers expressed their full agreement with the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Secretariat's policy of strengthening unity among the writers and peoples of Asia and Africa in their struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States. They also expressed their heartfelt support for the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Secretariat, headquartered in Colombo and with its executive office in Beijing, and pledged to cooperate with it.

The news release said that they also agreed that Afro-Asian writers should unite in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, not in compromise and capitulation. Any attempt to deviate from these principles and to split the unity of our movement must be thoroughly condemned.

According to a report from the New China News Agency, the Botswana People's Party recently issued a statement expressing firm support for the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference Permanent Secretariat's statement condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's staging of a fake third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference preparatory meeting.

The statement expressed that the Botswana People's Party will work tirelessly for the complete success of the third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference to be held in China this year. It also expressed that they will always firmly support the Afro-Asian Writers' Conference Permanent Secretariat and work hand in hand with it to further expose imperialism, reactionaries, revisionism, and their lackeys.
