The congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai has arrived in Shanghai. The revolutionary masses of various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai have been greatly inspired and their revolutionary enthusiasm has soared. They have flocked to the *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* to report their joy, enthusiastically hailing the greatest concern and support of the most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao for the revolutionary rebels.

The revolutionary rebel workers and revolutionary masses of Shanghai Fifth Printing Factory have resolutely followed Chairman Mao's words, "seize the revolution and promote production," firmly guarding their production posts, and ensuring the completion of the printing task for the *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The revolutionary rebel workers of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, with their actual actions of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," have smashed the bourgeois reactionary line's attempt to stir up an economic wind of reaction, disrupt production, and sabotage the Cultural Revolution. This is the scene of revolutionary rebel workers in the converter workshop steadfastly continuing production.

In the struggle to expose the new conspiracy of "stopping water, electricity, and transportation" plotted by a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Shanghai Municipal Committee, the revolutionary rebel workers of Yangshupu Power Plant have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly guarding their production posts, ensuring that Shanghai's electricity does not stop for a single minute.

The revolutionary rebel workers of Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, in the face of a large number of Red Guards leaving their production posts, have shown a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, united with the broad revolutionary masses, and bravely shouldered the burden of revolution and production, ushering in a new situation in both revolution and production.

The revolutionary rebel organization and revolutionary masses of Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory have warmly welcomed the class brothers who were deceived—the Red Guards—to return to their production posts, uniting under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and realizing Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production."

The revolutionary rebel workers of Shanghai Public Transportation Company's Bus Depot No. 2 have resolutely implemented the policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," using every means to keep public transportation running smoothly, thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. This is the scene of revolutionary rebel workers of the Second Team studying the *Quotations from Chairman Mao*.
