The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association, in its last issue of 1966, published a New Year greeting, extending New Year wishes to the revolutionary journalists of Asia and Africa and to comrades all over the world. It wishes them new victories in the struggle against U.S.-led imperialism, Soviet-led modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and in the struggle for complete national independence, democracy, and social progress in the new year.

The greeting states that 1966 was a year of victory. In this year, the revolutionary people of the world, especially the people of Asia and Africa, achieved great victories in their common struggle against U.S.-led imperialism and its chief accomplice, Soviet revisionism.

The greeting warmly praises the Chinese people, who, under the correct and brilliant leadership of the Communist Party of China and the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao Zedong, have armed themselves with the most powerful ideological weapon of the world's revolutionary people, Mao Zedong Thought, and played a leading role in this struggle, achieving great successes in all aspects. The greeting emphasizes that the Chinese people have achieved and are achieving great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This revolution is a movement that has shaken the world, causing imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries to tremble with fear, and giving great encouragement to the revolutionary people of the world. Although the imperialists and modern revisionists still vainly attempt to "isolate" it, the international status and prestige of China continue to rise. This is because China possesses a high revolutionary spirit, which is in line with Chairman Mao's teaching that "the people who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggle of the people who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The revolutionary people of the world all acknowledge that China is not only a strong bastion of revolution, socialism, and peace, but also a reliable pillar for all the peoples of various countries who are struggling for national independence and against imperialism and colonialism.

The greeting also warmly hails the glorious victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. It condemns the dirty political collusion between U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, which is playing a double game in Vietnam, expanding the war of aggression on the one hand and peddling the "peace talks" fraud on the other. The greeting says that the Vietnamese people, who are united as one in the struggle and who are undaunted by any difficulties and sacrifices, will surely win the final victory.

The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association also, in the greeting, expresses its high respect to the peoples of Angola, Azania, Congo, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Portuguese colonies, Palestine, Thailand, Laos, Malaya, North Kalimantan, Indonesia, and other countries and regions who are in the struggle.

    亚非记协书记处新年祝词强调指出
    毛主席领导的文化大革命震撼全世界
    新的一年世界人民在反帝反修斗争中将取得新成就
    据新华社三十一日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处在一九六六年最后一期的公报上发表新年祝词，向亚非革命新闻工作者和全世界战友们祝贺新年，祝愿他们在新的一年中，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，在争取完全的民族独立、民主和社会进步的斗争中，取得新的成就。
    祝词说，一九六六年是一个胜利的年头。在这一年中，全世界革命人民特别是亚非人民，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其头号帮凶苏联修正主义的共同斗争中，取得了伟大的胜利。
    祝词热烈颂扬中国人民在中国共产党和当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的英明正确领导下，用世界革命人民最强大的思想武器毛泽东思想武装起来，在这一斗争中发挥了主导作用，在各方面取得了伟大成就。祝词强调说，中国人民取得了并正在取得无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。这场革命是一个震撼世界的运动，它使帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派吓得失魂落魄，而给予世界革命人民以巨大鼓舞。虽然帝国主义者和现代修正主义者仍然妄想“孤立它”，但是事与愿违，中国的国际地位和威信不断提高，这是由于中国具有高昂的革命精神，这种精神是与毛主席“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务”这一教导相符合的。全世界革命人民都承认，中国不仅是革命、社会主义与和平的坚强的堡垒，而且是为争取民族独立和反帝反殖而斗争的所有各国人民的可靠的支柱。
    祝词还热烈欢呼英雄的越南人民在反美救国斗争中取得了光辉胜利。并且谴责美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团进行肮脏的政治勾结，在越南玩弄一面扩大侵略战争一面搞“和谈”骗局的两面手法。祝词说，在斗争中团结得像一个人一样的、不顾一切困难和牺牲的越南人民，一定会赢得最后胜利。
    亚非记协书记处还在祝词中向正在斗争中的安哥拉、阿扎尼亚、刚果、津巴布韦、莫三鼻给、葡萄牙殖民地、巴勒斯坦、泰国、老挝、马来亚、北加里曼丹、印度尼西亚等国家和地区的人民致以崇高的敬意。
