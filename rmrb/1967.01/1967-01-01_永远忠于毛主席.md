Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the world,
The Communist Party is the rain and sunshine.
Every revolutionary seed grows,
Harvests of fruit fill the granaries.

We are Chairman Mao's good soldiers,
Loyal to the people, loyal to the Party.
Fearless of knife mountains and fire seas,
We brave the winds and waves to forge ahead.

Chairman Mao's works shine with golden light,
Revolution cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought.
Every word and sentence is etched in our hearts,
In great winds and waves, we will not lose our direction.

Forever loyal to Chairman Mao,
Forever loyal to the Communist Party.
We will create a bright red new world,
Relying on the radiant Mao Zedong Thought.
