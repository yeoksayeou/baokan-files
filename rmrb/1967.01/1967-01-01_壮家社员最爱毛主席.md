The Zhuang people rely on the Big Dipper when walking at night, on the helmsman when traveling by boat for thousands of miles, and on their mothers when raising children. The Zhuang people rely on Chairman Mao for everything!

The most beautiful flower is the red azalea, the most evergreen tree is the pine, the most beautiful thing among the Zhuang people is Zhuang brocade, and the deepest affection is for Chairman Mao!

The sunflower loves the red sun the most, the boatman loves the favorable wind the most, and the seedlings love the timely rain the most. The Zhuang people love Chairman Mao the most!

    壮家社员最爱毛主席
    壮族　韦信龙深夜走路靠北斗，千里行船靠艄公，婴儿成长靠亲娘，壮家社员全靠毛主席！花儿最红映山红，树儿最青万年松，壮家最美是壮锦，恩情最重毛主席！葵花最爱太阳红，船夫最爱顺帆风，秧苗最爱及时雨，壮家社员最爱毛主席！
