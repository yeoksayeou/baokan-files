Ghanaian revolutionary writers met with a delegation from the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, led by its Secretary-General, Sennanayake, in Conakry. After the meeting, a joint statement was issued on January 6.

In the joint statement, the Ghanaian revolutionary writers expressed their support for any actions taken by the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau to stop the capitulationist line and splitist activities within the Afro-Asian writers' organizations. The writers also firmly supported the decision made at the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers held in Beijing last June, which decided to convene the Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference in the People's Republic of China in 1967. They stated that they would send a delegation to attend this conference.

The statement pointed out that during the meeting, the Ghanaian revolutionary writers fully agreed with the Permanent Bureau's policy of promoting unity among Afro-Asian writers and peoples in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States. They also expressed their heartfelt support for the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau in Colombo and the Executive Secretariat in Beijing, and pledged to cooperate with them and implement the various resolutions of the emergency meeting of Afro-Asian writers.

Ghanaian President Nkrumah, who was also in Guinea, participated in the meeting. The statement said that President Nkrumah and the Ghanaian revolutionary writers "thanked the delegation and the emergency meeting for their strong condemnation of the reactionary military coup in Ghana, which was instigated by U.S. imperialism."
