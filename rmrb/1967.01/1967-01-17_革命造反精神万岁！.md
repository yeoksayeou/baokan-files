The revolutionary rebels of the *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* in Shanghai have rebelled against the old *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily*. This rebellion is good! This is a new victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We celebrate the rebirth of these two newspapers!

After kicking out those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the rightist elements of the bourgeoisie, the revolutionary rebels of the *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* have presented these two newspapers to the readers with revolutionary content and a completely new look. This event proves a truth: without those who take the capitalist road and the rightist elements of the bourgeoisie, we proletarian revolutionaries not only can carry on the work but can do it excellently!

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, those who represent the bourgeoisie thought that without them, the people could not live. They thought they were great and that all our undertakings could not go on without them. They were waiting to see our jokes!

These people are truly dreaming in broad daylight! In history, all exploiting classes have always looked down upon the laboring people, thinking that only they had "culture" and "ability." In fact, they merely usurped the fruits of labor created by the laboring people and were strutting about. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." We proletarian revolutionaries do not believe that without these fellows, all undertakings cannot go on. If we believed that, what revolution would we make, and what revolutionaries would we be!

When New China was just born, the imperialists shouted that the Chinese Communists only knew how to do politics and military affairs but did not know how to do economics, predicting that we would collapse within three months. Ironclad facts have proven their shouting to be bankrupt.

When the Khrushchev revisionist clique encountered serious natural disasters in our country, they took advantage of the situation, tore up contracts, withdrew experts, and shouted that it was impossible for the Chinese people to develop their own nuclear weapons and modern industry, etc. Now, socialist construction in our country is leaping forward, and our great achievements such as the red atomic bomb, missiles, nuclear weapons, a 12,000-ton water pressure machine, and synthetic insulin have shaken the world. Ironclad facts have again proven their shouting to be completely bankrupt.

What have the Chinese people relied on to achieve all these victories? It is Mao Zedong Thought. Great Mao Zedong Thought is our invincible weapon, the ideological weapon of our revolutionary rebellion. With Mao Zedong Thought and the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, we can create everything. We want to rebel revolutionarily, to seize the whole world for the proletariat, to occupy all positions with Mao Zedong Thought, to dare to take on responsibilities, to dare to raise the red flag, and also to firmly occupy the positions. The enemy wants to wait and see the joke, but they are bound to wait in vain.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without removal, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." The "skills," "knowledge," and "experience" of the bourgeoisie look frightening, but they are actually empty shells. We revolutionaries not only do not believe in them but also despise them, criticize them, and make these paper tigers show their true colors.

We should be like the revolutionary rebels of the *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily*, and make a big rebellion against those in power within the Party who take the capitalist road, make a big rebellion against the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, make a big rebellion against all the decaying ideological systems of the exploiting classes, in a word, make a big rebellion against the old world, make a special big rebellion, and rebel to the end. We should use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to smash the old world and create a brand-new communist world!

Long live the spirit of revolutionary rebellion!

    革命造反精神万岁！
    孟进
    最近，上海《文汇报》和《解放日报》的革命造反派，造了旧《文汇报》旧《解放日报》的反。这个反造得好！这是无产阶级文化大革命中的一个新胜利。我们欢呼这两家报纸的新生！
    《文汇报》和《解放日报》的革命造反派在踢开了那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派、资产阶级右派分子以后，使这两家报纸以革命的内容、崭新的面貌和读者见面了。这件事说明了一个真理：没有那些走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级右派分子，我们无产阶级革命派，不仅能把事情办下去，而且能办得很出色！
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，那些资产阶级代表人物以为没有了他们，我们人民就不能过日子了。他们自以为了不起，自以为我们的一切事业离开了他们就不行。他们在等着瞧我们的笑话！
    这些人真是白日作梦！历史上所有的剥削阶级，总是瞧不起劳动人民，以为只有他们才有“文化”、才有“本事”，其实他们只是窃据了劳动人民创造的劳动果实，在作威作福。毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”我们无产阶级革命派，不相信没有了这些家伙，各项事业就办不下去。如果相信那一套，还革什么命，算什么革命派！
    新中国刚刚诞生时，帝国主义者曾经叫嚷过我们中国共产党人只会搞政治搞军事，不会搞经济，预言我们不出三个月就会垮台。铁的事实证明他们的叫嚷破产了。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团在我国遭受严重自然灾害的时候，乘人之危，撕毁合同，撤走专家，还叫嚷中国人民要发展自己的核武器和现代工业是不可能的等等。现在，我国的社会主义建设飞跃前进，我国红色的原子弹、导弹核武器、一万二千吨水压机、人工合成胰岛素等等伟大成就震动了全世界。铁的事实又证明他们的叫嚷彻底破产了。
    中国人民靠什么取得这一切胜利，就是靠毛泽东思想。伟大的毛泽东思想是我们战无不胜的武器，是我们革命造反的思想武器。有了毛泽东思想，有了革命造反精神，就能创造一切。我们要革命造反，就是要把整个天下夺到无产阶级手中，要用毛泽东思想来占领一切阵地，敢于担起担子，敢于插起红旗，也敢于把阵地牢牢占领好。敌人要等着瞧笑话，是注定白等了。
    毛主席教导我们：不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。资产阶级人物的那套“本领”、“学识”、“经验”，看样子吓人，其实只是空架子。我们革命者不但不要迷信他们，而且要蔑视他们，批判他们，要他们这些纸老虎现原形。
    我们要像《文汇报》和《解放日报》的革命造反派那样，大造党内走资本主义道路的当权派的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，大造一切腐朽的剥削阶级意识形态的反，一句话，就是要大造旧世界的反，要大反特反，一反到底。我们要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，砸烂旧世界，创造一个共产主义的崭新世界！
    革命造反精神万岁！
