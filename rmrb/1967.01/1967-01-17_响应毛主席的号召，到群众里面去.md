Chairman Mao teaches us: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Cultural Revolution even better."

This is the fundamental attitude that all leading cadres and all Communist Party members should adopt towards the Cultural Revolution. Only by acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions can one understand the Cultural Revolution, constantly reform oneself and improve oneself, breathe the same air and share the same fate with the masses, and draw wisdom from the masses. Only in this way can one grasp the initiative and stand at the forefront of the mass movement of the Cultural Revolution.

Whether one is willing and daring to go among the masses is a fundamental dividing line between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview.

The bourgeoisie is fundamentally opposed to the masses. Not trusting the masses and fearing the masses is a prominent manifestation of the bourgeois worldview. In our ranks, those whose bourgeois worldview has not been reformed or has been poorly reformed, always do not trust the masses and fear the masses in the Cultural Revolution. Consequently, they are always passive, encounter obstacles everywhere, and cannot shake off the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, even becoming increasingly mired in it.

An extremely important principle of Mao Zedong Thought is to believe in the overwhelming majority of the masses. This is the essence of historical materialism.

Chairman Mao often teaches us to come from the masses, go to the masses, concentrate and persist, first be a student of the masses, and then be a teacher of the masses. This is a great development of the Marxist-Leninist theory of knowledge.

As long as one has the fundamental attitude of trusting the masses and follows the mass line in work, everything can be done well. This point has been even more evident in this Cultural Revolution.

Some leading cadres have done some work, and their mistakes are not serious, or although they have made serious mistakes, they are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements. As long as they carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, go among the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, examine their own shortcomings and mistakes, be with the masses, and support the revolutionary actions of the masses, they can gain the understanding and trust of the masses. Some leading comrades have done this, and their spiritual appearance has been completely transformed. Their relationship with the masses has improved, and the masses believe in them. They can stand up straight and take charge of various tasks.

But there are also some leading comrades who still do not dare to go among the masses. What are they afraid of? They say they are afraid of bad elements, afraid that the masses will not let go of their "braids," and afraid that the masses will not distinguish between enemies and themselves, labeling them as anti-party and anti-socialist elements. All these thoughts are completely wrong.

Bad elements are always in the minority. The activities of bad elements cannot escape the eyes of the broad masses. Going among the masses and being with the masses is the safest. Only in this way can one identify bad elements.

Do not be afraid of the masses' criticism if one has made mistakes. Being afraid that the masses will not let go of one's "braids" is a manifestation of not trusting the masses. The broad masses are reasonable. As long as one sincerely examines one's mistakes and fights together with the masses against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, the masses will not hold onto one.

The masses can distinguish between enemies and themselves, and they are analytical. They propose slogans with discretion. Some masses, when criticizing leading cadres who have made mistakes, say: "We do not want to label you as anti-party and anti-socialist elements, but we want to criticize you into a leftist." How warm-hearted the masses are to the cadres who have made mistakes! Shouldn't these comrades humbly accept the masses' criticism and education? If some masses mistakenly regard them as anti-party and anti-socialist elements, it is often because they themselves have not drawn a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. As long as they draw a clear line, hold up the banner, and fight together with the masses against the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the masses will certainly regard them as one of their own. There are also cases where bad elements stir up trouble from behind, shift the target of struggle, and deceive the masses into regarding comrades who have made general mistakes as anti-party and anti-socialist elements to struggle against. In such situations, only by going among the masses and making a factual self-examination to the masses, letting the masses understand the truth, can one expose the tricks of the bad elements.

Cadres who have made general mistakes, if they do not go among the masses for a long time, will not understand the masses and will not understand the Cultural Revolution. In this way, the emotional distance between them and the masses will become greater and greater, and the distance between them and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao will become greater and greater. Some people may even step by step develop into criticizing the mass movement, suppressing the mass movement, and resisting the Cultural Revolution and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. In this way, the nature of their contradictions with the Party and the people will change, from non-antagonistic contradictions to antagonistic contradictions.

The Central Committee calls on cadres who have made general mistakes and those who have made serious mistakes but are not anti-party and anti-socialist elements to quickly go among the masses, do not be afraid, and strive to burn away their mistakes in the furnace of the mass movement, pass the test of socialism, gain the understanding and trust of the masses as soon as possible, and throw themselves into the current fiery struggle!

Chairman Mao taught us as early as 1943: "We Communist Party members should face the wind and rain and see the world; this wind and rain is the great wind and rain of the masses' struggle, and this world is the great world of the masses' struggle."

The current Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great struggle of the masses in history, a great wind and rain, and a great world. All Communist Party members, all cadres, including Party members and cadres who have made mistakes, should temper themselves in this great wind and rain and great world, should stand up and join the battle, and together with the broad masses, struggle to smash the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line, struggle to smash bourgeois economism, and struggle to overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road!

### 响应毛主席的号召，到群众里面去

    响应毛主席的号召，到群众里面去
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第二期社论
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    这是一切领导干部，一切共产党员，对待无产阶级文化大革命应当采取的根本态度。只有按照毛主席的这个教导去做，才能理解无产阶级文化大革命，才能不断地改造自己、提高自己，才能和群众同呼吸、共命运，才能从群众中吸取智慧的营养。只有这样，才能够掌握主动权，站在无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的前头。
    肯不肯和敢不敢到群众里面去，这是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的一个根本分界线。
    资产阶级同群众是根本对立的。不相信群众，害怕群众，是资产阶级世界观的一个突出表现。我们的队伍里，资产阶级世界观没有得到改造或改造得不好的人，他们在无产阶级文化大革命中总是不相信群众，害怕群众，因而他们老是被动，处处碰壁，不能摆脱资产阶级反动路线的影响，甚至越陷越深。
    毛泽东思想的一个极其重要的原理，就是相信群众的绝大多数。这是历史唯物主义的精髓。
    毛主席经常教导我们，从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去，先做群众的学生，后做群众的先生。这是对于马克思列宁主义认识论的伟大的发展。
    只要有一个相信群众的根本态度，在工作中走群众路线，什么事情都好办了。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，这一点表现得更加明显。
    有些领导干部，本来做了一些工作，错误并不大，或者虽然犯了严重的错误但并不是反党反社会主义分子。他们只要执行毛主席的指示，到群众里面去，倾听群众的意见，检讨自己的缺点和错误，和群众在一起，支持群众的革命行动，就可取得群众的谅解和信任。有些领导同志这样做了，他们的精神面貌焕然一新了，他们同群众的关系改善了，群众相信他们了。他们就能挺起腰杆子来，把各项工作抓起来了。
    但也有些领导同志直到现在还不敢到群众里面去。害怕什么呢？他们说，怕坏人，怕群众揪住他们的辫子不放，怕群众敌我不分，把他们打成反党反社会主义分子。这一些想法都是完全错误的。
    坏人总是极少数。坏人的活动，逃不过广大群众的眼睛。到群众中去，和群众在一起，是最安全的。也只有这样，才能识别坏人。
    自己有错误，不要害怕群众批评。害怕群众揪住自己的辫子不放，是不相信群众的表现。广大群众是通情达理的。只要自己老老实实地诚恳地检讨错误，和群众一道斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，群众是不会揪住自己不放的。
    群众是能够分清敌我的，是有分析的，他们提出的口号是有分寸的。有的群众在批评犯有错误的领导干部时说：“我们不是要把你打成反党反社会主义分子，而是要把你打（批评）成左派。”群众对于犯错误的干部是多么热情呀！难道这些同志不应该虚心地接受群众的批评和教育吗？如果有的群众把他们误认为反党反社会主义分子，那往往是由于他们自己并没有同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派划清界限。只要他们划清了界限，旗帜鲜明，起来同群众一道，斗争党内走资本主义道路的当权派，群众当然会把他们当做自己人。这种情况也是有的，就是有坏人在背后煽风点火，转移斗争目标，欺骗群众把犯有一般错误的同志当做反党反社会主义分子来斗争。在这种情况下，也只有到群众里面去，向群众进行实事求是的检讨，让群众明白事实真相，才能揭露坏人的阴谋诡计。
    犯有一般错误的干部，如果长期不到群众里面去，就不能理解群众，不能理解无产阶级文化大革命。这样，他们同群众感情的距离，就会越来越远，同以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的距离，就会越来越远。有的人甚至要一步一步地发展到指责群众运动、压制群众运动，对抗无产阶级文化大革命，对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。这样，他们同党同人民矛盾的性质就会起变化，从非对抗性的矛盾转化为对抗性的矛盾。
    党中央号召，犯有一般错误的干部和犯有严重错误但不是反党反社会主义的干部，赶快到群众中去，不要怕，争取早日在群众运动的洪炉中烧掉自己的错误，过好社会主义这一关，早日取得群众的谅解和信任，投入当前的火热的斗争中去。
    毛主席早在一九四三年就教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”
    当前无产阶级文化大革命，是史无前例的最伟大的群众斗争的大风雨，大世面。一切共产党员，一切干部，包括犯有错误的党员和干部，都应当在这个大风雨、大世面中锻炼自己，都应当挺身而出，投入战斗，和广大群众一起，为粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑而斗争，为粉碎资产阶级的经济主义而斗争，为打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派而斗争！
