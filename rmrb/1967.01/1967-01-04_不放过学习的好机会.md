A representative from Indonesia, Ron Tong, who attended the recent emergency conference of Asian and African writers in Beijing, fell ill with acute appendicitis during her visit to Changchun. She was immediately admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Jilin Medical University for treatment. During her hospitalization, she insisted on studying the works of Chairman Mao. She said, "In Indonesia, obtaining a copy of Chairman Mao's works is very difficult. Whoever gets a copy treasures it like a precious gem, reads it eagerly, and never tires of it." She said, "Since coming to China, I have been fortunate to be able to read Chairman Mao's works freely. I have not only witnessed the vivid scenes of the Chinese people studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, but also seen the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought in China. Now that I am sick and in the hospital, this is a good opportunity to study Chairman Mao's works. How can I let it pass?"

In the hospital, the medical staff's daily study of Chairman Mao's works aroused great interest in Ron Tong. One day, while a translator was reading Chairman Mao's quotations, she immediately asked the translator to read slower so she could write down this quotation from Chairman Mao in her notebook.

She said, "Chairman Mao's works are full of truth. The Chinese people love to read them, the Indonesian people love to read them, and people all over the world love to read them."

    不放过学习的好机会
    出席不久前在北京举行的亚非作家紧急会议的印尼代表罗恩唐，在长春访问时，突然得了急性阑尾炎，随即就进入吉林医科大学第三附属医院治疗。在住院期间，她坚持学习毛主席著作。她说，在印度尼西亚要得到一本毛主席著作是很不容易的，谁得到一本毛主席著作就如获珍宝，爱不释手，不知疲倦地阅读。她说：“来到中国以后，我能为随便阅读毛主席著作深感庆幸。我不仅亲眼看到了中国人民活学活用毛主席著作的生动情景，而且看到了毛泽东思想在中国产生的巨大威力。现在，我有病住院，正是学习毛主席著作的好机会，怎么能够放过去呢？”
    在医院里，医务人员们天天学习毛主席著作的情况，引起了罗恩唐极大的兴趣。有一天，翻译正在朗读毛主席语录。她马上要求翻译同志读慢点，把毛主席的这条语录记在笔记本上。
    她说：“毛主席的著作句句是真理，中国人民爱读，印度尼西亚人民也爱读，全世界人民都爱读。”
