In Havana, African and Latin American friends in Cuba express their boundless admiration for Chairman Mao and their enthusiastic praise for Mao Zedong Thought. They cherish the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and vow to follow Chairman Mao's teachings to make revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 17th, African and Latin American friends in Cuba have unlimited respect for Chairman Mao and enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought. They are extremely fond of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and express their determination to carry out the revolution as Chairman Mao has taught.

A friend from Ivory Coast, after receiving a French edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," was very excited and said, "I will definitely carry this book with me and do as Chairman Mao says." He said, "After learning revolutionary theory, one must make revolution and mobilize the masses, as Chairman Mao has said."

A friend from the Congo (Léopoldville) after receiving the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was reluctant to put it down. He said, "Chairman Mao's quotation points out: 'To revolt, to fail, to revolt again, to fail again, until they are utterly destroyed—that is the logic of the imperialists and all reactionaries the world over in dealing with the people's cause; they are doomed to such a fate. This is a law of Marxism. ... To fight, to fail, to fight again, to fail again, to fight yet again, until final victory—that is the logic of the people, and they too are doomed to such a fate. This is another law of Marxism.' I love Chairman Mao very much. We have fought and failed, but we will fight again, and ultimately victory will be ours."

A friend from the Congo (Brazzaville) said, "The 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' are excellent, and I will carry it with me for life. The people of the Congo (Brazzaville) believe in Chairman Mao the most."

A friend from Mali excitedly said, "I love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's line is correct, and the path Chairman Mao points out is the path that the African people must take."

A friend from Bolivia said, "Chairman Mao has written many works. If I get a copy of the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I can learn and master the essence of Mao Zedong Thought in a short time." A revolutionary from Honduras received an English edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and he also hopes to get a Spanish edition. A friend from Peru said, "The most important thing in studying Chairman Mao's works is to deeply remember Chairman Mao's thoughts and apply them."

A student from Bolivia said, "Chairman Mao's strategic thought of surrounding the cities from the countryside has great significance." A revolutionary from Peru said, "Chairman Mao has summarized the experience of people's war and systematized it, and we must study it well." A student from Peru praised Chairman Mao's idea of "a single spark can start a prairie fire" saying, "In Latin America, it has been completely proven that Chairman Mao's words are correct."

    一位刚果（利）朋友在得到《毛主席语录》后，爱不释手。他说：“毛主席的一条语录指出：‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。……斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是马克思主义的又一条定律。’我非常热爱毛主席。我们斗争了，失败了，再斗争，最后胜利一定属于我们。”
    一位刚果（布）朋友说：“《毛主席语录》太好了，我要一辈子把它带在身上。”“我们刚果（布）人民最相信毛主席。”

    一位玻利维亚学生说：“毛主席的以农村包围城市的战略思想具有伟大的意义。”一位秘鲁革命者说：“毛主席总结了人民战争的经验，并且把它系统化了，我们一定要好好学习。”一个秘鲁学生赞扬毛主席的关于“星星之火，可以燎原”这一思想说：“在拉丁美洲，完全证明了毛主席这句话的正确性。”
