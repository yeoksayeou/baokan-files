My heart flies to Beijing with this letter. Recently, I have heard from Beijing Radio about the continuous victories of the Chinese people under the leadership of the great Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and I am extremely excited. This greatly boosts my will and confidence to struggle for the liberation of the Japanese nation and to maintain Sino-Japanese friendship.

Chairman Mao said, "Revolution is an uprising, an act of violence in which one class overthrows another." I am a member of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) and a member of the revolutionary left wing of the Democratic Youth League. My struggle is for the revolution in Japan, for the thorough liberation of the Japanese people. Those anti-China elements are the ones who have completely forgotten about revolution.

Some people try various means to make me leave the revolution. This is in vain. I will not yield! I am determined to fight against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the revisionists.

I will definitely study the great thought of Mao Zedong better and apply what I have learned to the actual struggle. I will definitely struggle hard.

Long live the fighting unity of the peoples of China and Japan!

Long live the great thought of Mao Zedong!

Long live the great Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

　　我一定努力战斗
    我的心随着这封信飞到了北京。最近，我从北京广播中听到了中国人民在伟大的毛主席领导下在文化大革命中不断取得胜利的消息，感到无比的兴奋。这大大鼓舞了我为争取日本民族解放和维护日中友好而斗争的意志和信心。
    毛主席说：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”我是日中友协（正统）的会员，又是民主青年联盟革命左派的一员。我的奋斗的目标是为了日本的革命，为了日本人民的彻底解放。那些反华分子也就是把革命忘得精光的家伙。
    有些人想用各种办法来使我离开革命。这是徒劳的。我决不屈服！我决心同美日反动派作斗争，同修正主义分子作斗争。
    我一定要更好地学习伟大的毛泽东思想，并且把学到的运用到实际斗争中去。我一定努力战斗。
    日中两国人民战斗团结万岁！
    伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
                                          日本　德永
