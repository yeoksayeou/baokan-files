Capital revolutionary cultural workers and the Albanian State Song and Dance Troupe held a grand celebration tonight, filled with the confidence of victory, to welcome the arrival of 1967 together.

In the celebration, the cultural workers of China and Albania sang and danced, praising Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and celebrating the fighting friendship between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Albania, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

Central leaders Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, and Ye Jianying attended the celebration.

Albanian Ambassador to China Vasili Natanaili was also invited to attend the celebration.

Kang Sheng spoke at the celebration. He said, "We are very pleased and happy to welcome the new year together with our dear Albanian comrades. The new year will be a year of greater victories for the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the two countries of China and Albania; a year of greater victories for the glorious Marxist-Leninist parties and the great peoples of the two countries in their struggle against imperialism led by the United States; a year of greater victories for the great Marxist-Leninist parties of the two countries in their struggle against modern revisionism centered around the leadership of the CPSU; a year of greater victories for the peoples of the two countries in their struggle against all reactionaries in the world; and a year of victorious development for the great friendship between the two countries. At the beginning of the new year, we wish the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two parties and the two countries, forged by the beloved leader of the Albanian people, the close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the beloved leader of the Chinese people, the close friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao, to last forever. We wish the great leaders Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha eternal health and longevity!"

When Kang Sheng spoke, the comrades of the two countries applauded warmly and continuously, shouting in rhythm: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

When 1967 arrived, the celebration venue was filled with joy. The comrades of the two countries embraced each other warmly, wishing the great leaders Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha good health and longevity, and wishing the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries to be increasingly consolidated and developed.

Zhang Qixiao, Director of the Foreign Affairs Committee, spoke at the beginning of the celebration. He said, "We are confident that in the new year, we will continue to hear of the Albanian people's one victory after another, and we will see the heroic Albanian people, this great beacon of socialism in Europe, shining even more brightly."

Ba Pei, Director of the Albanian State Song and Dance Troupe, spoke highly of the deep fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries and praised our great leader Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Ba Pei said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is advancing victoriously on the Marxist-Leninist road in China, inspires all true revolutionaries and communists in the world, inspires all revolutionary peoples who are struggling for freedom and national independence and against imperialism and other reactionaries, and inspires all true communists and revolutionary youth in countries ruled by revisionists. He also enthusiastically hailed the success of our country's latest nuclear test, pointing out that this victory once again shocked the imperialists and their revisionist lackeys and made all the people of the world happy.

He concluded, "We are confident that 1967 will be a year of great victories for the peoples of the two countries in their struggle to build socialism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and fight against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the leadership of the CPSU."

The cultural workers of the two countries performed wonderful song and dance performances at the celebration. When the comrades of the two countries sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" together, the audience clapped for a long time, shouting "Enver-Mao Zedong," "Mao Zedong-Enver."
