    Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new and higher stage.

    Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism for the era in which imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is marching towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and dogmatism.
