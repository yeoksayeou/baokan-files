Chinese students studying in Europe, who were brutally suppressed by the Soviet revisionist leadership on January 25 in front of Lenin's Mausoleum, issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters in Moscow on January 26, expressing the strongest protest against the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. The statement pointed out that Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. The enemy can injure our bodies, but they cannot shake our firm resolve to oppose imperialism and revisionism. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On January 25, 1967, we, Chinese students returning to China via Moscow, went to Red Square to pay our respects to the great leader of the international communist movement, Lenin, and to the great Marxist-Leninist, Stalin, by laying wreaths and observing a moment of silence to express our love and reverence for them.

After laying wreaths and observing a moment of silence at Lenin's Mausoleum, we were reading Chairman Mao's quotations when Soviet military police began to push and beat our female classmates. When we sang "The Internationale," the Soviet authorities, who had stationed a large number of military police and plainclothes agents there in advance, attacked and beat us, resulting in a horrifying and serious bloodshed. Among our classmates, more than ten had their faces beaten and bloodied. More than twenty others had their backs, waists, and stomachs beaten, and many were knocked unconscious on the spot and then kicked and stomped on. Among them, four had very serious injuries. The perpetrators did not even spare the female classmates, and some were brutally pushed down the stairs.

This serious bloodshed against Chinese students was entirely premeditated by the Soviet revisionists. We are extremely indignant and strongly protest against the fascist atrocities of the Soviet military police and the Soviet government. We will denounce the bloody crimes of the modern Soviet revisionists to the people of the world.

The enemy can injure our bodies, but they cannot shake our firm resolve to oppose imperialism and revisionism. On the contrary, this atrocity further exposes their fear of truth, fear of revolution, and fear of Mao Zedong Thought. Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. Our beloved Chairman Mao teaches us, "To be attacked by the enemy is not a bad thing but a good thing." We were beaten by the Soviet revisionists, and we feel honored. This shows that we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. The Soviet revisionists are "lifting a rock only to drop it on their own feet," and they will certainly face severe condemnation from all revolutionary people in the world.

After returning to our country, we will definitely join the people of our motherland in the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, let the counter-revolutionary revisionists in China never rise again, and eradicate imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries from the world.

Long live Leninism!
Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples!
Down with modern revisionism!
Long live, long live, and ten thousand years live to our most, most revered leader, Chairman Mao!

    我留学生最强烈抗议苏修统治集团的法西斯暴行
　　毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青年不可侮
　　坚决要把帝修反从世界上彻底铲除干净
    新华社莫斯科二十六日电　一月二十五日在列宁陵墓前惨遭苏联修正主义领导集团血腥镇压的中国留欧学生，二十六日在莫斯科向新华社记者发表一项声明，最强烈地抗议苏联修正主义统治集团的法西斯暴行。声明指出，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青年是不可侮的。敌人可以打伤我们的身体，但是丝毫不能动摇我们反帝、反修的坚强决心。声明全文如下：
    一九六七年一月二十五日，我们路过莫斯科回国的中国留欧学生，前往红场瞻仰国际共产主义运动的伟大导师列宁的遗容和伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林的陵墓，并敬献花圈，以表达我们对列宁和斯大林的热爱和崇敬的心情。
    在向列宁陵墓献花圈和默哀后我们读毛主席语录时，苏联军警开始推撞和殴打我女同学。在我们唱《国际歌》时，苏联当局预伏在那里的大批军警和便衣特务围攻毒打我们，造成了骇人听闻的严重流血事件。我们同学中有十余人面部遭到毒打，头破血流。还有二十多个同学的后脑、腰部、背部、腹部受到毒打，很多人被当场打昏在地时，又遭到脚踩和脚踢。其中伤势极为严重的有四人。凶手们甚至不放过女同学，有些女同学被他们狠毒地从台阶上推下去。
    这次严重的血腥镇压中国学生的事件完全是苏修预谋的。对于苏联军警和苏联政府这种法西斯暴行我们万分愤慨，我们提出最强烈抗议。我们要向全世界人民控诉苏联现代修正主义者的血腥罪行。
    敌人可以打伤我们的身体，但是丝毫不能动摇我们反帝、反修的坚强决心。相反，这暴行却进一步暴露了他们害怕真理、害怕革命、害怕毛泽东思想的丑恶面目。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国青年是不可侮的。我们敬爱的毛主席教导我们说“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”我们挨了苏修的打，我们感到很光荣。这表明我们和敌人划清界限了。而苏修则是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，他们一定会遭到世界上一切革命人民的严厉谴责。
    我们回国后一定同祖国人民一起投入轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动中去，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让反革命修正主义分子在中国永世不得翻身，把帝、修、反从世界上铲除干净。
    列宁主义万岁！
    中苏人民之间的友谊万岁！
    打倒现代修正主义！
    我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
