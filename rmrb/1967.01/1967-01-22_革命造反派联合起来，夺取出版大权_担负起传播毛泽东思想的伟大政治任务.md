The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China.

The theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism.

A ship navigating the seas relies on the helmsman, all things growing rely on the sun. Dew and rain nourish the crops, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought!

The greatest revolutionary teacher of all peoples in the world, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can eliminate all exploiters and harmful elements in the world! With Mao Zedong Thought, we will certainly achieve the great cause of communism. Fish cannot live without water, melons cannot grow without vines. Chairman Mao's works are the compass for the revolutionary people. Chairman Mao's works are the lifeline of the revolutionary people. The most important, greatest, most glorious, and most sacred power of publishing Chairman Mao's works must belong to the revolutionary rebels who love, believe in, worship, and are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. We revolutionary rebels live to spread the great Mao Zedong Thought; we die to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought. If the power to publish Chairman Mao's works is not ours, whose is it? If we do not publish Chairman Mao's books, who will? We revolutionary rebels are the natural owners of publishing Chairman Mao's works.

The class enemies hate Chairman Mao's works to the core and are terrified of the revolutionary people mastering Mao Zedong Thought. For seventeen years, fewer than ten million sets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" have been published nationwide, while various poisonous weeds have been widely printed. A small clique within the Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Culture, and the publishing industry, who are engaged in the business of restoring capitalism, are the living devils blocking the revolutionary truth. This is intolerable! We have risen up in rebellion, exposing them one by one! But they are not willing to accept their defeat. After our most beloved leader Chairman Mao issued the great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," these reactionary elements, using the power they control, are pushing a counter-revolutionary revisionist line of economism, continuing to obstruct and sabotage the mass printing of Chairman Mao's works. Recently, a small clique within the Ministry of Culture, adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, under the stinking banner of the "Ministry of Culture," behind the backs of the Party Central Committee and the revolutionary rebels in the publishing system, secretly plotted to hold a so-called "National Conference on the Printing of Chairman Mao's Works," playing a counter-revolutionary double game, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, and resisting the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels in the publishing system. However, their plot has failed, and the revolutionary rebels in the publishing system have rebelled against them and seized their power. This rebellion is good! It is just! This power must be firmly held in the hands of the revolutionary rebels!

Comrades of the revolutionary rebels in the national publishing system! Comrades of the revolutionary rebels nationwide! Comrades who love and are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought nationwide! Let us unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought! Unite! We will closely unite around Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, launch a general offensive against the small clique within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line! Completely smash their new counterattack!

To resolutely respond to the great call of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," and to ensure the completion of the great political task set by the Party Central Committee this year to publish 80 million sets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," we urgently appeal:

1. Revolutionary workers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in the publishing systems across the country should unite immediately to seize the power to publish Chairman Mao's works! Seize every publishing position!

2. Under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Chairman Mao at its core, the revolutionary rebels should form the "National Revolutionary Rebel Committee for Publishing Chairman Mao's Works."

3. The revolutionary rebels should convene the "National Conference on Publishing Chairman Mao's Works" to discuss and arrange the work of publishing Chairman Mao's works.

4. "Grasp revolution, promote production." Revolutionary workers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in the publishing system must guard their production positions; those who have gone out to link up should quickly return to their production positions, with the greatest enthusiasm and utmost effort, to ensure the completion of the glorious task of publishing Chairman Mao's works this year.

"Once they are completely eliminated, the bright red sun will shine over the globe!"

Revolutionary rebels who have seized power, we must unite closely, publish in large quantities the brilliant and resplendent works of Chairman Mao, fully satisfying the insatiable needs of the broad revolutionary masses. Let the great Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position in our motherland! Let the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao resonate in every corner of the globe! Today's China is the China of Mao Zedong Thought; tomorrow's world is the world of Mao Zedong Thought! Mao Zedong Thought will certainly occupy the entire world!

Revolutionary rebels in the national publishing system, unite!

Revolutionary rebels nationwide, unite!

All power to the revolutionary rebels!

Long live the victorious line of Chairman Mao's revolution!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our brightest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    革命造反派联合起来，夺取出版大权
　　担负起传播毛泽东思想的伟大政治任务
　　毛主席说：领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。
　　　　　指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想！
    全世界人民最伟大的革命导师，当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席是革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。有了毛泽东思想，我们就能消灭世界上一切剥削者，一切害人虫！有了毛泽东思想，我们就一定能实现伟大的共产主义事业。鱼儿离不开水，瓜儿离不开秧，毛主席的宝书是我们革命人民的方向盘。毛主席的宝书是革命人民的命根子。出版毛主席著作这个最重要，最伟大，最光荣，最神圣的权力，只能属于无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚毛泽东思想的革命造反派。我们革命造反派，生，为传播伟大的毛泽东思想而生；死，为捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想而死。毛主席著作的出版大权，不归我们，归谁？毛主席的书，我们不出，谁出？我们革命造反派是出版毛主席著作的当然主人。
    阶级敌人对毛主席的宝书恨之入骨，对革命人民掌握毛泽东思想怕得要命。十七年来，全国出版《毛泽东选集》还不到一千万套，而形形色色的大毒草却大肆印发。中宣部、文化部和出版界里一小撮专营复辟资本主义勾当的老爷们，就是封锁革命真理的活阎王。是可忍，孰不可忍！我们起来造反了，把他们一个个揪了出来！但是，他们并不甘心自己的失败，在最最敬爱领袖毛主席发出“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召后，这些反动家伙们利用所把持的权力，大搞反革命修正主义的经济主义，继续阻挠、破坏毛主席著作的大量印行。最近，文化部一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，打着“文化部”的臭招牌，背着党中央、背着出版系统的革命造反派，阴谋召开所谓“全国毛主席著作印制工作会议”，玩弄反革命两面派，打着“红旗”反红旗，对抗出版系统革命造反派的夺权斗争。然而，他们的阴谋破产了，出版系统革命造反派造了他们的反，夺了他们的权。这个反造得好！造得有理！这个权一定要牢牢掌握在革命造反派手中！
    全国出版系统革命造反派的战友们！全国革命造反派的同志们！全国一切无限热爱、无限忠于毛泽东思想的同志们！在毛泽东思想的基础上我们联合起来！联合起来！我们紧紧团结在毛主席为首的党中央周围，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子发动总攻击！彻底摧毁他们的新反扑！
    为了坚决响应最最敬爱领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，为了保证超额完成今年党中央指示出版八千万套《毛泽东选集》的伟大政治任务，我们紧急呼吁：
    一、全国各地出版系统革命工人、革命知识分子、革命干部联合起来，立即夺取出版毛主席著作的大权！夺取每一个出版阵地！
    二、在以毛主席为首的党中央的直接领导下，由革命造反派联合组成“全国革命造反派出版毛主席著作委员会”。
    三、由革命造反派召开“全国出版毛主席著作会议”，讨论和安排出版毛主席著作的工作。
    四、“抓革命，促生产”。出版系统的革命工人、革命知识分子、革命干部要坚守生产岗位；外出串连的要迅速返回生产岗位，以最大热情，尽最大努力，保证超额完成今年出版毛主席著作的光荣任务。
      “一旦把他们消灭干净，鲜红的太阳照遍全球”！
    夺了大权的革命造反派，我们一定要紧紧联合起来，大出特出光辉灿烂的毛主席著作，全部满足广大革命群众如饥似渴的需要。让伟大的毛泽东思想去占领我们祖国各个阵地！让伟大领袖毛主席的声音，响遍地球上每一个角落！今天的中国，是毛泽东思想的中国；明天的世界，是毛泽东思想的世界！毛泽东思想必定占领全世界！
    全国出版系统革命造反派联合起来！
    全国革命造反派联合起来！
    一切权力归革命造反派！
    毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
