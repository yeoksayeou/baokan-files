	In Nepal, Chinese experts and technical workers who helped build roads have been living in tents they set up themselves since the spring of 1962. For over four years, whether it was the bitter cold of winter or the scorching heat of summer, they have persisted. They cook their own meals, wash their own clothes, grow vegetables, raise pigs, sprout beans, and make tofu. They work alongside local laborers, walking to work and laboring day and night.

	When surveying the road routes, the Chinese experts strictly followed the "Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," ensuring that they did not harm the interests of the local residents. The distance from Kathmandu to Pokhara is 180 kilometers. However, the Chinese experts walked over 600 kilometers on foot to survey this road, identifying six possible routes to choose the one that would be most beneficial to the local residents. During this process, they passed through many fields without damaging a single crop. Their reputation for caring for the people's interests quickly spread. Nepalese farmers would see the Chinese experts and give a thumbs up, saying, "几里亚满茄那么洛察" (The Chinese people are very good). A journalist named Tewje said excitedly, "The experts sent by Chairman Mao are truly helping us build. They endure hardship and toil, work diligently, and think of everything for the Nepalese people."

    吃大苦  耐大劳
    在尼泊尔，中国帮助修建公路的专家和技术工人，从一九六二年春天起，四年多来，不管是朔风凛冽的寒冬，还是烈日如蒸的酷暑，一直是住在自己搭起的帐篷里。他们自己做饭、洗衣服、种菜、养猪、生豆芽、磨豆腐；他们同当地的民工一样，徒步上工，日日夜夜地劳动。
    在勘察公路的线路时，中国专家们坚决执行“三大纪律八项注意”，不损害沿途居民的利益。从加德满都到波卡拉的距离是一百八十公里。但是中国专家为了勘察这条公路，徒步走了六百多公里，勘察出六条线路，以便从中挑选一条对沿途居民最有利的线路。在这过程中，他们多次经过庄稼地，没有损坏一棵禾苗。这种爱护人民利益的名声很快地传开了。尼泊尔农民一见到中国专家就伸大拇指说：“几里亚满茄那么洛察”（中国人好得很）。一位名叫梯伍则的新闻界朋友激动地说：“毛主席派来的专家是真正帮助我们建设的。吃大苦耐大劳，工作认真，一切为我们尼泊尔人着想。”
