News from Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities, as well as from various sectors, celebrates the rebirth of the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily. Revolutionary leftists unite to seize control of the newspapers and resolutely transform them into bastions for the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 20th, our most beloved and revered great leader Chairman Mao highly praised the rebirth of the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily as "a great revolution." This has greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionary factions in the news industry and other sectors in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xi'an, Chengdu, Wuhan, and other cities. They enthusiastically expressed their determination to learn from the example of the proletarian revolutionary factions of the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily, to achieve great unity among the revolutionary factions, and to firmly grasp political, economic, and cultural power in their own hands. Only by seizing all power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the stubborn few who insist on the capitalist reactionary line can we ensure that our country does not change color. The proletarian revolutionary factions in the news industry have expressed their resolve to firmly grasp the fate of the people's mouthpiece in their own hands, to transform the newspapers into bastions for the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, to truly become the mouthpiece of the proletarian revolutionary factions, to become a powerful weapon for the proletarian cultural revolution, and to become a powerful weapon to smash the new counterattacks of the capitalist reactionary line.

The entire revolutionary rebel faction of the Capital Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters expressed their firm support for the newly reborn Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily. They said, "The revolutionary rebels of these two newspapers have seized the leadership of the newspapers from the hands of the capitalist rightists. This power grab is good! Just as our great leader Chairman Mao highly praised it: this is a great revolution, a revolution where one class overthrows another. We are doing revolution, and we must seize power! Seize political power, economic power, cultural power, and all power! We must let all power be firmly grasped in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions!" They said, "Those capitalist 'authorities' always think we workers are rough and uneducated and that we can't do without them. Nonsense! We workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, can run the newspapers well! We will run them even better than they did, a thousand times, ten thousand times better!" The revolutionary rebel faction of the Xinhua News Agency Beijing Branch said: Revolution is about seizing power. The revolutionary rebels of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, in the face of the fierce attacks by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the stubborn few who insist on the capitalist reactionary line, stood up and seized the power from these "masters." This is a good and correct seizure. We must resolutely learn from the revolutionary rebel spirit of the comrades of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, become thorough revolutionary rebels, and make our news agencies the mouthpiece of the revolutionary rebels.

The revolutionary rebels in Shanghai enthusiastically celebrated the rebirth of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, considering it a major event in the history of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. They said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: this is a great revolution, a revolution where one class overthrows another. Chairman Mao's lofty evaluation of this major event is the greatest support and encouragement for all revolutionary rebels in our city."

The comrades of the revolutionary rebel alliance organizations of the Shanghai transportation system, who had supported the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels of the Liberation Daily, said: The revolutionary rebels of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily have seized the leadership of the newspapers, and these two newspapers have returned to the hands of the proletariat from the capitalist rightists, transforming from suppressing the proletarian revolutionary rebels to being a powerful weapon for the revolutionary rebels to counterattack the capitalist rightists and the capitalist reactionary line. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary rebel workers of the Shanghai dye industry said: As soon as the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily were seized by the revolutionary rebels, they immediately enthusiastically propagated the voice of Chairman Mao. When we saw the newspapers publish the experiences of power seizures by some units, we were greatly inspired and enlightened. Not only did our factory seize power, and the company seize power, but we also united with all revolutionary rebels in the Chemical Bureau to seize the power of the Chemical Bureau.

The revolutionary rebel workers of the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory and the revolutionary students of the "Work-Study Brigade" stationed at the factory said, the newly reborn Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily reported the news of our factory establishing a revolutionary production committee according to the principles of the Paris Commune, speaking for us revolutionary rebels, supporting us, and encouraging us! It gave a heavy blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and those who stubbornly insist on the capitalist reactionary line. The newly reborn Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily are clear in their stance, speaking the words of our revolutionary rebels, clearing the way for new things, and we revolutionary rebels love and celebrate it!

The revolutionary rebel headquarters of the Red Guards of various colleges and universities in Guangzhou, affiliated with the Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, collectively read and studied the editorial "Let Mao Zedong Thought Occupy the Newspaper Front" from the People's Daily on the evening of the 19th, and were all inspired. Today, this headquarters held a small discussion meeting. The participants excitedly expressed that the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai have created a new world, setting a good example for us. We will work with the proletarian revolutionary factions in the news industry in Guangzhou to seize the leadership of the newspapers in the hands of the revolutionary rebels! We will follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and we will definitely create a new world. The workers of the Guangzhou Heavy Machinery Factory's East Is Red Combat Team said after reading the editorial, "The editorial of the People's Daily is right: 'The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of state power. The proletarian revolutionary factions must firmly grasp political power, economic power, and cultural power in their own hands.' We firmly support the revolutionary rebels on the news front to seize the leadership of the newspapers from the capitalist rightists. There are a few stubborn few who insist on the capitalist reactionary line, thinking that without them, the newspapers cannot be run. We do not believe this nonsense. The newly reborn Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily are the evidence. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and laughable, not understanding this, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge.' People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can unleash boundless strength and wisdom. We hope that news workers across the country will firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, transform the newspapers into bastions for the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, and play the role of the newspapers as tools of proletarian dictatorship.

The revolutionary rebel factions of various news units in Shenyang and the revolutionary rebels across the city enthusiastically celebrated Chairman Mao's extremely high evaluation of the rebirth of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, which is not only a great support for the revolutionary rebels in the news industry in Shanghai and across the country but also a great support for all revolutionary rebels across the country. The revolutionary rebels on the industrial front expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, to achieve great unity among the proletarian revolutionary rebel organizations, to unite all those who are willing to revolutionize, to act in unison, to firmly grasp the fate of politics, economics, and culture in their own hands, to repel the new counterattacks of the capitalist reactionary line, and to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," so that the proletarian cultural revolution advances victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary rebel workers of the Shenyang Third Machine Tool Factory said, "The revolutionary comrades of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily are not only examples for revolutionary news workers across the country but also good examples for revolutionary workers to learn from." The revolutionary rebel faction of the Liaoning Daily expressed their determination to learn from the newly reborn, revolutionary Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, to resolutely take a stand, to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels, to closely combine with the workers' movement, students' movement, and the revolutionary movement of the broad masses, to charge into battle for the proletarian revolutionary cause, and to transform the newspapers into bastions for the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought.

The proletarian revolutionary factions in the news industry in Xi'an were overjoyed to hear the good news of the appearance of the newly reborn, revolutionary Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily. They said: The proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanghai, the Wenhui Daily, and the Liberation Daily have set a good example for us in the news industry. We will learn from them to firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary factions, to charge into battle for the great cause of the proletarian cultural revolution, to beat the drums and cheer, to learn from their revolutionary rebel spirit, to firmly grasp the fate of the newspapers, radio stations, and the Xinhua News Agency Xi'an Branch in the Xi'an region in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions. We will learn from them to closely combine with the workers' movement, peasants' movement, students' movement, and the revolutionary movement of the broad masses, to make the newspapers and radio stations closely related to the revolutionary masses. In propaganda and reporting, we will be like them, clear and straightforward, without any hesitation. The revolutionary young warriors of the Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters in the Xi'an region said, "The revolutionary, newly reborn Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily have 'killed' their way out. This rebellion is thorough and good, excellent! We welcome it with both hands. This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a new victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The revolutionary rebels of various industries in the Chengdu region and the broad revolutionary masses, after reading the editorial "Let Mao Zedong Thought Occupy the Newspaper Front" from the People's Daily and the news of the rebirth of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily in Shanghai, were all inspired and spread the word. They unanimously agreed that this is a major event in the history of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and a new initiative in the history of Chinese proletarian news industry. The revolutionary rebels in the news industry in Chengdu, after obtaining the newspapers, immediately seriously studied the editorial of the People's Daily. They all expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary rebels of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, to carry out power seizure struggles, to firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels, to charge into battle on the front lines of struggle, and to seize the greatest victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. Recently, the Sichuan Red News Industry Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station, composed of many revolutionary rebel organizations in the news industry, was established under the inspiration of the great revolution of the two newspapers in Shanghai. They said: The revolutionary victory of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily is the victory of the great unity of the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai. We are determined to carefully study this editorial. We, the revolutionary rebels in the news industry, will unite and closely combine with the broad workers, peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary workers, fight shoulder to shoulder, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in every newspaper front in Sichuan Province. The revolutionary rebel teachers and students of various colleges and universities and the Red Guards in Chengdu City enthusiastically celebrated the rebirth of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, pointing out that this is another great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary rebel students of Chengdu Institute of Technology said: The proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanghai have seized the leadership of the newspapers from the capitalist rightists. Their rebellion is good and reasonable! We firmly support them and extend our warm congratulations to them!

After the rebirth of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses in the Wuhan region expressed their warm welcome and support. They joyfully shouted: This is a new victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought. On the 20th, some revolutionary rebels from news units held a discussion meeting. The revolutionary news workers and red rebels who attended all expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary comrades of the Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, to firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels, to charge into battle for the great cause of the proletarian cultural revolution, to diligently study the works of Chairman Mao, and to become red news warriors of Chairman Mao.

    上海广大革命造反派热烈欢呼《文汇报》和《解放日报》的新生，认为这是我国无产阶级文化大革命发展史上的一件大事。他们说，我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：这是一个大革命，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的大革命。毛主席对这件大事的崇高评价，是对我们全市革命造反派最大的支持和鼓舞。
    曾经支持过《解放日报》革命造反派进行夺权斗争的上海交通系统各革命造反派联合组织的火线指挥部的同志说：《文汇报》和《解放日报》的革命造反派掌握了报纸的领导权，这两张报纸就从资产阶级右派手里回到了我们无产阶级手里，由压制无产阶级革命造反派，变成革命造反派反击资产阶级右派和资产阶级反动路线的强有力的武器。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
