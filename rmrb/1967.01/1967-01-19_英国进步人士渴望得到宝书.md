British progressives and revolutionary friends from various countries in Britain are all eagerly hoping to obtain Chairman Mao's works. A bookstore in London that ordered a batch of English versions of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung" from Beijing sold out in just two days. The bookstore employee said that they have reordered another batch because many people have already signed up to reserve copies.

A British named Milne, after obtaining a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung," happily said: "This Little Red Book, 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung,' will definitely have a profound impact on people's revolutionary consciousness and spiritual outlook in various parts of the world, just as it has in China."

    英国进步人士渴望得到宝书
    据新华社伦敦电　英国的进步人士以及在英国的各国革命朋友们都非常渴望得到毛主席的著作。伦敦一家书店从北京订购的一批英文版《毛主席语录》，在两天内就销售一空。书店的店员说，他们又增订了一批，因为已经有好多人登记预约。
    一个名叫米尔恩的英国人士在得到一本《毛主席语录》后高兴地说：“《毛主席语录》这本红书，一定会在世界各地对人们的革命觉悟和精神面貌产生深刻的影响，就像在中国一样。”
