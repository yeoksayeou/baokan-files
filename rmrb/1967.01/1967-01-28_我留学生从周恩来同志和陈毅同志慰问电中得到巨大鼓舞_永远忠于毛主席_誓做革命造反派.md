	Chinese students abroad were greatly inspired by the messages from Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Chen Yi.

	They vow eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao and pledge to be revolutionary rebels.

	New China News Agency, Moscow, January 26 — When the message from Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Chen Yi, representing our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, representing the Party Central Committee and the State Council, was received at the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union in Moscow, our students in transit and all the staff at the embassy immediately jumped out of bed, gathered in the embassy hall to listen to the reading of this message, and quickly passed on the news to nine classmates who were severely injured and lying in their dormitories after being beaten by the Soviet revisionist clique.

	These nine heroic anti-revisionist fighters, after hearing this extremely inspiring telegram, excitedly told the New China News Agency reporter that the warm care of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao deeply moved us. We will forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and become heroes who fear neither heaven nor earth, dare to rebel, and dare to make revolution.

	After all the students and the entire embassy staff finished listening to the full text of the telegram, they shouted in unison, applauded, and sang "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman" and other songs. They also loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely take a stand, be prepared to make sacrifices, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The Chinese students in Europe then passed a resolution to pay tribute to our most, most beloved leader and teacher Chairman Mao.

　　我留学生从周恩来同志和陈毅同志慰问电中得到巨大鼓舞
　　永远忠于毛主席　誓做革命造反派
    新华社莫斯科二十六日电　当周恩来同志和陈毅同志代表我们伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表党中央和国务院，打给我国留欧学生的慰问电传到莫斯科我国驻苏联大使馆后，我国过境留学生和使馆全体同志立即从床上跳起来，聚集在使馆大厅里听取宣读这一慰问电，同时火速把这一消息传给因遭到苏联修正主义集团毒打而受重伤躺在宿舍的九位同学。
    这九位英勇的反修战士听了这一万分令人鼓舞的电报后，激动地向新华社记者表示，最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席对我们的亲切关怀使我们万分感动，我们将永远忠于毛泽东思想，做天不怕，地不怕，敢造反，敢革命的英雄好汉。
    全体同学和使馆全体同志听完电报全文后齐声欢呼、鼓掌，高唱《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，并高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”我留欧学生接着通过了给我们最最敬爱的领袖和导师毛主席的致敬电。
