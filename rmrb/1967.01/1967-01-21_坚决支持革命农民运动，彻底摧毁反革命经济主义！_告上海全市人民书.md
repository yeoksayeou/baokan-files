Comrades and fellow fighters of the revolutionary workers, peasants, students, cadres, and all revolutionary rebel organizations of the whole city!

The peasants of Shanghai have risen up in rebellion!

Under the great encouragement of the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Shanghai region has entered a new stage. The strength of the revolutionary rebels has rapidly grown, and the firepower against the bourgeois reactionary line has become more intense. The situation is getting better and better! Amidst the thunderous roar of the bombardment of the bourgeois reactionary line of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, more than three million peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai have risen up to join the revolutionary torrent. They are making a big fuss against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the handful of diehards who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and the bourgeois reactionary line itself. Their targets are clear and unstoppable. The rise of the revolutionary peasant movement is a great event worth celebrating in the cultural revolution of Shanghai, and their revolutionary actions are excellent! Their general direction is completely correct, and all revolutionary comrades must resolutely support the revolutionary peasant movement.

The revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants have risen up in rebellion, and the revolutionary rebels have united to rebel. They will seize back all the leadership positions usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the diehards who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. This revolutionary action has frightened the reactionaries out of their wits. But they are still struggling desperately, using every means to create disorder and stir up conflicts within the revolutionary rebels, to sabotage the great alliance of the revolutionary rebels, and to sabotage this struggle for power with great strategic significance. Now, they are trying to defend their positions in the countryside, spreading the black wind of counter-revolutionary economism from the cities to the countryside, further expanding the gap between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, and deliberately creating conflicts between peasants and workers, inciting peasants and workers to oppose each other. This is to sabotage the socialist economy in the countryside and the foundation of the dictatorship of the proletariat—the alliance between workers and peasants. On January 9, the main responsible person of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee openly told the representatives of the rebel teams of the ten counties in the suburbs of Shanghai: "If they rebel against you, you should rebel against them!" This fully exposes their political conspiracy. As Chairman Mao taught us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." We, the fighters of the revolutionary rebels, must be a hundred times more vigilant and be ready to give a crushing blow to any new counterattack by the bourgeois reactionary line at any time!

We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The handful of people within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who create conflicts between workers and peasants, we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, must more resolutely unite with revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and other revolutionary masses, and swear to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, swear to defend the alliance between workers and peasants, and swear to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must firmly grasp in our own hands the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the fate of the socialist economy!

The struggle between the two lines has reached a crucial moment, and the comprehensive class struggle is unfolding. We must press on and launch a comprehensive attack on the bourgeois reactionary line! At this time when the peasant movement is rising, we appeal to all revolutionary organizations, revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres to give it full support.

1. Recently, many revolutionary peasants have risen up to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, to counterattack the black wind of counter-revolutionary revisionist economism, and to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. We fully support their revolutionary actions! We appeal to all revolutionary rebel organizations to take immediate action to resolutely support their revolutionary actions. All revolutionary rebel fighters must emphasize politics, vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought, exchange revolutionary experiences, and quickly bring the revolutionary experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the revolutionary rebels to the peasants who come to the urban areas! At the same time, we must be vigilant against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the countryside, who, in order to evade the struggle of the masses and shift the direction of the struggle, will use the tactic of "luring the tiger away from the mountain" to incite the peasants to leave their production posts in large numbers and rush to the cities, thus increasing the pressure on the cities. Revolutionary rebels in factories and in the countryside must both be models of "grasp revolution, promote production."

2. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the diehards who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have, in order to achieve the goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, arbitrarily signed documents and squandered the blood and sweat of the working people, using methods such as increasing wages, improving benefits, changing the management relationship of enterprises, merging enterprises, and changing the ownership system to sabotage production and sabotage the cultural revolution, and shift the direction of the revolutionary struggle. They create contradictions and expand differences in the income distribution of collective ownership enterprises in the countryside, the income distribution of workers and peasants who are both workers and peasants, and the income distribution of workers who have been sent down. They stir up the masses against each other, obstructing the normal conduct of year-end distribution and seriously affecting the enthusiasm of the members for production. To repel this black wind of counter-revolutionary economism, we solemnly declare: The signatures of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party on economic issues are hereby null and void starting today. We will resolutely follow the relevant regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China against economism. Currently, for the issue of year-end distribution in the countryside, we must fully mobilize the masses, emphasize proletarian politics, correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the members, seriously implement the distribution policy, and resolutely oppose the practice of not leaving or leaving little production funds, not raising or raising little collective accumulation, and pursuing only the distribution of more.

3. In order to achieve the great unity and alliance of our proletarian revolutionary rebel organizations, and to actively support the rise of the revolutionary peasant movement, according to the demands of the masses, we decide to drag the ringleaders of the counter-revolutionary economism within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to the suburbs of the city to be criticized and struggled against by the masses, further exposing and smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly eliminating the poison of counter-revolutionary economism.

4. Revolutionary students and revolutionary cadres must take action, organize and plan to go to the countryside, combine with the peasant masses, vigorously promote Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and sweep away the black wind of economism. Workers and young intellectuals who have been sent down to the countryside in the past few years to participate in agricultural production should settle down to participate in agricultural production and actively join the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary cadres unite!

Launch a nationwide comprehensive class struggle!

Long live the revolutionary movements of workers, peasants, and students!

Thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the great leader, great supreme commander, great helmsman, and great teacher Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand thousand years!

　  坚决支持革命农民运动，彻底摧毁反革命经济主义！
　　——告上海全市人民书
    新华社上海二十日电　《文汇报》和《解放日报》二十日在第一版同时发表了《坚决支持革命农民运动，彻底摧毁反革命经济主义！——告上海全市人民书》，全文如下：全市革命工人、革命农民、革命学生、革命干部和各革命造反派组织的同志们！战友们！
    上海的革命农民起来造反了！
    在中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体贺电的极大鼓舞下，上海地区无产阶级文化大革命推进到一个新的阶段。革命造反派的力量迅速壮大，反击资产阶级反动路线的火力更加猛烈，形势越来越好！在万炮齐轰上海市委资产阶级反动路线的隆隆声中，上海郊区三百多万农民纷纷起来投入革命洪流，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造地、富、反、坏、右的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，矛头所向，锐不可挡。革命农民运动的兴起，是上海地区文化大革命中一件值得欢庆的大事，他们的革命行动好得很！他们的大方向是完全正确的，一切革命同志必须最坚决地支持革命农民运动。
    革命的贫下中农起来造反了，革命造反派联合起来造反了，把一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派、极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子篡夺的领导权，统统夺回来，坚决夺回来！这个革命行动，吓得那些反动分子丧魂落魄。但他们仍然在进行疯狂挣扎，千方百计在革命造反派内部制造混乱、挑起纠纷，破坏革命造反派的大联合，破坏这个具有伟大战略意义的夺权斗争。现在，他们又企图固守农村阵地，把反革命经济主义的黑风从城市刮到农村，进一步扩大工农差别、城乡差别，竭力制造工农之间的矛盾，煽动农民和工人闹对立，以此来破坏农村社会主义经济，破坏无产阶级专政的基础——工农联盟。一月九日，上海市委主要负责人公然对上海郊区十县农民造反队代表们说：“他们工人要造你们的反，你们就把它造回来嘛！”这就充分暴露了他们的政治阴谋。正如毛主席所教导的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”我们革命造反派的战士们必须百倍地提高警惕，谨防他们转移斗争大方向，随时准备给资产阶级反动路线的任何新反扑以迎头痛击！
    我们必须永远牢记毛主席的教导：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”上海市委内一小撮人制造工农之间的矛盾，我们广大贫下中农就要更坚决地和革命工人、革命学生、革命干部和其他革命群众团结在一起，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政，誓死捍卫工农联盟，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己手里！
    两条路线的斗争到了关键的时刻，全面的阶级斗争正在展开，我们必须乘胜追击，向资产阶级反动路线展开全面进攻！正值农民运动兴起的时候，我们呼吁一切革命组织、革命工人、革命学生、革命干部都要大力加以支持。
    一、近来，许多革命农民起来批判上海市委资产阶级反动路线，反击反革命修正主义的经济主义黑风，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，我们对他们的革命行动表示最坚决的支持！我们呼吁各革命造反派组织立即行动起来，坚决支持他们的革命行动。各革命造反派战士一定要突出政治，大力宣传毛泽东思想，交流革命经验，使来到市区的农民兄弟尽快地把革命造反派的无产阶级文化大革命经验带回农村去！同时，也必须警惕农村中党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了逃避群众斗争，转移斗争大方向，使自己蒙混过关，而采取“调虎离山”计，煽动农民大批离开生产岗位，涌向城市，增加城市压力的新阴谋。革命造反派在工厂在农村都要做“抓革命，促生产”的模范。
    二、上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，为了达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的，胡乱签字，任意挥霍劳动人民的血汗，以增加工资、提高福利和改变企业管理的所属关系、并厂、改变所有制的办法来破坏生产、破坏文化大革命，转移革命斗争的大方向。他们在农村集体所有制企业和亦工亦农社员、外出的下放工人的收入分配上，制造矛盾，扩大差别，挑动群众斗群众，阻碍了年终分配的正常进行，严重影响社员的生产积极性。为了击退这股反革命经济主义的黑风，我们郑重宣布：党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在经济问题上的这类签字，自即日起一律作废，坚决按照中共中央反对经济主义的有关规定办事。当前对农村年终分配问题，必须充分发动群众，突出无产阶级政治，正确处理国家、集体、社员三者之间关系，认真执行分配政策，坚决反对不留和少留生产资金，不提和少提集体积累，单纯追求片面多分的做法。
    三、为了实现我们无产阶级革命造反派组织的大联合大团结，为了积极地支持革命农民运动的兴起，根据群众要求，决定把上海市委内推行反革命经济主义的罪魁祸首揪到市郊各县交给群众批判斗争，进一步揭露和粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，彻底肃清反革命经济主义的流毒。
    四、革命学生、革命干部要积极行动起来，有组织、有计划地到农村去，同农民群众相结合，大力宣传毛主席的革命路线，横扫经济主义的黑风。前几年下放农村已参加农业生产的工人和知识青年，应该安心参加农业生产，积极投入农村无产阶级文化大革命运动，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    工人阶级和贫下中农、革命师生、革命干部联合起来！
    展开全国全面的阶级斗争！
    革命的工人运动、农民运动、学生运动万岁！
    彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
