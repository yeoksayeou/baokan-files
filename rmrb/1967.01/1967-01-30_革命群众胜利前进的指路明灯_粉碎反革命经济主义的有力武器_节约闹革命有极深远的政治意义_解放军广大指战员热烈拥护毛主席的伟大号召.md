The great leader Chairman Mao recently issued the wise instruction to "save and make revolution." This has sparked a strong response among the broad ranks of officers and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army, as well as among the revolutionary rebels in various military academies, military factories, and cultural units. They say that Chairman Mao's great instruction is a beacon for the victorious advance of the revolutionary masses, and a powerful weapon to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. We revolutionary soldiers enthusiastically support, seriously study, resolutely carry out, and passionately propagate Chairman Mao's great instruction. We unanimously declare that we will actively support the broad revolutionary masses of the left, protect state property, and safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the past two days, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers in various units have attentively listened to and studied Chairman Mao's instruction to "save and make revolution." They immediately put up blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers to widely propagate this great instruction. Many officers and soldiers in various units have held lively discussions. They say that at this unprecedented moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when we are in a new stage, when we are repelling the new counterattack of counter-revolutionary economism, and when the revolutionary masses of the proletariat are uniting to seize power, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the solemn call to "save and make revolution." This has extremely profound political significance. This great call is our guide for thought and our standard for action; it is the motto for revolutionary soldiers. The 8th Company of the Fuzhou troops, known as the "model company on the coastal defense front," has been fighting on the front lines for years. Enemy bullets cannot defeat them, and "sugar bullets" cannot hit them. They have a heart of red for the revolution. When they studied Chairman Mao's instruction, they deeply felt that saving and making revolution is the greatest characteristic of proletarian revolutionary soldiers. Only by saving and making revolution can we always maintain a vigorous fighting spirit, stay close to the masses, and forever stand unshakable!

The revolutionary rebels in all military academies, military factories, and cultural units across the army have, while studying Chairman Mao's instruction to "save and make revolution," repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift and hard work. They say that hard work and thrift are the consistent teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao. Today, when we are fighting against a handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, we must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instruction to "save and make revolution," carry forward the glorious traditions of our party and army, and maintain the character of proletarian revolutionary soldiers.

Many units have also sent propaganda teams and broadcasting cars to factories and villages to propagate Chairman Mao's instruction to "save and make revolution." They are determined to quickly let the broad revolutionary masses grasp Chairman Mao's instruction and advance to victory.

    据新华社二十七日讯　我们伟大的领袖毛主席最近发出的“要节约闹革命”的英明指示，在中国人民解放军广大指战员和各军事院校、军事工厂、部队文艺单位的革命造反派中，引起了强烈反响。他们说，毛主席这一伟大指示，是广大革命群众胜利前进的指路明灯，是粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的有力武器。我们革命战士热烈拥护、认真学习、坚决执行、热情宣传毛主席这一伟大指示，并一致表示，要积极支持左派广大革命群众，保护国家财产，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。
    这两天，各部队广大指战员认真收听和学习了毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示。他们马上出黑板报、墙报，广泛宣传这一伟大指示。许多部队的指战员热烈地进行了座谈讨论。他们说，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进入新阶段，在击退反革命经济主义的新反扑，在无产阶级革命派联合起来进行夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了“要节约闹革命”的庄严号召，有着极其深远的政治意义。这一伟大号召是我们思想的指南、行动的准则，是革命战士的座右铭。被誉为“海防前线好八连”的福州部队某部工兵连，长年累月战斗在前线，敌人的钢弹打不垮，“糖弹”击不中，一片赤心为革命。他们学习毛主席这一指示时，深有体会地说，节约闹革命，这是无产阶级革命战士的最大本色。只有节约闹革命，我们才能经常保持旺盛斗志，密切联系群众，永远立于不败之地！
    全军各军事院校、军事工厂、文艺单位的革命造反派，在学习毛主席“要节约闹革命”这一指示时，还反复学习了毛主席关于勤俭节约艰苦奋斗的教导。他们说，艰苦奋斗，勤俭节约，是我们伟大领袖毛主席对我们一贯的教导。今天，我们在与一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争时，一定要坚决执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，发扬我党我军的光荣传统，保持无产阶级革命战士的本色。
    许多部队还纷纷派出宣传队，广播车，深入工厂、农村，宣传毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，他们决心尽快地让广大革命群众掌握毛主席的指示，胜利前进。
