With the rebirth of the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily*, a chain reaction has led to the emergence of a large number of new, revolutionary factories, institutions, and schools. The proletarian revolutionary factions have united to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, firmly grasping the political, economic, and cultural power of Shanghai in their own hands. This is a great initiative by the proletarian revolutionary factions under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, liberating themselves and taking control of their own destiny.

Power seizure in the revolution is excellent! This is a great revolution, a revolution of one class overthrowing another.

Power seizure in the revolution is excellent! This is a victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao over the bourgeois reactionary line. Its appearance immediately received the most resolute, timely, and powerful support from our great leader Chairman Mao.

Power seizure in the revolution is excellent! It marks a new turning point in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, signaling the entry of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into a new stage.

Power seizure in the revolution is excellent! It greatly boosts the revolutionary morale of the proletariat and sweeps away the bourgeois dignity and prestige. This revolutionary action has provoked the extreme hatred of a handful of power-holders within the Shanghai Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They use the most vicious language to slander and mock it. However, Chairman Mao teaches us: being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. The more the power seizure in the revolution is vigorously opposed by a handful of reactionaries, the more it proves that it is excellent!

"You have gone too far!" Yes, gentlemen, you are right. We are indeed going to "go too far." You, this handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, in the places and units you control, use the Party power, state power, and financial power you hold to deceive, corrupt, strike, and suppress the masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to preserve your own power. We revolutionary rebels dare to seize back the power you have usurped and issue orders, directing everything. This so-called "excessive" action is precisely what the revolution needs. Do you want us revolutionary rebels to be "obedient and law-abiding" under your rule, gentlemen of the bourgeoisie? No, not in a million years!

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. With power, you have everything. Without power, you lose everything. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the final analysis, is a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over power. Your policy towards us is: seize every inch of power, do not yield an inch. We are acting according to your methods, giving you a tit-for-tat, fighting for every inch of ground. We must seize the leadership of the proletarian dictatorship, the leadership of newspapers and all propaganda tools, the leadership of the socialist economy, all from your hands. We will not rest until our goal is achieved.

"You are creating chaos!" Nonsense. You are the ones creating chaos. You plot conspiracies, use tricks, and spread a counter-revolutionary wind of economic opportunism, disrupting production, transportation, the market, and the Cultural Revolution, creating all sorts of counter-revolutionary chaos. Our power seizure is to strike at your disruptive activities. You slander the power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels as "creating chaos," completely turning black into white and confusing right and wrong. The power seizure struggle of the revolutionary rebels has disrupted your dreams, gentlemen, and thrown your plans into disarray. So, you cry out "chaos." Pathetic gentlemen, our power seizure is to make your old order chaotic. This "chaos" of destroying the old order, you shout: "Terrible!" While the revolutionary people all cheer: "Excellent!"

"The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not be reconciled to their defeat and will make a final struggle." The proletarian revolutionary people have seized power from the handful of power-holders within the Shanghai Party who are taking the capitalist road. These reactionaries will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, making a desperate struggle and launching new counterattacks. They will use the lack of experience of the revolutionary masses and the old social habits to set traps and find loopholes, attempting to provoke contradictions between the proletarian revolutionary factions and between some masses and the revolutionary rebels; during the power seizure process of the revolutionary masses, they will secretly sabotage, using many trivial matters to bind the revolutionary masses, dispersing the energy of the proletarian revolutionary factions, preserving their strength, and waiting for an opportunity to rise again; they will even appear in an ultra-leftist guise, also waving the banner of "power seizure," organizing conservatives to stage a fake "power seizure." All revolutionary masses must remain highly vigilant, timely expose and smash the enemy's plots and tricks, and must not be naive, simplifying the complex class struggle.

Power seizure in the revolution is excellent! The proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanghai unite, mobilize the broad revolutionary masses, under the leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, launch a comprehensive class struggle, resolutely seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road! Look! A new Shanghai of proletarian dictatorship, bathed in the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, will soon appear on the shores of the East China Sea with the arrival of spring.

Power seizure in the revolution is excellent!

Long live the proletarian dictatorship!

### 革命的夺权好得很！

　　革命的夺权好得很！
　　上海《解放日报》一月二十日社论
    随着《文汇报》和《解放日报》的新生，像连锁反应一样，一大批崭新的、革命的工厂、机关、学校出现了。无产阶级革命派联合起来，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺权，把上海市的政治、经济、文化的大权，牢牢地掌握在自己手里，这是无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，自己解放自己，自己掌握自己命运的一个伟大创举。
    革命的夺权好得很！这是一场大革命，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的大革命。
    革命的夺权好得很！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线反对资产阶级反动路线的胜利。它一出现，就得到了我们伟大的领袖毛主席最坚决、最及时、最有力的支持。
    革命的夺权好得很！它标志着我国无产阶级文化大革命到达了一个新的转折点，标志着我国的无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段。
    革命的夺权好得很！它大长无产阶级的革命志气，使资产阶级的体面威风扫地以尽。这个革命行动，引起了上海地区一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的极大的仇恨。他们使用最恶毒的语言辱骂它，嘲笑它。但是，毛主席教导我们：被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。革命的夺权，越是遭到一小撮反动分子的起劲反对，就越是说明它好得很！
      “你们太过分了！”对！先生们，你们说对了。我们就是要“过分”。你们这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，在你们盘踞的地方和单位，利用被你们掌握着的党权、政权、财权，在无产阶级文化大革命中，蒙骗群众，腐蚀群众，打击群众，镇压群众，玩阴谋，闹反扑，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，以保住自己既得权力。我们革命造反派“敢”字当头，把你们篡夺去的权力夺回来，并且发号施令，指挥一切，这种所谓“过分”的举动，正是革命的需要。难道要我们革命造反派在你们这班资产阶级老爷们的统治下“安分守己”吗？不行，一万个不行！
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权，就有了一切。丧失政权，就丧失了一切。这场无产阶级文化大革命，归根结底，就是一场无产阶级和资产阶级之间你死我活的夺权斗争。你们对我们的方针是：寸权必夺，绝不让步。我们是按照你们的方法行事，来个针锋相对，寸土必争。我们要把无产阶级专政的领导权，把报纸和一切舆论工具的领导权，把社会主义经济的领导权，统统地从你们手中夺过来，不达目的，誓不罢休。
      “你们制造混乱！”胡说。制造混乱的是你们。你们耍阴谋，搞诡计，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，破坏生产，破坏交通，破坏市场，破坏文化大革命，制造种种反革命混乱。我们夺权，就是打击你们的捣乱活动。你们把革命造反派的夺权斗争污蔑为“制造混乱”，完全是颠倒黑白，混淆视听。革命造反派的夺权斗争，搅动了你们这班老爷们的酣梦，打乱了你们的阵脚，所以你们要大叫“混乱”。可怜的先生们，我们夺权，就是要把你们的旧秩序搞得乱乱的。这种破坏旧秩序的“乱”，你们叫嚷：“糟得很！”而革命人民都齐声欢呼：“好得很！”
      “帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”无产阶级革命人民从上海地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的手中夺了权，这些反动分子还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，进行垂死挣扎，掀起新的反扑。他们利用革命群众缺乏经验和旧的社会习惯势力，设圈套，钻空子，妄图挑起无产阶级革命派之间的矛盾，挑起一部分群众和革命造反派之间的矛盾；在革命群众夺权过程中，他们又会暗中捣鬼，用许多烦琐的事务来束缚革命群众，分散无产阶级革命派的精力，保存自己的实力，伺机东山再起；他们甚至还会以极“左”的面貌出现，也打着“夺权”的旗号，组织保守派搞假
  “夺权”。一切革命群众务必保持高度警惕，及时识破、揭露和粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。
    革命的夺权好得很！上海无产阶级革命派联合起来，团结广大革命群众，在伟大统帅毛主席的领导下，展开全面的阶级斗争，坚决向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权！看吧！一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想灿烂光辉照耀下的无产阶级专政的新上海，即将随着春天的骄阳出现在东海之滨。
      革命的夺权好得很！
    无产阶级专政万岁！（新华社二十二日讯）
