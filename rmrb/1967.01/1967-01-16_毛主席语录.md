	Chairman Mao's Quotations
	Without a correct political standpoint, it is as if there is no soul.
	Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental change in the socio-economic system.
	Education should be given to trade union comrades and the working masses to make them understand that they must not only see the immediate and partial benefits and forget the long-term interests of the working class.

    毛主席语录
    没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。
    政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。
    应当向工会同志和工人群众进行教育，使他们懂得，决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益。
