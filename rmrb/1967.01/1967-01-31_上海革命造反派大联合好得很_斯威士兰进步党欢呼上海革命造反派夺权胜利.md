The great unity of Shanghai revolutionary rebels is excellent. The Swaziland Progressive Party celebrates the victory of Shanghai revolutionary rebels in seizing power.

New China News Agency Cairo, January 25th, the Swaziland Progressive Party wrote a letter to the New China News Agency Cairo Branch, celebrating the "great unity of all revolutionary rebels and revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai as proletarian revolutionary rebel organizations."

The letter praises the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao as the only revolutionary line, and Mao Zedong Thought as "the highest development of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

The letter states that all revolutionary masses in China are fighting victoriously to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. "This is the task given by Chairman Mao. Imperialists and revisionists will inevitably be in a state of panic because this is the sharp struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a more profound stage of the socialist revolution that shakes the world today." The letter also states that it is very important for the revolutionary masses to grasp the destiny of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist revolution in their own hands.

The letter points out that all the conspiracies of imperialists and revisionists to distort and slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat are doomed to fail. The letter emphasizes: "Chairman Mao said: 'I think that for us, a person, a party, an army, or a school, if not opposed by the enemy, that would not be good, that would definitely mean colluding with the enemy.'"

The letter concludes: "Chairman Mao is leading the 700 million Chinese people in the great cause of socialist revolution with victory; this cultural revolution has shattered the imperialists' dream of capitalist restoration in China and the emergence of revisionism in China. This revolution will accelerate the enemy's comprehensive failure and bring great victory to the world revolution."

　　上海革命造反派大联合好得很
　　斯威士兰进步党欢呼上海革命造反派夺权胜利
    新华社开罗电　斯威士兰进步党二十五日写信给新华社开罗分社，欢呼“上海的一切革命造反派和革命群众组织实现了无产阶级革命造反组织的大联合”。
    这封信颂扬以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线是唯一的革命路线，毛泽东思想是“当代马克思列宁主义理论的最高发展”。
    信件说，中国的所有革命群众正在胜利地进行斗争，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的权，“这是毛主席交给他们的任务。帝国主义者和修正主义者必然惊慌失措，因为这是无产阶级和资产阶级之间的尖锐的斗争，是震撼今天世界的社会主义革命的一个更深刻的阶段。”信件还说，革命群众必须把无产阶级专政的命运、把无产阶级文化大革命的命运和社会主义革命的命运掌握在自己手中，这一点是十分重要的。
    这封信指出，帝国主义者和修正主义者歪曲和诬蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命的一切阴谋是注定要失败的。信中强调说：“毛主席说过：‘我认为，对我们来说，一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。’”
    这封信最后说：“毛主席正在胜利地领导着七亿中国人民从事社会主义革命伟大事业；这场文化革命粉碎了帝国主义希望资本主义在中国复辟、修正主义在中国出现的梦想。这场革命定将加速敌人的全面失败，给世界革命带来伟大的胜利。”
