Over the past few years, the cadres of a certain regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Wuhan have carried Chairman Mao's works with them, stepped out of their offices, and gone down to the companies. They have persisted in learning among the masses and using what they learn among the masses, in learning through practice and using what they learn through practice. They have not only transformed their worldviews but also promoted the ideological revolutionization of the entire regiment, gaining some experience in combining the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world.

Learning Among the Masses, Using in Practice

This regiment is one of the advanced units in the Wuhan Military Region for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The regimental party committee has deeply realized from years of practice in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works that whether cadres study well or not is not just a personal matter but a major issue concerning the direction in which thousands of people are led. To lead the regiment well and to combine one's own revolutionization with the regiment's revolutionization, one must carry Chairman Mao's works to learn among the masses and to use what is learned among the masses. They say: Learning among the masses is different from learning in the office, learning under bright electric lights is different from learning under a small oil lamp in a poor peasant's cow shed. Different environments and spiritual states result in different learning effects. Learning among the masses and learning through practice is not just a change in the learning environment but a fundamental way to truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and touch one's soul.

How did the regiment's cadres come to this realization? A few years ago, their study of Chairman Mao's works was limited to the office. Whenever they went down to the companies for point work, their study would be interrupted. Due to the poor connection between theory and practice, the study effect was not good. At that time, some people opposed work and study, study and the transformation of thoughts and improvement of work, considering it an insoluble contradiction. The regimental party committee believed that this situation could not continue and convened a party committee meeting to rectify the study style, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings on learning issues. Chairman Mao said: "We study Marxism, but many of us study Marxism in a way that directly contradicts Marxism. This means that they have violated a fundamental principle that Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have repeatedly told people: the unity of theory and practice." He also said: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the masses of workers and peasants to truly learn it." "Reading is learning, and using is also learning, and it is more important learning." These teachings made them realize that to truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, one must make up one's mind to break away from all old frameworks and foreign dogmas with a revolutionary spirit, step out of the office, go to the masses, go to practice, learn from the masses, and be willing to be a small student of the masses, learning from the broad masses of cadres and soldiers at the grassroots level who love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and working hard on the use of what is learned. From then on, the so-called contradiction between work and study, study and the transformation of thoughts and improvement of work was resolved, and the study effect became better and better.

Only by Revolutionizing One's Own Thoughts Can One Promote the Regiment's Ideological Revolutionization

Carrying Chairman Mao's works to learn among the masses, how can one both transform the subjective world and the objective world? Their experience is: One must combine learning with one's own problems and the regiment's problems, but focus on learning with one's own problems; one must combine learning with ideological problems and work problems, but focus on learning with ideological problems; one must combine learning with the cadres in the office and learning with the soldiers in the companies, but focus on learning in the companies.

Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldviews is a fundamental transformation," "To be a good teacher, one must first be a good student." Over the past few years, the regiment's cadres have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works among the masses, all following Chairman Mao's teachings, putting the transformation of worldviews first. They say: Only by transforming the subjective world well can one transform the objective world well, and only by revolutionizing one's own thoughts can one promote the regiment's revolutionization. They believe that the higher the position, the more one should pay attention to one's own ideological transformation, and the older the experience, the more one should stand at the forefront of the regiment's revolutionization. Every time they go down to the companies for point work, they first tell the company cadres and soldiers: "The main purpose of coming is to transform thoughts, and I hope everyone will help me." They do not act like leaders, placing themselves among the broad masses studying Chairman Mao's works, persistently studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with the soldiers, using the "completely" and "thoroughly" standard to measure their own thoughts, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations together, and sharing their own experiences and feelings at the study-sharing meetings, accelerating ideological revolutionization. Regiment Commander Cheng Xishen is a cadre who has been tempered in harsh war environments. He feels that his current simple and frugal style of thought and work is not as good as before, so he brings this problem to the company and studies the "Three Constantly Read Articles" with the soldiers. Last year, during the year-end evaluation of the Four Good Companies, he had a stomachache and missed five meals. The company and battalion cadres advised him to move to the battalion for a few days of rest, but he insisted on not moving and persisted in completing the Four Good Company evaluation. Originally, the regiment's cadres who came down with him could replace him in organizing the materials, but he did not slack off and insisted on personally writing the Four Good Company evaluation report and the report on studying Chairman Mao's works, and had heart-to-heart talks with the company cadres, seeking their opinions, both tempering himself and promoting the company's work. They went to the masses to study Mao Zedong Thought, gaining a common experience: Do not be a "flashlight-style" cadre who only shines on others but not on oneself; be a "locomotive-style" cadre, igniting the fire, filling the steam, driving the masses' train forward on the track of revolutionization, advancing at full speed!

The Good or Bad of Cadres' Ideological Transformation Should Be Judged by the Masses

To combine the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world, the regiment's cadres, when they go down to the companies, dare to reveal their thoughts to the masses, giving their hearts to the masses, and letting the masses supervise themselves. The specific method is: publicizing the cadres' ideological transformation plans to the masses; solving some of the cadres' ideological problems among the masses; letting the masses judge the good or bad of the cadres' ideological transformation. They say: A thorough materialist is fearless, daring to reveal one's thoughts to the masses is a unique quality of communists. Covering up the dirty things in one's soul with a confidentiality stamp and locking them in a safe is not effective. One must dig them out, place them under the sun, and disinfect them. Whether one digs deeply or not, let the masses judge; whether one transforms thoroughly or not, let the masses approve. Political Commissar Zhang Youchen once criticized the Second Artillery Company improperly. The Second Artillery Company carried the burden of being "backward," and the soldiers had opinions about him. He believed this was a problem of democratic style and actively checked himself at the party committee meeting. Should he go to the Second Artillery Company to check himself with the soldiers? The party committee members unanimously agreed to go. Soldiers have shortcomings and can check themselves with the leadership, and the leadership has shortcomings and should also check themselves with the soldiers. Ideological transformation should not be divided between leaders and led. If one is not brave enough to correct mistakes among the masses, it is only because one is afraid of pain, afraid of ugliness, calculating personal gains and losses, and considering personal prestige. How can one transform one's worldview well? He went to the Second Artillery Company and made a public self-criticism to the soldiers. He also organized a big discussion with the Second Artillery Company cadres and soldiers on "How to be completely and thoroughly selfless for the people," inspiring the cadres and soldiers to consciously correct their shortcomings, and the company's appearance changed greatly.

The Process of "Five Together" is the Process of Transforming Thoughts and Connecting with the Masses

To combine the transformation of the subjective world with the transformation of the objective world, one must also be a good ordinary laborer, standing closely with the masses, breathing together, sharing the same fate. Chairman Mao said: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." The vast majority of the regiment's cadres are from laboring families, have been soldiers and grassroots cadres, recalling the bitterness of their families and classes in the old society, recalling the hard life in the war years, recalling their own growth and progress, deeply excavating the selfish thoughts hidden in their souls, arousing class feelings, and deciding to maintain the style of an ordinary laborer, ordinary party member, and ordinary soldier. Whether in the office or in the companies, they persist in being "five together" with the masses. They feel that "five together" is a bridge to the masses' inner world, participating in the "five together" process is the process of transforming thoughts, and the process of eliminating officialdom and closely connecting with the masses. The political department director, Keushan, went to the transport team to help with work. At the beginning, he participated in labor less and seemed to have something between him and the soldiers, still being a "leader" in the soldiers' eyes. He realized that talking more and working less unconsciously distanced his feelings from the soldiers, so he insisted on cleaning the horse manure and washing the horses in the stable every day, going out on missions. At the beginning, he was a bit embarrassed when he saw acquaintances on the street. He brought this problem to study Chairman Mao's quotations: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" He followed Chairman Mao's teachings, checking himself for not having put down his official attitude in his mind. Afterwards, he went out on missions more, and every time he passed the camp gate and the street, he stood tall with the soldiers, loudly shouting to the animals, working hard. In this way, he connected with the soldiers heart to heart, quickly understanding the weak links in the transport team's emphasis on politics, organizing the study of the "Three Constantly Read Articles," taking the lead in revealing thoughts, and inspiring everyone to consciously revolutionize. Originally, a few comrades in the transport team were not content with their work, realizing that doing a good job of driving and feeding horses was a concrete manifestation of serving the people of China and the world, "driving for revolution, feeding horses for revolution" became the common language of the transport team.

Because the cadres combined the study of Chairman Mao's works with participating in revolutionary practice, combining their own revolutionization with the regiment's revolutionization, the entire regiment presented a scene of dragons and tigers leaping forward. The entire regiment produced a large number of active cadres in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, cultivating a batch of Lei Feng-style Five Good Soldiers and "Hard Bone Sixth Company"-style Four Good Companies, and summarizing a batch of experiences in "how to use" (Chairman Mao's works) that are deeply welcomed by the soldiers. Now, a mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is vigorously developing in this new stage in the regiment.

Zhang Houda, the company commander of the Eighth Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hainan Island and a member of the Communist Party, is the leader of the Eighth Company in studying and applying the "Three Constantly Read Articles." He studies with the soldiers, shares with them, and often uses the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a weapon to do a good job of the company's political and ideological work. This is him telling the soldiers about the selfless story of Dr. Norman Bethune.

### 带着毛主席著作到群众中去学习  解放军某团干部坚持在群众中学，在群众中用，既改造自己的世界观，又带动部队思想革命化

    带着毛主席著作到群众中去学习
    解放军某团干部坚持在群众中学，在群众中用，既改造自己的世界观，又带动部队思想革命化
    新华社武汉八日电　几年来，中国人民解放军武汉部队某团领导干部带上毛主席著作，走出办公室，下到连队，坚持在群众中学，在群众中用，在实践中学，在实践中用，既改造了自己的世界观，又带动了部队思想革命化，取得了一些改造主观世界和改造客观世界相结合的经验。
    在群众中学，在实践中用
    这个团是武汉部队活学活用毛主席著作先进单位之一。团党委从多年活学活用毛主席著作的实践中，深刻地认识到，领导干部学得好不好，不仅是个人问题，而且是关系到把几千人引到什么方向去的大问题。要把部队带好，把自己的革命化和部队的革命化结合起来，就要带着毛主席著作到群众中学，到群众中用。他们说：领导干部在机关里学和到群众中去学是不一样的，在明亮的电灯下学和在贫下中农的牛棚里点着小油灯学是不一样的，环境条件不一样，人的精神状态不一样，学习效果也不一样。在群众中学，在实践中学，决不是学习场合的变更，而是真正触动自己的灵魂，真正把毛泽东思想学到手的根本途径。
    这个团的领导干部是怎样认识到这个问题的？几年前，他们学习毛主席著作局限在机关的办公室里，一遇到下连蹲点，学习就中断了。由于理论联系实际差，学习效果也不好。当时，有的人把工作和学习，学习和改造思想、改进工作对立起来，认为是一个难以解决的矛盾。团党委认为这种现象不能继续下去，便召开党委会，整顿学风，反复学习了毛主席有关学习问题的论述。毛主席说：“我们学的是马克思主义，但是我们中的许多人，他们学马克思主义的方法是直接违反马克思主义的。这就是说，他们违背了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林所谆谆告诫人们的一条基本原则：理论和实际统一。”又说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”“读书是学习，使用也是学习，而且是更重要的学习。”这些教导使他们认识到，要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，必须下定决心，以革命精神，打破一切旧框框和洋教条，走出办公室，到群众中去，到实践中去，拜群众为师，甘当群众的小学生，向无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想的广大基层干部战士学习，在用字上狠下功夫。从此所谓工作与学习的矛盾、学习和改造思想、改进工作的矛盾迎刃而解了，学习效果也越来越大。
    只有自己思想革命化，才能带动部队思想革命化
    带着毛主席著作到群众中去学，怎样才能既改造主观世界，又改造客观世界？他们的体会是：必须把带着自己的问题学与带着部队的问题学结合起来，但是要以带着自己的问题学为主；必须把带着思想问题学与带着工作问题学结合起来，但是要以带着思想问题学为主；必须把同机关干部一起学和下连队同战士一起学结合起来，但是要以下连队学为主。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”，“要作好先生，首先要作好学生。”几年来，这个团的领导干部在群众中活学活用毛主席著作，都遵循毛主席的教导，把改造世界观放在首位。他们说：只有改造好主观世界，才能改造好客观世界，只有自己思想革命化，才能带动部队革命化。他们认为，职位越高，越应该重视自己的思想改造，资格越老，越应该站在部队革命化的排头。他们每次下连蹲点，首先向连队干部战士表明：“来的主要目的是改造思想，希望大家多帮助。”不以领导干部自居，把自己置身于广大群众学习毛主席著作伟大运动之中，坚持和战士一起学习“老三篇”，用“完全”、“彻底”的尺子量自己的思想，一起朗诵毛主席语录，一起在讲用会上谈自己的心得体会，加速思想革命化。团长成喜臣是经受过艰苦战争环境锻炼的干部，他觉得现在自己艰苦朴素的思想作风不如过去了，便带着这个问题到连队和战士一起学“老三篇”。前年年终他参加连队四好总评。胃疼复发，有五餐没有吃好饭，营连干部劝他搬到营部休息几天，他坚决不搬，一直坚持把四好总评搞完。本来和他一起下连的团机关干部可以代替他整理材料，但他不偷懒，坚持亲自动手写了四好总评报告和学习毛主席著作报告，并和连队干部逐个谈心，征求意见，既锻炼了自己，又促进了连队工作。他们到群众中去学习毛泽东思想，有一条共同的体会：不做“手电筒式”的干部，只照别人不照自己；要做“火车头式”的干部，把炉火烧旺，蒸气鼓足，带动群众的列车，在革命化的轨道上飞奔疾驰，全速前进！
    领导干部思想改造好坏，要让群众鉴定
    为了把改造主观世界和改造客观世界结合起来，团的领导干部到了连队，敢于向群众亮思想，把心交给群众，让群众监督自己。具体作法是：把领导干部的思想改造决心计划向群众公布；把领导干部的某些思想问题拿到群众中去解决；领导干部的思想改造好坏让群众来鉴定。他们说：彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的，思想敢于同群众见面是共产党人独有的气质。对自己灵魂深处的脏东西，盖上保密戳子，封在保险柜里，是改不掉的，要把它挖出来，放在光天化日之下，消毒杀菌。挖得狠不狠，让群众鉴定，改得彻底不彻底，让群众批准。政委张佑臣有一次批评二炮连不当。二炮连背上了“落后”的包袱，战士对他有意见。他认为这是个民主作风问题，在党委会上主动作了检查。要不要到二炮连去向战士们作检查呢？党委成员一致认为，要去。战士有了缺点，可以向领导检查，领导有了缺点，也应该向战士检查，改造思想不应有领导与被领导之分。如果不敢到群众中去改正错误，无非是怕痛、怕丑，计较个人得失，考虑个人威信，怎么能改造好世界观呢？他到二炮连向战士作了公开检讨。并且和二炮连干部战士一起开展“为人民服务怎样才算完全彻底”的大讨论，启发干部战士自觉地改正缺点，连队面貌大改变。
    “五同”的过程是改造思想联系群众的过程
    要把改造主观世界和改造客观世界结合起来，还必须当好普通劳动者，紧紧和群众站在一起，同呼吸，共命运。毛主席说：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”这个团的领导干部绝大多数是劳动人民出身，当过战士和基层干部，通过回忆旧社会的家庭苦和阶级苦，回忆战争年代的艰苦生活，回忆个人的成长和进步，狠挖隐藏在灵魂深处的私心杂念，激发了阶级感情，决心保持普通劳动者、普通党员、普通一兵的本色。无论是在机关还是在连队，坚持和群众“五同”。他们体会到“五同”是通往群众内心世界的桥梁，参加“五同”的过程，就是改造思想的过程，就是打掉官气密切联系群众的过程。政治处主任寇山到运输队帮助工作，开始参加劳动少，和战士好像隔着一层什么东西似的，在战士心目中仍然是个“首长”。他意识到动嘴多，动手少，无形之中和战士的感情疏远了，便坚持天天到马厩和战士一起打扫马粪，刷洗马匹，出车执行任务。开始车过大街碰到熟人有点不好意思。他带着这个问题学习了毛主席语录：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”他遵循毛主席的教导，检查自己还没有从思想上放下官架子。以后出车更多了，每逢出营门，过大街，和战士一样挺起胸膛，大声吆喝牲口，干的很起劲。这样和战士心连心了，很快了解到运输队突出政治的薄弱环节，组织学习“老三篇”，带头亮思想，启发了大家自觉革命。原来在运输队不安心工作的少数同志，认识到做好赶车喂马的工作，就是为中国和世界人民服务的具体表现，“为革命赶车，为革命喂马”，成了运输队的共同语言。
    由于领导干部把学习毛主席著作和参加革命实践结合了起来，把自己的革命化和部队革命化结合了起来，整个部队出现了龙腾虎跃的局面。全团涌现出大批活学活用毛主席著作的积极分子，培养出一批雷锋式的五好战士和“硬骨头六连”式的四好连队，并总结出一批深受战士欢迎的“怎样用”（毛主席著作）的经验。现在，一个向新阶段迈进的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动正在这个团蓬勃发展。
