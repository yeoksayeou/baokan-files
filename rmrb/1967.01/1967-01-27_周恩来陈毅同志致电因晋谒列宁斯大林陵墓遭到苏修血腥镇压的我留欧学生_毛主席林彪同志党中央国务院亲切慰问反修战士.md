	Zhou Enlai and Chen Yi sent a telegram on January 26 to Chinese students in Europe who were brutally suppressed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique for visiting the mausoleums of Lenin and Stalin. They represented the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, the Party Central Committee, and the State Council, extending warm greetings to them. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	To the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, via all students returning to China through Moscow:

	Dear comrades,

	We represent the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, the Party Central Committee, and the State Council, extending warm greetings to you.

	When you visited the mausoleums of Lenin and Stalin, you were brutally suppressed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique. You remained fearless in the face of danger, persisted in your struggle, and passed a severe test of international class struggle. This fully demonstrates the heroic spirit of the new generation of Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought. You are truly Chairman Mao's good students.

	We eagerly await your victorious return—you, the brave anti-revisionist fighters!

	Salute to the fighters of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Zhou Enlai
	Chen Yi

	January 26, 1967
