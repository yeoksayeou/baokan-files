Our great leader Chairman Mao proposed the battle cry of "mass unity" more than forty years ago.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, without the great unity of the revolutionary masses, without a mighty army of the proletarian cultural revolution, it is unimaginable to seize back the party power, state power, and economic power from the hands of those in power who are taking the capitalist road.

Unity is principled unity, unity based on Mao Zedong Thought, unity that seeks common ground while reserving differences under the premise of a common direction.

Unity must be clear-cut, not a hodgepodge of all sorts, not seeking quantity or collecting junk. We must not unite with the enemy, nor with those who are wolves in sheep's clothing. We must not unite with those who stubbornly cling to "royalism," do not surrender to the truth, and are skilled in covering up, patching up, and changing their appearance.

On the issue of unity, there can be no compromise, no reconciliation, and certainly no concession.

Unity must be centered around the revolutionary left, uniting all forces that can be united. Only in this way can there be true great unity. Only in this way, when the situation changes, in times of great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization, in critical moments when internal and external enemies attack from both sides, and it is most difficult to discern the direction, can the revolutionary left—the backbone of the mass organizations—stand firm against all kinds of evil winds and keep the revolutionary organizations steadfast.

Unity is not just a formal unity, but a unity of revolutionary workers, peasants, students, cadres, and all revolutionary masses, communicating with each other, learning from each other, helping each other, and supporting each other.

Unity is a great struggle to break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Are you a revolutionary leftist organization? Then you must certainly subordinate minor issues to major issues, consider the overall situation and the interests of the whole, and be understanding on minor issues. You must actively and voluntarily unite with revolutionary rebel organizations. The victory of unity is the victory of breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness.

"The seas churn with waves of anger, and the continents shake with thunderous roars." The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent. The time for great unity has come. All revolutionary rebels should unite as quickly as possible!

　　我们要什么样的联合？
　　北京政法学院“政法公社”战士
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，早在四十几年前，就提出了“民众的大联合”的战斗口号。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，没有革命派的大联合，没有一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，要从走资本主义道路的当权派的手里，把党权、政权、财权统统夺回来，是不能设想的。
    联合，是有原则的联合，是在毛泽东思想的基础上的联合，是在大方向一致的前提下“求同存异”的联合。
    联合，必须旗帜鲜明，绝不是乱七八糟的大杂烩，绝不是求数量、收破烂。我们绝不同敌人联合，绝不同那些表面是人、暗中是鬼的家伙联合。绝不同那些“保皇”到底、不向真理投降，而惯于遮遮掩掩、修修补补、改头换面的顽固分子联合。
    在联合问题上，不能折衷，不能调和，更不能妥协。
    联合，必须是以革命左派为核心，团结一切可以团结的力量。非如此，就不能有真正的大联合。也只有这样，在局势发生变动的时候，在大动荡、大分化、大改组的关键时刻，在内外敌人夹攻、最难辨明方向的艰苦条件下，革命左派——这个群众组织中的中流砥柱，才能顶住股股妖风，使革命派组织岿然不动。
    联合，不是形式上的统一，而是革命的工人、农民、学生、干部和一切革命群众联合起来，互相通气，互相学习，互相帮助，互相支持。
    联合，是破私立公的大搏斗。你是革命左派组织吗？你就必然小道理服从大道理，从全局出发，从整体利益出发，在枝节问题上互相谅解，积极主动地与革命造反派组织联合。联合起来的胜利，也就是破私立公的胜利。
      “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”无产阶级文化大革命的形势一派大好。大联合的时候到了。一切革命造反派，应当尽快地联合起来！
