Dear Red Guards and Young Revolutionaries!

Among the People's Liberation Army units, there is a saying: "borrowing the east wind." What does "borrowing the east wind" mean? It means to treat the workers and peasants as teachers, to humbly learn from them, and to use social examples to educate the troops at any time and place.

In the past difficult years of war, the troops were almost always marching and fighting, and everywhere they could find living examples. The atrocities of the enemy and the sufferings of the people aroused the soldiers' intense class hatred, making them more determined to go to the battlefield, united in courage, and bravely fight the enemy. In 1950, when the Chinese People's Volunteers entered the Korean War, it was just like this. A volunteer soldier wrote in his first diary entry after going abroad to fight: "Today, the city of Sinuiju on the southern bank of the Yalu River has been turned into a sea of fire by the U.S. imperialist planes. The fire burning on the Korean soil lit up the waters of the Yalu River, and the smoke filled the sky above the Yalu River. ... Across the Yalu River, I saw a scene that made my blood boil: those innocent Korean civilians, escaping from the sky-high flames, supporting the elderly and carrying the young, rushed to the banks of the Yalu River, ... In that instant, although I did not see the ugly face of the U.S. imperialist invaders, I clearly saw their cruel hearts." In this diary entry, the volunteer soldier wrote a poem: "... The majestic call resounds on Mount Changbai, the blood boils in the soldiers' chests. I take a deep breath of the free air of my motherland, and with fervent feelings, I march to the battlefield. ... This time, I will not hesitate to shed my blood, and I will not return until I defeat the invaders." Look, such real-life education is so important to the soldiers!

Now, most of the troops are stationed in barracks, and education from society is even more necessary. Especially for some young soldiers, they were born in sweet times and grew up under the red flag, and have not experienced the class oppression and exploitation of the old society, nor have they gone through the stormy class struggles. Some of them do not even understand what class is, what exploitation is, and what class struggle is. Therefore, it is very important to give them more opportunities to experience hardships, see the world, get to know society, get to know the masses, and learn the good experiences, good thoughts, and good styles of the workers and peasants. Many units take advantage of marching or field training opportunities. Every time they arrive at a place, they organize cadres and soldiers to visit the masses, investigate hardships, and live, eat, and work with workers and poor and lower-middle peasants. Some even invite local old workers, old poor peasants, and local cadres to give reports to the troops and reminisce about hardships and sweetness with the masses. This is the best classroom for the troops to receive class education. Once, a certain unit of the PLA conducted field training with the poor and lower-middle peasants, practicing the "four together" and borrowing the east wind, achieving good results. The soldiers saw with their own eyes that even today, when production is booming, the poor and lower-middle peasants still practice frugality and careful planning, receiving a vivid education on hard work and perseverance. Discussing family history, village history, and commune history with the poor and lower-middle peasants strengthened the cadres' and soldiers' awareness of class struggle. Especially when the troops entered the village, the poor peasants immediately told the soldiers which family was a landlord and which was a rich peasant, asking everyone not to make mistakes or go to the wrong door. The poor and lower-middle peasants' clear class standpoint and high class vigilance also deeply educated the cadres and soldiers. With these real experiences, the leadership organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, focusing on Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, the people's army, serving the people, and hard work, greatly enhancing the troops' proletarian consciousness. The cadres and soldiers unanimously reflected: "Although the time was short, we indeed learned things that we could not learn in the barracks."

To learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, one must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, have a desire to learn, be willing to be a small student, live, eat, and work with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and build a deep class sentiment with them. Only by blending in with the masses can you make the masses know that you are sincerely serving the people and humbly seeking advice from the masses. Only then will the masses pour out their true feelings to you, making you benefit more. A certain company established feelings with the members while working together. Member Wu Huoxiang not only told everyone about his family's tragic experiences before liberation but also showed everyone the broken bowl he used to beg for food and the straw bag he used as clothes during the day and as a blanket at night. He also led everyone to see his new bed, new mosquito net, thick quilt, and new clothes, giving the troops a vivid class education lesson.

During marching, when passing through old revolutionary bases, in addition to organizing the troops to visit revolutionary relics, one can also invite local old Communist Party members, old Red Army soldiers, old guerrillas, and old cadres to talk about their past struggles against the enemy, and about the revolutionary predecessors' spirit of not fearing hardships and not fearing sacrifice. This is the best revolutionary tradition education for the troops. For example, the PLA Nanchang Infantry School organized students to march a thousand miles to the Jinggang Mountains for field training. In the old Soviet area, they visited and interviewed. In addition to visiting the places where Chairman Mao stayed in Jinggangshan and the revolutionary relics such as the slogans written by the Red Army in Maoping, Ciping, and Daxiaowujing, they also invited some old cadres and old Red Guards who persisted in the Jinggangshan struggle to give reports to the students, giving the students a profound revolutionary tradition education. This revolutionary tradition education is especially important for the younger generation.

To learn from the workers and peasants, one must also learn to conduct social investigations. This is the best method taught by Chairman Mao for learning about society and the masses. Through social investigations, one can comprehensively understand the advanced deeds of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants in their struggles against class enemies and natural disasters, as well as their production and living conditions. A certain unit of the PLA organized a social investigation team during field training and conducted investigations and interviews with more than 30 households of poor and lower-middle peasants in the area. They analyzed, organized, and summarized the rich materials obtained from the investigation and then introduced them at a full company meeting, giving the cadres and soldiers a profound class education.

### 行军中大借东风——访问工人、贫下中农，学习革命传统

    行军中大借东风
    ——访问工人、贫下中农，学习革命传统
    亲爱的红卫兵战士们，亲爱的革命小将们！在人民解放军部队里，流传着一句话，叫做“借东风”。“借东风”的意思是什么呢？就是要拜工农群众为师，虚心向工农群众学习，随时随地运用社会上的活教材教育部队。
    过去艰苦的战争年月，部队几乎天天行军、打仗，到处可以遇到活教材。敌人的暴行，人民的苦难，激发了战士们高度的阶级仇恨心，使他们更加斗志昂扬地走上战场，群威群胆，英勇杀敌。一九五○年，中国人民志愿军入朝作战时，正是这样。一个志愿军战士，在出国作战的第一篇日记中写道：“今天，鸭绿江南岸的新义州，被美帝国主义的飞机炸成了一片火海。燃烧在朝鲜国土上的大火，映红了鸭绿江的流水，浓烟弥漫了鸭绿江的上空，……。隔着鸭绿江，我看到了一场令人发指的情景：那些无辜的朝鲜和平居民，从冲天的烟火里逃出来，扶老携幼地奔向鸭绿江边，……就在这一瞬间，我虽然没有看到美帝国主义侵略军队凶恶的嘴脸，但对他们残忍的心肝却完全看清楚了。”就在这篇日记中，这位志愿军战士，写下了这样一首诗：“……雄壮的号声回旋在长白山上，热血沸腾在战士的胸膛。我再一次深吸一口祖国自由的空气，怀着激昂的感情走向战场。……此去我决不吝惜自己的鲜血，不打败侵略者我决不回还。”请看，这种实际的教育，对战士是多么重要啊！
    现在，部队多数住在营房，来自社会的教育更是不可少的。尤其是一些青年战士，他们在甜水里生，在红旗下长，没有受过旧社会的阶级压迫和阶级剥削的苦，没有经过急风暴雨的阶级斗争。有的甚至不懂得什么叫阶级，什么叫剥削，什么叫阶级斗争。因此，让他们有更多的机会经风雨，见世面，熟悉社会，熟悉群众，学习工农群众的好经验、好思想、好作风，是十分重要的。许多部队都利用行军或野营的机会，每到一个地方，就组织干部战士到群众中去，访贫问苦，和工人、贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动。有的还请当地的老工人、老贫农和地方干部为部队作报告，和群众一起忆苦思甜。这是对部队进行阶级教育最好的课堂。有一次，解放军某部在野营训练中，和贫下中农实行“四同”，大“借东风”，收到了很好的效果。战士们亲眼看见贫下中农社员在生产大发展的今天，仍然省吃俭用，精打细算，受到了活生生的艰苦奋斗的教育。和贫下中农一起谈家史、村史、社史，增强了干部战士阶级斗争的观念。尤其是部队一进村，贫农社员便主动告诉战士，哪家是地主，哪家是富农，要大家别认错人，别上错门。贫下中农鲜明的阶级观点和高度的阶级警惕性，也深深教育了干部战士。有了这些实际的感受，领导上又组织大家带着问题学习毛主席著作，着重学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争、人民军队、为人民服务和艰苦奋斗等方面的论述，大大提高了部队的无产阶级觉悟，干部战士一致反映：“这次时间虽短，但确实学到了在营房里学不到的东西。”
    向贫下中农学习，就要遵循毛主席的教导，要有求知的欲望，要有甘当小学生的精神，要和贫下中农同吃同住同劳动，和他们建立深厚的阶级感情。只有和群众打成一片，让群众知道你是诚心诚意为人民服务的，是虚心向群众请教的，群众才能把真实的感情向你倾吐，使你受到更大的教益。某连在与社员同劳动中建立了感情。社员邬火祥不仅给大家讲他一家在解放前的悲惨遭遇，还把自己解放前讨饭用的破碗、白天当衣服晚上当被子的麻袋片拿给大家看，又领大家看他现在的新架床、新蚊帐、厚棉被和新添的衣物，给部队上了一堂生动的阶级教育课。
    在行军中，路过老根据地，除了组织部队参观革命遗迹以外，还可以请当地的老共产党员、老红军战士、老游击队员、老干部讲过去对敌斗争的事迹，讲革命前辈不怕艰苦、不怕牺牲等英勇顽强的革命斗争精神，这是对部队最好的革命传统教育。例如解放军南昌步兵学校，曾组织学员千里步行，到井冈山野营。他们在老苏区，一边参观，一边访问。除了在茅坪、茨坪、大小五井，参观毛主席当年在井冈山住过的地方，以及当年红军写下的标语等革命遗迹以外，还请一些坚持井冈山斗争的老干部、老赤卫队员给学员作报告，使学员们受到深刻的革命传统教育。这种革命传统教育，对青年一代，尤为重要。
    向工农群众学习，还要学会作社会调查。这是毛主席教导我们的学习社会、学习群众的最好的方法。通过社会调查，可以全面地了解广大贫下中农同阶级敌人和自然灾害作斗争的先进事迹以及生产和生活等情况。解放军某部有一个连队，在野营期间，组织了社会调查小组，对住地三十多户贫下中农作了调查访问。他们把调查来的丰富材料，作了分析整理和归纳，然后在全连军人大会上作介绍，使干部战士受到了一次深刻的阶级教育。
