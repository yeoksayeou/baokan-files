The Soviet Revisionist Leadership Can Only Live by Spreading Rumors

Using Western Newspapers to Spread Rumors of China "Intercepting" Soviet Missiles Passing Through Its Territory

Attempting to Sow Discord Between China and Vietnam and Defame Our Country's Great Achievements in Missile and Nuclear Tests

New China News Agency, January 21st

Just as people around the world are celebrating the great achievements of the Chinese people, who, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are striving for self-reliance and have successfully conducted nuclear explosions, the Soviet revisionist leadership has, through Western newspapers, spread the vicious rumor that China "intercepted" Soviet missiles en route to Vietnam "for its own nuclear plans." They are attempting to defame our country's great achievements in missile and nuclear weapons testing and to besmirch the high international reputation of the People's Republic of China.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's anti-China rumors were spread through so-called "Eastern European figures" and "communist diplomats" to American and British newspapers and news agencies. In an article published on January 8th by the British "Sunday Telegraph," a special correspondent in Vienna quoted these "Eastern European figures" as saying that "the Chinese intercepted two Soviet SAM-2 surface-to-air missiles destined for Hanoi last spring" and "used or copied some of the advanced electronic navigation equipment" to carry out their own rocket plans. A January 18th report by the United Press International correspondent in London, in addition to spreading similar rumors about missiles, also claimed that China had "stolen" Soviet atomic secrets by taking advantage of opportunities when Soviet nuclear physicists were sent to China and Chinese students studied in the Soviet Union.

To sow discord and disrupt the great unity and fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam, and to cover up their own shameful collusion with U.S. imperialism in pushing the "peace talks" fraud and betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people, the Soviet revisionist leadership also had "communist figures" accuse China of "sabotaging" Soviet aid to Vietnam, making the weapons delivered to Hanoi "appear to be of poor quality and full of defects," and even claiming that China had "completely banned" the transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam.

Everyone knows that, to oppose China and sow discord between China and Vietnam, since last spring, the Soviet revisionist leadership, either openly or covertly, through Western newspapers or directly, has fabricated countless rumors against China. They first slandered China for "obstructing" the transit of Soviet aid to Vietnam, even spreading the rumor that China demanded payment in U.S. dollars for transit fees; then they defamed China for "selling" steel to the U.S. forces invading Vietnam, and so on. The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country and our newspapers have repeatedly issued comments, sternly exposing and refuting these despicable rumors of the Soviet leadership, making them look foolish and speechless. In their need to oppose China, they have recently resorted to spreading rumors again, secretly fabricating through Western newspapers the absurd myth that China "intercepted" Soviet missiles transiting its territory and "sabotaged" Soviet aid to Vietnam. The despicable tactics of the Soviet revisionist leadership themselves show that they have reached the end of their rope and can only live by spreading rumors.

Our country successfully conducted three nuclear tests last year, raising our nuclear weapons science and technology to a new level. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a rich fruit of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a heavy blow to the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and modern Soviet revisionism to collude and attempt to monopolize nuclear weapons, disrupting the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations. It is a great encouragement to the heroic Vietnamese people who are fighting against U.S. aggression for national salvation and to all revolutionary peoples around the world who are fighting bravely. It is a significant contribution to the defense of world peace. No amount of anti-China lies from the Soviet revisionist leadership can defame our country's great achievements in missile and nuclear testing. The 700 million Chinese people will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and create even more magnificent miracles. The Soviet revisionist leadership's repeated attempts to distort China's firm stance of resolutely opposing U.S. imperialism and resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, and to sow discord between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples' great fighting unity, will never succeed.

### 苏修领导集团只能靠造谣过日子　利用西方报刊散布中国“拦截”苏联过境导弹的谣言   妄图挑拨中越关系和贬低我国导弹核试验的伟大成就

　　苏修领导集团只能靠造谣过日子
　　利用西方报刊散布中国“拦截”苏联过境导弹的谣言
    妄图挑拨中越关系和贬低我国导弹核试验的伟大成就
    新华社二十一日讯　正当全世界革命人民齐声欢呼中国人民在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，奋发图强，自力更生，连续成功地进行核爆炸的时候，苏联修正主义领导集团竟通过西方报纸散布所谓中国“拦截”苏联援越导弹“用来实行自己的核计划”的无耻谣言，妄图贬低我国导弹核武器试验的伟大成就，诋毁中华人民共和国崇高的国际声誉。
    苏修领导集团的这个反华谣言，是通过所谓“东欧人士”和“共产党外交人士”之口，向美国和英国报纸与通讯社散布的。英国《星期日电讯报》一月八日发表该报驻维也纳特派记者的一篇报道中援引这些“东欧人士”的话，胡说什么“中国人去年春天拦截了运往河内的两枚俄国萨姆—2式防空弹道导弹”，“使用或复制了其中一些先进的电子导航设备”，“来实行他们自己的火箭计划”。美国合众国际社驻伦敦记者一月十八日的一则消息，除引用“共产党外交人士”的话散布关于导弹的类似的谣言外，还胡说什么中国利用过去苏联派核物理学家来华和中国派学生去苏留学的机会，“窃取了”苏联的原子秘密。
    为了挑拨和破坏中越两国人民的伟大团结和战斗友谊，为了掩盖他们自己伙同美帝国主义加紧推行“和谈”骗局，出卖越南人民利益的卑鄙勾当，苏修领导集团还由“共产党人士”出面，污蔑中国“破坏”苏联援越武器，使它们运抵河内时“看起来质量低劣，毛病很多”，甚至胡说中国已“干脆禁止”了苏联援越武器过境。
    大家知道，为了反对中国和挑拨中越两国的战斗团结，从去年春天以来，苏修领导集团或明或暗，或通过西方报刊，或直接出面，对中国制造了无数的谣言。他们始而诬蔑中国“阻挠”苏联援越物资过境，甚至造谣中国要苏联用美元“支付”过境费用；继而诽谤中国“出卖”钢材给侵越美军，等等。我国外交部发言人和我国报刊曾一再发表评论，严正揭露和驳斥了苏联领导集团的这些卑鄙的谣言，使他们狼狈不堪，无辞以对。他们为了反华的需要，最近竟然再次乞灵于造谣，鬼鬼祟祟地通过西方报刊编造出所谓中国“拦截”苏联过境导弹、“破坏”苏联援越武器的极为荒唐的神话。苏修领导集团这种卑劣的手法本身，就表明他们已经到了黔驴技穷的地步，只得完完全全靠造谣来过日子。
    我国在去年一年内成功地进行了三次核试验，把我国核武器的科学技术提高到一个新水平。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。这对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义相互勾结，妄图实行核垄断，破坏一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族革命斗争的阴谋，是一个沉重的打击，对正在进行抗美救国斗争的英雄的越南人民和全世界正在进行英勇斗争的革命人民是一个巨大鼓舞，对保卫世界和平是一个重大贡献。苏修领导集团的任何反华谎言，丝毫不能贬低我国导弹核试验的伟大成就。七亿中国人民将高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，创造出更加辉煌的人间奇迹。苏修领导集团一再玩弄的歪曲中国人民坚决反对美帝国主义、坚决支持越南人民抗美救国战争的严正立场，挑拨中越人民的伟大战斗团结的阴谋，是决不会得逞的。
