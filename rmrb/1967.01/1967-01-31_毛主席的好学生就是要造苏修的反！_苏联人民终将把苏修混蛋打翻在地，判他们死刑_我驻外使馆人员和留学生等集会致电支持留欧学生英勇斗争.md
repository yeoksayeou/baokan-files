Mao's good students must oppose Soviet revisionism!

The Soviet people will ultimately overthrow the Soviet revisionist bastards and sentence them to death.

Our embassy personnel and students abroad hold rallies and send telegrams to support the heroic struggle of students in Europe.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 29th, our embassies in Bulgaria, Poland, Algeria, and Finland, the Xinhua News Agency bureaus in Sofia, Warsaw, Algiers, Chinese students studying in these countries, and Chinese experts working in Cambodia have held rallies, sent telegrams, and written letters in recent days to express their warmest regards to Chinese students in Europe who have been brutally suppressed by the Soviet revisionist leadership, and to protest strongly against the Soviet revisionist bastards.

The entire revolutionary comrades of the Chinese Embassy in Bulgaria and the Xinhua News Agency's Sofia bureau, along with Chinese students studying in Bulgaria, sent a telegram saying: "Soviet revisionist masters, you dare to collude with a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in our country, dreaming of launching a counterattack against the revolutionary leftists of the Chinese proletariat. Let us tell you frankly, we are not afraid. The Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, fear nothing. In the past, the tsars bullied us, and the revisionists of Khrushchev also bullied us, but the Chinese people have never been afraid. Today, the successors of Khrushchev's legacy, Brezhnev and Kosygin, are also bullying us, which is a foolish dream. You have lost your sight and chosen the wrong target. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible, opposing China will not end well, and you will surely 'lift a stone to drop on your own feet.'"

The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy in Poland, the consulate, and the Xinhua bureau, the Chinese staff of the Warsaw Railway Committee and the Sino-Polish Company, and Chinese students studying in Poland were all indignant and outraged upon learning the news that Chinese students in Europe had been brutally suppressed by the Soviet revisionist leadership. They immediately held a rally to strongly denounce the fascist crimes of Soviet revisionism and firmly support the heroic struggle of our students in Europe.

The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy in Finland sent a telegram saying: "Your revolutionary rebellious actions are excellent. You are truly Mao's good students. ... Your actions once again prove that Mao Zedong Thought is invincible and unstoppable. You are our good examples to learn from."

On the night of the 27th, Chinese students in Algeria held a protest rally in Algiers.

After the rally, Chinese students sent a telegram to their fellow students in Moscow who had been harmed, expressing their warmest regards, and sent a telegram to the Soviet revisionist leaders Brezhnev and Kosygin, strongly protesting against this fascist atrocity by the Soviet modern revisionist clique.

The protest telegram said: "You bunch of counter-revolutionary ruling clique bastards: the broad revolutionary youth and people of the Soviet Union are firmly opposed to you. They will definitely rise up to rebel against you, seize your power, remove you from office, and overthrow you. Your end is near. Your bloody suppression of revolutionary students can only show that you are paper tigers, and only show that you are struggling in your death throes."

The entire staff of the Chinese experts working in the Cambodian plywood factory jointly issued a protest letter saying: "The more the Soviet bastards madly oppose China, the more they oppose the brilliant and powerful Mao Zedong Thought, the more their traitorous faces are exposed to the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the world. The lifespan of these bastards will not be long!"

The protest letter pointed out: "The day the Soviet people rise up in anger to rebel is the day these Soviet bastards are buried in their graves. See how long they can be arrogant! The great red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high over Red Square!"

When the acting charge d'affaires of our embassy in the Soviet Union, An Zhi Yuan, read the telegram of condolences from Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Chen Yi, our students in Europe raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Down with modern revisionism!"

    毛主席的好学生就是要造苏修的反！
　　苏联人民终将把苏修混蛋打翻在地，判他们死刑
　　我驻外使馆人员和留学生等集会致电支持留欧学生英勇斗争
    据新华社二十九日讯　我国驻保加利亚、波兰、阿尔及利亚和芬兰的大使馆，新华社索非亚、华沙、阿尔及尔分社，中国在这些国家的留学生以及在柬埔寨工作的中国专家，连日来分别举行集会、打电报和写信，向惨遭苏联反革命修正主义领导集团血腥镇压的中国留欧学生，致以亲切的慰问，并向苏修混蛋们提出最最强烈的抗议。
    中国驻保加利亚使馆和新华社索非亚分社全体革命同志以及中国留保学生在电报中说：“苏联修正主义老爷们，你们妄图同我国一小撮反革命修正主义分子相互配合，梦想向我国无产阶级革命左派进行反扑。老实告诉你们，我们不怕，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，什么都不怕。过去沙皇欺负过我们，赫鲁晓夫修正主义也欺负过我们，中国人民从来就没有怕过。今天，继承赫修衣钵的勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流也来欺负我们，这是痴心妄想。你们瞎了眼，看错了对象。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国七亿人民是不可侮的，反华是得不到好下场的，你们必将‘搬起石头打自己的脚’。”
    我国驻波兰大使馆、领事馆和新华分社全体人员，华沙铁路委员会和中波公司全体中方人员以及中国留波学生，在得知我国留欧学生遭到苏联修正主义领导集团血腥镇压的消息后，个个情绪激昂，义愤填膺。他们立即举行集会，严厉声讨苏联修正主义的法西斯罪行，坚决声援我留欧学生的英勇斗争。
    中国驻芬兰大使馆全体同志在电报中说：“你们的革命造反行动好得很。你们不愧是毛主席的好学生，……。你们的行动又一次证明，毛泽东思想是威力无比、战无不胜的。你们是我们学习的好榜样。”
    在阿尔及利亚的中国留学生二十七日深夜在阿尔及尔举行抗议大会。
    会后，中国留学生打电报给在莫斯科受害的同学，表示最亲切的慰问，并打电报给苏联修正主义头子勃列日涅夫和柯西金，最强烈地抗议苏联现代修正主义集团这一法西斯暴行。
    抗议电说：“你们这一小撮反革命统治集团的混蛋们：广大革命的苏联青年、苏联人民是坚决反对你们的。他们一定会要造你们的反，夺你们的权，罢你们的官，把你们打翻在地上。你们的末日就要到了。你们对革命学生的血腥镇压，只能表明你们是地地道道的纸老虎，只能表明你们在作垂死挣扎。”
    在柬埔寨胶合板工厂工作的全体中国专家联名发表一封抗议信说：“苏联混蛋们越是疯狂地反对中国，越是反对具有无穷威力的光辉的毛泽东思想，他们的叛徒嘴脸就越加在苏联人民和全世界革命人民面前暴露无遗。这些混蛋的寿命不会长了！”
    抗议信指出：“苏联人民愤怒地奋起造反之日，也就是苏联的这些混蛋们被埋进坟墓之时。看他们还能蛮横多久！马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗必将在莫斯科红场上高高飘扬！”（附图片）
