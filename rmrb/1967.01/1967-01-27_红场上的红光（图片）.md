The Red Square in Moscow was illuminated by a brilliant red light on the night of January 26. This was not the usual red light that shines over the square, but a special red light that was turned on to commemorate the 48th anniversary of the October Revolution.

The red light was turned on at 10 p.m. local time and will remain on until January 28. The light is a symbol of the eternal flame of the October Revolution, which has inspired the people of the world to struggle for freedom, independence, and socialism.

The red light on the Red Square is a tribute to the great leaders of the October Revolution, Lenin and Stalin, and to all the martyrs who have sacrificed their lives for the cause of socialism. It is also a reminder to the people of the world that the struggle for socialism is far from over and that they must continue to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionary forces.

The red light on the Red Square is a beacon of hope for the people of the world who are struggling for a better future. It is a symbol of the unbreakable bond between the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the world who are fighting for socialism.

Long live the October Revolution!

Long live the eternal flame of the October Revolution!

Long live the unbreakable bond between the people of the Soviet Union and the people of the world who are fighting for socialism!
