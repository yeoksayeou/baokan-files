Our great leader Chairman Mao always has the keenest insight into the progress of the revolutionary mass movement, guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from one victory to another with timely and powerful directives!

It was Chairman Mao who first supported the big-character poster by Nie Yuanzi and seven other comrades at Peking University, igniting the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; today, it is Chairman Mao who personally decided to broadcast the "Statement to All the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" issued by the revolutionary mass organizations of Shanghai, thus pushing the Cultural Revolution into a new stage. We railway workers will resolutely follow the direction of struggle indicated by Chairman Mao and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

Some time ago, trains in certain regions could not operate normally, and there were serious delays. This was entirely the result of a new conspiracy plotted by those who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line. Some factory and enterprise bosses who took the capitalist road, in order to divert the revolutionary masses' struggle against them, incited some people who did not understand the truth to leave their production posts, creating a tense situation in railway transportation. Some people also took advantage of the contradiction between large transportation volumes and inadequate transportation capacity to create incidents at stations and on trains, preventing train crew members from carrying out their normal work.

Under these circumstances, some responsible officials in the railway department played tricks, inciting train crew members not to go out on trains, creating stoppage incidents, and disrupting railway transportation. They attempted to strangle the Cultural Revolution, fully exposing their ugly faces of insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line and disrupting railway transportation.

Now, some deceived crew members, after reading the "Statement to All the People of Shanghai" and the editorial note in the People's Daily, have seen through these people's tricks and have begun to go out on trains. There is still a small number of comrades who have not yet awakened. We believe they will soon awaken and respond to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," actively returning to their work posts.

We must defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao's teachings to "grasp revolution, promote production," firmly guard our work posts, and ensure the normal operation of trains. We railway revolutionary workers are hard as nails, and we will not be swayed by the tricks of a handful of bosses who took the capitalist road. In the face of the difficulties they create, we will not yield. We will ensure smooth railway transportation. Every train that operates normally is a contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee supporting us railway workers, with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and the Red Guards on our side, those who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, no matter what new tricks or conspiracies they play, will not escape the fate of "making trouble, failing, making more trouble, failing again, until they are destroyed," as Chairman Mao said.

Victory belongs to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! Let those who attempt to block the train of history cry, for they will surely be crushed to pieces under the wheels of the rapidly advancing historical train!

　　我们铁路革命职工是梆梆响的硬骨头
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，总是最敏锐地洞察革命群众运动的进程，及时而有力地指导无产阶级文化大革命从一个胜利走向一个胜利！
    是毛主席他老人家最先支持了北大聂元梓等七同志的革命大字报，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火；今天，又是毛主席亲自决定向全国广播上海各革命群众组织发表的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，从而把文化大革命推向一个新的阶段。我们铁路工人坚决按照毛主席指出的斗争方向，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    前些时候，某些地区的列车不能正常运行，晚点现象比较严重。这完全是那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的人策划的新阴谋。一些厂矿企业走资本主义道路的当权派，为了转移革命群众对他们的斗争，策动一些不明真相的人离开生产岗位，形成了铁路运输的紧张局面。还有些人利用运输量大、运输能力不适应的矛盾，在车站和列车上制造事件，使列车乘务员不能进行正常的工作。
    在这种情况下，铁道部门的某些负责人，大耍阴谋，煽动列车乘务员不出车，制造停车事件，破坏铁路运输，企图扼杀文化大革命，完全暴露了他们的坚持资产阶级反动路线、破坏铁路运输的丑恶嘴脸。
    现在，一些受蒙蔽的乘务员同志读了《告上海全市人民书》和《人民日报》编者按语后，识破了这些人的阴谋诡计，开始上车工作。还有一小部分同志，我们相信他们也会很快地觉醒，响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的号召，积极地回到工作岗位。
    我们一定要捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，按照毛主席的教导，“抓革命，促生产”，坚守工作岗位，保证列车正常运转。我们铁路革命职工是梆梆响的硬骨头，绝不被那一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋所左右，在他们制造的困难面前，决不屈服。我们要保证铁路运输畅通无阻。我们每一列正常运行的列车，就是为无产阶级文化大革命贡献了一分力量。有毛主席，有党中央给我们铁路工人撑腰，有广大工农兵群众和红卫兵战士在我们这一边，那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，无论耍什么新花招，弄什么新阴谋，都不会逃脱毛主席说的“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”的命运。
    胜利属于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！让那些企图阻挡时代列车的螳螂们哭泣去吧，他们必定会在飞速前进的历史车轮下被碾得粉身碎骨！
