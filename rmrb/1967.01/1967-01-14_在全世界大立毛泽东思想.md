The peoples of the world have strongly expressed: In today's world, Mao Zedong Thought must be established. This is the "need of the people of all countries," this is the "need of the world revolution."

A friend from Burma, when quoting Comrade Lin Biao's statement that a country with a population of 700 million needs a unified thought, which is Mao Zedong Thought, said: "The nearly three billion people of the world in their struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries need a unified thought, a revolutionary thought, a correct thought, and that is Mao Zedong Thought." A friend from Mexico emphasized: "Without Mao Zedong's revolutionary theory, there would be no correct line to guide the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, to lead them to victory against American imperialism and its lackeys, and to build independent, free, and democratic countries." The Communist Party of Peru solemnly declared in a statement: "The touchstone to distinguish communists from revisionists is whether they support Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is against Marxism-Leninism, whoever is against Mao Zedong Thought is a counter-revolutionary." The Italian magazine *Linea* pointed out that at present, in the face of the rampant revisionism, "cherishing and supporting Mao Zedong Thought" is "a major issue directly related to the proletariat of all countries, especially the European proletariat." A freedom fighter from South West Africa expressed that Mao Zedong Thought "is our highest directive."

    在全世界大立毛泽东思想
    世界革命人民强烈表示：在当今的世界上，必须大立毛泽东思想。这是“各国人民的需要”，这是“世界革命的需要”。
    缅甸一位朋友在引述林彪同志关于七亿人口的中国需要有一个统一的思想，这就是毛泽东思想的指示时说：“全世界近三十亿人口在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”墨西哥一位朋友强调：“没有毛泽东的革命理论，就没有正确的方针来引导亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争，引导他们去取得反对美帝国主义及其走狗的胜利和建立独立、自由和民主的国家。”秘鲁共产党在一篇声明中庄严宣布：“区别共产主义者和修正主义者的试金石，就是看他是否拥护毛泽东思想。谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是反对马克思列宁主义，谁就是反革命。”意大利《方针》杂志指出，目前，在修正主义泛滥的情况下，“珍视和支持毛泽东思想”，“这是一件直接关系到各国无产阶级、特别是欧洲无产阶级的大事”。西南非洲一位自由战士表示，毛泽东思想“就是我们的最高指示”。
