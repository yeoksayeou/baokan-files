Revolutionary masses from various places warmly greet and highly praise the comrades of the "South China Sea Hero Ship." You are truly heroes of the Mao Zedong era. We must be as loyal to Chairman Mao as you are, and learn from your fearless spirit in fighting the enemy.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 5th: The crew of the "South China Sea Hero Ship" No. 1018 cargo ship, upon returning to the motherland, received enthusiastic greetings from workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres from various places. Many people expressed in their letters and telegrams of greeting that they would learn from the crew's fearless spirit in fighting the enemy, as well as their unyielding loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao, and their boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought.

The sailors of the Guangdong Provincial Maritime Department wrote in their letter of greeting: "Sailors of New China armed with Mao Zedong Thought dare to climb the knife mountain and dare to rush into the sea of fire. They are invincible by any force and unyielding by any difficulty. We New China sailors must be like you, unyieldingly loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and regard revolutionary interests as our first life. We live for the people and die for the people."

The revolutionary youngsters of the "Long March Red Guards" from the Dalian Maritime Academy, who walked 2,000 miles to Beijing for revolutionary linkage, enthusiastically praised in their letter of greeting: "In the face of the U.S. imperialists' ferocious armed provocation, you fear no violence, fear no sacrifice, and maintain the dignity of the motherland with your blood and life, boosting the morale of the revolutionary people and crushing the enemy's arrogance. You are truly heroes of the Mao Zedong era. Your actions have deeply educated us. We are determined to take you as our example, study Chairman Mao's works actively, and forever follow Chairman Mao in the great waves."

During their treatment in the hospital, the heroic crew members of No. 1018 received visits from responsible comrades of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Communications, as well as representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cadres from Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City. Many people presented the crew members with Chairman Mao badges and other souvenirs. Some Red Guards also performed skits and dances based on their heroic deeds to express their greetings.
