	China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announces Indonesian Deputy Military Attaché as persona non grata
	China's Ministry of National Defense's Bureau of Foreign Affairs strongly protests Indonesian military attaché's slander against China

	Xinhua News Agency, January 25th - A responsible official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in China this evening to inform him that due to the various improper activities conducted by the Deputy Military Attaché, Colonel Yonohartomozo, during his tenure, which have harmed the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Indonesia, the Chinese government has now declared Colonel Yonohartomozo as persona non grata and ordered him to leave China by January 30th.

	Xinhua News Agency, January 25th - A responsible official of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China summoned the Military Attaché of the Indonesian Embassy in China, Colonel Muhammad Hanafi Sutarakshana, this morning to strongly protest against his slanderous remarks made to an Antara News Agency reporter last December.

	The responsible official of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs told Sutarakshana, "We have seen the statement you made in Hong Kong published by the Antara News Agency on December 28th last year, and we are extremely indignant. Your remarks are slanderous and attacking the People's Republic of China, a serious act of hostility and opposition to the People's Republic of China, which is inconsistent with your status as a military attaché to China. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, I strongly protest against this."

	When Sutarakshana made his statement to the Antara News Agency reporter, he maliciously slandered our country, falsely claiming that "China has the intention to vie for leadership in Asian, African, and Latin American countries," and that "a group of Indonesian Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) fugitives have been sheltered by the Chinese government. They have received social and political protection and training to carry out 'criminal activities' against their own country," and so on.

	Sutarakshana's remarks are purely malicious fabrications and slander. When the responsible official of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs strongly protested in a righteous and stern manner, Sutarakshana was at a loss for words, in a state of panic, and unable to respond.

　　我外交部宣布印尼驻华副武官为不受欢迎的人
　　我国防部外事局负责人强烈抗议印尼武官污蔑我国
    新华社二十五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部负责人员今天晚上召见印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使馆临时代办，通知他说，由于大使馆副武官约诺哈特莫佐中校在任期间，进行了种种不正当的活动，危害了中国和印度尼西亚两国人民之间的友好关系，中国政府现宣布约诺哈特莫佐中校为不受欢迎的人，并限令他于一月三十日以前离开中国。
    新华社二十五日讯　中华人民共和国国防部外事局负责人今天上午召见印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆武官默哈迈德·哈纳菲·苏塔拉克沙纳上校，就他去年十二月对安塔拉通讯社记者发表对我国污蔑性讲话提出强烈抗议。
    国防部外事局负责人对苏塔拉克沙纳说，我们看到安塔拉通讯社去年十二月二十八日发表的你在香港的讲话，感到十分气愤，你的讲话是对中华人民共和国的污蔑和攻击，是敌视和反对中华人民共和国的严重行为，是与你作为驻华武官的身份不相称的。对此，我代表中华人民共和国政府向你提出强烈抗议。
    苏塔拉克沙纳对安塔拉通讯社记者发表讲话时，恶意中伤我国，胡说什么“中国有在亚非拉国家争夺领导权的意图”，“一批印尼共九卅运动逃亡者得到中国政府的收容。得到社会和政治保障和训练，以对自己的国家进行‘罪恶活动’。”等等。
    苏塔拉克沙纳这些言论纯系恶意造谣、污蔑，当国防部外事局负责人义正辞严提出强烈抗议时，苏塔拉克沙纳理屈词穷，狼狈不堪，无法回答。
