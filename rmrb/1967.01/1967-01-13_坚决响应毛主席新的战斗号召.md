Workers at the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory, upon hearing the broadcast of the telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to various revolutionary rebel groups in Shanghai, the editorial in *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine, and the *Urgent Notice* issued by the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 32 other revolutionary mass organizations, were filled with excitement. Cheers echoed throughout the factory. Many comrades wrote big-character posters and held discussions to express their overwhelming emotions. Below is a summary of the speeches made by some workers from the factory's revolutionary rebel faction at a meeting:

	Zhang Yan: The *Letter to the People of Shanghai* and the *Urgent Notice*, both decided by our most beloved Chairman Mao, as well as the central telegram and the editorials in *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine, are truly timely and correct. This is Chairman Mao's new battle call to us. Chairman Mao cares most about us revolutionary workers and supports our revolutionary actions the most. Whenever the revolutionary movement reaches a critical moment, we always hear Chairman Mao's voice and receive his most brilliant instructions.

	Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent! Our factory, like the rest of the country, has a growing and more spirited revolutionary rebel force. However, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is indeed a life-and-death class struggle. Those reactionary elements will not surrender voluntarily without a fight. Their counterattacks are becoming more cunning and hidden. We revolutionary rebels must not be complacent and must remain vigilant.

	Our factory's revolutionary rebels have already seized control of the enterprise's leadership. However, the financial power is not yet firmly in our hands. At the end of last year, the class enemy took advantage of this. They incited workers by saying, "The year-end is approaching, if you don't get a promotion, your money will be confiscated." Thus, a wave of demands for promotions began. This is a lesson. We must follow the latest instructions from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, firmly grasp all power in our own hands, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

	Liu Jian Guo: We fully support the *Letter to the People of Shanghai* and the *Urgent Notice*, both decided by Chairman Mao. A handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have previously used hard tactics to suppress the revolutionary masses and implement white terror. Now that the masses have rebelled against them, they are unwilling to give up. They are now using soft tactics, using money to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, attempting to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since late December last year, our factory has also experienced a wave of demands for promotions and benefits, incited by a few of these elements. The revolutionary rebels, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have exposed this new conspiracy in time.

	We warn these bourgeois masters that no matter how you argue or deny, the wind is what you released, the words are what you said, and the money is what you gave. The temporary chaos in our factory is what you caused. You owe the revolutionary masses another account, and the revolutionary masses will definitely settle it!

	Jin Tao: I am a young apprentice. Our rebellion against the apprentice system is not for the sake of increasing personal wages, but because these systems promote bourgeois "material incentives" and cultivate revisionism. Therefore, we must resolutely smash it! However, those stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line attempt to blind us with money and material goods, diverting our struggle. They think we young workers have little experience in struggle and actually want to target us. They divide the apprentices into three levels and six grades, giving some apprentices increased wages, trying to win over one side and suppress the other, attempting to incite the masses to fight among themselves, so they can avoid the struggle and watch from the sidelines. Their intentions are so malicious! We warn these people that we young workers read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and use Mao Zedong Thought to examine everything. We will not fall into your trap!

	Liu Zhen Xiang: During the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary leftists in our factory have taken control of the political and production power of the enterprise. The movement has been successful, and the production tasks have been completed better than in previous years.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a serious and intense political struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. Without the power of the proletariat, there is nothing for the proletariat. Without the political status of the proletariat, there is also no economic status for the proletariat. Today, the class enemy attempts to buy off the workers with "material incentives," aiming to disintegrate the workers' ranks.

	We workers have the farthest vision and the most steadfast fighting spirit. We must settle accounts with the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. We will not take a single cent more from the state, and moreover, we will resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, thoroughly smash economism, thoroughly overthrow and overthrow the handful of capitalist roaders and stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly uproot the roots of capitalist and revisionist systems.

	Yan San Gai: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own." Don't think that just because the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory is controlled by the revolutionary left, class struggle has ended. Whoever thinks the class enemy will be obedient is too naive. The apprentices' demands for wages are not completely stirred up by them? We revolutionary rebels must not be fooled by them. We must concentrate our firepower and launch a fierce attack on the capitalist roaders and stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and we must not let the cannon aim elsewhere.

    坚决响应毛主席新的战斗号召
    北京第二机床厂的革命职工，听到中共中央、国务院、中央军委和中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电，《人民日报》《红旗》杂志社论以及上海工人革命造反总司令部等三十二个革命群众组织发出的《紧急通告》的广播后，群情沸腾，欢呼声响彻全厂。许多同志纷纷写大字报，组织座谈，来表达无比激动的心情。下面是这个厂革命造反派的一些工人在座谈会上发言的纪要：
    张　岩：我们最敬爱的毛主席亲自决定发表的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》、中央贺电以及《人民日报》《红旗》杂志社论，真是太及时，太正确了。这是毛主席向咱们发出的新的战斗号召。毛主席最关心咱们革命工人，最支持咱们工人的革命行动。每当革命运动发展到关键时刻，咱们总能及时听到毛主席的声音，得到他老人家最英明的指示。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命的形势好得很！咱们厂也跟全国一样，革命造反派的队伍愈来愈壮大，斗志越来越旺盛。但是，无产阶级文化大革命，毕竟是一场你死我活的阶级大搏斗，那些反动家伙绝不会自动投降，不来它几个回合是不行的。他们的反扑更加狡猾，更加隐蔽了。我们革命造反派，绝不能麻痹大意，千万要提高警惕。
    咱们厂的革命造反派，早就把企业的领导权夺过来了。但是财权还不是牢牢地掌握在咱们手里。去年年底，就叫阶级敌人钻了空子。他们煽动工人说：“年关到了，你们再不升级，钱就要上交了。”于是，就闹起了一股升级风。这是个教训。我们一定要遵照毛主席党中央的最新指示，把一切权力紧紧掌握在自己手里，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    刘建国：毛主席亲自决定发表的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，我们一千个拥护，一万个支持。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，过去用硬的一手来压革命群众，实行白色恐怖。群众起来造了他们的反，他们死不甘心。现在又使出了软的一手，用金钱来腐蚀革命群众的革命意志，妄图扼杀无产阶级文化大革命运动。咱们厂从去年十二月下旬开始，在他们一小撮人的挑动下，也刮了一阵闹升级、闹福利的歪风。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派，识破了这个新阴谋，及时加以揭露。
    咱们警告这些资产阶级老爷们，不管你们怎么狡辩，怎么抵赖，风是你们放的，话是你们说的，钱是你们发的，我厂出现一度混乱局面是你们造成的。你们又欠下了革命群众一笔账，革命群众是一定要算的！
    金涛：我是个青年学员。我们造学徒制度的反，绝不是为了个人增加多少工资，而是因为这些制度搞的是资产阶级的“物质刺激”，是培养修正主义，所以我们才坚决要砸烂它！可是那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，企图用金钱物质来蒙住我们的眼睛，转移我们的斗争方向。
    他们以为咱们青年工人斗争经验少，竟然想在咱们身上开刀。他们把学员分成三级六等，给一部分学员增发工资，拉拢一派，打击一派，企图挑动群众斗群众，企图使咱们内部吵起来，他们好逃避斗争，坐山观虎斗。他们用心多么毒辣！正告这些人，我们青年工人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，用毛泽东思想来检验一切，绝不会上你们的圈套！
    刘振祥：文化大革命当中，咱们工厂的革命左派，掌握了企业的政治、生产大权，运动搞得好，生产任务也完成得比历年都好。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一场严肃紧张的政治斗争。毛主席教导我们，革命的根本问题是政权问题。没有无产阶级的政权，就没有无产阶级的一切。没有无产阶级政治上的地位，也就没有无产阶级经济上的地位。今天，阶级敌人企图用“物质刺激”来收买工人，目的是为了瓦解工人队伍。
    我们工人阶级目光最远大，斗志最坚定。我们一定要跟党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派算账。咱们绝不能多要国家一分钱，不光这样，还要坚决响应党中央、毛主席的号召，彻底粉碎经济主义，彻底斗垮斗倒一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，彻底挖掉资本主义、修正主义制度的根子。
    阎三改：毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”别以为咱们机床二厂由革命左派掌了权，阶级斗争就没有了。谁要认为阶级敌人会老实，谁就太天真了。学员闹工资，不就完全是他们挑起来的吗？咱们革命造反派绝不能上他们的当。咱们要集中火力，猛轰走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，不能把炮口朝别处引。
