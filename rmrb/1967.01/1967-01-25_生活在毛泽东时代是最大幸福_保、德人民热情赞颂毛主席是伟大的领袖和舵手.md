The people of Bulgaria and the German Democratic Republic have recently sent letters or New Year's greetings to the Chinese people, expressing their boundless love and respect for the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong. They highly praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is currently being carried out in a magnificent manner in China.

A group of Communist Party members from Bulgaria wrote in a letter: "We sincerely wish the great Chinese people and Comrade Mao Zedong all the best. We Bulgarian Communist Party members—Marxist-Leninists firmly believe that the cause of the Chinese Communist Party, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is correct. We have seen our true leader. Because a leader as talented as Mao Zedong cannot belong to just one nation, but to the entire world communist movement. The eyes of all pure communists are focused on you, on the great Chinese people, on Comrade Mao Zedong. As long as there are the Chinese people and Mao Zedong, revisionism will not last long. All pure communists in Bulgaria stand with you."

A Bulgarian student wrote in a letter: "I am genuinely happy about the achievements of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have achieved one success after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We sincerely love Comrade Mao Zedong, who is your leader and teacher, and also our beloved leader. Because I live in an era when Comrade Mao Zedong works and creates for our freedom and the world revolution, I am very happy and inspired, and I am ready to make any sacrifice."

The letter also stated that the Bulgarian people are increasingly convinced that China is indeed the true representative of the socialist world, and this is increasingly evident in our lives. You should fully believe this. We are genuinely happy about your successful missile and nuclear weapon tests and extend our warm congratulations. Dear Chinese comrades, we are watching you, and we will always be with you, ready to do everything to realize Mao Zedong Thought. I will seriously study the works of Mao Zedong.

A Bulgarian citizen wrote in a letter, enthusiastically congratulating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The letter also said: We are proud of the great Chinese people and the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong. Let the thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong shine on the Bulgarian people, so that the Bulgarian people realize that they must rely on themselves to liberate their destiny and achieve freedom.

A worker from the German Democratic Republic wrote in a letter, enthusiastically praising the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He stated: "I will never join the clamor against the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong, nor will I support such clamor. I am always ready to prevent the People's Republic of China from being defamed."

Another worker wrote on a New Year's greeting card: "In the name of the German people, I pay sincere revolutionary greetings to the hope of the world proletariat—dear Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese people."

A medical worker wrote in a letter: "I extend my congratulations to the entire Chinese people under the leadership of the tested helmsman and beloved leader Comrade Mao Zedong."

A farmer wrote in a congratulatory letter: "We, supporters of communist ideology, extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese people, wishing the great leader of the Chinese people, our comrade Mao Zedong, eternal life."

A retired old worker carefully wrote in Chinese on the envelope of a congratulatory letter: "Long live Chairman Mao!"
