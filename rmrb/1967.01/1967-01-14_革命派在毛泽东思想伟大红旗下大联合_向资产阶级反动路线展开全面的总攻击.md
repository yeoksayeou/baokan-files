Revolutionaries across the country have enthusiastically hailed the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, as well as the January 12 editorial in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, and the emergency notice from 32 revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai. They see these as the first thunderclap of victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in 1967, signaling the start of a new offensive to thoroughly defeat the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. They have vowed to resolutely respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, to achieve great unity among the revolutionary organizations of the proletariat, to seize the revolution and promote production, to thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist economicism, to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and to firmly grasp the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy.

Revolutionary mass organizations and the broad revolutionary masses in various places have also enthusiastically expressed their determination to learn from the Shanghai revolutionary rebels who have high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and stood firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

In cities like Jinan, Nanjing, Hefei, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, and Nanchang, broad revolutionary masses have enthusiastically welcomed the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, editorial, and the emergency notice. Over the past two days, revolutionary rebel organizations in various places have held mobilization meetings, discussions, and forums, angrily exposing the counter-revolutionary crimes of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and stubbornly insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line in their new counterattack. In Jinan, revolutionary workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, and cadres held a mobilization meeting on the 13th to launch a total offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line. They enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great call, urgently mobilized, and resolutely opposed economicism, smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. The comrades of the "December 3" Revolutionary Link-up of the Nanjing Public Transportation Company of the Red Guard Headquarters of Jiangsu Province studied documents while taking action. Many revolutionary workers were outraged by the recent tricks of a handful of stubborn elements in the company who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line, issuing various forms of compensation, bonuses, and subsidies, attempting to numb the fighting spirit of revolutionary workers and shift the direction of the struggle. They drafted an initial plan to oppose economicism and smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line overnight, stipulating that revolutionary rebels must supervise the expenditure of funds, and any improper expenditures must be strictly prohibited. A certain bonus of over ten thousand yuan that had already been signed for use was also immediately controlled and not issued. The Red Guards of Fuzhou High School, Fuzhou Frontline Red Guards Headquarters, were very angry and pointed out that a handful of power-holders within the provincial and municipal committees who are taking the capitalist road and stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, are lavishly issuing bonuses and welfare funds, inciting workers and peasants to engage in "economic struggles." Their intentions are extremely sinister, aiming to sabotage the national economy on one hand, and to corrupt workers and peasants on the other, changing the color of our socialist country. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, expose the enemy's conspiracy, and thoroughly smash their counterattack, crushing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Recently, a handful of stubborn elements within the Fujian Provincial Committee and Fuzhou Municipal Committee who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, in order to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, suddenly gave the Fujian Frontline Workers and Peasants Red Guards 20,000 yuan. However, the Workers and Peasants Red Guards, tempered in great storms, saw through this evil plot and decided on the 11th to return all but the 500 yuan already spent on propaganda to the state. They stated that the Workers and Peasants Red Guards are tough in the Cultural Revolution and will also be pioneers in production, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's directive to seize the revolution and promote production, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The revolutionary rebels of workers, peasants, students, and cadres in Nanchang, who are launching a total offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line, saw the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram and the editorial in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, and their spirits soared. Workers of the Jiangxi Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory who are firmly guarding their production posts said, we resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to seize the revolution and promote production, determined to overcome all difficulties and do a good job in production, thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. The soldiers of the Revolutionary Rebel Team of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China heard the good news and said, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's series of wise directives are completely in line with the actual situation in Jiangxi Province. A handful of power-holders within the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, when the revolutionary people of the entire province rose up to expose their problems, they played tricks and incited and allocated funds, sending a large number of Workers Red Guards to Beijing to "complain," openly resisting Chairman Mao's directive to "seize the revolution and promote production," attempting to lead the masses' political struggle astray into the path of economicism, and attempting to corrupt the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses with material incentives. However, their conspiracy has been seen through by the broad revolutionary rebels, resulting in them lifting a rock to drop on their own feet.

After the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram and the editorial published by the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine on the 12th reached Harbin, Changchun, and Shenyang, the revolutionary rebels in these regions enthusiastically cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!" They excitedly expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, seize the revolution and promote production, oppose economicism, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Revolutionary rebel organizations in various factories and party and government organs in Harbin held meetings and mobilization meetings to seize the revolution and promote production. Red rebels in the banking system said, we must repel the economicist offensive, smash the tricks played by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, seize the financial and monetary power of the proletariat, and ensure the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Students and workers of the Revolutionary Rebel Team of Jilin Industrial University said: money can only buy those mediocre people, but it cannot move the true red rebels. To smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, they took over the financial department originally controlled by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, froze the cash, and seized the financial and accounting power in the hands of the revolutionary rebels. The Liaison Committee of the Revolutionary Rebel Corps Headquarters of the Shenyang Railway Bureau recently issued an urgent open letter to revolutionary rebels in the railway system across the country. The open letter said: railway transportation is the lifeline of our country's economic construction, national defense construction, and revolutionary big link-up. Ensuring the normal operation of railway transportation production is the important and glorious political task entrusted to us by our supreme commander Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. We must absolutely do it well and not do it badly, and under any circumstances, we must absolutely ensure the smooth flow of railway transportation and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Revolutionary rebels, workers, and cadres in Baoding, Taiyuan, and Hohhot enthusiastically welcomed the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, the editorial in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, and the emergency notice, unanimously agreeing that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's warm care greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary rebels and crushed the arrogance of the bourgeois reactionary line. Revolutionary rebel workers in Baoding said, the revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai are well united, well combined, and well cannoned, hitting the enemy's backbone and awakening those who were deceived. We broad revolutionary rebels must unite and thoroughly smash the new tricks and new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Nineteen revolutionary organizations, including the Shanxi Provincial Workers' Union, the Taiyuan City Workers' Red Guards Headquarters, and the Shanxi University Red Rebels Liaison Headquarters, held a rally on the 13th to enthusiastically welcome the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, exposing and condemning the new crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. Everyone unanimously said: we must hold high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely repel the rampant offensive of the economicist tide, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Revolutionary rebels of various nationalities in the northwestern region of the motherland enthusiastically welcomed the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, the editorial in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, and the emergency notice. Revolutionary rebels of various nationalities in Xining, Yinchuan, Urumqi, and the Ili Valley all braved the cold to hold celebratory parades. In Yinchuan, workers of the cargo department of the Yinchuan Branch of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau said, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, attempt to use economic welfare to shift the direction of the struggle and soften the fighting spirit of the working class, which is absolutely impossible. Workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will definitely persist in the struggle and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They guaranteed to maintain the attitude of masters of the state, insist on eight-hour work, achieve fast loading and unloading, and ensure the smooth flow of railway transportation. In Urumqi, various revolutionary rebel combat organizations of workers in the Xinjiang First Agricultural Machinery Factory united to establish the preparatory committee of the factory-wide revolutionary rebel committee on the day after the telegram and editorial were broadcast, and issued a notice, stating their determination to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, seize the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and seize the destiny of production and work. In Lanzhou, a responsible person of the Workers' United Front of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Lanzhou Refining Plant said: we rose in rebellion, not for promotion, not for wealth. We are completely for the revolution, to defend the Party Central Committee, to defend Chairman Mao, to defend Mao Zedong Thought. We, the working class, are the masters of the state, the pioneers of the cultural revolution, and the creators of social wealth. We cannot stand by and watch the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line sabotage the cultural revolution, nor can we stand by and watch the state funds being wantonly squandered by a handful of bad elements. We enthusiastically support the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram and resolutely support the emergency notice of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, determined to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, seize the revolution and promote production, and achieve dual victories in revolution and production.

Revolutionary rebel workers, revolutionary teachers and students, and Red Guards in the southwestern region, after hearing the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, had an unprecedented surge in revolutionary rebel spirit. They said, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao timely pointed out the direction for us revolutionaries, making us see clearly. We must unite, resolutely smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards in Kunming expressed their determination to build a revolutionary rebel combat collective with Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, they will go to factories and countryside to combine with workers and peasants, unite with all revolutionary rebels, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Nine revolutionary rebel organizations in the Chongqing Steel Plant area responded to the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, issuing an appeal to the revolutionary workers in the Chongqing Steel Plant area. The appeal pointed out: revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the hard bones of the proletariat. In the past, we did not yield under the brutal persecution of reactionary forces, and now we will not bow our heads under the sugar-coated bullets. The appeal called on revolutionary workers to smash the enemy's new tricks and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Chongqing Steel Plant area to a more magnificent and glorious new height! More than 20 revolutionary mass organizations, including the Mao Zedong Thought Red Workers Combat Team in Guiyang, jointly held a mobilization meeting on the 12th, calling on revolutionary workers to launch a total offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In Lhasa, in the afternoon of the 13th, the Lhasa Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters from the capital to Tibet, representing more than 100 revolutionary rebel organizations, held a "Learn from the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels, Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line Mobilization Meeting." Representatives of various revolutionary rebel organizations spoke at the meeting, expressing their determination to resolutely respond to the Central Committee's great call, learn from the experience of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, resolutely repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to victory, achieving dual victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. After the meeting, the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses held a parade.

After the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, the editorial in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, and the emergency notice reached Zhengzhou, many revolutionary rebel workers were extremely moved and said: this is the most affectionate care and strongest support for the revolutionary rebels in Zhengzhou! Our great helmsman Chairman Mao always points out the direction for us to break through numerous obstacles and advance towards the correct course at the most critical moments of the revolution! Workers of the Revolutionary Rebel Team of the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory said, just like many factories and mines in Shanghai, a handful of power-holders in our factory who are taking the capitalist road attempted to lead the fiery Cultural Revolution astray. They disguised themselves as "ultra-leftists," first using the provision of funds as bait to deceive a large number of apprentices to leave the factory and go north to disrupt production; later, they fired sugar-coated bullets, using wage subsidies, labor protection supplies, and living welfare to corrupt workers. Recently, they are doing things like issuing towels and soap, and preparing to increase the issuance of work clothes, giving as much as they want, etc. They attempted to use the despicable means of economic bribery to shift the direction of the struggle and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks. We angrily warn these reactionary elements, we revolutionary workers will not be fooled by some rotten money; we are determined to thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and swear to achieve dual victories in revolution and production. Twelve revolutionary rebel organizations, including the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards Eastern Red Sun Headquarters in Changsha, jointly held a revolutionary mass meeting on the 12th, angrily exposing the tricks and backstabbing of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, blowing the counter-revolutionary economicist wind, resisting and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution's heinous crimes. The representatives present unanimously said: we are determined to take the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat as the core, unite the majority of the masses, form an irresistible revolutionary torrent, and resolutely smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Twenty-one revolutionary organizations, including the Nanning Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, held a mobilization meeting in the morning of the 12th to thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. A responsible person of the Nanning Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters said at the meeting, the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram is the greatest support and encouragement from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to us revolutionary rebels. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao is always with us. He said, the situation in Guangxi is the same as in Shanghai. A few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are playing economicist tricks, inciting a large number of workers and cadres deceived by them to leave their production and work posts, launching a counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary line. We must take Shanghai's revolutionary rebels as an example, achieve great unity among the revolutionary organizations of the proletariat, high-hold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seize the revolution and promote production, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    新华社十三日讯　全国各地的革命造反派，热烈欢呼中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组的贺电、《人民日报》《红旗》杂志一月十二日的社论和上海三十二个革命造反组织的《紧急通告》吹响了彻底打垮资产阶级反动路线新反扑的进军号角，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线在一九六七年取得新胜利的第一声春雷。他们表示：一定要坚决响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，实行无产阶级革命派组织的大联合，抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎反革命修正主义的经济主义，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把无产阶级专政的命运、无产阶级文化大革命的命运和社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己手里。
    各地的革命群众组织和广大革命群众还热烈表示要学习上海革命造反派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线方面的光辉榜样。
    济南、南京、合肥、杭州、福州、南昌等地广大革命群众热烈欢呼中央的贺电、社论和《紧急通告》的发表，两天来各地革命造反组织纷纷召开誓师大会、座谈会、讨论会，愤怒地揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子进行新反扑的反革命罪行。在济南，革命的工农群众、革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部，十三日举行了向资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击的誓师大会，他们热烈响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，紧急动员起来，坚决反对经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。江苏省红色造反总司令部南京市公交公司“十二·三”革命串连会的同志，边学习文件，边投入行动。不少革命职工，对于最近公司里一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子大耍经济主义的花招，补发什么代金、奖金、补贴费等等，妄图麻痹革命职工的斗争意志，转移斗争的大方向，十分气愤。他们连夜拟订了反对经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的初步方案，规定革命造反派要监督经费开支，凡不正当的经费开支，坚决不准用；已经签字动用的一万多元的某项奖金，也已立即控制不发。福建前线红卫兵总部福州高级中学红卫兵们十分气愤地指出，省、市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，慷国家之慨，滥批滥发奖金、福利费，唆使工农群众搞“经济斗争”，他们的用心是非常险恶的，一方面想搞垮国民经济，另一方面还要腐蚀工农群众，使我们社会主义国家改变颜色。我们一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，识破阶级敌人的阴谋，大造他们的反，把资产阶级反动路线的新反扑砸个稀巴烂。前不久，福建省委和福州市委中一小撮顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，为了破坏无产阶级文化大革命，一下子给了福建前线工农赤卫军两万元。但是，从大风大浪中锻炼出来的工农赤卫军识破了这个罪恶阴谋，他们在十一日决定把这笔现款中除已开支的宣传费五百元以外，其余全部退还国家。他们表示，工农赤卫军战士在文化大革命中是硬骨头，在生产上也要当闯将，坚决贯彻毛主席提出的抓革命，促生产的方针，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。正在向资产阶级反动路线展开全面总攻击的南昌市革命造反派工人、农民、学生、机关干部，看到中央的贺电和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志社论，情绪特别高涨。正在坚守生产岗位的江西棉纺织印染厂革命造反派的工人们说，我们坚决响应毛主席抓革命、促生产的伟大号召，决心克服一切困难，把生产搞好，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。中共江西省委机关革命造反团的战士们听了喜讯后说，毛主席和党中央这一系列的英明指示，是完全符合江西省的实际情况的。中共江西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，在全省革命人民起来揭发他们的问题的时候，他们大耍阴谋诡计，煽动和批给经费，让大批工人赤卫队员上北京“告状”，公开对抗毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，妄图把群众的政治斗争引向经济主义的歧途，妄图用物质刺激来腐蚀革命群众的革命斗志。但是，他们的阴谋已被广大革命造反派所识破，结果，他们搬起石头砸了自己的脚。
