The People's Bank is the institution entrusted by the state to manage funds and is the heart of economic activity in a region. A small clique of capital roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, as they began to crumble politically, dared to direct their attacks at Chairman Mao's "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production" policy, launching a new economic offensive. They even put forth the reactionary slogan of "Pay on Sight, Spend It All," attempting to deplete the bank's reserves and create chaos in the national economy. Our revolutionary rebels in the bank promptly saw through their scheme, joined forces with revolutionary rebels across the city, and took decisive revolutionary action, engaging in fierce struggle with the small clique of capital roaders within the bank. This ensured that the national financial sector remained unscathed.

In recent days, our revolutionary rebels and the revolutionary masses in the bank, with the strong support of revolutionary rebels across the city, have carried out propaganda work, exposing the new schemes of the small clique of capital roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. Some of the masses who were previously deceived have now awakened and are resisting. For example, revolutionary workers from the Shanghai Lixin Ship Repair and Manufacturing Factory, the Shanghai Inland Navigation Company, and the 3516 Factory have all voluntarily returned the supplementary wages that had already been issued. A worker from the Shanghai Inland Navigation Company said as he returned his supplementary wages, "We cannot fall for the tricks of the capital roaders within the party." We believe that our revolutionary action of temporarily stopping the issuance of supplementary wages and welfare funds will gain the support of the revolutionary masses, ensuring that our socialist financial sector remains as solid as a rock.

    确保国家金融事业不受破坏
    人民银行是国家委托管理资金的机构，是一个地区经济活动的心脏。上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，当他们在政治上开始瓦解时，竟敢把矛头直接针对毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，从经济上来发动新的进攻，从而进一步暴露了他们的丑恶嘴脸。他们竟敢提出“见票即付，付光算数”的反动口号，企图把银行库存全部用完，造成国家经济混乱。我们银行的革命造反派及时识破了他们的阴谋，联合全市革命造反派，采取了断然的革命行动，直接与银行内一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派进行了激烈的斗争，从而确保了国家金融事业不受破坏。
    连日来，我们银行的革命造反派和全行革命群众，在全市革命造反派的大力支持下，开展了宣传工作，揭露上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的新阴谋。少数曾受蒙蔽的群众，经过宣传解释，已纷纷觉悟过来，起来抵制。如上海立新船舶修造厂、上海内河航运公司、三五一六厂等单位的革命职工，都自动退回已发出的补发工资。上海内河航运公司有的工人在退回补发工资时说：“我们不能上党内走资本主义道路当权派的当。”我们相信，我们暂时停止发付补发工资、福利费用的革命行动，一定会得到革命群众的支持，使我们社会主义的金融事业永远固若金汤。
