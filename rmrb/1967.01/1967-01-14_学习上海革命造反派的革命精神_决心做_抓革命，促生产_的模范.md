The revolutionary workers of various military factories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically endorsed the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai, and have resolved to thoroughly smash economism and crush the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: The revolutionary workers of various military factories of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with hearts filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, have enthusiastically hailed the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai, as well as the editorial titled "Oppose Economism, Crush the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" published in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, and the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and "Urgent Notice" issued by the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai. Everyone joyfully exclaimed that the telegram from the Central Committee and these documents mark the beginning of a new stage in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pointing out the direction of our struggle, and expressing the sentiments of revolutionary workers. Everyone expressed their determination to respond to the battle call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, learn from the shining example of the revolutionary rebel workers of Shanghai, and hold high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. With the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm and abundant revolutionary vigor, we will grasp the revolution and promote production, thoroughly smash economism, resolutely crush the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, achieving complete victory without retreat.

In recent days, the revolutionary workers of various military factories have listened to the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee and these important documents on the radio, and have been filled with excitement and high spirits. Many revolutionary workers braved the cold and arrived at the newspaper office before dawn to wait for the newspapers. Many people, after reading the telegram from the Central Committee, jumped and shouted in excitement: "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live!" They wrote big-character posters, put up slogans, published wall newspapers, and used loudspeakers to broadcast, widely publicizing this great joy. Many people also held discussion meetings, repeatedly studying and discussing these important documents. They said that the telegram from the Central Committee is the greatest support, care, trust, and encouragement from the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai and the revolutionary masses of the entire country. The "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" embody the revolutionary will of the working class to be masters of the country, fully in line with the wishes and fundamental interests of the people of the entire country, and we wholeheartedly support and respond to them. The revolutionary workers of a certain naval factory, after listening to the broadcast, held meetings to denounce the crimes of a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line who attempt to use economism to divert the direction of the struggle, sabotage the Cultural Revolution, and sabotage production. They declared that they would definitely smash this counter-revolutionary revisionist plot to smithereens. Many workers recalled the hardships of the old society and excitedly said, "We are revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We are forever loyal to Chairman Mao. A handful of reactionaries foolishly attempt to use the 'sugar-coated bullets' of economic benefits to corrupt our revolutionary will, blind our eyes, and seal our mouths, making us abandon the revolution and abandon the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a daydream! It is impossible, a thousand times impossible!"

Many revolutionary workers of military factories, while studying the telegram from the Central Committee and other documents, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." They carefully analyzed the current good situation of the Cultural Revolution and became even more clear-sighted and steadfast. The revolutionary workers of a certain factory under the General Logistics Department said, "Chairman Mao teaches us that reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. Anything reactionary, if you do not strike it down, it will not fall. Currently, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line are facing imminent collapse. Their new counterattack shows that they are making a desperate struggle. We must press on to achieve complete victory."

Many revolutionary workers of military factories said, "Grasp the revolution, promote production" is a major policy proposed by Chairman Mao. We revolutionary workers love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao the most. We will definitely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, oppose economism, thoroughly crush the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production." With the greatest enthusiasm, we will carry out the revolution, and with the greatest vigor, we will promote production, being both pioneers in grasping the revolution and models in promoting production. The revolutionary workers of a certain printing factory under the Guangzhou Military Region, after studying the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice," said, "Grasp the revolution, promote production" is an important policy to ensure the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is carried out to the end. Supporting or not supporting, implementing or not implementing this policy is a matter of principle, a major issue of whether to implement or not implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Stopping production can only make a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and those adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line happy. They are trying to use this trick to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, sabotage the Cultural Revolution, and sabotage production. We must smash their plot, insist on grasping the revolution and promoting production, and achieve a double victory in revolution and production. The second workshop of this factory has a relatively tight production task, and the third workshop immediately dispatched manpower to support it, creating a new atmosphere of revolutionary and production victories throughout the factory. Some workers of a certain factory under the General Logistics Department who were misled listened to the broadcast, read the newspaper repeatedly six or seven times, and excitedly said, "We were deceived by the class enemy, forgot Chairman Mao's instruction of 'grasp the revolution, promote production,' and left the production post. Just when we were lost, Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast these important documents nationwide, clearing our eyes and clarifying the direction of the struggle." They decided to immediately return to the factory, work with the revolutionary workers of the factory, take Shanghai's revolutionary rebels as an example, resolutely implement the policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production," resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, overthrow economism, thoroughly crush the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

    学习上海革命造反派的革命精神
    决心做“抓革命，促生产”的模范
    解放军各军事工厂广大革命工人，坚决拥护中央贺电，决心彻底砸烂经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑
    新华社十三日讯　中国人民解放军各军事工厂的广大革命工人，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的激动心情，热烈欢呼中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志发表的《反对经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑》的社论，以及上海市各革命造反组织发表的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》。大家欢欣鼓舞地说，中央的贺电和这些文件，标志着我国的无产阶级文化大革命开始了一个新阶段，它给我们指明了斗争的大方向，句句说到了我们革命工人的心坎上，说出了我们革命工人心里的话。大家表示，坚决响应毛主席和党中央的战斗号召，学习上海市革命造反工人的光辉榜样，高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，以最大的革命热情，以充沛的革命干劲，抓革命，促生产，彻底砸烂经济主义，坚决粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    连日来，各军事工厂的广大革命工人从广播里听到中央的贺电和这些重要文件，万众欢腾，斗志昂扬。许多革命工人冒着严寒，天不亮就赶到报社门口等候报纸。许多人读了中央的贺电，激动得跳跃欢呼：“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”他们纷纷写大字报，贴标语，出墙报，用扩音喇叭广播，广泛宣传这件大喜事。许多人还纷纷召开座谈会，反复学习和讨论这些重要文件，他们说，中央的贺电，是伟大领袖毛主席和党中央对上海革命造反派和全国革命群众的最大支持、最大关怀、最大信任、最大鼓舞。《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》体现了我们工人阶级当家作主的革命意志，完全符合全国人民的心愿和根本利益，我们一千个拥护，一万个响应。海军某工厂的革命工人收听广播后纷纷集会，声讨一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子企图用经济主义转移斗争的大方向、破坏文化大革命和破坏生产的罪行，他们表示一定要把这个反革命修正主义的大阴谋砸个稀巴烂。许多工人回忆了在旧社会的苦难，激动地说，我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的革命工人，我们永远忠于毛主席。一小撮反动分子妄图用经济福利的“糖衣炮弹”来腐蚀我们的革命意志，蒙住我们的眼睛，封我们的嘴，要我们放弃革命，放弃无产阶级专政，这是白日做梦！一千个办不到，一万个办不到！
    许多军事工厂的革命工人在学习中央的贺电等文件时，还反复学习了毛主席的语录：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”他们认真分析了当前文化大革命的大好形势，更加眼明心亮脚跟稳。总后勤部某工厂的革命工人说，毛主席教导我们，反动派决不会甘心于他们的失败。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。当前党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，已面临全面崩溃。他们的新反扑，正说明他们在进行垂死挣扎。我们一定要乘胜追击，夺取全胜。
    许多军事工厂的革命工人说，“抓革命，促生产”是毛主席提出的重大方针。我们革命工人最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。我们一定坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，反对经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，坚决按照毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针办事，用最大的热情搞革命，用最大的干劲搞生产，既做抓革命的先锋，又做促生产的模范。广州部队所属某印刷厂的革命职工，学习了《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》以后说，“抓革命，促生产”是保证无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的重要方针，拥护不拥护、执行不执行这个方针，是一个原则问题，是执行不执行毛主席的革命路线的大是大非的问题。停止生产只能使一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的人高兴，他们就是企图用这个阴谋诡计来反对毛主席的革命路线，破坏文化大革命，破坏生产。我们一定要粉碎他们这个阴谋，坚持抓革命，促生产，夺取革命生产双丰收。这个厂的第二车间生产任务比较紧张，第三车间立即抽出人力来支援，全厂出现了一派革命、生产双胜利的新气象。总后勤部某工厂一部分受蒙蔽的工人听了广播，拿到报纸反复读了六、七遍，激动地说，我们上了阶级敌人的当，忘记了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，离开了生产岗位。正当我们迷路的时候，毛主席亲自决定向全国广播这几个重要文件，给我们擦亮了眼睛，明确了斗争的大方向。他们决定马上返回工厂，同工厂的革命工人一道，以上海革命造反派为榜样，坚决执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针，坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，打倒经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，夺取文化大革命的新胜利。
