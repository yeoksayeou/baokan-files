Like other residential areas, the courtyard at No. 6 Hu Fang Road in Beijing is undergoing a significant transformation!

This is a courtyard known as a "dazhuangyuan" (large courtyard) in Beijing, housing dozens of families. Most of the residents are laborers, tricycle drivers, and their families. During this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the families in this courtyard have responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call to promote Mao Zedong Thought, launching a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. The great sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly in this courtyard, bringing spring to every corner and profoundly changing people's spiritual outlook and interpersonal relationships.

Liberation from Old Thoughts

Since liberation, the residents of this courtyard have continuously raised their political awareness. However, the old thoughts left over from thousands of years still poison people's souls. Many family members think only of their own children, spouses, and small families; they gossip about neighbors; and quarrels and arguments frequently occur.

In the wave of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the families in this courtyard have started a revolution in their souls.

Not long ago, on a sunny morning, they studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" together. An elderly retired worker, wearing glasses, read aloud to everyone: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by our Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is a people's army. It belongs to the people. Our responsibility is to the people. Comrade Norman Bethune, a member of this army, dedicated his life to the people's cause." ... The great leader Chairman Mao's teachings stirred everyone's heart, and people listened attentively, pondered deeply, and discussed in small groups.

A fifty-something woman, Wang Da Ma, always gets emotional whenever she studies "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Before liberation, she worked as a seamstress on the streets of Beijing's Zhu Market, enduring a long, hard life. She said, "Chairman Mao saved me from the bitter waters of the old society, and now Chairman Mao is helping me liberate myself from old thoughts. The old society was about private interests, the new society is about public interests. Following Chairman Mao's words, I understand that living is not just about oneself; one must serve the people like Comrade Norman Bethune to find true meaning." Although she is not in good health and her hands and feet are not agile, she still volunteers to help young women with their families when they go out to participate in the Cultural Revolution. She excitedly said, "As long as one has the thought of serving the people, there are opportunities to serve the people everywhere."

Studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has broadened the horizons of many people in the courtyard, and more and more people are concerned about national affairs and public matters. Now, many elderly people and women gather together, and their conversations are no longer about neighborhood gossip but about the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards, and domestic and international affairs. In the past, some people were unwilling to participate in public sanitation, but now they all volunteer to clean public areas.

The Thought of Serving the People Cannot "Retire"

The great Mao Zedong Thought has elevated the residents' thinking to a new level, producing a group of enthusiastic public-spirited "old activists" and "good family members."

Every month, an elderly man with white hair can be seen in the courtyard, carrying a small bag, collecting water and electricity bills from each household. This "volunteer bill collector" is the retired worker Chang Bo Ci. He hangs portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations in his room. He said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Seeing Chairman Mao, my heart is bright." After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he took the initiative to manage the courtyard's water and electricity, collecting bills from each household every month and then submitting the total to the relevant departments, saving everyone a lot of time. This old man reads Chairman Mao's works to the courtyard residents every Tuesday and Friday; every Monday and Thursday, he organizes street activists to study Chairman Mao's works together. In daily life, he is always ready to help others. The loader Gao Yu and his wife both work, and their four children are young, making it difficult to cook every day. Chang Bo Ci thought, "The neighbors' difficulties are also my difficulties, and I must help solve them!" So, he often goes to help the Gao Yu family with cooking and boiling water. When Gao Yu and his wife return from work, the fire is burning, and the water is hot, so they can start cooking immediately. The couple gratefully said, "With Chang Da Ye's help at home, we work with peace of mind. In the old society, it was 'sweep the snow in front of your own door,' but only in the great era of Mao Zedong can such good people and good deeds appear." The courtyard residents deeply respect this old man. Someone advised him, "You are retired, you should rest, why are you still so busy?" He said, "Although I am retired, the thought of serving the people cannot retire. Reading Chairman Mao's books every day and following Chairman Mao's words in everything, a person will never feel old."

Hospitality for Chairman Mao's Guests

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the daring, bold, and revolutionary Red Guards have left a deep impression on the families here.

Recently, the neighborhood committee assigned this courtyard to accommodate a group of out-of-town Red Guards and revolutionary students coming to Beijing. The families in the courtyard regard hosting Chairman Mao's guests as a great honor. They immediately mobilized, gathering pots, pans, and bowls, and bringing out their cleanest quilts. Many women worked day and night, taking turns to cook and boil water.

In the kitchen preparing meals for the out-of-town Red Guards and revolutionary students, it was hot and bustling. Women with many children also came to help. Those with more household chores during the day came to work the night shift. They were full of enthusiasm, serving the revolutionary young people diligently for several months.

They served bowl after bowl of hot rice and hot dishes to the Red Guards and revolutionary students. They also received letter after letter of gratitude from the enthusiastic revolutionary young people.

Among the women who worked hard for the Red Guards and revolutionary students, people particularly praised the worker's family member Yang Xiu Lian. She is the mother of six children and has a lot of household chores. She cooks for the Red Guards during the day and washes and mends clothes for her children at night, often busy until late at night. She said, "The Red Guards are Chairman Mao's guests, and we who live near Chairman Mao must treat them well, letting them eat well and sleep well."

"To treat Chairman Mao's guests well!" This is the common language of the entire courtyard families, also expressing their shared concern for national affairs and the Cultural Revolution.

A Class-Friendly Big Family

The residents of this courtyard have studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" over and over again. The great Mao Zedong Thought gradually unifies the residents' thinking, making the courtyard a big family of class friendship.

Fifty-three-year-old Aunt Sun Gui Lan was once a person who thought "if it doesn't concern me, I won't bother." After studying Chairman Mao's works, she happily said, "In the past, I thought it was right to only take care of myself and not bother with others, but now I know that is liberalism and individualism. Chairman Mao said that revolutionary people must unite, and all people in the world must unite. We who live in the same courtyard, class brothers and sisters, must unite even more." She saw that some "dual-income families" needed to use the stove to cook when they returned home, so she helped them light the fire in advance. Although she is not in good health, she often gets up early to sweep the corridors and alleys, keeping the courtyard clean. She said, "Without studying Chairman Mao's works, one's brain is dull and full of problems. After studying Chairman Mao's works, doing a little good for the collective makes one's heart feel more comfortable than taking any elixir."

Class friendship is also reflected in mutual concern and help in politics and ideology.

In a corner of the courtyard, Yang Xiu Lian and Wang Shu Zhen are having a friendly conversation. They are studying a quotation from Chairman Mao together.

"What is serving the people wholeheartedly? Comrade Norman Bethune came from afar to China, dedicating his life to help the Chinese people seek liberation, truly selfless and dedicated to others. This is serving the people wholeheartedly..." Yang Xiu Lian enthusiastically shared her study insights.

"How do we serve the people wholeheartedly in this courtyard? If there is work, we must go ahead of others, like Comrade Norman Bethune, taking extreme responsibility..." Wang Shu Zhen added thoughtfully.

Yang Xiu Lian herself is illiterate, but she has a deep class feeling for Chairman Mao's works. She asks her children to teach her, with unwavering willpower, memorizing many of Chairman Mao's quotations, carefully pondering the meaning of every word Chairman Mao said. She saw that family member Wang Shu Zhen had difficulty studying Chairman Mao's quotations, so she took the initiative to help. Mao Zedong Thought connects these two housewives, uniting them.

The residents of this courtyard said with boundless excitement, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. With the red sun rising in our hearts, everything in the courtyard has changed." Indeed, the great Mao Zedong Thought shines brilliantly in this courtyard. (By a reporter from this newspaper)

"Red Guards are Chairman Mao's guests. We who live near Chairman Mao must treat them well, letting them eat well and sleep well."

"Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. Seeing Chairman Mao, my heart is bright."

### 心中升起红太阳　居民大院变新样

    心中升起红太阳　居民大院变新样
    像其他的居民聚居区的处所一样，北京市虎坊路六号大院，正在经历一场重大的变化！
    这里是北京人通称为“大杂院”的一个居民大院，聚居着几十户人家。大都是搬运工人、三轮车工人和他们的家属。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，这个院子里的家属们响应林彪同志大立毛泽东思想的号召，开展了一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。伟大的毛泽东思想的阳光，照得这个大杂院处处春光，使得人们的精神面貌，尤其是人与人之间的关系，正在发生深刻的新变化。
    从旧思想里解放出来
    解放后，这个大院居民的思想觉悟不断提高。但是几千年遗留下来的旧思想还在毒害着人们的灵魂。不少的家属想的是自己的孩子、爱人、小家庭；议论的是张家长，李家短；吵架斗嘴的事情，时有发生。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮中，大院里的家属们在自己的灵魂深处闹起了革命。
    不久前，在一个晴朗的上午，他们又一次学习了《为人民服务》。一位退休老工人带着老花镜给大家读：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。张思德同志就是我们这个队伍中的一个同志。”……伟大领袖毛主席的教导激荡着每个人的心，人们都聚精会神地听着，思索着，三三五五地低声议论着。
    五十多岁的王大妈，每次学习《为人民服务》，都抑制不住内心的激动。解放前，她在北京珠市口街头为人缝缝补补，熬过了漫长的艰苦岁月。她说：“毛主席把俺从旧社会的苦水里救出来，现在毛主席又帮助俺从旧思想里解放出来。旧社会为私，新社会为公。听毛主席的话，俺明白了人活着不能只顾自己，要像张思德那样为人民服务，才最有意思。”她身体不好，手脚不灵便，但是看到年轻妇女要到外面参加文化大革命活动，就主动去帮助她们看看家，照管照管孩子。她兴奋地说：“一个人，只要有了为人民服务的思想，到处都能找到为人民服务的机会。”
    活学活用毛主席著作，使大院里许多人胸襟大大地开阔了，关心国家大事，关心公共事务的人越来越多。现在，许多老人和妇女们聚集在一起，话题中心已经再不是议论东家长，西家短，而是谈论着文化大革命，谈论着红卫兵小将们的革命精神和国内外大事。过去，有些人不愿意搞公共卫生，现在都争着去打扫公共场所。
    为人民服务的思想不能“退休”
    伟大的毛泽东思想，把大院居民的思想提高到一个崭新的境界，出现了一批热心为公的“老积极”，“好家属”。
    每到月末，大院里就可以看到一位白发苍苍的老大爷，提着小口袋，来到各家各户，收集水、电费。这位“义务收款员”就是退休老工人常伯慈。他在房间里挂起了毛主席像和毛主席语录。他说：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳，抬头看见毛主席，心里就亮堂。”他学了《为人民服务》以后，主动把大院的水、电管理起来，每月挨家挨户收费，再汇总交到有关部门，节省了大家很多时间。这位老人每逢星期二、五，就去为大院的居民读毛主席著作；每逢星期一、四，就组织街道的积极分子在一起学习毛主席著作。日常生活中处处“急人之急”。装卸工人高玉夫妇都有工作，四个孩子很小，每天做饭有困难。常伯慈老人想：“邻居的困难，也就是自己的困难，一定要帮助解决！”于是，他经常去帮助高玉家生火、烧水。高玉夫妇下了班，火旺了，水热了，马上可以动手做饭。这对夫妇感激地说：“家里有常大爷帮助，我们干起工作来，心里很踏实。旧社会是‘自扫门前雪’，只有在伟大的毛泽东时代，才能出现这样的好人好事。”大院居民们对这位老人深为尊敬。有人劝告他说：“你退休了，该歇歇了，干嘛还忙得这个样？”他说：“我虽说退休了，但是为人民服务的思想不能退休。天天读毛主席的书，事事听毛主席的话，一个人就永远不会觉得老。”
    招待好毛主席请来的客人
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，敢想、敢干、敢革命的红卫兵们，给这里的家属们留下了深刻的印象。
    前些日子，居民委员会分配这个大院接待一部分外地来京串连的红卫兵和革命师生。大院的家属们把招待毛主席请来的客人，当做是自己的莫大荣誉。他们立即动员起来，凑起了锅碗瓢勺，拿出了自己最干净的被子，许多妇女夜以继日地轮流去做饭、烧水。
    在为外地红卫兵和革命师生做饭的伙房里，热气腾腾，一片繁忙景象。子女多的妇女把孩子托给别人也跑来了。白天家务事多的，便跑来上夜班。她们满腔热情，一直为革命小将们辛勤地服务了几个月。
    她们把一碗碗的热饭、热菜送到红卫兵和革命师生的手里。她们也接过一封封革命小将们热情洋溢的感谢信。
    在这些为红卫兵和革命师生操劳的妇女中，人们特别称赞工人家属杨秀莲。她是六个孩子的母亲，家务事很多。她白天为红卫兵做饭，晚上回来为孩子们洗洗补补，一直忙到深夜。她说：“红卫兵是毛主席请来的客人，我们住在毛主席身边的人，一定要好好接待他们，让他们吃好、睡好。”
    “要招待好毛主席的客人！”这是整个居民大院家属们的共同语言，也表达了她们关心国家大事，关心文化大革命的共同思想。
    一个阶级友爱的大家庭
    这个大院的居民们一遍又一遍地学习“老三篇”，伟大的毛泽东思想把居民们的思想逐步地统一起来，使大院成了一个阶级友爱的大家庭。
    五十三岁的大娘孙桂兰，过去是一个“事不关己，高高挂起”的人。她学习了毛主席著作以后，高兴地说：“从前俺认为只管自己、莫管别人是对的，现在俺才知道这是自由主义和个人主义。毛主席说，革命的人民要大团结，全世界人民要大团结。我们住在一个大院里的阶级弟兄更要讲团结。”她看到有的“双职工”回家做饭要用炉子，就事先帮他们生好火。她身体不大好，可是经常清早就起来扫走廊，扫过道，把院子打扫得干干净净。她说：“不学毛主席著作脑子笨，毛病多，学了毛主席著作，为集体做点好事，心里感到比吃什么灵丹妙药都痛快。”
    阶级友爱还表现在政治上、思想上的互相关心，互相帮助。
    在大院的一角，杨秀莲和王淑珍在亲切地交谈着。她俩是在一块学习毛主席的一条语录。
    “什么叫全心全意为人民服务？白求恩同志，不远万里来到中国，为了帮助中国人民求解放而献出了自己的生命，真是毫不利己专门利人。这才是全心全意……”杨秀莲热情地讲着自己的学习体会。
    “咱们在这个大院怎样全心全意为人民服务？有工作要跑到别人的前面，像白求恩同志那样极端的负责任……。”王淑珍若有所悟地补充说。
    杨秀莲自己不识字，可是她对毛主席著作有深厚的阶级感情，她要孩子们当老师，以顽强的毅力熟记了许多毛主席语录，细心琢磨毛主席说的每一句话的意思。她看到家属王淑珍学习毛主席语录有困难，就主动来帮助。毛泽东思想把这两位家庭妇女连结在一起，团结在一起。
    这个大院的居民们以无比兴奋的心情说：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳。心中升起了红太阳，大院的一切变了样。”的确，伟大的毛泽东思想在这个大院里放射出了灿烂夺目的光辉。本报记者
