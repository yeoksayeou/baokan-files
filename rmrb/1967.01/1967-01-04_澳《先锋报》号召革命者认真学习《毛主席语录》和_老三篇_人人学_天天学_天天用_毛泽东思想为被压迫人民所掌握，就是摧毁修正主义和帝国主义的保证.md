	The Australian "Vanguard" Newspaper Calls on Revolutionaries to Seriously Study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles"
	Everyone Should Study, Every Day, and Use Them Every Day
	Mao Zedong Thought in the Hands of the Oppressed People is the Guarantee to Destroy Revisionism and Imperialism

	BEIJING, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- A recent issue of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ "Vanguard" calls on Australian revolutionaries to seriously study Mao Zedong Thought, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and the "Three Articles." It says, "Everyone should study, every day, and use them every day," and strive to popularize Mao Zedong Thought among the masses. The article enthusiastically states: "For revolutionaries, for all the oppressed, Mao Zedong Thought is the most precious treasure."

	The article denounces the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for colluding with the most vicious enemy of the world's people, U.S. imperialism, to jointly oppose China. The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and U.S. imperialists hate and slander China because they share a common fear, "which is the fear of socialist revolution. They fear Mao Zedong Thought—the highest development of Marxism-Leninism—which attracts the world's oppressed people."

	The article emphasizes that Mao Zedong Thought makes the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists very afraid. "This thought advances and develops the immortal thoughts of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin." The article points out that Mao Zedong Thought in the hands of the world's oppressed people is the guarantee to ultimately destroy revisionism and imperialism.

	The article praises the Chinese revolutionaries for spreading Mao Zedong Thought around the world as "fulfilling the international duty of the proletariat." The article points out that the large-scale promotion of Mao Zedong Thought in China and around the world has caused panic among imperialists and revisionists. The article concludes by calling, "Let us do our utmost to make Mao Zedong Thought the property of the masses, making the revisionists and imperialists even more terrified!"

    澳《先锋报》号召革命者认真学习《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”
    人人学　天天学　天天用
    毛泽东思想为被压迫人民所掌握，就是摧毁修正主义和帝国主义的保证
    新华社一日讯　墨尔本消息：最近出版的一期澳大利亚共产党（马列主义者）机关报《先锋报》在一篇文章中号召澳大利亚的革命者都来认真学习毛泽东思想，认真学习《毛主席语录》和“老三篇”，“应该人人学，天天学，天天用”，并且尽力在群众中普及毛泽东思想。文章热情洋溢地写道：“对革命者，对一切被压迫者来说，毛泽东思想是最珍贵的财宝。”
    文章谴责苏联修正主义领导集团同世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义加紧勾结，联合反华。文章指出，苏联修正主义领导集团和美帝国主义者仇恨和辱骂中国，是因为它们有着共同的恐惧，“这就是害怕社会主义革命。害怕毛泽东思想——马克思列宁主义的最高发展——对世界被压迫人民的吸引力。”
    文章强调说，毛泽东思想使苏联修正主义和美帝国主义十分害怕。“这种思想推进和发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的不朽思想。”文章指出，毛泽东思想为世界被压迫人民所掌握，就是最终摧毁修正主义和帝国主义的保证。
    文章赞扬中国革命者向全世界传播毛泽东思想是在“履行无产阶级的国际义务”。文章指出，在全中国和全世界大规模宣传毛泽东思想，引起了帝国主义者和修正主义者的恐慌。文章最后号召说：“让我们尽自己的力量使毛泽东思想为群众所掌握，使修正主义者和帝国主义者更加胆战心惊！”
