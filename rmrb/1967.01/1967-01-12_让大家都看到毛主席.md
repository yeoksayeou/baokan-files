In the industrial city of Lahore in West Pakistan, a social worker named Muhammad was deeply moved by the fact that the Chinese people resolutely support the Pakistani people's struggle against Indian aggression and the Kashmiri people's struggle for self-determination. He came to realize that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, are truly opposed to imperialism and colonialism, uphold justice, and support the struggles for independence and liberation.

One day, he saw a color photograph of Chairman Mao in a Chinese magazine. He was overjoyed and immediately cut it out, framed it, and hung it on the wall of his room.

Muhammad's friends saw the photograph of Chairman Mao in his home. They said, "The Chinese people are the closest and most sincere friends of the Pakistani people. Everyone should be able to see Chairman Mao often." So, he hung the portrait of Chairman Mao in places where he and his friends frequently gathered. Then, they went to Lahore to buy more Chinese magazines, cut out the photographs of Chairman Mao, and hung them on the walls or placed them under the glass on the tables.

    让大家都看到毛主席
    在西巴基斯坦的工业城市莱雅普尔，一位名叫穆罕默德的社会工作者，从中国人民坚决支持巴基斯坦人民反对印度侵略的斗争和克什米尔人民争取自决权的斗争的事实中深深地认识到，中国人民在毛主席的领导下，是真正反对帝国主义，反对殖民主义，伸张正义和支持争取独立与解放的斗争的。
    有一天，他看到中国画报上有一张毛主席彩色照片，非常高兴，立即把它剪下来，装进镜框里，挂在房间的墙上。
    穆罕默德的朋友在他家里看到了这一张毛主席照片，他们说，中国人民是巴基斯坦人民的最亲密、最诚挚的朋友，应该让大家都能常常看到毛主席。他就把毛主席像挂在他和他的朋友经常聚集的地方。接着，他们又到拉合尔去买中国画报，把毛主席照片剪下来挂在墙上或放在桌子上的玻璃板下。
