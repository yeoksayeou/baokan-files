	Chairman Mao's Quotations
	The principles of Marxism are numerous and complex, but ultimately, they boil down to one sentence: "Rebellion is justified." ... Based on this principle, we rebel, we struggle, and we build socialism.
	_From the Speech at the Celebration of Stalin's 60th Birthday by the Various Circles in Yan'an_
