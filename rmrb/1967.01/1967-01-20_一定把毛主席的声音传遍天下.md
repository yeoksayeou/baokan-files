The revolutionary rebels in Shanghai's news industry will not let down the great leader and the revolutionary masses. They will rely closely on all revolutionary rebels in the city and timely reflect the struggles on the frontlines of the Cultural Revolution.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on the 19th stated: The People's Daily's editorial "Let Mao Zedong Thought Occupy the Newspaper Battlefield," and Xinhua's report titled "Chairman Mao Highly Praises This as a Great Revolution" about the rebirth of the Shanghai Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily, have stirred strong reactions among the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai's various news organizations. Many revolutionary rebel fighters, after reading the editorial and the report, could not help but raise their fists and shout, "Long live the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" They said, "The fact that the leadership of the newspapers has been seized from the hands of the bourgeois rightists is a great victory for the brilliant and boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's high evaluation of our newspapers' rebirth is not only a great support for all revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and the entire country's news industry, but also a great support for all revolutionary rebels nationwide."

Representatives of the revolutionary rebels from various news organizations in Shanghai held a meeting at the Wenhui Daily office today, enthusiastically discussing the great encouragement and inspiration they received from the editorial and the report.

Everyone at the meeting spoke from personal experience: "The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power." This is an absolute truth. Newspapers are important tools of class struggle. If newspapers are in the hands of those who take the capitalist road and stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, they will inevitably become tools of the bourgeois dictatorship over the proletariat. Comrades from the revolutionary rebel factions of the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily introduced the situation before and after the seizure of power. They said that before the proletarian revolutionary rebels took over the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily, they were tools for propagating capitalism and revisionism, implementing the bourgeois reactionary line, and suppressing the revolutionary rebels. The newspapers were dull and lifeless, and the great situation of the Shanghai proletarian cultural revolution and the struggles of the revolutionary rebels exposing and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of the Shanghai Municipal Committee could not be reflected in the newspapers. Articles written by reporters on these issues were all suppressed. The revolutionary rebels within the newspaper felt that if they did not seize the leadership, Chairman Mao's voice and the voice of the proletarian revolutionary rebels could not be spread. The longer the power seizure was delayed, the longer the harmful influence of the bourgeois reactionary line would last, and the proletarian cultural revolution would suffer more losses. "So many things are urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment." The revolutionary rebel comrades from the two newspapers, with the revolutionary spirit of "striving for every moment," united with the revolutionary rebels inside and outside the newspaper, decisively seized the leadership of the newspapers, and firmly grasped the fate of the people's mouthpiece in their own hands. After the revolutionary rebels took power, the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily underwent a complete transformation, firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, holding high the banner of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and filling every page of the newspaper with the voices of the revolutionary rebels, sharp, bold, and distinct, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

The revolutionary rebels from the Xinhua News Agency Shanghai branch and the Shanghai Evening News said that seizing the leadership of the newspapers from the bourgeois rightists is a great revolution, a revolution where one class overthrows another. This power struggle is bound to encounter setbacks, but the revolutionary rebels have never bowed their heads or retreated in the face of difficulties. The revolutionary rebel comrades from the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily remembered Chairman Mao's teaching, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," and were full of confidence in victory, ultimately achieving victory in the struggle.

Everyone mentioned that although the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily have seized power and been reborn, the tasks facing the revolutionary rebels and comrades are still arduous. A small handful of those in power within the party who take the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line are still watching the "good show" put on by the revolutionary rebels. They think that without them, the revolutionary rebels cannot run the newspapers well, which is a foolish fantasy. The revolutionary rebels and comrades, with the newly born Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily, which are red and full of Mao Zedong Thought, have shattered these old gentlemen's dreams. The revolutionary rebels will use more facts to make these old gentlemen's illusions completely collapse. Comrades from the revolutionary rebel faction of the Wenhui Daily said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "We not only are good at destroying an old world, but we also will be good at building a new world." We have the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and the great leader Chairman Mao, and the support of the revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses in the city and the country. We have the confidence to run the newspapers better and better.

Comrades from the Red Guards Shanghai Municipal Higher Education Revolutionary Committee and the Red Guards Shanghai Command, who run the Red Guards Battle News, excitedly said: Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction for us. With great aspirations and passion, in the new year of nationwide class struggle, we will run the newspapers as a battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. "Our newspapers should be run by everyone, by all the people, by the entire party, and cannot be run by a few people behind closed doors." This is the mass line of running newspapers pointed out by our great leader Mao Zedong as early as April 2, 1948, in his "Talk to the Editorial Staff of the Jin-Sui Daily." The newly born Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily are rich in content and sharp and bold precisely because they have implemented Chairman Mao's instruction and closely relied on the revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses from all walks of life in the city.

Comrades from the revolutionary rebel faction of the Wenhui Daily said, we revolutionary rebels are a minority in the newspaper office. After we took over, we were able to run the newspaper decently, not because we have great abilities, but because of the power of the great unity of the revolutionary rebels in the city. We listen to Chairman Mao's words and strive to unite with all the revolutionary rebels in the city and fight together. Only in this way can we timely discover some major themes in the proletarian cultural revolution and obtain specific support from the revolutionary rebels in the city. Like the "Letter to the People of Shanghai," it was written by comrades from the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and other revolutionary organizations on the frontlines of fighting against bourgeois economism. They wrote it well and timely, and we published it promptly, which played a role in promoting the actual struggle.

The comrades present mentioned that the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have given such high praise to the Shanghai revolutionary rebels for seizing the leadership of the newspapers, which is the greatest support, encouragement, and motivation for everyone. Comrades from the revolutionary rebel factions of the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily said: We must always remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind." Seizing the leadership from the bourgeois rightists is only the first step of a ten-thousand-mile journey. To run the newspapers as a powerful battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, we still need to work diligently and make long-term, arduous efforts. Comrades from the revolutionary rebel factions of the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station and the Shanghai Evening News also expressed that they would not let down the great leader Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses' sincere expectations. They would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, be humble and avoid arrogance, truly let Mao Zedong Thought occupy the newspaper and broadcasting battlefields, and convey the voice of the Party and Chairman Mao to the broad revolutionary masses.

    一定把毛主席的声音传遍天下
    上海新闻界革命造反派，决不辜负伟大领袖和革命群众的期望，紧紧依靠全市革命造反派，及时反映文化大革命火线上的斗争。
    新华社上海十九日电　《人民日报》就上海《文汇报》和《解放日报》的新生发表的社论《让毛泽东思想占领报纸阵地》，以及新华社以《毛主席高度称赞这是一个大革命》为题播发的有关《文汇报》《解放日报》新生的新闻，引起了上海各新闻单位革命造反派的强烈反响。许多革命造反派战士读了社论和报道，情不自禁地振臂高呼：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们说：报纸的领导权能够从资产阶级右派手里夺过来，这是光芒万丈、光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。毛主席对我们报纸的新生给了那么高的评价，这不仅是对全上海和全国新闻界革命造反派的极大支持，也是对全国所有革命造反派的极大支持。
    上海各新闻单位的革命造反派代表今天在《文汇报》社举行了座谈会，兴奋地畅谈社论和报道给自己的莫大鼓舞和激励。
    大家在座谈会上以切身体会谈到：“革命的根本问题是政权问题”，这是千真万确的真理。报纸是阶级斗争的重要工具。报纸掌握在走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人手里，就必然成为资产阶级对无产阶级专政的工具。《文汇报》、《解放
  日报》的革命造反派同志在会上介绍了夺权前后的情况。他们说，无产阶级革命造反派接管以前的《文汇报》和《解放日报》，就是宣传资本主义、修正主义，贯彻资产阶级反动路线，镇压革命造反派的工具。报纸办得死气沉沉，上海无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，革命造反派揭发、批判上海市委资产阶级反动路线的斗争情况，不能通过报纸反映出来。记者采写了这方面的稿件，都被扼杀了。报社内的革命造反派深感不把领导权夺过来，毛主席的声音，无产阶级革命造反派的声音，就无法传播出去。迟一天夺权，资产阶级反动路线的恶劣影响就延长一天，无产阶级文化大革命就多受一天损失。“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”两个报社的革命造反派同志，就是以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，联合报社内外的革命造反派，果断地把报纸的领导权夺了过来，把人民喉舌的命运紧紧掌握在自己手里。革命造反派掌权以后的《文汇报》和《解放日报》面貌一新，坚决站在无产阶级革命造反派一边，高举以毛主席为代表的革命路线的大旗，整张报纸充满了革命造反派的声音，尖锐、泼辣、鲜明，大长无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭资产阶级的威风。
    新华社上海分社、《上海晚报》的革命造反派说，从资产阶级右派手里夺回报纸的领导权，是一个大革命，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的大革命。这一场夺权斗争不可能不遇到挫折，但是革命造反派从来不向困难低头却步。《文汇报》、《解放日报》的革命造反派同志牢记毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，对胜利充满着信心，最后终于取得了斗争的胜利。
    大家谈到，《文汇报》、《解放日报》的革命造反派夺了权，报纸新生了。但是摆在革命造反派和革命同志面前的任务还是艰巨的。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，还在那里看革命造反派的“好戏”，他们以为少了他们这伙人，革命造反派就办不好报纸，这是痴心妄想。革命造反派和革命同志以高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的、红彤彤的、新生的《文汇报》、《解放日报》这个活生生的事实，粉碎了这些老爷们的美梦。革命造反派将以更多的事实，使这些老爷们的幻想彻底覆灭。《文汇报》的革命造反派同志说：毛主席教导我们：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想这一威力无比的武器，有党中央和伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有全市和全国的革命造反派和广大革命群众的支持，我们有信心，一定把报纸办得越来越好。
    红卫兵上海市大专院校革命委员会、红卫兵上海司令部主办的《红卫战报》的同志激动地说：毛主席给我们指出了方向，我们满怀壮志豪情，在全国全面展开阶级斗争的新的一年里，把报纸办成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。“我们的报纸也要靠大家来办，靠全体人民群众来办，靠全党来办，而不能只靠少数人关起门来办。”这是我们伟大领袖毛主席早在一九四八年四月二日《对晋绥日报编辑人员的谈话》中就指出的群众路线的办报方针。新生的《文汇报》和《解放日报》之所以内容丰富，尖锐泼辣，正是由于贯彻了毛主席的这一指示，紧紧依靠全市各界的革命造反派和广大革命群众的结果。
    《文汇报》革命造反派的同志说，我们革命造反派在报社里是少数，我们接管以后，能把报纸办得像样一些，不是我们本身有多大本领，而是全市革命造反派大联合的威力。我们听毛主席的话，尽量和全市革命造反派团结在一起，战斗在一起。这样，我们才能及时发现无产阶级文化大革命中的一些重大主题，才能得到全市革命造反派的具体支持。像《告上海全市人民书》，就是上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命组织的同志在反击资产阶级经济主义的火线上写的，他们写得好，写得及时，我们及时发表了，就对实际斗争起了推动作用。
    到会同志谈到，伟大领袖毛主席和党中央对上海革命造反派夺回报纸领导权给予这样高度的赞扬，是对大家的最大支持，最大鼓舞，更是最大的鞭策。《文汇报》、《解放日报》革命造反派的同志说：我们要永远记住毛主席的教导：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”我们从资产阶级右派手里把领导权夺过来，不过是万里长征的第一步。要把报纸办成宣传毛泽东思想的强有力的阵地，还需要我们兢兢业业，付出长期的艰苦的努力。上海人民广播电台、《上海晚报》等单位的革命造反派同志，也表示要决不辜负伟大领袖毛主席和广大革命群众的殷切期望，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，戒骄戒躁，真正做到让毛泽东思想占领报纸、广播阵地，向广大革命群众传达党和毛主席的声音。
