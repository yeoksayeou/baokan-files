Financial and Commercial System Revolutionary Rebels Oppose Economism, Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line
Emergency Telegram

At present, the great proletarian cultural revolution is sweeping forward with an irresistible momentum in industrial and mining enterprises and rural areas. Broad masses of revolutionary workers and peasants are rising up, together with revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, to resolutely fight against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. The situation is excellent and getting better and better!

Under the impact of this irresistible revolutionary torrent, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are making new counterattacks in various ways. As Chairman Mao has said, "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord." They are playing all sorts of tricks, shooting poisoned arrows, and doing everything they can to sabotage the great proletarian cultural revolution.

After their trick of "emphasizing production to suppress the revolution" failed, they now appear in an "ultra-left" guise to carry out new conspiracies. They collude with bourgeois elements in society, landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to incite the masses of workers to leave their production and work posts, thereby sabotaging production, transportation, and the entire national economy. At the same time, they use psychological warfare, advocating material incentives, and stirring up a small number of workers who do not understand the truth to create trouble with economism.

Comrades in the revolution, this is a new form of frenzied counterattack by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line against the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! Their evil intentions, as stated in the _Urgent Notice_ issued by the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels, are: to sabotage production, endanger the national economy and people's livelihood to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose the Party Central Committee, and put pressure on the Central Cultural Revolution Group to achieve the goal of sabotaging the cultural revolution; to use economism to divert the main direction of the struggle, attempting to lead a serious political struggle astray into economic struggle; and to use material interests to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, promoting peaceful evolution, and attempting to achieve a full restoration of capitalism. Comrades in the revolution, in the face of this extremely reactionary economism, we must respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, learn from the comrades of the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels, and resolutely oppose economism! Resolutely and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

The financial and commercial system is a very important front in the proletarian cultural revolution. The class enemy wants to promote economism and material incentives, and they will do so through this channel. Therefore, to thoroughly smash reactionary economism, the revolutionary rebels on the financial and commercial front bear a particularly heavy responsibility. To quickly reverse this situation, the Financial and Commercial System Revolutionary Rebels Oppose Economism, Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line Pledge Rally issues the following urgent appeals:

1. Revolutionary rebels must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's brilliant policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and become pioneers in grasping the revolution and models in promoting production.

2. Resolutely implement the five provisions of the _Notice on Opposing Economism_ issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 11, 1967.

   Resolutely implement the ten appeals of the _Urgent Notice_ issued by the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 32 other revolutionary organizations.

3. All revolutionary financial and accounting personnel must, on their posts, unshakably act according to the Party's financial policies, resolutely fight against bad and reactionary behaviors, and not shift the contradictions upward.

4. Regarding national taxes, the broad masses of revolutionaries across the country must resolutely protect them and collect them according to state regulations. Taxes already collected that comply with state regulations shall not be refunded; changes to tax laws shall be handled in the later stages of the movement. Illegally refunded taxes shall be recovered in full.

5. All decisions made during the movement to arbitrarily raise wages, increase wage subsidies, increase welfare, issue bonuses indiscriminately, issue travel allowances for cadres, staff, and students indiscriminately, and issue other various allowances shall be null and void from now on. Those already issued shall be recovered by the responsible signatories (can be repaid in installments). Funds borrowed by revolutionary student reception stations shall be recovered in full.

6. Materials and funds seized by the Red Guards during the destruction of the Four Olds shall be turned over to the state. Those already privately divided shall be returned and turned over to the state as state financial revenue.

7. Revolutionary rebels in the banking sector, especially frontline revolutionary accountants, cashiers, and credit personnel, must strictly supervise the expenditures of various units such as government agencies, organizations, factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools, and supervise the recovery of various funds issued or illegally issued by the aforementioned power-holders.

8. All revolutionary rebels across the country have the duty to resolutely assist the People's Liberation Army and public security departments to protect the safety of state banks. Henceforth, if there are still bad elements inciting the masses to surround banks and forcibly withdraw funds, they shall be dealt with as counter-revolutionaries.

9. To maintain and enhance our country's international prestige, revolutionary rebels in the foreign trade sector must take immediate action, cooperate with revolutionary masses of relevant departments, take emergency measures to solve the current port congestion problem, ensure the timely unloading of imported goods, ensure the timely export of goods, and strictly fulfill foreign-contracted agreements. From now on, if there are any incitements to stop production by port workers, they shall be dealt with as counter-revolutionaries.

   Revolutionary rebels in the foreign trade sector must immediately clear up and respond to all unanswered foreign letters and telegrams, promptly handle the signing of export commodities and the ordering of imported goods, and strive to complete and overfulfill the 1967 national foreign trade plan.

10. Revolutionary rebels in the commercial sector must strive to do a good job in commodity transportation to ensure the supply of daily necessities for the people. At the same time, they must protect state commodities, strictly prohibit the private division of state commodities. Those who have already privately divided state commodities must return them. From now on, if there are still people inciting employees to privately divide state commodities, they shall be dealt with as counter-revolutionaries.

   In addition, rely on the broad masses of revolutionaries to strengthen market management, resolutely crack down on speculation, and severely punish speculators to consolidate the socialist economic front.

11. The above provisions are to be immediately implemented by all revolutionary rebel organizations and the broad masses of revolutionaries across the country, and all propaganda machinery is to be mobilized for propaganda and education.

12. The above provisions are to be implemented by all levels of organizations and public security departments. Anyone who violates the above provisions shall be investigated and dealt with for sabotaging state finance and credit, sabotaging the dictatorship of the proletariat, and sabotaging the proletarian cultural revolution.

Comrades in the revolution across the country, let us unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely oppose economism, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, launch a nationwide comprehensive class struggle, and struggle to take control of the destiny of the proletarian cultural revolution, take control of the destiny of struggle-criticism-transformation, take control of the destiny of production and work, and take control of the destiny of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist state!

Down with economism!

Thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

Long live the great dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

    新华社二十一日讯　财贸系统革命造反派反对经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑誓师大会
    紧急通电
    现在，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，正以排山倒海之势，在工矿企业和农村全面深入地展开。广大革命工农群众纷纷起来，同广大革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部一起，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，与党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人进行坚决的斗争。形势好得很，而且愈来愈好！
    在这种不可抵挡的革命洪流的冲击下，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，正以各种方式进行新的反扑。正如毛主席所说的那样：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”他们耍尽种种阴谋，放出一支支暗箭，竭力破坏伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。
    他们玩弄的“抓生产”压革命的诡计破产后，就以极“左”的面目出现，进行新的阴谋活动。他们勾结社会上的资产阶级分子，地、富、反、坏、右分子，煽动职工群众，离开生产和工作岗位，以破坏生产，破坏交通，破坏整个国民经济。与此同时，他们还采取攻心战术，大搞物质刺激，挑动不明真相的少数工人大闹经济主义。
    革命的同志们，这是一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人向以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线进行猖狂反扑的新形式！其罪恶目的，正如上海革命造反派在《紧急通告》里所说的那样：以破坏生产，危害国计民生来对抗毛主席，对抗党中央，对中央文革小组施加压力，以达到破坏文化大革命的目的；以经济主义的手段转移斗争的大方向，企图把一场严肃的政治斗争引入经济斗争的邪路上去；同时以物质利益来腐蚀群众的革命意志，推行和平演变，妄图实现资本主义的全面复辟。革命的同志们，面对这种反动透顶的经济主义，我们一定要响应党中央和毛主席的伟大号召，向上海革命造反派的同志们学习，坚决反对经济主义！坚决彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    财贸系统是无产阶级文化大革命中的一条极为重要的战线。阶级敌人要搞经济主义、物质刺激，都要通过这条渠道。所以，彻底粉碎反动的经济主义，我们财贸战线上的革命造反派就担负着特别重的担子。为了迅速扭转这种局面，现在，财贸系统革命造反派反对经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑誓师大会，发出下列紧急呼吁：
    一，革命造反派，必须坚决高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的英明方针，成为抓革命的先锋，促生产的模范。
    二，坚决贯彻执行中共中央一九六七年一月十一日发布的《中共中央关于反对经济主义的通知》的五条规定。
    坚决贯彻执行上海工人革命造反总司令部等三十二个革命组织的《紧急通告》的十条呼吁。
    三，一切革命的财会出纳工作人员，在岗位上一定要坚定不移地按照党的财经政策办事，坚决与不良的、反动的行为作斗争，丝毫不动摇。同时坚决不把矛盾上交。
    四，对国家税收，全国广大的革命群众，一定要坚决加以保护，按国家规定进行征收。过去已征收的税款，凡是符合国家规定的，一律不退；涉及税法规定的更改，要放到运动后期处理。凡是不合法的已退税款，一律重新收回。
    五，凡在运动中不按规定擅自作出的提高工资，增加工资补贴，增加福利，滥发奖金，滥发干部、职工和学生的串连补助费，滥发其他各种补助等决定，自即日起一律作废。已经发给的，一律由当权派签发者负责追回（可分期退回）。各地革命师生接待站借出的资金，一律要收回。
    六，红卫兵扫四旧没收的物资、资金一律归公。凡已经私分掉的，应一律退出上缴归公，作为国家财政收入。
    七，银行部门的革命造反派，特别是第一线上的革命的会计、出纳、信贷员，更要严格监督各机关、团体、厂矿企业、事业、学校等单位的开支，监督上述当权派签发或者不合法滥发的上述各种资金的追回。
    八，全国一切革命造反派都有义务坚决协助人民解放军和公安部门，负责保护国家银行的安全。今后如仍有坏分子煽动群众，包围银行强行提款的，以现行反革命惩处。
    九，为了维护和提高我国的国际威望，外贸部门的革命造反派要立即行动起来，配合有关部门的革命群众，采取紧急措施，解决目前的港口堵塞问题，以保证国家进口货物及时卸货，保证国家出口货物及时装运出口，严格履行对外签订的合同。即日起，发现有煽动港口工人停止生产的，以现行反革命惩处。
    外贸部门的革命造反派要立即将积压未复的外国来函来电加以清理，及时予以答复，抓紧出口商品的成交和进口货物的订购，为完成和超额完成一九六七年国家的外贸计划而努力。
    十，商业部门的革命造反派要努力做好商品调运工作，以保证人民生活必需品的供应。同时，要努力保护好国家商品，严禁私分国家商品。已经私分国家商品的，一律要退还。自即日起，如仍有人煽动职工私分国家商品，以现行反革命惩处。
    另外，还要依靠广大革命群众加强市场管理，坚决打击投机倒把，对投机倒把分子要严厉惩处，以巩固社会主义经济阵地。
    十一，上述各条，希各单位造反派组织和全国广大革命群众立即贯彻执行，开动一切宣传机器，进行宣传教育。
    十二，上述各条，责令各级组织和公安部门照此执行，凡有违犯上述各条者，立即以破坏国家财政金融，破坏无产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级文化大革命查处。
    全国的革命造反派，让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想红旗下，联合起来，坚决反对经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，展开全国全面的阶级斗争，为自己掌握无产阶级文化大革命的命运，自己掌握斗批改的命运，自己掌握生产和工作的命运，自己掌握无产阶级专政和社会主义国家的命运而奋斗！
    打倒经济主义！
    彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    伟大的无产阶级专政万岁！
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    财贸系统革命造反派反对经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑誓师大会
                  一九六七年一月十八日
