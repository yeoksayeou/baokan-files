The proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai have united to seize control of the newspapers, firmly grasping the destiny of the people's voice. Chairman Mao has highly praised this as a great revolution.

The newly born *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily*, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism, have launched a fierce counterattack against the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line. Their stance is clear, their criticism is sharp, and they are filled with a fighting spirit. Revolutionary masses say: "Rebel newspapers are great!"

New China News Agency, Shanghai, January 18th — With the development of revolutionary forces in Shanghai, the brand-new, revolutionary *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* have emerged.

*Wenhui Bao* rebelled on January 4th, and *Liberation Daily* rebelled on January 6th. After breaking free from the control of the criminal bourgeois reactionary line, the newly born *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* have swept away the previous atmosphere of "all horses silent," holding high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the banner of revolutionary criticism, launching a fierce counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line. The country's another big-character poster, *A Letter to the People of Shanghai*, was published in the January 5th issue of *Wenhui Bao*.

The emergence of the newly born *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* is a great revolution, a revolution where one class overthrows another. This is the product of the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai. This is a major event in the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and a great innovation in the history of our country's journalism. The rebellion of these two newspapers reflects that the strength of the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai has begun to dominate, marking the entry of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide into a new stage. This major event will undoubtedly have a great promoting effect on the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire East China and in all provinces and cities nationwide.

The rebellion of the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* is not accidental. This is the inevitable result of the great struggle and great battle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line in the Shanghai region, and the product of the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line over the bourgeois reactionary line.

These two newspapers should have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and become tools of proletarian dictatorship. However, due to the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, these two newspapers have repeatedly taken the path of counter-revolutionary revisionism, committing heinous crimes against the Party and the people. *Wenhui Bao* became a tool for the bourgeois rightists to launch a frenzied attack on the Party in 1957, and in 1961 and 1962, it became a tool for the restoration of capitalism. The *Liberation Daily*, which is nominally the organ of the Municipal Party Committee, has been under the control of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Municipal Party Committee and the newspaper in recent years. It has resisted the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought, attacked the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and advocated revisionism, becoming a chorus of ghosts and monsters both inside and outside the Party.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The revolutionary leftists of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily*, united with the revolutionary forces outside the newspaper, have launched a fierce struggle against the reactionary line of these two newspapers. Great leader Chairman Mao has been deeply concerned about their struggle. Chairman Mao has always supported the revolutionary leftists and has repeatedly turned around the major direction of *Wenhui Bao*. Under Chairman Mao's personal leadership, from November 1965 to May 1966, a criticism of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* and *San Jie Village* was carried out in *Wenhui Bao*, marking the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. *Wenhui Bao* raised the banner of revolutionary criticism. However, after the big-character poster written by Nie Yuanzi and others on June 1, 1966, was broadcast, *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* not only did not actively participate in this unprecedented cultural revolution but stubbornly carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, confusing right and wrong, suppressing the revolutionary factions, and stifling dissenting opinions. They flaunted the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and crushed the spirit of the proletariat, attempting to suppress the vigorous mass movement. They have completely degenerated into tools of bourgeois dictatorship over the proletariat, becoming reactionary newspapers that implement the bourgeois reactionary line.

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. Facts have educated the revolutionary leftists that to make the newspaper a tool of proletarian dictatorship, the leadership of the newspaper must be seized by the revolutionary leftists. The newspaper must be run by the revolutionary leftists. The revolutionary masses of *Wenhui Bao*, since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, have overthrown the editorial board that had been implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line for many years. However, due to lack of experience, the revolutionary leftists did not directly seize the leadership of the newspaper but handed it over to the stubborn elements sent by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who insisted on carrying out the bourgeois reactionary line. These elements continued to change the direction of the newspaper, siding with the bourgeoisie, and carried out new conspiracies, using new methods to launch a new counterattack, fiercely suppressing the revolutionary rebels inside and outside the newspaper. They labeled the revolutionary leftists inside the newspaper as "dangerous elements" and "two-faced people." They intentionally published conservative articles in the newspaper. The stubborn elements of *Liberation Daily* who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line regarded the revolutionary Red Guards as a scourge. When the young revolutionaries of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee of Colleges and Universities rose up to criticize *Liberation Daily*, the old gentlemen of *Liberation Daily* and *Wenhui Bao*, under the planning of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, viciously attacked the Revolutionary Red Guards, inciting people to fight against people, and created the infamous "Liberation Daily Bloodshed Incident." At the same time, they brutally suppressed the revolutionary rebels inside the newspaper.

Enough is enough! The more oppressed, the more resistant. The rebels of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* did not surrender. With the support of the Third Headquarters in the capital and the young revolutionaries of the Shanghai Revolutionary Red Guards, they continued to fight. At the most difficult moment of the struggle, the eight comrades of the "Spark Igniting the Prairie Fire" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of *Wenhui Bao* solemnly swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, we will strive for victory." They said, "We are in the minority now, but the truth is on our side, and Chairman Mao supports us." Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao gave them boundless strength. With the belief of certain victory, they launched a more arduous struggle. The revolutionary rebel workers of the two newspapers showed great strength in the struggle. They were fearless of encirclement and isolation, fought bravely, and fought to the end, greatly educating and inspiring the revolutionary leftists in the editorial department.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary things, if you do not beat them, they will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor; if the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." The revolutionary rebels of *Wenhui Bao*, following Chairman Mao's teachings, inspired by the editorial of *Red Flag* magazine's 1966 Issue 15, *Win New Victories*, and riding the momentum of the great revolutionary situation in the Shanghai region, closely united with the revolutionary workers of the newspaper, launched a general attack on the stubborn stronghold of the bourgeois reactionary line in the newspaper. They exposed a large number of facts, mobilized the masses, won over the majority, and completely isolated a few stubborn elements who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line. Finally, on the evening of January 3rd, they seized the leadership of the newspaper. The vast majority of the newspaper's staff fully supported the great initiative of the "Spark Igniting the Prairie Fire" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters. On January 4th, a new *Wenhui Bao* was born!

The rebirth of *Wenhui Bao* greatly inspired the revolutionary rebels of *Liberation Daily*. They excitedly said: If we do not rebel, who will? This power, if not seized now, when will it be seized! The rebirth of *Wenhui Bao* was a fatal blow to a handful of stubborn elements of *Liberation Daily*. The comrades of the Revolutionary Rebel Command Headquarters of this newspaper, seizing this favorable situation, held a meeting on the evening of January 5th and announced the decision to take over *Liberation Daily*.

The rebirth of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* sounded the death knell for the bourgeois reactionary line implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee.

The *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* born from the flames of the Cultural Revolution, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "We must uphold the truth, and the truth must be clear," held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stood on the side of the revolutionary rebels, and launched a powerful offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee with fierce artillery fire, guiding the current propaganda and reporting work with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The first issue of *Wenhui Bao* after the takeover prominently published Chairman Mao's article for the July 1, 1957 issue of *People's Daily*, *The Bourgeois Direction of Wenhui Bao Must Be Criticized*.

Another big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in our country, *A Letter to the People of Shanghai*, written by eleven revolutionary rebel organizations including the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, appeared in *Wenhui Bao*. This is a very important document. This document, holding high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, sounded the bugle for continuing the fierce counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line. This document firmly responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," raising the key issues in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On January 9th, *People's Daily* published an extremely important editorial note according to Chairman Mao's instructions. This editorial note highly praised the rebellion of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily*, pointing out: "With the development of revolutionary forces in Shanghai, the brand-new, revolutionary *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* have emerged. This is the product of the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line over the bourgeois reactionary line. This is a major event in the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. This is a great revolution. This major event will undoubtedly have a great promoting effect on the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire East China and in all provinces and cities nationwide."

The newly born *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* have actively participated in the current nationwide comprehensive class struggle. Facing the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic trend of stopping production and suppressing the revolution played by a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, these two revolutionary newspapers have continuously published important articles such as *Urgent Announcement* and *Reporter's Commentary*, standing at the forefront of the struggle against counter-revolutionary revisionism. On January 8th, *Wenhui Bao* pointed out in an editorial note: "We must be vigilant. A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Shanghai region and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, they collude with capitalist forces in society, using various forms to lure some workers away from their production posts, attempting to use the evil means of sabotaging production to exert pressure on the Central Cultural Revolution Group, achieving their evil purposes of opposing the Party Central Committee, opposing Chairman Mao, and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution." Immediately, the January 10th issues of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* published editorials such as *Down with Economism* and *Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line*, continuing to give a blow to those who attempt to corrupt the masses with economism. The ten opinions of the *Urgent Announcement* published in the two newspapers on January 12th, holding high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly implemented Chairman Mao's correct policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and dealt another heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic trend. In addition, these two newspapers also selected many big-character posters from revolutionary rebel organizations, fully mobilizing the revolutionary rebels throughout the city to take immediate action to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. The two newspapers also published reports of factory revolutionary rebels uniting with the broad revolutionary masses, daring to withstand the trend, fearing no encirclement or suppression, daring to shoulder the double burden of revolution and production. These reports have clear guiding significance for the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Shanghai region.

In terms of the layout of the pages, the two newspapers have also made some improvements and innovations in the past few days, breaking some old frameworks. They have given extremely prominent treatment to articles and reports that embody the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, with clear positions, sharp edges, and a bold style. What to support and what to oppose are clearly stated, without any hesitation.

The stubborn elements within the two newspapers who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have been sidelined. They thought that without them, nothing could be done. However, the revolutionary rebels do not believe in this. They unite with the revolutionary masses within the newspaper and, with the support of the revolutionary rebels outside the newspaper and the broad revolutionary masses, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, making the revolutionary *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* better and better.

Revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses across the country have given the warmest welcome to the rebirth of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily*! In the past few days, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai have been drumming and gonging, from early morning until midnight, sending congratulations and celebrating the good news of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily*. Many major buildings in Shanghai have hung large banners such as "Firmly support the revolutionary actions of the rebel faction of *Wenhui Bao*!" and "Warmly welcome the rebirth of *Liberation Daily*!" Revolutionary rebel organizations and revolutionary masses from East China and across the country have sent telegrams and letters of congratulations. They unanimously agree that the actions of the rebel faction of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* are very good!

Revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses from Shanghai and across the country have pointed out in their visits, telegrams, and letters of congratulations that the rebel faction of *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* has seized the leadership of the newspapers, putting the newspapers in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries, making the newspapers a stronghold for propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought. This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. *People's Daily*, *Liberation Army Daily*, Xinhua News Agency, *Guangming Daily*, and other units' revolutionary comrades, as well as revolutionary rebel organizations of many newspapers and periodicals across the country, have sent telegrams full of proletarian fighting friendship, firmly expressing their determination to work together with the revolutionary rebel faction of the newly born *Wenhui Bao* and *Liberation Daily* and with the broad revolutionary masses to firmly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Many revolutionary rebel workers, Red Guards, commune members, and cadres have said, Mao Zedong Thought is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Whatever does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought must be rebelled against, must be overthrown! The Party's newspapers, the people's newspapers, can only be strongholds for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, can only loudly proclaim the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, can only push forward the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, letting the great, invincible, brilliant, and boundless Mao Zedong Thought shine red over the entire Shanghai, the entire China, and the entire world!

    上海无产阶级革命派联合起来夺取报纸领导权紧握人民喉舌的命运
    毛主席高度称赞这是一个大革命
    新生的《文汇报》《解放日报》，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举革命的批判的旗帜，猛烈反击资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，立场鲜明，尖锐泼辣，充满了战斗气息。革命群众说：“造反报就是好！”
    新华社上海十八日电　随着上海市革命力量的发展，崭新面貌的、革命的《文汇报》和《解放日报》出现了。
    《文汇报》一月四日造反，《解放日报》一月六日造反。新生的《文汇报》和《解放日报》摆脱了罪恶的资产阶级反动路线的控制后，一扫过去那种“万马齐喑”的沉闷空气，高高举起以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，高高举起革命的批判的旗帜，向资产阶级反动路线发起了猛烈的反击。全国又一张马列主义的大字报——《告上海全市人民书》，刊载在一月五日的《文汇报》上。
    新生的《文汇报》和《解放日报》的出现，是一个大革命，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的大革命。这是上海的无产阶级革命派大联合的产物。这是我国无产阶级文化大革命发展史上的一件大事，也是我国新闻发展史上的一个伟大的创举。这两家报纸起来造反，反映了上海革命造反派的力量已经开始占据统治地位，标志着全国无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新阶段。这件大事对整个华东、对于全国各省市的无产阶级文化大革命运动的发展，一定会起巨大的推动作用。
    《文汇报》和《解放日报》的革命造反派和革命群众起来造反，绝不是偶然的。这是上海地区无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线大搏斗、大厮杀的必然结果，是无产阶级革命路线反对资产阶级反动路线的胜利产物。
    这两家报纸，本来应当高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，成为无产阶级专政的工具。但是，由于上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的控制，这两家报纸几度走上了反革命修正主义道路，对党、对人民犯下了滔天罪行。《文汇报》在一九五七年堕落成资产阶级右派分子向党猖狂进攻的工具，一九六一、一九六二年间，又成了资本主义复辟的工具。挂名为市委机关报的《解放日报》近几年来在市委和报社一小撮反革命修正主义分子的控制下，它抵制宣传毛泽东思想，攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社，鼓吹修正主义，成了党内外牛鬼蛇神的合唱团。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。《文汇报》和《解放日报》的革命左派，联合报社外的革命力量，对这两家报纸的反动路线开展了激烈的斗争。伟大领袖毛主席十分关怀他们的斗争情况。毛主席始终支持革命左派，几次扭转了《文汇报》的大方向。在毛主席的亲自领导下，从一九六五年十一月至一九六六年五月，在《文汇报》上展开了对《海瑞罢官》和《三家村》的批判，揭开了无产阶级文化大革命的序幕。《文汇报》高举起了革命的批判的旗帜。但是，从一九六六年六月一日聂元梓等同志写的全国第一张马列主义大字报广播后，《文汇报》和《解放日报》不但没有积极投入这场史无前例的文化大革命，反而顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，妄图把轰轰烈烈的群众运动打下去。它们彻头彻尾地堕落成为资产阶级对无产阶级专政的工具，成了贯彻资产阶级反动路线的反动报纸。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。事实教育了革命左派，要使报纸成为无产阶级专政工具，必须由革命左派掌握报纸领导权。报纸必须由革命左派来办。《文汇报》的革命群众，从文化大革命运动开始，就把多年来贯彻反革命修正主义路线的编委会推翻了。但由于缺乏经验，革命左派并没有直接把报纸的领导权夺过来，而是拱手让给了上海市委派来的坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。这些家伙，继续改变了报纸的方向，倒向资产阶级一边，大搞阴谋，采用新的手段，进行新的反扑，疯狂地镇压报社内外的革命造反派。他们把报社内的革命左派打成“危险分子”、“两面派”。他们在报纸上蓄意发表保守派的文章。《解放日报》的坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，把革命的红卫兵视为洪水猛兽。当红卫兵上海大专院校革命委员会的小将们起来批判《解放日报》的时候，在上海市委的一手策划下，《解放日报》、《文汇报》的老爷们却恶毒地攻击红革会，挑动群众斗群众，制造了闻名全国的“解放日报流血事件”。同时，还残酷地镇压了报社内的革命造反派。
    是可忍，孰不可忍？！压迫越厉害，反抗越剧烈。《文汇报》《解放日报》的造反派并没有屈服。他们在首都第三司令部和上海红革会革命小将等的支持下，继续奋战。在斗争最艰难的时刻，《文汇报》“星火燎原”革命造反总部坚持斗争的八位同志，在毛主席像前庄严地宣誓：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们说，我们现在是少数，但真理在我们这一边，毛主席支持我们。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席给了他们以无穷无尽的力量。他们怀着必胜的信念，投入了更艰巨的斗争。两报的革命造反派工人，在斗争中表现得十分坚强，他们不怕围攻，不怕孤立，英勇斗争，一反到底，给予编辑部的革命左派以很大教育和鼓舞。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”《文汇报》的革命造反派遵循毛主席的教导，在《红旗》杂志一九六六年第十五期社论《夺取新的胜利》的鼓舞下，乘着上海地区的大好革命形势，和报社的革命工人紧密地结合起来，向报社坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固堡垒，发起了总攻击。揭发了大量事实，动员了群众，争取了多数，彻底孤立了几个顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。终于在一月三日晚上，把报社的领导权全部夺过来了。全报社绝大部分群众，全力支持“星火燎原”革命造反总部这个伟大的创举。一月四日，一张新生的《文汇报》问世了！
    《文汇报》的新生，大大地鼓舞了《解放日报》的革命造反派。他们激动地说：《解放日报》的革命，我们不干，谁干？这个权，此时不夺，更待何时！《文汇报》的新生，对《解放日报》的一小撮顽固分子是致命的打击。这个报社革命造反联合司令部同志们，抓住这一有利形势，于一月五日晚上举行大会，宣布了接管《解放日报》的决定。
    《文汇报》、《解放日报》的新生，敲响了上海市委执行的资产阶级反动路线的丧钟。
    从文化大革命的熊熊烈火中新生的《文汇报》和《解放日报》，根据毛主席“我们必须坚持真理，而真理必须旗帜鲜明”的教导，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚定地站在革命造反派一边，以猛烈的炮火，向上海市委执行的资产阶级反动路线，发起强大的攻势，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导当前的宣传报道工作。接管后第一天的《文汇报》，以一版显著地位刊载了毛主席为一九五七年七月一日《人民日报》写的社论《文汇报的资产阶级方向应当批判》。
  　由上海工人革命造反总司令部等十一个革命造反组织写的我国又一张马列主义大字报《告上海全市人民书》，在《文汇报》上出现了。这是一个极其重要的文件。这个文件，高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，吹响了继续向资产阶级反动路线猛烈反击的号角。这个文件坚决响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，提出了当前无产阶级文化大革命中的关键问题。一月九日，《人民日报》根据毛主席的指示，发表了一个极其重要的编者按。这个编者按高度评价《文汇报》和《解放日报》的造反，指出：“随着上海市革命力量的发展，崭新面貌的、革命的《文汇报》和《解放日报》出现了。这是无产阶级革命路线反对资产阶级反动路线的胜利产物。这是我国无产阶级文化大革命发展史上的一件大事。这是一个大革命。这件大事必将对于整个华东、对于全国各省市的无产阶级文化大革命运动的发展，起着巨大的推动作用。”
    新生的《文汇报》和《解放日报》积极投入了当前全国全面开展阶级斗争的洪流中去。面对着上海市委一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固派所玩弄的停生产、压革命，用物质刺激转移斗争大方向的反革命修正主义的经济主义逆流，这两家革命的报纸，连续刊登了《紧急通告》《记者述评》等重要文章，站到了批判反革命修正主义斗争的第一线。一月八日，《文汇报》在一则编者按中指出：“我们必须警惕，上海地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，他们与社会上的资本主义势力相勾结，用各种形式，诱骗一部分工人离开生产岗位，妄图用破坏生产的恶毒手法，对中央文化革命小组施加压力，达到他们反对党中央，反对毛主席，破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的。”紧接着，一月十日的《文汇报》和《解放日报》发表了《打倒经济主义》《粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑》等社论，继续给那些妄图以经济主义来腐蚀群众的一小撮人，以当头一棒。一月十二日两报刊载的《紧急通告》的十条意见，高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，坚决贯彻了毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的正确方针，又一次沉重打击了反革命修正主义的经济主义逆流。此外，这两家报纸还选载许多革命造反组织的大字报，全力动员全市的革命造反派紧急行动起来，为粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑而斗争。两报还发表了一些工厂的革命造反派团结广大革命职工，敢于顶住逆流，不怕围攻，不怕打击，敢于挑起革命和生产两副重担的报道。这些报道对上海地区无产阶级文化大革命运动的开展，有鲜明的指导意义。
    在版面的编排形式上，两报这几天也有所改进，有所创造，打破了一些陈旧的框框。他们对体现革命造反精神的文章和报道，都给予极其突出的处理，具有鲜明的立场，锐利的锋芒，泼辣的风格。赞成什么，反对什么，爽爽快快，毫不含糊。
    两报内部的一些顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子都靠边了，他们本来以为没有他们就不行。但是，革命造反派就是不信这一套，他们团结报社内部革命群众，在社外革命造反派和广大革命群众的支持下，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把革命的《文汇报》和《解放日报》越办越好。
    全国各地革命造反派和革命群众最热烈的欢呼《文汇报》和《解放日报》的新生！几天来，上海的革命群众，敲锣打鼓，从清晨直至半夜到《文汇报》和《解放日报》送喜报、祝贺的往来不绝。上海许多主要建筑物上，张贴了“最坚决地支持《文汇报》造反派的革命行动！”“热烈欢呼《解放日报》的新生！”等巨幅标语。华东和全国许多革命造反组织和革命群众发来了贺电和贺信。他们一致认为《文汇报》和《解放日报》革命造反派的行动好得很！
    上海和全国各地许多革命造反派和革命群众，在来访、贺电、贺信中指出，《文汇报》《解放日报》革命造反派夺取了报纸的领导权，把报纸掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，使报纸成为宣传毛泽东思想、保卫毛泽东思想的坚强阵地，这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。《人民日报》、《解放军报》、新华总社、《光明日报》等单位的全体革命同志，以及全国许多报刊的革命造反派组织，都发来了充满无产阶级战斗友谊的贺电，最坚决地表示，要和新生的《文汇报》和《解放日报》革命造反派共同努力，和广大革命群众一道，坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。许多革命造反派工人、红卫兵小将、公社社员、机关干部说，毛泽东思想是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，凡是不符合毛泽东思想的言行，就要造它的反，就要革它的命！党的报纸，人民的报纸，只能是宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，只能为毛主席的革命路线大喊大叫，为无产阶级文化大革命推波助澜，让伟大的、战无不胜的、光芒万丈的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想照红整个上海，整个中国，整个世界！
