	Truly Our Good Brothers

	Once, a fire broke out in the village of Bibhutidal, five kilometers away from the residence of Chinese experts assisting Nepal. Smoke billowed, and the flames were fierce. Upon seeing the fire, the Chinese experts immediately rushed to the scene and joined the local residents in putting out the blaze. They jumped into the burning houses, rescuing people, grain, and property from the flames, even saving a door panel from being burned. In this fierce battle, some of the Chinese experts were burned, and everyone's faces were blackened by the smoke, making it difficult to recognize each other.

	After the intense struggle, the fire was mostly extinguished. At this point, the Chinese experts were exhausted, hungry, and thirsty. However, Chairman Mao's teachings of wholeheartedly serving the people's interests spurred them on, and they persisted until the last ember was extinguished before leaving.

	After the fire was put out, the Nepalese residents unanimously praised, "The Chinese are truly our good brothers. Without the help of the Chinese, all our belongings would have been burned to ashes." Many Nepalese friends, moved, said to Chairman Mao's portrait, "Mao Zedong, the great leader!"

    真是我们的好兄弟
    有一次，离中国援助尼泊尔专家住处五公里的比波里达尔村发生了火灾。烟雾滚滚，火势很大。中国专家们一看见大火，立即跑到现场，同当地居民一道进行抢救。他们跳进喷射着火舌的房屋，从火口里抢救人，抢救粮食和财物，就连一块门板也不让烈火烧掉。中国专家在这场奋战中，有的人被火烧伤，所有的人面孔都被火熏黑得彼此认不出来。
    经过搏斗，一场大火基本上被制止住了。这时，中国专家已经是又饿又渴、精疲力尽了。但是，毛主席的完全、彻底为人民利益而工作的教导鞭策着中国专家，他们一直坚持到火星全部熄灭才离开。
    大火扑灭后，尼泊尔居民纷纷称赞道：“中国人真是我们的好兄弟。没有中国人的帮助，我们的东西早就全部烧光了”。许多尼泊尔朋友激动地对着毛主席的像片说：“毛泽东，伟大的领袖！”
