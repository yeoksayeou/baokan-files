Workers at Nanjing Changjiang Machinery Factory Who Were Deceived Open Their Eyes and See the Truth
Return Home and Unite with Revolutionary Rebels to Make Revolution Together

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, January 18 — A group of Red Guards from Nanjing Changjiang Machinery Factory who were deceived and left the factory have mostly opened their eyes and returned to the factory. They are determined to join the revolutionary rebels—Red Flag Combat Team—at the factory to seize the revolution, promote production, expose the plots and tricks of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieve double victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production.

Walking into Changjiang Machinery Factory, one can see declarations of withdrawal from the Red Guards and letters of determination to join the Red Flag Combat Team, as well as big-character posters welcoming fellow classmates back to Mao Zedong's revolutionary line. The Red Guards are exposing the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and those adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line who deceived and misled them over the past four months.

Worker Jiang Zhaolin, who returned to the factory, wrote in a big-character poster that he and a group of Red Guards were taken away from the factory by a handful of people with ulterior motives and housed in a middle school in the suburbs. The place was heavily guarded, and they had no freedom of movement, let alone democratic rights. The handful controlling the Red Guards also fabricated many lies to deceive local people. When their plots were about to be exposed, they secretly took the deceived workers to another commune at night, just to prevent them from returning to the factory. The workers thought of Chairman Mao's call to "seize the revolution and promote production" and wanted to return to the factory to produce as soon as possible. But those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line used threats, coercion, and bribery to obstruct them. Jiang Zhaolin said: We should stand up, expose the crimes of those behind-the-scenes plotters, break away from all selfish thoughts, be bold, correct mistakes, and unite with the revolutionary rebels to seize the revolution and promote production. We must thoroughly defeat the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and push the proletarian cultural revolution in the factory to a new high.

Original Red Guard and machinist Shen Ping, after seeing through the control of the Red Guards by a handful of people with ulterior motives, resolutely stood on the side of the revolutionary rebels. His revolutionary actions were hated by the handful controlling the Red Guards, and he was attacked three times and slandered as a "traitor." The "settle accounts later" faction threatened him, saying: In the later stage of the movement, a batch of monsters and demons will be swept out from the rebels, be careful. But Shen Ping did not waver. He said: Surrendering to the truth is glorious. To achieve victory in the cultural revolution, one must stand with the firm leftists.

An old worker who had been in the factory for twenty years joined the Red Guards when the cultural revolution began. At the instigation of a handful of people with ulterior motives, he left the factory for ten days without going to work. The Red Flag Combat Team members persuaded him patiently, finally making him realize the truth. During the more than fifty days when a group of Red Guards left the factory, the Red Flag Combat Team showed great enthusiasm and took on the full factory's production under extremely difficult conditions, exceeding the fourth quarter's production target for last year. This old worker was very moved. He said: My mind has many old frameworks, and I am afraid to rebel, following those who adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line for a detour. Now I see that the comrades of the Red Flag Combat Team are on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They listen to Chairman Mao the most, seize the revolution, and promote production. We are determined to learn from them. After returning to the factory, this old worker also persuaded two other Red Guards to return to the factory to participate in production and struggle.

    南京长江机器制造厂受蒙蔽的职工擦亮眼睛认清真理
    打回老家去和革命造反派同心合力闹革命
    新华社南京十八日电　南京长江机器制造厂一批受蒙蔽离开工厂的赤卫队员，大部分已经擦亮眼睛，纷纷回到工厂。他们决心和厂里的革命造反派——红旗战斗队的职工们一道抓革命，促生产，揭露一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的阴谋诡计，夺取无产阶级文化大革命和生产的双胜利。
    走进长江机器制造厂，可以看到到处贴着赤卫队员退出赤卫队的声明和要求参加红旗战斗队的决心书，以及红旗战斗队欢迎自己的阶级兄弟回到毛主席革命路线这边来的大字报。赤卫队员们纷纷揭露近四个月来，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的人对他们进行欺骗、蒙蔽的种种罪行。
    回厂职工蒋兆麟在一张大字报中说，他和一批赤卫队员被一小撮别有用心的人挟持离厂，住到郊区的一所中学里，那里戒备森严，行动都没有自由，更没有民主的权利。一小撮控制赤卫队的人还制造了许多谎言，欺骗当地群众。当他们的阴谋快要败露时，又偷偷地在夜里把受蒙蔽的工人带到另一个公社，就是不让回厂。工人们想到毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的号召，都想赶快回厂生产，但那些顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，又用恐吓、威逼、利诱等卑鄙手段进行阻挠。蒋兆麟说：我们应该站出来，揭露那些幕后指挥者的罪行，打破一切私心杂念，“敢”字当头，知错改错，和革命造反派同心合力抓革命促生产，彻底打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把工厂的无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新的高潮。
    原赤卫队员、车工沈萍识破赤卫队是受一小撮别有用心的坏家伙的控制后，毅然站到革命造反派一边。他的革命行动受到一小撮控制赤卫队的人的仇视，三次遭到围攻，被诬为“变节分子”。“秋后算账派”则威胁他说：到运动后期，造反派里要扫出一批牛鬼蛇神的，你当心点。但沈萍没有动摇，他说：向真理投降是光荣的，要取得文化大革命的胜利，就要和坚定的左派站在一起。
    一个进厂已经二十年的老工人，在文化大革命运动开始时参加了赤卫队。在一小撮别有用心的人的策动下，他离厂十天没有上班。红旗战斗队队员对他进行了耐心的说服，终于使他觉悟过来。在一批赤卫队员离厂五十多天的时间里，红旗战斗队发挥了冲天干劲，在极其困难的条件下，挑起了全厂的生产担子，超额完成了去年第四季度的生产任务。这位老工人很受感动。他说：我的脑子里有许多旧框框，“怕”字当头，不敢造反，跟着那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的人走了一段弯路，现在才看清了红旗战斗队的同志们是站在毛主席革命路线这一边的，他们最听毛主席的话，抓革命，促生产，我们决心向他们学习。这位老工人回厂后，还先后动员了另外两名赤卫队员回厂参加生产和斗争。
