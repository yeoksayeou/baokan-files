The China People's Association for Peace and Disarmament and the China Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee have recently received congratulatory letters from the Deputy Head of the Permanent Representative of the South Vietnam Delegation in China, Nguyen Minh Phuong, the Representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand abroad, Paron Chularat, the Chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization Office in Beijing, Rashid Khalidi, and Palestinian staff in China. They warmly congratulate China's new nuclear explosion success and enthusiastically wish the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, to achieve even more brilliant successes.

In his congratulatory letter, Nguyen Minh Phuong said, "We are extremely delighted with China's new victory and regard it as a powerful encouragement for the cause of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism for national salvation."

Paron Chularat's congratulatory letter pointed out that China's new nuclear explosion success once again proves that under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the socialist construction, scientific and technological development, and national defense construction of the Chinese people have achieved continuous leaps and bounds. The achievements of the Chinese people are another heavy blow to the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, who collude with each other to monopolize and blackmail with nuclear weapons, disrupt the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations, and attempt to dominate the world. This is a powerful and great encouragement to all revolutionary peoples around the world who are fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

Rashid Khalidi's congratulatory letter said, "The People's Republic of China's achievement of three successful nuclear tests in 1966 is the primary support for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for freedom and independence, and it greatly inspires the Palestinian people who are fighting for national liberation."

The congratulatory letter from the Palestinian staff in China pointed out that China's brilliant achievements are precisely the result of the guidance of the great leader Mao Zedong. It is the brilliant victory of this commander's thought and the fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The New China News Agency reports that various relevant people's organizations in our country have received telegrams from the General Federation of Trade Unions of Vietnam, the Vietnam Women's Union, the Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee of South Vietnam, the South Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the South Vietnam Federation of Trade Unions, and the South Vietnam Women's Liberation Union, warmly congratulating our country's new nuclear explosion success. These telegrams pointed out that the brilliant victory achieved by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China is a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists' nuclear blackmail and aggressive policies. It is a great encouragement to the struggle for liberation of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and to the revolutionary peoples of the world. It is a major contribution to the cause of safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, and it is a powerful support for the Vietnamese people who are fighting against American aggression for national salvation.

These telegrams all enthusiastically wish the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China, to achieve continuous new brilliant successes.
