Hua Junwu is a veteran of creating anti-party black paintings. His so-called internal satirical cartoons, from the 1930s to the 1960s, have a thick, stinking, and long black line running through them. Whenever class struggles intensify and he thinks the situation is favorable for him, he seizes the opportunity to shoot poisonous arrows. Sometimes he bares his fangs and claws, going into battle bare-chested, and sometimes he is subtle and indirect, hitting from the side. But whether it is an open attack or a covert one, the target of his attacks is always the Party.

After 1935, during a period of intense class struggle both domestically and internationally, Hua Junwu did not actively participate in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles. Instead, he served the bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie. In Shanghai's "Times Cartoon," he drew and drew "Miss Lucy's Curvy Life" and other works that promoted the decadent lifestyle of the bourgeoisie. He also drew reactionary cartoons for the "Student Movement Aftertaste" column, defaming the patriotic student movement. In 1938, Hua Junwu went to the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an with the intention of speculation. In 1942, when faced with severe difficulties caused by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, Hua Junwu took the opportunity to mislead people and spread dissatisfaction with the Party. He looked for the so-called "dark side" through the colored glasses of the bourgeoisie, portraying Yan'an as "utterly chaotic" and "worthless." In the same year, he collaborated with Cai Ruohong and others to hold a "Satirical Art Exhibition," in which his anti-party black paintings such as "Military-Civilian Relations," "Modern Decoration," "Line Problems," and "I Participated in the Conference" were a bundle of poisonous arrows aimed at the Party's leadership, in collaboration with Ding Ling and Wang Shih-wei's counter-revolutionary activities.

After national liberation, his bourgeois reactionary stance did not change. In 1956 and 1957, when the class struggle both domestically and internationally became acute, he jumped up and down, fanned the flames, and incited the rightists to "petition," engaging in extensive anti-party activities. He also used cartoons as a tool to attack the Party, drawing anti-party poisonous weeds such as "Meteorology," "Weathercock," and "Eagle Catching Chickens." In 1961, when our country faced temporary difficulties and domestic and foreign class enemies jointly stirred up trouble, launching an anti-China and anti-communist wave, Hua Junwu collaborated closely with the revisionist counter-revolutionaries Zhou Yang and Deng Tuo, drawing reactionary "internal satirical cartoons."

In 1961, Hua Junwu drew "Only Steering, Not Watching the Wind," which, in collaboration with the international imperialist and modern revisionist wave of anti-China and anti-communism, and the black wind stirred up by the domestic ghosts and snakes, used a ship as an analogy to attack our great helmsman, Chairman Mao, arrogantly demanding that our Party steer according to the revisionist black wind and change the direction of advancement. His other poisonous weed, "Wrong," depicts a dragon lantern, but the person leading the dragon does not lead the head but the tail, using this to curse our Party's leadership as "blind command," getting the big direction all wrong. In "Praise of the Silkworm," he again racked his brains to use the "self-entangled" "silkworm" to attack our Party's leadership. Hua Junwu was afraid that others would not understand, so he added a black poem, insulting our Party's leadership as a "lonely" individual who "speaks for me, but you have no say." His drawings of "Short Flute Without Melody," "Kite with Broken String," and "Ineffective Labor" are all poisonous weeds attacking the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes. Not only that, Hua Junwu often used the excuse of satirizing the lack of creativity in literary and artistic creation, but in reality, he fiercely opposed Mao Zedong Thought.

Hua Junwu's anti-party cartoons are a part of the counter-revolutionary clique of Zhou Yang, Deng Tuo, and others. Where is the target of Hua Junwu's black paintings? What is the reactionary theme? We can all find the answers in Zhou Yang's articles and speeches, and in Deng Tuo's "Yanshan Night Talks" and "Three Family Notes." It can be said that Hua Junwu's cartoons are the illustrations of these articles and black speeches, while Zhou Yang and Deng Tuo's black writings and speeches are the annotations and explanations of Hua Junwu's cartoons.

Zhou Yang slandered the Party's leadership of literature and art as "administrative interference," "simple and brutal," and "monopoly," so Hua Junwu drew "Scientific Division of Labor," using the image of one person playing the flute while another person closes their eyes to curse the Party's leadership of literary creation as "brutal interference," as "occupying everything and replacing everything." Zhou Yang said that our anti-revisionist struggle had been exaggerated, so Hua Junwu drew "Du Fu's Self-Criticism," using the malicious joke of "'Soldiers' March' is a peaceful thought" to mock the anti-revisionist struggle.

Deng Tuo slandered Chairman Mao's scientific judgment of "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind" as "empty talk" and "clichés," gnashing his teeth to demand that the Party's leadership "step down and rest." Hua Junwu simply drew "It's Time to Rest," cursing the Party's leadership as a patient lying in bed, suffering from "clichés" and "old sayings." One uses words, the other uses drawings, but the tone is completely the same. When Wu Han's poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was released, the big shot of the "Three Family Village," Liao Mushu, congratulated Wu Han on "breaking the doors of 'history' and 'drama,'" encouraging him to "write another Hai Rui." Hua Junwu immediately threw out the black painting "Why Not Collaborate on the Ground Floor," shouting for the "history" and "drama" families to "collaborate" to write extensive anti-party poisonous weeds. Hua Junwu's "Contradiction" also collaborated with Liao Mushu's "Fear of Ghosts' 'Elegant Jest,'" slandering the heroic Chinese people who stand at the forefront of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism as "people who claim not to be afraid of ghosts but are actually terrified of ghosts." Enough! Just from the above facts, it is sufficient to prove that when international imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries launched an anti-China chorus, and domestic ghosts and snakes came out in droves, Hua Junwu and the anti-party elements Zhou Yang, Deng Tuo, and others colluded, acting as the vanguard of the anti-party movement. The black paintings are all there, the evidence is overwhelming, and there is no way to deny or escape it.

    华君武是炮制反党黑画的老手
    红雨
    华君武是制作反党黑画的老手。他的所谓内部讽刺漫画，从三十年代到六十年代贯穿着一条又粗又臭又长的黑线。每当阶级斗争激化，他认为形势对他有利时，就乘机大放毒箭。有时他张牙舞爪，赤膊上阵，有时他又隐晦曲折，旁敲侧击。但不论是明枪或是暗箭，其攻击的矛头都是指向党的。一九三五年以后，正是国内外阶级斗争激烈的年代，华君武不积极表现反帝反封建的斗争，却为官僚买办资产阶级服务。他在上海《时代漫画》上大画特画《露茜小姐的曲线生活》等宣扬资产阶级腐朽生活的作品；他还为《学生运动余味录》专栏画诬蔑学生爱国运动的反动漫画。一九三八年，华君武抱着投机的目的跑到了革命圣地——延安。一九四二年在日寇和国民党造成的严重困难面前，华君武就乘机蛊惑人心，散布对党的不满情绪。他透过资产阶级的有色眼镜到处搜寻所谓“黑暗面”，把延安描画得“乌七八糟”，“一无是处”。同年他伙同蔡若虹等举办“讽刺画展”，其中他画的《军民关系》、
  《摩登装饰》、《路线问题》、《我参加了大会》等反党黑画，就是与丁玲、王实味的反革命活动相配合，向党的领导恶毒攻击的集束毒箭。
    全国解放后，他的资产阶级反动立场一直没有改变。到了一九五六年和一九五七年，国内外阶级斗争尖锐化的时候，他又上窜下跳，煽风点火，鼓动右派“请愿”，大搞反党活动。他还用漫画作为反党工具，画了《气象学》、《风信鸡》、《老鹰捉小鸡》等反党的毒草。一九六一年，当我国遇到暂时困难期间，国内外阶级敌人一起兴风作浪，掀起反华反共高潮的时候，华君武和周扬、邓拓等反革命修正主义分子密切配合，大画反动的“内部讽刺漫画”。
    一九六一年，华君武画的《只顾掌舵，不顾看风》，配合国际上帝国主义和现代修正主义掀起的反华反共的浪潮，配合国内牛鬼蛇神刮起的黑风，以航船为比喻，含沙射影地攻击我们的伟大舵手毛主席，狂妄地要我们党顺着修正主义黑风使舵，改变前进的方向。他的另一棵大毒草《不对头》，画的是舞龙灯，但引龙人不领龙头却领龙尾，以此来骂我们党的领导“瞎指挥”，把大方向都搞错了。在《春蚕象赞》里，他又挖空心思地借“作茧自缚”的“春蚕”，来攻击我们党的领导。华君武生怕别人不懂，还配了一首黑诗，辱骂我们党的领导是“有我发言，无你讲话”的“孤家”寡人。他画的《短笛无腔》、《断线风筝》、《无效劳动》等，都是攻击总路线、大跃进和人民公社的大毒草。不仅如此，华君武还经常以讽刺文艺创作中墨守陈规，缺乏创造为名，而实际上是疯狂地反对毛泽东思想。
    华君武的反党漫画是周扬、邓拓等反革命集团的一个组成部分。华君武黑画的矛头指向哪里？反动主题是什么？我们都可以从周扬的文章和讲话中，从邓拓的《燕山夜话》和《三家村札记》中找到答案。可以说，华君武的漫画是这些文章和黑话的插图，而周扬、邓拓的黑文黑话又是华君武漫画的注解和说明。
    周扬诬蔑党对文艺的领导是“行政干涉”、“简单粗暴”和“垄断”，华君武就画《科学分工》，用一人吹笛别人捏眼的形象来咒骂党对文艺创作的领导是“粗暴干涉”，是“占据一切，是代替一切”。周扬说我们的反修斗争扩大化了，华君武就画《杜甫检讨》，用“‘兵车行’乃和平主义思想”这句恶毒的噱头来嘲讽反修斗争。
    邓拓诬蔑毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”的科学论断是“空话”，是“陈词滥调”，咬牙切齿地要党的领导“下台去休息”。华君武就干脆画《该休息了》，咒骂党的领导是躺在床上的病人，患的是“陈腔滥调”和“老生常谈”症。一个用文一个用画，腔调完全一致。当吴晗的《海瑞罢官》大毒草出笼后，“三家村”的大将廖沫沙祝贺吴晗“打破‘史’和‘戏’这两家的门户”，鼓励他“再写一个海瑞”时，华君武便立即抛出黑画《何不下楼合作》，叫嚷“史”家和“戏”家“合作”大写反党毒草。华君武的《矛盾》又与廖沫沙的《怕鬼的“雅谑”》相配合，诬蔑站在反帝反修最前列的英雄的中国人民，是“口称不怕鬼而实际怕鬼怕得要死的人。”够了！仅从以上列举的事实，就充分证明正当国际上帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派掀起反华合唱之时，国内牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼之日，华君武和周扬、邓拓等反党分子串通一气，充当了反党的急先锋。黑画俱在，罪证累累，是抵赖不了，逃脱不掉的。
