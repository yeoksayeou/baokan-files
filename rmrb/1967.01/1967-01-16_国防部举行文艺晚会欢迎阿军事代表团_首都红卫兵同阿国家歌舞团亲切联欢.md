Comrade Balluku, Comrade Cako, Comrade Shytula, and other Albanian comrades went on stage with Comrade Ye Jianying, Comrade Yang Chengwu, Comrade Jiang Qing, and other comrades to shake hands with the performers.

Ambassador Vasil Nataneli of Albania to China was also invited to watch the performance.

According to Xinhua News Agency, January 15th, several hundred Red Guards from the capital gathered with their Albanian comrades from the Albanian National Song and Dance Troupe this evening, expressing their determination to stand together, fight together, and win together in the common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism.

At the gathering, Comrade Ye Jianying, Comrade Yang Chengwu, and Comrade Jiang Qing accompanied Comrade Bekir Balluku, leader of the Albanian military delegation visiting our country, Comrade Hito Cako, deputy leader, as well as Comrade Behar Shytula, Ambassador Vasil Nataneli of Albania to China, and other members of the Albanian military delegation to visit everyone. When they arrived at the gathering hall, the entire venue was filled with excitement and joy. Shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" echoed through the hall. At this moment, some Red Guards rushed forward to present red "Red Guards" armbands to Comrade Balluku and other Albanian comrades and enthusiastically shouted "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong." Comrade Balluku, wearing the "Red Guards" armband, enthusiastically shouted "Long live the Chinese Red Guards!" An Albanian performer tightly held Comrade Jiang Qing's hand, loudly shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and asked Comrade Jiang Qing to convey his greetings to the beloved leader Chairman Mao.

The second-floor grand hall of the Great Hall of the People was filled with excitement this evening, brimming with a strong revolutionary fighting spirit. When the Albanian comrades from the frontline of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle arrived at the gathering hall, the entire venue immediately resonated with the stirring songs "The East Is Red" and "Tirana—Beijing." Many Red Guards held up red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and red "Red Guards" armbands, presenting them to the Albanian comrades. The Albanian comrades were deeply moved, waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouting in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Several Albanian performers opened their quotation books, tears welling up in their eyes, gazing for a long time at the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao.

At the beginning of the gathering, representatives from the Red Guards and the leader of the Albanian National Song and Dance Troupe, B. Pejo, spoke. The Red Guards' representative enthusiastically praised the glorious Party of Labor of Albania led by Comrade Enver Hoxha as a giant with iron bones, who has cleared away layer upon layer of mist and withstood the counter-revolutionary revisionist current, steering the socialist ship of Albania along the Marxist-Leninist course to victory. He said: "Socialist Albania, standing tall amidst the encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism, is the glory and pride of us revolutionary Red Guards, the people of all China, and revolutionary people all over the world! The revolutionary spirit of the heroic Albanian people will forever be a good example for us Chinese people and revolutionary Red Guards to learn from!"

Comrade B. Pejo, in his speech, said that the current Cultural Revolution in China is at a new and higher stage. We have seen with our own eyes that the workers, peasants, and revolutionary youth are actively participating in this Cultural Revolution. This great revolution of yours is a great school. Your broad masses, especially the revolutionary youth, will be tempered in this revolution. He said that in your proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new thing has emerged—the Red Guards. You Red Guards are learning and mastering Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. You Red Guards, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, are using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, tempering yourselves in the struggle to become revolutionaries. We, the people and youth of Albania, are happy about the achievements you have made in the Cultural Revolution and sincerely wish you the greatest success.

In the evening filled with deep revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, the revolutionary rebels of the capital sang and danced with their Albanian artistic comrades, enthusiastically praising our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and the beloved leader of the Albanian people and close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. The Red Guards' wonderful performances expressed their firm resolve to always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, their firm determination to always be loyal to Chairman Mao and to be faithful red revolutionary successors, earning enthusiastic applause from the Albanian comrades. The Red Guards also specially created song and dance performances praising the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people. A group of female warriors sang in the song "Salute to You, Albania": "You are the socialist beacon of Europe, you are the towering mountain, the people are the toughest, you stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. You advance to victory despite difficulties, and people all over the world enthusiastically sing your glorious name."

The Albanian artistic comrades performed many wonderful performances full of revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit with great revolutionary passion.

The warm and friendly gathering lasted for more than three hours. When the revolutionary young people of the capital saw off the Albanian comrades, they sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" again and again, shouting "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong" over and over.
