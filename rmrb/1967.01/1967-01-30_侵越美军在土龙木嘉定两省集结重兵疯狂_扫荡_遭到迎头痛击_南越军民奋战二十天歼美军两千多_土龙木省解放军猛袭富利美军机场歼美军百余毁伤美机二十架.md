U.S. invaders in Tuyen Duc and Gia Dinh provinces have suffered heavy losses in their "sweeping" operations. The military and civilian population of South Vietnam have fought bravely for twenty days, annihilating over two thousand U.S. troops. The liberation army in Tuyen Duc province has launched a fierce attack on the U.S. military airfield at Phu Loi, killing and wounding over one hundred U.S. troops and destroying or damaging twenty aircraft.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, January 29th - According to the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, from January 2nd to 21st, the military and civilian population of Tuyen Duc and Gia Dinh provinces bravely counterattacked a large-scale "sweeping" operation by over thirty thousand enemy troops, annihilating 2,500 U.S. invaders, 54 New Zealand mercenaries, and 31 puppet soldiers. They also destroyed or severely damaged 132 M-41 tanks and M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, and 15 other military vehicles, and shot down or damaged 28 enemy aircraft.

	The report states that starting from January 2nd, the U.S. invaders dispatched over thirty thousand U.S. and puppet troops, along with mercenaries, to launch large-scale "sweeping" operations in the southern and northern parts of the border areas of Tuyen Duc province and some regions of the ancient district of Gia Dinh province. The enemy's "three lights" policy of burning, killing, and destroying everything in their path has resulted in extremely barbaric crimes.

	Facing the inhuman and brutal actions of the U.S. aggressors, the local military and civilian population were filled with indignation and united to bravely fight back, annihilating a large number of U.S. invaders. During this period, the military and civilian population of the southern parts of the border and oil wells in Tuyen Duc province alone annihilated 1,265 U.S. invaders, 54 New Zealand mercenaries, and 31 puppet soldiers. They also destroyed or severely damaged 72 M-41 tanks and M-113 amphibious armored vehicles, and shot down or destroyed 12 enemy aircraft.

	The U.S. invaders who launched "sweeping" operations in the ancient district of Gia Dinh province also suffered heavy losses from the local military and civilian population. The guerrilla forces in the Chau An area of Gia Dinh province set up a minefield during the battle, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy and annihilating over 200 U.S. invaders. They also destroyed or damaged 54 M-41 tanks and M-113 amphibious armored vehicles. In another battle, the guerrilla forces in this area annihilated over 100 U.S. invaders, shot down 8 helicopters, and sank 2 landing boats. Many U.S. soldiers were so frightened by the guerrilla forces that they fled in disarray at the sound of gunfire.

	According to another report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, from December 20th of last year to mid-January of this year, the liberation armed forces and guerrilla forces in Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces launched continuous attacks, annihilating over 500 enemy troops, including over 230 U.S. invaders, and seizing a large amount of weapons.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi, January 29th - According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, to support the military and civilian population of Tuyen Duc and Gia Dinh provinces in crushing the large-scale "sweeping" operation by over thirty thousand enemy troops, the liberation armed forces of Tuyen Duc province launched a fierce attack on the U.S. military airfield at Phu Loi on January 26th, achieving a brilliant victory by killing and wounding 165 U.S. invaders and destroying or severely damaging 20 helicopters.

	The liberation armed forces' artillery accurately hit the enemy's airfield, barracks, and artillery positions, turning the entire Phu Loi airfield into a sea of fire. At the same time, the liberation armed forces also shelled a command post of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division nearby, causing heavy losses to the enemy.

	This is the fourth attack by the liberation armed forces of Tuyen Duc province on the U.S. military airfield at Phu Loi. Including the attacks on January 30th, February 24th, and May 25th of last year, the liberation armed forces have destroyed or damaged 109 enemy aircraft and annihilated 597 U.S. invaders.

　　南越军民奋战二十天歼美军两千多
　　土龙木省解放军猛袭富利美军机场歼美军百余毁伤美机二十架
    新华社河内二十九日电　据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方土龙木和嘉定两省军民，从一月二日到二十一日，英勇反击三万多敌军发动的大规模“扫荡”，消灭美国侵略军两千五百多名、新西兰帮凶军五十四名、伪军三十一名，击毁和严重击伤Ｍ—41型坦克和Ｍ—113型两栖装甲车一百三十二辆、其他军车十五辆，击落击伤敌机二十八架。
    报道说，从一月二日起，美国侵略者派遣三万多名美伪军和帮凶军，对土龙木省边蓄县南部和北部，以及嘉定省古芝县的一些地区，发动大规模“扫荡”。敌人所到之处，实行烧光、杀光、毁光“三光”政策，犯下了极其野蛮的罪行。
    面对着美国强盗惨无人道的残暴行动，当地军民义愤填膺，一致奋起英勇杀敌，歼灭了大量美国侵略军。在这期间，仅土龙木省边蓄和油汀南部地区军民就消灭美国侵略军一千二百六十五名、新西兰帮凶军五十四名、伪军三十一名，击毁和严重击伤Ｍ—41型坦克和Ｍ—113型两栖装甲车七十二辆，击落击毁敌机十二架。
    对嘉定省古芝县发动“扫荡”的美国侵略军，同样遭到了当地军民的沉重打击。嘉定省忠安地区游击队在战斗中大摆地雷阵，狠狠打击敌人，消灭美国侵略军二百多名，击毁击伤Ｍ—41型坦克和Ｍ—113型两栖装甲车五十四辆。在另一次战斗中，这个区的游击队还消灭美国侵略军一百多名，击落直升飞机八架，击沉登陆艇两艘。许多美军士兵被游击队打得魂飞魄散。他们一听到游击队的枪声，就狼狈四散逃命。
    另据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广治省和承天省解放武装力量和游击队，从去年十二月二十日到今年一月中旬，连续出击，共歼灭敌人五百多名，其中包括美国侵略军二百三十多名，并且缴获大批武器。
    新华社河内二十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方土龙木省解放武装力量，为了配合土龙木和嘉定两省军民粉碎三万名敌军发动的大规模“扫荡”，一月二十六日猛烈袭击土龙木省富利美军机场，取得了打死打伤美国侵略军一百六十五名、击毁和严重击伤直升飞机二十架的辉煌战果。
    解放武装力量的炮火准确地击中了美军的机场、兵营和炮兵阵地。整个富利机场变成了一片火海。同时，解放武装力量还炮轰了附近的美国第一步兵师一个旅的指挥部，使敌人遭到了损失。
    这是土龙木省解放武装力量对富利美军机场发起的第四次袭击。连同去年一月三十日、二月二十四日和五月二十五日的袭击，解放武装力量共击毁和击伤敌机一百零九架，消灭美国侵略军五百九十七名。（附图片）
