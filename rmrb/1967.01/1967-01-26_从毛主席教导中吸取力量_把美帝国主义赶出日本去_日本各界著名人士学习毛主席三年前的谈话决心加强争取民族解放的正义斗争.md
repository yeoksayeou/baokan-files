	Drawing Strength from Chairman Mao's Teachings to Drive Out U.S. Imperialism from Japan

	Japanese Prominent Figures from Various Circles Study Chairman Mao's Speech Three Years Ago and Resolve to Intensify the Just Struggle for National Liberation

	BEIJING, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) — Tokyo: Japanese prominent figures from various circles have recently stated that Chairman Mao's speech three years ago, "Support the Japanese People's Anti-U.S. Patriotic Just Struggle," has greatly inspired the Japanese people's struggle for national independence. They expressed their determination to study the great Mao Zedong Thought thoroughly, form a broad anti-U.S. united front, and push the struggle against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism to new heights.

	Fukao Kunihiko, Secretary-General of the Japanese Federation of Publishers and Booksellers Union, said: Chairman Mao's speech on January 27, 1964, is the greatest encouragement to the Japanese people in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and for an independent, democratic, peaceful, and neutral Japan. It has given the Japanese people great courage.

	Fukao said, the practice of the past three years has proven that Chairman Mao's speech is the truth, making us more convinced that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest Marxism-Leninism of our time. We must master the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the unity of the peoples of Japan and China, Asia, and the world, and bravely fight against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, marching towards new victories.

	Nakajima Kenzo, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, said, the great helmsman of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, issued a speech supporting the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle, greatly inspiring the fighting spirit of the Japanese people. He said, now U.S. imperialism is riding roughshod over the Japanese people, and the Japanese people absolutely cannot allow this situation to continue. We must unite the vast majority of the Japanese people and drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan completely.

	Sakamoto Tokumatsu, Chairman of the Japan Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, pointed out that in the current fierce two-line struggle within the Japanese anti-U.S. movement, the significance of Chairman Mao's speech is even more prominent. Sakamoto said, U.S. imperialism is not only the most vicious enemy of the Japanese people but also the most vicious enemy of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. Therefore, to defeat this most vicious enemy, we must form a broad united front against U.S. imperialism. Sakamoto pointed out that there are some people in Japan who avoid fighting against the most vicious enemy, U.S. imperialism, and instead, they constantly sabotage the unity of the peoples of Japan and China and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He stressed that the Japanese people must learn from the revolutionary experience of the Chinese people and push the anti-U.S. struggle to a higher stage. As Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech, drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan, out of the Western Pacific, out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

	A leader of the Japanese women's movement, Nakajima Chiyoko, highly praised the great significance of Chairman Mao's speech three years ago, "Support the Japanese People's Anti-U.S. Patriotic Just Struggle," to the Japanese people's struggle for independence.

	She stressed that we must strive to study Chairman Mao's works to draw strength from them. She said, the Japanese people must form an anti-U.S. patriotic united front and completely, thoroughly, and cleanly drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan.

	Kawamoto Tsutomu, Chairman of the Ehime Prefecture (orthodox) Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, said: Chairman Mao's speech has helped the Japanese people distinguish between true enemies and true friends. A small handful of people who talk about Marxism-Leninism but actually go against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are trying to sabotage the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle, but this is in vain. Their true colors have been exposed in the Japan-China friendship movement, and they are being spit on by the Japanese people. The Japanese people are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and continue the struggle until U.S. imperialism is driven out of Japan.

	Japanese labor movement leader Takano Minoru, Chairman of the Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers, Chairman of the orthodox Japan-China Friendship Association, leftist leader of the Japanese Socialist Party Kato Takeshi, President of Ritsumeikan University Suematsu Hiroshi, Waseda University Professor Ando Hitoshi, and manager of the Oriental Bookstore Yasui Masayuki all made speeches praising the great significance of Chairman Mao's speech, "Support the Japanese People's Anti-U.S. Patriotic Just Struggle," and emphasized in the struggle to hold high the anti-U.S. banner, form a broad anti-U.S. united front, and more powerfully launch the struggle against U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism and their followers.

    从毛主席教导中吸取力量
    把美帝国主义赶出日本去
　　日本各界著名人士学习毛主席三年前的谈话决心加强争取民族解放的正义斗争
    新华社二十五日讯　东京消息：日本各界著名人士最近发表谈话指出，毛主席在三年前发表的《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》，大大地鼓舞了日本人民争取民族独立的斗争。他们表示决心学好伟大的毛泽东思想，结成广泛的反美统一战线，把反对美帝和现代修正主义的斗争推向新高潮。
    日本出版工会协议会书记长饭冈邦辅说：毛主席在一九六四年一月二十七日发表的这一谈话，是对反对美帝及其走狗和争取独立、民主、和平、中立的日本人民的最大鼓舞，给日本人民增强了勇气。
    饭冈说，三年来的实践证明，毛主席的这一谈话是真理，使我们更加相信毛泽东思想是当代最高的马克思列宁主义。我们一定要把战无不胜的毛泽东思想学到手，加强日中两国人民、亚洲人民和全世界人民的团结，勇敢地同美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派进行斗争，向着新的胜利迈进。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏说，中国人民的伟大舵手毛主席发表谈话支持日本人民的反美爱国斗争，大大地鼓舞了日本人民的斗志。他说，现在美帝国主义骑在日本人民头上，日本人民绝对不能允许这种状态继续存在。我们要把绝大多数的日本人民团结起来，把美帝国主义从日本完全赶出去。
    亚非人民团结日本委员会理事长坂本德松指出，在日本的反美运动中进行着非常激烈的两条路线斗争的情况下，毛主席的这一谈话的意义更加显得重要了。坂本说，美帝国主义不仅是日本人民的最凶恶敌人，也是全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的最凶恶的敌人。因此，为了打倒这个最凶恶的敌人，必须结成反对美帝国主义的广泛统一战线。坂本指出，日本有一部分人，他们避开同最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义进行斗争，他们一个劲地破坏日中两国人民和亚非拉人民的团结。他强调指出，日本人民要学习中国人民的革命经验，把反美斗争推向更高的阶段。像毛主席在谈话中指出的那样，把美帝国主义从日本、从西太平洋、从亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲赶出去。
    日本妇女运动的一位领导人中岛千代高度评价毛主席三年前发表的《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》对日本人民争取独立运动的伟大意义。
    她强调说，我们要努力学习毛主席著作，以便从中吸取力量。她说，日本人民要结成反美爱国统一战线，把美帝国主义完全彻底干净地从日本驱逐出去。
    日中友好协会爱媛县（正统）总部理事长河本务说：毛主席的谈话使日本人民分清了谁是真正的敌人，谁是真正的朋友。一小撮口头上讲马克思列宁主义实际上违背马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的人，企图破坏日本人民的反美爱国斗争，但这是枉费心机，他们的丑态已经在日中友好运动中暴露出来，他们正在被日本人民所唾弃。日本人民决心按照毛主席教导，继续斗争，直到把美帝国主义赶出日本。
    日本工人运动领导人高野实、日本记者同盟主席小林雄一、日中友好协会（正统）总部理事长宫崎世民、日本社会党左派领导人加藤长雄、立命馆大学校长末川博、早稻田大学教授安藤彦太郎以及东方书店经理安井正幸都发表谈话，歌颂毛主席《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》的伟大意义，并且强调在斗争中高举反美旗帜，结成广泛的反美统一战线，更有力地展开反对美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义及其追随者的斗争。
