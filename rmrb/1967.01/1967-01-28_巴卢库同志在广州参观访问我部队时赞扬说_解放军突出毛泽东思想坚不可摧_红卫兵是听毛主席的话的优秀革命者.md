A military delegation from Albania led by Bekir Baluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense, and Hito Cako, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour and Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, visited and inspected a unit of the Guangzhou Military Region. They were accompanied by Wang Shousheng, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Minister of Defense, and responsible officials from the Guangzhou Military Region. The delegation received a warm welcome from the officers and soldiers.

Comrade Baluku and others in this unit showed great enthusiasm and interest in understanding the political and ideological work of this unit. They held a discussion with active learners of Chairman Mao's works, visited some exemplary companies, observed military demonstrations, and inspected political training camps. After the political department of a certain regiment introduced the situation of handling sixty "what to do" issues in active thinking, Comrade Baluku said, "Handling sixty 'what to do' issues in active thinking runs through a red line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which is to learn from the masses and then educate the masses. This is a very beneficial experience. It is a lively revolutionary method, not a superficial metaphysical trivial philosophy. Through political and ideological work, you educate the youth with class education and cultivate new people with Mao Zedong Thought. We are very pleased. It can be imagined that if soldiers, workers, and peasants are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, our cause will be invincible and will forever advance."

After watching the military demonstration, Comrade Baluku said, "The Chinese People's Liberation Army is called an invincible and powerful force because it studies the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, emphasizes Mao Zedong Thought, and uses Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, becoming a highly politically conscious army. Under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, all officers and soldiers become a powerful and steadfast army, a strong bulwark for defending the country and the revolution."

Comrade Cako had a cordial conversation with some active learners of Chairman Mao's works in this unit and enthusiastically praised the unit's achievements in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

During their visit to this unit, the Albanian comrades had meals with the soldiers, chatted with them, and engaged in recreational activities together. Comrade Baluku personally led the officers and soldiers in singing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman," filling the camp with a festive atmosphere.

The Albanian military delegation, led by Bekir Baluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, Vice Premier and Minister of Defense, and Hito Cako, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour and Director of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army, met with a Red Guard Long March team passing through a certain unit's garrison on January 26. Comrade Baluku highly praised the Red Guards and gave an enthusiastic speech to the Red Guard youths.

Comrade Baluku said, "The Red Guards are excellent revolutionaries who act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and listen to Chairman Mao's words. The Red Guards turn Mao Zedong Thought into material force and are a powerful reserve force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a great force."

Comrade Baluku enthusiastically praised the Red Guards for their firm adherence to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "You have not disappointed Comrade Mao Zedong. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, you love the great Chairman Mao infinitely, and you contribute your strength to building socialism and communism, making the red flag of Marxism-Leninism forever fly high in your country. The Red Guard soldiers have well and accurately executed Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary path, defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. You are Chairman Mao's Red Guards, outstanding warriors against bourgeois ideology and bourgeois habits!"

In his speech, Comrade Baluku also enthusiastically praised the Red Guards' spirit of hard work and fearlessness in the face of difficulties. He encouraged the Red Guards, saying, "Be as hardworking and frugal as your people, your party, and the great leader Comrade Mao Zedong. Serve the people, love the people, hate the enemy, and fight against the enemy. Sweep away all ghosts and monsters. Pointing to a Red Guard soldier holding a 'Little Red Book,' Comrade Baluku shouted, 'You are true revolutionaries. With high awareness, you promote this red book and promote Mao Zedong Thought. You are an example for the youth of all countries. Revolutionary youth around the world support you and learn from you. You should be proud of this.'"

While Comrade Baluku was giving this passionate speech full of revolutionary spirit, the Red Guard youths repeatedly shouted slogans and burst into thunderous applause. Many Red Guard youths rushed forward to present their most cherished Chairman Mao badges and photos of Chairman Mao inspecting the Red Guards to Comrade Baluku, Comrade Cako, and the delegation members. They also pinned Red Guard armbands on Comrade Baluku and others. Finally, Comrade Baluku shook hands warmly with the Red Guard youths, led them in singing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman," and shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The Red Guard youths also raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

　　巴卢库同志在广州参观访问我部队时赞扬说
　　解放军突出毛泽东思想坚不可摧
　　红卫兵是听毛主席的话的优秀革命者
    据新华社广州二十六日电　由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团，在中共中央委员、国防部副部长王树声和广州部队负责人陪同下，连日来在广州部队某部参观访问，受到指战员们极其热烈的欢迎。
    巴卢库等同志在这个部队，以极大的热情和兴趣了解了这个部队思想政治工作，同学习毛主席著作积极分子进行了座谈，访问了一些四好连队，参观了军事项目表演和连队政治野营。当这个部队某团政治处负责同志介绍了抓活思想的六十个怎么办的情况后，巴卢库同志说，抓活思想六十个怎么办贯穿着一条马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的红线，就是向群众学习，转过来又教育群众，这是一个很有益的经验。这是生动的革命的方法，而不是那种表面的形而上学的烦琐哲学的方法。你们通过政治思想工作，向青年进行阶级教育，用毛泽东思想培养了新人，我们很高兴。可以设想，用毛泽东思想武装了战士、工人和农民，我们的事业就无往而不胜，就永远前进。
    巴卢库同志在观看了军事项目表演后说，中国人民解放军所以称为坚不可摧的强大的力量，是因为学习毛泽东同志的著作，突出了毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想挂帅，成为一支具有高度政治思想的军队。全体指战员在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，成为顶天立地的、坚如磐石的强大的军队，成为保卫国家、保卫革命的强大的屏障。
    恰科同志和这个部队的一部分学习毛主席著作积极分子进行了亲切的交谈，他热情地赞扬这个部队活学活用毛主席著作的成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚同志们，在这个部队访问期间，他们在连队和战士一同吃饭，一起谈心，一起娱乐。巴卢库同志亲自指挥指战员们高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，营区里洋溢着一片欢乐的气氛。
    据新华社广州二十七日电　由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团，一月二十六日在广州部队某部访问时，会见了路经某部驻地的红卫兵长征队。巴卢库同志高度赞扬红卫兵，向红卫兵小将作了热情洋溢的讲话。
    巴卢库说，红卫兵是按照毛主席的指示办事、听毛主席的话的优秀革命者。红卫兵把毛泽东思想变为物质力量，是中国人民解放军的强大的后备军，是一支巨大的力量。
    巴卢库同志热情赞扬红卫兵坚定地沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线前进，在无产阶级文化大革命中作出的贡献。他说，你们没有辜负毛泽东同志的期望，你们在毛主席的领导下，无限热爱伟大的毛泽东主席，你们为建设社会主义、建设共产主义，使你们国家的马克思列宁主义红旗永远高高地飘扬在你们国家的上空，献出你们的力量。红卫兵战士很好地、准确地执行了毛主席的指示，坚定地沿着毛主席的革命道路前进，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。你们是毛主席的红卫兵，是反对资产阶级思想和资产阶级习惯的杰出战士！
    巴卢库同志在讲话中，还热情称赞红卫兵艰苦朴素和不怕任何困难的革命精神。他勉励红卫兵说，要像你们的人民，你们党和伟大领袖毛泽东同志那样艰苦朴素，按照毛主席的教导为人民服务，热爱人民，仇恨敌人，对敌人展开斗争，坚决横扫一切牛鬼蛇神。巴卢库同志指着一位红卫兵战士手中的《毛主席语录》高声地说，你们是真正的革命者，你们以高度的觉悟宣传这本红书，宣传毛泽东思想。你们是各国青年的榜样，各国革命的青年都在支持你们，向你们学习，你们应该为此感到自豪。
    巴卢库同志在作这番充满革命热情的讲话时，红卫兵小将们不断高呼口号，爆发出一阵阵雷鸣般的掌声。许多红卫兵小将拥上前去，把自己最心爱的毛主席像章、毛主席检阅红卫兵的像片送给巴卢库同志、恰科同志和代表团的同志们，还给巴卢库等同志佩戴了红卫兵袖章。最后巴卢库和红卫兵小将热烈握手，指挥红卫兵小将们高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，并且用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”红卫兵小将也振臂高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”
