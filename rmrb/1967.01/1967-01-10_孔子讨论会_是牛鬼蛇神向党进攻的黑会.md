The "Confucius Discussion Meeting" is a black meeting of monsters and demons attacking the Party

Editor's Note: In 1940, Chairman Mao pointed out: "In China, there is also semi-feudal culture, which reflects semi-feudal politics and semi-feudal economy. All those who advocate the worship of Confucius and the study of classics, promote old ethics and old thoughts, and oppose new culture and new thoughts are representatives of this kind of culture." For more than two thousand years, the reactionary ruling class in China has portrayed Confucius as a "saint," using reactionary Confucian thought to deceive and fool the working people, in order to maintain and consolidate their ruling position. Confucian thought has become a heavy spiritual shackle on the heads of the working people.

After national liberation, the overthrown exploiting class and their agents in the revolutionary ranks have, in order to restore their lost "paradise," used every means to maintain and spread feudal class old thoughts and old culture in the ideological realm. They allow emperors, generals, talents, and beauties to occupy our cultural positions. They also combine capitalist and revisionist thoughts and cultures with feudalist thoughts and cultures to launch a wanton attack on the Party and socialism, poisoning the working people. The counter-revolutionary revisionist elements led by Zhou Yang, together with bourgeois reactionary "authorities," held the "Confucius Discussion Meeting," openly advocating "reverence for Confucius and restoration of the old," which is a major crime in their activities to restore capitalism.

In our socialist New China, there must be no place for Confucian thought serving the exploiting class, as well as capitalist and revisionist thoughts to stand. Unless they are uprooted, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated, and socialism and communism cannot be built. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, overthrowing the feudal corpse of Confucius and thoroughly eliminating the extremely reactionary Confucian thought is one of our important tasks. A group of Red Guards have become the vanguard in smashing Confucian thought, and they have achieved great success in this regard in close cooperation with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow and smash to pieces the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and bourgeois reactionary "authorities," and sweep all the old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting class into the dustbin of history.

In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Beijing Normal University Red Guards Mao Zedong Thought Jigangshan Combat Team, with the determination to defend Chairman Mao and uphold the absolute authority of great Mao Zedong Thought, went to Qufu, Shandong, to smash the feudal stronghold of the Kong family store. Confucius is the ancestor of extremely reactionary Confucian thought, and class enemies always want to use "reverence for Confucius and restoration of the old" to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration.

In September 1962, the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was held. Chairman Mao once again sounded the alarm to the whole country: Never forget class struggle.

From November 6 to 12, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois reactionary "experts" and "authorities," after careful planning, held a "Confucius Discussion Meeting" in Shandong under the pretext of commemorating the 2,440th anniversary of Confucius's death. This was a major black meeting of the bourgeois rightists to counterattack the revolutionary spirit of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, a major black meeting to wantonly attack Mao Zedong Thought, the socialist system, and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a government, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." For more than a decade since liberation, the overthrown exploiting class, in order to achieve the goal of restoring capitalism, has never stopped creating public opinion. The "Confucius Discussion Meeting" was an unprecedented public and wanton gathering to create counter-revolutionary public opinion.

This meeting was nominally initiated and convened by the Shandong Historical Society and the Shandong Historical Research Institute, but in reality, the counter-revolutionary two-faced person Zhou Yang was its backstage boss. At this meeting, Liu Daosheng, Yu Xiu, Feng Youlan, Lü Zhenyao, Li Jingchun, Jin Jingfang, Gao Zhanfei, and other big and small monsters and demons and bourgeois reactionary "experts" and "authorities" waved flags and shouted slogans, shooting poisonous arrows, and evil clouds and poisonous mists spread everywhere. After the meeting, these bad guys went to Qufu to "pay homage," kneeling and kowtowing to the idol of the feudal ancestor Confucius, performing the biggest "reverence for Confucius" farce since liberation.

At the "Confucius Discussion Meeting," the bourgeois rightists went all out to elevate the feudal corpse of Confucius, beautifying this feudal ancestor and praising him to the skies. They fabricated that "Confucius is a great philosopher, politician, and educator in ancient times, with no exaggeration," and that the word "great" can be fully applied to Confucius. They said that Confucius's "theories" have been nurturing our great nation and great people, inspiring them to persist in "justice" in the face of dark rule. They said that human happiness is related to Confucius's words. They even said that dialectical materialism "seems like a red thread running through Confucius's life," and that Confucius's thought is "the spirit of Marxism and Leninism." They said that "some of Confucius's theories still shine today." They attempted to impose this most reactionary Confucian thought, which the exploiting class has used for thousands of years to rule and oppress the working people, back onto the working people, creating public opinion to prepare for their capitalist restoration.

The monsters and demons who participated in the "Confucius Discussion Meeting" worked so hard to put gold on the face of the feudal corpse of Confucius, aiming to oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat, with a population of 700 million. It needs a unified thought, a revolutionary thought, a correct thought, which is Mao Zedong Thought." However, these monsters and demons attempted to replace the revolutionary truth of the proletariat with reactionary feudal theory. They said that "basically, people have long taken the books compiled by Confucius as classics... In fact, people have had a unified center, and from then on, everyone has had a common language, common thought, common feelings, and common living habits. How important this is for the formation and unity of the Chinese nation!" They also said that "Confucius has become the representative of Chinese national culture and the center of unified Chinese national thought." It is clear that they maliciously slandered Mao Zedong Thought and attempted to replace Mao Zedong Thought with Confucian thought, which is absolutely impossible, ten thousand times impossible.

Chairman Mao is the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in our time, the greatest genius of our era. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the revolutionary people. We must establish Mao Zedong Thought and uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, we will rebel against them, overthrow them, and trample them underfoot, making them never able to rise again.

The monsters and demons who participated in the "Confucius Discussion Meeting" also loudly advocated "benevolent rule" and "rule by virtue," attacking the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and openly inciting counter-revolutionary restoration. They shouted loudly that "benevolent people love people," saying that Confucius's "benevolence" is "for all the people." They advocated that "if people practice this kind of morality, there will be no struggle on earth." They said that "people should live in harmony, you should not suspect me, I should not deceive you, we should interact with tolerance, love each other, and embrace each other."

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "There is no love without reason in the world, nor is there hatred without reason. As for the so-called 'love of mankind,' since the division of mankind into classes, there has been no such unified love. All the ruling classes in the past liked to advocate this thing, and many so-called saints and sages also liked to advocate this thing, but no one has truly practiced it, because it is impossible to practice it in a class society." Looking at the faces of these monsters and demons with Chairman Mao's words, we can see that the "benevolent rule" and "rule by virtue" they advocate is to confuse class boundaries and reconcile class contradictions. Their clichés are nothing but a version of Khrushchev's revisionist "whole people's party" and "whole people's state."

At this meeting, the monsters and demons blatantly attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat as "not benevolent," saying that the dictatorship of the proletariat "has intentionally or unintentionally infringed upon the survival of others." These bourgeois rightists dream of using "benevolence" to undermine our dictatorship of the proletariat, which is absolutely impossible. This is like "ants shaking a big tree, laughably overestimating oneself." We must not apply "benevolent rule" to class enemies; we must only allow them to behave properly and not allow them to speak or act recklessly. If they speak or act recklessly, we must immediately suppress and punish them.

Viciously attacking the Party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes is another crime of the monsters and demons who participated in the "Confucius Discussion Meeting." They are in cahoots with right-opportunists within the Party, cheering for and rehabilitating right-opportunist elements. They cursed our Party for being "arrogant," "pretending to know when they don't," attacking our Party for "issuing orders recklessly in confusion and ignorance," as "chaotic and reckless." They maliciously cursed us for "bringing greater errors and greater disasters," saying that it is "not sustainable." They gnashed their teeth, wishing for our "collapse" and "tears like rain." However, their clamor is nothing but barking at the sun, to no avail. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the great achievements of our people under the guidance of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes are indisputable. In the face of the great three red banners, the people of the whole country cheer in unison, and all reactionaries can only weep in the corner.

It is not surprising that these monsters and demons staged this "reverence for Confucius" farce in socialist New China. History tells us that for more than two thousand years, the reactionary exploiting class in China has always used Confucian thought to serve them. When they were in power, they used Confucian thought to deceive and fool the working people to consolidate their rule. After they were overthrown, they wanted to bring out the feudal corpse of Confucius again, attempting to use its influence in society to create public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration. Without going too far back, when the traitor Yuan Shikai usurped the country and restored the empire, he launched a wave of "reverence for Confucius and restoration of the old." The reactionary warlord Zhang Xun, before restoring the Qing emperor, also flatteringly praised Confucius. The public enemy Chiang Kai-shek, to suppress the revolutionary movement and consolidate his reactionary rule, even more deified Confucius as his "ancestor." As late as 1960, Chiang Kai-shek personally appeared on stage in Taiwan to perform the farce of establishing the "Confucius and Mencius Society," shouting that this is a "comprehensive ideological war, cultural war, and war of ideology" against the Chinese people, "with very significant meaning." All this shows that Confucian thought and the feudal corpse of Confucius are beneficial to whom and welcomed by whom; it also shows that all forms of "reverence for Confucius and restoration of the old" are what kind of reactionary goods.

Today, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping away all the old thoughts, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting class with the momentum of a thunderstorm. In this great revolutionary movement, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and conduct merciless criticism of all poisonous weeds. We must overthrow Confucian thought, overthrow the feudal corpse of Confucius, thoroughly criticize all kinds of "reverence for Confucius and restoration of the old," and smash the counter-revolutionary restoration attempts of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois reactionary "authorities." We must establish Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever dares to oppose Mao Zedong Thought, whether they are human or ghost, no matter how high their position or how old their credentials, we will resolutely fight against them, overthrow them, and make them never able to rise again. Let the sun of Mao Zedong Thought forever shine upon our journey forward!

    “孔子讨论会”是牛鬼蛇神向党进攻的黑会
    北京师范大学毛泽东思想红卫兵井冈山战斗团
    编者按：毛主席在一九四○年指出：“在中国，又有半封建文化，这是反映半封建政治和半封建经济的东西，凡属主张尊孔读经、提倡旧礼教旧思想、反对新文化新思想的人们，都是这类文化的代表。”两千多年来，中国的反动统治阶级，把孔子说成是什么“圣人”，一直用反动的孔子思想来欺骗和愚弄劳动人民，以维持和巩固他们的统治地位。孔子思想成为压在劳动人民头上沉重的精神枷锁。
    全国解放以后，被推翻了的剥削阶级，和他们在革命阵营里的代理人，为了恢复他们已经失去了的“天堂”，千方百计地在意识形态领域里，维护和散布封建阶级的旧思想、旧文化。让帝王将相、才子佳人占领我们的文化阵地。他们还把资本主义、修正主义的思想文化与封建主义的思想文化结合起来，用来向党向社会主义进行猖狂的进攻，毒害劳动人民。反革命修正主义分子周扬之流，伙同资产阶级反动“权威”召开的“孔子讨论会”，公开地鼓吹“尊孔复古”，便是他们进行资本主义复辟活动的一大罪行。
    在我们社会主义的新中国，绝不能有为剥削阶级效劳的孔子思想以及资本主义、修正主义思想的立身之地。不把它们连根拔除，无产阶级专政就不能巩固，社会主义和共产主义就不能建成。在无产阶级文化大革命中，打倒孔老二这具封建僵尸，彻底铲除反动透顶的孔子思想，是我们一项重要任务。一批红卫兵小将们当了大破孔子思想的急先锋，他们在广大工农兵密切配合下，在这方面已经取得了很大的成绩。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动“权威”斗倒斗垮斗臭，把一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯统统扫进历史垃圾堆。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，我们北京师范大学毛泽东思想红卫兵井冈山战斗团，怀着保卫毛主席，捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，树立毛泽东思想绝对权威的决心，到山东曲阜，大造封建主义老巢孔家店的反。孔老二是反动透顶的儒家思想的鼻祖，阶级敌人总想利用“复古尊孔”来搞反革命复辟。
    一九六二年九月，党的八届十中全会公报发表了。毛主席在这次会上又一次向全国人民敲响了警钟：千万不要忘记阶级斗争。
    十一月六日至十二日，一小撮反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级反动“专家”、“权威”，经过周密策划，以纪念孔子逝世二千四百四十年为名，在山东开了一个“孔子讨论会”。这是资产阶级右派对党的八届十中全会革命精神进行反攻的大黑会，是对毛泽东思想，对社会主义制度和无产阶级专政的猖狂进攻的大黑会。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”解放十几年来，被推翻的剥削阶级，为达到复辟资本主义的目的，一刻也没有停止制造舆论。“孔子讨论会”就是一次前所未有的公开猖狂地制造反革命舆论的大集会。
    这个会名义上由山东历史学会和山东历史研究所发起召开，实际上，反革命两面派周扬是它的后台老板。在这次会上，刘导生、余修、冯友兰、吕振羽、李景春、金景芳、高赞非等大大小小牛鬼蛇神和资产阶级反动“专家”、“权威”，摇旗呐喊，大放毒箭，恶云毒雾一时广为弥漫。会后，这些坏家伙又到曲阜“朝圣”，对着封建祖宗孔老二的偶像顶礼膜拜，演出了解放以来最大的一次“尊孔”丑剧。
    在“孔子讨论会”上，资产阶级右派大放厥词，极力抬高孔老二这具封建僵尸，美化这个封建祖宗，把他捧上了天。他们胡诌什么“孔子是古代世界伟大的哲学家、政治家和教育家，绝无溢美”，“‘伟大’二字，完全可以加到孔子身上”。说什么孔子的“理论”“一直在哺育我们伟大民族和伟大人民，鼓舞他们在黑暗统治中，为坚持‘正义’而进行不屈的斗争”。说什么“人类的幸福，关系于孔子的一言半语”。他们还胡说什么辩证唯物主义“好像一条红线似的贯串在孔夫子一生的言论中”，孔子的思想“正是马列主义的精神”了。说什么“孔子若干理论，在今日，犹射异彩”。他们妄图把这个几千年来剥削阶级用来统治和压迫劳动人民的最反动的孔子思想，又继续压到劳动人民头上，为他们的资本主义复辟，制造舆论准备。
    参加“孔子讨论会”的牛鬼蛇神，这样煞费心机地往孔老二这具封建僵尸脸上贴金，其目的就是为了反对毛泽东思想。
    林彪同志指出：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”但是，他们这批牛鬼蛇神却妄图以反动的封建理论来代替无产阶级的革命真理。他们说什么“基本上人们长期都以孔子所编著的书籍为经典……事实上，人们已经有了统一的中心，从此，大家彼此间有了共同的语言，共同的思想，共同的感情，共同的生活习惯，这对于中国民族的形成和团结、统一的关系，该有多么重大呢？”并说“孔子成了中国民族文化的代表，成了统一中国民族思想的重心”。很明白，他们竭力诋毁毛泽东思想，妄图用孔子的思想来代替毛泽东思想，这一千个办不到，一万个办不到。
    毛主席是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是我们时代最伟大的天才。毛泽东思想是革命人民的命根子。我们要大立毛泽东思想，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。谁敢反对毛泽东思想，我们就要造他的反，把他打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他永世不得翻身。
    参加“孔子讨论会”的牛鬼蛇神还大肆鼓吹什么“仁政”、“德治”，攻击社会主义制度和无产阶级专政，公开煽动反革命复辟。他们声嘶力竭地叫嚷什么“仁者爱人”，说什么孔子的“仁”“是以全民为对象”。宣扬什么“孔子说仁义，若使人们实行此种道德，地球上就不会有什么斗争了。”什么“人与人彼此相安，尔不虞，我不诈，相交以恕，彼此相爱，互相拥抱”。
    毛主席早就指出：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。至于所谓‘人类之爱’，自从人类分化成为阶级以后，就没有过这种统一的爱。过去的一切统治阶级喜欢提倡这个东西，许多所谓圣人贤人也喜欢提倡这个东西，但是无论谁都没有真正实行过，因为它在阶级社会里是不可能实行的。”用毛主席的话照一照那些牛鬼蛇神的嘴脸，就可以看出他们所鼓吹的“仁政”“德治”，就是要混淆阶级界限，调和阶级矛盾。他们的滥调不过是赫鲁晓夫修正主义“全民党”“全民国家”的翻版。
    在这次会上，牛鬼蛇神们明目张胆地攻击无产阶级专政“不仁”，胡说无产阶级专政“已有意无意间侵犯了他人的生存”。这些资产阶级右派梦想以“仁”来瓦解我们的无产阶级专政，是绝对办不到的。这是“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”。我们对于阶级敌人决不能施“仁政”，就是只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动，如要乱说乱动，立即取缔，予以制裁。
    大肆攻击党的总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗，是参加“孔子讨论会”的牛鬼蛇神的又一罪状。他们和党内右倾机会主义者穿一条裤子，为右倾机会主义分子鼓气、翻案。他们骂我们党“自高自大”，“不懂装懂，强不知以为知”，攻击我们党“茫乱无知就胡乱发号施令”，是“乱讲蛮干”。他们恶毒地诅咒我们“招来更大的错误，遭到更大的恶果”，是“不可以长久下去的”。他们咬牙切齿恨不得我们“倾败其室”，“泣血涟如”。然而他们这种叫嚣不过是恶犬吠日，无济于事。我国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗指引下获得的伟大成绩是谁也否定不了的。在伟大的三面红旗面前，全国人民齐声欢呼，一切反动派只能向隅而泣。
    这些牛鬼蛇神在社会主义的新中国，演出这幕“尊孔”丑剧并不奇怪。历史告诉我们，中国二千多年来，反动的剥削阶级总是利用孔子的思想来为他们服务。他们掌权的时候，就用孔子的思想来欺骗和愚弄劳动人民，以巩固他们的统治。在他们被推翻以后，又要抬出孔子这具封建僵尸，企图借助它在社会上的影响，为反革命复辟制造舆论准备。远的不说，窃国大盗袁世凯复辟做皇帝时，就掀起过一股“复古尊孔”的逆流。反动军阀张勋在拥清朝皇帝复辟之前，也肉麻地吹捧孔子。人民公敌蒋介石，为镇压革命运动，巩固其反动统治，更是把孔子奉为他的“祖师爷”。直到一九六○年，蒋介石还亲自出场，在台湾演出成立“孔孟学会”的丑剧，叫嚣这是对中国人民进行“全面的思想战，文化战，主义战”，“其意义非常重大”。这一切都说明，孔子思想，孔老二这具僵尸究竟对谁有利，为谁所欢迎；也说明一切形式的“复古尊孔”究竟是什么反动货色。
    今天，无产阶级文化大革命正以雷霆万钧之势横扫一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。在这场伟大的革命运动中，我们要更高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，对一切毒草进行无情的批判。我们要打倒孔子思想，打倒孔老二这具封建僵尸，彻底批判形形色色的“复古尊孔”，粉碎一小撮反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级反动“权威”的反革命复辟企图。我们要大立毛泽东思想。谁胆敢反对毛泽东思想，不管他是人是鬼，不管他地位多高，资格多老，我们都坚决和他斗争，打倒他，叫他永世不得翻身。让毛泽东思想的阳光永远照耀着我们前进！
