The Revolutionary Line of Chairman Mao Achieves Great Victory

Completely Smashing the Counter-Revolutionary Plot of the Class Enemy to Restore Capitalism

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana on the 19th, the Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published an editorial on the 18th, condemning the attacks by imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries on China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The article said, the People's Republic of China is developing vigorously and comprehensively, especially the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong is proceeding victoriously. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong has defeated the bourgeois reactionary line. This has caused great alarm to the "holy alliance" of all reactionary forces in the world, including imperialism, revisionism, and the Vatican.

The article pointed out that the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong is giving a decisive blow to the revisionist elements and the bourgeois reactionary line in China, and is smashing all their plots. The article pointed out that the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong and the deep and broad development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have shattered the dreams of imperialism and modern revisionism to achieve "peaceful evolution" and the restoration of capitalism in China. Due to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great Chinese people mastering Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Republic of China will become even stronger in all aspects of economy, politics, and military. The imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists see that their plan to attack the fortress from within has failed. Therefore, on the one hand, they are conducting various kinds of frenzied attacks on China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; on the other hand, they are tightening their collusion to isolate and encircle China. The article pointed out that at a time when imperialism and modern revisionism are in difficulty, the Pope comes out to intensify counter-revolutionary activities. People of the world and all true revolutionaries must expose the plots of imperialists and modern revisionists, expose the Pope's reactionary policies of using religion to deceive the people under the guise of religion, and ensure that their sinister goal of opposing the freedom and progress of the people of all countries will never succeed.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana on the 19th, the Albanian "Unity" newspaper published an editorial on the 18th, pointing out that the great victory of Shanghai revolutionary workers in smashing the sabotage activities of a small handful of revisionist elements and bourgeois conspirators is a heavy blow to the common enemy of the people of Albania and China and all revolutionary people in the world—imperialism and modern revisionism.

The article said, the Albanian working people, in many letters to the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 32 other revolutionary mass organizations, once again expressed their deep feelings and boundless love for the 700 million great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China, and the great leader of the Chinese people, the dear and most respected friend of the Albanian people, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong. The Albanian working people wholeheartedly hail the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is being carried out under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong.

The article said, just as the people of Albania and all revolutionary people in the world are rejoicing over the victory of Shanghai revolutionary workers, imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, as well as all kinds of reactionaries, are cursing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and opposing the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong in the same tone. This once again forcefully proves that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is proceeding along the correct path. The imperialists and modern revisionists curse the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution endlessly because this revolution has made their dream of seeing revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China burst like a soap bubble, because this revolution is accelerating their doom and the victory of the world revolution.

The article emphasized that the complete and thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat in China and make the iron defender of the revolutionary people of the world—the People's Republic of China—even stronger. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has enriched the revolutionary experience of the international communist movement and pointed the way forward for all Marxist-Leninists in the world.

The article concluded by saying that the Albanian people will follow the teachings of the Party of Labor of Albania and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and together with the 700 million great Chinese people, forever hold high the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, and march forward along the revolutionary path.

The picture shows, in the Chinese pavilion at the Algiers International Expo, Algerian workers, peasants, and students are listening attentively as a guide explains the revolutionary actions of the Red Guards in breaking the old and establishing the new. They sing praises: "The Red Guards are the vanguard of the revolution."

### 阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》和《团结报》发表编辑部文章  毛主席的革命路线取得了伟大的胜利  彻底粉碎阶级敌人复辟资本主义阴谋

    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》和《团结报》发表编辑部文章
    毛主席的革命路线取得了伟大的胜利
    彻底粉碎阶级敌人复辟资本主义阴谋
    据新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十八日发表编辑部文章，谴责帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    文章说，中华人民共和国正在蓬勃和全面地发展，特别是在毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利进行，以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线战胜了资产阶级反动路线。这引起了帝国主义、修正主义和包括梵蒂冈在内的世界所有反动力量的“神圣同盟”的严重不安。
    文章指出，以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线正给予中国的修正主义分子和资产阶级反动路线以决定性打击，并且正在粉碎他们的一切阴谋活动。文章指出，以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，无产阶级文化大革命深入和广阔的发展，使帝国主义和现代修正主义在中国搞“和平演变”和资本主义复辟的梦想破灭了。由于无产阶级文化大革命和伟大的中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，中华人民共和国将在经济、政治和军事各个方面变得更加强大。帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者看到，他们企图从内部攻破堡垒的计划破产了。因此，他们一方面对中国的无产阶级文化大革命进行各种各样的疯狂攻击；一方面加紧勾结，以便孤立中国，包围中国。文章指出，在帝国主义和现代修正主义正处于困难的境地的时候，罗马教皇出来加紧进行反革命活动。全世界人民和一切真正的革命者必须揭露帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的阴谋，揭露罗马教皇披着宗教外衣，竭力利用人民对宗教的信仰，欺骗人民的反动政策，使他们反对各国人民自由和进步的阴险目的永远不能得逞。
    新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十八日发表编辑部文章指出，上海革命工人粉碎了一小撮修正主义分子和资产阶级阴谋分子的破坏活动的伟大胜利，是对阿中两国人民和世界一切革命人民共同敌人——帝国主义和现代修正主义的沉重打击。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民在给上海工人革命造反总司令部等三十二个革命群众组织的许多信件中，再次表达了对七亿伟大中国人民、中国共产党和中国人民的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的和最尊贵的朋友、杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的深厚感情和无限的热爱。阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民衷心地欢呼由毛泽东同志直接领导的正在胜利开展的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    文章说，正当阿尔巴尼亚人民和世界一切革命人民为上海革命工人的胜利而感到欢欣鼓舞的时候，以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义以及一切形形色色的反动分子却以同一个调子，在咒骂中国的无产阶级文化大革命，反对中国共产党和毛泽东同志。这恰恰再一次有力地证明，中国的无产阶级文化大革命正沿着正确的道路前进。帝国主义者和现代修正主义者无休止地咒骂无产阶级文化大革命，是因为这场革命使他们妄想在中国出现修正主义和复辟资本主义的美梦像肥皂泡一样破灭了，是因为这场革命加速了他们的灭亡，加速了世界革命的胜利。
    文章强调指出，无产阶级文化大革命完全和彻底的胜利必将加强中国的无产阶级专政，必将使世界革命人民的钢铁般的保卫者——中华人民共和国更加强大。中国无产阶级文化大革命丰富了国际共产主义运动的革命经验，向全世界一切马克思列宁主义者指出了正确道路。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民决心遵循阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志的教导，同七亿伟大的中国人民一起，永远高举战无不胜的马克思列宁主义旗帜，沿着革命大道向前迈进。
