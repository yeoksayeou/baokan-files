The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sweeping across the country with the momentum of a surging tide and the force of thunder, shaking the world. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, have risen up in rebellion. We are rebelling against a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and against the capitalist reactionary line. The momentum of our rebellion is swift and irresistible!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the U.S. imperialists' aggressive forces in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord." A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, in order to divert the direction of the struggle and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, once stirred up a counter-revolutionary wind of economism in our commune. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, firmly resisted this counter-revolutionary wind and engaged in face-to-face struggles with those scoundrels. However, they did not give up. They played new tricks, using the tactic of "luring the tiger away from the mountain" to incite a large number of rural commune members and sent-down educated youth to leave their production posts and rush to the cities, seriously affecting the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in this region and also affecting agricultural production. The revolutionary rebels of the poor and lower-middle peasants in our commune promptly exposed their plots and issued an urgent appeal to all production brigades and teams, urging everyone not to be deceived by them and not to be misled. We also organized everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's works on opposing economism and carried out extensive propaganda activities. Many commune members and sent-down educated youth who had been deceived and left their production posts have now returned to their production posts, devoted themselves to agricultural production, and actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside, determined to carry the revolution through to the end!

In the living class struggle, we deeply realize that revolutionary peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. We have repeatedly repelled the new counter-attacks of the capitalist reactionary line and won one victory after another.

The Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters and the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Peasants' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, along with twenty-seven other revolutionary rebel organizations, issued the "Open Letter to All the People of Shanghai," which expressed our sentiments and gave us great encouragement. We studied and discussed this important document in conjunction with the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our commune. During the study, everyone expressed their determination to further raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out the spirit of this document, and the four points proposed in it, thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism, seize the revolution, and promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside through to the end!

　　革命农民造反之势锐不可挡
　　川沙县严桥公社贫下中农革命造反司令部
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”
    无产阶级文化大革命正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全国，震撼着世界。在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，我们广大贫下中农起来造反了，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造地富反坏右的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反。造反之势，迅猛异常，锐不可挡！
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为了转移斗争大方向，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，在我们公社里，也曾刮起了一股反革命经济主义的妖风。我们广大贫下中农坚决顶住了这股妖风，同那些混蛋展开了面对面的斗争。但是，他们并没有死心，又玩弄了新的手法，使用“调虎离山”计，煽动农村大批社员和落户知识青年离开生产岗位，涌向城市，严重地影响了本地区的无产阶级文化大革命的开展，也影响了农业生产。我们公社贫下中农革命造反派及时识破了他们的阴谋，向各大队、各生产队发出了紧急呼吁，要大家不要上这些家伙的当，不要受他们蒙蔽，并且组织大家反复地学习了毛主席有关反对经济主义的著作，开展了广泛的宣传活动。许多受了蒙蔽离开生产岗位的社员、落户知识青年，现在已纷纷回到生产岗位，安心农业生产，积极投入了农村的无产阶级文化大革命运动，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    在活生生的阶级斗争中，我们深深认识到，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命农民，是攻无不克，战无不胜的。我们一次又一次打退了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，夺得一个又一个的新胜利。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部和上海农民革命造反总司令部筹备委员会等二十七个革命造反组织发表的《告上海全市人民书》，说出了我们的心里话，给了我们极大的鼓舞，我们结合本公社无产阶级文化大革命运动的情况，学习和讨论了这个重要文件。在学习中，大家都表示要进一步高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行这个文件的精神，以及文件中提出的四条意见，彻底摧毁反革命经济主义，抓革命，促生产，将农村无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
