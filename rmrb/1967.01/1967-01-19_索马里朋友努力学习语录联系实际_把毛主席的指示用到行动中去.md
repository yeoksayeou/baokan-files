The brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong shine like the sun, illuminating the hearts of the Somali people. More and more people are studying the works of Chairman Mao.

Recently, an employee from a government agency visited the reception room of the Chinese Embassy to request copies of Chairman Mao's works. At that time, since all the copies of Chairman Mao's works originally held by the embassy had been taken by Somali friends, his request could not be fulfilled. When he looked up and saw a quotation from Chairman Mao hanging on the wall, he immediately paid close attention and began to read it. He then took out his notebook to copy it: "The atomic bomb is a paper tiger used by the American reactionaries to scare people. It looks terrible but in reality it is not. Of course, the atomic bomb is a weapon of mass slaughter, but what decides the outcome of a war is the people, not a few new weapons."

He read and wrote, and after finishing, he asked a Chinese friend to explain the historical background of Chairman Mao's remarks. After listening, he happily said, "Chairman Mao's words are spot on. The American imperialists have used many new weapons in the Vietnam battlefield, but the Vietnamese people are fighting stronger and stronger, while the American imperialists are trapped in the encirclement of the Vietnamese people. This proves that what decides the outcome of a war is the people, not the weapons."

The young intellectual Ibrahim has been persistently studying Chairman Mao's works for over half a year. Later, he obtained a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and his studies became even more diligent. He also expressed his determination to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

As early as half a year ago, Ibrahim had read Chairman Mao's essay "The Direction of the Youth Movement." He was greatly inspired by Chairman Mao's words: "How do we judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to and actually does unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants."

Last October, after the commencement of the construction of the theater aided by China for Somalia, Ibrahim frequently went to the construction site to work alongside workers from both China and Somalia. Although the tropical sun scorched him, making him sweat profusely and blister his hands, his enthusiasm for labor remained undiminished. He told his Chinese friends, "Chairman Mao teaches us to combine theory with practice. We must apply his instructions to our actual actions."

    索马里朋友努力学习语录联系实际
    把毛主席的指示用到行动中去
    据新华社摩加迪沙电　闪耀着灿烂光辉的毛泽东思想，像太阳一样照亮了索马里人民的心。越来越多的人在学习毛主席著作。
    不久前，一位政府机关的职员到中国大使馆的接待室索取毛主席著作。当时，由于大使馆原有的毛主席著作被索马里朋友们要光了，他的要求没有得到满足。当他抬头看到挂在墙上的一幅毛主席语录时，立即注意地读起来，并且拿出笔记本来抄写：“原子弹是美国反动派用来吓人的一只纸老虎，看样子可怕，实际上并不可怕。当然，原子弹是一种大规模屠杀的武器，但是决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”
    他边念边写，抄完后，又请中国朋友介绍了毛主席发表这段谈话的时代背景。他听了后高兴地说：“毛主席的这段话，对极了。美帝国主义在越南战场上使用了许多新式武器，但是越南人民却越战越强，而美帝国主义则陷在越南人民的包围之中。这就可以证明，决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是武器。”
    知识青年伊卜拉欣坚持学习毛主席著作已经半年多了，后来，他得到一本《毛主席语录》，学习得更加勤奋，并且表示一定要按照毛主席的指示办事。
    早在半年前，伊卜拉欣就读过毛主席所写的《青年运动的方向》。他对毛主席说的“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”这一段话给了他很大的启发。
    去年十月，中国援助索马里建设的剧场开工后，伊卜拉欣就经常到工地和中索两国的工人们一起劳动。虽然热带的太阳烤得人汗流浃背，手上也打起了泡，但他的劳动热情始终饱满。他对中国朋友说：“毛主席教导我们要理论联系实际。我们一定要把他的指示运用到实际行动中去。”
