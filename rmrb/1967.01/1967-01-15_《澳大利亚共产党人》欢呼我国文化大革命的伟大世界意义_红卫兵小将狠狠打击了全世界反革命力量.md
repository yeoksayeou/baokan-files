	The Australian Communist Welcomes the Great Global Significance of Our Country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

	Red Guards Have Dealt a Heavy Blow to the Counter-Revolutionary Forces Around the World

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne: The theoretical journal of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists), _The Australian Communist_, recently published an article welcoming the great global significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and praising the revolutionary enthusiasm of the Red Guards and their great achievements in this revolution.

	The article states: "The Cultural Revolution in China has already shown how important it is to carry out class struggle in a socialist country." The article points out that all socialist countries face the problem of how to ensure the victory of the socialist cause and prevent capitalist restoration in the face of class enemies both domestically and internationally. The article says: "There is only one answer to this question. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China has provided this answer. This is to eliminate reactionaries, no matter where they are, no matter what position they hold, and to smash their plots to restore capitalist methods."

	The article praises the Red Guards for their great contributions in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The article points out that the actions of the Red Guards "have not only dealt a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary forces in China, but also to the counter-revolutionary forces around the world," and "have dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists and the revisionist forces."

	The article also points out that it is not surprising that the class enemies are shouting loudly about China's Cultural Revolution and the activities of the Red Guards, "because they can clearly see that these two great developments have destroyed the foundations they hoped to rely on in their efforts to subvert and ultimately overthrow China's socialist system."

	The article condemns the Soviet revisionists for colluding with imperialism to madly attack and slander the Chinese Cultural Revolution, pointing out: "On these issues, they have formed what can only be called a united front with the bourgeoisie in their efforts to slander a great revolutionary movement."

	The article states that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and guided by the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong, are consolidating their socialist revolution. They will ensure that China steadfastly moves forward to realize communism.

    世界革命人民热烈赞扬中国红卫兵的革命行动
    《澳大利亚共产党人》欢呼我国文化大革命的伟大世界意义
    红卫兵小将狠狠打击了全世界反革命力量
    据新华社讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）的理论刊物《澳大利亚共产党人》最近发表文章，欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大世界意义，赞扬红卫兵小将们的革命热情和他们在这场革命中所建立的巨大功勋。
    文章说：“中国的文化大革命已经使人看清了，在一个社会主义国家里进行阶级斗争是多么重要”。文章指出，社会主义国家都面临着如何在国内外存在着阶级敌人的情况下保证社会主义事业胜利和防止资本主义复辟的问题。文章说：对于这个问题，只能有一个答案，“在毛泽东的英明领导下的中国共产党已经提供了这个答案。这就是清除反动分子，不管他们在什么地方，不管他们居于什么地位，摧毁他们恢复资本主义方式的阴谋”。
    文章赞扬红卫兵对在这场无产阶级文化大革命中作出了巨大的贡献。文章指出，红卫兵的行动“不仅在中国，而且在全世界对反革命力量进行了巨大的打击”，“对美帝国主义和修正主义势力进行了巨大的打击”。
    文章还指出，阶级敌人就中国的文化大革命和红卫兵的活动大叫大嚷是不足为怪的，“因为他们可以非常清楚地看到，这两个伟大的事态发展破坏了他们在颠覆和最后推翻中国的社会主义制度的努力中所希望依靠的基础。”
    文章谴责苏联修正主义者同帝国主义勾结一起，疯狂攻击和诋毁中国文化大革命，指出：“在这些问题上，他们在资产阶级为诋毁一个伟大革命运动而作的努力中与资产阶级结成了只能称为是联合阵线的东西。”
    文章说，中国人民，在中国共产党的领导下，在光辉的毛泽东思想指导下，正在巩固他们的社会主义革命。他们将保证中国坚定不移地前进，以实现共产主义。
