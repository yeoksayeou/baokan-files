Revolutionary rebels must unite, first and foremost, on the basis of a shared direction! Our shared direction is to concentrate our efforts on striking down the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. In the revolutionary struggle, we must firmly grasp this shared direction and never waver or be ambiguous about it.

Revolutionary rebels must also unite and wage an uncompromising struggle against the various erroneous thoughts that have infiltrated our ranks. To correct these erroneous thoughts, we must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and continuously carry out rectification within the ranks of the revolutionary rebels, daring to touch upon the soul. As Chairman Mao teaches, we must "correct individualism from the ideological standpoint." Ultimately, this means breaking away from the "private" self and advocating for the "public" good. The "private" self is the core of bourgeois ideology. In his essay "On Correcting Erroneous Thoughts Within the Party," Chairman Mao criticized eight erroneous thoughts, all of which stem from the "private" self. When the "private" self takes precedence, one dare not uphold the truth and may retreat in the face of severe tests. The "private" self is like a frog in a well, with a narrow vision that only sees immediate and personal interests, losing sight of the grand revolutionary cause. In short, the "private" self is the most dangerous enemy within the revolutionary ranks, an obstacle to the great unity of the revolutionary rebels. To achieve this great unity, we must bravely burn away the "private" self and ruthlessly kick away this stumbling block.

Only by eliminating the "private" self can we establish the "public" good. With the "public" good, we can uphold the truth, dare to "suffer a thousand cuts to pull the emperor from his horse," dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire; we can promote the great unity of revolutionary rebel organizations. Clinging to sectarianism and forming small cliques is the work of the "private" self, which has a corrosive and centrifugal effect on the revolutionary ranks. We do not want privileges! We do not want to show off! We do not want fame! We do not want positions! We reject the entire package of revisionism! Only in this way can we thoroughly uproot the source of revisionism and firmly plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought! Only in this way can we achieve the great unity of the revolutionary rebels, avoid getting bogged down in minor issues, and always unite on the basis of a shared direction. Only in this way can our united revolutionary rebel army expose the enemy's tricks and schemes, and see through the enemy's various ploys. With such a revolutionary army, the enemy's schemes of "infiltrating and pulling out" will be thoroughly foiled!

Comrades of the revolutionary rebels, let us build an impregnable wall of copper and iron, unite and stand together under the radiant sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought!

　　“私”字是阻碍革命大联合的绊脚石
　　红枪手
    革命造反派要大联合，首先是在大方向一致的前提下联合起来！我们的大方向是集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，在革命斗争中，要牢牢把握住这个大方向，决不能有任何含糊，有任何动摇。
    革命造反派要联合起来，还必须同反映到我们内部来的形形色色的错误思想作不调和的斗争。要纠正错误思想，我们就要认真活学活用毛主席著作，就得在革命造反派内部不断进行整风，要敢于触及灵魂。正如毛主席教导的，要“从思想上纠正个人主义”。归根结底，也就是要破除一个“私”字，大力提倡一个“公”字。“私”字，是资产阶级的核心思想。毛主席在《关于纠正党内的错误思想》一文中批判的八种错误思想，其根源还是在一个“私”字。“私”字当头，就不敢坚持真理，在严峻考验的关键时刻，会退下阵来。“私”字当头，犹如井底之蛙，鼠目寸光，只看到眼前、个人的利益，失去远大的革命志向。总之，“私”字，是革命队伍中最危险的敌人，是阻碍革命造反派大联合的绊脚石。革命造反派要大联合，必须勇敢地焚烧掉这个“私”字，毫不留情地踢开这块绊脚石。
    只有破私，才能立公。有了这个“公”字，就能坚持真理，就能“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”，刀山敢上，火海敢闯；就能促进革命造反派组织的大联合。闹宗派，搞小团体，这是“私”字作怪，对革命队伍有很大销蚀、离心作用。特权，我们不要！出风头，我们不要！名誉，我们不要！地位，我们也不要！修正主义的一套，我们统统不要！只有这样，才能彻底挖掉修正主义的根子，扎牢毛泽东思想的根子！只有这样，才能使革命造反派大联合，不纠缠在某些枝节问题上，才能始终坚持在大方向一致的前提下联合起来。只有这样，我们联合组成的革命造反大军才能揭露敌人玩弄的阴谋诡计，戳穿敌人的种种花招。有了这样一支革命大军，敌人玩弄的“打进来，拉出去”的阴谋勾当就彻底破产了！
    革命造反派的同志们，让我们砌成一堵坚不可摧的铜墙铁壁，在毛泽东思想阳光的光辉照耀下联合起来，团结起来！
