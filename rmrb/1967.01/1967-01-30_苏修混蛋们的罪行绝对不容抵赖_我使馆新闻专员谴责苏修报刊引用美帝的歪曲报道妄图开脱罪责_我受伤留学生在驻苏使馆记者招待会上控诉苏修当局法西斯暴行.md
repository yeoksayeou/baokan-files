The crimes of the Soviet revisionists are absolutely indefensible.
Our embassy's press officer condemns Soviet revisionist publications for quoting American imperialist distortions in an attempt to evade responsibility.
Our injured students denounce the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist authorities at a press conference held at our embassy in the Soviet Union.

	NEW DELHI, January 28 (Xinhua) - The press officer of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Miao Qun, held a press conference here today, strongly condemning and denouncing the brutal crime committed by the Soviet revisionist authorities on January 25 in the Red Square against our revolutionary students.

	More than a hundred journalists and press officers from various countries stationed in Moscow attended the press conference.

	Miao Qun angrily pointed out at the press conference that in recent days, Soviet publications have grossly distorted the truth about the Red Square bloodshed, claiming that the Soviet military police and plainclothes agents' brutal actions against our students in Europe were "protecting" them. Is this not the same despicable trick and logic of bandits as that of the American imperialist murderers?

	Miao Qun then exposed that the Soviet "Pravda" newspaper on January 27 quoted the malicious report of the American United Press in an attempt to exonerate the Soviet revisionist ruling clique for the heinous crimes they committed in the Red Square. He said, this is a futile attempt, a pipe dream, which only proves once again their treacherous behavior of Soviet-American collaboration. Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We must expose the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying Lenin's cause.

	Miao Qun then read out the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 26 and the telegram of condolence sent by Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Chen Yi on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to our students in Europe.

	Our injured student Jin Xianxiao, representing the 69 students who were brutally beaten by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents, denounced at the press conference the heinous crimes committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership in suppressing Chinese revolutionary students. He said, when we were reading Chairman Mao's quotations and singing "The Internationale," Soviet military police and plainclothes agents suddenly attacked us. They punched and kicked us, pushing female students down the steps. Some agents grabbed two female students by the hair and banged their heads together. Some three or four thugs ganged up on a single student. Many of our comrades were beaten until their faces were covered in blood. More than ten people had their glasses broken, some had their eyes beaten and bleeding, and some were beaten to the ground and then kicked by the agents.

	Jin Xianxiao continued, the Soviet revisionists do not allow us to read Chairman Mao's quotations, do not allow us to sing "The Internationale," but we will read and sing. Because Chairman Mao teaches us, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." Jin Xianxiao angrily denounced the Soviet agents for snatching and trampling on the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He said, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is our sacred book, and we will not allow the Soviet agents to desecrate it. We will defend its dignity with our lives. We snatched back the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from the agents.

	Another injured student, Ma Wenpu, also denounced the fascist atrocities of the Soviet authorities with great indignation. Pointing to his swollen nose, he angrily said, "Look at how brutal the Soviet revisionist leadership is to our Chinese students!" He then took out his blood-stained coat and scarf and said, "Look, this is the ironclad evidence of the Soviet fascist crimes!" Ma Wenpu said, "I will denounce and firmly protest to the world the savage suppression by the Soviet government. Their atrocities prove that they have betrayed Lenin's cause! No matter how they beat us, we still finished reading Chairman Mao's quotations and singing 'The Internationale.'"

	Ma Wenpu emphasized that Chinese students armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid of violence. He said, "The Soviet revisionists beat us, which does not show their strength, but rather shows their weakness. The truth is on our side. We want to tell Brezhnev and Kosygin, you owe this blood debt, and it must be repaid!" He then raised his arm and shouted, "Down with modern revisionism! Down with Brezhnev! Down with Kosygin! Smash the heads of Brezhnev and Kosygin! Long live Leninism! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao!"

	Dr. Wang Weijun, the chief physician of the Neurosurgery Department of the "Anti-Imperialist Hospital" in our capital, who arrived in Moscow from Beijing in the early hours of January 27, also spoke at the press conference. He said, "We are medical workers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. We strongly protest against the cruel persecution of our students by the Soviet modern revisionists; we express our greatest concern and firm support for our class brothers."

	Wang Weijun then described the situation of the nine Chinese students who were seriously injured and had to stay in Moscow for treatment. He said that the methods used by the Soviet revisionist authorities to suppress the students were extremely vicious, and the beatings were extremely brutal. The injured parts were mostly vital areas such as the head, chest, and abdomen.

	Wang Weijun pointed out that one of the nine injured students in Moscow, Huang Jian, had injuries on his chest, back, and abdomen, and had fractures. He is still in danger, has difficulty breathing, has severe chest pain, and cannot lie flat. Chen Luki and three other comrades were punched and kicked until they fainted, with blood flowing from their mouths and noses, causing concussions. They are still unable to get out of bed, have headaches and dizziness, and cannot take care of themselves. In addition to the two injured students who spoke earlier, the other three injured students were injured in multiple places such as the head, chest, and abdomen. Some of the wounds have become infected and suppurated, and the body temperature has risen.

	Wang Weijun was very excited at the press conference and said, "Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China are particularly concerned about our injured students and have decided to send a special plane to bring our revolutionary students back to Beijing for treatment as soon as possible."

	The press officer of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, who presided over the press conference, answered the questions raised by the journalists.

	The press conference also exhibited photographs of the bloody suppression of our revolutionary students by the Soviet revisionist leadership on January 25. (See attached pictures)

    苏修混蛋们的罪行绝对不容抵赖
　　我使馆新闻专员谴责苏修报刊引用美帝的歪曲报道妄图开脱罪责
　　我受伤留学生在驻苏使馆记者招待会上控诉苏修当局法西斯暴行
    新华社莫斯科二十八日电　中国驻苏联大使馆新闻专员缪群二十八日在这里举行记者招待会，强烈谴责和控诉苏联修正主义当局二十五日在红场残酷镇压我国革命学生的血腥罪行。
    许多国家驻莫斯科记者和使馆新闻官员百余人出席了记者招待会。
    缪群在记者招待会上愤怒地指出，最近几天，苏联报刊大肆歪曲红场流血事件的真相，竟把苏联军警和便衣特务镇压我国留欧学生的罪恶行动，说成是对我国学生的“保护”，这种卑鄙的伎俩和强盗逻辑难道不是和美帝国主义杀人犯一模一样吗？！
    缪群接着揭露苏联《消息报》二十七日引用美国合众国际社的恶意报道妄图为苏修统治集团在红场上犯下的滔天罪行开脱。他说，这是痴心妄想，白日做梦，这只能又一次证明他们的苏美合作的叛卖行为。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们一定要揭露苏修领导集团背叛列宁事业的罪恶行动。
    缪群接着宣读了我国外交部二十六日的声明和周恩来同志和陈毅同志代表伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志、代表党中央和国务院致我国留欧学生的慰问电。
    我国受伤学生金先孝代表六十九名遭到苏联军警和便衣特务毒打的同学，在记者招待会上控诉了苏修领导集团镇压中国革命学生的滔天罪行。他说，苏联军警和便衣特务在我们读毛主席语录和唱《国际歌》时，突然袭击我们。他们拳打脚踢，把女同学从石阶上推下来。有的特务抓住两个女同学的头发互相撞碰她们的头。有的三、四个打手围攻一个学生。许多同学被打得血流满面，有十几个人眼镜被打破，有的眼睛被打伤流血，有的被打倒在地还遭到特务们的踩踢。
    金先孝接着说，苏联修正主义者不许我们读毛主席语录，不许我们唱《国际歌》，但是，我们就是要读，就是要唱。因为毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”金先孝愤怒谴责苏修特务们从中国学生手中抢夺和践踏《毛主席语录》。他说，《毛主席语录》是我们的宝书，决不允许苏修特务们损害它，我们要用生命保卫它的尊严。我们从特务手中夺回了《毛主席语录》。
    另一名受伤学生马文普也以极其激愤的心情控诉了苏修当局的法西斯暴行。他指着自己被打肿了的鼻梁愤怒地说：“请大家看看苏修领导集团对我们中国学生是多么凶狠！”他随后又拿出自己的血迹斑斑的大衣和围巾说：“请看吧，这就是苏修法西斯罪行的铁证！”马文普说：“我要向全世界控诉并坚决抗议苏联政府对我们这种残暴的镇压，他们这种暴行证明他们背叛了列宁的事业！不管他们怎样毒打我们，我们还是朗读完了毛主席语录，唱完了《国际歌》。”
    马文普强调指出，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国学生是不怕暴力的。他说：“苏联修正主义者毒打我们，并不说明他们强大，相反，正说明他们是虚弱的。真理在我们这一边。我们要告诉勃列日涅夫和柯西金，你们欠下的这笔血债是一定要偿还的！”
    最后他振臂高呼：“打倒现代修正主义！”“打倒勃列日涅夫！”“打倒柯西金！”“砸烂勃列日涅夫、柯西金的狗头！”“列宁主义万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    在二十七日深夜由北京专程赶到莫斯科的我国首都“反帝医院”神经外科主治医生王维钧同志也在记者招待会上发表了谈话。他说：“我们是毛泽东思想哺育起来的医务工作者。对苏联现代修正主义者如此残酷迫害我们的学生，我们表示坚决抗议；对我们自己的阶级兄弟，我们表示最大的关怀和坚决的支持。”
    王维钧接着叙述了他和他的同事们对由于伤势严重而留在莫斯科就医的九名中国学生进行检查和会诊的情况。他说，苏修当局镇压学生的手段是十分毒辣的，毒打的方式是十分凶狠的。被打伤的部位大多是致命的地方，如头部、胸部、腹部等。
    王维钧指出，现在莫斯科的九名伤员之一黄建同的胸部、背部、腹部几处受伤，并被打成骨折，现在仍未脱离险境，呼吸仍有困难，胸部有剧痛，不能平卧。陈履奎等三位同志受到了拳打脚踢，直被打到昏迷不醒，口鼻流血，造成脑震荡。他们现在仍然不能起床，头痛头昏，生活不能自理。除刚才讲话的两名受伤学生外，其他三个受伤者都是头部、胸部、腹部等多处受伤。有的伤口已感染化脓，体温增高。
    王维钧十分激动地在记者招待会上说：“毛主席和中共中央特别关怀我国受伤的同学，要我们千方百计地给他们治疗，并且已经决定立即派专机来接我们的革命学生回北京医治。”
    主持这次记者招待会的我国驻苏联大使馆新闻专员回答了记者们提出的问题。
    记者招待会上还展出了二十五日苏修领导集团血腥镇压我国革命学生的照片。（附图片）
