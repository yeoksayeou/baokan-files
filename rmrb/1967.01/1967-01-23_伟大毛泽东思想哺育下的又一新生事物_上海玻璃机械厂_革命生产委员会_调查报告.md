Great Mao Zedong Thought is nurturing the growth of new things.

We now introduce the "Revolutionary Production Committee" created by Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory during the Cultural Revolution, which is a budding new organizational form of communism and a great innovative achievement of the times.

Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory is a medium-sized factory with over 1,200 workers. Before the Cultural Revolution, it was a public-private joint venture.

Before liberation, the owner, Wang Yimin, ruthlessly exploited the workers. The owner's henchmen and feudal gangs were like poisonous snakes, tightly coiled around the workers, sucking their blood and sweat.

After liberation, these elements used the tactic of "pulling out and pushing in," corrupting party cadres sent to the factory on the one hand, and disguising themselves to infiltrate the party on the other. These exploiters and degenerate elements colluded with each other, recruited followers, formed cliques, and placed their cronies and protégés in key positions, tightly controlling the entire factory. It was truly an independent kingdom, impervious to water and needles.

Economically, they did as they pleased: "Eating and taking more is not a big deal, promotions and rewards are decided with a single word." In 1963, during the evaluation, cadres were promoted by two levels, while workers generally only got half or a third of a level. In short, in the factory, as long as you served these people loyally, you could be recruited into the party, be named a "Five Good Worker," and receive special treatment for promotions and rewards. If anyone dared to touch their tiger's ass, they would scheme to retaliate and impose bourgeois dictatorship. For a long time, these capitalists in power were rampant and unruly, committing countless crimes against the country and the people. The broad masses of workers were all indignant and full of rage.

This power must be seized!

A thunderclap from the ground, the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ignited by our most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao swept across the country, tolling the death knell for all those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road and all the ghosts and monsters.

However, the enemy is not willing to meet their doom. They fight desperately like cornered beasts. Planned by a handful of those in power within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road, a wind of economism blew. This was exactly what the capitalists in power within Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory wanted. These elements incited a large number of workers in the Red Guards to leave their production posts and attack the proletarian headquarters.

For a time, production was seriously affected. For example, in the foundry workshop, 35 out of 140 people left; more than 30 molders were reduced to a dozen; half of the eight production team leaders left; only one out of four technicians remained. While the three leaders in the workshop, two actively supported the Red Guards going out, spending the whole day sending steamed buns to the Red Guards, completely ignoring production, causing serious idling and stoppages.

Seeing the serious losses to socialist construction and the blatant sabotage of the Cultural Revolution by the class enemies, the comrades in the worker rebel faction were all indignant and furious. The long-suppressed hatred towards those in power taking the capitalist road erupted like a volcano! This power must be seized!

A Sharp Struggle

Let those bosses step aside!

We workers must liberate ourselves and manage ourselves.

On a memorable day, December 27, 1966, Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory posted the first big-character poster demanding power seizure. The poster demanded the establishment of a "Worker Production Management Committee" (i.e., the "Revolutionary Production Committee") to replace the original leadership, to seize the revolution, and to promote production! This poster expressed the wishes of the broad masses of worker rebels and revolutionary workers, and immediately over a hundred people signed their names on the poster.

From then on, the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory entered a new high tide. The establishment of the "Revolutionary Production Committee" and the tide of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" surged through the entire factory.

The "Revolutionary Production Committee" is the practice of proletarian democracy, following the principle of universal suffrage of the Paris Commune, fully discussed by the masses, and elected through secret ballots. Thus, the committee members are not appointed by superiors but are the most satisfactory and trusted people elected by the masses. The members of the "Revolutionary Production Committee" are not only politically active but also production experts.

The members of the "Revolutionary Production Committee" are all called service personnel, completely abolishing past titles like "chief." The service personnel are responsible for various tasks in the factory, divided into political service personnel, production service personnel, trade union service personnel, etc. In the "Revolutionary Production Committee," anyone who is unfit can be dismissed or replaced by the masses at any time. Thus, proletarian democracy is fully and effectively practiced and guaranteed.

The "Revolutionary Production Committee" is a new thing that must break with the old thoroughly. Therefore, in the process of its establishment, it fought resolutely against various right-opportunist and weak and incompetent thoughts:

On December 27, after 200-plus Red Guards stopped working, a big-character poster was posted in the factory demanding the establishment of the "Revolutionary Production Committee," which caused a great stir and immediately sparked a struggle within the core forces.

Some people said: The original team is "door gods," and they can be used to manage technology.

But someone firmly opposed it, arguing: To make a revolution is to be thorough, not to compromise. Rebellion is to blaze a new trail, not to follow an old one. The original team is not worth believing in.

The masses can best discern the truth, so the entire factory was mobilized for discussion. A fierce debate ensued. Eighty percent of the masses unanimously demanded that the four original section chiefs step down and go to the workshops to work.

Is it "seizing the revolution and promoting production," or is it a purely production-oriented view? When it was just being set up, a comrade in charge of the committee's liaison work would start talking about drawings and plans as soon as he spoke to other committee members. This is a purely production-oriented view.

But another group of comrades proposed mobilizing the masses to "seize the revolution and promote production," and they must not fall into the trap of a purely production-oriented view. They put forward a clear slogan: All power to the revolutionary left!

Revolutionary work must follow the mass line. Originally, a comrade in charge of liaison work, because he did not follow the mass line, accomplished nothing in four days. Later, by emphasizing politics and following the mass line, the organization was quickly established.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. Especially in times of fundamental changes in the socio-economic system, this is even more so." The key is to educate the masses and arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

At first, some people could not understand: "You seize power? So-and-so wants to be a section chief." They thought that seizing power was just to show off. The committee explained to the masses: The "Revolutionary Production Committee" is to seize power, the "Revolutionary Production Committee" is to seize power for the party, for the people, for Mao Zedong Thought. This power must be seized, it cannot be left unseized. This concerns the fate and future of our country. The revolutionary left in power is not a few individuals in power. The service personnel of the committee are not the past leaders. The committee will thoroughly smash the old and establish the new, building a completely new relationship between people.

All service personnel repeatedly studied and discussed, and finally the entire factory held a meeting, recalling and comparing, remembering bitterness and sweetness. The workers excitedly said: "The new organization is indeed better than the old organization! The 'Revolutionary Production Committee' is good." Even some workers in the Red Guards who were previously deceived said: "You are right, we firmly support you! The Red Guards stopping work to go to Beijing is wrong! When they return, we will return their armbands to them!"

Spiritual Face Completely Changed

The revolution and rebellion are for liberating the productive forces of society, for transforming people's thoughts, and for making a leap in the relationship between people and in people's spiritual outlook.

As soon as the "Revolutionary Production Committee" was born in Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory, it brought about unprecedented changes in the relationships between people in the factory. The situation that Chairman Mao enthusiastically praised, "Never before have the people been so spirited, so full of vigor, so full of initiative," has now appeared in Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory.

This is:

The phenomenon of leaders being high above the masses and detached from reality has disappeared. The ten service personnel of the "Revolutionary Production Committee" all carry the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and labor tools with them, and they are truly the masses' close friends. The service personnel of the committee say to the old workers: "You treat us as little apprentices"; they say to the young workers: "You treat us as little brothers." They do not sit in offices, do not sit on armchairs, and they are indeed new service personnel for politics, production, and life, and they are the people's servants.

The spiritual shackles are smashed, and the workers' sense of labor initiative is greatly enhanced, and the enthusiasm for revolutionary production is doubled.

A master in the steel window workshop said: For the sake of supporting the new thing, we unite the team, do a good job in the revolution, and do a good job in production.

Just when 800 pot wheels needed management, fitter Wang Ying changed his trade and took on the heavy responsibility, changing from long shifts to morning and afternoon shifts, even neglecting to take care of his children at home.

Machinist Yan Jiazhuo voluntarily repaired the 200-kilogram air hammer that had been broken for a long time in the forging workshop.

The lathe group comrades are also full of vigor, actively assisting other workshops, and striving for victory in both revolution and production. On January 9, young apprentice Wang Weitai, in order to let the assembly workshop comrades assemble the upper and middle hand-crank machines, displayed his sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm and completed the processing of 64 machine bases in one day, exceeding the quota of 26 by more than one hundred percent.

The great change in people's spiritual outlook brought about a great change in the factory's production outlook. A brand-new, revolutionary, and communist factory has appeared before us. Like any new thing, it has boundless vitality. It is a fatal blow to the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line. It is a solid guarantee for the realization of Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production." It will undoubtedly have a profound impact on the further revolutionization of industrial and mining enterprises across the city and the country, and it will undoubtedly add a glorious chapter to the history of the international communist movement!

    伟大毛泽东思想哺育下的又一新生事物
　　——上海玻璃机械厂“革命生产委员会”调查报告
    伟大的毛泽东思想哺育着新生事物的成长。
    现在我们介绍的上海玻璃机械厂在文化大革命中创造的“革命生产委员会”，就是一个共产主义的崭新的组织形式的萌芽，是一项划时代的伟大创举。
    上海玻璃机械厂是一个中型厂，有一千二百多名工人，文化大革命开展以前是公私合营厂。
    解放前，老板王逸民残酷地剥削工人，老板的大小爪牙、封建帮会像毒蛇一样，死死盘缠着工人，吮吸着工人的血汗。
    解放后，这批家伙采取了“拉出来，打进去”的办法，一方面腐蚀党派进厂的干部，一方面乔装打扮，混入党内。这些剥削者与蜕化变质分子狼狈为奸，招降纳叛，结党营私，把他们的亲信，徒子徒孙安插在各个重要部门，严密地控制了全厂。真是水泼不进，针插不进，俨然一个独立王国。
    在经济上，更是为所欲为：“多吃多占不当事，评奖升级一句话”。一九六三年评级时，干部一升就是两级，而工人一般的只能升二分之一级或三分之一级。总之，在厂里，只要为这些家伙卖命效劳的，就可以拉他入党，封他为“五好工人”，评奖升级格外照顾。如果谁敢于摸一下他们的老虎屁股，他们就处心积虑地对你打击报复，实行资产阶级专政。长期以来，这些走资本主义道路的当权派横行霸道，不可一世，干尽了祸国殃民的事情。广大工人无不咬牙切齿，怒火满腔。
      这个权非夺不可！
    平地一声春雷，由我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲手点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火席卷了全国，敲响了一切党内走资本主义道路的当权派、一切牛鬼蛇神的丧钟。
    但是敌人是不甘心于自己的灭亡的，他们困兽犹斗，垂死挣扎。由上海市委中一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派一手策划，刮起了经济主义的妖风。这正中上海玻璃机械厂走资本主义道路的当权派的下怀。这批家伙煽动大批工人赤卫队员离开生产岗位，炮打无产阶级司令部。
    一时间，生产受到了严重影响。例如，铸造车间一百四十人中走了三十五人；三十多个造型工只剩下十几个；八个生产小组长走了一半；四个技术员只剩下一个。而车间的三个当权派，有两个积极支援赤卫队外出，整天为赤卫队送馒头，把生产完全置于脑后而不顾，造成严重的窝工和停工。
    眼看着社会主义建设遭受严重损失，眼看着阶级敌人明目张胆地破坏无产阶级文化大革命，工人造反队的同志们个个义愤填膺，怒不可遏。长期以来郁积着的对那些走资本主义道路的当权派的仇恨像火山一样迸发了！这个权——非夺不可！
    一场尖锐的斗争
    让那班老爷们靠边站！
    我们工人要自己解放自己，自己管理自己。
    一个可纪念的日子，一九六六年十二月二十七日，上海玻璃机械厂贴出了第一张夺权的大字报。大字报要求成立“工人生产管理委员会”（即“革命生产委员会”），取代原来的领导班子，把革命抓起来，把生产搞上去！这张大字报说出了广大工人造反队员和革命工人的心愿，马上有一百多人在大字报上签了名。
    从此，上海玻璃机械厂的文化大革命转入了一个新的高潮。成立“革命生产委员会”，“抓革命，促生产”的春潮涌向全厂。
      “革命生产委员会”是发扬无产阶级大民主，按照巴黎公社全面选举制的原则，经过群众充分酝酿，采取无记名投票的方法产生的。这样产生的委员，不是上级委派任命的，而是群众自己选举的最满意、最信赖的人。选出来的“革命生产委员会”的成员，既是政治上的积极分子，又是生产上的能手。
      “革命生产委员会”的委员，一律称为服务员，彻底废除过去的什么“长”之类的职称。服务员分工包管厂内各项工作，分为政治服务员、生产服务员、工会服务员等。在“革命生产委员会”中，凡是不称职的人，群众有权随时罢免或撤换。这样，就最充分地、最有效地发扬和保证实行无产阶级大民主。
      “革命生产委员会”是一个新生事物，它要和四旧作彻底的决裂。因此，“革命生产委员会”在建立过程中，和形形色色的右倾机会主义及各种软弱无能的思想进行了坚决斗争：
    十二月二十七日，赤卫队二百多人停工后，厂里贴出一张大字报，要求成立“革命生产委员会”，这件事震动很大，立即在骨干队伍中引起了斗争。
    一部分人说：原班人马“门槛精”，可以利用他们管理技术。
    但是有人坚决反对，理由是：要革命就彻彻底底，不搞调和折衷。造反是创路，不是借路。原班人马不值得迷信。
    群众最能鉴别真理，于是发动全厂讨论。一场激烈的辩论展开了。百分之八十的群众一致要求以前的四个科长靠边站，下车间劳动。
    是“抓革命，促生产”，还是单纯的生产观点？刚筹备成立时，有一个负责委员会联络的同志，一和其他委员说起来就是图纸、计划。这就是单纯的生产观点。
    而另一部分同志则提出发动群众“抓革命，促生产”，决不能堕入单纯的生产观点。他们提出鲜明的口号：一切权力归革命左派！
    革命工作非走群众路线不可。原来负责联络的一个同志，因不走群众路线，搞了四天，一事无成。后来突出政治，走群众路线，这个组织很快就建立起来了。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”关键问题在于教育群众，用毛泽东思想武装群众的头脑。
    起初，有一些人想不通：“你们夺权？某某人想当科长。”认为夺权就是出风头。委员会就向群众讲清楚：“革命生产委员会”就是要夺权，“革命生产委员会”就是要为党争权，为人民争权，为毛泽东思想争权，这个权不争是不行的，非争不可。这关系到我们国家的命运和前途，革命左派当权不是某几个人当权，委员会的服务员决不是过去的当权派，委员会要大破四旧，大立四新，建立崭新的人与人之间的关系。
    全体服务员反复学习讨论，最后全厂召开大会，回忆对比，忆苦思甜，工人们激动地说：“新组织硬是比旧组织好！‘革命生产委员会’就是好。”连有些过去受蒙蔽的工人赤卫队员也说：“你们作得对，我们坚决支持你们！赤卫队停工上北京，方向就是错！等他们回来，我们把袖章退还给他们！”
      精神面貌焕然一新
    革命造反为着解放社会生产力，为着改造人的思想，使人与人之间的关系，人们的思想面貌来一个飞跃。
      “革命生产委员会”在上海玻璃机械厂一诞生，就使这个厂人与人之间的关系出现了前所未有的变化。毛主席热情赞美的“从来也没有看见人民群众像现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发”的局面，现在已在上海玻璃机械厂出现了。
    这就是：
    过去领导高高在上，脱离群众，脱离实际的现象没有了。“革命生产委员会”的十个服务员个个做到《毛主席语录》、劳动工具不离身，他们是群众真正的贴心人。委员会的服务员对老工人说：“你们把我们当作小徒弟”；他们对青年工人说：“你们把我们当作小兄弟。”他们不蹲办公室，不坐沙发椅，的确是崭新的政治、生产、生活的服务员，是人民的勤务员。
    精神枷锁砸烂了，工人的劳动自觉性大大提高，革命生产的干劲倍增。
    钢窗车间有位老师傅说：我们为了支持新生事物，把小组团结起来，搞好革命，搞好生产。
    正当八百只锅轮要人管的时候，钳工王瑛改变工种，主动挑起了重担，从长日班改开早、中班，连家里小孩也顾不得照顾。
    机修工严家忠，主动修好了锻工车间里长期坏了的二百公斤的空气锤。
    车工组同志也意气风发，大力协助其他工段，力争革命、生产双胜利。一月九日，青年艺徒王维泰为了让装配组的同志能把上、中手摇机装配起来，发挥冲天革命干劲，一天完成了六十四只机座的加工任务，比原定额二十六只超额了一倍多。
    人们的精神面貌大变化，带来了工厂生产面貌的大变化。一个崭新的共产主义的革命化的工厂在我们的面前出现了。它和任何新生事物一样，具有无限的生命力。它对资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，是一个致命的打击。它对实现毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，是一个切实的保障。它必将对全市、全国工矿企业的进一步革命化产生极为深远的影响，它必将为国际共产主义运动史写上光辉的篇章！
