The imperialist United States and the Soviet revisionist leadership, on the basis of their extensive global deals last year, are preparing to further intensify their comprehensive collusion in the new year. They are actively promoting their joint anti-China agenda, aiming to extinguish the revolutionary flames in Vietnam and to cooperate in dominating the world.

Just after the New Year, the United States imperialists have repeatedly expressed this intention to the Soviet revisionists. In his State of the Union address on January 10, U.S. President Johnson proudly listed the actual results of the global deals between the U.S. and the Soviet Union last year. He also expressed his intention to continue negotiations with the Soviet revisionists on "disarmament" and "control" of nuclear weapons, and to push for legislation in the U.S. Congress to expand trade with the Soviet Union and ratify the U.S.-Soviet consular treaty to promote U.S.-Soviet relations.

At the same time, according to U.S. news agencies, Johnson has instructed the new U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Thompson, to carry a secret letter to the Soviet leaders. The tone of the letter is that the United States is willing to do everything possible to improve relations with the Soviet Union and to reach various disarmament agreements. It is reported that before Thompson's departure for Moscow, Johnson instructed him to try to persuade the Soviet leaders to further serve the U.S. "peace talks" plot on the Vietnam issue. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk said in a television speech on January 1 that he hopes to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union this year on the major plot and deception of the "Non-Proliferation Treaty."

In coordination with these statements and actions of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership has also repeatedly expressed its willingness to further collude with U.S. imperialism. On January 10, Soviet representative to the United Nations, Fedin, openly expressed his willingness to assist the U.S. in its "bombing to force talks" and "stop bombing to lure talks" deception in a U.S. television program. He advocated that the U.S. "stopping the bombing of North Vietnam" would "help create certain conditions." He even expressed the hope to end the Vietnam War to "make our (U.S.-Soviet) relations develop in the best way." Recently, Soviet publications have frequently advocated "stopping the bombing and talks" on the Vietnam issue. It is revealed that the Soviet revisionists are vigorously advocating for the U.S. to "downgrade" the bombing of North Vietnam in exchange for "talks," and no longer insist on the deceptive claim that no major agreements can be reached between the U.S. and the Soviet Union before the end of the Vietnam War. Instead, they are seeking "understanding with Washington" despite the exposure and condemnation by the Chinese people and the people of the world of their betrayal.

The Soviet revisionists' active policy of fully surrendering to U.S. imperialism has made U.S. imperialism feel "optimistic" and "inspired" about the prospect of further collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union this year.

Thompson said upon his arrival in Moscow on January 11 that the prospect of "improving" U.S.-Soviet relations is "good." A British newspaper recently reported from Washington that there is an unusually optimistic atmosphere in Washington regarding the development of U.S.-Soviet relations. Some U.S. monopoly capitalist newspapers could not help but proclaim: "The thaw in U.S.-Soviet relations may develop in 1967," and "the biggest development in foreign policy this year will be the informal alliance between the U.S. and the Soviet Union."

Western newspapers acknowledge that the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are tightening their collusion out of their "common interests" in jointly opposing China. The U.S. "Daily News" recently reported from Washington that Washington and Moscow have been "exchanging views and information" in increasingly intimate private talks about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The U.S. "Christian Science Monitor" also mentioned in a report that there have been some "unusually harmonious" exchanges between U.S. and Soviet diplomats recently, which they believe is useful for both sides to direct their arrows at China.

### 美苏今年要大搞反革命全球交易  矛头直接指向中国　力图扑灭越南战火　加紧玩弄裁军骗局

    美苏今年要大搞反革命全球交易
    矛头直接指向中国　力图扑灭越南战火　加紧玩弄裁军骗局
    新华社十七日讯　美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团在去年大搞全球交易的基础上，正准备在新的一年里进一步加紧全面勾结，积极推行它们联合反华，扑灭越南人民革命烈火和美苏合作主宰世界的大阴谋。
    新年刚过，美帝国主义就接连向苏修表示了这种意图。美国总统约翰逊在一月十日发表的“国情咨文”里颇为满意地列举了去年美苏进行全球大交易所取得的实际结果，同时表示今年要继续在“裁军”和“控制”核武器等问题上同苏修搞交易，并且表示要让美国国会通过扩大同苏联贸易的法案和批准美苏领事条约以促进美苏关系。
    与此同时，据美国通讯社透露，约翰逊已经让新任美国驻苏联大使汤普森带给苏联领导人一封密信。信的基调是表示“美国要尽一切努力来改善同苏联的关系和达成各种裁军协议的愿望”。据报道，在汤普森动身赴莫斯科以前，约翰逊曾经指示他设法促使苏联领导人在越南问题上进一步为美国的“和谈”阴谋奔走效劳。美国国务卿腊斯克在一月一日的电视讲话中表示，希望能在今年同苏联就缔结“防止核扩散”条约这个大阴谋和大骗局达成协议。
    同美帝国主义的这些言论和行动相配合，苏联修正主义领导集团也不断表示要进一步同美帝勾结。苏联驻联合国代表费德林一月十日在美国电视节目中公开表示愿意为美帝“以炸迫和”、“停炸诱和”的骗局出力，鼓吹什么美国“停止轰炸北越”“将有助于创造某种条件”。他甚至表示希望结束越南战争以“使我们（美苏）的关系得到最好的发展”。最近，苏联报刊也在越南问题上频繁地叫嚷“停炸和谈”。据透露，苏修正在大力鼓吹以美国对越南北方轰炸“降级”来换取“和谈”，同时已经不再坚持所谓在越南战争结束以前苏美不可能达成重大协议这种骗人的说法，而是要不顾中国人民和世界各国人民对它的叛卖行径的揭露和谴责，寻求“同华盛顿的谅解”。
    苏修这种积极推行全面投降美帝的政策，使得美帝国主义对今年美苏进一步勾结的前景感到“乐观”和“鼓舞”。
    汤普森在一月十一日到达莫斯科时说，“改善”美苏关系的前景是“良好的”。一家英国报纸最近从华盛顿报道说，对于美苏关系的发展，“华盛顿洋溢着一种异乎寻常的乐观气氛”。一些美国垄断资产阶级报刊也情不自禁地宣扬：美苏关系的“解冻”“在一九六七年可能发展”，在今年需要密切注意的“最大的外交政策发展，就是美苏间的非正式联盟”。
    西方报刊承认，美帝和苏修加紧勾结是出于它们要联合反华的“共同利益”。美国《每日快报》最近从华盛顿报道说，华盛顿和莫斯科之间在“变得更加亲密的私下谈话”中一直在就中国的无产阶级文化大革命“交换意见和消息”。美国《基督教科学箴言报》在一篇报道中也提到，最近美苏外交官之间有着一些“不寻常地融洽”的交往，他们认为这对于双方把矛头指向中国“都是有用的”。
