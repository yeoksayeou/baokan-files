	According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 8th, Singapore: The Singapore Socialist Front's organ, *Frontline*, published an article on the 1st stating that the People's Republic of China, led by the great and wise leader of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, has become the center and beacon of the world revolution.

	The article said, with this radiant beacon, the world's revolutionary people have a correct direction and a strong backbone.

	The article said, since Khrushchev and his successors betrayed the revolution and pursued a policy of "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," "the heart and red capital of the world revolution have shifted from Moscow to Beijing." China has resolutely, powerfully, sincerely, and passionately aided the world revolution, aided oppressed nations and peoples, and aided all countries and peoples engaged in anti-imperialist, anti-colonial, anti-oppression, and anti-aggression just struggles. Therefore, people of various countries increasingly yearn for and love New China. They naturally regard revolutionary New China as a beacon and a symbol of Asia and the world's future.

	The article said, "The U.S. imperialism, which is hostile to all the peoples of the world, and its running dogs, with the Soviet revisionist leadership as the center, all regard revolutionary China as a thorn in their side and a splinter in their flesh." "They are tightening their collusion, joining forces, forming a worldwide anti-China alliance, and attempting to isolate China and 'contain' China." However, the objective situation develops in the opposite direction of the reactionaries' subjective wishes. "China is not isolated. The peoples of the whole world yearn for it limitlessly. Those who are truly isolated are not revolutionary China, but counter-revolutionary U.S. imperialism and all the big and small ghosts and demons in the world."

	The article said, China has not collapsed under U.S. imperialism's "containment," but has become increasingly consolidated and powerful. China has recently successfully conducted another nuclear test, "completely breaking the U.S.-Soviet duopoly on nuclear weapons, shattering U.S. imperialism's nuclear blackmail, greatly boosting the morale of the world's revolutionary people, and crushing the arrogance of imperialism and reactionaries in various countries."

	The article then strongly condemned Soviet modern revisionism's collusion with U.S. imperialism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, engaging in treacherous acts of selling out the revolution.

	The article pointed out, the U.S. imperialism, which is being beaten black and blue by the Vietnamese people's war, "especially needs the services of Soviet modern revisionism. And the Soviet modern revisionism and its followers do not disappoint U.S. imperialism's expectations, closely cooperating with U.S. imperialism, working hard, and attempting to sell out the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation." "The 'peace talks' fraud and 'bombing to force negotiations' tricks played by U.S. imperialism are all secretly plotted with Soviet leaders or strategized and advised by Soviet leaders." The article said, "The treacherous actions of Soviet modern revisionism and its followers are a sabotage of the world people's revolution, a trampling of proletarian internationalism, and a placing of themselves in opposition to more than 90% of the people in the world. Therefore, we must recognize that Soviet modern revisionists are not friends of the revolutionary people but enemies, and are our objects of struggle. We must not only overthrow imperialism but also overthrow revisionism, and rebel against them. Some people advocate 'joint actions' with Soviet modern revisionism, which is utterly absurd. How can revolutionaries engage in 'joint actions' with traitors to the revolution? Where in the world are there such revolutionaries who cannot distinguish between enemies and friends?"

	The article concluded, "The seas surge with clouds and water, and the winds and thunder shake the five continents.' Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of China and the world's people, these two lines of poetry are the most vivid portrayal of the current world situation. The lifespans of imperialism and its running dogs will not be long, and the revolutionary cause of the world's people is advancing towards comprehensive victory."

    新加坡《阵线报》指出苏美勾结“遏制”中国的阴谋遭到破产
    中国是世界革命的中心革命人民的靠山
    革命者必须革帝国主义和修正主义的命，造它们的反
    据新华社八日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡社会主义阵线机关报《阵线报》一日发表文章指出，中国人民和世界人民伟大、英明的领袖毛泽东主席领导的中华人民共和国已经成为世界革命的中心和灯塔。
    文章说，有了这个光芒四射的灯塔，世界革命人民就有了正确的方向和坚强的靠山。
    文章说，自从赫鲁晓夫及其继承人背叛了革命，奉行“美苏合作主宰世界”的政策后，“世界革命的心脏和红都已从莫斯科移到北京。”中国最坚决、最有力、最诚恳、最热情地援助世界革命，援助被压迫民族和人民，援助一切进行反帝反殖、反压迫、反侵略的正义斗争的国家和人民。因此，各国人民越来越向往新中国、热爱新中国。他们理所当然地把坚持革命的新中国当作灯塔，当作亚洲和世界的未来的象征。
    文章说，“同全世界人民为敌的美帝国主义及其走狗、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义都把革命的中国看作眼中钉、肉中刺。”“它们加紧勾结、狼狈为奸，组成世界性的反华大同盟，妄图孤立中国，‘遏制’中国。”然而，客观形势的发展总是走向反动派主观愿望的反面。“中国并没有孤立。全世界人民无限向往它。真正遭到孤立的，不是革命的中国，而是反革命的美帝国主义以及世界上一切大大小小牛鬼蛇神。”
    文章说，中国并没有在美帝国主义的“遏制”下垮下去，而是越来越巩固，越来越强大。中国最近又一次成功地进行了新的核爆炸，“彻底打破了美苏两大国对核武器的垄断，粉碎了美帝国主义的核讹诈，大大地长了世界革命人民的志气，灭了帝国主义和各国反动派的威风。”
    文章接着强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲进行出卖革命的罪恶勾当。
    文章指出，被越南人民战争打得焦头烂额的美帝国主义“特别需要苏联现代修正主义的效劳。而苏联现代修正主义及其追随者也不负美帝国主义期望，同美帝国主义紧密配合，卖力效劳，企图出卖越南人民的抗美救国斗争。”“美帝国主义玩弄的‘和谈’骗局、‘以炸迫和’等等把戏，都是同苏联领导人秘密策划，或者由苏联领导人出谋献策搞出来的。”文章说，“苏联现代修正主义及其追随者这种无耻的叛徒行径，是对世界人民革命的破坏，是对无产阶级国际主义的蹂躏，是把自己放在同全世界百分之九十以上人民对立的地位上。因此，我们必须认清，苏联现代修正主义者不是革命人民的朋友，而是革命人民的敌人，是我们斗争的对象。我们不但要革帝国主义的命，也要革修正主义的命，造它们的反。有人主张同苏联现代修正主义搞什么‘联合行动’，这真是荒唐透顶。革命者怎能同革命的叛徒搞‘联合行动’呢？世界上哪有这样敌友不分的革命者呢？”
    文章最后说，“‘四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。’中国和世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席这两句诗是对当前世界形势的最生动写照。帝国主义及其走狗的寿命不会很长了，世界人民的革命事业正在走向全面的胜利。”
