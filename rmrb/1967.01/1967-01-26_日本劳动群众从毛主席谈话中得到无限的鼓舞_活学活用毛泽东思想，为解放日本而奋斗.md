Japanese workers have drawn endless inspiration from Chairman Mao's remarks and are actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to fight for the liberation of Japan.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 24th, on the eve of the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Statement Supporting the Just Struggle of the Japanese People Against U.S. Imperialism and for National Independence," workers from various parts of Japan have enthusiastically expressed their gratitude to the great leader Chairman Mao for pointing out a clear direction for the Japanese people's struggle for independence and liberation. They chant a thousand and ten thousand times, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!"

Three years ago, a social activist from Yabusekimachi, Fukuoka Prefecture, who participated in the struggle to surround the U.S. military base in Itazuke, told a Chinese reporter that Chairman Mao's "Statement Supporting the Just Struggle of the Japanese People Against U.S. Imperialism and for National Independence," issued the day after they surrounded the U.S. military base, gave a high evaluation of the Japanese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism and for national independence. This is the unlimited support and encouragement from Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people to the Japanese people.

He said, "Chairman Mao said, 'The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride on its head forever.' I have always kept Chairman Mao's words in mind."

A trade union worker from Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, said that Chairman Mao's remarks have boosted the confidence of the Japanese people in winning victory. He expressed his belief that, as Chairman Mao pointed out, the struggle of the Japanese people will definitely win victory.

A teacher from Tokyo said, "We have made up our minds to study Mao Zedong Thought, popularize Mao Zedong Thought, and advance on the road indicated by Chairman Mao's 'Statement Supporting the Just Struggle of the Japanese People Against U.S. Imperialism and for National Independence'!"

A worker from the San'ya district of Tokyo, a branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), said that Chairman Mao's "Statement Supporting the Just Struggle of the Japanese People Against U.S. Imperialism and for National Independence" three years ago expressed Chairman Mao's expectations and hopes for the Japanese people.

The San'ya workers condemned a small group of people who claim to be "revolutionaries" but have degenerated into modern revisionists. They said: Today, the most reliable, true vanguard of the world revolution is only the Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao Zedong. We, the San'ya comrades, hope to study Mao Zedong Thought together, actively apply Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and strive together for the liberation of Japan.

An old farmer from the suburbs of Tokyo named Uehara said, "Now, the U.S. imperialists have established hundreds of military bases in various parts of Japan. We should thoroughly understand the essence of Chairman Mao's high evaluation of the Japanese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism and for national independence."

　　日本劳动群众从毛主席谈话中得到无限的鼓舞
　　活学活用毛泽东思想，为解放日本而奋斗
    据新华社东京二十四日电　在毛主席《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》发表三周年前夕，日本各地劳动群众热烈地表示感谢伟大的领袖毛主席给日本人民争取独立与解放的斗争指出了明确的方向。他们千遍万遍地欢呼世界人民心中的红太阳——伟大的毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    三年前曾经参加过包围板付美军基地斗争的福冈县行桥市的一位社会活动家对中国记者说，毛主席在我们包围美军基地的第二天发表的《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》，对我们日本人民反美爱国正义斗争作了极高的评价，这是毛主席、中国共产党和中国人民对日本人民的无限的支持和鼓励。
    他说，毛主席说：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”我一直把毛主席的这段话牢记在心上。
    山口县下关市的一个工会工作者说，毛主席的谈话增强了日本人民争取胜利的信心。他表示相信，正如毛主席所指出的那样，日本人民的斗争一定能够取得胜利。
    东京的一位教师说：“我们下定决心学习毛泽东思想，普及毛泽东思想，在毛主席《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》所指出的道路上前进！”
    日中友好协会（正统）东京山谷贫民区支部的工人说，毛主席三年前《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》，表现了毛主席对日本人民的期待和希望。
    山谷工人谴责一小撮自称“革命”的人已经堕落成为现代修正主义。他们说：在今天，最可信赖的、真正的世界革命的先锋队只有毛泽东主席领导的中国共产党。我们山谷的伙伴们希望共同学习毛泽东思想，活学活用毛泽东思想。把毛泽东思想作为武器，为日本的解放共同奋斗。
    东京郊区的一位叫上原的老农民说：“现在美帝在日本各地建立了几百个军事基地。我们应当很好地领会毛主席对日本人民反美爱国正义斗争给予高度评价的实质。”
