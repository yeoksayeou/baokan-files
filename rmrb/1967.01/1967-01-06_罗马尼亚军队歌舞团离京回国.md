The Romanian Army Song and Dance Troupe, led by Colonel Apostol Emil and Colonel Dinu Stelian, concluded their visit and performances in China. Tonight, they departed Beijing by train to return to their home country.

During their stay in Beijing, the troupe watched performances by the capital's and the military's artists, including the modern revolutionary Peking opera "The Red Lantern," the ballet "Red Detachment of Women," the play "Drums Along the Equator," and the wide-screen epic film "East Is Red." They also visited the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution and the sculpture "The Opium Dens." Some Romanian artists expressed great admiration for the performances by Chinese artists, saying, "After watching your performances, we see that your Cultural Revolution has eliminated the old and added much that is new, which is very good." They also said, "Through the Cultural Revolution, China will certainly achieve even greater success."
