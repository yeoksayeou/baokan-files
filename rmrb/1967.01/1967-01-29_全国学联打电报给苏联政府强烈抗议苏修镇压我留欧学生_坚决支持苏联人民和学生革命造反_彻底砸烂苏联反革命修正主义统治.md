	All-China Students' Federation Cables Soviet Government Strongly Protesting Soviet Revisionists' Suppression of Chinese Students in Europe

	Firmly Support Soviet People and Students in Revolutionary Rebellion

	Thoroughly Smash Soviet Counter-Revolutionary Revisionist Rule

	New China News Agency, January 28th

	The All-China Students' Federation, representing all Chinese students, sent a telegram of protest to the Soviet Council of Ministers on the 27th, expressing the strongest protest against the Soviet revisionist leadership's heinous crime of bloodily suppressing our students studying in Europe.

	The telegram of protest reads as follows:

	"The revolutionary action of our students laying a wreath at Lenin's mausoleum and reciting Chairman Mao's quotations is absolutely right! It is excellent! Excellent! You bastards are terrified. You are terrified of the great influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. You are terrified that the Soviet people will grasp the great thought of Mao Zedong, rise up in rebellion against you, seize your power, overthrow you, and smash your heads! Listen up, you heads of the Soviet revisionist clique, Brezhnev and Kosygin: the Chinese people and students armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong are not to be trifled with. You have not settled the old score of suppressing Chinese students, and now you have incurred a new debt of blood. Blood debts must be repaid in blood. The Chinese people and students will not let you off!

	"Our most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao says: 'All the reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All the reactionaries are merely paper tigers. The people's revolutionary power is invincible. The reactionaries' power, which appears so terrifying, is in essence a mere paper tiger.' Today, the sparks of revolutionary rebellion have already appeared on the soil of the Soviet Union. We, the Chinese people and students, vow to unite with the great Soviet people and students, firmly support the Soviet people and students in overthrowing you one by one, stomping you underfoot, and ensuring that you never rise again, and smashing your counter-revolutionary revisionist rule in the Soviet Union to smithereens. Let the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in the sky above Red Square!"

　　全国学联打电报给苏联政府强烈抗议苏修镇压我留欧学生
　　坚决支持苏联人民和学生革命造反
　　彻底砸烂苏联反革命修正主义统治
    新华社二十八日讯　中华全国学生联合会代表全中国学生二十七日给苏联部长会议发出了一封抗议电，对苏联修正主义领导集团血腥镇压我国留欧学生的滔天罪行表示最最强烈的抗议。
    这封抗议电写道：
    “我国留学生在列宁陵墓前献花圈和朗读毛主席语录，是百分之百的革命行动，好得很！好得很！！你们这些混蛋却怕得要死。你们就是害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响，就是害怕苏联人民掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，起来造你们的反，夺你们的权，革你们的命，砸烂你们的狗头！苏修集团的头子勃列日涅夫和柯西金，你们竖起耳朵听着：用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和学生不是好惹的。你们镇压中国学生的旧账未清，又欠下了一笔新的血债。血债要用血来还。中国人民和学生是饶不过你们的！
      “我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：‘各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。’今天，革命造反的星星之火已经出现在苏联的大地上。我们中国人民和学生誓同伟大的苏联人民和学生联合起来，坚决支持苏联人民和同学把你们一个个打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫你们永世不得翻身，把你们在苏联的反革命修正主义统治砸个稀巴烂。让马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远高高地飘扬在红场上空！”
