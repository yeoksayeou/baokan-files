The American aggressors and their South Korean lackey army recently committed another heinous massacre of the people in Quang Ngai Province, South Vietnam. The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement strongly condemning this act and calling on the people of the world to stop the invaders' bloody claws. The Chinese people firmly support the statement of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry and express great indignation and the sternest condemnation of the new bloody atrocities committed by American imperialism and its lackey, the Park Chung-hee clique.

American imperialism has been beaten to a pulp by the Vietnamese people in the Vietnam War, and it is exhausted from dragging on the conflict. Apart from playing tricks with the "peace talks," it also attempts to escalate the war and intensify the slaughter of the people to salvage its failure. Like all reactionaries, American imperialism stupidly believes that the more people it kills, the weaker the revolutionary people will become. The opposite is true: the more people it kills, the deeper the revolutionary people's hatred for the bandits, the braver their struggle, and the stronger their force. The Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation proves this point. Over the past few years, despite American imperialism dumping thousands of tons of bombs, chemical poisons, and napalm on the Vietnamese people, the heroic Vietnamese people have fought braver and braver, while American imperialism has become more and more defeated.

The Vietnamese people have said it well: no matter what savage means American imperialism uses, it cannot shake their iron will to resist American aggression and save the nation. On the contrary, it only further inspires their fighting spirit. The more people American imperialism kills in Vietnam and the more savage its methods, the more it proves that it is the most vicious enemy of the people of the world and the greatest war criminal of the contemporary era.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If the American monopoly capitalist group insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will one day be hanged by the people of the world. The same will happen to other American lackeys." The heinous crimes committed by American imperialism and its South Korean lackeys in Vietnam today will definitely be settled. The day when they are hanged by the Vietnamese people and the people of the world will not be far off.

    必须严惩美国刽子手
    本报评论员
    美国侵略者和它的南朝鲜帮凶军，最近又在越南南方广义省犯下大肆野蛮屠杀人民的滔天罪行。越南民主共和国外交部发表声明提出强烈谴责，并且呼吁全世界人民制止侵略者的血腥魔爪。中国人民坚决支持越南外交部的声明，对美帝国主义及其走狗朴正熙帮凶军这种新的血腥暴行，表示极大的愤怒和最严厉的谴责。
    美帝国主义在侵越战争中被越南人民打得焦头烂额，拖得精疲力竭。它除去耍弄“和谈”阴谋外，还妄图用战争升级和加紧屠杀人民来挽救它的失败。美帝国主义和一切反动派一样，愚蠢地以为杀人愈多，革命人民的力量就会愈小。事实恰恰相反，它们杀人愈多，革命人民对强盗们的仇恨就越深，斗争就更勇敢，力量就愈大。越南人民的抗美救国斗争，就证明了这一点。几年来，尽管美帝国主义把成千上万吨的炮弹和炸弹、化学毒药、凝固汽油弹倾泻在越南人民的头上，但是，英雄的越南人民愈战愈勇，美帝国主义却愈败愈惨。
    越南人民说得好，美帝国主义的任何野蛮手段，都不能动摇他们抗美救国的钢铁意志，相反的却只能更加激励他们的斗争勇气。美帝国主义在越南杀人愈多，手段愈野蛮，就愈加证明它是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，是当代最大的战争罪犯。
    毛主席教导我们：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”美帝国主义及其南朝鲜帮凶今天在越南犯下的滔天罪行，是一定要清算的。它们被越南人民和世界人民处以绞刑的日子不会很长了。
