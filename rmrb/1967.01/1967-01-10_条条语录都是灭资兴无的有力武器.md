In the past, when we organized the study of Chairman Mao's works, we often had the leaders put forth viewpoints and raise questions, and then let the masses check themselves against these, conducting a kind of injection-style education. The masses' initiative was not fully mobilized. Later, when we organized the study of "In Memory of Norman Bethune," we adopted a new method: mobilizing the masses to bring their problems to the study of Chairman Mao's quotations. Using this method of study, we received widespread approval from the masses and achieved immediate results.

This time, we first mobilized the cadres and activists to lead the way in identifying problems at all levels; they identified the problems themselves, and everyone evaluated them, ensuring the problems were accurately identified. Then, each person brought their own problems to the selection of Chairman Mao's quotations, selecting them individually and discussing them collectively. The activity of selecting quotations lasted for four or five days. At that time, the company did not yet have quotation books, so some comrades flipped through the first four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," while others went through all the quotations published in the header of the "People's Liberation Army Daily." During this period, everywhere you looked, people were selecting, copying, and discussing quotations. The company was in a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's quotations. Some comrades found one or two quotations insufficient and selected seven or eight, even ten. Everyone said: We want to launch a "thousand arrows" attack on the bourgeois ideas in our minds, defeating them completely. After selecting the quotations, everyone posted them on big-character posters and small-character posters. The clubhouse, dining hall, corridors, and dormitories were all covered with quotations. The soldiers were very happy, saying our company had become a "world of quotations."

From the quotations submitted by everyone, we selected ten that addressed common issues in the company, focusing on the spirit of serving the people. These ten quotations are:

1. To stand firmly with the Chinese people and serve them wholeheartedly is the sole purpose of this army.
2. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the people's interests.
3. All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people's service...
4. A Communist should be open-hearted, honest, active, and put the interests of the revolution first, subordinating personal interests to the revolutionary cause...
5. We should all learn from his selflessness. From this point, one can become a great benefit to the people. A person's abilities may be big or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person free from low tastes, a person beneficial to the people.
6. Every party member, every part of the work, every word and action, must start from the interests of the whole party and absolutely must not violate this principle.
7. Hard work is like a burden placed before us, testing our courage to bear it. Burdens come in different weights. Some people pick the light ones and avoid the heavy ones, pushing the heavy burdens onto others and choosing the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude.
8. To struggle means to have sacrifices, and the death of people is a common occurrence. But when we think of the people's interests and the suffering of the majority, dying for the people is a worthy death.
9. Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must benefit the people. If there are errors, they must be corrected, which is what it means to be responsible to the people.
10. Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person's heart ache when they think of them. Can we still have personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, or errors that we cannot abandon?

We published these ten quotations from Chairman Mao using blackboard reports and quotation boards, calling on all comrades in the company to copy them, memorize them, speak them, and use them. During marches, soldiers carried quotation boards on their backs. During labor, they placed quotation boards in the fields and by the roads, and some even wrote quotations on their hats, hoes, and the backs of their hands. During roll calls, speeches, meetings, and heart-to-heart talks, everyone spoke Chairman Mao's quotations. Cadres and soldiers could not do anything without Chairman Mao's quotations.

Based on these ten quotations, we mobilized the masses to carry out the activity of "linking with reality and using quotations." Cadres, activists, and the masses all participated, with each person speaking about one quotation. They spoke about the heroic deeds of revolutionary martyrs, advanced figures from various fields, and good people and deeds in our company. At the same time, they compared their own thoughts and actions, explaining their understanding of the quotation. Squad Leader Luo Xiangqiao, when speaking about the quotation "bearing heavy burdens," said: During the sowing period, plowing is hard work. If a few people go to plow, and you don't put in effort, then for you, the heavy burden becomes a light one. Sowing is light work, but if you are very responsible and meticulous about quality, bending over, throwing accurately, and spreading evenly, working until your back and legs ache without letting others replace you, then this light burden becomes a heavy one. Therefore, he concluded: "Burdens come in different weights. Whether a person can bear heavy burdens depends on whether they have the spirit of serving the people. With the spirit of serving the people, light burdens can become heavy ones; without the spirit of serving the people, heavy burdens can become light ones."

This study lasted for over three months. The soldiers said: During these three months, we lived in a "world of quotations." Chairman Mao's ten quotations are deeply engraved in our hearts, and we conducted a thorough cleanup of individualistic thoughts. Those who were previously unwilling to serve were corrected in their attitude. Many backward soldiers showed significant changes. Many comrades said: The "world of quotations" demolished the "private world" in our minds. Squad 3 soldier Wen Xuewu is a high school graduate who loved literature in school. He had greatly envied some writers for their "living in high buildings and receiving high royalties" and had serious thoughts of fame and fortune, regretting joining the army. This time, he brought this "target" and flipped through the first four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," selecting many quotations. Selecting one quotation meant receiving one education. Every time he selected a quotation, he was so happy that he forgot to rest, immediately wrote it down, and shared it with everyone. When he saw Chairman Mao's words in "The Tasks for 1945" that "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people's service...," he felt as if he had found a treasure, immediately copying it neatly. He said: "Chairman Mao's teachings made me understand what a person should 'live for' and what they should 'be.' I used to think not of serving the people and being a servant of the people, but of living in high buildings, receiving royalties, and wanting to be a writer. This is truly too petty." When he spoke to everyone about Chairman Mao's quotation, he conducted a deep self-examination of his ideological problems, determining to "smash the shackles of selfishness and jump out of the prison of fame and fortune," like Zhang Side, to be a completely selfless servant of the people. Soon, he went home on leave, and some old classmates advised him to return to school. He said: "I have already attended three years of 'university' and still haven't had enough, I want to continue." One classmate said: "Look, the city's asphalt roads are so smooth, unlike the army living in the mountains, always walking on those bumpy small paths." Wen Xuewu said: "Those who have walked on bumpy small paths have more stable footsteps; those who only walk on asphalt roads will fall flat on their faces when they encounter ditches and slopes."

Through this study, Chairman Mao's ten quotations became the ten "bayonets" for our entire company to fight the battle of destroying the bourgeoisie and promoting communism, eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit. When one has problems, use these ten quotations to examine and check; when others have problems, use these ten quotations to help; when the family has problems, send these ten quotations home. Many comrades have changed their study notebooks several times, and each time they change, they copy these ten quotations on the first page. New soldiers enlist, and old soldiers first teach them these ten quotations. We deeply feel that: studying Chairman Mao's works, studying shallowly, using temporarily; studying deeply, using for a lifetime.

This study also made us realize: mobilizing the masses to grasp living thoughts, the target is the clearest, and the awareness of solving problems is the highest; the masses selecting quotations, finding weapons, hit the target the most accurately, and the feelings are the deepest; the masses speaking about the experiences of studying and using quotations, the content is the most genuine, and the logic is the most profound. Last year, in the small rectification study emphasizing the "public spirit," we continued to use this method of bringing problems to the study of Chairman Mao's quotations, and we again tasted the sweetness.

    条条语录都是灭资兴无的有力武器
    解放军沈阳部队某部指挥连政治指导员　程宽和
    过去，我们在组织学习毛主席著作的时候，常常是由领导出观点，提问题，让群众去对照检查，搞注入式的教育，群众的主动精神没有充分调动起来。以后我们在组织学习《为人民服务》的时候，改用了一种新的方法，就是发动群众带着问题选学毛主席的语录。运用这种学习方法，深受广大群众欢迎，收到了立竿见影的效果。
    这次学习，首先发动干部、骨干层层带头摆问题；自己摆，大家评，把问题找准。然后，每个人都带着自己的问题选毛主席语录，自己选，大家议。选语录的活动搞了四五天。当时连队还没有语录本，有的同志翻遍了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷，有的把《解放军报》刊头上登的语录从头到尾选了一遍。在这个期间，到处都可以看到大家在选语录，抄语录，议语录。连队形成了一个活学活用毛主席语录的高潮。有些同志选了一条两条还不够，一直选了七八条、十来条。大家说：我们要对自己头脑里的资产阶级思想来个“万箭齐发”，打它个落花流水。大家把毛主席语录选出来后，就用大字报、小字报献出来。俱乐部、食堂、走廊、宿舍到处贴满了语录。战士们十分高兴，说我们连成了“语录世界”。
    我们从大家献出的语录中，针对连队里面存在的共同性的问题，围绕为人民服务的思想，精选了十条。这十条语录是：
    一，紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。
    二，我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。
    三，我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，……
    四，一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；……。
    五，我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。
    六，每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。
    七，艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。
    八，要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。
    九，我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责。
    十，无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？
    我们把这十条毛主席语录用黑板报、语录板等形式公布出去，号召全连同志抄下来，背下来，讲起来，用起来。行军时，战士就把语录板背在背上，劳动时，就把语录牌插在地头、路旁，有的还把语录写在草帽上、锄把上和手背上。点名、讲话、开会、谈心，都讲毛主席语录。干部战士一切活动都离不开毛主席语录。
    我们根据这十条语录，针对大家在学语录、用语录中提出来的问题，发动群众开展了“联系实际，讲用语录”的活动。干部讲，骨干讲，群众讲，一人一次讲一条语录。讲革命先烈的英雄事迹，讲各行各业的先进人物，讲本连的好人好事，同时对照自己的思想言行，讲清自己对这条语录的理解。七班长罗象桥在讲“挑重担子”这条语录时说：在播种期间，拉犁是个重活。几个人去拉，你不使劲，对你来说，重担子就变成了轻担子。点种是个轻活，但是你很负责，很讲究质量，弯着腰，丢得准，撒得匀，干得腰痠腿疼也不让别人换，这个轻担子也就变成重担子了。于是，他得出的结论是：“担子有轻有重。一个人能不能挑重担子，关键在于有没有为人民服务的思想。有了为人民服务的思想，轻担子可以变成重担子；缺乏为人民服务的思想，重担子也可以变成轻担子。”
    这次学习，历时三个多月。战士们说：这三个月，我们一直生活在“语录世界”里，毛主席这十条语录深深地印入我们心里了，对个人主义思想进行了一次大扫除。原来不安心服役的，端正了服役态度。一些后进战士有了显著的转变。许多同志说：“语录世界”冲垮了我们脑瓜里的“私有世界”。三班战士温学武是高中毕业生，在学校爱好文学。他曾对一些作家“身居高楼，很多稿酬”十分羡慕，成名成家思想很严重，后悔当兵吃了亏。这次他带着这个“靶子”，翻遍了《毛泽东选集》一至四卷，选出了许多条语录。选一条语录，受一次教育。每选出一条语录，他就高兴得忘了休息，马上写出来，献出去，让大家“有福同享”。他看到毛主席在《一九四五年的任务》这篇文章中讲的“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，……”这条语录，如获至宝，马上工工整整地抄下来。他说：“毛主席的这一教导，使我懂得了，一个人活着究竟应该‘为’什么？应该‘当’什么？我过去想的不是为人民服务，当人民的勤务员，而是为了住高楼，拿稿酬，一心想当作家，真是太渺小了。”他在向大家讲毛主席这条语录时，对自己的思想问题作了深刻的检查，决心“砸碎自私自利的枷锁，跳出成名成家的牢笼”，像张思德那样当完全彻底为人民服务的勤务员。不久，他请假回家，有的老同学劝他回去上大学，他说：“我已经上了三年‘大学’，还没有上够，还要上下去。”有个同学说：“你看，城市的柏油马路多平坦，哪像部队住在山沟子里，尽走那些坑坑洼洼的小道。”温学武说：“从坑坑洼洼小道上走过来的人，脚跟子更稳；只走柏油马路的人，一旦遇到沟沟坡坡，就会摔筋斗。”
    经过这次学习，毛主席这十条语录，成了我们全连同志进行灭资兴无、破私立公的战斗的十把“刺刀”。自己有问题，用这十条语录对照、检查；别人有问题，用这十条语录去帮助；家庭有问题，就把这十条语录寄回家去。许多同志，学习心得本换了几个，每换一个，就把这十条语录抄在第一页上。新同志入伍，老同志先教给他们这十条语录。我们深深地体会到：学习毛主席著作，学得浅，用一时；学得深，用一世。
    这次学习，也使我们认识到：发动群众自己抓活思想，靶子最鲜明，解决问题的自觉性最高；群众自己选语录，找武器，对得最准，感情最深；群众自己讲学语录的体会，内容最实在，道理最深刻。去年，我们在突出“公”字的小整风学习中，继续运用了这种带着问题选学毛主席语录的方法，使我们又进一步尝到了甜头。
