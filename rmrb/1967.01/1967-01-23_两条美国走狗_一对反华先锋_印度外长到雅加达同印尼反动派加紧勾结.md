Two American Running Dogs and a Pair of Anti-China Vanguards

Indian Foreign Minister Visits Jakarta to Conspire with Indonesian Reactionaries

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, the Indian reactionary government and the Indonesian right-wing military regime are tightening their collusion to serve the aggressive war policies of their American masters.

Indian Foreign Minister Chagla visited Jakarta from the 16th to the 20th, holding secret talks with Indonesian right-wing military leaders Suharto, Nasution, and Malik on a series of issues, including joint anti-China efforts and serving the U.S. imperialist's "peace talks" deception in Vietnam. According to reports, Chagla said that during his secret talks with the Indonesian right-wing military leaders, "views were completely consistent," and his visit to Jakarta was "very successful." Malik also said: "The relationship between India and Indonesia has greatly improved," and "in foreign policy issues, India and Indonesia are now standing shoulder to shoulder."

According to reports, Chagla and the Indonesian right-wing military leaders focused on plotting joint anti-China efforts during their secret talks. The Indian News Agency reported that Chagla in Jakarta launched a fierce attack on China, shouting that "China is the common enemy of India and Indonesia." He slandered China for practicing "expansionism" and said that in this regard, India and Indonesia "hold the same views." He mimicked the tone of U.S. imperialism, shouting to "contain" China. He also revealed that the Indian reactionaries, together with the Indonesian right-wing military regime, are forming an anti-China encirclement circle according to the will of U.S. imperialism. He said that it is necessary to "achieve containment of China through the development of Southeast Asian economies," and that India "fully supports" the Indonesian right-wing military regime's "any initiative that may be proposed to achieve regional unity and promote greater economic cooperation in Southeast Asia."

The Indian reactionaries and the Indonesian right-wing military regime are eagerly serving the nuclear blackmail and monopoly schemes of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Both sides attacked China in their joint statement for conducting limited nuclear tests to strengthen national defense and defend world peace, and advocated signing a "non-proliferation treaty."

The joint statement issued at the end of Chagla's visit shows that the Indonesian right-wing military regime and the Indian reactionary government openly serve the U.S. imperialist's "peace talks" deception in Vietnam, advocating the implementation of the already bankrupt "bombing halt and deception" scheme proposed by the U.S. to lead to the start of negotiations, helping the U.S. imperialists to "promote peaceful negotiations to resolve."

The Indonesian reactionary military regime openly supports the Indian reactionaries' forced annexation of Kashmir and opposes the Kashmiri people's right to self-determination. The Indian News Agency revealed that during his stay in Jakarta, Chagla loudly shouted that Kashmir is "a part of India," so self-determination or a civilian vote cannot be implemented in Kashmir. Malik openly supported the Indian reactionaries against Pakistan, praising India's unreasonable stance on the Kashmir issue as "correct." According to reports, Suharto and Malik have already assured Chagla that the "current regime does not recognize any military aid obligations to Pakistan undertaken by the previous government."

The statement expresses the determination of the two countries' leaders to further tighten their collusion and "decide to further strengthen their cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations."

　　两条美国走狗　一对反华先锋
　　印度外长到雅加达同印尼反动派加紧勾结
　  据新华社二十一日讯 雅加达消息：印度反动政府和印度尼西亚右派军人政权正在加紧勾结，为它们的美国主子的侵略战争政策效劳。
    印度外交部长查格拉十六日到二十日在雅加达进行了访问，同印尼右派军人政权头目苏哈托、纳苏蒂安、马利克等人，就共同反华、为美帝国主义在越南问题上的“和谈”骗局效劳等一系列问题进行了密谈。据报道，查格拉说，他同印尼右派军人政权头目举行密谈时，“观点完全一致”，他的雅加达之行“非常成功”。马利克也说：印度和印度尼西亚的关系“大大改善了”，“在外交政策问题上，现在印度和印度尼西亚是并肩站在一起的。”
    据报道，查格拉同印尼右派军人政权头目在密谈中着重策划了共同反华的问题。印度新闻处的消息说，查格拉在雅加达大肆攻击中国，叫嚷“中国是印度和印度尼西亚的共同敌人”。他诬蔑中国实行“扩张主义”，并说，在这方面印度和印度尼西亚“持有相同的看法”。他学着美帝国主义的腔调，叫嚷要“遏制”中国。他还透露，印度反动派同印尼右派军人政权一道，按照美帝国主义的意旨在拼凑反华包围圈。他说，要“通过发展东南亚的经济来实现”对中国的“遏制”，印度“全力支持”印尼右派军人政权“为实现区域性的联合以促进东南亚的更大的经济合作而可能提出的任何倡议”。
    印度反动派和印尼右派军人政权极力为美苏的核讹诈和核垄断阴谋效劳。双方在联合公报中攻击中国为了加强国防和保卫世界和平而进行有限的核试验，并且鼓吹签订一项“非扩散条约”。
    在查格拉访问结束时双方发表的联合公报表明，印尼右派军人政权和印度反动政府公开为美帝国主义在越南问题上的“和谈”阴谋效劳，鼓吹按照美国的早已破产的“停炸诱和”方案来导致开始谈判，帮助美帝国主义“促进和平地谈判解决”。
    印尼反动军人政权公开支持印度反动派强行兼并克什米尔、反对克什米尔人民行使自决权的反动立场。印度新闻处透露，查格拉在雅加达期间大肆叫嚷克什米尔是印度的“一部分”，所以不能在克什米尔实行自决或公民投票。马利克公开支持印度反动派反对巴基斯坦，吹捧印度在克什米尔问题上的无理立场是“正确”的。据报道，苏哈托和马利克并已向查格拉保证：印尼“现政权不承认前政府对巴基斯坦承担的任何军事援助的义务”。
    公报表示两国头目今后将进一步加紧勾结，并“决心进一步加强他们两国在联合国和其他国际组织的合作”。
