    Thunder roars across the vast sky, a storm rages by the Huangpu River.
    The revolutionary rebels beat the war drums, their momentum shaking the heavens.
    The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai's workers, in the face of the new counterattack by the bourgeois reactionary line, put forward a resounding slogan: "Shouldering two heavy burdens."

    These two heavy burdens are revolution and production.
    "If we don't do the revolutionary work, who will? If we don't shoulder the burden of production, who will?" — This is the bold declaration of the revolutionary rebel workers!

    They said it, and they did it. Revolutionary rebel workers from Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory and other units, while resolutely fighting against the bourgeois reactionary line, overcame the adverse effects on production caused by the departure of a large number of personnel, and launched a magnificent new wave of production...

    The revolutionary rebel workers are truly Chairman Mao's good workers. They are the vanguards of the revolution, and they are the models of production!

    "Shouldering two heavy burdens." This is a powerful response to the tricks and schemes of a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road. Initially, they used "promoting production" as a pretext to suppress the revolution; now, they play their trump card, inciting a large number of workers to leave their production posts and disrupt production. In such a situation, the revolutionary rebel workers, in a counterattack, shouldered the two heavy burdens of revolution and production, making their schemes "a waste of effort."

    "Shouldering two heavy burdens." This shows that the revolutionary rebel workers understand the relationship between revolution and production the best. Revolution is the locomotive of history. Without revolution, the remnants of revisionism, capitalism, and feudalism in industrial and mining enterprises cannot be eliminated, those in power who are taking the capitalist road cannot be overthrown, and socialist production and construction cannot be carried out well. Only by seizing the revolution can production be promoted. We must follow the "Sixteen Points" and do as it says: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to make people's ideology revolutionary, so that all work can be done better, faster, and more efficiently."

    "Shouldering two heavy burdens." This demonstrates the revolutionary heroism of the revolutionary rebels. As early as forty-seven years ago, Chairman Mao proclaimed to the world in "Xiangjiang Pinglun": "The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not act, who will?" Today's revolutionary rebels, under new historical conditions, have inherited and carried forward this revolutionary heroism.

    Revolution and production, these two heavy burdens are indeed heavy. The revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought have strong shoulders and will definitely carry these two heavy burdens very well, blooming brilliant flowers and bearing abundant fruits!

    两副重担一肩挑
　　高红
    长空万里响惊雷，黄浦江畔起狂飙。
    革命造反擂战鼓，气势磅礴震云霄。
    上海革命造反派的工人，面对着资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，提出了一个响亮的口号：“两副重担一肩挑”。
    这两副重担，一副就是革命，一副就是生产。
    “革命的事，我们不干，谁干！生产的担子，我们不挑，谁挑！”——这就是革命造反派工人的豪言壮语！
    他们这样说了，也这样做了。上海玻璃机械厂等单位的革命造反派工人，在坚决跟资产阶级反动路线作斗争的同时，克服由于大批人员离厂对生产造成的不良影响，掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产新高潮……。
    革命造反派的工人，不愧为毛主席的好工人。他们是抓革命的闯将，他们是促生产的模范！
      “两副重担一肩挑”。这是对一小撮走资本主义道路当权派耍弄阴谋诡计的最有力的回击。当初，他们以“促生产”为幌子，拚命地压制革命；如今，他们使出“撒手锏”，唆使大批工人离开生产岗位，破坏生产。革命造反派工人，在这种情况下，针锋相对地把革命和生产两副重担一肩挑了起来，就使他们的阴谋“竹篮打水一场空”。
      “两副重担一肩挑”。这说明革命造反派的工人最懂得革命和生产的关系。革命是历史的火车头。不抓革命，工矿企业里的修正主义、资本主义、封建主义的货色就不能肃清，走资本主义道路的当权派就不能打倒，社会主义的生产建设就根本搞不好。只有抓革命，才能促生产。我们要照“十六条”说的去做：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。”
      “两副重担一肩挑”。这显示了革命造反派的革命英雄气概。早在四十七年前，毛主席就在《湘江评论》上向全世界宣告：“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”今天的革命造反派，在新的历史条件下，继承和发扬了这种革命英雄气概。
    革命和生产，这两副担子是重的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派，生就了一副铁肩膀，一定能够把这两副重担挑得非常的好，开出灿烂的花，结出丰硕的果！
