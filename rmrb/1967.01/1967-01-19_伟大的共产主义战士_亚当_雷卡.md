The heroic people of Albania have recently been enthusiastically and respectfully recounting the heroic deeds of Adam Reka, the great communist fighter who sacrificed himself for the public good.

Fighting Bravely Against Stormy Waves

On November 17 of last year, the famous Albanian port of Durrës was struck by an unprecedentedly powerful typhoon and torrential rain. At that time, the wind howled fiercely, the rain poured down, and the waves in the harbor surged. The largest floating crane (floating crane) with a lifting capacity of 120 tons was swaying violently from side to side in the fierce wind and waves, in imminent danger of capsizing.

At this moment, Reka, a crane operator who had just finished his shift and was sleeping at home, was awakened by the sudden storm. Thinking of the safety of the port equipment, he immediately put on his clothes and rushed to the port. As soon as Reka got on the floating crane, he bravely fought against the typhoon and waves with his comrades, risking his life.

At this time, the typhoon was getting stronger, with wind speeds reaching 24 to 28 meters per second. The rain was getting heavier, and the waves were getting higher. Six of the seven steel cables mooring the floating crane were broken. The floating crane swayed violently, and the situation was extremely critical. Reka and his comrades had only one thought: they must overcome the storm and rain and protect the largest floating crane in the port of Durrës and the surrounding ships. Just as they had secured the steel cables to the mooring posts of the floating crane, a giant wave knocked Reka down on the deck. But he propped himself up with his injured body and continued to fight.

The typhoon and rain did not abate. Just as Reka had finished securing the equipment on the iron frame of the floating crane, he discovered a broken cable slipping from the deck into the sea. He shouted, "Comrades, grab it quickly!" and jumped down from the iron frame, pulling it with Shek Gika. Blood flowed from his palms, but what of it! They exerted all their strength to tighten the cable and secure it to the mooring post. However, at that moment, a giant wave struck, causing the floating crane to sway violently, and Reka was struck by the steel cable, sustaining severe injuries to his head and waist.

When people took Reka to the hospital, he was still calling out in his delirium, "Comrades, don't worry about me, save the floating crane!" The medical staff did their best to save the life of this selfless communist fighter, but due to the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died gloriously on the same day.

A Heart for the Revolution

At the age of 39, Reka was an orphan from a poor family. In the old society, he had only four years of schooling before he started working as an apprentice. Later, under the nurturing of the Albanian Party of Labour, he harbored a deep class hatred towards landlords and capitalists and a national hatred towards German and Italian fascists. He successively joined the underground pioneer team and the Communist Youth League. During the enemy occupation, he had gone to the streets of Durrës, which were under the white terror, and written many patriotic and anti-imperialist slogans such as "Fascism will surely perish, the people will surely be free" with charcoal. He also helped underground workers punish traitors who sold out their country. Reka was not yet 15 years old when he joined the guerrilla forces and fought bravely for the liberation of his country.

Reka had always been enthusiastic about revolutionary work, never calculating personal gains or losses. Whatever the Party asked him to do, he did it. Wherever the Party needed him to go, he went. After the liberation of the motherland, he responded to the call of the Party of Labour and actively participated in the voluntary labor to build the railway to restore the economy destroyed by the war. Due to his outstanding political and labor performance, he was honored to be admitted to the Party in 1947. When the Party of Labour called for the reconstruction of the port of Durrës in 1949, he went to work at the port again.

Reka had always been helpful to others, caring more for others than for himself. One cold night, someone fell into the water at the port. When he heard the cry for help, he immediately jumped into the icy sea and rescued the person. When the person who had fallen into the water thanked him, although he was frozen blue, he smiled and said, "It's nothing, I just did what I should have done." Although Reka was a crane operator, he often helped sailors, mechanics, electricians, loaders, and cooks at the port, earning universal praise and respect from the people.

Reka was an outstanding member of the Albanian Party of Labour and a steadfast revolutionary fighter. After the Party Central Committee proposed a series of major revolutionary measures last year, he responded resolutely to the Party's call, proposing many revolutionary measures in his unit and breaking through outdated regulations and systems with everyone to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers. Reka paid particular attention to exposing and criticizing the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and their reactionary restoration of capitalism, and worked with everyone to resolutely eliminate and prevent the influence of revisionism.

Forever in the Hearts of the People

The reason Reka was able to become a noble person, a person who devoted himself entirely to the service of the people, is that he always consciously armed himself with Marxist-Leninist thought, constantly raised his political consciousness, and always put politics first.

He studied the works of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people. He always remembered Comrade Hoxha's teachings: "Our revolutionary party members should... resolve to serve the Party and the people to the end, under any circumstances, and be prepared to make every sacrifice for the interests of the revolution and socialism."

Comrade Reka had boundless respect and love for the great leader of the Chinese people and the red sun in the hearts of the world's people, Chairman Mao. He studied the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" carefully and often drew inspiration and strength from it.

Comrade Reka had great respect for the great communist fighter Lei Feng, who was armed with Mao Zedong Thought. He placed books and magazines introducing Lei Feng's heroic deeds on his desk in his dormitory and often read them.

In his ordinary work, Reka also contributed his strength to the friendship between Albania and China. He often told his comrades, "The fraternal Chinese people have sent us very precious construction materials. We must unload them quickly and very carefully." Once a small box fell into the sea, Reka immediately jumped in and retrieved it. On the day before his death, he was still working with Chinese sailors to load and unload goods and discussing the friendship between Albania and China.

Adam Reka was an outstanding member of the Albanian Party of Labour and a good son of the working people. He died for the interests of the people. On December 13 of last year, the Presidium of the People's Assembly of Albania issued an order to posthumously confer the title of "Hero of Socialist Labor" on Adam Reka. Workers, peasants, soldiers, and young people from all over the country have been visiting the port of Durrës where Reka used to work. Although the great communist fighter Adam Reka has passed away, his shining example of devotion to the public, devotion to the revolution, and devotion to the people will forever live in the hearts of the Albanian people.

### 伟大的共产主义战士——亚当·雷卡

    伟大的共产主义战士——亚当·雷卡
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，最近满怀激动和崇敬的心情，传颂着舍己为公的伟大共产主义战士亚当·雷卡的英雄事迹。
    同暴风险浪奋勇搏斗
    去年十一月十七日，阿尔巴尼亚著名海港都拉斯遭到历史上罕见的强大台风和暴雨的袭击。当时，狂风怒吼，暴雨如注，港内波浪翻腾，一台起重能力为一百二十吨的最大浮吊（浮动起重机）在狂风巨浪的凶猛冲击下，不停地左右摇晃，时刻有翻倒的危险。
    这时，已经下班在家睡觉的起重机工人雷卡，被突然袭来的狂风暴雨所惊醒。他想到港口设备的安全，立即披上衣服，直向港口奔去。雷卡一到浮吊上，便和其他同志一起，冒着生命危险，同台风险浪奋勇搏斗。
    这时，台风越刮越猛，风速每秒已达二十四到二十八米。暴雨越下越大，海浪越击越高。系泊浮吊的七根钢缆被冲断了六根。浮吊发生了猛烈摇摆，情况十分危急。雷卡和其他同志只有一个念头：必须战胜暴风雨，保卫住都拉斯港口这架最大的浮吊，保住周围的船舶。当他们刚把钢缆系到浮吊的缆桩上时，一个巨浪把雷卡击倒在甲板上。但他支着负伤的身体，用力猛地爬了起来，继续投入战斗。
    台风和暴雨没有减弱。雷卡刚在浮吊的铁架上护理好器材，又发现有一根断了的缆绳，从甲板上往海里滑去。他一面呼喊“同志们，快拉住！”一面从铁架上跳了下来，同谢·吉卡一起拚力地拉住它。手心流出了血，又算得什么！他们用尽全身的力气，设法拉紧缆绳，并把它系到缆桩上去。然而，就在这时，一个巨浪袭来，浮吊猛然摇摆，雷卡被钢缆剧烈一击，头部和腰部负了重伤。
    当人们把雷卡送进医院时，他在昏迷中还不断地呼喊：“同志们，别管我，抢救浮吊要紧！”医务人员竭尽全力挽救这位舍己为公的共产主义战士的生命，可是由于伤势太重，医治无效，在当天就光荣牺牲。
    一心为革命
    三十九岁的雷卡，童年是个贫苦的孤儿。在旧社会，他读过四年书便开始当学徒工。后来在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的哺育下，他怀着对地主、资本家的阶级仇和对德国、意大利法西斯的民族恨，先后参加了地下少先队和共青团。在敌人占领期间，他曾多次到白色恐怖统治下的都拉斯城街头，用墨炭写下“法西斯一定灭亡，人民一定自由”等许多爱国反帝标语。他还同其他青少年一起，帮助地下工作者惩处过出卖祖国的叛徒。雷卡还不到十五岁，就参加了游击队，为解放祖国进行了英勇的战斗。
    雷卡一贯以满腔热忱对待革命工作，从不计较个人得失。党让他干什么，他就干什么。党需要他到哪里去，他就到哪里去。祖国解放后，他响应劳动党的号召，为恢复被战争破坏的经济，积极参加了修筑铁路的义务劳动。由于他在政治上和劳动中的优良表现，一九四七年光荣地被吸收入党。当一九四九年劳动党号召重建都拉斯海港时，他又来到海港工作。
    雷卡一贯以助人为乐，他关心别人胜于关心自己。一个严寒的夜晚，港口里有人不慎落水，当他听到呼救声后，毫不犹豫立即跳进冰冷的海水里，把人救了上来。当落水者向他致谢时，尽管他冻得浑身发紫，却微笑着说：“这没有什么，我不过是做了我应该做的事情。”雷卡虽然是起重工，但经常在港口帮助水手、机械工、电工、装运工和厨师们工作，受到人们普遍的赞扬和尊敬。
    雷卡是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的优秀党员，坚定的革命战士。去年劳动党中央提出一系列重大革命化措施后，他坚决响应党的号召，在自己工作的单位提出许多革命化建议，并同大家一起打破陈旧的规章制度，充分发挥广大职工的积极性和创造精神。雷卡特别重视揭露和批判苏联修正主义领导集团的叛徒面目及其复辟资本主义的倒行逆施，同大家一起坚决肃清和防止修正主义的影响。
    永远活在人民心里
    雷卡所以能够成为一个高尚的人，一个全心全意为人民服务的人，最根本的原因是他经常自觉地以马克思列宁主义的思想武装自己的头脑，不断提高自己的政治觉悟，时时刻刻突出政治。
    他认真学习阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖霍查同志的著作。他时刻铭记着霍查同志的教导：“我们革命党的党员应该……决心在任何时候，任何条件下，至死为党，为人民服务，并准备为革命和社会主义的利益而做出一切牺牲。”
    雷卡同志对中国人民的伟大领袖，世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席，无限崇敬和无限热爱。
    他认真学习《毛泽东选集》，经常从中得到教益和力量。
    雷卡对用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国伟大的共产主义战士雷锋，十分尊敬。他把介绍雷锋英雄事迹的书刊，摆在自己宿舍的书案上，经常翻阅。
    雷卡在平凡的工作中，也为阿中友谊贡献了自己的力量。他经常对自己的同伴说：“兄弟的中国人民给我们运来了非常珍贵的建设物资，我们要尽快地卸，非常小心地卸。”有一次一个小货箱失手落入海中，雷卡立即跳下去把它捞上来。就在他牺牲的前一天，他还同中国船员一齐装卸货物，畅谈阿中友谊。
    亚当·雷卡是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的优秀党员，劳动人民的好儿子，他是为人民利益而死的。阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团去年十二月十三日颁布命令，决定追认亚当·雷卡为“社会主义劳动英雄”。全国各地的工人、农民、战士和青少年，络绎不绝地到雷卡生前工作过的都拉斯港口访问。伟大的共产主义战士亚当·雷卡虽然与世长辞了，但是他那一心为公、一心为革命、一心为人民的光辉榜样，却永远活在阿尔巴尼亚人民的心中。
