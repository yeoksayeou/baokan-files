Telegram of Salute to Chairman Mao from the Rally Celebrating the Central Committee's Congratulatory Telegram and Swearing to Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line

New China News Agency, Shanghai, January 12th — The revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai and from other places in Shanghai are celebrating the central committee's congratulatory telegram. The full text of their telegram of salute to Chairman Mao, sent at the rally swearing to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, is as follows:

Most Respected Chairman Mao:

We — all the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai who are eternally loyal to you — salute you, our great teacher, great leader, great commander, great helmsman, and the reddest red sun in our hearts, with the highest proletarian cultural revolution salute!

Most Respected Chairman Mao, as we are enthusiastically celebrating your personal decision to broadcast nationwide the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Announcement" issued by the various revolutionary mass organizations of Shanghai, your voice from Beijing has reached us again — the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai. This is your greatest concern and support for us, the greatest encouragement and spur for us. We cheer, we sing, a million words cannot express our joy, a million songs cannot express our gratitude, we can only shout a million times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand long lives!

Most Respected Chairman Mao, you always point out the general direction of our struggle at the most critical moments of the revolution; you always bring us boundless spiritual strength at the most acute moments of the struggle. You always warmly care for and support the revolutionary rebels. You always cultivate and foster all new revolutionary things. Now, in the midst of our revolutionary rebels' fierce battle against the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, you have approved our general direction, affirmed our combat mission, and supported us in carrying out the great alliance of revolutionary organizations of the proletarian revolutionaries, uniting all revolutionary forces, and firmly grasping the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the fate of the proletarian cultural revolution, and the fate of the socialist economy in our own hands. Your great and wise decision will surely quickly ignite the blazing flames of class struggle across the nation. All the counter-revolutionary economicism, all the new counterattacks by the representatives of the bourgeois reactionary line, all the strongholds of the bourgeois reactionary line will all be burned to ashes in this blazing fire!

Most Respected Chairman Mao, you have repeatedly taught us that the enemy will not disappear by itself, will not voluntarily leave the historical stage. The facts are exactly like this. A handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road in the Shanghai Municipal Committee, a few stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line, although their counter-revolutionary economicist plots have been exposed, although they have begun to collapse under the heavy encirclement of the revolutionary masses, they are still struggling desperately, using every means to try to disintegrate the great alliance of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, attempting to create divisions and quarrels among our various revolutionary rebel organizations, so that they can slip away, gain breathing time, and make a comeback. We will not let their plots succeed. We will definitely follow your teachings, "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with the remaining strength, do not seek fame like King Xiang Yu," and take unified action to pursue and attack the fleeing dogs, beating them to a pulp, beating them so they can never rise again. We will definitely implement your correct policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," thoroughly eliminating the evil influence of counter-revolutionary economicism. We will definitely not disappoint your expectations, definitely under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further unite the revolutionary rebels, unite the majority of the masses, firmly grasp the leadership of the cultural revolution and production in Shanghai, and make the proletarian cultural revolution in the Shanghai region advance victoriously along the revolutionary line represented by you!

    给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社上海十二日电　上海和外地在沪各革命造反团体欢庆中央贺电，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑誓师大会给毛主席的致敬电，全文如下：最最敬爱的毛主席：
    我们——永远忠于您的上海革命造反派全体战士，向您，我们的伟大导师，伟大领袖，伟大统帅，伟大舵手，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，致以最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，当我们正在最最热烈地欢呼您老人家亲自决定向全国广播我们上海各革命群众组织发表的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》的时候，从北京又传来了您老人家的声音——中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海各革命造反团体的贺电。这是您老人家对我们的最大关怀，最大支持的声音，这是您老人家对我们的最大鼓舞、最大鞭策的声音。我们欢呼，我们歌唱，千万句话说不尽我们的幸福心情，千万支歌唱不完我们的感谢心情，我们只有千万遍跳跃高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，您总是在革命最关键的时刻，给我们指明斗争的大方向；您总是在斗争最尖锐的时刻，给我们带来了无穷的精神力量。您永远热情地关怀和支持革命造反派。您永远培育和扶植一切革命的新生事物。现在，您又在我们革命造反派迎头痛击资产阶级反动路线新反扑的激战中间，批准了我们的大方向，肯定了我们的战斗任务，支持我们实行无产阶级革命派组织的大联合，团结一切革命力量，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里。您的这一伟大英明的决定，定将迅速点燃展开全国全面的阶级斗争的熊熊烈火。什么反革命的经济主义，什么资产阶级反动路线代表者组织的新反扑，什么资产阶级反动路线的顽固堡垒，都将统统在这场冲天烈火中烧焦、烧臭、烧成灰！
    最最敬爱的毛主席，您一再教导我们，敌人决不会自行消灭，决不会自动退出历史舞台。事实正是这样。上海市委中一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，虽然他们玩弄的反革命的经济主义阴谋已经被揭穿，虽然他们已经在革命群众的重重包围之中开始全线崩溃，但他们仍然在进行疯狂挣扎，千方百计地企图瓦解我们上海革命造反派的大联合，妄想在我们各革命造反团体中制造分裂，挑起纠纷，以便他们滑脚溜走，取得喘息时间，卷土重来。我们一定不让他们的阴谋得逞。我们一定要遵循您的教导，“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”，一致行动起来，穷追猛打落水狗，把他们打个落花流水，打得永世不能翻身。我们一定要坚决贯彻您提出的“抓革命，促生产”的正确方针，彻底肃清反革命的经济主义的恶劣影响。我们一定不辜负您的期望，一定要在毛泽东思想的大旗下，把革命造反派进一步联合起来，把群众的大多数团结起来，紧紧掌握住上海文化大革命和生产的领导权，使上海地区的无产阶级文化大革命，沿着以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进！
    祝我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
                上海和外地在沪各革命造反团体欢庆中央贺电，
                彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑誓师大会
                                      一九六七年一月十二日
