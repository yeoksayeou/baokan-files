The French version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was brought to Mali. Friends in Mali were overjoyed and eagerly grabbed copies to read, taking turns to read and copy. They said that every sentence in "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is a guide to revolution.

In the Gioliba Cigarette Factory in Bamako, there is a laboratory technician who obtained a French version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from Chinese experts. He treasures this red book as his most precious possession and reads it diligently whenever he has spare time.

One day, after work, he went home and started reading. His father returned home quietly, tiptoed into the room, and stood behind his son to see what he was reading. The technician was deeply engrossed, softly reciting one of his favorite quotations from Chairman Mao: "We are advocates of the annihilation of war, we do not want war; but war can only be eliminated by war, and it is impossible to do without a gun; those who do not want the gun must take up the gun." Seeing his son reading "Quotations from Chairman Mao," the old man happily reached out to grab the book. It turned out that the old man also deeply loved Chairman Mao and his works. At this point, the son insisted on reading first, and the father also insisted on reading first. The father and son's love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought was equally profound. Unable to reach an agreement, they finally decided to take turns reading.

　　父子争读《毛主席语录》
    《毛主席语录》法文版运到马里后，马里朋友欢欣鼓舞，他们争着要，抢着读，轮流读，轮流抄。他们说，《毛主席语录》中的每一句话都是革命的指南。
    巴马科吉奥利巴卷烟厂有一个化验员，他从中国专家那里得到一本法文版的《毛主席语录》。他把这本红书看作是他最珍贵的东西，一有空就认真阅读。
    有一天，他下班回家后就读起来。他父亲回家时轻轻地走进屋，不声不响地走到他的背后，想看看儿子到底读什么。这位化验员正在专心致志地低声念着他平时最爱讲的一条毛主席语录：“我们是战争消灭论者，我们是不要战争的；但是只能经过战争去消灭战争，不要枪杆子必须拿起枪杆子。”老人一看他儿子读的是《毛主席语录》，高兴地伸手就抢了去。原来这位老人也非常热爱毛主席和毛主席著作。这时候，儿子坚持要先读，父亲也坚持要先读，父子两人热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想的感情不分高低。两人争执不下，最后商量决定轮流着读。
