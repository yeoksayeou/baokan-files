Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: This afternoon, our heroic People's Liberation Army air force, in the skies over a certain location in East China, shot down an invading U.S.-made Nationalist F-104 fighter jet. This is a new victory achieved by our air force in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: The Central Military Commission today issued a commendation order, praising the People's Liberation Army air force unit that shot down a U.S.-made Nationalist F-104 fighter jet in the skies over a certain location in East China.

The commendation order states: Your victory is the result of responding to Comrade Lin Biao's call, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, and carrying out a thorough revolution in people's ideological transformation. This is the victory of the revolutionary line of the proletariat led by Chairman Mao, and the invincible victory of Mao Zedong Thought. We extend our warm congratulations to you.

The commendation order points out: Currently, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering a new stage. Revolutionary masses across the country are uniting to fight back against the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line under the guidance of the revolutionary line of the proletariat led by Chairman Mao. At this moment, your victory is a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses; it is a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Nationalist bandits!

The commendation order states: Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles. Even after the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will attempt to restore their power in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undeniable. We must never relax our vigilance." The Central Military Commission hopes that the air force troops will strictly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, heighten revolutionary vigilance, firmly defend their battle positions, and be ready at any time to destroy any enemy aircraft that dares to invade. In defending the safety of the country's airspace and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieve even greater victories.
