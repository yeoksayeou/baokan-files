Chinese students studying in Europe, a total of sixty, who are returning to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, left Moscow by car on the 26th. Another nine could not join them as they were seriously injured by Soviet military police and secret agents on the 25th.

At the gate of the embassy, all staff of our embassy pinned large red flowers of honor on all the students, beat drums, shouted slogans, and read Chairman Mao's quotations aloud to send them off enthusiastically.

Those who went to the station to see them off included Deputy Chief of Mission An Zhi Yuan of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Deputy Military Attaché Lin Fengshan, and dozens of other embassy officials and staff.

At the Yaroslavl Station in Moscow, our sixty anti-revisionist fighters and all the comrades who came to see them off, holding the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," with Mao badges on their chests, marched in unison to the platform. On the platform, everyone loudly read the quotations of our most, most beloved leader Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not as powerful as they seem. In the long run, the real power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

"Marxism-Leninism has thousands of truths, but they all boil down to a single sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' ... Based on this truth, we rebel, we struggle, and we build socialism."

The Soviet revisionist leadership is afraid of the truth and afraid of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Today, the Soviet revisionist authorities have placed the station platform inside and outside under strict guard, with patrol cars and prison vans parked, filled with military police and plainclothes secret agents, as if facing a major enemy. Among them, many are the same people who brutally beat our young students in Red Square on the 25th. Some of our injured female students immediately recognized them and glared at them angrily. Some of these criminals, feeling guilty, slipped away.

It was also noticed that the Soviet revisionist authorities deliberately created difficulties for our revolutionary students today. Usually, there are dozens of large and small carts for carrying luggage at Yaroslavl Station, but today there were only four small carts. It was found that many porters were not only not allowed to come out to serve, but their service certificates—the porter's badges—were also taken away in advance by the relevant Soviet revisionist authorities. However, the Soviet working class broke through the obstacles and actively came out to use large carts to carry the students' luggage.

At 3:55 PM, the train adorned with the national emblem of our country slowly left the Yaroslavl Station in Moscow, heading towards the capital of our great motherland—Beijing. At this time, our sixty revolutionary students in the train shouted revolutionary slogans, held high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and bid farewell to the comrades who came to see them off.

　　高声朗读毛主席语录　高呼革命口号
　　我反修战士昂首阔步离莫斯科回国
　　苏修当局如临大敌在车站内外密布军警，苏联朋友冲破障碍主动帮我留学生运送行李
    新华社莫斯科二十六日电　路经莫斯科回国参加无产阶级文化大革命的中国留欧学生六十人，二十六日乘车离开莫斯科回国。另外九人因二十五日被苏联军警及特务人员严重打伤，不能同行。
    在使馆门前，我使馆全体同志为所有同学戴上了大红光荣花，敲锣打鼓，高呼口号，齐声朗读毛主席语录，热烈欢送。
    前往车站欢送的有中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远、代理武官林峰山等使馆负责同志和使馆其他工作人员数十人。
    在莫斯科雅罗斯拉夫车站，我六十名反修战士和前来欢送的全体同志手持红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，胸前佩戴毛主席像章，步伐整齐地走向站台。在站台上，大家高声朗读我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
  “马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”
    苏联修正主义领导集团害怕真理，害怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想。苏联修正主义当局今天在车站站台内外戒备森严，停放着警车和囚车，布满了军警以及便衣特务，如临大敌。他们当中有许多就是二十五日在红场毒打我青年学生的一些家伙。我受伤的一些女学生一下就认出了他们，对他们怒目而视。其中一些家伙理亏心虚，偷偷溜走。
    人们还注意到，苏修当局今天还蓄意对我革命学生制造困难。通常雅罗斯拉夫车站上搬运行李的大、小推车达二、三十部之多，今天却只有四部小推车。据了解结果，许多搬运工人不但不被允许出来服务，连服务的证件——搬运工号牌都被苏修有关当局事先收去。然而，苏联的工人阶级冲破了障碍，主动出来用大推车为同学们运送行李。
    下午三点五十五分，镶着我国国徽的列车载着光荣的反修战士们徐徐离开莫斯科雅罗斯拉夫车站，奔向伟大祖国的首都——北京。这时，我六十名革命学生在车内高呼革命口号，高举《毛主席语录》，与送行的同志们告别。
