Albanian and Chinese Comrades Will Forever March Side by Side
The Albanian "Labor Daily" Praises the Revolutionary Unity of the Two Countries' Working Class

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 25th, the Albanian "Labor Daily" published an editorial on the 24th stating that the Albanian working class, with a lofty spirit of proletarian internationalism, warmly congratulates the Shanghai proletarian brothers on their victory in smashing the evil plots of counter-revolutionary revisionists.

The article states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is developing smoothly in depth. The heroic Chinese working class, holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is strengthening unity and pushing the Cultural Revolution to a new high tide. The revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong is inspiring the broad masses of Chinese laborers.

The article states that the Albanian working class, in many letters, firmly supports the revolutionary actions of Shanghai and the revolutionary workers across China in opposing the bourgeois reactionary line of a handful of revisionists and conspirators. This is another powerful manifestation of proletarian internationalism and the strong unity between the Albanian working class and the Chinese working class. The article concludes by pointing out that although the peoples of Albania and China are geographically distant, the struggle for revolutionary causes and socialist construction, the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, and the struggle against modern revisionism centered around the traitorous leadership of the CPSU, have closely united our two peoples. Under the leadership of the two Marxist-Leninist parties headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong, the working classes of Albania and China will forever march side by side on the revolutionary road and on the great path to socialism and communism.

　　阿中两国战友永远并肩前进
　　阿尔巴尼亚《劳动报》颂扬两国工人阶级的革命团结
    据新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《劳动报》二十四日发表编辑部文章说，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级以崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神，热烈祝贺上海阶级兄弟在粉碎反革命修正主义分子的罪恶阴谋中取得的胜利。
    文章说，由毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命正在顺利地向纵深方向发展。英雄的中国工人阶级高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，正在加强团结，把文化大革命推向一个新的高潮。以毛泽东同志为代表的革命路线正在鼓舞着中国广大的劳动群众。
    文章说，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级在许多信件中，对上海以及全中国革命工人反对一小撮修正主义者和阴谋家的资产阶级反动路线的革命行动，表示坚决的支持。这是无产阶级国际主义和我国工人阶级同中国工人阶级坚强团结的又一有力表现。文章最后指出，阿中两国人民虽然在地理上相距很远，但是，革命事业和社会主义建设事业的斗争、反对以美国为首的帝国主义和反对以苏共叛徒领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，把我们两国人民紧密地联合在一起。阿中两国工人阶级在以恩维尔·霍查同志和毛泽东同志为首的两个马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，在革命的道路上，在向社会主义和共产主义的大道上，将永远并肩前进。
