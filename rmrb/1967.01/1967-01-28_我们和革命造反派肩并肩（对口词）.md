	Our great teacher Chairman Mao has issued a new battle cry!
	The proletarian revolutionary factions unite!
	Overthrow the capitalist roaders in power!
	Seize the power from their hands,
	Knock off their official hats!
	Kick them to the ground,
	And stomp on them with both feet!
	This is the proletarian counterattack,
	This is a new leap in the Cultural Revolution!
	We revolutionary soldiers
	Cannot suppress our inner joy,
	We shout with all our hearts: Good! Good! Good!
	The revolutionary vanguard,
	Our close comrades,
	We stand by your side,
	With our rifles firmly in hand.
	Our pledge is:
	To remember Chairman Mao's teachings,
	To support you a thousand times!
	To support you ten thousand times!
	To always stand by your side.
	The People's Liberation Army,
	Created by Chairman Mao himself,
	Following Chairman Mao, we defeated the Japanese invaders;
	Following Chairman Mao, we buried the Chiang Kai-shek regime;
	Following Chairman Mao, we made the American imperialists howl in pain;
	Following Chairman Mao, we march towards the path of communism!
	But,
	The capitalist representatives who have infiltrated the Party
	Are unwilling to see the end of the exploitative system.
	They block the wheels of history,
	Trying to reverse course,
	Attempting to cover China again with the black curtain of capitalism.
	Pah! Foolish dream! Impossible!
	The People's Liberation Army,
	Is the tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat,
	And stands firmly with the proletarian revolutionary factions.
	To defend Mao Zedong Thought,
	We are willing to shed our blood and sacrifice our heads!
	The revolutionary vanguard,
	Our close comrades,
	We must be a hundred times vigilant,
	We are fully prepared.
	No matter how frenzied the class enemies are,
	No matter what tricks they use,
	As long as they do not surrender,
	We will, together with you,
	Firmly, thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate them!
	We will let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought
	Fly high in the sky,
	Let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought
	Shine upon the entire globe!
