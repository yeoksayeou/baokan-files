The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry warned the Thai reactionary regime that if it stubbornly follows the U.S. imperialists in invading Vietnam, it will surely be punished. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stated that it will give a resolute counterattack.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 10th: The Press Bureau of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Foreign Ministry held a press conference in the afternoon of the 10th, releasing a statement from the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry strongly condemning the Thai reactionary regime's plot to send an additional 1,000 mercenaries to South Vietnam.

The statement pointed out that the Thanom reactionary ruling clique in Thailand actively participates in the U.S. aggression against Vietnam, allowing U.S. aggressors to launch aircraft from Thailand to bomb the liberated areas of North and South Vietnam and Laos, sending troops and pilots to South Vietnam, plotting to let the U.S. move B-52 strategic bombers to Thailand, and recently plotting to send an additional 1,000 Thai mercenaries to South Vietnam.

The statement warns the Thai authorities that if they persist in following the U.S. aggressors, opposing the Vietnamese people and the peoples of the Indochina countries, and disrupting peace in Southeast Asia, they will surely suffer the deserved punishment and must bear full responsibility for all consequences resulting from their evil actions.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 11th: The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam reported that the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's External Relations Commission issued a statement on the 9th, pointing out that if the Thai authorities continue to betray the interests of the Thai people, allowing the U.S. to use Thailand as a base to bomb Vietnam, and sending additional Thai mercenaries to participate in the U.S. aggression against South Vietnam, the people of South Vietnam will surely exercise their legitimate right to self-defense and take necessary measures to give a resolute counterattack.
