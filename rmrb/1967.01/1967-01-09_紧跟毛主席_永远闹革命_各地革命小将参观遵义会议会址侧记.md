The historic Zunyi Conference, which holds great significance, has been thirty-two years since it took place this January. The site of the Zunyi Conference, a shining milestone in the history of the Chinese revolution, has strongly attracted the hearts of countless revolutionaries since the establishment of the memorial hall. In the midst of the Cultural Revolution, the young Red Guards, who have vowed to follow Chairman Mao closely and make revolution forever, formed the Long March teams. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they followed in the footsteps of the revolutionary forerunners, filled with boundless love and reverence for our great leader Chairman Mao, and came to Zunyi.

Many revolutionary youngsters mentioned: The Zunyi Conference is an important meeting that established the leadership of our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao in the entire Party. It was a great turning point that successfully ended the rule of "left" opportunism within the Party, turning the Chinese revolution from crisis to stability. This meeting marked the beginning of the new leadership of the Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, a historic change within the Party.

"Learn from the great leader Chairman Mao!" is the lifelong aspiration of the broad revolutionary youth. It is with this purpose that they came to Zunyi, and with this attitude that they visited the site of the Zunyi Conference.

Many revolutionary youngsters, upon arriving in Zunyi, whether it was daytime, midnight, or in the early morning with frost on the ground, they could go without food or sleep. The first thing they did was to rush to the site to pay their respects to the revolutionary relics. Some Long March teams stayed in Zunyi for only two or three days, but they visited the site four or five times. Some revolutionary youngsters, after visiting during the day, still requested permission to visit alone after the museum closed, asking the guide to give them a detailed introduction. The youngsters said, "This place is a classroom for learning the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We want to see and hear enough, to draw endless revolutionary strength from here."

The revolutionary youngsters of the Long March teams, before visiting, collectively read Chairman Mao's relevant works, such as "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "On the Tactics Against Japanese Imperialism," and so on. During the visit, they listened attentively and took careful notes of the guide's introduction, copying relevant texts and explanations. After the visit, the youngsters had serious discussions, wrote their reflections, and published mimeographed special editions. These youngsters deeply felt that although the site of the Zunyi Conference is just a two-story building, it contains extremely profound and rich revolutionary truths. It vividly embodies our great leader Chairman Mao's consistent correctness, wisdom, and greatness in leading the Chinese revolution. It is the best classroom for learning Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Especially at this time when the proletarian cultural revolution has entered a new stage, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved great victories, and the broad revolutionary masses are launching a total attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters in society with irresistible momentum, it is of great practical significance to revisit this history, learn from it, and deepen our understanding of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The revolutionary youngsters paid special attention to the cultural relics and historical materials related to the line struggle. It was from these relics and materials that the revolutionary youngsters deepened their understanding and appreciation of the great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and developed boundless love, admiration, and reverence for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. They also further understood Comrade Lin Biao's teaching: Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time.

Two Long March teams from military academies held a symposium here. The cadets said at the meeting: Whether before or after the Zunyi Conference, Chairman Mao was always the most correct, the most wise, and the most great. Even if we use the most beautiful words in the world, we cannot express his great wisdom. This is the common feeling of many revolutionary youngsters after visiting the site of the Zunyi Conference.

A revolutionary youngster from a middle school in Yunnan Province wrote in the visitor's book: After visiting the site of the Zunyi Conference, I came to a conclusion: Only by firmly carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can we make the Chinese revolution advance from one victory to another new victory. A Red Guard from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region also wrote in the visitor's book: A thousand words, ten thousand words, cannot express the greatness of the Zunyi Conference, and songs cannot sing enough of Chairman Mao's wisdom. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your faithful little red soldier swears to you: We will forever be loyal to you, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to the great Party, loyal to the people. Even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble, we will not change our hearts. A Long March team from Chongqing, after visiting the site, immediately printed a special edition in the dead of night, with titles such as "Red Heart Forever Towards the Red Sun," "Defend Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line to the Death," and "New Starting Point," expressing their great aspirations to forever follow Chairman Mao and be revolutionary successors, and their determination to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line even if they have to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire.

Members of a Long March team from Central China were deeply moved after visiting the site and immediately took an oath in front of Chairman Mao's statue. They also made a banner that read: "Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!" Some revolutionary youngsters from Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and other ethnic minority regions were even more stirred after visiting the site. Some immediately wrote letters to share their feelings with comrades far away, while others sang together loudly, using their high-spirited songs to express their boundless love for the great leader. A Uyghur Red Guard from the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains sang: With tall poplars as pens, with surging rivers as ink, and with vast lands as paper, seven hundred million people all pick up their pens to write, write, write! They can never write enough about Chairman Mao's wisdom and greatness, nor can they write enough about Chairman Mao's deep kindness and affection....

There are also many, many revolutionary youngsters whose love for the great leader Chairman Mao is beyond words. Several members of a Long March team from Henan Province, after visiting the site and Chairman Mao's residence, felt that no words could express their love for Chairman Mao. So, in the dead of night, they carried water and mops, barefoot, to clean Chairman Mao's former living quarters. After cleaning the entire room, they were afraid of leaving footprints, so they knelt down and wiped the floor as they retreated, step by step, out of the room. In Chairman Mao's residence, Red Army Mountain, and other places, they planted thousands of green pines and cypresses. Originally, this was a proposal made by a group of revolutionary youngsters from Beijing, and within three days, more than four hundred schools and over two thousand revolutionary youngsters personally planted them. Many youngsters hung bamboo signs on the trees that read, "Planted by Chairman Mao's little red soldiers," "Planted by revolutionary successors." A youngster from Guiyang also wrote on a bamboo sign: "Little pines, please carry our boundless love for Chairman Mao and grow quickly!"

A thousand words, ten thousand words, express the common wish of the young revolutionary generation: Follow Chairman Mao closely and make revolution forever!

    紧跟毛主席　永远闹革命
    ——各地革命小将参观遵义会议会址侧记
    具有伟大历史意义的遵义会议，到今年一月整整三十二年了。遵义会议会址这个在中国革命史上闪闪发光的史迹，自建立纪念馆以来，强烈地吸引着千千万万革命者的心。在文化大革命高潮中，誓愿紧跟毛主席永远闹革命的红卫兵小将们组成的长征队，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，踏着革命先辈走过的脚印，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和崇敬的感情，来到遵义。
    不少革命小将谈到：遵义会议是确立我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席在全党的领导地位的重要会议，是胜利地结束了“左”倾机会主义在党内的统治，使中国革命转危为安的伟大转折点。这次会议开始了以毛泽东同志为首的中央的新的领导，是中国党内具有历史意义的转变。
    “向伟大的领袖毛主席学习！”是广大革命青少年毕生的宏愿。他们，正是抱着这样的目的来到遵义，抱着这样的态度，参观遵义会议会址的。
    许多革命小将一到遵义，无论是在白天，深夜，或是在寒霜盖地的清晨，他们饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，第一件事，就是直奔会址瞻仰革命史迹。有的长征队，在遵义只停留三两天，但参观会址却不下四五次。有的革命小将，白天参观了，闭馆后仍要求允许他们单独参观，请解说员给他们作详详细细的介绍。小将们说，这里是学习战无不胜的毛泽东思想的课堂，他们要看够、听够，要从这里汲取无穷无尽的革命力量。
    长征队的革命小将们，在参观前集体选读毛主席的有关著作，如《中国革命战争的战略问题》、《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》等等。参观时，他们非常专心听、仔细记解说员的介绍，摘抄有关的文字资料、说明。参观后，小将们认真进行座谈、讨论，写心得，出版油印专刊。这些小将深有所感地说：遵义会议会址虽然只有一幢两层楼的楼房，但在这里却蕴藏着极为深刻极为丰富的革命真理，它生动地体现出我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在领导中国革命中一贯正确、英明、伟大，它是学习毛主席革命路线的一个最好的大课堂。特别在当前无产阶级文化大革命发展到一个新阶段的时候，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线已经取得了伟大的胜利，广大革命群众正以雷霆万钧之势，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，展开总攻击的时候，来重温这段历史，学习这段历史，加深对毛主席革命路线的理解，更有非常重要的现实意义。
    革命小将们对有关路线斗争的文物、史料，特别认真，特别仔细，特别感兴趣。革命小将们正是从这些文物、史料中，加深了对伟大领袖毛主席革命路线的认识和理解，对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席产生了无限热爱，无限崇拜，无限敬仰的深厚感情，也更进一步体会了林彪同志的教导：毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。
    来自军事院校的两支长征队，在这里举行了座谈会。学员们在会上说：毛主席无论在遵义会议前或会议后，都是最正确、最英明、最伟大的，我们就是用尽了天下最美好的言词，也不能表达出他老人家的英明伟大。这是许多革命小将参观遵义会议会址后的共同感受。
    云南省一所中学的一个革命小将在留言簿上写道：参观了遵义会议会址，得出一个结论：只有坚决执行毛主席的革命路线，才能使中国的革命从一个胜利走向另一个新的胜利。广西壮族自治区的一个红卫兵也在留言簿上写道：千句话，万句话，道不尽遵义会议的伟大，歌不尽毛主席的英明。毛主席啊毛主席！您的忠实的红小兵向您宣誓：我们永远忠于您，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于伟大的党，忠于人民。那怕海枯石烂也不变心。重庆的一支长征队在参观会址后，立即在深夜赶印出了专刊，用“红心永向红太阳”、“誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线”、“更新的起点”等为题，抒发了他们永远跟着毛主席，誓做革命接班人的豪情壮志，表达了他们上刀山，入火海，也要保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的决心。
    来自华中的一支长征队的队员们参观会址后心情万分激动，立即在毛主席的塑像前宣誓，又赶制了一面锦旗，上面写着：“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利万岁！”还有一些来自内蒙古、新疆等兄弟民族地区的革命小将，参观会址后更是心潮澎湃，有的马上写信，把自己的感受告诉远方的同志，有的放声齐唱，用高昂的歌声来表达自己对伟大领袖无限热爱的心情。一位来自天山脚下的维吾尔族红卫兵唱道：以高大的白杨为笔，以滔滔的江水作墨，以辽阔的土地当纸，七亿人民都拿起笔来，写呀！写呀写！也写不尽毛主席的英明伟大，也写不尽毛主席的深恩厚情。……
    还有许许多多的革命小将，他们对伟大领袖毛主席的爱戴，远非笔墨所能形容。河南省的几名长征队员，在参观会址和毛主席的住地后，觉得千言万语也表达不尽他们对毛主席的热爱，便在夜深人静的时候，提着水，带着拖把，赤着脚，去擦洗毛主席当年的住室。整个房间打扫后，他们唯恐留下脚印，又跪着一步一步地边擦边退，退出房间。在毛主席的住地、红军山等地，种上了数千株青松翠柏。原来，这是来自北京的一批革命小将发出倡议后三天内，四百多所大中学校的两千多名革命小将亲手种下的。许多小将在树上挂了“毛主席的红小兵种”、“革命接班人种”的竹牌。贵阳的一位小将还在竹牌上写道：“小松树，请带着我们对毛主席无限热爱的心情，快快成长吧！”
    千句话，万句话，道出了年青的革命一代的共同心愿：紧跟毛主席，永远闹革命！新华社记者
