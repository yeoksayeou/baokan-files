The United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain are jointly plotting a new conspiracy for "peace talks." Britain advocates for "immediate meetings," and Johnson immediately applauds. Kosygin is about to visit Britain.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 4th, a farce titled "Bombing to Force Peace" and "Stopping Bombing to Lure Peace," meticulously planned by the Johnson administration of the United States around its war of aggression in Vietnam, is continuing to be performed with drums and gongs. In this farce, the Soviet revisionist leadership, the British Labour government, and UN Secretary-General U Thant play the shameful roles of the main accomplices.

Recently, U.S. imperialism has intensified its bombing of North and South Vietnam while playing tricks with the "Christmas ceasefire" and the "New Year ceasefire," making various attempts to probe for "peace talks" and plotting "peace talk" traps. In coordination with these U.S. conspiracies, British Foreign Secretary George Brown sent an urgent telegram on December 30 to the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and the so-called "Foreign Minister" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, proposing that the three parties appoint representatives to "meet immediately to arrange for the cessation of hostilities." Brown's telegram also stated that to realize this British proposal, it is willing to provide the necessary facilities in Hong Kong or at an appropriate location in British territory and arrange for the transmission of necessary letters among the relevant parties to arrange for this meeting.

As soon as Brown's proposal was made, it immediately received praise from U.S. imperialism. Johnson, who was vacationing at his ranch in Texas, hurriedly held a press conference on December 31 to "express gratitude" for Brown's proposal. The Johnson, who was in a state of panic due to the Vietnam War, also claimed that the United States is "extremely willing to meet at any time and any place, as long as Hanoi is willing to come to the negotiating table."

What is particularly outrageous is that the British Labour government, in order to better serve the U.S. imperialist conspiracy of "bombing to force peace," actually proposed Hong Kong as a possible venue for "peace talks." Everyone knows that the British Labour government has allowed U.S. imperialism to intensify the use of Hong Kong as a military base for aggression against Vietnam, allowing a large number of U.S. warships to frequently enter and exit Hong Kong, which has already exposed the British government's role as an accomplice to the United States in front of the world's people; now Brown dares to publicly propose to provide Hong Kong to the United States as a stage for the peace talk farce. This not only further exposes the British Labour government's complete servility but also reflects its utter stupidity and arrogance in the face of 700 million great Chinese people.

Brown's proposal was also made just after the British government formally announced that Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin would visit Britain in February to discuss Vietnam and other issues with the British government. It is reported that while proposing his suggestion, Brown also wrote a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, asking him to "instruct the three relevant governments to send representatives to participate in the talks" with the prestige and influence of the Soviet government.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has been actively working to serve the U.S. imperialist conspiracies of "bombing to force peace" and "stopping bombing to lure peace." While sending a large number of leaders to engage in various covert and overt conspiracies, it also hinted to Britain that the United States should carry out the "stop bombing" conspiracy, so that the Soviet Union's influence in promoting "peace talks" could be increased. The words and deeds of the Soviet revisionist leadership show that it is an active shareholder in the imperialist and reactionary companies that are strangling the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle.

At the same time, UN Secretary-General U Thant, who has been "encouraged from all sides" by the United States, replied on December 31 to a letter from U.S. representative Arthur Goldberg on December 19, asking him to help the United States realize its "peace talk" conspiracy. In his reply, U Thant reiterated his proposal for a "ceasefire" and a "gradual reduction of military operations," and advocated for an "extension of the New Year ceasefire" to promote the U.S. "peace talk" scam. He expressed his willingness to "make every effort" to serve the U.S. "peace talk" conspiracy. Goldberg immediately welcomed U Thant's reply. He asked U Thant to use "all the methods he can" to determine what specific response North Vietnam would make after the United States took the first step.

All the above facts show that a major conspiracy to strangle the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is being actively carried out by the combined efforts of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. While U.S. imperialism colludes with the Soviet revisionist leadership and reactionary forces of various countries to hatch "peace talk" conspiracies, it is also continuing to exert military pressure and war blackmail on the Vietnamese people. On December 31, the U.S. troops in Vietnam increased by another 4,000. At his year-end press conference, Johnson shouted, "The war in Vietnam will continue, and the U.S. troops there will receive all the necessary support." He "does not want to tie the hands of U.S. soldiers."

The U.S. imperialists' intensified promotion of the "peace talk" scam and desperate implementation of war blackmail fully demonstrate the truth pointed out by Chairman Mao: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their final struggles against the revolutionary forces."

The U.S. imperialists' desperate promotion of the "peace talk" scam and war blackmail shows that they have reached a dead end in the Vietnam War, fully exposing their weak essence. No matter how they struggle, they will inevitably face complete failure in the face of the resolute resistance of the Vietnamese people.

### 牛鬼蛇神齐登场　紧锣密鼓演丑剧  美苏英合伙策划“和谈”新阴谋  英国鼓吹“立即开会”约翰逊马上喝彩　柯西金即将访英

    牛鬼蛇神齐登场　紧锣密鼓演丑剧
    美苏英合伙策划“和谈”新阴谋
    英国鼓吹“立即开会”约翰逊马上喝彩　柯西金即将访英
    据新华社四日讯　由美国约翰逊政府围绕着它侵略越南的战争而精心策划的一出“以炸迫和”和“停炸诱和”的丑剧，正在紧锣密鼓地继续上演。在这出丑剧中，苏联修正主义领导集团、英国工党政府和联合国秘书长吴丹，扮演着可耻的主要帮凶的角色。
    美帝国主义最近在加紧对越南北方和南方狂轰滥炸同时，大事玩弄圣诞
  “停火”和新年“停火”阴谋，四出进行“和谈”试探，策划“和谈”圈套。同美国的这些阴谋紧密配合，英国外交大臣布朗在去年十二月三十日向越南民主共和国外交部长、美国国务卿腊斯克和南越卖国集团的所谓“外交部长”，发出紧急电报，要求三方指派代表“立即开会，安排停止敌对行动”。布朗的电报还说，为了实现英国这一主张，它愿意在香港或英国领土上适当地点“提供相应的设备，并安排为有关各方传递必要的信件，以安排这次会议”。
    布朗的建议刚一出笼，就立即得到美帝国主义的喝彩。正在得克萨斯州牧场度假的约翰逊，急忙于十二月三十一日举行记者招待会，对布朗的建议
  “表示感谢”。被侵越战争弄得焦头烂额的约翰逊还声称，美国“极其愿意在任何时候和任何地方开会，只要河内愿意到会议桌旁来。”
    尤其令人愤慨的是，英国工党政府为了更好地替美帝国主义“以炸迫和”的阴谋活动效劳，竟然提出以香港作为可能的“和谈”地点。人们都知道，英国工党政府纵容美帝国主义加紧利用香港作为侵略越南的军事活动基地，让大批美国军舰不断出入香港活动，这早已经使英国政府充当美国帮凶的面目暴露在世界人民面前；现在布朗竟敢公然提出要把香港提供美国作为和谈丑剧的舞台，这不但进一步暴露了英国工党政府的十足奴才相，而且反映了它在七亿伟大中国人民面前的十足愚蠢和不自量。
    布朗的建议也是在英国政府刚刚正式宣布苏联部长会议主席柯西金将于今年二月访问英国，同英国政府主要讨论越南等问题之后提出的。据报道，布朗在提出他的建议的同时，还写信给苏联外交部长葛罗米柯，要他“以苏联政府的地位和威望，要求三个有关政府派代表参加会谈”。
    苏联修正主义领导集团一直卖力地为美帝国主义“以炸迫和”和“停炸诱和”的阴谋奔走效劳。它在最近派出大批领导人，四出进行明里、暗里的各种阴谋活动的同时，还向英国暗示要美国搞“停炸”阴谋，以便使苏联促成“和谈”的“影响”可能增加。苏联修正主义领导集团的言行表明，它完全是帝国主义和各种反动派扼杀越南人民革命斗争的合股公司的一个积极的股东。
    在这同时，一直得到美国“从各方面鼓励”的联合国秘书长吴丹，在十二月三十一日答复了美国代表戈德堡十二月十九日要他帮助美国实现“和谈”阴谋的信。吴丹在复信里重申了他的“停炸”和使军事行动“逐步降级”的主张，并鼓吹“延长新年停火”，以图促进美国的“和谈”骗局。他表示要“尽最大的努力”为美国的“和谈”阴谋效劳。吴丹的复信立即受到戈德堡的欢迎。他要吴丹利用他“所能利用的一切方法来断定在美国先采取了……步骤以后，北越会作出什么样的具体反应”。
    所有以上这一切事实说明，由帝、修、反合力策划的一个扼杀越南人民抗美救国斗争事业的大阴谋，正在积极进行中。美帝国主义一面勾结苏联修正主义领导集团和各国反动派策动“和谈”阴谋，一面正在继续对越南人民施加军事压力和战争讹诈。侵越美军在十二月三十一日又增加了四千人。约翰逊在他的年终记者招待会上叫嚷，“越南的战争活动将继续下去，那里的美军将获得一切必要的支持”。他“不愿意束缚美国兵的手脚”。
    美帝国主义加紧玩弄“和谈”骗局和拚命推行战争讹诈，充分说明了毛主席所指出的一个真理：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。
    美帝国主义现在拚命来推行“和谈”骗局和战争讹诈，说明它在侵越战争中已经到了山穷水尽的地步，充分暴露了它的虚弱的本质。不管它怎样进行最后挣扎，在坚决抗战的越南人民面前，都是逃脱不了彻底失败的命运的。
