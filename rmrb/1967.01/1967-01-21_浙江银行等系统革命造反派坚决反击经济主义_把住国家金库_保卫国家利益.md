Revolutionary rebels in the banking system of Zhejiang, together with revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses from other sectors, have taken control of the state treasury to ensure that the state's financial affairs are not disrupted.

In the new situation where Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has achieved great victories, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have used economism to deceive the masses, inciting them to disrupt production, disrupt financial affairs, and disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. For example, a small clique within the Shaoxing County Committee actually used economic bribery to cater to the psychology of a few individuals, adopting methods such as issuing back pay, increasing allowances, improving welfare, and compensating for the use of commune members' labor for construction projects, misusing state funds. By December 28 last year, the total amount had reached five or six hundred thousand yuan. Even more seriously, the Huazhou County Committee dared, after our great leader Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and "Urgent Notice" from various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai to the entire country, to openly approve the issuance of so-called migrant funds totaling 620,000 yuan. A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the bank also used the tactic of "paying on sight, paying until it's gone" to disrupt the state's financial affairs. In recent days, revolutionary rebels from the banking system across the province, together with revolutionary rebels from other sectors, have resolutely opposed economism. Revolutionary cadres from the Shaoxing County Branch of the People's Bank have stepped forward and have already refused to pay over 100 million yuan in expenditures that do not comply with state regulations, guarding the state treasury. Revolutionary cadres from many regional banks have also actively propagated the "Urgent Notice" from revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and Zhejiang Province, powerfully exposing the new conspiracies of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line.

　　浙江银行等系统革命造反派坚决反击经济主义
　　把住国家金库　保卫国家利益
    新华社杭州二十日电　浙江省银行系统的革命造反派，联合其他方面的革命造反派和革命群众，把住国家金库的口子，确保国家金融事业不受破坏。
    浙江省委和浙江省各地一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派与极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，在毛主席的革命路线取得伟大胜利的新形势下，采用经济主义来欺骗群众，煽动群众破坏生产，破坏财政金融，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。例如绍兴县委内的一小撮人，竟用经济收买的手段，迎合少数群众的心理，采用补发工资、提高津贴、增加福利、补退过去调用社员劳动力进行基本建设的工资等方式，滥用国家资金，到去年十二月二十八日止，总金额已达五、六十万元。更为严重的是，开化县委竟敢在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定向全国广播上海各革命造反组织的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》以后，还公然由县委内一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人批准补发了所谓移民经费六十二万元。银行内一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，也采用“见票即付，付光算数”的手段，破坏国家的财政金融。近日来，全省银行系统的革命造反派联合其他方面的革命造反派，坚决反对经济主义。绍兴县人民银行的革命干部挺身而出，已经拒绝支付一百多万元不符合国家规定的支出，把住了国家金库的口子。许多地区银行的革命干部，还积极宣传上海市和浙江省各革命造反派的《紧急通告》，有力地揭露了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的新阴谋。
