Recently, the soldiers of a certain unit's "Hero Eighth Company" discussed their experiences in executing the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" during their field exercises, training, production, and their recent reception of Red Guards. With deep affection for the great leader Chairman Mao, they shared their insights from the past two years. They vividly and abundantly demonstrated that the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," personally formulated by Chairman Mao, are the treasured principles for the people's army to unite internally, unite with the masses, promote the revolutionization of the army's ideology, and strengthen the army's combat effectiveness. By strictly adhering to the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," they can genuinely achieve unity between the military and the people, between officers and soldiers, maintain the character of the people's army, and successfully complete all tasks. They said: With Chairman Mao's personally formulated "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," wherever we go, we execute them there, and we bring the good style and tradition of the army there. The process of implementing the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" is the process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, serving the people wholeheartedly, and promoting Mao Zedong Thought. By resolutely acting according to the supreme commander's directive, we can forever be united with the people, forever be models in executing the party's line and policies, and forever stand unyielding.

    坚决按照最高统帅的命令行动
    某部“英雄八连”座谈执行“三大纪律八项注意”的体会
    最近，某部“英雄八连”的指战员，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限亲切的感情，畅谈了近两年来在野营行军、训练、生产以及不久前接待红卫兵等工作中，坚决执行毛主席亲手制订的“三大纪律八项注意”的体会。他们以生动、丰富的事实，雄辩地证明：“三大纪律八项注意”是人民军队团结内部、团结群众、促进部队思想革命化、加强部队战斗力的传家宝。贯彻执行“三大纪律八项注意”，就能切实做到军民一致，官兵一致，保持人民军队的本色，胜利完成各项任务。他们说：有了毛主席亲自制订的“三大纪律八项注意”，我们走到那里，执行到那里，就能把军队的好作风、好传统带到那里；贯彻执行“三大纪律八项注意”的过程，就是活学活用毛主席著作的过程，全心全意为人民服务的过程，宣传毛泽东思想的过程。坚决按照我们伟大统帅的这一最高指示行动，我们就能永远和人民打成一片，永远成为执行党的路线、政策的模范，永远立于不败之地。
