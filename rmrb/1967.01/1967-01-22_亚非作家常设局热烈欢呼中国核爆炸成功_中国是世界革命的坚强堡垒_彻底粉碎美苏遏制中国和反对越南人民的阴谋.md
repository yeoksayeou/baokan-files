The Afro-Asian Writers' Association recently issued a statement warmly celebrating China's latest successful nuclear explosion as a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The statement pointed out that this victory has strengthened the struggle of all the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism.

The statement pointed out that China has successfully conducted three nuclear tests in the past year, which is a heavy blow to the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership. The evil invasion plans of U.S. imperialism and its number one accomplice, Soviet modern revisionism, to contain China and use nuclear blackmail to oppose the people of the world, especially the heroic people of Vietnam, are increasingly suffering more complete failure and more thorough smashing.

The statement said that the great achievements China has made prove the victory and achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is now being carried out vigorously. This is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought, which proves that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes an immense and invincible great material force. As long as Mao Zedong Thought is used as a weapon, any task can be accomplished. It once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is not only a powerful weapon for all the people of the world to defeat imperialists, colonialists, all reactionaries, and modern revisionists and their followers, but also a powerful weapon for developing the national economy, building socialism, and achieving scientific and technological progress.

The statement said that China's victory in the field of nuclear weapons is a great encouragement and support to the people who are fighting for national liberation and to the people who are building socialism. China's victories have always been regarded by the people of the world as their own victories. Because they believe that China and its 700 million people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest, most reliable, and most solid bulwark of the world revolution. The stronger the People's Republic of China becomes, the stronger the cause of the people of the world fighting for national liberation will be.

The statement finally said that the Afro-Asian writers hope that the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, will achieve greater successes in all fields, especially in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is currently being carried out.

　　亚非作家常设局热烈欢呼中国核爆炸成功
　　中国是世界革命的坚强堡垒
　　彻底粉碎美苏遏制中国和反对越南人民的阴谋
    新华社二十一日讯　亚非作家常设局最近发表声明，热烈欢呼中国新的核爆炸成功是毛泽东思想的新胜利，指出这个胜利加强了全世界人民反对美帝国主义和反对苏联现代修正主义的斗争。
    声明指出，中国在过去一年内成功地进行了三次核试验，是对以美国为首的帝国主义者和以苏共修正主义领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者的沉重打击。美帝国主义者和它的头号帮凶苏联现代修正主义者，遏制中国和进行核讹诈来反对世界人民特别是反对英雄的越南人民的罪恶侵略计划，越来越遭到更加完全的失败和更加彻底的粉碎。
    声明说，中国所取得的伟大成就，证明了正在轰轰烈烈地进行的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利和成就。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，它证明了毛泽东思想一旦掌握群众就成为无穷的不可战胜的伟大的物质力量。只要用毛泽东思想作为武器，任何事情就一定能取得成功。它再一次证明了毛泽东思想不仅是全世界人民打败帝国主义者、殖民主义者、一切反动派和现代修正主义者及其追随者们的强大武器，而且也是发展民族经济，建设社会主义和获取科学技术发展的强大武器。
    声明说，中国在核武器方面的胜利是对正在为民族解放而斗争的人民和正在建设社会主义的人民的极大鼓舞与支持。中国的胜利向来被世界人民看作是他们自己的胜利。因为他们认为中国及其在毛泽东思想指导下的七亿人民是最伟大、最可以信赖和最坚固的世界革命的堡垒。中华人民共和国愈是强大，世界人民为民族解放而进行的斗争事业也就更加强大。
    声明最后说，亚非作家希望中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在各方面特别是在正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命中取得更大的成就。
