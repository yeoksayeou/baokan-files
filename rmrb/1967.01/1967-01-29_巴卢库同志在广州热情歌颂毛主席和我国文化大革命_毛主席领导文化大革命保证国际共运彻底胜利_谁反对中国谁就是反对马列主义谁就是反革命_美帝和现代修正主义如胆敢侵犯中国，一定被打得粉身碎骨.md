Albanian Labor Party Central Committee Politburo member, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, and head of the Albanian military delegation, Bekir Baluku, on January 27, delivered a lengthy, enthusiastic speech at a farewell banquet hosted by the Guangzhou military authorities.

Comrade Baluku highly praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "During our stay in your country, we have personally and vividly experienced the unprecedented political and ideological revolution—the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—that the entire revolutionary people, revolutionary students and teachers, the working class, and revolutionary cadres are undergoing. We are very pleased to see that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is being widely and deeply carried out. Here and throughout the country, political and ideological fervor is on the rise, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has become a mass movement. You are marching towards victory."

Comrade Baluku recounted the great class struggles that the Chinese people have undergone under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, defeating the Japanese imperialists, the Kuomintang bandits, and the American imperialist invaders, and achieving revolutionary victories. He said, "Today, after achieving victory, the Chinese people are carrying out a magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great cause undertaken by the heroic Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and it has great historical significance, marking a new stage in the history of China and the Chinese people. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, your industry is making rapid progress, socialist construction in the countryside is developing rapidly, and a new socialist culture is flourishing. All these great victories and achievements are the results of the revolutionary people under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China. They are the victories of the brilliant thoughts and theories of Marxism-Leninism by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist and dear friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong. They are the brilliant victories of combining the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese revolutionary practice. The Chinese people, the Chinese working class, and all laboring people are united like steel around the Party and the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people are traversing a path that no one has ever walked before. The Chinese people have great love and faith in the Party and Chairman Mao, and they resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's teachings without the slightest hesitation. No force, whether domestic or foreign, can shake the Chinese people's confidence in victory under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao. The Chinese people's Cultural Revolution marks a major historical stage in China, playing a tremendous role in promoting the international workers' movement and the communist movement. It defends and consolidates the cause of proletarian revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong plays a significant role in ensuring the thorough victory of the Chinese and international communist and workers' movements. This revolution is a contribution to the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism. The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists and their accomplices are extremely hostile to your Cultural Revolution. Because this revolution has completely dashed their hopes. Their hope was to one day carry out a counter-revolutionary coup against China and Albania in the realm of political ideology, but their plans have been completely dashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." Comrade Baluku emphasized, "The Albanian Labor Party supports the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and defends it. This is to defend ourselves and safeguard our own cause."

Comrade Baluku, in his speech, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war. He said, "We have seen your glorious militias and the determination of men, women, and the elderly here to defend the motherland, defend the revolution, and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. In your country, in Guangzhou, and in any place, everyone is a soldier. We are deeply convinced that if there is such a madman or military adventurer like U.S. imperialism or modern revisionism who dares to invade China, then here it will be impossible to distinguish between the front and the rear. All of China will rise up as one to deliver a devastating blow to the invaders and enemies, crushing them to smithereens so that they can never rise again." Comrade Baluku praised, "You have well applied Comrade Mao Zedong's military thoughts and people's war thoughts. Which capitalist country, which revisionist country, dares to give weapons to the people? None. They are all afraid of the people, but only you give weapons to the people, making the people truly grasp the destiny of the revolution and the motherland. This is a profound Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. We in Albania are also like this. We also have militias. Our Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha's slogan is: 'Stay vigilant, grasp weapons, prepare to defend the revolution!' From seven-year-olds to seventy-year-olds, everyone is armed to defend the Party's cause. Our militias and people's army learn from the Party and Comrade Hoxha's teachings, learn from the experiences of the Chinese militias and Chinese army, and learn and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's military works and military thoughts. If the enemy launches an invasion, we will also fight a people's war, drowning the invaders in the vast ocean of people's war."

Comrade Baluku, in his speech, expressed revolutionary fervor in praising the combat friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania. He said, "As soon as we arrived at the unit, the soldiers rushed up and surrounded the friends, and surrounded us several times. These encirclements are expressions of deep fraternal friendship, showing that our friendship is deep-rooted. You and we understand each other. Our friendship is a complete people's friendship, a combat and revolutionary friendship. This friendship is eternal, and no force can destroy this friendship. Because this friendship is created by the parties of our two countries, by our two great leaders, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha. Our friendship is built on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and this friendship will last as long as the world exists. We will forever advance together, inseparable. Our friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests, and is a pure friendship between peoples, an internationalist friendship. Our enemies are extremely jealous and afraid of our internationalist friendship and cooperation. Our two parties, on the road of revolution, on the road of defending Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, march shoulder to shoulder, unshakably. Comrade Baluku said, "Today, the flag of Marxism-Leninism is flying over Tiananmen Square, and is in the hands of the glorious Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong. Today's China and the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong have become the backbone of the world workers' movement and the communist movement. Whoever opposes China is opposing Marxism-Leninism, is a counter-revolutionary, and a revisionist; whoever defends China is defending the proletarian revolution, defending Marxism-Leninism. This is an objective fact of Marxism-Leninism. We are proud to be friends, comrades, and brothers with you. Comrade Baluku said, "Those who stand on a wavering position will one day fall into the quagmire of opportunism or revisionism. This is inevitable. Either stand with us or oppose us, there are only these two paths. Comrade Baluku said, "But the people are on our side. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, more than ninety-five percent of the people are on our side. The proletarians are on our side, the revolutionaries are on our side, the oppressed peoples are on our side, the Marxist-Leninists are on our side. Therefore, victory is ours, this is undeniable. We will definitely win!"

    巴卢库同志在广州热情歌颂毛主席和我国文化大革命
　　毛主席领导文化大革命保证国际共运彻底胜利

　　美帝和现代修正主义如胆敢侵犯中国，一定被打得粉身碎骨
    新华社广州二十八日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长、阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团团长贝基尔·巴卢库一月二十七日，在广州部队负责人举行的欢送宴会上，发表长篇热情洋溢的讲话。
    巴卢库同志高度评价中国的无产阶级文化大革命。他说，在你们国家生活的这些天里，我们实际的、生动地感受到你们全体革命人民、革命师生、工人阶级、革命干部所经历的这个空前的政治思想的大革命——伟大的无产阶级文化大革命。我们十分高兴地看到，中国无产阶级文化大革命正在广泛地深入地开展，你们这里和全国各地一样，政治思想普遍高涨，无产阶级文化大革命成了群众性的事业，你们正在走向胜利。
    巴卢库同志叙述了中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下经历过的伟大阶级斗争，打败日本帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和美帝国主义侵略者，取得革命的胜利的光荣历史。他说，中国人民在取得胜利以后的今天，开展轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，这是英雄的中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下所进行的伟大事业，具有重大的历史意义，进入了中国和中国人民历史的新阶段。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，你们的工业突飞猛进，农村社会主义建设迅速发展，社会主义的新文化正在繁荣，这一切伟大的胜利和成就，都是革命人民在伟大的中国共产党领导下的功绩，都是卓越的马克思列宁主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民亲爱的朋友毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的思想和学说的胜利，是他把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命实践相结合的光辉胜利。中国人民、中国工人阶级和一切劳动人民像钢铁般的团结在党和卓越的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的周围。中国人民在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，经历着前人没有走过的道路。中国人民对党和毛主席十分敬爱，十分信仰，对毛泽东同志的教导毫不犹豫地坚决执行。不论在国内还是国外，任何力量都动摇不了中国共产党和毛泽东同志教导下的中国人民胜利的信心。中国人民的文化大革命标志着中国国内的一个重大的历史阶段，对国际工人运动和共产主义运动起着巨大的促进作用，它捍卫和巩固了无产阶级革命事业。毛泽东同志亲手发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命对保证中国和国际共产主义运动、工人运动的彻底胜利，具有重大的意义。这个革命是在理论上和实践上对马克思列宁主义学说的一个贡献。美帝国主义极端的仇视你们的文化大革命，苏联修正主义者和他的同伙也是这样仇视文化大革命。因为这个革命使他们的希望彻底破产。他们的希望就是有这么一天，对中国和阿尔巴尼亚进行政治思想上的反革命的篡夺，但是它们的计划在无产阶级文化大革命面前彻底破产了。巴卢库同志强调说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党支持无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，也就是保卫我们自己，捍卫我们自己的事业。
    巴卢库同志在讲话中热情歌颂毛主席的人民战争思想。他说，我们看到了你们光荣的民兵，看到了你们这里男女老少的这种保卫祖国、保卫革命、保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的坚强决心。在你们祖国，在广州和在任何地方，都是全民皆兵。我们深信，假如有这么一个疯子，或者军事冒险家，像美帝国主义或者现代修正主义那样，敢于来侵犯中国，那么在这里就分不出那里是前方那里是后方，全中国都像一个人一样，起来给侵略者和敌人以毁灭性的打击，把他们打得粉身碎骨，永远也起不来。巴卢库同志称赞说，你们很好地运用了毛泽东同志的军事思想和人民战争思想。有那一个资本主义国家，修正主义国家，敢于把武器交给人民呢？没有。他们都不敢，他们惧怕人民，只有你们把武器交给人民，使人民真正的掌握了革命和祖国的命运，这是一个意义深远的马克思列宁主义的观点。我们阿尔巴尼亚也是这样，我们也有民兵，我们党和霍查同志的口号是：“提高警惕，掌握武器，准备保卫革命！”我们那儿从七岁到七十岁的人都是武装起来的，来捍卫党的事业。我国的民兵和人民军，学习党和霍查同志的教导，学习中国民兵和中国军队的经验，学习和运用毛泽东同志的军事著作和军事思想。假如敌人发动侵略的话，我们也是打人民战争，把侵略者淹没在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。
    巴卢库同志在讲话中，满怀革命激情歌颂中阿两国人民和军队的战斗友谊。他说，我们一到部队，战士们就拥上来，把朋友们包围了，并且包围了我们好几次。这些包围是兄弟的深厚友谊的表现，说明了我们的友谊是根深蒂固的。你们和我们都是互相了解的，我们的友谊是完完全全的人民的友谊，战斗的和革命的友谊。这个友谊是永垂不朽的，没有任何力量能够破坏这个友谊。因为这个友谊是我们两国的党，是我们两国伟大的领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志所缔造的。我们的友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义思想基础上的，这种友谊必将与世界共存，我们将永远在一起前进，牢不可分。我们的友谊经过了狂风暴雨的考验，是纯洁的人民之间的友谊，是国际主义的友谊。我们的敌人非常妒嫉也非常害怕我们这种国际主义的友谊和合作。我们两党在革命的道路上，在捍卫马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义斗争的道路上，肩并肩地毫不动摇地前进。巴卢库同志说，今天，马克思列宁主义的旗帜是飘扬在天安门上，是掌握在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东同志手里。今天的中国和毛泽东同志领导的中国共产党，已经成了世界工人运动和共产主义运动脊髓骨。谁反对中国，谁就是反对马克思列宁主义，是反革命，是修正主义；谁保卫中国，谁就是保卫无产阶级革命，保卫马克思列宁主义，这是客观存在的马克思列宁主义的事实。我们为同你们是朋友、战友和兄弟而感到自豪。巴卢库同志说，站在动摇立场上的人总有一天会陷入机会主义或者修正主义的泥坑，这是一定的。或者和我们站在一起，或者反对我们，只有这样两条道路。巴卢库同志说，但是，人民是站在我们一边的。正如毛泽东同志所说的百分之九十五以上的人民是站在我们这一边的。无产者站在我们一边，革命者站在我们一边，被压迫人民站在我们这一边，马克思列宁主义者站在我们这一边，因此，胜利是我们的，这是无可置疑的。我们必胜！
