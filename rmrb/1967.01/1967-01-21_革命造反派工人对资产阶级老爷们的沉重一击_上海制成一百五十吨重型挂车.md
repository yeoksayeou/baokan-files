Revolutionary rebel workers deliver a heavy blow to the bourgeois gentlemen
Shanghai produces a 150-ton heavy-duty trailer

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 20th: The revolutionary rebel workers and revolutionary staff of the Shanghai Automobile Transport Company Repair Factory, under the great call of Chairman Mao's "grasp revolution, promote production," recently manufactured China's first 150-ton heavy-duty flatbed trailer. This is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought and another heavy blow to the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The 150-ton heavy-duty flatbed trailer is specifically designed to solve the problem of transporting heavy industrial and mining equipment weighing over 100 tons. If such a flatbed trailer were to be purchased from abroad, not only would it be expensive and have a long delivery time, but it would also be subject to various difficulties imposed by imperialist and revisionist countries. The revolutionary rebel workers of the Shanghai Automobile Transport Company Repair Factory listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and are the most resolute in implementing Chairman Mao's "grasp revolution, promote production" policy. The factory has poor equipment, no experts, no data, and no precise processing machinery. However, the revolutionary rebel workers have a heart that burns with love for Chairman Mao. They hold the shining red works of Chairman Mao, the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, and can overcome all difficulties on the road ahead. During the manufacturing process, the revolutionary rebel workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "The Chinese people have the spirit, have the ability, and will definitely catch up with and surpass the world's advanced level in the not-too-distant future." They poured the boundless enthusiasm unleashed during the Cultural Revolution into the production struggle to trial-manufacture the flatbed trailer.

Under the efforts of all the revolutionary rebel workers in the factory and with the strong assistance of revolutionary workers from sister units such as the Dalong Machinery Factory, a heavy-duty flatbed trailer with advanced technology was finally manufactured. After testing, it has minimal turning resistance and requires less effort to load cargo compared to imported flatbed trailers.

The successful trial production of this heavy-duty flatbed trailer shows that revolutionary rebel workers are not only the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution but also models of "grasp revolution, promote production."

　　革命造反派工人对资产阶级老爷们的沉重一击
　　上海制成一百五十吨重型挂车
    据新华社上海二十日电　上海市汽车运输公司修理厂革命造反派和革命职工，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召下，最近制造出我国第一台载重一百五十吨的重型平板挂车。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，是对资产阶级反动路线新反扑的又一个沉重的回击。
    载重一百五十吨的重型平板挂车是专为解决装运一百吨以上的重型工矿设备用的。这种平板挂车如果向国外购买，不但价高、交货期长，而且还要受到帝国主义和修正主义国家的百般刁难。上海市汽车运输公司修理厂广大革命造反派工人最听毛主席的话，最坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。这个工厂的设备差，没有专家，没有资料，没有精密的加工机床，但是革命造反派工人有一颗热爱毛主席的火热的心。他们手里有着红光闪闪的毛主席著作，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，能克服前进路上的一切困难。在制造过程中，革命造反派工人反复学习了毛主席的“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平”的教导，把在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，积极投入到试制平板挂车的生产斗争中去。
    在全厂革命造反派工人的努力下，在大隆机器厂等兄弟单位的革命职工大力协助下，一辆具有先进技术水平的重型平板挂车，终于制造成功。经过试运，转弯阻力小，装运货物比进口的平板挂车省力。
    这种重型平板挂车的试制成功，说明了革命造反派工人不但是文化大革命中的尖兵，而且是抓革命，促生产的模范。
