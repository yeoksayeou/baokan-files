At the end of 1966, British Foreign Secretary Brown sent an urgent telegram to the U.S. government, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the U.S. puppet regime in South Vietnam, proposing a so-called "three-party talks." This is a new trick in the big conspiracy of U.S.-Soviet collusion, colluding with Britain, to push for "peace talks" on the Vietnam issue. The spokesperson of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry has already issued a statement on the 3rd, severely condemning the British government's so-called "proposal" for serving the U.S. aggressors.

The British Labour government is an accomplice to U.S. aggression in Vietnam. To serve the U.S. "peace talks" conspiracy, the collusion between London and Moscow has become increasingly close. It was this same Brown who, last year, specially went to Moscow to conspire with the Soviet revisionist leadership to help the U.S. "peace talks" deception.

Brown's attempt to pull off this trick is indeed very clumsy. Brown just threw out the "three-party talks" "proposal," and the next day, another lackey of U.S. imperialism, UN Secretary-General U Thant, hurriedly sent a reply to U.S. Representative to the UN Goldberg, advocating "stopping the bombing of North Vietnam" and "extending the New Year ceasefire." Johnson himself also personally praised Brown's "proposal." This clearly shows that Brown's proposal and U Thant's reply are all items from Johnson's bag.

In recent days, U.S. imperialism has been increasing troops in South Vietnam and intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, while at the same time eagerly trying to use the "New Year ceasefire" to create a fait accompli of "peace talks." Rusk admitted on December 21 last year that the "biggest failure" of the U.S. in 1966 was that it "could not find a way" to make the "peace talks" deception succeed. However, U.S. imperialism is not giving up. It will continue to expand its war of aggression in Vietnam and continue to plot "peace talks." At the end and beginning of the year, U.S. imperialism's activities of "forcing peace" and "baiting peace" have become intense. This is the background for Brown and U Thant to hurriedly promote the U.S. "peace talks" deception.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has been playing the role of the number one accomplice in the U.S. imperialist's counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy, pushing the conspiracy of "forcing peace through war" and "forcing peace through bombing."

The U.S. is currently pushing the "peace talks" deception because it has obtained the close cooperation and encouragement of the Soviet revisionist leadership's surrender policy. Resolutely exposing and opposing the Soviet revisionist leadership's surrender policy is a support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. and a blow to U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression in Vietnam.

Chairman Mao said: "Anything reactionary that you do not attack will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor. Where the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself."

The U.S. imperialist aggressors in Vietnam will not be eliminated on their own; the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, the Soviet revisionist leadership, the British Labour government, and the likes of U Thant, will not voluntarily give up their "peace talks" deception. The heroic Vietnamese people are striking blows against the U.S. aggressors with their fighting actions, exposing the Johnson administration's conspiracy of "forcing peace" and "baiting peace." The great Vietnamese people's war of resistance against the U.S. will certainly break through all obstacles and achieve final victory.

    约翰逊皮包里的货色
    本报评论员
    一九六六年年终，英国外交大臣布朗向美国政府、越南民主共和国政府和美国在南越的傀儡政权发出了一个所谓建议“三方会谈”的紧急电报。这是美苏勾结，串通英国，在越南问题上推行
  “和谈”大阴谋的一个新花招。越南外交部发言人已经在三日发表声明，严厉谴责英国政府这个为美国侵略强盗效劳的所谓“建议”。
    英国工党政府是美帝侵略越南的帮凶。为了替美帝的“和谈”阴谋效劳，伦敦和莫斯科之间的勾搭日益紧密。就是这个布朗，去年曾专程跑到莫斯科，同苏联修正主义领导集团共同出谋划策，为美国“和谈”骗局帮忙。
    布朗这一次出来搞这一套鬼名堂，其手法实在太拙劣了。布朗刚刚抛出“三方会谈”的“建议”，美帝国主义的另一名走卒联合国秘书长吴丹，第二天就急忙向美国驻联合国代表戈德堡发出复函，鼓吹“停止对北越的轰炸”和“延长新年停火”。约翰逊也亲自出马大肆赞扬布朗的“建议”。这就清楚地表明，布朗的建议和吴丹的复函，通通都是约翰逊皮包里的货色。
    这几天来，美帝国主义一面不断增兵越南南方、加紧轰炸越南北方，一面则迫不及待地企图利用“新年停火”来造成“和谈”的既成事实。腊斯克去年十二月二十一日曾悲哀地承认，美国“一九六六年中最大的失败”，是“没有能够找到办法”使“和谈”骗局得逞。但是，美帝国主义是绝不死心的，它还要继续在越南扩大战争冒险，继续搞“和谈”阴谋。岁末年首之际，美帝国主义的“迫和”与“诱和”活动，就紧张起来了。这就是布朗、吴丹匆匆忙忙出来为美国“和谈”骗局大卖力气的背景。
    苏联修正主义领导集团，在美帝国主义加紧施展反革命两手政策、推行“以战迫和”、“以炸迫和”的阴谋中，一直扮演着头号帮凶的角色。
    美国目前大搞“和谈”骗局，就是因为得到苏联修正主义领导集团的投降政策的密切配合和鼓励。坚决揭露和反对苏联修正主义领导集团的投降政策，就是对越南人民抗美救国战争的支持，就是对美帝国主义侵越政策的打击。
    毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”
    美帝国主义在越南的侵略势力，是不会自行消灭的；美帝国主义及其合伙者苏联修正主义领导集团、英国工党政府以及吴丹之流，策动“和谈”骗局，也是不会自动放弃的，英雄的越南人民，正以自己的战斗行动，打击美国侵略强盗，揭露约翰逊政府的“迫和”与“诱和”阴谋。伟大的越南人民抗美救国战争，必将冲破一切障碍，取得最后的胜利。
