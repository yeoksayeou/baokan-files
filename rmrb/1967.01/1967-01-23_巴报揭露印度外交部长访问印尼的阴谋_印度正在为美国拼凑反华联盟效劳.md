Pakistani newspaper exposes India's plot during foreign minister's visit to Indonesia
India is helping the United States form an anti-China alliance

	LAHORE, Jan. 21 (New China News Agency) - The Lahore "Pakistan Times" published a commentary on the 21st saying that the anti-China statements made by Indian Foreign Minister Chagla during his visit to Indonesia clearly show that India is helping the United States form a new anti-China alliance in South Asia and Southeast Asia.

	The commentary pointed out that due to the failure of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam and the actual paralysis of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the United States has long been eager to plot a new "containment of China" alliance in South Asia and Southeast Asia. This is no secret. At the same time, official U.S. publications have been publishing commentaries, expressing the hope of forming some kind of alliance, including India, Indonesia, and Japan. The commentary said that Chagla's activities in Jakarta show that "India is currently preparing to assist Washington in this diplomatic effort, which has so far been ineffective."

　　巴报揭露印度外交部长访问印尼的阴谋
　　印度正在为美国拼凑反华联盟效劳
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二十一日电　拉瓦尔品第《巴基斯坦时报》二十一日发表评论说，印度外交部长库里姆·查格拉在访问印度尼西亚期间发表的反华言论清楚地表明，印度正为美国在南亚和东南亚建立一个反华新联盟效劳。
    评论指出，美国由于侵越战争的失败和东南亚条约组织实际上的瘫痪，一直急于在南亚和东南亚策划一个“遏制中国”的新联盟，这已不是什么秘密了。同时，得到官方支持的美国报刊也在纷纷发表评论，表示希望结成某种形式的联盟，其中包括印度、印度尼西亚和日本。评论说，查格拉在雅加达的活动表明，“印度目前正准备协助华盛顿从事这种迄今毫无成效的外交努力”。
