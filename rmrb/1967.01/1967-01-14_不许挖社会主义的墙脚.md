Just as our transportation cooperative's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering the decisive battle between the two lines, a handful of stubborn elements who insist on the capitalist reactionary line have colluded with some demons and monsters to launch a ferocious new counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary line. They use the "sugar-coated bullets" of economic benefits to corrupt and tempt a portion of the masses, attempting to shift the direction of the struggle. Currently, they have already indiscriminately distributed 39,000 yuan. They also deliberately create incidents, inciting some workers to leave their production posts and disrupt transportation, causing serious impacts on production and people's lives. Their despicable goal is to attempt to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and dig at the foundations of socialism.

Our revolutionary rebel workers have clear minds and sharp eyes, immediately seeing through their evil intentions. Comrade Zhang Xue, an old worker from a poor peasant background, said, "This money is dug from the foundations of socialism, and we workers absolutely cannot spend it!" The next morning, he deposited the money in the bank, preparing to return it to the state. Old worker Gao Cai has a large family and a relatively difficult life. However, after receiving this money, he immediately deposited it in the bank. He firmly said, "The purpose of the Cultural Revolution is to make our socialist state more solid. If they continue like this, this state will quickly collapse, and we will not allow it!"

Our revolutionary rebel workers, after hearing the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, and the emergency notice issued by various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai, have become even more determined to fight against the capitalist reactionary line. We must follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao for the revolutionary rebels, firmly grasp the leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production in the hands of the revolutionary rebels, and strive to achieve double victories in the cultural revolution and production!

    不许挖社会主义的墙脚
    正当我们运输合作社的无产阶级文化大革命进入两条路线决战的时候，一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，和一些牛鬼蛇神勾结起来，向无产阶级革命路线进行了猖狂的新反扑。他们用经济福利的“糖衣炮弹”，腐蚀、诱惑一部分群众，妄想转移斗争的大方向。目前，他们已滥发出三万九千余元。他们还故意制造事件，唆使一些工人离开生产岗位，中断运输，给生产和人民生活造成严重影响。他们的卑鄙目的，就是妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，挖社会主义的墙脚。
    我们革命造反派的工人心明眼亮，立即识破了他们的罪恶目的。贫农出身的老工人张学如同志说：“这个钱是从社会主义墙脚里挖出来的，我们工人决不能花！”第二天一早，他就把钱存入银行，准备交还国家。老工人高才同志家庭人口多，生活比较困难。可是，他拿到这笔钱后，立即存入了银行。他坚定地说：“文化大革命的目的是为了使我们的社会主义江山更牢靠，照他们这样干下去，这个江山很快就会垮台，我们决不答应！”
    我们革命造反派的职工，听了中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电，和上海市各革命群众组织发表的《紧急通告》，更加坚定了向资产阶级反动路线进行斗争的决心。我们一定要沿着毛主席指明的革命造反派的大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命和生产领导权紧紧地掌握在革命造反派的手里，努力夺取文化革命和生产的双胜利！
