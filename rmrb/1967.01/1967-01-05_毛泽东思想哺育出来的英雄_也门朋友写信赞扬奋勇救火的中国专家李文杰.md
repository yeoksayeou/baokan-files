On a holiday in February 1966, Li Wenjie and Zhou Fuling, technicians from the Chinese expert team assisting Yemen in road construction, were using their day off to inspect and repair the roller with Yemeni workers. Suddenly, a Yemeni worker accidentally touched a wire brush wrapped in iron to the motor's live wire, causing a fire that ignited a large bucket of gasoline underneath the roller. In this critical moment, Young Communist League member Li Wenjie, without hesitation, jumped down from the roller and moved the burning gasoline bucket several meters away from the machine, preventing a major fire. However, Li Wenjie, whose entire body was covered in gasoline, was severely burned. When comrades rushed to rescue and comfort him, he said, "As long as the Yemeni friends are not injured and the machine is not damaged, I am fine."

Li Wenjie's heroic deed quickly spread among the Yemeni people. Four Yemeni friends wrote a letter full of enthusiasm to Li Wenjie. The letter reads as follows:

Dear Comrade Li Wenjie:

Your heroic deeds of wholeheartedly serving our people have moved us deeply. Your heroic deeds show that Mao Zedong Thought not only nurtures heroes like Wang Jie, Lei Feng, Zhang Zedong, and many others in China, but also nurtures heroes like you in Yemen—a country thousands of miles away from your homeland. It also clearly shows that the internationalist spirit demonstrated by Norman Bethune is taking root and bearing fruit among the revolutionary youth of China.

Comrade, you are indeed a warrior with an internationalist spirit sent by our great leader Chairman Mao to Yemen. Your heroic deeds set an example shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought. The working class and people of Yemen will all learn from you.

Apart from praising you and expressing brotherly affection, we have nothing else to offer you. We are determined to learn from you, work better, and further strengthen the revolutionary friendship between our two peoples, and strengthen the struggle against our common enemy—the imperialists led by American imperialism, the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet leadership, and all reactionaries.

Your heroic actions in Yemen are another victory for the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Long live the fighting unity and revolutionary friendship between the people of Yemen and China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao!

Yemen, Hashi, Lajiak, Aierxi, Daheng

    毛泽东思想哺育出来的英雄
    也门朋友写信赞扬奋勇救火的中国专家李文杰
    一九六六年二月的一个假日，中国援助也门修筑公路的专家组技工李文杰和周孚龙，正利用休息日和也门工人一起检查维修轧石机。
    突然一个也门工人不慎将包有铁皮的刷子触及电瓶马达的火线，引起失火，使放在轧石机下面的一大盆汽油熊熊地燃烧起来。在这个万分紧急的关头，共青团员李文杰奋不顾身，从轧石机上一跃而下，把着火的汽油盆端到离机器几米以外的地方。一场严重的火灾避免了。可是，全身沾满汽油的李文杰却被烧伤了。当同志们赶来抢救和慰问他时，他说：“只要没有伤着也门朋友，没有烧着机器，我没有关系。”
    李文杰的英雄事迹迅即在也门人民中间流传。四位也门朋友给李文杰写了一封热情洋溢的信。这封信是这样写的：
    亲爱的李文杰同志：
    你全心全意地为我国人民工作的英雄事迹激动着我们的心。你的英雄事迹表明：毛泽东思想不仅能在中国哺育出王杰、雷锋、张思德和其他许许多多的英雄，而且也能在也门——一个离你的祖国几千里之外的国家里——哺育出像你这样的英雄人物。而且它也清楚表明：白求恩表现出来的这种国际主义精神正在中国革命的青年中生根发芽，开花结果。
    同志，你不愧是一个我们伟大领袖毛主席派到也门来的具有国际主义精神的战士。你的英雄事迹为我们树立了一个闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的榜样，也门的工人阶级和也门人民都要向你学习。
    我们除了赞扬和对你表示兄弟般的情谊之外，没有别的东西可以献给你，我们决心学习你，更好地工作，以进一步加强我们两国人民之间的革命友谊，加强反对我们的共同敌人——以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和一切反动派的斗争。
    你在也门的英雄行为是伟大的毛泽东思想的又一次胜利。
    也门与中国人民之间的战斗团结和革命友谊万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席万岁！
                    也门　哈希、拉查克、爱尔希、达亨
