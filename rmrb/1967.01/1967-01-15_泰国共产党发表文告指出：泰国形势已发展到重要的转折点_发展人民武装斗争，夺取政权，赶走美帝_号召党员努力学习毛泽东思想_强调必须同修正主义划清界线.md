The Communist Party of Thailand issued a declaration to the people of the nation stating that the situation in Thailand has reached a crucial turning point. The declaration calls for the development of armed struggle by the people to seize power and expel the American imperialists. It urges party members to strive to study Mao Zedong Thought and emphasizes the need to draw a clear line with revisionism.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 14th, a message from the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station on the 7th broadcasted a declaration from the Communist Party of Thailand to the people of the nation. The declaration pointed out that the domestic situation in Thailand has reached a crucial turning point, and the Thai people have summed up the valuable experience that they must seize power through armed struggle. The declaration also calls on all party members to strive to study the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought.

The declaration states that since the Communist Party of Thailand was established on December 1, 1942, it has consistently adhered to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and has resolutely fought for the national liberation, independence, happiness of the people, and world peace of Thailand. Over the past 24 years, imperialism and the reactionary ruling classes of various periods in Thailand have attempted to brutally and savagely eliminate our party. However, because our party has executed correct principles and policies that are completely in line with the interests of the people and the nation, it has garnered the broad support of the Thai people. Currently, our party is even stronger and more robust, and has become the core political force that bravely and resolutely fights against American imperialism and its traitorous lackeys.

The declaration states that the Communist Party of Thailand has developed and grown stronger in the context of domestic and international turmoil. In particular, the current international situation is greatly favorable to the struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world. The struggles of revolutionary nations and peoples against American imperialism, the reactionaries of various countries, and revisionism are flourishing and advancing. International class struggle is becoming more intense and profound. The world revolution is entering a new stage. Currently, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. The revolutionary forces of the world will definitely achieve victory, and the reactionary forces will definitely collapse.

The declaration states that currently, the revolutionary forces of the world, especially the revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are continuously developing in depth and breadth. Revolutionary peoples are increasingly recognizing that without the armed forces of the people, there is nothing for the people. Therefore, they are determined to take up arms and fight. Armed struggle has become the main form of struggle for the peoples of these three continents.

The declaration states that the people's war currently being waged in South Vietnam is the focal point of the struggle between the revolutionary forces and the reactionary forces of the world. The Vietnamese people are resolutely standing at the forefront of the struggle against all reactionary forces led by American imperialism. The victory of the Vietnamese people has fully exposed the paper tiger nature of American imperialism and its lackeys, and has made a great contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, including the Thai people.

The declaration states that under the wise leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved tremendous successes in all aspects of socialist construction. The successful nuclear explosion and the launch of nuclear missiles have greatly inspired the revolutionary peoples of the world and have made a great contribution to the cause of defending world peace.

The declaration states that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in all of China is a great initiative led by Comrade Mao Zedong, an unprecedented revolutionary movement, and a development of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. It is aimed at consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, uprooting the social roots of revisionism, preventing the restoration of capitalist forces, and paving the way for the transition from a socialist society to a communist society. The strength of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party and the great achievements mentioned above have a tremendous impact on the revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world and the development of humanity.

The declaration states that the new leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has inherited the legacy of Khrushchev, executing Khrushchev-style revisionism with even more cunning and deceitful methods. The Soviet revisionist leadership is the culprit of the split in the international communist movement. They collude with imperialism to maintain colonialism, allow capitalism to be restored in socialist countries, oppose the people's revolution, and oppose the great People's Republic of China. They have betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed proletarian internationalism, betrayed the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and oppressed nations, and betrayed the interests of the great Soviet people.

The declaration states that our party has never agreed with the views of revisionism from the beginning and has always opposed it. We believe that true Marxists-Leninists must draw a clear line with revisionism and must not engage in "joint actions" with revisionism. Between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, there can be no neutrality or compromise policy. Adopting a neutral and compromising stance towards revisionism will only bring irreparable serious losses to the revolutionary cause of the peoples of the world.

The declaration states that the situation in Thailand has also greatly developed. Due to the intensified aggression of American imperialism, the Thanom-Praphat clique has become even more traitorous and dictatorial, bringing disaster to the nation. Due to the awakening of the Thai people and the further development of the struggle for national salvation, the struggle of the Thai people against American imperialism and its traitorous puppet government is becoming increasingly fierce. Therefore, the situation in Thailand has reached a historically significant turning point.

The declaration states that after a long and arduous struggle, the Thai people have come to understand that only by seizing power through armed struggle by the people, and daring to use revolutionary violence to decisively defeat counter-revolutionary violence, can the suffering of the people be completely alleviated and the nation be saved. By summing up this valuable experience in struggle, the Thai people's struggles in recent years, especially in the vast rural areas, and first and foremost in the Northeast and South, have developed armed struggles by the people in many areas, established armed forces of the people, and bravely counterattacked the enemy's "sweeping operations," inflicting heavy losses on the enemy multiple times. The initial victories of the armed forces of the people in the Northeast and South have shown that the struggle of the Thai people has entered a new stage. It has set an example for the people of the nation, inspiring and promoting the rapid development and growth of the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people.

The declaration calls on the people of the nation to unite and organize a broad patriotic democratic united front, to cooperate and support each other in all aspects, and to fight the enemy in various forms, especially to fully support the armed forces of the people.

The declaration states that the Communist Party of Thailand is the vanguard of the Thai people. Over the past 24 years, in every period, it has fought bravely and tenaciously with the Thai people against imperialism and the traitorous dictatorial ruling class. In the future, the Communist Party of Thailand will continue to fight shoulder to shoulder with the people of the nation for the final victory of the great and glorious cause.

The declaration states that every member of the Communist Party of Thailand must closely connect with the masses, unite with as many masses as possible; must be a good example for the masses, guard their posts, and strive to complete the tasks given by the party and the people; must have perseverance, courage, and a spirit of sacrifice, be prepared to face all hardships and dangers without wavering; must strive to improve their Marxism-Leninism theoretical level, especially to actively study the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, reform their worldview and improve their work methods, humbly learn from the masses, not detach from the masses, constantly strengthen their revolutionary will, and carry forward the spirit of daring to think, daring to do, not fearing hardship, and not fearing death. They must firmly fight against various forms of revisionist thought and resolutely eliminate the tendency of revisionism within the party.

The declaration calls on every party member to place political and ideological work at the forefront of all work, to enhance their tenacious fighting spirit, to seriously study, understand, and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's strategies and tactics on guerrilla warfare to improve military technology, and to flexibly and actively attack the enemy. Only by resolutely annihilating the enemy's fighting forces can one preserve one's own forces, develop and grow one's own forces, and ultimately defeat the enemy.

The declaration finally calls on the people of the nation to fight to the end to expel American imperialism from Thailand, overthrow the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, and build a truly independent, democratic, peaceful, neutral, and prosperous new Thailand. The declaration firmly believes that the final victory will belong to the Thai people.

    泰国共产党发表文告指出：泰国形势已发展到重要的转折点
    发展人民武装斗争，夺取政权，赶走美帝
    号召党员努力学习毛泽东思想　强调必须同修正主义划清界线
    据新华社十四日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台七日广播了泰国共产党向全国人民发表的文告。文告指出，泰国国内形势已经发展到重要的转折点，泰国人民总结了必须用武装斗争夺取政权这一宝贵经验。文告还号召全体党员努力学习当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰毛泽东思想。
    文告说，泰国共产党自一九四二年十二月一日宣告成立的第一天起，一向坚持马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则，并为泰国的民族解放、国家独立、人民幸福和世界和平而坚决斗争。二十四年来，帝国主义和泰国各时期的反动统治阶级妄图野蛮残暴地消灭我们的党。但是，由于我们党执行着完全符合人民和民族利益的正确原则和政策，所以博得了泰国人民的广泛支持。目前我们的党更加坚强壮大，已经成为坚决勇敢地同美帝国主义及其卖国走狗进行斗争的政治力量的核心。
    文告说，泰国共产党是在国内外大动荡的形势下发展壮大的。特别是目前，国际形势大大有利于世界革命人民的斗争。革命民族和革命人民反对美帝国主义、各国反动派和修正主义的斗争正在蓬勃地向前发展，国际阶级斗争更加激烈和深入。世界革命正跨进一个新阶段。目前，东风压倒西风。全世界革命力量一定取得胜利，反动力量一定崩溃。
    文告说，目前世界革命力量，特别是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命运动正在不断向深度和广度发展。革命人民不断认识到，在同帝国主义以及反动派的斗争中，如果没有人民的武装力量就没有人民的一切。因此，他们决心拿起武器进行斗争。武装斗争成为这三大洲人民的主要斗争形式。
    文告说，正在越南南方进行的人民战争，是世界革命力量和反动力量进行斗争的焦点。越南人民坚决站在向以美帝国主义为首的一切反动力量斗争的最前线。越南人民的胜利，充分证明了美帝国主义及其走狗的纸老虎本质，并且对世界人民包括泰国人民的革命斗争作出伟大的贡献。
    文告说，今天，在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的英明领导下的中国人民，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，在社会主义建设的各个方面取得了巨大成就。核爆炸以及发射导弹核武器的成功，给世界革命人民以巨大的鼓舞，为保卫世界和平事业作出了巨大贡献。
    文告说，正在全中国轰轰烈烈开展的无产阶级文化大革命，是毛泽东同志亲自领导下的中国共产党的伟大创举，是史无前例的革命运动，是把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段，为巩固无产阶级专政，挖掉修正主义的社会根子，防止资本主义势力复辟，为从社会主义社会胜利过渡到共产主义社会开辟道路。中国人民和中国共产党的强大和所取得的上述伟大成就，对于世界人民革命运动和人类的发展起着巨大的影响。
    文告说，苏联共产党新领导集团，继承赫鲁晓夫的衣钵，以更狡猾奸诈的手段，执行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫修正主义。苏共修正主义领导集团是分裂国际共产主义运动的祸首。他们与帝国主义互相勾结维护殖民主义，让资本主义在社会主义国家复辟，反对人民革命和反对伟大的中华人民共和国。他们背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了无产阶级国际主义，背叛了国际无产阶级和被压迫民族的革命事业，背叛了伟大的苏联人民的利益。
    文告说，我们党从开始就根本不同意修正主义的观点，并一直进行反对。我们认为，真正的马克思列宁主义者必须与修正主义划清界线，决不能同修正主义搞“联合行动”。在马克思列宁主义与修正主义两者之间，决不能采取中立或妥协政策。对修正主义采取中立和妥协路线，只有给世界人民革命事业带来不可弥补的严重损失。
    文告说，泰国的形势也同样大大发展，由于美帝国主义的加紧侵略，他侬—巴博集团变本加厉地卖国独裁、祸国殃民。由于泰国人民的觉醒和救国斗争的进一步发展，泰国人民对美帝国主义及其走狗卖国政权的斗争日益激烈。因此，泰国的形势发展到了具有历史意义的重要转折点。
    文告说，泰国人民经过长期顽强的斗争后懂得，只有用人民武装斗争的方式去夺取政权，只有敢于用革命的暴力坚决地去战胜反革命的暴力，才能彻底解除人民的痛苦和拯救国家。由于总结了这一宝贵的斗争经验，泰国人民这几年来的斗争，特别是广大的农村，首先是东北部和南部人民，已经在许多地区发展了人民武装斗争，成立了人民武装队伍，英勇地反击敌人的“扫荡”，使敌人多次遭到严重损失。东北部和南部人民武装所取得的初步胜利，说明了泰国人民的斗争已跨进新的阶段。它给全国人民树立了榜样，鼓舞和推动了泰国人民的革命斗争迅速发展壮大。
    文告呼吁全国人民团结起来，组织广泛的爱国民主统一阵线，在各个方面互相配合互相支援，同敌人进行各种形式的斗争，特别是要全力支援人民武装队伍。
    文告说，泰国共产党是泰国人民的先锋队，二十四年来，不论在那个时期，都和泰国人民在一起，同帝国主义和卖国独裁的统治阶级进行英勇顽强的斗争。今后，泰国共产党将继续和全国人民在一起，为伟大光荣的事业取得最后胜利而并肩作战。
    文告说，泰国共产党的每个党员必须密切联系群众，最大限度地团结一切可以团结的群众；必须成为群众的好榜样，坚守自己的岗位，努力出色地去完成党和人民交给的任务；必须有坚韧不拔、勇敢和牺牲的精神，准备面临一切艰苦和危险而毫不动摇；必须努力提高马克思列宁主义理论水平，特别是要积极学习当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰毛泽东思想，改造世界观和改进工作方法，虚心向群众学习，不脱离群众，不断加强革命意志，发扬敢想、敢干、不怕苦、不怕死的精神，坚持同形形色色的修正主义思想作斗争，坚决注意清除在党内产生的修正主义的倾向。
    文告号召每个党员必须把政治思想工作放在一切工作的首位，必须提高顽强的斗志，必须认真学习、领会和运用毛泽东同志关于游击战争的战略战术，来提高军事技术，灵活主动地进攻敌人。只有坚决消灭敌人的有生力量，才能保存自己的力量，发展壮大自己的力量，直至最后战胜敌人。
    文告最后号召全国人民为把美帝国主义赶出泰国，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，建立一个真正独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣的新泰国而奋斗到底。文告并坚信最后胜利一定是属于泰国人民的。
