Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought have a great revolutionary ideal, the strongest resolve, and the strongest fighting spirit. Huang Jiguang, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande are like this, and so is Captain Huang Bu San of the cargo ship 1018, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works.

In the face of the enemy's guns and cannons, he was fearless; in the face of life and death, he thought of the revolutionary cause and Chairman Mao. Therefore, people praised him as another "Mai Xiande."

On August 29 of last year, American air pirates suddenly attacked our small cargo ships 1018 and 1019. As soon as Huang Bu San heard the sound of guns, he thought, "The time to sacrifice for the people has come." He immediately rushed to the bridge. At that moment, machine guns, rockets, and bombs rained down like bullets, and the roar was deafening.

Huang Bu San, the son of a poor fisherman, had been working for the fishery tyrants and Japanese imperialism since he was twelve, enduring endless exploitation and oppression. Today, facing the enemy's bombing and strafing, old and new grievances surged in his heart. He had only one belief: "Fight! Definitely drive the ship to Vietnam." The enemy's bombing and strafing did not shake Huang Bu San's revolutionary will in the slightest. His hate-filled eyes stared straight ahead, and his hands tightly gripped the engine telegraph, accurately signaling different speeds to the engine room comrades, avoiding enemy aircraft attacks time and time again.

Suddenly, a rocket hit the bridge, and Huang Bu San was injured in 35 places. His left forehead was blown open, his skull was shattered, and his right leg was also seriously injured. He instantly collapsed on the bridge.

The enemy's shells could injure a person's body, but they could not destroy the red heart of a heroic sailor loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. When Huang Bu San regained consciousness, the first words he said were, "Second Officer, quickly start the ship!" Enduring the excruciating pain throughout his body, with astonishing willpower, he stood up, covered in blood, and tightly gripped the steering wheel, exerting all his strength to steer. At this moment, the engine stopped, the steering wheel malfunctioned, and the ship rapidly sank. Comrades helped him onto a life raft, and Huang Bu San fainted again.

The enemy aircraft circled overhead. Huang Bu San, in a state of unconsciousness, woke up and called out the names of his comrades. Xu Junrui and Xiong Yaozhang, who were escorting him, said, "Captain, don't worry. We are both Communist Party members. As long as we are here, you are here. We will definitely take you to the island!" Under the escort of his comrades, Huang Bu San finally landed on a deserted island.

On the island, Huang Bu San faced a new test. Although his comrades hid him in a cave and covered him with two work uniforms, there was no food, and his wounds could not be treated. No matter how severe the situation or how dangerous the environment, it could not frighten the heroic sailor armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Huang Bu San thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades should see achievements and see the light when facing difficulties, and raise our courage." He thought: No matter how big the difficulties, they were not as big as the difficulties during the Long March. As long as there is Mao Zedong Thought and class brothers with him, any difficulty can be overcome.

When the comrades taking care of him went up the mountain to find wild fruits, Huang Bu San developed a high fever. At this moment, he needed water so badly! But where could he find water? Should he wait for his comrades to bring it? No, he couldn't! The stubborn Huang Bu San, with both hands supporting the ground, slowly moved forward with his feet. Every time he moved, his injured limbs felt like they were being cut by a knife. Based on his past experience, he estimated that there would be water on the moss-covered rocks, so he crawled towards the rocks. With such severe injuries, could he crawl up? Difficulties could not frighten the heroic sailor. He crawled a bit, rested a bit, and finally found a small pocket of water. But this small pocket of water was gone after a few sips. Look again! He crawled towards another rock. This Mai Xiande-like hero, under the care of his comrades, with astonishing willpower, fought against pain, hunger, and cold for three days and two nights. Later, with the help of the Vietnamese people, he finally returned to the embrace of his motherland.

When Huang Bu San was sent to a certain army hospital in Guangzhou for treatment, his wounds were seriously infected. The hospital decided to perform a craniotomy on him. Before the operation, the doctor asked for his opinion, and he said, "I will do as the Party says. I only have one thought, which is to get the injury healed as soon as possible and return to serve the people."

The craniotomy began. Removing the bone fragments hidden deep in the brain was very difficult even for the doctors, but when asked, he said, "It doesn't hurt!" After the operation, the doctor brought him painkillers, but he said, "Comrade Mai Xiande was seriously injured on the head and still insisted on fighting. This little injury of mine is nothing." He asked the nurse to read Chairman Mao's quotations and tell the story of Ou Yanghai sacrificing himself to save the train, drawing spiritual strength from the struggle against pain. His right leg was pierced by a shrapnel, leaving a hole more than ten centimeters deep. During the dressing change, the cotton swab had to be inserted, and the skin trembled uncontrollably due to the stimulation of the medicine, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead, but he did not cry out in pain. He looked up at Chairman Mao's portrait without blinking and said, "Seeing Chairman Mao, I forget the pain."

Before his leg injury was completely healed, Huang Bu San got out of bed and practiced walking diligently. At first, the nurse came to support him, but he refused and insisted on practicing by himself. At this time, he recited, "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and exerted all his strength to straighten his back, finally taking a step. Because he insisted on practicing tenaciously, he was able to walk on the ground soon.

Now, Huang Bu San has recovered his health. When he left the hospital, he told the medical staff, "Without Chairman Mao, there would be no Huang Bu San. The Party gave me life and soul. In the hospital, I not only healed my injuries but, more importantly, I studied Mao Zedong Thought. I will definitely, as Chairman Mao taught, serve the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world with all my heart."

    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人骨头最硬
    ——记“南海英雄船”船长黄不三
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，有远大的革命理想，骨头最硬，战斗力最强。黄继光、王杰、麦贤得是这样，一○一八号货轮的船长、学习毛主席著作积极分子黄不三也是这样。
    他在敌机的枪炮面前，无所畏惧；在生死关头，想到的是革命的事业，想到的是毛主席。因此，人们称赞他是又一个“麦贤得”。
    去年八月二十九日，美国空中强盗突然袭击我国小型货轮一○一八号、一○一九号。黄不三一听到枪炮声就想：“为人民献身的时候到了。”他立即奔赴驾驶台。这时机关炮、火箭、炸弹像雨点般射下来，轰隆隆声震耳欲聋。
    黄不三这个贫苦渔民的儿子，十二岁起就给渔霸和日本帝国主义做工，受尽了剥削和压迫。今天，他面对敌人的轰炸、扫射，新仇旧恨一齐涌上心头。他只有一个信念：“战斗！坚决把船开往越南。”敌人的轰炸扫射，丝毫动摇不了黄不三的革命意志。他那仇恨的双眼凝视着前方，手里紧握车钟的把子，准确地摇着车钟，指挥着机器房的战友开出不同的车速，一次又一次避开了敌机的攻击。
    突然间，一枚火箭击中驾驶台，黄不三全身负伤三十五处。头部左额被炸开一个口子，颅骨碎了，右腿也受了重伤。他顿时晕倒在驾驶台上。
    敌人的炮弹可以损伤一个人的肉体，却炸毁不了英雄海员忠于毛泽东思想的红心。黄不三苏醒过来，说出的第一句话是：“二副，快开船！”他忍着周身的剧痛，以惊人的毅力站起来，带着满身鲜血，双手紧握舵轮，使出了最大的力气操舵。这时，马达声停止了，舵轮失灵了，船身急速下沉。战友们扶他上了救生筏，黄不三就又昏了过去。
    敌机在上空盘旋。昏迷状态的黄不三，一苏醒过来就叫着同志们的名字。护送他的许均瑞、熊耀章说：“船长，你放心。我们两人都是共产党员，有我们两个在，就有你在，我们一定把你送到岛上！”黄不三在战友们的护送下，终于登上一个荒岛。
    在岛上，黄不三面临着新的考验。尽管战友们把他隐蔽在一个岩洞里，把仅有的两件工作服盖在他身上，可是没有食物，创伤得不到治疗。不管情况多么严重，环境多么险恶，都吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄海员。黄不三想起了毛主席的教导：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”他想：困难再大，也没有红军长征时的困难大。只要有毛泽东思想，有阶级兄弟和自己在一起，天大的困难都可以克服。
    当照顾他的战友为他上山找野果时，黄不三发起高烧，这时他多么需要喝水呵！可是到哪里去找水呢？是等战友送来吗？不，不能！倔强的黄不三，两手撑地，双脚慢慢的向前移动。他每移动一步，受伤的四肢都像刀割一样疼痛。他凭过去的经验，估计在布满青苔的石头上会有存水，于是就向石头爬去。伤势这么重，能爬得上去吗？困难吓不倒英雄的船员。他爬一会儿，歇一会儿，最后终于找到了一小穴水。可是，这一小穴水喝不到几口就没有了。再找！他又爬向另一块石头。这个麦贤得式的英雄，在同志们照顾下，以惊人的毅力，与伤痛、饥饿、寒冷斗争了三天两夜，后来在越南人民帮助下，终于胜利地回到了祖国的怀抱。
    黄不三被送入广州某陆军医院治疗时，伤口严重感染。医院决定给他进行头部开颅手术。事前医生征求他的意见，他说：“党怎么说我就怎么做，我只有一个想法，就是把伤早点治好，尽快回去为人民服务。”
    头部开颅手术开始了。把藏在脑中几厘米深的碎骨片取出来，连医生都感到很费劲，可是问他，他却说：“不痛！”手术后，医生给他送去止痛药，他说：“麦贤得同志头负重伤，还坚持战斗，我这点伤算不了什么。”他要求护士给他念毛主席语录，讲欧阳海舍身抢救列车的故事，从中吸取和伤痛斗争的精神力量。他的右腿被弹片穿了一个十多厘米的洞。在换药时需要把棉条伸进去，加上药物的刺激，皮肉不停地颤抖，头上冒出豆大的汗珠，但是他不喊痛。他不眨眼地仰望着毛主席画像说：“看到了毛主席，我就忘记了痛了。”
    腿伤还没有完全好，黄不三就下地刻苦锻炼步行。起初，护士前来搀着他走，他不要搀，坚持自己锻炼。这时候，他一边念着：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一边使劲地挺起腰来，终于迈出了脚步。由于他顽强地坚持锻炼，很快就能下地走路了。
    现在，黄不三已经恢复了健康。他临出院时对医务人员说：“没有毛主席就没有我黄不三。是党给了我生命和灵魂。在医院，我不仅治好了伤，更重要的是学习了毛泽东思想。我一定要像毛主席教导的那样，全心全意为全国人民和全世界革命人民服务。”
