At a crucial moment in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when the struggle for power is intensifying, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued a battle cry to the entire army: The People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the leftists. This great call has expressed the hearts of all soldiers and officers in the army. All soldiers and officers in the army firmly support it and enthusiastically respond to it!

The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Harbin garrison have set a fine example by taking immediate action. At a critical moment when the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat were under attack by the so-called "Honor Restoration Army," a reactionary organization, they swiftly mobilized and surrounded the so-called "Honor Restoration Army," forcing a handful of reactionaries within the organization to surrender. This action has greatly suppressed the arrogance of the rightists and greatly boosted the morale of the leftists! It is truly heartening and excellent! Excellent!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage on their own."

Currently, the proletarian revolutionaries are uniting in large numbers and, with the momentum of a landslide, are launching a struggle for power. The lines have been clearly drawn, with the leftist forces growing stronger and the conservative forces crumbling. However, a small handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and a few stubborn elements who insist on the reactionary bourgeois line, are not willing to perish and are making desperate struggles. They are rallying the ghosts and snakes of society and reactionary organizations to launch a frenzied counterattack. In this great class struggle, our People's Liberation Army must stand firmly, hold high the banner, and resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary leftists. We must not, and cannot, stand in a so-called neutral position.

The action of the Harbin garrison unit in aiding the revolutionary leftists has powerfully defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and actively supported the proletarian revolutionary rebels in their struggle for power. They have fulfilled their glorious duty as the people's army.

Currently, the class struggle is extremely complex. Most of the people in some reactionary organizations are deceived. When our army takes action, it mainly engages in political work to awaken those who have been deceived, thereby dissolving reactionary organizations and striking at the ringleaders. After surrounding the so-called "Honor Restoration Army," the Harbin garrison unit first launched a political offensive, awakening the broad masses who had been deceived. The scene of the counter-revolutionary incident turned into a meeting to denounce the counter-revolutionaries. Those who had been deceived handed over their leaders, and the so-called "Honor Restoration Army" quickly disintegrated. In this way, they struck at a small number of counter-revolutionaries and won over those who had been deceived. What they did is completely correct! Completely correct!

Our army is the revolutionary army of the proletariat created by Chairman Mao. It is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the past, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, we used the gun to seize power from the reactionary Kuomintang. Now, some places and departments have had their leadership usurped by a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. The broad revolutionary leftists have risen up in unison to seize back the party power, state power, and economic power that have been usurped. In this sharp and intense struggle for power, our People's Liberation Army must make important contributions and achieve new victories for the socialist cause. Whenever the true proletarian revolutionaries ask us to aid them, we must immediately mobilize and provide full support.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, let us unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought! Fight together! Victory together!

Defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

　　用实际行动全力支援无产阶级革命派
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的关键时刻，我们的伟大统帅毛主席向全军发出了战斗号召：人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众。这个伟大号召，说出了全军同志的心里话。全军指战员最坚决地拥护，最热烈地响应！
    哈尔滨驻军某部指战员闻风而动，首先作出了榜样。他们在无产阶级革命左派遭到所谓“荣复军”这个反动组织围攻的紧要关头，一声令下立即出动，对所谓“荣复军”来了一个反包围，迫使所谓“荣复军”组织中的一小撮反动分子投降。这一行动大大地灭了右派的威风，大大地长了左派的志气！真是大快人心，好得很！好得很！
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”
    当前，无产阶级的革命派正在大联合，以排山倒海之势展开夺权斗争，阵线已经分明，左派队伍日益壮大，保守派正在全线崩溃。但是，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，并不甘心灭亡，还在作垂死挣扎。他们纠合社会上的牛鬼蛇神和反动组织进行疯狂反扑。在这场阶级大搏斗中，我们人民解放军应该立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决站在无产阶级革命左派一边，决不应该、也不可能站在所谓中立的地位。
    哈尔滨驻军某部援助革命左派的行动，有力地保卫了无产阶级文化大革命，保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，积极地支持了无产阶级革命造反派的夺权斗争，履行了我们人民军队的光荣职责。
    目前，阶级斗争极端复杂。一些反动组织中的大多数人是受蒙蔽的。我军在采取行动的时候，主要是进行政治工作，使受蒙蔽的人觉醒起来，以瓦解反动组织，打击首恶分子。哈尔滨驻军某部在包围所谓“荣复军”以后，首先发动了政治攻势，使广大受蒙蔽的人觉悟过来，反革命肇事的现场，变成控诉反革命分子的大会。受蒙蔽的人们交出了头头，所谓“荣复军”很快就溃散了。这样，既打击了极少数的反革命分子，又争取了受蒙蔽的人们。他们这样做是完全对的！完全正确的！
    我军是毛主席亲手缔造的无产阶级的革命军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石。过去，我们在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，用枪杆子从蒋介石反动派手里夺取了政权。现在，我们的一些地方、一些部门，被一小撮反革命修正主义分子窃取了领导权，广大革命左派一致奋起，要把被窃取的党权、政权、财权统统夺回来。在这场尖锐激烈的夺权斗争中，我们人民军队要作出重要贡献，要为社会主义事业立新功。凡是真正的无产阶级革命派要求我军去援助他们，我们就要立即出动，全力支援。
    无产阶级革命造反派的战友们，让我们在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，团结在一起！战斗在一起！胜利在一起！
    保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
