Tianjin workers, by studying and applying Chairman Mao's teachings on frugality in all undertakings, made significant achievements in saving timber in 1966, saving a total of 110,000 cubic meters.

The workers of Tianjin's timber supply department, following Chairman Mao's instructions on frugality in all undertakings, ensured that high-quality timber was used in the most important and necessary places. They fully utilized low-quality timber, making the most of every resource to better serve socialist construction. They decided to change the past practice of only supplying timber without considering its use, and instead assisted users in saving timber. Timber supply units across the city sent service teams to factories and rural areas to participate in labor and help users rationally use timber. A service team member discovered that a production unit was using high-quality timber inefficiently, with a large number of short pieces accumulating. The team member actively suggested to the workers and personally participated in experiments to glue the short pieces together, turning them into long pieces, significantly improving the utilization rate of timber and saving a large amount of high-quality timber. The service team also addressed the issue of some units having surplus timber due to mismatched varieties and specifications by establishing a "timber bank," similar to the savings method of the People's Bank, to store and distribute timber for various units, creating conditions for mutual adjustment and exchange of timber varieties. In 1966, the "timber banks" adjusted a total of 6,400 cubic meters of timber.

The spirit of Dr. Norman Bethune's dedication to precision in work inspired the workers of the timber supply department. They brainstormed and assisted workers in technological innovation and revolution, using low-quality materials to replace high-quality ones and substitutes to replace timber. Many factories and enterprises, with the help of service team members, launched a campaign to save timber. Some used split wood to replace high-quality timber to make wood fiber electric insulation boards; others used bamboo slices to replace high-quality timber to make filter presses, and so on. Over 120 factories in the city had wood pattern workers who, through various technical measures, "treated" rotten wood to make it function like high-quality timber. They used processed rotten birch wood to replace red pine, making tens of thousands of mechanical wood pattern parts, saving the country a large amount of high-quality timber. Workers in the basic construction sector used small-sized mixed square timber to make roof trusses and used short, inferior, and small materials to make grid-style roofs, building houses.

The workers of Tianjin's timber supply department, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "saving every copper coin," brought their own tools, went deep into user units, and carried out services to repair and reuse old items, making old items look new. They repaired broken furniture for many offices and enterprises, and users were very satisfied.

    遵循毛主席关于勤俭办一切事业的教导
    天津职工去年节约木材十一万立方米
    据新华社天津电　天津市木材供应部门和工厂企业职工，活学活用“老三篇”，全心全意为社会主义建设事业服务，在节约木材方面作出了很大成绩，一九六六年全市节约木材十一万多立方米。
    天津市木材供应部门的职工，遵循毛主席关于勤俭办一切事业的教导，把优质木材用到最重要、最需要的地方，同时充分利用劣质木材，做到物尽其用，更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。他们决心改变过去在木材供应工作中只管供，不管用的经营作风，协助使用单位节约木材。全市各木材供应单位的服务队员下厂下乡，参加劳动，协助用户合理使用木材。有一位服务队员发现一个生产单位所用的优质木材利用率很低，积压了大批短材，就积极向工人建议，并亲自参加粘接短材的试验，把短材粘接成长材，大大提高了木材的利用率，节约了大量优质木材。服务队员还针对有些单位由于供应的木材品种、规格不对路而造成积压的情况，仿效人民银行储蓄的方法，创办了“木材银行”，代企业存材，有存有取，为各单位互相调剂木材，串换品种创造了条件。一九六六年，各“木材银行”就调剂木材六千四百多立方米。
    白求恩同志对工作精益求精的精神，鼓舞了木材供应部门的职工。他们开动脑筋，协助工人通过技术革新、技术革命，用劣材代优材，用代用品代木材。许多工厂企业在服务队员的协助下，掀起了节约木材的热潮。有的用劈材代替优质木材制成木纤维电隔板；有的用竹片代替优质木材作成压滤板，等等。全市一百二十多个工厂的木型工人通过各种技术措施，给朽木“治病”，使它发挥优质木材的作用。他们用加工后的腐朽桦木代替红松，制作出上万件机械木型部件，为国家节约了大量优质木材。基本建设部门的职工，利用小规格的杂木方材，做成了屋架，利用短、次、小材做成网格式屋顶，盖成了房屋。
    天津市木材供应部门广大职工，遵循毛主席关于“节省每一个铜板”的教导，自带工具，深入用户，开展修旧利废、整旧如新的服务工作，为许多机关企业修理破旧家具。用户反应很好。
