This is not only of great significance in the economy, but also of great significance in politics.” The broad masses of workers in the Northeast power industry system have followed Chairman Mao’s instructions, extensively and deeply carried out the increased production and economy movement with saving coal and electricity as the center, and in 1966 saved the country more than 700,000 tons of coal.

    东北电业系统去年节煤七十多万吨
    据新华社沈阳六日电　我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“……要实行增产节约，反对铺张浪费。这不但在经济上有重大意义，在政治上也有重大意义。”东北电力工业系统广大职工遵循毛主席的教导，广泛深入地开展了以省煤节电为中心的增产节约运动，一九六六年为国家节约煤炭七十多万吨。据统计，全区火力发电厂一九六六年平均每供一度电所消耗的煤炭，比一九六五年降低了二十八克，这是近几年来煤耗降低幅度最大的一年。
