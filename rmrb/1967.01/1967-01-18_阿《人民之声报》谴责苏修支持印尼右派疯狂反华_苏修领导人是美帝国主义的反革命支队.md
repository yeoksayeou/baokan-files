Albanian "People's Voice" Newspaper Condemns Soviet Revisionists for Supporting Indonesian Rightists' Frenzied Anti-China Campaign
Soviet Revisionist Leaders Are the Counterrevolutionary Brigade of U.S. Imperialism

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana, on the 10th, the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an article titled "Khrushchev Revisionists Are Supporters and Close Friends of the Indonesian Reactionaries." The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leaders have degenerated into a counterrevolutionary brigade that serves the policies of imperialism and reactionaries of various countries.

The article states that the agreement currently being reached between the Brezhnev-Kosygin revisionist clique and the Suharto-Nasution criminal clique, as well as the Khrushchev revisionists' efforts to propagate that the Indonesian fascist regime is a force "against imperialism" and "against colonialism," once again confirms that the Soviet revisionist leadership, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, has participated in the plot by Indonesian right-wing forces to seize power. There is no doubt that the coup and the terrorist regime launched by the Indonesian reactionaries were supported by U.S. imperialism and encouraged by the Khrushchev revisionists. Similarly, if the United States and the Khrushchev revisionists do not provide political and material support to the Indonesian reactionaries, the Indonesian reactionaries will not be able to stand.

The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership's "selfless" aid to the Indonesian fascist regime goes far beyond the goal of stabilizing and consolidating the Indonesian reactionaries. The rapprochement and cooperation between Indonesia and the Soviet Union are a despicable act of imperialism and revisionism against the liberation struggles of the peoples of Asia, especially against the People's Republic of China.

The close political, economic, and military relations between Moscow and Jakarta are inseparable from the imperialist aggression against Vietnam and the imperialist-revisionist organization of the "encirclement" against the people of China.

The article concludes by saying that the close cooperation between the Soviet revisionist leaders and the Indonesian fascist military regime indicates that the Soviet revisionist leadership is a friend of the executioners of Indonesian patriots, a friend of imperialism and reactionaries, and an enemy of socialism.

    阿《人民之声报》谴责苏修支持印尼右派疯狂反华
    苏修领导人是美帝国主义的反革命支队
    据新华社地拉那电  阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十日发表题为《赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是印度尼西亚反动派的支持者和亲密朋友》的文章指出，苏联修正主义领导人已经堕落成为彻头彻尾地为帝国主义和各国反动派的政策效劳的反革命支队。
    文章说，勃列日涅夫—柯西金修正主义集团和苏哈托—纳苏蒂安罪恶集团之间目前正在达成的协议，以及赫鲁晓夫修正主义者竭力宣扬印尼法西斯政权是“反对帝国主义”、“反对殖民主义”力量，再一次证实苏联修正主义领导集团伙同美帝国主义，参与了印尼右派势力夺取政权的阴谋。毫无疑问，印尼反动派发动的政变和建立的恐怖制度是得到美帝国主义支持和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者鼓励的。同样，如果美国和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不对印尼反动派提供政治和物质上的支持，印尼反动派就站不住脚。
    文章指出，苏联修正主义领导集团“无私”援助印尼法西斯政权的目的远远超过稳定和巩固印尼反动派的目的。印尼和苏联靠拢与合作是帝国主义修正主义反对亚洲各国人民的解放斗争、特别是反对中华人民共和国的卑鄙勾当。
    莫斯科和雅加达之间的政治、经济和军事的密切关系，是和帝国主义侵略越南、帝国主义—修正主义组织反对人民中国的“火力包围”分不开的。
    文章最后说，苏联修正主义领导人和印尼法西斯军人政权的密切合作表明，苏联修正主义领导集团是屠杀印尼爱国者的刽子手的朋友，是帝国主义和反动派的朋友，是社会主义的敌人。
