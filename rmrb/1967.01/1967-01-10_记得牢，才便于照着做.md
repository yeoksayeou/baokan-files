Once, I participated in a labor activity to repair rice paddy dikes. I was not feeling well, worked slowly, and the quality of my work was poor. At the time, the platoon leader did not know I was working while sick, and he criticized me a few times. I immediately argued back with him.

After work, I felt that my attitude was wrong, so I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism. When I saw Chairman Mao's instructions: "The speaker is without guilt, the listener takes warning," and "If there is a problem, correct it; if there is none, strive harder," I felt very regretful. I thought: Although the platoon leader, due to insufficient investigation and research, criticized me in an unobjective manner, he did so to improve the work and take responsibility for the Party's cause. I did not explain the situation to him but instead argued back, which was wrong.

After that incident, I firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism and memorized the relevant quotes. Soon, the platoon held a discussion meeting. Some comrades' speeches inspired me, so I wrote them down on a piece of paper. The deputy platoon leader, who was leading the discussion, saw me writing and thought of my past habit of doodling during meetings and not paying attention to the lectures, so he criticized me. At that moment, my fellow comrades thought I would argue back with the deputy platoon leader. However, to their surprise, I not only did not get angry but also did not explain myself. Instead, I stood up and checked myself in front of the entire platoon for indeed having the habit of doodling during meetings in the past.

Why did I have such a change? Originally, when the deputy platoon leader started criticizing me, I also felt a bit angry. However, the Chairman Mao's quotes that I had memorized immediately came to my mind and suppressed the anger that had just risen. I thought, although I did not doodle this time, I indeed had this habit in the past. The deputy platoon leader's criticism served as a warning bell for me, and I would not make the same mistake in the future. Later, the deputy platoon leader clarified the situation, made self-criticism, and praised me.

These two different attitudes and results towards criticism made me realize: To have correct actions, one must have correct thoughts, which is Mao Zedong Thought. Only by firmly remembering Chairman Mao's teachings can one immediately apply them when encountering problems.

How can one firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings? An important method is to read and memorize Chairman Mao's quotes, memorize Chairman Mao's words, and imprint them in one's mind for timely application.

Now, I have memorized over sixty of Chairman Mao's quotes and have achieved good results in transforming my thoughts and guiding my actions.

    记得牢，才便于照着做
    战士　刘景全
    有一次参加修稻田埂的劳动，我身体不大舒服，修的慢，质量也差。当时班长并不知道我是带病坚持劳动的，他批评了我几句，我当场就和他顶撞起来。
    收工以后，我觉得自己的态度有问题，就学习了毛主席关于批评和自我批评的论述。当我看到毛主席教导的“言者无罪，闻者足戒”，“有则改之，无则加勉”时，很后悔。心想：班长虽然因为调查研究不够，对我的批评不够实事求是，但是他是为了把工作搞好，是对党的事业负责。我不向他讲明情况，反而和他顶撞，这是不对的。
    从那次以后，我就牢记毛主席关于批评和自我批评的教导，把有关的语录背了下来。不久，班里开讨论会，有些同志的发言对我很有启发，我就记在一张纸上。当时领导讨论会的副班长，看我在纸上写，联想到我过去开会时爱写爱画、不大注意听讲的毛病，就批评了我。这时我旁边的同志估计我又要和副班长顶撞起来。结果完全出乎他们的预料，我不但没有冒火，也没有解释，反而站起来向全班同志检查了自己以前确实存在开会时乱写乱画的毛病。
    我为什么有了这样的转变？原来，这次副班长开始批评我的时候，我也有些冒火，但是背熟了的毛主席语录，立刻在脑海里出现，把刚刚升起的火气一下压了下去。我想，这次自己虽然没有乱写乱画，但以前确实有这个毛病，副班长的批评给我敲一次警钟，今后就可能不再犯了。后来，副班长把情况弄清了，他做了自我批评，还表扬了我。
    这两次对待批评的不同态度和不同结果，使我认识到：要有正确的行动，必须有正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想；只有牢记毛主席的教导，遇到问题才能立刻用得上。
    怎样才能牢记毛主席的教导呢？一个重要的办法就是熟读熟记毛主席语录，把毛主席的话背下来，印在脑子里，随时应用。
    现在，我已经背熟了六十多条毛主席语录；在改造思想、指导行动方面，收到了较好的效果。
