The "Anti-Imperialist Cartoon Exhibition of Asian and African Peoples," which has been warmly received by the audience, has successfully concluded after two extensions of its exhibition period. During the 40-day exhibition, over 1.1 million Red Guards from the capital and various parts of the country, revolutionary masses from all walks of life, and foreign friends in Beijing visited the exhibition.

The audience highly praised this exhibition, organized by the Secretariat of the Asian and African Journalists' Association, deeming it a brilliant exhibition illuminated by the great thoughts of Chairman Mao. It reflects the high spirits of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism among the revolutionary peoples and artists of Asia and Africa, greatly boosting the fighting will of the revolutionary masses.

International friends from over 40 countries and regions in Beijing visited the exhibition. After the visit, they enthusiastically shouted in different languages, "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" They believe that the Anti-Imperialist Cartoon Exhibition of Asian and African Peoples is another victory of Mao Zedong Thought. From the exhibition, they saw how people from various countries in the world grasp Mao Zedong Thought. The exhibition strengthened their confidence to fight to the end for the world proletarian revolutionary cause. A foreign friend wrote in the comment book: "The day Asian and African revolutionary peoples grasp Mao Zedong Thought will be the doomsday of imperialism."

The exhibited works reflecting the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the Asian and African peoples left a deep impression on the foreign friends. They praised the exhibition for reflecting the Chinese people's and people from all countries' struggle against their common enemy—the U.S. imperialism, showcasing the fighting unity of the Asian and African peoples against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism. After visiting the exhibition, foreign friends once again enthusiastically praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which shook the world, was personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and it was the first of its kind in world history. The exhibited cartoons related to the Chinese Cultural Revolution greatly inspired them, pointing out the truth that the old society is bound to perish to the people of the world.

    一百多万人参观亚非反帝漫画展览
    据新华社四日讯　受到观众热烈欢迎的“亚非人民反帝漫画展览”，经过两次延长展期，已在今天胜利闭幕。在四十天的展出期间，首都和全国各地红卫兵、各界革命群众，以及在京的外国朋友，共一百一十万人前去参观。
    观众高度评价了这个由亚非记协书记处举办的展览，认为这是一次闪耀着伟大的毛泽东思想光辉的展览，它反映了亚非革命人民和革命画家高昂的反帝反修的战斗精神，大大鼓舞了革命人民的战斗意志。
    在北京的包括四十多个国家和地区的国际友人参观了展览。他们在参观后用不同的语言热烈欢呼“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”他们认为，亚非人民反帝漫画展览是毛泽东思想的又一胜利，从展览会上看到了世界各国人民是怎样掌握毛泽东思想的。看过展览增强了他们为世界无产阶级革命斗争到底的信心。一位外国朋友在留言笺上写道：“亚非革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想之日，则也是帝国主义的末日。”
    展出的反映亚非人民反帝反修的作品，给外国朋友留下了深刻的印象。他们赞扬展览反映了中国人民和世界各国人民反对共同敌人——美帝国主义的斗争，显示了亚非人民反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的战斗团结。外国朋友们看过展览，再一次热烈称颂我国的无产阶级文化大革命。他们说，震撼世界的中国文化大革命，是毛主席亲自发起和领导的，在世界历史上还是第一次。展出的有关以中国文化大革命为题材的漫画，给了他们极大的鼓舞，给全世界人民指出了旧社会必定灭亡的真理。
