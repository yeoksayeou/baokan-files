	Beacon on the Path
	Professor Inoue Kiyoshi, Kyoto University, Japan
	Chairman Mao's speech three years ago, "In Support of the Anti-U.S. Patriotic Struggle of the Japanese People," serves as a beacon guiding the Japanese people's anti-U.S. patriotic movement forward.

	The victorious trend of the struggles of the people of the world and the development of history have proven the complete correctness of Chairman Mao's judgments.

	Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." This is an expression of Chairman Mao's boundless trust and great encouragement to the Japanese people. Chairman Mao has strengthened our confidence in winning victory.

	U.S. imperialism is still occupying Japan, still expanding the flames of war in Vietnam, and still doing everything it can to strengthen the "containment" of China. Modern revisionists shout slogans of "supporting Vietnam" and "Japan-China friendship," but in practice, they have become accomplices of U.S. imperialism in carrying out its policy of aggression and war.

	We must adhere to the principle that to oppose U.S. imperialism is to oppose revisionism. These two are closely linked. We must strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism and also strengthen the struggle against modern revisionism.

	Chairman Mao's remarks on the Japanese question are all correct conclusions drawn from the objective situation in Japan. The brilliance of Chairman Mao's thought will shine more brightly with the development of the Japanese people's struggle. Every word of Chairman Mao will increasingly demonstrate boundless vitality and great significance. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　指路的明灯
　　日本京都大学教授　井上清
    毛主席三年前发表的《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》是指导日本人民反美爱国运动前进的指路明灯。
    全世界人民斗争的胜利形势和历史发展，证明了毛主席的论断的完全正确。
    毛主席指出：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”这是对日本人民的无限信赖和巨大鼓舞。毛主席坚定了我们争取胜利的信心。
    美帝国主义还侵占着日本，还在越南不断地扩大战火，还千方百计地加强“遏制”中国。现代修正主义者口头上叫嚷“支援越南”、“日中友好”，而在行动上完全变成了美帝国主义推行侵略、战争政策的帮凶。
    我们必须坚持反对美帝国主义就必须反对修正主义的原则，这两者是紧密联系在一起的。既要加强反对美帝国主义的斗争，又要加强反对现代修正主义的斗争。
    毛主席关于日本问题的谈话，都是从日本的客观形势出发而做出的正确结论。毛主席思想的光辉将随着日本人民斗争的发展，在日本日益放射出灿烂光芒，毛主席的每句话，都将日益表现出无限生命力和巨大意义。（据新华社讯）
