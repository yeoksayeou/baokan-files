The Albanian "People's Voice" newspaper published a commentary on January 13, pointing out that President Johnson's State of the Union address on January 10 is a confession of his aggressive and war-mongering policies, once again exposing U.S. imperialism as the main enemy of the peoples of all countries.

The commentary pointed out that Johnson raised two main issues in his address: the escalation of the war in Vietnam and the intensification of U.S. imperialism's efforts to collaborate with the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries. Johnson asked Congress to approve a military budget that breaks the record for peacetime spending, with most of it allocated to escalating the war in Vietnam. Johnson expressed satisfaction with many agreements already reached between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and called for further collaboration with the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries. He asked Congress to approve the U.S.-Soviet consular agreement as an important step in strengthening U.S.-Soviet relations. All of this shows that U.S.-Soviet collusion remains an important goal pursued by the U.S. government.

According to a report from New China News Agency, the Secretary-General of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, Itabe Masao, told the Oriental News Agency that Johnson's State of the Union address fully demonstrates that U.S. imperialism intends to further escalate the war in Vietnam.

In his remarks, Itabe condemned the Japanese followers of Soviet modern revisionism for advocating the so-called "united action," calling it a betrayal of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world, saying, "It will only help U.S. imperialism."

Fukuda Masayoshi, a prominent figure from Yamaguchi Prefecture, pointed out in his remarks that it is obvious that Johnson's State of the Union address is a blueprint for U.S. imperialism's expansion of aggression. Although U.S. imperialism continues to play both the war and "peace" cards, the anti-U.S. struggle of the people of the world will only intensify, and all of Johnson's tricks will surely fail.

According to a report from New China News Agency on January 14, some bourgeois newspapers in countries including the United States commented on Johnson's State of the Union address delivered a few days ago, pointing out that the address was "gloomy in tone" and "full of worries."

The January 12 issue of the U.S. "New York Herald Tribune" acknowledged dejectedly that Johnson's address was "the most gloomy in many years." The commentary wrote: "If there was any doubt before, Johnson has now solemnly declared in his State of the Union address the prospect of (aggressing) Vietnam: 'Continue to pay the price, continue to suffer losses, continue to suffer pain.'"

The "New York Times" published editorials on January 12 and 13, pointing out that Johnson's tone on the Vietnam issue was "almost pessimistic and gloomy." He hoped for a "peace with victory" in Vietnam, which was beyond his reach.

The Japanese "Economic News" said, "The biggest worry expressed in the State of the Union address is how to handle the Vietnam War." The "Asahi Shimbun" also said, "This year's State of the Union address is even more gloomy in tone than last year's."

The West German "Welt" pointed out that Johnson's address shows that he is "in a passive position in all respects," and his helplessness in diplomacy "has never been so obvious."

Many commentaries pointed out the series of problems that the Vietnam War has brought to Johnson at home, and pointed out that the tax increase measures announced by Johnson will further worsen the economic situation in the United States.

    阿《人民之声报》谴责美帝加紧同苏修集团勾结
    约翰逊国情咨文是侵略政策的自供状
    日本公众说约翰逊咨文表明美帝妄图进一步扩大侵越战争
    据新华社地拉那电  阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》十三日发表评论指出，约翰逊一月十日的国情咨文是侵略和战争政策的自供状，再次暴露了美帝国主义是各国人民的主要敌人。
    评论指出，约翰逊在咨文中提出了两个主要问题，即扩大侵越战争和加紧美帝国主义同苏联以及一些东欧国家间的搭桥活动。约翰逊要求国会批准打破和平时期纪录的军事预算，而其中大部分是用于扩大侵越战争。约翰逊对美苏已经达成的许多协议表示满意，并要求同苏联和一些东欧国家进一步勾结，要求国会批准美苏领事协议，作为加强美苏关系的一个重要步骤。所有这一切表明，美苏勾结仍然是美国政府所追求的重要目标。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：亚非人民团结委员会事务局长板井庄作向东方通讯社记者发表谈话指出，约翰逊的国情咨文充分地表明了美帝国主义还要进一步扩大侵越战争。
    板井在谈话中谴责苏联现代修正主义在日本的追随者鼓吹的所谓“联合行动”的荒谬主张。他说：“这是对越南人民和世界革命人民的背叛，它只会帮助美帝国主义。”
    山口县知名人士福田正义在谈话中指出，显而易见，约翰逊的国情咨文，是美帝国主义扩大侵略的计划书。尽管美帝国主义继续玩弄战争与“和平”的两手政策，但是，全世界人民的反美斗争必将日益加强，约翰逊的一切阴谋诡计都必将遭到失败。
    据新华社十四日讯包括美国在内的一些国家的资产阶级报刊在评论约翰逊几天前发表的国情咨文时纷纷指出，咨文“语调阴郁”，“充满了苦恼”。
    美国《纽约先驱论坛报》十二日沮丧地承认，约翰逊的咨文，“是多年来最忧郁的”。评论写道：“如果过去还有什么怀疑的话，那么约翰逊在国情咨文中已经郑重地表明了（侵略）越南的前景：‘继续付出代价，继续遭受损失，继续遭受痛苦’。”
    《纽约时报》十二日和十三日接连发表社论指出，约翰逊在谈到越南问题时的语气“带有一种接近于悲观的阴郁语调”。他希望在越南取得的“伴随着（军事）胜利的和平，是他的力量所达不到的”。
    日本《经济新闻》说，“在国情咨文中表现出来的美国的最大苦恼是怎样处理越南战争问题。”《朝日新闻》也说：“今年的国情咨文比去年苦恼的色彩更加深了”。
    西德《世界报》指出，约翰逊的咨文表明，他“在各方面都处于被动”，他在外交方面的毫无办法“还从来没有变得如此明显”。
    许多评论都指出侵越战争在国内给约翰逊带来的一连串难题，指出约翰逊宣布的增税措施将会使美国经济情况进一步恶化。
