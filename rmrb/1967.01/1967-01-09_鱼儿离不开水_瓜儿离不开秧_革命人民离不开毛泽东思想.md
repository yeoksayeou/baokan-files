	The enemy opposes Mao Zedong Thought, so we must study Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever the enemy opposes, we must support.

	The light of Mao Zedong Thought will illuminate the earth. This is a historical fact. No matter how the enemy curses, Mao Zedong Thought has great vitality. Mao Zedong Thought is like a dagger, piercing the enemy's heart.
