Title: The Quote is Well Given

One Saturday evening, I returned from watching a movie in town and found a new quote placed next to my bed's quote board: “...Caring for the Party and the masses is more important than caring for oneself; caring for others is more important than caring for oneself. Only then can one be considered a Communist Party member.” I immediately understood: this was a critique of my going to watch movies for two consecutive weekends without considering the rest of my comrades. Upon reflection, I realized I indeed had this flaw—always putting myself first in any situation. This quote is well given! I neatly pasted it on my bed's quote board and used it to reflect and criticize my selfish thoughts every day.

Soon, a film crew was sent by higher authorities to screen a new movie. Everyone was excited. However, during the screening, someone had to be left to work on duty. Who should it be? At this moment, I remembered the quote given to me by my comrades, and I gave up the idea of watching the movie. I volunteered to be on duty. After finishing my work, the movie had only been shown halfway. I was just about to go watch it when I thought of the comrades on duty. I went to replace the sentry, allowing him to watch the second half of the movie. After the movie ended, it was time for the next shift, but the comrade who was supposed to relieve me did not come. I felt a bit upset. This emotion surfaced, but I immediately heard Chairman Mao’s teaching: “Caring for others is more important than caring for oneself.” I thought: caring for others more than oneself means to unconditionally and limitlessly help others. The comrade who was supposed to relieve me must have had a special reason for not coming on time. So, I happily stood the next shift for my comrade.

    这条语录送得好
    宗成义
    一个星期六晚上，我从镇上看电影回来，发现自己的床头语录板旁放着一条新语录：“……关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。”我一看就明白了：这是批评我两个周末连着出去看电影，不照顾别的同志休息。仔细一检查，自己就是有这个缺点，一事当前先替自己打算。这条语录送得好！于是，我把它端端正正地贴在床头语录板上，天天对照检查，狠斗私心。
    不久，上级派来了电影队，放映一部新影片，同志们都很高兴。可是放映时还要留人值班工作。留谁呢？这时，我想起了同志们送给我的那条毛主席语录，便打消了看电影的念头，主动担任值班。工作完了，电影才放映了一半，我刚要去看电影，想到阵地上还有站岗的同志，就又去替哨兵站岗，让他快去看后半场电影。电影放映完了，换岗的时间也到了，可是值下班岗的同志却没有来，自己就有点不高兴了。这种情绪刚一露头，耳边又响起毛主席“关心他人比关心自己为重”的教导来。我想：关心他人比关心自己为重，就是要无条件、无限度地去利人。接岗的同志没有按时来，一定有特殊原因。于是，我又愉快地替同志站下一班岗。
