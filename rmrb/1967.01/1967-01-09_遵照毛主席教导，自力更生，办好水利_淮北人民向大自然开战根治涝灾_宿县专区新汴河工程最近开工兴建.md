Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the people of Huabei are fighting against nature to eliminate flood disasters. The new Shuihe project in Suzhou Prefecture recently began construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, January 8th: The water conservancy project to eliminate flood disasters in Suzhou Prefecture, Anhui Province—the new Shuihe project—has recently begun construction.

This project is a great feat of the broad masses of Huabei, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fighting against nature. The project's scope of treatment covers the Suihe and Zhaotonghe water systems, with a drainage area of 22,800 square kilometers, spanning 14 counties and cities across Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces. Among these, Suzhou Prefecture has 15,300 square kilometers, with 14 million mu of arable land. The new Shuihe project involves digging a new drainage channel starting from north of Suzhou City, passing through the Jingpu Railway, through Lingbi and Sizhou counties, and entering Hongze Lake in Suhong County, Jiangsu Province, with a total length of 127 kilometers. The entire channel will have many bridges, sluices, and underground culverts. The Tanghe and Shilianghe rivers will pass through underground culverts under the new Shuihe. The entire project is required to be completed within two years. Once this river is completed, it can intercept floodwaters from parts of Henan and Jiangsu provinces, channel them through the new Shuihe, and discharge them into Hongze Lake; the original local channels will drain local waterlogging. This way, the problem of frequent flooding in Huabei can be solved, and it will also be beneficial for drought resistance and the development of water transportation.

The Suzhou region is a low-lying, flood-prone old disaster area. After liberation, the broad masses of cadres and people here, following Chairman Mao's instructions of "water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture" and "the Huai River must be properly managed," carried out the great Huai River management project, developed agricultural water conservancy, dug drainage ditches and channels, built terraced fields and ridge fields, and built mechanical and electrical drainage stations, significantly improving water conservancy conditions. In the past two years, the broad masses of cadres and people in Huabei, with the question of how to change the face of multiple disasters and low yields, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. They, following Chairman Mao's instructions on grasping the main contradiction, conducted in-depth investigations and realized that the most harmful disaster is still waterlogging. This place is downstream of some rivers in Henan and Jiangsu provinces. Every year during the flood season, the upstream water is more, faster, and greater, occupying the drainage channels first. Thus, local accumulated water cannot be drained, causing waterlogging. Based on this situation and local and external provincial experiences, the main solution to the threat of floods and waterlogging is to find an outlet for upstream floods and implement flood and waterlogging separation. Therefore, it was decided to dig the new Shuihe to ensure that floodwaters can be discharged into Hongze Lake in a timely manner.

The construction of the new Shuihe project is carried out following Chairman Mao's instructions on self-reliance. The state has provided some funds, and the rest is self-raised. The community members say, "The state has many construction projects. We must rely on our own hands to dig the river and cannot rely on the state."

    遵照毛主席教导，自力更生，办好水利
    淮北人民向大自然开战根治涝灾
    宿县专区新汴河工程最近开工兴建
    新华社合肥八日电  安徽省宿县专区根治洪涝灾害的水利工程——新汴河工程，最近开工兴建。
    这个工程是淮北广大群众用毛泽东思想武装起来，向大自然开战的一个壮举。工程治理范围涉及濉河、漴潼河两大水系，流域面积二万二千八百多平方公里，地跨河南、安徽、江苏三省十四个县市。其中宿县专区有一万五千三百平方公里，耕地一千四百多万亩。新汴河工程是新挖一条排洪河道，从宿县城北开始，穿过津浦铁路，经灵璧、泗县，到江苏泗洪县入洪泽湖，全长一百二十七公里。整个河道要修建很多桥闸和地下涵洞。唐河、石梁河等河流将在新汴河底下的涵洞穿过。整个工程要求在两年内完成。这条河修成后，可以把河南、江苏部分地区来的洪水截住，流经新汴河，泄入洪泽湖；本地区原有的河道排除本地区的内涝。这样就可以解决淮北易涝的问题，并有利于抗旱和发展水上交通。
    宿县地区是个低洼易涝的老灾区。解放后，这里的广大干部和群众遵照毛主席的“水利是农业的命脉”和“一定要把淮河修好”的教导，进行了伟大的治淮工程，大办农田水利，大挖涌渠、河道，大修台田条田，兴建机电排涝站，水利条件有了很大的改善。近两年来，淮北广大干部和群众带着如何改变多灾低产面貌问题，活学活用毛主席著作。他们遵照毛主席关于抓住主要矛盾的教导，深入调查，认识到危害最大的还是水灾。这里处于河南和江苏一些河道的下游，每年汛期上游来水多，来水快，水量大，首先抢占了排水河道，这样，当地的积水就无法排除，造成内涝。根据这种情况和本地、外省的经验，解决洪涝威胁的主要办法，是给上游洪水找一条出路，进行洪涝分治，因而决定开挖新汴河，保证洪水能及时向洪泽湖排泄。
    新汴河工程的兴建，是遵照毛主席关于自力更生的教导进行的，国家补助了一部分经费，其余都是自筹的。社员们说，国家建设项目多，我们要靠自己的双手来挖河，不能依赖国家。
