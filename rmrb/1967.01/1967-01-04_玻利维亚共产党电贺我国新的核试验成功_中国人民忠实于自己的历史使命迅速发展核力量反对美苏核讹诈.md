The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has received a cable from Daniel Campos, a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of Bolivia, congratulating China on its successful new nuclear explosion.

The cable says: The Chinese people, under the correct leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China and guided by the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved a new great victory in the field of nuclear power. The cable says: "The Chinese people have achieved great successes in scientific and technological research and nuclear testing. Their victories in socialist construction are an unprecedented guarantee for the realization of scientific socialism in the world and for the revolutionary future of the oppressed peoples of all countries.

"The imperialists and all reactionaries, including the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party leadership, are the mortal enemies of the Chinese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world. They are frantically trying to enslave all of humanity and redivide the world to satisfy their vile desires.

"But the vile schemes of the imperialists, who are in cahoots with the modern revisionists, and of various reactionaries will be defeated and smashed by the steadfast stance of the great Chinese people and revolutionaries of the world, who are armed with the scientific thought of Marxism-Leninism and guided by the brilliant sun of Mao Zedong Thought."

"The Chinese people, faithful to their historical mission of building scientific socialism and resolutely defending Marxism-Leninism, are rapidly advancing in the development of nuclear power, opposing the nuclear blackmail of the imperialist forces led by the United States and their Soviet revisionist accomplices, defending the socialist cause and true world peace. In other words, they are waging revolutionary war against counter-revolutionary war, rather than, as the modern revisionists shamelessly advocate, kneeling down to beg imperialism for peace."

In the final part of the cable, Daniel Campos, on behalf of the Communist Party of Bolivia, extends the warmest congratulations to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, scientists and technicians, workers, the People's Liberation Army, and all other people who have selflessly participated in this work. The cable says: "We wish you greater and more brilliant victories in our common cause of socialism and communism, and long life to Mao Zedong, the leader of the world revolution."

    玻利维亚共产党电贺我国新的核试验成功
    中国人民忠实于自己的历史使命迅速发展核力量反对美苏核讹诈
    新华社三日讯　中共中央收到了玻利维亚共产党书记处书记达涅尔·卡姆波斯发来的祝贺我国成功地进行新的核爆炸的电报。
    贺电说，中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的正确领导下，在毛泽东思想红旗指引下，在核力量方面又获得了新的伟大的胜利。贺电说：“中国人民在科学技术研究和核试验方面取得了伟大的成就。他们在社会主义建设方面取得的胜利，对在全世界实现科学社会主义，对各国被压迫人民的革命前途，是人类历史上一个空前的保证。
    “帝国主义和一切反动派，包括以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义者，是中国人民和全世界革命人民的死敌，他们疯狂地企图奴役全人类，重新瓜分世界来满足他们的卑鄙欲望。”
    “但是，同现代修正主义者狼狈为奸的帝国主义和形形色色的反动派的卑鄙图谋，必将被以马克思列宁主义科学思想武装起来的、在毛泽东思想红旗光辉太阳指导下的伟大的中国人民和全世界革命者的坚定立场所击败和粉碎。”
      “中国人民忠于自己建设科学社会主义和坚决保卫马克思列宁主义的历史使命，正在发展核力量方面快速前进，反对以美国为首的帝国主义势力及其苏联修正主义帮凶的核讹诈，保卫社会主义事业和真正的世界和平，也就是说，以革命战争反对反革命战争，而不是像现代修正主义者无耻地宣扬那样的跪着向帝国主义乞求和平。”
    达涅尔·卡姆波斯在贺电的最后以玻利维亚共产党的名义，向中共中央和中国政府、科学技术人员、工人、人民解放军和参加这项忘我工作的所有其他人表示最热烈的祝贺。电报说：“预祝你们在我们共同的社会主义和共产主义事业上取得更大的、辉煌的胜利，祝世界革命的领袖毛泽东同志长寿。”
