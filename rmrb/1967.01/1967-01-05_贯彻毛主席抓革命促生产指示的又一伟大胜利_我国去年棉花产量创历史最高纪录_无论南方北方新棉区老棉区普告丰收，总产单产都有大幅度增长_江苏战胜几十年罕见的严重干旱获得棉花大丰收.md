In 1966, under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of people and cadres in the cotton-growing areas of our country have studied Chairman Mao's works more deeply and advanced vigorously along the path of Mao Zedong Thought, achieving tremendous development in cotton production on the basis of four consecutive years of increased output. This has added a new chapter of glory to the history of cotton production in our country.

	According to materials provided by relevant departments, the total output and yield per unit area of cotton in 1966 were both significantly higher than the best harvest year in history, 1965, with the yield per unit area increasing even more. Whether in the southern or northern cotton-growing areas, or in old or new cotton-growing areas, there was a universally satisfactory harvest, with some regions achieving particularly notable increases. In Henan Province, many counties that previously had an average yield of 40-50 jin of lint cotton per mu increased to 70-80 jin or more in 1966; in the Xuzhou region of Jiangsu Province, some counties saw a doubling of output; in Henan, Hunan, Anhui, Sichuan, Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces, there were batches of counties with increases of 20-30% to 40-50%. In Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Hubei provinces, where the output was originally relatively high, the counties with an average yield of over 100 jin of lint cotton per mu all saw significant increases; there were batches of counties with an average yield of around 140 jin of lint cotton per mu. Counties with an average yield of over 150 jin of lint cotton per mu have emerged in large numbers in many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. All these facts powerfully demonstrate that cotton production in our country has entered a new stage of development.

	The significant increase in cotton production in 1966 is a great victory achieved by various places in seizing the revolution and promoting production under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. This year, the masses and cadres in the cotton-growing areas have further raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with unprecedented enthusiasm to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Constantly Read Articles," to break down selfishness and establish public spirit, continuously raising their socialist consciousness. They have become more conscious of linking the development of cotton production with supporting national construction and the world revolution. They are not afraid of hardship or difficulty; they dare to struggle and dare to win. They firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "In the cause of socialism, to want to avoid difficulties and twists and turns, to want to avoid paying tremendous efforts, and to want to achieve success smoothly and easily, such a way of thinking is merely a fantasy." Therefore, although the natural disasters faced by the southern and northern cotton-growing areas in 1966 were quite severe, and some regions were threatened by continuous natural disasters from sowing to harvest, the broad masses of people and cadres in the cotton-growing areas, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, were not frightened by the natural disasters. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings and fought bravely against the natural disasters.

	To achieve a bumper cotton harvest, over the past year, the southern and northern cotton-growing areas have, while vigorously promoting agricultural infrastructure construction, made tremendous efforts in reforming cotton cultivation techniques, with significant results. Various cotton-growing areas have universally taken rational dense planting as the center and launched a mass movement to reform cotton cultivation techniques. Therefore, the degree of dense planting has been universally increased; the area of improved varieties has developed to account for about 80% of the total cotton fields; fertilizer application and field management have also been improved on the original basis. Due to the high spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win exhibited by the broad masses of people and cadres, and the significant development of agricultural infrastructure construction and cotton cultivation techniques over the past year, the ability to resist disasters has been greatly enhanced. Therefore, although natural disasters were particularly frequent in 1966 and lasted for a long time, the growth of cotton in most cotton-growing areas was better than in any previous year. Thus, it was ensured that the total output and yield per unit area of cotton in 1966 both saw significant increases on the original basis.

	Over the past year, the broad masses of people and cadres in the cotton-growing areas of our country have achieved tremendous results in developing cotton production. The masses and cadres in various places are systematically summarizing their experiences and are determined to, in the new year, raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, in the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further seize the revolution and promote production, and develop cotton production even faster.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing on the 3rd, in 1966, the broad masses of commune members in the cotton-growing areas of Jiangsu Province studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, further carried forward the spirit of continuous revolution, overcame a severe drought that is rarely seen in decades, and achieved a bumper cotton harvest. By the end of November last year, the total amount of lint cotton purchased in the province was more than 20% higher than the total output of lint cotton in the previous year, and the yield per unit area was significantly higher than in 1965. Compared to normal years, the increase in total output and yield per unit area was even greater.

### 贯彻毛主席抓革命促生产指示的又一伟大胜利  我国去年棉花产量创历史最高纪录  无论南方北方新棉区老棉区普告丰收，总产单产都有大幅度增长  江苏战胜几十年罕见的严重干旱获得棉花大丰收

    贯彻毛主席抓革命促生产指示的又一伟大胜利
    我国去年棉花产量创历史最高纪录
    无论南方北方新棉区老棉区普告丰收，总产单产都有大幅度增长
    江苏战胜几十年罕见的严重干旱获得棉花大丰收
    据新华社三日讯　一九六六年，在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，我国棉区的广大群众和干部更深入地活学活用毛主席著作，意气风发地沿着毛泽东思想的轨道奋勇前进，使棉花生产在接连四年持续增产的基础上，又有巨大的发展，为我国棉花生产史上增添了新的光辉的一章。
    有关主管部门提供的资料表明，一九六六年我国棉花的总产量和单位面积产量，都比历史上收成最好的一九六五年又有大幅度的增长，其中单位面积产量增长幅度还更大一些。无论是南方棉区还是北方棉区，也无论是老棉区还是新棉区，都普遍获得了可喜的丰收，有的地区增产非常显著。河南省的不少原来平均亩产皮棉四五十斤的县，一九六六年一举增加到七八十斤甚至更多；江苏省徐州专区有些县增产一倍左右；增产二三成到四五成的县，河南、湖南、安徽、四川、河北、山东、山西等省都有一批。在浙江、上海、江苏、湖北等原来产量就较高的省、市，平均亩产皮棉百斤以上的县，都比过去又有很大的增加；有一批县平均亩产皮棉已高达一百四十斤左右。平均亩产皮棉达一百五十斤以上的公社和大队，已在许多省、市、自治区大量涌现。这些情况无不有力地说明，我国棉花生产已经进入一个新的发展阶段。
    一九六六年我国棉花大幅度增产，是各地在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，按照毛主席和党中央的指示，积极地抓革命、促生产的又一伟大的胜利。这一年，棉区群众和干部进一步高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以空前高涨的热情活学活用毛主席著作，特别是活学活用“老三篇”，大破私字，大立公字，社会主义觉悟不断提高。他们越来越自觉地把发展棉花生产和支援国家建设和世界革命联系起来。他们不怕艰苦，不怕困难；敢于斗争，敢于胜利。他们脑子里牢牢地记住毛主席的教导：“在社会主义事业中，要想不经过艰难曲折，不付出极大努力，总是一帆风顺，容易得到成功，这种想法，只是幻想。”所以，尽管一九六六年南北棉区遭到的自然灾害都是相当严重的，有一部分地区从播种到收获，一直处在连续袭来的自然灾害的威胁之中，但用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大棉区群众和干部没有被自然灾害吓倒，他们遵循毛主席的教导，英勇不屈地和自然灾害搏斗。
    为夺取棉花丰收，一年来南北棉区在大兴农田基本建设的同时，在改革植棉技术方面，作了巨大的努力，收效也很显著。各棉区普遍地以合理密植为中心，开展了群众性的植棉技术改革运动。因此，各地普遍加大了密植程度；良种面积已发展到占全部棉田的百分之八十左右；施肥和田间管理工作也在原有基础上又有新的提高。由于广大群众和干部高度发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，加上一年来农田基本建设和植棉技术都有很大发展，抗灾能力大大增强，所以尽管一九六六年自然灾害十分频繁，持续时间也较长，但绝大多数棉区棉花生长情况都比以往任何一年都好。这样，就保证了一九六六年棉花的总产量和单位面积产量，都在原有基础上又有大幅度的增长。
    一年来，我国棉区群众和干部在发展棉花生产方面取得的成就是巨大的。各地群众和干部正系统总结经验，决心在新的一年内，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮中，进一步抓革命、促生产，使棉花生产更快地向前发展。
    据新华社南京三日电一九六六年，江苏省各产棉区的广大社员活学活用毛主席著作，进一步发扬不断革命精神，战胜几十年罕见的严重干旱，获得了棉花大丰收。到去年十一月底，全省已收购的皮棉比上年度全省皮棉总产量还多两成以上，单位面积产量也显著地高于一九六五年。和常年相比，总产量和单位面积产量增长的幅度，还更大一些。
