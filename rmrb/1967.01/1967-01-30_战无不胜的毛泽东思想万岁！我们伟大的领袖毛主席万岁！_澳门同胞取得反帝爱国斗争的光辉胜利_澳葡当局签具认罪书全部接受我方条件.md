The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is long live! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!
Macao compatriots achieve a brilliant victory in their anti-imperialist, patriotic struggle
The Portuguese authorities in Macao sign a confession and accept all our conditions

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, January 29th. The Portuguese authorities in Macao today signed a confession regarding the "11.15" and "12.3" bloody incidents and a document implementing our conditions, fully accepting the four conditions proposed by the Director of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee's Foreign Affairs Office and the six demands of the Macao compatriots, taking full responsibility for the brutal massacre and persecution of Macao's Chinese residents. This is a brilliant victory achieved by the patriotic compatriots of Macao, who have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the resolute support of the vast people and Red Guards of the great socialist motherland and the powerful People's Liberation Army of China, in their two-month-long anti-imperialist, patriotic struggle.

In the confession handed over to the Macao compatriots, the Portuguese authorities in Macao admitted that they had committed "serious crimes" in the "11.15" and "12.3" bloody incidents and would "take full responsibility," punish the main culprits, compensate for all losses, and apologize to all Chinese residents in Macao. They also guaranteed the safety of life and property of Chinese residents in Macao and the protection of their legitimate rights. In the document implementing our conditions handed over to the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee's Foreign Affairs Office, the Portuguese authorities in Macao pledged: to eliminate the Kuomintang's organizations and personnel in Macao; to prohibit the display or use of Kuomintang flags, emblems, and other symbols or titles in Macao; to prevent Kuomintang organizations and personnel from engaging in any activities against the People's Republic of China in any form, and to expel Kuomintang organizations and personnel from Macao; if Kuomintang spies appear and operate in Macao in the future, the Portuguese authorities in Macao will arrest them and hand them over to the relevant departments of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee.

The ceremonies for the submission of the confession and the implementing document were held in Macao and Zhuhai County, Guangdong Province, respectively. In the halls where the ceremonies were held in both places, a giant portrait of Chairman Mao was hung in the center, and Chairman Mao's quotations were posted on the walls around. At 2 p.m. today, the Portuguese "Governor" Cabral bowed his head and signed the confession in front of representatives from various circles in Macao, and then handed the confession to the representative of various circles in Macao, Liang Pei. Before Cabral signed, the "Secretary of the Governor's Office" Pati read the confession on behalf of Cabral. Subsequently, Pati, on behalf of Cabral, went to Zhuhai to present the implementing document to the representative of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee's Foreign Affairs Office. Thirteen representatives from various circles in Macao attended the ceremony held in Zhuhai.

Over the past two months, compatriots from all walks of life in Macao have held more than 410 anti-persecution struggle meetings, exposing the Portuguese authorities' despicable tactics of trying to avoid taking responsibility by delaying, evading, and deceiving. They took unified action to punish the Portuguese authorities, forming a massive anti-imperialist mass movement that surrounded the Portuguese authorities like an ocean, making Portuguese officials unable to eat, drink, or travel, and facing resistance everywhere. The Macao compatriots, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and supported by the great socialist motherland, fought bravely and finally forced the Portuguese authorities to confess, shattering the conspiracy of American and British imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits to interfere in Macao's affairs, and exposing the shameless slander of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique.

In their anti-imperialist, patriotic struggle, the Macao compatriots have an unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao and resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings. They say: "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and all things grow with the sun. Our anti-imperialist, patriotic struggle relies on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought." "Every word of Chairman Mao is the truth, and we cannot do without Chairman Mao's teachings for a moment in our struggle." "Every victory of ours is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought can overcome any difficulty and defeat any demon."

Today, the entire city of Macao is in jubilation. The five-star red flag, riding the east wind, flies high on the rooftops of every household and flutters on the large and small boats on the sea. The streets are filled with the sound of firecrackers, and the compatriots are congratulating each other. The slogans "Long live the great unity of all Macao compatriots!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" and the sound of firecrackers echo through the streets. Many people face Beijing, face Tiananmen, and wish Chairman Mao a long life.

At this moment of celebrating victory with great pride, many people in Macao have opened their most beloved revolutionary books and read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when they deal with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic. This is a Marxist law. When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature cannot be changed. Imperialist elements will never lay down their butcher's knives, nor can they become Buddhas until their doom." Now, the Macao compatriots are always ready to fight against imperialism in new struggles.

　　战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
　　澳门同胞取得反帝爱国斗争的光辉胜利
　　澳葡当局签具认罪书全部接受我方条件
    据新华社香港二十九日电　澳门葡萄牙当局今天签具了它对“一一·一五”和“一二·三”血腥事件的认罪书和对我方条件的实施条款书，全部接受我广东省人民委员会外事处处长声明中提出的四项条件和澳门同胞提出的六项要求，承担残暴屠杀和迫害澳门中国居民的全部罪责。这是澳门爱国同胞高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在伟大社会主义祖国广大人民和红卫兵以及强大的中国人民解放军的坚决支持下，进行了两个多月的反帝爱国斗争所取得的光辉胜利。
    澳葡当局在递交给澳门同胞的认罪书中承认，它在“一一·一五”和“一二·三”血腥事件中犯下了“严重罪行”，要“承担全部责任”，惩办主凶，赔偿一切损失，向澳门全体中国居民“认罪和赔礼”，今后切实保证澳门中国居民的生命、财产安全，保障他们的正当权益。澳葡当局递交给广东省人委会外事处的对我方条件的实施条款书中保证：它执行肃清蒋帮在澳门的机构和人员；禁止在澳门悬挂或使用蒋旗、蒋徽等蒋帮的标志或称号；禁止蒋帮机构和人员以任何方式来进行反对中华人民共和国的活动，驱逐蒋帮机构和人员出澳门；今后如再有蒋帮特务在澳门出现和活动，澳葡当局即将他们逮捕交给广东省人民委员会有关部门。
    澳葡当局呈递认罪书和实施条款书的仪式分别在澳门和广东省珠海县拱北举行。在两地举行这个仪式的礼堂里，毛主席的巨幅画像悬挂在正中，毛主席语录贴在四周墙壁上。今天下午二时，澳葡“总督”嘉乐庇在澳门各界同胞代表面前，低头签具了认罪书，随即把认罪书呈递给澳门各界同胞代表梁培。在嘉乐庇签字之前，澳葡“总督府秘书长”波治代表嘉乐庇宣读了认罪书。随后，波治代表嘉乐庇到拱北向广东省人民委员会外事处代表呈递了实施条款书。澳门各界同胞代表十三人出席了在拱北举行的呈递仪式。
    两个多月来，澳门各行各业爱国同胞举行了四百一十多次反迫害斗争大会，戳穿了澳葡当局企图不认罪而进行推、拖、狡、赖的卑鄙手法，一致行动起来制裁澳葡当局，形成了声势浩大的反帝群众运动，把澳葡当局陷入汪洋大海似的群众包围之中，使澳葡官员饮无茶，食无餐，行无车船，到处受到抵制。澳门同胞高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在伟大社会主义祖国支持下英勇斗争，终于迫使澳葡当局低头认罪，粉碎了美、英帝国主义和蒋匪帮插手澳门事务的阴谋，揭穿了叛徒苏联现代修正主义领导集团无耻的造谣污蔑。
    澳门同胞在反帝爱国斗争中，无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席，最坚决地遵循毛主席的教导。他们说：“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。我们的反帝爱国斗争，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”“毛主席的话句句是真理，我们在斗争中一刻也离不开毛主席他老人家的教导。”“我们的每一个胜利都是毛泽东思想的胜利。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，什么困难都能克服，什么妖魔鬼怪都能战胜。”
    今天，澳门全市万众欢腾，五星红旗迎着红日，乘着东风，飞扬在家家户户的屋顶上，飘扬在海面一排排的大小船只上。大街小巷，鞭炮齐鸣，同胞们在互相祝贺。“全澳同胞大团结万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的口号声和鞭炮声，一阵高过一阵。多少人向着北京，向着天安门，遥祝毛主席万寿无疆。
    澳门同胞在怀着无比自豪的心情庆祝胜利的时刻，许许多多的人又翻开了随身带着的最最心爱的革命宝书，齐声朗读毛主席语录：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”现在，澳门同胞正时刻准备着同帝国主义进行新的斗争。（附图片）
