	For American monopolistic capital to open the door wide

	New York, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) - The Soviet foreign trade organization recently published a two-page advertisement in the New York Times, actively soliciting American capitalists to place advertisements in Soviet publications, radio, and television programs to "enhance relations with American businessmen."

	The Soviet revisionist leadership's step of opening the door to American capitalists immediately received praise from the U.S. State Department. On the 16th, State Department spokesman McCloskey expressed satisfaction with this matter, saying that the United States "welcomes this proof of the Soviet Union's desire to expand trade relations." He believed this was consistent with U.S. President Johnson's announcement on October 7 last year to expand East-West trade. In that speech, Johnson strongly advocated for the implementation of a policy of peaceful evolution in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, and used the expansion of trade with these countries as a bait to promote this policy.

	Opening Siberia's airspace to Japan

	Tokyo, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) - The Soviet revisionist leadership is intensifying its collusion with the Japanese Sato government. On the 20th, in Tokyo, they signed a contract regarding the joint operation of the Tokyo-Moscow international air route, which flies over Siberia.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership, at the expense of national interests, opened Siberia's airspace, which has defense significance and has never been opened to foreign airlines, to the Japanese side. This further exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

	The Soviet Union and Japan had preliminarily signed a Soviet-Japanese aviation agreement in Tokyo on January 15 last year. This agreement was reached after repeated concessions by the Soviet side. At that time, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Sugiura told reporters: "Japan did not expect (the Soviet Union) to make such concessions."

	According to the contract signed by both sides on the 20th, the Tokyo-Moscow route will open in April this year.

	Colluding with the Indonesian reactionaries

	Jakarta, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) - A "Soviet Workers' Delegation" sent by the current Soviet modern revisionist leadership, at the invitation of the Secretariat of the Indonesian Trade Union, arrived in Jakarta on the 18th for a "visit."

	In the context of the Indonesian reactionaries' bloody massacre of tens of thousands of communists and patriots, and the illegal ban on the Indonesian Communist Party and all progressive organizations, the Soviet modern revisionist leadership openly sent a workers' delegation to have close exchanges with the Indonesian yellow trade unions. This once again shows that it has openly merged with the Indonesian reactionaries, further exposing its role as a labor traitor and traitor.

	According to a report by the Antara News Agency on the 21st, this Soviet workers' delegation is led by Akhadorov, Chairman of the Trade Union of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic and a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

### 请看苏修领导集团的叛徒嘴脸

　　请看苏修领导集团的叛徒嘴脸
      为美国垄断资本敞开大门
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：苏联对外贸易机构最近在《纽约时报》上刊登两页广告，大肆招揽美国资本家在苏联的刊物、电台和电视节目中登广告，以“增进同美国企业家的关系”。
    苏联修正主义领导集团的这一向美国资本家敞开门户的步骤，立即得到美国国务院的喝采。美国国务院发言人麦克洛斯基十六日就这件事满意地表示，美国“欢迎苏联希望扩大贸易关系的这一证明”。他认为这同美国总统约翰逊在去年十月七日演说中宣布的扩大东西方贸易的步骤是一致的。约翰逊在那次演说中极力鼓吹在苏联和一些东欧国家加紧推行和平演变政策，并且把扩大同这些国家的贸易作为推行这一政策的诱饵。
      向日本开放西伯利亚上空
    据新华社二十一日讯　东京消息：苏联修正主义领导集团加紧同日本佐藤政府进行勾结，二十日在东京就共同经营东京—莫斯科之间飞经西伯利亚的国际航线签订了有关合同。
    苏联修正主义领导集团不惜出卖民族利益，向日本方面开放了从来未向外国航空公司开放的、有着国防意义的西伯利亚上空，这进一步暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团的叛徒面目。
    苏联同日本曾于去年一月十五日在东京草签了日苏航空协定。这个协定是在苏联方面一再做出让步之后达成的。当时，日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎曾对记者说：日本“完全没有想到（苏联）会让步到这种程度”。
    根据二十日双方签订的有关合同，东京—莫斯科航线将于今年四月间开航。
      和印尼反动派同流合污
    据新华社二十二日讯　雅加达消息：由苏联现代修正主义领导集团派遣的一个“苏联工人代表团”，应印度尼西亚工会联合书记处的邀请在十八日到达雅加达进行“访问”。
    在印尼反动派血腥屠杀几十万共产党人和爱国者，并且悍然非法禁止印度尼西亚共产党和一切进步团体的情况下，苏联现代修正主义领导集团公然派遣工人代表团同印尼黄色工会亲密交往，这再次表明它已经同印尼反动派公开合流，更加暴露了它的工贼和叛徒嘴脸。
    据安塔拉通讯社二十一日报道，这个苏联工人代表团由塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国工会主席、苏联最高苏维埃代表阿哈达罗夫担任团长。
