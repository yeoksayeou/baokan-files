The *Liberation Daily* published a letter from a reader calling for the year-end distribution in people's communes to smash the evil wind of economism.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 18th -- The Shanghai *Liberation Daily* on the 15th published a letter from a reader titled "The Year-End Distribution Must Emphasize Proletarian Politics." The letter calls for rural people's communes, which are currently conducting year-end distributions, to definitely smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist evil wind of economism. It urges adherence to Chairman Mao's teachings of "comprehensive planning and appropriate arrangements" to correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the commune members.

The *Liberation Daily* also added an editorial note when publishing this letter from a reader. The note points out: The evil wind of economism, stirred up by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and a few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, has blown from the urban areas to the suburbs. This matter deserves serious attention from all revolutionary masses. We fully agree with and firmly support the call from some revolutionary financial and accounting guidance personnel in Baoshan County. We hope that the revolutionary rebel organizations and the broad revolutionary masses in the suburbs will take action to decisively stop this evil wind and repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The collective economy of the people's communes is the lifeblood of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Those bourgeois stinkers attempt to play tricks with economism in the year-end distribution of commune members, pushing revisionist goods to achieve their evil goals of destroying the collective economy, agricultural production, and the Cultural Revolution. This is absolutely not allowed. The revolutionary rebel fighters and the broad revolutionary masses in the countryside must expose their conspiracies.

In the year-end distribution, whether the relationship between consumption and accumulation can be correctly handled is a major issue that affects whether the collective economy of the people's communes can be further consolidated and whether agricultural production can be further developed. We must emphasize proletarian politics, plan comprehensively, arrange appropriately, and handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual well, making the year-end distribution better than ever before.

The full text of the reader's letter is as follows:

Editor:

In the midst of the high tide of the Cultural Revolution, while the guns are roaring against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, these people are not willing to accept their defeat. They are playing new tricks, stirring up an evil wind of economism, inciting the masses, and attempting to divert a serious political struggle into the wrong path of economism to achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. This evil wind has also blown into the suburban rural people's communes, causing losses to the collective economy and collective production.

Currently, the countryside is conducting year-end distributions. This handful of people, in order to shift the focus of the struggle and to "protect" themselves, use the excuse of believing in the masses and promoting democracy, trading party policies and principles. In the year-end distribution, they are playing tricks. They use increased distribution to incite and appease some deceived masses, spreading reactionary slogans such as "production has no funds, borrow from the state, if not borrowed, rebel against them," causing some production teams to distribute all the production funds that should be retained, and as soon as the distribution is over, they go to the bank to borrow money. In some production teams that have increased production and income, the public accumulation has actually decreased.

They use the excuse of going out for "linking up" and "rebelling" to evade the struggle of the masses, making it impossible for the year-end distribution work to proceed normally. They also instigate some unaware commune members to go out for linking up, leaving their production posts, seriously disrupting winter production. Not only has it affected the accumulation and application of fertilizer, but the market supply of vegetables has also significantly decreased, affecting the lives of urban residents. In some places, the rice has not yet been threshed, affecting the completion of the state procurement tasks.

They also use the excuse of increasing the income of those who go out for work and those who are both workers and farmers to deepen the contradictions among the masses, inciting the masses to fight against each other, causing the income of many communes' outworkers and those who are both workers and farmers to remain unresolved.

The evil wind of economism in the suburban year-end distribution is created by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and a few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Baoshan County Party Committee and County People's Committee and a few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, at the commune president distribution work meeting, said: "This year's distribution is part of the rural Cultural Revolution." After discussing the distribution policy, they said, "What I say doesn't count, you can supplement, modify, or overturn it, promoting big democracy." In reality, they use the excuse of promoting big democracy to sabotage party policies. Some commune presidents copy the county's approach, even telling lower-level cadres: "In the future, when we encounter policy issues, we should shrug off responsibility." Meaning it's better to mind your own business. Some people also incite the masses to use the accumulated funds from previous years and invest them in the year-end distribution.

To quickly smash the new tricks of economism played by a few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, we appeal to the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses:

1. In the distribution work, emphasize proletarian politics, smash economism, and firmly adhere to Chairman Mao's teachings of "comprehensive planning and appropriate arrangements." Follow the party's distribution policy to do a good job in distribution. We must strengthen our high sense of political responsibility towards the socialist collective economy, put "public" first, and correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the commune members.

2. The poor and lower-middle peasants should take immediate action to resist and expose the new tricks of economism played by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and a few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. We must insist on seizing the revolution and promoting production to achieve double victories in the Cultural Revolution and production.

3. We hope that the revolutionary organizations in the countryside will unite, and the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses will unite. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously carry out propaganda activities, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Long live the victorious proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Long live the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao!

Part of the revolutionary financial and accounting guidance personnel in the rural areas of Baoshan County

    年终分配一定要突出无产阶级政治 
    《解放日报》发表读者来信呼吁人民公社年终分配必须打倒经济主义妖风
    新华社上海十八日电　上海《解放日报》十五日刊登了一篇题为《年终分配一定要突出无产阶级政治》的读者来信，呼吁农村人民公社在目前正在进行的年终分配中，一定要打倒反革命修正主义的经济主义妖风，坚决遵照毛主席“统筹兼顾、适当安排”的教导，正确处理国家、集体、社员三者关系。
    《解放日报》在发表这篇读者来信的同时，加了编者按。按语指出：由党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子所掀起的一股经济主义妖风，从市区刮到了郊区，这件事很值得我们所有革命群众的严重注意。我们完全赞成，并且坚决支持宝山县的部分社队革命财会辅导员提出的呼吁，希望郊区各地革命造反派组织和广大革命群众积极行动起来，坚决煞住这股妖风，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    人民公社集体经济是我们贫下中农的命根子，那些资产阶级臭老爷们妄图在社员年终分配上玩弄经济主义，推行修正主义货色，以达到破坏集体经济，破坏农业生产，破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的，这是万万办不到的。农村的革命造反派战士们和广大革命群众，一定要揭穿他们的阴谋诡计。
    在年终分配中，能不能正确处理消费和积累的关系，是关系到人民公社集体经济能不能进一步巩固，农业生产能不能进一步发展的大事。我们一定要突出无产阶级政治，统筹兼顾，适当安排，处理好国家、集体、个人三者之间的关系，把年终分配搞得比以往任何一年更好。
    读者来信全文如下：编辑同志：
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在万炮齐轰上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的时候，这些人并不甘心他们的失败，还在玩弄新的花招，刮起一股经济主义的妖风，煽动群众，企图把一场严肃的政治斗争引入经济主义的歧路，以达到他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。这股妖风也刮到了郊区农村人民公社，给集体经济和集体生产带来了损失。
    目前，农村正在进行年终分配。这一小撮人为了转移斗争目标，为了“保”自己，他们借口相信群众，发扬民主，拿党的政策、原则做交易，在年终分配中大搞阴谋。他们以增加分配来煽动和迎合部分受蒙蔽的群众，散布“生产没有资金，向国家贷款，不贷就造他们的反”的反动论调，以致有些生产队把应留的生产资金都分掉，分配一结束就向银行要贷款，有些增产增收的队，公共积累反而减少。
    他们以外出“串连”、“造反”为名，逃避群众斗争，使年终分配工作不能正常进行。他们还唆使不明真相的社员群众外出串连，离开生产岗位，严重破坏了冬季生产，不仅影响了积肥追肥，而且蔬菜上市量大大减少，影响了城市人民生活；在少数地区稻谷至今还没有脱粒，影响了国家征购任务的完成。
    他们还以增加外出工和亦工亦农人员的收入为名，加深群众之间的矛盾，挑动群众斗群众，致使不少公社的外出工和亦工亦农人员的收入至今不能解决。
    郊区年终分配中的经济主义妖风，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人一手制造出来的。宝山县县委、县人委的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，在主持公社社长分配工作会议上说：“今年的分配是农村文化大革命的内容之一。”在谈了分配政策以后却说什么“我说的不算，你们可以补充，可以修改，也可以推翻，发扬大民主。”实际上是借口发扬大民主，破坏党的政策。某些公社社长，照搬县里的一套，甚至对下级干部说：“今后你我碰到政策问题要卸肩胛。”意思是少管为妙。某些人还煽动群众动用历年来的积累，投入年终分配。
    为了迅速粉碎一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的人玩弄经济主义的新阴谋，我们向革命造反派、革命群众呼吁：
    一、在分配工作中突出无产阶级政治，打倒经济主义，坚决遵照毛主席“统筹兼顾、适当安排”的教导，按照党的分配政策做好分配工作。要加强对社会主义集体经济的高度政治责任感，要“公”字当头，正确处理国家、集体和社员三者关系。
    二、贫下中农立即行动起来，抵制和揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的人所玩弄的经济主义的新阴谋，坚持抓革命，促生产，夺取文化革命和生产双胜利。
    三、希望农村的革命组织联合起来，革命干部和革命群众团结起来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力开展宣传活动，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
        宝山县农村的部分社队革命财会辅导员
