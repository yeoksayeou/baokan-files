Well Done!

Up the mountains! To reclaim wasteland! Albanian revolutionary youth have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party of Labour. For more than two months, they have flocked in groups to the barren mountains and wilderness, eager to become builders of the mountain regions. This is a major event in the life of Albanian youth nationwide and an important milestone in the Albanian people's march towards revolutionization.

The revolutionary actions of Albanian youth demonstrate their resolve to transform nature and build their country. They hack through thickets and toil diligently, determined to carve out a new world with their own hands, making the mountainous regions of their country as fertile and beautiful as the plains.

More importantly, in the process of transforming the objective world, Albanian youth will also transform their subjective world, further strengthening their ideological revolutionization.

The leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, has said: "To temper the younger generation with a revolutionary, class-conscious spirit... is a major issue concerning the future of our country's revolutionary cause and socialist cause."

Mobilizing youth to engage in labor and to go among the masses, to let them face the wind and rain and see the world, this is precisely the important measure taken by the Party of Labour of Albania to solve this major issue.

Now, Albanian youth are heeding the Party's call and taking active steps. They are determined to temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. They are well done!

　　好样的！
　　上山去！开荒去！阿尔巴尼亚革命青年热烈响应劳动党的号召，两个多月来成群结队，奔赴荒山野岭，争当山区建设者。这是阿尔巴尼亚全国青年生活中的一件大事，也是阿尔巴尼亚人民在革命化道路上迈进的一个重要标志。
    阿尔巴尼亚青年的革命行动，表现了他们改造自然、建设祖国的决心。他们披荆斩棘，辛勤劳动，要用自己的双手开辟出一个新的天地，把祖国的山区建设得像平原一样富饶，美丽。
    更重要的是，阿尔巴尼亚青年在改造客观世界过程中，也将改造自己的主观世界，进一步加强自己思想革命化。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志说：“以革命的、阶级的精神来锻炼青年一代，……这是关系到我国革命事业和社会主义事业今后的命运的重大问题。”
    动员青年投身到劳动中去，到群众中去，让他们经风雨，见世面，这正是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为了解决这个重大问题而采取的重要措施。
    现在，阿尔巴尼亚青年听党的话，积极行动起来了。他们决心把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人，他们是好样的！
