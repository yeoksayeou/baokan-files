Revolutionary Rebels Unite

Shanghai *Wen Hui Bao* Editorial, January 13

Representatives from various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai and from other regions stationed in Shanghai have formed the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebel Organizations Liaison Station. This revolutionary initiative is excellent! The realization of this initiative will promote the great unity of revolutionary forces and significantly advance the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Shanghai.

Revolution requires unity. From the very beginning, Marx and Engels called for "Workers of the world, unite!" Forty-seven years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao proposed the battle cry of "Great Unity of the People." In this unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, revolutionary rebels face arduous and complex struggles, enduring countless hardships and trials. They need to learn from each other, support each other, cooperate closely, and fight together. With the great unity of revolutionary rebels as the core, we must unite all revolutionary forces that can be united and launch a fierce attack on the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and those stubbornly implementing the reactionary bourgeois line.

Unity brings strength, and unity brings victory. The numerous proofs of class struggle show that when revolutionary forces unite, the counter-revolutionary forces collapse. Recently, a handful of capital roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Committee, after being thoroughly politically dismantled, have resorted to counter-revolutionary revisionist economic tricks, attempting to use "sugar-coated bullets" to defeat us rebels. It is precisely because the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, the Red Revolutionary Alliance, and dozens of other revolutionary rebel organizations have united, issuing important documents such as the "Open Letter to the People of Shanghai" and "Emergency Announcement," and conducting comprehensive class struggle, that we have quickly repelled the new counterattack by the handful of people in the Shanghai Municipal Committee. The masters of the Shanghai Municipal Committee are now surrounded by the revolutionary rebels, with waves of revolution from all sides and revolutionary songs from all directions, and they can no longer escape their inevitable downfall.

The handful of masters in the Shanghai Municipal Committee are finished; they are about to be completely overthrown. At this critical moment of the decisive battle between socialism and capitalism, all revolutionary rebels in the city must step forward, act swiftly, and unite even more closely to wage a struggle for power. We must seize the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and the destiny of the socialist economy firmly in our own hands. We must immediately establish a united organization of revolutionary rebels across the city, propose a clear proletarian revolutionary program, take decisive measures, mobilize the masses, establish a new revolutionary order, and repel the enemy's rampant counterattacks at any time. We are confident that once we have kicked out the handful of people within the Shanghai Municipal Committee, the revolution and production in the Shanghai region will flourish under the leadership of the revolutionary rebels.

Unity is not about compromise, and unity is not about muddling through. We are uniting on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. All revolutionary rebels should prioritize the revolutionary overall interests, completely abandon any selfish motives, and join hands and fight shoulder to shoulder on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, the process of great unity and great alliance is also necessarily a process of eliminating bourgeois elements and establishing proletarian elements.

Look at Shanghai today; it is the world of revolutionary rebels!

Revolutionary Rebels Unite!

    革命造反派联合起来
    上海《文汇报》一月十三日社论
    由上海和外地驻沪的各革命造反团体派出联络员，组成上海市革命造反派组织联络站，这个革命倡议好得很！这个倡议的实现，将促进革命力量的大团结，将大大地推动上海市的无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    革命就是需要联合，马克思、恩格斯一开始就号召“全世界无产者，联合起来！”伟大领袖毛主席早在四十七年前就提出了“民众的大联合”的战斗口号。在这史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，广大革命造反派，面临着艰巨复杂的斗争，经历着千难万险的考验，更加需要互相学习，互相支援，紧密合作，共同战斗。并且以革命造反派的大联合为核心，把一切可以团结的革命力量团结起来，向一小撮反革命修正主义分子和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的坏家伙猛烈开火。
    联合就有力量，联合就能胜利。阶级斗争的无数事实证明，革命力量联合起来了，反革命势力就垮台了。近来，上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在政治上全面瓦解以后，玩弄反革命修正主义的经济主义花招，妄图用“糖衣炮弹”攻垮我们造反派。正是由于上海工人革命造反总司令部、红革会等几十个革命造反团体联合起来，相继发表了《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》等重要文件，进行了全面的阶级斗争，很快就把上海市委一小撮人的新反扑狠狠地打回去。上海市委的老爷们已处于革命造反派的重重包围之中，八方卷浪潮，四面起楚歌，再也逃不掉彻底垮台的命运。
    上海市委的一小撮老爷们不行了，他们马上要彻底完蛋了。在这社会主义与资本主义决战的关键时刻，我们全市革命造反派必须挺身而出，迅速地行动起来，更好地联合起来，进行一场夺权的斗争，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧地掌握在自己手里。我们必须立即建立全市革命造反派的联合组织，提出鲜明的无产阶级革命纲领，采取果断的措施，放手发动群众，建立新的革命的秩序，随时打退敌人的猖狂反扑。我们坚信，踢开了上海市委内的一小撮人，上海地区的革命和生产事业就会在革命造反派的领导下蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。
    联合决不是搞折衷，联合决不是和稀泥。我们是在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的原则基础上的大团结、大联合。一切革命造反派都应以革命的全局利益为重，彻底抛弃任何私心杂念，在毛主席的革命路线上携起手来，并肩战斗。因此，大团结、大联合的过程，也必然是灭资兴无、破私立公的斗争过程。
    喜看今日之上海，已是革命造反派的天下！
    革命造反派联合起来！
