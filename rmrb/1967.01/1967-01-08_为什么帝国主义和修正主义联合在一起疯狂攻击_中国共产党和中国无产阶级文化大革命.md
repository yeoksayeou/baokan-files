All reactionary forces—headed by the American imperialists, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet traitor leaders, and the reactionaries of various countries—are furiously attacking the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. They are particularly conducting the most frenzied slander and attacks against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution now triumphantly unfolding in the People's Republic of China. The traitor leaders of the Soviet Communist Party are now raising the black flag of anti-Marxism and anti-China propaganda.

Why are they doing this? What is their intention? This is because the conspiracy plotted by the Khrushchev revisionists to oppose socialism and the revolutionary movement of the world Marxist-Leninists since the death of Stalin has been struck and is continuing to be struck. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party is a new and powerful blow to the hostile conspiracy of the Khrushchev clique, because this revolution exposes and is resolutely striking the revisionist elements hidden within the Chinese Communist Party, eliminating any possibility of revisionist degeneration.

The counter-revolutionary conspiracies of imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism have already failed and will continue to fail.

It has been fully proven that one of the favorite methods used by the American imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists to sabotage socialism and the world communist movement is the so-called "peaceful evolution," relying on traitors, revisionists, and counter-revolutionaries to actively support and encourage them to attack the fortress from within. The Khrushchev clique seized power through this method. It is known that the hidden Khrushchev clique, relying on the bureaucratized, bourgeoisified, degenerated, and anti-people cadres and intellectuals—who have lost their revolutionary spirit and qualities—exploited the lack of vigilance, vacillation, and concessions of the Soviet leadership after Stalin's death, and the hesitation in openly fighting against the revisionist danger relying on the whole party and the masses. They took advantage of this to seize the leadership of the Soviet Party and state through a coup. The purpose of the Khrushchev clique in doing this was to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat, destroy the socialist achievements gained by the Soviet people under Stalin's leadership through blood, struggle, and tremendous labor, and help the revisionists and traitors in other socialist countries to do the same, seize power in their own countries, and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism.

The rise of revisionists in the Soviet Union and some other socialist countries is the greatest counter-revolutionary conspiracy staged by imperialists and revisionists against the working class and the socialist cause. However, the realization of this conspiracy is not an overnight affair. This counter-revolutionary political conspiracy is gradually plotted by the revisionists. Under the guise of false Marxism and false socialism, they set out to corrupt people's souls, deceive them ideologically, make cadres, communists, and laboring masses lose their revolutionary ideals, and instill bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, customs, and ways of life into them. This is a kind of insidious and imperceptible sabotage, gradually undermining and destroying the foundations of the socialist system from within, preparing for a counter-revolutionary coup through daily, imperceptible quantitative changes, to achieve qualitative changes, abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and replace it with revisionist dictatorship, and implement bourgeois and capitalist policies in all aspects of domestic and international life.

In this act of betrayal, the Khrushchev revisionists received the full support and assistance of American imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and all the opportunistic, liberal, social democratic, and bourgeois pacifist currents in the world, who all regard the revisionists as their loyal allies and an indispensable tool in their struggle against socialism, revolution, and the freedom of the peoples of various countries. Modern revisionism, relying on the active support of all counter-revolutionary forces, relying on the prestige and power of socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union, and relying on the cunning trick of bewitching people's minds as the "most clever" means, has become the greatest and most dangerous enemy in the history of the international communist movement. Modern revisionists, allied with imperialists, first and foremost with American imperialists, and all reactionaries and traitors of the working class, have launched a comprehensive attack on Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and revolution, attempting to make the socialist camp and the communist parties of various countries degenerate and perish, undermine the revolutionary movement, restore the capitalist system, and maintain the capitalist system in the world.

However, the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the Khrushchev revisionists has been and cannot but be met with the resolute opposition and resistance of the Albanian Party of Labor and the Chinese Communist Party. There exists principled unity between the two parties and between them and all the fraternal Marxist-Leninist parties and all revolutionary communists in the world. They have always been steadfast in their loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and have actively fought to maintain the purity of Marxism-Leninism and for the victory of the socialist cause. They have torn off the "Marxist-Leninist" mask of the Khrushchev revisionist clique and exposed to the world their true face of betrayal and treachery to socialism, acting as allies and accomplices of imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries.

The Khrushchev revisionists are desperately trying to frustrate this resistance, attempting to make the Marxist-Leninist parties surrender, and therefore, through various different means and methods, they have taken hostile actions against the Albanian Party of Labor and the Chinese Communist Party, especially in the political, economic, military, and ideological aspects. They have imposed multi-faceted pressures and carried out rampant blockades against them, conspiring with the mortal enemies of socialism, the American imperialists, the traitor Tito clique, and the Indian reactionaries, and so on, against the two parties. At the same time, to promote revisionism, the Khrushchev revisionists have carried out large-scale sabotage activities against our two parties, mobilizing all their spy agencies, openly supporting anti-party and hostile elements, inciting counter-revolution, attempting to seize the fortress from within.

However, due to the principled and firm stance and principled and resolute struggle taken by the Chinese Communist Party, the Albanian Party of Labor, and all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces, the revisionists have suffered one failure after another. The blockade imposed by the revisionists and imperialists against the People's Republic of Albania and the People's Republic of China has completely failed. The invincible power of the Albanian and Chinese peoples, firmly united around their Marxist-Leninist parties, has smashed this blockade. The open debate launched by the Khrushchev clique against the Albanian Party of Labor and the Chinese Communist Party has backfired, dealing a fatal blow to the traitor revisionists and tearing off their masks. This debate has deepened the general crisis of modern revisionism, worsened the contradictions within the revisionist camp, accelerated the process of splitting the communist movement, drawn a clear line between revolutionary Marxist-Leninists and traitor revisionists, and helped to organize new Marxist-Leninist forces. These new forces already have dozens of parties, organizations, and groups on all continents.

It is precisely this heavy defeat that has forced the current Soviet leadership to abandon their infamous mastermind and leader Khrushchev, change their tactics and means of struggle, and put on some new masks to deceive communists and the peoples of various countries, secretly carrying out the anti-revolutionary line of Khrushchev without Khrushchev.

The new Soviet leaders, led by Brezhnev and Kosygin, who faithfully follow the line and principles of Khrushchev, have realized that Khrushchev's "rude" line, the line of face-to-face struggle, has brought unfavorable results to the revisionists. Therefore, they have formulated a strategy mainly relying on their hidden friends, relying on such factors and elements to secretly carry out sabotage. These factors and elements can become propagandists of revisionism and tools for sabotaging the dictatorship of the proletariat in places where the doors are tightly closed to Khrushchev revisionism, such as China, Albania, and elsewhere. Moreover, the treacherous tricks of the current Soviet leaders, who have already become traitors, immediately received the support of American imperialism. In fact, while the Khrushchev revisionists are stepping up support for hidden revisionists and stepping up sabotage activities against socialism and the Marxist-Leninist movement, paying attention to encouraging factors and elements that lead to the degeneration of socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, the American imperialists and their accomplices are stepping up armed aggression and military pressure. The treacherous tricks of the American imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists are first and foremost aimed at the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Albania, and all countries and Marxist-Leninist parties that do not submit to the policies of the two superpowers (the Soviet Union and the United States).

However, the vicious tactics of the Khrushchev revisionists and American imperialists, like their past tactics, have also failed. The Chinese Communist Party, the Albanian Party of Labor, and all revolutionary Marxist-Leninists have powerfully exposed the traitorous face of the new Soviet Communist Party leadership, from the beginning, they have exposed their hostile conspiracies, and with various facts, they have proven that the new Soviet Communist Party leadership not only faithfully follows the Khrushchev revisionist line but is even more dangerous, more ferocious, and more cunning than its already collapsed mastermind.

The Chinese Communist Party, the Albanian Party of Labor, and all true revolutionaries have bravely and persistently fought a principled struggle to expose the treacherous conspiracies and actions of the Soviet revisionist leaders. This struggle has dealt a heavy blow to the Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their clique. But this is not the only failure. The Khrushchev revisionists and their treacherous plans have suffered another major failure, which is that their delusion of eventually achieving some kind of revisionist "evolution" in China or Albania has completely collapsed.

As true Marxist-Leninist parties, the Albanian Party of Labor and the Chinese Communist Party have always been steadfast and brave in their struggle against the danger of revisionism, both in their foreign struggle against the revisionist traitors such as Khrushchev and Tito in the international communist movement, and in their internal struggle against the danger of revisionism in our countries. The emergence and spread of revisionism in the Soviet Union and some other socialist countries is a great lesson for our Party of Labor and the Chinese Communist Party. It tells us that true Marxist-Leninists must fight against the danger of revisionist betrayal on two fronts. This is the true guarantee for the complete destruction of revisionism and the final victory of Marxism-Leninism.

The Albanian Party of Labor has learned from the tragic lessons of Soviet revisionism and has already taken and will take all necessary measures to eradicate any signs that may lead to the emergence of revisionism in our country, to prevent the danger of revisionists seizing power and restoring capitalism in the future, and to ensure that the socialist revolution continues to develop in all aspects until socialism and communism are completely built in our country. For this purpose, the Albanian Party of Labor, according to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism and based on the specific conditions of our country, has already and is correctly carrying out the class struggle, constantly strengthening the party and the dictatorship of the proletariat, resolutely fighting against bureaucracy, deeply implementing the mass line, successfully carrying out the cultural and ideological revolution, strengthening our country's defensive forces, and resolutely implementing the line of revolutionizing all aspects of our country's life.

The Albanian Party of Labor, according to the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, based on the historical experience of socialist construction in our country and the bitter experience of the emergence, seizure of power, and spread of revisionism in the Soviet Union and some other countries, has taken various revolutionary measures. All these measures are brilliantly reflected in many of our Party's documents, especially in the open letter of the Central Committee and the historical documents of the Fifth Congress of the Party, which are a fatal blow to the treacherous plans of the Khrushchev revisionists and other revisionists to sabotage and corrupt our Party and our socialist state from within, just as they did in their own countries. The revolutionary measures that our Party will further implement will block the road to the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in Albania.

The Chinese Communist Party, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, eliminate the possibility of the restoration of capitalism and the emergence and growth of revisionism, has already and is taking major revolutionary measures, which are particularly reflected in the magnificent development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

The Khrushchev revisionist faction of the Soviet Communist Party leadership feels cornered. Seeing their entire plans and hopes one by one collapse, they are forced, willingly or unwillingly, to pick up the "hardline" strategy of their mastermind and ancestor Khrushchev again, and launch a frenzied attack on the Marxist-Leninists, formulating plans to convene an international communist conference, and so on. This is just a desperate tactic, and the result is well known. It was this line and action that brought down Khrushchev. Undoubtedly, this line and action will also bring the traitor revisionists who succeeded Khrushchev to an inglorious end.

Although Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their accomplices have picked up Khrushchev's tricks again, it can be seen that there are slight differences on the surface. For example, Khrushchev initially attacked Marxism-Leninism and first named the Albanian Party of Labor, then attacked the Chinese Communist Party and the Albanian Party of Labor. However, his successors adopted a strategy of silence towards our Party for a period, probably in an attempt to force our Party to remain silent and thus force our Party to abandon the struggle against revisionism. This malicious intention and its purpose of driving a wedge between the Albanian Party of Labor and the Chinese Communist Party are not difficult to see through. This is in vain. The Albanian Party of Labor did not and will never fall into this trap. It has honorably fulfilled its internationalist duty and has been and will continue to be in complete unity with the Chinese Communist Party and all true Marxist-Leninists, persistently and unremittingly fighting a principled struggle to thoroughly expose the great treachery of the revisionists. Not only that, it will further strengthen this struggle until it completely and thoroughly smashes Khrushchev revisionism, Tito revisionism, and the entire modern revisionism.

The Soviet revisionist leaders, in collusion with American imperialists and others, are now taking joint actions and concentrating all their firepower to attack the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Mao Zedong, attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unfolding in the People's Republic of China. Among the various anti-China materials published in the Soviet press, the editorial of the November 27 issue of *Pravda* titled "On the Events in China" is noteworthy. This editorial reflects the official stance of the Soviet leadership and is a preparatory propaganda for the December 12 plenary session of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, where the revisionist Brezhnev attacked and slandered the Chinese Communist Party. The aforementioned anti-China materials viciously attack the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong himself. The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong are slandered as having committed nationalism, chauvinism, splitism, anti-Sovietism, adventurism, and as violating the principles of scientific socialism, defaming the communist ideal, and so on. These materials particularly vilify the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, calling it terrible and despicable, saying that it not only does not conform to but openly violates Lenin's teachings, and so on.

If we do not talk about the stale and vulgar slanders against the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party, because they are no different from what the most reactionary bourgeois news agencies and newspapers publish and propagate, then the editorial of *Pravda* and the materials of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party are worth noting, because they expose the anxieties and true intentions of the traitor Khrushchev revisionists, exposing their counter-revolutionary conspiracies against the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China.

The Soviet revisionist leaders and their followers attack the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong and oppose them to Marxism-Leninism, attempting to attack and resist revolutionary Marxism-Leninism, while on the other hand, they claim their opportunistic and counter-revolutionary views to be the "true and purer" Marxism-Leninism. They do this to try to erase the great influence that the Marxist-Leninist thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, led by him, have on the revolutionary peoples of the world under the current conditions. They want to create and develop.

The Khrushchev revisionists have launched the most frenzied slanders against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, trying to oppose this revolution to Lenin's teachings on the cultural revolution, attempting to denigrate the purpose of this revolution itself, which is to take the cultural revolution as a prerequisite to advance the cause of socialism and communism, to prevent revisionism from spreading in socialist countries, and to prevent the restoration of capitalism in socialist countries. The Khrushchev revisionists try to use the above methods to justify their bourgeois line of degeneration in front of the communists and laboring masses of their own country, claiming that this line conforms to Lenin's teachings; they try to stop and suppress the revolutionary awakening of the broad masses and youth of their country, because the people and youth see the living example of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which shows how the people themselves, the workers, peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals, bravely stand up and say to the revisionists and traitors: "Hands off!" how to defend the thoughts of Marxism-Leninism and put the fate of the revolution and socialism in their own hands.

The traitor Soviet leaders call the bourgeois right-wing elements and revisionists who have infiltrated the Chinese Communist Party and have been severely struck down in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution "martyrs of Marxism-Leninism," openly sheltering these elements, and vigorously supporting their hidden agents, because they have such hopes for these agents: to overthrow the revolutionary leadership of the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong, to make the Chinese Communist Party abandon its principled and resolute struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, to make the Chinese Communist Party surrender, to make the party and the socialist system of China degenerate, and even to lead People's China onto the road of restoring capitalism.

The Khrushchev revisionists fiercely attack the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong for executing a line of unshakable and resolute struggle against modern revisionism, especially against the traitorous leadership of the Soviet Communist Party—which has already joined forces with American imperialism—and desperately try to justify their anti-China foreign policy in front of the people of their own country and the peoples of the world, for the conspiracies they have plotted with American imperialists and various reactionary forces to oppose the People's Republic of China.

In addition, the Khrushchev revisionists and their followers viciously attack the Cultural Revolution, spreading the most malicious lies about it, using all means to distort the content and purpose of the Cultural Revolution, and on the other hand, slandering People's China as pursuing adventurous and warlike, chauvinistic, and racist policies in the international arena. They do this to try to isolate the Chinese Communist Party in the international communist and revolutionary movement, to isolate the People's Republic of China in the world, to intimidate the revolutionary peoples of various countries, and to sow discord between them and China.

However, their counter-revolutionary goals will never be achieved and will suffer new heavy defeats. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unfolding in the People's Republic of China has dealt a heavy blow to the Khrushchev revisionists and their allies, smashing their dream of sabotaging the Chinese Communist Party and People's China from within and making them deviate from the correct revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism they have been following. In China, it has uprooted the roots of revisionism and bourgeois degeneration. This is why this revolution has made true revolutionaries and the peoples of the world feel exhilarated, but it has caused the most malicious curses, accusations, slanders, and attacks from imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries. This fully proves that the Chinese Cultural Revolution is on the right path, and it has struck hard at the objects that must be struck.

The great historical victories of socialism in the People's Republic of China

Socialist construction is a very long revolutionary process that includes the transformation of the entire life of society, the transformation of its material and spiritual life. An extremely important task in this process is to complete the cultural revolution as a component of the socialist revolution. The classic writers of Marxism-Leninism have emphasized in their works the necessity of carrying out the cultural revolution, considering it an indispensable condition for building socialism and communism, this new society. The plan for building socialism, in addition to the industrialization of the state and the collectivization of agriculture, also includes the completion of the cultural revolution. Lenin pointed out that the fundamental purpose of this revolution is to destroy the bourgeois culture and ideology, to create a new culture with socialist content in national form, to make culture belong to the broad masses of the people, and to cultivate a new type of intellectuals who come from the laboring people and serve them.

The revisionists, in order to cover up their betrayal and slander People's China, do not generally oppose the cultural revolution, because doing so would expose themselves too blatantly. However, they oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Why does the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China make the Khrushchev revisionists, American imperialists, and all counter-revolutionary and reactionary forces in the world so anxious? Because this revolution is extremely important and profound for the fate of Chinese socialism, for the cause of socialism and the revolutionary movement in the world. Because the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is based on the teachings of Marxism-Leninism, is the creative application and development of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong; is a summary of the positive experiences of socialist construction in China and other socialist countries, as well as the negative experiences of the spread of revisionism in the Soviet Union and some other countries, so the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a very valuable new contribution to socialist theory and practice. This revolution aims to achieve a series of important political, ideological, cultural, organizational, and military goals both domestically and internationally.

First of all, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China clearly shows the class struggle between socialism and capitalism, which is a serious struggle between two opposite paths, the socialist path and the capitalist path, that exists in every country throughout the history of socialism. Marxism-Leninism teaches us, and historical experience has proven and continues to prove every day, that class struggle is conducted in various forms in all areas of life—economic, political, spiritual, and military. Lenin, in summarizing the experience of class struggle under socialist conditions, once emphasized: "The dictatorship of the proletariat is the stubborn struggle of the proletariat against the forces and traditions of the old society, that is, the bloody and bloodless, violent and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative struggle." He pointed out, "After the overthrow of the bourgeois government, after the destruction of the bourgeois state, after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle does not disappear (as the philistines of the old socialism and the old social democracy imagined), but only changes its form, and in many respects becomes more cruel." (Lenin, *Collected Works*, Chinese edition, Volume 31, p. 26)

The enemies of socialism, the old and new enemies within and outside socialist countries, never stop their activities, trying to eliminate the socialist system and restore capitalism. For this purpose, they use two basic methods according to various situations, or combine the two methods: preparing and launching counter-revolutionary and armed aggression; making the socialist system "peacefully" evolve, that is, using "peaceful" means to carry out counter-revolution. The latter method is the method of degeneration leading to revisionism, just as the tragic experience of what happened in the Soviet Union and some other socialist countries has proven, this method is a great, serious, and constant danger to the socialist system.

Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." Comrade Mao Zedong also emphasized: "After the basic victory of the socialist revolution in our country, there are still some people who dream of restoring the capitalist system. They will fight against the working class from all aspects, including the ideological struggle. And in this struggle, the revisionists are their best assistants."

The fundamental and overall purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is to forever block the road to the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China, to prevent the tragedy that happened in the Soviet Union from repeating itself, to ensure that the socialist revolution continues to develop in all aspects, and to create reliable guarantees for the complete victory of socialism, until the complete construction of socialism and the classless communist society. It can be seen that the Cultural Revolution is an inseparable part of the entire socialist revolution, is the development and further deepening of the socialist revolution, is its advanced stage.

The class struggle in the ideological and cultural fields of socialist countries, in the final analysis, is a struggle for the seizure of power. The tragic experience in the Soviet Union shows that political socialist revolution does not end with the overthrow of the ruling class and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The decisive initial victory of the working class over the class enemies cannot be considered the final victory. This revolution must be continued to be pushed forward: constantly strengthening and perfecting the dictatorship of the proletariat, making the dictatorship of the proletariat not affected by bureaucracy, avoiding degeneration under the influence of the bourgeoisie and revisionism, eliminating the old and new counter-revolutionary elements who may infiltrate the state apparatus and sabotage the people's power, preparing all laboring people ideologically and politically, educating them with high revolutionary spirit, making the broad laboring masses, under the leadership of the Party, take on the responsibility of maintaining and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat themselves, and making the masses supervise the state organs and the officials. This is one of the fundamental purposes of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the People's Republic of China, that is, to maintain and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat in China, to prevent it from degenerating into revisionist and bourgeois counter-revolutionary dictatorship. The extremely important significance of this revolution lies here.

The bourgeoisie and revisionists, these enemies, try to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat and the entire socialist system, to restore capitalism, and direct their arrows first at the Marxist-Leninist party, trying to seize power within the party, sabotage the party, make the party degenerate, abolish the revolutionary party of the working class, and turn it into a weapon to achieve their anti-socialist and counter-revolutionary purposes. Under certain conditions, as happened in the Soviet Union and some other countries, there is a danger of the party losing its revolutionary nature, bureaucratizing, and degenerating. Bourgeois and revisionist elements may infiltrate the ranks of the party, or some people who were once more or less revolutionary may degenerate into revisionists and enemies of socialism, they may climb to important leadership positions and use their positions to sabotage the socialist revolution and socialist construction, make the party deviate from the Marxist-Leninist line, spread revisionist views and lines within the party. Therefore, the struggle against this danger is extremely important for the fate of the revolution and socialism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a fierce struggle against the attempts of the bourgeois and revisionist elements to make the Chinese Communist Party deviate from the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. The Cultural Revolution has dealt a devastating blow to their evil conspiracies, making the entire Party more closely united around the firm line of Marxism-Leninism and anti-revisionism of Comrade Mao Zedong, and it has become a great school for all communists to undergo revolutionary tempering. It continuously makes the life of the entire Party and state vigorous and more combative.

The most striking feature of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is that it is an unprecedented movement of tens of millions of laboring masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, youth, and intellectuals, who are armed with the thoughts of Mao Zedong as their guide to action, making their thoughts revolutionary, making the entire life of the state revolutionary, and in all aspects—including culture and art—displaying their pioneering spirit and making creative efforts, implementing revolutionary supervision. This powerful conscious revolutionary movement of the broad masses has immeasurable great historical significance. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only speeds up the self-reliant socialist construction led by the Party of the people in all aspects of the People's Republic of China—this revolution has built an insurmountable wall, making the hostile activities of the bourgeois and revisionist elements who try to spread the revisionist line in China and lead the country onto the road of restoring capitalism unable to succeed. In contrast to the negative experience in the Soviet Union, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great and positive lesson, showing the unlimited trust in the broad masses of the people, making them actively participate in the revolution, arming them with the thoughts of Marxism-Leninism, and fully developing their revolutionary pioneering spirit. This is the most effective means to eradicate the weeds of revisionism, and the most reliable guarantee to forever block the road to the restoration of capitalism in any socialist country.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a great school for the broad laboring masses, especially the new generation, to undergo revolutionary tempering. This is a matter of great importance for the future of socialism, because the youth are the successors of the revolution and will further advance the revolution. Historical experience has proven that only by directly and actively participating in the revolution can one cultivate the next generation into the rightful heirs of the revolutionary and socialist cause, who can steadfastly adhere to revolutionary ideals, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties and obstacles, no matter how great and arduous they may be, and defend and realize these ideals to the death. Without cultivating such a revolutionary and fighting youth generation, the revolutionary and socialist cause has no guarantee and will inevitably fail sooner or later. On the contrary, the youth generation tempered by the revolutionary Marxism-Leninism is the reliable guarantee for the continuous and victorious development of this cause.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the most sublime revolutionary virtues of the youth have been fully displayed, and in all aspects, they have shown an irresistible momentum. These virtues are: their unlimited loyalty to the revolutionary cause, their resolute struggle to break with the old and establish the new, and their boundless revolutionary enthusiasm. In the process of the development of this revolution, the Red Guard movement emerged. Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, they are the vanguard of the struggle under the leadership of the Party, dealing a heavy blow to the revisionist elements and bourgeois figures in the cultural and artistic circles, and making valuable contributions to the elimination of the extremely dangerous foreign influences in socialist culture, which are very harmful to the revolutionary and socialist cause.

The imperialists, Khrushchev revisionists, Tito revisionists, and their followers, all reactionaries, have been shouting loudly, conducting the most malicious slanders against the Red Guard movement, trying to use this to slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and defame this revolution in the eyes of world public opinion. They say that the Red Guards are just "fanatical youth." But this accusation cannot deceive the peoples and revolutionaries of various countries. Is it not the youth—the children of our people—who, when they were young, enthusiastically responded to the call of the Albanian Communist Party, left their schools and homes, took up arms to liberate their country, overthrow the old system of exploitation, and build a new socialist world? At that time, the fascist reactionaries, Ballists, and others called the national liberation struggle "child's play" and so on, they could say anything. But the revolutionary youth generation continued to advance steadfastly on the road to national liberation until victory, and now it is this generation leading the fate of our socialist homeland.

The reactionaries of various countries and modern revisionists slander the Chinese Red Guards for "destroying cultural relics and persecuting cultural figures." But did not the exploiting classes and their various lackeys call the revolutionaries who fought to overthrow the old world and create a new world without sparing any sacrifice "enemies of culture and barbarian destroyers"? Did they not use the same epithets on Lenin and the Bolsheviks who led and won the great October Socialist Revolution? Did the enemies and various reactionaries not also insult our Party and our people's government in the same way? Imperialists and revisionists only recognize the decadent culture, art, and literature of the bourgeoisie. This is why they regard the struggle against them as the negation and destruction of the entire culture. But what does history show? History shows that it is the revolutionaries who, in their merciless struggle against the reactionary old culture, on the ruins of the old culture, constantly create progressive, higher-level new culture, while preserving and further developing all the positive cultural heritage.

A mass movement like the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is irresistible, has decisive and great significance, depending on its essence and general direction, not on the individual and partial errors that some people or others may commit, which are inevitable in great revolutions in history. Individual and partial errors cannot erase the fact that the content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the People's Republic of China in the fields of education, culture, and art is to eliminate the reactionary old culture of the exploiting classes and its poison; to purify, develop, and consolidate the new proletarian culture that serves the revolution and socialism. The decision of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party points out: "At present, our goal is to overthrow the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize the reactionary academic 'authorities' of the bourgeoisie, to criticize the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, to reform education, to reform literature and art, to reform all the superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base, in order to consolidate and develop the socialist system."

In the field of culture, the overthrown exploiting classes are still resisting very stubbornly and cunningly. The victory of the new culture still requires a long, arduous, and complex struggle. The right-wing elements and revisionists in China spread bourgeois and revisionist ideas about art and culture in a hidden and very cunning manner; they maintain and loudly praise the reactionary old culture of the exploiting classes; they resist the literary and artistic principles of the proletarian party; they carry out secret activities against the Marxist-Leninist thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong; they spread revisionist poison through literary works, corrupting and poisoning the laboring people ideologically, using culture and art to prepare for political counter-revolutionary activities and the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, the struggle against these elements, to thoroughly eliminate the dangerous influence of the reactionary old culture and old art of the exploiting classes, to create revolutionary new culture and new art, to make culture and art completely serve the revolutionary and socialist cause, the laboring people, and to make them a powerful weapon for the revolutionary class education of the laboring people, is a very important component of the overall struggle between socialism and capitalism, the struggle for the complete victory of socialism over capitalism.

This new culture, which has a clear revolutionary content and resolutely rejects the reactionary essence of the old culture of the exploiting classes, is also based on the critical absorption of the progressive cultural heritage of China and the world. The revisionists vainly attempt to slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, claiming that it excludes everything foreign and the cultural heritage of the Chinese people. On this issue, Comrade Mao Zedong wrote: "...Inheritance and borrowing should not be turned into a substitute for one's own creation, this is something that cannot be substituted." He said, "In literature and art, the uncritical hard imitation and imitation of the ancients and foreigners are the most unpromising and harmful literary dogmatism and artistic dogmatism." He pointed out that it is necessary to "...critically absorb all the beneficial things from it," "to innovate." On November 28 of this year, the conference of revolutionary literary and artistic warriors held in Beijing once again emphasized Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts of "valuing the present over the past, using the past for the present, using the foreign for the Chinese," and "innovating." At the same time, Comrade Mao Zedong especially emphasized the need to criticize and resolutely resist any influence of bourgeois and reactionary culture that poses a serious danger to the socialist cause.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is being carried out according to these Marxist-Leninist thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong. Are these thoughts not completely consistent with the thoughts of Lenin? Lenin also said: "We...only take the democratic and socialist components from the culture of each nation, and we take these components only and unconditionally to oppose the bourgeois culture, bourgeois nationalism of each nation." (Lenin, *Collected Works*, Chinese edition, Volume 20, p. 7) Throughout his great revolutionary life, Lenin fought resolutely against bourgeois culture, art, and literature. He consistently defended the ideological principles of the proletarian party, fought for the creation of new culture, new art, and new literature full of proletarian thought and serving the broad masses of workers and peasants. The revisionists cannot find any basis in Lenin to support their malicious line and their anti-China slanders. Under the brilliant illumination of the teachings of Marxism-Leninism on the attitude towards the development of socialist culture, literature, and art, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is advancing, and in this extremely important field of socialist construction, it is achieving success, in order to create the most brilliant proletarian new culture, new literature, and new art in the history of mankind worthy of the great era of socialism and communism.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution makes people's thoughts and spirits revolutionary, makes tens of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, intellectuals, youth, and women broadly participate in an unprecedented creative movement, and is inspiring them to grasp and apply the great Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory of Comrade Mao Zedong in practice in the three great movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has become a powerful factor for the People's Republic of China to accelerate the development of socialist production in all aspects. In People's China, a large number of important new initiatives have emerged, which, like Dagang and Dazhai, bravely break various old concepts, old indicators, and old frameworks, and are changing the face of the country at a surprising speed.

At the same time, this is one of the greatest and most important victories: the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has strengthened the defensive forces of the People's Republic of China at an unprecedented speed in many aspects, making the entire country an invincible socialist fortress, capable of coping with and smashing any aggression from imperialism and revisionism, and capable of effectively supporting the revolutionary peoples of various countries who are fighting against oppressors and imperialist aggressors when necessary.

The cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who are loyal to the Party and the Marxist-Leninist thoughts of Comrade Mao Zedong, under the guidance of the important teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong on people's war and the role of people and weapons in modern warfare, have achieved brilliant results in tempering their political consciousness and improving their national defense preparedness. At the same time, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has given new impetus to the entire people, especially the new generation, to engage in the unremitting struggle to strengthen national defense, to comprehensively enhance physical fitness, and to make every citizen of the great China with a population of 700 million ready for military affairs.

This is the true purpose and achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution unfolding irresistibly in the People's Republic of China. It is a great historical victory of socialism in People's China, a devastating blow to the counter-revolutionary plans of American imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists against the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

For the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism and for the great contribution to the victory of revolution and socialism in the world

The successful development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great event of great historical significance. It is not only a great victory for the victory of socialism in the People's Republic of China, but also a great victory for the revolutionary, socialist, and liberation cause of the peoples of the world. This is only natural, because the People's Republic of China is now the main fortress of world socialism and the strongest pillar of the world revolution and the struggle for liberation.

In addition, the Cultural Revolution in China marks the further development of the theory and practice of socialist construction, enriching the revolutionary experience of international communism, and it is a great example that all Marxist-Leninists in the world can and should learn from. All Marxist-Leninists in the world should learn valuable lessons from it according to their own conditions to promote the socialist revolution.

The successful development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, while adhering to and consolidating the correct internationalist revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, has made great contributions to the struggle against world imperialism, first and foremost American imperialism, and the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the traitorous leadership of the Soviet Union, and to the victory of the revolutionary, socialist, and liberation cause of the peoples of various countries.

One of the fundamental purposes of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China in the international arena is to further strengthen and develop the struggle against world imperialism, first and foremost against American imperialism. The communiqué of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party pointed out: "...American imperialism is the most vicious common enemy of the peoples of the world. To isolate and strike American imperialism to the greatest extent, it is necessary to establish the broadest possible international united front against American imperialism and its lackeys." The People's Republic of China, adhering to this firm anti-imperialist revolutionary line, has waged a face-to-face struggle against American imperialism. The People's Republic of China has exposed and resolutely opposed the aggressive, warlike, and enslaving policies of American imperialism, and has become an insurmountable obstacle to the mad plan of American imperialism to dominate the world.

The fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China in the international arena is also to further strengthen the struggle against modern revisionism, first and foremost against the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union; as the documents of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party point out, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique "has betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the great Lenin, betrayed the great path of the October Revolution, betrayed proletarian internationalism, betrayed the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the oppressed peoples and nations, betrayed the interests of the great Soviet people and the peoples of socialist countries...pursuing the policy of Soviet-American cooperation to dominate the world, carrying out splitting, sabotage, and subversive activities in the international communist movement and the national liberation movement, actively serving American imperialism." In this regard, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party clearly pointed out, "To oppose imperialism, one must oppose modern revisionism." The Plenary Session fully agreed with the line of resolute and uncompromising struggle against Khrushchev modern revisionism under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong. The Plenary Session emphasized that in the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism, there is no middle road to take. Against the revisionist clique centered on the Soviet Communist Party, it is necessary to draw a clear line, resolutely expose their traitorous true face, and it is impossible to engage in any "joint action" with them. In the international united front of the peoples of the world against imperialism, it is impossible to include the Khrushchev revisionists and their accomplices, and it is necessary to unite all the revolutionary forces of Marxism-Leninism and carry the struggle against modern revisionism to the end. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line has received the enthusiastic support of hundreds of millions of laboring masses in China, who are determined to advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, raising the banner of proletarian internationalism as the highest guiding principle of its foreign policy, raising the banner of resolutely and unconditionally supporting the revolutionary peoples of various countries who are fighting for national liberation, resisting the armed aggression of American imperialism and other imperialists, is advancing. The tens of millions of people participating in this revolution have expressed their resolute support for the Vietnamese people in their just struggle to resist and completely annihilate the American aggressors, to liberate and defend their homeland. Guided by the spirit of proletarian internationalism, guided by the spirit of subordinating everything to the cause of the victory of revolution and socialism in the world, the entire laboring people are educated to use all means and at the cost of sacrifice to timely support the revolutionary forces and the struggles of the peoples of various countries. This is one of the fundamental and most outstanding features of the development of the Cultural Revolution in China.

In general, in the international arena, the fundamental goal of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is to fight selflessly and resolutely for the continuous development and victory of the world revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is an important component of the current world revolution with great significance, and it is a brilliant example for the revolutionaries and the peoples of the world. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shows how to dare to break with the old, dare to struggle, and dare to defeat all enemies. This resolute revolutionary goal is one of the fundamental reasons for the following situation: the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the Chinese Communist Party leading this Cultural Revolution, and Comrade Mao Zedong have received the sympathy and enthusiastic support of revolutionaries and the peoples of the world, while arousing the bitter hatred of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries.

The great thoughts of the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, who successfully led this revolution, are the red beacon illuminating the forward march of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The revolutionary spirit, sublime purpose, and great achievements of this revolution have enraged the revisionists, so now they are launching the most malicious attacks and slanders against Comrade Mao Zedong. Their hatred is understandable. Has anyone ever seen a revolutionary receive sympathy and love from class enemies? The revisionists are going crazy, the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line of Comrade Mao Zedong, which is to resolutely struggle against imperialism and revisionism and advance the socialist cause of China and the world revolutionary cause, has frightened the revisionists, because this line, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has made the entire fantasy of the Khrushchev revisionists and their agents in China to make the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China abandon the correct line collapse.

No matter how the revisionists curse, they cannot harm the great image of Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong is the pathfinder and great teacher of the Chinese Communist Party and the 700 million Chinese people, is the respected mentor of the international proletariat and the world revolutionary movement, and is the respected successor of the cause of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Mao Zedong Thought is the brilliant exemplar of revolutionary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought is the creative application of the fundamental doctrines of Marxism-Leninism in the great revolution of China and the socialist construction of the People's Republic of China.

Comrade Mao Zedong has made great contributions to the further development of Marxism-Leninism and scientific socialist theory. His many important theories, such as the theories on the strategic and tactical issues of people's revolutionary war, the issues of contradictions in socialist society, the issues of the development of revolutionary democracy, the issues of the mass line, the issues of the existence of class struggle in socialist society, and the measures taken to block the road to revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, have concretized Marxism-Leninism and enriched Marxism-Leninism. These theories are of extremely great significance to the revolutionary and socialist cause in China and in the world.

In the People's Republic of China, the in-depth study of the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, as a guide to action in struggle and practical work, has become a great movement. Hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, youth, women, and intellectuals have joined this movement. Therefore, the Marxist-Leninist thoughts of Mao Zedong, which have been accepted by the masses and have promoted the revolutionization of their thoughts, have become a great material force for transforming nature and society, Mao Zedong Thought has become a powerful driving force, pushing the wheels of revolution and socialist construction in the great People's Republic of China forward unceasingly.

At present, the reactionaries of various countries, led by the American imperialists, and the modern revisionists, led by the traitorous leadership of the Soviet Union, are howling like mad beasts, furiously attacking People's China, the Chinese Communist Party, and Comrade Mao Zedong. They are desperately trying to defame them and are plotting vicious conspiracies against the People's Republic of China, this main fortress of the world revolution and socialism. Therefore, the current task of all Marxist-Leninists and true revolutionaries in the world is to unite as firmly as a rock to defend Mao's China and strengthen their unity with it, to expose the anti-China slander propaganda of imperialists and modern revisionists to the peoples of various countries, and to make them suffer a thorough defeat. Comrade Enver Hoxha said at the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor: "Supporting People's China, defending it from the aggression of imperialists and their revisionist lackeys, is a historical task and a matter of life and death for all revolutionary and freedom-loving forces and peoples. Our people, our Party, and government, together with the great Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, will advance on the common revolutionary road, and in times of peace and storms, will always stand shoulder to shoulder with them, advancing together in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, for the victory of revolution and socialism."

    为什么帝国主义和修正主义联合在一起疯狂攻击  中国共产党和中国无产阶级文化大革命
    阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》编辑部
    新华社地拉那六日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》一九六六年十二月二十九日发表题为《为什么帝国主义和修正主义联合在一起疯狂攻击中国共产党和中国无产阶级文化大革命》的编辑部文章。全文如下：
    一切反革命势力——以美帝国主义者为首的帝国主义者、以苏联叛徒领导人为首的现代修正主义者和各国反动派——正在疯狂地攻击中国共产党和毛泽东同志，它们尤其对目前正在中华人民共和国胜利展开的无产阶级文化大革命进行了最疯狂的诽谤攻击。现在举着这面恶毒进行反马克思主义和反华宣传黑旗的，又是苏共叛徒领导人。
    他们为什么要这样干呢？其居心何在呢？这是因为赫鲁晓夫修正主义者从斯大林逝世以来为反对社会主义和全世界马克思列宁主义的革命运动而策划的阴谋已经遭到打击，并且正在继续遭到打击。根据毛泽东同志的教导，在中国共产党领导下开展的中国无产阶级文化大革命，是对赫鲁晓夫分子敌对阴谋的一个新的猛烈打击，因为这场大革命揭露了并正在以革命的坚决性打击隐藏在中国共产党内部的修正主义分子，消除向修正主义蜕化变质的任何可能性。
    帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的反革命阴谋已经遭到失败，并将继续遭到失败
    已经完全证实，美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为破坏社会主义和世界共产主义运动而最喜欢使用的办法之一，就是所谓“和平演变”的办法，就是依靠叛徒、修正主义分子和反革命分子，积极支持和鼓励他们从内部来攻破堡垒，赫鲁晓夫集团就是通过这个办法篡夺政权的。大家知道，隐蔽的赫鲁晓夫集团依靠官僚化的、资产阶级化的、蜕化变质的、脱离人民和反对人民的干部和知识分子阶层——这些人已经丧失革命的精神和品质，利用苏联领导在斯大林逝世后缺乏警惕性，动摇，让步，并在依靠全党、依靠群众同修正主义危险进行公开斗争方面的犹豫不决，采取政变的手法把苏联党和国家的领导权篡夺过去。赫鲁晓夫集团这样做的目的是，取消无产阶级专政，破坏苏联人民在斯大林领导下用鲜血、斗争和巨大劳动取得的社会主义成果，并且帮助其他社会主义国家的修正主义分子和叛徒照他们那样干，在他们自己的国家篡夺政权和为资本主义复辟开辟道路。
    修正主义者在苏联和其他某些社会主义国家的上台，是帝国主义者和修正主义者对工人阶级和社会主义事业所策动的最大的反革命阴谋。但是，这个阴谋的实现并不是一朝一夕的事情。这个反革命政治阴谋是修正主义者逐步策划的。在假马克思主义和假社会主义的面具和口号下面，他们着手腐蚀人们的灵魂，从思想上欺骗他们，使干部、共产党人和劳动群众丧失革命的理想，向他们灌输资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想、风俗和生活方式。这是在暗中搞的一种潜移默化的勾当，从内部瓦解和破坏社会主义制度的根基，通过日常的不易察觉的各种数量上的小变化，为发动起质的变化的反革命政变作好准备，取消无产阶级专政而代之以修正主义的专政，在国内和国际生活的一切方面推行资产阶级和资本主义的政策。　
    在这个叛变勾当中，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者得到美帝国主义，各国反动派，以及世界上的机会主义、自由主义、社会民主主义和资产阶级和平主义所有这一切逆流的全力支援和支持，它们都把修正主义者看作是它们在反对社会主义、反对革命和反对各国人民自由的斗争中的忠实同盟军和一种不可代替的工具。现代修正主义依靠一切反革命势力的积极支持，依靠社会主义国家，特别是依靠苏联的威望和力量，依靠作为“最高明”手段的蛊惑人心的伎俩，已经成了国际共产主义运动历史上空前最大的和最危险的敌人。现代修正主义者同帝国主义者，首先是美帝国主义者，以及一切反动派和工人阶级的叛徒结成同盟，向马克思列宁主义、社会主义和革命发动了全面进攻，企图使社会主义阵营和各国共产党蜕化变质和消灭，搞垮革命运动，使资本主义制度复辟并在全世界维护资本主义制度。
    但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的反革命阴谋遭到了而且也不能不遭到阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和中国共产党的坚决反对和抵抗，阿中两党之间以及它们同世界上所有兄弟的马克思列宁主义政党和一切革命的共产党人之间是存在着原则性的团结一致的，他们始终如一地忠于马克思列宁主义，并为维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，为社会主义事业的胜利而积极斗争。他们撕破了赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的“马克思列宁主义”假面具，向全世界揭露了它背叛和出卖社会主义，充当帝国主义和各国反动派的同盟军和帮凶的真面目。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者拚命想挫败这种抵抗，企图使马克思列宁主义政党屈服，因此通过各种不同的手段和方式，在政治、经济、军事和意识形态方面，特别对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和中国共产党放肆地采取敌对行动，对它们施加多方面的压力和实行猖狂的封锁，同社会主义的死敌美帝国主义者、叛徒铁托分子和印度反动派等等勾结起来对阿中两党策划阴谋。同时，为了推行修正主义，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者对我们两党大规模地进行了破坏活动，发动了他们的全部特务机构，公开支持反党和敌对分子，煽动反革命，企图从内部夺取堡垒。
    但是，由于中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和所有马克思列宁主义政党和力量采取了原则性的坚定立场并进行了原则性的坚决斗争，修正主义者接连遭到一个比一个严重的失败。修正主义者和帝国主义者对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国和中华人民共和国实行的封锁完全失败了，磐石般团结在自己的马克思列宁主义政党周围的阿中两国人民的不可战胜的力量把这种封锁粉碎了。赫鲁晓夫集团针对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和中国共产党发动的公开论战，反过来变成了一种尖锐的武器，给予了叛徒修正主义者以致命的打击，撕下了他们的假面具。这场论战加深了现代修正主义的总危机，使修正主义阵线内的重重矛盾恶化，加速了共产主义运动队伍的分化过程，划清了革命的马克思列宁主义者和叛徒修正主义者之间的界限，有助于组织马克思列宁主义的新的力量，这种新的力量已在各大洲拥有几十个政党、组织和小组。
    正是这种惨重的失败迫使苏联现领导人抛弃他们的臭名远扬的主谋人和头目赫鲁晓夫，改变斗争的伎俩和手段，戴上一些新面具，以便欺骗共产党人和各国人民，私下执行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫反革命路线。
    忠实地遵循赫鲁晓夫的路线和宗旨的、以勃列日涅夫和柯西金等为首的苏联新领导人认识到，赫鲁晓夫的“粗暴”路线，面对面斗争的路线已给修正主义者造成了不妙的结果，于是制订了主要依靠他们的隐藏起来的朋友，依靠这样一些因素和分子悄悄地进行破坏的策略。这些因素和分子在向赫鲁晓夫修正主义紧闭着大门的中国、阿尔巴尼亚和各个地方，可以成为修正主义宣传的传播者和破坏无产阶级专政的工具。而且，已成了叛徒的苏联现领导人的这些阴谋诡计，立即得到美帝国主义的支持。事实上，正当赫鲁晓夫修正主义者加紧支持隐藏的修正主义者，加紧对社会主义和马克思列宁主义运动进行破坏活动，注意鼓励会导致社会主义和无产阶级专政蜕化变质的那些因素和分子的时候，美帝国主义者及其帮凶就加紧进行武装侵略和施加军事压力。美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的这些阴谋诡计的矛头，首先是指向中华人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国以及所有不向（苏美）两大国的政策屈服的国家和马克思列宁主义政党的。
    然而，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和美帝国主义者的这种恶毒的手法同过去的手法一样遭到了失败。中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党以及所有革命的马克思列宁主义者有力地揭露了苏共新领导集团的叛徒嘴脸，从一开始就揭穿它的敌对阴谋，用种种事实证明了苏共新领导集团不仅忠实地奉行赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线，而且，比之它的已经垮台的主谋人更加危险，更加凶恶，更加狡猾。
    中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和所有真正的革命者，为揭露苏联修正主义领导人的背叛阴谋和行动而勇敢地、坚持不懈地进行的原则性斗争，使勃列日涅夫、柯西金及其同伙的集团遭到惨重失败。但是这并不是唯一的失败。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和他们的叛卖计划，遭到了另一个重大的失败，这就是他们企图迟早可以在中国或者在阿尔巴尼亚实现某种修正主义“演变”的妄想完全破灭了。
    作为真正马克思列宁主义政党的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和中国共产党，始终不渝地、勇敢地进行反对修正主义危险的斗争，不仅在对外方面，为反对作为国际共产主义运动的敌人的赫鲁晓夫、铁托等修正主义而斗争，同时在对内方面也为反对在我们国家出现修正主义的危险而斗争。修正主义在苏联和其他某些社会主义国家的出现和泛滥的情况，对于我们劳动党和中国共产党都是一个极大的教训。它告诉我们，真正的马克思列宁主义者必须同时在两条战线上开展反对修正主义叛变的斗争。这是彻底摧毁修正主义和使马克思列宁主义取得最后胜利的真正保证。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党从苏联的修正主义悲剧中汲取了教训，已经采取并将采取一切必要的措施，来根除在我国可能导致产生修正主义的迹象，杜绝修正主义者在今后篡夺政权和使资本主义复辟的危险，从而保证社会主义革命在各方面不断得到发展，直到社会主义和共产主义社会在我国完全建成。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党为此按照马克思列宁主义的学说，根据我国的具体情况，已经并且正在正确地开展阶级斗争，它不断加强党和无产阶级专政，它为反对官僚主义进行了坚决的斗争，以深入贯彻群众路线，它成功地开展了思想和文化革命，它加强了我国的防御力量，它坚决贯彻使我国整个生活革命化的路线。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党按照马克思列宁主义学说，根据我国社会主义建设的历史经验以及修正主义在苏联和在某些其他国家出现、掌握政权和泛滥的惨痛经验，接连采取了各种革命措施。所有这些措施在我们党的许多文件中，特别是在中央委员会的公开信以及党的第五次代表大会的历史性文件中得到了光辉的反映，这些措施对于叛徒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其他修正主义者企图从内部破坏和腐蚀我们党和我们社会主义国家——就像他们在自己的国家所作的那样——的妄想是一个致命的打击。我们党将进一步深入贯彻的这些革命措施，堵塞了在阿尔巴尼亚产生修正主义和资本主义复辟的道路。
    中国共产党为了巩固无产阶级专政，消除资本主义复辟和消除修正主义出现及其滋长的任何可能性，也已经和正在采取重大的革命措施，这特别体现在中国的无产阶级文化大革命的波澜壮阔的发展之中。
    苏共领导集团的赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子觉得站不住了。他们看到自己的全部计划和希望一个一个破产了，于是不管愿意不愿意，被迫把他们的主谋人和祖师爷赫鲁晓夫的“强硬”策略重新拣起来，猖狂攻击马克思列宁主义者，制订了关于召开共产主义国际会议的计划等等。这只是绝望中采取的策略，其结果如何是人所共知的。正是这条路线和这种行动使赫鲁晓夫垮了台。毫无疑问，这条路线和这种行动也将使继承赫鲁晓夫的叛徒修正主义者遭到不光采的下场。
    尽管勃列日涅夫、柯西金及其同伙把赫鲁晓夫的那些伎俩重新拣起来，但是可以看出在表面上有细微的差别。比如，赫鲁晓夫起初对马克思列宁主义发动进攻时，他公开地首先指名攻击阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，后来攻击中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，而他的继承者却在一段时间内对我们党采取保持沉默的策略，大概是妄图迫使我们党同样保持沉默，从而迫使我们党放弃对修正主义的斗争。这个恶毒的用心和它的离间阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和中国共产党的这一目的，是不难识破的。这是枉费心机。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党当时没有而且永远不会掉进这个圈套。它光荣地尽到自己的国际主义义务，并且同中国共产党和所有的真正马克思列宁主义者完全团结一致，一直坚持不懈并且一刻也不会停止它为彻底揭露修正主义者的大叛卖而进行的原则性斗争。不仅如此，它将进一步加强这一斗争，直到全部彻底粉碎赫鲁晓夫修正主义、铁托修正主义和整个现代修正主义。
    苏共修正主义领导人同美帝国主义者和其他的人勾结一起采取联合行动，现在集中全部火力攻击中华人民共和国、中国共产党和毛泽东同志，攻击在中华人民共和国展开的无产阶级文化大革命。在苏联报刊上刊载的形形色色的大量反华材料中，以《评中国的事件》为题的十一月二十七日的《真理报》编辑部文章值得注意，这篇社论是反映苏联领导集团的官方立场的，是为十二月十二日修正主义分子勃列日涅夫对中国共产党进行攻击和诬蔑的苏共中央全会事先所做的舆论准备。上述反华材料猖狂攻击中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议和毛泽东同志本人。中共十一中全会和毛泽东同志被诬蔑为犯了民族主义，沙文主义，进行分裂活动，反苏，冒险主义，破坏科学社会主义的原则，诋毁共产主义理想等等。这些材料特别辱骂无产阶级文化大革命，把这场革命说成是可怕和可恶的，说什么它不仅不符合而且公然违反列宁的学说等等。
    如果我们暂且不谈对中国文化大革命和中国共产党进行的陈腐庸俗的诬蔑，因为它们同最反动的资产阶级通讯社和报刊所刊载和宣扬的东西毫无区别，那么《真理报》的那篇社论和苏共中央全会的材料却是值得注意的，因为它们把叛徒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的忧虑和真正目的暴露在光天化日之下，暴露了他们对中国共产党和中华人民共和国策划的反革命阴谋。
    苏联修正主义领导人及其追随者攻击毛泽东同志的学说并把他的学说同马克思列宁主义对立起来，是力图攻击和抵制革命的马克思列宁主义，而另一方面却把自己的机会主义的和反革命的观点说成是“真正的和更纯洁的马克思列宁主义”。他们这样做是妄图抹煞以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党在当前的条件下捍卫和创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义思想对革命的各国人民所产生的强大影响。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者对中国的无产阶级文化大革命进行最猖狂的诬蔑，硬把这场革命同列宁关于文化革命的学说对立起来，力图诋毁这场革命的目的本身，这场革命的目的就是把文化革命作为前提来推进社会主义和共产主义事业，使修正主义根本不能在社会主义国家传播，使资本主义根本不能在社会主义国家复辟。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者妄图通过上述办法来在自己国家的共产党人和劳动人民面前为他们所奉行的导致蜕化变质的资产阶级路线辩解，并把这条路线说成是符合列宁的学说的；他们妄图制止和压制本国的广大人民和青年群众的革命觉醒，因为人民和青年群众看到中国无产阶级文化大革命这样一个活生生的榜样，这个榜样说明，人民自己，工农兵和人民知识分子怎样勇敢地站出来对修正主义分子和叛变分子大喝一声：“不准动！”怎样保卫马克思列宁主义思想，并把革命和社会主义的命运掌握在自己手里。
    叛徒苏联领导人把混进中国共产党内的、在无产阶级文化大革命中受到沉重打击的资产阶级右派分子和修正主义分子说成是“马克思列宁主义的殉难者”，公开庇护这些分子，竭力给予他们的隐藏着的代理人以“国际”支持，因为他们对这些代理人寄予这样的希望：推翻以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的革命领导，使中国共产党放弃反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的原则性的坚决斗争，使中国共产党屈服，使中国的党和社会主义制度变质，甚至把人民中国引上资本主义复辟的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者疯狂地攻击中国共产党和毛泽东同志所执行的同现代修正主义，特别是同叛变了的苏共领导——它已同美帝国主义结成一伙——进行毫不动摇的坚决斗争的路线，拚命在本国人民和世界各国人民面前为他们的反华的对外政策，为他们同美帝国主义者和形形色色的反动势力串通一起策划的敌视中华人民共和国的阴谋辩解。
    此外，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其追随者猖狂攻击文化大革命，对文化大革命散播最恶毒的谎言，不择手段地歪曲文化大革命的内容和目的，另一方面并诬蔑人民中国在国际上奉行冒险和好战的、沙文主义和种族主义的政策，他们这样做是力图在世界共产主义运动和革命运动中孤立中国共产党，在世界上孤立中华人民共和国，恫吓世界各国革命人民，离间他们同中国的友谊。
    但是，他们的反革命目的是绝对不会得逞的，而且必将遭到新的惨重失败。在中华人民共和国蓬勃展开的无产阶级文化大革命，给了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其同盟军以沉重打击，粉碎了他们从内部破坏中国共产党和人民中国、使它们脱离所遵循的马克思列宁主义正确革命路线的梦想，在中国挖掉了导致蜕化变质的修正主义和资产阶级的祸根。这就是为什么这场革命使真正的革命者和世界各国人民感到欢欣鼓舞，却引起帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派的最恶毒的咒骂、责难、诬蔑和攻击。这就充分证明了中国的文化大革命走的是正确的道路，它狠狠地打击了必须打击的对象。
    中华人民共和国所取得的社会主义的伟大历史性胜利
    社会主义建设是一个很长的革命过程，它包括对社会的整个生活的改造，对这个社会的物质生活和精神生活的改造。这个过程中的一个十分重要的任务，就是完成作为社会主义革命的一个组成部分的文化革命。马克思列宁主义的经典作家在他们的著作中强调指出了进行文化革命的必要性，认为这是建设社会主义和共产主义这个新社会必不可少的一个条件。建设社会主义的计划除了国家的工业化和农业的集体化以外，还包括要完成文化革命。列宁指出过，这一革命的根本目的，是摧毁资产阶级的文化和意识形态，创立以无产阶级的社会主义为内容的民族形式的新文化，使文化为广大人民群众所有，并培养来自劳动人民的并为他们服务的新型的知识分子。
    修正主义者为了掩饰他们的背叛和诽谤人民中国，不去一般地反对文化革命，因为这样做会露骨地暴露自己，但是他们却反对中国的无产阶级文化革命。那么，中国的无产阶级文化大革命为什么会使赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、美帝国主义者以及世界上一切反革命和反动势力这样惊慌不安呢？因为这个革命对中国社会主义的命运、对全世界的社会主义事业和革命运动来说都是一场极其重要的深刻的运动。因为中国的文化大革命是以马克思列宁主义学说为依据的，是中国共产党和毛泽东同志的创造性的运用和发展；是对中国和其他社会主义国家建设社会主义的正面经验以及修正主义在苏联和某些其他国家泛滥的反面经验的总结，所以中国的无产阶级文化大革命是对社会主义理论和实践的一个极其宝贵的新贡献。这一革命要在国内和国际上达到一系列的政治、意识形态、文化、组织和军事方面的重要目标。
    首先，中国的无产阶级文化革命清楚地表明了社会主义和资本主义之间的阶级斗争，这是每个国家在整个社会主义历史时期都存在的两条相反的道路、即社会主义道路和资本主义道路之间的严重斗争。马克思列宁主义教导我们，历史经验已经证明，并且每天都以新的事实证明了，阶级斗争在生活的各个领域——经济、政治、精神和军事等方面以各种形式在进行。列宁在概括社会主义条件下的阶级斗争的经验时曾经强调指出：“无产阶级专政是无产阶级为反对旧社会的势力和传统而进行的顽强斗争，即流血的与不流血的，强力的与和平的，军事的与经济的，教育的与行政的斗争。”（《列宁全集》中文版第三十一卷第二十六页）他指出，“在推翻资产阶级政权以后，在破坏资产阶级国家以后，在建立无产阶级专政以后，阶级斗争并不是消失（如旧社会主义和旧社会民主党中的庸人所想像的那样），而只是改变它的形式，在许多方面变得更加残酷。”（《列宁全集》中文版第二十九卷第三百五十二页）
    社会主义的敌人、社会主义国家内部和外部的旧的和新的敌人一刻不停地进行活动，企图消灭社会主义制度和复辟资本主义，为此，他们根据各种情况使用两种基本的方法，或者把两种方法结合起来，这就是：准备和发动反革命和武装侵略；使社会主义制度“和平”演变，换句话说，用“和平”的手段搞反革命。后一种方法是导致蜕化变质的修正主义方法，正像在苏联和在其他某些社会主义国家中所发生的悲剧的惨痛的经验所证实的那样，这种方法对社会主义制度来说，是一个巨大的、严重的和经常存在的危险。
    毛泽东同志强调指出：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”毛泽东同志还强调指出：“在我国社会主义革命取得基本胜利以后，社会上还有一部分人梦想恢复资本主义制度，他们要从各个方面向工人阶级进行斗争，包括思想方面的斗争。而在这个斗争中，修正主义者就是他们最好的助手。”
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命的总的根本目的，是要永远堵塞在中国出现修正主义和发生资本主义复辟的道路，使在苏联发生的悲剧不会重演，保证社会主义革命在各方面不断发展，为社会主义的彻底胜利创造可靠的保证，直到完全建成社会主义和没有阶级的共产主义社会。由此可见，文化大革命是整个社会主义革命不可分割的一部分，是社会主义革命的发展和进一步深化，是它的高级阶段。
    社会主义国家意识形态和文化领域里的阶级斗争，归根结底是争夺政权的斗争。在苏联发生的可悲经历表明，政治方面的社会主义革命，并不因为推翻了剥削阶级的政权和建立了无产阶级专政而结束，工人阶级战胜阶级敌人的这一决定性的初步胜利，不能被认为是最后的胜利，必须把这场革命继续推向前进：不断加强和完善无产阶级专政，使无产阶级专政不受官僚主义的影响，避免在资产阶级和修正主义的影响下蜕化变质，从国家机构中清除那些可能混进去破坏人民政权的暗藏的新旧反革命分子，从意识形态和政治上使所有劳动人民作好准备，用高尚的革命精神教育他们，使广大劳动群众，在党的领导下，自己承担维护和加强无产阶级专政的事业的责任，使群众对国家机关和机关工作人员实行人民的监督。这正是中华人民共和国无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的之一，即维护和加强中国的无产阶级专政，使它不致蜕变成为修正主义和资产阶级的反革命专政。这场革命的极其重大的意义就在这里。
    资产阶级和修正主义者，这些敌人，企图破坏无产阶级专政和整个社会主义制度，使资本主义复辟，把矛头首先指向马克思列宁主义的党，竭力在党内夺取权力，破坏党，使党变质，取消工人阶级的革命政党，把它变成用来达到他们反社会主义和反革命目的的一项武器。在特定的条件下，像在苏联和在其他一些国家发生的那样，存在着党丧失革命性、党官僚主义化和蜕化变质的危险。资产阶级和修正主义分子可能混进党的队伍，或者，过去多少是革命的一些人可能堕落成为修正主义分子和社会主义的敌人，他们可能爬上重要的领导岗位，并利用自己的地位来破坏社会主义革命和社会主义建设，使党脱离马克思列宁主义路线，在党内传布修正主义的观点和路线。因此，为反对这种危险而进行的斗争，对革命和社会主义的命运是极为重要的。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，是打击资产阶级和修正主义分子的这种企图的一场激烈的斗争，因为他们想使中国共产党脱离以毛泽东同志为代表的马克思列宁主义革命路线。文化革命对他们的险恶阴谋予以毁灭性的打击，它使全党更加紧密地团结在毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义的和反对修正主义的坚定路线周围，它已成了所有共产党人经受革命锻炼的大学校，它不断地使党和国家的整个生活生气勃勃和更加富于战斗性。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命最显著的特点就是：它是工农兵、青年和人民知识分子等千百万劳动群众的一个史无前例的运动，他们用毛泽东思想武装起来作为行动指南，使自己的思想革命化，使整个国家的生活革命化，在各方面——包括文化和艺术在内——发扬他们的首创精神和作出创造性努力，实行革命的全面监督。广大人民群众的这一强大的自觉革命运动，具有不可估量的重大历史意义。无产阶级文化大革命不仅在一切方面加快了中华人民共和国自力更生地进行党所领导的人民群众自己的社会主义建设事业的速度——而且这场革命筑起了一道不可逾越的墙，使那些竭力在中国传播修正主义路线、要把国家引上资本主义复辟道路的资产阶级分子和修正主义分子的敌对活动不能得逞。同在苏联发生的反面经历形成对照，中国的无产阶级文化大革命，是有积极意义的伟大的一课，表明对广大人民群众的无限信任，使他们直接积极参加革命，用马克思列宁主义思想把他们武装起来，充分发挥他们的革命首创精神。这是铲除修正主义毒草的最有效的手段，是永远堵塞资本主义在任何社会主义国家复辟的道路的最可靠的保证。
    中国的无产阶级文化革命，是广大劳动群众，特别是新生一代经受革命锻炼的大学校。这是对于社会主义的未来关系极为重大的问题，因为青年是革命的接班人，并将把革命进一步推向前进。历史经验证明，只有直接积极参加革命，才能培养后一代成为革命和社会主义事业的当之无愧的继承人，他们才能坚定不移地忠实于革命的理想，才能不畏牺牲，克服不管多大和多艰巨的一切困难和障碍，誓死捍卫和实现这种理想。不培养这样的革命的战斗的青年一代，革命和社会主义事业就没有保证，就迟早势必会失败。相反，青年一代受了马克思列宁主义的革命锻炼，就是这个事业胜利地不断向前发展的可靠保证。
    在中国的无产阶级文化大革命中，充分显示出青年的最崇高的革命品德，并且在各方面表明了锐不可挡的气势。这些品德就是：他们对革命事业无限忠诚，为破旧立新和荡涤反动的东西进行坚决的斗争，有无穷无尽的革命热情。在这场革命的发展过程中，出现了红卫兵运动，他们根据毛泽东同志的教导，在党的领导下，是斗争的先锋，给予了修正主义分子和文化艺术界的资产阶级人物以沉重打击，从而在社会主义文化中肃清对革命和社会主义事业十分危险的外来影响，作出了宝贵的贡献。
    帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义、铁托修正主义以及它们的追随者的报刊，一切反动派，大肆叫嚷，对红卫兵运动进行了最恶毒的诽谤，企图以此来诬蔑中国的无产阶级文化大革命，在世界舆论面前诋毁这场革命。他们说什么红卫兵只不过是“狂热的青年”。但是，这种责难是欺骗不了各国人民和革命者的。难道不正是青年——我国人民的儿女——年纪轻轻地就热情响应阿尔巴尼亚共产党的号召，走出校门家门，拿起武器来解放祖国，推翻旧剥削制度，建设社会主义新世界的吗？当时法西斯反动派、巴尔分子和其他分子把民族解放斗争说成是“儿戏”等等，他们什么都说得出来。但是，革命青年一代继续坚定地在争取民族解放的道路上勇往直前，直到胜利，目前，正是这一代人领导着我们社会主义祖国的命运。
    各国反动派和现代修正主义者诬蔑中国红卫兵“破坏文物，迫害文化界人士”。可是，剥削阶级及其形形色色的走狗，不是也把为推翻旧世界和创建新世界而不惜任何牺牲进行斗争的革命者叫做“文化的敌人和野蛮的破坏者”吗？他们不是用同样的称号加在领导和取得了伟大十月社会主义革命胜利的列宁和布尔什维克头上吗？敌人和各式各样的反动派不是也这样辱骂我们党和我国的人民政权吗？帝国主义者和修正主义者只承认资产阶级的腐朽文化、艺术和文学。这就是为什么他们把反对他们的斗争看做是否定和破坏整个文化。然而，历史表明了什么呢？历史表明，正是革命者在对反动的旧文化进行无情的斗争中，在旧文化的废墟上不断创造进步的、更高级的新文化，同时保留并进一步发展一切有积极意义的文化遗产。
    像中国的无产阶级文化大革命这样势不可挡的群众运动，具有决定性重大意义的是，要看它的本质和大方向，而不是看这一些人或那一些人可能犯的、在历史上伟大革命中总是难免的一些个别和局部的错误。局部的错误丝毫也抹煞不了这一事实：在中华人民共和国展开的教育、文化和艺术方面的无产阶级大革命的内容是清除剥削阶级的反动旧文化及其流毒；纯洁、发展和巩固为革命和社会主义服务的无产阶级新文化。中国共产党中央委员会全体会议的决定指出：“在当前，我们的目的是斗垮走资本主义道路的当权派，批判资产阶级的反动学术‘权威’，批判资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的意识形态，改革教育，改革文艺，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，以利于巩固和发展社会主义制度。”
    在文化方面，被推翻的剥削阶级还在非常顽固地和狡猾地进行抵抗。新文化的胜利，还得经过长期的、艰巨的和复杂的斗争。中国的资产阶级右派分子和修正主义分子以隐蔽的、十分奸诈的方式传播关于艺术和文化的资产阶级和修正主义思想；他们维护和大肆吹捧剥削阶级的反动旧文化；他们对抗无产阶级政党的文学艺术思想的原则；他们进行反对毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的秘密活动；他们通过文艺作品极力传播修正主义毒素，从思想上腐蚀和毒害劳动人民，利用文化和艺术为进行政治反革命活动、为资本主义复辟作准备。因此，对这些分子展开无情斗争，彻底肃清剥削阶级反动的旧文化、旧艺术的危险影响，创建革命的新文化新艺术，使文化和艺术完全为革命和社会主义事业、为劳动人民服务，并使之成为对劳动人民进行革命的阶级教育的强有力武器的这场斗争，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路的总的斗争、是争取社会主义全面战胜资本主义的斗争的意义极其重大的组成部分。
    具有明确的革命内容并坚决摈弃剥削阶级旧文化的反动本质的这种新文化，也是建立在有批判地吸收中国和世界的进步文化遗产的基础上的。修正主义者徒劳地力图诽谤中国的无产阶级文化革命，硬说它排斥一切外国的东西和中国人民的文化遗产。关于这个问题，毛泽东同志写道：“……继承和借鉴决不可以变成替代自己的创造，这是决不能替代的”。他说，“文学艺术中对于古人和外国人的毫无批判的硬搬和模仿，乃是最没有出息的最害人的文学教条主义和艺术教条主义”。他指出，必须“……批判地吸收其中一切有益的东西”，“推陈出新”。今年十一月二十八日在北京举行的革命文艺战士的大会再一次强调了毛泽东同志的“厚今薄古、古为今用、洋为中用”和“推陈出新”的思想。但是，与此同时，毛泽东同志特别强调必须批判和坚决反对对社会主义事业构成严重危险的任何资产阶级的和反动的文化的影响。
    中国的无产阶级文化革命正是根据毛泽东同志的这些马克思列宁主义思想进行的。难道这些思想不是完全同列宁的思想一致的吗？列宁也说过：“我们……只是为了从每个民族的文化中取出民主主义的和社会主义的成分，而取出这些成分只是并且无条件是为了同每个民族的资产阶级文化、资产阶级民族主义相对抗。”（《列宁全集》中文版第二十卷第七页）。列宁在整个伟大的革命的一生中为反对资产阶级文化、艺术和文学进行了坚决的斗争。他始终如一地捍卫无产阶级政党的思想原则，为创建充满着无产阶级思想和为广大工农群众服务的新文化、新艺术和新文学而战斗。修正主义者从列宁那里是找不到任何根据来支持他们的恶毒路线和他们的反华诽谤的。中国的无产阶级文化大革命在马克思列宁主义关于对待发展社会主义的文化、文学和艺术的态度的学说的光辉照耀下，正在向前迈进，并在社会主义建设的这个极其重要的领域里取得成功，以便创建不愧为社会主义和共产主义伟大时代的人类历史上最光辉的无产阶级新文化、新文学和新艺术。
    无产阶级文化大革命使人们的思想和精神革命化，使千百万工农兵、人民知识分子、青年和妇女广大群众投入史无前例的创造性的运动中去，正在鼓舞他们在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大运动中掌握和在实践中运用毛泽东同志的伟大的马克思列宁主义革命学说。无产阶级文化大革命已经成为中华人民共和国在一切方面加速发展社会主义生产的强大因素。在人民中国出现了大量的重要的新倡议，它们像大庆和大寨一样，勇敢地打破各种旧概念、旧指标和旧框框，以惊人的速度改变着国家的面貌。
    同时，这也是最伟大和最重要的胜利之一：无产阶级文化大革命以空前的速度在多方面加强了中华人民共和国的防御力量，使整个国家变成了社会主义的不可战胜的堡垒，能够对付和粉碎不论来自何方的帝国主义和修正主义的任何侵略，能够在必要时有效地支援正在为反对压迫者和帝国主义侵略者而斗争的各国革命人民。
    忠于党和毛泽东的马克思列宁主义思想的人民解放军的干部和战士，在毛泽东同志关于人民战争、关于在现代战争中人和武器的作用的重要教导的指导下，事事政治挂帅，已经在锻炼自己的政治思想觉悟方面和在提高保卫国家的战备方面，取得了辉煌的成果。与此同时，无产阶级文化革命给予全体人民、特别是新生一代以新的推动力，使他们投入不懈地加强国防、全面增强体质锻炼并使七亿人口的伟大中国的每个公民作好军事准备的运动。
    这就是在中华人民共和国势不可挡地展开的无产阶级文化大革命的真正目的和成果。它是社会主义在人民中国取得的具有历史意义的伟大胜利，是对美帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者针对无产阶级文化大革命策划的反革命计划的毁灭性打击。
    对反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争以及对革命和社会主义在全世界胜利的伟大贡献
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命成功的发展，是具有伟大历史意义的大事。它不仅对社会主义在中华人民共和国的胜利来说是一个伟大的胜利，而且对全世界人民的革命、社会主义和解放事业来说也是一个伟大的胜利。这是理所当然的，因为中华人民共和国现在是世界上社会主义的主要堡垒，是世界革命和争取解放运动的最强有力的支柱。
    此外，中国的文化大革命标志着社会主义建设的理论和实践的进一步发展，它丰富了国际共产主义的革命经验，它是全世界的马克思列宁主义者可以、而且应该从中吸取教益的伟大榜样，全世界马克思列宁主义者根据本国的情况从中吸取宝贵的教益，以便推动社会主义革命。
    无产阶级文化大革命在坚持和巩固以毛泽东同志为代表的正确的国际主义革命路线的同时，对反对以美国为首的世界帝国主义和反对以苏联叛徒领导为中心的国际现代修正主义的斗争、对世界各国人民的革命、社会主义和争取自由事业的胜利，作出了巨大的贡献。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命在国际方面的根本目的之一，正是在于进一步加强和发展反对世界帝国主义、首先是反对美帝国主义的斗争。中国共产党中央委员会第十一次全体会议公报指出“……美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的共同敌人。为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义，必须建立反对美帝国主义及其走狗的最广泛的国际统一战线。”中华人民共和国遵循这条坚定不移的反帝革命路线，同美帝国主义进行了针锋相对的斗争，中华人民共和国无情地揭露和坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略、好战和奴役政策，中华人民共和国成了美帝国主义实现主宰世界的疯狂计划的不可逾越的障碍。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命在国际方面的目的也是要进一步加强反对现代修正主义，首先是反对苏联修正主义领导的斗争；正如中国共产党中央委员会全体会议文件所指出的，苏联修正主义领导集团“背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了伟大的列宁，背叛了伟大的十月革命的道路，背叛了无产阶级国际主义，背叛了国际无产阶级和被压迫人民、被压迫民族的革命事业，背叛了伟大的苏联人民和社会主义各国人民的利益……奉行苏美合作主宰世界的政策，在国际共产主义运动和民族解放运动中，进行分裂、破坏和颠覆活动，积极为美帝国主义效劳。”在这方面，中国共产党中央委员会全体会议明确地指出，“要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。”全会完全同意在毛泽东同志直接领导下对赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义进行的坚决和毫不妥协的斗争的路线。全会强调指出，在马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义的斗争中，决没有中间道路可走。对于以苏共领导为中心的修正主义集团，必须划清界限，坚决揭露他们叛徒的真面目，不可能同他们搞什么“联合行动”，在全世界人民的反帝统一战线中不能包括赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其同谋，必须联合一切马克思列宁主义的革命力量，把反对现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。这条马克思列宁主义的革命路线得到几亿中国劳动群众的热烈支持，他们决心把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，高举作为中华人民共和国对外政策的最高指导原则的无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，高举坚决和毫无保留地支持为摆脱帝国主义压迫者而进行民族解放斗争、抗击美帝国主义和其它帝国主义的武装侵略的各国革命人民的旗帜，正在向前发展。参加这场革命的千百万群众，表示坚决支持越南人民在为抗击和全部彻底消灭美国侵略者，解放和保卫祖国而进行的正义斗争。本着无产阶级国际主义精神，本着一切服从革命和社会主义在全世界胜利的事业的精神教育全体劳动人民，尽一切力量、用各种办法和不惜牺牲及时支援革命力量以及各国人民的斗争，是中国的文化大革命发展的根本的和最突出的特点之一。
    总的说来，在国际方面，中国的无产阶级文化大革命的根本目标，就是为世界革命的不断发展和胜利进行忘我的坚决斗争。中国的无产阶级文化大革命是当前世界革命的具有重大意义的组成部分，对全世界的革命者和各国人民，是一个光辉的榜样。中国的无产阶级文化大革命表明怎样作才是敢于破旧、敢于斗争和敢于战胜各种敌人。这个坚决的革命目标正是发生下述情况的根本原因之一：中国的无产阶级文化大革命、领导这场文化大革命的中国共产党和毛泽东同志得到全世界的革命者和各国人民的同情和热烈支持，同时引起帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派的切齿仇恨。
    成功地领导了这场大革命的杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志的伟大思想，是照亮中国无产阶级文化大革命的前进道路的红色灯塔。这场革命的革命精神、崇高目的和伟大成就使修正主义者大怒，所以现在他们就对毛泽东同志进行了最恶毒的攻击和诬蔑。他们的这种仇恨是可以理解的。难道有人看见过革命者得到阶级敌人的同情和热爱么？修正主义者气得发疯了，毛泽东同志捍卫和执行的马克思列宁主义的革命路线，即同帝国主义和修正主义进行坚决斗争，把中国社会主义事业和世界革命事业推向前进的路线把修正主义吓坏了，因为这条路线通过无产阶级文化革命，使赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其在中国的代理人企图使中国共产党和中华人民共和国抛弃正确路线的全部幻想破灭了。
    不管修正主义者怎样咒骂，都丝毫无损于毛泽东同志的伟大形象。毛泽东同志是中国共产党和七亿中国人民的带路人和伟大的导师，是国际无产阶级和世界革命运动所敬爱的杰出导师，是马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的事业的受尊敬的继承者。毛泽东思想是革命的马克思列宁主义的光辉典范，毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的根本学说在中国的伟大革命和中华人民共和国的社会主义建设的实践中的创造性的运用。
    毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义和科学的社会主义理论的进一步发展作出了伟大的贡献，他的许多重要理论，比如关于人民革命战争的战略战术问题、社会主义社会中的矛盾问题、革命民主主义的发展问题、群众路线问题、社会主义社会中存在阶级斗争问题和为杜绝走向修正主义和资本主义复辟的道路而采取的措施问题的理论以及其他理论，都把马克思列宁主义具体化了，并且丰富了马克思列宁主义。这些理论对于在中国和在全世界的革命和社会主义事业都有极为重大的意义。
    在中华人民共和国，深入地学习毛泽东同志的著作，作为在斗争中和实际工作中的行动指南，已成为一个巨大的运动，千百万工农兵、青年、妇女和人民知识分子的广大群众都投入了这一运动。因此，已经为群众所接受、并且促使他们的思想革命化的毛泽东的马克思列宁主义思想已成为改造自然和社会的巨大物质力量，毛泽东思想已成为强大的推动力，把在伟大的中华人民共和国的革命和社会主义建设的车轮不断地向前推进。
    当前，以美帝国主义者为首的各国反动派，和以苏联叛徒领导为首的现代修正主义者，像发疯的野兽一样声嘶力竭地攻击人民中国、中国共产党和毛泽东同志，他们竭力加以诋毁，并企图通过对中国的文化大革命传播种种最恶毒的谎言来孤立人民中国，而且对中华人民共和国这个世界革命和社会主义的主要堡垒策划险恶的阴谋。因此，全世界所有的马克思列宁主义者和真正的革命者当前的任务，就是要坚如磐石地团结起来保卫毛泽东的中国，并且加强同它的团结一致，向各国人民揭露帝国主义者和现代修正主义者的反华诬蔑宣传，并使他们遭到彻底的失败。恩维尔·霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上说：“支持人民中国、保卫她免受帝国主义者及其走狗修正主义者的侵犯，是一切革命的和爱好自由的力量和人民的历史性任务和生死攸关的问题。我国人民、我们党和政府同伟大的中国人民和中国共产党在共同的革命道路上前进，无论在和平的日子里，还是在暴风雨的时刻，都将永远同他们肩并肩地站在一起，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义、争取革命和社会主义胜利的斗争中共同前进。”
