The surging tide of indignation against the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionist leadership has kept the gates of the Soviet Embassy in China shut day and night. Here, all the Chinese staff, in the face of the Soviet revisionists' frenzied suppression of our students in Europe, have roared with anger and gone on strike!

This afternoon, around 2:30 PM, nearly one hundred Chinese cooks, drivers, boiler workers, electricians, cleaners, and gardeners working at the Soviet Embassy, carrying portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, as well as portraits of Lenin and Stalin, joined the massive demonstration of revolutionary masses from various sectors of the capital.

In front of the Soviet Embassy, a driver led the chant:
	“Soviet revisionists are the chief accomplices of U.S. imperialism! To oppose imperialism, we must oppose revisionism!”
	“Down with Brezhnev! Down with Kosygin!”
	“Workers of the world, unite! Smash Soviet modern revisionism!”

Another cleaner also led the chant:
	“Revolution is justified! Rebellion is justified!”
	“Salute to our revolutionary students abroad!”
	“We must demand blood debt from the Soviet revisionists!”

This morning, the Chinese drivers, enraged by the Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocities, gathered early in the garage, filled with righteous indignation, and denounced the Soviet revisionists' new provocations. Suddenly, a Soviet staff member from the embassy entered the garage, extending his hand to shake hands with the Chinese driver Liu Jie in greeting.

	“No!” Liu Jie sat motionless, answering firmly. He still clearly remembered that this person had repeatedly forced the *Pravda* and *Izvestia*, which attacked our great leader, great party, and great people, into the garage, attempting to incite our Chinese workers. At this moment, how could he shake hands in greeting?!

	But this person still hypocritically asked, “Why?”

	“Why?! Because the Soviet military police beat our students. Beating our students is like beating us workers!”

	“That’s a rumor!”

	The drivers stood up: “No! A small clique of Soviet leaders is deceiving the people of the world!”

	This person slunk away from the garage to call for reinforcements, finding the embassy secretary in charge of general affairs. Outside the embassy office building to the west, this secretary challenged the Chinese cleaner Li Dechai: “What’s going on today?”

	“We are going on strike to protest!”

	“Why?”

	Li Dechai angrily questioned: “Why did your military police and secret agents beat our students?”

	“The news is unreliable!” the Soviet embassy secretary said.

	“Your news is unreliable. Kosygin is deceiving the people of the world!”

	That secretary even used Beijing slang, shamelessly saying: “Old Li, don’t ‘freeze’ us Soviet people!”

	“You are distorting! The friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable. Those who are desperately anti-China are Brezhnev, Kosygin, and a small clique of Soviet revisionist leaders!”

	“Good, good, good…” The Soviet secretary retreated in disarray!

	All the Chinese staff gathered at the embassy gate! After driver Liu Jie read the strike protest letter, they collectively left the embassy.

	Each one was so valiant!

	Each one was so spirited!

	Look, this team of Chinese workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought has roared and gone on strike!

	How satisfying!

	“Chinese people are not to be trifled with!”

	“We will thoroughly expose Soviet revisionism!”

	Carrying the portraits of Lenin and Stalin, the boiler workers at the forefront of the demonstration march said indignantly:

	“We admire the great teachers of the world proletarian revolution, Lenin, and the great Marxist-Leninist, Stalin. Our students in Europe were brutally suppressed by the Soviet revisionists in Moscow for paying respects to the mausoleums of Lenin and Stalin. This is a betrayal of Lenin and Stalin by the Soviet revisionist leadership! It is also an insult to the Chinese people! We are extremely indignant, and we resolutely go on strike to protest!

	“The Soviet people are the great people taught by Lenin and Stalin, with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The Soviet revisionist leadership fears that the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and Mao Zedong Thought will awaken the Soviet people. We firmly believe that the Soviet people will awaken and rise up to rebel against revisionism, seize power from the revisionist scoundrels, and the sparks of revolution against revisionism in the Soviet Union will surely blaze up, burning out the roots of revisionism.

		“One day, the red flag of Marxism-Leninism will fly high over the Kremlin, and the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will fly high over the Kremlin!”

　　无比的愤怒　坚决的反击
　　——在苏联驻华使馆工作的中国工作人员罢工纪实
    抗议苏联修正主义领导集团法西斯暴行的怒涛滚滚，苏联驻中国大使馆的大门终日紧闭。在这里工作的全体中国工作人员，面对苏修疯狂镇压我国留欧学生的血腥罪恶，怒吼了，罢工了！
    今天下午两点多钟，在苏联使馆工作的中国厨师、汽车司机、锅炉工、电工、清洁工和养花工等近百名工作人员，抬着我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，以及列宁和斯大林的画像，汇集到了首都各界革命群众声势浩大的示威行列之中。
    在苏修使馆门前，一位汽车司机领头高呼：
      “苏修是美帝的头号帮凶！反帝必须反修！”
      “打倒勃列日涅夫！打倒柯西金！”
    “全世界无产者联合起来，打倒苏联现代修正主义！”
    另一位清洁工也带头振臂高呼：
      “革命无罪，造反有理！”
      “向我国革命的留学生致敬！”
    “我们一定要向苏修讨还血债！”
    今天清晨，被苏修法西斯暴行激怒了的中国汽车司机们，一大早便聚集在车房里，义愤填膺地声讨苏修的新挑衅。忽然，一个使馆苏联工作人员走进车房，伸出手来要同中国司机刘杰握手言欢。
    “不要！”刘杰坐在那里一动不动，斩钉截铁地回答。他还清楚地记得，就是这个家伙不止一次地硬把攻击我们伟大的领袖、伟大的党、伟大的人民的《真理报》和《消息报》塞到车房，妄图煽惑我们中国工人。此时此刻，怎能握手言欢呢？！
    可是，这个家伙还假惺惺地问：“为什么？”
  “为什么？！因为苏联军警打了我们的学生。打了我们学生，就等于打了我们工人！”
    “这是谣言！”
    司机们站立起来了：“不！苏修一小撮领导人专欺骗世界人民！”
    这个家伙灰溜溜地退出车房去搬兵，找到了负责总务的使馆秘书。在使馆办公楼外的西面，这个秘书向中国清洁工李德才挑衅：“今天怎么回事？”
    “我们要罢工抗议！”
      “为什么？”
    李德才气愤地质问：“为什么你们的军警和特务打我们的学生？”
      “消息不可靠！”苏联使馆秘书说。
      “你们说的才不可靠。柯西金尽欺骗世界人民！”
    那个秘书竟然操起北京土话，厚颜无耻地说：“老李，你别‘寒呛’我们苏联人了！”
    “你这是歪曲！中苏两国人民的友谊是牢不可破的，拚命反华的是勃列日涅夫和柯西金等一小撮苏修领导！”
      “好，好，好，……”苏联秘书狼狈不堪、败阵而走！
    全体中国工作人员汇集到了使馆大门口来了！司机刘杰宣读罢工抗议书以后，他们集体离开了使馆。
    一个个是那样雄赳赳！
    一个个是那样气昂昂！
    看，这一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人的队伍，怒吼了，罢工了！
    多么大快人心！
      “中国人民是不好惹的！”
    “我们要大造特造苏修的反！”
    抬着列宁、斯大林的画像，在示威游行队伍前头行进的锅炉工们，激愤地说：
    “我们敬仰世界无产阶级革命的伟大导师列宁和伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林。我国留欧学生在莫斯科因为晋谒列宁、斯大林陵墓而遭到苏修的血腥镇压。这是苏修领导集团对列宁、斯大林的背叛！也是对中国人民的污辱！我们无比愤怒，我们坚决罢工抗议！
    “苏联人民是列宁和斯大林所教导过的、有着光荣革命传统的伟大的人民。苏联修正主义领导集团害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响、毛泽东思想的影响，会促进苏联人民的觉醒。我们坚信，苏联人民一定会觉醒，一定会起来造修正主义的反，夺修正主义混蛋的权，苏联革命造反的星星之火，一定会熊熊燃起，把修正主义的老根彻底烧掉。
      “总有一天，在克里姆林宫的上空，会高高飘扬起马克思列宁主义的红旗，高高飘扬起毛泽东思想的红旗！”　　　　新华社记者（新华社二十七日讯）
