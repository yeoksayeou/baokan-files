The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry strongly condemns the heinous crimes of U.S. aircraft bombing Vinh and the city of Thanh Hoa

The U.S. imperialist war escalation further exposes the Johnson administration's peace talks conspiracy

	Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 19th - The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 19th, strongly condemning the criminal acts of U.S. bandit aircraft continuously attacking the cities of Vinh and Thanh Hoa in North Vietnam.

	The statement said that from January 15th to 18th this year, U.S. aircraft continuously attacked the cities of Vinh and Thanh Hoa and their surrounding villages, indiscriminately bombing residential areas, government buildings, and enterprises. Many civilians were injured and killed, and many houses were destroyed. It is clear that this is a blatant new "escalation" by U.S. imperialism.

	The statement said that these heinous war crimes by U.S. imperialism show that despite suffering continuous defeats in both North and South Vietnam, it stubbornly continues to intensify and expand its destructive war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It attempts to salvage the increasingly desperate situation of the U.S. expeditionary forces and their puppet armies in South Vietnam, and further exposes the Johnson administration's deceitful "peace" and "negotiation" tactics.

	The statement said that the more ferocious and brutal U.S. imperialism becomes, the more the Vietnamese people hate it, and they are determined to fight to the end for the independence and freedom of their country, and for peace in Southeast Asia and the world.

	The statement strongly denounces the aforementioned extremely barbaric bombing by the United States and demands that the U.S. government must immediately stop its war of aggression against Vietnam, permanently and unconditionally stop bombing and all other war actions against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and withdraw all U.S. troops and their allied forces from South Vietnam.

　　越外交部强烈谴责美机滥炸越池和太原市的滔天罪行
　　美帝战争升级更暴露约翰逊政府的和谈阴谋
    新华社河内十九日电　越南民主共和国外交部十九日发表声明，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机连续袭击越南北方越池市和太原市的罪行。
    声明说，从今年一月十五日到十八日，美国飞机接连袭击越池和太原两个城市及其附近的村庄，滥肆轰炸各个居民区、机关和企业等。使许多居民伤亡，许多房屋被炸毁。十分明显，这是美帝国主义明目张胆的新的“升级”行动。
    声明说，美帝国主义的这些罪恶滔天的战争行动表明，尽管它在越南南北两方接连遭到失败，但仍然顽固地加强和扩大对越南民主共和国进行的破坏性战争，妄图挽救美国远征军和它的帮凶军在越南南方的日益窘迫的困境，并且进一步暴露了约翰逊政府的“和平”、“谈判”的狡诈手段。
    声明说，美帝国主义越疯狂、凶恶，越南人民就越仇恨它，并决心为祖国的独立和自由，为东南亚和世界的和平而战斗到彻底胜利。
    声明强烈控诉美国的上述极端野蛮的轰炸，并要求美国政府必须立即停止侵略越南的战争，永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，必须把美国军队和它的各国帮凶军全部撤出越南南方。
