In the struggle for power, be vigilant against the new counterattack by class enemies

	In many units in Shanghai, the situation after takeovers is generally good, with genuine revolutionaries in power. It has been proven that once the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the fate of the Cultural Revolution, and the fate of the socialist economy are in the hands of genuine proletarian revolutionaries, a thriving and vibrant situation emerges.

	However, the class enemies are not reconciled. Their throne for ruling the revolutionary masses is about to collapse, so they panic and go into a frenzy, engaging in fake takeovers, playing tricks, shooting from the shadows, and inciting conflicts among the masses and between the masses of different units, fishing in troubled waters. All revolutionary comrades must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, keep their eyes open, distinguish between enemies and friends, and discern right from wrong. Resolutely expose those who fan the flames from behind, directing their arrows at the dictatorship of the proletariat and the revolutionary headquarters of the proletariat, and bring them down one by one.

	There are also some power-holders who have taken the capitalist road, and some Red Guards controlled by them. They are not willing to accept their defeat, shifting from open to underground activities, changing their appearance, and masquerading as "rebels," using the banner of "revolution" to carry out takeovers, or inciting some less-awakened masses and some impostors to not acknowledge the takeovers by the rebels. Therefore, we must be vigilant and good at distinguishing between genuine and fake rebels. The political, economic, and cultural power of socialism must be in the hands of genuine revolutionaries. All power belongs to the revolutionary rebels!

	There are also some power-holders who play new tricks, saying that every office and unit needs to be taken over. They push trivial administrative work onto the rebels, making them busy with administrative tasks, thereby inciting the uninformed masses to clash with the rebels. As the editorial of the *Red Flag* magazine points out, in the face of the pressure from the revolutionary masses, they can make some fake concessions, but all these concessions, whether big or small, are attempts to strike at our dictatorship of the proletariat and maintain their power to suppress the masses. Therefore, we must be good at seeing through the enemy's fake concessions and true sabotage plots. They let us take over, then they can lie down and do nothing, idle around, and wait for an opportunity to counterattack. We must expose this big plot of theirs in time.

	1. In the struggle for power, all revolutionary rebels must unite. During the great alliance, the relationship between large and small organizations among the rebels must be correctly handled. Large organizations should not oppress small ones, and small ones should not be arrogant towards large ones. Especially, large organizations should take the initiative. At the same time, we must promptly eliminate conciliationism, reformism, factionalism, anarchism, and other bad ideological tendencies. We must be particularly vigilant against the sabotage plots of a small handful of power-holders within the Party who have taken the capitalist road, and not let them manipulate conservative organizations to seize the power of the proletariat.

	2. The takeovers of various units must be led by the internal revolutionary rebels. Revolutionary students must support all revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebels. Internal and external forces must unite, attack from both sides, and thoroughly smash the old exploitative system, the revisionist system, and the bureaucratic machinery.

	3. The struggle for power includes the establishment of new movement teams and production teams. When taking over, we must be fully prepared, especially in terms of public opinion. If the rebel forces in the unit are weak and the majority of the masses have not yet been mobilized, we must first focus on developing and strengthening the leftist forces. When taking over, we must pay special attention to key departments.

	4. Establish a "Production Supervision Committee." For some power-holders with serious errors but not class enemies, we can supervise their work and let them redeem themselves. If they cause trouble, they should be dealt with as disruptors of the Cultural Revolution. If the power-holders are already rotten, the revolutionary masses must take over the leadership, establish a "Production Supervision Committee" or a "Revolutionary Production Committee" to replace the original leadership. However, the great power must be in the hands of genuine revolutionaries.

	5. For units that have already been taken over, we must achieve both revolution and production, seriously implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production," and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of all production tasks.

    上海许多单位接管后情况大部分是好的，是真正的革命派掌了权。事实证明，那里无产阶级专政的命运，文化大革命的命运，社会主义经济的命运一经掌握在真正无产阶级革命派手里，便出现一派欣欣向荣，蓬蓬勃勃的大好形势。
    可是阶级敌人并不死心，他们赖以统治革命群众的宝座就要垮台了，于是他们惊慌失措，歇斯底里大发作，搞假接管，耍阴谋，放暗箭，挑起群众斗群众，挑起外单位的群众和本单位的群众的冲突，从中渔利。一切革命的同志，都要遵循毛主席的教导，擦亮眼睛，分清敌我，辨明是非真伪。坚决把那些在背后煽阴风、点邪火，矛头指向无产阶级专政、指向无产阶级革命司令部的家伙，一个个地揭露出来，把他们打倒。
    也有一些走资本主义道路的当权派，和一些被走资本主义道路的当权派操纵的赤卫队等，他们不甘心自己的失败，由公开转入地下，暗中活动，改头换面，冒充“造反派”，打着“革命”的旗号进行接管，或者煽动一些觉悟较低的群众和一些冒牌货来不承认造反派的接管。因此，我们应该提高警惕，善于识别真假造反派。社会主义的政治、经济、文化大权一定要掌握在真正革命派手里。一切权力归革命造反派！
    还有一些当权派，他们耍弄新的花样，什么机关什么单位都要你来接管。把无关紧要的事务工作推给造反派，让造反派整天忙于事务工作，从而挑起不明真相的群众和造反派发生冲突。正如《红旗》杂志评论员文章指出，在革命群众压力面前，他们可以做一些假让步，但是他们所做这样一些或那样一些的“让步”，都是企图打击我们无产阶级专政，保持他们压制群众的权力。因此我们必须善于识破敌人的假让步、真捣乱的阴谋。他们让我们接管了，他们便可以躺下不管，游手好闲，伺机反扑。我们必须及时戳穿敌人的这一大阴谋。
    一、在夺权斗争中，一切革命造反派要联合起来。在大联合时，要正确处理造反派中大小组织的关系问题，不能以大压小，也不能以小傲大，特别是大组织应当主动。同时要及时清除折衷主义，改良主义，山头主义，无政府主义等不良思想倾向，特别要警惕一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的破坏阴谋，不要让他们操纵的保守组织篡夺了无产阶级的大权。
    二、各单位的接管一定要以内部革命造反派为主。革命的学生一定要支持一切革命造反派的革命行动，内外联合，两面夹攻，彻底打碎旧的剥削制度、修正主义制度、官僚主义机构。
    三、夺权斗争包括组织新的运动班子和生产班子。接管时要有充分准备，要特别做好舆论上的准备。如果本单位造反派力量较弱，群众的大多数还没有发动起来，就要首先着重于发展和壮大左派队伍。接管时，要特别注意要害部门。
    四、成立“生产监督委员会”。对一些有严重错误，但不属敌我矛盾的当权派，可以监督他们工作，让他们将功赎罪。如果他们捣乱，就以破坏文化大革命论处。如果当权派已经烂掉了，革命群众一定要把领导权接管过来，成立“生产监督委员会”或“革命生产委员会”，来代替原来的领导班子。但是大权一定要掌握在真正革命派手里。
    五、已经接管了的单位，要做到革命、生产两不误，认真贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，保证完成和超额完成各项生产任务。
