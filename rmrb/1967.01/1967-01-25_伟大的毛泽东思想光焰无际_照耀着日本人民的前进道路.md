The great thoughts of Mao Zedong are boundless,
Illuminating the path forward for the Japanese people.

“The Japanese people are a great people. They will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over them for long.” This is the high praise given by Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, to the Japanese people who are bravely waging a just patriotic struggle against American imperialism. It is like a brilliant red flag and a shining beacon, inspiring and guiding the great Japanese people to victory in their just patriotic struggle against American imperialism!

Mao Zedong's words are forever etched in the hearts of the Japanese people

Three years ago, on January 27, when the Japanese people were vigorously advancing their patriotic struggle against American imperialism, centered around opposition to American military bases, and when the anti-American patriotic united front of all strata of the people was expanding, Chairman Mao delivered a speech in Beijing supporting the just patriotic struggle of the Japanese people. This speech was immediately broadcast over the radio to Japan. The broad masses of the Japanese people, who had just participated in the “January 26” anti-American mass demonstrations at more than forty American military bases, were extremely excited to hear the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao. They could hardly contain their excitement. They truly felt that the great Chairman Mao and the 700 million Chinese people were standing behind them, adding boundless courage and strength to their struggle.

In Tokyo, a train driver working at a freight station recalled the scene at that time and said to a Chinese reporter, “That night, I was waiting in the duty room to take over my shift. I turned on the radio in the room and heard the announcer broadcasting Chairman Mao's speech. I was so excited that I quickly moved the radio to another room where more than ten train drivers were resting. When they heard that the broadcast was Chairman Mao's speech, the room immediately fell silent. The announcer's voice was louder and more emotional than usual. When we heard Chairman Mao say, ‘American imperialism must get out of Japan, out of the Western Pacific, out of Asia, out of Africa and Latin America...’ we were so excited that it felt like a surge of warmth coursing through our entire bodies. We felt that Chairman Mao was saying exactly what the Japanese working class and all the Japanese people wanted to say, and what was in the hearts of all the people of the world. These words illuminated the hearts of the revolutionary Japanese people.”

This railway worker said, “Chairman Mao is the great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great navigator of the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and all the people of the world. Although Chairman Mao's speech was delivered three years ago, it is still etched in our hearts. Chairman Mao pointed out, ‘American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese people.’ We, the Japanese working class, understand this the most. We must stand at the forefront of the patriotic struggle against American imperialism, strike at American imperialism, and at the same time strike at modern revisionism, to drive American imperialism out of our country as quickly as possible and eliminate it from the world.” After this worker spoke to the Chinese reporter, he also wrote a letter. At the end of the letter, he wrote “Long live Chairman Mao!” ten times.

Chairman Mao believes in the Japanese people, and the Japanese people believe in Chairman Mao even more

On the eve of the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's historic speech, many study groups and research groups in Japan that study Chairman Mao's works studied and discussed this great document. In the course of their study, the broad masses of Japanese friends felt even more strongly the correctness of Chairman Mao's judgments and loved and revered Chairman Mao even more. An old farmer who had long been involved in the revolutionary movement said at a “Study Group on the Works of Chairman Mao” in the suburbs of Tokyo: Chairman Mao believes in us, and we believe in Chairman Mao even more. Chairman Mao pointed out, “The Japanese people are a great people. They will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over them for long.” This is a great encouragement to us Japanese people, and at the same time, it is the greatest trust that Chairman Mao has in us Japanese people. Chairman Mao is a true great proletarian revolutionary, who firmly believes that the masses will definitely liberate themselves.

Many participants in the study sessions felt deeply from their own personal experiences of struggle that Chairman Mao, in this speech, proposed the idea of uniting all strata of the Japanese people to form a patriotic united front against the aggression, oppression, and control of American imperialism, which is a Marxist-Leninist wise judgment that conforms to the actual situation in Japan, pointing out the direction of the struggle of the Japanese people.

A young worker said at a study session, Chairman Mao teaches us, “Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution.” Since the war, American imperialism has been oppressing us politically, economically, and militarily, and it is our number one enemy, as well as the number one enemy of the people of the world. Therefore, we must not only form a broad patriotic united front within the country, but also form an anti-American united front internationally, and wage a resolute struggle against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries.

At this study session of Chairman Mao's works, the speakers unanimously pointed out in anger that the followers of Soviet modern revisionism in Japan are afraid of revolution, oppose revolution, and are trying to lead the mass movement in Japan down the path of surrendering and capitulating to American imperialism. These followers also distort the content of the international united front, using the so-called joint support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people as a pretext to advocate joint action with Soviet revisionists, opposing great socialist China, and serving the policy of US-Soviet cooperation. The speakers believe that in today's situation, reviewing Chairman Mao's speech is of special and important significance.

A teacher said: The “January 26” anti-American struggle, which Chairman Mao praised as a “great patriotic movement,” was specifically about opposing American military bases in Japan. This is the most effective struggle against American imperialism. Such a struggle has great significance in supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression today. However, the modern revisionists in Japan have long abandoned this struggle.

To oppose the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, we must also oppose the Soviet revisionists and their followers

The great Japanese people have boundless revolutionary enthusiasm. They resolutely oppose the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. They want revolution. The path of the Japanese people to seek independence and liberation is unobstructed by any force. A small handful of modern revisionists have abandoned the anti-American banner, but the revolutionary masses in Japan are holding it higher and higher. The revolutionary masses in Yamaguchi Prefecture, on the eve of the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's great speech, began a week-long continuous anti-American demonstration march from Shimonoseki to the U.S. military base in Iwakuni, one of the largest in Japan, while the followers of Soviet modern revisionism in Japan were intoxicated with the House of Representatives election campaign. The young people in the march carried red flags with the words “Long live Chairman Mao!” “Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!” and banners reading “Yankees go home!” “Oppose American aggression in Vietnam!” “Down with modern revisionism!” They received enthusiastic support and response from the broad masses of people of all strata along the way.

The revolutionary masses in Yamaguchi Prefecture, in October last year, at the anti-American mass demonstration organized by the “County Citizens' Conference to Abolish the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty” around the U.S. military base in Iwakuni, for the first time carried propaganda signs with a portrait of Chairman Mao and a quotation from Chairman Mao, “Rebellion is justified,” and marched forward with their heads held high, making the American imperialists and a small handful of followers of Soviet modern revisionism in Japan tremble with fear.

More and more people have seen through the ugly face of a small handful of followers of Soviet modern revisionism who have betrayed the Japanese people. Countless facts have educated people, making them realize the truth that to oppose American imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism. The genuine forces in Japan that are truly striving for national independence are rapidly gathering and growing stronger. A new high tide of a broader just patriotic struggle against American imperialism is sure to come.

As Chairman Mao pointed out in this speech three years ago: “The Chinese people firmly believe that the Japanese people will definitely be able to drive the American imperialists out of their own country, and the Japanese people's desire for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will definitely be realized.”

Long live the great just patriotic struggle of the Japanese people! (According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tokyo on the 24th)

### 伟大的毛泽东思想光焰无际　照耀着日本人民的前进道路

　　伟大的毛泽东思想光焰无际
　　照耀着日本人民的前进道路
      “日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”这是中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席对正在进行英勇的反美爱国正义斗争的日本人民的高度评价。它像一面鲜艳的红旗、一座明亮的灯塔，鼓舞和指引着伟大的日本人民在反美爱国正义斗争的道路上胜利前进！
        毛主席的话永远印在日本人民的心坎上
    三年前的一月二十七日，正当日本人民以反对美军基地为中心的反美爱国斗争蓬勃开展、各阶层人民反美爱国统一战线不断扩大的时候，毛主席在北京发表了支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话。这一谈话，通过电台广播立即传到日本。刚刚在四十多个美军基地参加过“一·二六”反美大示威的日本广大群众，无比兴奋地听到伟大领袖毛主席的声音，人人难以抑制住心中的激动。他们真正感到伟大的毛主席和七亿中国人民站在他们的背后，增添了无限的斗争的勇气和力量。
    在东京一个货运车站工作的火车司机回忆着当时的情景对中国记者说，那天晚上，我正在接班室等候接班。我把室内的收音机打开一听，播音员正在广播毛主席的这个谈话。我激动地赶忙把收音机搬到有十多名火车司机在休息的另一间屋子。他们听说广播的是毛主席的谈话，室内马上肃静下来。播音员的声音，比平时更响亮，感情更充沛。当我们听到毛主席说：“美帝国主义从日本滚出去，从西太平洋滚出去，从亚洲滚出去，从非洲和拉丁美洲滚出去，……”的时候，我们激动得就像一股热流通遍全身。我们感到毛主席说的正是我们日本工人阶级和全体日本人民要说的话，也是全世界人民心中的话。这些话照亮着革命的日本人民的心。
    这位铁路工人说：“毛主席是中国人民的，日本人民的，也是全世界人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手。毛主席的谈话发表虽已三年，至今仍印在我们的心坎上。毛主席指出，
  ‘美帝国主义是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人。’我们日本工人阶级体会最深。我们要站在反美爱国斗争的最前头，打击美帝国主义，同时打击现代修正主义，把美帝国主义从我们的祖国尽快地赶出去，从世界上消灭掉。”这位工人在向中国记者发表谈话之后，又写来一封信。他在信的结尾写“毛主席万岁”时，一连写了十个“万岁！”
        毛主席相信日本人民，日本人民更相信毛主席
    在毛主席的具有历史意义的谈话发表三周年前夕，日本有许多学习毛主席著作的小组、研究会，学习和讨论了这一伟大文件。在学习中广大日本朋友，愈加感到毛主席论断的正确，越发热爱、敬仰毛主席。一位很早就参加革命运动的老农民，在东京郊区一个“毛主席著作研究会”上说：毛主席相信我们，我们更相信毛主席。毛主席指出，“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”这是对我们日本人民的无限鼓励，同时是对我们日本人民的最大信任。毛主席是真正的伟大的无产阶级革命家，他坚定不移地相信：人民群众一定会自己解放自己。
    许多参加学习的人，都从自己切身斗争经验中，深深地感到毛主席在这次谈话中，提出的日本各阶层人民结成反对美帝国主义侵略、压迫和控制的爱国统一战线的主张，是符合日本实际情况的马克思列宁主义的英明论断，指出了日本人民斗争的方向。
    一位青年工人在一个学习会上说，毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”战后，美帝国主义从政治上、经济上、军事上一直压迫着我们，它是我们的头号敌人，也是世界人民的头号敌人。因此，我们不但要在国内结成广泛的爱国统一战线，还要在国际上结成反美统一战线，同美帝国主义、现代修正主义、反动派进行坚决的斗争。
    在这次毛主席著作学习会上，发言者一致愤怒指出，苏联现代修正主义在日本的追随者，害怕革命，反对革命，正在力图把日本的群众运动引向屈服和投降美帝国主义的道路上去。这些追随者并且歪曲国际统一战线的内容，以所谓共同支援越南人民斗争为名鼓吹同苏联修正主义者搞“共同行动”，反对伟大的社会主义中国，为美苏合作政策服务。发言者认为在今天的形势下，重温毛主席的谈话，更有其特别的重要的意义。
    一位教师说：被毛主席称赞为“一次伟大的爱国运动”的“一·二六”反美斗争，是以反对美国在日本的军事基地为具体内容的，这是反对美帝国主义最有效的斗争。这种斗争，在当前对支援越南人民反对美国侵略战争更有其重大的作用。然而日本的现代修正主义者却早就放弃了这种斗争。
        反对美日反动派必须反对苏修及其追随者
    伟大的日本人民有着无限的革命热情，他们坚决反对美日反动派，他们要革命。日本人民争取独立、解放的道路是任何势力也无法阻挡的。一小撮现代修正主义者抛弃了反美的旗帜，而日本革命群众，却把这面旗帜越举越高。山口县的革命群众，在毛主席这一伟大谈话发表三周年前夕，在苏联现代修正主义在日本的追随者们陶醉于这次的众议院选举运动的时候，从一月二十一日起，开始了从下关到美国在日本最大的军事基地之一岩国的持续一周的反美示威游行。游行的青年打着写有“毛主席万岁！”“中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”的红旗；打着“美国佬滚回去！”“反对美国侵略越南！”“打倒现代修正主义！”等标语牌，受到沿途各阶层广大人民的热烈支持和响应。
    山口县革命群众，去年十月，在“废除日美安全条约县民会议”组织的、在美军岩国基地周围举行的反美大示威中，第一次打出了挂有毛主席画像和写有毛主席语录“造反有理”的宣传牌，昂首阔步前进，使得美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义在日本的一小撮追随者胆颤心惊。
    越来越多的人，看清了一小撮苏联现代修正主义的追随者背叛日本人民的丑恶面目。无数事实教育了人们，使他们认识到反美必须反修的道理。在日本真正争取民族独立的爱国力量，正在迅速集结、壮大。一个规模更加广泛的反美爱国正义斗争的新高潮必将到来。
    正如毛主席在三年前发表的这次谈话中所指出：“中国人民深信，日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义者从自己的国土上驱逐出去，日本人民要求独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望，一定能够实现。”
    日本人民伟大的反美爱国正义斗争胜利万岁！　（据新华社东京二十四日电）
