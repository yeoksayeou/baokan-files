The revolutionary rebel workers of the Hefei Evening News Printing Plant, after seizing power from a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and diehard elements stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, have been promoting revolution and production. They have successfully completed the glorious task of printing "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

The revolutionary rebel workers of this plant have established a Revolutionary Rebel United Committee and resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." However, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and diehards stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line in the plant are not willing to accept their downfall. They used counter-revolutionary revisionist economism to incite some deceived workers, saying things like "no work, full pay," and instigated a portion of the workers to leave their production posts to organize delegations to go to Beijing to "make complaints." Even more vile, they attempted to sabotage the printing of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," intending to blame the revolutionary rebel workers for the failure.

The revolutionary rebel workers heed Chairman Mao's words the most. They have a deep affection for printing "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and are determined to let more people grasp Mao Zedong Thought. They overcame the difficulties of manpower shortages and various technical problems. One group went from having more than twenty people to being reduced to just one person. But the revolutionary rebel workers fought day and night, forgetting to sleep, by the workbench. The various workshops in the plant cooperated closely and supported each other. Retired worker Li Guanglan, seeing the plant so busy with revolution and production, also rushed to the plant to help. She said, "I also want to contribute to the Cultural Revolution!" Originally, this plant could only print more than six thousand copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" per day, but now it has increased to more than nine thousand copies per day, with the highest daily output reaching more than thirteen thousand copies. The revolutionary rebel workers have unlimited love for Chairman Mao and are very enthusiastic about production. Recently, they completed the printing of 180,000 copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" six days ahead of schedule, ensuring both quality and quantity.

　　合肥晚报印刷厂革命造反派工人夺权后坚持抓革命促生产
　　出色完成《毛主席语录》印制任务
　　粉碎了一小撮坏家伙挑动部分工人离开生产岗位的阴谋
    新华社合肥二十四日电　合肥晚报印刷厂的革命造反派工人，从一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手里夺取了工厂的领导权后，抓革命，促生产，出色地完成了印制《毛主席语录》的光荣任务。
    这个厂的革命造反派工人，成立了革命造反派联合委员会，坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。但是这个厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，并不甘心自己的垮台，他们用反革命修正主义的经济主义来煽动一些受蒙蔽的工人，说什么“不上班，工资照发”，挑动一部分工人离开生产岗位，组织什么代表团上北京“告状”。更为恶毒的是，他们企图使印制《毛主席语录》的任务完不成，用这来嫁祸于革命造反派工人。
    革命造反派工人最听毛主席的话，他们对印制《毛主席语录》有着深厚的感情，决心让更多的人掌握毛泽东思想。他们克服了人手不足和技术上的许多困难。有一个组从二十多人少到只剩下一个人。但革命造反派工人夜以继日、废寝忘食地在工作台旁战斗。厂里各车间展开了大协作，互相支援。已经退休的老工人李光兰，看到厂里革命和生产这样忙，也赶到厂里来帮忙，她说：“我也要为文化大革命出一分力！”原来这个厂每天只能印制六千多本《毛主席语录》，现在每天提高到九千多本，最高日产量达到一万三千多本。革命造反派工人们对毛主席无限热爱，生产劲头很大，最近提前六天保质保量完成了十八万本《毛主席语录》的印制任务。
