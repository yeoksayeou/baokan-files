The Fourth Heroic Model Conference of North Vietnam was recently held in Hanoi.

This heroic model conference was held at a time when the Vietnamese military and people are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to arms, vigorously promoting the anti-American national salvation competition, and achieving great victories. More than 500 heroes and representatives from various regions, provinces, and cities in North Vietnam, including combat heroes, labor models, and representatives from various regions, departments, and "decisive" units, gathered to celebrate the glorious achievements of both North and South Vietnam and to determine to defeat the American aggressors.

Attending the opening ceremony were Chairman Ho Chi Minh, Vice Chairman Ton Duc Thang, and other Vietnamese party and government leaders such as Le Duan, Vo Nguyen Giap, Pham Van Dong, Vo Nguyen Giap, Nguyen Duy Trinh, Le Quy Don, Phan Khac Suu, and Tran Huy Lieu, as well as Nguyen Van Tien, the head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to North Vietnam.

Chinese Ambassador to Vietnam Zhu Qifeng and diplomats from various countries in Vietnam were also invited to attend the opening ceremony.

In an atmosphere filled with victory and joy, Chairman Ho delivered a speech. In his speech, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the National Assembly, and the Government, he extended a warm welcome to the representatives present. He also, on behalf of all the representatives at the conference, extended cordial congratulations to the heroic people and soldiers of the South. He praised the Vietnamese people as a heroic people and praised their great victories in the struggle against the American imperialist aggressors.

Le Quy Don, member of the Politburo of the Vietnamese Labor Party, Vice Premier of the Government, and Chairman of the Central Competition Commission, delivered a lengthy report at the conference.

Le Quy Don said: "After two years of anti-American national salvation competition, it has been clearly demonstrated that our military and people are fighting stronger and winning more. The people of the North have shattered the American bandits' various 'escalations' of destructive war, are more convinced than ever that they will achieve final victory, have strengthened their fighting will, and are more fully committed to supporting their fellow countrymen in the South."

He said: "Our glorious victories have shown that under the wise leadership of the Party headed by beloved Chairman Ho Chi Minh, our military and people have a strong revolutionary tradition, an invincible fighting spirit, and a great creative potential for labor; they have shown the superiority and vitality of the socialist system; they have shown the invincible power of people's war. They herald the complete victory of our people."

Le Quy Don summarized many valuable experiences from the anti-American national salvation competition over the past two years since the last heroic model conference in his report, and enthusiastically praised the revolutionary heroism of all military and people.

He then pointed out: The situation of American imperialism and its lackeys is becoming increasingly difficult, and they, like a heavily injured beast, will still struggle desperately. At present, American imperialism and its lackeys are stepping up their plots to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. All military and people of Vietnam must further heighten their revolutionary vigilance and fighting spirit and make greater and redoubled efforts. He emphasized: "Our task in the North is to promote people's war, achieve national defense, firmly defend the North, defeat the enemy's destructive war, and be well prepared to defeat them if the enemy expands the local war to the North. While fighting, to ensure victory, we must promote the construction of the material and technological foundations of socialism in the North. At the same time, we must wholeheartedly support the liberation revolutionary cause of our fellow countrymen in the South until final victory."

Le Quy Don stressed in his report: Chairman Ho's great call to arms issued last July "is the sacred call of our beloved country, the urgent requirement of our heroic country. It is the stirring charge issued by the supreme leader, inspiring our military and people to press forward bravely and decisively defeat the American aggressors."

Le Quy Don said, all military and people of North Vietnam must compete with the military and people of the South. We must learn from the firm will and courageous, resourceful, proactive, and hardworking spirit of the military and people of the South.

Le Quy Don said, our conference solemnly reaffirms: We would rather die than be slaves, and we are determined to carry out Chairman Ho's call to arms!

Le Quy Don finally called on the military and people of Vietnam to highly carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, push the anti-American national salvation competition to a new high, and advance bravely towards victory! Great victory awaits us!

    越南北方英雄模范大会在河内举行
    胡志明主席赞扬越南人民抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利
    据新华社河内六日电  越南北方第四次英雄模范大会，最近在河内市隆重举行。
    这次英雄模范大会，是在越南军民正在热烈响应胡志明主席的战斗号召、大力促进抗美救国竞赛运动、并且取得了巨大胜利的形势下召开的。来自越南北方各区、省、市的英雄儿女，包括战斗英雄、劳动模范，各地区、各部门和“决胜”单位的代表，共五百多人聚会一堂，欢庆越南南北两方的辉煌战功，决心战胜美国侵略强盗。
    出席大会开幕式的有胡志明主席、孙德胜副主席和黎笋、长征、范文同、武元甲、阮维桢、黎清毅、潘继遂、陈国环等越南党政领导人，以及越南南方民族解放阵线常驻北方代表团团长阮文进等。
    中国驻越南大使朱其文和各国驻越南外交使节，也应邀出席了大会的开幕式。
    胡主席在全场洋溢着胜利和欢乐的气氛中，发表了讲话。胡主席在讲话中代表党中央、国会和政府，向到会的代表表示热烈欢迎。他还代表大会全体代表，向英雄的南方人民和战士表示亲切的祝贺。他赞扬越南人民是英雄的人民，并赞扬他们在反对美帝国主义侵略者的斗争中所取得的伟大胜利。
    越南劳动党中央政治局委员、政府副总理、中央竞赛委员会主任黎清毅在大会上作了长篇报告。
    黎清毅说：“经过两年的抗美救国竞赛，突出地表明了这样的雄辩的事实：我国军民越战越强，越战越胜。”“北方军民粉碎了美国强盗破坏性战争的各次‘升级’，更加相信一定取得最后的胜利，增强了战斗意志，更加全心全力支援骨肉的南方同胞。”
    他说：“我们所取得的辉煌胜利，表现了在以敬爱的胡志明主席为首的党的英明领导下，我国军民的坚强的革命传统、必胜的战斗力和伟大的创造性的劳动潜力；它说明了社会主义制度的优越性和蓬勃的生命力；说明了人民战争的无敌威力。它预示着我国人民将取得彻底的胜利。”
    黎清毅在报告中总结了自上次英模大会后两年来抗美救国竞赛中的许多宝贵经验，热烈地赞扬全体军民的革命英雄主义精神。
    他接着指出：美帝国主义及其走狗处境日益窘迫，它们像受了重伤的猛兽一样，还要进行疯狂的挣扎。目前，美帝国主义及其走狗正在加紧推行加强和扩大侵越战争的阴谋。越南全体军民必须进一步提高革命警惕性和战斗意志，必须作出更大的和加倍的努力。他强调说：“我们北方的任务是：促进人民战争，实现全民国防，坚决保卫北方，打败敌人的破坏性战争，积极准备好在敌人把局部战争扩大到北方的情况下打败它们。在进行战斗的同时，为了保证胜利，我们必须促进北方的社会主义物质和技术基础的建设。同时全心全力支援南方同胞的解放革命事业，直到彻底胜利。”
    黎清毅在报告中强调说：胡主席在去年七月间发出的伟大战斗号召“是可爱的祖国的神圣号召，是英雄的祖国的迫切要求。这是最高领袖发出的雄壮的冲锋令，鼓舞着我国军民勇往直前，决战决胜美国侵略强盗。”
    黎清毅说，越南北方全体军民必须和南方军民展开竞赛。必须学习南方军民的坚强意志和英勇机智、主动进攻和克服困难的精神。
    黎清毅说，我们大会庄严地重申：宁死不当奴隶，决心实现胡主席的战斗号召！
    黎清毅最后号召越南军民高度发扬革命英雄主义精神，把抗美救国竞赛推向新的高潮，向胜利奋勇前进！伟大的胜利在等待着我们！
