		Editor's Note by Xinhua News Agency: Recently, workers in various places have followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, starting from the overall interests of our socialist country and from the fundamental interests of carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They have resolutely resisted the new tricks of economic opportunism played by a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. They have resolutely returned or refused to accept various economic bribes, dealing a heavy blow to the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. They have done the right thing and done it well, showing the heroic spirit and high political awareness of our country's proletariat, who are wholeheartedly for the revolution and everything for the people. This situation shows that a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, who try to use a set of economic opportunist filth to obstruct the surging advance of the Cultural Revolution, are doomed to fail.

		Worker Xue Baorong from the materials warehouse of Hangzhou Locomotive Depot resolutely resisted economic opportunism and returned all the so-called "back pay" that the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the depot tried to bribe the workers with to the state. This news quickly spread throughout the entire Hangzhou Locomotive Depot. Many revolutionary rebel workers shook Xue Baorong's hand, praising him for doing the right thing and doing it well!

		A few days ago, the financial department of Hangzhou Locomotive Depot gave Xue Baorong a sum of "back pay." Someone told him that the depot would also give workers back pay for bonuses. Xue Baorong felt the "back pay" in his pocket, a bit confused. At this time, his child was in the hospital having surgery, and his family urgently needed money. Should he take this back pay? Should he go to receive the other back pay for bonuses? Xue Baorong thought and struggled repeatedly. He suddenly looked up and saw a slogan on the wall: "Chairman Mao's works are a treasure, indispensable for revolutionary work. When problems arise, consult them, and you'll have a red heart and bright eyes with high spirits!" He immediately opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The golden instructions of the Chairman shone in his eyes: "Everything from the interests of the people, not from the interests of individuals or small groups."

		Chairman Mao's words illuminated Xue Baorong's heart. His vision became sharper. He thought, why did the depot leaders, when we workers had just started to expose their problems and had not yet gone through the first and second rounds of struggle, hurriedly give workers back pay? Isn't this clearly using state funds to buy people's hearts, diverting the direction of the struggle, and leading us down the wrong path of economic opportunism? Isn't this an attempt to use money to silence us and stop us from revolting? No, absolutely not! We revolutionary rebels are wholeheartedly for the revolution and everything for the people. We must not fall for the tricks of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. We must not let their plots succeed. He decided not only not to go to receive any back pay for bonuses but also to return all the back pay he had already received. He said, "To hell with 'material incentives' and 'money as the commander'!"

    造反不为钱
    一心为革命
    新华社编者按：最近，各地许多工人遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，从我们社会主义国家的全局利益出发，从把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的根本利益出发，坚决地抵制了一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的人玩弄的经济主义的新花招。他们坚决退回或拒绝接受种种经济收买，给了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑以沉重的打击。他们做得对，做得好，表现了我国工人阶级一心为革命，一切为人民的英雄气概和高度的政治觉悟。这种情况表明，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，妄图搬出一套经济主义的肮脏货色来阻挡文化大革命洪流的汹涌前进，是注定要失败的。
    杭州机务段材料库工人薛宝荣坚决抵制经济主义，把段内走资本主义道路的当权派收买工人的所谓“补发工资”全部退还给国家了。这个消息很快传遍了整个杭州机务段。许多革命造反派职工拉着薛宝荣的手，连声称赞他做得对，做得好！
    几天前，杭州机务段的财务室发给薛宝荣一笔“补发工资”。有人告诉他，段上还要给工人补发奖金。薛宝荣摸着口袋里的“补发工资”，有点摸不着头脑。这个时候，薛宝荣的小孩正住在医院里动手术，家中急需钱用。这笔补发工资拿不拿？另外一笔补发奖金去不去领？薛宝荣反复思考着，斗争着。他猛一抬头，看见墙上写着一条标语：“毛主席著作是个宝，革命工作不可少，有了问题去请教，心红眼亮干劲高！”他马上打开《毛主席语录》，金光闪闪的主席指示，映入了他的眼帘：“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。
    毛主席的话，照亮了薛宝荣的心。他的眼光更尖锐了。他想，为什么段领导在我们工人刚刚起来揭发领导的问题，还没有一斗、二批的时候，他们却急急忙忙地给工人补发工资呢？这不是明摆着慷国家之慨，收买人心，转移斗争的大方向，把我们引向经济主义的邪路上去吗？这不是妄想用金钱来糊我们的嘴，不要我们革命吗？不能，绝对不能！我们革命造反者一心为革命、一切为人民，决不能上一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的当，决不能让他们的阴谋得逞。他决定不但不去领什么补发奖金，就是已经领来的补发工资也坚决全部退回去。他说，什么“物质刺激”、“钞票挂帅”，见他妈的鬼去吧！　　　（新华社杭州电）
