President Nyerere of Tanzania has called for vigilance against imperialist plots to subvert Africa. He stressed that only the people are an invincible force. Tanzanian people demonstrate in support of the government's expulsion of British colonialists.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Dar es Salaam, the *Nationalist* recently reported that on the 16th, Tanzanian President Nyerere, in a speech, pointed out that the soldiers and intellectuals of African countries must be on guard against the imperialists' attempts to infiltrate the armed forces and intellectual circles of African countries. He warned that imperialists are plotting a new neocolonialist offensive against Africa, aiming to undermine the governments of progressive African countries.

President Nyerere made these remarks while addressing the officers and soldiers of the Fifth Battalion of the Tanzanian People's Defense Force in Tabora, central Tanzania.

He further emphasized, "Without economic independence, there can be no true independence. Africa is not yet free because colonialists are still exploiting our countries."

President Nyerere also explained the fundamental difference between the armies of independent African countries and colonial armies. He told the soldiers, "The people, and only the people, are the invincible force of our country. The army must serve them without reservation." He said, "Our leaders, the army, and party cadres must all serve the people."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Dar es Salaam on the 21st, local newspapers reported that in recent days, thousands of Africans in the southeastern province of Mtwara held demonstrations supporting the government's expulsion of two British colonialists.

The two expelled British colonialists were Robert, the manager of a hotel in Mtwara town, and a female "teacher" at Manganba School in Mtwara province. According to reports, they were expelled for violating Tanzanian government policies.

Demonstrators held up signs condemning colonialists. During the demonstration, a dummy of the British colonialist Robert was burned in public. As the dummy turned to ashes, the crowd shouted slogans and danced.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency from Dar es Salaam, the Tanzanian newspaper *Nationalist* published a commentary on the 20th, calling on the African people to be particularly vigilant against imperialist publications in Africa. The commentary stressed that imperialist newspapers are tools used by imperialists to subvert African countries.

    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　据《民族主义者报》最近报道：坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔十六日在一次演说中指出，非洲各国的士兵和知识分子必须对帝国主义者千方百计地企图渗入非洲各国的武装部队和知识界的阴谋提高警惕。他警告说，帝国主义者正在策划对非洲发动新殖民主义的攻势，妄图搞垮进步的非洲国家的政府。
    尼雷尔总统是在坦桑尼亚中部塔波拉向坦桑尼亚人民国防军第五营的官兵发表演说时讲这番话的。
    他还强调说：“没有经济的独立，就不可能有真正的独立。非洲还没有自由，因为殖民主义者仍然在剥削我们的国家。”
    尼雷尔总统还阐述了非洲独立国家的军队同殖民军之间的根本差别。他对士兵们说：“人民，并且只有人民才是我国的不可战胜的力量，军队必须毫无保留地为他们服务。”他说：“我们领导人，军队和党的干部，都必须为人民服务。”
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆二十一日电　据这里的报纸今天报道，在坦桑尼亚东南部的姆特瓦拉省，最近有数千非洲人举行示威，支持政府驱逐两名英国殖民主义者出境。
    被驱逐的两个英国殖民主义者，一个是姆特瓦拉镇一家旅馆的经理博贝特，另一个是姆特瓦拉省曼甘巴学校的女“教师”。据报道，他们是因为违反坦桑尼亚政府的政策而被驱逐出境的。
    示威者高举谴责殖民主义者的标语牌。在示威时，当众焚毁了英国殖民主义者博贝特的模拟人像。当这个模拟人像烧成灰时，群众高呼口号，并跳起舞来。
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　坦桑尼亚报纸《民族主义者报》二十日发表评论，号召非洲人民对帝国主义在非洲的报刊特别提高警惕。评论强调指出，帝国主义的报纸是帝国主义用来对非洲国家进行颠覆的一种工具。
