The revolutionary rebels of Beijing Chemical Factory have seized power!

Beijing Chemical Factory has been reborn!

The revolutionary rebels are all jubilant, raising our hands high, celebrating the great victory of invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Celebrating the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line over the bourgeois reactionary line!

With the rebels seizing power, Beijing Chemical Factory is in chaos! In great chaos! Those who used to hide in the dark corners, silent and unspoken, have now burst out, shouting and screaming. They slander the revolutionary rebels, saying our seizure of power is "lawless," "power-hungry," "arbitrary," "ambitious," "too chaotic," and so on.

All of this is nonsense. In essence, these lies are meant to suppress the revolutionary rebels of Beijing Chemical Factory, forbidding them from rebelling! These lies are meant to protect a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. Only by refuting these various lies can we boost the morale of the proletarian revolutionary rebels and crush the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

You say the revolutionary rebels are "lawless"? Ordinary workshop workers have come to the offices to participate in and supervise production management. Isn't this "lawless"? Yes, we have Mao Zedong Thought as our powerful ideological weapon. We are indeed lawless. We fear neither heaven nor earth. We will not be the obedient sons and grandsons of bourgeois law or revisionist law. We will smash these laws and create a new world.

You say the revolutionary rebels are "power-hungry"? Yes, we want to seize power and seize benefits. Our minds are filled with thoughts of power! Power!!! Power!!! If we don't seize power, who will? If we don't seize benefits, who will? Can we let a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party seize power and benefits? Can we let those stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line seize power and benefits? No! Absolutely not! We remember Chairman Mao's teachings. We never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. We will seize power and benefits for the Party and for the proletariat.

You say the revolutionary rebels are "arbitrary"? We are indeed arbitrary. Today, if the power is not in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary rebels to be arbitrary, can it be in the hands of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party to be arbitrary? Can it be in the hands of those stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line to be arbitrary? No! Absolutely not! We must sweep away all obstacles on the revolutionary path. We must smash their counterattacks. We must seize the great power from their hands and firmly grasp it in the hands of the revolutionary rebels. We, the revolutionary rebels, will be arbitrary towards a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. We will be arbitrary towards those stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line!

You say the revolutionary rebels are "ambitious"? Indeed, we are ambitious, and our ambition is great. This ambition is: we want to smash the old world and create a new world, eliminate all harmful elements, and liberate all of humanity. We want to fight down, fight over, and fight against the handful of capitalist roaders within Beijing Chemical Factory, carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, and turn Beijing Chemical Factory into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. If we do not achieve this ambition, we will die with our eyes unclosed.

You say Beijing Chemical Factory is "too chaotic"? In fact, it is not "too chaotic," but rather not chaotic enough. For seventeen years, the revisionist rules and regulations, the strange old frameworks, those who boast "I am the Party," and those who suppress and retaliate against revolutionary masses have oppressed the revolutionary masses, making them dare not speak, dare not move, lifeless and cold. Can the revolutionary masses endure this oppression forever? Shouldn't this old world be smashed? Chairman Mao said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." To truly liberate the revolutionary masses of Beijing Chemical Factory, to thoroughly smash the old world of Beijing Chemical Factory, Beijing Chemical Factory must have revolutionary chaos, the more chaotic, the better. We celebrate revolutionary chaos!

Some opponents of seizing power shout in meetings and privately, "Firmly support the revolutionary seizure of power in Beijing Chemical Factory." Beware! These people are two-faced! They say one thing and mean another. When workers come to the offices to participate in production management, they are aggressive, making all sorts of unreasonable demands, even saying things like, "We will not be your slaves!" "This method is a new type of bourgeois reactionary line!" and so on.

This is also nonsense. In essence, they still want to suppress the revolutionary rebels and forbid them from rebelling. In the past, these opponents of seizing power worked hard for the capitalist roaders, obediently, respectfully, and without complaint, willingly becoming slaves to the capitalist roaders. Look now, the revolutionary rebels have seized power and taken the seal, these opponents of seizing power have stripped down and shouted, "We will not be your slaves," using all their strength to slander, calling the revolutionary rebels "slave owners" and the revolutionary seizure of power struggle a "new type of bourgeois reactionary line." Look, their intentions are so malicious. We revolutionaries must expose their true faces and must resolutely repel this evil trend.

After their various lies were refuted by the revolutionary masses, these opponents of seizing power played new tricks, trying to grab a lifeline. They put on a pitiful act towards the revolutionary rebel workers who came to the offices to participate in and supervise production management, saying things like, "Your method of seizing power is not trusting the masses," "not trusting that we can liberate ourselves," "is there no revolutionary faction here?" and so on. In essence, they still want to suppress the revolutionary rebels and forbid them from rebelling, only changing their methods. I ask those in the offices who manage the great production power of Beijing Chemical Factory: letting the workshop workers of Beijing Chemical Factory come to the offices and unite with the revolutionary rebels in the offices to participate in and supervise production management, is this method not trusting the masses? Not trusting that the masses can liberate themselves? Can workers not participate in production management? Tell you, using the method of mass supervision to manage production is a method of fully trusting that the masses can liberate themselves. Opponents of seizing power, do not even think about grabbing half a lifeline.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Moreover, the big snakes and small snakes, black snakes and white snakes, snakes that bare their fangs and snakes that turn into beautiful women, although they have felt the threat of winter, have not yet frozen stiff!" Today, the power of the capitalist roaders has been seized by us revolutionary rebels, but they are still alive, their hearts are not dead, they will struggle, even launch crazy counterattacks. We revolutionary rebels must be ten times, a hundred times more vigilant, prepare to face more serious struggles, and with Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, resolutely repel their counterattacks.

After seizing power in Beijing Chemical Factory, there are still quite a few people who, although they support seizing power, still have various doubts, many concerns, and layer upon layer of worries. In a word, their minds have not completely changed, they do not yet fully understand the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebels seizing power, and they lack the courage for workers to be masters. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must eliminate all cowardly and incompetent thoughts within ourselves. All views that overestimate the enemy's strength and underestimate the people's strength are wrong." We must establish firm confidence, firmly believe that the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses not only can seize power but also can hold power and hold it better.

The power struggle in Beijing Chemical Factory relies on Mao Zedong Thought and relies on the revolutionary masses. After seizing power, defending and consolidating the power still relies on Mao Zedong Thought and still relies on the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao has always taught us that the people have limitless creativity. The masses are the true heroes. We firmly believe that the revolutionary masses will definitely unswervingly support the revolutionary rebels seizing power and will even more unswervingly fight with the revolutionary rebels to defend and consolidate the seized power.

Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the working class unite! The working class unite with revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, to defend and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, to seize one victory after another, advance! Advance further!

　　夺权有理
　　北京化工厂革命造反总部
    北京化工厂的革命造反派夺权了！
    北京化工厂获得了新生！
    革命造反派无不欢欣鼓舞，我们高举双手，欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！欢呼无产阶级革命路线反对资产阶级反动路线的胜利！
    化工厂革命造反派夺了权，化工厂“乱”了！“大乱”了！过去厂内那些一直躲在阴暗角落里沉默不语的人，此时此刻，暴跳如雷，破门而出了。他们大叫大喊，大肆诬蔑革命造反派，说我们的夺权行动是什么
  “无法无天”呀，什么“争权夺利”呀，什么“独断专行”呀，什么“野心家”呀，什么“太乱了”呀，等等。
    这统统是谬论。说穿了，这些谬论就是要压制化工厂的革命造反派，不准造反！这些谬论就是要保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，保护坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。只有对这些形形色色的谬论痛加驳斥，才能大长无产阶级革命造反派的志气，大灭资产阶级的威风。
    你们不是说革命造反派“无法无天”吗？普通的车间工人居然来到了科室参加生产管理，监督生产管理，这不是“无法无天”了吗？是的，我们有毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器，我们就是无法无天，我们天不怕，地不怕，我们决不做资产阶级王法、修正主义王法的孝子贤孙，我们要砸烂这些王法，创立新世界。
    你们不是说革命造反派“争权夺利”吗？对！我们就是要争权，要夺利，我们满脑子想的就是权！权！！权！！！我们不争权谁争权？！我们不夺利谁夺利？！难道能让一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派争去权、夺去利吗？难道能让那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子争去权、夺去利吗？不能！绝对不能！我们牢记毛主席的教导，我们念念不忘无产阶级专政，我们要为党、为无产阶级去争权、去夺利。
    你们不是说革命造反派“独断专行”吗？我们就是要独断专行。在今天，政权不由无产阶级革命造反派“独断专行”，难道还能让一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派独断专行吗？难道能让那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子独断专行吗？不能！绝对不能！我们要扫除革命道路上的重重阻力，我们要粉碎他们的种种反扑，我们一定要从他们手里夺回大权，把厂内各种大权牢牢掌握在革命造反派手里。我们革命造反派对一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派就是要独断专行，对坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子就是要独断专行！
    你们不是说革命造反派是“野心家”吗？不错，我们就是“野心家”，而且“野心”很不小。这个“野心”就是：我们要打碎旧世界，创造新世界，扫除一切害人虫，解放全人类。我们要斗倒、斗垮、斗臭化工厂一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，把化工厂的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把化工厂办成一个毛泽东思想的大学校。不达“野心”，我们死不瞑目。
    你们不是说化工厂“太乱了”吗？其实，不是“太乱了”，而是乱得不够。十七年来，化工厂的修正主义的清规戒律，那些千奇百怪的旧框框，那些动不动
  “老子就是党”的狂妄者，那些打击报复革命群众的干将，把化工厂革命群众压得说不敢说，动不敢动，死气沉沉，冷冷清清。革命群众难道能长期忍受这种欺压吗？这样的旧世界难道不该砸烂吗？毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”要真正解放化工厂的革命群众，要彻底砸烂化工厂的旧世界，化工厂就必须有革命的大乱，越乱越好。我们欢呼革命的大乱！
    一些反对夺权者，在会上会下大喊“坚决支持化工厂革命夺权”。留神！这些家伙，是两面派！他们口是心非。当工人来到科室参加管理生产时，他们气势汹汹，百般刁难，提出种种无理要求，甚至说什么“我们决不当你们的奴隶”呀！“这样作法是新型的资产阶级反动路线”呀！等等。
    这还是谬论。说穿了，他们还是要压制革命造反派，不准造反。想从前，这些反对夺权者，为走资本主义道路的当权派卖力，服服贴贴，恭恭敬敬，毫无怨言，甘当走资本主义道路的当权派的奴隶。看如今，革命造反派夺了权，掌了印，这些反对夺权者，竟然赤膊上阵，大喊“我们决不当你们的奴隶”，竭尽诬蔑之能事，把革命造反派诬之为“奴隶主”，把革命造反派的夺权斗争诬之为“这是新型的资产阶级反动路线”，看，其用心何其毒。我们革命者必须戳穿其真面目，必须坚决击退这股妖风逆流。
    这些反对夺权者，在他们的种种谬论被革命群众痛加驳斥后，又耍新花招，想捞取一根救命稻草。他们对来到科室参加生产管理、监督生产管理的革命造反派工人，装出一副可怜相来，说什么“你们这样夺权作法是不相信群众”，“不相信我们部门自己能解放自己”，“难道我们这里一个革命派都没有吗？”等等奇谈怪论。说穿了，仍然是要压制革命造反派，不准造反，只不过换了一种手法罢了。请问管理整个化工厂生产大权的科室的某些人：让化工厂的车间工人到科室去，和科室的革命造反派联合起来，参加生产管理、监督生产管理，难道这样的作法是不相信群众吗？是不相信群众自己解放自己吗？难道工人就不能当家作主参加生产管理吗？告诉你们，采取群众监督的方法管理生产，就是充分相信群众能自己解放自己的方法。反对夺权者，休想从中捞取半根救命稻草。
    毛主席教导我们：“况且盘踞在大部分中国土地上的大蛇和小蛇，黑蛇和白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇，虽然它们已经感觉到冬天的威胁，但是还没有冻僵呢！”在今天，走资本主义道路当权派的权被我们革命造反派夺了，但是，他们人还在，心不死，他们还要挣扎，甚至疯狂反扑。我们革命造反派更须十倍、百倍警惕，准备迎接更严重的搏斗，以毛泽东思想为武器坚决打退他们的反扑。
    化工厂夺权后，还有相当一部分人，虽然拥护夺权，但是他们还有种种的怀疑，重重的顾虑，层层的担心，一句话，他们的脑子还没完全转过弯来，他们对革命造反派夺权的革命行动还不很理解，还缺少工人当家作主的勇气。毛主席教导我们：“我们应当在自己内部肃清一切软弱无能的思想。一切过高地估计敌人力量和过低地估计人民力量的观点，都是错误的。”我们必须树立坚定的信心，坚信革命造反派、革命群众不仅能夺权，而且还能掌权，掌的更好。
    化工厂的夺权斗争，依靠的就是毛泽东思想，依靠的就是革命群众。夺权后，保卫政权、巩固政权，依靠的仍然是毛泽东思想，仍然是革命群众。毛主席一直教导我们，人民群众有无限的创造力。群众是真正的英雄。我们坚信，革命群众一定能坚定不移地支持革命造反派夺权，更能坚定不移地与革命造反派一起为保卫和巩固夺得的政权而斗争。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，工人阶级联合起来！工人阶级同革命师生、革命知识分子、革命干部联合起来，为保卫和巩固无产阶级政权，为夺取一个又一个的胜利，前进！再前进！
