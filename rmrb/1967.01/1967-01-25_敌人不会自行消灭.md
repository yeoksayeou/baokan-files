The enemy will not disappear on its own. Chairman Mao said: "The enemy will not disappear on its own." The rule of imperialism and colonialism led by the United States, although overthrown in some independent African countries, still has its people and unyielding spirit. Like wounded beasts, they still eye their prey, ready to strike back at any moment to reclaim lost territory.

Six years ago, they did this in the Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Two years ago, they did this in Ghana. Today, they are still plotting to overthrow more African independent countries, dragging these countries back into the dark days of slavery.

This backlash determines that the anti-imperialist struggle of the African people will not easily achieve victory and will inevitably face setbacks.

This backlash determines that the African people must always be highly vigilant against the invasions of imperialism and colonialism, and must fight back with equal force, engaging in a head-on struggle.

This backlash also determines that the African people must purge imperialist agents from their ranks, root out every time bomb planted by imperialism, and thoroughly smash imperialist plots of subversion.

Chairman Mao said: "We must never, because of victory, relax our vigilance against the mad revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will disarm himself politically and put himself in a passive position."

This teaching is equally important for the African people who are fighting against imperialism and for national independence.

### 敌人不会自行消灭

　　敌人不会自行消灭
　　毛主席说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的”。以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的统治，在一些非洲独立国家里虽然被推翻了，但是他们人还在，心不死。他们像受了伤的野兽一样，仍然虎视眈眈地准备随时进行反扑，夺回失去了的地盘。
    六年前，他们在刚果（利）这样干过。两年前，他们在加纳也这样干过。今天，他们还阴谋颠覆更多的非洲独立国家，把这些国家重新拉回被奴役的黑暗年月。
    这种反扑，决定了非洲人民的反帝斗争不可能轻易获得胜利，免不了会有反复。
    这种反扑，决定了非洲人民对于帝国主义和殖民主义侵略必须随时保持高度警惕，以眼还眼，以牙还牙，同他们进行针锋相对的斗争。
    这种反扑，也决定了非洲人民必须肃清自己队伍里的帝国主义代理人，挖掉帝国主义埋下的每一颗定时炸弹，彻底粉碎帝国主义的颠覆阴谋。
    毛主席说：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”
    这个教导，对于为反对帝国主义、维护民族独立而斗争的非洲人民，同样是非常重要的。
