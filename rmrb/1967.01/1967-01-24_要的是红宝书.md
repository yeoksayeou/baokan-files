A French airline company's aircraft slid into Shanghai Hongqiao Airport's apron. As soon as the cabin door was opened, a member of the French airline crew hurriedly disembarked. He did not go to inspect the aircraft's mechanical equipment but instead gestured with his hands to the Chinese staff, saying an English word "red."

The Chinese staff did not understand his meaning, and he repeatedly gestured, saying "red," and also said: "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong." The Chinese staff understood his meaning and handed him a French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." This French friend jumped for joy, immediately solemnly opened the little red book and read a few passages, then carefully took the book onto the aircraft to keep.

The above is a translation of the article from the Chinese newspaper The People's Daily.

　　要的是红宝书
    一架法国航空公司飞机滑进上海虹桥机场停机坪以后，刚刚打开机舱门，一位法航机组人员就匆忙地跑下飞机。他不去检查飞机的机械设备，而是用手比划着对中国工作人员说一个英文字“红的”。
    中国工作人员不懂他的意思，他一再比划着说“红的”，并且说：“毛泽东，毛泽东”。中国工作人员明白了他的意思，把一本法文版的《毛主席语录》送给了他。这位法国朋友高兴得跳了起来，马上严肃地翻开红宝书读了几段，然后把《毛主席语录》爱护备至地拿到飞机上保存起来。
