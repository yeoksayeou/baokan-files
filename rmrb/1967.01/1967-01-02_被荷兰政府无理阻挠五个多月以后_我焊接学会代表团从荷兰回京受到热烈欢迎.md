After being unreasonably obstructed by the Dutch government for over five months, the delegation of the Chinese Welding Society, which attended the 19th annual meeting of the International Welding Society, returned to Beijing on January 1st under the leadership of the delegation head Pan Renxian. The eight-member delegation was warmly welcomed and comforted at the airport by Vice Minister and Vice Chairman of the First Ministry of Machine Building Shen Hong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, former Chinese Charge d'Affaires to the Netherlands Li Enqiu, representatives from relevant departments, and family members of the delegation in Beijing. Shen Hong delivered a welcome speech, praising the delegation for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, persistently studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and displaying an unyielding, arduous, and revolutionary spirit during their struggle. He warmly welcomed their victorious and safe return to the motherland and strongly condemned the Dutch authorities for their unreasonable obstruction of the delegation's return.

The Chinese Welding Society delegation departed for the Netherlands on July 4, 1966, to attend the 19th annual meeting of the International Welding Society. Due to the open connivance of the Dutch government, American spies conducted conspiratorial activities against the delegation member Xu Zicai, attempting to make him betray his country. Xu Zicai fell to his death while trying to jump from a building. The Dutch government not only distorted the facts and concealed the responsibility but also used this incident as an excuse to unreasonably declare the Chinese Charge d'Affaires to the Netherlands, Li Enqiu, as an "unwelcome person." They issued summonses to obstruct the delegation's departure from the Netherlands and attempted to conduct illegal interrogations. At the same time, the Dutch government dispatched police to surround and blockade the Chinese Charge d'Affaires' office, conducting unreasonable inspections and interrogations of the office staff and visitors. The Chinese government conducted serious negotiations and struggles against the Dutch government's unreasonable measures.

After more than five months of negotiations and struggles, the Dutch government was forced to abandon its demand for illegal interrogations and changed its previous rigid attitude. The delegation departed from the Netherlands on December 30, 1966, and returned to the country.

Before leaving the Netherlands, the delegation issued a written statement strongly condemning the Dutch government's handling of the Xu Zicai defection and death incident, which damaged the friendly relations between the peoples of China and the Netherlands. At the same time, they expressed gratitude to the Dutch friends who had shown concern and comfort to the delegation over the past five months.

    被荷兰政府无理阻挠五个多月以后
    我焊接学会代表团从荷兰回京受到热烈欢迎
    新华社一日讯　被荷兰政府长期无理阻挠回国的我国出席国际焊接学会十九届年会的中国焊接学会代表团，经过五个多月的斗争之后，在团长潘任宪率领下，一行八人于一月一日安全返抵北京。他们在机场受到了第一机械工业部副部长兼中国机械工程学会副理事长沈鸿、外交部副部长罗贵波、中国前驻荷兰代办李恩求以及有关机关代表和代表团成员的在京家属的热烈欢迎和慰问。沈鸿向代表团致欢迎词，对他们在斗争期间高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，发扬不屈不挠，艰苦奋斗的革命精神表示赞扬，热烈欢迎他们斗争胜利安全返回祖国，并对荷兰当局无理阻挠代表团回国的行为进行了谴责。
    我国焊接学会代表团是在一九六六年七月四日赴荷兰参加国际焊接学会第十九届年会的。由于荷兰政府的公然纵容，美国特务向我国代表团团员徐子才进行阴谋活动，策动他背叛祖国。徐子才在企图跳楼叛逃时，摔伤致死。荷兰政府不仅歪曲上述事实，掩饰罪责，而且以这个事件为借口，竟无理地宣布我国驻荷兰代办李恩求为所谓“不受欢迎的人”，并发出传票，阻挠代表团离荷返国，要对他们进行非法传讯。与此同时，荷兰政府派出警察对我国驻荷代办处进行包围封锁，并对我代办处人员和来客进行无理检查和盘问。对于荷兰政府上述的无理措施，我国政府进行了严正交涉和斗争。
    经过五个多月的交涉和斗争，荷兰政府被迫放弃了非法传讯的要求，改变了原来的僵硬态度。代表团在一九六六年十二月三十日离荷返国。
    代表团在离荷返国前，发表了书面声明，对于荷兰政府处理这次徐子才叛逃摔死事件的态度和措施损害了中荷两国人民友好关系，表示了强烈的谴责；同时，对五个多月来向代表团表示过关怀慰问的荷兰朋友们表示感谢。
