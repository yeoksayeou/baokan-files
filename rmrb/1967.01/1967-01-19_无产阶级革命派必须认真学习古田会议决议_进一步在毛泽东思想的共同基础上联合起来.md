The proletarian revolutionary factions must seriously study the Ancient Town Conference Resolution and further unite on the common basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Shanghai *Liberation Daily* and *Wenhui Daily* today both reprinted in red on the first page the resolution written by our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao in 1929: "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thought," along with the "Editor's Note" and "Message to Readers."

The "Editor's Note" in the *Liberation Daily* says: The current situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in the Shanghai area is excellent. Revolutionary workers, peasants, students, cadres, and other revolutionary masses have united under the banner of proletarian revolutionary rebellion. Great Mao Zedong Thought is the common foundation for the unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions. In the struggle to thoroughly defeat the bourgeois reactionary line, the proletarian revolutionary factions must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to seriously and diligently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, truly arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. In addition to studying the "Three Articles" as a motto, this newspaper today reprints Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thought." We hope comrades will study it seriously.

"On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thought" is the resolution written by our great leader Chairman Mao for the Ninth Party Representative Conference of the Fourth Red Army, known as the Ancient Town Conference Resolution. This resolution summarizes the rich experience of the party and the army in fighting against various erroneous thoughts within the Communist Party at that time. It is the guideline for building the party and the army. This resolution points out the manifestations, sources, and methods of rectifying various non-proletarian thoughts within the Fourth Army at that time, which still have great practical significance today. We hope that revolutionary comrades will link their thoughts with practical struggles, seriously study this brilliant work, further raise their ideological level, and make our ranks more united. Let us advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

The "Message to Readers" in the *Wenhui Daily* says: The resolution of the Ancient Town Conference written by our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao in 1929, "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thought," is an extremely great and important document. This document is the most important summary of our party's experience in building the party and the army since its founding. It is the product of the victory of proletarian thought over bourgeois thought and the victory of the proletarian line over the bourgeois line within our ranks. The publication of this document made the Red Army at that time completely based on Marxism-Leninism, eliminating all influences of the old-style army. Today, we reprint and restudy this brilliant work, which has extremely profound practical significance for guiding the current proletarian cultural revolution. While we are overthrowing the bourgeois, we must also overthrow the bourgeois thoughts in our minds. We hope that our revolutionary rebel comrades will seriously study this document and share your study experiences with us. Let us fight and study together, further unite and advance from victory to victory under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    无产阶级革命派必须认真学习古田会议决议
    进一步在毛泽东思想的共同基础上联合起来
    《解放日报》《文汇报》重登毛主席这篇光辉著作并发表“编者的话”和“告读者”
    新华社上海十八日电　上海《解放日报》、《文汇报》今天都在第一版套红重新刊登了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在一九二九年写的古田会议决议：《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，同时分别发表了“编者的话”和“告读者”。
    《解放日报》的“编者的话”说：当前，上海地区的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好。革命的工人、农民，革命的学生，革命的干部和其他革命群众，在无产阶级革命造反的大旗下联合起来了。伟大的毛泽东思想，是无产阶级革命派实现大联合的共同基础。无产阶级革命派在彻底打倒资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，必须坚决响应林彪同志的号召，认真地、刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作，使自己真正用毛泽东思想武装起来。除了要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学习以外，本报今天重新发表毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作，希望同志们认真学习。
    《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，是我们伟大领袖毛主席为红军第四军第九次党代表大会写的决议，即古田会议决议。这个决议总结了当时红军中的共产党和各种错误思想作斗争的丰富经验，是我党我军的建党建军纲领。这个决议指出了当时四军党内各种非无产阶级思想的表现、来源及其纠正的方法，在今天同样有着重大的现实意义。希望革命的同志，联系思想，联系斗争实践，认真地学习这篇光辉著作，进一步提高我们的思想水平，使我们的队伍进一步团结起来，沿着毛主席的革命路线勇猛前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    《文汇报》的“告读者”说：我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在一九二九年写的古田会议的决议：《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，是一篇极其伟大、极其重要的文献。这个文献是我们的党成立以来在建党建军方面经验的最重要的总结，是我们队伍里无产阶级思想对资产阶级思想、无产阶级路线对资产阶级路线斗争取得胜利的产物。这个文献的发表，使当时的红军完全建立在马克思列宁主义的基础上，肃清了一切旧式军队的影响。今天我们重新刊登，重新学习这篇光辉的著作，对指导当前这场无产阶级文化大革命运动，有极其深刻的现实意义。我们在革资产阶级的命的同时，也要革自己头脑里存在的资产阶级思想的命。希望革命造反派的战友们认真学好这篇文献，并把学习的体会告诉我们。让我们一边战斗，一边学习，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下进一步联合起来，团结起来，从胜利走向新的胜利！
