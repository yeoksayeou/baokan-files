This revolutionary rebel spirit is excellent!

Fan Shumin
Worker, Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Factory

I read the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" issued by eleven revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai with great excitement. Their revolutionary rebel spirit is excellent! I fully support it and am determined to learn from them.

The various tactics of the bourgeois reactionary line are like apprentices taught by the same master. The phenomena of the struggle between the two lines reflected by the Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels also exist in our factory. For example, when the revolutionary masses stood up to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, a small group of people who stubbornly carried out the bourgeois reactionary line set the tone, saying things like, "The key issue in the factory right now is the problem of technical equipment." They attempted to suppress the revolution with "production first." After their plot was exposed, they incited workers who were not clear about the truth to go on strike and petition, causing our factory's production to suffer losses. After the revolutionary masses stood up, these people retreated to the background, inciting some workers to continue opposing the rebel workers and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. All of this shows that the struggle between the two lines in our factory has become more intense.

We rebel workers deeply understand that the task of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" before us is still very arduous, and it is wrong to underestimate the harm caused by the bourgeois reactionary line; but we also clearly see that the situation of the struggle is excellent. Many workers who were temporarily deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line are awakening and are standing up for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We revolutionary rebel workers will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings of "resolving to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and in the struggle, transform and improve ourselves, unite the majority, thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end; and bravely shoulder the burden of production, to achieve double victories in the revolution and production.

    这种革命造反精神好得很！
    北京内燃机厂工人　范淑敏
    我怀着激动的心情读了上海市十一个革命群众组织《告上海全市人民书》。他们这种革命造反精神好得很！我一万个支持！并决心向他们学习。
    资产阶级反动路线的种种表现手法，就像一个师傅教出来的徒弟一样。上海工人革命造反派反映的两条路线斗争的现象，我们厂同样存在。例如，当革命群众起来批判资产阶级反动路线的时候，一小撮顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人却给定调子，说什么“当前厂内关键的关键是工艺装备问题。”企图以“抓生产”来压革命。当他们的阴谋被识破后，他们又挑动不明真相的职工罢工、请愿，使我厂生产受到损失。革命群众起来以后，这些人又退到幕后，策动一部分工人继续同造反派工人对抗，伺机进行反扑。所有这些，都说明我厂两条路线的斗争比以前更加激化了。
    我们造反派工人深深懂得，摆在我们面前的“抓革命，促生产”的任务，仍然是十分艰巨的，低估资产阶级反动路线造成的恶果也是错误的；但我们也清楚地看到斗争的形势是大好的。不少一时受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的工人，正在觉悟，纷纷站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。我们革命造反派职工一定遵循毛主席关于“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向，同时在斗争中改造自己，提高自己，团结大多数，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；并且勇敢地挑起生产的担子，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
