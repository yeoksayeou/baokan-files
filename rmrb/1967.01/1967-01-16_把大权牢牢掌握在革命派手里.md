The current phase of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has surged to a new high tide, with a favorable revolutionary situation. Workers, peasants, students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals have united. The revolutionary torrent is surging forward, and the bourgeois reactionary line is beginning to crumble. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and a small number of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, are retreating step by step and are surrounded by the revolutionary masses. The time to launch a total offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line has arrived.

However, the enemy will not voluntarily retreat from the stage of history. They have not resigned themselves to their failure and are still hiding in dark corners, stirring up trouble and making a last-ditch struggle.

As Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the U.S. imperialists' aggressive forces in China, they will not voluntarily retire from the stage of history."

"All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. As we all know, all reactionaries use the same method—brute force—to oppress the people. They are brutal, but not intelligent. We must unmask the reactionaries and all their offensive tactics and thus expose them, criticize them, repudiate them, and overthrow them."

The reality of the development of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution once again proves Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment.

Now, those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the small number of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, have used all the "treasures" in the arsenals of all exploiting classes in history to rule and suppress the masses. They use both soft and hard tactics, alternating between them, and resort to all means. When they begin to disintegrate politically, they launch a new economic attack on the proletariat. They are cunning and constantly come up with new tricks. One of their main tactics is to use revisionist economism to launch a new attack on us. They squander national property at will, arbitrarily increase wages and benefits, and issue various allowances indiscriminately. Some even secretly plot to incite the masses to fight each other, disrupt rail and road transportation, and incite some workers who do not understand the truth to stop working, thereby disrupting production. In essence, they want to shift the direction of the struggle, turning political issues into economic issues, and leading a life-and-death political struggle onto the wrong path of economism. They exert pressure on the proletarian revolutionary headquarters and the broad revolutionary masses, resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and use this to achieve the goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary masses must double their vigilance against the new counterattacks, new offensives, and new conspiracies of the bourgeois reactionary line and resolutely repel the enemy's attacks.

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. A handful of reactionaries are using material incentives and economic bribery to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks; they are disrupting social production, the national economy, and the socialist system of ownership. In a word, they want to undermine the foundations of the socialist economy, strangle the magnificent Cultural Revolution, protect themselves, and restore capitalism. The more they do this, the more they expose their counter-revolutionary revisionist ugly face, and also educate the broad revolutionary masses from the opposite side. We must not be complacent about this group of wolves in sheep's clothing. We must expose their conspiracies in a timely manner, politically defeat the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and seize power from the hands of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, firmly grasping it in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Otherwise, we cannot solve the problem from the root, let alone solve all the unreasonable systems in wages and benefits, and will allow a handful of those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a small number of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line to evade the deep exposure and criticism of the revolutionary masses. This will leave the roots of revisionism, which will inevitably stir up trouble and stage a comeback in the future, and our country will change color.

At the same time, we must see that our country is still "poor and blank"; while the issue of wages and benefits is widespread and very complex, some problems cannot be solved immediately. We should follow Chairman Mao's teaching to "grasp revolution, promote production," carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, do a good job in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and do a good job in production, and gradually solve these problems in the practical struggle of the three great revolutionary movements.

The great leader Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast to the whole country the "Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" from various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai, which is an event of great historical significance. This is a resolute blow to the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and is Chairman Mao's strongest support for the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and throughout the country. We, the proletarian revolutionary rebels, must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, unite with more revolutionary masses, and resolutely smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    把大权牢牢掌握在革命派手里
    醒尘
    当前，我国的无产阶级文化大革命又掀起了一个新高潮，革命形势大好。广大的工人、农民、学生、革命干部和革命知识分子联合起来了。革命的洪流正在奔腾前进，资产阶级反动路线开始全线崩溃。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子节节败退，陷入革命群众的重重包围之中。对资产阶级反动路线展开总攻击的时刻到了。
    但是，敌人是决不会自动退出历史舞台的。他们并没有甘心于自己的失败，仍然躲在阴暗的角落里煽阴风，掀黑浪，进行负隅顽抗，垂死挣扎。
    正如毛主席教导我们的：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”
    “凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”
    我国无产阶级文化大革命发展的现实，再一次证明了毛主席的这个英明论断。
    现在，那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，动用了历史上一切剥削阶级武库中统治和镇压人民群众的“法宝”，软硬兼施，交替使用，无所不用其极。当他们在政治上开始瓦解的时候，又从经济上向无产阶级发动了新的进攻。他们诡计多端，花样翻新。其中主要手段之一，就是用修正主义的经济主义向我们进行新的进攻。他们肆意挥霍国家的财产，任意增加工资、福利，滥发各种补助费。更有甚者，他们还暗地策划挑起群众斗群众，中断铁路、公路的交通运输，煽动部分不明真相的工人停工，破坏生产。戳穿来看，无非就是要转移斗争的大方向，把政治问题化为经济问题，把一场你死我活的严肃的政治斗争引导到经济主义的邪路上去，对无产阶级革命司令部，对广大革命群众施加压力，对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，借此达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的。对于资产阶级反动路线的新反扑、新进攻、新阴谋，革命的群众必须加倍提高革命警惕，坚决把敌人的进攻打下去。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权，就有了一切，没有政权，就丧失一切。一小撮反动的家伙，大搞什么物质刺激，采用经济收买的办法，腐蚀群众的革命意志，瓦解革命队伍；破坏社会生产，破坏国民经济，破坏社会主义所有制。一句话，就是要挖社会主义经济的墙脚，扼杀轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动，以保护自己，复辟资本主义。他们越是这样搞，就越发暴露了他们反革命修正主义的丑恶面目，也从反面教育了广大的革命群众。对于这群披着羊皮的狼，万万不能麻痹大意。我们必须及时戳穿他们的阴谋，从政治上打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把政权从走资本主义道路当权派的手中夺过来，牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派的手里。不然，就不能从根本上解决问题，更谈不上解决工资、福利中的一切不合理的制度，反而会使一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，逃避革命群众的深入揭发和批判，这样就会留下修正主义的祸根，将来还势必要兴风作浪，卷土重来，我们的国家就要改变颜色。
    同时，我们必须看到，我们的国家还是“一穷二白”的；而工资福利问题涉及面很广，也非常复杂，有些问题现在还不能立刻解决。我们应当按照毛主席的教导“抓革命，促生产”，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，把无产阶级文化大革命搞好，把生产搞好，在三大革命的斗争实践中逐步地解决这些问题。
    伟大的领袖毛主席亲自决定向全国广播上海各革命群众组织的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，是一个具有重大历史意义的事件。这是对资产阶级反动路线新反扑的迎头痛击，是毛主席对上海和全国革命造反派的最有力的支持。我们无产阶级革命造反派，一定要高高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，牢牢把握斗争的大方向，团结更广大的革命群众，坚决粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
