French revolutionary youth have announced the establishment of the French Communist Youth League (Marxist-Leninist).

They held a founding congress for the league in mid-December last year. The congress condemned modern revisionism, criticized the revisionist leaders of the French Communist Party and the leaders of the French Communist Student Union controlled by them, pointing out that they have betrayed Marxism-Leninism and the working people. The congress also declared firm support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The congress elected the league's leading body and decided to publish the periodical *Red Guards* (monthly) and the *Handbook of Marxist-Leninists*.

A large number of members and cadres of the French Communist Student Union have withdrawn from the union in batches and collectively to join the French Communist Youth League (Marxist-Leninist). In the Paris region, from the end of November last year to the beginning of December, in less than two weeks, about 450 people withdrew from the French Communist Student Union, which is almost all the members or almost all the active members of the union in the Paris region.

In the northern French city of Nancy, a large number of members of the French Communist Student Union also withdrew from the union.

    新华社巴黎四日电　法国革命青年宣布成立法国共产主义青年联盟（马克思列宁主义）。
    他们在去年十二月中旬举行了成立联盟的代表大会。会上谴责现代修正主义，谴责法国共产党修正主义领导人和他们所控制的法国共产主义学生联盟领导人，指出他们已经叛变了马克思列宁主义和劳动人民。代表大会还宣布坚决支持越南人民抗美救国斗争和中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    代表大会选出了联盟的领导机构，并且决定出版刊物《红卫兵》（月刊）和《马克思列宁主义者手册》。
    法国共产主义学生联盟的大批盟员和干部，成批地、集体地退出这个联盟，而参加了法国共产主义青年联盟（马克思列宁主义）。在巴黎地区，从去年十一月底到十二月上旬，不到两个星期，退出法国共产主义学生联盟的约有四百五十人，即这个联盟在巴黎地区的绝大多数盟员或几乎全部活动分子都已经退出联盟。
    在法国北部城市南锡，也有大批法国共产主义学生联盟盟员退出联盟。
