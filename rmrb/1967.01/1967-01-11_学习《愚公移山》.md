The editorial board of the *Liberation Army Daily* comments: Chairman Mao's brilliant work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," along with "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People," is a classic document of great communist education. It is a fundamental course that every revolutionary must take to establish a proletarian worldview. It is a powerful ideological weapon for smashing the bourgeois reactionary line and defending the proletarian revolutionary line. Over the past twenty years, the great thoughts in this brilliant work have played an immeasurably great role in changing the spiritual face of the people, nurturing new communist people, uniting the broad masses of the people, realizing the Party's correct line, and advancing the people's revolutionary cause.

Comrade Lin Biao has instructed us: "The 'Three Articles' should not only be studied by soldiers but also by cadres. The 'Three Articles' are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly practice them. We should study the 'Three Articles' as our guiding principles. Everyone at every level should study them. After studying, we must use them to carry out ideological revolution. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, study and apply the 'Three Articles' thoroughly, use the 'Three Articles' as our weapon, and carry out a revolution in our souls.

In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved great victories. However, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, do not accept their defeat. They are still playing new tricks and adopting new forms to deceive the masses, continuing to resist the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Every revolutionary fighter must seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant work, use the brilliant ideas in this work to arm our minds, stand firmly on the correct side, distinguish the right direction, and in all work, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, respect the masses' initiative, and always stand with the masses. We must resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, further criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and unshakably carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

To help comrades in the units study this great work, we have rewritten the guidance materials for reference.

"The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" is a brilliant work written by Chairman Mao on June 11, 1945, at the closing of the Seventh National Congress of the Party.

At that time, the international anti-fascist war had achieved decisive victories. Japanese imperialism was about to be defeated. However, on the path forward for the Party and the people, there were still serious struggles. As Chairman Mao pointed out, there were still two big mountains on the heads of the Chinese people—imperialism and feudalism. Japanese imperialism had not yet been completely defeated. American imperialism was actively pursuing a policy of supporting the Kuomintang and opposing communism, attempting to turn China into its colony after the victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance. The Kuomintang reactionaries, with the strong support of American imperialism, were preparing for civil war, attempting to eliminate the revolutionary forces of the people and seize the fruits of the people's war of resistance, leading China into darkness.

Therefore, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, China still faced two roads and two futures: one was for imperialism, especially American imperialism, to continue occupying China, making China return to the old semi-colonial, semi-feudal path; the other was, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to mobilize the masses, strengthen the people's forces, thoroughly overthrow the rule of imperialism and feudalism in China, and establish a new democratic China.

At this critical historical juncture, our Party held the Seventh National Congress. Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the Congress decided on the Party's line, adopted a new Party Constitution, and elected the Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. The Congress decided that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the Party's work. To mobilize the entire Party and the nation to implement the political line formulated by the "Seventh Congress," to thoroughly defeat the domestic and foreign reactionaries, and to strive for the victory of the national democratic revolution, Chairman Mao delivered the closing speech at the Congress, which is the brilliant work "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains."

"The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," along with "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," is a classic document of great communist education. It is our fundamental course for establishing a communist worldview. Over the past twenty years, the great thoughts in this brilliant work have educated and inspired the broad cadres and masses of our country. For the victory of the people's revolutionary cause and the implementation of the Party's line, they have dared to face all difficulties and all enemies, daring to climb mountains of knives and walk through fires, advancing bravely on the revolutionary path. The resounding call proposed by Chairman Mao in this work, "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," has become a household phrase in our country, becoming the guideline for the thoughts and actions of our revolutionary people, and the style of our era.

In the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved great victories, and the bourgeois reactionary line has been declared a failure. However, the struggle is still sharp and complex. The question of standing on what side, taking what attitude, and implementing what line is a severe test for every revolutionary. We must seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant work, use the brilliant ideas in this work to arm our minds, stand firmly on the correct side, distinguish the right direction, with "dare" as the key, overcome all difficulties, smash all obstacles, resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The following points should be emphasized in studying this great work at present:

1. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the unified action guideline for the entire Party, the entire army, and the nation, and is the fundamental guarantee for winning the revolution.

In this article, Chairman Mao pointed out: The first task of the Seventh National Congress of the Party was to decide on the Party's line. The future task is to lead the entire Party to implement the Party's line, that is, to propagate the line of the Congress and, through all comrades of the Party, widely explain it to the people, so that the entire Party and the nation have the confidence that the revolution must win, and struggle to implement the Party's line. When we study this brilliant work, we must first deeply understand the great significance of the Party's line for the revolutionary cause and deeply realize the extreme importance of propagating, defending, and resolutely implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The line issue is the primary issue of the Party's leadership. The Party's line is the unified action guideline for the entire Party, the entire army, and the nation, and is the basis for all the Party's policies and strategies. It determines the fate of the Party and the success or failure of the revolution. The leadership of the Party, in the final analysis, is to formulate the correct line based on actual conditions and use the Party's line to mobilize and arm the entire Party and the broad masses of the people. Chairman Mao said: "A political party must lead the revolution to victory by relying on the correctness of its political line and the consolidation of its organization." (Contradiction) Without the Party's line, the Party's leadership cannot be realized, and the Party's unity cannot be consolidated. The line issue is also the central issue of the Party's internal struggle. The Party's internal struggle, in the final analysis, is a struggle over which line to implement. If the correct line is not implemented, the wrong line will be implemented, and in the revolution, there has never been a case where a revolutionary party went astray and the revolution did not fail. Our revolution must avoid going astray and must succeed, so we must oppose the wrong line and implement the correct line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our Party has formulated the general line and general policy for the Chinese revolution and also formulated various specific work lines and specific policies. However, many comrades often remember the specific and individual work lines and policies of our Party but forget the general line and general policy of our Party. If we truly forget the general line and general policy of our Party, we will be blind, incomplete, and unclear revolutionaries. In executing specific work lines and specific policies, we will lose our way, waver, and delay our work." (Speech at the Jin-Sui Cadres Conference) Any specific work line and policy of the Party are subordinate to and connected with the general line and general policy of the Party. Forgetting the general line and general policy of the Party is forgetting the whole, forgetting the overall situation, forgetting the direction, forgetting the guiding principle, and being confused. Only by correctly understanding and mastering the general line and general policy of the Party can we correctly execute the specific work lines and specific policies of the Party and become conscious, complete, and clear revolutionaries.

Since its founding, our Party has had a correct proletarian line, that is, the Marxism-Leninism line represented by Chairman Mao. This red line runs through the entire history of our Party and army. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all the work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation. All the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese revolution led by our Party are the result of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian line. In the period of democratic revolution, Chairman Mao formulated the correct general line for our Party's democratic revolution and also formulated various specific work lines and policies for implementing this general line, thus guiding the ship of our revolution to navigate through countless shoals and reefs, advancing victoriously along the revolutionary path of Marxism-Leninism in the face of great winds and waves. After the victory of the democratic revolution, Chairman Mao also correctly formulated the general line and various specific work lines and policies for the socialist revolution and socialist construction, pointing the way forward for the entire Party and the nation, and leading us to achieve brilliant victories on all fronts. At present, our country is carrying out a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that touches the soul. In this great revolutionary movement, Chairman Mao timely summarized the new experiences of the mass movement, personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Articles," and led this great revolution along the correct line of Chairman Mao, achieving great victories. In the international proletarian revolutionary movement, Chairman Mao thoroughly criticized the traitorous and scab lines of modern revisionism, proposed the most correct and complete general line for the international communist movement and a set of strategies and tactics. Under the guidance of this revolutionary line, the international proletarian revolutionary movement, especially the revolutionary movement of oppressed nations against colonialism and for national liberation, has flourished and achieved one great victory after another. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will certainly lead the revolutionary people of the world to defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries and achieve the ultimate victory of the world revolution.

History tells us that the correct line is not naturally and peacefully produced and developed, but is produced and developed through struggle. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is precisely enriched, developed, and victorious in the struggle against the right and "left" opportunist lines. Chairman Mao said: "The opposition and struggle between different thoughts within the Party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions and the contradictions between new and old things in society within the Party. If there are no contradictions and ideological struggles to resolve contradictions within the Party, the life of the Party will also stop." (Contradiction) As long as class contradictions and class struggles exist in society, they will inevitably be reflected within our Party. The struggle between the two lines within the Party is the reflection of class struggles in society and is not subject to human will. This struggle existed in the past, exists now, and will continue to exist until classes are eliminated. Various opportunists and representatives of the bourgeois reactionary line will always stubbornly resist and interfere with Chairman Mao's correct line. To implement Chairman Mao's correct line, we must thoroughly criticize and smash all bourgeois reactionary lines.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being carried out in our country also involves the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line. At present, this struggle is still sharp and complex. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, do not accept their defeat. They are still playing new tricks and adopting new forms to deceive the masses, continuing to resist the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Unless we thoroughly defeat the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line, Chairman Mao's correct line cannot be implemented, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot achieve victory. Therefore, every comrade must stand firmly on the correct side, heighten vigilance, distinguish right from wrong, actively study, loyally implement, enthusiastically propagate, and bravely defend Chairman Mao's correct line. With the confidence of victory and the courage to overcome all difficulties, we must resolutely criticize and smash the bourgeois reactionary line, achieve new victories, and complete the great historical tasks entrusted to us by the Party and Chairman Mao.

2. Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." This sentence most concisely and comprehensively reflects the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat daring to struggle and daring to win, pointing out the most fundamental attitude and stance of the proletarian revolutionaries towards the Party and the people's cause and towards the difficulties and obstacles on the revolutionary path. This is the guiding principle that every revolutionary fighter must follow to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Revolution necessarily involves difficulties. What are difficulties? Difficulties are unresolved contradictions and problems. Such contradictions and problems are universal, always present, everywhere, and affecting everyone. The history of the Chinese revolution is a history of overcoming countless difficulties; the process of revolution is a process of constantly struggling against difficulties. "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties." (On the Negotiations in Chongqing) Work will always encounter difficulties. If there were no difficulties, we would not need to revolutionize, work, or struggle. Without difficulties and struggles, things cannot move forward. In the face of numerous obstacles and difficulties, what attitude should we take? Should we be fearless and daring to struggle, stepping over difficulties to move forward, or should we hesitate, be timid, and retreat in the face of difficulties? This is the dividing line between true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries, and it is the decisive key to whether we can successfully implement the Party's line and policies.

Chairman Mao said: "Both the reactionary forces and we face difficulties. However, the difficulties of the reactionary forces are insurmountable because they are forces approaching death with no future. Our difficulties are surmountable because we are new forces with a bright future." (Welcome the New High Tide of the Chinese Revolution) The proletariat is the most revolutionary and advanced class in human history. The proletarian revolutionary cause is a great cause that conforms to the laws of social development, conforms to the vital interests of the broad masses, and is wholeheartedly supported by the broad masses. Our difficulties are all temporary and completely surmountable difficulties encountered in the process of advancement. Under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao, our army can defeat the well-armed enemy with inferior equipment, the workers of Daqing can overcome extreme hardships to develop a large oil field, and the people of Dazhai can turn a poor valley into a high-yield field. These all powerfully prove that in the face of revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, there are no enemies that cannot be defeated, no difficulties that cannot be overcome, and no peaks that cannot be climbed. Chairman Mao said: "Our comrades must see achievements and see light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." (Serve the People) This is the reason.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." In the final analysis, this emphasizes the human factor and requires us to fully exert our subjective initiative, not fearing hardship or difficulty, daring to struggle and daring to win. Only by making up our minds and not fearing sacrifice can we overcome all difficulties, strive for victory, and overcome all enemies and difficulties. The people of Dazhai said well, "Difficulties are like bullies, if you retreat one step, they will advance ten steps; if you step over difficulties, they will obediently lie on the ground." The brave warriors of the 32111 drilling team, in the face of a sudden gas well explosion and the imminent destruction of the entire gas field, fearlessly and selflessly fought against the raging fire, extinguishing the blazing inferno in thirty minutes and protecting the state's property and the people's interests. The comrades of the "Red Front Radar Station" live on an island with an area of only 0.03 square kilometers, "the door is the sea, the path is the mountain, cliffs and steep slopes are everywhere dangerous, going up and down the mountain is everywhere difficult." To build the island well, they stubbornly brought soil from the mainland to the island, creating large and small eighty-three plots of vegetable fields in the rock crevices, making them grow vegetables. Navy soldier Mai Xiande, despite being seriously injured, stood up like an iron man, endured for three hours, and fought until the final victory. This is because they learned and mastered the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, possessing an indomitable spirit. On the contrary, if one fears difficulties, nothing can be accomplished, and any difficulty cannot be overcome. "Only heroes drive tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves." Difficulties can only intimidate the weak-willed, but in the face of fearless revolutionary fighters, mountains must bow their heads, and rivers must yield, all difficulties will be trampled underfoot.

The sentence "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" also tells us that we must acknowledge difficulties, analyze difficulties, and resolutely struggle against difficulties; we must both strategically despise difficulties and tactically respect difficulties; we must both dare to struggle and dare to win, and also be good at struggling and winning. Only in this way can we turn the possibility of overcoming difficulties into reality.

In tactics, respecting difficulties means taking a cautious attitude towards every specific struggle, emphasizing the art of struggle, deeply and meticulously understanding the nature, characteristics, and laws of each specific difficulty, and adopting different solutions for various difficulties. We must avoid blind and reckless actions that are detached from reality; at the same time, we must have the spirit of "digging the mountain every day without stopping," and in the process of working, continuously summarize experiences and lessons, and improve work methods. The workers of Daqing were able to overcome numerous difficulties because they followed Chairman Mao's teachings, conducted in-depth investigations and scientific analyses of objective difficulties, and concentrated their efforts to solve every specific difficulty they encountered. "Battles can only be fought one by one, and enemies can only be eliminated one by one." The people of Dazhai turned a poor valley into a high-yield field, doing so with one hammer, one shovel, one basket of soil, and one stone at a time. Everything is like this: if you don't dare to do it, you won't be able to do it; if you don't dare to do it well, you won't be able to do it. The psychology of relying on unexpected convenience and hoping for victory by chance must be completely eliminated.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "For our army, the best weapon is not the airplane, not the cannon, not the tank, not the atomic bomb. The best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought. The greatest fighting force is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, who are brave and fearless of death." Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and sharpest ideological weapon for overcoming all difficulties. With Mao Zedong Thought, one will have a fearless revolutionary spirit, become the most revolutionary, bravest, and wisest person, and be able to endure hardship, fear death, fear ghosts, fear demons, remain firm and fearless. The great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength for the entire Party, the entire army, and the nation to advance fearlessly, overcome all difficulties, defeat the enemy, and strive for victory. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, transform our souls, and become a truly selfless and fearless communist fighter.

3. Believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and struggle to implement Chairman Mao's correct line.

Chairman Mao teaches us that propagating the Party's line is to make the entire Party and the nation establish a belief that the revolution must win. First, we must make the vanguard aware, but this is not enough; we must also make the broad masses of the people throughout the nation aware and willingly struggle with us to win victory. It is precisely following Chairman Mao's teachings that we defeated the Japanese invaders, overthrew the two big mountains—imperialism and feudalism—on the heads of the Chinese people, and achieved great victories in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution and construction.

Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and closely linking with the masses are distinctive features of our Party that distinguish it from any other party, and are Chairman Mao's consistent great thoughts. Chairman Mao said: "The people, and only the people, are the creators of world history." This is the most concise and essential language of Marxist historical materialism. "As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe in the boundless creative power of the masses, and trust the people and blend with them, then any difficulty can be overcome, and any enemy cannot press us down, but will be pressed down by us." (On the Coalition Government) All the work and struggles of our Party are guided by this great teaching of Chairman Mao. The history of our Party is the history of relying on and mobilizing the masses to carry out revolutionary struggles, and the history of trusting and leading the masses to liberate themselves. Without the masses, we will become a tree without roots and a river without a source, the Party's line cannot be implemented, difficulties in work cannot be overcome, the revolution cannot be victorious, and we will achieve nothing.

In the history of our Party, the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the "left" and right opportunist lines has always revolved around the issue of the masses. What attitude should be taken towards the masses and the revolutionary mass movement—is it "dare" or "fear"? Is it believing in the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and respecting the masses' initiative, or is it fearing the masses, opposing the masses, and opposing and suppressing the revolutionary mass movement? This has always been the touchstone for distinguishing true revolutionaries from false revolutionaries, Marxists from revisionists, and the proletarian revolutionary line from the bourgeois reactionary line.

Our great leader Chairman Mao always believes in the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the masses' revolutionary movement the most, and is heart to heart with the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is the line of believing in the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and letting the masses educate and liberate themselves, which is "to recruit a large number of people to surround and annihilate the enemy." (On Opposing Japanese Imperialism) The proletarian cultural revolution line personally formulated by Chairman Mao is the most vivid embodiment of the mass line and a great creative development. All representatives of the bourgeois reactionary line are detached from the masses and fear the masses. Their line is the line of closism, the line of lone wolves, and the line of "fear." They have a thousand fears and ten thousand fears, which can be summed up in one sentence: fear the masses, fear the revolution. They completely fail to see the power of the masses, do not believe in the great creative power of the masses, treat the masses as a puppet, and treat themselves as a wise man. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the representatives of the bourgeois reactionary line attempted to lead the proletarian cultural revolution in the opposite direction, turning it into a struggle of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat rather than the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. They stood on the reactionary bourgeois stance, implemented bourgeois dictatorship, and attempted to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the masses, suppressing the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement. If their plots succeeded, the cultural revolution would be aborted, and the achievements of the socialist revolution would be in danger of being lost. However, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary masses were mobilized and united, and their plots could not succeed. They would inevitably be abandoned by the masses.

Every revolutionary comrade must also face the question of how to treat the masses and implement what line in their work. Is it to regard oneself as superior to others, or to be a humble student of the masses? Is it to stand above the masses or among the masses? Towards the revolutionary mass movement, is it support or opposition? This is a question that everyone encounters every moment and must clearly answer. This question is not a general work method issue but a fundamental attitude issue, a worldview issue. There are two worldviews and methodologies: the proletarian worldview and methodology and the bourgeois worldview and methodology. If your worldview is bourgeois, you will inevitably fear the masses and oppose the masses; if your worldview is proletarian, you will inevitably believe in the masses and rely on the masses. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some people fail to see the mainstream of the mass movement, often only seeing the tributaries, paying attention only to the individual and temporary shortcomings in the mass movement, and failing to see that the broad masses can learn to swim in swimming and learn to revolutionize in revolution. This is because they forget Chairman Mao's teaching: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable," only believing in their own superiority and not believing in the superiority of the masses, always holding the bourgeois worldview and methodology in their hands, and the proletarian worldview and methodology in their minds. Consequently, they cannot correctly treat the revolutionary mass movement. In work, some people feel helpless and retreat when encountering difficulties, lack confidence, and are timid. This is also a manifestation of the bourgeois worldview. Because they do not have the masses in their minds and do not see the wisdom and power of the masses, they naturally do not know how to find solutions among the masses. Therefore, we must actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use the "Three Articles" and the resolutions of the Gutian Conference as our weapons, resolutely break private interests and establish public interests, thoroughly transform our worldview, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must insist on believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and standing with the masses in all work, thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    学习《愚公移山》
    《解放军报》编者按：毛主席的《愚公移山》这篇光辉著作，同《纪念白求恩》、《为人民服务》一样，是伟大的共产主义教育的经典文献，是每个革命者树立无产阶级世界观的最根本的必修课，是粉碎资产阶级反动路线、保卫无产阶级革命路线的强大的思想武器。二十多年来，这篇光辉著作的伟大思想，对于改变人民的精神面貌，哺育共产主义新人，团结广大人民，实现党的正确路线，推进人民革命事业，发生了不可估量的伟大作用。
    林彪同志指示我们：“老三篇”不但战士要学，干部也要学。“老三篇”最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。哪一级都要学。学了就要用，搞好思想革命化。我们要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，狠学狠用“老三篇”，以“老三篇”为武器，在灵魂深处闹革命。
    在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了伟大的胜利。但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，并不甘心他们的失败。他们还在玩弄新的花样，采取新的形式来欺骗群众，继续对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。我们每一个革命战士，要认真学习毛主席这篇光辉著作，用这篇著作的光辉思想武装自己的头脑，站稳立场，明辨方向，坚持在一切工作中相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，永远和群众站在一起，坚决贯彻和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更加深入地批判资产阶级反动路线，坚定不移地把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    为了帮助连队的同志们学好这篇伟大著作，我们重新编写了辅导材料，供学习参考。
    《愚公移山》这篇光辉著作，是一九四五年六月十一日毛主席在党的第七次全国代表大会上的闭幕词。
    当时，国际反法西斯战争已经取得决定性的胜利。日本帝国主义即将被打败。但是，在党和人民的前进道路上，还存在着严重的斗争。正如毛主席指出
  的，在中国人民头上还有两座大山——帝国主义和封建主义。日本帝国主义还没有最后被打倒。美帝国主义正在积极推行扶蒋反共的政策，妄图在中国人民抗战胜利之后，把中国变为它的殖民地。国民党反动派在美帝国主义的大力扶持下，正在加紧准备内战，企图消灭人民革命力量，抢夺人民抗战的胜利果实，把中国引向黑暗。
    因此，在抗日战争胜利之后，中国仍然存在两条道路，两个前途：一是帝国主义、特别是美帝国主义继续霸占中国，使中国回到半殖民地半封建的老路；一是在中国共产党的领导下，放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，彻底推翻帝国主义和封建主义在中国的统治，建立一个人民民主的新中国。
    在这个重要的历史转变关头，我们党召开了第七次全国代表大会。大会在毛主席的亲自主持下，决定了党的路线，通过了新的党章，选举了以毛主席为首的中央委员会。大会确定毛泽东思想是全党一切工作的指针。为了动员全党和全国人民贯彻党的“七大”制定的政治路线，彻底打败国内外反动派，争取民族民主革命的胜利，毛主席向大会作了闭幕词，就是《愚公移山》这篇光辉著作。
    《愚公移山》这篇光辉著作，同《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》一样，是伟大的共产主义教育的经典文献，是我们树立共产主义世界观的最根本的必修课。二十多年来，这篇光辉著作的伟大思想，教育和鼓舞着我国的广大干部和人民群众，为了人民革命事业的胜利，为了贯彻执行党的路线，不怕一切险阻，不怕任何敌人，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，在革命的大道上奋勇前进。毛主席在这篇著作中提出的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的响亮号召，在我国已经家喻户晓，成为我国革命人民的思想和行动的准则，成为我们时代的风格。
    在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了伟大胜利，资产阶级的反动路线宣告失败。但是，斗争还是很尖锐、很复杂的。站在什么立场，采取什么态度，执行什么路线，这对于我们每个革命者都是一个严峻的考验。我们必须认真学习毛主席这篇光辉著作，用这篇著作的光辉思想武装自己的头脑，站稳立场，明辨方向，“敢”字当头，排除万难，粉碎一切阻力，坚决执行和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    当前学习这篇伟大著作，要着重领会以下几个问题：
    一、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是全党全军全国人民的统一行动纲领，是争取革命胜利的根本保证
    毛主席在这篇文章中指出：党的第七次全国代表大会所做的第一件事，就是决定了党的路线。今后的任务就是领导全党实现党的路线，就是要宣传大会的路线，并经过全党同志向人民作广泛的解释，使全党和全国人民建立起革命一定要胜利的信心，为实现党的路线而斗争。我们学习这篇光辉著作，首先就要深刻理解党的路线对革命事业的重大意义，深刻认识宣传、保卫和坚决贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的极端重要性。
    路线问题，是党的领导的首要问题。党的路线，是统一全党全军全国人民的行动纲领，是党的一切政策和策略的根据。它决定着党的命运，决定着革命的成败。党的领导，归根结底，就是根据实际情况，制定正确的路线，并用党的路线去动员、武装全党和全国广大人民群众。毛主席说：“一个政党要引导革命到胜利，必须依靠自己政治路线的正确和组织上的巩固。”（《矛盾论》）离开党的路线，就不能实现党的领导，巩固党的团结。路线问题，又是党内斗争的中心问题。党内斗争，归根结底，就是实行什么路线的斗争。不实行正确的路线，就要实行错误的路线，在革命中未有革命党领错了路而革命不失败的。我们的革命要有不领错路和一定成功的把握，就必须反对错误的路线，实行正确的路线。
    毛主席教导我们：“我党规定了中国革命的总路线和总政策，又规定了各项具体的工作路线和各项具体的政策。但是，许多同志往往记住了我党的具体的各别的工作路线和政策，忘记了我党的总路线和总政策。而如果真正忘记了我党的总路线和总政策，我们就将是一个盲目的不完全的不清醒的革命者，在我们执行具体工作路线和具体政策的时候，就会迷失方向，就会左右摇摆，就会贻误我们的工作。”（《在晋绥干部会议上的讲话》）党的任何一项具体的工作路线和政策，都是服从于、联结于党的总路线和总政策的，忘记了党的总路线和总政策，就是忘记了整体，忘记了全局，忘记了方向，忘记了挂帅的东西，就是糊涂人。只有正确地领会和掌握党的总路线和总政策，才能正确地执行党的具体工作路线和具体政策，才能成为一个自觉的完全的清醒的革命者。
    我们党从创立以来，就有一条正确的无产阶级路线，即以毛主席为代表的马克思列宁主义路线。这一条红线贯串着我们党和军队的整个历史。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。我们党领导的中国革命所取得的一切光辉胜利，都是由于贯彻执行了毛主席的无产阶级路线的结果。在民主革命时期，毛主席为我们党制定了正确的民主革命的总路线，并规定了为实现这一总路线的各项具体的工作路线和政策，从而引导我国革命的航船，绕过无数的险滩和暗礁，在大风大浪中，沿着马克思列宁主义的革命航道，胜利前进。民主革命胜利后，毛主席又正确地制定了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的总路线和各项具体的工作路线和政策，给全党和全国人民指明了前进的方向，引导我们在各条战线上不断取得了辉煌的胜利。当前，我国正在进行着一场触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命。在这一伟大的革命运动中，毛主席及时地总结了群众运动的新经验，亲自主持制定了“十六条”，使这场大革命沿着毛主席正确路线的轨道，不断前进，取得了巨大的胜利。在国际无产阶级革命运动中，毛主席彻底批判了现代修正主义的叛徒路线和工贼路线，提出了最正确、最完整的国际共产主义运动的总路线和一整套的战略和策略。在这一革命路线的指引下，国际无产阶级革命运动，特别是被压迫民族反对殖民主义、争取民族解放的革命运动蓬勃发展，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。毛主席的革命路线，必将引导世界革命人民战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派，取得世界革命的彻底胜利。
    历史告诉我们，正确的路线，不是自然地和平安地产生和发展起来的，而是从斗争中产生和发展起来的。毛主席的革命路线，就是在同右的和“左”的机会主义路线进行斗争中不断丰富，不断发展，不断取得胜利的。毛主席说：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”（《矛盾论》）只要社会上存在着阶级矛盾，阶级斗争，就必然会反映到我们党内来。党内两条路线的斗争，就是社会上的阶级斗争的反映，是不以人们的意志为转移的。这种斗争，过去有，现在有，一直到阶级消灭以前，还是会有。各种形形色色的机会主义者，资产阶级反动路线的代表人物，总是要顽强抵抗和干扰毛主席的正确路线的。我们要贯彻执行毛主席的正确路线，就必须彻底批判和粉碎一切资产阶级反动路线。
    我国正在进行着的无产阶级文化大革命，同样存在着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的斗争。目前，这种斗争还是很尖锐、很复杂的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，并不甘心自己的失败。他们还在玩弄新的花样，采取新的形式来欺骗群众，继续对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。不彻底打垮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，不彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，毛主席的正确路线就不能贯彻，无产阶级文化大革命就不能取得胜利。因此，我们每一个同志，一定要站稳立场，提高警惕，明辨是非，要积极学习、忠实执行、热情宣传、勇敢保卫毛主席的正确路线，以必胜的信心和排除万难的勇气，坚决批判和粉碎资产阶级反动路线，夺取新的胜利，完成党和毛主席交给我们的伟大的历史任务。
    二、下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利
    毛主席教导我们：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这段话，最集中最概括地反映了无产阶级敢于斗争、敢于胜利的无所畏惧的革命气概，指明了无产阶级革命者对待党和人民的事业，对待革命道路上困难和阻力的最根本的立场和态度。这是我们每个革命战士为实现毛主席的革命路线所必须遵循的行动指南。
    干革命必然有困难。什么叫困难？困难就是没有解决的矛盾和问题。这种矛盾和问题，是普遍存在的，时时有，处处有，人人有。中国革命的历史，就是一部战胜重重困难的历史；革命的过程，就是不断向困难作斗争的过程。“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。”（《关于重庆谈判》）工作总是会有困难的，没有困难，就不需要我们去革命、去工作、去斗争了。没有困难和斗争，事物就不能前进。在重重的阻力和困难面前，采取什么态度？是无所畏惧，敢于斗争，踩着困难向前进，还是瞻前顾后，畏首畏尾，在困难面前当逃兵，这是真革命和假革命的分界线，是能不能胜利地实现党的路线和政策的决定性关键。
    毛主席说：“反动势力面前和我们面前都有困难。但是反动势力的困难是不可能克服的，因为他们是接近于死亡的没有前途的势力。我们的困难是能够克服的，因为我们是新兴的有光明前途的势力。”（《迎接中国革命的新高潮》）无产阶级是人类历史上最革命、最先进的阶级。无产阶级革命事业，是符合社会发展规律、符合广大人民的切身利益、得到广大人民衷心拥护的伟大事业。我们的困难都是前进中的、暂时的、完全能够克服的困难。在毛主席的英明、正确领导下，我军能够以劣势的装备，打败武装到牙齿的敌人，大庆人能够在极端艰苦的条件下拿下大油田，大寨人能够把穷山沟变成高产田。这些，都有力地证明了：在毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士面前，没有打不倒的敌人，没有克服不了的困难，没有不可攀登的险峰。毛主席说：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”（《为人民服务》）就是这个道理。
    毛主席教导的：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，归根结底，就是强调人的因素，要我们充分发挥主观能动作用，不怕苦，不怕难，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。只有下定决心，不怕牺牲，才能排除万难，去争取胜利，才能压倒一切敌人，战胜一切困难。大寨人说得好，“困难是个欺软怕硬的东西，你退一尺，它就前进一丈；踩着困难前进，困难就得乖乖趴在地下。”32111钻井队的勇士们，在天然气井突然爆发、整个大气田面临着毁灭的危急关头，临危不惧，奋不顾身地同烈火搏斗，三十分钟就扑灭了冲天大火，保卫了国家的财产和人民的利益。“红色前哨雷达站”的同志们，住在面积只有零点零三平方公里的海岛上，“出门就是海，走路就爬山，悬崖峭壁处处险，上山下山处处难。”他们为了把海岛建设好，硬是从大陆上一把土、一把土地把土带到岛上，在岩缝间垫出了大大小小八十三块菜地，让它生长出蔬菜。海军战士麦贤得在头负重伤的情况下，仍然像铁人一样站得起，挺得住，坚持战斗三小时，直到最后胜利。这就是因为他们学习和掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，具有百折不挠的硬骨头精神。相反，如果害怕困难，那就什么事情也做不成，任何困难也不能克服。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”困难只能吓倒意志薄弱的软骨头，在天不怕、地不怕的革命战士面前，高山也得低头，河水也得让路，一切困难都将被我们踩在脚下。
    “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这段话还告诉我们，一定要承认困难，分析困难，扎扎实实地向困难作斗争；既要在战略上藐视困难，也要在战术上重视困难；既要敢于斗争，敢于胜利，也要善于斗争，善于胜利。只有这样，才能把克服困难的可能性变为现实性。
    在战术上重视困难，就是要在每一个具体斗争问题上，采取谨慎的态度，讲究斗争的艺术，深入细致地去摸清每一个具体困难的性质、特点和规律，并且针对着各种不同的困难，采取不同的解决办法，切忌脱离实际的盲目蛮干；同时，还要有“每天挖山不止”的埋头苦干精神，并且在干的过程中，不断总结经验教训，改进工作方法。大庆人能够攻下重重难关，是他们遵照毛主席的教导，对客观困难做了深入的调查研究和科学分析，集中全力解决遇到的每一个具体困难的结果。“打仗只能一仗一仗地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭。”大寨人把穷山沟变成高产田，就是这样一铁锤、一铁锹、一筐土、一块石地干起来的。任何事情都是这样：不怕做不到，就怕不去做；不怕做不好，就怕不用脑。一切不经过自己艰苦奋斗、流血流汗，而依靠意外便利、侥幸取胜的心理必须扫除干净。
    林彪同志说：“对我们军队来说，最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，最好的武器是毛泽东思想。最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是勇敢，不怕死。”毛泽东思想是战胜一切困难的最强大最锐利的思想武器。有了毛泽东思想，就会有无所畏惧的革命精神，就会成为最革命、最勇敢、最聪明的人，就能够不怕苦，不怕死，不怕鬼，不怕魅，坚贞不屈，无所畏惧。伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是全党全军和全国人民一往无前，排除万难，打败敌人，争取胜利的力量的源泉。我们一定要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，改造自己的灵魂，做一个真正大公无私、无所畏惧的共产主义战士。
    三、相信群众，依靠群众，为贯彻毛主席的正确路线而斗争
    毛主席教导我们，宣传党的路线，就是要使全党和全国人民建立起一个信心，即革命一定要胜利。首先要使先锋队觉悟，但这还不够，还必须使全国广大人民群众觉悟，甘心情愿和我们一起奋斗，去争取胜利。我们正是遵循着毛主席这一教导，打败了日本侵略者，推翻了压在中国人民头上的两座大山——帝国主义、封建主义，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命、社会主义建设的伟大胜利。
    相信群众，依靠群众，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起，是我们党区别于其他任何政党的一个显著的标志，是毛主席一贯的伟大思想。毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这是马克思主义的历史唯物论最概括最精华的语言。“只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”（《论联合政府》）我们党的一切工作和斗争，都是以毛主席这个伟大教导为指针的。我们党的历史，就是依靠和发动人民群众进行革命斗争的历史，就是信任和领导人民群众自己解放自己的历史。离开人民群众，我们就会成为无源之水，无本之木，党的路线就不能贯彻，工作中的困难就不能克服，革命就不能胜利，我们就将一事无成。
    在我们党的历史上，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和“左”右倾机会主义路线的斗争，一直围绕在群众的问题上。对待群众和革命的群众运动采取什么态度，是“敢”字当头，还是“怕”字当头；是相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，还是害怕群众，反对群众，反对和压制革命的群众运动，这历来是真革命和假革命、马克思主义和修正主义的试金石，是无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的分水岭。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，总是最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动，和革命群众心连心。毛主席的革命路线，就是相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的路线，是“要招收广大的人马，好把敌人包围而消灭之”（《论反对日本帝国主义的策略》）。毛主席亲自制定的无产阶级文化大革命的路线，是群众路线的最生动的体现，是一个伟大的创造性的发展。一切资产阶级反动路线的代表人物，都是脱离群众和害怕群众的。他们的路线，就是关门主义的路线，孤家寡人的路线，“怕”字当头的路线。他们有千怕万怕，一言以蔽之，就是：怕群众，怕革命。他们完全看不到群众的力量，不相信群众的伟大创造力，把群众当做阿斗，把自己当成诸葛亮。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，资产阶级反动路线的代表人物，企图把无产阶级文化革命引到相反的道路，变成不是无产阶级反对资产阶级，而是资产阶级反对无产阶级。他们站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，妄图扑灭群众的革命烈火，把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动打下去。如果他们的阴谋得逞，文化大革命就要夭折，社会主义革命的成果就有被葬送的危险。但是，在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，最广泛地把革命群众发动和团结起来，他们的阴谋就绝不能得逞，他们必然要被群众所抛弃。
    每个革命同志在自己的工作中，也都有个如何对待群众和执行什么路线的问题。是把自己看得高人一等，还是甘当群众的小学生？是站在群众之上，还是站在群众之中？对待革命的群众运动，是支持，还是反对？这是每个人每时每刻都会遇到的问题，都必须明确回答的问题。这个问题，不是一般工作方法问题，而是根本态度问题，是世界观的问题。有两种世界观、方法论：无产阶级的世界观、方法论和资产阶级的世界观、方法论。你的世界观是资产阶级的，你就必然害怕群众，反对群众；你的世界观是无产阶级的，你就必然相信群众，依靠群众。在无产阶级文化大革命中，有的人所以看不清群众运动的主流，常常只看支流，只注重群众运动中的个别的、暂时的缺点，看不到广大群众必能在游泳中学会游泳，在革命中学会革命，就是因为他忘记了毛主席的教导：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”，只相信自己高明，不相信群众高明，把资产阶级的世界观、方法论经常拿在手里；无产阶级的世界观、方法论却经常丢在脑后，因而不能正确地对待革命的群众运动。反映在工作上，有的人遇到困难的时候，所以感到束手无策，畏缩不前，信心不足，也是这种资产阶级世界观的表现。因为他思想上没有群众，看不见群众的智慧和力量，当然也就不知道到群众中去找办法。因此，我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”和古田会议决议为武器，坚决破私立公，彻底改造世界观，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线，坚持在一切工作中相信群众，依靠群众，和群众站在一起，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
