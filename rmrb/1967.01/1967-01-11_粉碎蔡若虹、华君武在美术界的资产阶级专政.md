	Editor's Note: The counter-revolutionary revisionists Cai Ruohong and Hua Junwu, who have long been hiding in the art world, have been exposed by the revolutionary masses. It is good that they have been exposed!

	Cai Ruohong and Hua Junwu are two time bombs planted by Zhou Yang in the art world. They have been carrying out bourgeois dictatorship in the art world, recruiting traitors, forming cliques, and using every means to oppose Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. They have been promoting Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, inciting the ghosts and snakes in the art world to stir up trouble, and launching a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. Under their control, the China Artists Association has actually become a counter-revolutionary organization like the Petőfi Club in Hungary.

	For more than a decade, Cai Ruohong, Hua Junwu, and others have stubbornly stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, using art as a tool and the various newspapers and magazines they control to hold various art exhibitions. They have maliciously slandered, ridiculed, and attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat, spreading a large amount of feudal, capitalist, and revisionist poison throughout the country, causing great harm.

	Since 1963, Cai Ruohong, Hua Junwu, and others, under the protection of the old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture, have resisted Chairman Mao's repeated important instructions on the literary and artistic world. They have continued to play the counter-revolutionary two-faced game, suppressing the revolutionary masses' exposure of the China Artists Association's anti-Party crimes and their criticism of the black articles and black paintings. However, the truth cannot be hidden forever, and the fox's tail cannot be concealed. Now their true faces of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought have been exposed.

	Smashing the China Artists Association, this "Petőfi Club," and exposing the anti-Party leaders Cai Ruohong and Hua Junwu in the art world is a victory for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the art world. We must press on to thoroughly smash the bourgeois dictatorship of Cai Ruohong, Hua Junwu, and others in the art world and eliminate their pernicious influence. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, we will certainly be able to establish and consolidate the leadership of the proletariat in the art world and create a brilliant new proletarian art.

    粉碎蔡若虹、华君武在美术界的资产阶级专政
    编者按：长期隐藏在美术界的反革命修正主义分子蔡若虹、华君武，被革命群众揪出来了，揪得好！
    蔡若虹、华君武是周扬埋在美术界的两颗定时炸弹。他们在美术界大搞资产阶级专政，招降纳叛，结党营私，千方百计地反对毛主席的文艺路线，推行周扬反革命修正主义的文艺黑线，煽动美术界的牛鬼蛇神兴风作浪，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻。在他们把持下的美术家协会，实际上已经沦为匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部式的反革命团体。
    十多年来，蔡若虹、华君武等人顽固地站在资产阶级的反动立场上，利用美术这个工具，利用他们所掌握的各种报刊的美术阵地，举办各种美术展览会，大肆诬蔑、讽刺、攻击无产阶级专政，大量散播封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的毒素，流毒全国，危害极大。
    一九六三年以来，蔡若虹、华君武等人在旧中宣部、旧文化部的包庇下，抗拒毛主席对文艺界多次极关重要的批示，继续玩弄反革命两面派的手法，压制革命群众对美协反党罪行的揭发和对他们反革命的黑文黑画的批判。但是，纸是包不住火的，狐狸的尾巴是藏不住的。现在他们反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的真面目终于被揭露出来了。
    砸烂美协这个“裴多菲俱乐部”，揪出美术界的反党头目蔡若虹、华君武，这是美术界无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。我们必须乘胜追击，彻底粉碎蔡若虹、华君武等在美术界的资产阶级专政，肃清他们的恶劣影响。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，我们一定能够在美术界建立和巩固无产阶级的领导权，创造出光辉灿烂的无产阶级新美术。
