The Red Guards come to our workshop,
In the Zhengzhou Cable Factory in Henan, six workers.
They come for revolutionary connection,
Living with us, receiving training through contact with workers.

The Red Guards come to our workshop,
Together we engage in construction work,
As much dirt on us, they have as much,
Always choosing the heaviest tasks to do.

The Red Guards come to our workshop,
Together we study the "Three Articles,"
Explaining word by word,
Together we reform our worldview.

The Red Guards come to our workshop,
We sit together, heart to heart,
Inspiring fighting spirit to carry out the Cultural Revolution,
Increasing enthusiasm to boost production.

The Red Guards come to our workshop,
Together we rebel,
Fiercely attacking the bourgeois reactionary line,
No obstacles can stop us.

The Red Guards come to our workshop,
Through storms and rains, they see the world,
Learning to swim while swimming,
Becoming steel through a hundred temperings, their resolve even firmer.

　　红卫兵来到俺车间
　　河南郑州电缆厂六个工人红卫兵来到俺车间，进行革命大串连，和俺生活在一起啊，接触工人受锻炼。红卫兵来到俺车间，和俺一起搞基建，俺身上有多少泥巴他们有
  多少啊，活儿总拣重的干。红卫兵来到俺车间，和俺同学“老三篇”，逐字逐句给俺讲啊，共同改造世界观。红卫兵来到俺车间，和俺促膝把心谈，鼓舞斗志搞好文化大革命
  啊，增强干劲促生产。红卫兵来到俺车间，和俺携手来造反，向资产阶级反动路线猛烈
  开火，险滩恶浪无阻拦。红卫兵来到俺车间，经风雨来见世面，游泳之中学游泳啊，百炼成钢志更坚。
