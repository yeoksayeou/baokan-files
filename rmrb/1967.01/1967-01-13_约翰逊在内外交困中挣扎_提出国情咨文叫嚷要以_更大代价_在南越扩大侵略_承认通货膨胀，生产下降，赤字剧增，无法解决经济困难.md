Johnson, in his State of the Union address, shouted that he would pay a "greater price" to expand the aggression in South Vietnam. He admitted to inflation, decreased production, and a surging deficit, acknowledging his inability to solve economic difficulties.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, Washington: On the 10th, U.S. President Johnson presented his State of the Union address to Congress, once again highlighting the desperate and helpless situation of American imperialism.

The 90th U.S. Congress convened amidst a series of severe failures in foreign policy and domestic affairs by the Johnson administration in the previous year, and faced an even bleaker outlook in the new year. Johnson's address indicated that American imperialism has been exhausted by the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people. However, Johnson is unwilling to accept the current failure. In his address, he declared that the United States must steadfastly continue on its current path, stating that the U.S. "will firmly stay in Vietnam." He urged the American people to continue to "pay a greater price, suffer greater losses, and endure more pain." He said that the war "has not yet reached its end."

Johnson's address blatantly exposed the recent "peace talks" scheme by American imperialism and its various accomplices surrounding the Vietnam War, which is merely a smokescreen to cover the expansion of the war. The so-called "halt to bombing" and "gradual de-escalation" are nothing but delaying tactics for American imperialism to gain breathing room before launching a more ferocious attack on the Vietnamese people.

While shouting for the continuation of the Vietnam War, Johnson particularly emphasized the need for the U.S. to tighten its collusion with Soviet revisionism. He said that the U.S. "relationship with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is undergoing a transformation," avoiding "cold war actions and rhetoric." He cited facts to show that last year was a year of global deals between American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, and expressed his intention to continue trading with the Soviet revisionist leadership on issues such as "disarmament" and "nuclear control." He urged Congress to pass trade bills and establish consular treaties with the Soviet Union to promote relations.

Johnson admitted that the U.S. suffered repeated failures and setbacks in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and Western Europe last year.

Johnson indicated that the Vietnam War is not only the number one headache in U.S. foreign policy but also exacerbates various domestic contradictions. He had to admit that the escalating Vietnam War has intensified U.S. inflation, and production has shown a downward trend. Johnson stated that the rise in prices has "exceeded" his expectations, and he has been "concerned" about this. He also revealed that due to the increasing costs of the Vietnam War, the budget deficit for the fiscal year ending June 30 of this year is more than four times higher than the initial estimate in January last year.

The address showed that Johnson has no effective solutions for the series of serious consequences that the Vietnam War has brought to the U.S. economy and other aspects. To make up for the budget deficit and cope with the increasing costs of the Vietnam War, he proposed in the address that starting this year, a 6% surtax on corporate and individual income should be levied. Democratic Senator Hartke said: "This is the wrong prescription at the wrong time, and it will make things worse than they are now."

    约翰逊在内外交困中挣扎
    提出国情咨文叫嚷要以“更大代价”在南越扩大侵略
    承认通货膨胀，生产下降，赤字剧增，无法解决经济困难
    据新华社十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统约翰逊十日向国会提出的国情咨文，又一次突出地说明了美帝国主义焦头烂额、走投无路的处境。
    美国的第九十届国会，是在约翰逊政府去年一年在外交、内政等方面遭受了一连串惨重失败，而在新的一年里又面临着更加暗淡的前景的情况下开幕的。约翰逊的咨文表明，美帝国主义已经被英勇抗战的越南人民拖得疲惫不堪。但是，约翰逊不甘心目前的失败，他在咨文里叫嚷说，美国必须坚定地沿着目前的道路走下去，美国“将坚定地呆在越南。”他要美国人民继续“付出更大的代价、遭受更大的损失、蒙受更多的痛苦”。他说，战争“现在还没有到结束的时候”。
    约翰逊的咨文赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义及其形形色色的帮凶走狗最近围绕着越南战争而玩弄的“和谈”阴谋，不过是掩盖美国扩大战争的一个烟幕。什么“暂停轰炸”、“逐步降级”，完全是美帝国主义的缓兵之计，以便它在得到喘息时间后，向越南人民发动更猖狂的进攻。
    约翰逊在叫嚷继续侵越战争的同时，特别强调美国要同苏联现代修正主义加紧勾结。他说，美国“同苏联和东欧的关系在转变过程中”，“避免了冷战的行动和言词”。他列举事实说明，去年是美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团搞全球大交易的一年，并且表示今年要继续在所谓“裁军”和“控制”核武器等问题上同苏联修正主义领导集团搞交易，他要求国会通过贸易法案和同苏联建立领事条约等，来促进同苏联的关系。
    约翰逊承认，去年美国在非洲、拉丁美洲、中近东、南亚和西欧大陆遭到了一次又一次的失败和挫折。
    约翰逊表明，侵越战争不仅是美国外交上的头号头痛问题，而且也使美国国内各种矛盾激化。他不得不承认，不断“升级”的侵越战争加剧了美国的通货膨胀，同时，生产也出现了下降的趋势。约翰逊表示，物价的上涨幅度“超出了”他的预期，他“一直对这一点感到不安”。他还透露，由于侵越战争开支不断增加，到今年六月三十日截止的本财政年度的预算赤字比去年一月间最初的估计要高出四倍多。
    咨文表明，对于侵越战争给美国财政、经济等各方面带来的一系列严重恶果，约翰逊提不出任何有效的解决办法。为了弥补预算赤字和应付日益增长的侵越战争开支，他在咨文中提出，从今年起要对公司和个人加征百分之六的所得税附加税。民主党参议员哈特基认为：“这是在错误的时间提出的一个错误的药方，它将使事情比现在更加恶化”。
