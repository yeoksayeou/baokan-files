The essence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for power. The proletarian revolutionary masses uniting all revolutionary masses to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements persisting in the bourgeois reactionary line is a more profound and extensive mass struggle for power from the bottom up. This is an extremely arduous and complex task. To accomplish this task, a strong revolutionary organization is indispensable, as is strict organizational and disciplinary unity, and the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

Revolutionary mass organizations born in the storm of revolution have already shown their sharp edge in the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line. Under the white terror, they have demonstrated a clear stance, indomitable will, high organizational discipline, and tenacious fighting spirit, making significant contributions to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The majority of revolutionary rebel organizations have already expanded from a suppressed minority to a power-holding majority. This signifies the growth of revolutionary forces and the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

As the movement deepens and expands, the revolution will inevitably lead to greater unity among the revolutionary forces. The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai have set a brilliant example of such great unity. This great unity is based on Mao Zedong Thought, on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, on thoroughly carrying forward the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, and on achieving a fighting unity through continuous criticism and self-criticism. Such great unity is truly the unity of the proletarian revolutionaries, not a chaotic unity, not a compromising unity, and not an opportunistic unity. This great unity is the fundamental guarantee of the victory of the proletarian revolution. Without this great unity, the seizure of power cannot succeed, and even if power is temporarily seized, it cannot be sustained and consolidated. Just look at how our enemies cleverly implement counter-revolutionary unity at every step of their struggle against us, and we will know how urgently and critically the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries is needed.

However, in light of Chairman Mao's article "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," we feel that there are many erroneous tendencies currently hindering this great unity that need to be rectified.

Extreme democratization and liberalization. Under the white terror of bourgeois dictatorship, under tremendous external pressure, the revolutionary rebel forces were organized so strictly and united so tightly, demonstrating a militarized and combat-ready style. Victory came, external pressure eased, and some organizations and individuals subjectively relaxed their standards, leading to tendencies of extreme democratization and liberalization. Instead of properly organizing themselves within the revolutionary ranks, they detached themselves, doing as they pleased, creating a state of anarchy. This is a serious and harmful tendency. It is a corrosive agent that causes disunity, organizational slackness, passive work, differing opinions, and the breakdown of strict organization and discipline, leading to a rift between leaders and the masses.

Showboating. Stretching one arm to the east and one to the west, unable to handle big tasks, unwilling to handle small ones, reaching out to every "opportunity," seeking personal fame and glory, and actively seeking to make a name for oneself, while resolutely avoiding anonymous work.

Feudalism. Occupying a mountain as a king, practicing hegemony, and implementing a policy of strength. With sufficient supplies, strong troops, abundant materials, and plenty of ammunition, they don't need anyone else. If unity is sought, they naturally take the lead, and others must follow. Otherwise, they lead a group of troops to occupy a hill, blaze a new trail, and show off their might. This is the style of the lumpenproletariat.

Sectarianism and cliquism. These people have narrow vision, failing to see the overall interests of the revolution, the interests of 700 million Chinese people, or the interests of the world proletarian revolution. They only see their own small group, small clique, or small sect. They gather a group to attack another, using principle-less struggles to strike down those with differing opinions. This is an enlarged form of individualism.

In addition, there are various forms of individualism, all of which are corrosive agents hindering the great unity of the proletarian revolution. These bad "isms" are not proletarian but bourgeois and petty-bourgeois. They cannot demonstrate tenacity, organization, discipline, firmness, and unity on any major issue. They cause the revolutionary ranks to disperse, waver, lose fighting spirit, and ultimately lead to revolutionary failure.

These bad "isms" are products of the small-scale production mode and the bourgeoisie's insatiable desire for fame and profit. They can ultimately be summed up in one character: "self." This "self" is the bourgeois command center in many comrades' minds. We are also engaged in a struggle for power between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in our minds. If we do not seize the power in our minds for the proletariat, that is, if we do not use Mao Zedong Thought to occupy the command center in our minds, then even if we seize power from those taking the capitalist road, it would be meaningless.

We are simultaneously engaged in two revolutions: the revolution to transform the objective world and the revolution to transform the subjective world. We are simultaneously engaged in two struggles for power: seizing power from those taking the capitalist road and seizing power from the "self" in our minds. Only by thoroughly seizing power from the "self" in our minds can we ensure the complete victory of seizing power from those taking the capitalist road. Seizing power in the mind is a painful process. However, this struggle must be waged. It requires the courage to confront the enemy. The best way to wage this struggle is to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and immerse ourselves in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in factories and rural areas, combining with workers and peasants. The combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants is the only way to overcome the weaknesses of intellectuals and achieve revolutionization. The great unity of revolutionary workers and revolutionary peasants is the core and main force of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries nationwide.

We have launched a comprehensive struggle for power against those taking the capitalist road nationwide.

The class enemies are desperately seeking every crack in our ranks, sowing discord, creating division, and destroying the great unity of the revolutionaries. The class enemies say: Let them fight, let them engage in mutual destruction, let them seize our power, let them seize power from each other, let them act independently. Then they wait on the sidelines to laugh at our misfortune.

How will we respond to the enemy?

Implement the ironclad great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries! This is our response.

The proletarian revolutionaries have deeply understood the great significance of great unity from the great revolutionary teachers Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, from our great leader Chairman Mao, and from the practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past few months. They will quickly organize into a mighty, indomitable, and loyal revolutionary army. The day of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries is the day of the complete downfall of the handful of power-holders within the Party taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements persisting in the bourgeois reactionary line.

Revolutionary intellectuals, revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary cadres, and all revolutionary masses unite!

Let the handful of power-holders within the Party taking the capitalist road and all ghosts and monsters tremble before the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries!

Down with showboating! Down with parochialism! Down with sectarianism!

Long live the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries!

    打倒“私”字，实行革命造反派大联合
　　首都红卫兵第三司令部
    无产阶级文化大革命的实质，就是无产阶级向资产阶级夺权的斗争。无产阶级革命派团结一切革命群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子夺权，是比民主革命在更大深度上的自下而上的群众性的夺权。这是极其艰巨而复杂的任务。要完成这个任务，非有坚强的革命组织不可，非有极严格的组织性纪律性不可，非有无产阶级革命队伍的大联合不可。
    在革命的暴风雨中诞生的革命的群众组织，在和资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，已初露锋芒。在白色恐怖下，他们表现了鲜明的立场、坚韧的意志、高度的组织纪律性和顽强的战斗力，为捍卫毛主席的革命路线立下功劳。绝大部分革命造反派的组织，已经从被压抑的少数扩大到掌权的多数。这标志着革命力量的壮大，标志着毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利。
    随着运动的深入发展，革命在更大范围内的开展，必然导致革命队伍在更大范围的联合。上海的革命造反派已经为我们树立了这种大联合的光辉榜样。这种大联合，就是在毛泽东思想基础上的大联合，就是在毛主席革命路线基础上的大联合，就是在彻底发扬无产阶级革命造反精神基础上的大联合，就是在不断地批评和自我批评中求得的战斗的大联合。这样的大联合，才真正是无产阶级革命派的大联合，而不是乌七八糟的大联合，不是调和折衷的大联合，不是机会主义的大联合。这种大联合，是无产阶级革命胜利的根本保证。没有这种大联合，夺权就不能成功，即使暂时夺了权，也不能持久和巩固。只要看看我们的敌人在和我们斗争的每一个步骤上是怎样巧妙地实行着反革命的联合，我们就会知道，无产阶级革命派的大联合是多么地需要，多么地刻不容缓。
    但是，对照毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》一文检查，我们感到目前有许多阻碍着这种大联合的错误倾向需要纠正。
    极端民主化、自由化。在资产阶级专政的白色恐怖下，在巨大的外部压力下，革命造反派的队伍曾经组织得多么严格，团结得多么紧密，表现了军事化战斗化的作风。胜利了，外部压力小了，某些组织，某些人，主观上放松了要求，就出现了极端民主化、自由化的倾向。不是把自己恰当地组织在革命队伍的一环上，而是游离出来，愿怎么干就怎么干，造成无政府状态。这是一种严重的恶劣倾向。它是一种腐蚀剂，使团结涣散，组织松懈，工作消极，意见分歧，破坏了严密的组织和纪律，使领导和群众之间发生隔离。
    风头主义。东伸一条胳膊，西伸一条腿，大事干不了，小事不愿干，把触角伸到每一个“利所能及”的场合里去，为自己树碑立传，沽名钓誉，出风头的事大干特干，“隐姓埋名”的事坚决不干。
    山头主义。占山为王，搞霸权主义，实力政策。我的粮草足，我的兵马壮，我的材料多，我的子弹多，求不着你们。要联合嘛，我是当然的领导，你们得听我的。否则，我领一班人马，占一个山头，杀一条“新路”，显我的威风。这就是那种流氓无产者的作风。
    宗派主义、小团体主义。这种人眼光狭小，看不到革命的整体利益，看不到七亿中国人民的利益，看不到世界无产阶级革命的利益，看到的只是自己那一小帮人，那个小团体，那个小宗派。它拉一伙，打一伙，利用无原则的斗争，打击持不同意见的人。这是稍稍放大了的个人主义。
    此外，还有各种各样、形形色色的个人主义，都是妨碍无产阶级革命大联合的腐蚀剂。这种种的坏“主义”，都不是无产阶级的东西，而是资产阶级和小资产阶级的东西。它在任何重大问题上，都不能表现出坚韧性、组织性、纪律性、坚定性和团结性。它使革命的队伍离散、动摇，丧失战斗力，不能联合，而最终导致革命的失败。
    这种种坏“主义”是那种小生产方式和资产阶级对于名利的无穷的贪欲生出来的。它可以最终归结在一个“私”字上。这个“私”字，就是很多同志头脑里的那个资产阶级司令部。我们头脑里同样进行着无产阶级和资产阶级的夺权斗争。如果不把自己头脑的“权”夺到无产阶级的手里来，也就是说，不用毛泽东思想去占领我们头脑里的司令部的话，那末，即使我们把权从走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺过来，那也是没有什么意义的。
    我们同时进行着两个革命：改造客观世界的革命和改造主观世界的革命。我们同时进行着两个夺权斗争：夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，夺自己头脑里“私”字的权。只有在思想上彻底夺了“私”字的权，才能保证夺走资本主义道路当权派的权的彻底胜利。头脑里的夺权是一个痛苦的过程。但是，必须进行这个斗争。这需要有刺刀见红的勇敢精神。而进行这个斗争的最好办法，是按照毛主席的教导，投入到工厂和农村无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中去，和工农相结合。知识分子和工农相结合，乃是克服知识分子种种弱点实行革命化的唯一途径。革命工人、革命农民的大联合，是全国无产阶级革命派大联合的核心和主力。
    我们在全国范围内向走资本主义道路的当权派展开全面的夺权斗争了。
    阶级敌人在拚命地寻找着我们队伍内的每一点缝隙，挑拨、离间、破坏革命派的大联合。阶级敌人说：让他们去斗吧，去混战吧！让他们去夺我们的权吧，互相去夺吧，各自为政吧。然后他们在旁边等着看我们的笑话。
    我们将怎样回答敌人？
    实现无产阶级革命派钢铁般的大联合！这就是我们的回答。
    无产阶级革命派已经从伟大的革命导师马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林那里，从我们伟大领袖毛主席那里，从文化大革命几个月的实践中，真正深刻地体会到大联合的伟大意义，他们将很快组织成一支无比勇敢、无比坚实、无比忠诚的浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。无产阶级革命派大联合之日，就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子彻底垮台之时。
    革命的知识分子和革命工人、革命农民、革命干部及一切革命群众联合起来！
    让党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神在无产阶级革命派大联合面前发抖吧！
    打倒风头主义！打倒本位主义！打倒宗派主义！
    无产阶级革命派大联合万岁！
