Laotian patriotic military and civilians have demonstrated the mighty power of people's war in the past year, crushing the attacks by the U.S. and its lackeys on the liberated areas and achieving brilliant victories. They have annihilated more than 11,902 enemy troops and shot down 203 enemy aircraft, steadily consolidating and expanding the liberated areas.

According to a recent broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, the spokesperson for the Lao People's Liberation Army High Command read out a communiqué at a press conference held in a certain location in Sam Neua Province on the 19th, announcing the brilliant achievements of the Laotian military and civilians in the past year.

The communiqué pointed out that U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, in an attempt to turn Laos into a new type of U.S. colony and a base for aggression, launched multiple attacks on the Laotian liberated areas over the past year. They dispatched large numbers of bandits to infiltrate the liberated areas, attempting to undermine the stable foundation of the liberated areas. While conducting ground "sweeping" operations, the U.S. and its lackeys also deployed nearly 20,000 aircraft to conduct savage bombing raids on the liberated areas controlled by patriotic forces, even spreading chemical poisons.

The communiqué stated that the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have aroused the indignation of the Laotian patriotic military and civilians. They have carried forward the spirit of patriotism and the glorious tradition of courage and indomitable will, channeling their hatred into their guns, resolutely fighting back against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and achieving brilliant victories.

According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, the Laotian military and civilians have annihilated 11,902 enemy troops, including 6,325 killed, 2,970 wounded, and 2,607 captured or surrendered. They have seized 2,727 weapons of various kinds, hundreds of tons of ammunition and military supplies, and shot down 203 aircraft of various types belonging to the U.S. and its lackeys. At the same time, they have expanded the liberated areas, freeing 20,000 people.

The communiqué said that the above-mentioned brilliant victories have foiled the U.S. imperialism's plot of gradual encroachment and defeated the U.S.'s so-called "air superiority," further demonstrating that the Laotian military and civilians are becoming stronger and stronger in battle and are invincible to any enemy.

The communiqué said that the above-mentioned victories also indicate that the Laotian patriotic armed forces are growing and strengthening day by day. The main forces have made rapid progress in politics, technology, and tactics. Of particular importance is the fact that guerrilla warfare has flourished across the country. In addition to relying on simple weapons such as rifles, traps, and landmines to cooperate with local forces and main forces to annihilate the enemy, the guerrilla forces in various places are also actively developing production and participating in various support work for the front lines.

The communiqué called on the Laotian military and civilians to further heighten their vigilance, carry forward the spirit of courage and indomitability, overcome all difficulties, and fight bravely to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on the 27th, the patriotic military and civilians of the Laotian provinces of Saravane, Attapeu, and Bokeo achieved brilliant results on January 17th in their counterattack against the enemy's large-scale "sweeping" operation involving ten battalions.

According to preliminary reports, the patriotic military and civilians of these three provinces have killed 71 enemy troops and injured many more, destroying one mortar and one recoilless rifle.

The report said that on January 15th, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, with the support of many aircraft and artillery, launched a large-scale "sweeping" operation against the liberated areas of Saravane, Attapeu, and Bokeo provinces with more than ten battalions. The local militia, guerrilla forces, and local troops closely coordinated with the main forces to immediately launch a fierce counterattack against the invading enemy. The ongoing heroic anti-"sweeping" battle is still in progress.

Another report by the same radio station said that the local troops and guerrilla forces in the Phou Khao region of the Laotian province of Khammouane launched a series of counterattacks against enemy incursions on January 1st, 3rd, and 4th, killing 10 enemy troops and seizing a batch of weapons.

　  去年歼敌一万多击落敌机二百零三架
    新华社康开电　老挝爱国军民在过去一年里，发挥人民战争的无比威力，粉碎了美国及其走狗对解放区的进攻，取得辉煌战果，共歼灭敌人一万一千九百零二名，击落敌机二百零三架，使解放区不断得到巩固和扩大。
    据巴特寮电台最近广播，老挝人民解放军最高指挥部发言人，十九日在桑怒省某地举行的记者招待会上宣读了一项公报，公布了老挝军民去年的辉煌战绩。
    公报指出，美帝国主义及其走狗为了把老挝变成美国的新型殖民地和侵略基地，一年来对老挝解放区发动了多次进攻，并派遣大批土匪潜入解放区，妄图破坏解放区的稳固基础。在发动地面“扫荡”的同时，美国及其走狗集团还出动近二万架次飞机，对爱国力量的解放区进行野蛮轰炸，甚至撒放化学毒药。
    公报说，美帝国主义及其走狗犯下的滔天罪行，激起了老挝爱国军民的无比愤慨，他们发扬爱国主义精神和英勇不屈的光荣传统，把仇恨凝聚在枪口上，坚决抗击美帝国主义及其走狗，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    据不完全统计，在过去一年里，老挝军民共消灭敌人一万一千九百零二名，其中打死敌人六千三百二十五名，打伤二千九百七十名，俘虏和迫降二千六百零七名；缴获各种武器二千七百二十七件，弹药和军用物资数百吨；击落美国及其走狗的各种类型飞机二百零三架。同时并扩大了解放区，使二万人民获得解放。
    公报说，老挝军民的上述辉煌胜利，粉碎了美帝国主义的蚕食进攻阴谋，挫败了美国的所谓“空中优势”，进一步表明老挝军民越战越强，是任何敌人无法战胜的。
    公报说，上述的胜利还表明，老挝爱国武装力量不断成长和壮大，主力部队在政治、技术和战术方面，都有了迅速的进步。特别重要的是，游击战争在全国各地得到蓬勃发展。各地游击队除了依靠土枪、陷阱、地雷等简便武器，同地方部队和主力部队配合消灭敌人以外，还积极发展生产，参加支援前线的各种工作。
    公报号召老挝军民进一步提高警惕，发扬英勇不屈的精神，克服一切困难，英勇战斗，以打败美帝国主义及其走狗。
    新华社康开二十八日电　据巴特寮电台二十七日广播：老挝沙拉湾、阿速坡和巴色三省爱国军民，一月十七日在反击敌人十个营发动的大规模“扫荡”中，取得了光辉的战果。
    据初步消息，这三个省的爱国军民共打死敌人七十一名，打伤许多名，击毁迫击炮和无后座力炮各一门。
    报道说，美帝国主义及其走狗一月十五日纠集了十多个营的兵力，在许多飞机和大炮的掩护下，对沙拉湾、阿速坡和巴色三省的解放区发动大规模“扫荡”。当地民兵游击队、地方部队同主力部队密切配合，立即给来犯的敌人以迎头痛击。目前这场英勇的反“扫荡”战斗，还在继续进行中。
    另据这家电台广播，老挝川圹省富窍地区地方部队和游击队，在一月一日、三日和四日三天中，接连反击敌人的进攻，打死敌人十名，缴获一批武器。
