After receiving the notice that Comrade Xiong Yaozhang was to be transferred to local work, I wanted to talk to him about this matter. In the evening, he was studying the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune." I thought this was a good opportunity, so I went over and sat beside him. He saw me and said, "Comrade Commander, why could Comrade Bethune treat the Chinese War of Resistance against Japan as his own cause?" I heard this and asked, "What do you think?" He thought for a moment and said, "He had a red heart dedicated to serving the people of his own country and the people of the world." I quickly said, "Yes, the entire world proletarian revolutionary cause is a whole, and the Chinese revolution is a part of it..." Before I could finish, he continued, "Then every piece of our work is a screw in the entire world proletarian revolution. I will do every piece of work well, like polishing a machine's screw to make it shine, and be a shining screw of the world revolution." I asked him, "How will you do it?" He quickly replied, "Follow Chairman Mao's words and serve the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly." These words shone with heroic spirit. When I told him he would be transferred to local work, he did not hesitate and said, "Alright! I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's words."

The next day, before dawn, he got up. Someone asked him if he couldn't sleep. He said, "Yes! I thought about it all night. I am very sad because I didn't do a good job here and didn't play the role of a screw well." After saying this, he rushed off to work. He was mending mats, twisting ropes, touching this and that, busy all the time. At noon, just before he left, I asked him if he had packed all his things. He said, "I packed them all early. This!" He took out a shiny copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." "The weapons to transform thoughts, defeat enemies, overcome difficulties, and complete tasks are all here! Comrade Commander, I will definitely achieve new results at my new post and report to the Party." He realized his ideal of being a shining screw of the world revolution with his actual actions; he reported to all the people of China and all the people of the world with his heroic achievements.

    做世界革命闪闪发光的螺丝钉
    陈诗图
    我接到要熊耀章同志转业地方工作的通知后，想找他谈谈这件事。晚上，他正在学习《纪念白求恩》这篇光辉著作。我想，这是个好机会，打铁趁火。我走过去坐在他身边，他看见我就说：“指导员，白求恩同志为什么能把中国的抗日战争当作他自己的事业？”我一听，反问一句：“你说呢？”他想了想说：“他有一颗为本国人民服务和为世界人民服务的红心。”我忙说：“对，整个世界无产阶级革命事业是一个整体，中国革命是一个组成部分……”我的话还未完，他接着说：“那么我们的每一项工作都是整个世界无产阶级革命的一颗螺丝钉，我要把每一项工作都做好，像把机器的螺丝钉擦得亮亮的一样，做世界革命闪闪发光的螺丝钉。”我问他：“你怎么去做呢？”他很快地说：“听毛主席的话，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务。”一句话，闪耀着英雄的光辉思想。当我说要他转业到地方工作时，他毫不犹豫地说：“行！我一定听毛主席的话，一定照毛主席的话去做。”
    第二天，天还没亮，他就起床了，别人问他是睡不着吗？他说：“是呀！我昨晚想了一夜，我很难过，因为我没有在这里把工作做好，没有很好地起到一颗螺丝钉的作用。”说完就跑去工作了。编碰垫，搓缆绳，摸这动那，忙个不停。中午临别了，我问他东西都带好没有，他说：“早带齐了。这！”他拿出金光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。“改造思想，战胜敌人，克服困难，完成任务的武器都有了！指导员，我到新的工作岗位，一定做出新的成绩向党汇报。”
    他用他的实际行动，实现了他“做世界革命闪闪发光的螺丝钉”的理想；他用他英雄的业绩向全中国人民、向全世界人民作了最有力的汇报。
