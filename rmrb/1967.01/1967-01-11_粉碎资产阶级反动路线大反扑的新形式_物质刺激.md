After reading the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" issued by the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and ten other revolutionary mass organizations, we are greatly moved. The revolutionary rebels in Shanghai have done a great job. They have raised high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and have sounded the call for a continued and fierce counterattack against the counterrevolutionary line.

The issues they have raised do not only exist in Shanghai but also throughout the country. In Harbin, we have similar situations. Those in power who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the counterrevolutionary line of the bourgeoisie, in order to keep their positions, evade the masses' struggle, and use various tricks to sabotage Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." In the early stages of the movement, they used the pretext of focusing on production to suppress the masses from rising up in revolution. Now, when the masses have broken through their various obstacles and risen up in rebellion, they again use the excuse of "caring for the masses' livelihood and improving living conditions" to implement material incentives, such as supplementary wages and increased benefits, using revisionist methods to corrupt the revolutionary will of the workers, disintegrate the revolutionary ranks of the workers, incite the masses to fight among themselves, shift the direction of the struggle, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a new form of the counterrevolutionary line of the bourgeoisie's rampant comeback.

The revolutionary workers and revolutionary students who have gone to the factories in Harbin have timely exposed these counterrevolutionary plots. They firmly say: We are Chairman Mao's workers. We must act according to the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Sixteen Points. We want revolution, not this money. Those who want to use the state's money to buy us off are mistaken. We absolutely do not allow the serious political struggle to be turned into an economic struggle. Whoever dares to do so, we will not let them succeed. These people in power who are taking the capitalist road have not settled their old accounts, and now they have added this new and heinous crime. We must settle accounts with them thoroughly. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao is a great innovation in the international communist movement and has extremely important significance. We, the working class, have taken on the glorious responsibility. We not only want to carry out the socialist revolution in China to the end but also want to support the people of all countries to achieve the final victory of the world revolution.

The revolutionary workers in Harbin, through debates, big-character posters, and other means, have exposed the evil intentions of these counterrevolutionary revisionists and firmly carried out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, engaging in a resolute struggle against those in power who are taking the capitalist road.

The "Declaration to the People of Shanghai," this extremely important document, is very good. It says that supporting or not supporting, executing or not executing Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" is a major issue of principle. We are determined to stand with the revolutionary workers of Harbin, to wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, to expose and smash all forms of the new comeback of the counterrevolutionary line of the bourgeoisie, to fight down, fight over, and fight to the end the handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    粉碎资产阶级反动路线大反扑的新形式——物质刺激
    哈尔滨军事工程学院红色造反团驻京联络站
    读了上海工人革命造反总司令部等十一个革命群众组织的《告上海全市人民书》，我们十分激动。上海的革命造反派干得很好，他们高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，吹响了继续向资产阶级反动路线猛烈反击的号角。
    他们提出的问题，不仅上海存在，而且全国也存在。我们哈尔滨市就有这种情况。那些走资本主义道路的当权派，和顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，为了保住自己的乌纱帽，逃避群众的斗争，玩弄种种花招，破坏毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。运动初期，他们以抓生产为名，压制群众起来革命；现在，当群众冲破他们的种种阻挠，起来造反，他们又假借“关心群众生活，搞好生活”为名，大搞物质刺激，以补助工资，增加福利等修正主义手法，来腐蚀工人革命意志，瓦解工人革命队伍，挑起群众斗群众，转移斗争的大方向，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。这是资产阶级反动路线猖狂反扑的新形式。
    哈尔滨市的广大革命工人和下厂的革命师生，及时识破了这些家伙的反革命罪恶阴谋，针锋相对地展开斗争。他们坚定地说：我们是毛主席的工人，一定要按伟大领袖毛主席的教导办事，按十六条办事。我们要革命，不要这些钱。谁想要慷国家之慨，用国家的钱收买我们革命工人，那就打错了算盘。我们绝不允许把严肃的政治斗争，转变为经济斗争。谁要胆大妄为，我们绝对不让他们得逞。这些走资本主义道路的当权派旧账未还，又添了这一笔罪恶滔天的新账，我们一定要同他们彻底清算。伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场文化大革命，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举，具有极其重大的意义。我们工人阶级，担负了光荣的责任。我们不但要把中国的社会主义革命进行到底，还要支援各国人民，取得世界革命的最后胜利。
    哈尔滨市的革命职工，通过辩论会、大字报等方式，戳穿了这些反革命修正主义分子的恶毒心肠，坚定地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线，同走资本主义道路的当权派进行了坚决的斗争。
    《告上海全市人民书》这个极其重要的文件说得很好，拥护不拥护、执行不执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，是一个大是大非的问题。我们决心同哈尔滨市的革命职工站在一起，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，揭穿和粉碎资产阶级反动路线的一切形式的新反扑，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
