	Jiangxi Agricultural Chemical Plant revolutionary workers firmly remember Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp the revolution and promote production," steadfastly guard their battle stations, and resist adverse currents.

	They say: Even if the sky were to fall, we cannot stand by and watch the national interest suffer. They themselves grasp the destiny of the Cultural Revolution and production, and the revolutionary situation is getting better and better, with production entering a new high tide.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, January 16th — The revolutionary workers of Jiangxi Agricultural Chemical Plant, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have resisted adverse currents, overcome numerous difficulties, and in the face of attempts by those who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line to incite some people to leave the factory, they have taken the destiny of the Cultural Revolution and production into their own hands, striving for victory in both revolution and production.

	Recently, Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast to the nation the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" issued by the revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, as well as the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee. This has greatly inspired the revolutionary workers of Jiangxi Agricultural Chemical Plant. They enthusiastically shout: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" They say: "Chairman Mao cares for us the most and supports us the most, adding ten thousand times, a hundred thousand times the strength to us."

	Previously, the Agricultural Chemical Plant, under the control of a handful of capitalists who were in power and stubbornly insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressed the revolutionary masses in the name of "focusing on production." The revolutionary rebels resisted the adverse currents, established a revolutionary organization — the "Defenders of Mao Zedong Thought" Combat Brigade, and launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalists within the party who were taking the capitalist road, smashing their plots. Then, they deceived and misled some people inside and outside the factory to leave their production posts, stop work, and stop production, attempting to achieve their goal of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The revolutionary rebel workers were indignant and firmly declared that the revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not only good at destroying an old world but will also be good at building a new world. We revolutionary rebels, when we think of socialist construction, think of the entire national production plan, feel that we are shouldering the heavy burden of revolution. How can workers, who are the masters of the state, not care about the state's interests? They firmly said: We absolutely cannot stop work, absolutely cannot stop production, absolutely cannot fall into the trap of the handful of capitalists who are taking the capitalist road and insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and absolutely cannot be fooled by them!

	The revolutionary rebels gathered in the workshops and, during pre-shift meetings, read Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again, and sang the songs of Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, striving for victory." Great Mao Zedong Thought has shown them the way forward and given them the strength and wisdom to overcome difficulties.

	Although there were fewer people, they resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "no matter in any difficult and arduous situation, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight," and insisted on going to work and producing as usual.

	Units directly serving production also rushed into battle. When some key personnel in the chemical analysis room left, the young new hands of the revolutionary rebels took their place and took on the chemical analysis work. When some production technicians left and there was no one to inspect the products, the old workers of the revolutionary rebels stepped forward to guard the technical inspection post. They completed the production tasks of the entire factory faster and better than before.

	A handful of capitalists who were taking the capitalist road tried to stop the revolutionary rebels from continuing production and incited some people to attack the revolutionary rebels.

	The revolutionary workers of Jiangxi Agricultural Chemical Plant, armed with great Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly carried out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat within the factory, posting a large number of big-character posters, exposing, criticizing, and denouncing the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly continuing production, making production even better. During this period, many revolutionary rebel organizations in factories, schools, and other units gave them strong support, providing great encouragement and strength. Some people asked them, couldn't you stop production to fight them? Couldn't you leave your production posts to go to Beijing to report on them? The revolutionary rebels who listen to Chairman Mao the most always think of the interests of the revolution, not their personal safety. They said: "Grasping the revolution and promoting production is Chairman Mao's great call, an important guarantee for carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. Even if the sky were to fall, we cannot put down production and watch the national interest suffer."

	They said excitedly with hearts full of faith in the great leader Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao understands us revolutionary rebels the most and supports us revolutionary rebels the most, believing that we can stand firm and withstand the stormy waves, relying on us to unite the majority of the masses to carry the revolution to the end!" Some people bought train tickets to Beijing three times, but they did not take a single one, insisting on staying and fighting, and achieving victory. They deeply felt from the struggle that only by grasping the revolution can production be promoted and production be improved. Now, under the personal care and great support of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary rebels are continuously developing and growing stronger, uniting, and the revolutionary situation is getting better and better, with the production of the entire factory entering a new and magnificent high tide.

    江西农药厂革命职工牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示
    坚守战斗岗位  顶住歪风逆流
    他们说：就是天压下来，也不能眼看着国家利益受损失。他们自己掌握文化大革命和生产的命运，革命形势越来越好，生产出现新高潮
    据新华社南昌十六日电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的江西农药厂革命职工，顶住歪风逆流，战胜重重困难，在坚持资产阶级反动路线的人煽动一部分人离厂的情况下，自己掌握文化大革命的命运，自己掌握生产和工作的命运，争取革命和生产双胜利。
    最近，毛主席亲自决定向全国广播上海革命造反团体发出的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，以及中央的贺电，给江西农药厂革命职工以巨大鼓舞。他们热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们说：“毛主席最关心我们，最支持我们，给我们增添了千倍万倍的力量。”
    前一个时候农药厂在一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的把持下，以“抓生产”为名，压制革命群众。革命造反派顶住歪风逆流，建立了革命的组织——“保卫毛泽东思想战士”战斗大队，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了猛烈攻击，击破了他们的阴谋。于是，他们就欺骗、蒙蔽厂内外的一部分人离开生产岗位，停工停产，企图以此达到他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的。革命造反派的职工个个义愤填膺，坚定地表示，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派，不但善于破坏一个旧世界，还将善于建设一个新世界。我们革命造反派，一想到社会主义建设，想到国家整个生产计划，就感到自己双肩上挑着革命重担。工人是国家的主人，怎么连国家的利益也不顾呢？他们坚定地说：绝对不能停工，绝对不能停产，绝对不能中一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的阴谋诡计，绝对不能上他们的当！
    革命造反派集中在车间里，在班前会上，一遍又一遍地读毛主席语录，一遍又一遍地高唱毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”伟大的毛泽东思想给他们指明了前进的道路，给了他们战胜困难的力量和智慧。
    人虽少了，他们坚决遵照毛主席的“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去”的教导，坚持上班，照常生产。
    直接为生产服务的单位，也都紧张地投入战斗。化验室的一些主要化验人员走了，革命造反派年轻的新手主动顶上去，负起化验工作。一些生产技术干部走了，产品鉴定没人管了，革命造反派的老工人就站出来把住技术鉴定的大关。他们比过去更快更好地完成了全厂生产任务。
    一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为了阻止革命造反派坚持生产，又煽动一些人围攻革命造反派。
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的江西农药厂革命职工，毫不畏惧，他们坚定不移地在厂内开展无产阶级文化大革命运动，贴出大量大字报，揭露、批判、声讨资产阶级反动路线的新反扑的罪行，坚定不移地坚持生产，把生产搞得更好。在这段时期内，许多工厂、学校等单位的革命造反派大力声援，给了他们巨大的鼓舞和力量。有些人向他们提出，难道你们就不能停产同他们作斗争吗？难道不能离开生产岗位上北京告他们吗？最听毛主席的话的革命造反派，时刻想到的不是个人的安危，而是革命的利益。他们说：“抓革命，促生产是毛主席提出的伟大号召，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的重要保证，就是天压下来，也不能放下生产，眼看着国家的利益受损失。”
    他们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限信仰的心情，激动地说：“毛主席最了解我们革命造反派，最支持我们革命造反派，相信我们能在大风大浪中站得稳顶得住，依靠我们争取团结大多数群众把革命进行到底！”有些人先后三次买了去北京的车票，他们一张都没有要，硬是坚持下来，进行斗争，取得了胜利。他们从斗争中深深地体会到：只有抓好革命，才能促进生产，搞好生产。现在，革命造反派在毛主席亲切关怀和巨大支持下，正在不断发展壮大，正在联合起来，革命形势越来越好，全厂的生产正随之出现一个轰轰烈烈的新高潮。
