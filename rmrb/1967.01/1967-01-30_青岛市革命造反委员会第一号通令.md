New China News Agency, Jinan, January 29th - The full text of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee's First Order is as follows:

The Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee was established on January 22, 1967, and has seized all the power of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and the Qingdao Municipal People's Committee. To consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, fully carry forward the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, the following order is issued:

1. All powers of the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Qingdao Municipal People's Committee shall, from this moment on, be entirely under the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee. The former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Qingdao Municipal People's Committee shall be sealed off and all their activities shall be halted.

2. The former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee Secretary, Standing Committee members, Committee members, heads of various departments, the former Qingdao Municipal Mayor, Deputy Mayors, heads of various bureaus, and section chiefs shall report to the Committee within three days of the issuance of this order for disposition. Other general staff members shall remain at their posts, follow orders, and continue their work as usual.

3. All directives and documents issued by the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Qingdao Municipal People's Committee since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on May 16, 1966 (excluding documents forwarded by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group) shall be null and void from this moment on.

4. All power belongs to the revolutionary rebels. The power of all levels of party and government organs, industry, basic construction, transportation, cultural education, medical and health units, and all mass organizations in Qingdao, which have been seized by those who take the capitalist road and stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, shall be seized by the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses. Leaders at all levels who implement the bourgeois reactionary line and those who have been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line but have not yet corrected their errors shall have no right to seize power.

5. Strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and resolutely implement the regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on strengthening public security work during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Call on all revolutionary rebel organizations and revolutionary masses in the city to actively assist and supervise the implementation. For those who disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, disrupt revolutionary order, and disrupt the dictatorship of the proletariat, they shall be severely punished according to law.

6. Call on all revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in the city to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production." Actively participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution while firmly holding onto production posts, becoming models of "grasp revolution, promote production." Resolutely implement the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's notice on opposing economism, adhere to the dictatorship of the proletariat, adhere to the socialist direction, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

7. Due to the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee's unyielding execution and stubborn adherence to the bourgeois reactionary line, the Committee solemnly declares: All directives related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution issued by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Committee shall be rejected. The Committee calls on all revolutionary rebels in the province to unite and seize back the power held by a handful of those who take the capitalist road and stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line within the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, and place it firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary rebels!
