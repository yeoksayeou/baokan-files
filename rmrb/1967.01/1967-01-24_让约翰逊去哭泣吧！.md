Let Johnson Cry!

The American gangster Johnson recently threw out a stinking State of the Union address. In this address, he pretended to talk about the "Chinese problem."

Why is Johnson so "interested" in the Chinese problem? It is because China, under the leadership of our most, most great leader Chairman Mao, has made Beijing the center of longing for revolutionary people around the world, and has made China the Jian Mountains of the world revolution. Especially China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has shaken the world and has an immeasurable and profound impact. The giant standing in the East of the world, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has frightened Johnson, making him have to pay special attention to China and treat China as the number one enemy of American imperialism.

Preparing to launch a military attack on China is Johnson's consistent policy. But Johnson has not forgotten another tactic, which is to try to promote the "peaceful evolution" of China.

In his address, Johnson said, "We will continue to hope for reconciliation between the people of mainland China and the world family."

What is the "world family" that Johnson talks about? It is the world counter-revolutionary camp of imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU, and the reactionaries of various countries.

What does Johnson mean by "reconciliation"? It is to hope that the bad elements like Khrushchev, who are hidden within our country and whom we have already exposed, will carry out the restoration of capitalism and go to join their counter-revolutionary camp. The "reconciliation" between China and the "world family" that Johnson hopes for is the delusion that one day China will also undergo a "peaceful evolution" like the Soviet Union, and like the Soviet revisionists, collude and conspire with American imperialism to suppress the revolutionary people of the world.

Pah! Johnson, you are dreaming in broad daylight!

Under the guidance of the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is unfolding across the vast territory of our motherland, giving the American gangster Johnson a blow to the head. Johnson's dream of "peaceful evolution" has been completely shattered. The big and small Khrushchev-like bad elements who have been occupying some of our positions have been or are being exposed by us Red Guards, by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and by the revolutionary people, one by one, and are being overthrown. Every position in the motherland will be thoroughly occupied by the great Mao Zedong Thought. We have the extremely brilliant and radiant Mao Zedong Thought, and we have the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally opened by Chairman Mao. The third and fourth generations of China will definitely be bright red! The descendants of China for generations to come will definitely be bright red! Johnson's plot to achieve "reconciliation" between China and the "world family" will never succeed!

Johnson also said that if China "concentrates its great strength and wisdom on improving the welfare of its own people, we will be the first to applaud and welcome it." In other words, Johnson wants the Chinese people to only mind their own business and not support the world revolution.

Our most, most great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose."

Johnson is very afraid that we will support the world revolution, so we must even more firmly hold high the banner of the world revolution and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world. We Red Guards, Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, must enthusiastically respond to the great call of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and always support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world, taking the world revolution as our mission, and overthrowing imperialism led by the United States! Overthrowing modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU! Overthrowing all reactionaries!

Johnson's State of the Union address is a genuine counter-revolutionary manifesto, but the Soviet revisionist leadership clique treats it as a treasure, publishing it in newspapers and magazines, and even adding a photo of Johnson smiling to praise him. This is not surprising, as the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are of the same ilk.

Chairman Mao said: "The enemy will not perish by itself." Johnson and his ilk will certainly not perish by themselves. They always want to use the two tactics of military attack and "peaceful evolution" to overthrow the new China of proletarian dictatorship, and we must seriously deal with them. We Red Guards, the new generation of the Chinese proletariat, must closely follow our most, most great leader Chairman Mao, and forever make revolution. Not only make revolution in China, but also make revolution in the world. We will, together with the revolutionary people of the world, sweep away all the harmful insects! Whether it is the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, or the reactionaries of various countries, they will all be swept away by the iron broom of revolution!

The world belongs to the people!

The brilliant light of invincible Mao Zedong Thought will shine all over the world!

### 让约翰逊去哭泣吧！

专栏：红卫兵谈天下大事

　　让约翰逊去哭泣吧！
    美国强盗头子约翰逊，不久前抛出了臭不可闻的国情咨文。在这个咨文中，他装腔作势地谈论着什么“中国问题”。
    为什么约翰逊对中国问题如此“感兴趣”呢？就是因为中国在最最伟大的领袖毛主席英明领导下，北京成了世界革命人民向往的中心，中国成了世界革命的井冈山。特别是中国的文化大革命，震动全世界，有着不可估量的深远影响。屹立于世界东方的、高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国巨人，吓坏了约翰逊，使得他不得不特别注意中国，不得不把中国作为美帝国主义的头号对手。
    准备武力进攻中国，这是约翰逊的一贯政策。但是，约翰逊也没有忘记另一手，这就是企图促使中国实行“和平演变”。
    约翰逊在他的咨文中，说什么“我们将继续希望大陆中国人民和世界大家庭之间实现和解”。
    什么是约翰逊所说的“世界大家庭”呢？这就是以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义、各国反动派三位一体的世界反革命阵营。
    约翰逊所说的“和解”又是什么意思呢？那就是指望隐蔽在我们国家内部的、像我们已经揪出来的那些赫鲁晓夫式的坏蛋，推行资本主义复辟，去投靠他们的反革命阵营。约翰逊所期望着的中国同“世界大家庭”之间的“和解”，也就是妄想中国有朝一日也像苏联那样发生“和平演变”，像苏修那样同美帝国主义相互勾结、狼狈为奸，去镇压世界革命人民。
    呸！约翰逊，你这是在白日作梦！
    在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指引下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，正在我们祖国的辽阔国土上展开的、风起云涌的无产阶级文化大革命运动，给了美国强盗头子约翰逊当头一棒，约翰逊“和平演变”的幻想，彻底破灭了。盘踞在我国一些阵地上的、大大小小赫鲁晓夫式的坏蛋，已经或正在被我们红卫兵，被广大的工农兵群众和革命人民，一个个地揪到光天化日之下，一个个地打倒。祖国的每一个阵地，必将为伟大的毛泽东思想彻底占领。我们有了极其光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想，有了毛主席亲自开辟的无产阶级文化大革命的道路，中国的第三代、第四代一定是鲜红鲜红的！中国的子孙万代也一定是红彤彤的！约翰逊希望中国“和世界大家庭之间实现和解”的阴谋，是永远不会得逞的！
    约翰逊还说什么，如果中国“把它的巨大力量和智慧集中用于改造它自己人民的福利，我们将首先鼓掌欢迎”。换句话说，约翰逊要中国人民只顾自己鼻子尖下的事，不要支持世界革命。
    我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”
    约翰逊十分害怕我们支持世界革命，那我们就更要高举世界革命的大旗，坚决支持全世界各国人民的革命斗争。我们红卫兵，毛主席的红小兵，就是要热烈响应党的八届十一中全会的伟大号召，始终不渝地支持全世界各国人民的革命斗争，以世界革命为己任，打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！打倒以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义！打倒一切反动派！
    约翰逊的国情咨文是一个地地道道的反革命宣言书，而苏联修正主义领导集团却如获至宝，把它发表在报刊上，还配了一张约翰逊满面笑容的照片，来为他吹捧。这也不奇怪，美帝、苏修本来就是一路货。
    毛主席说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”约翰逊之流当然也是不会自行灭亡的。他们总想用武力进攻和“和平演变”的两手，颠覆无产阶级专政的新中国，我们必须认真对付。我们红卫兵，中国无产阶级新的一代，要紧紧地跟着我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席，永远闹革命。不但闹中国的革命，而且闹世界的革命。我们将同世界革命人民一道，扫除一切害人虫！美帝也罢，苏修也罢，各国反动派也罢，将统统被革命的铁扫帚扫得干干净净！
    世界是属于人民的！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉必将照遍全世界！
