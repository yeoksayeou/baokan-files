The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam, in the past year, have displayed the invincible power of people's war, fought tenaciously, and achieved a glorious victory of annihilating 268,200 enemy troops. They have struck the most ferocious U.S. imperialism, making it panic-stricken and disheveled, turning the year 1966, when the U.S. imperialists made desperate struggles, into a year of heavy defeats in their aggression against Vietnam.

According to a war performance report recently issued by the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, as cited by the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, in the past year, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have fought nearly 40,000 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 268,200 enemy troops, including 108,000 U.S. aggressors and nearly 10,000 mercenaries. Compared with 1965, the number of U.S. troops annihilated in 1966 increased by more than four times. In addition, more than 100,000 puppet soldiers deserted in this year.

The report says that in the past year, the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam annihilated 47 enemy battalions, 306 companies, and 454 platoons, including 17 U.S. infantry battalions, 7 armored battalions, 79 companies, 62 platoons, and 10 companies of mercenaries. The total number of U.S. companies annihilated is more than five times that of 1965.

In 1966, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam also shot down and destroyed 2,130 enemy aircraft (1.5 times that of 1965), destroyed 3,300 vehicles of various types, sank 97 enemy ships, blew up 43 locomotives, 217 carriages, blew up 742 bridges, and captured or forced the enemy to withdraw from 4 military strongholds, 174 outposts, and 140 guard towers.

The report says that in the past year, the U.S. has increased its troops and war equipment, attempting to make up for quality with quantity, but it has failed. The more troops the enemy increases, the more are annihilated, and the situation is increasingly unfavorable to them.

After more than a year of fighting on the battlefield with the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys have exposed themselves as unable to cope with the Vietnamese people's armed forces, which have a clear and firm revolutionary ideal and an iron will to fight, as well as high combat skills and proficient tactical and technical levels.

The report says that the U.S. imperialists dream of world hegemony, but in the war of aggression against Vietnam, they have lost one-third to one-half of their annual defense budget. This is a question of great significance for the times: the most powerful imperialist country in the world, the United States, has already lost and is losing to a small nation.

The report says, "Our three armed forces are growing in number and improving in quality. The fighting spirit and combat effectiveness of the Liberation Armed Forces are continuously and steadily improving. The victories we achieved in 1966 are the victories of the high determination and will to decisive battle and victory of the Liberation Armed Forces in the South."

The report says that in this year, a prominent feature is that guerrilla warfare has significantly improved and developed in quality, organization, and activities. In many places, guerrilla forces have not only achieved victories in anti-"sweeping" operations but also, when dispersed, have attacked enemy-occupied areas.

The report says that 1966 was a year when the military and civilian people of South Vietnam continued to seize and develop the initiative on the battlefield, continuously and unceasingly striking the enemy everywhere. The military and civilian people of the South not only actively counterattacked the enemy in anti-"sweeping" operations but also penetrated into the enemy's lairs, attacking and annihilating them. They fought both the U.S. aggressors and the puppet army. The ever-changing tactics of the Liberation Armed Forces made the enemy panic-stricken and unable to cope. The line, strategy, and tactics of people's war have defeated and will thoroughly defeat the line, strategy, and tactics of the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression.

The report says that the victories of South Vietnam in military struggle, political struggle, and other aspects in the past year have formed a comprehensive and great victory.

The report says that at present, the position of the military and civilian people of South Vietnam is more consolidated, and their strength is greater.

The report points out that the victories of 1966 have special significance in the anti-U.S. and national salvation war of the people of South Vietnam. It has laid a solid foundation for the military and civilian people of South Vietnam to further achieve greater new victories.

    人民战争威力无穷　打得敌人焦头烂额
    南越军民奋战一年歼敌二十六万八千名
    歼灭美国侵略军十万八千名，比前年增加了四倍多  击落炸毁敌机两千一百多架，相当于前年的一倍半
    据新华社河内七日电　英雄的越南南方军民在过去一年里，发挥人民战争的无敌威力，进行了英勇不屈的战斗，取得了歼敌二十六万八千多名的辉煌胜利。他们把世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪，使美帝国主义进行疯狂挣扎的一九六六年，变成美帝国主义在侵越战争中遭到惨重失败的一年。
    据越南南方解放通讯社援引越南南方解放武装力量指挥部最近发表的一九六六年的战绩公报说，据不完全统计，在过去一年里，越南南方军民连续作战近四万次，共打死、打伤和俘虏敌人二十六万八千二百名，其中包括美国侵略军十万零八千名和帮凶军近一万名。同一九六五年相比，一九六六年被歼灭的美军总数增加了四倍多。此外在这一年里，还有十万多名伪军开了小差。
    公报说，在去年一年中，越南南方解放武装力量共歼灭敌军四十七个营、三百零六个连和四百五十四个排，其中包括美军十七个步兵营、七个装甲营、七十九个连、六十二个排和帮凶军十个连。被全歼的美军连的总数比一九六五年增加了五倍多。
    一九六六年南方军民还击落和炸毁敌机两千一百三十架（相当于一九六五年的一倍半），击毁各种军车三千三百辆，击沉敌人舰艇九十七艘，炸毁火车头四十三个、车厢二百一十七节，炸毁桥梁七百四十二座，攻克和迫使敌人撤出四个军事支区、一百七十四个据点和一百四十个岗楼。
    公报说，在过去一年里，美国加紧增兵，增加战争工具，妄图以数量来弥补质量，但是，它遭到了失败。敌人增兵越多，被消灭的也就越多，局势日益朝着不利于它们的方向发展。
    美国强盗及其走狗经过一年多来在战场上同越南南方军民的较量，已经赤裸裸地暴露出，它们是无法对付具有明确和坚定的革命理想和钢铁般的战斗意志，又有着极高的战斗本领和熟练的战术技术水平的越南南方人民武装。
    公报说，美国妄想称霸全世界，但是它只是在侵略越南的战争中，就失去了年度国防预算的三分之一到二分之一。这是一个具有时代意义的问题：帝国主义国家中最富强的头号帝国主义国家——美国，已经和正在输给一个小民族。
    公报说，“我们三种武装力量的数量日益发展，质量日益提高。解放武装力量的战斗精神和战斗力，不断稳步地提高。我们在一九六六年中取得的胜利，是南方解放武装力量高度的决心和决战决胜意志的胜利。”
    公报说，在这一年里，突出的一点是，游击战争在质量上、组织上和活动方面，都有了显著的提高和发展。许多地方的游击队，不但在反“扫荡”方面取得了胜利，而且还时而分散，时而集中，袭击敌占区。
    公报说，一九六六年，是越南南方军民继续掌握和发展战场上的主动权，连续和不断地到处打击敌人的一年。南方军民既在反“扫荡”中主动地反击敌人，又深入敌人的巢穴，进攻和歼灭它们。既打美国侵略军，又消灭伪军。解放武装力量千变万化的战术，使敌人惶惶不可终日，无法应付。人民战争的路线、战略和战术，已经打败和必将彻底打败美帝国主义的侵略战争的路线、战略和战术。
    公报说，越南南方在过去一年里在军事斗争、政治斗争和其它方面的胜利，形成了一个全面和巨大的胜利。
    公报说，目前，越南南方军民的地位更加巩固，力量更加强大。
    公报指出，一九六六年的胜利在越南南方人民的抗美救国战争中具有特别重要的意义。它为越南南方军民进一步夺取日益巨大的新胜利打下了稳固的基础。
