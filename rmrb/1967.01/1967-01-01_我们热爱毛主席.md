We saw Chairman Mao, and our hearts are filled with indescribable joy. We want to jump into his arms and never part! We saw Chairman Mao, and he gave us boundless strength. We love Chairman Mao the most; Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. We will read Chairman Mao's books and do what benefits the people. We love the people and strive to be good Red Guards. Chairman Mao is our red commander, and we are his little red soldiers. We will listen to Chairman Mao's words and become red successors of the revolution.
