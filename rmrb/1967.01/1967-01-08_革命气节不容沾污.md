For a revolutionary, the most important thing is to uphold revolutionary integrity. In any circumstance, one must never yield to the enemy. Upholding integrity and surrendering are the distinction between a revolutionary and a traitor. We will not allow anyone to blur this line.

The clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by Zhou Yang has long concealed themselves under the guise of Marxism-Leninism while engaging in anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities. They even extol the great traitor of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Li Xiucheng, as a "revolutionary hero," vigorously defending the traitor, placing him on stage, and into the historical museum, even intending to write his biography and erect a monument for him. Zhou Yang and his followers loudly proclaim the revisionist philosophy of traitors, even boasting, "Even if a Communist writes a confession and is killed, it does not make him a traitor." This is utterly shameless.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." We Communists and the army led by the Communist Party must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and never be subdued by the enemy. This is our revolutionary integrity, our fundamental revolutionary stance. We must protect it, more than we protect our lives!

How many of our revolutionary forebears, under the most difficult and painful conditions, have resolutely maintained their heroic revolutionary integrity. At the age of fifteen, Communist Party member Liu Hulan, to protect the Party's secrets, endured all kinds of torture from the enemy, and remained steadfast in her revolutionary integrity. Under the enemy's guillotine, she faced death unyielding, shouting "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and bravely met her end. She was truly "great in life, glorious in death." The Five Heroes of Mount Langya fought against the enemy on the steep cliffs for a whole day until their ammunition ran out. They thought: We must not yield to the enemy, we must not tarnish the honor of a revolutionary soldier. After throwing their last grenade, they shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and jumped off the cliff. In the prisons of the Kuomintang, whether in the Upsurge Concentration Camp or in Chongqing's Zazhou Cave, countless Communists and revolutionary soldiers endured all kinds of brutal torture from the enemy. They truly achieved fearlessness in danger and unyielding to death. They "walked the streets in chains, their spirits soaring;" "to spare the next generation from suffering, we are willing to sit out our prison terms." They set a brilliant example for revolutionaries, and we will march forward in their footsteps.

In the revolutionary ranks, there have also been a few traitors. They were cowardly and terrified in the face of the enemy's butcher's knife. They betrayed the cause and surrendered. These disgraceful traitors will forever be spat upon by us and future generations.

It has now been confirmed: Why does the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang so desperately defend the traitor Li Xiucheng? It turns out that among their ranks, there are some who, in the enemy's prisons, could not withstand the test and wrote confessions, shamefully surrendering to the enemy. Defending Li Xiucheng is defending themselves.

We must thoroughly expose the facts of Zhou Yang and his clique defending traitors and completely criticize and denounce their shameless philosophy of traitors!

    革命气节不容沾污
    解放军某部班长　董延孟
    对于一个革命者来说，最重要的就是要坚持革命的大节，在任何环境下，决不能向敌人屈服。坚持气节与屈服投降，这就是革命者与叛徒的区别。我们决不允许任何人混淆这条界限。
    周扬这一伙反革命修正主义分子，长期以来，披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，却干着反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的勾当。他们竟把太平天国革命的大叛徒李秀成吹捧成为“革命英雄”，竭力为叛徒辩护，把这个叛徒搬上舞台，摆进历史博物馆，还要为他立传树碑。周扬他们大肆宣扬修正主义的叛徒哲学，还叫嚣：“即使共产党人写过自白书被杀了，也不能叫做叛徒。”真是最无耻到极点了。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”我们的共产党人和共产党所领导的军队，就要遵照毛主席的指示，决不被敌人所屈服。这就是我们的革命大节，也就是最根本的革命立场。我们要保护它，比保护我们的生命还重要千万倍！
    我们多少革命先辈，就是在极艰难困苦的条件下，坚决保持了英勇的革命气节的。十五岁的共产党员刘胡兰，为了保住党的秘密，受尽敌人各种折磨，始终保持了共产党员的革命气节。在敌人的铡刀下面，她临死不屈，高喊“共产党万岁”！“毛主席万岁”！从容就义。她真是“生的伟大，死的光荣”。狼牙山五壮士在悬崖峭壁上和敌人浴血苦战了一天，最后子弹打完了。他们想的是：绝不能在敌人面前屈服，绝不能沾污革命战士的荣誉。他们在丢完了最后一颗手榴弹以后，高呼“毛主席万岁”！跳下了悬崖。在国民党的牢狱里，无论是在上饶集中营，或是重庆渣滓洞，多少共产党员，多少革命战士受尽了敌人的各种严刑酷打，他们真正做到临危不惧，宁死不屈。他们“带镣长街行，志气愈轩昂”；“为了免除下一代的苦难，我们愿把这牢底坐穿”。他们为革命者树立了光辉的榜样，我们将踏着他们的血迹，奋勇前进。
    在革命队伍中，也出现过少数叛徒。他们在敌人的屠刀面前贪生怕死，吓破了胆。他们变节了，投降了。这些可耻的叛徒，只能永远为我们以及将来的子子孙孙所唾弃。
    现在已经查明：周扬这一伙反革命修正主义分子，为什么这样拚命为叛徒李秀成辩护呢？原来在他们这一伙人之中，有一些人就是在敌人的牢狱中经不起考验，写过自白书，无耻降敌的叛徒。为李秀成辩护就是为他们自己辩护。
    我们一定要把周扬这一伙为叛徒辩护的事实揭穿揭透，一定要把他们这套无耻的叛徒哲学彻底批倒批臭！
