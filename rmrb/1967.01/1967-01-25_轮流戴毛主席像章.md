One day in Havana, a Chinese comrade encountered a Cuban worker on a bus. The worker was a black man, approximately in his thirties, and he had a shiny red Chairman Mao badge pinned to his chest.

Upon seeing that the Chinese comrade also had a Chairman Mao badge, the Cuban worker became particularly friendly and told the Chinese comrade that his badge had been given to him by a Chinese comrade some time ago. He had been wearing it ever since. He said, "But something unexpected happened. My wife once secretly took it away. She also wanted a Chairman Mao badge so much! I found out and immediately took it back. Not long after, my sister took it again. I just got it back from her. What can I do? All three of us want to wear it! Later, I promised to get two more badges from Chinese comrades for them."

The Cuban worker expressed to the Chinese comrade, "We love Chairman Mao. We wish him a long life, not just me, but all the Cuban people hope for this."

A Chinese comrade took off the Chairman Mao badge from his chest and gave it to him. After expressing his deep gratitude, he said, "Please convey my greetings to Chairman Mao and wish him good health."

　　轮流戴毛主席像章
    一天，在哈瓦那，中国同志在公共汽车上碰到一位古巴工人，是位黑人，看样子大约三十多岁，他的胸前别着一枚红光闪闪的毛主席像章。
    一看到中国同志也别着毛主席像章，这位古巴工人就特别亲热地告诉中国同志说，他的毛主席像章是前些时候一位中国同志赠送给他的，他一直别在胸前。他说：“但是，料想不到的事情发生了，我的妻子有一次私下把它拿走了，她也多么想自己有一枚毛主席像章啊！我发觉后立即要了回来。不久，我的妹妹又把它拿走了，我刚刚向她要回来。有什么办法呢？我们三个人都想戴着它！后来我答应一定为她们再向中国同志另外要两枚。”
    这位古巴工人向中国同志表示：“我们热爱毛主席，我们祝他老人家万寿无疆，不仅我这样想，古巴人民都这样希望。”
    一位中国同志把胸前别的毛主席像章取下来送给他，他在表示了深深的感谢之后说：“请你们向毛主席问好，祝他老人家身体健康。”
