In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as the entire nation enthusiastically responds to Comrade Lin Biao's call to take the "Three Articles" as our guiding principles, and as the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and to carry out ideological remolding sweeps the country, the memorial hall of the great communist warrior Zhang Sided opened in his hometown, Yilong County, Sichuan Province, on January 3.

The Zhang Sided Memorial Hall is housed in a solemn and unadorned red building. The plaque above the door reads "Serve the People" in five golden characters. On either side are quotations from Chairman Mao. The memorial hall is divided into three sections: Zhang Sided's youth, the Long March and Yan'an periods, and the achievements of the broad masses in learning and applying the "Three Articles" and taking Zhang Sided as an example. The hall displays 280 exhibits, including photographs and written materials, which vividly introduce the process by which the great communist warrior Zhang Sided grew up under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

Over 3,000 representatives from various sectors, including activists who study Chairman Mao's works, Zhang Sided's mother Liu Guangyou, Deng Fangzhi, the mother of Huang Jiguang, Zhang Sided's old comrades-in-arms, Red Guards, revolutionary students and teachers, workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadres, attended the opening ceremony.

A large portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hangs in the center of the stage. On either side of the stage are large banners with quotations from Chairman Mao's brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army led by our Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is a people's army. It is an army that is thoroughgoing in serving the people's interests. Zhang Sided is one of the comrades in this army." Another banner reads Chairman Mao's epitaph for Zhang Sided: "In memory of Comrade Zhang Sided, who sacrificed his life for the people."

A responsible comrade from the Yilong County Party Committee spoke on behalf of the county committee, the county people's committee, and the people of the entire county. He said, Zhang Sided was a great communist warrior who grew up under Chairman Mao's personal guidance. His life was a revolutionary life, a life of completely and thoroughly serving the people, leaving us with an extremely precious spiritual legacy. Through visiting this memorial hall, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the county will surely reach a new high. We must turn Zhang Sided's hometown into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Zhang's mother also spoke at the meeting. She said, Zhang Sided was a poor cowherd as a child. It was Chairman Mao who taught him the revolutionary principles of serving the people, and he became a good soldier of Chairman Mao. Zhang's mother encouraged everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and the "Three Articles" well, and to wholeheartedly serve the people.

Deng Fangzhi and Zhang Sided's old comrades-in-arms, as well as representatives from the Red Guards, workers, and peasants, spoke, saying that this memorial hall is an excellent classroom for learning and promoting Mao Zedong Thought. We must study diligently and bring back the precious things we learn here to spread throughout the country.

    学习和宣传毛泽东思想的好课堂
    张思德同志纪念室在仪陇开幕
    据新华社成都三日电  在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在全国人民热烈响应林彪同志号召，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，搞好思想革命化的群众运动中，伟大的共产主义战士张思德同志纪念室一日在烈士家乡四川省仪陇县开幕。
    张思德同志纪念室设在一座庄严朴素的红色平房内，门上的横额写着“为人民服务”五个金色大字。两旁还写着毛主席的有关语录。纪念室分三个部分：张思德的少年时代；长征和延安时代；广大群众活学活用“老三篇”，以张思德为榜样，所取得的光辉成就。纪念室陈列的二百八十多件实物、图片和文字材料，具体而生动地介绍了伟大的共产主义战士张思德，在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的过程。
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、张思德的妈妈刘光友，黄继光烈士的母亲邓芳芝，张思德同志的老战友，以及红卫兵、革命师生、工农兵和革命干部等各方面的代表三千多人参加了开幕式。
    会场主席台正中，悬挂着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像。主席台两侧的巨幅标语写着毛主席的光辉著作《为人民服务》中的一段语录：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。张思德同志就是我们这个队伍中的一个同志。”写着毛主席为张思德同志题的挽词：“向为人民利益而牺牲的张思德同志致敬”。
    中共仪陇县委负责人代表县委、县人民委员会和全县人民讲话。他说，张思德同志是在毛主席的亲切教导下成长起来的伟大的共产主义战士。他的一生，是革命的一生，是“完全”“彻底”、全心全意为人民服务的一生，给我们留下了极其宝贵的精神财富。通过参观这个纪念室，全县活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动必将掀起新的高潮。我们一定要把张思德的家乡办成毛泽东思想的大学校，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    张妈妈也在会上讲了话。她说，张思德从小是个放牛娃，穷孩子，是毛主席教导得好，让他懂得了为人民服务的革命道理，他才成了毛主席的好战士。张妈妈勉励大家，要好好学习毛主席著作，好好学习“老三篇”，要全心全意为人民办事情。
    黄妈妈和张思德的老战友、红卫兵、工农兵的代表在讲话中说，这个纪念室是我们学习和宣传毛泽东思想的很好的课堂。我们要好好学习，并且把这里学到的宝贵东西带回去，传遍全国。
