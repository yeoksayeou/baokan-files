Greek "Regeneration" Monthly recently published an article pointing out that the Soviet revisionist leadership's plot to convene a splitist conference is aimed at opposing Marxism-Leninism and striking at the struggles of oppressed nations and peoples, "serving the anti-communist, anti-people activities of U.S.-led imperialism."

The article states, "Revolutionary fighters, oppressed nations, and peoples around the world clearly understand that in the face of the new conspiracies of the revisionists, no matter how they disguise themselves, they must further strengthen their struggle, expose the capitulationist nature of modern revisionism, and deal a heavier blow to imperialism and its accomplices.

"This treacherous 'conference' will help draw a clear line between the true defenders of the people's cause and the false friends of the people, between genuine Marxist-Leninists and pseudo-Marxist-Leninists, and between genuine anti-imperialist fighters and fake anti-imperialists and the true running dogs of imperialism."

The article states, as has been repeatedly pointed out, convening such a treacherous revisionist 'conference' will be digging the grave for the people's enemy, the imperialist's accomplice—the revisionists.

　　希腊《再生》月刊谴责苏修为美帝反共反人民活动效劳
　　苏修召开分裂会议就是自掘坟墓
    新华社二十七日讯　希腊《再生》月刊最近发表文章指出，苏联修正主义领导集团策划召开的分裂会议，是为了反对马克思列宁主义，打击被压迫民族、被压迫人民的斗争，“替以美国为首的帝国主义的反共反人民活动效劳”。
    文章说，“全世界的革命战士、被压迫民族和人民很清楚，在修正主义者搞新的阴谋活动面前，不管他们如何伪装，都要进一步加强斗争，揭露现代修正主义的投降本质，给帝国主义及其合作者以更沉重的打击。
      “这一叛卖性的‘会议’将有助于在人民事业的真正捍卫者和人民的假朋友之间、在真马克思列宁主义者和假马克思列宁主义者之间、在真反帝战士和假反帝的人及帝国主义的真正走狗之间划清界限。”
    文章说，正如一再指出的那样，召开这样一个叛卖性的修正主义“会议”，将是为人民的死敌、帝国主义的帮凶——修正主义者挖掘坟墓。
