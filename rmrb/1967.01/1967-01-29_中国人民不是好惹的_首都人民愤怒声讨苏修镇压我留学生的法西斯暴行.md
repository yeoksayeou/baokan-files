The Chinese people are not to be messed with—Beijing residents angrily denounce the Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocities against our students abroad

These past few days, the weather has turned cold, and it even snowed the day before yesterday. “The plum blossoms rejoice in the falling snow, freezing a fly is nothing unusual.” In the midst of the falling snowflakes, the tide of the anti-revisionist struggle surged forward. The roar of protest echoed through the skies in front of the Soviet Embassy. Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses from Beijing braved the snow to strongly protest the savage beating of our students in Europe by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

From morning to night, the protest parade was endless. Revolutionary workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary cadres... wave after wave joined the struggle of protest. The loudspeakers on the Red Guard propaganda cars blasted out thunderous slogans like cannon fire: “Down with the Soviet revisionists!” “Down with Brezhnev!” “Down with Kosygin!” The walls of the Soviet Embassy and the walls along the anti-revisionist path were plastered with large banners: “The Chinese people are not to be insulted!” “Blood debts must be repaid with blood!” “Anti-China actions will not end well!”

The revolutionary workers of Beijing's rebel factions have been fighting economic tendencies day after day, winning victory after victory. They have seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and are now focusing on revolution and promoting production. When they heard the news of the Soviet revisionists' brutal beating of our students abroad, they were so angry their lungs nearly burst. Early in the morning, workers from the Beijing Steel Plant rushed straight to the anti-revisionist path after finishing their night shift to post protest big-character posters on the walls of the Soviet Embassy. Workers from the Beijing Municipal Residential Building Assembly Company angrily declared: “We will also use our actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production to counter the provocations of the Soviet revisionist bastards.”

All Chinese staff at the Soviet Embassy went on strike at 10 AM on the 27th to express their strongest protest against the Soviet revisionists. A boiler worker comrade said, Chairman Mao teaches us: “You should care about state affairs,” therefore, we cannot remain silent about the Soviet revisionists' savage beating of our students abroad. We should show the spirit of the working class, unafraid of the Soviet revisionists' threats and inducements. We resolutely refuse to work for them, let them do it themselves!

The Red Guard young warriors from various universities in the capital and revolutionary students from other provinces, these vanguards of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are also the pioneers of the international anti-revisionist struggle today. They came in waves, holding high the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, filled with intense hatred for the Soviet revisionists, to the Soviet Embassy to show the Soviet revisionist bastards that the Chinese Red Guards are not to be messed with, the Chinese people are not to be messed with. The revolutionary teachers and students from Beijing University, the birthplace of the first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster in the country, automatically held a demonstration march in the campus upon hearing the news that night. The next morning, they held a meeting. After the meeting ended, they divided into three groups to march and demonstrate, vowing to be the strong backbone of our students in Europe and to fight the Soviet revisionists to the end.

The queues of suburban farmers also arrived at the anti-revisionist path for demonstrations at night, expressing their immense anger and strongest protest.

The children from Dongsi Fifth Alley Kindergarten lined up to protest, raising their small fists and shouting slogans to “Down with the Soviet revisionists!” When asked why they want to overthrow the Soviet revisionists, the children answered well: “The Soviet revisionists are bad guys, bad guys are friends with bad guys, friends with imperialism, not with us, and they also beat us!”

Foreign friends full of revolutionary enthusiasm also joined the Beijing people in the protest demonstration. Two Albanian students held up a “Down with the Soviet revisionists” banner, saying: “We are truly furious.” A Cameroonian student's words sharply exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionists: “They have completely betrayed Marxism-Leninism and the anti-imperialist struggle. They beat revolutionaries and shake hands with counter-revolutionaries.” A Malayan friend angrily raised his fist and shouted: “Down with Soviet modern revisionism!”

Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and all the people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon for the people of the world to oppose imperialism and modern revisionism. You Soviet revisionist bastards, listen up: Whoever opposes our great leader Chairman Mao, we will smash their dog heads! You Soviet revisionist bastards, watch this: The more you oppose Mao Zedong Thought, the more we will propagate and defend Mao Zedong Thought. The more you fear the “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” the more we will hold them high, forming a vast red sea. The more you fear the voice of truth, the more we will read it aloud a thousand times and broadcast it a thousand times with loudspeakers:

Chairman Mao said: “The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, whether sooner or later, and will certainly achieve victory.”

The revolutionary young warriors of Beijing Anti-Japanese Military and Political University roared in anger in front of the Soviet Embassy: We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, we are the gravediggers of all reactionary forces. A red world will surely be born in the hands of the world's revolutionary rebels, and the future world will be a world of Mao Zedong Thought. The more the Soviet revisionists fear and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Part of the soldiers from the “Jinggangshan Corps” of Tsinghua University braved the snow and walked all the way from the school to the Soviet Embassy. Along the way, they sang songs from the “Quotations from Chairman Mao” and repeatedly read the highest directives. Upon arriving at the embassy, they waved the red “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” determined to use Mao Zedong Thought to fight down, fight stinky, and fight collapse the Soviet revisionist bastards, and to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country to the end, thoroughly uprooting the roots of revisionism.

Revolutionary youth from Indonesia, shrouded in white terror, and from Southeast Asia, upon hearing of the Soviet revisionists' savage atrocities against our students abroad, were extremely indignant. That night at 1:30 AM, they went to the Soviet Embassy to protest. The next day, they came here again to strongly protest the crimes of the Soviet revisionists. A returned overseas youth said correctly, the Soviet revisionists are so ferocious, which actually shows their weakness. They fear Mao Zedong Thought, fear the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China, fear that Mao Zedong Thought will arouse the Soviet people to rebel against them and seize their power!

From morning to night, the protest parade was endless. The protesters expressed their immense indignation and also their firm conviction. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique will surely be defeated, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will surely be victorious.

“Soviet revisionist masters, you wait! The blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will surely burn to your heads, this is the inevitable law of historical development, not subject to your will.”

“The glorious revolutionary tradition of the Soviet people will surely rise up to rebel against you!”

“We firmly believe that the Red Guards of Lenin's hometown will surely appear on the streets of Moscow. Your days are numbered!”

“The red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will surely fly high over Lenin's hometown and over the sky of the Kremlin!”

“Asking the plague lord where he is going, paper boats and candles illuminate the sky as they burn.” The protesters burned straw effigies symbolizing the Soviet revisionists and their leaders Brezhnev and Kosygin in front of the Soviet Embassy. For a moment, the flames roared, and the smoke billowed. Great! One day, in the revolutionary rebellion of the Soviet people, Soviet modern revisionism will surely turn to ashes, and a new Soviet Union, shining with the glory of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will surely be born!

　　中国人民不是好惹的
　　——首都人民愤怒声讨苏修镇压我留学生的法西斯暴行
    这两天，天气转寒，前天还下了雪。“梅花欢喜漫天雪，冻死苍蝇未足奇。”在雪花纷飞中，反修路上，示威队伍的洪流滚滚；苏联大使馆门前，愤怒的口号声响彻云霄。北京市成千成万的革命群众，冒雪前来，强烈抗议苏联修正主义统治集团野蛮殴打我国留欧学生的法西斯暴行。
    从早到晚，示威队伍浩浩荡荡。革命的工人、农民，红卫兵小将，革命师生，革命干部……一批又一批地投入了抗议斗争。红卫兵宣传车上的大喇叭，像排炮一样，猛烈轰击，播出震天动地的口号：“打倒苏修！”“打倒勃列日涅夫！”“打倒柯西金！”苏联大使馆的围墙上，反修路两旁的墙壁上，贴满了大标语：“中国人民不可侮！”“血债要用血来还！”“反华没有好下场！”
    首都造反派的工人们，连日来，在同经济主义的斗争中，打了一个又一个的胜仗。他们夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权，正在抓革命，促生产。他们听到苏修毒打我国留学生的消息，肺都要气炸了。清晨，北京钢厂的工人一下夜班就直奔反修路，把抗议的大字报贴到苏联大使馆的墙壁上。北京市住宅建筑装配公司的工人们气愤地表示：“我们还要用抓革命、促生产的实际行动，来反击苏修混蛋们的挑衅。”
    苏联大使馆的全体中国工作人员，二十七日上午十时举行罢工，表示对苏修最最强烈的抗议。一位司炉工人同志说毛主席教导我们：你们要关心国家大事，因此，我们对苏修野蛮殴打我国留学生的法西斯暴行，不能不闻不问。我们应该拿出工人阶级的硬骨头精神，不怕苏修对我工作人员的威胁利诱。我们坚决不给他们烧火，让他们自己去干吧！
    首都各院校的红卫兵小将和外地革命师生，这些无产阶级文化大革命中的先锋，今天又是国际反修斗争中的闯将。他们一批接着一批，高举着我们伟大领袖毛主席的画像，满怀着对苏修的强烈仇恨，来到了苏联大使馆门前，要让苏修混蛋们看一看，中国红卫兵不是好惹的，中国人民不是好惹的。全国第一张马列主义大字报的诞生地——北京大学的革命师生一听到消息，当晚就在校园内自动游行示威。第二天一早他们又开了大会。大会结束，他们就分兵三路，游行示威，誓当我国留欧学生的坚强后盾，同苏修斗争到底。
    郊区农民的队伍，也在夜间陆续来到反修路示威游行，表示他们无比的愤怒和最最强烈的抗议。
    东四五条幼儿园的孩子们，排了队前来示威，举起小拳头，高呼“打倒苏修”的口号。当人们问孩子们为什么要打倒苏修？孩子们答得好：“苏修是坏蛋，坏蛋跟坏蛋好，跟帝国主义好，跟我们不好，还要打我们！”
    满怀革命热情的外国朋友们，也同北京人民在一起，参加了抗议示威。两位阿尔巴尼亚学生举着“打倒苏修”的旗子，他们说：“我们真是气愤极了”。一位喀麦隆留学生的话，尖锐地揭穿了苏修的嘴脸：“他们完全背叛了马列主义和反帝斗争的事业。他们见了革命者就打，见了反革命者就拉手。”一位马来亚朋友愤怒地举起拳头高呼：“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”
    毛主席是中国人民和全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳。毛泽东思想是全世界人民反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的最强大的思想武器。苏修混蛋们，你们听着：谁要反对我们的伟大领袖毛主席，我们就要砸烂谁的狗头！苏修混蛋们，你们瞧着：你们越是反对毛泽东思想，我们越是要宣传毛泽东思想，捍卫毛泽东思想。你们越是害怕《毛主席语录》，我们越是要把《毛主席语录》高高举起，汇成红色的海洋。你们越是害怕真理的声音，我们越是要千万遍高声朗读，越是要千万遍用大喇叭播送：
    毛主席说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    北京抗大电校的革命小将们，在苏联大使馆门前发出震天的怒吼：我们是毛主席的红小兵，我们是一切反动势力的掘墓人。红彤彤的世界必将在我们世界革命造反者的手中诞生，未来的世界是毛泽东思想的世界。苏联修正主义者越是害怕和反对毛泽东思想，我们就一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。
    清华“井冈山兵团”的一部分战士，冒雪从学校一直步行到苏联大使馆门前。一路上，他们高唱毛主席语录歌，不断朗读着最高指示。到大使馆门前，他们挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，表示坚决要用毛泽东思想把苏修混蛋们斗倒、斗臭、斗垮，并且把我国的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子。
    来自笼罩着白色恐怖的印度尼西亚和来自东南亚的归侨革命青年，听到苏修镇压我留学生的野蛮暴行，万分气愤。当夜一点半就到苏联大使馆门前示威。第二天他们又一次来到这里，对苏修的罪行提出最最强烈的抗议。一位归侨青年说得对，苏联修正主义这样穷凶极恶，实际上是他们虚弱的表现。他们害怕毛泽东思想，害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命，害怕毛泽东思想唤起苏联人民起来造他们的反，夺他们的权！
    从早到晚，示威队伍，浩浩荡荡。示威的人们，表示了无比的愤慨，也表示了坚强的信心。苏联修正主义统治集团必败，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想必胜。
      “苏修老爷们，你们等着！无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，必将烧到你们头上，这是历史发展的必然规律，决不以你们的意志为转移。”
      “有光荣革命传统的苏联人民，一定会起来造你们的反！”
      “我们坚信，列宁故乡的红卫兵，一定会出现在莫斯科街头。你们的末日就要到了！”
    “毛泽东思想的红旗必将高高飘扬在列宁的故乡，飘扬在克里姆林宫上空！”
    “借问瘟君欲何往，纸船明烛照天烧。”示威群众在苏联大使馆门前，焚烧了象征苏修及其头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金一伙的稻草人。一时烈火熊熊，浓烟阵阵。好啊！总有一天，在苏联人民革命造反的烈火中，苏联现代修正主义必将化为灰烬，一个马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想光辉普照的红彤彤的新苏联必将诞生！
