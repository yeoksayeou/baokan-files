The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on January 16 handed a note to the Indian Embassy in China, detailing the numerous instances of Indian incursions into Chinese territory and airspace along the China-India and China-Sikkim borders in 1966, and lodging a strong protest with the Indian government.

The note stated that in 1966, Indian troops crossed the actual line of control on the China-India border and the China-Sikkim border to invade Chinese territory 73 times, and Indian aircraft violated Chinese airspace 71 times.

In the western sector of the China-India border, Indian forces frequently invaded the ground in the Wenchuan area of Xinjiang. In the second half of last year alone, there were 24 such incursions, with some lasting five to six hours.

In the eastern sector of the China-India border, in addition to maintaining their aggressive fortifications at Jialin Public Square, Indian forces invaded the Xiao area north of the actual line of control 12 times.

On the China-Sikkim border, Indian forces invaded Chinese territory through the Naihela Pass 13 times between May and December last year, and repaired the barbed wire left behind when Indian forces retreated from there in September 1965. Indian forces also repeatedly carried out provocative activities at the Naihela Pass, even opening fire on Chinese sentries. At the Dagang Pass, invading Indian forces threatened local Chinese herders; in the Donglang grasslands, Indian forces set fire to a Chinese herder's cow shed.

The note pointed out that the above situations indicate that the Indian side is still creating tension and attempting to provoke border incidents. The Indian government has recently issued multiple notes accusing China of "invasion" to cover up its own true invasion activities. However, the facts are clear, and the Indian government's attempt to confuse the issue by reversing black and white is the most foolish thing to do.

The note finally sternly pointed out that the Indian government's continued use of the China-India border issue to oppose China is merely an attempt to curry favor with the imperialists and revisionists and find a way out of its domestic and international predicaments. However, over the past year, the Indian government's situation has not improved but has become even more infamous internationally and has sparked stronger opposition from its people at home. If the Indian government persists in its anti-China stance and continues to provoke and invade along the border, creating tension, it will only dig itself deeper into a dead end. As the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, pointed out: "Beginning with the intention to harm others, ending with harm to oneself. This will be the development law of all reactionary policies." The Indian government's anti-China policy will not escape this law.

    我外交部强烈抗议印度方面去年不断入侵我领土领空
    印政府讨好帝修拚命反华只能害己
    新华社十七日讯　中华人民共和国外交部一月十六日把一份照会交给印度驻华大使馆，详细列举印度方面在一九六六年内在中印边界和中国—锡金边界频繁地侵犯中国领土和领空的严重入侵挑衅事件，向印度政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会说，一九六六年内，印度军队越过中印边界实际控制线和中国—锡金边界侵犯中国领土达七十三起，印度飞机侵犯中国领空达七十一架次。
    在中印边界西段，印方对新疆温泉一个地区的地面入侵活动，仅去年下半年，就达二十四起，入侵时间有时达五、六个小时。
    在中印边界东段，印军除仍在呷林公台地保持侵略工事外，仅对双方实际控制线以北的肖一个地区，入侵就达十二起。
    在中锡边界，印军在去年五月至十二月的八个月中，越过乃堆拉山口侵入中国境内侦察骚扰共达十三起，并且修复了一九六五年九月印军从那里撤逃时遗留的铁丝网。印军还一再在乃堆拉山口进行各种挑衅活动，甚至向中国哨兵开枪。在达吉山口，入侵印军对当地的中国牧民进行恫吓；在洞朗草场，印军纵火焚毁了中国牧民的牛棚一所。
    照会指出，以上情况表明，印方仍在制造紧张局势，企图挑起边境事件。印度政府最近却多次来照，反诬中国“入侵”，来替印方自己真正的入侵活动打掩护。但是，事实俱在，印度政府妄想用颠倒黑白的手法混淆视听，自以为得计，其实是最愚蠢不过的。
    照会最后严正指出，印度政府继续利用中印边界问题进行反华，无非是想讨好帝修，寻找一条摆脱国内外困境的出路。但是，一年来，印度政府的处境不仅没有改善，反而在国际上更加声名狼藉，在国内激起人民更强烈的反对。如果印度政府仍无悔改之心，坚持反华，继续在边境对中国入侵挑衅，制造紧张局势，那就只能在死胡同里越陷越深。正如中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席所指出：“以损人的目的开始，以害己的结果告终。这将是一切反动政策的发展规律。”印度政府的反华政策是绝对逃不脱这条规律的。
