Revolutionaries from all over the world say: In today's world, one must firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. This is because Mao Zedong Thought is the "highest and most living Marxism-Leninism of our times," it is the "peak of truth," it is the "highest, creative, systematic, and scientific development of Marxism-Leninism." It "reflects the laws of international class struggle," it "reflects the fundamental interests of the international proletariat and working people." It "scientifically summarizes and concentrates the international historical experience of the proletarian revolution," it is the "crystallization of the world proletarian revolutionary experience." The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon, in its decision on "Promoting the Study of Mao Zedong Thought," pointed out that "Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when world imperialism is heading towards final collapse and world revolution is heading towards victory." Journalists from Laos praise Mao Zedong Thought as the "most thorough and steadfast revolutionary thought," as the "sole correct thought guiding all revolutions and construction," as the "highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

Revolutionaries from all over the world say: This is because Mao Zedong Thought is the "most precious and richest spiritual wealth" of the revolutionary people of the world. It will give people boundless wisdom and strength. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Brazil enthusiastically praises Mao Zedong Thought as "an inexhaustible source of teachings, a source of strength inspiring people to fight against the most vicious U.S. imperialism." Revolutionaries from many countries praise Mao Zedong Thought as the "weapon that transforms people's souls," as the "weapon that promotes the revolutionization of the masses." With it, one can "dare to climb the mountain of knives for the revolution, forever young and strong in struggle"; with it, one can "sweep away darkness," "dispel the fog and see the light."

Revolutionaries from all over the world say: This is because Mao Zedong Thought is the "sharp sword in the hands of the people of the world to cut down the imperialist devil," it is the "precious blade to chop off the head of modern revisionism," it is the "hammer to smash the exploitative system to pieces," it is the "unresistible spiritual atomic bomb." A writer from Malaya and a freedom fighter from Angola both point out that this powerful spiritual weapon can thoroughly, completely, and entirely annihilate imperialism and modern revisionism.

A friend from Burma says: "Mao Zedong Thought has deeply rooted itself in the hearts of the anti-imperialist people of various countries, in the hearts of workers who smash capitalist society, in the hearts of laboring people who oppose oppression and exploitation." Revolutionary people from many countries speak with admiration: "Chairman Mao seems to have been here, his works have touched our hearts, tightly grasped our hearts!" A friend from Mali believes that Mao Zedong Thought has already "become the soul of the revolution of the oppressed people of all countries in the world."

    毛泽东思想是革命人民的灵魂
    世界各国革命者说：在当今的世界上，必须大立毛泽东思想，这是因为毛泽东思想是“当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义”，是“登峰造极的真理”，是“马克思列宁主义的高度的、创造性的、系统的和科学的发展”；它“反映了国际阶级斗争的规律”，“反映了国际无产阶级和劳动人民的根本利益”；它“科学地总结和集中了无产阶级革命的国际历史经验”，是“世界无产阶级革命经验的结晶”。锡兰共产党中央委员会在关于“促进毛泽东思想的学习”的决定中指出，“毛泽东思想是世界帝国主义走向最后崩溃，世界革命走向胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。”老挝新闻界人士颂扬毛泽东思想是“最彻底最坚定的革命思想”，“是指导一切革命和建设的唯一正确的思想，是当代马克思列宁主义的最高顶峰”。
    世界各国革命者说：这是因为毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的“最宝贵和最丰富的精神财富”，它会使人们产生无穷的智慧和力量。巴西共产党中央委员会热烈赞扬毛泽东思想“是取之不尽的教益的源泉，是鼓舞人们反对人类最凶恶的美帝国主义的力量的源泉”。许多国家的革命者称颂毛泽东思想是改造人们灵魂的武器”，是“促进群众革命化的武器”。有了它，就能“为革命刀山敢上，永葆青春斗争强”；有了它，就能“扫黑暗”，“驱散云雾见光芒”。
    世界各国革命者说：这是因为毛泽东思想是世界人民“手中斩除帝国主义魔鬼的利剑”，是“砍掉现代修正主义脑袋的宝刀”，是“把剥削制度砸得粉碎的气锤”，是“不可抵御的精神原子弹”。马来亚的一位作家和安哥拉的一位自由战士都指出，这种强大的精神武器，能够彻底地、全面地、完全地消灭帝国主义和现代修正主义。
    缅甸一位朋友说：“毛泽东思想深深扎根在各国反帝人民的心中，扎根在粉碎资本主义社会的工人的心中，扎根在反对压迫和剥削的劳动人民的心中。”许多国家的革命人民都带着敬佩的口吻说：“毛主席好像到过我们这里，他的著作，说到了我们的心里，紧紧抓住了我们的心！”马里的朋友认为，毛泽东思想已经“成为世界各国被压迫人民革命的灵魂”。
