South Yemen's armed struggle against British imperialist colonial rule has achieved significant victories in the past year. In the battles, South Yemen's nationalist fighters have applied Chairman Mao's great military thoughts on guerrilla warfare, maneuvering flexibly to annihilate the enemy. They are growing stronger with each battle, striking fear into the hearts of the British colonialists. The victories of the South Yemen people once again prove that Chairman Mao's brilliant assertion that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers is an unshakable truth.

A military leader of the National Liberation Front of occupied South Yemen told a Xinhua News Agency reporter: "In our battles, Chairman Mao's great strategic thoughts on guerrilla warfare have played a significant role. We are now using Chairman Mao's thoughts to deploy our battles. Many of our guerrilla fighters love to read Chairman Mao's books. Over the past year, despite the British colonial forces' strict searches and mad sweeps, we have achieved great victories with the support of the South Yemen people." He said: "By the end of last November, the South Yemen guerrilla forces had carried out 1,279 attacks and explosions on British military camps, armories, airports, and other targets, killing 533 British soldiers and wounding 287. These victories have disrupted the enemy's plans, making the British colonial forces demoralized and terrified."

The South Yemen nationalist fighters began their armed struggle in the Radfan mountains in mid-October 1963. Reports indicate that the armed struggle has now spread across the entire South Yemen, with battles raging in more than ten war zones. Over the past year, the South Yemen nationalist fighters, with their brave, determined, and flexible combat, have dealt heavy blows to British imperialism. A fighter from the Radfan region, Ahmed Gallab Shaf, told the reporter: "We have a deep hatred for the colonialists. We are not afraid to die, and we have the firm belief that we will win." He used his personal experience in a battle to illustrate how imperialist invaders can be defeated by a people's armed forces that dare to fight and are good at fighting. He said, in one night, 36 nationalist fighters, armed with four small cannons and four light machine guns, attacked a British colonial military outpost. They first sent three scouts to gather information about the enemy. Then, in less than two hours of battle, we annihilated all the enemies in the outpost, captured nine people, and seized some weapons.

A fighter from the Yafa region, Ali Mahassen, proudly told the reporter: "In battle, fighters all have this belief: the enemy is not to be feared. We only have one thought, that is, either victory or our territory will be occupied. So we fight very bravely."

He said, one night, the British colonial forces attacked a mountain held by nationalist fighters. The enemy conducted indiscriminate bombing, and the battle lasted from six in the evening until seven in the morning the next day. The fighters fought bravely and tenaciously, inflicting heavy losses on the invading enemy.

After the battle, the enemy left piles of corpses, while the nationalist fighters remained steadfastly guarding the high mountain.

    拿起枪杆子，打倒殖民者
    南也门人民武装一年来战斗千余次毙伤英军八百多人
    据新华社萨那电　南也门人民为反对英帝国主义殖民统治而进行的武装斗争，在过去一年中取得了重大的胜利。在战斗中，南也门民族主义战士运用了毛主席关于游击战争的伟大军事思想，机动灵活地消灭敌人。他们越战越强，打得英国殖民主义者坐立不安。南也门人民所取得的胜利，又一次证明了毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的英明论断是一个颠扑不破的真理。
    被占领的南也门解放阵线的一位军事负责人对新华社记者说：“在我们的战斗中，毛主席关于游击战争的伟大战略思想起了很大的指导作用，现在我们正运用毛主席的这个思想来部署我们的战斗。我们的许多游击队员都非常喜欢读毛主席的书。一年来，尽管英国殖民军严密地搜查和疯狂地扫荡，我们在南也门人民的配合下，取得了很大的胜利。”他说：“到去年十一月底为止，南也门游击队对英国军营、军火库、机场等袭击和爆炸达一千二百七十九次，打死英军五百三十三人，打伤二百八十七人。这些胜利打乱了敌人的部署，使英国殖民军士气低落，胆战心惊。”
    南也门民族主义战士是一九六三年十月中在拉德凡山区开始武装斗争的。据报道，目前武装斗争已经遍及南也门全境，在十多个战区里进行。去年以来，南也门民族主义战士以勇敢坚定、机动灵活的战斗，给了英帝国主义以沉重的打击。一位来自拉德凡地区的战士艾哈迈德·加利卜·谢夫对记者说：“对于殖民主义者，我们有强烈的恨。我们不怕死，有坚决战胜的信心。”他用自己亲身经历的一次战斗说明帝国主义侵略军是可以被敢于斗争、善于斗争的人民武装力量打败的。他说，在一个晚上，三十六名民族主义战士带着四门小炮和四挺轻机枪去袭击英国殖民军的一个据点。他们先派三个侦察员摸清了敌人的情况。随后在不到两个小时的战斗中，我们就把据点内的敌人全部歼灭，活捉九个人，缴获了一些武器。
    来自雅法地区的一位战士阿里·马哈森对记者豪迈地说：“在战斗中，战士们都有这样一个信念：敌人不可怕。我们只有一个想法，那就是，要么胜利，要么我们的领土被占领。所以我们打仗都非常勇敢。”
    他说，有一天夜里，英国殖民军进犯由民族主义战士守卫着的一个山头。敌人进行狂轰滥炸，战斗从晚上六点一直打到第二天早晨七点。战士们打得英勇顽强，痛击进犯的敌人。
    战斗结束后，敌人留下了一堆堆的尸体，而民族主义战士们依然坚强地驻守在这座高山上。
