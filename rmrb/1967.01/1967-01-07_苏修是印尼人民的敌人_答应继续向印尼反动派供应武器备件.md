The Soviet revisionist leadership clique continues to supply weapons and spare parts to the Indonesian military, which has already slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Indonesian people. This fully exposes the traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionists.

According to a report from Jakarta, it was announced on the 3rd that a delegation led by Suprajoyo, an "adviser" to the Indonesian "Cabinet," reached an agreement in Moscow with the Soviet government to continue supplying weapons and spare parts to the Indonesian military. This delegation was headed by Buwono, a member of the "Cabinet Presidium" of the right-wing military regime in Indonesia.

    据新华社五日讯　雅加达消息：苏联现代修正主义领导集团，继续向已经杀害了几十万印度尼西亚人民的刽子手印尼军队提供武器备件。这充分暴露了苏联现代修正主义者的叛徒面目。
    据印尼右派军人政权“内阁主席团”成员布沃诺的秘书三日宣布，这是以印尼“内阁顾问”苏普拉约基为首的一个代表团，在莫斯科同苏联政府达成的协议。
