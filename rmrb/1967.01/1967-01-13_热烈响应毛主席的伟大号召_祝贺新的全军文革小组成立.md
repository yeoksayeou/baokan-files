Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao has personally decided to broadcast nationwide the "Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and the "Emergency Announcement" issued by various revolutionary rebel groups in Shanghai. This event of great significance has pushed our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into a new stage.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, in their congratulatory telegram to the revolutionary rebel groups in Shanghai, call on all parties, government, military, and civilian sectors nationwide, and call on all workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres nationwide, to learn from the experience of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, to act in unison, to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advance victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of our army enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call and resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebels. We must thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line, defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Our army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the defender of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is even more important to the army and should be carried out more thoroughly.

To strengthen the leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire army, with the approval of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central Military Commission has decided to reorganize the army's Cultural Revolution Group and establish a new army Cultural Revolution Group to work under the direct leadership of the Central Military Commission and the Central Cultural Revolution Group.

We warmly endorse the reorganization of the army Cultural Revolution Group and congratulate the establishment of the new army Cultural Revolution Group.

The reorganization of the army Cultural Revolution Group is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and encouragement for our entire army. Under the leadership of the new army Cultural Revolution Group, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our army will surely present a new face and achieve greater victories.

Let us high hold the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, warmly and firmly support the revolutionary leftists, develop and strengthen the leftist forces, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, and launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the military and the few stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line. We must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminate the pernicious influence of this reactionary line in the military, push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our army to a new stage, and do a better job in all aspects.

    热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召
    祝贺新的全军文革小组成立
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，亲自决定向全国广播上海市各革命造反团体发表的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》。这个具有伟大意义的事件，把我国无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新的阶段。
    中共中央、国务院、中央军委和中央文化革命小组，在给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电中，号召全国的党、政、军、民各界，号召全国的工人、农民、革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部，学习上海市革命造反派的经验，一致行动起来，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，使无产阶级文化大革命沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
    我军广大指战员，最热烈地响应毛主席的伟大号召，最坚决地支持革命造反派的革命行动。我们一定要彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们的军队是无产阶级专政的支柱，是无产阶级文化大革命的保卫者。因此，无产阶级文化大革命，对军队来说，就更加重要，更应该搞彻底。
    为了加强全军无产阶级文化大革命的领导，经毛主席和中共中央批准，中央军委决定改组全军文化革命小组，成立新的全军文化革命小组，在中央军委和中央文化革命小组的直接领导下进行工作。
    我们热烈拥护全军文化革命小组的改组，祝贺新的全军文化革命小组的成立。
    全军文化革命小组的改组，是毛主席对我们全军的最大关怀，最大鼓舞。在新的全军文化革命小组的领导下，我军的无产阶级文化大革命，必将出现一个新的面貌，获得更大的胜利。
    让我们高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，热情地坚定地支持革命左派，发展壮大左派队伍，团结广大革命群众，向军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，猛烈开火。我们一定要彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清这条反动路线在军队的恶劣影响，把我军的无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新阶段，把各方面的工作做得更好。
                                              （一月十二日）
