Once, in the waiting room of Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai, after the airport's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team had finished singing the Quotations Song, a friend from Guinea immediately stood up, adjusted his clothes, and pressed his French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" tightly to his chest. Facing the giant full-body statue of Chairman Mao, he recited in a loud voice a quotation from Chairman Mao: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." Then, he shared his insights on studying this quotation: "The people are the driving force behind the progress of history and the creators of world history. The fate of the world is not determined by cannons or bombs, but by the people. As long as we, the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world, unite, we will definitely be able to overthrow American imperialism and all reactionaries."

　　背语录　谈体会
    有一次，在上海虹桥机场候机室里，当机场的毛泽东思想宣传队刚唱完语录歌后，一位几内亚朋友马上站起身来，理了理衣服，把法文版的《毛主席语录》紧紧地贴在胸前，面对着毛主席的巨大的全身塑像，用宏亮的声音背诵了毛主席的语录：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”接着，他畅谈自己学习这段语录的体会说：“人民是推动历史前进的动力，是创造世界历史的动力。决定世界命运的不是大炮，不是炸弹，而是人民。只要我们亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及世界上一切革命人民团结起来，我们就一定能打倒美帝国主义和一切反动派。”
