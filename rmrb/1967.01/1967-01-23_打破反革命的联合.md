	Break the Counter-Revolutionary Alliance

	Chairman Mao said: "The current global situation is one where the two great forces of revolution and counter-revolution are engaged in their final struggle."

	On one side, there is the great alliance of the revolutionary people of the world. They are launching an irresistible attack against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries.

	On the other side, there is the alliance of counter-revolutionary forces worldwide. They are making a desperate and frenzied counterattack against the revolutionary people.

	China, with its 700 million people guided by Mao Zedong Thought, is the center of the great alliance of the revolutionary people of the world. American imperialism, on the other hand, is the ringleader of the worldwide counter-revolutionary alliance.

	In this global class struggle, anyone who opposes China will inevitably align with American imperialism. Anyone who aligns with American imperialism will inevitably fall into the anti-China quagmire, becoming a tool of American imperialism's anti-China agenda.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, while outwardly advocating "united action," is actually engaged in criminal collusion with American imperialism and its lackeys. They aim to form a new "holy alliance" that is anti-communist, anti-people, anti-revolutionary, and anti-China.

	This counter-revolutionary alliance does not indicate their strength but rather exposes their inherent weakness. No matter how much they collude and depend on each other, they cannot escape their ultimate doom.

	The great alliance of the revolutionary people of the world is an unbreakable fortress. As Chairman Mao said: "It is something that no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolution cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolution."

　　打破反革命的联合
    毛主席说：“现在世界上的局面，是革命和反革命两大势力作最后斗争的局面。”
    一面是全世界革命人民的大联合。他们正向着美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派发起势不可挡的进攻。
    一面是全世界反革命势力的联合。他们正在对革命人民进行疯狂的绝望的反扑。
    毛泽东思想指导下的七亿人民的中国，是全世界革命人民大联合的中心。美帝国主义则是全世界反革命联合的总头目。
    在这场全球阶级大搏斗中，谁要反对中国，谁就必然要联合美帝国主义。谁要联合美帝国主义，谁就必然滑到反华的泥坑中去，充当美帝国主义的反华工具。
    苏联修正主义领导集团，表面上打着“联合行动”的幌子，实际上却干着勾结美帝国主义及其走狗的罪恶勾当，企图同它们“结成一个反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的新神圣同盟”。
    这种反革命的联合，并不表明它们的强大，恰恰暴露了它们本身的虚弱。不管它们怎样互相勾结，互相依赖，它们也逃脱不了最后灭亡的命运。
    全世界革命人民的大联合，是真正的铜墙铁壁。正如毛主席所说的：这是“什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”
