The friendly delegation led by Secretary-General Sannanayaka of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers, after visiting Pakistan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Mali, returned to Beijing this evening.

The delegation was welcomed at the airport by Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Asian and African writers and revolutionary fighters residing in Beijing.

Also present at the airport to welcome the delegation were members of the Executive Secretariat of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers, headed by Acting Secretary-General Ibrahim Issa, as well as staff members of the Chinese Liaison Committee for the Asian and African Writers Conference.

Members of the delegation who returned to Beijing with Secretary-General Sannanayaka include Wafi (Sudan) and Wang Li (China).

During their visits to the aforementioned countries, the delegation received warm welcomes from the peoples of those nations and were received by some of the heads of state and officials, which strengthened mutual understanding and combat friendship, and promoted the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist cause of Asian and African writers and peoples. During the visit, the delegation also expounded on the correct revolutionary line led by Secretary-General Sannanayaka of the Permanent Bureau of Asian and African Writers, strongly condemning the fake "Third Congress" preparatory meeting in Cairo, meticulously planned by the Soviet revisionists to disrupt and split the Asian and African writers' movement, and the attempted illegal convening of the fake "Third Congress" in Beirut. This has made new contributions to the unity of Asian and African writers in the anti-imperialist struggle, dealing a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.
