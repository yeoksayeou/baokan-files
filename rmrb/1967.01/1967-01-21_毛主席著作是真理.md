Chairman Mao's works are the truth. Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary leader of our time. Chairman Mao's works provide an inexhaustible source of strength for the struggle of the peoples of the world, especially the international proletariat.

The Chinese people sing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" every day, and this is not by chance. Chairman Mao is indeed the best helmsman. The heavy responsibility that Chairman Mao bears is one that no one else can shoulder. It is he who steers the ship to safety through stormy seas.

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the highest stage of Marxism-Leninism in our time. Mao Zedong is undoubtedly the most outstanding teacher of the international proletariat.

Chairman Mao's works are the truth. They not only illuminate the path forward for the Chinese people but also enrich Marxism immeasurably. Mao Zedong's predictions about the world situation in various circumstances have all come true.

　　毛主席著作是真理
    毛主席是当代最伟大的革命领袖，毛主席著作给世界各国人民特别是国际无产阶级的斗争提供了无穷无尽的力量源泉。
    中国人民天天唱《大海航行靠舵手》，这不是偶然的。毛主席的确是最好的舵手。毛主席所担负的重大责任，是别人担负不了的。正是他，在大风大浪中把航船导向安全的海岸。
    伟大的毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高阶段。毛泽东当之无愧地是国际无产阶级最杰出的导师。
    毛主席著作是真理，它不但照亮了中国人民前进的道路，还不可估量地丰富了马克思主义。毛泽东在各种情况下对世界局势的预言都实现了。
