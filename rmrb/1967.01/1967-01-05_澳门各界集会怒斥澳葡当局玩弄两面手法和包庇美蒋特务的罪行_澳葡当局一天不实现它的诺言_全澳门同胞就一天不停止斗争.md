Macao's workers, peasants, students, and representatives from various social groups have continued to hold rallies and discussion meetings in recent days to condemn the Portuguese authorities' duplicity and evasive tactics regarding China's legitimate demands and the rights of Macao residents. They also exposed the Portuguese authorities' long-standing protection of American Kuomintang spies.

At these meetings, representatives from various sectors read excerpts from Chairman Mao's works: "We must never relax our vigilance against the revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs, no matter how great our victories. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be disarmed politically and fall into a passive position."

Participants at the rallies resolutely declared: As long as the Portuguese authorities do not fulfill their promises, the people of Macao will not stop their struggle. The people of Macao will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the Portuguese authorities' plots, and force them to immediately ban the Kuomintang bandit organizations in Macao and prohibit any activities by American Kuomintang spies.

Participants at the rallies cited numerous facts to expose and condemn the Portuguese authorities' long-standing tolerance and protection of American Kuomintang spies' rampant behavior in Macao, and their persecution of Macao residents. Many workers pointed out that over the past decade, the "Labor Union Federation," a Kuomintang spy organization, has committed countless crimes. During a movie screening held by tricycle workers to raise welfare funds, this spy organization attacked the event, injuring several workers, with one worker suffering severe abdominal injuries, causing his intestines to protrude.

Farmers from the Ma Cam area indignantly exposed the American Kuomintang spies' brutal persecution of farmers over the past seventeen years. In early 1952, a henchman of the American Kuomintang spies beat up a farmer. The farmers strongly denounced the spies' atrocities. The Portuguese police then colluded with the American Kuomintang spies to arrest two farmers. The next day, a Kuomintang spy led over 180 thugs, armed with guns and knives, to ambush a Portuguese sports club. They then sent more than ten thugs to the streets to chase and beat farmers, attempting to lure out the crowd for a massacre. This plot was foiled by the farmers.

In early 1953, farmers in the Ma Cam area decided to organize and establish a farmers' cooperative. Kuomintang spies threatened farmers and declared that anyone attending the meeting would be killed. Soon, a farmer who attended the meeting was severely beaten. Another farmer was beaten into a coma by Kuomintang spies in 1957. When another farmer took the culprit to the Portuguese police station, he was also beaten by the Portuguese police.

Many workers and farmers angrily declared that they would not allow the Portuguese authorities to continue colluding with American Kuomintang spies to wreak havoc. They must drive the Kuomintang spies out of Macao. They sternly warned the Portuguese authorities that they must immediately and fully implement all the conditions proposed by China and the people of Macao; otherwise, the Portuguese authorities will reap what they sow.

    澳门各界集会怒斥澳葡当局玩弄两面手法和包庇美蒋特务的罪行
    澳葡当局一天不实现它的诺言  全澳门同胞就一天不停止斗争
    据新华社香港四日电　澳门各业工人、农民、学生和其他社会团体的群众，连日来继续举行反迫害斗争大会和座谈会，愤怒谴责澳葡当局对我国方面和澳门同胞的正义要求玩弄两面手法，采取拖延耍赖的恶劣态度，揭露澳葡当局一贯包庇美蒋特务的罪行。
    在这些会上，各业群众朗读了毛主席语录：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”
    参加集会的人们坚决表示：澳葡当局一天不实现它的诺言，全澳门同胞就一天不停止斗争。全澳门同胞要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底粉碎澳葡当局的阴谋诡计，迫使澳葡当局立即取缔在澳门的蒋匪帮机构，禁止美蒋特务在澳门的任何活动。
    参加集会的人们举出大量事实，揭露和控诉澳葡当局一贯纵容包庇美蒋特务在澳门横行霸道，迫害澳门同胞。许多工人指出，十多年来，美蒋特务机构“工团总会”分子就干下了数不尽的坏事。三轮车工人一次为筹募福利金举行的电影晚会，就受到这个特务机构“工团总会”的袭击，有多名工人被毒打受伤，一名工人腹部受重伤以至肠脏流出腹外。
    马场区的菜农义愤填膺地揭露了美蒋特务十七年来残酷迫害农民的罪行。一九五二年初，一个美蒋特务的爪牙打伤了一名菜农，菜农们严厉声讨美蒋特务的暴行。澳葡警察便勾结美蒋特务逮捕了两名农民。就在第二天，一个美蒋特务分子带领打手一百八十多名，携带枪械、利刃埋伏在一间葡萄牙人的体育会馆内，然后派出十多名打手到街上追打农民，企图诱出群众，进行屠杀，这一阴谋被菜农们识破才未得逞。
    一九五三年初，马场区的菜农决心组织起来，成立菜农合群社。美蒋特务分子四出恐吓农民，并叫嚣不准开会，谁参加集会就杀谁。不久，一位农民参加了集会就被他们毒打受重伤，还有一位菜农在一九五七年被美蒋特务毒打得神志昏迷，另一位菜农把这个凶手押到澳葡警署时，又遭到了澳葡警察的围殴。
    许多工人、农民愤怒地说，我们决不容许澳葡当局与美蒋特务再互相勾结在一起，横行霸道，一定要把美蒋特务赶出澳门去。他们严重警告澳葡当局，必须立即全面、彻底实现我国方面和澳门同胞提出的各项条件，否则，澳葡当局必将自食其果。
