Vietnamese Chargé d'Affaires Le Cong Chi held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists today. He strongly condemned the recent U.S. imperialist bombings of cities and villages in North Vietnam and the savage massacre of civilians in the Ben Cat area of South Vietnam's Tuyen Duc Province.

Le Cong Chi stated that the U.S. imperialists' mad "escalation" of the war is an attempt to reverse their heavy losses suffered in their aggression against Vietnam in 1966. This criminal act once again exposes the deceptive nature of the U.S. imperialists' so-called "peace" rhetoric at the beginning of this year.

Le Cong Chi pointed out that no matter how savage the methods used by the U.S. imperialists, they will not shake the Vietnamese people's ironclad resolve to resist U.S. aggression and save the nation. The Vietnamese people will fight even more resolutely to annihilate the U.S. imperialists and bring their just cause to complete victory.

Chargé d'Affaires Le Cong Chi stated that the U.S. imperialists must immediately stop their war of aggression against Vietnam, cease their bombings, strafing, and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and withdraw all U.S. and puppet troops from South Vietnam. Two statements issued by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on January 22 were also distributed at the press conference.

　　越驻华使馆临时代办黎终始举行中外记者招待会
　　强烈谴责美帝疯狂的“战争升级”罪行
    新华社二十四日讯　越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办黎终始在今天举行的中外记者招待会上，强烈谴责美帝国主义最近连续轰炸越南北方的城市、乡村，野蛮屠杀越南南方土龙木省边蓄地区居民的滔天罪行。
    黎终始说，美帝国主义这种疯狂的“战争升级”行动，是为了挽救它们在一九六六年内，在侵略越南战争中所遭到的惨重失败。这一罪恶行动再一次揭露了美帝国主义，在今年年初重新叫嚷的“和平”论调的欺骗实质。
    黎终始指出，美帝国主义任何野蛮的手段也动摇不了越南人民抗美救国的钢铁般的决心。越南人民将更坚决地为消灭美帝国主义而战斗，把自己正义的事业推向全胜。
    黎终始临时代办表示，美帝国主义必须立即停止侵略越南的战争，停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸、扫射和其他一切战争行动，把美国军队和仆从国军队，从越南南方全部撤走。在记者招待会上还散发了越南民主共和国外交部发言人一月二十二日的两个声明。
