The revolutionary rebels in the publishing system have risen up and seized the publishing power from the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the publishing industry! The revolutionary rebels have completely taken control of the power to publish Chairman Mao's works! Revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres are all overjoyed! This is a great and joyous event! This is a signal that the brilliant and great Mao Zedong Thought will be even more widely spread!

We, the broad masses of revolutionary rebels, love Chairman Mao's books more than anything else. We can go without food, we can go without sleep, but we cannot go a day without reading Chairman Mao's books! For a long time, the handful of scoundrels who controlled the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the publishing industry used all kinds of tricks to limit and suppress the publication of revolutionary treasures—Chairman Mao's works. Instead, they shamelessly spread a large amount of poisonous weeds, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, sounding the gong to open the way, and their intentions are extremely malicious! Recently exposed, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are still, within their reach, continuing to wave the "red flag" against the red flag, continuing to play the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick, transferring the power of the proletariat from one bourgeois hand to another. They are utterly despicable and deserve to be executed a thousand times over! Now is the time for us revolutionary rebels to settle accounts with them! If not now, when? The living facts have taught us that, above all, seizing power is the most important! Can we revolutionary rebels let them continue to wreak havoc? No, absolutely not! We must seize all the publishing power and all other powers they control and make their wild dreams completely shattered!

Chairman Mao teaches us: To overthrow a government, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this. The publishing department is a department that creates public opinion. Who controls this department is a big deal. The world is ours. The country is ours. The society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will? We revolutionary rebels must firmly grasp the power of the publishing department and make it a stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. We revolutionary rebels will resolutely respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee, unite as one, and bravely shoulder the glorious mission of publishing Chairman Mao's works given to us by the Party and the people. With the fastest speed and the best quality, we will excellently complete this great task. The hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country will, with hearts full of excitement, obtain the most precious gift and learn and master Mao Zedong Thought even earlier and better, thus contributing endless power to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

　　出版毛主席著作的大权我们掌
　　本报评论员
    出版系统的革命造反派起来造反了，起来从旧中宣部、旧文化部和出版界一小撮反革命修正主义分子手里夺过出版大权了！革命造反派完全掌握毛主席著作的出版权了！革命的工人、革命的农民、革命的学生、革命的干部无不欢欣鼓舞！这是一件大快人心的大好事！这是光辉伟大的毛泽东思想更加广泛传播的信号！
    我们广大的革命造反派最最热爱毛主席的书，我们饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，但一天不读毛主席的书不行！长期以来把持旧中宣部、旧文化部和出版界大权的一小撮混帐家伙，使尽种种阴谋诡计，限制压缩出版革命的宝书——毛主席著作，却肆无忌惮地散布大量毒草，为资本主义复辟制造舆论，鸣锣开道，用心何其毒也！新近揭露的一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，仍然在他们力所能及的范围内继续打着“红旗”反红旗，继续玩弄反革命两面手法，把无产阶级的大权从一个资产阶级手里换到另一个资产阶级手里。他们混帐透顶，罪该千刀万剐！现在是我们革命造反派向他们算总账的时候了！此时不算，更待何时？！活生生的事实教育了我们，千重要，万重要，夺权最重要！我们革命造反派能让他们继续胡作非为吗？不能，绝不能！我们要把他们所控制的出版权和一切权力统统地夺过来！使他们的痴心妄想彻底破灭！
    毛主席教导我们：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。出版部门就是一个制造舆论的部门。这个部门掌握在什么人手里，是一件大事。天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？我们革命造反派一定要牢牢地掌握出版部门的大权，使它成为宣传毛泽东思想的牢固阵地。我们革命造反派将坚决响应党中央的伟大号召，团结一致，勇敢地担负起党和人民所给予的出版毛主席著作的光荣使命，以最快的速度，最好的质量，圆满出色地超额完成这一伟大的任务。全国亿万革命群众将怀着万分激动的心情，获得最宝贵的礼物，更早更好地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，为中国革命和世界革命发挥无穷无尽的力量！
