Macau compatriots resolve to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought and fight to the end. The Portuguese authorities in Macau must promptly give a satisfactory reply to our demands.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hong Kong on the 23rd, over a hundred representatives from various circles in Macau held a meeting on the evening of the 21st. They strongly condemned the Portuguese authorities in Macau for continuing to adopt a despicable attitude of procrastination, deceit, and refusal to admit guilt towards the six demands of the Macau compatriots. The meeting issued a serious warning to the Portuguese authorities: if they persist in their errors, the Macau compatriots will take action and give them a severe punishment.

Liang Pei, the director of the Macau Federation of Trade Unions, said at the meeting that the recent "reply" submitted by the Portuguese "governor" Silva to the representatives of various circles in Macau still plays tricks, evades the main issues, and procrastinates. The Portuguese authorities have played tricks with the translation of the "reply," using different versions in Chinese and Portuguese to attempt to evade responsibility for the "December 3" massacre and even defame the compatriots who suffered as "criminals." Liang Pei warned Silva: the people of Macau have already proposed many measures for sanctions, and Silva must comply and give a satisfactory reply to the just demands of the Macau compatriots.

The representatives at the meeting expressed their extreme indignation and stated that they would not tolerate the despicable attitude of the Portuguese authorities. They pointed out that since the Portuguese authorities announced on December 12th and 13th last year that they "fully accept" the four conditions proposed by the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office and the six demands of the people of Macau, more than a month has passed, but they have not yet provided a satisfactory reply, and their attitude has become even more despicable. The people of Macau are extremely indignant and have proposed specific measures to sanction the Portuguese authorities. If the Portuguese authorities do not provide a satisfactory reply within the shortest possible time, we will immediately take action to impose sanctions, and all consequences will be the full responsibility of the Portuguese authorities.

The representatives emphasized that the people of Macau are fully prepared and fear no sacrifices. They will definitely follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight to the end with the Portuguese authorities.

The meeting established a sanctions committee consisting of 17 people, including workers, peasants, businessmen, students, women, teachers, medical personnel, and journalists, to be responsible for proposing measures and methods to sanction Portuguese imperialism and to quickly formulate an action plan.

In recent days, the Macau Federation of Trade Unions, the Federation of Students, the Federation of Women, the Federation of Youth, and many trade unions and mass organizations have held meetings to fight against oppression.

　　澳门同胞决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗斗争到底
　　澳葡当局必须对我要求迅速作出圆满答复
    据新华社香港二十三日电　澳门各界同胞代表一百多人二十一日晚举行集会，强烈谴责澳葡当局对澳门同胞的六项要求继续采取拖延狡赖、出尔反尔、不肯低头认罪的恶劣态度。会议严重警告澳葡当局：如果仍然执迷不悟，澳门同胞就要行动起来，给予严厉惩罚。
    澳门工会联合总会理事长梁培在会上说，澳葡“总督”嘉乐庇最近向澳门各界代表提交的“答复书”，仍然玩弄两面手法，避重就轻，拖延狡赖。澳葡当局在“答复书”的译文上大耍花招，中文一套，葡文一套，妄图洗脱“一二·三”大屠杀的罪责，甚至污蔑我受害同胞是“犯罪”。梁培正告嘉乐庇：全澳同胞已经提出了许多制裁办法，嘉乐庇必须规规矩矩，对澳门同胞的正义要求迅速作出令人满意的答复。
    各界代表在会上感到无比愤怒，表示绝不能容忍澳葡当局的恶劣态度。他们严正指出，澳葡当局从去年十二月十二日和十三日晚在电台宣布“全部接受”广东省外事处处长提出的四项条件和全澳同胞提出的六项要求后，至今已一个多月，不但仍未交出圆满的答复书，而且态度更为恶劣，全澳同胞极为愤怒，人们已提出制裁澳葡当局的具体办法，如果澳葡当局不在最短期间内有圆满的答复，我们就要立即采取制裁行动，一切后果应由澳葡当局负完全责任。
    代表们强调指出，澳门同胞已作好一切准备，不怕任何牺牲，一定遵循毛主席的教导，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同澳葡当局斗争到底。
    会议通过了由工人、农民、商人、学生、妇女、教师、医务人员和新闻工作者等十七人组成的制裁小组，专门负责提出制裁澳葡帝国主义的措施和办法，并尽快提出行动方案。
    连日来，澳门工联、学联、妇联、青联和许多工会和群众组织举行了反迫害斗争集会。
