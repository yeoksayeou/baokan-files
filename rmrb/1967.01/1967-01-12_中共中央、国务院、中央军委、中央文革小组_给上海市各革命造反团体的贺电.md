Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 31 other revolutionary mass organizations:

Your "Urgent Announcement" issued on January 9, 1967, is excellent. The guidelines you have proposed and the actions you have taken are completely correct.

You have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. You are models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

You have firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. You have timely exposed and thwarted the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and have launched a powerful counterattack.

You have upheld proletarian dictatorship and upheld the socialist direction, and have put forward the fighting task of opposing the revisionist and economistic counter-revolutionary line.

You have formulated correct policies based on Chairman Mao's guideline of "grasp revolution, promote production."

You have implemented the great alliance of revolutionary mass organizations and have become the core of uniting all revolutionary forces, firmly grasping in your hands the destiny of proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy.

Your series of revolutionary actions have set a brilliant example for the working class and the laboring people of the whole country, for all revolutionary masses.

We call upon all parties, governments, military, and civilians of the country, and call upon all workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres of the country to learn from the experience of the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, to take united action, to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advance victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

    上海工人革命造反总司令部等三十二个革命群众组织：
    你们在一九六七年一月九日发出的《紧急通告》，好得很。你们提出的方针和采取的行动，是完全正确的。
    你们高举了毛泽东思想伟大红旗。你们是活学活用毛主席著作的模范。
    你们坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线方面。你们及时地识破了和揭穿了资产阶级反动路线新反扑的阴谋，举行了有力的还击。
    你们坚持了无产阶级专政，坚持了社会主义的大方向，提出了反对反革命修正主义的经济主义的战斗任务。
    你们根据毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，制定了正确政策。
    你们实行了无产阶级革命派组织的大联合，成为团结一切革命力量的核心，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里。
    你们这一系列的革命行动，为全国工人阶级和劳动人民，为一切革命群众，树立了光辉的榜样。
    我们号召全国的党、政、军、民各界，号召全国的工人、农民、革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部，学习上海市革命造反派的经验，一致行动起来，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，使无产阶级文化大革命，沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
