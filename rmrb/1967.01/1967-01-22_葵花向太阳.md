Sunflowers Face the Sun

Using a Great Name to Name the Young Pioneers

More than six hundred Congolese (Brazzaville) youths in the capital of Equateur Province, Brazzaville, have organized and formed a Young Pioneer Corps. Among them, a corps of two hundred people, out of their love for the great Chairman Mao, named their corps the "Mao Zedong Young Pioneers."

Definitely Want to See the Great Chairman Mao

The news that the large-scale Chinese color documentary "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army" is being shown in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, reached the students of Benadir Middle School. The students eagerly wanted to see this film. This school was a gift from the Soviet Union to Somalia, with the majority of the teachers being Soviet citizens, including a deputy principal who was also a Soviet. When the students requested to see the film and agreed on a time, the Soviet teachers unreasonably obstructed them, even pressuring the students and threatening to withdraw the teachers. However, the more than two hundred male and female students in the school, despite the obstruction and threats from the Soviet teachers, still organized themselves and went to the Chinese Embassy to see the film. On their way back to school in the dead of night, they continuously shouted in Chinese the slogans they had just learned from the film: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Captured the Most Beautiful Scenes in the World

Not long ago, at Beijing Airport, a Japanese friend was returning home from Beijing by plane. As he walked out of the terminal building, he saw a large portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the front of the building. This Japanese friend, without waiting for the people seeing him off to say goodbye, and without caring that the plane was about to take off, ran straight to Chairman Mao's portrait to take a photo. As he turned to board the plane, he saw a huge red sun rising in the east, radiating golden light and shining brightly. The Japanese friend hurriedly pointed his camera at this magnificent scene and took a photo of the "East is Red." Later, the Japanese friend happily said, "I captured the two most beautiful scenes in the world."

Seeing Chairman Mao's Portrait and Reciting Chairman Mao's Quotations

One day, a Sudanese employee received a copy of the Chinese "Beijing Weekly." His friends, upon seeing it, all wanted to be the first to see it. After a discussion, everyone agreed to first open the first page of the weekly to see Chairman Mao's portrait together, and then read the quotations from Chairman Mao on the weekly. Everyone saw that Chairman Mao was in good health and felt very happy. Then, everyone recited Chairman Mao's quotations while eagerly looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao in the publication.

　　葵花向太阳
    用伟大的名字为少先队命名
    刚果（布）赤道省省会卢寨堡的六百多名刚果（布）少年已经组织起来，成立了少年先锋队。其中有一个二百人组成的一个少年先锋队，出于对伟大的毛主席的热爱，把他们的队命名为“毛泽东少先队”。
      一定要看看伟大的毛主席
    中国大型彩色纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》在索马里首都摩加迪沙放映的消息传到了贝纳迪尔中学，学生们都急切地要看这部电影。这所中学是苏联“赠与”索马里的，苏联教师占绝大多数，有一个副校长也是苏联人。当学生们提出要看这部影片，并约好了时间之后，苏联教师竟然无理阻挠，甚至向学生施加压力，并以撤走教师进行威胁。但是学校的二百多名男女学生不顾苏联教师的阻挠和威胁，仍然组织起来，赶到中国大使馆去看这部影片。他们在深夜返校途中，一路上不断地用中文高呼刚从这部影片里学到的口号：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    摄到了世界上最美好的镜头
    不久前，在北京机场，一位日本朋友从北京乘飞机回国，当他走出候机大楼时，发现大楼正面悬挂着一幅毛主席巨幅油画像。这位日本朋友顾不上送行的人向他告别，也顾不上飞机将要起飞，一直跑到毛主席像前拍摄了毛主席的照片。当他转身将要上飞机的时候，看到东方升起一轮巨大的红日，金光四射，光芒万丈，这位日本朋友又急忙把镜头对准这一派壮丽的景色，照了一个“东方红”。过后，这位日本朋友高兴地说，“我拍到了世界上最美好的两个镜头”。
    看毛主席像背毛主席语录
    有一天，一位苏丹职员收到了一本中国《北京周报》，他的朋友看到后，都争着要先睹为快。经过一番讨论后，大家同意先打开周报的第一页，一起看看毛主席像，然后朗读了周报上的毛主席语录。大家看到毛主席身体很健康，都感到很高兴。接着，大家一面背诵毛主席语录，一面抢着看刊物上的毛主席像。
