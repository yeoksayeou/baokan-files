Activists of the Japan-China Friendship Movement Resolve to Achieve New Victories in 1967
Distinguish True Friends from False Friends and Promote Japan-China Friendship
A Few People Opposing Japan-China Friendship Will Only End Up Hurting Themselves

	BEIJING, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) - TOKYO, Jan. 21 - The General Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) held a banquet on the 21st in Tokyo. Over 500 activists involved in the Japan-China friendship movement gathered to resolve to achieve new victories in 1967.

	Vice Chairman Ito Takeo spoke at the meeting. He said, "We must face the light, summon more courage, and strive for the genuine Japan-China friendship movement by opposing U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism." Liaozhengzhi Office Chief Representative in Tokyo, Sun Pinghua, was invited to attend the banquet and gave a speech. He said, "Last year's struggle helped us distinguish true friends from false friends. A few people opposing Japan-China friendship have isolated themselves and ended up hurting themselves. He pointed out that the situation this year is better than last year. As long as the peoples of China and Japan strengthen their unity and fight bravely, this year will surely be a year of greater victories."

	Japanese youth vying to go to Beijing to participate in the Second Japan-China Youth Friendship Grand Rally took the stage wearing red armbands of the Chinese Red Guards. They highly praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and extended warm greetings to the Chinese Red Guards.
