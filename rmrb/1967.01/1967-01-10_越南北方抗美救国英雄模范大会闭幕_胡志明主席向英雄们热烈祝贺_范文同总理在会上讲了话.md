He said, "The anti-American national salvation struggle of our people is the center of the current struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism. This great cause is pushing the revolutionary heroism of our people to its peak. Revolutionary heroism is an invincible spiritual and material force, fully embodied in the people's war of national salvation against American aggression. Our people possess this force, and no matter how much the American aggressors intensify and expand the war, we will definitely defeat them completely."
