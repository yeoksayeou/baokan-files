Under the great red banner of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, unite!

The glorious Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebel army, united with the proletarian revolutionary factions, has struck a fierce blow against the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and pushed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, to a new stage, advancing swiftly and irresistibly. They have set a brilliant example for us, and their extremely precious revolutionary experience is worth our careful study.

In the telegram of congratulations sent by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the thirty-two revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, it is pointed out: "You have implemented the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions, becoming the core of uniting all revolutionary forces, firmly grasping in your own hands the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy." This is a high evaluation of the revolutionary actions of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary factions, and it is also a great call to us, who firmly stand on Chairman Mao's side, to be revolutionary rebels. From the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply feel that only by seriously implementing the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions can we truly stand on Chairman Mao's side, truly grasp the destiny of the Party and the state, and make our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advance victoriously along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao.

Looking back to last June, when our great leader Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism from Beijing University nationwide, it ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, greatly inspiring us, the revolutionary rebels of Zhonggang. We rose up in rebellion! However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Zhonggang Company, along with a few stubborn individuals who persistently adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, spared no effort to create trouble and suppress the revolutionary mass movement. They used their Party power to deceive, mislead, and suppress a large number of cadres and Party members. Anyone who opposed them was labeled as an "anti-Party element" or a "rightist." These extremely stubborn individuals also used some of the masses, who were temporarily deceived by them, and their deep feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao, to organize so-called workers' patrol teams to protect themselves and implement bourgeois dictatorship over the revolutionary masses, trying every means to undermine revolutionary organizations. From last August to October, in just a few dozen days, they used various vile and poisonous methods to slaughter, and only four or five of the more than forty revolutionary mass organizations that had sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain remained. They also used their economic power to carry out economic persecution or economic bribery, attempting to suppress the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated by Chairman Mao, and achieve their evil goal of destroying the Cultural Revolution. Even more despicable, they used the pretext of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" to suppress the revolutionary masses, not allowing the proletarian revolutionary factions to rise up in rebellion.

Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we saw through their tricks, exposed their schemes, and they again used economic benefits and material incentives as bait, attempting to lead this serious political struggle onto the path of economism, destroying the revolution and production. Especially recently, they have been even more rampant in playing new tricks of the bourgeois reactionary line, desperately resisting the proletarian revolutionary factions from seizing their power. In recent days, they have continuously handed over power from offices and workshops to production lines, from logistics systems to transportation departments to their puppet tool—the workers' patrol teams. This is completely their attempt to challenge the revolutionary factions for power, a farce of inciting the masses to fight the masses, and a sham seizure to protect their power. How malicious their intentions are!

We, the steel workers, are red rebels. We listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Our love for Chairman Mao is redder than molten steel. We vow to defend Chairman Mao's will with an iron will and a steel-like resolve. Under the brilliant guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we raise the banner of revolutionary rebellion high. No matter how much white terror a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn individuals who persistently adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line implement, whether they use soft and hard tactics or sugar-coated bullets... they cannot scare us or crush us. We will resolutely rebel and rebel to the end!

We, the revolutionary rebels of Zhonggang, will resolutely take the Shanghai revolutionary rebels as our example, implement the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions, and achieve great unity in struggle. We will seize the Party power, state power, and economic power from the hands of the class enemies and firmly grasp them in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions. We will most resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," counterattacking all the new counterattacks of the class enemies, and will not rest until we overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and thoroughly smash the rampant counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Most beloved Chairman Mao, we, the steel workers, promise you: we will be both the vanguard of the revolution and the pioneers of production, and we will surely achieve double victories in revolution and production.

　　在毛主席革命路线的伟大红旗下联合起来
　　重钢红色造反兵团春雷造反队
    光荣的上海工人革命造反大军，联合无产阶级革命派，迎头痛击资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺了权，把毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命推向了新的阶段，势如破竹地向前猛进。他们为我们树立了光辉榜样，他们提供的极其宝贵的革命经验，值得我们好好学习。
    中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市三十二个革命造反团体的贺电中指出：“你们实行了无产阶级革命派组织的大联合，成为团结一切革命力量的核心，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里。”这是对上海无产阶级革命派的革命行动的崇高评价，也是对我们坚决站在毛主席一边的革命造反派的伟大号召。我们从伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中深切地体会到，只有认真实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，才能真正站在毛主席一边，真正掌握党和国家的命运，使我们的无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席革命路线胜利前进。
    回顾去年六月份我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定广播北京大学的全国第一张马列主义的大字报，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，极大地鼓舞了我们重钢革命造反派，我们起来造反了！但是重钢公司的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，挖空心思，制造事端，竭力压制革命的群众运动。他们利用在握的党权，欺骗、蒙蔽、压制大批的干部和党团员，谁反对他们，就把谁打成“反党分子”、“右派”。这些极端顽固的家伙还利用一些暂时受他们蒙蔽的群众对党和毛主席的深厚感情，组织所谓工人纠察队，保护他们自己，对革命群众实行资产阶级专政，千方百计瓦解革命组织。仅从去年八月到十月的几十天中，他们使用各种卑劣毒辣的手段，大砍大杀，就使雨后春笋般出现的四十多个革命群众组织扼杀得只剩下四、五个了。他们还利用手里的财权，实行经济迫害或经济收买，妄图把毛主席发动的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命打下去，以达到他们破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的。更为卑劣的是，他们还假“抓革命，促生产”之名，行“以生产压革命”之实，只准他们镇压革命群众，不准无产阶级革命派起来革命造反。
    在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，我们识破了他们的阴谋，戳穿了他们的鬼把戏，他们又以经济福利、物质刺激为诱饵，妄图把这场严肃的政治斗争引向经济主义的斜路上去，破坏革命，破坏生产。特别是最近，他们更为猖獗的玩弄资产阶级反动路线的新阴谋，拚命抵制无产阶级革命派起来夺他们的权。连日来，他们不断地把从机关处室到生产车间，从后勤系统到运输部门的大权拱手交给他们的御用工具——工人纠察队。这完全是他们与无产阶级革命派挑战争权，是他们一手导演的继续挑动群众斗群众，实行假夺真保的丑剧，用心何其毒也！
    我们钢铁工人是红色的造反者，我们最听毛主席的话，我们热爱毛主席的心比钢水更红，我们誓死保卫毛主席的意志比铁硬比钢坚，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的光辉照耀下，高举革命造反的大旗，不管一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，实行白色恐怖也罢，软硬兼施也罢，糖衣炮弹也罢……都吓不倒我们，压不垮我们，我们坚决造反，一反到底！
    我们重钢的革命造反派，坚决以上海革命造反派为榜样，实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，战斗的大团结，把无产阶级的党权、政权、财权从阶级敌人手中夺回来，牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。我们最坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，回击阶级敌人的一切新反扑，不斗倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不彻底打垮资产阶级反动路线的猖狂反扑，死不瞑目！
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊，我们钢铁工人向您保证：既做革命的先锋，也做生产的闯将，誓夺革命生产双胜利。
