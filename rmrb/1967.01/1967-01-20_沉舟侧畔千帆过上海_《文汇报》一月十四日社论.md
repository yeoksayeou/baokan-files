In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, a new phenomenon has emerged: revolutionary rebel factions in many units have seized power. This is a sign of the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and it is also a sign of the impending doom of the bourgeois reactionary line. The cultural revolution in the Shanghai region has entered a new stage.

Revolution is about one class overthrowing another. The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. Revolution is about seizing power. At this critical moment when the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, socialism and capitalism are in a decisive battle, and when the bourgeoisie is launching a ferocious attack on proletarian dictatorship, we must stand up and firmly and without hesitation seize the leadership of proletarian dictatorship, the leadership of the cultural revolution, the leadership of newspapers and all propaganda tools, and the leadership of the economic lifeline from the hands of those bourgeois gentlemen.

Conciliationism? No way!
Reformism? No way!
Sentimentalism? No way!
The world is ours; the country is ours; society is ours. If we don't speak, who will? If we don't act, who will?

Only by firmly grasping the leadership in their own hands can the revolutionary rebels truly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Some people advise us not to leave them (referring to those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road), saying that without them, we will have a hard time. Let such advice be damned! They think we can't do without them, but we don't believe that.

Practice has proven that when those big and small bourgeois elements fall, our days do not become difficult; on the contrary, they become better and better, more and more prosperous.

Without them, we will only live better. Because that bunch of people includes those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line. Once they are overthrown, the revolutionary rebels stand up, and the cultural revolution will surely usher in a thriving new situation.

Chairman Mao has always taught us that the people have boundless creativity. We firmly support the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary rebels. We firmly believe that once the revolutionary rebels seize power, as long as they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize the masses, unite all the masses who support the revolutionary rebels, and gradually establish a new order, they will surely be able to grasp the revolution and promote production. The revolutionary rebels are not afraid of pressure, not afraid of attacks, not afraid of blows; how can they be afraid of not being able to shoulder the responsibility after seizing power? Those who believe that without them, it won't work, besides not daring to rebel themselves, also do not allow others to rebel. This is the attitude of the pseudo-foreigner in "The True Story of Ah Q." In the cultural revolution that has already been deeply carried out today, these new pseudo-foreigners can rest!

One after another, those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line have fallen, and batch after batch of resolute revolutionary rebels have seized power. These are all good things, all inspiring good news!

The revolutionary rebels will learn to fight, learn to seize power, and learn to exercise power in the struggle. They may make this or that mistake due to lack of experience, but that is not a big deal. As long as they strive to master Mao Zedong Thought, are good at uniting the majority in the struggle, summarize experience in a timely manner, correct mistakes, and persist in the struggle, the final victory will surely belong to the revolutionary rebels.

"The sinking boat is passed by a thousand sails, and in front of the withered tree, ten thousand flowers bloom." The end of a handful of bourgeois gentlemen has come, let us applaud and cheer!

    沉舟侧畔千帆过上海
    《文汇报》一月十四日社论
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，又涌现出了一个新事物：许多单位内的革命造反派起来夺了权。这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得伟大胜利的一个标志，也是资产阶级反动路线面临死亡的一个标志。上海地区的文化大革命运动又进入了一个新阶段。
    革命就是一个阶级推翻一个阶级。革命的根本问题就是政权问题。革命就是要夺权。在无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义和资本主义决战的关键时刻，在资产阶级向无产阶级专政发动猖狂进攻的关键时刻，我们就是要挺身而出，把无产阶级专政的领导权，把文化大革命运动的领导权，把报纸和一切舆论工具的领导权，把经济命脉的领导权，坚决地毫不犹豫地统统从那班资产阶级老爷们的手中夺过来。
    调和主义，行吗？不行！
    改良主义，行吗？不行！
    温情主义，行吗？不行！
    天下者，我们的天下；国家者，我们的国家；社会者，我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？
    革命造反派把领导权牢牢地掌握在自己手里，才能真正贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    有一派人劝告我们，不要离开他们（指党内走资本主义道路的当权派），离开了他们你们不好办。让这种劝告滚蛋吧！他们以为没有他们不行，我们偏不信那一套。
    实践证明，那些大大小小的资产阶级分子倒下去了，我们的日子，不是难过，恰恰相反，一天比一天好过，一天比一天兴旺起来。
    没有他们，我们只会过得更好。因为那帮子家伙，有的是党内走资本主义道路的当权派，有的是始终坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。打倒了他们，革命造反派站起来了，文化大革命就必然会出现蓬蓬勃勃的新局面。
    毛主席一直教导我们，人民群众有无限的创造力。我们最最坚决支持革命造反派的首创精神。我们坚定地相信，革命造反派夺了权，只要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，放手发动群众，把一切支持革命造反派的群众团结起来，逐步建立新的秩序，一定能抓好革命，促好生产。革命造反派不怕压力，不怕围攻，不怕打击，难道还怕夺了权后不能把担子挑起来吗？那种相信没有他们就不行了的人，除了自己不敢造反外，还不准别人造反。这是《阿Q正传》中的假洋鬼子作风。在文化大革命已深入开展的今天，新假洋鬼子们可以休矣！
    一个又一个党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线的人倒下去了，一批又一批坚定的革命造反派把权夺过来了，都是大好事，都是令人鼓舞的好消息！
    革命造反派将在斗争中学会斗争，学会夺权，学会掌权。他们可能由于缺乏经验，会犯这样或那样的错误，那也无关大局。只要他们努力去掌握毛泽东思想，善于在斗争中团结大多数，及时总结经验，有错就改，坚持斗争，最后的胜利，必定属于革命造反派。
    “沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春”。一小撮资产阶级老爷们的末日到了，让我们鼓掌欢呼吧！　　　　　　　　　　（新华社上海十九日电）
