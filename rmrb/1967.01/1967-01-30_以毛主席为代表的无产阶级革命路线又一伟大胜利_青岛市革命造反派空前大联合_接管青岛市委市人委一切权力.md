The proletarian revolutionary rebels in Qingdao, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have achieved unprecedented unity. A Revolutionary Rebel Committee composed of 23 units was solemnly established and has formally taken over all powers from the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee.

In the struggle to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionary rebels in Qingdao have overcome countless waves of turmoil and broken through numerous obstacles to form the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee. On the morning of the 22nd, tens of thousands of red revolutionary rebels gathered at Huichuan People's Square to hold a grand power seizure meeting and enthusiastically celebrate the establishment of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee. At the meeting, the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee solemnly declared to the people of the entire city: We have seized the political, economic, and cultural powers of Qingdao from the handful of power-holders within the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. This is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! This is another great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! The revolutionary rebel fighters in the entire venue enthusiastically cheered, "The power is seized well! Seized well!!"

The meeting began after all the rebel fighters paid their respects to the most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and played the song "The East Is Red." The entire venue enthusiastically shouted: "Unite, proletarian revolutionary rebels!" "Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified!" "Seize the revolution, promote production, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Oppose economism, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The meeting pointed out that the recent joint meeting held by the workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in Qingdao to expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of the provincial and municipal committees has exposed a large amount of evidence proving that a handful of power-holders within the provincial and municipal committees who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have committed heinous crimes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Qingdao. They manufactured the two infamous counter-revolutionary incidents of "August 25" and "September 1" known nationwide. All this tells us revolutionary rebels: With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. They dared to use the state's judicial and public security organs to implement white terror, encircle revolutionary students and masses, and label thousands of revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," "fake leftists, real rightists," etc., all because they held various powers. The storm of class struggle has educated us revolutionary rebels, making us understand that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. We revolutionary rebels must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and seize this power.

The meeting called on the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres in the entire city: Let us unite and combine under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, beat the drums of revolution, and seize all kinds of powers from the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. Let the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly over the entire city!

The meeting read out the "Letter to the People of the Entire City of Qingdao" from 23 revolutionary rebel organizations, including Qingdao Dongfanghong, Laoshan Dongfanghong Commune, and the General Liaison Headquarters of Red Guards in Qingdao's Schools and Universities.

The meeting also read out the telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and the "First Order" from the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee.

After the meeting, the vast revolutionary rebel army, with a giant portrait of Chairman Mao leading the way, held a grand parade.

Wang Xiaoyu, the deputy mayor of Qingdao, who has long been in resolute struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, issued a statement on January 22, expressing firm support for the power seizure struggle of the Qingdao Revolutionary Rebel Committee. In the statement, he pointed out, "This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought." "This is a great revolutionary innovation, to which we give enthusiastic cheers!" The statement also said, "Revolutionary comrades must be highly vigilant, the class enemy will not readily accept their defeat." "All revolutionary rebel comrades must unite, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, defend the victory fruits, consolidate the victory fruits, and achieve greater new victories."

　　以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线又一伟大胜利
　　青岛市革命造反派空前大联合
　　接管青岛市委市人委一切权力
    新华社济南二十九日电　山东青岛市无产阶级革命造反派，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，实现了空前大联合，由二十三个单位组成的革命造反委员会庄严宣告成立，并正式接管了青岛市委、市人民委员会的一切权力。
    青岛市广大无产阶级革命造反派，在奋起击退资产阶级反动路线新反扑的搏斗中，战胜层层惊涛骇浪，冲破重重阻力，组成了青岛市革命造反委员会。二十二日上午，数万名红色革命造反者在汇泉人民广场，隆重举行夺权大会，并热烈庆祝青岛市革命造反委员会的成立。会上，青岛市革命造反委员会向全市人民庄严宣告：我们已把青岛市的政治、经济和文化大权，从青岛市委、青岛市人民委员会内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手中夺过来了，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！全场的革命造反战士无不热烈欢呼这个权夺得好！夺得好！！
    大会在全体造反战士向最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席致敬和高奏《东方红》乐曲后开始，全场热烈高呼：“无产阶级革命造反派联合起来！”“革命无罪，造反有理！”“抓革命，促生产，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利！”“反对经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！”“无产阶级专政万岁！”“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    大会指出，最近青岛市工农群众、革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部联合召开的揭发批判省、市委资产阶级反动路线大会，揭发出的大量事实证明：省、市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，在青岛市前段无产阶级文化大革命中犯下了滔天罪行。他们制造了全国闻名的“八·二五”、“九·一”两次反革命事件。这一切都向我们革命造反派说明：有了政权就有了一切，丧失了政权就丧失了一切。他们之所以敢在无产阶级专政的光天化日之下，动用国家的政法机关，派出大量公安人员，实行白色恐怖，围剿革命学生和革命群众，把数以千计的革命群众打成“反革命”、“假左派、真右派”等等，就是因为他们把持着各种权力。阶级斗争的暴风雨教育了我们革命造反派，使我们懂得了革命的根本问题是政权问题。我们革命造反派必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把这个权夺过来。
    大会号召全市广大工农群众、革命师生、革命知识分子、革命干部：让我们在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下团结起来，联合起来，猛擂革命战鼓，从走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手里，把党、政、财、文等各种大权统统夺回来，让毛泽东思想红旗插遍全市！
    大会宣读了青岛东方红、崂山东方红公社、青岛大中学校红卫兵联络总部等二十三个革命造反团体的《告青岛全市人民书》。
    大会还宣读了青岛市革命造反委员会给毛主席的致敬电和《第一号通令》。
    会后，浩浩荡荡的革命造反大军，以毛主席的巨幅画像为前导，举行了声势浩大的游行。
    早就同青岛市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子坚决作斗争的青岛市副市长王效禹同志，于一月二十二日发表声明，表示坚决支持青岛市革命造反委员会的夺权斗争。他在声明中指出，“这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。”“这是一个伟大的革命创举，向它热烈的欢呼！”声明中还说，革命同志“要高度提高警惕，阶级敌人决不会甘心他们的失败。”“一切革命造反的同志们，必须联合起来，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，保卫胜利果实，巩固胜利果实，夺取更大的新胜利。”
