Our Urgent Appeal

We call on the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country to uphold the spirit of thorough revolution, to firmly defend their revolutionary positions during the Spring Festival, and to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." Become pioneers in revolution and models in production!

Recently, five revolutionary rebel organizations serving at Beijing Railway Station discovered that a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line are using the Spring Festival to engage in counter-revolutionary economism, launching a new counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary rebels' struggle for power. For this reason, they issued the following "Our Urgent Appeal":

At present, the great revolutionary storm of the proletarian revolutionary rebels seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is sweeping the country with irresistible force. It is at this critical moment that some units' capitalist-roaders are using the approach of the Spring Festival to spread the idea of "considering the workers' Spring Festival leave" and other such notions, attempting to corrupt revolutionary workers and incite them to leave their production posts to protect themselves. We must expose these reactionary tricks of the enemy and promptly recognize the new offensive of counter-revolutionary economism, and repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Currently, there are still hundreds of thousands of out-of-town workers and revolutionary students in Beijing who need to return to their original units. According to preliminary statistics on January 25, Beijing alone has more than 7,500 local workers planning to return home before the Spring Festival (note: this is only the first day of Spring Festival ticket registration). This will inevitably affect the return of out-of-town workers to their units, putting immense pressure on railway transportation, and also affecting the power struggle and production in their units. For this reason, we issue an urgent appeal to the proletarian revolutionary masses across the country, to revolutionary workers across the country, to revolutionary students across the country, and to all revolutionary comrades:

1. The proletarian revolutionary masses across the country must uphold the spirit of thorough revolution, resolutely not leave their revolutionary positions during the Spring Festival, and firmly carry the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary masses to the end. Keep the party power, state power, and financial power firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses. We will not rest until our goal is achieved!

2. Revolutionary rebels must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," become pioneers in revolution, and models in production. During the Spring Festival, work full shifts and make production even better, reporting the best results to our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao.

3. The railway system must ensure that out-of-town revolutionary workers and students in Beijing return to their original units before the Spring Festival to participate in the power struggle and production struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses in their units.

4. Revolutionary students and teachers in colleges and universities across the country must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and spend a revolutionary Spring Festival. During the Spring Festival, they must join the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to carry the power struggle to the end. At the same time, they must go deep into factories, mines, enterprises, and neighborhoods to vigorously promote Mao Zedong Thought. Do not return home to visit relatives during the Spring Festival to reduce the pressure on railway transportation and ensure the quick return of out-of-town workers to their original units.

5. All revolutionary rebel comrades must heighten their revolutionary vigilance, guard against the sabotage of class enemies, and be alert to capitalist-roaders within the Party using the Spring Festival to economically corrupt revolutionary masses.

United, the proletarian revolutionary masses will carry the power struggle to the end!

Thoroughly defeat counter-revolutionary revisionist economism!

Grasp revolution and promote production!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand long lives to our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao!

　　我们的紧急呼吁书
    呼吁全国各地无产阶级革命派发扬彻底革命精神，在春节期间坚守自己的革命阵地，不折不扣地执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，成为抓革命的闯将，成为促生产的模范
    本报讯　最近，在北京车站服务的革命造反派的五个组织，发现一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏家伙们，利用春节，大搞反革命经济主义，向无产阶级革命造反派的夺权斗争实行新的反扑，为此，发出了《我们的紧急呼吁书》，全文如下：
    目前，无产阶级革命造反派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展夺权斗争的伟大革命风暴，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，席卷全国。正是在这个关键时刻，有些单位的走资本主义道路当权派，利用春节即将来临时刻，向本单位职工散布什么“照顾职工春节放假”呀等等，企图以此来腐蚀革命职工，煽动职工离开生产岗位，保护自己。对于敌人的这种反动伎俩必须予以揭穿，及时识破反革命经济主义新的进攻，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    现在，在北京市还有几十万外地职工和外地革命师生急待返回原单位；而根据一月二十五日一天的初步统计，北京市就有七千五百余名本市职工准备春节以前回去探亲（注意：这仅是春节登记预购火车票的第一天）。这样势必影响外地职工返回本单位，给铁路运输造成极大压力，同时也影响本单位的夺权斗争和生产。为此，我们向全国无产阶级革命派、向全国革命职工、向全国革命师生和一切革命同志发出紧急呼吁：
    一、全国各地无产阶级革命派要发扬彻底革命精神，在春节期间，坚决不离开自己的革命阵地，把无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争坚决进行到底。把党权、政权、财权牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。不达目的，誓不罢休！
    二、革命造反派，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不折不扣地执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，成为抓革命的闯将，成为促生产的模范。在春节期间，出满勤，把生产搞得好上加好，以最优异的成绩，向我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席汇报。
    三、铁路系统应保证在京的外地革命职工和革命师生，在春节以前迅速返回原单位，去参加本单位的无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，参加生产斗争。
    四、全国大专院校革命师生要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，过一个革命化春节。在春节期间，要和广大工农兵一起，把夺权斗争进行到底。同时要深入工矿企业和街道，大张旗鼓地宣传毛泽东思想。春节期间不回家探亲，以减少对铁路运输的压力，保证外地职工迅速返回原单位。
    五、所有革命造反派同志要提高革命警惕性，严防阶级敌人破坏，警惕走资本主义道路的当权派，利用春节期间对革命群众进行经济腐蚀。
    无产阶级革命派联合起来，把夺权斗争坚决进行到底！
    彻底打垮反革命修正主义的经济主义！
    抓革命，促生产！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！
