Under the surging waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the bourgeois reactionary line is facing total collapse. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and diehard elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line have been surrounded by the masses and are facing annihilation. However, they are unwilling to accept their defeat. As they retreat politically, they resort to economic bribery, inciting some misguided masses to create a stir over economicism, attempting to divert the serious political struggle into the wrong path of economicism, and to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

History often repeats itself. Like all historical clowns, these "heroes" who oppose the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao are playing the same old tricks of economicism, which are nothing new but old rubbish from the garbage heaps of old and modern revisionism.

To understand the nature of economicism in the current Cultural Revolution, let us review the history of the international communist movement over the past hundred years.

For more than a hundred years, the bourgeoisie has used two strategies in their class struggle against the proletariat: the strategy of the executioner and the strategy of the "priest." Sometimes, they reveal their naked faces of executioners, resorting to violent suppression; sometimes, they put on the gentle guise of priests, softening and disintegrating the revolutionary masses. These two strategies are used alternately or simultaneously. Economic bribery is the strategy of the priest, which numbs the minds of the masses. Especially when they are at a disadvantage, economic bribery becomes their lifeline to soften the working class and preserve themselves.

A hundred years ago, when the British workers' movement was surging and powerfully striking at the bourgeois reactionary rule, the bourgeoisie, fearing the strength of the workers, could not use armed suppression. They took a portion of the huge profits they had extorted from the workers and bribed the upper stratum of the workers, the labor aristocracy, spreading the "trade unionism" trend. "Trade unionism" held that the working class only needed to establish its own trade union organizations and engage in economic struggles to improve living conditions, without touching the capitalist system. At that time, the great teachers Marx and Engels sharply exposed and criticized this, calling on the broad masses of workers to oppose "trade unionism." The world workers' movement thus advanced in the correct direction.

More than sixty years ago, when the Russian revolutionary movement was raging, the economicists, who were the agents of the Russian tsar in the workers' ranks, emerged. The economicists made "struggling for improved economic conditions" the "motto" of the workers' movement, saying that "every kopek increase in wages is more valuable than any socialism and any politics." They said, "It is better to buy a sausage than to buy a copy of the Communist Manifesto." The spread of economicist ideas in the workers' movement caused ideological division, political wavering, and organizational disintegration in the working class, seriously hindering the workers' movement and party-building work. The great teacher Lenin thoroughly criticized and exposed economicism, dealing it a fatal blow. Thus, the world workers' movement again advanced in the correct direction.

In the Soviet Union, forty years after the victory of the October Revolution, the capitalist-roaders in the Soviet Party and state, represented by Khrushchev, adapted to the needs of the imperialist policy of peaceful evolution, inherited the legacy of economicism, and promoted "material incentives," money worship, welfareism, and the so-called "potato with beef" communism, leading the Soviet Union onto the road of capitalist restoration. This is a bitter lesson for the international communist movement. Khrushchev's welfareism and material incentives are variants of British trade unionism and Russian economicism; they are of the same breed.

More than a hundred years of history show that economicism has always been a weapon of the bourgeoisie in their political struggle against the proletariat, a thorough and through counter-revolutionary revisionism. It is a dagger that kills without bloodshed, an opium that numbs the people, and a poisoned candy. Before the proletariat seizes power, it induces the working class to worship the spontaneity of the workers' movement, oppose revolutionary theory guiding the revolutionary movement, and attempt to make revolutionary people content with immediate and partial interests, thus denying the political struggle of the proletariat. Therefore, economicism is a tool for maintaining the capitalist system and opposing the proletarian revolution. It can only keep the working class in a state of slavery forever. After the proletariat seizes power, it spreads the idea of pursuing personal interests and temporary benefits without regard to collective interests, national interests, and long-term interests, advocating bourgeois individualism. It promotes capitalist spontaneity and is a corrosive agent that disintegrates the socialist system and proletarian dictatorship. Economicism is even more harmful under the socialist system; it is a tool for the bourgeoisie to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration.

Currently, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and diehard elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line are stirring up the black wind of economicism. They arbitrarily increase wages and welfare, recklessly distribute various funds and materials, incite the masses to seize public housing, and so on. On the surface, they seem to be concerned about the masses' livelihood, correcting past mistakes, and supporting the workers' revolutionary actions. In reality, they are launching a new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line under the cover of economic interests. This is their more sinister and vicious new plot to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a new signal of their desperate struggle as they face annihilation.

The ultimate goal of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and diehard elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to retain the party, government, and military power they have usurped and to turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. With power, one has everything; without power, one loses everything. In capitalist countries, the working class and laboring people are in a position of being oppressed and exploited because they do not have their own power. In socialist countries, the working class and laboring people have achieved a great turnaround in politics, culture, and economy because they have their own power. Forty years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out that the peasant movement must "knock down the landlord's power and establish the peasants' power." He also emphasized, "This is a very serious and urgent struggle." "Without victory in this struggle, all rent reductions, interest reductions, demands for land, and other means of production, and other economic struggles will have no chance of success." Therefore, the proletariat must first seize power from the bourgeoisie to seize the means of production and free itself from slavery; the fundamental interests of the proletariat can only be realized through political mobilization, violent seizure of power, and the establishment and consolidation of the state machine of proletarian dictatorship. If the tasks of the proletariat are limited to economic struggles, then capitalism can never be buried, and the proletariat and laboring people will forever be in a state of slavery.

In socialist countries where the proletariat has seized power, the issue of power remains the fundamental issue of revolution. This is because the overthrown exploiting class and their agents, that handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, are always trying to seize power from the proletariat to restore their lost paradise and develop the interests of their privileged class. The counter-revolutionary revisionist line that ruled the old Beijing Municipal Committee, the old Propaganda Department, and the old Cultural Department is a vivid proof of this. Therefore, after seizing power, the revolutionary people, in order to preserve the fruits of the revolution and transition to a communist society, must carry out the struggle between the two lines of socialism and capitalism, between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and carry the socialist revolution to the end. If we only focus on economicism and material incentives and only pursue welfare, we may lose everything and return to a life worse than that of cattle and horses.

All class struggles are political struggles. After the proletariat seizes power, no matter how many things there are to do, they must not forget about power. Forgetting about power is forgetting the fundamentals, forgetting the center, and being a careless and confused person.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to overthrow those capitalist-roaders within the Party, sweep away all ghosts and monsters, thoroughly smash the "four olds" of the exploiting class, and establish the "four news" of the proletariat. It is to establish the great thought of Mao Zedong, eliminate the social basis of revisionism, and prevent the restoration of capitalism. If we forget the direction of the struggle and only pursue wages and welfare, pursuing economicism, we are shortsighted. In the end, if Khrushchev-style counter-revolutionary revisionists come to power and restore capitalism, then we will lose our heads for a few pieces of paper money now. This is political suicide.

One of the reasons for the spread of economicism is that some people among the masses have capitalist spontaneous forces and private ownership ideas left over from thousands of years. We must resolutely respond to the call of Comrade Lin Biao, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take the "Three Articles" as our motto, and learn from them to carry out ideological revolutionization, and eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionist economicism from our minds.

In recent days, the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai have exposed the new counterattack plot of the bourgeois reactionary line and have launched a powerful counterattack. Those who promote economicism have become rats that everyone wants to beat. The heroic Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have fully demonstrated the sublime spirit and noble qualities of communism in this struggle against economicism.

It can be foreseen that with the overthrow of economicism and the smashing of the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, what will follow is another great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Highly raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist economicism!

    经济主义是工人运动的腐蚀剂
    红战鞭
    在汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命激流怒涛的冲击下，资产阶级反动路线面临全线崩溃，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，已陷入广大群众的层层包围之中，面临灭亡的命运。但他们不甘心自己的失败。随着政治上的节节败退，他们就利用经济收买手法，煽动部分不明真相的群众，大闹经济主义，企图把一场严肃的政治斗争引入经济主义的歧途，转移斗争的大方向，妄想扼杀这场无产阶级文化大革命。
    历史上的小丑常常会重复登台表演。和历史上的所有小丑一样，这些反对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的“英雄好汉们”所玩弄的经济主义把戏，并不是什么新鲜货色，而是从老修正主义和现代修正主义的垃圾堆里拣来的破烂。
    为了了解目前文化大革命中出现的经济主义是什么货色，我们不妨回顾一下一百多年来的国际共产主义运动史。
    一百多年来，资产阶级对无产阶级进行阶级斗争，从来就有两种策略：刽子手的策略和“牧师”的策略。有时，他们露出赤裸裸的刽子手嘴脸，进行暴力镇压；有时却装出牧师的温和姿态，软化与瓦解革命群众。两种策略，或交替使用，或同时使用。经济收买则是牧师的策略，它从思想上麻醉群众。特别是当他们处于劣势时，经济收买便成了他们软化工人阶级、保存自身的救命稻草。
    一百年前，英国工人运动风起云涌，猛烈地冲击着资产阶级的反动统治时，资产阶级慑于工人力量的强大，未能采用武装镇压，就拿出他们从工人身上榨取来的巨额利润中的一部分，收买工人中的上层分子即工人贵族，散布“工联主义”思潮。“工联主义”认为，工人阶级只需建立自己的工会组织，进行改善生活条件的经济斗争，而无须触动资本主义制度。当时，伟大的导师马克思、恩格斯对此进行了尖锐的揭发和批判，号召广大工人起来反对“工联主义”，世界工人运动沿着正确的方向前进了。
    六十多年前，俄国革命运动如火如荼地发展，在建立真正统一的马克思主义政党的前前后后，作为俄国沙皇在工人队伍中的代理人——经济派应运而生了。经济派把“为改善经济状况而斗争”作为工人运动的“座右铭”，说什么“每一个卢布的工资增加一个戈比要比任何的社会主义和任何政治都更加切实可贵。”说什么“与其拿钱去买一本《共产党宣言》，不如去买一根香肠。”经济派思想在工人运动中的泛滥，造成了工人阶级队伍思想上的分离，政治上的动摇和组织上的涣散，给工人运动和建党工作造成了严重的障碍。伟大的导师列宁又对此进行了彻底的批判和揭发，给经济主义以致命的打击，于是世界工人运动又沿着正确的方向前进了。
    在十月革命胜利四十年以后的苏联，赫鲁晓夫等一伙资产阶级在苏联党和国家内的代理人，适应帝国主义和平演变政策的需要，继承了经济主义的衣钵，在苏联大搞“物质刺激”，钞票挂帅，大搞福利主义，实行所谓“土豆烧牛肉”的共产主义，使苏联走上资本主义复辟的道路。这是国际共产主义运动中的惨痛教训。赫鲁晓夫的福利主义、物质刺激是英国工联主义和俄国经济派的变种，它们完全是一号货色。
    一百多年的历史表明，经济主义从来就是资产阶级对无产阶级进行政治斗争的武器，是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义。它是杀人不见血的匕首，是麻醉人民的鸦片，是包着蜜糖的砒霜。在无产阶级取得政权之前，它诱使工人阶级崇拜工人运动的自发性，反对革命理论指导革命运动，企图使革命人民满足于眼前的局部的利益，从而否认无产阶级的政治斗争。因此，经济主义是维护资本主义制度和反对无产阶级革命的工具。它只能使工人阶级永远处于奴隶的地位。在无产阶级取得政权之后，它散布不顾集体利益、国家利益、长远利益而单纯追求个人利益、暂时利益，鼓吹资产阶级个人主义，它提倡资本主义自发倾向，是瓦解社会主义制度和无产阶级专政的腐蚀剂。经济主义在社会主义制度下，有更大的危害性，它是资产阶级进行反革命复辟的工具。
    目前，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子刮起经济主义的黑风，他们随意增加工资、福利，滥发各种经费、物资，煽动群众强占公房，等等。他们表面上似乎在关心群众生活，改正过去的错误缺点，支持工人的革命行动，实质上是在经济利益掩护下的资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，这是他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命的更加阴险毒辣的新阴谋，是他们面临灭亡而垂死挣扎的新信号。
    一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子破坏无产阶级文化大革命，归根结底，就是要保住他们所窃踞的一部分党政军权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。
    毛主席一再教导我们，革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权，就有了一切，没有政权，就丧失一切。在资本主义国家里的工人阶级和劳动人民，所以处于被压迫被剥削的地位，就是因为还没有自己的政权。社会主义国家的工人阶级和劳动人民，之所以得到政治、文化、经济上的大翻身，就是因为有了自己的政权。四十年前，毛主席就指出，农民运动必须“把地主权力打下去，把农民权力长上来。”他还强调指出：“这是一个极严重极紧要的斗争。”“这个斗争不胜利，一切减租减息，要求土地及其他生产手段等等的经济斗争，决无胜利之可能。”因此，无产阶级要夺取生产资料，摆脱自己被奴役的境地，首先必须从资产阶级那里，夺得政权；无产阶级的根本利益，只有通过政治动员、暴力夺取政权，建立并巩固无产阶级专政的国家机器，才能实现。如果把无产阶级的任务局限在经济斗争内，那么，就永远不能埋葬资本主义，无产阶级和劳动人民只能永远处于被奴役的地位。
    在无产阶级取得政权的社会主义国家里，政权问题仍然是革命的根本问题。这是因为被推翻了的剥削阶级及其代理人，那一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，为了恢复他们失去的天堂，为了发展他们的特权阶层利益，每时每刻都企图从无产阶级手里夺取政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。统治旧北京市委、旧中宣部、旧文化部的反革命修正主义路线，就是生动的证明。所以，革命人民在取得政权后，为着保住革命的成果，并过渡到共产主义社会，就必须开展社会主义与资本主义两条道路、无产阶级与资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，把社会主义革命进行到底。如果只热中于经济主义、物质刺激，只搞福利，我们就可能丧失一切，重新过牛马不如的生活。
    一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争。无产阶级在取得政权后，无论有怎样千头万绪的事，也不能忘记政权。忘记了政权，就是忘记了根本，忘记了中心，就是马大哈，糊涂虫。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命就是要斗倒那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，大破剥削阶级的“四旧”，大立无产阶级的“四新”，大立伟大的毛泽东思想，挖掉修正主义的社会基础，防止资本主义复辟。如果忘记了斗争的大方向，而单纯去搞工资福利，搞经济主义，就是鼠目寸光。到头来，一旦赫鲁晓夫式的反革命修正主义分子上了台，复辟资本主义，那么，我们现在得到的是几张钞票，而将来失去的却是脑袋。这等于政治上的自杀。
    经济主义泛滥的原因之一，就是因为一些群众中存在资本主义自发势力和几千年遗留下来的私有观念。我们一定要坚决响应林彪同志的号召，活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，学了就要用，搞好思想革命化，从思想上清除反革命修正主义的经济主义的流毒。
    近日来，上海广大的革命群众已经揭穿了资产阶级反动路线新反扑的大阴谋，并进行了有力的还击。推行经济主义的混蛋们，成了人人喊打的过街老鼠。英雄的上海工人革命造反派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在这场反对经济主义的斗争中，充分表现出共产主义的崇高精神和高贵品质。
    可以预料，随着经济主义的被打倒，资产阶级反动路线新反扑的被粉碎，伴随而来的，必定是无产阶级文化大革命的又一伟大胜利。
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底打倒反革命修正主义的经济主义！
