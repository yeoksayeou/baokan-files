Shanghai revolutionary rebels discuss their experiences in smashing the enemy's sugar-coated bullet attacks

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 20th: Shanghai revolutionary rebel workers, in the struggle to seize the revolution and promote production, and to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, have actively studied and applied the "Three Articles," breaking private interests and establishing public interests. They have shown the heroic spirit of unyielding proletarian revolutionaries, who are neither moved by poverty nor tempted by wealth. They have timely exposed the plots of a handful of bad elements. They have published articles in the *Liberation Daily*, enthusiastically discussing their experiences in using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to repel the class enemy's sugar-coated bullet attacks.

Recently, a handful of bad elements have shown great "concern" for our "living conditions." I studied Chairman Mao's works, dispelled the fog, and saw through their tricks. Revolutionary rebellion is absolutely not for personal gain.

A member of the "Forever Loyal to Mao Zedong Thought" combat team at Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, Wang Guanhua, wrote in his article: Recently, our factory has also been hit by the economistic wind. Some power-holders who are taking the capitalist road suddenly changed their attitude and became very "concerned" about us. They repeatedly sought our opinions on living conditions and benefits. Once, the person in charge of labor protection called me to a meeting and "kindly" asked, "What do you need?" "First, issue winter clothes and leather shoes. Do you have any objections?" "Currently, supplies are tight. Should we buy them first?" They were so "humble" and "enthusiastic," showing extreme concern.

These issues of labor protection supplies have indeed been raised by the workers in our iron workshop for several years, but they have never been resolved. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have been rebelling against the power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and against the bourgeois reactionary line. We have not raised these economic benefit issues at all. Why do these power-holders suddenly keep bringing up this issue? I found it very strange. At this moment, Chairman Mao's words echoed in my ears: "Communist Party members must ask 'why' about everything, must think it over carefully in their own minds, see if it conforms to reality, see if it is reasonable, and absolutely not follow blindly, absolutely not advocate slavishness." I thought about it and asked myself several "whys": Why is the economistic wind blowing so strongly in society? And why does it appear precisely at this critical moment of the struggle between the two lines? At the same time, I recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; act in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups; be responsible to the people and to the party's leading organs at the same time. These are our starting points." I suddenly saw clearly. This is absolutely not a matter of a winter coat or a pair of leather shoes, but a plot by those power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They are using "correcting shortcomings" as a pretext and economism as bait to corrupt and disintegrate us revolutionary rebels, trying to lead this serious political struggle astray into the economistic path, attempting to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; then, they will turn around and accuse the revolutionary rebels of rebelling for personal gain. This is a very treacherous and malicious political plot. We must not fall for it!

Our starting point for revolutionary rebellion is only one: "act in the interests of the people." We are responsible to the party and the people, not "in the interests of individuals or small groups." For the sake of the party and the people, for the sake of the people's eternal redness, for the sake of defending our beloved leader Chairman Mao, for the sake of defending the party central committee led by Chairman Mao, for the sake of defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we revolutionary rebels are willing to endure beatings, hunger, bloodshed, and even sacrifice everything, "daring to be skinned alive and pull the emperor off his horse," to root out all counter-revolutionary revisionists and ghosts and snakes, and to overthrow them completely. We are not rebelling for personal gain, forgetting the fundamental task of this cultural revolution, and rebelling for the interests of individuals or small groups. Otherwise, it would be a fake rebellion, a fake revolution!

Chairman Mao's thoughts have armed me, and I firmly replied to them: "We do not want winter coats or leather shoes. We want the proletarian revolutionary line and Mao Zedong Thought represented by Chairman Mao!"

The fact that this economistic wind was resisted shows me deeply: If it were not for Chairman Mao's words reminding me, I would have fallen for it. Therefore, in this complex class struggle, only by seriously, diligently, and actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm ourselves, can we have a far-reaching vision, stand firm, and withstand the test of stormy waves; only then can we dispel the fog, see through everything, and expose the class enemy's tricks!

A true revolutionary rebel should be able to stand firm against the enemy's hard attacks and even more firmly resist the sugar-coated bullets.

Resisting the wind of seizing houses

An old worker and rebel team member from Hongqi Boiler Factory, Shao Axing, used the "Three Articles" as a weapon to resist the wind of seizing public housing. He wrote in his article: I am an old lathe worker in my fifties, with eight people in my family living in a low, dilapidated wooden house. In the past, my wife repeatedly urged me to apply for a house from the factory or the housing management bureau. After the New Year this year, some people who had deceived others into seizing houses came to tell my wife, "Your house is too small. Go and seize a house quickly. We have already seized one." When I returned home from work, as soon as I entered the door, she urged me to find a house. A house is indeed very much needed for our family, so I asked her, "Where is the house?" She said, "Now everyone is seizing houses outside. The people upstairs have also seized a house. You are a rebel, go and rebel, seize a house!" When I heard her say this, I was shocked and immediately said loudly, "We rebel team members absolutely will not do such things!"

This made her very angry, and she said, "You, as a rebel team member, only know how to stay in the factory every day until late. Now people are going out to rebel and seize houses, and you don't go. Are you still a rebel team member?"

I listened to her words and found them more and more unreasonable, so I patiently explained to her, "Our family needs a house, but if we go and seize the state's house, then we are not rebelling against the bourgeoisie, but against the proletariat." At this time, I opened the "Three Articles" and read the first paragraph of "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. This army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly for the interests of the people."

I explained to her: We Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We must be vigilant and keep our eyes open. Inciting the masses to demand wages, fight for benefits, and seize houses is a big plot by a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. It is a new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and we must completely smash it. We should listen to Chairman Mao's words and thoroughly work and struggle for the interests of the people, not for personal interests. I also told her: We are all from the old society, and we cannot forget the bitterness of the old society. One year, just before the New Year, our family could not even eat three meals of thin porridge a day. When we went to borrow a little money from the boss, he scolded us fiercely before we could finish two sentences, "No money, don't celebrate the New Year!" and immediately chased me away. After liberation, we had a fixed income, our lives stabilized, and our days were much better than before. We must not forget the kindness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to us laboring people! We must not live well and forget the past bitterness. Although our house is a bit small now, we should think of the country's difficulties and overcome them. At this point, tears welled up in my wife's eyes, and she said excitedly, "I was wrong!"

In this struggle, I deeply felt: We workers' revolutionary rebel team members should be worthy of being glorious, true revolutionary rebels. The enemy comes hard, we are not afraid; sugar-coated bullets come, we must resist even more. We workers' revolutionary rebel team should listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

After studying Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, I saw through a handful of power-holders' plot to squander state property and incite us to leave the factory.

Returning the travel tickets and defending the production posts

A worker from Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, Zhang Guorong, introduced in an article how he studied the "Three Articles," resisted the wind, and defended his production post. He said: In the first half of this month, our factory also had the wind of apprentices leaving the factory to travel. At that time, I was also bewitched by this wind and thought that this opportunity was hard to come by. At this time, some teachers reminded me, "Little Zhang, study Chairman Mao's quotations well. Why do they let you travel at this critical time?" Indeed, why do these power-holders allow us young apprentices to travel at this time? But my train ticket had already been bought. Should I go or not? Public and private interests clashed in my mind.

Chairman Mao said, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." Chairman Mao's words made me see clearly and exposed their plot to incite apprentices to leave the factory, attempting to stop production and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. I am a revolutionary youth and should remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must not only see the immediate, partial benefits and forget the long-term interests of the working class." We are revolutionary rebels and must listen to Chairman Mao's words and be models of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Later, I also studied the "Three Articles" and compared myself with Comrade White's two "extremes," feeling that I was wrong to leave my production post to travel. Since I was wrong, I should act according to Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our responsibility is to the people. Every word, every action, every policy must be in the interests of the people. If there are mistakes, they must be corrected. This is what it means to be responsible to the people." After repeated struggles in my mind, I finally made up my mind to return the travel expenses I had received and to return the train tickets I had bought, staying in the factory to continue political struggle and production struggle, resolutely seizing the revolution and promoting production, using actual actions to repel the bourgeois sugar-coated bullet attacks and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

    活学活用“老三篇”横扫经济主义黑风
　　上海革命造反派工人谈粉碎敌人糖衣炮弹进攻的体会
    据新华社上海二十日电　上海革命造反派工人在抓革命、促生产，粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的斗争中，活学活用“老三篇”，破私立公，表现了无产阶级革命战士威武不屈，贫贱不移，富贵不淫的英雄气概，及时揭穿了一小撮坏家伙的阴谋。他们纷纷在《解放日报》上发表文章，畅谈自己靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，打退阶级敌人糖衣炮弹进攻的体会。
        最近，一小撮坏家伙非常“关心”我
    们的“生活福利”，我学习了毛主席著作，
      拨开迷雾，识破了他们的诡计
    革命造反绝不图个人私利
    上海国棉十七厂永远忠于毛泽东思想战斗队队员王冠华在文章里说：最近，我们厂内也刮起了经济主义的歪风，某些走资本主义道路的当权派突然一反常态，变得十分“关心”我们了，接连征求我们革命造反派对于生活福利方面的意见。有一次，劳动保护负责人又找我去开会，“亲切”地问我：“需要什么东西？”
  “先发上装和皮鞋，有啥意见？”“目前东西很紧张，是否先买来？”真是又“虚心”，又“热情”，“关心”极了。
    这些劳动保护用品的问题，我们铁工间工人确实已经提了几年，但是始终没有得到解决。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一直在造党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，造资产阶级反动路线的反，对于这些经济福利问题一点也没有提到过。为什么这些当权派却在这个时候一个劲地提出这个问题呢？我感到十分奇怪。这时，我耳边响起了毛主席的话：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”心里就转了几个弯，问了几个为什么：为什么经济主义歪风在社会上刮得那么紧？又为什么偏偏出现在两条路线决战的关键时刻？同时，我又想起了毛主席的教导：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”我顿时心明眼亮了。这绝对不是一件上装、一双皮鞋的问题，而是那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙，在借“纠正缺点”为名，以经济主义作诱饵，腐蚀瓦解我们革命造反派，把这场严肃的政治斗争引入经济主义的歧途，妄图扼杀无产阶级文化大革命；然后，他们再向革命造反派倒打一耙，污蔑革命造反派是为私利造反。这是一个十分阴险毒辣的政治大阴谋，我们决不能上当！
    我们革命造反派造反的出发点只有一个，即“一切从人民的利益出发”。我们向党和人民负责，而不是“从个人或小集团的利益出发”。为了党和人民的利益，为了人民的江山永不变色，为了保卫敬爱的领袖毛主席，为了保卫以毛主席为首的党中央，为了保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，我们革命造反派宁愿挨打、饿饭、流血，甚至献出自己的一切，“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”，把反革命修正主义分子和牛鬼蛇神一个不漏地揪出来，统统打倒。我们决不是图眼前私利，忘掉这次文化大革命的根本任务，为个人或小集团的利益造反。否则，就是假造反，假革命！
    毛主席的思想武装了我，我就斩钉截铁地回答他们说：“我们不要上装、皮鞋，我们要的是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和毛泽东思想！”
    这次经济主义歪风被顶住的事实，使我深刻地体会到：如果不是毛主席的话提醒我，我准会上当。因此，在这复杂的阶级斗争中，只有认真地、刻苦地在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想把自己武装起来，才能目光远大，站稳立场，经得起惊涛骇浪的考验；才能拨开迷雾，洞察一切，识破阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计！
        一个真正的革命造反者，应该做到敌
    人硬的来，我们不怕，糖衣炮弹来，我们
    更能顶得住
    把抢房子的妖风顶回去
    红旗锅炉厂老工人、造反队员邵阿兴以“老三篇”为武器顶住了抢占公房的歪风。他在文章中说：我是一个五十多岁的车床老工人，家中有八口人，住在一间低矮的木屋里。过去我老伴三番五次要我向厂里或房管局去申请房子。今年元旦过后，一些受骗抢占到房子的人跑来告诉我老伴说：“你们房子太小，现在快去抢占一间，我们已经抢到了一间了。”等我下班回家，一踏进门，她就催促我去寻房子。房子，对我家来说实在太需要了，我就问她：“那里有房子？”她说：“现在外面都在抢房子，楼上人家也抢到了一间，你是造反队，可以去造反，抢一间房子来呀！”听到她这么一说，我吃了一惊，马上大声地说：“我们造反队员决不做这样的事情！”这一下，可把她气坏了，她说：“你这个造反队只知道在厂里每天搞得很迟回家。现在人家去造反抢房子，你不去，还算得上一个造反队员吗？”
    我听她的话越说越不对头，于是耐着性子对她讲：“我们家很需要房子，但是如果去抢国家的房子，那就不是造资产阶级的反，而是造无产阶级的反了。”这时，我翻开“老三篇”，把《为人民服务》的第一段念了一遍：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    我解释给她听：我们上海工人革命造反派坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线方面，我们一定要提高警惕，擦亮眼睛。煽动群众吵工资、争福利、抢房子，这是一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派耍的一个大阴谋，是资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，我们要彻底把它粉碎。我们应该听毛主席的话，彻底为人民的利益去工作、去斗争，而不是为了个人的利益。我又对她说：我们都是旧社会过来的人，旧社会的苦难我们不能忘记。有一年快到过年的时候，我们家连一天三餐稀粥也吃不饱，去向老板借支一点点钱，两句话没说完，他就气势汹汹地骂道：“没钞票就不要过年！”立刻把我撵跑了。解放后，我们有了固定的收入，生活安定了，日子也比过去好得多。我们千万不要忘记共产党和毛主席给我们劳动人民的恩情呀！我们决不能生活好了，就忘记过去的苦。目前我们虽然房子小一些，但是我们应该想到国家还是有一定的困难，这就需要我们去克服。说到这里，我老伴的眼眶里涌出了泪水，她激动地说：“我错了！”
    在这次斗争中，我深深体会到：我们工人革命造反队队员，应当不愧为一个光荣的真正的革命造反者。敌人硬的来，我们不怕；“糖衣炮弹”来，我们更要顶得住。我们工人革命造反队应该最最听毛主席的话，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
        我带着问题学习毛主席著作以后，识
    破了一小撮当权派挥霍国家财产、煽动我
      们离厂的阴谋
    退掉串连车票　坚守生产岗位
    上海国棉十七厂的一位艺徒张国荣在一篇文章里介绍了他学习“老三篇”，顶住歪风，坚守生产岗位的斗争过程。他说：本月上旬，我厂也刮起了艺徒离厂外出串连的风。当时我也被这股风迷住了，认为这个机会是难得的。这时，有些师傅就提醒我说：“小张，好好去学习学习毛主席的语录，为什么在这样紧张的时候，他们会让你们外出串连去？”是啊！为什么这些当权派在这个时候任意挥霍国家财富，让我们青年艺徒外出进行串连呢？但是，自己的车票已经买好了，是去？还是不去？公和私在头脑里展开了决战。
    毛主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”毛主席的话使我心明眼亮，识破了他们这一小撮人煽动艺徒离厂，妄图用停止生产来破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋诡计。我是一个革命青年，应该牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益。”我们是革命造反派，一定要听毛主席的话，做抓革命，促生产的模范。后来我又学习了“老三篇”，用白求恩同志的两个“极端”对照了自己，觉得自己要离开生产岗位出去串连是错了。既然错了，那就按照毛主席教导的“我们的责任，是向人民负责。每句话，每个行动，每项政策，都要适合人民的利益，如果有了错误，定要改正，这就叫向人民负责”去办。经过反复的思想斗争，我终于下定了决心，把自己所领到的路费退还，并把已买好的车票退掉，留在厂里坚持政治斗争和生产斗争，坚决做到抓革命，促生产，用实际行动打退资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
