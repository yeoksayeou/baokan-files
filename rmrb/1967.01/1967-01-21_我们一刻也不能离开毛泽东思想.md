We cannot be separated from Mao Zedong Thought for a moment. Comrade Mao Zedong is the most brilliant and greatest thinker for all oppressed peoples of the world, and the great helmsman of the world revolution. We and all the peoples of the world admire him greatly and feel proud of him.

Recently, we have read Chairman Mao's article "An Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society." This article points out the direction for revolutionaries and those who are preparing to become revolutionaries, enabling them to have a correct standpoint and to recognize their allied classes and their principal enemies in their struggles. Chairman Mao says: "The basic reason why all the revolutionary struggles in China in the past have achieved so little is that we have not been able to unite real friends to attack real enemies." Chairman Mao's brilliant conclusion is of historical significance. Not only should Chinese revolutionaries follow it, but revolutionaries all over the world should do so as well.

Comrade Mao Zedong has derived very precious theories from the practice of the Chinese revolution, and he is now guiding the world revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. As long as we take Mao Zedong Thought as our guide for all actions, any powerful forces and great difficulties can be overcome and conquered. We cannot be separated from the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought for a moment.

For us, to deviate from Mao Zedong Thought means to deviate from the spirit of the proletariat. To deviate from the spirit of the proletariat means to overestimate the enemy and forget the spirit of our class to dare to struggle, dare to rebel, and dare to make revolution.

　　我们一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想
    毛泽东同志是全世界被压迫人民最英明、最伟大的思想家，世界革命的伟大舵手。我们和全世界人民对他无限钦佩，为他感到自豪。
    我们最近读了毛主席的文章《中国社会各阶级的分析》。这篇文章给革命者和那些准备成为革命者的人指出了方向，使他们有了正确的立场和在他们的斗争中认清同盟的阶级和主要的敌人。毛主席说：“中国过去一切革命斗争成效甚少，其基本原因就是因为不能团结真正的朋友，以攻击真正的敌人。”毛主席的这一英明论断，是具有历史意义的论断，不仅中国革命者要照着去做，全世界革命者也要照着去做。
    毛泽东同志从中国革命的实践中得出十分可贵的理论，他正在指导世界革命。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。只要把毛泽东思想作为我们一切行动的指南，任何强大的力量和巨大的困难都是能够被战胜和克服的。我们一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想的指导。
    对我们来说，背离毛泽东思想就意味着背离无产阶级精神。背离无产阶级精神就意味着过高地估计敌人，忘掉我们本阶级的敢于斗争，敢于造反，敢于闹革命的精神。
