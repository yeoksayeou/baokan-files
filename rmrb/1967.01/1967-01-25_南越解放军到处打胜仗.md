The Liberation Army of South Vietnam is winning battles everywhere. A night battle annihilates an entire enemy battalion.

On the night of January 19, the armed forces of the liberation movement in the province of Chau Doc in South Vietnam completely annihilated an enemy battalion in the area of the My Duc Bridge in the military sub-district of Gang Long.

The report said that two days before this, the liberation armed forces attacked the command post of the Gang Long military sub-district, blew up the My Duc Bridge, and captured the nearby Le Ou outpost. The enemy was extremely frightened and quickly dispatched a main force battalion of the 14th Regiment of the 9th Division to the My Duc Bridge area to defend. However, this enemy force had barely arrived and had not yet stabilized when it was subjected to a devastating attack by the liberation armed forces.

This is the third main force battalion of the enemy that has been annihilated by the liberation armed forces in the Mekong Delta region, following the annihilation of two enemy battalions in the provinces of Tien Giang and Ben Tre.

Twenty-five minutes to destroy twelve enemy vehicles

On the early morning of January 18, the liberation armed forces in the province of Phu Yen in South Vietnam launched a fierce attack on the base of the 38th Armored Battalion of the enemy and part of the 44th Regiment of the 23rd Division. After just twenty-five minutes of heroic fighting, they destroyed twelve M-113 type amphibious armored vehicles, damaged two, and blew up more than forty heavy machine guns. Almost all the enemy soldiers on the vehicles were annihilated.

Another report said that on the night of January 8, the local forces and guerrillas in Chau Doc Province attacked the enemy forces stationed in the "strategic hamlet" of Xom Keo in the district of Go Quao, killing and wounding fifty-five enemy soldiers.

More than four hundred enemy soldiers annihilated in Tuyen Duc and Quang Ngai in ten days

The liberation armed forces in the provinces of Tuyen Duc and Quang Ngai in South Vietnam continued to launch attacks in early January, annihilating a large number of American and puppet troops. The report said that the liberation armed forces in Tuyen Duc Province achieved significant results in the first ten days of January through continuous and heroic fighting. Preliminary statistics show that more than four hundred enemy soldiers were annihilated, most of whom were American invaders. Fifteen enemy vehicles and five enemy aircraft were destroyed, and two were damaged. The local forces and guerrillas in Quang Ngai Province thwarted an enemy "sweep" in two days, January 7 and 8, and continuously attacked enemy outposts, killing and wounding nearly three hundred enemy soldiers, including the annihilation of six enemy platoons.

    一场夜战全歼伪军一主力营
    越南南方茶荣省解放武装力量，一月十九日夜在岗龙军事支区的美德桥地区，全歼伪军一个主力营。
  报道说，在此以前两天，解放武装力量袭击了岗龙军事支区指挥部，炸毁美德桥，并攻克附近的叶欧据点。敌人万分惊恐，急忙将伪军第九师第十四团的一个主力营调到美德桥地区驻扎。但是，这股敌军刚刚开到还未站稳脚跟，就遭到解放武装力量的歼灭性打击。
    这是解放武装力量继在堤岸省芹若县和槟椥省平大县全歼伪军两个营之后，在湄公河三角洲地区全歼的第三个伪军主力营。
    二十五分钟毁敌军车十二辆
    南越平顺省解放武装力量一月十八日凌晨猛烈袭击伪军第三十八装甲营的驻地和伪军第二十三师四十四团的一部，仅经过二十五分钟的英勇战斗，就击毁敌人M—113型两栖装甲车十二辆，击伤两辆，炸毁重机枪四十多挺，车上的伪军几乎全部被歼。
    另据报道，茶荣省地方部队和游击队，一月八日深夜袭击盘踞在构棋县小芹乡“战略村”的伪军，打死打伤敌人五十五名。
    土龙木省十天歼敌四百多名
    越南南方土龙木和广义省解放武装力量一月上旬继续出击，歼灭大批美伪军。报道说，土龙木省解放武装力量在一月份头十天中，连续英勇战斗，取得重大战果。据初步统计，共消灭敌人四百多名，其中大部分是美国侵略军，击毁敌人军车十五辆，击落敌机五架，击伤两架。
    广义省地方部队和游击队在七日和八日两天中，粉碎了敌军的一次“扫荡”，并连续袭击敌军的据点，共打死、打伤敌人近三百名，其中包括全歼伪军六个排。　（据新华社讯）
