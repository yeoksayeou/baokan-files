The editorial board of *Red Flag* magazine: Since January 4 of this year, the *Wenhui Daily* has undergone a complete transformation, becoming a genuine revolutionary newspaper of the proletariat. It has consecutively published many excellent articles and editorials. The one reprinted here, "Long Live the Reason for Revolution and Rebellion," is one of them. This article is excellent! It thoroughly refutes all sorts of bizarre arguments against rebellion, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

Some leaders are not anti-party or anti-socialist elements, but their bourgeois worldview has not been transformed or has not been well transformed. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they neither study nor approach the masses. Therefore, they still do not understand the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to this day, and thus follow the nonsense of "going too far," "too chaotic," "the revolutionary spirit is good, but the specific methods are wrong," and so on. These comrades need to be sternly warned: If you continue this way, you will move from not understanding to opposing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! These comrades must read "Long Live the Reason for Revolution and Rebellion" and reflect on their own thoughts and change their minds. Hope these comrades wake up quickly! Wake up quickly!

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a batch of revolutionary rebels has emerged. Guided by Chairman Mao's teaching that "rebellion is justified," they have raised high the banner of revolutionary rebellion and launched a thunderous attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and on those who stubbornly implement the bourgeois reactionary line. Their momentum is irresistible and swift, and those who follow them prosper while those who resist them perish. This batch of red revolutionary rebels has made indelible historical contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are the vanguards of the Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary rebels have the deepest affection for Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They best understand the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao most supports the revolutionary rebels. They firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. To defend the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to the death, they dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire, fearing neither heaven nor earth, neither ghosts nor gods, neither encirclement nor attacks. With boundless love for Chairman Mao, they dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to venture, dare to rebel, truly achieving "willing to be skinned alive, daring to pull the emperor off his throne."

The revolutionary rebels deeply understand that revolution is not about inviting guests to dine or writing articles; revolution is an uprising, a violent action of one class overthrowing another. For the sake of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they have taken many so-called "transgressive" actions. "Transgression" is revolution! "Transgression" is rebellion! These "transgressive" actions are revolutionary innovations. Every true revolutionary comrade should cheer "excellent" and not follow the nonsense of "terrible."

The revolutionary rebels have the sharpest vision, the most sensitive smell, and the strongest fighting spirit. Under their impact, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, no matter how cleverly they disguise themselves, are one by one exposed; the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, no matter what new forms they adopt to deceive the masses, are all exposed by the revolutionary rebel Red Guards. Under the relentless pursuit of the revolutionary rebels, the days of these stubborn elements are getting worse and worse, and their situation is becoming more and more desperate. If they do not bow their heads in guilt and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, but continue to resist, they will inevitably collapse.

The revolutionary rebels dare to fight, dare to struggle, and dare to rebel, which is the result of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice. The revolutionary rebels have the most outstanding achievements in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They study Chairman Mao's works not by staying in the study, but by learning in the midst of storms and waves, solving the most urgent problems in class struggle. Therefore, they learn a sentence and use it effectively, turning spiritual strength into tremendous material force. In the face of great enemies and numerous difficulties, they learn from Chairman Mao's works and become fearless, daring to go all out. No difficulties or obstacles can overwhelm them; they can only be overwhelmed by the revolutionary rebels.

The revolutionary rebels are at the forefront, encountering various obstacles. These obstacles come in many forms and with different arguments, but they all boil down to one thing: do not rebel. We must thoroughly refute all sorts of bizarre arguments against rebellion.

"Going too far, going too far." This is the view of those who fear. They generally do not support the revolutionary rebels' attacks on the bourgeois reactionary line. They like to make revolution comfortably. In fact, making revolution comfortably is not real revolution. Real revolution is not an easy thing. Making revolution comfortably is false revolution, truly seeking comfort. Whoever wants to make revolution comfortably will comfortably "evolve" into revisionism. Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary things, if you do not attack, they will not fall." Criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line is the same. To correct a deviation, one must go to the opposite extreme; without going to the opposite extreme, one cannot correct the deviation. Without a fierce attack on the bourgeois reactionary line, without a sharp battle, the bourgeois reactionary line will not easily retreat from the minds of its executors. We must shout loudly and fearlessly "going too far."

"You are making too much trouble." What are you afraid of! Chairman Mao said: "Even great storms and waves are not to be feared. Human society has developed through great storms and waves." Under today's conditions, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, promoting great democracy will only strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and will never weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat. Smashing the rules and regulations that bind the masses, smashing the strange old frameworks, and fully mobilizing the masses is a great thing. Revolution is not a crime, and rebellion is justified. We must not repeat the mistake of the Leopard King again. Every day we call for mobilizing the masses, but when the masses are truly mobilized, we panic and are terrified, isn't this repeating the mistake of the Leopard King? The great chaos of revolution is excellent. The result of the great chaos of revolution is that only all rotten things will be lost, and in the struggle we will learn more Mao Zedong Thought.

"The revolutionary spirit is good, but the specific methods cannot be agreed upon." This is another compromise proposal. The revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary rebels is always embodied in one specific action after another. Since you support the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary rebels, but criticize every specific revolutionary action, then your "support" and "agreement" will all be in vain! On the one hand, you affirm the revolutionary spirit, and on the other hand, you oppose revolutionary actions, how can the two be unified? The revolutionary rebels may have this or that flaw in the struggle, which is inevitable. Whoever wants to seize their individual flaws to attack the revolutionary rebels, whoever wants to fish for half a stalk of rice from this, will definitely not have a good ending. Toward the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebels, either actively support or firmly oppose, the path of compromise is absolutely not feasible.

"Rebellion is justified." This slogan will forever be the slogan of proletarian revolutionaries. Whether you are a true Marxist or a false Marxist, how you treat this slogan, with what attitude you treat the revolutionary rebels, is the touchstone to test them. If you are a true Marxist, you will undoubtedly believe without reservation that "rebellion is justified," you will undoubtedly put "revolution" first; if you are a false Marxist, you will undoubtedly believe without reservation that "rebellion is unjustified," you will undoubtedly put "protection" first. The spirit of the times today is the spirit of revolutionary rebellion. Every true revolutionary, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, should raise high the banner of revolutionary rebellion and be proud to be a revolutionary rebel!

Comrades of the revolutionary rebels, looking ahead to the new year, the situation is excellent, and the tasks are arduous. Let us raise higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study the "Three Articles" as our motto, grasp the transformation of our worldview, break down the "self" and establish the "public"; go to the factories, go to the countryside, and integrate with the broad masses of workers and peasants; in any situation, stay closely united, continue the fight, revolutionize to the end, advance toward higher goals, and win one victory after another!

    革命造反有理万岁
    上海《文汇报》一月六日社论
    《红旗》杂志的编者按：《文汇报》从今年一月四日以来，面貌焕然一新，成了一张真正的无产阶级的革命的报纸。它连续发表了许多好文章和好社论，本刊转载的《革命造反有理万岁》就是其中的一篇。这篇文章好得很！它把那些形形色色的不准造反的奇谈怪论痛加驳斥，大长了无产阶级革命造反派的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。
    有些负责人，他们不是反党反社会主义分子，但资产阶级世界观没有得到改造或没有改造好。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们既不学习，又不接近群众。因此，他们直到今天对无产阶级文化大革命还很不理解，于是就跟着瞎说“过头了”，“太乱了”，“革命精神是好的，具体做法不对”等等。应该向这些同志大喝一声：这样下去就要从不理解走到对抗无产阶级文化大革命！这些同志，极有必要读一读《革命造反有理万岁》这篇文章，照照自己的思想，换一换脑筋。希望这些同志，赶快猛醒！赶快猛醒！
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，杀出了一批革命造反派。他们根据毛主席“造反有理”的教导，高高举起革命造反的大旗，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，向那些顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线的人物，发起了急风暴雨式的总攻击。其势锐不可当，迅猛异常，顺之者昌，逆之者亡。这批红色革命造反派，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，立下了不可磨灭的历史功勋。他们是文化大革命的急先锋。
    革命造反派，对毛主席和党中央感情最深厚。他们最理解毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，毛主席最支持革命造反派。他们坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的革命路线一边。为了誓死捍卫党中央，誓死捍卫毛主席，他们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，神不怕，围攻不怕，打击不怕。他们怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，敢想，敢说，敢干，敢闯，敢革命，真正做到了“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”。
    革命造反派，深深地懂得，革命不是请客吃饭，不是做文章；革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。他们为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，作出了许多所谓“越轨”行动。“越轨”就是革命！“越轨”就是造反！这些“越轨”行动，是革命的创举。每一个真正革命的同志，都应该欢呼“好得很”，而不应该跟着瞎说“糟得很”。
    革命造反派，他们的目光最锐利，嗅觉最灵敏，斗志最旺盛。在他们的冲击下，一小撮躲在阴暗角落里的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，无论伪装得怎样巧妙，还是一个一个地被他们揪出来了；极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，不论采取什么新的形式来欺骗群众，都一一被革命造反的红卫兵小将们识破了。在革命造反派的穷追猛打之下，那批顽固分子的日子越来越不好过，处境越来越狼狈。他们如果不低头认罪，不回到毛主席的革命路线上来，而继续顽抗下去，则非垮台不可。
    革命造反派，他们敢打敢拚敢造反，是活学活用毛主席著作的结果。革命造反派活学活用毛主席著作最有成绩。他们学习毛主席著作，不是关在书斋里学，而是在大风大浪中学，带着阶级斗争中最迫切需要解决的问题学，因而学一句，顶一句用，精神力量化作了巨大的物质力量。在大敌当前、困难重重时，他们学了毛主席著作，就浑身是胆，敢于豁出去，任何困难、阻力都压不倒他们，而只能被革命造反派所压倒。
    革命造反派冲在前头，遇到了种种阻力。这些阻力，花样不少，说法不一，但万变不离其宗，就是一句话：不准造反。我们必须把那些形形色色的不准造反的奇谈怪论痛加驳斥。
    “过头了，过头了。”这是一种怕字派的意见。他们一概不赞成革命造反派对资产阶级反动路线的冲击。他们喜欢舒舒服服地闹革命。其实，舒舒服服是闹不成革命的。革命是一件不容易的事情。舒舒服服地闹革命是假革命，真想舒服。谁想舒舒服服地闹革命，谁就会舒舒服服地“演变”成为修正主义。毛主席说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”批判资产阶级反动路线亦是这样。矫枉必须过正，不过正不能矫枉。没有对资产阶级反动路线的剧烈的冲击，没有一场尖锐的决战，资产阶级反动路线是不会轻易地从执行者的头脑里退走的。我们就是要大喊大叫，就是不怕“过头”。
    “这样搞法太乱了。”你怕什么！毛主席说：“大风大浪也不可怕。人类社会就是从大风大浪中发展起来的。”在今天的条件下，在毛泽东思想指导下，发扬大民主，只会巩固无产阶级专政，而决不会削弱无产阶级专政。打掉那些束缚群众手脚的清规戒律，打掉那些千奇百怪的旧框框，把群众充分发动起来，这是一件大好的事情。革命就是无罪，造反就是有理。我们再不要重犯叶公好龙的错误了。天天在叫发动群众，当群众真正发动起来了，又惊惶失措，怕得要命，这不是重犯叶公好龙的错误吗？革命的大乱好得很。革命的大乱的结果，失去的只会是一切腐朽的东西，而在斗争中我们却能学到更多的毛泽东思想。
    “革命精神是好的，具体做法不能同意。”这又是一种折衷主义的提法。革命造反派的革命造反精神，总是通过一个一个具体行动体现出来的。你既然支持革命造反派的革命精神，但对每一个具体革命行动却又百般指责，这样，你的“支持”、“赞成”，岂不一一落空了吗？！一面肯定革命精神，一面又反对革命行动，两者怎么能够统一起来呢？造反派在斗争中，可能会有这样那样的缺点，这也是难免的。谁想抓住他们的某些个别缺点来攻击革命造反派，谁想从中捞取半根稻草，肯定是不会有好下场的。对待革命造反派的革命行动，要末积极支持，要末坚决反对，折衷主义这条路决然走不通。
    “造反有理”。这个口号永远是无产阶级革命家的口号。是真马克思主义者，还是假马克思主义者，如何对待这个口号，以什么态度对待革命造反派，这是检验他们的试金石。你是一个真马克思主义者，你就一定会不折不扣地认为“造反有理”，你就一定是“革”字当头；你是一个假马克思主义者，你就一定会不折不扣地认为“造反无理”，你就一定是“保”字当头。当今时代的时代精神，就是革命造反精神。每一个真正的革命者，在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，都要高举起革命造反的大旗，以当一个革命造反派而自豪！
    革命造反派的战友们，展望新的一年，形势大好，任务艰巨。让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，狠抓世界观的改造，大破“私”字，大立“公”字；到工厂去，到农村去，实行和广大工农群众相结合；在任何情况下紧密团结，继续战斗，革命到底，向着更高的目标前进，夺取一个又一个新胜利！
