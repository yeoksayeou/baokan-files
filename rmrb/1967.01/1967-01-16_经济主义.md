Economicism

Economicism is anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. It is a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Economicism caters to the backward psychology of some of the masses, using economic bribery to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, leading the masses' political struggles onto the path of economicism. In other words, it wants the proletariat to struggle only for a slight increase in wages and benefits, to care only for personal temporary interests, and not for the long-term and fundamental interests of the entire proletariat. It does not engage in political struggles to realize socialism and communism. In short, it advocates for money being in command, not politics.

Under the capitalist system, economicism is a tool to maintain the reactionary capitalist rule and oppose the proletarian revolution. Before the October Revolution, there was a revisionist faction in Russia called the "Economists." They believed that the main task of workers was to engage in economic struggles with capitalists, demanding increased wages and improved working conditions, rather than engaging in political struggles to overthrow the entire capitalist system. They advocated that the working class could spontaneously enter socialism through economic struggles. Lenin had firmly criticized this revisionist fallacy. Lenin pointed out that according to the methods of economicism, the capitalist system could never be overthrown, and workers could only forever be slaves to capitalists. He believed that the task of the Communist Party was to instill Marxism in workers, raise their class consciousness, and consciously engage in proletarian revolution to overthrow the capitalist system.

Economicism is even more reactionary under the socialist system. It is a tool for the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. Modern revisionists, with Khrushchev as their representative, are frantically advocating and promoting economicism. They deny the class struggle and the necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat in socialist society. They advocate material incentives and proclaim that money is in command. They strive to lure people into pursuing personal economic interests, allowing bourgeois ideology to spread freely, in order to undermine the socialist system and lead the Soviet Union onto the path of capitalist restoration.

Currently, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is achieving brilliant victories. A small handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line have already begun to collapse completely. However, they are not willing to accept their own destruction and are making desperate struggles. They have picked up this piece of junk from the new and old revisionist garbage heap, attempting to use it to launch a new counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary line, attempting to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and undermine the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system.

Now, their plots have been exposed. Workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres across the country are uniting to oppose economicism and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

    经济主义
    经济主义是反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的，是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义的货色。
    经济主义迎合部分群众的落后心理，用经济收买的手段，腐蚀群众的革命意志，把群众的政治斗争引向经济主义的道路。就是说，它要无产阶级只为增加一点工资福利而斗争，只顾个人的暂时利益，不顾整个无产阶级的长远的根本的利益，不去为实现社会主义和共产主义而进行政治斗争。也就是我们常说的：只要钞票挂帅，不要政治挂帅。
    在资本主义制度下，经济主义是维护资本主义反动统治、反对无产阶级革命的工具。早在十月革命以前，俄国有一个修正主义派别叫“经济派”。他们认为工人的主要任务就是跟资本家进行经济斗争，要求增加工资，改良劳动条件；而不是去进行政治斗争，去推翻整个资本主义制度。他们宣扬工人阶级通过经济斗争就可以自发地进入社会主义。列宁曾经坚决批判过这种修正主义谬论。列宁指出，按照经济主义的办法，资本主义制度永远不能推翻，工人只能永远当资本家的奴隶。他认为，共产党的任务是要向工人灌输马克思主义，提高工人的阶级觉悟，自觉地起来进行无产阶级革命，推翻资本主义制度。
    经济主义在社会主义制度下更加反动。它是资本主义反革命复辟的工具。以赫鲁晓夫为代表的现代修正主义者就在拚命地宣扬和推行经济主义。他们抹杀社会主义社会的阶级和阶级斗争，否认无产阶级专政的必要性。他们鼓吹物质刺激，宣扬钞票挂帅。他们竭力引诱人们去追求个人的经济利益，使资产阶级思想自由泛滥，以破坏社会主义制度，使苏联走上资本主义复辟的道路。
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命正在取得辉煌胜利，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，已经开始全线崩溃。但是，他们还不甘心自己的灭亡，还要作垂死挣扎。他们从新、老修正主义的垃圾堆里拣来了经济主义这个破烂货，妄图用它来向无产阶级革命路线进行新反扑，妄图扼杀无产阶级文化大革命，瓦解无产阶级专政和社会主义制度。
    现在，他们的阴谋已经被揭发出来了。全国的工人、农民、革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部正在联合起来，反对经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
