The Shanghai *Liberation Daily* editorial of January 20th

The Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Shanghai Workers and the Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Shanghai Peasants, along with other revolutionary rebel organizations, have issued a *Declaration to the People of Shanghai* regarding the revolutionary peasant movement in the suburbs of Shanghai. This is a very important document. It delivers a powerful blow to the new counterattack of the capitalist roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Committee. It will play a significant role in promoting the development of the revolutionary peasant movement in the suburbs of Shanghai.

Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the more than three million peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai, with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the core, have risen up with the momentum of a surging tide and the force of thunder. They are fiercely rebelling against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the capitalist reactionary line. This is a new and important sign that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Shanghai region is developing better and better. The broad participation of revolutionary peasants in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will certainly overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the countryside, thoroughly smash the capitalist reactionary line, uproot the seeds of capitalism and revisionism, and promote the thought revolutionization of the broad peasantry. The rise of the revolutionary peasant movement will inevitably make the mass movement more extensive and the struggle more profound, thus greatly promoting the rapid development of the entire Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the vigorous rise of the revolutionary peasant movement is a matter of great significance in the Shanghai region. We warmly hail the rise of the revolutionary peasant movement in the suburbs of Shanghai! The revolutionary peasants' great direction is completely correct, and their revolutionary actions are excellent! Excellent! We will always firmly stand by their side and resolutely support their revolutionary actions!

The revolutionary peasant movement in the suburbs of Shanghai has formed a powerful force since its inception, fiercely attacking the rural strongholds that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Committee have attempted to defend. Revolutionary peasants have keenly exposed the tricks and conspiracies of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and those who stubbornly adhere to the capitalist reactionary line, and have given a resolute counterattack to the counter-revolutionary economic wind that has just emerged in the countryside. Counter-revolutionary economicism is a corrosive agent for the revolutionary peasant movement. The handful of scoundrels within the Shanghai Municipal Committee, unwilling to accept their defeat, attempt to pick up this piece of trash to create contradictions, widen differences, incite opposition between workers and peasants, and destroy the worker-peasant alliance and the socialist economic foundation of the countryside. What is particularly alarming is that they try to incite a large number of community members who do not understand the truth to leave their production posts and rush to the cities, aiming to disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and agricultural production. They are eager to lead the revolutionary peasant movement, which has just arisen, into the wrong path of counter-revolutionary economicism, strangle the revolutionary peasant movement in its cradle, and their intentions are extremely malicious! However, the peasant revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be defeated by sugar-coated bullets, deceived by sweet words, or overthrown by tricks! They are models in implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." They have now risen up to launch a fierce attack on counter-revolutionary economicism, fully demonstrating the great power of the main force of the Cultural Revolution, fully showing that revolutionary peasants can liberate themselves, educate themselves, and rise up in revolution. They will certainly sweep away all the counter-revolutionary economicist winds, thoroughly repel the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, and make the revolutionary peasant movement advance healthily and victoriously along the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao.

The joint action of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Shanghai Workers, the Preparatory Committee of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Shanghai Peasants, and other revolutionary rebel organizations, and the issuance of this very important document, *Declaration to the People of Shanghai*, marks the rapid union of the revolutionary worker movement, the revolutionary student movement, and the revolutionary peasant movement in the Shanghai region, forming an irresistible revolutionary torrent. With the momentum of "sweeping away thousands of troops like rolling up a mat," they launch a general offensive against the capitalist reactionary line. As Chairman Mao teaches: "All the intellectual youth and student youth in the country must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and become one with them, to form a powerful army. This is an army of tens of millions! With this great army, we can attack and capture the enemy's strongholds, and attack and capture the enemy's last bastion." We believe that revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, with organization and planning, will go to factories and countryside, unite with the masses of workers and peasants, which will certainly bring about a new situation of great unity and great alliance among workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, and will certainly bring about a new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Shanghai region.

The rise of the revolutionary peasant movement in the suburbs of Shanghai, and the great unity of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, have sounded the death knell for the capitalist reactionary line. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." At this critical moment of the struggle between the two lines, let us, all revolutionary comrades of the proletariat, unite more closely, seize victory, and decisively, thoroughly, and completely smash all the reactionary fortresses occupied by the capitalist reactionary line of the Shanghai Municipal Committee. Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the sky of Shanghai!

    热烈欢呼革命农民投入无产阶级文化大革命运动
　　上海《解放日报》一月二十日社论
    上海工人革命造反总司令部、上海农民革命造反总司令部筹备委员会等革命造反组织，就上海郊区革命农民运动所发表的《告上海全市人民书》是一个十分重要的文件。它给了上海市委资产阶级反动路线的新反扑又一个猛烈的反击。它对上海郊区革命农民运动的发展将起到一个重大的推动作用。
    在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，上海郊区以贫下中农为核心，三百多万农民纷纷起来，以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造地、富、反、坏、右的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，这是上海地区无产阶级文化大革命形势越来越好的一个新的重要标志。革命农民广泛投入无产阶级文化大革命运动，必将斗垮农村中党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底摧毁资产阶级反动路线，铲除资本主义和修正主义的根苗，促进广大农民思想革命化。革命农民运动的兴起必然使群众运动规模更大，斗争更加深入，从而极大地推动整个无产阶级文化大革命迅猛地向前发展。因此，革命农民运动的蓬勃兴起，是上海地区一件意义十分重大的大事。我们热烈欢呼上海郊区革命农民运动的兴起！革命农民的大方向是完全正确的，他们的革命行动好得很！好极了！我们将始终坚定地站在他们一边，坚决支持他们的革命行动！
    上海郊区革命农民运动一出现，就形成了一股强大的力量，猛烈冲击着上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所企图固守的农村阵地。革命农民敏锐地识破了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的阴谋诡计，给刚刚在农村露头的反革命经济主义黑风以坚决反击。反革命经济主义，是革命农民运动的腐蚀剂。上海市委内的一小撮混蛋老爷们，他们不甘心自己的失败，妄图拾起反革命经济主义这个破烂，来制造矛盾，扩大差别，挑起工人与农民之间的对立，破坏工农联盟，破坏农村社会主义经济基础。特别值得警惕的是，他们企图唆使大批不明真相的社员群众离开生产岗位，涌向城市，以达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命和破坏农业生产的目的。他们竭力要在革命农民运动刚刚兴起之时，就把它引入反革命经济主义的歧途，扼杀革命农民运动于摇篮之中，用心何其毒也！但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的农民革命造反派，是糖衣炮弹打不倒，甜言蜜语骗不了，阴谋诡计搞不垮的！他们是贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的模范。他们现在已经起来向反革命经济主义猛烈开火，充分显示了文化大革命主力军的伟大力量，充分表明了革命农民完全能够自己解放自己，自己教育自己，自己起来闹革命。他们一定能够横扫一切反革命经济主义的妖风，彻底击退上海市委资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，使革命农民运动沿着毛主席指引的正确方向健康地胜利地前进。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部、上海农民革命造反总司令部筹备委员会等革命造反组织联合行动，发表《告上海全市人民书》这个十分重要的文件，标志着上海地区革命工人运动，革命学生运动，正在迅速地与革命农民运动联合起来，汇成一股锐不可挡的革命洪流，以“横扫千军如卷席”之势，向资产阶级反动路线发动总攻击。正如毛主席教导的：“全国知识青年和学生青年一定要和广大的工农群众结合在一块，和他们变成一体，才能形成一支强有力的军队。这是一支几万万人的军队呵！有了这支大军，才能攻破敌人的坚固阵地，才能攻破敌人的最后堡垒。”我们相信，革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部有组织有计划地下厂下乡，与工农群众相结合，必然会使工人、农民、革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部的大联合大团结出现一个崭新的局面，必然会使上海地区无产阶级文化大革命出现一个崭新的局面。
    上海郊区革命农民运动的兴起，工人、贫下中农、革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部的大联合，敲响了资产阶级反动路线大崩溃的丧钟。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。在当前两条路线斗争进入关键的时刻，让我们一切无产阶级革命派进一步紧密团结起来，乘胜追击，把上海市委资产阶级反动路线所盘踞的一切反动堡垒，坚决、彻底、全部地摧毁轰垮，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在上海上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
