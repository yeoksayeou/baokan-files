Japanese friends praise China's Cultural Revolution for boosting world revolutionary people's confidence

Revolutionary rebels seize power successfully

According to Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong, January 25th, the General Secretary of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Headquarters, Sanjiao Yiri, recently said to reporters here that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing victoriously along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, which greatly inspires the Japanese people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and strengthens the confidence of the world's revolutionary people in their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle and in their struggle for liberation. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has entered a broader and deeper new stage, and the situation is developing very well. Seven hundred million Chinese people are full of confidence, determined to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely to carry out the revolution and production better, and to realize Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production."

He said that workers, peasants, students, cadres, and other revolutionary masses across China are firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, uniting under the banner of proletarian revolution, thoroughly repelling the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, seizing political power, economic power, and cultural power, and putting them all in their own hands, further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensuring that the country will never change color. He said that due to the great significance and far-reaching influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries are terrified. The more deeply China carries out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the more terrified the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries become.

Sanjiao Yiri pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is indeed an unprecedented great revolution, a fierce class struggle, a revolution in which the proletariat seeks to eliminate the bourgeoisie. This great revolution not only has a profound impact on China's future but also makes a tremendous contribution to the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.

　　日本朋友赞扬中国文化大革命增强了世界革命人民信心
　　革命造反派夺权夺得对夺得好
    据新华社香港二十五日电　日中友好协会（正统）总部常任理事兼事务局长三好一日前在这里对记者发表访华观感说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命正沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进，这给予日本人民、越南人民和亚非拉各国人民无比的鼓舞，并加强了世界革命人民的反帝反修斗争和争取解放的信心。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命已进入一个更广阔、更深入的新阶段，形势的发展好得很。七亿中国人民满怀信心，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，坚决要把革命和生产搞得更好，实现毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。
    他说，中国全国革命的工人、农民、学生、干部和其他革命的群众，都坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的一边，在无产阶级革命造反的大旗下联合起来，彻底打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把政治的权力，经济的权力，文化的权力，统统要夺过来，掌握在自己的手里，更进一步巩固无产阶级专政，使国家永不变色。他说，由于中国无产阶级文化大革命的意义重大，影响深远，使美帝、苏修和各国反动派害怕得要死。中国把无产阶级文化大革命搞得越深，美帝、苏修和各国反动派就越害怕得厉害。
    三好一指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命确是一场史无前例的伟大的革命，是一场激烈的阶级斗争，是无产阶级要消灭资产阶级的革命。这场大革命不仅对中国的将来产生深远的影响，并对全世界人民的革命事业作出了巨大的贡献。
