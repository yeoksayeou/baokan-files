In San Francisco, Chinese doctors successfully reattach the nearly severed hand of an elderly worker from Zanzibar.

NEW YORK, January 16 — Chinese surgeons working in Zanzibar recently successfully reattached the nearly completely severed hand of an elderly Zanzibar worker, Shaban Hamisi. The good news quickly spread throughout Tanzania, and people praised the Chinese doctors armed with Mao Zedong Thought for their outstanding achievements for the African people.

In mid-May last year, Shaban Hamisi was seriously injured by a shredder in a coconut fiber factory in Dole, central Zanzibar. His left forearm was severely crushed, and his left hand was only connected to his arm by a small piece of skin and flesh. His colleagues immediately sent him to the "Lenin Hospital." By the time he was placed on the operating table, Shaban Hamisi had already lost consciousness.

Chinese surgeons Zhou Zhiyao and Dai Chuanxiao carefully examined the injured hand: two arm bones were fractured and missing pieces; muscles, tendons, blood vessels, and nerves were severed, with only one artery and one nerve intact. This nearly completely severed hand was only connected to the forearm by a small piece of skin. For such a severe crushing injury, due to the large wound and the risk of infection, the usual procedure is amputation.

At this critical moment, the Chinese doctors remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people" and decided to do their utmost to save the African worker's hand, preventing their class brother from becoming disabled for life. Other members of the Chinese medical team, upon learning of this severe case, also rushed to assist.

Over the past half year, the Chinese doctors successfully performed five surgeries on Shaban Hamisi, including suturing, skin grafting, and bone grafting. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "In strategy, we must despise all enemies; in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously." During the treatment process, they paid special attention to cleaning the wound, removing damaged tissue, and providing meticulous care, successfully controlling the infection. They personally changed Shaban Hamisi's dressings and constantly observed his condition day and night.

Shaban Hamisi was recently discharged from the hospital. He can now use his left hand to hold food, dress himself, carry bags, and do some light work. He gratefully told the Chinese doctors, "I am very grateful to you, the doctors sent by Chairman Mao!"

A medical worker from Zanzibar praised the Chinese doctors, saying, "I have worked in the operating room for eighteen years and have never seen such a surgery. During the colonial rule, even for less severe hand and foot injuries, the only solution was amputation."

The Tanganyika Federation of Labor Unions issued a statement in Dar es Salaam on December 23 last year, praising "the outstanding work of Chinese surgeons who successfully performed a miraculous operation."

The statement exclaimed: "Long live the friendship between the workers and peasants of the United Republic of Tanzania and the workers and peasants of the People's Republic of China!"

### 用毛泽东思想武装起来就无往不胜  我国医生为桑给巴尔老工人接活断手

    用毛泽东思想武装起来就无往不胜
    我国医生为桑给巴尔老工人接活断手
    新华社桑给巴尔十六日电　在桑给巴尔工作的中国外科医生最近成功地为桑给巴尔老工人夏班·哈米西接活了一只几乎完全被轧断的手。这个喜讯很快在坦桑尼亚传播开来，人们赞扬用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国医生为非洲人民作出了出色的成绩。
    去年五月中旬的一天，夏班·哈米西在桑给巴尔中部多勒一家椰子纤维厂里被粉碎器严重轧伤了左前臂，左手同手臂只连着一点皮肉，他的同事们立即把他送到“列宁医院”。躺到手术台上时，夏班·哈米西已经神志昏迷。
    中国外科医生周志耀、戴传孝仔细检查了伤手：两根臂骨折断，有缺损；肌肉、腱、血管和神经被轧断了，只有一根动脉和一根神经没有断，这只几乎全断的手同前臂只连着一小块皮肉。对于这样严重的粉碎性轧伤，由于伤口大，容易感染，通常的办法是施行截肢手术。
    在这个时候，中国医生想到了伟大领袖毛主席的“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导，决心尽最大努力接活这位非洲工人兄弟的手，不让这位阶级弟兄终生残废。中国医疗队的其他成员在知道这一严重的病例以后，也赶来帮助。
    半年多来，中国医生成功地为夏班·哈米西作了缝合、植皮、植骨等五次手术。他们牢记毛主席关于“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的这一教导，在治疗过程中，特别注意清洗伤口，切除损坏的组织，精心护理，成功地控制了感染。他们亲自为夏班·哈米西换药，并且日日夜夜地经常观察。
    夏班·哈米西不久前已经出院。他现在已经能够用他的左手拿食物，穿衣服，提袋子，并做一些轻便的工作了。他十分感激地对中国医生说：“非常感激你们，毛主席派来的中国医生！”
    桑给巴尔一位医务人员赞扬中国医生说：“我在手术室工作了十八年，从来没有见过这样的手术。在殖民统治时代，遇到比这还轻的手足外伤，除了用截肢刀，就没有别的办法了。”
    坦噶尼喀全国工人联合会去年十二月二十三日在达累斯萨拉姆发表新闻公报，赞扬“中国外科医生做出了出色的工作，成功地进行了一次奇迹般的手术”。
    公报欢呼：“坦桑尼亚联合共和国的工农同中华人民共和国的工农友好万岁！”
