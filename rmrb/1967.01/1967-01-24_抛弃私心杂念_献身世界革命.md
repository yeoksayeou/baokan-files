Title: Abandon Selfish Thoughts and Dedicate Oneself to the World Revolution

On the evening of December 24 last year, as I was reciting Mao Zedong's poems and verses with boundless respect and excitement, Comrade Ke Ming suddenly walked in, excitedly saying, "Beijing has sent us 'Quotations from Chairman Mao'!"

The red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" illuminated my eyes and warmed my heart. I couldn't help but exclaim, "The treasure book has arrived! It has strengthened our invincible force in resisting America and saving the country!"

"This is a spiritual atomic bomb!" Ke Ming pressed the treasure book to his chest and said word by word.

My younger sister, who was sleeping sweetly, woke up with a start. She jumped out of bed and snatched the book from Ke Ming's hands.

The three of us wiped the already clean table together and placed the book in the center. I turned the pages one by one and read aloud. When I turned to page 150, the words "patriotism and internationalism" leaped into my eyes, and my heart felt warm. I read, "A foreigner, without any selfish motive, regards the liberation of the Chinese people as his own cause. What kind of spirit is this? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism..." I was greatly educated and inspired.

Dr. Norman Bethune's spirit of "selflessness and dedication to others," and his selfless internationalism, dedicating himself to the world revolution, are truly admirable!

Reading Chairman Mao's quotations, I immediately thought, as a Vietnamese Chinese, how should I dedicate everything I have to the front line of the world's anti-American struggle? Chairman Mao said, "Can an internationalist communist party member also be a patriot? We believe not only can he be, but he must be."

This is the truth! We overseas Chinese should also hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and Chairman Ho, stand shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people, and fight together to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors. This is not only for our own happiness and to defend our motherland but also to support the revolutionary cause of oppressed nations and peoples around the world!

I shared my thoughts with Ke Ming and my younger sister, and they both agreed unanimously. At this moment, Ke Ming raised the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high and shouted excitedly:

"Long live the outstanding leader of the contemporary proletarian revolution, Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

"We vow to stand together with the Vietnamese people and fight to the end, thoroughly and completely annihilate the American aggressors!"

### 抛弃私心杂念　献身世界革命

　　抛弃私心杂念　献身世界革命
　　越南华侨　陈文
    去年十二月二十四日晚上，当我正以无限崇敬和激动的心情朗诵毛主席诗词的时候，克明同志突然走进来，兴奋地说：“北京送来了《毛主席语录》！”
    红彤彤的《毛主席语录》照亮了我的眼睛，烘暖了我的心田。我不禁欢呼：“宝书来了。它增强了我们抗美救国的战无不胜的力量！”
    “这是精神原子弹！”克明把宝书按在胸口，一字一句的说。
    正在甜睡的妹妹被惊醒了，她从床上一跃而起，从克明手中夺去宝书。
    我们三个一齐揩了本来已经干净的桌子，把宝书放在正中。我一页一页地翻开语录高声朗读。当翻到一百五十页， “爱国主义和国际主义”这几个字跃进我的眼里，我的心感到热烘烘的。我读到“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，……”时，我受到很大的教育和激励。
    白求恩的“毫不利己专门利人”、“毫无自私自利之心”的共产主义精神，毫无私心杂念和以世界革命为己任的崇高国际主义精神多么可佩！
    读了毛主席上述的语录，我立刻联想到，作为一个越南华侨，我应该怎样把自己的一切贡献于世界反美斗争的最前线？毛主席说：“国际主义者的共产党员，是否可以同时又是一个爱国主义者呢？我们认为不但是可以的，而且是应该的。”
    这是真理！我们华侨也要高举毛泽东思想红旗，在越南劳动党、胡主席的领导下与兄弟的越南人民并肩团结战斗，彻底打败美国侵略强盗，不但是为了本身的幸福，为了捍卫祖国，同时也是为了支援世界上被压迫民族和人民的革命事业！
    我把我的体会告知克明和妹妹，他们都一致表示同意。这时，克明高高举起《毛主席语录》激动地高呼：
      “祝当代无产阶级革命杰出的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
      “誓与兄弟的越南人民团结战斗到底，彻底、干净消灭美国侵略强盗！”
