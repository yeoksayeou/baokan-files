Albanian people in various places continue to hold rallies, enthusiastically cheering on the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and other revolutionary mass organizations as they raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve brilliant victories in the struggle against the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. They express their most sincere and fervent congratulations to them for raising even higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advancing in victory, and achieving greater victories, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The workers in Tirana, Gjirokastra, Korca, Lushnje, Berat, Elbasan, Vlorë, Durrës, and Shkodër and other cities, after reading in the newspapers the letter of thanks from the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and other revolutionary mass organizations to the Albanian working class, were greatly inspired. They warmly praised the great victories achieved by the Shanghai revolutionary workers and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live the unbreakable combat unity and revolutionary friendship between Albania and China!"

The workers of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory held a meeting on the 21st, listening with great emotion to the letter of thanks from the Shanghai revolutionary rebels to the Albanian working class and other materials related to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The workers attending the meeting repeatedly shouted, "Long live the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong's eternal life!" Worker Zulufo said excitedly, "The Shanghai revolutionary workers are good soldiers of Chairman Mao Zedong. They have dealt a crushing blow to the bourgeois reactionary line, defending the victory fruits and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The victory of the Shanghai revolutionary workers is a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership."

At the meeting in the "Joseph Pashko" Building Materials Factory in Tirana, many workers spoke, pointing out that the revolutionary actions taken by the Shanghai workers in defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao Zedong and blocking all channels for the production of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism are a great inspiration to all revolutionary forces in the world.

The workers of the state-owned automobile transport company in Elbasan held a grand meeting on the 21st. The team leader of the fourth production team, Jo. Boga, said that the Shanghai workers with a glorious revolutionary tradition have shown high revolutionary spirit in the struggle to smash the bourgeois reactionary line. They bravely and resolutely opposed the enemies who sabotaged the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism. Their brave and firm spirit in defending Mao Zedong Thought and Marxist-Leninist principles is a lofty example.

The workers of the state-owned automobile transport company in Lushnje enthusiastically shouted at the meeting, "Long live the great leader of the Chinese people and the greatest friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao Zedong!" Worker Lin Xi spoke at the meeting, saying, "The working people of China are united as one around their most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, and will surely break through all difficulties and obstacles, march forward forever, further strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and raise the prestige of the brotherly People's Republic of China higher and higher."

The workers of the Lushnje Phosphorus Fertilizer Factory, in a letter passed at their meeting, said, "We will always support the heroic struggle of the revolutionary workers of brotherly China. Your struggle and victory also inspire us to achieve new victories. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is unfolding victoriously in China, has great significance for the future of the Chinese people and the people of the world, because People's China today is a bastion of socialism and world revolution, a strong and reliable defender of the liberation and revolution of the peoples of all countries. The friendship between our two peoples, forged by the Marxist-Leninist parties of our two countries and our beloved leaders Enver Hoxha and Mao Zedong, is an eternal revolutionary friendship. In the struggle against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist traitor leadership, and for the victory of revolution and socialism, we will forever march shoulder to shoulder with you."

The workers of the Gjirokastra Metal Factory read the letter of thanks from the Shanghai revolutionary mass organizations to the Albanian working class at their meeting. Worker Manga said enthusiastically at the meeting, "Mao Zedong Thought is a shining beacon for the great Chinese people on the road to victory of socialism and communism. The victory and development of Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution make the imperialists and revisionists howl and fume with rage, because Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have foiled their plans and dashed their hopes of changing the color of the People's Republic of China."

Worker Qingu of the Kucove Copper Smelting Factory spoke at the factory meeting, warmly congratulating the revolutionary measures taken by the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and other revolutionary mass organizations. He expressed that in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership, he will always stand in the same trench with the revolutionaries of Shanghai and all the people of China.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民继续集会欢呼上海革命造反派乘胜前进
　　上海革命造反派是毛主席的好战士
　　上海革命工人的革命行动是对全世界所有革命力量的巨大鼓舞
    新华社地拉那二十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚各地群众继续举行集会，热烈欢呼上海工人革命造反总司令部和其他革命群众组织高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在反击资产阶级反动路线新反扑的斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利，表示最衷心、最热烈地祝贺他们更高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进，夺取更大的胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    地拉那、吉诺卡斯特、科尔察、卢卑克、培拉特、爱尔巴桑、发罗拉、都拉斯和斯库台等十几个城市的职工，从报纸上看到上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命群众组织给阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级的感谢信以后，受到极大鼓舞。他们热烈赞扬上海革命工人取得的伟大胜利，并热情高呼“毛泽东主席万岁！”“阿中牢不可破的战斗团结和革命友谊万岁！”
    地拉那拖拉机配件厂的职工二十一日集会，怀着十分激动的心情听取上海工人革命造反派给阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级的感谢信和其它有关中国无产阶级文化大革命的材料。参加集会的职工不断高呼：“杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席万岁！”“祝毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”工人祖鲁博激动地说：“上海革命工人是毛泽东主席的好战士，他们给了资产阶级反动路线以毁灭性打击，保卫了胜利果实和无产阶级专政。上海革命工人的胜利是对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共修正主义领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的沉重打击。”
    在地拉那“约瑟夫·帕施柯”建筑材料工厂的集会上，许多职工发言指出，上海工人在保卫以毛泽东主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线、堵塞产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的一切渠道的英勇斗争中所采取的革命行动，是对全世界所有革命力量的巨大鼓舞。
    爱尔巴桑国营汽车运输公司的职工二十一日举行了大会。第四生产队队长约·博加说，具有光荣革命传统的上海工人在粉碎资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，表现了高度的革命精神。他们勇敢并坚决地反对了破坏无产阶级专政和社会主义的敌人。他们捍卫毛泽东思想、捍卫马克思列宁主义原则的勇敢和坚定精神，是一个崇高的榜样。
    拉齐国营汽车运输公司的职工们在集会上热情高呼：“兄弟中国人民的伟大领袖和阿尔巴尼亚人民最伟大的朋友毛泽东主席万岁！”工人林希在会上发言说，“中国的劳动人民像一个人一样团结在他们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的周围，必将冲破一切困难和障碍，永远向前迈进，进一步加强无产阶级专政，把兄弟的中华人民共和国的威信提得高上加高。”
    拉齐磷肥厂职工集会通过的一封致上海工人的信中说，“我们永远支持兄弟的中国革命工人的英勇斗争。你们的斗争和胜利也鼓舞着我们去夺取新的胜利。正在胜利开展着的中国无产阶级文化大革命对中国人民和全世界人民的未来都具有重大意义，因为人民中国今天是社会主义和世界革命的堡垒，是各国人民争取解放和革命的强大和忠实的保卫者。”“由我们两国的马克思列宁主义党和我们两国人民的敬爱领袖恩维尔·霍查和毛泽东同志锤炼起来的我们两国人民之间的友谊，是永恒的革命友谊，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共修正主义叛徒领导为首的现代修正主义和争取革命和社会主义胜利的斗争中，我们将同你们永远并肩前进。”
    吉诺卡斯特五金厂的职工在集会上宣读了上海工人革命群众组织致阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级的感谢信。工人曼加在集会上热情地说，毛泽东思想是伟大的中国人民在社会主义和共产主义胜利道路上的一盏光芒四射的明灯。毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展，使帝国主义者和修正主义者疯狂咆哮和坐卧不安，因为毛泽东思想和无产阶级文化大革命使他们的计划破了产，使他们失去了企图使中华人民共和国改变颜色的一切希望。
    库克斯炼铜厂的冶炼工人秦古在工厂举行的集会上发言，热烈祝贺上海工人革命造反总司令部和其他革命群众组织采取的革命措施。他表示在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义的斗争中，将永远同上海的革命者和全中国人民站在一条战线上。
