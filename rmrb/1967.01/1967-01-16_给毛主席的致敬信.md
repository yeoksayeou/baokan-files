Most, most respected great leader Chairman Mao:

We, the entire body of red rebels and revolutionary workers of Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, pay our highest proletarian cultural revolution salute to you, the reddest red sun in our hearts!

Today, at our Beijing First Machine Tool Factory's rally to "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production, and Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line," we report to you with hearts full of excitement: Under the correct guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, the revolutionary forces in our factory are becoming stronger and stronger, and the situation is getting better and better. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are becoming more and more isolated, and their reactionary faces have been exposed to more revolutionary masses. Currently, the proletarian cultural revolution in our factory, like the rest of the country, is surging forward with the force of a landslide and the power of thunder, breaking through all obstacles, and surging forward to a deeper and broader new stage!

"Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" is a major policy you have proposed and repeatedly emphasized. However, it is infuriating that a handful of power-holders within our factory who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are doing everything they can to sabotage this great policy. At first, they used "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" as a cover to suppress the revolution! When their tricks were exposed, they played new tricks, throwing down their tools and washing their hands of the matter. Even more vile, they used economic benefits and material incentives as bait, attempting to lead this serious political struggle down the path of economism, diverting the direction of the struggle, sabotaging production, and achieving their evil goal of sabotaging the proletarian cultural revolution in our factory.

Facing the conspiracy of the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, the resolute answer of all the revolutionary rebels in the First Machine Tool Factory is: Let them perish! "The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will?" We can hold up the sky if it falls! We can fill in the earth if it collapses! We are revolutionary rebels standing tall and firm! There has never been a savior; we must liberate ourselves!

We revolutionary rebels have the clearest minds and the sharpest eyes, and we are the ones who listen to the Party Central Committee and you the most!

"White terror" cannot intimidate us, and "sugar-coated bullets" cannot defeat us. Who wants their stinking money? We want socialism!

We deeply understand that if we do not overthrow the bourgeois reactionary line, if we do not uproot the roots of revisionism, if we do not carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, our factory will slide onto the capitalist road, our country will change color, we will be thrown back into the bitter sea, and the revolutionary people of the world will suffer!

"Looking up, I see the Big Dipper; day and night, I think of Mao Zedong." It is you who gave us the courage to fight during the white terror in our factory; it is you who, at every critical moment of the revolution, pointed out the direction for us to advance. Today, facing the desperate and vicious sabotage of production and the rampant promotion of economism by the bourgeois reactionary line, which is red-eyed and conducting a full-scale counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, we have no enemies but ourselves! Respected Chairman Mao, you support us, and we will make you proud! We will not rest until we smash the vicious counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

Our resolve is: to firmly implement the policy you have proposed, to grasp the revolution and promote production. We firmly guarantee: while actively participating in the cultural revolution, we will also steadfastly hold our positions in production and construction, adhere to the eight-hour workday, strive to complete and overfulfill production plans, and strive for high-quality products.

Our slogan is: to be both the vanguard of the revolution and the pioneer of production. We vow to be models of "Grasping Revolution, Promoting Production" and to achieve double victories in revolution and production in 1967!

Respected Chairman Mao, thousands of words cannot express our feelings today. We solemnly pledge to you: we will read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions for the rest of our lives. We will follow you through the storms of class struggle, forever loyal to the Party, the people, and you, old comrade!

Finally, we sincerely wish you, old comrade, eternal life! Eternal life!

### 给毛主席的致敬信

专栏：

    给毛主席的致敬信最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    我们北京第一机床厂全体红色造反者，全体革命职工，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，致以最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    今天，在我们北京第一机床厂举行“抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”的誓师大会上，我们以无限兴奋的心情向您汇报：在以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线的正确指引下，我厂革命力量越来越壮大，形势越来越好，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙，越来越孤立，他们的反动面目已被更多的革命群众所识破。目前，我厂的无产阶级文化大革命同全国一样，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，冲破重重阻力，汹涌澎湃地向着更深入，更广阔的新阶段发展！
    “抓革命，促生产”是您提出来，并且一再强调的重大方针，但是令人气愤的是，我厂一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，却千方百计破坏“抓革命，促生产”这一伟大方针。开始，他们假借“抓革命，促生产”为名，行“以生产压革命”之实，来破坏无产阶级文化大革命运动！当他们的鬼把戏被戳穿之后，他们又在玩弄新的花招，撂挑子，撒手不管。更加恶劣的是，他们以经济福利、物质刺激为诱饵，妄图把这场严肃的政治斗争引向经济主义的邪路上去，转移斗争的大方向，破坏生产，以达到破坏我厂无产阶级文化大革命运动的罪恶目的。
    面对资产阶级反动路线新反扑的阴谋，我们第一机床厂全体革命造反者的坚决回答是：叫它们完蛋！“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”天塌下来我们能顶住！地陷下去我们能填平！我们是顶天立地的革命造反者！从来就没有什么救世主，全靠我们自己解放自己！
    我们革命造反者，心最明，眼最亮，是最听党中央和您的话的！
    “白色恐怖”吓不倒我们，“糖衣炮弹”也打不倒我们。谁稀罕他们这几个臭钱，我们要的是社会主义！
    我们深深懂得，不批倒资产阶级反动路线，不挖掉修正主义的老根，不把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，我们的工厂就会滑到资本主义的道路上去，我们的国家就会改变颜色，我们就会被重新打入苦海，世界革命人民就要遭殃！
    “抬头望见北斗星，日夜想念毛泽东。”是您，在我厂白色恐怖时给我们斗争的勇气；是您，每当革命发展的关键时刻，给我们指明前进的方向。今天，面临彻底完蛋的资产阶级反动路线输红了眼，大肆破坏生产，大搞经济主义，猖狂地向以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线进行全面反扑了。有敌无我，有我无敌！敬爱的毛主席，您给我们撑腰，我们给您争气！不打垮资产阶级反动路线的猖狂反扑，我们死不瞑目。
    我们的决心是：坚决贯彻执行您提出来的方针，狠抓革命，大促生产。我们坚决保证：一面积极参加文化大革命，一面坚守生产建设岗位，坚持八小时工作制，努力完成和超额完成生产计划，并力争产品的高质量。
    我们的口号是：既做革命的尖兵，也做生产的闯将。誓做“抓革命，促生产”的模范！誓夺一九六七年的革命、生产双胜利！
    敬爱的毛主席，千言万语也难以表达我们今天的心情。我们庄严地向您宣誓：一定要一辈子读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，一辈子跟着您在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进，做一个永远忠于党、忠于人民、忠于您老人家的红色造反者！
    最后，衷心地祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                北京第一机床厂“抓革命，促生产，
                彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”誓师大会
                                      一九六七年一月十二日
