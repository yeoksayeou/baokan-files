The Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters' Revolutionary Rebels' Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao
New China News Agency, Taiyuan, January 25th – The Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters' Revolutionary Rebels' Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao, in full, reads as follows:

Most, most, most, most respected leader Chairman Mao:

We, the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters' revolutionary rebels, pay our highest proletarian cultural revolution combat salute to you – the reddest red sun in our hearts!

When we heard the Central People's Radio broadcast our headquarters' first notice and saw the People's Daily editorial "The Great Victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanxi Province," our hearts were filled with immense excitement. This is your greatest concern, greatest encouragement, greatest support, and greatest spur for us. It is under your great guidance that we, the Shanxi revolutionary rebels, have seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Shanxi Provincial Committee who formed a counter-revolutionary revisionist clique! Even if we shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" a thousand times, ten thousand times, it is not enough to express our boundless love for you; even if we sing "The East Is Red" a thousand times, ten thousand times, it is not enough to express our resolve to follow you in making revolution forever.

The handful of capitalist-roaders in the Shanxi Provincial Committee, who formed a counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, following the orders of their black commander, have long been working to restore capitalism in China, turning Shanxi into an "independent kingdom" where no one can penetrate. They have suppressed and persecuted revolutionary cadres and masses, ruthlessly implementing bourgeois dictatorship. In this proletarian cultural revolution, they have followed their black commander even more fiercely, stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing mass movements, encircling revolutionary rebels. Recently, they have thrown out the rotten weapon of economism, opposing your directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," attempting to sabotage the socialist economy, sabotage proletarian dictatorship, and sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution.

"Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves."

Under your brilliant guidance and personally initiated and led great proletarian cultural revolution, the Shanxi revolutionary rebels have carried out great unity, united with the broad revolutionary masses, and given them a resounding blow, smashing their counter-revolutionary encirclement, defeating their economism corruption, resolutely implementing your revolutionary line, resolutely carrying out your directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," repelling their counterattacks, and achieving a new revolutionary great situation.

We, the revolutionary rebels among workers, peasants, students, and cadres, have raised your banner high, closely united with the revolutionary rebels among the leading cadres, under the full support of the Shanxi Military Region, seized their power, overthrew their regime, and established the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters.

Recalling when this sapling just sprouted, evil winds and rainstorms came one after another, the black hands of the class enemy reached out to this budding sapling...

The class enemy is extremely afraid of us revolutionary rebels uniting closely with revolutionary leading cadres, so they try to blur the line between revolution and counter-revolution among the leading cadres, attacking us as being controlled by opportunism and a "black organization."

The class enemy is extremely afraid of us revolutionary rebels uniting closely with the People's Liberation Army, so they bring out the "non-intervention" in local cultural revolutions, attacking us as tools of "factionalism" and "counter-revolutionary" restoration.

But we firmly believe that revolutionary leading cadres fighting together with us completely accords with your teachings to them: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution better."

We firmly believe that the People's Liberation Army standing on our side of the revolutionary rebels completely accords with your teachings to them: "Stand firmly with the Chinese people, wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people, this is the sole purpose of this army."

After studying your instructions, our hearts are redder, our eyes are brighter, and we are more determined in our belief: our actions completely accord with your thoughts. We will definitely raise high the banner of unity, raise high the banner of seizing power, bravely face the storm of struggle. Your shining treasure book tells us: the future belongs to us!

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, it is you who have guided us to clear away the fog, see the direction, and stand firmly. Every time we think of all this, how can we not shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" again and again? How can we not sing "The East Is Red" time and time again!

We deeply understand that the cultural revolution initiated and led by you is an unprecedented great revolutionary struggle in human history. We are doing what no one has done before. The enemies we face are not just this handful of scoundrels in Shanxi Province, but the entire old world. We have an unshakable belief: with you leading the way, we proletarian revolutionary rebels can sweep away all the filth and vermin, and with our iron fists, create a red, red communist new Shanxi! New China! New world!

Finally, we, the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters' revolutionary rebels, most sincerely wish you, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!! Eternal life!!!

    山西革命造反总指挥部全体革命造反派
　　给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社太原二十五日电　山西革命造反总指挥部全体革命造反派给毛主席的致敬电，全文如下：最最最最敬爱的领袖毛主席：
    我们山西革命造反总指挥部全体革命造反派，向您——我们心中最红最红的红太阳致以最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼！
      当我们听到中央人民广播电台广播我们总指挥部的第一号通告和看到人民日报社论《山西省无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利》的时候，我们的心情万分激动，这是您对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的支持，最大的鞭策。是在您老人家的伟大思想指引下，我们山西革命造反派，从山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派组成的反革命修正主义集团手中把大权夺过来了！我们纵然高呼
  一千遍一万遍“毛主席万岁”，也呼不尽我们对您无限热爱的心情；我们纵然高唱一千遍一万遍《东方红》，也唱不完我们永远跟着您闹革命的决心。
      山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派组成的反革命修正主义集团，秉承他们黑司令的意旨，为在中国复辟资本主义，长期以来，把山西搞成一个针插不进、水泼不进的“独立王国”。他们打击、迫害革命干部、革命群众，残酷地实行资产阶级专政。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，他们紧跟他们的黑司令，更加变本加厉，顽固坚持执行资产阶级反动路线，镇压群众运动，围剿革命造反派，最近，又抛出经济主义这个破烂武器，对抗您老人家提出的
  “抓革命，促生产”的方针，企图破坏社会主义经济，破坏无产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
      “独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”
      在您老人家光辉思想指引下，在您老人家亲自发动和领导的这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，山西省革命造反派，实行了大联合，团结广大革命群众，给他们迎头痛击，粉碎了他们的反革命围剿，击败了他们经济主义的腐蚀，坚决执行您的革命路线，坚决贯彻您的“抓革命，促生产”的英明指示，打退了他们的反扑，出现了新的革命大好形势。
      我们工人、农民、学生、干部的革命造反派高举起您的旗帜，和领导干部中的革命造反派紧紧地结合在一起，在山西军区的全力支持下，夺了他们的权，专了他们的政，成立了山西革命造反总指挥部。
      回忆回忆这个幼苗刚出土的时候，阴风恶雨阵阵袭来，阶级敌人的黑手伸向了这株初萌的幼苗……。
      阶级敌人极端害怕我们革命造反派和革命的领导干部紧紧地结合在一起，就极力混淆领导干部中革命和反革命的界限，攻击我们是被机会主义控制的“黑组织”。
      阶级敌人极端害怕我们革命造反派和人民解放军紧紧地结合在
  一起，就拿出什么“不介入”地方文化大革命的法宝，攻击我们成了“宗派主义”斗争和“反革命”复辟的工具。
    但是我们坚信，革命的领导干部和我们共同战斗完全符合您对他们的教导：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
      我们坚信，人民解放军站在我们革命造反派一边也完全符合您对他们的教导：“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”
      当我们学习了您的指示之后，心更红了，眼更亮了，我们更加坚定了我们的信念：我们的行动是完全符合您的思想的，我们一定高举起联合的大旗，高举起夺权的大旗，勇敢地迎接斗争的暴风雨，您那金光闪闪的宝书告诉我们：未来是属于我们的！
      毛主席呀，毛主席，是您老人家引导我们拨开了迷雾，看准了方向，站稳了脚跟。每当想起了这一切，叫我们怎么能不一次再一次地高呼“毛主席万岁！”怎么能不一遍又一遍地高唱《东方红》！
    我们深深地懂得，您老人家发动和领导的这场文化大革命是人类历史上空前伟大的革命斗争，我们正做着前人从未做过的事业，我们面对着的敌人不仅是山西省这一小撮坏蛋，而是整个的旧世界，我们有着不可动摇的信念：有您老人家在前面引路，我们无产阶级革命造反派就能荡涤一切污泥浊水，扫尽一切害人虫！用我们的铁拳，打出一个红彤彤的共产主义的新山西！新中国！新世界！
    最后，我们山西革命造反总指挥部的全体革命造反派最最衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！万寿无疆！！！
                  山西革命造反总指挥部全体革命造反派
                                 一九六七年一月二十五日
