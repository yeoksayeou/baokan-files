The revolutionary rebels and all revolutionary workers of the Beijing Synthetic Fiber Experimental Factory warmly welcomed the most intimate comrades-in-arms from the frontline of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, Comrade Hysni Kapo, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, Comrade Behar Shytra, member of the Central Committee, and Ambassador of Albania to China, Comrade Vasili Natanaeli, who came to visit the factory. The Albanian comrades were accompanied by Comrade Chen Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council. Upon their arrival at the factory, the revolutionary rebels and workers of the entire factory, holding red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gathered at the factory gate, beating drums and gongs, enthusiastically shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples and parties of China and Albania!"

Comrade Kapo gave an impassioned speech amidst enthusiastic applause. He enthusiastically praised Mao Zedong Thought, pointing out that the revolutionary people of the whole world support Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the entire world.

Comrade Kapo highly praised the revolutionary rebels of the Beijing Synthetic Fiber Experimental Factory, who, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have been engaged in a tenacious struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the factory and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, seizing back the power of the factory. He firmly believed that under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will surely achieve thorough victory.

Comrade Kapo strongly denounced the Soviet revisionist leadership for betraying Marxism-Leninism and restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union.

Comrade Chen Yi also spoke. He thanked Comrade Kapo for his correct evaluation of Mao Zedong Thought and his resolute support for the Chinese working class, which is unyieldingly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "Although countries may be big or small, the Albanian people are a great people, the Party of Labor of Albania is a great party, and Comrade Enver Hoxha is a great leader." Comrade Chen Yi said: "We firmly believe that the great Chinese people and the great Albanian people, along with all revolutionary peoples and oppressed peoples of the world, under the leadership of the great leaders Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha, will march forward shoulder to shoulder and victory will surely be ours."

Revolutionary rebel representative Jiang Weidong introduced the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in this factory to the Albanian comrades.

The revolutionary rebels presented their most cherished book, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," Mao badges, and armbands of revolutionary rebels and red rebels to the Albanian comrades. Comrade Kapo presented Albanian commemorative badges to the representatives of the revolutionary rebels. Comrade Kapo and the representatives of the revolutionary rebels embraced each other warmly, and the entire venue resounded with enthusiastic cheers. The hearts of the peoples of China and Albania are united like an iron wall.

When Comrade Kapo and Comrade Shytra finished their visit and left the factory, the revolutionary rebel workers reluctantly shook hands and embraced the Albanian comrades, shouting: "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Comrade Kapo shouted in Chinese: "Long live Chairman Mao!" This demonstrated the resolve of the peoples and parties of China and Albania to stand together, fight together, and win together forever.
