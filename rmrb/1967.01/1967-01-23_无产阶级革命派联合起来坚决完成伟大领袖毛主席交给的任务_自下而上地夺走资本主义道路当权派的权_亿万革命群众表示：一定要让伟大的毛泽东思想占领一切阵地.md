The proletarian revolutionary faction must unite to resolutely complete the task given by the great leader Chairman Mao. From the bottom up, we must seize the power from the capitalistic road faction in power. The millions of revolutionary masses declare: We must definitely let the great thought of Mao Zedong occupy all positions.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 22nd, the editorial "The Proletarian Revolutionary Faction Unite, Seize the Power from the Capitalistic Road Faction in Power!" in the People's Daily has sounded the charge for the proletarian revolutionary faction to unite and launch a nationwide struggle to seize power from those who are taking the capitalistic road. The proletarian revolutionary factions in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Wuhan, and other places have enthusiastically expressed that they will immediately take action, unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a nationwide struggle to seize power, and take back all the powers—party power, political power, economic power, etc.—from those who are taking the capitalistic road. They will let the great thought of Mao Zedong occupy all positions, establish a brand-new proletarian order, and complete the great historical mission given by the great leader Chairman Mao to the proletarian revolutionary factions across the country.

Currently, revolutionary rebels from all walks of life in the capital are closely uniting, forming a surging tide, and fiercely attacking the party members who are taking the capitalistic road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They are seizing back the party power, political power, and economic power that have been monopolized by them. A great battle scene and a thriving spectacle are unfolding before people. Revolutionary rebel workers from the Capital Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters said, "This editorial speaks our hearts. We must unite and seize the power from the capitalistic road faction in power. This is the right of the broad revolutionary masses and the right given by Chairman Mao. After seizing the power, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings to better serve the people, be the people's ox, and accelerate the socialist revolution and socialist construction." The responsible person from the Capital Workers' Red Rebel Liaison Station said, "The editorial in the People's Daily greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary rebels and greatly dampens the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. It tolls the death knell for the complete collapse of the bourgeois reactionary line. We must unite with all revolutionary rebels, unite, seize power for the party, seize power for the proletariat, and seize power for communism. Let the great thought of Mao Zedong occupy all positions."

The revolutionary rebels in the financial and commercial system, who were the first to achieve unity among the revolutionary rebels nationwide, said in a discussion, "Our current primary task is to unite all revolutionary factions in the financial and commercial system to seize power, to seize it completely and thoroughly, and take back all powers. We must firmly grasp the fate of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the fate of the socialist economy. We must control the trade sector, the financial sector, and the banking sector, and thoroughly smash all forms of counter-revolutionary revisionist economicism."

Revolutionary workers and cadres in the capital's publishing system excitedly said, "The revolutionary rebels in the capital's publishing system have achieved unity and taken back the power to publish Chairman Mao's works and all other powers from those who are taking the capitalistic road and stubbornly pushing the bourgeois reactionary line. We must print, reprint, and quickly print Chairman Mao's works, so that more revolutionary people at home and abroad can obtain Chairman Mao's precious books, and let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shine all over the world." The broad Red Guards and revolutionary students in the capital resolutely declared that they would unite with revolutionary workers, revolutionary peasants, and revolutionary cadres to seize the power from the capitalistic road faction in power. The warriors of the Red Flag Combat Team of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics said: "The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. With power, we have everything. Since the start of our revolution, what we have been thinking about, saying, and doing is seizing power. We will seize power for the proletariat and for communism, and let the great thought of Mao Zedong occupy all positions." Some warriors of the East Is Red Combat Team of the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards of Hongqi Commune excitedly said: "We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, unite with all revolutionary rebels, and seize back the power from that small group of people who are taking the capitalistic road and insist on executing the bourgeois reactionary line."

The broad revolutionary rebels and masses in Shanghai, who are launching a comprehensive offensive against those who are taking the capitalistic road, expressed with revolutionary enthusiasm: "Under the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanghai will definitely unite and unite, with the revolutionary spirit of 'seizing the day,' break through all difficulties and obstacles, and take back all the powers—party, political, economic, etc.—from those who are taking the capitalistic road! The revolutionary rebels of the No. 17 Cotton Mill and Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory recalled the struggle before and after seizing power in the factory and said: "The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. With power, we have everything. Today, we revolutionary rebels have seized the power, and this power is seized and will not be given up again! The revolutionary rebel workers of Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory also deeply felt: Those who have been seized of power, a small group of party members who are taking the capitalistic road and stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, will not willingly retire from the historical stage. They will struggle desperately and more fiercely oppose the proletarian revolutionary factions. The way to deal with these people is to firmly implement the dictatorship of the proletariat on them." The revolutionary rebels and masses of Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily warmly welcomed the publication of the editorial in the People's Daily. They deeply felt from their personal struggle practice that the essence of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is the struggle of the proletariat to seize power from the bourgeoisie. Without seizing power, the revolutionary factions cannot rise up, and the victories already achieved in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat may be lost. Only by thoroughly defeating the counter-revolutionary revisionists and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and letting Mao Zedong Thought firmly occupy all positions.

The warriors of the "Revolution First, Production Second" Joint Command Headquarters in Shanghai resolutely declared that the seizure of power by the revolutionary rebels must be thorough, and all powers must be seized, firmly grasping the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the fate of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and the fate of the socialist economy in their own hands.

The revolutionary rebels in Tianjin, who are engaged in the struggle to seize power, resolutely declared that they must achieve the unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions and seize the power from those who are taking the capitalistic road. The Tianjin Flour Mill, which is composed of more than thirty revolutionary rebel organizations, seized the power from the capitalistic road faction in the factory on the day the editorial in the People's Daily was published. The factory immediately celebrated its rebirth with drums and gongs. The revolutionary rebels who had gone through hard struggles excitedly said today, "No matter who it is, as long as they deviate from Mao Zedong Thought and take the capitalistic road, we will definitely seize their power. On this issue, we will not be gentle and yielding." Some cadres from the revolutionary rebel faction of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party said, "All leadership in Tianjin must truly be in the hands of the revolutionary rebels. We must firmly unite with the workers and peasants and, in the great revolutionary storm, form a great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, seize the leadership from the hands of a small group of party members who are taking the capitalistic road and stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and establish a truly high-held revolutionary command headquarters of Mao Zedong Thought in Tianjin."

The revolutionary rebels in Shenyang excitedly said, "The unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions and the seizure of power from the capitalistic road faction in power is the great call of our wise and great commander Chairman Mao. We support it a thousand times and agree with it a thousand times! We must unite under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seize all powers from those who are taking the capitalistic road, and this is our duty as proletarian revolutionary factions." The revolutionary rebels of Shenyang Rolling Mill said, "Chairman Mao understands our revolutionary rebels the best. He proposed that we proletarian revolutionary factions unite and seize the power from the capitalistic road faction in power, which is very important and great. We proletarian revolutionary factions are loyal to the party, to Chairman Mao, and to the proletarian revolutionary cause. To ensure that our country will never change color, we are fearless of heaven and earth. We will resolutely execute Chairman Mao's orders, unite, and seize power! If the enemy does not surrender, we will definitely annihilate it!" To seize power, the five revolutionary rebel organizations in this factory have united and established a joint action command headquarters. The revolutionary warriors of the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards of Shenyang Hard-Bone Rebel Headquarters said, "The editorial in the People's Daily has pointed out the direction of our struggle. Now, the class enemies are colluding with the ghosts and snakes in society to form a counter-revolutionary unity. We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call, unite, and launch a counterattack, joining the struggle to seize power."

The broad revolutionary workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres in Guangzhou have taken decisive action and launched a great struggle to seize power from a small group of party members who are taking the capitalistic road. The revolutionary rebels of the "Red Flag Workers' Red Guards Guangzhou Headquarters" excitedly said, "Only the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions can seize the power from the capitalistic road faction in power. After seizing power, we can firmly grasp the power and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end." The revolutionary rebel Red Guards organization of Zhongshan Medical College and the revolutionary rebel organization of peasants in Guangzhou, the Mao Zedong Thought Red Farmers Friend Guangzhou Suburban Stone Well Area Headquarters, both published articles, expressing their resolute implementation of the great unity of revolutionary rebels and organizing a vast army of cultural revolution to seize the power from the capitalistic road faction in power.

The revolutionary rebels on various fronts in Xi'an enthusiastically welcomed the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions and the seizure of power from the capitalistic road faction in power, saying it is excellent! They praised it as an extremely great innovation in the international communist movement and a new leap in China's Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The First Automobile Parts Manufacturing Factory in Shaanxi Province was previously monopolized by party members who are taking the capitalistic road. Despite having excellent modern equipment, they refused to accept the national automobile parts manufacturing tasks and insisted on turning a manufacturing factory into an automobile repair factory. In June last year, a few revolutionary workers posted a big-character poster titled "Where is the Automobile Parts Manufacturing Factory Going?" exposing the crimes of the capitalistic road faction in power within the factory and were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." Later, the revolutionary workers organized and partially seized power, striking the arrogance of the capitalistic road faction in power within the factory, but they had not completely collapsed. Until the end of last year, the capitalistic road faction in power in this factory, in collusion with the capitalistic road faction in power in the Shaanxi Provincial Transportation Department, refused to accept the national automobile parts manufacturing plan and only accepted 47% of the production plan. Recently, the revolutionary rebel workers were indignant, rose up together, and seized all the political, economic, and cultural powers of the factory, accepting automobile parts manufacturing tasks that exceeded the national plan. The revolutionary rebel workers of this factory said, "Only by thoroughly seizing power from the bottom up can we thoroughly smash a small group of party members who are taking the capitalistic road, ensure the dictatorship of the proletariat, ensure that our enterprises advance along the socialist path, and ensure that the socialist mountains will never change color."

The revolutionary rebel warriors on various fronts in Chengdu have, in recent days, taken Shanghai's revolutionary rebels as an example, resolutely counterattacked the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and launched a struggle to seize power from a small group of party members who are taking the capitalistic road. Today, after hearing the editorial in the People's Daily on the 22nd, they unanimously cheered that this is support and encouragement for the revolutionary rebels. The comrades from the Chengdu Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps, Chengdu Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Revolutionary Rebel Corps, and the revolutionary rebels of the financial and commercial system in Chengdu, as well as the revolutionary rebel students and teachers and the Little Red Guards in Chengdu, all expressed that we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The enemy will not disappear by itself." We must definitely implement the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to seize power of the proletariat, and resolutely seize all powers from the hands of a small group of party members who are taking the capitalistic road and stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. The revolutionary rebel workers of the First Automobile Repair Factory in Chengdu felt from their personal experience: The various powers held by the representatives of the bourgeoisie must be seized. In early January, the capitalistic road faction in power in this factory used various means to sabotage production and suppress the revolution, and from the 1st to the 11th, the entire factory only repaired four vehicles. The broad revolutionary workers saw through the plot of the faction in power and decided to seize the power from the hands of the faction in power. They organized an takeover group and completely took over all powers in the factory. During this period, the revolutionary rebel workers and the faction in power had a face-to-face struggle, while also doing a good job in production. From the 12th to the 21st, in just ten days, they repaired twenty-six vehicles, creating a new record since the factory was established. The revolutionary rebels of Guixi Commune said: "Some people say that we poor and lower-middle peasants lack culture and have no leadership experience, and even if we seize power, we still won't be able to do it. This is completely a lie. We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We not only can completely seize the power but also, in this great struggle of destruction and construction, we will break the private ownership concepts and habits left over from thousands of years, making the countryside present a new situation."

The revolutionary rebel workers, students, and cadres in Wuhan, who are engaged in the struggle to seize power from a small group of party members who are taking the capitalistic road, enthusiastically cheered after hearing the editorial in the People's Daily, saying that the publication of this editorial speaks the hearts of the revolutionary rebel workers. Recently, the proletarian revolutionary rebels who seized power from the capitalistic road faction in power in the Wuhan Light Industry Mold Factory said, "We have seized the power from the hands of the bourgeois agents. This is the result of the great unity of the revolutionary rebels, a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great leader Chairman Mao has supported us revolutionary rebels. We have the spirit and ability to run the factory as a great school of Mao Zedong Thought."

　　无产阶级革命派联合起来坚决完成伟大领袖毛主席交给的任务
　　自下而上地夺走资本主义道路当权派的权
　　亿万革命群众表示：一定要让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地
    据新华社二十二日讯　《人民日报》社论《无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权！》吹响了无产阶级革命派实行大联合，在全国范围内向走资本主义道路的当权派展开群众性的全面夺权斗争的冲锋号。北京、上海、天津、沈阳、广州、西安、成都、武汉等地的无产阶级革命派热烈表示：要立即行动起来，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下实现大联合，展开全国全面的夺权斗争，把党权、政权、财权等各种大权从走资本主义道路当权派的手里统统夺回来，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，建立崭新的无产阶级新秩序，完成伟大领袖毛主席交给全国无产阶级革命派的伟大历史使命。
    目前，首都各界革命造反派正在紧密联合起来，汇成一支汹涌澎湃的洪流，猛烈地冲击党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，夺回被他们把持的党权、政权、财权。一个大决战的场面，一番蓬蓬勃勃的景象，正展现在人们的面前。首都职工革命造反总部的革命造反派工人说，这篇社论说出了我们的心里话，我们就是要搞大联合，要夺走资本主义道路当权派的权。这是广大革命群众的权利，是毛主席给的权利。我们夺了权，一定要按照毛主席的教导，更好地为人民服务，当人民群众的牛，加速社会主义革命和社会主义建设。首都职工红色造反总联络站的负责人说：《人民日报》的社论，大长了我们革命造反派的志气，大灭了资产阶级老爷们的威风，它敲响了资产阶级反动路线全线崩溃、彻底垮台的丧钟。我们要和一切革命造反派联合起来，团结起来，为党夺权，为无产阶级夺权，为共产主义夺权，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。全国各系统中第一个实现革命造反派大联合的财贸系统革命造反者在座谈中说，我们当前的首要任务就是要联合财贸系统一切革命派，进行夺权，就是要全面地夺，彻底地夺，把一切权力统统夺过来，紧紧掌握住无产阶级文化大革命的命运，掌握住社会主义经济的命运，把住贸易口，把住财政口，把住银行口，彻底摧毁形形色色反革命修正主义的经济主义。首都出版系统革命造反派的革命工人和革命干部兴奋地说，我们首都出版系统的革命造反派实行大联合，已经把出版毛主席著作的权力和其他一切权力，从那些走资本主义道路当权派和顽固推行资产阶级反动路线的人的手里夺了回来。我们一定要大印、多印、快印毛主席著作，让国内、国外更多的革命人民能得到毛主席的宝书，让毛泽东思想的光辉普照全球。首都广大红卫兵战士和革命师生坚决表示要和革命工人，革命农民，革命干部联合起来，大夺走资本主义道路当权派的权。北京航空学院红旗战斗队的战士们说：革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了权，就有了一切。自干革命之日起，我们想的，说的，干的，就是夺权。我们要为无产阶级、为共产主义夺权，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。红星公社毛泽东思想红卫兵东方红战斗团的一些战士兴奋地说：我们一定响应毛主席的伟大号召，同一切革命造反派联合起来，从那一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的人手中夺回印把子。
    正在向走资本主义道路当权派全面展开总进攻的上海广大革命造反派和革命群众，满怀着革命豪情表示：在我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召下，上海的无产阶级革命派一定联合起来，团结起来，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，冲破任何艰难险阻，从走资本主义道路当权派的手里把党、政、财等各种大权统统夺回来！国棉十七厂和上海玻璃机械厂的革命造反者们，回顾厂里夺权前后的斗争情形时说：革命的根本问题就是政权问题，有了权，就有了一切。今天我们革命造反派已经夺过了印把子，这个印把子就夺定了，再也不放下来了！上海玻璃机械厂的革命造反派工人还深深地体会到：被夺了权的一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，并不会甘心退出历史舞台，他们总要拚命挣扎，更疯狂地反对无产阶级革命派。对付这些家伙的办法，只有对他们坚决实行无产阶级专政。《文汇报》《解放日报》的革命造反派和革命群众，热烈欢呼《人民日报》社论的发表。他们从亲身斗争的实践中深刻体会到，无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实质就是无产阶级向资产阶级夺权。不夺权，革命派就不能翻身，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得的胜利就可能丧失。只有把那些反革命修正主义分子和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子打倒在地上，再踏上一只脚，叫他们永世不得翻身，实行无产阶级专政，让毛泽东思想牢牢占领住一切阵地。上海“抓革命，促生产火线联合指挥部”的战士们坚决表示，革命造反派夺权一定要夺得彻底，要把一切大权统统夺过来，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里。
    正在进行夺权斗争的天津市的革命造反派坚决表示，一定要实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，把印把子从那些走资本主义道路当权派的手中夺过来。天津麻纺厂三十多个革命造反组织联合组成的无产阶级革命造反大队，在《人民日报》社论发表的当天，夺了厂里走资本主义道路当权派的权，全厂顿时锣鼓喧天，欢庆工厂的新生。经过了艰苦斗争的革命造反者们今天激动地说，不管是谁，只要离开毛泽东思想，走资本主义道路，他的权我们就非夺不可，在这个问题上决不能温良恭俭让。中共天津市委机关革命造反派的一些干部说，天津市的一切领导权必须真正掌握在革命造反派手里。我们要坚决同工农群众相结合，在革命的大风浪里，形成无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，把领导权从一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手里夺过来，在天津市建立一个真正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的革命司令部。
    沈阳革命造反者激动地说，无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，这是我们英明伟大的统帅毛主席的伟大号召，我们一万个拥护，一万个赞成！我们要在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下联合起来，把一切大权从走资本主义道路的当权派手里统统夺过来，这是我们无产阶级革命派的天职。沈阳轧钢厂的革命造反派说，毛主席最了解我们革命造反派的心，他提出来要我们无产阶级革命派联合起来，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，这太重要了，太好了。我们无产阶级革命派，对党、对毛主席、对无产阶级革命事业赤胆忠心，为了使我们的国家永不变色，我们天不怕，地不怕，我们坚决执行毛主席的命令，联合起来，夺权！敌人不投降，就坚决叫它灭亡！为了夺权，这个厂的五个革命造反组织已经联合起来，成立了联合行动指挥部。毛泽东思想红卫兵沈阳硬骨头造反总团的革命战士们说，《人民日报》的这篇社论给我们革命造反派指明了斗争方向。现在，阶级敌人正在和社会上的牛鬼蛇神勾结一起，搞反革命的联合，我们必须响应毛主席的伟大号召，联合起来给予回击，投入到夺权斗争中去。
    广州市广大革命工人、革命农民、革命知识分子和革命干部已经坚决行动起来，向一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派展开了夺权的伟大斗争。广州工人革命造反派组织“红旗工人赤卫队广州总部”的革命造反者们兴奋地说，只有无产阶级革命派大联合，才能夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，夺权之后才能牢牢地掌握住印把子，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。中山医学院革命造反派红卫兵组织和广州市农民革命造反派组织毛泽东思想红农友广州市郊区石井地区总部都发表文章，表示坚决实行革命造反派大联合，组织起一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，大夺走资本主义道路当权派的权。
    西安各条战线的革命造反派热烈欢呼无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权好得很！他们称赞这是国际共产主义运动中的极其伟大的创举，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的一个新的飞跃。陕西省西安第一汽车配件制造厂过去被党内走资本主义道路的当权派所把持，尽管有很好的现代化设备，他们却拒不接受国家的汽车配件制造任务，强行要把一个制造工厂改成汽车修配厂。去年六月份，几位革命工人贴出了“汽车配件制造厂往何处去？”的大字报，揭发厂内走资本主义道路的当权派的罪行，被打成了“反革命分子”。后来革命工人们组织起来，进行了部分夺权，打击了厂内走资本主义道路当权派的威风，但当时他们还没有彻底垮台。直至去年年底，这个厂里走资本主义道路的当权派，还与陕西省交通厅的走资本主义道路的当权派狼狈为奸，拒接国家汽车配件制造计划，只接受生产计划的百分之四十七。最近，革命造反派工人怒不可遏，共同奋起，把工厂的政治、经济、文化大权统统夺了过来，接受的汽车配件制造任务超过了国家计划。这个工厂的革命造反派工人们说，只有全面地夺权，彻底地夺权，自下而上地夺权，才能彻底打垮一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，保证无产阶级专政，保证我们的企业沿着社会主义方向前进，保证社会主义江山永不变色。
    成都市各条战线的革命造反派战士，连日来以上海的革命造反派为榜样，坚决反击资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了夺权斗争。今天他们听到《人民日报》二十二日的社论后，同声欢呼这是对革命造反派的支持和鼓舞。成都工人革命造反兵团、成都贫下中农革命造反兵团和成都市财贸系统革命造反派的同志们，以及成都的革命造反派师生和红卫兵小将们都表示，我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导：“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，一定要实行无产阶级革命派大联合，发扬无产阶级敢于斗争、敢于夺权的革命造反精神，坚决地把一切权力从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手里夺过来。成都第一汽车修理厂革命造反派职工们，从自己的切身经历中体会到：资产阶级代表人物把持的各种权力，非夺不可。一月上旬，这个厂走资本主义道路的当权派采取了种种手段破坏生产，打击革命，一日至十一日全厂只大修了四辆车。广大革命职工识破了当权派的阴谋，决心把印把子从当权派手里夺过来。他们组织了接管小组，全部接管了厂里的一切权力。在这段时间里，革命造反派职工和当权派进行了面对面的斗争，同时搞好了生产。从十二日到二十一日的十天中，就大修了二十六部汽车，创造了建厂以来的最高纪录。桂溪公社的革命造反派说：有人说我们贫下中农缺文化，又没有领导经验，夺了权还是没办法。这完全是一派谰言。我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们不但完全能够把权夺过来，而且在这场大破大立的阶级斗争中，还要破除几千年留下的私有观念、习惯势力，使农村出现一个崭新的局面。
    正在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派实行全面夺权斗争的武汉市革命造反派工人、学生、机关干部，听到《人民日报》的社论后，热烈欢呼说，这篇社论的发表，说出了革命造反派工人的心里话。最近从党内走资本主义道路当权派手中夺了权的武汉轻工模具厂的无产阶级革命造反派说，我们从资产阶级代理人手中把权夺了过来，这是革命造反派实行大联合的结果，是毛泽东思想的新胜利，是最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席给我们革命造反派撑了腰。我们有志气有能力把工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
