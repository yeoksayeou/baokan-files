On January 9, the People's Daily published a highly important document on its front page. This is the "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production, Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line—An Open Letter to the People of Shanghai" issued by the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and ten other units, along with an editorial note. This is a great joyous event, a great joy for the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and all revolutionary students. It is a great joy for all revolutionary rebels. The "Open Letter to the People of Shanghai" is a thoroughly revolutionary document. As the editorial note of the People's Daily points out: "This document hoists the great red flag of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, sounding the bugle for a continued fierce counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line. This document firmly responds to Chairman Mao's great call to 'seize the revolution, promote production,' and raises the key issues in the current proletarian cultural revolution. This is not just a problem for Shanghai, but a nationwide issue."

"The enemy will not perish of itself." "In human history, all reactionary forces on the verge of extinction always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces." As the torrents of the proletarian cultural revolution are about to surge from schools and cultural units into factories and rural areas, as the People's Daily and Red Flag editorial on New Year's Day issued the great call for "full-scale class struggle nationwide," and as the main force of the cultural revolution—millions of workers and peasants—are massively joining the proletarian cultural revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line are in a state of panic, terrified to death. They sense that their end is near and are doing everything they can to sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. They deliberately set production against revolution, first using "focus on production" as an excuse to suppress the revolution and oppose seizing the revolution; then they appear in an "ultra-left" guise, using the banner of "seizing the revolution" to incite workers deceived by them to leave their production posts to "make revolution," even organizing "strikes" and "work stoppages." Both of these tactics are using the red flag to oppose the red flag, openly defying Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions on "seizing the revolution, promoting production." Their goal is to incite the masses to fight each other, create large-scale production accidents, divert attention, sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution, and protect themselves.

"Seize the revolution, promote production" is a crucial policy personally proposed by Chairman Mao. All revolutionary comrades, Red Guards, and workers enthusiastically propagate and resolutely carry out this highest directive. At present, we must thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line—using the banner of "seizing the revolution" to sabotage production and the cultural revolution.

All Red Guards and community members of the Beijing Normal University Jian Gangshan Commune will resolutely unite with the broad masses of revolutionary workers to implement Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution, promoting production," to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and to push the proletarian cultural revolution to a new high tide!

    这是一个彻底革命的文件
    北京师范大学井冈山公社
    一月九日，《人民日报》在头版发表了一个极其重要的文件，这就是上海工人革命造反总司令部等十一个单位的《抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑——告上海全市人民书》，并加了编者按。这是一件大喜事，是我们广大工农兵、红卫兵战士和一切革命师生的大喜事，是一切革命造反派的大喜事。《告上海全市人民书》是一个彻底革命的文件。正如《人民日报》编者按所指出的：“这个文件高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，吹响了继续向资产阶级反动路线猛烈反击的号角。这个文件坚决响应毛主席的‘抓革命，促生产’的伟大号召，提出了当前无产阶级文化大革命中的关键问题。这不仅是上海市的问题，而且是全国性的问题。”
      “敌人是不会自行消灭的。”“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的。”当着无产阶级文化大革命的洪流即将从学校、文教单位涌向工厂、农村，当着《人民日报》《红旗》元旦社论发出了“全国全面展开阶级斗争”的伟大号召，亿万文化大革命的主力军——工农群众大规模地投入无产阶级文化大革命的时候，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，恐慌万状，怕得要死，他们预感到自己的末日到了，便千方百计地破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们故意把生产和革命对立起来，始而以“抓生产”为名，来压制革命，反对抓革命；继而又以极“左”的面目出现，打着“抓革命”的旗号，煽动被他们蒙蔽的工人群众，离开生产岗位去“搞革命”，甚至搞什么“停工”、“罢工”。他们这两种手法都是打着“红旗”反红旗，都是公开对抗毛主席和党中央关于“抓革命，促生产”的指示。他们这样做的目的，是要挑起群众斗群众，制造大规模的生产事故，转移视线，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，保护他们自己。
    “抓革命，促生产”是毛主席亲自提出的一个极其重要的方针，一切革命的工人同志、红卫兵战士都热情宣传、坚决执行这一最高指示。目前我们一定要彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑——打着“抓革命”的旗号破坏生产，破坏文化大革命的阴谋。
    我们北京师大井冈山公社全体红卫兵战士和全体社员，坚决和广大的革命工人团结在一起，为贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，为粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新高潮而奋斗！
