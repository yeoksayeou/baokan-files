The year 1966 ended in the high tide of the Cultural Revolution. The year 1967 has arrived in the new high tide of the Cultural Revolution. On this precious day, re-reading Chairman Mao's 1949 New Year's address "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," feels particularly close to heart.

Chairman Mao's great thought of continuous revolution and carrying the revolution through to the end illuminated the path to the final victory of the Chinese people's liberation war 18 years ago, and today it again illuminates the path for the continued victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" is also the battle cry for carrying out the Cultural Revolution today.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already achieved great victories. However, in terms of the overall combat mission of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this is only the initial victory. The Cultural Revolution in schools is far from over, and the Cultural Revolution in factories and rural areas has just begun. We revolutionary Red Guards not only need to carry the Cultural Revolution in schools through to the end but also need to go to factories, to rural areas, and to wherever we are needed, to join the revolutionary masses there in carrying the Cultural Revolution throughout the country through to the end. The task is heavy and the road is long, and we must not relax our efforts.

In his brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," Chairman Mao introduces a Greek fable: A farmer in winter pitied a frozen snake, and after the snake revived, it bit the farmer to death. Chairman Mao then wrote: "Moreover, the big snakes and small snakes, black snakes and white snakes, snakes that bare their fangs and snakes that disguise themselves as beautiful women, which are coiled on most of China's land, although they have felt the threat of winter, have not yet been frozen stiff!" Now, aren't there still many poisonous snakes—those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party—who "have not yet been frozen stiff," that is, have not yet been overthrown, smashed, and exposed? Moreover, some have not even been exposed yet!

If we say that the "snakes" we face now are different from those in early 1949, it is that they all try their best to disguise themselves as not being snakes. They wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, wearing the cloak of Communist Party members to oppose the Communist Party. The enemy is more concealed and more cunning. How can we possibly eliminate these enemies without deeper and more arduous struggles? Therefore, we must not relax our vigilance but must press on and carry the revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao wrote in this brilliant work: "The Chinese people do not pity snake-like villains, and honestly believe that those who sing sweet songs about pitying such villains, saying that otherwise it would not be in accordance with national conditions or would not be great, are definitely not loyal friends of the Chinese people." Today, in the revolutionary ranks, are there any confused people who pity snake-like villains? If there are, these people should be alert: Like the farmer in the fable who does not distinguish between enemies and friends, pitying villains will meet with misfortune.

True revolutionaries are advocates of continuous revolution and thorough revolution. Today, as we study "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," we must "pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength, and do not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We must always maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit, be thorough revolutionaries, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    乘胜前进  革命到底
    一九六六年在文化大革命高潮中结束了。一九六七年在文化大革命的新高潮中到来了。在这可贵的日子里，重温毛主席写的一九四九年新年献词《将革命进行到底》，感到分外亲切。
    毛主席的不断革命、革命到底的伟大思想，十八年前照亮了中国人民解放战争最后胜利的道路，今天又照亮了无产阶级文化大革命继续胜利前进的道路。“将革命进行到底”，同样是今天进行文化大革命的战斗口号。
    无产阶级文化大革命，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，已经取得了很大的胜利。但是，按无产阶级文化大革命的整个战斗任务来说，这不过是初战告捷。学校的文化大革命还远未结束，工厂和农村的文化大革命才刚刚开展。我们革命的红卫兵，不但要把学校的文化大革命进行到底，还要到工厂去，到农村去，到一切需要我们的地方去，同那里的革命群众一起，把全国的文化大革命进行到底。任重而道远，我们决不能够松劲。
    毛主席在《将革命进行到底》这篇光辉著作中，介绍了一个希腊的寓言故事：一个农夫在冬天怜惜一条冻僵了的蛇，蛇苏醒以后就把这个农夫咬死了。毛主席接着写道：“况且盘踞在大部分中国土地上的大蛇和小蛇，黑蛇和白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇，虽然它们已经感觉到冬天的威胁，但是还没有冻僵呢！”现在，不是也有不少的毒蛇——党内走资本主义道路的当权派“还没有冻僵”，也就是还没有斗倒、斗垮、斗臭吗？况且有些还没有被揪出来呢！
    如果说我们现在面对的“蛇”和一九四九年初有什么不同的话，那就是他们都尽量把自己装扮成不像蛇的样子，他们打着红旗反红旗，披着共产党员的外衣反对共产党。敌人是更加隐蔽，更加狡猾了。不经过更深入更艰苦的斗争，怎么可能把这些敌人消灭呢？因此，我们绝不能松懈斗志，而是要再接再厉，革命到底。
    毛主席在这篇光辉著作中写道：“中国人民决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人，而且老老实实地认为：凡是耍着花腔，说什么要怜惜一下这类恶人呀，不然就不合国情、也不够伟大呀等等的人们，决不是中国人民的忠实朋友。”在今天，在革命队伍中，有没有“怜惜蛇一样的恶人”的糊涂人呢？如果有的话，这些人就应当提高警惕：像寓言中那样不分敌友的农夫，怜惜恶人，是会遭受恶报的。
    真正的革命者是不断革命论者，是彻底革命论者。今天，我们学习《将革命进行到底》，就要“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。我们一定要始终保持旺盛的革命精神，做一个彻底的革命派，把无产阶级文化大革命坚决进行到底！
