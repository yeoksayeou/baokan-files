Raise High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought
Smash the New Counterrevolutionary Onslaught of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line

Shanghai revolutionary rebel workers are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and daring to fight, dare to struggle, and dare to rebel. This is a scene of workers from the revolutionary rebel team of the experimental room of the Second Spinning Mill of Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill studying Chairman Mao's "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas."

Revolutionary students in Shanghai are actively going to factories and countryside, uniting with workers and peasants to form an invincible force, and fiercely counterattacking the new counterrevolutionary onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line! The picture shows some students from Fudan Middle School in Shanghai are putting up revolutionary slogans in the second converter workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant.

We are revolutionary rebels standing tall and firm. We must always guard our battle positions and resist the perverse and retrograde trends. Workers from the sixth loading and unloading area of the Shanghai Port Bureau, under the leadership of the revolutionary rebel team, are enthusiastically carrying out friendly production competitions between teams and classes.

Students from the revolutionary communes such as Dongfanghong of Beijing Geological Academy, while making revolutionary connections in the suburban countryside, together with revolutionary community members of the Red Star People's Commune, are studying the joint statement issued by various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, "Firmly Support the Revolutionary Peasant Movement, Thoroughly Smash Counterrevolutionary Economism! - A Letter to All the People of Shanghai." They are greatly inspired by this document and are determined to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively carry out the cultural revolution of the proletariat in the countryside.

Workers from the revolutionary rebel team of the plywood workshop of Chengdu Wood Processing Plant are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's directive of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," forming a new leadership team, and taking on the responsibility of production, gradually improving the production of the entire workshop. This is a scene of revolutionary rebel workers checking the quality of plywood.

Revolutionary rebel workers of Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill, under the great call of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, have risen up to seize power from the capitalist-roaders in the factory. The revolutionary rebel workers who have won the power seizure express their determination to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's great directive of "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" and vow to carry the cultural revolution of the proletariat through to the end. The picture shows revolutionary rebel workers in the weaving workshop actively producing.

The Ninth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Shenyang heard the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, and held discussions and published wall newspapers, expressing their most resolute support for the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and their determination to thoroughly smash the new counterrevolutionary onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line.
