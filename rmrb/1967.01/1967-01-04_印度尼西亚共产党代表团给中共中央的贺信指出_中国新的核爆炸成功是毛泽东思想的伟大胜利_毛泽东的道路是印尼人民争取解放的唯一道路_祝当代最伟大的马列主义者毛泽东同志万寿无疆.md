The Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee delegation, led by Yusuf Adjitorop, sent a congratulatory message to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the successful conduct of a new nuclear test by China.

The message said: "This nuclear test success is a brilliant and great victory for Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and a splendid achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This proves the rapid development of China's science and technology and the further strengthening of the national defense forces of the People's Republic of China. This is a great victory for all the people of the world, and it has become a powerful driving force for the people of all countries who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism for national liberation and independence."

The message said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and guided by Comrade Mao Zedong's correct Marxist-Leninist political line, the Chinese people have continuously achieved major successes in the field of science and technology. This once again proves that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become an invincible material force. Especially the great achievements in the field of nuclear weapons have caused uneasiness and fear among the imperialists and revisionists, while the people of the world and progressive humanity welcome this with great joy."

The message pointed out that the nuclear weapons of the People's Republic of China belong to all anti-imperialist people of the world. The message said: "We are fully convinced of this truth: in order to destroy nuclear weapons, revolutionary people must absolutely possess nuclear weapons. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: 'We are advocates of the annihilation of war, we do not want war; but we can only annihilate war through war, and we must take up arms if we do not want to be disarmed.'"

The message said: "The continuous achievements of the People's Republic of China in the development of nuclear weapons have greatly inspired the fighting spirit of the Indonesian people and made the Indonesian people more firmly believe that the seven hundred million Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought, are the most reliable reliance for the national liberation movement of the people of the world. The Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian revolutionary people are more convinced than ever that Mao Zedong Thought is invincible and can overcome all difficulties. Therefore, the road of Mao Zedong, the road of armed revolution against armed counter-revolution, the road of people's war, is the only road to overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and achieve the liberation of the Indonesian people."

The message pointed out that the great achievements of the People's Republic of China in the development of nuclear weapons are a heavy blow to the conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists to monopolize nuclear weapons, causing them to suffer a great defeat, and are a direct and great contribution to the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people and the people of the world.

Yusuf Adjitorop wrote in the concluding part of the letter: "Glory to Marxism-Leninism, glory to Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong!"

    印度尼西亚共产党代表团给中共中央的贺信指出
    中国新的核爆炸成功是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利  毛泽东的道路是印尼人民争取解放的唯一道路
    祝当代最伟大的马列主义者毛泽东同志万寿无疆
    新华社三日讯　中共中央收到了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团优素夫·阿吉托罗普祝贺我国成功地进行新的核爆炸的贺信。
    信中说：“这次核爆炸的成功是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌成果。这一事实证明中国的科学技术的迅速发展和中华人民共和国国防力量的更加强大。这是全世界人民的伟大胜利，并且成为正在为反对帝国主义和殖民主义以争取民族解放和独立而斗争的各国人民的强大的推动力。”
    信中说：“在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下，在毛泽东同志正确的马克思列宁主义的政治路线指引下，中国人民不断地在科学技术方面取得重大成就。”“这再一次证明了，毛泽东思想一旦掌握群众，就会变成不可战胜的物质力量。特别是在核武器方面的巨大成就，已经引起了帝国主义者和修正主义者的不安和恐惧，而全世界人民和进步人类对此则欢欣鼓舞地热烈欢迎。”
    信中指出，中华人民共和国的核武器是全世界反帝人民的所有物。信中说：“我们完全相信这个真理：为了销毁核武器，革命人民绝对需要拥有核武器，这正如毛泽东同志所说的：‘我们是战争消灭论者，我们是不要战争的；但是只能经过战争去消灭战争，不要枪杆子必须拿起枪杆子。’”
    信中说：“中华人民共和国在发展核武器方面所取得的一个又一个的成就，大大地鼓舞了印度尼西亚人民的战斗精神，并使印度尼西亚人民越来越坚信：在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党领导下和在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的七亿中国人民，是全世界人民的民族解放运动的最可靠的依靠。印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚革命人民更加深信，毛泽东思想是战无不胜的并且是能够克服一切困难的，因此，毛泽东的道路，武装的革命反对武装的反革命的道路，人民战争的道路，是为推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事政权和取得印度尼西亚人民的解放的唯一的道路。”
    信中指出，中华人民共和国在发展核武器方面的巨大成就，是对美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者垄断核武器的阴谋的沉重打击并使他们遭到巨大的失败，是对越南人民和全世界人民的革命斗争的直接的巨大贡献。
    优素夫·阿吉托罗普在信件的最后写道：“光荣归于马克思列宁主义，光荣归于毛泽东思想！”“祝当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志万寿无疆！”
