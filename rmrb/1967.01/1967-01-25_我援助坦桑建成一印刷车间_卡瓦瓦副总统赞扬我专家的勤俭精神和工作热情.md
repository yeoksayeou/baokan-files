China has assisted Tanzania in establishing a printing workshop equipped with a full set of modern printing machines made in China. On January 20, the second vice president of Tanzania, Mr. Kawawa, presided over the inauguration ceremony of the workshop at the government printing house in Dar es Salaam. The 20 modern printing machines are a gift from the Chinese government to Tanzania. These machines have been installed and put into production with the help of Chinese experts.

At the grand inauguration ceremony, Tanzanian workers were as joyous as during a festival. Some workers specially wore Chairman Mao's badges.

A Tanzanian worker said, "The Chinese experts work so hard and selflessly pass on their technology to Tanzanian workers. This is because they are trained by Chairman Mao."

In his speech, Kawawa expressed gratitude to the Chinese government for this assistance. He said that this assistance will greatly help in the development of Tanzania's printing industry and national construction. He particularly praised the Chinese experts' spirit of thrift and hard work. During their stay in Tanzania, the Chinese printing experts not only installed the new printing machines and passed on their technology to Tanzanian workers but also repaired some old printing machines that British engineers had deemed beyond repair.

Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania, He Ying, also spoke at the ceremony.

After the ceremony, Kawawa and others inspected the workshop equipped with Chinese machines and repeatedly praised the work of the Chinese experts and the Chinese-made machines.

　　我援助坦桑建成一印刷车间
　　卡瓦瓦副总统赞扬我专家的勤俭精神和工作热情
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　坦桑尼亚第二副总统卡瓦瓦二十日在这里主持了拥有中国制造的全套新式印刷机的坦桑尼亚政府印刷厂车间的落成典礼。二十台新式印刷机是中国政府赠给坦桑尼亚的礼物。这些机器已由中国专家帮助安装起来，投入生产。
    在隆重的落成仪式上，坦桑尼亚工人们像过节一样，兴高彩烈。有些工人特地佩戴着毛主席像章。
    一位坦桑尼亚工人说，中国专家那么辛勤地工作，无保留地把他们的技术传授给坦桑尼亚工人，这是因为他们是毛泽东主席教导出来的。
    卡瓦瓦在发表讲话时，表示感谢中国政府这一援助。他说，这一援助将大大有助于发展坦桑尼亚的印刷事业和国家建设。他特别赞扬中国专家的勤俭节约精神和工作热情。中国印刷专家在这里工作期间，不但安装了新的印刷机，把自己的技术传授给了坦桑尼亚工人，而且还修好了一些破旧的印刷机，这些机器按英国工程师的意见是没法再修理的了。
    中国驻坦桑尼亚大使何英也讲了话。
    仪式结束后，卡瓦瓦等人参观了用中国机器装备起来的车间，并一再赞扬中国专家的工作和中国制造的机器。
