The year 1966 was a truly extraordinary year. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved great victories. In this new year, we firmly believe that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will achieve even more glorious victories.

Is there any revolutionary leader in the world like our great leader Chairman Mao, who, in just over three months, received the revolutionary masses eight times, totaling more than ten million people? Chairman Mao! Only you have such great courage and determination, daring to launch this unprecedented, world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. You are the greatest revolutionary of the proletariat in contemporary times.

Every time Chairman Mao receives the revolutionary masses, he pushes the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a new height, giving immense strength and inspiration to hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. Countless revolutionary youths, nurtured by the great thought of Mao Zedong, have rapidly grown up. Take the revolutionary youths in our factory, for example; they are armed with the thought of Mao Zedong, fearing neither heaven nor earth, daring to make revolution and rebel. They are fighting against a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, destroying the "four olds" and establishing the "four news." Recently, they have launched a new high tide of exposing and criticizing the capitalist reactionary line.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great furnace for tempering and cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Our young generation has been tempered to be more red and more revolutionary in this furnace. With such strong and reliable successors, our socialist state will definitely be an iron-clad state that will never change color!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "You should pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We workers will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, daring to fight and pioneer not only on the production front but also in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. I will firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, support the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary youths, and fight shoulder to shoulder with them. We will resolutely oppose the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, resolutely oppose revisionism, and resolutely oppose imperialism. We will firmly defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line, uproot revisionism, and plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought deeply.

Chairman Mao's books are our revolutionary people's guide to action, source of strength, and weapon of struggle. Chairman Mao's revolutionary practice has also set a brilliant example for us. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution itself is the best classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. Among thousands of books, I will read Chairman Mao's books; among thousands of words, I will listen to Chairman Mao's words. I am determined to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially the "Three Constantly Read Articles." I will do as Chairman Mao says. I will follow Chairman Mao in making revolution all my life, tempering and transforming myself in great storms and waves, and forever be a good worker of Chairman Mao.

    文化革命是个大熔炉
    上海机床厂五好工人　张梅华
    一九六六年是很不平凡的一年。我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，取得了伟大的胜利。在新的一年里，我们坚信无产阶级文化大革命，一定能取得更辉煌的胜利。
    世界上有哪个革命领袖像我们伟大的领袖毛主席那样，在短短的三个多月的时间里，连续八次接见了一千多万文化革命大军！毛主席啊，毛主席！只有您才有这样巨大的魄力和决心，敢于发动这场震撼世界的史无前例的文化大革命。您是当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家。
    毛主席每次接见革命群众，都把无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新高潮，都给亿万革命群众以无比巨大的力量和鼓舞。千百万革命小将，在伟大的毛泽东思想哺育下，迅速地成长起来。就拿我们厂里的革命青年来说，他们用毛泽东思想武装起来，天不怕，地不怕，敢革命，敢造反。他们斗争一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，破“四旧”，立“四新”。最近，他们又掀起了揭发、批判资产阶级反动路线的新高潮。
    这场无产阶级文化大革命，是锻炼和培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的大熔炉。我们的青年一代，在这个熔炉中锻炼得更红，更加革命化了。我们有这样坚强可靠的后代，我们社会主义江山一定是铁打的江山，一定不会变颜色！
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们工人一定听毛主席的话，不但在生产战线上要敢干敢闯，更要在这场无产阶级文化大革命中当闯将。我要坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，支持革命青年的革命造反精神，和他们一起并肩战斗，大造党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造修正主义的反，大造帝国主义的反。坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，把修正主义的根子挖得干干净净，让毛泽东思想的根子扎得牢牢的。谁反对毛主席，谁反对毛泽东思想，不管他职位多高，资格多老，都要把他打倒。
    毛主席的书是我们革命人民行动的指南，力量的源泉，战斗的武器。毛主席的革命实践又给我们树立了光辉的榜样。无产阶级文化大革命，本身就是一所活学活用毛泽东思想的最好的大课堂。千种书，万种书，我要读的是毛主席的书；千句话，万句话，我要听的是毛主席的话。我决心进一步活学活用毛主席著作，特别是活学活用“老三篇”。毛主席怎么说，我就怎么干。我要一辈子跟着毛主席闹革命，一辈子在大风大浪中锻炼自己，改造自己，永远做毛主席的好工人。
