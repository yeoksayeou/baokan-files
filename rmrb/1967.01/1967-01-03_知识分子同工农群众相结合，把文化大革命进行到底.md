In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we welcome the year 1967. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, pushing our socialist revolution into a new stage. In a short period, the broad revolutionary masses, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have, with irresistible momentum, exposed a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, criticized those reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and reclaimed the positions they had long occupied.

Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, our political life, social landscape, and people's spiritual state are undergoing profound changes; industrial and agricultural production, science and technology, and other work have achieved brilliant successes.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing in a deeper and broader direction. The 90% of the national population who are workers and peasants have joined the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students have left the classrooms, gone to factories, and to the countryside, beginning to unite with the workers and peasants. The Cultural Revolution has expanded from schools and offices to factories and the countryside, marking the rise of a larger-scale mass revolutionary movement.

The history of our country since the May Fourth Movement has proven that revolutionary mass movements often start with student movements, move towards uniting with the workers and peasants, and form large-scale revolutionary movements of the workers and peasants. Today, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and achieve a comprehensive victory, revolutionary students and revolutionary intellectuals must follow the historical necessity, plan and organize to go to the factories and to the countryside, and unite with the workers and peasants to make revolution together.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Intellectuals, if they do not unite with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to unite with the workers and peasants."

The workers and peasants are the main force of the Cultural Revolution. Only by uniting with the workers and peasants, becoming one with them, and forming a vast and powerful cultural revolutionary army, can revolutionary students and revolutionary intellectuals, throughout the country, wage a people's war of cultural revolution. This will thoroughly eliminate all the old things of the exploiting classes in every corner of society, overthrow a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Only by carrying out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in society can the Cultural Revolution in schools and cultural circles be thoroughly completed and consolidated.

Only by uniting with the workers and peasants can revolutionary students and revolutionary intellectuals thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminate its pernicious influence. A small number of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line attempt to restore capitalism, shield capitalist roaders, and do not hesitate to suppress the masses, strike at the revolution, and incite the masses to fight each other. The workers and peasants, together with revolutionary students and revolutionary intellectuals, united under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, can completely isolate and thoroughly defeat the handful of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and seize the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary students and revolutionary intellectuals uniting with the workers and peasants can, in a broader scope, propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the Party's policies, and propagate the Sixteen Points on the Cultural Revolution; together with the workers and peasants, in the struggle, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, making Mao Zedong Thought more popular and deeply rooted in people's hearts, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and letting Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions. Thus, the entire country will become a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

"The masses are the real heroes, and we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous. Not understanding this, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." Revolutionary students and revolutionary intellectuals must put down their airs, learn from the workers and peasants, and be willing to be small students. They must learn the deep class feelings of the workers and peasants in their limitless love for Chairman Mao and their limitless admiration for Mao Zedong Thought, learn their firm stance of clear distinction between love and hate; learn their noble quality of selflessness, learn their fine tradition of loving labor and striving hard. They must truly become one with the workers and peasants, eat, live, and work together, unite together, and fight together. They must persist, stand the test, and model the Party's policies, observe the three main rules of discipline and the eight points for attention. They must learn to conduct investigations and research, not be self-righteous, and not take over everything. They must, together with the workers and peasants, discuss and solve problems encountered in the Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao calls on us: Students should focus on learning, but also learn other things, that is, not only learn literature but also learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue. We must certainly implement Chairman Mao's great call, thoroughly smash the capitalist, revisionist, and feudal goods in the ideological realm, and establish a new proletarian culture that matches the socialist economic base; cultivate ourselves into reliable successors who are both literate and martial, both workers and peasants. To implement Chairman Mao's great call, we must also go through uniting with the workers and peasants, participating in practical struggles, listening to the voices of the workers and peasants, understanding the demands of the workers and peasants, and thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in schools, and thoroughly reform teaching.

In the process of uniting with the workers and peasants, revolutionary students and revolutionary intellectuals must actively respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, with the spirit of "seizing the day," study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They must study the "Three Articles" as their motto, study to new heights, and use them to new heights; fiercely struggle against selfish and impure thoughts, and let the character of "public" shine brightly. They must resolutely oppose various bourgeois ideas, not for fame, not for profit, not fearing hardship, not fearing death, wholeheartedly for the revolution, completely and thoroughly for the people. They must, with the greatest self-awareness and the highest standards, reform their thinking and establish a proletarian worldview.

Chairman Mao says: "All the decaying ideological superstructures and other unsuitable parts of the superstructure are collapsing day by day. Thoroughly sweeping away these rubbish still needs time; the trend of their collapse is undoubtedly determined."

Looking at the domestic and international situation, the prospects are limitless. Under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, the seven hundred million Chinese people, full of spirit and fighting spirit, are engaged in a great cause that no one has ever done before, creating a new world of the proletariat illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought.

History has given the Chinese people an extremely great and glorious mission. Let us "make up our minds, not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory"!

The future belongs to us!

    知识分子同工农群众相结合，把文化大革命进行到底
    在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，迎来了一九六七年。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，把我国社会主义革命推向一个新的阶段。在短短的时间内，广大革命群众在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，以摧枯拉朽之势，揪出了一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，批判了那些资产阶级反动学术“权威”，夺回了他们长期盘踞的阵地。
    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我国的政治生活、社会面貌、人们的精神状态正在发生深刻的变化；工农业生产、科学技术和其他各项工作都取得了辉煌的成就。
    目前，无产阶级文化大革命正在向着更深入、更广阔的方面发展。占全国人口百分之九十的工农群众投入到无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中来了。革命师生走出了课堂，到工厂，到农村，开始和工农群众相结合。文化大革命从学校、机关扩展到工厂和农村，标志着更大规模的群众革命运动正在兴起。
    我国从“五四”以来的历史证明，革命的群众运动，往往是从学生运动开始，走向和工农群众相结合，形成大规模的工农群众革命运动。今天，广大革命学生、革命知识分子要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，夺取全面胜利，就要走历史的必由之路，有计划地有组织地到工厂去，到农村去，和工农群众一起闹革命。
    毛主席教导我们：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”
    工农群众是文化大革命的主力军。广大革命学生、革命知识分子只有和工农群众相结合，和他们变成一体，组成浩浩荡荡、坚强有力的文化革命大军，在全国范围内，打一场文化革命的人民战争，才能彻底破除社会各个角落的一切剥削阶级的旧东西，斗垮一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。只有把社会上的无产阶级文化大革命搞好了，学校和文化各界的文化大革命才能彻底完成，才能巩固下来。
    广大革命学生、革命知识分子只有和工农群众相结合，才能彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的恶劣影响。极少数顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，妄图复辟资本主义，包庇走资本主义道路的当权派，不惜镇压群众，打击革命，挑动群众斗群众。工农群众和革命学生、革命知识分子在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下联合起来，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就可以完全孤立和彻底打倒极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的最后胜利。
    广大革命学生、革命知识分子和工农群众相结合，可以在更广阔的范围内宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策，宣传文化革命的十六条；和工农群众一起，在斗争中进一步活学活用毛主席著作，使毛泽东思想更加普及，更加深入人心，促进人的思想革命化，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，从而把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
      “群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”广大革命学生、革命知识分子一定要放下架子，拜工农为师，甘当小学生。要学习工农群众无限热爱毛主席、无限崇拜毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情，学习他们爱憎分明的坚定立场；学习他们一心为公的高贵品质，学习他们热爱劳动、艰苦奋斗的优良传统。要真正做到和工农群众打成一片，和他们同吃、同住、同劳动，团结在一起，战斗在一起。要坚持下去，经受考验。要模范地执行党的政策，遵守三大纪律八项注意。要学会调查研究，不要自以为是，不要包办代替。要和工农群众一起商量解决文化大革命中遇到的问题。
    毛主席号召我们：学生以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。我们一定要实现毛主席的伟大号召，把意识形态领域里的资本主义、修正主义和封建主义的货色彻底砸烂，建立和社会主义经济基础相适应的无产阶级新文化；把自己培养成为能文能武、亦工亦农的革命的可靠接班人。我们要实现毛主席的这个伟大号召，也必须通过和工农群众相结合，参加了实际斗争，倾听了工农群众的呼声，了解了工农群众的要求，才能彻底搞好学校的斗、批、改，彻底改革教学。
    广大革命学生、革命知识分子在和工农群众结合的过程中，要积极响应林彪同志的号召，以“只争朝夕”的精神，活学活用毛主席著作。要把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，学出新水平，用出新水平；狠斗私心杂念，让“公”字大放光彩。要坚决反对形形色色的资产阶级思想，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心一意为革命，完全彻底为人民。要以最大的自觉、最高的标准改造自己的思想，树立无产阶级世界观。
    毛主席说：“一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。彻底扫除这些垃圾，仍然需要时间；这些东西崩溃之势已成，则是确定无疑的了。”
    放眼国内外，形势无限好。在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，七亿中国人民，意气风发，斗志昂扬，正在从事前人没有做过的事业，创造一个毛泽东思想光辉照耀的无产阶级新世界。
    历史赋予中国人民极其伟大、极其光荣的使命。让我们“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”！
    未来是属于我们的！
                                        （一月一日）
