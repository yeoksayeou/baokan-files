United We Stand
Shanggang Erchang Geming Zaofan Gongxue Lianhe Bingtuan

Some of our comrades from the Third Workshop of Shanggang Erchang have recently studied Chairman Mao's essay "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party." Reflecting on the formation of our united front, we have had many insights. The erroneous thoughts criticized by Chairman Mao in the Gutian Conference Resolution have also appeared in our minds recently.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has penetrated into industrial and mining enterprises, the broad masses of workers have enthusiastically participated in this movement. Just take our workshop as an example; several revolutionary rebel organizations were quickly established, such as "Red Spearhead," "Scaling Peaks," "Steel-Boned Lu Xun," "Iron Broom," and so on. The combat objectives of these organizations are the same: to launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois reactionary line of the factory party committee, bureau party committee, and Shanghai Municipal Committee. However, due to the serious "small groupism" among our various combat organizations, not only can we not fight together, but we often have conflicts, resulting in dispersed firepower and misdirected targets. This has seriously affected the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line and the progress of the entire cultural revolution.

As the cultural revolution continues to advance, to better concentrate our firepower against the bourgeois reactionary line, we increasingly feel the need for our combat organizations to unite. However, there are various forms of "small groupism" among us. Some think that their group is small and agile, making it convenient to act, and are unwilling to join the "large army"; some think that their group is large and powerful, looking down on the "small army"; others think that their group has a full complement of personnel, high morale, and daring spirit, ready to "conquer the world alone," and so on. In short, each combat organization emphasizes its own "characteristics," making it difficult to unite. However, the situation of the Cultural Revolution urgently requires us to unite quickly. What should we do? At this time, we studied the editorial article "The Revolutionary Masses Should Unite" from the Red Flag magazine and more seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party." Chairman Mao said: "To pay attention only to the interests of one's own small group and not to the interests of the whole, seemingly not for the individual but actually containing narrow individualism, also has a great corrosive and centrifugal effect." Chairman Mao also pointed out to us that the essence of small groupism is individualism. To correct it, we must "correct individualism from the ideological level." We think, we are all here to make revolution, to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and to fight against the bourgeois reactionary line. For the revolution, we are willing to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire. What individualistic things do we have that we are unwilling to give up? What reason do we have to emphasize our own independence? Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, after heated debates, we realized that for the revolutionary rebels, there are thousands of reasons to unite and not a single reason not to. To unite, we must, as Chairman Mao taught, "correct individualism from the ideological level," break private interests and establish public interests; to unite, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and highlight proletarian politics. In this way, through debates, we established the public interest, and all kinds of individualism disappeared! Our workshop finally achieved the great unity of the revolutionary rebels.

Since the revolutionary rebels united, everyone has learned from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and collectively brainstormed, making our struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road more powerful. Some of these power-holders saw us unite and became even more afraid. At the same time, we now also pay more attention to the strategy of struggle and begin to win over the majority. Now, in our workshop, the various rebel organizations are unprecedentedly united. This unity has laid the foundation for us to concentrate our firepower and strike the bourgeois reactionary line.

专栏：革命造反派战地

　　联合起来就是好
　　上钢二厂革命造反工学联合兵团
    我们上钢二厂三车间的一些同志，最近学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》一文，联系到我们联合兵团成立的前前后后，很有感触。毛主席在古田会议决议中所批判的某些错误思想，不久前也曾在我们的脑子里浮现过。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动深入发展到工矿企业以来，广大工人群众满腔热情地投入到这个运动中去。就拿我们车间来说，一下子就先后成立了好几个革命造反的群众组织，如
  “红色尖刀”、“攀险峰”、“硬骨头鲁迅”、“铁扫帚”等等。各战斗组织的作战目标是一致的，都是向厂党委、局党委以及上海市委的资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火。可是，由于我们各个战斗组织之间存在比较严重的“小团体主义”的思想，不但不能协同作战，还往往闹摩擦，以致火力不集中，矛头对不准，严重地影响了对资产阶级反动路线的批判，影响了整个文化革命运动的进展。
    随着文化革命运动的不断向前发展，为了更好地集中火力向资产阶级反动路线开火，我们越来越感觉到各战斗组织有联合起来的必要。但是在我们当中却存在着形形色色的“小团体主义”。有的认为自己人少精悍，行动方便，不愿意参加“大兵团”；有的认为自己人多势众，看不起“小兵团”；也有的认为自己人材齐全，干劲大，闯劲足，准备“独自打天下”，等等。总之，各个战斗组织都强调自己有“特点”，就是联合不起来。但是文化大革命的形势，迫切要求我们尽快联合起来。究竟怎么办？这时，我们学习了《红旗》杂志评论员的文章《无产阶级革命派联合起来》，更认真地学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作。毛主席说：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”毛主席还给我们指出，小团体主义的实质，就是个人主义。要纠正它，必须“从思想上纠正个人主义。”我们想，我们都是为了干革命，为了捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，向资产阶级反动路线开火而组织起来的。我们为了干革命，上刀山，下火海都愿意，我们还有什么个人主义的东西舍不得抛弃呢，还有什么理由去强调各自的独立性呢！我们根据毛主席的教导，经过激烈的辩论，认识到当前对革命造反派来说，要联合起来的理由有千条万条，不联合的理由一条都找不到。要联合起来，就必须按照毛主席教导，“从思想上纠正个人主义”，破“私”立“公”；要联合起来，就必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级的政治。就这样经过辩论，立了“公”字，形形色色的个人主义就滚蛋了！我们车间终于实现了革命造反派的大联合。
    自从革命造反派联合起来以后，大家互相取长补短，集思广益，使我们斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的火力更猛了。一些当权派的老爷们看见我们联合起来，也就更加害怕了。同时，我们现在也更加注意斗争的策略，也开始注意争取大多数。现在，在我们车间，各造反派组织之间空前地团结了。这个团结，为我们集中火力，痛击资产阶级反动路线，打下了基础。
