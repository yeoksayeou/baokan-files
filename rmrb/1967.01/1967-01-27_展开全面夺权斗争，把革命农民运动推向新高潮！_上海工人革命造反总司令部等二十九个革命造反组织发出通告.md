A stormy and violent peasant revolutionary movement is sweeping through the suburbs of Shanghai.

The Shanghai peasant movement arose in the midst of the initial unity of the proletarian revolutionary faction to launch a fierce struggle against the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. It surged to a climax after Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast the first "Letter to the People of the Entire City of Shanghai" and the "Emergency Notice" nationwide, and after the publication of the second "Letter to the People of the Entire City of Shanghai." It immediately took on the posture of a main force in the cultural revolution, stepping onto the stage of political history, and combining with the worker and student movements to engage in an unprecedented large-scale power seizure struggle.

Currently, the Shanghai peasant movement is surging forward, its momentum swift and powerful, its scale vast, and its momentum overwhelming. No counter-revolutionary or pro-imperialist forces can suppress it. The poor and lower-middle peasants and other revolutionary peasants, who dare to rebel, have raised high the great red flag of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, breaking through all the nets of counter-revolutionaries and revisionists, and swiftly advancing along the path to their own liberation. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings and, from the very beginning, have grasped the fundamental issue of the revolution, launching a life-and-death struggle for power against the authorities who are taking the capitalist road. The strongholds occupied by a handful of authorities taking the capitalist road and the diehard executors of the bourgeois reactionary line in the countryside will all be smashed by them; the remaining dregs and filth of the exploitative system that has lasted for thousands of years will all be swept away. The peasant movement's sharp edge is unstoppable, and those who follow it will survive, while those who oppose it will perish. All revolutionary factions feel an unprecedented sense of satisfaction, while all landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and monsters are terrified and feel that their end is near.

The rise of the peasant movement has disrupted the sweet dreams of the authorities taking the capitalist road. They have already sensed that they will be suddenly knocked off their pedestals and that their bosses will one by one be buried in the grave. They are terrified and desperate about the peasant movement, using counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics to make their final struggles. They first took to the battlefield bare-chested, using their party and political power to label revolutionary peasants who posted big-character posters against them as "counter-revolutionaries" and "bad elements," creating blacklists, investigating history, and doing their utmost to encircle, persecute, and suppress. But the revolutionary peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought are indomitable; they have broken through the obstacles and come out. A handful of authorities taking the capitalist road can only resort to their ancestral tricks: retreating to the background, spreading rumors, sowing discord, and even using clan relationships to stir up conflicts among the masses, inciting the masses to fight each other, protecting themselves to pass the test. They also shift the blame to others, inciting the uninformed masses to fight ordinary four-cleanup work teams, shifting the target of the struggle. They also use their financial power to engage in counter-revolutionary economism, issuing funds and checks indiscriminately, even distributing public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and reserve grain, destroying the socialist collective economy, and inciting a large number of uninformed peasants to leave their production posts and rush to the cities. They attempt to use the vicious methods of increasing urban pressure, shifting the target of the struggle, disrupting production, and disrupting supply to achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. When the revolutionary rebel peasants rise up to seize their power, they conspire to organize pro-imperialist organizations, using the banner of "poor and lower-middle peasants" and "revolutionary rebels" to play tricks, shoot dark arrows, create fake power seizures, preserve their forces, and wait for an opportunity to rise again. After these conspiracies fail, they are still unwilling to accept their failure and use the tactics of throwing away their hats and lying down to refuse to work, attempting to exert pressure on the revolutionary rebel peasants.

The development of the situation requires the revolutionary peasants to raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, quickly organize a class force with the poor and lower-middle peasants as the core, unite with revolutionary workers, students, cadres, and intellectuals, seize the power of the authorities taking the capitalist road, insist on "seizing the revolution and promoting production," eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside to final victory!

The rapid rise of the suburban peasant movement is a very important sign of the nationwide comprehensive development of class struggle. All revolutionary leftists must closely follow the new developments of the peasant movement, resolutely and unconditionally support all revolutionary actions of the revolutionary peasants, and quickly achieve the great alliance of the leftists of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and cadres. Revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals will all decide to abandon or take up the cause in the face of the peasant movement. All intellectuals who want revolution should quickly join the stormy and violent peasant movement to undergo tempering!

For this purpose, we issue the following notice, hoping that all revolutionary masses will follow it.

1. Revolutionary peasants must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of authorities within the party who are taking the capitalist road, the diehard executors of the bourgeois reactionary line, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. They must expose the tricks of a handful of people who shift the target of the struggle to the masses and ordinary four-cleanup work teams. They must strengthen the unity of the leftist forces, be good at winning over the masses who are temporarily deceived and do not understand the truth, organize a vast rebel army, and gradually achieve the unity of more than 95% of the masses and cadres, turning the countryside upside down and changing its old appearance.

2. The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. The broad masses of revolutionary peasants rise up to rebel, precisely to seize the power of the authorities taking the capitalist road. This power, seizing it is justified! Seizing it is good! Excellent! All power belongs to the revolutionary leftists. The countryside must immediately launch a comprehensive power seizure struggle. The revolutionary rebel factions in the countryside should unite and quickly organize a class force with revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants as the main body, establishing a leading core composed of revolutionary leftists and supported by the broad revolutionary masses. They must expose the tricks of a handful of people who play fake power seizures, be vigilant against class enemies who take advantage of the chaos to seize the leadership of the proletariat, and firmly grasp the power.

3. Revolutionary peasants must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," and be models of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." Revolutionary rebels should bravely shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, establish and improve the leading bodies of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," seize the revolution, and do a good job in production. The authorities at all levels in the countryside must, under the supervision of the revolutionary rebels, do a good job in production work and are not allowed to be passive and refuse to work. Revolutionary peasants should immediately take action, quickly launch a new winter production high tide, strive for a bumper harvest in 1967, and strive to complete the glorious task of supporting national construction.

4. Continue to fight, thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism. Revolutionary rebels should immediately take revolutionary actions to ensure that production materials, production funds, public accumulation, grain reserves, and other collective property are not damaged. Revolutionary peasants should be vigilant against a handful of people who attempt to use the methods of dividing, eating, and using everything up to destroy production, destroy the socialist economy, and destroy the proletarian cultural revolution. They should actively and proactively protect the socialist economy and not be deceived by a handful of authorities taking the capitalist road and class enemies. All production funds, public accumulation, reserve grain, etc., that should not have been distributed but have already been distributed should be discussed by the community members and necessary measures should be taken to retrieve them.

It is necessary to adhere to the revolutionary direction of workers supporting agriculture, cadres being sent down, and educated youth going to the countryside, and thoroughly smash the conspiracy of a handful of people who use the method of "resuming work" to incite the masses to leave the countryside, leave their production posts, rush to the cities, and shift the target of the struggle. Workers, cadres, and educated youth who have come to the city should immediately return to the countryside and make revolution on the spot.

It is necessary to resolutely repel the new attack of a handful of people who use money and material to tempt and corrupt revolutionary organizations. The leaders of all rebel factions should always stand on the front line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," practice streamlining and economizing in making revolution, and generally should not leave production.

5. Strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, allow only the leftists to rebel, and do not allow the rightists to overturn everything. Those who were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "saboteurs," etc., during the Cultural Revolution must be thoroughly and seriously rectified. But it is not allowed for cadres with serious problems during the four-cleanup movement to take the opportunity to reverse their cases. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are only allowed to behave themselves and are not allowed to cause trouble. If they take the opportunity to cause trouble and attempt to overturn everything, they must be firmly suppressed. The public security departments of counties and communes should strictly control them. The People's Liberation Army should strongly protect and support the rural revolutionary leftists and engage in power seizure struggles.

6. Revolutionary peasants should, in the struggle of the Cultural Revolution, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, take the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto, and work hard on the "use" of them, break private interests and establish public interests, carry out the thought revolution, and push the mass movement of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights.

7. Revolutionary workers should strongly support the revolutionary peasant movement, support agricultural production, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and make the enemy's conspiracy to sabotage the worker-peasant alliance never succeed! Revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals must, in an organized and planned manner, quickly join the revolutionary peasant movement, take the poor and lower-middle peasants as their teachers, and together with the revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, study Chairman Mao's works and walk the path of combining with workers and peasants. Oppose dictating and taking over. They should strongly propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate the "Sixteen Points" and the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao about the Cultural Revolution, and together carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside to the end, further promoting the arrival of a new high tide in agricultural production!

The proletarian revolutionary factions unite!

Launch a mass power seizure struggle!

Resolutely seize the power of all authorities taking the capitalist road!

Thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism!

Thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

Resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production"!

Workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres unite!

Carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary leftists!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    展开全面夺权斗争，把革命农民运动推向新高潮！
　　上海工人革命造反总司令部等二十九个革命造反组织发出通告
    新华社上海二十六日电　上海工人革命造反总司令部等二十九个革命造反组织在一月二十五日发出通告：《展开全面夺权斗争，把革命农民运动推向新高潮！》通告全文如下：
    急风暴雨式的上海革命农民运动正席卷着上海郊区各县。
    上海农民运动，是在无产阶级革命派初步联合起来迎头痛击资产阶级反动路线新反扑的大搏斗、大厮杀中兴起的，是在毛主席亲自决定向全国广播第一个《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》以后以及第二个《告上海全市人民书》发表后推向高潮的。它一兴起，就以文化革命的一支主力军的姿态，登上政治历史舞台，并和工人运动、学生运动相结合，投身到空前规模的夺权斗争中去。
    目前，上海农民运动风起云涌，其来势之迅猛，规模之宏大，声势之壮阔都是史无前例的，什么样的反革命、保皇力量都压抑不住。敢革命、敢造反的贫下中农和其他革命农民，高举起毛主席革命路线的伟大红旗，冲决一切反革命、修正主义的罗网，朝着自己解放自己的道路上迅跑。他们遵循着毛主席的教导，一开始就抓住了革命的根本问题，向走资本主义道路的当权派展开了你死我活的夺权斗争。农村中一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线的顽固执行者所盘踞的阵地将全部被他们冲毁；几千年来剥削制度遗留下来的残渣余孽、污泥浊水都将被他们扫除殆尽。农民运动的锋芒所向，锐不可挡，顺之者存，逆之者亡，一切革命派无不感到前所未有的痛快，一切地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神都吓得魂飞魄丧，感到了末日的到来。
    农民运动的兴起，搅乱了走资本主义道路当权派的酣梦，他们已预感到自己会一下子从台上被打翻在地，他们的老板也将一个个被葬入坟墓。他们对农民运动吓得要死、急得要命，施展了反革命的两面手法，做垂死的挣扎。他们先是赤膊上阵，凭着自己手中的党权、政权，把贴他们大字报的革命农民打成
  “反革命”“坏分子”，搞黑名单、查历史，竭尽围攻、迫害、镇压之能事。但用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命农民是压不倒的，他们顶着阻力杀出来了。一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派只好施出自己的祖传拿手好戏：退居幕后，造谣生非，挑拨离间，甚至利用宗族关系挑起群众的对立，挑动群众斗群众，保护自己过关。他们还嫁祸于人，煽动不明真相的群众围斗一般四清工作队员，转移斗争目标。他们又利用自己手中的财权，大搞反革命的经济主义，乱发资金、乱开支票，甚至分掉公积金、公益金、储备粮，破坏社会主义集体经济，煽动大批不明真相的农民离开生产岗位，涌向城市。妄图用增加城市压力、转移斗争目标、破坏生产、破坏供应的毒辣手段，达到他们破坏文化大革命的罪恶目的。当革命造反派农民起来夺他们的权之时，他们又阴谋策划，组织保皇组织，打着“贫下中农”“革命造反”的旗号，耍阴谋、放暗箭，制造假夺权，保存自己的势力，伺机东山再起。这些阴谋破产后，他们仍不甘心于自己的失败，又用掼纱帽，躺倒不干的手法，妄图对革命造反派的农民施加压力。
    形势的发展，需要革命农民更高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，迅速组织起以贫下中农为核心的阶级队伍，联合革命的工人、学生、干部和知识分子，大夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，坚持“抓革命，促生产”，肃清反革命经济主义的流毒，加强无产阶级专政，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统，把农村无产阶级文化大革命进行到最后胜利！
    郊区农民运动的迅猛兴起，是全国全面开展阶级斗争的一个极其重要的标志。一切革命左派都必须密切关注农民运动的新发展，坚决地、毫无保留地支持革命农民的一切革命行动，迅速实现工、农、兵、学、干的左派大联合。革命的、不革命的或者反革命的知识分子，都将在农民运动面前决定弃取，一切要革命的知识分子，火速投身到农民运动的急风暴雨中去经受锻炼吧！
    为此，我们特作如下通告，望全体革命群众遵照执行。
    一、革命农民一定要紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把斗争的矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子。要识破一小撮人所玩弄的转移斗争目标，把矛头指向群众和一般四清工作队员的阴谋诡计。要加强左派队伍的团结，善于争取受一时蒙蔽的不明真相的群众，组织一支浩浩荡荡的造反大军，逐步做到团结百分之九十五以上的群众和干部，把农村搞个天翻地覆，旧貌换新颜。
    二、革命的根本问题是政权问题。广大的革命农民起来造反，就是要夺走资本主义道路当权派的权。这个权，夺得有理！夺得好！好极了！一切权力归革命左派，农村必须立即展开全面夺权斗争。农村中的革命造反派联合起来、团结起来，迅速组织起一支以革命的贫农下中农为主体的阶级队伍，建立一个由革命左派组成的、为广大革命群众所拥护的领导核心。戳穿一小撮人玩弄的假夺权的鬼把戏，警惕阶级敌人趁机混水摸鱼，篡夺无产阶级领导权。牢牢掌住印把子。
    三、革命农民一定要坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，做“抓革命，促生产”的模范。革命造反派要勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，建立和健全“抓革命，促生产”的领导班子，抓好革命，搞好生产。农村的各级当权派，必须在革命造反派的监督之下，搞好生产工作，决不允许消极怠工，躺倒不干。革命农民要立即行动起来，迅速掀起冬季生产新高潮，力争一九六七年农业大丰收，努力完成支援国家建设的光荣任务。
    四、再接再厉，彻底肃清反革命经济主义的流毒。革命造反派应立即采取革命行动，保证生产资料、生产资金、公共积累、粮食储备等集体财产不受任何损失。革命农民要警惕一小撮人企图用分光、吃光、用光的手段，来破坏生产、破坏社会主义经济、破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶阴谋，积极、主动地维护社会主义经济，不要上一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和阶级敌人的当。凡属不应当分配而已经分配了的生产资金、公共积累、储备粮等，应由社员群众讨论，采取必要措施，设法追回。
    必须坚持工人支农、干部下放、知识青年上山下乡的革命大方向，彻底粉碎一小撮人用“复职复工”的手法来煽动群众离开农村、离开生产岗位，涌向城市，转移斗争目标的阴谋。已来城市的支农工人、下放干部、知识青年，应当立即打回农村去，就地闹革命。
    要坚决打退一小撮人用金钱、物质引诱、腐蚀革命组织的新进攻。各造反派组织的领导，要永远站在“抓革命，促生产”的第一线，实行精兵简政，节约闹革命，一般不要脱离生产。
    五、加强无产阶级专政，只许左派造反，不许右派翻天。对在文化大革命中被打成“反革命”、“破坏分子”等的革命群众，必须认真的、彻底的进行平反。但决不允许四清运动中有严重问题的干部趁机翻案。地富反坏右分子，只许老老实实，不许乱说乱动，如有趁机捣乱，妄图翻天者，坚决镇压。县、社公安部门应当对他们严加管制。希望人民解放军大力保护、支持农村革命左派，进行夺权斗争。
    六、革命农民要在文化大革命斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，在“用”字上狠下功夫，破私立公，搞好思想革命化，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向更高潮。
    七、革命工人要大力支持革命农民运动，支援农业生产，巩固工农联盟，使敌人破坏工农联盟的阴谋诡计永不得逞！革命学生、革命干部、革命知识分子必须有组织、有计划火速投入到革命农民运动当中去，拜贫下中农为师，和革命贫下中农一道学习毛主席著作，走与工农相结合的道路。反对指手划脚和包办代替。要大力宣传毛泽东思想，宣传十六条和党中央、毛主席关于文化大革命的指示，共同把农村无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，进一步促进农业生产新高潮的到来！
    无产阶级革命派联合起来！
    展开群众性的全面夺权斗争！
    坚决夺一切走资本主义道路的当权派的权！
    彻底打倒反革命的经济主义！
    彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针！
    工人阶级和贫下中农、革命学生、革命干部联合起来！
    把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    无产阶级革命左派大联合万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！
