The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry warns the Thai reactionary regime: Stubbornly acting as U.S. imperialist henchmen will lead to self-destruction. Willingly providing bases for U.S. B-52 bombers will invite retaliation.

Hanoi, January 15 — The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 14 strongly protesting the Thai reactionary regime's allowing the United States to establish B-52 bomber bases on Thai territory.

The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism's establishment of strategic air bases on the Asian mainland represents a highly serious new step in strengthening and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam. This directly threatens the peace and security of the countries in Southeast Asia and is a brazen provocation to all peace-loving and justice-seeking people.

The statement strongly protests the Thai reactionary regime's allowing the United States to establish strategic air bases on Thai territory, declaring this to be a war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people will resolutely take necessary measures to retaliate against this unjustified act of war. The Thai reactionary regime must bear full responsibility for all consequences arising from its criminal actions.

The statement calls on the governments and peoples of the Indochinese countries, as well as the governments and peoples of Asia and the world who love peace, to resolutely condemn the military collusion between the U.S. government and the Thanom-Praphas regime, and to stop their crimes of strengthening and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam.

According to a report from Bangkok, Thai newspapers stated that the head of the Thai traitorous clique, Praphas, openly declared on January 12 that he agreed to allow U.S. B-52 bombers to be stationed in Thailand. He also boasted: "Thailand provides air bases for U.S. B-52 aircraft to take off and land, to 'facilitate' (these aircraft) bombing North Vietnam."

Early last year, high-ranking U.S. officials revealed that the United States had long ago formulated a plan to station B-52 bombers in Thailand. The United States also completed the Utapao Airport in the Thai base of U-Tapao last year, which can be used by these bombers. The purpose of the United States in doing so is to greatly shorten the flight distance of U.S. B-52 bombers bombing Vietnam's South and North. War criminal Johnson and U.S. Secretary of State Rusk, during their activities in Thailand last year, used high pressure and bribery tactics on the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique regarding this issue.

    越南外交部警告泰国反动当局：
    死心塌地当美帝帮凶必自取灭亡
    甘愿为美国B—52型轰炸机提供基地将遭还击
    新华社河内十五日电　越南民主共和国外交部十四日发表声明，强烈抗议泰国反动当局让美国在泰国领土建立B—52型飞机基地的战争行动。
    声明指出，美帝国主义在亚洲大陆建立战略飞机基地，在加强和扩大侵越战争中又迈出了极其严重的新的一步，它直接威胁了东南亚地区各国的和平与安全，是对一切爱好和平和主持正义的人们的一种蛮横的挑衅。
    声明强烈抗议泰国反动当局让美国在泰国领土上建立战略飞机基地的行动，并且宣布这是反对越南民主共和国和越南人民的战争行动。越南人民坚决采取必要的措施，还击这一无理的战争行动。泰国反动当局必须对由于它的罪恶行动所产生的一切后果承担责任。
    声明呼吁印度支那各国政府和人民，以及亚洲和全世界爱好和平的各国政府和人民，坚决谴责美国政府同他侬—巴博统治集团之间的军事勾结，并且制止它们加强和扩大侵越战争的罪行。
    据新华社十五日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，泰国卖国集团的头目巴博十二日明目张胆地宣布，他同意让美国B—52型轰炸机进驻泰国。他还公然叫嚣：泰国提供空军基地给美国B—52型飞机起落，以“便利（这些飞机）轰炸北越”。
    美国高级官员去年初透露，美国早就制订了派B—52型飞机进驻泰国的计划。美国并且在去年在泰国的梭桃邑基地建成了可供这种轰炸机使用的乌塔保机场。美国这样做的目的是要大大缩短美国B—52型飞机轰炸越南南方和北方的航程。战争瘟神约翰逊和美国国务卿腊斯克去年到泰国活动时，曾就这个问题向他侬—巴博卖国集团玩弄高压和收买手段。
