With the development of revolutionary forces in Shanghai, the newly emerged, revolutionary *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* have appeared. This is a victory of the proletarian revolutionary line over the bourgeois reactionary line. This is a major event in the development of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great revolution.

	Hotly Welcome the Birth of the New *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily*

The *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* of Shanghai have been reborn in the stormy class struggle. These two newspapers appear before the readers with a new and revolutionary face. The broad revolutionary masses unanimously applaud and cheer. Here we reprint several articles by readers welcoming the birth of the new *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily*. — Editors

	Pledge to Be Your Strong Backing

Dear comrades of the "Spark Igniting the Plains Afire" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters:

	You have struggled hard and finally seized the power of the *Wenhui Daily*. This is a new victory of Mao Zedong Thought; this is a new victory of the Shanghai proletarian Great Cultural Revolution. The entire revolutionary rebel workers of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and the red rebel fighters of the Harbin Military Engineering Institute express our warmest congratulations to you.

	Newspapers are one of the tools for one class to exercise dictatorship over another class. However, the old *Wenhui Daily* has long refused to implement Chairman Mao's newspaper policy; it does not propagate Mao Zedong Thought; and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has unconditionally implemented a bourgeois reactionary line, becoming a tool of bourgeois dictatorship. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without removal, there can be no progress; without stopping, there can be no advance." Such a newspaper must be smashed, and its power must be seized. You have done well in your rebellion! You have done well in seizing power! We, the red rebels, firmly support your great revolutionary action and pledge to be your strong backing. We firmly believe that the *Wenhui Daily* in the hands of the revolutionary rebels will definitely be run better; it will definitely become a stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. A new *Wenhui Daily* will definitely appear before us!

	Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	Long live the victory of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

	Yours in revolutionary rebellion,
	Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters
	Harbin Military Engineering Institute Red Rebel Team Liaison Station in Shanghai

    随着上海市革命力量的发展，崭新面貌的、革命的《文汇报》和《解放日报》出现了。这是无产阶级革命路线反对资产阶级反动路线的胜利产物。这是我国无产阶级文化大革命发展史上的一件大事。这是一个大革命。
    ——热烈欢呼《文汇报》和《解放日报》新生
    上海《文汇报》和《解放日报》在阶级斗争的急风暴雨中新生了。这两家报纸以崭新的、革命的面貌出现在读者面前。广大革命群众一致叫好，拍手称快。这里转载的是读者欢呼《文汇报》和《解放日报》新生的几篇文章。——编者
    誓做你们的坚强后盾亲爱的“星火燎原”革命造反总部的战友们：
    你们经过艰苦奋斗，终于把《文汇报》的大权夺过来了。这是毛泽东思想的新胜利；这是上海无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。我们工人造反总司令部的全体革命造反工人和哈军工的红色造反战士向你们致以最热烈的祝贺。
    报纸，是一个阶级对另一个阶级实行专政的工具之一。可是旧《文汇报》长期以来拒不执行毛主席的办报方针；不宣传毛泽东思想；在无产阶级文化大革命中又不折不扣地执行了一条资产阶级反动路线，成了资产阶级专政的工具。毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。像这样的报纸就是要砸烂，就是要夺权。你们这个反造得好！你们这个权夺得对！我们红色造反者坚决支持你们的这一大无畏的革命行动，誓做你们的坚强后盾。我们坚信：《文汇报》在革命造反派手里，一定能办得更好，它一定能成为宣传毛泽东思想的坚强阵地。一个新《文汇报》一定会在我们面前出现！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    以毛主席为代表的革命路线胜利万岁！
                              此致
    革命造反的敬礼
