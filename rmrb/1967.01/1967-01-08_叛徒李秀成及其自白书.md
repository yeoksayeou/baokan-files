In 1851, Chinese revolutionary peasants rose up against the feudal rule of the Qing Dynasty and national oppression in Guiping County, Guangxi Province, at Jintian Village, proclaiming the establishment of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Li Xiucheng was an important general of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in its later period. Shortly after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising, he was swept into the revolutionary tide. Initially, he was a soldier, but gradually he was promoted. By 1859, he was even granted the title of "Zhong Wang" (Loyal King). After 1862, Li Xiucheng became the de facto highest leader of the Taiping Army. However, the "Loyal King" was not loyal. In 1864, when Tianjing fell, Li Xiucheng was captured. After being captured by the Qing army, Li Xiucheng could not withstand the test and betrayed the peasant revolution of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, becoming a despicable traitor. In the enemy's prison, Li Xiucheng wrote a confession that will be infamous for eternity. In this confession, he repeatedly flattered the enemy and insulted the revolution. He described the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, this unprecedented great peasant revolution in Chinese history, as "going against the mandate of heaven," "the calamity of the world," and "the harm to the people." He described those who participated in the revolution as "rebels," "unfilial, unrighteous, and unrighteous people," and "bandits who harm the people and the masses." He also slandered the revolutionary leader of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Hong Xiuquan, as a "foolish ruler" who "does not care for the military and the people" and "does not govern with virtue." Regarding the Qing Emperor and the leader of the Hunan Army, Zeng Guofan, who resolutely suppressed the peasant revolution, Li Xiucheng shamelessly praised them as "blessings," as the "sage" who follows the "mandate of heaven," as "benevolent and kind to all quarters, with a heart of virtue and enlightenment," and as "unparalleled in the world." His attitude towards revolution and counter-revolution is so despicable! Moreover, Li Xiucheng eagerly provided strategies for the enemy, aiming to completely disintegrate the large number of Taiping Army in the south of the Yangtze River. For this purpose, he proposed the so-called "Ten Points for Surrender" in his confession, begging the Qing rulers to spare his dog's life, so that he could persuade the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary army to lay down their weapons and surrender en masse. He was also prepared to become a running dog of the ruling class after the entire army surrendered, helping the enemy to exterminate the "Nian Army" in the north who were supporting the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary struggle. His traitorous face is so vicious and despicable! However, Li Xiucheng's groveling did not gain the enemy's sympathy, and he was still executed. This is the despicable end of the traitor Li Xiucheng.

Among the revolutionary soldiers of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, although there were traitors like Li Xiucheng, many people maintained their revolutionary integrity and were "spirited." Among the leaders of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, people like Chen Yucheng, Hong Renfan, and Lai Wenliang, after being captured by the enemy, all chose to die rather than surrender, showing the true spirit of revolutionary heroes. Particularly moving was that in 1858, the Taiping Army general Lin Qirong led more than seventeen thousand Taiping soldiers to defend Jiujiang City, engaging in fierce street battles and all perishing heroically. Just before Li Xiucheng's surrender to the enemy, when Nanjing fell, more than ten thousand Taiping soldiers chose to burn themselves to death rather than surrender to the enemy. Comparing these heroic deeds with Li Xiucheng, one can see even more clearly the despicable face of this traitor.

For a long time, the bourgeois historians, with Hu Shi, the American lackey, as their representative, have tried to portray the traitor Li Xiucheng as a "hero," advocating their slave philosophy to corrupt the will of the revolutionary people. The likes of Zhou Yang, following Hu Shi's bourgeois reactionary thoughts, have tried to portray such a great traitor as Li Xiucheng as a "revolutionary hero" and to portray such a confession as a "revolutionary document," completely reversing the boundaries between revolutionaries and traitors. Their purpose in doing so is to defend their own surrenderism and to defend their own traitorous history.

    叛徒李秀成及其自白书
    一八五一年，中国革命农民为了反对清朝封建统治和民族压迫，在广西省桂平县的金田村起义，宣布成立“太平天国”。李秀成曾经是太平天国后期的重要将领。他在太平天国起义以后不久，被卷入了革命的洪流。开始是当兵，后来逐渐地被提拔起来。至一八五九年，他还被封为“忠王”。一八六二年后，李秀成实际上成了太平军的最高领导人。然而，“忠王”不忠。一八六四年，天京陷落，李秀成被俘。李秀成作了清军俘虏以后，经不起考验，就背叛了太平天国的农民革命，成了一个可耻的大叛徒。李秀成在敌人的囚笼里，写下了一个遗臭万年的自白书。他在这个自白书中，一而再、再而三地阿谀敌人，辱骂革命。他把太平天国这一场中国历史上空前伟大的农民革命，竟说成是“违反天命”、“世人之劫数”、“乱坏世民”的“患害”；把参加革命的人，竟说成是“作乱之人”、“不良不孝不义之徒”和“害民害众”的“众匪”。他还污蔑太平天国革命领袖洪秀全是“不以军民为念”、“不修德政”的“昏君”。对于清朝皇帝和坚决镇压农民革命的湘军头子曾国藩，李秀成竟无耻地称颂他们是“福德”，是顺应“天命”的“圣上”，是“仁爱惠四方，兼有德化之心”、“盖世无双”的伟人。他对革命和反革命的态度是如此可鄙！此外，李秀成还极力为敌人出谋划策，要彻底瓦解大江南北的大量太平军。为此，他在这个自白书里提出了所谓“招降十要”，乞求清朝统治者饶了他的狗命，由他去劝诱太平天国革命军放下武器，集体投降。他还准备在全军投降以后，去当统治阶级的走狗，帮助敌人去剿灭正在北方支持太平天国革命斗争的阶级兄弟“捻军”。他的叛徒嘴脸是如此狠毒可耻！然而，李秀成的摇尾乞怜并没有得到敌人的同情，他还是被杀了。这就是李秀成这个大叛徒的可耻下场。
    在太平天国革命将士们中间，虽然也出现了李秀成这样的叛徒，但是许许多多人都坚持了革命气节，是“有骨气的”。太平天国的领导人中，像陈玉成、洪仁玕、赖文光等，在被敌人俘虏以后，都宁死不屈，表现出真正革命英雄的气概。特别令人感动的是：一八五八年，太平军将领林启容，率领一万七千多名太平军，保卫九江城，与敌人进行了英勇的巷战，全部壮烈牺牲。就在李秀成向敌人乞降以前，南京城破时，守城的一万多太平军，许多人情愿集体自焚，也不投降敌人。将这些英勇事迹和李秀成对比起来，更可以看出这个叛徒的可耻面目。
    长期以来，资产阶级的史学“权威”们，以美帝洋奴胡适为代表，竭力把李秀成这个叛徒打扮成为“英雄”，宣扬他们的奴才哲学，以达到腐蚀革命人民意志的目的。周扬之流禀承胡适的这套资产阶级反动思想，竭力把李秀成这样的一个大叛徒说成是“革命英雄”，把这样的一个自白书说成是“革命文献”，完全颠倒了革命者与叛徒的界限。他们这样做的目的，就是要为他们自己的投降主义作辩护，为他们自己的叛徒历史作辩护。
