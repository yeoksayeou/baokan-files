When we heard from the radio about the congratulatory telegram sent by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel groups in Shanghai, we couldn't help but feel overjoyed with tears of happiness and boiling blood. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you are the reddest sun in the hearts of us peasants. At this critical moment when the struggle between the two lines in Shanghai is entering a decisive battle, you have issued the highest directive, which is the greatest encouragement and support for us revolutionaries!

Currently, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and those who stubbornly carry out the bourgeois reactionary line in Shanghai, seeing that they are about to be finished, have come up with a set of conspiracies and tricks. They use economism to deceive the masses, inciting some peasants who do not understand the truth to demand economic benefits and leave their production posts, attempting to shift the direction of the struggle and achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We revolutionaries bravely stand at the forefront of the struggle and engage in a head-on battle with them, smashing their new counterattack. Through the struggle, many poor and lower-middle peasants have opened their eyes, exposed their conspiracies, and realized that this is their attempt to use material incentives to lure us onto the revisionist path. If we let their conspiracy succeed, we poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer again.

Dear Chairman Mao! We revolutionaries will definitely firmly follow your directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" and carry both the burdens of revolution and production. We will definitely grasp the major direction of the struggle, directing our spears at a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few who stubbornly carry out the bourgeois reactionary line. At the same time, we revolutionaries will definitely unite all revolutionary peasants and guard our production posts. Currently, we should mainly focus on applying winter fertilizer to wheat and rapeseed fields and accumulating fertilizer for the winter. We will achieve victories in both revolution and production, thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

    一定牢牢掌握斗争的大方向
    当我们从广播里听到了中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电，禁不住高兴得热泪盈眶，热血沸腾。毛主席啊毛主席，您是我们农民心中最红最红的红太阳。当上海市两条路线的斗争进入大决战的关键时刻，您向我们发出了最高指示，这是您老人家对我们革命造反派的最大鼓舞，最大支持！
    目前，上海一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，眼看自己快要完蛋了，又想出了一套阴谋诡计，用经济主义来欺骗群众，怂恿一部分不明真相的农民起来闹经济福利，离开生产岗位，企图以此来转移斗争大方向，达到他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。我们革命造反派勇敢地站在斗争的最前线，和他们开展了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了他们的新反扑。经过斗争，我们许多贫下中农擦亮了眼睛，戳穿了他们的阴谋，认识到这是他们企图用物质刺激引诱我们走上修正主义的邪路。如果让他们的这个阴谋得逞，我们贫下中农就要吃第二遍苦。
    敬爱的毛主席！我们革命造反派一定要坚决遵照您老人家提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，挑好革命、生产两副担子。我们一定要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把矛头对准一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人。同时，我们革命造反派一定要团结一切革命的农民，坚守生产岗位。当前，主要抓紧在三麦、油菜田上追施腊肥，开展冬季积肥等农活。我们要夺取革命、生产双胜利，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
