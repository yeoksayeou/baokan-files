A winter morning in Beijing, Tiananmen Square is filled with a festive atmosphere. Despite the chilling wind, the Red Guards from all corners of the country have hearts burning with passion. They long to be by Chairman Mao's side and leave a photograph in Tiananmen Square.

"The sun is out! Everyone, get ready." The people waiting to take photographs are overjoyed. In the line, two Red Guards from Guangxi leap with excitement. They quickly help each other adjust the Chairman Mao badges and quotations pinned to their chests. The taller Guangxi comrade felt that taking a photograph by Chairman Mao's side must be done with utmost spirit, so he took off his cotton coat. At the photographer's signal, he quickly stepped forward, pressing the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to his chest, and gazed deeply at Chairman Mao's portrait on Tiananmen, taking the photograph. The other Guangxi Red Guard, just as he had posed, suddenly remembered something and rushed back to instruct the photographer, "It doesn't matter if I look good or not, but Tiananmen must be photographed completely, and the portrait of our red sun, Chairman Mao, must be clear."

Why is the third bridge in the radiant sunlight particularly lively? Pushing through the crowd to see, it turns out that a soldier is taking photographs of a group of Xinjiang comrades on the bridge! The young people, one by one, face the morning sun, holding up the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," standing under Chairman Mao's portrait. From their faces, filled with boundless excitement, one can see how proud and happy they are!

Whether they are Red Guards from the foot of the Tian Mountains or revolutionary youth from the banks of the Zhujiang River, why do they always want to take photographs on the bridge in front of Tiananmen? It turns out that on the night of National Day, our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, sat on this bridge to watch the fireworks with the people. The next day, the good news spread! Since then, Red Guards from all over the country have been continuously coming to the bridge where Chairman Mao sat to take photographs. The young people say, "The place where Chairman Mao sat is the warmest, and taking photographs here is the happiest!" No wonder these Xinjiang comrades, after taking photographs, still do not want to leave the bridge!

After Chairman Mao's Reception

In 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao inspected the Red Guards and revolutionary students eight times at Tiananmen. Every brick, every bit of red soil, and every leaf at Tiananmen are treasured by the Red Guards, for these are things from Chairman Mao's side! After each reception, how many people were so excited that they stayed up all night? How many people sat on the bridge at night, singing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" over and over, gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait on Tiananmen? How many people stayed up all night at Tiananmen, waiting to take the most precious photograph the next day? Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, with a thousand words and ten thousand words, how can one express the boundless love and admiration of the revolutionary youth for you!

One early morning, under the East Viewing Stand of Tiananmen, a Red Guard dressed in a green military uniform was sitting. A red sash with "Shanghai Delegation to Beijing" was fluttering on his chest. As soon as he saw the photographer, he jumped up and pulled the photographer excitedly, saying, "Comrade, do you know? I saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao right here yesterday. This is the greatest happiness of my life. I want to share my happiness with you. I want to take a photograph where I saw Chairman Mao. Do you think that's okay?"

This Shanghai youth, since seeing Chairman Mao at the East Viewing Stand of Tiananmen the previous afternoon until this morning, had not left this place! He sat where he had seen Chairman Mao, facing Chairman Mao's portrait on Tiananmen, with tears of happiness, under the light of Tiananmen, writing a letter the whole night. He reported to his classmates and friends, "Chairman Mao's health is extremely, extremely good. This is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and the people of the world revolution. Now, I am sitting in the place where I saw Chairman Mao writing to you..."

The photographer, seeing the Red Guards' love for our great leader Chairman Mao, with tears of excitement, took the most precious photograph for this Shanghai Red Guard.

The photographs taken in front of Tiananmen, by Chairman Mao's side, will be like bright red lamps, guiding the Red Guards to firmly defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, inspiring the youth to overcome countless difficulties on the revolutionary long march, and welcome one glorious victory after another!

Being a Good Host for Chairman Mao

One noon, photographer Old Chen was busy taking photographs for the Red Guards. Suddenly, a little girl, panting, ran over and said, "Please take a special photograph for a few blind people." Old Chen mistakenly thought the little girl wanted to take a photograph, so he smiled and comforted her, saying, "Everyone in line is busy, who doesn't want to take a photograph quickly? You wait a bit." The little girl pointed to the front and shouted, "I am a Beijing Red Guard, not taking a photograph myself, but a few comrades who are blind want to take a photograph urgently!" Old Chen looked up and indeed saw six blind female students not far away.

The photographer quickly brought them into the scene. The Red Guards waiting to take photographs also enthusiastically shouted, "Let them take photographs first, we don't mind waiting a bit." Old Chen saw the Red Guards treating their class sisters with such enthusiasm, and his heart was filled with joy. He carefully arranged the composition for them over and over, first letting the six girls stand in a row, then letting three girls squat down, and the other three stand behind them, until he was satisfied, he prepared to take the photograph. Unexpectedly, these female students were still a bit worried, repeatedly telling Old Chen, "It's not easy for us to come from Qingdao to Beijing. If it weren't for our most beloved leader Chairman Mao personally initiating this proletarian cultural revolution, we definitely wouldn't be able to come to Beijing. You must photograph Tiananmen's Chairman Mao's portrait well, so our classmates at home can also see Chairman Mao."

Old Chen affectionately said to them, "You are guests invited by Chairman Mao, we must take a good photograph for you. Now, behind you is the Tiananmen of our great motherland, and above your six heads, in the center, is the portrait of our red sun, Chairman Mao in our hearts..." Hearing this, a few female students hugged each other in joy, and they simultaneously took out the shining red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from their pockets. To ensure their complete satisfaction and to guarantee a good photograph, photographer Old Chen specially took two photographs.

As they were leaving, the six blind female students extended their hands, tightly holding Old Chen's hand, saying, "Thank you for taking this most meaningful photograph for us. Under the leadership of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, our motherland is full of relatives, and everywhere there is the warmth of the Party. Here, you photographers are our relatives." They repeatedly asked about the photographer's name, and Old Chen smiled, saying, "We are also from all over the country. We are Chairman Mao's hosts."

    在毛主席身边留个影
    葛映
    在毛主席坐过的地方照相
    冬季的早晨，北京天安门广场呈现出一片欢腾的景象。尽管寒风刮得有些冷，但是来自祖国四面八方的红卫兵小将的心比火还热，他们非常想在毛主席身边，在天安门广场上留个影。
    “太阳出来啦！大伙儿快准备。”等候照相的人们多高兴呀。队伍里，两个广西红卫兵兴奋得一蹦老高。他们连忙相互帮着摆正佩戴在胸前的毛主席像章和毛主席语录章。那位个子高些的广西同学觉得在毛主席身边的地方照相必须十分精神，特意脱下了身上的棉大衣。听到摄影员一声招呼，他马上一个箭步跨过去，把红艳艳的《毛主席语录》紧贴在胸前，深情地望着天安门上的毛主席像照了相。另一位广西小红卫兵刚摆好姿势，忽然想起一件事，急忙跑回来嘱咐摄影员：“我照得好不好都没关系，天安门可得照完整，我们心中的红太阳毛主席像千万要照清楚。”
    笼罩在灿烂阳光中的第三座金水桥上，为什么显得格外热闹？挤进人丛看看，原来桥上有位解放军正给一群新疆同学摄影呢！年青人一个个都迎着朝阳，举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，站立在毛主席像下面。从一张张无比激动的笑脸上，看出他们是多么自豪，多么幸福啊！
    无论是来自天山脚下的红卫兵，还是来自珠江两岸的革命青年，为什么总爱到天安门前的金水桥上留影呢？原来，国庆之夜，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席就在这座金水桥上席地而坐，同群众在一起观看节日焰火。第二天，喜讯一下传开啦！从此，来自各地的红卫兵就川流不息地来到毛主席坐过的金水桥上留影了。年青人说：“毛主席坐过的地方最温暖，在这儿照相最幸福！”难怪这些新疆同学照相以后还一直不愿离开金水桥呢！
    在毛主席接见以后
    一九六六年，我们伟大领袖毛主席八次在天安门检阅红卫兵和革命师生。天安门的一块砖石，一撮红土，一片树叶，红卫兵小将都十分珍惜，因为这些都是毛主席身边的东西啊！每次接见以后，有多少人激动得彻夜不眠。有多少人深夜坐在金水桥上一遍遍唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，久久地凝视着天安门上的毛主席像。又有多少人整夜留在天安门等候第二天照一张最珍贵的相。毛主席啊，毛主席，纵有千言万语，又怎能说尽革命小将对您的无限热爱，无限崇拜！
    一天清早，在天安门东观礼台下，坐着一位身着草绿色军衣的红卫兵。他的胸前飘拂着一个“上海市赴京代表”红绸条。他一见摄影员，猛地就跳起来，一把拉住摄影员兴奋地说：“同志，你知道吧，我昨天就在这个地方见到了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，这是我一生最大的幸福。咱们的毛主席红光满面，身体可健康啦！希望你也来分享我的幸福。我要站在见过毛主席的地方照张相，你看行吗？”
    这位上海青年自从昨天下午在天安门东观礼台下见到毛主席以后，直到这天早晨，还没有离开过这块地方呢！他就坐在见过毛主席的地方，面对着天安门上的毛主席像，含着幸福的泪花，就着天安门前的灯光，写了整整一夜信。他向他的同学和亲友报告：“毛主席的身体非常非常健康，这是中国人民和世界革命人民的最大幸福。现在，我就坐在见到毛主席的这块地方给你们写信……”
    摄影员看到红卫兵小将这样热爱我们的伟大领袖毛主席，他含着激动的泪花，给这位上海红卫兵照了一张最珍贵的相。
    在天安门前，在毛主席身边照下的一张张无比珍贵的相，将像一盏盏明亮的红灯，指引着红卫兵小将坚决捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，鼓舞着青年一代在革命的长征路上，战胜千险万难，迎来一个个更加辉煌的胜利！
    做毛主席的好接待员
    一天中午，摄影员老陈正在忙碌地给红卫兵小将照相。突然，一个小姑娘气喘吁吁地跑来说：“请您给照个特殊相，是几个盲人。”老陈误以为这个小姑娘自己要照相，就笑眯眯地安慰她说：“排队的同志都是忙人，谁不急着照相呢？你待会儿照吧。”小姑娘指指前边，大声说：“我是北京红卫兵，不是我要照相，是几位双目失明的同志急着要照相啊！”老陈抬头一看，果然，不远的地方，站着六个双目失明的女学生。
    摄影员连忙把她们引进场。等候照相的红卫兵也都热情地喊：“让她们先照吧，我们多等一会儿不要紧。”老陈看到红卫兵小将对自己的阶级姐妹这样热情，心里十分高兴。他一遍又一遍仔细为她们安排构图，先是让六个姑娘站作一排，以后又让三个姑娘蹲着，另外三个站在她们的后面，直等到他觉得最满意了，才准备开照。谁知这些女学生还有些不放心，一再对老陈说：“我们从青岛来一趟北京可不容易啊，要不是我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席亲自发动这场无产阶级文化大革命，我们肯定来不了北京。你一定要把天安门前的毛主席像给照好，让我们家里的同学也能见到毛主席。”
    老陈亲切地对她们说：“你们是毛主席请来的客人，我们一定要把你们这张相照好。现在，你们的身后就是我们伟大祖国的天安门，你们六人头上面的正中，就是我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席的像……”听到这里，几个女同学高兴得互相拥抱了起来，她们不约而同地从衣袋里拿出红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》。为了使她们完全满意，保证拍好，摄影员老陈特意连照了两张。
    临走时，六个双目失明的女学生伸出手来，紧紧握着老陈的手说：“谢谢你为我们照这张最有意义的相。在最敬爱的领袖毛主席领导下，我们的祖国处处都是亲人，处处都有党的温暖。在这里，你们摄影员就是我们的亲人。”她们又一再打听摄影员的名字，老陈笑笑说：“我们也是来自五湖四海。我们是毛主席的接待员。”
