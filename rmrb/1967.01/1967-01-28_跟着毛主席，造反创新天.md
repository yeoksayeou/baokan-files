The bugle sounds, the war drums beat, and an unprecedented power seizure battle has begun!

At this critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our great leader Chairman Mao personally issued the call: The People's Liberation Army must support the revolutionary rebels! This call has swiftly turned into action by the People's Liberation Army!

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Harbin has resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions, enthusiastically supporting the Harbin Red Rebel Corps, and firmly suppressing the counter-revolutionary activities of the counter-revolutionary "Honor Restoration Army." All revolutionary rebel comrades cannot help but applaud and cheer: The revolutionary actions of the People's Liberation Army are excellent!

The good news has reached us, and all the red rebel warriors stationed in Beijing are deeply moved, gazing at the blue sky over Zhongnanhai: Dear Chairman Mao! We sincerely wish you eternal life! We will never forget that in the most arduous and difficult moments of struggle, it was you who strengthened our confidence in victory, who added to our courage to fight to the last drop of blood; in the most complex times of struggle, it was you who cleared away the fog before our eyes and pointed out the direction forward; ...

Currently, the rebel warriors of the revolutionary rebels, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and with the strongest support of the People's Liberation Army, have formed an irresistible revolutionary torrent, launching a general offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line, and successfully carrying out the struggle for proletarian seizure of power.

Dear Chairman Mao, please rest assured a thousand times, we red rebels, your loyal Red Guards, will bravely face any hardship to fulfill our pledge, rebel to create a new heaven and earth! We will not rest until we achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

We vow to defend with our lives the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

We vow to defend with our lives the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!

　　跟着毛主席，造反创新天
　　哈军工红色造反团驻京全体战士
    军号响，战鼓鸣，一场空前的夺权战开始了！
    在无产阶级文化大革命这个关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发出号召：解放军要支持革命造反派！迅速变成解放军的行动！
    解放军驻哈尔滨某部，坚决听毛主席的话，满腔热情地支持哈尔滨红色造反团，坚决镇压反革命“荣复军”的反革命活动。一切革命造反派的同志，无不拍手称快，齐声欢呼：解放军的革命行动好得很！
    喜讯传来，我驻京全体红色造反战士个个激动不已，眺望着中南海的蓝天：敬爱的毛主席啊！我们衷心地祝福您老人家万寿无疆！我们永远不会忘记在那斗争极其艰苦的严重时刻，是您坚定了我们必胜的信心，是您增添了我们浴血奋战的勇气；在那斗争极其复杂的时候，是您为我们扫尽了眼前迷雾，指出前进的方向；……
    当前，革命造反派的造反战士，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在解放军最强有力的支持下，已汇成一支不可抗拒的革命洪流，向资产阶级反动路线发起了总攻击，胜利地开展了无产阶级夺权斗争。
    敬爱的毛主席，请您一千个放心吧，我们红色造反者，您忠实的红卫兵，赴汤蹈火立壮志，革命造反创新天！不取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，誓不罢休！
    誓死捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线！
    誓死捍卫战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
