At present, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a counter-revolutionary revisionist current has emerged, namely, economism.

A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and a few die-hard defenders of the bourgeois reactionary line, have suddenly started to "care" about the workers' labor protection conditions and living welfare. They talk about promotions, subsidies, housing, and so on. They engage in material incentives to corrupt the revolutionary spirit of the masses. They squander national property and disrupt national financial management. They incite some of the masses to create disturbances over economic benefits, disrupt production, undermine proletarian dictatorship, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

All class struggles are political struggles. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must firmly grasp the line of struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. If we deviate from this line, we will lose our direction and fall into the trap of opportunism. Class interests can only be satisfied through political revolution, and the fundamental economic interests of the proletariat can only be resolved through proletarian dictatorship. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to prevent the restoration of capitalism, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and ensure that our country advances along the socialist and communist path. Only by carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end can the fundamental interests of the workers be guaranteed. If the Cultural Revolution is diverted onto the evil path of economism and is half-heartedly abandoned, then proletarian dictatorship will turn into bourgeois dictatorship, socialism will degenerate into capitalism, and we workers will fall back into the abyss of the old society, suffering exploitation and oppression. Who will then talk about labor protection conditions and living welfare? Chairman Mao teaches us: "We should educate the trade union cadres and the workers to understand that they must not be satisfied with immediate and partial benefits and forget the long-term interests of the working class." We must always bear this teaching in mind.

Revolutionary rebel workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought must resolutely expose the enemies' plots, smash their tricks, repel the attack of sugar-coated cannonballs, and firmly follow Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." We must strive for new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in industrial and mining enterprises.

    粉碎糖衣炮弹的进攻

    当前，在无产阶级文化大革命中，出现了一股反革命修正主义的逆流，即经济主义。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，一反常态，忽然“关心”起工人群众的劳保条件、生活福利来了，什么升级呀，补助呀，住房呀，等等。他们大搞物质刺激，腐蚀革命群众的斗志。他们肆意挥霍国家财产，破坏国家财政金融。他们煽动一部分群众为经济福利闹事，破坏生产，破坏无产阶级专政，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
    一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们必须牢牢掌握住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这个纲。如果我们离开了这个纲，就会迷失方向，就会走上机会主义的道路。阶级利益只能通过政治革命来满足，无产阶级的根本经济利益只能通过无产阶级专政来解决。无产阶级文化大革命就是为了防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，保证我们国家沿着社会主义、共产主义道路前进。只有把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，工人群众的根本利益才能得到保证。如果把文化大革命引向经济主义的邪路，使文化大革命半途而废，那末无产阶级专政就会变成资产阶级专政，社会主义就会蜕化为资本主义，我们工人群众就会重新回到旧社会的深渊中，受剥削和压迫，那里还能谈什么劳保条件、生活福利呢？毛主席教导我们：“应当向工会同志和工人群众进行教育，使他们懂得，决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益。”我们一定要牢记这个教导。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派工人同志们，坚决戳穿阶级敌人的阴谋，粉碎他们的诡计，击退糖衣炮弹的进攻，坚决按照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，夺取工矿企业的无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
