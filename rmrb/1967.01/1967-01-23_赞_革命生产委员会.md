In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the bourgeois reactionary line. This is a decisive struggle for the future and destiny of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is also a decisive struggle for the future and destiny of the entire Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The recent events at the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory are a microcosm of this great struggle.

In history, political gamblers, when they are cornered, often resort to desperate measures. When their economic attacks fail, they turn to political offensives; when their political attacks fail, they pick up the tattered weapons of economism again. They use these tactics in succession to create chaos and profit from it, to reap a big harvest. A small clique of capitalists within the Party who are in power at the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory are extremely hostile to the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and are frantically counterattacking. When one scheme fails, they come up with another. These people incited a large number of workers and lower-level cadres who joined the Workers' Militia to leave their production posts, hid production tools and production drawings, and tried to bring production to a standstill in the entire factory.

Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." Chairman Mao also said: "Struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory—that is the logic of the people. They will never deviate from this logic either."

Like all political gamblers, history has doomed this small clique of capitalists within the Party who are in power to defeat and to be defeated more miserably, until they are destroyed; while the revolutionary people will be victorious and advance in the midst of victory, becoming stronger and stronger, until the final victory.

The revolutionary rebel faction and the broad revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory, with unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm, responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." "Revolutionary work, if others don't do it, we will do it! The burden of production, if others don't bear it, we will bear it!" What a magnificent declaration! They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the old and established the new, and swept all before them, delivering a fatal blow to the capitalists within the Party who are in power! The drawings were hidden, so search! The tools were locked up, so smash them! The deceived members of the Workers' Militia left their production posts, so we organized the masses to do the work! The lower-level cadres ran away, so we stepped forward bravely to shoulder the heavy responsibility of "grasping revolution, promoting production"! The Party committee is rotten, so we make it step aside, we liberate ourselves, and we manage ourselves! The revolutionary masses are full of vigor and enthusiasm, and thus, a great and everlasting new thing—the "Revolutionary Production Committee"—was born!

History thus took another extremely important step forward! Mao Zedong Thought has achieved another great victory! The "Revolutionary Production Committee" has opened a new chapter in the revolutionization of industrial and mining enterprises in our country and will have an extremely profound impact on the ideological revolutionization of the industrial workers in China and the world. It is an extremely effective strategic measure to prevent and combat revisionism.

The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power. This is a fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Who will take power? Chairman Mao said: "Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords who sit on the heads of the people." Despite repeated instructions from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, some of these lords remained deaf and unmoved, dozing in their offices, allowing bourgeois ideology to gradually corrupt their souls and one by one corrupt socialist enterprises. "Drag them out, bring in new ones," and thus they changed, they themselves became agents of the bourgeoisie, and socialist enterprises became revisionist enterprises. In a word, they had completely degenerated into objects of the revolution! Unless you remove them, you can neither "grasp revolution" nor "promote production"!

The "Revolutionary Production Committee" has emerged! It calls on all proletarian revolutionary rebels in industrial and mining enterprises that have long been controlled by the bourgeoisie and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie to seize power from the capitalists within the Party who are in power! Take decisive revolutionary actions immediately! What "compromise," what "reformism," what "wait and see," all step aside! Our enterprises are great schools of Mao Zedong Thought and cannot tolerate the slightest bit of revisionist flavor! The relationships among us proletarians are entirely new and cannot tolerate the slightest bit of the old!

For thousands of years, the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes has long dominated people's minds. Even today, some people still have deeply rooted ideas of being officials and lords, and a strong interest in being officials and lords. In the seventeen years since liberation, the capitalists within the Party who are in power have treated the masses as "idiots" and seen themselves as "Zhuge Liang," "lords," and "gods," implementing "officials' rule" and "policy of fooling the people." This has made some industrial and mining enterprises formally "state-owned" and "socialist," but in essence, they are thoroughly capitalist. The volcano finally erupted! The "Revolutionary Production Committee" appeared with a new face: its members are firmly at their production posts, working with the masses. They are ordinary laborers with oil on their faces and oil on their bodies. Bourgeois aristocratic lords, do you think you can scheme against us, these stalwart men? Dream on!

"Only the people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." Chairman Mao has made this extremely profound statement: "The people have limitless creative power." What miracle created by the Chinese people under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought can stand the test of history? What deed does not have an explosive impact on the world? The three great red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, and the tumultuous Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as well as the Red Guards born in this movement, which one is not a earth-shaking event?

Today, the "Revolutionary Production Committee" has also joined this ranks! It is a committee for "grasping revolution and promoting production," a political committee organized by the masses, a production committee, a workers' committee; it is a committee formed under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, a committee of the wisdom of the masses; it is a committee produced by the universal election system of the Paris Commune; it is a committee that thoroughly breaks the old and prevents revisionism.

Forty years ago, Lenin loudly proclaimed and enthusiastically sang the praises of the "Saturday Volunteer Labor Day," a bud of communism. Today, when the "Revolutionary Production Committee," a communist organizational form that shines with the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, appears on the eastern horizon, we cannot help but shout with all our hearts and blow the trumpet to clear the way! Because the "Revolutionary Production Committee" represents the direction of the revolutionization of industrial and mining enterprises in our country!

The "Revolutionary Production Committee" is an extremely great innovation.

It stands proudly on the banks of the surging Huangpu River, proclaiming to the people of the world: Long live the Revolutionary Production Committee!

　　赞“革命生产委员会”
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线进行着生死大搏斗。这是一场决定无产阶级文化大革命的前途和命运的大搏斗，也是决定整个中国革命和世界革命的前途和命运的大搏斗。上海玻璃机械厂最近发生的事就是这场大搏斗的一个缩影。
    历史上的政治赌棍，当他们处于穷途末路的时候，都惯于作孤注一掷。经济上的进攻失败了，转用政治攻势；政治上惨败了，又拣起经济主义的破烂武器，……轮番使用，以便大乱天下，从中渔利，大捞一把。上海玻璃机械厂一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，极端仇视伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，疯狂地进行反扑。一计未成，又生一计。这些家伙唆使一大批参加工人赤卫队的中下层干部和工人脱离生产岗位，把生产工具和生产图纸藏起来，企图使全厂生产停顿。
    毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”毛主席又说：
  “斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    和一切政治赌棍一样，历史注定了这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派且战且败，愈败愈惨，直至灭亡；而革命人民则是且战且胜，在凯歌声中进攻，愈战愈强，直到最后胜利。
    上海玻璃机械厂的工人造反队和广大革命工人以无比高涨的革命热情，响应了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。“革命的事情，别人不干，我们干！生产的担子，别人不挑，我们挑！”这是多么豪壮的语言！他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大破大立，所向披靡，给党内走资本主义道路的当权派以致命的回击！图纸藏起来了，搜！工具锁起来了，砸！受蒙蔽的赤卫队员离开了生产岗位，我们就把群众组织起来干！中下层干部溜了，我们自己挺身而出，勇敢地挑起“抓革命，促生产”的重担！党委烂了，就叫它靠边站，我们自己解放自己，自己管理自己！革命群众意气风发、情绪激昂，于是，一个伟大的、具有无限生命力的新生事物——“革命生产委员会”诞生了！
    历史就这样，又向前迈进了极其重要的一步！毛泽东思想又取得了一个伟大的胜利！“革命生产委员会”揭开了我国工矿企业革命化的崭新一页，将给中国和世界的产业工人队伍的思想革命化产生极其深远的影响，是反修防修的一个极其有效的战略措施。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。这是一条马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的根本原理。什么人去掌权呢？毛主席说：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”尽管毛主席和党中央一再教导，但一些老爷们仍然充耳不闻，无动于衷，坐在办公室里打瞌睡，听凭资产阶级思想一点一点腐蚀自己的灵魂，一个一个地腐蚀社会主义的企业。“拉出去，打进来”，于是他们变了，他们自己变成了资产阶级代理人，社会主义的企业变成了修正主义的企业。一句话，他们已经完全堕落为革命的对象！不搬掉他们，你就休想“抓革命”，也休想“促生产”！
      “革命生产委员会”出世了！它向一切被资产阶级长期统治，资产阶级反动路线顽固控制的工矿企业发出了号召：无产阶级革命造反派联合起来，向走资本主义道路的当权派夺权！立即采取果断的革命行动！什么“折衷主义”、什么“改良主义”，什么“等一等、看一看”，统统靠边站！我们的企业是毛泽东思想的大学校，容不得半点修味儿！我们无产阶级人与人之间的关系是崭新的，容不得半点四旧！
    几千年来，剥削阶级的思想意识长期地统治着人们的头脑，至今还有一些人，头脑里做官当老爷的根子极深，做官当老爷的兴趣太浓。解放十七年来，党内走资本主义道路的当权派把群众当成“阿斗”，把自己看成“诸葛亮”、“老爷”、“太岁”，实行“干部训政”，实行“愚民政策”。这就使得一些工矿企业成为形式上的“国营”，“社会主义”，而实质上是道道地地的资本主义。火山终于爆发了！“革命生产委员会”以崭新的面貌出现了：它的成员坚守生产岗位，和群众在一道，他们是满脸油渍，满身油香的普通劳动者。资产阶级贵族老爷们，你们想从我们这些响当当的硬汉身上打主意吗？作梦！
      “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”毛主席这样极为精辟地论述过：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下的中国人民创造的奇迹，哪一件经不起历史的考验？哪一桩不在世界上发生爆炸性的影响？总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面伟大红旗，还有轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，以及在这个运动中诞生的红卫兵，哪一桩不是惊天动地的事情？
    今天，“革命生产委员会”也站到这个行列里来了！它是“抓革命，促生产”的委员会，它是群众自觉组织的政治委员会，生产委员会，工人委员会；它是毛泽东思想照耀下，群众智慧凝结起来的委员会；它是巴黎公社全面选举制产生出来的委员会；它是一个大破四旧、彻底反修的委员会。
    列宁在四十多年前曾为“星期六义务劳动日”这一共产主义萌芽大声呐喊，纵情讴歌。今天，当“革命生产委员会”这个闪耀着毛泽东思想无限光芒的共产主义组织形式的萌芽在东方地平线上崭露头角的时候，我们情不自禁地要用满腔热情为之大喊大叫，鸣锣开道！因为“革命生产委员会”所代表的，乃是我国工矿企业革命化的方向！
      “革命生产委员会”是一个极其伟大的创举。
    它已经巍然屹立在滔滔的黄浦江边向全世界人民宣告：革命生产委员会万岁！
