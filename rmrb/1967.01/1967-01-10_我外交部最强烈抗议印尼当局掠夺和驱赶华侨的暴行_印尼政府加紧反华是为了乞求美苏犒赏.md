The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China on January 9th sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China, expressing the strongest protest against the Indonesian government's recent implementation of the 1959 "Presidential Decree No. 10" nationwide to plunder the property of overseas Chinese, cut off their livelihoods, and force them to leave their original residences. The note warned the Indonesian government to immediately stop all forms of persecution against overseas Chinese; otherwise, the Indonesian government must bear all the consequences that follow.

The note stated, "Over the past year, the Indonesian government has disregarded internationally recognized principles of international relations and ignored the condemnation of world public opinion, relentlessly pursuing anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, and wantonly persecuting overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia. The Indonesian government has repeatedly dispatched military and police forces, organized mobs to attack and loot Chinese shops and residences, destroy and seize Chinese schools and organizations, beat, arrest, and massacre innocent overseas Chinese, and even drive large numbers of overseas Chinese out of their original residences, forcibly concentrating them in so-called 'detention centers,' creating a series of unprecedented atrocities in international history. At the same time, the persecution has intensified, and the Indonesian government has recently announced the reimplementation and expansion of the 1959 'Presidential Decree No. 10,' aiming to plunder the property of overseas Chinese nationwide, cut off their livelihoods, and force them to leave their original residences, with the goal of systematically and organizedly driving large numbers of overseas Chinese out of the country. This decree has been actively implemented in some regions and is expanding to various parts of Indonesia. Now, the lives and property of countless overseas Chinese are completely unprotected, and they live in a state of terror. The Chinese government strongly protests against the Indonesian government's intensified persecution and expulsion of overseas Chinese."

The note further stated, "The Indonesian government's wanton persecution of overseas Chinese is nothing more than an attempt to play the role of an anti-China lackey in the current situation where U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism are further colluding against China, in exchange for rewards from the U.S. and the Soviet Union. You claim that the persecution of overseas Chinese is to protect Indonesia's national interests and accuse overseas Chinese of monopolizing and controlling Indonesia's economy. This is a complete distortion of facts and a reversal of right and wrong. Everyone knows that it is not others but imperialism and neo-colonialism that monopolize and control Indonesia's economy. The Indonesian government, on the one hand, ruthlessly persecutes the broad masses of overseas Chinese who play an active role in developing Indonesia's national economy, and on the other hand, through measures such as the so-called 'Foreign Investment Law,' opens the door wide for imperialist monopolies to plunder the Indonesian people, even announcing the return of enterprises seized and nationalized by imperialist monopolies during the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial struggle. What you are doing is clearly selling out Indonesia's national interests, not protecting them. The Indonesian people and people around the world see this clearly and cannot be covered up by any excuses."

The note concluded, "The Chinese government once again warns the Indonesian government: your trampling of international relations principles, violation of Indonesia's national interests, and large-scale expulsion and persecution of overseas Chinese will only begin by harming others and end by harming yourselves. The Chinese government reiterates the various reasonable demands proposed in previous notes. You must immediately stop all forms of persecution against overseas Chinese; otherwise, all the consequences that follow must be borne by you."

    我外交部最强烈抗议印尼当局掠夺和驱赶华侨的暴行
    印尼政府加紧反华是为了乞求美苏犒赏
    新华社九日讯　中国外交部九日照会印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，最强烈地抗议印尼政府最近正积极推行在全国范围内掠夺华侨的财产，断绝华侨的生计，强迫华侨离开原住地的一九五九年“总统第十号条例”，加紧迫害和驱赶华侨的暴行。照会正告印尼政府必须立即停止对华侨的一切迫害，否则印尼政府必须承担由此引起的一切后果。
    照会说，“这一年多以来，印度尼西亚政府蔑视公认的国际关系准则，不顾世界公正舆论的谴责，竭力推行反华排华政策，恣意迫害居住在印尼的华侨。印尼政府不断出动军警，组织暴徒，袭击和抢掠华侨的商店、住宅，捣毁和霸占华侨的学校、团体，殴打、逮捕和屠杀无辜华侨，甚至把大批华侨赶出原住地，强行集中在所谓‘收容所’里，制造了一系列国际上罕见的暴行。在这种迫害愈演愈烈的同时，最近，印尼政府又宣布重新实施和扩大一九五九年‘总统第十号条例’，要在全国范围内掠夺华侨的财产，断绝华侨的生计，强逼华侨离开原住地，目的是要有步骤和有组织地把大批华侨驱赶出境。这一条例已经在一些地区积极推行，而且正在向印尼各个地区扩展。现在无数华侨的生命和财产的安全已经毫无保障，他们完全生活在恐怖的气氛之中。中国政府对印尼政府这种加紧迫害和驱赶华侨的暴行，提出最强烈的抗议。”
    照会说：“印尼政府这样猖狂地迫害华侨，无非是要在当前美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义进一步勾结反华的时候，积极扮演一个反华走卒的角色，以换取美苏的犒赏。你们为了掩盖这一事实，说什么迫害华侨是为了维护印尼的民族利益，诬蔑华侨垄断和控制了印尼的经济。这完全是混淆黑白，颠倒是非。谁都知道，垄断和控制印尼经济的不是别人，正是帝国主义和新老殖民主义。印尼政府一方面残酷迫害在发展印尼民族经济的事业中起着积极作用的广大华侨，一方面却通过制订所谓‘外国投资法令’等措施，为帝国主义垄断资本掠夺印尼人民大开方便之门，甚至宣布退还印尼人民在反帝、反殖斗争中接管和没收的帝国主义垄断资本的企业。你们这样做，究竟是维护印尼的民族利益，还是出卖印尼的民族利益？印尼人民和全世界人民都是看得清清楚楚的，是任何借口也掩饰不了的。”
    照会最后说：“中国政府再一次正告印尼政府：你们践踏国际关系准则，违背印尼民族利益，大规模驱赶和迫害华侨，只能是以损人开始，以害己告终。中国政府重申在历次照会中所提出的各项正当合理的要求。你们必须立即停止对华侨的一切迫害，否则由此而引起的一切后果必须由你们承担。”
