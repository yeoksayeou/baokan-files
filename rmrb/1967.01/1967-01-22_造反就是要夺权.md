Revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified! Rebel to the end, that is victory!

What does it mean to rebel to the end? To rebel to the end is to seize all power back into the hands of the revolutionary proletariat. Rebellion is the struggle for power.

The great teachers of the proletarian revolution, Marx and Engels, solemnly declared to the world in the earth-shaking "Communist Manifesto": "The proletariat's aim can be achieved only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution."

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental question of revolution is to seize power and consolidate it.

Not to rebel against the bourgeoisie is one hundred percent revisionism, to rebel without seizing power is also one hundred percent revisionism.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and those who pushed the bourgeois reactionary line, upon seeing the revolutionary masses rising up to rebel against them, were afraid of losing their power. They, out of the instinctive sensitivity of the reactionary class, shouted: "They are seizing power!" Exactly, we are seizing power! We are fearless revolutionaries, we must seize back all the power that has been usurped by those reactionaries!

There is a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who control some of the Party, government, and financial powers. They conspire to usurp the Party, the government, and the military. In the field of literature and art, anti-Party and anti-socialist elements almost control all literary and art organizations and troupes. In educational and cultural units, capitalist-roaders in power gather a group of bourgeois intellectuals to control schools and cultural organizations. In industrial and mining enterprises, capitalist-roaders in power operate capitalistically, attempting to drag our enterprises onto the capitalist and revisionist road.

These counter-revolutionary revisionists, anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, and capitalist-roaders in power are striving to restore capitalism. They collude with a group of bourgeois elements whose worldview has not been transformed, conspire with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and impose bourgeois dictatorship and white terror on the revolutionary faction, making the places they control chaotic. Is this not just as Chairman Mao warned, "Without much time, in a few years or a decade, or at most a few decades, a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration is inevitable"?

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power and stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line still use their Party power, government power, and financial power to deceive the masses, suppress the revolutionary faction, and engage in counter-revolutionary economism to achieve their evil goal of sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Ask yourself, if we do not seize back the power from these people, will we not ruin the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and let their plots succeed?

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has produced a large number of fearless revolutionaries who are not afraid of heaven, earth, gods, or ghosts. This group of revolutionary pioneers, closely following our great leader Chairman Mao, have been tempered through storms and waves. The ranks of the revolutionary left have grown larger and stronger. Revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are uniting, merging into a surging torrent. After half a year of public opinion preparation, the revolutionary rebels have thoroughly refuted the counter-revolutionary revisionist nonsense of "revolution is a crime, rebellion is unjustified." They have smashed the "preservation" and established the "revolution," gradually uniting under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. "So many things, all urgent; the world turns, time presses. A thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment." It is time to seize power, if not now, when?

"Just remove those capitalist-roaders in power, won't that do? Why must we seize power?" This is the logic of fools. Such people do not understand what revolution is, what mass movement is. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a thorough revolution to uproot revisionism and eliminate the breeding ground for capitalist restoration. If we do not mobilize hundreds of millions of people, if we do not wage a people's war that is spectacular and resounding, if we do not launch a bottom-up power seizure, how can we thoroughly defeat the capitalist-roaders in power and the stubborn elements who cling to the bourgeois reactionary line? How can we expose their backers? At the same time, without a bottom-up power seizure, how can we train a group of steadfast revolutionary rebels, enabling them to possess the dual abilities of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism? Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that revolution cannot be achieved through others' benevolence; it must be achieved through the masses liberating themselves. Power must be seized by the revolutionary rebels themselves.

"The word 'seize power' is too harsh." Yes, revolution is a violent action; where is the gentle, respectful, courteous, and thrifty revolution? Otherwise, it is reformism. Seizing power is the intensification of class struggle; it is our revolutionary goal. The power held by counter-revolutionary revisionists and a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party was originally usurped from the proletariat. Some we have not seized, or not completely seized. They will not easily hand over their power. Seizing power means to fight them down, fight them to the ground, fight them to stink, and thoroughly eliminate their influence. Seizing power is a fierce struggle, ultimately to tightly grasp all power in the hands of the revolutionary faction. The word "seize power" sounds harsh to those bourgeois gentlemen, but it clearly explains the essence of the matter.

"All power to the revolutionary rebels, scaring away the middle-of-the-road masses, not strategic." Another group of "strategists" jumps out shouting. All power to the revolutionary rebels means all power to the revolutionary masses with the leftists as the core. The revolutionary rebels who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought will ultimately unite more than ninety-five percent of the masses. The revolutionary rebels unite the middle-of-the-road masses, win over the deceived masses through struggle, not through compromise or reconciliation. The middle forces and conservative forces are mostly used by the capitalist-roaders in power. As long as they remain in the middle and conservative state, we must not talk about equal power, otherwise we cannot truly seize power and truly grasp power in the hands of the revolutionary faction. The strategy of the proletariat is based on the greatest interests of the majority, and we must not sacrifice principles for compromise.

"You can't lead after seizing power." Comrade, you are too lacking in spirit. Do you believe in the masses? Do you believe in the Party? Revolutionary masses have limitless creativity. Mao Zedong Thought has limitless power. Revolutionary rebels who master Mao Zedong Thought, kicking out the capitalist-roaders in power, breaking the old capitalist and revisionist frameworks, will only do the work better. Have you not seen that the working class in Shanghai has tightly grasped the destiny of the proletarian revolution and the destiny of the socialist economy? "Grasp revolution, promote production" is done so well! Have you not seen that the revolutionary rebels of the Shanghai "Wenhui Daily" and "Liberation Daily" have produced such excellent newspapers once they seized power? Put away that argument of doing nothing!

"The path of humanity is tumultuous." The working class of Shanghai has set a brilliant example of seizing power. Now the revolutionary situation is excellent! The call to seize power has resounded throughout the country.

Proletarian revolutionaries, unite! Resolutely seize power from a handful of capitalist-roaders!

Achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

　　造反就是要夺权
　　北京地质学院《东方红》通讯社
    革命无罪，造反有理！造反到底，就是胜利！
    什么是造反到底？造反到底就是要把一切权力夺回到无产阶级革命派的手中。造反就是夺权斗争。
    伟大的无产阶级革命的导师马克思、恩格斯在震撼世界的《共产党宣言》里向全世界庄严地宣布：无产阶级“他们的目的只有用暴力推翻全部现存的社会制度才能达到。让统治阶级在共产主义革命面前发抖吧。”
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是夺取政权和巩固政权。
    不造资产阶级的反是百分之百的修正主义，造反不夺权也是百分之百的修正主义。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和那些推行资产阶级反动路线的人，对于刚刚要起来造他们反的革命群众，就害怕自己的权势被夺走。他们出自反动阶级本能的敏感叫嚷：“要夺权啦！”对了，我们就是要夺权！我们是大无畏的革命造反者，我们就是要把被那些反动家伙篡夺去的一切权力统统夺回来！
    有那么一小撮反革命修正主义分子，把持着一些党、政、财等领导权，他们阴谋篡党、篡政、篡军。在文化艺术领域里，反党反社会主义分子几乎统治了全部的文艺机关和文艺团体。在文教单位里，走资本主义道路的当权派纠集着一批资产阶级知识分子统治着学校和文化机关。在工矿企业里，走资本主义道路的当权派搞资本主义的经营，妄图把我们的企业拉向资本主义、修正主义的道路。
    这些反革命修正主义分子，反党反社会主义分子和走资本主义道路的当权派，竭力要搞资本主义复辟，他们伙同一批世界观没有得到改造的资产阶级分子，勾结地、富、反、坏、右分子，对革命派实行资产阶级专政，实行白色恐怖，把他们所控制的地方搞得乌烟瘴气。这种情景，难道不正如毛主席所告诫的那样，“不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟”吗？
    在无产阶级文化大革命当中，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子还利用他们掌握的党权、政权、财权，欺骗群众，打击革命派，大搞反革命经济主义，以达到他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的。试问，不夺回这些家伙手中的权，岂不是要断送无产阶级文化大革命，让这些家伙的阴谋得逞吗？
    无产阶级文化大革命，造就了一大批天不怕、地不怕、神不怕、鬼不怕的革命造反者。这批革命闯将，紧紧跟着我们伟大领袖毛主席，风里浪里来锻炼，围攻迫害不动摇。革命左派的队伍越来越大，越战越强。革命的工人、革命的学生、革命的干部和革命的知识分子正在联合起来，汇合成滚滚的洪流。革命造反派经过艰苦的斗争，经过半年的舆论准备，彻底地批倒了“革命有罪、造反无理”的反革命修正主义的混帐谬论。大破“保”字，大立“革”字，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下逐渐联合起来了。“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”权是到了非夺不可的时候了，此时不夺，更待何时？
      “把那些走资本主义道路的当权派撤换下来，不就成了吗？为什么非要去夺权？”这是糊涂虫的逻辑。这种人不懂得什么是革命，什么是群众运动。无产阶级文化大革命是一个彻底挖掉修正主义根子、铲除资本主义复辟温床的大革命。如果不发动起亿万群众，不打他个轰轰烈烈的“人民战争”，不来一个自下而上的大夺权，怎么能彻底打垮走资本主义道路的当权派和死抱资产阶级反动路线僵尸的顽固分子？他们的幕后保护人又怎么能给揪出来呢？同时，不来一个自下而上的大夺权，又怎么能锻炼出一批坚定的革命造反派，使他们具有反修和防修的双重本领？毛主席一再教导我们，革命不能是靠别人恩赐的，要靠群众自己解放自己。权就要靠革命造反派自己来夺。
    “夺权的字眼太刺耳了。”是的，革命就是暴烈的行动，哪里有温良恭俭让的革命？否则，就是改良主义。夺权是阶级斗争的激化，是我们革命的目的。反革命修正主义分子和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所掌的权，本来是从无产阶级手中篡过去的。有的我们一直没有夺过来，或者没有完全夺过来。他们是不会轻易地交出权的。夺权，就是要把他们斗倒，斗垮，斗臭，彻底地肃清他们的影响。夺权，就是一场激烈的斗争，最后要把一切权力紧紧地掌握在革命派的手中。“夺权”这个字眼，在那些资产阶级老爷们听起来很刺耳，但它最明确不过地说明了事情的本质。
    “一切权力归革命造反派，把中间群众吓跑了，不策略。”又一批“策略家”跳出来大叫大嚷。一切权力归革命造反派，就是一切权力归以左派为核心的革命群众。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的革命造反派，最终是要团结百分之九十五以上的群众的。革命造反派团结中间群众，争取受蒙蔽的群众，是要通过斗争来达到的，不能搞折衷，不能搞调和。中间势力和保守势力，他们大都是被走资本主义道路当权派所利用的。当他们还处于中间和保守的状态，决不能讲平均权力，否则就不能真正把权夺过来，不能真正把权紧紧地掌握在革命派的手中。无产阶级的策略，是从最大多数人的最大利益出发的，绝不能牺牲原则讲妥协。
      “夺了权，我们领导不了。”同志，你也未免太没有出息了。你相信群众吗？你相信党吗？革命群众有无限的创造力。毛泽东思想有无限的威力。掌握了毛泽东思想的革命造反派，踢开了走资本主义道路的当权派，破除了资本主义、修正主义的老框框，只会把工作做得越好。君不见上海的工人阶级已紧紧掌握了无产阶级革命的命运，紧紧掌握了社会主义经济的命运，“抓革命，促生产”是做得何等好啊！君不见上海《文汇报》和《解放日报》革命造反派，一旦夺了权，报纸又是办得何等的出色！收起那套无所作为的论点吧！
    “人间正道是沧桑。”上海工人阶级给我们树立了夺权的光辉榜样。如今革命形势大好！夺权的冲锋号已经响彻祖国四面八方。
    无产阶级革命派，团结起来，坚决向一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权！
    夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利！
