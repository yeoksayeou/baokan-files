The east wind is strong and the red flag flies high. The situation for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent. The revolutionary rebels have united and are fighting side by side at the forefront. The enemy, cornered and desperate, is playing new tricks, stirring up a black wind of economism, attempting to shift the target of the struggle. Pfft, how can a stubborn stone block the surging torrent? How ridiculous for an ant to shake a tree. Thick fog cannot blind our clear eyes. We will sweep away all the garbage with an iron broom. The revolutionary rebels are loyal to the Party, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings firmly. Seize the revolution, promote production, shoulders of iron dare to bear the heavy burden. On the revolutionary path, we are the vanguard, on the production front, we are heroes. We will resolutely repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and the song of victory will echo through the skies!

　　铁肩敢把重担挑
　　红宇东风劲吹红旗飘，无产阶级文化大革命的形势大好。革命造反派联合起来，并肩战斗在最前哨。负隅顽抗的敌人吓破了胆狗急跳墙玩弄新花招，刮起了一股经济主义的黑风，妄图转移斗争的目标。呸，顽石哪能挡住滔滔巨流，蚍蜉撼树太可笑。浓雾迷不了咱们明亮的双眼，用铁扫帚把一切垃圾除掉。革命造反派心向党，毛主席的教导记得牢，抓革命，促生产，铁肩敢把重担挑。革命路上打先锋，生产战线逞英豪，坚决打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，胜利的歌声响彻云霄！
