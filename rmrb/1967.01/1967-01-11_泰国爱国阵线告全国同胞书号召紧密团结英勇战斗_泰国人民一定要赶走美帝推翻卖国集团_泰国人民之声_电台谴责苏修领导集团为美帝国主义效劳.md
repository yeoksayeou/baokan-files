The Patriotic Front of Thailand issued a New Year's message to all compatriots, calling on the Thai people to unite more closely and fight to drive out American imperialism, overthrow the Sarit-Thanom traitorous clique, and save the country's independence!

The message said that in the past two years since its establishment, the Patriotic Front of Thailand has carried out various struggles, mainly armed struggle, which have seriously struck the U.S.-Thai reactionaries, making them panic-stricken and restless. At present, the flames of armed struggle in the northeastern and southern regions are spreading like wildfire; workers, peasants, urban poor, and lower-level government employees from all walks of life are staging strikes, protests, and petitions in various places.

The message said that through the struggle, the Thai people have gradually come to realize that the Patriotic Front of Thailand is the true defender of the interests of the Thai people. Therefore, in just two years, the anti-American, pro-national salvation struggle led by the Patriotic Front of Thailand has rapidly grown. Many patriotic individuals, groups, and organizations have joined the ranks of the Patriotic Front of Thailand.

The message denounced the Sarit-Thanom traitorous clique for blindly following American imperialism, placing Thailand's politics, military, economy, and culture completely under the control of American imperialism. The message emphasized that the heinous crimes of the Sarit-Thanom clique will one day be settled by the Thai people.

The message called on the Thai people to unite closely and organize themselves to bravely and resolutely fight against American imperialism and the Sarit-Thanom clique. The message said that as long as they dare to fight and are good at fighting, the final victory will surely belong to the Thai people.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok: "The Voice of the Thai People" radio station recently commented that in 1966, the revolutionary situation in the world developed in a direction greatly favorable to the struggle of the Thai people and the revolutionary people of the world. People of various countries have directed their struggle against American imperialism. The revolutionary storm of national liberation is sweeping through Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and armed struggle has become the main form of struggle for the people of these regions.

The commentary enthusiastically praised the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys, and condemned American imperialism for playing the "war and peace" game. It also condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for serving the U.S. "peace" fraud.

The commentary called on the Thai people to unite closely and, on the basis of the victories achieved in 1966, carry the people's armed struggle to the end. It called for driving out American imperialism from Thailand, overthrowing the Sarit-Thanom traitorous clique, and fighting for the independence, democracy, peace, neutrality, and prosperity of Thailand.

    告同胞书说，泰国爱国阵线成立两年来，开展以武装斗争为主要形式的各种斗争，严重地打击了美泰反动派，使他们惊惶失措，坐卧不安。目前，在东北部和南部地区点燃起来的武装斗争烈火正在发展成燎原之势；工人、农民、城市贫民和下级公务人员等各阶层人民的罢工、抗议、请愿等各种形式的斗争也在各地此起彼伏。
    告同胞书说，泰国人民在斗争中逐渐认识到，泰国爱国阵线是泰国人民利益的真正维护者，所以，在短短两年内，在泰国爱国阵线领导下的抗美救国斗争队伍迅速壮大。许多爱国人士、团体和组织纷纷参加了泰国爱国阵线的行列。

    据新华社讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台在最近发表评论说，一九六六年，世界革命形势朝着大大有利于泰国人民和世界革命人民斗争的方向发展，世界各国人民把斗争矛头集中指向美帝国主义。民族解放运动的革命风暴正在席卷亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲地区，而武装斗争已经成为亚非拉各国人民的主要斗争形式。
    评论热烈赞扬越南人民在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争中所取得的伟大胜利，并谴责美帝国主义玩弄战“和”两手，谴责苏修领导集团为美国“和谈”骗局效劳。
    评论号召泰国人民紧密团结起来，在一九六六年所取得的胜利的基础上，把人民武装斗争进行到底，为把美帝国主义赶出泰国，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，为实现泰国的独立、民主、和平、中立和繁荣而斗争。
