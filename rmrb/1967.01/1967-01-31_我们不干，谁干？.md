Recently, revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, Shanxi, Qingdao, and other regions have seized the leadership from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. This seizure of power is correct and well done! This is another great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao in its decisive battle against the bourgeois reactionary line!

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. We must resolutely and without hesitation seize the leadership of the proletarian dictatorship from the hands of the capitalist-roaders in power, seize the leadership of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seize the leadership of newspapers and all means of public opinion, and seize the leadership of the economic lifelines. All power to the revolutionary rebels! Only by firmly grasping the leadership in our own hands can the revolutionary rebels truly implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and only then can we shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

Those representatives of the bourgeoisie, those stubborn elements who implement the bourgeois reactionary line, think that we are young people with little experience and unknown masses who cannot handle big tasks. They think that without them, we cannot get by. We do not believe this. We revolutionary rebels are the masters of history. The people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the all-powerful in revolution.

Chairman Mao has always taught us, "Revolutionary war is the people's business. It is often not a matter of learning first and then doing, but of doing and then learning. Doing is learning."

We do not rely on heaven, nor on earth, but on Mao Zedong Thought. Great Mao Zedong Thought is our invincible weapon, the source of our revolutionary rebel strength, the source of our courage, the source of our wisdom, and the source of our victory. In a word, it is a spiritual atomic bomb. With this spiritual atomic bomb, we can not only seize the leadership from the hands of the capitalist-roaders in power but will definitely be able to hold the great power of revolution firmly in our hands.

The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will speak? If we do not act, who will act? We must, like the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, in the course of struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, greatly criticize a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, greatly seize the power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and be thoroughly critical and thoroughly seize. We firmly believe that as long as we unswervingly follow the direction indicated by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, sail along the course of Mao Zedong Thought, and advance courageously, we will definitely be able to seize the power, definitely be able to learn to hold power; definitely be able to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end; definitely be able to eliminate all harmful elements; and definitely be able to advance victoriously toward the ideal of communism.

Long live the spirit of revolutionary rebellion!

    我们不干，谁干？
　　红军文
    最近，上海、山西、青岛和其他地区的革命造反派，从一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的手中，夺回了领导权。这个权夺得对，夺得好！这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线决战中的又一伟大胜利！
    革命的根本问题就是政权问题。我们要坚决地、毫不犹豫地从走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回无产阶级专政的领导权，夺回文化大革命运动的领导权，夺回报纸和一切舆论工具的领导权，夺回经济命脉的领导权。一切权力归革命造反派！革命造反派只有把领导权牢牢地掌握在自己的手中，才能真正贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，才能挑起抓革命促生产的两副重担。
    那些资产阶级的代表人物，那些执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，认为我们是些乳臭未干、胎毛未落的青年人和不出名的群众，办不了大事，以为我们离开了他们就过不了日子。我们不信这一套。我们革命造反派，是历史的主人。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众，是革命的万能者。
    毛主席一向教导我们，“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习”。
    我们不靠天，不靠地，就是靠毛泽东思想。伟大的毛泽东思想是我们战无不胜的武器，是我们革命造反派力量的源泉，勇敢的源泉，智慧的源泉，胜利的源泉。一句话，就是精神原子弹。有了这种精神原子弹，我们就不仅能够把领导权从走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺过来，而且一定能够把革命的大权掌好。
    天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？我们要象上海的革命造反派那样，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，大造一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，大夺一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的权，要大反特反，一反到底，要大夺特夺，一夺到底。我们坚信：只要我们坚定不移地遵循伟大的舵手毛主席指引的方向，沿着毛泽东思想的航道，勇往直前，我们就一定能把权夺过来，就一定能够学会掌权；就一定能够把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；就一定能够消灭一切害人虫；就一定能够胜利地向共产主义的理想前进。
    革命造反精神万岁！
