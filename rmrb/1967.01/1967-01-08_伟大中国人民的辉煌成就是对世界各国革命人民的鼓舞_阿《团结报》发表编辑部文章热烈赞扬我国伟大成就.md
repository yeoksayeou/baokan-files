    文章说，去年，伟大的中国人民在光荣的中国共产党领导下，在毛泽东同志战无不胜的思想的指导下和无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，在社会主义建设的各个方面取得了光辉的成就。天才的中国人民时刻突出政治，依靠自力更生，大踏步向前迈进，全面地推进国民经济。中国第三个五年计划第一年——一九六六年的任务已经胜利超额完成。
    文章说，兄弟的中国人民在中国共产党的社会主义建设总路线的指导下，以高度的革命热情，进一步展开阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，并在全国掀起了工业学大庆，农业学大寨，全国学解放军的运动。中国人民像一个人一样团结在以毛泽东同志为首的党的周围，以革命的步伐向前迈进，把自己的祖国建设得更加繁荣和昌盛。中华人民共和国已经成为战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的不可摧毁的堡垒。
    文章说，中国人民在科学技术方面取得的进展具有伟大的世界意义。在去年八个月中，成功地进行了包括导弹核武器在内的三次核试验，这证明了中国在核武器方面的高度科学技术水平和中国核能力的不断发展。设计和建成世界上第一个生产合成苯的车间，这在世界化学工业史上打开了光辉的一页。具有生物活力的蛋白质——结晶胰岛素的制成，是人类在揭开生命奥秘的伟大历程中迈出的十分重要的新的一大步，这标志着人工合成蛋白质的时代的开始。中国科学工作者的这一英雄创举表明，中国的杰出科学工作者勇敢地攀登上前人所没有攀登过的现代科学的高峰。
    文章指出，大庆油田的两个先进钻井队创造的在十一个月零五天内钻井十万米的世界新纪录，以及其他许多令人惊奇的工业新产品的制造成功，证明了中国人民群众的巨大创造力和席卷全国的革命热潮。
    文章说，中国人民取得的伟大成就是中国人民及其朋友的重大胜利，是对中国人民的敌人帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的沉重打击。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民取得的光辉成就感到无限高兴。阿尔巴尼亚人民把这些成就看成是自己的成就，认为这些成就有助于加强反对帝国主义、现代修正主义、争取马克思列宁主义完全胜利的共同斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民向兄弟的中国人民衷心祝贺这些成就，并衷心祝贺兄弟的中国人民在毛泽东思想和无产阶级文化大革命的伟大旗帜下，在第三个五年计划的第二年中取得更加巨大的胜利。
