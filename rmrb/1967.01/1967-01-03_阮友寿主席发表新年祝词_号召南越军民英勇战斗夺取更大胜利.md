Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam delivered a New Year's address, calling on the military and people of South Vietnam to bravely fight and achieve greater victories in the new year.

According to a broadcast by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam on January 1, Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, delivered a New Year's address. He called on the military and people of South Vietnam to, in the new year, advance with an overwhelming momentum, continue to fight bravely, endure hardships, and make sacrifices, and resolutely defeat the American aggressors.

In his address, Nguyen Huu Tho pointed out that in the past year, the military and people of South Vietnam demonstrated the invincible power of people's war. On all battlefields and in all four seasons, they defeated the enemy, initially defeating the most ferocious imperialist aggressors' local war, and achieved many major victories on the military, political, economic, and diplomatic fronts.

Nguyen Huu Tho said: Although the American aggressors are at their wits' end, they are still very stubborn and cunning. We must defeat the American aggressors and overthrow the regime of the American imperialist puppet clique that is ruining the country. This is the iron will of all our military and people. Only in this way can we achieve independence and freedom, and have true peace.

Nguyen Huu Tho called on the military and people of the South to advance with an overwhelming momentum in the new year, fearing neither hardships nor sacrifices, and to be determined to fight on, no matter how long it takes, and resolutely achieve comprehensive and ultimate victory.

Nguyen Huu Tho also expressed warm regards to the families of martyrs, wounded and sick soldiers, and patriots imprisoned by the enemy in the South, and wished all the military and people of the South to enthusiastically participate in various competitions, achieve greater results, and win more glorious victories.
