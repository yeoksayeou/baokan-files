The revolutionary rebels of the *Wenhui Daily* have broken through layer upon layer of obstacles and finally emerged, pronouncing the death sentence on the old *Wenhui Daily*. A new *Wenhui Daily*, radiant with the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, has been born in the blazing flames of the Cultural Revolution! This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a new victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

We revolutionary rebels are overjoyed and thrilled to hear this news. We wholeheartedly welcome this new birth and resolutely support the revolutionary action of the "Spark Igniting the Prairie Fire" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters to seize power.

The old *Wenhui Daily* has committed heinous crimes against the Party and the people. The *Wenhui Daily* of 1957 was a stronghold for the rightists' frenzied attacks against the Party and socialism. During the period of national economic difficulties, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists took control of the *Wenhui Daily*, more covertly and viciously opposing the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Since June 1, 1966, the *Wenhui Daily* has faithfully carried out a bourgeois reactionary line. During the Cultural Revolution, the *Wenhui Daily* stood on the reactionary bourgeois standpoint, suppressing the masses, confusing right and wrong, black and white, besieging the revolutionaries, boosting the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, and crushing the spirit of the proletariat. The *Wenhui Daily* has become a tool for them to implement the bourgeois reactionary line and carry out bourgeois dictatorship.

Today, as Chairman Mao's revolutionary line marches from victory to greater victory, the question of where the *Wenhui Daily* is headed has become extremely serious. Continue as before? That is stubborn and a dead end. Change the appearance and make some modifications to continue deceiving the masses? That is continuing to commit crimes against the Party and the people. What should be done? Chairman Mao says: "The essence of Marxism-Leninism is summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" Yes, rebellion! Only by rebelling and thoroughly smashing the old *Wenhui Daily* can the *Wenhui Daily* be reborn and have a bright future. The revolutionary rebels of the *Wenhui Daily* have rebelled and seized power according to Chairman Mao's teachings, which is truly excellent! We welcome this with both hands.

The rebirth of the *Wenhui Daily* is the result of the broad revolutionary masses of the *Wenhui Daily* holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and working hard on the "rebellion" aspect.

The first issue of the revolutionary rebel *Wenhui Daily* has been published, marking only the beginning of victory. Revolution is not an easy task, and there are still many difficulties and obstacles ahead. But no matter how great the difficulties, they cannot deter heroes armed with Mao Zedong Thought. With the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao backing us, what difficulties can there be? As long as we grasp Mao Zedong Thought and have a heart full of loyalty to defend Chairman Mao, we can create any miracle in the world.

Chairman Mao says: "We can learn things we did not know before. We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." We are determined to stand together with the revolutionary rebels of the *Wenhui Daily*, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly standing on the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, uniting all comrades who want revolution, and isolating a small clique of diehards to the greatest extent, making the new *Wenhui Daily* even better. The new *Wenhui Daily* must always and in all things propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making it a newspaper that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The new *Wenhui Daily* must promptly and accurately reflect the new situation of the cultural revolution in the Shanghai area, making significant contributions to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We sincerely hope that the staff of the *Wenhui Daily* will study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and always stay on the front line of the struggle, deeply among the masses of workers and peasants, cultivating themselves into news warriors of the proletariat.

We revolutionary workers and Red Guards pledge to be your strong backing, doing our utmost and unconditionally supporting your revolutionary actions, helping you overcome all difficulties on the road ahead. We are confident that more than 90% of the revolutionary masses support you, and we will forever stand together with you, rebel together, fight together, and win together. Whoever dares to obstruct or sabotage the normal publication and distribution of the new *Wenhui Daily*, we will take decisive revolutionary actions.

Comrades in arms, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance bravely! The final victory will surely belong to the revolutionary rebels who are determined to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

    永远和你们战斗在一起
    《文汇报》的革命造反派冲破层层阻力，终于杀了出来，宣判了旧《文汇报》的死刑。一张闪耀着毛泽东思想万丈光芒的新《文汇报》，在文化大革命的熊熊烈火中诞生了！这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是毛主席的革命路线的新胜利！
    我们革命造反派听到这个喜讯无不欢欣鼓舞，拍手称快。我们最热烈地欢迎这个新生事物的诞生，最最坚决地支持《文汇报》“星火燎原”革命造反总部起来夺权的革命行动。
    旧《文汇报》对党对人民犯下了滔天罪行。一九五七年的《文汇报》，是右派疯狂向党向社会主义进攻的阵地。在国家经济困难时期，一小撮反革命修正主义分子又把持着《文汇报》，更隐蔽、更恶毒地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想。一九六六年六月一日以来的《文汇报》，又不折不扣地贯彻了一条资产阶级反动路线。《文汇报》在文化大革命中，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，压制群众，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，长资产阶级威风，灭无产阶级志气。《文汇报》变成了他们推行资产阶级反动路线，实行资产阶级专政的御用工具。
    在毛主席的革命路线从胜利走向更大胜利的今天，《文汇报》往何处去便成了一个极端严重的问题。按老样子办下去吗？那是顽固不化，死路一条。改头换面、修修改改，继续蒙蔽群众吗？那是继续对党对人民犯罪。怎么办？毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”对，造反！只有起来造反，彻底砸烂旧《文汇报》，才能使《文汇报》获得新生，才有光明前途。《文汇报》的革命造反派按着毛主席的教导起来造反了，起来夺权了，真是好得很，好极了！我们举双手欢迎。
    《文汇报》的新生，是《文汇报》广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，在“造反”二字上狠下功夫的结果。
    第一张革命造反的新《文汇报》出版了，这仅仅是胜利的开端。革命是件不容易的事，我们前进的道路上困难、障碍还很多。但天大的困难，吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄汉，有党中央和毛主席给我们撑腰，困难算得了什么。只要我们掌握了毛泽东思想，又有一片誓死保卫毛主席的赤胆忠心，什么人间奇迹都可以创造出来。
    毛主席说：“我们能够学会我们原来不懂的东西。我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”我们决心同《文汇报》的革命造反派一起高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线的立场上，团结一切要革命的同志，最大限度地孤立一小撮顽固分子，把新《文汇报》办得更好。新《文汇报》必须时时、事事宣传毛泽东思想，使之成为一张高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的报纸。新《文汇报》必须最迅速、最准确地反映上海地区文化革命的新形势，为保卫毛主席的革命路线做出重大贡献。我们殷切地希望《文汇报》的工作人员，学好用好毛主席著作，与工农兵相结合，永远深入斗争的第一线，深入工农群众中去，把自己培养成为无产阶级的新闻战士。
    我们革命工人和红卫兵战士誓做你们的坚强后盾，尽我们最大努力，毫不含糊地支持你们的革命行动，帮助你们克服前进道路上的一切困难。我们坚信百分之九十以上的革命群众是支持你们的，我们将永远和你们团结在一起，造反在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。谁胆敢阻拦、破坏新《文汇报》的正常出版发行，我们就采取果断的革命行动，
    战友们，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，奋勇前进吧！最后胜利一定属于誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的革命造反派！
