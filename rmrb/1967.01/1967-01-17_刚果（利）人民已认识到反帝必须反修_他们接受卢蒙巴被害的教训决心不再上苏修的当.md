The people of the Congo (L) have gained profound insights from reflecting on the murder of Lumumba and the subsequent developments in the Congo (L). They clearly recognize that U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism are the chief culprits in suppressing and betraying the Congolese people's national liberation movement.

A Congolese nationalist fighter lamented, "The American imperialists have caused us much suffering, but we did not expect that the Soviet revisionists would cause us such great losses. Now we clearly understand their enormous harm."

According to foreign newspapers, the Soviet modern revisionists who once betrayed Lumumba are now supporting the criminal who, under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, murdered Lumumba. The Congolese newspaper *African Messenger* recently reported that the Soviet newspaper *Pravda* had shamelessly praised, saying that the "Mobutu government's" decision to restore relations with the Soviet Union is "more realistic."

However, the Congolese patriots have seen through the conspiracy of the Soviet revisionist leadership. They pointed out, "This is another manifestation of the U.S.-Soviet collaboration to dominate Africa and the world. We will never be fooled by them again." They firmly believe that only through armed struggle can they achieve complete liberation.

Congolese patriotic fighters have expressed their determination to remember Chairman Mao's words in the "Statement Supporting the Congolese People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression": "Strengthen national unity, persist in protracted struggle, the Congolese people will surely win, and U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated." Chairman Mao's words have greatly inspired the Congolese people's patriotic armed struggle and have become their guiding principle.

    刚果（利）人民已认识到反帝必须反修
    他们接受卢蒙巴被害的教训决心不再上苏修的当
    据新华社布拉柴维尔十五日电  刚果（利）人民在回顾卢蒙巴被害和刚果（利）后来的事态发展中受到了深刻的教育，他们清楚地认识到美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义是镇压和出卖刚果（利）人民的民族解放运动的罪魁祸首。
    一位刚果民族主义战士悲痛地说：“美帝国主义者使我们遭受到许多痛苦，可是我们并没有预料到，苏联修正主义者会多次使我们受到这样大的损失。现在我们已经清楚地知道了他们的巨大危害性。”
    据外国报纸报道，曾经出卖卢蒙巴的苏联现代修正主义者现在正在为美帝国主义扶植下的、杀害卢蒙巴的凶手之一蒙博托捧场。刚果（利）的《非洲信使报》最近报道说，苏联《真理报》曾经发表一篇文章无耻地吹捧说，“蒙博托政府”决定同苏联重建关系是“比较现实的”。
    但是，刚果（利）的爱国者看穿了苏修领导集团的这个阴谋。他们指出，“这是美苏合作企图统治非洲和全世界的又一表现。我们决不会再上他们的当了”。他们坚信，只有通过武装斗争才能获得彻底解放。
    刚果（利）爱国战士表示要牢牢记住毛主席在《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》中说的一句话：“加强民族团结，坚持长期斗争，刚果人民必胜，美帝国主义必败。”毛主席的这句话大大鼓舞了刚果（利）人民的爱国武装斗争，并成为他们斗争的指南。
