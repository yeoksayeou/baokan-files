A Xinhua News Agency report from January 2nd states: In the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country welcomed the year 1967. Amidst a revolutionary fighting atmosphere, they launched a wave of studying the New Year's Day editorials of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, and used them to guide their revolutionary actions. The more the broad revolutionary masses study, the clearer their minds become, the brighter their eyes shine, the more confident they are, and the more ardent their fighting spirit. They pointed out: This editorial conveys the highest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, issues a new call to arms, and reveals the brilliant future of China's socialist revolution. It will inspire us to continue to advance bravely in the storm of class struggle and achieve the final victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary masses in various places emphasized in their studies that no matter how many twists and turns there are on the road ahead, as long as we continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, and resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, we can thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line and overcome all obstacles to carry the cultural revolution to the end. Revolutionary masses in various places have also expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the call of the editorial, further strengthen the great alliance of the revolutionary masses centered on the proletariat, form an even more powerful vast revolutionary army, fully carry forward the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in the new year, launch a nationwide, all-around class struggle, making the flames of the cultural revolution burn even more fiercely in all fields across the country.

After studying the editorial, broad revolutionary workers felt their responsibilities were heavy and were determined not to disappoint the great leader Chairman Mao's expectations. They would become the main force of the cultural revolution, launch a high tide of the cultural revolution in industrial and mining enterprises, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in factories, and uproot the roots of revisionism. Revolutionary workers at Anshan Steel said excitedly: This editorial conveys the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao. We steel workers must listen to every word and follow every instruction. We workers have boundless love, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao has entrusted us workers with great expectations and responsibilities, and we will not disappoint him. We will stand by the blast furnace, with our hearts for all of China and our eyes on the world, resolutely complete the great political tasks of 1967, seize the revolution, promote production, and achieve greater victories in both revolution and production. Revolutionary workers in Changchun, Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Lanzhou, and other places organized study sessions and widely propagated the New Year's Day editorial during the New Year celebrations. Workers said: 1967 is a year to launch an unprecedented scale of great revolution, a year to launch a general offensive against a handful of capitalist roaders in power and the ghosts and monsters in society, and a year to further deepen the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line. We, the working class, must high hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, and bravely advance against the wind and waves. Revolutionary workers in Nanchang City emphasized after studying the New Year's Day editorial that the working class must take the lead in unconditionally implementing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, strive to master Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thoughts, dare to struggle, and be good at struggling, unite the majority, and isolate the stubborn enemies to the greatest extent, overthrow and expose the bourgeois reactionary line, and launch a new high tide of the cultural revolution in industrial and mining enterprises.

The publication of the New Year's Day editorials of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine greatly boosted the confidence of 500 million peasants to carry out the cultural revolution in the countryside in a magnificent manner. More than 5,400 representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants from Changsha County, Hunan Province, who were attending a meeting, enthusiastically hailed the editorial as "excellent!" They excitedly said: Chairman Mao is far-sighted and broad-minded. We must listen to his words and launch a great cultural revolution in the countryside, making it thorough, deep, and complete. Many poor and lower-middle peasants in the rural communes of Fuzhou's suburbs listened to the broadcast of the editorial again and again, becoming more and more excited. They said: The New Year's Day editorial speaks our hearts and is a beacon guiding the cultural revolution in the countryside. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai-style advanced units across the country, Nanluangou Brigade, Ping Mountain County, Hebei Province, said after studying the editorial: If we do not push the cultural revolution to factories and the countryside and launch a great class struggle nationwide, we will not be able to uproot the roots of revisionism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer again. Broad poor and lower-middle peasants in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Anhui, and other provinces all expressed their determination to follow the direction indicated in the editorial, use the Sixteen Points as a weapon, carry out the cultural revolution in the countryside, study Chairman Mao's works, solve the issues of the Four Clean-ups and the re-examination of the Four Clean-ups in the cultural revolution, seize the revolution, promote production, and strive for greater harvests in the socialist revolution and agricultural production this year.

Revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards who have been at the forefront of the cultural revolution were inspired and more ardent in their fighting spirit after reading the New Year's Day editorial. They expressed their determination to plan and organize in 1967's cultural revolution to go to factories and the countryside, implement the combination of revolutionary teachers and students with the broad masses of workers and peasants, and create better conditions to complete the struggle, criticism, and transformation of schools. Many revolutionary young people in Shandong Province held New Year celebrations with workers and peasants on the Long March, studying and discussing the New Year's Day editorial together. They said: Seeing the clear class standpoint of the poor and lower-middle peasants, seeing the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong in building a new socialist countryside, and seeing their iron hands, there is enough for us to learn from for a lifetime. The laborization of intellectuals and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of schools must start from learning from workers and peasants. Revolutionary teachers and students in Jiangsu Province listened to the New Year's Day editorial on the Long March and expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, walk the path of combining with workers and peasants. They said: Sitting in a three-square-meter classroom forever will not cultivate revolutionaries. Revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards in Yinchuan, Xining, Kunming, and other places, based on the spirit of the editorial, began discussions and summaries of their experiences in the cultural revolution in their schools and localities, sent out batches of propaganda vehicles to factories and the countryside for propaganda, and prepared to go to workers and peasants. The revolutionary young people said: This editorial, in accordance with Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, points out the direction for revolutionary students, which has extremely far-reaching significance and is a strategic measure to cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. Many revolutionary young people expressed their determination to be good students of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, humbly learn from them, work, study, and discuss cultural revolution issues together with them. Revolutionary students in Guiyang City expressed their determination to unite with the main force of the cultural revolution, the masses of workers and peasants, form a vast army, and carry the cultural revolution to the end.

Revolutionary cadres in various local party and government organs and revolutionary intellectuals in the cultural field, after seriously studying the editorial, all expressed their determination to further break through the rules and regulations and those restrictive conditions and frameworks that hinder the revolution, go to the masses, and together with workers, peasants, and revolutionary students, criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and fight against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Revolutionary cadres in party and government organs in Taiyuan, Harbin, and other places expressed their determination to go out of their units and systems, go to society, go to the masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary students, learn from them, share their breath and fate, fight together, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and establish Mao Zedong Thought, carrying the cultural revolution to the end. They must, through the mass movement of the cultural revolution, thoroughly realize the proletarian revolutionization of party and government organs.
