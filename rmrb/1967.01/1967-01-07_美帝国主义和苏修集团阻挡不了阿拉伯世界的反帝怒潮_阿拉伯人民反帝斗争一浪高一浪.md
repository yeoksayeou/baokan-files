In 1966, the anti-imperialist struggle of the 100 million Arab people across the vast region of West Asia and North Africa further deepened and developed, especially the struggle against the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, which surged like a stormy tide, wave after wave.

Throughout the year, U.S. imperialism, in order to maintain its important strategic and economic interests in the Arab world, intensified its aggression in this region. It increased arms supplies to and incited Israel to carry out aggression, desperately tried to forge the "Islamic Pact," wantonly trampled on the Arab people's oil rights, and carried out subversive and sabotage activities in Arab countries. The long-suffering peoples of various Arab countries have repeatedly risen up to wage resolute struggles against U.S. imperialism.

	Defeat the U.S. Lackey Israel

Israel is a dagger stuck in the heart of the Arab world by U.S. imperialism. At the beginning of last year, the United States delivered 200 tanks and 80 jet fighters to Israel. With the encouragement and instigation of the United States, Israel launched more than a dozen provocative attacks on Syria throughout the year. On November 13, Israel went even further, brazenly dispatching a large number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks to launch a large-scale invasion in the western border region of Jordan, primarily targeting the Palestinian people. This once again ignited the anti-imperialist fury in the hearts of the Arab people. A massive wave of demonstrations against U.S.-Israeli aggression and against the Jordanian government's unreasonable suppression swept across both banks of the Jordan River, especially in the West Bank region where Palestinians reside. Tens of thousands of workers, students, women, and citizens took to the streets, shouting, "Down with U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel!" "Armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine!" Now, this just struggle is further developing with the strong support of the peoples of various Arab countries.

	Oppose the New Aggressive Alliance

Since the end of 1964, U.S. and British imperialism have been plotting a bigger conspiracy, attempting to establish a new aggressive alliance, the "Islamic Pact," in the entire West Asia and North Africa region. However, as soon as this new plot of U.S. and British imperialism was exposed, it was seen through and firmly opposed by the Arab people. Arab public opinion quickly pointed out that this pact was manipulated by the United States and Britain, aimed at suppressing the Arab people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle and interfering in the internal affairs of Arab countries. Throughout last year, many leaders and mass organizations in Arab countries issued statements and passed resolutions, further condemning this imperialist plot.

	Defend Oil Rights

Throughout the year, Arab countries and peoples have been fighting to defend their national interests and resist the brutal economic plunder by imperialism led by the United States, especially on the oil issue, waging uninterrupted and fierce struggles against imperialism. On December 8, Syria decided to nationalize the assets of the "Iraq Petroleum Company," owned by U.S., British, French, and Dutch capital, in Syria as compensation for the company's unreasonable delay in paying Syria's transit oil taxes, and announced an increase in foreign oil transit taxes.

Syria's struggle to reclaim its legitimate oil rights from imperialism has received widespread support from Arab countries. On December 18, thousands of Iraqi workers, students, and citizens held a demonstration in the capital Baghdad in support of Syria's actions, shouting slogans such as "Down with imperialism!" On December 11 and 12, the U.S. oil pipeline in Saudi Arabia was blown up in multiple places by angry Arabs. Now, the Arab people's struggle for oil rights continues to develop.

	Seek Liberation Through Armed Struggle

In the British-occupied South Yemen, the Arab people's armed struggle continues and has achieved new victories. Of great significance is that the South Yemen nationalists are learning to apply Chairman Mao's great military thoughts on guerrilla warfare in their battles, flexibly and mobilely annihilating the imperialist aggressors' combat effectiveness. According to a military responsible person of the National Liberation Front of the occupied South Yemen, from the beginning of last year to the end of November, the South Yemen guerrillas launched 1,279 attacks and explosions on British military camps, armories, airports, and other targets, killing and wounding more than 800 British soldiers, striking fear into the hearts of the British colonial forces. In Oman, the people's armed struggle is also continuing, repeatedly striking the British colonialists.

Through the practice of anti-imperialist struggles, the Arab revolutionary people have deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct guideline for their struggle for national liberation, and the Chinese people are their reliable friends in the national liberation struggle. The Palestinian people believe that the Palestinian issue can only be resolved, as Chairman Mao pointed out, through armed struggle, not through the United Nations platform. A soldier of the Palestinian Liberation Army said, "Chairman Mao and the Chinese people occupy the greatest position in our hearts, which is unchangeable and unshakable."

	Expose the Traitorous Face of the Soviet Revisionists

Throughout the year, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has been colluding with U.S. imperialism, acting in concert, and increasingly exposing its traitorous face of fake support and real betrayal in front of the Arab people. At the beginning of last year, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique proposed that the Palestinian Arabs should engage in so-called "Tashkent spirit" with the U.S. imperialist tool Israel; on December 5 of the same year, the Soviet "Pravda" newspaper published an editorial that did not mention a word about the U.S. aggression in the Middle East but loudly proclaimed that what helps the people build their future is not the battlefield but the construction site.

The Arab people have given a severe refutation to the fallacies of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique serving the interests of U.S. imperialism. A Palestinian youth said that the Soviet revisionist clique verbally supports Palestine, but in politics, economy, and diplomacy, it colludes with the U.S. imperialist tool Israel.

The development of the situation in the Arab world over the past year shows that regardless of whether U.S. imperialism intensifies aggression, British colonial forces suppress, imperialist oil companies exert economic pressure, or the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique betrays, they cannot block the anti-imperialist tide of the Arab people, nor can they save imperialism from its doomed fate. The awakened Arab people are smashing imperialist aggression and rule along the path they have chosen for themselves. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "If the U.S. monopoly capitalist clique insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably one day be hanged by the people of the whole world. Other U.S. accomplices will meet the same fate."

    美帝国主义和苏修集团阻挡不了阿拉伯世界的反帝怒潮
    阿拉伯人民反帝斗争一浪高一浪
    一九六六年，处在横跨西亚北非广阔地区内的一亿阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争进一步深入发展，特别是反对全世界人民公敌美帝国主义的斗争怒潮汹涌澎湃，一浪接着一浪。
    一年来，美帝国主义为了保持它在阿拉伯世界的重要战略利益和经济利益，日益加紧对这一地区的侵略活动。它加紧武装和纵容以色列进行侵略，竭力拼凑“伊斯兰条约”，肆意蹂躏阿拉伯人民的石油权利，并对阿拉伯国家进行颠覆破坏活动。忍无可忍的阿拉伯各国人民，不断起来同美帝国主义进行了坚决的斗争。
        打倒美帝走狗以色列
    以色列是美帝国主义插在阿拉伯世界心脏的一把尖刀。在去年年初，美国把二百辆坦克和八十架喷气式战斗机运交以色列。在美国的纵容和唆使下，去年一年内，以色列对叙利亚的挑衅进攻就达十几次。十一月十三日，以色列变本加厉，悍然出动大批飞机、大炮、坦克，在约旦西部边境地区发动了矛头主要针对巴勒斯坦人民的大规模侵略。这又一次点燃了阿拉伯人民心中的反帝怒火。一个声势浩大的反对美、以侵略，反对约旦当局无理镇压的示威浪潮席卷约旦河两岸，特别是巴勒斯坦人聚居的约旦河河西地区。成千上万的工人、学生、妇女、市民纷纷走上街头，高呼：“打倒美帝国主义和它的走狗以色列！”“武装斗争是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一道路！”现在，这一正义斗争在阿拉伯各国人民的大力声援下正在进一步发展。
        反对新的侵略性联盟
    美、英帝国主义从一九六四年年底开始策划一个更大的阴谋，企图在整个西亚北非地区建立一个新的侵略性联盟——“伊斯兰条约”。但是，美英帝国主义的这个新阴谋一露头，就被阿拉伯人民识破，遭到坚决反对。阿拉伯舆论很快就指出，这个条约是受美国和英国操纵的，是为了扑灭阿拉伯人民的反帝革命斗争，干涉阿拉伯国家的内部事务。去年一年内，阿拉伯国家的许多领导人和群众组织纷纷发表谈话和通过决议，进一步谴责帝国主义的这一阴谋。
        维护石油权益
    阿拉伯国家和人民一年来为了维护民族利益，反对以美国为首的帝国主义残酷的经济掠夺，特别在石油问题上，同帝国主义进行了不断的激烈斗争。叙利亚在去年十二月八日决定没收美、英、法、荷资本拥有的“伊拉克石油公司”在叙利亚的全部财产，作为这家公司无理拖欠叙利亚过境石油税的抵偿，并宣布提高外国石油过境税。
    叙利亚向帝国主义夺回合法石油权利的斗争，得到了阿拉伯国家的普遍支持。数以千计的伊拉克工人、学生、市民于十二月十八日在首都巴格达举行示威支持叙利亚的行动，他们高呼“打倒帝国主义”等口号。美国在沙特阿拉伯境内的输油管在十二月十一日和十二日有多处被愤怒的阿拉伯人炸毁。现在，阿拉伯人民为石油权利而进行的斗争仍在继续向前发展。
        以武装斗争求解放
    在被英国殖民者占领的南也门，阿拉伯人民的武装斗争继续在坚持，并且不断取得新的胜利。具有重大意义的是，南也门民族主义战士在战斗中正在学习运用毛主席关于游击战争的伟大军事思想，机动灵活地消灭帝国主义侵略者的有生力量。据被占领的南也门解放阵线的一位军事负责人宣布，从去年年初到十一月底为止，南也门游击队对英国军营、军火库、机场等袭击和爆炸达一千二百七十九次，打死打伤英军八百多人，打得英国殖民军胆战心惊。在阿曼，人民的武装斗争也在坚持，不断给英国殖民主义者以打击。
    阿拉伯革命人民通过反帝斗争的实践，深刻地认识到，毛泽东思想是他们争取民族解放的唯一正确指针，中国人民是他们所进行的民族解放斗争的可靠朋友。巴勒斯坦人民认为，解决巴勒斯坦问题只能像毛主席所指出的那样，进行武装斗争，而不能靠联合国的讲坛。一位巴勒斯坦解放军的战士说：“毛主席和中国人民在我们心目中占有最大的位置，这是永远不可改变和不可动摇的。”
        识破苏修的帮凶嘴脸
    一年来，苏联修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，配合行动，在阿拉伯人民面前越来越暴露出它那假支持、真出卖的帮凶嘴脸。去年初，苏联修正主义领导集团曾提出要巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人同美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列搞所谓“塔什干精神”；同年十二月五日苏联《真理报》又发表社论，对美国在中东的侵略政策只字不提，却大肆叫嚷说什么“有助于人民建设他们未来的，不是战场，而是建设工地”。
    阿拉伯人民对苏联修正主义领导集团为美帝国主义利益效劳的谬论，给予严厉的驳斥。一位巴勒斯坦青年说，苏联修正主义集团口头上说支持巴勒斯坦，但是在政治上、经济上和外交上却同美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列进行勾结。
    一年来阿拉伯世界局势的发展说明，不管美帝国主义加紧侵略也好，英国殖民军的镇压也好，帝国主义石油公司施加经济压力也好，苏联现代修正主义领导集团的叛卖也好，都不能阻挡阿拉伯人民的反帝怒潮，更不能挽救帝国主义的失败命运。觉醒了的阿拉伯人民正在沿着他们自己选定的道路来粉碎帝国主义对他们的侵略和统治。正像毛主席所指出的那样：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”
