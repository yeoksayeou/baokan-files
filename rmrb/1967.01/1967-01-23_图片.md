	Street art is a vibrant and dynamic form of expression that reflects the spirit of the times. It is a visual language that speaks to the hearts of the people, capturing the essence of their struggles, hopes, and aspirations. In the streets of our great nation, artists have taken to the walls, using brushes and paints to create powerful images that tell the stories of our revolution and our people.

	The works featured in this selection are a testament to the creativity and passion of our artists. They depict scenes of everyday life, from the hardships faced by workers and peasants to the joyous celebrations of our victories. Each piece is a snapshot of our collective journey, a reminder of where we have come from and where we are headed.

	These street artworks are not just decorations; they are calls to action. They inspire us to continue the struggle, to fight for a better future, and to never forget the sacrifices made by those who came before us. They are a visual reminder of our shared history and our shared destiny.

	As we look at these artworks, let us be reminded of the power of art to inspire and to mobilize. Let us be inspired to create our own art, to tell our own stories, and to contribute to the ongoing revolution. The streets are our canvas, and the future is ours to paint.
