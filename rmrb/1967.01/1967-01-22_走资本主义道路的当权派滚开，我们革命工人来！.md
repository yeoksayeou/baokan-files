	The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not act, who will? We are revolutionary workers of the proletariat. If we do not rebel against capitalism and revisionism, who will? The power usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the power usurped by a few stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, if we do not seize it, who will? We must overthrow all reactionary forces, sweep away all harmful elements! We must smash the old world to pieces, overturn the old system, and shatter it to smithereens!

	Chairman Mao often teaches us that the fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. With power, we have everything. Without power, we lose everything. In a class society, in class struggle, to forget about power is to forget about politics, to forget about the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism, and to become an economist, an anarchist, or an utopianist, which is sheer foolishness.

	Why do we need to seize power? Seventeen years ago, the Party and Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to overthrow the armed counter-revolutionaries through armed revolution, seizing power and saving the working class and the broad masses of laboring people from the abyss. However, the struggle for power is far from over; it is only the first step of the Long March. The bourgeoisie and their agents are constantly attempting peaceful evolution. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in the places and units they occupy, have usurped Party power, state power, and financial power, attempting to restore capitalism in our country. Especially since the Cultural Revolution began, they have, in order to deceive their way through and keep their official hats, become even more frantic, using the power they have usurped to brutally suppress revolutionary rebels who bravely expose their anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes. Our East Is Red Commune alone has had 151 revolutionary rebel workers labeled as a "counter-revolutionary clique." For a time, dark clouds rolled in, and malicious waves surged. That handful dared to act so wantonly and impose white terror because we did not have power in our hands. Therefore, we must seize power. We solemnly declare: Down with the capitalist-roaders in power! We revolutionary workers will take over! On the evening of the 17th, our East Is Red Commune at the Beijing First Cotton Textile Mill seized their power and established a Revolutionary Production Temporary Committee, seizing all political, economic, and production powers in our mill! We revolutionary rebels are red warriors defending Mao Zedong Thought. Our hearts are the reddest, and our bones are the hardest. Even if the sky falls, we can prop it up! Even if the earth sinks, we can fill it in! We are upright revolutionaries! There has never been a savior; we must liberate ourselves!

	"For seventeen years since liberation, our factory has always been a socialist enterprise under the Party's leadership. Whose power are you seizing now?" This is the view of a confused person. The issue now is not whether there is power to seize or not, nor is it whether to seize or not to seize, but it is a must to seize power, to seize it thoroughly. In our factories, mines, and enterprises, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have, in politics, persecuted workers, rewarding those who comply and eliminating those who resist, imposing bourgeois dictatorship on revolutionary workers; in technology, they have monopolized it personally, often raising the banner of "technical innovation" to build "monuments" for themselves; in production management, they have faithfully implemented the Soviet revisionists' one-man management, acting arbitrarily. Over the past decade, the departments they have controlled have already shown signs of partial capitalist restoration, and the proletariat cannot exercise dictatorship over the bourgeoisie. Our mill is a very prominent example. We revolutionary rebel workers must seize back the power usurped by them. If we do not seize it, our socialist enterprise will turn into a capitalist enterprise; if we do not seize it, thousands and thousands of people will lose their heads; if we do not seize it, the color of our motherland will change; if we do not seize it, the wheels of world revolution will roll backward!

	"Power should be jointly managed by various mass organizations and cannot be monopolized by you alone." A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a few stubborn elements who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line do not dare to openly oppose the seizure of power, but they raise the bourgeois banner of "democracy and freedom," secretly inciting some workers who do not understand the truth to engage in anti-seizure power struggles with us revolutionary rebels, even manipulating some mass organizations to attempt to share the proletarian power, changing their appearance, playing tricks, preserving their strength, and preparing for a bigger counterattack.

	We say, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are irreconcilable; all power can only be monopolized by the proletariat and cannot be monopolized by the bourgeoisie. The proletariat monopolizing power is proletarian dictatorship. For you bourgeois gentlemen, it is to monopolize power, to adopt a policy of high pressure, to "dictate." Otherwise, if power is given to you, we proletarian revolutionary rebels will suffer. We revolutionary rebels seize power not to seek the private interests of a small clique but to seek the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the laboring people. All revolutionary comrades will definitely stand firmly with us. You attempt to create public opinion, deceive, and incite some workers who do not understand the truth to struggle for power with us proletarian revolutionary rebels, which is in vain and a pipe dream!

	"You are too extreme, too radical; you can take it slow." This is the view of a "good-hearted" person who fears chaos and fears revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolution is an uprising, a violent action by one class to overthrow another." Seizing power is a life-and-death class struggle. If you do not seize the bourgeoisie's power, the bourgeoisie will seize yours. Seizing power is the focal point of current class struggle. The enemy will neither lay down their butcher's knife nor suddenly become a Buddha. Kindness to the enemy is cruelty to the people. Seizing power must be done quickly, thoroughly, and completely. Not a minute can be wasted, not a second can be delayed. We must seize power with a sense of urgency. Those who advocate "extremism, radicalism, and taking it slow" are, consciously or unconsciously, maintaining reactionary forces and helping the bourgeoisie. We proletarian revolutionary rebel workers have red hearts and firm wills, the sharpest vision, the most sensitive smell, and the strongest fighting spirit. Our task is to realize all power to the revolutionary rebels. The enemy will not surrender, so we must annihilate it. "The golden monkey wields a thousand-catty cudgel, and the jade sky is cleansed of ten thousand dusts." The future world will definitely belong to the revolutionary rebels! All revolutionary rebels unite, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight out a brilliant new world!

　　走资本主义道路的当权派滚开，我们革命工人来！

    “天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”我们是无产阶级革命造反派工人。资本主义、修正主义的反，我们不造，谁造？被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所篡夺的权，被极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线顽固分子所篡夺的权，我们不夺，谁夺？我们就是要打倒一切反动势力，横扫一切害人虫！我们就是要把旧世界打个落花流水，把旧制度搅个天翻地覆，砸个稀巴烂！
    毛主席经常教导我们，革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权，就有了一切。没有政权，就丧失一切。在阶级社会里，在阶级斗争中，忘记了政权，就是忘记了政治，忘记了马克思主义的根本观点，变成了经济主义，无政府主义，空想主义，那就是糊涂人。
    我们为什么要夺权呢？十七年前，党和毛主席领导中国人民，用武装的革命打垮了武装的反革命，夺取了政权，把我们工人阶级和广大劳动人民从火海里救了出来。但夺权斗争远远没有结束，只是万里长征走完了第一步。资产阶级和它的代理人无时无刻不在搞和平演变。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在他们盘踞的地方和单位，篡夺了党权、政权、财权，妄图在我国实现资本主义复辟。特别是文化大革命开展以来，他们为了蒙混过关，保住自己的乌纱帽，他们更是以十倍的疯狂，利用被他们篡夺过去的权力，对勇敢起来揭露他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想罪行的革命造反派工人，进行残酷镇压。我们东方红公社就有一百五十一个革命造反工人被打成了“反革命集团”。一时，乌云滚滚，恶浪阵阵。那一小撮人敢于那样胡作非为，实行白色恐怖，就因为我们手里没有权。所以，我们非要夺权不可。我们庄严地宣布：走资本主义道路的当权派滚开，我们革命工人自己来！我们京棉一厂东方红公社在十七日晚就夺了他们的权，成立了革命生产临时委员会，把我厂政治、经济、生产等等大权，统统夺了过来！我们革命造反派是保卫毛泽东思想的红色战士，我们的心最红，骨头最硬，天塌下来我们能顶住！地陷下去我们能填平！我们是顶天立地的革命造反者！从来没有什么救世主，全靠自己解放自己！
      “解放十七年来，我们工厂一直是在党领导下的社会主义企业，你们现在要夺谁的权？”这是糊涂人的观点。现在不是无权可夺的问题，也不是可夺可不夺的问题，而是必须大夺特夺，非夺不可。在我们厂矿企业，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们在政治上迫害工人，顺之者存，逆之者亡，对革命的工人实行资产阶级专政；在技术上实行个人垄断，经常打着“技术革新”的旗号，为自己树立“纪念碑”；在生产管理上，他们忠实地推行着苏修的一长制，独断专行。十几年来，被他们掌管的部门，已经出现了局部的资本主义复辟，无产阶级专不了资产阶级的政。我厂就是一个很突出的例子。我们无产阶级革命造反派工人，一定要把被他们篡夺去的权夺回到自己手里。不夺，我们的社会主义企业就会变成资本主义企业；不夺，千百万人头就要落地；不夺，祖国的江山就要改变颜色；不夺，世界革命的历史车轮就要倒退！
    “权力应由各群众组织共同协商掌管，不能由你们一家独揽”。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，不敢公开反对夺权，却打出了资产阶级“民主、自由”的破旗，幕后挑动一些不明真相的工人跟我们革命造反派进行反夺权的斗争，甚至操纵一些群众组织企图来分享无产阶级大权，改头换面，玩弄花样，保存实力，准备组织更大的反扑。
    我们说，无产阶级这一家和资产阶级这一家是势不两立的，一切权力只能由无产阶级一家独揽，决不能由资产阶级一家独揽。由无产阶级这一家独揽，就是无产阶级专政。对你们这些资产阶级老爷们，就是要大权独揽，就是要采取高压政策，就是要“独裁”。否则，给了你们权，我们无产阶级革命造反派就要受苦。我们革命造反派夺权，不是为了谋取某个小集团的私利，谋的是无产阶级和劳动人民的根本利益。凡是革命的同志是会坚决跟我们站在一起的。你们妄图制造舆论，蒙蔽和煽动一些不明真相的群众同我们无产阶级革命造反派争权，这是枉费心机，白日做梦！
      “你们太过火，太偏激，可以慢慢来嘛。”这是一种“好心肠”人的观点，他们怕乱，怕革命。毛主席教导我们：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”夺权是一场你死我活的阶级大搏斗。你不夺资产阶级的权，资产阶级就夺你的权。夺权是当前阶级斗争的焦点。敌人既不会放下屠刀，也不会立地成佛。对待敌人的仁慈，就是对待人民的残忍。夺权，就要夺得快，夺得全面，夺得彻底。一分钟也不能等，一秒钟也不能停。我们就是要用只争朝夕的革命精神来大夺而特夺。那些“过火、偏激、慢慢来”的论调，实质上是自觉不自觉地在维护反动势力，帮了资产阶级老爷的忙。我们无产阶级革命造反派的工人心红志坚，目光最锐利，嗅觉最灵敏，斗志最旺盛。我们的斗争任务就是要实现一切权力归无产阶级革命派。敌人不投降，就叫它灭亡。“金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”将来的天下，必定是革命造反派的天下！一切革命造反派联合起来，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，杀出一个红彤彤的光辉灿烂的新世界来！
