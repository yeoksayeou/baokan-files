A young clerk from a bookstore in Tokyo, Japan, recently shared with a reporter how he studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought, persisted in struggle, and promoted Chairman Mao's works and Chinese publications.

The young man, who had vigorously promoted *Beijing Review*, *China Pictorial*, and *Chinese Paintings*, said, "In recent times, I have encountered new difficulties in promoting Chinese periodicals. Some people who claim to support Sino-Japanese friendship but actually sabotage it say things like, 'Mao Zedong Thought is harmful to the Sino-Japanese friendship movement,' and 'The content of *China Pictorial* has changed.' They even labeled me as a 'blind follower.' Facing their insults, I studied Chairman Mao's *In Memory of Norman Bethune* again. I thought, how can I serve the Japanese people? By promoting and publicizing truthful magazines to the Japanese people, that is how I can serve them. Chairman Mao's words, 'We must persist in what is correct for the people's benefit and correct what is wrong for the people's benefit,' encouraged me and made me steadfast in my struggle."

He said, "In the struggle, I also studied Chairman Mao's *Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong*. I thought we also have three big mountains in front of us: American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism. We must definitely remove them. Chairman Mao said, 'With firm determination, we can overcome all difficulties and win victory.' Chairman Mao's words gave me courage and made me dare to fight resolutely against them. Although I encountered difficulties at that time, I did not feel isolated because I knew that the path I persisted in was correct and in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. For this reason, I continued to promote the magazines recently."

The young man added, "Recently, I enthusiastically participated in the explanatory work of the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition. To better complete this glorious task, I studied Chairman Mao's *In Memory of Norman Bethune*. I felt that I should use the internationalist spirit of Norman Bethune, regard the cause of the Chinese people as my own, and regard the success of the Chinese exhibition as my duty."

The young man said, "I am still a beginner in studying the 'Three Articles,' but I realize that to do my work better, I cannot do without the 'Three Articles.' Through this struggle and study, I deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is the unsetting sun and the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding light in struggle."

### 在斗争中学习毛主席著作

    在斗争中学习毛主席著作
    日本东京一家书店的一位青年店员，最近向记者畅谈了他如何学习和运用毛泽东思想，坚持斗争，推广毛主席著作和中国出版刊物的故事。
    这位曾经大力推销过《北京周报》《人民中国》和《中国画报》的青年说，最近一个时期，我在推销中国期刊的问题上遇到了新的困难。有一些口头上讲日中友好实际上破坏日中友好的人，说什么“毛泽东思想对于日中友好运动是有害的”，什么《人民中国》的内容变了，他们甚至给我扣上“盲从者”的大帽子。面对着这些人的谩骂，我再次学习了毛主席的《为人民服务》。我想，怎样才能为日本人民服务呢？向日本人民推广宣传真理的杂志，这就是为日本人民服务。毛主席说的“我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”这番话鼓励了我，使我毫不动摇地坚持了斗争。
    他说，在斗争中，我又学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》。我想我们面前也有三座大山，这就是美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义，我们一定能够把它们挖掉。毛主席说，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”。毛主席的话给了我勇气，使我敢于跟他们进行坚决斗争。当时我虽然遇到困难，但是我并不感到孤立，因为我知道我所坚持的道路是正确的，是符合毛主席的教导的。正由于这样，最近我还是继续推销杂志。
    这位青年又说，最近我又满腔热情地参加了中国经济贸易展览会的讲解工作。为了更好地完成这项光荣的任务，我学习了毛主席的《纪念白求恩》。我觉得我应该用像白求恩那样的国际主义精神，把中国人民的事业当作自己的事业，把中国展览会的成功当作自己的义务。
    这位青年说，我还是初学“老三篇”，但是认识到要把工作做得更好，离不开“老三篇”。通过这次斗争中的学习，我深深体会到毛泽东思想是不落的太阳，是马列主义的顶峰。毛泽东思想是我们斗争中的指针。
