At the exhibition of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in Kathmandu, two Nepalese youths visited every day. Each time, they stood by the table displaying Chairman Mao's works and read them with great enthusiasm. On the closing night of the exhibition, after all the visitors had left, they were still there reading Chairman Mao's books. They said: "We must read Chairman Mao's books well. Chairman Mao's words resonate deeply in our hearts. He is the most brilliant and great leader in the world."

    毛主席的话句句说到我们心里
    在加德满都举行的中国文化大革命图片展览会上，有两位尼泊尔青年天天去参观，每次都站在摆着毛主席著作的桌子旁边热心阅读。展览会闭幕那天晚上，观众都离开了，他们还在那里读毛主席的书。他们说：“我们要好好地读毛主席的书。毛主席的话句句说到我们心里，他是世界上最最英明的伟大领袖”。
