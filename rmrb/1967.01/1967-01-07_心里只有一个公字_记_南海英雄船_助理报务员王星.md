Assistant Radio Operator Wang Xing of the cargo ship No. 1018 is a 19-year-old member of the Communist Youth League. He has rapidly grown into a person who is dedicated to public service. On August 29, 1966, during the struggle against American air pirates in the Gulf of Tonkin, he remained fearless and tenacious in the face of danger, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the youth in the era of Mao Zedong.

At 1:30, while Wang Xing was intently studying the works of Chairman Mao on the ship, American air pirates suddenly launched a fierce attack on the cargo ship No. 1018. In the initial moment, Wang Xing felt a bit tense. However, recalling Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," he quickly calmed down. To quickly inform the motherland of the crimes committed by the American aggressors, he braved the enemy's bombing and strafing, rushed out of the room, and sought instructions from the political commissar. Wang Xing quickly recorded the telegraphic message dictated by the political commissar and, with a speed twice as fast as usual, collaborated with radio operator Huang Weichao to accurately send out the telegraphic message exposing the enemy.

After three hours of battle, as the cargo ship was about to sink in the critical moment, Wang Xing's first thought was not his own safety, but how to ensure that state secrets did not fall into the hands of the enemy. After seeking instructions from the political commissar, he calmly burned the documents. As the documents burned page by page and the ship sank second by second, Wang Xing remained unruffled, only preparing to leave the ship after he had seen all the documents turned to ashes.

Just at that moment, he suddenly heard moans from the engine room. Wang Xing recalled Chairman Mao's teachings: "All members of the revolutionary ranks must care for, love, and help each other." He immediately rushed down to the cabin, helped the seriously injured Wu Qin onto the deck, and provided first aid. However, due to the severity of his injuries, Wu Qin soon sacrificed his life. Wang Xing, filled with intense hatred for American imperialism, jumped into the sea and swam towards a nearby island.

On the deserted island, the party cell decided to send someone to swim across the sea to the larger island on the opposite side to seek help from the Vietnamese people. Although Wang Xing was not a strong swimmer, he volunteered to undertake the task of swimming across. He said, "To save comrades, I am willing to sacrifice my life."

During the swim, Wang Xing and Liang Huabao repeatedly encouraged each other with quotations from Chairman Mao. By noon, Wang Xing was hungry, cold, and his legs cramped. Although he struggled to swim forward, he could not keep up with Liang Huabao. Liang Huabao repeatedly stopped to wait for him. Wang Xing several times told Liang Huabao, "You swim faster than me, you go ahead, don't wait for me, saving comrades is the priority." However, Liang Huabao said, "I cannot leave you behind." Saying this, he untied a strap from his life jacket and gave it to Wang Xing to hold, pulling him along. This way, their swimming speed slowed down. Wang Xing thought: if we do not hurry, we might be swept back by the retreating tide. He told Liang Huabao, "To save time, you should go ahead. Now you are only helping me, but if you swim to the other side, you can save more comrades. If saving comrades is the priority, my personal sacrifice is nothing."

Liang Huabao was deeply moved by his lofty communist spirit, repeatedly instructing him to return to the deserted island if he could not continue, before bidding him farewell and swimming ahead alone.

By nightfall, Wang Xing's strength was almost exhausted. Sometimes he would faint in the sea, but upon waking, he would continue to swim forward. He told himself: I must persist in the struggle. To increase his strength, he drank the bitter sea water to stave off hunger. He struggled in the sea for a full 25 hours before he could no longer endure and returned to the original deserted island. Later, with the help of the Vietnamese people, he and his comrades returned to the motherland.

The most important reason Wang Xing could stand out in critical moments is that he always studied the "Three Articles" as his guiding principles, constantly revolutionizing his soul. He wrote in his diary: "A true hero has no 'I.' Only those who are selfless can set high standards for themselves." Wang Xing was an assistant radio operator, but he never considered this his only job. On the ship, whenever he had free time, he would roll up his sleeves and pant legs, helping the crew pull steel cables, paint, clean, and do other tasks.

Wang Xing firmly planted the spirit of public service in his mind. Once, he and a colleague from the department attended a meeting in a guesthouse far from the office. According to regulations, they were allowed to stay there, but to save the state's expenses, he insisted on returning to the office to sleep every night and did not even claim the bus fare.

According to custom, colleagues who had been at sea for a long time were allowed to rest for a few days upon return. However, he never rested after each return from the sea, always volunteering to work. Once, after returning from the ship, he saw that there were few hands and much work, so he voluntarily took on a week of night shifts. Even when he was sick, he insisted on working. Some comrades advised him, "You have a fever and are not feeling well, go rest." But he said, "It's okay, working for the Party is my greatest comfort."

Wang Xing, by persistently using the "Three Articles" to transform his worldview, made rapid political progress. Recently, he was proudly admitted to the Communist Party of China. He said: Chairman Mao is the brightest sun in my heart. I will strive to make Mao Zedong Thought my soul and dedicate all my efforts to the revolutionary cause of our country and the world.

    心里只有一个公字
    ——记“南海英雄船”助理报务员王星
    一○一八号货轮助理报务员王星，是一个十九岁的共青团员。他迅速成长为一个一心为公的人。一九六六年八月二十九日，在北部湾和美国空中强盗的斗争中，他临危不惧、英勇顽强，充分表现出毛泽东时代的青年的英雄气概。
    一时三十分，正当王星在船上聚精会神地学习毛主席著作时，美国空中强盗突然对一○一八号货轮发动了疯狂的攻击。开始的一瞬间，王星的心情有点紧张。但是一想到毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他立刻镇定起来。为了把美国强盗的罪行迅速告诉祖国，他冒着敌机的轰炸扫射，冲出房间，去请示政委。王星迅速记下政委口述的电报，以比平时快一倍的速度，协同报务员黄伟超，准确地发出了揭露敌人的电报。
    经过三个小时的战斗，在货船快要下沉的紧急时刻，王星首先想到的，不是个人的安危，而是怎样保证不使国家的机密文件落在敌人手里。他请示了政委后，镇静地把文件烧毁。文件在一页一页地烧，船在一分一秒地下沉，王星毫不慌乱，亲眼看到全部文件烧成灰烬才准备离船。
    正在这时候，忽听机舱里有呻吟声。王星想到毛主席的教导：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”他立即飞奔下舱，把受了重伤的伍钦扶上舱面，进行救治。但是，由于伤势过重，伍钦同志很快就牺牲了。王星怀着对美帝国主义的无比仇恨，跳进大海向附近的海岛游去。
    在荒岛上，党小组决定派人泅渡过海，到对面大岛上找越南人民联系。尽管王星水性不好，他却坚决地要求担负泅渡任务。他说：“为了救同志，我宁愿牺牲自己的生命。”
    在泅渡中，王星和梁华保不断用毛主席语录来互相鼓舞。游到中午时分，王星又饿又冷，腿又抽起筋来。虽然他极力地向前游，但始终跟不上梁华保。梁华保不断地停下来等他。王星几次对梁华保说：“你游得比我快，你先游，不要等我，救同志要紧。”但是，梁华保却说：“我不能把你丢下。”说着，就解开救生衣的一条带子，交给王星牵着，拖着他游去。这样，游的速度更慢，王星心想：如果不争取时间游过去，就有被退潮冲回的危险。他对梁华保说：“为了争取时间，还是你先游吧，你现在帮助的只是我一个人，如果你游过去，就会救出更多的同志。只要能救出同志们，我个人牺牲了没有什么。”
    梁华保被他这种崇高的共产主义精神所感动，再三嘱咐他实在不行就退回荒岛去，然后才和他告别，单独向前游去。
    到了晚上，王星气力更加不支了，有时在海上昏迷过去，醒来时他又继续往前游。他对自己说：我一定要坚持斗争下去。为了增加体力，他就喝苦涩的海水充饥。他在海上搏斗了整整二十五个小时，实在支持不住才又回到原来的荒岛。后来他和同志们一起在越南人民的帮助下回到祖国。
    王星在关键时刻能挺身而出，最重要的原因是他平时把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，不断地在灵魂深处闹革命。他在日记上写着：“真正的英雄，是没有‘我’字的。只有无私的人，才能用高标准要求自己。”王星是一个助理报务员，但他从不把这当作唯一的工作。在船上，他一有空，就把袖子一捋，裤子一卷，不是帮助船员拉钢缆，就是帮助搞油漆、清洁等工作。
    王星把“公”字牢牢扎在脑子里。一次，他和科里的一个同志在远离机关的一间招待所开会。按照规定，他们是可以住在那里的，但是为了给国家节省开支，他却每晚回到机关去睡，连乘公共汽车的车票也不报销。
    按照惯例，出海久了回来的同志，是可以休息几天的。但是，他每次出海回来，从不休息，总是抢着工作干。一次，他从船上回来，看到人手少，工作多，就主动地一连值了一个星期的夜班。他病了，还坚持工作，有的同志劝他说：“你发烧，不舒服，回去休息吧。”但他说：“不要紧，为党多做点工作就是我最大的舒服。”
    王星由于坚持用“老三篇”改造世界观，政治上进步很快。最近，他光荣地参加了中国共产党。他说：毛主席是我心中最红最红的太阳。我一定要努力把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，为我国和世界革命事业贡献出自己的一切力量。
