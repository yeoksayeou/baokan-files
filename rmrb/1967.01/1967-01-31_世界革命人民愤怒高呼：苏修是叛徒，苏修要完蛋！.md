The world's revolutionary people angrily shout: The Soviet revisionists are traitors, the Soviet revisionists will perish!

Exposing the Traitor's Face

A statement given by five Latin American students in Cuba to a Xinhua News Agency reporter says: "We Latin American students condemn the savage atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership against Chinese students." "This outrageous situation once again exposes the true face of the Soviet revisionist leadership and their hatred towards the Chinese people."

A South American revolutionary told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership fully reveal their fascist nature. He said, "They cannot save themselves from destruction by doing this; they can only expose their ugly traitorous faces."

Degeneration into Fascism

Students from Asia, Africa, and Latin America studying in Bulgaria expressed great indignation over the brutal suppression of Chinese students in Europe by the Soviet revisionists in Moscow's Red Square.

An African student angrily said, "Shameful! Shameful! They are worse than imperialists. Today, we see more clearly who are the revolutionaries and who are the counter-revolutionaries."

A student from Asia said, "The Soviet revisionists have become fascists; they have nothing in common with Marxism-Leninism."

Another student pointed out: The blood of Chinese students has been shed more than once on Soviet soil. The Soviet revisionists fear the truth and fear revolution, and they use fascist methods against revolutionary students. When I studied in the Soviet Union, I personally experienced the fascist behavior of the Soviet revisionists. There is no socialism there at all.

Like Devils Fear the Sun

A Burmese writer told a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the 30th that the savage suppression of Chinese revolutionary students by Soviet modern revisionists once again shows to the world that they fear the eternal truth of Mao Zedong Thought, just as devils fear sunlight.

A Burmese peace activist said: "The Soviet modern revisionists committed this fascist atrocity because they are terrified of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. They know that this revolution will accelerate the complete collapse of imperialism and revisionism."

Doing the Same as the U.S. Imperialists

African progressive students studying in Cairo strongly condemned the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in brutally suppressing Chinese students in Europe, and expressed their complete sympathy and support for their Chinese brothers armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought.

A group of East African students were shocked by the Soviet revisionists' atrocities. One student said, "The Soviet revisionists fear the truth. They always want to do evil."

Another student from southern Africa pointed out: "What the Soviet revisionists did is the same as what the U.S. imperialists do. The quotations from Chairman Mao read by Chinese students at the mausoleums of Lenin and Stalin are the truth. The Soviet revisionists fear the truth."

　　世界革命人民愤怒高呼：苏修是叛徒，苏修要完蛋！
    暴露了叛徒嘴脸
    五位在古巴的拉丁美洲学生交给新华社记者的一个声明说：“我们拉丁美洲学生谴责苏联修正主义领导集团对中国学生的野蛮暴行。”“这一令人愤慨的情况，再次揭穿了苏联修正主义领导集团的假面具和他们对中国人民的仇视。”
    一位南美革命者对新华社记者说，苏联修正主义领导集团的这一暴行完全说明了他们的法西斯本性。他说，他们这样干挽救不了他们灭亡的命运，而只能暴露他们的丑恶的叛徒嘴脸。
    堕落成为法西斯
    亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国在保加利亚的留学生，对苏修混蛋们在莫斯科红场残酷镇压中国留欧学生一事表示极大的愤慨。
    一位非洲学生愤怒地说：“可耻！可耻！他们比帝国主义还坏。今天，我们更看清了，谁是革命者，谁是反革命者。”
    一位来自亚洲的学生说：“苏修已经变成法西斯，他们同马克思列宁主义毫无共同之处。”
    还有的学生指出：中国学生的鲜血已不止一次洒在苏联的土地上。苏修害怕真理，害怕革命，竟对革命学生采取法西斯手段。我在苏联学习时，亲身体会到苏修的法西斯行为，那里根本没有社会主义。
    象魔鬼害怕太阳
    一位缅甸作家三十日对新华社记者说，苏联现代修正主义者野蛮镇压中国革命学生的暴行，再次向全世界表明，他们害怕毛泽东思想这个永恒的真理，就象魔鬼害怕阳光一样。
    一个缅甸和平战士说：“苏联现代修正主义者干出这种法西斯暴行，是因为他们对中国的无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死。他们知道，这场革命将加速帝国主义和修正主义的彻底垮台。”
    干得跟美帝一样
    在开罗学习的非洲进步留学生，怀着极大的愤慨，强烈谴责苏联修正主义统治集团野蛮镇压中国留欧学生的法西斯暴行，并且表示他们完全同情和支持用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国兄弟。
    一批东非学生对苏修的暴行感到震惊，其中一位学生说，苏联修正主义者害怕真理。他们总想干坏事。
    另一个非洲南部的学生指出：“苏联修正主义者所做的就象美帝国主义者一样。中国学生在列宁和斯大林的陵墓前朗诵的毛主席语录是真理。苏联修正主义害怕真理。”　（据新华社讯）
