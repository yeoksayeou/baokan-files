Before studying Chairman Mao's works, our family seemed to have no different opinions. Whatever we did, it was either I listening to my spouse, or my spouse listening to me, with the children following the adults.

After studying Chairman Mao's works, the consciousness of our family members has improved. However, since everyone's effort in studying differs, the level of consciousness improvement also varies: those who study well improve faster, while those who study poorly improve slower. When it comes to handling issues of public versus private interests, our family members often have differing opinions.

How do we handle differing opinions? We bring these problems to our family study sessions of Chairman Mao's works. The "Old Three Articles" are the golden key, and family meetings are a good method. Since last June, we have held over thirty family meetings, each time studying the "Old Three Articles" and solving many problems. For example, last autumn during the harvest, my spouse only wanted one child to go and pick up the grain, insisting on keeping the other two at home to feed the pigs. The three children disagreed with their mother and did not follow her instructions. I seized this opportunity to hold a family meeting and study "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Through the study, my spouse's consciousness was raised, and she reflected, "I still have not eradicated my selfish and selfish thoughts. Last year, the children picked quite a bit of grain. This year, the grain they pick will all go to the collective, and I don't want to send more people. Compared to Comrade Bethune, the difference is like heaven and earth. He sacrificed his life for the interests of the Chinese people, and I can't even pick a bit of grain for the collective. From now on, I will resolutely eliminate my selfish thoughts." After my spouse's thoughts were straightened out, she arranged the children well: the eldest daughter cut the grain, the second daughter cooked and took care of the youngest, and in the morning, she went to pick up the grain and in the afternoon, she fed the pigs. The third and fourth children were dedicated to picking grain for the team, and she herself also went to work cutting grain. This season, the whole family picked over three hundred catties of grain for the team.

Now we have established a revolutionary rule in our family: "Only allow for the public, not for the private." We must break private interests and establish public interests, holding the "public" high above our heads and trampling the "private" into the mud. Whatever is for the "public," no matter who proposes it, we must firmly support it; whatever is for the "private," no matter who does it, we must criticize it.

Recently, my eldest daughter Jin Ying and a few other children together did a winter wheat trial, using the family's wheat seeds. Her mother found out about this and thought the children did the right thing, even praising them.

    活学活用“老三篇”树立革命家风
    湖北蒲圻县西凉公社二大队  余共军
    没有学习毛主席著作以前，我们一家人好像没有什么不同的意见。办什么事都是我听我爱人的，或者我爱人听我的，小孩随着大人转。
    学了毛主席著作，一家人的觉悟都有提高。但是，各人学习努力不同，觉悟提高也就不一样：学得好的提高快一些，学得差的提高慢一些。在处理公与私的问题上，一家人的意见就往往不一样。
    意见不一样怎么办，我们就带着这些问题，全家人学习毛主席著作。“老三篇”是把金钥匙，家庭会是个好方法。去年六月以来，我们开了三十多次家庭会，每开一次家庭会就学习一次“老三篇”，解决了很多问题。例如，去年秋收组织孩子拣谷，我爱人只让一个孩子去，要留两个在家扯猪草。三个孩子反对他妈，不听她的指挥。我抓住这个问题，开了一个家庭会，学习了《纪念白求恩》。通过学习，我爱人提高了思想觉悟，她检讨说：“我还是自私自利思想没铲除。去年几个孩子拣了不少谷。今年拣的要全部归公，我就不愿多去人。和白求恩同志比，真是天地之差。人家为了中国人民的利益，牺牲了自己的生命，我为集体拣点谷都不行，我今后下决心要革掉私心。”我爱人思想弄通后，她把几个孩子安排得很好：大女儿割谷，二女儿烧火带小孩，上午抽空去拣谷，下午扯猪草，第三第四个孩子专门为队里拣谷，她自己也出工割谷。这一季，全家为队里拣了三百多斤谷。
    现在我们全家立了一个革命规矩：“只准为公，不准为私”。要破私立公，把“公”字高高举到头上，把“私”字踩到烂泥坑里去。凡是为“公”，不论那个提出，都要坚决支持；凡是为“私”，不论那一个做了，都要批评。
    最近，大姑娘金英和几个孩子一块搞冬播小麦试验，把家里的麦种拿去种了。她妈发现了这件事，认为孩子们做得对，还表扬了她们。
