Revolutionary masses and Red Guards from Zhuhai County, Guangdong Province, along with 4,000 compatriots from Macau, held a New Year celebration in the Gongbei area adjacent to Macau today. The Macau compatriots were warmly welcomed by the local masses upon their arrival.

At the celebration, representatives from the Zhuhai County Red Guards and revolutionary masses, as well as representatives from Macau, gave speeches. They jointly hailed the great achievements of the motherland in 1966 and fervently wished our great leader Chairman Mao a long life.

The representatives from Zhuhai County Red Guards and revolutionary masses praised the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Macau. They strongly protested against the fascist bloody crimes of the Portuguese authorities in Macau and sternly warned that they would not allow the Kuomintang bandits to operate in Macau in the future. They unanimously expressed their determination to fight alongside the patriotic compatriots in Macau to achieve the four conditions proposed in the statement by the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office and the six demands of the Macau compatriots until complete victory is achieved.

During the celebration, the Red Guards from Zhuhai County's Vanguard Middle School and the local garrison's performance troupe, together with workers and student representatives from Macau, performed over 30 wonderful programs praising our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The performances were enthusiastically received by the more than 8,000 attendees.
