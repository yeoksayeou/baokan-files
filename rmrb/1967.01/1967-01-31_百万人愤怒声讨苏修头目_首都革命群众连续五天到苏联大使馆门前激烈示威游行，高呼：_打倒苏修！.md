Millions of People Furiously Denounce Soviet Revisionist Leaders
Revolutionary Masses in the Capital Have Continued for Five Days to Protest Violently in Front of the Soviet Embassy, Shouting: "Down with Soviet Revisionists!"

New China News Agency, January 30th
Revolutionary masses in the capital continued to protest in front of the Soviet Embassy today, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist scoundrels in Moscow against our students in Europe, and strongly condemning these scoundrels for instructing the personnel of the Soviet Embassy in Iraq to brutally beat our students. They pointed out that this is another blood debt owed by the Soviet revisionist scoundrels to our people, and this blood debt must be repaid.

The intense protests have lasted for five days, with more than a million revolutionary masses participating. From early morning to late night, angry crowds have continuously surged from all directions in the city towards the Soviet Embassy on Anti-Revisionism Road. The area in front of the embassy has turned into a sea of anger and a courtroom for judging Soviet revisionist leaders. Countless revolutionary workers, peasants, students, cadres, and many residents from the streets have come to protest, holding up portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, carrying red flags, and holding up placards. The walls along Anti-Revisionism Road and the streets and alleys throughout the city are covered with slogans and cartoons denouncing the Soviet revisionist scoundrels. Loudspeakers on propaganda vehicles have been continuously denouncing the fascist crimes of the Soviet leadership. Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible weapon, and revolutionary people love it dearly, while class enemies fear it greatly. In front of the Soviet Embassy, many people who came to protest have been collectively reciting the Little Red Book of Chairman Mao's Quotations aloud and shouting slogans: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live, long live, long long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" The Soviet Embassy has kept its doors tightly shut all day. Sometimes a few personnel come out to provoke the crowd, but they are driven away by the protesters.

Protest letters have been sent to the Soviet revisionist scoundrels like cannonballs. The letters point out that the fascist atrocities committed by the Soviet revisionist leadership against our unarmed students do not show their strength but rather expose their paper tiger nature, revealing their fear of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. One day, the Soviet people will rise up to rebel against them, seize their power, and smash revisionism to smithereens. The red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will eventually fly over the Kremlin!

More than a hundred forestry workers from the Badaling Forest Farm in Beijing braved the cold today to come to the Soviet Embassy to protest from over a hundred miles away. Along the way, they sang songs based on Chairman Mao's quotations. They solemnly declared: A small group of Soviet revisionist scoundrels, listen up: Aren't you afraid of Chairman Mao's quotations? Today, we are here to loudly recite Chairman Mao's quotations. Chairman Mao's books are the foundation of our revolution. We will read Chairman Mao's books for a lifetime and let Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout the world, letting the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly over the birthplace of the October Revolution.

    百万人愤怒声讨苏修头目
    首都革命群众连续五天到苏联大使馆门前激烈示威游行，高呼：“打倒苏修！”
    新华社三十日讯　首都广大革命造反派和各界革命群众今天继续到苏联大使馆门前举行示威游行，最强烈地抗议苏修混蛋在莫斯科血腥镇压我留欧学生的法西斯暴行，最强烈地谴责这些混蛋指使苏联驻伊拉克大使馆人员野蛮殴打我留学生。他们指出，这是苏修混蛋们对我国人民欠下的又一笔血债，这笔血债一定要偿还。
    激烈的示威游行已经持续了五天，前来示威的革命群众已达一百万人。从每天清晨到深夜，愤怒的人群不断从全城四面八方涌向反修路的苏联大使馆。大使馆门前变成了一片愤怒的海洋，变成了审判苏修头目的场所。数不清的革命工人、革命农民、革命师生、革命干部以及许多街道居民，举着伟大领袖毛主席的画像和马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的画像，扛着红旗，拿着标语牌前来举行示威。反修路两旁的墙壁上以及全城的大街小巷，贴满了声讨苏修混蛋的标语和漫画。广播宣传车整天以战斗的声音声讨苏修领导集团的法西斯罪行。毛泽东思想是威力无穷的武器，革命人民最最热爱它，阶级敌人最最害怕它。在苏联大使馆门前，许多前来举行示威游行的人手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》集体高声朗读，并不断高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁，万万岁！”苏联大使馆整天大门紧闭，有时出来一两个人员企图向群众进行挑衅，也被示威群众轰得夹尾而逃。
    大批抗议书象炮弹一样射向苏修混蛋。抗议书指出，苏修领导集团对我手无寸铁的留学生所采取的法西斯暴行，丝毫不表明它们的强大，恰恰暴露了它们纸老虎的原形，暴露了它们害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命、害怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想的虚弱本质。总有一天，苏联人民会起来造它们的反，夺它们的权，把修正主义砸个稀巴烂。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的红旗，终将飘扬在克里姆林宫的上空！
    北京市八达岭林场反修造林队的一百多名林业工人，今天冒着严寒从一百多里外来到苏联大使馆门前示威。一路上，他们高唱毛主席语录歌。他们庄严地说：一小撮苏修混蛋们听着：你们不是害怕毛主席语录吗？今天我们就是要大声朗读毛主席语录。毛主席的书是我们革命的根本，我们要读一辈子毛主席的书，要让毛泽东思想传遍全世界，要让毛泽东思想红旗飘扬在十月革命的故乡。
