	The Heart is Red, Fear Not the Black Pot
	Cook	Wú Chángfú

	To carry the pots for the revolution, I went through a struggle within myself.

	Last April, our company went on a field exercise, and the leadership assigned me to carry the pots. I am a cook, so if they tell me to carry the pots, I will carry them! But who would have thought that along the way, the people were so enthusiastic. Every time we passed through a village or a town, there were drums and firecrackers to welcome and send us off. In this atmosphere, my vanity surfaced. Looking at the two big black pots, I got angry. Carrying them on my shoulders didn't feel right. The crowd smiled at me, and I thought they were laughing at me for carrying the pots. The children chased after me, and I thought they were making fun of me. Later, during the day's march, I would push the pots onto someone else to carry, but at night, I would volunteer to carry them. Because at night, no one could see me carrying the pots.

	Once, when we entered a county, the crowd lined the streets to welcome us, pressing in tightly. Their warmth was indescribable. But when I carried the two big pots through, the welcoming crowd immediately made way for a large path, as if they were intentionally making me look bad. My face burned, and my heart felt heavy, as if I wanted to burrow into the ground.

	The next day, I started to back down: "I can't carry this pot anymore. Let someone else carry it!"

	The supply sergeant had long since noticed my thoughts. That night, he organized us to study Chairman Mao's writings on serving the people. He read aloud, word by word, Chairman Mao's quotations: "All our work comrades, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people..." After finishing, he said: "Chairman Mao doesn't look down on us for carrying pots and cooking. Comrade Zhang Zedong died making charcoal, and Chairman Mao wrote a special article to commemorate him; in the article, Chairman Mao also specially mentioned that even if a cook dies, we should hold a memorial service!" These words were like small cannonballs, hitting my heart one by one. I said: "Carrying the pots isn't that I'm afraid of the weight, it's just that the crowd always looks at me and laughs at me, I can't stand it!" The supply sergeant then smiled and said to me: "Don't look at people with colored glasses. The crowd looks at us, surrounds us, sends us firewood and rice, all of which are enthusiastic welcomes for us. Who is laughing at us?"

	That night, I couldn't sleep at all. I flipped through "In Memory of Norman Bethune" over and over again, and thought over and over about Chairman Mao's teachings on wholeheartedly serving the people. I dug into the root of my own thoughts. Yes! Chairman Mao values us so much, the masses don't look down on us, why do I feel that carrying the pots is shameful? This is clearly my old thoughts playing tricks on me. What "cook soldiers" and "pot carriers," I've confused my own thoughts. I decided to overthrow my old thoughts and clean them out.

	"The heart is red, fear not the black pot." I told the leadership, let me carry the pots. On the new journey, I carried the pots, walking with more strength, and my heart felt more joyous.

    “心红不怕锅黑”
    炊事员　吴长福
    为革命挑锅，我是经过一番思想斗争的。
    去年四月，我们连出去野营，领导上分配我挑锅。我是炊事员，叫我挑锅我就挑吧！谁知，一路上群众对我们非常热情，每过一村一镇，都是锣鼓声迎，鞭炮声送。在这个场合下，我的虚荣心上来了，望着两只大黑锅生气了，挑在肩膀上也不自在了。群众朝着我笑，我就感到是笑我挑锅；小朋友追着我跑，我也以为是出我的洋相。后来，白天行军，我就把锅推给别人挑，晚上行军，我就争着挑。因为夜里挑锅没有人看见。
    有一次，进入县城，群众夹道欢迎，挤得紧紧的，那个亲热劲，简直没法说。可是我挑着两口大锅走过来，欢迎的人群就马上让出一条大道，好像是有意给我难看似的。我脸上发烧，心里发闷，恨不得一头钻进地里去。第二天，我就打起退堂鼓：“我挑不了这锅，还是换个人挑吧！”
    我的活思想，司务长早就摸着了。那天晚上，他组织我们学习毛主席有关为人民服务的论述。他一字一句地念了毛主席语录：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，……”，他念完了就说：“毛主席可没小看我们挑锅烧饭的。张思德同志是烧炭牺牲的，毛主席专门写文章纪念他；在文章里，毛主席还特别讲了炊事员死了，也要开追悼会！”这些话，像小炮弹一样，句句打在我的心头上。我说：“挑锅我不是怕重，就是群众老是看我笑我，我受不了！”司务长又笑着对我说：“别用有色眼镜看人，群众看我们，围着我们，给我们送柴送米，都是热情接待我们，那里是笑我们呢！”
    这一夜，我怎么也睡不着。我一次又一次地翻阅《为人民服务》，一次又一次地回想毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导，挖自己思想的根子。对啊！毛主席这样器重我们，群众也没有小看我们，为什么自己觉得挑锅难看呢？这明明是自己的旧思想在作怪，什么“伙伕兵”啊，什么“挑锅的”啊，把自己的思想搞糊涂了。我决心要把旧思想斗倒，清除掉。
    “心红不怕锅黑”。我跟领导上说，这锅还是让我挑吧。在新的路程上，我挑着锅，越走越有劲，越走心越欢。
