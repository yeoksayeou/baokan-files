The "China Photo Exhibition" held in Kathmandu has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the Nepalese people. After visiting the exhibition, the audience enthusiastically praised "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world," "Chairman Mao is the greatest and wisest leader of all the people of the world," and "Mao Zedong Thought is the most correct and greatest thought."

An audience member named Ramkumar wrote enthusiastically in the guest book: "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world." He said, "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought has swept away the dark atmosphere created by revisionism, exposed the true face of the revisionists, and guided the oppressed people of the world onto the correct path. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China has added new chapters to the principles of Marxism-Leninism." He exclaimed, "Mao Zedong Thought is invincible! Long live the great teacher of the proletarian revolution, Chairman Mao!"

Two farmers who came to visit bowed respectfully in front of Chairman Mao's portrait as soon as they entered the door. One of the farmers told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency, "Chairman Mao is the greatest and wisest leader of all the people of the world. I love Chairman Mao deeply."

In the exhibition hall, many people read Chairman Mao's works every day. An audience member named Pachaspati said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the most correct and greatest thought. Mao Zedong Thought guides the people of the world in their struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. With Mao Zedong Thought, people will definitely achieve victory." Another audience member named Ramish Prasad wrote, "Those who wish to develop their own country as rapidly as China must study Mao Zedong Thought."

The audience enthusiastically praised the revolutionary actions of the Chinese Red Guards in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. A young man said, "I love the Red Guards because their actions are revolutionary. The Red Guards are making revolution by breaking the old and establishing the new according to Chairman Mao's thoughts. They are the good successors of the revolutionary people of the world."

The audience also enthusiastically praised China's firm stance against imperialism and revisionism and in support of national liberation movements. An audience member named Lal wrote in the guest book, "Long live China's policy of supporting national liberation movements around the world!" He pointed out that in recent times, modern revisionists have even surpassed imperialists in their anti-China propaganda. He also said, "The various slanders made by the revisionists are precisely to cover up the tricks they play against the world revolution."

The "China Photo Exhibition" was organized by the Chinese Embassy in Nepal. The exhibition featured photos of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, socialist construction, and the Chinese people's support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    尼泊尔人民热情称颂伟大英明的领袖毛主席
    毛泽东思想是最正确最伟大的思想
    世界人民有了毛泽东思想，反帝反修斗争就一定取得胜利
    新华社加德满都电  在加德满都举办的“中国图片展览会”受到了尼泊尔广大人民的热烈欢迎。在参观后，观众们纷纷称颂“毛主席是世界人民心中的红太阳”，“毛主席是全世界人民最伟大最英明的领袖”，“毛泽东思想是最正确最伟大的思想”。
    一个名叫拉姆库马尔的观众在留言簿上热情地写道：“毛主席是世界人民心中的红太阳。”他说：“毛泽东思想的光辉横扫了由修正主义一手制造出来的阴暗气氛，揭穿了修正主义者的真面目，引导着全世界被压迫的人民走上了正确的道路。现在在中国开展的无产阶级文化大革命使马克思列宁主义的原理又增添了新的篇章。”他欢呼：“毛泽东思想是战无不胜的！无产阶级革命的导师毛主席万岁！”
    前来参观的两位农民一进门就在毛主席像前热烈地向毛主席致敬。其中的一位农民对新华社记者说：“毛主席是全世界人民最伟大最英明的领袖。我无限热爱毛主席。”
    在展览厅里，每天有许多人在阅读毛主席著作。一位名叫帕恰斯帕提的观众说：“毛泽东思想是最正确最伟大的思想。毛泽东思想指导世界人民进行反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争。人们有了毛泽东思想，就一定会取得胜利。”另一位名叫拉米什·普拉沙德的观众写道：“凡是希望像中国那样快速发展自己国家的人，都必须学习毛泽东思想。”
    观众们热烈赞扬中国红卫兵在无产阶级文化大革命中的革命行动。一个年青人说：“我爱红卫兵，因为红卫兵的行动是革命的行动。红卫兵按照毛主席的思想正在破旧立新闹革命。他们是世界革命人民的好后代。”
    观众们还热烈赞扬中国的反帝反修和支持民族解放运动的坚定立场。一位名叫拉尔的观众在留言簿上写道：“中国支持全世界民族解放运动的政策万岁！”他指出，最近以来，现代修正主义者在反华宣传方面甚至超过了帝国主义者。他还说：“修正主义者进行的种种诽谤，正是为了掩盖他们反对世界革命所玩弄的骗局。”
    “中国图片展览会”是中国驻尼泊尔大使馆举办的。展览会上展出了中国无产阶级文化大革命、中国的社会主义建设和中国人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争等方面的图片。
