De Gaulle Criticizes U.S. Aggression in Vietnam

Requires U.S. Troops to Withdraw but Avoids Mentioning the Just Cause of the Vietnamese Side

New China News Agency, Paris, January 1st

French President De Gaulle, in his New Year's broadcast and television speech on the eve of 1966, strongly criticized the U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

He said: "A war is raging in Southeast Asia. This is an unjust war, because in fact it is caused by the armed intervention of the United States in Vietnamese territory. This is a detestable war, because it is a war of a great power trampling a small country."

De Gaulle has long been dissatisfied with the U.S. entering Indochina to replace France. In this New Year's speech, he once again clearly demanded that U.S. troops withdraw from Vietnam. He said, the United States "must withdraw its troops back to its own territory and end this confrontation." However, De Gaulle, starting from France's interests, implied that as long as the United States makes the decision to withdraw troops, France is ready to promote negotiations, but avoids mentioning the only way to solve the Vietnamese problem: the United States must completely accept the four-point proposal of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam.

In order to exclude U.S. influence in Western Europe, break the U.S. monopoly in political deals with the Soviet revisionist leadership, and further promote the policy of "peaceful evolution" towards the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, De Gaulle, in this speech, once again advocated the establishment of a "Europe of Europeans." He said, in the coming year, France will continue to work for the "reconciliation of the European continent," promote the gathering of countries on this continent, and establish a "Europe of Europeans." He clearly stated that his government "will establish friendly and beneficial relations with the Soviet Union," "restore close ties with Eastern European countries," and at the same time "strive to establish an economic, and perhaps one day a political, bloc of the six Western European countries."

    戴高乐抨击美国侵越战争
    要求美国撤军但避而不谈越南方面的正义主张
    新华社巴黎一日电  法国总统戴高乐在一九六六年除夕发表新年广播和电视讲话时，猛烈抨击美国对越南进行侵略战争。
    他说：“战争正在东南亚激烈地进行。这是一场非正义的战争，因为事实上这是由美国对越南领土的武装干涉引起的。这是一场可憎恶的战争，因为这是一个大国蹂躏一个小国的战争。”
    戴高乐一向不满美国进入印度支那取代法国的地位。在这次新年讲话里，他又一次明确要求美国军队撤出越南。他说，美国“必须把它的军队撤回本土，结束这场较量。”但是，戴高乐又从法国的利益出发，暗示只要美国一旦作出撤军的决定，法国就准备促进谈判，却避而不提解决越南问题的唯一途径：美国必须完全接受越南民主共和国的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明。
    为了排斥美国在西欧的势力，打破美国垄断同苏联修正主义领导集团作政治交易的局面，以及对苏联和东欧国家进一步推行“和平演变”的政策，戴高乐在这次讲话中再次鼓吹建立“欧洲人的欧洲”。他说，在未来的一年中，法国将为欧洲“大陆和解”而继续工作，促使这个大陆上的国家集结在一起，建立“欧洲人的欧洲”。他明确宣布，他的政府“将同苏俄建立友好和有益的关系”，同东欧国家“重建昔日的紧密联系”，同时“努力建立西欧六国经济的、也许有朝一日是政治的集团”。
