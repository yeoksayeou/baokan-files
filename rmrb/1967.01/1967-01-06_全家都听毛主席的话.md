The whole family listens to Chairman Mao's words
Hu Zhengqiu
Female Militia Deputy Platoon Leader of Shuanghu Brigade, Changsha County, Hunan Province

Last year, the brigade organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's works. The production team appointed me as an instructor to work with everyone to carry out the revolutionization of thought. Some comrades said to me, "To make a revolution, start from your own home. Why doesn't your grandfather come? Your mother and younger brother haven't come either!" Hearing this, I thought they were right. The revolution must start from oneself. How can one's own home not study well? Therefore, I made up my mind to mobilize my family to study Chairman Mao's works. I first mobilized my mother. Besides doing the mobilization work myself, I also asked my father and the women's director to do the mobilization, and held a reminiscence and comparison session at home to study Chairman Mao's quotations. After several rounds of education, my mother finally started studying. My younger brother is a student and listens to me, so it was easy to mobilize him. The last one left was my grandfather. He had suffered a lot in the old society. I saw the modern revolutionary opera "Yang Libei," and used Yang Libei's suffering to remind him of his own. When I talked about Yang Libei, he raised his arm and said, "Look at this arm of mine. It was ruined by the landlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Now it's still not better. In 1947, the Kuomintang sent grain, and the landlord Zhou San pushed the grain quota given to him onto me. If I couldn't pay, they said I was resisting grain delivery and tied me up to take to Changsha. My arm was ruined then. If it weren't for the liberation, who knows what state our family would be in." I asked, "Why didn't you file a complaint?" He said, "At that time, filing a complaint was like 'the eight-character court opens on both sides, with reason but no money, don't come in.' It was the time when Chiang Kai-shek was in power, and the landlords were in charge. It's not like now, with Chairman Mao's good leadership, where the poor are in charge." I also knew his suffering. I intentionally brought up his suffering and compared it with today's happy life to arouse his class consciousness. I said, "In the past, our family of eight had difficulties with food and clothing. Now we have no worries about food and clothing. How did this happen?" He said, "Chairman Mao gave it to us." I then inspired him to say, "Some old people only know Chairman Mao's kindness but don't listen to Chairman Mao's words." He said, "How can I not listen?" I said, "Take you for example. You listen to Chairman Mao's words, so why don't you read Chairman Mao's books? If you listen to Chairman Mao's words and read Chairman Mao's books, your thoughts won't fall behind." He didn't say anything. I picked up Chairman Mao's works and said to him, "Chairman Mao's words are written in this book. Let me read a passage to you." I read "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" to him. When I read the part about the poor peasants, he shed tears of joy and said excitedly, "Chairman Mao's words have touched my heart." He also said, "I am old and confused. If you don't help me, I will surely forget my roots. From now on, I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words and read Chairman Mao's books. As long as I live, I will study Chairman Mao's works every day."

After my family started studying, everyone's thoughts made great progress. The brigade praised our family for actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, carrying out the revolutionization of family thought, and being a "red family." However, after studying for a while, our progress was not fast, and some families had surpassed us. To check each person's study situation, we launched the "compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass" movement. I discussed with my father and established a family evaluation system. At first, we evaluated every ten days, and later, once a month. Having a system also requires setting evaluation criteria. During our first evaluation, we first read Chairman Mao's quotations and then checked ourselves and evaluated each other. My father asked me to speak first, so I said, "Mother is not very proactive in her studies. Father is also just going through the motions. You only wrote a reflection after being notified to come back for the evaluation and pasted it on the wall." My father said, "Although my study is not as good as yours, I have still studied and applied a bit. The reflection is because I was on a business trip and didn't write it out. I sincerely accept the criticism and will study better in the future." I continued, "Grandfather has studied a bit and applied a bit, but not regularly, and he doesn't help others enough." As for my younger brother, I said, "You don't apply it well. Sometimes you fight and argue with others. Today, during the evaluation, you were dozing off and not paying attention." Without others pointing out my name, I checked myself and said, "Since studying, I have solved some problems, but I am not responsible enough for the accounting work, and my level as an instructor is not high, which has affected the team's work and study." My father, mother, and younger brother all said, "You study better, can apply it actively, and love the collective." Only grandfather was not convinced and said, "Mother praises her daughter, and everyone praises themselves. Everyone's study is not very good, but your daughter's study is good." My father said, "She used to not be willing to work in the countryside, but now she is willing, and her study is also more regular. To compare and learn, there must be a model, and to catch up and surpass, there must be a target." My mother also agreed with my father's opinion. After a full discussion, everyone agreed that I was the one who studied the best in the family. At the end of the evaluation, we read a passage, "Humility makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind. We must always remember this truth." Grandfather said he would definitely learn from his granddaughter and catch up to her. In the past, he always said about the whole family listening to whom, "You listen to your parents, your parents listen to me, and in the end, the whole family listens to me." After the evaluation, he said, "We all listen to Chairman Mao's words. If grandfather's words are in line with Mao Zedong Thought, you listen; if not, you don't listen."

After our family launched the "compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass" movement, everyone's thoughts made even greater progress. Last year, grandfather studied "Moving Mountains with Persistence" and was very enthusiastic. Although he was over seventy, he still wanted to work with the young people to plant rice and accumulate fertilizer. Last year, he worked 1,800 collective work points and was evaluated as a model worker in the brigade. My mother became the women's team leader. In the past, she was not willing to do it, but after studying Zhang Zedong's thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, she also became willing. My father studied the "Three Articles" and worked even more enthusiastically at the red brick factory. My younger brother studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and actively helped his classmates, overcoming the habit of fighting. During the first quarter evaluation last year, everyone in the family was evaluated as an advanced worker.

    “全家都听毛主席的话”
    湖南省长沙县双湖大队女民兵副排长　胡正球
    前年大队组织社员学习毛主席著作，生产队要我担任辅导员，和大家一起搞好思想革命化。有些社员对我说：“要革命就要从自己家里革起，你爷爷为什么不来呀！你妈妈、弟弟也没来呀！”听了这话，我想也是。革命要先从自己头上革起，自己家里不学习好怎么行！于是我下定决心，动员家里的人学习毛主席著作。我先动员妈妈，除了自己去做动员工作以外，还请父亲和妇女主任来动员，并在家里搞回忆对比，学毛主席语录。几方面教育，终于使妈妈学起来了。我弟弟是个小学生，听我的话，好动员。最后就剩下对我爷爷的工作了。他在旧社会受过很多苦，我看了革命现代戏《杨立贝》，就用杨立贝的苦，去引他的苦。讲起杨立贝，他举出手臂说：“你看我这只手，就是被地主、国民党反动派害的，现在还不活翻。一九四七年国民党派粮，地主周三把派给他头上的粮，推到我身上，拿不出就说我抗粮不交，把我反捆解到长沙。我的手臂就是那时候搞坏的。要不是解放，家里还不晓得成个什么样子。”我问：“为什么不去告状？”他说：“那个时候告状，是‘八字衙门两边开，有理无钱莫进来’。那是蒋介石掌权，地主当道。不像现在毛主席的好领导，穷人当家作主。”原来我也晓得他的苦，我有意地把他受的苦翻出来，对照今天的幸福生活，启发他的阶级觉悟。我说：“过去我们一家八口人，吃穿都困难，现在吃穿都无忧，是怎样来的？”他说：“毛主席给的。”我又启发他说：“有的老人呀，光懂得毛主席的恩情，就是不听毛主席的话。”他说：“怎么不听？”我说：拿你来说吧，你听毛主席的话，为什么不读毛主席的书？你要是听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，思想就不会落后了。他不说话了。我拿起毛主席著作对他说：“毛主席的话，写在这本书上，我来念一段给你听。”我把《中国社会各阶级的分析》念给他听，念到贫农那一段，他满面流泪，激动地说：“毛主席的话都讲到我心眼里啦。”又说：“我老糊涂了，你不帮助爷，硬是会忘本。今后一定听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书；活一天就要学一天毛主席著作。”
    我家里的人学起来以后，每个人的思想都有很大进步，大队称赞我们全家活学活用毛主席著作，大搞家庭思想革命化，是“全家红”，在全大队介绍了。但是，我们学了一段时间，提高不快，有的家庭超过了我们。为了检查每个人的学习情况，开展比、学、赶、帮、超运动，我和父亲商量，搞了个家庭评比制度；起初，十天评一次，以后一个月一次。有了制度还要订个评比条件。我们第一次评比时，先读了毛主席语录，然后就自己检查，大家评比。父亲要我先发言，我就讲：“妈妈学习还不太主动。父亲呢？也不过硬。通知你回来评比，才临时写了心得贴在墙上。”父亲就说：“我学的虽然比不上你们，但是，还是学了，也用了一点。心得是因为出差没写出，我诚恳接受意见，以后要更好地学。”我接着说：“爷爷呢，学了一点，也用了一点，但不经常，帮助别人也不够。”弟弟呢？我说：“你还用得不好，有时同别人打架、吵嘴。今天评比时打瞌睡，不认真。”不要别人点我的名，我就自己检查说：“学习以来解决了一些问题，但我对会计工作不够负责，当辅导员水平也不高，影响了队上的工作和学习。”父亲、妈妈、弟弟都说：“你学得比较好，能活学活用，热爱集体。”只有爷爷不服气，他说：“娘夸女，自夸自。个个学得不很好，就是你的女儿学得好。”父亲说：“她过去不安心在农村工作，现在安心了，学习也比较经常。比学要有标兵，赶超也要有目标嘛。”我娘也同意父亲的意见。经过充分讨论，都同意评我为全家学得最好的。评比结束时，又读了一段“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理”的语录。爷爷表示，一定要学孙女，赶孙女。过去他对全家究竟听谁的话，总是说：“你听你爹妈的，你爹妈听我的，归根到底，全家都听我的。”评比后他说：“我们都听毛主席的话。爷的话符合毛泽东思想你就听，不符合毛泽东思想就不听。”
    我们这个家庭的比、学、赶、帮、超搞起来以后，大家的思想有了更大的进步。爷爷前年学了《愚公移山》，非常积极，虽然七十多岁了，还要和青年人一道扮禾、积肥。前年他出集体工做了一千八百多工分，被评为大队的劳动模范。我妈妈当妇女队长，过去不愿意干；学了张思德同志“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想，也安心了。父亲学了“老三篇”，在红砖厂工作更加积极。弟弟学了《纪念白求恩》，主动帮助同学，克服了爱打架的习气。去年第一季度评比时，全家人都评上了先进。
