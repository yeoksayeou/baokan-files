Thousands of people in the capital of Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, held a grand parade on the 12th to celebrate the third anniversary of the Zanzibar Revolution. Participants carried banners with slogans such as "Imperialists must get out of Africa," "No negotiations with imperialism, Zanzibar was liberated through armed struggle," and "We must be vigilant against neo-colonialism." They sang and danced as they marched through the city's main streets.

Tanzania's second vice president, Kawawa, spoke at a mass rally after the parade. He expressed firm support for the armed struggle of the people of Mozambique and other African countries still under colonial rule to achieve liberation. He called on the Mozambican freedom fighters to intensify their armed struggle for liberation.

He urged the people of Tanzania to be ready at any time to defend their country against any aggression from colonialism and imperialism. He emphasized that Tanzania must be built by its own people. On the 12th, various celebratory activities were also held across Tanzania.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Zanzibar, the people of Zanzibar in Tanzania responded to the call of President Nyerere and First Vice President Karume for self-reliance in building Tanzania. They actively participated in voluntary labor.

Recently, about 2,000 workers, farmers, government employees, soldiers, and youth from Zanzibar enthusiastically participated in voluntary labor on a Sunday in the suburbs of Zanzibar City to clear the site for building a factory.

On the morning of the 8th, several hundred people gathered in a coconut grove three miles from Zanzibar City. There, they cleared the construction site for a leather and shoe factory to be built with the help of China. Participants, despite the heat, wielded axes to chop down tall coconut trees.

Tanzania's First Vice President Karume, along with Zanzibar government ministers and leaders of the African-Shetani Party, joined the Zanzibar residents in chopping down coconut trees and transporting the wood. Chinese experts also participated in the labor. Over the past three years since the Zanzibar Revolution, urban and rural residents have actively participated in voluntary labor, such as harvesting rice, building schools, and constructing roads, embodying the spirit of self-reliance.
