The shining example of Norman Bethune is etched in the hearts of Chinese experts working in Mali. They have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works, including "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and have resolved to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune, becoming internationalist warriors. After being sent by the Chinese people to Mali, they have followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, keeping the shining example of Comrade Norman Bethune always in their hearts, serving the people of Mali, and winning praise from the Malian people.

Working with All Their Hearts

Chinese experts share the joys and sorrows with the Malian people, working diligently. In just three or four years, they have successfully test-planted sugarcane and tea trees, completed the construction of a cigarette factory, sugar factory, and match factory ahead of schedule, and are currently building a textile factory and a cinema. These achievements are the crystallized sweat and blood of Malian workers, technicians, and Chinese experts. The Malian people praise the Chinese experts for bringing the "Great Leap Forward" to Mali. They say: Chinese experts are examples of proletarian internationalism.

The Chinese experts who built the sugar factory arrived at the construction site in early 1965. There, they found a wilderness overgrown with weeds and trees. They settled in some mud-walled, thatched-roof huts and began construction. The Chinese experts building the Segou Textile Factory used an abandoned factory building, dividing it into rooms with wooden boards to live in. Without running water, they fetched water from the Niger River, more than a mile away. The Malian government and people cared deeply about the living conditions of the Chinese experts, repeatedly asking if they had any difficulties. But the Chinese experts always replied: We are here to serve the Malian people, not to enjoy ourselves. Many who visited the Chinese experts' living quarters were moved by their spirit of not caring about living conditions, solving problems on their own, and reducing the burden on the Malian side. They said: Some European "socialist" country experts, as soon as they arrived in Mali, demanded villas, cars, and air conditioners, like colonialists. But the Chinese experts, upon arriving in Mali, rolled up their sleeves and worked hard, truly helping the Malian people like brothers.

The Chinese experts live the most frugal lives, but when they work, they are like tigers. To help the Malian people build an independent national economy, Chinese experts often do not rest on weekends and holidays, going to the construction sites to work.

The Chinese experts carefully calculate and find every possible way to save every penny for the Malian people. The experts building the textile factory calculated that buying bricks from a brick factory was expensive, so they organized labor to make cement bricks themselves, making a total of 960,000 bricks, saving Mali more than 10 million Malian francs (equivalent to 100,000 yuan). The Chinese carpenters at the cigarette factory, after the factory was completed, voluntarily made some office furniture for the factory, saving a sum of money for purchasing furniture. The Malian people say: The Chinese experts are like Malian people, always thinking of Mali in everything they do.

Everyone is an Ordinary Laborer

Malian workers say: "Chinese experts working with Malian workers, except for skin color, we cannot tell who is a Chinese expert and who is a Malian worker."

Chinese experts, whether on the construction site or in the factory, as soon as they have free time, see what work needs to be done and rush to do it. They see the ground is dirty, they pick up the broom to sweep; they see the workshop is out of materials, they push the car to fetch materials. The repair technicians also help with packing, and the sheet metal workers also help with painting the walls.

During the construction of the sugar factory, there was an instance where they worked overtime day and night to pour the concrete foundation for the presser. The entire construction site was brightly lit, with machines roaring. All the Chinese experts on the site, whether they were the team leader, engineers, or accountants, all participated in the labor. Some pushed carts, some tamped, some made templates. Chinese and Malian personnel worked together, fighting for 36 hours, quickly and well completing the task of pouring the 280 cubic meter concrete foundation. Seeing this scene, Malian workers said: Chinese experts are all laborers, from them you can see that China is truly a socialist country.

Extremely Devoted to the People

Last September, one day, a heavy rain fell in Bamako overnight. The next day, when the Malian worker Mariogo came to the Chinese-built construction site to work, he looked worried and did not speak. The Chinese expert Xu Fulian was very concerned about him and learned from him that the heavy rain had collapsed Mariogo's house, and his wife's leg was also injured. At this time, Xu Fulian thought of Chairman Mao's teachings in "In Memory of Norman Bethune," determined to learn from Norman Bethune's spirit of selflessness and devotion to the people. So, as soon as he got off work, without resting, he invited four other Chinese experts to find some discarded wood and cement tiles on the construction site, and together they started to repair Mariogo's house. Three hours later, Mariogo's house was repaired, and it was more beautiful and sturdy than before. When the Chinese experts helped repair the house, the nearby Malian residents all gathered around to watch. They stuck out their thumbs and said: "The Chinese experts are good (in Bambara)." When the Chinese experts said this was done as taught by Chairman Mao, the Malian people said: "Chairman Mao is good!"

A Malian worker named Barajila, who worked on the textile factory construction site, came to work one morning with his clothes soaked by the rain. The Chinese expert Yan Genyan saw that he was cold and immediately took off his own clothes to give to him. Barajila said, moved: The Chinese experts are so good, teaching us technology and caring for us like this, no foreigner has ever treated us this well.

Near the residence of Chinese experts working in Bamako, there was a plot of cornfield planted by an elderly Malian woman. Because she was old and weak, the field was overgrown with weeds. The Chinese experts used their weekends to weed the field clean. Later, the corn in that field grew tall and strong. The Malian woman told everyone: The Chinese experts are so good.

The Malian People Thank Chairman Mao

Recently, several Chinese experts completed their work in Mali and were leaving to return to China. When they bid farewell to their Malian colleagues, the Malian workers and technicians earnestly said: Please convey our warm greetings and our boundless admiration to Chairman Mao, wishing him eternal life! And they shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Worker Abdoulaye Traore, when seeing off the Chinese experts, enthusiastically said: "From you, we can see the working spirit of the Chinese people under the cultivation and guidance of the great leader of China—Chairman Mao Zedong. You have left your homeland and families far away to come to Mali to help us build. In your work, you have selflessly and unreservedly taught us technology. In our struggle to build our country, you—people trained by Chairman Mao—are the examples for the Malian people. Although you are about to leave us, we will never forget the deep impression you have left on us. The great friendship between China and Mali is like the Yangtze River and the Niger River, flowing forever. Long live Mao Zedong!"

Machine repairman Sumana said: "In the year and a half we worked with the Chinese experts, from not knowing to knowing, from not understanding to understanding, now we can work independently. You treated us better than brothers, all this is thanks to the Chinese people who gave us selfless aid and the great leader Chairman Mao. The Malian people, like the Chinese people, need Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao has given us the ideological weapon, Chairman Mao is the red sun shining over the world."

Recently, a few more Chinese experts left Mali. Malian workers and technicians came to the Chinese experts' residence to see them off. At this moment of reluctant parting, Malian workers and technicians sang "The East Is Red" together, and then sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." They poured their deep affection for Chairman Mao into this resonant song, asking their Chinese brothers to take it to Beijing.

### 白求恩的光辉榜样铭记在他们心中——记在马里工作的中国专家

    白求恩的光辉榜样铭记在他们心中
    ——记在马里工作的中国专家
    在马里工作的中国专家们反复学习了毛主席的《纪念白求恩》等光辉著作，立志向白求恩同志学习，做国际主义的战士。他们受中国人民的派遣来到马里之后，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把白求恩同志的光辉榜样时刻铭记在自己的心中，为马里人民服务，受到马里人民的称赞。
    全心全意地工作
    中国专家同马里人民同甘共苦，努力工作，在短短的三、四年内试种成功了甘蔗和茶树，比计划规定的期限提前建成了卷烟厂、糖厂和火柴厂，正在兴建着一座纺织厂和一座电影院。这些成就是马里工人以及技术人员和中国专家的汗水和心血的结晶。马里人民称赞中国专家把“大跃进”带到了马里。他们说：中国专家是无产阶级国际主义的榜样。
    建设糖厂的中国专家在一九六五年初来到糖厂工地时，那里是一片野草杂树丛生的荒野，“头上青天一顶，脚下草原一片”。他们就在一些土墙草顶的土房里安家落户，进行建设工程。建设塞古纺织厂的中国专家利用一座废厂房，自己用木板隔成一个个房间住了下来。没有自来水，他们就到一里多路以外的尼日尔河去挑水。马里政府和人民很关怀中国专家的生活，一再询问有没有困难，但中国专家总是回答说：我们是来为马里人民服务的，不是来享受的。许多到过中国专家住处的人都为中国专家不计较生活待遇、自己动手克服困难、尽量减少马里方面负担的精神所感动。他们说：一些欧洲“社会主义”国家的专家，一来到马里，就要别墅、汽车、冷气机，像殖民主义者一样。而中国专家来到马里就挽起袖子努力工作，真是像兄弟一样地真心帮助马里人民。
    中国专家过的是最俭朴的生活，但工作起来却像猛虎一般。为了帮助马里人民建设独立的民族经济，中国专家经常星期日和假日不休息，到工地去劳动。
    中国专家精打细算，千方百计地为马里人民节省每一文钱。建设纺织厂的专家在开工的时候，计算了一下到砖厂去买砖价钱较贵，他们就自己组织人力加工水泥砖，一共加工了九十六万块砖，为马里节约了一千多万马里法郎（相当于十万元人民币）。卷烟厂的中国木工，在工厂盖成后，自动为工厂做了一些办公用的桌椅，节省了一笔购置家具的费用。马里人说：中国专家就像马里人一样，处处为马里着想。
    人人是普通劳动者
    马里工人说：“中国专家同马里工人在一起除了肤色不同外，我们分不出谁是中国专家，谁是马里工人。”
    中国专家不论是在工地上还是在工厂里，一有空闲，看到什么工作就抢着做。他们看见地上脏了，就拿起扫帚扫地，看到车间没有料了，就推着车子去运料。修理机器的技工也帮助装箱，白铁工也帮助粉刷墙壁。
    在糖厂建设期间，有一次日夜加班突击浇灌压榨机的水泥基础，工地上灯火通明，机器轰鸣，整个工地的中国专家，不论是专家组长、工程师、还是会计，一齐参加了劳动，有的推车，有的捣固，有的打样板，中国、马里两国人员，齐心协力，连续作战了三十六小时，又快又好地完成了浇灌这个二百八十立方米的混凝土基础的任务。马里工人看到这种情景说：中国专家人人都是劳动者，从他们身上可以看出中国才是真正的社会主义国家。
    对人民极端热忱
    去年九月间，有一天，巴马科市下了一夜倾盆暴雨，第二天马里工人马里戈到中国援建的工地来上班时愁眉不展，一言不发。中国专家徐福良很关心他，从他那里了解到暴雨把马里戈的住房冲塌了，他的妻子的腿也被压伤了。这时，徐福良想起毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文中的教导，决心要学习白求恩的毫不利己专门利人的精神，对人民要极端热忱。于是刚一下班，也顾不上休息，就约同另外四个中国专家在工地上找了一些废木料和水泥瓦，一齐动手给马里戈修起房子来。三个小时后，马里戈的房子修好了，而且比以前的漂亮而又坚固。当中国专家帮助修房的时候，住在附近的马里居民都围上来看。他们伸出大拇指说：“中国专家阿嘎依（邦巴拉语“好”的意思）。”当中国专家说这是毛主席教导他们这样做的时候，马里人又说：“毛主席阿嘎依！”
    在纺织厂建设工地工作的马里工人巴拉吉拉有一天早上来上班时衣服被雨淋湿了。中国专家严根炎看到他很冷，就立刻拿出自己的衣服来给他换上。巴拉吉拉感动地说：中国专家太好了，教给我们技术，还这样关心我们，从来没有一个外国人像中国专家待我们这样好。
    在巴马科工作的中国专家们的住处附近，有一块玉米地是一位马里老年妇女种的，因为她年老无力，地里长了很多杂草没有锄。中国专家利用星期假日给她锄得干干净净。后来这块地里的玉米长得又高又大，这位马里妇女逢人就说：中国专家真好。
    马里人民感谢毛主席
    不久前，几位中国专家结束了在马里的工作，要离开马里回国。当他们向一起工作的马里朋友告别的时候，马里的工人和技术人员恳切地说：请转达我们对毛主席的热烈问候和我们对毛主席的无限崇敬的心情，祝他老人家万寿无疆！并且高呼“毛主席万岁！”
    工人阿布杜拉耶·特拉奥雷在送别中国专家时热情地说：“从你们的身上，可以看到在伟大的中国领导人——毛泽东主席的培养教导下中国人民的工作精神，你们远离祖国和亲人来到马里帮助我们进行建设。你们在工作中大公无私地、毫无保留地向我们传授技术。在我们建设祖国的斗争中，你们——毛主席教导出来的人，就是我们马里人民的榜样。你们虽然即将离开我们了，但我们永远不会忘记你们给我们留下的深刻印象。伟大的中国和马里两国人民的友谊就像长江和尼日尔河一样永流不息。毛泽东万岁！”
    机器修理工苏马那说：“我们同中国专家工作的一年半来，从不会到会，从不懂到懂，现在我们已能独立工作了，你们待我们比亲兄弟还亲，这一切都要归功于给予我们无私援助的中国人民和伟大领袖毛主席。马里人民同中国人民一样地需要毛泽东思想，毛主席给了我们思想武器，毛主席是普照大地的红太阳。”
    最近又有几位中国专家离开马里，马里工人和技术人员到中国专家的住处来送别，在这依依难舍的时刻，马里工人和技术人员一起唱了一遍《东方红》，又唱了一遍《大海航行靠舵手》。他们把对毛主席的深情热爱都凝聚在这嘹亮的歌声中，托他们的中国兄弟带到北京去。
