China's Economic and Trade Exhibition was held in Kuwait on the afternoon of the 17th and was enthusiastically praised by the Kuwaiti people. Many Kuwaiti visitors expressed their boundless love for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. Some visitors, after touring the exhibition, said: "China has been able to achieve such rapid progress entirely because of the leadership of the great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong."

One visitor, excitedly, told the exhibition staff: "This exhibition has made me understand the great strength of the Chinese people and the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao. The slanders and lies spread by imperialism about New China only show their weakness and their fear of New China's prosperity and strength."

At the exhibition, there is a large photograph of Chairman Mao meeting an elderly Uyghur man. A Kuwaiti visitor stood in front of this photograph for a long time, reluctant to leave. He praised to his Chinese friends: "Such things can only happen in your country."

The opening ceremony of the exhibition was presided over by the Chinese government delegation led by China's Ambassador to Iraq, Cao Chi. Kuwaiti Minister of Commerce and Industry Abdullah Jabir Al-Sabah cut the ribbon for the exhibition. Attending the opening ceremony were more than 300 high-ranking government officials, prominent figures from Kuwaiti society, and foreign diplomats.

　　我经济贸易展览会在科威特举行
　　观众热烈赞扬新中国的迅速进步和繁荣富强
    据新华社科威特十八日电　中国经济贸易展览会十七日下午在科威特隆重开幕，受到科威特人民的热烈赞扬。许多科威特观众表示了对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情。有的观众在参观了展览会后说：“中国能够取得这样高速度的进步，完全是由于有了伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的领导。”
    一位观众激动地对展览馆人员说：“这个展览会使我了解到中国人民的强大力量和毛主席的英明正确的领导。帝国主义对新中国的谣言和诬蔑只能说明他们的虚弱，说明他们害怕新中国繁荣富强。”
    展览会上有一张毛主席接见一位维吾尔族老人的巨幅照片，一位科威特观众在这张照片前看了很久，舍不得离开。他对中国朋友赞扬说：“这种事情只有在你们国家里才有。”
    展览会开幕式是由中国驻伊拉克大使曹痴率领的中国政府代表团主持的。科威特工商大臣阿卜杜拉·贾比尔·萨巴赫为展览会剪了彩。出席开幕式的还有科威特的政府高级官员、社会知名人士和外国使节等三百多人。
