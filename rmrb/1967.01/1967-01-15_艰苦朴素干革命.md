Hard work and plain living are the class characteristics of the laboring people. Struggling hard is a fine tradition of our Party and people's army, a powerful weapon to defeat the enemy, and a precious heritage of the revolution.

Our revolutionary forerunners, under the wise leadership of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, overthrew the three big mountains weighing on the Chinese people, and established New China. In the socialist revolution and socialist construction, the Chinese people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, continued to maintain and carry forward this revolutionary spirit, thereby achieving one great victory after another.

Today, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we revolutionary rebels must carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and always maintain the style of hard work and plain living to thoroughly defeat the class enemy and stand unshakable.

In the past few months, our "Red Sun Commune" of the Geological Institute has gone from nothing to something, from small to big, experiencing a fairly arduous fighting course.

When we responded to Chairman Mao's great call and just started to rebel and make revolution, a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those stubbornly implementing the bourgeois reactionary line played tricks and put heavy pressure on us from all sides. They controlled the means of transportation and propaganda, while we had nothing. However, difficulties cannot frighten revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Having nothing, we still rebel and make revolution. No cars, we have legs; no loudspeakers, we have mouths. No one cooks for us, we set up our own canteens. No rooms for offices, we still hold meetings and write articles outdoors and in corridors. Following Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolutely determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," we finally overcame numerous difficulties, grew and strengthened in the struggle, and organized a mighty revolutionary force.

Now, our forces have changed from the oppressed "minority" to the ruling "majority." At this time, should we still continue to maintain the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and the working style of hard work and plain living?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must make all the young people understand that our country is still a very poor country and that it is impossible to fundamentally change this situation in a short period of time. It all depends on the young people and all the people uniting and struggling for several decades to create a prosperous and strong country with their own hands." We must not, because conditions have improved, flaunt our wealth, show off, or even become lazy and indulge in pleasures.

What is particularly important is that we are Chairman Mao's Red Guards and must always keep our colors bright red. To do this, we must definitely maintain the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and the working style of hard work and plain living. At present, a handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a small number of stubborn adherents of the bourgeois reactionary line, in order to resist the revolutionary masses' exposure and criticism of them, to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, and to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have adopted new and vicious methods such as economism and material incentives. Under such circumstances, if we can maintain the revolutionary style of hard struggle, we can effectively resist the attacks of the bourgeois "sugar-coated bullets," and the enemy's plots will not succeed.

With the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and the working style of hard work and plain living, we can withstand the enemy's hard tactics; when the enemy uses soft tactics, we will not be fooled. Only in this way can we truly achieve the goal of being unbending in the face of force and uncorrupted by wealth. Conversely, without this revolutionary spirit and style, we will surely be frightened by difficulties, and even be softened and gradually "peacefully transformed" by the enemy's combination of hard and soft tactics.

To make revolution, one must not fear hardship; fearing hardship means one is not a true revolutionary!

Let the class enemy's "material incentives" and "sugar-coated bullets" all go to hell! We will persevere in hard work and plain living to do revolution, and we will be true revolutionaries!

    艰苦朴素干革命
    艰苦朴素，是劳动人民的阶级本色。艰苦奋斗，是我们党和人民军队的优良传统，是战胜敌人的强大武器，是革命的传家宝。
    我们的革命先辈，在我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，搬掉了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，建立了新中国。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，我国人民又遵循毛主席的教导，继续保持和发扬这种革命精神，从而取得了一个接一个的伟大胜利。
    今天，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们革命造反派，要想彻底斗垮阶级敌人，并使自己立于不败之地，也必须大力发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，永远保持艰苦奋斗的作风。
    几个月来，我们地质学院“东方红公社”，从无到有，从小到大，经历了一段相当艰苦的战斗历程。
    当我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，刚刚起来革命造反的时候，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的家伙，就玩弄手腕，从各方面对我们施加重重压力。他们掌握了交通工具、宣传工具，而我们则一无所有。但是，困难是吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士的。一无所有，我们也要造反，也要干革命。没有汽车，我有腿；没有喇叭，我有嘴。没有人给我们做饭，我们就自己办食堂。没有房子办公，我们就在室外、在走廊里照样开会、写文章。我们遵循毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”终于战胜了重重困难，在斗争中不断成长、壮大，组织起一支浩浩荡荡的革命队伍。
    现在，我们的队伍已经由被压制的“少数派”变成“掌权”的多数派了。这时候，是否仍然要继续保持艰苦奋斗的革命精神和艰苦朴素的工作作风呢？
    毛主席教导我们说：“要使全体青年们懂得，我们的国家现在还是一个很穷的国家，并且不可能在短时间内根本改变这种状态，全靠青年和全体人民在几十年时间内，团结奋斗，用自己的双手创造出一个富强的国家。”我们决不能因为条件好了，就摆阔气，讲排场，甚至好逸恶劳，贪图享受。
    尤其重要的是，我们是毛主席的红卫兵，要永远保持鲜红鲜红的颜色。要做到这一点，也一定要保持艰苦奋斗的革命精神和艰苦朴素的工作作风。当前，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，为了抵制革命群众对他们进行揭发、批判，为了腐蚀群众的革命意志，扼杀无产阶级文化大革命，采用了经济主义、物质刺激等新恶毒手法。在这种情况下，如果我们能保持艰苦奋斗的革命作风，就能有效地抵制住资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的袭击，敌人的阴谋就不可能得逞。
    有了艰苦奋斗的革命精神和艰苦朴素的工作作风，敌人来硬的，我们顶得住；敌人来软的，我们也不会上当。只有这样，才能真正做到威武不能屈，富贵不能淫。反之，离开了这种革命精神和作风，就必然会被困难吓倒，甚至被敌人软硬兼施，舒舒服服地“和平演变”过去。
    要革命，就不能怕艰苦；怕艰苦，就不是一个真正的革命者！
    让阶级敌人的什么“物质刺激”、“糖衣炮弹”，统统见鬼去吧！我们要艰苦朴素干革命，我们要做一个真正的革命者！
