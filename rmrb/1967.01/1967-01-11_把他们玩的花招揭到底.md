The revolutionary workers of Shanghai have spoken our hearts, boosted our spirits, and we applaud them! We enthusiastically cheer and support their revolutionary spirit and actions.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" is excellent! We workers listen to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely carry out his great directive. We resolutely defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao with our revolutionary actions.

However, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are doing everything they can to oppose the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The small group of people in our Beijing Jade Factory are doing just that. Earlier, they used the pretext of "grasp revolution" to prevent us from producing properly. They put on a show of being "revolutionary," saying, "'Counter-revolutionaries' want to seize our power. Is revolution important, or is production important?" They labeled a part of our factory's workers as "counter-revolutionaries" and "rightists." They used production time to struggle against revolutionary masses, forcing fifty percent of the workers to leave production. We workers are extremely pained, but they are secretly pleased. They not only do not take responsibility, but they push all the blame onto us, saying we are "making trouble" and "sabotaging production." They completely distort right and wrong, confusing black and white!

After the work team withdrew, the revolutionary spirit of the masses returned. They again used production to suppress the revolution, saying things like, "Workers are the masters of the state, production is the virtue of workers, workers should care about production." They also threatened us: no production, no wages. They increased our production tasks, leaving us no time for the Cultural Revolution.

Do they really want to improve production? No, they do not. They are afraid of the revolution, afraid of the masses, afraid of losing their positions, but they are not afraid of failing to complete production tasks. They use the disruption of production to disrupt the proletarian Cultural Revolution. Those power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have paid no attention to production for several months. This is their attitude towards "caring about production."

They are afraid of the revolution, sealing it off in every way, preventing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao from reaching the workers, and preventing revolutionary students from entering the factory to propagate Mao Zedong Thought during their spare time. They incite a part of the masses to drive the students away, labeling them with all sorts of crimes such as "interfering with the revolution" and "sabotaging production."

The facts completely prove that those who are most actively participating in the revolution and most concerned about production are not the handful of people who merely shout "grasp revolution, promote production," but the revolutionary workers. Despite their labeling of many workers as "counter-revolutionaries," we do not abandon production. We still complete our production tasks on time. They tell us to use work time to write "self-criticisms." We say: writing "self-criticisms" is fine, but we cannot afford to neglect production. The production tasks given to us by Chairman Mao, we must complete. Many of our workers refuse to let production stop.

A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line think that if they do not lead production, the workers cannot do a good job. But the workers say: we will still carry out the revolution and production, and we will do it even better! We workers can completely educate ourselves, liberate ourselves, and manage ourselves. In the future, we will more resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," and more resolutely launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois reactionary line. We will smash all new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, push the proletarian Cultural Revolution in our factory to a new high, and achieve double victories in revolution and production!

The bourgeois reactionary line is doomed to fail, the proletarian revolutionary line is bound to win!

    把他们玩的花招揭到底 
    北京玉器厂工人　王仲元　袁广如
    上海革命工人说出了我们工人的心里话，长了我们工人的志气，我们拍手叫好！热烈欢呼！我们坚决支持他们的革命造反精神和革命行动。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，好得很！我们工人最听毛主席的话，坚决执行毛主席这一伟大指示，坚决以自己的革命行动，捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，却千方百计地对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。我们北京玉器厂的那一小撮人就是这样干的。前期他们以“抓革命”为名，不让我们好好生产。装出一副“革命”的样子说：“‘反革命’要夺我们的权，是革命重要，还是生产重要？”他们把我们厂一部分工人打成“反革命”，打成“右派”。他们利用生产时间斗革命群众，迫使百分之五十的人离开生产。我们工人非常痛心，他们却暗自高兴。他们不但不承担责任，反把责任全推给我们，说我们“捣乱”，“破坏生产”。完全颠倒是非，混淆黑白！
    工作组撤走以后，群众的革命劲头又来了。他们又以生产压革命，说什么“工人是国家的主人，生产是工人的美德，工人应当关心生产”。并且吓唬我们：不生产，就不发给工资。还给我们增加生产任务，使我们没有时间搞文化大革命。
    他们是不是真想搞好生产？不是的。他们怕革命，怕群众，怕丢官，就是不怕完不成生产任务。他们通过破坏生产，来破坏无产阶级文化大革命。那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，几个月来对生产不闻不问。这就是他们“关心生产”的态度。
    他们害怕革命，千封锁，万封锁，不让以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同工人见面，不让下厂革命学生利用工余时间宣传毛泽东思想。他们挑动一部分群众，要把学生轰走，给他们加上“干扰革命，破坏生产”的种种罪名。
    事实完全证明，最积极参加革命的，最关心生产的，不是一小撮空喊“抓革命，促生产”的坏家伙，而是革命工人。尽管他们把很多工人打成“反革命”，我们也不放弃生产，我们仍然按时完成生产任务。他们叫我们用上班时间写“检查”。我们说：写“检查”可以，但是要我们耽误生产万万办不到。毛主席交给我们的生产任务，我们一定要完成。我们许多工人就是不让生产停顿下来。
    一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，以为他们不领导生产，工人就搞不好生产了。但是工人说：我们照样干革命，照样搞生产，而且会搞得更好！我们工人完全能够自己教育自己，自己解放自己，自己管理自己。我们今后要更坚决地执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，更坚决地向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火，打垮资产阶级反动路线的一切新反扑，将我们厂的无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新高潮，夺取革命、生产双胜利！
    资产阶级反动路线必败，无产阶级革命路线必胜！
