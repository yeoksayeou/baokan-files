Title: Strike Hard Against Economism

A wind of economism is currently sweeping through society, attempting to use economic bribes to divert the great direction of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and to oppose Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." This is a new counterattack by the reactionary bourgeois line. The propagandists and instigators of economism are guilty of sabotaging the Cultural Revolution and will not escape punishment!

Listen up, you handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and you few stubborn adherents of the reactionary bourgeois line in factories and mines! In the past, you acted like officials and lords, showing no concern for the workers. Many issues directly affecting the workers were ignored by you. Where did you show even a hint of being revolutionary cadres?

Now, when the revolutionary masses rise up to rebel against you, you suddenly change your tune, pretending to care about the workers, saying things like, "We support you in rebelling against unreasonable systems." Pfft! You abuse your power, making promises and handing out money—whether it's additional health subsidies or distributing work uniforms. You try to incite some of the masses to raise issues about wage grades, labor protection benefits, and living welfare, causing a ruckus, attempting to divert the direction of the struggle, protect yourselves, and sabotage the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. This is a new plot and counterattack by the reactionary bourgeois line.

You think you're clever, but you're actually the most foolish. The revolutionary rebels will not fall for your tricks, and we revolutionary students and teachers will not fall for your tricks either. We insist on having Mao Zedong Thought as our banner, on having politics in command, and we will not have money or work uniforms as our banner. We will resolutely repel the new counterattack by the reactionary bourgeois line!

You must immediately stop these conspiratorial activities and surrender to the proletariat, otherwise, you will meet a bad end!

    给经济主义迎头痛击
    北京航空学院红旗战士　沈慧源
    现在社会上刮起了一股经济主义的阴风，妄图用经济收买的手段，转移无产阶级文化大革命的大方向，对抗毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。这是资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。经济主义的鼓吹者、煽动者破坏文化大革命的罪责难逃！
    厂矿企业中一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人听着，过去，你们做官当老爷，对工人漠不关心。许多有关工人切身利益的问题，你们听而不闻，视而不见。你们那里有一点革命干部的味道？
    现在，当革命群众起来造你们反的时候，你们却一反常态，装着一副关心工人的样子，说什么“我们支持你们去造不合理制度的反”。呸！你们滥用职权，又许愿、又出钱，什么加保健费呀，什么发工作服呀，你们妄想挑动一些群众把工资级别、劳保待遇、生活福利等问题提出来，大吵大闹，企图转移斗争大方向，保护自己，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。这是资产阶级反动路线的新阴谋、新反扑。
    你们自以为高明，其实是最愚蠢的。革命造反派决不上你们的当，我们革命师生决不上你们的当。我们要毛泽东思想挂帅，要政治挂帅，决不要钞票挂帅、工作服挂帅。我们坚决打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    你们必须立即停止这种阴谋活动，向无产阶级投降，否则就没有好下场！
