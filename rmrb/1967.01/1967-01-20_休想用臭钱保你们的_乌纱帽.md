Title: Don't Think You Can Use Dirty Money to Keep Your "Official Hats"

I was originally a worker at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, and now I am a member of the Metallurgical Industry Bureau's work team. One evening, I suddenly received 496 yuan in so-called back pay. They told me that my salary would start from January of this year and be paid according to the fourth-grade worker standard.

When I received this large sum of money, I had a fierce internal struggle: "Should I take this money or not?" "If I take this money, what should I buy with it?"

At first, I thought of buying a bicycle to solve the problem of commuting to work. Later, I opened Chairman Mao's works, and Chairman Mao said: "We stand on the side of the proletariat and the people. For a Communist Party member, this means standing on the side of the Party, standing on the side of Party principles and Party policies." I thought, in doing anything, we must stand on the side of the Party and the people, only then can we be true revolutionaries. I received so much money, if I bought a bicycle, it would be convenient for me to commute to work, but what consequences would this bring to the Party and the state? If everyone did the same as me, taking the back pay to the market to buy things, wouldn't it put a lot of pressure on the state's material supply?

Then, I thought of another thing: when the revolutionary masses of the Metallurgical Industry Bureau established a revolutionary organization, they needed some funds, but the leaders in the bureau made all kinds of difficulties; now, why are they suddenly so enthusiastic about our salaries and benefits, so generous and magnanimous, giving out tens of millions and hundreds of millions? The more I thought about it, the more I felt there was a conspiracy. At present, under the powerful offensive of all the revolutionary armies in the city, the bourgeois reactionary line of the Municipal Party Committee is facing a situation of imminent collapse. A small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly carry out the bourgeois reactionary line are now making a big deal out of salaries and benefits, and are very generous with the state's money. Why? I thought and thought, and suddenly realized: originally, this small handful of bad guys are not willing to admit their defeat. In order to avoid the struggle of the masses and to keep their "official hats," they are playing new tricks. They use dirty money to bribe workers, trying to soften our fighting spirit and shift the direction of the struggle. Seeing this, I felt that I must not fall for their tricks.

Should I return the money I have received? I studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the interests of the people, making every living person feel sad when they think of them. Can we still not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our mistakes?" I thought: Revolutionary martyrs, for the happiness of all mankind, sacrificed their heads and shed their blood without hesitation. Can I not return the money I should not have taken? No! I cannot waver in the face of money. To be a true revolutionary, one must withstand the "sugar-coated bullets" and resist this perverse trend. I made up my mind not to take this money.

Now, I have decided to return all 400-plus yuan of back pay to the state. If the salary for January is given to me according to the so-called new grade standard, I will definitely return it.

I believe that this is the correct way to handle the issue of back pay. Currently, there are indeed many unreasonable salary grades and welfare systems in factories and enterprises. We should criticize and overthrow these unreasonable systems. However, in doing anything, we must use big principles to guide small principles. Now we are engaged in a life-and-death political struggle, concentrating our efforts to win this struggle is the big principle, and personal economic welfare is a small principle. Only when we workers have political liberation can we have true economic liberation. If we do not overthrow the small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and if we do not completely overthrow the bourgeois reactionary line, we will never be truly liberated. In dealing with this issue, we must not start from personal interests, but must put the "public" first, and consider the long-term and fundamental interests of the working class, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle.

Comrades who are old and young workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought! Let us unite, resolutely expose the new conspiracy played by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death! Let us complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

### 休想用臭钱保你们的“乌纱帽”

    休想用臭钱保你们的“乌纱帽”
    我本来是上海钢铁一厂的工人，现在是冶金工业局机关工作队队员。有一天晚上，我突然接到了四百九十六元的所谓补发工资。他们对我说，我的工资从今年一月份开始，按四级工的标准发给。
    当我拿到这笔巨款时，思想上起了剧烈的斗争：“该不该要这笔钱？”“拿了这笔钱，去买什么东西呢？”
    开始，我想去买一辆自行车，解决上下班的交通问题。后来，打开毛主席著作，毛主席说：“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”我就想，我们做任何事情，都要站在党和人民的立场上，这样才是一个真正的革命者。我拿到了这么多的钱，买了自行车，上下班是方便了，可是，这将给党和国家带来什么后果呢？如果大家都像我那样，拿了补发工资到市场上去购买东西，不是要给国家的物资供应增加很大的压力吗？
    接着，我又想起一件事：当初，冶金工业局的革命群众成立革命组织，需要一些经费，可是局里几个当权派百般刁难；而现在，他们对我们的工资福利为什么突然又这样热心起来，那么大方、慷慨地几十万、几百万地往外发呢？我越想越觉得这里面有阴谋。目前，在全市各路造反大军的强大攻势下，市委资产阶级反动路线已经面临土崩瓦解的局面。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人在这个时候大搞工资福利，大慷国家之慨，究竟是为什么呢？我想呀想呀，恍然大悟了：原来，这一小撮坏家伙并不甘心于自己的失败，他们为了逃避群众的斗争，保牢自己的“乌纱帽”，又在玩弄新的鬼花招了。他们用臭钱来收买工人，企图软化我们工人的斗志，转移斗争的大方向。看清了这一点，我觉得自己决不能上他们的当。
    是不是把到手的钱马上退回去？我再一次学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”我想：革命先烈为了全人类的幸福，抛头颅，洒热血，在所不惜。难道我把不应该拿的钱上缴，就舍不得了吗？不！我不能在金钱面前动摇，要做一个真正的革命者，就要经得起“糖衣炮弹”的进攻，顶得住这股歪风逆流。我下定决心，不能拿这笔钱。
    现在，我决定把四百多元补发工资全部退还给国家。一月份如果按所谓新的等级标准发给我工资，我也一定坚决退还。
    我这样来处理补发工资的问题，是完全正确的。目前在工厂企业中，确实存在着很多不合理的工资级别和福利制度，对于这些不合理的制度，我们应该批判它，打倒它。但是我们做什么事，都要用大道理来管小道理。现在我们正在进行着一场你死我活的政治斗争，集中力量搞好这场斗争是大道理，个人的经济福利问题，是个小道理。我们工人只有在政治翻身的基础上，才有真正的经济翻身。不把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派整垮，不把资产阶级反动路线彻底斗倒，我们就永远不能彻底解放。对待这个问题，决不能从个人利益出发，而必须“公”字当头，从工人阶级的长远利益和根本利益来考虑，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命老工人、青年工人们！让我们联合起来，坚决揭穿上海市委玩弄的新阴谋，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，彻底完成一斗二批三改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
