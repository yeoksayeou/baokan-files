Under the warm care and strong support of our most respected and beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai's suburbs is surging forward like a spring tide! The proletarian cultural revolution in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs is in an excellent situation, excellent indeed! With the poor and lower-middle peasants as the core, broad revolutionary rebels from the countryside are rising up from the suburbs of various counties. They are breaking through all nets and overcoming all obstacles, forming an irresistible torrent. With the momentum of sweeping away fallen leaves, they are launching a comprehensive attack on the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, as well as on the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. Although the current peasant revolutionary movement has just begun, it has already shown its strong vitality and the great spirit and invincible power of the awakened revolutionary peasants who rise up to make their own revolution and grasp the destiny of a socialist country.

Chairman Mao said, "The serious problem is educating the peasants." The rise of the peasant revolutionary movement is a great event. It shows that the proletarian cultural revolution in the Shanghai region has entered a new historical stage. On January 27, the Shanghai *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* published a reporter's commentary on this.

The reporter's commentary said: Our most respected and beloved great leader Chairman Mao, as early as forty years ago, enthusiastically praised the peasant movement: "The current rise of the peasant movement is a great issue." "This is a feat that has not been achieved in forty years or even thousands of years. This is very good. There is absolutely nothing 'bad' about it, and it is absolutely not 'very bad'." "The actions of the peasants are completely correct, and their actions are very good!" Chairman Mao most strongly supports the revolutionary rebel peasants and most firmly stands at the forefront of the peasant revolutionary movement, leading them. In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, it is under Chairman Mao's leadership that the flames of the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai's suburbs and across the country have been ignited. As soon as the suburban revolutionary peasant movement appeared, it received the warm care and strong support of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Broad revolutionary rebel peasants say: "Chairman Mao has supported us, bolstered our courage, and we are not afraid of anything. We must smash the old world to smithereens and create a radiant red world of Mao Zedong Thought!"

The commentary analyzed four characteristics of the current revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai. The commentary said: The first characteristic of the vigorous rise of the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai's suburbs is: After liberation, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants have truly risen up to liberate themselves and make their own revolution for the first time. The immense socialist enthusiasm hidden within the broad revolutionary peasant masses has burst forth like an atomic explosion.

Now, more than three million peasants from the ten counties in Shanghai's suburbs are rising up to make their revolution. Various revolutionary rebel organizations are sprouting up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, and revolutionary rebel organization flags are flying in every production brigade and team, forming a vast cultural revolution army. Of course, the rise of the peasant revolutionary movement is a earth-shaking event and could not have appeared in a calm situation. Not long ago, when the revolutionary peasants followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "Rebellion is justified" and just began to rebel, they immediately faced various suppressions and attacks from a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. These bad guys openly labeled some revolutionary rebel organizations as "counter-revolutionary" and slandered the peasant revolutionary movement as a "new tramp movement." Revolutionary peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. In the most difficult times of struggle, when the white terror clouds were thick, it was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that gave them endless strength, and they finally broke through the heavy obstacles. In a very short time, the ranks of the peasant revolutionary rebels quickly swelled. In some production brigades, the number of rebels increased from eleven to over three hundred in just three days. They broke through the various rules and regulations that shackled their hands and feet. In recent days, various counties have held grand rallies of tens of thousands of people, loudly condemning the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, loudly condemning the bourgeois reactionary line, and loudly condemning all the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed. The pioneering spirit of the revolutionary rebels has been greatly promoted, the prestige of the revolutionary rebels has been greatly enhanced, and the deeds of the revolutionary rebels have been greatly praised by the broad revolutionary masses. The revolutionary rebels, who were once cursed by those bourgeois lords as "new tramps," now enjoy the great trust of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants not only actively support the struggles of the revolutionary rebels but even turn to the revolutionary rebels to solve minor disputes like quarrels between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law or writing letters, praising the revolutionary rebel organizations as the "new peasant association." Now, the ranks of the peasant revolutionary rebels are continuing to develop and grow stronger through struggle.

The second characteristic of the vigorous rise of the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai's suburbs is: This movement has accepted the new challenge of the bourgeois reactionary line from the very beginning and has been tested and tempered in the fierce struggle against the black wind of counter-revolutionary economism, firmly holding the direction of the struggle.

When a handful of stubborn elements within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line saw that the counter-revolutionary black wind of economism they had stirred up in the urban areas was completely defeated, they blew this black wind into the countryside, attempting to make the countryside their last stronghold to make a desperate resistance. Therefore, they used every means to lead the peasant revolutionary movement onto the evil path of economism. They incited a large number of peasants to leave the countryside and put forward unreasonable economic demands. In the year-end distribution issue, they played tricks and deliberately expanded the gap between workers and peasants, inciting opposition between workers and peasants and destroying the worker-peasant alliance; they maliciously proposed the policy of "dividing everything, eating everything, and using everything," dividing up the public accumulation fund and reserve grain, attempting to undermine the foundation of the collective economy and collapse the people's communes. Some stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line in counties and communes even incited a group of peasants who were unaware of the truth to personally lead them to surge into the urban areas, engaging in economism on a large scale. These bad guys thought they could use this to shift the direction of the struggle, keep their hats, and sabotage the cultural revolution. They thought they had succeeded and could defend this stronghold. However, everything the reactionaries do always turns out to be the opposite of their wishes. Their evil plots were met with a head-on attack by the peasant revolutionary rebels.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, have a very clear understanding of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism and the correct handling of the relationships between the state, the collective, and the individual. Therefore, as soon as the black wind of economism appeared in the countryside, it was seized by the peasant revolutionary rebels. A handful of stubborn elements in the Jin Shan County Committee immediately signed an agreement to distribute over 500,000 yuan in "link-up fees," but this plot was discovered by the poor and lower-middle peasants of the New Agricultural Commune, who immediately gathered a force of over 1,500 people and rushed to the county committee to rebel. They sternly rebuked these bastards to their faces: "You eat the people's food and use the people's money. Who gave you the power to squander the blood and sweat of the working people?!" This handful of bastards were speechless and had to lower their heads and confess, immediately canceling the previous signature. After the revolutionary rebel organization of the Lou Tang Commune, An Qiao Production Brigade in Jia Ding County was established, a handful of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line actually tried to bribe the revolutionary rebel peasants with 20,000 yuan, which was immediately rejected. They said, "We revolutionary rebels don't want your stinking money! Don't try to lure us with your stinking money!" In the struggle against counter-revolutionary economism, the peasant revolutionary rebels in Shanghai's suburbs have a firm stance and clear banner. They are not bought by money and not tempted by material things. In the distribution issue, they insist on highlighting proletarian politics and correctly handle the relationship between accumulation and distribution. They have firmly held the direction of the struggle and smashed the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Many deceived masses have also awakened and turned around to launch a fierce counterattack on those stubborn elements. Under the double attack, the last stronghold that those stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line attempted to defend is crumbling. In this way, the peasant revolutionary rebels in Shanghai's suburbs have become more and more fierce and stronger in the struggle against counter-revolutionary economism and in this great revolution to criticize and repudiate private interests and establish public interests.

The third characteristic of the vigorous rise of the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai's suburbs is: The peasant revolutionary rebels have begun to implement great unity, seizing power from the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road from the bottom up, and firmly grasping the destiny of revolution and production in their own hands, thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's directive of "Grasp revolution, promote production."

The revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and other revolutionary rebel organizations in the urban areas of Shanghai have implemented great unity and great solidarity in the proletarian cultural revolution, seizing power from the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, providing valuable experience for the suburban revolutionary peasant movement. Soon after the establishment of the peasant revolutionary rebel organizations in the suburbs, they began to implement two great unities: one is the great unity among various peasant revolutionary rebel organizations; the other is the great unity between the peasant revolutionary rebel organizations and the revolutionary rebel organizations of workers, students, and cadres. With these two great unities, many peasant revolutionary rebel organizations in communes and production brigades have quickly and decisively launched the struggle to seize power from the bottom up in the struggle to thoroughly expose and criticize the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as in the struggle to counter the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. They deeply understand that to carry the proletarian cultural revolution in the countryside to the end and to thoroughly uproot the poisonous roots of capitalist restoration in the countryside, they must firmly grasp the political, economic, and cultural power in the hands of the peasant revolutionary rebels. The poor and lower-middle peasants said well: "With the power in our hands, we have everything, and we are not afraid of the class enemies playing any 'settling of accounts after the autumn harvest'!"

In the places where the peasant revolutionary rebels have seized power, a new situation has emerged in revolution and production. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants have been completely liberated from the deep-rooted rule of the bourgeois reactionary line for more than a decade, truly grasping their own destiny and becoming the masters of the state. Their wisdom and talents have been fully developed. The peasant revolutionary rebels of the Yuan Jia Commune in Chuan Sha County seized power and established the "Grasp revolution, promote production committee," which promoted the in-depth development of the cultural revolution movement throughout the commune, pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and strengthened the management of vegetable production and livestock breeding, achieving great results. In many communes and brigades that have seized power, revolution and production have generally shown a thriving new situation. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants said: "Only by seizing the leadership from the hands of the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road and firmly grasping it in the hands of the revolutionary rebels can we truly and thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's directive of 'Grasp revolution, promote production'." Countless facts prove that the peasant revolutionary rebels and revolutionary peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be able to shoulder the two burdens of revolution and production well, carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, and build our socialist motherland into an iron fortress.

The fourth characteristic of the vigorous rise of the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai's suburbs is: This movement has received strong support from the revolutionary rebel organizations of workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres; the revolutionary peasant movement has quickly merged with the revolutionary worker and student movements.

The main support from the revolutionary rebel organizations such as the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters for the suburban revolutionary peasant movement is reflected in the following three aspects: First, the advanced Shanghai working class has shown their revolutionary spirit and wisdom of daring to think, dare to speak, dare to make revolution, dare to rebel, and dare to seize power in the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, setting an example and providing experience for the revolutionary peasants. Second, at the critical moment of smashing economism and thoroughly crushing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 27 other revolutionary rebel organizations timely issued the second "Open Letter to the People of the Whole Shanghai City," fully supporting the struggle of the suburban peasant revolutionary rebels against the black wind of counter-revolutionary economism, becoming a strong backing for the suburban revolutionary peasant movement, and playing a great role in promoting the rapid development of the revolutionary peasant movement. Third, revolutionary students have gone to the countryside in large numbers, going to the peasant revolutionary rebels, enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and Mao Zedong Thought to the broad revolutionary peasants, exchanging experiences of the proletarian cultural revolution. The going-to-the-countryside movement of revolutionary students has promoted the development of the revolutionary peasant movement and also taken a new step in realizing their own ideological transformation.

Now, under the great revolutionary situation, the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai's suburbs is advancing victoriously along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line with an irresistible momentum!

    在最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和热情支持下
　　上海郊区革命农民运动势如春潮澎湃
　　《文汇报》《解放日报》发表记者述评
    新华社上海二十九日电　上海郊区农村无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，好得很！在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和热情支持下，上海郊区革命农民运动如同春潮澎湃，滚滚向前！以贫下中农为核心的广大革命造反派农民，纷纷从市郊各县起来，他们冲决一切罗网，冲破各种阻力，汇成一股不可抗拒的洪流，以横扫落叶之势，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，向没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，发起了全面攻击。尽管当前革命农民运动刚刚兴起，但一开始就显示了它的强大生命力，显示了觉醒了的革命农民自己起来闹革命，自己起来掌握社会主义国家命运的伟大的气概和无敌的力量。
    毛主席说：“严重的问题是教育农民。”革命农民运动的兴起是件了不起的大事。它表明：上海地区的无产阶级文化大革命开始进入了一个新的历史阶段。二十七日，上海《文汇报》《解放日报》为此发表了记者述评。
    记者述评说：我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席早在四十年前就热情洋溢地歌颂过农民运动：“目前农民运动的兴起是一个极大的问题。”“这是四十年乃至几千年未曾成就过的奇勋。这是好得很。完全没有什么‘糟’，完全不是什么‘糟得很’。”“农民的举动，完全是对的，他们的举动好得很！”毛主席最最支持农民革命造反派，最最坚定地站在革命农民运动的前头领导他们。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，又是在毛主席领导下点燃起上海郊区和全国革命农民运动的熊熊烈火。郊区革命农民运动一出现，就得到了毛主席和党中央的亲切关怀和热情支持。广大革命造反派农民说：“毛主席撑了我们的腰，壮了我们的胆，我们什么都不怕。我们一定要把旧世界砸个稀巴烂，创造出一个光芒万丈的红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新世界！”
    述评分析了当前上海革命农民运动的四个特点。述评说：上海郊区革命农民运动蓬勃兴起的第一个特点是：广大贫下中农解放以后第一次真正自己起来解放自己，自己起来闹革命，蕴藏在广大革命农民群众中的极大的社会主义积极性，像原子弹爆炸一样地迸发出来。
    现在，上海郊区十县三百多万农民纷纷起来闹革命，各种革命造反组织如雨后春笋，社社队队飘扬着革命造反组织的战旗，已经开始形成一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。当然，革命农民运动的兴起是一件惊天动地的大事，不可能在风平浪静的情况下出现的。不久前，当革命农民遵照毛主席“造反有理”的教导，刚刚起来造反的时候，就遭到了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的种种压制和打击。这些坏家伙，公然把一些革命造反组织打成“反革命”，把革命农民运动污蔑为“新二流子运动”。革命农民最听毛主席的话，在斗争最艰苦的时候，在白色恐怖阴云密布的时候，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了他们无穷无尽的力量，终于从重重阻力中杀了出来。在极短的时间内，农民革命造反派的队伍迅速壮大了，有的生产大队在三天之内就从十一个人骤增到三百多人。他们冲破了束缚手脚的种种条条框框。连日来，各县纷纷举行声势浩大的万人大会，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，大造一切没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右的反。革命造反派的革命首创精神得到大发扬，革命造反派的声威大振，革命造反派的所作所为得到广大革命群众的大称赞。过去被那些资产阶级老爷们咒骂为“新二流子”的革命造反派，现在却得到了广大贫下中农的极大信任。广大贫下中农不但积极支持革命造反派的斗争，甚至连婆媳吵架、代写书信之类的事，也要找革命造反派解决，群众称誉革命造反组织为“新农会”。现在，农民革命造反派的队伍正在斗争中继续发展、壮大。
    上海郊区革命农民运动蓬勃兴起的第二个特点是：这个运动一开始就接受了资产阶级反动路线的新挑战，在和反革命经济主义黑风的激烈搏斗中经受了考验，坚持了斗争的大方向。
    上海市委一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，眼看自己一手挑起的反革命的经济主义黑风在市区遭到彻底破产的时候，又把这股黑风刮到了农村，妄想把农村作为最后的一个堡垒，负隅顽抗。因此，他们千方百计地把革命农民运动引到经济主义的邪道上去。他们煽动大批农民离开农村，提出不合理的经济要求。他们在年终分配问题上，大耍阴谋，蓄意扩大工农差别，煽动工人和农民的对立，破坏工农联盟；他们恶毒地提出“分光、吃光、用光”的政策，分掉公积金和储备粮，妄想挖掉集体经济的墙脚，搞垮人民公社。有的县、社顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的混蛋甚至煽动一批不明真相的农民，亲自带着他们涌向市区，大搞经济主义。这些坏蛋想以此来转移斗争的大方向，保住自己的乌纱帽，破坏文化大革命，他们自以为得计，可以固守这个堡垒了。可是，反动派所干的一切，总是走向它的愿望的反面。他们的罪恶阴谋，遭到农民革命造反派的迎头痛击。
    广大贫下中农经过活学活用毛主席著作，对于社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，对于正确处理国家、集体、个人三者关系等大是大非问题，都有极其明确的认识。所以，经济主义的妖风在农村一露头，就被农民革命造反派揪住了。金山县委内一小撮顽固的家伙一下子签字同意发放五十多万元的“串连费”，这个阴谋被新农公社的贫下中农知道了，立刻集结了一支一千五百多人的队伍，赶到县委造反，他们义正词严地当面痛斥这些混蛋：“你们吃人民的饭，用人民的钱，是谁给你们这样大的权力，挥霍我们劳动人民的血汗？！”这一小撮混蛋哑口无言，被迫低头认罪，当场取消原来的签字。嘉定县娄塘公社庵桥生产大队的农民革命造反组织成立以后，一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子竟用二千元的巨款来收买革命造反派农民，当场被驳回，他们说：“我们造反派不要你们的臭钱！不许你们用臭钱来引诱我们！”上海郊区的农民革命造反派在同反革命经济主义的斗争中立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，他们不为金钱所收买，不为物质所引诱，在分配问题上坚持突出无产阶级政治，正确处理了积累和分配的关系。他们坚持了斗争的大方向，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。一些受蒙蔽的群众也纷纷觉悟过来，回过头来向那些顽固的家伙猛烈反击。在两面夹攻之下，那些顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人所妄图固守的最后一个堡垒处于土崩瓦解之中。就是这样，上海郊区的农民革命造反派在反击反革命经济主义的斗争中，在这场破私立公的大革命中，越战越勇，越战越强。
    上海郊区革命农民运动蓬勃兴起的第三个特点是：农民革命造反派开始实行大联合，自下而上地，全面地夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，把革命和生产的命运紧紧掌握在自己手里，不折不扣地贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。
    上海市区的革命工人、革命学生、革命干部等革命造反派在无产阶级文化大革命中实行了大联合、大团结，向走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，为郊区革命农民运动提供了宝贵的经验。郊区农民革命造反组织建立不久，就开始实行两个大联合：一是各农民革命造反组织之间的大联合；一是农民革命造反组织和工人、学生、机关干部等革命造反团体之间的大联合。有了这两个大联合，不少公社、大队的农民革命造反组织，就在彻底揭发批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，以及在反击资产阶级反动路线新反扑的斗争中，迅速地果断地展开了自下而上的夺权斗争。他们深深懂得：要把农村的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，要彻底铲除农村资本主义复辟的毒根，就一定要把农村的政治、经济、文化大权牢牢地掌握在农民革命造反派手里。贫下中农说得好：“有了印把子，就有了我们贫下中农的一切，就不怕阶级敌人搞什么‘秋后算账’！”
    在农民革命造反派夺了权的地方，那里的革命和生产出现了一个崭新的局面。广大贫下中农从资产阶级反动路线十多年来根深蒂固的统治下彻底解放出来，真正掌握了自己的命运，做了国家的主人，他们的智慧和才能得到了最充分的发挥。川沙县严桥公社的农民革命造反派夺了权，成立了“抓革命，促生产委员会”，使整个公社的文化革命运动得到了深入开展，使活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段，并加强了蔬菜生产和牲畜饲养的管理，取得了很大的成绩。许多夺了权的社、队，革命和生产普遍出现蓬勃高涨的新气象。广大贫下中农说：“只有把领导权从走资本主义道路的当权派的手里夺过来，牢牢地掌握在革命造反派的手里，才能真正地不折不扣地执行毛主席提出的‘抓革命，促生产’的指示。”无数事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的农民革命造反派和革命农民，一定能够很好地挑起革命和生产两副担子，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义祖国建设成为铁打江山。
    上海郊区革命农民运动蓬勃兴起的第四个特点是：这个运动得到了工人、革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部等革命造反组织的大力支持；革命的农民运动迅速地和革命的工人运动、学生运动结合在一起。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命造反团体给予郊区革命农民运动的支持主要表现在以下三个方面：第一、先进的上海工人阶级在向上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的斗争中，表现了他们敢想、敢说、敢革命、敢造反、敢夺权的革命气概和革命智慧，为革命农民作出了榜样，提供了经验。第二、在打倒经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的关键时刻，上海工人革命造反总司令部等二十七个革命造反团体及时地发出了第二个《告上海全市人民书》，全力支持了郊区农民革命造反派反击反革命经济主义黑风的斗争，作了郊区革命农民运动强大的后盾，对革命农民运动的迅猛发展起了巨大的推动作用。第三、革命学生纷纷到农村去，到农民革命造反派中去，热情地向广大革命农民宣传毛主席的革命路线，宣传毛泽东思想，交流无产阶级文化大革命的经验。革命学生的下乡，对革命农民运动的发展起了促进作用，也为实现自己的思想革命化迈出了新的一步。
    现在，上海郊区的革命农民运动在大好革命形势之下，正以排山倒海之势，沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进！
