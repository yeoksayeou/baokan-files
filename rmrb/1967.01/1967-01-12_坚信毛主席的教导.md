A Cuban youth in his twenties met a Chinese comrade at an exhibition. The Chinese comrade offered him a Chinese cigarette. As he smoked the Chinese cigarette, he enthusiastically said, "I have visited China. I saw Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square." He recounted his impressions of visiting China and sighed, "Smoking a Chinese cigarette makes me recall many unforgettable and moving experiences in China." As he bid farewell to the Chinese comrade, he lowered his voice and whispered in the Chinese comrade's ear, "Chairman Mao said it well: Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Please believe me, I firmly believe in this famous saying."

    坚信毛主席的教导
    一位二十多岁的古巴青年在一个展览会上碰见一位中国同志，中国同志请他吸一支中国香烟。他抽着中国香烟，热情地说：“我访问过中国，我在天安门广场上见过毛主席。”他叙述了访问中国的观感，感慨地说：“抽一支中国香烟，使我回忆起在中国经历的许多难忘的动人的往事。”当他向中国同志告别的时候，他放低声音在中国同志的耳边说：“毛主席说得好：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。请你相信，我对这句名言坚信不移。”
