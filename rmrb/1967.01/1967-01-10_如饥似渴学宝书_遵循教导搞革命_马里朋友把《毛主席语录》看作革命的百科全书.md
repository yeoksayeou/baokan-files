The French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" has been enthusiastically received by friends in Mali.

A Malian friend, upon seeing the news about the publication of the French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in "Beijing Weekly," immediately called the Xinhua News Agency reporter to request a copy, emphasizing, "Please don't forget me, I must have one." When he received "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he joyfully said, "I am so lucky, I got a book from the Red Guards."

A Chinese expert working in a factory in Mali always carries a French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with him. When the workers and technicians in the factory saw this book, many gathered around, all wanting to see it. However, there was only one copy. What to do? After a discussion, they reached an agreement: everyone would take turns copying the quotations into their own notebooks. One day, it was the turn of a technician named Musa Kuayate. He took the book home to copy the quotations that night. His father happened to see the book and immediately started reading it. That night, the old man read fifty pages in one go. The next day, the old man still did not want to return the book to his son. His son explained to him that they should follow the agreement, and only then did the old man reluctantly return the book to his son.

Two technicians in another factory had been longing for "Quotations from Chairman Mao" for a long time but couldn't find it. Finally, they found a way to study it. They prepared special notebooks and every morning copied down each quotation published in the Xinhua News Agency's news releases.

A Malian friend who had visited China said after receiving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "This is the encyclopedia of revolution." He then recited the following quotation: "All the people of the world should have courage, dare to fight, not fear difficulties, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed." He said, "All the people of the world should follow Chairman Mao's instructions."

Another Malian friend who had visited China also loved reading Chairman Mao's works and could recite many of his quotations. When he received a French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he happily said, "I am Chairman Mao's little student. This book provides convenient conditions for me to study Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought is a universal truth. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, people only need to follow Chairman Mao's instructions to avoid making mistakes and carry out the revolution well."

    如饥似渴学宝书　遵循教导搞革命
    马里朋友把《毛主席语录》看作革命的百科全书
    新华社巴马科电　法文版的《毛主席语录》受到马里朋友的热烈欢迎。
    一位马里朋友在《北京周报》上看到关于出版法文版《毛主席语录》的消息时，立刻打电话向新华社记者要，他特别强调说：“请别把我忘了，必须给我一本。”当他收到《毛主席语录》时，他十分高兴地说：“我运气真好，我得到了一本红卫兵的书。”
    在马里一家工厂工作的一位中国专家随身带着一本法文版《毛主席语录》，当这本书被马里工人和技术人员看到时，许多人围上了，大家都想要，但是只有一本，怎么办？经过一番讨论之后，达成了一项协议，就是大家轮流把语录抄在自己的本子上。一天，轮到一位名叫穆萨·库亚特的技术人员了，他把书带回家准备晚上抄写。刚好被他父亲看到了，他父亲也非常热爱毛主席的书，拿过去马上读了起来。当天晚上，这位老人一口气就读了五十页。第二天，老人还不肯把这本书还给他儿子，他儿子跟他解释说，应该遵守协议，他才不得不十分惋惜地把书还给了他的儿子。
    另一家工厂的两位马里技术人员，好久都没有找到他们日夜想望的《毛主席语录》。最后他们找到了一个学习《毛主席语录》的办法。他们准备了专门的本子，每天早上把刊登在新华社新闻稿上的每一条语录抄下来。
    一位访问过中国的马里朋友在得到一本《毛主席语录》后说：“这是革命的百科全书”。他接着念了如下一条语录：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”并且说：全世界人民都要遵循毛主席的这个教导。
    另一位访问过中国的马里朋友，也很爱读毛主席著作，他能背诵很多条毛主席语录。当他得到了一本法文版的《毛主席语录》时，他高兴地说：“我是毛主席的小学生，这本书为我学习毛主席著作提供了便利条件。毛泽东思想是普遍真理。在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，人们只要遵循毛主席的教导，就能避免犯错误，搞好革命。”
