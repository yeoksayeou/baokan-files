The Albanian newspaper "Unity" commented on January 13th on the agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to promote the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" and pointed out that this is a new link in the U.S.-Soviet plan to jointly dominate the world.

The commentary said that the purpose of signing the Non-Proliferation Treaty is to maintain the so-called "super-nuclear" status of the two major powers, in order to intimidate and blackmail the peoples of various countries, and to infringe upon the independence and sovereignty of various countries.

The commentary pointed out that the treacherous behavior of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist clique is not accidental. It is the inevitable result of the betrayal line actively pursued by the Soviet leaders in signing the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the United States and Britain a few years ago. These shameful betrayers of socialism and communism have sacrificed the vital interests of the Soviet people and the revolutionary people of the whole world, making one concession after another to U.S. imperialism.

The commentary said that the agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to promote the so-called "Non-Proliferation Treaty" was reached only after the Khrushchev revisionists made major concessions. The Soviet Khrushchev revisionists openly agreed to West Germany's involvement in nuclear weapons within the so-called North Atlantic Treaty Organization nuclear planning committee.

The commentary said that the peoples of Europe, who have suffered from German Nazi aggression, especially the Soviet people, will never forgive these traitors for this treacherous act that endangers European and world peace.

The commentary pointed out that the U.S.-Soviet collusion on the nuclear issue is also an important part of their plan to oppose the People's Republic of China. The imperialists and revisionists are eager to sign a non-proliferation treaty as soon as possible to obstruct the rapid development of China's nuclear weapons and to strengthen the so-called ring of fire around China.

The commentary said that the revolutionary people of the whole world condemn the new betrayal of the Soviet Khrushchev clique and warmly welcome the great progress made by the People's Republic of China in the development of nuclear weapons. They believe that the faster the people of China develop nuclear weapons, the sooner the day will come to destroy and prohibit these weapons.

    阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》揭露美苏加紧核勾结
    世界人民决不饶恕苏修的叛徒行为
    新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十三日就美苏达成鼓吹缔结所谓“防止核武器扩散条约”的协议发表评论指出，这是美苏妄图联合主宰世界计划的新的一环。
    评论说，缔结防止核武器扩散条约的目的在于保持两个所谓“超核”大国的核“优势”，以便对各国人民进行恫吓和讹诈，侵害各国的独立和主权。
    评论指出，苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的这一叛徒行为并不是偶然的。它是苏联领导人积极推行几年前赫鲁晓夫同美国和英国签订的部分禁止核试验条约的叛变路线的必然结果。这些社会主义和共产主义事业的可耻的叛徒牺牲了苏联人民和全世界革命人民的切身利益，对美帝国主义作出了一个又一个的妥协。
    评论说，美苏达成鼓吹缔结所谓“防止核武器扩散条约”的协议也是在赫鲁晓夫修正主义者作了重大让步以后才达成的。苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者公然同意西德在所谓北大西洋公约组织核计划委员会内染指核武器。
    评论说，遭受过德国纳粹侵害的欧洲各国人民，首先是苏联人民永远不会饶恕这些叛徒这一危害欧洲和世界和平的叛变行为。
    评论指出，美苏在核问题上的勾结也是它们反对中华人民共和国计划的重要一环。帝国主义和修正主义者妄图尽早签订一项防止核扩散条约来阻止中国核武器的迅速发展，并且加强在中国周围建立所谓火力包围圈。
    评论说，全世界革命人民谴责苏联赫鲁晓夫集团新的叛变行为，热烈欢呼中华人民共和国在发展核武器方面的巨大进步。他们相信，人民中国发展核武器愈快，最后销毁和禁止这些武器的日子也将愈快地到来。
