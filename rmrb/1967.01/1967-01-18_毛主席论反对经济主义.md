Politics is the commander, the soul.
Political work is the lifeline of all economic work.
Without a correct political viewpoint, it is as if one has no soul.
*From "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 2, page 348.*

Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. In periods of fundamental change in the social economic system, this is especially true.
*From the annotation to "Serious Lessons." The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside, Volume 1, page 123.*

Revolutionary ideological struggles and artistic struggles must be subordinate to political struggles, because only through politics can the needs of classes and the masses be concentratedly expressed.
*From "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 3, page 868.*

We must strive to engage in political struggles. Without political reform, all productive forces will be destroyed.
Currently, we should lead the peasants to strive in political struggles to thoroughly overthrow the power of the landlords. And immediately begin economic struggles to fundamentally solve the problems of land and other economic issues for the poor peasants.
*From "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 1, page 34.*

After the peasants have organized, their first action is to politically bring down the prestige of the landlord class, especially the local tyrants and evil gentry, that is, to bring down the power of the landlords from their social position in the countryside and raise up the power of the peasants. This is a very serious and crucial struggle. This struggle is the central struggle of the second period, the revolutionary period. Without victory in this struggle, all struggles for rent reduction, interest reduction, land demands, and other means of production will have no chance of victory.
*From "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 1, page 25.*

In these struggles, various mass organizations should be organized, the party's core should be established, the masses' armed forces and the people's political power should be established, and the masses' struggles should be quickly raised from economic struggles to political struggles to participate in the construction of the base areas.
*From "Establishing a Firm Base in Northeast China." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 4, page 1178.*

Without political reform, all productive forces will be destroyed, both in agriculture and in industry.
*From "On Coalition Government." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 3, page 1080.*

It is absolutely not permissible to see only the immediate, partial benefits and forget the long-term interests of the working class.
We should educate the trade union comrades and the workers to understand that it is absolutely not permissible to see only the immediate, partial benefits and forget the long-term interests of the working class.
*From "On Industrial and Commercial Policy." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 4, page 1283.*

It should be acknowledged that the masses often pay more attention to immediate, partial, and individual interests, and do not understand or do not fully understand long-term, national, and collective interests. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly conduct lively and practical political education among the masses, and it is also necessary to constantly explain the difficulties that arise to them truthfully and study with them how to solve these difficulties.
*From "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 2, pages 357-358.*

At the beginning of entering the city, do not easily raise the slogans of increasing wages and reducing working hours. During the war, being able to continue production, not reducing working hours, and maintaining the original wage level is a good thing. Whether to appropriately reduce working hours and increase wages in the future should be decided based on the economic situation, that is, whether the enterprise is developing upwards.
*From "Telegram to the Front Command of Luo Yang after Re-capturing Luo Yang." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 4, page 1324.*

Be vigilant against the attack of "sugar-coated bullets."
There may be some communists who have not been defeated by armed enemies; they are heroes in front of these enemies. But they cannot withstand the attack of bullets coated with sugar; they will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation.
*From "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China." Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 4, page 1439.*

Editor's Note: Currently, a small clique within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and a small number of stubborn elements who insist on the reactionary bourgeois line, are colluding with the ghosts and monsters in society to use economism to corrupt the masses, disrupt production, disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and disrupt the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Economism leads people astray, making them only care about immediate, partial benefits and abandon the fundamental interests of the proletariat. It is anti-Marxism-Leninism, anti-Mao Zedong Thought, and a thorough and complete revisionist product.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long since thoroughly criticized economism. To help comrades recognize the reactionary nature of economism, we have compiled some of Chairman Mao's statements on criticizing economism for the readers to study.

    毛主席论反对经济主义
    政治是统帅，是灵魂。
    政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线
    没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。
    《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。《毛泽东著作选读》甲种本，第三四八页。
    政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。
                  《严重的教训》一文按语。《中国农村的社会主义高潮》上册，第一二三页。
    革命的思想斗争和艺术斗争，必须服从于政治的斗争，因为只有经过政治，阶级和群众的需要才能集中地表现出来。
                  《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。《毛泽东选集》第三卷，第八六八页。
    应该极力做政治斗争。政治不改革，一切生产力都遭到破坏的命运
    目前我们对农民应该领导他们极力做政治斗争，期于彻底推翻地主权力。并随即开始经济斗争，期于根本解决贫农的土地及其他经济问题。
                  《湖南农民运动考察报告》。《毛泽东选集》第一卷，第三四页。
    农民有了组织之后，第一个行动，便是从政治上把地主阶级特别是土豪劣绅的威风打下去，即是从农村的社会地位上把地主权力打下去，把农民权力长上来。这是一个极严重极紧要的斗争。这个斗争是第二时期即革命时期的中心斗争。这个斗争不胜利，一切减租减息，要求土地及其他生产手段等等的经济斗争，决无胜利之可能。
                  《湖南农民运动考察报告》。《毛泽东选集》第一卷，第二五页。
    应当在这些斗争中，组织各种群众团体，建立党的核心，建立群众的武装和人民的政权，把群众斗争从经济斗争迅速提高到政治斗争，参加根据地的建设。
                  《建立巩固的东北根据地》。《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第一一七八页。
    政治不改革，一切生产力都遭到破坏的命运，农业如此，工业也是如此。
             《论联合政府》。《毛泽东选集》第三卷，第一○八○页。
    决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益
    应当向工会同志和工人群众进行教育，使他们懂得，决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益。
      《关于工商业政策》。《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第一二八三页。
    应该承认：有些群众往往容易注意当前的、局部的、个人的利益，而不了解或者不很了解长远的、全国性的、集体的利益。……因此，需要在群众中间经常进行生动的、切实的政治教育，并且应当经常把发生的困难向他们作真实的说明，和他们一起研究如何解决困难的办法。
                  《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。
                 《毛泽东著作选读》甲种本，第三五七——三五八页。
    入城之初，不要轻易提出增加工资减少工时的口号。在战争时期，能够继续生产，能够不减工时，维持原有工资水平，就是好事。将来是否酌量减少工时增加工资，要依据经济情况即企业是否向上发展来决定。
                  《再克洛阳后给洛阳前线指挥部的电报》。
                    《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第一三二四页。
    警惕“糖衣炮弹”的攻击
    可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。
    《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》。《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第一四三九页。
    《光明日报》编者按：当前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神，用经济主义来腐蚀群众，破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏无产阶级专政。
    经济主义把人们引向邪路，使人们只顾眼前的片面的福利，而丢掉无产阶级的根本利益。它是反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的，是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义的货色。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，早就对经济主义作了彻底的批判。为了帮助同志们认清经济主义的反动本质，我们摘编了毛主席有关批判经济主义的一些论述，供读者学习。
                              （原载一月十七日《光明日报》）
