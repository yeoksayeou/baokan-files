The militia of Hengling Brigade in Fangshan People's Commune, Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, have been repeatedly studying and applying "The Three Articles" to break private interests and establish public ones, transforming their worldview, and advancing on the path of ideological revolution. Recently, the brigade held a meeting to share experiences on studying and applying "The Three Articles." Below are the speeches of several militia members at this meeting.

	**Putting Others' Interests Above One's Own**

	Militia medical soldier Ding Lvxiang said: One night, poor peasant member Liu Baowen came knocking on my door, saying his wife Ma Lanying had severe stomach pain and asked me to come and take a look. Coincidentally, I was not feeling well that day. Should I go or not? If I don't go, they came to my door for help, and it would be awkward to refuse; if I go, I might worsen my own condition. As soon as this thought arose, I immediately recalled a passage from Chairman Mao's article "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Our whole army must be imbued with a spirit of selflessness. Everyone who joins our army must be ready to lay down his life for the people. Our whole army must be ready to lay down its lives for the people." Comparing this with Chairman Mao's instructions, I realized that I was more concerned about myself than others, far from the requirements of "completely" and "thoroughly." I thought, to completely and thoroughly serve the people, one must overcome the "self." With this in mind, I quickly got out of bed and went to Liu Baowen's house to treat the patient. This time, I cured Ma Lanying's stomach pain with medicine, and Chairman Mao's words also cured my selfishness.

	**Eliminating Selfish Thoughts to Help Others Break Private Interests and Establish Public Ones**

	Militia platoon leader Zhang Yuhuai said: Once, a party branch committee member had a grievance over work points and was in a bad mood. I felt he was thinking for himself and should be criticized to help him correct his mistake. But the words were on the tip of my tongue and then swallowed back. Because he was a party branch committee member and had said he would recommend me for party membership, if I criticized him, he might take offense, and that would be asking for trouble. What should I do about this matter? I took this question to study "The Three Articles." Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." He and this committee member are part of the revolutionary ranks; if he has shortcomings, I should prioritize revolutionary interests and point them out to help him progress. I feared not being able to join the party and dared not speak up; this was the "self" at work. I thought, to help him overcome the "self," I must first fight against the "self" in my own mind. After struggling with myself, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions, mustered my courage, and had a heart-to-heart talk with him. The first time didn't work out, but I didn't lose heart. The second time I talked to him, we first studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" together. We reminisced about hardships and joys. After he studied Chairman Mao's teachings, he realized he should uphold what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, and thus publicly made a self-criticism to the masses. Now he not only has no grudge against me but has become even closer to me.

	**Revolutionaries Should Not Fear Risks**

	Militia deputy platoon leader Ding Waneng said: One afternoon, the weather suddenly turned gloomy, and a gust of wind blew off the thatch on the production team's warehouse roof. Seeing that collective property was about to be damaged, I was anxious and rushed over with a few militia members. Upon arrival, I saw the house shaking, ready to collapse at any moment. If I climbed up, the house might collapse, and even if I didn't die, I would be injured. What should I do? When I was hesitating, Chairman Mao's teachings echoed in my ears: "To fight means to sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the majority of the people's suffering. To die for the people is weightier than Mount Tai."

	Chairman Mao's teachings gave me great encouragement. I and a few other militia members rushed onto the roof and used our bodies to press down the thatch that was about to be blown off. I had only one thought in my mind: no matter the danger, I must protect the collective property. Later, the commune members also rushed over, and after a tense struggle, we saved the warehouse, and the more than three thousand catties of grain inside were not damaged. Someone asked me where my courage came from, and I replied that it was from "The Three Articles."

	**All Difficulties Are Paper Tigers**

	Militia member Xu Gongfa said: Two winters ago, the production team leader asked me to lead more than ten militia members to urgently repair a thirty-meter-long drainage ditch in two days. The ditch had more than a foot of water, and we had to pump it dry before digging. At that time, it was very cold, and water froze into ice. I went to the site and saw that the ditch was covered with a thick layer of ice, and my heart turned cold. As usual, when I encountered difficulties, I first sought guidance from "The Three Articles." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory." Chairman Mao's words were like a fiery red sun, warming my heart. I gathered the militia members and studied this passage. Everyone said, we militia are a shock team fighting against nature, and countless revolutionary forerunners were not afraid of death, so why should we fear this little difficulty!

	I and the core militia member Wang Changhua rolled up our pants, entered the ditch to break the ice and pump out the water, while other militia members dug and carried. No matter how cold the weather was, it could not cool our fiery hearts, and no matter how hard the frozen soil was, it could not withstand our sky-high enthusiasm. In this way, the two-day task was completed in a day and a half. Through this experience of digging the drainage ditch, I deeply felt that in the face of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, no matter how big the difficulty is, it is all a paper tiger.

### 在破私立公上狠下功夫——记横岭大队民兵一次活学活用“老三篇”讲用会

    在破私立公上狠下功夫
    ——记横岭大队民兵一次活学活用“老三篇”讲用会
    江苏省江宁县方山公社横岭大队的民兵，反复活学活用“老三篇”，破私立公，改造世界观，在思想革命化的大道上阔步前进。最近，这个大队的民兵开了一次活学活用“老三篇”的讲用会。下面是几位民兵在这次会上的发言。
    关心别人应比关心自己为重
    民兵卫生兵丁绿香说：一天深夜，贫农社员刘宝文来叫门，说他爱人马兰英肚子痛得厉害，叫我去看看。正巧，这天我的身体不舒服。去不去呢？不去吧，人家有病请上门来了，不好意思推辞；去吧，我又不舒服，担心搞坏了身体。刚产生这个念头，我立刻想到毛主席在《为人民服务》这篇文章中说的一段话：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”用毛主席的指示一对照，觉察到我是关心自己比关心他人为重，离“完全”“彻底”的要求太远了。我想，要做到完全彻底为人民服务，就必须斗倒“我”字。想到这里，我一骨碌从床上爬了起来，到刘宝文家给病人看了病。这次，我用药治好了马兰英的肚子痛，而毛主席的话也治了我的私心病。
    去掉私心杂念才能帮助别人破私立公
    民兵排长张宇怀说：一次，有一个党支部委员为劳动工分问题闹情绪，我觉得这是他在为自己打算，应该对他提出批评，帮他改正错误。但是话到嘴边又咽了下去。因为他是党支部委员，曾说要介绍我入党，我对他提意见，能接受还好，要是翻了脸，那不是自找麻烦吗？这件事到底应该怎么办？我带着这个问题学习“老三篇”。毛主席教导我们：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”我和这个支委是一个革命队伍的人，他有缺点，我应该以革命利益为重，向他提出来，帮助他进步。我怕入不了党，有意见也不敢提，这是“我”字在作怪。我想，要帮他斗“我”字，得先和自己脑子里的“我”字斗。经过自我斗争后，我就按毛主席的指示，鼓起勇气同他谈心，第一次没有谈得拢，我也没有灰心。第二次找他谈心时，首先和他一起学习《为人民服务》。一起忆苦思甜。当他学习了毛主席的教导以后，认识到应当为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，于是，就公开向群众作了检讨。现在他不但对我没意见，而且和我更加亲近了。
    干革命不要怕风险
    民兵副排长丁万能说：一天下午，天气突然转阴，一阵狂风把生产队仓库屋顶上的草掀起来了。眼看集体财产就要遭到损失，我心急如火，和几个民兵急忙跑去。到那儿一看，房子在摇动，随时都有倒塌的危险。这时，如果爬上屋去，房子倒了，就是摔不死也要被摔伤。怎么办？当我正在犹豫不决的时候，毛主席的教导响在耳边：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”
    毛主席的教导给了我巨大的鼓舞。我和另外几个民兵冲上了屋顶，用身体压住了快要掀掉的草。我心里只有一个念头：不管有什么危险，一定要保住集体财产。后来，社员们也赶来了，经过一场紧张的搏斗，终于保住了仓库，屋里的三千多斤粮食没有遭到损失。事后有人问我胆量是从那里来的，我回答是“老三篇”给的。
    一切困难都是纸老虎
    民兵许公法说：前年冬天，生产队长叫我带领十几个民兵，在两天内突击修好一条三十多米长的排水沟。沟里有一尺多深的水，先得把水戽干才能挖土。当时天气很冷，滴水成冰。我到工地一看，沟里结了厚厚的一层冰，心里就凉了大半截子。这次我和往常一样，碰到困难首先向“老三篇”请教。毛主席教导我们说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的话像一轮火红火红的红太阳，照得我心里热乎乎的。我就把民兵召集起来，学习这条语录。大家说，我们民兵是战天斗地的突击队，成千上万的革命先烈连死都不怕，我们还怕这点困难！
    我和基干民兵王昌华卷起裤管，下沟破冰戽水，其他民兵挖的挖，抬的抬。不管天气怎么冷，也冷不了我们火热的心，不管冻土怎么硬，也硬不过我们冲天的干劲。就这样，两天的任务，一天半就完成了。经过这次挖排水沟锻炼，我更深刻地体会到，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的人面前，再大的困难也统统是纸老虎。（据新华社南京六日电）
