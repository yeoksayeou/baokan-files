Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Denounces U.S. "Peace Offensive" as War Escalation

British Proposal Completely Serves U.S. Aggressors

U.S. Must Stop Aggression and Withdraw All Troops from South Vietnam

	Hanoi, January 4 (Xinhua) - The spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 3, exposing that British Foreign Secretary George Brown's recent so-called "peace talks proposal" is entirely in the service of U.S. aggressors.

	The statement reaffirmed, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always believed that the U.S. is the aggressor. The U.S. must stop its aggression, withdraw all U.S. troops and mercenaries from South Vietnam, halt all acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and allow the Vietnamese people to resolve their own affairs. Only then will peace be immediately restored."

	The statement listed U.S. acts of aggression, such as sending expeditionary forces to South Vietnam and bombing North Vietnam, and pointed out that the U.S. is the aggressor and the Vietnamese people are the victims. However, Brown equates the aggressor with the victim, calling on all parties to immediately sit down and discuss a ceasefire without demanding that the U.S. stop its aggression, withdraw its troops from South Vietnam, and unconditionally and permanently halt its bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It is clear that Brown is standing on the side of the U.S. aggressors, opposing the Vietnamese people.

	The statement pointed out that Brown's proposal does not mention the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam at all, further exposing the British government's despicable intentions.

	The statement pointed out that the British government has always supported and aided the U.S. on the Vietnam issue. Now, the U.S. is using new cunning tactics to launch a new "peace offensive," attempting to deceive and mollify international public opinion and prepare for an escalation of the war of aggression against Vietnam. The British government's "call for peace" at this time is precisely to echo the U.S., allowing it to carry out more serious "escalations."

	Hanoi, January 3 (Xinhua) - An editorial in the January 3 issue of the Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" said that just as the world strongly condemns the U.S. imperialists' savage bombing of Hanoi, British Foreign Secretary George Brown issued a so-called "call for a conference to discuss a ceasefire in Vietnam," which is clearly in service of the U.S.'s "peace offensive."

	The article said that the British Labour government's "proposal" is nothing more than a rehash of the U.S. imperialists' old and cunning arguments of "unconditional negotiations," "ceasefire," and "simultaneous de-escalation." This is an apology for the U.S.'s unjust war against Vietnam.

	The article emphasized that the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Vietnam, and to stop this war, the U.S. must stop its aggression and withdraw its troops from Vietnam.

	The article concluded that the British government's "proposal" is merely an attempt to force the Vietnamese people to "negotiate" with U.S. aggressors under the pressure of U.S. troops and weapons, and to accept the U.S. imperialists' arrogant conditions. It is merely a means to echo the U.S.'s new "peace offensive" and to serve the U.S.'s plans to strengthen and expand the war. The British government's policy of following the U.S. can only lead it to suffer a shameful defeat along with U.S. imperialism.

	The "People's Army Newspaper" published an editorial on January 2 stating that the British government has been strongly condemned by domestic and international public opinion for its actions in following the U.S. in its aggression against Vietnam. Now, Brown's "peace call" is not only in service of the U.S. aggressors but also aims to ease public condemnation and deceive public opinion, attempting to make people forget the British government's criminal policy of serving as the U.S.'s henchman.

	The editorial continued, pointing out that the British Labour government's trick is not fooling anyone. Brown has always been Dean Rusk's mouthpiece.

	The editorial concluded that the British government's reversal of black and white, openly shielding the U.S. bandits' heinous crimes, is a brazen provocation to the people of the world. It further exposes the despicable face of U.S. imperialism's aggression and the British government's despicable face of following the U.S.

    越南外交部发言人指出美国正在“和平攻势”下进行战争“升级”
    英国建议完全是为美国侵略强盗效劳
    美国必须停止侵略并把侵略军全部撤出南越
    新华社河内四日电  越南民主共和国外交部发言人三日发表一项声明，揭露英国外交大臣布朗最近提出的所谓“和谈建议”完全是为美国侵略强盗效劳的。
    声明重申，“越南民主共和国政府一贯认为，美国是侵略者，美国必须停止侵略，把美军和它的各国帮凶军全部从越南南方撤走，停止对越南民主共和国的一切战争行动，让越南人民自己解决自己的事务，这样，和平就会立即恢复。”
    声明列举美国向越南南方派遣远征军和出动飞机轰炸越南北方等侵略罪行后指出，美国是侵略者，越南人民是被侵略者。但是，布朗却把侵略者和被侵略者等同起来，呼吁各个有关方面立即坐在一起讨论停战问题，而不要求美国必须停止侵略，把军队从越南南方撤出去，无条件地永远地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动。很明显，布朗是站在美国侵略者方面，来反对越南人民的。
    声明指出，布朗在他的建议中，根本不提越南南方民族解放阵线，这就更加暴露了英国政府的卑鄙意图。
    声明指出，英国政府向来对越南问题的政策是一贯支持和帮助美国的。现在，美国正在以新的狡诈手段进行一场新的“和平攻势”，妄图欺骗和缓和国际舆论和准备加强侵略越南的战争。英国政府在这个时候“呼吁和平”正是为了附和美国，以便让美国进行更严重的“升级”。
    据新华社河内三日电越南《人民报》三日发表的评论员文章说，正当美帝国主义野蛮轰炸河内的暴行受到全世界人民强烈谴责的时候，英国外交大臣布朗发出了所谓“召开讨论关于（越南的）休战问题的会议的呼吁”，这分明是为美国的“和平攻势”效劳的。
    文章说，英国工党政府的“建议”不外是重弹美帝国主义的“无条件谈判”、“休战”、“双方同时降级”等狡诈和陈旧的论调。这是为美国对越南进行的非正义战争辩解的。
    文章强调指出，美帝国主义者发动了侵略越南的战争，要停止这场战争，美国就必须停止侵略和把军队撤出越南。
    文章最后说，英国政府的“建议”，只不过是妄图迫使越南人民在美国军队和武器的压力下同美国侵略者“谈判”，并接受美帝国主义的蛮横条件的一种手段，只不过是附和美国的新的“和平攻势”和为美国准备加强和扩大战争的计划效劳的一种手段。英国政府追随美国的政策，只能使它同美帝国主义一起遭到可耻的失败。
    《人民军队报》二日发表评论说，英国政府在追随美国侵略越南的活动中，一直受到国内外舆论的强烈谴责。现在，布朗提出这个“和平呼吁”，除了为美国侵略者效劳之外，还想缓和舆论的谴责，同时欺骗舆论，妄图使人们忘记英国政府充当美国帮凶的罪恶政策。
    评论接着指出，英国工党政府这一手是欺骗不了谁的。布朗始终是腊斯克的喇叭。
    评论最后说，英国政府颠倒黑白，公然包庇美国强盗的滔天罪恶，这是对全世界人民的蛮横挑衅，同时也进一步暴露了美帝国主义的卑鄙的侵略面目和英国政府追随美国的卑鄙面目。
