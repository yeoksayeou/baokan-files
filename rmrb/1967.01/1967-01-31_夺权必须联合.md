The heavens belong to us, the land belongs to us, society belongs to us. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not act, who will? The urgent task of uniting the masses is something we must actively pursue!

Chairman Mao's teachings nurture the successors of the Communist cause and inspire the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat.

Seizing power—this is the essence of the revolution, the focal point of struggle, a life-and-death battle between two classes! Those who take the capitalist road and hold power use their usurped party power, state power, and economic power to suppress our proletariat, to overthrow us, and to drag our country down the dark path of capitalism. If we revolutionary rebels do not rise up to seize power, how can we succeed?!

Unity—this is the guarantee of victory, the source of power, and a crucial element for all revolutionary rebels to defeat their enemies! Only those who take the capitalist road and the stubborn few who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line fear and hate the unity of the revolutionary forces to the core. Only those who do not understand what revolution is, the confused and careless, think that unity or no unity makes no difference. True revolutionary rebels, however, deeply understand: to seize power, unity is necessary; without unity, there is no strength, and seizing power is out of the question.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast the document of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels nationwide. This great strategic decision points out the direction for the revolutionary forces nationwide and sets an example for the great unity of the revolutionary forces nationwide.

To unite, we must, like the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, have a common ideological foundation—this is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, this is the revolutionary rebellion under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. No compromise, no half-measures, no smoothing things over, and no "negotiations, strategies," or "parliamentary illusions"—all must be thrown out!

To unite, we must, like the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, firmly rely on the revolutionary leftists, unite with all who can be united, concentrate our forces, focus our targets, and fiercely strike down the handful who take the capitalist road and stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. We must not rely on a few people, take the upper-level route, and hold a few "multilateral talks." "If we do not firmly fight against the stubborn elements and achieve real results, we cannot resist the oppression of the stubborn elements, nor can we dispel the doubts of the middle elements, and the progressive forces will have no way to develop."

To unite, we must, like the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, "not only unite with those who have the same opinions as us, but also be good at uniting with those who have different opinions from us, and be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice." Revolutionary rebel organizations with different opinions should seek common ground while reserving differences on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought and must not allow any arrogance. For those truly deceived masses, we must warmly welcome them back into the fold and not exclude them on any pretext. Whether we can do this will directly relate to the consolidation and success of this great unity.

To unite, we must, like the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, always and everywhere use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to resist the infiltration of various non-proletarian thoughts, not allow liberalism to run rampant, cancel active ideological struggles, and destroy the unity within various revolutionary rebel organizations.

In a word, to unite, we must, like the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, act in the interests of the whole, and in the premise of a unified grand direction, not get bogged down in trivial issues. Resolutely oppose factionalism and oppose independence from the Party, the people, and the revolutionary rebels. Those who criticize others' hard struggles as "unstrategic" but want to pick the fruits of victory on the day of triumph, those who cover up their mistakes, think they are the best, and use any means for personal or small group interests, and those two-faced people who use Marxism-Leninism externally but think they are clever—these are not true revolutionaries. They are not concerned with national affairs but are driven by private desires and blinded by greed. "What are they up to? They seek fame, seek position, seek to make a name for themselves. When they are in charge of some affairs, they seek independence. For these, they gather some people, exclude some people, flatter and pull strings among comrades, and bring the vulgar style of bourgeois parties into the Communist Party." Such people are actually termites in the revolutionary ranks. Such styles are actually corrosive agents for the great unity of the revolutionary forces.

"The earth turns, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment."

"The urgent task of uniting the masses is something we must actively pursue!"

Revolutionary rebel comrades, let us take the Shanghai revolutionary rebels as our example, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and on the premise of a unified grand direction, unite! Launch a fierce attack on those who take the capitalist road and stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and more effectively carry out the struggle to seize power!

　　夺权必须联合
　　北京地质学院东方红公社
      “天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？刻不容缓的民众大联合，我们应该积极进行！”
    毛主席的教导，哺育着共产主义事业接班人，激励着无产阶级革命造反派。
    夺权，这是革命的根本，斗争的焦点，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的一场肉搏战！那些走资本主义道路的当权派，利用他们窃据的党权、政权、财权，要专我们无产阶级的政，要推翻我们无产阶级，要把我们的国家拉上资本主义的黑道。我们革命造反派，不起来夺权，怎么能行？！
    联合，这是胜利的保证，权力的来源，是一切革命造反派克敌制胜的重要一环！只有走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮混蛋，才对革命派的联合怕得要死，恨之入骨。只有那些不懂得什么叫革命的糊涂虫、马大哈，才以为联合不联合也不过如此这般。而真正的革命造反者，却深深地懂得：要夺权，就必须联合；不联合，就没有力量，就谈不上夺权。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定向全国广播了上海革命造反派的文件。这一伟大的战略决策，指出了全国革命派前进的方向，树起了全国革命派大联合的样板。
    要联合，就必须象上海的革命造反派那样，有一个共同的思想基础，这就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，这就是毛泽东思想指导下的革命造反！什么调和、折衷、抹稀泥，还有什么“谈判、策略”、“议会迷”，都统统滚他妈的蛋！
    要联合，就必须象上海的革命造反派那样，坚定地依靠革命左派，团结一切可以团结的人，集中力量，集中目标，狠狠地打击一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，而决不能只靠少数人，走走上层路线，搞几次“多边会谈”。“如不同顽固派作坚决的斗争，并收到确实的成效，就不能抵抗顽固派的压迫，也不能消释中间派的怀疑，进步势力就无从发展。”
    要联合，就必须象上海的革命造反派那样，“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”持有不同意见的各革命造反派组织，应在毛泽东思想的原则基础上求同存异，决不允许搞唯我独尊。对那些真正受蒙蔽的群众，要热情地欢迎他们归队，而不得以任何借口将他们排斥在外。能否做到这一点，将直接关系着这个大联合的巩固、成败。
    要联合，就必须象上海的革命造反派那样，随时随地用批评和自我批评的武器，抵制形形色色的非无产阶级思想的侵蚀，决不允许自由主义泛滥，取消积极的思想斗争，破坏各革命造反派组织内部的团结。
    一句话，要联合，就必须象上海的革命造反派那样，大破私字，大立公字，以“老三篇”为座右铭，一切从全局利益出发，在大方向一致的前提下，决不在枝节问题上纠缠不清。坚决反对山头主义，反对向党向人民向革命造反派闹独立性。那些把别人的艰苦斗争指责为
  “不策略”，而到胜利之日又要伸手摘桃子的人，那些文过饰非，老子天下第一，为个人或小团体利益而不择手段的人，还有那些两面派，专门以马列主义对外，而自以为得计的人，绝不是真正的革命者。他们不是关心国家大事，而是私欲熏心，利令智昏。“这种人闹什么东西呢？闹名誉，闹地位，闹出风头。在他们掌管一部分事业的时候，就要闹独立性。为了这些，就要拉拢一些人，排挤一些人，在同志中吹吹拍拍，拉拉扯扯，把资产阶级政党的庸俗作风也搬进共产党里来了”。这种人其实是革命队伍里的蠹虫。这种作风其实是革命派大联合的腐蚀剂。
      “天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”
      “刻不容缓的民众大联合，我们应该积极进行！”
    革命造反派的战友们，让我们以上海的革命造反派为榜样，在毛泽东思想的指引下，在大方向一致的前提下，联合起来！向走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人发起猛攻，更有效地开展夺权斗争！
