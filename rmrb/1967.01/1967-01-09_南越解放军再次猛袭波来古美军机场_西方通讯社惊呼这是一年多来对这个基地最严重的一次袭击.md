	South Vietnamese Liberation Army Launches Heavy Attack on U.S. Military Airbase in Pleiku
	Western News Agencies Exclaim This is the Most Severe Attack on This Base in Over a Year

	BEIJING, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) — Reports from Saigon indicate that the armed forces of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army launched a fierce attack on the U.S. military airbase in Pleiku on January 7.

	Initial reports from Western news agencies reveal that many U.S. aggressor troops were killed, numerous aircraft stationed at the base were destroyed, and several buildings on the base were also demolished.

	The reports state that this attack is the "most severe assault on this central highlands base by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army in over a year." The attack began at 1:30 AM local time. Under the cover of intense mortar fire, Liberation Army soldiers bravely infiltrated the base's defensive positions and threw explosive packages at enemy aircraft and buildings.

	The Pleiku airbase is not only a crucial U.S. military airbase in the central highlands of South Vietnam but also a key hub for the assembly and transport of troops. The Liberation Army has repeatedly attacked this base.

	On February 7, 1965, the Liberation Army launched its first surprise attack on this base, annihilating over 350 U.S. aggressor troops and destroying or damaging more than 40 enemy aircraft.

	On April 21, 1966, the Liberation Army once again attacked this base, achieving a resounding victory by killing or wounding over 500 enemy troops and destroying nearly 60 enemy aircraft.

    南越解放军再次猛袭波来古美军机场
    西方通讯社惊呼这是一年多来对这个基地最严重的一次袭击
    新华社七日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量七日向波来古美军机场发动猛烈袭击。
    据西方通讯社初步消息透露，许多美国侵略军被击毙，停在机场上的许多飞机被击毁，机场上的若干建筑物也被击毁。
    消息说，这次袭击是越南南方解放军“一年多来对这个中部高原基地进行的最严重的一次袭击”。这次袭击是在当地时间凌晨一时半开始的。解放军战士在猛烈的迫击炮火掩护下，勇敢地突入机场防御阵地，向敌人飞机和建筑物投掷了炸药包。
    波来古机场不仅是美国侵略军在南越中部高原地区的一个重要空军基地，也是一个集结和调运军队的中心。解放武装力量曾不断袭击这个机场。
    一九六五年二月七日，解放武装力量向这个机场发动第一次奇袭，一举歼灭美国侵略军三百五十多名，毁伤敌机四十多架。
    一九六六年四月二十一日，解放武装力量再次袭击这个机场，取得击毙击伤敌军五百多名，击毁敌机近六十架的辉煌胜利。
