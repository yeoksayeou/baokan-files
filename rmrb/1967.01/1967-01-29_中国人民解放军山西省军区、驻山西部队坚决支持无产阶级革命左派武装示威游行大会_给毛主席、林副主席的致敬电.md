Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 28th. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Shanxi Provincial Military Region and troops stationed in Shanxi resolutely support the armed demonstration and parade of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat. A telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

Dearest Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin:

We, the entire cadre and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Shanxi Provincial Military Region and troops stationed in Shanxi, pay our highest proletarian revolutionary respect to you!

At this crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering a new stage and the true revolutionary leftists are engaged in a decisive class struggle against a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, Chairman Mao has issued instructions to the entire army to resolutely support and assist the revolutionary leftists. This is the greatest concern, the greatest trust, and the greatest encouragement for all the cadre and soldiers of the entire army. We enthusiastically cheer, cheering for the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!

We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, stand firmly on the side of the revolutionary masses, and most resolutely assist the true revolutionary leftists. We will wholeheartedly, unhesitatingly, and with all our hearts support the revolutionary leftists in seizing power. We will resolutely support them and decisively defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We will thoroughly smash the plots and tricks of the bourgeois reactionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

We will resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Whenever the true revolutionary leftists need our support and assistance, we will definitely meet their demands. We will suppress those who oppose the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat and sabotage the Cultural Revolution, those who are current counter-revolutionaries and counter-revolutionary organizations. If the enemy does not surrender, we will resolutely annihilate them.

In the past, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, we fearlessly rushed into the fire, fought bravely, and shed our blood to build the proletarian regime for the people. Today, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee want to turn Shanxi into a base for their capitalist restoration in China. We will never agree to this. We understand that the proletarian regime was seized by us with our guns, and today it must be defended with our guns. We will definitely stand with the true revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, thoroughly defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, seize all power from their hands, and firmly grasp it in the hands of the revolutionary leftists. We will not retreat until we achieve complete victory.

Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

The Chinese People's Liberation Army Shanxi Provincial Military Region and troops stationed in Shanxi resolutely support the armed demonstration and parade of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat.

　　给毛主席、林副主席的致敬电
    新华社太原二十八日电　中国人民解放军山西省军区、驻山西部队坚决支持无产阶级革命左派武装示威游行大会给毛主席、林副主席的致敬电
    最最敬爱的毛主席、林副主席：
    我们，中国人民解放军山西省军区和驻山西部队全体指战员，向您们致以最崇高的无产阶级的革命敬礼！
    正当全国无产阶级文化大革命进入一个新阶段，真正的无产阶级革命派同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行阶级大决战的关键时刻，毛主席向我们全军发出了指示，要我们坚决支持和援助无产阶级革命派。这是对我们全军指战员的最大关怀，最大信任，最大鼓舞。我们热烈地欢呼，欢呼伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    我们要坚决听毛主席的话，旗帜鲜明地站在广大革命群众方面，最坚决地援助真正的革命左派，满腔热情地、毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持无产阶级革命造反派起来夺权，毫不犹豫地支持他们，坚决打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底地粉碎资产阶级反动路线的阴谋诡计，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们要坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，凡是真正的无产阶级革命派要我们部队支持和援助时，我们一定满足他们的要求。对于那些反对无产阶级革命左派和破坏文化大革命的现行反革命分子、反革命组织予以镇压。敌人不投降，坚决消灭之。
    过去，我们在毛主席的英明领导下，赴汤蹈火，前赴后继，抛头颅，洒热血，为人民打下了江山，建立了无产阶级的政权。今天，山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，妄想把山西省搞成他们在中国进行资本主义复辟的一个根据地，我们坚决不答应。我们懂得，无产阶级的政权，是我们用枪杆子夺来的，今天也要用枪杆子来保卫。我们一定要和真正的无产阶级革命派站在一起，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底打倒，把一切权力从他们手里夺回来，牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    祝我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆！
    中国人民解放军山西省军区、驻山西部队坚决支持无产阶级革命左派武装示威游行大会
              一九六七年一月二十七日
