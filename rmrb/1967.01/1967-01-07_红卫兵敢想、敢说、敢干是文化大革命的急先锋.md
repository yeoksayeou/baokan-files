In Hangzhou's Xishan Park, a group of Red Guard youth sat on the grass, singing revolutionary songs. At that moment, a foreign friend from East Africa walked into their midst and greeted them in Chinese, saying, "Hello, Red Guards!" He then suggested, "Can we have a discussion together?" The youth welcomed the foreign guest's proposal with enthusiastic applause. Thus, a lively and spirited discussion naturally began.

The Red Guard youth told the foreign friend, "We love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts." The foreign friend replied, "You said it well. Chairman Mao belongs not only to the Chinese people but also to the people of all countries. Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in your hearts but also in ours."

A female Red Guard asked the foreign friend, "Do you like the Red Guards and our Cultural Revolution?" The East African friend replied, "Very much. The Red Guards are our heroes. The Red Guards dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and are the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards and the Cultural Revolution are unprecedented in history, a great development in the world proletarian revolution led by Mao Zedong, and a new chapter in the international communist movement." The foreign friend's words were met with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause.

Finally, amidst the slogans of "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the Cultural Revolution!", the lively discussion came to an end.

    红卫兵敢想、敢说、敢干是文化大革命的急先锋
    在杭州西山公园，一群红卫兵小将围坐在草地上，高唱着革命歌曲。这时，一位来自东非的外国朋友走到了他们中间，用中国话说：“红卫兵们好！”随后，这位外国朋友提出：“我们一起谈谈好吗？”小将们用热烈的掌声欢迎外宾的倡议。于是一个生动活泼的讨论会自然地开始了。
    红卫兵小将们对外国朋友说：“我们热爱毛主席，毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。”外国朋友说：“你们说得好。毛主席不仅属于中国人民，也属于世界各国人民。毛主席不仅是你们心里的红太阳，也是我们心里的红太阳。”
    一个女红卫兵问外国朋友：“你喜欢红卫兵，喜欢我们的文化大革命吗？”东非朋友回答说：“非常喜欢，红卫兵是我们的英雄。红卫兵敢想、敢说、敢干，是无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋。红卫兵和无产阶级文化大革命是历史上从未有过的事迹，是毛泽东领导的世界无产阶级革命的伟大发展，是国际共产主义运动的新篇章。”东非朋友的话赢得了一阵又一阵热烈的掌声。
    最后，在高呼“毛主席万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”的口号声中结束了这个热烈的讨论会。
