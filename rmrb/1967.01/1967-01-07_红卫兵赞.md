A friend from Syria's capital Damascus recently wrote to the young Red Guards of China, expressing his admiration for their revolutionary actions and contributions during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The letter states: The heroic young Red Guards are holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, defending the Chinese revolution, ensuring that China will never change color, and forever remain a pillar against American imperialism and modern revisionism.

The letter says: The Chinese Cultural Revolution is the first new-type revolution in the world. "The Cultural Revolution has established the victory of proletarian ideology and culture over bourgeois ideology and culture."

The letter points out that Chairman Mao taught, "After the enemies with guns have been wiped out, there are still enemies without guns who will inevitably engage in a life-and-death struggle with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." The Chinese Cultural Revolution fully proves the correctness of Mao's wise judgment. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the victory of Marxism-Leninism in our era.

The letter further states: "Young Red Guards, your Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shattered the illusions of all revisionists and imperialist lackeys who attempted to sabotage the Chinese revolution, uprooting all the roots of revisionism and bourgeois filth. This is not only your victory but also our victory in the struggle against American, British imperialism, Zionism, and reactionaries."

The letter says, "The Chinese Red Guards are a new generation of socialists with proletarian ideology and culture, and they are models for proletarian intellectuals." The letter concludes, "You stand in stark contrast to those Soviet youths who pursue a life of decadence and debauchery. You are the best teachers for Arab youth and our role models."

Inspiration to the People of the World

The Africa-Shetazi Youth League of Tanzania's Zanzibar recently wrote to the Chinese Red Guards, stating that you listen to Chairman Mao's words, and your actions greatly inspire us and the workers and peasants of the world.

The letter emphasizes: "The imperialists have not put down their butcher's knives; they are still slaughtering workers and peasants. However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Therefore, we must expose them, overthrow them, and smash them."

The letter also states, you follow the teachings of Chairman Mao Zedong, continuing to oppose the revisionists, which is of immeasurable importance to the people of various countries struggling to free themselves from capitalist oppression. Your victory is not only the victory of the Chinese people but also the victory of the people of the world.

A friend from Nepal is carefully examining a photograph of the activities of our country's Red Guards and enthusiastically praising the revolutionary actions of the young Red Guards.

    红卫兵赞
    社会主义的一代新人
    一位住在叙利亚首都大马士革的阿拉伯朋友最近写信给中国红卫兵小将，热烈赞扬他们的革命行动和他们在无产阶级文化大革命中所作出的贡献。
    来信说：英雄的红卫兵小将高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，保卫中国革命，使中国永不变色，永远成为反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的支柱。
    信里说：中国文化大革命，是世界上第一次出现的新型革命。“文化大革命已确立了无产阶级思想、文化对资产阶级思想、文化的胜利”。
    来信指出，毛泽东主席教导说，“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”中国的文化大革命完全证明了毛泽东的英明论断。无产阶级文化大革命的胜利是我们时代马克思列宁主义的胜利。
    来信还说：“红卫兵小将们，你们的无产阶级文化大革命打破了一切修正主义和帝国主义走狗妄想破坏中国革命的迷梦，拔掉了修正主义和资产阶级的一切渣滓的根子，这不仅是你们的胜利，也是我们反对美、英帝国主义、犹太复国主义和反动派的斗争的胜利。”
    信里说，“中国红卫兵是具有无产阶级思想、文化的社会主义一代新人，是无产阶级知识分子的榜样。”信里最后说：“你们与那些追求糜烂、放荡生活的苏联青年恰成鲜明的对比，你们是阿拉伯青年最好的老师，是我们学习的榜样。”
    对全世界人民的鼓舞
    坦桑尼亚桑给巴尔的非洲—设拉子青年联盟不久前在写给中国红卫兵的信中说，你们听毛主席的话，你们的行动大大鼓舞了我们以及全世界的工人和农民。
    这封信强调指出：“帝国主义者没有放下屠刀，他们正在屠杀工人和农民。但是正如毛主席所指出的，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。因此，我们必须揭露他们、打倒他们和粉碎他们。”
    这封信还说，你们遵循毛泽东主席的教导，继续反对修正主义者，这对于为摆脱资本主义压迫而斗争的各国人民来说，其重要性是无法估量的。你们的胜利不仅是中国人民的胜利，而且也是全世界人民的胜利。
