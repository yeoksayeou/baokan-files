Revolutionary workers in Shanghai are indeed right in their rebellion! They are doing it well! We firmly support your revolutionary actions and humbly learn from your revolutionary spirit of rebellion!

In our Beijing Hat Factory, a small clique of those in power who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line have been trying every means to resist the great leader Chairman Mao's directive of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." They attempt to extinguish the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We revolutionary workers have seen through their true colors, exposed their schemes, and resolutely smashed their new counterattacks.

In the early stages of the movement, they used production to suppress the revolution, not allowing us time to engage in the movement. In early November, when we rose up in rebellion, they came up with various new tricks to suppress the revolution. Their first trick was to reorganize the structure, attempting to disperse everyone's attention and make the movement cold and quiet. We exposed their schemes in time, and their plots did not succeed.

Next, they played another big trick: they exploited the fact that our factory's wage system was somewhat unreasonable, inciting a part of the masses to demand wage increases, misleading the masses, and buying their hearts. They attempted to shift the direction of the struggle, leading the masses' political struggle onto the path of economism.

We revolutionary workers clearly see: unreasonable wages should indeed be adjusted, but the current issue is not whether or not to adjust wages, but whether or not to make the revolution. Chairman Mao said: "We must advocate considering the bigger picture. Every party member, every part of the work, every word or action, must start from the interests of the whole party and absolutely must not violate this principle." We understand that wages only relate to personal life, but whether or not to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution well relates to the most important issue of whether the country changes color. We cannot, for the sake of personal interests, forget about the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. That small clique of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, who want to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and restore capitalism in China, we absolutely do not agree. We resolutely smash their schemes!

Through this stage of struggle with the class enemy, we personally feel that they are cunning, the struggle is complex, and they are not willing to accept their defeat, always wanting to counterattack and make a final struggle. We revolutionary masses must never relax our vigilance, never give up the struggle. We must firmly grasp the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly smash the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    革命工人最顾全大局
    上海革命造反派的工人们，你们造反造得对！造得好！我们坚决支持你们的革命行动，虚心学习你们的革命造反精神！
    我们北京制帽厂的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，也千方百计对抗我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，企图扑灭无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。我们革命的职工看透了他们的嘴脸，揭穿了他们的阴谋，坚决粉碎了他们的新反扑。
    运动初期，他们以生产压革命，不让我们有搞运动的时间。十一月初，我们起来造反了，他们就使出各种新花招，来压制革命。他们的第一个花招是调整机构，企图分散大家的注意力，让运动变得冷冷清清。我们及时予以揭露，他们的阴谋没有得逞。
    接着，他们又玩弄一个大花招：利用我们厂工资制度有些不合理的现象，挑动一部分群众，提出增加工资的要求，蛊惑群众，收买人心，企图转移斗争大方向，把群众的政治斗争引向经济主义的歧途。
    我们革命工人清醒地看到：不合理的工资是应当调整的，但是目前不是要不要调整工资的问题，而是要不要革命的大问题。毛主席说：“要提倡顾全大局。每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”我们懂得，工资只关系到个人的生活，而要不要搞好文化大革命，却关系到国家变不变颜色的头等重大问题。我们决不能为了个人利益，而忘记中国革命和世界革命。那一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，妄想扼杀无产阶级文化大革命，在中国复辟资本主义，我们万万不答应。我们坚决粉碎他们的阴谋！
    通过这一阶段和阶级敌人的初步较量，我们亲身体会到，他们是狡猾的，斗争是复杂的，他们决不甘心于自己的失败，总想反扑，总想作最后挣扎。我们革命群众，一刻也不能放松警惕，一刻也不能放弃斗争。我们一定要牢牢掌握毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
