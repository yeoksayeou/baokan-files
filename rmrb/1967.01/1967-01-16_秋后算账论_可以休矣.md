The Theory of Settling Scores in Autumn Can Be Put to Rest

A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and a small number of diehards who stubbornly cling to the bourgeois reactionary line, in order to resist the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, shamelessly concocted various fallacies. The "theory of settling scores in autumn" is one of the most vicious ones.

Those who spread this fallacy go around confusing people's minds, saying: "Now we are luring the snakes out of their holes, and when all the snakes come out, we will catch them all in one net." Some even boast that after the movement, they will "resume their original posts," threatening those who post big-character posters against them, saying: "Who is right and who is wrong has not been decided yet, and you are criticizing me now, but later I will be waiting for you to apologize." There are also some who, on the surface, pretend to be upright gentlemen, advocating the mobilization of the masses and the protection of the minority, but in secret say: "Let them (referring to the revolutionary rebels) go ahead and cause trouble! Expose them, 'protect' them for a while, and then make a conclusion later."

Those who spread this fallacy not only talk but also act, committing many despicable and filthy crimes. Soon after the Cultural Revolution began, some of them couldn't wait to classify the masses, write opinions on their handling, and were busy as bees. Some took photos of the big-character posters written by the revolutionary rebels and hid them away. Some even incited and utilized some deceived masses, using the opportunity of linking up to investigate the history of the revolutionary rebels everywhere, collecting so-called "anti-party materials" from the revolutionary masses, hoping to one day carry out a counterattack and settle scores.

These few people thought that by waving the big stick of "settling scores in autumn" and their secret weapon—the black materials, which they worshipped as gods—they could scare the revolutionary masses, suppress them, make the revolutionary rebels obedient and at their beck and call, and keep their official hats. Unfortunately, the development of things does not follow their subjective wishes. Like all the donkeys in history, their end can only be "lifting a stone to drop on their own feet," and they will not have a good ending.

Mr. "Theory of Settling Scores in Autumn," you want to "lure the snakes out of their holes" and "catch them all in one net," right? In fact, the real snakes are not others, but precisely yourselves. You, this handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and diehards who stubbornly cling to the bourgeois reactionary line, are the big snakes and small snakes, black snakes and white snakes, snakes that bare their fangs and snakes that transform into beautiful women on the land of China. In the past, you wore the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, turning the units under your control into dens of surrender and betrayal, spreading poison at will, and committing a large number of despicable acts against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Today, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, tens of millions of revolutionary masses have taken up iron brooms, smashed your dens, and swept you out like garbage, one by one. You have already fallen into the encirclement of the revolutionary masses and have begun to collapse on all fronts. The fate of being "caught all in one net" by the revolutionary masses will inevitably befall you.

Mr. "Theory of Settling Scores in Autumn," you dream of "resuming original posts" in the later stage of the movement, and you are waiting for the revolutionary masses to "apologize" to you, right? Open your eyes and see! Today, whose territory is the vast land of our motherland?! The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is increasingly grasped by the broad masses. The strongholds of the bourgeois reactionary line are being taken over one by one. Your days of tyranny and arrogance are gone forever. In the later stage of the movement, Mao Zedong Thought will be even more deeply rooted in people's hearts, the dictatorship of the proletariat will be even more consolidated, and the eyes of the revolutionary masses will be even brighter. Your dream of overturning the situation will be even more impossible to realize.

Mr. "Theory of Settling Scores in Autumn," perhaps in your safe, you still have a batch of black materials for framing the revolutionary masses. You think that by holding this "secret weapon," you have the capital for a counterattack and settling scores. Let me tell you frankly! The revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought dare to climb the mountain of knives and leap into the sea of fire. A few black materials cannot stop their advance. The black materials you have painstakingly preserved can only serve as evidence of your stubborn adherence to the bourgeois reactionary line.

Mr. "Theory of Settling Scores in Autumn," it is better to put away your junk now! You don't need to wait until "autumn," the revolutionary masses want to settle accounts with you now. Every bad deed you have done, who did what, who should be severely punished, who should be lightly punished, the revolutionary masses have a very clear calculation. You cannot evade it or run away. The only way out is to honestly bow your head and confess to the people. If you still want to play new tricks, then bring them out! But remember: every account you owe to the Party and the people, whether it is an old account or a new account, if it is not settled clearly, the revolutionary masses will not rest until it is.

Thunderclaps open new worlds, and east winds sweep away the remaining clouds. The situation of the Cultural Revolution is excellent. Let us advance victoriously, strike hard and pursue relentlessly, and sweep away all the harmful insects hiding in the dark corners. Let those jumping jacks of the "theory of settling scores in autumn" roll into the historical garbage dump with the black materials they have collected!

### “秋后算账论”可以休矣

    “秋后算账论”可以休矣
    一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，为了对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，无耻地编造了种种谬论。“秋后算账论”便是其中很恶毒的一种。
    散布这种论调的人，到处蛊惑人心地说：“现在是引蛇出洞，等蛇都出来了，就一网打尽。”有的人还扬言运动后期要“官复原职”，威胁给他贴大字报的革命群众说：“谁是谁非，现在还没定，你们现在整我，将来我等着你们给我赔礼道歉。”也有一些人，表面上装得像正人君子，也大讲要发动群众，要保护少数，暗地里却说：“让他们（指革命造反派）去放、去闹吧！暴露出来，‘保护’一些时候，将来好作结论。”
    散布这种论调的人，不仅有言论，而且已经见之于行动，干了不少卑鄙龌龊的罪恶勾当。文化大革命开始不久，有的就迫不及待地给群众排队、分类、写处理意见，忙得不亦乐乎。有的把革命造反派写的大字报，拍照藏起来，有的甚至煽动、利用一些受蒙蔽的群众，借串连的机会，到处调查革命造反派的历史，搜集革命群众的所谓“反党材料”，妄想有朝一日实行反攻倒算。
    这一小撮人自以为挥舞“秋后算账”的大棒，再加上他们捧作神灵的秘密武器——黑材料，就能把革命群众吓住，压下去，就能使革命造反派服服贴贴，听凭他们的摆布，就能保住他们的乌纱帽。可惜，事物的发展总是不以他们的主观愿望为转移的。和历史上所有的蠢驴一样，他们的结局也只能是“搬起石头砸自己的脚”，没有好下场。
    “秋后算账论”的先生们，你们不是要“引蛇出洞”、“一网打尽”吗？其实，真正的毒蛇不是别人，而恰恰是你们自己。你们这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，就是盘踞在中国土地上的大蛇和小蛇，黑蛇和白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇。过去，你们披着马列主义的外衣，把你们控制下的单位变成招降纳叛、肆意放毒的黑窝，干了大量反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的卑鄙勾当。今天，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，亿万革命群众抡起铁扫帚，捣毁了你们的黑窝，像扫垃圾一样，把你们一个一个地扫了出来。你们已经陷入革命群众的重重包围之中，开始全线崩溃，被革命群众“一网打尽”的命运必然会落到你们自己身上。
    “秋后算账论”的先生们，你们不是梦想运动后期“官复原职”，你们不是等着革命群众来给你们“赔礼道歉”吗？睁开你们的双眼看一看吧！今天祖国的万里山河已经是谁家的天下？！毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的道路，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线日益为广大群众所掌握，资产阶级反动路线盘踞的顽固堡垒，一个一个地被夺取过来。你们横行霸道、作威作福的时代，一去不复返了。运动后期，毛泽东思想将会更加深入人心，无产阶级专政将会更加巩固，革命群众的眼睛将会更加明亮。你们妄想翻天的美梦，到那时候就更加做不成了。
    “秋后算账论”的先生们，也许在你们的保险柜里，至今还藏着一批整革命群众的黑材料。你们自以为掌握了这个“秘密武器”，就有了反攻倒算的资本。老实告诉你们吧！用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，几份黑材料是根本阻挡不住他们前进的步伐的。你们挖空心思保藏的黑材料只能有一个用处，那就是，作为你们顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的罪证。
    “秋后算账论”的先生们，还是把你们的破烂货色统统收起来吧！用不着等到“秋后”，革命群众现在就要和你们算总账了。你们所做的坏事，一件件，一桩桩，谁个最甚，谁个稍次，谁个惩办要严，谁个处罚从轻，革命群众都有极明白的计算。你们赖不掉，也溜不了。唯一的出路就是老老实实，向人民低头认罪。如果你们还想耍什么新的花招，那么也请拿出来吧！不过要记住：你们对党对人民欠下的每一笔账，不管是旧账，还是新账，不算个一清二楚，革命群众是誓不罢休的。
    千钧霹雳开新宇，万里东风扫残云。文化大革命形势大好，让我们乘胜前进，猛打穷追，把藏在黑暗角落里的一切害人虫统统扫除，让那些“秋后算账论”的跳梁小丑们抱着他们搜集的黑材料一起滚进历史垃圾堆吧！
