Sailors from all over the world, hailing from five continents and three oceans, who come to and depart from China's ports, use the most beautiful language and the most sincere feelings to enthusiastically praise the great leader of the Chinese people and the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and to praise the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The sailors from various countries, with boundless affection, say: "Mao Zedong belongs to the entire progressive humanity of the world," "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of all the people of the world," "Mao Zedong Thought is the revolutionary lighthouse illuminating the entire globe."

In China's Guangzhou's Huangpu Port, Shanghai, Qingdao, and other places, tens of thousands of sailors from various countries are received each year. Their languages and skin colors differ, but as soon as they see Chinese comrades, they raise their thumbs and shout passionately: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" Some shout in Chinese: "Long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao is the savior of the world's people

The crew members of the Albanian commercial ship "Fiorella," which is on the front line of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, watched large-scale color documentaries in Huangpu Port, such as "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army" and "Chairman Mao Meets the Red Guards and Revolutionary Teachers and Students." Whenever Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, the crew members enthusiastically applauded, expressing their most sincere and fervent feelings, wishing Chairman Mao a long life. They said: Chairman Mao Zedong belongs not only to China but also to Albania, to the entire international communist movement, and to the entire progressive humanity of the world. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people, the savior of the Chinese people, and also the great leader of the world's people, the savior of the world's people.

A Japanese sailor who came to Shanghai said: Chairman Mao is truly for the people. We, the Japanese people, love Chairman Mao. The great Mao Zedong Thought will definitely become the thought of the Japanese people.

A Mauritian sailor, Nayak, came to Qingdao and eagerly wanted to buy a foreign-language edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." When his wish was fulfilled, he excitedly said: "I will gain truth from this book."

Friends from various countries compare Chairman Mao to the red sun in their hearts. A Dutch sailor pointed to a portrait of Chairman Mao with one hand, pointed to the sun in the sky with another hand, and then pointed to his own chest, telling a Chinese worker: "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts. China has the great leader Chairman Mao, and China's friends are all over the world."

The health of Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. Foreign sailors all enthusiastically care about Chairman Mao's health. A Greek sailor who came to Qingdao told a Chinese friend: "In Tianjin, I saw from the movies that Chairman Mao is very healthy. I bought a silk portrait of Chairman Mao to take back to Greece to tell the Greek people that Chairman Mao is very healthy." Two elderly Greek sailors were both surprised and delighted to hear the news that Chairman Mao had swum across the Yangtze River. They raised their thumbs and said repeatedly: "Amazing! Amazing! We sincerely hope that Chairman Mao Zedong is in good health and lives forever."

With Chairman Mao, the African people have hope

Once, a worker from Huangpu Port was assigned to perform duties on a Cypriot commercial ship docked at the port. When he finished his work and was about to leave the ship, an African sailor came up to him, raised his thumb, and said: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" This African sailor excitedly moved forward and touched the badge of Chairman Mao's portrait worn by the Chinese worker. The Chinese worker understood his meaning and gave the Chairman Mao badge to this African friend. The African sailor was overjoyed and hugged the Chinese comrade enthusiastically, saying excitedly: "The Chinese revolution has set an example for all countries striving for national independence. We respect Mao Zedong; he is the red sun rising in the East, the hope of progressive humanity. With Chairman Mao, we African people have hope."

Many sailors from Africa have shown boundless love for Chairman Mao. A Moroccan sailor who came to Shanghai told a Chinese friend: "We, the Moroccan people, love New China and wish the great leader Chairman Mao a long life." Many foreign sailors who came to Shanghai considered the most important thing to be obtaining Chairman Mao's works and Chairman Mao badges. After wearing Chairman Mao badges on their chests, they all felt it was the most honorable thing. A Greek ship came to Shanghai, and a foreign engineer on the ship was overjoyed to receive a Chairman Mao badge. He wore all the Chairman Mao badges he received on his chest. He said: "This is the most precious gift given to me by the Chinese people. Chairman Mao is the greatest person in the world. I will wear it and go to various countries."

Spread Mao Zedong Thought to the entire world

Sailors from various countries have boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought and boundless love for Chairman Mao's works. They bring Mao Zedong Thought from China and spread it to the ends of the earth, to the entire world.

Sailors who came to Guangzhou's Huangpu Port enthusiastically praised: "Chairman Mao, in his great revolutionary practice, has brilliantly inherited and developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is a comprehensive summary of the new experiences of the international communist movement, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, and is therefore the guiding light of the world revolution."

Sailors from various countries regard Mao Zedong Thought as the "lighthouse in the sea," the "rudder of the revolutionary ship," and the "torch illuminating all humanity." A sailor from Venezuela said: "Chairman Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought belong not only to the Chinese people but also to us, the people of Latin America, and the people of the entire world. Chairman Mao's books are my favorites. They speak the words in the hearts of laboring people and point out the direction of struggle. We, the people of Venezuela, relying on the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely drive out American imperialism and achieve true national independence and liberation."

A boatswain from Zanzibar said: "Every word of Chairman Mao is the truth." Another fireman from Zanzibar said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the torch illuminating all humanity and the compass guiding the struggle of the oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. We, the people of Zanzibar, will never forget Chairman Mao's famous statement that 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'"

The broad masses of sailors read Chairman Mao's books with deep feelings. They regard Chairman Mao's works as priceless treasures. A cook from a British merchant ship who was hospitalized in Guangzhou for over a month due to illness said excitedly to a Chinese worker when he recovered and was about to return home: "I love Chairman Mao very much. Chairman Mao's books are all truths. During my hospitalization, I finished reading 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' and learned a lot. I deeply feel that it is a great spiritual force to overthrow American imperialism and smash modern revisionism, and a powerful weapon for the world's people's revolution." The third officer of the Vietnamese ship "Shuibian," during the ship's stopover in Huangpu Port, studied "Quotations from Chairman Mao" every day with Chinese workers. He regarded Chairman Mao's works as air and food, not being able to do without Mao Zedong Thought for a moment. A French sailor who came to Qingdao obtained several books by Chairman Mao and could not help but shout: "Mao Zedong is good, Mao Zedong is great. The true communists and people of France all love Mao Zedong."

In the sailors' clubs in Shanghai and Qingdao, there are often moving scenes of foreign sailors eagerly buying Chairman Mao's works. They say that carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them can benefit them at any time. A Sudanese sailor said that many people in Sudan study Chairman Mao's works, and Chairman Mao's works are our favorite treasures. A British sailor who had just disembarked in Qingdao eagerly told a Chinese worker: "Mao Zedong is the greatest and most noble person. I love reading Mao Zedong's books the most." He eagerly bought Chairman Mao's works. Many foreign sailors, after reading Chairman Mao's books, firmly believe: With Mao Zedong Thought arming the Chinese people, China will never change color. With Mao Zedong Thought, the world revolution has hope.

China is the center of the world revolution

Sailors from various countries who come to China see China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great changes in the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and they are all moved.

Recently, a Japanese sailor who came to Shanghai saw the situation of China's Cultural Revolution with his own eyes and said excitedly that this revolution is too great and completely different from what is reported in Japanese newspapers. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the contemporary world. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, China has become the center of the world revolution.

Some foreign sailors, seeing the high revolutionary enthusiasm and noble moral character of the Chinese people, are often moved to tears. Once, an elderly Finnish sailor burned his hand on the ship and did not receive treatment. When he came to Shanghai, a tricycle worker noticed his injured hand and persuaded him to go to the hospital for treatment, even personally taking him to the hospital. This made him shed tears. The old sailor, comparing the situation when he came to Shanghai twenty years ago, said excitedly that Shanghai is now a revolutionary city, the Chinese people are all living a happy life, and they sincerely help foreign workers like us. This is the result of Chairman Mao's teachings. Many foreign sailors who came to the Shanghai Sailors' Club often stood in front of the statue of Chairman Mao, gazing at Chairman Mao's benevolent smile for a long time and unwilling to leave. Some sailors even copied down the quotations of Chairman Mao on the wall word by word. They showed boundless affection, loving Chairman Mao and the great New China.

    毛泽东思想是照亮全世界的革命灯塔
    ——各国海员热爱伟大领袖毛主席
    进出我国海港的来自世界五大洲、三大洋的各国海员们，用最美好的语言和最真挚的感情，热烈赞颂中国人民和世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，赞颂伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。各国海员们怀着无限深情说：“毛泽东属于整个世界进步人类”、“毛主席是全世界人民心中的红太阳”、“毛泽东思想是照亮全球的革命灯塔”。
    在我国广州的黄埔港和上海、青岛等地，每年接待数以万计的各国海员。他们语言不同，肤色不一，但是，一见中国同志便翘起大拇指激情地喊道：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”有的用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    毛主席是世界人民的救星
    来自反帝、反修斗争前哨的阿尔巴尼亚商船“发罗拉”号的船员，在黄埔港观看了我国的大型彩色纪录片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》、《毛主席接见红卫兵和革命师生》。每当毛主席在银幕上出现时，船员们都热烈鼓掌，以最真挚最热烈的感情敬祝毛主席万寿无疆。他们说：毛泽东主席不仅属于中国，而且属于阿尔巴尼亚，属于整个国际共产主义运动和整个世界进步人类。毛主席是中国人民的伟大领袖，中国人民的救星，也是世界人民的伟大领袖，世界人民的救星。
    一位来到上海的日本船员说：毛主席是真正为人民的。我们日本人民热爱毛主席，伟大的毛泽东思想一定会成为日本人民的思想。
    毛里求斯海员奈克来到青岛后，渴望能买到一部外文版《毛泽东选集》，当他的愿望实现后，他激动地说：“我将从这本书里获得真理。”
    来自世界各国的朋友把毛主席比作心中的红太阳。一位荷兰海员一手指着毛主席像，一手指着天空的太阳，然后指指自己的胸口，对中国工作人员说：“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳。中国有伟大的领袖毛主席，中国的朋友遍于全世界。”
    毛主席身体健康是中国人民和世界革命人民最大的幸福，外国海员都热情关心毛主席的健康。一位希腊海员来到青岛后对中国朋友说：“我在天津时从电影上看到毛主席很健康，我买了一幅丝织的毛主席像，要带回希腊去，我要告诉希腊人民，毛主席非常健康。”有两位希腊老海员听到毛主席畅游长江的喜讯时，感到又惊又喜，他们伸起大拇指连声说：“了不起！了不起！我们衷心地希望毛泽东主席身体健康，祝他万寿无疆。”
    有了毛主席，非洲人民就有了希望
    有一次，黄埔港的一位工作人员奉命到一艘停泊在港口的塞浦路斯商船上执行勤务。当他工作完毕正要离船时，一位非洲水手走到他的面前，翘起大拇指说：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”这位非洲水手激动地靠前抚摸中国工作人员胸前佩戴的毛主席像章。中国工作人员懂得了他的意思，便把毛主席像章赠给这位非洲朋友。这位非洲海员高兴极了，同中国同志热烈地拥抱起来，并兴奋地说：“中国的革命给一切正在争取民族独立的国家树立了一个榜样。我们敬爱毛泽东，他是东方升起的红太阳，是进步人类的希望。有了毛主席，我们非洲人民就有了希望。”
    许多来自非洲的海员，对毛主席表现了无限的热爱。有一位摩洛哥海员到上海后对中国朋友说：“我们摩洛哥人民热爱新中国，祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。”许多外国海员到了上海后，最重要的一件事就是希望得到毛主席著作和毛主席像章。当他们胸前戴上了毛主席像章以后，都感到是一件最光荣的事。一艘希腊船来到上海，船上一位外国的轮机员得到一枚毛主席像章，高兴得手舞足蹈。他把得到的各种毛主席像章都佩戴在胸前。他说：“这是中国人民送给我的最珍贵的礼物。毛主席是世界上最伟大的人物，我要戴着它到各国去。”
    把毛泽东思想传向全世界
    来自世界各国的海员，无限热爱毛泽东思想，无限热爱毛主席著作，他们从中国带走毛泽东思想，传向海角天涯，传向全世界。
    来到广州黄埔港的各国海员热烈地赞扬说：“毛主席在伟大的革命实践中天才地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想是综合了国际共产主义运动的新经验，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段，因而是世界革命的指路明灯。”
    各国海员们把毛泽东思想看作是“大海中的灯塔”，是“革命航船上的方向盘”，是“照亮全人类的火炬”。一位来自委内瑞拉的海员说：“毛泽东主席和毛泽东思想，不仅是中国人民的，也是我们拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民的。毛泽东主席的书，我最爱读，它说出了我们劳动人民心里的话，给我们指出了斗争的方向。我们委内瑞拉人民依靠战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想，一定能够赶走美帝国主义，获得真正的民族独立和解放。”
    一位桑给巴尔水手长说：“毛主席的话句句是真理。”另一位桑给巴尔的生火员说：“毛泽东思想是照亮全人类的火炬，是为被压迫的亚非拉人民指示斗争方向的罗盘。我们桑给巴尔人民永远不会忘记毛主席关于‘枪杆子里面出政权’这个著名论断。”
    广大海员带着无限深厚的感情读毛主席的书，他们把毛主席著作看作是无价之宝。英国商船的一位厨师因病在广州留医一个多月，当他病愈出院回国时，他激动地对我国工作人员说：“我非常热爱毛主席，毛主席的书句句是真理。我住院期间读完《毛泽东选集》，学到很多东西。我深深感到它是打倒美帝国主义、粉碎现代修正主义的巨大精神力量，是世界人民革命的强有力的战斗武器。”越南海船“水边”号的三副，在船停泊黄埔港期间，每天都和我国工作人员一起学习《毛主席语录》，他把毛主席著作看作像空气和粮食一样，一刻也离不开毛泽东思想。法国一位海员来到青岛后得到几本毛主席著作，他情不自禁地欢呼：“毛泽东好，毛泽东伟大，法国真正的共产党员和法国人民都热爱毛泽东。”
    在上海和青岛的海员俱乐部里，经常出现外国海员争购毛主席著作的动人情景，他们说，随身携带《毛主席语录》，可以使我们随时受到教益。一位苏丹海员说，苏丹很多人学习毛主席著作，毛主席著作是我们最喜爱的宝书。一位英国海员在青岛刚下船就热情地对我国工作人员说：“毛泽东是最伟大最高尚的人，我最爱读毛泽东的书。”他迫不及待地设法购买了毛主席著作。许多外国海员读了毛主席的书以后，坚定地表示相信：中国人民有了毛泽东思想武装，中国就永远不会变颜色。全世界人民有了毛泽东思想，世界革命就有了希望。
    中国是世界革命的中心
    各国海员来到中国，看到中国的无产阶级文化大革命，看到用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民精神面貌的巨大变化，无不为之感动。
    最近来上海的一位日本海员，亲眼看到了中国文化大革命的情况，他激动地说，这场革命太伟大了，和日本报纸宣传的完全不同。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，中国在毛主席的领导下，已经成了世界革命的中心。
    有些外国海员看到中国人民那种高昂的革命干劲和高尚的道德风貌，常常感动得流泪。有一次，一位芬兰老海员手被烫伤了，在船上得不到治疗，到上海后，一个三轮车工人发现他的手受伤，便劝他到医院治疗，并亲自送他到医院。这件事使他感动得流下了眼泪。这位老海员对比二十年前到上海的情况时激动地说，现在上海是一个革命的城市，中国人民都过着幸福的生活，对我们外国工人这样诚心诚意的帮助，这是毛主席教导的结果。许多外国海员来到上海海员俱乐部里，常常站在毛主席塑像前面，凝视着毛主席慈祥的笑容，久久不愿离开。有些海员还逐字逐句地把墙上的毛主席语录抄下来。他们流露出无限的深情，热爱毛主席，热爱伟大的新中国。（据新华社讯）
