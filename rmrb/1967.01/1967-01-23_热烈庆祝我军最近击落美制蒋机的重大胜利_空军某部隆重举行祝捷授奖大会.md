Celebrating the Major Victory of Our Military in Recently Shooting Down an American-Made KMT Plane
A Certain Unit of the Air Force Holds a Grand Victory Celebration and Award Ceremony

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd, the Air Force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a grand victory celebration and award ceremony in a certain location in East China today to celebrate the major victory of shooting down an American-made KMT F-104 fighter jet on the afternoon of January 13th. At the meeting, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically cheered: This is a brilliant victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and a victory for the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The soldiers and officers of the Air Force unit that severely punished the American and KMT air bandits once again declared that all reactionaries who are extremely terrified and hostile to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, no matter what kind of aircraft they send, how many they send, we will shoot down as many as they send; whenever they come, we will shoot them down whenever they come, and we will resolutely and thoroughly annihilate them.

Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Han Xianchu, as well as leaders from the Fuzhou Military Region, a certain unit of the Air Force, and representatives from local party, government, military, and militia organizations attended the meeting.

The meeting began with the majestic song "The East Is Red." The presider first led everyone to read Chairman Mao's quotations: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles. Even after the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance." "Modesty helps one go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind. We should always bear this in mind." Following this, Vice Chief of the General Staff Han Xianchu read the commendation order issued by the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China to the units that fought in the battle. The leader of the Air Force unit that participated in the battle read the list of units and individuals who were awarded for their merits in this battle and presented the certificates to them one by one. The leader of the local garrison and the leader of the local party and government organizations presented two banners to the units that fought in the battle. At this moment, the venue erupted with waves of cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years!" and enthusiastic applause.

Leaders from the Fuzhou Military Region, Zhu Shaoping, the leader of the participating unit, Wang Zixiang, and the representative of the meritorious personnel, Hu Shouren, spoke at the meeting.

The meeting ended in a victorious atmosphere with the singing of "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and the chanting of battle slogans.

    据新华社二十二日讯　中国人民解放军空军某部，今天在华东某地隆重举行祝捷授奖大会，热烈庆祝一月十三日下午一举击落美制蒋匪帮Ｆ—104型战斗机的重大胜利。会上，人民解放军指战员们热烈地欢呼：这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的光辉胜利，是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。严厉惩罚美蒋飞贼的我空军某部指战员，再一次表示，对我国无产阶级文化大革命极端恐惧和仇视的一切反动派，不管它们派来什么飞机，来多少，我们就打多少；什么时候来，我们就什么时候打，坚决、彻底地消灭它。

    大会在雄壮的《东方红》歌声中开始。会议主持人首先带领全场同志朗读毛主席语录：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”接着，韩先楚副总参谋长宣读中共中央军委颁发给作战有功部队的嘉奖令。空军参战部队负责人宣读了在这次作战中立功受奖的单位和人员的名单，并把奖状一一发给他们。当地驻军负责人和当地党政机关负责人，分别将两面锦旗赠送给作战有功部队。这时，会场上激起一阵又一阵“毛主席万岁，万万岁”的欢呼声和热烈的掌声。
