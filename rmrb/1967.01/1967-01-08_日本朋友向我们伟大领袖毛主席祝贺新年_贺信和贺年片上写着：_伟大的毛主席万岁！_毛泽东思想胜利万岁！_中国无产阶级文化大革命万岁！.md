During the New Year period, friends from various parts of Japan sent greetings to China's great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese people through the Liaozhengzhi Office's liaison office in Tokyo and Chinese journalists stationed in Japan. In their letters and New Year cards, they wrote: "Long live the great Chairman Mao!" "Long live the victory of Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China!"

Japanese friends exchanged New Year cards with each other, writing or printing quotes from Chairman Mao's sayings to inspire themselves and encourage their friends. They are determined to overcome the sabotage by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and modern revisionists and to promote the genuine Japan-China friendship movement.

The Central Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) printed Chairman Mao's words "A single spark can start a prairie fire" on their New Year cards sent to members. The Osaka Prefecture Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) printed Chairman Mao's quote "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" in both Japanese and Chinese on their New Year cards.

An educator from Kagoshima City wrote Chairman Mao's saying on the New Year cards given to friends: "The world is progressing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone. We should always propagate to the people the progressive situation of the world and the bright future, so that the people can build up the confidence of victory."

The preparatory committee head of the Kyoto Prefecture (Genuine) Japan-China Friendship Association, Kong Tianliang, used Chairman Mao's words "We are not alone; all the countries and peoples in the world that oppose imperialism are our friends" to encourage friends who maintain genuine Japan-China friendship to strive together.
