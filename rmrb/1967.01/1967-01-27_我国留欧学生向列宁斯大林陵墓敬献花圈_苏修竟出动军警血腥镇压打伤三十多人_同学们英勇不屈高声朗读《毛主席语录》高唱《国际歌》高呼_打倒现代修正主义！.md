Chinese students studying in Europe pay respects to Lenin and Stalin's mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square. The Soviet revisionists brutally suppress them, injuring over 30 people. The students bravely read "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sing "The Internationale," and shout "Down with modern revisionism!"

	MOSCOW, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) — At 12:45 p.m. on January 25, 69 Chinese students studying in Europe, while on their way back to China to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, were brutally suppressed by a large number of Soviet military police and plainclothes agents while paying their respects to Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square. This resulted in a serious bloodshed incident in Red Square, a premeditated fascist atrocity by the Soviet authorities against Chinese students, and further evidence of the Soviet revisionist leadership's open betrayal of Leninism.

	The Chinese students, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, hold deep revolutionary feelings for the great leader and teacher of the world proletarian revolution, Lenin, the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin, and the great Soviet people. They decided to pay their respects to Lenin and Stalin's mausoleums before leaving Moscow. The two wreaths read: "In memory of the great leader and teacher of the proletarian revolution, V.I. Lenin," and "In memory of the great Marxist-Leninist, J.V. Stalin."

	On January 25, after notifying the relevant Soviet authorities through the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, the Chinese students carried the wreaths and headed to Red Square by car. Initially, a Soviet army major and several police officers led the Chinese students into Red Square. Hundreds of military police and plainclothes agents were stationed behind the Chinese students.

	The Chinese students marched in an orderly manner to Lenin's mausoleum, placed the wreaths at the entrance, and stood in silence with their hats off. After the moment of silence, as a student was about to lead the reading of Chairman Mao's quotations, two Soviet police officers forcibly dragged him away. The students then read aloud the following quotation from Chairman Mao: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law independent of man's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will definitely triumph, whether sooner or later."

	The Chinese students continued to read another quotation from Chairman Mao: "Stalin is a faithful friend of the Chinese people's liberation cause. The Chinese people's love for Stalin and friendship with the Soviet Union are sincere. No amount of slander and defamation by anyone can change this."

	As they read the quotations, a Soviet army major led the obstruction, pushing and pulling the Chinese female students. The Chinese students then sang "The Internationale" in unison. At this point, the Soviet army major signaled to a large number of armed Soviet police and plainclothes agents who had been positioned behind the Chinese students. They rushed forward, encircled the Chinese students, the accompanying personnel from the Chinese Embassy, and the Xinhua News Agency reporters, beating and kicking them. Some had concealed weapons, and others punched the Chinese students in the face. Immediately, many Chinese students and embassy personnel, as well as Xinhua reporters, were beaten bloody, with blood covering their faces. Despite this, the Chinese students, holding hands, sang "The Internationale" to the end. The Soviet military police and plainclothes agents stomped on the Chinese students, tore their clothes, broke their glasses, and stole their belongings. Many female students were knocked to the ground and could not stand up. Preliminary statistics show that over 30 Chinese comrades were injured, with more than a dozen bleeding and four in critical condition. Four were knocked unconscious on the spot, with Huang Jian suffering a broken rib on the right side and difficulty breathing, putting his life in danger. The accompanying personnel from the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union and the Xinhua reporters were also severely beaten, with some sustaining injuries to their faces or legs.

	After the Soviet military police and plainclothes agents began their brutal suppression of the Chinese students, embassy personnel, and Xinhua reporters, many Soviet people gathered in Red Square. Some shouted, "Don't hit them!" Others sympathized and waved enthusiastically to the Chinese students, expressing their support. Some elderly people stood by, shedding tears.

	At this time, the unarmed Chinese students held hands and shouted slogans: "Long live the great Lenin!" "Long live Leninism!" "Long live Stalin!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" "Down with modern revisionism!" They read aloud Chairman Mao's quotation: "Resolutely take a stand, be fearless of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." A Soviet police officer violently snatched a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from a Chinese student and attempted to trample it with his feet. However, the Chinese student bravely fought back, determined to protect Chairman Mao's precious book and prevent it from being desecrated by the Soviet military police.

	The Chinese students were beaten by the Soviet military police and plainclothes agents, led by a Soviet colonel and major, for half an hour in Moscow's Red Square. As a result, they did not even get to see Lenin's remains. What is even more infuriating is that the Soviet plainclothes agents trampled and destroyed the wreath the Chinese students had prepared for Lenin. The wreath intended for Stalin was never placed at his mausoleum, and its whereabouts are unknown.

	After the Chinese students were beaten, the representative from the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union who accompanied the wreath presentation immediately protested to the Soviet military police on the spot. The Soviet military police had no response in the face of the ironclad facts.

	The brutal suppression of Chinese students studying in Europe by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents is further evidence of the Soviet revisionist leadership's betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. It is another manifestation of their hatred and fear of the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought and their hostility towards the Chinese people. This incident will undoubtedly arouse the intense indignation of the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and revolutionary people around the world.

　　我国留欧学生向列宁斯大林陵墓敬献花圈
　　苏修竟出动军警血腥镇压打伤三十多人
　　同学们英勇不屈高声朗读《毛主席语录》高唱《国际歌》高呼“打倒现代修正主义！”
    新华社莫斯科二十五日电　一月二十五日中午十二时四十五分，我国六十九名留欧学生在向莫斯科红场列宁陵墓敬献花圈时，竟然遭到苏联大批军警和便衣特务的血腥镇压，造成了极其严重的红场流血事件。这是苏联当局预谋的骇人听闻的镇压中国学生的法西斯暴行，是苏联现代修正主义领导集团公开背叛列宁主义的又一铁证。
    我国留欧学生是在回国参加无产阶级文化大革命时路经莫斯科的。
    中国留欧学生遵照中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的教导，对世界无产阶级革命的伟大领袖和导师列宁，对伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林，对伟大的苏联人民怀有深厚的革命感情。他们决定在离开莫斯科前向列宁和斯大林的陵墓敬献花圈。两个花圈上分别写着：“献给无产阶级革命的伟大领袖和导师弗·伊·列宁”，“献给伟大的马克思列宁主义者约·维·斯大林”。
    二十五日中午，中国学生经由中国驻苏联大使馆通知苏联有关当局后，携带花圈乘车前往红场。起先，一名苏军少校和数名警察把中国学生们带入红场。在中国学生队伍的后面布置了数百名军警和便衣特务。
    中国学生秩序井然地列队走到列宁墓前，把花圈放在列宁墓的入口处，并全体脱帽默哀。默哀后，一位同学正要带头朗读中国人民伟大领袖毛主席语录时，苏联两名警察就把这位同学强行架走。同学们接着就齐声朗读毛主席的语录：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    中国学生继续朗读毛主席的一段话：“斯大林是中国人民解放事业的忠实的朋友。中国人民对于斯大林的敬爱，对于苏联的友谊，是完全出于诚意的，任何人的挑拨离间，造谣污蔑，到底都没有用处。”
    他们在朗读语录时，一名苏军少校带头阻挠，并且推、拉中国女学生。中国学生有秩序地高声齐唱《国际歌》。这时，苏军少校向大批苏联武装警察和早已布置在中国学生身后的便衣特务招手。这些人一拥而上，强行把中国学生和中国大使馆的陪同人员以及新华社记者重重地包围起来，拳打脚踢，乱打乱撞；他们有的手握暗器，有的用拳头猛击中国学生的脸部。顿时有很多中国学生和大使馆陪同人员以及新华社记者被打得头部流血，鲜血满面。尽管如此，我国留欧学生手挽着手，坚持唱完《国际歌》。苏联军警和便衣特务用脚把中国学生踩在地上，撕破他们的衣服，打破他们的眼镜，抢走他们的衣物。很多中国女学生被打倒在地，站不起身来。据初步统计，共有三十余名中国同志受伤，其中十余人流血，伤势极为严重的四人。当场被打晕倒的就有四人，其中黄建同同学右侧肋骨被踢伤，呼吸困难，生命处在危险状态中。陪同前往的我国驻苏联大使馆人员和采访的新华社记者均遭毒打，有的面部或腿部被打出血。
    苏联军警和便衣特务对中国学生、中国使馆人员和新华社记者血腥镇压开始后，很多苏联人民围在红场上，有的人高喊：“不能打，不能打他们啊！”有的人同情地向中国学生热情挥手，表示支持。有的老人站在一旁流泪。
    这时，手无寸铁的中国学生们手拉着手，高呼口号：“伟大的列宁万岁！”“列宁主义万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”“中苏两国人民的友谊万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”“打倒现代修正主义！”他们高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”苏联一名警察用暴力从中国学生手中抢去一本《毛主席语录》，并企图用脚加以践踏。但是，中国同学奋不顾身，拚全力把这本红彤彤的宝书夺回。他当时唯一的想法就是：“誓死保卫毛主席的宝书，绝不让它被苏联军警沾污”。
    中国学生在莫斯科红场上整整被由苏联一名中校和一名少校指挥下的苏联军警和便衣特务殴打达半小时之久。结果，中国学生连列宁的遗容都未能瞻仰到。更令人气愤的是，苏联便衣人员竟然把我国学生敬献给列宁的花圈踏坏。中国学生准备献给斯大林的花圈更未能放置在斯大林墓前，花圈下落不明。
    中国学生被殴打后，陪同献花圈的我国驻苏联大使馆代表当场即向苏联军警提出了最强烈的抗议。苏联军警在铁的事实面前，无言以对。
    苏联军警和便衣特务对中国留欧学生的这一血腥镇压事件，是苏联修正主义领导集团背叛马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的又一铁证，是他们痛恨和惧怕毛泽东思想的伟大影响、仇视中国人民的又一表现。这一事件必将激起中国人民、苏联人民以及全世界革命人民的无比愤慨。
