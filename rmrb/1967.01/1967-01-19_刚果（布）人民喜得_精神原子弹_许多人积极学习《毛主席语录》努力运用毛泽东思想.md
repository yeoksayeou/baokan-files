The people of Congo (Brazzaville) living by the Congo River in Africa often think of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and sincerely express their deep affection for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Whenever they see a Chinese person, they cheer for the great name of Mao Zedong. When they receive a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" or works by Chairman Mao, they treasure it as a precious treasure, read it carefully, and gradually apply it to their work and struggle. Such examples are not only found in the capital but also in remote towns covered by ancient forests.

This New Year, many Congolese friends, upon seeing Chinese friends, would say as their first words: "Happy New Year to Chairman Mao!" They also said, "Please convey my warm greetings to Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao good health and longevity forever!" A friend received a New Year's card with a quote from Chairman Mao, and immediately expressed to the Chinese friend: "This is the greatest encouragement I received during the New Year. I will always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings." A militia captain received a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on New Year's Eve and joyfully told the Chinese friend: "This is the most precious gift of the New Year. When I heard the news of China's recent successful nuclear test, I was very happy. Now I have obtained this 'spiritual atomic bomb,' and I am even more excited. I thank Chairman Mao. I feel full of strength!"

A primary school principal, after receiving a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in bright red, would read it eagerly every night until late, marking various notes on the pages. His wife is a leader of a women's organization. Every night, when her husband goes to school to teach during the day, she would pick up this "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read it carefully, also marking various notes on the pages. The primary school principal told the Chinese friend: "When we read this revolutionary treasure together, we feel extremely happy. Chairman Mao's great thoughts have captured the hearts of our entire family."

The youth members of the 15th branch of the National Revolutionary Movement of Congo (Brazzaville) have long been committed to studying the works of Chairman Mao. They gather every Friday to study. In the past, they did not have a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," so they often had to copy a couple of Chairman Mao's quotes on the blackboard and study together. Recently, they obtained the long-awaited red book of Chairman Mao. The 21 youth members immediately organized a study session on the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," especially selecting two quotes from the sections "Serve the People" and "Self-Reliance and Arduous Struggle," and recited them repeatedly.

The revolutionary people of Congo (Brazzaville) love to read Chairman Mao's books. The picture shows the youth of Congo (Brazzaville) studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with great concentration, seeking revolutionary truths from it.

    刚果（布）人民喜得“精神原子弹”
    许多人积极学习《毛主席语录》努力运用毛泽东思想
    据新华社讯　住在非洲刚果河畔的刚果（布）人民，经常想念着世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，真诚地流露出他们心底深处对毛主席和毛泽东思想的热爱。他们一见到中国人就欢呼毛泽东这个伟大的名字；当他们得到一本《毛主席语录》或毛主席著作时，就如获至宝，认真阅读，并逐步联系和应用到自己的工作和斗争中去。这种事例不仅在首都有，而且在偏远的、被古老森林覆盖着的小镇里也有。
    今年新年，许多刚果（布）朋友一见到中国朋友，第一句话就是：“向毛主席恭贺新年！”他们还说：“请你转达我对毛主席的亲切问候！”“祝毛主席身体永远健康和长寿！”
    一位友人接到了一张上面写有毛主席语录的贺年片，立即向中国友人表示：这是新年期间他所得到的最大鼓励，他要永远记住毛主席的伟大教导。一位民兵队长在新年前夕得到一本《毛主席语录》，兴高采烈地向中国朋友说：“这是新年中最宝贵的礼物。当我听到中国最近一次核爆炸成功的消息时，高兴得很，现在我又得到了这颗‘精神原子弹’，更是无比兴奋。我感谢毛主席，我感到浑身都是力量！”
    一位小学校长在得到一本红光闪闪的法文版《毛主席语录》以后，每天如饥似渴、手不释卷地读到深夜，并在书页上划满了各种记号。他的妻子是一个妇女组织的负责人。她每天晚上到家庭妇女中做工作，因此当她的丈夫白天去学校上课时，她就拿起这本《毛主席语录》读起来，并且读得非常专心，在书页上也划满了各种记号。这位小学校长对中国朋友说：“当我们共同读着这本革命宝书时，我们感到无比的幸福。毛主席伟大的思想，把我们一家的心都抓住了。”
    刚果（布）全国革命运动第十五支部的青年成员们，长期坚持学习毛主席著作。他们每逢星期五集合在一起学习。过去，他们没有一本《毛主席语录》，常常只好把毛主席的一两条语录抄在黑板上，一起学习。最近，他们获得了渴望已久的毛主席的红书。二十一个青年成员立即组织学习一次《毛主席语录》，他们特别在“为人民服务”和“自力更生，艰苦奋斗”的两部分中，选了两条语录，反复念几遍。
