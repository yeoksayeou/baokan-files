The greeting from Albanian comrades has greatly encouraged Shanghai revolutionary rebels. Let all revolutionary factions around the world unite to overthrow imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. Let us strive to create a bright red new world.

	Shanghai revolutionary masses are determined to press forward and firmly grasp political, economic, and cultural power, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	New China News Agency, Shanghai, January 18 — Shanghai workers and revolutionary masses, after reading the greeting from Albanian comrades on January 14, felt immense joy and encouragement. They expressed that they must unite more closely under the banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, heighten their vigilance, continue to press forward, and thoroughly defeat any plots and counterattacks by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. They must strongly oppose imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and strive to create a bright red new world.

	The workers of Albania, standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, recently held a rally and sent a greeting, firmly supporting the revolutionary actions of Shanghai revolutionary rebels in striking back against the bourgeois reactionary line. This has brought great encouragement and strength to the Shanghai revolutionary rebels. Shanghai workers and revolutionary masses expressed that they will continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve great unity and great alliance, seize political, economic, and cultural power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the stubborn elements adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly grasp it in their own hands; resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end, making beneficial contributions to the international proletarian revolutionary cause.

	The news of Albanian comrades supporting Shanghai revolutionary rebels has sparked a strong response among Shanghai revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses. After seeing this news in the newspapers, the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 32 other revolutionary rebel organizations, along with revolutionary masses, were all filled with joy. Some held discussions and study sessions, some wrote articles for the newspaper, and some sent telegrams and letters to Albanian worker comrades, enthusiastically praising the heroic Albanian people for their splendid achievements under the leadership of the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and their significant contributions in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. They expressed their determination to learn from the unyielding and tenacious fighting spirit of the Albanian comrades.

	Shanghai revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses deeply felt that the enthusiastic support from Albanian worker comrades, filled with internationalist spirit, has set a good example for the great alliance of international proletarian revolutionaries. The soldiers of the Shanghai Workers' Northward Returning Second Brigade, determined to unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp political, economic, and cultural power, and establish a new order for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The old workers of the Dongfanghong Film Collective Dongfanghong United Combat Team said that the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary factions would be invincible. Relying on unity, they seized power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, ensuring that the power of the film studio is firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary factions. They are determined to have a global vision and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end, striving to make contributions to the world's revolutionary people. Shanghai revolutionary rebel soldiers firmly believe that with the enthusiastic support of Albanian comrades, with the great alliance of the working classes of China and Albania, and with the great alliance of the world proletariat, we will surely be able to thoroughly uproot the roots of capitalism and revisionism, ensure that the socialist mountains will never change color, and achieve victory in the world revolution.

	Shanghai workers and revolutionary masses deeply understand that "grasp revolution, promote production" is the key issue in the current Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. They are determined to fully implement the policies proposed in the "Emergency Notice," and with concrete actions to thoroughly defeat revolutionary revisionist economism, to repay the enthusiastic support from Albanian workers. The soldiers of the Shanghai Workers' Northward Returning Third Brigade, after defeating the black wind of economism, have always firmly guarded their work positions and completed the tasks assigned by the state. The revolutionary rebel workers and revolutionary masses of the Shanghai Port Bureau's Fifth District, who frequently send materials to brother Albania, were particularly excited upon hearing the news. They joyfully held a discussion meeting, cheering "Long live Sino-Albanian friendship!" In resolutely implementing the "Notice to All People of Shanghai" and the "Emergency Notice," the workers of the Fifth District not only repelled the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line and smashed the plot of "port shutdown," but also created the miracle of completing 2,000 tons of production tasks in one day. On January 17, the revolutionary rebel team of the Fifth District wrote a passionate letter to the workers of four units, including the Berat Mao Zedong Textile Joint Venture in Albania, expressing their determination to shoulder both the burdens of revolution and production, and to respond to the congratulations from Albanian comrades with greater production achievements.

    全世界革命派联合起来打倒帝修反
    为创造一个红彤彤的新世界奋斗到底
    上海革命群众决心乘胜前进，牢牢掌握政治经济文化大权，把文化大革命进行到底
    新华社上海十八日电　上海工人和革命群众读了阿尔巴尼亚兄弟十四日的贺信后，感到无限欢欣鼓舞，他们纷纷表示：我们一定要更紧密地团结在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的旗帜下，提高警惕，继续乘胜追击，彻底击败党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的任何阴谋和反扑，要更坚强有力地大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造各国反动派的反，为反出一个红彤彤的新世界而奋斗到底。
    站在反帝反修最前线的亲密战友——阿尔巴尼亚工人，最近举行集会并发来贺信，坚决支持上海革命造反派迎头痛击资产阶级反动路线的革命行动，给上海革命造反派带来巨大的鼓舞和力量。上海工人阶级和广大革命群众表示，要继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，实行大团结大联合，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手中，把政治、经济、文化的大权夺过来，牢牢地掌握在自己手里；坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为国际无产阶级革命事业作出有益的贡献。
    兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民支持上海革命造反派的喜讯，在上海革命造反派和广大革命群众中引起了强烈的反应。上海工人革命造反总司令部等三十二个革命造反团体和广大革命群众，在报纸上看到这个喜讯后，都欢欣鼓舞，有的举行座谈、学习，有的给报社写文章，有的给阿尔巴尼亚工人兄弟发出电报和信件，热情赞扬英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志领导下取得的辉煌成就，热情赞扬他们在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义斗争中作出的重大贡献，表示要学习他们不屈不挠、顽强战斗的革命精神。
    上海革命造反派和革命群众深深感到，阿尔巴尼亚工人兄弟充满国际主义精神的热情支持，为国际无产阶级革命派大联合作出了良好的开端。上海工人北上返沪第二兵团的战士们，决心在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下联合起来，牢牢掌握住政治、经济、文化的大权，建立无产阶级文化大革命的新秩序。东方红电影公社东方红联合战斗队的老工人们说，实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，就能无敌于天下。他们依靠联合，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，使电影制片厂的大权牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，他们决心胸怀世界，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，努力为世界革命人民作出贡献。上海革命造反派战士们坚信，有了阿尔巴尼亚战友的热情支持，有了中阿两国工人阶级的大联合，有了世界无产阶级的大联合，我们就一定能彻底挖掉资本主义和修正主义根子，保证社会主义江山永不变色，取得世界革命的胜利。
    上海工人阶级和广大革命群众深刻认识到“抓革命，促生产”是当前无产阶级文化大革命的关键问题，决心不折不扣地贯彻执行《紧急通告》提出的各项政策，以彻底打倒反革命修正主义的经济主义的实际行动，来答谢阿尔巴尼亚工人对自己的热情支持。上海工人北上返沪第三兵团的战士们，在击溃经济主义的黑风后，始终坚守工作岗位，完成了国家交给的任务。经常为兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚输送物资的上海港务局五区的革命造反派工人和革命群众，闻讯后特别兴奋，他们兴高采烈地举行了座谈会，欢呼“中阿友谊万岁！”在坚决贯彻执行《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》中，五区工人不仅打退了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，粉碎了“海港停工”的阴谋，而且创造了一天超额完成二千吨生产任务的奇迹。十七日，五区的工人革命造反队给阿尔巴尼亚培拉特毛泽东纺织联合工厂等四个单位的职工，写了一封热情洋溢的信，表示一定要挑好革命、生产两副担子，以更大的生产成绩来回答阿尔巴尼亚兄弟的祝贺。
