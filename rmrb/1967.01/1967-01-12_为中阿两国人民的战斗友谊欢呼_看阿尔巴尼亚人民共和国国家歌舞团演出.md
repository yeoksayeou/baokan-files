The brotherly Albanian People's Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble, carrying the deep affection of the Albanian Labor Party and its people, has come to our country for a friendly visit. We, with the comradeship of a fighting friendship, extend our warmest welcome to the comrades and messengers from the land of the eagle.

The ensemble has successfully performed several times in our country. All the audience members watched the performance with excitement, cheering for the ensemble's powerful and nationally distinctive performance. The entire performance was conducted in a very enthusiastic atmosphere, receiving thunderous applause.

The first item, a chorus, took us into the ocean of friendship, immersing us in the warm currents of camaraderie. The performers, with their warm and resonant voices, sang the song "Praise to the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha," and then in Chinese, they enthusiastically sang the song praising our great leader Chairman Mao: "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." The performers' deep reverence for the leader resonated strongly with the entire audience. Later, when the performers sang "The Song of Red Friendship" with deep emotion, the audience's and performers' feelings became even more tightly bound together. The great friendship between the peoples of China and Albania is the fruit of our common struggle, forged and personally created by the great leaders of our two countries, Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha. As Chairman Mao said, "The Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Albania, the peoples of China and Albania, have forged a deep revolutionary friendship in the course of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. This friendship is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and it is eternal and unbreakable."

From the ensemble's performance, we saw the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress of the Albanian people in their socialist revolution and construction. We are delighted by every great victory achieved by our Albanian comrades. Especially when the chorus sang "Praising the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party," from that powerful and confident song, we heard the voice of the Albanian people striving to achieve the political tasks and grand programs proposed by the Labor Party. We saw that socialist Albania is advancing along the path opened by the Labor Party, holding high the revolutionary red flag of "One hand with a hoe, one hand with a gun."

The heroic Albanian people, under the strong leadership of the Labor Party, in the face of the encirclement by imperialism and modern revisionism, fearlessly and bravely smashed the blockade and savage attacks of American imperialism and the modern revisionism of Khrushchev and Tito, and heroically defended socialist Albania. A member of the ensemble from a farming collective, with boundless love for her country and deep hatred for the enemy, sang "The Conspiracy of Revisionism Has Failed," fully expressing the indomitable revolutionary spirit and heroic courage of the Albanian people. "The Dance of the Guerrillas" showed the vigorous and gallant posture of today's Albanian people, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, advancing along the path of extreme revolution, following in the footsteps of the revolutionary forebears. Heroic Albania, like a nimble eagle, stands on the rocks of the Adriatic coast, vigilantly watching all invading enemies with its keen eyes. As our great leader Chairman Mao said, "Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the glorious Albanian Labor Party firmly holds high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism amidst the encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism. Heroic Albania has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe."

Albania, with its lofty spirit of proletarian internationalism, while achieving great success in its own country, never forgets its responsibility to support the revolutionary struggles of brotherly countries. In the international communist movement, it has faithfully fulfilled its proletarian internationalist duties. The chorus "To the Heroes of Vietnam" fully expressed the Albanian people's strong hatred for American imperialism and their powerful support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. We were deeply moved by the Albanian people's high internationalist spirit.

The Albanian Labor Party, which holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, attaches great importance to the education of revolutionary traditions and is leading a profound cultural revolution. In the cities and mountains of Albania, revolutionary songs can be heard everywhere. The Albanian people inspire themselves with revolutionary songs. Today, when we hear the revolutionary traditional songs of Albania, "The Guerrillas Are Marching," "Singing the Guerrillas," and "The Eagle of the Guerrillas," we cannot help but recall the scenes from our visit and performance in the land of the eagle in July 1966, when we were with the old guerrillas. An elderly man over seventy said to us, "I still have a gun at home, it is the gun I used during the guerrilla days, now I am ready to take up the gun at any time to answer the call of the motherland and eliminate all invading enemies!" From the conversation, we learned about the glorious fighting history of the Albanian people and felt the vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm of the revolutionary forebears. He set a shining example for us young people and gave us great education.

When the evening reached its climax, a male soloist wearing a red armband of our Red Guards and holding high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" appeared before us, immediately the theater erupted in thunderous applause. In the atmosphere of intense emotion, the performer sang the song of Mao's quotations with great passion: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party...", fully expressing the Albanian people's boundless love for Chairman Mao's works and their boundless reverence for the invincible great thought of Mao Zedong. Under the sincere emotion of the Albanian performers, the entire audience could not help but sing along.

The ensemble also performed "The Dance of Friendship." As the dance began, the stage showed workers, peasants, soldiers, and students from China and Albania dancing arm in arm under the red flags of the two countries. The performers, with full enthusiasm and agile, joyful dance steps, vividly depicted the great friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, united under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, learning from each other, supporting each other, helping each other, and fighting shoulder to shoulder. Our great leader Chairman Mao said well, "Though separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected." When the curtain showed the portraits of our great leader Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the entire audience erupted, and the stage and audience echoed with the enthusiastic cheers of "Mao Zedong—Enver" and "Enver—Mao Zedong." These cheers signified the great power of our friendship and the reliable guarantee of our friendship.

Since its establishment in 1957, the Albanian People's Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble has always maintained close ties with the people, consistently adhering to the principle of serving the laboring masses and the revolutionary cause. This ensemble is from the people and serves the people. It is deeply loved by its own people at home and has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of more than ten countries in Asia and Europe during its visits and performances. Today, when they visit our country for the second time, the ensemble has taken a new step on the path of revolutionization. Here, we express our heartfelt thanks to the Albanian People's Republic National Song and Dance Ensemble for crossing thousands of mountains and rivers to bring such precious fighting friendship and revolutionary art to the Chinese people.

Long live the fighting friendship between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of Albania, the peoples of China and Albania!

    为中阿两国人民的战斗友谊欢呼
    ——看阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国家歌舞团演出
    战友
    兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国家歌舞团，满载着阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民的深情厚谊，来到我国进行友好访问。我们怀着同志般的战斗友谊，对来自山鹰之国的战友和使者，表示最热烈的欢迎。
    歌舞团在我国成功地举行了几次演出。所有的观众，都怀着激动的心情，为歌舞团的充满战斗性的、富有民族特色的精彩演出而欢欣鼓舞。整个演出是在十分热烈的气氛中进行的，赢得了雷动般的掌声。
    第一个节目合唱，把我们带入了友谊的海洋，使我们沉浸在友谊的暖流中。演员们用亲切洪亮的声音，演唱了《歌颂党和恩维尔·霍查同志》的歌曲，又用中文热情爽朗地演唱了歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲——《大海航行靠舵手》。演员们对领袖无限敬仰的深情，激起了全场观众的强烈共鸣。随后，当演员们怀着深挚的感情，唱起《红色友谊之歌》的时候，观众和演员的感情，就更加紧紧地凝结在一起了。中阿两国人民之间的伟大友谊，是我们共同战斗的结晶，是我们两国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志与恩维尔·霍查同志，共同锤炼和亲手缔造的。正如毛主席所说的：“中阿两党、两国人民，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，结成了深厚的革命友谊。这种友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的，是永恒的、牢不可破的。”
    从歌舞团演出的节目里，我们看到了阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命和建设中自力更生和奋发图强的革命精神，我们为阿尔巴尼亚同志所取得的每一个巨大胜利而高兴。特别是当合唱队员高唱《歌颂劳动党第五次代表大会》这首歌时，从那雄壮有力而又充满信心的歌声里，我们听到了阿尔巴尼亚人民为实现劳动党所提出的政治任务和宏伟纲领的心声，我们看到了社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚，正沿着劳动党开辟的大道，高举着“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的革命红旗，奋勇前进。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党的坚强领导下，面对着帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围，不畏强暴、排除万难，粉碎了美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫、铁托现代修正主义的封锁和猖狂攻击，英勇地捍卫了社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚。歌舞团的一位来自农业社的女社员，怀着对祖国无限热爱，对敌人极度仇视的感情，演唱了《修正主义者的阴谋破产了》，这充分表达了阿尔巴尼亚人民百折不挠的革命精神和大无畏的英雄气概。《游击队之舞》则表现了今天的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，正踏着革命先辈们的足迹，朝着非常革命化的大道前进着的飒爽英姿。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，像一只矫健的山鹰，耸立在亚得里亚海岸的岩石上，用她那敏锐的目光，警惕地注视着一切来犯的敌人。正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所说的：“以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，在帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围之中，坚定地高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗。英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”
    具有崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神的阿尔巴尼亚，在自己的国家取得了伟大成就的时候，时刻不忘支援兄弟国家革命斗争的责任，在国际共产主义运动中，忠实地履行了自己的无产阶级国际主义义务。合唱《致英雄的越南》，充分地表达了阿尔巴尼亚人民对美帝国主义的强烈仇恨，以及对越南人民进行抗美救国正义斗争的有力支持。我们被阿尔巴尼亚人民高度的国际主义精神所深深激动着。
    高举着马克思列宁主义大旗的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，极其重视革命传统的教育，正在领导着一场深入的思想文化革命。在阿尔巴尼亚的城市和山区，到处可以听到高昂的革命歌曲，阿尔巴尼亚人民用革命的歌声激励着自己前进。今天，当我们再次听到阿尔巴尼亚的革命传统歌曲《游击队在行进》、《歌唱游击队》《游击队之鹰》的时候，我们情不自禁地回忆起一九六六年七月间在山鹰之国访问演出时和那些老游击队员在一起的情景。曾有一位七十多岁的老人对我们说：“我家里还有一枝枪，那是我打游击时的枪，现在我要随时准备听从祖国的召唤，拿起枪来，去消灭一切来犯的敌人！”从谈话里，我们知道了阿尔巴尼亚人民光荣的战斗经历，感受到了革命老前辈们旺盛的革命热情。他给我们青年人树立了光辉的榜样，也给了我们极大的教育。
    当晚会进入高潮，男声独唱演员佩戴着我国红卫兵的红色袖章，手中高举着《毛主席语录》出现在我们面前时，顿时剧场里响起了暴风雨般的掌声。在观众情绪激昂的气氛中，演员充满激情地演唱了毛主席语录歌：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党……”，充分地表达了阿尔巴尼亚人民对毛主席著作的无限热爱，对战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想的无限敬仰。在阿尔巴尼亚演员这种极为诚挚的感情的鼓舞下，全场观众情不自禁地同声合唱起来了。
    歌舞团还演出了《友谊之舞》。舞蹈一开始，舞台上出现了中阿两国的工人、农民、士兵、学生在中阿两国鲜红的国旗下挽臂欢舞的动人情景。演员们以饱满的热情，矫健欢快的舞蹈步伐，生动地表现了中阿两国人民共同团结在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，互相学习，互相支持，互相帮助，并肩战斗的伟大友谊。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说得好：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”当天幕上出现了我们伟大的领袖毛泽东和恩维尔·霍查同志的画像时，全场沸腾起来，这时台上台下响彻了“毛泽东—恩维尔”“恩维尔—毛泽东”的热烈欢呼声。这种欢呼声标志着我们友谊的巨大力量，标志着我们友谊的可靠保证。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国家歌舞团从一九五七年成立以来，始终和人民群众保持着密切的联系，一贯地坚持着为劳动群众服务、为革命事业服务的准则。这个歌舞团是来自于人民、服务于人民的。她在国内深受本国人民的喜爱，在历经亚洲、欧洲十多个国家的访问演出中，也深受这些国家的革命人民的欢迎。今天当他们第二次来到我们国家时，歌舞团在革命化的大路上，又迈进了新的一步。在这里，我们对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国家歌舞团越过千山万水，为中国人民带来了这样珍贵的战斗友谊和革命的艺术表示衷心的感谢。
    祝中阿两党、两国人民的战斗友谊万古长青！
