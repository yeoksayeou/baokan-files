The American people will not fight for the war of aggression in Vietnam

Refusing conscription, unafraid of imprisonment

According to a report by the American bi-weekly newspaper *Challenge*, James Boyd, a 19-year-old black high school student from New York, recently publicly declared his refusal to be drafted into the military. He is willing to go to prison for this. He condemned the United States' actions in Vietnam as an "unjust, illegal, and immoral" war and declared that he would not act as a "paid killer" for the Johnson administration to kill his Vietnamese brothers.

Hunger strike in protest of arrests

On December 15 of last year, more than a hundred young men and women in New York City demonstrated outside the city's draft office against the war in Vietnam. They carried signs with slogans such as "Protest the bombing of Hanoi" and marched in protest. The reactionary authorities dispatched military police and five police cars to suppress the demonstration, arresting 60 people, including 81-year-old peace movement leader Most. A young woman named Susan Williams began a hunger strike on the day of her arrest to protest the police brutality.

Burn the draft cards!

According to a report by the American weekly *National Guardian*, in the black communities of the northern and southern United States, more and more black youths are joining the movement to resist military service and becoming cannon fodder for the U.S. war in Vietnam.

In New York, an American black youth named Gibbs burned his draft card. In a letter to the draft board, he wrote, "I burned it... I declare that I have no intention of joining the white man's army." He stated his refusal to participate in the "white man's slaughter" and his intention to stay in the country to fight for the rights of blacks.

An 80-kilometer march against the war in Vietnam

Twenty university students from ten colleges in Ohio recently held a meeting in Akron City to oppose the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam. After the meeting, they began an 80-kilometer march from Akron to Cleveland to protest the war in Vietnam. Along the way, more demonstrators joined their ranks.

    美国人民不为侵越战争卖命
    反对征兵，不怕坐牢
    据美国《挑战》双周报报道，十九岁的纽约黑人中学生詹姆斯·博伊德，不久前公开宣布拒绝应征入伍，即使为此坐牢也在所不惜。他谴责美国在越南进行的是一场“不正义、不合法和不道德”的战争，表示决不替约翰逊政府充当“拿饷的杀人犯”去杀害自己的越南兄弟。
    绝食斗争，抗议逮捕
    纽约市上百名男女青年去年十二月十五日在市内征兵总站外面举行反侵越战争示威。他们高举“抗议轰炸河内”等反战标语牌，进行游行。反动当局出动军警和五辆警车前往镇压，逮捕了六十人，其中包括八十一岁的和平运动领袖莫斯特。一位名叫苏赞·威廉斯的年轻姑娘在被捕的当天开始了绝食斗争，以表示她对警察暴行的强烈抗议。
    把征兵证烧掉！
    据美国《国民前卫》周刊报道，在美国北部和南部的黑人聚居区，愈来愈多的黑人青年正在投入反对服兵役、充当美国侵越炮灰的运动。
    在纽约，一个美国黑人青年吉本斯焚烧了他的征兵证。他在写给征兵局的信中说，“我烧掉了它……我要宣告，我无意参加白人的军队”。他表示拒绝参加“白人的屠杀”，而要留在国内为黑人的权利战斗。
    八十公里反侵越“进军”
    来自美国俄亥俄州十所高等院校的二十名大学生，不久前在阿克伦城举行集会，反对美国侵略越南的战争。会后，他们开始了从阿克伦到克利夫兰的八十公里反侵越战争“进军”。沿途不断有新的示威者加入他们的行列。
