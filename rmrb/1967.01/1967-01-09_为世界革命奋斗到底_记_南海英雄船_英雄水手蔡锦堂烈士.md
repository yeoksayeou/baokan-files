On the morning of August 29 last year, when the cargo ship No. 1018 was sailing on its normal route in the Gulf of Tonkin, American air pirates suddenly launched a savage attack on our ship. As soon as the alarm sounded, Cai Jintang rushed to the observation post and stood firmly on his battle station, closely monitoring the enemy aircraft.

The American bandits circled and dived for a while before starting their barbaric bombing and strafing. Cai Jintang, filled with rage, waved his fists and, together with all the comrades on the ship, engaged in a fierce struggle with the enemy aircraft. He accurately reported the movements of the enemy aircraft, helping the cargo ship to avoid several attacks. Just as the battle reached its climax, a shrapnel suddenly pierced Cai Jintang's body. Even as he lay dying, he kept his fists clenched and his eyes fixed on the American bandits, as if shouting: "American imperialism is the enemy of all the people of the world, fight! Fight! Fight!"

Comrade Cai Jintang, a member of the Communist Party and a heroic sailor, was the son of a poor peasant. Before his transfer, he was a soldier in a certain unit of the Navy. In this great revolutionary school of the People's Liberation Army, the thoughts of Mao Zedong nourished him, helping him grow rapidly.

In his diary, Cai Jintang wrote: "Those who protect their own selfish interests are the most despicable people. Those who have no selfishness are the most noble people." He regarded the "Three Articles" as the sharpest weapon for eliminating selfishness and often used them to combat selfish thoughts.

Once, when a maintenance job was almost finished, he suddenly heard an unusual sound from the class leader's machine gun. He wanted to go and check it, but then he thought, "He is the class leader, and I am a soldier. Why should I interfere?" and stopped in his tracks. During the noon break, he couldn't sleep, the sound of the gun's bolt kept ringing in his ears. Considering the division of labor and not taking responsibility for the work, how could this be considered "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people? He couldn't hold back any longer and immediately went to check. He found that a lock pin was loose and quickly took it apart to fix it. The class leader wanted to praise him for this, but Cai Jintang checked himself with the class leader: "Class leader, I should criticize myself. In the morning, I found the fault, but because of my selfish thoughts, I didn't dare to report it to you. Although the lock pin is fixed, I still need to eliminate this selfishness."

Cai Jintang took the thoughts of Mao Zedong as his guiding principle and always took Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Mountain as his examples. Once, during a small boat operation, his fingers were crushed, and a comrade accidentally fell between the warship and the small boat, risking being injured. At this moment, Cai Jintang immediately stretched out his arms and struggled to push the boat away. Although blood was dripping from his fingers, it was as painful as being pricked by needles, but he thought of the images of Zhang Zide and Norman Bethune and said to himself, "Even if the blood keeps flowing and the hand keeps hurting, I must rescue the comrade." He immediately summoned all his strength, and with the help of his comrades, rescued the comrade.

Once, the warship was docked at a certain port, and a level 7 storm blew in the middle of the night. Cai Jintang was awakened by the sound of the waves. He thought: "With such a big storm, can the fenders hold? Are the things on the deck secured?" With a strong sense of revolutionary responsibility, he immediately got up to inspect. As soon as he stepped out of the cabin, a big wave knocked him down on the deck. He listened to the sound and knew that the fenders had been crushed, and the protruding part of the ship was hitting the dock with a clanging sound. He quickly found a fender and went to the side of the ship, but as soon as he stood up, he was knocked down by the sea waves again. He immediately crawled step by step, placed the fender in the strained area, and ensured the safety of the warship.

Comrade Cai Jintang was like this, always putting Chairman Mao's teachings into action. On the eve of setting out to carry out the task of aiding Vietnam and resisting America, he once again studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and decided to be an internationalist like Norman Bethune. He wrote in his pledge:

"I will live to struggle to the end for the world revolution; I will die to shine for the liberation of all mankind!"

Our young hero fulfilled his vow, and the hero will forever live in the hearts of the people.

### 为世界革命奋斗到底——记“南海英雄船”英雄水手蔡锦堂烈士

    为世界革命奋斗到底
    ——记“南海英雄船”英雄水手蔡锦堂烈士
    去年八月二十九日凌晨，正当一○一八号货船在北部湾正常航线上航行时，美国空中强盗突然向我船只发动疯狂攻击。战斗警报一响，蔡锦堂飞快地跑上观察哨位，巍然挺立在战斗岗位上，严密地监视着敌机。
    美国飞贼俯冲盘旋了一阵，开始了野蛮的轰炸和扫射。蔡锦堂怀着满腔怒火，挥舞着双拳，和全船同志一道与敌机进行英勇的搏斗。他准确地报告着敌机的来踪去影，使货船几次避开了敌机的攻击。正当战斗最紧张的时刻，一块弹片突然窜进蔡锦堂的身躯。就在光荣牺牲的时候，他仍然双拳紧握，两眼怒视着美国飞贼。仿佛在喊：美帝国主义是全世界人民的死敌，打！打！打！
    共产党员、英雄水手蔡锦堂同志，是贫农的儿子，转业之前，是海军某部的战士。在解放军这个革命大学校里，毛泽东思想像雨露，滋润着他迅速成长。
    蔡锦堂在日记中写道：“替自己的私心护短的人，是最下贱的人，毫无自私自利之心的人，才是最高尚的人。”他把“老三篇”看作是挖掉私心的最锋利的武器，经常以“老三篇”来围歼思想上的私心杂念。
    一次检修工作快完的时候，突然听到班长的机枪拉栓声音有些异样。他想过去帮助检查，但转念一想：“他是班长，我是战士，何必管那么宽呢？”就煞住了脚步。中午休息时，他怎么也睡不着，枪栓的杂音总是在耳边响着。计较分工，对工作不负责任，这怎么能算“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务呢？他再也忍不住了，立即上去检查，发现有一个插锁松了，立刻拆下来修理好。班长知道这件事要表扬他，蔡锦堂却向班长检查自己：“班长，我应该向你检讨，早上我就发现了故障，因为有私心杂念，没敢向你提出来，插锁虽然修好了，但我还应该挖挖这块私心。”
    蔡锦堂把毛泽东思想作为自己行动的指针，处处以张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象作榜样。一次进行舢板作业，他的手指被压破，一位战友又不小心掉在军舰和舢板之间，有被挤伤的危险。这时，蔡锦堂立即伸开双臂拚命把船撑开。尽管鲜血不住从手指上一滴滴往下掉，像针扎一般疼痛，可是他一想起张思德、白求恩的形象，便对自己说：“就是鲜血再流，手再疼，我也要把战友抢救上来。”顿时鼓起全身力气，在同志们协助下把这位战友抢救上来了。
    一次，军舰停泊在某港，半夜刮起了七级大风，蔡锦堂被风浪声惊醒。他想：这么大的风浪，碰垫是否吃得住？舰面的东西是否固定好了？他怀着强烈的革命责任心，立即起来巡视。刚迈出舱口，一阵大浪就把他打倒在甲板上。他听了听声音，知道碰垫已被压碎，舰舷突出部分和码头碰得咣当直响。他立刻找了一个碰垫到舷边去，但是，一站起来就又被海浪打倒了。他马上一步一步地爬过去，把碰垫垫在吃力的地方，保证了军舰的安全。
    蔡锦堂同志就是这样，时时刻刻把毛主席的教导落实在行动上。在出发执行援越抗美任务的前夕，他再一次学习了《纪念白求恩》，决心要当白求恩式的国际主义战士。他在决心书上写道：
    “我活着，要为世界革命奋斗到底；我死了，要为全人类的解放闪光！”
    我们的青年英雄实践了自己的誓言，英雄永远活在人们的心中。
