Laotian patriotic military and civilians on the front lines of the anti-American struggle love Mao Zedong Thought, actively study Chairman Mao's works, and eagerly spread Mao Zedong Thought. They regard Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to defeat the enemy.

The Lao-Chinese Friendship School is an important bastion for spreading Mao Zedong Thought. At a recent school anniversary celebration, Nuan Pan, Director of the Education Bureau of Khammouane Province, said in his speech that spreading Mao Zedong Thought is the most important part of the entire revolutionary cause in Laos, because without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement. He hopes that the Lao people will better study and master Mao Zedong Thought.

The principal of the Lao-Chinese Friendship School, Mahakanda, also expressed at the celebration that Mao Zedong Thought should be used as a weapon, and that they should advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

The teachers' representative of the Lao-Chinese Friendship School presented a banner to the Chinese Red Guards and delivered a speech saying: "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of the world revolution in contemporary times, the red sun in the hearts of the proletariat of the whole world.

"The sharpest weapon in the world needs people to wield it, and the world revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought to guide it.

"The sun's rays can only illuminate the daytime of the world, but the rays of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate both the daytime and the nighttime of the whole world."

The speech said: "Chairman Mao is the most beloved leader of the oppressed people of the world. Your thought is an eternal truth that cannot be erased. Once the masses grasp your thought, the revolution will achieve victory. Your thought is the guide for proletarian revolutionaries to advance. We respect and love Chairman Mao the most. I sincerely shout: Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The broad masses of people and soldiers in the liberated areas of Laos are eagerly hoping to obtain Lao-language editions of Chairman Mao's works.

Some Lao friends, unable to find Lao-language editions of Chairman Mao's works for the time being, study the quotations from Chairman Mao printed in the news dispatches of the New China News Agency. They say, "Chairman Mao's quotations are too good."

Recently, the Lao-language edition of Chairman Mao's works published by the Lao-Chinese Friendship School was warmly welcomed and praised by local people from all walks of life as soon as it was published. A cadre from the command department of a certain unit of the Lao People's Liberation Army, after receiving the Mao Chairman's works sent by the Lao-Chinese Friendship School, praised it highly, saying: "The Lao-language edition of Chairman Mao's works is too good, and many people want it. This is a weapon!"

Many young soldiers of a certain unit of the Lao People's Liberation Army particularly like to read Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." One soldier said: "After studying 'Serve the People,' I understood that within our own ranks, no matter what we do, it is for the people. The purpose of our revolution is to liberate the people and make the suffering people the masters of their own country." Another soldier said: "If one wants to be a true revolutionary, one must wholeheartedly serve the people and must not be afraid of criticism."

The people in the liberated areas of Laos are studying Chairman Mao's works with great enthusiasm because they deeply understand: "Whoever masters Mao Zedong Thought, whoever masters the truth; and mastering the truth, the revolution will definitely succeed."

    老挝爱国军民积极学习毛主席著作
    掌握了毛泽东思想，革命就一定胜利
    据新华社讯　在反美斗争前线的老挝爱国军民热爱毛泽东思想，积极学习毛主席著作，热心传播毛泽东思想。他们把毛泽东思想看成是战胜敌人的最锐利武器。
    老挝老中友谊学校是传播毛泽东思想的一个重要阵地。在该校不久以前的校庆纪念会上，老挝川圹省教育局长努潘发表讲话说，传播毛泽东思想是老挝整个革命事业中最重要的一部分，因为没有革命的理论就没有革命的运动。他希望老挝人民更好地学习和掌握毛泽东思想。
    老中友谊学校校长马哈·坎丹也在庆祝会上表示，要以毛泽东思想作为武器，按照毛主席指出的方向前进。
    老中友谊学校的教师代表向中国红卫兵赠送锦旗，并致颂词说：“毛主席是当代世界革命最伟大的领袖，是全世界无产阶级心中的红太阳。
    “世界上最锐利的武器需要人去掌握，世界革命需要毛泽东思想去指导。
    “太阳的光辉只能照耀世界的白天，毛泽东思想的光辉却照亮了整个世界的白天和黑夜。”
    颂词说：“毛主席是全世界被压迫人民最最爱戴的领袖，您的思想是永远不可磨灭的真理。群众一旦掌握了您的思想，革命就取得胜利。您的思想是无产阶级革命者向前迈进的指南。我们最尊敬、最爱戴的是毛主席。我衷心高呼：毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”
    老挝解放区广大人民和战士如饥似渴地希望得到老文版的毛主席著作。
    有些老挝朋友由于一时找不到老文的毛主席著作，他们就学习新华社新闻稿上刊印的毛主席语录。他们说，毛主席语录太好了。
    最近老挝老中友谊学校出版的老文的毛主席著作刚一出版，就受到当地各界人士的热烈欢迎和赞扬。老挝人民解放军某部指挥部一位干部在得到老中友谊学校送给他的毛主席著作后赞不绝口地说：“老文的毛主席著作，太好了，还有许多人要，这是武器啊！”
    老挝人民解放军某部的许多青年战士特别喜欢读毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》这三篇著作。一位战士说：“学了《为人民服务》以后，我明白了在自己的队伍内，不论干什么，都是为人民服务。我们革命的目的就是为了解放人民，使受苦的人民成为自己国家的主人。”另一位战士说：“如果要作一个真正的革命者，就要全心全意为人民服务，就要不怕批评。”
    老挝解放区人民对于学习毛主席著作怀着极大的热情，因为他们深深懂得：“谁掌握了毛泽东思想，谁就掌握了真理；而掌握了真理，革命一定就能成功。”
