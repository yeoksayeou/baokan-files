Victory songs resound, and good news comes frequently. Twenty-three revolutionary rebel organizations in Qingdao have united! They have seized the power over party, government, finance, and culture from those within the party who are taking the capitalist road and from the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line! This is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought following the successful seizure of power by the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and Shanxi.

The Qingdao proletarian revolutionary rebels have gained this significant victory through multifaceted experiences, the most important of which is: achieving the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

Only by truly achieving the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels can we successfully launch the struggle for power. Without this great unity, rushing to seize power would either be empty talk or reckless action. It would definitely not work out. Therefore, the key lies in great unity. The revolutionary practice of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels has proven this, the revolutionary practice of the Shanxi provincial revolutionary rebels has proven this, and now the successful experience of the Qingdao revolutionary rebels in seizing power has once again proven this.

Currently, in some regions and units, various issues and obstacles have arisen regarding the seizure of power. These obstacles mainly come from the handful of those within the party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as from the old social forces. The current manifestation of these obstacles is the hindrance to achieving the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels.

Within our revolutionary rebel ranks, due to the influence of some bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, in some places, units, and organizations, there exist varying degrees of individualism, factionalism, and cliquism; in some revolutionary rebels, there still exist serious personalism, ultra-democratic views, and anti-organizational sentiments. These all hinder and affect the great unity of the revolutionary rebels, hindering and affecting our struggle to seize power victoriously.

Efforts to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and to link them with actual struggles, correct erroneous tendencies, and strengthen organizational discipline are of great significance for achieving the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

The class enemy is terrified of our great unity and hates it to the core. They use every means to sabotage this unity. Those within the party who are taking the capitalist road, using their temporarily usurped various powers, and using the shortcomings within the revolutionary rebels and the non-proletarian ideas of some individuals, attempt to split and disintegrate, aiming to create opposition within the revolutionary rebels, sabotage the great unity and great alliance of the revolutionary rebels, and thus maintain their own power and position. Comrades of the revolutionary rebels, this is something we must be highly vigilant about!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The enemy fears our unity and sabotages our unity, so we must definitely unite. The proletarian revolutionary rebels of Qingdao, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have exposed and firmly struck down the various tricks and evil activities of the class enemy that sabotage unity. Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and on the common principle of the proletarian revolutionary line, they have united to establish a revolutionary rebel committee with the working class as the leader and based on the great unity of workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres. This organizational form has become the power organ to unify the leadership of the struggle for power. In achieving the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces, the leading comrades who insist on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao play an important role. Under the unified leadership of the revolutionary rebel committee, the struggle for power in Qingdao has achieved decisive victory. They have provided valuable experience for revolutionary rebels across the country.

All genuine proletarian revolutionary rebels, unite under the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, achieve the broadest and closest great unity, and seize new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 关键在于大联合

　　关键在于大联合
　　凯歌阵阵，喜讯频传。青岛市二十三个革命造反团体联合起来了，他们把青岛市的党、政、财、文大权，从党内走资本主义道路的当权派手中，从坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子手里夺过来了！这是继上海、山西无产阶级革命造反派成功地夺权之后，毛泽东思想的又一次伟大胜利。
    青岛市无产阶级革命造反派，取得这次重大胜利的经验是多方面的，其中最最重要的一条就是：实现了无产阶级革命造反派在毛泽东思想基础上的大联合。
    只有真正实现了无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，才能胜利地展开夺权斗争。没有这种大联合，匆匆忙忙地跑去夺权，那不是空话，便是妄动。那一定是搞不好的。所以，关键在于大联合。上海革命造反派的革命实践证实了这一点，山西省革命造反派的革命实践证实了这一点，现在青岛市革命造反派夺权的成功经验再一次证实了这一点。
    目前，有些地区，有些单位，在夺权问题上产生了这样或那样的问题，出现了这样或那样的阻力。这种阻力，主要来自那些混进党内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，同时也来自旧的社会习惯势力。这种阻力，在当前的表现形式，就是妨碍实现无产阶级革命造反派大联合。
    在我们革命造反派内部，由于受到一些资产阶级、小资产阶级思想影响，在有些地方，有些单位，有些组织当中，存在着不同程度的风头主义，山头主义，小团体主义；在有些革命造反者身上还存在着相当严重的个人主义，极端民主化和非组织观点。这些都妨碍和影响了革命造反派的大联合，妨碍和影响了我们去进行胜利的夺权斗争。
    努力学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，联系实际斗争，纠正错误倾向，加强组织纪律性，对于实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，具有重大的意义。
    阶级敌人对我们的大联合怕得要死，恨之入骨。他们千方百计地破坏这种大联合。那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，利用他们暂时还窃踞的各种职权，利用革命造反派内部的缺点和部分人的一些非无产阶级思想，进行分化瓦解，妄图在革命造反派内部制造反对派，破坏革命造反派的大团结、大联合，从而达到保他们自己权力地位的目的。革命造反派的同志们，这是多么值得我们警惕的啊！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”敌人害怕我们联合，破坏我们联合，我们就一定要联合。青岛市的无产阶级革命造反派，遵循了毛主席的教导，对于阶级敌人破坏联合的种种阴谋诡计和罪恶活动，进行了无情的揭露和坚决的打击。在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，在无产阶级革命路线的共同原则的基础上联合起来，建立以工人阶级为领导，以工人、农民、革命学生、革命知识分子和革命干部大联合为基础的革命造反委员会。这种组织形式，成为统一领导夺权斗争的权力机构。在实现无产阶级革命派大联合中，坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的领导同志，起着重要的作用。青岛市的夺权斗争，在革命造反委员会的统一领导下，取得了决定性胜利。他们为全国革命造反派提供了宝贵的经验。
    一切真正的无产阶级革命造反派，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下团结起来，实现最广泛最紧密的大联合，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利！
