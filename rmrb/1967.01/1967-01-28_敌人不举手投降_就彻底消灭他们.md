The People's Liberation Army must resolutely support the revolutionary leftists. This is a great new task that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have given us in the new situation and new stage of the Cultural Revolution. We enthusiastically and resolutely support the editorial "The People's Liberation Army Resolutely Supports the Revolutionary Leftists" published in the *Liberation Army News*.

The struggle to seize power from those in authority who are taking the capitalist road is completely reasonable and just. Reason is the truth of Mao Zedong Thought; justice is the sentiment of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Chairman Mao teaches us: the fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. With the proletariat's seal of approval, there will be the proletariat's hammer, sickle, and pen. Without the proletariat's seal of approval, everything will be lost. The proletariat's seal of approval is won with the gun, and defending the proletariat's seal of approval also relies on the gun. We must firmly grasp the gun, based on the demands of the broad revolutionary leftists, and most resolutely support their struggle to seize power, so that the power of the proletariat is forever in our own hands, and so that our country forever maintains its red color. Chairman Mao says: "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." Supporting the revolutionary leftists in seizing power from those in authority who are taking the capitalist road is our current greatest political task. We must resolutely support and assist the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, and seize back all the political, economic, financial, and other powers usurped by those in authority who are taking the capitalist road.

All revolutionary leftists, regardless of whether their strength is great or small, we must resolutely support; all counter-revolutionary elements who oppose the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat, regardless of whether they are many or few, we must suppress. Our eyes are clear. We and the broad revolutionary leftists have stood together in the past, stand together now, and will stand together in the future. All rightists, if they do not surrender with their hands raised, we will completely annihilate them. We are forever loyal to Chairman Mao. In the past, we followed Chairman Mao to fight for New China; now, we still follow Chairman Mao to defend the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, to defend the revolutionary power of the proletariat; in the future, we will forever follow Chairman Mao to fight for a new world where the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought flies high!

　　敌人不举手投降　就彻底消灭他们
　　解放军沈阳部队某部副指导员　王道明
    人民解放军要坚决支持无产阶级革命左派。这是毛主席、党中央在文化大革命的新形势下、新阶段中对我们部队提出的一项伟大的新任务。我们最热烈、最坚决地拥护《解放军报》发表的《人民解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命派》的社论。
    向走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的斗争，是完全合理合情的。理，就是毛泽东思想的真理；情，就是无产阶级革命群众的感情。毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了无产阶级的印把子，才会有无产阶级的锤把子、锄把子、笔杆子。失掉了无产阶级的印把子，就失掉了无产阶级的一切。无产阶级的印把子是用枪杆子打出来的，保卫无产阶级的印把子，也要靠枪杆子。我们一定要握紧枪杆子，根据广大革命左派的要求，最坚决地支持他们的夺权斗争，让无产阶级的权永远掌握在自己的手里，让我们国家永远保持鲜红的颜色。毛主席说：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”支持革命左派向走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，是我们当前最大的政治任务。我们要坚决支持和援助无产阶级革命左派，把走资本主义道路当权派篡夺的政治、经济、财政等一切权力统统夺回来。
    凡是革命的左派，无论他们的力量是大是小，我们都必须坚决支持；凡是反对无产阶级革命左派的反革命分子，不管他们是多是少，我们都要镇压。我们的眼睛是雪亮的，我们和广大革命左派过去、现在、将来都坚定地站在一起。一切右派分子如果不举手投降，我们就彻底地消灭他们。我们是永远忠于毛主席的。过去，我们紧跟毛主席打出了新中国；现在，我们还是紧跟毛主席捍卫无产阶级文化大革命，捍卫无产阶级革命政权；将来，我们还要永远跟着毛主席，打出一个毛泽东思想红旗高高飘扬的红彤彤的新世界！
