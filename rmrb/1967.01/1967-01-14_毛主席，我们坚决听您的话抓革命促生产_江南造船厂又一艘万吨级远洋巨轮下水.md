Seize the revolution, promote production, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line

Chairman Mao, we resolutely follow your words to seize the revolution and promote production

Jiangnan Shipyard launches another 10,000-ton ocean-going giant vessel

All revolutionary workers of the factory unanimously declared at a rally: We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, smash the new schemes and counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, repel the attacks of sugar-coated bullets, firmly guard our production posts, and achieve greater victories in the revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 12th: On January 10th, the eleventh anniversary of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard, the revolutionary workers of Jiangnan Shipyard, with an unyielding spirit and a determination to strive for progress, together with comrades from the scientific research and design departments, designed and manufactured another 10,000-ton ocean-going giant vessel, the "Chao Yang," which was solemnly launched on this day. This is a new victory for the revolutionary workers in resolutely responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," and a powerful counterattack against the attempt by a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party and those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line to sabotage production.

In the afternoon of the 10th, the shipyard's riverside platform was adorned with a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, with red flags waving and drums beating. On both sides of the new giant vessel "Chao Yang," more than ten thousand revolutionary workers and Red Guards and revolutionary students from various places who came to link up participated in the launching ceremony. Amid the solemn music of "The East Is Red," this giant vessel, as high as a five-story building, slid smoothly into the Huangpu River, stirring up waves of joy. At this moment, the shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao" echoed through the sky.

After the giant vessel was launched, all the revolutionary workers of the factory held a "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production" rally. The revolutionary workers expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," and, according to Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, ensure that everyone reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good workers of Chairman Mao, and raising the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

The meeting passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao. The telegram said: Eleven years ago today, the hearts of millions of workers at Jiangnan Shipyard surged like the rushing waters of the river, and the cheers of millions of people thundered like spring thunder. Our great leader Chairman Mao came to Jiangnan Shipyard. Chairman Mao, it is you who have led us to navigate past all reefs and surmount all stormy waves, from one victory to another! It is you who believe in the people the most, care for the people the most, and respect the people's revolutionary initiative the most, pushing the surging tide of the Cultural Revolution from one high tide to another. The telegram said: Seizing the revolution and promoting production is a major policy you have put forward. We pledge to you that we will resolutely respond to your great call. Even if it means climbing the knife mountain or entering the fire sea, we will never let the schemes of that handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party and the stubborn adherents of the bourgeois reactionary line succeed. Whoever dares to oppose you, whoever dares to oppose your revolutionary line, we revolutionary rebels will resolutely overthrow them and make them never stand up again.

At the rally, the revolutionary workers of Jiangnan Shipyard unanimously declared: We revolutionary rebels listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, smash the new schemes, counterattacks, and challenges of the bourgeois reactionary line in the current stage, and repel the attacks of sugar-coated bullets. We revolutionary rebels will resolutely seize the revolution and promote production, firmly guard our production posts, and celebrate with actual actions the eleventh anniversary of our great leader Chairman Mao's inspection of the factory. The revolutionary workers of the outfitting workshop have established a revolutionary production committee to better complete this year's national production tasks. An old worker said: We are both a revolutionary rebel team and a production combat team. We guarantee to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end and achieve greater victories on the production front, seizing a double harvest of revolution and production.

Representatives from the Third Headquarters of the Capital, the Jinggangshan Corps of Tsinghua University, and the Red Rebel Corps of the Harbin Military Engineering Institute, who are participating in labor at Jiangnan Shipyard, made a joint speech at the rally. Their speech said: The revolutionary forces in the Shanghai area are achieving great unity and great solidarity, launching a general offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line, and have dealt a powerful blow to the great scheme of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party and those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line to sabotage the revolution and production. Under this great situation, we pledge to our most beloved Chairman Mao that we will definitely fight together with the worker comrades and rebel comrades to seize new victories.

The "Chao Yang" 10,000-ton ocean-going cargo ship is a domestically designed and manufactured ship with advanced technology. The successful design and manufacture of this giant vessel fully demonstrate the tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought.

    十日下午，江南造船厂的江边船台上，悬挂着巨幅毛主席的画像，红旗招展，锣鼓喧天。在“朝阳号”新巨轮两侧，一万多革命工人和各地前来串连的红卫兵、革命师生，参加了下水典礼。在庄严的《东方红》音乐声中，这艘有五层楼高的巨轮，轻快地滑进黄浦江，激起了欢乐的浪花。这时，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声响彻云霄。
    巨轮下水后，全厂革命造反派的工人举行了“抓革命，促生产誓师大会”。革命工人们表示坚决听毛主席的话，坚决执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，并按照林彪同志的指示，做到人人读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好工人，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段。

    在江南造船厂参加劳动的首都第三司令部、清华大学井冈山兵团和哈尔滨军事工程学院红色造反团的驻沪联络站代表在誓师大会上联合发言。他们的发言说：上海地区的革命力量正在实现大联合、大团结，向资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击，对一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人破坏革命、破坏生产的大阴谋进行了有力的回击。在这一大好形势下，我们向最最敬爱的毛主席保证，一定和工人师傅、造反队战友们一起战斗，夺取新的胜利。
