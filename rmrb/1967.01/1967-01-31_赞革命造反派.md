Author: Huang Wuli
Date: 1967-01-31
Edition: 6

	The bugle calls resound, the war drums beat loudly; we cheer and leap:
	“Revolutionary rebels, you have seized power well!”
	Revolutionary rebels, you are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, with iron bones and hearts aflame!
	For the revolution, “you dare to be skinned alive and pull the emperor from his throne”!
	For the revolution, you climb the knife mountain, brave the sea of fire, unflinching and fearless!
	Revolutionary rebels, you are the shock troops, the demolition experts!
	You take up the revolutionary explosive packs, pierce through the fog and brave the wind, blowing up,
	one by one, the strongholds of the bourgeoisie!
	Revolutionary rebels, your hearts are red, your wills are firm, your courage is great, your skills are high!
	You carry the double burden of revolution and production; the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought,
	you hold it highest!
	We, Chairman Mao's revolutionary soldiers, firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call:
	With all our hearts, we support you, fight alongside you!
	Defending the revolution is our sacred duty, communism is our common revolutionary goal.
	Let us unite closely, open fire fiercely on the reactionary bourgeois line, open fire!

　　赞革命造反派
　　解放军某部战士　黄武力号角声声长鸣，战鼓咚咚紧敲；我们欢呼跳跃：
  “革命造反派啊，你们夺权夺得好！”革命造反派啊，你们是毛主席的红小兵，钢筋铁骨红心跃！为革命，
  “舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”！为革命，上刀山，闯火海，脸不变色心不跳！革命造反派啊，你们是冲锋陷阵的爆破手！接过革命的炸药包，拨开迷雾顶风上，把资产阶级顽固碉堡，
  一个一个炸掉炸掉！革命造反派啊，你们心红志坚，胆大艺高！抓革命，促生产，两副重担肩上挑；毛泽东思想伟大红旗，你们举得最高！我们，毛主席的革命战士，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召：满腔热情地支持你们，紧紧地和你们战斗在一道！保卫革命是我们的神圣职责，共产主义理想是我们共同的革命目标，让我们紧紧联合起来，向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开炮，开炮！
