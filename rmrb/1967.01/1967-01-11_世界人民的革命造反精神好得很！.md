The revolutionary spirit of rebellion among the world's people is excellent!

Rebel! Rebel! The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are all rising up in rebellion!

The world today is a world of revolutionary rebellion!

The present era is an era of revolutionary rebellion!

Chairman Mao says: "The thousands of truths of Marxism boil down to one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' ... Based on this truth, people resist, struggle, and build socialism."

Based on this truth, the people of various countries are rebelling against imperialism, rebelling against modern revisionism, and rebelling against the reactionaries of their own countries.

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries will not voluntarily leave the stage of history. If you do not strike, they will not fall. Only by thoroughly smashing the old world can a new world be created. Chairman Mao says: "The people of the whole world must have the courage to fight, dare to struggle, and be unafraid of difficulties, advancing wave upon wave. In that case, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All devils will be thoroughly annihilated." This is the common belief of the people of the world.

The revolutionary spirit of rebellion among the world's people is excellent!

    世界人民的革命造反精神好得很！
    造反！造反！亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的人民，到处都在起来造反！
    现在的世界，是一个革命造反的世界！
    当今的时代，是一个革命造反的时代！
    毛主席说：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”
    根据这个道理，各国人民正在大造帝国主义的反，大造现代修正主义的反，大造各国反动派的反。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，是不会自行退出历史舞台的。你不打，它就不倒。只有彻底砸烂旧世界，才能创造新世界。毛主席说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”这是世界人民的共同信念。
    全世界人民的革命造反精神好得很！
