World Revolutionary People Warmly Hail
The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought in the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution

Many Asian and African friends warmly hail the one victory after another achieved in the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. They say that this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, a great victory of world significance.

The Chief Representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Dar es Salaam, David Sibeko, said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the 14th: Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will certainly defeat the bourgeois reactionary line. This is because the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is in the interests of the people, while the bourgeois reactionary line is only in the interests of a handful of bourgeois elements.

He said that the people of Azania firmly believe that the victories won by the Chinese people in this class struggle are of great significance not only to the struggle of the Chinese people but also have a far-reaching influence on the just struggle of the world's people for freedom.

Sibeko said that imperialists and their lackeys fantasize that the younger generation in China will deviate from Mao Zedong Thought and the correct line formulated by Chairman Mao; however, through the cultural revolution, Chinese youth have become even more revolutionary. This guarantees the victorious advance of the Chinese socialist revolution.

He quoted a quotation from Chairman Mao to refute the slanders of imperialists and their lackeys against the Chinese cultural revolution. He said: "Chairman Mao pointed out: 'If the enemy vigorously opposes us, and says that we are utterly worthless, then that is even better. It proves not only that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation with the enemy, but also that our work has achieved great success.'"

The spokesman for the Zimbabwe African National Union office in Dar es Salaam said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the 14th: The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is an extremely significant event for China and the world. The success of the cultural revolution is a guarantee of the victory of socialism.

He emphasized: "Mao Zedong Thought is leading the socialist cause into a new era."

The international representative of the Basutoland Congress Party in Dar es Salaam, Ramagela Chinyane, said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the 14th: The victory of the Chinese cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, "is a great blow to imperialism and its lackeys." The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution guarantees the socialist revolution and socialist construction in China and ensures that China will definitely advance along the socialist road.

He said that the cultural revolution has proven that "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

Somali friend Abdulwahab Haji Hussein recently published an article praising the Chinese cultural revolution as "a massive revolutionary action participated in by hundreds of millions of Chinese people." The article, in refuting the slanders of American imperialism and modern revisionism against the Chinese cultural revolution, said: "American imperialism and modern revisionism and their running dogs distort the cultural revolution and spread rumors against the cultural revolution, but all of this is groundless."

A Senegalese worker recently wrote to Xinhua News Agency, warmly praising the great proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao, which creatively developed Marxism-Leninism.

Yemeni poet Abdulla Baraduni said to a Xinhua News Agency reporter: The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is a guarantee for the continued and thorough advancement of the Chinese socialist revolution.

    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻达累斯萨拉姆的首席代表戴维·西贝科十四日对新华社记者说：毛主席的无产阶级革命路线肯定要战胜资产阶级反动路线。这是因为，以毛主席为代表的革命路线符合于人民利益，而资产阶级反动路线只是为了维护一小撮资产阶级分子的利益的。
    他说，阿扎尼亚人民深信，中国人民在这场阶级斗争中所赢得的胜利，不仅对中国人民的斗争有重大意义，而且对世界人民争取自由的正义斗争也有深远影响。
    西贝科说，帝国主义者及其帮凶幻想中国的年轻一代会脱离毛泽东思想和毛主席所制定的正确路线；但是，通过文化大革命，中国青年更加革命化了。这保证了中国社会主义革命的胜利前进。
    他引用毛主席的一条语录来驳斥帝国主义及其帮凶对中国文化大革命的诬蔑。他说：“毛主席指出：‘如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。’”
    津巴布韦非洲民族联盟驻达累斯萨拉姆办事处发言人十四日对新华社记者说：中国的无产阶级文化大革命，对于中国和全世界来说，都是极其重大的事件。文化大革命的成功是社会主义胜利的保证。
    他强调指出：“毛泽东思想正在把社会主义事业引到新的时代。”
    巴苏陀兰大会党驻达累斯萨拉姆国际代表拉马格勒·钦亚恩十四日对新华社记者说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国文化大革命的胜利，“是对帝国主义及其帮凶的巨大打击”。中国的无产阶级文化大革命，保证了中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，并且使中国一定会沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    他说，文化大革命证明了，“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。”
    索马里朋友阿卜杜勒瓦哈布·哈吉·侯赛因最近发表文章赞扬中国文化大革命是“由亿万中国人民参加的规模巨大的革命行动”。文章在驳斥美帝国主义和现代修正主义对中国文化大革命的诬蔑时说：“美帝国主义和现代修正主义及其走狗歪曲文化大革命，散布反对文化大革命的流言蜚语，但是所有这一切都是毫无根据的。”
    一位塞内加尔工人最近在写给新华社的一封信中，热烈赞扬伟大的毛主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。
    也门诗人阿卜杜拉·巴拉杜尼对新华社记者说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是使中国社会主义革命继续前进并进行到底的保证。
