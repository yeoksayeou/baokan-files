Only the Obligation to Voluntarily Execute, No Right to Add Impurities

	Assistant Squad Leader Cai Jusheng

In every march and camp setup, our platoon ensures that everyone takes the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" as a mirror, checking themselves daily and in all matters. Everyone regards strictly adhering to discipline as an obligation to carry out the highest directives and to uphold the honor of our army. No one has the slightest right to add impurities. In this way, we can achieve: marching in the forefront and camping in a red zone.

One evening, after the troops had marched to a mountain village, a sudden downpour began. Soon, the mountain road was washed out by the heavy rain, and the supply team's cart carrying firewood, rice, oil, and salt could not enter the village. The company decided that each squad would cook for themselves. Everyone busied themselves in the villagers' homes, boiling water, and cooking a pot of noodles. The noodles were cooked, but I found there was no salt to add. After searching, I finally saw a jar of salt on the villagers' stove. I borrowed a bit of salt from the villagers.

The next day, the troops assembled to depart. The platoon leader, standing at the front, said, "Comrades, please carefully check if you have returned all borrowed items from the villagers." Following this, everyone sang the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" song. The platoon leader's reminder and the song made me recall borrowing a bit of salt from the villagers. I thought, although a bit of salt is not worth much, the villagers would definitely not mind, but upholding our army's honorable tradition of returning borrowed items is of utmost importance. If I were to overlook this bit of salt, it would be adding impurities in the execution, violating our army's honorable tradition. This is absolutely not allowed. Thinking of this, I quickly ran to the supply team, grabbed a bit of salt, and returned it to the villagers. The villager, receiving the salt with both hands, was very moved and praised our army's good tradition. From this, I further understood that such a specific matter in daily life also continuously enhances the people's understanding of the essence of our people's army. Therefore, every comrade in our revolutionary ranks should meticulously execute the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and set a shining example to uphold the honor of our revolutionary collective. Only in this way can we everywhere reflect the revolutionary spirit of the people's soldiers who love the great leader infinitely and faithfully execute the great leader's directives.

    只有自觉执行的义务，没有掺假的权利
    副班长　蔡菊生
    我们连在每次行军宿营中，人人都能自觉地把“三大纪律八项注意”当作一面镜子，天天照，事事照。大家把严守纪律看成是执行最高指示、维护我军荣誉的义务，谁也没有丝毫掺假的权利。这样，我们就能够做到：行军红一线，住下红一片。
    有一天傍晚，部队行军刚刚到达一个山村，突然下起瓢泼大雨。不一会，山路被暴雨冲坏了，炊事班运载柴、米、油、盐的马车一时无法进村。连里决定由各班自己做饭。大家就在老乡家里忙了起来，烧开了水，煮了一锅面条。面条煮好了，我发现没有盐下锅。找了一下，最后看见社员家的锅台上放着一罐盐，我就借用了社员一把盐。
    第二天部队集合要出发，排长在队前说：“同志们，请大家认真检查一下，借用社员的东西是否全部归还了？”接着，大家唱起《三大纪律八项注意》歌。排长一提醒，歌儿一唱，我就想起借用社员一把盐的事来了。我想，一把盐虽然不值几分钱，社员也决不会去计较，但是，维护我军“借东西要还”的光荣传统是头等大事；这一把盐马虎了事，就是在执行中掺了假，违背了我军的光荣传统。这是万万不行的。想到这里，我连忙跑到炊事班，抓来一把盐，送还了社员。那位社员双手捧过盐，十分激动地赞扬我军的好传统。我从这里进一步体会到，这样一件生活的具体事情，也在不断地提高人民群众对我们人民军队本质的认识。所以，我们革命队伍里的每一个同志，都应该一丝不苟地执行“三大纪律八项注意”，为维护我们革命集体的荣誉树立光辉的榜样。只有这样，才能处处体现人民战士无限热爱伟大领袖、忠实执行伟大领袖指示的革命本色。
