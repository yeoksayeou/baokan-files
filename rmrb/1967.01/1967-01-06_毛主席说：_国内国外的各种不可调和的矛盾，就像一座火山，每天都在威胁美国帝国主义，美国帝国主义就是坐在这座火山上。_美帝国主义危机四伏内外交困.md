As the people of the world raise the red flag of revolution and sing songs of victory to bid farewell to 1966, and stride forward into 1967, the imperialist camp led by the United States is in a state of decline and despair.

In the past year, the revolutionary storm of the people of the world has surged forward, and the people of various countries have achieved one great victory after another in their struggles against U.S.-led imperialism and its running dogs. They have dealt heavy blows to the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, causing the imperialist camp led by the United States to accelerate its disintegration. Their days of being buried will not be long.

Chairman Mao said: "Domestic and international contradictions that cannot be reconciled are like a volcano, threatening U.S. imperialism every day. U.S. imperialism is sitting on this volcano."

U.S. imperialism is in crisis, beset with problems both internally and externally.

Chairman Mao said: "U.S. imperialism is rampant everywhere, putting itself in a position of enmity with the people of the world, making itself more and more isolated." Currently, U.S. imperialism is in deep crisis, with no way out, which is evidence of this situation.

The true colors of U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger have been particularly exposed in the war of aggression against Vietnam. In the past year, in its desperate struggle, it has escalated the war, only to be defeated by the heroic Vietnamese people, suffering a great failure. The number of U.S. troops invading Vietnam was less than twenty thousand at the beginning of 1966, but by the end of the year, it had increased to nearly forty thousand. This war not only consumes a large number of "elite" troops from various branches of the U.S. military, exposing the fatal strategic weaknesses of U.S. imperialism such as a long front line, insufficient troops, a distant rear, and supply difficulties, but also disrupts the U.S. global strategic deployment, making the U.S. unable to cope with both ends, always passive and on the defensive. The war of aggression against Vietnam has become the biggest noose, tightly around the neck of U.S. imperialism.

To get out of the Vietnam quagmire, U.S. imperialism has both madly escalated the war and used every means to play the "peace talks" trick. Recently, while bombing Hanoi, it has also colluded with the Soviet revisionist leadership and other reactionaries to push forward the conspiracies of "bombing to force peace" and "stopping the war to deceive peace."

However, in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people who are resolutely fighting against U.S. aggression and saving the country, both of U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary strategies have suffered disgraceful failures. The crimes of U.S. aggression have also aroused the indignation and condemnation of the people of the world, and many of the U.S.'s allies are afraid of getting burned and do not dare to pick chestnuts out of the fire for the U.S., making the U.S. more isolated than ever in the international arena, in a very embarrassing situation.

The U.S. imperialism, which has been badly beaten in Vietnam, has become even more frantic in its policy of opposing China in the past year. With the help of the Soviet revisionist leadership, it has shifted the global counter-revolutionary strategy from Europe to Asia, and with the active participation of these traitors of the world revolutionary people, it has colluded with the reactionaries of India, Japan, and other countries to intensify the organization of the anti-China encirclement, forming a new "holy alliance" against China. However, their frantic anti-China actions have been strongly opposed and condemned by China and the revolutionary people of the world. U.S. imperialism and its few accomplices are becoming more and more isolated, and many of the U.S.'s allies are afraid of being destroyed along with the U.S. and hesitate to move forward, making the anti-China "holy alliance" disintegrate.

The failures on the battlefield and the setbacks in diplomacy have exacerbated the difficulties and crises within U.S. imperialism. The continuous increase in military spending and the blind expansion of productive forces stimulated by the war of aggression against Vietnam and the expansion of military preparations have become the heaviest burden on the U.S. economy. The U.S. has a huge budget deficit, the position of the dollar is shaky, inflation is becoming more serious, and prices are rising rapidly. The three pillars of the U.S. economy, steel, automobiles, and construction, all show ominous signs of economic prospects. Various situations indicate that the increasingly worsening inflation and the increasingly obvious signs of economic crisis are putting the U.S. economy in a pincer movement. U.S. monopolists are all pessimistic when looking to the future.

Domestic and international contradictions that cannot be reconciled are exacerbating class contradictions within the U.S. and causing fierce arguments within the ruling class. Many politicians and journalists in the U.S. are talking about the unprecedented serious "trust gap" between the Johnson administration and the American people, accusing Johnson of deceiving the people in matters of Vietnam, budget, taxation, and other major domestic and international issues, and being untrustworthy. Johnson's days will be even harder in the next two years of his term.

### 毛主席说：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就像一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”  美帝国主义危机四伏内外交困

    当世界人民高举革命红旗，高唱凯歌送别一九六六年，昂首阔步跨进一九六七年的时候，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营却是日暮途穷，一片凄凉景象。
    过去一年，全世界人民的革命风暴波澜壮阔地向纵深发展，各国人民在同以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的搏斗中，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利，沉重地打击了全世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义，使得以美国为首的帝国主义阵营加速分崩离析。他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。
    毛主席说：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就像一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”
    美帝国主义危机四伏内外交困
    毛主席说：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。”目前美帝国主义危机重重，走投无路，就是这种状况的铁证。
    美帝国主义纸老虎的原形，在侵略越南的战争中特别明显地暴露出来。过去一年，它为了进行垂死的挣扎，实行了战争大升级，结果被英雄的越南人民打得落花流水，遭到了大失败。侵越美军在一九六六年初不到二十万人，到年底已经增加到近四十万人。这场战争不仅越来越大量地消耗着美国各军种的“精锐部队”，使美帝国主义战线太长、兵力不足、后方太远、供应困难等致命性战略弱点暴露无遗，而且打乱了美国的全球战略部署，使美国首尾难顾，处处被动挨打。侵越战争已经成了一条最大的绞索，紧紧地套在美帝国主义的脖子上。
    为摆脱侵越困境，美帝国主义既疯狂地进行战争升级，又千方百计地玩弄“和平谈判”的骗局。最近，它在对河内进行狂轰滥炸的同时，又勾结苏联修正主义领导集团和其他反动派，加紧推行“以炸迫和”和“停战诱和”的阴谋。
    但是，在坚决抗美救国的英雄的越南人民面前，美帝国主义的反革命两手策略，都遭到了可耻的破产。美国的侵略罪行也激起了全世界人民愤怒的声讨，而美国的许多盟国都害怕惹火烧身，不肯为美国火中取栗，使美国在国际上空前孤立，十分狼狈。
    在越南碰得焦头烂额的美帝国主义，过去一年更加疯狂地推行反对中国的政策。它在苏联修正主义领导集团的帮忙下，把全球反革命战略重点从欧洲移到亚洲，并且在世界革命人民的这批叛徒的积极参与下，勾结印度、日本等国的反动派，加紧组织反华包围圈，拼凑反华新“神圣同盟”。但是，它们的这种疯狂反华的行径，遭到中国和全世界革命人民强烈的反对和谴责。美帝国主义和它的一小撮帮凶越来越孤立了，美国的许多盟国也害怕同美国一起遭到毁灭性的惩罚而踟蹰不前了，反华“神圣同盟”正陷于分崩离析。
    战场上的失败和外交上的挫折，促进和加剧了美帝国主义国内的困难和危机。军费的不断增加以及在侵越战争和扩军备战刺激下盲目扩充的生产力，已成为美国经济最沉重负担。财政出现巨额赤字，美元地位风雨飘摇，通货膨胀日益严重，物价迅速上涨。美国经济的三大支柱钢铁、汽车和建筑工业，都出现预示经济前景不妙的凶兆。种种情况表明，越来越恶化的通货膨胀和越来越明显的经济危机征象，对美国经济形成了两面夹击之势。美国的垄断资本家在瞻望前景时，都发出一片悲观论调。
    国内外各种不可调和的矛盾，在加剧着美国国内的阶级矛盾，并在统治集团内部引起激烈争吵。美国许多政界和报界人士都在谈论约翰逊政府和美国人民之间存在着空前未有的严重的“信任差距”，指责约翰逊无论是在越南问题还是在预算问题、税收问题以及国内外其他重大问题上都在欺骗人民，不可信任。约翰逊在今后两年任期内的日子，将更加不好过。
