The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union held a meeting to denounce the fascist atrocities of the Soviet revisionists. Mao Zedong Thought must spread throughout the world. The Chinese people must demand blood debt from the Soviet revisionists.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY MOSCOW, January 25 - The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union held a "Meeting to Denounce the Soviet Revisionists' Bloody Suppression of Our Students in Europe" on the evening of the 25th, strongly condemning and protesting the Soviet military police and plainclothes agents' bloody suppression of Chinese students in front of Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square at noon that day.

	Chinese Chargé d'Affaires An Zhi Yuan first expressed his utmost indignation and strongest protest against the Soviet authorities' brutal beating of our revolutionary students. He represented the entire embassy staff in firmly supporting and highly praising the revolutionary enthusiasm and anti-revisionist courage of our students in Europe, and expressed his warmest sympathies to all the students who were beaten by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents. He said, "Our students paying respects to Lenin and Stalin's mausoleum with wreaths and singing the 'Internationale' is a perfectly justified revolutionary action."

	He stressed that the Soviet authorities sent military police and plainclothes agents to suppress Chinese revolutionary students, "which does not indicate their strength, but on the contrary, shows their extreme weakness, proving that they are paper tigers! They are afraid of Mao Zedong Thought, afraid of the truth, afraid of the 'Internationale,' they are afraid of revolution, afraid that the Soviet people will accept Mao Zedong Thought to rebel against them! But the truth cannot be stopped, Mao Zedong Thought must spread throughout the world."

	He said, "The students fearlessly, following Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' They read Chairman Mao's quotations and sang the 'Internationale' in the face of Soviet military police, this is our victory."

	He then pointed out, "Many of our students were injured, this is a glorious injury. Chairman Mao said: 'Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing,' the Soviet revisionists hate us so much, this shows that we are revolutionary, we are glorious!" He excitedly said, "Thousands of words cannot express our indignation and condemnation of the Soviet revisionists. This is the second time the Soviet revisionists have beaten our revolutionary youth in Moscow, they owe us a blood debt, which must be repaid. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, cause a great turmoil in the Cultural Revolution, cause a great turmoil in the world revolution, and strongly oppose revisionism, one day we will demand this blood debt from the Soviet revisionists."

	During his speech, he led all the participants in the meeting to loudly read the following quotation from Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful."

	Embassy staff representative Wen Xinwu said in his speech, "Comrades, your revolutionary actions are excellent! This action is a great blow to the Soviet revisionist leadership, who have betrayed great Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, they are terrified, as if facing a great enemy. They have used fascist brutality, mobilizing a large number of military police and special agents, heavily surrounding you. They wielded weapons to beat you, who were unarmed, and tried to trample on the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' Many comrades were injured and bleeding. In the heart of the great October Revolution, in front of Lenin's Mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square, the blood of our revolutionary youth was shed. You showed daring to fight, daring to win, and fearlessness in the face of violence. You were full of fighting spirit, shouting revolutionary slogans such as 'Down with modern revisionism' and 'Long live Chairman Mao.' Your revolutionary actions have won the strong sympathy and support of the Soviet people. You are truly Chairman Mao's good students. Your revolutionary actions are excellent!"

	The representative of Chinese students in France who were beaten by Soviet military police and plainclothes agents, Zhang Tiechen, angrily recounted the specific details of this extremely serious "January 25" Red Square bloodshed incident. He said, our great leader Chairman Mao taught us, "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The brutal actions of the Soviet revisionist fascist military police and plainclothes agents made us personally experience what revisionism is. We must always remember Chairman Mao's words and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country to the end, ensuring that China will never change color.

	The representative of Chinese students in Finland, Xie Lin Tao, also angrily denounced the fascist atrocities of Soviet revisionism at the meeting.

　　我驻苏联大使馆全体工作人员集会控诉苏修集团的法西斯暴行
　　毛泽东思想一定要传遍全世界
　　中国人民定要向苏修讨还血债
    新华社莫斯科二十五日电　中国驻苏联大使馆全体工作人员，二十五日晚上在这里举行“控诉苏修血腥镇压我留欧学生罪行大会”，最强烈地谴责和抗议苏联军警和便衣特务当天中午在莫斯科红场列宁陵墓前血腥镇压中国学生的罪行。
    中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远首先对苏联当局残酷毒打我革命学生的暴行表示极大的愤慨和最强烈的抗议。他代表全馆同志对留欧同学的革命热情和反修勇气表示坚决的支持和高度的赞扬，对被苏联军警和便衣特务殴打的全体同学表示最亲切的慰问。他说：“我国学生向列宁和斯大林的陵墓敬献花圈和高唱《国际歌》，是天经地义的革命行动”。
    他强调指出，苏联当局出动军警和便衣特务镇压中国革命学生，“决不说明他们强大，恰恰相反，表明他们极端虚弱，证明他们是纸老虎！他们怕毛泽东思想，怕真理，怕《国际歌》，他们怕革命，怕苏联人民接受毛泽东思想来造他们的反！但是，真理是阻挡不住的，毛泽东思想是要传遍全世界的”。
    他说：“同学们不畏强暴，遵循毛主席的教导：‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’面对苏联军警读了毛主席语录，唱完了《国际歌》，这就是我们的胜利”。
    他接着指出：“我们许多同学受了伤，这是光荣负伤。毛主席说：‘被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事’，苏修如此痛恨我们，这表明我们是革命的，是光荣的！”他激动地说：“千言万语难以表达我们对苏修的愤慨和谴责。这是苏修第二次在莫斯科毒打我国革命青年，他们欠下我们的血债，是必须偿还的。我们要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，大闹文化大革命，大闹世界革命，大造修正主义的反，终有一天我们要向苏修讨还这笔血债的”。
    在讲话中，他带领全体参加大会的同志高声朗读毛主席的下面一段语录：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”
    使馆工作人员代表温新武在讲话时说：“同学们，你们的革命行动好得很！这个行动对背弃了伟大的马克思列宁主义的苏联修正主义领导集团是一个很大的打击。因此，他们恐惶万分，如临大敌，他们竟使出了法西斯的残暴手段，调动大批军警特务，重重包围你们，他们手持凶器毒打手无寸铁的你们，并且企图践踏《毛主席语录》，许多同学流血受伤，在伟大十月革命的故乡的心脏——莫斯科红场列宁陵墓前洒下了我国革命青年的鲜血。你们在凶狠的敌人面前，表现了敢于斗争、敢于胜利，不畏强暴的革命精神。你们斗志昂扬，高呼‘打倒现代修正主义’‘毛主席万岁’等革命口号。你们的革命行动得到了苏联人民的强烈同情和支持。你们不愧为毛主席的好学生。你们的革命行动好得很！”
    被苏联军警和便衣特务殴打的我留法学生代表张铁臣，在会上愤怒地讲述了这个极端严重的“一·二五”红场流血事件的具体经过。他说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们，
  “捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”苏修法西斯军警和便衣特务们的残暴行动使我们亲身体会到了什么叫修正主义。我们一定要永远记住毛主席的话，坚决把我国的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证中国永不变色。
    中国在芬兰的留学生代表郄霖涛也在会上愤怒控诉了苏联修正主义的法西斯暴行。
