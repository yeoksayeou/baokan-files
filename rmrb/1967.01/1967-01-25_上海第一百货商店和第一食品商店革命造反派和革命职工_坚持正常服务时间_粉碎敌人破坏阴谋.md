Shanghai's two largest stores—the First Department Store and the First Food Store—revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers have smashed the plots of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and have recently taken revolutionary actions to restore normal service hours, earning the enthusiastic praise of the broad revolutionary masses.

In recent days, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Shanghai Municipal Committee and the commercial sector used money to bribe and corrupt commercial workers, shortening service hours to sabotage the policy of "seizing revolution and promoting production," creating contradictions between the commercial sector and the broad masses of consumers, and tarnishing the reputation of the Cultural Revolution. The capitalist-roaders in the First Department Store changed the service hours from 9 AM to 8 PM to 9 AM to 5 PM. The broad masses of customers were very dissatisfied and issued severe criticisms.

Under the inspiration of the central telegram, the revolutionary rebels of the First Department Store seized power from the capitalist-roaders. Initially, they faced great difficulties: under the influence of the counter-revolutionary economic trend, some service staff went out, and since many stores had already closed by the evening, customers flocked to the First Department Store, creating immense pressure. However, all revolutionary rebel members and revolutionary masses pressed forward in the face of difficulties, determined to restore normal service hours.

After intense preparations, they implemented this revolutionary action. The broad masses of customers enthusiastically praised them for holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and responding to Chairman Mao's call to "seize revolution and promote production" with practical actions.

Many revolutionary rebel team members and revolutionary workers of this store displayed the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, working continuously and voluntarily extending their working hours. More than twenty revolutionary rebels from the garment processing department, who had never stood behind the counter before, went to support the service work after their shifts. The members of the takeover committee, despite their busy work, still allocated most of their personnel to stand behind the counter. More than 200 Red Guards from East China Normal University, Beijing Institute of Machinery, Dongfeng Middle School, and other schools also rushed to participate in voluntary labor.

After taking over the store, the revolutionary rebel team of Shanghai's First Food Store restudied "In Memory of Norman Bethune," resolutely following Chairman Mao's instructions, and decided to restore service hours to 8 PM. The sales staff said: We firmly support the decision to extend service hours. If there are not enough people, we are willing to work from morning to night. The transportation workers firmly supported this revolutionary action, working day and night to transport goods, ensuring the supply of goods.

On January 22, the Wenhui Daily published an editorial titled "Oppose the Unreasonable Shortening of Business Hours," stating: A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Shanghai's commercial sector incited some sales staff to leave their posts to go out and link up, and incited some sales staff to delay starting work or close early. This was a deliberate attempt to create contradictions between commercial workers and the broad masses of consumers, inciting people to fight against each other, directly sabotaging production, and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. By doing so, they intervened between production and consumption, thinking they had gained the upper hand. However, this exposed their reactionary nature and also educated the broad masses: how pervasive counter-revolutionary economic trends are!

The editorial said: The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai's First Food Store have risen up. They have rebelled against this counter-revolutionary economic trend. Their revolutionary spirit of daring to take on heavy responsibilities is worthy of great praise. Revolutionary rebels are like this: wherever there are difficulties, they go there.

　　坚持正常服务时间　粉碎敌人破坏阴谋
    新华社上海二十四日电　上海两个最大的商店——第一百货商店和第一食品商店的革命造反派和革命职工，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋，最近先后采取革命行动，恢复正常服务时间，受到广大革命群众的热烈赞扬。
    前些日子，上海市委和商业部门中党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派用金钱收买、腐蚀商业职工，以缩短服务时间来破坏“抓革命，促生产”的方针，制造商业部门和广大消费者之间的矛盾，败坏无产阶级文化大革命的声誉。第一百货商店的走资本主义道路的当权派把原来上午九点至晚上八点的服务时间，改为上午九点至下午五点。广大顾客十分不满，提出了严厉的批评。
    在中央贺电的鼓舞下，第一百货商店的革命造反派夺了走资本主义道路的当权派的权。一开始，他们面临很大困难：在反革命经济主义思潮的恶劣影响下，部分服务员外出，由于许多商店到晚间都已关门，顾客集中到市百一店，压力很大，但全体革命造反派成员和革命群众迎着困难前进，决心恢复正常服务时间。
    经过紧张的准备，他们实现了这一革命行动。广大顾客热烈赞扬他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用实际行动响应了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。
    这个商店的许多革命造反队员和革命职工，发扬最大的革命热情，连续作战，主动延长工作时间。从来不站柜台的服装加工部的二十多个革命造反队员，下了班都去支援服务工作。接管委员会的同志们尽管工作特别忙，仍然抽出大部分人员去站柜台。华东师大、北京机械学院、东风中学等校二百多名红卫兵小将也赶来参加义务劳动。
    上海第一食品商店工人革命造反大队接管了商店以后，重新学习了《为人民服务》，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，决定把服务时间恢复到晚上八时止。营业员们说：我们坚决拥护延长服务时间的决定，如果人手不足，一个人从早顶到晚也心甘情愿。运输工人们坚决拥护这一革命行动，夜以继日地运货，保证了货源供应。
    一月二十二日，《文汇报》为此发表题为《反对无理缩短营业时间》的社论说：上海商业部门一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，怂恿一部分营业员离开工作岗位出外串连，怂恿一部分营业员推迟上班，或提前打烊。这是有意制造商业人员和广大消费者的矛盾，挑动群众斗群众，直接破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们这样做，在生产与消费中间插上一手，自以为得计，可是，这正好暴露了他们自己的反动面目，同时也教育了广大群众：反革命的经济主义是何等无孔不入的啊！
    社论说：上海第一食品商店的革命造反派起来了。他们造了这个反革命经济主义的反。他们这种敢挑重担的革命精神，值得大大发扬。革命造反派就是这个样，哪里有困难，就朝哪里上。
