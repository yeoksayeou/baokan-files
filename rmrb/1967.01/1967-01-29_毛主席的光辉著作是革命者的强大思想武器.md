Revolutionary rebels across the country enthusiastically welcome the re-publication of "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas within the Party"
Mao's brilliant works are a powerful ideological weapon for revolutionaries

This brilliant work, like a lighthouse, illuminates the path forward for revolutionary rebels. It will play a significant role in enhancing the revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline of revolutionary rebels. It will make the proletarian revolutionary forces more politically mature, continuously expand organizationally, and achieve greater victories in the struggle to seize power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road.

New China News Agency, January 28th: The brilliant work "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas within the Party" by our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao was published in today's newspapers. Revolutionary rebels in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, Xi'an, Shenyang, and other places enthusiastically welcomed it, unanimously agreeing that this brilliant work by Chairman Mao has great practical significance. It will play a significant role in enhancing the revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline of revolutionary rebels. Proletarian revolutionaries are determined to seriously study this brilliant work, linking it to their own thoughts and the practical struggles, actively learning and applying it. They will further realize the proletarian revolutionization of their thoughts, unite more closely under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and rally the broad masses of revolutionary people. They will seize various powers from those in power who are taking the capitalist road, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions.

Revolutionary rebel workers, students, and cadres in the capital enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the brilliant work "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas within the Party." Some revolutionary rebel organizations and revolutionary masses have already taken action, beginning to link thoughts and practical struggles, studying with questions in mind, and actively learning and applying the work. Some leaders and fighters of the revolutionary rebel group at the First Machine Tool Factory in Beijing carefully and repeatedly read this work, using it as a mirror to reflect on themselves, drawing nourishment and gaining strength from it. They said that the re-publication of this brilliant work is like a timely rain, helping us to wash away the remaining dirt and impurities in our minds, solving various problems in our thoughts and work, and guiding us to better implement the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries. Revolutionary rebels from more than ten organizations at the Beijing branch of the People's Bank of China and revolutionary students from the Beijing Public Security Bureau of the Central Financial and Economic College of the Communist Party of China expressed their enthusiasm: Chairman Mao's work was re-published at a crucial moment in the struggle for power, which is very timely and necessary. It is like a lighthouse, illuminating our path forward; it is like an alarm bell, making us vigilant against the growth of erroneous tendencies such as groupism, localism, and individualism. They resolutely declared that they would actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant work in the struggle, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, guide their actions, resist the infiltration of various non-proletarian thoughts, make the proletarian revolutionary forces more politically mature, continuously expand organizationally, and achieve greater victories in the struggle for power.

Revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai greatly valued the re-publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work. Five revolutionary rebel organizations at East China Normal University recently seized power from a small clique of those in power who are taking the capitalist road, establishing a unified revolutionary organization—the New East China Normal University Commune, and bringing about a new leap in the proletarian cultural revolution in the school. The leaders of the New East China Normal University Commune deeply felt that the various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies pointed out by Chairman Mao in this brilliant work can be summed up in one word: "selfishness." This selfishness is a corrosive agent that weakens our revolutionary forces and disperses the fighting power of revolutionary rebels, and it is the great enemy of all revolutionary rebels! We must rise up and attack it! We must rally together and annihilate it! They believed that the great achievements we revolutionary rebels have won through struggle are only the first step of a ten-thousand-mile journey. To keep the revolutionary rebel army forever young and vigorous, and to keep the revolution forever advancing, we must unanimously and resolutely criticize the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies in our ranks, further arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, rapidly enhance our proletarian revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline, and build our forces to be more proletarian and more combat-ready!

Revolutionary rebels in various colleges and universities in Tianjin enthusiastically welcomed the re-publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work. Many Red Guards said: This brilliant work is the military guideline of the People's Liberation Army. We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers and the reserve army of the People's Liberation Army. We must take this work as the guiding ideology of our revolutionary organizations, study it seriously, transform our thoughts, and forge ourselves into a highly proletarian and highly combat-ready force. The Red Guards of Nan Kai University's Weidong, during the rectification process before and after the New Year, repeatedly studied this brilliant work in conjunction with practical struggles. They deeply felt that the problems raised in this work are very sharp and have strong pertinence, hitting their own sore spots. In the past, the Weidong Headquarters had subjective tendencies in guiding work, lacked in-depth investigation and analysis of the objective situation, and sometimes commanded battles inaccurately. There were also tendencies of ultra-democracy in the Weidong Red Guards, weakening the fighting power of the revolutionary organization. They said that only by arming themselves with Chairman Mao's brilliant work and waging a struggle against various erroneous thoughts can they form a solid great alliance with other revolutionary rebels and strive for victory in the struggle for power.

Revolutionary rebels in Guangzhou enthusiastically expressed that they would seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant work, study with questions in mind, and actively learn and apply it. The Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Headquarters of the Central-South Bureau of the Communist Party of China published an article stating: Since we do not live in a vacuum and are in an era of fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts will inevitably infiltrate our minds. To not be defeated by the enemy, the most fundamental thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. At present, we must seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant work, overcome various erroneous thoughts in our ranks, and only in this way can we enhance our proletarian revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline, and forever stand unyielding.

Revolutionary rebels in the Wuhan area enthusiastically welcomed Chairman Mao's brilliant work, providing a powerful ideological weapon for proletarian revolutionary rebels. Revolutionary rebels of the "August 17th" Combat Team of the Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought at the Second Machine Tool Factory in Wuhan said: Proletarian revolutionary rebels cannot for a moment be separated from Chairman Mao's works. In the current good revolutionary situation, some comrades have developed tendencies of arrogance, complacency, factionalism, and ultra-democracy. Therefore, we must work hard to study this brilliant work, forge our revolutionary rebel forces into highly proletarian and highly combat-ready forces, and achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution. Revolutionary rebels at New Hubei University, when talking about their experience in studying this work, said: When we achieved the great alliance of revolutionary rebels, various contradictions existed among the revolutionary mass organizations in our school, and a new unified revolutionary rebel organization could not be established for a long time. In this situation, revolutionary rebel comrades throughout the school studied "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas within the Party," overcame tendencies of ultra-democracy, factionalism, and absolute egalitarianism, and developed the great alliance of revolutionary rebels, greatly enhancing their fighting power.

Revolutionary rebel organizations on various fronts in Chengdu enthusiastically welcomed the re-publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work by the People's Daily. The leader of the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps in Chengdu said that Chairman Mao's brilliant work is of great practical significance to our revolutionary rebel organization. We are currently facing the important task of how to further strengthen the fighting power of our organization and improve the political level of each member. All revolutionary rebel fighters in our entire corps are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely correct various erroneous tendencies, further arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, enhance their proletarian revolutionary, scientific, and organizational discipline, and forge this force into a highly proletarian and highly combat-ready revolutionary force. Comrades from the Headquarters of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Revolutionary Rebel Corps in Chengdu believe that the enemies we are currently facing are those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road and stubbornly persistent followers of the bourgeois reactionary line. These enemies are very cunning and require us to unite all revolutionary rebel organizations to jointly confront them. Revolutionary rebels must unite, and to do so, they must eliminate various erroneous thoughts and remove personal selfishness. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants' revolutionary rebels, must study and apply Chairman Mao's brilliant work well to grow politically, unite the broad masses, and achieve one victory after another.

Revolutionary peasants in the Xi'an area believe that the re-publication of this programmatic work by Chairman Mao is very necessary and timely. They believe that there are some erroneous tendencies within the revolutionary ranks in Xi'an, and if not eliminated, they will hinder the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries and affect the smooth progress of the revolution. They expressed their determination to study and apply this brilliant work with these problems in mind, transform their thoughts, rectify their style of work, adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and achieve new victories. All comrades of the Revolutionary Committee of the Military Communications Engineering Academy in Xi'an linked the practical struggles to study and discuss Chairman Mao's brilliant work and the editorial note of the People's Daily. They believed that currently, there are some erroneous tendencies within the revolutionary rebel forces in the Xi'an area that hinder unity and affect fighting power. A small clique of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road and stubbornly persistent followers of the bourgeois reactionary line are trying to use these erroneous tendencies in our ranks to create factions and disrupt our unity. We must be vigilant against this. We must use Chairman Mao's brilliant work as a weapon to resolutely struggle against various bourgeois thoughts, making the revolutionary rebels under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought more united and their fighting power stronger, completing the great task of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Many revolutionary rebel fighters in Shenyang immediately held a symposium and studied the re-publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work in the newspaper. Fighters of the "August 31st" Revolutionary Brigade of Mao Zedong Thought in Shenyang unanimously believed that Chairman Mao's brilliant work is a compulsory course for proletarian revolutionary rebels. They expressed their determination to actively learn and apply this work, overcome various erroneous tendencies that hinder the great alliance of proletarian revolutionaries, emphasize politics, have a broad vision, and unite more closely under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Fighters of the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel Brigade of Shenyang Agricultural College held a symposium with special affection. They said that we revolutionary rebels must seriously study this work, inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the Gutian Meeting, build the revolutionary rebel organization into a highly proletarian and highly combat-ready revolutionary force, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen the great alliance and unity of revolutionary rebels, enhance fighting power, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

　　毛主席的光辉著作是革命者的强大思想武器
    这篇光辉著作，像灯塔一样，照亮了革命造反派继续前进的道路。它对提高革命造反派的无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，将起巨大的作用；它将使无产阶级革命队伍在政治上更加成熟，在组织上不断扩大，在向党内走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争中取得更大的胜利
    新华社二十八日讯 我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，在二十八日的报纸上刊登以后，北京、上海、天津、广州、武汉、成都、西安、沈阳等地广大革命造反派热烈欢呼，一致认为，毛主席的这篇光辉著作具有伟大的现实意义。它对提高革命造反派的无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，将起巨大的作用。无产阶级革命派决心认真地联系自己的思想，联系斗争的实践，活学活用这篇光辉著作，使自己的思想进一步实现无产阶级革命化，在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下更加紧密地联合起来，团结广大革命群众，从走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺回各种大权，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    首都革命造反派工人、学生、干部，看到刊登《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作的报纸以后，热烈欢呼。一些革命造反派组织和革命群众已行动起来，开始联系思想，联系斗争实践，带着问题学，活学活用。北京第一机床厂革命造反派的一些负责人和战士认真地反复地阅读了这篇著作，把它当作一面镜子来对照，从中吸取营养，从中获得力量。他们说，这篇光辉著作的重新发表，就像下了一场及时雨，及时帮助我们冲洗自己头脑中残留的污泥浊水，解决我们思想上、工作上存在的种种问题，指导我们更好地实行无产阶级革命派大联合。中国人民银行北京分行的十多个革命造反派组织和中央财政金融学院北京公社八八战斗队的革命学生，满怀激情地说：毛主席这篇著作在夺权斗争的关键时刻重新发表，太及时、太必要了，它像灯塔，照亮了我们继续前进的道路；它像警钟，使我们警惕小团体主义、本位主义、个人主义等错误思想倾向的滋长。他们坚决表示，一定要在斗争中活学活用毛主席的这一光辉著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，指导自己的行动，抵制各种非无产阶级思想的侵蚀，使无产阶级革命队伍在政治上更加成熟，在组织上不断扩大，在夺权斗争中取得更大的胜利。
    上海各革命造反派团体极大地重视毛主席的这篇光辉著作的重新发表。华东师范大学的五个革命造反派组织最近刚从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺了权，建立了统一的革命组织——新师大公社，使学校的无产阶级文化大革命出现了新的飞跃。新师大公社的负责人满怀深情地把毛主席的这篇光辉著作，称为革命造反派的阳光、雨露和方向盘。他们从自己的斗争历程中深深体会到：毛主席在这篇光辉著作中所指出的各种资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮，归结到一点，就是一个“私”字。这个私字是削弱我们革命队伍、涣散我们革命造反派战斗力的腐蚀剂，是我们全体革命造反派的大敌！我们一定要奋起而攻之！群起而歼之！他们认为，我们革命造反派经过奋斗已经取得的重大成绩，只是万里长征走完了第一步。为了使革命造反大军永葆革命的青春活力，永不停顿，把革命永远推向前进，一定要一致的坚决的批判我们队伍中的资产阶级和小资产阶级的思潮，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，迅速提高无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，把我们的队伍建设得更加无产阶级化，更加战斗化！
    天津市一些高等院校的革命造反派热烈欢呼毛主席这篇光辉著作的重新发表。许多红卫兵小将说：这篇光辉著作是人民解放军的建军纲领。我们是毛主席的红小兵、解放军的后备军，一定要把这篇著作作为我们革命组织的指导思想，认真学习，改造自己的思想，把我们锻炼成非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的队伍。南开大学卫东红卫兵在新年前后的整风过程中，曾联系斗争的实践反复学习了这篇光辉著作。他们深深感受到，这篇著作问题提得非常尖锐，针对性强，句句打中了自己的痛处。过去卫东总部在指导工作上存在有主观主义，对客观形势缺乏深入调查和分析，因此有时指挥战斗不够准确，卫东红卫兵中还存在着极端民主化倾向，削弱了革命组织的战斗力。他们说，只有用毛主席这篇光辉著作武装自己头脑，向各种错误思想开战，才能和其他革命造反派结成巩固的大联合，争取夺权斗争的胜利。
    广州市广大革命造反派热烈地表示，要认真学习毛主席的这篇光辉著作，要带着问题学，活学活用。中共中央中南局直属机关革命造反联络总部发表文章说：由于我们不是生活在真空里，由于我们是处在无产阶级和资产阶级进行激烈斗争的时代，资产阶级和小资产阶级思想必然要侵蚀我们的头脑。我们要不为敌人所打倒，最最根本的一条就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在当前要认真学习毛主席的这篇光辉著作，克服我们队伍中存在的各种错误思想，只有这样，才能提高无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，才能永远立于不败之地。
    武汉地区的革命造反派热烈欢呼毛主席这一光辉著作，给了无产阶级革命造反派无比强大的思想武器。武汉第二机床厂毛泽东思想红色造反兵团“八·一七”战斗队的革命造反者说：我们无产阶级革命造反派一刻也不能离开毛主席著作。在当前一片大好的革命形势下，有的同志滋长了骄傲自满情绪和山头主义、极端民主化的倾向。因此，我们必须狠下功夫学习这篇光辉著作，把我们革命造反派锻炼成为非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的队伍，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。新湖北大学革命造反派在谈到他们学习这篇著作的体会时说：在我们实现革命造反派大联合时，我校各革命群众组织之间存在着各种矛盾，新的统一革命造反组织长期不能建立。在这种情况下，全校革命造反派的同志学习了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作，克服了极端民主化、小团体主义和绝对平均主义等不良思想倾向，使革命造反派的大联合有了发展，战斗力大大提高。
    成都各条战线的革命造反派组织，热烈欢呼《人民日报》重新发表毛主席的这篇光辉著作。成都工人革命造反兵团负责人说，毛主席的这篇光辉著作对于我们这个革命造反组织有很重要的现实意义。我们正面临着如何进一步加强我们组织的战斗力，提高每个成员的政治水平这个重大任务。我们全兵团的革命造反派战士，决心按照毛主席的教导，坚决纠正各种错误倾向，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，提高自己无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，使这支队伍成为非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命队伍。成都贫下中农革命造反兵团总部的同志认为，我们当前遇到的敌人是党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子。这些敌人是非常狡猾的，需要我们各个革命造反组织联合起来，共同对敌。革命造反派要联合起来，必须清除各种各样的错误思想，去掉个人的私心杂念。我们贫下中农革命造反派一定要学好用好毛主席的这篇光辉著作，才能够在政治上成长起来，团结广大群众，夺取一个又一个的新胜利。
    西安地区革命农民文革总会的革命造反者认为，毛主席这篇纲领性的著作的重新发表，是非常必要和适时的。他们认为，西安革命阵营内部存在着一些错误倾向，如果不加以肃清，就会妨碍无产阶级革命派大联合，影响革命的顺利进行。他们表示要带着这些问题，活学活用这篇光辉著作，改造思想，端正作风，坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，夺取新的胜利。西安军事电讯工程学院文革临委会的全体同志联系斗争的实践，学习讨论了毛主席的这篇光辉著作和《人民日报》的编者按。大家认为，现在，在西安地区革命造反派的队伍中，存在着一些妨碍团结、影响战斗力的错误思潮，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，妄图利用我们队伍中的这些错误倾向，制造宗派，破坏我们的团结。我们必须对此提高警惕。我们一定要用毛主席的这篇著作为武器，对于形形色色的资产阶级思想进行坚决的斗争，使革命造反派在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，团结得更紧密，战斗力更强，完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大任务。
    沈阳市许多革命造反派战士看见报纸上重新发表毛主席的这篇光辉著作，立即举行座谈会，进行学习讨论。毛泽东思想“八·三一”造反团沈阳工人总部的战士，在学习座谈会上一致认为，毛主席的这篇光辉著作，是无产阶级革命造反派的必修课。他们表示，一定要活学活用这篇著作，克服各种妨碍无产阶级革命派大联合的错误倾向，突出政治，胸怀全局，更加紧密地在毛泽东思想旗帜下团结起来。沈阳农学院毛泽东思想红卫兵革命造反团战士怀着特别亲切的感情进行座谈。他们说，我们革命造反派一定认真学习这篇著作，继承和发扬古田会议的革命传统，把革命造反组织建成为一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命队伍，以毛泽东思想为指导，加强革命造反派的大联合、大团结，增强战斗力，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
