	Singing the Red Sun in Our Hearts

	Last December, on one of the days, as the flight from Shanghai to Beijing was about to take off, members of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team at Hongqiao Airport, holding red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," joined the passengers waiting for the flight in loudly reciting the quotations. Among the passengers were four Japanese friends, who also joined the crowd, reciting the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in Chinese. Nearby, members of the Guinean sports delegation were reciting the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in French. As the recitation ended, the songs "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" filled the hall.

	The four Japanese friends stood up excitedly, holding hands, and sang once more the song they loved, "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," praising the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

	At this moment, the head of the Guinean sports delegation, Sambo Ali, filled with boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao, ran to the center of the hall and sang loudly a song he had just composed on the spot: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the people!"

　　歌唱心中的红太阳
    去年十二月的一天，从上海开往北京的飞机即将起航了，虹桥机场的毛泽东思想宣传队员们拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，同候机的旅客们一起高声朗读。旅客中有四位日本朋友，也和大家围在一起用中国话同声朗读《毛主席语录》。坐在邻近的几内亚体育代表团，也在用法语朗读《毛主席语录》，朗读的声音刚停，《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声就响彻了大厅。
    四位日本朋友很激动地站起来，手挽着手，再一次高唱他们喜爱的歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》，歌颂世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席。
    这时，几内亚体育代表团团长桑供·阿里怀着对毛主席无限热爱无限敬仰的激情，跑到大厅中央，放声歌唱了他即兴创作的一首歌曲：“毛主席万岁！中国共产党万岁！人民万岁！”
