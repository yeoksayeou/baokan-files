	Chinese students in Paris engaged in a heroic struggle on the night of January 27, protesting the bloodthirsty atrocities committed by Soviet revisionists against Chinese students in Moscow. Forty-nine Chinese students studying in Rennes, France, were brutally beaten and arrested by French police while on their way to the Soviet Embassy to deliver a protest letter. The Chinese Embassy in France has lodged a strong protest with the French authorities over the police's violent suppression of the Chinese students.

	The Chinese students, who were on their way back to China, were outraged upon hearing the news of the brutal suppression of Chinese students in Moscow by Soviet military and police. They decided to go to the Soviet Embassy in Paris that evening to deliver a protest letter.

	When the Chinese students, in an orderly manner, reached a point about 200 meters away from the Soviet Embassy, they were stopped by dozens of French police who had been pre-positioned there. The Chinese students, while complying with the police's demand to stop, sent representatives to negotiate with the police. The police unreasonably demanded that the students return the next day, but the Chinese students expressed their willingness to wait on the spot.

	After about ten minutes of negotiation, a large number of French police, totaling around 200, suddenly launched an attack on the Chinese students, surrounding them on three sides on the sidewalk and forcibly arresting them. The police savagely grabbed the students by the neck, pulled their ears, and dragged female students by their hair and braids into police cars. The Chinese students fought back bravely, but outnumbered, they were all arrested after about twenty minutes of struggle. During this process, all 30 male students and 19 female students were beaten by the French police. Some were beaten so severely that they bled profusely, and others sustained internal injuries. The police also desecrated the Chinese students' reverence for Chairman Mao, tearing up Mao's portraits and trampling on the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

	After the incident, the Chinese Embassy in France repeatedly protested to the French Foreign Ministry, demanding the immediate release of the detained students. On the morning of January 28, the first secretary of the embassy, Yi Suzhi, lodged a protest with the director of the Asian Affairs Department of the French Foreign Ministry, M. Manac. Yi pointed out that the French police had violently suppressed the completely reasonable and legal action of Chinese students delivering a protest letter to the Soviet Embassy, resulting in a bloody incident. The French authorities would be fully responsible for the consequences of this incident. Yi demanded that Manac immediately and unconditionally release the Chinese students. Manac, caught off guard, did not dare to reject the oral protest from the Chinese side and agreed to immediately negotiate the release of the Chinese students with the relevant authorities. At 3 PM, all the detained Chinese students were released.

	During the nearly fifteen hours of detention, the Chinese students were treated poorly. All male students were searched. More than twenty were crammed into a small cell of only six square meters, forced to sit on the damp floor, and denied food and water. However, the Chinese students displayed the heroic spirit of the new generation of Chinese youth under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. In resisting the French police's brutality, they supported and helped each other, fully embodying class camaraderie and comradeship. From the moment they were put into the police cars, they continuously recited Chairman Mao's quotations and sang "The Internationale" and other revolutionary songs. They loudly recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." This gave them boundless strength.

	On January 28, they sang "The Internationale" and marched out of the detention center with their heads held high. On their way back to their residence in a police car, each of them waved a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang revolutionary songs. Many citizens sympathized with them, giving thumbs up and waving goodbye. Some were so moved that they shed tears. Even some police officers said to the students, "France did wrong, I have never seen such brave and tenacious foreign students."

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Paris on January 29, thirty Chinese students boarded a plane this morning to return to China from Paris to participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They were part of the forty-nine students who were beaten and arrested by French police on the night of January 27.

	Chinese Ambassador to France Huang Zhen, embassy staff representatives, and Chinese student representatives went to the airport to see them off. The embassy staff pinned big red flowers on each of the students.

　　抗议苏修混蛋血腥暴行　反对法国警察野蛮镇压
　　我留法学生在巴黎进行一场英勇斗争
　　他们背诵毛主席语录高唱《国际歌》，坚持斗争终于胜利
    新华社巴黎二十九日电　中国留法学生四十九人二十七日晚在到苏联驻法大使馆递交抗议书的途中，遭到大批法国警察的无理殴打和拘捕。我国驻法大使馆对法国警察暴力镇压中国学生的行径，向法国当局提出严正抗议。
    这些中国留学生都是在法国勒恩市学习的。他们在回国途中来到巴黎。二十七日下午，当他们在听到中国留欧学生在莫斯科遭到苏联军警血腥镇压的消息时，十分愤慨，决定当晚全体前往苏联驻法使馆递交抗议书。
    当中国学生有秩序地来到距苏联使馆还有二百多米的地方时，便被几十个预先布置好的法国警察拦住去路。中国学生一方面按照警察的要求停止前进，同时派出代表同警察进行交涉。警察无理要求学生们次日再来，中国学生表示愿意就地等候。
    在交涉了大约十分钟以后，法国警察当局调集的大批警察已经到达，总共约二百人向中国学生发动突然袭击，把学生们三面包围在人行道上，强行拘捕。这些警察野蛮地卡着中国学生的脖子，揪着他们的耳朵，抓着女同学的头发、辫子硬往警车上拉。中国学生进行了英勇自卫，但是寡不敌众，大约经过二十分钟的搏斗，学生们全都被警察拘捕。在这个过程中，三十个男学生和十九个女学生都遭到了法国警察的殴打。有的人被打得头破血流，还有一些学生受了内伤。警察还公然践踏中国留学生对中国人民最敬爱的领袖毛主席的崇高感情，撕毁了学生带去的毛主席像，践踏《毛主席语录》。
    中国驻法大使馆在事件发生以后，多次同法国外交部交涉，要求立即释放被捕学生。二十八日上午大使馆一等秘书易素之，向法外交部亚洲司长马纳克提出抗议。他指出，法国警察对中国学生向苏联大使馆递交抗议书的完全合理合法的行动，进行暴力镇压，造成流血事件，法国当局要对这一事件的后果负全部责任。易素之要求马纳克立即无条件释放中国留学生。马纳克理屈词穷，未敢拒绝我方提出的口头抗议，同时答应立即向有关方面交涉释放中国学生。下午三时，被捕中国学生全部获释。
    中国学生在被拘捕的近十五小时中，受到了恶劣的对待。全部男学生都被搜身。二十多人被关在一间仅六平方米的小囚室中，学生们只能坐在湿地上，吃不到东西，喝不到水。但是，中国学生表现了中国青年一代在毛泽东思想教导下的英勇气概。在抵抗法国警察暴行时，他们彼此支援，相互帮助，充分发扬了阶级友爱和同志间的情谊。他们从被抓上警车的时候起，就不断高声背诵毛主席的语录，高唱《国际歌》和其他革命歌曲，他们高声朗诵毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这给予他们无穷的力量。
    二十八日，他们高唱着《国际歌》，昂首阔步地走出拘留所。在坐着警车返回住所的途中，他们人人挥着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，唱着革命歌曲。许多市民同情地向他们竖起大拇指，挥手致意。有的甚至激动地流下了泪。有的警察甚至也对学生说：“法国这样做是错的，我从来没有见过这样英勇顽强的外国学生。”
    据新华社巴黎二十九日电　中国留法学生三十人今晨乘飞机离巴黎回国，参加无产阶级文化大革命。
    他们是二十七日晚横遭法国警察殴打并拘捕的四十九个留学生的一部分。
    中国驻法国大使黄镇，大使馆工作人员代表和中国留学生代表到机场送行。大使馆工作人员给留学生们一一在胸前佩上了大红花。
