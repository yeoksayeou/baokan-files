The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is sweeping across the nation like a storm, engulfing both urban and rural areas. Revolutionary workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, and cadre members are uniting to launch a comprehensive counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line.

Workers and peasants are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Exemplary figures from the industrial, agricultural, and financial and trade fronts should stand at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao has said: Exemplary figures have three strengths and play three roles, namely, the role of taking the lead, the role of being the backbone, and the role of being a bridge.

Exemplary figures from the industrial, agricultural, and financial and trade fronts have, in the past, in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, followed Chairman Mao's instructions, emphasized politics, and made great contributions.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, many daring revolutionaries and rebels have emerged among the exemplary figures. They have firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, broken through numerous obstacles, resisted bribes, endured slander and threats, and fearlessly fought against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They have launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois reactionary line. At the same time, with the attitude of masters, and with a high sense of responsibility to the Party and the state, they have overcome various difficulties, led the masses to firmly hold their production posts, and completed their production tasks well. They are the vanguards and backbone of "grasp revolution, promote production," winning the praise of the revolutionary masses and truly being models nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought.

"Lead in a thousand ways, lead in ten thousand ways, but the most important thing is to lead in revolution." Only by carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution well can we ensure that our country does not change color, and that the steel, oil, cloth, grain, cotton, and other products we produce are for the people and serve the people. Otherwise, if revisionism and counter-revolutionary restoration occur, the working people will suffer twice, and no matter how much steel there is or how good the cloth is, what good will it do for the working people? Therefore, we must actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "concern yourselves with state affairs, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," actively participate in class struggle, and not just focus on production, "only grasping grain, cotton, and oil, without distinguishing between enemies and friends."

Exemplary figures are representatives of the masses, advanced banners, and have prestige and influence among the masses. When they rise up in rebellion, they are warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses, greatly encouraging and promoting the revolutionary struggle of the masses.

For this reason, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are very afraid of exemplary figures rising up against them. They use every means to try to pull the exemplary figures over to their side, using their prestige and influence among the masses to deceive the masses and suppress the revolution.

Some power-holders who are taking the capitalist road appropriate the credit for the work of exemplary figures, attributing the growth of exemplary figures to their own accounts, using the exemplary figures' unlimited love for the Party and Chairman Mao to protect themselves. Proletarian exemplary figures are those who have emerged from the struggles of the masses and grown through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works. Ultimately, they are the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, and are not "cultivated" or "elevated" by any leader. Our exemplary figures are precisely because of their unlimited love for the Party and Chairman Mao that they must resolutely overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line also use the honor of being a labor model as a means of threat and inducement. If labor models have selfish thoughts about honor and do not correct them, they will shrink back, fall into the trap, and take the wrong path in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and keeping our country forever red is the greatest honor for the entire Party and the people of the whole country. Proletarian exemplary figures should put revolutionary interests first, devote themselves wholeheartedly to the revolution, and not calculate personal gains and losses. A labor model said well: "If you are afraid of not being a labor model and do not dare to fight, then you are not worthy of being a labor model."

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line also use "you should consider your status" to stop the revolutionary actions of exemplary figures, attempting to make them maintain so-called neutrality, not speak out, and not take a stand. In fact, the status of proletarian exemplary figures is that of a model for the masses and a leader of the revolution. They should have a clear sense of right and wrong and a passionate love and hate. In the fierce class struggle, there is no room for neutrality. Straddling the fence is not acceptable, and being impartial is hypocritical. Some advanced figures have said well, "Neutrality itself is a form of protection." "Neutrality," regardless of subjective intentions, objectively plays a role in protecting the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and protecting the bourgeois reactionary line. Exemplary figures can only stand at the forefront of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to truly match their "status" and not lose their revolutionary character.

Some labor models, out of fear of making mistakes and losing their honor, hesitate and observe when facing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, lacking the resolve and courage to rebel. In fact, not daring to rebel is itself a mistake. Proletarian exemplary figures must absolutely not make such a mistake and should resolutely throw themselves into the furnace of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to be tempered.

Some labor models have been deceived and used by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, doing some wrong things. As long as these people admit their mistakes, correct their mistakes, and stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, actively participating in the revolutionary struggle, they are still good comrades. As for the few false labor models cultivated and bought by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, their ugly faces as running dogs will inevitably be exposed in the Cultural Revolution and be spit on by the masses. Expelling these scoundrels from the ranks of labor models is a good thing.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great test for everyone. Labor models should be tested in this great revolution and raise themselves. Chairman Mao calls on us to "grasp revolution, promote production." Labor models should shoulder both the burden of revolution and production, be the vanguards of the production front, and even more so, be the daring revolutionaries of the Cultural Revolution. Only in this way can they be worthy of being labor models of the Mao Zedong era.

"Count the heroes of the past, but look to the present." Proletarian labor models should strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, closely follow Chairman Mao in making revolution, and bravely advance in the great winds and waves of class struggle, making greater contributions to the Party and the people.

    劳动模范要站在无产阶级文化大革命的前列
    力平
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，正以排山倒海之势，席卷全国城乡。革命的工人、农民、学生、知识分子、机关干部，正在联合起来，向资产阶级反动路线开展全面的反击。
    工人农民是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。工业战线、农业战线和财贸战线等各方面的模范人物，应当站在无产阶级文化大革命的前列。
    毛主席说过：模范人物有三种长处，起了三个作用，这就是带头作用，骨干作用，桥梁作用。
    工农业战线和财贸战线等各方面的模范人物，过去在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，听毛主席的话，突出政治，做出了很大的贡献。
    无产阶级文化大革命兴起以来，在模范人物中，出现了许多敢于革命、敢于造反的闯将。他们坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，冲破重重障碍，不被拉拢，不受利诱，不怕造谣中伤，不怕威胁迫害，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作坚决的斗争，向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火。同时，以主人翁的态度，以对党对国家高度负责的态度，排除各种困难，带动群众坚守生产岗位，很好地完成生产任务。他们是“抓革命，促生产”的先锋和骨干，赢得了革命群众的赞扬，不愧为毛泽东思想哺育起来的模范。
      “千带头，万带头，最重要的是带革命的头。”只有把无产阶级文化大革命搞好，才能保证我们国家不变颜色，我们生产的钢铁、石油、花布、粮食、棉花等等，才能是人民的，是为人民服务的。否则，出了修正主义反革命复辟，劳动人民就要受二遍苦，钢铁虽多，花布虽好，对于劳动人民又有什么好处呢？因此，我们一定要积极响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，积极投入阶级斗争，决不能只是埋头生产，“只抓粮棉油，不管敌我友”。
    模范人物是群众的代表，先进的旗帜，在群众中有威信，有影响。他们起来造反，受到广大革命群众的热烈欢迎，对群众的革命斗争是很大的鼓舞和推动。
    正因为这样，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，十分害怕模范人物起来造他们的反。他们千方百计地要把模范人物拉过去，利用其在群众中的威信和影响，来蒙蔽群众，压制革命。
    有些走资本主义道路的当权派，贪天之功归为己有，把模范人物的成长记在自己的账上，利用模范人物对党对毛主席的无限热爱，来保他们自己。无产阶级的模范人物，是从群众斗争中涌现出来的，是在活学活用毛主席著作中成长起来的，归根到底，是毛泽东思想哺育的结果，并不是哪一个负责人“培养”、“抬举”出来的。我们的模范人物，正是由于无限热爱党，热爱毛主席，所以，更要坚决斗垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，还把劳动模范的荣誉作为威胁利诱的手段。劳动模范如果在荣誉问题上有私心杂念而不纠正，就会畏缩不前，以至上当，在无产阶级文化大革命中走上错误的道路。
    把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使我们国家永远保持鲜红的颜色，这是全党全国人民的最大荣誉。无产阶级的模范人物，应该以革命利益为重，全心全意为革命，绝不计较个人得失。一位劳动模范说得好：“如果害怕自己当不上劳动模范，不敢起来斗争，那就不配当一个劳动模范。”
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，还用“你要考虑自己的身份”来阻止模范人物的革命行动，妄图使他们保持所谓中立，不讲话，不表态。其实，无产阶级的模范人物的身份，就是群众的表率，革命的带头人，应该有分明的是非，热烈的爱憎。在激烈的阶级斗争中，没有什么中立的余地。骑墙是不行的，不偏不倚是虚伪的。有的先进人物说得好，“中立，本身就是保”。“中立”，不管主观愿望如何，客观上是起着保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，保护资产阶级反动路线的作用。模范人物只有站在无产阶级文化大革命的前列，才最符合自己的“身份”，才不失革命者的本色。
    有的劳动模范，由于怕犯错误，怕丢掉荣誉，因而在无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮面前表现犹豫，观望，缺乏革命造反的决心和勇气。其实，不敢革命、不敢造反，这本身就是错误。无产阶级的模范人物，绝对不能犯这样的错误，应当毅然决然地投身到无产阶级文化大革命的熔炉中去，经受锻炼。
    有的劳动模范，受了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的蒙蔽和利用，做了一些错事。这些人只要承认错误，改正错误，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线方面来，积极参加革命斗争，仍然是一个好同志。至于极少数为党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所培植和收买的假劳动模范，在文化大革命中必然要暴露出他们的工贼的丑恶面目，为群众所唾弃。把这些家伙从劳动模范的行列中清除出去，是一件大好事。
    无产阶级文化大革命，对每个人都是一场大考试。劳动模范要在这场大革命中经受考验，使自己得到提高。毛主席号召我们“抓革命，促生产”。劳动模范要挑起革命和生产这两副担子，既要做生产战线上的尖兵，更要做文化大革命的闯将。只有这样，才不愧为毛泽东时代的劳动模范。
    “数风流人物，还看今朝”。无产阶级的劳动模范，应当努力活学活用毛主席著作，紧紧跟着毛主席闹革命，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进，为党和人民做出更大的贡献。
