	Inspired by Revolutionary Model Operas
	Soldier Acrobatics Troupe  Mao Hanfei

	For a long time, acrobatics has been labeled by bourgeois reactionary "authorities" as a "superclass technical art." Some of our comrades in the past also mistakenly regarded acrobatics as purely entertainment, saying things like: "Acrobatics neither speaks nor has a plot, it cannot reflect life, and cannot directly serve politics," "it can only make people laugh and cannot educate the people," and so on. It seemed as if acrobatics could not be reformed and even tried every means to prove that it did not need reform. If someone dared to break the "rules" and slightly reform it, they would immediately face ridicule and opposition from bourgeois "authorities."

	The appearance of the Beijing operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "The Red Lantern" was like a torch, illuminating the arts world, shaking all ancient arts, and touching the souls of us acrobatics workers. When we acrobatics workers saw the reform of Beijing opera, not only did it fully utilize the original performance forms and singing styles, but it also extensively borrowed and absorbed the essence of other opera genres and folk arts, achieving full development, we could not help but ask ourselves: "The most stubborn feudal cultural fortress—Beijing opera—has been reformed, why can't acrobatics be reformed?" "Beijing opera has discarded things like the water sleeves, why can't we discard some of our items?"

	To reform, there must be struggle.

	The first difficulty encountered is ideological resistance. In the old society, there was a saying in the acrobatics world: "Fear not a thousand tricks, fear only one absolute trick." "With one absolute trick, you can travel south and north to make a living." Therefore, an actor often spends a lifetime practicing one item. But once acrobatics is reformed, the actors need to be arranged uniformly, and "group acts" increase greatly. Thus, some people feel that this affects their practice of "absolute tricks," worrying that if the old is broken, the new will not come out, resulting in a chaotic situation. This ultimately boils down to a conflict between selfishness and public-mindedness. This is a struggle between two roads and two worldviews. Based on this situation, we first focused on studying Chairman Mao's works, repeatedly studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," to transform our thinking, break away from selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and firmly grasp the ideological revolutionization of people.

	The struggle between two ideologies is also reflected in the debate over the form of acrobatics art. Some say: "Acrobatics is a national art." But what they mean by national is merely a pursuit of "the older the better" conservatism. Boots must have big cloud patterns, costumes must have small vests, and the backdrop must have ancient-style lanterns and red pillars, and so on. We did not pay attention to that, but followed Chairman Mao's teachings: use the past to serve the present, and innovate. We broke through the bourgeois reactionary "authorities" framework, and according to the content needs, we sing when we need to sing, and speak when we need to speak. Even in the "Umbrella Formation" item, we added singing accompaniment. This way, we successively created items like "Praise to Mao Zedong," "Heroes Fight at the South China Sea," "Capture the American Puppet Soldiers," and "Steel Eighth Company at the South China Sea Frontline" that reflect real life and promote Mao Zedong Thought. These items have received praise from audiences both domestically and internationally.

	The reform of Beijing opera has promoted our acrobatics revolution. In the practice of thoroughly carrying out the acrobatics revolution, we have felt even more deeply that this is a fierce class struggle. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. Under the leadership of the Military Commission, the General Political Department, and Comrade Jiang Qing, we will strive to create socialist new acrobatics.

    在革命样板戏的鼓舞下
    战士杂技团  毛寒非
    杂技艺术长期以来被资产阶级反动“权威”称为“超阶级的技巧艺术”。我们有些同志在过去也糊涂地把杂技看成是纯粹娱乐性的东西，说什么：“杂技一不说话，二无情节，不能反映生活，不能直接为政治服务”，“只能供人一笑，无法对人民起教育作用”等等。似乎杂技根本无法改革，而且还千方百计地证明它不需要改革。倘若有人大胆破一下“格”，略为改革一下，马上就会遭到资产阶级“权威”的讥笑和反对。
    京剧《沙家浜》、《红灯记》的出现，像一支火炬，照亮了文艺界，震动了一切古老的艺术，也触动了我们杂技工作者的灵魂。当我们杂技工作者看到京剧的改革，不仅充分利用了原有的表演形式和唱腔，而且又大量借鉴和吸收了其他剧种和民间艺术的精华，得到了充分的发展的时候，我们不能不向自己提出这样的问题：“最顽固的封建文化堡垒——京剧，都改革了，杂技为什么不能改革？”“京剧的水袖等都扔掉了，我们有些节目为什么就不能扔掉？”
    要改革，就有斗争。
    首先碰到的困难，就是思想上的阻力。在旧社会，杂技界有这么一句话：“不怕千招会，只怕一招绝”，“有一手绝招，就能走南闯北混饭吃”。因此，一个演员常常是一辈子就练一个节目。但杂技一改革，演员就要统一安排，“群活儿”大大增加。于是有人就觉得这样影响了自己练“绝招”，担心破了旧的，新的出不来，结果闹个鸡飞蛋打。这归根到底是一个私字和公字的矛盾。这是两条道路，两种世界观的斗争。根据这种情况，我们首先抓毛主席著作的学习，反复学习“老三篇”和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，改造思想，破私立公，狠抓人的思想革命化。
    两种思想的斗争，还反映在对杂技艺术形式的争论上。有人说：“杂技是民族化的艺术”。但他们所说的民族化，不过是追求“越古越好”的复古主义罢了。靴子上要有大云卷，服装要有小坎肩，布景要古色古香的宫灯、大红柱子等等。我们没理睬那一套，而是按照毛主席的教导：古为今用，推陈出新。我们冲破了资产阶级反动“权威”的框框，根据内容需要，该唱就唱，该说就说，就是在《空伞造型》的节目里，也加进了伴唱。这样一来，我们先后创作了《毛泽东颂》、《英雄大战南海湾》、《活捉美伪军》、《南海前哨钢八连》等反映现实生活，宣传毛泽东思想的节目。受到国内外观众的好评。
    京剧改革，促进了我们的杂技革命，我们在大闹杂技革命的实践中，又更加深刻地感到这是一场激烈的阶级斗争。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，在军委、总政和江青同志的领导下，努力创造社会主义的新杂技。
