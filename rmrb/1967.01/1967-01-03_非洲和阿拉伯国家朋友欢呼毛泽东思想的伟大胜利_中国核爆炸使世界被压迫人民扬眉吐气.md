Friends from some African and Arab countries continue to celebrate China's successful conduct of another new nuclear test.

Patriots from the Congo (Leopoldville) specially wrote a letter to the Xinhua News Agency's Cairo branch to express their warmest congratulations to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and all the Chinese people.

The letter pointed out that the success of China's nuclear test under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought is "also a victory for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against the American aggressors and their lackeys."

The letter said: "The continuous development of China's nuclear weapons makes all oppressed peoples around the world proud and shatters the imperialists' nuclear blackmail."

A young worker from Zanzibar, Tanzania, went to the Chinese consulate to express congratulations on behalf of his colleagues. He said, "The success of this nuclear test proves that once the people grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can create miracles." An assistant doctor from Zanzibar warmly shook the hand of a Chinese doctor working there and said, "The stronger your country becomes, the happier the African people are."

A Zanzibar worker said, "Let the imperialists tremble before China's new nuclear test. China mastering such powerful weapons is not only beneficial to the Chinese people but also to the people of the world." A Zanzibar youth said that China conducted a new nuclear test, "The Americans are scared to death, and people around the world are clapping with joy."

A young person from Iraq went to the Chinese Embassy in Iraq to express warm congratulations and said, "The success of China's new nuclear test is a victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also receives unlimited respect from people around the world."

An Iraqi worker said, "The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are now colluding to try to implement nuclear monopoly, threatening world peace. China's nuclear tests are completely necessary."

Workers in the spinning section of the Sana'a Textile Factory in Yemen heard the news of China's successful nuclear test and felt very proud. A worker named Salah said, "China mastering nuclear weapons is a heavy blow to imperialism and a great encouragement to the peoples of Asia and Africa."

Another Yemeni friend named Zabibah said, "China's successful nuclear test is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, proving that China is advancing by leaps and bounds year by year. This is the result of the Chinese people responding to Chairman Mao's call."
