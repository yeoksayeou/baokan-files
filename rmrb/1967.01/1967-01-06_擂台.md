The red flags flutter and the drums beat in the Daqing Oilfield. The arena is set, and a battle call is issued: The American imperialists and Soviet revisionists boast of their oil drilling prowess, disdaining China and flaunting their might. Who dares to pull the American imperialists down from their high horse? Who dares to trample the Soviet revisionists underfoot? Our chests are ablaze, and our hearts are filled with vigor. We dare to treat the enemy as mere dust.

	“I dare to come!”
	“I dare to come!”
	The voices thunder like thunder, and the momentum is like the sea.

	The "Spearhead" Drilling Team leads the charge,
	The "Iron" Drilling Team stands at the forefront.

	A hundred red hearts take the arena,
	A hundred iron fists take the battle call.

	The heroic spirit of Chinese petroleum workers,
	Learning from Yu Gong, with great aspirations and boundless courage.

	With a roar, they unbutton their shirts and open their chests,
	Revealing the four volumes of the Little Red Book, shining brightly.

	“With Chairman Mao leading the way, even if there are mountains of knives and seas of fire ahead, we are not afraid!”

	A hundred heroes ascend the drilling platform,
	Hanging up the targets set by the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

	The drilling platform is the battlefield against imperialism and revisionism,
	The drilling platform is the arena to surpass and defeat the Americans and revisionists.

	Come, roll up your sleeves and get to work,
	Tear off the paper tiger's mask of the American imperialists!

	Come, lift our feet and kick the Soviet revisionists to the clouds!

	The wind and rain howl, cheering and applauding.
	Lightning and thunder strike the drums and shout in praise.

	Chairman Mao's petroleum warriors fight against the heavens and the earth,
	Commanding the winds and clouds, displaying a heroic spirit.

	Without relying on modern weapons to fight hard battles,
	Relying entirely on Mao Zedong Thought as the commander.

	Thousands of difficulties flee before us!
	Ten thousand dangers kneel at our feet!

	Over three hundred days and nights pass so quickly,
	Victory reports come one after another!

	Our drilling team reaches the peak of one hundred thousand meters of drilling,
	The waves of joy surge and surge.

	Great Mao Zedong Thought is invincible,
	The enemy suffers another shameful defeat.

	Whoever dares to challenge us again,
	Will surely be kicked off the arena of the times!

	Note: The "Spearhead" Drilling Team and "Iron" Drilling Team of the Daqing Oilfield created a world record of drilling over one hundred thousand meters in 1966.

	The so-called "Heroic Drilling Team" of the Soviet Union had the highest annual drilling meters of forty thousand and eighty-six meters.

	In 1959, an American team created a record of ninety thousand and three hundred twenty-five meters of drilling in one year.

    擂台
    大庆油田　赵铭风展红旗舞，油田摆擂台。一声号令山河动，一张战表传下来：美帝老修石油钻井称霸道，蔑视中国把威风摆。哪个敢把美帝拉下马？哪个敢把老修脚下踩？火满胸，气满怀，敢视敌人如尘埃。
  “我敢来！”“我敢来！”声如雷，势如海。
  “尖刀”井队头前闯，
  “钢铁”井队站头排。（注）一百颗红心上擂台，一百双铁手把战表接过来。中国石油工人的英雄气概，学愚公，壮志多豪迈。呼啦啦，解开衣襟敞开怀，露出四卷红书放光彩。“有咱毛主席来带路，前边哪怕有刀山火海！”一百个英雄上钻台，把美帝老修的指标挂起来。钻台，就是反帝反修的战场，钻台，就是超美甩修的擂台。来！挽起衣袖干起来，把美帝纸老虎的画皮撕开！来！飞起我们的双脚，把老修踢到九霄云外！风雨呼啸呐喊助威，电闪雷鸣击鼓喝采。毛主席的石油战士斗天斗地，叱咤风云，一派英雄气概。不靠现代武器打硬仗，全靠毛泽东思想挂了帅。千难，在我们面前溃逃！万险，在我们脚下跪拜！三百多个日夜多么短暂，胜利的捷报接连传来！我们的钻井队登上钻井十万米的
  高峰，欢呼的浪潮汹涌澎湃。伟大的毛泽东思想战无不胜，敌人又遭到可耻的失败。哪个胆敢再来较量，照样会被踢下时代的擂台！
    （注）大庆油田的“尖刀”钻井队和“钢铁”钻井队，一九六六年创造了钻井超过十万米的世界纪录。
    苏联所谓“功勋钻井队”，最高一年钻井米数是四万零八百一十六米。
    美国一九五九年有一个队创造的一年钻井米数是九万零三百二十五米。
