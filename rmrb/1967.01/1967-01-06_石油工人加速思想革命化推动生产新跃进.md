Oil Workers Accelerate Ideological Revolution to Drive Production Leap

Our country's oil products, both in variety and quantity, can now be self-sufficient. Exploration, extraction, and refining technologies have reached world-class levels.

Workers say: This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a brilliant achievement of studying and applying the "Three Articles."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 5th, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, our country's oil workers, in the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966, studied Mao Zedong Thought more consciously and diligently, applied Mao Zedong Thought, carried out a revolution in their souls, and pushed the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. They accelerated the ideological revolution and achieved one victory after another on both the spiritual and material fronts, reaching new heights.

On the eve of the New Year, the oil industry front reported continuous victories. The 1966 national crude oil production plan was completed ahead of schedule by 35 days and exceeded the target. The production of major products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil all saw significant increases compared to 1965. The discovery of new oil fields, the completion of new oil wells, the commissioning of new refining equipment, the adoption of new processes and technologies, and the successful trial production of new products have brought about day-to-day changes in the face of China's oil industry. The new production capacity added in 1966 for crude oil and refining nationwide exceeds the total production capacity added during the entire Second Five-Year Plan. The number of technical innovations already implemented has reached over 20,000. Many high-level, cutting-edge oil products that imperialist and revisionist countries consider rare and refuse to sell to China, we can now produce. Currently, China's oil industry not only achieves self-sufficiency in both variety and quantity but also has reached the world's scientific and technological peak in exploration technology, oil extraction processes, and refining technology. Whatever foreign countries have, we have most of it; whatever foreign countries do not have, we are creating and will create.

All these achievements vividly demonstrate that Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the masses, becomes an inexhaustible force, a powerful spiritual atomic bomb. As the people of Daqing summed up their great victories: "Thousands of victories, tens of thousands of victories, all are great victories of Mao Zedong Thought; thousands of achievements, tens of thousands of achievements, all are brilliant achievements of studying and applying the 'Three Articles.'"

In 1966, when our country entered the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan, the broad masses of oil workers, to make China's oil industry reach a new height, studied Chairman Mao's books more consciously and seriously, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao's great instructions that every industry should become a revolutionary school that is both industrial and agricultural, both cultural and military, as well as Comrade Lin Biao's letter on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the industrial and transportation sectors, reached various enterprises. A new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works surged across the oil industry front. The broad masses of workers regarded studying Chairman Mao's works as the first need in life. Whether in the well site, by the drilling rig, at the dining table, or in the dormitory, one could see people eagerly studying Chairman Mao's works. Many workers' first task before going to work every day was to bring questions to read Chairman Mao's quotations, seriously act according to Chairman Mao's instructions in the shift, and after work, use Mao Zedong Thought to examine their thoughts and actions, summing up the day's work.

The broad masses of oil workers enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, studying the "Three Articles" as their motto, fiercely fighting against selfishness and establishing selflessness, carrying out a revolution in their souls. They said, "The 'Three Articles' are the three rulers, three mirrors, and three scales of revolutionaries. Often measuring, reflecting, and weighing with the 'Three Articles' can keep one's legs from weakening and spirit from fading on the revolutionary path, always revolutionary and always progressing."

In the process of studying Chairman Mao's works and under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, more and more people in China's oil worker ranks are striving to establish a communist worldview of not seeking fame or profit, not fearing hardship or death, dedicating oneself to the revolution, and everything for the people. They take Lei Feng and Wang Jie as examples, on their own work posts, willingly being the people's "old yellow ox," ready to be a screw in the revolution; in daily life, they are frugal and simple, honoring hardship, forever walking the "Long March" path of revolution; when it is necessary to sacrifice for the people's interests, they remain calm and unflinching. The heroic deeds of the 32111 drilling team fighting a fire and using their blood and lives to protect a gas field are a concentrated expression of this great communist worldview.

Comrade Lin Biao said, "When the masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they become the wisest and bravest, and can unleash boundless energy!" Oil workers in China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fear neither heaven nor earth in their struggle against nature, dare to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire; in mastering modern science and technology, they also fear no ghosts or superstitions, daring to tread paths where no one has gone before, daring to scale peaks where no one has climbed.

Since 1966, the entire oil industry front has launched a magnificent movement of workers designing, breaking the bourgeois technical "authorities" and the "expert" line. In this movement, the broad masses of oil workers study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to break through various shackles, smash the monopoly of engineering and technical personnel on design work, and become the true masters of science and technology, taking matters into their own hands to design. They display their skills in design, use their experience, and unleash their wisdom, causing many units' production to undergo earth-shaking changes. Technologically, many new and unprecedented feats have emerged, many of which have far surpassed the so-called world standards boasted by capitalist countries. The drilling workers of the 1202 and 1205 drilling teams in Daqing Oilfield launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in 1966, achieving a breakthrough in drilling with worker-designed wells, with both teams reaching the ten-million-meter mark in annual drilling footage, breaking the world record of 90,325 meters held by an American drilling team. The record of 102.32 meters of core sampling created by Shengli Oilfield in July 1966 also far surpassed the 55.17-meter long-core sampling world record held by France in 1964.

The young people of the microbial dewaxing experimental group at the Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, persistently study and apply Chairman Mao's works, overcome countless difficulties, and found a microbial strain with strong oil oxidation capabilities, solving the key problem of microbial fermentation dewaxing of oil.

    人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！
    石油工人加速思想革命化推动生产新跃进
    我国石油产品品种和数量都能自给自足，勘、采、炼技术登上世界高峰
    工人们说：这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是活学活用“老三篇”的辉煌成果
    据新华社五日讯　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的我国石油工人，一九六六年在波澜壮阔的无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，更加自觉、更加刻苦地学习毛泽东思想，运用毛泽东思想，在灵魂深处闹革命，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段，加速了思想革命化，从而在精神和物质两条战线上夺取了一个又一个胜利，登上了一个又一个高峰。
    新年前夕，石油工业战线捷报频传。一九六六年全国原油产量计划提前三十五天超额完成，汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油等主要产品的产量，都比一九六五年有大幅度增长。新油田的发现，新油井的建成，新的炼油装置的投入生产，新工艺、新技术的采用，新产品的试制成功，使我国石油工业面貌发生了日新月异的变化。一九六六年全国新增加的原油和炼油的生产能力，比第二个五年计划期间新增的全部生产能力还多。已经实现的技术革新项目，也达到了两万多个。许多高级的、尖端的，帝国主义、修正主义国家认为奇货可居、不卖给我国的石油产品，我国也都能制造了。现在，我国石油工业不但在品种和数量方面都能自给自足，而且在勘探技术、采油工艺和炼油技术上，也已经登上了世界科学技术高峰。凡是外国有的，我们绝大部分已经有了；外国没有的，我们也已经和正在创造出来。
    所有这一切成就，都雄辩地说明了：毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。正像大庆人在总结他们的巨大胜利时说的：“千胜利，万胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利；千成果，万成果，都是活学活用‘老三篇’的辉煌成果。”
    一九六六年，当我国进入第三个五年计划第一年的时候，广大石油工人为了使我国石油工业登上一个新的高峰，更加自觉、更加认真地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。毛主席提出的各行各业都要办成亦工亦农、亦文亦武的革命化大学校的伟大指示，以及林彪同志就工业交通战线活学活用毛主席著作写的一封信传达到各企业后，石油工业战线上广大职工掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动新高潮。广大职工把学习毛主席著作当作生活的第一需要，不论在井场上，钻机旁，饭桌边，宿舍里，到处可以看到人们在如饥如渴地学习着毛主席著作。许多工人每天上班前的第一件大事，就是带着问题选读毛主席语录，在班上认真地按照毛主席指示办事，下班后用毛泽东思想检查自己的思想行动，总结一天的工作。
    广大石油工人热烈响应林彪同志的号召，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，在灵魂深处闹革命。他们说，“老三篇”是革命者的三把尺子，三面镜子，三个天平，经常用“老三篇”来量一量、照一照，秤一秤，就能在革命路上腿不软，志不衰，永远革命永远进步。
    在大学毛主席著作的过程中，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，我国石油工人队伍中已有愈来愈多的人正在努力树立不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死，一心为革命，一切为人民的共产主义世界观。他们以雷锋、王杰为榜样，在自己的工作岗位上，甘当人民的“老黄牛”，愿做革命的“螺丝钉”；在日常生活中，艰苦朴素，以“苦”为荣，永走革命的“长征”路；在需要为人民利益献身的时候，脸不改色心不跳。32111钻井队血战火海，用自己的鲜血和生命保住大气田的英雄业绩的出现，正是这种伟大的共产主义世界观的集中表现。
    林彪同志说：“人民群众掌握了毛泽东思想，就变得最聪明，最勇敢，就能发挥无穷无尽的力量！”用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国石油工人，在同大自然斗争中天不怕，地不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯；在掌握现代科学技术过程中，也是不怕鬼，不信邪，敢于走前人没有走过的道路，敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰。
    一九六六年以来，全国石油工业战线展开了大破资产阶级技术“权威”，大破“专家”路线的轰轰烈烈的工人设计运动。广大石油工人在这个运动中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想，冲破各种框框，打破工程技术人员对设计工作的垄断，变成科学技术的真正主人，自己动手大搞设计。他们在设计中施展自己的本领，运用自己的经验，发挥自己的聪明才智，使许多单位的生产发生了翻天覆地的变化，技术上也出现了许许多多大名堂和新名堂，其中有不少已远远超过资本主义国家所吹嘘的世界水平。大庆油田1202和1205两个钻井队的钻井工人，一九六六年掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，在打井上大搞工人设计，全年钻井进尺双双登上十万米的高峰，突破了美国一个钻井队年进尺九万零三百二十五米的世界最高纪录。胜利油田一九六六年七月创造的一次取岩心一○二点三二米的新纪录，也把法国在一九六四年创造的五十五点一七米的长筒取心世界纪录远远甩在后头。
