		Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech at the banquet welcoming Comrades Kabo, Balluku, Shytura, and the Albanian military delegation is as follows:

		Dear Comrade Kabo,
		Dear Comrade Balluku,
		Dear Comrade Shytura,
		Dear Ambassador Nataneli,
		Dear Comrades and Friends:

		In the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrades Kabo, Balluku, Shytura, and the members of the Albanian military delegation have come from afar to be among us. We are very pleased. Now, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, I extend to you the warmest welcome.

		Comrades from Albania, you come from the front line of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle in Europe. I now express my highest respect to you, and through you, to the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian people, and the Albanian army under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha. The heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, have raised high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, resolutely opposed imperialism, resolutely opposed Soviet modern revisionism led by Khrushchev, resolutely opposed the Tito renegade clique in Yugoslavia, and resolutely opposed the reactionaries of all countries, achieving brilliant victories in the struggle. The Albanian people, united closely around the Labor Party, with one hand holding the hoe and the other holding the gun, have achieved tremendous successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The recent Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party has raised even higher the red flag of Marxism-Leninism and achieved great success. We extend our warmest congratulations on all this.

		Comrade Mao Zedong, in his congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, said, "Though we are separated by mountains and seas, we are as close as neighbors." Now, you are once again gathered with us, and we are very pleased. The peoples of China and Albania are like one family. The peoples of China and Albania are closely connected at heart, just as Comrade Mao Zedong has said, the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Albania will definitely unite, fight together, and win together.

		Just now, during our meeting, Comrade Kabo, in his speech full of revolutionary friendship, gave a high evaluation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong in China. This is a great encouragement to us. We will definitely work even better under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, using the achievements we have made to repay the high praise of the Albanian comrades.

		We warmly welcome you to visit our factories, rural areas, schools, and military units during your stay in China to see the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution there. We also hope that after your visit, you will give us your valuable opinions and comradely, friendly criticism.

		At present, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is undergoing a new battle. This battle was first launched by the revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai. Our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee support them and call on the workers, peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres throughout the country to learn from the experience of Shanghai, to act in unison, to seize the revolution and promote production, and to resolutely smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

		In the initial stage of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was first launched in the cultural and educational institutions and party and government organs in large and medium-sized cities. Once this revolutionary movement was initiated, the revolutionary torrent of the masses surged forward, developing from schools to society, from cities to the countryside, with an irresistible momentum. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, this movement is developing towards broader and deeper aspects and has become a nationwide class struggle. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved great victories, and the bourgeois reactionary line is beginning to collapse.

		However, a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and a small number of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, are unwilling to admit defeat and are reluctant to leave the historical stage. They have launched a new counterattack against us. At this moment, our great leader Chairman Mao decided to publish the "Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" by the Shanghai revolutionary rebel organizations, calling on the people of the whole country to launch a comprehensive offensive against the bourgeoisie and their agents. This is a great revolution that touches the souls of people, a fierce class struggle. The victory of this struggle is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. It will make our proletarian dictatorship more consolidated, ensure that our country advances along the road of socialism and communism, and make a great contribution to the international communist movement.

		The responsible comrades of our Party Central Committee will accompany you on your visits. You can believe that every comrade accompanying you will, in accordance with the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong, introduce to you the situation of the Cultural Revolution and, together with you, meet with representatives of various aspects in the Cultural Revolution. You will go among the revolutionary masses and hear their answers to various questions. You will feel that they study and apply Chairman Mao's works more effectively than we do. The fact is that we have learned a lot from them. We are inspired and encouraged as soon as we come into contact with them. You will feel that they love Chairman Mao immensely and enthusiastically study and master Mao Zedong Thought. They love the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha. They fully support the revolutionary cause of all the people in the world. You will also see that the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be able to defeat imperialism led by the United States, definitely be able to defeat modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and definitely be able to defeat the reactionaries of all countries. We will also definitely be able to defeat the bourgeoisie and their agents within our country.

		Now, please raise your glasses,

		To the eternal fighting friendship between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Albania,

		To the health of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the leader of the Albanian people and the most respected friend of the Chinese people,

		To the health of Comrades Kabo, Balluku, Shytura, Nataneli, and all the Albanian comrades present,

		To the victory of our common struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries,

		Cheers!

    周恩来同志在欢迎卡博、巴卢库、什图拉等同志的宴会上说
    中国人民一定在毛主席和林彪同志的领导下更好地工作，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    新华社十四日讯　周恩来同志在欢迎卡博、巴卢库、什图拉等阿尔巴尼亚同志宴会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的卡博同志，亲爱的巴卢库同志，亲爱的什图拉同志，亲爱的纳塔奈利大使同志，亲爱的同志们、朋友们：
    在毛泽东同志亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，卡博同志、巴卢库同志、什图拉同志，和阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团的同志们，不远万里，来到我们中间，我们感到非常高兴。现在，我代表我们伟大的领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文化革命小组，向你们表示最热烈的欢迎。
    阿尔巴尼亚的同志们，来自欧洲反帝、反修斗争的前线。我现在向你们，并且通过你们，向在恩维尔·霍查同志领导下的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民和军队，表示崇高的敬意。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，高举马克思列宁主义的革命大旗，坚决反对帝国主义，坚决反对苏联赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义，坚决反对南斯拉夫铁托叛徒集团，坚决反对各国反动派，在斗争中取得了辉煌胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民紧紧团结在劳动党的周围，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，取得了巨大的成就。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党不久前举行的第五次代表大会，更高地举起马克思列宁主义的红旗，取得了伟大的成功。对于这一切，我们向你们表示最热烈的祝贺。
    毛泽东同志在给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中说，“海内存知己，天涯若比邻”。现在，你们又和我们聚会在一起，我们感到十分高兴。中阿两国人民在一起，就像一家人。中阿两国人民心心相连，正像毛泽东同志说过的那样，中阿两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    我们刚才在会见时，卡博同志在他的充满革命友谊的谈话中，对毛泽东同志领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，给了高度的评价，这对我们是一个很大鼓舞。我们一定要在我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的领导下，更好地工作，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，用我们所取得的成就，来酬谢阿尔巴尼亚同志的崇高的称誉。
    我们热烈欢迎你们在中国期间，能够到我们的工厂、农村、学校和军队中去，参观那里的无产阶级文化大革命。我们还希望你们在参观后提出宝贵的意见，给予我们同志式的友好的批评。
    现在，我们的无产阶级文化大革命，正在经历着一场新的战斗。这场战斗是上海的革命造反组织首先发动的。我们的伟大领袖毛主席和党中央支持他们，并且号召全国的工人、农民、革命学生和革命干部，学习上海的经验，一致行动起来，抓革命，促生产，坚决粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命的初期，首先是从大中城市的文教单位和党政机关发动起来的。这个革命运动一经掀起，群众的革命洪流，便汹涌澎湃，从学校发展到社会，从城市发展到农村，其势迅猛异常，不可阻挡。在毛泽东同志的领导下，这个运动正在向更广阔、更深入的方面发展，而成为全国全面的阶级斗争。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了伟大的胜利，资产阶级反动路线开始全线崩溃。
    可是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，还不甘心失败，不肯退出历史舞台，向我们进行了新的反扑。就在这个时候，我们的伟大领袖毛主席决定发表上海革命造反组织的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，号召全国人民向资产阶级和它们的代理人，进行全面的总攻击。这是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，是一场激烈的阶级斗争。这个斗争的胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。它将使我国的无产阶级专政更加巩固，保证我国沿着社会主义和共产主义道路前进，并且对国际共产主义运动作出重大的贡献。
    我们党中央的负责同志，将分别陪同你们去参观。你们可以相信，陪同你们参观的每一位同志，都会按照毛泽东同志指示的精神，向你们介绍文化大革命的情况，并同你们一起，会见在文化大革命中的各方面的代表人物。你们到革命的群众当中，会听到他们对各种问题的回答。你们会感到他们活学活用毛主席著作，比我们更好。事实完全是这样，我们的许多知识就是从他们那里学来的。我们和他们一接触就可以得到力量，得到鼓舞。你们会感到，他们无比热爱毛主席，热情地学习和掌握毛泽东思想。他们热爱以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。他们完全支持全世界人民的革命事业。你们也会看到，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众，一定能够战胜以美国为首的帝国主义，一定能够战胜以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，一定能够战胜各国反动派。我们也一定能够战胜国内的资产阶级和它们的代理人。
    现在，请大家举杯，
    为中阿两党、两国和两国人民的永恒的战斗友谊，
    为阿尔巴尼亚人民的领袖、中国人民最敬爱的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志的健康，
    为卡博同志、巴卢库同志、什图拉同志、纳塔奈利同志和在座的全体阿尔巴尼亚同志的健康，
    为我们共同的反帝、反修和反对各国反动派斗争的胜利，
    干杯！
