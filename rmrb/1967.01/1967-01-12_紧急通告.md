Title: Urgent Notice
Author:
Date: 1967-01-12
Edition: 2

Following the release of the "Letter to All People of Shanghai" by eleven revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, on January 9, the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 31 other revolutionary rebel organizations issued an "Urgent Notice" in the *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily*. Both newspapers published a quote from Chairman Mao: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The newspapers also published editorial notes.

The editorial note in the *Wenhui Daily* stated: We fully support the ten points proposed in the "Urgent Notice." We hope that all revolutionary rebels in the city will seriously implement these ten points.

Currently, the widespread trend of economism is a serious issue that demands attention. This is a new counterattack by the bourgeois reactionary line against the proletarian revolutionary line. A small clique within the Shanghai Municipal Committee who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, having already begun to disintegrate politically, will inevitably launch a new attack on the economic front. This new attack is directly aimed at the proletarian headquarters and directly opposes Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." We must resolutely repel this new counterattack by the bourgeois reactionary line.

Any actions that disrupt production, damage national finances, and sabotage the Cultural Revolution are counter-revolutionary actions. Revolutionary rebels and revolutionary workers must take action, fully implement the directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," expose the new plots of the small clique within the Shanghai Municipal Committee who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, and firmly defend their production and construction posts. They must strive to improve production and achieve double victories in the Cultural Revolution and production!

The editorial note in the *Liberation Daily* stated: Following the release of the "Letter to All People of Shanghai," the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and other revolutionary rebel organizations have issued an "Urgent Notice." This notice is of great importance. We express our most resolute support. The notice points out a serious issue in the current proletarian Cultural Revolution: a small clique within the Shanghai Municipal Committee who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are playing new tricks, sabotaging the proletarian Cultural Revolution, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and opposing Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production"; they even attempt to use material incentives to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses. Revolutionary rebel comrades and the broad revolutionary masses have timely exposed this major plot and smashed it. This is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Economism and material incentives are thoroughly reactionary revisionist trash. The broad revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought resolutely reject these worthless items; they fully understand that the proletarian Cultural Revolution is to eliminate bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements, to break down private interests and establish public interests, to reform people's souls, achieve the ideological revolution of the people, uproot the roots of revisionism, and consolidate and develop the socialist system. The ten points proposed in the "Urgent Notice" reflect the common will of the revolutionary masses, represent the highest interests of the proletariat, and once again strongly strike against the new counterattack by the bourgeois reactionary line. All relevant departments must resolutely implement and seriously execute these points.

The full text of the "Urgent Notice" is as follows:

At present, when the proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai is entering a decisive battle between the two lines, and when the Shanghai Municipal Committee, which stubbornly pushes the bourgeois reactionary line, is being overthrown, a small clique within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are playing new tricks. They collude with capitalist forces in society, using economic and welfare issues to divert the direction of the struggle, inciting masses to fight against masses, causing factories to stop production, railways to be disrupted, roads to be blocked, and even inciting port workers to stop production, affecting port operations, and damaging China's international prestige. They squander national wealth, arbitrarily increase wages and welfare, issue various allowances indiscriminately, and incite the masses to seize public housing. This is a new form of the Shanghai Municipal Committee's insistence on implementing the bourgeois reactionary line.

The small clique within the Party who are taking the capitalist road use these despicable and treacherous means to achieve the following: First, to disrupt production, interrupt transportation, and harm the national economy and people's livelihood to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose the Party Central Committee, and put pressure on the Central Cultural Revolution Group, aiming to sabotage the proletarian Cultural Revolution. Second, to use economic and welfare issues to divert the direction of the struggle, attempting to turn a serious political struggle into an economic struggle, and at the same time use material interests to corrupt the revolutionary will of the masses, promoting peaceful evolution and allowing bourgeois ideology to run rampant.

Therefore, we solemnly warn the Shanghai Municipal Committee that any attempt to disrupt production, interrupt transportation, and increase wages and welfare to divert the direction of the struggle will be absolutely unsuccessful. Revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought will resolutely expose this plot and resolutely repel the attack of the bourgeois reactionary tide. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," actively participate in the proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly defend our production and construction posts, adhere to the eight-hour workday, strive to complete and overfulfill production plans, and strive for high-quality products. We believe that the revolutionary masses of workers have a high sense of political responsibility for the great socialist motherland and will definitely put "public" first, handle the above issues from the perspective of national interests, and achieve double victories in the Cultural Revolution and production.

Revolutionary rebel comrades throughout the city, to quickly reverse the serious situation caused by the Shanghai Municipal Committee in social production, we appeal to everyone:

1. Revolutionary rebel workers, cadres, and students must resolutely implement and execute Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," actively participate in the Cultural Revolution, and at the same time firmly defend their production posts, becoming models of "grasp revolution, promote production."

2. We appeal to revolutionary rebels nationwide to take immediate action, persuade, and mobilize Shanghai workers, cadres, enterprise and institution staff, apprentices, and others who are visiting various places to return to Shanghai immediately, carry out the Cultural Revolution in their units, and overfulfill the 1967 production plan.

3. All travel permits issued by various units' authorities are immediately invalidated starting today. All travel expenses (excluding transportation fees) issued by various units are to be recovered by the authorities who issued them (can be repaid in installments).

4. Except for necessary production funds, wage payments, Cultural Revolution funds, office expenses, and other legitimate expenses, the circulating funds of all units, organizations, enterprises, and institutions are to be frozen starting today, supervised by revolutionary rebel and revolutionary mass organizations, and executed by municipal and various level financial departments to ensure that the national economy is not damaged (excluding deposits in banks by the masses).

5. To avoid diverting the direction of the struggle, issues regarding wage adjustments, wage back payments, and welfare benefits are to be handled in the later stages of the movement (special cases to be reported to the Central Committee for separate handling).

6. Students combining with workers and peasants is the necessary path for students to change their worldview and carry out the Cultural Revolution. Some authorities, to incite workers' dissatisfaction with students, disrupt the combination of work and study, and promote peaceful evolution, have issued relatively high labor wages to students. This is completely a revisionist trick and is strictly prohibited starting today.

7. All public housing and confiscated capitalist houses are state-owned property. They will be arranged by the state in the later stages of the movement. No one is allowed to seize public housing. Violators will be dealt with by the public security bureau. Those who incite residents to seize public housing will be dealt with according to the severity of the offense. Those who have moved into seized houses are to move back to their original places within one week.

8. Strengthen proletarian dictatorship. Those who oppose Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and sabotage the Cultural Revolution and production are to be immediately arrested by the public security bureau. Those who disrupt social order, assault people, rob, and steal others' property during the movement are to immediately return the stolen items and be dealt with according to the severity of the offense; those who commit serious offenses or repeatedly offend will be severely punished.

9. The above points are to be immediately implemented and executed by all units' rebel organizations and the revolutionary masses throughout the city. All propaganda machines are to be activated for propaganda and education.

10. The above points are to be executed by the Municipal Committee and the Public Security Bureau. Those who violate the above points are to be dealt with immediately as saboteurs of the Cultural Revolution.

### 紧急通告

    紧急通告
    新华社上海十一日电　继上海十一个革命造反组织发表《告上海全市人民书》之后，一月九日，上海工人革命造反总司令部等三十二个革命造反组织又在《文汇报》《解放日报》发出了《紧急通告》。《文汇报》和《解放日报》在发表这项《紧急通告》的时候，都刊登了毛主席的一段语录：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”两报还分别发表了编者按。
    《文汇报》的编者按说：我们全力支持《紧急通告》的十条意见。我们希望全市革命造反派认真执行这十条意见。
    目前，经济主义思潮的泛滥，是一个值得严重注意的问题。这是资产阶级反动路线向无产阶级革命路线的新反扑。上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，在政治上已开始瓦解了，便必然要从经济上来发动新的进攻。这场新的进攻，其矛头直接针对无产阶级的司令部，直接针对毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。我们必须最最坚决击退资产阶级反动路线的这种新反扑。
    任何破坏生产、破坏国家财政金融、破坏文化大革命的行为，都是反革命的行为。广大革命造反派和革命职工行动起来，不折不扣地贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针，一面揭穿上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线的人的新阴谋，一面坚守生产和建设岗位，把生产搞好，努力夺取文化革命和生产的双胜利！
    《解放日报》的编者按说：上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命造反派组织，继发表《告上海全市人民书》之后，又发出了一个《紧急通告》。这个通告十分重要。我们表示最坚决的支持。这个通告指出了当前无产阶级文化大革命中的一个严重的问题：上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，正在玩弄新的花招，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，对抗毛主席的革命路线，对抗毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针；并妄图用物质刺激来腐蚀群众的革命意志。革命造反派的同志和广大革命群众及时识破了这个大阴谋，粉碎了这个大阴谋。这是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利！
    经济主义，物质刺激，是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义货色。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命群众坚决不要这些破烂货；他们完全懂得，无产阶级文化大革命，就是要灭资兴无，破私立公，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，挖掉修正主义根子，巩固和发展社会主义制度。《紧急通告》所提出的十条意见，正是反映了革命群众的共同意愿，代表了无产阶级的最高利益，再一次有力地打击了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。各有关部门必须坚决贯彻，认真执行。
    《紧急通告》全文如下：
    目前，正当上海无产阶级文化大革命进入两条路线决战的时候，正当顽固推行资产阶级反动路线的上海市委被打倒的时候，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派又玩弄新的阴谋。他们与社会上资本主义势力相结合，以经济福利问题来转移斗争的大方向，挑动群众斗群众，造成工厂停工，铁路中断，公路阻塞，甚至挑动港务工人停止生产，影响港口工作，破坏我国国际威望。他们任意挥霍国家财富，随意增加工资、福利，滥发各种补助费，煽动群众强占公房。这是上海市委坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的新形式。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派采取这种卑鄙阴险的手段，无非是为了：一、以破坏生产、中断交通、危害国计民生来对抗毛主席，对抗党中央，对中央文化革命小组施加压力，以达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的。二、利用经济福利问题来转移斗争的大方向，企图把一场严肃的政治斗争引入经济斗争的邪路上去，同时以物质利益来腐蚀群众的革命意志，推行和平演变，使资产阶级思想泛滥成灾。
    为此，我们严正警告上海市委，任何妄图用破坏生产、中断交通和增加工资福利来转移斗争视线的阴谋，都是绝对不能得逞的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命造反派，坚决揭露这个阴谋，坚决打退资产阶级反动思潮的进攻。我们一定要坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，一方面积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，一方面坚守生产和建设岗位，坚持八小时工作制，努力完成和超额完成生产计划，并且力争产品的高质量。我们相信革命的广大工人群众，对伟大的社会主义祖国有高度的政治责任感，一定能“公”字当头，从国家整体利益出发，正确地处理上述问题，夺取文化革命和生产的双胜利。
    全市的革命造反派战友们，为了迅速扭转由上海市委在社会生产上所造成的严重局面，我们呼吁大家：
    一、革命造反派的工人、机关干部、学生，必须坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，积极参加文化大革命，同时又要坚守生产岗位，成为“抓革命，促生产”的模范。
    二、呼吁全国革命造反派立即行动起来，说服、动员在各地串连的上海工人、机关干部、企业事业工作人员、艺徒等立即回沪，搞好本单位文化大革命，超额完成一九六七年生产计划。
    三、凡过去由各单位当权派签发的外出串连证明，即日起一律作废，各单位发出的大量串连费（车费除外），一律由当权派签发者负责追回（可分期退还）。
    四、除必要的生产经费、工资开支、文化革命经费、办公经费及其他正当经费外，各机关、团体、企业事业单位的流动资金，自即日起一律冻结，由革命造反派、革命群众联合组织监督市级和各级财务机关执行，以保证国家经济不受损失（群众在银行的存款除外）。
    五、为了避免转移斗争大方向，关于工资调整、工资补发、福利待遇等，原则上放到运动后期再作处理（特殊情况请示中央另作处理）。
    六、学生与工农相结合，是学生改造世界观，搞好文化大革命的必由之路。有些当权派为了挑起工人对学生的不满，破坏工学结合，对学生进行“和平演变”，竟发放较高的劳动工资，这完全是修正主义的一套，即日起，一律不准发放。
    七、所有公房及没收的资本家房屋都是全民所有制财产，运动后期由国家统一安排，不准任何个人强占公房，违者由公安局查处。凡怂恿居民抢占公房者，按情节轻重，依法处理。凡已住入抢占来的房屋者，限一周内搬回原处。
    八、加强无产阶级专政，凡是反对毛主席、林副主席、中央文革及破坏文化大革命、破坏生产者，立即由公安局依法逮捕。凡在运动中破坏社会治安、打人行凶、抢劫和偷盗别人财物者，应立即交回赃物，并按情节轻重依法处理；以后重犯或屡教不改者必从严惩处。
    九、上述各条，希各单位造反派组织和全市广大革命群众立即贯彻执行，开动一切宣传机器，进行宣传教育。
    十、上述各条，责令市委、公安局照此执行，凡有违犯上述各条者，立即以破坏文化大革命查处。
