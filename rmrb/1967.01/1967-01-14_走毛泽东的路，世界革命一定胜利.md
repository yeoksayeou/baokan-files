	Follow the path of Mao Zedong, make a great revolution in the world—this is the unanimous conclusion and shared resolve of the revolutionary peoples of the five continents.

	To follow the path of Mao Zedong and make a great revolution—this means to raise high the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao's theory on party building, to establish a genuine proletarian party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as the core of the revolution's leadership.

	In the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, new-type Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations have emerged in various countries around the world and are growing stronger and more consolidated. They are striving to build their parties according to Chairman Mao's theory on party building into genuine revolutionary parties. Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of various countries say that Mao Zedong Thought is their "unified program of action," "highest directive," "compass," "guide," and "beacon." The leader of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninists) pointed out: "Learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the center of our work and practice"; leaders of the Communist Party of Belgium, the New Zealand Communist Party, the Malayan Communist Party, and the Lebanese Socialist Revolutionary Party, as well as revolutionary leaders of Colombia, have all, in their decisions, speeches, and articles, pointed out that revolutionaries must take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide for revolutionary action and as the Marxist-Leninist standard for struggle in politics, ideology, theory, and organization. The organ of the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization, the newspaper *Uncompromising*, emphasized that only the new-type Marxist-Leninists nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought can be worthy of the glorious title of communists of this great era.

	To follow the path of Mao Zedong and make a great revolution—this means to raise high the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao's thoughts on armed struggle and people's war, to use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence.

	Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that "the central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war" is arming more and more revolutionary peoples. In Vietnam, the focal point of the world's anti-American struggle, the Vietnamese people, hailed as "tiger-slaying" heroes, are fighting stronger and stronger in their resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, achieving great victories. Therefore, they feel particularly close to Mao Zedong Thought. A hero from South Vietnam said: "Chairman Mao's military thought is the most correct theory for the proletariat and oppressed nations to struggle for liberation. Chairman Mao's people's war thought is the magic weapon for the world's revolutionary peoples to defeat the enemy." The Lao people, who are bravely fighting against the most ferocious American wolves, praise Chairman Mao's people's war thought as "one of the greatest and most outstanding creations," which has made an extremely great contribution to the liberation movement of oppressed nations. The Thai people who have risen in revolt, and the Malayan and Filipino peoples who are persisting in armed struggle, are all learning and applying Chairman Mao's military thought in the midst of war. The fighters of the Congolese (Leopoldville) patriotic armed forces, who are consolidating rural base areas and strengthening the construction of people's armies, point out that in their struggle against American imperialism and its accomplices and running dogs, they have summed up experience, proving that Chairman Mao's thesis that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is completely correct, and this is the only correct path for the Congolese (Leopoldville) people to achieve liberation. The flames of armed struggle are also burning in Angola, Mozambique, Portuguese Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Zimbabwe, Cameroon, and South West Africa. In Latin America, which has long been considered the "backyard" of the United States, revolutionaries in Peru, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic have all taken up arms, carrying Chairman Mao's works, and entered the mountains and forests to fight. A Mexican worker pointed out: The peoples of Latin America must advance in the direction and on the path indicated by Chairman Mao! The peoples of various countries say that the fallacy of "peaceful transition" propagated by modern revisionists has been exposed.

	To follow the path of Mao Zedong and make a great revolution—this means to raise high the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao's theory on the alliance between workers and peasants, to develop and strengthen revolutionary forces on the basis of a solid alliance between the working class and the peasants.

	More and more revolutionaries around the world are recognizing and applying the thought that revolution must rely on the peasants, establish rural revolutionary base areas, encircle the cities from the countryside, and ultimately seize national victory. The Lao Patriotic Front is implementing a broad policy of unity in its struggle, carrying out the three major tasks of armed struggle, mobilizing the masses, and developing production, and has established revolutionary base areas, with the revolutionary struggle continuously developing. The patriotic armed forces of Angola are establishing the thought of building rural base areas, and their relationship with the people is becoming closer, preparing the conditions for new victories. Revolutionaries in some other capitalist countries also say that Chairman Mao's judgments have profound guiding significance for their struggles, and they will certainly advance to victory under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	To follow the path of Mao Zedong and make a great revolution—this means to raise high the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao's theory on the international united front, to unite more than ninety percent of the people of the world, to form the broadest and most genuine anti-American united front, to overthrow the most ferocious common enemy of the peoples of the world, American imperialism.

	In his congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, Chairman Mao called on "all Marxist-Leninists of the world to unite, all revolutionary peoples of the world to unite, to overthrow imperialism, to overthrow modern revisionism, to overthrow the reactionaries of all countries." Revolutionary peoples of various countries are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, determined to unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to fight for the establishment of a new world. The leader of the New Zealand Communist Party pointed out that Chairman Mao's congratulatory message "deeply embodies the spirit of proletarian internationalism and Marxist-Leninist revolution," and it is "the bugle call to mobilize the peoples of various countries to unite and advance towards the only correct path to victory." Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a new and more intense anti-American revolutionary storm is rising all over the world.

	To follow the path of Mao Zedong and make a great revolution—this means to raise high the brilliant banner of Chairman Mao's theory on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, to carry the revolution through to the end, to turn humanity's most beautiful ideal into reality.

	The series of theories proposed by Chairman Mao on socialist revolution and socialist construction have greatly inspired and armed the revolutionary peoples of the world. They have expressed their determination to advance courageously towards the most beautiful communist society under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Marxist-Leninists of various countries say that Chairman Mao's theories on the contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society are the guide for all countries carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and are a powerful ideological weapon to prevent and oppose revisionism. The heroic people of Albania, who have become a great socialist beacon in Europe, have adhered to the Marxist-Leninist line, taken a series of revolutionary measures, and consolidated proletarian dictatorship. The Albanian people say: "The experience of socialist revolution and socialist construction summarized by Comrade Mao Zedong is of great significance not only to China but to the whole world." The Central Committee of the Marxist-Leninist Center of the Netherlands firmly stated in a letter to Chairman Mao: "Under your leadership, Marxist-Leninists will lead the peoples of the world to socialism and communism through the revolutionary road." In the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, where modern revisionist cliques have pushed them onto the road of capitalist restoration, revolutionary peoples place even more hope in Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. An old worker in the Soviet Union said that Mao Zedong Thought will help us carry out the second revolution. An old revolutionary in Poland said: With Comrade Mao Zedong in the world, there is hope. He firmly believes that communism will break through countless difficulties and ultimately achieve victory throughout the world.

	"In all revolutionary work, Mao Zedong Thought must be put in a prominent position!" This is the thunderous call of revolutionaries from all countries. The organ of the Chilean Revolutionary Communist Party, the newspaper *Spartacus*, pointed out in an article, "To put Mao Zedong Thought in a prominent position means to put politics in a prominent position, to put proletarian dictatorship in a prominent position, to put class struggle in a prominent position, to put the materialist dialectical worldview in a prominent position; it means to put revolutionary ideology in the forefront of the revolution; it means to put the great revolutionary ideal and revolutionary moral spirit in a prominent position."

	Today, hundreds of millions of revolutionary peoples from all over the world are resolutely saying in various languages of the world: "We must support Mao Zedong Thought, we must forever believe in Mao Zedong Thought!" "To make a revolution, we must study Mao Zedong Thought, we must master Mao Zedong Thought!" Forever raise high the "eternal torch" of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward! Let Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the world in a brilliant red light!

    走毛泽东的路，世界革命一定胜利
    “在毛泽东思想的指引下，走毛泽东的道路，大闹世界革命！”这就是五大洲革命人民的一致结论和共同决心。
    走毛泽东的路，大闹革命——这就要高举毛主席关于建党学说的光辉旗帜，建立用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的真正的无产阶级政党，作为革命的领导核心。
    在同帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，世界各国新型的马克思列宁主义政党和组织纷纷出现，并且日益壮大和巩固。它们正在努力按照毛主席的建党学说，把自己的党建设成为真正的革命党。各国马克思列宁主义者和革命人民说，毛泽东思想就是他们的“统一行动纲领”、“最高行动准则”，是他们的“方向盘”、“指南针”和“指路明灯”。澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）的领导人指出：“学习和运用毛泽东思想，是我们的工作和实践的中心”；比利时共产党、新西兰共产党、马来亚共产党和黎巴嫩社会主义革命党等兄弟党的领导人，以及哥伦比亚革命领导人都先后在决定、讲话和文章中指出，革命者都要把毛泽东思想作为革命行动的指南，作为在政治、思想、理论和组织上进行斗争的马克思列宁主义的准则。阿根廷共产主义先锋组织机关报《不妥协报》强调指出，只有用毛泽东思想教育成长的新型的马克思列宁主义战士，才能无愧于我们这个伟大时代的共产主义者的光荣称号。
    走毛泽东的路，大闹革命——这就要高举毛主席关于武装斗争、人民战争思想的光辉旗帜，用革命暴力来对付反革命暴力。
    毛主席关于“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题”的英明论断，正在武装越来越多的革命人民。在世界反美斗争焦点的越南，被誉为打“虎”英雄的越南人民在抗美救国斗争中越战越强，取得了伟大的胜利。因此，他们对毛泽东思想就感到分外亲切。越南南方一位英雄说：“毛主席的军事思想，是无产阶级和被压迫民族争取解放的最正确的理论。毛主席的人民战争思想是世界革命人民战胜敌人的法宝。”正在英勇地同最凶恶的美国狼较量的老挝人民称赞毛主席的人民战争思想，是“最伟大、最卓越的创作之一”，它“对被压迫民族的解放运动作出了非常伟大的贡献”。揭竿而起的泰国人民、正在坚持武装斗争的马来亚和菲律宾人民，都正在战争中学习和运用毛主席的军事思想。正在巩固农村根据地和加强人民军队建设的刚果（利）爱国武装力量的战士们指出，他们在反对美帝国主义及其同谋者和走狗的斗争中总结出经验，证明了毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的论点是完全正确的，这是刚果（利）人民获得解放的唯一正确道路。武装斗争的火焰也正在安哥拉、莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚、赤道几内亚、津巴布韦、喀麦隆和西南非等国家和地区燃烧。在一向被美国当作“后院”的拉丁美洲，秘鲁、委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔、洪都拉斯、危地马拉和多米尼加等国的许多革命者，也都纷纷拿起武器，带着毛主席的著作，进入高山密林，进行斗争。墨西哥一位工人指出：拉丁美洲人民必须朝着毛主席指出的方向和道路前进！各国人民说，现代修正主义者所散布的“和平过渡”的谬论已经破产。
    走毛泽东的路，大闹革命——这就要高举毛主席关于工农联盟学说的光辉旗帜，在工人阶级同农民结成巩固联盟的基础上，发展和壮大革命力量。
    世界上有越来越多的革命者认识到并正在运用革命必须依靠农民，建立农村革命根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取全国胜利的思想。老挝爱国战线党在斗争中正在实行广泛的统一战线政策，执行武装斗争、发动群众和发展生产三大任务，建立了革命根据地，革命斗争不断发展。安哥拉的爱国武装力量，正在树立建立农村根据地的思想，他们同人民群众的关系更加密切了，为夺取新的胜利准备了条件。其他一些资本主义国家的革命者也说，毛主席的论断，对他们的斗争有着深刻的指导意义，他们一定在毛泽东思想指引下走向胜利。
  走毛泽东的路，大闹革命——这就要高举毛主席关于国际统一战线的光辉旗帜，把全世界百分之九十以上的人民团结起来，结成一条最广泛、最真实的反美统一战线，打倒全世界人民的最凶恶的共同敌人美帝国主义。
    毛主席在给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中号召，“全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。”各国革命人民都在热烈响应毛主席这一伟大号召，决心团结在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，为建立一个新世界而战斗。新西兰共产党领导人指出，毛主席的贺电“深刻地体现了无产阶级国际主义和马克思列宁主义的革命精神”，它是“动员各国人民团结起来朝着唯一正确的道路胜利前进的号角”。在毛泽东思想指引下，一个新的、更加剧烈的反美革命风暴正在全世界兴起。
    走毛泽东的路，大闹革命——这就要高举毛主席关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的光辉旗帜，把革命进行到底，把人类最美好的理想变成现实。
    毛主席提出的一系列关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论大大地鼓舞和武装了全世界革命人民。他们表示决心在毛泽东思想的引导下，向人类最美好的共产主义社会奋勇迈进。
    各国马克思列宁主义者说，毛主席关于社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论，是一切进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的国家的指南，是防止修正主义和反对修正主义的强大思想武器。成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义明灯的阿尔巴尼亚的英雄的人民，坚持了马克思列宁主义的路线，采取了一系列的革命化措施，巩固了无产阶级专政。阿尔巴尼亚人民说：“由毛泽东同志所总结的中国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的经验，不仅对中国，而且对全世界都有伟大的意义。”荷兰马克思列宁主义中心中央委员会在给毛主席的信中坚定地表示：“在您的领导下的马克思列宁主义者，将引导全世界人民，通过革命道路走向社会主义和共产主义。”在被现代修正主义集团推上资本主义复辟道路的苏联和某些东欧国家里，革命人民更把希望寄托在毛主席和中国共产党身上。苏联一位老工人说，毛泽东思想将帮助我们进行第二次革命。波兰的一位老革命者说：世界上有了毛泽东同志，就充满了希望。他坚信共产主义将冲破重重困难，最终在全世界取得胜利。
    “在一切革命工作中，必须突出毛泽东思想！”这是世界各国革命者发出的震天动地的呼声。智利革命共产党机关报《斯巴达克报》在一篇文章中指出，“突出毛泽东思想就意味着突出政治，突出无产阶级专政，突出阶级斗争，突出辩证唯物主义的世界观；意味着把革命思想放在革命的首位；意味着突出伟大的革命理想和革命的道德精神。”
    今天，五洲四海的亿万革命人民，用世界上的各种不同的语言坚决地说：“必须拥护毛泽东思想，永远信仰毛泽东思想！”“干革命就必须学习毛泽东思想，精通毛泽东思想！”永远高举毛泽东思想这个“千秋万载的火炬”前进！让毛泽东思想把世界照得通红通红！
