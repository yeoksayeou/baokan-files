Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us, "You must concern yourselves with the affairs of the state and see the Cultural Revolution through to the end!" To truly shoulder the revolutionary burden that Chairman Mao has entrusted to us and to carry it through to the end, we must make our ranks thoroughly revolutionary and combat-ready. However, within our ranks, there still exist various non-proletarian thoughts that greatly hinder our ability to shoulder this burden. Therefore, it is necessary for revolutionary rebels to seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," and use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon to rectify our ranks.

Break with selfishness and establish public spirit; overcome sectarianism and individualism

In some units and schools, revolutionary rebels have formed several revolutionary rebel organizations. This situation is, to a certain extent, unavoidable. However, since the general direction is the same, it is logical to gradually strengthen unity and solidarity. However, some organizations only band together with those who share their views, fighting as lone wolves and practicing "mountainheadism." Some organizations have differing opinions internally, but instead of starting from a desire for unity, exchanging views, and achieving consensus through criticism and self-criticism, they act on impulse and easily cause splits.

Some individual leaders in certain units act as if they are the sole authority, showing no respect for brotherly combat units, thinking, "I am the best in the world." Some even fight over names and positions, insisting on signing their names to work they have not participated in, sometimes arguing red-faced over the order of signatures. Some people, after achieving a little success, boast about themselves, with their tails held high. Some people do not want to live a simple and frugal life, disregarding the interests of the state and the people, and pursuing material enjoyment.

This sectarianism and individualism "is a corrosive agent that causes disunity, lax relations, passive work, and differing opinions." If this continues, it will inevitably lead to a detachment from the masses and the failure of the revolution.

Due to the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the status of revolutionary rebels has fundamentally changed. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Modesty helps one go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind." We revolutionary rebels are the ones who have cast off the "self" and dared to rebel and fight. This is our precious quality to be proud of. We revolutionary rebels must overcome complacency, continue to wage the battle of eliminating bourgeois ideology and establishing proletarian ideology in our minds, and act from the fundamental interests of the revolution, not from the interests of individuals or small groups. Only in this way can revolutionary rebels, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve great unity and solidarity, unite all forces that can be united, and push the struggle to new heights.

Emphasize politics and strengthen ideological revolutionization

The revolutionary rebels of Shanghai, wielding the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, have rebelled against the capitalist-roaders in the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, achieving brilliant results. Our general direction has always been correct. However, many of our comrades only pay attention to the fight and neglect the ideological revolutionization of our ranks, not understanding that to achieve a thorough victory, we must further "propagandize the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses."

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in his first reception of the Red Guards: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, reform people's souls, achieve the revolutionization of people's thinking, uproot the roots of revisionism, and consolidate and develop the socialist system." We revolutionary rebels listen to Chairman Mao the most, understand the great significance of this Cultural Revolution the most, and understand the essence of criticizing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie the most. Every revolutionary rebel comrade, especially those in charge of various levels of work, should emphasize the study of Chairman Mao's works, especially organize everyone to study the "Three Articles," "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," "Against Liberalism," "Order of the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on Reissuing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention," and important documents from the Party Central Committee and editorials from the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine. The main responsible comrades must personally grasp, firmly grasp, and grasp to the end. We revolutionary rebels must emphasize politics, emphasize the revolutionization of people's thinking, and emphasize the Four Firsts and the March 8th Spirit. We must be good at using the intervals between battles to summarize experiences, conduct rectification, and make our ranks truly become a fighting team and propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought, propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, uniting the majority, and organizing a vast and mighty cultural revolutionary army that is highly proletarianized and combat-ready, to carry out the nationwide class struggle in 1967.

Strengthen democratic centralism and overcome the tendency of ultra-democracy

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in his discussion of great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat: "This great democracy is the Party fearlessly allowing the broad masses to use the forms of great debate, great criticism, big-character posters, great links, and great connections to criticize and supervise the Party and state organs at all levels and their leading personnel. At the same time, in accordance with the principles of the Paris Commune, fully realize the democratic rights of the people." We revolutionary rebels have used proletarian great democracy to achieve great success.

However, in our ranks, especially among young students, there also exists a tendency of ultra-democracy. Some people confuse the essence of proletarian great democracy and ultra-democracy. They want democracy but not centralism; they want freedom but not discipline. They do not care about the collective, coming and going as they please, with personal opinions first, not obeying collective decisions, and insisting on their own opinions after being overruled, refusing to execute collective resolutions to show "protest." Some comrades have poor organizational and disciplinary consciousness, often irresponsibly spreading rumors behind people's backs, and mistakenly believing that this is called "great democracy."

Chairman Mao has long pointed out the harmfulness of this bad tendency, "which lies in damaging and even completely destroying the Party's organization, weakening and even completely annihilating the Party's fighting capacity, making the Party unable to bear the responsibility of struggle, and thus causing the failure of the revolution." We should seriously implement Chairman Mao's advocacy of democratic centralism, overcome the bad tendency of ultra-democracy, strengthen organizational and disciplinary consciousness, fully play the great role of proletarian great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and make our ranks truly become a revolutionary force with high initiative, high self-awareness, and high organizational and disciplinary consciousness, becoming a proletarian cultural revolutionary army that can be called upon to come, come to fight, and fight to win.

Various non-proletarian thoughts ultimately stem from the "self." We revolutionary rebels not only dare to rebel against the old world but also dare to wage a revolution in the depths of our souls, breaking with selfishness and establishing public spirit, putting revolutionary interests first, and overcoming various non-proletarian tendencies in thought, organization, and politics. Chairman Mao teaches us: "As long as we persist in what is right for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our ranks will certainly prosper." In the fiery class struggle, we revolutionary rebels must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely overcome all kinds of non-proletarian thoughts, achieve the great unity and solidarity of revolutionary rebels, bravely shoulder the burden of "grasp revolution, promote production" entrusted to us by Chairman Mao, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better!

　　以毛泽东思想为武器实行革命派大联合
　　同济大学东方红兵团战上海纵队第一支队
    毛主席教导我们说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们要能真正挑起毛主席他老人家交给我们的这副革命重担，要能把担子挑到底，就必须使我们的队伍非常革命化、战斗化。可是，在我们队伍中，还存在着各种各样的非无产阶级思想，这对于挑起这副重担妨碍极大。因此，革命造反派很有必要认真学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，整顿自己的队伍。
    破私立公，克服宗派主义和个人主义
    在有些单位、有些学校，革命造反派形成了好几个革命造反组织。这种情况，在一定的时期内，也是难以完全避免的。但是，既然大方向是一致的，照理就应该逐步地加强联合，加强团结。而有的组织只是和自己意气相投的人抱成小圈圈，孤军奋战，搞“山头主义”。有的组织内部产生了不同的意见，不是从团结的愿望出发，通过交换意见，批评与自我批评，取得一致，而是意气用事，轻易地造成分裂。
    有些单位中的个别领导人，“唯我独尊”，对兄弟战斗队不尊重，“老子天下第一”。有的还争名夺利，根本没有参加的工作也要签上自己的大名，有时为了自己签名排列的先后，和人家争得面红耳赤。有的人取得了一点成绩，就自吹自擂，尾巴翘得老高。有的人不愿过艰苦朴素的生活，不顾国家人民的利益，追求物质享受。
    这种宗派主义和个人主义“是一种腐蚀剂，使团结涣散，关系松懈，工作消极，意见分歧。”这样下去，必然会脱离群众，导致革命的失败。
    由于毛主席革命路线的胜利，我们革命造反派的地位发生了根本的变化。我们要牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。我们革命造反派是丢掉了私字，才敢于造反、敢于斗争的，这是我们足以自豪的可贵品质。我们革命造反派一定要克服自满情绪，继续打好头脑中灭资兴无、破私立公的思想仗，一切要从革命的根本利益出发，而不应从个人或小集团的利益出发。只有这样，革命造反派才能在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，实行大联合、大团结，团结一切可以团结的力量，把斗争推向更新的高潮。
    突出政治，加强思想革命化
    上海的革命造反派奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，造上海市委走资本主义道路当权派的反，造资产阶级反动路线的反，取得了辉煌的成就。我们的大方向始终是正确的。但是我们有不少的同志只注意战斗，不注意自己队伍的思想革命化，不懂得要取得彻底的胜利，必须进一步“宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众”。
    林彪同志在第一次接见红卫兵小将时指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，就是要消灭资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，改造人的灵魂，实现人的思想革命化，挖掉修正主义根子，巩固和发展社会主义制度。”我们革命造反派最听毛主席的话，最能理解这次文化大革命的伟大意义，最能理解批判资产阶级反动路线的实质。我们每个革命造反派的同志，特别是担任各级领导工作的同志，更应该突出毛主席著作的学习，特别应该立即组织大家学习“老三篇”，学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《反对自由主义》《中国人民解放军总部关于重行颁布三大纪律八项注意的训令》以及党中央有关的重要文件和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志的社论。主要负责人更要亲自抓、狠狠抓、抓到底。我们革命造反派一定要大抓突出政治，大抓人的思想革命化，大抓四个第一、三八作风，要善于利用战役的空隙时间总结经验，进行整风，使我们这个队伍真正成为毛泽东思想的战斗队、宣传队，宣传群众，组织群众，团结大多数，组织起一支浩浩荡荡的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的文化革命大军，开展一九六七年的全国全面的阶级斗争。
    健全民主集中制，克服极端民主化的倾向
    林彪同志在谈到无产阶级专政下的大民主时指出：“这种大民主，就是党无所畏惧地让广大群众运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的形式，批评和监督党和国家的各级领导机关和各级领导人。同时，按照巴黎公社的原则，充分实现人民民主权利。”我们革命造反派运用无产阶级大民主，取得了很大成绩。
    但是，在我们队伍中，特别在青年学生中，也存在着一种极端民主化的错误倾向。有些人混淆了无产阶级大民主和极端民主化的实质。他们只要民主，不要集中；只要自由，不要纪律。他们对集体很不关心，要来就来，要走就走，个人意见第一，集体决定不服从，个人意见被否决后，还固执己见，拒绝执行集体的决议，以示“抗议”。有的同志组织性纪律性很差，往往不负责任地到处背后乱讲，还错误地认为这就叫“大民主”。
    毛主席早就指出了这种不良倾向的危害性，“在于损伤以至完全破坏党的组织，削弱以至完全毁灭党的战斗力，使党担负不起斗争的责任，由此造成革命的失败。”我们应该认真贯彻毛主席所提倡的民主集中制，克服极端民主化的恶劣倾向，加强组织性和纪律性，充分发挥无产阶级专政下的大民主的伟大作用，使我们这个队伍真正成为有高度自觉性、主动性和高度组织性、纪律性的革命的队伍，成为召之即来，来之能战，战之能胜的无产阶级文化革命大军。
    形形色色的非无产阶级的思想，归根到底，来源于“私”字。我们革命造反派不但敢于造旧世界的反，而且敢于在自己灵魂深处闹革命，破私立公，把革命利益放在第一位，在思想上、组织上、政治上克服各种非无产阶级的思想倾向。毛主席教导我们：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”在火热的阶级斗争中，我们革命造反派一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决克服一切形形色色的非无产阶级思想，实行革命造反派的大联合，大团结，勇敢地挑起毛主席交给我们的“抓革命，促生产”的重担，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好！
