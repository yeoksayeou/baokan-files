	The People's Interests Are the Command
	Deputy Squad Leader  Wú Hànchāo

	“All actions follow orders,” this is the principle of revolutionary soldiers. However, for the sake of the people's interests and the needs of the revolution, sometimes necessary actions must be taken even without orders. “Firelight is the command,” “Gunshots are the command,” these refer to such conscious actions.

	Once, a warehouse thirty miles away from our unit's base caught fire. The entire company quickly assembled and rushed to the scene to rescue. That day, new soldiers Pú Zhōulóng and Wáng Hóngmǎ were sending family members to the train station, and by the time they returned to the company, it was already late. The cook, Chén Jiéshí, and Deputy Commander Zhào Fúquán explained the situation to them. Without even eating, the two quickly ran towards the firelight.

	Chairman Mao said: “What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we need to go there. This is what a good comrade does.” Chairman Mao's words are the highest command, Chairman Mao's words are the principle of all actions. This is what Pú Zhōulóng and Wáng Hóngmǎ thought and did.

	As they ran, they encouraged each other with Chairman Mao's words: “Develop the spirit of bravery in battle, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous combat (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest).” They ran until they were out of breath and covered in sweat, covering a distance of twenty miles. Just then, a passing truck gave them a ride to the scene where the fire was raging.

	At the summary meeting for the firefighting efforts, Pú Zhōulóng and Wáng Hóngmǎ's actions were praised by their superiors. From this incident, I realized: all actions follow orders, fundamentally speaking, it is to take the interests of the broad masses of the people as the starting point; whatever is in the interests of the people, with or without orders, must be executed. Dǒng Cúnruì sacrificed himself to blow up the enemy's fort, Huáng Jìguāng sacrificed himself to block the gun port, Qiū Shǎocūn remained steadfast despite being burned by flames, Wáng Jié bravely rushed towards the explosives to save people's lives. At that time, although there were no orders from superiors, they were all models of consciously executing orders and discipline.

### 人民群众的利益就是命令

    人民群众的利益就是命令
    副班长  吴汉超
    “一切行动听指挥”，这是革命军人行动的准则。但是为了人民的利益和革命需要，有时没有命令也要采取必要的行动。“火光就是命令”，“枪声就是命令”，就是说的这种自觉行动。
    有一次，离我们部队驻地三十里外的一个仓库着了火，全连紧急集合赶去抢救。这天，新战士蒲周龙和王洪马送家属去火车站，回到连队天已经晚了。留营的炊事员陈结实和副连长赵福全向他们说明情况后，两个人连饭也顾不得吃，就飞快地朝火光方向奔去。
  毛主席说过：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”毛主席的话就是最高命令，毛主席的话就是一切行动的准则，蒲周龙和王洪马是这样想的，也是这样去做的。
    他们两人一边飞跑，一边用毛主席的话互相鼓励：“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风。”跑得气喘吁吁，汗流浃背，一直跑了二十里路，刚好有一辆顺路汽车，把他们捎到了火光冲天的现场。
    在救火的总结大会上，蒲周龙和王洪马的行动受到了上级的表扬。从这件事里，使我认识到：一切行动听指挥，从根本上来说，就是以广大人民的利益为出发点；凡是符合人民的利益的，有命令要执行，没有命令也要执行。董存瑞舍身炸敌堡，黄继光舍身堵枪眼，邱少云烈火烧身不动摇，王杰为了抢救人民的生命奋勇扑向炸药。当时虽然没有上级的命令，但是他们都是自觉执行命令、执行纪律的模范。
