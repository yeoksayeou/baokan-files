		Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line!

		Shanghai Art Front Mao Zedong Thought Revolutionary Rebel Corps

		Comrades!

		The great proletarian cultural revolution is developing in depth. The bourgeois reactionary line represented by China's Khrushchev, Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, and their agents in the art world has been thoroughly exposed and severely criticized. The revolutionary masses in the art world have risen up and are fighting bravely. The enemy, however, is not reconciled to its defeat. It is making a new counterattack. It is trying to reverse the verdict by using the method of "reversing the black and white" and "reversing the right and wrong." It is trying to turn the revolutionary masses into counter-revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries into revolutionaries. It is trying to turn the revolutionary masses into counter-revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries into revolutionaries. It is trying to turn the revolutionary masses into counter-revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries into revolutionaries. It is trying to turn the revolutionary masses into counter-revolutionaries and the counter-revolutionaries into revolutionaries.

		The revolutionary masses in the art world must be vigilant and resolute. They must not be deceived by the enemy's tricks. They must not be intimidated by the enemy's threats. They must not be confused by the enemy's propaganda. They must not be divided by the enemy's plots. They must unite more closely and fight more bravely. They must thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. They must defend the great proletarian cultural revolution to the end. They must defend the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought to the end. They must defend the great communist party of China to the end. They must defend the great socialist motherland to the end.

		Comrades!
