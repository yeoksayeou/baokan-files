Dear Red Guards and revolutionary youngsters!

Doing good for the people is a glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Chairman Mao says: "Our army is a people's army. It belongs to the people. It fights for the people's interests and is subject to the people's supervision." The Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the People's Liberation Army are the sons and daughters of the people. They firmly remember the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, serving the people wholeheartedly. They always and everywhere do good for the people. The phrase "Devote your heart to the people" expresses the boundless loyalty of all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army to the people.

In the past difficult years of war, the Red Army, the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the People's Liberation Army, regardless of how tired they were from marching and fighting, would always help the local people fetch water and sweep the courtyard when they arrived at a place, and assist the masses in solving various difficulties. They treated the people as their parents, brothers, and sisters. The people also treated them as family. A close relationship like fish and water was established between the military and the people.

After victory, the People's Liberation Army continued to maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of serving and loving the people. They are not only a combat force but also a work force and a production force; they are not only the defenders of socialist causes but also the builders of socialist causes. For example, they do mass work, support spring plowing and summer harvest, support the three autumns, build water conservancy projects, rescue and relieve disasters, treat diseases, and so on. In short, wherever there is a need, they go there; wherever there is difficulty, they appear there. They have made brilliant contributions to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland. As early as the initial period of liberation, in the border areas of Yunnan, after completing the task of suppressing bandits, the deputy platoon leader Wang Kerong of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and two soldiers came to Heiniantang, which is only a few miles away from the border. The local Lisu people, due to being deceived and propagandized by the Kuomintang and reactionary heads, did not dare to approach when they first saw the People's Liberation Army. Class enemies also took the opportunity to carry out various sabotage activities. Wang Kerong and the other two were far from their leaders, facing unfamiliar environments, harsh living conditions, and complex struggles. What should they do? They studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Our comrades must be prepared to face difficulties and setbacks, to see achievements and light, and to raise our courage. The Chinese people are suffering, and we have the responsibility to save them. We must strive for it." Chairman Mao's words pointed out the direction, boosted everyone's confidence, and encouraged everyone's courage. They decided to serve the people wholeheartedly like Zhang Side, and extensively carried out activities to do good for the people. From then on, regardless of day or night, wind or rain, they endured fatigue and hardship, and went from house to house, carrying firewood, fetching water, working in the fields, treating diseases... doing whatever they saw. They also visited the poor and asked about their hardships, and whenever they had the chance, they propagated the party's policies, telling the people: "We are people sent by Chairman Mao, serving the poor Lisu people." Gradually, the doubts on the people's faces disappeared, and smiles appeared. The soldiers' model actions moved the Lisu people. They listened to the party and Chairman Mao, and with the help of the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, truly embarked on the road to liberation.

In recent years, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Liberation Army has produced many great communist warriors like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Xie Chen, Ouyang Hai, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang. They do not seek fame or wealth, do not fear hardship or death, and devote themselves wholeheartedly to the revolution and the people. For the sake of the people's interests and to protect the people's lives and property, they dare to climb mountains of knives and leap into seas of fire. Their glorious names and heroic deeds will forever live in the hearts of millions of people in the motherland. Now, throughout the army, there are more and more soldiers like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Cai Yongxiang, and the activities of doing good for the people are more extensively carried out. This is a vivid manifestation of the great flourishing of the communist spirit among the broad cadres and soldiers nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Dear revolutionary youngsters, learn from the People's Liberation Army, and definitely pass on and carry forward the glorious tradition of the People's Liberation Army of doing good for the people everywhere. Wherever you go, do good there.

To do good for the people, you must first have a strong mass perspective and deep proletarian feelings. This requires a good study of Chairman Mao's works, learning from Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice of trusting and loving the masses without limit, serving the people wholeheartedly, and diligently being the people's servant. You should often use Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people and the standard of "completely" and "thoroughly" to examine yourself, always thinking of the people and caring for the people, thinking what the people think, worrying about what the people worry about, and helping what the people need. The People's Liberation Army has produced so many model units and heroes who love the people because they have diligently studied Chairman Mao's works, established the worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly, and are the result of being nurtured by the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Helping the people do good things, you must pay attention to implementing the class line, strictly distinguish between the people and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and insist on doing good for the poor and lower-middle peasants and other basic masses. Every time you arrive at a place, you must first understand the social situation and class division situation. A soldier of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Pu Shengtang, while propagating Mao Zedong Thought in Shandong Province's Xingtai Region's Shuimen Brigade, learned that seven miles away on a high mountain lived an old man who had been a shepherd for landlords for forty years and had his right arm broken by a landlord. To enable this old man to watch a movie with scenes of Chairman Mao, Pu Shengtang, with deep class feelings, carried him down from the mountain, and after watching the movie, carried him back up. The old man said gratefully: "The children educated by Chairman Mao are beyond words, treating us poor and lower-middle peasants so highly!"

Helping the people do good things, you must not only help individual families but also help people's communes and production teams. As long as it does not affect combat missions, as long as it is beneficial to the people, beneficial to the state and the collective, you must do it. Not only should you help the people fetch water, sweep the courtyard, chop firewood, husk rice, treat diseases, and cut hair, but you should also actively participate in the collective production labor of the commune. In busy farming seasons, help the people harvest and plow. When the people encounter natural disasters, you must vigorously help the people fight droughts and floods, build water conservancy projects, and overcome various natural disasters.

### 为人民群众做好事

专栏：谈谈解放军的连队行军政治工作

    为人民群众做好事
    亲爱的红卫兵战士们，亲爱的革命小将们！为人民做好事，这是中国人民解放军的光荣传统。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”红军、八路军、新四军、人民解放军，是人民的子弟兵，是人民的儿子。他们牢牢记着伟大领袖毛主席的教导，全心全意为人民服务，时时处处为人民群众做好事。“掏尽红心为人民”，这句话，表达了人民解放军全体指战员对人民的无限忠心。
    过去艰苦的战争年月，红军、八路军、新四军、人民解放军不管行军、打仗怎样疲劳，每到一个地方，都争着替乡亲们挑水、扫院子，帮助群众解决各种困难。他们把人民群众当做自己的父母、兄弟和姐妹。人民群众也把他们当做一家人。军民之间，建立了亲密的鱼水关系。
    胜利以后，人民解放军继续保持和发扬了为人民、爱人民的光荣传统。他们既是战斗队，又是工作队和生产队；既是社会主义事业的保卫者，又是社会主义事业的建设者。例如，做群众工作，支援春耕、夏收，支援三秋，兴修水利，抢险救灾，治疗疾病，等等。总之，哪里需要，他们就到哪里去；哪里困难，他们就出现在哪里。他们为祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业作出了光辉的贡献。还在解放初期，云南边疆地区，刚刚完成剿匪任务，解放军某部副排长王克荣和两个战士，就来到离国境线只有几华里的黑泥塘。当地的傈僳族人民，由于受到国民党和反动头人的欺骗宣传，开始看到解放军时，都不敢接近。阶级敌人也乘机进行各种各样的破坏活动。王克荣等三人远离领导，面对着陌生的环境，艰苦的生活，复杂的斗争，怎么办？他们就学习《为人民服务》：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。中国人民正在受难，我们有责任解救他们，我们要努力奋斗。”毛主席的话，指明了方向，提高了大家的信心，鼓起了大家的勇气。他们决心像张思德那样全心全意为人民服务，广泛开展了为群众做好事的活动。从此，他们不管白天黑夜，刮风下雨，都忍着疲劳，耐着饥寒，这家进，那家出，扛柴、挑水、下田、看病……见到什么就做什么。他们还访贫问苦，有机会就宣传党的政策，告诉群众：“我们是毛主席派来的人，是为傈僳族穷苦人服务的。”渐渐地群众脸上的疑虑消逝了，露出了笑容，战士们的模范行动，感动了傈僳族人民。他们听党和毛主席的话，在解放军同志帮助下，真正走上了翻身解放的道路。
    这些年来，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，解放军部队里，涌现了许许多多像雷锋、王杰、谢臣、欧阳海、刘英俊、蔡永祥等伟大的共产主义战士。他们不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，一心为人民。为了人民的利益，为了保护人民生命财产的安全，他们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。他们光辉的名字，他们的英雄事迹，永远活在千千万万祖国人民的心里。现在，全军像雷锋式的、王杰式的、蔡永祥式的战士越来越多，为人民群众做好事的活动，更广泛的开展起来。这是在毛泽东思想的哺育下，广大干部战士共产主义精神大发扬的生动表现。亲爱的革命小将们，学习解放军，就一定要把解放军处处为人民群众做好事的这一光荣传统，接过来，传下去，走到哪里，就把好事做到哪里。
    要为人民群众做好事，首先要有坚强的群众观点，要有深厚的无产阶级感情。这就要很好地学习毛主席著作，学习毛主席无限信任群众，无限热爱群众的伟大革命实践，全心全意为人民服务，勤勤恳恳做人民的勤务员。要经常用毛主席为人民服务的教导，用“完全”、“彻底”的尺子来对照检查自己，时时想到人民，处处关心人民，想人民所想，急人民所急，帮人民所需。解放军所以涌现出许许多多爱民模范单位和英雄模范人物，就是因为他们刻苦学习毛主席著作，树立了全心全意为人民服务的世界观的结果，是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果。
    帮助群众做好事，要注意贯彻阶级路线，要严格划清人民群众与地、富、反、坏分子的界限，坚持为贫下中农等基本群众做好事。每到一地首先要弄清社会情况和阶级划分情况。解放军某部战士卜生堂，在邢台地区水门大队开展宣传毛泽东思想活动时，了解到七里开外的高山上，住着一位给地主放过四十年羊、被地主打断右臂的残废老人。为了使这位老人能够看上有毛主席镜头的电影，卜生堂怀着深厚的阶级感情，把他从山上背下来，看完电影又背回去。这位老人无限感激地说：“毛主席教导出来的孩子没法说，把俺贫下中农看得真高贵呀！”
    帮助群众做好事，不仅要帮助一家一户，更要帮助人民公社和生产队做好事。在不影响战斗任务的情况下，只要对人民有利的事，只要对国家、对集体有利的事都要去做。不仅要帮助群众挑水、扫院、打柴、舂米、治病、理发等，更要积极参加公社集体生产劳动，在农忙季节，帮助群众收割和耕种。当群众遇到自然灾害时，更要大力帮助群众抗旱排涝，兴修水利，战胜各种自然灾害。
