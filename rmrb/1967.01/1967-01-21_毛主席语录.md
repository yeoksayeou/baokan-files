The current surge in the peasant movement is a tremendous issue. Within a very short period, tens of millions of peasants from the central, southern, and northern provinces of China will rise up. Their momentum will be like a sudden storm, swift and fierce, and no force, no matter how great, will be able to suppress it. They will break through all the nets that bind them and rush swiftly forward on the road to liberation.
