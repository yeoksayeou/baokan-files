A bag of sorghum

Soldier Kang Jingyan

The demobilized soldiers who returned to their unit to visit the Red Ninth Company were about to leave. The leaders and comrades at all levels were truly reluctant to part. The military sent each person a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"; the brigade sent each person a set of green military uniforms; the regiment presented the Red Ninth Platoon of the Great Northern Wilderness with a red banner inscribed with "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and March Forward Bravely"; what gift should the company give to express the sentiments of all comrades?

For this purpose, the Red Ninth Company even held a special party branch committee meeting to discuss the matter. The meeting was very lively. Comrades, based on the different situations of the demobilized old soldiers, prepared to send different gifts. When it came to the demobilized comrades in the Great Northern Wilderness, the original political instructor of the Red Ninth Company, Comrade Wang Yinzhe, suggested sending a bag of sorghum. This proposal struck a chord with the comrades, and everyone unanimously agreed.

A few days ago, Comrade Yin Dianchen, representing the demobilized old soldiers to the Great Northern Wilderness, reported to everyone about their work situation. Comrades were deeply moved. When they demobilized to the Great Northern Wilderness, the first meal they ate was porridge made from the sorghum they brought with them. After eating this revolutionary meal, they settled down in a few dilapidated houses in the vast, snowy wilderness.

A great battle to wrest grain from the wilderness began! Comrades, with a mouthful of frozen rations and a mouthful of snow, braved wind and rain, endured frost and snow, endured countless hardships, and reclaimed acre after acre of wasteland; their hands were blistered, and their feet were frostbitten. But how could difficulties and hardships frighten these revolutionary heroes! In such a harsh environment, it was Chairman Mao's books that gave them increased confidence and courage. Comrades unanimously agreed: to take root in the Great Northern Wilderness, they must first let Mao Zedong Thought take root in their minds! With four volumes of precious books in their bosoms, they vowed: "The blue sky is our blanket, the white snow is our bed, even a typhoon of twelve levels cannot shake our resolve to transform the border!"

From spring to autumn, they fought for half a year, not only tempering themselves to be even stronger, but also inspiring the masses. Everyone praised: "The soldiers from the Red Ninth Company are truly outstanding!"

In the midst of hard work and struggle, they achieved their first bumper harvest! But this was only the first step in building the border, and they must never forget the past hard struggles!

"Yes, send sorghum!" People once again expressed: this is a simple yet precious gift. The red grains are a symbol of revolution, and the company calls it "revolutionary rice." Our friendship has been forged over the past few years, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works together, eating from the same pot of sorghum, sleeping on the same bed, and training on the same field. Although we are now separated, our revolutionary hearts are forever connected; the revolutionary tradition of hard struggle on Jinggangshan, and the revolutionary spirit of the Red Ninth Company studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, maintaining vigorous enthusiasm and fighting spirit, must be carried on forever!

The next morning, Comrade Tao Jiantian, the cook, brought a bag of sorghum, and Political Instructor Qiao Yunxi entrusted Yin Dianchen to deliver it to all the demobilized old soldiers of the Red Ninth Platoon in the Great Northern Wilderness.

Yin Dianchen held the bag with both hands, and countless unforgettable memories surged into his heart:

He remembered that on the first day of enlistment, it was the old political instructor, Comrade Chen Jinyuan, who gave him the first lesson—"In the Service of the People"; on the 800-mile march, it was the platoon leader who, side by side, read Chairman Mao's teachings, "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and strode forward, climbing the highest peaks; in the scorching sun and snowstorms, it was the comrades who carried the quotation board of Chairman Mao, teaching him how to shoot, throw grenades, and bayonet charge, forging a set of formidable combat skills; on Sunday rest days, it was the comrades who, with needle and thread, helped him mend clothes and sew quilts; in short, over the years, it was Mao Zedong Thought that nurtured him!

"Red Ninth Company established on Jinggangshan, you are forever our mother! No matter how far we travel, Mao Zedong Thought will forever be in our hearts!" Yin Dianchen felt that the red sorghum grains in his hands were like sparks of revolution, inspiring and encouraging him!

Each grain of sorghum carries the firm and thorough revolutionary spirit of the Red Ninth Company; each grain of sorghum is a red seed, to be scattered across the borders of the motherland, growing and thriving in the wind and rain, and the brilliant red flowers and fruits will bloom across the five lakes and four seas!

    一袋高粱米
    战士　康敬炎
    回部队探望的复员战士快要离开红九连了，各级首长和同志们真是依依不舍。军里送给每人一套《毛泽东选集》；师里送给每人一套绿色军装；团里送给北大荒红九班一面写有“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进”的鲜红锦旗；连里送些啥礼物，才能表达全体同志的心意呢？
    为此，九连还开了个党支部委员会专门研究。会开得非常热烈。同志们根据复员老战士们的不同情况，准备送不同的礼品。当研究到北大荒的复员战友们时，红九连原指导员王银泽同志提出送袋高粱米。这个建议说到了同志们的心坎上，大家一致赞成。
    前几天，尹殿臣同志代表复员到北大荒的老战士们，向大家汇报了他们的工作情况。同志们听了非常感动。他们复员到北大荒时，吃的头一顿饭，就是用自己带去的高粱米煮成的稀粥。他们吃了这顿革命饭，在白雪茫茫的荒原上的几间破房子里住了下来。
    一场向荒原要粮的大会战就这样开始了！同志们一口冻干粮，一口雪，迎风雨，冒寒霜，历尽千辛万苦，开出一亩亩荒田；手上打起了血泡，脚也冻肿了。但是，艰难险阻怎能吓倒革命的英雄汉！在艰苦的环境中，是毛主席的书使他们增强了信心和勇气。同志们一致认定：要在北大荒扎根，首先要让毛泽东思想在自己的头脑中扎根！他们怀揣四卷宝书，口吐豪言壮语：“蓝天当被，白雪当床，十二级的台风也刮不动我们改造边疆的志向！”
    从春到秋，他们奋战了大半年，不但自己锻炼得更加坚强了，也带动了群众，大家都夸：“红九连出来的战士真是好样的！”
    在艰苦奋斗中，他们夺得了第一个丰收！但这不过是建设边疆的第一步，万万不能忘记过去的艰苦斗争！
    “对，送高粱米！”人们再次表示：这是平凡而又珍贵的礼物。红色的米粒是革命的象征，连队里都叫它“革命米”。我们的友谊就是在过去几年中，一同活学活用毛主席著作，同吃一锅高粱米，同睡一张床，同在一个操场训练凝成的。如今我们虽然分离了，但革命的红心是永远相连的；井冈山艰苦奋斗的革命传统，红九连活学活用毛主席著作，从而保持旺盛干劲和斗志的革命精神，要永远地发扬！
    第二天早上，炊事班长陶建田同志送来了一布袋高粱米，指导员乔云岐同志委托尹殿臣，转送给在北大荒的红九班全体复员老战士。
    尹殿臣双手捧着布袋，多少难以忘怀的往事涌上了心头：
    记得入伍第一天，是老指导员陈金元同志给自己上的第一课——《为人民服务》；在八百里行军路上，是连长和自己并肩读着毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，昂首阔步，登上了最高的山峰；在烈日风雪中，是同志们扛着毛主席语录板，把着手教会了自己射击，投弹，拚刺杀，练就了一身过硬的杀敌本领；星期天假日里，是同志们一针一线帮着自己补衣服，缝被子；……一句话，几年的时间里，是毛泽东思想把自己哺育长大！
    “井冈山创建的红九连呀，您永远是我们的母亲！走遍天涯海角，毛泽东思想也永远在我们的心中！”尹殿臣觉得手中那红灿灿的高粱米粒，颗颗都是红色的火种，在鼓舞着自己，激励着自己！
    一颗颗高粱米，带去红九连坚定、彻底的革命精神；一颗颗高粱米，就是一颗颗红色种子，将要撒遍祖国的边疆，在风雨中成长壮大，那鲜艳的红花硕果将开遍五湖四海！
