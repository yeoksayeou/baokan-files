Once, the Chinese embassy in Switzerland held a reception. On a long table, many of Chairman Mao's works and other Chinese publications were placed. Guests continuously streamed over to take Chairman Mao's works. Due to the crowd, they voluntarily formed a line, taking turns to select their books. In an instant, several hundred copies of Chairman Mao's works were all taken. Some foreign friends who did not get their desired copies of Chairman Mao's works felt very regretful and left their addresses with the embassy, requesting that copies be sent to them later.

There was an elderly lady from Lausanne who took twenty copies of Chairman Mao's works by herself. She told our embassy staff, "Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts cannot be understood by me alone. I have many friends, and I also want them to know."

    让别人也读到毛主席著作
    有一次，我国驻瑞士大使馆举行招待会，在一张长桌子上放了许多毛主席的著作和其他中国书刊。客人们川流不息地到那里去取毛主席的著作。由于拥挤，他们自动排起队来，挨着次序挑选。一下子几百册毛主席著作都被拿光了。有些外国朋友没有拿到心爱的毛主席著作，感到很遗憾，给使馆留下了地址，要求以后给他们寄去。
    有一位洛桑的老太太，一个人拿了二十本毛主席著作。她对我使馆的同志说：“毛泽东主席的思想，不能只让我自己懂得。我有许多朋友，我也要让他们知道。”
