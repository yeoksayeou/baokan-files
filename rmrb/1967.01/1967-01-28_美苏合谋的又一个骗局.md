The so-called "Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies," which was manipulated by the US and the Soviet Union to be passed by the United Nations General Assembly, was formally signed on January 27 in Washington, London, and Moscow. This is another step in the global collusion between the US and the Soviet Union. These two scoundrels, who have been colluding on Earth, have now extended their "cooperation" to the skies, indeed a hot collaboration!

The signing of this treaty coincides with the moment when the US and the Soviet Union are pushing the "peace talks" plot in Vietnam. This is certainly not a coincidence. Originally, in July of last year, the Soviet representative at the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space said: "As long as the United States wages aggression against Vietnam, the United States has no right to talk about peace in outer space." However, in the blink of an eye, the Soviet revisionist leadership slapped itself in the face and hurriedly signed the so-called "peaceful use of outer space" treaty. Obviously, the Soviet revisionist leadership did this to create an atmosphere of "Sino-American cooperation" in order to facilitate a dirty political deal with American imperialism on the Vietnam issue. This once again exposes the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's false support and true betrayal of the Vietnamese people.

American imperialism has been frantically expanding its military and preparing for war, engaging in nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats, establishing military bases everywhere, and pursuing policies of aggression and war. However, the Soviet revisionist leadership has signed such a treaty with American imperialism and boasts that this treaty is a "victory for peace-loving countries over those who want to use space for military purposes," attempting to create the illusion that American imperialism is very concerned about peace and loves peace. This is the greatest deception of the people of the world.

In fact, American imperialism has been using outer space to serve its aggressive policies. Its spy satellites are tasked with detecting military intelligence from other countries. However, the treaty does not impose any restrictions on such evil deeds. Therefore, the treaty itself exposes the "peace" fraud of the US and the Soviet Union.

According to the provisions of this treaty, under the cover of so-called "international cooperation," the Soviet Union agrees to hand over its information on outer space activities to American imperialism. This is a barefaced betrayal of the interests of the Soviet people and the people of the world.

Living facts have repeatedly proven that the Soviet revisionists are a bunch of incorrigible traitors. They are firmly aligned with the world's number one enemy, American imperialism. As long as the Soviet revisionists exist, they will engage in betrayal and do evil every day. Like all reactionaries, they will never lay down their butcher's knife and become Buddhas overnight.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful."

To fight imperialism, to make revolution, and to strive for the liberation of all the people of the world, we must oppose revisionism. Towards these Soviet revisionist traitors, we can only adopt one policy: smash them! Smash them! Smash them! Smash them to smithereens!

　　美苏合谋的又一个骗局
　　本报评论员
    美苏操纵联合国大会通过的所谓“和平利用外层空间条约”，已于一月二十七日分别在华盛顿、伦敦和莫斯科正式签署。这是美苏全球大勾结的又一个步骤。这两个坏家伙，从地上的勾结发展到了天上的“合作”，真是打得火热啊！
    这个条约的签订，正好是在美苏大搞越南“和谈”阴谋的时刻，这绝不是什么巧合。本来，去年七月，苏联代表在联合国外层空间委员会上曾经说过：只要美国对越南进行侵略战争，“美国就无权谈论外层空间的和平”。可是，曾几何时，苏修就自己打自己的嘴巴，匆匆忙忙地在所谓“和平利用外层空间”的条约上签字画押。很显然，苏联修正主义领导集团这样做，是为了制造一种“苏美合作”的气氛，以便于同美帝国主义在越南问题上达成肮脏的政治交易。这再一次暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团对越南人民假支持、真出卖的丑恶面目。
    美帝国主义一直疯狂地扩军备战，进行核讹诈和核威胁，到处建立军事基地，推行侵略政策和战争政策。但是，苏联修正主义领导集团却同美帝国主义签订了这样一个条约，并且大肆吹嘘这个条约是什么“热爱和平国家对那些要把空间用于军事目的的国家的一个胜利”，企图造成一种假象，仿佛美帝国主义是十分关心和平、爱好和平的。这是对全世界人民最大的欺骗。
    事实上，美帝国主义一直就利用外层空间来为它的侵略政策服务。它的间谍卫星就是执行着探测其他国家军事情报的任务。然而，条约对这种罪恶的勾当并未加限制。因此，这个条约本身就戳穿了苏美的“和平”骗局。
    根据这个条约的规定，在所谓“国际合作”的掩盖下，苏联同意把它关于外层空间活动的情报，双手奉送给美帝国主义。这是对苏联人民利益和世界人民利益的赤裸裸的叛卖。
    活生生的事实一再证明，苏修是一伙不可救药的叛徒，他们跟世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义，是跟定了的。只要苏修存在一天，他们就要干一天叛卖的勾当，做一天坏事。他们和一切反动派一样，是绝不会放下屠刀，立地成佛的。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”
    要反帝，要革命，要争取全世界人民的解放，就必须反对修正主义。对于苏修这一小撮叛徒，只能采取一种方针，那就是：打倒！打倒！打倒！把他们打个稀巴烂！
