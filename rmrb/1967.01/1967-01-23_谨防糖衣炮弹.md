Beware the sugar-coated cannonballs

See him excitedly patting himself on the back, boasting about his eighteen skills. When physical force doesn't work, he tries persuasion. When brute force fails, he resorts to soft tactics. He plays a new trick: increasing wages and benefits, using material incentives, promoting economism! Sugar-coated cannonballs fly everywhere, honeyed words hide a dagger! He thinks he's clever, but little does he know he's wasting his efforts. It's like an ant trying to shake a tree, or a fly banging into a wall! Revolutionary people have sharp eyes, they see through his tricks, everyone raises their iron fists, striking back fiercely. Completely smash the capitalist roaders' counter-revolutionary line, vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!
