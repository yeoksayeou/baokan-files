Chairman Mao has given us the greatest inspiration. The decision by our reddest-reddest-red sun, Chairman Mao, to broadcast the telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to various revolutionary rebel groups in Shanghai has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line. We are filled with boundless excitement and enthusiastically hail Chairman Mao, long live! Long live! Ten thousand years live! Chairman Mao's support for us revolutionary rebels is the greatest inspiration and the greatest motivation! Chairman Mao always points out the direction for us at the most critical moments of the revolution. Having such a wise and great leader as Chairman Mao to steer us is a tremendous blessing! Chairman Mao, we swear to you: We will resolutely follow your instructions, defend to the death the proletarian revolutionary line you represent, firmly oppose economism, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line! We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Neither the Chinese reactionaries nor the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China will withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord." The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within our factory and those stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line, at the beginning of the movement, used "focus on production" as a pretext to suppress and attack the revolutionary rebels. Now they have launched the revisionist "sugar-coated bullets" of counter-revolution, attempting to divert a serious political struggle into the path of economism and change the direction of the struggle. They indiscriminately distribute labor protection supplies and squander national property; they use material benefits as bait to buy people's hearts. But their calculations are wrong. We revolutionary rebels, with the entire proletarian revolutionary cause in our hearts, would never be blinded by these minor favors! We have exposed their plots and given them a resolute and powerful rebuff! We have repulsed their arrogant counterattack!

The Shanghai revolutionary rebels have set us an example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. We must learn from them, study and apply Chairman Mao's works even better, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must resolutely carry out the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" proposed and repeatedly emphasized by Chairman Mao. While focusing on the revolution, we must firmly hold our production posts and complete and overfulfill production tasks with high quality. At the same time, we must continuously strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the revolutionary rebel forces, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and achieve the extremely proletarian and extremely combatant nature of the revolutionary rebels! We will thoroughly uproot the roots of counter-revolutionary revisionism and ensure that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advances victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

    毛主席给了我们最大的鼓舞
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席亲自决定向全国广播中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海各革命造反团体的贺电，大长了我们无产阶级革命造反派的志气，大灭了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的威风。我们怀着无比兴奋的心情，热烈欢呼毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！毛主席这样支持我们革命造反派，是对我们最大的鼓舞，也是最大的鞭策！毛主席总是在革命最关键时刻给我们指明方向，我们有了这样英明伟大的领袖给我们掌舵，真是天大的幸福！毛主席，我们向您老人家宣誓：我们决心听您老人家的话，誓死捍卫您老人家为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决反对经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”我们厂的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，在运动初期，以“抓生产”为名，打击和压制革命造反派，现在又抛出了反革命修正主义的“糖衣炮弹”，妄图把一场严肃的政治斗争引入经济主义的歧途，企图转移斗争的大方向。他们滥发劳动保护用品，任意挥霍浪费国家财产；他们以物质利益作为诱饵，用额外的福利收买人心。但是，他们的算盘打错了。我们革命造反派胸怀整个无产阶级革命事业，岂能被这些小恩小惠迷住了眼睛！我们及时戳穿了他们的阴谋诡计，给了他们坚决有力的回击！打退了他们的猖狂反扑！
    上海革命造反派给我们树立了活学活用毛主席著作的榜样。我们要向他们学习，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席亲自提出并一再强调的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。在抓好革命的同时，坚守生产岗位，高质量地完成和超额完成生产任务。同时，不断加强革命造反派队伍的思想建设和组织建设，破私立公，实现革命造反派的非常无产阶级化和非常战斗化！彻底挖掉反革命修正主义的根子，保证无产阶级文化大革命沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进！
