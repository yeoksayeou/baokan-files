The proletarian revolutionary spirit tightly unites the hearts of the Chinese and Albanian peoples. Shanghai revolutionary rebels write to Albanian workers to express their gratitude for their support and encouragement.

XINHUA, SHANGHAI, January 21 — The January 20 issue of the *Liberation Daily* published two letters from Shanghai revolutionary rebel workers to Albanian workers, expressing their gratitude for the great support and enthusiastic encouragement given to the Shanghai revolutionary rebels. The full texts of the two letters are as follows:

To the Workers of the Stalin Textile Combine in Tirana,

Dear Comrades and Fellow Fighters:

At a time when we are achieving decisive victories in the struggle against the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, we received your warm and enthusiastic letter from our close comrades-in-arms who stand bravely on the front lines of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism. We feel deeply moved and excited. Your letter is a great encouragement and support to us. We, the entire Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Command and all revolutionary masses of the Shanghai No. 31 Cotton Spinning and Dyeing Factory Red Flag Combat Team, salute you with the highest proletarian cultural revolution salute!

Under the correct leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the beloved leader and teacher, and the glorious Albanian Party of Labor, you have firmly held high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism amidst the encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism. With "one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun," you resolutely oppose the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism and engage in a head-on struggle against modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership. You have shown great heroism and revolutionary spirit. Truly, "Surrounded by a million enemies, we stand unshakable." Let imperialism, modern revisionism, and their running dogs tremble before you!

Our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao, is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Under his personal initiation and brilliant leadership, our country is currently undergoing a great proletarian cultural revolution. This is an unprecedented revolution that touches the souls of people, a profound political struggle to thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism in our country. We, the revolutionary rebels of our factory, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call: "You must care about state affairs and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!" In this struggle, we study and apply Chairman Mao's works, fearing neither heaven nor earth, nor ghosts nor gods, daring to "suffer a thousand cuts and pull the emperor from his throne." We rise up to smash capitalism and revisionism. But a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, along with a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, see their old tricks exposed and their thrones crumbling. Thus, they resort to conspiracies, backstabbing, and economic opportunism, attempting to lead the serious political struggle astray and change the direction of the struggle, aiming to sabotage the great proletarian cultural revolution and production. But this is utterly impossible. We are revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. We promptly expose their tricks and firmly resist their bribes of money and material, thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, every revolutionary rebel fighter among us firmly grasps the Sixteen Points, seizes the revolution, and promotes production. Our factory's annual production plan for 1966 was completed ahead of schedule in terms of both quality and quantity, the annual profit plan was completed at 104.25%, and costs were reduced by 1.76%. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until you are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic. This is a Marxist law." The facts have proven, in a most convincing way, the correctness of the brilliant judgment of our most beloved and great leader.

"The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will?" Although we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the proletarian revolutionary spirit unites our hearts. Our fighting friendship is everlasting. Dear comrades and fellow fighters! Let us always stand shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, fight together, and win together. Let us resolutely carry the magnificent cause of communism to the end and resolutely support the revolutionary peoples of the world in carrying the world revolution to the end, striving forward to build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without exploitation!

Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the great Albanian Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live, ten thousand times long live, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao!

To the Workers of the Enver Hoxha Machine Factory,

Dear Workers of the Enver Hoxha Machine Factory:

Greetings!

We are deeply grateful to you! Your letter has given us the strongest support and greatest encouragement. Dear comrades, although we are separated by thousands of miles, our hearts beat as one.

The Albanian Party of Labor, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a glorious, great, and Marxist-Leninist party. The Albanian people are heroic. The fearless revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people shines brightly, serving as a great socialist beacon in Europe. The heroic Albanian people are always a shining example for proletarian revolutionaries. We will strive to learn from your revolutionary spirit and pay our respects to you!

Currently, our great proletarian cultural revolution in China is advancing victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, along with the ghosts and monsters in society, have been surrounded by the broad revolutionary masses. However, as you mentioned in your letter, "A leopard cannot change its spots," they are unwilling to admit defeat. After failing in their attempts at white terror and savage suppression, they now raise the banner of economic opportunism, attempting to lead the great proletarian cultural revolution astray. But the Chinese workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, cannot be suppressed, deceived, or bought. We revolutionary rebels, together with the broad revolutionary masses, have swept away these evil winds and resisted the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Currently, we are pressing forward to thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism and ensure that the proletarian heaven in our country will never change color.

We are revolutionary rebels and also revolutionary builders. We want to smash the old world and build a bright new world. Recently, we have taken back all the power in the factory from those bourgeois masters. We have established a "Revolutionary Production Committee," following Chairman Mao's instructions to "seize the revolution and promote production," going against the current, taking the lead, and shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production, striving for a double harvest of revolution and production. Great Mao Zedong Thought is our highest directive, our guide to action, and the guarantee of our victory. We will unconditionally follow Chairman Mao's teachings and turn our factory into one that meets Chairman Mao's requirements, into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our great proletarian cultural revolution in China is a great revolution that shakes the world. Every victory and every revolutionary action of ours will make the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries tremble. Therefore, they are shouting and screaming in their futile attacks against us. Let them curse! Let them wail! The final victory will be ours!

Dear comrades! The storm of revolution has united us. Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, says: "'Though we are separated by thousands of miles, our hearts are close.' Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are united. We are your true friends and comrades. You are our true friends and comrades. We are not those false friends who are sweet-tongued but treacherous. We are not two-faced. Our revolutionary fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests." In the long years of revolution, our hearts have always been connected. We believe that the revolutionary fighting friendship between our two peoples will grow stronger day by day. No matter what happens in the world, our two peoples will definitely stand together, fight together, and win together forever.

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the great Albanian Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live, ten thousand times long live, our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao!

XINHUA, SHANGHAI, January 24 — The news of Albanian people in various places continuing to hold meetings to support the Shanghai revolutionary rebels has greatly encouraged and spurred on the Shanghai revolutionary rebels after reaching Shanghai. They are determined to learn from the great internationalist and revolutionary spirit of their Albanian comrades, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and to carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end! Today, the *Liberation Daily* in Shanghai, under the title "Salute to Albanian Comrades," published two letters to the workers of the Mao Zedong Textile Combine in Berat and the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory.

To the Workers of the Mao Zedong Textile Combine in Berat,

Dear Revolutionary Comrades:

With hearts full of excitement, we read your enthusiastic letter of congratulations in the *Liberation Daily*, which has just been taken over by the revolutionary rebels. For us, your letter is of special and precious value! China and Albania are both great socialist countries that hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. In the long struggle against our common enemies—imperialism and modern revisionism—our two peoples have formed an everlasting and unbreakable fighting friendship. We have always admired the brave and tenacious Albanian brothers who stand on the front lines of the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. The Chinese working class and the Albanian working class will always fight together and win together! Your telegram is a powerful support to us, Shanghai revolutionary rebel workers! Your telegram has greatly encouraged us! From this, we deeply feel that the revolutionary peoples of the world are deeply concerned about and strongly support the great proletarian cultural revolution underway in our country. In this unprecedented great revolution, the working class of China and the working class of Albania have always been heart to heart.

Our beloved leader, Chairman Mao, personally initiated and led the people of the whole country in carrying out a magnificent great proletarian cultural revolution, which has achieved extremely brilliant victories. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been defeated and are rapidly heading towards their doom. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is increasingly winning the hearts of the people and has been grasped by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, becoming an invincible powerful weapon to thoroughly defeat the bourgeois reactionary line! In this sharp and complex class struggle, we Shanghai revolutionary rebel workers have always followed Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings, firmly grasped Mao Zedong Thought, and under the care and support of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, after arduous and fierce struggles, we have smashed the savage attacks of the bourgeois reactionary line time and time again. To defend Chairman Mao, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend the proletarian dictatorship, we have taken back the power from the hands of those who are taking the capitalist road! The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will? We do not believe in any saviors; we only believe in the great Marxism-Leninism and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Once the revolutionary pioneering spirit of hundreds of millions of people is fully unleashed, it can move mountains and turn the world upside down! We not only dare to smash the old world to pieces but will definitely build a new world!

Dear comrades, our path of struggle is not smooth. A handful of stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line are unwilling to admit defeat and will not voluntarily leave the stage of history. Not long ago, this handful of people played new tricks, attempting to use improved material benefits and increased wages to split and disintegrate our revolutionary rebel ranks; they incited the masses they deceived to leave their production posts, attempting to use the despicable means of sabotaging production and socialist construction to sabotage the great proletarian cultural revolution. The enemy's trick is extremely cunning and vicious! But we, the proletarian revolutionary rebels armed with Mao Zedong Thought, cannot be deceived! White terror cannot frighten us, and "sugar-coated bullets" cannot defeat us! We promptly exposed the enemy's wicked trick and raised the resounding slogan: "Down with the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic opportunism!" We united with the broad masses, firmly guarded our labor posts, insisted on seizing the revolution and promoting production, and resolutely smashed the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line! In this struggle, our beloved Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao once again gave us timely and powerful support! Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee always strongly support us revolutionary rebels at the most critical and difficult moments of struggle. It is for this reason that we have been able to achieve victory in every struggle.

Dear revolutionary comrades, the unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution underway in our country is not only a struggle to defend the proletarian dictatorship and thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism but also a great revolution that touches the souls of every individual. Every revolutionary rebel fighter among us must, in this great revolution, while transforming the objective world, thoroughly transform our subjective world. Only in this way can we gradually forge ourselves into successors of the communist cause, can we ensure that revisionism will not emerge, and can we ensure that the proletarian heaven in our country will never change color!

Dear revolutionary comrades, the international reactionary forces centered around American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership are extremely hostile to the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. They are always dreaming of overthrowing our proletarian dictatorship, but we have the great leader Chairman Mao and the correct Chinese Communist Party, and your heroic country has the beloved Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor, which has been tested in long struggles and holds high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. The evil plots of these reactionaries centered around American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership will never succeed!

The Albanian working class is a heroic working class! The Albanian people are fearless and heroic! Under the correct and wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor, in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism, you have already achieved extremely brilliant victories, and your fearless struggle has made extremely outstanding contributions to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Dear comrades, dear friends! Your heroic country, the beloved Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the correct Albanian Party of Labor occupy an extremely glorious position in the history of the communist movement! We pay our proletarian revolutionary respects to you! Let the deep fighting friendship between the working classes and peoples of our two countries develop and strengthen in the struggle against our common enemies, and let it be everlasting in the storm of world revolution!

Long live the deep fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the great victory of Marxism-Leninism!

Long live the revolutionary spirit of proletarian rebellion!

Long live the heroic Albanian working class!

Long live the heroic Albanian people!

Long live our Marxist-Leninist parties in both countries, our beloved leaders Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha!

To the Workers of the Tirana Tractor Parts Factory,

Dear Comrades and Fellow Fighters:

At a time when the proletarian revolutionary line represented by our great leader Chairman Mao is engaged in a decisive battle with the bourgeois reactionary line, you sent us a letter full of revolutionary passion from the distant land of the eagle. This is the greatest support, greatest encouragement, and greatest inspiration to the Chinese working class. We, the revolutionary rebels and all revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Automobile Transport Company Repair Factory, express our heartfelt thanks to you and pay our proletarian cultural revolution respects to you.

"Though we are separated by thousands of miles, our hearts are close." Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, the red hearts loyal to Marxism-Leninism unite our two peoples. The heroic Albanian people, under the correct leadership of the glorious Albanian Party of Labor led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, firmly hold high the invincible red banner of Marxism-Leninism, always standing on the front lines of the revolution, and in the midst of the encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism, have become a great socialist beacon in Europe. You fear no violence and fight resolutely; your heroic spirit is forever our example to learn from; your spirit of "one hand holding a pickaxe and the other holding a gun" is forever our example to follow. We regard your great achievements on various fronts as our own achievements, and we regard your victories as our own victories. As our great leader Chairman Mao said: "We are your true friends and comrades. You are our true friends and comrades." We and you are inseparable close brothers.

Currently, as our great proletarian cultural revolution in China is achieving victory after victory and the bourgeois reactionary line is collapsing on all fronts, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have raised the banner of counter-revolutionary revisionist economic opportunism, advocating "economic welfare" and "material incentives," attempting to sabotage the magnificent workers' movement and strangle the great proletarian cultural revolution with these means. Facing this new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, we revolutionary rebels and all revolutionary workers, fearlessly and resolutely responding to the call of our country's people and the world's revolutionary people's great teacher Chairman Mao, insist on seizing the revolution and promoting production, and give a resounding slap in the face to the new challenge of the bourgeois reactionary line. We defy the black wind, resist the current, strive for strength, and rely on our own efforts. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have overcome various obstacles and, after arduous struggles, designed and manufactured China's first 150-ton heavy-duty flatbed trailer ourselves, achieving initial victories in both revolution and production. This is a heavy blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line.

Dear comrades and fellow fighters, we, all revolutionary workers, declare to you: In any difficult situation, we will stand with you. For defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, for continuously strengthening and consolidating the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, and for the common struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, we will make the greatest contributions. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and resolutely carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!

Long live the Albanian Party of Labor and its great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!

　　无产阶级革命精神把中阿两国人民的心紧紧连在一起
　　上海革命造反派工人复信阿尔巴尼亚工人感谢他们的支持和鼓舞
    新华社上海二十一日电　《解放日报》二十日发表了上海革命造反派工人给阿尔巴尼亚工人的两封复信，感谢他们给予上海革命造反派工人的巨大支持和热情鼓励。这两封信全文如下：
　　上海工人革命造反总司令部上海国营三十一棉纺印染厂毛泽东思想红旗战斗队给地拉那斯大林纺织联合工厂的信地拉那斯大林纺织联合工厂亲爱的同志们，战友们：
    正当我们在粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的斗争中取得决定性胜利的时候，读到了你们——来自英勇地站在反帝反修最前线的亲密战友热情洋溢的贺信，我们感到无比亲切和激动。你们的贺信，是对我们极大的支持和鼓舞。我们上海工人革命造反总司令部上海第三十一棉纺印染厂毛泽东思想红旗战斗队全体战士和全厂革命群众，向你们致以崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    你们在敬爱领袖和导师恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，在帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围之中，坚定地高举马列主义的革命红旗，“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策与战争政策，同以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义进行了针锋相对的斗争，表现了大无畏英雄气概和革命精神。真是“敌军围困万千重，我自岿然不动。”让帝国主义、现代修正主义及其走狗，在你们面前发抖吧！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。在他的亲自发动和英明领导下，当前我国正在进行一场无产阶级文化大革命。这是一场触及人们灵魂的史无前例的大革命，这是为了在我国彻底铲除修正主义根子的一场十分深刻的政治斗争。我们厂革命造反派坚决响应毛主席的号召：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”在这场斗争中，我们活学活用毛主席著作，天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，神不怕，“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”，起来大造资本主义和修正主义的反。可是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和极少数顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，眼看自己的老底被揭穿，宝座要倒塌，于是就耍阴谋，放暗箭，大搞经济主义，妄图把严肃的政治斗争引入歧途，转移斗争大方向，从而达到破坏无产阶级文化大革命和破坏生产的卑鄙目的。但这是万万办不到的。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命工人，心最红，眼最亮，及时地揭穿他们的诡计，严厉地抵制了他们的金钱和物质的引诱，彻底粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们每一个革命造反派战士，紧紧掌握十六条，抓革命，促生产。我厂一九六六年的年度生产计划按质按量超额完成，年度利润计划完成百分之一百零四点二五，成本降低百分之一点七六。毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。”事实非常雄辩地证明了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖的英明论断是无比正确的。在这一场斗争中，再次显示了毛泽东思想的无穷威力，这是毛泽东思想的新胜利。
    “天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”我们和你们虽然相隔万水千山，但无产阶级的革命精神把我们的心紧紧地连结在一起。我们的战斗友谊是万古长青的。亲爱的同志们、战友们！让我们永远肩并肩，手牵手地团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，坚决地将壮丽的共产主义事业进行到底，坚决地支援全世界革命人民把世界革命进行到底，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界奋勇前进！
      全世界无产者联合起来！
      中阿两国人民的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    伟大的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    我们伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万万岁！

      上海工人革命造反总司令部上海玻璃机械厂毛泽东思想战斗队和上海控江中学驻上海玻璃机械厂学工兵团联名写给阿尔巴尼亚恩维尔·霍查机器厂全体职工的信亲爱的恩维尔·霍查机器厂全体职工同志们：
    你们好！
    万分、万万分地感谢你们！你们的贺信，给了我们最最有力的支持和巨大的鼓舞。亲爱的同志们，我们虽然远隔万里，而我们的脉搏却时时刻刻在一起跳动。
    以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，是光荣的党、伟大的党、马克思列宁主义的党。阿尔巴尼亚人民，是英雄的人民。阿尔巴尼亚人民的大无畏的革命精神，放射着灿烂的光芒，是欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民永远是无产阶级革命者的光辉榜样，我们要努力学习你们这种革命精神，向你们致敬！
    当前，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，正沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，以及社会上的牛鬼蛇神，已经陷入广大革命群众的重重包围之中。但是，正如你们来信中所说的：“狈皮可换，本性难改”，他们是不甘心失败的。他们软硬兼施，在对我们进行白色恐怖、疯狂镇压失败以后，又祭起了经济主义这面资产阶级的破旗，妄图把无产阶级文化大革命运动引向邪路。中国工人是战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的，是压不倒、骗不了、收买不去的。我们革命造反派的工人，团结广大革命职工，舞起铁扫帚，横扫了这些妖风邪气，打退了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。目前，我们正乘胜追击，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子，保证我国的无产阶级江山永不变色。
    我们是革命的造反者，也是革命的建设者。我们要打烂旧世界，建设一个红彤彤的新世界。最近，我们已经把工厂的一切大权，从那些资产阶级老爷们的手里夺了回来。我们成立了“革命生产委员会”，遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，顶逆流，挑大梁，担起革命和生产的两副重担，力争革命和生产双丰收。伟大的毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的最高指示，是我们的行动指南，胜利的保证，我们一定不折不扣地遵照毛主席的教导，把我们的工厂，办成符合毛主席要求的工厂，办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场震动世界的大革命。我们的每一个胜利、每一个革命行动，都会使帝国主义者、修正主义者以及各国反动派发抖。因此，他们在力竭声嘶地攻击我们。就让他们诅咒吧！哀鸣吧！最后胜利必将属于我们！
    亲爱的同志们！革命的暴风雨把我们团结在一起。我们的伟大导师，伟大领袖，伟大统帅，伟大舵手，我们亿万人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席说：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”在长期的革命岁月中，我们始终心连着心。我们相信，我们两国人民之间的革命战斗友谊，将与日俱增。不管世界上发生了什么事情，我们两国人民一定会永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    全世界革命造反派联合起来！
    中阿两国人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    伟大的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！

    新华社上海二十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚各地群众继续集会支持上海革命造反派的喜讯传到上海后，给上海革命造反派以巨大的鼓舞和鞭策。他们决心学习兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚战友的伟大国际主义精神，革命精神，决心更加高高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！今天上海《解放日报》在上海革命工人《向阿尔巴尼亚战友致敬》的标题下，发表了两封给阿尔巴尼亚培拉特毛泽东纺织联合工厂和地拉那拖拉机配件厂职工的复信。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部国棉十七厂和“永远忠于毛泽东思想”战斗队的复信培拉特毛泽东纺织联合工厂全体职工同志：亲爱的革命战友们：
    我们以万分激动的心情，在革命造反派刚刚接管过来的上海《解放日报》上，看到了你们充满革命激情的贺信。对我们来说，你们的贺信有着特殊宝贵的价值！中国和阿尔巴尼亚都是高举马克思列宁主义大旗的、伟大的社会主义国家，我们两国人民在长期反对共同敌人——帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，结成了万古长青、牢不可破的战斗友谊，我们对战斗在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义最前线的、英勇顽强的、威武不屈的阿尔巴尼亚兄弟，始终感到无限敬佩。中国的工人阶级和阿尔巴尼亚的工人阶级永远战斗在一起，胜利在一起！你们的贺电，是对我们上海工人革命造反派的有力支持！你们的贺电使我们感到极大的鼓舞！从这里，我们深深体会到：全世界革命人民都在深切关怀和大力支持我国正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命。在这一场史无前例的大革命中，中国的工人阶级和阿尔巴尼亚的工人阶级始终心连着心。
    我国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导全国人民开展轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动，已经取得了极其辉煌的胜利。一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派已被打得落花流水，正在迅速地走向最后灭亡。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线日益深入人心，已经被亿万革命人民所掌握，成为彻底打倒资产阶级反动路线的、战无不胜的强大武器！我们上海工人革命造反派在这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中始终遵循毛主席的亲切教导，牢牢掌握毛泽东思想，在毛主席和党中央的关切与支持下，经过艰苦激烈的斗争，一次又一次地粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的猖狂进攻。为了保卫毛主席，保卫党中央，保卫无产阶级专政，我们已经从走资本主义道路的当权派手中把政权夺回来了！天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？我们不相信什么救世主，我们只相信伟大的马克思列宁主义和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。亿万人民群众的革命首创精神一旦充分发挥出来，就能排山倒海，扭转乾坤！我们不但敢于彻底砸烂旧世界，而且一定能建设一个新世界！
    亲爱的战友们，我们的斗争道路是很不平坦的。一小撮顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，不甘心灭亡，他们决不肯自动退出历史舞台。不久以前，这一小撮人玩弄新的阴谋，企图用提高物质福利和增加工资待遇的手段来分化、瓦解我们革命造反派的队伍；他们煽动被他们蒙蔽的群众离开生产岗位，企图用破坏生产、破坏社会主义建设的卑鄙手段来破坏无产阶级文化大革命。敌人的这个阴谋是非常阴险毒辣的！但是，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命造反派是欺骗不了的！白色恐怖吓不倒我们，“糖衣炮弹”打不垮我们！我们及时揭露了敌人的这个无耻阴谋，提出了“打倒反革命修正主义的经济主义”响亮的口号！我们团结广大群众，坚守劳动岗位，坚持抓革命，促生产，坚决粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！在这一次斗争中，我们敬爱的毛主席和以毛主席为首的党中央又一次给了我们及时而有力的支持！毛主席和党中央总是在斗争最艰苦的关键时刻，最有力地支持我们革命造反派，正因为如此，我们才能够在历次斗争中取得胜利。
    亲爱的革命战友们，在我国进行的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，不但是保卫无产阶级专政，彻底挖掉修正主义根子的夺权斗争，同时又是一场触及每个人灵魂的伟大革命。我们革命造反派的每个战士，都要在这场大革命中，在改造客观世界的同时，彻底改造自己的主观世界，只有这样，我们才能够逐步把自己锻炼成为共产主义事业的接班人，才能够保证不出修正主义，才能够使我国无产阶级的江山永不变色！
    亲爱的革命战友们，以美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团为中心的国际反动势力，对我们中阿两国人民的战斗友谊是无比仇恨的，他们无时无刻不在梦想着颠覆我们的无产阶级专政，但是，我们有伟大的领袖毛主席和英明正确的中国共产党，你们英雄的国家有敬爱的恩维尔·霍查同志和久经斗争考验的高举马克思列宁主义大旗的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，这些以美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团为中心的反动家伙的罪恶阴谋永远不会得逞！
    阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级是英雄的工人阶级！阿尔巴尼亚人民是英勇无畏的人民！你们在恩维尔·霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明、正确的领导下，在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争中，已经取得了极其辉煌的胜利，你们英勇不屈的斗争，已经对无产阶级革命事业作出了极其出色的贡献。亲爱的战友们，亲爱的同志们！你们英雄的国家，敬爱的恩维尔·霍查同志和英明正确的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在共产主义运动史上，是占有极其光荣的地位的！我们谨向你们致以无产阶级的革命敬礼！让我们两国工人阶级和两国人民的深厚战斗友谊，在对待共同敌人的斗争中更加发展，更加巩固，在世界革命的暴风雨中万古长青！
    中阿两国人民深厚的战斗友谊万岁！
    马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利万岁！
    无产阶级的革命造反精神万岁！
    英勇的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级万岁！
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民万岁！
    我们两国的马克思列宁主义政党、我们敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席和恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！

      上海汽车运输公司修理厂革命造反派和全体革命职工的复信地拉那拖拉机配件工厂：亲爱的战友们：亲爱的同志们：
    正当以我们伟大的领袖毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线与资产阶级反动路线处于决战的关键时刻，你们从遥远的山鹰之国寄来了充满革命激情的贺信。这是对我们中国工人阶级最大的支持，最大的鞭策和最大的鼓舞。我们上海市汽车运输公司修理厂的革命造反派和全体革命职工，向你们表示衷心的感谢，并致以无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼。
      “海内存知己，天涯若比邻”。中阿两国虽然远隔万水千山，但忠于马列主义的红心把我们两国人民紧紧连在一起。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，坚定不移地高举起战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，始终站在革命的最前线，在帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围中，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。你们不畏强暴，坚决斗争的英雄气概永远是我们学习的光辉榜样；你们“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的革命精神，永远是我们学习的范例。我们把你们在各条战线上所取得的巨大成就，看成是自己的成就，我们把你们的胜利，看成是自己的胜利。正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所说的那样：“我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。”我们和你们是不可分割的亲密兄弟。
    目前，正当我国无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利，资产阶级反动路线日趋全线崩溃的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，扯起了反革命修正主义的经济主义的破旗，大讲“经济福利”，大搞“物质刺激”，妄图以此破坏轰轰烈烈的工人运动，扼杀无产阶级文化大革命。面对这种资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，我们革命造反派和全体革命职工，毫无畏惧地坚决响应我国人民和世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的号召，坚持抓革命，促生产，对资产阶级反动路线的新挑战予以迎头痛击。我们顶黑风，反逆流，奋发图强，自力更生，终于在毛泽东思想的指引下，战胜了各种阻力，经过艰苦的斗争，自己设计，自己制造出我国第一台一百五十吨重型平板挂车，取得了革命、生产的初步胜利。这是对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的人当头一棒。
    亲爱的战友们，我们全体革命职工向你们表示：在任何艰难困苦情况下，我们都将和你们站在一起，为捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，为不断加强和巩固中阿两国人民的战斗友谊，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的共同斗争，作出最大的贡献。我们一定更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，挑起革命和生产的两副担子，誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    中阿两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党及其伟大的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
