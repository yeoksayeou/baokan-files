    Chairman Mao's book in hand,
    The oil workers of Daqing
    The amateur performance troupe of Daqing Oil Field created "Chairman Mao's Book in Hand." Thousands and tens of thousands of times it is not enough to look at. It's like spring rain nourishing the seedlings, singing out with full passion. Chairman Mao's book in hand, every word is remembered in the heart. We are not afraid of dangerous rapids and strong waves, sailing the great sea relies on the helmsman. Chairman Mao's book in hand, revolutionary spirit surges in the heart. Standing in the oil field, looking towards Beijing, with a red heart, striding forward to the Party. Chairman Mao's book in hand, a red sun rises in the heart. Putting effort into every word, forever be the revolutionary "old yellow cow."

    毛主席的书捧在手
    大庆石油工人
    业余演出队创作毛主席的书捧在手，千遍万遍看不够。好像春雨浇禾苗，满腔激情唱出口。毛主席的书捧在手，句句话儿记心头。险滩急浪咱不怕，大海航行靠舵手。毛主席的书捧在手，革命豪情涌心头。身在油田望北京，红心向党大步走。毛主席的书捧在手，一轮红日出心头。用字上边下功夫，永当革命“老黄牛”。
