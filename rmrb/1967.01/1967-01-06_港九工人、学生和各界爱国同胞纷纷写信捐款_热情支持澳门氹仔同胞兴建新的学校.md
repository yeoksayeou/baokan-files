Workers, students, and patriots from various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon have been writing letters and donating money in support of the construction of a new school in Taipa, Macau. They are enthusiastically backing the patriotic education of the children of Chinese residents in Macau.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 5th, workers, students, and patriots from various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon have been writing letters to the *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao* newspapers, and sending in donations. They are enthusiastically supporting the construction of a new school in Taipa, Macau, for the patriotic education of the children of Chinese residents in Macau.

Hundreds of readers have expressed their strongest condemnation of the brutal actions of the Portuguese authorities in Macau, who have obstructed the construction of school buildings in Taipa and massacred Macau residents. They have also expressed their strongest support for the brave struggle of the patriotic residents of Macau against violence. Some readers wrote, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' The more the Portuguese authorities in Macau oppose the construction of schools by the residents of Taipa, the more we must support them." Other letters stated, "We firmly believe that the struggle of the Macau residents will be victorious. We must ensure that the flag of patriotism forever flies over Taipa and Macau. We must teach the imperialists a lesson: Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with."

Many letters expressed great indignation at the Portuguese authorities' continued use of two-faced tactics and delaying strategies regarding the four conditions proposed by the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Affairs Office and the six demands of the Macau residents. They warned the Portuguese authorities that they must immediately and fully implement our demands, close down all American and Kuomintang spy organizations, ban American and Kuomintang spy activities, and prohibit the display of the Kuomintang flag and insignia.

The donations from Hong Kong and Kowloon residents in support of the construction of the Taipa school amounted to over HK$101,000 by the end of last month. Many workers, students, and small traders have tightened their belts to make generous donations.

    港九工人、学生和各界爱国同胞纷纷写信捐款
    热情支持澳门氹仔同胞兴建新的学校
    据新华社香港五日电  港九工人、学生和各界爱国同胞连日来纷纷写信给《文汇报》和《大公报》，并送去捐款，热情支持澳门氹仔同胞兴建一所新的学校，向澳门中国居民的子女进行爱国教育。
    数以百计的读者来信最愤怒地谴责澳葡当局横蛮阻挠澳门氹仔同胞筹建校舍、屠杀澳门同胞的法西斯暴行；最热烈地支持澳门爱国同胞英勇的抗暴斗争。有的读者来信说：“毛主席教导我们：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’澳葡当局越是反对氹仔同胞建立自己的学校，我们就越是要支持。”有的来信说：“我们坚信：澳门同胞的斗争必定胜利，一定要让爱国主义旗帜永远在氹仔和澳门飘扬。一定要教训教训帝国主义者，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国同胞是不好惹的。”
    许多来信对澳葡当局继续对我广东省外事处提出的四项条件和澳门同胞的六项要求玩弄两面手法，耍赖拖延的态度，表示万分愤慨，并警告澳葡当局必须立即全部、彻底实现我方要求，查封一切美蒋特务机构，取缔美蒋特务活动，禁止悬挂蒋旗、蒋徽。
    港九同胞支持氹仔同胞建校捐款，截至上月底止共收到港币十万一千多元。不少工人、学生和小商贩节衣缩食，热情捐献。
