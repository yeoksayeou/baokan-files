"The people have no army, and the people have nothing."

This is the wise judgment of the great leader Chairman Mao. This is a universal truth that has been proven by practice.

Eighteen years ago, the people of Laos rose up and established their own armed forces. Over the course of eighteen years, relying on the people, they endured hardships, drove out the French colonialists, and defeated the American aggressors, growing into a strong and powerful people's army.

The development and victories of the Lao People's Liberation Army demonstrate: for oppressed peoples, the gun is how important!

With the gun, one can "sweep away all harmful insects, and have no enemies."

With the gun, one can transform the rivers and mountains, and bring about a new era.

With the gun, there is hope for the people, and there is everything for the people.

If the people of Laos had not ignited the spark of armed struggle eighteen years ago, they would not have achieved the great situation of today.

Of course, the people of Laos still face great enemies. Despite suffering repeated defeats, American imperialism will not give up easily. It will continue to expand its aggression and struggle desperately.

However, the people of Laos are a people who dare to fight and dare to win. They have already grasped the most effective weapon to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys, which is Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war. On the path of people's war, the people of Laos will certainly march from victory to greater victory.

　　最有效的法宝
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”
    这是伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断。这是已被实践证明了的普遍真理。
    十八年前，老挝人民揭竿而起，建立了自己的武装力量。十八年来，它依靠人民，历尽艰难，赶走了法国殖民者，挫败了美国侵略强盗，成长壮大为一支坚强有力的人民军队。
    老挝人民解放军的发展和胜利说明：对于被压迫人民，枪杆子是多么重要！
    有了枪杆子，就能“扫除一切害人虫，全无敌”。
    有了枪杆子，就能使河山改旧貌，日月换新天。
    有了枪杆子，就有人民的希望，就有人民的一切。
    老挝人民如果不在十八年前点起这场武装斗争的星星之火，就不可能打出今天这样的大好形势来。
    当然，老挝人民现在还有大敌当前。美帝国主义尽管连遭失败，但它决不会善罢甘休的。它还要扩大侵略，疯狂挣扎。
    但是，老挝人民是敢于斗争、敢于胜利的人民。他们已经掌握了足以战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝，这个法宝就是毛主席关于人民战争的思想。在人民战争的道路上，老挝人民必将从胜利走向更大的胜利。
