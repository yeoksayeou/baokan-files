Internationalists Serving the World's People

African and Asian Peoples Praise Chinese Experts Educated by Mao Zedong Thought

What has kept the spirits of Chinese experts so high over the past year? I have thought about this for a long time. It is Mao Zedong Thought that has made the difference. I believe that the world's revolutionary leaders of the past were Lenin and Stalin, but now it is Mao Zedong.

We have received immense, selfless aid from the Chinese government and have felt the great internationalist spirit of the Chinese people. The Chinese are hardworking and brave, all because the Chinese people have read Chairman Mao's books and have taken Mao Zedong Thought to heart.
		- A Friend, Nepal

I am happy to see that Chinese experts have imparted their knowledge and skills to Yemeni workers without reservation. What impresses me most is that Chinese experts have always followed Chairman Mao's teachings in their work and have helped Yemen in its construction.
		- Ali, Yemen

Chinese technicians are simple and polite, blending in with the residents and exchanging ideas with our people. They are willing to help anyone and are very simple and capable. They are completely different from other Western experts who have come to our country.
		- Midoul, Algeria

From the Chinese experts, I have seen the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and the future of humanity.
		- Kouyaté, Mali

We Tanzanians are fortunate to have such a good and sincere friend like China. You have helped us build an outstanding launchpad, and the Tanzanian people will benefit from it for generations to come. Thank you, Mao Zedong, the greatest leader!
		- Mohammed, Tanzania

Chinese workers and experts serve the Somali people wholeheartedly. They have achieved success in Somalia, which is also a source of pride for the Somali people.
		- Bashir, Somalia

    为世界人民服务的国际主义战士
    亚非人民赞扬毛泽东思想教育出来的中国专家
    中国专家一年多来情绪这么高，是什么起作用？我想了很长时间，是毛泽东思想起的作用。我想，过去世界革命领袖是列宁、斯大林，现在就是毛泽东了。
                              缅甸　吴丁貌
    我们从中国政府得到巨大的无私援助，感受了中国人民伟大的国际主义感情。中国人是勤劳勇敢的，这都是由于中国人民读了毛主席的书，毛泽东思想深入到每个人的心中。
                        尼泊尔　一位朋友
    我感到幸福的是：中国专家毫无保留地把自己的智慧和技术教给也门工人。最使我钦佩的是：中国专家在工作中，始终贯彻毛主席的教导，帮助也门进行建设。
                                  也门　阿里
    简朴而有礼貌的中国技术人员和居民打成一片，和我们的人民群众交流思想；他们愿意帮助任何人，他们非常简朴和聪明能干，他们和其他来我国的西方专家截然不同。
                      阿尔及利亚　米杜尔
    从中国专家身上，使我看到了毛泽东思想的光辉，看到了人类的未来。
                            马里　库亚特
    我们坦桑尼亚人民有中国这样好的真心朋友，这是我们莫大的荣幸。你们帮助我们建造了一座了不起的发射台，坦桑尼亚人民子子孙孙都将受益。感谢毛泽东，他是最伟大的领袖！
                      坦桑尼亚　穆罕默德
    中国工人和专家为索马里人民服务是一心一意的。他们在索马里取得了成功，这也是索马里人民的骄傲。
                            索马里　巴希尔
