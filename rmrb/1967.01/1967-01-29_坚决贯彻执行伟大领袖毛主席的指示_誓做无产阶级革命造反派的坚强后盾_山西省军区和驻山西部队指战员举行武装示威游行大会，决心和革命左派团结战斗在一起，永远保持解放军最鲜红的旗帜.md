Firmly Implement the Instructions of the Great Leader Chairman Mao
Vow to Be the Strong Backbone of the Revolutionary Rebels of the Proletariat
The Shanxi Provincial Military Region and Troops Stationed in Shanxi Hold an Armed Demonstration Parade, Determined to Fight United with the Revolutionary Leftists and Forever Maintain the Reddest Flag of the PLA

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 28th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army Shanxi Provincial Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi, which have made great contributions in supporting the proletarian revolutionary leftists in seizing power, held an armed demonstration parade yesterday despite the snow. They expressed their most resolute determination to implement the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, vowing to be the strong backbone of the proletarian revolutionary rebels, and firmly and actively support the proletarian revolutionary rebels in their struggle to seize power.

The entire city of Taiyuan and both banks of the Fen River were adorned with red flags and echoed with the sound of war drums. The Shanxi Provincial Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi, with their actual actions, once again gave great encouragement and support to the Shanxi revolutionary rebels, boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary forces and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeois rightists.

From early yesterday morning, fully armed PLA soldiers and Shanxi revolutionary rebels marched towards the center of Taiyuan, the "May 1st Square," despite the cold. The square presented a scene of revolutionary struggle. The broad masses of soldiers and Shanxi revolutionary rebels continuously shouted slogans: "Proletarian revolutionary rebels unite! Resolutely seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party!" "All power to the proletarian revolutionary rebels!" "The People's Liberation Army firmly stands on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries!" "Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!" "Long live, long live, long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!"

At around 10 o'clock, the meeting began. The entire audience sang "The East is Red." People held up red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud: "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. All reactionary things, if you do not beat them, they will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor. If the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." "Resolve to overcome all difficulties, not fearing sacrifice, and strive for victory."

A responsible comrade from a certain unit of the stationed troops, representing the Shanxi Provincial Military Region and all the soldiers and officers stationed in Shanxi, spoke first at the meeting. He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us that the People's Liberation Army should actively support the broad masses of the left. Chairman Mao's instructions are a new mobilization order for the entire army and the people of the whole country, and the greatest encouragement and support for the revolutionary leftists. Chairman Mao has entrusted this glorious task to the People's Liberation Army, and we will resolutely implement it. We are determined to unite with the Shanxi proletarian revolutionary rebels under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary leftists, resolutely support and assist the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, and forever maintain the reddest flag of the People's Liberation Army."

A representative from the "Heroic Eighth Company" of a certain unit of the stationed troops said in his speech, "We are always ready to suppress and implement the dictatorship of the proletariat against those who sabotage the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the counter-revolutionary organizations! If the enemy does not surrender, we will make it perish completely!"

The secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party, the first secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Committee, Clam Vibration, spoke at the meeting on his behalf and on behalf of the revolutionary leading cadres Liu Ge Ping, Liu Guan Yi, He Ying Cai, and Chen Shou Zhong in the Shanxi leadership organs. He said, "The Shanxi Provincial Military Region and the Shanxi stationed troops have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and at the critical moment of the life-and-death struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line, stood out and resolutely supported and assisted the Shanxi proletarian revolutionary rebels in seizing power, making great contributions to the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. We must learn from the PLA, forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely stand on the side of the revolutionary rebels, unite with the revolutionary rebels, combine internal and external forces, and launch a comprehensive offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory! The representative of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and the representative of the Taiyuan Revolutionary Rebel Command also spoke at the meeting.

The meeting read a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin.

The meeting ended, and a grand armed demonstration parade began. The PLA soldiers, riding in 200 military trucks, marched in seven columns through the city streets, heading towards factories, mines, and schools. The PLA soldiers held high the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Firmly support the proletarian revolutionary rebels!" They also distributed leaflets with Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary masses.
