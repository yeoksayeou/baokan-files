The PLA warmly welcomes the decision by our great leader Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to approve the Central Military Commission's reorganization of the Army Cultural Revolution Group. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the army will surely take on a new look.

The joyous news that our great leader Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have approved the reorganization of the Army Cultural Revolution Group by the Central Military Commission quickly spread throughout the army's various departments, units, and academies like a spring breeze. It was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of soldiers and officers. They unanimously expressed that the establishment of the new Army Cultural Revolution Group is the greatest concern and encouragement from the great helmsman Chairman Mao for our entire army. Everyone is convinced that under the direct leadership of the Central Military Commission and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our army will surely take on a new look and achieve even greater victories. The broad masses of soldiers and officers expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the new Army Cultural Revolution Group, resolutely fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line within the army, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and eliminate the pernicious influence of this reactionary line in the army, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our army to a new stage and doing a better job in all aspects.

In Beijing, the revolutionary students and teachers of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, various military branches, and various departments and academies, as well as the cultural workers of the units, heard the good news and immediately formed joyous teams. Holding high red flags and carrying giant portraits of Chairman Mao, they marched in a continuous stream to the reception station of the new Army Cultural Revolution Group to express their determination. The reception station was filled with new red banners: "Warmly welcome the birth of the new Army Cultural Revolution Group!" "Swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" Inside and outside the reception station, drums and gongs resounded, and the air was filled with joy. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the clouds. Everyone sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" over and over again, and read Chairman Mao's quotations time and time again. From morning to night, the entire reception station was filled with a festive and joyous atmosphere.

When the good news reached the units in Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Kunming, Wuhan, and Chengdu, as well as the Navy and Air Force units, from the frontline trenches, sentry posts, and anti-aircraft positions to airports, harbors, and ships, shouts of "Firmly support the wise decision of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee!" and "Long live, long, long live our great leader Chairman Mao!" rose and fell in waves. Amidst the drumming, the soldiers sent one red joyous notice after another to the leadership departments. Homing Feng, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the entire army, was extremely moved and said, "I support with both hands the wise decision of the Central Military Commission to reorganize the Army Cultural Revolution Group! This decision marks the complete failure of the bourgeois reactionary line in our army and the brilliant victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We are confident that with the leadership of the new Army Cultural Revolution Group, approved by our supreme commander Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the cultural revolution in our entire army will surely follow Chairman Mao's revolutionary line from victory to victory." Gao Dongsheng, an old soldier of the Red Army from a certain unit in Lanzhou, said, "The People's Liberation Army is the people's army created by Chairman Mao, the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the staunch defender of the cultural revolution. Carrying out the cultural revolution in the entire army has even greater significance. Chairman Mao's approval of the reorganization and establishment of the new Army Cultural Revolution Group ensures that the cultural revolution in the entire army will be carried out even better." Yan Fugen, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a five-good soldier from a certain unit, said, "Reorganizing the Army Cultural Revolution Group is a major event in the political life of the entire army. Comrade Xu Xiangqian serving as the director of the new Army Cultural Revolution Group and Comrade Jiang Qing serving as the consultant of the Army Cultural Revolution Group is Chairman Mao's greatest concern for our army." The ethnic minority soldiers stationed on the Awawa Mountain in the southwestern border of the motherland, heard the good news on the radio, sang and danced in joy: "The great leader points the direction, the revolutionary storm rolls the giant waves, the establishment of the new army cultural revolution, the leader's concern warms the heart. Awawa Mountain is cheering, Lancang River is singing."

	Cheering for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line
	New victories,
	Singing in the heart the reddest red
	Red sun.

The soldiers and officers in Shenyang, Lanzhou, Beijing, Jinan, and the Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang Military Districts cheered for this great news and pointed out that the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary masses resolutely smashed the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and the cultural revolution has entered a new stage. Everyone is determined to hold high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao under the leadership of the new Army Cultural Revolution Group, advance bravely on the path of the cultural revolution guided by Chairman Mao, and strive for new victories. The soldiers and officers of the "Dajian Island Battle Model Company" in the Fuzhou Military District solemnly swore while holding high the portrait of Chairman Mao and the plaque of Chairman Mao's quotations: "We, the revolutionary soldiers guarding the forefront of the East China Sea, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, we support the leadership of the new Army Cultural Revolution Group the most firmly, we support the revolutionary leftists the most firmly, we resolutely smash the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!" The soldiers and officers of the Navy's "Sea Tiger Boat" listened to the broadcast twice in a row. Everyone expressed in a discussion that we are revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the most resolutely and thoroughly. In this struggle to uproot the old roots of revisionism, we will definitely stand with the broad revolutionary masses, carry forward the daring and fearless spirit of the "tiger," and bravely open fire on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory.
