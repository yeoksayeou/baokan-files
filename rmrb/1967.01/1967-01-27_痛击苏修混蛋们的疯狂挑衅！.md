On January 25, on Moscow's Red Square, in front of the mausoleum of the great leader Lenin, a shocking incident occurred where Soviet military police and plainclothes agents brutally suppressed our country's transit students. This is a mad provocation by the Soviet revisionist counter-revolutionary clique against the Chinese people, and it is another blood debt they owe to the Chinese people. The Chinese people strongly protest against this fascist atrocity by the Soviet revisionists! Listen, you bunch of Soviet revisionist scoundrels: the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with! The blood debt you owe will definitely be repaid! Your provocations, we will definitely counterattack resolutely!

What crime did our students commit? They paid tribute to the great leader of the world proletarian revolution, Lenin, and the great Marxist-Leninist, Stalin, by laying wreaths at their mausoleums, expressing their admiration; they read quotations from Chairman Mao at Lenin's mausoleum, pointing out that the socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is a hundred percent revolutionary action. Yet, you treated our students as enemies and attacked them. This fully exposes you as traitors to Lenin, traitors to socialism, traitors to the Soviet people, and traitors to the world revolution!

You are on intimate terms with imperialism and reactionaries, and you open the green light to capitalist culture; yet, you hate revolutionary people and revolutionary thought to the core, fearing them to death. Your bloody suppression of our students is no different from the tsars, Hitler, and the Ku Klux Klan! This fully proves that what you are doing in the Soviet Union is the most reactionary and barbaric fascist dictatorship.

Currently, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage of revolutionary rebels uniting and seizing power from those in authority who are taking the capitalist road. At this very moment, the Soviet revisionists created this political provocation, which is certainly not accidental. Our proletariat is launching a general offensive against the bourgeoisie, and the class enemy is in a state of collapse, making the old men in the Kremlin pale with fear, trembling with fear, and anxious beyond measure. The Soviet revisionists' creation of this bloody incident is essentially a class revenge by the international class enemy against the revolutionary people. This concentrates the imperialists', revisionists', and reactionaries' deep hatred and extreme fear of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

What are these Soviet revisionist traitors afraid of? In a word, they are afraid that the influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong Thought will awaken the Soviet people, rise up to rebel against them, seize their power, overthrow them, smash their revisionist order, and overturn their cannibalistic banquet!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the Soviet revisionists madly oppose our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the more it proves that we are right and doing well, and we must definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. The more they madly oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought, the more it proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of revolution, and we must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our 69 students, unyielding to violence, upholding the truth, fought bravely against the fascist thugs and are truly good sons and daughters of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We extend our warmest greetings to the 69 brave anti-revisionist fighters and salute you with the fighting spirit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We eagerly await your victorious return!

Our students read the following words of our great leader Chairman Mao at Lenin's mausoleum: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur, and will definitely be victorious, whether sooner or later." How well they read it!

The Soviet people are the great people who have been taught by Lenin and Stalin and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. They will not endure the dark rule of revisionism for long. They will definitely rise up to rebel against revisionism, making the Soviet Union return to the socialist path. Today, the sparks of revolutionary rebellion have already appeared on the land of the Soviet Union. The days of the Soviet revisionist leadership are numbered. The Chinese people stand firmly with the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union. We believe that the brilliant red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will one day fly high over Red Square, fly high over the homeland of the October Revolution!

Down with modern revisionism!

Long live the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian rebellion!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

　　痛击苏修混蛋们的疯狂挑衅！
    一月二十五日，在莫斯科红场上，在伟大的列宁陵墓前，发生了苏联军警、便衣特务野蛮镇压我国过境留学生的骇人听闻的流血事件。这是苏联反革命修正主义领导集团对中国人民的疯狂挑衅，是他们对中国人民欠下的又一笔血债。中国人民对苏修的这种法西斯暴行提出最最强烈的抗议！一小撮苏修混蛋们，你们听着：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民不是好惹的！你们欠的血债是一定要偿还的！你们的挑衅，我们一定坚决反击！
    我国留学生到底犯了什么罪？他们向世界无产阶级革命的伟大导师列宁和伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林陵墓献花圈，表示敬仰；他们在列宁陵墓前朗读毛主席语录，指出社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度。这是百分之百的革命行动。可是，你们却对我国留学生视若仇敌，大打出手。这彻底地暴露了你们是列宁的叛徒，社会主义的叛徒，苏联人民的叛徒，世界革命的叛徒！
    你们同帝国主义和反动派打得火热，对资本主义文化大开绿灯；然而，你们对革命人民和革命思想却是恨之入骨，怕得要死。你们血腥镇压我国留学生的暴行，同沙皇、希特勒、三Ｋ党何其相似！这充分证明你们在苏联搞的是最反动、最野蛮的法西斯专政。
    目前，我国无产阶级文化大革命进入革命造反派大联合，向走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的新阶段。正当这个时候，苏修制造这样的政治挑衅事件，绝非偶然。我国无产阶级向资产阶级展开总攻击，阶级敌人处于全线崩溃的形势，使克里姆林宫里的老爷们脸色如土，两脚发颤，惶惶不可终日。苏修制造这次流血事件，实质上是国际阶级敌人对革命人民的一次阶级报复。这集中地反映了帝国主义、修正主义和反动派对我国无产阶级文化大革命，对伟大的毛泽东思想的刻骨仇恨和无比恐惧。
    苏修这一小撮叛徒害怕什么呢？一句话，就是害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响、毛泽东思想的影响，会促进苏联人民的觉醒，起来造他们的反，夺他们的权，革他们的命，砸烂他们的修正主义秩序，掀掉他们吃人的筵席！
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”苏修越是疯狂地反对我国无产阶级文化大革命，就越证明我们做得对，做得好，我们就一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他们越是疯狂地反对伟大的毛泽东思想，就越证明毛泽东思想是革命的真理，我们就一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗。
    我国六十九名留学生，不畏强暴，坚持真理，同法西斯暴徒进行了英勇的搏斗，不愧为毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的好儿女。我们向六十九名英勇的反修战士致以最亲切的慰问，并致以无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼！我们殷切地等待着你们胜利归来！
    我国留学生在列宁墓前朗读了我们伟大领袖毛主席这样一段话：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”他们朗读得多么好啊！
    苏联人民是列宁和斯大林所教导过的、有着光荣革命传统的伟大的人民。他们决不会长期忍受修正主义的黑暗统治。他们终究要起来造修正主义的反，使苏联重新走上社会主义的道路。今天，革命造反的星星之火，已经出现在苏联的大地上。苏联修正主义领导集团的寿命已经不长了。中国人民同苏联革命人民是坚决站在一起的。我们相信，光辉灿烂的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的红旗，总有一天，会高高地飘扬在红场上，飘扬在十月革命的故乡！
    打倒现代修正主义！
    无产阶级革命造反精神万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
