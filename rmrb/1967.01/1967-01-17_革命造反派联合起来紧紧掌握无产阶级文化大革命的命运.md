Revolutionary rebels unite to firmly grasp the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

The revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai City, under the great banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, have implemented revolutionary unity, becoming the core of uniting all revolutionary forces. They have firmly grasped the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy in their own hands. The great achievement of the unity of proletarian revolutionary organizations in this cultural revolution is a shining example set by the revolutionary forces of Shanghai. We warmly acclaim: Excellent! Excellent!

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of political power. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to firmly grasp the political power of the proletarian dictatorship in our country and the leadership of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It is to achieve the leadership of all power to the left! The struggle between the two lines is a sharp and complex struggle for power!

To grasp the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy, what do the proletarian revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses rely on? They rely on the great thought of Mao Zedong, on the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebel organizations based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, and on the great unity of all revolutionary forces with the revolutionary rebel organizations as the core!

As early as 1848, the great leaders of the proletarian revolution, Marx and Engels, issued the great call to the world: "Workers of the world, unite!"

Our great leader, great commander, great helmsman, and great teacher, Chairman Mao, has repeatedly instructed us:

"The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the victory of our cause."

"Only through the unity of the Communist Party can the unity of the whole class and the whole nation be achieved, and only through the unity of the whole class and the whole nation can the enemy be defeated and the tasks of the national and democratic revolution be completed."

The history of the proletarian revolution is the history of the revolutionary people, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and under the leadership of the proletariat and its party, with the worker-peasant alliance as the basis, uniting and fighting. It is the history of the proletariat's constant and victorious struggle against the various schemes of new and old revisionists to split and divide. Every victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past few months has been achieved by the proletarian revolutionary rebels and the broad revolutionary masses, united and fighting together under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

A small handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and a small number of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, have foreseen their doom in the face of the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens step by step, as the revolutionary movements of workers, peasants, and revolutionary masses in the cultural sphere and party and government organs arise, and as revolutionary intellectuals unite with the worker-peasant masses, this small handful of reactionaries will inevitably further collude with the bourgeois elements, speculators, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society to form a counter-revolutionary alliance and fiercely resist the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The recent counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line is not the united action of all forces opposing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? The current all-out class struggle is not the struggle provoked by these counter-revolutionary forces? In the face of the arrogant challenge of the class enemy uniting, the proletarian revolutionary rebels need to unite more urgently, need to unite all revolutionary forces with the revolutionary rebel organizations as the core; use revolutionary unity to smash the counter-revolutionary unity!

In December last year, the revolutionary rebels of Beijing and other places, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, united to fight, exposing a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, anti-party conspirators, and two-faced schemers to the light of day, demonstrating the great power of the revolutionary rebel unity. Through this struggle, the counter-revolutionary camp hastily put together by those stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line quickly collapsed, the ranks of the revolutionary rebels rapidly expanded and strengthened, and the broad revolutionary masses, with the revolutionary rebel organizations as the core, further united under the banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Thus, at the beginning of 1967, a mighty revolutionary rebel army emerged, launching an unprecedented fierce attack on the bourgeois reactionary line. Now, the revolutionary comrades in Shanghai, in the battle to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, have achieved further unity, setting a new shining example for us.

Those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road are enraged by all this. They are most afraid of the great unity of the revolutionary rebels, most afraid of the great unity of the revolutionary masses. On the one hand, they continue to put together the counter-revolutionary unity, and on the other hand, they use every means to stir up contradictions everywhere, create splits, and try to disrupt and dismantle the great unity of the revolutionary rebel ranks.

As early as nineteen years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out in his brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" that when the enemy sees that the victory of the revolution can no longer be stopped by purely military means, they will pay more and more attention to political struggle. Chairman Mao said: "The policy of the American government has shifted from simply supporting the Nationalist Party's counter-revolutionary war to two forms of struggle: first, organizing the remaining military forces of the Nationalist Party and so-called local forces in South China and remote provinces to continue resisting the People's Liberation Army; second, organizing opposition within the revolutionary ranks, trying to stop the revolution here; if it is to advance further, it must be in a moderate color, and must not infringe too much on the interests of imperialism and its running dogs." Now, as we review Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment, we feel especially close. Those reactionaries who still refuse to surrender today, seeing that the method of openly and nakedly attacking the revolutionary line with the banner of the bourgeois reactionary line is too unpopular, instead only makes the revolutionary rebels unite more firmly, so they have adopted more covert methods.

They divide their controllable forces into smaller units, change their appearance, and raise the banner of "revolutionary rebellion" to try to infiltrate the ranks of the revolutionary rebels; they try to pull some people within the revolutionary rebels to organize opposition, so as to sing a different tune from the true revolutionary rebels, while covering up their true colors with the posture of "internal debate."

They take advantage of the opportunity for the revolutionary rebel organizations to rectify themselves, seize on some shortcomings and errors that the revolutionary rebels inevitably have in the stormy class struggle, distort and exaggerate them, and try to use "criticism" and "help" as a cover to slander and attack, fundamentally negating the revolutionary rebels and overthrowing the leadership position of the firm revolutionary left.

They use the pretext of "great democracy" to viciously attack the proletarian dictatorship, turning the revolutionary rebels' resolute defense of the proletarian dictatorship and proletarian great democracy into "suppression of the masses" (note, they are counter-revolutionaries, not the masses), and turning the hat of "executing the bourgeois reactionary line" back onto the proletarian headquarters and the proletarian revolutionaries.

They infiltrate various revolutionary organizations, trying to sow discord among revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary students, and between them, creating sectarian sentiments, inciting suspicion and mistrust between various revolutionary organizations, especially breaking the unity of revolutionary teachers and students with the worker-peasant masses.

While using the economic means of counter-revolutionary revisionism to deceive the masses and disrupt production, they also shoot the "sugar-coated bullets" of economic benefits at the revolutionary rebels, trying to corrupt and buy off some individuals in the revolutionary rebel ranks whose revolutionary will is not firm, making some people deviate from the correct direction of struggle and give up the struggle against them.

Their activities are often not carried out by themselves. They cunningly use some rightist confused thoughts and other non-proletarian thoughts among a part of the masses, put forward some slogans that confuse right and wrong, throw out some material benefits as bait, use the method of "infiltrating and pulling out," and incite and deceive some masses to split and disintegrate the ranks of the revolutionary rebels.

Their purpose in doing this is to try to make the revolutionary rebels fight among themselves, unable to take care of themselves, so that the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line throughout the country can succeed. What nonsense! What malice!

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." Thank those who plot conspiracies, they have become good negative teachers for the revolutionary masses, not only making the revolutionary rebels see more clearly, but also making those who have been deceived see more clearly. The enemy wants to create chaos and splits within us? The revolutionary masses will do the opposite! What they want to confuse, we will firmly distinguish! What they are most afraid of, we will strive to do!

The revolutionary rebels must unite! The revolutionary rebels must unite with all revolutionary forces! Revolutionary teachers and students must unite with the broad revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres!

The great unity and great unity we advocate are not compromise and moderation. We want great unity and great unity under the banner of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! It is the great unity and great unity with the firm revolutionary left as the core! Our unity and unity are not for the sake of a superficial "majority," not just for the sake of an organizational form, but for a more powerful struggle! Only when the revolutionary left unites closely can we more effectively win over the middle forces, unite the majority, and isolate and strike at a small handful of enemies!

We hope that those who have been instigated and incited, who regard the trivial issues within the revolutionary ranks as more important than the life-and-death class struggle, will, in the face of the great enemy, abandon all selfish thoughts and unite closely with the firm revolutionary rebels! Under the premise of unity in the revolutionary direction, seek common ground while reserving differences, and fight together!

We hope that comrades who have been deceived by those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road, such as those who truly want revolution in the "Capital Workers' Guard of Mao Zedong Thought" and the "Capital Red Guards Joint Action Committee," will return to the great banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and together with the revolutionary left, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

The revolutionary rebels must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen their ideological transformation, carry out revolution in the depths of their souls, and build our organizations into more proletarian and more combat-ready red teams! Only in this way can the foundation of our great unity and great unity be more solid.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally decided to broadcast to the whole country two important documents from the revolutionary mass organizations of Shanghai: the telegram of congratulations from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the January 12 editorial of the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, pushing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country to a new stage. The time for the proletarian revolutionary rebels to launch a general offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line has arrived! The fierce new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line will be thoroughly defeated! The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao will achieve even greater victories throughout the country! At this time when the all-out class struggle is raging throughout the country, the great unity of the revolutionary rebels in various systems, industries, and departments, and the great unity of revolutionary intellectuals with the worker-peasant masses, is inevitable and unstoppable!

"Many things are urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for the present moment." Revolutionary rebel comrades, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite! Take the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy into your own hands!

    革命造反派联合起来紧紧掌握无产阶级文化大革命的命运
    北京航空学院红旗战斗队
    上海市各革命造反组织，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大旗帜下，实行了革命的大联合，成为团结一切革命力量的核心，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里。无产阶级革命派组织的大联合，是这场文化大革命中的伟大创举，上海市的革命派为我们作出了光辉榜样。我们热烈地欢呼：一千个好得很，一万个好得很！
    革命的根本问题，是政权问题。无产阶级文化大革命，就是要把我国无产阶级专政的政权，把我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的领导权，紧紧掌握在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级革命派手里，就是要实现一切领导权归左派！两条路线的斗争，就是一场尖锐复杂的夺权斗争！
    无产阶级革命的造反派和广大革命群众要掌握无产阶级专政的命运，掌握无产阶级文化大革命的命运，掌握社会主义经济的命运，靠什么？靠伟大的毛泽东思想，靠无产阶级革命造反派组织在毛泽东思想原则基础上的大联合，靠一切革命力量以革命造反组织为核心的大团结！
    早在一八四八年，无产阶级革命的伟大导师马克思、恩格斯就向全世界发出了“全世界无产者，联合起来！”的伟大号召。
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席一再教导我们：
    “国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”
    “只有经过共产党的团结，才能达到全阶级和全民族的团结，只有经过全阶级全民族的团结，才能战胜敌人，完成民族和民主革命的任务。”
    无产阶级革命史，正是革命人民在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指导下，在无产阶级及其政党的领导下，以工农联盟为基础，团结战斗的历史，正是无产阶级不断同新老修正主义者形形色色的阴谋分裂活动坚决斗争并取得胜利的历史。几个月来无产阶级文化大革命的每一个胜利，都是无产阶级革命造反派和广大革命群众在毛泽东思想的指引下，团结一致，共同战斗所取得的胜利。
    一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利面前，他们已预感到末日的到来。随着无产阶级文化大革命的步步深入，随着革命的工人运动、农民运动、文化领域各界和党政机关的革命群众运动的兴起，随着革命的知识分子同工农群众相结合，这一小撮反动家伙势必要进一步和社会上的资产阶级分子，投机倒把分子，地、富、反、坏、右分子互相勾结起来，组成反革命的联合，死命对抗无产阶级文化大革命。最近资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，不正是一切反抗无产阶级文化大革命的腐朽势力的联合行动吗？当前这场全面的阶级斗争，不正是由这些反革命势力联合挑起来的吗？面对阶级敌人联合起来的猖狂挑战，无产阶级的革命造反派，更加迫切需要紧紧地联合起来，更加需要以革命造反组织为核心，把一切革命力量团结起来；用革命的大联合来粉碎反革命的大联合！
    去年十二月，北京和外地的革命造反派，在以毛主席为首的党中央的领导下，曾经联合作战，使一小撮反革命修正主义分子、反党阴谋家、玩弄权术的两面派，暴露于光天化日之下，显示了革命造反派大联合的伟大力量。通过这场斗争，使那些还在坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子所拼凑起来的反革命阵营迅速土崩瓦解，使革命造反派的队伍迅速发展壮大，广大革命群众以革命造反派组织为核心，进一步地团结在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线旗帜之下。这样，在一九六七年刚开始的时候，就出现了一支浩浩荡荡的革命造反大军，向资产阶级反动路线发起空前猛烈攻击的大好形势。现在，上海的革命战友，在粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的战斗中，实现了进一步的大联合，又为我们树立了新的光辉榜样。
    对于这一切，那一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，看在眼里，恨在心里。他们最害怕革命造反派的大联合，最害怕革命群众的大团结。他们一方面继续拼凑反革命的大联合，一方面千方百计，到处挑起矛盾，制造分裂，企图搅乱和整垮革命造反派队伍的大联合。
    早在十九年前，毛主席就在《将革命进行到底》这篇光辉著作中，一针见血地指出，当敌人看到革命的胜利已经不能用单纯的军事斗争方法加以阻止的时候，他们就一天比一天地重视政治斗争的方法。毛主席说：“美国政府的政策，已经由单纯地支持国民党的反革命战争转变为两种方式的斗争：第一种，组织国民党残余军事力量和所谓地方势力在长江以南和边远省份继续抵抗人民解放军；第二种，在革命阵营内部组织反对派，极力使革命就此止步；如果再要前进，则应带上温和的色彩，务必不要太多地侵犯帝国主义及其走狗的利益。”现在，我们重温毛主席的这一英明论断，感到特别亲切。那些至今不肯缴械投降的反动家伙，他们看到公开地、赤裸裸地打着资产阶级反动路线的破旗攻击革命派的方法已太不得人心，反而只能使革命造反派更加坚强地团结起来，于是，他们采用了更隐蔽的手法。
    他们把自己所能控制的势力，化整为零，改头换面，打起“革命造反”的旗号，力图钻进革命造反派的阵营；他们力图在革命造反派内部拉拢一些人，组织反对派，以便同真正的革命造反派唱对台戏，同时以“内部争论”的姿态掩盖自己的本来面目。
    他们利用革命造反派组织进行整顿的机会，抓住革命造反派在急风暴雨的阶级大搏斗中难免出现的一些缺点错误，加以歪曲、夸大，企图借“批评”、“帮助”之名，进行诬蔑和攻击，从根本上否定革命造反派，推翻坚定的革命左派的领导地位。
    他们打着“大民主”的幌子，恶毒攻击无产阶级专政，把革命造反派坚决保卫无产阶级专政和无产阶级大民主的革命行动说成是“压制群众”（注意，他们是反革命，不是群众），把“执行资产阶级反动路线”的帽子反扣到无产阶级司令部和无产阶级革命派头上。
    他们混入各种革命团体，竭力挑拨革命工人、贫下中农、革命干部、革命学生内部及相互之间的关系，制造宗派情绪，煽动各革命组织之间的怀疑和不信任，特别是破坏革命师生同工农群众相结合。
    他们在用经济主义的反革命修正主义手段来欺骗群众、破坏生产的同时，也把经济福利的“糖衣炮弹”射向革命造反派，企图腐蚀、收买革命造反派阵营中的个别革命意志不坚定的分子，使一些人脱离正确的斗争大方向，放弃同他们的斗争。
    他们的这些活动，往往不是自己亲自出马去干的。他们总是狡猾地利用一部分群众中的右倾糊涂思想及其他非无产阶级思想，提出一些混淆是非的口号，抛出一些物质利益的诱饵，采取“打进来、拉出去”的办法，煽动和蒙蔽一些群众，分化瓦解革命造反派的队伍。
    他们这样干的目的，就是妄图使革命造反派内部混战一场，自顾不暇，使全国范围的资产阶级反动路线的新反扑能够得逞。真是混帐之极！恶毒之极！
    “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”谢谢那些制造阴谋的家伙，他们充当了革命群众很好的反面教员，不仅使革命造反派更加擦亮了眼睛，也必将使上过当的一部分群众擦亮眼睛。敌人不是要在我们内部制造混乱、制造分裂吗？革命群众就是要反其道而行之！他们所要极力混淆的，就是我们所要坚决划清的！他们所最为害怕的，就是我们要努力去做的！
    革命的造反派，就是要联合起来！革命的造反派就是要同一切革命力量团结起来！革命的师生就是要同广大革命工人、贫下中农、革命干部联合起来！
    我们所说的大联合、大团结，绝不是调和、折中。我们要的是在毛主席的革命路线的旗帜下的大联合、大团结！是以坚定的革命左派为核心的大联合、大团结！我们的联合和团结不是为了凑个表面的“多数”，不是单纯追求一个组织形式，而是为了更有力地战斗！只有革命左派紧密地联合起来，才能更有效地争取中间派，团结大多数，孤立和打击一小撮敌人！
    我们希望那些受了挑拨煽动，把革命派内部的枝节问题看得比你死我活的阶级大搏斗还重要的人，在大敌当前之际，抛除一切私心杂念，同坚定的革命造反派紧紧地团结起来！在革命大方向一致的前提下，求同存异，共同战斗！
    我们希望受党内走资本主义道路的当权派欺骗的同志，例如“首都工人毛泽东思想捍卫团”、“首都红卫兵联合行动委员会”中那些真正要革命的人，回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大旗帜下，同革命左派一起，彻底打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    革命造反派一定要努力活学活用毛主席著作，加强自己的思想改造，在灵魂深处闹革命，把我们的组织建设成更加无产阶级化、更加战斗化的红色队伍！只有这样，我们的大联合、大团结的基础才能更加巩固。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自决定向全国广播上海各革命群众组织的两个重要文件：中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组的贺电和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志一月十二日社论，把我国无产阶级文化大革命推向了一个新阶段。无产阶级革命造反派向资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击的时候到来了！资产阶级反动路线猖狂的新反扑必将彻底破产！以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线必将在全国取得更加伟大的胜利！在当前全国全面的阶级斗争轰轰烈烈开展起来之时，各系统、各行业、各部门革命造反派的大联合，革命知识分子同工农群众的大团结，势在必行，不可阻挡！
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”革命造反派的战友们，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，联合起来！自己掌握无产阶级专政的命运，掌握无产阶级文化大革命的命运，掌握社会主义经济的命运！
