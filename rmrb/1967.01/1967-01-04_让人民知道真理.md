When the Chinese student delegation participated in the International Student Cultural Festival held in Paris last September, one day a student from Haiti suddenly came to visit. He told the Chinese comrades that he had read many of Chairman Mao's works. He deeply felt that the Haitian people must learn Mao Zedong Thought in order to shake off imperialism and gain independence and freedom.

He enthusiastically told the Chinese comrades, "We love Mao Zedong. He is the person we are most familiar with and respect the most. China is the hope of humanity, China is the future of humanity."

When the conversation ended, he said that after he returns to his country, he will take out all the books of Chairman Mao he has and set up a workers' library to let the people know the truth.

    让人民知道真理
    当去年九月中国学生代表团参加在巴黎举行的大学生国际文化联欢节的时候，有一天一个海地学生突然找来了。他对中国同志说：他读过许多毛主席著作。他深深感到，海地人民要摆脱帝国主义，得到独立自由，就必须学习毛泽东思想。
    他满怀热情地对中国同志说：“我们热爱毛泽东。他是我们最熟悉、最敬爱的人。中国是人类的希望，中国是人类的明天。”
    当谈话结束时，他说，他回国后，要把他所有的毛主席的书拿出来，办一个工人图书馆，让人民知道真理。
