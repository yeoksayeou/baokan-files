The symphonic music "Shajiabang" is a piece of symphonic music that belongs to the proletariat and the laboring people. It is a symphonic music "created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and utilized by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." It is a shining example of revolutionary cultural workers who have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed the instructions of our Chairman Mao about making the past serve the present, making foreign things serve China, and innovating, to carry out a cultural revolution.

The success of the symphonic music "Shajiabang" tells us that we must reform the bourgeois old culture and also tells us how to carry out this reform.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art are class culture or literature and art, and they all belong to a definite political line."

Symphonic music is originally a foreign art form. Since the 18th and 19th centuries, foreign bourgeois symphonic music works have been hailed by the bourgeois masters and their lackeys as sacred "classics." Modern revisionists also claim it to be "art belonging to all mankind." For many years, this art form has belonged to the bourgeoisie and served the bourgeoisie.

Those so-called "classic" works of symphonic music, their content, for hundreds of years, has been nothing but a set of things: gods, ghosts, landlords, noble ladies, personal sanctity, love above all, dreams, death, tombs, and so on. Others are chaotic, crazy, low-level, and vulgar stuff. In a word, they all reflect the spiritual face of bourgeois decadence and boredom, all maintain the rule and oppression of the bourgeoisie, and maintain private ownership and private ideas. They are art.

Our country is a socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, in the 17 years since the founding of the country, in the cultural realm, counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang and Lin Mo-han have elevated the goods of the bourgeoisie, feudalism, and revisionism to the heavens. They eagerly praise these things, saying they are the "peak of human culture" and that the "experts" and "authorities" of the bourgeoisie every day and every hour use our socialist lecture halls to inject bourgeois literary poison into the youth. Whoever doubts these stinking things, they say you are "ignorant and uneducated." Whoever opposes these stinking things, they say you are "treasonous." After they produced bad works like "The Butterfly Lovers" according to the specifications of foreign bourgeois symphonic music, they wildly praised them. Why do they do this?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Their purpose in doing this is to spread the ideological influence of the exploiting classes and to create public opinion to prepare for the restoration of the bourgeoisie. If we let them continue to do this, we will face the danger of the party being overthrown, the country being destroyed, and heads rolling! We must oppose them, overthrow them, and make sure they never rise again! We must thoroughly criticize old literature and art, thoroughly reform old literature and art, and reform all superstructures that do not adapt to the socialist economic base. Symphonic music must be reformed to express the political content of the proletariat, making it a powerful weapon for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. "Without destruction, there is no construction; without clearing, there is no flow; without stopping, there is no progress." This is a life-and-death class struggle!

The symphonic music "Shajiabang" was created under the personal guidance and care of Comrade Jiang Qing, smashing the various obstacles and sabotage of a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang. It is the pioneer of proletarian symphonic music.

Firstly, its content is entirely new, expressing the revolutionary political content of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and only the people, are the motive force of world history." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the symphonic music "Shajiabang" wholeheartedly praises the revolutionary struggle of the people of our country under the leadership of the proletariat. It successfully portrays the brilliant images of revolutionary heroes such as Guo the Commander, Ah Qing, and Grandma Sha. Therefore, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers understand it, praise it, and love it.

The symphonic music "Shajiabang" is full of revolutionary passion, describing the brave and unyielding struggle of the people, and praising the great achievements of the people. For example: Guo the Commander leading the wounded and sick comrades to fight against the enemy, looking at the vast and beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, being in Shajiabang but having his heart on the battlefield, that segment of music and singing deeply expresses the lofty thought of our military cadres and soldiers who cherish the motherland and strive wholeheartedly for the interests of the people. Guo the Commander hearing the enemy's gunshots, seeing through the enemy's tricks, and deciding to break through the enemy's siege and blockade, that segment of music and singing strongly expresses the revolutionary heroic spirit of our military cadres and soldiers to "overcome all enemies and never be subdued by the enemy." Grandma Sha's singing and music are just and stern. Her fearless revolutionary spirit of being willing to "smash her body to pieces for the revolutionary cause" stands like a high mountain in front of the enemy! Even the most cunning enemy and the most ruthless executioner are at a loss and have no way out. Ah Qing bravely and wisely fights against the enemy in a very dangerous environment, finally smashing the enemy's plots and persecution, and achieving victory. Ah Qing's singing is high-spirited and calm, optimistic and confident. The description of the symphonic music makes Ah Qing's revolutionary style appear extremely noble. They are all people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and they are our examples to learn from. On the other hand, the music of the negative characters depicts the stupid, brutal, cunning, and vicious faces of the enemy, expressing the inevitable doom of the enemy. The symphonic music "Shajiabang" truly plays the role of "uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy." It teaches us to serve the people wholeheartedly, to "make up our minds, not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," to be selfless, to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our souls and worldviews. This is the great achievement of the symphonic music "Shajiabang."

The symphonic music "Shajiabang" also has great innovations in its artistic form.

The old form of symphonic music has long been rigid. According to those foreign dogmas, how music should be written, where certain melodies must be used, where certain textures must be used... these frameworks are even more rigid than the eight-legged essay. How can such things express the thoughts and struggles of the revolutionary people of the proletariat? How can they serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers? They absolutely cannot! We must revolutionize, must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: innovate, make foreign things serve China. We must break away from that set of foreign frameworks that bind people's thoughts and tie people's hands, and must make the form serve the needs of revolutionary political content. The symphonic music "Shajiabang" has smashed the old frameworks of symphonic music to pieces! Where to use the orchestra to describe the stormy battle, where to use the chorus to express the revolutionary spirit of the people, what methods to use to reveal the sublime thoughts and feelings of revolutionary heroes, all these are decided according to the needs of revolutionary political content. The revolutionary struggle is so sharp and complex, the thoughts and feelings of revolutionary heroes are so sublime, as long as you express them appropriately, then it must be extremely rich and extremely vivid. This is something that the art of all exploiting classes cannot achieve. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The common feature of the art of all exploiting classes in their declining period is the contradiction between their reactionary political content and their artistic form." Only our proletarian new art can achieve the unity of revolutionary political content and as perfect as possible artistic form. After thoroughly breaking away from the frameworks of bourgeois symphonic music, the symphonic music "Shajiabang" truly achieves this unity.

The musical language of the symphonic music "Shajiabang" is based on the reform and innovation of Peking Opera music. It has distinct characteristics. The temperament of traditional Peking Opera music is difficult to express the thoughts and feelings of revolutionary heroes. The scale of traditional Peking Opera music is also difficult to express the great momentum of revolutionary struggle. To make the past serve the present, we must critically inherit and transform it. In this regard, the symphonic music "Shajiabang" also sets an example for us. It transforms the vulgarities in the original Peking Opera singing tunes that are detached from life, detached from the masses, and detached from political content, and through creation and development, gives it new life. The overture of the symphonic music "Shajiabang" integrates various tunes of Peking Opera, highly summarizes the overall content of "Shajiabang," and resonates with the chorus. The symphonic segments describing the battle atmosphere are gripping, giving people a strong inspiration. Using music, recitation, solo, chorus, duet, and other methods to depict heroic characters, it is fascinating and thought-provoking. Under the premise of expressing revolutionary political content, it combines Peking Opera music with the form of foreign symphonic music, making the whole work have the grand momentum of a large symphonic chorus and showing the characteristics of Peking Opera music, greatly expanding the expressive power of symphonic music. Deep revolutionary thoughts and surging revolutionary spirits are expressed so vividly and so plainly. This is truly a high level that any bourgeois symphonic music cannot compare with. How to use the principle of "making the past serve the present" and "making foreign things serve China" to reform the old artistic forms, the symphonic music "Shajiabang" has set an example for us. This is another great achievement of it.

The broad masses of the people warmly welcome the symphonic music "Shajiabang," and revolutionary people around the world give it high praise. It is truly the pioneer of new proletarian symphonic music and a new contribution to world revolutionary literature and art! We celebrate its brilliant achievements! We should learn from the revolutionary comrades who created and performed the symphonic music "Shajiabang"! We should learn from their proletarian revolutionary spirit of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, daring to think, daring to do, daring to pioneer, and daring to revolutionize. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end, and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line to strive for the creation of new proletarian literature and art. We should further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, break private interests and establish public interests, carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls, thoroughly transform our worldviews, and forever serve the people of the whole country and the people of the world!

    无产阶级交响音乐的开路先锋
    ——赞交响音乐《沙家浜》
    萧民
    交响音乐《沙家浜》，是一部属于无产阶级和劳动人民的交响音乐，是“为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的”交响音乐。它是革命的文艺工作者高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，遵照我们毛主席关于古为今用，洋为中用，推陈出新的指示，进行文艺革命的光辉样板。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》的成功说明，必须对资产阶级旧文艺进行改革，同时也告诉我们应当怎样去进行改革。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的”。
    交响音乐，原是一种外来的艺术形式。十八、十九世纪以来的外国资产阶级交响音乐作品，曾经被资产阶级老爷及其奴才们，说成是神圣的“经典”；现代修正主义者，也说它是“属于全人类”的艺术。多少年来，这种艺术形式是属于资产阶级的，是为资产阶级服务的。
    那些交响音乐的所谓“经典”作品，它们的内容，几百年来无非是那么一套，什么神呀，鬼呀，地主老爷、贵族小姐呀，个人神圣呀，爱情至上呀，梦呀，死呀，坟墓呀等等。另有一些则是杂乱、疯狂、低级、下流的货色。一句话，统统是资产阶级颓废无聊的精神面貌的反映，统统是维护资产阶级的统治和压迫，维护私有制和私有观念的艺术。
    我国是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。可是，建国十七年来，在文化领域里，周扬、林默涵等反革命修正主义分子，却把资产阶级、封建主义、修正主义的货色捧到天上。他们拚命美化那些东西，说它们是“人类文化的高峰”，资产阶级的“专家”“权威”们，每日每时地借着我们社会主义的讲堂，向青年灌输资产阶级文艺的毒素。谁怀疑这些臭货，他们就说你“愚昧无知”。谁反对这些臭货，他们就说你是“大逆不道”。当他们按照外国资产阶级交响音乐的规格，炮制出像《梁山伯祝英台》之类的坏作品之后，便疯狂地吹捧。他们究竟为什么要这样干呢？
    毛主席教导我们说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”他们那样干的目的，就是要散布剥削阶级的思想影响，就是要制造舆论，为资产阶级复辟做准备。如果让他们继续那样干下去，我们就有亡党、亡国、人头落地的危险！我们必须反对他们，打倒他们，叫他们永世不得翻身！必须彻底批判旧文艺，必须彻底改革旧文艺，必须改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑。交响音乐必须改革，让它表现无产阶级的政治内容，使它变成为工农兵服务的有力的武器。“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。”这是你死我活的阶级斗争！
    交响音乐《沙家浜》，是在江青同志的亲自指导和关怀下，粉碎了以周扬之流一小撮反革命修正主义分子的种种阻挠、破坏而创造出来的。它是无产阶级交响音乐的开路先锋。
    首先，它的内容是全新的，表现的是无产阶级的革命的政治内容。
    毛主席教导我们说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”按照毛主席的教导，交响音乐《沙家浜》以满腔热忱，歌颂了我国无产阶级领导下的人民群众的革命斗争。成功地塑造了郭指导员、阿庆嫂、沙奶奶等光辉的革命英雄形象。因之，广大工农兵群众就懂得它，赞扬它，热爱它。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》满怀着革命的激情，描写了人民群众英勇不屈的斗争，歌颂了人民群众的丰功伟绩。例如：郭指导员带领着伤病员同志与敌人斗争，眼望着祖国的大好河山，身在沙家浜，心在战场的那一段音乐和歌唱，深刻地表现了我军指战员心怀祖国，全心全意为人民的利益而奋斗的崇高思想。郭指导员听到敌人的枪声，识破了敌人的诡计，决心突破敌人的围困和封锁的那一段音乐和歌唱，强烈地表现出了我军指战员“要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的革命英雄主义精神。沙奶奶的歌唱和音乐，正义凛然，她老人家为革命利益“粉身碎骨也心甘”的大无畏的革命精神，像一座高山，矗立在敌人面前！使那最狡诈的敌人，最凶残的刽子手，都无计可施，走投无路。阿庆嫂在十分危难的环境中，勇敢机智地与敌人斗争，终于粉碎了敌人的阴谋和迫害，取得胜利。阿庆嫂的歌唱，高昂而镇定，乐观而有信心。交响音乐的描写，使阿庆嫂的革命风格，显得无比高尚。他们都是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，是我们学习的榜样。另外，反面人物的音乐，刻划出了敌人的愚蠢、残暴、狡猾、狠毒的面目，表现了敌人日暮途穷必然灭亡的本质。交响音乐《沙家浜》，对人民热情地歌颂，对敌人无情地暴露，确实发挥了“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的作用。它教育我们，要全心全意为人民服务，要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，要一心为公，要用毛泽东思想改造灵魂，改造世界观。这是交响音乐《沙家浜》的巨大成就。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》在艺术形式上也有很大的革新。
    旧的交响音乐形式早已僵死了，按照那些洋教条，音乐如何写法，什么地方必须要什么样的旋律，什么地方必须是什么样的织体……，这些框框比起八股文来有过之而无不及。这样的东西，怎么能表现无产阶级革命人民的思想感情和生活斗争呢？怎么能为工农兵服务呢？根本不能！必须革命，必须按照毛主席的教导：推陈出新，洋为中用。必须破除那一套束缚人的思想，捆住人的手脚的洋框框，必须使形式服从革命政治内容的需要。交响音乐《沙家浜》将交响音乐的旧框框打了个稀烂！什么地方用乐队描写急风暴雨般的战斗，什么地方用合唱表现人民群众的革命气概，用什么手法来揭示革命英雄们的崇高的思想感情，这一切都是根据革命政治内容的需要来决定的。革命斗争如此尖锐复杂，革命英雄人物的思想感情如此高尚，只要你恰当地表现出来了，那么，就必定是无比的丰富，无比的生动。这是一切剥削阶级的艺术所做不到的。毛主席教导我们：“处于没落时期的一切剥削阶级的文艺的共同特点，就是其反动的政治内容和其艺术的形式之间所存在的矛盾。”只有我们无产阶级的新文艺，才能达到革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一。交响音乐《沙家浜》在彻底破除了资产阶级交响音乐的框框之后，真正达到了这样的统一。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》的音乐语言，是在京剧音乐的基础上加以改革创新的，它具有鲜明的特色。传统京剧音乐的气质，难以表达革命英雄人物的思想感情，传统京剧音乐的规模，也难以表现革命斗争的巨大声势，要古为今用，就必须批判地继承，给以改造才行。在这方面，交响音乐《沙家浜》也为我们树立了榜样。它把原来京剧音乐唱腔中那些装腔做势、脱离生活、脱离群众、脱离政治内容的俗套子，加以改造，经过创造和发展，使它获得了新的生命。交响音乐《沙家浜》的序曲，融合了京戏的各类板腔，高度概括地展示了《沙家浜》内容的全貌，并以合唱与它相呼应。描写战斗气氛的交响乐段，扣人心弦，给人以强烈的鼓舞。用音乐、朗诵、独唱、合唱、对唱等各种手法刻划英雄人物，引人入胜，发人深思。在表现革命的政治内容的前提之下，将京剧音乐与外来交响乐形式结合起来，使整个作品，既有交响乐大合唱的庞大声势，又显示了京剧音乐的特色，大大地扩展了交响音乐的表现能力。深刻的革命思想，磅礴的革命精神，表现得如此形象，如此通俗，这是真正的高水平，是任何资产阶级交响音乐无法与之相比拟的。如何运用“古为今用”“洋为中用”的原则改革旧的文艺形式，交响音乐《沙家浜》给我们做了示范。这是它的又一个巨大成就。
    广大的人民群众热烈欢迎交响音乐《沙家浜》，世界上革命的人民给予它极高的评价。它真正是无产阶级新交响音乐的开路先锋，是对世界革命文艺的新贡献！我们欢呼它的辉煌成就！我们要向创作和演出交响音乐《沙家浜》的革命同志们学习！我们要学习他们为工农兵服务，敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢革命的无产阶级革命精神。我们要坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化革命进行到底，我们要坚决贯彻毛主席的文艺路线，为创造无产阶级新的文艺而奋斗。我们要进一步地活学活用毛主席著作，以“老三篇”为座右铭，破私立公，在灵魂深处闹革命，彻底改造世界观，永远为全国人民，为世界人民服务！
