The Red Book of Revolution Illuminates the Hearts of the Tanzanian People
Many People Read and Apply "Quotations from Chairman Mao" Diligently Upon Receiving It

According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam: Since the publication of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in East Africa, the Tanzanian people have greatly cherished and loved this brilliant red book. Once someone gets it, they read it attentively and strive to apply it.

"This is a brilliant red book written by Chairman Mao!" Some Tanzanian friends, upon receiving the English version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," immediately shared this good news with their friends, letting others share in their joy. One day, a Tanzanian friend called a Chinese friend, saying he had something very important to discuss. It turned out that he had heard that "Quotations from Chairman Mao" had arrived and was afraid he wouldn't get a copy, so he called first. After getting the book, he couldn't put it down and started reading aloud immediately.

A Tanzanian journalist told a Xinhua reporter that he studies "Quotations from Chairman Mao" almost every night, especially the chapter on ideological cultivation. He said that following Chairman Mao's teachings, he conducts self-criticism and finds answers in "Quotations from Chairman Mao" when he encounters problems.

Another Tanzanian friend said, "Since I got Chairman Mao's red book, whenever I encounter problems I can't solve, I find answers in this book, and the problems are resolved." One Tanzanian friend was overjoyed after receiving a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He carefully placed this precious book in the left pocket of his shirt and then patted his pocket, telling his Chinese friend, "My heart is here. This red book is my heart!"

One evening, in a square in Dar es Salaam, a Chinese color documentary film "Chairman Mao and the Million-strong Cultural Revolution Army" was being shown. When the Chinese Red Guards on the screen loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations in Tiananmen Square, some Tanzanian youths who had read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" also recited aloud together.

After the movie, a Tanzanian youth leader held up "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high and showed the image of Chairman Mao on the book to the youths watching the movie. He told them that it was this great leader who wrote this red book.

    革命红书照亮坦桑尼亚人民的心
    许多人得到《毛主席语录》就认真阅读努力运用
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆电　自从《毛主席语录》发行到东非以来，坦桑尼亚人民十分珍视和热爱这本光辉的红书。一旦有谁得到它，就手不释卷，认真地阅读并努力加以运用。
    这是“一本毛主席写的杰出的红书！”一些坦桑尼亚朋友在得到英文版的《毛主席语录》后，立刻把这个好消息告诉他们的朋友，让别人分享他们的喜悦。有一天，一位坦桑尼亚朋友打电话给中国朋友，说他有一件非常要紧的事要同中国朋友谈谈。原来是他听说《毛主席语录》来了后，生怕没挨上号，所以先打电话来。当书到手后，他爱不释手，立即放声朗读起来。
    一位坦桑尼亚新闻工作者对新华社记者说，他几乎天天晚上都学习《毛主席语录》，特别是关于思想意识修养的一章。他说，他根据毛主席的教导，进行自我批评，有了问题，就从《毛主席语录》中寻找答案。
    另一位坦桑尼亚朋友说：“自从我得到了毛主席的红书，只要碰到不能解决的问题，我就从这本书里寻找答案，这些问题便迎刃而解了。”有一位坦桑尼亚朋友在得到了一本《毛主席语录》后高兴极了。他把这本宝书小心翼翼地放在衬衣左边的口袋里，然后用手抚摩着口袋对中国朋友说：“我的心就在这儿。这本红彤彤的书就是我的心！”
    有一天晚上，在达累斯萨拉姆的一个街头广场上，正在放映中国彩色纪录影片《毛主席和百万文化革命大军在一起》。当银幕上的中国红卫兵在天安门广场上大声朗读毛主席语录时，一些读过《毛主席语录》的坦桑尼亚青年也随着高声朗读起来。
    看完电影后，一位坦桑尼亚青年领袖高高举起《毛主席语录》，把书上的毛主席像给看电影的青年看，并且告诉他们说，就是在银幕上出现的这位伟大领袖写了这本红书。
