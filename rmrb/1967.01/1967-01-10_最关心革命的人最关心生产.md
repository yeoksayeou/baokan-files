Title: Those Who Care Most About the Revolution Care Most About Production

We firmly support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebel workers in Shanghai.

We revolutionary workers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and must, on the premise of doing a good job in the Cultural Revolution, actively promote production. However, those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line do the opposite. They incite some workers to leave their production posts, attempting to achieve their goal of sabotaging production and the Cultural Revolution.

Who cares most about the revolution? Who cares most about production? Only those who care most about the revolution are the ones who care most about production. Those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly carry out the bourgeois reactionary line shout "grasp the revolution, promote production," but in reality, they are the culprits who sabotage the revolution and production. Take our Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory as an example. In the early stages of the movement, those who adhered to the bourgeois reactionary line used the excuse of "promoting production" to suppress the revolution. In early November, students from Beijing Institute of Aeronautics came to our factory for revolutionary connections, and these guys were terrified. They incited workers who did not understand the truth to go on strike and attack the revolutionary students. Ironclad facts exposed these guys' true intentions: promoting production was a cover, and their real goal was to preserve their positions and the old bourgeois order. We must expose the true faces of these reactionaries, drag them out, and fight them to the end.

We revolutionary workers resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution, promote production." We arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, sharpen our eyes, distinguish right from wrong, and resolutely smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. We will carry the Cultural Revolution to the end and will not retreat until we achieve complete victory!

    最关心革命的人最关心生产
    北京光华木材厂工人　耿锡五　魏秀和
    我们坚决支持上海革命造反派工人的革命行动。
    我们革命工人最听毛主席的话，一定要在搞好文化大革命的前提下，积极搞好生产。可是，那些顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，却反其道而行之。他们挑动一部分工人离开生产岗位，企图达到他们破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的目的。
    是谁最关心革命，是谁最关心生产呢？只有最关心革命的人，才是最关心生产的人。那些党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的家伙们嘴里也喊“抓革命，促生产”，实际却是破坏革命，破坏生产的罪魁祸首。拿我们光华木材厂来说，运动初期，那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，借口“抓生产”来压制革命。十一月初，北京航空学院的同学来我们厂进行革命串连，这些家伙害怕得要死，竟然挑动不明真相的工人罢工来围攻革命学生。铁的事实戳穿了这些家伙抓生产是假，反革命是实。他们的真正目的无非是保他们的官，是保他们资产阶级旧秩序。我们一定要把这些反动家伙的真面目戳穿，把他们揪出来，斗倒斗臭。
    我们革命工人坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，擦亮眼睛，明辨是非，坚决粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！
