	Leftists Unite, Seize Power, and Change the Heavens
	Shanghai Municipal Higher Education Red Guards Revolutionary Committee

	Chairman Mao has issued a solemn call: the revolutionary masses of the proletariat must unite and seize the power from the capitalist roaders!

	Upon hearing this exhilarating news, our blood boils, we jump for joy, and we feel an unprecedented sense of satisfaction! We cannot help but shout a thousand times: Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!

	With Chairman Mao's command, we revolutionary rebels are enthusiastic and united, with thousands of cannonades, launching a life-and-death struggle to seize power from the capitalist roaders within the party. Our slogan is to seize power! Our resolve is to seize power! All our actions boil down to one point: seize power! Seize power!! Seize power!!!

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has reached a new turning point, and class struggle is unfolding nationwide. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat must unite and seize all power from the capitalist roaders! This is the first time in human history, a great innovation in the international communist movement, and a historic event of epoch-making significance to ensure the realization of communism in our country and the world! We raise our hands to welcome it!

	We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, the defenders of the dictatorship of the proletariat. To seize power for the proletariat, to seize power for Chairman Mao, this is our duty! We rebel for the sake of seizing power, we struggle for the sake of seizing power, we shed blood for the sake of seizing power, and we are not afraid of sacrifice. Because we firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. Throughout history, countless slave rebellions and peasant uprisings have been for the sake of seizing power, but they have not truly succeeded. Since the advent of Marxism, under the leadership of the great Lenin, the proletarian revolutionaries in the Soviet Union united for the first time and truly seized power, but it was then seized back by the revisionists. Chairman Mao led our forefathers, fighting bravely and unyieldingly, to finally establish the red power of the whole of China. But since liberation, the big and small Khrushchevs hidden in China, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, have never forgotten to seize power from us. In fact, in many departments and units, power has already been seized by them, and they are imposing bourgeois dictatorship on us! The thousand and one principles of Marxism all boil down to one sentence: "Rebellion is justified." Seizing power is justified! Can we not seize the rights held by imperialists and revisionists? Can we not seize the party, government, and financial powers held by the capitalist roaders? A thousand times no! Chairman Mao teaches us: "The world is ours. The country is ours. Society is ours. If we do not say it, who will? If we do not do it, who will?" The power is ours. If we do not seize it, who will? If we do not hold it, who will? We must seize power! We must hold power! The laws of historical development determine that the proletariat will hold power. We not only want to achieve the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries in China to seize the power from the capitalist roaders, but we also want to achieve the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries worldwide to seize the power from all imperialists, revisionists, and capitalists! To those bastards who try to hold back the wheels of history, roll your eggs away, the world is ours!

	Seizing power is a great showdown between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and it will inevitably encounter tenfold frenzied resistance from the class enemies. An unprecedented class struggle and a storm of unprecedented scale have appeared before us, this is a severe test for us Red Guards. If you are a hero, if you are a man, you must dare to struggle, dare to seize power, dare to charge into battle, and dare to face fire and water! For the sake of defending the dictatorship of the proletariat, for the sake of defending Chairman Mao's red power, even if we lose our heads, we are willing! Shanghai is the stronghold of the bourgeoisie, the place where capitalist forces are most stubborn, we must seize their power, and they will inevitably rally all decayed forces, ghosts and snakes, flies and mosquitoes, to counterattack us. We Red Guard soldiers must be prepared to strike back at all revengeful actions of the class enemies. Chairman Mao said: "To struggle is to have sacrifices." To seize power, there will inevitably be bloody struggles. We are always ready to use our blood and heads for the proletariat to seize power. In the struggle to seize power, if we sacrifice, it is our glory. If we do not seize power, we will die with regret; if we seize power, we will die with satisfaction. We firmly believe that as long as we seize power, even if there is no longer us in the world, communism will certainly be realized in China and in the world!

	To seize power, we must definitely achieve the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries. All of us Red Guard soldiers must unite with the workers' movement and the peasants' movement, unite all revolutionary rebels in the city, and seize all the big and small powers usurped by the capitalist roaders from the bottom up! Until the old Shanghai is thoroughly smashed, and the new Shanghai stands firm. Seize power and change the heavens! But our alliance can only be the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries, not a compromise, reconciliation, and great mix. We must be especially vigilant against those who, under the banner of revolutionary rebels, engage in pro-royalist activities to disrupt our ranks and seize power from the proletariat!

	With the development of the struggle situation, the class enemies have changed their counter-revolutionary strategies. The capitalist roaders and their running dogs—the die-hard pro-royalists, under the relentless pursuit and attacks of the revolutionary rebels, have been silent for a while and suddenly shouted "rebellion." They wave the banner of "revolutionary rebellion," shout extreme "revolutionary" words, deceive and numb part of the masses, secretly seize the party, government, and financial powers of some units, and attempt to preserve their strength, resist to the end, and survive for the future. This is stubborn and resisting the tide of history. We must expose them in time, overthrow them, and seize all their big and small powers! There are also some die-hard pro-royalist elements under the command of the capitalist roaders. After shouting "rebellion," they sharpen their heads, tuck their tails, and sneak into the ranks of revolutionary rebels. They use the disagreements within the revolutionary rebels to spread rumors, sow discord, expand contradictions, create splits, shift the target of struggle, and direct the spearhead at the proletarian headquarters. Some of them also cater to the sectarian sentiments and the need for individual heroism within the revolutionary rebel ranks, flatter some, attack others, reverse black and white, confuse right and wrong, incite the masses, and seize power from the proletariat. These are new forms of rightist rebellion, and we must smash and eliminate them all!

	We only unite with the true revolutionary rebels, and we will not compromise with reformism, centrism, sectarianism, and mountainism!

	We firmly support the struggle to seize power by all revolutionary rebels, and we firmly suppress all rightist rebellions!

	Only revolutionary rebels can seize power, and rightists cannot rebel!

	If the enemy does not surrender, we will annihilate it!

	An unprecedented storm is coming! The most magnificent day for us revolutionary rebels has arrived! All Red Guard soldiers, act quickly, go into the storm to fight, to kill, to temper!

	Let the storm of revolutionary seizure of power be more violent! After the storm, what will appear before us is a new world shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought!

　　左派大联合　夺权换新天
　　红卫兵上海市大专院校革命委员会
    毛主席发出了庄严号召，无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权！
    听到这个激动人心的好消息，我们热血沸腾，我们狂欢跳跃，我们感到前所未有的痛快！我们禁不住千万次地高呼：无产阶级专政万岁！毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席一声令下，我们革命造反派千军踊跃，万炮齐鸣，向党内走资本主义道路的当权派展开了你死我活的夺权斗争。我们的口号是夺权！我们的决心是夺权！我们的一切行动归结到一点就是夺权！夺权！！夺权！！！
    无产阶级文化大革命发展到了一个新的转折点，全国全面的阶级斗争展开了。无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的一切权！这是人类历史上的第一次，是国际共产主义运动中极其伟大的创举，是保证共产主义在我国和全世界实现的具有划时代意义的大事！我们举起双手欢迎它！
    我们是毛主席的红小兵，我们是无产阶级专政的捍卫者，为无产阶级夺权，为毛主席夺权，这是我们的天职！我们为夺权而造反，为夺权而斗争，为夺权而流血，为夺权而不怕牺牲。因为我们牢记着毛主席的伟大教导，革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权就有一切，没有政权就失去了一切。历史上千百万次的奴隶起义、农民起义，为的就是夺权，但没有真正实现。自从有了马克思主义，在伟大列宁的领导下，苏联的无产阶级革命派大联合，破天荒第一次真正夺得了权，但又被修正主义者夺了回去。毛主席领着我们的父兄，前仆后继，南征北战，终于建立了全中国的红色政权。但解放后十几年来，隐藏在中国的大小赫鲁晓夫打着“红旗”反红旗，一刻也没忘记向我们夺权。事实上，许多部门，许多单位，权已被他们夺了去，他们向我们搞资产阶级专政！马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：“造反有理。”夺权有理！被帝国主义、修正主义把持的一切权利，我们不夺能行吗？被走资本主义道路当权派把持的一切党、政、财权不夺能行吗？一千个一万个不行！毛主席教导我们：“天下者我们的天下。国家者我们的国家。社会者我们的社会。我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？”政权者我们的政权。我们不夺谁夺？我们不掌谁掌？我们就是要夺权！就是要掌政！历史发展的规律，注定了由无产阶级来掌权。我们不但要在中国实行无产阶级革命派大联合，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权，我们还要在全世界实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，夺一切帝国主义、修正主义、资本主义的权！妄想拖住历史车轮倒退的混蛋们，统统滚他妈的蛋吧，世界是我们的！
    夺权是一场无产阶级和资产阶级的大决战，必然会遇到阶级敌人十倍疯狂的反抗。一场前所未有的阶级大搏斗，一场空前规模的急风暴雨，已出现在我们面前，这是对我们红卫兵战士的一次严峻考验。是英雄，是好汉，就要敢于斗争，敢于夺权，敢于冲锋陷阵，敢于赴汤蹈火！为了保卫无产阶级专政，为了保卫毛主席的红色政权，就是丢了脑袋，我们也心甘情愿！上海是资产阶级的老巢，是资本主义势力最顽固的地方，我们要夺他们的权，他们必然会纠合一切腐朽力量、牛鬼蛇神、苍蝇蚊子，一起向我们反扑。我们红卫兵战士要做好准备，迎头痛击阶级敌人的一切报复行为。毛主席说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲”。要夺权，必然会有流血斗争。我们时刻准备着用自己的热血和头颅为无产阶级夺权。在夺权斗争中牺牲了，这是我们的光荣。权夺不过来，我们死不瞑目；权夺过来了，我们死而后已。我们坚信：只要权夺过来了，即使世界上没有了我们，共产主义也必将在中国、在世界实现！
    要夺权，一定要实现无产阶级革命派的大联合。我们全体红卫兵战士一定要与工人运动、农民运动相结合，联合全市革命造反派，把被走资本主义道路的当权派窃取的一切大权、小权，自下而上统统夺过来！直到把旧上海彻底砸烂，新上海巍然屹立。夺权换新天！但我们的联合，只能是无产阶级革命派的大联合，而不是折衷、调和的大混合。我们要特别警惕那些打着革命造反派旗号，干着保皇勾当的坏家伙来捣乱我们的阵线，向无产阶级夺权！
    随着斗争形势的发展，阶级敌人已经改变了他们反革命的策略。走资本主义道路的当权派和他们的走狗——铁杆保皇派，在革命造反派的穷追猛打之下，沉默了一阵以后，突然大叫“造反”。他们打着“革命造反”的旗号，叫着过激的“革命”言词，蒙蔽、麻痹了部分群众，偷偷摸摸地夺走了一些单位的党、政、财权，妄图保存实力，负隅顽抗，以利将来的生存。这是顽固不化，这是抗拒历史潮流。我们必须及时戳穿他们，打倒他们，把他们保留的一切大权小权统统夺过来！还有一些受走资本主义道路当权派指使的铁杆保皇分子，他们大叫一通“造反”之后，削尖了脑袋，夹住了尾巴，混进了革命造反派队伍。他们利用革命造反派内部的意见分歧，造谣生事，挑拨离间，扩大矛盾，制造分裂，转移斗争目标，把攻击的矛头指向无产阶级司令部。他们有的还迎合革命造反派队伍中个别人的宗派情绪、风头主义的需要，吹捧一部分人，打击一部分人，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，煽动群众，向无产阶级夺权。这都是右派翻天的新形式，我们一定要统统打垮它，消灭它！
    我们只和真正的革命造反派大联合，绝不和改良主义、折衷主义、宗派主义、山头主义搞调和！
    我们坚决支持一切革命造反派的夺权斗争，我们坚决镇压一切右派的翻天行动！
    只许革命造反派夺权，不准右派翻天！
    敌人不投降，就叫它灭亡！
    一场空前未有的急风暴雨来临了！我们革命造反派最盛大的节日到来了！我们全体红卫兵战士火速行动起来，到暴风雨中去搏斗，去厮杀，去锻炼！
    让革命夺权的暴风雨来得更猛烈些吧！暴风雨过后，展现在我们面前的将是一个处处闪烁着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的新世界！
