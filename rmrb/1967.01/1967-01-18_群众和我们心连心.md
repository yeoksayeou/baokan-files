Recently, our platoon received a letter and three jiao (three-tenths of a yuan) from the Liuzhuang Production Brigade Party Branch. The letter said: “Your platoon has a soldier who, while passing through our village on a field exercise, drank some water and left three jiao under a cracked bowl, along with a note of apology. Your actions, which consciously adhere to the ‘Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention,’ have deeply moved us. However, we cannot accept the money because the bowl was not damaged by you; it was already cracked.”

Here is what happened: Recently, our platoon passed through the Liuzhuang Production Brigade on a field exercise. As soon as the villagers saw us, they hurriedly brought us hot water. Communicator Zhang Hong accidentally dropped a bowl into the grass. When he picked it up, he noticed a crack inside. He thought, “This crack might have been caused by me just now.” Remembering Chairman Mao’s instruction in the “Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention” about compensating for damaged items, he didn’t bother to examine it closely. He took three jiao from his pocket and quietly placed it under the bowl.

The villager who brought the water discovered the money under the bowl and handed it over to the Production Brigade Party Branch, along with a warm letter of thanks.

This small incident illustrates a big principle. Although this is a small matter, it fully demonstrates that maintaining discipline is the duty of every revolutionary soldier. Only by being meticulous and strict with oneself can one strictly follow the disciplines, and only then will the people truly love us from the bottom of their hearts and unite with us.

    群众和我们心连心
    副指导员　刘戍辰
    不久前，我们连收到刘庄大队党支部寄来的三角钱和一封感谢信。信中说：“……你连有一位战士野营路过我村时，喝了开水，把三角钱悄悄地压在一只裂缝的碗底下，并留了一张道歉的条子。你们这种自觉地遵守‘三大纪律八项注意’的行动，使我们深受感动。但是，钱我们不能收，因为那只碗不是你们损坏的，而是原先就坏了。”
    事情的经过是这样的：不久前，我们连野营路过刘庄大队，村里的社员一见我们来了，就急忙地送来了开水。通讯员张洪有一不留神，把碗掉在草丛里了。他拾起一看，里面有道裂缝。他想：“这道裂缝说不定是我刚才摔的。”他想起毛主席在“三大纪律八项注意”中有一条“损坏东西要赔”的教导，顾不得细看，就从口袋里掏了三角钱，悄悄地压在碗底下。
    送水的老乡发现碗底的钱后，就把钱交给了大队党支部，并写了一封热情洋溢的感谢信。
    小事情反映了大道理。这个事情虽小，却充分说明了自觉维护纪律是每个革命战士的本份。只有一丝不苟、严格要求自己，执行纪律才能不折不扣，人民群众才能从心里热爱我们，和我们心连心。
