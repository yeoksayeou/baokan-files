In the Chenjiaya Brigade of Hongyang Commune, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, a group of instructors for studying Chairman Mao's works has been trained. Where there are people learning, there are people guiding. The sound of reciting Chairman Mao's quotations can be heard everywhere in the village. The more the masses study, the more they love to study, creating a new situation of learning and applying quotations, which promotes the thought revolution of the people.

The instructors of this brigade lead by example in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Thus, they have their own experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and their methods of guiding the masses to study become more lively and targeted. For those who are illiterate and elderly, they deliver targeted quotations door-to-door and patiently explain them one by one. Once the recipient learns one, they replace it with another. For literate young people, they select key articles and organize them to study and apply repeatedly, and advocate for hard work in the use of words. Mei Wen, a 61-year-old poor peasant, has poor eyesight. The instructor reads the relevant quotations from the "Three Articles" to him. After learning the quotation "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and is working thoroughly for the people's interests," Mei Wen actively cares for the collective and voluntarily digs soil for the feeding room. Young Chen Yucai does not want to work as a caretaker. With the help of the instructor, after studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he actively cares about the brigade's work and works more enthusiastically.

Many commune members, with the help of instructors, actively study the "Three Articles" and "Opposing Liberalism," breaking private interests for public interests, and their spiritual outlook has undergone profound changes. The political atmosphere is becoming thicker, and good deeds are increasing. Some voluntarily clean the houses of the five-guarantee households, wash clothes and bedding; some voluntarily clean the streets and public toilets. During the drought, female commune members get up at dawn and sleep at midnight, carrying water and planting corn like male commune members, without complaining, without getting tired, without arguing over work points, and the more they work, the more enthusiastic they become.

专栏：大学毛主席著作  大立毛泽东思想

    哪里有人学习哪里有人辅导
    陕西省长安县红阳公社陈家崖大队，培养了一批学习毛主席著作的辅导员。哪里有人学习，哪里就有人辅导。全村到处可以听到朗诵毛主席语录的声音。群众越学越爱学，出现了学语录、用语录的新局面，促进了人的思想革命化。
    这个大队的学习辅导员，学在前面，用在前面。这样，自己有了活学活用毛主席著作的体会，在辅导群众学习的时候，方法就越来越活，针对性越来越强。他们对不识字的和老年人，送有针对性的语录上门，耐心地逐条讲解；等对方学会一条，再换一条。对识字的青年人，就选择重点文章，组织他们反复学、反复用，并且提倡在用字上狠下功夫。六十一岁的贫农美文成年老眼花。辅导员就把“老三篇”中有关语录念给他听。美文成学了“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”这条语录后，主动地关心集体，义务给饲养室挖土。青年陈玉才，不愿干保管。在辅导员帮助下学了《为人民服务》以后，他主动关心队上的工作，劳动更积极了。
    许多社员在辅导员帮助下，学习“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》后，积极破私立公，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，政治空气越来越浓，好人好事不断增多。有的主动给五保户打扫屋子，拆洗衣服、被子；有的主动打扫街道和公共厕所。在抗旱时，女社员起五更、睡半夜，和男社员一样担水点种包谷，不叫苦，不喊累，不争工分，越干越起劲。
