Four revolutionary rebel organizations in Heilongjiang Province issued an urgent appeal to all revolutionary peasants in the province. They called for the rural revolutionary factions to unite and thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism. They must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," resolutely seize power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and resolutely expose the evil plots of class enemies who use economism as bait to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the socialist economic foundation of the countryside. They must drag out those who are behind the scenes and in front of the scenes, fight them down, and stink them up, and implement proletarian dictatorship.

Editor's Note: Four revolutionary organizations in Heilongjiang Province jointly issued an appeal, calling on rural revolutionary factions to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," oppose counter-revolutionary economism, and strike back against the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. This is an important document. The opinions they put forward are not only applicable to the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province but also to the vast rural areas of the country.

A historically unprecedented great peasant movement is surging across the vast rural areas of the country. This is a great revolution. The peasants are rising up to rebel against capitalism, against revisionism, against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and to seize power from the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This will play an extremely important role in developing the socialist economy, strengthening the alliance between workers and peasants, and further consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Class enemies will not readily accept their defeat. They are taking advantage of the year-end distribution to continue playing the trick of economism, using vile methods such as keeping less and distributing more, distributing public accumulation funds, distributing seed grain, and using reserve grain, to sabotage the collective economy, sabotage production, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must emphasize politics, consider the overall situation, and smash the plots and tricks of class enemies. Those who are engaged in sabotage both in front of and behind the scenes must be dragged out, fought down, and stunk up, and proletarian dictatorship must be implemented against them.

All proletarian revolutionary factions in the countryside, all revolutionary peasants, revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres must unite, grasp revolution, promote production, overthrow counter-revolutionary economism, seize power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road, and welcome the new high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our countryside!

New China News Agency, Harbin, January 26th: Four revolutionary rebel organizations in Heilongjiang Province issued an urgent appeal on January 20th to all revolutionary peasants in the province, calling on them to take action and thoroughly smash counter-revolutionary economism.

The four organizations are: the Mao Zedong Thought Combat Team of Baiqian County United Commune, the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards Never Give Up Combat Team of Baiqian No. 1 Middle School, the Sixth Brigade of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Red Rebel Corps of Harbin, and the Liaison Station of the Revolutionary Rebel Corps of Fuxin Coal Mine Institute in Baiqian. The Heilongjiang Daily published their appeal on the 23rd and also published an editorial, hailing their revolutionary action as an important sign that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Heilongjiang Province are actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It is a heavy blow to counter-revolutionary economism and the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. The editorial calls on revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants to unite, and all red rebels to unite, to overthrow counter-revolutionary economism! Seize power from those in power who are taking the capitalist road!

The four organizations' "Thoroughly Smash Economism - Urgent Appeal to All Revolutionary Peasants in the Province" states: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will certainly be victorious, whether it is early or late."

Currently, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing with tremendous force, like thunder and lightning, like a storm, and extraordinarily rapidly. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionary rebels have organized and united, forming a vast army of proletarian cultural revolution, and launched a comprehensive struggle for power. The capitalist reactionary line is collapsing and crumbling. In the stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have raised the banner of "rebellion is justified" and risen up to rebel. They are launching a comprehensive offensive against the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the countryside and against those who stubbornly adhere to the capitalist reactionary line, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside is entering a new high tide.

The appeal says, in the countryside, the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the capitalist reactionary line, collude with landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and conspire together, suppressing the revolutionary peasants from rebelling and striking down the revolutionary rebels. When their disguises are torn off and their plots are thoroughly foiled, they pick up the broken flag of economism, deceive the masses, incite the masses, privately distribute reserve grain, privately distribute public accumulation, and privately distribute next year's production costs, using economism as bait, attempting to lead a serious political struggle onto the wrong path of economism, create chaos, instigate armed struggles, divert the direction of the struggle, sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sabotage the socialist economic foundation of our countryside, and sabotage the expansion of production in the countryside, in an attempt to achieve the restoration of capitalism.

The appeal says: Comrades of the rural revolutionary rebels, we must take active action, expose all the plots and tricks of class enemies, resolutely oppose economism, and strike back against the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. To make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside better, we issue an urgent appeal to all revolutionary rebels in the rural areas of the province:

1. Rural revolutionary rebels must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," strive to become model implementers of grasping revolution and promoting production, and earnestly carry out the "Sixteen Articles" and relevant instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, vowing to achieve a double harvest of revolution and production.

2. Currently, in the countryside, a handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road use the tactics of throwing down their responsibilities and stopping production to threaten the revolutionary factions, sabotage production, and sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This has caused the production leadership of some communes and brigades to fall into a state of paralysis, seriously affecting the arrangement of rural production. We revolutionary rebels must resolutely seize back the leadership of revolution and production, shoulder the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production. We must promptly expose the plots and tricks of class enemies and prevent their plots from succeeding!

3. During the autumn harvest distribution, all communes and brigades must follow the distribution system stipulated by the state for the current year, and it is not allowed to keep less and distribute more. It is not allowed to include the public accumulation funds and other production costs for next year's expanded reproduction in the distribution to commune members for the current year. It is not allowed to arbitrarily use the stored grain for war preparedness and agricultural basic construction, nor is it allowed to arbitrarily change the accounting unit, expanding or reducing the production team. If there are places where grain is used, the reasons must be explained to the masses, the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual must be clarified, the long-term interests must be recognized, and they must be mobilized to voluntarily return the grain. Those who incite the masses to privately distribute grain in front of or behind the scenes must be dragged out, fought down, and stunk up, and proletarian dictatorship must be implemented against them.

4. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, no one is allowed to use the development of the economy as an excuse to arbitrarily sell part of the livestock and feed, secretly distribute everything, and make it impossible for next year's production to proceed normally, sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. Revolutionary rebel comrades must be vigilant, prevent thieves, protect production tools, and raise livestock well to prepare for next year's production.

5. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, no one is allowed to use the development of the collective economy and increasing the income of commune members as an excuse to cause a large number of people, vehicles, and horses to flow out, sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and spring plowing production work.

6. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" must be strictly implemented. It is necessary to prevent those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the capitalist reactionary line from inciting backward masses to arbitrarily leave their work positions, falsely record work points, and issue allowances. If there are those who incite the masses to go out in large numbers to make connections and issue allowances for going out to make connections, they should be dealt with as saboteurs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The issued funds should be recovered by the issuers.

7. It is necessary to prevent those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the capitalist reactionary line from using the state's money and the collective economy's money to issue allowances under the pretext of caring for the poor, in order to buy people's hearts, undermine the fighting spirit of the revolutionary factions, divert the direction of the struggle, and sneak through.

8. It is necessary to prevent those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the capitalist reactionary line from playing tricks and shooting dark arrows, creating chaos among the masses, forming factions, instigating armed struggles, protecting themselves, and passing through.

9. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when encountering the problem of the Four Clean-ups review, it is necessary to be vigilant and prevent those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the capitalist reactionary line from gathering ghosts and snakes, colluding with each other, taking the opportunity to reverse cases, counterattack, and launch a counterattack against the poor and lower-middle peasants. If there are those who are found to be counterattacking, they must be seriously dealt with and resolutely suppressed.

Those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who have not been reformed will inevitably take the opportunity of the cultural revolution to stir up trouble and engage in counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Revolutionary rebels must seriously supervise and reform them, be vigilant, allow them to be honest, and not allow them to make trouble. If they dare to move, they must be punished according to law immediately.

10. Revolutionary students and revolutionary cadres must take action, organize and plan to go to the countryside, combine with the peasant movement, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, strike back against various new counterattacks of the capitalist reactionary line, drag out those in power who are taking the capitalist road, fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, uproot the roots of revisionism, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high over the land of the people's communes in the countryside.

    黑龙江省四个革命造反组织向全省革命农民发出紧急呼吁
　　农村革命派联合起来彻底粉碎反革命经济主义
    坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，坚决夺走资本主义道路的当权派的权，坚决揭穿阶级敌人以经济主义为诱饵，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏农村社会主义经济基础的罪恶阴谋，并把那些幕前幕后人物揪出来，斗倒斗臭，实行无产阶级专政。
    编者按：黑龙江省的四个革命组织，联合发表呼吁书，号召农村的革命派，坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，反对反革命经济主义，击退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。这是一个很重要的文件。他们提出的意见，不但适用于黑龙江省农村，同样也适用于全国广大农村。
    一个历史上空前伟大的农民运动正在全国广大农村汹涌澎湃地发动起来，这是一个伟大的革命。农民起来造资本主义的反，造修正主义的反，造地、富、反、坏、右的反，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。这对于发展社会主义经济，加强工农联盟，进一步巩固无产阶级专政，将起极其重大的作用。
    阶级敌人是不会甘心他们的失败的。他们正在趁年终分配之机，继续玩弄经济主义的阴谋，采用少留多分、分掉公积金、分掉种籽粮、动用准备粮等卑劣手法，破坏集体经济，破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。我们一定要突出政治，顾全大局，粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。对于那些在幕前幕后进行阴谋破坏的坏家伙，一定要把他们揪出来，斗倒，斗臭，对他们实行无产阶级专政。
    农村的一切无产阶级革命派联合起来，一切革命的农民同革命的工人、革命的学生、革命的知识分子、革命的干部联合起来，抓革命，促生产，打倒反革命经济主义，夺走资本主义道路的当权派的权，迎接我国农村无产阶级文化大革命的新高潮！
    新华社哈尔滨二十六日电　黑龙江省的四个革命造反组织在一月二十日向全省革命农民发出紧急呼吁，呼吁全省革命农民行动起来，彻底粉碎反革命的经济主义。
    这四个革命组织是：拜泉县团结公社毛泽东思想战斗团，拜泉一中毛泽东思想红卫兵反到底战斗团，哈尔滨红色造反团毛泽东思想宣传团第六分队，阜新煤矿学院革命造反团驻拜泉联络站。《黑龙江日报》二十三日登载了他们的呼吁书，并发表了社论，欢呼他们的这一革命行动是黑龙江省广大贫下中农高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极投入无产阶级文化大革命的一个重要标志。它对反革命经济主义、资产阶级反动路线的新反扑是一个沉重的打击。社论号召革命的贫下中农联合起来，全体红色造反者联合起来，打倒反革命经济主义！夺走资本主义道路当权派的权！
    四个组织发出的《彻底粉碎经济主义——向全省革命农民紧急呼吁》中说：毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    目前，无产阶级文化大革命，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，正以雷霆万钧之力，排山倒海之势，迅猛异常地向前发展着。无产阶级革命造反派在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，组织起来，联合起来，结成了浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，展开了全面的夺权斗争。资产阶级反动路线，正在土崩瓦解，全线崩溃。在无产阶级文化大革命的疾风暴雨中，广大贫下中农高举起“造反有理”的大旗起来造反了，他们正在向农村中党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙，发动全面的总攻击，农村无产阶级文化大革命出现了新高潮。
    呼吁书说，农村中，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，和地、富、反、坏、右分子互相勾结，狼狈为奸，压制革命农民起来造反，打击革命造反派。在他们的画皮被揭穿，阴谋遭到彻底破产的时候，他们又拣起经济主义这面破旗，欺骗群众，煽动群众，私分储备粮，私分公共积累，私分下年生产费等，利用经济主义为诱饵，企图把一场严肃的政治斗争引向经济主义的邪路，制造混乱，挑起武斗，转移斗争的大方向，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏我国农村的社会主义经济基础，破坏农村扩大再生产，妄图实现资本主义复辟。
    呼吁书说：农村革命造反派同志们，我们要积极行动起来，揭穿一切阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，坚决反对经济主义，击退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。为把农村无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，我们向全省农村革命造反派发出紧急呼吁：
    一、农村中的革命造反派，必须坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，努力成为抓革命，促生产的模范执行者，认真贯彻执行十六条和中共中央有关指示，誓夺革命生产双丰收。
    二、目前，农村中，一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派用撂挑子、停生产的手段，威胁革命派，破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。致使一些社队的生产领导班子陷于瘫痪状态，严重地影响了农村生产的安排。我们革命造反派要坚决夺回革命和生产的领导权，挑起革命和生产的重担。对于阶级敌人的这一阴谋诡计，必须及时揭穿，使其阴谋不能得逞！
    三、各社队在秋收分配过程中，必须按照国家规定的当年分配制度办事，不准少留多分。不准把来年扩大再生产用的公积金及其他生产费用纳入社员当年年终分配。不准随便动用库存的备战备荒用粮和农田基本建设用粮，不准随意改变核算单位，把生产队扩大或缩小。如有动用的地方应和群众讲明道理，摆正国家、集体和个人三者关系，认清长远利益，动员他们主动送回。对于那些在幕前或幕后挑动群众私分者，必须把他们揪出来，斗倒斗臭，实行无产阶级专政。
    四、在文化大革命期间，不准任何人以发展经济为名，把部分牲畜及饲料随便卖掉，偷偷分光，使来年生产不能正常进行，破坏无产阶级文化大革命和破坏生产。革命造反派同志们要提高警惕，严防扒手，保护好生产用具，喂养好牲畜，为来年的生产作好物质准备。
    五、在文化大革命中，不准任何人以搞副业、发展集体经济和增加社员收入为名，使大量人、车、马外流，破坏无产阶级文化大革命和备耕生产工作。
    六、在文化大革命中必须严格贯彻“各尽所能，按劳分配”的社会主义分配原则。严防党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，煽动落后群众，擅自离开工作岗位，虚记工分，乱发补助。如有煽动群众大量外出串连，滥发外出串连补助费者，以破坏无产阶级文化大革命论处。所发款项由签发者负责追回。
    七、严防走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，慷国家之慨，慷集体经济之慨，以照顾困难户等为幌子，滥发补助，借以收买人心，瓦解革命派的斗志，转移斗争大方向，蒙混过关。
    八、严防走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，耍阴谋、放暗箭，在群众中制造混乱，拉一伙，打一伙，利用和扩大群众中的人民内部矛盾，制造宗派，挑起武斗，保护自己过关。
    九、在文化大革命中碰到四清复查问题时，必须提高警惕，严防党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，网罗牛鬼蛇神，互相勾结，趁机翻案，反攻倒算，向贫下中农进行反扑。如有发现反攻倒算者，必须严肃处理，坚决镇压。
    没有改造好的地、富、反、坏分子，必然要趁文化革命之机，兴风作浪，进行反革命复辟活动。革命造反派一定要认真监督和改造他们，提高警惕，只许他们老老实实，不许他们乱说乱动，如有胆敢蠢蠢欲动者，立即依法惩办。
    十、革命学生、革命干部要积极行动起来，有组织、有计划地到农村中去，同农民运动相结合，向贫下中农学习，和贫下中农一道击退形形色色的资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，揪出走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，和贫下中农一道挖掉修正主义根子，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远高高飘扬在农村人民公社的土地上。
