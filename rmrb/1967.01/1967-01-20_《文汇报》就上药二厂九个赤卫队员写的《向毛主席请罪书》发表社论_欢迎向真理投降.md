The Wenhui Daily published a commentary on the letter of repentance to Chairman Mao written by nine Red Guards from Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory No. 2 and posted in front of the People's Daily office in Beijing. The commentary is titled "Welcome to Surrender to the Truth."

New China News Agency, Shanghai, January 19th - The January 15th issue of the Wenhui Daily published a letter of repentance to Chairman Mao written by nine Red Guards from Shanghai Pharmaceutical Factory No. 2 and posted in front of the People's Daily office in Beijing. The newspaper also published a commentary titled "Welcome to Surrender to the Truth."

The full text of the Wenhui Daily's commentary is as follows:

A group of Red Guards attacked the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the important editorial note of the People's Daily. This is a public opposition to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, a crime against the people and Chairman Mao. Now, they have posted a big-character poster titled "Letter of Repentance to Chairman Mao," admitting their mistakes and willing to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We welcome this action.

The vast majority of Red Guards have been deceived and unknowingly became tools of the bourgeois reactionary line. Faced with facts and after education, they will awaken. For all comrades who sincerely return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we revolutionary rebels can overlook past mistakes and reunite with them.

All comrades who have been deceived must first have the courage to admit their mistakes, honestly surrender to the truth, and surrender to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. After awakening, all comrades who have been deceived must summarize the lessons of the previous stage, learn from them, and never repeat the same mistakes.

Recognizing mistakes is only the beginning of correction. True repentance must be proven by actions. From being deceived to recognizing mistakes is difficult, and from recognizing mistakes to truly rebelling is even more difficult. This is a change in stance, a change in the great direction. It indeed requires a painful struggle of thought, to get rid of all kinds of selfish and impure thoughts, to consciously revolutionize and consciously rebel in the depths of the soul.

Of course, there is a small group of diehards who, due to being deeply poisoned, remain stubbornly unenlightened, stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line, and create all kinds of trouble for the revolutionary rebels, doing their utmost to resist and sabotage Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. For this small group of diehards, first educate, then warn, and if ineffective, they must be dealt with as disruptors of the Cultural Revolution, and the proletarian dictatorship must be implemented against them. This is the conspiracy of the revolutionary rebels, and we publicly announce this, so do not say we did not warn you!

The full text of the "Letter of Repentance to Chairman Mao" is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

We repent to you, sir. We were wrong, completely wrong.

Yesterday, several comrades from our factory, under the deception of the Red Guards headquarters, accompanied by representatives from the Jiading District Liaison Station, went to the People's Daily to inquire about the situation regarding the People's Daily's reprinting of the Wenhui Daily's publication of the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" by the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and ten other revolutionary mass organizations. Due to being deceived by the extremely reactionary statement from the Red Guards headquarters that "the editorial note of the People's Daily has problems," we extremely wrongly believed that this article was not approved by you, sir, but was proposed by the editors of the People's Daily. Therefore, we wrote an extremely reactionary big-character poster titled "Indignant Accusation, Strong Protest," extremely wrongly protesting to the editors of the People's Daily. This is a grave criminal act.

Through the help of revolutionary masses from Beijing and other places, we saw the seriousness of our mistakes. We were deceived by bad people, fooled by bad people, and stood on the reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie, opposing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you, sir. We deeply detest our criminal acts and repent to you, sir.

The root cause of this serious mistake is that our thoughts have not been transformed, and thus we lost our direction in the great storms. We will definitely learn from this serious mistake, keep our eyes open, heighten our vigilance, and stand firmly on the proletarian stance.

We pledge to you, sir:

1. We will definitely read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will definitely, in the Cultural Revolution, eliminate bourgeois thoughts and establish proletarian thoughts, constantly transform ourselves, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and closely follow you, sir, in making the revolution.

2. Our coming to Beijing to accuse is completely wrong. We were deceived by the Red Guards headquarters. We will strongly rebel against the Red Guards headquarters and expose the masterminds behind the scenes.

3. We will definitely respond to your call to seize the revolution and promote production, immediately return to Shanghai, participate in the Cultural Revolution and production struggle in our units, and make up for the losses we caused to production by coming to Beijing!

Our hearts' red sun, Chairman Mao, long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!

    《文汇报》就上药二厂九个赤卫队员写的《向毛主席请罪书》发表社论
    欢迎向真理投降
    新华社上海十九日电　十五日的《文汇报》刊载了上海第二制药厂九个赤卫队员写的、张贴在北京《人民日报》社门前的一份《向毛主席请罪书》，并发表了《欢迎向真理投降》的社论。
    《文汇报》的社论全文如下：
    一批赤卫队员攻击《告上海全市人民书》，攻击《人民日报》的极其重要的编者按。这是公开地反对毛主席的革命路线，是对人民、对毛主席犯了罪的。现在，他们贴出《向毛主席请罪书》的大字报，承认了错误，愿意回到毛主席的革命路线上来。我们对这个行动表示欢迎。
    绝大多数的赤卫队员是受蒙蔽的，他们不自觉地充当了资产阶级反动路线的工具。在事实面前，经过教育，他们是会觉醒的。对于一切真心诚意回到毛主席的革命路线上来的同志，我们革命造反派可以不咎既往，同他们重新团结起来。
    凡是过去受蒙蔽的同志，首先要有勇气承认自己的错误，要老老实实地向真理投降，向毛主席的革命路线投降。一切受蒙蔽的同志觉悟过来以后，必须总结前一阶段的教训，引以为戒，从此再也不能重蹈覆辙了。
    认识错误，仅仅是改正的开始。真正的痛改前非，必须用自己的行动来证明。从受蒙蔽到认识错误固然不易，从认识错误到真正起来造反更不易。这是立场的转变，是大方向的转变。它确实需要经过一番痛苦的思想斗争，要去掉形形色色的私心杂念，要在灵魂深处自觉革命，自觉造反。
    当然也有一小撮顽固分子，他们由于受毒太深，始终执迷不悟，顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的立场，对革命造反派进行种种破坏捣乱，对毛主席的革命路线竭尽抵制、破坏之能事。对于这一小撮顽固分子，始而教育，再则警告，如若无效，就必须以破坏文化大革命论处，对他们实行无产阶级专政。这是革命造反派的阴谋，特此公开奉告，勿谓言之不预也！《向毛主席请罪书》全文如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们向您老人家请罪。我们是错了，完全的错了。
    昨天，我们上药二厂几个同志在赤卫队总部的蒙蔽下，随同嘉定地区联络站代表，到《人民日报》询问《人民日报》转载《文汇报》登载上海工人革命造反总司令部等十一个革命群众组织的《告上海全市人民书》的情况。由于我们受了赤卫队总部的“《人民日报》编者按有问题”这个极其反动言论的蒙蔽，极其错误地认为这篇文章未经您老人家批准，而是《人民日报》编者提出来的，因而写了一张极其反动的大字报——《愤怒的控诉，强烈的抗议》，极端错误地向《人民日报》的编者提出了抗议。这是个极大的犯罪行为。
    经过北京和外地革命群众的帮助，我们看到了我们所犯错误的严重性。我们受了坏人的骗，上了坏人的当，我们站到了资产阶级的反动立场上，对抗以您老人家为代表的无产阶级革命路线。我们深恶痛绝自己的犯罪行为，向您老人家请罪。
    这次严重错误的根源，是我们的思想没有改造好，因而在大风大浪中迷失了方向。我们一定吸取这次严重错误的教训，擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，站稳无产阶级立场。
    我们向您老人家保证：
    一、坚决读您老人家的书，听您的话，按您的指示办事，做您的好学生。一定在文化大革命中，灭资兴无，不断改造自己，破私立公，紧紧跟着您老人家闹革命。
    二、我们这次来京控告，是完全错了，我们受了赤卫队总部的蒙蔽，我们要大造赤卫队总部的反，揪出幕后指使人。
    三、我们坚决响应您老人家抓革命，促生产的号召，立即回到上海去，参加单位的文化大革命和生产斗争，对于我们这次来北京给生产上带来的损失，我们一定补起来！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
