The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged the strongest protest with the Indonesian government over the severe incident of the Chinese Consulate in Medan being repeatedly attacked by local military police and right-wing thugs. The Indonesian government cannot shirk its responsibility for disrupting China's work of repatriating its nationals.

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs handed a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on January 25th, strongly protesting the serious incident of the Chinese Consulate in Medan being attacked multiple times by local military police and right-wing thugs.

The note states: On the morning of January 18th, the military authorities in Medan sent personnel accompanied by armed soldiers to the Chinese Consulate three times, attempting to deprive the Chinese Consulate of its right to hoist its national flag and forcibly lower the Chinese flag. In the afternoon, a large number of right-wing organizations in Indonesia, such as "Pancasila Youth," "KAMI," and "KAPPI," along with a few Kuomintang remnants, stormed the Chinese Consulate twice, causing extensive damage and writing anti-China and defamatory slogans against the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. After the Chinese Consul lodged a protest with the North Sumatra Provincial Government over this serious incident, another group of thugs broke into the Consulate on the 20th to cause further damage and looting. As they left, these thugs shouted slogans such as "Long live Nasution!" and "Long live Suharto!"

The note points out: The day after the Chinese Consul in Medan arrived to arrange the third batch of repatriation for the affected overseas Chinese, and just as the Chinese repatriation ship was about to arrive in Medan, this serious incident occurred. What does this mean? The Medan military authorities not only sent personnel to forcibly deprive the Chinese Consulate of its right to hoist its national flag, grossly violating internationally recognized diplomatic norms; during the repeated attacks and destruction of the Chinese Consulate by Indonesian right-wing thugs, they also received the tacit support and even direction of the large number of military police present. And that small group of Kuomintang remnants were brought from afar to participate in this atrocity. What does this mean? The undeniable facts show that this was a planned and organized act of violence aimed at further obstructing and disrupting China's repatriation work.

The Indonesian government bears an inescapable responsibility for such a serious incident. The Chinese government strongly protests this to the Indonesian government.

The note points out: After plotting this atrocity, the Indonesian authorities openly made four demands through their representatives to the Chinese Consul: to have the Indonesian side arrange the list of repatriates, to have China repatriate overseas Chinese from a certain region as designated by the Indonesian side, to have China bear the transportation costs for the refugees from the reception center to the dock, and to have China be responsible for supplying food and medicine for the refugees, etc. These demands are utterly absurd and unreasonable. Have you not adhered to the agreements reached between the two sides regarding the arrangements for repatriation work? You arbitrarily persecute overseas Chinese and still want the Chinese side to bear the costs for food and medicine, etc.? Is there any such logic in the world?

The note states: You think that by taking such violent threats and unreasonable actions, you can achieve your goals. Let me tell you frankly, this is absolutely impossible. This will only further expose your ugly face. Your unreasonable demands have already been firmly rejected by the Chinese Consul, and the Chinese government once again solemnly rejects your unreasonable demands.

The note finally warns the Indonesian government: It must immediately take effective measures to stop similar incidents from happening, and must apologize and compensate for the losses to the Chinese Consulate, ensure the safety of the Chinese Consul and the Chinese Consulate, and guarantee the smooth progress of China's third batch of repatriation work. Otherwise, the Indonesian government will have to bear all the consequences that arise from this.

　　我外交部最强烈抗议印尼当局指使暴徒袭击我棉兰领事馆
　　印尼政府推卸不了破坏中国接侨工作的罪行
    新华社二十五日讯 中国外交部一月二十五日把一件照会交给印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，就中国驻印尼棉兰领事馆遭受当地军警和右派暴徒多次袭击的严重事件，向印尼政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说：一月十八日上午，棉兰军事当局三次派员随带武装军人闯入中国领事馆，企图剥夺中国领事馆升挂本国国旗的权利，强行降下中国国旗。下午又有大批印尼右派组织“潘查希拉青年”、“卡米”、“卡比”的暴徒和少数蒋帮分子，两次冲入中国领事馆，大肆破坏，到处涂写反华和辱骂中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的标语。在中国领事就这一严重事件向北苏门答腊省政府提出抗议之后，又有一批暴徒于二十日闯入领事馆进行破坏和抢掠。这批暴徒在离开时，狂呼“纳苏蒂安万岁”，“苏哈托万岁”等口号。
    照会指出：在中国驻棉兰领事赶到棉兰安排第三次接运受害华侨的工作的第二天，在中国接侨船只业已启航即将抵达棉兰的时候，发生上述严重事件，意味着什么呢？棉兰军事当局不但派人强行剥夺中国领事馆升挂本国国旗的权利，粗暴破坏了公认的国际关系准则；在印尼右派暴徒再三袭击和破坏中国领事馆时，也得到在场的大批军警的纵容，甚至于指挥；而那一小撮蒋帮分子还是从远地调来参加这一暴行的。这些又意味着什么呢？无可置辩的事实说明，这是一次有计划、有组织的暴行，目的在于进一步阻挠和破坏中国的接侨工作。
    对这样严重事件，印尼政府负有不可推卸的责任。中国政府为此向印尼政府提出最强烈抗议。
    照会指出：印尼当局在策划这一暴行之后，公然由它的代表向中国领事提四项要求：由印尼方面安排接侨名单，中国接走由印尼方面规定的某一地区的华侨，中国负担难侨由收容所到码头的交通费用，中国负责供应难侨的粮食和药品，等等。这些要求是十分荒唐无理的。双方关于接侨工作的安排所达成的协议，你们不遵守了吗？你们恣意迫害华侨，还要中国方面为你们负担粮食药品等费用，天下有这样的道理吗？
    照会说：你们以为采取这种暴力威胁和无理取闹的手段，就可以达到你们的目的。老实告诉你们，这是绝对办不到的。这只能进一步暴露你们的丑恶面目。你们的无理要求已经遭到中国领事的坚决拒绝，中国政府再一次严正拒绝你们的无理要求。
    照会最后正告印尼政府：必须立即采取有效措施，制止类似事件的发生，并就上述事件惩凶道歉，赔偿中国领事馆的损失，保证中国领事和中国领事馆的安全，保证中国第三次接侨工作顺利进行。否则，由此而引起的一切后果必须由印尼政府承担。
