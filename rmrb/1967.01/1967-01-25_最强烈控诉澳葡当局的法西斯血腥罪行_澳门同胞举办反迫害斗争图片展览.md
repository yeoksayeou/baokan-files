The "Macao Compatriots' Anti-Persecution Struggle Photo Exhibition" was held from January 15 to 22 in Macao. The broad masses of Macao compatriots angrily denounced the fascist bloody atrocities of the Portuguese authorities in the exhibition hall, sternly warning the Portuguese authorities: They must immediately admit their crimes, meet the four conditions set by the Foreign Affairs Department of the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee, and the six demands of the Macao compatriots. If they continue to use two-faced tactics, delay, evade, and avoid the main issues, the Macao compatriots armed with Mao Zedong Thought will resolutely fight to the end.

After the exhibition opened, over 40,000 viewers were received in eight days. Five "12.3" incident victims still hospitalized, accompanied by medical staff to view the exhibition, strongly denounced the Portuguese authorities' savage massacre of Chinese compatriots. The surrounding audience, after hearing this, raised their fists and shouted, "Strongly protest against the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities!"

Tens of thousands of viewers, with boundless love, admiration, and faith in the great leader Chairman Mao, read aloud together time and time again the giant quotation from Chairman Mao hanging below his portrait in the center of the exhibition hall: "Create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." They read aloud time and time again the preface to the second edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" written by Comrade Lin Biao and hanging on the central wall at the exhibition entrance; they sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" time and time again, and shouted slogans such as "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" Many viewers wrote down inspiring messages after their visit. A female teacher wrote: "This is a lesson in blood, a lesson in blood that makes us see the true face of imperialism, more cunning than a fox. This lesson in blood proves that all reactionary things, if you do not fight them, they will not fall. This lesson in blood shows that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. Let us never forget this lesson in blood, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to fight to the end!"

　　最强烈控诉澳葡当局的法西斯血腥罪行
　　澳门同胞举办反迫害斗争图片展览
    新华社香港二十四日电　“澳门同胞反迫害斗争图片展览”十五日至二十二日在澳门举行。广大澳门同胞在展览大厅中愤怒地控诉澳葡当局的法西斯血腥暴行，严正警告澳葡当局：必须立即低头认罪，实现广东省人民委员会外事处长的四项条件和澳门同胞的六项要求，如果继续采取两面手法，拖延狡赖，避重就轻，用毛泽东思想武装起来的澳门同胞就要坚决斗争到底。
    展览会开幕后，在八天时间内共接待了四万多名观众。由医护人员陪同前来观看展览的五名仍在医院留医的“一二·三”事件受害者，最强烈地控诉澳葡当局野蛮屠杀中国同胞的暴行，周围的观众听了后振臂高呼：“强烈抗议澳葡当局的法西斯暴行！”
    成千上万的观众怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限崇拜，无限信仰的心情，一遍又一遍地齐声朗读会场内正中的毛主席画像下悬挂的巨幅毛主席语录：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”一遍又一遍地朗读在会场入口处的正中墙壁上悬挂的林彪同志写的《毛主席语录》再版前言；一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，高呼“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁”等口号。许多观众参观后写下了斗志昂扬的留言。一位女教师写道：“这是血的一课，这血的一课使我们认清帝国主义的面目比狐狸还狡猾。这血的一课，证明凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这血的一课，说明用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是天下无敌的。让我们永远不忘这血的一课，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗斗争到底！”
