The Albanian National Song and Dance Troupe led by Ba·Peiyue left Beijing by special plane today to visit and perform in various places in southern China. Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Zhou Yiping and other relevant officials, along with over 600 Red Guards from the capital, went to the airport to give them a warm send-off.

During their visit and performances in the capital, the Albanian artists from the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist front watched the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Red Lantern," the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," and the play "Drums of the Equator," and visited the sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard." They enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the Chinese artists in holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and creating new proletarian art. They said, "This is a great achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."
