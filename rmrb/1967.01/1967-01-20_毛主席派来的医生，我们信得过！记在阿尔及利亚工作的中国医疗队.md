Doctors Sent by Chairman Mao, We Trust Them!
The Chinese Medical Team Working in Algeria

The thirty-five medical personnel of the Chinese medical team working in Algeria have been following Chairman Mao's teachings and are determined to become collective White-flagged internationalist warriors of the proletariat. In the year they have worked in Algeria, they have striven to study Chairman Mao's works, and in their work, they have always demanded of themselves the spirit of selflessness and dedication to the people that Comrade White-flagged exemplified. They have cast aside selfish thoughts, bravely overcome difficulties, and taken their work very seriously, showing great enthusiasm for the patients. The Algerian people, in their simple language, have given a passionate evaluation of the work of the Chinese medical personnel. They say: "Doctors sent by Chairman Mao, we trust them!"

Overcoming All Difficulties to Save Patients

The Chinese medical team has taken on the medical tasks of the Mascara County Hospital and the Saida Provincial Hospital. On the third day after the Chinese medical team arrived in Mascara, a woman named Kadena, who had come from a village, was sent to the hospital. She lay on the bed in a state of deep shock, her life hanging by a thread, and an emergency cesarean section had to be performed immediately. However, the county hospital's conditions were poor, and the patient needed a large amount of blood, but the hospital had no blood bank.

Faced with such a serious situation, the medical team members decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, putting the patient first, overcoming all difficulties, and doing everything possible to save her. Thus, a tense rescue operation began that very night. The Chinese medical team members all pitched in together with the hospital's management, working together to find blood and medicine. Everyone worked through the night, and it was not until the next morning at around eleven o'clock that the operation was completed. Then, the Chinese doctors and midwives took turns watching over the patient day and night. More than a month later, she had fully recovered. She gratefully told the Chinese doctors, "Thank you, doctors, you are so good!"

Chinese Doctors Are Trustworthy

One day, an old painter named Amara was sent to the hospital where the Chinese medical team was stationed. He had suffered from stomach problems for more than ten years, had been hospitalized three times, and foreign doctors had been unable to diagnose his condition or provide any treatment. As a result, his condition had worsened to the point where he could not get out of bed. After a thorough examination by the Chinese doctors, it was confirmed that the worker had gastric ulcers, and it was decided that he needed a gastrectomy. He hesitated at first, but after the Chinese medical personnel did some persuading, he agreed to the operation. After the operation, due to the careful treatment and care of the Chinese doctors, he was able to eat on the third day, walk on the fifth day, and was discharged after two weeks. He excitedly told people that he had never seen Chinese doctors with such a serious and responsible attitude, and that Chinese doctors were trustworthy.

Once, an emergency patient was sent to the hospital. This man, named Buma, was a cleaner who had been stabbed in the heart and was on the verge of death. The medical team's personnel immediately launched a race-against-time rescue operation, opening the patient's chest cavity. The patient's heart had been stabbed in two places, and blood was gushing out like a fountain. After more than two hours of rescue, the patient's heart was sewn up, and he was saved from danger. The mortality rate for such injuries is very high, and this was the first time such an operation had been performed at the Mascara Hospital. The news spread, and many people came to shake hands with the Chinese doctors and thank them for saving another Algerian comrade. The hospital's driver sighed, "The Chinese doctors are great, this is the luck of the people of Mascara."

Dedicated to Serving the Patients

To better serve the patients, the members of the Chinese medical team all live together in a house near the hospital. Whether it is a Sunday or deep in the night, as long as the patients need them, they are ready to go. The eye, ear, nose, and throat, and acupuncture departments each have only one Chinese doctor, who not only serves as a doctor but also as a nurse. They have a lot of work and heavy tasks, but they never complain. In the past year, the eye doctor has treated more than a hundred patients with eye diseases, most of whom are hardworking people, some of whom have come from far away from the Sahara to seek treatment for their blindness.

The Chinese medical personnel are serious and responsible in their work, and they care for the patients with enthusiasm. They often visit the patients in the wards, asking after their health. They also guard the critically ill patients day and night, turning them over, wiping them down, feeding them milk and medicine. The Chinese doctors carry the patients' stretchers and wash the instruments. Their spirit of serving the patients without regard for fatigue has been widely praised.

A road worker suffering from heart disease said, "Before the Chinese doctors came, I had been hospitalized, and the foreign doctors did not even look at me for several days. The attitude of the Chinese doctors is completely different. They live among us all day, and they even feed me medicine and water. I have never seen such good service from doctors. Long live Mao Zedong, the Chinese people taught by Chairman Mao are truly good!"

Seeing the Brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought

The workers, farmers, old soldiers, teachers, elders, women, and children in Algeria who have been treated by the Chinese medical team all say in unison, "Thank Chairman Mao for sending us such good doctors to treat our illnesses and relieve our pain." The oil painter Amara, who had surgery in the hospital, cut out Chairman Mao's portrait from a magazine and hung it on his bedside to thank the Chinese doctors for curing his stomach disease. After being discharged from the hospital, he took Chairman Mao's portrait home and pasted it on the wall.

He said, "During the Algerian War of Independence, Chairman Mao gave us selfless aid; today he has sent us such good doctors to serve the Algerian people. I will work for the rest of my life to strengthen Algerian-Chinese friendship to thank Chairman Mao."

A sixty-year-old man named Abdeka, after being treated by a Chinese acupuncture doctor, tightly held the doctor's hand and said, "Thank Chairman Mao for sending you to cure my illness. Your enthusiastic and responsible attitude towards patients has left a deep impression on me. From you, I have seen the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought."

Chairman Mao Is Always with Us

A farmer named Stada suffered a severe head injury and could not speak. After being treated by Chinese doctors, he regained his ability to speak. When his mother came to the hospital to visit him, he introduced the Chinese doctors to his mother, saying, "This is the Chinese doctor sent by Chairman Mao Zedong." He also opened a copy of "People's Pictorial," pointed to the portrait of Chairman Mao on the magazine, and said to his mother, "Look, this is the great leader Chairman Mao! Everything he does is for the interests of workers and peasants. I respect him and love him."

In the hospital, patients often discuss how the work of the Chinese medical personnel is so responsible and enthusiastic towards patients because they are sent by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. They thank Chairman Mao a thousand times and ten thousand times.

The patients feel extremely happy to be able to get a badge with Chairman Mao's portrait. Some people wear the badge on their chests and excitedly say, "Chairman Mao is always with me."

    毛主席派来的医生，我们信得过！
    记在阿尔及利亚工作的中国医疗队
    正在阿尔及利亚工作的中国医疗队的三十五名医务人员，遵循毛主席的教导，决心做一个集体的白求恩式的无产阶级国际主义战士。他们在阿尔及利亚工作的整整一年里，努力学习毛主席著作，在工作中时时刻刻以白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神要求自己，排除私心杂念，勇于克服困难，对工作高度的负责，对病人极其热忱。阿尔及利亚人民以简朴的语言，对中国医务人员的工作作出了热情的评价。他们说：“毛主席派来的医生，我们信得过！”
    排除万难，抢救病人
    中国医疗队承担了马斯卡拉县立医院和赛伊达省立医院的医疗任务。在中国医疗队到达马斯卡拉的第三天，有一位从农村来的名叫卡德娜的产妇，被送到医院，躺在病床上，处在深度的休克状态，生命危在旦夕，必须赶快施行剖腹手术抢救。但是，县立医院条件较差，病人需要大量输血，医院没有血库。
    面对这样严重的情况，医疗队的人员决定按照毛主席的教导，一切从病人出发，排除万难，千方百计进行抢救。于是一场紧张的抢救工作便连夜开始了。中国医疗队人员一齐动手同医院的负责人一起，共同协作，缺血找血，缺药找药。大家通宵未眠，一直到第二天上午十一点多钟才做完手术。接着，中国医生和助产士白天、黑夜轮流守护在病人身旁。一个多月过后，她终于完全恢复了健康。她感激地对中国医生说：“谢谢医生，你们太好啦！”
    中国医生是信得过的
    有一天，一位名叫阿马拉的油漆老工人被送到中国医疗队所在的医院里去。他害了十多年胃病，曾经三次住医院，外国医生诊断不出什么病症，也没有给他进行任何治疗，因此，病势越来越重，以致卧床不起。经过中国医生详细诊断后，肯定这位工人得了胃溃疡，决定要做胃切除手术。他起初犹豫不决，但经中国医务人员做了思想说服工作后，他就同意动手术了。动手术后，由于中国医生的细心治疗和护理，手术后的第三天他便可以吃东西，五天下床，两个星期就出院了。他激动地对人们说，他从来没有见过中国医生这样认真负责的精神，中国医生是信得过的。
    有一次，医院里来了一个急诊病人。这个名叫布马扎的清洁工人，心脏受刀伤，濒于死亡，医疗队的医务人员马上投入了分秒必争的紧张战斗，破开病人的胸腔，病人的心脏被刀刺了两个洞，血像泉水一样往外喷。经过两个多小时的抢救，病人的心脏被缝起了，转危为安。这种创伤的死亡率很高，马斯卡拉医院还是头一次动这种手术。消息传出后，很多人跑来同中国医生握手祝贺，感谢中国医生又救活了一个阿尔及利亚阶级兄弟。医院的司机感叹地说：“中国医生太好了，这是马斯卡拉人的幸运。”
    热心为病人服务
    为了更好地为病人服务，中国医疗队同志都集体住在医院附近的一座房子里，不管星期天，或深更半夜，只要病人需要，随叫随到。
    眼科、耳鼻喉科和针灸科都各只有一个中国医生，他们既是医生，又是护士，事情多，任务重，但从不叫苦叫累。一年来，眼科医生治好了眼睛失明的病人一百多个，其中大多是劳苦群众，有的是远道从撒哈拉来求医的双眼失明的老牧民。
    中国医务人员对工作认真负责，对病人热情关怀。他们经常到病房看望病人，问寒问暖。他们还日夜看守着病重的患者，替病人翻身、擦身、喂奶、喂药。中国医生给病人抬担架，洗器械。他们不顾疲乏地为病人服务的精神，得到了普遍的好评。
    一位患心脏病的修路工人感慨地说：“中国医生没来以前，我就住过医院，当时的外国医生好几天不看我一次。中国医生的作风完全不同，整天生活在我们当中，还给我喂药、喂水。我从来没有看见过像中国医生这样好的服务态度。毛泽东真伟大，毛主席教导出来的中国人真好！”
    看到了毛泽东思想的光辉
    阿尔及利亚的工人、农民、老战士、教员、老人、妇女和儿童，凡是受过中国医疗队治疗的，都异口同声地说，“感谢毛泽东主席为我们派来这样好的医生，替我们治病，解除我们的病痛。”那位在医院里动过手术的油漆工人阿马拉为了感谢中国医生治好了他的胃病，从画报上剪下毛主席的像，挂在床头。出院以后，又把毛主席像带回家贴在墙上。
    他说：“在阿尔及利亚抗法战争时期，毛主席给了我们无私的援助；今天他又派来这样好的医生，为我们阿尔及利亚人民服务。我要终身为加强阿中友谊而工作，来感谢毛主席。”
    一位名叫阿卜德卡的六十岁的老人，在中国针灸医生替他治好病后，紧紧握着医生的手说：“感谢毛主席派你们来治好我的病。你们对病人热情负责的精神，给我留下了难忘的印象。从你们的身上，我看到了毛泽东思想的光辉。”毛主席永远和我们在一起
    农民斯达赫因重度脑外伤，不能说话，经中国医生治疗后，恢复了说话能力。当他的母亲来医院看望他时，他向母亲介绍中国医生说：“这就是毛泽东主席派来的中国医生。”他还翻开一本《人民画报》，指着画报上的毛主席像对母亲说：“你看，这就是伟大的领袖毛主席！他所做的一切，都是从工人、农民的利益出发的。我尊敬他，热爱他。”
    在医院里，病人们经常在议论说，中国医务人员的工作所以这样负责，对病人这样热忱，是因为他们是中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席派来的。千谢万谢，应该感谢毛主席。
    病人们为能得到一枚毛主席像章而感到无比的幸福。有的人把毛主席像章挂在胸前，兴奋地说：“毛主席永远和我在一起。”
