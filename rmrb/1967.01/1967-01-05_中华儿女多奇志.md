The Chinese people have great aspirations. This is the enthusiastic praise of our great leader Chairman Mao for the revolutionary will of the Chinese people, and a high summary of the spiritual face of this great era.

In 1966, a year that passed in the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people with great aspirations created countless heroic deeds that shocked the world. The "Heroic Ship of the South China Sea" fighting in the Gulf of Tonkin is a brilliant page in the epic of the Chinese people's heroes.

The comrades on the "Heroic Ship of the South China Sea" are brave warriors in the face of the enemy and iron men in the face of difficulties. They have the resolve "to fear neither hardship nor difficulty, neither death nor sacrifice, and to be ready to dedicate themselves to the world revolution at any time." The American bandits can blow up their cargo ships, but they cannot shake their firm will to aid Vietnam and resist America. They are indeed models of the Chinese people in the Mao Zedong era.

We are now in a new great era of world revolution. Facing the new situation of class struggle at home and abroad, we must not only be steadfast domestic revolutionaries but also steadfast international revolutionaries. This is the great aspiration of the Chinese people, the great ambition of the Chinese people.

The road of revolution is not smooth but full of twists and turns and difficulties. However, as long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "to make up our minds, not to be afraid of sacrifice, to overcome all difficulties, and to strive for victory," we will surely achieve our goal. In the past, we overcame countless hardships and removed the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism that had been weighing down on the Chinese people. Today, we have the same conviction: the comprehensive offensive launched by the bourgeoisie and their agents in our party in various fields over the long term will be thoroughly smashed by us, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will achieve a thorough victory. The anti-China alliance led by U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and reactionaries from various countries will also be thoroughly smashed by us. All harmful creatures will be swept clean from the earth.

Where do the great aspirations of the Chinese people come from? They come from the great thought of Mao Zedong. It is Mao Zedong Thought that enables the Chinese people to dare to climb peaks that no one has ever climbed and to walk paths that no one has ever walked, creating one miracle after another. Similarly, it is Mao Zedong Thought that enables the comrades on the "Heroic Ship of the South China Sea" to complete the glorious task of aiding Vietnam and resisting America, regardless of bombs, rockets, stormy waves, or desolate islands. The red line running through their heroic deeds is to take Mao Zedong Thought as a beacon, guiding their actions with Mao Zedong Thought at all times and in all places. They deeply feel that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is more important than weapons when the enemy is madly bombing and strafing, more precious than food when hungry, and more effective than medicine when injured.

The most fundamental thing in arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought is to break down selfishness and establish public spirit, to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology, and to establish a communist worldview. We should be like the comrades on the "Heroic Ship of the South China Sea," with no selfish motives, always thinking of the 700 million people in China and the 3 billion people in the world, and wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people and the people of the world. Only such people can be full of fighting spirit and spirit of sacrifice, and strive for the great cause of communism and the thorough liberation of mankind.

The Chinese people nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought will surely withstand greater tests and tempering in the great storms of class struggle at home and abroad, and create more miracles.

    中华儿女多奇志
    “中华儿女多奇志”，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席对我国人民革命意志的热情赞扬，对我们这个伟大时代精神面貌的高度概括。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中度过的一九六六年，胸怀奇志的中华儿女，创造了无数震惊世界的英雄业绩。战斗在北部湾的“南海英雄船”，就是我国人民英雄诗篇中灿烂的一页。
    “南海英雄船”的同志们，在敌人面前是勇敢的战士，在困难面前是铁打的硬汉。他们抱有“不怕苦，不怕难，不怕死，随时准备献身世界革命的决心”。美国飞贼能够炸沉他们的货船，却丝毫动摇不了他们援越抗美的坚强意志。他们不愧是毛泽东时代中华儿女的榜样。
    我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大时代。面对着国内外阶级斗争的新形势，我们不仅要做坚定的国内革命派，而且要做坚定的国际革命派。这就是我国人民的奇志，我国人民的伟大抱负。
    革命的道路不是平坦的，而是曲折的，充满艰难险阻的。但是，只要按照毛主席的教导，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，我们就一定能够达到目的。过去，我们历尽千辛万苦，搬掉了压在中国人民头上的帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山。今天，我们同样有这样的信念：资产阶级及其在我们党内的代理人长期以来在各个领域所发动的全面进攻必将被我们彻底粉碎，无产阶级文化大革命必将取得彻底的胜利。以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的反华同盟，也必将被我们彻底粉碎。一切害人虫都将从地球上被扫除干净。
    中华儿女的奇志哪里来？来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。是毛泽东思想，使我国人民敢于攀登前人没有攀登过的高峰，敢于走前人所没有走过的道路，创造了一个又一个的奇迹。同样，是毛泽东思想，使“南海英雄船”的同志们，为了完成援越抗美的光荣任务，什么炸弹，什么火箭，什么惊涛骇浪，什么渺无人烟的荒岛，全都不在话下。贯穿在他们英雄事迹中的一条红线，就是以毛泽东思想为灯塔，时时处处用毛泽东思想来指导自己的行动。他们深切地感到：战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在敌人疯狂轰炸扫射的时候比武器还重要，在饥饿的时候比粮食还宝贵，在伤痛的时候比药物还灵验。
    用毛泽东思想武装头脑，最根本的，就是要破私立公，灭资兴无，确立共产主义的世界观。我们要像“南海英雄船”的同志们那样，毫无自私自利之心，时刻想到中国七亿人民和世界三十亿人民，全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务。这样的人，才能充满战斗精神与牺牲精神，才能为伟大的共产主义事业，为人类的彻底解放奋斗到底。
    毛泽东思想哺育下的中华儿女，在国内外阶级斗争的大风浪中，一定会经受得住更大的考验和锻炼，创造出更多的奇迹来。
