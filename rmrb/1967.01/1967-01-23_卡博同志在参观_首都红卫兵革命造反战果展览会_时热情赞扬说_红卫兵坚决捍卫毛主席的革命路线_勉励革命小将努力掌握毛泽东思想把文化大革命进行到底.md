Comrade Kaba, while visiting the "Capital Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel Achievements Exhibition," enthusiastically praised, saying:

The Red Guards resolutely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

He encouraged the revolutionary youth to strive to master Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, January 22nd: Comrade Hysni Kapo, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labor of Albania, Comrade Behar Shytu, a member of the Central Committee, and Comrade Vasili Natanaeli, the Albanian Ambassador to China, accompanied by Comrade Kang Sheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Comrade Liu Xiao, a member of the Central Committee, visited the "Capital Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel Achievements Exhibition" which is currently being prepared.

Comrade Kapo, Comrade Shytu, and Comrade Natanaeli inscribed the following message for the exhibition:

"After visiting the Beijing Red Guards exhibition, we warmly welcome the glorious revolutionary actions of the Red Guards. They faithfully execute the great Marxist-Leninist teachings and thoughts of the great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, whom the Chinese Party and people respect. They are fighting resolutely, bravely, and tenaciously for the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, to smash the right-wing elements and revisionists, to smash the imperialists led by American imperialism and the modern revisionists centered around the traitorous leadership of the CPSU, and to defend Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist line and ensure its victory. We sincerely wish the Red Guards greater victories in their arduous yet glorious and honorable struggle.

Long live the Red Guards!

Glory to the great teacher and leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the 700 million Chinese people, the respected friend of the Albanian people, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the eternal friendship between the Albanian people and the brotherly Chinese people, forged by the two Marxist-Leninist parties led by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

When Comrades Kapo, Shytu, and Natanaeli arrived at the exhibition, the Red Guards and staff working there, holding high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically lined up to welcome the comrades from Albania, the frontline of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle in Europe. The crowd shouted, "Long live the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania! Down with imperialism! Down with modern revisionism! Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha! Long live Chairman Mao!" The Red Guards presented Comrades Kapo, Shytu, and Natanaeli with Red Guard armbands and Chairman Mao badges. Comrades Kapo and others, with smiles on their faces, warmly shook hands and embraced the Red Guard youth.

The Red Guard representative first spoke, expressing the warmest welcome to Comrades Kapo and others for coming to visit.

Comrade Kapo, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," spoke enthusiastically. He praised the Red Guards, workers, and peasants for following Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely opposing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, resolutely sweeping away all ghosts and monsters in society, and resolutely defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. In the struggle, they have enthusiastically studied and propagated Mao Zedong Thought, achieving brilliant victories and writing a glorious page in the history of the Chinese revolution.

Comrade Kapo encouraged the Red Guard youth to strive to master Mao Zedong Thought, to take the study and propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as their sacred mission and revolutionary task, to make Mao Zedong Thought deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and become the guide for their actions, and to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end. Comrade Kapo also warmly wished that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great friendship between the two Marxist-Leninist parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of Albania and China would be further consolidated and developed.

Comrade Kang Sheng, in his speech, expressed his heartfelt thanks for Comrade Kapo's remarks. He said that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, let the peoples of China and Albania always have their hearts connected, shoulders together, and hands joined, and let us advance victoriously in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism and in the defense of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Subsequently, Comrades Kapo and others visited various sections of the exhibition, viewing pictures of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao receiving the Red Guards and revolutionary masses eight times, viewing pictures and real objects reflecting how the Red Guards, under Chairman Mao's care and support, were born and grew, how they strove to master Mao Zedong Thought, how they conducted revolutionary tours, broke the old and established the new, swept away all ghosts and monsters, and how they resolutely fought against the capitalist-roaders within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

During the visit, Comrades Kapo and others had cordial conversations with the Red Guards, introducing the situation of Albanian youth responding to the Party's call to go to the mountains and countryside for revolution and construction. Comrade Kapo happily said, "Being with the Red Guards, I feel younger and more energetic." The Red Guards expressed to Comrades Kapo and others that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people and youth, and definitely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end to repay the praise of the Albanian comrades.

    卡博同志勉励红卫兵小将们要努力掌握毛泽东思想，要把学习和宣传毛泽东思想作为自己的崇高使命，当成革命的任务，要使毛泽东思想印在人民心里，并成为人民的行动的指南，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。卡博同志还热情祝愿在毛主席和恩维尔·霍查同志领导下，中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的伟大友谊，日益巩固和发展。
    康生同志在致词中对卡博同志的讲话表示最衷心的感谢。他说，在毛主席和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，让中阿两国人民永远心连着心，肩并着肩，手拉着手，让我们在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的斗争中，在捍卫马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的斗争中，胜利前进。
    随后，卡博等同志参观了展览会的各个部分，看了毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志八次接见红卫兵和革命群众的图片，看了反映红卫兵怎样在毛主席关怀支持下诞生壮大，如何努力掌握毛泽东思想，如何进行革命大串连，破四旧、立四新，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，如何为捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，向党内走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动路线进行坚决斗争的图片和实物。
    卡博等同志在参观中，同红卫兵亲切交谈，介绍了阿尔巴尼亚青年响应党的号召，上山下乡，进行革命和建设的情况。卡博同志高兴地说，和红卫兵在一起，我感到更年青了，更有力量了。红卫兵们向卡博等同志表示，他们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，要学习阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年的革命精神，一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，来酬谢阿尔巴尼亚同志的称誉。
