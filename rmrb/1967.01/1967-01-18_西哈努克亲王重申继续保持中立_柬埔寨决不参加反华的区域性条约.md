Prince Sihanouk of Cambodia recently stated in an interview that Cambodia will not join regional economic pacts that serve as political tools for major powers, nor will it participate in any defense pacts. He emphasized that Cambodia will continue to maintain its neutrality and will not align with those who act as spokesmen for foreign countries.

Prince Sihanouk made these remarks in response to a question from a reporter of the British newspaper *The Guardian*.

When the British reporter asked whether he supported regional economic cooperation in Southeast Asia or perhaps a defense pact involving only countries in the region, Prince Sihanouk stressed, "It has been proven that regional economic pacts are actually political tools for major powers. As long as neighboring countries cannot escape foreign political influence and act as spokesmen for foreign countries, I do not see the possibility of Cambodia uniting with them.

Our country is neutral and will continue to be so. It will certainly not join any defense pact, even if the major power that instigates such a pact keeps itself outside the pact. Let us be frank: any pact, whether economic or defense-related, that is proposed to us now, its target can only be Beijing or Hanoi. Its deceitful intentions are obvious."

Prince Sihanouk also condemned the Thai military's incursions into Cambodian borders. He pointed out, "These acts of aggression prove that Thailand has adopted a fundamentally hostile attitude towards Cambodia and has the intention of annexing Cambodian territory. The prince said, 'No country in the world will tolerate such a situation.'

According to a recent issue of the Cambodian weekly *Nationalist*, a commentary was published.

The commentary, discussing the continuous aggression and threats from American imperialism and its lackeys against Cambodia, aimed at forcing Cambodia to abandon its policy of national independence and neutrality, noted that for the past thirteen years, the Cambodian people have successfully resisted the enemy's aggression and threats, relying on their own strength, which is the most reliable and solid force. They have steadfastly withstood the continuous pressure on their borders. No matter how great the pressure from the aggressors has been in the past or how great it will be in the future, it will never make the Cambodian people deviate from the policy of national independence and neutrality that they have chosen.

    西哈努克亲王重申继续保持中立 
    柬埔寨决不参加反华的区域性条约
    据新华社金边十六日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王最近在一次谈话中宣布，柬埔寨将不参加充当大国的政治工具的地区性经济条约，更不会参加任何“防务条约”。他说，柬埔寨将继续保持中立，不会和那些充当外国代言人的人联合。
    西哈努克亲王是在回答英国《卫报》的一个记者的问题时发表这个谈话的。
    当英国记者问他是不是支持东南亚地区性“经济合作”或者也许是没有其他地区国家参加的这个地区的“防务条约”时，西哈努克亲王强调指出：“早已证明，地区性的经济条约实际上是大国的政治工具。
    只要那些邻国不能免受外国的政治影响，而且还充当外国的代言人，我就看不出柬埔寨有同它们联合在一起的可能性。
    我国是中立国而且将继续保持中立，它当然更不会参加任何防务条约，即使指使缔结这个条约的大国自己置身于条约之外。让我们坦率地这样说：目前会向我们提出的条约，不论是经济方面的还是属于防务方面的，其矛头只能是指向北京或河内的。其狡诈用心是昭然若揭的。”
    西哈努克亲王还谴责泰国军队侵略柬埔寨的边境。他指出：“这些侵略行为，证明泰国对柬埔寨采取根本敌对的态度并有并吞柬埔寨领土的企图。亲王说：“世界上任何国家都不会容忍这种局面。”
    据新华社金边电　最近出版的一期柬埔寨《民族主义者》周刊发表一篇社论。
    社论在谈到美帝国主义和它的走狗对柬埔寨的不断侵略和恫吓，企图迫使柬埔寨放弃它的民族独立和中立政策时指出，十三年来，柬埔寨人民胜利地抗击了敌人的侵略和威胁，依靠自己的力量，因为这是最可靠、最牢固的力量，坚持不懈地顶住了对它的边境不断施加的压力。不管侵略者过去对柬埔寨施加的压力怎样大，也不管将来的压力会怎样大，都决不能使柬埔寨人民脱离他们所选定的民族独立和中立的政策。
