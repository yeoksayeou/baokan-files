The power of great Mao Zedong Thought is boundless. Revolutionaries from various countries are striving to study Chairman Mao's works to arm themselves.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, 20th January – All revolutionaries visiting China have one strong desire: to eagerly obtain the long-awaited guide to their struggle – Chairman Mao's works. Revolutionaries from various countries say that in the birthplace of great Mao Zedong Thought, in the center of the world revolution – China, we have obtained the brilliant works of Comrade Mao Zedong. This is our greatest happiness, the most precious gift from the Chinese people to us revolutionaries.

	Many foreign revolutionaries and friends have obtained the "Red Treasure Book," Chairman Mao's Quotations, in China. When they first hold this treasure book, many are so excited that tears well up in their eyes, regarding this moment as the happiest in their lives. Some gaze at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the cover page and shout loudly, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" Some sing loudly, "The great sea voyage relies on the helmsman." They say, Mao Zedong Thought is the eternal beacon illuminating the revolutionary path of the world's people. Chairman Mao's words are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand. Chairman Mao's Quotations concentrates the essence of Mao Zedong Thought. We have obtained Chairman Mao's Quotations, which is a priceless treasure, a powerful and sharp ideological weapon to oppose imperialism and modern revisionism.

	In Beijing, whether in hotels, or in the waiting lounges of airports and train stations, one often sees foreign friends taking out the red "Chairman Mao's Quotations" from their pockets and reading it word by word. The surrounding noise and vehicle sounds cannot disturb their concentrated study. Many foreign friends think that coming to China is a good opportunity to study Mao Zedong Thought. They always study eagerly, wherever they go. A friend from Laos said: As long as I read Chairman Mao's books, I forget everything else.

	Some say, reading Chairman Mao's books makes me feel full of strength. A Swiss friend, after obtaining Chairman Mao's Quotations in China, always carries it with him and studies it whenever he has time. Before every meal, he sits at the dining table and opens the quotations to study a few sayings; even when the hotel staff puts the food in front of him, he does not want to put the quotations away.

	Several Japanese friends, after arriving in Beijing, voluntarily organized a study group for Chairman Mao's Quotations. Every time they hold a study meeting, one person reads Chairman Mao's Quotations, and then everyone seriously discusses and exchanges their study experiences.

	On a flight departing from Beijing, several African friends seriously recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there. Only then are we good comrades." They use Chairman Mao's teachings to arm and inspire themselves. One day, in the waiting lounge of the capital airport, several African friends heard the staff reading Chairman Mao's Quotations, and they immediately asked the translator to translate the quotations word by word. When the staff gave them a few English versions of Chairman Mao's Quotations, although they did not understand English, they were still very happy and said, "We have friends who understand English, we will ask them to translate it, and we must study it well."

	Foreign friends, while studying Chairman Mao's Quotations during their visits and tours in China, feel even more intimate and understand it more deeply. Many anti-imperialist revolutionaries say, the great reality of China makes us once again deeply feel the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought and the limitless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. They express their determination, not fearing any risks, to take Chairman Mao's Quotations back to their own countries where they are fighting for liberation.

	They say, no matter how high the mountains are, or how deep the seas are, truth cannot be stopped. I will definitely take Chairman Mao's books back, and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to arm myself and the people of my country, forever holding high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and advancing to victory under the guidance of Chairman Mao.

    伟大的毛泽东思想威力无穷
　　各国革命战士努力学习毛主席著作武装自己
    新华社二十日讯　凡是来中国访问的各国的革命战士，他们都有一个强烈的要求，就是迫切地希望能够在中国得到他们盼望已久的、指导他们斗争的宝书——毛主席的著作。各国革命战士说，在伟大的毛泽东思想的发源地，在世界革命的中心——中国，我们得到毛泽东同志的光辉著作，这是我们最大的幸福，是中国人民给我们革命人民的最珍贵的礼物。
    许多外国革命战士和外国朋友，在中国得到了被称为红色宝书的《毛主席语录》。当他们初次捧起这本宝书的时候，很多人兴奋得热泪盈眶，把这一刻看作是他们一生中最幸福的一刻。有的人凝视着扉页上的毛主席像，连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”有的人放声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。他们说，毛泽东思想是永远照耀世界人民革命道路的灯塔。毛主席的话句句是真理，一句顶一万句。《毛主席语录》集中了毛泽东思想的精华。我们得到了《毛主席语录》，就是得到无价之宝，就是得到了反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义的强大的、犀利的思想武器。
    在北京，不管是在饭店里，或者在飞机场和火车站的候机室、候车室里，常常会看到一些外国朋友，从自己的衣服口袋里拿出红彤彤的《毛主席语录》一字一句地读起来。周围的人声、车声都丝毫不能打断他们专心一意地学习。很多外国朋友认为，来到中国是一次很好地学习毛泽东思想的机会。他们总是如饥如渴地学，走到哪里学到哪里。一位来自老挝的朋友说：只要一读毛主席的书，我别的事情就都忘记了。
    有的人说，读着毛泽东主席的书，我就感到浑身有了力量。有位瑞士朋友在中国得到《毛主席语录》以后，总是带在身上，一有空就学起来。他每天吃饭前，还要坐在餐桌前打开语录本学几条语录；饭店的服务员把饭放在他面前，他也舍不得把语录本合上。
    有几位日本朋友来到北京以后，自动组织起学习《毛主席语录》小组，每次开学习会，由一个人念《毛主席语录》，然后大家认真展开讨论，交换学习心得。
    在一次从北京起飞的飞机上，几位非洲朋友认真地背诵毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”他们就是这样用毛主席的教导来武装自己，激励自己。一天，在首都机场候机室里，有几位非洲朋友听到服务员读《毛主席语录》，他们马上请翻译把读的语录一字一句的翻译下来。当服务员送给他们几本英文版《毛主席语录》时，他们虽然不懂英文，仍然十分高兴地说，我们的朋友有懂英文的，我们要请他们翻译出来，一定要好好学习。
    外国朋友结合在中国的参观访问学习《毛主席语录》，更感到十分亲切，体会得更加深刻。许多反帝革命战士说，中国的伟大现实，使我们再一次深刻地感到毛泽东思想威力无穷，毛泽东思想的光辉无限。他们表示下定决心，不怕任何风险，要把《毛主席语录》带回自己正在进行解放斗争的祖国。
    他们说，不论山多么高，海多么深，真理是不能阻挡的。我一定要把毛主席的书带回去，要用无敌的毛泽东思想武装自己和自己国家中的人民，永远高高举起反帝反修的大旗，按照毛泽东主席指引的方向胜利前进。
