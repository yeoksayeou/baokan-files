	Crush the Enemy's New Counterattack

The Cultural Revolution is flourishing. Those in power who are taking the capitalist road are unwilling to accept defeat and are repeatedly playing tricks with economism to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line! What is economism? Revolutionaries can see through it in an instant: it is the rubbish of revisionism, a sugar-coated bullet! The enemy attempts to lead the Cultural Revolution astray and foolishly hopes to divert the attention of the revolutionary masses. Ha! Who will fall into your trap? Heh! Who wants your stinking money! The more "brilliant" your performance, the more imminent your complete failure! If anyone opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will thoroughly defeat them! The revolutionary rebels will unite and launch a campaign of annihilation! Crush the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and march forward forever under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!
