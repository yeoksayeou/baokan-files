Editor's Note: Revolutionary peasants have risen up in rebellion! A small clique of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, along with a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, are terrified. They have taken advantage of the year-end distribution to stir up a wind of economicism.

Today, our newspaper publishes a letter from the countryside that exposes the serious crimes of a small clique of bad elements in the suburbs of Beijing who are sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. Under the guise of "caring for the people's livelihood," they have deceived some of the masses, distributing all the public accumulations, all the reserve grains, and even the seeds. Their goal is to try to lead the rural proletarian Cultural Revolution astray into the path of economicism. However, the revolutionary peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the clearest minds and the sharpest eyes. They have launched a fierce counterattack against the wind of economicism. The revolutionary spirit of the peasants is excellent!

We hope that those who have been temporarily deceived will quickly awaken and not be fooled! Do not, for the sake of personal immediate interests, forget the collective interests, forget politics, forget class struggle, and forget to carry the proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Under the personal leadership and care of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, the proletarian Cultural Revolution in the rural areas of Beijing has already been vigorously developing. The broad masses of peasants have risen up in revolution and rebellion. The revolutionary situation in the countryside is excellent!

At this very moment, a small clique of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, unwilling to accept their defeat, have played a treacherous trick: they have taken advantage of the year-end distribution to incite some of the masses who do not understand the truth to oppose Chairman Mao's strategic line of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people, and to oppose Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. They have disregarded the actual situation of their production team and implemented a one-sided policy of less deduction and more distribution, distributing a large amount of cash and goods that should not be distributed. Their aim is to use money and material goods to buy off the masses, shift the focus of the struggle, and thereby protect themselves.

Under their incitement and planning, the following situations have already appeared in the suburbs of Beijing:

They do not reveal the family situation to the poor and lower-middle peasants, do not allow the poor and lower-middle peasants to discuss the distribution plan, but instead distribute money when there is money, distribute grain when there is grain, and distribute goods when there are goods. They have even distributed this year's seeds and feed as well as this year's production funds.

They have even distributed the grain that should be handed over to the state, the loans and deposits that should be repaid and can be repaid, and the machine cultivation fees and water and electricity fees that should be paid, either not paying or paying less, not repaying or repaying less, and one-sidedly emphasizing more eating and more distribution.

They incite the masses, saying things like "the deductions in the past were too much, and now we should reverse the case and redistribute." Some have even distributed a considerable sum of money that was saved during the initial period of the people's commune and later turned into accumulations. After distributing these accumulations, they have added the interest of several years and distributed it all. Some production teams that have not suffered heavy disasters and have not reduced production have incited the masses to use the excuse of disasters to distribute the reserve grains and reserve funds of the past.

They have even blatantly dismantled the socialist stage, wanting to distribute the original capital of the collective economy, wanting to distribute the share capital of the advanced cooperative period, the land compensation fees for state construction, and the money from the sale of property.

Can we allow their plots to succeed? No, a thousand times no, ten thousand times no! If their plots succeed, all the cash and goods of the production team will be distributed and exhausted, and next spring there will be a serious situation of having no money, no seeds, and no fertilizer.

If their plots succeed, the collective economy that the poor and lower-middle peasants have gradually consolidated and strengthened with their blood and sweat over the past decade will be destroyed!

If their plots succeed, the proletarian Cultural Revolution in the suburban countryside will be in danger of being half-hearted, and a small clique of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will continue to maintain their ruling position. They will collude with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to carry out a capitalist restoration.

The problem before us is so serious!

Now, many revolutionary peasants in the suburbs of Beijing have taken action to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and repel this wind of economicism. We urgently appeal to all the poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary organizations, revolutionary community members, and revolutionary community leaders in the entire suburbs:

1. Actively participate in the proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside, thoroughly smash economicism, repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and be a hundred times more vigilant. Do not be tempted or deceived by the enemy. Direct the struggle against a small clique of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, against a few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed.

2. Firmly carry out Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." On the one hand, actively participate in the proletarian Cultural Revolution, and on the other hand, do a good job of the current production and distribution, and arrange the life of the community members. In the matter of distribution, firmly carry out and implement Chairman Mao's instructions on preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people; on thrift in building the country, self-reliance, and hard struggle; on advocating the overall situation; and on the matter of distribution, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely fight against phenomena and behaviors that violate these instructions.

3. For those who have already made erroneous distributions, distributing this year's production funds, seeds, feed, and past accumulations of the collective, the person in charge of approving the distribution must be responsible for recovering them. (Except for the reserve grains and reserve funds that have been distributed due to serious disasters and have been agreed upon by the masses through discussion.)

4. To avoid shifting the direction of the struggle, all historical and other economic issues should be handled in principle during the later stage of the movement.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary things, if you do not beat them, they will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor. If the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." We must be a hundred times more vigilant, sharpen our eyes, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, clarify right and wrong, and see through the economic tricks of the class enemy. We must expose those who stir up trouble from behind, incite evil, and deceive the masses into leading the political struggle astray into economicism. We must overthrow, smash, and expose them! The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and all revolutionary masses and cadres in our suburbs must stand up and definitely grasp the great power of the proletarian Cultural Revolution and production and distribution in our own hands.

We believe that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have a high sense of political responsibility for consolidating the collective economy of the people's communes and for the great socialist construction of our motherland. They will definitely put "public" first and proceed from the overall interests to correctly handle the above-mentioned issues. We must also patiently do ideological and political work for those who have been temporarily deceived, helping them to clarify right and wrong and distinguish the direction. We believe that the vast majority of them will return to the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses unite, and win double victories in revolution and production!

Down with economicism!

Thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!

    打退年终分配中的经济主义妖风
　　农村来信
    编者按：革命的农民起来造反了！农村中一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子怕得要死。他们竟借年终分配的时机，刮起了一股经济主义的妖风。
    今天本报发表的农村来信，揭露了北京市郊区一小撮坏家伙破坏文化大革命的严重罪行。他们打着“关心群众生活”的招牌，蒙蔽一部分群众，分光公共积累，分光储备粮，甚至连种籽也分了。他们的目的，就是企图把农村无产阶级文化大革命引入经济主义的歧途。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命农民，心最明，眼最亮，对经济主义的妖风，发起了猛烈的反击。革命农民的这种造反精神好得很！
    我们希望那些一时受了蒙蔽的人，赶快猛醒，不要上当！不要为了个人的眼前利益，忘了集体利益，忘了政治，忘了阶级斗争，忘了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    在我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席亲自领导和关怀下，我们北京郊区农村的无产阶级文化大革命已经蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来，广大农民群众起来革命造反了。农村的革命形势好得很！
    正在这个时候，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，不甘心自己的失败，玩弄了一个阴险的花招：他们利用年终分配的机会，煽动一部分不明真相的群众，对抗毛主席关于备战备荒为人民的战略方针，对抗毛主席关于正确处理国家、集体和个人三方面的关系的指示，不顾本生产队的实际情况，实行片面的少扣多分，分掉大量不应该分配的现金和实物，企图拿金钱物质收买群众，转移斗争目标，借以保护他们自己。
    在他们的煽动和策划下，我们北京郊区已经出现了这样一些情况：
    他们不向贫下中农亮清家底，不让贫下中农讨论分配方案，而是有钱分钱，有粮分粮，有物分物，甚至把今年的种籽和饲料以及今年的生产资金都分光了。
    他们竟把应向国家交纳的公粮，应该还也可能还的贷款、定金，以及应该交的机耕费、水电费等，都不交或者少交，不还或者少还，片面强调多吃多分。
    他们煽动群众，说什么“以前的积累扣多了，现在应该翻案重分”。有的甚至把人民公社化初期提存的、后来已经转为积累的为数不小的一笔钱分掉了。分了这种积累还不够，又加算了几年的利息，一起分掉。有的生产队本来受灾不重，减产不多，他们煽动群众借口灾荒分掉以前的储备粮和储备金。
    他们还明目张胆地拆社会主义的台，竟要分掉集体经济的老本，要把高级社时期的股份基金、国家建设占地发给的占地款和变卖财产的钱统统分掉。
    我们能够容许他们的阴谋得逞吗？不能，一千个不能，一万个不能！如果他们的阴谋得逞，生产队的所有现金和实物就将被分光分净，今年一开春就会面临要钱没钱，要种没种，要肥没肥的严重局面。
    如果他们的阴谋一旦得逞，我们贫下中农十几年来用血汗逐渐巩固和壮大起来的集体经济就会被毁灭！
    如果他们的阴谋一旦得逞，郊区农村的无产阶级文化大革命就有半途而废的危险，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派就将继续维持他们的统治地位，他们就要和地富反坏右分子勾结起来，实行资本主义复辟。
    摆在我们面前的问题是多么严重啊！
    现在，北京郊区的许多革命农民已经行动起来，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，打退这股经济主义的妖风。我们向全郊区的广大贫下中农、红卫兵、各革命组织、革命的社员群众、革命的社队干部同志们紧急呼吁：
    一、积极参加农村的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎经济主义，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，百倍提高警惕，不受敌人的诱惑和欺骗，把斗争的矛头对准一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，对准极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，对准没有改造好的地富反坏右分子。
    二、坚决贯彻毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，一方面积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，一方面搞好当前的生产和分配，安排好社员的生活。在分配问题上坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的关于备战备荒为人民的指示；关于勤俭建国，自力更生，艰苦奋斗的指示；关于提倡顾全大局的指示，关于在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益、个人利益的指示。我们一定要按照毛主席的这些指示办事，坚决同违反这些指示的现象和行为作斗争。
    三、凡是已经进行了错误的分配，把今年的生产资金、种籽、饲料和以前的集体积累分掉了的，要由当权派批准者负责追回。（确实因为严重灾荒，经过群众讨论同意分掉的储备粮和储备金除外。）
    四、为了避免转移斗争大方向，凡历史遗留下来的经济问题和其他经济问题，原则上放到运动后期处理。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”我们必须百倍地提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，分清敌我，明辨是非，识破阶级敌人经济主义的阴谋诡计，把那些在背后煽阴风，点邪火，诱骗群众把政治斗争引向经济主义的坏家伙揪出来，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！我们郊区的广大贫下中农和一切革命群众、革命干部，必须挺身而出，一定要把无产阶级文化大革命的和生产的、分配的大权紧紧掌握在自己手里。
    我们相信用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大贫下中农和社员群众，对巩固人民公社集体经济，对伟大祖国的社会主义建设有高度的政治责任感。他们一定能“公”字当头，从整体利益出发，正确地处理上述问题。我们还要向那些暂时受蒙蔽的群众，耐心地进行说服教育，进行艰苦的政治思想工作，帮助他们弄清是非，明辨方向，相信他们当中的绝大多数人是会回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线方面来的。
    广大贫下中农和革命群众联合起来，夺取革命和生产的双胜利！
    打倒经济主义！
    彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
        北京市人民银行公社财务战线革命同志
        北京市郊海淀区、丰台区、朝阳区、顺
                义县、平谷县、延庆县等地区
