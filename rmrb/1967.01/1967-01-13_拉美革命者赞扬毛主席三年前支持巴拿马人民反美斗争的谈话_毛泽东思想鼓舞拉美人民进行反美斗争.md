Latin American revolutionaries praise Chairman Mao's speech three years ago supporting Panama's anti-American struggle
Mao Zedong Thought inspires Latin American people to fight against American imperialism

	LA PAZ, Jan. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivian Communist Party's organ, Liberation Daily, recently published in full Chairman Mao Zedong's speech "In Support of the Panamanian People's Just Patriotic Struggle Against American Imperialism" to commemorate the third anniversary of the speech and to express support for the Panamanian people's anti-American struggle.

	In publishing the speech, Liberation Daily emphasized the importance of Chairman Mao's speech and pointed out that the points made in the speech have been proven by the development of the situation.

	Chairman Mao's speech is widely circulated among Bolivian workers, peasants, intellectuals, and professionals.

	HAVANA, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- Two Latin American revolutionaries, on the eve of the third anniversary of Chairman Mao Zedong's speech "In Support of the Panamanian People's Just Patriotic Struggle Against American Imperialism," made statements to Xinhua News Agency, enthusiastically praising the great significance of Chairman Mao's speech.

	Panamanian writer Pablo Rochina said, "Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in this speech: 'American imperialism is rampant everywhere, placing itself in a position of enmity with all the people of the world, making itself increasingly isolated.' He went on to say that Chairman Mao's point is completely correct for the situation of our people."

	Rochina said, "The argument of revisionists who are frightened by the imperialists' nuclear blackmail is untenable, because the people of all countries know that it is the people, not the atomic bomb as the imperialists shout, that decide the outcome of the war."

	Honduran revolutionary Jorge Federico said, "In January 1964, when the bloody suppression of the Panamanian people occurred, Chairman Mao issued a speech supporting the Panamanian people. He pointed out: 'Comrade Mao Zedong, on behalf of the Chinese people, condemns American imperialism and supports the Panamanian people's voice, which was heard at the most needed time. This shows the generous Chinese people and their great leader's support for the Latin American people.'"

	He believed that this is the support of Mao Zedong Thought for the people of all countries who are fighting to break free from American slavery. He expressed, "I sincerely believe that this support is a true example for all Marxist-Leninists on this continent."

    拉美革命者赞扬毛主席三年前支持巴拿马人民反美斗争的谈话 
    毛泽东思想鼓舞拉美人民进行反美斗争
    玻共机关报全文发表毛主席这个具有历史意义的文件
    新华社十二日讯　拉巴斯消息：玻利维亚共产党机关报《解放报》为了纪念毛泽东主席《支持巴拿马人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》发表三周年和表示支持巴拿马人民的反美斗争，最近全文刊登了这篇有历史意义的谈话。
    《解放报》在发表这篇谈话时强调了毛主席上述谈话的重要意义，并且指出，毛主席谈话中的论点已经为形势的发展所证实。
    毛主席的这篇谈话，正在玻利维亚工人、农民、知识界人士和自由职业者中间广泛传播着。
    新华社哈瓦那十一日电　两位拉丁美洲革命者在毛主席《支持巴拿马人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》发表三周年的前夕，向新华社记者发表声明，热情赞扬毛主席这篇谈话的伟大意义。
    巴拿马作家巴勃罗·罗奇卡说，毛泽东同志在这篇谈话中明确指出：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。”他接着说，毛主席的这一论点对于我国人民的情况来说是完全正确的。
    罗奇卡说，被帝国主义的原子讹诈吓坏了的修正主义者的论点是站不住脚的，因为世界各国人民知道，对战争起决定作用的是人民，而不是像帝国主义者所叫嚷的那样，是原子弹。
    洪都拉斯革命者豪尔赫·费德里科说，在一九六四年一月发生血腥镇压巴拿马人民的事件的时候，毛主席发表了支持巴拿马人民的谈话。他指出：“毛泽东同志代表全中国人民谴责美帝国主义和支持巴拿马人民的声音是在最需要的时候听到的，这表现了慷慨的中国人民及其伟大领袖对拉丁美洲人民的声援。”
    他认为，这是毛泽东思想对于正在为摆脱美国奴役而斗争的各国人民的支持。他表示：“我衷心地相信，这一支持对本大陆所有马克思列宁主义者来说，是一个真正的范例。”
