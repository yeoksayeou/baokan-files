Laotian People Achieve Great Victories in Anti-American Struggle
Defeated American Imperialists and Their Running Dogs in Over Ten Attacks Last Year, Annihilating More Than Ten Thousand Enemies
Souphanouvong Calls for Doubling Efforts to Strike American Aggressors in the New Year

Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut
According to the Pathet Lao radio broadcast: Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Vice Premier of the Lao Three-Party National Unity Government, Prince Souphanouvong, wrote a letter on the 1st to the people, cadres, and soldiers of Laos, warmly congratulating the New Year. In his letter, Prince Souphanouvong called on the people of Laos to continue to carry forward the tradition of heroic struggle in the new year, determined to defeat the American aggressors, and strive to build a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

The letter states: "1966 marked the comprehensive strengthening of the revolutionary forces and various patriotic forces of the Lao people, and also marked the heavy military and political defeats suffered by American imperialism and its running dogs in their intensified aggression against our country. Our military and people defeated the enemy's more than ten incursions into the liberated areas, repulsed the enemy's hundreds of large-scale 'sweeps,' annihilated and disintegrated more than ten thousand of the enemy's forces, shot down 192 American aggressor aircraft, and damaged dozens more. Not only did we defend and consolidate the liberated areas, but we also expanded them. The life in the liberated areas is getting better and better, and there has been all-around progress. These are the great achievements of our military and people in 1966. This victory is a manifestation of the indomitable spirit and determination of our military and people to defeat the American aggressors, which is an invincible force that no reactionary force can overcome."

The letter states, "American imperialism and its running dogs have suffered heavy defeats, but they are still unwilling to give up their aggressive ambitions against Laos. They may engage in even more dangerous military adventurism in 1967, which will make our struggle more intense and brutal. However, as long as we, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, actively carry forward the tradition of heroic struggle, strengthen unity among all nationalities, closely coordinate with the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression for national salvation, and obtain the sympathy and support of the peace-loving and justice-seeking people of the world, the just struggle of our people will certainly achieve brilliant victories, and American imperialism and its running dogs will surely suffer a shameful defeat."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khamkeut, January 5th
According to the Pathet Lao radio broadcast: The patriotic military and people of Vientiane Province bravely smashed the attacks and "sweeps" of the American running dogs' army in 1966, achieving brilliant results.

In the past year, the patriotic military and people of Vientiane Province conducted more than 280 battles, annihilating 2,318 enemies, completely annihilating five enemy companies, and severely damaging three battalions of rightist-controlled bandit forces. They liberated 187 villages with a population of over 20,000.

    老挝人民反美斗争取得巨大胜利
    去年打败美帝及其走狗成十次进攻，歼灭敌人万余  苏发努冯号召在新的一年加倍打击美国强盗
    新华社康开电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席、老挝三方民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王，一日写信给老挝全国人民、干部和战士，热烈祝贺新年。苏发努冯亲王在信中号召老挝全国人民在新的一年里继续发扬英勇斗争传统，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，为建设一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝而奋斗。
    信中说：“一九六六年标志着老挝人民革命力量和各种爱国力量的全面壮大，同时也标志着美帝国主义及其走狗在加强对我国的侵略战争中，在军事上和政治上的惨重失败。我国军民打败了敌人对解放区发动的成十次蚕食进攻，击溃了敌人成百次大规模‘扫荡’，消灭和瓦解敌人一万多名，击落美国强盗飞机一百九十二架，击伤几十架。不但保卫和巩固了解放区，而且还使解放区得到扩大。解放区的生活越来越好，同时有了全面的进步。这是我国军民在一九六六年中取得的巨大成绩。这一胜利是我国军民的英勇不屈的精神和打败美国侵略强盗的决心的表现，这是任何反动势力都战胜不了的。”
    信中说，“美帝国主义及其走狗已经遭到了惨重的失败，但它们还是不肯放弃对老挝的侵略野心。它们可能在一九六七年里，更加疯狂地进行危险的军事冒险活动，这将会使我们的斗争更为激烈和残酷。但是，只要我们在老挝爱国战线党领导下，积极发扬英勇斗争的传统，加强各个民族之间的团结一致，同英勇的兄弟的越南人民的抗美救国斗争紧密地配合，同时得到世界上热爱和平和主持正义的人民的同情和支持，我国人民的正义斗争必将取得辉煌的胜利，美帝国主义及其走狗必将遭到可耻的失败。”
    据新华社康开五日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝万象省爱国军民在一九六六年英勇地粉碎了美国走狗军队的进攻和“扫荡”，取得了辉煌的战果。
    在过去一年里，万象省爱国军民连续进行了二百八十多次战斗，歼敌两千三百十八人，其中全歼敌人五个连和重创右派控制的土匪武装三个营，解放了拥有两万多人口的一百八十七个村庄。
