Our great leader Chairman Mao's new directive to "practice frugality for revolution" was immediately met with enthusiastic support from the revolutionary rebels, workers, and students in the capital. They said: Chairman Mao, on the eve of our nation's victory, at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, warned us to be vigilant against the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets. Now, at this critical moment when the revolutionary masses are uniting to seize power from the capitalist roaders, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued the great call to "practice frugality for revolution." This is the sharpest and most powerful ideological weapon for us revolutionary rebels to resist the corruption of economism, to smash the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and to maintain the glorious tradition of hard struggle and the steadfastness of the proletarian revolution.

On January 26, our newspaper invited some revolutionary rebel workers and students to discuss Chairman Mao's new directive and the editorial "Practice Frugality for Revolution, Protect State Property." Below is the summary of the discussion:

A red rebel from Beijing First Machine Tool Factory said: The proletarian revolutionary rebels, in response to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, have formed great alliances and seized power from the capitalist roaders. The situation is excellent. We revolutionary rebels have just taken power, and if we are not careful, it is easy to make economistic mistakes. At this moment, Chairman Mao timely instructs us: "Practice frugality for revolution." We red rebels who have taken power must maintain the proletarian style of hard work and simplicity, and thoroughly smash the bureaucratic style of the bourgeoisie. The capitalist roaders squander state property at will; we will not follow their example. We must study the "Three Articles" thoroughly, smash the "self" and establish the "public," and resolutely unite with the workers, diligently serving the people.

A revolutionary worker from Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory said: Practicing frugality for revolution is an important directive from Chairman Mao to us revolutionary rebels, a directive that is crucial to the success of the proletarian cultural revolution. We must follow this directive. We must break with sentiment, adhere to principles, and not trade political principles. We must vigorously promote the spirit of "practicing frugality for revolution, protecting state property," and let everyone cherish state property.

I live in a small room, which is quite cramped. Someone suggested, "Why don't you ask for a bigger room?" I thought, Chairman Mao teaches us to care for others first. Three-quarters of the world's people are still not liberated, and many people still do not have a place to live. I already have a place to live, so I should not ask for more. We workers must think comprehensively and consider the overall situation.

Another old worker from Guanghua Timber Factory said: The capitalist roaders issued excessive wages, with some getting a thousand and others getting hundreds, and then rushed to the market to buy things. We old workers were very angry to see this.

Chairman Mao, as early as when the nation was about to be liberated, taught us to be frugal and not to be hit by the sugar-coated bullets. After liberation, some people did not follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and as a result, they were hit by the enemy's sugar-coated bullets.

Now, Chairman Mao, at the time when we revolutionary rebels are about to achieve victory, has issued the great call: "Practice frugality for revolution," again sounding the alarm for us. We must remember this teaching, practice frugality for revolution, and manage all affairs thriftily.

After our factory seized power, mainly due to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the revolutionary rebel workers, production immediately increased. Not only did we not reduce production, but we doubled it. This is what Chairman Mao said, that spirit can become a great material force.

We smashed the old production management system, eliminated cumbersome procedures, and had the Revolutionary Production Committee manage production, abolishing the one-man management system and avoiding bureaucratism and subjectivism. Previously, dozens of people who sat in offices are now mostly working in the factory, increasing the workforce on the production frontline.

In the future, we revolutionary rebel workers will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, practice frugality for revolution, focus on production, consolidate power, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

A red rebel from Beijing Crane Factory said: We revolutionary rebels, who were previously suppressed, have now seized power and stood up straight, which might lead to the thought that we should enjoy some comfort. This thought is unacceptable.

The capitalist roaders squandered a large amount of state funds. If we do not increase production and practice frugality, and squander like them, that would be changing the soup but not the medicine.

The capitalist roaders' power has been seized, but their hearts are not dead, and their reactionary forces have not dispersed. They will still spread poisonous winds and ignite ghost fires. Some people raise the banner of "rebellion" but secretly use small favors to win hearts. For example, in our factory, there was talk of compensating for haircut fees, six jiao per person, generously spending state funds. We say, economism be damned, who wants your stinking money! Our factory's clinic previously made it difficult for sick rebel workers to get treatment, showing no class feelings. Someone had a fever of 39 degrees, and they did not care. After we seized power, they changed their attitude. Whoever went to ask for leave was given a sick note, actually letting the workers off work, and they used this method to sabotage production. We must see through their tricks and repel their attacks.

A revolutionary worker from Beijing First Machine Tool Factory said: "Practice frugality for revolution" is the alarm bell our great leader Chairman Mao sounded for us at this critical moment, a measure to judge whether we are truly revolutionary rebels. After the proletarian revolutionary rebels seized power, we must consciously implement this great directive and never, because we have taken power, casually ride in cars, buy whatever we want, and squander state wealth. We must be vigilant against the bourgeoisie using sugar-coated bullets to corrupt the revolutionary will of the revolutionary rebels. If we go against Chairman Mao's great directive, we will stagnate, become the target of the revolution, and be overthrown by the revolutionary masses. Whoever wants to be a thorough proletarian revolutionary must arm themselves with Chairman Mao's great directive, always pay attention to frugality, and cherish state wealth. Some revolutionary organizations in our factory did well. They enthusiastically promoted Mao Zedong Thought. Without a mimeograph machine, they found a glass plate and a roller with ink, and started printing propaganda materials. What they did completely conforms to Chairman Mao's directive. Think about it, the old Red Army fought the revolution with rice and rifles, defeating the vicious enemy. In those hard times, where was there a mimeograph machine? We must learn from the example of the old Red Army, always maintain the proletarian style of hard work and simplicity, and never slide into the bourgeois path of showing off, flaunting wealth, and extravagant spending!

A cadre from Guanghua Timber Factory said: Chairman Mao taught us ten years ago: "Among our many cadres, there is a dangerous tendency to avoid sharing the hardships with the masses and to be concerned with personal fame and gain. This is very bad. In the production and frugality movement, we demand the streamlining of organizations and the transfer of cadres, so that a considerable number of cadres return to production, which is a method to overcome this dangerous tendency." Frugality is the essence of the proletariat, and we must always maintain this essence. After the editorial "Practice Frugality for Revolution, Protect State Property" was published, I strongly supported it.

From the large number of facts revealed by the proletarian cultural revolution, it can be seen that the handful of capitalist roaders within the party were hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie, starting from corruption and decadence in their lives.

We proletarian revolutionary rebels must always remember Chairman Mao's great directive, be vigilant against the invasion of extravagant and wasteful thoughts at any time, and if there is even a slight sign of it, we must overcome it in time and never let it grow.

A soldier from "Red Flag" of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics expressed at the discussion meeting: We students who went down to the factories must learn from the workers, unite with the workers, and maintain a hardworking and simple working style. We do not need anything. The dormitory is our office. During the day, we roll up our bedding and write big-character posters, and we still make the revolution.

A comrade from Beijing Cotton Mill No. 1 said: The power of the capitalist roaders within the party has been seized by us, but their forces have not dispersed. Some people raise the banner of "rebellion" but engage in activities that sabotage production. Originally, each person operated two machines, and the labor intensity was not great, but they incited some deceived masses to rebel against the high labor intensity, demanding that each person operate only one machine, putting pressure on the rebel workers. We rebels must take the lead in working. If they do not work, we will. One person can do the work of two. Some people use work time to go to the clinic for "treatment." In fact, most people are not sick; it is just that the "protectionist" doctors issue sick notes indiscriminately, trying to use legal means to fight against us revolutionary rebels. Some people treat state property as collective property and turn it into private property. We must firmly oppose all these.

When we were suppressed, we struggled hard. Now that we have risen up and taken power, some people seek comfort, enjoy luxuries, and demand this and that, the more the better. We must resolutely stop this trend and not let it corrupt the revolutionary masses. We revolutionary rebels not only want to be pioneers of the revolution but also want to be models of production and champions of frugality.

    坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召
　　节约闹革命
　　——首都革命造反派工人、学生座谈纪要
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席“要节约闹革命”的新指示一发出，立即得到首都广大革命造反派工人和学生的热烈拥护。他们说：毛主席在全国胜利前夕，在党的七届二中全会上，曾经告诫我们：要警惕资产阶级的糖衣炮弹；现在，在无产阶级革命派联合起来，夺走资本主义道路的当权派的权的关键时刻，伟大领袖毛主席又发出了“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，这是我们革命造反派用以抵抗经济主义的腐蚀，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，保持艰苦奋斗的光荣传统和无产阶级革命的坚定性的最锐利最强大的思想武器。
    本报在一月二十六日邀请了部分革命造反派工人和学生座谈了毛主席的新指示和本报社论《节约闹革命，保护国家财产》。下面是座谈纪要：
    北京第一机床厂一位红色造反者说：无产阶级革命造反派响应毛主席和党中央的号召，实行大联合，从走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺过权来，形势大好。我们革命造反派刚刚掌握大权，稍不注意，很容易犯经济主义的错误。就在这个时候，毛主席及时地指示我们：“要节约闹革命”。我们掌权的红色造反者，一定保持无产阶级艰苦朴素的作风，彻底打倒资产阶级官老爷作风。走资本主义道路的官老爷任意挥霍浪费国家财物，我们决不学他们那一套。我们要好好学习“老三篇”，打倒“私”字，立起“公”字，坚决和工人打成一片，勤勤恳恳地做人民的勤务员。
    北京光华木材厂一位革命工人说：节约闹革命，是毛主席对我们革命造反派的一个重要指示，是关系到能不能闹好无产阶级文化大革命的重要指示，我们一定要遵照这个指示去办。要打破情面，要掌握原则，不能拿政治原则作交易。我们一定要大力宣传“节约闹革命，保护国家财产”的精神，让大家都来珍惜国家的财产。
    我住的是一间小房子，比较挤，有人说，你去要一间大房吧！我想，毛主席教导我们要首先关心别人，全世界还有三分之二的人没有解放，很多人还住不上房子。我已经有房子住，就不该要了。我们工人一定要想到全面，要顾全大局。
    光华木材厂另一位老工人说：走资本主义道路的当权派，滥发工资，这个一千，那个几百，到市场上去抢购，我们老工人看了非常气愤。
    毛主席早在全国快要解放的时候，就教导我们要艰苦朴素，不要被糖衣炮弹打中了。解放后，有那么一些人，不照毛主席的指示去办，结果就中了敌人的糖衣炮弹。
    现在，毛主席在我们革命造反派要取得胜利的时候，又发出了伟大号召：“要节约闹革命”，又一次向我们敲响了警钟。我们一定要记住这个教导，节约闹革命，勤俭办一切事业。
    我们厂夺权后，主要由于革命造反派工人发挥了革命干劲，生产马上就上来了，不但没有减产，而且翻了一番。这就是毛主席说的，精神能够变成巨大的物质力量。
    我们打烂了过去的办工管制度，省去烦琐手续，由生产革命委员会管理生产，废除了一长制，避免了官僚主义和主观主义。过去坐办公室的几十个人，现在大部分都下厂了，增加了生产第一线的人力。
    今后，我们革命造反派工人，一定要听毛主席的话，节约闹革命，抓好生产，巩固政权，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    北京起重机厂一位红色造反者说：我们革命造反派，过去受压制，现在夺权了，直起腰来了，可能会产生这种思想：该我们宽裕宽裕了。这种思想要不得。
    走资本主义道路的当权派，大量挥霍国家钱财。我们要是不增产节约，跟他们一样，也大量挥霍，那就是换汤不换药。
    走资本主义道路的当权派，他们的权虽然被夺了，但是心不死，他们的反动势力还不散，还会刮阴风，点鬼火。有的打起“造反”的旗号，背地里用小恩小惠笼络人心。比如我们厂里就有什么补退理发费，每人六角，大慷国家之慨。我们说，经济主义见鬼去吧，谁要你的臭钱！我们厂的卫生所，过去对生病的造反派工人百般刁难，没有一点阶级感情，有人发烧到三十九度，他们都不管。我们夺权后，他们一反常态，谁要去请假，都给开假条子，实际上把工人都放走了，他们就是用这样的办法来破坏生产。我们一定要识破他们的阴谋，打退他们的进攻。
    北京第一机床厂一位革命工人说：“要节约闹革命”，是我们伟大领袖毛主席在关键的时刻，给我们敲起的警钟，是衡量是不是真正革命造反派的尺子。我们无产阶级革命派夺权以后，更要自觉地执行这个伟大的指示，决不能因为掌握了大权，就随便坐小汽车，想用什么就买什么，挥霍国家的财富。我们要谨防资产阶级用糖衣炮弹来腐蚀革命造反派的革命意志。如果违背毛主席这个伟大指示，我们就会停顿起来，成为革命的对象，就会被革命的群众所推翻。谁要想做一个彻底的无产阶级革命派，就必须用毛主席这个伟大指示武装自己的头脑，时时刻刻都要注意节约，爱惜国家的财富。我们厂有的革命组织就做得好。他们热情地宣传毛泽东思想，没有油印机，就弄一块玻璃板，找一个油墨滚，就印起了宣传品。他们这样做完全符合毛主席的指示。想一想，老红军闹革命，还不是小米加步枪，打败了凶恶的敌人，在那个艰苦的时候，那里有什么油印机？我们要学习老红军的榜样，始终保持无产阶级的艰苦朴素的本色，千万不要滑到资产阶级那种讲排场、摆阔气、铺张浪费的邪路上去！
    光华木材厂一位革命造反派的干部说：毛主席早在十年前就教导我们：“在我们的许多工作人员中间，现在滋长着一种不愿意和群众同甘苦，喜欢计较个人名利的危险倾向，这是很不好的。我们在增产节约运动中要求精简机关，下放干部，使相当大的一批干部回到生产中去，就是克服这种危险倾向的一个方法。”勤俭节约是我们无产阶级的本色，我们要永远保持这个本色。《节约闹革命，保护国家财产》社论发表后，我非常非常地拥护。
    从无产阶级文化大革命揭露的大量事实中可以看出，那一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，很多是被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹打中的，是从生活上腐化堕落开始的。
    我们无产阶级革命造反派，要时刻牢记毛主席这个伟大指示，随时警惕铺张浪费思想对我们的袭击，那怕有了一点不好的苗头，也要及时克服，决不能任其滋长。
    北航“红旗”的一名下厂战士在座谈会上表示：我们下厂的造反学生，要向工人学习，和工人结合，保持艰苦朴素的工作作风。我们什么也不要。宿舍就是我们的办公室，白天铺盖一卷就能写大字报，照样闹革命。
    京棉一厂一位革命造反派的同志说：党内走资本主义道路的当权派的权被我们夺过来了，但他们的势力不散，有的人打着“造反”的旗号，干着破坏生产的勾当。本来每人看两台车，劳动强度并不大，可是他们却煽动一些受蒙蔽的群众起来造劳动强度大的反，要求每人只开一台车，给造反派工人施加压力。我们造反派要带头干，他们不干我们干，一个人顶两个人。还有一些人利用上班时间去医务室“看病”。其实，大多数人并没有病，就是因为“保”字派大夫乱开条子，想通过合法手段来同我们革命造反派斗争。还有的人把国家财产当成集体财产，变成私人财产，这些我们都要坚决反对。
    我们造反派，在受压制的时候，艰苦奋斗，现在翻身了，掌权了，有的人就贪图安逸，讲究排场，伸手要这要那，越多越好。我们要坚决刹住这股风，不让它腐蚀革命群众。我们革命造反派不但要做革命的闯将，也要做生产的模范，做节约的标兵。
