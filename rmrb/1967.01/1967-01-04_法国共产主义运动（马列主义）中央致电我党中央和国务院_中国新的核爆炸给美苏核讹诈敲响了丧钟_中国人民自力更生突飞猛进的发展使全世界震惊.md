	The Central Committee of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) has sent a cable to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, congratulating China on the successful conduct of a new nuclear test.

	The cable says:

	"The Central Committee of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) extends warm congratulations to the Communist Party of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the complete success of this test. This test has greatly infuriated the various imperialists led by U.S. imperialism and the various modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionists.

	"This test, conducted during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has achieved tremendous success, proving that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only does not hinder the development of science, technology, and the economy, but on the contrary, is preparing a new great leap forward in all fields.

	"The Chinese atomic energy scientists, technicians, and workers, by following the precious teachings of Mao Zedong Thought and relying on their own efforts, have achieved rapid development, shocking the world. The United States and the Soviet Union, however, have had to conduct hundreds of various tests.

	"Therefore, the success of this major test has made China a nuclear power, sounding the death knell for the nuclear blackmail of the United States and the Soviet Union.

	"From now on, the peoples of the world will have the support of China's prestige and powerful, decisive influence in their struggle for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons throughout the world.

	"This is why the Central Committee of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) is extremely pleased with all the achievements of the People's Republic of China in the nuclear field, especially the success of the fifth test conducted on December 28, 1966."

    法国共产主义运动（马列主义）中央致电我党中央和国务院
    中国新的核爆炸给美苏核讹诈敲响了丧钟
    中国人民自力更生突飞猛进的发展使全世界震惊
    新华社三日讯　中共中央和国务院收到了法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会书记弗朗索瓦·马尔蒂发来的祝贺我国成功地进行新的核爆炸的电报。
    贺电说，法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会“就这次试验的圆满成功，向中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府致以热烈的祝贺。这次试验使以美帝国主义为首的各式各样的帝国主义者和以苏联修正主义者为首的形形色色的现代修正主义者大为恼火。
      “这次在无产阶级文化大革命中进行的试验所取得的巨大成功证明了，无产阶级文化大革命不仅不妨碍科学、技术和经济的发展，恰恰相反，它正在为各个领域内的一个新的大跃进作好准备。
      “中国原子能科学家、技术人员和劳动者正是由于遵循毛泽东思想的宝贵教导，自力更生，才取得了突飞猛进的发展而使全世界震惊，而美国和苏联却不得不进行几百次的各种试验。
    “因此，这次重大试验的成功已使中国成为核大国，给美苏两国的核讹诈敲响了丧钟。
    “世界各国人民从今以后就有了中国的威望和威力巨大的和有决定性的支援，来争取在全世界全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器。
    “这就是为什么法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）中央委员会，对于中华人民共和国在核领域中的一切成就，特别是一九六六年十二月二十八日第五次试验的成功，感到万分高兴。”
