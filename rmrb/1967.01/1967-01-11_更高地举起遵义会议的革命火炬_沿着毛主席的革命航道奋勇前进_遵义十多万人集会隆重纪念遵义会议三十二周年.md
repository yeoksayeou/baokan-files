More than 100,000 people in Zunyi gathered for a grand meeting to solemnly commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the Zunyi Conference, enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Guiyang on the 10th, more than 100,000 revolutionary masses from Zunyi, as well as revolutionary students and Red Guards from all over the country who walked to Zunyi, held a grand rally on the morning of the 8th to solemnly commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the Zunyi Conference, enthusiastically celebrating the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

In January 1935, during the Long March of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the army entered Zunyi and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, held an expanded meeting of the Central Political Bureau from January 6th to 8th. This is the famous Zunyi Conference. This conference established the leadership position of our most beloved and respected great leader, Chairman Mao, in the entire Party and the entire army, and at the most critical juncture, saved the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. After the Zunyi Conference, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao and guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese revolution has always moved from victory to victory.

On this day, the revolutionary historical city of Zunyi, which is in the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was decorated with lanterns and banners, and red flags were flying. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao," the sound of drums, firecrackers, and revolutionary songs echoed all day. Workers, commune members, Red Guards, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres participating in the meeting, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations, and carrying red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," arrived at the venue before dawn from all directions. Many of them came specially from Guiyang and neighboring counties. Tens of thousands of Red Guards who walked from all over the country to form the Long March Connection Team, each full of spirit, marched into the venue and were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses.

The meeting began with the solemn music of "The East Is Red," and the entire audience read quotations from Chairman Mao. Red Guards, the Long March Connection Team, workers, peasants, and old Red Army representatives then spoke, sincerely wishing our great leader, Chairman Mao, eternal life and enthusiastically celebrating the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They said in reviewing the road of the Chinese revolution that the 32 years since the Zunyi Conference have been 32 years of victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. History has proven that the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people can only thrive and develop under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought; whenever it deviates from Mao Zedong Thought, it will suffer setbacks and fail. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution also proves this truth. They declared with great enthusiasm that they would resolutely hold high the torch of the Zunyi Conference, advance bravely along the revolutionary course charted by Chairman Mao, follow Chairman Mao for a lifetime of revolution; to thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

At the end of the memorial meeting, the entire audience sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman." In the evening, various cultural performances praising the great leader Chairman Mao were staged.

    更高地举起遵义会议的革命火炬 
    沿着毛主席的革命航道奋勇前进
    遵义十多万人集会隆重纪念遵义会议三十二周年
    据新华社贵阳十日电　遵义市革命群众以及全国各地步行到遵义的革命师生和红卫兵小将十多万人，八日上午举行盛大集会，隆重纪念遵义会议三十二周年，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    一九三五年一月，中国工农红军长征途中进驻遵义时，在毛主席领导下，于一月六日到八日在这里召开了扩大的中央政治局会议，这就是举世闻名的遵义会议。这次会议确立了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在全党全军的领导地位，在最危急的关头挽救了中国人民的革命事业。遵义会议以后，在以毛主席为首的党中央的领导下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，中国革命就一直从胜利走向胜利。
    八日这天，正处在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中的革命历史名城遵义，到处张灯结彩，红旗飘扬，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声、锣鼓声、鞭炮声和革命歌声整日不绝。参加大会的工人、农村人民公社社员、红卫兵小将、革命师生和革命干部，高举着毛主席画像和语录牌，拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，天不亮就从四面八方拥向会场。他们中有许多人是从贵阳和邻近各县专程赶来的。来自全国各地的数万名步行串连长征队红卫兵，个个精神焕发，列队进入会场，受到了革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    大会在《东方红》的庄严乐曲声中开始，全场朗读毛主席语录。红卫兵、步行长征队、工人、农民和老红军的代表接着讲话，他们由衷地祝愿伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆，热烈欢呼毛主席革命路线的胜利。他们在回顾中国革命经历的道路时说，遵义会议后的三十二年，是毛主席革命路线胜利的三十二年。历史证明，中国人民的革命事业，只有在毛泽东思想的指引下，才能兴旺发展；什么时候违背了毛泽东思想，就要遭受挫折，就要失败。当前的无产阶级文化大革命同样证明了这一真理。他们满怀激情地宣告：决心高举遵义会议的火炬，沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道奋勇前进，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命；要彻底砸烂资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    纪念大会结束时，全场高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。晚上，演出了歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的各种文娱节目。
