Indian government employees and students continue their struggle against oppression and for survival.

According to reports from the Indian press, 500,000 government employees in the state of Uttar Pradesh have been on an indefinite strike since December 7, 1966. As of January 3, 1967, they have been on strike for 28 days. The reactionary Indian government has responded with mass arrests, suspensions, and dismissals, brutally suppressing and persecuting them. Reports indicate that over the past few days alone, more than 2,500 employees have been arrested since December 30, 1966. However, this brutal suppression and persecution have only united the angry employees, making them more determined to fight against the reactionary government. They have been demonstrating daily in front of the government offices in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. On December 30, 1966, the reactionary government arrested over 700 employees. The outraged employees, carrying black flags and chanting slogans against the reactionary government, demonstrated and smashed the offices of the commissioner, the electricity department, the education department, and the supply department with stones. On January 3, 1967, over 5,000 employees and police clashed repeatedly in Lucknow, resisting the police's mass arrests of the demonstrators. The demonstrators reiterated their determination to continue the strike until their demands are met.

Over 10,000 employees of the electricity department in Maharashtra state have stopped working since January 2, 1967, demanding a wage increase.

Approximately 100,000 government employees in Himachal Pradesh will organize large-scale demonstrations and marches on January 5, 1967, in Shimla, the state capital, and various district headquarters, demanding a wage increase.

Students in Bihar state are engaged in a large-scale protest against the reactionary Indian government's shooting of professors and students in Muzzafarpur last December.

In Muzzafarpur, over 10,000 teachers and students held a large-scale hunger strike from morning to evening on January 3, 1967, protesting the police's shooting of demonstrators on December 10, 1966. Students and teachers in Ranchi and several other towns in the state also held demonstrations, protesting the government's suppression.

In Sharif, students and teachers carried black flags and chanted slogans against the reactionary government on January 2, 1967, demonstrating and setting fire to the local Congress Party building.
