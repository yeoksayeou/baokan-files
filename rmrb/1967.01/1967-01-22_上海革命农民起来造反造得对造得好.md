Revolutionary masses across the country enthusiastically hail the rise of the Shanghai peasant revolution

Shanghai revolutionary peasants rise up in rebellion, and they are right to do so, and they do it well.

Revolutionary workers, students, intellectuals, and cadres express: We must resolutely unite with the revolutionary peasants to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a more profound and broader new stage. Revolutionary peasants across the country express: We must learn from the Shanghai revolutionary peasants, and launch a fierce struggle against a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party, against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and against the capitalist reactionary line. We must repel the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," so that the peasant revolutionary movement advances victoriously along the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st—The second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" jointly issued by the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Peasants' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, along with relevant editorials from the "Wenhui Daily" and the "Liberation Daily," have sparked strong responses among revolutionary workers, peasants, students, intellectuals, and cadres in Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xi'an, and Chengdu. They hail the Shanghai peasant revolutionary movement as the signal for the victory march of the peasant revolutionary movement across the country. Revolutionary workers, students, intellectuals, and cadres in various places express their most resolute support for the peasant revolutionary movement and their determination to unite with the revolutionary peasants to push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to a more profound and broader new stage. Broad masses of revolutionary peasants in various places express their determination to learn from the example of the Shanghai revolutionary peasants, actively join the revolutionary torrent, launch a fierce struggle against a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party, against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and against the capitalist reactionary line. They will repel the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," so that the peasant revolutionary movement advances victoriously along the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao.

Revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and cadres in the capital, who are implementing the great alliance of revolutionary rebels and launching a fierce attack on counter-revolutionary economism, enthusiastically hail the issuance of the second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" and the rise of the Shanghai peasant revolutionary movement. People are spreading the news and rejoicing, saying that this is a big event that will definitely have a great impact on the peasant revolutionary movement across the country. It's great! It's very good! Revolutionary peasants from the Dongsheng People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing, after reading the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai," conducted a study session and discussion. They excitedly said, "The Shanghai peasants have risen up in rebellion! Their rebellion is right, and it is well done. They have spoken for us. We resolutely support their revolutionary actions, closely follow them, and unite with all revolutionary rebels in the city to sweep away the capitalism-roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and crush the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. Some poor and lower-middle peasants and Red Guards from the Chengguan Commune in Tongxian County said: A handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party and stubborn elements adhering to the capitalist reactionary line are blind and foolish, trying to buy us off with counter-revolutionary economism. This is a daydream. They expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao in making revolution forever. Some members of the Dongfanghong Commune at the Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Factory said, "Five hundred million peasants are our most reliable and broadest allies. The rise of the peasant revolutionary movement will definitely have a great impact on the entire Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We revolutionary workers will resolutely unite with the revolutionary peasants, strengthen the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen proletarian dictatorship, and seize power from a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party, firmly grasping the political, economic, and cultural power in our own hands. Some students from nine revolutionary organizations, including the Red Flag Combat Team of Beijing Aviation Institute, the Dongfanghong Commune of Beijing Mechanical Institute, and the "August 18" Red Guards of Beijing Medical College, hailed this as the prelude to the storm of the peasant revolutionary movement! They said, the rise of the peasant revolutionary movement has fiercely impacted a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party and severely struck the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They expressed their determination to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, humbly learn from the revolutionary rebels fighting in Shanghai, and resolutely fight alongside the worker-peasant masses to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Revolutionary rebel workers from the Tianjin Dyeing and Chemical Factory No. 2 hailed the rise of the peasant revolutionary movement, saying it will definitely make a great contribution to the great cause of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They expressed their determination to support the peasant revolutionary movement and to unite more closely with the revolutionary peasants under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and cadres in the Guangzhou region enthusiastically hailed the second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai." Revolutionary peasants from the Shi Jing area in the suburbs of Guangzhou, after carefully studying the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai," hailed the new victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The warriors of the "Red Farmer Friends" headquarters said: The rise of the peasant movement is an inevitable trend, and no force can stop it. Chairman Mao supports us, the worker big brothers support us, and the revolutionary teachers and students support us. Our revolutionary peasants have a sturdier backbone. We must learn well from the worker big brothers and the Red Guard youths, fight shoulder to shoulder with them, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line. Revolutionary rebel workers from the Guangzhou Paper Mill said, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are our most reliable allies. We and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants unite, and no force can break us or destroy us. They expressed their determination to support the struggle of the peasant revolutionary rebels with actual actions. The two largest revolutionary rebel student organizations in Guangzhou issued articles expressing that revolutionary students must, under the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, live, work, and unite with the poor and lower-middle peasants, uproot revisionism, and smash the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line.

Yesterday evening, loudspeakers in many factories, schools, and neighborhoods in Shenyang repeatedly broadcasted the second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" and the relevant editorials from the "Wenhui Daily" and the "Liberation Daily." Revolutionary rebel organizations posted slogans expressing resolute support for the peasant revolutionary movement, and some held symposiums, enthusiastically hailing the rise of the Shanghai peasant revolutionary movement. Revolutionary warriors from the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards Hard-Bone Rebel Headquarters in Shenyang expressed at the symposium that revolutionary workers must be models of "grasp revolution, promote production," and vow to be the backbone of revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants, joining hands with them to resolutely repel the new counterattacks of the capitalist reactionary line in cities and countryside, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in every corner of cities and countryside. Revolutionary rebel members from the Dongfeng Production Brigade of the Wusan People's Commune in the suburbs of Shenyang said: Great leader Chairman Mao has long said that we peasants are the most reliable allies of the working class. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade resolutely unite with workers and students, launch a fierce struggle against a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party, against a small number of stubborn elements adhering to the capitalist reactionary line, and against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. When we rise up in rebellion, those bad elements are afraid and learn counter-revolutionary revisionist economism from the bad elements in the cities. They spread rumors saying, "Rebelling means no work points," and they distribute early to some people, saying, "Spend the money and then settle accounts with the rebels," trying to disrupt the revolution with these tricks. Their calculations are wrong; we are the new peasants who listen to Chairman Mao the most, and the economic wind cannot blind our eyes. Now our brigade is in the autumn harvest distribution, and we broad masses of commune members, after discussion, have resolutely highlighted proletarian politics and correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the commune members. We must resolutely unite with the revolutionary rebel workers, students, and cadres, and defeat a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party and stubborn elements adhering to the capitalist reactionary line, making the revolutionary rebel poor and lower-middle peasants grasp the power of the production brigade. The Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel Team of Shenyang Agricultural College sent people to the countryside more than two months ago to investigate the class struggle in the countryside and combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants. A comrade from this revolutionary rebel team said: The rise of the peasant movement is an inevitable trend in the deepening development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It will definitely destroy all reactionary forces in the countryside. The countryside has sharp class struggles, which are both our good classrooms and our battlefields. We are prepared to continuously and systematically send revolutionary students to the countryside to combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from them, and together with them study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and together repel the new counterattacks of the capitalist reactionary line, making the leadership of the countryside firmly in the hands of revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants.

The second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" and the editorials from the "Wenhui Daily" and the "Liberation Daily" have greatly inspired the revolutionary rebels on various fronts in Xi'an. They enthusiastically hail the rise of the Shanghai peasant revolutionary movement. Revolutionary comrades from the Xi'an Region Industrial and Mining Cultural Revolution United Front said, we Xi'an region industrial and mining revolutionary rebels warmly welcome and strongly support the peasant revolutionary movement. We revolutionary rebel workers must, together with the revolutionary rebel poor and lower-middle peasants, vigorously promote the rebel spirit of revolutionary peasants, jointly launch a fierce struggle against a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party, against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line, and crush the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind. Revolutionary rebel peasants in the suburbs of Xi'an were very happy upon hearing the news and enthusiastically hailed: It's very good! It's very good! They expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary rebel peasants in Shanghai, rapidly develop the peasant revolutionary movement, sweep away the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind blowing into the countryside, launch a fierce struggle against a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party and against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, smash the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line, and seize the victory of the countryside cultural revolution. They expressed their determination to unite with revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and intellectuals, making the revolutionary worker movement, peasant movement, and student movement advance victoriously along the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao, and in the struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, cultivating ourselves into a new generation with high socialist and communist consciousness.

Revolutionary rebels and broad revolutionary masses in Chengdu enthusiastically hailed the second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai," expressing their resolute support for the peasant revolutionary movement. Revolutionary rebel workers from the Chengdu Measuring and Cutting Tool Factory said, poor and lower-middle peasants are the reliable allies of the working class. Workers and peasants are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen the great alliance of various revolutionary rebels, support each other, and fight shoulder to shoulder to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Revolutionary rebel commune members in the suburbs of Chengdu enthusiastically hailed that the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary rebels and dealt a heavy blow to the capitalist reactionary line. Revolutionary rebel commune members from the Suopo Commune said: Recently, a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party, seeing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside developing vigorously, tried to use "raising the grain ration standard" as bait to distribute collective reserve grain to commune members, undermine the collective economy, corrupt the fighting spirit of revolutionary masses, split the revolutionary ranks, and shift the direction of the cultural revolution struggle, opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, disrupting the cultural revolution, and disrupting production. However, we revolutionary rebels and broad masses of commune members have seen through the conspiracy of these handful of elements and resisted this evil wind. In the future, we will insist on grasping revolution and promoting production, seriously implement the Party's policies, and correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual in distribution, thoroughly smashing counter-revolutionary revisionist economism. More than a thousand Red Guards and revolutionary students from Sichuan Medical College have conducted investigations and research in the countryside and participated in the countryside cultural revolution with the peasants. Red Guards and revolutionary students from this college expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, go to the countryside, live, work, and fight with the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from them, seriously reform their thoughts, and unite with the broad worker-peasant masses to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 21st—Revolutionary rebels and broad revolutionary masses from various sectors in Shanghai enthusiastically hailed the second "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" issued by the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Peasants' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, and other revolutionary rebel organizations. They believe that this is another very important document following the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" issued on January 5th. The issuance of this document has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary rebels, crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, promoted the vigorous development of the peasant revolutionary movement, and dealt a strong blow to counter-revolutionary economism, marking an important stage in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Shanghai region.

Revolutionary rebel workers, students, and cadres in the city most resolutely support the peasant revolutionary movement in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They believe that the general direction of the revolutionary peasants is correct. Yesterday, after seeing the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai," they enthusiastically hailed the rise of the suburban peasant movement as a great event that will definitely promote the development of the peasant revolutionary movement across the country; revolutionary peasants will sweep away a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, thoroughly smash the capitalist reactionary line, fiercely impact the private ownership concept and habitual forces that have existed for thousands of years, and in the struggle, foster a batch of new-type peasants armed with Mao Zedong Thought and with high socialist consciousness.

Shanghai revolutionary workers said: The peasant revolutionary movement is very good! It is excellent! Just as Chairman Mao pointed out in his brilliant work "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan": "The actions of the peasants are completely correct, and their actions are very good!" We are determined to fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary peasants and seize new victories in the cultural revolution. Revolutionary students, as soon as they got the newspapers and leaflets with the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai," went to various counties in the suburbs to propagate and distribute them; some also held symposiums with peasants, criticizing counter-revolutionary economism together with the peasants. Many revolutionary students said: We resolutely support the peasant revolutionary movement. Only the revolutionary worker movement, revolutionary peasant movement, and revolutionary student movement combined together can form a powerful revolutionary torrent, thoroughly smash the capitalist reactionary line, and firmly grasp the destiny of proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy in our own hands.

The "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" reached the suburban countryside, and broad revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants spread the news. Fields and villages were filled with cheers. Many poor and lower-middle peasants excitedly said: This document is great, and it is very timely! They said, when we resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call of "you must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," breaking through numerous obstacles, and joining the revolutionary torrent one after another, launching a fierce struggle against a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party, against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and against the capitalist reactionary line, a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party blew a counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind in the countryside, trying to incite some commune members who were unaware of the truth to leave their production posts and rush to the cities; and in the year-end distribution, they played tricks, trying to create contradictions, expand differences, disrupt the worker-peasant alliance, and undermine the socialist foundation. They cited a large amount of material to expose the serious consequences caused by the economic wind blown by the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee in the countryside. In one brigade of the Waigang Commune in Jiading County, almost all the production funds that should have been retained were distributed. Due to the evil influence of the economic wind, some commune members were not diligent in production, and some places did not pay attention to winter wheat management. Just at this time, the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" was issued. They excitedly said: This document expresses our revolutionary rebels' boundless love and loyalty to the Party and Chairman Mao. It greatly boosted our morale and courage. We will resolutely repel the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic wind. Warriors from the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Hongqiao Commune in Shanghai County said proudly: We peasants join the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to defend Chairman Mao, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend the iron proletarian mountain, not for a few yuan, nor for a little living welfare! Warriors from the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Jiading County said angrily: A handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party try to use money to undermine our revolutionary fighting spirit and implement the reactionary "three lights" policy of "distribute all, eat all, use all" in distribution. This is a pipe dream! We warn these people: You want to corrupt us with economism, not a thousand times, not ten thousand times! They also resolutely expressed that in the current distribution, they will definitely implement the Party's policies and correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, making the year-end distribution even better.

Revolutionary peasants also expressed their determination to fully and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," being both the vanguard of the cultural revolution and the pioneers of agricultural production, daring to shoulder the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. Recently, a handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party and stubborn elements adhering to the capitalist reactionary line in the Chenxi Commune, which was one of the earliest to rise up in the peasant movement in Jiading County, ignored production and closed their eyes to it. The rebel teams and revolutionary peasants took up the heavy burden of production, pooling their wisdom, applying winter fertilizer, leveling the land, and making winter production hot and lively. Various peasant rebel organizations in Jiading County, based on the directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," are preparing to launch a new production high tide across the county.

The "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" reached the suburban countryside of Shanghai, and broad revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants were greatly inspired. They are determined to thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line!

    全市革命造反派的工人、学生、干部，在当前的无产阶级文化大革命中最坚决地支持农民的革命运动。他们认为，革命农民的大方向是正确的。昨天他们看到《告上海全市人民书》后，热烈欢呼郊区农民运动的兴起是一件了不起的大事，它必将推动全国革命农民运动的发展；革命农民必将横扫一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子，彻底砸烂资产阶级反动路线，猛烈冲击几千年来的私有观念和习惯势力，在斗争中造就一批用毛泽东思想武装起来的具有高度社会主义觉悟的新型农民。
    上海革命工人说：革命农民运动好得很！好极了！它正如毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》这篇光辉著作中所指出的：“农民的举动，完全是对的，他们的举动好得很！”我们决心同革命农民并肩战斗，夺取文化大革命的新胜利。广大革命学生一拿到刊有《告上海全市人民书》的报纸和传单，就到郊区各县去宣传和散发；有的还和农民开座谈会，同农民一起批判反革命经济主义。许多革命学生说：我们坚决支持革命农民运动，只有革命的工人运动、革命的农民运动和革命的学生运动相结合，才能汇成一股强大的革命洪流，彻底摧毁资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己手里。
    《告上海全市人民书》传到郊区农村，广大革命的贫下中农奔走相告，田间、村落，一片欢呼声。许多贫下中农激动地说：这个文件太好了，太及时了！他们说，当我们坚决响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，冲破重重阻力，纷纷起来投入革命洪流，大造一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派的反，大造地、富、反、坏、右的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反的时候，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，在农村刮起了反革命经济主义的阴风，妄图唆使一些不明真相的社员离开生产岗位，涌向城市；并在年终分配问题上大搞阴谋，企图制造矛盾，扩大差别，破坏工农联盟，挖社会主义墙脚。他们举出大量材料，揭露了上海市委在农村中刮经济主义黑风所造成的严重恶果。嘉定县外冈公社有一个大队在分配时，几乎把应该提留的生产资金都分掉了。由于经济主义黑风的恶劣影响，使一些社员不安心生产，有些地方冬季麦田管理没有抓紧。正在这时候，《告上海全市人民书》发表了。他们激动地说：这个文件表达了我们革命造反派对党对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的心情，它大大撑了我们的腰，壮了我们的胆，我们要坚决击退反革命经济主义黑风。上海县虹桥公社农民革命造反司令部的战士豪迈地说：我们农民投入无产阶级文化大革命，就是为了保卫毛主席，保卫党中央，保卫无产阶级铁打江山，而绝不是为了几块钱，为了一点生活福利！嘉定县农民革命造反总司令部战士气愤地说：一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图用金钱来瓦解我们的革命斗志，在分配中推行反动的“分光、吃光、用光”的“三光”政策，这是痴心梦想！我们要正告这些人：你们要用经济主义来腐蚀我们，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！他们还坚决表示，在当前分配中，一定按照党的政策，正确处理国家、集体和个人三者的关系，把年终分配搞得更好。
    革命农民们还表示一定要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，既当文化大革命的尖兵，又做农业生产的闯将，勇于挑起革命和生产的两副担子。嘉定县农民运动兴起最早的城西公社城北大队，最近一个时期，一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，对生产闭眼不管，造反队员和革命农民就奋勇挑起生产重担，群策群力，他们追施腊肥，平整土地，把冬季生产搞得热火朝天。嘉定县各农民造反派组织，根据“抓革命，促生产”的方针，准备在全县掀起一个新的生产高潮。（附图片）
