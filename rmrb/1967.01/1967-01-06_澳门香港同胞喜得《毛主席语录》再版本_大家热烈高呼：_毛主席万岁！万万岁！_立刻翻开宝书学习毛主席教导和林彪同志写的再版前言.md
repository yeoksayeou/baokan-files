The revolutionary treasure, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which includes a preface by Comrade Lin Biao, as well as Chairman Mao badges, were issued in Macao and Hong Kong on the 3rd and 4th of this month. They were met with unprecedented enthusiasm by the compatriots in both places.

Upon receiving "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao badges, the compatriots in Macao and Hong Kong congratulated each other and enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" The compatriots in Macao said that this is the greatest concern and strongest support from the great socialist motherland for the compatriots in Macao who are steadfastly fighting against oppression.

On the morning of the 3rd, two hours before the Xingguang Bookstore in Macao opened for business, more than a hundred people braved the cold to queue up outside. The bookstore opened early to serve the crowd. Workers, peasants, fishermen, students, and housewives continuously flocked to the bookstore. In less than six hours, the bookstore's supply of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which includes the preface by Comrade Lin Biao, as well as the Chairman Mao badges, were all sold out.

Many readers, upon receiving the revolutionary treasure from the staff, jumped for joy. Some immediately opened the book to study Chairman Mao's teachings and the preface written by Comrade Lin Biao. They said, "In our struggle against the fascist atrocities of the Portuguese authorities, we rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We cannot do without Chairman Mao's teachings for a moment. We fight, study, and apply what we learn. Every victory we achieve is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought."

While obtaining the revolutionary treasure, the compatriots in Macao also received the Chairman Mao badges they had longed for. A housewife and her six children entered the bookstore in line and loudly sang "The Ship Sails on Because It Has a Helmsman." A kindergarten teacher, seeing that the children she brought with her were all wearing the red, shining Chairman Mao badges, happily told others, "Their parents want their children to love Chairman Mao from a young age." Many old workers in the bookstore, while helping their children wear the Chairman Mao badges, taught them to read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

Many compatriots in Macao, after obtaining the long-awaited "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Chairman Mao badges, expressed that in the new year, they would study Chairman Mao's works even more diligently, learn and apply them in the struggle, and march forward more vigorously under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

In Hong Kong, as the news of the reprint of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" spread, people immediately called bookstores from all directions to place orders. On the morning of the 3rd, bookstores in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the suburbs were bustling with people from morning to evening. After receiving the revolutionary treasure from the staff, everyone was overjoyed and extremely excited. A woman in her fifties exclaimed, "Remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, we fear nothing!"

Many bookstore employees in Hong Kong and Macao regarded the issuance of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as a top priority. Some bookstore employees gave up their New Year's holiday, turning the bookstore into a classroom for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. Wholesale bookstore employees, after work, braved the cold to distribute the treasure to various bookstores at night. Many employees also seriously studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Serve the People" before selling the treasure.

    澳门香港同胞喜得《毛主席语录》再版本
    大家热烈高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”立刻翻开宝书学习毛主席教导和林彪同志写的再版前言
    新华社香港五日电　印有林彪同志写的“再版前言”的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，以及毛主席像章，三、四两日在澳门、香港发行，受到两地同胞空前热烈的欢迎。
    澳门、香港同胞喜得《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章后，大家互相祝贺，热烈高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”澳门同胞说，这是伟大的社会主义祖国对正在坚持反迫害斗争的澳门同胞的最大关怀，也是一个最有力的支持。
    三日清晨，早在澳门星光书店开始营业前两个小时，就有一百多人冒着寒风在门前排队等候。书店提早开门接待群众。工人、农民、渔民、师生和家庭主妇不断地拥向书店。不到六个小时，星光书店供应的有林彪同志写的“再版前言”的《毛主席语录》以及同时供应的毛主席像章，就全部被群众购买一空。
    许多读者从营业员的手里接过革命宝书后，高兴得跳起来，有的立刻翻开宝书，认真地学习毛主席的教导和林彪同志写的“再版前言”。他们说，我们在反对澳葡当局的法西斯暴行的斗争中，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们一刻也离不开毛主席他老人家的教导。我们一面斗，一面学，一面用，我们的每一个胜利都是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    澳门同胞在喜得革命宝书的同时，还得到了他们日夜盼望的毛主席像章。一位家庭主妇同她的六个小孩排队进入书店后，高声齐唱《大海航行靠舵手》。一位托儿所的保育员看着由她带来的十几个小孩都戴上了红光闪闪的毛主席像章后，高兴地对人说，他们的家长要自己的儿女从小就敬爱毛主席。不少的老工人在书店里，一边为儿女佩戴毛主席像章，一边教导他们要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    许多澳门同胞得到了盼望已久的《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章后纷纷表示，在新的一年里，要更加努力学习毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进。
    在香港，当《毛主席语录》再版本即将发行的喜讯传开后，人们立刻从各处纷纷打电话到书店要求预订。三日清晨，香港、九龙和市郊的书店里，从早到晚人们川流不息。人们从营业员的手里接过革命宝书后，都兴高采烈，激动万分，一个五十多岁的妇女激动地说，“记住毛主席的教导，我们什么也不怕！”
    香港和澳门许多书店的职工把发行《毛主席语录》当成头等重要的大事。一些书店的职工放弃元旦假期，把书店布置成了宣传毛泽东思想的大课堂。批发书店的职工在下班后，顶着寒风连夜把宝书分发给各个书店。许多职工在发售宝书前，还认真地学习了《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》两篇文章。
