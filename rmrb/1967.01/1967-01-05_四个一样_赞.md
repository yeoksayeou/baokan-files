There is a combat hero who, though advanced in years, is at the forefront of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. His insights are rich. One of them is to frequently use the "Three Articles" as a weapon to charge towards the "bitter" character, achieving the "four equals." What are the "four equals"? They are: "In peacetime, one should endure hardship as in wartime; when serving as a cadre, one should endure hardship as a soldier; when old, one should endure hardship as in youth; in peaceful times, one should endure hardship as in difficult times."

These "four equals" are indeed precious, embodying the strong self-awareness and thorough revolutionary spirit of the older generation of revolutionaries, carrying forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle in our army.

In essence, the "four equals" boil down to one "equal," that is, a red heart that never changes, always moving forward without turning back. This combat hero, in his ideological transformation, adheres to the "four firsts," finding joy in hardship, with boundless joy. When going to the grassroots, he does not seek special treatment; whatever the soldiers do, he does too. During marches, he does not ride in vehicles or on horses, always choosing to walk, voluntarily enduring hardship to make revolution.

Revolutionaries must dare to endure hardship. Fear of hardship will cause the red color to fade. Only by not fearing hardship and not fearing death can one ensure continuous brave advancement. Decide to train here, it's great! The "four equals" are the virtues of revolutionaries, a high standard of ideological revolutionization.

Change and No Change

People's age will inevitably increase. But thoughts should not age. The preciousness of the "four equals" lies in the fact that, despite changes in environment, position, and age, and despite the changing situation of class struggle, one's red heart, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, remains unshakable.

In times of changing environment, position, and age, whether one remains the "same" or "different" in these four aspects reflects two different worldviews. Those with a bourgeois worldview believe: the higher the rank, the more one should enjoy; the better the living conditions, the more one should seek comfort; the older the age, the more one should have a comfortable old age. Proletarian revolutionaries, however, are the opposite. We believe that even if positions, environments, and ages change, the spirit of hard struggle cannot change, the ordinary soldier's spirit cannot change, the thoughts and feelings of the working people cannot change, and loyalty to the Party, to the people, and to the proletarian revolutionary essence cannot change.

Conditions and situations are constantly changing, and everyone will encounter this. How can one ensure that the situation changes but the red heart does not? In one sentence, it is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to work hard on the "use" aspect, to thoroughly transform one's thoughts, and to thoroughly transform one's worldview.

Decide to achieve the "four equals," this is a good experience for a lifetime of revolution, a lifetime of tempering revolutionary will.

    “四个一样”和一个一样
    有个战斗英雄年纪大了，但他活学活用毛主席著作却走在前边，学习的体会很丰富。其中有一点就是要常常以“老三篇”为武器，向“苦”字冲锋，做到“四个一样”。什么“四个一样”呢？那就是：“平时要像战时一样吃苦；当干部要像当战士一样吃苦；年老了要像年轻时一样吃苦；和平时期要像艰苦时期一样吃苦。”
    这“四个一样”实在可贵，表现了老一辈革命者强烈的自觉革命、彻底革命精神，发扬了我军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。
    这“四个一样”，说到底，实在是一个一样，那就是一颗红心永不变，一直前进不回头。这位战斗英雄，他在思想改造上坚持“四个第一”，以苦为乐、其乐无穷，下连不特殊，战士干啥他干啥。行军时，有车不坐，有马不骑，找机会就走路，自觉吃苦闹革命。
    革命者，就要敢于吃苦。害怕吃苦，红色就会褪掉。只有不怕苦、不怕死，才能保证永远奋勇前进。下决心从这里锻炼，好得很！“四个一样”是革命者的美德，是思想革命化的一个高标准。
    变和不变
    人的年龄总是要老的。但思想不能老。“四个一样”的可贵，就是在环境变了，职务变了，年岁变了，阶级斗争的形势变化的情况下，做到千变万变而一颗忠于毛泽东思想的红心却坚决不变。
    在环境变化，职务变化，年岁变化的时候，在这四项上是“一样”还是“不一样”，是两种世界观的反映。抱有资产阶级世界观的人认为：“官”越大，越应该享受，生活越好，越应该贪图安逸，年龄越老，越应该有一个舒适的晚年。无产阶级革命者却相反，我们认为，职务变了、环境变了、年岁变了，艰苦奋斗的作风不能变，普通一兵本色不能变，劳动人民思想感情不能变，忠于党，忠于人民，忠于无产阶级的革命本质不能变。
    条件、情况总是不断在变的，每一个人都会遇到。怎么能做到情况变，但红心不变呢？一句话，就是要活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，彻底地改造思想，彻底地改造世界观。
    下决心做到“四个一样”，这是我们一辈子干革命，一辈子锻炼革命意志的一条好经验。
