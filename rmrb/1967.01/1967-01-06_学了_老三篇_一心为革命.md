After Comrade Lin Biao called for a new stage in the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works quickly swept across the nation. People everywhere are deeply studying Chairman Mao's works and enthusiastically discussing and applying the "Three Articles." The brilliant ideas in the "Three Articles" have deeply penetrated people's hearts and are increasingly transforming their spiritual outlook.

Below is the speech given by Song Dengke, a poor and lower-middle peasant from the Daping Production Brigade in Xiji County, Ningxia, and his family, at a meeting to discuss the "Three Articles."

Shepherd Song Dengke said:

After studying Chairman Mao's books, my heart is filled with revolutionary spirit. As long as it benefits the collective and the revolution, I am willing to do anything.

I often tell my children: Chairman Mao's works are the family treasures of the working people, passed down from generation to generation. In the old society, we poor people were "with sky but no sun, with words but no tongue, often behind the cows, rarely in front of people." Now, we have become masters of the state and have read Chairman Mao's books. Our voices are loud, and our steps are firm. Chairman Mao's books, the more I study, the more I love them. The more I study, the clearer my mind becomes, the more energetic I feel, and the brighter my eyes become!

In the past, I was selfish and short-sighted, only caring about the two cents of work in front of me and neglecting collective matters. I was responsible for herding over fifty sheep for the brigade, but I did it poorly. I didn't want to clean the sheep pen because the work points were few, so I pretended to have leg pain and asked the brigade leader to send someone else to do it. However, when it came to distributing firewood, vegetables, and other items, I was always at the front, always wanting to get more and better shares. Fellow villagers said I was selfish, and I was criticized many times, but I didn't change.

After studying the "Three Articles," I understood many principles of being a revolutionary. Chairman Mao said: "Many people are irresponsible in their work, picking the easy tasks and pushing the heavy ones onto others. When faced with a task, they first think of themselves and then of others." I thought: Isn't Chairman Mao criticizing me with these words? Why am I like this? It's because I have a "selfish" mindset. A person with selfishness will harm the public interest, damage socialism, and harm society. From that moment on, I made up my mind to break away from selfishness and establish public-mindedness. I will learn from Comrade White and be selfless, dedicated to serving the people; like Comrade Zhang, I will serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly."

Now, I still herd sheep for the brigade, and the flock has increased to over eighty. I start early and do a good job. If the sheep give birth in the mountains, I fear they might freeze, so I wrap them in my own coat and carry them back. If the lambs don't have enough milk, I feed them with porridge. I would never do this before! At that time, even if my dog followed and watched the sheep all day, I would still ask the brigade for feed. Now, after studying Chairman Mao's books, my heart is filled with revolutionary spirit. As long as it benefits the collective and the revolution, I am willing to do anything. Because I herd them with care, this year over eighty sheep are all fat and healthy, and everyone who sees them loves them. Someone said, "Song Dengke has changed." I said, "After studying Chairman Mao's books, my mind is clear, my eyes are bright, and my spirit is high. I will herd sheep for the revolution for the rest of my life."

Song Dengke's wife, Gao Lan Ying, said:

In the past, my heart was only filled with my small family. After studying the "Three Articles," my heart is filled with the socialist collective, and I take the lead in everything.

In the past, I didn't know how to study. I thought, with so many children, I have to take care of their eating and wearing, and I didn't have the heart to study. But comrades were very enthusiastic and explained to me many times the significance of studying Chairman Mao's works and the meaning of "In Memory of Norman Bethune." They spoke so passionately that my heart was also enlightened. I was illiterate and had great difficulty studying, but comrades taught me. I studied before meals, after meals, and all day long. My mind was empty, filled only with Chairman Mao's words.

In the past, I turned a blind eye to collective matters, always thinking about my children's eating and wearing, and how to cultivate my private plot well. I was always at the back when going to work and at the front when finishing work. My heart was only filled with my small family. After studying the "Three Articles," I understood the principles of farming for the revolution, and my heart was filled with the socialist collective. I took the lead and ran to the front. I was at the front when going to work and at the back when finishing work, striving to do as much work as possible. When encountering difficulties, I would think of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely, fearlessly, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." This year, when pulling wheat, it rained heavily, and some people wanted to go home. I recited this passage to everyone. Chairman Mao's words are powerful. Everyone said, "Let's do it," and we pulled the wheat in the rain.

To "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, one must remove the "selfish" mindset and fill it with public-mindedness. My family has many people, and we eat a lot, often needing to grind flour. In the past, I always ground it during the day, and once I ground flour, I couldn't participate in the brigade's activities. I thought grinding flour was a private matter, and the brigade's work was a public matter. Poor and lower-middle peasants should prioritize the public over the private. So, I used the night to grind flour and went to work during the day as usual. In the past, if I saw someone's pig eating the brigade's grain, I wouldn't care. I thought the collective was so big, and even if the pig ate a little, it wouldn't amount to much when it reached me, so why offend people. Now, if I see someone's pig eating the brigade's grain, my heart aches, and I immediately drive it away. I think, to be revolutionary, one must be genuinely revolutionary, not just revolutionary in words. One must follow the example of Zhang and White, cast away the "selfish" mindset, and become a selfless person dedicated to serving the people.

Song Dengke's eldest son, Song Tinghai, said:

After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I understood that to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, one must learn from Comrade Zhang, be dedicated to the public, and dedicated to the collective. I will herd sheep for the revolution and take over the revolutionary cause.

I started studying Chairman Mao's books later than my father, mother, and younger brother. Later, I saw that everyone in the brigade was studying, and I also started. I thought: Chairman Mao wants us young people to be successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. To be a successor, one must read Chairman Mao's books.

Before studying the "Three Articles," I only liked to play. When the brigade asked me to herd donkeys, I didn't want to, and I would drive the donkeys up the mountain without caring if they were full or not, and just drive them back at the right time. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I understood that to "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, one must learn from Comrade Zhang, be dedicated to the public, and dedicated to the collective. After that, I would drive the donkeys out early every day, looking for places with plenty of grass, and making sure they drank water. Fellow villagers said that the few donkeys I herd are much fatter than before.

Now, my father plows for the brigade, and I herd sheep. I think, to herd sheep for the revolution, to take over the revolutionary cause. I will forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions; I will dedicate my life to the revolution and read Chairman Mao's books for life.

Song Dengke's youngest son, Song Tingjiang, said:

The purpose of my studying is to serve the people and be a servant of the people. Now, the brigade wants me to be a small teacher, guiding the whole family to study Chairman Mao's works, and I will definitely do this job well.

I heard my father say that our family has never had anyone study before, and I am the first student. However, in the past, I was not clear about the purpose of my studies. Before going to school, I still helped my mother with some chores, but after going to school, I became a bit lazy. After studying the "Three Articles," I finally understood that the purpose of my studies is to serve the people and be a servant of the people. From then on, after school, if I saw that the brigade's livestock were not herded properly, I would voluntarily ask to herd them. When herding, I was also very careful, and after herding well, I would also take the time to pick up manure for the brigade.

After the brigade launched the activity to study Chairman Mao's works, they asked me to be a family small teacher, guiding the whole family to study. I thought: propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the glorious task of young people in the Mao Zedong era, and I must do this job well. My father, mother, and older brother do not know how to read, so I taught them letter by letter. If I didn't understand something, I would ask the teacher and then tell them. I will read Chairman Mao's books for life and propagate Mao Zedong Thought for life. Our country is a great proletarian dictatorship socialist country with seven hundred million people, needing a unified, revolutionary, and correct thought, which is Mao Zedong Thought.

### 学了“老三篇”一心为革命

    学了“老三篇”一心为革命
    在林彪同志发出把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段的号召以后，全国很快出现了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。人们到处在大学毛主席著作，大讲大用“老三篇”。“老三篇”的光辉思想，已经深入人心，正在日益改变着人们的精神面貌。
    下面是宁夏西吉县大坪公社下中农社员宋登科一家人，在一次生产队学习“老三篇”讲用会上的发言。　——编者
    放牧员宋登科说：
    学了毛主席的书，心里想的是革命。只要对集体有利，对革命有利，我什么都豁得出来。
    我经常给娃娃讲：毛主席著作是我们劳动人民的传家宝，子子孙孙离不了。在旧社会，我们穷汉是“有天无日头，有话无舌头，多在牛后头，少在人前头。”现在，我们当了国家的主人，又读了毛主席的书，说话声大，走路步大。毛主席的书，我越学越爱学，越学头脑越清，劲头越足，眼睛越亮！
    过去，我私心重，眼睛看不远，光看到脚面梁梁上二分工，把集体的事情抛一边。我给队里放着五十几只羊，还放不好。羊圈不愿垫，嫌工分少，装腿疼，叫队长派人垫。可是，队里分个柴草、蔬菜什么的，我却跑在前面，总想多分点、分好点。社员都说我私心重，批评过多少回，我都没有转变。
    学习了“老三篇”，我懂得了许多做革命人的道理。毛主席说过：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”我就想：毛主席讲的这一段话，不是在批评我吗？为什么我会这样呢？就因为我头脑里有个“私”字。一个人有了私心，就会损公肥己，坑害社会主义。从这时起，我下了决心，要狠破“私”字，大立“公”字。向白求恩学习，毫不利己，专门利人；像张思德一样，“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务。
    现在，我还给队里放羊，羊群增加到八十几只，我赶的早，还要赶的好。羊在山上下了羔，我怕冻着，就用自己的皮袄包住抱回来；羊羔奶不够吃，我就用面汤喂，把洋芋煮烂给羊羔吃。这在以前我才不干哩！那时，自家的狗跟着看一天羊，我还向队里要料哩。如今，学了毛主席的书，心里想的是革命。只要对集体有利，对革命有利，我什么都豁得出来。因为放得经心，今年八十多只羊只只长得膘肥体壮，谁见了谁爱。有人说：“宋登科变了。”我说：“学了毛主席的书，我心明了，眼亮了，劲头大了。我要为革命放一辈子羊。”
    宋登科的老伴高兰英说：
    过去，我心窝里只有一个小家庭。学了“老三篇”，心窝里装进了社会主义大集体，干什么都带头往前跑。
    我过去不知道学习，心想咱这么多娃娃，要顾吃，要顾穿，心还操不到学习上。可是，同志们热情得很，几次给我讲学习毛主席著作的意义，讲《为人民服务》，把我的心也给讲得亮起来了。我原来一个字不识，学习困难很大，同志们就教我。我饭前学，饭后学，一天学到黑，脑子里啥都不装，光装毛主席的话。
    过去，集体的事我看见也当没看见，心里想的是娃娃们吃穿的事，自留地咋能种好等等。上工时走在后边，收工抢在前边。心窝里只有一个小家庭。学了“老三篇”，知道了为革命种庄稼的道理，心窝里装进了社会主义的大集体，我便带头往前边跑。上工走在人前头，收工留在人后头，争取尽量多干点活。一遇上困难，我就想起了毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”今年拔麦时，一天下了大雨，有些人想回家，我就给大家背这段话。毛主席的话真灵，大家说声“干”，就冒着雨拔开了。
    要“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就得去掉头脑里的“私”字，装上“公”字。我家人口多，吃饭多，经常要磨面。过去我都是白天磨，一磨面就不能参加队里活。我想磨面是私事，生产队里的活才是公事，贫下中农应该先公后私。于是，我就利用晚上磨面，白天照常出工。以前，谁家的猪吃队里粮食，我看见也不当回事。心想：集体这么大个家业，猪吃一点，分到我跟前能有多少，何必得罪人。现在，若是看到谁家的猪吃队上的粮食，我心里就痛得不行，马上把它赶开。我想，要革命，就真心革命，不能口头革命。要学习张思德、白求恩的样子，把“私”字抛得远远的，做个毫不利己专门利人的人。
    宋登科的大儿子宋廷海说：
    学习了《为人民服务》，知道了要“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就应该向张思德同志学习，一心为公，一心为集体。我要为革命放羊，接好革命的班。
    我学习毛主席的书，比爸爸、妈妈和弟弟都晚。后来，我看见队里大家都在学，我也动起来了。心想：毛主席要我们青年人做无产阶级革命事业接班人，做接班人就得读毛主席的书。
    没学“老三篇”以前，我光爱玩。队里叫我放驴，我不愿放，把驴赶上山，也不管它吃饱没吃饱，到时候就赶回来。学习了《为人民服务》，知道了要“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，就应该向张思德同志学习，一心为公，一心为集体。以后，我每天一早就把驴赶出去，专找草多的地方放，驴吃饱了还想法叫它喝些水。社员都说我放的几头驴，比过去肥多了。
    现在，我爹给队上犁地，叫我放羊。我想，要为革命放羊，要接好革命的班。我要永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事；干一辈子革命，读一辈子毛主席的书。
    宋登科的小儿子宋廷江说：
    我念书的目的，是为人民服务，给人民当勤务员。现在，队里要我当小教员，辅导全家学习毛主席著作，我一定把这工作做好。
    听我爹讲，我家里几辈子人都没念过书，我是家里第一个学生。可是，过去我对学习目的并不明确。没上学前，还帮妈妈做点事，上了学，就变得有点懒了。学了“老三篇”，才知道我念书的目的，是为人民服务，给人民当勤务员。从此以后，我放学回来，看见队里牲口放不过来，就主动要求去放牲口。放牲口时，也很经心，放好了，我还抽空给队里拾粪。
    队里开展学习毛主席著作活动后，要我当家庭小教员，辅导全家学习。我想：宣传毛泽东思想，是毛泽东时代青少年的光荣任务，我一定要把这工作做好。爸爸、妈妈和哥哥都不识字，我就手把着手教他们。自己不懂得的地方，问了老师再告诉他们。我要读一辈子毛主席的书，宣传一辈子毛泽东思想。我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。（附图片）
