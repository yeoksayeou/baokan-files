Indian progressive publications have recently published articles praising the Chinese Cultural Revolution and severely criticizing the slanderous propaganda of Indian reactionaries and bourgeois newspapers against the Chinese Cultural Revolution.

An article in the monthly publication *The People's Path* published in Punjab praises the Chinese Cultural Revolution, stating: "Unlike the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (who have now completely abandoned the revolutionary path of Marxism-Leninism), the Chinese leadership firmly believes that the revolution must be advanced step by step until communism is ultimately victorious." The article states that the experience of the Soviet Union teaches us that the Communist Party and the masses must break with the culture and ideology of the exploiting classes.

The article refutes the distortions of the Chinese Cultural Revolution by reactionaries around the world, saying: "No matter how many horror stories are fabricated, no matter how much slander is spread, it cannot diminish the overwhelming momentum of this movement."

The article points out that the Indian reactionaries attack the Chinese Cultural Revolution to prevent the Indian masses from understanding the truth about China's cultural upsurge. The ruling class in India fears that once the people understand their own strength and potential, they will take measures to end the rule of these classes. The ruling class in India "cannot have a peaceful day. The tide of history cannot be reversed. If the ruling class or their lackeys do not understand that the end is near, there is no help for it."

An article in the weekly publication *Patriots' Remembrance* in Punjab also refutes the slanderous remarks of Indian bourgeois newspapers about the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The article states: "The bourgeois intellectuals in India attack the policies of the Chinese Communist Party. This is nothing new.... When the October Revolution occurred in Russia, they also shouted loudly and slandered the October Revolution in the name of religion and humanity, in order to please their bourgeois masters." The article points out that today, those who fawn over the Soviet leaders and feast at the banquets set by the Soviet leaders are precisely these people. They know that the Soviet leaders will not pose a threat to capitalism and imperialism. The path China is taking is correct. Therefore, they raise a chorus of opposition to China.

The article condemns the bourgeois intellectuals in India for advocating for Nehru and his brand of "socialism," misleading the workers and peasants of India. However, the facts are clear: "India has already fallen to the status of a beggar, Gandhi's followers have mortgaged India to imperialism, and under the deceptive slogans of 'freedom' and 'socialism,' they have ruthlessly and mercilessly made our compatriots shed blood and sacrifice."

    印度进步报刊驳斥印度反动派的卑鄙宣传
    任何诽谤无损中国文化大革命的光辉
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：印度的一些进步报刊不久前发表文章，热情地赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命，并且严厉地斥责印度反动派和资产阶级报刊诬蔑中国文化大革命的卑鄙宣传。
    在旁遮普出版的《人民之路》月刊的一篇赞扬中国文化大革命的文章说：“和苏联共产党的领导（他们现在已经完全背弃了马克思列宁主义的革命道路）不同，中国的领导坚信，要把革命一步一步推向前进，直到共产主义最后取得胜利”。文章说，苏联的经历提供的教训是：共产党和群众必须同剥削阶级的文化和意识形态决裂。
    文章驳斥各国反动派歪曲中国文化大革命的宣传说：“不管捏造多少恐怖故事，不管怎样大肆诬蔑，都无损于这个运动的排山倒海的声势。”
    文章指出，印度反动派攻击中国文化大革命的目的是要使印度群众不了解中国文化高涨的真相。印度统治阶级害怕，人民一旦懂得自己的力量和潜力，他们就会采取措施来结束这些阶级的统治。印度的统治阶级“是过不了太平日子的。历史的潮流是不能倒转的。统治阶级或他们的奴才，如果不理解末日就要到来的预兆，那是没有办法的事。”
    旁遮普《回忆爱国者报》周刊发表的一篇文章也驳斥印度资产阶级报刊诬蔑中国文化大革命的言论。文章说：印度“资产阶级文人攻击中国党的政策。这一点也不新鲜，……俄国发生十月革命的时候，他们也这样大叫大嚷，并以宗教和人道为名，对十月革命极尽诬蔑诽谤之能事，以便讨他们资产阶级主子的欢心。”文章指出，今天，逢迎苏联领导人、在苏联领导人摆的盛筵上大吃大喝的正是他们这些人。他们今天知道，苏联领导人不会产生对资本主义和帝国主义的威胁。中国走的道路是正确的。因此，他们发出一片反对中国的吵嚷声。
    文章谴责印度的资产阶级文人替尼赫鲁和他的牌号的“社会主义”说教，他们迷惑印度的工农。但是，明摆着的事实是：印度“已经沦落到乞丐的地位，甘地的信徒把印度押给帝国主义了，他们在‘自由’和‘社会主义’的骗人口号下，十分残酷无情地使我们的同胞流血牺牲。”
