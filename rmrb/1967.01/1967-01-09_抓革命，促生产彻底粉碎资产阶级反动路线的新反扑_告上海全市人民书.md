	Grasp the Revolution and Promote Production to Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line
	– A Letter to the People of Shanghai

	Editor's Note: The "Letter to the People of Shanghai" published in the January 5 issue of Shanghai's Wenhui Daily is a document of great importance. This document holds high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, sounding the clarion call for a fierce counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line. This document resolutely responds to Chairman Mao's call to grasp the revolution and promote production, raising key issues in the current proletarian cultural revolution. This is not just a problem for Shanghai, but a national problem. With the development of revolutionary forces in Shanghai, the new faces of the revolutionary Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily have emerged. This is a victory of the proletarian revolutionary line over the bourgeois reactionary line. This is a major event in the history of the development of China's proletarian cultural revolution. This is a great revolution. This major event will undoubtedly play a huge role in promoting the development of the proletarian cultural revolution in the entire East China region and in all provinces and cities across the country.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 8 – On January 5, Shanghai's Wenhui Daily published a letter to the people of Shanghai from the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Command and ten other revolutionary mass organizations. The title is: "Grasp the Revolution and Promote Production to Thoroughly Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line – A Letter to the People of Shanghai." Before the letter, a quote from Chairman Mao was published: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'We must advocate considering the overall situation. Every Party member, every piece of local work, every statement or action must start from the interests of the whole Party and must not violate this principle.'"

	The text of the letter to the people of Shanghai is as follows:

	Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the great proletarian cultural revolution has, over the past few months, achieved great victories in the mass movement to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. We have entered 1967 with the sound of victory. The New Year's editorial in People's Daily and Red Flag Magazine points out: "1967 will be a year of nationwide class struggle. 1967 will be a year when the proletariat, together with other revolutionary masses, launches a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the ghosts and monsters in society. 1967 will be a year of deeper criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line and the elimination of its influence. 1967 will be a year of decisive victory for the struggle, criticism, and reform." In other words, 1967 will be the year when the bourgeois reactionary line collapses and disintegrates completely, and the year when the proletarian cultural revolution achieves decisive great victories.

	The broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai have also achieved initial victories in their struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line implemented by a handful of people within the Party in the Shanghai region, and have entered a new stage of deeper and broader development.

	The proletarian cultural revolution mass movement in Shanghai's factories is surging forward with irresistible momentum and overwhelming force, breaking through all obstacles. We revolutionary rebels, the workers, listen most to Chairman Mao's words and resolutely carry out the policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" personally proposed by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." We revolutionary rebels deeply understand: if we do not do a good job in the proletarian cultural revolution, our production will lose direction and slide towards the capitalist road. The facts we have experienced in the proletarian cultural revolution prove more and more: only by doing a good job in the proletarian cultural revolution can production develop further. The view that opposes the cultural revolution with production development is wrong.

	However, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line are extremely hostile to the proletarian cultural revolution. They use every means to resist Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production." Their tricks are roughly as follows:

	In the early stages of the movement, they used "promoting production" as an excuse to suppress the revolution and oppose the revolution. When we revolutionary rebel workers stood up to revolt and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, they pressed us with production tasks and labeled us with the big hat of "disrupting production." Did they really want to "promote production"? No, they wanted to protect their own positions and obstruct our revolution. We exposed their tricks and bravely rebelled.

	Then, they came up with another trick, appearing in an ultra-leftist guise, using beautiful revolutionary phrases to incite a large number of workers in the Red Guards, who were deceived by them, to use the excuse of going north to "report" and disrupt production and transportation, aiming to disrupt the proletarian cultural revolution and proletarian dictatorship. Recently, a handful of reactionaries have been plotting to stop water, electricity, and transportation. We must expose these reactionaries and implement proletarian dictatorship to severely punish them and ensure that their evil plots do not succeed.

	Revolutionary comrades! Take immediate action! Resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production"! We revolutionary rebel workers must be models of "grasping the revolution and promoting production." We not only want to be the vanguard and backbone of the revolution but also the vanguard and backbone of production promotion. Shanghai is the largest industrial production city in the country, playing an extremely important role in the country's overall economic life. However, recently, in many factories, part or most of the Red Guards have stopped production and left their posts, directly violating the central government's regulations on grasping the revolution and promoting production, and directly affecting people's lives and the development of national economic construction. We revolutionary rebel workers remember Chairman Mao's teachings, resisting this reverse current, displaying a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, and supporting the entire factory's production under extremely difficult conditions. We have strongly struck at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, smashing their grand plot to disrupt the revolution by disrupting production. This is right! This is good! All of us revolutionary rebels must learn from them. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We revolutionary rebel workers have the spirit, determination, and strength to do the revolution and production better, realizing Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp the revolution and promote production."

	Broad revolutionary comrades in the Workers' Red Guards! "Grasping the revolution and promoting production" is the policy proposed by Chairman Mao, repeatedly emphasized by the Party Central Committee, and an important policy to ensure that the proletarian cultural revolution goes to the end. Supporting or not supporting, executing or not executing this policy is a matter of principle and a major issue. You were deceived and left your production posts. Who benefits from this? Who is pleased and who is pained by this? We hope you listen to Chairman Mao's words, see clearly on this major principle issue, distinguish right from wrong, do not be deceived again, wake up quickly, return to your production posts, and return to the proletarian revolutionary line. We revolutionary rebel comrades will warmly welcome you back, revolution together, and do a good job in production. We will not blame you because we are class brothers, because most of you are revolutionary masses poisoned by the bourgeois reactionary line and deceived by the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line.

	All revolutionary students and revolutionary cadres in the city! Let us unite closely with the broad revolutionary workers to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasping the revolution and promoting production," widely carry out propaganda and struggle, and more resolutely launch a fierce attack on the bourgeois reactionary line, smashing all new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, and pushing the proletarian cultural revolution in factories to a new high tide!

	Under the boundless rays of the great thought of Mao Zedong, looking forward to the future, the revolutionary cause is brilliant and splendid. We, the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, all laborers, together with revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres, strive together, fight shoulder to shoulder, advance victoriously, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

	Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!

	Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to our red sun in our hearts, the greatest leader, Chairman Mao!

### 抓革命，促生产彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑——告上海全市人民书

    毛主席教导我们：“要提倡顾全大局。每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”
    抓革命，促生产彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑
    ——告上海全市人民书
    编者按：上海《文汇报》一月五日发表的《告上海全市人民书》，是一个极其重要的文件。这个文件高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，吹响了继续向资产阶级反动路线猛烈反击的号角。这个文件坚决响应毛主席的抓革命，促生产的伟大号召，提出了当前无产阶级文化大革命中的关键问题。这不仅是上海市的问题，而且是全国性的问题。随着上海市革命力量的发展，崭新面貌的、革命的《文汇报》和《解放日报》出现了。这是无产阶级革命路线反对资产阶级反动路线的胜利产物。这是我国无产阶级文化大革命发展史上的一件大事。这是一个大革命。这件大事必将对于整个华东、对于全国各省市的无产阶级文化大革命运动的发展，起着巨大的推动作用。
    新华社上海八日电　上海《文汇报》一月五日发表了上海工人革命造反总司令部等十一个革命群众组织的告上海全市人民书。题目是：“抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑——告上海全市人民书”。文前，刊登了毛主席的一段语录：“毛主席教导我们：‘要提倡顾全大局。每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。’”告上海全市人民书全文如下：
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，几个月来所开展的批判资产阶级反动路线的群众运动，已经取得了极大的胜利。我们在胜利的战歌声中，跨进了一九六七年。《人民日报》《红旗》杂志元旦社论指出：“一九六七年，将是全国全面展开阶级斗争的一年。一九六七年，将是无产阶级联合其他革命群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，展开总攻击的一年。一九六七年，将是更加深入地批判资产阶级反动路线，清除它的影响的一年。一九六七年，将是一斗、二批、三改取得决定性的胜利的一年。”也就是说，一九六七年将是资产阶级反动路线全线崩溃彻底瓦解的一年，将是无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性的伟大胜利的一年。
    上海市广大革命群众，在批判上海地区党内一小撮人所执行的资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，也取得了初步的胜利，并进入了一个更深入、更广阔的新阶段。
    我们上海市工厂的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，冲破一切阻力，汹涌澎湃地向前发展。我们革命造反派的工人，最听毛主席的话，坚决执行毛主席亲自提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”我们革命造反派深深地懂得：不搞好无产阶级文化大革命，我们的生产就会迷失方向，就会滑到资本主义的方向上去。我们在无产阶级文化大革命中所亲身经历的事实越来越多地证明：只有无产阶级文化大革命搞好了，生产才会有更大的发展。把文化大革命同发展生产对立起来的看法，是错误的。
    可是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线的人十分仇视无产阶级文化大革命，他们千方百计地对抗毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。他们的阴谋手段大致表现如下：
    运动初期，他们以“抓生产”为名，来压制革命，反对抓革命。我们革命造反派的工人要起来革命，要批判资产阶级反动路线，他们就以生产任务压工人，给我们扣上“破坏生产”的大帽子。他们是真的要“抓生产”吗？不是的，他们是为了保他们自己的乌纱帽，企图阻挠我们革命。我们戳穿了他们的阴谋诡计，勇敢地起来造反了。
    于是，他们又抛出了另一种花招，以极“左”的面目，以漂亮的革命词句，煽动大批被他们蒙蔽的工人赤卫队队员借口北上“告状”为名，破坏生产，破坏交通运输，以达到他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏无产阶级专政的目的。最近，更有一小撮反动的家伙在阴谋策划停水、停电、停交通。对这样一些反动的家伙，我们一定要把他们揪出来，实行无产阶级专政，严加惩办，决不能让他们的罪恶阴谋得逞。
    革命的工人同志们！紧急行动起来！坚决执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针！我们革命造反派的工人要成为“抓革命，促生产”的模范。我们不但要做抓革命的先锋和骨干，而且也要做促生产的先锋和骨干。我们上海是一个全国最大的工业生产城市，它在国家的整个经济生活中起着极其重大的作用。但是，最近在很多工厂中出现部分或者大部分的赤卫队员停止生产、离开生产岗位的现象，这就直接违反了中央关于抓革命、促生产的规定，直接影响了人民的生活和国民经济建设的发展。我们的革命造反派工人牢记着毛主席的教导，顶着这股逆流，发挥了高度的革命负责精神，在极其困难的条件下，顶起了全厂的生产，有力地打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，粉碎了他们企图用破坏生产来打击革命的大阴谋。这样做得对！做得好！我们全体革命造反派的同志，都要向他们学习。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们革命造反派工人有志气，有决心，有力量，一定能把革命和生产搞得更好，实现毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。
    工人赤卫队的广大的要革命的阶级兄弟们！“抓革命，促生产”是毛主席提出的方针，是党中央一再强调的方针，是保证无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的重要方针。拥护不拥护、执行不执行这个方针是一个原则问题，大是大非问题。你们受他们煽动而离开生产岗位，究竟是对谁有利呢？你们这样做到底是使谁高兴、使谁心痛呢？我们希望你们要听毛主席的话，在这个重大原则问题上，一定要擦亮眼睛，明辨是非，不要再受骗了，赶快觉悟过来，回到生产岗位上来，回到无产阶级革命路线上来。我们革命造反派的同志们一定会热情地欢迎你们回来，和我们共同革命，共同搞好生产，我们一定不会责怪你们，因为我们都是阶级亲兄弟，因为你们中绝大部分是受资产阶级反动路线毒害的人，是受党内走资本主义道路当权派和顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线的人蒙蔽的革命群众。
    全市一切革命学生和革命的机关干部们！让我们和广大革命工人紧紧结合在一起，为了坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，广泛地开展宣传和斗争，更坚决地向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火，打垮资产阶级反动路线的一切新反扑，将工厂的无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新高潮！
    在伟大的毛泽东思想无限光芒照耀下，展望未来，革命前程灿烂辉煌。我们工人阶级、贫下中农、一切劳动者同革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部联合起来，共同努力，并肩战斗，乘胜前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    我们心中的红太阳、最最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
