The battle in the Gulf of Tonkin has attracted the attention of people all over the world. The waters of the Gulf of Tonkin link the blood ties between the peoples of China and Vietnam. The heroic deeds of the crew of the Chinese cargo ship 1018 in supporting Vietnam and resisting the United States are another triumphant song of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, echoing through the clouds.

Under the continuous bombing and strafing by American air pirates for three hours, they fought the enemy with an overwhelming spirit, bravely and tenaciously. Later, on the vast sea and on a desolate island, they overcame unimaginable difficulties and finally returned victorious to the motherland.

Their lofty spirit of dedicating themselves to socialism and the world revolution is a typical example of high internationalism, patriotism, and revolutionary heroism of the Chinese people in the era of Mao Zedong.

The great helmsman guides the battle course

On August 28, 1966, the 1018 and 1019 cargo ships, flying the flag of the People's Republic of China, set sail amidst the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao!" loaded with the friendship of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples.

The waves surged on the sea surface. The 1018 led the way, and the 1019 followed closely behind. The two ships cut through the waves and advanced towards their destination.

The ship fleet gradually disappeared into the night. Gazing ahead at the journey, the crew's thoughts surged like waves. The place they were heading to was where the battle between light and darkness was taking place. American imperialism was massacring the Vietnamese people, and the Soviet revisionist leadership and their accomplices were using various plots to try to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people. The heroic Vietnamese people were bravely fighting against American aggression and for national salvation.

The crew's hearts burned with hatred towards American imperialism and love for the Vietnamese people. Before setting sail, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works and reviewed Mao's teachings:

"All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the peoples of the world, be courageous, dare to fight, do not fear hardships, and press on wave upon wave. Then the whole world will surely belong to the people. All the ghosts and monsters will be routed."

They repeatedly denounced the bloody crimes of American imperialism in invading Vietnam, killing Vietnamese people, and repeatedly attacking Chinese merchant ships and fishing boats in the open sea.

They repeatedly expressed to the Party their determination to not fear hardship, not fear difficulty, and not fear death, and to be ready to sacrifice themselves for the world revolution at any time. They solemnly pledged to the Party:

"Mao Zedong Thought is our beacon. Comrade Norman Bethune is our example. No matter how great the risk, no matter how great the sacrifice, our determination to support Vietnam and resist the United States will never change."

The ship fleet advanced at high speed. The moon rose from the sea, and silver light shone everywhere. On the bridge, Political Commissar Chen Yongshang, Chief Captain Chen Dayang, and Captain Huang Bu San took turns using binoculars to carefully observe the sea surface and the direction indicated by the compass and map. The crew stood alert at their posts. The on-duty personnel once again accurately determined the ship's position: the 1018 cargo ship was advancing on the normal route in the western waters of the Gulf of Tonkin.

Suddenly, two flares were spotted in the front.

"Battle alert!" the on-duty driver signaled.

Everyone on the deck was alert, watching the night sky, and hearing the faint sound of planes on the sea.

"Comrades, stay alert, prepare for battle! Continue on the original course."

To fight to the end with the enemy

At 1:30 on August 29, continuous flares lit up the sea and sky like daylight. Two American pirate planes screamed down towards the cargo ship, followed by machine gun fire and bombs exploding near the ship's side, sending up high columns of water.

Amidst the deafening explosions, the loudspeaker transmitted Political Commissar Chen Yongshang's clear, firm, and calm voice:

"Comrades, the time to test us has come. The great Party, the great Chairman Mao, and we are together. We must fight to the end!"

This voice, burning with the passion of battle, was filled with hatred for the enemy, love for the motherland, and confidence in victory.

The cargo ship flying the five-star red flag was sacred territory of the motherland; the deck was the front line of supporting Vietnam and resisting the United States; great Mao Zedong Thought was our powerful weapon to defeat the American pirates. Individual lives could be sacrificed, but the dignity of the motherland could not be insulted.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Our Chinese nation has the spirit of fighting to the end with our enemies, the determination to restore our lost territory on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand among the nations of the world."

Standing firmly on the bridge, Chief Captain Chen Dayang glared at the enemy planes, continuously issuing orders to change the course, skillfully and flexibly countering the enemy planes' bombing and strafing.

The second officer Lin Rong turned the steering wheel with all his might. The cargo ship made a sharp turn to the right. The enemy planes missed, and the bombs fell into the sea.

After two minutes, the enemy planes dove down again. The cargo ship made another sharp turn, quickly heading to the left, and again avoided the enemy planes' strafing.

The heroic 1018 cargo ship thus bravely engaged with the enemy planes in the vast ocean, avoiding the enemy's firepower time and time again.

"Comrades, hold on!"

Political Commissar Chen Yongshang's steady and powerful voice boosted everyone's morale.

Communist Party members Cao Zhirong, Cai Jintang, Liang Huabao, and Xiong Yaozhang stood firmly on the pitching and rolling front and rear decks, using sharp eyes to track the enemy planes, bravely fighting on their posts.

In the hot and humid engine room, Communist Party member and Chief Engineer Li Siliang and Communist Party member Wu Qin, covered in sweat, focused on operating the machinery. When others offered to relieve them, they firmly said: "No, we can hold on." They ensured the machinery ran normally and changed speed in time according to the bell signals from the bridge, giving the speed required by the bridge.

The heroic 1018 cargo ship broke through the dense rain of bullets, advancing through the waves.

The American pirate planes bombed and strafed for more than an hour, finally retreating helplessly.

But the crew knew that the savage and cunning enemy would not give up so easily. A more severe battle was yet to come.

After more than thirty minutes, more enemy planes came in waves, continuously dropping a series of flares around the cargo ship.

At this moment, the sea and sky were ablaze. Machine gun fire, bombs, and rockets poured down on the 1018 like a storm.

Look, under the enemy planes' dive attacks, in the explosions of rockets, in the rising smoke and fire, the wounded first officer Xie Ruixu stood on the deck, directing the firefighting. Communist Party member and seaman captain Huang Dayao jumped into the smoke-filled hold, together with Li Datian and Huang Zhen'en, extinguishing the raging fire.

The radioman Huang Weichao calmly tapped the keys, using the fastest speed and most accurate code to call the motherland's radio station:

"I have an urgent report for you, I have an urgent report for you..."

Suddenly, a loud "clang" sounded, and the keys flew up. A violent shake, a puff of smoke rose from the front deck, followed by an explosion. The antenna was broken, and thick smoke covered the cargo ship.

The engine room was hit. The nineteen-year-old Young Communist League member Wang Xing rushed into the engine room, using all his strength to hold the ladder, rescuing the seriously injured Communist Party member Wu Qin onto the deck.

Communist Party member Li Datian, in the instant of the rocket explosion, immediately threw himself towards the wounded comrade. This hero who had turned Mao Zedong Thought into his soul, used his life to protect the safety of his class brother.

Smoke rose from the bridge. Chief Captain Chen Dayang and seaman captain Huang Dayao were thrown into the sea by the blast. Captain Huang Bu San, who was steering, was seriously injured, with his skull fractured. When he came out of his faint, the first thought that flashed through his mind was: steer the ship! He immediately, with astonishing willpower, stood up from the floor covered in blood, grabbed the steering wheel, and shouted: "Full speed ahead!"

But the machinery was damaged, and the steering wheel was ineffective. The ship's body tilted heavily to one side. The propeller blades tilted out of the water.

Head can be cut off, blood can be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned. Radioman Huang Weichao, holding the glowing "Quotations from Chairman Mao," rushed out of the radio room. The "Quotations from Chairman Mao" shone like lightning across the night sky, illuminating the roaring Gulf of Tonkin.

The sea wind howled, and the waves sparkled. When the ship was about to sink, Political Commissar Chen Yongshang walked across the tilted deck, bidding farewell to the martyred Communist Party members Li Datian, Li Siliang, Cao Zhirong, Cai Jintang, Wu Qin, and others.

Then, he took out his notebook, facing the sea, quickly and angrily wrote in the notebook, wrote...

He wrote a proclamation denouncing the heinous crimes of American imperialism: blood debts must be repaid in blood, the crimes of the American pirates will surely be punished a hundredfold!

He wrote a poem of the Chinese people in the era of Mao Zedong, with a spirit that shakes the mountains and rivers: heroes will forever live in the hearts of millions of people, their eternal lives will fight on in the Gulf of Tonkin!

Fighting in the waves

The 1019 cargo ship was injured.

The 1018 cargo ship sank. Political Commissar Chen Yongshang was the last to leave the ship. The wounded comrades who jumped into the sea first called out in the waves:

"Political Commissar... Political Commissar..."

The savage American air pirates attacked again, continuing to pursue the wounded crew members.

On the vast sea, although the crew members were still calling out for their political commissar, his voice could no longer be heard.

The night before departure, the political commissar earnestly educated his son, telling him to be the successor of the revolutionary cause. He said to his son: "I am working on maritime transportation at sea, fighting against American imperialism, and fighting against typhoons. Struggle will bring sacrifices, are you afraid?" The children replied: "We are not afraid, we will also serve the people when we grow up, and be good children of Chairman Mao."

Thinking of the martyred comrades, everyone could not help but shed hot tears. They thought: American imperialism can sink our ship, but it cannot blow away Mao Zedong Thought from our minds, nor can it shake our determination and resolve to support Vietnam and resist the United States. Everyone turned their sorrow into anger, their hatred into strength, and swam towards a nearby island.

Chief Captain Chen Dayang and Party branch committee member Huang Dayao, thrown into the sea by the blast, surfaced and grabbed a life buoy that floated by, bandaging each other's wounds, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations, and advancing with all their might. On the rolling waves, the voice of Mao Zedong Thought, which overcomes all difficulties, resonated.

"Determine to..."

One person recited the first sentence, charging forward.

"Fear no sacrifice..."

Another person tightly recited the second sentence, advancing through the waves.

"Overcome all difficulties..."

"Strive for victory."

At the same time, in another part of the sea, eight comrades who had jumped into the sea one after another were also exerting all their strength to push a small life raft, on which the unconscious Captain Huang Bu San lay.

The tide separated everyone, leaving only the young Communist Party member Xu Junrui and Xiong Yaozhang, insisting on pushing the life raft. Few people, heavy raft, strong wind and wave resistance, every step forward required immense effort. Xu Junrui was also wounded in thirty-one places, bleeding profusely, dizzy and nauseous, and his body ached from being soaked in seawater. But the great Mao Zedong Thought gave him the strength to overcome pain and selflessly save others.

He thought of Chairman Mao's teachings about "all revolutionary comrades should care for, love, and help each other," and said to himself: Chairman Mao, I will definitely follow your teachings. As long as I have a breath, I will save my class brother out of the sea.

At dawn, Huang Bu San woke up on the raft and urgently called out to his comrades. Xu Junrui firmly said:

"Captain, don't worry. We two are both Communist Party members. With us two here, you are here. We will definitely take you to the island!"

Rain and fog enveloped the sea surface, and the cold morning wind made them shiver, their legs cramping repeatedly. After fighting with the sea for several hours, they were no longer able to advance when they were still two kilometers away from the island.

At this critical moment, two enemy planes flew over the sea surface. At this crucial juncture, the image of our great leader Mao Zedong swimming in the Yangtze River shone before their eyes. They thought, Chairman Mao, at the age of seventy, still swam in the Yangtze River. Can't we young people break through the sea waves? The enemy wants to annihilate us without leaving a single person, this is a vain hope. We will go to avenge and annihilate the enemy!

Immediately, they seemed to see our great leader Mao Zedong appearing before them, calling out to them. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we will definitely break through the stormy waves and advance with you!

The island cannot hold back the heroic sons and daughters

The red sun rose from the east. The eleven heroic crew members, who had broken through the enemy's gunfire and waves, struggled for a long time, and at around 10:00 on August 29, successfully landed on a small island in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in different places.

This was a desolate island with no human trace. In front of them were jagged rocks, steep cliffs, prickly thorns, dense wild vines, and shrub forests.

Here, there was no food, no fresh water, no clothes, and no medicine. Pain, hunger, cold, mosquitoes, and large ants constantly tormented the crew members.

The savage American air pirates continued to pursue and bomb the island...

The heroic crew members faced another serious test.

"We must see our achievements and see the light in times of difficulty."

The crew members loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations, feeling more deeply than ever the immense power of Mao's teachings. Great Mao Zedong Thought, in times of hunger, was more important than food; in times of cold, was warmer than fire; in times of pain, was more effective than medicine.

Communist Party members always stood at the forefront of the struggle. That afternoon, a party small group meeting was held. They analyzed the situation at hand, believing that the most important thing at present was to remember Chairman Mao's teachings, play the exemplary role of Communist Party members, care for comrades, unite comrades, and encourage everyone to fight against difficulties.

A crew meeting began on the island. Chief Captain Chen Dayang excitedly said:

"Comrades, the enemy's bombing cannot frighten us, the surging waves cannot stop us, we have won!"

The comrades spoke one after another. Branch committee member Huang Dayao said:

"Although we are now on a desolate island, we are not alone. Behind us are seven hundred million people of the motherland; in front of us are thirty million Vietnamese people. We will definitely return to the motherland, return to Chairman Mao's side."

The crew members, in the face of the enemy, were brave warriors; in the face of difficulties, they were iron men. With nothing to drink, they drank rainwater collected in rock pits; with nothing to eat, they found wild fruits in the forest and sea snails on the beach. In extreme hardship, they were filled with high revolutionary optimism. They said humorously: "We not only have mountain delicacies but also seafood. Now we can fight a protracted battle with the enemy."

Night fell. The sea wind blew, and the cold pierced to the bone. Everyone lay on the damp forest floor, covered with tree branches and leaves, huddled together in pairs, using their body heat to warm their comrades' bodies.

"We need to hear the voice of the motherland, Chairman Mao's voice the most at this moment."

"In my life, my greatest wish is to see our great leader Chairman Mao."

Chairman Mao, beloved Chairman Mao! You shine like the morning sun over the world. At this moment, although we are thousands of miles away from you, your radiant light illuminates our path of struggle.

Motherland! Dear motherland! In the midst of the Cultural Revolution, your vast land is now boiling with new life. At this moment, everyone involuntarily sang their most beloved song: "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsman."

The resounding song flew over the forest, over the sea, echoing in the Gulf of Tonkin.

Just as everyone was singing and talking, the enemy planes flew towards the island again, dropping bombs. At this time, on the other side of the island, the heroic Vietnamese people were using fierce artillery fire to intercept the American air pirates. An American plane, trailing a long flame, bloomed in the sky.

Everyone immediately clapped and cheered: "Well done! Well done!"

Facing the battle, the comrades' hatred for the enemy increased. Branch committee member Huang Dayao said:

"If the enemy comes, stones and sticks will be our weapons, the island's forest will be our battlefield to fight guerrilla warfare against the enemy!"

The comrades said: "Right! We will fight to the end with the enemy!"

At night, the sea tide crashed against the rocks on the shore, making a roaring sound. Communist Party member Liang Huabao and radioman Huang Weichao, bare-chested and covered with leaves, stood guard on the island. They would rather stand more shifts themselves than wake up the sleeping comrades.

The comrades were often awakened by the large ants crawling on their bodies. At this time, they thought not of their own pain but of the seriously injured Captain Huang Bu San hidden in another cave.

The twenty-four-year-old Communist Party member Xiong Yaozhang represented everyone in often taking care of Huang Bu San. Each time he went, he had to pass through thorns and climb over steep rocks. His feet were worn out, his hands were pierced, and his chest and back were covered with bloody scratches, but he still walked forward with a bamboo tube of fresh water in one hand and wild fruits in the other, leaving a trail of blood with each step.

This "Living Lei Feng" on the island, the son of a poor peasant, always cared for others. On the island, when he found fresh water and wild fruits, he did not eat or drink them first but sent them to his comrades. As soon as he landed on the island, he took off his only piece of clothing and gave it to the wounded, leaving himself bare-chested and blue from the cold, still patting his chest and saying: "Don't look at my skin turning blue, my heart is on fire!"

Xiong Yaozhang gently supported the captain on his chest, feeding him water mouthful by mouthful. Huang Bu San, upon waking, anxiously asked him:

"Little Bear, have all the comrades landed on the island?"

"All have. Captain, we will definitely return to the motherland."

With thirty-five wounds, Huang Bu San's life was in danger, but he still cared for his comrades and the motherland. At the age of twelve, he worked as a child laborer for the fishery boss at sea, and it was the Party and Chairman Mao who saved him from the sea of suffering, nurturing him from an ordinary fisherman into a captain. This hero, like Ma Xian, with astonishing willpower and indomitable spirit, struggled tenaciously with pain, hunger, and cold on the island under the care of his comrades. When he woke up in the sound of enemy bombing, he repeatedly encouraged himself:

"Dear Chairman Mao, no matter how vicious the enemy is, I will definitely hold on."

Breaking through the stormy waves to cross the strait

How to leave the island? How to return to the beloved motherland? The only way was to swim to a larger island on the opposite side and contact the Vietnamese people.

The island and the large island were separated by a ten-kilometer strait. Here, the unpredictable tides, sharks, and enemy planes hovering around could pose a threat to swimmers at any time.

The sea could not stop the fearless warriors, and the waves could not frighten the revolutionary spirit. Communist Party member Liang Huabao heard the voice of our great leader Mao Zedong:

"We die for the people, and it is a worthy death." Yes! Now is the time for me to dedicate myself to the revolution. Thinking of this, he immediately found Party branch committee member Huang Dayao and firmly said:

"Please approve me to swim over and contact the Vietnamese people."

Young Communist League member Wang Xing, although not a good swimmer, had a heart that was completely and thoroughly dedicated to the people. He said:

"My injury is light. I should go!"

To facilitate mutual care, it was decided that the two of them would swim across the sea together. At 8:00 on the morning of August 30, the two heroes set out. Comrades came to the shore to see them off:

"Comrades, we wish you to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory!"

"We are Communist Party members and Young Communist League members. No matter how great the difficulties, we will complete the mission to the death!"

They advanced in the waves. The sea strait, with its changing winds and waves, blew stronger and stronger. Suddenly, the sky was filled with dark clouds, and the rain beat down so hard that they could not open their eyes. The giant waves threw them into the troughs and then lifted them high.

At this critical moment, Liang Huabao quickly swam to Wang Xing's side, hugging his exhausted comrade and saying:

"We must hold on, we must overcome all difficulties and strive for victory!"

The physically weaker Wang Xing could no longer advance in the swirling currents. He asked Liang Huabao to swim ahead first.

"No, I cannot leave you behind!"

Liang Huabao, with deep affection for his class brother, immediately untied a strap from his life jacket and handed it to Wang Xing:

"Come, I'll pull you along!"

Liang Huabao's armpits had already been worn raw by the edges of the life jacket. But he endured the pain with unyielding willpower, dragging his comrade for several hours. In the evening, seeing that the tide was about to recede and they were still far from the large island, Wang Xing thought that if they continued like this, both of them would not be able to swim across the strait. He absolutely could not let personal reasons drag down his comrade, so he told Liang Huabao again:

"You go ahead first! Now you are only helping one person, but if you swim to the island, you will save more comrades!"

Liang Huabao, although torn inside, thought of the safety of all the comrades on the island and turned back, tightly holding Wang Xing's hand and encouraging him:

"You must resolutely swim forward. If you really can't make it, returning to the island is also our victory."

Wang Xing and Liang Huabao parted ways and continued to swim forward. The next morning, Wang Xing was pushed back to the original island by the tide. At this time, after struggling in the sea for a full twenty-five hours, he was pale all over and could not speak. Lin Rong and Xie Ruixu, who were watching from the island, took off their clothes and put them on him, tightly hugging him, warming him with their body heat, and feeding him wild fruits and fresh water, saving him with high-class solidarity.

The crew members left on the island waited for a day and a night but did not see the signal that Liang Huabao had successfully swum across. On the morning of the 31st, everyone decided to send someone to cross the strait again.

Huang Weichao, Huang Zhen'en, Chen Dayang, Huang Dayao, Xu Junrui, and Xiong Yaozhang set out in batches, riding the waves.

The unpredictable tides separated the crew members crossing the sea. Some were pushed back to the original island by the tide, and some were washed onto other small islands. Communist Party member Xiong Yaozhang sacrificed his life for the motherland in the stormy waves.

In this crossing, Huang Zhen'en fought with the waves for fifteen hours before being washed onto a small island to the west. In the five days and nights on the small island, he tenaciously struggled and fought. During this period, he mustered his greatest courage to cross the sea several times, although he did not succeed, his determination and confidence to return to the motherland never wavered.

He had not eaten a grain of rice for several days and nights, his intestines ached severely, and hunger seriously threatened his life. He told himself: "As long as my heart is still beating, I will continue to struggle until I stop breathing." At this time, he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings:

"This army has the spirit of advancing without fear of death. It will trample all enemies and will never be subdued by the enemy. No matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person, this person must continue to fight."

His mind's eye showed the scene of the Red Army during the Long March, eating grass roots and tree bark for the revolution. He thought: what the revolutionary forebears could eat, why can't I? He gave himself an order:

"Eat leaves for the revolution!"

He found leaves, mixed them with water, and rubbed them into a pulp, swallowing them mouthful by mouthful. On September 5, on the eighth day after leaving the ship, just as he was preparing to cross the sea for the fourth time, the Vietnamese people who had come to find him finally found him.

Unforgettable Sino-Vietnamese friendship

After struggling for a whole day on September 30, Liang Huabao arrived at the shore of the large island at around 9:00 in the evening. He fainted on the shallow beach and woke up without the strength to stand. He could only let the waves push him a little and crawl a step forward, like this, wave by wave, step by step, he finally reached the sandbank and found the Vietnamese people the next day.

The heroic deeds of the Chinese crew members fighting against enemy planes, hunger, pain, and the sea quickly spread across the island. That night, the Vietnamese military and people, braving the hovering enemy planes, brought food and medicine, driving small boats towards the island to welcome their comrades and brothers.

When the brothers of the two countries met on the island, the Vietnamese comrades immediately took off their clothes and shoes to give to the Chinese comrades, and the female soldiers untied their headscarves to drape over the shoulders of the Chinese comrades. Medical personnel re-bandaged their wounds and provided emergency treatment. The commander Nguyen No excitedly said to the Chinese comrades:

"Chinese comrades! You have come to Vietnam, and you are at home. You have made sacrifices for the Vietnamese people, you are truly brave!"

The blood ties of the Vietnamese comrades warmed the hearts of the crew members. Chen Dayang could not contain his excitement and sang the Vietnamese song "Liberate the South" in Vietnamese. He sang, and the Vietnamese comrades immediately joined in.

The song echoed through the hearts of the heroic sons and daughters of the two countries, overflowing with brotherly battle friendship.

"Chinese comrades have come!"

Wherever the Chinese comrades went, the Vietnamese people welcomed them as if they were their own victorious heroes, with the warmest and most intimate hospitality. Men, women, old, and young all rushed to the streets, waving and cheering at them. An old woman with white hair gently stroked the crew members' wounds, tears streaming down her face, saying:

"You have shed blood and sacrificed for us, you are truly good comrades educated by Chairman Mao!"

The Vietnamese people offered the best food to the Chinese comrades. When Huang Zhen'en, who had not eaten a grain of rice for seven days and seven nights, received the hot rice from the Vietnamese comrades, he could not help but shed tears.

On the Vietnamese mainland, the crew members of the 1018 cargo ship and the crew members of the 1019 cargo ship, which had successfully reached its destination, were warmly received by the local government officials of Vietnam. The wounded comrades received proper treatment. Representatives from the Chinese Embassy also rushed from Hanoi to convey the concern of Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland. The Vietnamese comrades also held a warm reception for them, and they praised the Chinese sailors at the meeting:

"You are truly good warriors nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. With the support of the Chinese people and the people of the world, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve the final victory in the anti-American, national salvation struggle!"

The representative of the Chinese crew members, in his speech, warmly thanked the Vietnamese government and people for their concern. He said:

"Chairman Mao teaches us that supporting Vietnam and resisting the United States is our internationalist duty. The Vietnamese people are a heroic people, and the Vietnamese nation is a heroic nation. We firmly support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their just struggle against American aggression and for national salvation to the end, until the last American aggressor is driven out of Vietnamese territory."

On the night before their return, September 5, they heard the announcer of the motherland's radio station, with a voice as strong as steel, broadcasting the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense of our country on the American pirate planes' brazen bombing and sinking of our 1018 and 1019 small cargo ships:

"We once again solemnly warn the American aggressors that blood debts must be repaid in blood. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never tolerate the arbitrary actions of American imperialism. We have said it before, and we mean what we say. If American imperialism dares to impose war on us, we will mercilessly break the backbone of the American aggressors and completely, thoroughly, and cleanly annihilate them."

    战斗在北部湾上
    ——记“南海英雄船”一○一八号货船的英雄事迹
    北部湾的战火，吸引着全世界人民的关注。
    北部湾的海水，联结着中越两国人民血肉的情谊。
    战斗在北部湾上的我国一○一八号货船船员们援越抗美的英雄事迹，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌。
    他们在美国空中强盗连续三个小时的轰炸扫射下，以压倒一切敌人的英雄气概，英勇顽强地与敌人展开斗争。后来，在大海上，在荒岛上，又战胜了难以想像的困难，终于胜利地回到祖国。
    他们一心献身社会主义祖国和世界革命的崇高精神，是毛泽东时代中华儿女高度国际主义、爱国主义和革命英雄主义的典型。
      伟大舵手指引着战斗的航程
    一九六六年八月二十八日，一○一八号、一○一九号两艘小型货船，悬挂着中华人民共和国国旗，在“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声中，满载中越人民的友谊，离港出发了。
    波涛汹涌的海面上，一○一八号走在前面，一○一九号跟着驶进。两船迎风劈浪，向目的港前进。
    船队逐渐消失在黑夜中。展望眼前的航行，船员们思如潮涌。他们要去的地方，正进行着光明与黑暗的决战。美帝国主义在屠杀越南人民，苏联修正主义领导集团和它们的合伙者，正使用种种阴谋，力图扑灭越南人民的革命烈火。英雄的越南人民，正进行着英勇的抗美救国的斗争。
    船员们的胸中燃烧着对美帝国主义的仇恨，对越南人民的爱，在出海前，一次又一次地学习毛主席著作，重温着毛主席的教导：
      “全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    他们一次又一次地愤怒控诉美帝国主义侵略越南，杀害越南人民，在公海上多次袭击我国商船、渔船的血腥罪行。
    他们一次又一次地向党表示，不怕苦，不怕难，不怕死，随时准备献身世界革命的决心。他们向党庄严宣誓：
      “毛泽东思想是我们的灯塔。白求恩同志是我们的榜样。不管有多大风险，不怕有多大牺牲，我们援越抗美的决心永不变。”
    船队在高速度前进。月亮浮出大海，到处银光闪闪。聚集在驾驶台上的政委陈永尚、指导船长陈大瑛、船长黄不三，一会拿起望远镜，聚精会神地了望远处，仔细观察着海面，一会俯视着海图和罗经指示的航向。船员们精神抖擞地守着自己的岗位。值班人员又一次精确地测定了船位：一○一八号货船，正在北部湾西部海面的正常航线上，向前挺进。
    突然，在正前方发现两颗照明弹。
    “战斗警报！”值班驾驶员发出讯号。
    甲板上的人全都警惕地注视着夜空，听到海上隐隐传来的飞机声。
    “同志们，提高警惕，准备战斗！继续照原航线前进。”
    要同敌人血战到底
    八月二十九日一时三十分，连续不断的照明弹把海空照得如同白昼。两架美国强盗飞机，啸叫着径直向货船俯冲下来，紧接着机关炮弹、炸弹在船舷外边爆炸开来，激起高高的水柱。
    震聋耳鼓的爆炸声中，扩音器里，传出政委陈永尚宏亮、坚定、沉着的声音：
      “同志们，考验我们的时刻到了。伟大的党，伟大的毛主席，和我们在一起。我们一定要战斗到底！”
    这燃烧着战斗激情的声音，充满着对敌人的仇恨，对祖国的热爱和对胜利的信心。
    飘扬着五星红旗的货船，就是祖国神圣的领土；甲板就是援越抗美的前沿阵地；伟大的毛泽东思想是我们战胜美国强盗的强大武器。个人的生命可以牺牲，祖国的尊严决不可侮。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”
    巍然站在驾驶台上的指导船长陈大瑛，怒目追踪敌机，不断发出改换行驶方向的舵令，指挥货船，机智灵活地对付着敌机的轰炸扫射。
    操舵的二副林荣同志用全身力气急速地转动舵轮。货船跟着一个急转弯，向右方驶去。敌机扑空了，炸弹落在大海里。
    过两分钟，敌机又俯冲下来。货船又一个急转弯，快速向左方驶去，又避过了敌机的扫射。
    英雄的一○一八号货船，就这样像暴风雨中的海燕，勇敢地和敌机周旋在辽阔的海洋上。一次又一次地避开敌机的火力。
    “同志们，顶住它！”
    政委陈永尚同志沉着有力的声音，鼓舞着大家的斗志。
    监视海空的共产党员曹志荣、蔡锦堂、梁华保、熊耀章等同志，屹立在颠簸摇摆的前后甲板上，用锐利的目光追踪着敌机，在岗位上英勇地战斗着。
    高温闷热的机舱里，共产党员、轮机长李嗣濂和共产党员伍钦，浑身汗水，全神贯注地操纵着机器。别人要替换他们，他们坚定地说：“不，我们能够坚持。”他们始终保证机器正常运转，及时按照驾驶台传来的车钟声，不断变换车速，驾驶台要什么速度，他们就给什么速度。
    英雄的一○一八号货船，穿过密集弹雨，乘胜破浪前进。
    美国强盗飞机轮番轰炸扫射一个多小时，最后无可奈何地溜掉了。
    但是，船员们知道，残暴狡猾的敌人，决不会就此甘心。更严重的战斗还在后面。
    过了三十多分钟，更多的敌机，连续不断地袭来，在货船的前后左右，同时丢下一连串的照明弹。
    这时候，海天之间，一片火光。机关炮弹、炸弹和火箭，暴雨似的向一○一八号货船倾泻下来。
    看吧，在敌机的俯冲攻击下，在火箭的爆炸中，在腾起的火烟里，负伤的大副谢瑞余，挺立在甲板上，指挥进行灭火战斗。共产党员、水手长黄大瑶，跳进火烟弥漫的货舱，和黎达才、黄灼恩同志一起，扑灭了冲腾的烈火。
    报务员黄伟超镇定地按着电键，用最快的速度，最准确的电码，向祖国的电台呼唤：
    “我有特急报给你，我有特急报给你……”。
    突然，“咣啷”一声，电键抛了起来。一阵猛烈的震动，前甲板上腾起一股火烟，接着就听到一声爆炸。天线断了，浓烟遮罩着货船。
    机舱中弹了。十九岁的共青团员王星，冲进机舱，使出全身气力，把着扶梯，把身负重伤的共产党员伍钦救上甲板。
    共产党员黎达才，在火箭爆炸的瞬间，立即扑向身边的伤员。这个把毛泽东思想化为自己灵魂的英雄，用自己的生命，保住了阶级兄弟的安全。
    驾驶台腾起了浓烟。指导船长陈大瑛、水手长黄大瑶，被爆炸的气浪抛向大海。正在操舵的船长黄不三，身负重伤，颅骨破裂。当他从昏迷中醒来时，闪过脑子的第一个念头是：开船！他立刻以惊人的毅力，带着满身的鲜血，从地板上站立起来，把住舵轮高喊：“开快车！”
    但是，机器坏了，舵轮失去了作用。船身严重地倾斜向一边。推进器轮叶翘出了水面。
    头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢。报务员黄伟超拿着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，从报务房冲出来。《毛主席语录》像划破夜空的闪电，照耀着雷声震怒的北部湾。
    海风呼啸，波光闪闪。在船快要沉没的时候，政委陈永尚走过倾斜的甲板，向英勇牺牲的共产党员黎达才、李嗣濂、曹志荣、蔡锦堂、伍钦等烈士告别。
    接着，他拿出笔记本，面对大海，急速地愤怒地在笔记本上写，写……。
    他写的是，声讨美帝国主义滔天罪行的檄文：血债要用血来还，美国强盗的罪恶，定将得到加倍的惩罚！
    他写的是，毛泽东时代中华儿女气壮山河的诗篇：英雄们永远活在亿万人民的心里，他们永恒的生命战斗在北部湾！
      搏斗在骇浪中的海鹰
    一○一九号货船受伤了。
    一○一八号货船沉没了。政委陈永尚最后一个离船。先跳下海的受伤同志，在海涛中呼唤：
    “政委……政委……。”
    “同志们，我在这里……。”
    穷凶极恶的美国空中强盗又一次袭来，继续追踪我负伤的船员。
      在茫茫大海上，虽然船员们还在呼喊着他们的政委，但再也听不到政委的声音了。
      出航前的晚上，政委谆谆教育他的儿子，要做革命事业的接班人。他对儿子说：“我在海上搞运输工作，要和美帝国主义斗争，要和台风作斗争。斗争就会有牺牲，你们怕不怕？”孩子们回答：“我们不怕，我们长大了也要和爸爸一样，为人民服务，做毛主席的好孩子。”
    想到牺牲的烈士，同志们禁不住洒下了热泪。他们想：美帝国主义能炸沉我们的船，但绝不能炸掉我们头脑里的毛泽东思想，动摇不了我们援越抗美的意志和决心。大家把悲痛化作愤怒，把仇恨变成力量，游向附近的海岛。
    被爆炸气浪打到海里的指导船长陈大瑛、党支部委员黄大瑶，泅出海面，抓住漂来的一个救生圈，相互包扎伤口，念着毛主席语录，拚尽全力前进。滚滚波涛上，响着压倒一切的毛泽东思想的声音。
    “下定决心，”一个人念第一句，向前冲去。
    “不怕牺牲，”又一个人紧念第二句，破浪前进。
    “排除万难，”
    “去争取胜利。”
    同一时刻，在另一处海面上，先后下海的八位同志，也正竭尽全力推着一只小救生筏，筏上躺着昏迷不醒的黄不三船长。
    海潮把大家冲散了，只剩下青年共产党员许均瑞和熊耀章，坚持推着救生筏。人少、筏重、风浪阻力大，每前进一步，都要付出极大的气力。许均瑞又身负三十一处伤，流血过多，头晕眼花，加上海水浸泡，周身剧痛。但是，伟大的毛泽东思想给了他战胜伤痛，舍己救人的无穷力量。
    他想起毛主席关于“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助”的教导，对自己说：毛主席呵，毛主席，我一定遵照您的教导，只要我有一口气，就要把阶级兄弟救出大海。
    天亮时，黄不三在筏上苏醒过来，急切地喊着同志们。许均瑞坚决地说：
    “船长，你放心。我们两个人都是共产党员，有我们两个在，就有你在，一定把你送到岛上去！”
    雨雾笼罩着海面，寒冷的晨风，吹得他们浑身发抖，双腿不断抽筋。连续跟大海搏斗了几个小时之后，他们在离海岛还有两公里的地方，再也无力前进了。
    这时，有两架敌机掠过海面。在这紧要关头，我们伟大领袖毛主席畅游长江的光辉形象，闪现在他们眼前。他们想，毛主席他老人家七十多岁了，还畅游长江，我们青年人难道就不能冲过海浪？敌人想一个不留的消灭我们，这是妄想。我们要去报仇，去消灭敌人！
    立刻，他们仿佛看到伟大领袖毛主席出现在眼前，在向他们召唤。毛主席，毛主席，我们一定闯过大风大浪，跟您前进！
    荒岛困不住英雄儿女
    红日从东方升起。冲过敌人枪林弹雨、踏破千层骇浪的十一位英雄船员，经过长时间的搏斗，在八月二十九日十点多，先后在不同地点，胜利地登上了越南民主共和国的一个小海岛。
    这是个渺无人烟的荒岛。眼前到处是嶙峋的礁石，陡峭的山岩，刺人的荆棘，茂密的野藤和灌木林。
    这里，没有食物，没有淡水，没有衣服，没有药物。伤痛、饥饿、寒冷和蚊子、大蚂蚁，时刻折磨着船员们。
    野蛮的美国空中强盗，继续跟踪追寻，向荒岛扫射、轰炸……。
    英雄船员们又一次面临着严重的考验。
    “我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”
    船员们高声背诵着毛主席的语录，比任何时候都更深切地感受到毛主席教导的无比威力。伟大的毛泽东思想，在他们饥饿的时候，比粮食更重要；寒冷的时候，比火更温暖；伤痛的时候，比药更灵验。
    共产党员总是站在斗争的最前线。当天下午召开了党的小组会。他们分析了面临的形势，认为当前最要紧的是，牢记毛主席的教导，发挥共产党员的模范带头作用，关心同志，团结同志，鼓励大家为战胜困难而斗争。
    一次船员大会在荒岛上开始了。指导船长陈大瑛兴奋地说：
    “同志们，敌人的轰炸吓不倒我们，惊涛骇浪挡不住我们，我们胜利了！”
    同志们纷纷发言。支部委员黄大瑶说：
    “现在我们虽然身在荒岛，但我们并不孤单。我们的背后，有七亿祖国人民；我们的面前，有三千万越南人民。我们一定能回到祖国，回到毛主席身边。”
    船员们，在敌人面前，是勇敢的战士，在困难面前，是铁打的硬汉。没有喝的，他们喝石头坑里积存的雨水；没有吃的，他们到丛林中找来野果，到海边捡来海蛎。在极度困苦的情况下，充满高度革命乐观主义精神。他们风趣地说：“我们不但有山珍，还有海味，这下我们可以跟敌人打持久战了。”
    黑夜降临了。海风吹来，寒冷彻骨。大家在潮湿的丛林地上，盖着树枝树叶，三三两两，背靠背地睡在一起，互相用体温温暖着战友的身躯。
    “现在我们最需要听到祖国的声音，毛主席的声音。”  
    “我这一辈子最大的愿望，就是希望能看到伟大领袖毛主席。”
    毛主席，敬爱的毛主席！您像一轮朝阳普照着全世界。在这一时刻，我们虽然离您万里，可是您的万丈光芒，却照亮着我们斗争的前程。
    祖国！亲爱的祖国！前进在文化大革命高潮中的祖国，在这一时刻，您宽阔的大地上，亿万人民正在火热地战斗着、劳动着、工作着，到处沸腾着新的生活。这时大家情不自禁地唱起了最心爱的歌：《大海航行靠舵手》。
    宏亮的歌声，飞过密林，飞过海洋，回荡在北部湾上。
    正当大家唱着谈着的时候，敌机又向荒岛飞来，丢下了炸弹。这时海岛对面的越南大陆上，英雄的越南人民正用猛烈的炮火，迎击着美国空中强盗。一架美国飞机拖着长长的火焰，在空中开花了。
    大家立刻拍手欢呼起来：“打得好！打得好！”
    面对着战火，同志们更增加了对敌人的仇恨。党支部委员黄大瑶说：
    “如果有敌人来，石头、木棒就是我们的武器，海岛丛林，就是我们同敌人打游击的战场！”
    同志们说：“对！要和敌人干到底！”
    深夜，海潮冲击着海边的礁石，哗哗地发出响声。共产党员梁华保和报务员黄伟超，光着上身，披着树叶，警惕地守卫在荒岛上。他们宁可自己多站几班岗，也不愿叫醒熟睡的同志们。
    同志们不时被爬满身上的大蚂蚁咬醒。这时，他们想到的不是自己的伤痛，而是隐蔽在另一处石洞里的重伤员黄不三船长。
    二十四岁的共产党员熊耀章，代表大家经常去照顾黄不三。每去一次，都得穿过荆棘，越过陡岩。他的脚磨烂了，手扎破了，胸前背后划破一道道血口子，可是他仍然一手用竹筒提着淡水，一手捧着野果，一步一个血印地向前走着。
    这个被称为岛上“活雷锋”的贫农儿子，处处关心别人。在岛上，找到淡水、野果，他不先喝先吃，而是先送给同志。一上岛，他就把仅有的一件衣服，脱给伤员，自己日夜光着身子，冻得浑身发紫，还拍着胸脯说：“别看我皮肤发紫，心里可挺热火！”
    熊耀章把船长轻轻扶在胸前，一口一口地喂水给他喝。黄不三一醒来，就关切地问他说：
    “小熊，同志们都上岛了吗？”
    “全上来了。船长，我们一定能回到祖国。”
    身负三十五处伤的黄不三，生命危在旦夕，但他仍惦念着同志，惦念着祖国。他十二岁就在海上给渔霸当童工，是党和毛主席把他从苦海中解救出来，从一个普通的渔民培养成船长。这个麦贤得式的英雄，以惊人的毅力，倔强的意志，在同志们的关照下，在荒岛上，坚持与伤痛、饥饿、寒冷作顽强的斗争。当他在敌机的轰炸声中醒来时，不断鼓励自己说：
    “亲爱的毛主席，不管敌人怎样凶恶，我一定要坚持下去。”
    闯过狂风巨浪横渡海峡
    怎样离开荒岛？怎样回到亲爱的祖国？唯一的办法，是泅渡到对面的一个大岛，和越南人民取得联系。
    荒岛和大岛之间相隔十公里的海峡。这里，流向不定的潮汐，出没的鲨鱼，不断盘旋的敌机，随时都会给泅渡者带来生命危险。
    大海挡不住无畏的勇士，恶浪吓不倒革命的雄心。共产党员梁华保，耳边响起伟大领袖毛主席的声音：
  “我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”对！现在就是我为革命献身的时候。想到这里，他顿时热血沸腾，立刻找到党支部委员黄大瑶，坚决地说：
    “请批准我游过去，去找越南人民联系。”
    共青团员王星，虽然水性不好，但他有一颗完全、彻底为人民服务的心。他说：
    “我的伤轻。应当是我去！”
    为了便于相互照顾，决定派他俩一同跨海出征。八月三十日清晨八时，两位勇士出发了。同志们来到海边为他们送行：
    “同志们，祝你们排除万难，去争取胜利！”
    “请放心，我们是共产党员和共青团员。不管有多大困难，誓死也要完成任务！”
    他们在波浪中前进。风云多变的海峡，海风越吹越猛。顷刻，乌云满天，暴雨打得人睁不开眼睛。巨浪一下子把他们摔进浪谷，一下子又把他们高高抬起。
    在这险恶的时刻，梁华保迅速游到王星身边，抱着精疲力竭的战友说：
    “我们一定要坚持住，一定要排除万难，去争取胜利！”
    体质较弱的王星，在左右回旋的海流中，再也无力前进了。他要求梁华保先游过去。
    “不，我不能把你丢下！”
    对阶级兄弟情深似海的梁华保，这时毅然解下自己救生衣上的一根带子，递给王星：
    “来，我拉着你游去！”
    梁华保的两腋，早已被救生衣的边缘磨烂了。但他仍忍着剧痛，以顽强的毅力，拖着自己的战友，游了几个小时。傍晚，眼看就要退潮，而离大岛还很远。王星想，这样下去两个人都会游不过海峡，绝对不能因为个人，拖累了战友，他再次对梁华保说：
    “你先游吧！现在你帮助的只是我一个人，如果你游过去，就会救出更多的同志！”
    梁华保虽然心里非常矛盾，但想到岛上全体同志的生命安全，便回过身来，紧紧握住王星的手，鼓励他说：
    “你一定要坚决向前游。实在游不到，退回荒岛，也是我们的胜利。”
    王星和梁华保分别后，继续往前游。第二天上午，王星又被潮水冲回原荒岛。这时，他经过在海上整整二十五个小时的搏斗，已经全身发白，说不出话。正在岛边了望的林荣和谢瑞余，脱下衣服给他穿上，紧紧地把他抱在怀里，用自己的体温温暖他，用野果和淡水喂他，以高度的阶级友爱把他抢救了过来。
    留在岛上的船员们，等了一天一夜，没有看到梁华保泅渡成功的信号。三十一日清晨，大家决定派人继续横渡海峡。
    黄伟超、黄灼恩、陈大瑛、黄大瑶、许均瑞、熊耀章，分批跨着海浪出征了。
    流向不定的潮流，把渡海的同志们冲散了。有的被潮水推回原岛，有的被冲到了别的小荒岛上。共产党员熊耀章，在狂风巨浪中为祖国献出了生命。
    在这次泅渡中，黄灼恩同海浪搏斗十五个小时后，被冲上了西边一个小荒岛。在小岛的五天五夜中，他始终顽强地坚持着、斗争着。在这期间，他曾鼓起最大勇气几次渡海，虽然都没有成功，但从未动摇过回到祖国的决心和信心。
    他几天几夜没有吃过一粒粮食，肠胃剧烈地疼痛，饥饿严重威胁着他的生命。他对自己说：“只要我的心脏还在跳动，我就要继续斗争，直到停止呼吸。”这时，他想起了毛主席的教导：
    “这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”
    他的眼前出现了当年红军长征时为革命吃草根、吃树皮的情景。他想：革命前辈能吃的东西，我为什么不能吃呢？他向自己下了一道命令：
    “为革命吃树叶！”
    他把树叶找来，混在水里，用手搓烂，大口大口地吞下去。九月五日，在他离船后的第八天，正当他准备第四次渡海时，前去寻找他的越南人民终于找到了他。
    难忘的中越人民友谊
    经过三十日一整天的搏斗，梁华保在晚上九点多钟游到了大岛海边，他还没有上岛就晕倒在浅滩上，醒来他已经没有力量站起。只能乘海浪推一下，向前爬一步，这样一浪一步，终于上了沙滩，在第二天找到了越南军民。
    中国船员同敌机、饥饿、伤痛和大海作斗争的英雄事迹，迅速传遍了全岛。当天晚上，越南军民冒着盘旋的敌机，带着食物和药品，驾着一艘艘小船驶向荒岛，迎接自己的战友和兄弟。
    当中越两国兄弟在海岛上会合的时候，越南同志立刻脱下自己的衣服、鞋子给中国同志穿，女民兵解下自己的头巾，披在中国同志肩上。医务人员给他们重新包扎伤口，进行抢救。队长阮诺激动地对中国同志说：
    “中国同志！你们到了越南，就是到了自己家里。你们为越南人民作出了牺牲，你们真勇敢！”
    越南同志的血肉情谊，像一股暖流温暖着船员们的心。陈大瑛抑制不住内心的激动，用越南话唱起了《解放南方》的越南歌曲。他一唱，越南同志立刻跟着唱起来。
    歌声，激荡着中越两国英雄儿女的心，洋溢着兄弟的战斗的情谊。
    “中国同志来了！”
    中国同志走到哪里，哪里的越南人民就像欢迎自己胜利归来的英雄一样，最热烈而亲切地接待他们。男女老少都涌向街头，向他们招手欢呼，一位白发苍苍的老大娘轻轻抚摸着船员们的伤口，流着热泪说：
    “你们为了我们流血牺牲，你们真是毛主席教育出来的好同志呵！”
    越南人民拿出最好吃的东西款待中国同志。当七天七夜没有吃过一粒米的黄灼恩，接过越南同志送来的热饭时，他禁不住流下了热泪。
    在越南大陆上，一○一八号货船的船员们和胜利到达目的港的一○一九号货船的船员们，受到了越南地方政府负责人的亲切慰问，伤员们得到了妥善的治疗。中国大使馆的代表，也专程从河内赶来，向他们转达了毛主席和祖国人民对他们的关怀。越南同志还为他们举行了热情的招待会，他们在会上赞扬中国海员说：
    “你们不愧为毛泽东思想哺育的好战士，是中华民族的优秀儿女。越南人民在中国人民和世界人民支援下，一定能取得抗美救国事业的最后胜利！”
    中国船员代表在讲话的时候，热烈地感谢越南政府和人民对他们的关怀。他说：
    “毛主席教导我们，援越抗美是我们应尽的国际主义义务。越南人民是英雄的人民，越南民族是英雄的民族。我们坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国的正义斗争进行到底，直到美国侵略者一个不留地滚出越南国土。”
    他们在回国的前夜，九月五日晚上，听到祖国电台的播音员，正以钢铁一般的声音，播送着我国国防部发言人，就美国强盗飞机悍然炸沉炸伤我一○一八号、一○一九号小型货船，发表的声明：
    “我们再次严重警告美国侵略者，血债必须用血来还。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，决不能听任美帝国主义胡作非为。我们早就把话说在前面了，我们说了话是算数的。如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，那我们就毫不留情地砸断美国侵略者的脊骨，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它们消灭掉。”
      （本报通讯员、记者，解放军报特约记者， 新华社记者）

    伟大的党、伟大的毛主席和我们在一起。我们一定要同敌人血战到底！
    头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！在货船被美国强盗飞机轰炸快要沉没时，报务员黄伟超拿着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，从报务房冲出来。
