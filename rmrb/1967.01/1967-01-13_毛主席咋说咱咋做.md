    Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do,
    Our hearts are red, our eyes are bright, our minds are broad;
    We look at the world with far-reaching vision,
    And march forward singing songs of battle!

    Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do,
    The word "fight" is deeply engraved in our hearts;
    The enemy's nature will not change,
    We firmly grasp the gun in our hands!

    We fear neither death nor hardship,
    Our youthful spirit burns like fire in battle;
    We are not afraid of gunfire and bullets,
    No great difficulty can stop us!

    Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do,
    Our battle songs resound, shaking the mountains and rivers:
    We will bloom red flowers for the people,
    We will bear rich fruits for the people!

    毛主席咋说咱咋做
    姜守浩
    毛主席咋说咱咋做，心红眼亮胸怀阔；放眼世界看得远，大步前进唱战歌！毛主席咋说咱咋做，“打”字牢牢记心窝；敌人本性不会变，手中枪杆紧紧握！不怕死，不怕苦，战斗青春红似火；枪林弹雨何所惧，天大困难奈我何！毛主席咋说咱咋做，战歌激昂震山河：要为人民开红花，要为人民结硕果！
