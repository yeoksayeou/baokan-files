One day, while a reporter was visiting the office of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Dar es Salaam, he saw a young freedom fighter engrossed in writing at his desk. On the desk lay a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The young man, named Solomon Komo, told the reporter that he was writing a letter to his comrades, discussing the issue of liberating their homeland. In the letter, he seriously cited Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance and hard struggle.

Solomon Komo could recite many of Chairman Mao's quotations from memory. He particularly emphasized Chairman Mao's teaching: "The oppressed peoples and nations must not pin their hopes on the 'goodwill' of imperialism and its lackeys, but must unite and struggle to achieve victory through their own efforts." He continued, "Therefore, we should not harbor any illusions about the United Nations or any other tool of imperialism, but should rely on our own efforts and persist in struggle."

    阿扎尼亚自由战士牢记毛主席的教导
    决心坚持斗争去争取胜利
    有一天，记者访问阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻达累斯萨拉姆的办事处时，看见一位青年自由战士正在伏案疾书，桌上放着一本《毛主席语录》。这位名叫索洛蒙·科马的青年对记者说，他正在写信给他的战友，讨论他们祖国争取解放的问题。他在信里认真地引用了毛主席关于自力更生，艰苦奋斗的教导。
    索洛蒙·科马对于许多条毛主席语录，能够熟背如流。他特别重视毛主席这一教导：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”他接着说：“因此，我们不应该对联合国或其他帝国主义的任何工具抱有幻想，而应该依靠自己的努力，坚持斗争。”
