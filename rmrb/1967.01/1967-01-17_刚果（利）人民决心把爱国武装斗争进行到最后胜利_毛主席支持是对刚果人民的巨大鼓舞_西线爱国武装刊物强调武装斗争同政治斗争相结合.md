Chairman Mao said: "The just struggle of the Congolese people is not isolated. The entire Chinese people support you. All the people of the world who oppose imperialism support you. ... Strengthen national unity, persist in long-term struggle, the Congolese people will surely win, U.S. imperialism will surely fail."

The Congolese (Leopoldville) people are resolved to carry out the armed struggle to the final victory.

Chairman Mao's support is a great encouragement to the Congolese people.

The Western Front patriotic armed forces' publication emphasizes the combination of armed struggle and political struggle.

According to a report from Cairo by Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, two Congolese (Leopoldville) patriotic friends said on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the assassination of Congolese (Leopoldville) national hero Lumumba, "No matter what tricks the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists play to support the puppet regime of Mobutu, the Congolese (Leopoldville) people are determined to fight to the end until they achieve true independence and liberation."

These two Congolese (Leopoldville) friends emphasized that the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, firmly supported the Congolese (Leopoldville) people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its puppets in his statement "Support the Congolese (Leopoldville) People in Opposing U.S. Aggression." This has always been a great encouragement to the Congolese (Leopoldville) people.

One of the young people pointed out: "Mobutu is the murderer of Lumumba, and Tshombe and Kasavubu are actually of the same ilk. The one who advises him and plays new tricks is his American master, to deceive the people at home and abroad. 'We, revolutionaries from Congo, declare that Mobutu will not escape the punishment of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people for his crimes.' Another student said: 'Tshombe, Kasavubu, and Mobutu are all lackeys, either of the Americans or the Belgians. They may be lackeys of the Belgians today, but they may become lackeys of the Americans tomorrow. They are all enemies of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people. The Congolese (Leopoldville) people can only achieve their liberation by overthrowing imperialism and its lackeys in Congo (Leopoldville).'"

After these two Congolese (Leopoldville) patriotic friends made the above statements to the reporter, they opened the red-covered "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and loudly read the quotations from Chairman Mao's statement "Support the Congolese (Leopoldville) People in Opposing U.S. Aggression."

They finally said: "The great Chairman Mao and the Chinese people support us. We remain vigilant, we persist in armed struggle. The Congolese (Leopoldville) people will prove to the world that whether it is U.S. imperialism, the accomplice of U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, or the lackey of U.S. imperialism, Mobutu, they are all paper tigers. They cannot stop the Congolese (Leopoldville) people from marching forward."

According to a report from Brussels by Xinhua News Agency on the 16th, the Belgian Communist Party's organ, the weekly "Voice of the People," reported that the latest issue of "Guerrilla Fighter," a publication of the Congolese (Leopoldville) Western Front patriotic armed forces, pointed out that the Congolese (Leopoldville) patriotic armed forces can only consolidate and develop the armed struggle by fighting on two fronts: armed struggle and political struggle.

The publication said that one of its main tasks is "to conduct ideological and political education for the soldiers, mobilize and organize the masses, and carry out political struggle." It emphasized the need to mobilize and organize the entire people to establish a broad united front to accelerate the collapse of the Congolese (Leopoldville) puppet regime and the early arrival of revolutionary victory.

The publication demanded that the Congolese (Leopoldville) patriotic forces, in their struggle to achieve the above-mentioned united front, should heighten their vigilance and resolutely oppose the unprincipled unity that does not distinguish between friends and enemies and between true revolution and false revolution.

The publication called on the Congolese (Leopoldville) peasants, workers, revolutionary intellectuals, and other broad masses who are loyal to the Congolese (Leopoldville) national liberation to unite as one and wage a resolute and tenacious struggle against their enemies—imperialism and its Congolese (Leopoldville) lackeys.

The weekly "Voice of the People" also reported that the publication "Revolution" by the Congolese (Leopoldville) Eastern Front patriotic armed forces said that the military situation of the Congolese (Leopoldville) patriotic armed forces is good throughout the entire war zone. The countryside, mountains, and forests have become the base and a great revolutionary fortress for the armed forces. The broad masses of the people are being widely mobilized.

The publication pointed out that although the road of the Congolese (Leopoldville) people's revolution is tortuous and rugged, the future of the revolution is bright, and final victory will surely belong to the Congolese (Leopoldville) people.

    毛主席说：“刚果人民的正义斗争不是孤立的。全中国人民支持你们。全世界一切反对帝国主义的人民支持你们。……加强民族团结，坚持长期斗争，刚果人民必胜，美帝国主义必败。”
    刚果（利）人民决心把爱国武装斗争进行到最后胜利
    毛主席支持是对刚果人民的巨大鼓舞
    西线爱国武装刊物强调武装斗争同政治斗争相结合
    据新华社开罗十五日电　两位刚果（利）爱国朋友在刚果（利）民族英雄卢蒙巴被害六周年前夕，在这里对新华社记者说，不管美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义玩弄什么花招来支持蒙博托傀儡政权，刚果（利）人民决心斗争到底，直到取得真正的独立和解放为止。
    这两位刚果（利）朋友强调指出，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》，坚决地支持了刚果（利）人民反对美帝国主义及其傀儡的斗争，这始终是对刚果（利）人民的巨大鼓舞。
    其中的一位青年指出：“蒙博托是杀害卢蒙巴的凶手，同冲伯和卡萨武布实际上都是一路货。替他出主意玩弄新花招的是他的美国主子，为的是欺骗国内外人民。”“我们来自刚果的革命者宣告，蒙博托决逃脱不了刚果（利）人民对他所犯罪行的惩罚”。另外一位学生说：“冲伯、卡萨武布和蒙博托全是走狗，不是美国的就是比利时的走狗。他们今天也许是比利时的走狗，但是明天可能成为美国的走狗。他们都是刚果（利）人民的敌人。刚果（利）人民只有把帝国主义及其在刚果（利）的走狗打倒，才能取得自己的解放。”
    这两位刚果（利）爱国朋友在对记者发表上述谈话后，就打开红皮的《毛主席语录》，高声朗读毛主席的《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》中的语录。
    他们最后说：“伟大的毛主席和中国人民支持我们。我们保持警惕，我们坚持武装斗争。我们刚果（利）人民将向世界证明，不管美帝国主义也好，美帝国主义的帮凶苏联现代修正主义也好，或是美帝国主义的走狗蒙博托也好，它们统统都是纸老虎。它们阻挡不了刚果（利）人民向前迈进。”
    据新华社十六日讯布鲁塞尔消息：据比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊报道：刚果（利）西线爱国武装最近出版的新刊物《游击战士》指出，刚果（利）爱国武装力量只有进行武装斗争和政治斗争两条战线的斗争，才能巩固和发展武装斗争。
    这家刊物说，它的主要任务之一是“对战士进行思想和政治教育，动员和组织群众和进行政治斗争”。它强调把全国人民动员和组织起来，建立广泛的统一战线，以便加速使刚果（利）傀儡政权的垮台和革命胜利的早日到来。
    这家刊物要求刚果（利）爱国力量在争取实现上述统一战线的斗争中，提高警惕，坚决反对不区分朋友和敌人、不区分真革命和假革命的无原则的联合。
    这家刊物号召刚果（利）农民、工人、革命知识分子和其他忠于刚果民族的真正解放的广大群众，像一个人一样地团结起来，同他们的敌人——帝国主义及其刚果（利）走狗进行坚决而顽强的斗争。
    又据比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊报道：刚果（利）东线爱国武装力量出版的《革命》刊物说，刚果（利）爱国武装力量在整个战区的军事形势很好。农村、山区和森林成了武装力量的根据地和巨大的革命堡垒。广大人民群众正在广泛地动员起来。
    这家刊物指出，刚果人民革命的道路虽然是曲折的、崎岖的，但是革命的前途是光明的，最后胜利一定属于刚果人民。
