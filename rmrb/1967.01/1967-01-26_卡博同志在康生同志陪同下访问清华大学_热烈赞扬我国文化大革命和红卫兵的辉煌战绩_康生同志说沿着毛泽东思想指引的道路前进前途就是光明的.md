Comrade Kaba, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, and Comrade Behar Shytura, a member of the Central Committee, accompanied by Comrade Kang Sheng, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, visited Tsinghua University this afternoon. Comrade Vasili Nataneli, the Albanian Ambassador to China, also joined them.

Today, the Red Guards and revolutionary students of Tsinghua University awaited the arrival of their Albanian comrades from the frontline of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle with great excitement. When Comrade Kaba, Comrade Shytura, and others arrived, they were greeted by thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary students lining the streets. The crowd waved colorful flags and copies of the brilliant "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania!" The entire Tsinghua campus was filled with the warm atmosphere of fraternal friendship and fighting unity between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania.

Chao Dafu, a representative of the "Jinggangshan" Red Guards of Tsinghua University, spoke on behalf of the Red Guards and revolutionary students, warmly welcoming Comrades Kaba and Shytura to visit Tsinghua University. Chao Dafu said that the Red Guards of the Chinese revolution must always remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and contribute all their efforts to promoting the friendship between the peoples of China and Albania.

Comrade Kaba and Comrade Shytura had a cordial conversation with representatives of the Tsinghua Red Guards and revolutionary students. In his speech, Comrade Kaba enthusiastically praised our great leader Chairman Mao, highly evaluated the great Mao Zedong Thought, and enthusiastically praised the glorious achievements of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards. Comrade Kaba also spoke to the revolutionary student representatives about the cultural revolution currently underway in Albania and the contributions made by Albanian youth in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Comrade Kang Sheng, in his speech, expressed gratitude for Comrade Kaba's warm and friendly remarks. Comrade Kang Sheng said, "Comrade Hysni Kapo is our old comrade in the struggle against Khrushchev revisionism. At the Bucharest meeting, only the two parties of China and Albania openly fought against Khrushchev revisionism. At that time, we were in the minority, and revisionism was in the majority. Now, Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations have spread to more than fifty countries and regions. This proves a truth: as long as we advance along the path indicated by Mao Zedong Thought, the future is great and bright." Comrade Kang Sheng also said, "The friendship between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania has been tempered through long-term struggle and jointly created by our great leader Chairman Mao and the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. It is a friendship that has been tested and is unbreakable."

The representatives of the Tsinghua Red Guards presented "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Mao badges to their Albanian comrades. When the Red Guard representatives pinned the "Jinggangshan" Red Guard armbands on Comrades Kaba and Shytura, the entire audience erupted in enthusiastic applause.

Comrade Kaba and others also visited the exhibition of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Tsinghua University. Wherever Comrade Kaba and others went, they were greeted with enthusiastic applause and cheers.

　　卡博同志在康生同志陪同下访问清华大学
　　热烈赞扬我国文化大革命和红卫兵的辉煌战绩
　　康生同志说沿着毛泽东思想指引的道路前进前途就是光明的
    新华社二十五日讯　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、书记处书记希斯尼·卡博同志，中央委员贝哈尔·什图拉同志，由中共中央政治局常委、书记处书记康生同志陪同，今天下午访问了清华大学。阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利同志也一道前往。
    今天，清华大学的红卫兵和革命师生，怀着激动的心情，等候来自反帝反修斗争前线的阿尔巴尼亚战友们的到来。当卡博同志、什图拉同志等到达时，受到数千名红卫兵和革命师生的夹道欢迎。人们手持彩旗，挥舞着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，热情高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“中阿两党和两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”整个清华园充满着中阿两党、两国人民兄弟友谊和战斗团结的热烈气氛。
    清华大学“井冈山”红卫兵负责人蒯大富代表清华大学的红卫兵和革命师生讲话，热烈欢迎卡博、什图拉等同志来清华大学参观访问。蒯大富说，中国革命的红卫兵，一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，为增进中阿两国人民的友谊贡献自己的一切力量。
    卡博同志和什图拉同志和清华红卫兵、革命师生的代表进行了亲切的谈话。卡博同志在讲话中，热烈赞扬我们伟大的领袖毛主席，高度评价伟大的毛泽东思想，热烈赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵的战绩。卡博同志还向革命师生代表谈到了阿尔巴尼亚正在进行的文化革命，谈到了阿尔巴尼亚青年在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所作出的贡献。
    康生同志在讲话中，对卡博同志热情友好的讲话表示感谢。康生同志说，希斯尼·卡博同志是我们反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的老战友。在布加勒斯特会议的时候，公开同赫鲁晓夫修正主义作斗争的只有中阿两党。那时我们是少数，修正主义是多数。现在，马列主义政党和组织已经遍及五十多个国家和地区。这说明一个真理，只要沿着毛泽东思想指引的道路前进，前途是伟大的，光明的。康生同志还说，中阿两党两国人民的友谊，是在长期斗争中锤炼出来的，是由我们伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志共同缔造的，是久经考验的，牢不可破的。
    清华大学红卫兵代表把《毛泽东选集》、《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章送给阿尔巴尼亚战友。当红卫兵代表把“井冈山”红卫兵袖章给卡博同志、什图拉同志戴上时，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
    卡博同志等还参观了清华大学的文化大革命图片展览。卡博同志等走到哪里，哪里就响起一片热烈的掌声和欢呼声。
