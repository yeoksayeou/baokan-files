Under the "peace talks" smokescreen, the U.S. imperialists are accelerating the expansion of the Vietnam War and speeding up the deployment of cannon fodder to South Vietnam.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, the U.S. imperialists have recently, under the cover of "peace," been rapidly increasing the deployment of U.S. invasion forces to South Vietnam in preparation for new military adventures.

According to reports from Western news agencies, from December 3 of last year to January 7 of this year, the United States, in just over a month, deployed more than 30,000 cannon fodder to the battlefield in South Vietnam. Among these, in the two weeks up to January 7, 19,000 U.S. invasion forces were deployed, which is more than the average number of U.S. troops deployed each month in 1966. Due to the U.S. imperialists' accelerated deployment of troops, by January 7, the total number of U.S. invasion forces in South Vietnam had reached 395,000.

    据新华社十五日讯　西贡消息：美帝国主义最近在“和平”烟幕下又在加速向越南南方增派美国侵略军，以便进行新的军事冒险。
    据西方通讯社报道，从去年十二月三日到今年一月七日，美国在短短一个多月中就向南越战场上增派了三万多名炮灰。其中在截至一月七日的两周中增派的美国侵略军就达一万九千名，这比一九六六年平均每月增派的美军还多。由于美帝国主义加速增兵，到一月七日为止，在南越的美国侵略军的总数，已增加到三十九万五千。
