Following the workers and students of Shanghai who have risen up to rebel, the revolutionary peasant movement in Shanghai has also begun. The broad revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants have actively thrown themselves into the fierce struggle between the two lines. They are vigorously opposing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the handful of stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. This is a tremendous event. It is another important sign that the Cultural Revolution in the Shanghai area has entered a new stage. Every revolutionary comrade should rejoice over it, rejoice greatly!

The joint statement issued by the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Peasants Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, "Firmly Support the Revolutionary Peasant Movement, Thoroughly Smash the Counter-Revolutionary Economism! - A Declaration to the People of the Entire Shanghai City," is another extremely important document following the "Declaration to the People of the Entire Shanghai City" and the "Emergency Announcement." This document is a powerful blow to the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. We firmly support the four points raised in this document and hope that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants will implement and realize these points.

The peasant movement has always been an extremely important component of the revolutionary struggle. Forty years ago, during the democratic revolution period, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao highly praised the rise of the peasant movement: "The main targets of the peasants' attacks are the local tyrants, evil gentry, and lawless landlords, as well as various feudal ideas and institutions, corrupt officials in the cities, and bad customs in the countryside. This attack is like a storm, sweeping away everything in its path. Those who follow it survive, those who resist it perish. The result is that the privileges of the feudal landlords, which have lasted for thousands of years, are swept away. The dignity and prestige of the landlords are completely destroyed." The revolutionary peasant movement played an indelible historical role in the democratic revolution. In the socialist revolution period, the peasant movement is also an important component of the socialist revolution. Today, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the several million poor and lower-middle peasants in the Shanghai area have risen up to rebel. They are closely united with the workers and students. It can be said with certainty that a new situation will emerge in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs. The bourgeois reactionary line will be thoroughly smashed, and all the big and small power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in the countryside will be swept away. Their dignity and prestige will be completely destroyed. The private ownership concepts and habits that have persisted for thousands of years will be subjected to the most violent impact in this great purge. A new generation of peasants with high socialist consciousness will be tempered and grown in this great struggle of overthrowing the old and establishing the new. When people's ideological appearance changes, the production appearance of the countryside will definitely take a new leap. What is there to doubt about? There is nothing!

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants are the most reliable allies of the workers. Currently, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the Shanghai area have risen up to rebel, directly strengthening and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and thus strengthening and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. A handful of people within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, who have played tricks with economism in the cities, have been thoroughly exposed and severely struck down by the broad workers' revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses. They are not willing to accept defeat. They have come up with another scheme after one fails. They have blown the black wind of economism into the countryside, inciting a large number of peasants to leave their production posts and rush into the cities, proposing unreasonable economic welfare demands, further expanding the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and striving to create conflicts between workers and peasants, and to sabotage the worker-peasant alliance. They create conflicts and expand differences in the income distribution of collective ownership enterprises in the countryside and the incomes of workers who are both workers and peasants and those who are sent down and placed outside, stirring up people to fight against each other, and deliberately sabotaging agricultural production and the Cultural Revolution.

This trick is extremely vicious. Comrades of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, do not fall for the tricks of this handful of reactionaries. They want to make us put down our work and rebel against the year-end distribution, rebel against the workers and students, so that they can wipe their hands clean and run away. If we fall for their tricks, emphasize getting a few more banknotes one-sidedly, do not leave or leave little production funds, and even distribute all the accumulated funds over the years, who will benefit from this? It is not good for the country, not good for the collective, and not good for ourselves. In the short term, individuals may gain a little advantage; in the long term, the country and the collective will suffer a big loss. Every poor and lower-middle peasant with consciousness should not rebel against the banknotes.

Some people with ulterior motives incite by saying that peasants getting more money and increasing some welfare is for "immediately abolishing the differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants." This is a lie. Abolishing the differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants is our goal. However, the conditions for completely eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants are not yet fully met, and it is not possible to "immediately abolish." The theory of "immediate abolition" is a reactionary fallacy of "left in form, right in essence." We should actively create conditions to gradually narrow and eliminate these differences, especially to strengthen Mao Zedong Thought education and raise the communist consciousness of the broad peasant masses. If we emphasize increasing welfare one-sidedly and advocate material incentives, it will weaken ideological education and corrupt the ideological consciousness of the peasant masses. The result will not only fail to gradually narrow the differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants, but will instead nurture capitalist forces in the countryside, expand the differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants, sabotage agricultural production, and sabotage the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, it must be firmly opposed.

The revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants rise up to rebel, to revolutionize, and first of all, they should direct the spearhead of the struggle against the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in the countryside and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and politically smash their arrogant attacks. Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao said: "After the peasants have organized, their first action is to politically bring down the prestige of the landlord class, especially the local tyrants and evil gentry, ... This is an extremely serious and urgent struggle. This struggle is the central struggle of the second period, the revolutionary period. Without victory in this struggle, all struggles for rent reduction, interest reduction, land demands, and other means of production, etc., are impossible to win." It was the same in the democratic revolution period, and it is the same in the socialist revolution period. Overthrow the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, overthrow the bourgeois reactionary line, and tightly grasp the destiny of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our own hands, seize the power from these reactionaries. This is the biggest political struggle at present. Without victory in the political struggle, all economic struggles are impossible to win. We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, expose the tricks of the handful of people within the Party, such as "sitting on the mountain watching the tiger fight" and "luring the tiger out of the mountain," and firmly drag out this handful of reactionaries, and fight them down, fight them to ruin, and fight them down!

Revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadre of revolutionary organs, and revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants unite! Unite, and our power will be great; unite, and we will stand tall; unite, and all plots to sabotage the worker-peasant alliance will be thoroughly foiled. Revolutionary students and revolutionary cadre of revolutionary organs should organize and plan to go to the countryside, combine with the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn from them, and together with them repel the various new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, adhere to the correct policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." In this way, we will always stand unshakable. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high over every piece of land in the people's commune!

　　欢呼革命农民运动的兴起
　　上海《文汇报》一月二十日社论
    继上海的工人、学生起来造反之后，上海的革命农民运动兴起来了。广大革命的贫下中农积极地投身到两条路线激烈的大搏斗中，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的反，大造极少数坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子的反，大造地、富、反、坏、右的反。这是一件了不起的大事。这是上海地区的文化大革命运动进入新阶段的又一个重要标志。每一个革命的同志，都应为它欢呼，欢呼好得很！
    上海工人革命造反总司令部与上海农民革命造反总司令部筹备委员会等革命造反组织联合发表的《坚决支持革命农民运动，彻底摧毁反革命经济主义！——告上海全市人民书》，是继《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》之后，又一个极其重要的文件。这个文件，是对资产阶级反动路线新反扑的再一次猛烈的打击。我们坚决支持这个文件提出的四点意见，并希望广大贫下中农都来贯彻实现这些意见。
    农民运动始终是革命斗争中极其重要的组成部分。四十年前，在民主革命时期，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席这样高度赞扬农民运动的兴起：“农民的主要攻击目标是土豪劣绅，不法地主，旁及各种宗法的思想和制度，城里的贪官污吏，乡村的恶劣习惯。这个攻击的形势，简直是急风暴雨，顺之者存，违之者灭。其结果，把几千年封建地主的特权，打得个落花流水。地主的体面威风，扫地以尽。”革命农民运动在民主革命中立下了不可磨灭的历史功勋。到了社会主义革命时期，农民运动同样是社会主义革命运动的一个重要组成部分。今天，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，上海地区的几百万贫下中农起来造反了，他们和工人、学生紧密地联合一起。可以肯定地说，上海郊区的农村将会出现崭新的局面，资产阶级反动路线将被彻底砸烂，农村里那些大大小小的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，必将被打得落花流水，他们的体面威风，必定会扫地以尽；几千年留下的私有观念、习惯势力，必将在这场大扫荡中受到最猛烈的冲击，具有高度社会主义觉悟的一代新农民，将会在这场大破大立的阶级斗争中锻炼成长。人的思想面貌变了，农村的生产面貌，必将发生一个新的飞跃。这还有什么可怀疑的吗？没有了！
    广大贫下中农是工人的最可靠的同盟军。目前上海地区广大贫下中农起来造反，直接加强、巩固了工农联盟，也就加强、巩固了无产阶级专政。上海市委内一小撮人，在城市里玩弄经济主义的新阴谋，被广大工人革命造反派和革命群众彻底揭露、迎头痛击后，并不甘心于失败。他们一计不成，又生一计，把经济主义的黑风刮向农村，煽动大批农民离开生产岗位，涌向城市，提出不合理的经济福利要求，进一步扩大工农差别、城乡差别，竭力制造工农之间的矛盾，破坏工农联盟；他们在农村集体所有制企业和亦工亦农社员及外出下放工人的收入分配上，制造矛盾，扩大差别，挑动群众斗群众，蓄意破坏农业生产，破坏文化大革命。
    这一招是极其毒辣的。广大的贫下中农同志们，决不要上这一小撮反动家伙的当。他们妄想叫我们放下手里的活不干，去造年终分配的反，去造工人、学生的反，他们自己便可以拍拍屁股跑掉了。我们如果上了他们的当，片面强调多分几张钞票，不留或少留生产资金，甚至把历年积累下来的资金都分光了，这样干对谁有好处呢？对国家没有好处，对集体没有好处，对自己也没有好处。从眼前看，个人占点小便宜；从长远看，国家、集体就要吃大亏。每一个有觉悟的贫下中农，都不应该去造钞票的反。
    有些别有用心的人煽动说，农民多拿些钱，增加一点福利，是为了“立即取消城乡差别和工农差别”。这是骗人的鬼话。取消城乡差别和工农差别，是我们的奋斗目标。但是，目前还没有完全具备消灭城乡差别和工农差别的条件，不可能做到“立即取消”。“立即取消”论是“形左实右”的反动谬论。我们应当为逐步缩小、消灭这些差别积极创造条件，特别要加强毛泽东思想教育，提高广大农民群众的共产主义觉悟。如果片面强调增加福利，鼓吹物质刺激，那就削弱了思想教育，腐蚀了农民群众的思想意识，其结果，不仅不能逐步缩小城乡差别、工农差别，相反，只能滋长农村中的资本主义势力，扩大城乡差别和工农差别，破坏农业生产，破坏工农联盟，因此必须坚决反对。　
    革命的贫下中农起来造反，起来革命，首先应把斗争的矛头指向农村中党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，从政治上彻底打垮他们的猖狂进攻。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席说：“农民有了组织之后，第一个行动，便是从政治上把地主阶级特别是土豪劣绅的威风打下去，……这是一个极严重极紧要的斗争。这个斗争是第二时期即革命时期的中心斗争。这个斗争不胜利，一切减租减息，要求土地及其他生产手段等等的经济斗争，决无胜利之可能。”民主革命时期如此，社会主义革命时期同样如此。打倒党内走资本主义道路的当权派，打倒资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级专政的命运紧紧掌握在自己手里，把权从这帮反动的家伙手里夺过来，这是当前最大的政治斗争。政治斗争不胜利，一切经济斗争都无胜利之可能。我们应当按照毛主席的教导，拆穿党内一小撮人“坐山观虎斗”、“调虎离山”等鬼计，狠狠地把这一小撮反动家伙揪出来，把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒！
    革命的工人、革命的学生、革命的机关干部和革命的贫下中农联合起来！联合起来，我们的力量就大了；联合起来，就站得高了；联合起来，一切破坏工农联盟的阴谋，就彻底破产了。革命的学生、革命的机关干部应该有组织有计划地到农村去，同贫下中农相结合，向他们学习，和他们一起击退资产阶级反动路线形形色色的新反扑，坚持“抓革命，促生产”的正确方针，这样我们就能永远立于不败之地。让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在人民公社的每一块土地上，永远高高飘扬！
