	Chairman Mao is the red sun,
	The lamps are bright and shining,
	But the lamps cannot compare to the sun's brightness.
	Chairman Mao is the red sun,
	Illuminating the hearts of all ethnic peoples.

	Thousands of rivers, tens of thousands of streams,
	All rivers and streams flow into the ocean.
	Closely following Chairman Mao,
	We march towards the future of communism.

    毛主席就是红太阳
    （回族民歌）盏盏明灯亮堂堂，明灯哪有太阳亮。毛主席就是红太阳，把各族人民的心照亮。千条河，万条江，条条江河汇海洋。紧紧跟着毛主席，奔向共产主义前方。
