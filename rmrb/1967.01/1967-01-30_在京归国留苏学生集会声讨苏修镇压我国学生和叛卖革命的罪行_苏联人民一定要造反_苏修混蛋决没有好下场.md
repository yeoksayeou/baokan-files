The Soviet revisionists' bloody suppression of Chinese students in Europe has sparked immense indignation among the 700 million Chinese people. The storm of denunciation against the Soviet revisionists has swept across the nation. On January 27, a group of returned students from the Soviet Union in Beijing held a rally to strongly condemn the Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocities and to express firm support for the 69 Chinese students who bravely fought back.

The Soviet revisionists' traitorous faces are fully exposed

The attendees first exposed the Soviet revisionists' fascist, ugly faces.

Jin Xian and Lang Zhihong said: The Soviet revisionists' savage beating of Chinese students is a thorough fascist atrocity. This incident has completely exposed their ugly faces. Chinese students reading the quotations of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao, at Lenin's tomb is the best way to honor Lenin. However, the Soviet revisionists dispatched hundreds of soldiers, police, and spies to attack our Chinese students. This has stripped off their masks and nakedly revealed that they are traitors to Lenin, traitors to the October Revolution, and traitors to the Soviet people.

Han Jingqing and Zhao Yucai said: The Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocities against Chinese students have made us recall the bloody incident that occurred in Moscow two years ago. At that time, we personally participated in the anti-American demonstrations in support of Vietnam by Asian, African, and Latin American students. As soon as we started, the Soviet authorities quickly dispatched over 700 soldiers and police, treating it as a major threat, and heavily guarded the American embassy, fearing to offend even a single hair of the American imperialists. They savagely drove horses to charge at the Asian, African, and Latin American students, wielding sticks and beating them brutally, causing a horrifying massacre.

The last bloody incident occurred in front of the American embassy. This time, it happened at Lenin's tomb. These are two major exposures of the Soviet revisionists' traitorous faces and two debts of blood they owe. With new grievances added to old ones, we must make the Soviet revisionists pay their blood debts!

The Soviet revisionists fear Mao Zedong Thought the most

The attendees unanimously pointed out that the Soviet revisionists' heinous crimes fully reflect their cowardly fear of the people and the truth.

Yang Wentang, Zhang Hongbin, Zhao Zhong, and Li Zhicai said: The bloody fascist atrocity orchestrated by the Soviet revisionist leadership is a desperate move, once again exposing the extremely weak essence of revisionism. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the history of mankind, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces." The Soviet revisionists' days are numbered, and their end is near!

These Soviet revisionist scoundrels turn pale at the mention of Mao Zedong Thought, which precisely shows how much they fear the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Ultimately, they are most afraid that once the Soviet people accept Mao Zedong Thought, they will rise up to rebel against them and overthrow them.

When we were in the Soviet Union, we saw with our own eyes how the Soviet revisionist clique did everything possible to block information about China, deceive the Soviet people, and frenziedly oppose Mao Zedong Thought. They not only did not allow the propagation of Chairman Mao's works but also prevented people from reading them. When we were in the Soviet Union, we heard that a Soviet teacher, risking political persecution, went to the library to borrow Chairman Mao's works three times but failed each time. The Soviet people are very concerned about China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and construction. Last year, during the National Day celebrations, we, as usual, held a photo exhibition, but this legitimate request was met with countless obstacles from the Soviet revisionists.

The Soviet revisionists vigorously obstructed and sabotaged the Soviet people's contact with us, fearing the great influence of China. They particularly targeted Soviet people who had more contact with us, even sending thugs to follow and surveil them. Sometimes when we went out, they sent police to monitor us.

The Soviet revisionists' treacherous actions of restoring capitalism

These young people who had studied in the Soviet Union also exposed, through their personal experiences, the Soviet revisionists' various crimes of restoring capitalism domestically, colluding with American imperialism, and betraying the world revolution.

Jia Shu said: The Soviet revisionists are thoroughly restoring capitalism domestically, from politics and economics to culture, having nothing in common with a socialist country. The privileged class lives a decadent bourgeois luxurious life, indulging in eating, drinking, and pleasure. In the Soviet Union, free markets are everywhere, and lottery gambling is rampant. To solve the foreign exchange problem, they opened foreign exchange stores in major cities like Moscow for the rich to enjoy. However, the vast majority of Soviet working people still live in crowded conditions with low monthly incomes. Some ordinary workers earn only a few dozen rubles a month and have to rely on loans to make ends meet by the end of the month.

Wang Jing, Jin Xian, and Wei Liansheng said: The Soviet revisionist leadership has implemented a thorough fascist dictatorship, no less than Hitler and Mussolini. The Soviet people have no freedom; anyone who dares to oppose the Soviet revisionist leadership will be imprisoned or even exiled to Siberia. Their methods are very ruthless. A woman in her forties, during the Soviet elections, expressed her dissatisfaction with this sham election. The Soviet authorities then fabricated a doctor's note, claiming she was mentally ill, and sent her to a psychiatric hospital.

Zhang Yanan said: The Soviet people are increasingly recognizing the ugly faces of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique. A young worker said, "We Soviet people and the leaders are not on the same side. We do not acknowledge Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others as the leaders of the Soviet people; they are just a bunch of disgraceful politicians."

The Soviet people's hearts are with Chairman Mao

The attendees then excitedly shared many touching stories about how the Soviet people's hearts are with Chairman Mao and their love for Mao Zedong Thought.

Han Jingqing said: A Soviet classmate told us, "The Soviet government can expel you, but the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought is eternal and cannot be expelled." The broad Soviet working people have deep friendship with the Chinese people and are extremely fond of our great leader Chairman Mao.

Zhao Yucai said: When we went to Georgia for practice, the local people's remembrance of Chairman Mao was very touching. On the streets, no matter how severely the Soviet spies monitored, the Soviet people still enthusiastically gathered around us, holding our hands and asking for Chairman Mao's badges. A worker said, "If you love Stalin and Mao Zedong, we will treat you to a drink. If you love Khrushchev, we will give you a fist."

Zhang Hongbin and Cai Wufeng said: Whether in Moscow or elsewhere, as we walked or sat on the bus, we often heard someone whispering, "Long live Chairman Mao!" We met many people who often gave us thumbs up and said, "China, Mao Zedong, great!" The Soviet people believe that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist in the world. An old worker said, "Mao Zedong is today's Lenin!"

Li Zhicai said: The Soviet people love Chairman Mao's works and eagerly want to obtain them. They believe that China is the hope of the world revolution, and to make a revolution, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao's works cannot be openly sold in the Soviet Union, and many have been confiscated. Before we left, a Soviet friend came to visit us and asked us to leave Chairman Mao's works with him. A Soviet student said, "Now, to make a revolution, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought. I will study Chairman Mao's works well."

Zhang Hongbin said: A Soviet youth wrote a letter to Chairman Mao saying, "I believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the true Marxism-Leninism of our time. Only your thought can save my country."

Zhao Yucai said: The broad Soviet people deeply detest the Soviet revisionist leadership's traitorous behavior. We firmly believe that under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Soviet people will definitely rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionists. Just as that Soviet youth who wrote to Chairman Mao said, in the near future, the true flag of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—will rise over the Kremlin!

Finally, the attendees unanimously expressed their determination to follow our heart's red sun, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, to make a revolution, to be revolutionary rebels, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and to uproot revisionism.

　　在京归国留苏学生集会声讨苏修镇压我国学生和叛卖革命的罪行
　　苏联人民一定要造反　苏修混蛋决没有好下场
    本报讯　苏修集团血腥镇压我国留欧学生的滔天罪行，激起了七亿中国人民的无比义愤。声讨苏修的愤怒风暴，席卷全国。一月二十七日，在北京的部分归国留苏学生举行集会，强烈谴责苏修的法西斯暴行，对我国六十九名留欧学生的英勇斗争表示坚决支持。
      苏修叛徒面目的大暴露
    到会同志首先揭露了苏修叛徒的法西斯狰狞面目。
    金线、郎志红说：苏修野蛮殴打我国留学生，是彻头彻尾的法西斯暴行。这个事件，彻底暴露了他们的丑恶嘴脸。我国留学生在列宁墓前朗读当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席的语录，这是对列宁的最好的怀念。然而苏修集团竟然出动几百名军警、特务，对我国留学生大打出手。这正好揭穿了他们的假面具，赤裸裸地表明了他们是列宁的叛徒，十月革命的叛徒，苏联人民的叛徒。
    韩京清、赵月民说：苏修镇压中国留学生的法西斯暴行，使我们又回想起两年前在莫斯科发生的流血事件。当时，我们亲自参加了亚非拉留学生的援越反美示威。我们刚刚起步，苏修当局就急忙出动了七百多名军警，如临大敌，密密层层，守卫美国大使馆，唯恐触动美帝国主义的一根毫毛。他们对于举行援越反美示威的亚非拉学生竟野蛮地驱使马队横冲直闯，挥舞棍棒，滥肆毒打，造成了骇人听闻的惨案。
    上次流血事件是在美国大使馆门前发生的。这次流血事件是在列宁墓前发生的。这是苏修叛徒面目的两次大暴露，是苏修欠下的两笔血债。新仇加上旧恨，我们一定要苏修偿还血债！
      苏修最怕毛泽东思想
    与会同志一致指出，苏修犯下的滔天罪行，集中地反映了这伙叛徒害怕人民、害怕真理的丑态。
    杨文堂、张鸿斌、赵重、李志才说：苏修领导集团策动的这次血腥的法西斯暴行，是狗急跳墙，再次暴露了修正主义极其虚弱的本质。正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出的：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。苏修的日子长不了，末日就在眼前！
    这批苏修混蛋一听到毛泽东思想，脸孔就要变色，正好说明了他们对战无不胜的毛泽东思想怕得要死。归根结底，他们最害怕苏联人民接受了毛泽东思想以后，就会起来造他们的反，革他们的命。
    我们在苏联的时候，我们亲眼看到苏修集团怎样千方百计封锁中国消息，欺骗苏联人民，疯狂反华，反对毛泽东思想。他们对毛主席著作，不但不许宣传，还不让人看。我们在苏联时，听说有一位苏联教员冒着受政治迫害的危险，到图书馆去借毛主席著作，连借三次都借不到。苏联人民非常关心我国的文化大革命和建设情况。去年国庆，我们按照惯例举办图片展览，可是这一正当要求，却受到了苏修百般刁难。
    苏修竭力阻挠和破坏苏联人民同我们接触，害怕中国的伟大影响。他们特别对跟我们多接触的苏联人民进行打击，甚至派流氓跟踪盯梢。有时我们出去，他们还派警察监视。
      苏修复辟资本主义的叛卖行动
    这些曾经在苏联留学的青年，还在会上用他们的亲身经历，揭露了苏修对内实行资本主义复辟，对外勾结美帝，叛卖世界革命的种种罪行。
    贾曙说：苏修在国内大搞资本主义复辟，从政治、经济一直到文化，已经跟社会主义国家没有一丁点儿共同之处了。特权阶层过着腐化堕落的资产阶级奢华生活，吃喝玩乐，随心所欲。在苏联，自由市场到处都有，还盛行彩票的赌博。为了解决外汇困难，在莫斯科等大城市开设了外汇商店，供有钱人享受。可是，苏联广大的劳动人民，还住得很拥挤，每月的收入很低。有的普通工人，每月才收入几十个卢布，月底就要靠借债度日。
    王静、金线、魏连生说：苏修领导集团实行了彻头彻尾的法西斯专政，不亚于希特勒和墨索里尼。苏联人民是没有自由的，只要谁起来反对苏修领导，就要坐牢，甚至被流放到西伯利亚。他们的手段是很毒辣的。有一个四十多岁的妇女，在进行苏维埃选举的时候，因为对这种虚伪的选举不满，苏修当局就假造医生证明，说她神经不正常，把她送进了精神病院。
    张延安说：苏联人民日益清楚地认识了苏修领导集团这一小撮人的丑恶面目。有一个青年工人说：“我们苏联人民和领导人不是一条心，我们不承认勃列日涅夫、柯西金等人是苏联人民的领袖，他们不过是一些可耻的政客。”
        苏联人民心向毛主席
    接着，到会的同志们兴奋地谈到了苏联人民心向毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想的许多感人的事迹。
    韩京清说：一个苏联同学对我们说：“苏联政府可以把你们赶走，但是毛泽东思想的伟大真理是永远赶不走的。”苏联广大劳动人民对中国人民的友谊是深厚的，对我们的伟大领袖毛主席是非常非常热爱的。
    赵月民说：我们到格鲁吉亚实习时，当地人民对毛主席的怀念是很使人感动的。在街上，无论苏修的特务监视得多么厉害，苏联人民仍然热情地围拢我们，拉着我们的手要毛主席像章。有个工人说，“要是你爱斯大林、毛泽东，就请你喝酒，要是你爱赫鲁晓夫，就给你拳头。”
    张鸿斌、蔡武峰说：无论是在莫斯科，还是在其它地方，我们走在路上或坐在车上，常常听到有人低声在喊：“毛主席万岁！”我们碰到过许多人，他们常常竖起大拇指说“中国，毛泽东，好样的！”苏联人民认为毛主席是世界上最伟大的马列主义者。有个老工人说：“毛泽东就是今天的列宁！”
    李志才说：苏联人民非常热爱毛主席著作，渴望得到毛主席著作。他们认为中国是世界革命的希望，干革命就要靠毛泽东思想。毛主席著作在苏联不能公开出售，很多被没收了。在我们临走前，有一个苏联朋友来我们这里做客，他要求我们把毛主席著作给他留下。有一个苏联学生说，“现在干革命，靠的就是毛泽东思想。我要好好研究毛主席的著作。”
    张鸿斌说：一个苏联青年写信给毛主席说：“我认为，毛泽东思想是当代真正的马克思列宁主义。只有您的思想，才能够拯救我的祖国。”
    赵月民说：苏联广大人民对苏修领导集团的叛徒行为是深恶痛绝的。我们坚信，苏联人民在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，一定会起来造苏修的反。正像那个给毛主席写信的苏联青年说的那样，在不久的将来，在克里姆林宫的上空，将会升起真正的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的旗帜！
    最后，与会同志们一致表示，一定要跟着我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席闹革命，誓当革命造反派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把修正主义连根拔掉。
