Today, Shanghai newspapers published the reply letters from the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and other revolutionary mass organizations to the congratulatory letters from the Perat Mao Zedong Textile Joint Factory and other units in Albania on January 14, expressing gratitude for the great support and encouragement from the Albanian comrades, and extending high proletarian cultural revolution greetings to the comrades in the land of the eagles.

Letter from the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters:

Dear Albanian Comrades,

With hearts full of excitement, we, the members of the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, have received the congratulatory letter from our comrades on the distant Adriatic coast. In your letter, you warmly congratulate us on our high spirits in the proletarian cultural revolution, on holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and on defeating the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line. You have also praised our implementation of Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and our smashing of the evil plots of the counter-revolutionary revisionists.

We are deeply moved by the high praise from our class brothers in Albania, who stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. At the same time, we feel ashamed that we have not done enough and have done too little.

However, we can assure our dear comrades that in the long and arduous struggle ahead, no matter how strong the winds or how high the waves, we will always follow the great leader Chairman Mao closely, and give any new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line a decisive blow, smashing them to pieces!

We will forever stand together with the proletarians of the world, fighting to the end to completely eliminate American imperialism and modern revisionism!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between China and Albania!

Long live our beloved leaders Chairman Mao and Enver Hoxha! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

Letter from the Red Guards of Shanghai Higher Education Institutions Revolutionary Committee:

Dear Albanian Comrades,

In these days of triumphant songs and frequent victories, we, the little red guards of Chairman Mao, are delighted to read the congratulatory letter from the workers of the Perat Mao Zedong Textile Joint Factory and other units to the revolutionary rebel groups in Shanghai. Your letter is filled with internationalist passion and revolutionary rebel spirit. Your letter has given us the greatest support, encouragement, and motivation. We, the revolutionary rebels, extend high proletarian cultural revolution greetings to our distant comrades in the land of the eagles!

Under the correct leadership of the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people stand at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, braving the dark winds and evil waves, and have established immortal merits for the international communist movement. You have strongly opposed capitalism, Soviet revisionist leadership, the Tito clique in Yugoslavia, and imperialism. This opposition is correct and well-deserved! We firmly support you! We learn from you, learning your fearless revolutionary rebel spirit and your selfless internationalist spirit.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will still struggle to the last. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, attempting to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour." Although all enemies of the people have been defeated, they still dream of a comeback and restoration. Within our party, there are their agents. If we do not carry out the proletarian cultural revolution, they will attack us and sabotage us. Then, the tragedy of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union will be repeated in our country. This is absolutely unacceptable. We respond to Chairman Mao's call to "care about national affairs and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end," and we have risen up in rebellion! Our actions have provoked fierce counterattacks from domestic and foreign class enemies, and have drawn curses and slanders from imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries. The more the class enemies oppose us, the more it shows that we are correct. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao closely, to strongly oppose and thoroughly smash the special counter-revolutionary line!

We are domestic revolutionary rebels and also international revolutionary rebels, a glorious soldier of the international communist movement. We deeply understand that the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat is interconnected; the influence of our proletarian cultural revolution is spreading around the world, inspiring the oppressed and exploited people of various countries. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

"Even if we are separated by the sea, we are as close as neighbors." The people of China and Albania will forever be heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder. No matter how treacherous the rapids or how fierce the storms, we will forever be faithful to the unbreakable friendship between China and Albania, fighting together with you, advancing the international communist movement together, and ultimately burying capitalism, imperialism, and modern revisionism on this earth!

Long live the unity of all revolutionary rebels around the world!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and Albania!

Long live the proletarian cultural revolution!

Long live the great Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha!

Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts!

Letter from the Shanghai Port Bureau Fifth District Workers Revolutionary Rebel Team:

Dear Albanian Comrades,

Today, as we open the newspaper and see your four letters full of revolutionary passion, our blood boils with excitement. We shout a thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Your letters have added endless luster to the brilliant history of Sino-Albanian friendship. We sincerely thank you for your enthusiastic encouragement and firm support for the Shanghai revolutionary rebels.

Currently, we are engaged in a fierce struggle to seize power from a small clique within the party who are taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary rebels and the revolutionary masses are breaking through layer upon layer of obstacles, firmly seizing the power of politics, economy, and culture into our own hands.

After the publication of the "Open Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the "Emergency Announcement," the revolutionary rebels and the revolutionary masses in our entire district are even more enthusiastic, striving for new victories in revolution and production. On January 10, the revolutionary rebels of the Fifth District took over the production leadership of the entire district, establishing a new production leadership body—the Shanghai Port Fifth District Revolutionary Production Committee. On January 12, the revolutionary rebels and the revolutionary masses, who have been fighting continuously, completed the production task of 2,000 tons with overfulfillment, reporting to the new production leadership body. In the midst of the stormy struggle, the revolutionary leftist forces are continuously growing. Many people who were deceived have also risen up in revolution and rebellion!

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength, and not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." Although the bourgeois reactionary line is on the verge of collapse and has declared bankruptcy, the enemy will not perish on its own, just as your proverb says, "The leopard can change its spots, but not its nature." The small clique within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line will never willingly accept their own demise. They attempt to use the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic trash to oppose our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. But we revolutionary rebels firmly believe that the revolutionary ship will forever advance to victory along the path indicated by Chairman Mao! Look to the future, it will surely be a red communist world.

Dear comrades, the friendship between China and Albania is like the flowing waters of the Adriatic Sea and the East China Sea, eternal and evergreen. Last year, when the port delegation from your country visited our Shanghai Port, there was so much passion to express, and countless words boiled down to one sentence: we sincerely wish our great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! We wish Comrade Enver Hoxha eternal life!

Dear comrades, the working class of Shanghai, the dock workers of the port, will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," firmly guard our production posts, and thoroughly defeat the counter-revolutionary revisionist economic trend. The struggle is full of twists and turns, but with the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven nor earth, neither gods nor ghosts. We dare to climb the mountain of knives and dare to rush into the sea of fire. With your most selfless and firm support, we are confident that the struggle will ultimately achieve victory! Although Shanghai and Tirana are separated by thousands of miles, our hearts are forever connected!

Let us unite, fight together, and win together!

    革命航船必将永远沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进
    上海革命造反组织复信感谢阿尔巴尼亚兄弟的巨大支持和鼓舞
    新华社上海十八日电　今天上海报纸发表了上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命群众组织给阿尔巴尼亚培拉特毛泽东纺织联合工厂等单位十四日的贺信的复信，感谢阿尔巴尼亚兄弟的巨大支持和鼓舞，并向山鹰之国的战友们致以崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部的复信亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚战友们：
    我们上海工人革命造反总司令部全体成员以无比激动的心情，收到了来自远隔万里的亚得里亚海岸的战友的贺信。你们在贺信中，热烈祝贺我们在无产阶级文化大革命中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，又一次击溃了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑；贯彻了毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的号召；粉碎了反革命修正主义分子的罪恶阴谋。
    对于站在反帝反修斗争最前线的阿尔巴尼亚的阶级兄弟给予我们如此崇高的评价，我们受到很大的鼓舞，同时又感到惭愧，我们做得还不够，我们做得还太少。
    但是，我们可以向我们亲爱的同志保证：在今后长期的、艰苦的斗争中，不管风多急，浪多高，我们一定永远紧紧跟着伟大领袖毛主席，随时随地给以任何形式出现的资产阶级反动路线的新反扑以迎头痛击，坚决砸烂它们，粉碎它们！
    我们要永远和全世界无产者紧紧的团结在一起，为彻底消灭美帝国主义和现代修正主义而战斗到底！
    中阿两国的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    我们敬爱的领袖毛主席和恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！万岁！万万岁！
                  上海工人革命造反总司令部
                          一九六七年一月十七日
    红卫兵上海市大专院校革命委员会的复信亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚战友们：
    我们，毛主席的红小兵，在凯歌高奏、捷报频传的日子里，高兴地阅读了培拉特毛泽东纺织联合工厂等单位的职工给上海革命造反团体的贺信。你们的贺信，洋溢着国际主义的激情，充满着革命造反的斗志。你们的贺信，给了我们最大的支持、鼓舞和鞭策。我们革命造反者向遥远的山鹰之国的战友们致以崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼！
    在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民站在反帝反修的最前线，顶黑风，战恶浪，为国际共产主义运动建立了不朽的功勋。你们大造资本主义的反，大造苏联修正主义领导集团、南斯拉夫铁托集团的反，大造帝国主义的反，这个反造得好，造得对！我们坚决地支持你们！我们向你们学习，学习你们天不怕、地不怕的革命造反精神，学习你们忘我牺牲的国际主义精神。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”一切人民的敌人虽然被打倒，但他们总是妄想变天，妄想复辟。在我们党内就有他们的代理人。如果我们不搞无产阶级文化大革命，他们就要搞我们，进攻我们，那么，苏联资本主义复辟的恶剧就会在我国重演。这是我们绝对不容许的。我们响应毛主席的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，起来造反了！我们的行动，引起国内外阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，引来帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的谩骂和污蔑。阶级敌人如此反对我们，正说明我们做对了。我们决心紧跟毛主席，大反特反，一反到底！
    我们是国内革命造反派，也是国际革命造反派，是国际共产主义运动的一名光荣战士。我们深深懂得：国际无产阶级的革命事业，总是相通的；我们的无产阶级文化大革命的影响，正在波及全世界，激励各国被压迫被剥削的人民。我们一定遵循毛主席的教导，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    “海内存知己，天涯若比邻。”中阿两国人民永远心连心，肩并肩。任凭险滩恶浪，狂风暴雨，我们将永远忠实于中阿两国牢不可破的友谊，和你们团结战斗，共同推进国际共产主义运动，在地球上最终埋葬资本主义、帝国主义和现代修正主义！
    全世界革命造反者联合起来！
    中阿两国人民的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！

                          一九六七年一月十七日
    上海港务局五区工人革命造反队的复信亲爱的阿尔巴尼亚战友们：
    今天，当我们翻开报纸，见到你们四封充满革命激情的贺信，浑身热血沸腾。我们千遍万遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”你们的信，给中阿友谊的灿烂史上增添了无穷的光辉。衷心感谢你们对我们上海革命造反派的热情的鼓舞，坚决的支持。
    目前，我们正在和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行激烈的夺权斗争。革命造反派和革命群众正在冲破层层障碍，把政治、经济、文化的大权，牢牢地掌握在自己的手里。
    《告上海全市人民书》及《紧急通告》发布后，我们全区的革命造反派及革命群众，愈加斗志昂扬，努力夺取革命、生产的新胜利。一月十日，我们五区革命造反派接管全区的生产领导权，成立了新的生产领导机构——上港五区革命生产委员会。一月十二日，连续奋战的革命造反派和革命群众，以超额完成二千吨的生产任务，向新的生产领导机构报捷。在斗争的大风浪里，革命左派队伍正在不断壮大。许多受蒙蔽的人也起来革命了，起来造反了！
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。虽然资产阶级反动路线日暮途穷，宣告破产。但是敌人是不会自行消灭的，正像你们俗语所说的那样，“狈皮可换，本性难改”。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子是决不甘心自己灭亡的，他们妄图利用反革命修正主义的经济主义破烂货来对抗我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。但我们革命造反派深信，革命的航船必将永远沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进！试看未来必将是一个红彤彤的共产主义世界。
    亲爱的战友们，中阿友谊就像亚得里亚海和东海的流水一样永恒不断，万古长青。去年，当你们国家的港口代表团来我们上海港友好访问的时候，多少激情要表达，千言万语归一句，我们都衷心地祝愿我们伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆！祝愿恩维尔·霍查同志万寿无疆！
    亲爱的战友们，我们上海的工人阶级，海港的码头工人，将最坚决地实行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，坚守生产岗位，彻底打垮反革命修正主义的经济主义思潮。斗争是有反复的，道路是曲折的，但是有了光辉的毛泽东思想，我们天不怕，地不怕，神不怕，鬼不怕。刀山敢上，火海敢闯。有了你们最无私最坚决的支持，我们深信，斗争必将会取得最后胜利！上海—地拉那虽然遥隔万里，但是我们的心永远相连！
    让我们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
              上海港务局五区工人革命造反队
                          一九六七年一月十七日
