	Revolutionary rebels, we resolutely support you
	The soldiers guarding Tiananmen Square enthusiastically cheer the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses

	“Long live Chairman Mao!” “Long live the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao!” These are the enthusiastic shouts of the People's Liberation Army guards at Tiananmen Square. In recent days, the great revolutionary storm of the proletarian revolutionary rebels' united front and power seizure struggle has greatly inspired these soldiers. At a recent meeting, they unanimously expressed their resolve to Chairman Mao, saying: We will definitely enthusiastically respond to your great call, resolutely support and aid the proletarian revolutionary rebels. We will defend Chairman Mao to the death, defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	With power, we have everything
	At the meeting, the soldiers said: Revolutionary masses must take control of their own destiny. In the end, there is only one thing to do: seize the power and firmly grasp it in our own hands. Platoon leader Peng Ziming, who grew up in hardship, is particularly concerned about this matter of power. He said: “In the old society, the power was in the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In 1942, three members of my family starved to death. They were killed by the reactionary landlords. With power in their hands, how could there be a way out for the poor! Now that we have just started to live a good life, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road want to push us poor and lower-middle peasants back into the fire pit. We will not agree to this, not even a thousand times, not even ten thousand times! We must resolutely seize the power from their hands!”

	Fully support the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses
	At the meeting, everyone enthusiastically cheered the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary masses across the country, expressing their determination to stand firmly with the revolutionary masses and not adopt a non-interventionist attitude or engage in compromise. Soldier Jiang Peide said: “Chairman Mao teaches us: ‘Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization.’ Currently, hundreds of millions of revolutionary people are carrying out a comprehensive power seizure struggle across the country. This is a great innovation of the proletarian revolution. We, the People's Liberation Army, must resolutely and unambiguously support the proletarian revolutionary masses, and severely strike down the rightists.” Soldier Wu Chufu said: “The army is not living in a vacuum and must have a firm stance and clear banner. We absolutely cannot adopt a non-interventionist attitude or muddle through. Supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses is to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Muddling through and adopting a non-interventionist attitude objectively helps the enemy, which is absolutely not allowed.”

	The People's Liberation Army will achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution
	The People's Liberation Army, created by Chairman Mao, must achieve new victories in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the discussion, some comrades mentioned that many Red Guards in front of Tiananmen Square told them: “Comrades of the PLA, because you hold the gun tightly, we have great democracy.” These warm words deeply moved the soldiers. Soldier Xiang Baojin said: “Revolutionary predecessors have made contributions to establishing the power, and we will carry forward the glorious tradition and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution. In the life-and-death struggle of the power seizure in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will be highly vigilant and firmly guard our posts, ready at any time to smash any plots of the domestic and foreign enemies. In the fierce class struggle, we will ‘make up our minds, not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.’ For defending Chairman Mao, defending Mao Zedong Thought, defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and defending the dictatorship of the proletariat, we will contribute everything, even our lives.” How can we achieve a firm stance and clear banner in the Cultural Revolution? During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the most fundamental thing is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, raise class consciousness, and strengthen the concept of class struggle. Comrades said: Mao Zedong Thought is a microscope and a telescope, the most powerful weapon. With it, we can see through phenomena to the essence, and no matter what tricks the enemy plays, we can expose and defeat them.

　　革命造反派，我们坚决支持你
　　守卫天安门的战士热烈欢呼无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争
      “毛主席万岁！”“以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”这是守卫天安门的人民解放军警卫战士共同迸发出来的激动欢呼。连日来，无产阶级革命造反派大联合展开夺权斗争的伟大革命风暴，使这些战士受到巨大的鼓舞。他们在最近举行的一次座谈会上，一致向伟大领袖毛主席表示决心说：我们一定最热烈地响应您的伟大号召，坚决支持和援助无产阶级革命造反派。我们要誓死保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级专政，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
        有了政权，就有了一切
    在座谈会上，指战员们说：革命群众要掌握自己的命运，千条万条归根到底一句话，就是要掌握印把子，把政权紧紧掌握在自己手里。班长彭子明是在苦水里生、甜水里长大的，对印把子这件大事特别关心。他说：“在旧社会，政权在国民党反动派手里，一九四二年我家就饿死三口人。那是被地主反动派治死的。政权在他们手里，哪有穷人的活路！现在，刚过上好日子，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，又要把我们贫下中农往火坑里推，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！我们要坚决把他们手里的权夺回来！”
    全力支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争
    座谈会上，大家热烈欢呼无产阶级革命派在全国范围内展开的夺权斗争，表示要坚决地和革命派站在一起，不能采取不介入的态度，不能搞折中主义。战士姜培德说：“毛主席教导我们：‘阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。’当前，亿万革命人民在全国范围内展开全面的夺权斗争，这是无产阶级革命的伟大创举。我们人民解放军就是要坚决地毫不含糊地支持无产阶级革命派，狠狠地打击右派。”战士吴楚夫说：“军队绝不是生活在真空里，必须立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，绝对不能采取不介入主义，不能和稀泥。支持无产阶级革命派，就是保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。和稀泥，采取不介入的态度，在客观上就起了帮助敌人的作用，这是绝对不能允许的。”
    人民解放军要在文化大革命中立新功
    人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，一定要在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。座谈中，有的同志谈到，许多红卫兵在天安门前对他们说：“解放军同志，因为你们握紧了枪杆子，才有我们的大民主。”这些亲切的话语，使战士们十分感动。战士相宝进说：“革命前辈为建立政权立了功，我们要发扬光荣传统，在文化大革命中立新功。在无产阶级文化大革命夺权斗争的生死搏斗中，我们要百倍警惕地坚守岗位，随时准备粉碎国内外敌人的任何阴谋活动。在尖锐激烈的阶级斗争中，我们要‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’为保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级专政贡献我们的一切，甚至献出自己的生命。”怎样才能在文化大革命中做到立场坚定，旗帜鲜明？座谈中大家一致认为，最根本的是要活学活用毛主席著作，提高阶级觉悟，增强阶级斗争观念。同志们说：毛泽东思想是显微镜和望远镜，是最强大的武器，掌握了它，就能透过现象看本质，不论敌人耍什么鬼花招，都能识破，都能战胜。
