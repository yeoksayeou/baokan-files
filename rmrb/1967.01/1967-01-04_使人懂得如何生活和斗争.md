The people of Tanzania regard Chairman Mao's works as the most valuable treasure, drawing immense confidence and strength from them. After obtaining a Swahili version of "In Memory of Norman Bethune," worker Bashir of Tanzania could not put it down, reading it late into the night. He said: "Chairman Mao's works are truly excellent! They teach people how to work, how to live, how to struggle against imperialism, and how to build one's own country." A young Tanzanian worker, when discussing Chairman Mao's teachings on imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers, said: "Imperialism is nothing to be afraid of. If they dare to invade Tanzania, we will trample them underfoot and crush them." A shop assistant named Eugene, when talking about Chairman Mao's insightful statement that "The East Wind prevails over the West Wind," said that the imperialist system is like a setting sun, gasping its last breaths.

    坦桑尼亚人民把毛主席著作看作是最有价值的宝书，并从中吸取巨大的信心和力量。坦桑尼亚工人巴锡尔拿到一本斯瓦希利语的《为人民服务》后，爱不释手，一直阅读到深夜。他说：“毛主席的著作确实好极了！它使人懂得如何工作，如何生活，如何同殖民主义作斗争和如何建设自己的国家。”一位坦桑尼亚青年工人在谈到毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的教导时说：“帝国主义没有什么了不起。如果他们胆敢来侵犯我们坦桑尼亚，我们就将他们踩在脚下，把他们碾碎。”一位名叫尤金的店员在谈到毛主席关于“东风压倒西风”这一英明论断时说，帝国主义制度就像快要落山的太阳一样，正在奄奄一息。
