The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a serious test for everyone. For young students, the first question they face is whether they dare to make revolution and dare to rebel.

Since the Cultural Revolution is a revolution, it is inevitable that there will be resistance. Sometimes, this resistance can be a great pressure. Whether one dares to break through this pressure and rise up to make revolution often involves a struggle between proletarian ideology and personal selfish thoughts. Once selfish thoughts are overcome, one can bravely join the struggle. Therefore, the key to daring to make revolution lies in overcoming selfishness and establishing public spirit.

On June 1, 1966, when Nie Yuanzi and other comrades published their big-character poster, revolutionary teachers and students in our school also actively joined the struggle. However, soon after, the revolutionary masses faced suppression and attacks. Faced with fierce class struggle, my own thoughts were also in turmoil: In this great revolution, what attitude should I take? On which side should I stand? The problem was so acute that it demanded an immediate answer.

If I were to be bold and actively struggle, I would certainly encounter resistance and risks; if I were to be cautious and not struggle, then of course, it would be much safer.

What should I do? With these questions in mind, I studied the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao taught us to have no personal selfishness. In this great Cultural Revolution that concerns the fate of China and the world, how could I, when faced with a situation, first think of myself? Revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the revolutionary cause. How could we not abandon and sacrifice our personal interests?

After a fierce struggle in my thoughts, I finally stood up and, together with my revolutionary comrades, launched a fierce attack on the authorities who were taking the capitalist road.

The tests of revolutionary struggle came one after another. When the executors of the bourgeois reactionary line launched a new attack on revolutionary students, the thought of "fear" arose in my mind again. Should I continue to struggle? Or should I retreat? This time, it was our great leader Chairman Mao who gave me strength. Chairman Mao said: "Communists must be ready at all times to uphold the truth." Yes, since I have recognized the truth, why not uphold it? The reason is still fear of taking risks, fear of being attacked, fear of harming personal interests. Chairman Mao's teachings on serving the people wholeheartedly inspired me, and I made up my mind to get rid of selfish thoughts, uphold the truth, and stand firmly with the revolutionary masses. I was not afraid of being in the minority for the time being, nor was I afraid of facing all kinds of setbacks. I decided to fight to the end.

In the past half year or so of struggle, it has been a process of both fighting against the authorities within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line, and a process of my own continuous struggle to overcome selfishness and establish public spirit. Every time the revolutionary struggle reaches a critical moment, especially when the struggle encounters obstacles and reversals, my soul's selfish thoughts will be exposed. Every time I overcome these selfish thoughts, my ideological awareness will be raised, and my revolutionary courage will increase.

In the past half year or so, in the torrent of revolutionary struggle, I feel that I have begun to become stronger.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must not only overthrow the bourgeoisie but also overthrow the bourgeois ideological influences in our own minds. The more thorough our ideological revolution is, the more we can thoroughly overthrow the bourgeoisie. In the future, I will definitely insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, continuously overcoming selfishness and establishing public spirit, so that I can truly become a fearless revolutionary and contribute more to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    破私立公  越战越勇
    无产阶级文化大革命，对于每一个人都是一场严肃的考验。就青年学生来说，首先碰到的问题，就是敢不敢革命，敢不敢造反。
    文化革命既然是革命，就不可避免地会有阻力。有时候，这种阻力会是一种很大的压力。敢不敢冲破这种压力，起来革命，往往要经过一番无产阶级思想同个人主义私心杂念作斗争的过程。一旦战胜了私心杂念，就可以勇敢地投入斗争。所以，敢于革命的关键，在于破私立公。
    去年六月一日，聂元梓等同志的大字报一发表，我们学校的革命师生也积极起来投入斗争。可是过了不久，革命群众就受到了压制和打击。面对着激烈的阶级斗争，我的思想斗争也很激烈：在这场大革命中，自己究竟应该持什么态度？究竟站在哪一边？问题是这么尖锐地摆在面前，而且要求自己迅速作出回答。
    如果自己“敢”字当头，积极斗争，肯定会遇到阻力和风险；如果“保”字当头，不作斗争，那当然要“保险”得多。
    怎么办？我带着问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们，要毫无自私自利之心。在这场关系中国和世界命运的文化大革命中，难道我能一事当前，先替自己打算吗？革命先烈为了革命事业，不惜献出自己的生命，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能丢掉、不能牺牲吗？经过思想上的激烈搏斗，我终于挺身而出，和革命同志们一道，向走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火了。
    革命斗争的考验一个紧接一个。当资产阶级反动路线的执行者向革命同学展开新的进攻的时候，“怕”字在我思想里又抬了头。继续斗争呢？还是退缩不前呢？这次，又是我们伟大领袖毛主席给了我力量。毛主席说：“共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理”。对呀，既然认识到真理，为什么不坚持呢？原因还是怕冒风险，怕受打击，怕损害个人利益。毛主席关于全心全意为人民服务的教导鼓舞着我，使我下定决心，去掉私心杂念，坚持真理，决不动摇，坚定地与革命群众站在一起，不怕暂时处于少数地位，不怕遭受一切挫折，坚决斗争到底。
    这半年多的斗争生活，既是同党内走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线作斗争的过程，也是我自己不断破私立公的过程。每当革命斗争的紧要关头，特别是斗争遇到阻力出现反复的时候，自己灵魂深处的私心杂念就会暴露出来。每当自己战胜了私心杂念，思想觉悟就提高一步，革命的勇气也就增长一分。
    这半年多来，在革命斗争的激流里，我觉得自己开始变得坚强起来了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，既要革资产阶级的命，也要革自己头脑中的资产阶级思想影响的命。自己的思想革命搞得越彻底，就越能彻底地革资产阶级的命。今后，我一定要坚持活学活用毛主席著作，不断地破私立公，使自己真正成为一个无所畏惧的革命者，更好地在无产阶级文化大革命中贡献自己的力量。
