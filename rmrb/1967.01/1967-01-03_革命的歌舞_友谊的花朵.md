We watched the superb performance of the Albanian National Song and Dance Troupe with great excitement. The performances vividly depicted the heroic struggle of the Albanian people fighting on the front lines against imperialism and revisionism from various angles. The entire evening was filled with revolutionary fervor and the fraternal combat friendship between the peoples of China and Albania.

The performance by the Albanian Song and Dance Troupe allowed us to see the brilliant image of "a great socialist beacon in Europe." Amid the encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism, the heroic Albanian people have withstood the dark winds and broken through the evil waves. The song "The Conspiracy of the Revisionists Has Failed" expresses the Albanian people's contempt and hatred for revisionism. Together with the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world, they are waging an unyielding struggle to defend the revolutionary principles of Marxism, exposing the conspiracies of the revisionists, and will surely achieve even greater victories in the future.

Albania, which is advancing courageously on the path of revolution, is carrying out a great socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labor. The dance "Hills Turn into Fertile Fields" portrays the younger generation enthusiastically responding to the call of Comrade Hoxha and the Central Committee of the Party of Labor, rushing to the countryside, and advancing along the path of labor and revolution. This dance, with its vivid images, new vocabulary, and lively rhythm, depicts today's Albanian youth building socialism with a pickaxe in one hand and fighting imperialism and modern revisionism with a gun in the other. The chorus "In Praise of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor," the solo performance "The Strongest Voice of the Revolutionary People," and the dance "The Dance of the Guerrillas," among others, all express the strong revolutionary passion of the Albanian people. From their songs, music, and dance steps, we deeply understand the heroic character and revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people.

Throughout the evening, the great revolutionary friendship between the peoples of China and Albania was evident. A port worker from Durrës sang the song "Tirana-Beijing," which made us feel particularly close. His simple and powerful voice deeply touched our hearts. This voice is the voice of revolutionary friendship and the voice of our two peoples fighting together. Particularly moving was when the Albanian comrades sang our favorite songs in Chinese, such as "The Ship of State Needs a Helmsman" and "We Should Trust the Masses, We Should Trust the Party," based on quotations from Chairman Mao. When a singer, dressed in the uniform of an Albanian People's Army soldier, holding a red copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with affection, sang loudly, the audience below joined in singing with him: "We should trust the masses, we should trust the party. These are two fundamental principles. If we doubt these two principles, then we can accomplish nothing." The voices on stage and offstage blended into one, and the sincere feelings of Chinese and Albanian brothers were completely fused together.

"The Dance of Friendship" was the final performance of the evening. This dance fully expressed the unity, struggle, and great proletarian internationalism of the Chinese and Albanian peoples.

As our most beloved leader Chairman Mao said, "Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected," "No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." Let us join hands and, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, advance courageously on the path of revolution and in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism!

    革命的歌舞　友谊的花朵
    红兵
    我们怀着极其兴奋的心情观看了阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团的精湛表演。这些节目从各个不同的侧面，反映了战斗在反帝反修前线的阿尔巴尼亚人民英勇的斗争生活。整个演出晚会充满着革命的豪情，充满着中阿两国人民兄弟般的战斗友谊。
    阿尔巴尼亚歌舞团的演出，使我们看到了“欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯”的光辉形象。在帝国主义和现代修正主义重重包围之中，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民顶住了黑风，踏破了恶浪。《修正主义者的阴谋破产了》这首歌，表达了阿尔巴尼亚人民对修正主义的鄙视和仇恨；他们和中国人民以及世界革命人民一道，为捍卫马克思主义的革命原则进行着不屈不挠的斗争，戳穿了修正主义者的阴谋，今后必将取得更加伟大的胜利。
    在革命化大道上奋勇前进的阿尔巴尼亚，正在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下进行着伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设。舞蹈“山丘变良田”表现了年青一代，热烈响应霍查同志和劳动党中央的号召，奔赴农村，正在沿着劳动化、革命化的道路前进。这个舞蹈以生动的形象、崭新的语汇、明快的节奏，描绘出今天阿尔巴尼亚青年，一手拿镐建设社会主义；一手拿枪同帝国主义和现代修正主义作斗争的革命形象。合唱《歌颂劳动党第五次代表大会》，双弦琴独奏《革命人民的最强音》，舞蹈“游击队之舞”等等，都表达了阿尔巴尼亚人民的强烈的革命激情。从他们的歌声、琴声和舞步里，我们深刻地了解了阿尔巴尼亚人民山鹰般的英雄性格和革命精神。
    演出晚会始终洋溢着中阿两国人民的伟大的革命友情。一位来自都拉斯的海港工人唱着《地拉那—北京》歌曲，使我们感到格外亲切。他那质朴而浑厚的歌声紧紧扣动我们的心弦。这个声音是革命友谊的声音，也是我们两国人民团结战斗的声音。特别令人激动的是阿尔巴尼亚同志们还用中文演唱了我们最喜爱的《大海航行靠舵手》和毛主席语录歌：《我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党》等。当着一位歌手，穿着阿尔巴尼亚人民军战士的军服，带着亲切的感情，高举着鲜红的《毛主席语录》本，放声歌唱的时候，台下的观众一起随同这位阿尔巴尼亚同志同声高唱：“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”台上台下的歌声连成了一片，中阿兄弟的真挚感情完全水乳交融在一起了。
    “友谊之舞”是演出晚会的最后一个节目。这个舞蹈充分表现了中阿人民团结、战斗和伟大的无产阶级国际主义精神。
    正如我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席所说：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的”，“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起”。让我们携起手来，在毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，在反帝反修的斗争中，在革命化的大道上，奋勇前进吧！
