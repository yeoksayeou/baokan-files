The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia on January 11th lodged a strong protest with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry over the political persecution of overseas Chinese in West Kalimantan by the right-wing military authorities there, and the plot to forcibly relocate them on a large scale. The embassy demanded that the right-wing military regime in Indonesia immediately stop all persecution of overseas Chinese and effectively guarantee their legitimate rights and the safety of their lives and property.

The note said that on December 20, 1966, the commander of the 12th Military Region, Lia Gudu, issued a "decision" to persecute overseas Chinese, ordering that all leaders of overseas Chinese organizations in West Kalimantan be expelled from the province within one month. On the same day, Lia Gudu, at a rally, incited anti-Chinese sentiment, declaring that the aforementioned leaders of overseas Chinese organizations should be "immediately expelled," and their property should be "taken over by local authorities." He also stated that overseas Chinese in the region "are not allowed to reside outside county seats," and those residing in county seats "are not allowed to engage in retail trade or open shops."

The note pointed out that under the direct command of the military authorities in West Kalimantan, various incidents of persecution against overseas Chinese have occurred in different regions of the province. On December 27, 1966, the military authorities in Sanfay County issued an "order" to place all leaders of overseas Chinese organizations in the county under house arrest, prohibiting them from leaving their homes. On the same day, in places such as Shankouyang, Sanfay, Bangka, and Mengjiaming, large numbers of so-called "organizations for sending overseas Chinese back to their country" personnel went to the homes or shops of the aforementioned overseas Chinese, under the pretext of "registering property," ransacking their belongings, humiliating them in various ways, and threatening to "take over" the registered shops, ordering them to cease operations. At the same time, large-scale forced relocations of overseas Chinese appeared in various regions of West Kalimantan. In addition, many regions frequently saw incidents of army soldiers extorting and bullying overseas Chinese, and brutally beating them.

The note said: "The above situation shows that the military authorities in West Kalimantan are launching a new and more rampant anti-Chinese campaign, putting tens of thousands of overseas Chinese living there in a situation where their livelihoods are cut off, they are homeless, and their lives and property are seriously threatened. For this reason, the Chinese Embassy has lodged a strong protest with the Indonesian government and demands that it immediately stop all political persecution of overseas Chinese, stop the forced relocation of overseas Chinese, stop the violence of beating and persecuting overseas Chinese, and effectively guarantee the legitimate rights and the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese."

    印尼西加里曼丹右派军事当局变本加厉迫害华侨
    我大使馆向印尼政府提出强烈抗议
    据新华社十三日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十一日就西加里曼丹右派军事当局对当地华侨进行政治迫害，阴谋大规模逼迁的严重事件，向印度尼西亚外交部提出强烈抗议，并严正要求印尼右派军人政权，立即停止对华侨的一切迫害，切实保障华侨的正当权益和生命财产的安全。
    照会说，一九六六年十二月二十日第十二军区司令利亚·古都发布了一项对华侨进行政治迫害的“决定书”，要把西加里曼丹辖区内所有华侨团体的负责人，在一个月内驱逐出该省。同日，利亚·古都在一次集会上大肆煽动反华排华，说要把上述华侨团体的负责人“立即驱逐出去”，他们的财产要“由地方掌权者接管”。他还宣称，当地华侨“不得在县城以外地区居住”，而居住在县城的华侨将“不得经营零售商或开设商店”。
    照会指出，在西加里曼丹军事当局的直接指挥下，该省各地区连续发生了种种迫害华侨的事件。一九六六年十二月二十七日，三发县军事当局发布“命令”，对所有三发县内的华侨团体负责人实行软禁，不准他们离开自己的住宅。当天在山口洋、三发、邦戛、孟加映等地，又出动了大批所谓“遣送华侨回国机构”的人员，到上述华侨的住宅或商店，以“登记财产”为名，翻箱倒柜，进行搜查，百般污辱华侨，扬言要“接管”这些被登记过的商店，并勒令他们停止营业。与此同时，西加里曼丹各地区出现了大规模逼迁华侨的活动。此外，许多地区不断发生陆军士兵对华侨贪得无厌地进行敲诈勒索，任意欺侮和野蛮殴打华侨的事件。
    照会说：“上述情况表明，西加里曼丹军事当局正在掀起一个新的更加猖狂的反华排华运动，使居住在当地数以千计的华侨，面临生计断绝，流离失所，生命财产遭到严重威胁的境地。为此中国大使馆向印度尼西亚政府提出强烈的抗议，并严正要求立即停止对华侨的一切政治迫害，停止对华侨的逼迁，制止殴打和迫害华侨的暴行，切实保障华侨的正当权益和生命财产的安全。”
