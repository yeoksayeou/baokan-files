Our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great democratic movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the Cultural Revolution, our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, trusts the masses, relies on the masses, mobilizes the masses, respects the masses' initiative, and supports the revolutionary masses in widely using the forms of great democracy such as big debates, big-character posters, big meetings, and big linking-up to launch a general offensive against the enemy. At the same time, he allows the broad masses to criticize and supervise all levels of leadership organs and cadres. Among the masses and between various mass organizations, the methods of great democracy are also used to unify understanding, unify thinking, raise consciousness, and grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This great democracy is the best school for the broad masses to learn Mao Zedong Thought.

The people of the great Mao Zedong era enjoy the broadest and most extensive great democracy in human history.

In the past few months, red flags have flown and songs have soared from the Yangtze River to the Great Wall. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great democratic movement is surging forward. Hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers have been mobilized, as have revolutionary young people. A handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the ghosts and monsters in society, have been dragged out into the light of day, with nowhere to hide.

Heroic Red Guards have emerged. With the resolute and enthusiastic support of our great leader Chairman Mao, they have gone from schools to the streets and society, smashing the old and establishing the new. They have swept away the filth and dregs left over from the old society with their revolutionary brooms. They dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to make revolution. Many long-standing difficult problems have been solved in front of them. Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, they have fought resolutely against the capitalist reactionary line. The heroic Red Guards have become the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution, achieving countless great deeds. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

When we enjoy the broadest great democracy in human history under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, have you ever thought about how hard-won this great democracy of ours is? Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, how could there be great democracy! Today's iron-clad mountain of the proletariat was won with the blood and lives of the martyrs! They smashed the reactionary rule of the domestic and foreign class enemies with their revolutionary fists, burned the "freedom" and "democracy" of the bourgeoisie, and brought about today's true freedom and democracy!

Chairman Mao tells us: "In the world, there is only concrete freedom and concrete democracy, not abstract freedom and abstract democracy. In a society of class struggle, if there is the freedom of the exploiting class to exploit the laboring people, there is no freedom of the laboring people not to be exploited. If there is bourgeois democracy, there is no proletarian and laboring people's democracy."

The democracy of the exploiting class is false democracy, hypocritical democracy, democracy for the enjoyment of a few ruling classes, democracy of a few people oppressing the majority. Under the grand facade of "democracy," the broad laboring people have no rights in life and no freedom in death, while the exploiting class builds their paradise on the white bones of the poor.

Today, the great democracy we practice is great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the highest and most genuine proletarian democracy in human history. This is a new development of Chairman Mao's mass line, a new form of the combination of Mao Zedong Thought with hundreds of millions of people.

Revolutionary practice tells us that without the great democracy of the proletariat, it is impossible to launch a genuine Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and carry it through, impossible to achieve a great revolution in people's minds, impossible to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, impossible to prevent the revisionist elements from usurping the leadership of the Party and the state, impossible to prevent the dictatorship of the proletariat from turning into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and impossible to drag hundreds of millions of laboring people back into the abyss of the old society. As Chairman Mao said: "...let the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and monsters all come out, while our cadres do nothing about it, and many of them even do not distinguish between enemies and ourselves, collude with the enemy, are corrupted and infiltrated by the enemy, split and disintegrated, pulled out and pushed in, and many workers, peasants, and intellectuals are also corrupted and infiltrated by the enemy in various ways. If this is the case, it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at the least, a few dozen years at the most, to inevitably bring about a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist Party will definitely become a revisionist party, a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." What a dangerous situation this would be! It is clear that this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has great historical significance.

Our great democracy is great democracy under the concentrated guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Differences of opinion among the masses should be resolved through debate, presenting facts and reasoning, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and not by suppressing others. In the people's internal affairs, if only one's own opinions are allowed and different opinions are not allowed, this violates the principles of great proletarian democracy.

Our great democracy is for the realization of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the development of socialist causes. Anyone who deviates from the interests of the proletariat and other laboring people, deviates from socialism, and deviates from the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is not the great democracy of the proletariat.

Our great democracy is great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is obvious that without a solid dictatorship of the proletariat, there would be no great democracy for the people. Some people, taking advantage of the Cultural Revolution, arbitrarily violate the policies of the Party and the state and engage in activities against and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. This is absolutely unacceptable to us.

Our great democracy is distinctly class-based, created to maintain the interests of the proletariat and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. A handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line constantly change their tactics, play tricks, and under the banner of "great democracy," shout the slogan of "criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line," confuse right and wrong, deceive, and cheat, waving the "red flag" against the red flag, and firing cannons at the revolutionary headquarters of the proletariat. Can we allow them to do this? Absolutely not!

Lenin pointed out: "Whoever merely acknowledges class struggle is not a Marxist, he may still be within the confines of bourgeois thought and bourgeois policy.... Only those who acknowledge class struggle and at the same time acknowledge the dictatorship of the proletariat are Marxists." Every revolutionary must be good at observing and studying the trends of various classes and various phenomena, exposing the tricks of the class enemy, cutting off the counter-revolutionary claws of the class enemy reaching out to the revolutionary people, and implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat. Those who only acknowledge class struggle but do not acknowledge the dictatorship of the proletariat are one hundred percent confused, one hundred percent revisionists!

To ensure the normal conduct of big debates, big-character posters, big meetings, and big linking-up, we must implement dictatorship and legal punishment against the active counter-revolutionaries in the Cultural Revolution.

True revolutionaries are fearless. No matter what ghosts and monsters there are, no matter whether they are those in power within the Party who take the capitalist road and wear the tiger skin of "great democracy," or whether they are hypocrites who cover themselves with the "freedom" and "democracy" of the bourgeoisie, or whether they are counter-revolutionary clowns who are arrogant but actually stupid, they will never frighten or deceive the revolutionary people!

The great democratic revolutionary torrent mobilized among 700 million people is unstoppable by any force. In history, there have often been some "heroes" who, not knowing their own limits, have tried to pull the wheel of history backward, or have tried to throw dirty water and garbage into the revolutionary current, attempting to confuse and disrupt the revolutionary ranks. But the surging revolutionary tide has swept them away, swallowed them up, and at most, only a few bubbles have been splashed.

The thunderous sound of a thousand jin opens up a new era, and the east wind blowing over ten thousand li disperses the clouds. Under the leadership of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is the surging torrent of the great democratic movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, is surging forward under the bright sunlight, washing away the entire old world. A bright red new world is beginning to appear on the horizon.

    发扬无产阶级专政下的大民主
    李冠昌
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是在毛泽东思想统帅下的大民主运动。
    在文化大革命中，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，支持革命群众广泛采用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连这些大民主的形式，向敌人举行总攻击；同时让广大群众批评和监督各级领导机关和领导干部；在群众之间，在各个群众组织之间，也运用大民主的方法统一认识，统一思想，提高觉悟，掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。这种大民主，是广大群众学习毛泽东思想最好的学校。
    伟大的毛泽东时代的中国人民，享受着人类历史上空前的最广泛的大民主。
    几个月以来，大江南北，长城内外，红旗招展，歌声飞扬。在毛泽东思想统帅下的大民主运动，气势磅礴，汹涌澎湃。亿万工农兵群众发动起来了，革命的青少年发动起来了，一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派，社会上的牛鬼蛇神，一个一个地被揪到光天化日之下，无处藏身。
    英雄的红卫兵出现了。在伟大的领袖毛主席坚决的热烈的支持下，他们从学校走向街头，走向社会，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新。他们抡起革命的铁扫帚，横扫旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水，残渣余孽。他们敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命，许许多多老大难的问题在他们面前迎刃而解。在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，他们对资产阶级反动路线作了坚决的斗争。英雄的红卫兵成了文化大革命的急先锋，建立了无数丰功伟绩。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    当我们在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，享受着人类历史上最广泛的大民主的时候，你可曾想过，我们今天的大民主是多么的来之不易。没有无产阶级专政，哪能有大民主！今天无产阶级的铁打江山，是烈士们用鲜血和生命换来的！他们用革命的铁拳砸烂了国内外阶级敌人的反动统治，焚烧了资产阶级的“自由”和“民主”的遮羞布，换来了今天真正的自由和民主！
    毛主席告诉我们：“世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。有了资产阶级的民主，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的民主。”
    剥削阶级的民主，是假民主，是虚伪的民主，是只供少数统治阶级享受的民主，是一种少数人压迫多数人的民主。在富丽堂皇的“民主”的幌子之下，广大的劳动人民生无权利，死无自由，而剥削阶级却在穷人的白骨堆上建立起他们的幸福天堂。
    今天，我们所实行的大民主，是无产阶级专政下的大民主，是人类历史上从来没有过的高度的真正的无产阶级民主。这是毛主席的群众路线的新发展，是毛泽东思想同亿万群众相结合的新形式。
    革命的实践告诉我们，没有无产阶级的大民主，就不可能发动真正的无产阶级文化大革命并且把它搞深搞透，就不可能实现人们灵魂深处的大革命，就不可能巩固无产阶级专政，就不可能防止反革命修正主义分子篡夺党和国家的领导，就不可能防止无产阶级专政演变为资产阶级专政，就会把千百万劳动人民拉向旧社会的罪恶深渊，就会像毛主席所说的那样：“……让地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来，而我们的干部则不闻不问，有许多人甚至敌我不分，互相勾结，被敌人腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来，许多工人、农民和知识分子也被敌人软硬兼施，照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”这是一种多么危险的情景啊！可想而知，这场无产阶级文化大革命，具有何等重要的历史意义。
    我们的大民主，是在毛泽东思想集中指导下的大民主。群众之间的不同意见，要在毛泽东思想指导下，摆事实、讲道理，进行辩论，求得解决，而不能压制别人。在人民内部，如果只允许自己发表意见，不允许别人发表不同的意见，这就违背了无产阶级大民主的原则。
    我们的大民主，是为了实现无产阶级文化大革命，发展社会主义事业。谁要是背离了无产阶级和其他劳动人民的利益，背离了社会主义，背离了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，这决不是无产阶级的大民主。
    我们的大民主，是无产阶级专政下的大民主。显而易见，如果没有巩固的无产阶级专政，也就没有人民群众的大民主。有些人乘文化大革命之机，任意违反党和国家的政策，进行反对和破坏文化大革命的活动，这是我们绝对不能容许的。
    我们的大民主是具有鲜明的阶级性的，是为维护无产阶级的利益、巩固无产阶级专政而创造的。一小撮钻进党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，不断变换手法，玩弄权术，打着“大民主”的旗号，喊着“批判资产阶级反动路线”的口号，混淆是非，招摇撞骗，打着“红旗”反红旗，炮打无产阶级革命司令部。我们能允许他们这样做吗？决不能！
    列宁指出：“谁要是仅仅承认阶级斗争，那他还不是马克思主义者，他可能还没有走出资产阶级思想和资产阶级政策的圈子。……只有承认阶级斗争、同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者。”我们每个革命者必须善于观察和研究各阶级的动向和各种现象，识破阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，斩断阶级敌人伸向革命人民的反革命魔爪，实行无产阶级专政。那种只承认阶级斗争，而不承认无产阶级专政的人，是百分之百的糊涂虫，是百分之百的修正主义！
    为了保证大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的正常进行，对于文化大革命中的现行反革命分子，必须实行专政，依法制裁。
    真正的革命者是无所畏惧的。不管是何等的牛鬼蛇神，不管是披上“大民主”虎皮的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，是扯资产阶级的“自由”和“民主”的遮羞布的伪君子，还是气壮如牛、其实蠢笨如驴的反革命群丑，决然吓不倒革命的人民，也骗不了革命的人民！
    在七亿人口中所发动起来的大民主的革命洪流，是任何力量也阻挡不了的。历史上，常有些不自量力的“英雄好汉”，妄图把历史车轮拉向后转，或者向革命的清流泼脏水，倒垃圾，企图混淆和扰乱革命阵线。但一泻千里的革命怒涛，却把他们席卷而去，吞没了他们，最多只是溅起几个泡沫而已。
    千钧雷声开新宇，万里东风吹残云。行看云雨过去，旭日当空，由我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，即在毛泽东思想统帅下的大民主运动的滚滚巨流，正迎着灿烂的阳光，汹涌澎湃，冲刷着整个旧的世界。一个红通通的新世界正在地平线上开始出现。
