We, the Red Flag fighters of Beijing Aviation Institute, heard on the radio the "Statement to the People of Shanghai" by the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and ten other revolutionary mass organizations, as well as the editorial note from the People's Daily. We were so excited that we jumped up. This is a very important document. It not only expresses the feelings of the revolutionary workers of Shanghai but also the feelings of our Red Guards. This document sounds the charge for a continued fierce counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line, which will surely push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into a broader and deeper new stage. The editorial note of the People's Daily embodies Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's greatest concern and support for us revolutionaries! We, the Red Flag fighters, enthusiastically acclaim this battle declaration and enthusiastically acclaim the rebirth of the Wenhui Daily and the Liberation Daily in the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

"Revolutionize and promote production" is Chairman Mao's great call. The revolutionary workers of Shanghai are resolutely following Chairman Mao's instructions. We enthusiastically support your revolutionary actions!

A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and those who stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line have been plotting and scheming to sabotage the cultural revolution in factories. We, the Red Flag fighters of Beijing Aviation Institute, have deeply experienced this. We follow Chairman Mao's teachings that intellectuals must combine with the workers and peasants. As early as last October, we went to factories to propagate the "Sixteen Points" and Mao Zedong Thought. This caused great panic among those bourgeois gentlemen. In many factories, slogans appeared on the walls: "Protest against the interference of the Red Flag of Beijing Aviation Institute in our factory's cultural revolution," "Drive the Red Flag of Beijing Aviation Institute out!" They even incited some workers who did not understand the truth to attack us. This exposed their true faces of sabotaging production and the cultural revolution. We fought back against them and did everything possible to go among the workers. Revolutionary workers defended their production posts and fought side by side with us, finally smashing their plots.

Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again... until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause." That handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and those who stubbornly insist on the bourgeois reactionary line will not deviate from this logic. They continue to play new tricks. They continue to instigate people to fight people, provoke armed struggles, neglect production, work passively, and even sabotage and stop production to sabotage the cultural revolution. Our revolutionary workers, with the national interest in mind, understand the big picture and the overall situation. They are extremely concerned about the revolution and extremely concerned about production. In one factory, revolutionary workers missed some production due to the cultural revolution. These revolutionary workers, with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, showed great enthusiasm and not only made up for the production but also overfulfilled the production tasks. These comrades did well and did right!

Facing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, the broad revolutionary workers of Shanghai are in an even more complex and difficult situation. But they fight very bravely and have set a great example for the people of the whole country. We should learn from the fearless revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary workers of Shanghai and the high sense of revolutionary responsibility of the working class. In the new year, we will hold high the great red flag of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑——热烈欢呼《告上海全市人民书》和《人民日报》发表的重要编者按
    迎头痛击资产阶级反动路线的新反扑

    我们北航红旗战士从广播里听到了上海工人革命造反总司令部等十一个革命群众组织的《告上海全市人民书》和《人民日报》的编者按，高兴得跳了起来。这是一个极其重要的文件。它不仅说出了上海广大革命工人的心里话，也说出了我们红卫兵的心里话。这个文件吹响了继续向资产阶级反动路线猛烈反击的冲锋号，必将把无产阶级文化大革命推向一个更广阔、更深入的新阶段。《人民日报》的编者按体现了毛主席和党中央对我们革命造反者的最大的关怀、最大的支持！我们红旗战士最热烈地欢呼这个战斗的宣言，最热烈地欢呼《文汇报》和《解放日报》在无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中得到新生！
    “抓革命，促生产”是毛主席的伟大号召，上海的革命工人坚决按毛主席的指示办事，我们最热烈地支持你们的革命行动！
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，破坏工厂文化大革命的种种阴谋诡计，我们北航红旗战士是深有体会的。我们遵循毛主席关于知识分子必须与工农群众相结合的教导，早在去年十月就到工厂去宣传“十六条”，宣传毛泽东思想。这就引起了那些资产阶级老爷们的极大惊慌。不少工厂的墙上出现了这样的标语：“抗议北航红旗干预我厂文化大革命”，“把北航红旗赶出去！”他们还挑动一部分不明真象的工人围攻我们。这就赤裸裸地暴露了他们破坏生产，破坏文化大革命的真面目。我们针锋相对地同他们进行斗争，千方百计地到工人中去。革命工人坚守生产岗位，和我们一起并肩战斗，终于粉碎了他们的阴谋。
    毛主席说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”，那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，也绝不会违背这个逻辑。他们继续玩弄新的花样。他们继续挑动群众斗群众，挑起武斗，对生产放任自流，消极怠工，甚至破坏生产、停止生产，来破坏文化大革命。我们的革命工人以国家利益为重，识大局，顾大体，既极端关心革命，又极端关心生产。一个工厂的革命工人因搞文化革命耽误了一点生产，这些革命工人以高度的革命责任感，发挥了冲天的干劲，不仅补偿了生产，而且还超额完成了生产任务。这些工人同志干得好，做得对！
    面临资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，上海的广大革命工人处于更加复杂、更加困难的境地。但他们战斗得十分英勇，为全国人民作出了伟大的榜样。我们要学习上海革命工人的大无畏的革命造反精神和工人阶级高度的革命责任感，在新的一年里，更高地举起以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
