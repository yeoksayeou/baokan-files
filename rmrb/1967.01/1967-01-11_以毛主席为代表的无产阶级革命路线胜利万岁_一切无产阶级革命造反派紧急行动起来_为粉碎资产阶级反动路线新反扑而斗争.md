Revolutionary workers in Tianjin, Shenyang, and seven other cities enthusiastically acclaim the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the editorial note of the People's Daily

	Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency report: Revolutionary workers in the cities of Tianjin, Shenyang, Chengdu, Chongqing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou warmly welcome and firmly support the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" issued by the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and ten other revolutionary mass organizations, as well as the extremely important editorial note published by the People's Daily. Revolutionary workers in these seven cities have been studying and discussing the document over the past few days and unanimously believe that the People's Daily's publication of this document and its editorial note is the greatest support from our beloved leader Chairman Mao for the revolutionary rebels. It has greatly suppressed the arrogance of a small handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary rebels. We revolutionary workers resolutely respond to the great call of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production." We are determined to defeat the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and push the current proletarian cultural revolution to a new high, achieving victory in both revolution and production.

	Revolutionary workers in Tianjin are extremely excited, saying that this document hoists high the great red banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and sounds the bugle for a continued fierce counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line. It speaks the hearts of revolutionary workers. Workers at the Tianjin Dyeing and Chemical Factory No. 2 say: We, the working class, are the main force of the cultural revolution and the model for promoting production. We will never leave the great thought of Mao Zedong and the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" advocated by Chairman Mao.

	In the past two days, the city of Shenyang has been echoing with the resounding voice of "grasp revolution, promote production, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line" from morning to night. Revolutionary rebel workers excitedly say that the "Letter to the People of Shanghai" by the Shanghai revolutionary rebel worker comrades is a fierce blow to the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. It thoroughly exposes their evil conspiracy to sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution and socialist production and construction. Ten revolutionary rebel organizations in a machine tool factory in Shenyang angrily expose that a small handful of people are paying lip service to Chairman Mao's instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production." They are playing new tricks to achieve their evil goal of protecting themselves and sabotaging the proletarian cultural revolution. They incite some masses to raise issues such as wages, ranks, living allowances, and labor protection benefits, making a big fuss to try to buy people's hearts with small favors and reverse the direction of the struggle, leading the movement astray. We are workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. No matter what tricks this small handful of people play, we can see through them and expose them. These ten revolutionary rebel organizations warn in their appeal to the people of the city that those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line will meet a bad end. The Revolutionary Rebel Committee of the Shenyang Gas Compressor Factory immediately held a meeting to discuss the issue of "grasp revolution, promote production" and promptly drafted a telegram to notify the representatives going to Beijing to return to the factory immediately.

	Revolutionary rebel workers in Chengdu and Chongqing are determined to carry out the spirit of this document and the editorial note of the People's Daily in their future actions. In a recent period, a small handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line in the Red Rock Machinery Factory in Chongqing incited a large number of deceived workers in the patrol teams to leave their production posts and deliberately created numerous difficulties in the supply of tools, raw materials, transportation, etc., attempting to sabotage production and strike at the revolutionary masses. However, the soldiers of the "August 31st" Combat Team and other revolutionary rebel workers in the factory promptly exposed and smashed the tricks of that small handful of people. They carried forward the spirit of proletarian revolutionary hard bones, insisted on "grasp revolution, promote production," with one person doing the work of several, and took on the heavy responsibility of the entire factory's production, completing the annual national plan seven days ahead of schedule. The soldiers of the "August 31st" Combat Team proudly say: "We are revolutionary hard bones. No matter how great the obstacles, we will not be stopped in our revolutionary steps; no matter how great the difficulties, we will not bend the backs of the revolutionary rebels!"

	Revolutionary masses in Xi'an are determined to carry out the cultural revolution to the end with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and to do a good job in production work, not falling into the traps set by a small handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. Revolutionary workers at the Xi'an Xinhua Printing Factory, which is responsible for printing Chairman Mao's works, have, in the proletarian cultural revolution, exposed those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and obstructing the printing of Chairman Mao's works. The production situation in the entire factory has been greatly improved. In 1966, the factory overfulfilled the national production task, making it the year with the most printed works of Chairman Mao since the factory started production in 1964 and the year with the best completion of production tasks. The revolutionary masses of the factory unanimously expressed that they will not only verbally but also in action firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "grasp revolution, promote production," seizing every minute and second, with a high-speed and high-quality combat posture, to print well the most precious treasure in the world, Chairman Mao's works.

	Revolutionary workers in Guangzhou believe that this is a very timely and correct revolutionary document. It is a great support and encouragement to the revolutionary masses in Guangzhou and throughout the country. They expressed that they must take immediate action, firmly implement Chairman Mao's great call, and be models, vanguards, and backbone in "grasp revolution, promote production." Many revolutionary workers at the Guangzhou Power Plant said that the power plant is closely related to the production and life of the entire city. We must firmly guard our production posts and prevent any attempt to sabotage production from succeeding. Workers in this plant have been adhering to the eight-hour work system during the cultural revolution. Under the powerful promotion of the cultural revolution movement, they overfulfilled the power supply plan for last year by 11.9%.

	Many revolutionary rebel workers in factories in Hangzhou proudly say that only the revolutionary rebels truly listen to Chairman Mao's words and have achieved "grasp revolution, promote production." We will definitely guard our production posts, overcome various difficulties, and with one person doing the work of ten, take on the heavy responsibility of production, giving the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line a blow to the head. Many workers in the Zhejiang Cotton Textile Mill and the Hangzhou First Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Mill, who were previously deceived, after studying this extremely important document, presented a large number of facts, angrily exposing the crimes of a small handful of people inciting workers to leave their production posts without authorization, sabotaging production, and sabotaging the proletarian cultural revolution. They expressed their determination to return to the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, respond to Chairman Mao's call of "grasp revolution, promote production," carry out the revolution well, and guard their production posts.

    以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁
    一切无产阶级革命造反派紧急行动起来
    为粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑而斗争
    天津沈阳等七城市的革命工人热烈欢呼《告上海全市人民书》和《人民日报》编者按
    综合新华社消息：天津、沈阳、成都、重庆、西安、广州、杭州等市广大革命工人热烈欢迎和坚决拥护上海工人革命造反总司令部等十一个革命群众组织的《告上海全市人民书》和《人民日报》所写的极其重要的编者按。这七个城市的革命工人，连日进行了学习和讨论，一致认为《人民日报》转载这个文件和发表编者按，是最敬爱的领袖毛主席对革命造反派工人的最大的支持，大灭了一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人的威风，大长了革命造反派的志气。我们革命工人坚决响应最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，决心打垮资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，将当前的无产阶级文化大革命推向一个新高潮，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    天津广大革命工人无比兴奋地说，这个文件高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大红旗，吹响了继续向资产阶级反动路线猛烈反击的号角，它说出了革命工人的心里话。天津染化二厂工人说：我们工人阶级是文化大革命的主力军，也是促生产的模范。我们一定寸步不离伟大的毛泽东思想，寸步不离毛主席提出的抓革命，促生产的方针。
    这两天，沈阳全城从早到晚响彻着“抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”的响亮声音。革命造反派的工人们兴奋地说，上海革命造反派的工人兄弟这个告全市人民书，是对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的迎头痛击，彻底戳穿了他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏社会主义生产建设的罪恶阴谋。沈阳一家机床厂的十个工人革命造反组织，怀着满腔的愤怒揭露说，一小撮人对毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示阳奉阴违，他们为了达到保护他们自己，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶目的，又施展了新的阴谋。他们挑唆一些群众把工资、级别、生活福利、劳保待遇等问题提出来，大轰大闹，企图用小恩小惠收买人心，扭转斗争的大方向，把运动引向邪路。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人，心最红，眼最亮，不论这一小撮人玩弄什么阴谋花招，我们都能够识破它，揭穿它。这十个革命造反组织在给全市人民的呼吁书中向一小撮极端反动的家伙发出警告说，顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人没有好下场。沈阳气体压缩机厂的无产阶级革命造反委员会的委员，立即开会研究抓革命，促生产的问题，并当即拟出电报，通知去北京的代表立即返厂。
    成都、重庆革命造反派职工决心把这个文件和《人民日报》编者按的精神贯彻到今后的实际行动中去。重庆红岩机器厂前一段时期，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人，煽动了大批受蒙蔽的工人纠察队员离开了生产岗位，并故意在工具、原材料供应、运输等方面制造了重重困难，妄图破坏生产，打击革命群众。但是，厂里“八·三一”战斗团战士和其他革命造反派职工，及时揭发和粉碎了那一小撮人的阴谋诡计。他们发扬无产阶级革命硬骨头精神，坚持抓革命，促生产，一人顶数人，担负起了全厂生产的重担，并提前七天完成了全年国家计划。“八·三一”战斗团的战士们豪迈地说：“我们是革命的硬骨头，阻力再大，也不能阻挡我们的革命步伐；纵有天大困难，也休想压弯革命造反派的脊梁！”
    西安广大革命群众决心以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，既要把文化大革命进行到底，又要把生产工作搞好，决不上党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人所玩弄的圈套。承担毛主席著作印制任务的西安新华印刷厂的革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中，把抵制印制毛主席著作的党内走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来后，全厂的生产面貌焕然一新，一九六六年超额完成了国家生产任务，成为这个厂一九六四年开工生产以来印制毛主席著作最多的一年，也是生产任务完成得最好的一年。这个厂的革命群众一致表示：不但要在口头上而且要在行动上坚决响应毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，争分夺秒，以高速度、高质量的战斗姿态，印好世界上最珍贵的宝书毛主席著作。
    广州市广大革命职工认为，这是一个非常适时、非常正确的革命文件，它对广州和全国的革命群众是一个极大的支持和鼓舞。他们表示，一定要紧急行动起来，坚决实现毛主席的伟大号召，做“抓革命，促生产”的模范、先锋和骨干。广州电厂的许多革命职工说，电厂对全市生产和人民生活关系很大，我们一定要坚守生产岗位，防止任何企图破坏生产的阴谋得逞。这个厂的职工在文化大革命中一直坚持八小时工作制，在文化大革命运动的有力推动下，超额百分之十一点九，完成了去年的供电计划。
    杭州许多工厂的革命造反派工人自豪地说，只有革命造反派最听毛主席的话，真正做到了“抓革命，促生产”。我们一定坚守生产岗位，克服种种困难，以一当十，挑起生产重担，给资产阶级反动路线的新反扑以当头一棒。浙江麻纺厂和杭州第一棉纺织印染厂许多过去受蒙蔽的职工，学习了这个极其重要的文件后，摆出了大量事实，愤怒控诉一小撮人煽动工人擅自离开生产岗位，破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪行。他们表示要回到以毛主席为代表的革命路线上来，响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，搞好革命，坚守生产岗位。
