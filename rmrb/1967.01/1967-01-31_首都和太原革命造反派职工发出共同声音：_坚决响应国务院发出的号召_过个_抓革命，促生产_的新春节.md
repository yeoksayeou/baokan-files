Workers in Beijing and Taiyuan Respond to the State Council's Call to "Seize the Revolution and Promote Production" During the Spring Festival

	Newspaper reports that after the State Council's announcement that the Spring Festival would not be celebrated this year, revolutionary workers in Beijing and Taiyuan held meetings and rallies to respond enthusiastically. They vowed to follow Chairman Mao's directive to "seize the revolution and promote production," to stay at their posts, and to work hard to make the Cultural Revolution and production even better.

	At Beijing Railway Station, propaganda vehicles repeatedly broadcast the State Council's notice. Many revolutionary masses preparing to board trains discussed: The State Council's notice is correct! At this crucial moment when the proletarian revolutionaries are seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, we cannot leave our battle stations or our production posts. We firmly respond to the State Council's call and will celebrate a Spring Festival of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." Many who were planning to return home for the holidays immediately went to the ticket office to cancel their tickets. An official from Baotou, who was transferring in Beijing on his way to Hangzhou, heard the broadcast and immediately changed his ticket to return to Baotou. Some staff members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences who were preparing to leave Beijing not only decided not to leave but also immediately informed other staff members who were about to buy train tickets, persuading them not to return home for the holidays.

	The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Motorcycle Factory firmly support the State Council's decision. They said they would follow Chairman Mao's teachings to "carry forward the spirit of daring to fight, daring to sacrifice, daring to endure hardships, and fighting continuously (that is, fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," and during the Spring Festival, they would stay at their battle and production posts, seize the revolution, and promote production.

	The revolutionary workers of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory enthusiastically hailed the State Council's decision, saying it was timely and good, and expressed their support. They said: Recently, a handful of diehards clinging to the capitalist reactionary line have tried to lure workers away from their production posts by increasing the number of leave-takers and advancing loans. Now, their plots have been completely foiled. At this time when the proletarian revolutionaries are uniting and seizing power, we must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, work hard, and achieve double victories in revolution and production.

	Newspaper reports that revolutionary workers in various factories and mines in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, announced at a rally held this morning that they enthusiastically support the State Council's decision not to celebrate the Spring Festival this year and will firmly implement Chairman Mao's directive to "seize the revolution and promote production," achieving double victories in revolution and production.

	The revolutionary workers of the Taiyuan Locomotive Measurement Factory, which has been seized by the revolutionary rebels, originally planned not to take a holiday during the Spring Festival. After hearing the State Council's decision, they joyfully said that the decision reflected their demands. Before the revolutionary rebels seized power in this factory, the power-holders inside did not arrange production tasks, causing losses in locomotive production. In the first eighteen days of January, only two locomotives were completed, and there was a danger of not completing the monthly task. But after the revolutionary rebels seized power on the 18th, the workers competed to be pioneers in revolution and production, finding ways to catch up with the production tasks. By today, they have completed the January locomotive production plan ahead of schedule. The revolutionary workers said that now that they have seized power and become the masters, they must push the revolution and production to new heights.

	The Shanxi Red Rebels Alliance Taiyuan Locomotive Factory Workers Revolutionary Rebel Team also issued an initiative to workers to achieve double victories in revolution and production during the Spring Festival. Many workers in the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory canceled their purchased train tickets and decided not to return home for the holidays. An official from the Design Department had already reached the train station but returned to the factory after hearing the broadcast. The revolutionary rebels in this factory are responding to the State Council's decision and are mobilizing the masses to decide to launch a new high tide in revolution and production.

　　首都和太原革命造反派职工发出共同声音：
　　坚决响应国务院发出的号召
　　过个“抓革命，促生产”的新春节
    新华社三十日讯　国务院关于今年春节不放假的决定发表以后，首都革命造反派职工纷纷召开座谈会、誓师大会，积极地响应，表示一定要按照毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的指示，坚守战斗岗位，鼓足革命干劲，把文化大革命和生产搞得好上加好。
    在首都的“大门”——北京车站的广场上，一些革命组织的宣传车反复广播国务院的通知。许多准备上车的革命群众纷纷议论：国务院的通知说得对！在无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开全面夺权的关键时刻，我们不能离开战斗岗位，也不能离开生产岗位。我们坚决响应国务院的号召，过一个“抓革命，促生产”的新春节。许多准备回家探亲的人，立刻到车站售票处退票。从包头去杭州的一个干部在北京转车时听到广播，立刻换了回包头的车票。中国科学院的一些准备离京的职工不仅自己不离京了，还立刻告诉一些正准备去买火车票的职工，动员他们春节不回家探亲。
    北京市摩托车厂革命造反派工人坚决拥护国务院的决定。他们表示，一定要按照毛主席的教导，“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”，在春节期间，坚守战斗岗位和生产岗位，抓革命，促生产。
    北京第一机床厂的革命造反派工人热烈欢呼：国务院的决定发得及时，发得好，说出了我们革命造反派工人的心意，我们坚决拥护。他们说：最近，一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，用增加探亲假人数、提早借钱等手段，引诱工人离开生产岗位。现在，他们的阴谋彻底破产了。在一天等于二十年的无产阶级革命派大联合、大夺权的时候，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，百倍地提高革命警惕性，鼓足干劲，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    新华社太原三十日电　山西省太原市各厂矿革命造反派工人在今天上午举行的无产阶级革命造反派大联合、大夺权誓师大会上宣布，热烈拥护国务院关于今年春节不放假的决定，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席提出的抓革命、促生产的方针，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    由革命造反派夺了权的太原机车测量工厂的革命职工，原来已经打算春节不休假。他们在听到国务院的决定以后，兴高采烈地说，这个决定反映了他们的要求。这个厂的革命造反派夺权以前，由于厂内的当权派不安排生产任务，使机车生产受到损失，一月份头十八天中仅完成两台机车，全月任务有完不成的危险。但十八日革命造反派夺权以后，工人们争当革命和生产的闯将，想方设法赶生产任务，到今天已提前完成一月份机车生产计划。革命造反派职工表示，自己夺了权，当了家，一定把革命、生产推向新的高潮。
    山西省红色造反者联盟太原机车厂工人革命造反团还向工人发出倡议，在春节期间夺取革命、生产双胜利。太原矿山机器厂许多职工退了已购买的火车票，春节不回家了。设计科一个干部已经到了火车站，听到广播后又回到了厂里。这个厂的革命造反派响应国务院的决定，正在发动群众决心掀起革命、生产新高潮。
