Chairman Mao said: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental change in the social economic system."

Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought,
The national urban and rural markets are vibrant and the situation is excellent.

The broad masses of financial and commercial workers, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have earnestly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, vigorously propagated Mao Zedong Thought, and completed various tasks quickly, efficiently, and economically.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 3rd, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, said: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental change in the social economic system." In the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan—1966—our country's financial and commercial frontline workers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their guiding principles, strove to transform their worldviews and promote ideological revolutionization, thereby completing various tasks quickly, efficiently, and economically.

This year, on the basis of a comprehensive leap in industrial and agricultural production, the state's financial revenue and expenditure were balanced, the volume of commodity procurement and sales increased significantly, inventories increased, currency circulation was normal, prices remained stable, and urban and rural markets were more prosperous than ever.

The total value of procurement of industrial and agricultural products nationwide in 1966 increased significantly compared to the previous year. Among them, the procurement volume of major agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, flue-cured tobacco, hemp, pigs, poultry, and vegetables increased across the board on the basis of continuous growth in the past few years, and the quality also improved compared to the past.

The total retail sales of market commodities in 1966 also increased significantly compared to the previous year. Among them, the supply of agricultural machinery, fertilizers, pesticides, and other commodities supporting agricultural production increased by 30 to 40 percent compared to the same period last year, and the semi-mechanized agricultural tools needed to achieve agricultural mechanization increased by more than 60 percent. The supply of cotton cloth, towels, socks, underwear, cotton and wool sweaters, rubber shoes, enamel products, and other daily necessities for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers increased across the board. High-value items such as bicycles, sewing machines, radios, and watches also increased by about 20 to 30 percent. This indicates that the purchasing power of urban and rural people in our country has further improved. The supply of commodities such as paper, ink, red satin, paint, loudspeakers, and tape recorders needed for the Cultural Revolution increased by several times to several dozen times.

Since the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, urban and rural markets have shown a more distinct socialist commercial character through the destruction of the Four Olds and the establishment of the Four News, presenting a brand-new situation. Many stores' old signs and names with capitalist, feudal, and semi-colonial characteristics, as well as the old trademarks, designs, and shapes of some commodities, have been replaced by new signs, trademarks, designs, and shapes with revolutionary content. Certain outdated practices that have persisted for decades, even centuries, have been swept away. The counters, display windows, and shelves inside and outside many urban and rural stores are covered with quotations from Chairman Mao, and displays of Chairman Mao's works, turning the entire market into a bastion for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

The vibrant and excellent situation in the national urban and rural markets is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It reflects the great achievements of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and financial and commercial workers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, who have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, achieved ideological revolutionization, and transformed spiritual strength into material strength.

Since last year, especially since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers and commune members in our country have earnestly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, grasped the revolution, and promoted production, making industrial and agricultural production achieve a comprehensive leap and providing a solid material foundation for the market. The broad masses of financial and commercial workers have enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, using the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a weapon, thoroughly breaking down all selfish thoughts, and establishing a communist worldview of selflessness, striving to use the high standard of "completely, thoroughly" serving the people to do a good job in various tasks in the circulation sector.

The broad masses of financial and commercial workers not only use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldviews but also, in procurement, supply, transportation, and storage business work, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, making the broad masses and financial and commercial workers, based on Mao Zedong Thought, unify their thoughts and understanding, thereby completing various business tasks more, faster, better, and more economically. Last year, when procuring grain, oil, cotton, and hemp and other agricultural products, many regions' grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives all put Mao Zedong Thought in the forefront. They first propagated to the masses Chairman Mao's instructions on grain work and commercial work and the Party's procurement policies, raising the masses' socialist awareness, and then carried out procurement work. Some counties, before the procurement of agricultural products, organized the masses throughout the county to hold a big discussion on the sale of agricultural products. During the discussion, they extensively spoke about Chairman Mao's instructions on preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people, extensively spoke about the domestic and international good situation, and extensively spoke about the Party's policies and principles. Through the discussion, the broad masses of commune members understood that they should "have a heart for the country and an eye for the world" and bear heavy responsibilities for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. They carried forward the spirit of "selflessness and altruism" and "selflessness," according to the principle of balancing the interests of the state, collective, and individual, selling good grain to the state as early as possible. The entire county significantly overfulfilled the grain and oil procurement tasks. Many rural financial and commercial grassroots units also established Mao Zedong Thought study guidance stations and organized Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, crossing mountains and valleys, going deep into communes and production brigades, and using all available venues such as mass meetings, street markets, and fields to launch a grand propaganda campaign for Mao Zedong Thought.

Now, the broad masses of financial and commercial workers are using the "two-line struggle" viewpoint to summarize their situation and work of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, finding the gaps between themselves and the advanced units and advanced individuals on the PLA and other fronts, taking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the key link, and further launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

    毛主席说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下
    全国城乡市场生气勃勃形势大好
    广大财贸职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，认真活学活用毛主席著作，大力宣传毛泽东思想，多快好省地完成各项工作任务
    据新华社三日讯　我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”第三个五年计划的第一年——一九六六年，我国财贸战线广大职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“老三篇”为座右铭，努力改造世界观，促进思想革命化，从而多快好省地完成了各项工作任务。
    这一年，在工农业生产全面跃进的基础上，国家财政收支平衡，商品收购和销售量大幅度上升，库存增加，货币流通正常，物价继续稳定，城乡市场比过去更加繁荣兴旺。
    全国工农业产品的收购总值，一九六六年比上年有了大幅度的增长，其中粮食、棉花、烤烟、麻类、生猪、家禽、蔬菜等主要农副产品的收购量，在过去几年持续增长的基础上，一九六六年都全面增加，质量也比过去提高。
    市场商品的零售总额，一九六六年也比上年显著增长。其中，支援农业生产的农田排灌机械、化肥、农药等商品的供应量比上年同期增加了百分之三十到四十，实现农业机械化所需要的半机械化农具更猛增百分之六十以上。广大工农兵日常生活必需的棉布、毛巾、袜子、卫生衫裤、棉毛衫裤、胶鞋、搪瓷制品等商品的供应量，都全面增长。价值较高的自行车、缝纫机、收音机、手表等，也增长了百分之二十到三十左右。这标志着我国城乡人民的购买力有了进一步的提高。文化大革命所需要的纸张、笔墨、红绸、油漆、扩音器、录音机等商品的供应量更是成倍地以至数十倍地增加。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，城乡市场通过破四旧、立四新，更加鲜明地显示出社会主义商业的特色，出现了一派崭新的气象。许多商店的带有资本主义、封建主义、半殖民地色彩的旧招牌、旧字号，一部分商品的旧商标、旧图案、旧造型，都已为具有革命内容的新招牌、新商标、新图案、新造型所代替。某些沿袭了几十年、甚至上百年的陈规陋习被一扫而光。城乡许多商店的柜台内外，橱窗、货架，到处张贴了毛主席语录，陈列了毛主席著作，使整个商场成了宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。
    全国城乡市场这种生气勃勃的大好形势，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。它反映了我国广大工农群众和财贸职工在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，实现思想革命化，并且把精神力量转化为物质力量的巨大成果。
    去年以来，特别是开展无产阶级文化大革命运动以来，我国广大职工和公社社员，认真活学活用毛主席著作，抓革命、促生产，使工农业生产出现了全面跃进的大好形势，为市场提供了雄厚的物质基础。广大财贸职工，热烈响应林彪同志的号召，以“老三篇”为武器，大破各种私心杂念，大立一心为公的共产主义世界观，力求用“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的高标准来做好流通领域里的各项工作。
    广大财贸职工不仅用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，而且在收购、供应、调运、保管等业务工作中，还大力宣传毛泽东思想，使广大群众和财贸职工在毛泽东思想的基础上，统一思想、统一认识，从而使各项业务工作完成得又多、又快、又好、又省。去年在收购粮食、油料、棉花、麻类等农产品时，许多地区的粮食部门和供销合作社都做到毛泽东思想领先。他们首先向群众宣传毛主席关于粮食工作和商业工作的指示，宣传党的收购政策，提高群众的社会主义觉悟，然后再进行收购工作。有的县在征购农产品以前，组织全县群众展开了一次交售农产品的大讨论，在讨论过程中，大讲毛主席关于备战、备荒、为人民的指示，大讲国内外大好形势，大讲党的方针政策。通过讨论，广大社员懂得了要“胸怀祖国，放眼世界”，为中国革命和世界革命挑重担。他们发扬“毫不利己专门利人”，“一心为公”的共产主义精神，按照兼顾国家、集体、个人利益的原则，尽早地把好粮食卖给国家，全县大幅度地超额完成了粮食和油料的收购任务。许多农村财贸基层单位还建立了毛主席著作学习辅导站，组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，翻山越岭，深入社队，利用群众大会、街头闹市、田间地头等一切可以利用的场合，展开了声势浩大的宣传毛泽东思想的活动。
    现在广大财贸职工正以“一分为二”的观点，总结自己活学活用毛主席著作的情况和工作，寻找自己同人民解放军和其他战线先进单位、先进人物的差距，以无产阶级文化大革命为纲，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
