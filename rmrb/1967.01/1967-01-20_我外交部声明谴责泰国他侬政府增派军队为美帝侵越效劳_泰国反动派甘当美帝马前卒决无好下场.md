The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on the 19th denouncing the Thanom government of Thailand for sending ground troops to participate in the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam, and for allowing U.S. B-52 strategic bombers to be stationed in Thailand. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
	January 19, 1967

On January 6, the Thanom government of Thailand announced that it would send 1,000 ground troops to participate in the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam. According to reports from Western news agencies, U.S. B-52 strategic bombers have already been stationed in Thailand. This is a new adventurist move by the Thanom clique following its dispatch of naval and air forces to South Vietnam last May.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Central Committee of the Vietnam National Liberation Front's External Relations Commission have each issued statements strongly condemning the provocative actions of the Thai authorities. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully support the just stance of the Vietnamese people.

The U.S. imperialists have long used Thailand as a base for their war of aggression against Vietnam, using the Thai reactionaries as their advance guards to suppress the peoples of Indochina, and at the same time directing their aggression towards China. For a long time, the U.S. has invested heavily in Thailand, building military facilities, sending more invading troops, and driving the Thai authorities to continuously invade and interfere with neighboring countries. After the so-called Manila Conference last year, the Johnson administration further colluded with the Thanom clique, secretly formulating a sinister plan to expand the use of Thai military bases and to have Thailand provide cannon fodder. Now, the Thanom clique, despite strong opposition from people both at home and abroad, has openly announced the dispatch of ground troops to South Vietnam and allowed U.S. B-52 strategic bombers to be stationed in Thailand. This shows that the Thai reactionaries have further involved themselves in the vortex of the U.S. imperialists' expanded war of aggression.

The U.S. imperialists have been beaten black and blue in their war of aggression against Vietnam, with nearly 400,000 invading troops and various new weapons, yet they still cannot change the passive situation of being on the defensive. Adding 1,000 Thai cannon fodder and sending some B-52 strategic bombers to Thailand will not be able to reverse the failure of U.S. imperialism. However, the Thanom clique should know that Thailand is right next to Indochina. By doing this, aren't you afraid that the war ignited by the U.S. will burn your own country? You are willing to sell out national sovereignty and national interests, and to serve the U.S. policy of aggression and war. The Vietnamese people and the peoples of Indochina will certainly counterattack resolutely, and the Thai people will also further unite to oppose you.

Chairman Mao said: "If the U.S. monopolistic capitalist clique insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably one day be executed by the people of the whole world. Other U.S. accomplices will also meet the same fate." Since the Thai reactionaries have decided to link their fate with that of U.S. imperialism, they can only go down the path of doom and will have no other outcome.

    我外交部声明谴责泰国他侬政府增派军队为美帝侵越效劳
    泰国反动派甘当美帝马前卒决无好下场
    新华社十九日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十九日发表声明，谴责泰国他侬政府将派遣地面部队到南越参加美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，以及允许美国派遣B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国。声明全文如下：
          中华人民共和国外交部声明
                  一九六七年一月十九日
    一月六日，泰国他侬政府宣布，将派遣一千名地面部队，参加美帝国主义侵略越南的战争。又据西方通讯社报道，美国的B—52型战略轰炸机已进驻泰国。这是他侬集团继去年五月派遣海、空军到南越之后所采取的新的冒险行动。
    越南民主共和国外交部和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会，已经分别发表声明，强烈谴责泰国当局的挑衅行为。中国政府和中国人民完全支持越南人民的严正立场。
    美帝国主义一直把泰国当作它侵略越南战争的基地，把泰国反动派当作镇压印度支那各国人民的马前卒，同时也把它的侵略矛头指向中国。长期以来，美国在泰国投下了大笔赌注，修建军事设施，增派侵略军队，驱使泰国当局不断对邻国进行侵略和干涉。在去年的所谓马尼拉会议之后，约翰逊政府又同他侬集团加紧勾结，暗中制定了扩大使用泰国军事基地和要泰国提供炮灰的罪恶计划。现在，他侬集团不顾国内外人民的强烈反对，公然宣布向南越派出地面部队，并且允许美国的B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国。这就表明，泰国反动派已经进一步卷入了美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的漩涡。
    美帝国主义在侵略越南的战争中，已经被打得焦头烂额，走投无路。它派了近四十万的侵略军，使用了各种新式武器，都不能改变被动挨打的局面，再增加一千名泰国炮灰，派遣一些B—52型战略轰炸机到泰国去，也决不能挽救美帝国主义的失败。但是，他侬集团应该知道，泰国就在印度支那的旁边，你们这样做，难道不怕美国点燃的战火会烧到自己的身上来吗？你们不惜出卖国家主权和民族利益，甘心为美国的侵略政策和战争政策效劳，越南人民和印度支那各国人民必将坚决回击，泰国人民也必将进一步团结起来，大造你们的反。
    毛主席说：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”泰国反动派既然决心把自己的命运同美帝国主义联系在一起，那只能是死路一条，决不会有其他的下场。
