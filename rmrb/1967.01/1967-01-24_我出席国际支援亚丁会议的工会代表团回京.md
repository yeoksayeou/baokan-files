	The delegation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which attended the Third Session of the International Trade Union Committee in Support of the Workers and People of Aden, returned to Beijing by plane today.

	During the conference, the delegation engaged in an uncompromising struggle against the crimes of Soviet revisionists and the World Federation of Trade Unions in sabotaging the conference. Today, they were warmly welcomed by revolutionary comrades and relevant personnel from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions headquarters. The welcoming crowd at the airport strongly condemned the latest anti-China farce staged by the Soviet revisionists, the big henchmen of U.S. imperialism.
