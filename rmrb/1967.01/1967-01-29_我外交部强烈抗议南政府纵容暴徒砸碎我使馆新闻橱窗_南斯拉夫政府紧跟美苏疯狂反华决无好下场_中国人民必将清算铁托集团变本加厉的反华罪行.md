The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly protests the Yugoslav government's tolerance of hooligans smashing the news window of our embassy. The Yugoslav government, following the frenzied anti-China stance of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, will not have a good outcome. The Chinese people will surely settle accounts with the Tito clique's escalating anti-China crimes.

BEIJING, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) — The responsible official of the European and Soviet Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned the acting charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Embassy in China, Kolub, on January 28, and handed him a note, strongly protesting the Yugoslav government's tolerance of hooligans smashing the news window of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia and deliberately creating a serious political provocation.

The note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: On the evening of January 20, while the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Yugoslavia was holding a reception for Asian and African students, the news window displaying a photograph of Chairman Mao Zedong, the most beloved great leader of the Chinese people, was completely destroyed. This is a very serious political provocation, disrupting the normal diplomatic activities of our embassy, infringing upon our country's sovereignty and the security of our embassy, and inciting hostility between China and Asian and African countries. In particular, the insult and defamation of Chairman Mao's portrait is an insult and defamation of the People's Republic of China and the 700 million Chinese people, which is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. The Chinese government strongly protests to the Yugoslav government and demands that the Yugoslav government publicly acknowledge this as a serious anti-China political incident, severely punish the perpetrators, and ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future.

The note pointed out: This anti-China incident is not accidental or isolated. You have always followed your masters, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, in their frenzied attacks on China's domestic and foreign policies, especially the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong. Your leaders and newspapers have continuously issued a large number of anti-China clamors, attempting to deceive the Yugoslav people and divert their attention from overthrowing your rule. Let me tell you frankly: You will end up hurting yourselves by throwing stones. Your anti-China actions will not have a good outcome.

The acting charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Embassy, caught off guard and at a loss for words, dared not accept our note of protest and tried to evade responsibility in every way. The responsible official of the European and Soviet Affairs Bureau of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave him a stern rebuke.

BEIJING, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) — BELGRADE, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) — A group of Yugoslav hooligans carried out a serious political provocation in front of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on the evening of January 20, smashing the news window of the Chinese Embassy.

That evening, while the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia was holding a movie night to entertain students from Asian and African countries studying in Yugoslavia, a group of Yugoslav hooligans armed with pre-prepared tools came to the front of the Chinese Embassy and smashed the news window to pieces before fleeing in a hurry. The window displayed pictures including: the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, the most, most great leader Chairman Mao Zedong; photographs of the Chinese working class under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, "seizing the revolution and promoting production"; and photographs of the Chinese people supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The Tito clique, like bats fearing the light, are extremely afraid of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and are extremely terrified of the deep affection between Asian and African students and the Chinese people. They attempted to provoke the Chinese people through smashing the news window of the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese people are not to be trifled with; they will surely settle accounts with the Tito clique's escalating anti-China crimes.

After this premeditated serious political provocation, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, Shen Zhiyi, summoned the head of the Asia-Australia Division of the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs, N. Milicevic, on January 21, to lodge a solemn protest with the Yugoslav authorities. Shen Zhiyi, the acting charge d'affaires, emphasized in his protest that smashing the news window of the Chinese Embassy was a premeditated, organized political provocation, an infringement upon our country's sovereignty and the security of the embassy.

It is truly a case of lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet. The provocative actions of the Yugoslav hooligans aroused the extreme indignation of the Asian and African students attending the Chinese Embassy's reception. An African student said, "Let them smash! They can smash the glass, but they can't smash Mao Zedong Thought!" Many Asian and African students, upon hearing of this incident, angrily said, "This is truly despicable!" An African student raised his glass and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" to express his love for the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and his strong protest against the provocative behavior of the Yugoslav authorities.

The despicable behavior of the Yugoslav hooligans in smashing the news window of the Chinese Embassy also caused great discontent among the broad masses of the Yugoslav people. Many people, upon seeing the smashed window, expressed their condemnation of this provocative behavior to the staff of the Chinese Embassy. A worker said, "This behavior is extremely despicable. I never imagined that such a thing could happen in our Yugoslavia!"

　　我外交部强烈抗议南政府纵容暴徒砸碎我使馆新闻橱窗
　　南斯拉夫政府紧跟美苏疯狂反华决无好下场
　　中国人民必将清算铁托集团变本加厉的反华罪行
    新华社二十八日讯 中华人民共和国外交部苏欧司负责人二十八日召见南斯拉夫驻华大使馆临时代办哥洛布，并交给他一份照会，强烈抗议南斯拉夫政府纵容暴徒砸碎中国驻南斯拉夫大使馆新闻橱窗，蓄意制造严重政治挑衅事件。
    我外交部照会说：一月二十日晚，正当中华人民共和国驻南斯拉夫大使馆对外举行亚非留学生招待会之际，使馆展出有中国人民最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席照片的新闻橱窗，被全部砸毁。这是一件极其严重的政治挑衅事件，破坏我使馆的正常外交活动，是对我国主权和我使馆安全的侵犯，并挑拨我和亚非国家的友好关系。特别是对毛主席像的侮辱和诋毁，就是对中华人民共和国，对中国七亿人民的侮辱和诋毁，这是中国人民绝对不能容许的。对此，中国政府向南斯拉夫政府提出强烈抗议，要求南斯拉夫政府公开承认这是一个严重的反华政治事件，必须严惩肇事者，并保证今后不再发生此类事件。
    照会指出：这次反华事件绝不是偶然的、孤立的。你们一直紧跟着你们的主子美帝国主义和苏联修正主义，对中国的内外政策，特别对中国人民伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命进行疯狂的攻击。你们国家领导人和报刊不断地发出了大量的反华叫嚣，妄图欺骗南斯拉夫人民，转移南斯拉夫人民起来造你们的反、推翻你们的统治的目标。老实告诉你们：搬起石头砸自己的脚，你们的反华决不会有好下场的。
    南斯拉夫大使馆临时代办做贼心虚，理屈词穷，不敢接受我抗议照会，并百般抵赖。我外交部苏欧司负责人予以严厉痛斥。
    新华社二十八日讯贝尔格莱德消息：一群南斯拉夫暴徒二十日晚在中国驻南斯拉夫大使馆前面进行严重政治挑衅，砸碎中国大使馆的新闻橱窗。
    这天晚间，正当中国驻南斯拉夫大使馆举行电影晚会招待亚非国家留南斯拉夫学生的时候，一伙南斯拉夫暴徒，手执事先准备好的工具，来到中国大使馆前面，将中国大使馆的新闻橱窗砸得粉碎，然后仓惶逃去。在这个橱窗里展出的图片中有：中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳，中国人民最最伟大的领袖毛主席的照片；中国工人阶级在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，“抓革命，促生产”的照片；以及中国人民支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的照片。
    铁托叛徒集团像蝙蝠惧怕阳光一样，非常惧怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对亚非国家学生对中国人民的深厚情谊无比恐惧，竟然企图通过砸碎中国大使馆的新闻橱窗来对中国人民进行严重政治挑衅。中国人民不是好惹的，他们必将清算铁托集团变本加厉的反华罪行。
    在这一预谋的严重政治挑衅事件发生以后，中国驻南斯拉夫大使馆临时代办申志伟二十一日约见南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处亚澳司司长尼·米利切维奇，向南斯拉夫当局提出严正抗议。申志伟代办在抗议中强调指出，砸碎中国大使馆新闻橱窗是一件事先有计划、有组织的政治挑衅事件，是对我国主权和使馆安全的侵犯。
    真是搬起石头砸自己的脚。南斯拉夫暴徒的这一挑衅行动引起了参加中国大使馆招待会的亚非国家学生的无比愤慨。一个非洲学生说：“让他们砸吧！他们能砸碎橱窗玻璃，但是砸不掉毛泽东思想！”很多亚非学生听到这件事以后愤怒地说：“这真丑恶！”一个非洲学生举杯高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”以表达他对世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的热爱和对南斯拉夫当局的挑衅行为的强烈抗议。
    南斯拉夫暴徒砸碎中国大使馆新闻橱窗的恶劣行为在南斯拉夫广大人民中也引起了很大不满。很多人在目睹被砸的橱窗后对中国大使馆人员表示谴责这种挑衅行为。一名工人说：“这种行为真是恶劣之极，我真想不到在我们南斯拉夫竟出现这种事！”
