The Baoding Fertilizer Plant, with an annual production capacity of 12,000 tons of ammonium bicarbonate, has recently been completed and started production. The Baoding Fertilizer Plant was constructed during the height of the Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of workers enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, taking "The Three Articles" as their guiding principles, eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, promoting the revolutionization of thought, making the project progress rapidly, saving expenses, and ensuring the quality of the project.

    保定化肥厂建成并投入生产
    年产一万二千吨碳酸氢铵的保定化肥厂，最近建成并投入生产。保定化肥厂是在文化大革命高潮中动工兴建的。广大职工热烈响应林彪同志的号召，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，破私立公，促进思想革命化，使工程进展很快，而且节约了开支，保证了工程质量。
