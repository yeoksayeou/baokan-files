	Newspapers must be in the hands of the revolutionary left!
	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The thousand and one truths of Marxism boil down to a single one: 'Rebellion is justified.'" Rebellion is justified, and revolution is guiltless! We most enthusiastically acclaim the rebirth of the *Liberation Daily*! We most resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary rebels of the *Liberation Daily*! You are right to rebel! You rebel well! You rebel justly!

	In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the old *Liberation Daily* was a faithful tool for implementing the bourgeois reactionary line in the Shanghai region. For a long time, it has been stubborn and unrepentant. The recent large-scale incident of "the *Liberation Daily* incident," where the masses fought against the masses, is another major exposure of this bourgeois reactionary line. And in this incident, the *Liberation Daily* Party Committee, in collusion with a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, has committed unforgivable crimes against the Party and the people. Such a Party Committee, such a newspaper, must be thoroughly criticized and thoroughly reformed. All power to the left! The world is ours. The state is ours. Society is ours. If we do not speak, who will? If we do not act, who will? Now, we must work hard and make the newspapers truly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary left, making them a stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and serving the proletariat. Let us unite, fight together, and win together!

	Let us, the revolutionary rebels, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and turn the *Liberation Daily* into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

	Let us shout:
	Long live the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries!
	Defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death! Long live the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line with Chairman Mao as the representative!
	Thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line!
	Long live the great Communist Party of China!
	Long live our red sun, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!

    报纸必须掌握在革命左派手里
    毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”造反就是有理，革命就是无罪！我们最最热烈欢呼《解放日报》获得新生！我们最最坚决地支持《解放日报》革命造反派的革命行动！你们这个反造得对！造得好！造得有理！
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，旧《解放日报》是上海地区贯彻资产阶级反动路线的忠实工具，长期以来，执迷不悟，毫无悔改之意。最近发生的大规模的群众斗群众的“解放日报事件”，是这条资产阶级反动路线的又一次大暴露。而《解放日报》党委在这一事件中，和一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派狼狈为奸，对党对人民又犯下了不可饶恕的罪行。这样的党委，这样的报纸，一定要彻底批判，一定要彻底改造。一切权力归左派！天下者，我们的天下。国家者，我们的国家。社会者，我们的社会。革命的事情，我们不说，谁说？我们不干，谁干？现在，我们就是要大干特干，使报纸真正掌握在无产阶级革命左派手里，使报纸成为宣传毛泽东思想的坚强阵地，为无产阶级服务。让我们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    让我们革命造反派高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把《解放日报》办成毛泽东思想的大学校！
    让我们高呼：
    无产阶级革命造反精神万岁！
    誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线！以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    彻底打倒资产阶级反动路线！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
