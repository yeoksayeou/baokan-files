The People's Liberation Army warmly responds to the great leader Chairman Mao's great call
Grasp the rifle firmly and resolutely support the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in seizing power

The PLA soldiers sternly warn those who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line: Only the proletarian revolutionary faction is allowed to seize power, and you are not allowed to plot a counter-revolution! Anyone who dares to sabotage the Cultural Revolution and engage in counter-revolutionary activities will be subjected to proletarian dictatorship, resolutely suppressed, and completely annihilated!

Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: Beat the war drums, blow the bugles, Chairman Mao issues a new battle order: The People's Liberation Army must resolutely support the revolutionary faction of the proletariat; sharpen your eyes, grasp your rifles, the people's soldiers warmly respond to the great leader Chairman Mao's call, resolutely supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction in their struggle to seize power!

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, who are vigilantly guarding the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, heard from the radio this morning that the People's Liberation Army Daily editorial "The People's Liberation Army Resolutely Supports the Revolutionary Faction of the Proletariat," and exclaimed with joy and excitement: This is the most beloved leader Mao Zedong, issuing a new battle order in the new stage of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat! This great call, like a spring thunder, shakes the earth and mountains, giving the greatest support and encouragement to the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, and striking fear into the hearts of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. The soldiers and officers expressed: Our army is the revolutionary army of the proletariat created by Chairman Mao. We will follow Chairman Mao's words one hundred percent, act one hundred percent according to Chairman Mao's instructions, stand one hundred percent on the side of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, and support one hundred percent the proletarian revolutionary rebels in seizing power. If the enemy does not surrender, we will annihilate them completely! If the enemy dares to plot and sabotage the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we will smash them to pieces!

The soldiers and officers of the Navy, Air Force, and many units in Beijing, Nanjing, Fuzhou, Kunming, Shenyang, Wuhan, Jinan, and other places listened to the broadcast again and again. They raised their arms and shouted: "Resolutely support the revolutionary faction of the proletariat!" "Long live the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" The songs "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and those based on Chairman Mao's quotations echoed through the clouds. The soldiers and officers held discussions, put up wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers, wrote poems and articles, and expressed their determination to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Their revolutionary spirit was more invigorated, and their fighting will was more ardent. The soldiers and officers of many units of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed on the front line in Fujian immediately brought their letters and guarantees of resolutely following Chairman Mao's words and firmly supporting the revolutionary faction of the proletariat to the unit leadership to express their determination. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Air Force in Zhejiang and the direct subordinates of the Tibet Military Region were so excited that they held up giant portraits of Chairman Mao, singing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman," and gathered together in a grand and solemn oath-taking ceremony. At the oath-taking ceremony of the direct subordinates of the Tibet Military Region, the soldiers and officers read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "The Chinese Red Army is a group armed to carry out revolutionary political tasks. Especially now, the Red Army is not just fighting. In addition to fighting to annihilate the enemy's military force, it also has to undertake the major tasks of propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses to establish a revolutionary government, and even establishing the organization of the Communist Party." The soldiers and officers solemnly vowed to Chairman Mao: We will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary rebels. To support the revolutionary rebels in their struggle to seize power, we will dare to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea! We will stand firm even if the sky falls and fill the earth if it collapses.

The soldiers and officers of many units in Guangzhou, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and the Tibet Military Region warmly applauded the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, implementing the great alliance and launching a comprehensive struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. While studying and discussing the editorial of the People's Liberation Army Daily, they reviewed Chairman Mao's statements on the nature of the people's army, further deepening their understanding that resolutely supporting the revolutionary faction of the proletariat is the greatest political task of the People's Liberation Army. Since the day Chairman Mao personally created the Red Army, our army has been the most steadfast in standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly standing on the side of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, and resolutely supporting all revolutionary actions of the proletarian revolutionary faction. The soldiers and officers of the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Railway Engineering Corps, which has been rated as a model company for six consecutive years, said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The Chinese Red Army is a group armed to carry out revolutionary political tasks.' From the day we picked up the rifle, we think, say, and do only one thing: seize power. Seize power for the proletariat, seize power for communism. Seizing power is our political task. Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, we have gone through decades of bloodshed and sacrifice to seize power. However, the class enemies are not willing to die. They have infiltrated the party, usurped the leadership of some places and some departments, and attempted to restore capitalism in China. In the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat implements the great alliance and, with the momentum of a mountain-collapsing and sea-overturning struggle, launches a comprehensive struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, seizing the great power back into the hands of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat. This is a matter of great importance to our country's eternal revolution and never-changing color for thousands of years, and it is the greatest politics of the proletariat. We and the revolutionary faction of the proletariat are class brothers as close as flesh and blood. We face the same enemy, we have the same revolutionary goal. We must wholeheartedly, unhesitatingly, and wholeheartedly support them in seizing power. Even if they are temporarily in the minority, we will still support them without hesitation. The soldiers of a certain guard company of a unit in the Beijing Military Region said, "Serving the people wholeheartedly is the nature of the people's army. Seizing and defending power for the proletariat is the greatest service to the people. Whether or not we most resolutely support the revolutionary faction of the proletariat is the criterion for measuring whether we are 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people. Today, in this fierce class struggle, we must, with the spirit of 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions, and most resolutely support the revolutionary faction of the proletariat in their struggle to seize power. The officers and soldiers of a certain company of the Nanjing Military Region, where Cai Yongxiang was formerly stationed, said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary.' In this nationwide comprehensive class struggle, everyone must face a severe test, either standing on the side of the revolutionary people or on the opposite side of the revolutionary people, there is no middle ground. The so-called 'non-interference' of the army is sheer nonsense. We are revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with the most distinct class stance. We love the revolutionary faction of the proletariat the most and resolutely support the revolutionary rebels. We will, like Comrade Cai Yongxiang, defend the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat with our lives, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

Many soldiers and officers expressed firmly in discussions that the People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. The rifles given to us by Chairman Mao are used to defend the proletarian headquarters, to defend the people's interests and the proletarian dictatorship. We will firmly grasp the rifles in our hands and resolutely support the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in their struggle to seize power, defending the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat in their struggle to seize power. We are always vigilant against any plots and sabotage activities of the class enemies. We sternly warn those who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line: Only the revolutionary faction of the proletariat is allowed to seize power, and you are not allowed to plot a counter-revolution! Anyone who dares to sabotage the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and engage in counter-revolutionary activities will be subjected to proletarian dictatorship, resolutely suppressed, and completely annihilated!

On January 25th, the editorial "The People's Liberation Army Resolutely Supports the Revolutionary Faction of the Proletariat" published in the People's Liberation Army Daily was immediately organized for study and discussion by the pilots of a certain unit of the Air Force at the airport. They unanimously expressed their active response to Chairman Mao's great call, most resolutely supporting and assisting the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, and carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

　　人民解放军热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召
　　握紧枪杆坚决支持无产阶级革命造反派起来夺权
    解放军指战员严厉警告那些走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子：只准无产阶级革命派夺权，不许你们阴谋变天！谁胆敢破坏文化大革命，进行反革命活动，就坚决对他们实行无产阶级专政，坚决镇压，彻底消灭！
    新华社二十五日讯　擂起战鼓，吹响军号，毛主席发出新的战斗命令：人民解放军要坚决支持无产阶级革命派；擦亮眼睛，握紧枪杆，人民战士热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，坚决支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争！
    日夜警惕地保卫着无产阶级文化大革命的人民解放军广大指战员，今天清晨从广播里听到《解放军报》社论《人民解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命派》，欢欣鼓舞地说：这是最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，在无产阶级文化大革命的新阶段，向我们发出的新的战斗命令！这一伟大号召，像一声春雷，地动山摇，给了无产阶级革命派最大的支持，最大的鼓舞，吓得党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，魂飞魄散。指战员们表示：我军是毛主席亲手缔造的无产阶级革命军队，我们百分之百地听毛主席的话，百分之百地按毛主席的指示办事，百分之百地站在无产阶级革命派一边，百分之百地支持无产阶级革命造反派起来夺权。敌人不投降，就叫它彻底灭亡！敌人胆敢耍阴谋，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，就坚决把它砸个稀巴烂！
    海军、空军和北京、南京、福州、昆明、沈阳、武汉、济南等许多部队指战员，一遍又一遍地收听了广播，他们振臂高呼：“坚决支持无产阶级革命派！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”《大海航行靠舵手》和根据毛主席语录谱成的歌曲声，响彻云霄。指战员们纷纷举行座谈讨论，出墙报、黑板报，写诗作文，向毛主席和党中央表示决心，革命精神更加振奋，战斗意志格外昂扬。驻守在福建前线的陆海空三军许多部队的指战员，听完广播，立即带着坚决听毛主席的话，坚定不移地支持无产阶级革命派的决心书和保证书，汇成一股股洪流，奔向部队领导机关表示决心。驻浙江空军某部指战员、西藏军区直属机关的指战员们，激动得高举毛主席巨幅画像，唱着《大海航行靠舵手》，雄赳赳、气昂昂地聚集在一起，分别举行了隆重的誓师大会。在西藏军区直属机关的誓师大会上，指战员们齐声朗读毛主席语录：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”指战员们坚定地向毛主席宣誓：最最坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的指示，坚定地站在无产阶级革命造反派一边。为了支持革命造反派的夺权斗争，刀山敢上，火海敢闯！天塌下来顶得住，地陷下去填平它。
    广州、成都、兰州等部队和新疆、内蒙古、西藏军区许多指战员，热烈地欢呼无产阶级革命造反派在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下实行大联合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子展开全面夺权斗争的大好形势，他们在学习讨论《解放军报》社论的时候，重温了毛主席关于人民军队性质的论述，更加深刻地认识到，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，是人民解放军的最大政治任务。从毛主席亲手缔造红军的那一天起，我们军队就是最坚定不移地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，坚决支持无产阶级革命派的一切革命行动。铁道兵某部连续六年被评为四好连队的九连指战员说，毛主席教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。”我们人民军队从扛枪杆的第一天起，想的，说的，干的，就是夺权。为无产阶级夺权，为共产主义夺权。夺权就是我们的政治任务。在毛主席的英明领导下，我们经过几十年的流血牺牲，夺得了政权。但是，阶级敌人是不甘心死亡的。他们混进党内，篡夺了一些地方和一些部门的领导权，妄想在中国实现资本主义复辟。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派实现大联合，以排山倒海之势，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子展开全面的夺权大搏斗，把大权夺回到无产阶级革命派的手里。这是关系到我们国家千秋万代永远革命、永不变色的大事，是无产阶级的最大政治。我们和无产阶级革命派是亲如骨肉的阶级兄弟。我们面对着共同的敌人，我们有共同的革命目标。我们就是要满腔热忱地、毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持他们起来夺权。即使他们暂时是少数，我们也是毫不犹豫地支持他们。北京部队某部警卫连战士们说，全心全意为人民服务，是人民军队的本色。为无产阶级夺取政权和保卫政权，就是最大的为人民服务。是不是最坚决地支持无产阶级革命派，是衡量我们是否“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的标志。今天，在这场激烈的阶级斗争中，我们就要以“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神，坚决执行毛主席的指示，最坚决地支持无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争。蔡永祥生前所在的南京部队某连干部、战士们说，毛主席教导我们：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”在这场全国全面的阶级斗争中，每一个人都要经受严峻的考验，不是站在革命人民方面，就是站在革命人民的反面，中间道路是没有的。所谓军队“不介入”，完全是胡说八道。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，具有最鲜明的阶级立场，我们最爱无产阶级革命派，最坚决地支持革命造反派。我们一定像蔡永祥同志那样用生命保卫无产阶级文化大革命，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。
    许多部队指战员在座谈讨论时还坚定地表示，人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，毛主席发给我们的枪杆子，是用来保卫无产阶级司令部的，是用来保卫人民利益、保卫无产阶级专政的。我们坚决紧握手中枪，坚决支持无产阶级革命造反派的夺权斗争，保卫无产阶级革命造反派的夺权斗争。我们时刻警惕地注视着阶级敌人的任何阴谋诡计和破坏活动。我们严厉警告那些走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，只准无产阶级革命派夺权，不许你们阴谋变天。谁胆敢破坏无产阶级文化大革命，进行反革命活动，我们就坚决对他们实行无产阶级专政，坚决镇压，把他们彻底消灭！（附图片）
    一月二十五日，《解放军报》发表的社论《人民解放军坚决支持无产阶级革命派》一传到机场，空军某部飞行员立即组织学习讨论。他们一致表示积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，最坚决地支持和援助无产阶级革命派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
