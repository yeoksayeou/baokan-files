Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests U.S., South Vietnam, and Thailand's Border Violations
Demands U.S. Government Immediately Cease Aggressive Acts, Fully Compensate Victims

	PHNOM PENH, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) - According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on January 20, Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent two notes to the U.S. government on January 14 and 18 through the French Embassy in Phnom Penh. The notes protested the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet army's multiple shootings of peaceful Cambodian civilians in the border areas of the province of Takeo on November 9, 1966, and the shelling of Takeo province on January 4, which resulted in the deaths of one Cambodian woman and injuries to another.

	The notes stated: "The Royal Government strongly protests against the barbaric acts of aggression committed by the U.S.-South Vietnamese forces against unarmed Cambodian civilians and demands that the U.S. government immediately cease these acts and provide full compensation to the victims."

	Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sent these two protest notes to the South Vietnamese puppet government through the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh.

	Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously sent a note to the South Vietnamese puppet government on January 13, protesting the South Vietnamese puppet army's deliberate invasion of Takeo province on December 14, 1966, and their subsequent looting.

	The news agency also reported that on January 14, Cambodia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a protest to the Thai government regarding the Thai reactionary army's planting of landmines in Cambodian territory, which resulted in the deaths of three Cambodians and injuries to two others on January 8 and 9.

　　柬外交部抗议美国南越和泰国侵犯边境
　　要求美国政府立即停止侵略罪行，给受害者充分赔偿
    新华社金边二十日电 据柬埔寨新闻社二十日报道，柬埔寨外交部一月十四日和十八日通过法国驻金边大使馆向美国政府提出了两份照会，抗议美国—南越伪军一九六六年十一月九日，多次射击干丹省边境地区的柬埔寨和平居民，和一月四日炮击柬埔寨干丹省，打死、打伤柬埔寨妇女各一名的罪行。
    照会说：“王国政府对美国—南越军队对手无寸铁的柬埔寨和平村民蓄意犯下的野蛮侵略罪行提出强烈抗议，并且要求美国政府立即停止这种罪行和给予受害者以充分的赔偿。”
    柬埔寨外交部也把这两份抗议照会通过澳大利亚驻金边大使馆交给了南越傀儡政府。
    柬埔寨外交部曾经在一月十三日照会南越傀儡政府，抗议南越伪军去年十二月十四日蓄意侵犯柬埔寨干丹省，并且进行抢劫的强盗行径。
    这家新闻社还报道，柬埔寨外交部十四日就泰国反动军队在柬埔寨境内埋设地雷于一月八日和九日造成三名柬埔寨人被炸死，两人被炸伤一事，向泰国政府提出了抗议。
