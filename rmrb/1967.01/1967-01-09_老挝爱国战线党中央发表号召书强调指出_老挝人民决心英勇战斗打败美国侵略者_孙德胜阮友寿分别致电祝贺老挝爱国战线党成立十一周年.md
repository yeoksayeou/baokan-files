The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a call to arms, emphasizing that the Lao people are determined to fight bravely to defeat the American aggressors. Sun De-sheng and Nguyen Huu Tho sent separate telegrams to congratulate the Lao Patriotic Front on its eleventh anniversary.

KANGAI, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao Radio on Jan. 6, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a call to arms on the occasion of the eleventh anniversary of the Lao Patriotic Front (Jan. 6), calling on the Lao people to strengthen their unity, fight bravely, and achieve a thorough victory over the American aggressors, seizing greater victories.

The call to arms said that in the eleven years since the founding of the Lao Patriotic Front, the U.S. imperialists have continuously interfered with and invaded Laos, and the Lao traitor clique has shamefully betrayed and surrendered. At the same time, it has been eleven years of heroic revolutionary struggle for the Lao people, overcoming countless difficulties and hardships, making every sacrifice, and achieving brilliant victories.

The call to arms said that in the past eleven years, the Lao military and people have achieved increasingly great victories. In 1966 alone, they annihilated and disbanded about 10,000 enemy troops, shot down 196 American aggressor planes, and damaged hundreds more. The liberated areas have been continuously consolidated and expanded. The Lao people are fighting stronger than ever. On the contrary, the more the U.S. imperialists intensify their aggression against Laos, the more they suffer military defeats and political isolation.

The call to arms pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys will continue to play many vicious tricks and intensify new military adventures. The call to arms called on the Lao military and people to heighten their vigilance, closely watch the enemy's every trick, actively organize forces, and be ready for battle at any time, in coordination with the brotherly peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, to smash the enemy's every plot to expand the war.

The call to arms emphasized, "As long as there are invaders on our soil, our military and people will continue to hold their weapons and fight, no matter how great the sacrifices or how long the time, we are determined to fight to the end."

The call to arms also called on compatriots of all strata in the areas temporarily controlled by the Americans and their lackeys to strengthen their unity and resolutely fight against the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, Jan. 8 - According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Chairman Sun De-sheng, sent a telegram on Jan. 5 to Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, warmly congratulating the Lao Patriotic Front on its eleventh anniversary and the brilliant victories achieved by the Lao people in the past eleven years under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front.

The telegram pointed out that in recent years, the U.S. imperialists have blatantly waged "special warfare" in Laos, attempting to turn Laos into a new type of colony and military base. However, the heroic Lao military and people, under the wise leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, have closely united and fought bravely, achieving brilliant victories, liberating two-thirds of the country's land and half of its population. The prestige of the Lao Patriotic Front at home and abroad has been increasingly enhanced.

The telegram said that the Vietnamese people fully support the just struggle of the Lao people to oppose the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys and to build a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, Jan. 8 - According to a report by the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam sent a telegram on Jan. 6 to Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, warmly congratulating the Lao Patriotic Front on its eleventh anniversary.

In his telegram, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho condemned the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Laos and exposed the U.S. aggressors' current frenzied preparations to send troops to Laos.

He warmly congratulated the Lao people on their great achievements in all fields over the past eleven years and expressed his belief that, under the wise leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front and with the strong support of the progressive people of the world, the Lao people will certainly achieve brilliant victories and build a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos.

    老挝爱国战线党中央发表号召书强调指出
    老挝人民决心英勇战斗打败美国侵略者
    孙德胜阮友寿分别致电祝贺老挝爱国战线党成立十一周年
    新华社康开八日电  据巴特寮电台六日广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会在老挝爱国战线党成立十一周年（一月六日）的时候，发表号召书，号召老挝全国人民加强团结，英勇战斗，彻底战胜美国侵略强盗，夺取更大的胜利。
    号召书说，老挝爱国战线党成立以来的十一年，是美帝国主义对老挝不断进行干涉和侵略的十一年，是老挝卖国走狗集团进行可耻的背叛和投降的十一年；同时也是老挝人民进行英勇的革命斗争，克服千难万苦，不惜一切牺牲，取得了辉煌胜利的十一年。
    号召书说，十一年来，老挝军民取得了越来越大的胜利。仅在一九六六年，他们就消灭和瓦解敌人约一万名，击落美国强盗飞机一百九十六架，击伤数百架。解放区不断得到巩固和扩大。老挝人民越战越强。相反，美帝国主义越加强对老挝的侵略战争，就越遭到军事上的惨败和政治上的孤立。
    号召书指出，美帝国主义及其走狗还会玩弄许多恶毒的阴谋，加紧进行新的军事冒险。号召书号召老挝军民提高警惕，严密注视敌人的一切阴谋，积极组织力量和随时作好战斗的准备，配合兄弟的越南人民、柬埔寨人民和泰国人民，粉碎敌人的一切扩大战争的阴谋。
    号召书强调指出，“什么时候在我们国土上还有侵略者，我国军民就仍然要紧握手中的武器，继续进行战斗，不管要作出多大的牺牲，时间要拖长多久，也决心进行到底。”
    号召书还号召美国及其走狗暂时控制地区的各阶层同胞加强团结，坚决进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争。
    据新华社河内八日电据越南通讯社报道：越南祖国战线中央委员会主席团主席孙德胜，五日打电报给老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王，热烈祝贺老挝爱国战线党成立十一周年，祝贺老挝人民十一年来在老挝爱国战线党领导下取得的辉煌胜利。
    电报指出，近年来，美帝国主义明目张胆地在老挝进行“特种战争”，妄图把老挝变成它的新型殖民地和军事基地。但是，英雄的老挝军民，在老挝爱国战线党的英明领导下，紧密团结，英勇战斗，取得了光辉的胜利，解放了全国三分之二的土地和二分之一的人口。老挝爱国战线党在国内和国际上的威望日益提高。
    电报中说，越南人民彻底支持老挝人民为反对美帝国主义及其走狗，为建立一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝而进行的正义斗争。
    新华社河内八日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿六日打电报给老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王，热烈祝贺老挝爱国战线党成立十一周年。
    阮友寿主席在电报中谴责美帝国主义侵略老挝的罪行，揭穿了美国侵略者目前正疯狂地准备派遣军队到老挝的阴谋。
    他热烈祝贺老挝人民十一年来在各方面取得的巨大成就，并且表示深信，在老挝爱国战线党的英明领导下和全世界进步人民的有力支持下，老挝人民必将取得光辉的胜利，建立一个和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝。
