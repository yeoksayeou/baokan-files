In the Lanzhou Refinery's vacuum distillation workshop, there is a "Red Girls" pump room. Four young women manage the crisscrossing process pipes meticulously, keeping everything spotless and orderly. Each piece of equipment is marked with a "Five Good" sign.

In the past, people often said, "Pump operators never leave their five essentials: a rag for wiping, a broom for sweeping, a wrench for tightening, an oil can for oiling, and complete records without any mistakes." Now, the "Red Girls" say, "'The Three Articles' are the essentials; pump operators can never be without them."

Shift leader Deng Xiuying joined the factory in 1964. Seeing the old workers constantly wiping pumps and sweeping the floor, she thought, "Are we oil refinery workers or janitors?" She feared she wouldn't learn any skills and considered quitting. The leadership and old workers explained to her that "monitoring pumps and maintaining cleanliness is also part of the revolution," but she couldn't see it that way. Later, the factory launched a campaign to study Chairman Mao's works. She studied "The Three Articles" and felt more and more that her thoughts were wrong. The more she studied, the more she loved her job. Afterwards, she constantly compared herself to the shining examples of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and Old Man Carving Mountains, inspiring and demanding more from herself, and making great progress in her work.

"I listen to Chairman Mao's words, and the pumps listen to mine." The "Red Girls" treat Chairman Mao's book as the sharpest weapon to tame the machinery. In the "Red Girls" pump room's shift handover diary, you can see everywhere the words, "Our responsibility is to the people." These are not just ordinary words; they are the shining rays of Mao Zedong Thought, the highest command guiding their battles.

One day, Li Xiufen was on duty. One pump was running abnormally and stopped suddenly. She checked multiple times and found water in the filter screen. Based on past experience, if there is water in the filter screen, there would also be water in the oil tank. Should she change the oil in the oil tank? It was almost time to go off duty; if she didn't change it, the next shift might not find the problem, and the machinery would be damaged! "Our responsibility is to the people." Chairman Mao's teaching suddenly came to Li Xiufen's mind. She immediately cleaned the water from the filter screen, replaced the oil in the oil tank, solved the problem, and then went off duty with a clear conscience.

The "Red Girls" always keep "The Three Articles" as their guiding principles, fighting against selfish thoughts and various incorrect ideas. They changed their shift handover diaries, which used to only record flow rate, temperature, and pressure, to include their thoughts and insights on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Every word and sentence shines with the light of Mao Zedong Thought. The shift handover diary has become a true record of their revolution in the depths of their souls, using "The Three Articles" as their weapon.

As their thoughts changed, the appearance of the pump room also changed; the girls who once knew little became red "oil soldiers," and the pump room became a red flag for the entire factory to learn from. The "Red Girls" deeply felt, "'The Three Articles' are the essentials. Studying them opens your mind. Writing shift handover diaries with insights, looking in the mirror every day. Breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, studying and applying actively and effectively."

    “红姑娘”离不开“老三篇”
    周征云
    在兰州炼油厂常减压车间，有一个“红姑娘”泵房。四个姑娘把纵横交错的工艺管线，管理得井井有条，一尘不染，台台设备，都插上了“五好”标志。
    过去，人们常说：“司泵工不离五法宝，抹布抹，扫把扫，扳手紧，油壶浇，记录齐全不了草。”而现在，“红姑娘”们却说：“‘老三篇’是法宝，泵工时时离不了。”
    岗长邓秀英，一九六四年进厂时，看到老工人整天不是擦泵就是拖地，心想：
  “我们是炼油工，还是清洁工？”她怕学不到技术，想干脆不干了。领导上和老工人们给她讲了不少“看泵，搞卫生，也是干革命”的道理，她总是转不过弯来。后来，厂里掀起了学习毛主席著作的高潮，她学习了“老三篇”，越学越感到自己的思想不对头，越学越热爱自己的岗位。以后，她时时事事以张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个人的光辉形象对照自己，激励自己，要求自己，工作上大有进步。
      “我听毛主席的话，机泵就听我的话”。“红姑娘”们把毛主席的书当作驯服机泵的最锐利的武器。在“红姑娘”泵房的交接班日记里，处处都可以看到“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”这不是几个普通的字，这是金光闪闪的毛泽东思想，是指挥她们战斗的最高命令。
    一天，李秀凤值班，有一台泵运转不正常，转着转着就停下了。她多次检查，发现过滤网内积了水。根据以往的经验，过滤网有水，油箱也会有水。换掉油箱的油吧，眼看就要下班了；不换，下一班的同志要是检查不出来，不就会对机泵有磨损吗！“我们的责任，是向人民负责。”毛主席的教导顿时浮现在李秀凤的脑中。她马上动手清理了过滤网内的积水，更换了油箱的油，问题解决了，才放心下了班。
    “红姑娘”们时时刻刻把“老三篇”作为座右铭，同私心杂念斗，同各种错误思想斗。她们把过去只写流量、温度、压力的交接班日记，增加了活学活用毛主席著作的心得、体会，字里行间都闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。交接班日记变成了她们以“老三篇”为武器，在灵魂深处闹革命的真实记录。
    人的思想变了，泵房的面貌也在变；原来知识很少的“毛丫头”变成了红色的“输油兵”，泵房也成了全厂学习的一面红旗。“红姑娘”们深有体会地说：“老三篇”是法宝，学了思想就开窍。交接日记写心得，对着“镜子”天天照。破私立公闹革命，活学活用结合好。
