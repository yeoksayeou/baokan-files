Peking University's revolutionary teachers, students, and staff resolutely support the Central Committee's telegram and resolutely back the Shanghai revolutionary rebels. They enthusiastically acclaim the new victory of the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. They are determined to unite with revolutionary rebels across the country and fight to the end.

Revolutionary teachers and students march into factories and mines, vigorously promoting Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production." They mobilize the broad revolutionary masses to rise up against economism and smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, seizing new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated the 16th, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University, who posted the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country, have in recent days enthusiastically acclaimed the Marxist-Leninism big-character poster broadcast by our great leader Chairman Mao—"A Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and "Urgent Announcement" by various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai. They resolutely support and respond to the telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, as well as the editorials in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine.

On the 9th, after the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast "A Letter to All the People of Shanghai," the Cultural Revolution Committee of Peking University immediately sent a telegram full of fighting comradeship to various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai. Many revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, filled with the joy of victory, expressed warm congratulations to comrades from the Revolutionary Committee of Higher Education Institutions in Shanghai and the Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee of East China Normal University's liaison station in Beijing.

On the evening of the 11th, news came of the "Urgent Announcement" by the Shanghai revolutionary rebels and the telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, as well as the editorial published in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine on January 12th. The revolutionary teachers and students of North Peking were filled with enthusiasm, and their hearts surged with waves. At 11 p.m., the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao, beating drums and gongs, held a "Resolutely Support the Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels, Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" rally. At the meeting, the chairman of the Cultural Revolution Committee of Peking University, Nie Yuanzi, issued a battle call to all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff: "Comrades loyal to Mao Zedong Thought! The time has come! Let us take immediate action to warn those few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line to stop at the brink of the precipice. If they do not surrender, let them perish!"

Amid thunderous applause, the meeting passed a letter of tribute to our great leader Chairman Mao, expressing their boundless love, loyalty, admiration, and faith in Chairman Mao. The letter said: "Most respected leader Chairman Mao, at every critical moment of struggle, we have received your resolute support. Today, you have issued a great call to launch a general offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line. We, the revolutionary teachers and students, declare to you: We will resolutely support the revolutionary actions of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, and we will unshakably unite with the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai and the revolutionary rebels across the country, fight together, and win together."

That night, many revolutionary teachers, students, and staff stayed up all night. Some printed leaflets, some wrote poems and painted, criticizing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and praising the new victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. A poem reads: "The waters of Zhongnanhai connect with the tides of Huangpu; Chairman Mao supports the revolutionary rebels; Great leader Chairman Mao! You personally decided to publish another Marxist-Leninism big-character poster; Your warm concern and great call have launched a new high tide in the cultural revolution."

In recent days, some revolutionary teachers and students of Peking University have excitedly recalled the scenes of fighting side by side with the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, and compared them with the current great situation of the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai. They have been greatly inspired and their fighting spirit has soared.

On June 1st last year, Chairman Mao personally decided to publish the first Marxist-Leninism big-character poster in the country from Peking University, igniting the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and launching a mass movement with the focus on striking down the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. However, those who formulated and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, besieged the revolutionary leftists, suppressed different opinions, and carried out white terror. They thought they were successful, boosting the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and suppressing the spirit of the proletariat. At that time, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai strongly supported the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University. Since August last year, many revolutionary teachers and students from revolutionary organizations such as the New Peking University Defense Mao Zedong Thought Combat Team have gone to Shanghai for revolutionary linkage, fighting side by side with the Shanghai revolutionary rebels against the handful of power-holders within the Party in the Shanghai region who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn individuals who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," labored and fought together with the workers and peasants, forging a close fighting friendship.

Inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Peking University are now investing in the new revolutionary high tide with even greater revolutionary enthusiasm. In recent days, the revolutionary teachers and students, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and quotation boards, waving red flags, braving the cold wind, have marched into factories and mines. Through oral propaganda and distributing revolutionary leaflets, they have vigorously promoted Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," mobilizing the broad revolutionary masses to rise up against economism, smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and seize new victories in the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary workers responsible for the school's logistics have responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production" with practical actions. While actively participating in the Cultural Revolution movement, they have insisted on working and production posts, ensuring that the Cultural Revolution movement in the school is carried out better.

    北京大学革命师生员工坚决拥护中央贺电坚决支持上海革命造反派
    热烈欢呼毛主席为代表的革命路线新胜利
    决心和全国革命造反派团结一起战斗到底
    革命师生走向工矿企业，深入宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，动员广大革命群众起来反对经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，夺取文化大革命的新胜利。
    据新华社十六日讯贴出全国第一张马列主义大字报的北京大学的革命师生员工，连日来，最最热烈地欢呼我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定广播的又一张马列主义大字报——上海各革命群众组织的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，最最坚决地拥护和响应中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电，以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志社论。
    九日，中央人民广播电台广播《告上海全市人民书》后，北京大学文化革命委员会就向上海各革命群众组织发出了充满战斗友情的致敬电。许多革命师生员工满怀胜利的喜悦，向红卫兵上海市大专院校革命委员会和华东师范大学文化革命筹委会驻京联络站的战友们表示热烈祝贺。
    十一日晚间，又传来了上海革命造反派《紧急通告》和中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海各革命造反团体的贺电，以及《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志一月十二日的社论发表的喜讯，北大革命师生员工激情满胸怀，心潮逐浪高。深夜十一时，革命师生员工们，高举着毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，擂起鼓，敲起锣，举行了“坚决支持上海革命造反派，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑誓师大会”。会上，北京大学文化革命委员会主任聂元梓向全校革命师生员工发出了战斗号召：“忠于毛泽东思想的战友们！是时候了！让我们立即行动起来，警告那些极少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，赶快悬崖勒马。如果不投降，就叫他灭亡！”
    在暴风雨般的掌声中，大会通过了给我们的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬信，表达了他们对毛主席的无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限崇拜、无限信仰的心情。信中说：“最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，在每一个斗争的紧要关头，我们都得到了您的坚决支持。今天，您又发出了向资产阶级反动路线发动总攻击的伟大号召。我们全体革命师生向您表示：一定坚决支持上海革命造反派的革命行动，坚定不移地和上海的革命造反派、全国的革命造反派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”
    这天晚上，许多革命师生员工，彻夜不眠。有的人刻印传单，有的人写诗作画，痛击资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，歌颂以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的新胜利。一首诗中写道：“中南海的水连着黄浦潮，毛主席给革命造反派撑腰；伟大的领袖毛主席！您亲自决定发表了又一张马列主义大字报；亲切的关怀、伟大的号召，文化革命掀起了新高潮。”
    这几天，北大的一些革命师生兴奋地回忆着与上海革命造反派并肩战斗情景，对照今天上海文化大革命的大好形势，受到极大鼓舞，斗志更加昂扬。
    去年六月一日，毛主席亲自决定发表北京大学的全国第一张马列主义大字报，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，掀起了一个以打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为重点的群众运动。但是，那些制定和执行资产阶级反动路线的人，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命左派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气。那时，上海的革命群众大力支持了北京大学的革命师生员工。去年八月以来，新北大捍卫毛泽东思想战斗团等革命组织的许多革命师生到上海进行革命串连，同上海革命造反派一起，向上海地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，进行了坚决的斗争。他们牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，与工农群众共同劳动，并肩战斗，结下了亲密的战斗友谊。
    在上海革命造反派革命精神的鼓舞下，北京大学的革命师生员工正以更大的革命热情投入到新的革命高潮中去。革命师生们连日来擎着毛主席像和语录牌，高举红旗，冒着寒风，走向工矿企业，通过口头宣传、散发革命传单，深入宣传毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，动员广大革命群众起来，反对经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，夺取文化大革命的新胜利。负责学校后勤工作的革命职工们，以实际行动响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，一面积极参加文化大革命运动，一面坚持工作和生产岗位，保证学校的文化大革命运动更好地开展。
