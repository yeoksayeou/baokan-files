	Opposing Imperialism Means Opposing Revisionism

	There is an old saying: "Birds of a feather flock together, and people of the same kind gather in groups."

	Those who stand on the side of the revolutionary people are revolutionaries; those who stand on the side of imperialism and reactionaries are counter-revolutionaries.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, the biggest traitor to the international communist movement, and the saboteur of the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In a word, they are thorough counter-revolutionaries.

	In India, they spared no expense and generously funded the Indian reactionaries to act as the vanguard in opposing China.

	In Indonesia, they fraternized with the fascist military regime that massacred revolutionary people.

	In the Congo (Leopoldville), they participated in the assassination of Lumumba in the past, and today they are openly colluding with the executioner of Lumumba, Mobutu.

	In the United Nations and throughout the world, they more brazenly implement the counter-revolutionary global strategy of U.S.-Soviet collaboration to dominate the world.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership clique operates more covertly and cunningly than U.S. imperialism. They appear to be human on the surface but are ghosts underneath. They have played a role that U.S. imperialism could not.

	However, once you engage in counter-revolutionary activities, you cannot hide your counter-revolutionary face. Ironclad facts and bloody lessons have made the people of the world increasingly see through the accomplice nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique and increasingly understand the necessity of opposing imperialism by opposing revisionism.

	Chairman Mao has issued a great call: "All the revolutionary people of the world, unite! Beat down imperialism, beat down modern revisionism, beat down all reactionaries!" Under this call, the people of various countries are taking action and intensifying their struggle. They will definitely sweep away all harmful elements and build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without exploitation.

    反帝必须反修
    俗话说：物以类聚，人以群分。
    什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派；什么人站在帝国主义和反动派方面，他就是反革命派。
    苏修领导集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶，国际共产主义运动的大叛徒，亚非拉民族解放运动的破坏者。一句话，是十足的反革命派。
    在印度，他们不惜工本，慷慨解囊，让印度反动派充当反华急先锋。
    在印度尼西亚，他们跟血腥屠杀革命人民的法西斯军人政权打得火热。
    在刚果（利），他们过去参与了对卢蒙巴的谋杀，今天又要同杀害卢蒙巴的刽子手蒙博托公开勾搭。
    在联合国，在全世界，他们更明目张胆地推行美苏合作主宰世界的反革命全球战略。
    苏修领导集团干得比美帝国主义更隐蔽，更狡猾。他们表面是人，暗中是鬼，他们起了美帝国主义所起不了的作用。
    但是，既要干反革命的勾当，就不可能掩盖反革命的面目。铁的事实，血的教训，使全世界人民越来越看清了苏修领导集团的帮凶面目，越来越明白反帝必须反修的道理。
    毛主席发出了伟大的号召：“全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。”在这个号召下，各国人民正在行动起来，加紧战斗，一定要扫除一切害人虫，建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。
