The revolutionary actions of the great alliance and rebellion of the revolutionary rebels in our country have received enthusiastic praise and firm support from the heroic Albanian people.

In recent days, from the shores of the Adriatic Sea, the warm and heartfelt cheers of Albanian comrades have been continuously heard. Albanian comrades visiting our country have, with fiery enthusiasm, praised the brilliant achievements of our country's revolutionary rebels.

The support from our Albanian brothers has moved us, inspired us, and invigorated us!

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The hearts of the Chinese and Albanian peoples, though separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, are united. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades.... Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests." The firm support of the Albanian people for our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and their enthusiastic praise for our country's revolutionary rebels, once again fully prove that the revolutionary friendship between the Chinese and Albanian parties and peoples is a model of proletarian internationalism.

The Albanian people support our country's revolutionary rebels so enthusiastically because they are thorough revolutionaries of the proletariat.

Under the leadership of the Party of Labour of Albania headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people have raised high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and stood at the forefront of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. They are fearless of pressure, fearless of coercion, fearless of ghosts, and fearless of demons, displaying the spirit of proletarian backbone. They are a strong shock troop in the international communist movement.

We must be revolutionary rebels at home and also revolutionary rebels internationally.

All revolutionary rebels of the world, unite! Let's rebel against imperialism, rebel against modern revisionism, and rebel against the reactionaries of all countries! Let's smash the old world to smithereens and create a new world bathed in the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought!

　　中阿两国人民心连心
    我国革命造反派大联合、大造反的革命行动，得到了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的热烈赞扬和坚决支持。
    连日来，从亚得里亚海畔，不断传来阿尔巴尼亚同志们亲切的衷心的欢呼声。正在我国访问的阿尔巴尼亚战友们，以火一般热情的语言，赞扬了我国革命造反派取得的辉煌战果。
    阿尔巴尼亚兄弟的支持，使我们感动，使我们鼓舞，使我们振奋！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。……我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”阿尔巴尼亚人民对于我国无产阶级文化大革命的坚决支持，对于我国革命造反派的热情赞扬，再一次充分证明：中阿两党和两国人民的革命友谊，是无产阶级国际主义的典范。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民这样热烈地支持我国革命造反派，因为他们是无产阶级的彻底革命派。
    在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党领导下，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民高举马克思列宁主义大旗，站在反帝反修的最前线。他们不怕压，不怕迫，不怕鬼，不怕魅，表现了无产阶级的硬骨头精神。他们是国际共产主义运动中的一支坚强的突击队。
    我们要当国内的革命造反派，也要当国际的革命造反派。
    全世界革命造反派联合起来，大造帝国主义的反，大造现代修正主义的反，大造各国反动派的反！把旧世界打得天翻地覆，砸个稀巴烂，创造一个毛泽东思想阳光普照的红彤彤的新世界！
