The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Foreign Cultural Liaison Committee held a gala tonight to welcome the Romanian military song and dance troupe led by Colonel Apostol Emil and Colonel Dinu Stelian, and the Romanian performing arts group led by George Burlor, to celebrate the arrival of 1967.

Leaders from the central government and various sectors, including Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Xiao Hua, Peng Shaohui, Yuan Ziqing, Qiao Guanhua, and Song Yiping, attended the gala.

The acting charge d'affaires of the Romanian Embassy in China, Istrati, was also invited to attend the gala.

As the new year arrived, the entire audience stood up and sang "The East is Red" enthusiastically, wishing our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao a long life!

Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, and other comrades, along with the Chinese and Romanian comrades in the audience, raised their glasses and toasted to the new year, wishing for the continuous development of friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Romania.

Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Yuan Ziqing, spoke at the gala. He said, "At this moment, when our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is achieving great victories, the friendly envoys of the Romanian people and army—the Romanian People's Republic Military Song and Dance Troupe and the Performing Arts Group—are visiting and performing in our country. The visit and performance by the Romanian artists have left a deep impression on the broad masses of the Chinese people and the soldiers and officers of the PLA. This has made new contributions to promoting cultural exchanges between China and Romania, strengthening mutual understanding, and enhancing the friendship between the peoples and armies of the two countries."

Yuan Ziqing said, "The peoples and armies of China and Romania have established deep friendships through long-term revolutionary struggles. In the future, in the common cause of building socialism, in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and reactionaries in various countries, and against hegemonism, to achieve world peace, national liberation, people's democracy, and socialism, we will continue to consolidate and develop the friendly cooperative relations between the peoples and armies of China and Romania."

Colonel Apostol Emil, the leader of the Romanian military song and dance troupe, said in his speech, "Our visit and performance in China have been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and the soldiers and officers of the PLA. This visit and performance have contributed to consolidating and developing the friendship between the peoples and armies of Romania and China."

In the gala filled with warm and friendly atmosphere, artists from China and Romania performed wonderful musical and dance programs, continuing until the arrival of the new year.
