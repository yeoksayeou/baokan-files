"The trees in frost are red and brilliant, the heavenly soldiers' rage pierces the heavens." A great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary masses is unfolding across the nation to seize power from those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road! The army of the proletarian revolutionaries is rolling like a torrent, its power is irresistible, sweeping all before it!

The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. With power, one has everything. Without power, one has nothing. This is the great truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Looking back over the past few months, those stubborn representatives of the bourgeoisie, holding power in their hands, have surrounded and attacked the revolutionary masses, imposing white terror. But the brave revolutionary rebels are unyielding and fearless. They have made up their minds, are ready to sacrifice everything, overcome all difficulties, and unite into a vast revolutionary army to seize power from those in authority who are taking the capitalist road, to take back all Party power, state power, and economic power! Look, the proletarian revolutionaries are full of vigor and have achieved brilliant victories, truly a great cause for rejoicing!

Our country is the country of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our state is the state of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our society is a society where the workers, peasants, and soldiers are masters. In the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army cannot but intervene. The People's Liberation Army is the revolutionary army of the proletariat, the children of the people. The People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary rebels are heart to heart. The People's Liberation Army is forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought. The People's Liberation Army and the workers and peasants form an iron wall to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whoever dares to violate the dictatorship of the proletariat and sabotage the Cultural Revolution, we will smash them to smithereens!

We, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, love Chairman Mao the most, and we listen to Chairman Mao the most. We firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, and firmly support and assist the proletarian revolutionaries.

Dear comrades-in-arms: We will definitely give you our full support. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we will grasp our rifles firmly and resolutely fight shoulder to shoulder with you until we achieve the final victory!

    解放军和革命造反派结成铜墙铁壁
　　解放军艺术学院星火燎原革命造反队
      “万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉。”一场无产阶级革命派大联合，向党内走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的大战在全国范围内展开了！无产阶级革命派的大军，如洪流滚滚，其威力锐不可挡，所向披靡！
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权，就有了一切。没有政权，就没有一切。这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大真理。回想几个月来，那些顽固的资产阶级代表人物手里掌着权，他们对革命派围攻、打击，实行白色恐怖。但是，勇敢的革命造反者，是压不垮、吓不倒的。他们下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，联合成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，从走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺权，把一切党权、政权、财权统统夺回来！看，无产阶级革命派，意气风发，战绩辉煌，真是大快人心！
    我们的天下，是工农兵的天下。我们的国家，是工农兵的国家。我们的社会，是工农兵作主人的社会。在当前无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，人民解放军是不能不介入的。人民解放军是无产阶级的革命军队，是人民的子弟兵。解放军和革命造反派心连心。人民解放军永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想。解放军和工农大众结成保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级专政的铜墙铁壁。谁敢触犯无产阶级专政，破坏文化大革命，我们就立刻把他砸个稀巴烂！
    我们人民解放军战士，最最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话。我们坚决响应毛主席的号召，坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，坚决支持和援助无产阶级革命派。
    亲爱的战友们：我们一定全力支持你们。在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，我们紧握钢枪，坚决和你们并肩战斗，直到夺取最后的胜利！
