Palestinian revolutionary fighters, who are struggling to return to their homeland, eagerly hope to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. They are thirsty for the truth from Chairman Mao's works. When they obtain Chairman Mao's works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they actively study them.

Once, a Palestinian revolutionary fighter said in a conversation with a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Cairo: "The more I read Chairman Mao's books, the more I admire Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's brilliant judgments about imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers, about people's war, and about self-reliance, illuminate the path of revolutionary struggle for the people of the world and have great inspirational and motivational value for us. Chairman Mao is truly the great revolutionary leader and teacher of our time."

He turned to his comrades and loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," "Without an army of the people, there is nothing." He then pointed out: "These are eternal truths."

He added: "Now we have chosen armed struggle as the sole path to liberate our country. We have the People's Liberation Army. Imperialism and its running dog Israel are merely paper tigers. As long as we persist in the struggle and firmly rely on the people, we will definitely be victorious."

	Palestinian revolutionary fighters have an infinite love for Mao Zedong Thought. This is a soldier of the Palestine Liberation Army earnestly studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

    巴勒斯坦革命战士用毛泽东思想武装自己
    坚信“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理
    据新华社讯　正在为争取重返家园而斗争的巴勒斯坦革命战士们迫切希望用毛泽东思想来武装自己。他们如饥似渴地要从毛主席著作中寻找真理，当他们获得了毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》，就积极地进行学习。
    一位巴勒斯坦革命战士有一次在开罗同新华社记者谈话时说：“我越读毛主席的书，越钦佩毛主席。毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎、关于人民战争、关于自力更生的英明论断，照亮了世界人民的革命斗争道路，对我们有很大的启发作用和鼓舞作用。毛主席真是当代的伟大革命领袖和导师。”
    他转向他的战友们，高声朗读毛主席语录：“枪杆子里面出政权”，“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”他接着指出：“这是颠扑不破的真理。”
    他又说：“现在我们选择了武装斗争作为解放我们祖国的唯一道路，我们有了解放军。帝国主义和它的走狗以色列只不过是纸老虎。只要我们坚持斗争，坚决依靠人民，那么，我们就一定胜利。”
