Last August, on one day, a certain artillery unit of the People's Liberation Army had marched all night and was resting on a small hill. Several dozen cannons and several dozen trucks loaded with gasoline and shells were tightly packed together. Nearby villagers were enthusiastically welcoming the soldiers with cups of tea. Suddenly, a thick column of smoke shot up from among the trucks, and a truck loaded with shells burst into flames. A serious explosion seemed imminent.

Fire is the order. The assistant truck manager, Zhu Gangqiang, ran from several dozen meters away to the scene. Other comrades also rushed to put out the fire. Some used soil to smother the flames, and others used water to douse them. Dai Zhengang and Xiao Wenchi quickly jumped onto the truck to unload the shell boxes. But time was of the essence; the auxiliary fuel tank and the shells on the truck could explode at any moment! If an explosion occurred, several dozen trucks, several dozen cannons, and over a thousand comrades on the scene would all suffer unimaginable losses. The only solution was to quickly drive the truck out of the parking area. Doing so would be extremely dangerous. Instantly, Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated Zhu Gangqiang's mind: "To struggle is to sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence. 'We die for the people, and this is a worthy death.'"

Zhu Gangqiang's blood boiled, and he felt a surge of energy. He dashed onto the truck's cab. At that moment, the driver also rushed into the cab from the right door. Zhu Gangqiang said, "One person is enough," and forcefully pushed the driver out of the truck. To save time, he quickly turned the ignition, added fuel, stepped on the starter, and shifted gears. However, unexpectedly, the truck failed to start after two consecutive attempts. Time was ticking away, and the fire was burning more fiercely. Every second delayed increased the danger. At this critical moment, he heard Chairman Mao's voice again: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." Instantly, he was filled with confidence and strength, and he calmed down to continue stepping on the starter.

The truck quickly started. Zhu Gangqiang drove the truck away from the group of vehicles and headed towards a large pond in front. At that moment, he had only one thought: to sacrifice himself to protect the state's property and the safety of his comrades. He fearlessly stepped on the accelerator and drove the truck into the pond. The water submerged the truck, extinguishing the fire and preventing a serious explosion. Zhu Gangqiang was also rescued by his comrades.

What force enabled Zhu Gangqiang to face danger without fear and be ready to die? It was the great thought of Mao Zedong. He said: "To be invincible, one must be fearless, and to be fearless, one must be selfless." These few words expressed his deep loyalty to the revolutionary cause! For a long time, Zhu Gangqiang has followed Chairman Mao's teachings, diligently studied Chairman Mao's works, consciously transformed his thoughts, eliminated selfishness, and established a selfless worldview of the proletariat. "Selflessness leads to fearlessness" is Zhu Gangqiang's experience and the common motto of all heroes.

    无私才能无畏
    去年八月间的一天，炮兵某部经过一夜急行军，正在一个小山坡上休息。几十门火炮，几十辆装载汽油和炮弹的汽车，密集地排列在一起。附近的社员，正端着茶水热情地欢迎子弟兵。突然，车群中一股浓烟冲天而起，一辆满载炮弹的汽车猛地燃烧起来，一场严重的爆炸，眼看就要发生。
    火光就是命令。车管助理员朱刚强，从几十米外跑步赶到火场。别的同志也纷纷赶来救火。有的用土去扑打，有的用水浇泼。戴正昂、肖文池飞快跳上汽车，抢卸炮弹箱。但时间不等人，汽车的副油箱和车上的炮弹，随时都有爆炸的可能！一旦爆炸，几十辆车、几十门炮，在场的上千名阶级兄弟，都要遭到不堪设想的损失。唯一的办法，是尽快地把这台汽车开出车场。这样做，有着严重的生命危险。霎时，毛主席的教导像闪电一般照亮了朱刚强的思想：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。”“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”朱刚强顿时热血沸腾，浑身是劲，一个箭步冲上了汽车驾驶室。这时候，司机也从右门冲上了驾驶室。朱刚强说了句“有我一个就对付得了”，用力把司机推下了车。为了争取时间，他以最快的速度开电门，加油，踩马达，挂档。然而出乎意料，连续两次，都没有把车发动起来。时间一秒一秒地过去，烈火越烧越旺。多耽误一秒钟，就增加一分危险。在这千钧一发的紧急关头，他耳边又响起了毛主席的声音：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”顿时充满了信心和力量，他沉着下来，继续踩着马达。
    汽车很快发动了。朱刚强驾着汽车，迅速离开车群，向着前面的大水塘开去。这时，他只有一个信念：宁肯牺牲自己，也要保住国家财产和同志们的安全。他不顾一切地加大油门，把汽车开进了水塘。水淹没了汽车，火灭了，一场严重的爆炸避免了。朱刚强在同志们的抢救下，也脱了险。
    是什么力量使朱刚强临危不惧、视死如归？是伟大的毛泽东思想。他说：“无敌先要无畏，无畏全靠无私。”短短一句话，道出了他对革命事业的耿耿忠心！长期以来，朱刚强遵循毛主席的教导，努力学习毛主席著作，自觉地改造思想，破私立公，树立一心为公的无产阶级世界观。“无私才能无畏”，这是朱刚强的体会，也是所有英雄人物的共同格言。　（广宣）（附图片）
