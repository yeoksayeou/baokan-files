Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary rebels carry out great unity and resolutely seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 16th — The editorial article "The Proletarian Revolutionary Forces Should Unite" from the *Red Flag* magazine and the letter of salute to Chairman Mao from the rally of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, which vowed to "seize the revolution and promote production, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line," have once again brought great encouragement to the million-strong revolutionary rebel army of Shanghai, which is fearlessly launching a major counterattack against the bourgeois reactionary line. They feel very close and inspired, and are determined to put into practice the spirit of the editorial article from the *Red Flag* magazine, learn from the proletarian revolutionary spirit of the red rebels of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, and further carry out the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. They will unite all revolutionary forces, firmly grasp the political, economic, and cultural power of the proletariat, establish a new revolutionary order, adhere to the socialist direction, seize the revolution and promote production, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and advance along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, winning victory after victory, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. They are determined to achieve a double victory in revolution and production in 1967.

Since the revolutionary rebel workers took over the Shanghai North Station, the gateway to Shanghai, a new and vibrant scene has emerged. The platform is orderly, and the transportation on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines is smooth. This is a great victory achieved by the revolutionary rebel workers of the railway department, with the assistance of the Red Guards, who united the broad revolutionary staff, seized the revolution and promoted production, and thoroughly smashed the conspiracy of a handful of reactionaries to stop water, electricity, and transportation. A responsible person from the Shanghai Railway Revolutionary Rebel Workers' Joint Command Department said with deep feelings: Only by carrying out the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels can we seize the leadership from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly carry out the bourgeois reactionary line; only by carrying out the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary rebels can we consolidate the power we have seized and establish a new revolutionary order. The great unity of the revolutionary rebel workers is the great unity under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Only such a great unity can unify thoughts, unify command, unify steps, and bring out the greatest strength.

The revolutionary rebel workers fighting at the Shanghai Port, after reading the editorial article from the *Red Flag* magazine, unanimously agreed that the article is correct and well said. These revolutionary rebel workers have been holding high the banner of Chairman Mao's "seize the revolution and promote production" in recent days, daring to defy the adverse winds, take on heavy responsibilities, unite revolutionary workers, and wage a resolute struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line.

The revolutionary rebel workers at the Shanghai Port also pointed out: Seizing the leadership from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and those who stubbornly carry out the bourgeois reactionary line is only an initial victory. To consolidate this victory, we must definitely overthrow, expose, and smash these power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Otherwise, they will bite back like poisonous snakes, and the power will not be consolidated. To consolidate this victory, we must definitely ensure that the leadership is firmly in the hands of the genuine proletarian revolutionary leftists. We must raise our political vigilance and prevent bad elements from taking advantage of the chaos.

The members of the revolutionary rebel brigade headquarters of the People's Bank of China, Shanghai Branch, said: With the economic power in the hands of the revolutionary rebels, there will be no sabotage of the socialist financial system. Recently, six revolutionary rebel organizations in the city's banking system have united to seize the leadership of the banks, which control the economic lifeline of Shanghai, and truly put it in the hands of the revolutionary leftists.

The responsible person of the New Shipbuilding Factory Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Brigade said: After our factory's Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Brigade and eight other rebel organizations seized the leadership of the factory on January 13th, the revolutionary order is very good, and all production command systems are normal. Revolutionary masses reflected that this power is seized well. If we do not seize the power from these handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the enterprise will change color and go down the revisionist road. This responsible person said, "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We revolutionary rebels must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the overall direction, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

According to Xinhua News Agency, January 16th — The letter of salute to Chairman Mao from the rally of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, which vowed to "seize the revolution and promote production, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line," and the editorial article "The Proletarian Revolutionary Forces Should Unite" from the *Red Flag* magazine have sparked a strong response among the revolutionary rebels in the capital. Everyone enthusiastically responds to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, expressing their determination to learn well from the revolutionary experience of Shanghai's proletariat, carry out great unity under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and wage a head-on struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, firmly grasping the political, economic, and cultural power in their own hands.

The red rebels of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory, who wrote a letter of salute to our great leader Chairman Mao, and other revolutionary workers, when they learned that this letter was broadcast on the radio and published in the newspapers, were overjoyed, cheering and running to tell each other. The shout of "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed throughout the factory. The red rebel fighters and other revolutionary workers said: This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest support, and greatest encouragement for us. This is a great joy. We will definitely fulfill the pledge in the letter of salute to Chairman Mao, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's directive of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and strive for a double victory in revolution and production. We will definitely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, carry out the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces, seize the power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, overthrow, expose, and smash them. Tonight, many factories, schools, and offices in Beijing held rallies on "seizing the revolution and promoting production, and thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line." At the meetings, people were joyful and full of fighting spirit, showing the good situation and great strength of the revolutionary rebels uniting together.

The responsible persons of the Capital Workers' Red Rebel Liaison Station and the Capital Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters said: The experience of the Shanghai proletariat and other revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres uniting together, firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the few stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, has greatly inspired and helped us. We are determined to be like the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, with the proletarian revolutionary forces as the core, unite all revolutionary forces, and wage a comprehensive struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Some members of the Red Rebel Brigade of the Beijing Jianhua Foundry, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deeply felt that the proletarian revolutionary forces uniting together and seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the central task of the cultural revolution. We must break through the obstruction and sabotage of the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, take the Shanghai proletariat as an example, achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and give a resounding blow to the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!

Some fighters of the revolutionary rebel forces of the Beijing Glass Factory, who are counterattacking the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, said in a discussion today, "The slogan 'The Proletarian Revolutionary Forces Should Unite' is very good, it has timely pointed out the direction for our revolutionary rebels to advance."

Some revolutionary students from the liaison groups of some universities and colleges in the capital held a study and discussion session this afternoon. When they talked about their experiences of deepening into the factories and combining with the workers in the recent period, they said: The working class listens to Chairman Mao's words the most. Once they take action, they have the strongest rebel spirit, the most thorough revolutionary spirit, and the greatest creativity. This time, our great leader Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the workers' revolutionary movement. The revolutionary rebel forces in the factories have developed rapidly and grown stronger in the struggle, fearlessly launching a head-on attack against the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. We are determined to combine with the revolutionary workers, roll together with them, fight together with them, and jointly repel the rampant counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. The warriors of the "Red Flag" and "Red Ninth Company" of the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics stationed at the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory said, we revolutionary rebels are the masters of the world, the masters of society, and the masters of the country. We revolutionary students must not be afraid of attacks and slander, we must definitely adhere to the correct direction indicated by Chairman Mao, achieve the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The revolutionary rebels of the "East Red" Commune of the Beijing Institute of Mining said, we cheer for the great unity of the revolutionary forces! The great unity of the revolutionary forces is our strong demand and voice. The editorial article from the *Red Flag* magazine has once again expressed the wishes of us broad warriors. The warriors of the "Jinggangshan" Red Guards of this institute also pointed out: To achieve the great unity of the revolutionary forces, we must break private interests and establish public interests, resolutely oppose individualism, sectarianism, factionalism, and cliquism. The revolutionary organizations such as the "East Red" Commune of the Coal Mining Teaching and Research Room also successively proposed suggestions, advocating the immediate establishment of a unified action liaison station for the institute, implementing the unity of all revolutionary rebel forces, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

    在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下革命造反派实行大联合
    坚决向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权
    上海百万革命造反大军和首都广大革命造反者决心贯彻《红旗》杂志评论员文章的精神，学习北京第一机床厂誓师大会给毛主席的致敬信，坚决遵循毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑
    据新华社上海十六日电　《红旗》杂志评论员文章《无产阶级革命派联合起来》和北京第一机床厂“抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”誓师大会给毛主席的致敬信，再一次给正在无所畏惧地向资产阶级反动路线举行大反攻的上海百万革命造反大军，带来了巨大的鼓舞，增添了新的革命的信心和力量。他们感到十分亲切，十分振奋，决心用实际行动贯彻《红旗》杂志评论员文章的精神，学习北京第一机床厂红色造反者顶天立地的无产阶级革命气概，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，进一步实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，团结一切革命力量，紧紧掌握住无产阶级政治、经济、文化的大权，建立革命新秩序，坚持社会主义大方向，抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线乘胜前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，誓夺一九六七年的革命、生产双胜利。
    上海的大门——北站，自从革命造反派工人接管以来，出现了一派生气勃勃的新气象。月台上秩序井然，沪宁、沪杭两线运输畅通。这是铁路部门革命造反派工人在红卫兵小将的协助下，团结广大革命职工，抓革命、促生产，彻底粉碎一小撮反动家伙策划的停水、停电、停交通阴谋的巨大胜利。上海铁路革命造反工人联合指挥部负责人深有体会地说：只有实行无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，才能把领导权从一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人手中夺过来；也只有实行无产阶级革命造反派的大联合，才能巩固已经夺得的权利，才能建立革命的新秩序。革命造反工人的大联合，就是在毛泽东思想旗帜下的大团结，只有这样的大联合，才能统一思想，统一指挥，统一步调，发挥最大的力量。
    战斗在上海港的革命造反派工人读了《红旗》杂志评论员文章后一致认为，文章说得对，说得好。这些革命造反派工人连日来高举毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的大旗，敢于顶阴风，挑大梁，团结革命工人，同资产阶级反动路线展开了坚决的斗争。
    上海港的革命造反派工人还指出：把领导权从一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固执行资产阶级反动路线的人的手中夺过来，还只是初步的胜利。要巩固这个胜利，一定要把这些党内走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗臭、斗垮，不这样，他们还会像毒蛇一样反过头来咬你一口，这个权是不巩固的。要巩固这个胜利，一定要保证领导权牢牢掌握在真正的无产阶级革命左派手里，务必提高政治警惕性，防止坏人混水摸鱼。
    中国人民银行上海分行革命造反队总部的队员们说：经济大权由革命造反派掌握，就不会发生破坏社会主义金融的情况。最近，全市银行系统的六个革命造反组织已经联合起来，把掌握上海经济命脉的银行领导权，真正掌握在革命左派的手里。
    求新造船厂工人革命造反大队负责人说：我们工厂的工人革命造反大队等八个造反派组织一月十三日夺取了工厂的领导大权以后，革命秩序很好，一切生产指挥系统都很正常。革命群众反映，这个权夺得好。要是不夺这些党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，发展下去，企业就会变颜色，走到修正主义的道路上去。这位负责人说，“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”，我们革命造反派一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，牢牢掌握大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    据新华社十六日讯　北京第一机床厂“抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”誓师大会给毛主席的致敬信，和《红旗》杂志的《无产阶级革命派联合起来》的评论员文章，在首都革命造反者中引起了强烈的反响。大家热烈响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，表示一定要好好学习上海无产阶级革命的经验，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下实行大联合，同一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子进行针锋相对的斗争，把政治、经济、文化的大权，牢牢掌握在自己手里。
    给我们伟大领袖毛主席写致敬信的北京第一机床厂红色造反者和其他革命职工，当他们知道这封信在电台广播，在报纸上刊载时，高兴得欢呼跳跃，奔走相告。“毛主席万万岁”的欢呼声响彻全厂。红色造反战士和其他革命职工说：这是毛主席对我们的最大关怀，最大支持，最大鼓舞。这是一件大喜事。我们一定实现给毛主席致敬信中的保证，坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，誓夺革命、生产双胜利。一定站在毛主席的革命路线一边，实行无产阶级革命派的大联合，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的家伙手中，把权夺过来，把他们斗倒，斗臭，斗垮。今晚，北京市许多工厂、学校、机关的革命造反派组织，还在第一机床厂召开了“抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”的大会。会上，人们欢欣鼓舞，斗志昂扬，显示了革命造反派联合在一起的大好形势和巨大力量。
    首都职工红色造反总联络站、首都职工革命造反总部负责人说：上海工人阶级和其他革命群众、革命干部联合起来，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和极少数坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子夺权的经验，对我们有极大的启发和帮助。我们决心像上海革命造反派那样，以无产阶级革命派为核心，团结一切革命力量，对一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派开展全面的斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    北京建华铸钢厂红色造反大队部分队员，在文化大革命中深深感到，无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，是文化大革命的中心任务。我们一定要冲破党内走资本主义道路的当权派的阻挠和破坏，以上海工人阶级为榜样，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，实现无产阶级革命派大联合，迎头痛击资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！
    正在反击资产阶级反动路线新反扑的北京玻璃总厂革命造反派的一些战士，今天在座谈中说，“无产阶级革命派联合起来”这个口号好得很，给我们革命造反派及时指出了前进的方向。
    首都部分大专院校下厂联络小组的一些革命学生，今天下午进行了学习座谈。他们谈到最近一个时期深入工厂同工人结合的体会时说：工人阶级最听毛主席的话。他们一旦行动起来，造反精神最强，革命精神最彻底，创造性最大。这次，我们伟大的领袖毛主席又亲自点燃起工人革命运动的熊熊烈火。工厂中的革命造反派在斗争中蓬勃发展，迅速壮大，无所畏惧地向资产阶级反动路线的新反扑进行迎头痛击。我们决心和革命工人相结合，和他们滚在一起，战斗在一起，共同击退资产阶级反动路线的猖狂反扑。北航“红旗”“红九连”驻北京光华木材厂战斗小组的战士们说，我们革命造反派，是天下的主人，是社会的主人，是国家的主人。我们革命学生，就是要不怕打击诽谤，一定要坚持毛主席指引的正确方向，实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    北京矿业学院“东方红”公社的革命造反派说，我们为革命派的大联合而欢呼！革命派的大联合，是我们的强烈要求与呼声。《红旗》杂志评论员文章又一次表达了我们广大战士的心愿。这个学院的“井冈山”红卫兵的战士还指出：要实现革命派的大联合，必须破私立公，坚决反对个人主义、本位主义、山头主义、风头主义和宗派主义。采煤教研室的“东方红”公社等革命组织也相继提出建议，主张立即成立学院统一行动联络站，实行一切革命造反派联合起来，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指引下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
