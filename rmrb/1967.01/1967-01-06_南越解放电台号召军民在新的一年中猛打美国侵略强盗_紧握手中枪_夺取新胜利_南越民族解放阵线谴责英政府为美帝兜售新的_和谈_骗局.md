South Vietnam Liberation Radio calls on military and civilians to strike hard against American aggressors in the new year
Hold your guns firmly and seize new victories
The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam condemns the British government for peddling a new "peace talks" hoax for the U.S. imperialists

Hanoi, January 6 (New China News Agency) — The South Vietnam Liberation Radio issued a commentary on January 1, calling on the heroic military and civilians of South Vietnam, together with the people of the entire country, to continue to raise the banner of determination to defeat the American aggressors in the new year, fight more fiercely, and achieve more glorious victories.

The commentary said that in the past two years, especially in 1966, the military and civilians of South Vietnam have successfully resisted the tens of thousands of American aggressor troops and mercenary troops, backed by 500,000 puppet troops. This shows that the military and civilians of South Vietnam have sufficient strength to defeat any expeditionary force of the Americans and any form of war waged by the Americans.

The commentary emphasized: The military and civilians of South Vietnam are entering 1967 with an overwhelming momentum to defeat the enemy. Our strength is unprecedentedly strong. Our situation is infinitely good. Time is on our side. All progressive humanity stands on our side. We will definitely achieve the greatest and most glorious victories.

The commentary pointed out that U.S. imperialism is plotting to send more troops to South Vietnam and adopt more barbaric means to "pacify" the countryside. However, no matter how many troops it sends, it cannot save its heavy defeat. No matter how many crimes it commits, it cannot shake the will of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people are determined to fight more fiercely and strive for greater victories.

The commentary pointed out that the American aggressors' deceptive "peace talks" tricks cannot deceive the people of South Vietnam and cannot make the people of South Vietnam lay down their arms, allowing U.S. imperialism to obtain what it cannot achieve on the battlefield.

The commentary stated that the military and civilians of South Vietnam will continue to hold their guns firmly, launch a high tide of resistance against U.S. imperialism, and continue to write heroic epics.

Hanoi, January 5 (New China News Agency) — According to a report from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the External Relations Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on January 4, condemning British Foreign Secretary Brown's so-called "peace talks proposal" for serving U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

The statement said that Brown's "peace talks proposal" on the Vietnam issue is actually intended to cover up the conspiracy and actions of U.S. imperialism to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, and to peddle the "peace talks" hoax for U.S. imperialism. After listing numerous facts of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, the statement pointed out that the British government deliberately distorts the facts, equating the aggressors with the victims, and even plotting to gain a position for the corrupt and traitorous clique — the Saigon puppet regime, which is despised by the people of South Vietnam — in resolving the South Vietnam issue, a position it cannot possibly have.

The statement said: "The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fully supports the condemnation and refutation of Brown's 'proposal' by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Wilson government must remember: U.S. imperialism is the aggressor; it must stop the aggression and get out of South Vietnam. The force that decides the situation in South Vietnam is the people of South Vietnam, with the National Liberation Front as their sole true representative."

The statement finally said that the Wilson government's policy of following the United States cannot save its international prestige, which is declining day by day, and will inevitably provoke greater indignation and opposition from the British people and the people of the world.

    南越解放电台号召军民在新的一年中猛打美国侵略强盗
    紧握手中枪　夺取新胜利
    南越民族解放阵线谴责英政府为美帝兜售新的“和谈”骗局
    新华社河内电　越南南方解放电台一日发表评论，号召英雄的越南南方军民同全国人民一道，在新的一年里，继续高举决心战胜美国侵略强盗的旗帜，打得更猛，夺取更加辉煌的胜利。
    评论说，近两年来，尤其是一九六六年，越南南方军民胜利地抗击了得到五十万伪军配合的数十万美国侵略军和帮凶军。这表明南方军民有足够的力量战胜美国的任何一种远征军，战胜美国的任何一种形式的战争。
    评论强调说：越南南方军民是以压倒敌人的气势进入一九六七年的。我们的力量空前强大。我们的情况无限好。时间是属于我们的。全体进步人类站在我们的一边。我们必定取得最巨大和最辉煌的胜利。
    评论指出，美帝国主义正在阴谋向越南南方增派军队，采取更加野蛮的手段“绥靖农村”。但是，不管它增派多少万军队，也挽救不了它的惨重失败。不管它犯下多少罪行，也无法动摇越南人民的意志。越南人民决心打得更猛，争取更大的胜利。
    评论指出，美国强盗的骗人的“和平谈判”伎俩，绝对欺骗不了越南南方人民，绝不能使越南南方人民放下武器，让美帝国主义取得在战场上无法取得的东西。
    评论表示，越南南方军民将继续紧握手中枪，掀起抗击美帝国主义的高潮，继续写下英雄的赞歌。
    新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会发言人四日发表声明，谴责英国外交大臣布朗提出所谓“和谈建议”，为美国侵略越南效劳。
    声明说，布朗关于越南问题的“和谈建议”，实际上是为了掩盖美帝国主义加强和扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋和行动，为美帝国主义兜售“和平谈判”骗局。声明在列举美帝国主义侵略越南大量的事实之后指出，英国政府蓄意歪曲事实，把侵略者和被侵略者等同起来，甚至还阴谋为被越南南方人民所唾弃的腐朽的卖国走狗集团——西贡伪政权捞取它在解决越南南方问题上不可能有的地位。
    声明说：“越南南方民族解放阵线完全赞同越南民主共和国外交部发言人对布朗的‘建议’的谴责和驳斥。威尔逊政府必须记住：美帝国主义是侵略者，它必须停止侵略和滚出越南南方，决定越南南方局势的力量是以民族解放阵线为其唯一真正的代表的越南南方人民。”
    声明最后说，威尔逊政府追随美国的政策决不能挽救它的正在日益下降的国际威信，并且必定激起英国人民和世界人民的更大愤慨和反对。
