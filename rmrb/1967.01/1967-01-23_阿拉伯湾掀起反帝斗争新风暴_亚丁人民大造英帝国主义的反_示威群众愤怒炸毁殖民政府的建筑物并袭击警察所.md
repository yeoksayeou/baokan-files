Thousands of people in Aden continued to demonstrate on January 20 against the rule of British imperialism.

The demonstrations began on January 19.

The demonstrators carried placards with slogans denouncing British occupation of Aden and hailing the armed revolution of the Aden people for complete liberation.

The British colonial authorities in Aden sent out troops and police to suppress the demonstrations. The demonstrators set up barricades in the streets and retaliated with grenades, rifles, iron bars, and stones. They attacked several police stations, killing and injuring about twenty British troops and police, and burning or blowing up some buildings of the colonial government agencies.

The Cairo weekly "Today's News" reported on the same day that British imperialism, in order to deal with the situation in Aden, has already sent a large number of troops to the Arabian Gulf region. Large numbers of British troops have already landed in Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, and Bahrain.

The Cairo "Pyramids" newspaper commented in an editorial on the same day on the struggle of the Aden people: "The experience of Arab countries and many other countries in the world indeed proves that imperialism will not surrender voluntarily, will not yield to the inevitable will of history and the needs of our times, unless it is forced to do so."

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, January 19

According to a report by the Middle East News Agency, on the 128th anniversary of British occupation of South Yemen's Aden, Arab workers and citizens in Aden held a general strike and large-scale demonstrations on January 19.

The report said that Arab workers at the British military base in Aden also participated in the strike. Activities in the port of Aden have come to a standstill. Traffic was disrupted, and shops were closed. Demonstrators set fire to some buildings and cars of the puppet regime of the "Federation of South Arabia." They also set up barricades in the streets and fought back against the suppression of the British colonial authorities with grenades and rifles.

The Political Bureau Chairman of the National Liberation Front of Occupied South Yemen, Asnag, issued a statement in the organ of the Front, "Revolutionary Newspaper," on British colonial rule in Aden for 128 years. He exposed that British imperialism is trying to sabotage the struggle of the South Yemen people for national independence. He said that British imperialism is currently trying to deceive the people by promising fake independence for South Yemen next year, attempting to maintain its rule through its puppet regime.

Asnag said that no matter what tricks British imperialism and its agents play, the people of South Yemen are determined to continue along the path of armed struggle. They are fully convinced that British imperialism and its puppets are doomed to failure.

　　阿拉伯湾掀起反帝斗争新风暴
　　亚丁人民大造英帝国主义的反
　　示威群众愤怒炸毁殖民政府的建筑物并袭击警察所
    新华社开罗二十一日电　据开罗报纸二十一日报道，亚丁二十日有几千人继续举行示威，反对英帝国主义的统治。
    这次示威是从十九日开始的。
    示威者举着标语牌，上面写着口号，谴责英国占领亚丁和欢呼亚丁人民为争取彻底解放而进行的武装革命。
    亚丁的英国殖民当局出动军警进行镇压。示威者在街道上设置障碍物，并且用手榴弹、步枪、铁棍和石块进行反击。他们袭击了一些警察派出所，打死打伤英国军警约二十人，烧毁或炸毁一些殖民政府机关的建筑物。
    开罗《今天消息》周刊同一天报道，英帝国主义为了对付亚丁的局势，已经向阿拉伯湾地区大量增兵。大批英军已经在沙迦、阿布达比和巴林登陆。
    《金字塔报》同一天在评论亚丁人民斗争的一篇社论中指出：“阿拉伯国家以及世界各地许多国家的经验确实证明：帝国主义是决不会自动投降的，是决不会屈服于历史的必然意志和我们时代的需要的，除非它被迫这样做。”
    新华社开罗十九日电 据中东通讯社报道：在英帝国主义侵占南也门的亚丁一百二十八周年的时候，亚丁的阿拉伯工人和市民十九日举行了总罢工和大规模示威。
    消息说，在亚丁的英国军事基地的阿拉伯工人也参加了罢工。亚丁港的活动已陷于瘫痪。交通中断，商店都关了门。示威者放火焚烧了傀儡政权
  “南阿拉伯联邦政府”的一些建筑物和汽车。他们还在街道上设置障碍物，用手榴弹和步枪抗击英国殖民当局的镇压。
    被占领的南也门解放阵线政治局主席阿斯纳杰在这个阵线的机关报《革命报》上就英国对亚丁进行了一百二十八年的殖民统治发表声明，揭露英帝国主义正在力图破坏南也门人民争取民族独立的斗争。他说，英帝国主义目前正企图通过答应明年给南也门假独立来欺骗人民，企图通过它的傀儡政权来维持它的统治。
    阿斯纳杰说，不管英帝国主义及其代理人玩弄什么阴谋，南也门人民决心继续沿着武装斗争的道路前进，他们完全相信，英帝国主义及其傀儡是注定要失败的。
