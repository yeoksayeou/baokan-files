Under the call of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chiang Kai-shek's Air Force Major Once Chao Pin abandoned darkness for light and returned to the motherland.

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY GUANGZHOU JANUARY 5 - Major Once Chao Pin, formerly of the Chiang Kai-shek clique's Air Force communications department, has abandoned darkness for light and recently returned to Guangzhou from the United States.

On January 4, Wu Fushan, a responsible person from the Guangzhou Military Region Air Force of the People's Liberation Army, received Once Chao Pin and welcomed his patriotic act of abandoning darkness for light. He presented Once Chao Pin with a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," encouraging him to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, to reform his thoughts, and to serve the people wholeheartedly.

Once Chao Pin expressed his deep gratitude to the people's government and the People's Liberation Army for their warm welcome and care.

Once Chao Pin is originally from Ba County, Sichuan. In December 1965, he was sent to the United States for training by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek. He had long seen that our great motherland, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, had made tremendous strides in construction and that its national defense was growing stronger day by day. He yearned for his motherland and was increasingly dissatisfied with the evil rule of the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, feeling that serving the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek had no future. Recently, under the call of our country's unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he broke through numerous obstacles and resolutely returned to the motherland.

    在无产阶级文化大革命的感召下
    蒋帮空军少校曾朝品弃暗投明回祖国
    新华社广州五日电　原蒋介石集团空军少校通讯官曾朝品弃暗投明，最近由美国回到广州。
    一月四日，中国人民解放军广州部队空军负责人吴富善接见了曾朝品，对他弃暗投明的爱国行动表示欢迎，并赠送给他一部《毛泽东选集》，勉励他努力学习毛主席著作，好好改造思想，全心全意为人民服务。
    曾朝品对人民政府和人民解放军对他的欢迎和关怀表示十分感激。
    曾朝品原籍四川巴县人，一九六五年十二月，受美、蒋派遣到美国受训。他早就看到，我们伟大祖国在共产党和毛主席领导下，建设事业突飞猛进，国防力量日益强大，对祖国十分向往，对美蒋反动派在台湾的罪恶统治更加不满，深感为美蒋卖命没有前途。最近他在我国史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的感召下，冲破重重障碍，毅然返回祖国。
