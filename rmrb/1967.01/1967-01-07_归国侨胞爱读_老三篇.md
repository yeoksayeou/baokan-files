Overseas Chinese returning home love reading the "Three Articles."

The second batch of Indonesian refugees returning home on the Zhonghua Ship, with boundless love for Chairman Mao and boundless admiration for Mao Zedong Thought, eagerly study the "Three Articles." They learn and apply what they learn, promoting the revolutionization of their thinking, and good deeds are abundant.

Young overseas Chinese worker Luo Quangui, after studying the "Three Articles," firmly remembered the words, "Our army is entirely for the liberation of the people, and it works thoroughly for the people's interests." He uses this standard to demand of himself in everything he does. While in Zhanjiang, a nearby village's house caught fire. He and another young overseas Chinese, Ye Yucai, bravely rushed into the collapsed house to rescue belongings. After the fire was extinguished, he gave his own quilt and the pocket money issued by the state to the elderly woman who had suffered the disaster. When people praised him, Luo Quangui humbly replied, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'It is easy for a person to do a good deed, but difficult to do good deeds all one's life.' I have only done one or two good deeds, and I am still far from the standard of 'selflessly serving the people' and 'completely' and 'thoroughly' working for the people as taught by Chairman Mao!"

An elderly overseas Chinese worker, He Zhong, whose son was killed by the Indonesian reactionaries, always tears up when he opens the "Three Articles." He said, "In Indonesia, reading Chairman Mao's books was 'illegal' and would get you arrested, or even killed. Truly, one does not know the bitterness of the past if one does not know the sweetness of today!" After reading the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he told his children, "Chairman Mao says, 'To struggle means to make sacrifices.' Your brother Yu Nan died for the people, and that was a worthy death. Under the fascist rule of American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, how many people have suffered the same fate as us? Thinking of this, we must turn our hatred into strength, read Chairman Mao's books well, build our country well, and support the liberation struggle of all oppressed peoples."

    归国侨胞爱读“老三篇”
    第二批乘光华轮回国的印尼难侨，怀着无限热爱毛主席和无限崇拜毛泽东思想的深情，如饥似渴地学习“老三篇”。他们学了就用，促进思想革命化，好人好事大量涌现。
    归侨年轻工人骆权礼学了“老三篇”以后，牢牢地记住了“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的”这一段话，并且处处事事用这个标准来要求自己。在湛江时，他住的附近村子里的一家居民失火了，他和另一个归侨青年叶玉才奋不顾身地钻进已经倒塌的房子里，去抢救东西。救完了火，他又把自己的一件毛毯和国家发给他的零花钱包好送给这家受灾的老太太。当人们赞扬他时，骆权礼却谦虚地回答说：“毛主席教导我们：‘一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事’。我只做了一两件事，距离毛主席所教导的‘毫不利己专门利人’，‘完全’、‘彻底’地为人民的标准，还差得很远呢！”
    儿子被印尼反动派杀害了的难侨老工人何仲，每当翻开“老三篇”时，总是热泪盈眶。他说：“在印尼，读毛主席的书就是‘犯法’，就要被抓，甚至丢了性命。真是不知昔日苦，就不知今日甜啊！”他读了《为人民服务》这篇文章以后，对孩子们说：“毛主席说，要奋斗就会有牺牲。你哥哥裕南为人民而死，就是死得其所。在美帝国主义和各国反动派的法西斯统治下，和我们有着同样遭遇的何止千万。想到这一点，就要把仇恨化为力量，好好读毛主席的书，好好建设祖国，支援一切被压迫人民的解放斗争。”
