The great leader and helmsman Chairman Mao's revolutionary thoughts are a guiding light. His works are the highest level of contemporary Marxist-Leninist classics, and are the sharpest and most powerful ideological weapons for all oppressed peoples struggling for liberation. Without studying Chairman Mao's works, the revolution cannot be completed.

In his essay "In Memory of Norman Bethune," Chairman Mao wrote: "We all should learn from his spirit of complete selflessness. From this point of view, one can become a person of great benefit to the people. A person's abilities may be great or small, but as long as they have this spirit, they are a person of noble character, a person of purity, a person of high morals, a person who has risen above petty interests, a person of benefit to the people." I resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions on this point. Only in this way can one become a good soldier guided by the great thought of Mao Zedong.

Chairman Mao's works are an inexhaustible source of strength and wisdom, an indispensable part of my life. In the future, I will make the most of my spare time to study Chairman Mao's works.

　　不读毛主席的书就不能完成革命
    伟大领袖、伟大舵手毛主席的革命思想是指路明灯。他的著作是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义经典，是为争取解放而斗争的所有被压迫人民的最锋利、最强大的思想武器。不学习毛主席的著作，就不能完成革命。
    毛主席在《纪念白求恩》一文中写道：“我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”我坚决按照毛主席的这一指示办事，只有这样，才有可能成为受伟大的毛泽东思想指导的好战士。
    毛主席的著作是取之不尽的力量和智慧的源泉，是我的生活中所不可缺少的。我今后将尽量利用空闲时间学习毛主席著作。				　几内亚　一工人
