Representatives of African nationalist organizations in Cairo issued a statement on the sixth anniversary of the assassination of Congolese national hero Lumumba, condemning the collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism in supporting the puppet regime of Mobutu. They reaffirmed their resolute support for the armed struggle of the Congolese people.

A member of the Botswana People's Party National Executive Committee, Bobbi Mark, stated: "Mobutu is a notorious tool of U.S. imperialism. Mobutu uses white mercenaries to suppress the revolutionary struggle of the Congolese people, and his hands are stained with the blood of the Congolese people."

Mark emphasized: "The Khrushchev revisionists are also accomplices in the U.S. murder of Lumumba, because they advocated, together with the U.S., sending 'UN troops' to Congo. He pointed out that the Soviet modern revisionists are now engaged in conspiratorial activities to promote so-called 'reconciliation' between Congolese patriots and Mobutu; the Soviet Union also intends to restore diplomatic relations with the reactionary regime of Mobutu. This is a blatant attempt to sabotage the liberation struggle of the Congolese people and is a major exposure of their treachery against the oppressed peoples of the world."

Mark concluded: "The Congolese people and all African peoples have learned from the criminal activities of the U.S.-Soviet collusion to be vigilant in our common struggle against U.S. imperialism and its accomplices led by Soviet revisionists. We will act according to the words of Chairman Mao: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' We reaffirm our resolute support for the Congolese people."

Representatives of the South West Africa People's Organization, Kagimuira Vii and Moses Kagiongua, stated: "The Soviet revisionists' desire to establish diplomatic relations with Mobutu is not only a betrayal but also a U.S.-Soviet conspiracy to extinguish the revolutionary struggle of the Congolese people and to control Congo and the entire African continent."

The statement, discussing the favorable situation of the struggle of the Congolese and African peoples, said: "As Chairman Mao said: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause, and they will not deviate from this logic.' It is certain that Mobutu will not deviate from this logic. As for the Congolese people, they will 'struggle, fail, struggle again, fail again, struggle again, until victory.'"

A representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, Sijak, told Xinhua News Agency: "U.S. imperialism and its puppet Mobutu, as well as Soviet modern revisionists, are responsible for the murder of Lumumba. He said: 'From what has happened and is happening in Congo, we draw the conclusion: the oppressed peoples' struggle against imperialism should also be a struggle against modern revisionism.'"

A representative of the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee, Sitole, revealed: "The Soviet Union is trying to persuade Congolese nationalists to cooperate with Mobutu. The U.S. is the creator of all the chaos in Congo, and the Soviet Union is its accomplice. We African people should learn from the Congolese incident to distinguish between enemies and friends."

A representative of the Basutoland Convention Party, Mapafani, said: "No matter what tricks the U.S. and its accomplices play in Congo, they cannot deceive the Congolese people and all revolutionary peoples of Africa. Their conspiracies are doomed to fail. The Congolese people are determined to fight for true independence and liberation, and they will surely win. All African peoples stand with the Congolese people."

    非洲民族主义组织代表谈卢蒙巴被害的历史教训
    刚果事件使非洲人民认清了敌友 
    苏修集团充分暴露美帝帮凶面目
    据新华社开罗十五日电　驻开罗的非洲民族主义组织的代表在刚果（利）民族英雄卢蒙巴被害六周年前夕，在这里发表声明谴责美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义勾结起来支持蒙博托傀儡政权，并重申他们坚决支持刚果（利）人民的武装斗争。
    贝专纳人民党全国执行委员会委员波比·马克发表声明说：“蒙博托是美帝国主义的臭名昭彰的工具。蒙博托使用白人雇佣军镇压刚果人民的革命斗争，他的双手沾满了刚果人民的鲜血。”
    马克强调说：“赫鲁晓夫修正主义者也是美国杀害卢蒙巴的帮凶，因为他们同美国一道主张派‘联合国军’到刚果。”他指出，苏联现代修正主义者现在正搞阴谋活动，要刚果爱国者和蒙博托之间进行所谓的“和解”；苏联并且打算同蒙博托反动政权恢复外交关系，这是公然企图破坏刚果（利）人民的解放斗争，也是他们出卖世界被压迫人民勾当的一次大暴露。
    马克最后说：“刚果人民和全体非洲人民从苏美勾结的罪恶活动中得到了教训，懂得了在我们反对美帝国主义及其以苏联修正主义者为首的帮凶的共同斗争中要提高警惕。我们要按照毛主席的话办事，‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’我们重申，我们坚决支持刚果人民。”
    西南非洲民族联盟代表卡吉穆伊纳·维伊和莫塞斯·卡吉翁瓜发表声明指出：“苏联修正主义者希望同蒙博托建立外交关系，这不仅是叛卖行径，而且也是美苏合作，妄图扑灭刚果人民的革命斗争，进而控制刚果（利）和整个非洲的罪恶勾当。”
    声明在谈到刚果（利）人民和非洲人民斗争的有利形势时说：“正如毛主席所说：‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。’肯定地说，蒙博托决不会违背这个逻辑。至于刚果（利）人民，他们将‘斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利’。”
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会代表塞贾克对新华社记者说，美帝国主义及其傀儡蒙博托和苏联现代修正主义者应对杀害卢蒙巴负责，他说：“从刚果已经发生和正在发生的事件中，我们得出这样的结论：被压迫人民反对帝国主义，也应当反对现代修正主义。”
    莫三鼻给革命委员会代表西托尔揭露，“苏联企图说服刚果民族主义者同蒙博托合作。美国是刚果（利）一切乱子的制造者，苏联是它的帮凶。我们非洲人民应该从刚果事件中学会分清敌友。”
    巴苏陀兰大会党代表马帕法尼说：“不管美国及其帮凶在刚果（利）耍什么花招，都欺骗不了刚果（利）人民和非洲的一切革命人民。他们的一切阴谋是注定要失败的。刚果（利）人民决心为争取真正的独立和解放而斗争，他们一定会胜利，全体非洲人民站在刚果人民一边。”
