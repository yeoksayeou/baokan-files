Edition: 4

The Chinese People's Liberation Army Nanjing Military Region, a model unit for studying Chairman Mao's works, the Fourth Company of a certain artillery regiment, has long insisted on actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's personally drafted Ancient Town Conference Resolution, that is, "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party." They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and have been consecutively rated as a Four Good Company for five years. Recently, they invited old comrades back to the company to hold a study session on this brilliant work. Cadres and soldiers, with boundless revolutionary passion for Chairman Mao, shared their study experiences and insights. Through vivid and concrete facts and experiences, they explained that the Ancient Town Conference Resolution is the guiding principle for building the party and the army, and the lifeline of our army's construction. Everyone expressed their determination to resolutely implement and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and to forever be loyal soldiers of the people who uphold Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Encountering Issues, Refer to the "Resolution" and Resolutely Implement Chairman Mao's Military Line

The former political instructor of the Fourth Company, Fei Jinbao, said: All routines can be broken, but the fundamental routine of political construction of the military must not be broken. In early 1964, our company focused on military training and production, squeezing out political study. After just half a month, several comrades fell ill. The party branch was greatly shocked and immediately held a cadre meeting to discuss the issue. At that time, the deputy company commander, Feng Yong'an, opened the Ancient Town Conference Resolution and pointed to the section on "purely military viewpoint," saying: "The fundamental reason is that we did not follow Chairman Mao's instructions and deviated from politics." Someone disagreed, saying: "Training requires rapid improvement in skills, so we must break the routine and pay the price." The question was: which one is correct? This is a major issue of which path the company's construction should take. The party branch let everyone bring their questions and review the Ancient Town Conference Resolution again.

Chairman Mao said: "Military affairs are just one of the tools to accomplish political tasks," and "the Red Army is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks." Our army has grown and strengthened by implementing Chairman Mao's political military line. Previously, our company had many problems. Later, by implementing the 1960 Military Commission Enlarged Conference Resolution and studying the Ancient Town Conference Resolution, we clarified Chairman Mao's military line, insisted on the "four firsts," and the cadres and soldiers' spiritual outlook underwent a fundamental change. I thought more and more that the idea of "breaking the routine and paying the price" was actually to "break" the routine of insisting on Chairman Mao's military line and to "pay the price" of abandoning Chairman Mao's military thoughts. How could that be acceptable! The next day, we held an expanded meeting of the party branch. Because we studied the Ancient Town Conference Resolution with questions in mind before the meeting, we quickly unified our thoughts. Everyone said: Building the company politically is Chairman Mao's military thought, it is the direction. All routines can be broken, but the routine of political military construction must not be broken! The meeting immediately decided to strengthen political and ideological work, ensure daily study of Chairman Mao's works, and normalize the company's life order. Later, whether in training or production, we insisted on prioritizing politics, and ideological work followed wherever we went. At the year-end evaluation, we were again rated as a Four Good Company.

Deputy Squad Leader Zheng Hanqing said: All banners can be discarded, but the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be discarded. Our squad insists on actively learning and applying the Ancient Town Conference Resolution, prioritizing politics, and has been consecutively rated as a Four Good Squad, with all work relatively good. The company's five mobile competition banners have four that are always with us. For a period, the company emphasized training and production, but our squad still insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works. During the company's evaluation, we only had one banner for studying Chairman Mao's works left. Some people felt that the advanced squad was no longer advanced and suggested that the squad leader relax the study of Chairman Mao's works, focus on other work, and snatch back the banners. The squad leader firmly refused, saying: "All banners can be discarded, but the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be discarded! This banner is the commander, the soul. As long as we hold this great banner higher, we will be invincible!" He led us to review the Ancient Town Conference Resolution and discussed the differences between the people's army and the old army, making us deeply realize that: The political direction that Chairman Mao set for our army is unshakable; the military line that Chairman Mao set for our army is the only correct one. People's soldiers, under any circumstances, must, as stated in the 1960 Military Commission Enlarged Conference Resolution, "hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further arm the minds of all officers and soldiers with Mao Zedong Thought, and insist on Mao Zedong Thought being in command in all work."

Later, we grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works even more tightly. Mao Zedong Thought is a bright lamp, illuminating through clouds and fog. Our squad not only continuously advances in ideological revolution but also completes training and production tasks well. At the year-end evaluation, we were again rated as a Four Good Squad. We must forever follow the path pointed out by the Ancient Town Conference Resolution, forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's military line, and forever prioritize politics.

Promoting "Publicness" to Thoroughly Implement Chairman Mao's Military Line

Company Commander Xu Zuwu said: Selflessness can thoroughly implement the "Resolution." In 1964, during the Four Good total evaluation, the party branch asked us to study a question: "We have studied the Ancient Town Conference Resolution for three years, why are we still influenced by the purely military viewpoint?" I brought this question and reviewed Chairman Mao's brilliant work. Chairman Mao said: "Not recognizing that the party and the Red Army are tools to execute revolutionary tasks, and oneself is a member of them. Not recognizing oneself as the subject of the revolution, but thinking that one is only responsible to the superior individually, not to the revolution. This passive mercenary revolutionary thought is also a manifestation of individualism." Reading these words, I was greatly shocked. Thinking back, I was afraid of not producing "experts" and not being able to report, so I led the reconnaissance squad to fiercely attack technical difficulties, spending a lot of time, brainpower, and effort, and won the first prize in the entire army's artillery reconnaissance soldiers' competition. The skills were "outstanding," but the squad's ideological problems also piled up. This was not taking responsibility for the revolution! The purely military viewpoint is a bourgeois thing. I harbored a "mercenary revolutionary" thought, so of course, I would be influenced by it! This study made me deeply realize that only selflessness can be fearless. If "self" is at the forefront, one will inevitably be afraid of this and that. Only by establishing the thought of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, becoming a selfless and fearless person, can one thoroughly implement the spirit of the Ancient Town Conference Resolution. If "self" interferes with oneself, even if one can recite the Ancient Town Conference Resolution fluently, one will still lose direction in the struggle between the two military lines.

Five Good Soldier, Livestock Feeder Song Hongpu said: Chairman Mao taught us: "Only paying attention to the interests of one's small group, not paying attention to the overall interests, on the surface is not for the individual, but in fact contains very narrow individualism, which also has great corrosive and centrifugal effects." Chairman Mao's words made me realize that only thinking for the small group is an expanded individualism. To thoroughly implement the spirit of the Ancient Town Conference Resolution, one must thoroughly revolutionize and only be selfless and public-spirited can one thoroughly implement the spirit of the Ancient Town Conference Resolution.

Insisting on Revolutionary Principles to Forever Implement Chairman Mao's Military Line

Deputy Company Commander Wang Hengye said: We must use Mao Zedong Thought to view things. The model soldier in our company who studies Chairman Mao's works, Squad Leader Guo Changgui, actively corrects tendencies that deviate from the Ancient Town Conference Resolution. Whatever does not prioritize politics, he will manage and dare to manage. But some people say he is meddlesome and interferes with others' business. Is this right or wrong? We organized everyone to study a section of the Ancient Town Conference Resolution: "Regarding the issue of party criticism, there is another point to mention, that is, some comrades' criticism does not pay attention to the major aspects but only to the minor aspects. They do not understand that the main task of criticism is to point out political and organizational errors." Everyone analyzed it with Chairman Mao's viewpoint and realized that regarding Guo Changgui, we should not only pay attention to his criticism of people not paying attention to manner and occasion, etc., minor aspects, but first look at him insisting on prioritizing politics and pointing out the shortcomings of not prioritizing politics in others. Such "wide management" is very good. Some said, Guo Changgui decided to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao when he joined the army and studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and the Ancient Town Conference Resolution. He often said: "Following Chairman Mao to revolutionize, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's military line." Some said, he not only manages others' deviations from the "Resolution" but is also a model in executing the "Resolution." Everyone cited many examples, all showing that Guo Changgui is a good soldier who prioritizes politics. This study made everyone understand a truth: Using Mao Zedong Thought to view things can distinguish right from wrong. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "party criticism should prevent subjectivity and vulgarization, speak with evidence, and criticize with attention to politics," we can see the essence and main aspects of the problem, not be blinded by non-essential and non-main aspects, and more actively execute the "Resolution," more actively defend the "Resolution," and better implement Chairman Mao's military line.

Squad Leader Guo Changgui said: The spirit of "wide management" should be promoted, but we should not just be satisfied with "wide management," we must manage well to better implement the "Resolution." This requires using Mao Zedong Thought to help others. A comrade complained about being a cook being unnoticed and unprofitable, not like doing technical work being famous and beneficial. I thought his idea was not in line with Chairman Mao's military thought, but he went to the kitchen, showing he could still obey the assignment. The problem is to improve his understanding of the cook's work, starting from here, further helping him prioritize politics. So, I told him about Chairman Mao's teaching: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people's service." I also reminisced about hard times with him. Later, his work changed greatly, and at the year-end evaluation, he was rated as a Five Good Soldier. This incident made me realize: We are determined to implement Chairman Mao's military line, but because there is not enough Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, and we do not deeply understand Chairman Mao's military thought, we may encounter various issues that do not prioritize politics during implementation. This requires using Mao Zedong Thought to help comrades and improve proletarian awareness. Later, I paid special attention to using Mao Zedong Thought to help others. I deeply felt more and more: "Wide management" is to defend Chairman Mao's military line and to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. I am determined to "manage widely" for the revolution all my life, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought all my life, and to defend Chairman Mao's military line.

    古田会议决议是我军建设的命根子
    ——南京部队炮兵某部四连学习《关于纠正党内的错误思想》讲用会
    中国人民解放军南京部队学习毛主席著作先进单位、炮兵某部四连，长期坚持活学活用毛主席亲手起草的古田会议决议，即《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，连续五年被评为四好连队。最近，他们邀请老同志回连，一起举行了学习这篇光辉著作的讲用会。干部、战士们怀着对毛主席无限热爱的革命激情，畅谈学习心得体会，通过生动、具体的事实和经验说明：古田会议决议是建党建军的纲领，是我军建设的命根子。大家表示，一定要坚决贯彻和保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，永远做忠于毛主席的革命路线的人民战士。
    遇事对照“决议”坚决贯彻毛主席的建军路线
    四连原指导员费金宝说：什么常规都可以打破，政治建军的根本常规决不能打破。一九六四年初，我们连突击军事和生产，挤掉了政治学习。才半个月，就有几个同志病了。党支部大受震动，立即召开干部会议研究。当时的副连长冯永安翻开古田会议决议，指着“关于单纯军事观点”这一段说：“根本的原因，是没有照毛主席的指示办事，脱离政治。”有人不赞成，说：“训练要迅速提高技术，就要打破常规，付出代价。”到底哪一个对？这是连队建设走哪一条道路的大问题。党支部让大家带着问题重温古田会议决议。
    毛主席说：“军事只是完成政治任务的工具之一”，“红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”。我军就是贯彻执行毛主席的政治建军路线成长壮大起来的。以前，我们连问题一直不少。后来贯彻了一九六○年军委扩大会议决议，学习了古田会议决议，明确了毛主席的建军路线，坚持了“四个第一”，干部战士精神面貌发生了根本变化。我越想越觉得所谓要“打破常规，付出代价”的那种意见，实际上是要“打破”坚持毛主席的建军路线的“常规”，是要“付出”丢掉毛主席的建军思想的“代价”，那怎么能行！第二天，我们又召开支委扩大会议。因为会前带着问题学习了古田会议决议，便很快统一了思想，大家说：从政治上建设连队，是毛主席的建军思想，是方向问题，什么常规都可以打破，政治建军的常规绝对不能打破！会议当即作出了加强政治思想工作，每天坚持学习毛主席著作和保证连队生活秩序正常化的决议。以后无论训练、生产，我们都坚持了突出政治，外出人员走到哪里，思想工作跟到哪里。年终又评为四好连队。
    副班长郑汉卿说：什么锦旗都可丢，毛泽东思想伟大红旗不能丢。我们班坚持活学活用古田会议决议，坚持突出政治，连年被评为四好班，各项工作都比较好，连里的五面流动竞赛红旗，有四面始终在我们班。有一段时间，连里强调训练、生产，我们班还是坚持学习毛主席著作，连里评比时，我们班只剩下了一面学习毛主席著作的红旗。有人就觉得先进班不先进了，要班长放松一下毛主席著作的学习，突击一下其他的工作，把红旗夺回来。班长坚决不干，他说：“什么锦旗都可丢，毛泽东思想伟大红旗不能丢！这面红旗是统帅，是灵魂，只要我们更高地举起这面伟大红旗，就无往而不胜！”他领着我们重温古田会议决议，叫大家讨论人民军队和旧军队的区别，使大家深刻认识到：毛主席给我军规定的政治方向，是坚定不移的；毛主席给我军规定的建军路线，是唯一正确的。人民战士，不论在任何情况下，都要像一九六○年军委扩大会议决议上说的：“高高地举起毛泽东思想的红旗，进一步用毛泽东思想武装全体指战员的头脑，坚持在一切工作中用毛泽东思想挂帅”。
    以后，我们学习毛主席著作抓得更紧了。毛泽东思想胜明灯，云封雾锁看得清。我们班不但在思想革命化上不断前进，而且训练、生产任务也完成得很好，年终还是评上了四好。我们一定要照古田会议决议指出的道路永远走下去，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远忠实于毛主席的建军路线，永远突出政治。
    提倡一个“公”字才能彻底贯彻毛主席的建军路线
    连长徐祖武说：无私才能彻底贯彻“决议”。一九六四年四好总评时，党支部叫我们研究一个问题：“古田会议决议，我们学了三年，为什么还会受到单纯军事观点的影响？”我带着这个问题，重温毛主席这篇光辉著作。毛主席说：“不认识党和红军都是执行革命任务的工具，而自己是其中的一员。不认识自己是革命的主体，以为自己仅仅对长官个人负责任，不是对革命负责任。这种消极的雇佣革命的思想，也是一种个人主义的表现。”读了这段话，我大吃一惊。想想过去，自己怕搞不出“尖子”，难以交代，因而带领侦察班猛攻技术难点，花了不少时间，费了不少脑子，出了不少力气，争得了全军炮兵侦察兵比武的一等奖。技术是“冒尖”了，但是班里的思想问题也成了堆。这那是为革命负责任啊！单纯军事观点是资产阶级的东西，我怀有“雇佣革命”的思想，当然要受它的影响！这次学习使我深刻认识到：无私才能无畏，“私”字当头，必然怕这怕那；只有确立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，做一个无私无畏的人，才能彻底贯彻古田会议决议的精神。要是叫“私”字干扰了自己，即使把古田会议决议背得滚瓜烂熟，也会在两条建军路线斗争中迷失方向。
    五好战士、饲养员宋洪谱说：毛主席教导我们：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”毛主席的话，使我认识到，只为小集体着想，是扩大了的个人主义。要彻底贯彻古田会议决议的精神，必须彻底革命，只有大公无私，才能彻底贯彻古田会议决议的精神。
    坚持革命大节永远贯彻毛主席的建军路线
    副连长汪恒叶说：我们要用毛泽东思想看事。我们连里学习毛主席著作积极分子、班长郭长贵，积极纠正违背古田会议决议的倾向，凡是不突出政治的事，他都要管，他都敢管。可是，有人却说他多嘴多舌，多管闲事。这样说对不对？我们组织大家学习了古田会议决议中的一段话：“关于党内批评问题，还有一点要说及的，就是有些同志的批评不注意大的方面，只注意小的方面。他们不明白批评的主要任务，是指出政治上的错误和组织上的错误。”大家用毛主席的观点一分析，认识到对郭长贵，不能只注意他批评人不大讲方式、场合等小的方面，首先要看他坚持突出政治，给人指出了不突出政治的缺点，这样的“管得宽”好得很。有的说，郭长贵入伍时学了《为人民服务》和古田会议决议，就决心做毛主席的好战士，他常说：“跟毛主席干革命，就要坚决贯彻毛主席的建军路线。”有的说，他不但管别人违背“决议”的事，而且自己就是执行“决议”的模范。大家举了许许多多的事例，都说明郭长贵是一个突出政治的好战士。这次学习，使大家懂得了一个道理：用毛泽东思想来看事，才能分清是非。只要我们照毛主席“党内批评要防止主观武断和把批评庸俗化，说话要有证据，批评要注意政治”的教导去做，我们就能看准问题的本质方面，主流方面，而不被那些非本质方面，非主流方面的东西遮住了眼睛，就能更积极地执行“决议”，更积极地捍卫“决议”，更好地贯彻毛主席的建军路线。
    班长郭长贵说：“管得宽”的精神要提倡，但是不能只满足“管得宽”，还要管得好，才能更好地贯彻“决议”。这就要用毛泽东思想帮人。有个同志嫌当炊事员无声无息，不如搞技术有名有利。我想，他的想法是不符合毛主席建军思想的，但他到炊事班去了，说明他还能服从分配，问题是要提高他对炊事员工作的认识，从这里入手，进一步帮助他突出政治。于是，我就给他讲毛主席的教导：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。又和他一起忆苦。以后他的工作就大变样了，年终被评为五好战士。这件事，使我认识到：我们一心要贯彻毛主席的建军路线，但是因为头脑里毛泽东思想还不多，对毛主席的建军思想领会不深，在贯彻时，就容易出现这样那样不突出政治的问题。这就要用毛泽东思想去帮助同志，提高无产阶级觉悟。以后，我就特别注意用毛泽东思想帮人了。我越帮越深刻地体会到：“管得宽”，就是捍卫毛主席的建军路线，就是宣传毛泽东思想。我决心一辈子为革命“管得宽”，一辈子宣传毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的建军路线。
