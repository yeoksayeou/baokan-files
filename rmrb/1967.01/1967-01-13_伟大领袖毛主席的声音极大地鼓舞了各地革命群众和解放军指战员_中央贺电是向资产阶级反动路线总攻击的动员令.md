The voice of our great leader Chairman Mao has greatly inspired revolutionary masses and soldiers and officers of the PLA across the country. The central telegram is a call to arms for a comprehensive attack on the bourgeois reactionary line.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 12th, revolutionary mass organizations and broad revolutionary masses in the cities of Tianjin, Shenyang, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Chongqing expressed their most enthusiastic support for the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai, the editorial in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, and the emergency notice issued by 32 revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai. They said that the central telegram is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, support, encouragement, and exhortation for the revolutionary rebels, and is a document of great historical significance. The broad revolutionary masses emphasized that the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai have high-held the great red flag of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's personally proposed policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," timely exposed and unmasked the conspiracy of the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and proposed the combat task of opposing revolutionary revisionism and economism. Their revolutionary actions have given us tremendous encouragement and set a brilliant example for us and all revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses in the seven cities decided to learn from the experience of the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, unite under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, implement the great alliance of proletarian revolutionary organizations, repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to victory.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 12th, the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai quickly spread to all frontline positions, border outposts, air force bases, naval docks, and military camps of the People's Liberation Army. The broad soldiers and officers were excited and jubilant, with shouts of "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" echoing throughout the army, along with the song "The Great Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsman." The soldiers and officers excitedly said that the central telegram made us hear the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao. We enthusiastically cheer, enthusiastically support, and resolutely respond, determined to learn from the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and pledge to be a strong backbone for the revolutionary left, together with the revolutionary masses across the country, resolutely smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to victory.

	Soldiers and officers in Kunming, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Beijing, and other units, as well as the navy, air force, and military regions of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet, were extremely moved after hearing the telegram and the editorial "Oppose Economism, Smash the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" published in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine, as well as the emergency notice issued by the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and 31 other revolutionary mass organizations. Some listened over and over again until late at night. When the newspapers carrying the central telegram and the other two documents arrived at various units, the soldiers and officers eagerly read them and held lively discussions. Soldiers and officers of the Red One Company, who had once served as guards for Chairman Mao, said that the central telegram is the order to attack the bourgeois reactionary line issued by our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. These three documents greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary masses and all revolutionary people, and greatly dampened the spirits of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, the stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line, and all class enemies. We cheer a thousand times and support a million times. The soldiers and officers of the "Red Vanguard Company" said that the central telegram is the strongest support, deepest concern, and greatest encouragement from our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao to the revolutionary masses in Shanghai, and also to all revolutionary masses across the country. The telegram, editorial, emergency notice, and "Letter to All People of Shanghai" are a clarion call, summoning the revolutionary people across the country to take action together, smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad soldiers and officers said in the discussion that our great leader Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, relies on the masses the most, respects the revolutionary masses' pioneering spirit the most, and is best at discovering and most resolutely supporting new things. Everyone couldn't help but shout "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" over and over again.

	Soldiers and officers in Nanjing, Fuzhou, Chengdu, Jinan, Shenyang, Lanzhou, and other units, as well as the railway troops and artillery troops, highly praised the "Letter to All People of Shanghai" and the emergency notice issued by various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai as important documents of high-level Marxism-Leninism, and a concrete manifestation of the combination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses. The soldiers and officers said that these two important documents made the revolutionary people jubilant and applauding, while making the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the stubborn elements insisting on the bourgeois reactionary line tremble with fear and lose their composure.

	The soldiers and officers of various units unanimously expressed that whatever Chairman Mao advocates, we firmly support and firmly implement. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will firmly rebel against them and fight to the end. We enthusiastically respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, learn from the revolutionary spirit and actions of the Shanghai revolutionary rebels, learn from their high-holding of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and their unlimited loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, learn from their clear and firm proletarian revolutionary stance, learn from their courage in defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The soldiers and officers decided to stand with the broad revolutionary masses, hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, and under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct revolutionary line, resolutely smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and achieve new and greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
