The bloody incident of the Soviet revisionist leadership group's suppression of our students passing through Moscow has aroused the extreme indignation and strong protests of the workers of the capital. Upon hearing the news, revolutionary rebels from several factories held a protest rally at the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory. They expressed their righteous indignation and denounced the Soviet revisionists' savage, fascist atrocity.

Shao Shizhou of the "Red Rebels" of the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory spoke first at the meeting. He said:

The Soviet revisionists beating our young students is a serious provocation against the great Chinese people. This was clearly premeditated and is another piece of evidence of the Soviet revisionists' frenzied anti-China actions. We, the workers of China, strongly protest against this gang of traitors and scabs! We express our deepest sympathies and revolutionary greetings to our students who are bravely fighting against the Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocities! Our young students passed through Moscow to lay a wreath at the mausoleum of the revolutionary leader Lenin. Why were they brutally beaten? This small clique of traitors and scabs does not allow us to honor Lenin. The Soviet Union, which Lenin founded as the world's first socialist state, has now been ruined by this gang of traitors!

Jia Zhengwen of the "Red Rebels" of the Beijing Crane Factory said:

Lenin is the teacher of the world's people. Our students passing through Moscow to lay a wreath at Lenin's mausoleum is a revolutionary act. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao is also the teacher of all revolutionary people in the world. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism in our time. Reading Chairman Mao's quotations is the honor and right of every Chinese person. No one can take away our right to read Chairman Mao's books!

Our 69 young students are great! They are young warriors nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Under the assault and beating of the Soviet military police and thugs, they fearlessly faced bloodshed and sacrifice. On Red Square, they shouted, "Down with modern revisionism!" This is the death knell for this gang of traitors!

The Soviet revisionists extremely hate Mao Zedong Thought and extremely hate our proletarian cultural revolution. This is because they are extremely afraid of the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought and extremely afraid of the great influence of our cultural revolution. They are afraid that the Soviet people will rise up against them.

The Soviet revisionist leaders, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, are frenziedly anti-China, betraying the interests of the people of the world, and becoming traitors to the Soviet people and all the people of the world. They are like rabbits with long tails—it won't last! One day, the revolutionary rebels and the people of the Soviet Union will rise up and thoroughly expose them, overthrow these Soviet revisionist bourgeois masters, and make sure they never rise again!

Zhao Cunyi of the "Red Rebels" of the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory said:

We strongly demand that the Soviet revisionist authorities must admit their guilt, severely punish the culprits who beat our young students, and publicly apologize to our students! We will not let them off easily. We must expose these extremely evil Soviet revisionists to the world!

Lv Jiacai of the "Red Rebels" of the First Machine Tool Factory said:

The Chinese working class strongly protests against the Soviet revisionists' savage, fascist atrocity! They slander our great leader Chairman Mao, they beat our students, and we, the Chinese people, will never accept this! The Soviet revisionists' anti-China actions are becoming more and more arrogant. They have already committed heinous crimes against the Chinese people. Today's blood debt, we will definitely remember and settle accounts with them!

The Soviet revisionists' fascist atrocity proves that capitalism has been restored in the Soviet Union. Capitalism and socialism, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, are of course incompatible. We are carrying out the cultural revolution to uproot revisionism, which has frightened the Soviet revisionists. The Soviet revisionists' frenzied anti-China actions are determined by their reactionary class nature.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reactionaries of all countries always 'lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet.'" The Soviet revisionists so blatantly suppressing Chinese students will only make the revolutionary people of the world more clearly see the despicable face of revisionism and more firmly resolve to carry the cultural revolution to the end. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao, follow the Party Central Committee, and thoroughly carry out the revolution. We must give the Soviet revisionists a resolute rebuff!

Li Dehuai of the "East is Red" Commune of the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Mill said:

The Soviet revisionists' creation of this bloody incident is not accidental. They hate our cultural revolution and the great Mao Zedong Thought to the core. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We are revolutionary rebel workers by Chairman Mao's side. We listen to Chairman Mao the most. We must carry out the cultural revolution thoroughly and deeply, so that the proletarian state of our motherland will never change color.

We warn the Soviet revisionists: the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Soviet leaders, listen up: we will not only rebel against the counter-revolutionary revisionists in China, but also thoroughly rebel against revisionism and imperialism in the world. Down with imperialism! Down with modern revisionism!

Jin Xiaokuo of the "Red Rebels" of the First Machine Tool Factory said:

The blood debt owed by the Soviet revisionists has aroused the greatest indignation of revolutionary workers. Old and new grievances, this account must be settled. We warn a small clique of Soviet revisionist bad guys: what you are doing will not save your fate, but will only hasten your doom! Chairman Mao's book is a brilliant revolutionary treasure. The Soviet revisionists are so afraid of Mao Zedong Thought precisely because they know that wherever there is Mao Zedong Thought, the people will rise up and struggle. With Mao Zedong Thought, we defeated Japanese imperialism, defeated Chiang Kai-shek, and defeated U.S. imperialism; with Mao Zedong Thought, we have achieved great successes in the past 17 years since the founding of the nation, successfully conducted nuclear tests; with Mao Zedong Thought, we have launched a cultural revolution that shakes the world. The Soviet revisionists want to be anti-China, but they are like "ants trying to shake a big tree." We must resolutely defend Mao Zedong Thought. We will follow Chairman Mao to make the revolution, and no force can shake our resolve!

Liu Jingkuan of the "Red Rebels" of the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory said:

Hearing this news, I am very excited and extremely indignant. The Soviet revisionists are frenziedly suppressing the revolution when they are about to perish. In the past, they still waved the banner of Leninism, but now, they actually beat Chinese students who laid a wreath at Lenin's mausoleum, showing that the Soviet revisionists' mask has been completely torn off.

Chairman Mao teaches us that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. The Soviet revisionists are paper tigers. They are just transient guests in history and will soon be crushed by the wheels of history! We firmly believe that the Soviet Union has hope. In the near future, Moscow will definitely see the Soviet red rebels. The future of the Soviet Union belongs to the Soviet people and the Soviet red rebels! We believe that the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union is indestructible!

The rally ended with the workers shouting slogans: "Workers of the world, unite!" "People of the world, unite!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Down with all reactionaries!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao!"

　　首都革命工人集会愤怒声讨苏修集团镇压我留学生的血腥罪行
　　革命造反派一定要大造苏修集团的反
    本报讯　苏联修正主义领导集团血腥镇压途经莫斯科的我国留学生的流血事件，激起了首都工人的无比愤怒和强烈抗议。消息传来，一些工厂的革命造反派工人，在北京第一机床厂举行了抗议集会。他们怀着满腔义愤，声讨苏修这一野蛮的法西斯暴行。
    北京第一机床厂“红色造反者”邵世洲在会上首先发言。他说：
    苏修打伤我国的青年学生，这是对伟大中国人民的严重挑衅。这完全是预谋好了的，是苏修疯狂反华的又一个罪证。我们中国的工人向苏修这一伙叛徒和工贼提出最最强烈的抗议！我们向同苏修法西斯暴行展开英勇斗争的我国留学生表示最亲切的慰问，并致以革命的敬礼！我们的青年学生经过莫斯科，向革命导师列宁墓献花圈，为什么要惨遭毒打？苏修这一小撮叛徒和工贼，不许我们敬仰列宁。苏联是列宁缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家，现在竟然被这一伙叛徒糟蹋成了这个样子！
    北京起重机厂“红色造反者”贾政文说：
    列宁是世界人民的导师，我国留学生经过莫斯科前往列宁墓献花圈，这完全是革命的行动。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，也是全世界革命人民的导师，毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的顶峰。朗读毛主席语录，是我们每一个中国人的光荣权利。谁也不能剥夺我们读毛主席书的权利！
    我们的六十九位青年学生是好样的！他们是毛泽东思想哺育成长的年青战士。他们在苏修军警和暴徒的围攻和毒打之下，不怕流血牺牲，在红场上喊出了“打倒现代修正主义”的口号，这是苏修这一伙叛徒的丧钟！
    苏修极端仇视毛泽东思想，极端仇视我国的无产阶级文化大革命，就是因为他们极端害怕毛泽东思想的巨大影响，害怕我国的文化大革命的巨大影响，就是怕苏联人民起来造他们的反。
    苏修的头目们，勾结美帝，疯狂反华，出卖世界人民的利益，成为苏联人民和全世界人民的叛徒。他们是兔子尾巴长不了！总有一天，苏联的革命造反派，苏联人民，会起来大造他们的反，要把这帮苏修资产阶级老爷们打翻在地，再踏上一脚，叫他们永世不得翻身！
    北京光华木材厂“红色造反者”赵存义说：
    我们强烈要求苏修当局必须低头认罪，必须严惩打伤我国青年学生的凶手，必须公开地向我国学生赔礼道歉！我们绝不会轻易放过他们，一定要把罪大恶极的苏修揪出来，在全世界人民面前示众！
    第一机床厂“红色造反者”吕嘉才说：
    我们中国工人阶级对苏修这一野蛮的法西斯暴行表示最最强烈的抗议！他们污蔑我们的伟大领袖毛主席，他们殴打我们的留学生，我们中国人民一千个不答应！一万个不答应！苏修反华言行越来越嚣张了，它早已对我们中国人民犯下了滔天罪行。今天的这笔血债，我们也一定要记在心上，要跟它彻底清算！
    苏修的法西斯暴行证明，在苏联，资本主义已经复辟了。资本主义和社会主义，资产阶级和无产阶级，当然是水火不相容的。我们搞文化大革命，挖修正主义的根子，使苏修吓破了胆。苏修疯狂反华，是它的反动阶级本性决定的。
    毛主席教导说：各国反动派总是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。苏修这样明目张胆地镇压中国学生，只会使全世界革命人民更进一步认清修正主义的卑鄙面目，也更坚定了我们把文化大革命进行到底的决心。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，跟着毛主席，跟着党中央，彻底闹革命。我们必须给苏修以坚决的回击！
    北京国棉一厂“东方红”公社李德怀说：
    苏修制造这次流血事件，决不是偶然的。他们对我国的文化大革命和伟大的毛泽东思想恨之入骨。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们是毛主席身边的革命造反派工人，我们最听毛主席的话。我们一定要把文化大革命搞深、搞彻底，让祖国无产阶级的江山永不变色。
    我们要警告苏修，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，决不是好惹的。苏修头子们听着：我们不但要造中国反革命修正主义分子的反，也要大造世界上修正主义的反，大造帝国主义的反。打倒帝国主义！打倒现代修正主义！
    第一机床厂“红色造反者”金效中说：
    苏修欠下的这笔血债，激起了我们革命工人最大的愤慨。新仇旧恨，这笔账总要清算的。我们要正告一小撮苏修坏家伙，你们这样干，决挽救不了自己的命运，只会加速你们的灭亡！毛主席的书是光芒万丈的革命宝书。苏修那么害怕毛泽东思想，正是因为他们知道，哪里有了毛泽东思想，哪里的人民就会起来造反，起来斗争。有了毛泽东思想，我们打败了日本帝国主义，打败了蒋介石，打败了美帝国主义；有了毛泽东思想，我们建国十七年来取得了伟大成就，成功地进行了核试验；有了毛泽东思想，我们开展了震撼全世界的文化大革命。苏修要反华，是“蚍蜉撼大树”。我们一定要坚决捍卫毛泽东思想。我们跟着毛主席闹革命是闹定了，任何力量也动摇不了我们的决心！
    北京光华木材厂“红色造反者”刘景宽说：
    听到这个消息，我非常激动，万分气愤。苏修疯狂镇压革命之时，就是它快要灭亡之日。它过去还打着列宁主义的旗号，现在，居然殴打向列宁墓献花圈的中国学生，说明苏修的画皮已经完全撕下来了。
    毛主席教导我们，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。苏修就是纸老虎。它不过是历史上匆匆来去的过客，不久就会被历史的车轮辗得粉碎！我们坚决相信，苏联是有希望的。不久的将来，莫斯科一定会出现苏联的红色造反派。苏联的未来属于苏联人民，属于苏联的红色造反派！我们相信，中苏两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的！
    抗议集会结束时，工人们高呼口号：“全世界无产者联合起来！”“全世界人民联合起来！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”“打倒各国反动派！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
