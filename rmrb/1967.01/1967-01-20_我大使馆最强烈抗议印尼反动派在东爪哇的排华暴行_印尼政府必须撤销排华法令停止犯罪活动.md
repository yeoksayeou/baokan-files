The Chinese Embassy strongly protests the reactionary actions of Indonesian authorities in East Java. The Indonesian government must revoke the anti-Chinese decrees and stop criminal activities.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 19th, a message was sent by the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 17th. The message strongly protested the recent serious incidents of rampant anti-Chinese activities launched by the military and political authorities in East Java and demanded that the Indonesian government immediately take measures to stop all criminal activities that infringe upon the legitimate rights and properties of the Chinese community.

The message stated that on December 31, 1966, the commander of the Eighth Military Region of Indonesia, Sumitro, issued four anti-Chinese decrees on behalf of the East Java authorities. The main contents of these decrees are:

1. Arbitrarily prohibiting Chinese nationals from operating wholesale businesses in all regions of East Java and from operating wholesale businesses outside Surabaya in other parts of East Java;
2. Irrationally prohibiting Chinese nationals from relocating within East Java;
3. Forcibly imposing a "special obligation tax" on every Chinese national residing in East Java, with the tax amount for 1966 reaching 2,500 new rupiah;
4. Ruthlessly depriving Chinese nationals of the right to use the Chinese language and script in economic, financial, administrative, and telecommunications activities within East Java.

The message pointed out that after the issuance of the above decrees, a large-scale campaign to destroy the Chinese community's economy and plunder their assets is underway throughout East Java. The local authorities have ordered relevant Chinese businessmen to sell their inventory within a specified period, with the proceeds to be deposited in banks. Military and political authorities in various places are forcibly revoking the business licenses of the Chinese community, ordering them to inventory and report their goods, with some places deploying hundreds of military police in a single day to force the Chinese community to inventory their goods; some places are further registering the entire assets of the Chinese community; some places have announced that starting from February 1, 1967, they will "take over" Chinese-owned shops, even seizing inventory and business equipment. The vast majority of innocent Chinese nationals are facing a plundering disaster.

The message pointed out that it is clear that the purpose of issuing the above four anti-Chinese decrees is to launch a savage and comprehensive attack and sudden assault on all Chinese nationals in East Java, attempting to eliminate their legitimate businesses, plunder their assets, and reduce them to poverty and destitution, while also restricting their freedom of residence and movement and isolating them from their cultural ties with their homeland, thereby placing them in a desperate situation. The right-wing military mayor of Malang openly stated in a New Year's radio broadcast that these four decrees aim to "uproot" the Chinese community. This exposes the evil plot of the Indonesian ruling clique. The Chinese Embassy asks the Indonesian government: Is this not exposing the lies of your cabinet's repeated hypocritical propaganda that "the Indonesian government is responsible for protecting the property and safety of Chinese nationals within the country"? Where in the world is there a government like yours that blatantly and horrifyingly violates international norms and relevant treaties and agreements between the two countries, infringing upon the legitimate rights of nationals from a country with which you have diplomatic relations to such an extent!

The message emphasized that the above four measures in the East Java region are extremely hostile to the People's Republic of China, exacerbating anti-Chinese sentiment, and further deteriorating relations between the two countries. The embassy expresses great indignation and strongly protests these actions, demanding that the Indonesian government immediately revoke the anti-Chinese decrees in East Java and stop all criminal activities that infringe upon the legitimate rights and properties of the Chinese community. The embassy reserves the right to make further demands on this matter.

The Chinese Embassy once again warns the Indonesian government: Your anti-Chinese plot to arbitrarily violate international law is not only a serious infringement upon the legitimate rights of the Chinese community but also greatly harms the interests of the Indonesian people. It is doomed to be exposed and thoroughly defeated by the broad masses of the Indonesian people.

    我大使馆最强烈抗议印尼反动派在东爪哇的排华暴行
    印尼政府必须撤销排华法令停止犯罪活动
    据新华社十九日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十七日照会印度尼西亚外交部，就东爪哇军政当局最近发动新的猖狂的排华活动的严重事件，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议，并严正要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取措施，停止侵犯华侨正当权益和合法财产的一切犯罪活动。
    照会说，一九六六年十二月三十一日，印度尼西亚第八军区司令苏米特洛以东爪哇地方掌权者名义，同时发布了四项反华、排华的“决定书”，其主要内容是：
    一、悍然禁止中华人民共和国侨民在东爪哇所有地区经营大批发商，和在泗水以外的其他东爪哇地区经营批发商；
    二、无理禁止中华人民共和国侨民在东爪哇境内迁移住地；
    三、强行规定居住在东爪哇的每一个中华人民共和国的侨民必须缴纳一种“特别义务捐”，一九六六年度的税额高达新币二千五百盾；
    四、横蛮剥夺中华人民共和国侨民在东爪哇境内进行经济、财政、行政和电讯通信方面的活动中使用中国语言和文字的权利。
    照会指出，在上述“决定书”发布后，东爪哇全境正在展开一个大规模摧残华侨经济和掠夺华侨资产的疯狂行动。东爪哇地方掌权者已通令有关华侨商人，限期出售存货，所得款项必须存入银行。各地军政当局都在强行吊销华侨的营业执照，勒令他们清点和呈报存货，有的地方在一天内竟出动了数百名军警强迫华侨清点物资；有的地方进而登记华侨全部财产；有的地方宣布自一九六七年二月一日起就要“接管”华侨商店，甚至还接收存货和营业设备。广大无辜华侨正面临着一场盗匪式的大浩劫。
    照会指出，十分明显，发布上述四项反华、排华的“决定书”的目的，是对东爪哇全体华侨实行一次最野蛮的全面进攻和突然袭击，妄图通过取缔华侨的正当经营，掠夺华侨的资产，使他们倾家荡产，生计断绝，同时又限制他们居住和行动的自由，隔绝他们和祖国文化上的联系，以此置他们于绝境。玛琅市的右派军人市长在电台发表的新年广播贺词中公然说，这四项“决定书”是要把华侨连根拔掉。这就和盘托出了印度尼西亚统治集团这一恶毒的阴谋。中国大使馆要质问印度尼西亚政府：这样岂不是把你们内阁主席团一再虚伪宣传的所谓“印度尼西亚政府有责任保护国内华侨财产和生命的安全”的谎言，全部拆穿了吗？世界上哪里有一个像你们这样的政府，公然践踏国际关系准则和两国的有关条约与协定，侵犯一个建交国家的侨民正当权益到如此明目张胆和骇人听闻的地步！？
    照会强调指出，上述东爪哇地区的四项措施，是极端敌视中华人民共和国、加剧反华、排华，并进一步恶化两国关系的新的严重步骤。大使馆对此表示极大愤慨，特向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议，并严正要求印度尼西亚政府立即撤销东爪哇的这些排华法令，停止侵犯华侨正当权益和合法财产的一切犯罪活动。大使馆就此保留进一步提出要求的权利。
    中国大使馆在照会中再一次正告印度尼西亚政府：你们这种恣意破坏国际法准则的反华、排华阴谋，不仅严重侵犯了华侨的正当权益，同时也极大地危害了印度尼西亚人民的利益，是注定要被印度尼西亚广大人民所识破并且遭到彻底破产的。
