Revolutionaries Should Always Consult the Treasure Book
The Pakistani People Love the "Quotations from Chairman Mao"

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Rawalpindi, Pakistani friends highly value the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," hailing this treasure book as "indispensable for all revolutionaries."

A Pakistani journalist, after reading the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," said, "Every revolutionary fighting against imperialism and colonialism must always carry the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' and study it, consulting it at all times. Because this treasure book is an inexhaustible source of the common spiritual wealth of all revolutionaries in the world."

He said, Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of all oppressed peoples in the world.

He said, Mao Zedong Thought is guiding all revolutionary movements in the world. Mao Zedong Thought gives all revolutionaries unlimited courage and wisdom, inspiring them to continue fighting until they achieve final victory.

A university student in Rawalpindi, who only recently obtained a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," can now recite many aphorisms from it and often quotes them in conversations with friends.

A social worker in Rawalpindi, after finally obtaining a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which he had long desired, held this shining red treasure book tightly to his chest and joyfully said, "I have obtained the most precious book." After reading the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he wrote in a letter, "This book concisely and scientifically solves all the problems of the contemporary revolutionary movement, and even those with little education can easily understand it."

A worker in Lahore said, "I firmly believe in the great Mao Zedong Thought, just as I believe the red sun will always rise from the east. All of China's great achievements are due to the guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong. Once the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they will surely raise the banner of liberation and win victory. American imperialism and Soviet revisionism will surely be eliminated from the face of the earth."

    革命者要随时向宝书请教
    巴基斯坦人民热爱《毛主席语录》
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第电　巴基斯坦朋友十分珍视《毛主席语录》，欢呼这本宝书是“一切革命者不可缺少的”。
    一位巴基斯坦新闻工作者在读了《毛主席语录》之后说，“每一个正在同帝国主义和殖民主义进行斗争的革命者，必须经常把《毛主席语录》带在身边学习它，随时向它求教。因为这本宝书是世界上一切革命者共同精神财富的取之不尽的源泉。”
    他说，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界一切被压迫人民的伟大领袖。
    他说，毛泽东思想正在指导着世界上一切革命运动。毛泽东思想给予一切革命者以无限的勇气和智慧，鼓舞他们继续战斗，直到取得最后胜利。
    拉瓦尔品第的一名大学生，几天前才得到了一本《毛主席语录》，但他现在已经能够背诵《毛主席语录》中的许多警句，并且在同朋友交谈时，引用这些警句。
    拉瓦尔品第的一个社会工作者在得到一本他渴望已久的《毛主席语录》后，把这本红光闪闪的宝书紧紧地放在胸前，欣喜地说，“我得到了最宝贵的一本书”。在读了《毛主席语录》之后，他在一封信里写道，这本书“简明扼要地、科学地解决了当代革命运动中的一切问题，甚至文化程度不高的人也很容易看懂。”
    莱雅普尔的一位工人说：“我坚信伟大的毛泽东思想，正像我相信红太阳永远从东方升起一样。中国的一切伟大成就都是由于有了毛泽东主席的教导。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲一切被压迫的人民一旦用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来，一定会高举解放红旗并赢得胜利，美帝国主义和苏联修正主义一定会在地球上消灭。”
