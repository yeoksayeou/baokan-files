“I have seen Chairman Mao, shaken hands with Chairman Mao, and we have received the eagerly awaited red book, the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao.' My heart has been filled with excitement because these are great events in my life!”

The leader of the Congolese (Brazzaville) Friendship Delegation to China, Kousakana, on the eve of concluding his visit to China, spoke with deep affection to Chinese friends about his love for our great leader Chairman Mao and his admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. The following is a summary of Kousakana's remarks:

On the evening of November 2, 1966, Chinese comrades informed our delegation that Chairman Mao would review the parade the next day on Tiananmen Square, and I was also invited to attend. That night, I eagerly awaited the moment, wishing it would come quickly. The next morning, I ascended Tiananmen. I saw rows of formations solemnly gathering on Tiananmen Square, each person holding a little red book, shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao!” “Long live Chairman Mao!” The enthusiasm of the crowd for Chairman Mao was truly indescribable.

Soon, Chairman Mao appeared on the Tiananmen rostrum. I saw Chairman Mao, and I thought, how wonderful it would be to meet and shake hands with Chairman Mao! After several hours, suddenly, someone told me that Chairman Mao wanted to see me, and I was overjoyed. I finally met Chairman Mao and shook his warm hand. It is this hand that has written so many books, transforming old China into today's China, and mobilizing the ideological consciousness of 700 million Chinese people. Chairman Mao and I took a photo together, and my joy reached its peak. That day, Chairman Mao passed by us many times, and each time I felt I could not see enough, my heart was always filled with excitement. That afternoon, when I returned to the hotel, I was very tired, but I was still excitedly telling my comrades in the delegation about the great joy of shaking hands with Chairman Mao and taking a photo with him.

We discussed with the comrades the little red book that the parade participants were holding, guessing what kind of book it was and how it could inspire such great enthusiasm among the people.

Later, we visited various places in China, met with Red Guards and people from all walks of life, and saw that they all carried the little red book, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. We saw the achievements of the Chinese people in various fields during our visits to different places. We visited a commune and saw how the commune members had greened the bare hills; we saw various new machines being manufactured in the factories. People said that these achievements were all thanks to Mao Zedong Thought. When people encountered difficulties, they also relied on Mao Zedong Thought to arm themselves and overcome them. Mao Zedong Thought had become a tremendous material force. Hearing this, we wanted to read this little red book, the “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” even more.

Chinese comrades finally presented us with the French translation of the “Quotations from Chairman Mao.” We immediately opened it and read it all night. We discovered the truth within it. We found that no matter what problem we encountered, we could find the answer in this little red book.

We have been searching for such a theory to make our country advance. We have read many books, but we have not found it. During the Cultural Revolution in China, we came to China, and we finally found this treasure book. The thoughts we have been seeking are all in Chairman Mao's book. We also understand why the Chinese people love Chairman Mao so much.

Imperialism is very afraid of our friendship with China and fears that Congolese people will come to China, fearing that our visit to China will strengthen our ideological armament. However, with the principles explained in the “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” we will definitely be able to recognize our friends and our enemies.

The Chinese people highly value Mao Zedong Thought. We will also first read Chairman Mao's books, understand them, and then let the people of Congo (Brazzaville) understand the principles within.

　　读了红宝书更加热爱毛主席
　　刚果（布）友好代表团团长说《毛主席语录》是真理的宝库
    新华社二十日讯　“我见到了毛主席，和毛主席握了手，我们还得到了急切盼望的红书《毛主席语录》。我的心情一直很激动，因为这些都是我一生中的大事呵！”
    来到我国的刚果（布）友好访华代表团团长库萨卡纳，在结束访问中国的前夕，怀着深厚友情，向中国朋友谈了他对我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱和对毛泽东思想的敬仰。下面就是库萨卡纳谈话的摘要：
    一九六六年十一月二日晚，中国同志告诉我们代表团说，毛主席将在明天在天安门检阅游行队伍，我也被邀请出席观礼。这一夜我焦急地等待着，恨不能很快就去。次日一清早我登上了天安门。只见一行行的队伍庄严地聚集在天安门广场，每个人手里举着一本小红书，高喊着：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”人群中迸发出来的那种对毛主席的热情，真是难以用言语形容的。
    不久毛主席出现在天安门城楼上。我见到了毛主席，我心里想，能和毛主席见面握手该多好！过了好几个小时以后，突然，人们告诉我说，毛主席愿意见到我，我高兴得不知所措。我终于见到了毛主席，握了他温暖的手。就是这只手写成了好多书，把旧中国改变成今天的中国，把七亿中国人民从思想上动员起来。毛主席和我一起拍了照，我的喜悦达到了顶点。这一天，毛主席在我们面前经过好多次，每一次我都觉得看不够，我的心情一直很激动。当天下午回到旅馆的时候，已经很累了，但我依然兴奋地把毛主席和我握手、合影的大喜事，告诉了我们代表团的同志们。
    我们和同志们谈到了游行群众手中拿着的那本“红书”，大家猜想着这是一本什么书，它是怎样激发起群众这么大的热情。
    以后，我们到中国各地参观访问，会见了红卫兵和各界群众，见到他们都带着那本“红书”，热情洋溢地称颂毛主席和毛泽东思想。我们在各地看到中国人民在各方面取得的成就。我们参观了一个公社，看到社员们怎样把一座座光秃秃的山丘都绿化了；我们看到工厂里制造的各种新的机器。人们说，这些成就的取得全都是靠了毛泽东思想。人们遇到了困难，也是靠毛泽东思想武装自己去克服，毛泽东思想已经变成了巨大的物质力量。听了这些，使我们更想读这本红书——《毛主席语录》。
    中国同志终于把《毛主席语录》法文译本赠给了我们。我们当即打开来，一看就看了一夜。我们从中发现了真理。我们发现不管有什么问题，都可以从这本“红书”中找到答案。
    我们一直在摸索、寻找这样的理论：怎样使我们的国家前进。我们读了好多书，但没有找到。在中国文化大革命热火朝天的时候，我们到中国来了，我们终于找到这本宝书。我们所要寻找的思想已经在毛主席的书里找到了。我们也理解了中国人民为什么如此热爱毛主席。
    帝国主义很害怕我们和中国友好，害怕我们刚果人到中国来，害怕我们到中国的访问会加强思想上的武装。但是，有了《毛主席语录》阐明的道理，我们一定能够认清我们的朋友和我们的敌人。
    中国人民十分珍视毛泽东思想。我们也一定要首先读毛主席的书，去理解它，然后也让刚果（布）人民懂得其中的道理。
