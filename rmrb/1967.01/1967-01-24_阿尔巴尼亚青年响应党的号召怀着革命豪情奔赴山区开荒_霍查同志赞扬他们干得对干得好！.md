Albanian youth, responding to the party's call, have rushed to the mountainous regions with revolutionary fervor to reclaim wasteland. Comrade Enver Hoxha praises them for doing the right thing and doing it well!

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 22nd: Comrade Enver Hoxha on the 21st received representatives of youth volunteers who participated in the mountainous region reclamation at the Party Central Committee building.

During the reception, the representatives reported to Comrade Hoxha about the revolutionary youth's labor and life in the mountainous regions. He praised the youth for their heroic and tenacious labor in implementing the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor and wished them further achievements in their labor.

Comrade Hoxha presented a porcelain relief of Ouyang Hai, which was given to him by the Chinese Communist Party delegation attending the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor last year, to the outstanding production team in this labor effort—the Ferri District Youth Production Team.

Present at the reception were: Member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, Kafër Spasiu, and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Youth League, Ekrem Meri, among others.

Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, January 23rd: Over 14,000 young people across Albania have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha to "go to the mountains and make the mountains as fertile as the plains." Over the past two months, they have launched an unprecedented mass movement to go up the mountains to reclaim wasteland. Through labor, they have received a profound education in socialism and patriotism.

Shortly after the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor concluded, the youth of the Albania-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in Laparohaja, Berat District, were the first to propose the revolutionary initiative to go to the mountains to reclaim wasteland. This initiative was immediately enthusiastically supported by the urban and rural youth of Shkodër and Korçë districts. Currently, over 14,000 male and female youth have gone up the mountains to reclaim wasteland.

With revolutionary spirit, the youth rushed to the mountainous regions, turning many barren hills into terraced fields. Many youth have helped local cooperatives complete over 50% of their annual reclamation plans.

The reclamation movement over the past two months has become a revolutionary school for training the younger generation. The 180 youth in the Durres District, named after the great communist warrior Reka, have expressed their determination to learn the heroic communist spirit in their labor.

Recently, 350 representatives of the over 14,000 youth who went up the mountains to reclaim wasteland gathered in Tirana to report their work to the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor and expressed their determination to further improve their labor training.

At the meeting, the Central Committee of the Albanian Youth League awarded a red banner to the outstanding youth of Berat District in this reclamation movement. The conference also passed a telegram of respect to the Party Central Committee, expressing their determination to follow the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor and the teachings of Comrade Hoxha to complete the tasks of the Fourth Five-Year Plan.

    阿尔巴尼亚青年响应党的号召怀着革命豪情奔赴山区开荒
　　霍查同志赞扬他们干得对干得好！
    新华社地拉那二十二日电　恩维尔·霍查同志二十一日在党中央大厦接见了参加山区开荒的义务劳动青年代表。
    接见时，代表们向霍查同志报告了革命青年在山区劳动和生活的情况。他赞扬青年们为实现阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的决议而进行的英勇顽强的劳动，并祝他们在劳动中取得进一步的成就。
    霍查同志把去年参加阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的中国共产党代表团送给他的一幅欧阳海瓷浮雕像转赠给在这次劳动中的优秀生产队——费里区青年生产队。
    接见时在座的有：阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央书记处书记查费尔·斯巴修和阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央第一书记艾基姆·梅罗等。
    新华社地拉那二十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚全国一万四千多名青年热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和恩维尔·霍查同志关于“到山区去，把山区变得像平原那样富饶”的号召，两个多月来，展开了一个规模空前的群众性的上山开荒运动。他们通过劳动，受到了一次深刻的社会主义和爱国主义教育。
    早在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会刚刚结束的时候，培拉特区拉帕罗哈加阿中友好农业社的青年们首先提出到山区开荒的革命倡议。这个倡议立刻得到了斯库台和科尔察等区城乡青年的热烈响应。目前，已有一万四千多名男女青年上山开荒。
    青年们怀着革命的豪情奔向山区，把许多荒山秃岭开成一排排的梯田。许多青年帮助当地合作社完成了年度开荒计划的百分之五十以上。
    两个多月来的开荒运动变成了锻炼青年一代的革命学校。都拉斯区一百八十名青年组成的生产队以一心为公的伟大共产主义战士雷卡的名字命名，并表示要在劳动中学习英雄的共产主义精神。
    阿尔巴尼亚全国一万四千多名上山开荒青年的三百五十名代表最近在地拉那集会，向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央汇报了他们的工作，并表示进一步搞好劳动锻炼的决心。
    会上，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央把一面流动红旗授予在这次开荒运动中表现突出的培拉特区青年。大会并通过向党中央的致敬电，表示决心遵循阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的决议和霍查同志的教导，完成第四个五年计划的任务。（附图片）
