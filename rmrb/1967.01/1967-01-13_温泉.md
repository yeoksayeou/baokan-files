At the foot of the 3,400-meter-high Que'er Mountain, there is a hot spring. Travelers going to and from the Sichuan-Tibet Plateau come here to bathe, washing away the dust and fatigue of their journey, feeling warm and comfortable all over. However, what is even warmer than the hot spring is the Ganzi Military Supply Station located at the foot of the mountain by the Yalong River.

The Ganzi Military Supply Station has become a warm current on the snowy plateau because the comrades at the station have a warm current of serving the people in their hearts.

When the supply station was first established, obtaining water was extremely difficult. They had to walk up and down a 40-degree slope to fetch water from the Yalong River, which was 200 meters away. They didn't mind the hard work, but what bothered them was the inconvenience caused to the truck drivers. Every day, the truck drivers came to the station to add water to their vehicles and wash them, also having to fetch water from the river. In the bitter cold of winter, the water buckets became heavier with each trip, but the amount of water fetched became less. Some comrades, to avoid causing trouble for the supply station, even went to the river to wash their faces. The fatigue of the truck drivers weighed heavily on the hearts of the supply station comrades. They thought, "We study 'In Service of the People' every day and shout about serving the people wholeheartedly and thoroughly. How can we let the truck drivers, who have been traveling all day, work so hard at our station? This cannot go on." The Party branch decided to bring water into the station. Thus, a fierce battle to secure water began. The cadres led the way, and everyone swung their picks and shovels. Although it was winter, Que'er Mountain was hot and bustling. In just a few days, they dug a water channel, bringing water from a river two kilometers away in the snow-covered mountains into the supply station. The gurgling stream flowed into the station, nourishing the hearts of the passing comrades. The drivers no longer had to take the "wrong" route, and their faces were filled with satisfied smiles, their joy unending. The convenience of water for vehicles and the satisfaction of the drivers were achieved, but the comrades at the supply station were considering another problem: The supply station is a home for countless passing comrades. Not only should the water for vehicles be convenient, but all passing personnel should also find it convenient to drink water, wash their faces, and bathe!

The deputy head of the mess hall, Lü Runhua, was constantly thinking about how to bring water to the kitchen, the boiling water room, and the washroom. He spent a lot of effort designing a water wheel, but after several failed attempts, he was transferred away. The unfinished work of the deputy head weighed heavily on the heart of the head of the mess hall, Mi Tongsheng. The leadership encouraged him, and his comrades also helped him brainstorm. He felt that whether or not he could complete the water wheel was a test of his "wholeheartedly serving the people" ideology. He opened "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and repeatedly studied "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory." With Chairman Mao's teachings in his heart, he had boundless energy. With the spirit of the Foolish Old Man moving mountains, he worked tirelessly on the design, getting up early and working late into the night to make the parts. Exhaustion and cold made Mi Tongsheng much thinner, but whenever he thought of Chairman Mao's teachings and that his hard work was for the convenience of countless comrades, he forgot everything else. The water wheel was completed, and river water finally flowed from the pipes overhead into various large and small wooden troughs, then through the pipes to the stove, the boiling water room, the washing sink, and into the bath. The supply station's water use became automated, and everyone said that Que'er Mountain had "running water."

The severe winter of the plateau arrived, the water channel froze, and became a silver-white chain, cutting off the "running water." The cold could freeze the river water, but it could not freeze the hearts of the supply station comrades, who were armed with Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how cold the weather, they had to bring water for everyone. The entire station's comrades picked up their picks to break the ice and clear the water channel. The water was brought in, but the flow was too small to drive the water wheel, so they installed a hand-cranked pump to manually lift the water into the troughs. Fearing that the water would freeze in the wooden troughs and pipes, they installed a heater to keep it warm.

Some comrades said that the "running water" at the Ganzi Military Supply Station was a warm current formed by the supply station comrades' hearts of serving the people, a hot spring.

Yes, this is a hot spring. It washes away the snow and dust on the clothes of the passing comrades, the wind and dust on their faces, and the fatigue on their bodies, giving them the strength to cross snow-capped mountains and icy rivers. A comrade who had just arrived from the Sichuan Basin on the plateau, seeing the "running water" here, was deeply moved and said, "I never expected to find such a good supply station on the snowy plateau. It's as warm as home!"

The hot spring of the Ganzi Military Supply Station not only warms the comrades staying at the station but also flows out of the station, warming the hearts of the plateau warriors. One night, such news reached the ears of the supply station comrades: A lone truck on duty at the Karla checkpoint, 20 kilometers away from the station, had fallen into a snow pit and was stranded. Upon hearing this, the comrades at the station thought, "We cannot let our comrades freeze and starve." Thus, the station commander, Zhang Wenbo, personally led twelve comrades, carrying shovels and picks, pots, pans, and food, braved the bone-chilling cold wind to go to the rescue. Upon arrival, they cooked for some, repaired the vehicle for others. The truck driver had a hot meal, warming his body, and together with everyone, they repaired the vehicle. It was not until one in the morning that they returned to the station.

The night on the plateau is quiet. In the dormitory of the Ganzi Military Supply Station, the comrades, who had been busy all day, were enthusiastically discussing their insights from studying Chairman Mao's works. The excited voices and laughter of the comrades were like the small stream outside, flowing and gurgling. Ah! Comrades are advancing in leaps and bounds in the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. This new spirit of the supply station, which people call a hot spring, is its source not from the hands of the warriors holding the red book?

    温泉

    在海拔三千四百米的雀儿山下，有个温泉。往返川藏高原的人到这里洗个澡，洗掉旅途上的风尘疲劳，浑身感到温暖舒畅。然而，比温泉更温暖的却是座落在山下雅砻江畔的甘孜兵站。
    甘孜兵站成为风雪高原上一股暖流，这是因为兵站的同志心里有一股为人民服务的暖流。
    兵站刚建成那阵子，吃水、用水非常困难，要上下四十度的高坡到二百米以外的雅砻江去挑。自己累点，谁也没有放在心上，最使他们过意不去的是对汽车兵。汽车兵每天来到站上给汽车加水、洗车，也都要到江里去抬，在大雪飞扬的寒冬，水桶越抬越重，水却越抬越少。有些同志为了给兵站少添点麻烦，连洗脸也到江边去。累在汽车兵的身上，疼到了兵站同志们的心里。他们想，我们天天学习《为人民服务》，天天喊着完全、彻底为人民服务，让奔波了一天的汽车兵到我们兵站上来这样劳累，我们这叫啥子为人民服务？说什么也不能再这样下去了。党支部决定引水进站。于是，一场夺水的激烈战斗开始了。干部带头上阵，大家挥镐破土。虽然时值寒冬，可是雀儿山下却是热火朝天，热气腾腾。没有几天就挖了一条水渠，把两公里外雪山下的河水引进了兵站。哗哗的溪水流进了兵站，滋润着过往同志们的心，驾驶员们再也不跑“冤枉”路了，他们脸上挂着满意的笑容，乐得合不上嘴。汽车用水方便了，驾驶员满意了，可是兵站的同志又在考虑另外一个问题：兵站是千千万万个过往同志的家，不但要汽车用水方便，还要叫所有过往人员喝水、洗脸、洗澡等都方便才行呀！
    炊事班副班长吕润华一个劲儿动脑筋，想把水引到伙房里，引到开水房里，引到洗脸室里。他苦费心思地设计了一个水轮车，谁知试验几次都失败了。还没等搞下去，他就调走了。副班长没有完成的工作，又深深地压在班长米同生的心上。领导鼓励他，同志们也帮他出谋献计。他觉得，能不能把水轮车搞成，是对自己“全心全意地为人民服务”思想的一次考验。他翻开《愚公移山》，反复学习了“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，心里装上了毛主席的教导，浑身便有使不完的劲。他以愚公移山的精神，废寝忘食地搞设计，起早贪黑地制机件。劳累和寒冷使米同生消瘦了许多，但是他一想到毛主席的教导，一想到他一个人辛苦是为了千千万万个同志的方便，就什么也不顾了。水轮车制成了，河水终于从架在空中的水槽里流来了，然后又顺着各种大小不同的木槽，经过皮管，流到锅台，流到开水房，流到洗碗池里，流进了洗澡池。兵站上用水自动化了，大家都说雀儿山下有了“自来水”。
    高原上严寒的冬天来了，水渠封冻，变成了一条银白色的锁链，“自来水”断了。天寒可以冻住河水，却冻不住用毛泽东思想武装起来的兵站同志们的心，天气再冷，他们也要给大家引来水。全站同志们拿上铁镐破冰疏通水渠。水是引来了，但水小带动不了水轮车，他们又想办法安上了手摇车，用人力把水绞到槽里。怕水在木槽和皮管里冻住，又安上强化器来加热。
    有的同志说，甘孜兵站的这股“自来水”是兵站同志们为人民服务的心意汇成的一股暖流，一口温泉。
    对，这是口温泉。它冲洗着过往同志们衣服上的寒雪、脸上的风尘、身上的疲劳，给了他们翻雪山、跨冰河的力量。一位从四川盆地初上高原的同志，看到这里的“自来水”，很有感触地说：“来到风雪高原上真想不到有这样一个好的兵站，这里硬是温暖得像个家！”
    甘孜兵站这股温泉，不仅温暖着住站的同志，而且流出兵站，温暖着高原战士的心。有一天深夜里，这样一个消息传到了兵站同志的耳中：在离兵站二十公里的卡拉上，有一辆单独值勤的汽车掉进雪沟，抛了锚。听到这件事后，兵站的同志们想，决不能让战友们挨冻受饿。于是，站长张文博亲自率领十二名同志，带着锹和镐，锅碗瓢勺和主副食，冒着刺骨的寒风前去接应。赶到后，他们做饭的做饭，救车的救车，汽车驾驶员吃了一顿热腾腾的饭，身上暖和和，和大家一起救车。到深夜一点他们才回到兵站。
    高原的夜，静悄悄的，在甘孜兵站的宿舍里，忙碌了一天的兵站的同志们，正在热烈地交流学习毛主席著作的心得。大家兴奋的话语声和笑声像屋外的那条小溪在哗哗奔流。啊！同志们在活学活用毛主席著作中大步前进，这被人们称为温泉的兵站新风，它的源头不正是战士们手中的红书吗？
