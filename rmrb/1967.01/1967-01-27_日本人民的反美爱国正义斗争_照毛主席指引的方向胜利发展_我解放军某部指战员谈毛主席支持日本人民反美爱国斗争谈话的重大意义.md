On the eve of the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's talk "In Support of the Japanese People's Anti-American Patriotic Just Struggle," soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region discussed their insights from studying this important talk by our great leader Chairman Mao and expressed their full support for the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic just struggle.

They unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's talk, issued three years ago, has great historical and contemporary significance. The development of the Japanese people's struggle over the past three years and the evolution of the international situation have fully proven the correctness of Chairman Mao's talk at that time.

They said that in this talk, Chairman Mao pointed out the direction for the Japanese people's advance, greatly encouraging their anti-American patriotic struggle. They particularly happily pointed out that over the past three years, more and more Japanese people have been studying Chairman Mao's works, striving to master Mao Zedong Thought, and regarding Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding light.

Comrade Pang Xiuting, the chief of staff of a division who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, said: Chairman Mao teaches us that distinguishing between friends and enemies is the primary issue in revolution. In his talk, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out, "American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese people." Over the past three years, the broad masses of the Japanese people have seen more and more clearly the ugly face of American imperialism and its lackeys. American imperialism, in collusion with the Sato government of Japan, is hastening to turn Japan into a base for its aggression against Vietnam, invasion of China, and enslavement of Asia, and at the same time, turn Japan into a colony of the United States.

He said, the Japanese people will certainly not agree to this. As Chairman Mao correctly pointed out: "The Japanese people are a great people. They will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over them for long." Over the past three years, the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle has surged higher and higher. More and more people from various strata have joined the ranks of the struggle, and the Japanese and American reactionaries have become increasingly isolated. The Japanese people will certainly be able to drive the American imperialists out of their own country.

Comrade Chen Zhenjiang, a regiment commander who fought against the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance Against Japan, said: Today, the Soviet revisionist clique has become the number one accomplice of American imperialism. In order to pursue "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," they are sabotaging the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries around the world. In Japan, it is the same. The Soviet revisionists and their followers betray the national interests of the Japanese people, playing a counter-revolutionary role, and actually wearing the same pants as the Japanese and American reactionaries. The broad masses of the Japanese people have realized that to oppose the Japanese and American reactionaries, they must also oppose the Soviet revisionists and their followers.

Comrade Li Zhenguo, a first-class merit soldier in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, said: American imperialism is our defeated enemy, but it is not dead yet, insisting on following the old path of Japanese aggression, determined to invade our great motherland, and wanting to use the Japanese reactionaries as its lackeys. If American imperialism dares to come, let it come. We, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are fully prepared. No matter how many invaders come, we will annihilate them all.

Comrade Wang Hongguang, the political commissar of a regiment, said: American imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese people. We Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of the Japanese people as our own struggle. We will always stand on the side of the Japanese people. No one can destroy the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Japanese people.

Several soldiers and officers unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's call to form a broad united front against American imperialism is of great significance. We must unite with all anti-American forces in the world. Such a great unity will certainly smash the small unity of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and thoroughly defeat the common enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism.

　　日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争
　　照毛主席指引的方向胜利发展
　　我解放军某部指战员谈毛主席支持日本人民反美爱国斗争谈话的重大意义
    本报讯　在毛主席《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》发表三周年的前夕，北京部队某部指战员畅谈他们学习我们伟大领袖毛主席这个重要谈话的心得，并且表示全力支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。
    他们一致认为，毛主席三年前发表的这个谈话，具有伟大的历史意义和现实意义。三年来日本人民斗争的发展和国际形势的发展，完全证明了毛主席当时这个谈话的英明正确。
    他们说，毛主席在这篇谈话中指出了日本人民前进的方向，大大地鼓舞了日本人民的反美爱国斗争。他们特别高兴地指出，三年来，越来越多的日本人民学习毛主席著作，努力掌握毛泽东思想，把毛泽东思想看作是他们的指路明灯。
    曾经参加过抗日战争的师参谋长庞秀廷说：毛主席教导我们，分清敌我是革命的首要问题。毛主席在谈话中明确指出，“美帝国主义是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人。”三年来，广大日本人民对于美帝国主义及其走狗的狰狞面目看得越来越清楚了。美帝国主义勾结日本佐藤政府，加紧把日本变成为它侵略越南、进攻中国、奴役亚洲的前进基地，同时把日本变成为美国的殖民地。
    他说，日本人民当然是不会答应的。正如毛主席所正确指出的：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”三年来，日本人民的反美爱国斗争一浪高一浪。越来越广泛阶层的人民投入斗争的行列，美日反动派已经日益陷于孤立。日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义者从自己的国土上赶出去。
    在抗日战争中同日本侵略者打过仗的团长陈振江说：今天，苏联修正主义集团已成为美帝国主义的头号帮凶。他们为了追求“美苏合作主宰世界”，在全世界到处破坏各国人民的革命斗争。在日本，也是如此。苏修和它的追随者出卖日本人民的民族利益，扮演着反革命的角色，实际上同美日反动派穿上了连裆裤。日本广大人民认识到，要反对美日反动派，就必须反对苏修及其追随者。
    抗美援朝的特等功臣李贞国说：美帝国主义是我们的手下败将，但是它野心不死，硬要走日本侵略者的老路，一心要侵略我们伟大的祖国，而且想把日本反动派作为它的走卒。美帝国主义有胆量就来吧。我们中国人民解放军早就作好一切准备，侵略者来多少，就消灭它多少。
    团政委王洪广说：美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人。我们中国人民一向把日本人民的斗争看成是自己的斗争。我们永远同日本人民站在一边。任何人想要破坏中日两国人民的友谊和团结都是办不到的。
    几位指战员都一致认为，毛主席关于结成反对美帝国主义的广泛的统一战线的号召，有极其重要的意义。我们一定要同全世界一切反美力量联合起来。这样一个大联合一定能够粉碎美帝、苏修和各国反动派的小联合，彻底打败全世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义。
