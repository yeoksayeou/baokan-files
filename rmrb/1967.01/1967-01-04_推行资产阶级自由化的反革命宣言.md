Edition: 6

On March 26, 1961, the counter-revolutionary revisionist ringleader of the literary and artistic circles, Zhou Yang, and his gang published the poisonous weed "On the Issue of Themes" in the *Literary Gazette*. Coincidentally, on the same day, the proprietor of the "San Jiu Village" black shop, Deng Tuo, hoisted the black flag of "Welcome to the Eclectics." On one side, they advocated for the "necessity of further expanding themes"; on the other, they shouted that "eclectics" have "important significance" for all kinds of work. Two evil winds, one double act, jointly proposed the so-called "broadening of literary paths."

Was this a coincidence? Reviewing the situation at that time, everything becomes clear.

During the period of temporary economic difficulties in our country, international imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries jointly performed an anti-China chorus. Domestic class enemies also responded in kind, stirring up a black wind of restoring capitalism. A small clique of bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the Party could no longer contain themselves. On one side, the "San Jiu Village" gang was gleefully shouting "The winter drums sound, the spring grass grows," one by one "breaking out of the door," preparing to "do a big job." On the other side, Zhou Yang and his gang, in order to welcome their "springtime of blossoms," openly raised the banner of "broadening literary paths," frantically advocating bourgeois liberalization.

"How to 'open' the 'literary paths'?" The key lies in the themes, that is, what to write, draw, perform, and sing. The cunning Zhou Yang deeply understood: once the banner of "broad themes" is raised, the complete freedom to spread poison is obtained, then all kinds of ghosts and monsters can fully "activate," all kinds of poisonous weeds can fully "thrive," in a word, the goal of preparing public opinion for the bourgeois restoration can be achieved as desired. Under such an atmosphere, the "On the Issue of Themes" article, which adapts to the needs of all kinds of ghosts and monsters, was timely released.

The "On the Issue of Themes" article was drafted by Zhou Yang's agent in the *Literary Gazette* according to his instructions, repeatedly revised by the second-in-command of Zhou Yang's gang, Lin Mo Han, and finally edited and published by Zhou Yang himself. This poisonous weed they jointly concocted is Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary declaration of bourgeois liberalization.

"Everything, everything": Issuing a mobilization order to ghosts and monsters

In the "On the Issue of Themes" article, Zhou Yang and his gang loudly proclaimed:

"Grasp all literary weapons."

"Mobilize all positive factors."

"Utilize all possibilities."

"Let all talents and specialties be fully developed."

Four consecutive "everything," their voices are so loud, their spirit so high, unprecedented.

Chairman Mao taught us: "When we see someone holding something, we should investigate what they are holding."

At that time, it was precisely the period of temporary economic difficulties in our country. Revolutionary literature should enthusiastically reflect the revolutionary spirit and heroic spirit of our people under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, self-reliant and striving for progress, to unite them, to make them progress, to make them united, and to fight against class enemies and natural enemies!

Just at this time, what did Zhou Yang and his gang want to "grasp," "mobilize," "utilize," and "develop"? For what purpose?

A careful study of what "On the Issue of Themes" attacks, protects, opposes, and advocates reveals the problem.

Zhou Yang and his gang vehemently opposed and completely denied literature serving proletarian politics and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Do you want to quickly reflect the current revolutionary struggle and serve the revolutionary tasks set by the Party for a certain period? They would say this is "illustrating policy documents," "turning news reports into images," "staging major events," "empty and flashy style," and so on. In short: terrible.

Do you want to strive to describe major socialist themes? They would fabricate that during the steel smelting period, one could only write about steel, and during the agricultural development period, one could only write about agriculture, too "monotonous," too "narrow."

Do you want to enthusiastically sing the praises of heroes among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and sing the praises of the new people and new things that constantly emerge in life? They would say this is emphasizing to an "inappropriate degree," making "comic and satirical themes" and works describing negative and backward characters "suppressed."

Zhou Yang and his gang were extremely enthusiastic about literature serving the landlord and bourgeois classes, fully affirming everything.

Whoever followed their instructions and deviated from the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers to pursue "diversification," they would greatly praise it, calling it a "beneficial attempt," fully respecting it.

Whoever practiced their advocacy and wrote about "household affairs, love affairs," "mountains, rivers, flowers, birds, insects, and fish," "gods in the sky, animals underground," and so on, they would applaud frantically, saying that these things "can make people obtain healthy cultural rest and aesthetic enjoyment," "beneficial for satisfying the diverse spiritual needs of the people," and thus all "can enter the realm of socialist literature and art."

Against revolutionary literature, they were ruthlessly suppressing it; against reactionary literature, they were vigorously promoting it. Zhou Yang and his gang's hatred and love, opposition and advocacy, were extremely clear!

It is now clear what "literary paths" Zhou Yang and his gang want to "broaden."

There has never been an abstract "literary path." Socialist literature is fundamentally opposed to all exploitative class literature. To "open" the "literary path" of socialism, one must cleanse the muddy waters of feudal, capitalist, and revisionist literature; to "open" the "literary path" of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, one must block the "literary path" of socialism. Without destruction, there is no construction; without blocking, there is no flow; without stopping, it will not work. Their struggle is a struggle to the death.

The four "everything" shouted by Zhou Yang and his gang are a mobilization order to "all" ghosts and monsters, urging them to take up "literary weapons," mobilize "positive factors," "utilize" all "possibilities," and launch a fierce attack on the Party and socialism. Zhou Yang's call to "critically" write "history" is an order to ghosts and monsters to use historical plays and historical novels as weapons to "criticize" our reality, using ancient events to satirize the present, pointing at one thing to curse another, attacking the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat; Zhou Yang's call to "satisfy the diverse needs of the masses" and conduct "all beneficial attempts" is an order to ghosts and monsters to use the things that the landlord and bourgeois classes appreciate, to lure revolutionary people into being engrossed in "household affairs," entangled in "love affairs," infatuated with the "beauty" of "mountains, rivers, and flowers," to detach from the revolution, and to make people unknowingly undergo "peaceful evolution."

How daring and poisonous their hearts are!

"Freedom, freedom": Issuing a free pass for poisonous weeds

Zhou Yang and his gang have "rich" counter-revolutionary political experience. They fully understand: to make the theory of "broad themes" prevail and be widely promoted, to make those with "ambition" to oppose the Party have "all talents and specialties fully developed," without being "cold-shouldered or suppressed," they must first fight for political "complete freedom" from the proletariat.

Zhou Yang and his gang chattered endlessly:

"Writers and artists can freely choose and handle any theme they are good at and like."

"Choosing this theme or that theme is not only the complete freedom of the writer but also, based on the different situations of the writer, cannot be uniformly demanded."

"Writers and artists have complete freedom in choosing themes and can be unrestricted."

"Freedom," "freedom," their sense of "unfreedom" is so strong, their demand for "complete freedom" is so passionate!

Chairman Mao said: "We encourage revolutionary literary and artistic workers to actively approach workers, peasants, and soldiers, giving them complete freedom to go among the masses, and complete freedom to create truly revolutionary literature and art." Chairman Mao's literary line has opened up an endless expanse for our revolutionary literary and artistic workers' creation. Under the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and on the premise of serving proletarian politics, literary and artistic workers can give full play to their talents to the greatest extent. Why do Zhou Yang and his gang keep shouting about not being free? Why do they so eagerly fight for freedom from the Party and the people? The reason is not that the Party and the people only give literary and artistic workers "complete freedom" to "actively approach workers, peasants, and soldiers" and "go among the masses," but not the freedom to be above the masses and anti-people; only give "complete freedom" to "create truly revolutionary literature and art," but not the freedom to peddle feudal, capitalist, and revisionist poisonous weeds. This is a "suppression" of Zhou Yang and his gang's rampant anti-Party activities and a "destruction" of their creative mood for producing a large number of poisonous weeds. No wonder Zhou Yang and his gang shout so loudly about not being free and strive in every possible way to fight for freedom.

Zhou Yang and his gang said: Since we want "a hundred flowers to bloom," then writers and artists can write about anything, "unrestricted." We say, this is impossible, the people will not give such "freedom." Writers are members of a class, and literature is a tool of class struggle. What themes a writer pays attention to and chooses are controlled by their class interests. Chairman Mao said: "Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that is parallel or independent of politics, in fact, does not exist." In this regard, writers are not free. From Zhou Yang and his gang's efforts to erase the significance of major socialist themes and frantically elevate the status of themes like "household affairs" and "love affairs," it can be seen that they are fighting for the freedom for ghosts and monsters to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, to issue a "free pass" for poisonous weeds to spread. We absolutely cannot give such freedom. The more they think something is "valuable" and "meaningful," the more poisonous and harmful it is, and the more we must criticize and fight against it, absolutely not allowing it to spread freely.

Zhou Yang and his gang said, since we want "a hundred flowers to bloom," we must "broaden literary paths" and "not suppress any ambitious or talented individuals." We say, this cannot fool the people, they will not fall for it. "A hundred flowers to bloom" is an extremely firm class policy to eliminate the bourgeoisie and promote the proletariat, and its premise is the socialist path and the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers. "Broadening literary paths" that deviate from the socialist path and "diversification" that abandons the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers is bourgeois liberalization, which is absolutely not allowed! As for saying that we have "cold-shouldered or suppressed" "ambitious" and "talented" individuals, it depends on what "ambition" they have and whose "talent" they are. For all literary and artistic workers who are ambitious to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and sing the praises of the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Party and the people have always given active support and enthusiastic encouragement. On the contrary, for those who are ambitious to oppose the Party and socialism, for those who are talented in opposing communism and the people, we must absolutely "cold-shoulder or suppress" them. If they do not repent, we will also trample them down and throw them into the garbage heap of history. We have done this in the past and will firmly do so in the future.

Using the pretext of the "special" status of writers, advocating the description of "familiar themes," resisting ideological remolding

The thorough remolding of the worldview of writers, the fundamental change in class stance, and the revolutionization of the literary and artistic team are fundamental guarantees for realizing the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao repeatedly taught us: Literary and artistic workers "must move their standpoint, must, in the process of deeply entering the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and deeply entering practical struggles, in the process of learning Marxism and learning society, gradually move over, move to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, move to the side of the proletariat." The concocters of the "On the Issue of Themes" article, Zhou Yang and his gang, however, sang the opposite tune, vigorously inciting literary and artistic workers to resist ideological remolding.

We say, writers and artists are ordinary laborers, not a bit special. Zhou Yang and his gang say, no, artistic production is "a very complex and arduous labor," writers and artists have their unique "personality, style, and writing habits," and they must be "highly respected" and given "special treatment," not interfered with in the slightest. Does the Party want to lead the literary and artistic cause? Does the Party want to call on writers and artists to go to the fiery struggles of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to remold their souls? They would immediately label it with various crimes, calling it "outsiders cannot lead insiders," calling it "simple and rough interference."

We say, writers and artists must become the spokespeople of the masses, and they must go to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for long-term tempering. Only by putting down their airs and humbly becoming students of the masses can they become their spokespeople. Zhou Yang and his gang say, there is no need, writers and artists only need to, from a "leader's position," look down from above and "care" about the dynamics and psychology of various classes and figures in society; only need to, with the "heart of the protagonist," leisurely "appreciate" all beautiful things in nature, that's enough. The high and mighty "leader's position" and the leisurely "appreciator's" heart, in this way, is there still a need to combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers and undergo painful tempering and remolding?

We say, writers and artists must, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly go to the fiery struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, only in this way can they create truly proletarian literature and art. Zhou Yang and his gang say, there is no need, proletarian writers should take writers from the old era as examples, stay away from the "vortex of class struggle," write about themes they are familiar with, in this way, from the side, they can also "reflect the spirit of the times." No need to leave the study, no need to remold the soul, just drink some tea, wield the pen, relying on "outstanding" talent, and they can easily write "outstanding works" that reflect "some essence of the times," so relaxed and convenient, what is the need to learn society, learn the masses, learn class struggle, isn't that superfluous?

Zhou Yang and his gang openly opposed Chairman Mao's literary line, creating various pretexts and fabricating various lies, resisting ideological remolding, aiming to lead literary and artistic workers onto a revisionist path of creation that detaches from the masses, detaches from reality, and detaches from the revolution, to rally the team and prepare organizationally for their restoration of capitalism; to spread poisonous weeds and prepare public opinion for their restoration of capitalism.

After beating the opening drums and throwing out the "On the Issue of Themes" article, Zhou Yang and his gang, in order to create momentum, expand public opinion, and deepen influence, actively ran around and engaged in activities. They directed the *Literary Gazette* to collect reflections, organize "celebrities from various circles" to hold discussions, instruct newspapers and magazines to open special columns for discussion. Zhou Yang's counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line agents in various places also busily rushed to action, holding meetings, giving reports, writing articles, busy beyond words. After this meticulous effort, indeed, the "celebrities" were extremely "excited," the "literary paths" were once "broadened." Some people were overjoyed, saying that the problem was raised timely and well, speaking the words in their hearts; some people were eager, saying that "the leadership has the freedom to call, and writers also have the freedom to choose"; some people were "dreamy," firmly predicting that the publication of the "On the Issue of Themes" article "will surely promote the development and prosperity of literature and art." In short, ghosts and monsters all expressed their gratitude to Zhou Yang for giving them complete freedom, expressing their determination not to disappoint their "mission" and to "do a big job."

The "On the Issue of Themes" article paved the way for bourgeois liberalization. Various strange theories and all kinds of bad works and big poisonous weeds all came out at this time. These various poisonous weeds, with "broad" themes and "diverse" varieties, in full bloom, formed a counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist reverse current, making everything chaotic, playing a corrupting and bewitching role among the masses. "If there are errors, they must be criticized; if there are poisonous weeds, they must be fought against." Zhou Yang and his gang's counter-revolutionary and anti-socialist big poisonous weed, the "On the Issue of Themes" article, has widespread poison and deep influence. We must thoroughly expose it, eliminate it, uproot it, and cleanse its influence.

    推行资产阶级自由化的反革命宣言
    艾延
    一九六一年三月二十六日，文艺界反革命修正主义头目周扬及其一伙，在《文艺报》上抛出了《题材问题》专论这棵大毒草。无独有偶，也就在这一天，“三家村”黑店的掌柜邓拓，打出了《欢迎“杂家”》这面大黑旗。这边鼓吹，题材有“继续扩大之必要”；那边叫嚷，“杂家”对各项工作有着“重要意义”。两股妖风，一出双簧，共同提出了所谓“广开文路”的问题。
    这是偶然的巧合吗？回顾一下当时的形势，就一清二楚了。
    在我国经济暂时困难时期，国际上帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派联合演出了反华大合唱，国内的阶级敌人也紧相呼应，刮起了复辟资本主义的黑风。一小撮混进党内的资产阶级代表人物憋不住了。这边，“三家村”一帮得意洋洋地叫喊“腊鼓鸣，春草生”，一个个“破门而出”，准备“大干”一番。那边，周扬一伙为了迎接他们“春暖花开的时期”，公然竖起了“广开文路”的旗号，拚命鼓吹资产阶级自由化。
    “文路”怎么“开”？关键在于题材，即写什么，画什么，演什么，唱什么的问题。老谋深算的周扬深深懂得：打出了“题材广泛”的旗号，争取到了大肆放毒的“完全自由”，那么，各种牛鬼蛇神就可以充分“活跃”了，各种毒草就可以充分“兴旺”了，一句话，为资产阶级复辟准备舆论的目的也可以如愿以偿。在这种气候下，《题材问题》专论适应各种牛鬼蛇神的需要，及时出笼了。
    《题材问题》专论，是由周扬在《文艺报》的代理人遵照他的旨意执笔起草，由周扬一伙的二号头目林默涵反复加工修改，最后经周扬亲手批改定稿抛出的。他们合伙炮制的这棵大毒草，是周扬推行资产阶级自由化的反革命宣言。
    “一切”“一切”：向牛鬼蛇神发出动员令
    周扬一伙在《题材问题》专论里，大声疾呼：
    “把一切文艺武器掌握起来”。
    “把一切积极因素调动起来”。
    “把一切可能性利用起来”。
    “使一切才能、一切专长都能得到发挥”。
    连珠炮式的四个“一切”，其嗓门之高，劲头之足，是空前的。
    毛主席教导我们：“看到人家手里拿着东西了，我们就要调查一下。他手里拿的是什么？”
    当时，正是我国经济遭到暂时困难时期。革命的文艺，应当满腔热情地去反映我国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神和英雄气概，使他们团结，使他们进步，使他们同心同德，和阶级敌人，和自然界的敌人战斗！
    就在这个时候，周扬一伙所谓的要“掌握起来”“调动起来”“利用起来”“发挥”起来的是些什么东西呢？干什么用的呢？
    认真研究一下《题材问题》专论打击的是什么，保护的是什么，反对的是什么，鼓吹的是什么，问题就明白了。
    周扬一伙对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务，拚命反对，一概否定。
    你要迅速反映当前的革命斗争，为党在一定时期所规定的革命任务服务吗？他们就说这是“图解政策条文”啦，是把“新闻报道形象化”啦，是把“重大事件舞台化”啦，是“华而不实的作风”啦，等等。一言以蔽之：糟透了。
    你要努力描写社会主义重大题材吗？他们就捏造说，大炼钢铁的时候“只能”写钢铁，大办农业的时候“只能”写农业，太“单调”了，太“狭隘”了。
    你要热情歌颂工农兵群众中的英雄人物、歌颂生活中不断涌现的新人新事吗？他们就说这是强调到了“不适当的程度”，使什么“喜剧性、讽刺性的题材，描写反面人物、落后人物的作品”受到“压抑”了。
    周扬一伙对文艺为地主资产阶级服务，万分热心，统统肯定。
    谁要是禀承他们旨意，背离工农兵方向去搞什么“多样化”，他们就大加吹捧，一概称之为“有益的尝试”，一律受到他们“充分的尊重”。
    谁要是实践他们的主张，去写什么“家务事、儿女情”，什么“山水花卉、鸟兽虫鱼”，什么“天上的神仙、地下的动物”等等，他们就拚命鼓掌，说这类东西“能够使人们得到健康的文化休息和美的享受”，“有利于满足人民群众精神生活上的多方面的需要”，因而统统“可以进入社会主义的文学艺术的领域”。
    对革命的文艺是百般扼杀，对反动的文艺是竭力提倡，周扬一伙恨什么、爱什么，反对什么、鼓吹什么，是何等的鲜明！
    周扬一伙要“广开”什么“文路”，至此清楚了。
    从来没有什么抽象的“文路”。社会主义文艺与一切剥削阶级的文艺是根本对立的。要“开”社会主义的“文路”，就要荡涤封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺的污泥浊水；要“开”封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的“文路”，就要堵塞社会主义的“文路”。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死的斗争。
    周扬一伙叫嚷的四个“一切”，是向“一切”牛鬼蛇神发出的动员令，要他们拿起“文艺武器”，调动“积极因素”，“利用”一切“可能性”，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻。周扬叫嚷“以批判的态度”大写“历史”，就是号召牛鬼蛇神用历史剧、历史小说为武器来“批判”我们的现实，借古讽今，指桑骂槐，攻击党中央和毛主席，攻击无产阶级专政；周扬叫嚷“为满足群众多样化的需要”而去进行“一切有益的尝试”，就是号召牛鬼蛇神用地主资产阶级所欣赏的那一套东西，引诱革命人民沉溺于“家务事”，缠绵于“儿女情”，迷恋于“山水花卉”之“美”，脱离革命，使人在不知不觉之中被“和平演变”过去。
    周扬一伙胆何其大，心何其毒也！
    “自由”“自由”：给毒草出笼大发通行证
    周扬一伙有着“丰富”的反革命的政治经验。他们十分懂得：要使“题材广泛”论畅行无阻、广为兜售，要使有“志”于反党之“士”的“一切才能、一切专长都能得到发挥”，不受“冷淡或压抑”，首先要向无产阶级争得政治上的“充分自由”。
    周扬一伙喋喋不休地叫嚷：
    “作家艺术家完全可以按照自己的不同情况，自由地选择与处理他所擅长、他所喜爱的任何题材”。
    “采取这种题材或那种题材，这不但是作家的充分自由，也根据作家的不同情况，不能强求一律”。
    “作家艺术家在选择题材上，完全有充分的自由，可以不受任何限制”。
    “自由”，“自由”，他们的“不自由”之感好强烈，要求“充分自由”的呼声好激昂呵！
    毛主席说：“我们鼓励革命文艺家积极地亲近工农兵，给他们以到群众中去的完全自由，给他们以创作真正革命文艺的完全自由。”毛主席制定的文艺路线，为我们革命文艺工作者的创作开辟了无限广阔的天地。在为工农兵服务的方向下，在为无产阶级政治服务的前提下，文艺工作者可以最大限度地施展自己的才能。为什么周扬一伙却口口声声叫嚷不自由呢？要那样起劲地向党向人民争自由呢？原因不是别的，就在于党和人民只给文艺工作者“积极地亲近工农兵”，“到群众中去”的“完全自由”，不给高踞在群众之上反人民的自由；只给“创作真正革命文艺”的“完全自由”，不给贩卖封建主义、资本主义、修正主义毒草的自由。这对周扬一伙猖狂的反党活动，是个“压抑”，对他们大量炮制毒草的“创作情绪”，是个“破坏”，难怪周扬一伙要声嘶力竭地叫嚷不自由，千方百计地起来争自由了。
    周扬一伙说：既然要“百花齐放”，那么作家艺术家写什么都可以，“可以不受任何限制”。我们说，这办不到，人民群众不会给这样的“自由”。作家是阶级的一分子，文艺是阶级斗争的工具。一个作家注意什么题材，选择什么题材，是受他的阶级利益的支配的。毛主席说：“为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”在这一点上，作家并不自由。从周扬一伙竭力抹煞社会主义重大题材的意义，拚命抬高“家务事、儿女情”等题材的身价来看，他们争的是给牛鬼蛇神干反革命勾当的自由，是要给毒草出笼大发“通行证”。对于这样的自由，我们断断不能给。他们越认为“有价值、有意义”的东西，就越有毒、越有害，我们就越要批判，越要斗争，决不能让它们自由泛滥。
    周扬一伙说，既然要“百花齐放”，就要“广开文路”，就要“不使任何有志之士、有用之才受到压抑”。我们说，这骗不了人民群众，他们不会上这个当。“百花齐放”是灭资兴无的极端坚定的阶级政策，它的前提是社会主义道路和工农兵方向。离开社会主义道路的“广开文路”，背弃工农兵方向的“多样化”，就是资产阶级的自由化，这是断断不能允许的！至于说我们“冷淡或压抑”了“有志之士”和“有用之才”，那就要看“有”的是什么“志”，为谁所“用”的“才”了。对于一切有志于宣传毛泽东思想，歌颂工农兵英雄人物的文艺工作者，党和人民从来是给予积极的支持和热情的鼓励的。相反，对于那些“有志”于反党反社会主义“之士”，对于那些反共反人民的“有用之才”，我们要绝对地“冷淡或压抑”，如果他们死不悔改，我们还要踏倒他们，把他们扔进历史的垃圾堆。我们过去这样做了，今后还要坚定地这样做。
    借口作家地位“特殊”，鼓吹描写“熟悉题材”，抗拒思想改造
    作家世界观的彻底改造，阶级立场的根本转变，文艺队伍的革命化，是实现文艺工农兵方向的一个根本保证。毛主席谆谆教导我们：文艺工作者“一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。”《题材问题》专论的炮制者周扬一伙却大唱反调，竭力煽动文艺工作者抗拒思想改造。
    我们说，作家艺术家也是普通劳动者，容不得半点特殊。周扬一伙说，不然，艺术生产是“一件很复杂、很艰苦的劳动”，作家艺术家有他独特的“个性、风格和写作习惯”，只能对他“无限尊重”，给予“特殊照顾”，丝毫不能过问。党要领导文艺事业吗？党要号召作家艺术家到工农兵群众火热的斗争生活中去改造灵魂吗？他们就给扣上种种罪名，这叫做“外行不能领导内行”，这叫做“简单粗暴的干涉”。
    我们说，作家艺术家要做人民群众的代言人，就要到工农兵群众中去进行长期的磨炼。只有放下架子，老老实实地当群众的学生，才能当群众的代言人。周扬一伙说，大可不必，作家艺术家只要以“领导者的地位”，居高临下，“关心”一下“社会上各个阶级、各种人物的动态与心理”就够了；只要“以主人公的心情”，悠哉悠哉，“欣赏”一下“自然界一切美好的事物”就行了。高高在上的“领导者的地位”，悠然闲适的“欣赏”者的“心情”，如此这般，还用得着和工农兵结合，进行痛苦的磨炼和改造么？
    我们说，作家艺术家必须按照毛主席的教导，长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵火热的斗争中去，只有这样，才能创造出真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。周扬一伙说，完全不需要，无产阶级的作家应当以旧时代的作家为榜样，离开“阶级斗争漩涡的中心”，写自己“熟悉的题材”，这样，从侧面同样能“反映时代精神”。书斋不用走出，灵魂不用改造，喝喝清茶，耍耍笔杆，凭着“杰出”的才能，就能写出反映“时代的某些本质”的“杰出作品”来，如此轻松便当，什么学习社会，学习群众，学习阶级斗争，岂不是多此一举了吗？
    周扬一伙如此公开地同毛主席的文艺路线唱对台戏，制造种种借口，胡诌种种谎言，抗拒思想改造，目的是想把文艺工作者引到一条脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离革命的修正主义的创作道路上去，以拉拢队伍，为他们复辟资本主义作组织上的准备；以大放毒草，为他们复辟资本主义作舆论上的准备。
    打起了开场锣鼓，抛出了《题材问题》专论以后，周扬一伙为了制造声势，扩大舆论，加深影响，又四处奔走，积极活动。他们指挥《文艺报》搜集反映，组织“各界名流”举行座谈，指示报刊开辟专栏讨论。周扬反革命修正主义文艺黑线在各地的代理人，也争先恐后地忙碌起来，开会的开会，作报告的作报告，写文章的写文章，忙得不可开交。经过这一番苦心经营，果然“名流”极为“振奋”，“文路”一度“广开”。有的人兴高采烈，说什么问题提得及时，提得好，说出了他们的心里话；有的人磨拳擦掌，说什么“领导有号召的自由，作家也有选择的自由”；有的人“悠然神往”，断然预言《题材问题》专论的发表，“必然促使文学艺术的发展和繁荣”。总之，牛鬼蛇神纷纷向给予他们充分自由的周扬表示感恩戴德，表示不辱“使命”，准备“大干”一场的决心。
    《题材问题》专论为资产阶级自由化开了道。五花八门的奇谈怪论，各种各样的坏作品、大毒草，都在这个时候出笼了。这些形形色色的毒草，题材“广泛”，品种“多样”，花色齐全，组成了一股反党反社会主义的逆流，闹得乌烟瘴气，起了腐蚀群众、蛊惑人心的坏作用。“有错误就得批判，有毒草就得进行斗争。”周扬一伙炮制的《题材问题》专论这棵反党反社会主义大毒草，流毒很广，影响很深，我们一定要彻底搞臭它，铲除它，挖掉它的根子，肃清它的影响。
