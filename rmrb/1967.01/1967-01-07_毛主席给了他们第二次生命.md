During a high-altitude flight, a soldier lost consciousness due to lack of oxygen. Another soldier went to give him oxygen, but cut off his own supply and fainted. A third soldier went to rescue him and also fainted. A fourth...

Those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are engaged in the most courageous and selfless battle. In the end, they all escaped safely.

Chairman Mao gave them a second life.

On November 23, 1966, mechanic Zhou Kebin of the People's Liberation Army Air Force and his comrades sang "Strive for Victory," a song of Chairman Mao's quotations, with full confidence as they boarded the plane to carry out a high-altitude flight mission.

The plane flew through the blue sky. Communist Party member and model soldier Zhou Kebin, as always, cared for every comrade and meticulously checked the oxygen masks of every crew member on the plane. When he found that some comrades' oxygen masks were not fastened tightly, he quickly found some straps to secure them tightly. Only after checking everything did he sit down and relax.

After flying at high altitude for a while, Zhou Kebin, who was sitting in the middle of the cabin, noticed that the mechanic Zhang Shoushan in the rear cabin had his head down. He threw two apples at him. The first hit his right chest, but he didn't move. The second hit his face, but he still didn't move. It turned out that Zhang Shoushan was on his first high-altitude mission and lacked experience with oxygen use. He inadvertently loosened his mask, and the oxygen leaked out, causing him to lose consciousness. Zhou Kebin quickly ran to the cabin door five meters away to get an oxygen bottle, but his oxygen tube was only one meter long and couldn't reach. What to do? In an instant, the image of Norman Bethune, who was selfless and dedicated to others, appeared before him. "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai," Chairman Mao's words were a command, and they must be carried out! Isn't this what Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang did? He quickly removed his own oxygen tube and rushed to rescue Zhang Shoushan. At this time, Zhang Shoushan's face was purple and he was unconscious. Zhou Kebin pressed Zhang Shoushan's oxygen mask several times and shook his head. However, it was still ineffective. Zhou Kebin then flipped over to the front cabin to get the emergency oxygen bottle. Just as he picked up the oxygen bottle, due to the long time without oxygen, he collapsed on the cabin floor before reaching Zhang Shoushan.

At this time, mechanic and Communist Party member Wu Gen Suo, who was working in the front cabin, saw Zhou Kebin fall down and rushed over with an emergency oxygen bottle, pumping oxygen into Zhou Kebin's mask several times, but it didn't work. It turned out that Zhou Kebin was wearing a mask without a tube. Time is life! Wu Gen Suo suddenly saw the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the cabin and the golden quotation "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He felt a surge of strength. What's the rush? Chairman Mao is by our side! What's to fear? Chairman Mao is commanding our battle! As long as we can save our comrades' lives, even if we sacrifice ourselves, it is the greatest honor. He quickly took off his own oxygen mask and put it on Zhou Kebin's face, but before he could secure it, he also fainted due to lack of oxygen.

Chairman Mao said: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue to fight." Mechanic and party branch secretary Zhang Peng, who was working in the front cabin, saw that three comrades had all fainted due to lack of oxygen. He quickly removed his own oxygen tube and rushed to the rear cabin, picking up the emergency oxygen bottle that Wu Gen Suo had dropped and reviving him. Then, Zhang Peng took a spare oxygen tube and deeply inhaled a few breaths, quickly going to the front cabin to report to the pilot. After Wu Gen Suo woke up, he immediately put the emergency oxygen bottle on Zhou Kebin's mouth, reviving him. Then, Zhou Kebin and Wu Gen Suo worked together to rescue Zhang Shoushan.

At this time, the plane rapidly descended, and all personnel escaped safely. The thrilling battle was over, and the plane continued to ascend and carry out the mission.

This battle lasted only a few minutes. In these few minutes, it fully demonstrated that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, most selfless, and have the greatest fighting spirit. Zhang Shoushan said well: "Oxygen is indeed important, but more important is Mao Zedong Thought. If it weren't for the comrades armed with Mao Zedong Thought rushing forward one after another and risking their lives to save me, even if there were oxygen, it wouldn't reach my mouth. I thank my comrades, but I am even more grateful to our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao. It is he who gave us a second life."

The party committee of a certain unit in the Air Force commended the advanced deeds of Zhou Kebin and others and launched a campaign to learn from them in the unit. Xinhua News Agency correspondent

### 毛主席给了他们第二次生命

    在一次高空飞行中，一个战士由于失氧，失去了知觉。另一个战士去为他输氧，自己断了氧气，晕倒了。第三个战士去抢救，也晕倒了。第四个……。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，在进行着一场最勇敢最无私的战斗。最后他们全部脱险了
    毛主席给了他们第二次生命
    一九六六年十一月二十三日，人民解放军空军某部机械员周克斌和他的战友们高唱着《争取胜利》的毛主席语录歌，满怀信心地登上飞机准备执行高空航行任务。
    飞机在蔚蓝色的天空飞行。共产党员、五好战士周克斌像过去一样，关心每一个同志，认真细致地检查飞机上每一个乘员的氧气面罩。当他发现有的同志氧气面罩戴得不紧，就赶紧找来带子，替他牢牢地拴紧，直到一切都检查好后，他才放心地坐下。
    在高空飞行了一段时间后，坐在机舱中段的周克斌发现坐在后舱的机械师张守善低着脑袋，就拿起两个苹果投去，第一次打在他的右胸窝，没动，第二次打在他的脸上，还没动。原来张守善是第一次执行高空任务，缺乏用氧的经验，无意中松动了面罩，氧气跑掉了，失去了知觉。周克斌赶忙朝五米以外的机舱门跑去抱氧气瓶，可是自己的面罩导管只有一米长，够不着。怎么办？霎时间，白求恩毫不利己专门利人的高大形象出现在他的眼前。“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”，毛主席的话就是命令，我们要坚决执行！雷锋、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥不正是这样做的吗！他迅速地摘掉自己的氧气导管，奋不顾身地跑去抢救张守善同志。这时张守善脸已发紫，晕迷不醒，周克斌便把张守善的氧气面罩用力压了几下，晃动着他的头。但是，仍然无效，周克斌便翻身到前舱搬急救氧气瓶。刚搬起氧气瓶，因断氧时间较长，还没到张守善跟前，周克斌就晕倒在机舱地板上。
    这时，在前舱工作的机械师、共产党员武根锁同志，看到周克斌倒下了，便抱了一个急救氧气瓶跑去，往周克斌的面罩灌输氧气，冲了几下不起作用，原来周克斌戴的是没有导管的面罩。时间就是生命！武根锁同志猛抬头看到挂在机舱里的毛主席像和“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这条金光闪闪的语录时，他浑身增添了无穷的力量。慌什么？毛主席就在我们身旁！怕什么？毛主席就在指挥我们战斗！只要能救出战友的生命，自己即使是牺牲了也是最大的光荣。他顺手把自己的氧气面罩取下，套在周克斌的嘴上，但没等戴好，他也因断氧晕倒了。
    毛主席说：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”正在前舱工作的机械员、党小组长张鹏，看到三个同志都因缺氧倒下了，就摘掉了自己的氧气导管赶紧往后舱冲，跑到后舱拣起武根锁拿的急救氧气瓶把他救醒了。随后，张鹏又抓了一根备用氧气导管深深地吸了两口，连忙到前舱向机长报告。武根锁醒了以后，又把急救氧气瓶堵在周克斌的嘴上，使他也醒过来了。接着周克斌、武根锁又奋力抢救张守善同志。
    这时，飞机急速下降，人员全部脱险。一场惊心动魄的战斗过去，飞机又继续升高，执行任务。
    这场战斗，前后只有几分钟。在这几分钟里，充分体现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人最勇敢，最无私，战斗力最大。张守善同志说得好：“氧气固然重要，但更重要的是毛泽东思想，要不是有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的同志们前赴后继，舍身抢救我，即使有了氧气也送不到我的嘴边。我感谢同志们，但更感谢我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，是他给了我们第二次生命。”
