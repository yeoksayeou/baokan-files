At a conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, Deputy Squad Leader Qing Xianbao took the stage to share his experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's quotations. He did not have a script, but he spoke vividly and appropriately quoted Chairman Mao's quotations, reciting them fluently. Someone in the audience checked the quotations he mentioned and found not a single mistake. Those who had heard his report were deeply moved and unanimously praised him as a "living quotation book."

Qing Xianbao is the son of a poor peasant. In this great school of Mao Zedong Thought that is the People's Liberation Army, his class consciousness has been continuously raised, and his enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's quotations has grown stronger and stronger. He learns one, remembers one, and applies one.

Once, Qing Xianbao took a train to a sister unit. He wanted to recite some of Chairman Mao's quotations to the passengers and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. However, he was afraid that his Sichuan accent might not be understood and that he would be laughed at; moreover, reciting quotations in front of so many people, with hundreds of eyes staring at him, made him feel embarrassed. The train was running, and his mind was in a fierce struggle.

Should he propagate or not? He recalled a passage from Chairman Mao: "When encountering the masses, not propagating, not agitating, not speaking, not investigating, not inquiring, not caring about their joys and sorrows, indifferent, forgetting that one is a Communist, confusing a Communist with an ordinary person." He immediately gave himself an order: Every word of Chairman Mao must be executed resolutely, without any hesitation. "Fear of ridicule," "embarrassment," is the small-bourgeois ideology playing tricks in his mind. The question is whether he dares to struggle against the small-bourgeois ideology in his mind. Thus, he stood up resolutely and recited Chairman Mao's quotations to the passengers. Seeing that many people on the train had no seats, he recited this quotation: "All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other." Many passengers, after hearing this, immediately practiced mutual assistance and love, giving up their seats to let those standing sit down.

In this way, throughout the journey, he saw a problem and propagated the relevant quotations, earnestly propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the masses. The passengers listened and praised, saying: "The comrade from the People's Liberation Army has truly imprinted Chairman Mao's quotations in his mind and applied Chairman Mao's words actively."

专栏：大学毛主席著作  大立毛泽东思想

    印在脑子里  用在行动上
    在解放军某部学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会上，副班长卿显保登台讲活学活用毛主席语录的心得。他没有讲稿，却讲得有声有色，而且在引用毛主席语录时，条条引用恰当，句句背诵如流。有人在台下按他讲的语录进行了查对，没有一句念错。听他作过报告的人，都很感动，齐声夸奖他是“活语录本”。
    卿显保是贫农的儿子。在解放军这个毛泽东思想大学校里，他的阶级觉悟不断提高，学习毛主席语录的劲头也越来越大。他学一条，记一条，用一条。
    一次，卿显保搭火车去兄弟部队。他想给旅客背几段毛主席语录，宣传毛泽东思想。但是，又怕自己的四川口音人家听不懂，叫人笑话；再说，在这么多人面前背语录，几百双眼睛瞅着自己，怪不好意思。火车在奔跑，他脑子里也在激烈斗争。
    宣传不宣传呢？他想起毛主席的一段话：“见群众不宣传，不鼓动，不演说，不调查，不询问，不关心其痛痒，漠然置之，忘记了自己是一个共产党员，把一个共产党员混同于一个普通的老百姓。”他立刻给自己下命令：毛主席的话每一句都应该坚决执行，一句也含糊不得。“怕笑话”，“不好意思”，是小资产阶级思想在自己的头脑里作怪。敢不敢宣传，是敢不敢同自己头脑中的小资产阶级思想进行斗争的问题。于是，他毅然地站起来，给旅客宣讲毛主席语录。他见乘车的人多，有人没有座位，就背诵起这样一段语录：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”许多旅客听了后，立刻发扬互助友爱的精神，匀出座位，让站着的旅客坐。
    就这样，一路上，他见啥问题就宣讲有关的语录，认真地向群众宣传毛泽东思想。旅客们听了称赞说：“解放军同志，真是把毛主席语录刻进脑子里去了，把毛主席的话用活了。”
