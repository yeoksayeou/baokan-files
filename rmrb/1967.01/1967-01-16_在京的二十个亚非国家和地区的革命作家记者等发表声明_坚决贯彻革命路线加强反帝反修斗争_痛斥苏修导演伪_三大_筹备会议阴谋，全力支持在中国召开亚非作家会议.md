Chairman Mao said: "All Marxist-Leninists of the world, unite! All revolutionary peoples of the world, unite! Down with imperialism! Down with modern revisionism! Down with all reactionaries!"

Twenty revolutionary writers, journalists, and other freedom fighters from Asian and African countries and regions in Beijing issued a statement on January 14. They strongly condemned the preparatory meeting for the fake Third Afro-Asian Writers Conference organized by the Soviet revisionist leadership in Cairo. They resolutely support the revolutionary line of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau and respond to the statement issued by the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau on December 17, 1966, in Beijing, which strongly condemned the fake "Third Conference" preparatory meeting organized by the Soviet modern revisionist leadership.

The statement issued by the revolutionary writers, journalists, and other freedom fighters from twenty countries and regions in Beijing on January 14 said: We, revolutionary writers, journalists, and other Asian and African freedom fighters, spit on the call by Soviet revisionists for "all Asian, African, and world writers" to "eliminate differences" with imperialism. We condemn their organizational steps to split the Asian and African writers' movement. We solemnly pledge to adhere to the anti-imperialist revolutionary line formed by the Asian and African writers' movement over the past eight years. We reaffirm: Asian and African writers must actively engage in the fiery struggles of the Asian and African peoples, promote the common struggle of the Asian and African peoples for genuine national independence, and thus "create and develop anti-imperialist, revolutionary, popular, and national new culture and literature." We resolutely reject the poisonous weeds spread by Soviet revisionist writers that "art and literature are not politics."

The statement strongly condemns the conspiracy of Soviet revisionists to sabotage and split the Asian and African writers' movement and other organizations of Asian and African peoples' unity. The statement said: At present, when Soviet revisionists are engaged in pseudo-anti-imperialism and true surrender, pseudo-support and true betrayal, pseudo-unity and true split, we are increasingly aware of the urgent necessity to expose, reject, and eliminate the influence of Soviet modern revisionism and its followers while engaged in the life-and-death struggle against imperialism. We believe that, like all imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists will also be defeated, fail, and ultimately perish.

The statement exposes how Soviet modern revisionists use so-called international organizations to betray the struggles of revolutionary peoples around the world, especially the anti-American struggle of the Vietnamese people. The statement said: We believe that to solve the Vietnamese problem, U.S. imperialism must completely withdraw from Vietnam. There is no other way.

The statement lists numerous facts exposing how Soviet modern revisionists are doing their utmost to sabotage the national liberation movements of Asian and African peoples, pursuing their policy of surrender and cooperation with the United States to dominate the world. The statement points out that Soviet modern revisionists are the number one accomplice of the imperialists led by the United States and all reactionaries.

The statement exposes that Soviet revisionists have created numerous rumors to diminish the significance of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards movement, and to erase its importance to the Chinese and world revolution. The statement said: The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being carried out in China has sounded the loudest death knell for imperialism and modern revisionism. The world's revolutionary peoples regard Mao Zedong Thought as their guide and action directive, which has already produced tremendous power and shown a brilliant prospect. This has caused Soviet modern revisionists to panic. However, all these dirty anti-China tricks of Soviet revisionists, as the Chinese saying goes, are "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet."

The statement said: Under the leadership of the Colombo Permanent Bureau and the Beijing Executive Secretariat, the success of the revolutionary line of the Asian and African writers' movement has greatly inspired us. We welcome the joint statement currently signed by the Asian and African Writers Delegation with revolutionary writers' organizations in Pakistan, Syria, Guinea, Tanzania, Somalia, Ghana, and other countries. These statements clearly show: The revolutionary line of the Asian and African Writers' Permanent Bureau has been approved, the counter-revolutionary line of the "Asian and African Writers Association" sponsored by Soviet revisionists has been rejected, and the fake "Third Conference" to be held in Lebanon has been refused. The statement calls on all Asian and African freedom fighters and peoples to actively join the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries, as well as against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership. Contribute to the further victory of the revolutionary line of the Asian and African writers' movement, and concentrate all efforts to ensure the glorious success of the Third Afro-Asian Writers Conference to be held in China this year.

The statement was signed by writers, journalists, and freedom fighters from Angola, Azania (South Africa), Basutoland, Bechuanaland, Cameroon, Ceylon, China, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Malaya, Mozambique, Niger, North Kalimantan, Southwest Africa, Sudan, Thailand, Yemen, and Zimbabwe who are currently in Beijing. Among them are Chardjo of Indonesia, Euma Shuu and his wife Toyoda Masako of Japan, Marubin and Mushi of Bechuanaland, Kair of Sudan, Salma of Malaya, and Jin Jingmai of China.

    毛主席说：“全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。”
    在京的二十个亚非国家和地区的革命作家记者等发表声明
    坚决贯彻革命路线加强反帝反修斗争
    痛斥苏修导演伪“三大”筹备会议阴谋，全力支持在中国召开亚非作家会议
    新华社十五日讯　二十个亚非国家和地区的革命作家、记者和其他自由战士十四日在北京集会，一致通过了一项声明，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团导演的开罗伪第三次亚非作家会议的筹备会议，坚决支持亚非作家常设局的革命路线，响应亚非作家常设局一九六六年十二月十七日在北京发表的强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义领导集团导演的开罗伪“三大”筹备会议的声明。
    在京的二十个国家和地区的革命作家、记者和其他自由战士十四日发表的声明说，我们，革命作家、记者和其他亚非自由战士，唾弃苏联修正主义者要“所有亚非及世界作家”与帝国主义“消除分歧”的号召，谴责他们在组织上采取的分裂亚非作家运动的步骤。我们庄严地保证坚持亚非作家运动产生八年以来所形成的反帝革命路线。我们重申：亚非作家只有积极地投身到亚非人民的火热斗争中去，促进亚非人民争取与维护真正民族独立的共同斗争，才能够“创造和发展亚非反帝革命的、人民大众的、民族的新文化、新文艺”。我们断然拒绝苏联修正主义作家所散布的“艺术和文学不是政治”的毒草。
    声明最强烈地谴责苏联修正主义者破坏和分裂亚非作家运动和其他亚非人民团结组织的阴谋。声明说，目前，当苏联修正主义者从事假反帝、真投降，假支持、真背叛，假团结、真分裂的时候，我们越来越意识到，在进行生死的反帝革命斗争的同时，揭露、摈弃、消除苏联现代修正主义及其追随者影响的迫切必要性。我们相信，苏联现代修正主义者像所有帝国主义者一样，也将会是捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡。
    声明揭露苏联现代修正主义者利用一些所谓的国际组织出卖世界各国革命人民的斗争，特别是出卖越南人民的反美斗争。声明说，我们认为，要解决越南问题，美帝国主义必须完全从越南滚出去。除此之外没有别的办法。
    声明列举大量事实揭露了苏联现代修正主义者在竭尽全力破坏亚非人民的民族解放运动，推行他们的美苏合作主宰世界的投降主义政策。声明指出，苏联现代修正主义者是以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派的头号帮凶。
    声明揭露苏联修正主义者制造了大量流言蜚语，企图抵消中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动的意义，抹杀其对中国及世界革命的重要性。声明说，中国正在胜利进行的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命已为帝国主义和现代修正主义敲起了最响亮的丧钟。世界革命人民把毛泽东思想当作他们的指南和行动的指导，已经产生了巨大威力和展现出了灿烂前景。这使苏联现代修正主义者感到惊慌。但是，苏联修正主义者所有这些反华的肮脏把戏，正如同中国俗语所说的，他们是“搬起石头砸自己的脚”。
    声明说，在科伦坡常设局和北京执行书记处的领导下，亚非作家运动的革命路线的正确与成功，使我们受到极大的鼓舞。我们欢呼亚非作家代表团目前与巴基斯坦、叙利亚、几内亚、坦桑尼亚、索马里、加纳等其它革命作家组织签署的联合声明。这些声明清楚地表明：亚非作家常设局的革命路线得到了赞许，苏联修正主义所主办的“亚非作家协会”的反革命路线遭到摈弃，而在黎巴嫩要召开的伪“三大”被拒绝。声明号召所有亚非自由战士和人民，积极投入反对以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派以及反对以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，为亚非作家运动革命路线的进一步胜利做出贡献，集中全力争取今年在中国召开的第三届亚非作家会议取得光辉胜利。
    在这项声明上签名的有在北京的安哥拉、阿扎尼亚（南非）、巴苏陀兰、贝专纳、喀麦隆、锡兰、中国、印度尼西亚、伊朗、日本、约旦、马来亚、莫三鼻给、尼日尔、北加里曼丹、西南非、苏丹、泰国、也门、津巴布韦的作家、记者和自由战士。他们当中有印度尼西亚的查禾多，日本的江马修和夫人丰田正子，贝专纳的马鲁宾、穆西，苏丹的凯尔，马来亚的萨尔玛，中国的金敬迈等。
