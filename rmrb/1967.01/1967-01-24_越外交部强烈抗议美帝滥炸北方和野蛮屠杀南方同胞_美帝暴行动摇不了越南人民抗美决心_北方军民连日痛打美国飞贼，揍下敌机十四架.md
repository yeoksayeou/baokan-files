The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry strongly protests the U.S. bombing of the North and the brutal massacre of southern compatriots. U.S. atrocities cannot shake the Vietnamese people's resolve to resist America.

North Vietnamese military and civilians have been fiercely fighting back against American air pirates over the past few days, shooting down 14 enemy planes.

	Hanoi, January 22 (New China News Agency) - The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 22 strongly condemning the savage bombing by U.S. aircraft of densely populated villages in the Thai Hoa province of Vietnam.

	The statement said that on January 20, U.S. aircraft attacked ten densely populated villages in the Thai Hoa and Ha Trung districts of Thai Hoa province. This is a new, extremely savage crime committed by American imperialists against the Vietnamese people and a brazen provocation against the people of the world.

	The statement pointed out that this action once again exposes the "peace talks" deception of the U.S. ruling clique and further reveals the extremely cruel nature of American imperialism.

	The statement strongly protests against the above-mentioned crimes of the United States and firmly demands that the United States stop its aggression against Vietnam.

	The statement concludes that no matter how savage the actions of the U.S. aggressors, they cannot shake the iron will of the Vietnamese people to resist America and save the nation.

	Hanoi, January 23 (New China News Agency) - The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on January 22 strongly condemning the recent savage massacre of residents in the Ben Cat area of Tuy Hoa province by U.S. aggressors.

	The statement pointed out that the savage crime of the American imperialists leveling the town of Ben Cat and massacring a large number of local residents shows that they are even more brutal than the Hitler fascist bandits.

	The statement emphasized that the increasingly frenzied and brutal actions of the U.S. aggressors cannot shake the resolve of the people of South Vietnam to resist America and save the nation. The people of South Vietnam, filled with boundless hatred, will fight even more bravely and deal heavier blows to the enemy.

	The statement strongly condemns the new crimes committed by American imperialism in the Ben Cat area, firmly demands that the United States immediately stop all its massacres of the Vietnamese people, stop its war of aggression against Vietnam, and calls on all peace-loving people around the world to strongly condemn and take action to stop the bloody crimes of the U.S. aggressors.

	According to New China News Agency, the military and civilians of the six provinces of Bac Ninh, Ninh Binh, Thai Hoa, Vinh Phuc, Lang Son, and Quang Ninh in North Vietnam, filled with deep hatred for the enemy, fought bravely against American air pirates from January 19 to 23. In these battles, they shot down 14 American planes.
