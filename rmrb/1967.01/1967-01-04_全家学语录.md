During the late rice harvest period, the members of the First Production Brigade of Shengcun Village, Hengping Brigade, Enping County, Guangdong Province, agreed on a rule: no one's chickens, ducks, or geese were allowed out until the rice in the fields had been dried and collected. One day, a chicken from someone's home escaped and went into the rice field. Comrade Luo Xian, thinking it was someone else's chicken, also let out his own chickens. The other members saw this and were very displeased. Someone reported this incident to Luo Xian's husband, Zheng Dong.

That evening, during dinner, Zheng Dong said to his family, "Let's first study a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations and then eat." He then had one of his sons lead the reading. The son read a sentence, and everyone repeated it:

	"Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of complete selflessness and devotion to others is shown in his extreme dedication to his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people..."

After reading the quotation, Zheng Dong said, "Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of complete selflessness and devotion to others. But today, our family violated the brigade's rule by letting the chickens out to eat the collective's rice. What kind of thinking is this? Does it align with Chairman Mao's teachings?" Luo Xian, feeling embarrassed, said, "The chickens were let out by me. This morning, I saw some chickens in the rice field and thought they were someone else's, so I let out my own chickens. This shows that I still have selfish thoughts and have not learned from Comrade Norman Bethune's spirit of complete selflessness and devotion to others." Her son, Zheng Shengjun, added, "Mom, that's not right! Even if someone else let out their chickens, we shouldn't have let ours out! That's selfishness." Luo Xian humbly accepted her son's criticism.

Zheng Dong, seeing that his wife had recognized her mistake, happily said, "Tonight, we studied Chairman Mao's quotations and applied them well. Now, let's start eating!"

    全家学语录
    在收割晚造期间，广东省恩平县横陂公社横平大队严村第一生产队的社员，订了一条公约：禾地塘晒的谷没有收起来以前，社员饲养的三鸟一律不得放出来。一天，不知是那家的鸡闯出了笼子，走到禾地塘里去了。社员罗仙，以为是别人放的鸡，便把自己的鸡也放了出来。社员们看见了，意见很大。有人把这一情况，告诉了罗仙的丈夫郑栋。
    当天吃晚饭的时候，郑栋对家里人说，咱们先学一段毛主席语录，再吃饭。然后叫他的一个儿子领读。儿子读一句，大家跟一句：
      “白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。……”
    读了语录后，郑栋说：“毛主席教导我们，要学习白求恩同志那种毫不利己专门利人的精神。可是，今天我们家却违反队里的公约，把鸡放出去，吃了集体的谷。这是什么思想？符合毛主席的教导吗？”罗仙不好意思地说：“鸡是我放的。今天早上，我看到禾地塘里有几只鸡，以为是别人放的，便也把鸡放了出来。这说明，我还有私心，没有学到白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神。”她的儿子郑盛准接着说：“妈！你这样做可不对呀！就是别人放了鸡，我们也不能放呀！这就是自私自利。”罗仙虚心地接受了儿子的批评。
    郑栋见妻子认识了错误，高兴地说：“今晚我们结合实际学习毛主席语录，学得好，用得好。现在咱们开始吃饭吧！”
