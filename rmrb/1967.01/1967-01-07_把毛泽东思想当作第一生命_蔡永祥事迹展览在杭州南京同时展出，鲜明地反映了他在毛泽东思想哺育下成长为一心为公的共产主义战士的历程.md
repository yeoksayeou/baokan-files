The exhibition of the revolutionary deeds of Cai Yongxiang, who devoted himself wholeheartedly to the public, began on the 5th in Hangzhou. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as Red Guards, revolutionary students, and cadres from various places who came to Hangzhou on foot for revolutionary exchanges, flocked to the exhibition with excited hearts. They expressed their determination to learn from Cai Yongxiang, who devoted himself wholeheartedly to the public, and to become good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The exhibition hall is located by the West Lake. Bright red quotations from Chairman Mao, fluttering colorful banners, and a giant portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform in the main hall, all bathed the exhibition hall in a sea of red. Everyone looked up at the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, and recited the quotations from Chairman Mao in unison. "Chairman Mao is the red sun in my heart," Cai Yongxiang once said. This best expressed the feelings of the audience.

The exhibition hall displays the personal belongings and photographs of Cai Yongxiang, the martyr, as well as illustrations, vividly reflecting the brilliant journey of the martyr growing into a selfless communist warrior under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought.

The exhibition is divided into five parts. The first part focuses on introducing Cai Yongxiang's deep class feelings and boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao. Among the exhibits, the most striking is a full-body photograph of Cai Yongxiang holding the works of Chairman Mao, which was taken after he joined the unit. This photograph strongly expresses his love for Chairman Mao and the works of Chairman Mao. There is also a photograph of Cai Yongxiang's diary, recording his immense excitement upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao swimming the Yangtze River. He wrote:

"Our great leader is in such good health, which is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the world. I sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life!"

The second part of the exhibition, under the headline "Studying and Applying the 'Three Articles' with Great Zeal, Using the Revolutionary Spirit of 'Seizing the Day' to Transform One's Worldview," focuses on introducing how Cai Yongxiang eagerly studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Among the exhibits, the most moving are the more than 20,000 characters of study notes and diaries he wrote in eight months after enlisting. Nearly 10,000 characters are his reflections on studying the "Three Articles."

The third part of the exhibition focuses on introducing Cai Yongxiang's deeds of devoting himself wholeheartedly to the public, to the revolution, and to the people, and his resolve to be a guard of the bridge like Zhang Side.

The fourth part of the exhibition introduces Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds of defending Mao Zedong Thought with his life and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The striking exhibits and large-scale illustrations particularly show how Cai Yongxiang, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and tempered in the storms of class struggle, bravely sacrificed his life to foil the enemy's political conspiracies, to protect the Red Guards, to protect the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to protect the Qiantang River Bridge.

The final part of the exhibition introduces the activities of the Red Guards, the broad cadres and soldiers of the Nanjing troops, and the hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country who enthusiastically study the deeds of Cai Yongxiang.

The revolutionary masses who came to visit were all moved by Cai Yongxiang's heroic deeds. They expressed their determination to treat Mao Zedong Thought as their first life, to read Chairman Mao's books as their first need, and to make transforming their thoughts their lifelong battle mission. They vowed to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The exhibition of Cai Yongxiang's deeds also began on the 5th in Nanjing.
