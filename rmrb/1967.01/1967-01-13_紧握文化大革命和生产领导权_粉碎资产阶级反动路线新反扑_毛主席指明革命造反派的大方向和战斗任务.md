The Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai. This is the greatest concern, support, encouragement, and spur for the revolutionary rebels from Chairman Mao. Today, the revolutionary rebel organizations from various fronts such as industry, transportation, finance, commerce, culture, education, and party and government organs in Shanghai, as well as those from other places in Shanghai, jointly held a grand rally to celebrate the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram and to swear to smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. Tens of thousands of revolutionary rebel warriors from Shanghai and other places fully expressed their boundless love, loyalty, faith, and adoration for the great leader Chairman Mao. They are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and strike back at the thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary revisionist and economistic goods. They will shoulder the burdens of revolution and production, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, fully implement the great call of the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, and advance along the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to achieve new victories and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

This rally is a rally to swear to launch a comprehensive offensive against the bourgeois reactionary line under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It is a rally for the great unity and alliance of the revolutionary rebels.

At present, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai is excellent and getting better. Workers have risen up, peasants have risen up, students have risen up, and revolutionary masses in the cultural sphere and party and government organs have risen up. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is increasingly grasped by the broad revolutionary masses. The strongholds of the bourgeois reactionary line are being destroyed one by one. The revolutionary mass movements on various fronts are developing with the momentum of a surging tide and the force of thunder. The strength of the proletarian revolutionary rebels is growing, and various revolutionary organizations are further uniting under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, rallying the majority of the masses to form an irresistible revolutionary torrent. They are launching a comprehensive offensive against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few stubborn adherents of the bourgeois reactionary line, and have achieved new victories. In this excellent situation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group sent a congratulatory telegram to the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai, giving high praise to the "Urgent Notice" issued by the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai on January 9, and highly commending the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary organizations of Shanghai. It is under the great encouragement and support of the great leader Chairman Mao that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai has entered a new stage.

The square was filled with red flags. The revolutionary rebel armies, with drums and gongs, surrounded the portrait of Chairman Mao, holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts! Long live! Ten thousand years! Long live!" "Defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death!" "Grasp revolution and promote production, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!" "Down with economism!" "All laborers unite with revolutionary students, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres!" "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!"

On the rally site, the rebel warriors continuously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The enemy will not die out of its own accord. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord." "Political work is the life of all economic work. This is especially true in a period of fundamental changes in the social and economic system." They also seriously studied the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram and the editorial published in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine on January 12.

Vice Chairman Zhang Chunqiao of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and member Yao Wenyuan attended today's rally.

At the beginning of the rally, Zhang Chunqiao read the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai amid thunderous cheers.

Zhang Chunqiao excitedly told everyone: "Our great leader Chairman Mao is in excellent health! The health of Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, is also excellent!" At this, the entire audience of revolutionary rebel warriors shouted in unison for a long time: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

After Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan spoke, tens of thousands of revolutionary rebel warriors in the audience, with hearts full of excitement, unanimously passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

Representatives of various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai spoke at the rally. They excitedly said: The Central Committee's congratulatory telegram is a document of great historical significance. This is a great joy for us Shanghai revolutionary rebels, and it is also a great joy for revolutionary rebels throughout the country! They are determined to respond to the great call of the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram, unite under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, wage all-around class struggle, grasp revolution and promote production, and strike back at the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The representative of the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters said in his speech: We workers' rebels will definitely respond to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's great concern for us with actual actions! We must further implement the great alliance of the revolutionary organizations of the proletarian revolutionaries, grasp the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of socialist economy in our own hands. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, consolidate our victories, and continue to advance along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

The representative of the "Revolution and Production Frontline Joint Command Headquarters," established under the leadership of the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, reported at the rally on the arduous struggle of the broad revolutionary rebel workers on the water and land transportation lines to smash the conspiracy of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and stubborn adherents of the bourgeois reactionary line to stop water, electricity, and transportation.

He said: The revolutionary rebels resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution and promote production," seize key departments such as railways, ports, and transportation, take revolutionary measures, and quickly restored production and transportation order.

He angrily said: A few stubborn adherents of the bourgeois reactionary line used to suppress the revolution under the pretext of "promoting production." Now that the revolutionary workers have risen up, they sabotage production and the revolution. When we broad masses of worker rebels shoulder the burden of managing production, these aristocratic lords adopt the tactic of passive resistance to oppose the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deliberately causing damage to state property. We revolutionary rebels warn these aristocratic lords: You are lifting a rock to drop it on your own feet, further exposing your counter-revolutionary revisionist faces, and hastening your own downfall.

The representative of the Red Guard Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Higher Education Institutions (Red Revolutionary Committee) and the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Rebel United Committee listed many facts they recently investigated and learned about in many factories and organs, angrily exposing that a handful of power-holders within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who are taking the capitalist road and stubborn adherents of the bourgeois reactionary line have been squandering state funds to save their own skins, trying to soften the fighting spirit of the revolutionary rebels with "sugar-coated bullets," divert the direction of the struggle, adopt new forms to resist Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and turn a serious political struggle into a struggle over signatures and economic struggle, leading the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution astray onto the path of economism and welfareism. Even more viciously, they attempted to exert pressure on the Central Cultural Revolution Group and the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao. This is a new challenge, new counterattack, and new conspiracy of the bourgeois reactionary line. We, the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will not fall for their tricks. We warn the conspirators within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee: Those who oppose the proletarian revolutionary line and Chairman Mao will have no good ending, and none of your conspiracies will succeed.

The representative of the revolutionary rebel organizations in the financial and commercial departments of Shanghai jointly said in their speech: We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations for us, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated by Chairman Mao to the end!

The representative of the Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters of the Capital Red Guards (Third Headquarters) Liaison Station in Shanghai and seven other revolutionary organizations jointly said at the rally: Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the working class, represented by the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, has always firmly grasped the direction of the revolutionary struggle in Shanghai. The revolutionary rebels with the workers' rebels as the core have united the broad masses of peasants, students, revolutionary intellectuals, and other revolutionary masses, forming an invincible revolutionary force armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This is a powerful guarantee for thoroughly carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai. We will definitely respond most resolutely to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, learn from the experience of the revolutionary masses in Shanghai, unite with all revolutionary masses, repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The rally also unanimously passed a proposal to establish a liaison station for the revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai (full text see page 2).

Finally, the rally ended with the majestic song "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman." After the rally, tens of thousands of rebel warriors held a grand parade.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on January 12, the revolutionary masses in the capital warmly welcomed the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary rebel organizations of Shanghai, as well as the editorial published in the People's Daily and Red Flag magazine. They welcomed the great leader Chairman Mao's personal decision to broadcast the "Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" issued by various revolutionary organizations in Shanghai to the whole country. Revolutionary people spread the news, enthusiastically congratulated each other, and unanimously believed that this is the greatest support and encouragement from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for the revolutionary rebel organizations, and a new battle mobilization order from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the revolutionary masses throughout the country. It marks the beginning of a new stage in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

From last night to today, the capital was in a festive mood. Batch after batch of revolutionary rebel organizations, carrying the portrait of Chairman Mao, holding high red flags, singing "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman" and other songs, and beating drums and gongs, came to the reception station of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council to report the good news to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. They shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" The slogans expressing boundless love, loyalty, faith, and adoration for the great leader echoed through the sky. Slogans and big-character posters such as "Grasp revolution and promote production" and "Oppose economism and smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line" were posted all over the streets.

Members of many revolutionary rebel organizations in the capital and Red Guards enthusiastically pointed out: The "Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" jointly issued by the revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai have raised the key issues in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have united to become the core of uniting all revolutionary forces, and the revolutionary rebels themselves will grasp the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy. This has set a good example for the revolutionary rebels in the capital and throughout the country, and it is a brilliant and invincible victory of Mao Zedong Thought. It is a great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. We must humbly learn from the fearless revolutionary spirit of the comrades in the Shanghai revolutionary rebel organizations and unite with the revolutionary rebels in Shanghai and throughout the country to overthrow counter-revolutionary revisionist economism and smash the new conspiracies and counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The workers of the Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters of the Second Machine Tool Factory in Beijing deeply understood the opposition to economism and the smashing of the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the revolutionary organizations in Shanghai. They said: The revolutionary rebels have a hard backbone, sharp eyes, and hearts towards Chairman Mao. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and stubborn adherents of the bourgeois reactionary line want to lead this political struggle astray, which is absolutely impossible. We will not let their conspiracies succeed. Representatives of the Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station of the Capital Workers, the Revolutionary Rebel United Committee of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry, the Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters of the Capital Workers, and the Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Group of Part of the Capital's Higher Education Institutions to Factories held a discussion today. They said they would respond to the great call of the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram with actual actions. They said: Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee are heart to heart with us revolutionary rebels. We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, grasp revolution and promote production, overthrow economism, smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The Red Flag Combat Team of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics was one of the initiators of the "Letter to All the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice" issued by various revolutionary rebel organizations in Shanghai. When the news came, they were particularly excited. They said, the Central Committee's congratulatory telegram and editorial spoke for us. We will continue to fight, go to factories and rural areas, unite with revolutionary workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to grasp revolution and promote production. We will bury the bourgeois reactionary line and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! They worked overnight to make propaganda materials and went to Beijing Railway Station and places where workers from other provinces and cities in Beijing gathered early in the morning to propagate. The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Geological Institute's Dongfanghong Commune and Tsinghua University's Jinggangshan Detachment also took immediate action today. They went to factories and streets to propagate to workers and residents, exposing the new conspiracies of the bourgeois reactionary line, and mobilizing workers who had been misled to return to their production posts as soon as possible. Many revolutionary students of Beijing Normal University's Jinggangshan Commune also set out today to propagate in rural areas and along the railway.

In the First Machine Tool Factory in Beijing, revolutionary students propagated among the workers overnight and discussed with them. This afternoon, they held a rally with the revolutionary workers in the factory to swear to grasp revolution, promote production, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

    紧握文化大革命和生产领导权　粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑
  　毛主席指明革命造反派的大方向和战斗任务
    上海数十万革命造反战士集会誓师，北京革命群众响应中央号召向上海学习
    新华社上海十二日电　中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电，是毛主席对革命造反派最大的关怀，最大的支持，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。今天，上海工业、交通运输、财贸、文教和党政机关等各条战线的以及外地在沪的革命造反团体联合举行了盛大的欢庆中央贺电，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的誓师大会。上海和来自外地的数十万革命造反战士在大会上最充分地表达了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧把握住斗争的大方向，迎头痛击彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义货色经济主义，挑起革命和生产两副担子，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，完全实现中央贺电的伟大号召，沿着以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线继续前进，夺取新的胜利，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    这次大会，是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向资产阶级反动路线发动全面总攻击的誓师大会，是一个革命造反派大团结、大联合的大会。
    当前，上海无产阶级文化大革命形势好得很，越来越好。工人起来了，农民起来了，学生起来了，文化领域各界和党政机关革命群众起来了。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，日益为广大革命群众所掌握，资产阶级反动路线盘踞的顽固堡垒，正在一个个地被摧毁；各条战线上的革命群众运动以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力迅猛发展，无产阶级革命造反派的力量正在发展壮大，各个革命组织在毛泽东思想光辉旗帜下正在进一步联合起来，并把群众的大多数团结在一起，结成了不可阻挡的革命洪流，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，发动了总攻击，并取得了新的胜利。在这样一派大好形势下，中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体发来了贺电，对上海各革命造反团体一月九日发出的《紧急通告》作了极高的评价，对上海各革命造反组织的革命行动给予高度的赞扬。正是在伟大领袖毛主席这一鼓舞支持下，上海无产阶级文化大革命又跨进了一个新的阶段。
    人民广场上红旗漫卷。一支支革命造反大军敲锣打鼓，簇拥着毛主席的画像，手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线！”“抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑！”“打倒经济主义！”“一切劳动者同革命学生、革命知识分子、革命干部联合起来！”“把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    在大会会场上，革命造反派的战士们不停地学习毛主席的教导：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”他们还认真地学习了中央贺电和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志一月十二日发表的社论。
    中央文革小组副组长张春桥和中央文革小组成员姚文元同志参加了今天的大会。
    大会开始，张春桥同志在雷鸣般的欢呼声中，宣读了中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电。
    张春桥同志兴奋地告诉大家：我们伟大领袖毛主席的身体非常健康！毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志的身体非常健康！这时，全场革命造反派战士齐声经久不息地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    在张春桥同志和姚文元同志讲话之后，全场几十万革命造反战士怀着无比激动的心情，一致通过给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
　　上海各个革命造反组织的代表相继在大会发言。他们激动地说：中央的贺电，是一个具有重大历史意义的文件。这是我们上海革命造反派的特大喜事，也是全国革命造反派的特大喜事！他们决心响应中央贺电的伟大号召，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，革命造反派联合起来，开展全面的阶级斗争，抓革命，促生产，迎头痛击资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部代表在发言中说，我们工人造反派坚决用实际行动来回答毛主席和党中央对我们的巨大关怀！我们一定要进一步实行无产阶级革命派组织的大联合，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己手里。一定要牢牢把握住斗争的大方向，巩固胜利成果，继续沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进！
    由上海工人革命造反总司令部主持建立的“抓革命，促生产火线联合指挥部”的代表，在大会上汇报了水陆交通运输战线上的广大革命造反派工人高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，粉碎一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子使出的停水、停电、停交通的阴谋所作的艰苦斗争。
    他说，革命造反派坚决贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，抓住铁路、港务、交通运输等要害部门，采取革命措施，迅速恢复了生产和交通秩序。
    他愤慨地说：少数顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的当权派，过去借口“抓生产”来压革命，当革命工人起来造反了，他们就破坏生产，破坏革命。当我们广大工人造反派挑起了管理生产的重担，这些当权派的贵族老爷们又采取消极怠工的办法来对抗无产阶级文化大革命，蓄意让国家财产遭受损失。我们革命造反派警告这些贵族老爷们，你们这样做是搬起石头砸自己的脚，更暴露了你们自己的反革命修正主义的面目，加速自己的垮台。
    红卫兵上海市大专院校革命委员会（红革会）代表和上海市级机关革命造反联合委员会代表列举了他们最近在许多工厂、机关调查了解的大量事实，愤怒地揭露上海市委内一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，他们慷国家之慨，保自己的命，想用“糖衣炮弹”来软化革命造反派的斗志，转移斗争大方向，采用新的形式对抗毛主席的革命路线，把一场严肃的政治斗争化为签字画押的经济斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命引到经济主义，福利主义的邪路上去。更为恶毒的是企图以此对中央文革小组施加压力，对以毛主席为首的党中央施加压力。这是资产阶级反动路线的新挑战、新反扑、新阴谋。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民是不会上他们的当的。我们要警告上海市委内一小撮阴谋家，对抗无产阶级革命路线，反对毛主席的人是决没有好下场的，你们的任何阴谋都不能得逞。
    上海财贸部门各革命造反组织的代表在联合发言中激动地表示，决不辜负毛主席对我们的期望，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把毛主席亲自发动的这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    首都红卫兵革命造反总司令部（第三司令部）驻沪联络站等八个革命组织的代表在大会上联合发言说：无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，以上海工人革命造反总司令部为代表的工人阶级，一直紧紧掌握着上海革命斗争的大方向，以工人造反派为核心的各革命造反派，已经联合起广大农民、学生、革命知识分子和其他革命群众，形成了一支以毛泽东思想武装起来的攻无不克、战无不胜的革命队伍，这是彻底搞好上海无产阶级文化大革命的有力保证。我们一定最坚决地响应党中央和毛主席的伟大号召，学习上海革命群众的经验，同一切革命群众联合起来，打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    大会还一致通过了关于建立上海市革命造反派组织联络站的倡议（全文见第二版）。
    最后，大会在雄壮的《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中结束。会后，数十万造反战士举行了声势浩大的游行。
    据新华社十二日讯　首都革命群众最最热烈地欢呼中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组给上海市各革命造反团体的贺电和《人民日报》《红旗》杂志社论的发表，欢呼我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自决定向全国广播上海各革命群众组织发表的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》。革命的人们奔走相告，热情祝贺，一致认为，这是毛主席、党中央对革命群众造反组织的最大支持和最大鼓舞，是毛主席、党中央向全国革命群众发出的新的战斗动员令，它标志着我国无产阶级文化大革命开始了一个新的阶段。
    从昨晚到今天，首都一片欢腾。一批又一批革命造反组织的群众队伍，抬着毛主席画像，高举鲜红的旗帜，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》等歌曲，敲锣打鼓地来到中共中央、国务院接待站前，向最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席报喜。他们高呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”对伟大领袖无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜的口号声响彻云霄。“抓革命，促生产”，“反对经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”等大字报和大标语，贴满街头。
    首都许多革命造反组织的成员和红卫兵小将兴奋地指出：上海革命造反组织联合发表的《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》，提出了当前无产阶级文化大革命中的关键问题。他们联合起来，成为团结一切革命力量的核心，由革命造反派自己来掌握无产阶级专政的命运，掌握无产阶级文化大革命的命运，掌握社会主义经济的命运，这为我们首都的和全国的革命造反派树立了好的榜样，这是光辉的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。我们一定要虚心学习上海革命造反派同志们的大无畏的革命精神，和上海的以及全国的革命造反派联合起来，打倒反革命修正主义的经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新阴谋和新反扑。
    北京第二机床厂革命造反总部的工人们，对上海革命群众组织提出的反对经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，体会得特别深刻。他们说：革命造反派的骨头是硬的，眼睛是亮的，心是向着毛主席的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固坚持资产阶级反动路线的人，妄想把这场政治斗争引入歧途，是绝对办不到的，我们决不会让他们的阴谋得逞。首都职工红色造反总联络站、第一机械工业部革命造反联合委员会、首都职工革命造反总部、首都部分大专院校下厂联络小组等革命造反组织的部分负责人，今天还在一起举行了座谈。他们表示，决心以实际行动响应中央贺电的伟大号召。他们说，毛主席和党中央同我们革命造反派心连心，我们一定要按照毛主席的指示办事，抓革命，促生产，打倒经济主义，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    北京航空学院的红旗战斗队是参与上海各革命造反团体发表《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》的发起单位之一，消息传来，他们感到特别振奋。他们说，中央的贺电和社论说出了我们的心里话。我们还要继续斗争，要到工厂、农村中去，与革命工人和贫下中农联合起来，坚决响应毛主席抓革命，促生产的伟大号召，誓把资产阶级反动路线埋葬掉！把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！他们连夜赶制宣传品，今天一早就分别到北京火车站和外地来京工人集中居住的地方，进行宣传。北京地质学院东方红公社和清华大学井冈山兵团的革命师生，今天也紧急行动起来，他们进工厂、上街头，向工人和居民进行宣传，揭露资产阶级反动路线的新阴谋，动员因受蒙蔽而离开生产岗位的工人尽早地回到生产岗位上去。北京师范大学井冈山公社的许多革命学生，今天还出发到农村和铁路沿线去进行宣传。
    在北京第一机床厂，革命学生们连夜到工人中间去宣传，与工人一起学习和讨论。今天下午，他们又与厂里的革命工人一起召开了抓革命，促生产，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的誓师大会。
