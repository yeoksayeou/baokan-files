Japanese friends from various circles held a symposium to celebrate the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's speech supporting the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle. Chairman Mao pointed out the road to liberation for the Japanese people. Those who fear the American imperialists and fear revolution will inevitably join the Americans and Soviets to oppose China.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 21st: Japanese friends from Yamaguchi Prefecture held a symposium on the 17th to enthusiastically celebrate the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's speech on January 27, 1964, "Supporting the Japanese People's Anti-American Patriotic Just Struggle."

Some Japanese friends spoke at the symposium, enthusiastically praising the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, who has always been the most resolute in supporting the oppressed peoples in their struggle for national liberation. They unanimously pointed out: "Chairman Mao's speech is like a bright beacon, showing the Japanese people the way forward."

A standing committee member of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, Anakoshi Takayuki, said that Chairman Mao has always been passionate and resolute in supporting the struggle for national liberation by all peoples of the world. He is a true leader of the proletarian revolution who breathes with the Japanese people and all peoples of the world and shares their fate. He is a model of proletarian revolutionaries.

He said that at every critical moment in the Japanese people's struggle, Chairman Mao has clearly pointed out the road to liberation for the Japanese people. The speech Chairman Mao gave three years ago is a direct confrontation with the revisionist line. Anakoshi emphasized that if one truly cares about the fate of the Japanese nation and truly wants to liberate the Japanese people, one should, as Chairman Mao pointed out, fight against the most vicious enemy of the Japanese nation, American imperialism.

When talking about the followers of Soviet modern revisionism in Japan, he said that they talk about opposing American imperialism but are actually terrified of it. They fear the masses and oppose the revolutionary masses in their head-on struggle against American imperialism. This group of people is playing the role of a fire brigade to extinguish the flames of the people's revolution.

He said, whoever acknowledges that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese nation, as Chairman Mao said, will never be anti-China. Whoever does not genuinely oppose American imperialism will inevitably join forces with Soviet modern revisionism in some "united action" and will inevitably oppose China.

Anakoshi emphasized that at a time when the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people is about to enter a new high tide and when people all over the world are rising up to fight against American imperialism, Mao Zedong Thought is showing unprecedented vitality. He said that Chairman Mao's speech three years ago pointed out the correct direction for the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people, who are about to enter a new high tide. His speech is the ideological foundation for the Japanese people to oppose American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionism and to achieve genuine revolutionary unity. Anakoshi expressed his belief that as long as we follow the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech, we will definitely be able to further develop the mass anti-American patriotic just struggle.

The chairman of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Federation of Agricultural Workers' Unions, Oobayashi Seibei, said that in the current situation where new followers of Soviet modern revisionism have emerged in Japan, reviewing Chairman Mao's speech makes people realize even more that every word Chairman Mao said is the truth. He said that this speech further raised our level of awareness and fighting spirit.

The chairman of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Federation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Furutani Shouichirou, pointed out that Chairman Mao and the Chinese people are the most reliable friends of the Japanese people. He said that Chairman Mao understands the Japanese people the best and loves them dearly. Chairman Mao has always regarded the Japanese people as friends of the Chinese people and has extended the hand of proletarian internationalist friendship.

Furutani said that Chairman Mao's speech three years ago pointed out the correct road for the Japanese people to drive out American imperialism and strive for national liberation, and it also linked the liberation struggle of the Japanese people with the liberation struggle of all peoples of the world. Practice has proven that Chairman Mao's words are completely correct.

The chief editor of the "Chou News," Fukuda Seigou, said that Chairman Mao pointed out, "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow American imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." This sentence deeply touched the hearts of the Japanese people. Fukuda said, "When I first heard this sentence, I was deeply moved, and it is still etched in my heart." He said, "Chairman Mao is like a family member, showing great concern and support for the future of the Japanese people's national liberation."

Fukuda pointed out that countless struggles of the Japanese people have proven the truth that Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech: "American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Japanese nation." American imperialism is the root of all misfortunes for the Japanese nation. He said, therefore, the task of opposing American imperialism, as pointed out by Chairman Mao, can mobilize the broadest sections of the Japanese people.

When talking about the issue of forming a broad united front against American imperialism, Fukuda said that Chairman Mao's call for all countries and people around the world who are subjected to aggression, control, interference, and bullying by American imperialism to unite is completely correct.

　　日本各界朋友举行座谈会庆祝毛主席支持日本人民反美爱国斗争的谈话发表三周年
　　毛主席指出了日本人民解放道路
　　害怕美帝、害怕革命的人必然要联合美苏反对中国
    据新华社东京二十一日电　山口县的日本朋友十七日举行座谈会，热烈庆祝毛主席一九六四年一月二十七日发表《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》三周年。
    一些日本朋友在座谈会上发表讲话，热情赞扬全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席一贯地最坚决地支持被压迫人民争取民族解放的斗争。他们一致指出：“毛主席的谈话像一座明亮的灯塔，给日本人民指出了前进的道路。”
    山口县亚非人民团结委员会常任理事穴迫隆之说，毛主席一贯最热情地关怀和坚决地支持全世界人民争取民族解放斗争，他是同日本人民以及全世界人民同呼吸、共命运的真正无产阶级的革命领袖，是无产阶级革命家的典范。
    他说，在日本人民斗争的每一个关键时刻，毛主席都明确指出日本人民争取解放的道路。毛主席三年前发表的谈话是同修正主义路线针锋相对的。穴迫强调说，如果不是在口头上，而是真正关心日本民族的命运，真正要争取日本人民的解放，就应当根据毛主席指出的那样，同日本民族最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义进行斗争。
    他在谈到苏联现代修正主义在日本的追随者时说，他们口头上说要反对美帝国主义，但实际上对美帝国主义怕得要死。他们害怕群众，反对革命群众同美帝国主义进行针锋相对的斗争，这一伙人正在起着扑灭群众革命烈火的消防队的作用。
    他说，谁承认毛主席所说的美帝国主义是日本民族最凶恶的敌人，谁就决不会反华。谁不真心反对美帝国主义，谁就必然同苏联现代修正主义搞什么“联合行动”，就必然反对中国。
    穴迫强调指出，在目前日本人民的革命斗争将要出现一个新的高潮的时候，全世界人民正在起来进行反对美帝国主义的斗争的大好形势下，毛泽东思想更加显示出无比生命力。他说，毛主席三年前的谈话给即将进入斗争新高潮的日本人民的反美爱国斗争指出了正确方向。他的谈话是日本人民反对美帝国主义、日本反动派和现代修正主义以及实现真正的革命团结的思想基础。穴迫表示深信：只要我们遵循毛主席谈话的精神，就一定能够进一步发展群众性的反美爱国正义斗争。
    日本农业工人工会山口县联合会会长大林清美说，在当前日本出现了苏联现代修正主义的新的追随者的情况下，重温毛主席的谈话，更加使人们认识到毛主席的话句句字字是真理。他说，这篇谈话进一步提高了我们的觉悟水平和斗争勇气。
    日中友好协会（正统）山口县联合会理事长古谷庄一郎指出，毛主席和中国人民是日本人民最可靠的朋友。他说，毛主席最了解日本人民，并无限热爱日本人民。毛主席一贯地把日本人民作为中国人民的朋友，伸出了无产阶级国际主义友谊之手。
    古谷说，毛主席三年前的谈话，为日本人民指出了赶走美帝国主义、争取民族解放的正确道路，并且把日本人民的解放斗争同全世界人民的解放斗争结合起来。通过斗争实践证明，毛主席的话是完全正确的。
    《长周新闻》总编辑福田正义说，毛主席指出，“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”这句话深深打动了日本人民的心弦。福田说：“我第一次听到这句话时，就深受感动，至今还铭刻在心”。他说：“毛主席就像亲人一样，对于日本人民的民族解放的前途，寄予莫大关心和支持。”
    福田指出，日本人民无数的斗争实践证实了毛主席在谈话中所指出的真理：“美帝国主义是日本民族的最凶恶的敌人。”美帝国主义是给日本民族带来一切祸害的根源。他说，正因为如此，毛主席所指出的反对美帝国主义的任务，能够把日本各阶层人民最广泛地调动起来。
    在谈到结成反对美帝国主义的广泛的统一战线问题时，福田说，毛主席号召世界上一切受美帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和人士要联合起来，是完全正确的。
