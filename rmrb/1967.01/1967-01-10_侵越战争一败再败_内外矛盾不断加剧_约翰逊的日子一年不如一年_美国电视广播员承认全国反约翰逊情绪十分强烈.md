Chairman Mao said: To create chaos, fail, create more chaos, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic.

The Vietnam War Suffers Repeated Defeats; Internal and External Contradictions Intensify

Johnson's Days Worse Each Year

American Broadcasters Admit Strong Anti-Johnson Sentiment Nationwide

According to Xinhua News Agency, as the world's peoples enter a new year with joy and confidence, the U.S. imperialism, which has suffered heavy blows from the struggles of the world's revolutionary peoples, faces an even more bleak prospect and emits a chorus of desperate wails. In the days leading up to the New Year, American bourgeois newspapers reported in a depressed tone: "Washington and the President are having a tough time" (Los Angeles Times), "Johnson is facing a painful and difficult year" (Chicago Daily News). The United States finds that "as the new year approaches, it sees one big problem after another" (U.S. News & World Report).

What makes U.S. imperialism cry out that times are tough is, first of all, the increasingly heavy defeats it has suffered in the Vietnam War. A year-end report from the Associated Press acknowledges: Johnson's "biggest burden is the Vietnam War, which is now considered an endless and extremely difficult burden," and this war has brought about a series of "very thorny problems."

The DPA correspondent in Washington, Norte, points out: "U.S. President Johnson is facing a difficult 1967," in which he must deal with "the central issue of the Vietnam War, which is casting an increasingly dark shadow over the United States."

The Agence France-Presse correspondent Lara's New Year's Day commentary from Washington begins by saying: "The new year starts off badly," and for the prospects of the Vietnam War, "there is a pessimistic mood here."

The Associated Press correspondent Gulick admits that from the perspective of U.S. diplomacy, the defeat in Vietnam has cast a shadow over the prospects in other places.

As the Johnson administration escalates the Vietnam War, American people's dissatisfaction and opposition have also greatly intensified; and the great defeat of the U.S. in the Vietnam War has led to new developments in the infighting within the U.S. ruling class. The New York Times points out that there are critics of Johnson "all over the country," and within Johnson's own Democratic Party, there are "many people" who oppose him. A television news broadcaster, after making a wide-ranging trip, concluded: "People simply do not believe Johnson. Apart from the strong anti-Johnson sentiment I found everywhere in the country, I found nothing else." The London Daily Mail correspondent in Washington points out, "Johnson is facing a serious challenge on the Vietnam issue," and as he enters 1967, his "prestige" has fallen to its "lowest point" since he became president.

The increasingly serious financial difficulties caused by the Vietnam War are also a major problem facing Johnson. U.S. News & World Report writes: "Johnson is now facing one of the most difficult decisions of his presidency: how to raise funds to cover the expenses of the Vietnam War." According to the National Planning Association of U.S. monopoly capital, "The road in 1967 will be more difficult than in previous years."

The flourishing national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the intensifying contradictions between the United States and its allies, and the surging struggles of African Americans, among other issues, also make the Johnson administration panic-stricken and in disarray. Johnson himself, in his "Christmas message" last year, had already anxiously admitted: "We face an uncertain future. Serious problems threaten us all," and "the days ahead will not be easy."

### 侵越战争一败再败　内外矛盾不断加剧  约翰逊的日子一年不如一年  美国电视广播员承认全国反约翰逊情绪十分强烈

    毛主席说：捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。
    侵越战争一败再败　内外矛盾不断加剧
    约翰逊的日子一年不如一年
    美国电视广播员承认全国反约翰逊情绪十分强烈
    据新华社讯　在世界人民欢欣鼓舞、充满信心地进入新的一年的时候，遭到世界革命人民斗争沉重打击的美帝国主义面临着一片更加黯淡的前景，发出一片绝望的哀鸣。新年前后，美国资产阶级报刊语调低沉地报道说：“华盛顿和总统的日子难过”（《洛杉矶时报》）“约翰逊正面临着痛苦和困难的一年”（《芝加哥每日新闻》）。美国发现“在新的一年临近的时候，它看到的是一个接着一个的大问题”（《美国新闻与世界报道》）。
    使得美帝国主义叫喊日子难过的，首先是它在侵越战争中所遭到的越来越惨重的失败。美国合众国际社发出的一则年终报道承认：约翰逊的“最大的负担是越南战争，现在这场战争被认为是一个看不到尽头的、极难处理的负担”，这场战争引起了一系列“非常棘手的问题”。
    德新社驻华盛顿记者诺尔特指出：“美国总统约翰逊面临着困难的一九六七年”，在这一年里，他必须对付的“中心问题仍然是越南战争，这场战争给美国投下了越来越黑的阴影”。
    法新社记者拉腊今年元旦从华盛顿发出的一条评论，一开始就说：“新年开年不利”，对于越南战争的前景，“这里是一片悲观情绪”。
    美联社记者古利克承认，从美国外交观点来看，美国在越南的败局，使美国“在其他地方的前景笼罩上乌云。”
    随着约翰逊政府侵越战争的大“升级”，美国人民的不满和反对也大大加剧；而美国侵越战争的大失败又使美国统治集团内部的争吵有了新的发展。《纽约时报》指出，美国“全国各地”都有批评约翰逊的人，在约翰逊自己的民主党内也有“许多人”反对他。一个电视新闻广播员在作了一次广泛旅行后得出的结论是：“人们根本不相信约翰逊。我在全国各地除了发现强烈的反约翰逊的情绪之外，没有发现别的。”伦敦《每日邮报》驻华盛顿记者指出，“约翰逊在越南问题上正面临着严重的挑战”，在进入一九六七年时，他的“威信”已经下降到了他当总统以来的“最低点”。
    侵越战争引起的越来越严重的财经困难，也是约翰逊面临的一大难题。《美国新闻与世界报道》写道：“约翰逊现在正面临他担任总统以来面临的最困难的决定之一：如何筹措经费来应付越南战争开支。”据美国垄断资本组织的全国计划协会预测，“一九六七年的道路将比前几年要艰难”。
    亚、非、拉民族解放运动的蓬勃发展、美国同它的盟国之间的矛盾的加剧，以及美国黑人斗争的高涨等等，也都使约翰逊政府恐慌不安，狼狈不堪。约翰逊自己在去年的“圣诞文告”中就曾经忧心忡忡地承认：“我们面临着捉摸不定的未来。严重的问题威胁着我们大家”，“今后的日子将是不容易的”。
