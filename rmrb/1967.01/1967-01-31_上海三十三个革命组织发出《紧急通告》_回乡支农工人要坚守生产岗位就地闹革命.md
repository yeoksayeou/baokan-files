Shanghai's 33 revolutionary organizations, including the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Peasants' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, and the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Committee stationed in the countryside, issued an "Emergency Notice." They called on workers who had returned to their hometowns to support agriculture to stay at their production posts and revolt locally.

The "Emergency Notice" begins with a quote from Chairman Mao: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people."

The "Emergency Notice" states: Currently, Shanghai, like the rest of the country, is seeing a better situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary movement of peasants, with poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force, has surged. Revolutionary workers, peasants, students, cadres, and all revolutionary masses have achieved great unity, forming an irresistible revolutionary torrent that has swiftly swept away one after another stronghold of the bourgeoisie. The revolutionary rebels, in the midst of the triumphant struggle against the counter-revolutionary economic wind, have launched a comprehensive power seizure struggle. The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee has fallen into the vast ocean of people's war.

A small clique within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, who have been walking the capitalist road and stubbornly implementing the bourgeois reactionary line, have, in the past few years, stubbornly implemented a bourgeois reactionary line in the work of mobilizing and simplifying the placement of workers to support agricultural construction. They have falsified Party Central Committee documents and peddled the revisionist black goods of "regardless of whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat." They have collaborated with the single-handed wind that swept through society during the three years of natural disasters, developing capitalist forces, and attempting to restore capitalism in China. They have politically and spiritually discriminated against, marginalized, and even persecuted workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture, implementing bourgeois dictatorship. They are truly despicable!

Our great helmsman, Chairman Mao, personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The surging waves of the mass movement have spread from the cities to the countryside. Workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture, while actively participating in the rural cultural revolution, have risen up to thoroughly expose the crimes committed by a small clique within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who have been walking the capitalist road in the work of mobilizing and simplifying the placement of workers to support agricultural construction. This revolt is good! It is justified! It must be carried out thoroughly!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. Even after the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and beyond doubt. We must never relax our vigilance."

The small clique of scoundrels within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee is extremely afraid of and hates the revolt of workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture. To save their own skins, they have tried to shift the direction of the struggle, attempting to lead a serious political struggle into the wrong path of economism. They have crazily spread the counter-revolutionary economic wind from the cities to the countryside, trying to grab a lifeline in the vast ocean of people's war. They have instructed officials at all levels to mass-produce so-called "resumption of work certificates," luring a large number of workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture to move their household registrations and rush back to Shanghai to resume work; recently, they have also deliberately created disparities in the year-end distribution ratio in the countryside, attempting to incite conflicts between workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture and poor and lower-middle peasants.

The "Emergency Notice" states: At this critical moment when the revolutionary peasant movement is surging and the revolutionary rebels are achieving great unity, and when the revolutionary rebels are launching a comprehensive power seizure struggle from the cities to the countryside, these bourgeois lords are doing this to incite conflicts between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas. They are plotting to overthrow the revolutionary rebels who have just seized power in the cities and countryside; they are plotting to sabotage the worker-peasant alliance and strangle the revolutionary peasant movement; they are plotting to sabotage agricultural production and directly resist Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Their ultimate goal is to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat. These scoundrels have evil intentions and vicious methods. We must promptly expose these scoundrels' plots and tricks and smash any new counterattacks by the bourgeois reactionary line! For this purpose, we issue the following emergency notice:

1. Workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture and have not yet come to Shanghai must not leave their agricultural production posts; those who have already come to Shanghai (including those who have "resumed work") must quickly return to the countryside in batches. The revolutionary rebels in the transportation and other relevant departments must actively and enthusiastically provide convenience for workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture to quickly return to their agricultural production posts.

2. Workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture must stay at their production posts and revolt locally. They must unite, fight, and win together with the local revolutionary poor and lower-middle peasants. They must thoroughly expose the crimes of the small clique within the Party who have been walking the capitalist road, thoroughly expose the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly expose the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists; together with the broad revolutionary peasants, they must seize all power from those Party members who have been walking the capitalist road. At the same time, they must strengthen the current "five winters" work (winter plowing, winter fertilizer accumulation, winter storage, winter field management, and winter water conservation) to lay a solid foundation for this year's agricultural harvest and strive to be models of "grasp revolution, promote production."

3. All certificates issued in violation of state policies by officials during the cultural revolution movement are null and void; all funds, including subsidies (excluding appropriate living subsidies), back pay, and travel expenses, issued in violation of financial regulations by officials through various means to workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture, must be borne by these officials, who must be ordered to take responsibility for recovering them (in installments if necessary).

4. Those who have promoted counter-revolutionary economism and arbitrarily used production funds to incite the masses to leave their production posts must be exposed and handed over to the masses for criticism and struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must advocate considering the overall situation. Every Party member, every local work, every statement or action, must take the interests of the whole Party as the starting point and must not violate this principle under any circumstances."

We are confident that the problems in the placement of workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture can be gradually resolved according to the instructions of the Central Committee. Revolutionary rebel organizations of workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture, based on revolutionary needs, can appoint a few representatives to maintain regular, extensive, and close contact with workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture, continuing to expose and settle accounts with the crimes committed by the small clique within the Party who have been walking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who have insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line in the work of simplifying the placement and mobilizing workers to support agriculture. We are confident that revolutionary peasants will warmly welcome workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture to return to the countryside to fight together. Revolutionary comrades must heighten their vigilance and beware of class enemies sowing discord and destroying the unity between workers who have returned to their hometowns to support agriculture and revolutionary peasants.

We believe that the spirit of this "Emergency Notice" is equally applicable to workers supporting construction in other places, knowledge youth going to the mountains and countryside and supporting construction in other places, urban residents supporting agriculture and moving to other places, and medical workers settling in the countryside. The "Emergency Notice" concludes by saying: All revolutionary rebels in Shanghai, let us unite more closely under the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight bravely to thoroughly smash the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly shatter the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and seize political, cultural, production, and economic power!

　　上海三十三个革命组织发出《紧急通告》
　　回乡支农工人要坚守生产岗位就地闹革命
    新华社上海三十日电　上海工人革命造反总司令部、上海农民革命造反总司令部筹备委员会、上海在农下放工人革命委员会等上海和外地驻沪的三十三个革命组织发出《紧急通告》，呼吁回乡支农工人坚守农业生产岗位，就地大闹文化革命。
    《紧急通告》文前，引用了毛主席的语录：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    《紧急通告》说：当前，上海和全国一样，无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好。以贫下中农为主体的革命农民运动已经蓬勃兴起。革命的工人、农民、学生、机关干部和一切革命群众实现了大联合，汇成一股不可阻挡的革命洪流，迅猛地冲垮一个又一个资产阶级顽固堡垒。革命造反派在抵制反革命经济主义黑风斗争的凯歌声中，展开了全面的夺权斗争。上海市委已陷入人民战争的汪洋大海之中。
    上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线的家伙，前几年在动员和精简安置工人支援农业建设的工作上，顽固地执行了一条资产阶级反动路线，篡改党中央文件，拚命地贩卖“不管白猫、黑猫，只要能抓耗子就是好猫”的修正主义黑货，配合三年自然灾害期间社会上刮起的单干风，发展资本主义势力，妄图在中国实行资本主义复辟。他们在政治上、精神上歧视、排挤甚至迫害回乡支农工人，实行资产阶级专政。真是混蛋透顶！
    我们伟大的舵手毛主席亲自发动和领导了伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，汹涌澎湃的群众运动浪潮从城市发展到农村。回乡支农工人在积极参加农村文化大革命的同时，纷纷起来大造上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，彻底清算资产阶级臭老爷们在动员和精简安置工人支援农业建设工作上所犯下的滔天罪行。这个反造得好！造得对！非造彻底不可！
    毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    上海市委内一小撮混蛋，对回乡支农工人起来造反怕得要命，恨得要死。他们为了保住自己的狗命，转移斗争大方向，妄图把一场严肃的政治斗争引入经济主义的邪道，疯狂地把反革命经济主义黑风从城市刮到农村，妄想在人民战争的汪洋大海里捞到一根救命稻草。他们指使各级当权派大肆印发所谓“复工证明书”，诱骗大批回乡支农工人迁户口，涌入上海复工复职；最近，他们又在农村年终分配比例上故意制造差别，企图挑起回乡支农工人和贫下中农之间的对立。
    《紧急通告》说：正当革命农民运动兴起之时，正当革命造反派实行大联合之际，正当革命造反派从城市到农村全面开展夺权斗争的时刻，这些资产阶级老爷这样做，就是要挑起工农之间、城乡之间的对立，阴谋搞垮在城市和农村刚刚掌握政权的革命造反派；就是要破坏工农联盟，扼杀革命农民运动；就是要破坏农业生产，直接对抗毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针。他们根本目的，就是要破坏无产阶级文化大革命，破坏无产阶级专政。这一小撮混蛋用心险恶，手段毒辣。我们必须及时戳穿这些混蛋的阴谋诡计，粉碎资产阶级反动路线的任何新反扑！为此，我们特发出如下紧急通告：
    一、凡尚未来上海的回乡支农工人不要离开农业生产岗位；凡已来上海的回乡支农工人（包括已经“复工复职”的），应尽快地分期分批返回农村。交通运输部门，以及其他各有关部门的革命造反派应当积极地、热情地为回乡支农工人迅速返回农业生产岗位提供方便。
    二、回乡支农工人必须坚守生产岗位，就地大闹革命。和当地革命的贫下中农团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起。大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，大造地、富、反、坏、右的反；和广大革命农民一道，从那些党内走资本主义道路当权派的手里把权统统夺过来。同时，必须加强当前的五冬工作（冬耕、冬季积肥、冬季储藏、冬季田管、冬季水利），为今年的农业丰收打下坚实的基础，争当“抓革命，促生产”的模范。
    三、凡是当权派在文化革命运动中违反国家政策，胡乱签发的证明通通作废；凡是由当权派违反财政规定，通过这样或那样的方式发放给回乡支农工人的补助费（适当的生活补助费除外）、补发工资及串连费用等资金，一律由这些当权派承担责任，并责令他们负责追回（可分期分批）。
    四、对于那些推行反革命经济主义，擅自动用生产基金，煽动群众离开生产岗位的罪魁祸首，应该揪出来，交给群众批判斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“要提倡顾全大局。每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”
    我们深信，回乡支农工人安置工作中的问题，是完全可以按中央的指示逐步解决的。各回乡支农工人革命造反组织，根据革命的需要，可以推派少数代表和回乡支农工人保持经常广泛和密切的联系，继续揭发和清算党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，在精简安置和动员工人支援农业的工作上犯下的滔天罪行。我们深信，革命农民一定会热烈地欢迎回乡支农工人返回农村，共同战斗。革命的同志务必提高警惕，谨防阶级敌人从中挑拨离间，破坏回乡支农工人和革命农民之间的团结。
    我们认为，本《紧急通告》的精神对于支援外地建设的工人，上山下乡和支援外地建设的知识青年，支援农业和迁往外地的城市居民以及到农村落户的医务工作者等人员，都是同样适用的。《紧急通告》最后说，全上海的革命造反派，让我们在伟大的毛泽东思想红旗指引下，更紧密地联合起来，团结起来，为彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，彻底砸烂上海市委，夺取政治、文化、生产、经济大权而英勇战斗吧！
