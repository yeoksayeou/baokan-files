    I Will Always Be by Chairman Mao's Side
    Soldiers Liu Tingbao and Liu Fang hold the Little Red Book tightly in their hands, with Chairman Mao's teachings written inside. Each word and sentence shines with golden light, illuminating the heart with the radiance of truth. In the morning, we read it once, and the winds of the five continents stir within our chests. The responsibility of world revolution is heavy, and we carry a burden of ten thousand jin on our shoulders. On the battlefield, we bring the Little Red Book, and the battle cries shake the heavens. Hatred is concentrated on the bayonet, and for the revolution, we train hard. On the march, we bring the Little Red Book, and we move swiftly like a gust of wind. Clearing the way with songs of high spirits, we face countless difficulties without hindrance! In the fields, we bring the Little Red Book, and with both hands, we build "Dazhai." Over thousands of miles of wasteland, the scent of rice wafts, and we sing a song of Nanyuan. At work, we bring the Little Red Book, and our energy is boundless. The hammer strikes with a ringing sound, smashing the old world to pieces! When spreading propaganda, we bring the Little Red Book, and red light illuminates the rivers and mountains. It is the people who raise us, and we will forever be the people's servants. We never part from the Little Red Book, and Chairman Mao always guides us. Who says the Beijing unit is thousands of miles away? I will always be by Chairman Mao's side!
