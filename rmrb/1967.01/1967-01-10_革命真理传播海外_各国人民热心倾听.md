I listen to Beijing Radio's broadcasts every day, especially paying attention to the broadcasts of Chairman Mao's quotations. The quotations of the great leader Chairman Mao are especially needed by the broad masses of oppressed people who are still under the yoke of imperialism and colonialism today.

It is very good to broadcast Chairman Mao's quotations before each news broadcast. At the same time, broadcasting how people apply Chairman Mao's quotations and works in actual production and study has great reference value and is very helpful for my study of Chairman Mao's works.

Recently, the broadcasting of Chairman Mao's quotations has provided a very good opportunity for learning. The method of looking at problems and the viewpoint of thinking about problems are very clear; it is very useful for judging what is right and what is wrong in everything that is happening now.

	Japan		Hirai

I hope that Beijing Radio will continue to broadcast Chairman Mao's quotations in the future and hope to broadcast them more times. After listening to each broadcast, I think about and understand them myself. I think that Chairman Mao's quotations are the compass for revolutionary people.

	Japan		Uenishi

Beijing Radio broadcasting a quotation from Chairman Mao at the beginning of each broadcast is such a good idea! Although these words were said a long time ago, they still have great significance now, especially the words "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers."

	Belgium		Saelmont

I like the recent practice of Beijing Radio starting programs with Chairman Mao's quotations. Listening to and learning Chairman Mao's thoughts is the most important need of the people.

	United Kingdom		Pierce

I welcome your practice of broadcasting Chairman Mao's quotations before starting the news in your broadcasts. I am increasingly convinced that Mao Zedong Thought has immense and boundless power.

	West Germany		Hahn

In your broadcasts, I heard Chairman Mao's quotations. To carry out the proletarian revolution, we must unite under the banner of the Marxist-Leninist party. Mao Zedong Thought is the best thought for us to put our hopes into practice.

    革命真理传播海外  各国人民热心倾听
    我每天都收听北京电台的广播，特别注意收听毛主席语录。伟大领袖毛泽东的语录对于今天仍然处在帝国主义和殖民主义枷锁下的受压迫的广大人民群众来说，特别需要。

    在每次播新闻之前播毛主席语录，非常好。同时广播人们怎样把毛主席语录和毛主席著作活用在实际生产上和学习上。这很有参考价值，对我学习毛主席著作非常起作用。

    最近开始广播毛主席的语录，是个很好的学习机会。看问题的方法，思考问题的观点，非常明确；对判断现在所发生的一切，什么是错的，什么是对的，非常起作用。
                                    日本　平井
    希望北京电台今后永远广播毛主席语录，并希望多播几次，每次收听后，自己思考体会。我认为毛主席语录都是革命人民的方向盘。

    北京电台在每次广播的开始，播送一条毛主席语录，这是多么好的想法啊！虽然这些话是在很久以前讲的，但它现在仍含有伟大的意义，特别是“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎”这段话。
                                    比利时　赛尔蒙
    我喜欢北京电台最近以毛主席语录来开始节目的做法。听到和学习毛主席的思想是人们最重要的需要。
                                    英国　皮尔斯
    我欢迎你们在广播里开始报道新闻前播送毛主席语录。我越来越确信毛泽东思想有着巨大的、无穷的威力。
                                    西德　汉恩
    在你们的广播中，我听到了毛主席语录。为了进行无产阶级革命，必须团结在马列主义政党的旗帜下。毛泽东思想是使我们把希望付诸实践的最好的思想。
