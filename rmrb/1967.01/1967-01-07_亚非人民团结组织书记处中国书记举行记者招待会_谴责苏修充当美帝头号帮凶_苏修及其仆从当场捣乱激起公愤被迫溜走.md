The Chinese Secretary of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, Liangeng, held a press conference here on January 3. He spoke in support of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against U.S. imperialism and for national liberation. During the conference, a small group of Soviet modern revisionists caused disruptions, attempting to obstruct Liangeng's speech. This incident once again exposed the Soviet modern revisionists as the number one accomplice of the common enemy of the world's peoples, U.S. imperialism.

Liangeng said in his speech, "Based on the experience of the past year's struggle, the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have recognized that to oppose U.S. imperialism, they must also oppose modern revisionism." He pointed out, "Modern revisionists have always used their strategy of false support, true betrayal, false anti-imperialism, true capitulation, and false unity, true division. They have degenerated into the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism."

The Soviet revisionists and their followers who attended the press conference caused a great disturbance, attempting to obstruct the Chinese Secretary's speech. This shameless act aroused the indignation of the attendees. In the end, these Soviet revisionists and their small group of followers slunk away from the venue amidst a chorus of "traitor, shameless" from the attendees.

After the Chinese Secretary's speech, the Afro-Asian freedom fighters gave him a warm round of applause. Some came forward to shake his hand. Journalists eagerly requested copies of Liangeng's speech and materials on the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism led by the United States and its accomplices. The Afro-Asian freedom fighters praised the Chinese Secretary's firm stance in condemning U.S. imperialism and exposing Soviet modern revisionism.

    亚非人民团结组织书记处中国书记举行记者招待会
    谴责苏修充当美帝头号帮凶
    苏修及其仆从当场捣乱激起公愤被迫溜走
    据新华社开罗电　亚非人民团结组织书记处中国书记梁耕三日在这里举行的一次记者招待会上发表讲话，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民为反对美帝国主义、争取民族解放而进行的革命斗争。当时会场上有一小撮苏联现代修正主义者进行捣乱，企图阻止梁耕的讲话，从而再一次暴露了苏联现代修正主义者是世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义的头号帮凶。
    梁耕在讲话中说：“根据过去一年的斗争经验，亚非拉人民认识到，要反对美帝国主义，必须反对现代修正主义。”他指出，“而现代修正主义者一直在使用他们的假支持、真出卖、假反帝、真投降和假团结、真分裂的反革命两手策略。他们已经堕落成为美帝国主义的头号帮凶。”
    参加记者招待会的苏联修正主义者及其仆从大肆捣乱，企图阻止中国书记的讲话。这种无耻行径引起了与会者的公愤。最后，这些苏联修正主义者及其一小撮追随者在与会者发出的一片“叛徒，无耻”的指责声中，灰溜溜地逃出了会场。
    在中国书记的讲话结束后，亚非自由战士为他热烈鼓掌。有些人走上前去同他握手。新闻记者们纷纷要求梁耕发给他们发言稿和关于亚非拉人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争资料。亚非自由战士盛赞中国书记谴责美帝国主义和揭露苏联现代修正主义的坚定立场。
