Chinese Women's Delegation Receives Red Flags from Japanese Friends

NEW YORK, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) — During their visit to Japan, the Chinese Women's Delegation received nearly 40 red flags from Japanese friends. On these red flags, Japanese friends wrote thousands of words expressing their boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their high praise for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

A Japanese friend from Kyoto, Mr. Kondō, wrote on a red flag: "Long live the great leader and great helmsman Chairman Mao Zedong!"

A printer from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Mr. Morigami, wrote on a red flag: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for all peoples of the world."

Mr. Yoshida from Kyoto wrote on a red flag: "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

Revolutionary youth from the western part of Yamaguchi Prefecture wrote on a red flag: "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the struggle against imperialism and revisionism through to the end! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

Three sons of a worker from Yokosuka City made three precious gifts with great care to express their love for Chairman Mao and presented them to the delegation. The eldest son, who is 14 years old, carefully drew a half-body portrait of Chairman Mao and wrote beneath it: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Cultural Revolution!" His 12-year-old second son wrote a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations in neat Japanese characters. The youngest son, who is only 8 years old, also drew a half-body portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform.

A young woman working in a hospital in Yamaguchi Prefecture said to the delegation: "We greet Chairman Mao. We wish Chairman Mao eternal health." She presented a white work uniform signed by many people to the delegation. She said that everyone who signed the uniform loves Chairman Mao and the new China.

Women from a village in Yamaguchi Prefecture eagerly wanted to study the works of Chairman Mao but could not buy many books at the moment. Therefore, they made steel plates and printed Mao's works themselves. They have already printed "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and other works of Chairman Mao. A friend leading the study said that the peasants here are actively studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan."

    赠红旗　颂领袖
　　日本人民祝愿毛主席万寿无疆
    新华社东京电　中国妇女代表团在访问日本期间，收到日本朋友赠送的三十几面红旗。日本朋友在这些红旗上，写下千言万语，表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的高度赞扬。
    京都的日本朋友近藤在红旗上写道：“祝伟大的领袖、伟大的舵手毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”
    山口县的一位名叫森上的印刷工人在红旗上写道：“毛泽东思想是全世界人民的指路明灯。”京都的吉田在红旗上写道：“毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的顶峰。”
    山口县西部地区的革命青年在一面红旗上写道：“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反帝反修斗争进行到底！无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！”
    横须贺市一位工人的三个儿子，为了表达他们对毛主席的热爱，精心制作了三件珍贵的礼品，送给了代表团。这位工人的十四岁的大儿子，精心绘制了一张毛主席的半身像，在像下面写上：“毛主席万岁！文化大革命万岁！”。他的十二岁的二儿子用日文端端正正写了一段毛主席语录。最小的儿子刚刚八岁，也画了一张毛主席穿军装的半身像。
    山口县的一个在医院工作的女青年，曾向代表团说：“我们问候毛主席。祝毛主席永远健康”。她把一件签满名字的白色工作服献给了代表团。她说，所有在这件衣服上签名的人都热爱毛主席，热爱新中国。
    山口县一个农村的妇女们渴望学习毛主席著作，可是一时无法买到许多书，因此，她们就自己动手刻钢板，油印毛主席著作。她们已经刻印了《纪念白求恩》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》等毛主席的著作。领导这一学习的一位朋友说，这里的农民正在积极地学习毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》这一光辉著作。
