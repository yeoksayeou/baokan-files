Workers and students participating in production at Wuhan Steel Company, with hearts full of love for Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, warmly welcomed the heroic comrades from the front lines of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism—the military delegation from Albania led by Bekir Balluku, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, and Hito Çako, member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Head of the Political Department of the Albanian People's Army.

At around 9 a.m. on the 21st, as Bekir Balluku and the entire delegation entered the red steel city of Wuhan Steel, thousands of revolutionary workers and students waiting at the company gate enthusiastically waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and held up bright red flags, beating drums and gongs, shouting in unison: "Warmly welcome the Albanian military delegation!" "Long live the friendship between China and Albania!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

Many revolutionary workers and students presented their beloved portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and red armbands to the Albanian comrades. Bekir Balluku held up a portrait of Chairman Mao and shouted in Chinese: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" The excited crowd shouted in unison: "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

The Albanian military delegation then visited the rolling mill, blast furnace, and other factories. Wherever they went, they were greeted with great enthusiasm. The hosts and guests held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting together: "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong," "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" The entire steel city was filled with the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania.

Before leaving, Bekir Balluku addressed more than ten thousand revolutionary workers and students gathered in the square.

Comrade Balluku said, "Our military delegation has been in the great socialist China led by Chairman Mao for ten days. It is like being at home. Our two countries share the common ideal of building socialism and communism and the common task of fighting against American imperialism and modern revisionism led by the Khrushchev renegade clique in Moscow to defend Marxism-Leninism and the world revolution. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist and dear friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao Zedong, great socialist China has achieved tremendous successes in socialist construction, transforming itself from a backward country into a powerful socialist country with a developed heavy industry and advanced agriculture.

Comrade Balluku enthusiastically praised the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. He said, "We have seen that the proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, has made tremendous progress. This revolution has great historical significance for China, for the communist movement and the workers' movement in the world. It is you, the Party and dear Comrade Mao Zedong, who enrich Marxism-Leninism in theory and practice. The Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is developing along the correct path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong and will surely achieve its ultimate goal. Imperialists and revisionists, enemies of socialism and communism, enemies of the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China, are all afraid of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. Because the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has foiled the enemy's plot to produce revisionism and restore capitalism in China.

He said, "The fighting edge of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is directed against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a handful of people who stubbornly oppose the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong is the correct revolutionary line, the revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist line for building socialism and communism in China. Those who oppose this line are not Marxist-Leninists, not revolutionaries, they are counter-revolutionaries, and we should wage an uncompromising struggle against such people.

Comrade Balluku said, "Dear worker comrades, in the days since we arrived in China, we have seen that the fundamental feature of China, which is undergoing the proletarian cultural revolution, is that the Chinese working class, laboring peasants, brave revolutionary youth and soldiers, cadres, and the working people of the whole country are fighting and unbreakably united around the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong. They have become the steel pillars of the dear Chairman Mao's line. Recently, the bourgeois counter-revolutionary line has launched a new counterattack, using revisionist economism to oppose the Marxist-Leninist line of your Party and Chairman Mao. The bourgeois revisionist counter-revolutionaries are miserable creatures; they are weeds. They spread bourgeois counter-revolutionary ideas, and their evil deeds will not work in the face of the brave working class. We must uproot revisionist ideas. In the process of revolution and socialist construction in our two countries, we are not motivated by material incentives or personal interests first. We put Marxist-Leninist ideology first, the teachings of our great leaders Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha first, revolutionary political ideology first, revolutionary enthusiasm first. Our great slogan is to serve the people. In the construction of socialism and communism in our two countries and the struggle for world revolution, Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology for our revolutionary actions. The workers of Shanghai took correct revolutionary Marxist-Leninist actions and smashed the new counterattack of a handful of people who insisted on the bourgeois reactionary line and revisionist economism. Comrade Mao Zedong recently congratulated the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai and believed that their actions were completely correct revolutionary actions. You glorious comrades in Wuhan, responding to and learning from this revolutionary action, I, on behalf of the Albanian military delegation, congratulate you revolutionary rebels who are accurately implementing Mao Zedong Thought.

He also said, "Revolutionary rebel worker comrades, you have firmly seized the fate of the proletarian cultural revolution with your own hands, and you are extensively and deeply carrying out this revolution. We see this enthusiasm reflected in all your actions here in Wuhan Steel. You tap into internal potential, reduce costs, and have completed and overfulfilled the tasks assigned by the Party. This shows that you have implemented Chairman Mao's great call to 'grasp revolution, promote production.' We wish you the best in this regard.

Comrade Balluku, in praising the fighting friendship between the peoples of the two countries, pointed out that there is a deep revolutionary friendship between our two countries, created by our two parties and our two countries' leaders, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Comrade Balluku finally shouted, "Long live the great revolutionary thought of Comrade Mao Zedong! Forward! Forever forward under the guidance and leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong!" He also shouted in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

At this moment, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

On the evening of the 20th, the leadership of the Wuhan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a welcome banquet.

Comrade Bekir Balluku, Comrade Hito Çako, and other Albanian comrades, accompanied by Wang Shusheng, member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Minister of Defense, and Yang Xiushan, responsible for the Wuhan Military Region, watched the performance.

    巴卢库同志赞扬我国革命造反派掌握了文化大革命的命运
　　谁反对毛主席的革命路线谁就是反革命
    据新华社武汉二十二日电　武汉钢铁公司的革命职工和参加生产劳动的革命师生，怀着对毛主席和恩维尔·霍查同志无限热爱的心情，热烈欢迎来自反帝反修最前线的英雄战友——由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席兼国防部长贝基尔·巴卢库和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任希托·恰科率领的阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团全体同志。
    二十一日上午九时许，当贝基尔·巴卢库同志和代表团全体成员刚走进红钢城——武钢时，等候在公司门前的数千名革命职工和革命师生，热情地挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高举着鲜艳的红旗，敲锣打鼓，齐声高呼：“热烈欢迎阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团！”“中阿两国友好万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
  “恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”许多革命职工和革命师生，将自己心爱的伟大领袖毛主席画像和红色臂章分别赠送给阿尔巴尼亚同志们。贝基尔·巴卢库同志手举毛主席画像，用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”欢腾的人群也齐声高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    接着，阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团的同志们参观了轧钢、高炉等厂，他们所到之处，都受到了极其热烈的欢迎。宾主高举红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，共同欢呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔”“恩维尔—毛泽东”，“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”整个钢城充满了中阿两国人民的战斗友谊。
    阿尔巴尼亚的同志们临别前，贝基尔·巴卢库同志向汇集在广场的一万多名革命职工和革命师生讲了话。
    巴卢库同志说，我们军事代表团到兄弟的中华人民共和国已经十天了。在伟大的毛泽东的社会主义中国，就像在我们自己家里一样。我们两国有着建设社会主义和共产主义的共同理想，有着反对美帝国主义和反对以莫斯科赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团为首的现代修正主义，保卫马克思列宁主义和世界革命的共同斗争任务。伟大的社会主义中国，在卓越的马克思列宁主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的朋友毛泽东为首的、光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设中有着巨大的成就，中国已经从过去落后的国家变成拥有重工业和先进农业的强大的社会主义国家。
    巴卢库同志极大热情地赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，我们看到了以毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命有巨大的发展，这场革命对中国、对世界的共产主义运动和工人运动具有重大的历史意义。正是你们党和亲爱的毛泽东同志在理论上和实践上丰富着马克思列宁主义。中国无产阶级文化大革命正沿着毛泽东同志所指出的正确的道路发展着，它每天都在取得胜利，并且必将实现它的最后目的。帝国主义者和修正主义者，社会主义和共产主义的敌人，中国人民和中国共产党的敌人，都很害怕中国的无产阶级文化大革命。因为中国无产阶级文化大革命使敌人企图在中国产生修正主义、复辟资本主义的阴谋遭到了破产。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的斗争锋芒是针对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和顽固地反对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的一小撮人。以毛泽东同志为代表的革命路线是正确的革命路线，是革命的、马克思列宁主义的、在中国胜利地建设社会主义和共产主义的路线。反对这条路线，他就不是马克思列宁主义者，不是革命者，他就是反革命，对这样的人应该进行无情的斗争。
    巴卢库同志说，亲爱的工人同志们，我们来到中国以后的几天，到处看到正在进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国的基本特点是：中国的工人阶级、劳动农民、英勇的革命青年和战士、干部，全国劳动人民战斗地、牢不可破地团结在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的周围，他们成了亲爱的毛主席路线的钢铁般的支柱。最近资产阶级反革命路线又搞了一个新反扑，用修正主义的经济主义来反对你们党和毛泽东主席的马克思列宁主义路线，资产阶级修正主义反革命分子是可怜虫，他们是毒草，他们散布资产阶级反革命思想，他们这种罪恶行动在英勇的工人阶级面前是行不通的。对于修正主义思想，我们就应该连根铲除。在我们两国进行革命和社会主义建设过程中，我们不是物质刺激，不是个人利益第一。我们是马克思列宁主义思想第一，我们伟大的领袖毛泽东和恩维尔·霍查的教导第一，革命的政治思想第一，革命干劲第一，我们的伟大口号就是为人民服务。我们两国在进行社会主义和共产主义建设以及争取世界革命的胜利，马克思列宁主义的毛泽东思想是领导我们进行革命行动的思想。上海工人采取正确的革命的马克思列宁主义的行动，粉碎了一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的人的修正主义经济主义的新反扑。毛泽东同志最近向上海革命造反派表示祝贺，并且认为他们的行动是完全正确的革命行动。你们武汉的光荣的同志们，响应和学习这个革命行动，我代表阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团同志们，向正在准确地执行毛泽东思想的你们革命造反派表示祝贺。
    他还说，革命造反派工人同志们，你们用双手紧紧掌握了无产阶级文化大革命的命运，你们正在广泛地深入地进行着这场革命，我们在武钢看到这种干劲反映在你们一切行动之中。你们挖掘内在潜力，降低成本，完成和超额完成了党所交给你们的任务，这说明你们贯彻了毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，我们对此向你们表示良好的祝愿。
    巴卢库同志在赞扬两国人民的战斗友谊时指出，我们两国之间有着由我们两党和我们两国领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志所缔造的深厚的革命友谊。
    巴卢库同志最后高呼：“毛泽东同志伟大革命思想万岁！”“在毛泽东同志教导、领导下前进！前进！永远前进！”他并用中国话高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    这时，全场响起了暴风雨般的掌声，不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”
    二十日晚上，中国人民解放军武汉部队领导机关举行了欢迎晚会。
    贝基尔·巴卢库同志、希托·恰科同志等阿尔巴尼亚的同志们，在中共中央委员、国防部副部长王树声和武汉部队负责人杨秀山等陪同下观看了演出。
