Mao Zedong Thought is gaining deeper understanding and acceptance worldwide. This is evident in the story of a worker named Sidibe Kalilu from Mali (right) and his brothers, who spend their Sundays at home studying the works of Chairman Mao. They say, "To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary spirit. Revolutionaries must seriously study Chairman Mao's works." Therefore, the brothers have organized themselves to read Chairman Mao's books every day.
