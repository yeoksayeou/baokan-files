The Liberation Army of South Vietnam has achieved new victories in the new year. On the 10th, they launched a fierce attack on the U.S. military airfield in Pleiku, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Near Saigon, they sank a U.S. giant dredger.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 12th, the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam launched another fierce attack on the U.S. invasion forces' Pleiku airfield on the 10th. This is the fourth attack on this airfield by the Liberation Armed Forces following the night attack on the 6th.

The report quoted a U.S. military spokesman in Saigon as saying that the attack by the Liberation Armed Forces lasted for an hour, causing serious damage to the airfield. The U.S. invasion forces on the airfield were in chaos under the fierce artillery fire of the Liberation Armed Forces, scrambling to escape.

According to a broadcast by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam on the 11th, the Liberation Army of Gia Lai Province in South Vietnam launched a fierce attack on the U.S. invasion forces' airbase in Pleiku on the night of the 6th, achieving brilliant results. Preliminary reports indicate that after 30 minutes of intense battle, they destroyed nearly 60 enemy aircraft, damaged many more, and killed 155 U.S. soldiers, including pilots and technical personnel.

In addition, five large ammunition depots and dozens of weapon and military supply warehouses were hit and set on fire.

The Pleiku U.S. Air Force base includes two airfields, as well as pilot and technical personnel quarters, air force logistics areas, and warehouse districts. On the night of the 6th, the Liberation Army's artillery units coordinated closely with the assault forces to launch a comprehensive attack on this base. The Liberation Army's shells accurately hit the targets, causing the entire base to be engulfed in thick smoke, flames soaring into the sky, continuous explosions shaking the earth, and raging fires burning throughout the day.

Under the surprise attack by the Liberation Army, the enemy was paralyzed. The U.S. soldiers on guard in the air force logistics areas and warehouse districts were all annihilated, and some U.S. pilots and technical personnel were also killed. The Liberation Army also captured an American forward outpost to the north of the airfield.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, Saigon: On the 9th, the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam blew up one of the world's largest dredgers, the U.S. dredger "Jamaica Bay," on a river near Saigon.

According to Western news agencies, the dredger is 170 feet long and was "expanding a waterway leading to a new secret U.S. base in the Mekong Delta." The sinking of the dredger "partially blocked a waterway on the Mekong River, 35 miles southwest of Saigon," and the Americans on board suffered casualties.

    据新华社河内十二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方解放武装力量十日再次猛烈袭击美国侵略军的波来古机场。这是解放武装力量紧接着六日夜间袭击这个机场后的第四次袭击。
    消息援引西贡美军发言人的话透露，解放武装力量的这次袭击持续了一个小时，给机场造成了严重损失。机场上的美国侵略军在解放武装力量的猛烈炮火下，乱作一团，纷纷争相逃命。
    新华社河内十一日电据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方嘉莱省解放军六日夜间猛烈袭击波来古美国侵略军的空军基地，取得辉煌战果。据初步消息，他们经过三十分钟的激烈战斗，共击毁敌机近六十架，击伤多架，消灭包括飞行员和技术人员在内的美军一百五十五名。

    波来古美国空军基地，包括有两个机场，以及飞行员和技术人员宿舍、空军后勤地区和仓库区。六日夜间，解放军的炮兵部队同突击部队紧密配合，向这个基地展开全面进攻。解放军的炮弹准确地命中了目标，使整个基地顿时浓烟四起，火光冲天，连续不断的爆炸声震天动地，熊熊的烈火烧了一整天。
    在解放军的奇袭下，敌人陷于瘫痪状态，在空军后勤地区和仓库区放哨的美军被全部歼灭，部分美国飞行员和技术人员也被歼灭。解放军还攻克了机场北面的一个美国侵略军的前沿据点。
