In 1966, under the impetus of the socialist education movement in the countryside and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of peasant masses in China actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of changing heaven and earth to an even greater extent. They achieved tremendous new successes in agricultural land construction, which powerfully promoted the all-round development of agriculture in various places.

The scale, speed, and quality of agricultural land construction in China in 1966 were unprecedented in the 17 years since liberation. With the strong support of the Party and the state, the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in the north made particularly rapid progress in agricultural land construction over the past year. Some regions increased the area of irrigated land, terraced fields, ridged fields, and various types of terraced fields in the past year by more than the total area of the same type of farmland since liberation, and even more than the total area of the same type of farmland since liberation. From a national perspective, the area of irrigated land guaranteed and the area of various low-yielding fields transformed in the past year were also much greater than in any previous year.

In the winter of 1965, under the impetus of the socialist education movement in the countryside, the hundreds of millions of peasants in the north and south of China, following the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to seize the revolution and promote production, seriously summed up the experience of agricultural land construction in the past. Through this summary, people deeply realized that to develop socialist large-scale agriculture, it is necessary to continuously change the appearance of farmland, which means continuously carrying out agricultural land construction. Therefore, the masses in various places were full of revolutionary spirit to change heaven and earth, and enthusiastically launched agricultural land construction. Most of the regions in the North China Plain, starting from the need to prevent drought and combat drought, vigorously dug wells and springs, intercepted and diverted water, leveled land, and actively built terraced fields, ridged fields, and square fields that are effective in drainage, irrigation, and improving saline-alkali soil. The Loess Plateau in the northwest took water and soil conservation as the core of agricultural land construction. In the south, some regions that often suffer from floods and typhoons mainly continued to build flood control and wind resistance facilities; some drought-prone regions focused on building water storage, water diversion, and water lifting projects, combined with garden land construction.

The rapid development of agricultural land construction has brought about tremendous changes in the appearance of farmland in China. More and more areas that were previously prone to waterlogging have achieved drainage when waterlogged; more and more areas that were previously prone to drought have achieved irrigation when drought strikes; barren land has turned into fertile land, wasteland has turned into fertile fields, slopes have turned into terraced fields, and dry land has turned into paddy fields, and similar major changes have emerged in large numbers in the north and south. In some regions, with the continuous change in the appearance of farmland, the traces of the old small peasant economy have been completely eliminated. In 1966, although many regions in the country suffered severe droughts and some regions suffered floods, the country's grain, cotton, and various economic crops all achieved bumper harvests. The vigorous development of agricultural land construction was a very important factor.

The fundamental reason for the rapid, good, and economical development of agricultural land construction in China over the past year is that the broad masses of peasants in various places enthusiastically responded to Comrade Lin Biao's call, widely and deeply carried out the mass movement of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and used Mao Zedong Thought as the guide to carry out a thorough ideological revolution. They took the agricultural land construction site as a school, studied the "Old Three Articles" diligently, and learned and applied Chairman Mao's relevant works with their thoughts and work problems. The experience of various places has repeatedly proven that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will become a material force to change heaven and earth. The broad masses of peasants in Cangzhou District, Hebei Province, through learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, launched a large-scale agricultural land construction movement, and increased the area of irrigated land in the district from 1.2 million mu last year to 3 million mu this year. The peasants in Qingjian County, Shaanxi Province, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions on "Water conservancy is the lifeblood of agriculture" and the commentary Chairman Mao wrote for the article "Every person should have one mu of irrigated land," and launched an unprecedented large-scale agricultural land construction movement. In the past year, the area of new irrigated land increased by more than 17,000 mu, more than 20 times the original area of irrigated land before liberation. After studying Chairman Mao's works, the peasants in Yuxi County, Yunnan Province, changed their previous attitude of fearing difficulties, followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and launched the construction of water conservancy and the transformation of slopes into terraced fields. After one year of effort, the irrigated area increased by more than onefold compared to last year, and the area of slopes transformed into terraced fields increased by more than twentyfold compared to last year.

In carrying out agricultural land construction, many regions also followed Chairman Mao's instructions to, on the basis of seriously summing up experience, conduct comprehensive planning for construction projects. Various places, based on the principle of self-reliance and thrift in all undertakings, followed the plan to, in addition to building new projects, also reasonably adjusted and expanded the existing facilities, thus saving investment and further exploiting the potential of these projects, significantly improving their benefits.

At present, under the impetus and encouragement of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of peasants in various places have high revolutionary enthusiasm. They, through a re-summary of the practical experience of the past year, further realized that accelerating the construction of socialist large-scale farmland has a great effect on the development of agricultural production. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seize the revolution, promote production, take the agricultural land construction site as a large classroom for learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, continuously use Mao Zedong Thought to transform the subjective and objective worlds, further change the appearance of farmland, and strive for the rapid development of socialist large-scale agriculture.

    活学活用毛主席著作　发扬改天换地革命精神
    全国农田基本建设获巨大新成就
    在文化大革命推动下，亿万农民抓革命促生产进一步改变农田面貌
    据新华社六日讯　一九六六年，我国亿万农民群众在农村社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，高度发扬改天换地的革命精神，在农田基本建设战线上又取得巨大的新成就，有力地促进了各地农业的全面发展。
    一九六六年我国农田基本建设的规模之大、速度之快和质量之好，都是解放十七年来所仅见的。北方的各省、市、自治区，在党和国家的大力支持下，一年来农田基本建设发展尤为迅速。有一部分地区一年来新增的水浇地、台田、条田和各式梯田，比解放前保有的同类农田还多，也超过解放以来新增同类农田的总和。从全国来看，一年来新增加的保证灌溉面积和改造各种低产田的面积，也比以往任何一年都多得多。
    在一九六五年冬季，我国南北各地的亿万农民群众，在农村社会主义教育运动的推动下，按照毛主席和党中央抓革命、促生产的教导，认真地总结了过去进行农田基本建设的经验。通过总结，人们深刻地认识到，要发展社会主义的大农业，必须不断地改变农田面貌，这就要不断地进行农田基本建设。于是，各地群众大振改天换地的革命精神，意气风发地大兴农田基本建设。华北平原的大部分地区，从防旱抗旱的需要出发，大力打井掏泉，截流引水，平整土地，积极兴建对排涝抗旱和改造盐碱都有作用的台田、条田和方田。西北黄土高原则把水土保持作为农田基本建设的中心内容。在南方，一部分常遭水灾、台风侵袭的地区，主要是继续修建了防涝、防风设施；一部分易旱的地区，则以修建蓄水、引水、提水工程为主，结合进行园田建设。
    农田基本建设的迅速发展，使我国广大农田的面貌发生了巨大的变化。越来越多的历来易涝的地区，做到了遇涝能排；越来越多的历来易旱的地区，做到了遇旱能灌；瘠地变沃土，荒洲变良田，坡地改梯田，旱地改水田，以及诸如此类的重大变化，都已在南北各地大量地涌现出来。有些地区，随着农田面貌的不断变化，旧的小农经济的痕迹已经彻底消灭。一九六六年，全国有不少地区发生严重干旱，还有一部分地区发生水灾，全国粮食、棉花和各种经济作物却全面丰收，农田基本建设的蓬勃发展是个极为重要的因素。
    我国农田基本建设一年来多快好省地向前发展的根本原因，是各地广大农民群众热烈响应林彪同志的号召，广泛、深入地开展了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，以毛泽东思想为指针，大搞思想革命化的结果。他们以农田基本建设工地为学校，狠学“老三篇”，并且带着思想和工作中的问题，活学活用毛主席的有关著作。各地经验一再证明，毛泽东思想一旦被群众掌握，就会成为改天换地的物质力量。河北省沧州专区的广大农民群众通过活学活用毛主席著作，发扬了自力更生的革命精神，掀起了声势浩大的农田基本建设的高潮，一年来全区水浇地面积已由上年的一百二十万亩，发展到了三百万亩。陕西省清涧县的农民群众，反复学习了毛主席关于“水利是农业的命脉”的指示，和毛主席为《应当使每人有一亩水地》一文写的按语后，掀起了规模空前的农田基本建设运动，一年来新增水地面积一万七千多亩，比解放前原有水地面积扩大了二十多倍。云南省玉溪县的农民群众学习了毛主席著作后，一改过去的畏难情绪，按照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，奋起兴修水利和改坡地为梯田，经过一年努力，使灌溉面积比上年增加一倍多，坡地改梯田的面积更比上年扩大了二十倍。
    许多地区在进行农田基本建设时，还按照毛主席的教导，在认真总结经验的基础上，对建设工程进行了全面规划。各地本着自力更生，勤俭办一切事业的原则，按照规划，除建设新工程外，还对原有设施进行了合理的调整和扩充，从而节约了投资，使这些工程的潜力进一步得到发挥，效益显著提高。
    当前，在无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势的推动和鼓舞下，各地广大农民群众的革命热情很高，他们通过对一年来实践经验的再总结，进一步认识到加速社会主义大农田的建设，对农业生产的发展具有极大的作用。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促生产，把农田基本建设工地当成活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂，不断地用毛泽东思想改造主观世界和客观世界，更进一步地改变农田面貌，为加速社会主义大农业的发展而努力奋斗。
