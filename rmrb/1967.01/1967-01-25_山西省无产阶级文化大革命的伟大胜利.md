The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanxi Province

	“Tigers crouch and dragons coil, today surpassing yesterday, the earth and heavens overturned, stirring and impassioned.”
	Another thunderclap from the plain, under the warm care and support of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary organizations and representatives of the proletariat in Shanxi Province have united to seize back the various powers usurped by a small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the provincial party committee! The proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people have once again taken control and become masters of Shanxi Province!

	This is a great victory in the struggle to seize power from a small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road within a province, following the victory of the revolutionary rebel factions of the proletariat in Shanghai. It is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. It is a new great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Where there is oppression, there is resistance; where oppression is heaviest, resistance is most fierce. A small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, and the stubborn elements who insist on carrying out the reactionary bourgeois line, have long colluded with each other, formed cliques, and engaged in factionalism, attempting to turn Shanxi into their independent kingdom for restoring capitalism. In this great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have become even more brazen, stubbornly pushing the reactionary bourgeois line. They have one face in public and another in private, singing “self-criticism, self-criticism,” “confession, confession” on the surface, while secretly spreading poisonous winds and shooting dark arrows, scheming to suppress the revolutionary factions. Recently, when they were surrounded by layers of revolutionary masses and faced imminent doom, they became desperate and resorted to even more sinister and cunning methods—the counter-revolutionary economism, attempting to save themselves from complete annihilation.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “The reactionaries in various countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various oppressions they inflict on the revolutionary people ultimately only promote broader and more intense revolutions among the people.” The small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee are just such fools. Their frenzied attacks and counterattacks against the revolutionary factions are precisely digging their own graves. The revolutionary rebel factions of the proletariat in Shanxi have risen up to rebel against them, dismissed their officials, and seized their power. This is excellent! Excellent! It is truly excellent!!!

	The revolutionary rebel factions of the proletariat in Shanxi, in their struggle against a small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the party, are good at class analysis and good at grasping Chairman Mao’s strategic thinking, constantly discovering and expanding the leftist forces. They have not only united the proletarian revolutionary rebel factions among workers, peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary intellectuals but also united the leading cadres within the leadership organs who stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, forming an even broader army for the proletarian cultural revolution.

	The revolutionary leading cadres within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee, at the critical moment when the proletarian revolutionary line and the reactionary bourgeois line are engaged in a life-and-death struggle, stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, stand on the side of the revolutionary rebel factions, and unite with revolutionary workers, peasants, and revolutionary students, combining efforts from above and below and attacking from within and without, launching a comprehensive offensive against a small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the party.

	The People’s Liberation Army units of the Shanxi Military Region have firmly stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, firmly supporting and assisting the proletarian revolutionary factions, and at the crucial moment of the power seizure struggle, unhesitatingly and wholeheartedly supporting the proletarian revolutionary rebel factions to seize power, making a great contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The revolutionary rebel factions in Shanxi Province have created new experiences for the power seizure struggle of the proletarian revolutionary rebel factions across the country. The revolutionary leading cadres within the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee have set a good example for revolutionary leading cadres across the country. The People’s Liberation Army units of the Shanxi Military Region have set a bright banner for the officers and soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army across the country.

	The general direction of the power seizure struggle by the revolutionary rebel factions in Shanxi Province is completely correct. All proletarian revolutionary organizations and revolutionary comrades should enthusiastically support their power seizure struggle, vigorously publicize their power seizure struggle, actively participate in their power seizure struggle, and seriously learn from their power seizure experiences. This is the correct attitude of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. In the face of such major issues of right and wrong, it is wrong to stand behind and point fingers, and it is also wrong to stand aside and watch coldly.

	Revolutionary rebels, revolutionary comrades, revolutionary cadres, and officers and soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army, unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

	Learn from the revolutionary rebel spirit of the revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, and officers and soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army in Shanghai and Shanxi Province, and launch a comprehensive power seizure struggle against a small handful of those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the party!

	If the enemy does not surrender, let it perish completely!

### 山西省无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利

    山西省无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利
    “虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。”
    平地又是一声春雷，在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和支持下，山西省无产阶级的革命组织和代表们，联合起来，把省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派窃取的种种大权夺回来了！无产阶级和广大劳动人民，在山西省重新掌了大印，当家做主了！
    这是继上海市无产阶级革命造反派夺权斗争胜利以后，在一个省的范围内向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权斗争的伟大胜利，这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利！
    哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗；哪里压迫最重，哪里就反抗最烈。山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持执行资产阶级反动路线的顽固分子，长期以来，上下勾结，结党营私，企图把山西变成他们复辟资本主义的独立王国。在这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们更是变本加厉，顽固推行资产阶级反动路线。他们阴一面，阳一面，表面上高唱“检讨检讨”、“认罪认罪”，暗地里却刮阴风，放暗箭，处心积虑围剿革命派。最近，当他们陷入广大革命群众的层层包围之中，面临灭顶之灾的时候，就狗急跳墙，使出了更加阴险狡猾的手段——反革命经济主义，企图以此挽救他们彻底灭亡的命运。
    毛主席教导我们说：“各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”山西省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派也就是这样一些蠢人，他们对革命派的疯狂围攻和反扑，正是掘下了埋葬自己的坟墓。山西无产阶级革命造反派起来造他们的反了，罢了他们的官，夺了他们的权，这真是好得很！好得很！就是好得很！！！
    山西无产阶级革命造反派，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，善于作阶级分析，善于掌握毛主席的策略思想，不断发现和壮大左派队伍。他们不但把工人、农民、革命学生、革命军人、革命知识分子中的无产阶级革命造反派联合起来，而且把领导机关中那些站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边的领导干部也联合起来，组成了更加广泛的无产阶级文化革命大军。
    山西省委内革命的领导干部，在无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线生死决斗的紧要关头，站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，站在革命造反派一边，同革命的工人、农民和革命的学生团结一致，上下结合、内外夹攻，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开全面的总攻击。
    山西省军区的人民解放军部队，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决支持和援助了无产阶级革命派，在夺权斗争的关键时刻，毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持无产阶级革命造反派起来夺权，为无产阶级文化大革命做出了巨大的贡献。
    山西省的革命造反派，为全国无产阶级革命造反派的夺权斗争创造了新的经验。山西省委内革命的领导干部，为全国革命的领导干部作出了良好的榜样。山西省军区的人民解放军部队，为全国人民解放军指战员树立了鲜红的旗帜。
    山西省革命造反派夺权斗争的大方向，是完全正确的。一切无产阶级的革命组织，一切革命的同志，都应该热情支持他们的夺权斗争，大力宣传他们的夺权斗争，积极参加他们的夺权斗争，认真学习他们的夺权斗争经验。这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的正确的态度。在这样的大是大非问题面前，站在后面指手划脚是错误的，站在旁边冷眼观望也是错误的。
    革命的造反者们，革命的同志们，革命的干部们，人民解放军指战员们，在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下联合起来！
    学习上海市和山西省革命群众、革命干部和人民解放军指战员的革命造反精神，向一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派展开全面的夺权斗争！
    敌人不投降，就叫它彻底灭亡！
