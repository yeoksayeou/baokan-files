Albanian leaders and cadres, following the teachings of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the directives of the Party Central Committee on cadres participating in physical labor, actively and enthusiastically went to factories, mines, state farms, and agricultural cooperatives to work alongside the broad masses of workers and peasants in 1966.

Various levels of cadres, by seriously implementing the system of cadres participating in labor, have achieved great successes in strengthening ties with the masses and promoting the ideological revolutionization of cadres.

Cadres from various central departments such as the Ministry of Industry and Mining, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Agriculture, led by their respective department heads, formed labor teams and went to factories and villages to participate in labor. Kadri Hazbiu, a candidate member of the Political Bureau of the Party of Labor of Albania and the Minister of Interior, participated in livestock farming. He led a team that, together with the members of the agricultural cooperative, braved the cold wind and rain, walked tens of kilometers, and drove two summer pastures' livestock to the warmer winter pastures.

Cadres from the municipal and district committees and executive committees of Tirana and Durrës also went to factories or villages to participate in labor. Adil Çarçani, a candidate member of the Political Bureau of the Party of Labor of Albania and the Chairman of the Executive Committee of Tirana, participated in the labor of a factory in the city. Central Committee member, Durrës District Committee Secretary Dali Mamiqi went to the agricultural cooperative to participate in labor.

News workers from the capital's newspapers, led by Party Central Committee member, editor-in-chief of "Zëri i Popullit" (Voice of the People) Todi Lubonja, and editor-in-chief of "Bashkimi" (Unity) Fiqret Vogli, formed eight teams and went to eight districts including Tepelena and Elbasan to participate in agricultural production labor. They developed and trained a group of rural correspondents while working with the members, understood the farmers' opinions and demands for the newspaper, and solved the problem of delayed rural newspaper delivery.

In addition to actively working with workers and peasants, cadres at various levels also used their rest time to help the units where they worked to carry out political and cultural work, strengthen the grassroots party organizations, organize reading groups, and establish amateur art troupes, etc.

Grassroots cadres in various factories and agricultural cooperatives also enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and actively participated in physical labor.

Many Albanian cadres summarized their gains from participating in labor, saying that we learned many precious things from working with workers and peasants, which is very beneficial for our ideological tempering and revolutionization.

The broad masses of workers and peasants warmly welcomed the cadres working with them. Many workers and members said, "Cadres working with us on the land and in the workshops, sweating with us, show that they are not leading us with words but with actions. We trust them even more. They are indeed good cadres educated by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labor."

The heroic Albanian people, to implement the directives of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, started the new year by actively launching a new production upsurge.

In the first few days of the new year, the industrial front reported many victories, and many factories and mines achieved excellent production results. The workers of the "Victory" chromite mine exceeded the plan by 100 tons of chromite ore on the first day of the new year. The workers of the nickel-iron mine produced 384 tons more nickel-iron ore than the original plan in the two days of New Year's Day and the second.

After the new year, the broad masses of workers across the country launched the "Three Actions" mass movement. The "Three Actions" are: further promoting the creative spirit of the masses to promote the revolutionization of production; treating agriculture as a matter for the entire nation, strongly supporting agricultural production, and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance; raising the banner of quality, and building new factories through self-reliance.

In the agricultural front, the broad masses of peasants enthusiastically launched a production upsurge of winter land reclamation, terrace construction, fertilizer accumulation, water conservancy, and deep plowing of land. They want to greatly develop grain production and strongly develop the mountain economy. The Librazhd district has already reclaimed over 300 hectares of wasteland. The peasants of Korçë district have already deep-plowed 8,700 hectares of land and accumulated 96,000 tons of fertilizer.

A large number of young people enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party Central Committee to march towards the mountains and hills. Currently, more than 13,000 young people across the country are participating in land reclamation in various mountainous areas.

    全国一万三千多青年响应党中央号召上山开荒
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚党和国家机关广大干部按照恩维尔·霍查同志的教导和劳动党中央关于干部参加体力劳动的规定，在一九六六年积极踊跃地到工厂、矿山、国营农场和农业社同广大工农一起参加体力劳动。
    各级干部由于认真执行了干部参加劳动的制度，在密切同群众的联系，促进干部思想革命化方面取得巨大成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚工业和矿产部、内务部和农业部等中央各部门的干部，在各部门负责人的率领下，组成劳动小组分赴工厂、农村参加劳动。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局候补委员、内务部长卡·哈兹比乌参加了畜牧劳动。他率领的一个小组曾同农业社社员一起，迎着寒风和暴雨，步行几十公里，把两个夏季牧场的牲畜，赶往气候温暖的冬季牧场。
    地拉那市和都拉斯市的市、区委和执委会的干部也都到工厂或农村参加了劳动。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局候补委员、地拉那市执委会主席阿·凯莱齐参加了本市的一家工厂的劳动。中央委员、都拉斯区委书记达·马马基到农业社参加了劳动。
    阿尔巴尼亚首都报纸的新闻工作者，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、《人民之声报》总编托·卢鲍尼亚、《团结报》总编菲·沃格利等人的率领下，组成八个小组，分赴台佩莱纳和爱尔巴桑等八个区的农业社参加了农业生产劳动。他们在同社员一起劳动中发展和培养了一批农村通讯员，了解了农民对报纸的意见和要求，解决了这些农村收报迟缓的问题。
    各级机关干部除同工人、农民一起积极劳动外，还利用休息时间，帮助他们在那里劳动的单位进行政治、文化工作，帮助加强基层党组织开展农业社里的民主生活，组织读报组、建立业余文艺队伍等。
    各工厂企业和农业社的基层干部，也热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央的号召积极参加体力劳动。
    阿尔巴尼亚许多干部在总结自己参加劳动的收获时说，我们在同工人、农民一起劳动中，从他们那里学习到许多宝贵的东西，对自己的思想锻炼和思想革命化有极大好处。
    广大工农群众热烈欢迎干部同他们一起参加劳动。许多工人、社员说，干部同我们一块在土地上、在车间里流汗水，说明他们不是用语言，而是用行动来领导我们，我们就更加信任他们了。他们不愧是恩维尔·霍查同志和劳动党教导出来的好干部。
    据新华社地拉那十一日电　英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，为贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的指示，在新的一年一开始就积极掀起生产新高潮。
    新年头几天，工业战线上就捷报频传，许多工矿企业纷纷取得优秀的生产成绩。“胜利”铬矿的职工在新年的第一天就超计划地多开采了一百吨铬矿石。镍铁矿的职工在元旦和二日的两天内比原订计划增产了三百八十四吨镍铁矿石。
    全阿广大职工新年一过，就广泛展开了“三行动”的群众运动。“三行动”是：进一步发扬群众的创造精神，促进生产革命化；把农业看作全国人民的事情，大力支援农业生产，加强工农联盟；高举质量旗帜，自力更生地建设新的工厂。
    在农业战线上，广大农民热情地掀起冬季开荒、修梯田、积肥、兴修水利和深翻土地的生产热潮，他们要大搞粮食生产，大力发展山区经济。利布拉希区到目前止已经开出荒地三百多公顷。科尔察区农民已经深翻土地八千七百多公顷，积肥九万六千吨。
    大批青年热烈响应阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央提出的向荒山和丘陵进军的号召，目前，在全国各个山区参加开荒的青年已达一万三千多人。
