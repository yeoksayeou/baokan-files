Shanghai and East China revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses have been sending letters and telegrams in recent days, warmly congratulating the birth of the new *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily*. They enthusiastically pointed out that the emergence of the new, revolutionary *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* is a victory of the proletarian revolutionary line over the bourgeois reactionary line. It is a major event in the history of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great revolution. The birth of the *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* greatly boosts the morale of the proletariat and greatly dampens the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. This major event will undoubtedly play a huge role in promoting the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire East China region and in various provinces and cities across the country.

The revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses in Shanghai and East China believe that the Revolutionary Rebel Joint Command of the *Liberation Daily* has seized control of the newspaper, putting it in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries, completely transforming its appearance and filling it with revolutionary and combative voices. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. This revolutionary action signifies that the revolutionary leftists in various levels of party and government organs in Shanghai have broken through the frameworks set by the implementers of the bourgeois reactionary line, such as "distinguishing between internal and external affairs." They have come out to fight, uniting with the workers, peasants, and revolutionary students, to launch a total attack on the bourgeois reactionary line and to wage a more resolute struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

The young revolutionaries from the Shanghai Red Guards Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters, the Red Revolutionary Society of the Second Medical College of Shanghai, and other units said: Mao Zedong Thought is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Whatever does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought, we will rebel against it and overthrow it. Since the start of the Cultural Revolution, the *Liberation Daily* has faithfully executed a bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing the revolution and attacking the leftists, committing heinous crimes. Such a newspaper must be seized! We must cut off the throats of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn defenders of the bourgeois reactionary line, silencing their poisonous tongues! The party's newspaper, the people's newspaper, can only be a bastion for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, only for loudly advocating Mao Zedong's revolutionary line, and for promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Let the great, invincible, and brilliant Mao Zedong Thought color all of Shanghai, all of China, and the entire world red.

Yesterday, the revolutionary rebels and revolutionary masses in the Shanghai region heard the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the *People's Daily*'s reprint of the "Open Letter to the People of Shanghai" and the editorial note, and they were even more elated and excited. Many warriors from the Red Revolutionary Society of the First Medical College of Shanghai, the Zunyi Brigade, listened to the broadcast and wrote one red banner after another, printed one celebratory leaflet after another, expressing their most enthusiastic and resolute support for the "Open Letter to the People of Shanghai" and their most enthusiastic welcome for the publication of the *People's Daily*'s editorial note. They carried these red banners and marched through the streets to propagate. The warriors from the Red Revolutionary Society of Fudan University, the "Never Surrender" Brigade of Shanghai Jiaotong University, and the "Red Guards United Combat Team" of the East Is Red Film Studio listened to the broadcast of the *People's Daily*'s editorial note with extremely excited hearts. They were overjoyed and ecstatic, shouting enthusiastically: Long live our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! They said: The editorial note of the *People's Daily* is the voice of Chairman Mao. Every time the revolution faces a critical moment, every time the revolutionary rebels face arduous struggles, Chairman Mao points out the direction for us, gives us courage, gives us strength, encourages us to charge forward, overcome all difficulties, and achieve victory. With Chairman Mao leading us and supporting us, we will definitely be able to defeat all enemies and achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary rebel armies and revolutionary masses in Shanghai resolutely declared that they would, together with the revolutionary workers of the *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily*, with the most steadfast revolutionary will and the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, turn the *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily* into revolutionary rebel newspapers, making them truly tools of proletarian dictatorship and great schools for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. A month ago, to thoroughly expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party, the young warriors of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Mechanical Engineering Institute who had fought in the *Liberation Daily* heard the news that the *Liberation Daily* had been seized back by the proletariat. They shouted over and over again: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" They said: During our eight days and nine nights of struggle in the *Liberation Daily*, we thought in our hearts: When will this tool that faithfully executes the bourgeois reactionary line return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line? Less than a month later, our wish has come true! The new *Liberation Daily* will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, hold high the banner of revolutionary rebellion, and hold high the banner of criticism, making great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to the dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought. Workers from State-owned Factory 614, revolutionary youths from the Nangeng Production Team of Yuangang Commune in Chuansha County, and six comrades including Deng Baojun from a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison Area wrote in a letter: Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for running the *Liberation Daily* well. We are determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn in struggle, and use in struggle, taking the "Three Articles" as our motto, breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public"; uniting with the revolutionary workers of the *Liberation Daily*, fighting together, making the newspaper sharp and bold, with clear banners, becoming a great school for the masses to learn Mao Zedong Thought, and a powerful tool for defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and exposing and criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line.

Many revolutionary rebel newspapers in the East China region also sent telegrams and letters of congratulations, warmly hailing the birth of the *Wenhui Daily* and *Liberation Daily*, and hailing the new victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

    上海和华东地区广大革命造反派热烈祝贺《文汇报》《解放日报》新生
    把报纸办得旗帜鲜明成为革命造反派的报纸
    新华社上海十日电　上海和华东地区广大革命造反派和革命群众，连日来纷纷写信打电报，热烈祝贺《文汇报》和《解放日报》的新生。他们热情洋溢地指出，崭新面貌的、革命的《文汇报》和《解放日报》的出现，是无产阶级革命路线反对资产阶级反动路线的胜利产物，是我国无产阶级文化大革命发展史上的一件大事，是一个大革命。《文汇报》和《解放日报》的新生，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。这件大事必将对于整个华东、对于全国各省市的无产阶级文化大革命运动的发展，起着巨大的推动作用。
    上海和华东地区的革命造反派和革命群众认为，《解放日报》革命造反联合司令部夺取了报纸的领导权，把报纸掌握在无产阶级革命派的手里，使报纸的面貌焕然一新，充满了革命的战斗的声音。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这一革命行动，标志着上海市各级党政机关的革命左派打破了资产阶级反动路线的推行者所设置的“内外有别”等框框，他们杀了出来，同工农群众、革命学生一起，实行大团结大联合，向资产阶级反动路线发动总攻击，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行更坚决的斗争。
    上海市红卫兵革命造反总司令部、红革会上海第二医学院井冈山支队等单位的革命小将说：毛泽东思想是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。凡是不符合毛泽东思想的言行，我们就要造它的反，就要革它的命。文化大革命以来，《解放日报》忠实地执行了一条资产阶级反动路线，镇压革命，打击左派，犯下了滔天罪行。这样的报纸，一定要夺过来！我们就是要卡住一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派和坚持资产阶级反动路线的顽固派放毒的喉咙，割断他们放毒的舌头！党的报纸，人民的报纸，只能是宣传毛泽东思想的阵地，只能为毛主席的革命路线大喊大叫，为无产阶级文化大革命推波助澜，让伟大的、战无不胜的、光芒万丈的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想染红整个上海，整个中国，整个世界。
    昨天，上海地区广大革命造反派和革命群众听到中央人民广播电台广播了《人民日报》转载的《告上海全市人民书》和编者按后，更是欢欣鼓舞，无限激动。红革会上海第一医学院遵义兵团的许多战士，听完广播就激动地写了一幅又一幅的大红喜报，印了一张又一张的报喜传单，表示最热烈最坚决地拥护《告上海全市人民书》，最热烈地欢呼《人民日报》编者按的发表。他们抬着这些大红喜报，上街游行宣传。复旦大学红革会、上海交通大学反到底兵团、东方红电影制片厂东方红红卫兵联合战斗队的战士们，以极其兴奋的心情，收听了电台广播的《人民日报》编者按，他们兴高采烈，欢腾雀跃，尽情地高呼：我们心中最红最红的红太阳、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！他们说：《人民日报》的编者按，是毛主席的声音。每当革命斗争的关键时刻，每当革命造反派面临着艰巨斗争的时刻，毛主席就给我们指明航向，就给我们勇气，就给我们力量，鼓励我们去冲锋陷阵，去排除万难，夺取胜利。有毛主席给我们领航，有毛主席给我们撑腰，我们就一定能战胜一切敌人，取得文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    上海各路革命造反大军和革命群众，坚决表示要和《文汇报》社、《解放日报》社的革命职工一起，以最坚定的革命意志，最大的革命热情，把《文汇报》、《解放日报》办成一张革命造反的报纸，使《文汇报》《解放日报》真正成为无产阶级专政的工具，成为宣传毛泽东思想的大学校。一个月前，为了彻底揭发批判中共上海市委的资产阶级反动路线，曾经在《解放日报》社进行斗争的红卫兵上海机械学院革命委员会的小将们，听到《解放日报》已夺回到无产阶级手中的消息后，一遍又一遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”他们说：我们在《解放日报》社八天九夜的斗争中，我们心里在想：什么时候《解放日报》这个忠实执行资产阶级反动路线的工具，才能重新回到毛主席的革命路线上来啊！时间还不到一个月，我们的愿望实现了！新生的《解放日报》一定会高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高高举起革命造反的大旗，高高举起批判的大旗，为无产阶级文化大革命作出巨大的贡献，为传播毛泽东思想作出巨大的贡献。国营六一四厂工人、川沙县洋泾公社民生生产队革命青年和上海警备区某部邓宝泉等六同志来信说：毛泽东思想是办好《解放日报》的根本保证。我们决心更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学，大破“私”字，大立“公”字；和《解放日报》社的革命职工团结在一起，战斗在一起，把报纸办得尖锐泼辣，旗帜鲜明，成为群众学习毛泽东思想的大学校，成为捍卫毛主席的革命路线，揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的强有力的工具。
    华东地区许多报社的革命造反派，也纷纷发来贺电和贺信，热烈欢呼《文汇报》和《解放日报》的新生，欢呼毛泽东思想的新胜利。
