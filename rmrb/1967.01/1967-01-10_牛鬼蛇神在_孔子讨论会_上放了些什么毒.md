At the "Confucius Discussion Meeting" organized by Zhou Yang, the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" and the counter-revolutionary elements Li Jingchun, Feng Youlan, Lü Zhenghao, Jin Jingfang, Gao Zanyi, Liu Jie, and Jin Zhaoqi, went mad with arrogance, spreading a large amount of poisonous weeds. They launched vicious attacks on the Party, on socialism, and on Mao Zedong Thought.

To help everyone recognize their counter-revolutionary, ugly faces, we are now excerpting a small part of their reactionary fallacies for public exposure.

1. They fervently praised and glorified Confucius, and viciously slandered and attacked Mao Zedong Thought.

	“The term ‘great’ can be fully applied to Confucius.”
	“Confucius was a great philosopher, politician, and educator of ancient times, and there is no exaggeration in this. Moreover, some of Confucius' theories still shine brightly today, which is not accidental.”
	“Confucius is indeed a sage and a paragon of virtue, and the happiness of mankind is related to his words.”
	“Why is it that only China is so great? How was it formed?... I think Confucius played a definite positive role in this matter. Imagine, for two thousand years, over tens of thousands of miles, people have basically taken the books compiled and edited by Confucius as classics. Is this a small matter? In fact, people have had a unified center, and from then on, everyone has had a common language, common thoughts, common emotions, and common living habits. How significant is this for the formation and unity of the Chinese nation?”
	“Confucius has become the representative of Chinese national culture and the core of unified Chinese thought. The title of ‘First Sage and Teacher’ has long existed not only in the ancestral tablets but also in the hearts and mouths of the people.”
	Note: They praised and glorified Confucius to an extremely fanatical degree. Their intention is clear: to establish the absolute authority of Confucius and attempt to use Confucius' thoughts to unify the thoughts, language, emotions, and habits of 700 million people. They want to do everything possible to defame and attack Mao Zedong Thought. They want to stage a counter-revolutionary restoration. This is absolutely impossible. We must thoroughly overthrow Confucius' thoughts and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought!

2. They vigorously promoted Confucius' "benevolent rule" and "moral governance," viciously attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat, and openly incited counter-revolutionary restoration.

	“What is the highest standard of politics? It is to practice ‘benevolent rule,’ to ‘guide with virtue’ and ‘harmonize with rites,’ making the people ‘feel shame and correct themselves.’”
	“What is ‘self-restraint’?... To restore rituals, one must treat others equally, respect others, and not merely oppress or destroy others, and not engage in cannibalistic actions.”
	“... The meaning of the word ‘benevolence’ is not just ‘love for others,’ but to improve relationships between people.... Always think of others. Isn't this ‘do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire’? Isn't this ‘wish to establish others, wish to reach others’? If everyone can do this, the relationships between people will naturally be without grievances.”
	“‘Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire,’ ‘wish to establish others, wish to reach others’; the ‘people’ mentioned here... means ‘others’ or ‘others.’ For example, we say: ‘The Soviet Union has already built communism.’ The negative aspect of the ‘doctrine of loyalty and reciprocity’ is: do not treat others in a way you do not wish to be treated. The positive aspect of the ‘doctrine of loyalty and reciprocity’ is: treat others in a way you wish to be treated.”
	“As the wheel of history rolls forward, the number of coexisting states, that is, the number of opposing sides, decreases, which should be a progressive phenomenon. On the contrary, the more coexisting states there are, the more opposing sides there are, the more wars there are, and the more chaotic the world is, which should be a regressive phenomenon.”

	Note: The dictatorship of the proletariat can only give democracy to the people and exercise dictatorship over the reactionaries. Therefore, they slander us as “not benevolent.” They want us to practice “benevolent rule” on the reactionaries, which means abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. If their plot succeeds, we will perish as a party and as a nation, the revolution will fail, and the people will suffer.

3. They used ancient events to criticize the present, attacking the Three Red Banners and insulting the Party's leadership.

	“Blindly rushing into things is completely driven by insatiable desires; from desire, things will go wrong.... Ignoring specific conditions and relying solely on subjectivism, one cannot do things well. If one insists on errors and allows personalism and greed to develop unchecked, one will sink deeper and deeper, leading to greater errors and suffering greater consequences.”
	“Being stubbornly self-confident, not accepting others' advice, knowing only straight-line development, not assessing one's strength, not considering the situation, not considering the conditions, this is like being too rigid and breaking, leading to the collapse of the house.”
	“To develop the ideological consciousness of society, one must first solve problems such as eating and clothing. The problem of eating and drinking in society is important and cannot be taken lightly.”
	“Those who boast about knowing half of the things in heaven and all the things on earth are not necessarily truly omniscient and omnipotent; on the contrary, their true insights may be very few.”
	“The affirmative aspect is destroyed, and there is achievement and destruction, which is the law of development of things. From frost to solid ice, this is such development. Because after the solid ice, when spring comes and flowers bloom, the spring light is bright, and the spring water is flowing, it is time for the solid ice to melt.”
	“If a minister serves during a time of debauchery and dies while advising the ruler with frank words, whether it is the ruling class of slave owners or the ruling class of feudal lords, they all think it is a good thing. As the saying goes, ‘A loyal minister is not afraid of death, but fearing death is not loyalty.’”

	Note: Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of our country have achieved brilliant victories in socialist revolution and construction under the guidance of the Three Red Banners; they, however, curse us for “blindly rushing into things” and “leading to the collapse of the house.” Chairman Mao teaches us: “Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.” The more they attack, the higher we must hold up the Three Red Banners.

4. They attempted to disguise Confucius' idealist worldview as a dialectical materialist worldview.

	“I think Confucius' worldview is not only materialist but also has a bit of a dialectical materialist flavor. This flavor is like a red thread running through Confucius' life-long speeches.”
	“Mencius said: ‘Confucius is a sage of his time.’... What is this viewpoint? I think it is not an idealist and metaphysical viewpoint, nor can it be said to be a third kind of viewpoint. The most appropriate name should be a materialist and dialectical viewpoint.”
	“The Confucian school does not lightly discuss some profound mysteries. Although these words are not said by Confucius, they do express the advantages of Confucianism and are not in great conflict with the dialectical materialism we discuss.”
	“In my opinion, (Confucius') ‘inquire deeply and think broadly’ is precisely the spirit of Marxism-Leninism.”
	“These thoughts of Confucius and Mencius have now been criticized and absorbed, and have been reconstructed as an important component of the cultivation of party spirit for communists and Communist Party members. Comrade Liu Shaoqi, in his outstanding theoretical work ‘On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members,’ has brilliantly completed this task.”

	Note: They actually claim that Confucius' idealist worldview is a dialectical materialist worldview. This is completely turning black into white and confusing right and wrong. They even want Communist Party members to take it as an important component of “party spirit cultivation.” This is a blatant opposition to the great Mao Zedong Thought.

5. They advocated for people to “love each other and embrace each other,” attempting to blur class boundaries and eliminate class struggle.

	“In fact, Confucius' ‘benevolence’... is directed at the whole people. And its essential characteristic is particularly in ‘loving the people.’”
	“‘Benevolence’ is to love people.”
	“‘Benevolence’ has the most ordinary meaning of ‘loving people,’ acknowledging the right to exist.”
	“‘Those who are benevolent, wish to establish others, wish to reach others...’ This means to be good for oneself and also for others.”
	“‘Benevolence’ is ‘mutual respect,’ people respect each other, you do not suspect me, I do not deceive you, interact with tolerance, love each other, and embrace each other.”
	“Confucius' ‘love for people,’ in subjective intention, is to love the ruling class, and in objective effect, also ‘loves’ the ‘small people.’”
	“‘Those who are benevolent love people,’ this is Confucius' highest generalization of ‘benevolence.’ To ‘love people,’ one must negatively achieve ‘do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire,’ and positively achieve ‘wish to establish others, wish to reach others.’”
	“We cannot say that our era and our society do not need ‘benevolence.’”
	“To entangle all historical facts of antiquity in class viewpoint is also not easy to understand.”
	“Some people insist on taking the two sentences ‘a gentleman learns the way and loves people, a petty person learns the way and is easy to control’ out of context and distorting them, saying that Confucius looks down on the working people, and have wantonly ruined a good piece of advice.”

	Note: The relationship between slave owners and slaves, landlords and peasants, capitalists and workers is one of exploitation and being exploited. Their struggle is a life-and-death struggle and is absolutely impossible to achieve “mutual love” and “embrace each other.” In a socialist society where classes and class struggle still exist, these ghosts and snakes openly advocate for people to “love each other and embrace each other.” Their fundamental purpose is to blur class boundaries and eliminate class struggle. Are they not singing the same tune as the Khrushchev revisionists?

### 牛鬼蛇神在“孔子讨论会”上放了些什么毒

    牛鬼蛇神在“孔子讨论会”上放了些什么毒
    在周扬策划下召开的“孔子讨论会”上，资产阶级反动学术“权威”和牛鬼蛇神李景春、冯友兰、吕振羽、金景芳、高赞非、刘节、金兆梓等人嚣张得发了狂，放出了大量的毒草，对党、对社会主义、对毛泽东思想进行了恶毒的攻击。
    为了让大家认清他们的反革命狰狞面目，现在把他们的反动谬论综合摘出一小部分来示众。
    一、狂热地歌颂、美化孔老二，恶毒地污蔑、攻击毛泽东思想。
    “‘伟大’二字，完全可以加到孔子身上。”
    “孔子是古代世界伟大的哲学家、政治家和教育家，绝无溢美，而孔子若干理论，在今日，犹射异彩，亦非偶然。”
    “孔子实为至圣至贤的哲学家，人类的幸福，关系于孔子的一言半语。”
    “为什么世界上独有中国这样大？它是怎样形成的？……我认为孔子在这个问题上是起了一定的积极作用的。试想，二千年之久，几万里之内，基本上人们长期都以孔子所编著的书籍为经典，这是小事情吗？事实上，人们已经有了统一的中心，从此，大家彼此间有了共同的语言，共同的思想，共同的感情，共同的生活习惯，这对于中国民族的形成和团结、统一的关系，该有多么重大呢？”
    “孔子成了中国民族文化的代表，成了统一中国民族思想的重心。‘至圣先师’的称号，不但长期存在于祀典的牌位上，也长期存在于人们的心中和口中。”
    按：他们歌颂孔老二，美化孔老二，简直达到了极其狂热的程度。他们的目的是一目了然的，就是要树立孔老二的绝对权威，妄图用孔老二的思想来统一七亿人民的思想、语言、情感和习惯。就是要千方百计地诋毁、攻击毛泽东思想。就是要搞反革命复辟。这一千个办不到，一万个办不到。我们一定要彻底打倒孔子思想，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威！
    二、大肆宣扬孔老二的“仁政”“德治”，恶毒攻击无产阶级专政，公开煽动反革命复辟。
    “政治的最高标准是什么呢？是行‘仁政’，是‘道之以德’，‘齐之以礼’，使民‘有耻且格’。”
      “克己是什么呢？……复礼，当然是要以‘平等’待人，要尊重别人，决不是一味的压迫别人，决不是摧残别人，决不是进行吃人的行动。”
    “……这‘仁’字的意义，决不单是‘爱人’，而是搞好人与人间的关系。……随时随事都会想到他人。这不即是‘己所不欲，勿施于人’吗？不即是‘己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人’吗？人人能如此，人与人间的关系自然无怨。”
    “‘己所不欲，勿施于人’，‘己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人’；这里所说的‘人’，……意思就是‘别箇’，或者是‘人家’。例如我们说：‘人家苏联，已经建设共产主义了’。‘忠恕之道’的消极方面就是说：你自己不愿人家怎样待你，你也不要那样待人家。……‘忠恕之道’的积极方面就是说：你愿意人家怎样待你，你也就那样待人家。”
      “历史车轮越往前进，并立的国家，即敌对的方面就越少，这应该是进步的现象。反之，并立的国家越多，也即敌对的方面越多，战争也越多，天下也越乱，这应该是退化的现象。”
    按：无产阶级专政只能是给人民以民主，对反动派实行专政。因此他们辱骂我们“不仁”，他们要我们对反动派实行“仁政”，就是取消无产阶级专政。如果他们的阴谋得逞，我们就要亡党亡国，革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃。
    三、借古讽今，指桑骂槐；恶毒地攻击三面红旗，辱骂党的领导。
   “盲目乱干，这完全是由于贪得无厌的欲望所驱使；从欲就会把事作坏。……不顾具体环境，单凭主观主义，是不能把事作好的，如果还要坚持错误，让个人主义的贪心不受约束地发展，那就愈陷愈深，招来更大的错误，尝到更大的恶果。”
      “偏执自信，不纳人言，只知直线的发展，不量力，不审势，不顾环境，不管条件，这样过刚必折，就造成栋挠，造成倾败其室的恶果。”
    “要发展社会的意识形态必须先解决吃饭、穿衣等等社会问题。社会上的吃饭问题，饮食问题，是有其重要性，决不可等闲视之的。”
    “自高自大的人自称天上的事知道一半，地下的事则全知，这样的人并不见得真正全知全能，恰恰相反，他的真知灼见可能很少。”
    “肯定的方面是毁灭的，有成就有毁，这是事物发展的规律。从霜到坚冰，正是这种发展。因为在坚冰以后，春暖花开，那时春光明媚，春水溶溶，就到了坚冰溶化的时候了。”
    “若大臣仕于淫乱之期，以直言谏君致死，无论当权的奴隶主阶级或当权的封建领主阶级都以为是好事，所谓‘忠臣不怕死，怕死岂为忠’是也。”
    按：我国人民在毛主席的英明领导下，在三面红旗指引下，在社会主义革命和建设中取得了辉煌的胜利；他们却骂我们是“盲目乱干”，“造成倾败其室的恶果”。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”他们越是攻击，我们越是要把三面红旗更高高地举起。
    四、妄图把孔老二的唯心主义的世界观打扮成辩证唯物主义的世界观。
    “我以为孔夫子的世界观还不但是唯物主义，似乎还有点辩证唯物主义的味儿。这味儿简直还好像一条红线似的贯串在孔夫子一生的言论中。”
    “孟子说：‘孔子圣之时者也’。……这是什么观点呢？我看它不是唯心的和形而上学的观点，也不能说是什么第三种观点，最恰当的称呼，应该是唯物的和辩证的观点。”
    “儒家对于某些高深的玄理，是不轻于谈论的，这话虽非孔子说，但自是说出孔学的优点，和我们所谈的辩证唯物主义是没有什么很大抵触的。”
    “据我看（孔子的）‘切问近思’正是马列主义的精神。”
    “孔孟这些思想，现在已被批判吸收，重新塑造为无产阶级、共产党人党性修养的重要组成部分之一。刘少奇同志在他的卓越理论著作《论共产党员的修养》里，非常杰出地完成了这一任务。”
    按：他们居然把孔老二的唯心主义世界观说成是辩证唯物主义的世界观。这完全是颠倒黑白、混淆是非。他们竟然还要共产党员将它作为“党性修养”的重要组成部分。这是明目张胆地反对伟大的毛泽东思想。
    五、鼓吹人与人“彼此相爱，互相拥抱”，妄图模糊阶级界限，抹煞阶级斗争。
    “事实上，孔子的‘仁’……是以全民为对象。而其本质特点，尤在于‘仁民’。”
    “‘仁’就是要人去‘爱人’。”
    “‘仁’的最普通的意义是‘爱人’，是承认人的生存权利。”
    “‘夫仁者，己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人……’这就是说要自己好，也要别人好。”
    “‘仁’是‘相人偶’，人与人彼此相安，尔不虞，我不诈，相交以恕，彼此相爱，互相拥抱。”
    “孔子的‘爱人’，在主观愿望上是爱统治阶级，在客观效果上，也‘爱’了‘小人’。”
    “‘仁者爱人’，这是孔子对‘仁’具有最高概括性的提法。为要‘爱人’，就必须消极的做到‘己所不欲，勿施于人’，积极的做到‘己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人’”。
    “不能说我们的时代和我们社会不需要‘仁’。”
    “把古代的历史事实样样都纠缠在阶级观点上去，也是不容易搞得通的。”
    “有些人偏要把‘君子学道则爱人，小人学道则易使’两句话抽出来，加以曲解，说孔子轻视劳动人民，把好好一段美好的意见白白糟踏掉了。”
    按：奴隶主和奴隶，地主和农民，资本家和工人，他们之间是剥削和被剥削的关系。他们之间的斗争是你死我活的斗争，绝不可能“彼此相爱”“互相拥抱”。在仍然存在阶级和阶级斗争的社会主义社会里，这些牛鬼蛇神公开宣扬人与人之间要“彼此相爱，互相拥抱”，其根本目的是妄图模糊阶级界限，取消阶级斗争。他们和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者唱的不正是同一个调子吗？
