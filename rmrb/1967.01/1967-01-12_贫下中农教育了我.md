I am a new soldier who has recently joined the army's cultural work. Last year, when I went to the countryside for tempering, in order to support the socialist education movement, the leadership assigned me to tell the villagers stories of the blood and tears of the poor and lower-middle peasants. At that time, I kept thinking: telling stories involves neither makeup nor stage performance, just wearing a work uniform and standing under an oil lamp, without even being able to present an image. What kind of art is this? I really wanted to decline this task. Just at this moment, I remembered Chairman Mao's words: "...they love the workers, peasants, and soldiers in some aspects, but sometimes they do not, in some places they do not, they do not love their feelings, their posture, their budding state of art (wall newspapers, murals, folk songs, folk stories, etc.)." Isn't this me? In some aspects, I love the poor and lower-middle peasants, but I do not love the art forms they like—storytelling, reciting stories. Why is this so? Just as Chairman Mao criticized, my soul is still a kingdom of petty-bourgeois intellectuals.

Chairman Mao's words hit the mark. I realized: whether or not to accept the task of storytelling is not just a matter of whether a revolutionary soldier executes orders, but a big issue of whether to listen to Chairman Mao's words and whether to be willing to reform bourgeois ideology. To wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, one must abandon individualism, love what the workers, peasants, and soldiers love, and accept the task of storytelling in thought.

The task of storytelling was accepted. But when I went on stage, I was like a primary school student reciting a text. When I talked about the old poor peasant being killed by the evil landlord, I was not sad; when I talked about the old poor peasant's family lacking food and starving, I was not heartbroken; when I talked about the old poor peasant's family being destroyed, I was not heartbroken. Especially when I came to the most crucial part: a poor peasant was beaten to death by the landlord, lying in a pool of blood, and the old woman saw it and cried out, "My husband... you died so miserably!" I wanted to be moved, but I pronounced "miserably" as "product," and my emotions were cut off, and I couldn't continue. The audience criticized: "It doesn't sound like telling a family history. Such a tragic thing, it seems like it has nothing to do with him!"

This time, I failed. I reread Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." When I read "Our intellectuals who engage in literary and artistic work must change their thoughts and emotions and undergo a transformation," my heart suddenly lit up like a lamp, "flash" and brightened. Why can't I hate what the workers and peasants hate? Because I don't have the feelings of the workers and peasants, but I have the petty-bourgeois mentality. Therefore, to tell the story well, I must thoroughly reform my emotions!

From then on, I decided to sincerely combine with the workers and peasants and learn from them. I often went to the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants to visit and inquire about their hardships. The person who educated me the most was an old peasant. He talked about fleeing during the old society. He said: "At that time, we had a rhyme: Wearing hemp cloth does not keep out the cold, burning a pile of firewood to save one's life, roasting the front and back, enduring winter after winter." After finishing, he unbuttoned his cotton-padded clothes and let me see. I saw that his chest and back were covered with black scars, the evidence of the old society was still vivid. All this gave me a deep education.

The poor and lower-middle peasants educated me, and my emotions began to change, and my heart began to stick with the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants. I concentrated the poor and lower-middle peasants' hatred for the old society and love for the new society into the story, feeling that the father and mother, sisters in the story were my own parents and sisters, and I was the little brother in the story. Every time I came to the tragic part, I couldn't help but cry out loud, and when I talked about standing up and being liberated, I couldn't help but laugh through my tears. The audience was very moved, and sometimes the whole scene was filled with sadness.

The story I told aroused a strong response among the masses. Many people said: "It's more bitter than 'White-Haired Girl.'" But some people said: "It's not bad, but it's just bitter." This opinion gave me a deep enlightenment. Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people." Telling stories should not only make people feel bitter but should also make people hate the enemy. Only by hating the enemy immensely can one produce tremendous material force to smash the entire old world! Why don't I hate the enemy enough? The fundamental problem is that the petty-bourgeois thoughts and emotions have not been completely transformed, and the "soft-boned" spirit of the petty bourgeoisie has replaced the "hard-boned" spirit of the proletariat.

To thoroughly reform petty-bourgeois emotions, one must continue to learn from the workers and peasants. Therefore, I especially paid attention to learning from those heroic figures. Wherever I went to a village, I would go among the poor and lower-middle peasants to listen to moving revolutionary stories. The story of Liu Chun's son, Liu Shixi, a martyr who sacrificed his life, moved me the most. The enemy tied him to the execution ground and ordered him to kneel down, but he raised his head and shouted loudly: "Communist Party members do not kneel down!" The enemy cut off his right leg, and he lay in a pool of blood, cursing: "Bandits, your days are numbered, the people will settle this score with you. You killed me, Liu Shixi, but you can't kill all the Communist Party members!" Finally, he sacrificed his life with the slogans "Long live the Communist Party!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" After hearing this story, I suddenly felt full of energy, understanding what kind of spirit a revolutionary should have, understanding how to portray the workers and peasants in the story, and understanding that I should use this "hard-boned" spirit to inspire the people, turn sorrow into strength, and carry the revolution to the end. From then on, when I told stories, I no longer felt that I was just a pitiful sufferer, but I felt that I was like Liu Shixi, a "hard-boned" person. The poor and lower-middle peasants also reflected: "After listening to the story, I feel full of energy!" My ideological transformation has just begun, and the story is not well told, but I have begun to understand: a literary and artistic worker who truly wants to serve the workers and peasants must first go deep into the workers and peasants, combine with the workers and peasants, and thoroughly reform his thoughts.

    贫下中农教育了我
    王学新
    我是参加部队文艺工作不久的新战士。去年到农村锻炼的时候，为了配合社会主义教育运动，领导上叫我给社员讲讲贫下中农血泪史的故事。当时，我心里老嘀咕：讲故事一不化妆，二不登台，穿着一身劳动服，站在油灯底下，连个形象都表演不出来，这算是什么艺术？一心想把这个任务推掉。就在这时候，我想起了毛主席的话：“……他们在某些方面也爱工农兵，也爱工农兵出身的干部，但有些时候不爱，有些地方不爱，不爱他们的感情，不爱他们的姿态，不爱他们的萌芽状态的文艺（墙报、壁画、民歌、民间故事等）。”我不就是这样吗？在某些方面也爱贫下中农，但是不爱他们所喜爱的文艺形式——说书、讲故事。为什么会这样呢？正像毛主席所批判的，自己的“灵魂深处还是一个小资产阶级知识分子的王国”。
    毛主席的话击中了我的要害。我认识到：接不接受讲故事的任务，不仅仅是个革命战士执行不执行命令的问题，而是听不听毛主席的话、愿不愿意改造资产阶级思想的大问题。要全心全意为工农兵服务，就必须丢掉个人主义，爱工农兵所爱，把讲故事的任务从思想上接受下来。
    讲故事的任务是接受了。可是我一上台就像小学生背书一样，讲到老贫农被恶霸地主杀死的时候我不难过，讲到老贫农全家缺粮断炊的时候我不心酸，讲到老贫农家破人亡的时候我也不伤心。特别讲到最关键一段：一位贫农被地主活活打死，躺在血泊里，大娘见了失声痛哭：“孩子他爹……你死的好惨啊！”我本想激动一下，谁知把“惨”字说成了“产”，情绪一断就说不下去了。群众批评说：哪里像讲家史，这么悲惨的事，好像与他毫无关系似的！
    这一次就这样失败了。我重读了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。当我读到“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造”时，我的心里像突然打开了一盏明灯，“唰”地一下亮了。为什么我不能恨工农兵所恨？因为我没有工农兵的感情，有的还是小资产阶级那一套。因此，要想把故事讲好，就必须把自己的感情来一番彻底的改造！
    从这以后，我下决心要踏踏实实地与工农兵相结合，向他们学习。我经常到贫下中农家里去访贫问苦。给我教育最深的是一位贫农老大爷的谈话。他讲起了在旧社会逃难的事情。他说：“那时候我们有一段顺口溜：身披麻片不抗冻，烧堆篝火把命救，烤完前胸烤后背，挨过一冬又一冬。”讲完，他解开棉衣让我看，只见前胸后背一片黑疤，旧社会留下的罪证还历历在目。这一切，都给了我深刻的教育。
    贫下中农教育了我，我的感情有了初步变化，我的心开始与贫下中农的心贴在一起了。我把贫下中农对旧社会的仇恨和对新社会的热爱，集中到故事里，觉得故事里的爹娘、姐妹就是自己的亲爹娘、亲姐妹，自己就是故事里的小弟弟。每讲到悲惨处忍不住痛哭失声，讲到翻身得解放又不禁破涕为笑。群众听了都很激动，有时全场悲痛不止。
    我讲的故事，在群众中引起了强烈的反响。许多人说：“讲得比白毛女还苦。”但是，也有人说：“讲得不赖，就是光苦啦”。这个意见使我深受启示。毛主席说过：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。”讲故事不能光叫人感到苦，还应该叫人对敌人感到恨，只有对敌人无比仇恨，才能产生巨大的物质力量，去粉碎整个旧世界！我为什么对敌人恨得不够呢？根本问题还是小资产阶级的思想感情没有完全转变过来，用小资产阶级的“软骨头”气代替了无产阶级的“硬骨头”劲。
    要彻底改造小资产阶级感情，只有继续向工农兵学习。于是，我特别注意向那些英雄人物学习。走到哪个村，我就去贫下中农中间听可歌可泣的革命故事。刘春老大爷的儿子刘士隋烈士壮烈牺牲的故事最使我感动。敌人把他绑赴刑场，叫他跪下，他昂首厉声回答：“共产党人不会下跪！”敌人砍掉了他的右腿，他躺在血泊中还骂道：“匪徒们，你们的寿命不长了，人民要跟你们算这笔血账。你杀了我刘士隋，杀不完所有的共产党！”最后，在“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”的口号声中壮烈牺牲。听完这个故事，我顿时觉得浑身是劲，懂得了一个革命者应该有什么样的气节，懂得了在故事里面应该如何表现工农兵，懂得了应该用这些硬骨头劲去激励人民，化悲愤为力量，把革命进行到底。从此，我再讲故事的时候，就不觉得自己只是个可怜的受苦人了，而觉得自己像刘士隋那样，是一块“硬骨头”了。贫下中农也反映说：“听了故事，浑身是劲！”我的思想改造还刚刚开始，故事还讲得不好，但是我开始懂得：一个文艺工作者真正要为工农兵服务，就必须首先深入工农兵群众，与工农兵结合，好好地改造思想。
