Nepalese friends enthusiastically praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

The world's revolutionary people support China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shattered the imperialists' and modern revisionists' delusions of "peaceful evolution" in China.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nepalese friends have warmly praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao.

A student named Pradhan told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has uprooted the roots of revisionism in China, ensuring that China will not change its color. This is a great joy for the people of the world who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism." He said, "Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest and wisest leader of our time. Only under the leadership of Chairman Mao can such a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution be launched."

A journalist said, "Imperialism and revisionism viciously slander China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which precisely proves that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent." He went on to point out, "Chairman Mao said, 'Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic.' Imperialism and modern revisionism want to implement 'peaceful evolution' in China, but the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has shattered the imperialists' and modern revisionists' delusions. This is the reason why imperialism and modern revisionism slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

A young man named Sharma said, "Chairman Mao said, 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' Imperialism and modern revisionism oppose China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We—friends of China and all peace-loving people in the world—fully support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu: The "Chinese Picture Exhibition" held in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, successfully concluded on the 11th. The people who visited the exhibition expressed their boundless love for Chairman Mao and enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

An elderly woman who came to visit said, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the people of the world. The people of the world love Chairman Mao because Chairman Mao brings blessings to the people of the world."

The audience enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao.

A student named Biraja wrote after visiting, "All revolutionaries are happy about the Cultural Revolution currently underway in China." Some students from southern Nepal read books about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the exhibition hall. One of them said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent because this revolution has uprooted the roots of revisionism in China. This is a great contribution to the people of the world who are fighting against American imperialism and modern revisionism. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

The "Chinese Picture Exhibition" was organized by the Chinese Embassy in Nepal. The exhibition featured pictures of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's socialist construction, and China's support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    据新华社加德满都电  尼泊尔朋友热烈赞扬毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命好得很。
    一个名叫普拉德汉的学生对新华社记者说：“无产阶级文化革命拔掉了中国的修正主义根子，使得中国不会改变颜色，这是正在为反对帝国主义和殖民主义而斗争的世界人民的大喜事。”他说：“毛泽东主席是当代最伟大、最英明的领袖。只有在毛主席领导下的中国才能发动这样的无产阶级文化大革命。”
    一位新闻工作者说：“帝国主义和修正主义恶毒地诬蔑中国的无产阶级文化大革命，这恰好证明，无产阶级文化大革命好得很。”他接着指出：“毛主席说：‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。’帝国主义和现代修正主义要在中国实行‘和平演变’，而文化大革命粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义的痴心妄想。这就是帝国主义和现代修正主义诬蔑文化大革命的原因。”
    一位名叫沙尔玛的青年说：“毛主席说：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’帝国主义和现代修正主义反对中国的无产阶级文化大革命。我们——中国的朋友和世界一切爱好和平的人民，却完全支持无产阶级文化大革命。”
