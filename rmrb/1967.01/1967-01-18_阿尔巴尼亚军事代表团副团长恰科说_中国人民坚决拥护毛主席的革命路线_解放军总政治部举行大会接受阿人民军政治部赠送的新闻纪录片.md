The Chinese People's Liberation Army General Political Department held a meeting today to accept the newsreels donated by the Albanian People's Army Political Department.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 17th, the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Political Department held a meeting this afternoon to accept the newsreels donated by the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee member, Albanian People's Army Political Department Head, and Albanian Military Delegation Deputy Head Hito Chako on behalf of the Albanian People's Army Political Department.

Members of the Albanian Military Delegation attended the meeting.

CPC Central Committee member and Chinese People's Liberation Army General Political Department Director Xiao Hua, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Political Department Deputy Director Yuan Ziqin, and relevant officials from the PLA such as Tan Jia Shu, Zhang Kuiyi, Xu Wenlie, Pan Zhenwu, Liu Han, and Li Wei, as well as more than a thousand PLA officers and soldiers attended the meeting.

The newsreels donated by the Albanian People's Army Political Department are "Marching Through the Snow Mountains," "Self-Reliance," and "Barren Land." These three films record the vibrant life of the Albanian People's Army under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, who heads the Albanian Labor Party, holding a gun in one hand and a pickaxe in the other, to defend and build socialism and advance on the revolutionary path.

Comrade Chako spoke at the meeting. He first conveyed the fraternal and combatant greetings from the armed forces of the People's Republic of Albania to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He said, "As in other areas, our army has learned a lot from the rich experience of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army in combining education, training, and labor. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, guided by Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings on integrating military, agricultural, industrial, and civilian affairs, has become a great school. In this school, the brave builders and steadfast defenders of the revolutionary and socialist cause of great China are being tempered."

Comrade Chako said, "We are witnessing the great Chinese people, the glorious Communist Party of China, and the heroic Chinese army firmly united around the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, resolutely supporting Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist proletarian revolutionary line. With Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, they are launching a total offensive to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly smash the bourgeois and revisionist line. This is because the revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong is the line to defend and deepen the socialist revolution, the line to prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, and the line to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout great China to the end."

Comrade Xiao Hua spoke at the meeting. He, on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Political Department and all the officers and soldiers, expressed heartfelt thanks. He said, "Through these three films, we will once again see the heroic Albanian People's Army, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, beloved by the Albanian people, achieving brilliant results on the revolutionary path and in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. We are confident that through the screening of these three films, the fraternal friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania will be further enhanced."

This morning, some members of the Albanian Military Delegation, accompanied by Vice Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Peng Shaohui, visited the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Museum.

    阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团副团长恰科说
    中国人民坚决拥护毛主席的革命路线
    解放军总政治部举行大会接受阿人民军政治部赠送的新闻纪录片
    据新华社十七日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部今天下午举行大会，接受阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部主任、阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团副团长希托·恰科代表阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部赠送的新闻纪录片。
    阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团成员出席了大会。
    中共中央委员、中国人民解放军总政治部主任萧华，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任袁子钦，解放军各有关方面负责同志谭家述、张奎乙、徐文烈、潘振武、刘汉、李伟，以及解放军指战员一千多人出席了大会。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军政治部赠送的新闻纪录片是《雪山行军》、《自力更生》、《不毛之地》。这三部影片纪录了阿尔巴尼亚人民军在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，一手拿枪，一手拿镐，为保卫和建设社会主义，在革命化道路上前进的沸腾生活。
    恰科同志在大会上致词。他首先向中国人民解放军指战员们转达了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国武装部队的兄弟的战斗的敬礼。他说，和在其他方面一样，我们军队在教育、训练同劳动相结合方面，从英勇的中国人民解放军的丰富经验中学到了许多东西。中国人民解放军依据毛泽东主席关于把军学、军农、军工、军民都兼起来的教导，变成了一所大学校。在这所大学校里锻炼着伟大人民中国的革命和社会主义事业的英勇建设者和坚定的保卫者。
    恰科同志说，我们正在亲眼看到，伟大的中国人民、光荣的中国共产党、英勇的中国军队正坚强地团结在伟大领袖毛泽东主席的周围，坚决拥护毛主席的马克思列宁主义的无产阶级革命路线。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，投入了为完全、彻底、干净粉碎资产阶级、修正主义路线的总攻击。这是因为毛泽东同志代表的革命路线是保卫和深入进行社会主义革命的路线，是防止产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的路线，是把正在整个伟大中国进行的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的路线。
    萧华同志在大会上致答谢词。他代表中国人民解放军总政治部和全军的干部战士表示衷心的感谢。他说，通过这三部影片，我们将再一次看到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军，在阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，在革命化的道路上和在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争中，所取得的光辉成就。我们深信，通过这三部影片的放映，将进一步增进中、阿两国人民、两国军队之间的兄弟友谊。
    今天上午，阿尔巴尼亚军事代表团部分同志在中国人民解放军副总参谋长彭绍辉的陪同下，参观了中国人民革命军事博物馆。
