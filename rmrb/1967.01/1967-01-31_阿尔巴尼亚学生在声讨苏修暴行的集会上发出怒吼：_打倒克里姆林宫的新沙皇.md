Albanian students at a rally denouncing Soviet revisionist atrocities roared: Down with the new tsars of the Kremlin!

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Tirana on the 30th, on the 28th, students from the University of Tirana, the Higher Agricultural Institute of Tirana, and the Chuvaani Normal School in Tirana held meetings and unanimously passed letters of support for Chinese revolutionary students who have been brutally persecuted by the Soviet revisionist leadership.

The letter of support from all students at the University of Tirana stated, "The firm stance of Chinese students in Europe has shown the world the revolutionary determination of heroic Chinese youth, and it has shown that Chinese youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought are good at overcoming all difficulties to achieve victory." The letter emphasized, "We believe that this bloody atrocity by the Soviet revisionist leadership will make you even more determined and resolute in the struggle to completely and thoroughly eliminate modern revisionism. At the same time, we believe that your heroic spirit will inspire the true Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary youth in the Soviet Union to wage a noble struggle to smash the Soviet revisionist leadership. We firmly believe that the dark clouds over the Soviet Union will be blown away by the revolutionary storm, and the day will come when the great Soviet people rise up to resist the revisionist rulers who have usurped power and are restoring capitalism. The banner of Marxism-Leninism will surely fly high over the homeland of Lenin and Stalin."

Students at the Higher Agricultural Institute of Tirana pointed out in their letter of support that the new tsars of the Kremlin—Brezhnev and Kosygin—have usurped power in the Soviet Union and are opposing all revolutionaries who defend Marxism-Leninism like executioners. The letter expressed the belief that, "The Soviet people with a glorious revolutionary tradition and the Bolsheviks will not allow the achievements of Lenin and Stalin to be trampled on for long. We of this generation will witness the downfall of the revisionist dictators and the emergence of a new revolutionary Soviet Union."

　　阿尔巴尼亚学生在声讨苏修暴行的集会上发出怒吼：
　　打倒克里姆林宫的新沙皇
    据新华社地拉那三十日电　二十八日，阿尔巴尼亚地拉那大学、地拉那高等农学院、地拉那楚瓦尼师范学院等院校学生分别举行集会，一致通过了致遭受苏修领导集团野蛮迫害的中国革命留学生的声援信。
    地拉那大学全体学生声援信说，中国留欧学生的坚定立场“向全世界表明了英雄的中国青年的革命决心，表明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的中国青年善于排除一切困难去争取胜利”。声援信强调说：“我们相信，苏修统治集团的这一血腥暴行使你们在完全彻底消灭现代修正主义的斗争中更加坚定，更加坚决。同时我们相信，你们的英雄气概将鼓舞苏联的真正马克思列宁主义者和革命青年为粉碎苏联修正主义领导集团而进行的崇高斗争。我们毫不动摇地坚信，笼罩在苏联上空的乌云将被革命风暴吹散，伟大的苏联人民起来反击篡夺政权并正在复辟资本主义的修正主义统治者的日子，必将来临，马克思列宁主义的旗帜必将在列宁、斯大林的故乡上空高高飘扬。”
    地拉那高等农学院的学生在声援信中指出，克里姆林宫的新沙皇——勃列日涅夫、柯西金篡夺了苏联政权，象刽子手似地反对一切捍卫马克思列宁主义的革命者。声援信表示相信，“有着光荣革命传统的苏联人民和布尔什维克不会长期允许列宁、斯大林的业绩被人践踏。我们这一代将成为修正主义独裁专政者垮台和新的革命的苏联出现的见证人”。
