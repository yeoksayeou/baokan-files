Seize back the power in the financial and commercial system for the revolutionary faction of the proletariat.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, expressed warm greetings to all revolutionary rebel fighters.

The rally read out the "Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao" and the "Emergency Telegram."

Xinhua News Agency, January 21st: The first group of revolutionary rebels from various systems in the country, totaling 100,000 from the financial and commercial system, held a grand rally at the Beijing Workers' Stadium on the 18th. They vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to enthusiastically respond to the great call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, to learn from the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai, to resolutely oppose economism, and to thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. They will seize back all the power usurped by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and put it in the hands of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat.

At the rally, revolutionary rebel fighters from the capital and from other places formed a mighty revolutionary army. People were full of fighting spirit, rubbing their fists and sharpening their wits, shouting slogans that shook the heavens. The entire venue presented a majestic scene of a victorious advance.

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Li Xiannian, and other central leaders attended the rally. In his speech, Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, expressed warm greetings to all revolutionary rebel fighters. Comrades Zhou Enlai and Li Xiannian also walked around the venue to meet with everyone, congratulating and supporting the revolutionary rebels who have begun to unite and fight on the financial and commercial front. During Comrade Zhou Enlai's speech and his meeting with everyone, people waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted in unison and rhythmically: "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!"

At the meeting, the "Emergency Telegram of the Rally of Revolutionary Rebels in the Financial and Commercial System Opposing Economism and Thoroughly Smashing the New Counterattack of the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" was read out. The telegram stated: "The financial and commercial system is a very important front in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The class enemies want to promote economism and material incentives, and they will do so through this channel. Therefore, to thoroughly smash reactionary economism, the revolutionary rebels on our financial and commercial front bear a particularly heavy responsibility."

The "Emergency Telegram" made twelve urgent appeals.

The "Emergency Telegram" said: "Revolutionary rebels across the country, let us unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely oppose economism, thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, launch a nationwide class struggle, and struggle for our own destiny in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, for our own destiny in the struggle of criticism and rectification, for our own destiny in production and work, and for our own destiny in the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist state!"

The rally also read out the "Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao." The telegram said:

"We—all the revolutionary rebel fighters from the first united financial and commercial system in various systems across the country—pay our highest proletarian cultural revolutionary combat salute to you, the reddest red sun in our hearts!"

"Dear Chairman Mao! At this critical moment of struggle, you have once again pointed out the direction of our struggle and our combat tasks for us revolutionary rebels. Your voice has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary rebels, greatly crushed the arrogance of the class enemies, given us the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest support."

"Today, the revolutionary rebels of the financial and commercial system who are forever loyal to you are gathering in Beijing, resolutely responding to your great battle call to oppose economism and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, learning from the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai, promoting revolution and production, and vowing to achieve double victories in revolution and production!"

The rally began with the solemn playing of "The East Is Red." The entire audience of 100,000 people held copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud Chairman Mao's teachings: "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties and win victory."

The presiding chairman said in his speech, "Now is the great moment for us to stand up and fight to the death to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! We must firmly guard our posts, use our lives and blood to guard the trade gate, the financial gate, the bank gate... and fight to the death against all kinds of economism and revisionism. The primary issue of the revolution is the issue of power. We must firmly seize the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the destiny of the socialist economy, in the hands of the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat. This is the most glorious and great mission entrusted to us by history. We firmly believe that the future sky will definitely be the sky of Mao Zedong Thought! The future earth will definitely be the earth of Mao Zedong Thought! The future world will definitely be a brilliant new world of Mao Zedong Thought, shining red!"

Following this, representatives from the Revolutionary Liaison Station of the Ministry of Finance, the Revolutionary Headquarters of the People's Bank of China in Shanghai, the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Headquarters, the Revolutionary Headquarters of the Shanghai Branch of the People's Bank of China, and the Revolutionary Vanguard Headquarters of Financial and Commercial Workers in Beijing spoke at the rally. The representative from the Nanjing region of the Red Revolutionary Headquarters of Jiangsu Province made a written report. They sternly denounced the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the stubborn elements who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, using reactionary revisionist economism to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They stated that all revolutionary rebels in the financial and commercial system must stand together, rebel against those class enemies, and rebel to the end, not stopping until complete victory is achieved. They said in their speeches:

"We have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao. We must definitely make Chairman Mao proud. We must take Shanghai's revolutionary rebels as an example, further unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly grasp the leadership of the Cultural Revolution and production in our own hands.

"We must sternly warn those bastard bosses: you used to suppress the revolutionary rebels with violence, but now you cannot buy us with money. We are loyal to Chairman Mao and will forever have red hearts to do revolution. If you dare to sabotage socialism, we will smash your dog heads!"

During the rally, the entire audience of 100,000 people raised their arms and shouted: "Resolutely respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to 'grasp revolution and promote production'!" "Smash reactionary economism and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line!" "Go back home and make revolution! Go back home and thoroughly make revolution!" "All revolutionary rebels in the financial and commercial system unite to achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution!" "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions!" "Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!"

The fighting atmosphere stirred up every revolutionary rebel fighter, and the revolutionary scene made everyone's blood boil. At the end of the rally, the entire audience stood up, and Comrade Zhou Enlai led everyone to sing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."
