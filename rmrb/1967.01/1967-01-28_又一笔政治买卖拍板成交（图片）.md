Another political deal has been sealed. On January 27, the so-called "Treaty on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space" was signed by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. This is yet another product of the counter-revolutionary collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The image shows the signing ceremony in Moscow, where Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko (right) and the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Llewellyn Thompson, exchanged glances after sealing the deal.
