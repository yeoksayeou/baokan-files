	Often read the "Three Old Articles," heart red and will firm,
	"Completely" and "thoroughly" for the people,
	Life and death are cast aside!
	Often read the "Three Old Articles," courage great and daring,
	Face difficulties head-on,
	Wind and rain cannot obstruct!
	Often read the "Three Old Articles," bosom wide and expansive,
	Private thoughts and杂念 all swept away,
	Revolution in the heart!
	Often read the "Three Old Articles," transform worldview,
	The red sun shines on the long journey,
	Head held high, forever forward!
