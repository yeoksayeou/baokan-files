    Collect More, Manage Carefully, Utilize Ingeniously
    The public canteen of the Liu Guancun Production Team in our commune mainly burned coal and firewood in the past. This year, the canteen plans to use thatch instead of coal and firewood, and has successfully rebuilt "Plum Blossom Stoves" and "Suction Stoves" suitable for burning thatch. In order to make good use of thatch, the production team's Party branch mobilized commune members to conduct discussions. In three days, commune members put forward 410 rationalization proposals. The Party branch summarized them into three points: collect more firewood, manage firewood carefully, and utilize firewood ingeniously.
    After the autumn harvest, there were many firewood sources in the fields. The production team organized 50 auxiliary laborers to specialize in collecting firewood. At the same time, it mobilized commune members doing other farm work to combine it with firewood collection, ensuring that firewood collection had quotas and that there were rewards for exceeding quotas. In half a month, the entire team collected more than 132,000 catties of firewood. While vigorously collecting firewood, the Party branch also mobilized commune members to summarize their experience in managing firewood over the years, adopting management methods such as stacking stalks, sealing soft firewood with mud, and storing broken firewood in warehouses, ensuring that not a single piece of firewood was damaged and that every piece was useful. In addition, the Party branch also convened more than 20 commune members with firewood-burning experience for discussions, summarizing firewood-saving experiences such as burning dry firewood, adding small bundles, burning evenly, frequently removing ash, frequently cleaning chimneys, and frequently sweeping the bottom of pots. The canteen cooks launched a firewood-saving competition, saving more than 190 catties of firewood a day. Thanks to the above measures, this production team not only solved the difficulty of insufficient firewood, but also saved more than 100,000 catties of sorghum stalks, wheat stalks, etc., originally planned for firewood.

    多拾　精管　巧用
    我们公社刘官屯生产队的公共食堂，过去主要是烧煤炭和木柴，今年，食堂计划用茅柴代替煤炭和木柴，并且已经改建成功了适合烧茅柴的“梅花灶”、“吸风灶”。为了用好茅柴，生产队党支部发动社员开展讨论，三天的时间，社员就提出了四百一十条合理化建议，党支部把它归纳成三条，就是多拾柴，精管柴，巧用柴。
    秋收后，地里的柴源很多，生产队组织了五十个辅助劳力专门拾柴。同时发动做其他农活的社员结合拾柴，做到拾柴有定额，超额有奖励。半月时间，全队就拾柴十三万二千多斤。在大搞拾柴的同时，党支部又发动社员总结了历年来保管烧柴的经验，采取了秸秆上垛、软柴泥封、碎柴入库的保管办法，保证烧柴一棵不损，棵棵顶用。此外，党支部还召集了二十多名有烧柴经验的社员座谈，总结出烧干柴、添小把、烧的匀、勤掏灰、勤打烟囱、勤扫锅底等省柴经验。食堂炊事员开展了省柴竞赛，一天可节省烧柴一百九十多斤。由于采取了以上措施，这个生产队不仅解决了烧柴不足的困难，还可以节省出原计划做烧柴用的高粱秸、麦秆等十万多斤。
