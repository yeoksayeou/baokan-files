Comrade Pak Jung-ae, Comrade Deputy Premier Jung Joon-taek, Comrade Lee Gye-baek, Comrade Kim Se-bong, dear comrades and friends:

First of all, please allow me to express my sincere thanks to Comrade Deputy Premier Jung Joon-taek, who came from afar to accompany us on our visit to the Hamhung and Chongjin areas and who is so graciously hosting us tonight. I would also like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the leading comrades of the North Hamgyong Province Party and government and, through you, to all the people of Chongjin and North Hamgyong Province.

Although our visit to your beautiful city is only for a short day, the glorious achievements of the people of Chongjin and the People's Army troops on the front lines of national construction and defense have left us with a deep and positive impression. We are pleased to see that Chongjin's industrial construction and production are developing at a flying pace, riding the Chollima. Our close comrades-in-arms, the People's Army troops, are firmly guarding the eastern coast and sky of their homeland, as well as the entire socialist camp. We regard every achievement you have made as our own and are sincerely happy for you. We wish you continued new and greater victories in the future.

Comrades, our friendly visit to our fraternal and close neighbor is coming to an end soon. The nearly twenty-day visit has been a vivid and profound education for all the comrades of our delegation. We have seen that the Korean people have made great contributions to resisting the common and ferocious enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, and to defending peace in the Far East and the world. After defeating the American aggressors, the Korean people, under the correct leadership of the Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, quickly healed the wounds of war with their diligent hands and through arduous struggle. Then, with the high speed of the galloping Chollima, they marched forward on the road of industrial and agricultural construction and established a solid socialist economic base. At present, the entire Korean people are inspired by the bright prospects of the Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy proposed by the Workers' Party and are marching with full confidence towards a better future. When we saw the powerful industrial base that has been magnificently established during our visits to Wonsan, Hamhung, and today in Chongjin, we could not help but be deeply moved by the Korean people's soaring enthusiasm and boundless wisdom. Historical facts clearly prove that the Korean people under the guidance of Comrade Kim Il-sung and the Workers' Party are a heroic and fearless people. You were unyielding and fought heroically in the face of ferocious enemies; you did not flinch in the face of numerous difficulties and advanced bravely; and finally defeated the enemy, overcame the difficulties, and achieved one brilliant victory after another. Your great heroic spirit as proletarian fighters has greatly inspired the fighting courage of the oppressed people all over the world and has set a learning example for us. The magnificent achievements created by the Korean people in defending the cause of peace and socialism will remain in the world forever, just like the magnificent Mount Kumgang.

Comrades and friends, from the moment we stepped onto your beautiful land, we have been living in an atmosphere filled with brotherly warmth. Everywhere we go, we have been received by the Korean people and People's Army comrades with family-like hospitality. We believe that this is a sincere manifestation of your deep friendship towards the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We must convey all of your brotherly affection to the Chinese people and all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We have always held such an unwavering belief that the fighting friendship and unity between our two peoples and their armies, which are cemented with blood, will grow day by day and cannot be destroyed by any force. What firmly binds us together are the invincible principles of Marxism-Leninism, the common cause of resisting imperialist aggression, defending the independence of our respective countries, and striving for the unification of our respective countries, and the common ideal of striving for the victory of socialism and communism in the world. Under no circumstances will the Chinese people ever stand with the fraternal Korean people. If the imperialists dare to invade the Korean people, who are connected with us by flesh and blood and are as close as brothers, the Chinese people will once again fight shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people under the banner of resisting aggression, defending peace, and defending socialism, until the aggressors are completely eliminated and final and complete victory is achieved.

Dear comrades, on the eve of our departure, with a feeling of reluctance, Comrade Luo Ruiqing, all the comrades of the delegation, and I would like to take this opportunity to once again express our high respect and heartfelt gratitude to Premier Kim Il-sung, the beloved leader of the Korean people, to General Kim Kwang-hyup, and to all the leading comrades of the Korean Party, government, and army. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Korean people and the People's Army comrades who have warmly welcomed and kindly received us. We express our heartfelt gratitude to Comrades Choi Yong-jin, Kim Chang-bong, Suk San, Heo Bong-hak, Choi Kwang, and all other comrades who have worked hard to accompany us on our visits to various places, and wish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea continued prosperity and strength, wish the heroic Korean People's Army new achievements in the cause of defending the motherland and defending peace, and wish the fraternal Korean people boundless happiness.

I propose a toast:

To the fighting friendship cemented with blood between the peoples and armies of China and Korea!
To the consolidation and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
To the health of the leading comrades of the Korean Workers' Party and government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung!
To the health of General Kim Kwang-hyup and all officers and soldiers of the People's Army!
To the health of Comrade Pak Jung-ae, Comrade Deputy Premier Jung Joon-taek, Comrade Lee Gye-baek, and Comrade Kim Se-bong!
To the health of all comrades present!
To world peace!
Cheers!

专栏：

    贺龙元帅的讲话亲爱的朴正爱同志，亲爱的郑准泽副首相同志，亲爱的李光实委员长同志，亲爱的金世凤委员长同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    首先请允许我对远道前来陪同我们在咸兴、清津地区参观访问，又在今晚盛情款待我们的郑准泽副首相同志致以诚恳的谢意，向给我们以热情欢迎的咸镜北道党政领导同志并通过你们向清津市和咸镜北道全体人民表示衷心的感谢。
    我们在你们美丽的城市的访问虽然只有短短一天的时间，但是，清津市人民和人民军部队在建设祖国和保卫祖国战线上所取得的光辉成绩，同样给我们留下了深刻的、良好的印象。我们高兴地看到，清津市的工业建设和生产，正以跨上千里马的飞跃步伐向前发展；我们亲密的战友人民军部队正在坚强地守卫着自己祖国的、同时也是整个社会主义阵营的东方海岸和天空。你们所取得的每一项成就，我们都看作是自己的成就一样，感到由衷的高兴，并预祝你们今后不断地获得新的更大的胜利。
    同志们，我们这次在兄弟的亲密邻邦所进行的友好访问，很快就要结束了。将近二十天的访问，对于我们代表团的全体同志来说，是受到了一次生动的深刻的教育，我们看到，为着反抗全世界人民共同的凶恶敌人美帝国主义、保卫远东及世界和平，朝鲜人民曾经作出了巨大的贡献。在战胜了美国侵略者以后，朝鲜人民在以金日成同志为首的劳动党的正确领导下，以勤劳的双手，经过艰苦奋斗，很快地医治了战争创伤，接着又以奔腾的千里马的高速度在工农业建设道路上阔步前进，建立了巩固的社会主义经济基础。目前，全体朝鲜人民正在劳动党提出的人民经济发展七年计划的光辉前景鼓舞下，信心百倍地走向更加美好的未来。当我们在元山、咸兴和今天在清津的访问中，看到强大的工业基地已雄伟地建立起来了，不能不为朝鲜人民的冲天干劲和无穷智慧所深深感动。历史事实清楚地证明了，在金日成同志和劳动党教导下的朝鲜人民是英雄的无畏的人民。你们在凶恶的敌人面前，坚强不屈，英勇战斗；在重重困难面前毫不退缩，勇往直前；终于打败了敌人，战胜了困难，取得了一个接一个的辉煌胜利。你们这种伟大的无产阶级战士的英雄气概极大地鼓舞了全世界被压迫人民的斗争勇气，为我们树立了一个学习的榜样。朝鲜人民为保卫和平和社会主义事业所创造的丰功伟绩将同雄伟壮丽的金刚山一样，永留人间，万古长存。
    同志们，朋友们：自从跨上你们美丽的国土那一时刻起，我们就一直生活在洋溢着兄弟般的温暖的气氛中，我们每到一处都受到朝鲜人民和人民军战友们亲如家人的接待，我们认为这是你们对中国人民和中国人民解放军深厚情谊的真诚表现。我们一定要把你们这种兄弟之情全部传达给中国人民和中国人民解放军全体官兵。我们从来就抱着这样坚定不移的信念，以鲜血凝成的我们两国人民及其军队之间的战斗友谊和团结必将与日俱增，它是任何力量所破坏不了的，把我们牢固地结合在一起的是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义原则，是反抗帝国主义侵略、保卫各自祖国独立、争取各自祖国统一的共同事业，是争取社会主义和共产主义在全世界胜利的共同理想。无论在什么样的情况下，中国人民都一定同兄弟的朝鲜人民永远站在一 起。如果帝国主义者胆敢再来侵犯同我们血肉相连、情同手足的朝鲜人民，中国人民一定会在反抗侵略、保卫和平、保卫社会主义的旗帜下，再一次同朝鲜人民并肩作战，直到彻底消灭侵略者取得最后的完全的胜利。
    亲爱的同志们，在我们即将分别的前夕，我们满怀着惜别的心情，我和罗瑞卿同志以及代表团的全体同志们，借此机会再一次向朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成首相，向金光侠大将和朝鲜党、政府以及军队的所有领导同志，表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。向给我们以热情欢迎和亲切接待的朝鲜人民和人民军战友们表示衷心的感谢，向辛苦地陪同我们在各地访问的崔勇进、金昌凤、石山、许凤学、崔光等同志和所有其他同志表示衷心的感谢，并祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国日益繁荣富强，祝英雄的朝鲜人民军在保卫祖国、保卫和平的事业中不断取得新的成就，祝兄弟的朝鲜人民幸福无疆。
    我提议：
    为中朝两国人民和军队之间以鲜血凝成的战斗友谊，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的巩固团结，
    为以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党和政府领导同志的健康，
    为金光侠大将和人民军全体官兵的健康，
    为朴正爱同志、郑准泽副首相同志、李光实委员长同志、金世凤委员长同志的健康，
    为所有在座同志的健康，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
