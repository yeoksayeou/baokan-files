Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd: Guinean President Sékou Touré sent telegrams to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld and US President Eisenhower, protesting the US's forceful attempt to have a group appointed by Kasavubu usurp the Congo's seat in the United Nations, thereby depriving the representatives of Lumumba's legitimate government of the right to attend the United Nations General Assembly. The telegrams were circulated at the United Nations on the 21st.

In his telegram to Hammarskjöld, Sékou Touré expressed extreme anger at the US's attempt to obstruct a just resolution to the Congo issue in the United Nations. The telegram stated, "We protest the position taken by the American bloc, which will undoubtedly create serious problems for the African continent."

Touré informed Hammarskjöld in the telegram that if the United Nations General Assembly passes the resolution proposed by the United States, Guinea will not participate in the United Nations Mediation Committee composed of fifteen Asian and African countries to resolve the Congo's internal political differences.

The telegram stated, "The mission of this committee has been seriously jeopardized. It is due to the interference of many European countries and the United States in the Congo issue that sending this mediation committee (to the Congo) has become inappropriate."

In his telegram to Eisenhower, Touré expressed concern about the US's biased position in the Congo situation. The telegram requested that the United States cease supporting the enemies of African liberation, who are using all means to oppose the legitimate government of the Congo in order to undermine the unity and territorial integrity of the Congolese nation.

The telegram warned that if the United States persists in its aforementioned position, Guinea will withdraw from the Mediation Committee and adopt any policy in African affairs that is in the interests of the Congo.

    杜尔致电哈马舍尔德和艾森豪威尔
    谴责美国干涉刚果的罪恶活动
    抗议美国阴谋剥夺卢蒙巴政府在联大中合法权利
    据新华社22日讯　纽约消息：几内亚总统塞古·杜尔打电报给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德和美国总统艾森豪威尔，抗议美国强使卡萨武布任命的一批人窃据刚果在联合国中的席位，从而剥夺卢蒙巴合法政府的代表出席联合国大会的权利的阴谋活动。电报已于21日在联合国散发。
    塞古·杜尔在给哈马舍尔德的电报中，对美国在联合国中阻挠刚果问题获得公正解决的企图表示极大的愤怒。电报说，“我们抗议美国集团采取的立场，这种立场无疑将给非洲大陆制造严重问题。”
    杜尔在电报中通知哈马舍尔德：假使联合国大会通过美国提出的决议，几内亚将不参加前往解决刚果国内政治分歧的、由十五个亚非国家组成的联合国调解委员会。
    电报说，“这个委员会的任务已经遭到严重的危害。正是由于许多欧洲国家和美国对刚果问题的干涉，派遣这个调解委员会（去刚果）已成为不适当。”
    杜尔在给艾森豪威尔的电报中，对美国在刚果局势中的偏袒的立场表示忧虑。电报要求美国停止支持非洲解放的敌人的地位，这些人为了破坏刚果国家的统一和领土完整正在使用各种手段反对刚果合法政府。
    电报警告说，如果美国坚持它的上述立场，几内亚将退出调解委员会，而在非洲事务中采取任何符合刚果利益的政策。
