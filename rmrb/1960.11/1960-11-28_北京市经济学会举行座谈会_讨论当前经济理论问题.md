Beijing Economic Society Holds Symposium to Discuss Current Economic Theory Issues

The Beijing Economic Society recently held a series of symposiums to discuss the two issues of "Agriculture is the Foundation of the National Economy" and "The Economic Crisis in the United States."

Regarding the issue of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, the comrades who spoke unanimously believed that Comrade Mao Zedong's idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy is very rich and profound in content. For example, regarding the leap forward that agriculture can achieve under the socialist system, the specific conditions and ways for the leap forward; regarding the speed of agricultural development in socialist construction, which should be adapted to the speed of industrial development; regarding raising the development of agriculture and the relationship between agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry to the level of understanding the path of industrialization; regarding heavy industry taking agriculture as an important market; regarding the path and form of socialist transformation of agriculture, and the path of agricultural technological transformation; regarding the policy of taking grain as the key link, diversifying operations, making overall arrangements, and promoting both crop cultivation and animal husbandry in agricultural development; regarding the policy of combining high yield and multiple harvests with multiple varieties and multiple harvests; regarding the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, etc., are all creative developments of Marxist-Leninist economic theory. Comrade Mao Zedong's idea has opened the door to a new world and a new realm for our theoretical research workers, and has also put forward new and arduous tasks for us. In the future, we must delve into reality, combine with the actual economic life, and relate to the relationship between today's and tomorrow's construction to study this idea and solve a series of specific problems in my country's economic construction.

Regarding the issue of the economic crisis in the United States, many speakers unanimously believed that the United States has entered the initial stage of a new economic crisis. Some comrades pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the US industrial production index has declined significantly, mainly in the durable goods industry, especially the steel industry, automobile manufacturing, and construction industry sectors, which are known as the three pillars of the United States; at the same time, the operating rate is very low; fixed capital investment has been at a low level and there is still a trend to reduce it; sales have declined, inventories have increased, and the amount of unfulfilled orders is decreasing. All this shows that the growth of US production capacity exceeds the growth of production, and the growth of production exceeds the growth of sales is becoming increasingly acute, indicating that the world's number one imperialist, the United States, has experienced an economic crisis of overproduction. Some comrades pointed out that this US economic crisis has some new characteristics, such as the rapid and large decline in industrial production; the interlacing of industrial and agricultural crises; the occurrence of financial crises and gold outflows in the early stages of the economic crisis, and so on. At a time when the overall crisis of capitalism is constantly deepening and imperialism is rotting day by day, these characteristics are very noteworthy. Some comrades proposed that in order to correctly understand and study the current US economic crisis, we must better study Marxism-Leninism, study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the current political and economic situation in the United States and the entire capitalist world.

The symposium on discussing these two issues is prepared to continue.

    北京市经济学会举行座谈会
    讨论当前经济理论问题
    北京市经济学会在最近连续举行座谈会，讨论“农业是国民经济的基础”和“美国的经济危机”两个问题。
    关于农业是国民经济的基础的问题，发言的同志一致认为，毛泽东同志提出的农业是国民经济的基础的思想，内容非常丰富和深刻。例如，关于社会主义制度下农业可以跃进，跃进的具体条件和途径；关于社会主义建设中农业发展的速度，应该与工业发展的速度相适应；关于把农业的发展和农业、轻工业、重工业之间的关系提高到工业化道路来认识；关于重工业要以农业为重要市场；关于农业社会主义改造的道路和形式，农业技术改造的道路；关于发展农业要以粮为纲，多种经营、全面安排，种植业与畜牧业同时并举的方针；关于高产多收和多种多收相结合的方针；关于农业“八字宪法”等等，都是对马克思列宁主义经济理论的创造性的发展。毛泽东同志的这一思想为我们理论研究工作者打开了新的天地、新的境界的大门，也为我们提出了新的艰巨的任务。今后我们必须深入实际，结合现实的经济生活，联系今天和明天的建设的关系，来研究这一思想，解决我国经济建设中的一系列具体问题。
    关于美国的经济危机的问题，许多发言人一致认为，目前美国已进入新的经济危机的初期阶段。有的同志指出，自今年年初以来，美国工业生产指数下降幅度很大，其中主要是耐用品工业，特别是号称美国三大支柱的钢铁工业、汽车制造业、建筑工业部门的生产下降更是突出；同时，开工率十分低下；固定资本投资一直处于低水平，并且还有削减趋势；销售额下降，存货量增加，未完成订货额在减少。这一切说明美国生产能力的增长超过生产的增长、生产的增长超过销售的增长的情况日益尖锐，说明了世界头号帝国主义美国已经发生生产过剩的经济危机。有的同志指出，这一次美国经济危机具有一些新的特点，例如工业生产下降来势猛，幅度大；工业危机和农业危机交错；在经济危机的初期就发生金融危机和黄金外流现象，等等。在目前资本主义总危机不断加深、帝国主义一天天烂下去的时候，这些特点十分值得注意。有的同志提出，为了正确地认识和研究当前美国的经济危机问题，必须更好地学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，用毛泽东思想来观察和分析当前美国以及整个资本主义世界的政治经济状况。
    关于讨论这两个问题的座谈会准备继续举行。
