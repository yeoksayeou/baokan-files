This newspaper reports from Changsha on the 31st of October: The Hekou Commune Party Committee in Shimen County, Hunan Province, while vigorously carrying out autumn and winter sowing, is adopting comprehensive management methods centered on fertilizer, determined to transform all 4,200 mu of low-yielding fields in the commune before this winter, creating conditions for the continued leap forward in agricultural production next year.

The Hekou Commune is a large mountainous area with scattered fields and barren soil. Since the Great Leap Forward, some work has been carried out in winter each year to transform low-yielding fields, and output has continuously increased. This year, the total output of early and mid-season rice in the commune increased by 18% compared with 1959. After deducting seeds, public grain, and feed grain, the commune sold an average of 250 jin of surplus grain to the state per person. This is a major leap forward compared to the commune's previous state of being a grain-deficient commune. However, compared with other communes, grain output is still not high. In August, the commune Party committee conducted a comprehensive assessment and analysis of the commune's production this year and found that the main reason for the small increase in production was that low-yielding fields were holding back progress. The commune has more than 4,200 mu of low-yielding fields, accounting for 28% of the total paddy field area. The output of these fields is only 200 to 300 jin, which is 50% lower than the output of ordinary fields, and sometimes even less than half. The commune Party committee believes that as long as they are determined to transform all low-yielding fields this autumn and winter, the commune's grain production next year will increase even more substantially. This is a great key to achieving a continued leap forward in agricultural production.

While vigorously carrying out autumn and winter sowing, the commune Party committee launched extensive and in-depth discussions among the masses on how to transform low-yielding fields as early as possible. Everyone raised their understanding through vivid comparisons of facts. The masses believe that seizing the opportunity to transform low-yielding fields in autumn and winter has many benefits: first, there are more sources of fertilizer in autumn, the composting time is longer, the fertilizer efficiency is higher, and the results are achieved with less effort, which is conducive to improving barren soil; second, early plowing and early transformation of the soil, after winter freezing, can make the field soil melt and become alive, and the soil quality becomes loose; third, there are many winter crops this year, and the tasks of spring harvest and rush planting are heavy. Now that the agricultural work that can be done in advance is done as early as possible, it can avoid the situation where labor is too busy during spring plowing next year. Based on unified thinking and understanding, the method of combining cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers was adopted to conduct a comprehensive survey of all fields, and different measures to increase production were studied according to the different reasons for the low yield of different fields.

The main measures currently being taken by this commune to transform low-yielding fields are: First, to expand fertilizer sources and increase fertilizer application. This is an important condition for transforming all low-yielding fields, especially the application of organic fertilizer can achieve the purpose of improving the soil. Each mu of low-yielding field is required to have one mu of green manure, one manure pond, two mu of field should have one pig or cow, and three mu of field should have one sheep. Second, measures for improving the soil were taken according to local conditions and different conditions of low-yielding fields. For example, for fields with shallow mud feet, deep plowing is generally carried out in combination with winter planting. For clay fields, appropriate amounts of river sand are mixed in, and more organic fertilizer is applied. Third, in conjunction with winter water conservancy construction, the commune is building and repairing mountain ponds, focusing on solving the irrigation problem of rain-fed fields.

In order to ensure that the task of transforming low-yielding fields is completed quickly and well, the commune has fixed four commune Party committee members and more than 277 cadres above the level of work group leader to strengthen leadership. Production responsibility systems of assigning leaders, assigning plots, assigning tasks, assigning time, and assigning work points have been generally promoted in various brigades. Qiu Dunguai, the first secretary of the commune Party committee, personally took the lead and conducted a pilot project for improving low-yielding fields in the Hekou Brigade, setting up pacesetters and planting red flags, and convened an on-site meeting of the whole commune on deep plowing, soil improvement, and large-scale production of indigenous fertilizer; then, an on-site meeting on doing a good job of "three clearings" and improving sunshine conditions was held in the Huayuan Brigade to conduct visits, evaluations, and exchanges of experience. In this way, a comparison and competition movement for transforming low-yielding fields was quickly launched throughout the commune between teams, groups, and individuals.

Now, the whole commune has concentrated 81% of its labor force on the front line of agricultural production. Cadres and commune members are all in high spirits and marching towards low-yielding fields with full enthusiasm. By the beginning of October, the whole commune had built 269 pigsties, cattle pens, and sheepfolds beside the low-yielding fields, raising a total of 2,877 pigs, cattle, and sheep, dug 545 field manure pools and manure ponds, planted more than 4,700 mu of green manure, with an average of 1.13 mu of green manure per mu of low-yielding field, and the task of cutting mountain shade and carrying out "three clearings" has been fully completed. In conjunction with winter planting, 6,400 mu of shallow mud-footed fields have been deeply plowed, and 519 mu of heavy clay fields have been mixed with an appropriate amount of river sand. The whole commune has accumulated more than 900,000 dan of fertilizer, with an average of 215 dan per mu of low-yielding field, and some of it has been applied to the fields or composted in the fertilizer pools and manure ponds beside the fields.

    抓住大办农业大办粮食的一个重要环节
    要低产田翻身　争大幅度高产
    河口公社以肥为中心综合治理低产田
    本报长沙31日电　湖南省石门县河口公社党委在大搞秋冬播种的同时，采取以肥料为中心的综合治理办法，决心在今冬以前，就把全社四千二百亩低产田全部改造好，为明年农业生产继续跃进创造条件。
    河口公社是一个大山区，田土分散，土质瘠薄。自大跃进以来，每年冬季陆续进行了一些改造低产田的工作，产量不断增加。今年全社早、中稻总产量比1959年增长18％，除去种子、公粮、饲料粮外，全社每人平均卖了二百五十斤余粮给国家。这比起公社化以前还是缺粮社来说已跃进了一大步，但是和其他公社比较，粮食产量还是不高。8月间，公社党委就对全社今年生产情况进行了全面的摸底分析，发现增产幅度不大的主要原因是低产田拖住了后腿。全社约有四千二百多亩低产田，占稻田总面积的28％，这些田亩产量只二、三百斤，和一般田产量比较要低五成以上，有的甚至相差一倍。公社党委认为，只要下决心在今年秋冬季把全部低产田改造过来，全社明年的粮食生产就会更大幅度的增长，这是实现农业生产继续跃进的一个大窍门。
    公社党委在大搞秋冬播种的同时，就把如何及早改造低产田的问题在群众中开展了广泛而深入的讨论，大家通过生动的对比事实提高了认识。群众都认为抓紧秋冬季改造低产田的好处很多：一是，秋季肥源多，沤制时间长，肥效高，事半功倍，便于改良瘦土；二是，土壤早翻耕，早改造，经过冬季冰冻，可以使田泥融活，土质疏松；三是，今年冬播作物多，来年春收和抢种任务大，现在把能够提前做的农活尽量提前，就可以避免明年春耕时劳力忙不过来。在统一思想认识的基础上，采取干部、技术员、老农三结合的办法，深入田间，对全部田土作了普查，并根据不同田土低产的原因，研究了不同的增产措施。
    这个公社目前改造低产田的主要措施：首先是广辟肥源，增施肥料。这是改造一切低产田的重要条件，特别是施用有机肥料可以达到改良土壤的目的。要求每亩低产田有一亩绿肥、一个粪凼，两亩田有一头猪、牛，三亩田有一只羊。其次，因地制宜，对不同情况的低产田，采取了不同的改良土壤的办法。比如泥脚浅的田，就结合冬种普遍深耕。对粘土田就掺适量的河沙，多施有机质肥。第三，结合冬修水利，全社兴建和整修山塘，着重解决天水田灌溉问题。
    为了使改造低产田的任务完成得又快又好，全社固定四个公社党委委员和二百七十七个作业组长以上的干部加强领导，各大队普遍推行了定领导、定丘块、定任务、定时间、定工分的生产责任制。公社党委第一书记丘敦贵亲自挂帅，在河口大队作改良低产田的试点，树标兵插红旗，召开了全社深耕改土和大造土化肥的现场会；接着又在花园大队召开了搞好“三光”、改善日照条件的现场会，进行参观评比，交流经验。这样，全公社迅速开展了一个队与队、组与组、人与人之间的改造低产田评比竞赛运动。
    现在，全社集中了81％的劳动力投入农业生产第一线，干部和社员都意气风发，干劲十足地向低产田进军。到10月上旬，全社已在低产田边修建了猪牛栏和羊圈二百六十九处，共养猪牛羊二千八百七十七只，挖了田头肥库和粪凼五百四十五个，种了绿肥四千七百多亩，平均每亩低产田已有绿肥一点一三亩，砍山荫搞“三光”的任务已全部完成，结合冬种有六千四百亩浅泥脚田进行了深耕，有五百一十九亩重粘土田搞了适量的河砂。全社已积肥料九十多万担，每亩低产田平均有二百一十五担，一部分已施到田里或沤在田边的肥库粪凼内。
