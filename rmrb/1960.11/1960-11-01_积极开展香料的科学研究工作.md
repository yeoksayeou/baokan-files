Actively Carry Out Scientific Research on Fragrances

Liu Zhujin, Associate Researcher, Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences

Fragrances have a special place in people's daily lives. The star anise, fennel, and peppercorns that our people like to use in cooking are traditional flavoring spices; foods and beverages with the aroma of vanilla, bayberry, oranges, cocoa, cream, etc., are even more delicious. Because many fragrances have bactericidal, insecticidal, or other physiological effects, they can also be directly used as medicines. Sandalwood and wintergreen oil, which are well known to people, have long been included in the pharmacopoeia. In the canned food industry or fruit packaging industry, fragrances are also commonly used preservatives. A large amount of fragrance is always used in the daily necessities of the broad masses of the people such as soap and toothpaste, as well as many other sanitary preparations; even in industries such as paint and leather, fragrances have become an indispensable component. The main use of fragrances is in the fragrance and cosmetic industries. In our socialist country, with the continuous improvement of people's living standards, the consumption of fragrances is also constantly increasing. Since the Great Leap Forward in our country, the emergence of new products such as scented calico and scented ink can not only beautify people's lives, but also become a good story in the international market.

Although the fragrance industry is a small-scale light industry, its output value cannot be ignored. Not only are fragrances expensive products, but many natural plant "essential oils" also have high economic value. For example, according to statistics from relevant departments, 2.2 tons of Litsea cubeba oil can be exchanged for a tractor, 6 kilograms of Clausena lansium oil can be exchanged for one ton of fertilizer, and 37 kilograms of cypress wood brain can be exchanged for one ton of steel plates. An ounce of rose oil or jasmine oil is more expensive than an ounce of gold. The reason why rose oil is so expensive is partly due to its superior quality and also due to its low oil yield, generally between 0.02% and 0.03%. It is estimated that it takes about two million rose flowers to produce one kilogram of rose oil. A lot of labor is required in the cultivation, collection, and processing of flowers. In addition, rose oil is easily deteriorated at high temperatures, so the steam distillation method is generally not used to extract the oil, but the solvent extraction method or the fat absorption method is used instead. The former requires a large amount of expensive extractant (petroleum ether), while the latter requires a lot of skilled labor because of the meticulous and complicated work. These factors greatly increase the cost of rose oil. We know that Bulgaria, which is famous for owning the "Valley of Roses," its fragrance industry occupies an important position in the national economy. Although the foundation of my country's fragrance industry is relatively weak, it has created a lot of wealth for the country after years of development.

          The Variety and Source of Fragrances

There are many types of fragrances, and hundreds of them are frequently used. The source of fragrances is very complex, some of which come from plants, animals, and some from minerals (through processing); some come from deep mountains, and some come from the sea. Generally speaking, it can be divided into four categories: plant essential oils, animal fragrances, resins and gums (these are all natural fragrances) and synthetic fragrances. Plant essential oils are volatile oils extracted from various parts of aromatic plants, such as flowers, leaves, stems, roots, fruits, seeds, and bark. The content of essential oils (oil yield) can be as high as tens of percent (such as clove oil), and as low as a few ten thousandths (such as rose oil). There are many varieties of plant essential oils, and more than 1,000 have been identified. Many "natural single fragrances" can also be separated from these complex essential oils, such as citral from Litsea cubeba oil and menthol from mint oil. Therefore, plant essential oils are currently one of the most important sources of fragrances. Commonly used animal fragrances include musk (from musk deer, produced in Yunnan, Sichuan, Northwest, and Northeast provinces of China), civet (from civet, also known as fragrant cat, the recently discovered nine-section fox in China is also a species of this type), ambergris (a waxy calculus excreted from a whale, weighing one or two kilograms for small ones and more than one hundred kilograms for large ones) and castoreum (from the aquatic animal beaver in the cold zone), etc., which are relatively precious fragrances. Resins and gums are processed from the gummy secretions of certain tropical aromatic plants, among which myrrh (produced in East Africa and Arabia), frankincense (extracted from an olive family plant growing in Arabia), benzoin (products from Thailand and Sumatra are the most famous) and Tolu balsam (mainly produced in Colombia, South America) are all familiar to everyone. Many animal fragrances and resins and gums are "fixatives" in fragrance formulas, and some are also used in medicine. Synthetic fragrances are particularly noteworthy. Synthetic fragrances are fragrances made by chemically modifying non-fragrance substances (plant-based or mineral-based). With the progress of modern fragrance chemistry and the organic chemical industry, the development of synthetic fragrances has been extremely rapid and the prospects are very broad. Currently, many natural single fragrances can be synthesized artificially, and many varieties that are not available in natural fragrances have also been created through synthesis, such as artificial musk, artificial sandalwood, and so on. In recent years, the variety of synthetic fragrances has continued to increase, reaching hundreds of species, so it has also become a major source of fragrances.

Whether it is natural fragrance or synthetic fragrance, it is rarely used alone. It must go through the procedure of "fragrance blending" to combine multiple fragrances into a fragrance, which has higher practical value. There are also many types of fragrances, which can be divided into food fragrances, tobacco fragrances, soap fragrances, cosmetic fragrances, etc., according to their uses; they can also be divided into floral fragrances, fruity fragrances, fantasy fragrances, etc., according to their types. If you make a fragrance according to a known formula, you only need to choose certain raw materials and "prepare them as directed" according to a certain dosage; if you want to create new fragrance varieties, the fragrance blending staff needs to have certain training and experience, and requires a keen sense of smell and excellent memory, be good at imitation, and be full of imagination. After careful trial and consideration, can they create high-quality fragrances. Generally speaking, cosmetic fragrances and high-grade soap fragrances have higher requirements on raw materials and technology, while food fragrances and tobacco fragrances are relatively simpler. For example, Paris fragrance (fantasy type) and domestic white rose fragrance (floral type) require 26 kinds of raw materials, while domestic Sanhua type snowflake fragrance requires as many as 36 kinds. Food fragrances such as bayberry fragrance, orange fragrance, and lemon fragrance generally require about ten kinds of fragrance raw materials. High-grade fragrances generally have one or several fragrance raw materials as the "main fragrance agent," that is, the basic fragrance of the fragrance; some others are "auxiliary agents," whose role is to set off the fragrance of the main fragrance agent to make the fragrance have a special flavor; there are also some raw materials used as "fixatives," whose purpose is to prevent the rapid evaporation of the entire fragrance and make the various fragrance components in the fragrance evaporate evenly, thereby maintaining a certain fragrance.

        Fragrance is a Comprehensive Science

The source, variety, production technology, and application range of fragrances are so diverse, so it itself is a comprehensive science. For example, the selection and cultivation of fragrance plants involve botany and agronomy; the relationship between the harvesting season, time, and oil yield is related to plant physiology and biochemistry; and the skills of oil extraction, the separation, analysis, and utilization of essential oil components are inseparable from chemical technology, organic chemistry, and analytical chemistry; as for the preparation of fragrances, it requires a foundation in physics, chemistry, physiology, and psychology, and also requires a certain artistic accomplishment. The purpose of fragrance research is first to explore natural resources and make full use of them, in order to enrich the variety and increase the yield of fragrances; if the yield of natural varieties is insufficient or the price is too high, it can be synthesized in large quantities from simple mineral raw materials at a lower cost, and new fragrance varieties can also be created using synthetic methods based on natural products. The second is to further develop fragrance blending, so that fragrance blending workers can use their experience and artistic talents in the rich treasure house of fragrance raw materials and on a reliable scientific basis to continuously create new fragrance varieties to meet the growing needs of the people. The ultimate goal of fragrance research is to thoroughly understand the essence of fragrance, master the scientific principles of fragrance blending, and be able to create all fragrances at will.

        Rapidly Developing Fragrance Industry in Our Country

My country has a vast territory, and the geographical and climatic environment is very suitable for the growth of aromatic plants. It can be said to be a relatively ideal area for the development of the fragrance industry. Since the founding of the country eleven years ago, my country's aromatic industry has developed greatly. Since the Great Leap Forward, my country's aromatic industry has developed rapidly through mass movements. The development and growth of Huangyan Chemical Plant in Zhejiang Province from scratch is a typical example. Under the conditions of lack of funds, lack of manpower, and lack of technology, the factory worked hard, broke through numerous difficulties in one or two years, and developed into a fragrance factory with considerable scale. It can not only produce dozens of fragrance varieties, but also includes many export fragrances and synthetic fragrances such as violet ketone, coumarin, and vanillin, which cannot but be said to be a miracle that appeared in the Great Leap Forward.

According to the established development policy, my country's fragrance industry requires unified planning, comprehensive development, multiple operations, close cooperation, local materials, adaptation to local conditions, focusing on the development of natural fragrances, and at the same time developing synthetic fragrances in areas with conditions. In recent years, scientific research on fragrances has also been booming. The Perfume Room of the Food Research Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry is a comprehensive research center. In recent years, it has achieved certain results in the introduction, cultivation, and oil extraction technology of aromatic plants, the analysis and utilization of wild essential oils, important synthetic fragrances, and fragrance blending technology. Relevant units of the Academy of Sciences have successively carried out fragrance research, and fragrance factories with conditions have also invested considerable efforts in this area.

In order to complete the arduous tasks assigned by the Party and the State, at present, in terms of natural fragrances, it is necessary to increase the variety and yield, and improve the quality. In terms of synthetic fragrances, we must first start with the known precious varieties and comprehensively catch up with the advanced level. As for the improvement of fragrance blending technology, we should adopt the method of combining "nose" and scientific analysis in order to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. Although our aromatic resources are very rich, some important varieties still need to be imported from abroad. For the fragrance varieties imported from abroad, we should quickly master the cultivation and processing technology in order to put them into production. As for the domestic precious aromatic varieties, we should accelerate their development. While giving priority to the development of precious varieties, we should vigorously explore wild essential oils and select and utilize them through scientific research. With the development of my country's chemical industry, we should also gradually establish a synthetic fragrance industry based on the petroleum system and calcium carbide gas system, and enrich the existing synthetic fragrances based on the coal tar system. As for fragrance blending, the most important problem at present is to eliminate superstition, so that new forces can grow up as soon as possible; and quickly master the experience of old experts and combine it with new scientific methods.

    积极开展香料的科学研究工作
    中国科学院有机化学研究所副研究员　刘铸晋
    在人们的日常生活中，香料有它的特殊地位。我国人民在烹调时喜欢使用的八角、茴香、花椒，都是传统的调味香料；具有香草、杨梅、桔子、可可、奶油等等香味的食品和饮料，更是鲜美可口。由于许多香料具有杀菌、杀虫或其他生理作用，所以又可以直接作为药品，为人们所熟知的檀香与冬青油，就早经列入药典之内。在罐头食品工业或水果包装行业中，香料也是经常使用的防腐剂。在肥皂、牙膏等广大人民的日常必需品以及其他许多卫生制剂中，总是要用到大量的香料；甚至在油漆、皮革等工业中，香料也成了不可缺少的成分。香料的主要用途是在香精和化装品工业方面。在我们社会主义国家里，随着人民生活水平的不断提高，香料的消费量也在不断地增长。我国大跃进以来，香花布、香墨水等等新产品的出现，不但可以美化人民生活，而且在国际市场上也传为佳话。
    香料工业虽然是规模较小的一种轻工业，但是它的产值是不可忽视的。不但香精是价格昂贵的产品，就是许多天然植物“精油”也具有很高的经济价值。譬如，根据有关部门的统计，二点二吨山苍子油可换一部拖拉机，六公斤香拊子油可换一吨肥田粉，而三十七公斤柏木脑可换一吨钢板。一两攻瑰油或茉莉油的价格，比一两黄金还贵。玫瑰油之所以如此昂贵，一方面是由于本身品质的优越，同时也由于出油率较低，一般在万分之二、三之间。据估计，制取一公斤玫瑰油，大约需要玫瑰花二百万朵。花的栽培、采集、加工等等方面所需的人工很多。此外，玫瑰油在高温下容易变质，一般不用水蒸汽蒸馏法取油，而改用溶剂萃取法或油脂吸取法。前者要用大量的价值昂贵的萃取剂（石油醚），而后者则因工作细致繁琐，需要大量熟练的人工。这些因素都大大增加了玫瑰油的成本。我们知道，以拥有“玫瑰谷”著名的保加利亚，它的芳香工业在国民经济中占着重要的地位。我国香料工业的基础虽然比较薄弱，但经过近年来的发展，已为国家创造了不少财富。
          香料的品种和来源
    香料的品种很多，经常使用的也有好几百种。香料的来源很复杂，其中有的来自植物、动物，有的来自矿物（通过加工）；有的来自深山，有的来自大海。一般说来可以分为四类：植物精油、动物香料、树脂树胶（这些都属于天然香料）和人工合成香料。植物精油是从芳香植物的花、叶、茎、根、果实、种子、树皮等各个部位提取出来的挥发性油。精油的含量
  （出油率）多的可到百分之几十（例如丁香油），少的不过万分之几（例如玫瑰油）。植物精油品种繁多，已知的达一千多种。从这些成分复杂的精油中，还可以分离出许多“天然单体香料”，譬如从山苍子油中分离柠檬醛，从薄荷油中分离薄荷脑等，所以植物精油是当前最主要的香料来源之一。动物性香料中常用的有麝香（来自麝鹿，我国云南，四川，西北，东北各省都有出产）、灵猫香（来自灵猫，又称香猫，我国近来发现的九节狐狸也系这类品种）、龙涎香
  （是一种鲸鱼体内排出的腊状结石，小者重一、二公斤，大者达百余公斤）和海狸香（来自寒带的水栖动物海狸）等几种，都是比较名贵的香料。树脂树胶是从某些热带芳香植物的胶状分泌物加工而成，其中像没药（产于东非洲和阿拉伯）、乳香（从阿拉伯生长的一种橄榄科植物提取）、安息香（以泰国和苏门答腊的产品最为著名）和吐鲁香脂（主要产于南美洲的哥伦比亚）等，都是大家所熟悉的。动物香料和树脂树胶中有许多都是香精配方中的“定香剂”，有的也在医药中使用。值得特别注意的是合成香料。合成香料就是把非香料物质（植物性或矿物性的）用化学方法加以改造而成的香料。随着近代香料化学和有机化学工业的进展，合成香料的发展极为迅速，前景非常远大。目前许多天然单体香料都可以用人工方法合成，通过合成还创造了许多为天然香料所没有的品种，如人造麝香、人造檀香等等。近年来合成香料的品种不断增加，已达数百种之多，所以也成为香料的一项主要来源。
    无论是天然香料还是合成香料，一般都很少单独使用。必须经过“调香”的手续，将多种香料配合成为香精，才有更高的实用价值。香精的种类也不少，视其用途可以分为食品香精、烟草香精、皂用香精、化装香精等；视其类型又可分为花香型香精、果香型香精、幻想型香精等。如果按照已知的配方制造香精，只须选择一定的原料，按照一定的用量，“如法泡制”即可；如果要从事创造新的香精品种，则调香工作人员需有一定的训练与经验，要求具有敏锐的嗅觉和极好的记忆力，既要善于模仿，也要富于想像，经过细心的试探揣摩之后，才能创造品质优良的香精。一般说来，化装香精和高级皂用香精在原料和技术上的要求都比较高，而食用香精和烟草香精等则比较简单一些。如巴黎香精（幻想型）和国产白玫瑰香精（花香型）都需要二十六种原料，而国产三花型雪花香精则要多至三十六种。像杨梅香精、桔子香精、柠檬香精等食品香精所需用的香原料，一般都在十种上下。高级香精中一般有一种或几种香原料是“主香剂”，即该种香精的基本香味；另外一些是“辅助剂”，其作用是在衬托出主香剂的香调而使香精具有特殊的风韵；还有一些原料用作“定香剂”，其目的在防止整个香料的快速蒸发，并使香精中各种香料成分挥发均匀，从而维持一定的香味。
        香料是一门综合性科学
    香料的来源、品种、生产技术和应用范围既是如此多种多样，所以它本身就是一门综合性的科学。举例来说，香料植物的选种、栽培，要涉及植物学和农艺学；采集的季节、时间和出油率的关系，就与植物生理、生化有关；而出油的技巧，精油成分的分离、分析和利用，则离不开化学工艺、有机化学和分析化学；至于香精的配制，更需要有物理、化学、生理学和心理学等等学科的基础，还要求一定的艺术修养。香料研究的目的，首先在于发掘天然资源，并使之得到充分利用，借以丰富香料的品种及增加产量；如遇天然品种产量不足或价格太高，则可以从简单的矿物原料以较低的成本大量合成，还可以利用天然产品为线索，用合成方法创造新的香料品种。其次是要进一步发展调香学，使调香工作者能够在丰富的香原料宝库中和可靠的科学基础上，利用自己的经验和艺术才能，不断从事创造新的香精品种，以满足人民日益增长的需要。香料研究的最后目标是要彻底了解香味的本质，掌握调香的科学原理，从而能够随心所欲地创造一切香料。
        迅速发展中的我国香料事业
    我国幅员辽阔，地理和气候环境又很适宜于芳香植物的生长，可以说是发展香料事业比较理想的地区。建国十一年以来我国的芳香事业有了很大发展。大跃进以来，我国芳香事业更通过群众运动的方式迅速发展起来。浙江黄岩化工厂从无到有地发展壮大，就是一个典型的事例。该厂在缺乏资金、缺乏人力、缺乏技术的条件下，艰苦奋斗，在一、两年内突破重重困难，发展成为一个具有相当规模的香料厂，不但能够生产几十种香料品种，而且其中还包括紫罗兰酮、香豆素、香兰素等多种出口香料和合成香料，这不能不说是大跃进中出现的奇迹。
    我国的香料事业，按照既定的发展方针，要求作到统一规划，全面发展，多家经营，密切协作，就地取材，因地制宜，以发展天然香料为主，同时要在有条件的地区发展合成香料。近几年来，香料方面的科学研究也在蓬勃发展。轻工业部所属的食品研究所香料室是一个综合性的研究中心，几年来在芳香植物的引种、栽培和出油技术，野生精油的分析利用，重要的合成香料，以及调香技术等等方面的研究，都取得了一定的成绩。科学院的有关单位，均相继开展了香料研究，有条件的香料厂也在这方面投入了相当的力量。
    为了完成党和国家所交给的艰巨任务，目前，在天然香料方面，必须增加品种和产量，并提高质量。在合成香料方面，首先要从已知的名贵品种着手研究，全面赶上先进水平。至于调香技术的提高，应当采用“鼻头”与科学分析相结合的办法，以便作到多快好省。我们的芳香资源虽然很丰富，但有些重要品种，还需要从国外引进，对于从国外引进的香料品种应当迅速掌握栽培和加工技术，以便投入生产。至于国产的名贵芳香品种，尤应加速发展。在优先发展名贵品种的同时，要大力发掘野生精油，通过科学研究加以选择和利用。随着我国化学工业的发展，还应当逐步建立石油系统及电石气系统的合成香料工业，并充实已有的煤焦系统合成香料。至于调香方面，当前首要的问题是破除迷信，使新生力量尽快成长；并迅速掌握起老专家的经验，使之与新的科学方法相结合。
