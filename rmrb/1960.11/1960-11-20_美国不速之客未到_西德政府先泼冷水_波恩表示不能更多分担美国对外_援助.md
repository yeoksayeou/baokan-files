Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, November 18th: The Bonn government issued a press release today, on the eve of the arrival of U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Undersecretary of State Dillon, saying that West Germany's "aid" to emerging countries "exceeds the 'aid' of larger countries" to these countries.

This is undoubtedly pouring cold water on the uninvited American guests who are coming here to ask West Germany to contribute more money to share America's foreign "aid" and pay for NATO military expenses.

The press release recalled that West Germany's foreign economic "aid" has increased from 1.9 billion marks in 1957 to 2.5 billion marks last year. In the future, the funds used for this purpose annually will be between 3 billion marks and 4 billion marks. In addition, the press release also pointed out (obviously to the United States) that West Germany is repaying its foreign debt ahead of schedule.

The West German news agency DPA wrote on the 17th: "Here (Bonn) is awaiting the arrival of Anderson and Dillon with a complicated mix of concern, anxiety, and anticipation. 'Economic circles are skeptical about how the U.S.'s financial hopes can be satisfied.'"

DPA hinted that Bonn wanted to seize the opportunity of the United States asking it for money to blackmail it on issues such as accelerating armament. It wrote that during the talks, Bonn may also raise the issue of accelerating rearmament and reorganizing West German troops. It is expected that the issue of West German property frozen in the United States will also be raised.

    美国不速之客未到
    西德政府先泼冷水
    波恩表示不能更多分担美国对外“援助”
    新华社波恩18日电　波恩政府今天在美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙来到的前夕发表一个新闻公报，说什么西德对新兴国家的“援助”“比得过较大的国家”对这些国家的“援助”。
    这无疑是对到这里来要西德拿出更多钱来分担美国对外“援助”和支付北大西洋集团军费的美国不速之客先泼一盆冷水。
    新闻公报追述说，西德的对外经济“援助”已从1957年的十九亿马克提高到了去年的二十五亿马克。将来每年用于这一目的的资金将介于三十亿马克和四十亿马克之间。另外，新闻公报还指出（显然是对美国说的），西德是提前偿还外债的。
    西德通讯社德新社17日写道：“这里（波恩）正以关切、焦急和期待的错综复杂心情等待着”安德逊和狄龙的到来。“经济界人士对如何能满足美国的财经希望这一点抱有怀疑。”
    德新社暗示波恩要抓住美国要它出钱的机会在加速武装等问题上来敲诈。它写道，在会谈期间，波恩还可能提起加速重新武装和改组西德部队的问题。预料还会提出被冻结在美国的西德财产问题。
