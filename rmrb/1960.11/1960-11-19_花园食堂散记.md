    Random Notes from the Garden Cafeteria
    Xiao Jiyang, Ji'an, Jiangxi
    The work-ending bell of the Garden Brigade of the Zuolong Commune rang, and the commune members carried loads of grain back to the cafeteria. We saw all kinds of pictures and slogans posted on the wooden walls under the light, as well as a table for saving food. I read the table in a low voice. Old man Song Genmei heard me reading and quickly came over to interrupt: "Donggen is really good at planning. Everyone said that they wanted to eat well, eat their fill, and save a little. He thought of all kinds of ways. A few days ago, he cut the pumpkin into pieces, mixed it with rice to cook porridge, added some oil and a little salt, and it tasted fragrant and sweet."
    We asked, "Where's Donggen?" Just as we were talking, Donggen happened to arrive.
    Song Donggen carried a playful child on his shoulder and strode into the cafeteria. He was a man in his thirties, with a few smile lines often hanging on the corners of his mouth. You could tell at a glance that he had a good temper.
    During the summer harvest this year, the Party branch decided to appoint Donggen as a cook to help Song Dongsheng arrange the lives of the team members. As soon as he arrived at the cafeteria, he focused on building a family fortune and expanding vegetable cultivation. A total of more than twelve mu of vegetables were planted for the 116 people in the team, with as many as a dozen varieties. The cafeteria also raised seven pigs. With more vegetables, Donggen used his brains to adjust the diet. Cabbage was eaten in the morning, and radishes were eaten in the afternoon. There were two dishes for each meal, and sometimes a little chili was fried. The stove for cooking rice was not ventilated, and the smoke from the firewood was suffocating. He became a mason himself and improved the stove's chimney. The hanging water bucket was leaking, and he became a carpenter himself and repaired the bucket.
    But now, when we ask him, this Communist Party member who is praised by everyone seems unnatural: "That's all thanks to the good leadership of the Party. Our deputy secretary of the county party committee is stationed in our brigade, and he cares about our cafeteria! Once, I and a few old commune members in charge of vegetables were loosening the soil in the radish field. The deputy secretary walked down to the field and removed the old leaves from the radish seedlings, and told us as he removed them: 'Remove the old leaves, and the radishes will grow bigger.' He wanted us to manage all the vegetables well."
      "Which of the twelve cafeterias in the entire brigade is better run?" I interjected.
      "All are good, those eleven cafeterias are even better than ours!"
    Donggen then talked about the brigade's Party branch secretary. He described in a respectful and affectionate tone how their branch secretary personally took command, grasping production with one hand and life with the other. Now, the 1,100 people eating in the twelve cafeterias in this brigade have planted 415 mu of vegetables, an average of more than three-tenths of a mu per person. Each person can eat one and a half catties of fresh vegetables every day. Each cafeteria raises more than 100 pigs, more than 1,000 chickens and ducks, and more than 10,000 fish. With a family fortune, the cafeteria is getting better and better.
    Donggen told the story of the branch secretary personally going to the kitchen. It was one day not long ago when the branch secretary had just walked into the cafeteria when the cook, Aunt Song, hurriedly took his hand and said, "Secretary, it's really hard to be a cook." "What's the matter?" Aunt Song said, "In order to save food for everyone, we steamed the rice a little softer. Old man Song said: 'There is less rice, and it is not tasty in clumps.'" The branch secretary felt that this was a problem, and he decided to come to the cafeteria to find a way to allow the commune members to eat well, eat their fill, and eat sparingly. He immediately found the team leader to discuss it. The next day, they personally went to the kitchen to do it themselves. After asking about the past cooking methods, they decided to steam it a little harder, first scoop up the half-cooked rice and cool it in a large pan so that the rice grains would not clump together. After pouring the half-cooked rice into the steamer, increase the heat and steam it with high heat until it "steams up" without adding water or opening the lid in the middle. Coincidentally, on this day, the same 120-odd catties of rice steamed more than 30 catties more than in the past. The commune members said, "This rice is fragrant and sweet, not soft and not hard, unlike the past when it tasted watery." At this moment, the cooks also understood that it was just that their cooking methods were not right. In the past, they would scoop up the rice grains only after they had bloomed, and as a result, the small rice grains were all cooked to a pulp and sank in the rice soup. The rice soup became a paste, and naturally, there was less rice. The rice grains were not cooled when they were scooped up, and water was added in the middle of steaming, so the rice clumped together, and it became rotten and had no fragrance. After finding this reason, the Party branch promptly summarized the experience and introduced it to the cooks of the entire brigade.

    花园食堂散记
    江西吉安　萧纪洋
    佐龙公社花园大队的收工钟响了，社员们挑着一担担谷子，回食堂来。我们借着灯光看见木板墙上贴满了各种图画和标语，还有一张节约粮食的表，我小声地念着表。宋根美老头听到我在念，连忙走过来插话：“冬根真会划算，大家说要吃好、吃饱还要省一点，他就左想办法右想办法。前些日子他把南瓜切成块，拌米煮稀饭，再加些油，放点盐，吃起来又香又甜。”
    我们问：“冬根呢？”正说着，可巧冬根来了。
    宋冬根肩上扛个嬉闹的孩子，踏着大步走进食堂。他是个约莫三十来岁的人，嘴角上常挂着几丝笑纹，一看就知道他有个好脾气。
    今年夏收时，党支部就决定冬根当炊事员，协助宋冬生把小队社员的生活安排好。他一到食堂，就大抓建立家底子，扩种蔬菜，全小队一百一十六个人吃饭，一共种了十二亩多菜，足有十几种。食堂里还养了七头猪。菜多了，冬根开动脑筋调剂着吃，上午吃了白菜，下午就吃萝卜，每餐有两个菜，有时还炒点辣椒。煮饭的灶不通气，柴烟熏得满屋逼人，他便自己做泥水匠，把灶的烟囱改好；吊水桶漏水，他又自己做木匠，把吊桶修好。
    可是，现在我们问问他本人，这位为大家称赞的共产党员，便显得不自然起来了：“那全是党领导的好嘛。我们县委副书记常驻在我们大队，他可关心我们的食堂哩！有一次，我和几个管菜的老社员在萝卜田里松土，副书记走下田动手给萝卜苗摘除老叶，边摘边告诉我们说：‘摘了老叶，萝卜才长得大。’他要我们管好一切蔬菜。”
      “全大队十二个食堂哪个办得更好？”我插问了一句。
      “都好，那十一个食堂比我们还要好哩！”
    冬根又说起大队的支部书记。他用又敬爱又亲切的口气叙述着他们的支部书记怎样亲自挂帅，一手抓生产，一手抓生活。现在，这个大队十二个食堂一千一百多人吃饭，已经种了四百一十五亩蔬菜，每人平均三分多，每人每天能吃到一斤半新鲜蔬菜，各个食堂养了一百多头猪，一千多只鸡鸭，一万多尾鱼。有了家底子，食堂就越办越好了。
    冬根讲到支部书记亲自下厨房的故事。那是不久前的一天，支部书记刚走进食堂，炊事员宋大娘忙拉着他的手说：“支书，炊事员真难当。”“什么事？”宋大娘说：“我们为了给大家节约粮食，把饭蒸得软了点。宋老头说：‘饭少了，又是一团团不好吃。’”支部书记觉得这是个问题，他决定自己来食堂想办法让社员们既要吃得好，又要吃得饱、吃得省。当场便找到小队长一起商量。第二天他们亲自下厨房动手，问明过去煮饭的方法后，就决定稍微蒸硬一点，先把半熟的米捞起来放在大团盘里凉一凉，这样，饭粒才不会结团。把半熟的米倒到甑里后，加大火力，一直是大火蒸到“上汽”，中途不加水，也不揭盖。真巧，这一天，同样一百二十多斤米，却比过去多蒸出了三十多斤饭。社员说：“这种饭又香又甜，不软不硬，不像过去吃起来水渍渍的。”这一下炊事员也想通了，只怪自己煮饭的方法不对头。过去，她们把米粒煮得开了花才捞起来，结果小米粒都煮烂了，沉在米汤里，米汤成了糊糊，饭自然就少了；米粒捞起来又不凉一凉，蒸到中途又掺了水，饭就结成了团团，也就又烂又没有香味了。找到了这个原因，党支部就及时总结出经验，介绍给全大队的炊事员。
