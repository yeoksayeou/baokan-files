Meeting means to get together and discuss matters.

Going down to the grassroots level, you often hear grassroots cadres saying to each other when parting, "Let's meet at such and such a time, at such and such a place." That means, let's discuss it. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "'Exchanging information' means that the committee members of the Party committee should notify each other and exchange information about what they know." In grassroots work, meeting is a good way to exchange information.

Meeting is a working method created by grassroots cadres in practical work based on their personal experiences. Two people can meet, three people can meet even better, and of course, more people can meet. It's not like a meeting, where two people can't hold a meeting, but two people can meet. The meeting time is long if there is something to say, and short if there is nothing to say. It can be ten minutes, eight minutes, or longer, or shorter. The focus of the meeting is clear, one issue, or two issues, and after the meeting, they part ways and do their own things, without dragging their feet. The venue for the meeting can be in the fields or in the workshop; the time for the meeting can be early in the morning when going to the fields, or after work in the evening, very flexible. It is settled with a word, unlike holding a meeting, which must have a venue and an agenda. There are many, many more benefits of meeting...

Meeting, from the meaning of the word, also contains a profound meaning. When flint collides with a fire striker, it sparks. There are many contradictions in things, and to resolve these contradictions, they must also meet. Meeting is a method of resolving contradictions. Grassroots cadres go deep into various points, discover contradictions in things, and also bring back the ideas of the masses. When two or three people meet, it sparks the fire of wisdom, illuminating the path to resolving contradictions. Of course, one person can also resolve contradictions. However, that is only one person, without more concentrated research on all aspects of the contradiction, it may not be resolved well, or resolved one-sidedly. "A fence needs three stakes, a hero needs three helpers." When the policy and thinking are clear, the working method is also very important. The vast number of grassroots cadres have created the method of meeting in their own practice, which is very reasonable.

Since the implementation of the "two-five system," meetings in grassroots work have been greatly reduced, which is naturally a good thing. However, it must also be seen that in a production team, in a workshop, there are many cadres; in a branch, there are many branch committee members. They are scattered into various production groups to participate in production, lead production, and discover problems in a timely manner. Some of these problems can be solved immediately, such as weeding not being clean, fertilization not being even, products not meeting specifications, and so on. However, there are also some problems that cannot be solved immediately. Those problems that cannot be solved at that time need to be met in a timely manner, and several people should study and solve them together. And those problems that have already been solved at that time can also be reflected as a situation, as a reference, to attract everyone's attention. If we have to wait until the day of a meeting every seven days or so, then the problems will accumulate, the content of the meeting will swell, like a basket of problems, unable to concentrate on solving the main problems, and reducing the quality of the meeting. Therefore, we must have meetings to reduce the burden of meetings and supplement the shortcomings of meetings.

In grassroots work, this kind of meeting is indispensable. In a production team, the branch secretary, deputy secretary, and production team leader can be the center, and meet with various production groups by area; then they meet among themselves when they come back. The production team leaders of adjacent production groups can also meet each other. After this kind of meeting, it is like a net, connecting all aspects of the work, forming a whole, driving the work forward, and there will be great gains.

    碰

    碰，是碰头议事。
    走到基层去，常会听到基层干部在临分手的时候，互相关照说，在什么时候，什么地点，我们碰碰头。那意思就是，商量商量。毛泽东同志说：“‘互通情报’，就是说，党委各委员之间要把彼此知道的情况互相通知，互相交流。”在基层工作中，碰，就是互通情报的一种好办法。
    碰，是基层干部在实际工作中，根据亲身体会创造出来的工作方法。两个人就可以碰，三个人就更可以碰，当然，还可以多几个人。它不像会议，两个人就不能开会，而两个人却可以碰头。碰的时间，有话则长，无话则短，可以十分钟，可以八分钟，也可以再长些，也可以再短些。碰的中心明确，一个问题，或是两个问题，碰完就两下分手，各干各的去，不拖泥带水。碰的场合，可以阡陌之上，也可以车间之内；碰的时间，可以清早上田时，也可以晚上收工后，非常灵活，一言为定，不像开个会，一定要有个会场，有个议程。碰的好处，还有很多很多……
    碰，从字义上来讲，却也寓有一番深意。燧石同火刀相碰，便发出火花。事物中存在诸多矛盾，要解决这些矛盾，也必须使它们碰头会面。碰，就是解决矛盾的方法。基层干部深入到各个点里去，发现了事物中的矛盾，也带回了群众的主意。两个人或三个人一碰，便发出了智慧的火花，照亮了解决矛盾的途径。当然，一个人也可以解决矛盾。但是，那毕竟是一个人，没有更多地集中研究矛盾的各个方面，就可能解决得不好，解决得片面。“一道篱笆三根桩，一个好汉三个帮。”政策思想明确了，工作方法也很重要。广大基层干部在亲身的实践中创造了碰的方法，是很有道理的。
    实行“二五制”以来，基层工作中的会议大大减少了，这自然是件好事。但是，也要看到，在一个生产队里，在一个车间里，有许多干部；在一个支部里，有许多支委。他们分散到生产的各个小组里去参加生产，领导生产，及时发现了问题。这些问题，有的是他们可以马上解决的，比如锄草锄不干净，施肥没有施匀，产品不合规格，等等。但是，也有些问题，不是马上可以解决的。那些当时不能解决的问题，就需要及时碰碰头，几个人一起研究研究，加以解决。而那些当时已经解决了的问题，也可以当作一种情况，反映出来，作为借鉴，引起大家注意。如果一定要等到七天或多少天开一次会议的日子，那又会使问题堆积起来，会议内容膨胀起来，像个问题篓子，不能集中力量解决主要问题，降低了会议的质量。所以，就得有碰头来减轻会议的负担，又补充会议之不足。
    在基层工作中，这种碰是不可少的。在一个生产队里，可以支部书记、副书记、生产队长为中心，同各生产小组分片碰头；回来他们之间再碰头。各邻近的生产小组长，也可以互相碰头。经过这种碰头，就如同一个网一样，把工作的各个环节连结起来，形成一个整体，带动工作前进，一定大有收获。
