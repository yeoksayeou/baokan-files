Xinhua News Agency report: The Party branch of the Yang Hong Production Team of the Mu Yang Brigade of the Jia He Commune in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, is skilled in leading production. In leading production, they adhere to the mass line, plant crops according to local conditions, and promote advanced technologies, enabling the team's actual output to exceed contracted output year after year, transforming from a grain-deficient team to a grain-surplus team. They have received overproduction rewards from the brigade for consecutive years, and the income of the commune members has also increased year after year. In the past two years, the team has also increased its draft animals by three head, rubber-tired carts by nine, and the number of pigs from 80 in 1958 to 213.

The Yang Hong Production Team was originally a poor team with very bad soil. The team's 502 mu of land consisted of five types: one was silt from the Yellow River灘, accounting for 90 mu; two was light sandy soil, 220 mu; three was white sandy soil, 100 mu; four was clay soil, accounting for 20 mu; and five was shifting sand, 72 mu. The complex soil types brought certain difficulties to production. To this end, the Party branch first summarized the planting experience of previous years, classifying the soil properties of the team and which soil was suitable for planting which crops. The conclusion was: the Yellow River滩 silt is suitable for planting one season of wheat; light sandy soil is suitable for planting sweet potatoes, wheat, corn, and soybeans; white sandy soil is suitable for planting soybeans and cotton; clay soil is suitable for planting millet, sorghum, and wheat; and shifting sand is suitable for planting soybeans and peanuts. Based on research and classification, the Party branch, under the premise of taking grain as the key link and making unified arrangements for grain, cotton, and oil, appropriately expanded the planting area of sweet potatoes and increased the planting of various high-yield crops suitable for the soil.

In addition to arranging crop planting plans, the team also adhered to the mass line in promoting advanced agricultural technologies from other places, adopting a form of combining leading cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians, implementing everything after experiments and then gradually promoting it. This achieved the goal of adapting the promotion of advanced experiences and technologies to local conditions. For example, when promoting dense planting of sweet potatoes, the leadership required 4,000 to 6,000 plants per mu, while the local practice was "old two thousand" (plants). Commune members believed that sparse planting resulted in large blocks, while dense planting did not increase production. Cadres led by branch secretary Liu Meizhu formed a seven-person experimental group with technicians and experienced farmers, personally planting two mu of sweet potatoes, one mu with 3,000 plants and one mu with 6,000 plants. With the same soil quality and the same processing and fertilization, the sweet potatoes were inspected and weighed with the commune members on the spot when they were dug up. The result: although the 3,000-plant plot had larger blocks, it only yielded 2,800 jin per mu; while the 6,000-plant plot, although the blocks were smaller, actually yielded 4,500 jin per mu. This fact educated the commune members, and as a result, all the sweet potatoes planted by the team last year met the specifications for reasonable dense planting. When promoting advanced experiences such as intercropping and relay cropping, the Party branch also adopted this approach. Therefore, the area of intercropping and relay cropping in the team expanded from 40 mu in 1958 to 246 mu this year, which effectively tapped the potential of the land and increased the yield per unit area.

Because the Party branch adhered to the mass line in leading production, it greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the commune members, prompting them to actively care about the team's production and offer suggestions and find ways to increase production for the team. This spring, the brigade called for planting spring soybeans during "Grain Rain." Branch secretary Liu Meizhu asked experienced farmers for "advice." Experienced farmers such as Yang Hougang believed that there were many spring winds, and light sandy soil could be planted earlier, but flying sand and white sandy soil would be blown to death by the wind and sand if planted earlier. It was best to plant them after "Start of Summer" to ensure a good harvest. The team leadership listened to their opinions and only planted ten mu of light sandy soil in advance, and postponed planting twenty mu of white sandy soil until "Start of Summer." As a result, not a single mu of soybeans in this team was damaged by wind and sand disasters.

    看地种田　连年增产
    杨红小队坚持群众路线生产发展很快
    据新华社讯　山东寿张县夹河公社穆杨大队杨红生产小队党支部，领导生产有方，在领导生产中坚持走群众路线，因地制宜种植作物和推广先进技术，使小队的实产连年超过包产，由缺粮变成余粮；连年受到大队的超产奖励，社员收入也连年增加。全队两年来还增加耕畜三头，胶轮车九辆，生猪由1958年的八十头增加到二百一十三头。
    杨红生产小队原是土质很坏的穷队。全队五百零二亩土地有五种类型：一为黄河滩淤地，占九十亩；二为轻沙地，二百二十亩；三为白沙地，一百亩；四为粘土地，占二十亩；五为飞沙地，七十二亩。土质复杂，给生产带来了一定困难。为此，党支部首先总结了历年种植经验，将本队的土地性质，和什么土壤适于种植哪种农作物，作了排队分类，得出的结论是：河滩淤地适合种一季麦子，轻沙地适合种地瓜、小麦、玉米、大豆；白沙地适合种大豆、棉花；粘土地适合种谷子、高粱、小麦；飞沙地适合种大豆、花生。根据研究排队，党支部在以粮为纲，粮棉油统一安排的前提下，适当地扩大了地瓜（甘薯）种植面积，增种各种土壤所适宜的高产作物。
    除了安排作物的种植计划外，在推广外地的先进农业技术中，这个队也坚持了走群众路线，采取领导干部、老农和技术员三结合的形式，一切经过试验后再逐步推广。作到了推广先进经验和技术因地制宜。如推广地瓜密植时，领导上要求每亩达到四千棵至六千棵，而当地是“老两千”（棵），社员认为稀植结大块，密植不增产。以支部书记刘美珠为首的干部就和技术员、老农组成了七个人的试验小组，亲自种植了二亩地瓜，一亩种三千棵，一亩种六千棵，同样土质，同样加工施肥，刨地瓜时和社员当场验收过秤。结果：三千棵的虽然块大，每亩只收了二千八百斤；而六千棵的虽然块小，但每亩实收四千五百斤。事实教育了社员，结果去年全队种植的地瓜全部达到合理密植的规格要求。在推广间作、套种等先进经验时，党支部也采取了这种作法，因此，全队间作套种的面积，由1958年的四十亩，扩大到今年的二百四十六亩，这就有效地发挥了土地的潜力，提高了单位面积产量。
    由于党支部在领导生产中坚持走群众路线，大大地调动了社员的积极性，使他们主动地关心本队生产，给队里出主意、找增产门路。今年春季，大队号召“谷雨”种春大豆，支部书记刘美珠就请老农作“参谋”，老农杨厚刚等认为春风多，轻沙地早种点可以，飞沙地和白沙地早种了会被风沙刮死，最好是在“立夏”以后再种，才能保收。小队领导上听取了他们的意见，只把十亩轻沙地提前种上，二十亩白沙地推迟到“立夏”才种。结果，这个小队没有一亩大豆因风沙灾害而遭到损失。
