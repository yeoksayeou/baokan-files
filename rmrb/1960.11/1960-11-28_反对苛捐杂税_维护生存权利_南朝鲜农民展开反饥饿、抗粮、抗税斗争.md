Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th: Seoul News: South Korean farmers, struggling in poverty and hunger, have launched anti-hunger, anti-grain, and anti-tax struggles against the Chang Myon puppet authorities in order to fight for their right to survival.

According to a report by the South Korean Tonghwa News Agency, on the 24th, more than 200 impoverished farmers from Incheon City demonstrated in front of the puppet "Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry" and the puppet "Public Health and Social Affairs Office" in Seoul, demanding that the puppet "government" distribute relief grain and land reclamation funds. These farmers specifically demanded that the puppet authorities hand over 200,000 pyong (200 pyong equals 1 mu) of "state-owned wasteland" in the suburbs of Incheon City to them for cultivation without compensation, and provide each farmer with 120,000 hwan in land reclamation funds without compensation.

The report stated that the farmers also pointed out during the demonstration that there are two million landless farmers in South Korea today, who need relief and need to cultivate one million chobu (one chobu equals fifteen mu) of land. This is also the urgent desire of all impoverished farmers.

According to a broadcast by Daejeon Radio Station, farmers in various parts of South Chungcheong Province continue to launch struggles to resist the puppet authorities' plundering of autumn grain. According to reports, South Chungcheong Province suffered from floods and droughts this year, and agricultural production has greatly decreased, but the puppet authorities are still plundering the little bit of grain that farmers can get their hands on under many guises such as "land income tax," "land price repayment grain," and "contribution grain." However, due to the farmers' resistance, from November 1st to 15th, the grain plundered by the puppet authorities was only 3% of their original plan. In particular, farmers in nine of the fifteen cities and counties in the province and in Daejeon City "did not hand over any autumn grain at all."

According to the *Jeonnam Daily* newspaper, more than 100 farmers in Yongsan-ri, Deokjin-myeon, Yeongam-gun, South Jeolla Province, opposed the puppet authorities' exploitation of farmers' blood and sweat under the name of "paying water tax." They recently jointly submitted a protest letter to the puppet authorities, strongly demanding the immediate revision of unreasonable taxes.

    反对苛捐杂税　维护生存权利
    南朝鲜农民展开反饥饿、抗粮、抗税斗争
    新华社平壤26日电　汉城消息：在贫困和饥饿中挣扎的南朝鲜农民，为争取生存权利向张勉傀儡当局展开了反饥饿、抗粮、抗税等斗争。
    据南朝鲜同和通讯社报道，24日，仁川市二百多名贫苦农民到汉城伪“农林部”和伪“保健社会部办公厅”门前举行示威，要求傀儡
  “政府”发放救济粮和开荒资金。这些农民特别要求傀儡当局把仁川市郊区的二十万坪（二百坪合一市亩）“官有荒地”无代价地交给他们开垦耕种，并且无代价地发给每户农民十二万圜开荒资金。
    报道说，这些农民在示威中还指出：今天南朝鲜有二百万失去土地的农民，他们需要救济，需要开垦一百万町步（一町步合十五市亩）土地。这也是所有贫苦农民的迫切愿望。
    另据大田广播电台广播，忠清南道各地农民继续展开斗争，反抗傀儡当局掠夺秋粮。据报道，忠清南道今年遭受水灾、旱灾，农业大大减产，但傀儡当局仍然以“土地所得税”、“土地代价偿还粮”和“交纳粮”等许多名目掠夺农民仅能拿到手的一点点粮食。但是在农民反抗下，从11月1日起到15日为止，傀儡当局所掠夺到的粮食仅不过为他们原计划的3％。特别是道内十五个市、郡中的九个市、郡和大田市的农民，“连一个人也没有拿出秋粮”。
    另据《全南日报》报道，全罗南道灵岩郡德津面龙山里的一百多名农民，反对傀儡当局以“交纳水税”为名剥削农民的血汗。他们最近联名向傀儡当局提出抗议书，强硬要求立即修改不合理的税收。
