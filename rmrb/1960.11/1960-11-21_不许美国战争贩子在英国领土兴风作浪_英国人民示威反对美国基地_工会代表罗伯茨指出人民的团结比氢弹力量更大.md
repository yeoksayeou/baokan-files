Xinhua News Agency, London, November 19th: Demonstrations were held simultaneously in Glasgow and London this afternoon. Shouts against "Polaris" missile submarine bases and for the closure of all American bases resounded through the two cities.

	Five thousand people participated in the Glasgow demonstration. Holy Loch, the intended site for the "Polaris" missile submarine base, is only thirty miles from the city.

	Some people traveled from hundreds of miles away to participate in the demonstration. The line of demonstrators stretched for more than a mile. Traffic came to a complete standstill for an hour as the demonstrators passed through the city's main commercial district. Many women participated in the demonstration, carrying their children or pushing them in strollers.

	The placards held aloft by the demonstrators were like a forest, bearing slogans such as "Don't Let Americans Stir Up Trouble in Holy Loch, Scotland." They attracted the attention of thousands of sympathetic onlookers.

	The demonstration ended with a mass meeting, which passed a resolution to be submitted to the British Prime Minister opposing the "Polaris" missile submarine base, to thunderous applause. The resolution stated that the citizens of Scotland most strongly condemned the American government's establishment of such a base in Holy Loch and demanded that the government rescind this decision. The resolution said, "We pledge to continue our efforts until our demand is realized."

	In London, more than three thousand residents braved the cold to march to the American Embassy to express their opposition to the establishment of a "Polaris" missile submarine base and other American bases in Britain.

	The demonstrators (including Communists, trade union members, veterans, and housewives) chanted "Ban the Bomb and Get Rid of the Yanks" along the way. Their placards bore slogans such as "Close All American Bases Here" and "Yanks, Take Your Rockets Home."

	A delegation representing more than 250,000 people handed a letter of protest to an official at the American Embassy.

	At a mass meeting held in Trafalgar Square before the march, Vic Pagram, Secretary of the British Veterans for Peace movement, demanded that the Americans not only leave Holy Loch but also the territory of Britain.

	Ernie Roberts, representing the Amalgamated Engineering Union's one million machine-building workers, said, "We have a greater power than the hydrogen bomb, and our power is the organization and unity of trade unions and the people."

	Elliott, a representative of the Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, also spoke at the meeting.

	The meeting sent a letter to the people of Clydeside (the intended site of the American missile submarine base), paying tribute to their courageous struggle against the establishment of the base.

    不许美国战争贩子在英国领土兴风作浪
    英国人民示威反对美国基地
    工会代表罗伯茨指出人民的团结比氢弹力量更大
    新华社伦敦19日电　今天下午在格拉斯哥和伦敦同时举行了示威。不要“北极星”式导弹潜艇基地并封闭一切美国基地的吼声响彻了这两个城市。
    格拉斯哥的示威有五千人参加。预定要建立“北极星”式导弹潜艇基地的荷利湾离这个城市只有三十英里。
    有些人是从几百英里外赶来参加示威的。示威者的行列长达一英里以上。当示威者通过这个城市的主要商业区的时候，交通完全停顿了一小时。许多妇女抱着或者用小车推着她们的孩子参加示威。
    示威者高举的标语牌像树林一样，上面写着“不许美国人在苏格兰荷利湾兴风作浪”等等的语句。他们吸引了几千个同情的观众的注意。
    示威结束时举行了群众大会，在雷鸣般的赞同声中通过了将向英国首相提出的反对“北极星”式导弹潜艇基地的决议。决议表示，苏格兰公民最强烈地谴责让美国政府在荷利湾建立这种基地，并且要求政府收回这种决定。决议说，“我们誓必继续努力，直到实现我们的这种要求为止。”
    在伦敦，三千多居民冒着寒冷游行到美国大使馆前，表示反对建立“北极星”式导弹潜艇基地以及美国在英国的其他基地。
    示威者（其中有共产党员、工会会员、退伍军人和家庭主妇）一路高呼“禁止核弹和驱除美国佬”。他们的标语牌上写的口号有：“关闭这里所有的美国基地”，“美国佬，把你们的火箭带回去”等等。
    一个代表二十五万多人的代表团交给美国大使馆一个官员一封抗议信。
    在游行前在特拉法加广场举行的群众大会上，英国退伍军人保卫和平运动书记维克·佩格兰要求美国人不但必须撤离荷利湾，而且必须撤离英国国土。
    厄尼·罗伯茨代表混合机械工业工会的一百万机器制造工人说，“我们比氢弹有更大的力量，我们的力量就是工会和人民的组织和团结。”
    青年拥护和平运动的代表伊利奥特也在大会上讲了话。
    大会向克莱得塞德（预定建立美国导弹潜艇基地的地方）的人民发出一封信，向他们反对建立基地的英勇斗争致敬。
