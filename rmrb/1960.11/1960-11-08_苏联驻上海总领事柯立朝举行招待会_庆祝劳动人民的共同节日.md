Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 7th. Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Kolichaev, held a reception this evening to celebrate the 43rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

    Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Shanghai, Chen Pixian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, Liu Shuzhou, Song Jiwen, and Zhao Zukang, Deputy Mayors of Shanghai, Chen Wangdao, Hu Juewen, Shen Tilan, and Liu Jingji, Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Shi Ximin, President of the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Zhong Min and Feng Depei, Vice Presidents, Wang Bicheng, Gao Zhirong, and Jiang Tengjiao, leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, attended the reception.

    Also present at the reception were responsible persons from various departments of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, local organizations of various democratic parties in Shanghai, leaders of various people's organizations, and prominent figures from all walks of life. Consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai also attended the reception.

    Consul General Kolichaev spoke at the reception. He said: Today, the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union and the working people of the world are celebrating the 43rd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era for mankind, a new era of the collapse of capitalism and the victory of socialism. Over the past 43 years, the Soviet state has achieved unprecedented prosperity and strength. Today, the Soviet Union ranks second in the world in terms of economic production level, surpassing the most economically developed United States in the capitalist world, not only in terms of speed, but also in terms of the absolute amount of annual product growth.

    Kolichaev said: The emergence of the socialist camp with a population of over one billion (including more than 600 million brothers in the People's Republic of China), and the nearly 1.5 billion people who have shaken off the shackles of colonial slavery, these facts particularly powerfully illustrate the great significance of the October Socialist Revolution in promoting human progress.

    Kolichaev said: The unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is a powerful factor in the continuous consolidation of the world socialist system and the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp. Loyalty to the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism has forever forged our two peoples into an unbreakable fraternal alliance. He said: There is no and will be no force in the world that can shake our friendship and the fraternal unity of the countries of the socialist camp.

    Ke Qingshi spoke at the meeting. He said that the great October Socialist Revolution was a victory for Marxism-Leninism and a fundamental turning point in the development of human history.

    After listing the achievements of the Soviet people in socialist and communist construction in his speech, Ke Qingshi said that the Chinese people have always regarded the achievements of the Soviet people as their own and are delighted and encouraged by them.

    Ke Qingshi said: We are facing an excellent situation in the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism. The strength of the socialist camp and the strength of the world's people against war far exceed the strength of imperialism. However, imperialism, headed by US imperialism, will never be reconciled to failure. They are struggling and counterattacking, and the danger of a new world war still exists. Therefore, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance. We firmly believe that as long as the people of the world further unite and form the broadest international united front against the aggressive forces of imperialism headed by the United States, and wage unremitting struggles, they will surely be able to stop imperialism from launching a new world war and defend world peace.

    Ke Qingshi pointed out: the great unity between China and the Soviet Union, and the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. This great unity is the most important guarantee for defending world peace and is in the fundamental interests of the working people of the world. He said: No matter what the circumstances, the people of China and the Soviet Union will always stand together. Let us hold high the banner of the October Revolution, the banner of invincible Marxism-Leninism, and forge ahead bravely.

    苏联驻上海总领事柯立朝举行招待会
    庆祝劳动人民的共同节日
    据新华社上海7日电　苏联驻上海总领事柯立朝为庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十三周年，在今天晚上举行招待会。
    中共上海市委第一书记、上海市市长柯庆施，中共上海市委书记处书记陈丕显，中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市副市长曹荻秋，上海市副市长刘述周、宋季文、赵祖康，政协上海市委员会副主席陈望道、胡厥文、沈体兰、刘靖基，上海市中苏友好协会会长石西民，副会长钟民、冯德培，中国人民解放军驻上海部队首长王必成、高志荣、江腾蛟等出席了招待会。
    出席招待会的还有上海市人民委员会各部门、各民主党派上海地方组织、各人民团体的负责人以及各界著名人士。各国驻上海领事也出席了招待会。
    柯立朝总领事在招待会上讲话。他说：今天苏联各族人民和全世界劳动人民都在庆祝开辟人类新纪元的十月社会主义革命四十三周年，这个新纪元是资本主义崩溃和社会主义胜利的新纪元。四十三年来苏维埃国家达到了空前的繁荣和强盛，今天苏联在经济生产水平方面已占世界第二位，不仅在速度方面，而且在产品的每年增长的绝对数量方面都已经超过了资本主义世界经济上最发达的美国。
    柯立朝说：拥有十亿以上人口（其中包括六亿多中华人民共和国的兄弟）的社会主义阵营的出现，和将近十五亿人口摆脱了殖民主义奴役的枷锁，这些事实特别有力地使人感到十月社会主义革命对于推动人类进步的伟大意义。
    柯立朝说：中苏两国人民间的牢不可破的友谊是世界社会主义体系和社会主义阵营的坚如磐石般的团结不断得到巩固的强大因素。对马克思列宁主义不朽思想的忠诚，使我们两国人民永远地结成了牢不可破的兄弟同盟。他说：世界上没有、也不会有任何力量能够动摇我们的友谊和社会主义阵营各国的兄弟般的团结。
    柯庆施在会上讲了话。他说，伟大的十月社会主义革命是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是人类历史发展的根本转折点。
    柯庆施在讲话中列举了苏联人民在社会主义、共产主义建设中的成就以后说，中国人民一向把苏联人民的成就看作是自己的成就，并为此感到欢欣鼓舞。
    柯庆施说：我们正面临着全世界人民反对帝国主义斗争的大好形势。社会主义阵营的力量，世界人民反对战争的力量大大超过了帝国主义的力量。但是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，决不会甘心失败，它们正在进行挣扎和反扑，新的世界战争危险仍然存在。因此，我们必须保持高度的警惕。我们坚信，只要全世界人民进一步团结起来，结成反对以美国为首的帝国主义侵略势力的最广泛的国际统一战线，进行坚持不懈的斗争，就一定能够制止帝国主义发动新的世界战争，保卫着世界和平。
    柯庆施指出：中苏两国的伟大团结，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的。这种伟大团结，是保卫世界和平最重要的保证，是全世界劳动人民的根本利益所在。他说：不论在什么情况下，中苏两国人民将永远站在一起。让我们高举十月革命的旗帜，战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的旗帜，奋勇前进。
