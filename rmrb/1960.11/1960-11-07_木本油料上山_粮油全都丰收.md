Woody Oil-Bearing Plants Go Uphill, Grain and Oil Crops All Reap a Bumper Harvest
Wang Jie, First Secretary of the Shangluo Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shaanxi

    In order to vigorously implement the Party Central Committee's policy of "the whole party mobilizing, the whole people mobilizing, making great efforts in agriculture, and making great efforts in grain production," the Shangluo Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on summarizing past experiences, put forward several specific measures. One of these is to move woody oil-bearing plants uphill, freeing up cultivated land for grain.

    Since 1957, the Shangluo area has achieved certain successes in planting various woody oil-bearing plants, mainly walnuts. Through this activity, it not only provided conditions for changing the "poor and blank" face of the entire area, but also enabled people to further strengthen their confidence in "man can conquer nature," "everything depends on human effort," and the ability to change poverty in the process of fighting against nature, and to develop the proletarian revolutionary spirit of working harder the poorer we are, and working harder the more difficult it is. However, in the early stages of our leadership of this movement, due to insufficient experience, incomplete planning, and the limitations of the small scale of advanced cooperatives, some places concentrated the planting of various woody oil-bearing plants, mainly walnuts, on cultivated land for grain, and even moved wild woody oil-bearing plants from the mountains, which led to a contradiction between oil and grain for land.

    The natural characteristics of the Shangluo area are: large mountains and deep gullies, vast area, little arable land, frequent natural disasters, and unstable grain production. Therefore, not only should we not occupy cultivated land for the development of woody oil-bearing plants, but we must also find ways to expand the arable land area, transform low-yield land into high-yield land, and increase grain production as soon as possible. Given the shortage of land, how can we grasp both grain and oil? There is only one way, and that is to move woody oil-bearing plants uphill.

    The birth of the People's Commune has opened up a broad path for resolving the contradiction between oil and grain for land. The Shangluo Prefectural Committee took advantage of this great opportunity to, on the one hand, instruct various localities to comprehensively plan and rationally arrange, based on the superiority of the Commune's "large scale and high degree of public ownership" and the wishes of the broad masses, and to combine afforestation with mountain management, afforestation with agriculture, and afforestation with grazing, in order to rapidly promote the movement of planting woody oil-bearing plants uphill; on the other hand, through surveys and interviews, we obtained methods from the masses to thoroughly resolve the contradiction between oil and grain for land. This is: First, combine tree planting with soil and water conservation. That is, through digging fish-scale pits and contour trenches, intercepting floods and storing water, accumulating soil and fertilizer, and transplanting or planting woody oil-bearing plants on the mountainside and barren hills. In this way, as the planting area and soil and water conservation projects gradually expand, controlling soil erosion, we can, on the one hand, gradually turn barren hills and slopes into arable land for growing crops; on the other hand, stabilize the riverbeds year by year, and also make full use of the river滩地 (river flats). The Longwangmiao Management Area of Shang County, for example, has planted crops on more than 1,700 mu of barren hills and slopes and restored 45 mu of river滩地 over the past three years through this method. Second, plant rationally and match planting according to local conditions and trees. For example, shrubs such as tung oil trees and oil tea trees have small branches and little coverage. From planting to becoming a forest, both intercropping and interplanting can be carried out, and planting can be carried out from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain; those currently planted on gentle slopes or plains can be improved through soil and water conservation and oil-grain intercropping, transforming wasteland into cultivated land. In this way, woody oil-bearing plants are stepped up, and through returning forest to agriculture, cultivated land is freed up for grain crops every year. For example, in the understory of established trees (such as lacquer seeds, walnuts, etc.), choose shade-loving and moist shrubs (such as white milk trees, etc.) for intercropping, and then plant shade-loving and moist alfalfa, medicinal materials, and other crops under the shrub oil-bearing forest. The result of such rational allocation according to local conditions and trees can also solve the land competition contradiction between oil crops and grain, and between oil crops and pasture. For example, the Sidipu Production Team of the Wuguan Commune in Shangnan County has two mu of oak (tree) forest, under which grows an established white milk tree forest, under which grow small white milk trees and alfalfa, etc. All three layers grow very vigorously. The white milk tree seeds alone harvested nearly 100 jin this year, and seedlings can also be transplanted to more than 100 mu of land. Some also adopt tall tree forests interplanted with low tree forests, and low tree forests planted with pasture and green manure, which not only provides fertilizer for grain production, but also provides feed for animal husbandry. Third, make multiple uses of one piece of land, intercrop oil and grain, and combine long-term interests with current interests. Because grain is planted in the oil crop forest, it is necessary to repair dikes to store water and conserve soil, fertilize and weed, so that not only the survival rate of young trees is high, growth is fast, and fruiting is early, but also more grain can be harvested. For example, in the 310 mu of newly planted walnut forest in the Bayi Production Team of Shangnan County in 1954, grain was intercropped, and the survival rate of young trees reached 95%. Fruiting began in 1957, three or four years earlier than ordinary walnuts; grain yield increased from 130 jin per mu to 260 jin in 1959. Fourth, take methods such as grafting, cuttings, and transplantation to make woody oil-bearing plants "settle" on the mountains; for wild woody oil-bearing plants on the mountains, also through grafting, cuttings, transplantation, and other methods, discover them on the spot, cultivate and propagate them on the spot, so that scattered trees gradually become forests, and at the same time improve the variety of walnuts. Some places use walnut buds to graft with wild walnuts, *huaxiang* (Pterocarya stenoptera), *fengyang* (Populus davidiana) on the high mountains, so that walnut fruiting is advanced by two or three years. These four methods, we summarize them into thirty-two characters, namely: advance to the mountains, find the key, comprehensively develop, fully utilize, oil-bearing plants go uphill, give way to grain, grain and oil are luxuriant, and fly wing to wing.

    Thanks to the "large scale and high degree of public ownership" of the People's Commune, and the discovery of ways to solve the land competition between oil and grain, give way to grain, and comprehensively develop grain and oil, the entire area's movement of planting various woody oil-bearing plants, mainly walnuts, uphill has entered a new stage. As of now, more than ten kinds of woody oil-bearing plants have formed lines into belts and belts into networks on the mountains, of which the intercropping area of grain and oil has reached more than 300,000 mu. Through comprehensive measures such as afforestation, soil and water conservation, and oil-grain intercropping, more than 100,000 mu of barren hills and river滩地 have been planted with grain crops, and more than ten kinds of wild oil crops have begun to be cultivated and propagated on barren hills.

    木本油料上山　粮油全都丰收
    中共陕西商雒地委第一书记　王杰
    为了大力贯彻执行党中央提出的“全党动手，全民动手，大办农业，大办粮食”的方针，中共陕西商雒地委在总结已往经验的基础上，提出了几条具体措施。其中有一条，就是让木本油料上山，给粮食让出耕地。
    商雒专区自从1957年以来，大种以核桃为主的各种木本油料，取得了一定的成绩。通过这一活动，不仅为改变全区“一穷二白”的面貌提供了条件，而且使人们在向自然斗争的过程中，进一步坚定了“人定胜天”、“事在人为”和穷面貌能够改变的信心，发扬了越穷越干，越难越干的无产阶级革命精神。但是，在我们领导这一运动的前期，由于经验不足，计划不周，加上受到高级社规模小的限制，因而一些地方把以核桃为主的各种木本油料多集中栽种在粮食的耕地上，甚至把山上的野生木本油料搬下山来，这就发生了油粮争地的矛盾。
    商雒地区的自然特点是：山大沟深，面积辽阔，可耕地少，自然灾害频繁，粮食产量不大稳定。因此，不仅不能因发展木本油料而占用耕地，还得设法扩大耕地面积，变低产为高产，尽快地增产粮食。在土地不足的情况下，既要抓粮、又要抓油，出路何在？只有一条，这就是木本油料上山。
    人民公社的诞生，为解决油粮争地矛盾开辟了广阔的道路。商雒地委乘此大好时机，一方面，指示各地根据公社“一大二公”的优越性和广大群众的愿望，全面规划，合理布局，把造林和治山、造林和农业、造林和放牧等结合起来，迅速推动营造木本油料上山的运动；另一方面，通过调查访问，在群众中取得了彻底解决油粮争地矛盾的办法。这就是：第一，种树和水土保持相结合。即通过挖鱼鳞坑、水平沟等，拦洪蓄水，积土、积肥，把木本油料移栽或种植到山腰和荒山上。这样，随着种植面积和水土保持工程的逐年扩大控制了水土流失，就可以一方面将荒山、荒坡逐渐变成种庄稼的耕地；另一方面使河床逐年稳定，也能把河滩地充分利用起来。商县龙王庙管区就是通过这种办法，三年来，已在一千七百多亩荒山荒坡上种上了庄稼，又修复河滩地四十五亩。第二，合理种植，因地因树配植。如油桐、油茶等灌木油料，枝杆小，复蔽小，从栽种到成林，既可一直间作套种，又可由山下向山上种植；现在种在缓坡或平川耕地上的，可以通过水土保持和油粮间作，改良土壤，变荒地为耕地。这样就使木本油料步步高升，通过停林还农，为粮食作物年年腾出耕地。又如在已成林的乔木（如漆籽、核桃等）林下，选择喜阴湿的灌木（如白乳木等）间作，灌木油料林下再种喜阴湿的苜蓿、药材等作物，这样因地因树合理配植的结果，也可解决油料和粮食，油料和牧草之间的争地矛盾。像商南县武关公社寺底铺生产队，有二亩橡树（乔木）林，林下长的是已成林的白乳木，白乳木下又长的是小白乳木和苜蓿等，三层都生长得很健壮，光白乳木籽今年就收了近一百斤，幼苗还可移栽一百多亩土地。有的还采取高杆林下套低杆林，低杆林下又种牧草和绿肥，既为粮食生产提供了肥料，又为牧业提供了饲料。第三，一地多用，油粮间作，把长远利益和当前利益结合起来。因为油料林里种了粮食，就要修埂蓄水和保土，施肥和锄草，这样，不仅使幼林成活率高、生长快、结实早，而且可以多收粮食。如商南县八一生产队，1954年在新种的三百一十亩核桃林里间作了粮食，幼林成活率达95％，1957年开始结实，比一般核桃早结实三、四年；粮食产量由原来的亩产一百三十斤增加到1959年的二百六十斤。第四，采取嫁接、插条、移栽等方法，使木本油料在山上“落户”；对山上的野生木本油料，也通过嫁接、插条、移栽等办法，就地发现，就地培育繁殖，使零星树木逐年成林，同时还可以改良核桃的品种。有些地方用核桃芽子与高山上野核桃、化香、枫杨等嫁接，使核桃结实提早二、三年。这四种办法，我们把它概括为三十二个字，即：向山进军，寻找窃门，综合开发，全面利用，油料上山，为粮让地，粮油并茂，比翼双飞。
    由于有了“一大二公”的人民公社，又找到了解决油粮争地、为粮让地和粮油全面发展的途径，全区以种植核桃为主的各种木本油料上山进入了一个新阶段。截至目前，已有十多种木本油料在山上连点成带，连带成网，其中粮油间作面积达三十多万亩。通过造林、水土保持、油粮间作等综合措施，使原来的十多万亩荒山和河滩地种上了粮食作物，并有十多种野生油料开始在荒山上培育和繁殖。
