    The Reliable Defender of the Cuban Revolution
    ——The Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Revolutionary Militia
    Zhang Ye
      Run forward, to war, to the battlefield!
      Homeland, our heroic battle
      Is your protective shield!
    These are the verses written by the great Cuban national hero and patriotic poet José Martí more than seventy years ago during the Cuban war against Spanish colonial rule. They once summoned, mobilized, and organized the Cuban people to fight for national independence like a bugle call. Today, as U.S. imperialism intensifies its plots for armed intervention in Cuba, and Cuba faces a serious threat of foreign invasion, the Cuban people, especially the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces and the Revolutionary Militia, are urgently mobilizing and preparing for battle, so that once the enemy invades, they will resolutely and bravely "run forward, to war, to the battlefield" to defend the motherland and the revolution.
    The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces are an army full of patriotism and rich in democratic traditions, and are the faithful defenders of the fruits of the Cuban revolution and national sovereignty. It was established after the victory of the Cuban revolution and the complete destruction of the Batista dictatorship's military machine, with the Rebel Army as its backbone, including the Army, Air Force, Navy, and National Revolutionary Police, and commanded by the Revolutionary Armed Forces Ministry headed by Raúl Castro.
    The Cuban people's overthrow of the Batista dictatorship and the victory of the revolution mainly relied on the armed struggle of the Rebel Army. On December 2, 1957, eighty-one patriotic youths led and commanded by Fidel Castro landed on the east coast of Cuba aboard the yacht "Granma." Although they were brutally suppressed by Batista's army, the twelve survivors reorganized their forces, closely relied on local farmers, and established guerrilla units. Later, with the assistance and cooperation of revolutionary struggles in the plains, especially the urban workers' movement, they continuously grew in battle, transformed from small to large, from weak to strong, expanded from guerrilla units into the Rebel Army, developed from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare, moved from the mountains to the plains, from regional battles to marching into the capital, and finally overthrew the Batista dictatorship, armed to the teeth and supported by U.S. imperialism, and achieved the victory of the revolution.
    The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, with the officers and soldiers of the Rebel Army as its core (more than 90% of the members of the Rebel Army were farmers, agricultural workers, and patriotic and progressive intellectuals), have been continuously strengthened and expanded in the two years since the victory of the revolution. Now the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces not only have an army that has flesh-and-blood ties with the masses, but also have begun to establish an air force and navy. The reactionary army of the old regime has been completely reorganized, all Batista elements in the old army have been purged, and revolutionary traitors and wavering elements mixed in the Revolutionary Armed Forces, such as former Air Force Commander Díaz Lanz, have also been gradually purged, which has made the composition of the Revolutionary Armed Forces increasingly pure. In the Revolutionary Armed Forces, cultural and political study movements have also been carried out, training has been conducted, and equipment has been strengthened, so that the cultural level, political awareness, and combat quality of the officers and soldiers of the Revolutionary Armed Forces have been continuously improved. This armed force has also continued to carry forward the fine tradition of unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the army and the people during the armed struggle period of the Rebel Army. The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces have few levels and little difference in treatment; the bad habits of the old army, such as wide disparities in military ranks, officers oppressing soldiers, and soldiers bullying the people, have been eliminated. This force also actively participates in the country's economic and social restructuring work. Officers and soldiers help farmers develop production in rural areas, build houses, and actively participate in government public construction projects such as reclaiming wasteland, transforming swamp areas, building water conservancy projects, and building school cities. Therefore, the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces are an army that is loved by the people, guards the motherland vigilantly, and engages in peaceful construction. Since this force was able to defeat the Batista reactionary army, which was fully supported by U.S. imperialism, with a small number of people and poor equipment, today, this force, which has greatly improved in quantity, quality, equipment, and the awareness of officers and soldiers, and has the support of the entire people, will certainly be able to defeat the enemy's aggression and attacks.
    Revolutionary Cuba not only has such an armed force that can defend the motherland and defend the revolution, but also has universally established revolutionary militia organizations throughout the country, among workers, farmers, university students, and other social strata.
    The Cuban militia was spontaneously organized by workers, farmers, and students at the end of April 1959 when U.S. imperialism wantonly slandered Cuba's execution of war criminals and rudely interfered in the Cuban revolution. Since then, with the intensification of U.S. imperialism's conspiracy of aggression and interference, under the call of Cuban revolutionary leaders and political parties and organizations such as the "July 26th Movement," the Revolutionary Guidance Committee, the Cuban People's Socialist Party, and the Cuban Workers' Confederation, the Cuban militia has been organized more and more widely, and has intensified military training and mastered weapons. On January 8 this year, the Revolutionary Armed Forces Ministry established the National Leadership Committee of the Revolutionary Militia, appointed Rogelio Acevedo González as chairman, and ordered the heads of all armed forces to provide convenient conditions for military training to all Cuban people who voluntarily request military training. Prime Minister Fidel Castro also personally led the armed militia battalion of Havana students to engage in training in the Sierra Maestra mountains, the old base of the Rebel Army. Since then, the work of organizing militia and military training has formed a truly broad mass movement in various parts of Cuba, and centers for training militia have been established throughout the country. At the beginning of March, a climax of donating aircraft and weapons was launched throughout the country.
    In the upsurge of organizing the militia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces Ministry announced the "Revolutionary Militia Regulations" in April, making the Cuban militia, which had been widely organized, have formal rules. The regulations stipulate that the purpose of establishing and organizing the militia "is to cooperate with the Revolutionary Armed Forces to defend the revolution, resist any armed attack by enemies at home and abroad, and defend national sovereignty, the territory of the motherland, land reform, and other revolutionary laws"; "the militia is an auxiliary force subordinate to the Revolutionary Armed Forces," and its "military organization is similar in form to the Rebel Army." The regulations also determined the seven obligations of the militia, including: "loyalty to the Cuban revolution," "completing the task of armed struggle against aggression, being vigilant against sabotage activities, and fulfilling other obligations." In addition, the regulations also stipulate that elements connected with the Batista tyranny and its repressive organs, senior employees of foreign companies, corrupt and degenerate elements, and bandits shall not participate in the militia, which ensures the purity of the militia organization.
    With the increasing intensification of U.S. imperialism's interference and aggression against the Cuban revolution, the Cuban militia organization has grown day by day. By May 1 this year, this island nation with a population of 6.5 million had organized one million militia. On May 1, the national militia gathered in the capital Havana to receive a review, and together with the citizens of Havana, held a massive anti-American demonstration of 1.5 million people. Since then, the training and equipment of the Cuban militia have been continuously improved. At present, among the one million militia nationwide, 250,000 have been equipped with new weapons. At the end of October, when Cuba faced the serious threat of U.S. imperialism's armed aggression, Havana and various towns in the country held large-scale militia mobilization rallies. In the rallies, the trained militia battalions organized combat battalions and accepted the instructions issued to them. Prime Minister Fidel Castro personally inspected the militia camps in Havana, encouraged the militia, and issued instructions to prepare to go to battle to counterattack the invaders who dared to land on Cuban soil. The executive committee of the Cuban Workers' Confederation and the thirty-three trade union federations made a resolution at a meeting held on October 31, requiring workers to prepare for battle and "turn every workplace into a barracks for the working class to conduct production and combat." After this, more cities in Cuba held militia demonstrations and parades against U.S. imperialism's aggression and in defense of the motherland. Thousands of backbone militia have gone to Las Villas Province in the central region and Oriente Province in the east to prevent enemy invasion. Cuban Prime Minister Castro and Revolutionary Armed Forces Minister Raúl Castro reviewed the parade of thousands of militia in Santiago de Cuba. Holding weapons and full of fighting enthusiasm, the militia unanimously expressed their determination to oppose U.S. imperialism's armed aggression, and solemnly swore: "Loyal to the motherland and the revolutionary government, and if necessary, dedicate our lives to defend our revolution and our territory."
    The Cuban militia, which inherits and carries forward the glorious traditions of the Rebel Army, as an auxiliary force of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, has shown unparalleled power and made great contributions in guarding sugarcane fields, rushing to harvest sugarcane, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, searching for bandits, and defending the revolution and the territory of the motherland. On the one hand, they are intensifying production, working hard, and studying at their posts. On the other hand, they are closely cooperating with the Revolutionary Armed Forces, guarding every mountain, every beach, every city, and every village in the motherland day and night, ready to meet the U.S. military aggression at any time. The counter-revolutionary bandits who landed in Navas Bay, Oriente Province on October 5, armed by U.S. imperialism and participated in by Americans, were defeated by the joint forces of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces and the peasant militia. Prior to this, the armed counter-revolutionary bandits who carried out rebellious activities in the Escambray Mountains in September and October, directly supported by the United States, were also mainly eliminated by the local peasant militia. In order to wipe out this gang of 150 counter-revolutionary rebels, the Cuban revolutionary government mobilized and trained thousands of peasant militia in the Escambray Mountains. They were led by officers of the Rebel Army and received the support of the workers' militia. After 29 days of fighting, they finally successfully completed the task and wiped out this gang of bandits. In this way, the heroic Cuban militia has been continuously growing, tempered, and improving its combat effectiveness in the struggle against U.S. imperialism's aggression and interference, especially in the actual battles of suppressing bandits and chasing invaders.
    Recently, U.S. imperialism has intensified its criminal conspiracy to subvert the Cuban revolutionary government. On November 17, U.S. President Eisenhower even ordered the U.S. Navy to dispatch naval and air forces to the Caribbean Sea near Cuba and its airspace, deliberately aggravating international tensions, suppressing the national democratic movements in Guatemala and Nicaragua, and openly carrying out armed threats against Cuba. The danger of Cuba facing a U.S. armed attack is greater than ever. However, the heroic Cuban people, united and persistent in their struggle, have prepared to defeat any possible invasion. The Cuban people understand that the fruits of the revolution obtained through armed struggle must also be defended through armed struggle. Now, Cuba already has a Revolutionary Armed Forces and Revolutionary Militia with unprecedentedly improved awareness, increasingly stronger combat effectiveness, and equipment. Under the current excellent international situation, as long as the Cuban people rely on their rock-solid unity and unyielding struggle, and rely on this Revolutionary Armed Forces and Revolutionary Militia that comes from the people and draws strength from the people, they will surely be able to defeat all interference and aggression conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. Just as Prime Minister Fidel Castro pointed out in his speech at the graduation ceremony of the first phase of the revolutionary militia in the Sierra Maestra mountains not long ago: "When the entire island of Cuba is organized, every farmer will use weapons, and every worker, student, and every man and woman in Cuba knows how to use weapons, we will see who can destroy our motherland, no matter how powerful he is." Now, the entire Cuba is a national army, and everyone can use weapons. If the enemies of the Cuban revolution dare to invade Cuban territory, the Cuban people will certainly execute the oath of "swearing to defend the motherland" with their lives and blood. The "We will win" that resounds throughout Cuba will not only be a slogan, but also a truth. (Attached picture)

    古巴革命的可靠保卫者
    ——革命武装部队和革命民兵
    章叶
      跑上前去，向战争，向战场！
      祖国啊，我们的英勇的战斗
      就是你护身的盾甲！
    这是古巴伟大的民族英雄、爱国诗人何塞·马蒂七十多年前在古巴反西班牙殖民统治战争时期所写的诗句，它曾经像号角一样地召唤、动员和组织了古巴人民为争取民族独立而战斗。今天，当美帝国主义日益加紧策划对古巴进行武装干涉，古巴正面临着外国侵略的严重威胁的时候，古巴人民，特别是古巴革命武装部队和革命民兵，正在紧急地动员起来，作好战斗准备，以便一旦敌人入侵，坚决和勇敢地“跑上前去，向战争，向战场”，保卫祖国，保卫革命。
    古巴革命武装部队是一支充满爱国主义精神和富有民主传统的军队，是古巴革命果实和国家主权的忠实捍卫者。它是在古巴革命胜利、彻底摧毁巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的军事机器后，以起义军为骨干建立起来的，包括有陆军、空军、海军和国家革命警察，由以劳尔·卡斯特罗为部长的革命武装部统率指挥。
    古巴人民推翻巴蒂斯塔独裁政权和取得革命胜利，主要是依靠起义军的武装斗争。1957年12月2日由菲德尔·卡斯特罗率领和指挥的八十一名爱国青年乘“格拉玛”号汽艇在古巴东海岸登陆，虽然遭到巴蒂斯塔军队的残酷镇压，幸存的十二个人重新组织了力量，紧密依靠当地农民，建立起了游击队。后来又得到平原革命斗争特别是城市工人运动的援助和配合，在战斗中不断成长，由小变大，由弱变强，由游击队扩大成为起义军，由游击战发展为运动战，由山区进入平原，由地区性战斗到进军首都，终于推翻了美帝国主义支持的武装到牙齿的巴蒂斯塔独裁政权，取得了革命的胜利。
    以起义军官兵（起义军的成员90％以上是农民、农业工人和爱国进步的知识分子）为核心的古巴革命武装部队，在革命取得胜利后的两年中，不断得到加强和扩大。现在古巴革命武装部队不仅有与群众有血肉联系的陆军，而且开始建立了空军和海军。旧政权的反动军队已经经过了彻底改组，旧军队中所有的巴蒂斯塔分子全部被清除，混在革命武装部队中的如前空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯之流的革命叛徒和动摇分子，也都逐步遭到清洗，这就使革命武装部队的成份日益纯洁。在革命武装部队中，还开展了文化和政治学习运动，进行了练兵和加强装备，使革命武装部队官兵的文化水平、政治觉悟和战斗素质不断得到提高。这支武装部队并且继续发扬了起义军在武装斗争时期官兵团结、军民团结的优良传统。古巴革命武装部队的级别不多、待遇区别不大；旧军队中军阶悬殊、官压迫兵、军欺负民的恶习得到了清除。这支部队还积极参加国家经济和社会结构的改革工作。官兵在农村中帮助农民发展生产，修建住宅，大力参加如开垦荒地、改造沼泽地区、兴修水利和建设学校城等政府公共建设工程。因此，古巴革命武装部队是一支受到人民爱戴的、一面警惕地保卫祖国一面从事和平建设的军队。这支部队过去既然能在人数少、装备差的情况下，击溃了美帝国主义所全力支持的巴蒂斯塔反动军队，在今天，这支部队不论在数量上、质量上、装备上以及官兵的觉悟程度上都大大提高以及得到全体人民的拥护和支持的情况下，是一定能够战胜敌人的侵略和进攻的。
    革命的古巴不仅有上述这样一支能够保卫祖国和保卫革命的武装部队，并且在全国范围内，在工人、农民、大学生和其他社会阶层中普遍建立了革命民兵组织。
    古巴的民兵是在1959年4月底美帝国主义对古巴处决战犯大肆诽谤和粗暴干涉古巴革命的时候，由工人、农民和学生自动组织起来的。从那时以后，随着美帝国主义侵略和干涉阴谋活动的加紧，在古巴革命领袖和“7月26日运动”、革命指导委员会、古巴人民社会党、古巴工人联合会等政党和团体的号召下，古巴的民兵越来越多和越来越普遍地组织起来，并且加紧进行军事训练和掌握了武器。今年1月8日，古巴革命武装部建立了革命民兵全国领导委员会，任命罗赫略·阿塞维多·冈萨雷斯为委员长，并命令各武装部队首脑，对所有自愿要求军事训练的古巴人民提供军事训练的方便条件。菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理还亲自率领哈瓦那学生的武装民兵大队到起义军老根据地马埃斯特腊山区从事训练。从这以后，组织民兵和军事训练的工作，在古巴各地形成了一个真正广泛的群众性运动，全国各地都成立了训练民兵的中心。3月初在全国范围内掀起了一个捐献飞机武器的高潮。
    在组织民兵的热潮中，革命武装部在4月公布了“革命民兵条例”，使古巴已经广泛组织起来的民兵有了正式规章。条例规定，创立和组织民兵的目的“是为了和革命武装部队合作来保卫革命，反对内外敌人的任何武装进攻，保卫国家主权、祖国领土、土地改革和其他革命法律”；“民兵是隶属于革命武装部的辅助部队”，其“军事组织的形式和起义军相似”。条例还确定了民兵的七项义务，其中有：“忠于古巴革命”，“完成反侵略武装斗争的任务，对破坏活动提高警惕和履行其他义务”。此外，条例还规定，与巴蒂斯塔暴政及其镇压机构有联系的分子、外国公司的高级雇员、腐化堕落分子和盗匪不得参加民兵，这就保证了民兵组织的纯洁性。
    随着美帝国主义干涉侵略古巴革命的日益加紧，古巴民兵组织日益壮大，到今年5月1日，这个六百五十万人口的岛国，已经组织起一百万民兵。在5月1日这一天，全国民兵集中到首都哈瓦那接受检阅，并同哈瓦那市民一起举行了一次一百五十万人的反美大示威。此后古巴民兵的训练和装备不断提高。目前，全国一百万民兵中，已经有二十五万人配备有新式武器。10月底，当古巴面临美帝国主义武装侵略的严重威胁的时候，哈瓦那和国内各个城镇都举行规模盛大的民兵动员集会。在集会中，已经受过训练的民兵大队组织起了战斗营，并且接受了发给他们的指令。菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理亲自巡视了哈瓦那的民兵营地，并对民兵进行了勉励和发布了准备走上战斗岗位去反击胆敢在古巴土地登陆的入侵者的指令。古巴工人联合会执行委员会和三十三个工会联合会，在10月31日举行的会议上作出决议，要求工人作好战斗准备，并“把每一个工作场所变成一个工人阶级进行生产战斗的兵营”。在这以后，古巴更多的城市举行了反对美帝国主义侵略和保卫祖国的民兵示威游行。已有数千基干民兵开往中部拉斯维利亚斯省和东部的奥连特省以防止敌人入侵。古巴总理卡斯特罗和革命武装部长劳尔·卡斯特罗在古巴圣地亚哥检阅了数以千计的民兵游行队伍。手执武器、满怀战斗热情的民兵们一致表示决心反对美帝国主义的武装侵略，并且庄严宣誓：“忠于祖国和革命政府，如果需要，就为保卫我们的革命和我国领土而献出生命”。
    继承和发扬起义军光荣传统的古巴民兵，作为革命武装部的辅助部队，在守卫甘蔗田、抢收甘蔗、镇压反革命、搜捕匪徒、保卫革命和祖国领土等方面，已经显出了无比威力，作出了巨大贡献。他们一方面在自己的岗位上加紧生产，努力工作、学习，另方面与革命武装部队密切配合，日日夜夜地警戒着祖国的每个山头，每个海滩，每个城市和乡村，准备随时迎击美国的军事侵略。10月5日在奥连特省纳瓦斯湾登陆、由美帝国主义武装、并有美国人参加的反革命匪徒，就是由古巴革命武装部队和农民民兵的联合部队击溃的。在这以前，9、10月间由美国直接支持在埃斯坎布拉伊山进行叛乱活动的武装反革命匪帮，也是主要由当地农民民兵肃清的。为了剿灭这批为数一百五十人的反革命叛乱，古巴革命政府动员和训练了埃斯坎布拉伊山的数以千计的农民民兵，他们由起义军军官领导，并且取得了工人民兵的支持，经过二十九天的战斗，终于胜利完成任务，全歼了这股匪徒。英勇的古巴民兵就是这样在反击美帝国主义侵略和干涉的斗争中，特别是在清剿叛匪、追击入侵者的实际战斗中，不断壮大、得到锻炼和提高自己的战斗力。
    最近，美帝国主义变本加厉地策划颠复古巴革命政府的罪恶阴谋。11月17日，美国总统艾森豪威尔竟命令美国海军出动海上和空中部队，前往古巴附近加勒比海海面及其上空，蓄意加剧国际紧张局势，镇压危地马拉、尼加拉瓜的民族民主运动，并公开对古巴进行武装威胁。古巴面临美国武装进攻的危险比任何时候都更大了。但是，团结一致、坚持斗争的英勇的古巴人民，已经为击溃任何可能的入侵做好了准备。古巴人民懂得用武装斗争得来的革命果实还要用武装斗争来保卫。现在，古巴已经拥有一支觉悟空前提高、战斗力和装备日益强大的革命武装部队和革命民兵。在当前大好的国际形势下，古巴人民只要依靠自己的磐石般的团结和不屈不挠的斗争，依靠这支来自人民并从人民中吸取力量的革命武装部队和革命民兵，就一定能够战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的一切干涉和侵略阴谋。正像菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理不久前在马埃斯特腊山区一期革命民兵结业典礼的讲话中所指出的：“当整个古巴岛组织起来，每个农民都会使用武器，每个工人、学生和古巴每个男人和女人都知道使用武器的时候，我们倒要看看谁能摧毁我们的祖国，不管他多么强大。”现在，整个古巴已经是全民皆兵，全民都会使用武器了。如果古巴革命的敌人胆敢进犯古巴国土，古巴人民必将以自己的生命和热血来执行“誓死保卫祖国”的誓言。响彻古巴的“我们必胜”，将不仅是一个口号，而且是一个真理。（附图片）
