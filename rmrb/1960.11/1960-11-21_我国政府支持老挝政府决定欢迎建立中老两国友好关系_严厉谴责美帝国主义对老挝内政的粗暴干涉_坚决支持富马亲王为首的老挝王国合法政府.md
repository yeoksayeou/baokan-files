Xinhua News Agency, 20th — The Government of the People's Republic of China today issued a statement supporting the Kingdom of Laos' government's decision to establish friendly relations between China and Laos. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Government of the People's Republic of China on Supporting the Kingdom of Laos' Government's Decision to Establish Friendly Relations Between China and Laos
November 20, 1960

On November 17 and 18, 1960, the Kingdom of Laos successively published the press communique of the government meeting of the Kingdom of Laos and the first joint communique of the delegation of the Kingdom of Laos and the delegation of the Lao Patriotic Front. These two communiques announced: the government of the Kingdom of Laos will accept assistance from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and will soon send a friendly delegation to visit the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to negotiate the establishment of economic and cultural relations; decided to restore postal and telecommunications links between Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; and guarantee good-neighborly relations between Laos and the People's Republic of of China. The Government of the People's Republic of China warmly welcomes the above-mentioned expressions of the Government of the Kingdom of Laos aimed at strengthening the friendly and good-neighborly relations between China and Laos and peace in the Indochina region, and is prepared to take corresponding measures to promote their realization.

As is well known, the People's Republic of China is a participant in the 1954 Geneva Conference and a guarantor of the Geneva Agreements, and is also a close neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos. The Chinese government has always strictly adhered to the Geneva Agreements, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, respecting Laos' independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and supporting the Kingdom of Laos government's policy of peaceful neutrality and the realization of domestic unity. China and Laos have historically been friendly neighbors, and our friendly relations have developed in new ways since the Geneva Conference. The visit of the delegation of the Kingdom of Laos, headed by Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, to our country in August 1956 was a concrete manifestation of the development of this friendly relationship. Prime Minister Phouma and our Premier Zhou Enlai, in a joint statement, stated that the two governments agreed to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and develop good-neighborly relations between the two countries, and agreed to develop economic and cultural relations between the two countries. The border between our two countries has always been a peaceful and friendly border, and it should always be a peaceful and friendly border in the future. There are favorable conditions between our two countries for developing economic and trade relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We believe that if the recent proposals made by the Kingdom of Laos government can be realized, it will be conducive to the establishment and development of friendly and good-neighborly relations and economic and cultural relations between China and Laos.

The Chinese government believes that the current unstable situation in Laos is the result of US imperialism's support for the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group. The Chinese government sternly condemns US imperialism's crude interference in Laos' internal affairs, firmly supports the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos headed by Prince Phouma, and believes that as long as the Lao people can strengthen internal unity and resolutely oppose foreign interference and subversive activities, they will definitely be able to overcome the difficulties on the road forward, realize Laos' peaceful neutrality, national harmony, and national unity, and build the Kingdom of Laos into a prosperous and strong country. The Chinese government hopes that all participating countries in the Geneva Conference will strictly abide by the Geneva Agreements and respect the national rights of the Lao people in order to safeguard Laos' peaceful neutrality, independence, and unity.

    我国政府支持老挝政府决定欢迎建立中老两国友好关系
    严厉谴责美帝国主义对老挝内政的粗暴干涉  坚决支持富马亲王为首的老挝王国合法政府
    新华社20日讯　中华人民共和国政府今天发表声明，支持老挝王国政府决定建立中老友好关系。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府关于支持老挝王国政府决定建立中老友好关系的声明
                                       1960年11月20日
    1960年11月17日和18日，老挝王国先后公布了老挝王国政府会议公报和老挝王国政府代表团同老挝爱国战线党代表团谈判的第一号联合公报。这两个公报宣告：老挝王国政府将接受中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国的援助，并且最近将派遣一个友好代表团访问中华人民共和国和越南民主共和国，以便就建立经济和文化关系进行谈判；决定恢复老挝同越南民主共和国之间的邮电联系；保证老挝同中华人民共和国的睦邻关系。中华人民共和国政府热诚欢迎老挝王国政府上述旨在加强中、老两国之间友好睦邻关系和印度支那地区和平的表示，并且准备采取相应措施，促其实现。
    如所周知，中华人民共和国是1954年日内瓦会议的参加国和日内瓦协议的保证国，又是老挝王国的近邻。中国政府一贯严格信守日内瓦协议、和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，尊重老挝的独立、主权和领土完整，支持老挝王国政府执行和平中立和实现国内团结的政策。中、老两国在历史上是友好的邻邦，日内瓦会议以后我们两国的友好关系有了新的发展。1956年8月，以梭发那·富马首相为首的老挝王国政府代表团访问我国就是这种友好关系发展的具体表现。富马首相和我国周恩来总理，在联合声明中，曾经表示，两国政府同意遵守和平共处五项原则和发展两国之间的睦邻关系，并且同意发展两国之间的经济和文化关系。我们两国的边界从来是和平友好的边界，而且今后也应该永远是和平友好的边界。我们两国之间存在着在平等互利的基础上发展经济贸易关系的有利条件。我们相信，老挝王国政府最近作出的建议如能实现，必将有利于中、老两国友好睦邻关系和经济文化关系的建立和发展。
    中国政府认为，老挝当前不稳定的局势是美帝国主义支持富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的结果。中国政府严厉谴责美帝国主义对老挝内政的粗暴干涉，坚决支持以富马亲王为首的老挝王国的合法政府，并且认为，只要老挝人民能够加强内部团结，坚决反对外力的干涉和颠复活动，就一定能够战胜前进道路上的困难，实现老挝的和平中立、民族和睦和国家统一，把老挝王国建设成为一个繁荣富强的国家。中国政府希望所有日内瓦会议参加国都严格遵守日内瓦协议，尊重老挝人民的民族权利，以维护老挝的和平中立和独立统一。
