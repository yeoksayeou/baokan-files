Cloud Grazing
Yu Haiquan
Jinggang Mountain is so high,
Mountains are stacked and trees are lined,
Green grassland on Lion Rock,
The grass waves roll like an ocean.
Thick clouds and dense fog cover the earth,
No east, no west can be seen,
The sound of sheep comes from the opposite side,
Pushing through the clouds to find the sheep.

    云中放羊
    于海泉井冈山呀高万丈，山峰成叠树成行，狮子岩上绿草地，草浪滚滚似海洋。浓云密雾罩大地，不见东来不见西，对面传来羊叫声，拨开云雾把羊寻。
