Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 3rd: The Lao Combat Forces Radio broadcast on November 3rd: A group of troops controlled by a traitorous clique in Nam Lan Township, Phongsaly Province, cooperated with the traitorous clique in Phong Saly Township from October 23rd to 25th to attack the Lao Combat Forces. In order to protect the lives and property of the people, the people's armed forces launched a heroic counterattack against the rebels in Phong Saly on October 26th and defeated them. The panicked rebels abandoned their strongholds and fled. The people destroyed their strongholds and seized some weapons, recovering all the property they had looted.

In Khammouane Province, in order to prevent the rebels from moving to North Kading, the people's armed forces intercepted a squadron of the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group in the Chuan Wang area on October 21st, seizing eighteen guns, 2,400 rounds of ammunition, and some military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 3rd: The Lao Combat Forces Radio commented on November 2nd on the so-called "aid" of the United States to Laos, saying that the Lao people and public opinion strongly oppose the false "aid" of US imperialism.

The commentary said that US imperialism regards itself as the master of Laos, and how much "US aid" is given to whom is entirely determined by them. The commentary pointed out that US imperialism's "aid" to the Phoumi Nosavan reactionary group exceeds its "aid" to the Phouma government. The "aid" given by US imperialism to the Royal Government is like the wages it pays to its employees; the "aid" is paid monthly, for example, the "aid" for September is only paid in October. The expenses of various military regions are also directly distributed by them, that is, the various troops are directly managed by the United States.

The commentary pointed out that this practice of US imperialism is not surprising, because the so-called "aid" of US imperialism to Laos is actually the employment fee for the pro-American group, so as to employ the pro-American group as a tool to suppress the patriotic people who oppose the US enslavement of Laos.

The commentary emphasized that the United States must cut off aid to the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group. Laos should only accept unconditional aid without any supervision.

Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: Bangkok News: The United States is stepping up "cooperation" with Thailand, plotting further interference in Laos' internal affairs.

According to the "World Evening News" on October 29th, the US Ambassador to Thailand, Johnson, held two secret meetings with Thai Foreign Minister Nai Thanat Khoman on October 25th and 26th. Immediately afterwards, on the 28th, he met with Nai Thanat Khoman for the third time for an hour of secret talks. Sources revealed that the main purpose of such frequent contact between the US Ambassador and the Thai Foreign Minister was to discuss the situation in Laos and plan measures to interfere in Laos' internal affairs. In order to implement the conspiracy to intervene in Laos, the Sarit reactionary ruling group has recently stepped up activities on the Thai-Laotian border.

According to reports, the Thai Ministry of Interior, under the pretext of "preventing smuggling on the Thai-Laotian border," organized an "investigation team" on October 30th to go to Nong Khai Province, which is close to the Lao border.

The news also revealed that the members of this "investigation team," which was ordered by Sarit, included Khun Nakorn, Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Interior, Nai Pracha, Commander-in-Chief of the Inland Police, and Nai Prasong, Political Inspector of the Ministry of Interior. This "investigation team" will set up a "headquarters" in Nong Khai Province to carry out its so-called "sweeping up smuggling on the Thai-Laotian border."

According to a Bangkok newspaper report on the 28th, the "Border Committee" stationed in Nong Khai Province by the Thai Ministry of Interior also recently ordered the mobilization of all border police to deploy along the Mekong River from Chang Mai County to Ban Gan County, under the pretext of dealing with the so-called "provocative actions" of the Lao government.

    老挝丰沙里省人民武装击退叛军进攻
    寮国战斗部队电台揭露美“援”是奴役人民的工具
    美国继续策划干涉老挝的阴谋　泰国加紧在泰老边境活动
    新华社河内3日电　寮国战斗部队电台11月3日广播：丰沙里省南蓝乡的一支叛国集团控制的军队，10月23日到25日同在丰赛乡的叛国集团配合一起进攻寮国战斗部队。为了保护人民的生命财产，人民武装力量在10月26日向在丰赛的叛军进行了英勇的反击，并把他们击溃。慌乱不堪的叛军放弃了据点逃窜。人民破坏了他们的据点，并缴获了一些武器，收回了被他们抢去的全部财产。
    在甘蒙省，为了阻止叛军向北卡丁调动，人民武装力量10月21日在川王地区截击了富米·诺萨万叛国集团的一个中队，缴获了十八支枪、二千四百发子弹和一些军用物资。
    新华社河内3日电　寮国战斗部队电台2日就美国对老挝的所谓“援助”发表评论说，老挝人民和舆论强烈反对美帝国主义的虚假“援助”。
    评论说，美帝国主义把自己看作老挝的主子，“美援”给谁多少完全要由他们来决定。评论指出，美帝国主义对富米·诺萨万反动集团的“援助”，超过了对富马政府的“援助”。美帝国主义给王国政府的“援助”如同它发给雇佣人员的工资一样，“援”款按月付给，例如10月份才发9月份的“援”款。各军区的费用也由他们直接发给，即各部队要由美国直接管理。
    评论指出，美帝国主义的这种做法，并不令人感到奇怪，因为美帝国主义的所谓“援助”老挝，实际上是给亲美集团的雇佣费，以便起用亲美集团作为镇压反对美国奴役老挝的爱国人民的工具。
    评论强调说，美国必须断绝对富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的援助。老挝只应接受无条件的、不受任何监督的援助。
    新华社1日讯　曼谷消息：美国正加紧同泰国“合作”，密谋进一步干涉老挝内政。
    据“世界晚报”10月29日报道，美国驻泰国大使约翰逊在10月25日和26日两次同泰国外交部长乃他纳·科曼举行秘密会谈。紧接着在28日又第三次会见乃他纳·科曼，作了一小时的密谈。消息透露，美国大使同泰国外交部长这样频繁接触的主要目的，是为了商谈老挝的局势，策划干涉老挝内政的措施。为了执行干预老挝的阴谋计划，乃沙立反动统治集团最近正加紧在泰国—老挝边境的活动。
    据报道，泰国内政部以“防止泰老边境走私”为借口，在10月30日组织了一个“调查团”，前往接近老挝边境的廊开府。
    消息还透露，这个由乃沙立下令组成的“调查团”的成员，包括了内政部副常务次长坤那空、内地警察总指挥乃巴差和内政部政务督察专员乃巴颂等人。这个“调查团”将在廊开府设立“指挥部”，执行它的所谓“扫荡泰、老边境走私”的工作。
    另据曼谷报纸28日报道，泰国内政部派驻廊开府的“边境委员会”最近还以对付所谓老挝政府的“挑衅行动”为名，下令调动全部边境警察，在是昌迈县至挽干县沿湄公河一带进行布防。
