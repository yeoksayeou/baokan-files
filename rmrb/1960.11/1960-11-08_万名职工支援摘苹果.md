Ten Thousand Workers Support Apple Picking

Gaiping County, Liaoning, China's famous apple-producing area, has had a very good apple harvest this year.

This year, the Liaodong Peninsula suffered a severe typhoon disaster, but thanks to the full utilization of the strength of the people's communes, the good growth of apples was finally guaranteed.

In order to bring back all the abundant fruits in time, Gaiping County's various organs and enterprises have dispatched more than 10,000 workers to support the unloading of fruits in various communes, accelerating the picking progress. In order to do a good job in the unloading, loading, transportation, and delivery of apples, the Gaiping County Party Committee, headed by the First Secretary, has established a leading group to lead the apple harvesting and sales work.

    万名职工支援摘苹果
    我国著名的苹果产区，辽宁盖平县，今年苹果获得了很好的收成。
    今年辽东半岛遭受特大的风灾，由于充分发挥人民公社的力量，终于保证了苹果生长良好。
    为了把丰收的果实全部及时地采摘回来，盖平县各机关、企业抽出了一万多名职工到各公社支援卸果，加快了采摘进度。为了做好苹果的卸、装、运、发工作，盖平县委以第一书记挂帅成立了领导小组，领导苹果的收获和交售工作。（附图片）
