Artistic Flowers from Northern Europe
Liu Zhang (text), Li Keyu (sketch)

The Royal Swedish Opera Ballet, invited to our country for a friendly performance tour, has come from distant Stockholm to our capital and given wonderful and moving performances. Our people and artists greeted the friends from afar with warm hospitality and flowers.

In the past few days, the dazzling dance art of the Swedish dance artists has won praise and acclaim from the audience. Among them, the classical ballet dances performed by the dance troupe are even more thought-provoking. The piano played soft, light, and lyrical Chopin waltzes, and the one-act ballet "Les Sylphides" led the audience into a dreamlike world. Under the fluorescent mercury lamps, a group of young girls appeared quietly. Light tulle, delicate tiptoe movements, and graceful dance postures, accompanied by the waltz music, were like floating white clouds. And the pas de deux from Minkus' ballet "Don Quixote" aroused the enthusiasm of the audience. Fiery red skirts, fervent emotions, rapid rotations, and complex lifts all won continuous applause from the audience. The ballet dancers also performed the second act of Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake," Saint-Saëns' "The Dying Swan," the "Bluebird" pas de deux from "Sleeping Beauty," and excerpts from Adam's "Giselle." These classical-style ballets all left unforgettable impressions on the audience in the capital.

What is also worth mentioning is the ballet "The Prodigal Son," adapted from five classical folk paintings of biblical stories from Dalarna. The ballet tells the story of a vineyard owner's imaginative son who, tired of the monotonous work in the vineyard, is led astray by false prophets. The hardships of life make this remorseful son return home, where his father welcomes the prodigal son with open arms. The ballet uses classical ballet and Swedish folk dance, and the dance troupe has done a good job of integrating these elements, making the audience feel very familiar.

The Royal Swedish Opera Ballet has a history of more than two hundred years and possesses talented and experienced ballet choreographers and artistic directors such as Ms. Mary Skeaping, as well as dancers Orlando, Bodifeux, Shelin, Rodin, Lash, Claussen, Grevfberg, Sigrun, Ferribelli... Their rigorous artistic style and adherence to the art developed by classical ballet are worthy of our learning. The Royal Swedish Opera Ballet has successfully concluded its performances in the capital. Their performances have helped Chinese audiences to learn more about Swedish dance art and enhanced the friendship between the two peoples. We sincerely wish them even more brilliant achievements in their performances in other cities in our country. (Attached pictures)

    来自北欧的艺术之花
    刘章文　李克瑜速写
    应邀来我国作友好访问演出的瑞典皇家歌剧院芭蕾舞团，从遥远的斯德哥尔摩来到了我国的首都，作了精彩动人的演出。我国人民和艺术家们用盛情和鲜花迎接了远方来的朋友们。
    几天来，瑞典舞蹈艺术家们的绚丽多采的舞蹈艺术，博得了观众的赞扬和好评。其中更耐人寻味的是舞剧团演出的古典芭蕾舞蹈。钢琴奏出了柔和轻快抒情的萧邦舞曲，独幕舞剧《仙女们》把观众引向一个梦幻的世界，萤色水银灯下，静恬恬的出现一群少女。轻盈的细纱、细碎的足尖移动和娴静的舞姿，在华尔兹舞曲的伴奏下像是朵朵飘动的白云。而明库斯的舞剧《唐·吉呵德》中的双人舞，又激起了观众的热情。火红的纱裙，炽烈的情感，急剧的旋转和复杂的托举都赢得了观众的不断掌声。舞剧演员们还演出了柴可夫斯基《天鹅湖》中的第二幕，圣桑的《天鹅之死》，睡美人中的《蓝鸟》和《大步双人舞》，亚当的《吉赛尔》中的片断。这些古典风格的芭蕾舞都给首都观众留下了难忘的印象。
    还值得我们提起的是根据达拉那的五幅圣经故事古典民间绘画编成的舞剧《浪子》。舞剧中叙述了一个葡萄园主的富于幻想的儿子，厌烦了葡萄园的单调工作，由于假预言家的诱惑走入了歧途，艰难的日子使得这悔怨交加的儿子又回到了家中，父亲张开了双臂迎接回头的浪子。舞剧中运用了古典芭蕾和瑞典的民间舞，在这方面舞剧团做了较好的接合，使得观众感到很亲切。
    瑞典皇家歌剧院芭蕾舞团有着二百多年历史，又拥有有才华和丰富经验的芭蕾舞剧编导和艺术指导玛·史吉平先生和奥兰多、波地费克斯、雪林、罗丁、拉许、克劳夫逊、格雷夫堡、西格伦、费里贝利……舞蹈家。他们的严谨的艺术作风和遵循着古典芭蕾舞所发展的艺术，是值得我们学习的。瑞典皇家歌剧院芭蕾舞团已经成功地结束了在首都的演出，他们的演出，帮助中国观众更多地了解瑞典的舞蹈艺术，增进了两国人民之间的友谊。我们挚诚的预祝他们在我国其他各城市的演出中获得更辉煌的成绩。（附图片）
