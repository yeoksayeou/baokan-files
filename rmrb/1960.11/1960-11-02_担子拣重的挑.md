    Choose the Heavy Burden
    Fang Yun
    I am deeply moved by the deeds of the many heroes and model workers published in the newspapers. Their touching images and noble character stay with me, and thinking of them increases my courage and confidence in my work. Whenever difficulties arise and I feel apprehensive, I tell myself: "Look at the example of the heroes, how can you hesitate and not be worthy of being a revolutionary?" Then, I regain my courage and strive forward.
    The glorious images of Huang Jiguang and Dong Cunrui flash before my eyes. In that critical moment, to ensure the victory of the battle and reduce the casualties of their comrades, they used their bodies to block the enemy's machine guns and destroy the enemy's bunkers, without the slightest hesitation to sacrifice their lives. The touching images of thousands of model workers on the industrial and agricultural fronts also flash before my eyes. How much brainpower did they rack, how many sleepless nights did they spend, to overcome a difficulty and complete an invention? Take the model worker Ma Xueli, for example; his spirit of "step up when encountering difficulties, yield when encountering honor, learn from the advanced, and help the backward" has moved and educated so many people! The images of many veteran revolutionaries also flash before my eyes. In the hard years of the revolution, they experienced hundreds of battles and endured countless hardships, and now they are leading the way and going down to the agricultural front, the place most needed by the Party, to sow, take root, blossom, and bear fruit. The respected images of the younger generation also flash before my eyes, like Xing Yanzi. This girl is not afraid of hardship, loves the countryside, loves the collective, and leads young people to participate in agricultural production. She has become a role model for thousands of young people. Many young people are determined to be "Yanzi-style" "silly girls" and have already rushed to the agricultural front.
    There are hundreds and thousands of touching hero images, too many to name. Although the deeds of the heroes are different, the true qualities of the heroes are the same. That is: go wherever it is difficult, and pick up the heavy burden.
      "Choose the heavy burden," this is what Chairman Mao earnestly taught us. Chairman Mao said: "Difficult work is like a burden placed before us to see if we dare to shoulder it. Some burdens are light, some are heavy. Some people pick the light ones and fear the heavy ones, pushing the heavy burdens to others and picking the light ones for themselves. This is not a good attitude. Some comrades are not like this. They yield enjoyment to others, pick the heavy burdens, endure hardship before others, and enjoy after others. Such comrades are good comrades. We should all learn this communist spirit." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, page 1160)
    The heroes and model workers who are respected and loved by the people and have become role models for everyone are precisely the communists Chairman Mao spoke of, and precisely the people who dare to pick up heavy burdens cultivated and fostered by Chairman Mao. In the years of revolutionary war, in every battle, we saw many companies vying to take on the main attack or the most arduous task. This is choosing the heavy burden. Now, on the industrial and agricultural production fronts, many people are courageous in innovation and creation, courageous in tackling key problems, and solving the most critical problems in production. This is also choosing the heavy burden. Running agriculture in a big way and running grain in a big way is also a heavy burden. The Party calls on us to go to the forefront of agriculture and take up this burden. Now, millions of cadres and young people are enthusiastically responding to the Party's call and rushing to the forefront of agricultural production. They regard picking up heavy burdens as an honor and have made great vows to make a career in the countryside.
    To draw the newest and most beautiful picture on the "poor and blank" base, this burden is not light. However, with the spirit of choosing the heavy burden, how can we fear the stubborn rocks of poverty and blankness will not bow their heads?

    担子拣重的挑
    方云
    我为报纸上刊载的许许多多英雄模范的事迹深深感动。他们的动人形象，他们的高贵品格，使我久久不忘，一想起他们，就增加了我工作的勇气和信心。每当困难来到而我心里又有所畏惧的时候，我就对自己说：“看看英雄们的榜样吧，你这样踌躇不前，配做一个革命者么？”于是，我又重新鼓足勇气，奋力前进。
    在我眼前闪过黄继光、董存瑞的光辉形象，他们为了保证战斗的胜利，减少战友的伤亡，在那千钧一发之际，用自己的身体去堵塞敌人的机枪，去炸毁敌人的碉堡，而丝毫不吝惜自己的生命。在我眼前也闪过千百个工农业战线上劳动模范的动人的形象，他们为了攻克一个关隘，完成一项发明创造，绞尽了多少脑汁，度过了多少个不眠之夜。就拿劳动模范马学礼来说吧，他那“见困难就上，见荣誉就让，见先进就学，见后进就帮”的精神，就曾经和正在使多少人受到感动和受到教育啊！在我眼前也闪过许多革命老战士的形象，他们在革命艰苦的岁月里，身经百战，历尽千辛万苦，而现在又身先士卒下放到党最需要的地方——农业战线上去，在那儿播种，生根，开花，结果。在我眼前也闪过年青一代的受人尊敬的形象，就说邢燕子吧，这个姑娘，不怕艰苦，热爱农村，热爱集体，带动青年参加农业生产。她，成了千千万万青年学习的榜样，许多青年都立志要做一个“燕子式”的“傻丫头”，而且已经奔赴到农业前线去了。
    动人的英雄形象成百上千，说也说不完，英雄们的事迹尽管不同，而英雄们的本色却是一样。那就是：那里艰苦，就到那里去，那个担子重，就把重的挑起来。
      “担子拣重的挑”，这是毛主席谆谆教导我们的。毛主席说：“艰苦的工作就像担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷一一六○页）
    受人民尊敬、爱戴，成为大家学习榜样的英雄模范们，正是毛主席所说的这种共产主义者，正是毛主席所教育和培养出来的敢于拣重担子挑的人。在革命战争的年代，在每一次战斗里，我们看到许多连队都抢着要担任主攻，或者担任最艰巨的任务，这就是担子拣重的挑。在现在，在工农业生产战线上，许多人勇于革新创造，勇于攻关，去解决生产中最关紧要的问题，这也是担子拣重的挑。大办农业，大办粮食，也是一副重的担子，党号召我们到农业第一线去，把这副担子挑起来。现在数以百万计的干部、青年热烈响应党的号召奔赴农业生产第一线，他们以挑重担子为荣，立下宏伟志愿，要在农村干出一番事业。
    要在“一穷二白”的基地上画出最新最美的画图，这副担子本来就不轻。但是，我们有着担子拣重的挑的精神，穷、白这两块顽石，那怕它不低头？
