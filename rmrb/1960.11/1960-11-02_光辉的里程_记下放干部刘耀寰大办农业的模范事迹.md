A Glorious Journey
——Recording the Model Deeds of Cadre Liu Yaohuan in Vigorously Developing Agriculture
Xinhua News Agency reporter Yao Yange, Guangxi Daily reporter Xiang Jiasong

In Gumaoyao and along the Longjiang River in Luocheng County, Guangxi, two folk songs are widely circulated:

“The more you count the stars, the more stars there are,
The secretary's good deeds are piled up like baskets,
The old folks tell it as a story,
The children sing it as a mountain song.”

“We don't sing of past dynasties,
Only sing of the Party's good policies,
A good cadre, both literate and skilled,
The understanding secretary, Liu Yaohuan.”

This "understanding secretary" praised by the people is Liu Yaohuan, a cadre transferred from the Supervision Committee of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China and the first secretary of the Tianhe Commune Party Committee.

For more than two years, Liu Yaohuan has taken root in the countryside, worked diligently, and the commune he led has received twenty-one awards from the autonomous region, the special district, and the county, becoming a successful commune in the special district and the county. Liu Yaohuan was named a model among commune party committee secretaries in the county and has received seven awards from the autonomous region, the special district, and the county, becoming a shining example for cadres transferred to the agricultural front.

Taking Root in the Countryside

In the winter of 1957, Liu Yaohuan responded to the Party's call and moved from Nanning to Luocheng County, settling down in the county. He successively served as the Party Committee Secretary in Xiangbei, Qiaoshan, and Tianhe Communes. Before being transferred to work in Nanning in 1953, he had served as a district party secretary in the countryside, leading farmers in land reform and organizing mutual aid teams. Thinking of that passionate rural life in the past, he was infinitely longing for it. Therefore, when he left Nanning, he was determined to contribute to the construction of a new countryside.

When he was transferred, the countryside was launching a production upsurge centered on water conservancy. As soon as he arrived at the commune, he ate, lived, and worked with the commune members. Initially, the commune members did not know much about him. Once, when he went to harrow the fields, female commune member Wei Yuying glanced at his blue uniform and said with disbelief, "Are you here to harrow the fields?"

"Yes!" Liu Yaohuan said. He rolled up his trouser legs and jumped into the field, using the ox to harrow the field in mud deeper than half his knees. Wei Yuying saw that although he didn't harrow very well, he was covered in sweat and mud. She sincerely admired him, poured a bowl of boiled water and placed it at the edge of the field, and snatched the plow, saying, "Secretary! Have a drink of water and rest!"

The commune members saw that Liu Yaohuan could handle any job, light or heavy, and was as close to them as a brother, without any airs. They were all happy to be close to him. Whenever commune members talked about him, they said affectionately, "Our Secretary Liu is really a good cadre nurtured by the Party and Chairman Mao!"

The "Elementary School Student" of the Masses

Liu Yaohuan had been working in government offices for a long time and was unfamiliar with agricultural production techniques and rural work. When he plunged into the new countryside of the Great Leap Forward, he encountered many difficulties.

In 1958, he relied on his full enthusiasm in Qiaoshan Commune and planted one mu of densely planted experimental high-yield field. Although he moved to the field to sleep and worked hard for half a year, the seedlings only grew leaves but no ears because they were planted too densely and he did not know how to fertilize and take care of them. They all fell and rotted. At that time, commune members criticized him: "If everyone does production like you, we won't even have enough to eat. In the future, if you want to do anything, it's best to ask everyone first."

The commune member's words inspired him greatly. He realized that leading production without understanding production would only mess things up. In the future, he had to honestly be an elementary school student of the masses and delve into production. From then on, he decided to learn all kinds of agricultural knowledge and techniques from the masses and learn methods of leading production from grassroots cadres. Every day, he went to the fields with the commune members to work, harvesting rice, threshing, plowing, harrowing, transplanting rice seedlings, and applying fertilizer, learning while doing, and doing while learning. He plowed the fields with the commune members. In the beginning, the ox always disobeyed. He asked the old farmer Wu Xiuhua for advice. Wu Xiuhua told him that his problem was that he didn't know how to use the ox and showed Liu Yaohuan how to do it. Liu Yaohuan carefully studied his plowing method and memorized every action. At night, he took the ox and carried the plow to the field alone, learning to plow under the stars. This is how he seriously learned all kinds of agricultural knowledge and techniques from the old farmers and commune members.

An Outstanding Leader

When Tianhe Commune comprehensively carried out the rush harvesting and planting this summer, the progress of plowing was very slow. Liu Yaohuan decided to lead everyone to carry out a competition to speed up the plowing progress.

There was a squad leader in Longjiang Brigade named Liao Xiande, who was a well-known plowing pacesetter in the county. Liu Yaohuan decided to compete with him. After hearing this, Liao Xiande patted Liu Yaohuan on the shoulder and laughed, "Secretary Liu! You want to compete with me in plowing, look at my head! I have been doing this job for so long that my hair is almost white. You will definitely not be able to beat me!" The commune members also said that not only could Liu Yaohuan not beat Liao Xiande, but no one in the entire team could beat him. But Liu Yaohuan insisted on competing with him.

The next day, before dawn, Liu Yaohuan and Liao Xiande both carried plows and led oxen to the field. The commune members of the team also came early to watch the competition. The intense competition began. Liao Xiande and Liu Yaohuan worked hard non-stop, competing fiercely. The commune members watching from the sidelines also acted, and everyone was involved in the plowing competition. When they checked at breakfast, Liu Yaohuan had plowed 4.2 mu, and Liao Xiande had plowed 3.1 mu. This matter quickly spread. All five brigades, sixty-eight teams, and eighty-seven work groups in the commune, more than two thousand commune members, participated in the competition movement. As a result, the speed of "double rush" continued to increase, and the task was completed seven days ahead of schedule.

In every production movement, Liu Yaohuan always led by example, driving the masses forward. He often carried a dung basket and hoe, going to all parts of the commune to check the growth of rice seedlings. Wherever there were difficulties in work, he immediately went there to solve them. He could tell the area, soil quality, and types of crops planted in each paddy field on the more than 7,000 mu of cultivated land in the commune. He knew the production situation of the entire commune like the back of his hand.

Building a More Prosperous Commune

Tianhe Commune has little land and a large population. Although grain output has increased year after year, before 1958, the state still had to supply 470,000 jin of grain every year.

As soon as Liu Yaohuan arrived at Tianhe Commune, he established the principle of running the commune: diligent and thrifty, working hard, not taking state loans, and relying on the strength of the masses to completely change the backwardness of Tianhe.

However, the commune did not have much land. Even if both early and late rice crops and corn were harvested abundantly, the grain problem could not be completely solved. What to do? He decided to ask the masses for advice. One morning, he talked about this matter with several old commune members while working together. Old commune member Mo Xuean suggested that in addition to focusing on water, fertilizer, and seeds, they should also focus on the land. This sentence greatly inspired him. After breakfast, he gathered six experienced old farmers and discussed this issue in the field.

At the meeting, old farmer Li Shunde suggested intercropping and cited an example: Last year, the Weixin Brigade intercropped buckwheat in two mu of early cornfield, harvested buckwheat to plant sweet potatoes, harvested the first spring crop to plant the second spring crop, and harvested corn and sweet potatoes to plant winter wheat. They harvested five crops a year, totaling more than 2,400 jin, which was more than 210 jin more than one mu of two crops. Old farmer Zhang Fugang also told him that paddy fields can also produce three crops. A few remote fields harvested early rice and transplanted secondary rice seedlings last year, harvested secondary rice seedlings to plant rapeseed, and harvested at least 100 jin more per mu. If sweet potatoes were planted after harvesting early rice and barley was plowed after harvesting sweet potatoes, at least 100 jin more could be harvested per mu.

From this old farmer forum, Liu Yaohuan affirmed that vigorously engaging in intercropping and catch cropping, striving for multiple harvests a year, was the way to seize more grain. He and the commune's cadres went to the Weixin Brigade to summarize the experience of multiple harvests a year. After returning to the commune, he convened a Party committee meeting and a meeting of cadres above the level of small team leader, proposing to vigorously engage in intercropping, catch cropping, and multiple cropping to strive for higher yields. After discussion by the commune members, this measure was implemented. On more than 7,600 mu of cultivated land, intercropping, multiple cropping, and catch cropping methods were adopted, and a total of more than 23,100 mu of early, middle, and late rice, spring, autumn, and winter corn, soybeans, peanuts, sweet potatoes, buckwheat, and wheat crops were planted, realizing four crops a year on swidden land and three crops a year on paddy fields, increasing the land utilization rate by 215%.

For more than two years since his transfer, Liu Yaohuan has been diligent and thrifty, pragmatic and thorough, leading by example in everything, closely contacting the masses, and leading the cadres and commune members of the entire commune with soaring enthusiasm and selfless revolutionary spirit, working hard to overcome disasters and achieve continuous bumper harvests. Now Tianhe Commune has not only ended the history of asking the state for grain every year, but also provided a large amount of grain to the state. Last year, all five brigades and sixty-four production teams in the commune exceeded the contracted output, and the total annual grain output reached 5,030,000 jin, an increase of 30.2% compared to the Great Leap Forward in 1958. Although there was a severe drought in the first half of this year, grain production still increased compared to last year. In addition to leaving enough grain for rations, seeds, and feed, 80.5% of the annual grain procurement task was completed in one season.

    光辉的里程
    ——记下放干部刘耀寰大办农业的模范事迹
    新华社记者  姚燕戈  广西日报记者  向家松
    在广西罗城县古毛坳、龙江河畔，到处流传着这样两首山歌：
    “天星越数星越多，
    书记好处箩排箩，
    老人当做故事讲，
    小孩拿来唱山歌。”
      “不唱前朝与后代，
    只唱党的好主张，
    能文能武好干部，
    知心书记刘耀寰。”
    人们颂扬的这个“知心书记”，就是中共广西僮族自治区委员会监察委员会的下放干部、天河公社党委第一书记刘耀寰。
    两年多来，刘耀寰在农村中落足生根，埋头苦干，他领导的公社，先后受到自治区、专区和县的二十一次奖励，成为专区和县的满堂红公社。刘耀寰被评为全县公社党委书记的标兵，先后获得了自治区、专区、县的七次奖励，成为农业战线上下放干部的光辉榜样。
    在农村落足生根
    1957年冬，刘耀寰响应党的号召，从南宁来到罗城县安家落户，先后在祥贝、乔善、天河三个公社担任党委书记。1953年他调到南宁工作前，曾在农村当过区委书记，领导过农民搞土改、组织互助组。一想到过去那段火热的农村生活，他就无限向往。因此，他在离开南宁时就决心要为建设新农村贡献力量。
    他下放时，农村正掀起以水利为中心的生产高潮。他一到公社，就和社员们同吃同住同劳动。开始时，社员们对他还不了解，有一次他去耙田，女社员韦玉英瞅了瞅他穿的那身蓝制服，不大相信地说：“你是来耙田吗？”
      “是呀！”刘耀寰说。他把裤腿一卷，便跳下田在深过半膝的泥浆里，一脚低一脚高地使牛耙起田来。韦玉英看他虽然耙得不太好，但是满头大汗，泥浆溅了满身，心里对他实在敬佩，她倒了一碗开水放在田头，一把抢过犁耙，说：“书记！你喝口水休息休息吧！”
    社员们看到刘耀寰无论轻的重的，什么活都拿得上手、挑得上肩，和社员亲如兄弟，没有一点架子，都欢喜和他接近。社员们一谈起他来就亲切地说：“我们这个刘书记，真是党和毛主席教养出来的好干部！”
      群众的“小学生”
    刘耀寰长期离开农村搞机关工作，农业生产技术和农村工作都陌生了，一投入大跃进的新农村，就遇到许多困难。
    1958年，他在乔善公社凭着满腔热情，种了一亩蔸靠蔸的密植丰产试验田。他虽然搬到田头睡觉，辛辛苦苦忙了半年，但由于种得太密，而且不懂得怎样施肥护理，禾苗只长叶不长穗，都倒伏烂死了。当时，社员批评他：“都像你这样搞生产，连饭都吃不上，以后，你们想搞什么，最好先问问大家。”
    社员的话使他受到很大启发，他认识到，不懂生产要领导生产，只会把事情办糟，今后得老老实实当群众的小学生，钻进生产里去。从此，他决心向群众学习各种农业知识和技术，向基层干部学习领导生产的方法。每天跟社员一起到地里劳动，割禾、打谷、犁田、耙田、插秧、追肥，边作边学，边学边作。他和社员们到地里一起犁田，开始时牛总是不听使唤。他就向老农吴秀华请教，吴秀华告诉他，他犁田的毛病是不会使牛，并且做出样子给刘耀寰看。刘耀寰跟着细心研究了他的犁法，把每一个动作都记下了。晚上，他就一个人牵了牛扛着犁，到地里顶着星星学犁田。他就是这样认真地从老农和社员身上学到了各种农业知识和技术。
        出色的带头人
    今年夏天天河公社全面开展抢收抢种的时候，犁田的进度很慢。刘耀寰决定带动大家开展竞赛，来加快犁田进度。
    龙江大队有一个小队长叫廖显德，是全县有名的犁田标兵。刘耀寰决定和他比赛。廖显德听说后，拍拍刘耀寰的肩膀呵呵大笑说：“刘书记呀！你要和我赛犁田，你看我的脑袋吧！我干这门活，头发都快白了，你是一定赛不过我的！”社员们也说，不但刘耀寰赛不过廖显德，全队的人都赛不过他。但是刘耀寰却一定要和他比。
    第二天天不亮，刘耀寰和廖显德都扛犁牵牛来到了地里，队里的社员也一早来看比赛。紧张的竞赛开始了，廖显德和刘耀寰都不停歇地猛干，赛得十分火热，一旁看着的社员们也都纷纷行动起来，人人都卷进了犁田的大竞赛。早饭时验收，刘耀寰犁了四亩二，廖显德犁了三亩一。这件事很快就传开了。全社五个大队、六十八个小队、八十七个作业组，二千多个社员，都投入了竞赛运动，结果“双抢”速度不断上升，提前七天完成了任务。
    刘耀寰在每一个生产运动中，总是以身作则，带动群众前进。他常常背着粪箕、锄头，到全社各地检查禾苗生长的情况，那里工作有困难，就立即到那里去解决。他能说出全社七千多亩耕地上每块回垌的面积、土质和种植作物的种类，对全社的生产情况如数家珍，了如指掌。把公社建设得更加富裕
    天河公社地少人多，粮食产量虽然连年提高，但1958年以前每年仍要国家供应四十七万斤粮食。
    刘耀寰一到天河公社，就确定了办社的原则：克勤克俭，埋头苦干，不要国家贷款，依靠群众的力量来彻底改变天河的落后面貌。
    但是，全社的地不多，就算早晚两造水稻和玉米都丰收，粮食问题也不能彻底解决。怎么办？他决定去向群众请教。有天一早，他和几个老社员一起劳动的时候谈起了这件事，老社员莫学安提出，除了在水、肥、种子等上面作文章外，还要在地上打主意。这句话使他受到很大启发，早饭后，他找来六个有经验的老农在田头一道商量这个问题。
    老农李顺德在会上向他提出了间种的办法，并且举例说，去年维新大队在二亩早玉米地里间种荞麦，打下荞麦种红薯，收完头春种二春，刈完玉米红薯种冬麦，一年五熟，共收了二千四百多斤，比两熟的一亩多打二百一十斤。老农张福刚又告诉他水田也能三熟，有几亩边远田去年收完早造插二苗，刈完二苗种油菜，一亩也多收百来斤，如果早稻收下后种红薯，犁完红薯种大麦，一亩还可以起码多收一百斤。
    刘耀寰从这个老农座谈会上，肯定了大搞间种、套种，力争一年多熟是夺取更多粮食的途径。他便和社里的干部到维新大队里把一年多熟的经验进行了总结。回到公社后便召开党委会和小队长以上干部会，提出要大搞间种、套种、复种，争取更高产量。经过社员讨论，这个措施贯彻执行了。在七千六百多亩耕地上，采取间种、复种、套种办法，共种上早、中、晚稻，春、秋、冬玉米和黄豆、花生、红薯、荞麦、大小麦等作物二万三千一百多亩，实现了畲地一年四熟，水田一年三熟，使土地利用率提高了215％。
    刘耀寰下放两年多来，就是这样勤劳俭朴、踏实深入、事事带头、密切联系群众，以冲天的干劲和忘我的革命精神，带动全社干部和社员，发愤图强，战胜了灾害，夺得了连年丰收。现在天河公社不仅结束了年年向国家要粮的历史，而且为国家提供了大量粮食。去年，全社五个大队、六十四个生产队，实现了队队超包产，全年粮食总产量达五百零三万斤，比大跃进的1958年还增产30.2％。今年上半年虽然遇到大旱，但粮食仍然比去年增产，除了留足口粮、种子、饲料外，一季就完成了全年粮食征购任务的80.5％。
