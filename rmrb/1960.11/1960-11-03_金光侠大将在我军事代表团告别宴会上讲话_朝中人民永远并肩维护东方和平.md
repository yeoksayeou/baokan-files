Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd - Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense of North Korea, General Kim Kwang-hyup's speech at the farewell banquet held for the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to North Korea is as follows in full: Respected Comrade He Long! Respected Comrade Luo Ruiqing! Dear comrades, members of the Military Friendship Delegation! Comrades!
    The visit of the People's Republic of China Military Friendship Delegation headed by the esteemed Comrade He Long to our country has aroused great joy among the people and officers and soldiers of our People's Army.
    During your stay in our country, you have felt the love and friendship of our people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army everywhere you have gone. You will be warmly welcomed wherever you visit.
    This is precisely the manifestation of the unwavering friendship of our people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army towards the Chinese people and their army.
    Your visit infinitely inspires the struggle of our people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army for socialist construction and the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and makes a great contribution to further strengthening the friendship between the peoples and armies of our two countries. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to all comrades of the Military Friendship Delegation of the People's Republic of China, our closest comrades-in-arms, for their friendly visit to our country.
    The friendship and solidarity between the peoples and armies of Korea and China were forged in the historical process of a long and arduous struggle against imperialism, and have been consolidated and developed through severe trials of struggle.
    This traditional friendship and cooperative relationship grew into an even more unbreakable force during our Fatherland Liberation War against the common enemy, the US imperialist aggressors; today, in the common struggle for socialist construction and safeguarding peace in the Far East, it has been further consolidated and developed.
    We are confident that this great friendship will make a great contribution to the prosperity and strength of our two countries and to the victory of the great cause of peace and socialism.
    Today, the ringleader of the world's reactionary forces, the US imperialist aggressors, still occupy the southern half of our fatherland and Taiwan, an inseparable territory of the People's Republic of China, and are frantically struggling to launch heinous wars of aggression in Asia and around the world. However, no war provocation by the enemy can threaten us, let alone defeat our united and great strength.
    The rapid growth of the revolutionary forces of our two countries and the strengthening of the internationalist friendship and solidarity between the peoples of our two countries are a powerful force in stopping the provocations and conspiracies of the US imperialist aggressors in the Far East.
    Our people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army, in the great family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will always advance shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people and their army, and under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, will hold high the banner of proletarian internationalism. In order to safeguard peace in the East and the cause of socialism, we will continue to wage a resolute struggle against the US imperialist aggressors.
    I wish the great Chinese people, who are constantly making great leaps forward under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong to accomplish the great cause of socialism, and their defenders, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, greater achievements in their sacred struggle.
    Comrades!
    You will be returning home after a few more days in our country. I wish you good health, and I hope that you will convey the love and friendly feelings of our people and the officers and soldiers of the People's Army to the Chinese people and the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army after you return home.
    I propose a toast:
    To the eternal friendship and unity between the peoples and armies of Korea and China,
    To the indestructible unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union,
    To the health of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Government of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong,
    To the health of Comrade He Long and Comrade Luo Ruiqing and all the comrades of the Military Friendship Delegation,
    To the health of all comrades present,
    Cheers!

    金光侠大将在我军事代表团告别宴会上讲话
    朝中人民永远并肩维护东方和平
    新华社平壤2日电　朝鲜内阁副首相兼民族保卫相金光侠大将在中国访朝军事友好代表团举行的告别宴会上的讲话，全文如下：尊敬的贺龙同志！尊敬的罗瑞卿同志！亲爱的军事友好代表团全体团员同志们！同志们！
    以尊敬的贺龙同志为团长的中华人民共和国军事友好代表团在我国的访问，激起了我国人民和人民军官兵们的极大的喜悦。
    你们在逗留我国的期间，每到一处都感到了我国人民和人民军官兵们对你们的热爱和友谊的情意，你们将要访问的每一处也会受到我国人民和人民军官兵的热烈欢迎。
    这正是我国人民和人民军官兵对中国人民及其军队的坚定不移的友好情意的表现。
    你们的访问无限地鼓舞着我国人民和人民军官兵为建设社会主义和和平统一祖国而进行的斗争，并且对进一步加强我们两国人民及其军队之间的友谊做出巨大的贡献。我借此机会谨向来我国友好访问的我们最亲密的战友——中华人民共和国军事友好代表团各位同志致以深深的感谢。
    朝中两国人民及其军队之间的友谊团结，是在反对帝国主义的长期的艰苦斗争的历史过程中结成的，是通过严峻的斗争考验得到了巩固和发展的。
    这一传统友谊和互相合作关系，在我们反对共同敌人——美帝国主义侵略者的祖国解放战争时期，壮大成了更加牢不可破的力量；今天在社会主义建设和维护远东和平的共同斗争中，得到了进一步的巩固和发展。
    我们确信，这一伟大的友谊，对我们两国的富强繁荣，对和平和社会主义的伟大事业的胜利将作出巨大的贡献。
    世界反动势力的元凶——美帝国主义侵略者今天还强占着我们祖国的南半部和中华人民共和国不可分割的领土——台湾，并在亚洲和世界各处为发动凶恶的侵略战争而疯狂地挣扎着。但是，敌人的任何战争挑衅也绝不能威胁我们，更不能战胜我们团结一致的伟大力量。
    我们两国革命力量的迅速壮大和两国人民之间的国际主义友谊团结的增强，是在远东制止美帝国主义侵略者的挑衅和阴谋的强大力量。
    我国人民和人民军官兵在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中，将永远同兄弟般的中国人民及其军队并肩前进，并在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的领导下，高举无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，为维护东方的和平和社会主义事业，将继续同美帝国主义侵略者进行坚决的斗争。
    我谨祝在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，为完成社会主义伟大事业而不断大跃进着的伟大的中国人民及其保卫者——中国人民解放军官兵们，在神圣的斗争中取得更大的成就。
    同志们！
    你们在我国再逗留几天就要回国了，预祝你们健康，并希望你们回国以后转达我国人民和人民军官兵对中国人民和中国人民解放军官兵们的热爱和友好的感情。
    我提议：
    为朝中两国人民及其军队之间的永恒的友谊和团结，
    为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营牢不可破的统一团结，
    为以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府各位领导同志的健康，
    为贺龙同志和罗瑞卿同志以及军事友好代表团全体同志的健康，
    为在座的各位同志的健康，
    干杯！（附图片）
