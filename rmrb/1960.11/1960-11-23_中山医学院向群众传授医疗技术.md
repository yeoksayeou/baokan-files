Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 22nd: Shenyang Agricultural College has dispatched over four thousand teachers and students from eighteen specialties to the countryside in batches this year, providing comprehensive support for agricultural technical transformation.

As early as 1958, this college established a connection with the Gaokan People's Commune in the suburbs of Shenyang. This year, it further developed this connection to Tie嶺 and Kangping counties, undertaking to solve the production technology problems of the communes in the two counties. The teachers and students dispatched to Tie嶺 County, under the unified leadership of the county party committee, formed six specialized groups, including cultivation technology, agricultural machinery, and water conservancy and electricity. They assisted the county party committee in conducting surveys and analyses of soil, fertilizer, seeds, and plant protection, drawing "Soil Distribution," "Dryland Rotation," and "Groundwater Level Contour" maps, and formulated a "Water Conservancy Plan," "Land Consolidation Plan," and more than ten kinds of high-yield technical measures for crops. The teachers and students of the Plant Protection Department assisted the county party committee in establishing a mass-based pest and disease forecasting network throughout the county, formulating prevention and control measures for major pests and diseases, and controlling the damage caused by more than twenty major pests and diseases. The teachers and students of the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Department adopted indigenous methods and a combination of indigenous and foreign techniques to create and modify twenty-seven kinds of machines, such as corn planters, vegetable ditching machines, and vegetable harvesting machines, increasing work efficiency by two to ten times respectively. They also successfully trial-produced eight kinds of indigenous equipment for repairing tractors and agricultural implements, which have been promoted in various communes and farms.

In order to ensure that agricultural technology takes root locally, the teachers and students also held more than 400 training classes and on-site meetings, training more than 40,000 agricultural technicians in various fields, and helped the communes establish six amateur agricultural science research institutes and part-work part-study agricultural middle schools.

This agricultural college's support for agricultural production is closely integrated with teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. They incorporate support for agriculture into the teaching plan, and students from all departments go to the countryside to participate in productive labor according to the plan, combining labor with teaching practice and production practice. Teachers from all departments also go to the countryside in batches, working while focusing on solving production problems to carry out scientific research. In the past, no one in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Department taught vegetable mechanization. Now, after investigation, design, and trial production, the teachers and students have selected a set of agricultural machinery suitable for vegetable production in China, which not only supports vegetable production but also opens up new courses.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 22nd: Teachers and students of Zhongshan Medical College in Guangdong Province, focusing on protecting the health of the agricultural labor force, actively assist rural areas in carrying out medical and health work, improving the professional level of rural grassroots health workers, and conducting scientific research on major rural diseases, supporting agricultural production in many ways.

Since the last semester, this medical college has been connected with Zhongluotan and Taihe communes in the suburbs of Guangzhou, frequently sending teachers and students there to participate in agricultural labor and carry out medical and health work. Beginning in July this year, in accordance with the Party's directive to vigorously support agriculture in all walks of life, they have successively dispatched more than 100 teachers and students to form six medical teams, which went to six counties in the Shantou, Zhanjiang, and Foshan prefectures to participate in production while carrying out disease prevention and treatment work. In addition, the college has established a system of combining long-term and short-term assignments of medical personnel to the countryside, rotating all medical personnel to the countryside. Fifth-year students will also be assigned to county and commune grassroots medical units for graduation internships. After being assigned to the countryside, these teachers and students all went deep into the front line of production, adopting the method of working, propagating, preventing, and treating diseases at the same time, so as to treat diseases when there are diseases, prevent diseases when there are no diseases, and carry out the propagation of health knowledge. More than 20 teachers and students who went to Dongguan County, by working together with the masses, handed over medical technology to the masses, and within 20 days, they conducted a general survey of major diseases of women over the age of seventeen throughout the county.

The teachers and students who went to the countryside actively improved the professional level of rural health workers and grassroots health cadres by holding training classes, taking apprentices, holding academic reports, and going to grassroots medical units for consultations and surgical demonstrations.

    中山医学院向群众传授医疗技术
    新华社沈阳22日电　沈阳农学院今年已先后派出十八个专业的四千多名师生，把技术配套成龙地送到农村，全面支援农业技术改造。
    早在1958年，这个学院就和所在地沈阳市郊高坎人民公社挂了钩，今年又把这种挂钩关系发展到铁岭、康平两个县，把两县公社的生产技术问题包下来。派到铁岭县的师生，在县委统一领导下，组成栽培技术、农业机械、水利电气等六个专业组，协助县委进行土壤、肥料、种子、植物保护等方面的调查分析，绘制了“土壤分布”、“旱田轮作”、“地下水位等高线”等图谱，制订了“水利化规划”、“土地整理规划”以及十多种农作物的丰产技术措施。植物保护系师生协助县委在全县建立了群众性的病虫害预报网，制订主要病虫害防治措施，控制了二十多种主要病虫的为害。机电系师生采取土法上马、土洋结合的办法，创制与改制了玉米点播机、蔬菜打池子机、蔬菜收获机等二十七种机具，分别提高工效两倍到十倍。他们还试制成功八种修理拖拉机和农具的土设备，已经在各公社和农场推广。
    为了让农业技术就地扎根，师生们还举办训练班、现场会四百多次，培训各方面的农业技术人员四万多名，还帮助公社建立了六个业余农业科学研究所和半耕半读的农业中学。
    这个农学院的支援农业生产是密切结合教学、科学研究和生产劳动进行的。他们把支援农业纳入教学计划，各系学生都按计划下乡参加生产劳动，结合劳动进行教学实习和生产实习。各系教师也分批下乡，一边劳动，一边以解决生产问题为中心展开科学研究工作。过去，机电系无人开蔬菜机械化栽培这门课，现在师生们经过调查、设计、试制，已选定出一套适应我国蔬菜生产的农机具，不仅支援了蔬菜生产，也开出了新课。
    据新华社广州22日电　广东省中山医学院师生围绕着以保护农业劳动力的健康为中心，积极协助农村开展医疗卫生工作，提高农村基层卫生干部的业务水平，并且进行农村主要疾病的科学研究，从多方面支援农业生产。
    从上学期起，这个医学院就同广州市郊的钟落潭、太和公社挂了钩，经常派出师生到那里参加农业劳动和开展医疗卫生工作。今年7月份开始，他们根据党所提出各行各业大力支援农业的指示，又先后派出一百多名师生组成六个医疗队，分赴汕头、湛江、佛山专区的六个县去，一边参加生产，一边开展防治疾病工作。此外，学院建立了医务人员长期与短期相结合的下放制度，将全体医务人员轮流下放到农村。五年级学生也要下放到县、社基层医疗单位进行毕业实习。这些师生下放后，都深入到生产第一线去，采取边劳动、边宣传、边预防、边医疗的办法，做到有病治病、无病防病和开展卫生知识的宣传。到东莞县去工作的二十多名师生，通过和群众一起劳动，把医疗技术交给群众，二十天内就在全县进行了十七岁以上妇女的主要疾病的普查工作。
    下乡的师生，通过举办训练班、带徒弟和举办学术报告，以及到基层医疗单位会诊、作手术示范等方式，积极提高农村保健人员和基层卫生干部的业务水平。
