Sewing Cotton-Padded Clothes

One evening, Ma Yufa, the deputy director of the Third Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, returned home from work. As soon as he entered the door, the director of the neighborhood committee said to him, "Old Ma, our family members are really enthusiastic about supporting steel production. We held another meeting today, and everyone unanimously requested to make cotton-padded clothes for the single workers in our factory. Please contact the factory for us." Director Ma hurriedly said, "That's great, our factory happens to have a batch of work like that. I will have it sent to you tomorrow."

The next day, the factory sent cloth and cotton. Before the director could even notify them, the family members of the workers came one after another, and started working together. Three pieces for you, four pieces for her, and it was all divided up in less than ten minutes. The director insisted on keeping one piece, saying, "Don't take this one. The day before yesterday, I went to Aunt Wang Suqing's house, and she said that even though she is old, she also wants to fight for steel. If there is any work, send some to her. Let her make this piece of clothing, and don't let her old heart down."

Old Aunt Wang Suqing was very happy when she received the cloth and cotton. She made this cotton-padded garment carefully and meticulously, spreading the cotton evenly and sewing the stitches tightly. After finishing, the old aunt looked at the cotton-padded clothes she had made for the young steelworkers and muttered to herself, "This time, I can also contribute to steel."

In order to let the steelworkers wear cotton-padded clothes as soon as possible, the family members worked from dawn till dusk. In less than three days, they made more than one hundred pieces and handed them in ahead of schedule.

On the morning of October 25th, they braved the small north wind and delivered the finished cotton-padded clothes to the single workers' dormitory. When the workers put on the warm and well-fitting cotton-padded clothes, they said gratefully, "We must take the factory as our home and guarantee the completion of this year's steel production task to repay the Party's care and the family members' support."

    缝棉衣
    一天晚上，鞍山钢铁公司第三炼钢厂副厂长马玉发下班回家，刚进门，居民委员会主任就对他说：“老马呀，咱们家属支援钢铁生产的劲头可足了，今天又开了个会，大家一致要求给咱厂独身职工做棉衣，你给咱联系一下吧。”马厂长忙说：“那太好了，咱们厂子正好有这么一批活，明天就给你们送来。”
    第二天，厂里派人把布和棉花送来了。还没等主任通知，职工家属们就都闻风而来，一齐动手，你三件，她四件，不到十分钟就分完了。主任强留下一件，说：“这件你们谁也别拿。前天我到王素清大娘家去，她说别看她年纪大，也要为钢而战，有什么活让给她送点去，这件衣服就留给她做吧，别辜负了她老人家的心意。”
    王素清老大娘拿到布和棉花的时候，可高兴了。她精心细致地作这件棉衣，棉花铺的匀，针线缝的密。做完了，老大娘看着自己亲手给炼钢小伙子做的棉衣，低声嘀咕道：“这回我也算为钢出点力了。”
    为了让炼钢工人早日穿上棉衣，家属们都是起早贪黑地做，不到三天的工夫，就作好了一百多件，提前交了工。
    10月25日的早晨，她们顶着小北风把做好的棉衣送到了独身职工宿舍。职工们穿上暖和可身的棉衣时，感激地说：“我们一定要以厂为家，保证用完成今年的钢产任务，来回答党的关怀和家属们的支援。”
