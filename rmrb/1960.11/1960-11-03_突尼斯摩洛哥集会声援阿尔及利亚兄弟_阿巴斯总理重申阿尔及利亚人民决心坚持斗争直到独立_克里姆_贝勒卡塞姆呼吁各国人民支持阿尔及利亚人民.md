    这次集会是由突尼斯执政党新宪政党组织的。参加这次集会的有各阶层人民，其中包括工人、青年、学生、妇女和农民。出席这次集会的还有突尼斯和阿尔及利亚两国政府的部长和军官以及各国驻突尼斯的外交使节。正在这里访问的中国驻摩洛哥大使白认，参加突尼斯国际博览会的中国展览团正副团长也出席了这次集会。

    阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯在欢呼声中在集会上讲了话。他说：“阿尔及利亚人民将继续进行斗争，直到获得独立为止。”
    他说，“阿尔及利亚人民为独立而战。阿尔及利亚人民所进行的战争首先是一个争取独立的战争和反对殖民主义的战争，阿尔及利亚的战争不仅是阿尔及利亚人民的战争，而且是整个非洲人民的战争，特别是北非人民的战争。”
    阿巴斯总理在讲话中谴责了北大西洋集团在政治、经济、军事上支持法国帝国主义在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争。
    他还说，“突尼斯人民的团结和支持是对阿尔及利亚人民的一种鼓舞”。他要求突尼斯人民保持和加强对战斗的阿尔及利亚人民的援助。

    迈赫里说，阿尔及利亚人民是爱好和平的人民，但是殖民主义却把战争强加在他们头上。他强调说，阿尔及利亚人民立誓把他们的战斗进行到底，直到获得独立为止。
    突尼斯新宪政党总书记帕伊·拉德哈姆在会上讲了话，他说，突尼斯人民和阿尔及利亚人民在历史上遭受过同样的苦难。因此，“两国牢固地团结一致是很自然的，同时我们有着共同的斗争和事业”。他说，这场战争不仅是阿尔及利亚人民的战争，突尼斯将用一切办法坚决支持阿尔及利亚人民。他说，未来是属于阿尔及利亚的。
    在大会进行中，人们高呼“打倒帝国主义！”“打倒法国殖民主义的将军们！”等口号。
