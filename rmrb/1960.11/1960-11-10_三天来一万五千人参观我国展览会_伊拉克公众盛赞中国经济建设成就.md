Every day before the exhibition hall opens, many people wait at the entrance well in advance. Iraqi visitors say that this is the first time they have had the opportunity to see a Chinese industrial and agricultural exhibition, so they must take a good look. They have shown great interest in the exhibits. Various industrial machines, agricultural machinery, people's commune models, and handicrafts are always surrounded by many people. Many visitors like to reach out and touch the shiny "Red Flag" sedan car made in China when they pass by it. Drivers ask if all the parts are made in China, and when they receive an affirmative answer, they express great surprise and joy. They say, "China is amazing!"

Iraqi farmers watched Chinese agricultural machinery in the square with great interest. Whenever the "Dongfanghong" tractor finished its performance, newly arrived visitors always asked for another performance. After seeing the operation demonstration of Chinese improved farm tools, some people repeatedly smiled and said, "Walking on two legs is good!"

A young man named Tawfiq said, "What I saw in the exhibition reminded me of the meaning of the Great Leap Forward and made me clearly see what a country can do in a short period of time after getting rid of imperialism and exploitation." Another visitor said, "The Chinese exhibition shows that the great Chinese people are striding forward and racing against time." One visitor said: "We often hear about China and its great achievements in a short period of time, and we are surprised, but when I saw this exhibition in Baghdad with my own eyes, I was even more surprised, because China's achievements exceeded my imagination." Another visitor said, "The Chinese people are creators of miracles. I think this exhibition is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life." Another visitor said, "The Chinese exhibition is a symbol of peace and freedom."

Many visitors expressed their hope to further enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people after seeing the exhibition.

  “我们经常听到关于中国和它在短时期内取得的重大成就，我们感到很惊奇，但是当我在巴格达亲眼看到这个展览会时，我感到更惊奇，因为中国的成就超过我所想像的”。另一位参观者说：“中国人民是奇迹的创造者。我认为这个展览会是我一生中看到过的最美丽的东西。”还有一位参观者说：“中国展览会是和平和自由的象征。”
