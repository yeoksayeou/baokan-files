    After Cadres Go Down to the Front Lines
    Being a Good Advisor
    I actively responded to the Party's call to "vigorously develop agriculture, vigorously develop grain production, and strengthen the front lines of agricultural production." Two months ago, I was transferred from the provincial Party committee to the Yanghe Commune in Jiaoxian County, where I became the deputy leader of the first production team of the Nantancheng production brigade.
    After arriving at the production team, I quickly became familiar with the team leader, Xue Liandong. Comrade Xue Liandong works hard all day long, but in his busy schedule, he has not neglected to study the policies. I joined him in using our evening time to study the Party's guidelines and policies and the experience of other regions in leading production. We studied the "Three Guarantees and One Reward" and "Four Fixes" policies, as well as the experience of three teams in Zhaoyang County, Hubei Province, in leading production. Based on their experience, we first established a team committee composed of five people, led by Comrade Xue Liandong, to implement collective leadership and divide responsibilities. Because the organization was improved and the collective's role was brought into play, in the busy "Three Autumns" work, the work team leader was responsible for dividing the team's labor force into three fronts: accumulating and transporting fertilizer, rushing to plant winter wheat, and autumn harvesting. Each front had a team cadre responsible for leadership, so the work was carried out in an orderly manner. Subsequently, the team committee and the members discussed and formulated reasonable production management systems. First, the system of recording points by time was changed to evaluating work and recording points, and a "Four Fixes" responsibility system was implemented, which defined tasks, quality, time, and rewards and punishments. Due to the improvement of leadership methods and the sound management system, the enthusiasm of the members was increased, and the cadres' leadership of production became more proactive. For example, in the past, when work points were recorded by time, some members were unwilling to do heavy work. After changing to evaluating work and recording points, everyone was willing to do both light and heavy work. In the past, team leader Xue Liandong only cared about arranging farm work and did not pay attention to checking production. Now he can take the time to go to the work team to check the production progress and work quality.

### 当好参谋

    干部下放第一线以后
    当好参谋
    我积极响应党的“大办农业、大办粮食，加强农业生产第一线”的号召，两个月以前，由省委机关下放到胶县洋河公社，担任了南谈城生产队第一生产小队的副队长。
    到了生产小队以后，很快就和小队长薛连东搞熟了。薛连东同志整天忙里忙外，辛辛苦苦地工作，但是他在百忙中并没有忽视对政策的学习。我和他一起抽晚上的时间学习党的方针政策和其他地区领导生产的经验。我们学习了“三包一奖”、“四固定”政策和湖北枣阳县三个小队领导生产的经验。根据他们的经验，首先建立起以薛连东同志为主由五人组成的队委会，实行集体领导，分工负责。由于健全了组织，发挥了集体的作用，在繁忙的“三秋”工作中，由作业组长负责把全队的劳力分成积肥运肥、抢种冬麦和秋收三条战线，每个战线都有小队的干部负责领导，这样干起活来就有条不紊了。接着由队委会和社员讨论并制订了合理的生产管理制度，首先把按时记分改为评工记分，并实行了定任务、定质量、定时间、定奖惩的“四定”责任制。由于改进了领导方法和健全了管理制度，社员的劳动积极性提高了，干部领导生产也更主动了。如以前按时记工分，有的社员就不愿意做重活，改为评工记分以后，不论轻活重活大家都愿意干；以前，小队长薛连东只顾安排农活，顾不到检查生产，现在他能够抽出时间到作业组检查生产进度和工作质量。
