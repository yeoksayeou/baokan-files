Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 4th: Félix-Roland Moumié, President of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (UPC), died in a hospital in Geneva on the evening of the 3rd.

Moumié was taken to the hospital on October 16, three days after his arrival in Switzerland. According to Geneva newspapers, someone poisoned his food at a reception held in Geneva for him.

Moumié was one of the founders of the Union of the Peoples of Cameroon (established in 1948), the largest political organization in Cameroon. The Union has been fighting for the genuine independence of the Cameroonian nation, the elimination of colonialism, and the unification of Cameroon. To achieve the above goals, the Union led the Cameroonian people in launching an armed struggle from the summer of 1956 against French colonialists supported by U.S. imperialism.

Moumié was thirty-four years old. He condemned the U.S. imperialist plot to make Cameroon a U.S. military base, and U.S. support for French colonialists in massacring patriotic Cameroonians. He also condemned the United Nations for becoming a tool for the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

Moumié paid a friendly visit to China last October.

    喀麦隆人民联盟主席
    穆米埃逝世
    新华社4日讯日内瓦消息：喀麦隆人民联盟主席费利克斯·罗兰·穆米埃3日晚上在日内瓦的一所医院里逝世。
    穆米埃是在10月16日即他到达瑞士的三天以后被送到医院里去的。据日内瓦报纸报道，在日内瓦人们为他举行的一次招待会上，有人在他的食物中下了毒药。
    穆米埃是喀麦隆最大的政治组织喀麦隆人民联盟的创建人之一（1948年建立）。这个联盟一直为争取喀麦隆民族的真正独立、消灭殖民主义和统一喀麦隆而斗争。为了上述目的，这个联盟领导喀麦隆人民从1956年夏季开始展开了武装斗争，反对得到美帝国主义支持的法国殖民主义者。
    穆米埃今年三十四岁。他曾谴责美帝国主义企图使喀麦隆成为美国军事基地的阴谋以及美国支持法国殖民者屠杀喀麦隆爱国人民。他还谴责联合国成为美国干涉其他国家内政的工具。
    穆米埃去年10月曾来中国进行友好访问。
