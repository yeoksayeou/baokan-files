Improving the Leadership Level of Production Teams is an Important Link in Consolidating People's Communes
—Reading the "Investigation Report on the Sixth Team of the Huangyang Production Brigade, Erba Commune, Wuwei County, Gansu Province"
Gansu Daily Editorial Department

On November 10th, the seventh edition of the People's Daily published the "Investigation Report on Improving the Leadership Methods of Production Teams—The Sixth Team of the Huangyang Production Brigade, Erba Commune, Wuwei County, Gansu Province," co-authored by comrades Sun Min, Zhang Yongshou, and Wang Zongqi. This investigation report vividly reflects all aspects of this team's activities. Their activities, methods, and systems are all reasonable and in line with the Party's policies. Their system of collective leadership with individual responsibility, lively and active democratic life, the system of each contributing their best, distribution according to labor, and more pay for more work, the appropriate, thoughtful, and frugal living arrangements, and the tense, joyful, and close-knit daily life are so cordial and pleasant, reflecting the new face of the rural people's commune. This investigation report is worthy of reference and study by relevant comrades.

Implementing the policy of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation, vigorously developing agriculture, and vigorously developing grain production is a glorious undertaking shared by hundreds of millions of people, but the main responsibility still rests with the rural people's communes. The production team is the most basic level of the people's commune and is the most direct and specific organizer and leader of the production and life of the commune members. All the Party's guidelines and policies must meet with the masses through the team to be implemented; all tasks must also be carried out through the team to mobilize and organize the masses to complete them. Therefore, improving the leadership level of team cadres and running the team well is currently the most important link in consolidating the people's commune and vigorously developing agriculture and grain production. This investigation report introduces the team's working methods in detail and systematically, and after reading it, I feel that there are several points worth chewing over repeatedly and widely promoting.

The first is to grasp policies and ideology. It is necessary to implement the Party's policies to the end, hand them over to the masses, and get the masses' thinking straightened out, so that the masses become conscious fighters for implementing the Party's guidelines and policies.

To make everyone consciously give play to their enthusiasm for production, two things must be grasped: First, the Party's various policies must be repeatedly studied and discussed by the masses until they are thoroughly understood; only when they are thorough and understood can they grasp the essence, use them flexibly, and be creative. What is the essence? It is what the six-team cadres said: "The Party's policies are all for increasing production, improving people's lives, and producing more grain." That's right! The fundamental purpose of our revolution is to develop production and make the people live a happy life. No matter when, where, or what work we do, we must firmly remember this, which is the standard for measuring whether all work is done well or badly.

To implement policies, one must keep one's word. The six-team cadres said: "In doing things, one must take one step at a time. As a cadre, one must say one is one, and two is two. Otherwise, if one speaks empty words, the commune members will not believe it, how can one implement policies and lead production well." Cadres must gain the trust of the masses in handling affairs. It is precisely because they resolutely and thoroughly implement the Party's policies without the slightest perfunctory attitude, and promptly distribute the overproduction bonus to everyone, and handle fertilizer issues according to quantity, quality, and graded pricing, that the commune members' enthusiasm has become greater and greater, the fertilizer has become more and more abundant and better, and production has improved day by day.

Second, it is necessary to do a good job in political and ideological work. This is the key to doing all work well. Of course, doing ideological work is not just about generally explaining principles and issuing calls; the most important and valuable thing is to grasp the word "alive," which is what the six-team cadres said: "Not only must we see what the commune members are doing, but we must also know what they are thinking in their hearts." They used the method of connecting with pieces of land to understand the ideological situation of the commune members at various times, often analyzed and studied it, grasped the main ideological problems, and then prescribed the right medicine to the disease.

How to do ideological work is also a great knowledge. They used the method of relying on the masses to educate themselves, grasping specific problems, raising them to principles, and solving them from the real to the abstract and from the abstract to the real, which is a good method worthy of promotion. Everyone else casually used tree branches to beat livestock, but Wang Yiwen found some rotten hemp and broken leather strips and twisted a whip for the cattle, which was both labor-saving and did not harm the livestock when shouting at them. This is almost a trivial matter, but they seized on such a trivial matter and repeatedly organized commune members to discuss it, and educated the commune members on running the commune diligently and thriftily, loving the commune like their home, and being the masters of their own affairs. This way of doing things is lively in form, profound in impression, and has achieved good results. Everyone learned from Wang Yiwen and actively used the "ten sides" of open space to plant hemp, cut cattails, and reeds, twist ropes, and weave baskets, saving the team's financial expenditure. They have made ideological work alive.

The second is to organize the leadership team. No matter what you do, if you want to do it well, you must first have a sound leadership team, which is what the masses often say is to have a good helmsman and guide. If the rudder is held steady and the road is led correctly, you can avoid reefs and grounding, and avoid or take fewer detours. How to organize this team? This team's experience is: it is necessary to carefully select good guides from the commune members. This team has its own representatives of men, women, old and young, that is, the four "staff officers," five "vanguards," and three "logisticians" introduced in the article, all of whom are activists in the team. Representatives selected from them formed the team committee, and the members of the team committee and activists accounted for one-third of the team's labor force. They united around the Party and firmly implemented the Party's policies, thus fully playing the role of the Party's fighting fortress in the countryside. These activists are politically pure and advanced elements who have been tested in previous movements. They are pragmatists, each of whom is connected to a part of the masses. They all love the collective cause and are loyal to public affairs, contributing their best. Not only do they strive to do their responsible work well, but they also love to take care of socialist "idle affairs." They are all new-type figures with noble styles, the locomotives of the team. With so many backbone forces, when encountering things, one leads two, which mobilizes the enthusiasm of all the commune members, and everything is easy to handle. In fact, in all walks of life and in all places, the masses have their own leading figures, their own Zhuge Liang, and extraordinary figures such as Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, Ma Chao, and Huang Zhong. The key lies in whether the comrades who are doing leadership work are discovering, cultivating, and using them. As long as you visit the thatched cottage three times, you will definitely invite Zhuge Liang.

The third is democratic management. The six-team cadres said: "If you want it to be good, everyone should do it." This is a very important move to do all work well. The team is everyone's team, and the team's affairs are everyone's affairs. Therefore, everyone must handle everyone's affairs, collective management, and individual responsibility. What we call democratic management is to promote the democratic style of consulting with the masses when encountering problems, and to rely on the strength of the collective. Some people, despite often shouting the mass line, forget this when they encounter specific work, thinking that they can do it themselves and believing that coercion and command can cut the Gordian knot quickly. Wrong. Strictly speaking, whether to take the mass line or not is not only a matter of working methods, but also a matter of position and world view. We are historical materialists and believe that labor creates the world and the masses create history, so all work must follow the mass line. Explain the situation clearly to the masses, explain the problems, explain the policies, and mobilize the masses to think of ways and find measures, and any problem will be solved easily. Comrade Mao Zedong told us: "As long as we rely on the people and firmly believe that the creativity of the people is infinite, and therefore trust the people and become one with the people, then any difficulty can be overcome, and any enemy cannot overwhelm us, but will only be overwhelmed by us." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume III, p. 1097)

The six-team's mass line is well implemented because they not only solved ideological problems, but also established a complete system of democratic life, often holding various meetings such as team committees, activist meetings, commune member meetings, and group meetings, cultivating the commune members' sense of ownership, and ensuring that everyone has ample opportunity to speak. They also have a particularly active "democratic kang," where leaders and the led, cadres and the masses are as close as a family, and can speak freely and talk heart to heart. With such a full democratic life and a lively and active political atmosphere, the result will inevitably be "a hundred people with a hundred plans, a hundred battles with a hundred victories." Every comrade who is doing leadership work should think carefully about whether they and the comrades they lead are as close as they are, whether they have mobilized everyone's enthusiasm, and should also study whether they can establish a "democratic kang" and a sound system of democratic life suitable for their own unit and department.

The fourth is to use troops skillfully. The way to be a general lies in using troops skillfully. This requires knowing the soldiers and loving the soldiers. That is, as the investigation report says, it is necessary to organize rationally according to people, take care of characteristics, give play to expertise, combine work and rest, and protect the enthusiasm of the masses. These fully embody the spirit of understanding people, trusting people, and caring for people, and are good ways to ensure that everyone makes the best use of their talents. Doing these things can mobilize the enthusiasm of all people and achieve a tenfold effect with one, and be invincible everywhere. The six-team's labor over-quota movement and years of good harvests are the result of skillful use of troops. The words still have to be said, if you want to use troops skillfully, you must first solve the ideological and methodological problems of the cadres. There must be the masses in the eyes, and it must be truly admitted that "everyone is a saint" and "thousands of pounds of burdens are carried by everyone." At the same time, the work style must be solid, like the team leader Zhang Dongyuan, who knows the situation of the people he leads (experience, technology, temper, etc.) "clearly," so that he can talk about knowing people's strengths and weaknesses, letting go of his hands to use them, and taking care of them meticulously. Lacking these two points, or any one of them, to use troops skillfully is just empty talk.

The fifth is to understand the laws. Everything has its own laws of development, depending on whether we can recognize and master them. Mastering the laws means winning the initiative and being able to stand high and see far, just like the investigation report says, knowing a year in advance, seeing a few steps ahead, grasping the present with one hand and preparing with the other, and starting early to prepare well, not fighting unprepared battles. Military strategists often say, "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will win every battle." To farm, you must know the weather, climate, soil, seeds, and the situation of your own troops and supplies. The former is the enemy, the latter is yourself. By clarifying the bottom line of both sides and taking effective measures, you will take the initiative and achieve twice the result with half the effort and be invincible. For example, after clarifying the laws of crop lodging and fertilization, Wang Zhuguo and Wen Jizhao, who accumulated fertilizer, were able to directly press the manure into the ground without entering the village, saving labor for transporting soil and fertilizer back and forth. Because everyone worked together to understand the laws of agricultural production, this year's crops are still growing in the ground, and they know what to plant and do on that piece of land next year. What is the bottom line? The bottom line is the basic situation, the law, and the scientific foresight. Although the laws of various places and things have their own particularities, to do a good job and engage in good production, we should all learn the ability to understand the bottom line and make all preparations based on this bottom line.

The sixth is to do a good job in small-scale contracting and quota management. This is an important issue related to the socialist principle of each contributing their best and distribution according to labor, and it is an important measure to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. If rewards and punishments are not clear and distribution is not reasonable, it is difficult to mobilize people's enthusiasm. At this stage, we are still contributing our best and distributing according to labor, which is a combination of the wage system and the supply system. Therefore, rural people's communes must grasp the "three guarantees and one reward," quota management, and pay attention to adhering to the small-scale ownership of the team. Like the six-team, it is necessary to implement the four fixings of labor, land, draft animals, and farm tools. Once these are fixed, people's hearts are fixed, which can enhance the commune members' sense of responsibility and make everyone wholeheartedly and boldly let go to do it. With this, there will be all kinds of methods and creativity. These are all basic policies in current agricultural production. To grasp them well and thoroughly, we must first grasp them carefully and flexibly. Large-scale corps operations cannot be separated from the activities of squads and platoons, and the commune cannot ignore the work of teams and groups. Therefore, we must be determined to grasp the team and the group in a down-to-earth manner, and earnestly implement small-scale contracting and labor quotas. In the process of promoting contracting and quota management, some people are afraid of complexity and difficulty, and often either do not do it or copy it at all levels, resulting in contracting quotas that are unrealistic and unreasonable. There are hundreds of large and small jobs in agriculture, which are complex enough. However, don't be afraid. No matter how complex things are, as long as the leadership pays attention and mobilizes the masses, there is nothing that cannot be done well. The six-team implemented the method of leadership research, implementing item by item, personal experimentation, and mass modification, so that all kinds of quotas were made practical and reasonable. They can do it well, of course other teams can also do it well.

The seventh is to grasp life. This is a very important task at any time. To mobilize the enthusiasm of the commune members and keep them in a full mood, we must grasp both ideology and life. The instructor's speech, plus the administrator's meal, can do things well. The two complement each other and are indispensable.

To grasp life, we must first solve the problem of eating well. "Food is the most important thing for the people," and no one can do without eating every day. Before communization, during the advanced cooperatives, only production was collectivized, and life was still individual. At that time, the quality of the family "canteen" only affected the lives of three or five people. After communization, life was also collectivized, and the quality of the canteen would affect the lives of one or two hundred people. Therefore, running the canteen well is the central link in managing the lives of the commune members. How can we run the canteen well? The six-team also provided experience. They first paid attention to selecting managers, cooks, and grain processors, and sent the team's outstanding Communist Party members and thrifty housekeepers with good quality, good style, good composition, and fair handling of affairs to run the canteen. This laid the foundation for running the canteen well. They implemented the method of collective management of grain by the production team, and formulated the system of "predetermining the next meal for the previous meal, the canteen cooking according to the quantity, and the commune members saving for themselves," vividly implementing the policy of "quantifying according to people, assigning quotas to households, grain to the hall, eating by ticket, and saving for oneself," vigorously engaging in family-based production, achieving no leftover food in the canteen and surplus grain for the commune members, ensuring that everyone eats well and saves.

The problem of life is a complex problem. According to the spirit of large collective and small freedom, in addition to ensuring common basic needs, we should also take care of the special needs of some people. Just like the women mentioned in the article visiting relatives, the elderly riding livestock, young people playing basketball, and even the income, clothing, and walking problems of the blind Grandma Wang Er, etc., all need to be managed. If these problems are well managed, their worries will be solved, and everyone will be more energetic in production. They are able to do so well because the cadres honestly listen to the Party's words, clarify the purpose of our Party in doing everything, and unite production and life, and being responsible to the superiors and being responsible to the masses.

The eighth, and also the most important, of their experiences is specific situations, specific analysis. This spirit runs through all aspects of this team's work: when planting winter wheat, they found that it is best to have three small leaves before it freezes, neither too early nor too late; when deploying troops, they adapt to people, give play to expertise, and even blind people, the elderly, and children have jobs that they can do well and have income, and have savings in the credit cooperative... Specific problems, specific analysis, this is living Marxism-Leninism; mechanically copying will turn the true scripture into dogma. Delicious Jiangnan oranges transplanted to the north of the Huai River become unpalatable trifoliate oranges, mainly because they are not suitable for the climate and soil of northern Jiangsu. The responsibility of the leading organs is to grasp policies and understand the situation; and one of the important purposes of understanding the situation is to seriously and flexibly and vividly implement policies. Therefore, our cadres must promote investigation and research and specific analysis of specific situations in order to implement policies and do their work well.

    提高生产小队领导水平，是巩固人民公社的重要环节
    ——读《甘肃省武威县二坝公社黄羊生产队第六小队调查报告》
    甘肃日报编辑部
    11月10日，人民日报第七版刊载了孙民、张永寿、王宗祺同志合写的《改进生产小队的领导方法——甘肃省武威县二坝公社黄羊生产队第六小队调查报告》。这份调查报告生动地反映了这个小队活动的各个方面。他们的活动、作法和制度，都合情合理，合乎党的政策。他们的集体领导分工负责制度，生动活泼的民主生活，各尽所能、按劳分配、多劳多得的制度和小段包工办法，妥贴、周到、勤俭节约的生活安排，紧张、欢乐、亲如一家的日常生活，是那么亲切宜人，反映了农村人民公社的新面貌。这份调查报告值得有关同志参考学习。
    贯彻发展国民经济以农业为基础的方针，大办农业，大办粮食，这是亿万人民共同的光荣的事业，但主要的责任仍要由农村人民公社来承担。生产小队是人民公社的最基层，是社员生产和生活的最直接最具体的组织者和领导者。党的一切方针、政策都要经过小队和群众见面，贯彻执行；各项任务也都要通过小队来发动和组织群众去完成。因此，提高小队干部的领导水平，办好小队，是当前巩固人民公社，大办农业、大办粮食的最重要的环节。这个调查报告详尽地、系统地介绍了小队的工作方法，读后觉得有几点值得反复咀嚼，广为推行。
    头一条，就是要抓政策、抓思想。要把党的政策贯彻到底，交给群众，把群众的思想搞通，使群众变成执行党的方针、政策的自觉的战士。
    要使人人自觉地发挥生产积极性，必须抓两条：第一，是党的各项政策一定要让群众反复学习讨论，说透想通；只有透了、通了，才能抓住实质，灵活运用，而且有创造性。实质是什么？就是六小队干部说的：“党的政策都是为了增加生产，改善人民生活，多打粮食。”说得对！我们革命的根本目的，就是为了发展生产，为了使人民过幸福的生活。不管在什么时候、什么地方、作什么工作，都要牢牢记住这一条，这是衡量一切工作作好作坏的标准。
    贯彻执行政策，一定要说话兑现。六小队的干部说：“为人做事，都要一步一个脚印，当干部，说话更得说一是一，说二是二。要不，说了空话，社员们不相信，怎能够贯彻政策，领导好生产。”干部办事情一定要取信于群众。正是由于他们坚决彻底地贯彻执行党的政策，丝毫不苟，把超产奖励部分及时地分给了大家，按量按质和分等论价地处理了肥料问题，社员的干劲就越来越大，肥料就越来越多越好，生产天天向上了。
    第二，是要做好政治思想工作。这是做好一切工作的关键。当然，做思想工作，不只是一般地讲道理，发号召，最重要、最宝贵的是要抓一个“活”字，也就是六小队干部说的：“不但要看见社员们在做什么，而且要知道他们心里在想什么。”他们用分片联系的方法，了解社员们在各个时期的思想情况，经常分析研究，抓住主要的思想问题，然后有的放矢，对症下药。
    怎样作思想工作，这也大有学问。他们用的是依靠群众自己教育自己，抓住具体问题，提高到原则上，由实到虚，以虚带实地加以解决的方法，是值得推广的好办法。别人都随便用树枝子打牲口，王义文却找了些烂麻破皮条，拧了一根牛鞭子，用它吆喝牲口既省劲又不伤牲口。这几乎是微不足道的小事，但他们正是抓住这样的小事，反复地组织社员讨论，对社员进行勤俭办社、爱社如家、当家作主的教育。这样作，形式活泼，印象深刻，收到了良好的效果。大家都向王义文学习，纷纷利用“十边”空地种麻、割马莲、芨芨，搓绳，编筐，节约了队里的财务开支。他们把思想工作作活了。
    第二条，是组织领导班子。不管办什么事，想办好，首先必须有一个健全的领导班子，也就是群众常说的要有好的掌舵的和带路的。舵掌得稳，路领得正，就可以不触礁搁浅，不走或少走弯路。怎样组织这个班子呢？这个小队的经验是：要认真地从社员群众中选拔好的带路人。这个小队的男女老少都有自己的代表人物，就是文中介绍的四“参谋”、五“先锋”、三“后勤”，他们都是队里的积极分子。从他们当中推选代表组成了队委会，队委会的委员和积极分子就占了全队劳动力的三分之一，他们团结在党的周围，坚定地执行党的政策，从而充分地发挥了党在农村的战斗堡垒作用。这些积极分子，政治纯洁，是经过历次运动考验的先进分子，是实干家，每个人都联系着一部分群众，他们都热爱集体事业，对公众的事情忠心耿耿，各尽所能，不但争先恐后作好自己负责的工作，还爱管社会主义的“闲事”。他们都是一些风格高尚的新型人物，小队的火车头。有了这样多的骨干力量，遇到事情，一个带两个，就调动了全体社员的积极性，一切事情就好办了。其实，各行各业、各个地方，群众都有自己的领袖人物，都有自己的诸葛亮，都有关、张、赵、马、黄等非凡的人物。关键在于作领导工作的同志，是不是去发现、培养和使用他们。只要
  “三顾茅庐”，是一定会请出“诸葛亮”来的。
    第三条，是民主管理。六小队的干部说：“若要好，大家搞。”这是作好一切工作的很重要的一着。小队是大家的小队，小队的事是大家的事。因此，大家的事必须大家办，集体管理，分工负责。我们所说的民主管理，就是遇事要发扬同群众商量的民主作风，要依靠集体的力量。有些人尽管常喊群众路线，但是一碰到具体工作，就忘了这一条，认为自己能行，不和群众商量，迷信强迫命令能够快刀斩乱麻。错了。严格地说，要不要群众路线和走不走群众路线，不仅是工作方法问题，而且是立场问题和世界观问题。我们是历史唯物主义者，认为劳动创造世界，群众创造历史，因而作一切工作都要走群众路线。给群众讲清形势，讲明问题，交代政策，发动群众想办法，找措施，任何问题都会迎刃而解。毛泽东同志告诉我们：
  “只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”（《毛泽东选集》第三卷1097页）
    六小队的群众路线贯彻得好，是因为他们不但解决了思想问题，而且建立了一套完整的民主生活的制度，经常召开队委会、积极分子会、社员会、小组会等各种会议，培养社员的主人翁态度，保证人人都有充分的发言机会。他们还有一个特别活跃的“民主炕”，在这里，领导和被领导、干部和群众亲如一家人，都可以畅所欲言，倾心而谈。有了这样充分的民主生活，生动活泼的政治空气，就必然会带来“百人百计，百战百胜”的结果。每一个作领导工作的同志，都应该好好地想一想，自己和被领导的同志，是否也和他们一样亲密无间？是否调动了大家的积极性；而且要研究一下，是否可以在本单位、本部门建立起适合自己特点的“民主炕”和一套健全的民主生活制度。
    第四条，是巧用兵。为将之道，在于巧用兵。这就必须知兵、爱兵。也就是调查报告中说的，要因人制宜，合理组织，照顾特点，发挥专长，劳逸结合，爱护群众的积极性。这些充分体现了了解人、信任人、体贴人的精神，是保证人尽其才的好办法。作到这些，就能调动一切人的积极性，就能以十当百，所向皆捷。六小队的劳动超定额运动和连年丰收，就是巧用兵的结果。话还得说回来，要想巧用兵，先要解决干部的思想问题和方法问题。眼睛里要有群众，真正承认“众人是圣人”，“千斤担子众人担”。同时，作风要扎实，像小队长张东元那样，对自己所领导的人的情况（经历、技术、脾气等）都一清二楚”，才能谈到知人长短，放手使用，体贴入微。缺乏这两点，或者其中的任何一点，要想巧用兵，便是一句空话。
    第五条，是摸规律。一切事物都有自己的发展规律，就看我们能否认识和掌握它。掌握了规律，就争得了主动，能够站得高，看得远，就像调查报告中说的一年早知道，早看几步棋，一手抓当前，一手抓准备，及早动手作好准备，不打无准备之仗。兵家常说，“知己知彼，百战百胜”。务庄稼，就要知道天时、气候、土壤、种子和自己的兵马粮草的情况。前者是彼，后者是己，摸清了双方的底，采取有效措施，自己就主动了，就可以事半功倍，立于不败之地。例如，摸清了作物倒槎和施肥的规律，积肥的王柱国和文吉兆便作到了粪不进村就直接压到了地里，节省了往返运土运肥的劳动力。由于大家一齐动手摸农业生产的规律，今年的庄稼还在地里长着，他们对明年那块地种啥、干啥都有了底。什么是底？底就是基本情况，就是规律，就是科学的预见。尽管各个地方，各种事物的规律有自己的特殊性，但是，要做好工作、搞好生产，都应该学会摸底的本领，并本着这个底做好一切准备工作。
    第六条，是搞好小包工和定额管理。这是关乎到社会主义各尽所能、按劳分配原则的重要问题，是调动群众积极性的重要措施。赏罚不严明，分配不合理，要想调动人的积极性，是很困难的。现阶段我们还是各尽所能，按劳分配，是工资制和供给制结合，因而农村人民公社一定要抓好“三包一奖”，定额管理，注意坚持小队的小部分所有制。要像六小队那样，实行劳力、土地、耕畜、农具四固定。这些固定了，人的心就定了，就可以增强社员的责任心，使大家一心一意地放手大胆地去干。有了这一条，才会有千方百计，才会有创造性。这些都是当前农业生产中的基本政策。要抓好、抓透，首先得抓细、抓活。大兵团作战，离不了班、排活动，公社更不能忽视小队、小组的工作。因此，必须下决心扎扎实实地抓小队，抓小组，切实地实行小包工和劳动定额。在推行包工和定额管理当中，有的人怕复杂，不好搞，往往不是不搞，就是层层照搬，致使包工定额不切实际，不合理。农业上的活路大大小小不下百十种，是够复杂的。但是，不要怕，事情再复杂，只要领导重视，发动群众，没有办不好的。六小队实行了领导研究，逐件落实，亲身试验，群众修改的办法，就把各种定额都搞得切实合理。他们能搞好，当然别的队也可以搞好。
    第七条，是抓生活。这在任何时候，都是一件很重要的工作。要调动社员的积极性，使社员经常保持饱满的情绪，就必须思想、生活一齐抓。指导员讲话，加上事务长开饭，才能办好事情。两者相辅相成，缺一不可。
    抓生活，首先要很好地解决吃饭问题。“民以食为天”，任何人每天不吃饭都是不行的。公社化以前高级社时，只是生产集体化了，而生活还是个体的。那时，家庭“食堂”办的好坏，只影响三、五人的生活。而公社化以后，生活也集体化了，食堂办的好坏，就会影响一、二百人的生活。因此，办好食堂是管好社员生活的中心环节。怎样才能办好食堂？六小队也提供了经验。他们首先注意选择管理员、炊事员、粮食加工员，把队里优秀的共产党员和品质好、作风好、成分好、办事公平的勤俭持家能手，派去办食堂。这就打下了办好食堂的底子。他们实行粮食交生产队集体保管的办法，制定了“上顿预 定下顿饭 ，食堂按量做饭，社员节约归己”的制度，生动地贯彻执行了“以人定量，指标到户，粮食到堂，凭票吃饭，节约归己”的政策，大搞家底生产，作到了食堂无剩饭，社员有余粮，保证大家吃好又节省。
    生活问题，是一个复杂的问题，要按照大集体小自由的精神，除了保证共同的基本的需要之外，还应照顾一些人的特殊需要。就像文中提到的妇女走亲戚、串娘家，老年人出门骑牲口，青年人打篮球，甚至盲人王二奶奶的收入、穿衣和走路问题，等等，都需要管。这些问题管得好，就解决了他们的后顾之忧，大家对生产就越发起劲。他们所以能够搞得这样好，是因为干部老老实实地听党的话，明确了我们党办一切事情的目的，把生产和生活，把对上级负责和对群众负责统一了起来。
    第八条，也是他们经验中最重要的一条，就是具体情况，具体分析。这种精神贯穿在这个小队工作的各个方面：种冬麦，他们找出了不迟不早，冰冻前出三个小叶的时候最好；调兵遣将，他们是因人制宜，发挥专长，就连瞎子、老人、娃娃也都有力能胜任的活干，有收入，在信用部里有存款……。具体问题，具体分析，这是活的马克思列宁主义；生搬硬套，就会把真经变成教条。美味的江南桔子移植到淮河以北，就变成了难吃的枳子，主要是因为它不适于淮北的气候土壤。领导机关的责任，是掌握政策、了解情况；而了解情况的重要目的之一，又是为了严肃而又灵活生动地贯彻执行政策。因此，我们的干部要贯彻政策，作好工作，就要提倡调查研究，提倡具体情况具体分析。
