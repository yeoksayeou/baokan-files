Xinhua News Agency, 11th: Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Herter yesterday held talks with Jeong Il-hyung, the "Foreign Minister" of the South Korean puppet regime, who was summoned to the United States. In the joint statement of the talks, Herter boosted the puppet regime and clamored that they would "make every effort to 'unify' Korea in accordance with the illegal resolutions of the United Nations."

In the joint statement, Herter greatly praised the South Korean puppet regime's reactionary measures to strengthen the suppression of domestic democratic movements, so-called "realizing domestic political stability," and said he was "encouraged" by this.

The joint statement also clamored that this U.S. puppet "is fully qualified to become a member state of the United Nations."

According to United Press International, Jeong Il-hyung has "received private assurances" that after Kennedy takes office, the U.S. government will continue to place military and economic "aid" to support the South Korean puppet regime in "the highest priority." U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Parsons also specifically "discussed this prospect" with Jeong Il-hyung on the afternoon of the 9th.

The news agency said that Kennedy's guaranteed immediate action to "increase defense spending and modernize the U.S. Army" will also "indirectly benefit" the puppet regime because it "provides the opportunity to give the existing U.S. (troops in South Korea's) weapons and vehicles to" the puppet army.

    美国为南朝鲜傀儡政权打气
    郑一亨奉召去美国同赫脱会谈
    双方叫嚷要阻挠朝鲜和平统一
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱昨天同奉召到美国的朝鲜南方傀儡政权的“外务部长官”郑一亨举行了会谈。在会谈联合声明中，赫脱对这个傀儡政权打气，并且叫嚣他们要“尽一切努力根据联合国的非法决议”来“统一”朝鲜。
    赫脱在联合声明中对朝鲜南方傀儡政权加强镇压国内民主运动的所谓“实现国内政治稳定”的反动措施倍加赞扬，并说对此“感到鼓舞”。
    这项联合声明还叫嚷，美国的这个傀儡“完全有资格成为联合国的会员国”。
    据合众国际社报道，郑一亨已经“得到私下保证”：肯尼迪上台以后，美国政府还要继续把支撑朝鲜南部傀儡政权的军事和经济的“援助”放在“最优先的地位”。美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿帕森斯在9日下午还专门同郑一亨“讨论了这一前景”。
    这家通讯社说，肯尼迪所保证的立即“增加国防开支和使美国陆军现代化”的行动还将使这个傀儡政权“间接得到好处”，因为它“提供了把现有的美国（在朝鲜南部的军队的）武器和车辆让给”傀儡军队的“机会”。
