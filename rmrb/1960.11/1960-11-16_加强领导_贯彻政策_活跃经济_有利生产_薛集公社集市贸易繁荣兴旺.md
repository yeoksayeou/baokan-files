    Strengthen Leadership, Implement Policies, Activate the Economy, Benefit Production
    Xueji Commune's Market Trade is Flourishing
    (Reported by our newspaper) According to the Hubei Daily, the rural market trade in the Xueji People's Commune in Guanghua County has played a positive role in activating the rural economy and promoting production development, and is welcomed by the majority of commune members.
    Xueji Commune has two larger market towns—Xueji and Qinji. Every market day, especially on commune members' holidays, the streets are crowded and trade is very prosperous. Commune members from nearby production teams bring various fresh vegetables, dried vegetables, fish, chickens, ducks, rabbits, piglets, and household handicraft products such as brooms to the market. Commune members trade with each other, buying and selling. In addition to materials subject to state unified purchase and sale, the remaining products of the commune, production teams, production groups, and commune members after fulfilling their sales tasks to the state are often brought to the market for trading. The income from selling products is used to purchase daily necessities, small production tools, and other items, and the remainder is deposited in the town's bank savings office. Labor model Wang Changyou, a family of three, in addition to actively participating in collective production, has three fen of private plots and has reclaimed two fen of wasteland in front of and behind the house, planting a total of three fen of sweet potatoes, with sorghum planted on the ridges. He usually gathers leaves and weeds to feed a sow and a ewe. His family often sells piglets and lambs at the market to buy what they need.
    In addition to some sideline products from commune members' families being traded in the market, production teams and production groups also often sell some products in the market. Many vegetables that are not consumed by the mess hall's basic vegetable gardens are sold at the market, and the income is used for the mess hall's oil and salt expenses, or for the collective use of the team. More is directly distributed to the commune members.
    The market trade here is conducted under the leadership of state-owned commerce. The market has an exchange—the Farmers' Service Department. The exchange guides market transactions based on national purchasing and sales policies and local production and sales conditions. For larger transactions between commune members, the exchange's traders can be asked to set a price. To facilitate commune members, the exchange also purchases some products from commune members that have not been sold in the market on behalf of state commercial departments, or accepts commissions from commune members to sell or purchase certain products. This practice allows commune members to avoid having to go to the market frequently or spending too much time in the towns, greatly saving time.

    薛集公社集市贸易繁荣兴旺
    本报讯　据湖北日报消息：光化县薛集人民公社的农村集市贸易市场，在活跃农村经济，促进生产发展方面起了良好作用，受到广大社员的欢迎。
    薛集公社有两个较大的集镇—薛集和秦集。每逢集日，特别是社员的假日，街道上人来人往，贸易十分繁荣。附近各生产队的社员们带着他们自己生产的各种鲜菜、干菜以及鱼、鸡、鸭、兔、小猪，还有扫帚等家庭手工产品等来到市场。社员们互相交易，有买有卖。除国家统购统销物资以外，公社、生产队、生产小队和社员在完成向国家的交售任务以后的剩余产品，都常拿到集市上交易。他们出卖产品的收入除购买生活用品、小型生产工具和其他东西外，还就近储存在镇上的银行储蓄所里。劳动模范王长友，一家三口，除了积极参加集体生产以外，自己有三分自留地，并在屋前屋后开了两分荒地，共种了三分地的甘薯，地埂上带着高粱，平时又拣树叶、铲杂草，喂了一头母猪和一头母羊。他家经常在集市上出卖小猪、小羊，买回自己需要的东西。
    除了社员家庭的一部分副业产品在集市上交易外，生产队和生产小队也经常在集市上出售一部分产品。许多食堂基本菜地吃不完的菜，拿到集市上出售，收入除作食堂油盐钱，或小队集体使用外，多的还直接分给社员。
    这里的集市贸易是在国营商业的领导下进行的。市场上设有交易所——农民服务部。交易所根据国家购销政策，结合当地产销情况，指导市场的交易。社员间较大的交易，可以请交易所的交易员作价。交易所为方便社员，还为国家商业部门代购一部分社员在集市上没有卖出去的产品，或者接受社员委托代售或代购某些产品。这种作法使社员们不需要经常赶集，或在集镇上耽误过久，大大节省了时间。
