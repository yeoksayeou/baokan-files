Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, November 11th: The Executive Committee meeting of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization opened here on the 10th.

Attending the meeting were approximately fifty representatives from twenty Afro-Asian countries.

The agenda adopted at the meeting included: the work report of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization; the struggle of the people of Afro-Asian countries against colonialism and imperialism; and organizational issues.

Lebanese Minister of Education, Kamal Jumblatt, attending the meeting in his capacity as Chairman of the Lebanese Progressive Socialist Party, was elected Chairman of the meeting.

Youssef el-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, gave a report on the work of the Secretariat since the Second Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Conference held in Conakry. In his report, he called on the people of Afro-Asian countries to strengthen unity and cooperation in order to fight the common enemy – imperialism. The report supported the Algerian people's struggle for independence, supported Lumumba's government in the Congo, and condemned U.S. imperialism's interference in the Congo's internal affairs through the United Nations. Sebai pointed out, "Lessons learned from past experience, especially from the past few months, clearly show that imperialists try their best to use the United Nations to achieve their own purposes."

Sebai emphasized that "mainly due to obstruction by the United States, the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations has not been restored, and the Mongolian People's Republic has not been able to enter the United Nations."

He stressed, "In order to win the final victory in the common struggle against imperialism, the people of Afro-Asian countries must mainly rely on the people's struggle and solidarity, and rely on mutual encouragement and support among themselves. They must resolutely expose and smash the various conspiracies of the imperialists and continue to expose and oppose imperialism's use of the United Nations and other international organizations as tools to deceive the people and promote their evil imperialist policies."

At the meeting on the 10th, representatives from many countries spoke, strongly condemning imperialist aggression and expressing support for the just struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism and for national independence.

In his speech, Chinese representative Ji Chao-ding reviewed the decisions of the Conakry Conference, which pointed out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Afro-Asian people, and the importance of the principle of relying on the power of the people in the anti-imperialist struggle. He said, "Since the end of the Conakry Conference, the movement for liberation and national independence has developed greatly in Afro-Asian countries, especially in Africa. This is the result of the unity of the Afro-Asian people and their persistent struggle against imperialism and colonialism."

He condemned the United States for using the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of various countries, citing the Congo as an example. He said, "The United Nations has long been manipulated to deviate from its charter and become a tool of the U.S. war and aggression policy." He emphasized that U.S. imperialism is the enemy of national independence of all countries, and as long as the United Nations is controlled by U.S. imperialism, the Afro-Asian people should never place their hopes for liberation and world peace on the United Nations. They should rely on their own unity to carry out their common cause and must rely on the power of the people to wage a resolute struggle against imperialism headed by the United States.

He strongly criticized U.S. imperialism's attempt to infiltrate Africa in military, political, economic and cultural aspects in order to replace the old colonialists.

He also strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's occupation of China's territory Taiwan and its conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

Habib Mohammed, head of the Algerian delegation, recounted the heroic struggle of the Algerian people in his speech. He condemned French imperialism for massacring the Algerian people with the support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headed by the United States. He expressed his firm belief that the Algerian people will win the final victory in the struggle for complete independence and called on Afro-Asian countries to help the Algerian people's struggle.

Camara Bengari, head of the Guinean delegation, pointed out that the people of Afro-Asian countries have played and continue to play a major role in overthrowing imperialist rule.

Sato, head of the Japanese delegation, spoke about the great victory achieved by the Japanese people of all strata in opposing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." He said that the Japanese people are determined to abolish this treaty and force the United States to withdraw its military bases in Japan.

Sunito, head of the Indonesian delegation, strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's interference in the Congo through the United Nations and U.S. interference in Laos in his speech. He also revealed that "the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is conspiring and instigating counter-revolutionary rebellions in Indonesia."

Mirzo Tursun-Zade, head of the Soviet delegation, said in his speech that the Soviet people are willing to unite with the Afro-Asian people to fight against imperialism and colonialism. He also said that Taiwan must be returned to China and China's legitimate rights in the United Nations should be restored.

Pham Hong, head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, supported and praised the just struggle of the Lao people against U.S. imperialism in his speech. He demanded that U.S. military personnel withdraw from South Vietnam.

Vera Ambiso, head of the Kenyan delegation, criticized the military bases of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in his speech and demanded that the British colonial authorities release Jomo Kenyatta, the leader of the Kenya African National Union.

A letter from Congolese Prime Minister Lumumba to the meeting was also read at the meeting. In his letter, Prime Minister Lumumba condemned imperialism for carrying out various conspiracies, divisive activities and tricks in the Congo and asked Afro-Asian countries to support the Congo's national struggle.

The heads of delegations from Iraq, the United Arab Republic, Cameroon, Morocco, Southern Rhodesia, India, Yemen, Tunisia, Somalia and other countries also spoke at the meeting on the 10th.

    西巴伊强调指出，“主要是由于美国的阻挠，中华人民共和国在联合国的合法席位未能恢复，蒙古人民共和国也未能进入联合国。”
    他强调说，“为了在共同反对帝国主义的斗争中赢得最后的胜利，亚非各国人民必须主要依靠人民的斗争和团结，依靠他们之间的互相鼓舞和支持。他们必须坚决地揭露和粉碎帝国主义者的各式各样的阴谋，并继续揭露和反对帝国主义在利用联合国和其它国际组织作为工具来欺骗人民，并推行他们的罪恶的帝国主义政策。”
