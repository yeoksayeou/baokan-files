Ninety-eight representatives from various regions and sects of Tibet attended the meeting.

In their speeches at the meeting, Buddhists unanimously expressed their gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and the government's policy of religious freedom, as well as the proper preservation of the temples' cultural relics and historic sites. They also thanked the government for implementing redemption for the surplus means of production occupied by monasteries that did not participate in the rebellion during the Democratic Reform, and for providing care for the lives of patriotic and law-abiding lamas. Using their own experiences and a large number of facts, the Buddhists sternly refuted the slander of imperialism and foreign reactionaries who accused the Chinese Communist Party of destroying religion in Tibet. Pabala Gelleg Namgyal, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and Great Living Buddha of Qamdo Monastery, attended the meeting and delivered a speech.

The resolution passed at the meeting called on people in Tibetan Buddhist circles to strengthen unity within the Buddhist community, implement the government's policy of religious freedom, actively participate in anti-imperialist and patriotic activities and the social reform movement, study the various policies and laws of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and contribute to the construction of a democratic and socialist new Tibet.
