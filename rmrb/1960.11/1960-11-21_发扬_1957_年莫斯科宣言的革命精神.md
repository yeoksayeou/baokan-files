    The Moscow Declaration and the Peace Manifesto adopted by the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties have been published for a full three years. These are two documents of historical significance. Over the past three years, these two documents have played a tremendous and positive role in the struggle of the people of the world for peace, democracy, national independence, and socialism.
    The Moscow Declaration pointed out that "the main content of our time is the transition from capitalism to socialism, initiated by the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia." "Socialism is on the rise, while imperialism is in decline." "The development of socialism and the national liberation movement has dramatically accelerated the process of the decline of imperialism." The facts of the past three years have further confirmed these correct assertions.
    The major events that have occurred in the world over the past three years are:
    The socialist camp, which accounts for one-third of the world's population, is growing stronger day by day. It is economically prosperous, and its industry and agriculture are developing rapidly. After the Soviet Union first successfully launched an artificial earth satellite in 1957, it achieved many new achievements in the science and technology of conquering the universe, leaving the most developed capitalist countries far behind.
    In sharp contrast to the situation in the socialist camp, the imperialist camp is declining day by day. The United States experienced its third post-war economic crisis in 1957-1958, and is currently facing a new economic crisis. The struggle among several major capitalist countries for re-division of the capitalist world market has become more acute.
    The policy of aggression and war pursued by the imperialist bloc headed by the United States has been repeatedly frustrated. The political power of the imperialist camp is weakening. American imperialism, which is at odds with the people of the world, is surrounded by the people of the world.
    The movement of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and for national independence and democratic freedom has made great progress. The victory of the Cuban Revolution, the declaration of independence by a series of African countries, the heroic struggles of the people of Algeria, the people of Iraq, the people of South Korea, the people of Laos, and the people of Turkey against imperialism and its running dogs, and the heroic struggles of the Japanese people against American imperialism and its running dogs, all these mark a new upsurge in the national independence movement.
    In the capitalist countries of Western Europe and North America, the working class and the working people are conducting extensive struggles for the rights of life and democratic rights, and economic and political strike movements are rising one after another.
    The world peace movement, in which the broad masses of the people participate, is developing day by day. A broad united front against imperialism and in defense of world peace is expanding.
    The development of the situation over the past three years shows that socialist forces have further surpassed imperialist forces, national liberation forces have further surpassed colonialism forces, people's forces have further surpassed reactionary forces, and peace forces have further surpassed war forces. This proves that Comrade Mao Zedong's famous assertion three years ago that "the East wind prevails over the West wind" is completely correct.
    In a word, the whole situation is very favorable to the people of the world and unfavorable to imperialism and all reactionaries. All views that overestimate the strength of imperialism and underestimate the strength of the people are contrary to the Moscow Declaration and are completely wrong.
    The Moscow Declaration exposed the inherent contradictions of the imperialist system and the aggressive nature of imperialism. The declaration said:
    "In the imperialist countries, the contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production are sharpening." "The capitalist economy cannot avoid new and profound shocks and crises."
    "In most of the capitalist world, especially in the colonies and semi-colonies, hundreds of millions of workers still live in poverty."
    "Increasingly acute contradictions exist, not merely between the bourgeoisie and the working class, but also between the monopoly bourgeoisie and all sections among the people, and between the American monopoly bourgeoisie and the people, and even the bourgeoisie, of other capitalist countries."
    The Moscow Declaration also pointed out that "the aggressive imperialist circles of the United States are striving to rule most of the countries in the world on the strength of the so-called 'position of strength' policy, and are attempting to hinder mankind from advancing according to the laws of social development." Therefore, "these circles have become the center of world reactionary forces and the most ferocious enemy of the masses of the people."
    Based on these correct analyses, the Moscow Declaration drew the following correct conclusion:
    "As long as imperialism exists, there will be soil for aggressive wars."
    At the same time, the Peace Manifesto also correctly pointed out:
    "Where does the threat to the cause of peace and the threat to the security of the people of all countries come from? It comes from the monopoly capitalist groups who are keen on war and fantasize about war and who have made a fortune in the two world wars and in the current arms race."
    The Peace Manifesto said very rightly:
    "Neither any communist party nor any socialist country has the motive to launch a war or carry out a military attack on another country, nor does it have the motive to plunder the land of another country. The Soviet Union and People's China themselves possess vast lands and countless natural resources. There are no classes or social strata keen on war in all socialist countries."
    These arguments are Marxist-Leninist truths. Our socialist camp countries have always opposed imperialism launching wars, adhered to a peaceful foreign policy, and advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. However, modern revisionists, represented by the traitor Tito clique, in order to serve imperialism, deliberately confuse right and wrong, on the one hand propagating that imperialism will "give up war," and on the other hand shamelessly slandering socialist countries as "yearning for war." This once again exposed their true colors as running dogs of imperialism.
    Precisely because there is still a danger of imperialism launching wars in the world, the Moscow Declaration pointed out: "The people of all countries in the world must maintain the greatest vigilance against the danger of war caused by imperialism."
    The Moscow Declaration said, "The Communist Parties of all countries consider the struggle for peace as their primary task. They will, together with all peace-loving forces, do their utmost to prevent war."
    The Moscow Declaration also said: "At present, the forces of peace have grown greatly, and it is practically possible to prevent war."
    Therefore, the task of the people of all countries is to turn the possibility of preventing world war into a reality.
    The Moscow Declaration pointed out that to prevent world war and strive for lasting world peace, it is necessary to rely on the joint struggle of the socialist camp and all peace-loving forces. It said: "Maintaining the cause of peace are these powerful forces of our time: the indestructible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union; the peace-loving countries of Asia and Africa which stand on the anti-imperialist position and, together with the socialist countries, constitute a vast area of peace; the international working class, first and foremost its vanguard—the Communist Parties; the liberation movement of the people of the colonies and semi-colonies; the mass movement of the people of all countries in the world striving for peace. Resolutely resisting the plot of a new war are also the people of the countries in Europe that have declared neutrality, the people of Latin America, and the masses of the people in the imperialist countries. The united strength of these powerful forces can stop the outbreak of war. If the imperialist warmongers insist on launching a war regardless of everything, then imperialism is doomed to perish, because the people will never continue to tolerate the system that brings them such great pain and sacrifice."
    That is to say, only by constantly strengthening the socialist camp, strengthening the national liberation movement, strengthening the struggles of the people of capitalist countries, strengthening the forces of all peace-loving people, and strengthening the unity of all these forces to carry out a common struggle, can peace be maintained most effectively. The broader and stronger this united front of peace forces against imperialism launching wars, and the more developed and in-depth the struggle, the more guaranteed world peace will be.
    The strength and unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union is the main force against imperialism and in defense of world peace. At the same time, the movement to defend world peace and the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries for national liberation, democratic freedom, and socialism are interconnected, consistent, and complementary. The development and victory of the liberation movement and revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and oppressed people of the world are a vast force in stopping imperialism from launching wars and defending world peace.
    After the end of World War II, American imperialism once attempted to use the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries to fight a civil war, eliminate the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people, and turn China into its colony and a military base for attacking the Soviet Union and invading Asia. However, the Chinese people were forced to carry out a patriotic self-defense revolutionary war, and finally defeated the attack of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and shattered the wild plan of American imperialism to invade China. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution greatly strengthened the forces defending world peace. The development and victory of the people's revolutionary movements in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have also proved this point. Therefore, the view that opposes the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries to the struggle to defend world peace is very wrong.
    Marxism-Leninism has always held that revolution cannot be exported or imported. The revolutions of the people of all countries are the result of the development of class struggle, and are produced by the revolutionary consciousness and revolutionary demands of the people of their own countries. All oppressed nations and oppressed people will eventually rise up in revolution, and the socialist system will eventually replace the capitalist system. The Moscow Declaration said it well:
    "The policies pursued by these anti-people, imperialist, aggressive forces are digging their own graves and creating their own gravediggers."
    The Moscow Declaration also said: "The situation in which the working people of capitalist countries currently find themselves is making them more and more convinced that socialism is the only way out of their disastrous situation."
    This is an objective law of social development that no one can change.
    The Moscow Declaration summarized the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction. These laws are: "The working class, headed by the Marxist-Leninist party, leads the working masses in proletarian revolution in this or that form, and establishes proletarian dictatorship in this or that form; establishes an alliance of the working class with the basic masses of the peasantry and other working strata; eliminates capitalist ownership of basic means of production and establishes public ownership of basic means of production; gradually realizes the socialist transformation of agriculture; plans to develop the national economy, so as to build socialism and communism, and improve the living standards of the working people; carries out socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural fields, creating a strong intellectual contingent loyal to the working class, the working people, and the cause of socialism; eliminates national oppression and establishes equality and fraternal friendship between all nations; defends the fruits of socialism, preventing it from being violated by enemies at home and abroad; and practices proletarian internationalism, uniting with the working class of all countries." These laws are not only applicable to countries that have already embarked on the socialist road, but are also a guide for the people of all countries to carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction in the future.
    The entire doctrine of Marxism-Leninism is to serve the world proletariat and the revolutions of the people of all countries. The revolutionary spirit is the soul of Marxism-Leninism. The combination of a rigorous scientific spirit and a high revolutionary spirit is an inherent feature of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. To adhere to the theoretical position of Marxism-Leninism and adhere to the banner of the Moscow Declaration, we must defend and promote this scientific spirit and revolutionary spirit. The new developments of history and the new experiences of class struggle constantly require us to make new summaries based on the basic principles and basic methods of Marxism-Leninism and based on the scientific analysis of objective things, to guide the revolutionary struggle and enrich the content of Marxism-Leninism. However, when studying new situations and new experiences, we must never deviate from the basic principles and basic methods of Marxism-Leninism, and we must never disregard the facts. Otherwise, it would be a fundamental violation of Marxism-Leninism.
    The Moscow Declaration pointed out, "It is necessary to resolutely overcome revisionism and dogmatism in the ranks of the Communist and Workers' Parties." It also clearly pointed out, "Under present conditions, the main danger is revisionism." The characteristic of revisionism is to castrate the revolutionary spirit of Marxist-Leninist doctrine. Imperialism and reactionaries of all countries are always constantly exerting influence on the working class in order to save their declining fate. All kinds of revisionists always use some kind of new situation to distort and tamper with the revolutionary doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, so as to lead the working class away from the correct path of revolutionary class struggle, so as to adapt to the needs of imperialism and reactionaries of all countries.
    The struggle against revisionism is a long-term one. Since the publication of the 1957 Moscow Declaration, the international communist movement has achieved great victories in the struggle against modern revisionism. Modern revisionism has been discredited, but it has not been completely crushed. Yugoslav modern revisionists are still frantically attacking Marxism-Leninism, clamoring that Marxism-Leninism is "outdated." The more imperialism declines, the more it will use revisionists to spread poison among the masses, in an attempt to weaken and disintegrate the people's fighting will. Therefore, carrying out an irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionism is still an important task for communists in all countries today.
    Like all progressive movements in human history, the communist movement will inevitably encounter various difficulties. However, Marxism-Leninism, which reflects the laws of historical development and is full of revolutionary spirit, is invincible. The Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries will, on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and on the basis of the Moscow Declaration, constantly strengthen their unity, and together with the working class and the broad masses of the people of all countries, constantly overcome all obstacles on the tortuous road forward, and promote new and great victories in the cause of peace, democracy, national liberation, and socialism.

### 发扬1957年莫斯科宣言的革命精神

    发扬1957年莫斯科宣言的革命精神
    各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议所通过的莫斯科宣言和和平宣言，已经发表整整三年了。这是两个具有历史意义的文件。三年来，这两个文件对全世界人民争取和平、民主、民族独立和社会主义的斗争，起了巨大的积极作用。
    莫斯科宣言指出，“我们时代的主要内容是由俄国伟大十月社会主义革命所开始的由资本主义向社会主义的过渡。”“社会主义在向上发展，而帝国主义却在衰退。”“社会主义和民族解放运动的发展，剧烈地加速了帝国主义的没落过程。”三年来的事实进一步地证实了这些正确的论断。
    三年来世界上发生的主要事件是：
    占世界人口三分之一的社会主义阵营一天天更加强大。它在经济上欣欣向荣，工农业迅速发展。苏联于1957年首先发射人造地球卫星成功之后，又在征服宇宙的科学技术方面获得许多新的成就，把最发达的资本主义国家远远地抛在后边。
    同社会主义阵营的景况恰恰相反，帝国主义阵营一天天更加衰落。美国在1957—1958年发生了战后第三次经济危机，目前又面临一次新的经济危机。几个主要资本主义国家为重新瓜分资本主义世界市场的斗争更加尖锐化。
    以美国为首的帝国主义集团所实行的侵略政策和战争政策，不断遭受挫败。帝国主义阵营的政治力量正在削弱。与全世界人民为敌的美帝国主义正处于全世界人民的包围之中。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反对帝国主义、争取民族独立和民主自由的运动，有了巨大的发展。古巴革命的胜利，一系列非洲国家的宣布独立，阿尔及利亚人民，伊拉克人民，南朝鲜人民，老挝人民和土耳其人民反对帝国主义及其走狗的英勇斗争，日本人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的英勇斗争，所有这些，标志着民族独立运动进入一个新高涨的时期。
    在西欧和北美的资本主义国家，工人阶级和劳动人民为了争取生活权利和民主权利进行广泛的斗争，经济性和政治性的罢工运动此起彼伏。
    有广大人民群众参加的世界和平运动日益发展。反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的广泛的统一战线正在扩大。
    三年来的形势发展说明了，社会主义力量进一步超过帝国主义力量，民族解放力量进一步超过殖民主义力量，人民力量进一步超过反动力量，和平力量进一步超过战争力量。这就证明了毛泽东同志在三年前所作的一个著名论断，即“东风压倒西风”，是完全正确的。
    一句话，整个形势十分有利于全世界人民，而不利于帝国主义和一切反动派。一切过高估计帝国主义力量、过低估计人民力量的观点，都是违背莫斯科宣言的，都是完全错误的。
    莫斯科宣言揭露了帝国主义制度所固有的各种矛盾和帝国主义的侵略本性。宣言说：
    “在帝国主义各国，生产力和生产关系之间的矛盾尖锐化了。”“资本主义经济不能避免新的、深刻的震动和危机。”
    “在资本主义世界的大部分，特别是殖民地和半殖民地，千百万的劳动者仍然过着贫困的生活。”
    “日趋尖锐的矛盾不仅存在于资产阶级和工人阶级之间，而且存在于垄断资产阶级和人民的各个阶层之间，存在于美国的垄断资产阶级和其他资本主义国家的人民以至资产阶级之间。”
    莫斯科宣言又指出，“美国的帝国主义侵略集团，力图依靠所谓‘实力地位’政策统治世界上的大多数国家，并且企图阻挠人类按照社会发展规律前进。”因此，“这些集团就成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众的最凶恶的敌人。”
    根据这些正确的分析，莫斯科宣言得出这样正确的结论：
    “只要帝国主义还存在，就有发生侵略战争的土壤。”
    同时，和平宣言也正确地指出：
    “对和平事业的威胁，对各国人民安全的威胁是来自何处呢？热中于战争的和幻想战争的是在两次世界大战中、在目前的军备竞赛中大发横财的垄断资本集团。”
    和平宣言说得很对：
    “无论哪一个共产党或是哪一个社会主义国家，都没有发动战争和对别国进行军事攻击的动机，都没有掠夺别国土地的动机。苏联、人民中国自己就拥有辽阔的土地和无数的自然财富。在所有社会主义国家都没有热中于战争的阶级或社会阶层。”
    这些论断是马克思列宁主义的真理。我们社会主义阵营各国，一贯反对帝国主义发动战争，坚持和平外交政策，主张实行不同社会制度国家的和平共处。但是，以叛徒铁托集团为代表的现代修正主义者，为了替帝国主义效劳，却故意颠倒黑白，一边宣扬说什么帝国主义会“放弃战争”，一边无耻地诬蔑社会主义国家“渴望战争”。这再一次暴露了他们的帝国主义走狗的本来面目。
    正是由于世界上还存在着帝国主义发动战争的危险，莫斯科宣言指出：“世界各国人民对于帝国主义所造成的战争危险必须保持最大的警惕。”
    莫斯科宣言说，“各国共产党认为，争取和平的斗争是自己的首要任务。它们将同一切爱好和平的力量在一起，竭尽全力来防止战争。”
    莫斯科宣言又说：“目前，和平的力量已经大大成长，已经有实际可能来防止战争”。
    因此，各国人民的任务就是要把防止世界战争的可能性变为现实性。
    莫斯科宣言指出，要防止世界战争，争取世界持久和平，就必须依靠社会主义阵营力量和一切爱好和平力量的联合斗争。它说：“维护着和平事业的是当代的这些强大的力量：不可摧毁的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营；站在反帝立场上并且同社会主义国家一起构成广大和平地区的亚非爱好和平的国家；国际工人阶级，首先是它的先锋队——共产党；殖民地和半殖民地人民的解放运动；世界各国人民争取和平的群众运动。坚决反抗新战争的策划的，还有欧洲宣布中立各国的人民，拉丁美洲的人民以及帝国主义国家的人民群众。这些强大力量的联合可以阻止战争的爆发。如果帝国主义的战争狂人硬要不顾一切发动战争，那么帝国主义就注定灭亡，因为人民绝不会再继续容忍那个给他们带来如此惨重的痛苦和牺牲的制度。”
    这就是说，只有不断地加强社会主义阵营，加强民族解放运动，加强资本主义各国人民的斗争，加强一切爱好和平人民的力量，加强所有这些力量的团结，进行共同的斗争，才能够最有效地维护和平。这个反对帝国主义发动战争的和平力量的统一战线越广泛、越强大，斗争越发展、越深入，世界和平就越有保障。
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的强大和团结，是反对帝国主义、保卫世界和平的主要力量。同时，保卫世界和平运动同各国人民争取民族解放、民主自由和社会主义的革命斗争，是互相联系着的，是一致的，是相辅相成的。世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放运动的发展和革命斗争的胜利，是制止帝国主义发动战争和保卫世界和平的广大力量。
    在第二次世界大战结束以后，美帝国主义曾经企图利用蒋介石反动派打内战，消灭中国人民的革命力量，把中国变为它的殖民地，变为进攻苏联和侵略亚洲的军事基地。但是，中国人民被迫进行了爱国自卫的革命战争，终于打败了蒋介石反动派的进攻，粉碎了美帝国主义侵略中国的狂妄计划。中国人民革命的胜利，大大增强了保卫世界和平的力量。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家的人民革命运动的发展和胜利，同样证明了这一点。因此，那种把各国人民的革命斗争同保卫世界和平的斗争对立起来的观点，是十分错误的。
    马克思列宁主义历来认为，革命不能输出和输入，各国人民的革命都是阶级斗争发展的结果，是由本国人民的革命觉悟和革命要求而产生的。一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民终归要起来革命，社会主义制度终归要代替资本主义制度。莫斯科宣言说得对：
    “这些反人民的帝国主义侵略势力所实行的政策使它们自取灭亡，自己造成埋葬自己的掘墓人。”
    莫斯科宣言又说：“资本主义国家的劳动人民目前所处的境遇，使他们越来越相信，只有社会主义才是他们摆脱灾难深重的处境的唯一出路。”
    这是任何人都改变不了的社会发展的客观规律。
    莫斯科宣言总结了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律。这些规律是：“以马克思列宁主义政党为核心的工人阶级，领导劳动群众进行这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级革命，建立这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级专政；建立工人阶级同农民基本群众和其他劳动阶层的联盟；消灭基本生产资料资本主义所有制和建立基本生产资料的公有制；逐步实现农业的社会主义改造；有计划地发展国民经济，以便建成社会主义和共产主义，提高劳动人民的生活水平；进行思想文化领域的社会主义革命，造成忠于工人阶级、劳动人民和社会主义事业的强大的知识分子队伍；消灭民族压迫，建立各民族间的平等和兄弟友谊；保卫社会主义果实，不让它受到国内外敌人的侵犯；实行无产阶级的国际主义，同各国工人阶级团结一致。”这些规律不仅适用于已经走上社会主义道路的国家，而且也是今后各国人民进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设的指针。
    马克思列宁主义的全部学说，是为世界无产阶级和各国人民革命服务的。革命精神是马克思列宁主义的灵魂。严格的科学精神和高度的革命精神的结合，是马克思列宁主义学说的固有特点。我们要坚持马克思列宁主义的理论阵地，坚持莫斯科宣言的旗帜，就必须保卫和发扬这种科学精神和革命精神。历史的新发展，阶级斗争的新经验，不断地要求我们根据马克思列宁主义的基本原理和基本方法，根据对客观事物的科学分析，作出新的总结，来指导革命斗争，并且丰富马克思列宁主义的内容。但是，在研究新情况和新经验的时候，决不能离开马克思列宁主义的基本原理和基本方法，决不能不顾事实。否则，就是根本违背了马克思列宁主义。
    莫斯科宣言指出，“必须在共产党和工人党的队伍中坚决克服修正主义和教条主义。”它并且明确指出：“在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义”。修正主义的特点，就是阉割马克思列宁主义学说的革命精神。帝国主义和各国反动派为了挽救他们没落的命运，总是不断地向工人阶级施加影响。形形色色的修正主义者总是利用某种新情况来歪曲和篡改马克思列宁主义的革命学说，以便使工人阶级离开革命的阶级斗争的正确道路，从而适应帝国主义和各国反动派的需要。
    反对修正主义的斗争，是长期的。自从1957年莫斯科宣言发表以来，国际共产主义运动在反对现代修正主义的斗争中已经取得重大胜利。现代修正主义已经被搞臭了，但是它还没有被彻底粉碎。南斯拉夫现代修正主义者还在疯狂地攻击马克思列宁主义，叫嚣马克思列宁主义已经“过时”。而帝国主义越是走下坡路，就越要利用修正主义者在群众中散布毒素，来企图削弱和瓦解人民的斗争意志。因此，向现代修正主义进行不调和的斗争，仍然是各国共产党人当前的重要任务。
    同人类历史上一切前进运动一样，共产主义运动也不可避免地要遇到种种困难。但是，反映了历史发展规律的、充满着革命精神的马克思列宁主义，是战无不胜的。各国共产党和工人党将在马克思列宁主义的基础上，在莫斯科宣言的基础上，不断地加强自己的团结，同各国工人阶级和广大人民一起，在曲折的前进道路上不断战胜一切障碍，促进和平、民主、民族解放和社会主义事业取得新的伟大胜利。
