Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 20th -- Industrial workers in Qin County, Shanxi Province, at both the county and commune levels, are enthusiastically engaged in a crash production campaign centered around agricultural tools for next year's spring plowing. The Qin County Party Committee has proposed equipping each agricultural laborer with five tools: a shovel, hoe, mattock, sickle, and cart; providing each management district with two items for accelerating reform: a millstone and a double-roller mill; and producing three types of indigenous machinery for each public canteen: a noodle press, a vegetable cutter, and a blower, as the goals for the crash production.

In the production of these implements, county and commune factories widely carried out a "four comparisons" competition: comparing who makes more, who makes faster, who achieves higher quality, and who uses less material. While rushing to manufacture various implements, the county agricultural machinery factory also accelerated the production of thirty belt-driven lathes to equip commune-run industries. Thanks to the close cooperation of the county and commune factories, statistics up to the 7th of this month show that the county has already manufactured 12,546 various agricultural implements, processed 319 tools, repaired a large number of existing agricultural tools, and reformed many processing tools.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th -- The Beijing Hardware and Machinery Company organized factories to supply rural areas with remaining parts and components to repair agricultural implements, powerfully supporting the suburbs' preparations for next year's production.

Before carrying out this work, the company dispatched more than 40 supply and marketing cadres to conduct investigations in rural areas of the suburbs, classifying the parts and components needed by the communes according to specifications, varieties, priorities, and urgency, and making lists of goods. Then, armed with the lists, they organized factories to supply the remaining parts and components to the rural areas. Through this meticulous organization, more than 16,000 urgently needed parts and components for the communes were resolved in about a week. By the beginning of November, the communes had repaired more than 2,200 sets/pieces of large agricultural machinery and new-style agricultural implements such as tractors, boiler-donkey engines, and seeders, and also assembled 1,800 seeders, levelers, and other machines waiting for parts. All 150 planers and drilling machines in the commune factories were also repaired after receiving parts and were immediately used to repair agricultural implements.

    沁县为每个农业劳动力配齐五件生产工具  北京五金机械公司组织工厂拿出存余配件
    据新华社太原20日电　山西省沁县的县、社工业职工热烈展开以明年春耕工具为中心的突击生产农事机具活动。中共沁县县委提出为每个农业劳动力配齐锹、镢、锄、镰、车五件工具，给每个管理区改革加速磨和双滚碾两件东西，给每个公共食堂制出压面、切菜、吹风用三部土机械，作为突击生产的目标。
    在这些机具的生产中，各县、社工厂广泛开展了比造得多、比造得快、比质量高、比用料省的“四比”竞赛。县农业机械厂在突击制造各种机具的同时，还加速赶制出三十部皮带车床，武装社办工业。由于各县、社工厂的通力协作，到本月7日统计，全县已经制造出各种农具一万二千五百四十六件，加工工具三百十九件；并且修补了大批旧有农具，改革了很多加工工具。
    据新华社20日讯　北京市五金机械公司组织工厂把存余的部件、配件，供应农村修配农具，有力地支援了郊区明年的生产准备工作。
    在进行这项工作以前，这个公司抽调了四十多名供销干部分赴郊区农村进行调查，把公社需要的部件、配件，按规格品种、轻重缓急，分类排队，制成货单。然后带上货单，组织工厂把多余的部件、配件供应农村。经过这种细致的组织工作，在一周左右就解决了公社急需的部件、配件一万六千多件。到11月上旬，各公社已经修配好拖拉机、锅驼机、播种机等大型农业机械和新式农具两千二百多台、件，还组装了正在等配件的播种机、平地机等一千八百多台。公社工厂的一百五十台刨床、钻床，也因得到配件，全部修复，立即用来修配农具。
