    From Guardsman to Outstanding Stonemason

    When people pass the Okryu Restaurant standing on the banks of the Taedong River in Pyongyang – a palace-like building built of marble and granite – they can't help but admire the exquisite craftsmanship of the stonemasons who built it. Among the stonemasons who participated in the construction of Okryu Restaurant, three young men, Cui Chengmo, Li Zihao, and Jin Yuanze, are well-known outstanding producers throughout the construction site. Surprisingly, they are not veterans in this field, but demobilized soldiers who had just left the People's Army's Guards artillery unit not long ago.

    This spring, when these three young men were demobilized together from the army and assigned to the Okryu Restaurant construction site, it happened that the foundation work for the stone wall construction was nearing completion. Because stone cutting accounted for 40% of the entire project, the construction site leaders transferred personnel with some stonemasonry skills from various groups to the stone cutting department, but they still felt manpower was insufficient. As soon as these three young men heard about this situation, they asked the leaders to allow them to participate in this battle. However, the construction site leaders knew that they had never done stonemasonry work and were prepared to assign them to other departments.

      "Guardsmen should devote themselves to the most difficult work!" After discussing this, the three young men decided to continue striving to go to the stone cutting department. They made another request to the construction site leaders and were approved to be transferred together to work in the first stonemasonry team.

    When the three young men reported to the first stonemasonry team leader, the leader glanced at them over the rim of his glasses and said, "Young men, try to take a look! Our work is not simple." Then, he said encouragingly, "You were guardsmen in the past, I believe you can complete the task."

    The young men were assigned to chisel granite, and initially, they were not given any work quotas. Ordinary technicians had to chisel ten pieces of granite every day, while these three novices tried their best but could not chisel even a few pieces each day. However, "Do not forget the glorious title of Guardsman." This oath encouraged them to constantly overcome all difficulties. Soon, the technical level of the three people gradually improved, and they could chisel eight or nine pieces of granite a day. These three young men were not satisfied. They were determined to create advanced results.

    One day, it rained heavily, and night had fallen, and the stonemasons had all stopped working. However, these three young men took advantage of this time to conduct a "night raid." Until late at night, the sound of them chiseling stones could still be heard from the construction site. That night, the three of them chiseled a total of eighteen pieces of granite. For several days in a row, they studied and worked hard at night. Soon, their technology greatly improved, and they could keep up with ordinary technicians even without doing "night raids."

    One day, a newsletter was posted on the construction site: "Comrades Cui Chengmo, Li Zihao, and Jin Yuanze, former guardsmen, achieved a daily output of sixteen pieces today!"

    After seeing the newsletter, the team leader happily said to the comrades in the team, "Guardsmen are really good!" Then he said to the young men, "Young men, don't be proud of sixteen pieces of granite."

    "No, we are just new recruits! We are determined to do better in the future!" The three young men said in unison, just like seeing their superiors in the army.

    Indeed, they have been doing very well. On the construction site of Okryu Restaurant, they have always stood in the advanced ranks of the stonemasonry team. (Fei) (Attached picture)

    从近卫兵到出色的石工
    当人们经过矗立在平壤市大同江畔的玉流馆——这座用大理石和花岗石砌成的宫殿般的建筑时，都会对修建这座建筑的石工们的精巧手艺表示钦佩。在参加玉流馆建设的石工中，崔承模、李子浩和金元泽这三个青年是全工地闻名的优秀生产者。可是，令人惊异的是，他们都不是干这行的老手，而是刚离开人民军近卫炮兵部队不久的转业军人。
    今年春天，当这三个年青人一起从部队里复员而被分配到玉流馆建筑工地的时候，恰好工地上砌筑石墙的基础工程快要完成了。由于凿石工程占整个工程的40％，工地领导上虽然把各个小组里稍微懂一些石工技术的人员都调到凿石部门去，但是人手还感到不足。这三个小伙子一听到这种情况，就要求领导同志让他们参加这场战斗。可是，工地领导知道他们没有做过石工活，准备把他们分配到其它部门去。
      “近卫兵应当投身到最困难的工作中去！”这三个青年商量以后，决定仍然要争取到凿石部门去。他们再一次向工地领导提出请求，结果被批准一起调到第一石工班工作。
    第一石工班班长在这三个青年刚来报到时，从他那眼镜框边瞟了他们一眼说：“小伙子们试着瞧吧！我们的活儿可不简单哩。”接着，他又带着鼓励的口气说：“你们过去是近卫兵，我相信，你们可以完成任务。”
    小伙子们被分配去凿花岗石，开始时并没有给他们规定工作定额。一般技工每天都要凿十块花岗石，而这三个新手每天拼命干，还凿不了几块。但是，“不要忘记了近卫兵的光荣称号”。这个誓言鼓舞着他们不断地克服一切困难。不久，他们三个人的技术水平逐渐有了提高，一天能凿八、九块花岗石了。这三个小伙子并没有感到满足。他们决心要创造出先进的成绩来。
    一天，大雨倾盆，黑夜已临，石工们都纷纷下工了。但是，这三个小伙子却乘这个时候进行“夜袭”。直到夜深时，工地上还传出他们凿石的声音。这一夜，他们三个共凿出了十八块花岗石。连着好几天，他们都在夜间苦学苦干。不久，他们的技术大大提高，就是不作“夜袭”也能赶上一般技工了。
    一天，工地上贴出了一张快报：“过去的近卫兵崔承模、李子浩和金元泽三位同志，今天日产量达到了十六块！”
    班长看到快报后，高兴地对班里的同志说：“近卫兵真不错啊！”接着又对小伙子说：“小伙子们可不要为十六块花岗石而骄傲呀。”
    “不，我们才是新兵！我们决心今后要干得更好！”三个小伙子就像在部队里见着首长一样地齐声说。
    的确，他们一直干得很好。在玉流馆的工地上，他们一直站在石工班的先进行列中。（芾）（附图片）
