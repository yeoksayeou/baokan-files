Universally Implement the System of Stationing Rural Financial and Trade Personnel in Production Teams

The financial and trade departments send cadres to be stationed permanently in production teams, going to production to support production, going among the masses to organize people's lives, and going to the front line of agricultural production to complete financial and trade tasks. This is a very meaningful new working method implemented by the Matou People's Commune in Wuqing County, Hebei Province.

The financial and trade departments have a large and sound organization in our vast rural areas. It is a bridge connecting cities and villages, industry and agriculture, and the state and the collective, and has extensive and close ties with agricultural production and the lives of more than 500 million farmers. Therefore, how well the financial and trade work is done has a significant impact on the entire rural economy. After the rural people's communes were established, the degree of collectivization of production and life has greatly increased, and the content of operations of the financial and trade departments has become more and more extensive, and the workload has also increased. It must both serve production, vigorously support agricultural production and technological transformation, and serve the consumption of rural people, comprehensively organize and arrange the lives of the vast number of commune members; it must both help the commune do a good job in income and distribution, and do a good job in the state's procurement of agricultural and sideline products and other financial and trade work. The Party's and the people's policy of vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain requires the financial and trade departments to more consciously, comprehensively, universally and persistently give strong support to agriculture. This is the new situation facing rural financial and trade work.

How can the financial and trade departments adapt to this new situation and better complete various financial and trade tasks? The Matou Commune's financial and trade department's dispatch of cadres to be stationed permanently in production teams provides us with a good method. Similar practices also exist in other regions. The production team is the basic accounting unit of the people's commune, and rural production, life, and many tasks must be carried out through the production team. The production team is not only the basic unit of production of the people's commune, but also the basic unit for arranging the lives of commune members. To do a good job in rural financial and trade work, it is obviously necessary to regard the production team as the basic position for rural financial and trade activities. In the past, many regions also implemented the practice of sending cadres from financial and trade departments to production teams, but at that time it was mainly a temporary measure taken to carry out certain tasks or solve certain problems. Now, the Matou Commune's financial and trade department has further sent cadres to production teams to settle down for a long time, and through a certain organizational form, it has fixed it and formed a system, which has made the financial and trade work take solid root in rural production and people's lives; at the same time, it has also made the organizational form of the financial and trade departments further adapt to the organizational form of the people's commune, which is convenient for better exerting the role of the financial and trade departments.

The function of the financial and trade departments is to organize circulation and distribution. Serving production and serving consumption through circulation and distribution activities is the basic task of the financial and trade departments. Serving production and vigorously supporting production is an indispensable condition for doing a good job in financial and trade work. Therefore, the standard for measuring the quality of financial and trade work is first of all to see whether the financial and trade personnel put supporting production in the first place, and to see whether the activities of financial and trade work are conducive to promoting the development of production. What happened after the financial and trade department of Matou Commune implemented the system of stationing financial and trade cadres in production teams? The most prominent manifestation is that the financial and trade work is more closely integrated with agricultural production and with the central work of the Party. After the cadres were stationed in the team, they not only helped the production team to vigorously carry out tool reforms and tap labor potential, helped the production team to summarize and promote advanced experiences, helped develop pig raising, helped arrange the lives of commune members, but also directly participated in field labor. That is to say, they are not only the dispatched personnel of the financial and trade department, but also the cadres who help the production team to promote production work, and also the ordinary commune members who work together with the masses. Financial and trade cadres actively participate in everything in the countryside that is conducive to promoting and developing production and conducive to increasing grain production.

Perhaps some people think that the financial and trade department is engaged in circulation and distribution. In the upsurge of the Party and the people vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain, the business work of the financial and trade department was already very heavy. And the financial and trade personnel have to devote their main energy to supporting agricultural production. Wouldn't this increase the burden on financial and trade personnel and affect the completion of financial and trade tasks? After the financial and trade cadres are stationed in the team, how should they carry out financial and trade work? Is there a contradiction between supporting agriculture and completing financial and trade tasks? On the surface, there is a contradiction, but in fact, not only is there no contradiction, but it is more conducive to the development of financial and trade work. As early as 1943, Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In financial and economic issues, county and district party and government workers should devote 90% of their energy to helping farmers increase production, and then use 10% of their energy to collect taxes from farmers. If they work hard on the former, the latter will be easy." This is exactly the case. After the financial and trade department of Wuqing County Matou People's Commune implemented the system of long-term stationing of cadres in the team, it did more than 15,000 workdays for the production team in four months. In the process of labor, the financial and trade cadres stationed in the team grasped the changes in the production and life of the masses in a timely manner, and solved the needs of the masses and the combination of financial and trade work and the central work of the Party. For example, during the preparation for summer vegetable sowing, the cadres stationed in the team learned in the labor that some commune members had vegetable seeds in stock, but some production teams could not complete the sowing task due to insufficient vegetable seeds. After they timely organized the purchase, they successively adjusted more than 7,000 catties for the production teams lacking vegetable seeds, resulting in more than 7,000 mu of vegetables being planted in the whole commune. For another example, they learned that commune members generally requested the commercial departments to regularly purchase various agricultural and sideline products. With the support of the commune party committee, the cadres stationed in the team launched a "patriotic sales day" in the whole commune. Every ten days or so, the commune members concentrated the fat pigs, fresh eggs and other products sold and handed them over to the financial and trade department. Because they put their main energy on supporting agricultural production, and grasped the situation and law of purchasing and marketing work from the process of going deep into production and deep into the masses, as a result, they overfulfilled the purchasing and marketing plan for the first half of the year and successfully completed various financial and trade tasks on the basis of developing production. It can be seen that supporting production and completing financial and trade tasks are not only not contradictory, but also become a very favorable condition for doing a good job in financial and trade work.

Financial and trade cadres devote their main energy to supporting agricultural production and arranging the lives of commune members. This does not mean that they can relax or even abandon financial and trade business. The significance of financial and trade cadres participating in field labor is not limited to adding a labor force to agricultural production. More importantly, it is necessary to understand and grasp the needs of production and life changes through participating in labor, participating in production planning and management, and participating in commune members' life arrangements. The more detailed and complete the understanding of this change and need, the more correct and timely the problems reflected, the more timely and better the financial and trade work can meet the needs of all aspects of production and life. The effectiveness of the Matou People's Commune in promoting the system of stationing financial and trade cadres in production teams is also very prominent in this regard.

After the financial and trade cadres are stationed permanently in the production team, they eat, live, work and discuss with the commune members, they can cultivate a good style of caring about production and the lives of the masses everywhere, and their thinking will be more open and their vision will be broader; this will help to further strengthen the policy viewpoint, production viewpoint and mass viewpoint, and combine their work more closely with the entire socialist construction cause. Because the financial and trade work has taken root in production and the lives of the masses, the masses are also more concerned about the financial and trade work. This has further developed the mass line of financial and trade work under the new situation.

In general, the implementation of the system of stationing financial and trade cadres in production teams is not only a major reform in the organizational system and working methods of financial and trade work, but also an important step in improving the work style of cadres and improving the ideological level of financial and trade cadres, and an effective measure for further implementing the Party's mass line in financial and trade work. The implementation of the system of stationing financial and trade cadres in production teams is by no means the business of a few stationed cadres in the rural financial and trade departments. All employees of the rural financial and trade departments and the higher-level financial and trade departments should improve their work around this reform, so as to continuously consolidate and develop the system of stationing cadres in the team, and continuously develop and improve the rural financial and trade work.

### 普遍推行农村财贸人员驻队制度

    普遍推行农村财贸人员驻队制度
    财贸部门派干部常驻生产队，到生产中支援生产，到群众中组织人民生活，到农业生产第一线去完成财贸任务。这是河北省武清县码头人民公社实行的一项很有意义的新的工作方法。
    财贸部门在我国广大农村有着庞大而健全的机构，它是联结城市和乡村、工业和农业、国家和集体的桥梁，和农业生产以及五亿多农民的生活有着十分广泛而密切的联系。因此，财贸工作做得如何，对整个农村经济有着重大的影响。农村人民公社化以后，生产和生活的集体化程度大大提高了，财贸部门经营的内容越来越多，工作量也越来越大了。它既要为生产服务，大力支援农业生产和技术改造，又要为农村人民消费服务，全面组织和安排好广大社员的生活；既要帮助公社搞好收入和分配，又要搞好国家的农副产品收购和其它财贸工作。全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的方针，要求财贸部门更加自觉、全面、普遍和持久地给农业以有力的支援。这就是农村财贸工作面临的新形势。
    财贸部门怎样才能适应这一新的形势，更好地完成各项财贸任务呢？码头公社财贸部门派干部常驻生产队，就为我们提供了一个好的方法。类似的做法，在其它地区也有。生产队，是人民公社的基本核算单位，农村的生产、生活和许多工作都要通过生产队进行。生产队既是人民公社生产的基本单位，又是安排社员生活的基层单位。要做好农村财贸工作，把生产队作为农村财贸活动的基本阵地显然是十分必要的。财贸部门派干部驻到生产队，过去在许多地区也实行过，但那时主要是为了开展一定的工作或解决一定的问题而采取的临时性的措施。现在码头公社财贸部门进一步把干部派到生产队长期安家落户，并通过一定的组织形式把它固定下来，形成一种制度，这就使财贸工作在农村生产和群众生活中扎下了巩固的根基；同时，也使财贸部门的组织形式进一步适应了人民公社的组织形式，便于更好地发挥财贸部门的作用。
    财贸部门的职能是组织流通和分配。通过流通和分配活动来为生产服务和消费服务，这是财贸部门的基本任务。而为生产服务，大力支援生产，又是做好财贸工作的必不可少的条件。因此，衡量财贸工作好坏的标准，首先要看财贸人员是不是把支援生产放在首要地位上，要看财贸工作的活动是否有利于促进生产的发展。码头公社财贸部门推行财贸干部驻队制度以后出现了什么情况呢？表现得最突出的就是财贸工作和农业生产、和党的中心工作结合得更加紧密了。干部驻队以后，不仅帮助生产队大搞工具改革、挖掘劳动潜力，帮助生产队总结和推广先进经验，帮助发展养猪事业，帮助安排好社员生活，而且还直接参加了田间劳动。也就是说，他们既是财贸部门的派出人员，又是帮助生产队推进生产工作的干部，又是同群众一起劳动的普通社员，农村中一切有利于促进和发展生产、有利于增产粮食的事情，财贸干部都积极参加。
    也许有人认为，财贸部门是搞流通和分配的，在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食的高潮中，财贸部门的业务工作本来已经很繁重了，而财贸人员又要以主要的精力去支援农业生产，这不是会增加财贸人员的负担，影响财贸任务的完成吗？财贸干部驻队以后究竟应该怎样去开展财贸工作呢？支援农业对于完成财贸任务有没有矛盾呢？从表面上看是有矛盾的，但实际上不仅没有矛盾，而且更有利于财贸工作的开展。毛泽东同志早在1943年就说过：“县区党政工作人员在财政经济问题上，应以百分之九十的精力帮助农民增加生产，然后以百分之十的精力从农民取得税收，对前者用了苦功，对后者便轻而易举。”事实正是这样。武清县码头人民公社财贸部门实行了干部长期驻队制度以后，四个月当中为生产队做了一万五千多个劳动日。在劳动过程中，驻队的财贸干部及时掌握了群众的生产和生活的变化，很好地解决了群众的需要以及财贸工作和党的中心工作相结合的问题。例如，在夏菜播种准备期间，驻队干部在劳动中了解到有的社员存有菜籽，但有的生产队却因菜籽不足，完不成播种任务，经过他们及时组织收购，先后为缺菜籽的生产队调剂了七千多斤，结果使全社多种了七千多亩蔬菜。又如，他们了解到社员普遍要求商业部门定期收购各种农副产品，驻队干部就在公社党委的支持下，在全社开展了“爱国交售日”，每十天左右，由社员把交售的肥猪、鲜蛋等产品集中起来，交售给财贸部门。由于他们把主要的精力放在支援农业生产上，并且从深入生产深入群众的过程中，掌握了购销工作的情况和规律，结果，他们在发展生产的基础上超额完成了上半年的购销计划，出色地完成了各项财贸任务。可见，支援生产和完成财贸任务不仅没有矛盾，而且成为做好财贸工作一个很有利的条件了。
    财贸干部把主要精力用于支援农业生产和安排社员生活，这决不意味着可以放松甚至丢开财贸业务，财贸干部参加田间劳动的意义也决不限于为农业生产增加一个劳动力。更重要的是要通过参加劳动、参与生产规划和管理、参与社员生活安排，来了解和掌握生产和生活变化的需要。对这种变化和需要了解得越细致、越完整，反映的问题越正确、越及时，财贸工作也就越能及时地、更好地满足生产和生活各方面的需要。码头人民公社推行财贸干部驻队制度的成效，在这一点上也是表现得很突出的。
    财贸干部常驻生产队以后，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，可以养成处处关心生产、关心群众生活的优良作风，思想就会更加开阔，眼光就会更加远大；这就有利于进一步加强政策观点、生产观点和群众观点，把自己的工作和整个社会主义建设事业更加紧密地结合起来。由于财贸工作在生产和群众生活中扎下了根，群众也更加关心财贸工作了。这就使财贸工作的群众路线在新的形势下又有了进一步的发展。
    总起来说，推行财贸干部驻队制度，不仅是财贸工作组织制度和工作方法上的一项重大改革，同时也是改进干部作风、提高财贸干部思想水平的一个重要步骤，是财贸工作进一步贯彻执行党的群众路线的有效措施之一。推行财贸干部驻队制度，决不是农村财贸部门驻队干部少数人的事情。农村财贸部门全体职工和上级财贸部门都应当围绕这一改革，改进自己的工作，以不断巩固和发展干部驻队制度，不断发展和提高农村财贸工作。
