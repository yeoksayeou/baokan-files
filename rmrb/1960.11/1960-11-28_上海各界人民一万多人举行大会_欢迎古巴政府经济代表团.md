Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 27th. More than 10,000 people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a grand rally this afternoon at the Cultural Square to warmly welcome the representatives of the heroic Cuban people – Cuban National Bank President Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara and the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation he led.

    The atmosphere of the meeting was very warm. Representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai and militia teams sat at the front of the venue. At 3:35 PM, Shanghai Deputy Mayor Liu Shuzhou and others accompanied Major Guevara and other distinguished guests of the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation to the rostrum. At this moment, the band played the "July 26th" Cuban revolutionary march, and the entire audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically for a long time. A group of Young Pioneers presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

    Seated on the rostrum were Shanghai Deputy Mayors Song Richang, Jin Zhonghua, Zhao Zukang, Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPPCC Vice Chairmen Chen Wangdao, Hu Juewen, Liu Jingji, Chinese People's Liberation Army leaders stationed in Shanghai Lieutenant General Rao Shoukun, Major General Liao Zhengguo, Senior Colonel Zhou Jianping, China-Latin America Friendship Association Shanghai Council members Zhang Chunqiao, Xie Bangzhi, as well as heads of various departments in Shanghai.

    Also seated on the rostrum were Chinese Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Li Qiang, and Chinese Ambassador to Cuba Shen Jian.

    Cuban Ambassador to China Oscar Pino Santos and Cuban Workers' Union Deputy Secretary and Havana Province Textile Workers' Union General Secretary Acto Curbelo, who are currently visiting Shanghai, also ascended the rostrum.

    Liu Shuzhou delivered a speech at the welcoming rally. He expressed the warmest welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of the people of all walks of life in Shanghai, and paid the highest respect to the Cuban people who resolutely opposed US imperialist aggression and defended national independence.

    Liu Shuzhou enthusiastically praised the heroic Cuban people for the brilliant victories and great achievements they have achieved under the leadership of the revolutionary government headed by Prime Minister Fidel Castro in the struggle against US imperialism and in defending the Cuban revolution.

    Liu Shuzhou concluded by saying that in the struggle against our common enemy, we must stand shoulder to shoulder on the same front, supporting and encouraging each other. Every struggle of the Cuban people against US imperialism is a strong support for the Chinese people. The Chinese people will resolutely support every struggle of the Cuban people against US imperialism.

    Major Guevara began to speak amidst thunderous applause from the audience. He said that when we first arrived in China, we knew very little about the specific situation in China, only that China had fought for twenty-two years and had been liberated under the leadership of Mao Zedong, one of the greatest leaders in the contemporary world. But now I think we have a deep understanding of China, and we understand the essence of China's most valuable asset, which is the Chinese people. We not only know the Chinese leaders, but also know the Chinese people. We can see a people moving forward through the eyes of people shining with happiness. Six hundred and fifty million people are marching towards the future holding high the three red banners of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.

    He said that we Cuban people can best understand the Chinese people because we have all been subjected to blockades, plunder, insults and aggression by US imperialism. We have long been linked together like brothers by the deep hatred of imperialism towards our two peoples, and by the great desire to strive for complete liberation and peace. Our two countries' soldiers all hope to forever discard the epaulettes of soldiers who do not contribute to world peace, and instead pick up hammers, hoes, microscopes, slide rules, or writing brushes to contribute a little bit of strength to the happiness of the world. This also connects us together. But we also know that only by removing the obstacles of the shadow of imperialism can we see all these final prospects, otherwise it is just a dream.

    Speaking about the prospects of the Cuban revolutionary struggle, Major Guevara said with confidence that our basic slogans now are three sentences: study, work, take up guns. Study, in order to improve our technical, cultural, and scientific and technological self-sufficiency. Work, so that our ideals can be realized as soon as possible. Take up guns, to defend our ideals and the cause of justice.

    In his speech, Major Guevara also analyzed the situation of the anti-imperialist struggle in various parts of the world. He pointed out that the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger. From east to west, the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America have formed a common front of anti-imperialist struggle. China and Cuba stand on the same front, fighting against imperialist aggression.

    Major Guevara finally shouted together with everyone: "Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people!" "Long live the friendship between socialist countries and the people fighting for liberation!" "Long live world peace!"

    In between Liu Shuzhou's speech and Guevara's speech, the audience repeatedly erupted in thunderous applause and slogans: "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people!" "Cuba yes, Yankees no!"

    At the end of the meeting, a flag was presented to Major Guevara. At this moment, the band played the song "The Hearts of the People of the World Are United," and the enthusiasm of the masses reached its climax once again. Everyone sang and clapped along with the music until the distinguished guests left the venue.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 27th. Cuban National Bank President Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara and the Cuban Revolutionary Government Economic Delegation he led, accompanied by Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Li Qiang and Chinese Ambassador to Cuba Shen Jian, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Wuhan at noon today.

    上海各界人民一万多人举行大会
    欢迎古巴政府经济代表团
    据新华社上海27日电　上海市各界人民一万多人今天下午在文化广场举行盛大集会，隆重欢迎英雄的古巴人民的代表——古巴国家银行行长埃·切·格瓦拉少校和他率领的古巴革命政府经济代表团。
    大会的气氛非常热烈。中国人民解放军驻上海部队的代表和民兵的队伍坐在会场的最前面。三时三十五分，上海市副市长刘述周等陪同格瓦拉少校和古巴革命政府经济代表团其他贵宾们登上主席台，这时，乐队奏起“7月26日”古巴革命进行曲，全场起立，长时间地热烈鼓掌。一群少先队员向贵宾们献了鲜花。
    在主席台上就座的，有上海市副市长宋日昌、金仲华、赵祖康，政协上海市委员会副主席陈望道、胡厥文、刘靖基，中国人民解放军驻上海部队首长饶守坤中将、廖政国少将、周建平大校，中国拉丁美洲友好协会在上海理事张春桥、谢邦治，以及上海市各方面的负责人。
    在主席台上就座的，还有我国外交部副部长章汉夫，对外贸易部副部长李强，我国驻古巴大使申健。
    正在上海访问的古巴驻中国大使奥斯卡·皮诺·桑托斯和古巴工联组织副书记兼哈瓦那省纺织工会总书记阿克托·科尔巴内利也登上了主席台。
    刘述周在欢迎大会上致词。他代表上海市各界人民向贵宾们表示最热烈的欢迎，并向坚决反对美帝国主义侵略、维护民族独立的古巴人民致崇高的敬意。
    刘述周热情地赞扬了英雄的古巴人民在以菲德尔·卡斯特罗总理为首的革命政府的领导下，在反对美帝国主义和保卫古巴革命事业的斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利和巨大成就。
    刘述周最后说，在反对共同敌人的斗争中，我们必须肩并肩地站在一条战线上，相互支援，相互鼓舞。古巴人民对美帝国主义的每一个斗争，也就是对中国人民的有力支持。中国人民一定坚决支持古巴人民反对美帝国主义的每一个斗争。
    格瓦拉少校在全场群众暴风雨般的掌声中开始讲话。他说，刚到中国的时候，我们对中国的具体情况知道得很少，只知道中国曾经斗争了二十二年，并且在当代世界上最伟大的领袖之一毛泽东的领导下，获得了解放。但是现在我认为我们已经深刻地了解了中国，了解了中国革命最宝贵的财产的精华，就是中国人民。我们不仅认识了中国的领导人，而且认识了中国人民。我们能够通过人们的眼睛里闪烁着幸福的光芒，看到一个正在前进的人民。六亿五千万人举着总路线、大跃进和人民公社的三面红旗向着未来迈进。
    他说，我们古巴人民最能了解中国人民，因为我们都曾经遭到美帝国主义的封锁、掠夺、谩骂和侵略。我们早就被帝国主义对我们两国人民的深仇大恨、被争取彻底解放和争取和平的伟大愿望，像兄弟般地联结在一起了。我们两国的军人们，都希望永远丢掉那些无助于世界和平的军人的肩章，而拿起锤子、锄头、显微镜、计算尺或毛笔来为世界的幸福贡献一点微弱的力量，这同样也把我们连接在一起了。但是，我们也知道，只有排除帝国主义阴影的障碍，才能看到这一切最后的前景，否则它只不过是一个梦想。
    在讲到古巴革命斗争的前景的时候，格瓦拉少数充满信心地说，现在我们的基本口号是三句话：学习，劳动，拿起枪。学习，为了提高我们的技术、文化以及科学和技术方面自给自足的能力。劳动，为了我们的理想早日实现。拿起枪，为了保卫我们的理想和正义的事业。
    格瓦拉少校在讲话中，还分析了世界上各个方面反帝国主义斗争的形势。他指出，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量日益强大。从东方到西方，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的人民已结成了一条反帝国主义斗争的共同战线，中国和古巴站在这同一条战线上，为反对帝国主义的侵略进行斗争。
    格瓦拉少校最后和大家一起高呼：“中国和古巴人民之间永恒的友谊万岁！”“社会主义各国和为解放而斗争的人民之间的友谊万岁！”“世界和平万岁！”
    刘述周讲话和格瓦拉讲话中间，全场一次又一次地响起暴风雨般的掌声和口号声：“中国人民和古巴人民的友谊万岁！”“古巴西，洋基诺！”
    大会最后向格瓦拉少校献旗。这时，乐队奏起“全世界人民心一条”的歌曲，群众情绪再一次达到了最高潮，大家和着乐曲一边唱一边鼓掌，直到贵宾们离开会场。
    据新华社上海27日电　古巴国家银行行长埃·切·格瓦拉少校和他率领的古巴革命政府经济代表团，由对外贸易部副部长李强和我国驻古巴大使申健陪同，今天中午从武汉乘飞机到达上海。贵宾们在机场上受到了上海市副市长刘述周等负责人和各界群众的热烈欢迎。正在上海的外交部副部长章汉夫、礼宾司副司长葛步海、美澳司副司长林平也到机场欢迎。
