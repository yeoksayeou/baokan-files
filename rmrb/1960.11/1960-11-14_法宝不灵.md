The bloodstains of Inejiro Asanuma are not yet dry, and Moumié has tragically fallen victim to poison.

Imperialists and all reactionaries always view people and events according to their own logic. They always believe that as long as it's a person, they can be bought with money or intimidated with a knife; and that popular movements can be suppressed with these two magic weapons. For those who can't be bought with money, they use the knife. You want to oppose me? I'll kill you! You want to fight for independence? I'll poison you!

However, their wishful thinking is wrong. Looking back at history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, how many tyrants, despots, and traitors have indulged in cruelty and killed people like flies; how many revolutionary martyrs have fallen in pools of blood, yet history does not develop according to the wishes of the reactionaries. In the end, it is always the butchers themselves who fall. The people's struggle, no matter how much hardship and difficulty it encounters, even if it fails time and time again, will always advance step by step in the struggle until final victory.

Didn't U.S. imperialism once imagine that the victorious Chinese people would yield to them when they encountered difficulties? However, Comrade Mao Zedong's words represent the indomitable spirit of the Chinese people: "What is there to fear from a little difficulty? Let them blockade us! By blockade, blockade for eight or ten years, all of China's problems will be solved. The Chinese are not afraid of death, so why should they fear difficulties?" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Volume IV, page 1500). This is a truth. If you are not afraid of death and not afraid of difficulties, you dare to struggle and dare to despise enemies a hundred times stronger than yourself. With this, no threat or inducement will work, and no sweet talk will be effective. When those in front fall, those behind wipe away their tears and continue forward with more determined steps. The Japanese Socialist Party has declared that it will continue the struggle to abolish the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and the Central Committee of the Cameroon People's Union has stated that it will never retreat, "but resolutely and fearlessly continue the struggle so that one day we can shout at Moumié's grave: The revolution has triumphed!" U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries, listen, in the face of heroic people, your butcher knives are softer than tofu!

Imperialism holds a knife in its right hand and money in its left. These two magic weapons can only buy cowardly weaklings, can only scare those who kneel down to "rebel," but can never deal with revolutionary people who dare to struggle.

    法宝不灵
    苗隼
    浅沼稻次郎的血迹未干，穆米埃又惨遭毒手。
    帝国主义者和一切反动派总是按自己的逻辑看人看事。他们总认为：凡是人，只要用钱就可以收买，只要用刀就可吓住；人民的运动，也只要用这两件法宝，就可以压服住。对于用钱不灵的人，他们就用刀。你要反对我吗？我杀掉你！你想争取独立吗？我毒死你！
    然而，他们的如意算盘打错了。翻开古今中外的历史，多少个暴君、独夫民贼，残民以逞，杀人如麻；多少个人民英烈在血泊里倒下去，历史却并不按照反动派的愿望发展，最后倒下去的，总是那些屠夫们自己。人民的斗争，不管遭到多少艰难困苦，甚至一次次失败，但总是要在斗争里步步前进，直到最后胜利。
    美帝国主义不是曾经幻想胜利了的中国人民遇到困难的时候会向它们屈服吗？然而，毛泽东同志的话代表了中国人民的磅礴的气概：“多少一点困难怕什么。封锁吧，封锁十年八年，中国的一切问题都解决了。中国人死都不怕，还怕困难么？”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷一五○○页）这是一条真理。不怕死，不怕困难，就敢于斗争，敢于蔑视百倍强大于自己的敌人。有这一条，什么威胁利诱都不在话下，什么花言巧语都失去灵验。前面的人倒下了，后面的人擦干眼泪，迈开更坚强的步子继续向前。日本社会党声明继续进行废除日美安全条约的斗争，喀麦隆人民联盟中央委员会表示决不后退，“坚决而无畏地继续进行斗争，以便有朝一日我们能在穆米埃的墓前高呼：革命胜利了！”美帝国主义和一切反动派听着，在英雄的人民面前，你们的屠刀比豆腐还软！
    帝国主义右手拿着刀，左手拿着钱。这两件法宝，只能收买胆小怕死的懦夫，只能吓唬跪着“造反”的假革命者，却永远也对付不了敢于斗争的革命的人民。
