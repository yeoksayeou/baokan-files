They issued a protest letter on the 10th, demanding a 150% increase in wages, and declared that if the puppet authorities did not respond to the workers' demands by December 7th, then they would "carry out a strong struggle with force."

    It is reported that these dockworkers are all employed by enterprises affiliated with the puppet government. They work twelve to eighteen hours a day, but the wages they earn can only cover one-third of the minimum living expenses.

    要求提高工资  维护生活权利
    南朝鲜十万码头工人坚持斗争
    新华社平壤16日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜各地十万名码头工人已联合起来为提高工资展开了顽强的斗争。
    据汉城基督教电台报道，这些码头工人已经坚持斗争一个月。他们在10日发表了抗议书，要求提高工资一倍半，并声明，如果到12月7日傀儡当局还不答复工人们的要求的话，那末他们将“以实力进行强烈的斗争”。
    据报道，这些码头工人都是傀儡政府附属企业所雇用的，他们每天工作十二小时到十八小时，而所得的工资却只能支付最低生活费用的三分之一。
