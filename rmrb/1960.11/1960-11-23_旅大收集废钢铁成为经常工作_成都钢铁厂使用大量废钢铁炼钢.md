    Lüda Collects Scrap Steel as a Regular Task
    Chengdu Steel Plant Uses Large Amounts of Scrap Steel for Steelmaking
    (Our Dispatch) The movement to collect scrap steel in Lüda City has begun to become regularized. As of the beginning of November, the city has excavated more than 30,780 tons of scrap steel, of which more than 20,460 tons have been put into production.
    In order to transform the campaign-style excavation of scrap steel into a regular mass movement, Lüda City implemented a daily reporting system for the excavation, transportation, and use of scrap steel, inspecting and promoting it daily, and promptly resolving practical problems. Many units have also taken measures to combine the campaign-style excavation movement with regular collection work. The Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant divided the entire plant into several areas, assigning responsibility for collection by workshop and department, with specific personnel in charge. In addition, each workshop and department in this plant assigned a director or section chief to be responsible for this work, formulating methods for the recycling and management of scrap steel, implementing them among the workers, reporting daily, centralizing every ten days, and summarizing and evaluating monthly, to ensure the regularization of scrap steel collection.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu) Workers at the Chengdu Steel Plant actively tap the potential of raw materials and advocate for thrifty steelmaking. In October alone, the recycled scrap steel used for production was equivalent to 60% of the pig iron brought in from outside the plant, ensuring the needs of continued production leaps.
    As early as September, the plant's Party committee, in accordance with the spirit of emphasizing both increased production and conservation, mobilized workers to summarize past conservation experiences, focusing on saving raw materials, materials, and fuel as much as they focused on production. The Party committee secretary and the plant director led cadres to the site to explain the important significance of emphasizing both increased production and conservation to the workers, helping to formulate conservation plans; the plant also established a special organization headed by the Party committee secretary to strengthen organizational leadership. Each workshop, team, and individual set specific conservation targets, incorporated them into competition conditions, and conducted daily inspections and evaluations. In their work, the factory leaders organized some workers to pick up scrap steel and iron and to undertake transportation, crushing, and other work; on the other hand, they transferred some workers to form a professional team responsible for recycling and processing various scrap metals. In order to ensure that scrap steel could be put into production in a timely manner, they closely combined machine crushing and transportation with manual crushing and transportation, ensuring that crushing and transportation work kept up with the needs of production.

    旅大收集废钢铁成为经常工作
    成都钢铁厂使用大量废钢铁炼钢
    本报讯　旅大市收集废钢铁的运动开始走向经常化，截至11月上旬，全市已挖掘废钢铁三万零七百八十余吨，其中有二万零四百六十余吨已投入生产。
    为了使突击性的挖掘废钢铁运动发展成为经常性的群众运动，旅大市实行了废钢铁挖掘、运输、使用日报制度，按日检查和促进，及时解决实际问题。许多单位也都采取措施，把突击性的挖掘运动和经常性的收集工作结合起来。大连机车车辆厂把全厂划分若干区域，按车间、科室分片包干，专责进行收集工作。此外，这个厂各车间和科室还责成一名主任或科长负责此项工作，制定废钢铁回收、管理办法，在职工群众中贯彻执行，按日上报，按旬集中，按月总结评比，保证了收集废钢铁工作经常化。
    据新华社成都电　成都钢铁厂职工积极挖掘原料潜力，提倡勤俭炼钢，10月份仅用于生产的回收废钢铁，就相当于外调进厂生铁数量的60％，保证了生产持续跃进的需要。
    早在9月份，这个厂的党委就根据增产与节约并重的精神，发动职工总结了过去节约的经验，像抓生产一样地大抓原料、材料和燃料的节约。党委书记和厂长都带领干部，到现场向职工群众讲解了增产、节约并重的重要意义，帮助制订了节约计划；厂部还成立了以党委书记为首的专门机构，加强组织领导。各车间、小组和个人都订出了具体的节约指标，纳入竞赛条件，天天检查评比。在工作中，工厂领导上一方面组织一部分职工，拣废钢废铁和担任运输、破碎等工作；一方面抽调部分职工组成专业队伍，负责回收和处理各种废金属。为了使废钢铁能及时投入生产，他们把机具破碎、运输和手工破碎、运输紧密结合起来，使破碎、运输工作跟上了生产的需要。
