Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 22nd. The workers of Luoyang Bearing Factory carried out equipment maintenance work, creating conditions for continuous leap forward in production. From mid-August to the end of October, the factory has inspected and repaired more than 6,300 pieces of equipment of various types.

In order to maintain the equipment well, the factory closely combined workshop leading cadres, maintenance workers, and production workers to conduct a technical inspection and appraisal of 96% of the factory's main production equipment. The problems found were classified and prioritized, and maintenance workers, adjustment workers, and operators were organized to carry out combined shock repairs. The workers of the filing group of the steel ball workshop, which won the title of National Advanced Collective, organized three equipment maintenance professional shock teams, inspecting and repairing at the same time. Within two days, they repaired seven ball grinding equipment and put them all into production. At the same time, the workers generally formulated equipment maintenance plans and strengthened the daily maintenance of the equipment. Some workshops have also established and improved equipment maintenance management systems such as lubrication, shift handover, cleaning, and safe operation. The workers of the steel ball workshop have summed up a set of equipment maintenance experience, and the entire workshop has basically achieved no downtime, no "four leaks" (oil leaks, water leaks, air leaks, electricity leaks), and no equipment working with defects.

The workers of this factory also accelerated the production of equipment parts and carried out technical revolution in maintenance. The workers of the electromechanical branch factory and the machine repair stations of various basic production workshops have produced sufficient spare parts in more than a month. In September, the workers of the machine repair station of the small batch workshop manufactured four types of 27 sets of commonly used spare parts for machine tools and created a "rapid maintenance method," which greatly reduced the downtime during maintenance. The workers of the electromechanical repair system, together with the production workers, have broken through 36 technical key points such as the repair of machine tool magnetic chucks in more than a month, solving many long-standing problems.

    鞍钢第三炼钢厂“查隐患、灭隐患”，保证快速炼钢  洛阳轴承厂对主要设备进行技术检查，健全维修制度
    新华社郑州22日电　洛阳轴承厂职工开展设备维修工作，为生产持续跃进创造条件。从8月中旬到10月底，全厂共已检查修复各种设备六千三百多台次。
    为了维修好设备，这个工厂由车间领导干部、维修工人和生产工人密切结合，对全厂96％的主要生产设备进行了一次技术检查和鉴定，对查出的问题分类排队，组织维修工、调整工、操作工三结合突击修理。荣获全国先进集体的钢珠车间锉削小组的工人，组织了三个设备维护专业突击队，边检查边修理，两天内就修复了七台磨珠设备，全部投入生产。同时，职工们普遍制订了设备维护计划，加强对设备的日常维护保养工作。有的车间还建立和健全了润滑、交接班、清扫、安全操作等设备维护管理制度。钢球车间工人总结出一套设备维修经验，全车间已基本上做到无停台、无“四漏”（漏油、漏水、漏气、漏电）、无带病工作的设备。
    这个厂的职工还加速了设备配件生产，开展维修技术革命。机电分厂和各基本生产车间机修站的职工，一个多月来已生产出充足的备件。小批车间机修站的工人在9月份制造了四种二十七套机床常用的备件，并创造了“快速维修法”，大大减少了维修中的停台时间。机电修理系统职工和生产工人一道，一个多月突破机床磁力吸盘修理等技术关键三十六个，解决了不少长期没有解决的问题。
