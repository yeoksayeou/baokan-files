    Poems from a Visit to the Soviet Union
    Li Ji
    Old Man Jin Pingshan
    While visiting Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, in the Soviet Union, we attended a family wedding. As soon as we entered the wedding feast hall, we heard a Soviet old man shout in Chinese, "The Chinese have arrived, welcome! Welcome!" He kept clapping his hands. This old man was Ledogorov, whose Chinese name is Jin Pingshan.
  Old man Jin Pingshan,
  Is sixty-three this year.
  Tall and strong with a loud voice,
  His heroic spirit like the old days.
  When the old man was young,
  He volunteered to come to China.
  He joined the Northern Expedition and fought battles,
  Wounded three times, he didn't leave the front line.
  Scars remain on his body, blood was shed on the Yangtze River.
  The friendship forged in battle is the strongest,
  How can he forget his second hometown?
  He looks to the East, his heart filled with joy.
  The heroic people have won victory,
  Holding high the red flag to build a paradise.
  Old man Jin Pingshan, his enthusiasm like fire.
  Seeing the Chinese is like seeing family,
  He repeatedly raises his glass to celebrate the meeting.
  We wish the old hero, a life as long as the Southern Mountain pine;
  May the friendship evergreen never age,
  As high as the mountains and as long as the flowing water.
    Ode to the New City (Gift to the new city of
  Songai near Baku)
    Ten years ago, I visited the Caspian coast,
    Ten years later, I'm back in Baku.
    The Caspian Sea still splashes waves,
    But new city has been built in the Baku countryside.
    The barren land by the sea in the past,
    Is now filled with chimneys, one after another.
    Factories connected as far as the eye can see,
    The whistles sing to each other.
    Clumps of green trees sprout new buds,
    Wildflowers bloom red along the roadside.
    Teams of Young Pioneers with apple cheeks,
    Were all born in the same year as the new city.
    A new city risen from the ground over ten miles,
    Little Baku is famous far and wide,
    The heroic people have achieved much,
    Another pearl of the Caspian Sea.
    Night Rain Song (Dedicated to a car
  driver comrade at the Lenin Central
  Stadium in Moscow)
    September autumn rainy night,
    The pattering sound never stops.
    Heavy rain, slippery roads, I can't go home.
    Few pedestrians, hard to find a taxi.
    Running in the rain through the streets,
    In the distance, I see a car in the square.
    Just as I'm about to wave,
    The car door opens to welcome me.
    After shaking hands and talking,
    I realize it's not a taxi.
    "Voluntarily offering a ride,
    Chinese comrade, please get in!"
    No money needed, no thanks needed;
    "Why would I take money for driving a Chinese comrade,
  We are all brothers, no need to thank me!"
    Back at the hotel, unable to sleep, I write this poem.
    Outside the window, the pattering sound doesn't stop,
    Friendship warms my heart, still feeling the heat.

    访苏诗抄
    李季老人金平山
    我们在苏联乌兹别克共和国首都塔什干访问时，曾去参加了一个家庭的婚礼。当我们一走进婚礼喜宴大门时，就听见一位苏联老人用中国话高声喊道：“中国人来了，欢迎！欢迎！”并且连连鼓掌不止。这位老人就是列多戈洛夫，他的中国名字叫金平山。
  老人金平山，
  今年六十三。
  身材魁伟嗓音亮，
  英雄气概赛当年。
  老人年轻时，
  志愿来中国。
  参加北伐打过仗，
  负伤三次不下火线。伤痕留身上，鲜血洒长江。战斗的友谊最牢固，第二故乡怎能忘？举目望东方，心情多欢畅。英雄的人民胜利了，高举红旗建天堂。老人金平山，热情火一般。见了中国人像亲人，连连举杯庆相见。敬祝老英雄，寿比南山松；友谊青松永不老，山高水长流不断。新城赞（赠巴库附近的新城
  松尕依）十年前曾访里海滨，十年后又来巴库城。里海依旧溅飞浪，巴库郊野建新城。当年海滨荒野地，而今烟囱连烟囱。厂房相连望不尽，汽笛歌声相对鸣。丛丛绿树吐新芽，道旁鲜花争相红。队队红领巾苹果脸，都与新城同年生。十里新城平地起，小巴库万里扬名声，英雄人民功绩多，里海明珠又一颗。雨夜吟（寄赠莫斯科列宁中央
  运动场的一位汽车
  司机同志）九月秋雨夜，淅沥连绵声不歇。雨大路滑归不得。行人稀少难租车。冒雨满街跑，远望广场有汽车。正要上前招手问，敞开车门相迎接。握手谈过话，才知不是出租车。“自愿义务来相送，中国同志请上车！“钱也不要钱，谢也不要谢；送送中国同志还要什
  么钱，都是兄弟哪要谢！”下车回旅馆，难以安睡把诗写。窗外淅沥声不止，友情暖心心犹热。
