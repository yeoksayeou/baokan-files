Promote Advanced Experiences, Carry Out Emulation Drives
Zhenqin Commune's Animal Husbandry Develops at High Speed

    This newspaper reports that leading cadres of Zhenqin Commune in Chengduo County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, went deep into production teams and herds, launched a mass movement for high yields and abundant production, and achieved high-speed development in animal husbandry. Due to the implementation of the policy of "taking sturdiness as the key link," the lamb survival rate this year reached 97.7%, the calf survival rate reached 99.5%, and the foal survival rate reached 100%. At present, the number of livestock of all kinds has developed to more than 47,000 head, an increase of more than 34% over last year, becoming a model in animal husbandry production in the whole state.
    Zhenqin Commune is located on the southern slope of the Bayan Har Mountains at an altitude of more than 4,300 meters. It is a commune mainly engaged in animal husbandry, with a total of 927 households and 3,868 people, all of whom are Tibetan. In order to realize the high-speed development of animal husbandry, as early as February this year, before the lambing season, the commune Party committee and leaders at all levels went deep into the grassroots, combined with the study of the advanced experience of the Zhihe Brigade of Guomaying Commune in Guinan County, Qinghai Province—a provincial model for animal husbandry production—which achieves two births a year and multiple births per litter, and organized herders throughout the commune to launch discussions. Through many large and small meetings, and by emphasizing favorable conditions, the vast number of commune members realized that although the climate on the plateau is changeable and the natural conditions are not very good, there are favorable conditions such as the superiority of the commune system and abundant pasture. As long as the Party's leadership is strengthened, it is entirely possible to develop animal husbandry at a high speed like the Zhihe Brigade. On the basis of enhancing confidence and raising awareness, a competition upsurge of learning from Zhihe, catching up with Zhihe, and surpassing Zhihe was launched. Teams and individuals all put forward targets and formulated measures. After full discussion among the masses, the commune Party committee formulated a plan to maintain good condition year-round, rationally use grasslands, extend grazing time, graze in separate groups, strengthen the feeding management of breeding stock and young stock, actively promote artificial insemination, estrus induction, and hot breeding, prevent and control diseases, and gradually establish a livestock file system and other twelve measures to increase animal husbandry production.
    In order to ensure that every measure to increase production is fulfilled, the commune Party committee, based on the characteristics of the mobile grazing of livestock, went deep into production teams and herds to launch mass movements and carry out red flag evaluation competitions between teams and between herds. Ren Guangxue, the secretary of the commune Party committee, personally followed the herds for grazing, providing roving guidance, discovering problems, solving problems, and promoting advanced grazing experience in a timely manner. Leaders of the major brigades and production teams conducted regular inspections and evaluations in the herds. Production teams conducted evaluations every three to five days, and each herd conducted evaluations and inspections before grazing in the morning or in the evening to exchange experiences. The 11th Production Team of the Third Brigade originally thought that the condition of the livestock was well maintained, but after evaluation and inspection, it was found that there were still third-class condition livestock. At this time, Wang Huaimei, acting secretary of the general Party branch of the brigade, immediately held discussions with the herders and adopted methods such as extending grazing time and promoting night grazing, and quickly eliminated the third-class condition. The launch of the red flag evaluation competition stimulated the enthusiasm of the herders. In grazing, they firmly grasped the key that the good condition of the ewes is the key to livestock breeding, actively promoted night grazing and extended grazing time, carefully fed the livestock, and ensured that they regained condition in spring, increased condition in summer, maintained full condition in autumn, and maintained condition in winter, remaining strong throughout the year. At present, 95% of all types of livestock in the commune are in first-class condition, 5% are in second-class condition, and third-class condition has been eliminated. Through the red flag evaluation competition, three advanced production teams, seven advanced production teams, and more than 130 "ten-good" commune members emerged in the whole commune this year. The commune also implemented the policy of "taking animal husbandry as the main focus, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations," rationally arranged labor, and sowed more than 40,000 mu of land, including more than 5,500 mu of grain crops. Not only did the two agricultural teams of the commune, with more than 700 people, achieve self-sufficiency in grain, but they also provided a large amount of fodder and feed for livestock.

    推广先进经验　开展竞赛运动
    珍秦公社畜牧业高速度发展
    本报讯　玉树藏族自治州称多县珍秦公社领导干部深入生产小队和畜群，开展群众性的高额丰产运动，畜牧业生产获得了高速度的发展。由于贯彻了以壮为纲的方针，今年羊羔成活率高达97.7％，牛犊成活率达99.5％，马驹成活率达100％。目前，各类牲畜已发展到四万七千多头，比去年增殖34％多，成为全州畜牧业生产上的标兵。
    珍秦公社位于巴颜喀拉山南麓的四千三百多米的高原上，是一个以牧为主的公社，共有九百二十七户，三千八百六十八人，社员均系藏族。为了实现畜牧业的高速度发展，早在今年2月接羔季节前，公社党委和各级领导干部就深入基层，结合学习青海省畜牧业生产标兵——贵南县过马营公社直核大队一年两生、一胎多羔的先进经验，在全社范围内组织放牧员展开讨论。通过多次大小型会议，大摆有利条件，使广大社员认清虽然高原气候多变，自然条件不很好，但有公社制度优越，牧草丰富等有利条件，只要加强党的领导，像直核大队一样高速度发展畜牧业是完全可以办到的。在增强信心、提高认识的基础上，掀起了学直核、赶直核、超直核的竞赛热潮，队队、人人提指标、订措施。经过群众的充分讨论，公社党委制订出常年抓膘的规划，合理使用草原，延长放牧时间，分群放牧，加强种畜、幼畜饲养管理，积极推广人工授精、催情和热胎配种，防治疫病，以及逐步建立牲畜档案制等十二项畜牧业增产措施。
    为了使增产措施条条兑现，公社党委根据畜群流动放牧的特点，深入生产小队和畜群大搞群众运动，开展队与队、群与群之间的红旗评比竞赛。公社党委书记任广学亲自跟群放牧，巡回指导，及时发现问题、解决问题和推广先进放牧经验。各大队、生产队领导干部在深入畜群中，开展定期检查评比，生产队三至五天评比一次，每个畜群之间利用早晨放牧前或晚上评比检查，交流经验。第三大队的第十一生产队原来认为畜膘抓得很好，但经过评比检查后发现还有三类膘。这时大队党总支代理书记汪怀美立即和放牧员一起座谈研究，采取延长放牧时间，推行夜牧等办法，很快消灭了三类膘。红旗评比竞赛的开展，激发了放牧员的积极性，在放牧中都紧紧抓住母畜膘肥体壮是牲畜增殖的关键，积极推行夜牧和延长放牧时间，精心饲养，做到了春季复膘，夏季增膘，秋季满膘，冬季保膘，一年四季常壮。目前，全社各类牲畜一类膘达95％，二类膘5％，消灭了三类膘。通过红旗评比竞赛，今年全公社共涌现出三个先进生产队、七个先进生产小队和一百三十多名十好社员。公社还贯彻执行以牧为主，农牧结合，发展多种经营的方针，合理安排劳力，播种四万多亩土地，其中粮食作物五千五百多亩，不仅公社的两个农业队七百多人实现了粮食自给，并为牲畜提供了大量饲草和饲料。
