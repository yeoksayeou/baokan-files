Starting from “Changing the Stove”
Chen Shi

    A small debate was held in the Fourth Canteen of Dongguotou Village. The three stoves in the canteen were originally suitable for burning coal and whole split firewood. After changing to burning softwood, a large amount of scrap firewood was "useless" because the stovepipes could only accommodate whole firewood. The "resident" squad leader discovered this problem. At this time, the commune Party committee called for vigorously promoting the new-style underground draft stoves. Therefore, he discussed with the cooks to start modifying the stoves immediately. However, three out of the five people said in unison: "We are too busy with work, how can we have time to do this? It's too much trouble!" Each side had its own reasons, and no one would give in. After both sides expressed their opinions, the squad leader took out a small notebook and put all the firewood "base," the daily burning amount of the three stoves, the amount of scrap firewood wasted, and the firewood-saving methods of the new stove based on foreign experience on the table. After adding it all up: If we continue to burn with the old stoves, the team's firewood will only be enough to burn until July next year. If we make a change, although it will take about two days, we can save tens of thousands of catties of firewood alone. In addition, the new stove has the advantages of being "simple, fast, and clean," which the old stove cannot compare with. In this way, after revealing the base and calculating, the three cooks who said it was "too much trouble" were speechless.
    All objective things contain contradictions. Where there are contradictions, there is "trouble." It depends on how you deal with it. The more you fear it, the more you cannot resolve the contradiction, and the more "trouble" there will be. Changing the stove will of course cause "trouble." However, this "trouble" is at most two days of work. If you think about it carefully, if you are afraid of two days of "trouble," it will result in dozens of two-day periods without firewood to cook, and the pot cannot be opened. As a result, you only care about the small "trouble" in front of you, and you will ignore the long-term big "trouble," planting the seeds of disaster. This becomes losing big for small. Conversely, it only takes two days of "trouble" to exchange for dozens of two-day periods of "convenience." As a result, solving the small "trouble" will avoid the big "trouble." This is doing more with less.
    There are many "ghosts" that are constantly scaring and hindering us, and there are many "caltrops" that want to prick our feet. This "trouble" can be considered one kind of "ghost" and "caltrop." They do exist, but they are also subject to people's will: if you fear them, they will become more crazy and bullying, even finding you incessantly. But if you are not afraid of them and fight them, they will also yield. In your hands, they will inevitably become "permanent" "losers," and you, not only will you not become a "prisoner," but you will become a "victorious general," constantly winning progress in your work.
    Mencius once said: "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a man, it always first frustrates his spirit and will, exhausts his muscles and bones, starves his body, leaves him destitute, and confounds his actions. Only in this way can he stir his heart, temper his nature, and increase his abilities." We proletarian revolutionaries shoulder the great task of realizing communism. Of course, this is not a great task "bestowed by Heaven," but a demand of the times and the class. To accomplish this great task, we will encounter all kinds of "troubles," and we must establish the idea of long-term hard struggle, constantly fight against "trouble," and solve "trouble" one by one. Chairman Mao taught us: Work is struggle. Those places have difficulties and problems that need us to solve. We work and struggle to solve difficulties. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, bravely overcome numerous difficulties, solve many "troubles," and finally realize our great ideal.

    从“改灶”说起
    陈实
    东裹头村第四食堂举行了一次小型辩论会。食堂的仨灶原来都是适合烧煤和整块劈柴的，改烧软柴以后，由于灶筒只能入整柴，使大量碎柴无“用武之地”。“驻堂”的小队长发现了这个问题，恰好这时公社党委又号召大力推广新式地抽灶，于是，他就跟炊事员们商量立即动手改灶。可是五个人里有三个却异口同声地说：“脚下活儿太忙，哪有工夫倒动这个，怪麻烦的！”公说公有理，婆说婆有理，谁也不服谁。小队长等双方都表示意见后，他掏出个小本，把全队的柴禾“底”、仨灶日烧数、碎柴浪费数，以及根据外地经验，新灶的省柴法等等，统统亮上桌面，一合计：照旧灶继续烧下去，队上的柴禾将够烧到明年7月，假如来个破旧更新，虽然约需耽悞两天事，可是仅柴禾一项，就能节省出几万斤，加上冬季发动社员打柴，全队可作到自足有余。至于新灶具备的“简、快、净”等优点，更是旧灶所不能比的。这样，亮底又合计，三个说“怪麻烦”的炊事员只好哑口无言。
    一切客观事物都是存在着矛盾的，有矛盾就有“麻烦”，就看你怎样去对付它。你越怕它，就越不能解决矛盾，也就会越“麻烦”。改灶，当然是会有“麻烦”的。但是，这个“麻烦”充其量也不过是两天的干头。如果细想一想，因为怕两天的“麻烦”，那就将会造成几十个两天灶下无柴，掀不开锅，结果，只顾到眼前的小“麻烦”，而会忽略了长远的大“麻烦”，种下祸根。这就成了因小失大，反之，只消“麻烦”两天，换来的却是几十个两天的“方便”，结果，解决了小“麻烦”，就会避免大“麻烦”。这就是事半功倍。
    有许多“鬼”，时时在吓唬、阻挠着我们，有许多“蒺藜”要扎我们的脚板。这“麻烦”就算是“鬼”和“蒺藜”的一种吧。它们是确确实实存在着的，但它们又是依人的意志为转移的：你怕它，它就越疯狂，越欺人，甚至形影不离地找到你头上来。但是，如果你不怕它，和它斗争，它也就屈服了。在你手下，它就势必成为“永久牌”的“败寇”，而你，不但未成“俘虏”，反倒当上“常胜将军”，不断赢得工作的进步。
    孟子曾说：“天将降大任于是人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤，空乏其身，行拂乱其所为，所以动心忍性，曾益其所不能。”我们无产阶级革命者，肩负着实现共产主义的大任，当然这不是“天降”的大任，而是时代和阶级的要求。我们要完成这个大任，就会碰到种种“麻烦”，就要确立起长期艰苦奋斗的思想，不断和“麻烦”作斗争，一个一个地去解决“麻烦”。毛主席教导我们：工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。我们一定要记住毛主席的教导，勇往直前地克服重重困难，解决许多“麻烦”，最后实现我们伟大的理想。
