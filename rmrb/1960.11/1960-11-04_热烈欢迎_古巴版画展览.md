    Warmly Welcome the "Cuban Print Exhibition"
    Li Qun
    The "Cuban Print Exhibition," carrying the profound friendship of the Cuban people, is being held for the first time in our capital after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Cuba and our country. This is a very meaningful event. We are very interested in appreciating these works of art. It will surely be warmly welcomed by the Chinese people.
    Since the Cuban people overthrew the dictatorial regime of the US imperialist puppet Batista and established a revolutionary government, our people have listened with immense respect to every piece of good news from across the ocean about the Cuban people. The Cuban people stand on the front lines against US imperialism, adhere to the revolutionary struggle with an awe-inspiring heroic spirit, and have won continuous victories, setting an example for the entire Latin America and all oppressed nations in the world, inspiring their national liberation and anti-aggression struggles, and further strengthening their confidence in victory. Today, we are extremely happy and feel very close to seeing the print art of the Cuban people for the first time in Zhongshan Park, Beijing.
    Print art in Cuba has a long history and high achievements. The exhibition features 118 works by 23 printmakers. Most are woodcuts and linocuts, as well as some copperplate prints. These works include pieces by famous older Cuban printmakers, as well as creations by young printmakers and art school students. Here, we not only see the artistic achievements of the predecessors, but also the artistic talents and good academic results beginning to emerge in the creations of the younger generation.
    The 118 prints reflect the many aspects of Cuban people's lives and have diverse styles. The woodcuts and linocuts by famous Cuban printmakers like A. Almendros, J. Rigol, and G. González have excellent artistic techniques, skillful knife work, and clever black and white handling. For example, A. Almendros' "Agitator," "Peasant," and "Road Builder," G. González's "Serenade," and "Painter's Studio," J. Rigol's "Portrait Head"... have all left a deep impression on us. In particular, A. Almendros' "Agitator" depicts the image of Fidel Castro, the leader of the Cuban people, precisely as he called on the peasants to carry out land reform. For this reason, the author specifically marked "Land is Life" in prominent letters on the screen. This painting has been widely welcomed by the audience. In addition, the female printmaker A. R. González's "Insurgent" and A. Posse's black "Face" have also attracted attention from the audience.
    In addition to the above-mentioned works, many of the exhibits reflect the miserable lives of the Cuban people before the revolution, under the tyrannical rule of Batista. Such as L. Fan-Dumois's "Displaced People," "Peasants Sacrificed Under Tyranny," A. Almendros' "The Forgotten Ones," J. Rigol's "The Poor," E. Di Castillo's "Hawking"... Although these works do not depict the new people's life, they also help us to understand the past of the standing up Cuban people. We Chinese people were also liberated from the dark rule of imperialism and reactionaries, and we have a common destiny with the Cuban people. Let us hate the dark past even more and better defend the revolutionary victory of today. In order to make the dark past never return, and in order to oppose the aggression of US imperialism, the Chinese and Cuban people need to support each other and unite closely in the struggle.
    Among the Cuban prints, there are also some that depict the Cuban people's opposition to imperialist wars of aggression and their love for lasting world peace. These prints reflect the common aspirations of the people of the world. However, the Cuban people know very well how to achieve peace. They have shown with their actions that they do not beg for peace from imperialism, but strive for peace with the heroic struggle and strength of the armed people.
    The exhibition of Cuban prints in Beijing is only the beginning of cultural exchanges between our country and Cuba. We earnestly look forward to more print works reflecting the new life of the heroic Cuban people who have stood up, and more works reflecting the people's struggle and the people's new spiritual outlook being exhibited in our country in the future. Chinese and Cuban print artists will learn from each other and enhance friendship through mutual observation of print works from both countries.
    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Cuban people!

    热烈欢迎“古巴版画展览”
    力群
    当古巴共和国和我国建立了邦交之后，带着古巴人民深厚友谊的“古巴版画展览”在我国首都首次举行，是一件很有意义的事。我们怀着很大的兴趣来欣赏这些艺术作品。它必将受到中国人民热烈的欢迎。
    自古巴人民推翻了美帝国主义傀儡巴蒂斯塔的独裁政权，成立了革命政府以来，我国人民一向怀着无比的敬意听取从大洋的彼岸传来的关于古巴人民的每一个好消息。古巴人民站在反对美帝国主义的最前线，以威武不屈的英雄气概坚持了革命斗争，赢得了接连不断的胜利，给整个拉丁美洲和全世界被压迫的民族树立了榜样，鼓舞了他们民族解放和反侵略斗争的斗志，更加坚定了他们的胜利信心。今天，我们在北京中山公园第一次看到了古巴人民的版画艺术，感到异常的亲切和高兴。
    版画艺术在古巴，具有悠久的历史，并有很高的成就。这次展出的共有二十三位版画家的一百一十八幅作品。多半是木刻画和麻胶版画，和一些铜版画。这些作品除了一部分是古巴著名的老版画家的作品外，大都是一些青年版画家和美术学校的学生的创作。我们在这里不仅看到了先辈的艺术成就，而且看到了青年一代在创作中开始显露的艺术才能和良好的学习成绩。
    一百一十八幅版画，反映了古巴人民的多方面的生活，具有多样的风格。古巴著名版画家安·阿尔门德罗斯，霍·里哥尔，加·贡萨雷斯的木刻和麻胶版画有良好的艺术技巧，刀法熟练，黑白处理巧妙。如安·阿尔门德罗斯的《鼓动者》、《农民》、《开路》，加·贡萨雷斯的《小夜曲》、《画家工作室》，霍·里哥尔的《人物头像》……都给我们留下了深刻印象。尤其是安·阿尔门德罗斯的《鼓动者》在画面上塑造了古巴人民的领袖菲德尔·卡斯特罗的像，正是他号召农民起来进行土地改革。为此，作者在画面上特别用显著的文字标出“土地就是生命”。这幅画受到了观众普遍的欢迎。此外如女版画家安·罗·贡萨雷斯的《起义者》和阿·波塞的黑人《面像》也很为观众所注意。
    除了以上提到的作品外，展品中还有不少是反映古巴革命前的人民，在巴蒂斯塔暴政统治下的悲惨生活的。如莱·凡——杜莫依斯的《流离失所的人》、《在暴政下牺牲的农民》，安·阿尔门德罗斯的《被遗忘的人们》，霍·里哥尔的《可怜的人》，埃·迪·卡斯蒂约的《叫卖》……这些作品虽然没有描绘新的人民生活，但也有助于我们了解站起来的古巴人民的过去。我们中国人民也是从帝国主义和反动派的黑暗统治下解放出来的，我们和古巴人民有着共同的命运，让我们更加憎恨黑暗的过去，更好地保卫今天的革命胜利果实吧。中国人民和古巴人民为了使黑暗的过去一去不复返，为了反对美帝国主义的侵略，就需要在斗争中互相支持，亲密团结。
    在古巴版画中，还有一些是表现古巴人民反对帝国主义的侵略战争，热爱世界持久和平的版画，这些版画反映了世界人民的共同愿望。然而古巴人民是深知如何取得和平的，他们用自己的行动说明了，他们不是向帝国主义乞求和平，而是用武装起来的人民的英勇斗争和力量争取和平。
    这次古巴版画在北京的展出，仅仅是我国和古巴文化交流的一个开端，我们以殷切的心情期望着今后有更多的反映站起来的英雄古巴人民新生活的版画作品来我国展出，有更多的反映人民的斗争和人民的新的精神面貌的作品展出。中国和古巴的版画艺术家将会在两国版画作品的互相观摩中彼此学习，增进友谊。
    中国和古巴人民的友谊万岁！
