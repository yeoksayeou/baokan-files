    Horse-Breeding Expert Pan Weiyi
    Xu Zhenshan
    Pan Weiyi, a horse-breeding expert from the Second Production Team of the Labor Management Area of the Guofu Commune in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang, has developed a complete set of horse-breeding experiences from long-term production practices. In eight years, he has ensured that all workhorses are strong, all mares are successfully mated and conceive, all pregnant mares give birth, and all foals survive. The number of horses he raises has grown from the initial twenty-five to one hundred and thirty. Pan Weiyi proudly says, "There are no horses that cannot be raised well, only people who cannot raise horses well."
    Aspiring to Raise Horses Well
    Eight years ago, Pan Weiyi was the captain of this production team. Due to the team's lack of collective horse-raising experience at the time, the horses were all very weak, which affected production. Pan Weiyi was disturbed day and night by this matter. He decided to request to the superiors to become a breeder and resolutely raise the horses well. The news of Pan Weiyi's request to become a breeder quickly spread. Someone asked him, "Don't you mind getting dirty by giving up being a cadre to raise horses?" He said, "Horses are the capital for growing crops and the lifeline of agricultural production. If the horses are not raised well, the land cannot be cultivated well, which will affect grain production and economic construction."
    Because Pan Weiyi raises horses well and the number of horses develops rapidly, the cultivated area of this production team has increased year by year, and the degree of intensive cultivation has improved year by year, which has greatly contributed to increasing grain production. In 1957, the cultivated land of this production team increased by more than 400 mu compared with 1952, with each workhorse bearing 75 mu, and the yield per mu of grain crops reached 180 jin. In 1959, the cultivated land increased by more than 500 mu compared with 1957, with each workhorse bearing 78 mu, and the yield per mu of grain was 266 jin, an increase of more than 50% compared with 1957. This year, the cultivated land has been further expanded, and grain crops have also achieved a good harvest. The commune members enthusiastically praised him, saying:
    "Pan Weiyi is a horse-breeding expert, a master of ensuring grain production through animal husbandry."
    Learning from Experience, Creating Experience
    Pan Weiyi's father, Pan Wanqing, had raised horses for landlords for more than thirty years and accumulated some experience in grazing, feeding, protecting pregnancies, and raising foals. In order to raise horses well, Pan Weiyi often asked his father for advice and applied what he learned to his horse-raising work. Pan Weiyi became a breeder just in time for winter. How to ensure that weak horses safely survive the winter? According to his father's experience, he added a layer of windbreak outside the simple stable, repaired the draughty places in the stable, and fed more than a dozen weaker horses in single troughs. In addition to feeding the horses during the day, he added grass and feed on time at night, fed them fine grass and fragrant feed, gave them warm water, and led them out for a walk early in the morning. With such careful feeding, by the spring of the following year, the weak horses had all recovered and reached more than 80% fat.
    In his horse-raising work, Pan Weiyi not only studied and applied existing experience but also created many new experiences. He adopted an attitude of both believing in and not being blindly devoted to old experiences. This realistic attitude enabled him to master and develop some of the inherent horse-raising experiences of the peasants. In the past, the peasants in this area advocated "standing horses, lying cows," and horses rested standing up. When grazing, horses also rested standing up after eating their fill. He felt that this practice was unreasonable. "People lie down to sleep and rest to restore their strength. Why not let horses lie down to rest? Wouldn't it be faster for horses to restore their strength by lying down?" To verify whether his idea was practical, when grazing horses at night, he slowly drove the horses, letting them eat grass while walking forward. When they were full in the middle of the night, he let the horses lie down to rest for two to three hours, and then drove them up to graze again. Before dawn, the horses were full again and their strength had been restored. In the past, when tilling the land, the horses generally lost weight because of the hot weather and hard work, and the horses did not rest well standing up. Since adopting the practice of lying down to rest, the horses not only did not lose weight but also gained weight.
    In July 1958, a mare in a nearby production team gave birth to a foal, which died immediately after birth. It is common for foals to die after birth. What was the reason? Pan Weiyi asked many elderly people and veterinarians, but no one could answer. In order to find out the reason, he dissected the dead horse and observed it more than a dozen times. Finally, he found a blood clot in the foal's throat. What was the reason for this? He visited the breeder of the foal. It turned out that the mare was in labor and had abdominal pain, so she was restless, lying down and getting up, and then lying down and getting up again. Because of the sudden rising and lying down, the foal suffocated in the mare's abdomen. After finding the reason, he scratched the mares he raised for their first time lying down, keeping them quiet until they had finished giving birth to the foals, and then let the mares get up. As a result, the foals born to the mares he raised did not die "before touching the ground."
    Because of his careful study, Pan Weiyi gradually mastered the habits and living habits of horses and could tell what horses needed from their calls and actions. For example, if a horse called while pawing the ground with its hooves, he knew that the horse was hungry; if a horse did not like to eat grass and stared at people with both eyes, it was thirsty; if a horse kept rolling around, it had a stomachache. Because he mastered the habits and living habits of horses, he supplied the horses with what they needed in a timely manner, making the horses full of energy, fat, and strong.
    Finding the Laws of Horse-Raising
    "Pay attention to both ends of a mare's pregnancy" is the experience Pan Weiyi summarized from long-term practice. One month after a mare becomes pregnant, the fetus is just beginning to form; in the last month of pregnancy, the fetus develops very quickly. These two periods are critical for protecting the pregnancy, and the mare and fetus need a lot of nutrition. The so-called "paying attention to both ends" means that during these two periods, special care should be taken in feeding and reasonable use should be made. In the early and late stages of a mare's pregnancy, feed more fine grass and concentrate, drink warm water, and fully guarantee the nutritional needs of the fetus and the mare. He fed pregnant mares in single troughs, told them to do light work, not to go on long trips, and not to go on three platforms (well platform, millstone platform, mill platform), and to lift the reins frequently when drinking water (to prevent choking the foal). In this way, pregnant mares did not have miscarriages or become weak, and the foals were born with sufficient strength, laying a good foundation for the development of the foals.
    "Foals pass five hurdles at birth" is Pan Weiyi's fundamental experience in ensuring the survival of all foals. In the past, many people in this area said, "It is easy to raise big horses, but it is difficult to produce foals." What is the difficulty? It is because no one takes care of the mares when they give birth, and foals are most likely to suffocate; in cold weather, they are easily frozen to death; and in damp stables, they are easily sick and die. These are the first hurdle for foals to survive – the birth hurdle. In order for foals to pass this hurdle well, Pan Weiyi built a separate foal-producing shed for pregnant mares and moved them into the foal-producing shed a few days before they gave birth. When a mare was about to give birth, he did not leave for a moment, and the foal was taken into the house as soon as it was born. This prevented suffocation, freezing, and death from disease. For about ten days after birth, foals run around everywhere and are easily kicked or bitten by big horses in the herd. This is another hurdle for foals to survive – the "ten-day hurdle." Based on this situation, Pan Weiyi took the mare and foal to a place with fences around them from the third day after the foal was born and fed them separately for about twenty days. When the foal grows to about 100 days old and can eat grass and feed, the mare's milk is also reduced, and the foal is prone to diarrhea due to indigestion. This is the "hundred-day hurdle." In order for the foal to overcome this hurdle, Pan Weiyi fed a small amount of hay leaves and sorghum broken seeds (broken sorghum), corn bran, and other concentrated feed in advance, and then gradually switched from concentrated to coarse feed, from small to large amounts. This can not only solve the problem of insufficient mare's milk but also effectively prevent the occurrence of foal diarrhea. When the foal is about ten months old, it encounters the fourth hurdle – the "coughing hurdle." When the foal coughs, it does not like to eat grass and needs about a month to pass. During this time, if you do not pay attention to careful feeding, the foal will lose weight and become weak in mild cases, and die in severe cases. Pan Weiyi's solution to this problem is to wash the coughing area with salt water every morning to help it heal as soon as possible, and to feed some fine grass and feed so that the foal can safely pass the "coughing hurdle." When the foal is about thirty months old, it encounters the biggest hurdle – the "tooth shedding hurdle." It takes a foal a year to shed a tooth. During this year, if you neglect feeding management, the foal is prone to weakness and death. What to do? Pan Weiyi took special care, fed the tooth-shedding foal in a single trough, fed soft grass and feed, mixed the grass with soybean cake water first, and finally fed soybean cake flour and corn bran, feeding five times a day and night, so that the horse loved to eat grass and ate enough.
    Breeding Expert, Good Doctor for Horses
    Pan Weiyi is very concerned about the breeding of mares. He said, "How can we produce more foals if mares are not bred? How can we increase livestock power for production?" As long as he sees a mare, he knows whether it is in heat. When he encounters a mare in heat, he takes the horse to the breeding station for breeding. If it is not accurate once, he breeds it twice, until it is accurate. This year, an old red mule mare was bred seven times before it was accurate. Because he is not afraid of hardship in breeding mares, all the mares that can be bred in the team are fully bred and pregnant every year.
    In his long-term horse-raising practice, Pan Weiyi has also explored and tested many methods for treating sick horses. In the winter of 1958, a horse broke its hind leg joint in a fight. The injury was very serious, with fresh blood flowing straight out, and it could not move. Some commune members said, "This horse is no good. Even if it gets better, it will be disabled. It's better to kill it." Pan Weiyi said, "This is the property of the People's Commune and must not be killed. I am determined to cure it." He got up early and worked late every day to wash the horse's legs and wrap them with self-made medicine packs. After four months of careful feeding and treatment, the horse recovered and was able to do heavy work. The commune members said, "Pan Weiyi is really a good doctor for horses."
    Under the cultivation and education of the Party, Pan Weiyi takes pride in contributing to the collective cause, studies diligently, finds the laws of horse-raising, and creates a miracle of not killing a horse in eight years, making the horses develop at a high speed and becoming a pacesetter in horse-raising in Baiquan County. When the county, commune, district, and team leaders praised him, he always said, "These achievements are the result of the Party's cultivation and education of me. The experience was created by everyone working together. Without the leadership of the Party and the help of everyone, no one could do it!"

    养马能手潘维义
    许振山
    黑龙江拜泉县国富公社劳动管理区第二生产队养马能手潘维义，从长期生产实践中，摸索出整套养马经验。他在八年的时间里，做到了役马全壮，母马全配全准，孕马全生，幼驹全活。他饲养的马匹已由最初的二十五匹发展到一百三十匹。潘维义豪迈地说：“没有养不好的马，只有养不好马的人。”
    立大志养好马
    八年前，潘维义是这个生产队的队长。由于当时队里缺少集体养马经验，马匹都很瘦弱，影响了生产。潘维义为这件事昼夜不宁。他决定向上级要求当饲养员，坚决要把马养好。潘维义要求当饲养员的事很快就传开了。有人问他：“干部不当，去养马，不嫌脏吗？”他说：“马是种庄稼的本钱，是农业生产的命根子，如果养不好马，就种不好地，就会影响粮食生产和经济建设。”
    由于潘维义养马养得好，马匹发展得快，使这个生产队耕地面积逐年增加，深耕细作程度逐年提高，对增产粮食起到了很大作用。1957年，这个生产队耕地比1952年增加四百多亩，每匹役马负担七十五亩，粮食作物亩产达一百八十斤。1959年耕地又比1957年增加五百多亩，每匹役马负担七十八亩，亩产粮二百六十六斤，比1957年提高50％以上。今年耕地又有扩大，粮食作物又获得了很好的收成。社员们热情地称赞他说：
    “潘维义是养马专家，是以畜保粮的能手。”
    学习经验　创造经验
    潘维义的父亲潘万清，曾给地主养过三十多年马，积累了一些放牧、饲养、保胎、育驹等经验。潘维义为了把马养好，经常向他父亲请教，并把学会了的东西具体地运用到养马工作中去。潘维义当饲养员，正赶上冬季。怎样使瘦弱马匹安全过冬？他按着他父亲的经验，在简易马棚外边加上了一层防风障，对马棚透风的地方也作了修理，并把较瘦弱的十几匹马单槽饲养，他除白天喂马外，夜间按时添草加料，给细草香料吃，饮温水，起早再牵出蹓一次。这样精心饲养，到第二年春天，瘦弱马都复壮了，达到了八成膘以上。
    潘维义在养马工作中，不仅研究运用固有经验，而且还创造出许多新的经验。他对待老经验，采取既相信、但又不迷信的态度。这种实事求是的态度，使他掌握并发展了农民固有的一些养马经验。这个地方农民过去是主张“站马卧牛”，马都是站着休息，放牧时，马吃饱了也是站着休息。他觉得这种做法不合理，“人躺下睡觉休息，恢复体力，为什么不让马趴下休息呢？马趴下休息恢复体力不是更快吗？”他为证实自己的想法是否合于实际，在放夜马时，他慢慢赶着马，让马一边吃草一边往前走，放到半夜，马吃饱了，他就让马趴下休息二到三个小时，然后再赶起来放，不到天亮马又都吃饱了，体力也恢复了。过去趟地时，因天热活累，马站立着休息不好，普遍降膘，自从采用趴下休息以后，马不但不掉膘，而且还都增了膘。
    1958年7月，附近生产队有一匹母马下驹，马驹生下来就死了。马驹生下来就死是常见的事，什么原因呢？潘维义问过许多老年人和兽医，谁也答不出来。为了弄清原因，他把死马解剖了，观察了十几遍，终于找到小马咽喉内塞着一块血饼子。这又是什么原因呢？他访问了这匹小马的饲养员，原来是母马临产腹痛，不安静，趴下起来，再趴下再起来，由于猛起猛趴，小马被窝死在大马腹中。他找到原因之后，对自己饲养的临产母马，第一次趴下，就为马挠痒，使马安静，直到产完驹，才让母马起来。因而他饲养的母马产的驹没有“落草”就死的。
    潘维义由于细心钻研，逐渐掌握了马的习性和生活规律，能从马的叫声、行动看出马的需要来。比如，马一边叫一边用蹄子扒地，他知道这是马饿了；马不爱吃草，瞪着两只眼睛看人，这是渴了；马不住打滚，这是肚子疼。他由于掌握了马的习性和生活规律，及时地供给了马所需要的东西，使马个个精神饱满，又肥又壮。
    找到了养马规律
    “母马怀孕抓两头”，这是潘维义从长期实践中总结出来的经验。母马怀胎后一个月，胎马刚刚形成；怀孕最后一个月，胎马发育很快。这两个时期都是保胎的关键，而且母马和胎马需要的营养又多。所谓
  “抓两头”，就是在这两个时期，要特别精心饲养，合理使役。在母马怀孕初期和后期，就多喂些细草精料，饮温水，充分保证胎马和母马的营养需要。他用单槽饲养孕马，叫孕马干轻活，不上长途，不上三台（井台、碾台、磨台），饮水勤提缰绳（防止呛掉驹）。这样，孕马没有流产和瘦弱的，而且小马先天足，为幼驹发育打下了好基础。
    “小马出生过五关”，是潘维义保证幼驹全活的根本经验。过去这个地方有许多人说：“养大马容易，产小马难”。难在那里呢？就是因为孕马下驹时，没人照管，小马最容易窝死；冷天，容易冻死；马圈潮湿，又容易病死。这些是小马成活的第一道关口——出生关。为让小马过好这一道关口，潘维义单独给孕马建立了一个产驹棚，孕马产驹的前几天就把它牵进产驹棚。孕马临产，他一时也不离开，马驹生下来就抱到屋里去。这样就防止了窝死、冻死和病死。小马驹出生后的十天左右，到处乱跑，跑到马群里很容易被大马踢坏或咬坏。这是小马成活的又一关——“十天关”。潘维义根据这个情况，从小马出生后的第三天，把母马和小马牵到周围有栅栏的地方，单独喂养到二十天左右。小马长到百天左右能吃草料了，母马奶也少了，小马容易因消化不良得下痢病，这是“百天关”。潘维义为使小马闯过这一关，提前喂少量的谷草叶和高粱破子（破碎了的高粱）、苞米糠等精饲料，以后逐渐由精到粗，由少到多。这样，既可以解决母马奶不够吃的问题，又有效地防止了小马下痢病的发生。小马驹出生十个月时，又遇到第四关——“喷喉关”。小马喷喉时，不爱吃草，需要一个月左右时间，才能过去。在这个时间里，如果不注意精心饲养，轻的掉膘瘦弱，重的死亡。潘维义解决这个问题的办法，是每天早晨用盐水把喷喉处洗一遍，助其早愈，并喂一些细草细料，使小马安然无事地度过“喷喉关”。小马出生后三十个月左右，又遇到最大的一关——“脱牙关”，小马脱完一口牙需要一年的时间。在这一年内，忽视了饲养管理，小马很容易瘦弱、死亡。怎么办？潘维义采取特殊照顾的办法，把脱牙的小马单槽饲养，喂软草软料，把草先用豆饼水拌了，最后喂豆饼面与苞米糠，一昼夜喂五遍，使马爱吃草，吃得饱。
    繁殖能手马的良医
    潘维义对母马配种非常关心，他说：“母马不配种怎能多产驹？怎能为生产增加畜力呢？”他只要一看母马就知道发没发情，遇到发情的母马，他便把马牵到配种站配种，一次不准，配两次，一直到配准为止。今年有一匹老红骡马，一直配了七次才准。由于他不怕辛苦地为母马配种，使全队可繁殖的母马年年全配满怀。
    潘维义在长期养马实践中，还摸索、试验成功了许多医治病马的方法。1958年冬季，有一匹马因踢架，把后腿骨节踢坏了，伤很重，鲜血直流，不能走动。有的社员说：“这马没个好了，就是好了，也是个残废，不如杀了。”潘维义说：“这是人民公社的财产，绝不能杀，我坚决把它医治好。”他每天起早贪黑地给马洗腿，用自制的药包扎。经过四个月的精心饲养和治疗，这匹马好了，能干重活了。社员们说：“潘维义真是治马的良医。”
    潘维义在党的培养教育下，以为集体事业贡献力量为荣，刻苦钻研，摸到了养马规律，创造了八年没死一匹马的奇迹，使马匹高速度发展，成为拜泉县养马的标兵。当县、社、区、队领导上表扬他时，他总是说：“这些成绩是党对我培养教育的结果，经验是大家齐心创造的，如果没有党的领导，大家的帮助，谁也办不到啊！”
