    Bathed in the October Sunshine
    P. Mikheyev, Pig Breeder at the "Arzhenka" State Breeding Farm, Raskazovsky District, Tambov Oblast, USSR
    In the old days before the revolution, the Tambov region was a land of poverty and hunger. The peasants of Tambov lived a miserable life. It's hard to believe when you hear the old people talk about it. Our fellow countryman, the writer Chirpigolev, described rural life at that time: "The rural areas of Tambov, with their poverty, filth, and gray, desolate scenes, are shocking."
    That was the past. Now, it's just something that remains in people's memories. Since the sun of October rose over our country, the Tambov region has undergone unrecognizable changes. Life here has fundamentally changed. Today, when you walk through our fields and villages, everything around you is pleasing to the eye. The Soviet government has brought a happy life to the Russian people; it has given people great happiness.
    In our village, there are rows of sturdy, bright houses, the tall buildings of clubs and cultural palaces stand tall, and the houses in the livestock farms are also very good. Electric lights shine, and cheerful songs float everywhere. There is also abundance at home: good furnishings, radios, musical instruments, and books. Rural residents wear beautiful clothes, they eat well, they plant flowers and decorate their houses with flowers. Our peasants have also grown spiritually; they love culture and education.
    We live in an amazing era! Our rural economy is growing year by year. This is already a completely different kind of agriculture; it is collectivized, mechanized, and highly commercialized. My farm alone has one hundred and seventy-six tractors, one hundred and eighty cars, and many other top-quality technical equipment. Our breeding farm has thousands of ties with the entire country and with various people's democracies. Every day, our farm ships out a wagonload of breeding and edible eggs, tons of poultry meat, beef, and pork, and eight to ten tanker cars of milk. This kind of wealth is commonplace in Tambov.
    What good care is given to ordinary people, to working people, here! People who work well here are honored. For example, Evgenia Ivanovna Andreyeva is a clear example. She is the chairman of the "Comintern" collective farm in Michurinsky District. A few years ago, few people knew her. However, in a short period of time, this ordinary Tambov woman became famous throughout the country. Now, she is a Hero of Socialist Labor, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. She not only turned the collective farm she leads into the most advanced farm, but also one of the initiators of the competition with the United States in terms of livestock product output per capita.
    Today is our grand festival. On this happy day, we Soviet people especially take pride in labor. We strive to live and work in a communist way, as the great Lenin taught us. Labor helps people correct old and outdated shortcomings, and labor improves people's qualities. Many outstanding workers have emerged in our farm. For example, the staff of the first poultry farm led by Hero of Socialist Labor Ekaterina Fedorovna Shmadchenko is like that. This year, the poultry farmers proposed to pick ten million eggs, that is, two hundred and five eggs per hen. They fulfilled their promise well. In nine months, the poultry farmers have already picked eight and a half million eggs. Young poultry farmers Lyudmila Shishkina and Zoya Vasilyeva work in this farm. They take care of six thousand hens, while the quota for each person is only two thousand five hundred. Poultry farmer E. A. Voropaeva is well-known here; in nine months, each hen she raised produced one hundred and seventy-four eggs. Milkmaids Lyubov Lobkova and M. M. Karnaeva are also well-known; in nine months, they milked three thousand three hundred and forty-five kilograms of milk from each cow.
    We greet the October Revolution Festival with outstanding labor achievements. The state has received seventeen million eggs from our farm, one million more than in the same period last year. We have also handed over a lot of milk and meat to the state.
    That's great!
    In the common struggle to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, I also strive not to fall behind. I came to the pig farm four years ago, after being demobilized from the army. I like this new job very much. I originally planned to raise eight hundred pigs a year. But by October, I had already raised two thousand four hundred and six pigs and handed over two thousand and thirty-six quintals of meat to the state. This is equivalent to three annual targets. Throughout this year, I will raise three thousand one hundred pigs. In my work at the pig farm, I also learned to drive a tractor and want to become a machinery operator. I am preparing to participate in the correspondence department of the agricultural technical school.
    Not long ago, I visited Mikhail Andreyevich Lukashkin, a famous worker at the "Glukhovsky" state farm in the Umaizi District. This meeting was exciting. He served in the army for many years and was a major. After demobilization, he went to the state farm to work as a pig breeder. Not long ago, he received a congratulatory telegram from Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This is a noble award! Only in our country can labor be valued so much.
    On October 22, two weeks before the October Revolution Festival, I also had the same great event. On this day, I, an ordinary pig breeder, also received a congratulatory telegram from Comrade Khrushchev. He heartily congratulated me, wishing me health, happiness in my personal life, and new achievements in my work. On October 25, representatives from many districts in Tambov came to us. I stood on the podium, feeling excited and happy. The Young Pioneers presented me with flowers...
    Living in our country, feeling the care of our dear party, feeling that we are working for the motherland and for the Soviet people, how happy it is!

    在十月阳光的普照下
    苏联唐波夫州拉斯卡佐夫区“阿尔仁卡”种畜场养猪员  普·米赫耶夫
    唐波夫这个地方在革命前的旧时代，是贫穷和饥饿之乡。唐波夫的农民生活得很苦。听老年人讲起来，简直难以相信。我们的同乡、作家契尔皮戈列夫这样描写当时农村的生活：“唐波夫的农村，它那贫穷、肮脏的环境，那一片灰色的凄凉景象令人吃惊。”
    这是过去的情况了。现在，这只是残存在人们记忆中的事情。自从在我们国家的上空升起十月的太阳，唐波夫地方就起了难以辨认的变化。这里的生活根本改观了。如今你走到我们的田野和村庄，四周都是惹人爱看的。苏维埃政权给俄罗斯人民带来了愉快的生活，它给了人们巨大的幸福。
    我们村子里有一排排坚固明亮的房子，俱乐部和文化宫的高大建筑物耸立着，养畜场的房子也很好。电灯照耀，愉快的歌声四处飘扬。在家里也很富足：良好的摆设，收音机、乐器和书籍。农村居民穿着漂亮的衣服，他们吃得饱，吃得好，他们种植花草，用鲜花来装饰自己的房子。我们的农民在精神上也成长起来了，他们爱喜文化、教育。
    我们生活在惊人的时代！我们农村的经济逐年在增长着。这已经完全是另外一种农业了，它是集体化的、机械化的、高度商品率的农业。光是我工作的这一个农场就有一百七十六部拖拉机、一百八十辆汽车以及好多其它各种头等质量的技术设备。我们的种畜场同整个国家、同各人民民主国家有千丝万缕的联系。每天我们场都要往外运出一车皮的育种和食用的蛋类、成吨的禽肉、牛肉和猪肉、八辆到十辆油槽车的牛乳。这种富有的现象在唐波夫是司空见惯的了。
    我们这里的普通人、劳动的人受到多么好的关怀呀！在我们这里劳动好的人，是光荣的。例如，叶夫根尼·伊瓦诺夫娜·安德烈耶娃，就是一个显明的例子。她是米丘林区“共产国际”集体农庄的主席。几年以前，很少有人知道她。可是，就在短短的时期里，这个普通的唐波夫妇女誉满全国。现在，她是社会主义劳动英雄、苏联最高苏维埃的代表。她不仅把她领导的集体农庄变成最先进的农庄，而且是在畜产品按人口计算的产量方面同美国竞赛的倡导者之一。
    今天是我们的盛大节日。在这个愉快的日子，我们苏联人特别以劳动引为光荣。我们力求像伟大列宁教导我们的那样，按共产主义方式生活和劳动。劳动帮助人们改正旧的过时的毛病，劳动提高人的品质。我们场里出现了许多杰出的劳动者。例如，社会主义劳动英雄叶卡契琳娜·费多罗夫娜·什玛德钦柯领导的第一种禽场的工作人员就是这样的。今年养禽者提出要拣一千万只蛋，即每只母鸡产蛋二百零五个。他们很好地执行了自己的诺言。九个月来，养禽员已经拣了八百五十万只蛋。年青的养禽者柳德密拉·施什金娜和卓娅·瓦西里也娃，在这个场里工作。她们照看六千只母鸡，而每个人的定额只是二千五百只。养禽员叶·阿·伏罗帕也娃在我们这里是很出名的，九个月来她饲养的每只母鸡产了一百七十四只蛋。女挤奶员柳苞夫·洛布可娃和玛·玛·卡尔那也娃，也是很有名的，九个月来她们从每头乳牛挤了三千三百四十五公斤奶。
    我们用优秀的劳动成就来迎接十月革命节。国家从我们农场已得到一千七百万只蛋，比去年同期多了一百万。我们还交给国家很多牛奶和肉类。
    这很好！
    在为提前完成七年计划的共同斗争中，我也努力不落在人后。我是四年前来到养猪场的，是从军队复员的。这一新的工作很合我的心意。我原订一年喂养八百头猪。可是到10月份我已经喂养了二千四百零六头猪，向国家交了二千零三十六公担肉。这等于三个年度指标。在这一整年，我要喂养三千一百头猪。在猪场工作中，我又学习开拖拉机，想当一个机械操使者。我正准备参加农业技术学校的函授部学习。
    不久以前，我到乌麦兹区“格鲁霍夫斯基”国营农场著名劳动者米海伊尔·安德烈也维奇·卢卡什金那里去访问。这次会见令人激动。他在军队里服务多年，当过少校。复员后他到国营农场担任养猪员。不久以前，他收到苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫的贺电。这是崇高的奖赏！只有在我们国家里劳动才能受到如此的重视。
    10月22日，在离十月革命节还有两个星期的时候，我也有了同样的大喜事。就在这一天，我这个普通的养猪员也收到了赫鲁晓夫同志的贺电。他衷心地祝贺我，希望我健康、个人生活幸福和在劳动中取得新成就。10月25日，唐波夫的许多区派代表到我们这里来。我站在讲台上，感到兴奋、幸福。少先队员们向我献花……
    生活在我们国家里，感到亲爱的党的关怀，感到我们在为祖国、为苏维埃人劳动，这是多么幸福呵！
