	Early-Maturing Grapes
	Zhang Changgong
	A farmer, appearing to be in his thirties, is picking grapes in the orchard, harvesting the fruits he has cultivated with his own sweat. How delighted he is! Look at him, his eyes full of smiles, his face full of smiles. The sunlight shines through the sparse and dense grape leaves onto his face. That simple and resolute face is now radiant, the smile from the bottom of his heart merging with the brilliant sunshine. And look at those clusters of grapes, each one like a pearl, like beautiful jade, like amber, crystal clear, round, and transparent.... What big grapes, what a beautiful orchard! The grapes of my hometown are harvested again!
	I hold a small newspaper sent from my hometown—the Zhaowuda Grassland—in my hand, looking at the pictures on the newspaper. Suddenly, the scene of this farmer picking grapes catches my eye. The photojournalist is truly a master, he can capture in an instant the most joyful mood, the most beautiful aspirations, the pride in labor, the confidence on the road ahead!
	Hey, I actually recognize this grape picker. Isn't he Dai Yutang from the Wusan People's Commune in Chifeng? That's right, look at his simple and honest appearance; look at his determination to complete the Party's work.... Who else could it be? Dai Yutang, this fruit tree expert from a peasant background, the vice principal of the Wusan Commune Agricultural Middle School, I spent half a month with him at the National Conference of Heroes in Culture and Education this summer. His unwavering loyalty to the Party's cause, his drive, momentum, and dedication to his work, always lingers in my mind. For half a month, we became good friends, and I am so eager to visit their school orchard.
	The photo in the newspaper gradually enlarges, it seems as if Dai Yutang himself is standing in front of me, still as happy as when he was picking grapes, waving his arms, jumping up and down, like a child, describing to me the solemn and magnificent scene in the Great Hall of the People:
	"Oh my, this time we farmers have really ascended to heaven! In the old society, people said there was a heaven, but who has ever seen heaven? Wasn't it just a trick by the landlords to deceive people: 'You work hard for me like donkeys and horses, and you will go to heaven after you die.' Bah! To hell with their heaven! Look, now we farmers have entered the real heaven!"
	"Really, it's really heaven! Looking up, tens of thousands of lights above our heads are like stars in the sky, and in the middle of them, the big and bright one is a red five-pointed star. This red five-pointed star is our Chinese Communist Party, it illuminates the Great Hall of the People, illuminates the whole of China, turns the whole of China into heaven, and lets all the Chinese people ascend to heaven!"
	The more we talked, the more we got along, and later we talked about everything. He talked to me the most about introducing their Wusan Commune Agricultural Middle School, introducing the orchard in their school.
	This agricultural middle school was established in the autumn of 1958 during the Great Leap Forward. In the spirit of diligence and frugality in running the school, the commune Party committee asked the school to start from scratch and implement a part-work, part-study system. After two years of arduous school building, the students now manage 300 mu of fruit trees, 300 mu of school fields, and 150 mu of forestry base.
	When he talked about managing fruit trees, he had even more to say. He said that their school has more than 4.15 million fruit trees and seedlings of various kinds, including apples, peaches, plums, etc. There are six varieties of grapes alone, such as "Rose Fragrant" and "Seedless." The grapes planted in 1957 will bear fruit this year....
	In the Wusan Commune, people call Dai Yutang a fruit tree expert. His knowledge of fruit tree cultivation, management, grafting, and other aspects is exceptionally profound. When he explained the method of pruning fruit trees to me, he used a wonderful metaphor, the main idea being: the main branch in the middle of the fruit tree is called the central leadership branch. Be sure to protect it when pruning, otherwise, if you lose the leadership, each branch will extend sideways and become anarchic.
	The people listening nearby and I all laughed, but he spoke even more seriously, stubbornly making you believe that in the plant world there is also leadership, organization, and discipline.
	Once, I praised him for his superb skills. Who knew that such a big man would be so ashamed that his face turned red and his neck thickened. He turned his head and said, "Oh, Lao Zhang, without the Party's cultivation, how could I have achieved this! You haven't seen the suffering I endured in the past. If it weren't for the Party, my bones would have rotted away by now!"
	Yes, just as fruit trees need expert cultivation, the intelligence and talent of anyone does not come from self-struggle, but our Party, like the sun shining on the earth, awakens all vitality and opens the floodgates of the wisdom of the working people; it is our era that gives people the courage to move forward and points out the way forward! Isn't it true that since the Great Leap Forward, Dai Yutang's mind has not only been on fruit trees, but on nearly 300 students in the whole school. He is not only an expert in cultivating fruit trees, but also a gardener cultivating new rural youth! I didn't ask him in detail about the various sufferings he endured in the old society, but in those dark days, weren't millions of working people the same fate? They were not only unable to learn culture and receive education, but were also deprived of the right to survive! Isn't Dai Yutang one of them?
	The meeting was coming to an end, and the head of the Inner Mongolia delegation called on the people from each league attending the meeting to make leap forward plans after returning. Dai Yutang smiled and handed me his written plan to read, one was to ask me to give him some advice, and the other was to ask me to help him revise the wording. The plan was written on yellow cardboard. I didn't care about any revision, I read it in one breath, and I was so moved that my heart was warm. From this plan, you can see Dai Yutang's simple and down-to-earth energy, that resolute energy that will never stop until the goal is achieved. Not to mention the political and cultural courses that the school is preparing to add in the spirit of learning for application, but in terms of technical research, he boldly proposed: to create a rapid seedling breeding method to allow fruit tree seedlings to be out of the nursery two years in advance; to change the old method of cultivating grapes in the past—intercropping method, and to experiment with a cultivation method combining cutting and layering, so that grapes that can only bear fruit in seven years will be full of fruit in three years....
	Good, this is enough energy! This agricultural middle school—a new type of socialist school, will cultivate many new types of farmers to build a new countryside! I had nothing to say, and immediately went back to the room to revise my work plan. Compared with Dai Yutang, I was too conservative. After revising my plan, I felt that there was still a surge of energy in my heart.
	It has been less than half a year since I left my friend. How much change there should be in this short half a year! But I don't know how his plan is being implemented? Have the grapes planted in 1957 borne fruit?
	I quickly woke up from my reverie, rubbed my eyes, and looked carefully at the photo and its description, which clearly stated:
	"The Wusan Commune Agricultural Middle School has a bumper harvest of Rose Fragrant grapes. Under the guidance of the Party's policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, Dai Yutang, the vice principal of the school, and the students jointly researched and created a new cultivation method, which shortened the grape fruiting period by four years..."
	"Ah!" I spoke to the smiling friend in the picture: "Hello, old friend? You do what you say, you truly deserve to be an advanced worker, this is the communist style of our era!"
	In the picture, the smile lines on Dai Yutang's face seemed to be deeper, and he seemed to be saying loudly to me:
	"Friend, without the Party's cultivation, how could I have achieved this?..."

    早熟的葡萄
    张长弓
    一个三十来岁的农民模样的人在果园里摘葡萄，亲手采摘自己用汗水灌溉过的果实。他是多末喜悦呵！你瞧他，满眼笑意，满脸笑意，阳光透过疏密相间的葡萄叶洒在他的脸上，那张纯朴而又坚毅的面孔，现在竟光彩四射，发自心底的笑容和灿烂的阳光融合在一起了。再看那一嘟噜一嘟噜的葡萄，颗颗像珍珠、像美玉、像琥珀，晶莹、圆润、透明……。好大的葡萄呵，好美的果园呵！故乡的葡萄又丰收了！
    我手里捧着从故乡——昭乌达草原寄来的一张小报，看着报上的几张图片。突然，这个农民摘葡萄的画面吸住了我的眼睛。摄影记者真是个高手，他竟能在一瞬间抓住人们最欢快的心情、最美丽的向往、对劳动的自豪、在前进道路上的信心！
    咦，摘葡萄的这人我竟认出来了。他不就是赤峰五三人民公社的戴玉堂吗？不错，你瞧他那纯朴直憨的样儿；你瞧他对完成党的工作那股坚决劲儿……不是他是谁呢？戴玉堂，这个农民出身的果树专家，这个五三公社农业中学的副校长，今年夏天，在全国文教群英会上我曾和他相处半月之久，他那对党的事业的耿耿忠心，他对工作的那种干劲、冲劲、钻研劲，始终萦绕在我的心头。半月来，我们竟成了好朋友，我是多末想着到他们中学果园里看一看呵。
    报纸上的照片渐渐扩大起来，似乎就是戴玉堂本人站在我的面前，他还像摘葡萄时那样喜悦，挥舞着手臂，跳着脚，像小孩子似地跟我描绘人民大会堂里庄严、辉煌的景象：
    “哎呀呀，这回咱庄稼人真的登上天堂了！在旧社会，人们说天上有个天堂，天堂谁见过？还不是地主骗人的鬼把戏：‘你们像驴马似地给我苦挣苦受，死了好上天堂。’呸！去他的鬼天堂吧！你瞧，如今咱们庄稼人进了真正的天堂啦！”
      “真的呀，真的是天堂呀！抬头看，头顶上万盏明灯就像满天星斗，那当中又大又亮的是一颗红五星，这颗红五星就是咱们的中国共产党，它照亮了人民大会堂，照亮了全中国，把全中国都变成天堂，让全中国的老百姓都登上天堂！”
    我和他越谈越投缘，后来竟无话不说。他跟我谈得最多的是介绍他们五三公社的农业中学，介绍他们中学里的果园。
    这所农业中学是在大跃进的1958年秋成立的。公社党委本着勤俭办学的精神，叫这个学校白手起家，实行半耕半读制度。经过两年艰苦的建校过程，现在学生们经营着三百亩果树，三百亩校田和一百五十亩林业基地。
    一谈起经营果树，他的话更多了，他说，他们中学里有各种果树和幼苗四百一十五万多棵，其中有苹果、桃、李等等，光葡萄就有六个品种，像什么“玫瑰香”咧，“无籽粒”咧，1957年栽培的葡萄，今年就要让它结果……。
    戴玉堂在五三公社里，人们都叫他果树专家，他对于果树栽培、经营、嫁接等方面的知识是异常渊博的。他在给我讲果树的修枝方法时，竟用了一段妙不可言的比喻，大意是：果树中间的主枝叫做中央领导枝，修枝时千万要保护它，否则，失去了领导，各枝则旁逸斜出，变成无政府状态了。
    旁边听的人和我都大笑起来，他却讲得越发认真，固执地让你相信，在植物界中也是有领导、有组织、有纪律的。
    有一次，我称赞他技艺精深，谁知，他那么大的人竟羞得脸红脖子粗，把头一扭说：“唉，老张呵，没有党的培养，咱能到这份儿上！你没看咱过去受的苦，若没有党，这阵儿咱连骨渣也烂尽了！”
    是呵，正像果树需要专家栽培一样，任何人的聪明才智都不是自我奋斗得来的，而是我们的党像阳光普照大地那样，唤醒了一切生机，打开了劳动人民智慧的闸门；是我们的时代赋予了人们前进的勇气，指出了前进的道路！不是嘛，从大跃进以来，戴玉堂的心思不仅是在果树上，而是在全校将近三百名学生身上。他不只是培育果树的专家，而且是培育新农村青年的园丁！我没有细问他在旧社会所受的种种苦处，但，在那黑暗的日子里，千百万劳动人民不都是同一命运吗？他们不仅不能学文化、受教育，还被剥夺了生存的权利！戴玉堂不就是他们中间的一个吗？
    会议快结束了，内蒙古代表团的团长，号召各盟来开会的人作回去以后的跃进计划。戴玉堂笑嘻嘻地把他写的计划拿给我看，一是让我给他提提意见，一是要我帮他修修辞儿。那计划是写在黄板纸上的。我那里还顾得上什么修辞儿啊，一口气读完了它，感动得心里热乎乎的。从这个计划里就可以看出戴玉堂那纯朴的、脚踏实地的劲儿，那刚毅的、不达到目的绝不终止的劲儿。且不说，学校里本着学以致用的精神准备增设的政治、文化课目，单说在技术研究方面，他竟然大胆地提出：要创造出快速育苗法，使果树幼苗提前两年出圃；要改变过去培植葡萄的老办法——套栽法，试验用杆插与压条相结合的栽培法，使七年才可以结果的葡萄，在三年内就果实累累……。
    好呵，这够劲头儿！这所农业中学——社会主义的新型学校，要培养出多少建设新农村的新型农民呵！我没有二话可说，回到屋里马上动手修订自己的工作计划，比起戴玉堂来我还是太保守了。改完了自己的计划以后，觉着还有一股劲儿在心里激荡着。
    离开我的朋友还不到半年，这短短的半年中该有多末大的变化呵！但不知他的计划实现的怎样？1957年栽的葡萄可曾结果？
    我忙从沉思中醒过来，揉揉眼睛细看那张照片和它的说明，那上面分明写着：
    “五三公社农业中学玫瑰香葡萄丰收。在党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针指导下，该校副校长戴玉堂和学生们共同研究，创造了新式培育法，使葡萄结果期间缩短四年……”
    “呵！”我冲着画面上欢笑的朋友讲起话来：“你好呵，老朋友？说到哪里做到哪里，真不愧是先进工作者，这就是我们时代的共产主义风格呵！”
    画面上，戴玉堂脸上的笑纹似乎更深了，他好像大声地向我说：
      “朋友，没有党的培养，咱能到这份儿上？……”
