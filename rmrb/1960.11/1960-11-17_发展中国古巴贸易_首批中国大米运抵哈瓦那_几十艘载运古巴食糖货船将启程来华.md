Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 15th: As the United States intensifies its economic blockade against Cuba, the first batch of nearly 10,000 tons of rice and beans from China arrived in Havana today. Dockworkers are joyfully unloading the cargo transported by a British freighter.

Havana newspapers have all published this news. "Revolución" headlined on its front page, "Rice Arrives from China!" The newspaper also published a commentary stating that, thanks to rice imports from China and the growing development of Cuba's own rice production, the Cuban people's rice needs will be met for the remainder of this year and throughout next year.

Since China and Cuba signed a trade and payment agreement in July of this year, economic and trade relations between the two countries have rapidly developed. The agreement stipulates that China will purchase 500,000 tons of sugar from Cuba, of which 350,000 tons have already been transacted and are expected to be shipped to China within this year. Currently, in various ports in Cuba, dockworkers are enthusiastically loading sugar onto ships. Dozens of freighters carrying Cuban sugar will set sail for China. According to the signed agreement, in addition to rice, Cuba will also purchase dozens of commodities urgently needed by Cuba from China, including trucks, motors, internal combustion engines, cultural goods, and industrial raw materials.

    发展中国古巴贸易
    首批中国大米运抵哈瓦那
    几十艘载运古巴食糖货船将启程来华
    新华社哈瓦那15日电　正当美国加紧对古巴进行经济封锁的时候，从中国运来的第一批大米和豆类近一万吨今天已经运到哈瓦那。码头工人正在兴高采烈地卸下这批由一条英国货轮运来的货物。
    哈瓦那各报纸都刊登了这条消息。“革命报”在第一版上的题目说，“从中国运来了大米！”这家报纸还发表评论说，由于从中国进口大米以及古巴自己的稻米生产日益发展，在今年剩下的时间和明年一年里，古巴人民对大米的需要将得到满足。
    自从今年7月中古两国签订贸易和支付协定以来，两国间的经济和贸易关系得到了迅速的发展。这项协定规定中国向古巴购买五十万吨食糖，其中三十五万吨已经成交，估计在今年内就能运往中国。目前，在古巴的各个港口上，码头工人正在热情地把食糖装上船。几十艘载着古巴食糖的货船将启程前往中国。根据已签订的协定，除了大米以外，古巴还将向中国购买数十种为古巴所迫切需要的商品，其中包括卡车、马达、内燃机、文化用品和工业原料等。
