Field Competition Accelerates Autumn Harvest
Lidu Commune Rallies for Competition, Finishing Late Rice Harvest in Five Days

(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 3rd dispatch) The Lidu Commune in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, set up pace-setters during the autumn harvest, and organized commune members to vigorously participate in field competitions centered around these pace-setters, enabling the entire commune to complete the late rice harvesting task in five days.

Field competition is a new form of competition to promote the autumn harvest. Its specific method is to select a group of skilled harvesters from the masses as pace-setters, and then organize these pace-setters to tour and perform in various places, mobilizing all commune members to create a surge in field competitions.

As soon as the field competition in Lidu Commune began, a situation of rapid harvesting and threshing emerged. As work efficiency increased steadily and progress accelerated day by day, the 30 young women of Lefeng Brigade organized themselves into five shock teams, such as the Seven Sisters, Le Lihua, Hongxia, Liu Hulan, and Hua Mulan teams, challenging each other to compete. On the first day, the Seven Sisters team was full of energy, harvesting and threshing 3,000 catties of rice, exceeding the quota by more than double, ranking first. The Le Lihua team, which lagged behind, caught up quickly, going to work ahead of time and leaving work behind schedule. The second day they harvested and threshed 3,200 catties of rice, winning first place in the competition. When the commune members of the entire brigade saw their enthusiastic competition, the young men organized youth shock teams, the old farmers organized Huang Zhong teams, the old women organized Yang Lingpo teams, and the children organized Luo Cheng teams. Soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals, some competed for rapid harvesting, some competed for rapid threshing, and some competed for picking up more ears of rice. A heated competition was launched. As a result, the autumn harvest progress of this team was twice as fast on the third day compared to the first day, and more than half as fast again on the fourth day compared to the third day. The entire team completed the autumn harvest in four days, six days ahead of schedule. Driven by the competition, the average autumn harvest efficiency of the entire commune was more than 360 catties of rice harvested and threshed per person per day, an increase of 30% compared to last year, generally exceeding the labor quota.

Field competitions encouraged commune members to harvest and thresh meticulously, greatly improving the quality of the autumn harvest.

Field competitions also quickly overcame many difficulties, promoting the comprehensive development of the autumn harvest. Some rice paddies were far from the village, or had deep mud and a lot of water, making the harvesting task arduous. Some teams had few people and a lot of land, resulting in insufficient harvesting labor. After field competitions were launched in these areas, various difficulties were overcome one by one. The fifth team of Jianliang Brigade had an autumn harvest area of 130 mu, but only eleven laborers. With a large task and little labor, the autumn harvest progress lagged behind the other brother teams, and the entire team needed half a month to complete the autumn harvest task. The brigade Party branch held a field competition here, transferring three Hua Mulan teams, four Wu Song teams, and five Luo Cheng teams from other teams. Some cut, some threshed, some picked up, and there were many people with great strength. They competed happily and worked fiercely, helping the fifth team harvest all the late rice in less than a day.

During the field competition, Party committees at all levels of the Lidu Commune also took many measures to ensure the sustained development of the competition. First, they insisted on on-site competition, on-site evaluation, and on-site awards. The competition was generally intense labor. Based on the different degrees of intensity, it was decided that the competition would only be held once a day, either one morning or one afternoon, or most of the day. After each competition, evaluations and awards were given immediately in the field. This only took ten minutes or so, allowing commune members to rest while completing the evaluation and awards, immediately encouraging commune members to continue their efforts to participate in the autumn harvest. Second, various advanced experiences were summarized and promoted in a timely manner to expand the results of the competition.

    田间比武加快秋收
    李渡公社大闹竞赛五天收完晚稻
    本报南昌3日电　江西临川县李渡公社在秋收中大树标兵，以标兵为中心组织社员大闹田间比武，使全社收打晚稻的任务在五天内完成。
    田间比武是推动秋收的一种新的竞赛形式。它的具体作法是：在群众中选出一批收打能手树为标兵，然后组织标兵到各地巡回表演，把全体社员带动起来，掀起田间比武热潮。
    李渡公社田间比武一展开，就出现了快收快打的局面，随着工效节节上升，进度日日加快。乐丰大队三十名青年妇女分别组织成七姐妹、乐梨花、红霞、刘胡兰、花木兰等五个突击队，互相挑战比武。第一天，七姐妹队个个干劲十足，收打了三千斤稻谷，超过定额一倍多，名列第一。名落最后的乐梨花队急起直追，出工走在前面，收工走在后面，第二天收打了稻谷三千二百斤，夺得了比武第一名。全大队的社员见到她们火热比武，小伙子组织青年突击队，老农们组织黄忠队，老婆婆组织杨令婆队，小朋友组织罗成队，兵对兵、将对将，有的比快收，有的比快打，有的比多拾禾穗；掀起了热烈的比武竞赛，结果这个队的秋收进度第三天比第一天加快了一倍，第四天比第三天又加快了半倍多，全队四天结束了秋收，比原计划提前了六天。在比武的推动下，全社秋收工效平均每人每天收打稻谷三百六十多斤，比去年提高了30％，普遍超过了劳动定额。
    田间比武鼓舞了社员精收细打，使秋收质量大大提高。
    田间比武还迅速攻破了许多难关难卡，推动了秋收全面开展。有的稻田离村远，或泥深水多，收打任务艰巨；有的队人少田多，收打劳力不足，在这些地方开展起田间比武后，各种困难便一一突破了。鉴良大队第五小队秋收面积达一百三十亩，只有十一个劳力，任务大、劳力少，秋收进度落在各兄弟小队之后，全队需要半月才能完成秋收任务。大队党支部于是在这里举行了一场田间比武，从其他小队调来了三个花木兰队、四个武松队、五个罗成队，割的割、打的打、拾的拾，人多势众，赛的欢、干的猛，不到一天就帮助第五小队收完了全部晚稻。
    田间比武中，李渡公社各级党委还采取了许多措施保证比武竞赛持久开展。首先，坚持当场比武、当场评比、当场奖励。比武一般是紧张的劳动，根据紧张程度不同，确定比武每天只举行一次，每次一个上午或一个下午，或者大半天。每次比武结束后，立即在田间评比、奖励，这样只花十几分钟时间，社员结合进行了休息，又搞完了评奖，立即鼓舞了社员继续努力参加秋收。其次，及时总结、推广各种先进经验，扩大比武的成果。
