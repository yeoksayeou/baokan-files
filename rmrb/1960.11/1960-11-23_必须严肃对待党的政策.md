We in the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong were able to lead the Chinese revolution and construction from one victory to another, the fundamental key lies in the ability to use the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with the specific practice of China, in the various stages of the Chinese revolution, to formulate correct lines, policies, and guidelines, and to guide and organize the broad masses of people to unswervingly implement these lines, policies, and guidelines. Comrade Mao Zedong said:
  "Only when the Party's policies and tactics are all on the right track is there a possibility of victory for the Chinese revolution."
  (《Selected Works of Mao Zedong》, Volume Four, page 1296) This shows that the Party's policies are a powerful driving force for guiding and promoting the victorious advance of the revolutionary cause.

The Party's policies are a concentrated expression of revolutionary interests and a product of the combination of the Party's will and the will of the masses. The Party's policies stipulate the direction and norms of action for the entire Party and are the basis for connecting with the masses. Therefore, implementing the Party's policies actually guarantees the two fundamental issues of ensuring the Party's leadership and following the mass line. Any action of a revolutionary party is the implementation of policy. Therefore, the victory of all our work is inseparable from the correct implementation of the Party's policies.

Although the Party's policies are a weapon for guiding and promoting the cause of revolution and construction, even the best policies and tactics need people to implement them. The spirit of the policy must be conveyed to the masses through cadres, and resolutely organized for implementation and leading by example, so that the masses can act in accordance with the Party's policies. Therefore, conscientiously implementing the Party's policies is not only the duty of every revolutionary cadre, but also the minimum and necessary condition for every revolutionary cadre. As long as a revolutionary cadre firmly follows the Party's policies in what he thinks, says, and does, the effect of his work will inevitably be in line with the interests and demands of the broad masses of the people, and also in line with the interests of the Party and the country, thereby maximizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses and carrying out socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way. Our Party and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly emphasized the importance of seriously and earnestly treating the Party's policies, and its great significance lies here.

Whether one can seriously and earnestly treat the Party's policies is one of the main signs of measuring the organization and discipline of a revolutionary cadre. We know that the Party is a fighting organization, and it is impossible to achieve any combat victory without centralized and unified command. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "... certain states of indiscipline or anarchism, that is, arbitrarily revising the policies and tactics of the Central Committee or the higher party committees, implementing extremely harmful policies and tactics that they think are right and that violate unified will and unified discipline; under the pretext of busy work, adopting the wrong attitude of not asking for instructions beforehand and not reporting afterwards, regarding the places they manage as if they were independent countries. This state causes extremely great damage to the interests of the revolution." (《Selected Works of Mao Zedong》, Volume Four, pages 1333-1334) Comrade Mao Zedong's words, although spoken in 1948, should be remembered by every revolutionary cadre at all times. In this way, we can further strengthen our organization and discipline, thereby better implementing the Party's policies and ensuring the smooth development of the socialist construction cause.

Whether one can seriously treat the Party's policies is also a question of standpoint. We know that every revolutionary cadre is a servant of the people, and as a servant of the people, "we stand on the standpoint of the proletariat and the masses of the people. For a communist party member, it is also standing on the Party's standpoint, standing on the standpoint of Party spirit and Party policy." (《Selected Works of Mao Zedong》, Volume Three, page 850) Therefore, the issue of attitude towards the Party's policies is, for every party member, also an issue of Party spirit.

Emphasizing the seriousness of the Party's policies and requiring that things must be done in accordance with the Party's policies does not mean simply copying and transferring the Party's policies without thinking, without analysis, and mechanically applying them without regard to actual circumstances. If this is how it is understood, it is obviously wrong. It should be clear that the Party's policies are a profound reflection of the laws of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction, and their basic spirit and important practices are applicable to all aspects and must be resolutely implemented; otherwise, we will lose our direction and commit errors of principle. However, the universality of contradiction is contained in the particularity of contradiction. The same problem often has different forms of expression at different times, regions, and conditions, and therefore the methods of solving the problem should not be the same. Especially in a country as large as ours, with large regional differences and complex situations, we should be realistic. However, if we use this as an excuse, citing special circumstances, or excessively emphasizing flexibility, exaggerating the particular without implementing the Party's policies, or making choices based on our own subjective desires, with an attitude that is not resolute, that is also extremely harmful. The Party often teaches us that the principled nature of the Party's policies is unified with the flexibility in the implementation process. The flexibility in implementing policies aims to better combine the Party's policies with the actual situation of the region and department, implement the Party's policies in accordance with local conditions, and not violate the policies. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: "The Party's principles are the standard and measure of all policy and tactical changes. The Party's principled nature is the standard and measure of flexibility. For example, striving for the greatest interests of the greatest number of people is our unchanging principle, and this unchanging principle is the standard and measure for measuring whether all our policy and tactical changes are correct. All changes that conform to this principle are correct, and all changes that do not conform to this principle are incorrect." (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party")

To implement the Party's policies well, the primary prerequisite is to seriously study and research the Party's policies and be familiar with the Party's policies. However, some people, although they verbally acknowledge the importance of studying the Party's policies, are often unwilling to make the greatest determination to study diligently, lack serious thinking, and separate theory from practice, and have only a smattering of knowledge of the spirit and essence of the Party's policies, and cannot master them thoroughly. In this way, it will be limited to truly listen to the Party and resolutely and unreservedly implement the Party's policies. Therefore, in treating the Party's various policies, we must not only recognize their great significance and understand their spiritual essence, but more importantly, we must study the objective background of the policy's creation, understand the basis for the policy's formulation, what are the policy's basic starting point and the objectives to be achieved, and how to implement it in accordance with local conditions and times, and propose specific methods and measures for implementation, etc., and resolutely oppose the style of not conducting careful research, subjective conjecture, being flashy but impractical, and relying solely on personal enthusiasm and using one's own emotions to replace the Party's policies.

To implement the Party's policies well, it is also necessary to promptly and effectively check the implementation of the policies. The situation comes from the masses, and the policies are implemented through the masses. To understand the policies and master the policies, we must often go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, and conduct investigations and research. Through inspection, we can fully understand how the policies are being implemented in the work. What new creations and experiences do the masses have in implementing the policies, thereby enriching the content of our policies and improving the level of leadership. How do we understand and check whether the policies are being implemented correctly? Comrade Mao Zedong once gave us a profound exposition. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "... the quality and magnitude of the role played by all political parties' policies and their practices among the Chinese people ultimately depend on whether and to what extent they help the development of the productive forces of the Chinese people, and whether they are binding or liberating the productive forces." (《Selected Works of Mao Zedong》, Volume Three, page 1079) He also said: "All correct tasks, policies, and work styles are in line with the demands of the masses at that time and place, and are connected with the masses; all wrong tasks, policies, and work styles are not in line with the demands of the masses at that time and place, and are divorced from the masses." (《Selected Works of Mao Zedong》, Volume Three, page 1096) We should establish a firm policy perspective in our own work positions, often go deep into reality to understand the new problems that constantly arise in the implementation of the Party's policies, and promptly reflect to the higher levels the situation in the implementation of the Party's policies, and constantly improve our leadership thinking, style, and working methods.

### 必须严肃对待党的政策

    必须严肃对待党的政策
    我们党和毛泽东同志所以能够领导中国革命和建设从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，根本关键就在于善于运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国具体实践相结合，在我国革命的各个阶段，制定正确的路线、政策、方针，并引导和组织广大人民群众坚持不懈地贯彻实现这些路线、政策、方针。毛泽东同志说过：
  “只有党的政策和策略全部走上正轨，中国革命才有胜利的可能。”
  （《毛泽东选集》第四卷，1296页）这说明了党的政策，是指导和推进革命事业胜利前进的强大动力。
    党的政策，是革命利益的集中表现，是党的意志与群众意志相结合的产物。党的政策规定着全党行动的方向和准则，是联系群众的基础。因此，贯彻执行党的政策，实际上是保证党的领导和走群众路线这两个根本问题。一个革命政党的任何行动都是实行政策。所以，我们一切工作的胜利，都离不开正确地贯彻执行党的政策。
    党的政策虽然是指导和推动革命和建设事业的武器，但是，再好的政策，再好的策略，都是要人去执行的。政策精神要通过干部传达给群众，并坚决组织贯彻，带头执行，群众才能按照党的政策行动起来。因此，认真地贯彻执行党的政策，不仅是每个革命干部的义务，而且是每个革命干部起码的必要的条件。一个革命干部只要在自己所想、所说、所为中，坚决遵循党的政策，那么，工作的效果必然是既符合广大人民群众的利益和要求，又符合党和国家的利益，从而最大限度地调动广大群众的革命积极性，多快好省地进行社会主义建设。我们党和毛泽东同志一再强调要严肃认真地对待党的政策，其重大意义就在这里。
    能否严肃认真地对待党的政策，是衡量一个革命干部的组织性和纪律性的主要标志之一。我们知道，党是一个战斗的组织，没有集中统一的指挥，是不可能取得任何战斗胜利的。毛泽东同志曾经指出：“……某些无纪律状态或无政府状态，即擅自修改中央的或上级党委的政策和策略，执行他们自以为是的违背统一意志和统一纪律的极端有害的政策和策略；在工作繁忙的借口之下，采取事前不请示事后不报告的错误态度，将自己管理的地方，看成好像一个独立国。这种状态，给予革命利益的损害，极为巨大。”（《毛泽东选集》第四卷，第1333—1334页）毛泽东同志的这段话，虽然是1948年说的，但对于我们每一个革命干部来说，是任何时候都要记取的。这样，便可以进一步加强我们的组织性和纪律性，从而更好地贯彻执行党的政策，保证社会主义建设事业顺利发展。
    能否严肃对待党的政策，又是一个立场问题。我们知道，每个革命干部都是人民的勤务员，作为人民的勤务员，“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”（《毛泽东选集》第三卷，850页）所以，对待党的政策的态度问题，对于每个党员来说，又是党性问题。
    强调党的政策的严肃性，要求一定要按照党的政策办事，不等于对党的政策简单地照抄照转，不动脑筋，不加分析，不根据实际情况而机械地生搬硬套。如果这样去理解，那显然是错误的。应该明确，党的政策是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的规律性的深刻反映，其基本精神和重要的作法，对各方面都是适用的，必须坚决贯彻执行，否则，就会迷失方向，犯原则性的错误。但是，矛盾的普遍性是寓于矛盾的特殊性之中的，同样一个问题，在不同时间、地区和条件，往往有不同的表现形式，因而采取解决问题的方法也不应该千篇一律。特别像我们国家大，地区差别性也大，情况也较复杂，更应实事求是的对待。但是，如果因为这样，就借口情况特殊，或者过分强调灵活性，夸大特殊而不执行党的政策，或者以自己主观愿望决定取舍，七折八扣，态度不坚决，那也是极端有害的。党经常教导我们，党的政策的原则性同执行过程中的灵活性是统一的，执行政策的灵活性，其目的在于更好地把党的政策同本地区本部门的实际情况结合起来，因地制宜地贯彻执行党的政策，而不要违背政策。刘少奇同志说过：“党的原则，是一切政策与策略变动的标准和尺度。党的原则性，是灵活性的标准和尺度。比如，为最大多数人民的最大利益而奋斗，是我们一个不变的原则，这个不变的原则，是测量我们一切政策与策略变动是否正确的标准和尺度，一切合于这个原则的变动，都是正确的，一切不合这个原则的变动，都是不正确的。”（刘少奇：《论党》）
    要贯彻执行好党的政策，首要的前提是必须认真学习与研究党的政策，熟悉党的政策。但有一些人尽管在口头上承认学习党的政策的重要性，却往往不肯下最大决心刻苦钻研，缺乏认真思考，理论脱离实际，对党的政策精神实质，一知半解，不能融会贯通。这样，要真正做到听党的话，坚决地、不折不扣地贯彻执行党的政策，是会受到一定限制的。因此，我们对待党的各项政策，不仅要认识它的重大意义，领会其精神实质，而更重要的是要研究政策产生的客观背景，了解政策制定的依据，政策的基本出发点和要达到的目的是什么？又如何因地因时制宜地贯彻执行，提出贯彻执行的具体办法和措施，等等，坚决反对那种不认真研究，主观臆断，华而不实，单凭个人的热情，以自己的感情去代替党的政策的作风。
    要贯彻好党的政策，还要及时地切实地检查政策的执行情况。情况是从群众中来的，政策是通过群众执行的，要了解政策，掌握政策，就必须经常地深入实际，深入群众，调查研究。通过检查，才能充分了解政策在工作中是如何执行的。在执行政策中群众有那些新的创造和经验，从而丰富我们的政策内容，提高领导工作的水平。怎样了解和检查政策执行得是否正确呢？毛泽东同志曾经给我们作了深刻的阐明。毛泽东同志说：“……一切政党的政策及其实践在中国人民中所表现的作用的好坏、大小，归根到底，看它对于中国人民的生产力的发展是否有帮助及其帮助之大小，看它是束缚生产力的，还是解放生产力的。”（《毛泽东选集》第三卷，1079页）又说：“凡属正确的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求相适合，都是联系群众的；凡属错误的任务、政策和工作作风，都是和当时当地的群众要求不相适合，都是脱离群众的。”（《毛泽东选集》第三卷，1096页）我们应该在自己的工作岗位上，树立起坚强的政策观点，经常深入实际了解党的政策在执行中不断出现的新问题，并且及时地向上级反映党的政策在执行中的情况，不断改进我们的领导思想、作风和工作方法。
