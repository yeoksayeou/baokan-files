Reading the report about the Yimen Dining Hall in Yongquan Commune, Wuxiang County, Shanxi (see page 2 of this newspaper on the 20th), fills one with excitement. This year, the disaster situation here was severe, and the grain ration standard was not high. However, this dining hall ensured that people ate both their fill and well, and that it was done thriftily, making everyone satisfied and happy. This is a mirror for rural public dining halls, and all dining halls should strive to become like this.

The public dining hall is the center of the collective life of the commune and should be democratically managed by the people who eat there: offering opinions, suggesting ideas, setting rules, and mutually supervising implementation. Whether a dining hall can be run well ultimately depends on whether the branch and management personnel leading the dining hall earnestly rely on and mobilize the masses, and on whether the people who eat there wholeheartedly cherish the dining hall and have the enthusiasm to do everything possible to run the dining hall well.

The opinions of the people who eat at the dining hall must be collected by someone; the enthusiasm of the people who eat at the dining hall must be organized by someone; the experiences of the people who eat at the dining hall in managing their households thriftily and managing their lives well must be summarized and implemented in the work of the dining hall by someone. Who should bear this responsibility? This is the party organization leading the dining hall – the branch – and the administrator (manager) who manages the daily affairs of the dining hall under the leadership of the branch.

The Yimen Dining Hall is run well because the dining hall has plans, systems, and a foundation, and more importantly, because there are a group of good housekeepers in the dining hall. Everything is done by people, and without a group of housekeepers who devote all their energy to the dining hall, how could there be good plans, good systems, and a solid foundation?

"A hundred people have a hundred tastes." People easily have opinions about food, and there is often a distance between people's demands and reality. Many contradictions ultimately converge on the branch leading the dining hall, especially the administrator who manages the daily affairs of the dining hall. Why? Because they are "housekeepers," and they are responsible for "managing" everyone's "home" – food. As a result, some people feel that "it is difficult to get things done with many people," and are somewhat daunted by the glorious and important positions of administrator and cook. In fact, this is only seeing one side of the problem, and the secondary side, without seeing the main side of the problem. Why do people often have opinions about food? That is because they want to run the food well and want to eat more and better. There is strength in numbers, and there are many opinions with many people. As long as a manager acts according to everyone's opinions and organizes everyone's strength directly and indirectly into the work of the dining hall, any difficulties can be overcome, and any opinions can be easily clarified.

Dining hall management personnel should be fair, capable, caring, and considerate people, and first of all, they should be people who love the cause of the public dining hall. Managing the most important issue of eating for dozens or hundreds of people, isn't this a very important and great burden? With the same amount of things in my hands, to make everyone eat more and save more, isn't this work both difficult and glorious? The Yimen Dining Hall has a group of people who wholeheartedly love their careers, such as branch secretary Li Guozhong, who regards the dining hall as his "base" (there are two other "bases," one is the office, and the other is the farmland), "whether day or night, as soon as he has nothing to do, he is with the cooks, firing, cutting vegetables, carrying water, rolling noodles, doing whatever he encounters." When doing work, he regards the dining hall as his own home, using all his energy to manage it; when eating, he strictly follows the rules, insisting on eating with the masses and eating the same food, "not eating an extra grain of rice, not drinking an extra sip of soup." If every dining hall has one or several such management personnel, what worries are there that the dining hall cannot be run well!

The responsibility that the broad masses of commune members entrust to the administrators is very heavy, and the power given to them is also very great. An excellent administrator should care for and consider each person who eats there, just like the head of a family cares for and considers his family members. People's life needs have "minor differences" within "major similarities." People's life order has "abnormalities" within "normality." A public dining hall administrator who not only pays attention to people's "major similarities" and "normality" with his main strength, but also takes care of people's "minor differences" and "abnormalities" with considerable strength, his work level is one step higher than others. This newspaper published on November 14: When Typhoon ravaged the Jinjiang County Cizao Commune Shao厝 Production Team Dining Hall in Fujian this summer and commune members rushed to harvest early rice all night, they carefully cooked rice and delivered it to the fields in the wind and rain; during the busy summer harvest and summer planting season, in order to let commune members eat better, they ground rice into flour, rubbed it into small balls, and made sweet glutinous rice ball soup for commune members as snacks; some old, weak, and disabled commune members could not go to the dining hall to eat, so they delivered the food to these commune members' homes. Our goal is to run the dining hall not only so that commune members feel that their lives are guaranteed, but also so that commune members feel that their lives are very convenient and feel the infinite warmth of the socialist family. This is a truly first-class dining hall.

The Yimen Dining Hall has four cooks. People praised them and said: "Zhang Meimei is fair, Dong Runxiang is loyal and reliable, Zhang Gengxiu is efficient, and Hao Lanlan is hardworking." Glorious comments, mass identification! These are the noble qualities of the working people, excellent work styles that should be greatly promoted, and the standards for dining hall administrators and cooks. The leaders of every dining hall should select staff according to these standards; "politics to the dining hall, cadres to the kitchen" is to implement the Party's series of policies and guidelines on arranging people's lives and running public dining halls well, and also to discover, select and train such staff. Such staff are the bridge between commune members and the dining hall. The masses trust them, care for them, and in turn care for and participate in the work of the dining hall. Just as Ren Changda, the manager of the Yimen Dining Hall, said: "In the past, I was the only one who worried about running the dining hall; now everyone worries about running the dining hall."

What are the class backgrounds of the four cooks? Poor peasants. This is certainly not an accidental coincidence, nor is it to say that the staff of the dining hall must be composed of pure poor peasants. However, fairness, loyalty, hard work, and efficiency are the excellent qualities of poor peasants. Not to mention landlords and rich peasants, even ordinary well-to-do peasants do not possess so many excellent qualities. It is no accident that the Yimen Dining Hall is in the hands of poor peasants, under the leadership of the Party branch secretary and the manager (Party branch member), and is run with great success, becoming a red flag in the whole county. Poor peasants were the people who suffered the most and were oppressed the most in the old society. According to typical surveys in Hebei, Shanxi and other provinces, before liberation, poor peasants consumed an average of about 150 jin of grain per person per year; in years of disaster, this number was far from being reached. Their economic status determines their revolutionary firmness, determines their wholehearted support for the people's communes, support for the public dining halls, and support for all collective undertakings. From their own personal experience, they fully realize that the people's communes and the public dining halls are the backing for their happy lives. Compared with the past, their lives in the public dining hall are not only greatly guaranteed, but also much better. Rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, unite with the middle peasants - in all rural work, we must implement the Party's class policy, and we must implement the Party's class policy even more in running public dining halls well.

### 从义门食堂里学到什么？

    从义门食堂里学到什么？
    读了山西武乡县涌泉公社义门食堂的报道（见20日本报第二版），使人万分兴奋。这里今年灾情严重，留粮标准不高。可是，这个食堂保证了人们吃得又饱、又好、又省，人人满意，皆大欢喜。这是农村公共食堂的一面镜子，所有食堂都应该力争办成这个样子。
    公共食堂是公社集体生活的中心，应该由入伙的人民主管理：提意见，出主意，定制度，互相监督贯彻执行。食堂能不能办好，归根到底，看领导食堂的支部和管理人员是不是认真依靠群众、发动群众，看入伙的人是不是全心全意爱护食堂，有没有千方百计把食堂办好的积极性。
    入伙的人们对食堂的意见，要有人集中起来；入伙的人们对食堂的积极性，要有人组织起来；入伙的人们的勤俭持家、管好生活的经验，要有人总结起来和贯彻到食堂工作中去。谁来担负这个责任？这就是领导食堂的党组织——支部和在支部领导下管理食堂日常事务的管理员（事务长）。
    义门食堂办得好，是因为食堂有计划，有制度，有家底，更重要的是食堂里有一批好管家。事情都是人作的，如果没有一批把自己的全部心血倾注到食堂里的管家人，哪能出现好的计划、好的制度和雄厚的家底呢？
    “百人吃百味。”人们对于伙食很容易有意见，人们的要求和现实常常有个距离，这就是矛盾。许许多多的矛盾，最后总是集中到领导食堂的支部，特别是管理食堂日常事务的管理员身上。为什么？因为他们是“管家人”，他们负责任“管”着大家的“家”——伙食。于是，有些人觉得“人多难办事”，对管理员、炊事员这种很光荣、很重要的岗位，竟有些望而生畏起来。其实，这是只看到了问题的一面，并且是次要的一面，而没有看到问题的主要的一面。人们为什么常常对伙食有意见？那是想把伙食办好，想吃得更饱更好。人多力量大，人多议论多。一个管理人员，只要按照大家的议论办事，把大家的力量直接间接地组织到食堂工作中来，什么困难都能克服，什么意见也都不难说清楚。
    食堂的管理人员，应该是公道、能干、肯关心人、会体贴人的人，首先，应该是热爱公共食堂这个事业的人。把几十个人、几百个人最重要的吃饭问题管起来，这个担子不是极重要、极伟大的么？同样多的东西，放在我的手里，要使大家吃得更饱、更省，这工作不是既艰巨又光荣的么？义门食堂有一批全心全意热爱自己事业的人，像支部书记李国忠，把食堂作为自己的“据点”（另有两个“据点”，一个是办公室，一个是庄稼地），“不论白天黑夜，一没事就和炊事员在一块，烧火、切菜、担水、擀面，遇着什么干什么。”在做工作的时候，把食堂看作自己的家，用自己的全副精力来经营它；在吃饭的时候，却又是严格按制度办事，坚持和群众一同吃饭、吃一样的饭，“米不多吃一颗，汤不多喝一口。”如果每一个食堂都有一个或者几个这样的管理人员，何愁食堂不能办好！
    广大社员交给管理员的责任是很重的，付给他们的权力也是很大的。一个优秀的管理员，应该像一个家庭的当家人关心、体贴自己的家庭成员那样，关心、体贴每一个入伙的人。人们的生活需要，在“大同”之中有“小异”。人们的生活秩序，在“通常”之中有“异常”。一个公共食堂管理员，他如果不只以主要力量注意人们的“大同”和“通常”，而且以相当的力量照顾人们的“小异”和“异常”，他的工作水平就比别人高了一步。本报11月14日刊载：福建晋江县磁灶公社烧厝生产队食堂的工作人员，在今年夏季台风肆虐，社员连夜抢收早稻的时候，他们精心作饭，冒着风雨送到田间；在夏收夏种大忙时候，他们为了让社员吃得更好，把大米磨成粉，搓成小团，做成甜子汤给社员当点心；有些老弱残病的社员不能到食堂吃饭，他们就把饭送到这些社员家里。我们的目标是把食堂办得不只使社员感觉生活有保证，而且使社员感觉生活很方便，感到社会主义大家庭的无限温暖，这才是真正第一流的食堂。
    义门食堂有四个炊事员。人们称赞她们说：“张梅梅为人公道，董润香忠实可靠，张更秀办事利落，郝兰兰吃苦耐劳。”光荣的评语，群众的鉴定！这是劳动人民的崇高品质、应该大加提倡的优良作风，食堂管理员、炊事员的标准。每一个食堂的领导人都应该按照这样的标准选择工作人员；“政治到食堂，干部下伙房”，是为了贯彻执行党的关于安排人民生活、办好公共食堂的一系列方针政策，也是为了发现、选择和培养这样的工作人员。这样的工作人员是社员和食堂中间的桥梁，群众信任他们，爱护他们，进而关心和参加食堂的工作。正像义门食堂事务长任长大所说的：“过去办食堂，操心的就我一个人；如今办食堂，大家都操心。”
    四个炊事员都是什么成份？贫农。这当然不是一种偶然的巧合，也不是说食堂的工作人员必须由清一色的贫农来担任。但是，公道、忠实、吃苦耐劳、办事利落，这是贫苦农民的优良品质，这里不说地主、富农，就是一般富裕农民，也不具备这许多优良品质。义门食堂掌握在贫农手中，在党的支部书记和事务长（党支部委员）领导下，办得有声有色，成为全县的红旗，不是偶然的。贫农，在旧社会是受苦最深、受压迫最重的人。据河北、山西等省的典型调查，在解放以前，贫农每人每年平均消费粮食一百五十斤左右；遇到灾荒年，这个数字就远远达不到了。他们的经济地位决定了他们的革命坚定性，决定了他们全心全意拥护人民公社，拥护公共食堂，拥护一切集体事业。他们从自己的切身体验中，充分认识到人民公社和公共食堂是自己幸福生活的靠山，他们在公共食堂的生活，和过去比较起来，不仅大有保证，而且好得多了。依靠贫雇农，团结中农——在一切农村工作中，都要贯彻党的阶级政策，办好公共食堂更要贯彻党的阶级政策。
