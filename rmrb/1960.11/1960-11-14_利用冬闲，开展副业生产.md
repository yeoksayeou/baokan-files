Editorial: Utilize Winter Leisure to Develop Sideline Production

    Today's People's Daily publishes a report on the vigorous development of winter sideline production in Maolu Commune, Jintan County, Jiangsu Province. It raises two fundamental issues regarding sideline production: first, who should engage in sideline production, which concerns the management system of sideline production; second, how much effort should be put into sideline production, which concerns the allocation of labor. Maolu Commune appropriately resolved these two issues, and sideline production has developed by leaps and bounds.

    The output value of rural sideline occupations has always accounted for a considerable proportion of the total agricultural output value. Sideline production is an important production sector for promoting agricultural production and improving people's lives. This winter, the labor force used for farmland capital construction, such as water conservancy projects and land leveling, will be much smaller than in the previous two years, and the labor force used for agricultural production and sideline production will greatly increase. People's communes in rural areas should take advantage of the winter slack season to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of production teams, production brigades, and the broad masses of commune members, so that our country's rural sideline production—both collectively managed sideline production and commune members' household sideline production—can achieve even greater development.

    Sideline production is relative to "primary production" such as farming and animal husbandry. The characteristics of sideline production are numerous projects, with many projects being small-scale and dispersed, possessing the broadest mass character. This shows that sideline production should be comprehensively planned and uniformly arranged, but the management method should not be excessively centralized. Maolu Commune stipulates that, in the commune's sideline production, except for a few large-scale sideline occupations managed by the commune and production teams (basic accounting units), the majority are contracted to the production brigades or assigned to the production brigades for management; a portion of the small-scale, sporadic sideline occupations with less labor input are managed by commune member households. This approach is in line with the Party's policy and the characteristics of sideline production. At the current stage, the people's commune implements a three-level ownership system based on the production team. Therefore, rural sideline occupations should be mainly managed by production teams. The so-called "mainly managed by production teams" does not mean withdrawing labor from the production brigades and directly managing sideline production by the production team, but rather the production team uniformly arranges and contracts certain tasks to the production brigades. Why contract it to the production brigade? Because the production brigade is the basic unit for organizing production, it can better integrate sideline production with agricultural production, rationally arrange winter agricultural production and sideline production, so as to promote each other and not delay either. Why should the commune carry out comprehensive planning and the production team make unified arrangements? Because sideline production is not isolated, but closely related to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, especially promoting and being determined by agricultural production. If comprehensive planning and unified arrangements are not implemented, there may be a phenomenon of neglecting sideline occupations while focusing on developing agriculture, or excessively emphasizing sideline occupations and harming agriculture, which is detrimental to both agriculture and sideline occupations.

    Comprehensive planning must first plan the rational deployment of labor, and unified arrangements must first arrange the scientific allocation of labor. Labor is the main factor of production. Although the task of farmland capital construction is smaller this winter, if the labor allocation problem cannot be well resolved while implementing the principle of combining work and rest, various tasks cannot be completed simultaneously. Maolu Commune has a total of 7,500 laborers. They use 50% for field management and manure accumulation, about 8% for small-scale water conservancy and reservoir supporting projects, more than 5% for vegetable cultivation, 4% for collective living welfare, and 32% for winter sideline occupations. Their labor force was originally insufficient, but the problem was solved by adopting methods such as concentrated use of forces, flexible arrangement of labor and time, improved operation methods, and reformed tools. The situation in different regions is different, and the proportion of labor allocation cannot be exactly the same, but their approach of ensuring key points while taking care of all aspects is worth learning for every commune.

    Under the principle of not hindering collective production and collective labor, the masses should be widely mobilized to develop household sideline occupations during the winter slack season, and the income should belong entirely to the commune members. Many types of sideline production have the characteristics of being small and dispersed, requiring widespread participation of commune members; many commune members have family craftsmanship, and fully exerting their enthusiasm and technical expertise can increase commune members' income, greatly increase the variety of sideline products, and enable the broad masses of urban and rural people to obtain more daily necessities and production supplies. Many sideline production projects, such as handicrafts like weaving, embroidery, weaving straw hat braids, weaving reed mats, as well as the processing of certain agricultural and sideline products, are suitable for family management and should be greatly promoted for these indoor production sideline projects.

    Winter rural sideline production is mainly managed by production teams, while mobilizing the broad masses to participate, and communes generally do not directly manage it. Does this mean that commune leaders can ignore this matter and completely let the production teams, production brigades, and commune members do it themselves? Of course, that is not the meaning. On the one hand, for some large-scale sideline occupations that the production team is unable to manage, the commune should still directly manage them; on the other hand, and most importantly, the commune should effectively lead the sideline production of the production teams, production brigades, and even individual commune members. This means not only paying attention to helping cadres resolutely implement policies, but also solving various specific problems related to sideline production, such as reasonably dividing the activity areas or scopes of each production team, organizing the supply of raw materials, organizing product sales, strengthening technical guidance, and so on; at the same time, correctly resolving the relationship between winter sideline production and other production work (such as field management of overwintering crops, short-distance transportation), so that sideline production closely cooperates with winter agricultural production; it is also necessary to conscientiously implement the principle of combining work and rest, so that the broad masses of commune members have spare time to manage a certain amount of household sideline occupations.

    Most sideline production is commodity production, and communes, production teams, production brigades, and the broad masses of commune members mainly produce for the purpose of selling goods and increasing income. Financial and trade departments and transportation departments at all levels should actively support rural sideline production. Financial and trade departments should directly link up with production teams based on market needs and specific conditions such as local raw materials, technology, and management habits, sign production and sales contracts, do a good job in procurement, and help solve the supply of materials and technical problems in sideline production. Transportation departments should arrange transportation work well, ensuring that the large number of sideline products produced by production teams and commune members are transported out in a timely manner, and that the means of production and means of livelihood they need are transported in a timely manner. This is a major event for various departments to support agricultural production this winter, and they must strive to do it well.

    Sideline production is an important component of China's rural economy, and this year's winter rural sideline production has new significance. The people's communes and the broad masses of commune members across the country are working hard to strive for a greater summer harvest and a greater full-year harvest next year than in any previous year. Doing a good job in this winter's sideline production can greatly increase the income of commune members and production teams, and greatly increase the strength to strive for a greater agricultural harvest next year. This is a major matter related to more than 500 million peasants, and a major matter related to agricultural production next year. Party organizations at all levels must earnestly strengthen their leadership over this work, so that this winter's rural sideline production becomes more prosperous and flourishing.

### 利用冬闲，开展副业生产

    利用冬闲，开展副业生产
    本报今天发表的江苏金坛县茅麓公社大搞冬季副业生产的消息，提出了关于副业生产的两个根本性的问题：第一，由谁来搞副业，也就是经营副业的体制问题；第二，用多大力量搞副业，也就是劳动力的安排问题。茅麓公社恰当地解决了这两个问题，副业生产就大踏步发展起来了。
    农村副业的产值，在农业生产总产值中，一向占有相当大的比重；副业生产是推进农业生产，改善人民生活的一个重要生产部门。今年冬季，农村中用于兴修水利、平整土地等农田基本建设的劳动力，比较前两年要少得多，用于农业生产和副业生产的劳动力就会大大增加。各地农村人民公社应该利用冬闲时间，充分发挥生产队、生产小队和广大社员的积极性，使我国的农村副业生产——无论是集体经营的副业生产，还是社员的家庭副业生产，有一个更大的发展。
    副业生产，是与种植业、畜牧业等“正业生产”相对而言的。副业生产的特点是项目众多，很多项目的生产规模小而分散，具有最广泛的群众性。这就说明，副业生产应该全面规划，统一安排，但在经营方式上又不能过分集中。茅麓公社规定，全社的副业生产，除了少数公社和生产队（基本核算单位）经营的大型副业以外，多数由生产大队包给生产小队经营，或者划归生产小队经营；一部分用劳力不多的零星副业，由社员家庭经营。这种作法是符合党的政策和副业生产的特点的。在现阶段，人民公社实行队为基础的三级所有制，因此，农村副业要以生产队经营为主。所谓以生产队经营为主，并不是说把劳动力从生产小队抽出来，由生产队直接经营副业生产，而是由生产队统一安排，包给生产小队一定的任务。为什么要包给生产小队经营？因为生产小队是组织生产的基层单位，它接受了副业生产任务，可以更好地同农业生产密切结合，合理地安排冬季农业生产和副业生产，作到互相促进，两不耽误。为什么要由公社全面规划、由生产队统一安排？因为副业生产不是孤立的，而是和农、林、牧、渔各业生产密切相关，特别是促进农业生产和为农业生产所决定的。如果不实行全面规划和统一安排，就可能出现只顾发展农业而挤掉了副业，或者过分强调副业而损害了农业的现象，对农业、副业都是不利的。
    全面规划首先要规划劳动力的合理部署，统一安排首先要安排劳动力的科学调配。劳动力是生产力的主要因素。今年冬季农田基本建设任务虽然较小，但在贯彻实现劳逸结合的原则下，劳动力调配问题如果不能很好地解决，各种任务还是不能同时完成的。茅麓公社共有七千五百个劳动力。他们以50％搞田间管理和积肥，以约8％搞小型水利和水库配套工程，以5％以上种蔬菜，以4％搞集体生活福利，以32％搞冬季副业。他们的劳动力原是不够的，但由于采取了集中使用兵力、灵活安排劳力和时间、改进操作方法和改革工具等办法，问题也就解决了。各地情况不同，安排劳力的比例当然不能完全一样，但是，他们这种保证重点而又全面照顾的作法，各个公社都值得学习。
    在不妨碍集体生产和集体劳动的原则下，应该广泛地动员群众利用冬闲时间发展家庭副业，收入完全归社员所有。许多种副业生产具有细小、分散的特点，需要广泛吸收社员参加；许多社员都有家传手艺，充分发挥他们的积极性和技术特长，可以增加社员收入，大大增多副业产品的品种，使广大城乡人民获得更多的生活用品和生产用品。许多副业生产项目如编织、刺绣、编草帽辫、织苇席等手工业，以及若干农副产品加工等等，都适合家庭经营的，应该大大提倡这些室内生产的副业项目。
    冬季农村副业生产以生产队经营为主，同时发动广大群众参加，公社一般不直接经营，这是不是说，公社领导者就可以不管这件事情，完全由生产队、生产小队和社员自己去搞呢？当然不是这个意思。一方面，有些规模大、生产队无力经营的副业，公社还是应该直接经营；另一方面，也是最重要的方面，公社应该切实把生产队、生产小队以至社员个人的副业生产领导好。这就是说，不只要注意帮助干部坚决贯彻政策，而且还要解决好有关副业生产的各种具体问题，比如合理划分各个生产队活动的区域或范围，组织原材料的供应，组织产品推销，加强技术指导，等等；同时正确地解决冬季副业生产同其他生产工作（比如越冬作物田间管理、短途运输）的关系，使副业生产密切配合冬季农业生产；还要认真贯彻劳逸结合的原则，广大社员才有业余时间经营一定数量的家庭副业。
    副业生产多数是商品生产，公社、生产队、生产小队和广大社员主要是为了出售商品、增加收入而生产的。各级财贸部门和交通运输部门要积极支持农村副业生产。财贸部门要根据市场的需要和当地原料、技术、经营习惯等具体条件，同生产队直接挂钩，订立产销合同，作好收购工作，帮助解决副业生产中的物资供应和技术问题。运输部门要把调运工作安排好，保证把生产队和社员生产的大量副业产品及时运出来，把他们需要的生产资料和生活资料及时运进去。这是各个部门今年冬季支援农业生产的一件大事，一定要努力作好。
    副业生产是我国农村经济的一个重要组成部分，今年的冬季农村副业生产，更有新的意义。全国农村人民公社和广大社员，正在为争取明年获得比以往任何一年更大的夏季丰收和全年更大丰收而努力。搞好了今年冬季的副业生产，就可以大大增加社员和生产队的收入，大大增加争取明年农业更大丰收的力量。这是关系五亿多农民的大事情，是关系明年农业生产的大事情，各地党组织要认真加强对这一工作的领导，使今年冬季农村副业生产搞得更兴旺更繁荣。
