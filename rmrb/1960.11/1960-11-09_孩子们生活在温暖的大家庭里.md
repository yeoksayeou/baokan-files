　　Making Winter Clothes

　　The weather in Beijing is gradually turning cold. In the nursery organization service station of the Da Shi Lan'r People's Commune, more than a dozen women are busy. Some are dismantling and washing cotton clothes and bedding, and some are tirelessly making winter clothes on sewing machines. Just like preparing for winter for their own children, they are busily preparing winter bedding and clothing for the children in the nursery organization.

　　This children's service station is busy all day long. It has dismantling, washing, and mending groups, children's shoe groups, food processing groups, etc., and sells children's toys and general merchandise, serving more than a thousand children in more than twenty kindergartens, nurseries, and breastfeeding rooms in the commune. As winter is approaching, they concentrate their efforts on dismantling, washing, and mending services, and rush to make winter clothes for the children. There are not many staff, but the competition is very lively. Everyone wrote a letter of determination, guaranteeing to complete the task of making cotton clothes and quilts for the children with quality, quantity, and on time, so that the children's mothers can participate in production with peace of mind. In October, they dismantled and washed more than 3,000 pieces of clothing and bedding for the children, and made more than 100 new cotton clothes and coats, all of which were satisfactory to parents and childcare workers. One afternoon, Zhang Jieru, who works in the Southeast Yuan Breastfeeding Room, came to the service station to thank the service staff for making eight cotton clothes for their four children in a timely manner. She said that she must work hard to repay the Party and Chairman Mao for leading them to establish urban people's communes and bringing such benefits.

　　Protecting Health

　　Hearing that a child in the nearby neighborhood had a high temperature, the director and health worker of the Cheng'en Temple Nursery of the Er Long Lu People's Commune hurried to each class to tell all the childcare workers to be more vigilant and take extra precautions to ensure that the children spend this winter in good health. The next day, the childcare workers held a special competition meeting to ensure that the children would spend the winter in good health.

　　These "Red Flag Nursery" aunties, who have been rated as such in Beijing, have never relaxed their efforts for the health of the children. Winter is the season when children are prone to measles, so they studied the knowledge of measles prevention as early as the beginning of September and conducted a survey of children who had not had measles. Da Qing, who is over three years old, had red spots on his body one year, and his parents thought he had already had measles. The health worker and childcare worker were not at ease, so they carefully investigated and proved that it was not measles. Now, Da Qing and other susceptible children who have not had measles have red cloth flowers as a symbol on their shoulders, so that the aunties can observe the children's health at any time. Since then, all the susceptible children in the institute have taken measles prevention medicine three times. Now, the whole institute has followed the needs of winter health care, insisting on taking the children's temperature in the morning, noon, and evening, opening the windows before getting up, and sunbathing in the morning and afternoon...

　　Thanks to the efforts of all the childcare workers in the institute, no infectious diseases have occurred in the institute for more than a year, and there are very few children with runny noses or coughs.

　　Lighting the Stove at Night

　　After dinner, most of the staff of the Shijia Hutong Nursery of the Chaoyangmen People's Commune, except for the childcare workers on duty, like to squeeze into a small office to listen to radio broadcasts of opera programs, childcare knowledge lectures, current affairs... This time, just after turning on the radio, they heard the weather forecast, saying that the temperature would drop sharply at night, with freezing and strong winds.

　　Like receiving a mobilization order, the childcare workers immediately connected it with their own work:

　　"The babies in our class are so little, they will freeze if it's so cold!" said the auntie in the infant class anxiously.

　　"It's only mid-October, and the weather is so cold. The children's cotton clothes, etc., have been prepared long ago, and only the stove has not been installed," said Pan Yue'e, the director of the institute.

　　"Let's install it now! We can light a fire if it's too cold at night," the childcare workers suggested in unison.

　　At this time, it was already past 7 pm, and all the children in the institute were asleep. All the staff of the institute—the director, childcare workers, and cooks—forgot the fatigue of a day's work, and moved the stove and chimney, which had been cleaned and intact, from the storage room, and installed them beside the children lightly and quietly until midnight before going back to rest.

　　In the second half of the night, the temperature dropped sharply, and the aunties in the infant class and small class lit the first heating fire of the year for the children.

### 孩子们生活在温暖的大家庭里

    孩子们生活在温暖的大家庭里
    赶制冬服
    北京的气候逐渐转寒。大栅栏人民公社托儿组织服务站里，十多个妇女忙个不停，有的在拆洗棉衣和被褥，有的在缝纫机上不停地赶制冬装。她们就像给自己的孩子准备过冬一样，在紧张地为托儿组织的孩子们准备过冬的被服和衣裳。
    这个儿童服务站，整天都在忙碌。这里设有拆洗缝补组，童鞋组，食品加工组等等，并代售儿童用的玩具百货，为公社二十多个幼儿园、托儿所和哺乳室的一千多个孩子服务。冬天快要到了，她们就集中力量开展拆洗缝补业务，为孩子们赶做冬装。工作人员不多，竞赛可热闹得很，人人写了决心书，保证按质按量按时完成给孩子做棉衣棉被的任务，让孩子们的妈妈安心参加生产。在10月里，她们就为儿童们拆洗了三千多件衣服和被褥，赶做出一百多件新棉衣和外衣，件件活都做到家长和保育员满意。一天下午，在东南园哺乳室工作的张杰如特意来到服务站，感谢服务人员给她们四个孩子及时做出八件棉衣。她表示一定要好好工作，报答党和毛主席领导她们成立城市人民公社带来这样的好处。
    保护健康
    听说附近街坊有一个孩子体温较高，二龙路人民公社承恩寺托儿所所长、保健员赶忙到各个班把消息告诉全体保育员，要大家更加提高警惕，加意防范，让孩子们健康地度过这个冬季。第二天，保育员们又专门举行了竞赛大会，保证孩子们健康地度过冬季。
    这个被评为北京市红旗托儿所的阿姨们，从来就没有为孩子们的健康放松过努力。冬季是儿童易患麻疹的季节，她们早在9月初就学习了预防麻疹的知识，对没有患过麻疹的孩子都作了调查。三岁多的大清，有一年身上曾经出过红斑点，家长以为他已患过麻疹了。保健员和保育员不放心，就认真进行调查，证明那不是麻疹。现在，大清和其他一些没有患过麻疹的易感儿，肩上都佩上了作为标志的红布花，以便阿姨们随时观察孩子的健康状况。从那时以来，全所的易感儿都已服了三次预防麻疹的药水。现在全所已按照冬季卫生保健的需要，坚持早、中、晚给孩子试体温，起床前先开窗子，上下午晒太阳……。
    由于全所保育人员的努力，这个所已经一年多没有发生过传染病，流鼻涕、咳嗽的孩子也非常少。
    夜安火炉
    吃完晚饭，朝阳门人民公社史家胡同托儿所除了值班的保育员以外，其余的大部分人，都喜欢挤在一间小小的办公室里，听收音机广播戏曲节目、保育知识讲座、时事……。这一次，刚刚打开收音机不一会儿，就听到气象预报，说晚上气温要大降，有冰冻、大风。
    像接到一个动员令一样，保育员们立即和自己的工作联系起来：
    “我们班上的婴儿都那么一点点，这么冷可会冻坏的！”乳儿班的阿姨焦心地说。
    “才10月中旬，天气就这样冷了，孩子们的棉衣等等早备好了，就差炉子没有安上。”所长潘月娥接着说。
    “咱们现在就动手安装吧！晚上要是冷得不行可以生上火。”保育员们齐声建议。
    这时，已是下午七点多钟，全所孩子都已熟睡了，全所的工作人员——所长、保育员、炊事员，忘掉了一天工作的疲累，从储藏室里搬出了早已收拾干净完整的炉子、烟筒，轻手轻脚、细声细气地在孩子们的身旁安装，直到半夜才回去休息。
    后半夜，气温急剧降低，乳儿班、小班的阿姨就为孩子们点上了今年第一炉取暖的火。
