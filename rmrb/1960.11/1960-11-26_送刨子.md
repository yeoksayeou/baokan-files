    Sending a Plane
    Ni Zhiji, Zhejiang Provincial Construction Bureau Timber Products Prefabrication Factory

    Lately, the old man has been getting up early and rushing to the factory. And in the evening? He doesn't come home until late at night. It's no hardship waiting for him every night, but opening and closing the door disturbs the neighbors' sleep, which makes me a bit embarrassed.

    This day, like usual, I came back after getting soy milk, and he was nowhere to be seen. I went into the inner room and suddenly saw the old man's redwood plane, still standing upright on the table, its blackish-red shell gleaming, its square mouth open as if pleading with me that its master had abandoned it. Indeed! How could he forget to take it with him? What's the use of going to the factory empty-handed? Isn't that just getting up early for nothing? I thought, he'll definitely come back to get it when he realizes he forgot the plane, so I might as well take it to him and save him the trip, and he can save some time to plane a few more doors and windows. So I put the plane in my woven handbag and hurried along the road the old man takes every day towards the factory.

    Stepping through the gate, I told the gatekeeper, Old Pan, that I needed to see the old man urgently, and he accompanied me to find him. When we got to the workshop, the old man spotted me first and came to meet me.

    "What are you doing here?" His opening question seemed to blame me for coming, as if he hadn't even thought about forgetting the plane.

    "I came to bring you the plane." As I said this, I took the plane out and gave it to him.

    "Oh! We don't use this thing anymore!" He seemed amused, as if he couldn't quite explain what was going on.

    "What? Have you been transferred to a different job?" I was completely confused.

    "Oh my! I thought it was something urgent, it turns out you're bringing the plane to Master Wang. Haha, I say, you model family member are too unconcerned with what's going on at the factory!" Old Pan's words made me even more bewildered. What on earth was going on?

    Later, Old Pan helped me solve the mystery. It turned out that this group of old brothers in the assembly workshop, under the leadership and support of the Party, had successfully created an automatic planing machine for doors and windows, and from then on, they no longer needed to use this hand plane. Hearing this news, I was so happy that tears welled up in my eyes, and at the same time, it stirred up bitter memories: this plane was the only legacy of my father, and also his master. It tortured my father along with the exploiting class for his whole life. Before he died, he said to his son-in-law: "I leave my daughter and the plane to you." After that, the old man, like my father, was worn out and became a hunchback before he was even forty. After liberation, we began to live a happy life in our later years. He entered the factory and had a fixed workplace. The working conditions were much better, and the work efficiency was many times higher than before liberation. But the plane was still like an iron chain, locking the workers' hands and feet, and no matter how hard they worked, they still couldn't meet the needs of the rapidly developing construction industry.

    "We can stand up straight and work comfortably now. The country wants to build as many houses as possible, and we will supply as many doors and windows as needed," he said, pointing this way and that as he introduced the situation to me.

    When he saw tears on my happy face, he handed me a towel, and then took the plane and said in his usual loud voice: "Okay! Let's give it to the Party and leave it to future generations, so they can see what their ancestors used to work with!"

    Instantly, a burst of gongs and drums sounded, and I joined the good news reporting team, wiped away my tears, and happily ran towards the factory Party committee's office building.

    送刨子
    浙江省建筑厅木材成品预制厂  倪志集
    近来，老头子总是清早起来，就急匆匆地往厂里跑。晚上呢？深更半夜才回家。我每晚等他回来，辛苦倒没啥，可是开门闭户的闹得邻舍睡不安稳，真有点不好意思。
    这天，同往常一样，等我打了豆浆回来，又不见他的影子了。我走进内房，忽然看见老头子那把红木刨子，还笔挺挺地摆在桌子上，黑里透红的刨壳，发出闪闪的亮光，张着方方的大口，好像在向我哀告，主人抛弃了它。是呀！怎么好忘记把它带去呢？空着手进厂有啥用，这不是白起个大清早吗？我想，等他发现没带刨子一定要回来拿的，还不如给他送去，免得他多走这趟冤枉路，节约点时间也可以多刨几扇门窗。于是我就将刨子放进手提草包，沿着老头子每天要走的那条路，急步奔向工厂。
    跨进大门，我告诉传达员老潘，有要紧事找老头子，他就陪我去找了。来到车间，老头子眼明先看到我，就迎上来了。
    “你来干什么？”劈头这一问似乎怪我来错了，看他完全没想到忘记带刨子。
    “给你送刨子来的。”说着我拿出刨子给他。
    “哎呀！如今不用这东西啦！”他觉得好笑，好像又一时讲不清这是怎么回事。
    “怎么你调工作改行啦？”我丈二和尚摸不着头脑。
    “哦哟！我当啥要紧事，原来是给王师傅送刨子来的。哈哈、哈，我说你这家属模范也太不关心厂里的事啦！”传达员老潘这一说，就更叫我莫名其妙了，这到底是怎么回事呀！
    后来还是老潘帮我解了这个谜，原来是他们装配工段的这班老兄弟，在党的领导和支持下，创造成功一台自动刨门窗联合机，从此就不再用这手工刨子了。听到这消息，我高兴得流下泪来，同时也勾起辛酸的回忆：这刨子是我父亲，也是他师傅的唯一遗产。它和剥削阶级一起折磨得我爸爸苦了一世，临死时，他对女婿说：“我就把女儿和刨子留给你了。”以后老头子也和我爸爸一样，才过四十就折磨得成为驼背。解放了，我们开始过着幸福的晚年生活，他进了工厂有了固定的工作场所，劳动条件好多了，工作效率也比解放前有成倍的提高。可是那刨子还像是一条铁锁链，锁住工人们的手脚，任凭他们再施展本领，也还是满足不了飞速发展的建设事业的需要。
    “可以挺直腰板舒舒畅畅干了，国家要造多少房子，我们就供应多少门窗。”他一边指这指那地向我介绍情况，一边这样说。
    当他看到我欢畅的脸上挂着泪花，就递来一条毛巾，并随手接过刨子，用他那惯有的宏亮嗓音说：“好吧！就把它交给党，留给子孙后代，让他们看看，他们的祖先是用什么东西劳动的吧！”
    霎时响起一阵锣鼓声，我也夹进报喜队，擦干泪花欢乐地奔向厂党委会的办公大楼。
