Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Electric Dispatch Shanghai is vigorously promoting linter production and increasing cottonseed linter yield in its new cotton processing work to gin more linter.

This year in Shanghai, more than 90% of cottonseeds are being ginned for linter. The linter yield per hundred catties of cottonseed has generally increased from about seven catties last year to over eight catties, with the highest reaching twelve catties. As of November 16, the city has produced more than 16,000 dan of linter.

Shanghai started the work of extracting cottonseed linter early and with great intensity this year. The Shanghai Second Commercial Bureau, which is in charge of cotton processing, held four cotton processing work conferences before the new cotton came on the market, repeatedly emphasizing that ginning and linter extraction must advance simultaneously, and that linter should be extracted early, quickly, and in large quantities. In order to strengthen leadership over linter production, each processing plant divided ginning and linter extraction into two lines, with leading cadres clearly assigned to each line, taking full responsibility. Therefore, as soon as ginning began, linter extraction immediately followed.

Shanghai has taken three main measures to expand linter extraction capacity: First, using waste steel and various old materials, a batch of indigenous linter machines were self-made with reference to the sawtooth linter machine; second, on the premise of ensuring the needs of ginning, a part of the roller ginning machines were drawn out and appropriately modified to extract first and second cut linter; third, in conjunction with the overhaul of processing machinery, some roller linter machines were further modified into roller blade linter machines with higher linter extraction capacity. Shanghai's relevant materials departments also promptly transferred a batch of power equipment and accessories such as transformers, motors, wires, and bearings to support linter production. Now, each processing plant generally has about ten indigenous and foreign linter machines, and the production capacity has increased by 10 to 20% compared with last year. In mid-October, which was the peak season for cotton sales, the linter machines were operating day and night, ginning and extracting linter simultaneously. Many processing plants this year have also installed suction pipes and conveyor belts between the ginning and linter extraction workshops to achieve streamlined production, improve linter extraction efficiency, and save labor.

In order to improve the linter yield, this year, the staff of Shanghai's cotton processing plants generally extract three to four cuts from oil-pressing cottonseed, and the linter yield is increased by one to two catties compared with last year; for seed cotton, with the support of the people's communes, one or two cuts are also extracted, without damaging the cottonseeds and promoting early germination. Two and a half to four catties of linter can be extracted from every hundred catties of seed cotton.

### 扩大剥绒能力　提高棉籽出绒率  上海狠抓短绒生产

    扩大剥绒能力　提高棉籽出绒率
    上海狠抓短绒生产
    新华社上海电　上海市在新棉加工工作中，狠抓短绒生产，提高棉籽出绒率，多剥短绒。
    今年上海市90％以上的棉籽都进行剥绒，每一百斤棉籽的出绒率一般由去年七斤左右提高到八斤以上，最高的达到十二斤。到11月16日止，全市已经生产短绒一万六千多担。
    上海市今年剥取棉籽短绒的工作抓得早，抓得紧。主管棉花加工的市第二商业局，在新棉登场前，先后召开了四次棉花加工工作会议，一再强调轧花、剥绒必须同时并进，早剥、快剥、多剥短绒。为了加强对短绒生产的领导，各加工厂都将轧花、剥绒分成两条线，领导干部明确分工，各抓一条，负责到底。因此轧花一开始，剥绒就马上跟上。
    上海市采取了三个主要措施，扩大剥绒能力：第一是利用废次钢材和各种旧料，参照锯齿剥绒机实样，自造一批土剥绒机；第二是在保证轧花需要的前提下，抽出一部分皮辊轧花机，加以适当改装，剥取头道和二道短绒；第三是结合加工机具检修，进一步把部分皮辊剥绒机改装为剥绒能力较高的滚刀剥绒机。上海市有关物资部门也及时调出一批变压器、电动机、电线、轴承等动力设备和配件，支援短绒生产。现在每个加工厂一般都有土洋剥绒机具十台左右，生产能力比去年提高一两成。10月中旬正是棉花上市旺季，剥绒机具昼夜开动，随轧花，随剥绒。许多加工厂今年还在轧花和剥绒车间之间安装吸风管道、输送带，实现了一条龙生产，提高了剥绒效率，节省了劳动力。
    为了提高出绒率，上海各棉花加工厂职工今年对榨油棉籽一般都剥三道到四道，出绒率比去年提高一斤至二斤；对留种棉籽，在不破损棉籽、有利于提早发芽的原则下，取得人民公社的支持，也剥一道或两道，每百斤留种棉籽可以剥取二斤半到四斤短绒。
