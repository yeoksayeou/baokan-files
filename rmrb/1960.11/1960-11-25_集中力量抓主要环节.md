    Concentrate Forces to Grasp the Main Link
    Zhang Hongyun
    Concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles is an extremely important experience summarized by Comrade Mao Zedong in leading the Chinese people through a long period of armed struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "A war of attrition is not fundamentally decisive for a strong enemy. An annihilation battle, on the other hand, has an immediate and significant impact on any enemy. For people, injuring all ten fingers is not as good as breaking one; for the enemy, defeating ten divisions is not as good as annihilating one." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. I, p. 237) In previous revolutionary wars, the enemy was always strong and we were weak, the enemy was numerous and we were few. In order to transform ourselves from an inferior position to a superior one, we had to concentrate absolutely superior forces in each battle, and completely annihilate a part or one route of the enemy in one fell swoop, thus defeating them one by one, and gradually striving for a global advantage through many local advantages, until we finally completely eliminated the enemy. "Our strategy is 'one against ten,' and our tactics are 'ten against one.' This is one of the fundamental principles for us to defeat the enemy." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. I, p. 225)
    Today, as we engage in economic construction, we also need to learn and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical thinking.
    In a large country like ours with a large population, and building on a foundation of "poverty and blankness," there are many things we need to do. However, in a certain period, there are limits to human, material, and financial resources. Under these circumstances, on the one hand, we must strategically despise all difficulties, establish lofty ambitions, have complete confidence in rapidly changing the face of "poverty and blankness" in our country, and go all out, "one against ten," without fear in the face of any difficulties, and never retreat. We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle, daring to seize victory, daring to high speed, and daring to the Great Leap Forward. Because we firmly believe that our cause is just and our difficulties are difficulties on the road to progress. Under the brilliant light of the Party's general line for socialist construction, relying on the strength of the broad masses of the people, we can completely overcome any difficulties. On the other hand, we must tactically face up to difficulties, analyze difficulties, be practical and realistic, and work hard, "ten against one," so as to have full confidence and sufficient strength to overcome difficulties one by one and achieve comprehensive victory. There is a story: During the Warring States period, the Qi State general Tian Ji often competed with the princes in horse racing and archery. Sun Bin, a famous military strategist at the time, saw that their horses were not far apart in strength, but were divided into three classes: upper, middle, and lower. So he said to Tian Ji: "You can compete with them again, as long as you pay attention to archery, I have my own way to make you win." Before the race, Sun Bin said to Tian Ji: "Use your lower-class horse against their upper-class horse; your upper-class horse against their middle-class horse; your middle-class horse against their lower-class horse." As a result, Tian Ji lost with only one horse but won with two, defeating those who competed with him. This story tells us that in doing anything, we must learn to use our strength cleverly, and strive to use the main strength to break through the weak links and use steel on the blade. If we use our strength evenly, we will disperse our strength and be passive everywhere. Trying to get fat in one bite is in danger of indigestion. Concentrating strength puts us in an active position, because concentrating dispersed strength forms an organic whole, which is not simply the sum of the original dispersed strength, but produces a new force. A strong rope can pull a thousand pounds because millions of fibers are twisted into one strand. In boxing matches, excellent boxers never use both fists to strike the opponent at the same time, but always concentrate their strength, using one fist to knock the opponent down with one blow. Therefore, we oppose "two-fistedism and recognize one-fistedism." Once a task is started, it must be completed quickly and well, so that we can free our hands to do another one. Once a factory or mine starts construction, it must be completed quickly and well, and quickly put into production. At the same time, we must quickly transfer our strength and invest it in another construction project. In this way, we complete one project and then build another, complete a batch and then build another, so that the entire construction plan can be completed quickly, well, and economically, winning high speed.
    So, after concentrating our strength, where should we use it? Comrade Mao Zedong tells us in "On Contradiction" that in the development process of complex things, there are many contradictions, among which there must be a principal contradiction, the existence and development of which determines or affects the existence and development of other contradictions. Therefore, no matter what process we study, if there are more than two contradictions, we must find the principal contradiction and grasp the principal aspect of the principal contradiction. Once we grasp this principal contradiction and its principal aspect, all problems will be easily solved. Comrade Mao Zedong proposed the correct working method based on this principle, which is to concentrate forces to grasp the main link. In the "Decision on Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" written for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, he clearly stipulated: "In any region, there cannot be many central tasks at the same time. At any given time, there can only be one central task, supplemented by other secondary and tertiary tasks. Therefore, the chief person in charge of a region must consider the history and environment of struggle in that place, and place the various tasks in an appropriate position; instead of having no plan of his own, doing one thing after another according to the instructions of the higher authorities, forming many 'central tasks' and a disorganized state. The higher-level organs should also not assign many tasks to the lower-level organs at the same time without distinguishing between the important and the urgent, and without a center, so as to cause confusion in the lower-level organs in the work steps and fail to achieve definite results." At present, vigorously developing agriculture and vigorously developing grain production are the main links in accelerating the development of the national economy, that is, the central work of the whole Party and the whole people. We must concentrate human, material, financial resources, and leadership energy on this central work, and strengthen the agricultural front, especially the grain production front.
    Concentrating forces to grasp the main link does not mean that we should not do anything other than the central work, but rather that we should use the central work to drive other work, grasp the key links, and promote the overall situation better. This is one aspect. On the other hand, other work must be carried out around the central work. Should our department do more or less work? Should it be done urgently or slowly? All must be transferred according to the actual needs of the central work. No matter what we do, we must think about the overall situation. Is it more conducive to the central work to do this? Or is it more conducive to do that? We must consciously obey the needs of the central work and actively support the central work. This is taking the overall situation into consideration and understanding the overall situation. In order to support the central work, it is also our bounden duty to transfer some human and material resources from our own units. For these units, although the burden has increased, it is glorious. Although the difficulties have increased somewhat, these are temporary difficulties in the process of progress and can be completely overcome. Comrade Mao Zedong warned us: "Communists must understand the principle that the needs of the part must be subordinate to the needs of the whole. If an opinion appears feasible from the point of view of the part but is not feasible from the point of view of the whole, then the part should be subordinate to the whole. The same is true in the opposite case. If an opinion appears infeasible from the point of view of the part but is feasible from the point of view of the whole, then the part should also be subordinate to the whole. This is the viewpoint of taking care of the overall situation." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. II, p. 488) From a temporary point of view, there may be contradictions between the part and the whole; however, from a long-term point of view, when the whole leaps forward, the problems of the part can also be solved accordingly. Without the leap forward of the whole, the leap forward of the part is impossible, and even if there is a leap forward, it cannot be consolidated and sustained. Therefore, when there is a contradiction between the part and the whole, we must not hesitate to obey the whole. This is not only necessary for the whole, but also for the part. As the saying goes: "When the big river rises, the small river is full; when the big river has no water, the small river is dry."
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Concentrating forces seems easy, but it is quite difficult to implement. Everyone knows that it is best to win with more against less, but many people cannot do it, and instead often disperse their forces. The reason is that the leaders lack strategic thinking, are confused by the complex environment, and are therefore dominated by the environment, lose their autonomy, and adopt an approach of dealing with things as they come." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. I, p. 222) With such a clear and firm strategic mind, we can stand high, see far, view the overall situation, concentrate our strength, grasp the central work, obey the central work, and ensure the realization of the overall plan.

    集中力量抓主要环节
    张红云
    集中优势兵力，打歼灭战，这是毛泽东同志领导中国人民进行长期武装斗争中总结出来的一条极为重要的经验。毛泽东同志说：“击溃战，对于雄厚之敌不是基本上决定胜负的东西。歼灭战，则对任何敌人都立即起了重大的影响。对于人，伤其十指不如断其一指；对于敌，击溃其十个师不如歼灭其一个师。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷第237 页）在历次革命战争中，开始总是敌强我弱，敌众我寡的，为了使我们从劣势转为优势，就必须在每一次战斗中集中绝对优势的兵力，一举而全部消灭敌人的一部或一路，这样各个击破，通过许多局部的优势逐步争取全局的优势，以至最后完全消灭敌人。“我们的战略是‘以一当十’，我们的战术是‘以十当一’，这是我们制胜敌人的根本法则之一”。（《毛泽东选集》第一卷第225页）
    今天我们搞经济建设，同样需要学习和运用毛泽东同志这种战略战术思想。
    在我们这样一个人口众多的大国，又是在“一穷二白”的基础上进行建设的，我们要做的事情很多，但是，在一定时期内人力、物力、财力有一定的限度。在这种情况下，我们一方面要在战略上藐视一切困难，树立雄心壮志，对迅速改变我国“一穷二白”面貌具有必胜的信心，鼓足干劲，“以一当十”，在任何困难面前毫不畏惧，决不后退。要发扬敢于斗争，敢于夺取胜利，敢于高速度，敢于大跃进的彻底革命精神。因为我们深信我们的事业是正义的，我们的困难是前进道路上的困难。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，依靠广大人民群众的力量，是完全可以克服任何困难的。一方面又要在战术上正视困难，分析困难，实事求是，埋头苦干，“以十当一”，以便有充分的把握和足够的力量，把困难一个一个地克服，取得全面的胜利。有这样一个故事：战国时代齐国的将军田忌，常常和公子们作跑马射箭的比赛。当时著名的军事家孙膑看到他们的马力相差不远，却有上中下三等，便对田忌说：“你尽管再同他们比赛，只要注意射箭，我自有办法能使你取胜。”比赛前，孙膑对田忌说：“用你的下等马对他们的上等马；你的上等马对他们的中等马；你的中等马对他们的下等马。”结果，田忌只有一匹马不胜而有两匹马获胜，赢了同他比赛的人。这个故事告诉我们，做任何事情，都要学会巧妙地使用力量，力求把主要力量用在突破薄弱环节上，把钢用在刀刃上。如果平均使用力量，就会分散力量而处处被动。企图一口吃成个胖子，就有害消化不良症的危险。集中力量就能处于主动地位，因为把分散的力量集中起来就形成了一个有机的整体，不是原来分散的力量简单地加在一起的总和，而是产生一种新的力量。坚固的绳索所以能牵引千斤的重量，因为千万条纤维拧成了一股劲。在拳击比赛中，优秀的拳击家从来不用两个拳头同时去打击对方，总是集中力量，用一个拳头，一击而把对方打倒。所以我们反对“两个拳头主义，承认一个拳头主义”。事情不动手办则已，一动手就一定赶快办完办好，以便腾出手来再办一件。工厂矿山不动工兴建则已，一动工就一定要赶快建完建好，很快地投入生产，同时迅速转移力量，投入另一项工程建设。就这样建成一项，再建一项，建成一批，再建一批，使整个建设计划多快好省地完成，赢得高速度。
    那么，集中了力量以后，把它使用在什么地方呢？毛泽东同志在《矛盾论》里告诉我们，在复杂的事物的发展过程中，有许多的矛盾存在着，其中必有一种是主要的矛盾，它的存在和发展，规定或影响着其它矛盾的存在和发展。因此无论研究什么过程，要是存在着两个以上矛盾，就要找出其中的主要矛盾，并且抓住主要矛盾的主要方面。抓住了这个主要矛盾和它的主要方面，一切问题就迎刃而解。毛泽东同志就是根据这个原理，提出了正确的工作方法，就是要集中力量抓主要环节。他在为中共中央所写的《关于领导方法的若干问题》的决定里，明确地规定：“在任何一个地区内，不能同时有许多中心工作，在一定时间内只能有一个中心工作，辅以别的第二位、第三位的工作。因此，一个地区的总负责人，必须考虑到该处的斗争历史和斗争环境，将各项工作摆在适当的地位；而不是自己全无计划，只按上级指示来一件做一件，形成很多的‘中心工作’和凌乱无秩序的状态。上级机关也不要不分轻重缓急地没有中心地同时指定下级机关做很多项工作，以致引起下级在工作步骤上的凌乱，而得不到确定的结果。”当前，大办农业，大办粮食，是加速国民经济发展的主要环节，也就是全党全民的中心工作，我们必须把人力、物力、财力和领导的精力，集中到这个中心工作上来，加强农业战线，特别是生产粮食的战线。
    集中力量抓主要环节，并不是除了中心工作什么事情都不要办，而是用中心工作去带动其它工作，提纲挈领，纲举目张，更好地推动全局，这是一方面。另一方面，其它工作必须围绕中心工作来开展自己的业务。本部门工作是多办呢，还是少办？是急办呢？还是缓办？都必须以中心工作的实际需要为转移。无论做什么事情，都要从全局想一想，这样做更有利于中心工作呢？还是那样做更有利？要自觉地服从中心工作的需要，主动地支援中心工作。这是顾全局，识大体。为了支援中心工作，甚至要从本单位抽调一些人力物力，也是义不容辞的。对这些单位来说，担子虽然加重了，却是光荣的。困难虽然有所增加，但这是暂时的前进中的困难，是完全可以克服的。毛泽东同志告诫我们：“共产党员必须懂得以局部需要服从全局需要这一个道理。如果某项意见在局部的情形看来是可行的，而在全局的情形看来是不可行的，就应以局部服从全局。反之也是一样，在局部的情形看来是不可行的，而在全局的情形看来是可行的，也应以局部服从全局。这就是照顾全局的观点。”（《毛泽东选集》第二卷第488页）从暂时来看，局部和全局可能有矛盾；但是，从长远来看，全局跃进了，局部的问题也就可以随着解决。没有全局的跃进，局部的跃进是不可能的，即使有了跃进，也不能巩固持久。因此，当局部和全局有矛盾的时候，要毫不犹豫地服从全局，这不仅为全局所必需，而且也是为了局部。俗语说得好：“大河涨水小河满，大河没水小河干。”
    毛泽东同志说：“集中兵力看来容易，实行颇难。人人皆知以多胜少是最好的办法，然而很多人不能做，相反地每每分散兵力，原因就在于指导者缺乏战略头脑，为复杂的环境所迷惑，因而被环境所支配，失掉自主能力，采取了应付主义。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷第222页）有了这样清醒而坚定的战略头脑，才能站得高，看得远，综观全局，集中力量，抓住中心工作，服从中心工作，保证全局计划的实现。
