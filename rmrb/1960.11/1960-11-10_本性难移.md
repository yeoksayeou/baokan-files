    Inherent Nature Hard to Change
    Tian Ma Poem, Fang Cheng Painting
    Reported: The Japanese government openly reviewed fascist military forces. When the Japanese Emperor Hirohito met with the chiefs of the three armed forces, he asked them to "do a good job!" ... Fifteen years ago, they lost miserably, abandoning their helmets and armor. The aggressive arrogance was temporarily contained, and they reluctantly surrendered. Look today, they are reorganizing their forces, eager to try again, and wanting to revive the dying embers! Fascist ideology is being instilled from the beginning, and even the war criminal Tojo has been awarded the title of "martyr"! This Japanese emperor also shows his face, clamoring about "doing a good job"! All because they have the backing of the American master, colluding with each other, fanning the flames, in order to gather cannon fodder to fight on the front lines, they provide money while others risk their lives! The intention is revealed, arrogant and bold, a genuine, negative example! This aggressive nature, has it changed in the slightest?! The people have bright eyes, benefiting greatly: We must always be vigilant, and poisonous weeds must be eradicated from the root! (Attached picture)

    本性难移
    天马诗  方成画 报载：日本政府公然检阅法西斯军事力量。日本天皇裕仁在接见三军首脑时，要求他们“好好地干！”……十五年前，丢盔弃甲输得惨，侵略气焰暂时收敛，俯首投降心不甘。看今天，重整旗鼓，跃跃欲试，死灰想复燃！法西斯思想从头灌，那战犯东条也获“烈士”
  衔！这日本天皇也抛头露面，叫嚣什么“好好地干”！皆因有美国主子撑腰杆，串通一气，推波助澜，为的是搜罗炮灰打前站，人家卖命他出钱！心事披露，狂妄大胆，货真价实，反面教员！这侵略本性，何曾丝毫改变？！人民亮双眼，得益不浅：时时要警惕，毒草必须从根铲！（附图片）
