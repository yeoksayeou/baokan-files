    Revisiting the Algerian Front Lines
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Wei
    On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the Algerian people's armed uprising, with the help of the General Staff of the Algerian National Liberation Army, the reporter revisited the eastern border front lines of Algeria.
    Now is the season for the Algerian people to launch intense combat activities. The hospital where we stayed was only a few kilometers from the front line, and we could hear artillery fire and bombing almost every night. Officers from the General Staff of the Algerian National Liberation Army told us that in this area, the National Liberation Army launches attacks every night. He said, "We want to make the enemy exhausted and unable to sleep peacefully."
  For a Chinese reporter, it is particularly heart-warming that people here often talk about China's national liberation war and China's struggle experience. In the dormitory of an officer of the General Staff, we saw a book called "The War of Uprising and the War of Revolution," which has a chapter specifically introducing Chairman Mao's military thought and the experience of the Chinese revolutionary war. The officer said that he is currently studying Chairman Mao's works. He said he very much hopes to obtain a translated copy of the fourth volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong.
    Friends from the National Liberation Army here also told us that in the base areas and behind enemy lines, the broad masses of the Algerian people are waging a tenacious tunnel war against the enemy, just like the Chinese people during the Anti-Japanese War.
    Although it is early autumn, the closer we get to the front line, the more often we are greeted by hot, dry winds. At first, we didn't know the reason and thought it was hot air from the Egyptian region reaching here. Later we learned that it was because the French colonial army wanted to eliminate the heroic Algerian National Liberation Army and was terrified of every blade of grass and tree on Algerian soil. Therefore, they burned almost every mountain in Algeria, and this hot, dry wind is emitted from this. However, regardless of the French colonial army's massacres and "sweeping up," or burning every mountain, contrary to the wishes of French imperialism, the Algerian National Liberation Army has not only not been eliminated, but has grown from a team of three thousand people six years ago into an invincible force of one hundred and thirty thousand people.
    In the border area, we saw a group of new soldiers practicing target shooting, throwing grenades, and using landmines. They are intensifying their training. Algerian friends told us that almost every family in Algeria has participated in the struggle for national independence, and on average, each family has one child participating in the National Liberation Army. Their fighting will is strong. We saw some wounded soldiers in a hospital in a certain area. Normally, seriously injured patients need to be transferred to large cities for treatment, but they are unwilling to. A doctor told me with great emotion that many wounded and sick soldiers often worsen their condition because they are unwilling to be transferred, but they still firmly stated that they must see the independence of their motherland and must fight with guns against the enemy to the end. A military medical officer took out a photo of his son, a very cute child with an innocent smile on his face. He said that when he joined the National Liberation War, the child was only three years old, and now he is eight years old. Recently, he received a letter from his child, and his eight-year-old son already understood hatred for the enemy. The child said in the letter that once the French gave him money and wanted him to do things for the French army. The child replied to the French, "I don't want money, I want a gun!" This angered the French soldier so much that he scolded him as a "little fellah" (fellah means peasant or "bumpkin" and is an insulting term used by the French army for the National Liberation Army). The father, who was proud of his child, said, "Our battle is precisely for the next generation!"
    The Algerian National Liberation Army is becoming stronger and stronger in battle. Although their current weapons and equipment are still inferior compared to the French army, they have been able to increasingly seize enemy equipment and materials to strengthen their own forces. Just as Chiang Kai-shek was once the "transport captain" of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, many facts here also prove that De Gaulle and the French colonial generals have now become the "transport captains" of the Algerian National Liberation Army. At the General Staff headquarters, an officer led me to see piles of obstacles such as wires and barbed wire taken from the "Charles Line." The officer said that the enemy thought that by building the "Morice Line" along the eastern and western borders of Algeria, blocking the Algerian coast of the Mediterranean Sea to the north with the navy, and taking advantage of the impassable Sahara Desert to the south, they could trap the Algerian National Liberation Army to death. But the enemy's attempt failed. The "Morice Line" has been broken through, and the myth of the "Morice Line" has been shattered. Later, the French army built a so-called "Charles Line" in the area close to the Tunisian border. Although the "Charles Line" has countless electric fences, it still cannot stop the strong National Liberation Army. The officer from the General Staff told us that since 1959, when the National Liberation Army mastered weapons that could destroy this line, the French colonial army has built several layers of barbed wire and minefields five to six hundred meters wide on both sides of the line. But the fate of the "Charles Line" is no different from the fate of the "Morice Line." The large piece of things we saw cut from this "line" is strong proof. Some buildings in the General Staff headquarters are now made from materials from the "Charles Line."
    The person in charge of the General Staff of the Algerian National Liberation Army told us that the National Liberation Army is now mainly adopting guerrilla tactics, while also fighting some mobile warfare under favorable conditions to eliminate the enemy's effective strength. The six years of armed struggle by the National Liberation Army have gained rich combat experience, and the Battle of Souk Ahras in May this year is an example. We met Abd-al-Hazzaq, the young battalion commander who participated in this battle, at a training camp. When the people of Setif, Algeria, loudly put forward the slogan of demanding national independence in 1945, the battalion commander was only nine years old at the time. However, the French massacre of the Algerian people that year had already planted the seeds of hatred for the enemy in him. He told us about the struggle life of the people and the National Liberation Army in the first base area of the National Liberation Army, the Aures Mountains, and then talked about the Battle of Souk Ahras. He said that in this battle, the French colonial army invested seven to eight thousand people, but as a result, they were defeated.
    Souk Ahras is in Constantine Province. The National Liberation Army stationed there, after receiving intelligence that a group of French aggressor troops would pass through this area on May 25, decided to launch an attack. After careful study, the National Liberation Army chose a very favorable terrain; the road that the enemy was to pass through had two large mountains facing each other to the south, and a mountain to the north. The National Liberation Army hid two platoons on the first mountain. When the French army came along the road near the first mountain, the National Liberation Army launched a fierce attack, and after attracting the enemy, quickly transferred to the second mountain, where they waited in full battle array, because it was estimated that the angered enemy would definitely come to attack. Sure enough, the French army sent seven helicopters shortly after, and four of them landed in the open space opposite the hilltop where one of their platoons was hiding. As soon as the planes landed, the artillery fire of the National Liberation Army started. They personally saw the panicked enemy, some of whom were forcibly pushed off the helicopters. When these helicopters fled in a panic, some French soldiers were still hanging on the planes, unable to get up or down, causing the National Liberation Army soldiers to be both angry and amused. The dozens of French soldiers sent by the helicopters were completely annihilated. Soon the French army launched a fierce artillery bombardment and bombing, and used incendiary bombs to burn this mountain, but this part of the National Liberation Army had already moved to a new position.
    That afternoon, the French army sent a large number of reinforcements, attempting to encircle the National Liberation Army, but they were again repelled.
    In a fierce battle lasting a day and a night, the National Liberation Army used three companies and two platoons to attack seven to eight thousand aggressor troops equipped with airplanes, artillery, and armored vehicles. As a result, the National Liberation Army only sacrificed two soldiers, while the enemy left behind more than eighty bodies and had one plane shot down.
    As we were leaving, the person in charge of the General Staff told us, "We are prepared to wage a long-term armed struggle. Imperialism will not go along with the tide of history. Only by giving them a heavy blow, like the Indochina War, is our way out."
    Those spirited officers, soldiers, and doctors of the National Liberation Army stayed up late into the night with us, talking under the light of a kerosene lamp. They often stayed up all night. After we fell asleep, they went back into battle. (Attached picture)

    重访阿尔及利亚前线
    新华社记者　王纬
    在阿尔及利亚人民发动武装起义六周年前夕，记者在阿尔及利亚民族解放军总参谋部的帮助下，再次访问了阿尔及利亚东部边境前线地区。
    现在正是阿尔及利亚人民展开紧张战斗活动的季节。我们所住的某医院离前线只有几公里，几乎每天夜里都可以听到炮声和轰炸声。阿尔及利亚民族解放军总参谋部的军官告诉我们，就在这一带，民族解放军夜夜出击。他说，“我们要使敌人疲于奔命，不得安枕。”
  对于一个中国记者来说，感到特别亲切的是，在这里人们常常谈论中国的民族解放战争，谈论中国的斗争经验。我们在总参谋部一个军官的宿舍里的床头上，看见一本叫做“起义的战争和革命的战争”一书，其中有一章专门介绍毛主席的军事思想和中国革命战争的经验。这位军官说，最近他正在研读毛主席的著作。他说他非常希望得到毛泽东选集第四卷的译本。
    这里的民族解放军的朋友还告诉我们，在根据地，在敌人的后方，广大的阿尔及利亚人民就像中国人民抗日战争时期那样，和敌人进行着顽强的地道战。
    虽然已经是秋初，但是越接近前线，常常迎面吹来燥热的干风。最初不知道是什么原因，还以为是从埃及地区来的热空气到了这里。后来我们才知道，原来是法国殖民军队想消灭英雄的阿尔及利亚民族解放军，对阿尔及利亚土地上的一草一木都心惊胆战，因此他们几乎烧光了阿尔及利亚的每座山岭，这种燥热的干风就是由此发出的。但是，不管法国殖民军队屠杀也罢，“扫荡”也罢，烧光每座山岭也罢，和法帝国主义的愿望相反，阿尔及利亚民族解放军，不但没有被消灭，反而从六年前的三千人的队伍壮大成为一支已有十三万人的不可战胜的力量。
    在边境地区，我们看见一批新战士正在练习打靶、掷手榴弹和使用地雷。他们正在加紧训练。阿尔及利亚朋友告诉我们，几乎阿尔及利亚的每个家庭都参加了争取祖国独立的斗争，每个家庭平均有一个子弟参加了民族解放军。他们的斗争意志是坚强的。我们在某地医院里看见一些伤员。本来一般重伤病员需要转移到大城市去治疗，但是他们不愿意。一个医生极其感动地对我说，许多伤病员往往因为不愿意转移使病情加重，但是他们还是坚决表示，他们一定要看见祖国的独立，一定要拿着枪和敌人战斗到最后。一个军医官拿出一张他的儿子的照片，一个非常可爱的孩子，脸上露着天真的憨笑。他说，他参加民族解放战争那年，孩子才三岁，现在已经八岁了。最近他收到孩子的来信，八岁的小儿子已经懂得了对敌人的仇恨。孩子在信上说，一次法国人给他钱，要他给法国军队干事，孩子回答法国人说，“我不要钱，我要枪！”气得法国兵直骂他“小费拉哈”（费拉哈为农民或“土包子”的意思，是法国军队对民族解放军的侮辱性的称呼）。这位为他的孩子感到骄傲的父亲说，“我们的战斗也正是为了下一代呵！”
    阿尔及利亚民族解放军愈战愈强。他们目前的武器装备等虽然同法国军队比较起来仍然处于劣势地位，但是他们已经能够越来越多地缴获敌人的装备和物资来壮大自己的力量。就像蒋介石曾经是中国人民解放军的“运输队长”一样，这里的许多事实也证明，戴高乐和法国的殖民将军现在也成为阿尔及利亚民族解放军的“运输队长”了。在总参谋部时，一位军官领我去看成堆的从“夏尔防线”那里弄来的电线、铁丝网等障碍物。这位军官说，敌人以为沿着阿尔及利亚的东西边境筑起“莫里斯防线”，北面用海军封锁住地中海的阿尔及利亚海岸，南边又可利用无法越过的撒哈拉大沙漠，这样就可以困死阿尔及利亚的民族解放军。但是敌人的企图落空了，“莫里斯防线”已被突破，“莫里斯防线”的神话破灭了。后来，法国军队又在紧贴着突尼斯边境的地区筑起了一条所谓“夏尔防线”。尽管“夏尔防线”有无数道电网，但仍然挡不住坚强的民族解放军。总参谋部的这位军官告诉我们，自从1959年民族解放军掌握了可以击毁这条防线的武器以来，法国殖民军又在防线两侧构筑了几层铁丝网和纵深五六百米宽的地雷带。但是“夏尔防线”的命运和“莫里斯防线”的命运没有两样。我们所看到的一大片从这个“防线”上割下来的东西就是有力的证明。现在总参谋部有些建筑就是取材于“夏尔防线”的。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放军总参谋部的负责人告诉我们，民族解放军现在主要是采取游击战术，同时在有利的条件下打一些运动战以消灭敌人有生力量。民族解放军六年来的武装斗争，已经取得了丰富的战斗经验，今年5月间的苏克阿哈拉战斗就是一个例子。我们在一个训练营地会见了曾参加这场战斗的年轻营长阿卜德哈扎克。当1945年阿尔及利亚赛梯夫城人民响亮地提出了要求民族独立的口号时，这位营长当时才九岁。但是，那年法国对阿尔及利亚人民的大屠杀，已经给他种下了对敌人的仇恨种子。他向我们讲述了民族解放军的第一个根据地奥雷斯山区人民和民族解放军的斗争生活，然后谈到苏克阿哈拉战斗。他说，在这场战斗中法国殖民军投入了七、八千人，但结果被打得落花流水。
    苏克阿哈拉在康士坦丁省。驻扎在那里的民族解放军在得到一批法国侵略军将在5月25日经过这个地区的情报后，决定给予袭击。经过严密研究之后，民族解放军选择了一块非常有利的地形；敌人所要通过的公路南边有两座大山对峙，北面也有一座大山。民族解放军在第一座山上隐蔽了两个排。当法国军队沿着公路来到第一座山附近时，民族解放军发起了猛烈攻击，在吸引了敌人之后，又迅速转移到第二座山上，他们在那里严阵以待，因为估计恼怒的敌人一定会来进攻。不出所料，不久法军派来了七架直升飞机，有四架降落在他们一个排隐蔽的山头对面的空地上。飞机刚刚着陆，民族解放军的炮火就打响了。他们亲眼看见惊惶失措的敌人，有的硬从直升飞机上被推下来。当这些直升飞机怆惶逃走的时候，有些法国兵还吊挂在飞机上，上下不得，引起民族解放军战士们又气又好笑。直升飞机送来的几十个法国兵完全被歼灭了。不久法国军队发动猛烈炮击和轰炸，并且用烧夷弹焚烧这座山头，但这部分民族解放军早已转移到新阵地。
    当天下午法军又派去大批援军，企图包围民族解放军，但结果又被击退了。
    一天一夜的猛烈战斗，民族解放军以三个连两个排的兵力打击七、八千名配备有飞机、大炮、装甲车的侵略军，结果民族解放军只牺牲两个战士，而敌人却遗尸八十多具，还被打落一架飞机。
    我们临行之际，总参谋部的负责人对我们说，“我们准备进行长期的武装斗争。帝国主义是不会顺应历史潮流的，只有像印度支那战争那样，给予狠狠的打击，才是我们的出路”。
    那些神采奕奕的民族解放军的军官们、战士们、医生们，守着一盏煤石灯和我们谈到深夜。他们常常是通宵不眠的。当我们入睡之后，他们又投入战斗了。（附图片）
    阿尔及利亚人民的子弟兵——民族解放军战士和老百姓在一起。
