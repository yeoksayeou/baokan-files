Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 23rd. "Voice of the Republic of Algeria" radio tonight refuted France's absurd propaganda that the Algerian government's acceptance of aid from socialist countries constitutes a "communist danger," and pointed out that France is attempting to intimidate Algeria in this way because France's actions against the Algerian revolution have already failed militarily and diplomatically.

The radio pointed out that this absurd propaganda cannot deceive anyone in the world, and that the real danger facing the Algerian people is imperialism. The radio said that we accept the aid provided by socialist countries in order to fight against France and Western countries, and we know that this aid is precisely to help us liberate our country.

The radio then said that Algeria's real enemy is France, which is doing everything possible to exterminate our people and destroy our spiritual heritage. Algeria's real enemy is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which supports France with weapons to massacre our people. The real enemies of the Algerian people are them, not the socialist countries that unconditionally assist us.

The radio concluded by saying, "France's absurd propaganda of a so-called communist danger in our country further shows that France has been completely bankrupt in the battle against our victorious revolution."

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, November 21st. Guinean Radio broadcast a commentary on the 20th, saying that the Algerian people's struggle for freedom is a sacred struggle.

The commentary said that Africans who have been exploited, oppressed, and reduced to beasts of burden under decades of French rule, understand the justice and value of the Algerian people's aspirations better than anyone else.

The commentary pointed out that French and Western imperialism in Algeria and the Sahara is "a dagger constantly held over our heads."

The commentary said, "The cause of Algeria is the cause of the entire Africa." The commentary called on African countries to support Algeria's just cause. It pointed out, "There can be no compromise solution here. There is also no question of mediation, because to act as a mediator is to put oneself outside the struggle. To support the liberation movements of our African brothers in Algeria, the Congo, Angola, South Africa, Rhodesia, and elsewhere who are fighting for survival is to choose the freedom and happiness of Africa."

The commentary pointed out that since the Algerian patriots launched their armed struggle in 1954, the situation has changed. The myth that the French army has repeatedly touted as "the last quarter of an hour of battle" and so-called "Massu Plan", "Challe Plan" and "Ollier Plan" have all been bankrupted, and Algeria has finally become the burial ground of French imperialism.

The commentary said that De Gaulle's fraudulent tricks have also failed to make the Algerian National Liberation Front lose its vigilance. It emphasized that it would be a big mistake to think even for a moment that De Gaulle has changed his obfuscating policies.

The commentary said that today, our Algerian brothers are more confident than ever that they can achieve victory militarily and diplomatically. They have more support from the peoples of Asia and Africa than ever before.

The commentary specifically pointed out that the liberation struggle being carried out by the Algerian National Liberation Front will continue to receive the support of the great People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union.

    阿尔及利亚电台痛斥法国无耻谰言
    帝国主义是阿尔及利亚人民的真正敌人
    几内亚电台强调对戴高乐的阴谋时刻不能放松警惕
    新华社开罗23日电　“阿尔及利亚共和国之声”电台今晚驳斥法国的所谓阿尔及利亚政府接受社会主义国家的援助形成了“共产主义危险”的无稽宣传，并指出：法国企图以这种办法来恫吓阿尔及利亚，是因为法国反对阿尔及利亚革命的行动已经在军事上和外交上遭到了失败。
    电台指出，这种无稽的宣传是欺骗不了世界上任何人的，阿尔及利亚人民所面临的真正危险是帝国主义。电台说，我们为了同法国和西方国家进行斗争而接受社会主义国家所提供的援助，我们知道，给予我们的这些援助正是为了帮助我们解放我们的国家。
    电台接着说，阿尔及利亚的真正敌人是法国，法国正在千方百计灭绝我们的人民，摧毁我们的精神遗产。阿尔及利亚的真正的敌人是用武器支持法国来屠杀我国人民的北大西洋公约组织。阿尔及利亚人民的真正的敌人是它们，而不是无条件援助我们的社会主义国家。
    电台最后说，“法国无稽地宣传所谓在我国的共产主义危险，这就进一步表明，法国在反对我们胜利的革命的战斗中，已经遭到彻底的破产。”
    新华社科纳克里21日电　几内亚电台20日发表评论说，阿尔及利亚人民为争取自由而进行的战斗是一种神圣的斗争。
    评论说，那些在法国几十年统治下被剥削、受压迫、沦为牛马的非洲人，比任何人更能了解阿尔及利亚人民的愿望的正义性和价值。
    评论指出，在阿尔及利亚和在撒哈拉的法国和西方帝国主义，是经常加在我们头上的一把匕首”。
    评论说，“阿尔及利亚的事业就是整个非洲的事业。”评论要求非洲各国支持阿尔及利亚的正义事业。它指出，“这里不能有折衷的解决办法。也谈不上什么调停，因为以调停者自居，那就是把自己置身于斗争之外。支持在阿尔及利亚、刚果、安哥拉、南非、罗得西亚以及其他地方非洲人弟兄们争取生存的解放运动，就是选择非洲的自由和幸福。
    评论指出，自从1954年阿尔及利亚爱国者展开武装斗争以来，局势已经有了变化。法军一再扬言是“最后一刻钟的战斗”的神话以及什么“马絮计划”、“夏耳计划”和“奥尔蒂计划”，都遭到了破产，而且阿尔及利亚终于成为法帝国主义的葬身之地。
    评论说，戴高乐的诈骗伎俩也未能使阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线丧失警惕。它强调指出，那怕一时认为戴高乐已经改变了他故弄玄虚的政策，那就大错特错了。
    评论说，今天，我们的阿尔及利亚兄弟比过去任何时候更有把握能在军事上和外交上取得胜利。他们比过去任何时候更加得到亚非人民的支持。
    评论特别指出阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线继续进行的解放斗争，将继续得到伟大的中华人民共和国和苏联的支持。
