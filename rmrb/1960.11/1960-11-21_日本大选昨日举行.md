Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th: Japan held its 29th House of Representatives election today. Starting from 7:00 AM, voters in 118 constituencies across the country cast their ballots to elect 467 members of the House of Representatives. As of 6:00 PM today (Tokyo time), all voting has concluded. Counting is now underway in each constituency. The full results of the election will be announced on the afternoon of the 21st.

In order to obstruct the progress of progressive forces, the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries have adopted all kinds of shameless means, such as violent suppression, political deception, and bribery, to sabotage the election campaigns of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party and to control the general election. Japanese monopoly capital groups have provided far more election funds this year than in previous elections to support the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Because the Liberal Democratic Party candidates have engaged in more vote-buying and various fraudulent activities than in previous elections, violations of election laws have increased more than twofold compared to the 1958 House of Representatives election.

    日本大选昨日举行
    新华社20日讯　东京消息：日本今天举行第二十九次众议院选举。从早晨七点开始选民在全国一百一十八个选区投票选举四百六十七名众议员。到今天下午六点（东京时间）为止，投票已经全部结束。现在，各选区正在计票。选举的全部结果将在21日下午揭晓。
    为了阻挠进步力量取得进展，美日反动派采取了暴力镇压、政治欺骗、金钱收买等种种无耻手段，破坏日本共产党和社会党的竞选活动，控制大选。日本垄断资本集团今年拿出了远远超过以前几次选举时的巨额选举资金来支持执政的自由民主党。由于自由民主党候选人比前几次选举时进行了更多的贿选和各种舞弊活动，违反选举法的事件比1958年的众议院选举时增加了两倍多。
