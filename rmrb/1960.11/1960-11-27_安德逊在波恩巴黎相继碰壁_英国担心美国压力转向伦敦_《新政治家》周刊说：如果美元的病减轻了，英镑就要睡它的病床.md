Xinhua News Agency, London, November 25th (Reporter Yan Biao): After seeking financial assistance in Bonn and Paris without success, U.S. Treasury Secretary Anderson and Under Secretary of State Dillon arrived in London by plane today. Immediately upon arrival, they began talks with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd and Lord Privy Seal Heath, hoping to squeeze some money out of Britain, whose own economy is already strained.

	The arrival of these two U.S. special envoys in Britain coincides with the U.S. gold reserves falling below the dangerous point of $18 billion for the first time since 1940. The U.S.’s multi-billionaires have found themselves in a position to ask their European partners for contributions; this has been followed by a farce of blackmail and counter-blackmail, with each partner crying poverty. These facts vividly reflect the severity of the U.S. international payments crisis and economic crisis, and the increasingly acute contradictions between Western countries.

	Before Anderson and Dillon arrived in London, British newspapers launched a campaign to pressure West Germany to accept U.S. demands, while heavily publicizing Britain's own difficulties. The failure of the U.S.-Bonn talks increased Britain's fear that U.S. pressure would shift to Britain, requiring it to alleviate the U.S.'s payment difficulties in some way. Today's headline in the *Daily Express*, "U.S. Troublemakers Arrive," is a typical reflection of Britain's mood in receiving these two U.S. special envoys.

	According to reports, the U.S. delegation's main concern in London is to ask Britain to "do something" in light of Bonn's rejection of U.S. demands. Sources say that Britain will be asked to persuade Adenauer to change his decision not to pay more occupation fees for U.S. troops stationed in West Germany when he visits Britain in December. Although any signs of estrangement between Washington and Bonn would not be unwelcome in Britain, Britain has conflicting feelings on this issue. On the one hand, Britain hopes that West Germany will pay more, so that it can benefit in two ways: both avoiding U.S. demands on Britain and learning from the U.S. to demand that Bonn bear more of the occupation costs of British troops stationed in West Germany. But on the other hand, Britain is worried that if West Germany is really forced to agree to pay for U.S. occupation forces, Britain will have to follow suit and bear the costs of U.S. troops stationed in Britain. West Germany's suggestion that Britain and France should also bear more of the costs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has met with opposition here. *The Times* wrote today that even if West Germany agrees to pay more for British troops stationed in West Germany, this money will be offset if Britain has to bear greater expenses for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

	It is believed that the unexpected participation of Lord Cobbold, Governor of the Bank of England, in today's talks indicates that one of the issues discussed was to "seek ways" to stabilize the gold market and curb the outflow of U.S. dollars. Newspaper reports say that during today's talks, the U.S. special envoys asked Britain to further lower its bank interest rate to ease the flow of dollars to Britain. High interest rates have helped Britain attract "hot money" from abroad, thereby making up for its trade deficit caused by declining exports. It is known that Britain's small reduction of 0.5% in the bank interest rate is far from meeting the U.S.'s wishes; it is merely a gesture of concession to the U.S. The British Treasury fears that further lowering the bank interest rate will cause those "hot money" to immediately flow out of Britain, thereby subjecting Britain to a payment crisis.

	At the same time, the British side expressed "unease" that the U.S. is attaching "buy American" conditions to its foreign "aid," which will harm British exports. Newspapers here also expressed concern that the U.S. special envoys will put pressure on Britain to relax restrictions on U.S. goods, especially industrial products. Although U.S. goods in Britain do not encounter the same treatment as British goods in the U.S. market, with only a few important goods subject to Britain's "quota system," Britain does impose high tariffs on certain U.S. goods, including automobiles. There are also concerns that the U.S. may threaten to take further restrictive measures against British goods entering the U.S. market.

	There are also concerns that the U.S., in order to further reduce its dollar expenditures, may lower the duty-free allowance for U.S. travelers buying goods in Britain to bring back home. Eisenhower's earlier decision to reduce the number of U.S. military dependents abroad may already cause Britain to lose $20 million in revenue. And newspapers here reported that half of Britain's international payments surplus of 74 million pounds came from the money spent by U.S. personnel stationed in Britain.

	As the latest issue of the *New Statesman* wrote in commenting on today's Anglo-American talks, "Whatever action the United States takes, we (Britain) are bound to suffer." It also said that if the dollar's illness lessens, the pound will sleep in its sickbed; if the United States benefits, Britain will inevitably suffer.

    安德逊在波恩巴黎相继碰壁
    英国担心美国压力转向伦敦
    《新政治家》周刊说：如果美元的病减轻了，英镑就要睡它的病床
    新华社伦敦25日电　本社记者言彪报道：在波恩和巴黎觅求财政援助而毫无所得的美国财政部长安德逊和副国务卿狄龙，今天乘飞机来到伦敦。刚一到达，他们便同英国财政大臣劳埃德和掌玺大臣希思开始会谈，希望从本身经济已很拮据的英国挤出些钱来。
    当这两个美国特使来到英国的时候，正值美国黄金储备自1940年以来第一次下降到一百八十亿美元的危险点以下。美国的亿万富翁们发现他们自己已经处在要他们的欧洲小伙伴捐款的地位；随之而来演出了一场敲诈和反敲诈的闹剧以及每一个小伙伴都发出一片叫穷声；这些事实生动地反映了美国国际支付危机和经济危机的严重性和西方国家之间日益尖锐的矛盾。
    在安德逊和狄龙到达伦敦之前，英国报纸展开了这样一个运动：压迫西德接受美国的要求，同时大事宣传英国本身的困难。美国和波恩会谈的失败增加了英国的担心，怕美国的压力转向英国，要它用某种方法减轻美国的支付困难。《每日快报》今天的标题《美国制造麻烦的一伙人飞来了》，正是英国在接待这两个美国特使时的典型心情。
    据报纸透露，美国代表团在伦敦主要关心的是：要求英国在波恩拒绝美国要求后的局面下，“做些事情”。有消息说，将会要求英国在阿登纳12月访问英国的时候劝他改变不肯为驻西德美军多出占领费的决定。尽管任何华盛顿和波恩之间疏远的迹象在英国是不会不受欢迎的，但是英国在这一问题上却有着矛盾心理。一方面，英国希望西德多出钱，这样它可以从两方面得到好处：既可免去美国对英国提出要求，又可学美国的样要求波恩更多承担驻西德英军的占领费。但是另一方面，英国又担心，如果西德真的被迫同意支付美国占领军费用的话，英国也就不得不步西德的后尘而承担驻英美军的费用。西德提出的要英法两国也多承担一些北大西洋集团的费用的建议，在这里就遭到了反对。《泰晤士报》今天写道，即使西德同意更多支付驻西德英军的费用的话，如果英国要向北大西洋集团承担更大的开支，这笔款子也就会被抵销。
    人们认为，英格兰银行总裁柯波德勋爵出人意料地参加了今天的会谈，表明会谈讨论的问题之一是要
  “寻求办法”来稳定黄金市场和制止美国美元外流。报纸消息说，美国特使在今天的会谈中要求英国进一步降低银行利率，以缓和美元流向英国的趋势。高利率曾帮助英国从外国捞取“游资”，从而弥补了它由于出口下降而造成的贸易逆差。人们知道，英国把银行利率小小地降了0.5％，远不能满足美国的愿望，它只不过是作为向美国让步的一种姿态。英国财政部担心，再降低银行利率，就将使那些“游资”立即流出英国，从而使英国遭到支付危机。
    同时，英国方面对于美国对外“援助”附加“买美国货”的条件将损害英国出口表示“不安”。这里的报纸还表示担心，美国特使将对英国施加压力，要它放松对美国货、特别是工业产品的限制。虽然美国货在英国同英国货在美国市场上的遭遇不一样，只有很少几种重要货物受到英国“限额制度”的限制，但是英国对包括汽车在内的某几种美国货却是征收很高的关税的。人们还担心，美国可能要威胁对英国货进入美国市场采取进一步限制措施。
    人们还担心，美国为了进一步削减它的美元支出，可能降低美国旅客在英国买物品回国时免关税的数量规定。艾森豪威尔早些时候决定减少美国军人在国外的家属，已经可能使英国失去二千万美元的收入。而这里的报纸报道，英国国际支付顺差的七千四百万英镑中就有一半得自美国驻英人员所花的钱。
    就像最近一期《新政治家》周刊在评论今天的英美会谈的时候所写的，“不论美国采取什么行动，我们（英国）必定会遭殃。”它还说，如果美元的病减轻了，英镑就要睡它的病床，如果美国得到好处，英国就必定吃亏。
