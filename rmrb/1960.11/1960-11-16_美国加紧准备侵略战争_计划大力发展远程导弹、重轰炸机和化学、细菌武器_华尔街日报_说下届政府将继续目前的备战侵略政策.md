Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 14th: The United States government is stepping up the development of all kinds of new weapons and actively preparing for wars of aggression.

According to a report in the "Wall Street Journal" on October 28th, the US government is currently "vigorously developing long-range missiles." The newspaper stated that in order to strengthen America's so-called "deterrent force," the heads of the US Department of Defense have planned "to continue to rapidly develop a diversified arsenal of long-range missiles" and are preparing to mass-produce missiles in the next five years.

The newspaper said that at the same time, "The Pentagon is quietly becoming interested in manned aircraft again." In order to seek "more insurance" for preparing for war, the heads of the Department of Defense are also "developing new types of aircraft" while vigorously developing missiles. "Since both candidates (Kennedy and Nixon) have talked about continuing to develop bombers (in the election campaign), there is every reason to believe that this trend of wanting to develop new types of aircraft will continue." The "Wall Street Journal" also specifically pointed out: "It is of great significance that the next government, regardless of which party is in power, will heavily rely on the opinions of many military leaders who formulated today's plans."

According to the "Wall Street Journal," one of the new types of aircraft that the US government is stepping up to develop is the B-58 "Hustler" bomber. The newspaper made no secret of the US government's intention to prepare to attack the Soviet Union and other socialist countries by stepping up the development of this aircraft. It said that the US government hopes that "this fast B-58 will enable us (the United States) to increase long-range strike capabilities when only a few ICBMs are in service. It can easily fly from foreign bases to Russia and back." According to the newspaper, the amount of money the United States has currently ordered for this type of aircraft exceeds $3 billion. The "Wall Street Journal" also said that the Pentagon is also preparing to "put more money" into the development of the "B-70 'Valkyrie' bomber." In addition, "The Navy is increasing the power of bombers stationed on aircraft carriers at sea." "The Navy has not only replaced all the defensive aircraft on two aircraft carriers abroad (one in the Mediterranean and one in the Pacific) with bombers capable of dropping nuclear weapons on Communist targets, but also increased the number of such aircraft loaded on the other four aircraft carriers that the United States maintains overseas." The "Wall Street Journal" also said that the Pentagon also plans to develop a "new type of transport aircraft" in order to "transport personnel and weapons" to carry out "small-scale wars."

"US News & World Report" magazine also reported that the White House "has issued orders to accelerate the development of space and defense (referring to expanding armaments and preparing for war) and will spend more money in this area." The magazine said that the US government recently announced that it would "greatly expand" the development of the B-70 bomber. In the 1961 fiscal year, the Air Force received $265 million to develop this aircraft, which is almost twice the original amount.

According to the "National Guardian" weekly, the US government is also stepping up preparations for "chemical and bacteriological warfare." Eisenhower has "apparently agreed" to let the Army Chemical Corps launch a large-scale propaganda campaign to "promote" chemical and biological warfare. A group of reporters who have been "carefully screened" were recently taken to visit the 1,300-square-mile chemical, bacteriological, and applied radiological test site in Dugway, Utah. This is the first time this has happened since the end of World War II. According to the weekly, Joseph Prentiss, the head of the US chemical, bacteriological, and radiological weapons training class, openly expressed "enthusiasm for bacteriological and chemical warfare," and the Army Chemical Corps also touted that bacteriological weapons are "better than nuclear weapons." The weekly said, "Spokesmen for the Chemical Corps have been emphasizing the development of non-lethal psychochemicals," and at the same time, "the Army has already spent billions of dollars on deadly nitrogen mustard gas and nerve gas."

    美国加紧准备侵略战争
    计划大力发展远程导弹、重轰炸机和化学、细菌武器
    “华尔街日报”说下届政府将继续目前的备战侵略政策
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在加紧发展各式各样的新武器，积极准备侵略战争。
    据“华尔街日报”10月28日报道，美国政府目前正在“大力发展远程导弹”。这家报纸说，为了加强美国的所谓“威慑力量”，美国国防部的首脑们已计划“要继续迅速发展一个远程导弹的多样化兵工厂”，并且准备在今后五年大批生产导弹。
    这家报纸说，与此同时，“五角大楼正在没有引人很大注意地又再次对有人驾驶的飞机感到兴趣”。国防部的首脑们为了对准备战争谋求“更多的保险”，在大力发展导弹的同时也在“发展新型的飞机”，“由于（肯尼迪和尼克松）两位候选人（在竞选中）都谈到继续发展轰炸机，因此完全有理由相信，这种想发展新型飞机的趋势将继续下去。”“华尔街日报”还特别指出：
  “具有重要意义的是：下届政府不论是哪一党执政，都将大力倚重许多制定今天的计划的这一批军事领袖们的意见。”
    据“华尔街日报”说，目前美国政府加紧发展的新式飞机之一是B—58型“冲击者式”轰炸机。这家报纸毫不掩饰美国政府加紧发展这种飞机的打算是准备攻击苏联和其它社会主义国家。它说，美国政府希望“这种快速的B—58将使我们（美国）在只有很少几枚洲际导弹可以服现役的时候增加远程打击力量，它可以从国外的基地上毫不费力地飞到俄国去并且返回来”。据这家报纸说，美国目前订购这种飞机的款项已超过三十亿美元。“华尔街日报”还说，五角大楼目前还准备“把更多的钱”用于发展“B—70‘瓦尔基莉式’轰炸机”。此外
  “海军方面正在增加在海上的航空母舰上所停放的轰炸机的力量”，“海军不仅用能够向共产党目标投掷核武器的轰炸机替换了在国外的两艘航空母舰（一艘在地中海、一艘在太平洋）的全部防御飞机，而且美国保持在海外的另外四艘航空母舰上所装载的这种飞机的数量也增加了。”“华尔街日报”还说，五角大楼还计划发展一种“新式的运输机”，以便“运送人员和武器”来进行“小规模战争”。
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志也报道说，白宫“已发出了加速发展空间和防务（指扩军备战）的命令，并将在这方面花更多的钱。”这家杂志说，美国政府最近已宣布要“大力扩大”B—70型轰炸机的发展工作。在1961财政年度，空军就得到了两亿六千五百万美元来发展这种飞机，这个数目几乎为原来数目的两倍。
    据“国民前卫”周刊报道，美国政府同时加紧在准备“化学和细菌战”。艾森豪威尔“显然已经同意”让陆军化学兵团发动一次大规模的宣传运动来“推销”化学和生物战争，一群经过
  “谨慎的甄别”的记者不久前被带去参观犹他州杜韦地方的面积一千三百平方英里的化学、细菌学和应用辐射学试验场，这是第二次世界大战结束以来第一次出现的事情。据这家周刊说，美国的化学、细菌和放射性武器训练班负责人约瑟夫·普伦提斯公开表示“热心于细菌和化学战”，陆军的化学兵团也大肆鼓吹细菌武器比核武器更好”。这家周刊说，“化学兵团的发言人们一直强调发展非致命性的心理化学物品”，同时，“陆军已经在致命的氮芥气和神经性毒气上花了数十亿美元。”
