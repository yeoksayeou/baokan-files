Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 26th: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement at a press conference held here this afternoon, saying that the situation in the Congo is becoming increasingly serious; all kinds of chaotic phenomena in the Congo are the result of the aggressive and interventionist policies pursued by the United States, Belgium, and other imperialists.

The statement said that the heroic fighters struggling for Afro-Asian solidarity and all peace-loving people in the world should more and more clearly draw the following lessons: "First, the United States is using the United Nations in the Congo to implement its aggressive policies, and similar things will happen elsewhere; second, American imperialism is increasingly becoming the number one enemy of freedom and genuine friendship among all peoples."

The statement pointed out that in order to eliminate neo-colonialism and frustrate U.S. imperialism and its allies, the Afro-Asian people know what path they must take: rely on the people's struggle, and strengthen the people's determination, vigilance, and unity.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, November 24th: The *Ghanaian Times* published an editorial today condemning the United States for provoking the current bloody incidents in the Congo.

The editorial, titled "Terrible Neo-Colonialism," said that the "expulsion" of Welbeck and the bloody incidents in Leopoldville are part of a meticulously prepared conspiracy. The newspaper believes that the U.S. Representative to the United Nations, Wadsworth, has inextricable links to this conspiracy. It said that Mr. Wadsworth has always been opposed to Africa, so it is not surprising that he supported Mobutu in "expelling" the Ghanaian representative Welbeck from the Congo, and he was elated by this infamous event. However, "his actions expose the policies now being implemented by his unpopular, soon-to-be-departed government."

The editorial pointed out that the bloodshed in the Congo was provoked by the United States, and the United Nations has become an inglorious accomplice to the evildoers.

The editorial, referring to the United States' manipulation of the United Nations to allow Kasavubu to steal the Congo's seat in the United Nations, said, "It is disgraceful for a country that talks about individual freedom, democratic principles, and political integrity day after day to adopt such tactics." It said that Africans regret that the United States is standing among a group of countries that have proven not to be friends of African unity, and "people can now recognize the truth."

The editorial, after pointing out that the United States deliberately undermines African unity, said that it is intriguing that Kasavubu and Mobutu—the unquestionable agents of neo-colonialism—fiercely oppose the mediation committee composed of Asian and African countries that the United Nations plans to send to the Congo. This shows that, as imperialists often say when talking about Africans, "the more we divide them, the more we can exploit them." Neo-colonialists are using this evil plan in the Congo.

Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, November 25th: The Guinea News Agency published a commentary today pointing out that the United States' forcing the United Nations General Assembly to accept Kasavubu's delegation has "disregarded the will expressed by the Congolese people and Parliament, who are diametrically opposed to those who only represent foreign interests in the Congo."

The commentary said: From the very beginning of the events in the Congo, we have repeatedly condemned the conspiracies of Belgian and American imperialists in this matter, which was concocted by the West. The commentary pointed out that by doing so, the United States should bear serious responsibility to the whole world. Africa, having recognized this situation, will take measures to defend the independence and territorial integrity of the Congo.

    亚非人民团结组织书记处发表声明
    谴责美国制造刚果混乱局势
    《加纳时报》严斥美国在刚果挑起流血事件几内亚新闻社谴责美国策划干涉刚果的阴谋
    新华社开罗26日电　亚非人民团结组织书记处今天下午在这里举行的记者招待会上发表声明说，刚果局势日益严重；刚果的种种混乱现象，是美国、比利时和其他帝国主义奉行侵略和干涉政策的结果。
    声明说，为亚非团结而斗争的英勇战士和世界上一切爱好和平的人民应该愈来愈清楚地吸取到这样的教训：“第一，美国在刚果利用联合国来实行它的侵略政策，在其他地方还会发生类似的事情；第二，美帝国主义愈来愈成为反对自由和各国人民真正友谊的头号敌人”。
    声明指出，为了消灭新殖民主义、挫败美帝国主义和它的同盟者，亚非人民知道他们必须走什么道路，这就是：依靠人民斗争，并且加强人民的决心、警惕和团结。
    新华社阿克拉24日电　《加纳时报》今天发表社论，谴责美国挑起目前刚果的流血事件。
    这篇题为《可怕的新殖民主义》的社论说“驱逐”韦尔贝克以及利奥波德维尔发生的流血事件都是经过周密准备的阴谋的一部分。这家报纸认为美国驻联合国代表华兹沃斯同这项阴谋有着千丝万缕的联系。它说，华兹沃斯先生历来反对非洲，所以他支持蒙博托把加纳代表韦尔贝克“驱逐”出刚果，是不足为怪的，他对这个不名誉的事件感到兴高采烈。但是，“他的这种做法暴露了他的不得人心的即将卸任的政府现在所执行的政策”。
    社论指出，刚果的流血事件是美国所挑起的，联合国已成了凶作恶者的不光采的帮凶。
    社论在谈到美国操纵联合国来使卡萨武布窃取刚果在联合国的席位时说，“对于日复一日高谈个人自由、民主原则和政治上正直的一个国家来说，采取这样的策略是不光采的”。它说，非洲人因为美国站在已经证明不是非洲团结的朋友的那些国家的集团中间而感到遗憾，“人们现在能够认清真相了”。
    社论在指出美国蓄意破坏非洲团结之后说，耐人寻味的是，卡萨武布和蒙博托——新殖民主义者的无可置疑的代理人激烈反对联合国计划派往刚果的由亚非国家组成的调解委员会。由此可见，正如帝国主义者通常谈到非洲人时所说的那样，“我们愈使他们分裂，我们就愈能利用他们。”新殖民主义者正是在刚果使用这个邪恶的方案。
    新华社科纳克里25日电　几内亚新闻社今天发表评论指出，美国强使联合国大会接纳卡萨武布的代表团，这样就使“同只代表在刚果的外国利益的那些人针锋相对的刚果人民和议会所表达的意志横遭漠视”。
    评论说：早在刚果发生事件之初，我们就一再谴责比利时和美国帝国主义者在这个问题上所施展的阴谋诡计，而这个问题是西方所一手泡制的。评论指出，美国这样做，它就应对全世界负严重的责任。认清了这种事态的非洲，将采取措施来保卫刚果的独立和领土完整。
