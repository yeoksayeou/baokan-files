Xinhua News Agency, London, 19th – British newspapers are buzzing about the measures taken by U.S. President Eisenhower to alleviate the serious deficit in the U.S. balance of international payments. Some believe that they will not solve many problems, while others express concern that these measures will harm British interests.

The conservative "Daily Telegraph" yesterday said in a mocking tone that Eisenhower's plan to link U.S. "overseas defense" and "aid" spending with a "buy American" movement, and to reduce the number of dependents of U.S. overseas troops, was "absurd."

This newspaper believes that it is difficult for the United States to get rid of the "balance of payments dilemma" it is "facing," which has some "lamentable characteristics."

The "Financial Times," the mouthpiece of the City of London, frankly stated that the British Treasury and British capitalists do not welcome the U.S.'s significant reduction in dollar spending by its overseas troops. It estimates that Britain earned about 200 million dollars from the expenditures of U.S. troops last year.

The "Financial Times" then pointed out that a series of measures that the United States intends to take to cope with the international payment crisis will reduce Britain's business by 20 million pounds. The newspaper also specifically talked about the impact of the U.S. restriction on overseas troops bringing their families on British economic life. It said that a large number of U.S. troops are stationed in the East Anglian Plain and Ruislip and Oxford west of London, and in some places, U.S. military families even account for a quarter of all residents. Locals call these areas "Little America." If they leave, "the prosperous—sometimes extortionate—market for furnished suites and houses in these areas will vanish like a bubble, and sales of general goods and revenue from labor services will also decrease… seaside hotels on the east coast will also suffer."

The Liberal Party's "Guardian" is also afraid that the dollar crisis may be detrimental to British interests. It worriedly said: "If (America's) reserves continue to be depleted, it is not impossible to cut foreign aid and take protectionist measures against other countries." In order to avoid this possibility, the newspaper joined the United States in putting pressure on West Germany. It said that West Germany, which "has a large surplus," "has a special responsibility" to "prevent a more serious crisis." It should immediately announce a plan to increase "aid" to underdeveloped countries and "should also agree to fund the maintenance costs of U.S. troops stationed in Germany."

### 英国担心美国嫁祸于人  保守党报纸认为美国很难摆脱困境

    英国担心美国嫁祸于人
    保守党报纸认为美国很难摆脱困境
    新华社伦敦19日电　英国报纸对美国总统艾森豪威尔为缓和美国国际收支的严重逆差而采取的措施议论纷纷，有的认为解决不了多少问题，有的表示担心这些措施将损害英国的利益。
    保守党的“每日电讯报”昨天以讥讽的口吻说，艾森豪威尔把美国的“海外防务”和“援助”开支同
  “买美国货”的运动联结在一起，并且减少美国海外驻军随军眷属的数目，这种计划是“荒唐的”。
    这家报纸认为，美国很难摆脱它“面临的支付平衡困境”，这种困境具有一些“可悲的特征”。
    伦敦城的喉舌“金融时报”坦率地说，英国财政部和英国资本家不欢迎美国大大削减它的海外驻军的美元消费。它估计，去年英国从美国驻军的开销中获得的美元约达两亿元。
    “金融时报”接着指出，美国为了应付国际支付危机而打算采取的一系列措施将使英国少做两千万英镑的生意。这家报纸还特别谈到美国限制海外驻军携带家属对英国经济生活的影响，它说，美军大量驻扎在东英格兰平原和伦敦西部鲁斯里普、牛津等地，其中有些地方美军家属甚至占全部居民四分之一，当地人把这些地区叫做“小美国”。如果他们走了，“这些地区繁荣的——有时是敲诈性的——带家具的套房和房屋市场将像泡沫一样地消灭，一般货物的销售量和劳务的收入也将减少……东海岸的海滨旅馆也会受损失”。
    自由党人的“卫报”也害怕美元危机可能有损于英国的利益。它担心地说：“如果（美国的）储备继续消耗下去，削减对外援助和针对其他国家的贸易采取保护性措施不是不可能的。”为了避免这种可能，这家报纸帮助美国一同向西德施压力，它说，“拥有大量出超”的西德“格外有责任”来“防止出现更严重的危机”，它应该立即宣布对不发达国家增加“援助”的计划，“也应该同意资助美国驻德军队的维持费”。
