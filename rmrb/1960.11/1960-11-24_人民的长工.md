    The People's Hired Hand
    Nie Zihong, Zhongnan Survey Team, Xingyang, Henan

    "What is called hardship? Communist Party members are the people's hired hands; wherever they are needed, that is the most joyful thing." This is what Comrade Gu Guishan, a veteran Red Army regimental commander in his sixties, now the deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Qinjia’gang Brigade of the Yuankang Commune in Linxian, Henan, and director of the public canteen of the production team, said. This is the language of revolutionaries.

    People often say, "Communist Party members are made of special materials." What is this "special material"? That is having no selfish or self-interested thoughts, being wholeheartedly for the revolution, wholeheartedly for the people, and truly achieving "worrying about the world's troubles before anyone else, and enjoying the world's happiness after everyone else." For the benefit of the masses, they are willing to go through fire and water and dare to step forward. What hardship, what fatigue, are not even considered!

    Comrade Gu Guishan's words truly come from the bottom of his heart. First of all, he considers himself to be the "people's hired hand," taking serving the people as his lifelong duty. It is not easy to truly be a good "people's hired hand." To gain the trust and support of the masses, and to handle the affairs of the masses well, one must first have noble thoughts like Comrade Gu Guishan to be able to practice what one preaches.

    人民的长工
    河南荥阳中南勘察队　聂子洪
    “什么叫受累？共产党员是人民的长工，哪里需要就到哪里去，那最愉快不过了。”这是六十来岁的老红军团长、现河南林县元康公社秦家岗大队党支部副书记兼生产队公共食堂事务长的顾贵山同志的话。这是革命者的语言。
    人们常说：“共产党员是特殊材料制成的”。这“特殊材料”是什么？那就是毫无自私自利之心，一心为革命，一心为人民，真正做到“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”。为了人民群众的利益，即使赴汤蹈火，他们也心甘情愿，敢挺胸前去。什么苦，什么累，哪里看在眼下！
    顾贵山同志的话是真正发自心底的。首先，他就认为自己是“人民的长工”，把为人民服务当作自己终身的职责。要真正做好“人民的长工”并不容易。要得到群众的信任，群众的拥护，要把群众的事情办好；这首先要有像顾贵山同志那样高尚的思想，才能够说到做到。
