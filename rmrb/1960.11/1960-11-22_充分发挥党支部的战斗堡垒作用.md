    Give Full Play to the Fighting Fortress Role of Party Branches

    Strengthening the work of Party branches is the foundation for us to do all our work well. The Party branch is the Party's grassroots organization and a fighting fortress for implementing the Party's policies and ensuring the completion of various work tasks.

    To give full play to the fighting fortress role of Party branches, it is necessary to give full play to the role of every Party member as an advanced fighter. A major manifestation of a Party member's role as an advanced fighter is maintaining close ties with the masses. In this regard, many of our advanced branches have created many good experiences. In particular, the "four guarantees" and the "five down-to-the-grassroots" political and ideological work currently being implemented by some branches of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company are relatively complete experiences in closely connecting with the masses and deeply mobilizing them. To fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, it is necessary to first strengthen political and ideological work and constantly improve the ideological consciousness of the masses. And this cannot be done well by relying on a few people. Simply relying on the leadership to make one or two reports cannot completely solve the problem. The fundamental solution is to adopt the mass line method under the leadership of the Party branch and Party小组 (Party small groups/cells), rely on every Party member to carry out regular, meticulous, and in-depth work, and integrate political and ideological work into the masses' production, learning, and daily life activities. By adopting the method of division of labor and responsibility, each Party member is responsible for "guaranteeing" several members of the masses, and mobilizing veteran workers to mentor new workers, and Communist Youth League members to mentor young people. This both publicizes the Party's policies, conducts ideological education for the masses, and modestly learns from the masses and listens to their opinions. This can form a lively situation of mutual care and mutual assistance, with everyone participating in political and ideological work, learning from each other's strengths and overcoming weaknesses, and improving together. With Party members as the core, the broad masses are closely united around the Party branch, better playing the fighting fortress role of the Party branch.

    Recently, Party branches of units such as the steelmaking workshops of the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Converter Plant and No. 1 Open Hearth Plant, based on the characteristics of steelmaking production, put forward the battle slogans of "one furnace of steel is a battle, and one shift is a campaign" and "one furnace of steel is a campaign, and one process is a battle." They conduct in-depth and meticulous political and ideological work by convening Party小组 (Party small groups/cells) meetings at the furnace side in a timely manner to study changes in production conditions and people's thinking, solve key production problems, and give full play to the core leadership role of the Party小组 (Party small groups/cells). Therefore, it has also greatly exerted the fighting power of the Party's political and ideological work and promoted the development of production. Steelmaking production is as tense as fighting a war, and production conditions often change during the production process. Under such circumstances, various advanced thoughts are clearly manifested, and various advanced experiences are constantly emerging. At the same time, with the changes in production conditions, some people's thinking will also fluctuate. Only by going deep into the entire production process, promptly grasping and promoting various advanced factors, and solving various ideological problems can we seize every minute and second to ensure the sustained high tide of production. Therefore, it is not only necessary to do a good job in political and ideological work before and after shifts, but also more importantly to do a good job in political and ideological work during shifts, and to integrate political and ideological work into every production process.

### 充分发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用

    充分发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用
    加强党的支部工作，是我们做好一切工作的基础。支部是党的基层组织，是贯彻党的方针政策、保证完成各项工作任务的战斗堡垒。
    要充分发挥支部的战斗堡垒作用，必须充分发挥每个党员的先进战士作用。党员先进战士作用的一个主要表现就是要与群众保持密切的联系。在这一方面，我们许多先进支部创造了许多很好的经验，特别是重钢一些支部现在所推行的“四包”、政治思想工作“五下”等等经验，更是密切联系群众，深入发动群众的一些比较完整的经验。要充分发挥群众的积极性，首先就要加强政治思想工作，不断提高群众的思想觉悟。而这又不是依靠少数人所能做得好的，单纯依靠领导上作一两次报告是不能完全解决问题的，根本办法还是要在党支部和党小组的领导之下，采取群众路线的方法，依靠每个党员进行经常的、细致的、深入的工作，把政治思想工作深入到群众的生产、学习以及日常生活等各种活动当中去。采取分工包干的办法，每个党员负责“包”几个群众，并且发动老工人包新工人，团员包青年，一方面宣传党的方针政策，向群众进行思想教育，一方面虚心向群众学习，听取群众意见。这就能形成互相关心，互相帮助，人人动手作政治思想工作的生动局面，取长补短、共同提高，以党员为核心，把广大群众紧紧地团结在党支部的周围，更好地发挥支部的战斗堡垒作用。
    最近，重钢转炉一厂、平炉一厂冶炼工段等单位党的支部，根据炼钢生产的特点提出了“一炉钢是一个战斗，一个班是一个战役”和“一炉钢是一个战役，一个工序是一个战斗”的战斗口号，针对生产条件的变化和人们思想的变化，及时召开炉边党小组会进行研究，进行深入细致的政治思想工作，解决生产关键，充分发挥了党小组的核心领导作用，因而也大大地发挥了党的政治思想工作的战斗威力，推动了生产的发展。炼钢生产像打仗一样，非常紧张，在生产过程中生产条件又常常要发生变化。在这种情况之下，各种先进思想表现得很明显，各种先进经验也不断涌现出来；同时随着生产条件的变化，在一些人的思想上也要引起一些波动，只有深入生产的全部过程，及时抓紧和发扬各种先进因素，解决各种思想问题，才能争分抢秒，保证生产的持续高涨。所以不仅要作好班前班后的政治思想工作，更重要的是要作好班中的政治思想工作，把政治思想工作深入到每一个生产过程中去。（摘自重庆日报）
