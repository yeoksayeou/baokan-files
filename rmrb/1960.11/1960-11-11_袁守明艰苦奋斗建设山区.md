    Yuan Shouming Works Hard to Build Mountainous Areas
    (Our Dispatch) Yuan Shouming, member of the Longhai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fujian and Party Branch Secretary of the Houfang Farm, loves agricultural labor and is determined to build mountainous areas, leading all farm workers in opening up mountains to grow grain and turning barren hills into grain fields.
    Yuan Shouming worked as a hired hand for more than ten years in the past. After joining the revolution, he still maintained the true qualities of the working people and loved agriculture and labor. After Yuan Shouming came to the farm at the end of 1957, he set an example by working hard and leading the masses to reclaim wasteland and develop production. In just over a year, he planted more than 10,000 mu of fruit trees on a desolate land, and livestock and poultry also developed in groups. As the family business grew bigger and bigger, the number of workers increased from more than twenty to more than one hundred and thirty. In order to change the cold-water paddy fields in the mountain gullies, Yuan Shouming sought advice everywhere and finally found a way to transform the cold-water paddy fields. He led the cadres, first digging the soil, then burning the soil with fire, and draining the cold water from the dry ditches to improve a piece of field. As a result, everyone started working, and more than 1,700 mu were improved at once. This spring, all of them were planted with early rice. After half a year of hard work, the early season achieved a bumper harvest.

    袁守明艰苦奋斗建设山区
    本报讯　中共福建龙海县县委委员、后房农场党总支书记袁守明，热爱农业劳动、发愤建设山区，领导全场职工开山种粮，变荒山为粮田。
    袁守明过去曾当过十多年长工，参加革命后，仍保持着劳动人民的本色，热爱农业、热爱劳动。1957年底，袁守明来到农场后，以身作则，埋头苦干，带领群众开垦荒地，发展生产。仅一年多时间，就在一片荒凉的土地上种上了一万多亩果树，家畜家禽也成群地发展起来，家业越大人越多，工人从二十多人增到一百三十多人。为了改变山坑冷水田，袁守明处处求教，终于找到了改造冷水田的办法。他带领干部，先动手铲土，然后用火烧土，排出干沟的冷水，改好了一片田。这么一来大伙都干开了，一下改好了一千七百多亩，今年春季全部种上了早稻，经过半年的艰苦奋斗，早季获得了丰收。
