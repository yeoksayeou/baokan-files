    Prevent Wheat Rust Early
    People's Daily Commentator
    Rust (commonly known as yellowing disease) is a major disease of wheat and a major enemy of increased wheat production. Wheat-producing areas in China experience varying degrees of rust disease every year. This year, there was more rain and fog during the wheat sowing season, and the temperature and humidity were very suitable for the occurrence of wheat rust. Currently, rust disease has been found in some early-sown wheat in wheat-producing areas such as Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi, Xinjiang, and Guizhou, and there is a trend of spread. Preventing rust early and eliminating it in its initial stage has become an important measure to ensure increased wheat production next year.
    In the past, some people believed that large-scale prevention and control of wheat rust was difficult. Since the Great Leap Forward, this view has been shattered by facts in many places, and various regions have created certain experiences in the large-scale prevention and control of wheat rust. Rust is a parasitic infectious disease. The pathogen parasitizes on wheat and multiplies and develops under certain conditions. The occurrence of rust depends on three aspects: pathogen, host (wheat), and environmental conditions. If there is no pathogen, of course, the disease will not occur. With the pathogen, if the wheat grows with strong stems and strong disease resistance, the disease will be very mild or will not occur. Only when the three factors of pathogen, host, and environmental conditions are all present will the disease occur on a large scale. As long as we grasp the law of rust occurrence, eliminate the pathogen early, and cultivate strong plants, rust can be completely prevented. In recent years, many agricultural scientists have cooperated with people's communes in various places to conduct in-depth investigations, and have further understanding of overwintering and overwintering bases of rust pathogens, and studied the epidemic rules in different regions. They have provided effective measures for the prevention and control of various rust diseases.
    Rust harms wheat in three periods, namely the overwintering, greening, and heading stages of wheat, among which the harm of rust occurring after the heading stage is the greatest. However, taking practical measures to prevent rust spores from overwintering is not only very beneficial to the healthy growth of wheat seedlings, but also plays a great role in preventing rust from occurring during the greening and heading stages. If rust spores are allowed to hide and lie dormant, it will bury the root of the disease for the spread during the greening and heading stages of wheat next year. Rust pathogens parasitize on wheat and can reproduce for many generations, generally reproducing one generation every eight to twelve days. The current period is the breeding period of rust. Under suitable conditions, a spore heap can produce thousands of pathogenic spores a day and can continue to produce them for half a month. Therefore, eliminating one spore now is equivalent to eliminating tens of millions of spores next year. Early prevention and control now, to the greatest extent, control and eliminate the source of infection, can greatly reduce the area of ​​spread next year, reduce the harm next year, and the prevention and control work in the next two stages. If action is taken too late, it will be difficult to extinguish after a large number of rust bacteria hibernate in the wheat leaf tissue overwinter. At present, some areas in Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, and Gansu have taken action and are determined to eliminate rust before winter. However, in some wheat-producing areas, although rust has occurred, sufficient attention has not been paid to prevention and control work, and measures should be taken quickly.
    In recent years, the state has significantly increased the quantity and variety of pesticides and agricultural machinery for rust prevention. However, it is not enough to rely entirely on these pesticides and machinery for large-scale prevention and control. Various regions should also use a large number of effective indigenous pesticides and agricultural machinery and prevention and control methods suitable for local needs. In view of the rules of occurrence of stripe rust, Shaanxi Province proposed the prevention and control methods of "destroying the source of infection, attacking three stages" (overwintering, greening, and heading) and "burying soil and cutting leaves." After large-scale promotion, significant results have been achieved. This year, Weinan, Fengxiang, Xingping, Chang'an and other counties in Shaanxi have guaranteed a bumper harvest of wheat in the year of rust epidemic due to the resolute implementation of these measures.
    Rust prevention should be combined with irrigation, top dressing, and cultivation to increase production, so that wheat seedlings are strong and enhance disease resistance. The Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture is an organic whole and must be fully implemented. We should better combine strengthening field management and doing a good job in plant protection work to ensure a bumper harvest of wheat.

    及早防治麦锈病
    本报评论员
    锈病（俗称黄疸病）是小麦的主要病害，是小麦增产的大敌。我国小麦产区，每年都有程度不同的锈病发生，今年小麦播种时期雨多，雾多，温度、湿度都很适合小麦锈病的发生。目前，在河南、山东、陕西、甘肃、山西、新疆、贵州等小麦产区，部分早播麦已发现锈病，而且有传播蔓延的趋势。及早防治锈病，把锈病消灭在初生阶段，就成为保证明年小麦增产的一项重要措施。
    过去有人认为大面积防治小麦锈病是困难的。大跃进以来，这种说法已经被许多地方的事实打破了，各地对于大面积防治小麦锈病，已创造了一定的经验。锈病是一种寄生性的传染病，病菌寄生在小麦上，在一定条件下繁殖和发展起来的。锈病的发生，决定于病原、寄主（小麦）和环境条件三个方面。如果没有病原，当然不会发病。有了病原，如果小麦长得茎秆强壮，抗病力强，病害发生很轻或不会发生。只有在病原、寄主和环境条件三者兼备的情况下，病害才会大量发生。只要我们掌握了锈病发生规律，及早消灭病原，培植强壮的植株，锈病完全可以防止。几年以来，许多农业科学工作者配合各地人民公社进行深入调查，对于锈病病菌越冬及越冬基地有了进一步了解，研究了不同地区的流行规律。对于各种锈病的防治，提供了有效措施。
    锈病危害小麦是在三个时期，即小麦的越冬、返青及孕穗抽穗期，其中又以孕穗以后发生锈病危害最大。但采取切实措施，不让锈病孢子越冬，不仅对于小麦幼苗健壮生长有很大好处，对于防止返青及穗期发生锈病是有很大作用。如果让锈病孢子隐藏潜伏下来，就为明年小麦返青及穗期的传播蔓延埋下病根。锈病的病菌寄生在小麦上，可以繁殖好多代，一般经过八到十二天就可以繁殖一代。目前正是锈病繁殖时期，一个孢子堆，在适宜的条件下，一天可以产生几千个病菌孢子，并且可以连续产生半个月。因此，现在消灭一个孢子，等于明年消灭几千万个孢子。现在及早防治，最大程度地控制和消灭病源，就可以大大缩小明年的传播蔓延面积，减轻明年的危害和以后两关的防治工作。如果动手过迟，大量的锈病菌蛰伏到麦叶组织里越冬以后，就难以扑灭了。现在，陕西、河南、山西、甘肃部分地区，已经行动起来，决心把锈病消灭在冬前。但有些小麦产区，锈病虽已发生，但对于防治工作，还没有引起足够的重视，应该赶快采取措施。
    几年以来，国家对于防治锈病的农药、农械，在供应数量上和种类上已有显著增加。但完全要靠这些药械进行大面积防治还是不够的。各地还要大量使用行之有效的土药械和适合当地需要的防治方法。陕西省针对条锈菌发生的规律，提出“灭菌源、攻三关”（越冬、返青、孕穗）和“埋土切叶”的防治方法，经过大面积推行，已取得显著成效。今年，陕西渭南、凤翔、兴平、长安等县，由于坚决贯彻了这些措施，在锈病大流行的年份，仍然保证了小麦的丰产丰收。
    防治锈病要和灌溉、施追、中耕等增产措施结合起来，使麦苗茁壮，增强抗病能力。八字宪法是一个有机的整体，必须全面贯彻，应该把加强田间管理和作好植物保护工作更好的结合起来。确保小麦的大丰收。
