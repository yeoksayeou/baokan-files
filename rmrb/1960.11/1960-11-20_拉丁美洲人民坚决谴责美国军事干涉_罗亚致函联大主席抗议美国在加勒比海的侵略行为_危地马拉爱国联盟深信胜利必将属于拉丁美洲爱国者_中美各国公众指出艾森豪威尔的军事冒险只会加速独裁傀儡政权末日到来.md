Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch from New York: Cuban Foreign Minister Roa wrote to UN General Assembly President Boland on the 18th, protesting the United States' dispatch of aircraft and warships to the Caribbean region.

In the letter, Roa emphasized that the United States' actions are "a blatant violation of the principle of non-interference and an act of aggression."

Roa also stated that Eisenhower's order to send troops to the Caribbean is "an act of aggression by North American imperialists" and a "fatal blow to the Organization of American States."

Roa requested that his letter be distributed to the delegates of the 15th session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 18th: Cuba's "Revolución" and "Hoy" strongly condemned the US President's order to send naval and air forces to the Caribbean.

"Revolución" pointed out that the statement released yesterday regarding the United States dispatching aircraft and warships to interfere in the internal affairs of Guatemala and Nicaragua is a "show of force to intimidate the Cuban revolutionary government." "Revolución" emphasized that "the men and women of Latin America who have been scorned countless times by imperialists and their local servants should raise a unified voice to protest this interference in the internal affairs of countries fighting for liberation."

An editorial in "Hoy" pointed out that the dispatch of warships, aircraft, and troops to the Caribbean region "demonstrates the desperation of imperialism." The newspaper said that this demonstration of military strength is not only intended to intimidate Guatemalans and other Central Americans, to intimidate the people of our American countries, but also aimed at Cuba. These military forces "are another factor in the real aggression against Cuba that they are preparing." "Hoy" pointed out that they will serve as a cover for mercenaries and will protect the attackers that they themselves prepared, organized, and paid for.

The editorial emphasized, "However, this new conspiracy must fail just like previous conspiracies." It said, "Cuba, the Cuban people, and its revolutionary leaders will never be afraid."

The editorial also said, "If the 'devils' land in Guatemala, they will reap hatred beyond their leaders' expectations and will ignite resistance even greater than all the resistance caused by their economic exploitation and verbal insults."

At the same time, various revolutionary organizations in Santiago also issued public statements protesting US military intervention. The 26th of July Movement stated that in the face of Eisenhower's fascist policies, the free brothers of Latin America and the world will never stand idly by.

The People's Socialist Party's statement emphasized that the military actions taken by the United States are an aggression against all the people of Latin America. The Frank País Farmers' Association of Oriente Province stated in its statement that Cuban farmers support the struggle of the people of Guatemala and Nicaragua. The statement pointed out that the intervention of US imperialism cannot prevent the day when Latin America will be free from imperialist oppression and finally break the chains of exploitation.

In Holguín City, upon learning the news of the Eisenhower administration's dispatch of troops, people immediately poured into the streets and held protest rallies. Speakers at the rally unanimously called on the people of Latin America to unite in the struggle against US imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 18th: A statement from the Cuban branch of the (Guatemalan) Patriotic League was published here today. The statement was signed by former Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz, as well as Julio Cáceres, Luis Díaz Gómez, and Oscar Palma. The statement strongly condemned the US Eisenhower administration's "order to dispatch naval forces to the Guatemalan coast." The statement pointed out, "This means shameless interference. This is actual aggression against our country."

The statement pointed out the conclusive facts, which condemned US imperialism and its lackeys in Guatemala and Nicaragua from all angles. "Therefore, in this unfortunate moment, we ask all peoples of the continent to be vigilant and to issue a strong protest against the aggression and brutality being carried out in Central America, because the danger is common, and only the unified action of all peoples who love progress, peace, and rights can defeat imperialism."

The statement expressed support for and assistance to the ongoing struggle of Guatemalan patriots. The statement pointed out that the difficult economic situation and political repression are the real causes of the people's growing discontent, which has led to armed uprisings in Guatemala. "The insurgents in Guatemala have won the sympathy of the people of all countries, not only because of the justice of their cause, but also because of their resolute and firm actions."

The statement pointed out that "the conclusive facts that have occurred in Guatemala at this critical juncture show that a new stage in our country's history has begun. The anti-imperialist wind of our time is also blowing fiercely in our homeland. With its strong blow, new will and the determination to carry out an indestructible struggle are formed."

The statement said: "Victory will belong to the patriots, not to those who kowtow to imperialism," "The future belongs to the new forces that are flourishing in Guatemala."

The statement condemned US imperialism and the Ydígoras government for falsely claiming that the Cuban revolutionary government is helping the uprisings. The statement pointed out that Eisenhower's dispatch of troops to Guatemala is an "international provocation, attempting to use it to make people believe that the Cuban revolutionary government did indeed assist the Guatemalan insurgents." The statement emphasized that Guatemala has become a base for US aggression against Cuba. "The Ydígoras government is attempting to create a smokescreen to conceal the proven and serious fact that he has turned Guatemalan territory into a major base for aggression against Cuba." The statement said, "The Cuban government has never engaged in any direct or indirect interference in Guatemalan affairs. Just as it did not export its own revolution, which is worthy of emulation, Cuba did not export revolution."

Xinhua News Agency, San José, 18th: People from Central American countries expressed great indignation at the US imperialists' recent new military provocations of sending naval and air forces to the Caribbean region.

Some Central American intellectuals, nationalists, and politicians residing in Costa Rica pointed out that the increasing support of the Central American people for the Cuban revolution and the surge in the anti-imperialist struggle has made Washington impatiently and openly embark on the extremely dangerous path of military occupation of Central America and preparing to directly invade Cuba under the guise of "defending" its coasts.

When summarizing the situation in Central America, these people said: "Even with the support of the US fleet, the imperialists' running dogs in Central America will not be able to hold out for long. Their days are numbered. Eisenhower's military adventure will further accelerate their demise."

Xinhua News Agency, San José, 18th: Costa Rican Congressman Marcial Aguiluz said in Congress yesterday regarding the US Navy's dispatch of naval and air forces to the Caribbean Sea and its airspace near Cuba: "Eisenhower's order to protect the dictatorial rule that oppresses the people of Guatemala and Nicaragua" is also "aimed at invading Cuba."

He also said: "Imperialism feels that the ground under their feet is already shaking. The Central American people's struggle to free themselves from imperialism and its running dogs, the dictators Somoza and Ydígoras Fuentes, cannot be suppressed by the appearance of American warships. We all, the dignified and impoverished Latin Americans, repeatedly say: An attack on Cuba is an attack on all of us, and this is not an empty phrase. We Latin American people are no longer afraid of imperialism. Imperialism is just a paper tiger."

    新华社19日讯　纽约消息：古巴外交部长罗亚18日写信给联合国大会主席博兰，抗议美国派遣飞机、军舰前往加勒比海地区。
    罗亚在信中强调指出，美国的行动是“罪恶昭彰的违反不干涉原则的，而且是一个侵略行动”。
    罗亚还说，艾森豪威尔发出的派遣军队去加勒比海的命令，是“北美帝国主义者的一个侵略行动”，并且是“对美洲国家组织的致命的打击”。
    罗亚要求把他的信散发给出席联合国大会十五届会议的各国代表。
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　古巴“革命报”和“今日报”今天强烈地谴责美国总统下令派海空军去加勒比海的行动。
    “革命报”指出，昨天所发表的美国派遣飞机和军舰去干涉危地马拉和尼加拉瓜内政的声明是“恐吓古巴革命政府的实力示威”。“革命报”强调指出，“拉丁美洲的曾经千百次遭受过帝国主义者及其本地仆从蔑视的男男女女，应该发出一致的声音，抗议这种对正在为争取解放而斗争的国家的内政的干涉。”
      “今日报”在社论中指出，派遣军舰、飞机和军队到加勒比海地区“表明了帝国主义的绝望”。这家报纸说，这次军事实力示威不仅是为恐吓危地马拉人和其他中美洲人，恐吓我们美洲各国的人民，而且也是对准古巴的。这些军事力量
  “是他们所准备的对古巴的真正侵略的又一个因素。”“今日报”指出，他们将作为雇佣兵的掩饰物，将保护他们自己准备、组织和付钱的进攻者。
    社论强调指出，“但是，这个新的阴谋一定要像以往的阴谋一样遭到破产”。它说，“古巴、古巴人民及其革命领导人决不会害怕。”
    社论还说，“如果鬼子们在危地马拉登陆，他们将出乎他们的魁首意料地收获到仇恨，并将激发比他们的经济剥削和口头侮辱所引起的一切反抗更大的反抗。”
    与此同时，圣地亚哥各革命组织也纷纷发表了公开声明，抗议美国的军事干涉。7月26日运动的声明说，面对艾森豪威尔的这种法西斯政策，拉丁美洲和世界各国自由的兄弟人民将决不袖手旁观。
    人民社会党的声明强调美国采取的军事行动是对拉丁美洲全体人民的侵略。奥连特省弗兰克·派斯农民协会在声明中表示古巴农民支持危地马拉和尼加拉瓜人民的斗争。这项声明指出，美帝国主义的干涉不能阻止有一天拉丁美洲将摆脱帝国主义的压迫而获得解放，并且最后挣断剥削的锁链。
    在奥尔金城，当人们得知艾森豪威尔政府出动军队的消息后立即涌向大街，举行了抗议大会。大会上的发言者一致号召拉丁美洲人民在反对美帝国主义的斗争中团结起来。
    新华社哈瓦那18日电　这里今天发表了（危地马拉）爱国联盟古巴支部的一项声明，这项声明是由危地马拉前总统哈科沃·阿本斯以及胡利奥·卡塞雷斯、路易斯·迪亚斯·戈麦斯和奥斯卡·帕耳马签署的。声明强烈地谴责美国艾森豪威尔政府“下令派遣海军部队到危地马拉海岸”的行动。声明指出，“这就意味着无耻的干涉。这就是对我国的实际侵略。”
    声明指出了确凿的事实，这些事实从各个角度谴责了美帝国主义及其在危地马拉和尼加拉瓜的走狗。“因此，在这个不幸的时刻中，我们要求大陆上各国人民都警惕起来，对于在中美洲所进行的侵略和残暴活动发出强有力的抗议的呼声，因为危险是共同的，只有爱好进步、和平和权利的各国人民的统一行动才能战胜帝国主义。”
    声明表示支持和援助危地马拉爱国者正在进行的斗争。声明指出，困难的经济局势和政治镇压是人民不断增长的不满情绪的真正原因，这种不满情绪已经导致了危地马拉的武装起义。“危地马拉的起义者已经赢得了各国人民的同情，这不仅是由于他们事业的正义性，而且是由于他们坚决的和坚定的行动。”
  声明指出，“在危地马拉这个危急关头中发生的确凿的事实表明，我国历史上的一个新阶段已经开始了。我们时代的反帝国主义风也在我们祖国猛烈地吹着。随着它的劲吹，形成了新的意志和进行不可摧毁的斗争的决心。”
    声明说：“胜利将属于爱国者，而不属于那些对帝国主义卑躬屈节的人”，“未来属于正在危地马拉蓬勃生长的新生力量”。
    声明谴责美帝国主义和伊迪戈拉斯政府诬称古巴革命政府正在帮助起义的阴谋。声明指出，艾森豪威尔政府派部队到危地马拉是一个
  “国际挑衅，企图靠它使人们相信，古巴革命政府确实援助了危地马拉起义者”。声明强调指出，危地马拉已经变成了美国侵略古巴的基地。“伊迪戈拉斯政府企图制造烟幕，掩饰他已经把危地马拉领土变成侵略古巴的主要基地这个已经得到证明的严重事实。”声明说，“古巴政府从来没有进行对危地马拉事务的任何直接或间接的干涉。就像它自己没有输入它这样一个称得上榜样的革命一样，古巴并没有输出革命。”
    据新华社圣约瑟18日电　中美国家人士对美帝国主义最近派遣海军和空军部队到加勒比海地区的新的军事挑衅表示极大愤慨。
    居住在哥斯达黎加的一些中美国家的知识分子、民族主义者和政界人士指出，中美洲人民对古巴革命愈来愈多的支持和反帝国主义斗争的高涨，使得华盛顿迫不及待地和毫不掩饰地走上了对中美洲实行军事占领、并且在“保卫”它的海岸的掩盖下准备直接侵略古巴的极端危险的道路。
    这些人士在总结中美洲局势的时候说：“帝国主义在中美洲的走狗即使在美国舰队的支持下也支持不了很久了。他们的日子已经屈指可数了。艾森豪威尔的军事冒险将更加加速他们末日的到来。”
    据新华社圣约瑟18日电　哥斯达黎加议员马西亚尔·阿吉卢斯昨天在议会里就美国海军出动海上和空军部队前往古巴附近的加勒比海及其上空一事说：“艾森豪威尔为了保护压迫危地马拉和尼加拉瓜人民的独裁统治”而发出的这一命令，其“目的也在于侵略古巴”。
    他还说：“帝国主义感觉到他们脚下的土地已经在动摇了。中美国家人民争取摆脱帝国主义及其走狗、独裁者索摩查和伊迪戈拉斯·富恩特斯的解放斗争不可能由于美国军舰的出现而遭到抑制。我们全体尊严和贫苦的拉丁美洲人一再重复说：攻击古巴就是攻击我们大家，这并不是一句空话。我们拉丁美洲人民已经不害怕帝国主义了，帝国主义只不过是一只纸老虎。”（附图片）
