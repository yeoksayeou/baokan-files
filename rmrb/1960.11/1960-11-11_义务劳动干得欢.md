    Enthusiastically Engaging in Voluntary Labor
    By Our Correspondent Wang Chongjie

    In the past two years, voluntary labor has been organized in various parts of Hungary. Many glorious deeds of selfless and unrewarded labor fully reflect the working people's desire and sense of responsibility to accelerate socialist construction, and reflect the tremendous power of mass consciousness. The widespread voluntary labor has not only created huge material wealth, but also brought profound changes to people's mental outlook.

    A New City Built on the Banks of the Danube
    Vehicles and crowds are constantly pouring into "Lágymányos," some waving red flags, some holding banners, and some singing joyful songs. The army of voluntary labor is in high spirits and full of fighting spirit.

      "Lágymányos" is a vast area in Budapest, located under Gellért Hill, where the Statue of Liberty stands, and on the banks of the blue Danube River, covering an area of nearly 700 acres. A long time ago, there were only two small lakes here. Later, it gradually became a large garbage dump. The residents of the capital, who love their city, wanted to change the appearance of "Lágymányos," located between the mountains and rivers, as soon as possible. Based on the rationalization proposals of the masses, this summer, the Executive Committee of the Budapest City Council, the City Party Committee, the City Patriotic People's Front and other organs and social organizations jointly decided: to transform "Lágymányos" into a park with complete facilities within three years through voluntary labor, and to build a permanent exhibition hall with an area of 30,000 square meters and a temporary exhibition hall of more than 20,000 square meters, making this large garbage dump the center of cultural, recreational and sports activities for the residents of the capital and a modern "Industrial Expo City."

    This decision was warmly welcomed by the residents of the capital, and the number of people who signed up to participate in voluntary labor was very enthusiastic, exceeding the required labor force by more than two times. People participating in voluntary labor are organized by region and work unit. Twenty-two districts in the capital, plus the two large enterprises of Csepel Iron and Steel Works and Ganz-Mávag Locomotive Works, total twenty-four units. The people who signed up in each unit take turns participating in labor according to the plan.

    The first labor began on August 22. More than 700 workers from the Csepel Iron and Steel Works, with a long revolutionary tradition, took the lead. Gáspár Sándor, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, first secretary of the Budapest City Committee, and responsible cadres of the capital's party and government organs and social organizations also participated in the first day of labor.

    From August 22 to October 15, a total of more than 70,000 people participated in the labor, which is almost three times the number of people originally scheduled to participate in the labor during this period. Every day, in addition to the organized labor force by unit, there are often many "guerrillas" who come and work alone. After completing their work tasks, various factories and enterprises sent trucks and excavators to "Lágymányos" to participate in voluntary labor. If there was a lack of labor tools, factories and enterprises also automatically helped solve the problem. Many residents came with their own tools. The workers of the "Orion" radio equipment factory also installed loudspeakers on this vast construction site so that people could listen to the radio at any time.

    The progress of construction is currently far exceeding the predetermined targets. Next spring, the heavy industry section of the Industrial Expo will be exhibited here. In less than three years, people will admire everything on this garbage dump with astonished eyes, and "Lágymányos" will become the pride of Budapest.

    Boundless Swamps Transformed into Fertile Fields
    When it comes to voluntary labor, people often mention the pioneering work of young people conquering the Hanság swamp. Hanság is a swampy area in Győr-Sopron County, western Hungary, covering an area of about 500,000 mu. For centuries, stagnant water has occupied this fertile land. Are people really weak in the face of nature? No! The young people of Hungary issued a loud voice: "We must conquer nature and turn the swamp into fertile fields!"

    In the summer of 1958, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League organized more than 3,000 young students who volunteered to participate in the voluntary labor of conquering Hanság. They set up tents here, set up a battle line, and launched the first large-scale attack on Hanság. Many cadres of the Central Committee of the League also personally participated in the labor. Workers and farmers in the vicinity also rushed to actively support the bold initiative of the young people. In the short summer, they excavated a total of 90,000 cubic meters of soil and opened a drainage ditch with a length of more than 28,500 meters. This turned 130,000 mu of wilderness into fertile fields, and enabled large areas to graze livestock.

    The ranks of conquering Hanság grew even stronger in the summer of 1959, with nearly 5,000 people participating in this work. They also drained the stagnant water on 24,000 mu of swamp land, and turned over more than 100,000 cubic meters of soil, digging a waterway of 24 kilometers long. According to statistics, in the summer of 1959, young people completed voluntary labor here worth more than 1.5 million forints (Hungarian currency).

    This summer, the number of young people participating in labor and the labor achievements they completed have doubled compared with last year.

    The young people are very motivated. Every day at six o'clock in the morning, they face the morning sun, vigorously run out of the tent, shoulder shovels and picks, and line up in neat rows to the construction site to dig canals for drainage and excavate large waterways. The young men worked shirtless in the scorching sun. Knee-deep mud, stinging reeds and weeds could not stop the advance of the labor volunteers.

    In just three summers, the face of Hanság has changed dramatically. The swamps of the past have become pieces of fertile fields, and groups of cattle and sheep are grazing on the green fields.

    The great significance of summer voluntary labor is far more than these economic benefits. When the tanned young men and women return to their homes and schools, their thoughts and feelings have also undergone great changes. They have personally experienced the life of labor and improved their understanding of the great significance of labor. They have strengthened their collectivist spirit in the struggle against nature, and their enthusiasm for learning is even greater.

    Hungarian friends are full of confidence and say: Hanság will definitely be completely and thoroughly conquered, and crops, orchards, beautiful villages, buildings and gardens will appear on the wasteland of the past.

    Working Together to Accelerate Socialist Construction
    In order to accelerate socialist construction, the broad masses of the people have contributed their efforts in various forms in cities, villages, factories and mining areas.

    In Budapest alone, 160,000 people participated in voluntary labor last year, completing work worth 35 million forints. This year, the residents of the city have proposed to complete work worth 44 million forints. They used voluntary labor to build new schools, cultural palaces and stadiums, opened up new gardens, and paved new roads. The residents of the ninth district also donated funds to build a Young Pioneers Palace for the children.

    The emerging steel capital, Sztálinváros, has been continuously developing and expanding for ten years. The broad masses of the people use their spare time to build stadiums, build children's amusement parks, plant trees and flowers, and recently opened a large urban park. Today, Sztálinváros is not only a base for heavy industry, but also a very clean, tidy and beautiful city.

    The workers in the Borsodnádasd coal mining area use voluntary labor to help build mines. The young workers of the Csepel Iron and Steel Works unanimously decided to participate in 15,000 hours of voluntary labor to complete the construction of the transformer factory ahead of schedule. They also used their spare time to make a car for transporting hot soft steel. The workers of the Csepel Power Plant launched a "Communist Sunday" movement, using voluntary labor on Sundays to assemble wires for new factory buildings.

    In order to support agricultural cooperatives and develop agricultural production, various factories and enterprises have established fixed ties with cooperatives. Workers often use their spare time to go to the countryside to help farmers build livestock sheds, install electric lights, and repair machines. During the busy farming season, they help farmers with harvesting. This year, young steel rolling workers from the Lenin Steel Works volunteered more than 10,000 hours of work in nearby agricultural cooperatives during the busy farming season. By the end of this year, the "Youth Construction Team" will use voluntary labor to build more than 100 cowsheds for agricultural production cooperatives.

    This summer, a total of more than 21,000 young students participated in voluntary labor. In addition to participating in the struggle to conquer Hanság, more than 1,200 young people in Hajdú-Bihar transformed 550 hectares of swamp land into fertile fields. Nearly 3,000 college and middle school students participated in the construction of the Danube Cement Plant. More than 5,000 girls organized seven labor camps to participate in agricultural production in the countryside during the summer. Now Pécs University is being expanded, and the students of the school actively participate in voluntary labor in their spare time.

    The Young Pioneers are not to be outdone. They often launch national movements to collect scrap iron and waste paper. In the past winter and spring months alone, the Young Pioneers of Tolna County collected 70,000 kilograms of scrap iron and made 14 tractors for the farmers. (Attached picture)

    义务劳动干得欢
    本报记者　王崇杰
    近两年来匈牙利各地纷纷组织义务劳动。很多不取报酬、忘我劳动的光辉事迹，充分反映了劳动人民加速社会主义建设的愿望和责任感，反映了群众觉悟的巨大威力。广泛展开的义务劳动，不仅创造了巨大的物质财富，而且给人们的精神面貌带来了深刻的变化。
    多瑙河畔建新城
    一辆辆的汽车，一行行的人群，不断地涌向“拉兹玛尼奥什”，有的打着红旗，有的举着标语牌，有的唱着欢乐的歌曲。义务劳动的大军兴高采烈，斗志昂扬。
      “拉兹玛尼奥什”是布达佩斯市内的一片空旷地区，位于耸立着自由神像的盖莱特山下，蓝色的多瑙河畔，面积近七百亩。很早以前，这里只有两个小湖。后来，逐渐变成一个大垃圾场。热爱自己的城市的首都居民，看到位于山水之间的“拉兹玛尼奥什”的景象时，都想尽快地改变它的容颜。根据群众的合理化建议，今年夏天，布达佩斯议会执委会、市党委、市爱国人民阵线等机关和社会团体共同决定：用义务劳动在三年内把“拉兹玛尼奥什”改建成一个设备完善的公园，并且在这里建筑面积达三万平方米的经常性展览馆，二万多平方米的临时性展览馆，使这片大垃圾场变成首都居民文娱体育活动的中心和现代化的“工业博览城”。
    这一决定公布后，受到首都居民的热烈欢迎，报名参加义务劳动的人非常踊跃，比需要的劳动力超过了两倍多。参加义务劳动的人是按地区和工作单位组织起来的。首都二十二个区，再加上切佩尔钢铁厂和甘兹—马瓦格机车厂两个大型企业，共二十四个单位。各单位报名的人按计划轮流参加劳动。
    第一次劳动是8月22日开始的。富有悠久革命传统的切佩尔钢铁厂的七百多名职工首先出马。社会主义工人党政治局候补委员、布达佩斯市委第一书记加什帕尔·山多尔，首都党政机关和社会团体的负责干部也参加了第一天的劳动。
    从8月22日到10月15日共有七万多人参加了劳动，差不多相当于原订这期间参加劳动人数的三倍。每天，除按单位有组织的劳动队伍之外，还经常出现很多单独跑来就干的“游击队员”。各工厂企业在完成自己的工作任务后，就把载重汽车和挖土机送到“拉兹玛尼奥什”来参加义务劳动。劳动工具缺乏，工厂企业也自动帮助解决。很多居民都是自己带着工具来干。“奥利翁”广播器材工厂的职工还在这辽阔的工地上装置了扩音器，使人们随时可以收听广播。
    目前建设的进度远远超过了预定的指标。明年春天，工业博览会的重工业部分便可在这里展出。用不着三年，人们将以惊奇的眼光来欣赏这个垃圾场上的一切，“拉兹玛尼奥什”将成为布达佩斯的骄傲。
    无边沼泽变良田
    谈到义务劳动，人们常提起青年们征服汉沙格沼泽地的创举。汉沙格是匈牙利西部吉厄尔—索普伦州的一片沼泽地，面积约五十万亩。多少世纪以来，积水一直霸占着这片肥沃的土地。难道人们在大自然的面前真是软弱无能吗？不！匈牙利的青年们发出了嘹亮的声音：“要战胜大自然，要把沼泽变良田！”
    1958年夏天，共青团中央组织了三千多自愿参加征服汉沙格的义务劳动的青年学生，在这里架起了帐篷，摆开了阵线，第一次大规模地向汉沙格展开了进攻。团中央的很多干部也亲自参加了劳动。附近的工人和农民也纷纷赶来积极支持青年们的大胆创举。在短短的暑期中，他们共挖了九万公方土，开出了一条长达两万八千五百多米的排水沟。使十三万亩的荒野变成了良田，并使大片的地区可以牧放牲畜。
    征服汉沙格的队伍在1959年暑期更加壮大了，有近五千人参加了这一工作。他们又在两万四千亩的沼泽地上排除了积水，并且翻了十万多立方米的泥土，挖成一条长达二十四公里的水道。据统计，1959年夏天，青年们在这里完成了价值达一百五十多万福林（匈币名）的义务劳动。
    今年夏天，青年们参加劳动的人数和他们所完成的劳动成绩又比去年翻了一番。
    青年们的干劲很足，每天清早六点钟，他们就迎着晨曦，一个个生龙活虎地奔出帐篷，肩起铁锹和镐头，排着整齐的队伍，奔向工地去挖渠排水，掘大水道。小伙子们在烈日的照耀下，光着膀子干。深达膝盖的泥泞，刺人的芦苇和野草都阻挡不住劳动志愿军的挺进。
    仅仅三个夏天，汉沙格的面貌就大变了。往日的沼泽变成一片片的良田，碧绿的原野上是一群群的牛羊。
    暑期义务劳动的伟大意义，远远不仅限于这些经济利益。当一个个晒得红红的小伙子和姑娘们返回家庭和学校时，他们的思想和情感也发生了很大的变化。他们亲身体验了劳动的生活，提高了对劳动的伟大意义的认识。他们在同大自然的斗争中加强了集体主义精神，学习的劲头也更足了。
    匈牙利的朋友们都满怀信心地说：汉沙格一定会完全和彻底征服，往年的荒地上将出现一片片庄稼、果林、美丽的乡村、楼房和花园。
    同心合力加速社会主义建设
    为加速社会主义建设，广大群众在城市、乡村、工厂和矿区都以多种多样的形式贡献出自己的力量。
    仅布达佩斯去年就有十六万人参加了义务劳动。完成了价值达三千五百万福林的工作。今年全市居民提出要完成价值四千四百万福林的工作。他们用义务劳动建筑了新的学校、文化宫和体育场，开辟了新的花园，铺平了新的道路。第九区的居民还自己捐献资金，为孩子们建筑了一座少先宫。
    新兴钢都斯大林瓦罗什十年来不断发展、扩大。广大群众利用业余时间修体育场，建儿童快乐公园，种树栽花，不久前又开辟了一个大型的城市公园。今天，斯大林瓦罗什不仅是重工业的基地，而且是一个非常清洁、整齐和漂亮的城市。
    包尔绍德纳达日德煤区的职工们用义务劳动帮助建设矿井。切佩尔钢铁厂的青年工人一致决定参加一万五千小时的义务劳动来提前完成变压器厂的建筑工程。他们还利用业余时间制成了一个推运热软钢材的车子。切佩尔发电厂的职工发起了一个“共产主义星期日”运动，在星期日用义务劳动为新厂房装配电线。
    为支援农业合作社和发展农业生产，各工厂企业都同合作社建立了固定的联系，职工们经常利用业余时间到农村帮助农民修建畜舍、安装电灯、修理机器，农忙时帮助农民收割。列宁钢铁厂的青年轧钢工人今年农忙时到附近的农业合作社义务劳动了一万多小时。各地的“青年建筑队”到今年年底将用义务劳动为农业生产合作社修建一百多个牛棚。
    今年暑期共有两万一千多名青年学生参加义务劳动。除参加征服汉沙格的斗争之外，还有一千二百多名青年在哈伊杜—比哈尔冲把五百五十公顷沼泽地改变成良田。有近三千名大中学生参加了多瑙水泥厂的建筑工作。有五千多位姑娘暑期组织了七个劳动营到乡村参加了农业生产。现在佩奇大学正在扩建，该校学生在课余时间都积极参加义务劳动。
    少先队员也不甘落后，他们常展开全国性的收集废铁和废纸运动。仅多尔诺州少先队员在去冬和今春的几个月中，就收集了七万公斤废铁，给农民叔叔制造了十四台拖拉机。（附图片）
