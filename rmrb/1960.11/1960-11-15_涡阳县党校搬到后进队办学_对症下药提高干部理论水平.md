Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 13th: The Communist Party School of Woyang County, Anhui Province, has moved to operate in backward teams. This is a new measure taken in the context of a large number of cadres going deep into the front lines.

In the process of running the school in backward teams, the Party School teaching staff first went deep among the masses to conduct thorough investigations and research. Aiming at the ideological problems existing in the backward teams, they adopted the method of "prescribing the right medicine for the disease," compiling teaching materials on the spot and conducting theoretical education. For example, when they went to the Shifosi Brigade, a backward brigade in Caoshi Commune, they found that a few cadres had ideological problems such as poor foundations and difficulty in changing the situation. The Party School teaching staff explained the truth that contradictions can be transformed when lecturing on "On Contradiction," inspiring cadres to give play to their subjective initiative, establish the ambition to change the situation, and create conditions to change backwardness into advancement. The teaching staff who ran the school in this brigade also collected real people and real events in the local area to compile teaching materials, so that theoretical education was more closely linked to reality. For example, when they talked about "caring for the masses' lives and paying attention to work methods," they used the facts of two production team leaders in this brigade as examples. Gao Guangyi, the production team leader of Xiaogaozhuang, took simultaneous care of production and life, consulted with the masses in everything when leading production, and took the lead in everything. Everyone called him a "good cadre who can't stay idle" and "can come up with ideas," so the production was advanced. However, Fu Guang'en, the production team leader of Wangzhuang, was very energetic, but did not pay attention to work methods, so the production was worse than that of the Xiaogaozhuang production team. In this way, the students deepened their understanding of improving work methods. The Party School's teaching work is closely integrated with the Party's central work. For example, when teaching at the Sunlou Brigade of Chengguan Commune, the central task at that time was to do a good job in the summer grain procurement. The school immediately added lectures on correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, so that this brigade completed the grain procurement task eight days ahead of schedule.

In terms of teaching methods and time arrangements, flexible arrangements are also made according to the needs of production. A combination of centralized and decentralized methods is adopted, with less lectures on sunny days and more on rainy days, learning at night while producing during the day, and learning while doing. The teaching staff not only lectured in the classroom, but also took the students to the fields, lecturing while working. The teaching staff usually went deep into the fields, participating in production and providing guidance at the same time.

The county Party School's move to operate in backward teams has improved the theoretical level and work ability of the cadres in the backward teams, so that the Party's policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing in an all-round way" and "developing the national economy should be based on agriculture" can be better implemented in these backward teams, thus rapidly changing the backward situation. Taking the Shifosi Brigade as an example, 90% of the canteens were rated as advanced canteens by the commune, and the labor attendance rate increased from 80% to 97%. The sown area of autumn crops increased by 7,228 mu compared with last year. The management of autumn fields has always maintained the standard of no weeds, no missing seedlings, no diseases and insect pests, no third-class seedlings, and no idle land. The yield per mu of the 1,500 mu of autumn grain crops that have been harvested has greatly increased compared with last year.

### 涡阳县党校搬到后进队办学  对症下药提高干部理论水平

    涡阳县党校搬到后进队办学
    对症下药提高干部理论水平
    据新华社合肥13日电　安徽省涡阳县中共党校搬到后进队去办学，这是在大批干部深入到第一线的情况下采取的一项新措施。
    在后进队办学过程中，党校教学人员首先深入群众，认真调查研究，针对后进队存在的思想问题，采取“对症下药”的方法，就地编教材，进行理论教育。如他们到曹市公社后进的石佛寺大队，发现有少数干部认为基础差，很难改变面貌等思想问题后，党校教学人员就在讲解“矛盾论”时，通过阐述矛盾可以转化的真理，启发干部发挥主观能动性，树立改变面貌的雄心壮志，创造条件，把后进改变为先进。到这个大队办学的教学人员还收集当地真人真事编写教材，使理论教育更密切联系实际。如他们在讲“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”时，就用这个大队两个生产队长的事实作为例子。小高庄生产队长高广义采取生产、生活一齐抓，领导生产时处处同群众商量，事事带头，大家称他“闲不住”、“会出点子的好干部”，所以生产先进。而王庄生产队长傅广恩，干劲很大，但不注意工作方法，生产就比小高庄生产队差。这样，使学员加深了对改进工作方法的认识。党校的教学工作都密切结合党的中心工作进行。如在城关公社孙娄大队教学时，当时中心工作是搞好夏粮征购，学校立即加讲了正确处理国家、集体和个人的关系，使这个大队提前八天完成了粮食征购任务。
    在讲课的方法和时间的安排上，也根据生产的需要灵活地安排。采取了集中与分散相结合，晴天少讲雨天多讲，白天生产晚上学习，边学边做等方法，教学人员不仅在课堂上讲课，还把学员带到田间地头，边劳动边讲。教学人员平时也深入田间，边参加生产，边进行辅导。
    这个县党校搬到后进队去办学，提高了后进队干部的理论水平和工作能力，使党的“以粮为纲、全面发展”和“发展国民经济应以农业为基础”的方针在这些后进队得到更好的贯彻，从而迅速改变了后进面貌。以石佛寺大队为例，90％的食堂被公社评为先进食堂，劳动出勤率由80％提高到97％。秋季作物播种面积较去年扩大七千二百二十八亩，秋田管理始终保持无杂草、无缺苗、无病虫害、无三类苗、无闲地的标准，已收的一千五百亩秋粮作物，亩产量较去年有很大提高。
