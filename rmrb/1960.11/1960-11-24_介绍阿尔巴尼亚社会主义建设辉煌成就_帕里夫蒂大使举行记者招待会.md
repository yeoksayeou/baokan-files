Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - To celebrate the 16th anniversary of the liberation of Albania and to welcome the upcoming Fourth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, Albanian Ambassador to China, Parifti, held a press conference at the embassy this afternoon, introducing the brilliant achievements made by the Albanian people in socialist construction under the leadership of the glorious Albanian Labor Party.

　　When introducing the glorious history of the Albanian people's revolutionary struggle to the journalists of the capital who attended the reception, Parifti spoke of the glory and greatness of the Albanian Labor Party, pointing out that the Albanian Labor Party, headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, will always hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism in the past, present and future, until the final victory of socialism and communism. He said that our Party, from the day it was founded, has demonstrated that it is a party from the people, which will always defend the interests of the people and the motherland, by its opposition to all enemies, by its perseverance in its work, and by its loyalty to Marxism-Leninism.

　　Parifti said that since the Third Congress of the Party held four years ago, our country has been constantly advancing in building socialism, ensuring the victory of socialism over capitalism, and socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture are underway, while the cultural revolution is also being carried out extensively. The industrial production passed by the Third Party Congress has been completed one year ahead of schedule. The task originally scheduled to be completed by the end of 1960, the last year of the Second Five-Year Plan, was completed in 1959. The total industrial output in 1960 will be 113% more than in 1955, while the figure decided by the Third Party Congress was only 92%. The average annual growth rate is 16.3%, while the growth rate stipulated by the Third Congress was only 14%. Today, agricultural producers' cooperatives account for 85% of the cultivated land area, and their output accounts for 75% of the total output of agriculture and animal husbandry.

　　Parifti said that the Party's Fourth Congress, which will be held in December this year, will approve the instructions for the third five-year plan (1961-1965) for the construction of our motherland. He said that this five-year plan will be a period of rapid development for our country from an agricultural-industrial country to an industrial-agricultural country.

　　Parifti emphasized that we are entering a new stage of developing Albania's economy and culture. The Albanian people are determined to complete the tasks given to them by the Party, and at the same time, they must raise revolutionary vigilance and oppose imperialism, especially US imperialism and its servant, Yugoslav revisionism. Albania is surrounded by greedy enemies, so, as the Labor Party teaches us, we must build socialism with a pick in one hand and a gun in the other.

　　Parifti spoke of the fraternal assistance and support of the Soviet Union, China and other socialist countries to Albania. He said that in every step we take, we can see the deep friendship of the fraternal Chinese people towards the Albanian people. The basis of this friendship is the high Marxist-Leninist principles. Our friendship is constantly developing and growing new leaves.

　　Parifti finally warmly praised the Chinese people for advancing victoriously under the leadership of the correct and wise Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, holding high the three red banners of the Party's General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune. He said that the Chinese people are engaged in an enthusiastic and brave struggle against the poverty and backwardness left over from the past, and we are watching these achievements with infinite excitement.

    介绍阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设辉煌成就
    帕里夫蒂大使举行记者招待会
    新华社23日讯　为庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放十六周年和迎接即将召开阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第四次代表大会，阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使帕里夫蒂今天下午在大使馆举行记者招待会，介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民在光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，在社会主义建设中所取得的辉煌成就。
    帕里夫蒂在向出席招待会的首都新闻界人士介绍阿尔巴尼亚人民革命斗争的光荣历史时，谈到了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的光荣和伟大，指出以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在过去、现在和将来，将永远高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，直到社会主义和共产主义的最终胜利。他说，我们的党，从它成立的日子起，就以自己反对一切敌人，以自己工作中的坚毅以及以它对马克思列宁主义的忠诚，表明了它是一个来自人民的党，它永远要保卫人民和祖国的利益。
    帕里夫蒂说，从四年前举行的党第三次代表大会以来，我们的国家在建设社会主义方面不断地前进，保证了社会主义战胜资本主义，国内社会主义工业化、农业的社会主义改造在进行，同时文化革命也在广泛地进行。第三次党代表大会通过的工业生产已提前一年完成了，原规定在1960年底即第二个五年计划最后一年应完成的任务，在1959年完成了。1960年的工业总产量将比1955年多113％，而党第三次代表大会决定增加的数字只有92％。每年平均增长速度是16.3％，而第三次代表大会规定的增长速度仅14％。今天，农业生产合作社已占耕地面积的85％，其产量已占农业和畜牧业总产量的75％。
    帕里夫蒂说，即将在今年12月召开的党的第四次代表大会，将要批准我们祖国建设的第三个五年计划（1961—1965）的指示。他说，这一个五年计划，将是我国从一个农业—工业国变成一个工业—农业国的迅速发展的时期。
    帕里夫蒂强调指出，我们正进入一个发展阿尔巴尼亚经济和文化的新阶段，阿尔巴尼亚人民决心完成党给予他的任务，同时也要提高革命警惕，反对帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义及其仆从南斯拉夫修正主义。阿尔巴尼亚受着贪欲的敌人的包围，所以像劳动党教导我们那样，要一手拿着镐，一手拿着枪建设社会主义。
    帕里夫蒂谈到了苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家对阿尔巴尼亚的兄弟援助和支持。他说，我们走的每一步路中都可以看到兄弟中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚人民深切的友谊，这一友谊的基础是高度的马克思列宁主义原则。我们的友谊正在不断的发展，正在长出新的叶子。
    帕里夫蒂最后热情称颂中国人民在正确的英明的中国共产党和毛泽东同志的领导下，正高举党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗胜利前进。他说，中国人民正在和过去遗留下来的贫困和落后作热情的勇敢的斗争，我们以无限的兴奋注视到这些成就。
