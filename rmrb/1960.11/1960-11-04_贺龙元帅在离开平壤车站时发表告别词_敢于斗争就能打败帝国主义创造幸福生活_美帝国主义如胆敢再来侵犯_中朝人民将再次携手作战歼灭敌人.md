Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd. Marshal He Long, head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation to Korea, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council of China, and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a farewell speech at Pyongyang Station this morning. The full text is as follows: Dear Comrade Kim Kwang-hyop, dear comrades, and friends:

    We, the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, with infinite reluctance, bid farewell to the leading comrades of the Party and state of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the leading comrades of the Korean People's Army, and the heroic people of Pyongyang. Since arriving in your beautiful country, we have been surrounded by a warm and friendly atmosphere, and have felt as happy as if we were at home. We have been met with unforgettable warm welcomes and meticulous care everywhere. General Luo Ruiqing and all members of the delegation and I are deeply moved, and I would like to take this opportunity to once again express our sincere gratitude to you, and through you, to the Korean people and army!

    Over the past ten days, we have had the honor of being received by Comrade Kim Il-sung and leading comrades of the Korean Workers' Party, government, social organizations, and the army; we have visited factories, rural areas, and military units, and have had cordial and friendly conversations with numerous Korean workers, peasants, and comrades-in-arms of the People's Army; we have also enjoyed your rich, colorful, and superb artistic performances. We are very pleased to see that the hardworking and courageous Korean people, who have embarked on the Chollima Movement, have achieved remarkable success on all fronts of socialist construction under the leadership of the Workers' Party and Comrade Kim Il-sung. At present, all the Korean people are full of confidence and are looking forward to the upcoming Seven-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, which will begin in 1961. The shining example of the Korean people resisting imperialist aggression headed by the United States and building their own country powerfully demonstrates to the people of the world that as long as people dare to rise up and wage a resolute struggle against imperialist aggressors, they will not only be able to defeat any seemingly powerful enemy, but also be able to create a better and happier new life. We regard every victory achieved by the heroic Korean people and army as our own victory, and we are sincerely delighted and hereby extend our heartfelt brotherly congratulations to you!

    Dear comrades, friends: This friendly visit to Korea has once again given us a vivid education in proletarian internationalism. We have seen with our own eyes that the Korean people, under the instruction of the Korean Workers' Party, have made noble sacrifices to defend the cause of peace and socialism; and have expressed great proletarian brotherhood towards the Chinese people and army. Our delegation came with the deep friendship of the Chinese people and army, and now we will return laden with the deep friendship of the Korean people and army. We firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, forged in blood, will be increasingly consolidated and developed, and will be passed on from generation to generation. It will be as solid as the Moranbong Peak, and unbreakable; as the Taedong River, flowing endlessly and eternally. If U.S. imperialism dares to invade us again, in order to defend the common security of our two countries, our two peoples will surely join hands again to fight and give the aggressors a devastating blow. Let our two peoples and armies always unite together, and march forward shoulder to shoulder on the bright road of safeguarding peace, building socialism and communism!

    Long live the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army!

    Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean people and armies!

    Long live the great unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

    Long live world peace!

    贺龙元帅在离开平壤车站时发表告别词
    敢于斗争就能打败帝国主义创造幸福生活
    美帝国主义如胆敢再来侵犯　中朝人民将再次携手作战歼灭敌人
    新华社平壤3日电　中国访朝军事友好代表团团长、中国国防委员会副主席、国务院副总理贺龙元帅今天早晨在离开平壤车站时的告别词，全文如下：亲爱的金光侠同志，亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们，中国军事友好代表团，怀着无限惜别的心情，向以金日成同志为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的党和国家的领导同志、朝鲜人民军的领导同志和英雄的平壤市人民告别。自从来到你们美丽的国家之后，我们就一直被热情、温暖的气氛所包围，像生活在自己的家里一样愉快。我们到处受到令人难忘的热烈的欢迎和无微不至的关怀。我和罗瑞卿大将以及代表团的全体成员都深为感动，我愿借此机会再一次向你们，并通过你们向朝鲜人民和军队，致以诚恳的谢意！
    十多天来，我们荣幸地受到了金日成同志和朝鲜劳动党、政府、社会人士以及军队领导同志的接见；参观访问了工厂、农村和部队，同众多的朝鲜工人、农民和人民军战友们进行了亲切友好的交谈；还欣赏了你们丰富多采、技艺超群的艺术表演。我们十分高兴地看到，跨上了千里马的勤劳、勇敢的朝鲜人民，在劳动党和金日成同志的领导下，在社会主义建设的各个战线上，都取得了惊人的成就。目前，全体朝鲜人民又在充满着信心，迎接即将于1961年开始的人民经济发展七年计划。朝鲜人民反抗以美国为首的帝国主义侵略，建设自己国家的光辉范例，向全世界人民有力地表明：只要人们敢于起来同帝国主义侵略者进行坚决的斗争，就不但能够打败任何貌似强大的敌人，而且也能够创造出更为美好、更为幸福的新生活。我们把英雄的朝鲜人民和军队所取得的每一个胜利都看作如同自己的胜利一样，感到由衷的喜悦，并在此向你们致以发自内心的兄弟般的祝贺！
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们：这次在朝鲜的友好访问，使我们又一次受到了生动的无产阶级国际主义教育，我们亲眼看到，在朝鲜劳动党教导下的朝鲜人民，对保卫和平和社会主义事业作出了崇高的牺牲；对中国人民和军队更表示了伟大的无产阶级的兄弟情谊。我们代表团曾经是带着中国人民和军队的深情厚谊而来，现在又将满载朝鲜人民和军队的深情厚谊而归。我们完全相信，以鲜血凝成的中朝两国人民之间的友谊，必将日益巩固和发展，必将子子孙孙、世世代代地留传下去。它将像牡丹峰一样，坚如磐石，牢不可破；像大同江一样，长流不息，与世永存。如果美帝国主义胆敢再来侵犯我们，为了保卫两国共同的安全，我们两国人民一定会再一次携手作战，给侵略者以毁灭性的打击。让我们两国人民和军队，永远地团结在一起，在保卫和平、建设社会主义和共产主义的光明大道上，昂首阔步，并肩前进！
    英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军万岁！
    中朝两国人民和军队之间的永恒友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的伟大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
