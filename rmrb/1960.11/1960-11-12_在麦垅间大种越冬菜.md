    Mass Planting of Winter Vegetables Between Wheat Rows
    Some members of the Nanguan and Xishe Management Areas of the Chengguan People's Commune in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, believed that the contradiction of wheat and vegetables competing for land would be difficult to resolve this year due to the large wheat fields. The commune Party committee learned that these two management areas had previously planted vegetables on the ridges of wheat fields, so they organized the members to discuss: Could some vegetables be planted on the ridges of the wheat fields? Through discussion, the members summarized the experience of intercropping winter vegetables in wheat field ridges, believing that the nutrients absorbed by vegetables and wheat are different, and intercropping vegetables in wheat fields not only does not affect wheat growth, but also plays a role in loosening the soil and weeding, which is beneficial to wheat seedling growth. Next spring, after harvesting the vegetables, it will not delay intercropping corn. With a method for increasing winter vegetable production, the production teams quickly launched a multi-planting winter vegetable campaign. In ten days, the two management areas intercropped more than 1,300 mu of winter vegetables.

    在麦垅间大种越冬菜
    山西闻喜县城关公社的南关、西社两个管理区有的社员认为今年麦田多，麦菜争地的矛盾不好解决。公社党委了解到这两个管理区往年都曾经利用麦田垅背种菜，就组织社员讨论：能不能在麦田的垅背上种一些菜？通过讨论，社员们总结出麦田垅背套种冬菜的经验，认为菜和麦吸收的养分不同，麦地套种蔬菜不但不影响小麦生长，反而起松土除草的作用，有利麦苗生长，明年春天，收了蔬菜以后，并不耽误套种玉米。增产冬菜有了办法，各生产队很快开展起多种冬菜的活动，两个管理区在十天里就套种了冬菜一千三百多亩。
