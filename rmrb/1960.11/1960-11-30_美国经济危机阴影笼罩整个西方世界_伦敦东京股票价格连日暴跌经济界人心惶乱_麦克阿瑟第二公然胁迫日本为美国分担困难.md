Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch: London stock market prices have been falling sharply for days.

Stock prices began to decline generally from Wednesday evening of last week. The decline on Friday was the most serious in months, leading to it being called "ominous Friday" in the London Stock Exchange. But after the weekend, there was another "ominous Monday" yesterday.

According to London newspapers, stock prices fell across the board yesterday, covering major industries such as industry, banking, insurance, and real estate. The only stocks that remained stable were gold stocks, due to recent increases in gold prices. Industrial stock prices fell the most, averaging about 2% in one day. If calculated from Wednesday of last week, industrial stock prices have fallen by 5%. Reuters described the market situation, saying, "In a market troubled by domestic and foreign economic prospects," "hundreds of millions of pounds of value were slashed from stocks" in one day.

The *Financial Times* commented on the sharp drop in stock prices on the 25th, saying that the characteristic of the current situation is "almost complete lack of buyers." The newspaper said that the increasing difficulty of the British export market and the government's implementation of a tight credit policy have had a "wide impact" on the current situation, and the slump in the automotive, electrical, and consumer goods industries has "strengthened this unease."

Japanese stock prices have also been falling sharply recently. On the 28th, the average stock price in Tokyo fell to 1,266.31 yen, a decrease of 27.9 yen from the 26th. Kyodo News Agency said: "The fact that the United States' gold reserves fell below 18 billion US dollars for the first time in twenty years is the main factor contributing to the decline in stock prices."

An Associated Press dispatch from New York today believes that the sharp drop in stock market prices in London and Tokyo is related to the US government's measures to tighten overseas spending. The dispatch pointed out that people are worried that these measures taken by the United States will greatly affect the industry and commerce of other capitalist countries, and "people speculate that the new US government may be more aggressive in cutting dollar spending overseas than the current government."

Xinhua News Agency, 29th Dispatch: Tokyo News: In order to resolve its serious international payment crisis, the United States is putting pressure on Japan. In addition to forcing Japan to implement trade "liberalization" and other measures, it is also openly demanding that Japan bear more of the "aid" expenses for promoting the US aggression plan.

Associated Press reported today that US Ambassador to Japan MacArthur II said: "The United States frankly stated on Tuesday that it hopes Japan will help it bear more of the burden of aid to the world's underdeveloped countries." He also said that due to the emergency measures taken by Eisenhower to prevent the outflow of gold, US spending in Japan will also be "somewhat reduced."

According to this American news agency, MacArthur II said at a luncheon held by the Fukuoka Japan-America Society that the United States needs this "help" from Japan because the United States' gold reserves have gradually been depleted recently due to the huge US "aid" program. MacArthur II emphasized that Japan should increase its "international responsibilities."

Japanese economic circles are already uneasy about these measures taken by the United States to shift the economic crisis.

Kyodo News Agency said: In order to overcome the dollar crisis, the United States "is exerting strong pressure," hoping that Japan will implement trade "liberalization" as soon as possible in order to further increase exports to Japan.

This news agency pointed out that the United States "also wants to export surplus agricultural products to (Japan) at low prices," and "during activities such as (US) Secretary of Agriculture Benson's visit to Japan, the United States expressed its hope to sell surplus agricultural products to Japan, which is a fact."

Kyodo News Agency also said that the United States is also attempting to restore the so-called "defense burden-sharing fee" borne by Japan for supporting US troops stationed in Japan, which in Japan "will cause fierce nationalist resentment, as in the case of West Germany."

    美国经济危机阴影笼罩整个西方世界
    伦敦东京股票价格连日暴跌经济界人心惶乱
    麦克阿瑟第二公然胁迫日本为美国分担困难
    据新华社29日讯　连日来伦敦股票市场价格一再猛跌。
    从上星期三晚上开始，股票价格就普遍下跌。上星期五一天中的下跌，是几个月来最严重的一次，因此在伦敦股票交易所中被称为“不祥的星期五”。但是过了周末以后，昨天又出现了一个“不祥的星期一”。
    据伦敦报纸报道，昨天一天中股票价格普遍下跌，范围包括工业、银行、保险、地产等主要行业的股票，唯一还保持稳定的是金矿股票，这是因为近来黄金价格在上涨的缘故。工业股票价格下跌最多，一天中平均下降了约2％，如果从上星期三起计算，工业股票价格已下跌了5％。路透社形容市场的情况说，“在一个被国内外经济前景困惑的市场上”，一天之内“几亿英镑的价值从股票上被砍掉了”。
    《金融时报》25日就股票价格急剧下跌发表评论说，目前局势的特点就是几乎完全没有买主”。报纸说，英国出口市场日益艰难以及政府实行贷款紧缩政策，对目前局势发生了“广泛影响”，汽车、电气和消费品工业等的不景气“加强了这种不安情绪”。
    日本的股票价格最近也连续暴跌。在28日这一天，东京的平均股票价格就下跌到一千二百六十六点三一日元，比26日下跌二十七点九日元。共同社说：“美国黄金储备在二十年来第一次下降到一百八十亿美元以下这个事实，是促使股票价格下跌的主要因素”。
    美联社今天从纽约发出的一则消息认为，伦敦和东京的股票市场的价格大跌，是同美国政府紧缩海外开支的措施有关的。消息指出，人们担心美国采取这些措施将大大影响其他资本主义国家的工商业，“人们揣测，美国新政府在削减海外的美元开支方面可能做得比现政府更凶”。
    据新华社29日讯　东京消息：美国为了解救其严重的国际支付危机，正在对日本施加压力。它除迫使日本实行贸易“自由化”等措施外，同时还公开要求日本承担更多为了推行美国侵略计划的“援助”费用。
    美联社今天报道美国驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二的谈话说：“美国星期二直率地说它希望日本帮助它承受更多的对世界不发达国家的援助负担”。他还说，由于艾森豪威尔采取的防止黄金外流的紧急措施，美国在日本的开支也将“有一些削减”。
    据这家美国通讯社报道，麦克阿瑟第二在福冈日美协会举行的午餐会上说，美国需要日本的这种“帮助”是因为美国的黄金储备由于庞大的美国“援助”计划已经在最近渐渐枯竭。麦克阿瑟第二强调，日本应增加它的“国际责任”。
    日本经济界已对美国这些转嫁经济危机的措施惴惴不安。
    共同社说：美国为了克服美元危机，“正在施加强大的压力”，希望日本早日实行贸易“自由化”，以便进一步增加向日本的出口额。
    这家通讯社指出，美国“还想（向日本）廉价输出剩余农产品”，“在（美国）农业部长本逊访日等活动中，美国表示希望把剩余农产品卖给日本，这是事实”。
    共同社并且说，美国还企图恢复日本承担的供养驻日美军的所谓“防御分担费”，这在日本“会和西德的情况一样，引起民族主义的激烈反感”。
