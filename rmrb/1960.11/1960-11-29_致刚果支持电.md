Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Telegram of support to the Congo from the People of the Capital at the rally supporting the Congolese and African People in their struggle for and to maintain national independence and against imperialist aggression. The full text is as follows: To Prime Minister Lumumba of the Central Government of the Republic of the Congo,

    On the occasion of the "Congo Day" held by the Asian and African people, the people of the capital of the People's Republic of China solemnly gather to express our firmest support and fraternal respect to Your Excellency the Prime Minister, and to the Congolese people who are heroically struggling against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and to defend national independence.

    After the Congo achieved independent status, the most vicious U.S. imperialism, under the banner of the United Nations, massively invaded the Congo, disarmed the Congo, prevented the legitimate government of the Congo from exercising its power, suppressed the patriotic struggle of the Congolese people, and instigated conspiracies to split the Congo and subvert the legitimate government of the Congo. Recently, it has even used the current session of the United Nations General Assembly, which it manipulates, to brazenly and shamelessly refuse to accept the delegation sent by the legitimate government of the Congo to attend the assembly. It is clear that U.S. imperialism is deliberately trying to strangle the legitimate government of the Congo, which is determined to maintain national independence, and to extinguish the Congolese people's struggle to maintain national independence, so that American colonialism can replace Belgian colonialism, in order to achieve the goal of swallowing the Congo and enslaving the Congolese people. The Chinese people strongly condemn the crimes of U.S. imperialism in invading and interfering in the Congo.

    We are pleased to see that the patriotic people in all regions of the Congo are rising up and fighting heroically to resist U.S. imperialist aggression, to defend national independence, and to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity. We express to Your Excellency and the Congolese people that the Chinese people will always stand by the Congolese people, fully support the patriotic and just struggle of the Congolese people, and resolutely support the legitimate government led by Your Excellency that firmly defends Congolese independence. Although the Congolese people may encounter temporary setbacks and difficulties in the struggle to maintain national independence and unity, justice is on the side of the Congolese people, and the African people and all the oppressed nations and oppressed people of the world support the Congolese people. We firmly believe that the Congolese people, who are unyielding and determined to fight, will surely drive all imperialist forces headed by the United States out of the Congo and win the complete victory of national liberation.

              The People of the Capital of the People's Republic of China at the
              Rally Supporting the Congolese and African People in their
              Struggle for and to Maintain National Independence and
              Against Imperialist Aggression
                                    November 28, 1960, Beijing

    致刚果支持电
    新华社28日讯　首都各界人民支持刚果和非洲人民争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义侵略大会致刚果支持电。全文如下：刚果共和国中央政府卢蒙巴总理
    在亚非人民举行“刚果日”的时候，中华人民共和国首都各界人民隆重集会，向总理阁下，并向为反对美帝国主义侵略，保卫民族独立而英勇斗争的刚果人民表示最坚决的支持和兄弟的敬意。
    在刚果取得独立地位之后，穷凶极恶的美帝国主义打着联合国的旗号，大举侵入刚果，解除刚果的武装，阻止刚果合法政府行使权力，镇压刚果人民的爱国斗争，策动分裂刚果和颠复刚果合法政府的阴谋活动，最近更利用由它操纵的本届联合国大会，横蛮无耻地拒绝接受刚果合法政府派遣的代表团出席大会。很明显，美帝国主义蓄意要扼杀坚决维护民族独立的刚果合法政府，扑灭刚果人民维护民族独立的斗争，由美国殖民主义代替比利时殖民主义，以达鲸吞刚果和奴役刚果人民的目的。中国人民强烈谴责美帝国主义侵略干涉刚果的罪行。
    我们高兴地看到刚果各地区爱国人民正在奋起，为抗击美国帝国主义侵略，为保卫民族独立，维护主权和领土完整而英勇斗争。我们向阁下和刚果人民表示，中国人民将永远站在刚果人民一边，全力支持刚果人民的爱国正义斗争，坚决支持总理阁下领导的坚决维护刚果独立的合法政府。尽管刚果人民在维护民族独立和统一的斗争中，还会遇到暂时的曲折和困难，但正义在刚果人民一边，非洲人民和全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民都支持刚果人民。我们深信，不屈不挠坚决斗争的刚果人民一定能够把以美国为首的一切帝国主义势力从刚果赶出去，获得民族解放的彻底胜利。
              中华人民共和国首都各界人民支持刚果和非洲人
              民争取和维护民族独立、反对帝国主义侵略大会
