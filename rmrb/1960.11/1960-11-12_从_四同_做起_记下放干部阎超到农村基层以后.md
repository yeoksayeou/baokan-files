    Starting with "Four Togethers"
    ——On the Downward-Transferred Cadre Yan Chao After Arriving in the Rural Grassroots
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Ji Hede

    One morning, we set off from Fengtai County, Anhui, and walked more than fifty li along the north bank of the Huai River to reach the Wuji Production Brigade of Limiao Commune. The brigade office was quiet. A comrade told us: The newly arrived brigade Party Branch Secretary has gone to the fields to work. As we walked out of the brigade office, a middle-aged man came over from the ridge not far opposite. He was wearing a straw hat, dressed in a faded gray cloth suit, with his trouser legs rolled up high. He had a manure basket slung over his left shoulder, with a sickle stuck on the rattan handle of the basket. After he poured the manure, which was full in the basket, into the manure pool, he came up to shake hands with us. The Commune Party Committee Secretary introduced him to us, and we learned that he was Comrade Yan Chao, whom we were to interview.

    Yan Chao was originally the Deputy Director of the Finance and Trade Department of the Fengtai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. He was transferred to this brigade to serve as the Party Branch Secretary in late July this year. After arriving in the brigade, he quickly won the trust of the commune members by starting with eating, living, working, and consulting with them, and they praised him as a "Four Togethers" cadre.

    Wuji Brigade is located in the lake depression area where the three counties of Mengcheng, Huaiyuan, and Fengtai meet. The land is barren, there is a lot of land and few people, and it is one of the poorer brigades in the county. Yan Chao came here with a fiery heart, determined to use his exemplary actions to motivate the masses and change the poor appearance here. After arriving at the brigade, he immediately went to the fields to operate waterwheels, weed, and deliver manure. During the labor, he found that some cadres and commune members believed that the soil was not good and lacked confidence in improving production. He thought: Confidence is the power to overcome all difficulties. To change the poor appearance here, we must first build up the confidence of the masses, which requires strengthening ideological education for the masses. Therefore, on the one hand, he publicized to the commune members the importance of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production and the Party's various policies. At the same time, he collected good and bad crops grown in the bad land of each team and organized a physical exhibition in the brigade, organizing all the commune members of the brigade to visit and discuss. Through the exhibition and discussion, the commune members were all clear in their minds. They said: "It's not that crops don't grow in bad land, but that manure is not applied." After the commune members' ideological understanding was improved, Yan Chao again took the lead in mobilizing everyone to vigorously accumulate fertilizer. Every morning at the first crow of the rooster, he got out of bed, draped himself in clothes, and went everywhere to pick up manure with a manure basket. Whether he was going to the commune for meetings or going to the fields to work, he always had a manure basket with him. He borrowed a manure vat and dug a fertilizer pit, pouring the manure he accumulated and the artemisia that he cut, load by load, into it. Over time, in more than two months, he filled the manure vat and the fertilizer pit. On the day the manure was taken out, the commune members pulled out a full twenty large carts.

    Once, the brigade held a meeting of production team Party branch secretaries and team leaders. After everyone arrived, Yan Chao suggested that everyone take advantage of the good morning time to pick up a basket of manure before returning to the meeting. After he finished speaking, he casually slung a manure basket and went out. Some production team cadres, because they did not usually have the habit of accumulating fertilizer, did not bring manure baskets. Seeing Secretary Yan doing this, they all looked ashamed and said that they would definitely learn from Secretary Yan. From then on, every time the brigade held a meeting of small team cadres, the doorway was always lined with manure baskets. Under the influence of the cadres, the commune members also slung up manure baskets, setting off a surge of fertilizer accumulation. In just one month, the entire brigade accumulated more than 1.8 million dan of fertilizer, meeting the fertilizer needs of 9,000 mu of summer crops.

    Yan Chao humbly learns from the masses in his work and consults with them on everything. He often says: "If you believe in the masses, the masses will believe in you. Only by working and living with them can you become one with them and make close friends." When he first came to Wuji Brigade, the 9,000 mu of crops in the team were growing thin and yellow. How to make these crops grow well and produce more grain in the absence of fertilizer? One day, while he was working in the Fourth Small Team, he talked about this issue with the old farmers Wu Tingke and Li Quanfu. Wu Tingke told him that autumn crops depend on one hoe. Without manure, as long as you weed diligently, the crops can also grow well. Li Quanfu chimed in and said: "That's right, as long as you clean the weeds and loosen the topsoil, the crops will change every day." According to the experience of the old farmers, Yan Chao immediately mobilized the masses to carry out a weeding competition. In the competition, in accordance with the Party's policy of distribution according to work, after consulting with the commune members, he established a responsibility system, stipulating that male laborers would weed 2.1 mu per day and female laborers 1.5 mu, and pay work points according to the quality of completion, with rewards for exceeding the quota and more pay for more work. The entire brigade spent thirteen days weeding the 9,000 mu of crops once. Four thousand mu of soybean third-class seedlings were quickly upgraded to first-class seedlings after weeding.

    After all 9,000 mu of crops were weeded once, Yan Chao mobilized the masses to turn the soil again. On the first day of turning the soil, he took the lead in going down to the field to plow. At first, he didn't know how, so he asked the commune members for advice. Under his influence, the cadres and masses of the entire team set off a plowing competition. After twenty consecutive days of effort, the entire brigade finally turned over all 6,000 mu of barren land. After the land was plowed and leveled, he went to Mengcheng, Fengtai and other places to purchase more than 3,000 jin of carrot seeds, mobilizing the masses to plant carrots and late autumn crops. One day, he went to Wuqian Production Team to help plant carrots. Some commune members told him that planting carrots too early would burn the seedlings to death, wasting seeds and effort. He immediately asked everyone to stop and asked everyone to come up with ideas. Some commune members suggested that the land be leveled and crushed, and mixed with tall-stalk crops such as sesame and buckwheat. In this way, the tall-stalk crops would emerge quickly and grow tall, which could prevent heat and increase production. Yan Chao solicited the opinions of other commune members, and everyone agreed. Therefore, all 3,100 mu of carrots in the entire brigade adopted this method of mixed planting. Now, the carrots are generally growing well, and the large ones are already more than half a catty. The mixed-planted sesame and buckwheat have also achieved good harvests.

    While grasping production and thought, it is necessary to grasp life, especially to run the canteens well. This is a major event that Yan Chao always keeps in mind. After he came to Wuji Brigade, he ran all over the nine canteens, and whenever he had time, he went to the canteen to help the cooks serve food, and together with the cooks, he studied canteen management and how to improve the quality of meals. With his specific help, all nine canteens in the brigade have established vegetable bases and raised poultry. The commune members can eat an average of three catties of fresh vegetables every day. He insists on eating the same food as the commune members in the same canteen, without any special treatment.

    Because Yan Chao follows the mass line in everything, sets an example everywhere, and insists on implementing the "Four Togethers," the production of this brigade has been thriving in just three months. After setting aside enough rations, seeds, and feed, the entire brigade has overfulfilled this year's grain purchase task. The autumn planting task of more than 100,000 mu has also been completed. In the days when we left the brigade, the commune members were rushing to put the autumn grain into storage with unparalleled enthusiasm, putting 100,000 jin into storage in one day. These are all unprecedented in the history of this brigade.

    从“四同”做起
    ——记下放干部阎超到农村基层以后
    新华社记者　纪和德
    一天早晨，我们从安徽凤台县城出发，沿着淮河北岸步行五十多里，来到了李庙公社武集生产大队。大队办公室里面静悄悄的，一位同志告诉我们：新来的大队总支书记到地里劳动去了。当我们走出大队办公室时，对面不远的田埂上过来了一位中年人，他戴着草帽，穿了一身褪了色的灰布衣服，裤脚卷得老高，左肩挎着一个粪筐，筐上的荆条柄上还插了一把镰刀。他把粪筐里装得满满的粪倒进粪池后，便迎上来和我们握手。经公社党委书记介绍，才知道他就是我们要访问的阎超同志。
    阎超原是中共凤台县委财贸部副部长，今年7月下旬才下放到这个大队担任党总支书记。他到大队以后，首先从和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量做起，很快博得社员的信任，称赞他为“四同干部”。
    武集大队处在蒙城、怀远、凤台三县交界的湖洼地区，土地瘠薄，地多人少，是全县较穷的一个大队。阎超怀着一颗火热的心来到这里，决心以自己的模范行动带动群众，把这里的贫困面貌改变过来。他到大队后刚放下行李，就下地车水、锄草、送粪。在劳动中，他发现部分干部和社员认为土质不好，对搞好生产缺乏信心。他想：信心是克服一切困难的力量，要改变这里的贫困面貌，必须先把群众的信心树立起来，这就需要加强对群众进行思想教育。于是，他一面向社员宣传大办农业、大办粮食的重要意义和党的各项方针政策，同时把各小队坏地里长出来的好的和坏的庄稼收集到大队，办了一个实物展览会，组织全大队社员参观讨论。通过展览和讨论，社员们个个心里亮堂，他们说：“坏地里不是不长庄稼，而是没有上粪。”在社员的思想认识提高以后，阎超又以身作则来带动大家大搞积肥。他每天早晨鸡叫头一遍，就披衣下床，挎着粪筐到处拣粪。不论是到公社开会，还是下地劳动，他身边总是不离粪筐。他借来了一个粪缸，又挖了一个沤肥窖，把自己积的粪和砍的青蒿子，一担一筐的倒在里面。这样日积月累，两个多月就把粪缸和沤肥窖填得满满的，在出粪那一天，社员们整整拉了二十大车。
    有一次，大队召开生产队党支部书记和队长会议。人到齐后，阎超提议大家趁着早上的好时光，先拾一筐粪，然后再回来开会。他说完后便随手挎着粪筐出门了。有些生产队干部因为平时没有积肥习惯，没有带粪筐，看到阎书记这样做都面有愧色，表示一定向阎书记学习。从那以后，大队每次召开小队干部会议时，门口总是成排地摆满了粪筐。社员们也在干部的影响下，都挎起了粪筐，掀起了积肥热潮。在短短的一个月时间内，全大队就积了一百八十多万担肥料，满足了九千亩夏种作物的追肥需要。
    阎超在工作中虚心向群众学习，遇事都和群众商量。他常说：“你相信群众，群众就会相信你，只有和他们一起劳动和生活，这样才能和他们打成一片，交上知心朋友。”在他初来武集大队时，队里有九千亩庄稼长得又瘦又黄。怎样在缺肥的情况下，使这些庄稼长好多打粮食？一天他在四小队劳动时，和老农武廷科、李全甫谈起了这个问题。武廷科告诉他，秋庄稼在于一锄，没有粪，只要勤锄草也能长好庄稼。李全甫接过来说：“对啦，只要把草锄净，墒土刨松，包管庄稼一天一个样儿。”阎超根据老农的经验，立即发动群众开展锄地竞赛。在竞赛中，他按照党的按劳分配政策的精神，在同社员商量以后，建立了责任制，规定男劳力每天二点一亩，女劳力一点五亩，按照完成质量付给工分报酬，超额有奖励，多劳多得。全大队经过十三天的时间，就把九千亩庄稼锄了一遍。四千亩黄豆三类苗，经过锄草以后迅速升为一类苗。
    九千亩庄稼全部锄完一遍草以后，阎超又发动群众翻地。在翻地的第一天，他带头下田犁地。开始不会，他就向社员请教。全队干部和群众在他的影响下，掀起了犁地竞赛。全大队经过连续二十天努力，终于把六千亩荒白地全部翻了一遍，地犁好整平后，他又到蒙城、凤台等地购买了三千多斤胡萝卜种子，发动群众大种胡萝卜和晚秋作物。一天，他到武前生产队帮助种胡萝卜，有些社员向他说，胡萝卜种早了会热死幼苗，浪费种子又白花工夫。他便马上让大家停下来，请大家出主意。有的社员提出，把地整平、整碎，和芝麻、荞麦等高秆作物混种，这样高秆作物出土快长得高，既可防热又可增产。阎超征求其他社员的意见，大家的看法一致。于是，全大队的三千一百多亩胡萝卜全部采用这种办法混种。现在，胡萝卜普遍生长良好，大的已有半斤多重，混种的芝麻、荞麦也都获得了好收成。
    在抓生产、思想的同时要抓生活，特别要办好食堂，这是阎超时刻记在心上的大事。他来到武集大队后，跑遍了九个食堂，一有空就到食堂帮助炊事员打菜打饭，同炊事员一起研究食堂管理工作和如何提高饭菜质量。全大队九个食堂在他的具体帮助下，普遍建立了蔬菜基地，养了家禽，社员们平均每天能吃到三斤新鲜蔬菜。他坚持和社员们在一个食堂吃同样的饭，丝毫也不特殊。
    由于阎超事事走群众路线，处处以身作则，坚持实行“四同”，在短短的三个月时间内，就把这个大队的生产搞得蒸蒸日上。全大队在留足了口粮、种子和饲料以后，已经超额完成了今年征购粮的任务。十万多亩的秋种任务也已经完成。在我们离开大队的那几天，社员们正以无比的热情突击秋粮入库工作，一天就突击入库十万斤。这些都是这个大队历史上从来没有过的。
