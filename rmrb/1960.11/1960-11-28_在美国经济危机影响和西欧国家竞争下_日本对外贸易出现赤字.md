Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th. According to a report in the Japanese newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" on the 26th, citing materials released by the Bank of Japan, Japan's actual trade balance in October of this year showed a deficit of 8 million US dollars for the first time since November of last year. The Bank of Japan admitted that this was the result of the US economic crisis and the intensification of Japan's competition with Western European countries for markets.

The bank also admitted that the Japanese government's plan to achieve a surplus of 600 million US dollars in its international balance of payments this year would be difficult to achieve.

According to this material, Japan's actual exports in October were 308 million US dollars, a sharp decrease of 54 million US dollars compared to September, while actual imports in October were 316 million US dollars, an increase of 11 million US dollars compared to September.

According to reports, with 1958 as 100, Japan's export contract index for October this year was 96, a sharp decrease of 35% compared to 155 in September, with exports of steel and fiber products decreasing by 50% and 30% respectively. However, in contrast, Japan's imports are expected to increase in the future.

According to statistics, the Japanese government approved an average monthly import volume of 328 million US dollars from July to September this year, but this increased to 406 million US dollars in October.

    在美国经济危机影响和西欧国家竞争下
    日本对外贸易出现赤字
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：据日本《读卖新闻》26日援引日本银行公布的材料报道，日本今年10月的贸易实际收支，自从去年11月份以来，第一次出现了八百万美元的赤字。日本银行承认，这是由于美国经济危机和日本同西欧国家争夺市场剧烈化的结果。
    这家银行还承认，日本政府今年企图在国际收支方面获得六亿美元盈余的计划已很难实现。
    根据这项材料，日本贸易在10月的实际输出额为三亿零八百万美元，比9月份激减少了五千四百万美元，而10月份的实际输入额为三亿一千六百万美元，比9月份增加了一千一百万美元。
    据报道，以1958年为一百，日本今年10月的输出合同指数为九十六，比9月份的一百五十五激减了35％，其中钢铁和纤维制品输出分别减少50％和30％。但是，与此相反，预料今后日本的输入还会增加。
    据统计，日本政府在今年7月至9月期间平均每月批准进口额为三亿二千八百万美元，而10月竟增加到四亿六百万美元。
