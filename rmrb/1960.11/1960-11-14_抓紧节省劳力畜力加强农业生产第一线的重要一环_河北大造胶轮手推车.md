Editor's Note: When doing anything, we must grasp the key and the main contradictions. The same applies to supporting agriculture. The same amount of effort yields greater results when focused on the crucial points; dispersed effort, with no distinction between primary and secondary tasks, yields smaller results. One of the important tasks of the industrial front this winter is to prepare for spring plowing in rural areas and to help rural people's communes strive for a bumper harvest next year. Whether this preparation work is done well depends first and foremost on what is being prepared and whether it grasps the most needed things in agriculture at present.

Hebei Province's mass production of rubber-tired handcarts is a good grasp of this key. The rubber-tired handcarts that the province will produce before the end of the year alone can help rural areas save millions of laborers from short-distance transportation and devote them to the main field labor. Rubber-tired handcarts may not be as important to other regions as they are to Hebei Province, but Hebei Province's method of identifying the key and concentrating efforts to solve it conscientiously has universal significance.

Tianjin, November 13th (Report from our newspaper) Hebei Province is vigorously manufacturing and promoting rubber-tired carts (rubber-tired handcarts). After using the new rubber-tired carts, many rural communes have saved a large number of laborers and animal power to be invested in the front line of agricultural production.

In Hebei Province, rural transportation has always occupied a relatively large amount of labor and animal power, which is an important aspect of further tapping labor potential and strengthening field production. The Hebei Provincial Party Committee summarized and analyzed the province's experience in reforming rural tools in the past two or three years, and believes that promoting the use of rubber-tired carts is a faster, better, and more economical way to tap the labor potential of rural transportation. Judging from the use of rubber-tired carts in rural areas of Hebei, rubber-tired carts have four major advantages. First, they can save a large number of laborers and invest them in the front line of agricultural production. Double-wheeled carts can carry 650 kilograms to 1,000 kilograms in plain areas, which can save at least four or five laborers; a single-wheeled cart can save at least one or two strong laborers. In Handan City, double-wheeled carts have been train-operated on relatively flat highways. Two animals pulling four or five carts can carry at least four or five thousand kilograms, saving even more labor. Second, they can save a large number of animal power used for pulling carts and carrying goods. Third, rubber-tired carts have a simple structure and can be mass-produced by county and commune factories with slightly better equipment conditions; as long as there are main parts such as rubber tires and ball bearings, general production team iron and wood groups can assemble them. Fourth, they can be used in mountainous areas and plains, which is convenient for universal promotion.

In September, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee formulated a plan for producing rubber-tired carts. According to the plan, by the end of this year, 740,000 rubber-tired carts will be produced for more than 160,000 production teams in the province, of which 240,000 are double-wheeled carts. These rubber-tired carts can save millions of laborers. The Provincial Party Committee also plans to continue to vigorously produce rubber-tired carts in the next two years, so that each production team in the province will gradually have 15 rubber-tired carts.

Party committees at all levels from cities and counties to communes and relevant factories in Hebei have strengthened their leadership over the production, matching, transportation, and promotion of rubber-tired carts. Under the unified leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the problems of raw materials, materials, equipment, and labor required for the production of rubber-tired carts have been basically solved through overall planning. Tianjin City, which is undertaking the main production task of the first batch of rubber-tired carts, was headed by Zhang Huai-san, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, and responsible comrades of the Municipal Industrial Production Committee, and a special leading group was established. More than 80 factories under the Tianjin Municipal Light Industry Bureau, Metallurgical Industry Bureau, and Agricultural Machinery Industry Bureau organized an unprecedented large-scale collaboration, and everyone worked together to complete the rubber-tired cart production task assigned by the Provincial Party Committee.

The workers of various factories manufacturing rubber-tired carts launched a vigorous labor competition to support the agricultural harvest. The Tianjin Vehicle Factory originally planned to produce 15,000 sets of double-wheeled cart axles and 500,000 sets of single-wheeled cart axles this year. In order to better support agriculture, it also accepted the task of producing 75,000 more sets of double-wheeled cart axles. In order to further improve the quality of the axles and manufacture carts with high load capacity and lightness, the factory also sent people to Handan and other places to solicit the opinions of commune members and changed the hollow axle to a solid axle, which increased the design load capacity of the axle by 300 kilograms. The workers of the Tianjin No. 1 Wheel Factory, which produces spokes and spoke caps for cart wheels, enthusiastically launched a competition and continuously overfulfilled production tasks by ten-day periods and by month. In order to save steel and produce more wheel rims, the workers of the wheel rim workshop of the Tianjin No. 1 Wheel Factory launched a technical revolution. The cold rolling mill they manufactured can produce eight wheel rims with the materials originally used to produce seven. Commercial and transportation departments have also adopted the method of transporting rubber-tired carts to rural areas as they are produced, accelerating the transportation of rubber-tired carts to rural areas. More than 300,000 carts have now been transported to rural areas.

After the new rubber-tired carts were put into rural transportation, they immediately played a great role. In Nangong County, thanks to the use of handcarts in the "Three Autumns" (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing), fertilizer for more than 3,000 mu of land can be transported in one day, freeing up most of the county's more than 5,000 animals for autumn plowing and autumn sowing. The task of sowing 940,000 mu of wheat in the county was basically completed before the frost, half a month earlier than in previous years, and the animal power released also deep-plowed 60,000 mu of land. Yutian County's Baiguan Tun People's Commune added 620 rubber-tired carts this year, which not only completed the transportation task in a timely manner, but also saved a large amount of labor. The commune's 90,000 mu of autumn harvest crops were not only harvested eleven days earlier than last year, but also quickly transported to warehouses.

    抓紧节省劳力畜力加强农业生产第一线的重要一环
    河北大造胶轮手推车
    编者按：做一切事情都要抓关键，抓主要矛盾。支援农业也是这样。同样多的力量，用在节骨眼上收效就大；分散使用，主次不分，效果就小。今年冬天工业战线的重要任务之一，就是为农村春耕生产作准备，为帮助农村人民公社争取明年大丰收作准备。这个准备工作做得好坏，第一条就是看准备的是什么，是不是抓住了当前农业最需要的东西。
    河北省大造胶轮手推车，这个关键就抓得好。这个省仅在年底以前制成的胶轮手推车，就可以帮助农村从短途运输中节约出成百万个劳动力，投入田间主要劳动。胶轮手推车对其他地区来说，不一定像在河北省那样重要，但是，河北省这种看准了关键，集中力量认真解决的方法，却是有普遍意义的。
    本报天津13日电　河北省正在大力制造和推广胶轮力车（胶轮手推车）。许多农村公社使用上新的胶轮力车以后，已经节省出大批劳动力和畜力投入农业生产第一线。
    河北省的农村运输一直占用劳动力和畜力比较多，是当前进一步挖掘劳动潜力加强田间生产的一个重要方面。中共河北省委总结分析了全省近两、三年来改革农村工具的经验，认为推广使用胶轮力车，是挖掘农村运输劳动潜力的一个多快好省的办法。从河北各地农村使用胶轮力车的情况看来，胶轮力车有四大好处。第一，可以节省大批劳动力，投入农业生产第一线。双轮力车在平原地区载重量可达六百五十公斤到一千公斤，至少可以节省四、五个劳动力；一辆单轮力车起码也可以节省一个到两个壮劳动力。邯郸市在比较平坦的公路上实现了双轮力车列车化，两头牲畜拉四、五辆车，至少载运四、五千斤，节省的劳动力更多。第二，可以节省大批用于拉车、驮运的畜力。第三，胶轮力车结构简单，设备条件稍好的县社工厂都能大量生产；只要有了胶轮、滚珠等主要配件，一般生产队的铁木小组就能装配。第四，山区、平原都能使用，便于普遍推广。
    中共河北省委9月间制订了一个生产胶轮力车的规划。按照规划，到今年年底就将为全省十六万多个生产小队生产七十四万辆胶轮力车，其中有二十四万辆是双轮力车。这些胶轮力车可以节省成百万个劳动力。省委还计划在今后两年内继续大力生产胶轮力车，使全省每个生产小队逐步达到有胶轮力车十五辆。
    河北各地从市、县到公社、有关工厂的党委都对胶轮力车的生产、配套、调运和推广使用加强了领导。在省委的统一领导下，经过统筹安排，生产胶轮力车所需要的原料、材料、设备、劳动力等问题，都基本上解决了。承担首批胶轮力车主要生产任务的天津市，由中共天津市委书记处书记张淮三、市委工业生产委员会负责同志挂帅，成立了专门的领导小组；由天津市轻工业局、冶金工业局、农业机械工业局等八个工业局和八十多个工厂，组织了空前规模的大协作，大家群策群力，完成省委下达的胶轮力车生产任务。
    制造胶轮力车的各厂职工为支援农业丰收，展开了热火朝天的劳动竞赛。天津车辆厂今年原计划生产双轮力车大轴一万五千套和单轮力车小轴五十万套，为了更好地支援农业，又接受了多制七万五千套双轮力车大轴的任务。这个厂为了进一步提高大轴的质量，制造载重量大又轻巧的力车，还派人到邯郸等地征求公社社员的意见，把空心轴改成实心轴，使大轴的设计载重量增加了三百公斤。生产力车车轮的车条和条帽的天津第一车具厂的工人们，热烈开展竞赛，连续按旬、按月地超额完成生产任务。天津第一车具厂瓦圈车间的工人们为了节约钢材，多产瓦圈，群起大闹技术革命。他们制造的冷轧机，使原来生产七个瓦圈的用料可以生产八个。商业和交通运输部门也采取随生产、随调运的办法，加速向农村调运胶轮力车，现在已运到农村三十多万辆。
    新胶轮力车投入农村运输以后，立即发挥了很大作用。南宫县在“三秋”中由于手推车上阵，一天能运送三千多亩地的肥料，使全县五千多头牲畜大部分都腾出来投入了秋耕和秋种。全县九十四万亩的种麦任务在霜降前基本完成，比往年提前半个月，腾出的畜力还深翻了六万亩土地。玉田县白关屯人民公社今年增加了六百二十辆胶轮力车，既及时完成了运输任务，又节约了大批劳动力。全社九万亩秋收作物不但比去年提前十一天割完，而且迅速运完入仓。
