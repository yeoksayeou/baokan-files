　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 22nd: Joseph Kiwanuka, Chairman of the Uganda National Congress, told Xinhua reporters here today when they met him, "The Ugandan people are engaged in a fierce struggle against imperialism, and they are determined to continue the struggle until they achieve complete independence."

　　Speaking of the political situation in Uganda, he said that the current political situation in Uganda is very tense. "We must not only fight against the imperialists, but also against the reactionaries and feudal lords." He went on to say that in all East African countries, the imperialists are working hard to plan so that once these countries achieve independence, the control of these countries will be handed over to their lackeys, just as they did in the Congo. He emphasized that the United States is doing everything possible to seize power in these countries.

　　Speaking of the separatist conspiracy in Buganda, he said that it is clear that this new separatist conspiracy is supported by certain countries. Buganda is one of the four largest and most prosperous provinces in Uganda, and the Buganda government has set its own "independence" date. All political parties in Uganda oppose this action.

　　Kiwanuka said that the friendship between the Ugandan and Chinese people is profound. He said, "China has left an impression in the hearts of many Ugandans, because after many delegations visited China and returned to Uganda, they spoke highly of China, thus establishing a solid friendly relationship between the two peoples." Kiwanuka, who has visited China twice, said, "The Chinese are one of the greatest nations in the world, and the progress made by the Chinese people is unprecedented in the entire history of mankind."

　　He emphasized, "China's greatest contribution to the world today is that it has carried out anti-imperialist struggles and sympathizes with any country that is carrying out anti-imperialist struggles, especially African countries."

    基瓦努卡主席对新华社记者说
    乌干达人民决为争取独立斗争到底
    赞扬中国人民坚决反帝和同情各国人民反帝斗争
    新华社开罗22日电　乌干达国民大会主席约瑟夫·基瓦努卡今天在这里接见新华社记者时说：“乌干达人民正在进行反对帝国主义的激烈的斗争，他们决心继续斗争直到取得完全独立为止。”
    他在谈到乌干达的政治局势时说，乌干达目前的政治局势是非常紧张的，“我们不仅要同帝国主义者斗争，而且还要同反动分子和封建主斗争。”他接着说，在所有东非国家里，帝国主义者正在努力策划，以便在这些国家一旦取得独立时把这些国家的控制权交给他们的走狗，就像他们在刚果所做的那样。他强调说，美国正在竭尽一切力量来攫取这些国家的权力。
    他在谈到布干达的分裂主义阴谋时说，很清楚，这种新的分裂主义阴谋是受到某些国家的支持的。布干达是乌干达四个最大的和最富饶的省份之一，布干达政府确定了他们自己的“独立”日期。乌干达的一切政党都反对这个行动。
    基瓦努卡说，乌干达人民和中国人民的友谊是深厚的。他说：“中国在许多乌干达人的心中留下了印象，因为许多代表团在访问中国回到乌干达以后，对中国有很高的评价，从而建立了两国人民的牢固的友好关系。”基瓦努卡曾经两度访问过中国，他说：“中国人是世界上最伟大的民族之一，中国人民取得的进步是整个人类历史上闻所未闻的。”
    他强调说：“中国对今天世界的最大贡献是它进行了反帝斗争，并且同情正在进行反帝斗争的任何国家，特别是非洲国家。”
