Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 26th: According to a Vientiane radio broadcast tonight, the Lao National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unification held a mass rally in Vientiane this afternoon with more than 10,000 people participating. The conference was conducted in an inspiring atmosphere. The participants in the rally unanimously and enthusiastically supported the Phouma government's policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony, and supported the National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unification.

The participants in the rally included monks, government representatives, members of parliament, various parties, patriotic people from all walks of life, students, and youth.

The radio said that Phoui Sananikone, Chairman of the National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unification, gave a report on the policy line and the Lao situation at the meeting. He first reviewed the Lao situation since the military coup launched by the Vientiane garrison, police, and people headed by Captain Kong Le on August 9 and the establishment of the Phouma government, condemned the traitorous crimes of the rebel group in establishing the so-called "Revolutionary Committee" and conducting rebellions in Luang Prabang, and pointed out some of the measures taken by the Phouma government to implement the policy of peace, neutrality, and national harmony. He said, "We still see that in the process of implementing national harmony and peaceful neutrality, there are many difficulties, because foreign interventionists and their running dog traitor groups will continue to obstruct and sabotage. However, whether they can succeed depends entirely on our struggle."

He said that, based on the requirements of the current situation, the National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unification has been announced in order to jointly oppose foreign interventionists and their running dog traitor groups with various parties and all patriotic people, promote the country to embark on the road of peace and neutrality, and implement national harmony and unified country. The sole purpose of establishing this committee is to fight for the interests of the nation and the policy of peaceful neutrality. He continued, "We earnestly call on the people of the capital and the people of the whole country to unite closely, support the Phouma government, and resolutely oppose foreign interventionists and traitor groups. Unity is the backing force for the Royal Government to realize the policy of peace and neutrality and national harmony, and to defend the motherland, religion, the King and the Constitution."

He said that, facing the tense situation, in order to meet the wishes of the people, the National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unification calls on the government to take a firm attitude towards the enemy, accept Soviet assistance as soon as possible, send delegations to China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as soon as possible to conduct economic and cultural exchanges, and demand that the United States immediately stop aiding traitor groups. At the same time, we call on the government and the parliament to disqualify those members who followed the traitor group. The government must take resolute measures to punish those who carry out harassment and discord activities and disrupt the peaceful life of the people in the capital.

He said, "We call on monks, state officials, civil servants, students and people from all walks of life to be vigilant against the enemy's conspiracies of discord, and to cooperate closely with the army and police to defend the capital. This is our important task in the future."

Phoui Sananikone said that the garrisons, police, civil servants, monks, royal family members and people from all walks of life in Luang Prabang and other cities should cooperate closely with the government and the Lao fighting forces to liberate the cities where they live from the control of the traitor group.

Army and police officers and soldiers who have been lured and coerced by the traitor group should immediately break away from the traitor group and turn to the government and the people with a spirit of patriotism. He said: "You will be received as you deserve. You should perform meritorious service to redeem your sins, and do not lose your lives for the traitor group."

He finally said, "Our struggle to guide the motherland on the road of peace, neutrality and national harmony is very arduous. We will encounter many difficulties, and the enemy will vigorously sabotage the progress of our nation. However, as long as we unite and work together to fight, the final victory will surely belong to us."

The radio said that the people of Vientiane expressed satisfaction and supported the policy line of the National Committee for Peace, Neutrality, National Harmony and Unification.

Then, Prime Minister Phouma gave a report to the meeting on the policy line and the achievements of the government's work. He explained the initial results achieved in implementing the line of peace and neutrality. He pointed out that the Lao Royal Government has established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and accepted Soviet aid. In addition, delegations will also be sent to the People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to establish economic and cultural relations.

Prince Phouma also talked about the results of the negotiations with the Lao Patriotic Front, and he pointed out that the negotiating delegations of both sides, as well as Prince Phouma and Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued a joint communiqué.

The radio said that Prince Phouma also condemned foreign interference in Lao internal affairs and warned against such interference. He called on all the Lao people to unite, fight resolutely, and support the government in realizing the noble cause of the nation.

    方·丰萨万说，琅勃拉邦市和其他城市驻军、警察、公务员、僧侣、王族人士和各阶层人民应当同政府和寮国战斗部队密切合作，以把自己居住的城市从叛国集团的控制下解放出来。
    被叛国集团诱骗和威迫的军队和警察官兵们，应当立即本着爱国精神而脱离叛国集团，投向政府和人民方面。他说：“你们将会受到应有的接待。你们应当立功赎罪，不要为叛国集团送掉性命。”
    他最后说，“我们为引导祖国走上和平中立和民族和睦的道路而进行的斗争是很艰巨的，我们将会碰到许多困难，敌人将会大力破坏我们民族的进步。但是，只要我们团结一致，同心协力进行斗争，最后胜利一定属于我们。”
