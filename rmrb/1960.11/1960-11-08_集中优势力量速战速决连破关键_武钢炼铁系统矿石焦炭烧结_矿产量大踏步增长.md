　　Wuhan, November 7th (reporting from this newspaper) The ironmaking system's various plants and mines at Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation are using the experience of organizing offensive battles to mobilize the masses and concentrate forces to solve key problems in raw material production. This has played a significant role in ensuring the supply of ironmaking raw materials in large quantities and of high quality. Since mid-August, the plants and mines have solved more than a thousand large and small production problems. As a result, the production of various raw materials has generally increased. Compared to September, the output of raw iron ore and iron powder in October increased by 44.9% and 35.8% respectively, coke also increased by 29.5%, and sintered ore increased by 27%.

　　In recent years, through practical production experience, Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation workers have generally recognized that it is necessary to improve the work on ironmaking raw materials so that the blast furnaces can be "fed full and fed well" to enable high-yield and high-quality pig iron, and further guarantee a substantial increase in steel production. In order to ensure the production and supply of ironmaking raw materials, the company's Party Committee Secretary and Manager personally led a group of cadres to the sintering plant, which has the greatest impact on the blast furnace, to help them study and solve problems. The Party Committee Secretaries and Directors of Daye Iron Mine, the Sintering Plant, the Coking Plant, and the Ironmaking Plant also led cadres to go deep into the groups, working and seeking out key production problems in their respective departments together with the workers. After a period of on-the-job labor, they respectively found major key problems such as the need for the sintering plant to thoroughly remove accumulated ash and strengthen equipment maintenance and repair; the iron mine must open up new ore sources; the coking plant must eliminate fire from furnace doors; and the ironmaking plant must strengthen raw material management. Then, they mobilized the masses to tackle these key problems. Each major tackling plan was repeatedly discussed by leaders and the masses, and detailed measures were formulated. During the tackling process, leaders at all levels gathered on the scene, participating in labor while dispatching and directing; staff from various departments also went deep into the scene to provide services.

　　The workers of the Sintering Plant first successfully used the experience of concentrating superior forces to fight annihilation battles in stages and sections. For example, if the area of accumulated ash was large and the quantity was high, it would be cleaned in three times. If a large number of furnace grates needed to be replaced to stop the ash blockage, the task was also very large, so it was carried out in two steps. When overhauling the sintering machine, the entire factory concentrated all its forces except those who insisted on production. Because the forces were concentrated, forming an absolute advantage, it was guaranteed that every battle would be won. In just over seven days, the factory cleared more than 1,000 tons of accumulated ash, replaced 160 tons of furnace grates, and thoroughly overhauled a sintering machine, greatly improving production conditions and increasing output every ten days.

　　During the tackling process, the broad masses of workers launched labor competitions, seeking out tricks, tapping potential, and innovating technologies to overcome many difficulties, enabling the rapid resolution of various problems. The sintering plant needed to dismantle and replace the worn furnace grates on the sintering machine to further eliminate the root cause of excessive ash, but the furnace grates weighed 160 tons, with 40,000 pieces. It would take three or four hundred people two days just to transport them. In the discussion, the workers said, "If all the workers in our factory carry ten or twenty pieces when going to and from work, we can finish the move quickly with a large number of people." In this way, without adding a single person, they completed the task scheduled to be completed in six days within three days. In the past, the overhaul of the sintering machine was done by 400 people sent by the Mechanical General Factory. This time, however, the workers of the Sintering Plant decided to use maintenance workers as the backbone, with production workers learning and doing at the same time, participating in the overhaul. Because they were familiar with the equipment and absorbed the past maintenance experience, making the plan specific and the materials and tools fully prepared, more than 200 people completed the entire overhaul of the No. 2 sintering machine in 20 hours with good quality.

　　At the same time, the workers of the Ironmaking Plant concentrated their efforts to strengthen the work of the raw materials workshop, doing everything possible to supply high-quality materials to the blast furnace. Some of the workers in the raw materials workshop used to think that their department was a "transfer terminal" and could not do anything to produce high-quality and high-yield blast furnaces. In this movement to increase production and practice economy, they realized that the raw materials workshop is the throat of the blast furnace and can do a lot to promote blast furnace production. In order to ensure the entry of high-quality materials into the furnace, with the support of other units, they vigorously improved the workshop environment, carried out equipment maintenance and technological transformation, installed coke grading and the third screening equipment for sintered ore by themselves, and strengthened raw material management. They also established a system of mine trough organization, fixed loading, and group-based testing, which not only removed unqualified raw materials, but also allowed for the combined use of various grades of raw materials, making the furnace charge composition more stable. They also actively strengthened contacts with mines, coking plants, sintering plants, and transportation departments, enabling them to grasp the raw material supply situation in a timely and advance manner.

    集中优势力量速战速决连破关键
    武钢炼铁系统矿石焦炭烧结　矿产量大踏步增长
    本报武汉7日电　武汉钢铁公司炼铁系统各厂矿，运用组织攻关战役的经验，发动群众，集中力量解决原料生产中的关键问题，对保证供应数量多、质量好的炼铁原料起了很大的作用。8月中旬以来，各厂矿先后解决生产中的大小问题一千多项，使各项原料普遍增产，10月份的产量与9月比较，铁矿的原矿和粉矿分别增加44.9％和35.8％，焦炭也提高了29.5％，烧结矿提高27％。
    武汉钢铁公司职工在近年来的生产实践中，普遍认识到必须搞好炼铁原料工作，使高炉能吃饱吃好，才能使生铁高产优质，进而保证钢产量大幅度上升。为了保证炼铁原料的生产和供应，公司党委书记、经理曾亲自率领一批干部，深入对高炉影响最大的烧结厂，帮助他们研究问题，解决问题。大冶铁矿、烧结厂、焦化厂和炼铁厂的党委书记、厂长也分别率领干部深入小组，一边劳动，一边和工人共同找寻本部门的生产关键问题。经过一段时间的跟班劳动，分别找到了烧结厂必须彻底清除积灰，加强设备维护、检修；铁矿必须开辟新矿源；焦化厂必须消灭炉门冒火；炼铁厂必须加强原料管理等重大关键问题。接着，他们又针对这些关键问题，发动群众攻关。每项重大攻关计划，都经过领导和群众几次反复讨论，订出了详细的措施。在攻关时，各级领导干部齐集现场，一面参加劳动，一面调度指挥；科室人员也深入现场服务。
    烧结厂职工首先成功地运用了集中优势力量分步分段打歼灭战的经验。如积灰的面积大、数量多，就分成三次清除，堵灰需要换大量炉篦子，任务也很大，就分为两步进行；在检修烧结机时，全厂则集中了除坚持生产以外的全部力量。由于力量集中，形成了绝对优势，保证了打一仗胜一仗。这个厂前后只用了七天多的时间，就清除了积灰一千多吨，换炉篦子一百六十吨，彻底检修了一台烧结机，使生产条件大大改善，产量旬旬上升。
    在攻关中，广大职工群众都展开劳动竞赛，找窍门、挖潜力，革新技术，克服了不少困难，使各项问题得以迅速解决。烧结厂需要拆换烧结机上磨损了的炉篦，进一步消除灰多的根源，但炉篦子有四万块、一百六十吨重，光是搬运就得三四百人搬两天。工人们在讨论中说，我们全厂职工，每人上下班时带上十块二十块，人多力量大很快就能搬完。这样，他们没增加一个人，就在三天内完成了计划六天完成的任务。过去检修烧结机都是由机械总厂派四百人来干。这次，烧结厂工人却决定以维修工人为骨干，生产工人边学边做，参加检修。由于他们对设备比较熟悉，并吸收了过去检修的经验，作到计划措施具体，材料工具准备充分，结果两百多人在二十小时内将二号烧结机全部检修完毕，质量很好。
    与此同时，炼铁厂职工集中力量加强原料车间的工作，千方百计供应高炉精料。原料车间的部分职工，过去认为本部门是“过载码头”，对高炉优质高产无能为力。他们在这次增产节约运动中，认清了原料车间是高炉的咽喉，对促进高炉生产大有可为。为了保证精料入炉，在其他单位支援下，他们大力改善车间环境，大搞设备检修和技术改造，自己动手装置焦炭分级和烧结矿第三次过筛的设备，加强原料管理。并建立起矿槽编组，固定装料，分组化验使用的制度，不仅剔出了不合规格的原料，而且能将各级原料搭配使用，使炉料成分比较稳定。他们还主动加强了与矿山、焦化厂、烧结厂和运输部门的联系，做到了及时地、预先地掌握原料供应情况。
