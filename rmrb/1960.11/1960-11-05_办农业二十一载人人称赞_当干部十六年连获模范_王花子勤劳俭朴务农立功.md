Runs agriculture for 21 years, praised by all; serves as cadre for 16 years, repeatedly wins model status.
Wang Huazi diligently and frugally builds merit in agriculture.
Wang Huazi, this family member of a revolutionary cadre, listens to the Party and has been devoted to agricultural production for 21 years. She has served as mutual aid team leader and production team leader for 16 years, making great contributions to building a new socialist countryside. The Party and the people have given her the honorary title of "Labor Model," which she has received for 16 consecutive years.
The members of the Qiaotou Management Area of the Qiaotou Commune in Baode County, Shanxi Province, her hometown, often give her a thumbs-up and praise her: "Our Huazi is a good family member and a good commune member. She does not rely on her husband, does not crave enjoyment, is not afraid of hardship, and is not extravagant. She wholeheartedly builds a beautiful and happy rural people's commune. She is a good example for cadre families and a good example for all commune members!"

Husband is a cadre, but she loves to work
Wang Huazi is forty years old this year. From the age of six or seven, she followed her parents in the wind and rain, working in the fields all day long. By the time she was fifteen or sixteen, she had become a "farming expert." Poor uncles and elders praised her for "having the backbone of a poor person and being able to support half a son for the Wang family." Rich people said she was "always barefoot and had no daughter's appearance. She won't even be able to find a husband's family."
Contrary to what the rich people said, Huazi found a good son-in-law. In 1938, she married Gao Zhenquan from Qiaotou Village. Gao Zhenquan was a young man with class consciousness. Not long after the marriage, he joined the Party and participated in revolutionary work. His parents, who were in their sixties, could not do heavy work because of fatigue and illness. As soon as he participated in revolutionary work, the burden of supporting the whole family fell on the new daughter-in-law, Huazi.
Huazi, who was used to working, had only been married for a few months when she asked her father-in-law to lead her and carry manure to the fields. Her actions immediately caused a sensation in the whole village. Yang Cuie, who lived next door, said in astonishment:
"Oh dear! You just got married, your shoes are not even dirty yet, and you are carrying manure for him, aren't you afraid of being laughed at!" Then she taught Huazi a lesson: "As the saying goes, 'marry a man to have clothes to wear and food to eat.' Zhenquan runs around, doesn't care about family affairs, doesn't support you, but you support him! Don't do anything for him, see if he cares!"
Huazi, who grew up in hardship, learned a principle from her poor days: no work, no food. At first, she just smiled and said, "What will we eat if we don't work!" After hearing too much gossip, and not yet understanding the revolution, she said to Zhenquan one day in a fit of pique:
"People say: marry a man to have clothes to wear and food to eat. The man I married, not to mention 'clothes to wear and food to eat,' can't even get a bucket of water."
Zhenquan smiled and said, "Don't rely on me! We are now making a revolution to overthrow the landlords and rich people who oppress the poor, and also to overthrow the old rules that oppress women. Women are equal to men; relying on men for a living means being beaten, abused, and oppressed. Besides, you have your own hands, why rely on a man?..."
"Ah! I understand!" Under the constant education of her lover, Huazi understood the principles of revolution, recognized that labor is glorious and relying on men is shameful, took on the burden of the family's livelihood, and encouraged Zhenquan to concentrate on making revolution. In 1944, she led more than a dozen women to organize a mutual aid team to spin yarn and weave cloth for the border region's supply and marketing cooperative, transport saltpeter for gunpowder, and carry water and cultivate land for the families of soldiers and martyrs, supporting the revolutionary struggle. Therefore, in 1944, she was elected as a labor model. Later, her lover became the secretary of the Baode County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the director of the County Trade Bureau. She still remained rooted in her hometown, devoted to agricultural production, and continued to sell grain and sew clothes and make shoes for her lover. From the liberation of the country until today, her lover has successively served as the manager of the Xi'an Electrical Appliance Company and the head of the Personnel Section of the Xi'an Normal College. She still has not left the countryside and still serves as the leader of the mutual aid team and the production team leader in the village, building a socialist rural people's commune. Her family's living expenses, except for the children's schooling which is provided by her lover, the food for her and the old people all depends on her labor dividends and has never cost her lover any money.

Doesn't live in the city, lives in the countryside
In 1956, just after the Spring Festival, Huazi received a letter from Zhenquan. Zhenquan asked her to take advantage of the slack season to go to Xi'an to broaden her horizons and increase her knowledge. Huazi agreed with this idea and decided to go to Xi'an to see.
Aunt Zhang, who lived next door to the west, repeatedly told Huazi:
"Since you got married, you have always stayed at home. Now it's peaceful, and Zhenquan is an old cadre, you should go and enjoy yourself!"
"No, Aunt Zhang! I still have to come back, I can't leave labor!"
"Humph! Don't be stubborn, when you get to Xi'an, live in a big building, wear good clothes, eat good food, you'll forget the poor mountain village, you'll be afraid that eight sedan chairs won't be able to carry you back!"
"If I tell you, you won't believe me, time will tell, let's wait and see!"
"Right! Let's wait and see, I guarantee you will go further and further away."
Huazi, who had never left the mountainous area, felt that the big city was indeed lively when she arrived in Xi'an! But Huazi, who was used to labor, had nothing to do after living there for a few days, just wandering around and eating, and felt that it was not as comfortable as working with everyone in the commune.
At this time, Gao Zhenquan was serving as the manager of the Xi'an Electrical Appliance Company. He deliberately took Huazi to see many factories, and then asked Huazi:
"Is the big city good or not?"
"Extremely good!"
"Our countryside will also be like the city in the future, with machines, factories, electric lights, and buildings..."
"I don't know when that will happen?"
"Soon, take the many factories we have seen, aren't they all making machines for the countryside? Our rural people must concentrate on agricultural production, work hard, produce more grain, and support the city. Now some people don't understand these principles and just want to run to the city..."
Huazi felt more and more enlightened as she listened, and interjected with a smile:
"Don't worry, even if you don't say these things, I won't live in the city. However, what you said made me understand a principle even more."
"What principle?"
"Just what you said, work hard, produce more grain, support the city, support industry, so that our countryside can use machines as soon as possible, quickly build socialism, and let future generations live a more comfortable life."
Huazi understood these principles and didn't want to stay any longer. She was thinking about the commune's business, she was eager to explain these principles to her fellow villagers, and she wanted to return to the village immediately.
As soon as Huazi arrived in the village, she was surrounded by people. People praised her for being "good, not greedy for enjoyment, and not forgetting the countryside." Only Kang Yumei and Xu Zainv said, "Hey! You don't enjoy your blessings, you only seek suffering."
Huazi said with a smile: "Don't run to the city indiscriminately, make up your mind and work in the village. Our countryside will also have machines, factories, electric lights, and cars in the future..."
Kang Yumei and Xu Zainv said: "Stop it, you've only been gone for a few days and you've learned to brag!"
Huazi said: "It's true, it's not bragging, Zhenquan said it." She told everyone about the bright prospects for the countryside and the importance of doing a good job in agriculture and supporting industry. Finally, she repeatedly told everyone that they must concentrate on working hard and not think that the other mountain is higher than this one.

Not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulties
In the past, Huazi was also a pioneer in labor, but since returning from Xi'an, she has been rushing to the forefront in whatever work she does. She often says: "You can't get sweetness without suffering. How can we quickly build socialism without working harder!"
In the winter of 1957, their commune was building water conservancy projects on the hillside. At that time, the hoe hit the hard frozen ground, like hitting a steel plate. Some female commune members, seeing this situation, grimaced and were unwilling to participate. Huazi took the lead in participating and encouraged everyone to work hard.
After the communization in 1958, a high tide of leaps forward was set off everywhere, and Huazi worked even more diligently and selflessly. When smelting steel, she competed with male commune members to carry ore. Because she was careless, she twisted her leg. The commune cadres asked her to go back to rest, but she quietly ran to the crucible team to participate in labor.
In the winter of 1959, she led female commune members to participate in road construction. During the five-day Spring Festival holiday, she only returned to the village for one day and then ran back to the construction site to work.
While everyone was working hard and practically, Xu Zai Nv and Li Jincui, family members of cadres, had money to spend, disliked the hard work, and refused to participate in labor.
Huazi found them several times and patiently helped them:
"As cadre families, we should have higher awareness with the help of our partners, and we should take the lead in labor, without any special treatment. I often say, even if you have money to spend, you can't not work, everyone relies on money for food, where does the grain come from!"
"We know! We'll go to work later." They said that, but they still didn't go to work.
Seeing that talking was not working, Huazi called them to go whenever she went to the fields. When they arrived in the fields, she used her own practical actions to influence and educate them.
In July of this year, after a drought, there was a rain. Huazi quickly organized women to go to the fields to apply fertilizer and rescue the seedlings. Xu Zai Nv and Li Jincui arrived in the fields, saw the thin, muddy manure, wrinkled their noses, and turned their mouths away, disgusted with the dirt and unwilling to work. Without saying a word, Huazi rolled up her sleeves, asked everyone to dig pits, and she came to pour the manure.
Huazi's labor, which was not afraid of hardship, fatigue, or dirt, educated Xu Zai Nv, Li Jincui, and other cadre family members, and also educated the commune members present.
Under the guidance of the three red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, Huazi's hometown has greatly changed its appearance. This small mountain village in the midst of mountains has been connected to automobiles, lit up with electric lights, has an iron factory, a coal-to-oil factory, a power station, and many water fields...
One night, Huazi pointed to the star-like electric lights and the rows of factory buildings at the foot of the mountain and said to the commune members: "Five years ago, when I came back from Xi'an, I told everyone that our countryside would also have machines, factories, electric lights, and cars, and some people didn't believe it..."
Xu Zai Nv interjected with a blushing face: "Huazi has great vision and sees far, in the future, we must learn from Huazi."
High Yin Chun, Wang Dengying, Zhang Xiumei and others, middle school students who returned to their hometown to participate in production during the holidays, continued, "We must also learn from Huazi, and we will definitely return to participate in agricultural production after graduating from middle school to build a beautiful and happy rural people's commune!"
Huazi said: "I have nothing to learn, everyone should listen to the Party's words, I also grew up listening to the Party's words!"

    办农业二十一载人人称赞　当干部十六年连获模范
    王花子勤劳俭朴务农立功
    王花子，这个革命干部的家属，听党的话，二十一年如一日地安心农业生产。她担任互助组长、生产队长十六年，为建设社会主义新农村做出很大贡献。党和人民给她以“劳动模范”光荣称号，也已经连续十六年。
    她的家乡——山西保德县桥头公社桥头管理区的社员们，常翘起大拇指夸奖她：“俺们的花子，是个好家属，好社员。她不依赖男人，不贪图享受，不怕艰难困苦，不铺张浪费，全心全意建设美好幸福的农村人民公社。她是干部家属的好榜样。也是全体社员的好榜样！”
  丈夫当干部，自己爱劳动
    王花子，今年四十岁。六、七岁便跟上爹妈风里来，雨里去，成天滚战在地里。她到十五、六岁，就成了“庄稼通”。穷叔叔大爷夸她“有穷人骨气，能给王家顶个半大小子。”有钱人说她“成天赤头赤足，没有闺女样。连个婆家也找不上。”
    和有钱人说的两样，花子正挑了个好女婿。1938年，她和桥头村高振全结婚了。高振全，是个有阶级觉悟的青年，结婚不多日，便入了党，参加了革命工作。他六十多岁的父母亲，因为劳累成疾，不能干重活，他一参加革命工作，全家人的生活担子，便落到新媳妇花子的身上。
    劳动惯的花子，过门个数月，便让公爹引着自己，背着粪往地里送。她这样一做，马上轰动了全村。隔壁杨翠娥，大惊小怪地说：
    “哎呀呀！你刚过门，鞋底还没脏，到给他背粪，不怕让人笑死！”接着，她又教训开花子：“俗话说‘嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭。’振全东跑西跳，不管家事，不养活你，你才养活他呀！不要给他干，看他管不管！”
    苦水里泡大的花子，刚懂事，穷日子就教给她一条道理：不劳动，没饭吃。她起初听了这些话，只是笑的说：“咱不劳动吃啥！”听闲话多了，加上对革命还没认识，一天便对振全赌气的说：
    “人家们说：嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭，我嫁的汉别说‘穿衣吃饭’，连桶水也靠不上。”
    振全笑着说：“你不要靠我啦！咱们现在闹革命，要打倒压迫穷人的地主老财，也要打倒男人压迫女人的旧规矩。女人和男人，一样平等；靠男人养活，要挨打受气、受压迫的。再说，自己有双手，为啥要靠男人？……”
      “啊！我明白啦！”花子在爱人的不断教育下，懂得了革命的道理，认清劳动光荣，靠男人可耻，扛起全家生活的担子，鼓励振全安心闹革命。1944年，她又带领十几个妇女，组织起互助组，给边区供销社纺线织布，捎做火药的芒硝，给抗属、烈属担水、种地，支援革命斗争。因此，她在1944年，便被选为劳动模范。以后，她爱人当了中共保德县委会的秘书，县贸易局长，她仍然扎根家乡安心务农，照旧卖上粮食，给自己的爱人缝衣服、做鞋袜。从全国解放直到今天，她爱人先后当了西安交电公司经理、西安师范学院人事科长，她还是没有离开农村，依然在村里当互助组长、生产队长，建设社会主义农村人民公社。她家的生活费用，除孩子们念书由爱人供给外，她和老人们的口粮，全靠她劳动分红，没花过爱人的钱。
      不住城市住农村
    1956年，刚过春节，花子接到振全一封信。振全让她趁农闲，到西安一趟，开开眼界，增加些知识。花子同意这个意见，决定到西安去看看。
    西隔壁张婶，再三叮咛花子：
    “你自过门以后，总是呆在家里。这下太平啦，振全又是老干部，你快去享享福吧！”
    “不，张婶！我还要回来，我丢不下劳动！”
    “哼！你不要嘴硬，到了西安，住上大楼，穿上好的，吃上好的，早把穷山沟忘啦，总怕八台轿也抬不回你来！”
      “我说你们不信，日久见人心，咱们走的看吧！”
      “对！咱们走的看，我打保票，你定是越走越远。”
    从没离开过山区的花子，到了西安，觉得大城市到底热闹！可是劳动惯了的花子，住了几天，只是游逛、吃饭，两手闲的没事干，就感到不如在社里和大家一块劳动舒展。
    这时，高振全正担任西安交电公司经理。他有意引花子看了好多工厂，然后问花子：
      “大城市好不好？”
    “好极啦！”
    “咱们农村，将来也要和城市一样，要有机器，有工厂，有电灯，有楼房……”
    “这不知道多会才能办到？”
    “也快，拿咱们看过的好多工厂说吧，还不都是给农村造机器。咱们农村的人，一定要安心农业生产，好好劳动，多打粮食，支援城市。现在有些人，不懂这些道理，光想往城市里跑……”
    花子越听越心胸开朗，笑着插嘴说：
    “你放心吧，你不说这些，我也不在城市住。不过，你说这些，更让我弄清一个道理。”
      “啥道理？”
    “就你刚才说的呗，好好劳动，多打粮食，支援城市，支援工业，叫咱农村早日使上机器，快快建设社会主义，让后辈儿孙过更舒服的日子。”
    花子翻清这些道理，再不想多住了。她惦念着社里的营生，她急着要向乡亲们讲明这些道理，她想马上回村去。
    花子一到村，便被人们包围起来。人们夸奖她是“好样的，没有贪图享受，没有忘了农村。”只有康玉梅、徐在女说：“嗨！你有福不享，专寻的受罪。”
    花子笑的说：“不要往城市乱跑啦，拿定主意，在村干吧。咱们农村将来也要有机器，有工厂，有电灯，通汽车……”
    康玉梅，徐在女说：“快算啦，你走了几天，学会个胡吹！”
    花子说：“真的，不是胡吹，这是振全说的。”她给大家讲了农村的幸福前景，讲了搞好农业、支援工业的重要性。最后，再三叮咛大家，一定要安心好好干，不要这山看见那山高。
      不怕艰苦不怕困难
    花子过去劳动也是打先锋，自打从西安回来，更是不管干啥活，都是抢在最前头。她常说：“不受苦中苦，难得甜上甜。不多出几身汗，怎能快快建设社会主义！”
    1957年冬天，她们社在山坡上修水利。当时，钁头刨到硬硬的冻地上，像刨到钢板上一样。有些女社员，看到这种情形，便咧了嘴，不愿参加。花子带头参加，并鼓励大家好好干。
    1958年公社化后，到处掀起跃进高潮，花子更是勤勤恳恳的忘我劳动。大炼钢铁的时候，她和男社员竞赛背矿石，因为不小心，把腿歪了一下。社干部叫她回去休息，她却又悄悄跑到捏坩埚队参加劳动。
    1959年冬天，她领导女社员，参加修公路，过春节放假五天，她只回村一天，便又跑回工地劳动。
    就在大家这样苦干实干的时候，干部家属徐在女、李金翠，因为手里有钱花，嫌干活苦，推推架架不参加劳动。
    花子几次找见她们，耐心帮助：
    “咱们干部家属，按说有爱人帮助，觉悟高，更应带头劳动，不该有半点特殊。我常说，有钱花，也不能不劳动，大家都靠钱吃饭，粮食从哪里来！”
    “知道啦！俺们以后劳动去。”她们说是说啦，还是不去劳动。
    花子见说不行，每次下地，又三番五次叫她们去。到了地里，她又用自己的实际行动，来影响她们，教育她们。
    今年7月，在天旱中下了一场雨，花子就赶紧组织妇女下地追肥，抢救禾苗。徐在女、李金翠到了地里，看见稀糊糊的茅粪，又?鼻子，又歪嘴，嫌肮脏，不愿干。花子二话没说，把袖子一挽，叫大家挖坑，她来倒粪。
    花子这样不怕苦、不怕累、不怕脏的劳动，教育了徐在女、李金翠等干部家属，也教育了在场的社员。
    花子的家乡，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的照耀下，现已大大改变面貌。这个万山丛中的小山庄，已经通了汽车，点上电灯，有了铁厂，有了煤炼油厂，有了发电站，有了不少水地……
    一天晚上，花子指着山下繁星似的电灯，一幢幢的厂房，对社员们说：“五年前，我从西安回来，和大家说，咱们农村也要有机器，有工厂，有电灯，通汽车，有些人不相信……”
    徐在女脸红红的插嘴说：“花子眼光大，看得远，往后，咱们一定要向花子学习。”
    放假回乡参加生产的中学生高银春、王登英、张秀梅等，接住说：“我们也要向花子学习，中学毕业，一定回来参加农业生产，建设美好幸福的农村人民公社！”
    花子说：“我没啥学的，大家还是好好听党的话吧，我也是听党的话长大的！”
