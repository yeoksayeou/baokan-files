    Sanxing Brigade Implements Policies Comprehensively, Systematically, and Thoroughly
    All Aspects of Production Fully Developed; 95% of Commune Members Increase Income

    (Reported by this newspaper) Letting the masses grasp policies and using policies to promote production is the main experience of the Party branch of the Sanxing Brigade in Nanheng Commune, Longnan County, Jiangxi Province, in leading production. Under the unified leadership of the commune, this brigade, due to its in-depth and meticulous work, can comprehensively and systematically implement the policies thoroughly, thereby maximizing the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Since this year, all aspects of work have been at the forefront, and a new situation of comprehensive leap forward has emerged in all aspects of production in the entire brigade.

          Comprehensive Leap Forward in All Aspects of Production
    The Sanxing Brigade is a small basin surrounded by mountains, with ninety-two households and four hundred and twenty-one people in the entire brigade. It is divided into five production teams according to six natural villages. The cultivated land area is five hundred and thirty mu, with one hundred and fifty-one laborers. Before communization, although grain production in this brigade increased every year, the increase was small, and the shortage of grain had not changed. Every year, 20,000 to 30,000 jin of grain had to be transferred in. After communization, production developed rapidly, and grain production increased year after year. This year, it is not only completely sufficient to eat, but also has surplus grain. The annual grain purchase task was fully completed and put into storage during the summer harvest season alone. Under the方針 of "taking grain as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward," other productions have also achieved comprehensive leap forward. This year, the income of commune members is more than the income of one and a half years before communization, so that 95% of the commune members have increased their income. The dining hall has good family production, and vegetables, oil, and other things have achieved self-sufficiency with surplus. Under the unified leadership of the brigade, the household sideline production of commune members has also developed greatly. Every household raises pigs and chickens, and grows vegetables. Due to the development of production, the increase of income, and the improvement of life, people's enthusiasm for production is even higher.
        Everything is handled in accordance with the Party's policies
    The reason why this brigade has achieved such great achievements is mainly due to the fact that the brigade Party branch handles everything in strict accordance with the Party's policies, and comprehensively, systematically, and correctly implements the Party's policies to the end. Ye Yuanbing, who came from a poor peasant family, took office as the secretary of the Party branch of this brigade in July last year. From his own personal experience, he deeply understands that as long as he does what the Party says, there is nothing that cannot be done. He always first conducts repeated discussions on the Party's various policies and the various tasks distributed by the commune at the brigade level through the Party branch, the team committee, Party members, Youth League members, activists, and the commune members' congress, and formulates specific plans in light of the specific conditions of the brigade, and then implements them to the masses without compromise. The Party's policy stipulates that labor should be concentrated to strengthen the front line of agricultural production. The entire brigade immediately carried out cleaning, and after rational arrangement, ensured that more than 80% of the labor force was put into field operations, and at the same time established a strict management system. In implementing the principle of "each according to his ability, to each according to his work," according to the principle of less deduction and more distribution and the combination of the wage system and the supply system, the system of pre-paying wages on a monthly basis was adhered to. In terms of the "three guarantees and one reward," various crops generally adhered to the responsibility system of three guarantees to the team and five quotas to the group, which greatly strengthened the sense of responsibility of the commune members. In order to implement the policy of combining work and rest, this brigade adhered to the monthly holiday system, insisted on not working night shifts, and even during the most tense period of production, it must ensure that commune members have eight hours of sleep; at the same time, it also often organizes various recreational activities centered on the current political movement, so that the masses have both work and rest.
    Careful study is the prerequisite for comprehensive implementation of policies
    In the practice of various tasks, the Party branch of the Sanxing Brigade deeply realized that: constantly studying and researching the Party's policies and guidelines, enhancing policy awareness, and improving policy level are important prerequisites for implementing the Party's policies and guidelines. In their own words: half-cooked rice is not tasty, half-baked things cannot be done, and if you cannot understand the spiritual essence of the policy, there will be deviations in implementation.
    In the past, most of the land in this brigade was only planted for one season, and more than one-third of the dry land had to be reserved every year. Although some paddy fields had been expanded in the past few years, the total output had not increased rapidly. In order to change farming habits, before the spring plowing and production this year, the brigade Party branch organized cadres to further study the Party's方針 of taking grain as the key link, comprehensively leaping forward, and combining multiple planting with high yield and multiple harvests. On the basis of improving the understanding of cadres, the Party branch immediately organized forces to go deep into the teams, work groups, and commune members' homes to carry out propaganda and education work to the broad masses. During this period, Ye Yuanbing, secretary of the Party branch, almost publicized the Party's方針 wherever he went. In this way, the方針 of combining multiple planting with high yield and multiple harvests was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. As a result, not only the area of dry land was further reduced, but also the cultivated land area was expanded by more than one hundred and ten mu, and more than 27,000 jin of rice and miscellaneous grains were harvested this year.
    Policies meet with the masses to ensure that every item is realized
    To implement policies, we must follow the mass line. This is exactly what this brigade did. Before any policy is implemented, it is always first publicized to the masses, and in light of the specific situation of the team, the masses are mobilized to study the measures for implementation, so as to become everyone's practical action. For example, in the implementation of the "three guarantees and one reward" system, when formulating the "three guarantees," the brigade first puts forward a plan, and then submits it to the commune members for discussion and revision, and finally determines the implementation method; when fulfilling the rewards, it is also from bottom to top, checking the implementation situation item by item, rewarding those who should be rewarded, and punishing those who should be punished. In this year's summer harvest, the Second Team did not complete the early rice production plan. After discussion by the masses, it was confirmed that the yield reduction was not due to natural disasters or other special reasons, but due to insufficient drive. Therefore, according to the production guarantee plan, after considering the impact of the disaster, the part of the yield reduction was compensated by 50%. The four teams that exceeded the production guarantee targets were also rewarded in accordance with the plan. In late rice production, this penalized team worked hard, corrected its shortcomings, caught up quickly, and overfulfilled the production guarantee target. This fact made all the cadres further deeply understand the power of the policy. In every work they carry out, they implement and fulfill the policy at the same time, which better mobilizes the enthusiasm of the masses. The masses see that the brigade cadres handle affairs everywhere in accordance with the Party's policies and think of everyone everywhere, and they are more consciously concerned about and do a good job in collective production.
        Continuously improve the policy level of cadres
    In order to educate cadres to recognize the seriousness of policies and the importance of implementing policies, the Party branch also often educates cadres with examples. The entire brigade took the First Team, which implemented the policies more deeply, as an example and organized cadres to visit and study. Chen Linhui, the leader of the First Team, is a lower-middle peasant. In his various tasks, he actively publicizes policies and relies on poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants to formulate plans for implementing policies, submit them to the commune members for discussion, and then, after leadership approval, immediately mobilize the masses to implement them. Therefore, every policy is implemented quickly and well. During the summer harvest this year, there were ten mu of fields in Zhangshukeng. Because the seedlings were not growing well and the road was far away, no one wanted to go when assigning work. The team leader went deep into the commune members to understand this situation and convened a meeting of poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasant activists that night to adjust the labor quota and pass it through discussion by the commune members. The plan was immediately implemented, ensuring that the summer harvest task was completed on time and with quality. During the winter planting, the team cadres publicized various policies related to winter planting to the commune members from house to house. The commune members' enthusiasm for winter planting was unprecedentedly high. They went out early and returned late, striving to overfulfill the winter planting plan. Team leader Ye Xiangyu said when talking about his experience, "Resolutely and meticulously implementing the Party's policies and guidelines seems complicated, but in reality, as long as the policies are grasped by the masses, all work will be twice the result with half the effort and easy to handle."
        The masses supervise the implementation of policies
    With the in-depth implementation of various policies, the commune members not only actively handle affairs in accordance with the Party's policies, but also consciously rise up to supervise the implementation of the policies. In August, when implementing the policy of concentrating the labor force and strengthening the management of autumn fields, the commune members rose up to check why only 70% of the Second Team participated in field production. At a commune members' congress, female commune member Lai Chunxiu sharply pointed out: "The Party's requirement is to strengthen the front line of agriculture. Why do the wives of some cadres in the Second Team not go to the front line to work? They keep calling for the concentration of labor, but the cadres don't take the lead. How can we concentrate?" Ye Huiqing, the leader of the Second Team, made a self-criticism on the spot at the meeting, and his wife also took the initiative to request that she be transferred back to field production. Under the influence of this incident, other labor forces that should have gone to the front line also quickly went to the front line, and the masses' production enthusiasm was very high.

    三星大队执行政策全面系统一通到底
    各项生产全面发展95％社员增加收入
    本报讯　让群众掌握政策，用政策推动生产，这是江西省龙南县南亨公社三星大队党支部领导生产的主要经验。这个大队在公社统一领导下，由于工作做得深入细致，能够全面地、系统地把政策贯彻到底，从而最大限度地调动了干部和群众的积极性，今年以来，样样工作走在前头，全队各项生产出现了全面跃进的崭新局面。
          各项生产全面跃进
    三星大队是一个山岭环抱的小盆地，全大队有九十二户，四百二十一口人，按六个自然村，划成五个生产小队。耕地面积有五百三十亩，有一百五十一个劳动力。这个大队在公社化以前，粮食产量虽然每年都有增长，但幅度很小，缺粮状况一直没有改变，每年都要调进二、三万斤粮食。公社化以后，生产很快发展起来，粮食连年增产，今年不仅完全够吃，而且有了余粮。全年粮食征购任务，夏收一季即全部完成入库。在“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的方针下，其他生产也获得全面跃进。今年社员一年的收入，就比公社化前一年半的收入还多，使全大队95％的社员都增加了收入。食堂家底生产好，蔬菜、油料等达到了自给有余。在大队统一领导下，社员家庭副业也有很大的发展，家家户户都养猪养鸡、种植蔬菜。由于生产的发展，收入的增加，生活的改善，人们的生产积极性更和高涨。
        一切按照党的政策办事
    这个大队所以能获得如此巨大的成绩，主要是由于大队党支部在一切工作中，不折不扣地按照党的政策办事，全面地、系统地、正确地把党的政策贯彻到底的结果。贫农出身的叶源炳，是去年7月间担任这个大队的党支部书记的。他从自己的切身体验中，深深懂得只要按党的话去做，就没有办不好的事情。他对党的各项政策和公社分配下来的各项任务，总是先在大队经过党支部和队委会、党团员、积极分子和社员大会的反复讨论，结合大队的具体情况，制定具体方案，然后不折不扣地贯彻到群众中去。党的政策规定要集中劳力，加强农业生产第一线。全大队立即进行清理，经过合理安排，保证了80％以上的劳动力投入田间作业，同时建立了严格的管理制度。在贯彻各尽所能、按劳分配方面，根据少扣多分和工资制和供给制相结合的分配原则，坚持了按月预发工资的制度。在“三包一奖”方面，各项作物普遍坚持了三包到队，五定到组的责任制度，大大加强了社员的责任心。为了贯彻劳逸结合的政策，这个大队坚持了每月放假制度，坚持不打夜班，生产最紧张的时期，也一定保证社员有八小时的睡眠时间；同时，还经常组织以当前政治运动为中心的各种文娱活动，让群众有劳有逸。
    认真学习是全面执行政策的前提
    三星大队党支部在各项工作实践中，深刻体会到：经常学习研究党的方针政策，增强政策观念，提高政策水平，是贯彻执行党的方针政策的重要前提。用他们自己的话说：夹生饭不好吃，夹生事情不能做，摸不透政策的精神实质，执行起来就会出偏差。
    这个大队过去大部分土地只种一季，每年要留三分之一以上的旱地，几年来虽然扩大了一些水稻耕地面积，但总产量提高得还是不快。为了改变耕作习惯，今年春耕生产以前，大队党支部组织干部进一步学习了党的关于以粮为纲、全面跃进及多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针，在干部提高认识的基础上，党支部随即组织力量深入到小队、作业组和社员家里，向广大群众开展了宣传教育工作。党支部书记叶源炳在此期间，几乎走到哪里，就把党的这个方针宣传到哪里。这样，就使多种多收和高产多收相结合的方针深入人心。结果，不但进一步缩小了旱地面积，还扩大耕地面积一百一十多亩，今年多收了稻谷和杂粮二万七千多斤。
    政策和群众见面保证项项实现
    贯彻执行政策，必须走群众路线。这个大队正是这样做的。任何政策在执行前总是先向群众宣传，并结合本队具体情况，发动群众研究贯彻执行的措施，从而成为大家的实际行动。如在执行“三包一奖”制度中，在制定“三包”时，先由大队提出一个方案，然后逐项交社员讨论、修订，最后确定执行办法；在兑现的时候，也是由下而上，逐项检查执行情况，该奖的奖，该罚的罚。第二小队在今年夏收中，没有完成早稻包产计划，经过群众讨论，证实亏产并不是由于自然灾害和其他特殊原因，而是干劲不足。因此，按照包产方案，在考虑了灾情影响以后，亏产部分按50％赔产。对四个超包产的小队，也都按照方案规定进行了奖励。在晚稻生产中，这个受罚的小队发愤图强，改正了缺点，急起直追，超额完成了包产指标。这一事实，使全体干部进一步深切体会到政策的威力。他们在进行每一项工作中，都做到边贯彻政策边兑现，更好地调动了群众积极性。群众看到大队干部处处按照党的政策办事，处处为大家着想，更自觉的关心和搞好集体生产。
        不断提高干部政策水平
    为了教育干部认识政策的严肃性，和贯彻执行政策的重要性，党支部还经常以实例教育干部。全大队以执行政策比较深透的第一小队为榜样，组织干部参观学习。第一小队队长陈林辉，是个下中农，他在各项工作中，积极宣传政策，并且依靠贫农和新老下中农做出执行政策的方案，交给社员讨论，然后经过领导批准，立即发动群众执行，所以条条政策贯彻执行得又快又好。今年夏收时，在樟树坑有十亩田，因为禾苗长得不太好，路又远，派工的时候谁都不愿去。小队长深入社员中了解这一情况，当晚就召开了贫农和新老下中农积极分子会，调整了劳动定额，并通过社员讨论，订出方案，立即实行，保证了夏收任务按时按质完成。冬种的时候，小队干部逐家逐户向社员宣传有关冬种的各项政策，社员对冬种的积极性空前高涨，早出晚归，争取超额完成冬种计划。队长叶祥愈谈到他的体会时说，坚决、细致地贯彻执行党的方针政策，看来是复杂的，实际是只要政策为群众所掌握，一切工作就都事半功倍、顺当好办了。
        群众监督政策的执行
    随着各项政策的深入贯彻执行，社员们不仅自己积极按照党的政策办事，而且自觉的起来监督政策的执行。8月间，在贯彻执行集中劳动力，加强秋田管理时，社员们便起来检查为什么第二小队参加田间生产的人只有70％。在一次社员大会上，女社员赖春秀尖锐地提出来：“党的要求是加强农业第一线，第二小队有的干部的爱人为什么不到第一线去劳动呢？整天叫劳力集中，干部不带头，怎样集中？”第二小队队长叶辉清，当场在会上作了检查，他的爱人也主动请求把她调回田间生产。在这件事的影响下，其他应该到第一线的劳动力，也都很快的到了第一线，群众生产情绪非常高涨。　（江西日报记者）
