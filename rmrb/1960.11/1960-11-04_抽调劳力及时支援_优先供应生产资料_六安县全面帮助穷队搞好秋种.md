　　Hefei, November 3rd (from this newspaper) - Lu'an County, Anhui Province, comprehensively helps poor teams and backward teams to plant more and better summer harvest crops in terms of manpower, materials, financial resources, and technology.

　　There are 267 production brigades in the people's communes of Lu'an County, including 19 poor teams and 41 backward teams. The average yield of wheat per mu in these poor teams and backward teams this year is nearly half lower than the average production level of the county. The area of summer harvest crops is also very small, accounting for only 34% of the cultivated land area, which has become a weak link in the county's agricultural production. The Lu'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China believes that giving full play to the production increase potential of poor teams and backward teams is of great significance to striving for a comprehensive increase in summer harvest crops throughout the county next year.

　　This year, Lu'an County, including cadres transferred from the province and the special zone, has concentrated a total of more than 680 cadres throughout the county to form a complete team to strengthen leadership in poor teams and backward teams. Among these cadres, the vast majority are party members and members of the Communist Youth League, and 112 are responsible cadres at the special zone, county, and commune levels. During the autumn planting period, based on the characteristics of poor teams and backward teams that have more land, less labor, and require vigorous processing of thin land, they first strengthened political and ideological work, carried out ideological education on running agriculture in a big way and running food production in a big way, and mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members for production. On the basis of carrying out ideological education, they also focused on running canteens well and comprehensively grasped the welfare of life during the autumn planting period. Now every canteen has a vegetable base, and each person has planted an average of more than two fen of vegetable land. In addition, each poor team and backward team has also prepaid a salary so that commune members can purchase some necessary daily necessities. According to the characteristics of autumn plowing and autumn planting farm work this year, labor quotas have also been comprehensively adjusted for poor teams and backward teams, and the work assessment and point calculation system has been conscientiously implemented. Through the above series of measures, the production enthusiasm of commune members has been greatly improved, and the attendance rate has reached about 95%.

　　Lu'an County also organized all walks of life to support the autumn planting work of poor teams and backward teams in all aspects. Recently, among the labor force transferred from schools, factories, institutions, and urban residents throughout the county, more than 30,000 people went to poor teams and backward teams to support autumn planting. The financial and trade departments, in accordance with the principle of "overall planning and taking all factors into consideration, ensuring key points," give priority to supporting the needs of poor teams and backward teams in autumn planting production in terms of material supply and loans. Commercial departments sent a large number of cadres to various places to try their best to organize sources of goods. Only the supply of rubber-wheeled carts to poor teams and backward teams was more than 1,500, and more than 12,000 pieces of small farm tools and more than 37,000 jin of chemical fertilizers were also supplied. The bank also lent these teams more than 120,000 yuan in loans. In addition to rushing to produce a large number of autumn planting farm tools for poor teams and backward teams, the industrial department also sent nearly 100 workers, bringing ovens, tools, and raw materials, to rush to produce and repair autumn planting farm tools for poor teams and backward teams on a mobile basis.

　　The autumn sowing work of poor teams and backward teams has shown a good situation with the help of all parties. In the past, due to the lack of labor and fertilizer, many paddy fields only grew one season of intermediate rice. Now most of the paddy fields planted with intermediate rice have been utilized. The area of summer harvest crops sown in autumn by each poor team and backward team will be larger than last year. Since the sowing period of summer harvest crops has been advanced by more than half a solar term compared with last year, the sowing plan for more than 25,000 mu of rapeseed has been overfulfilled, and the sowing plan for more than 128,000 mu of wheat has been completed by more than 60%. The past phenomenon of extensive cultivation has undergone fundamental changes, and the quality of autumn sowing has been significantly improved. Wide-row strip sowing has been universally implemented for wheat, achieving rational close planting.

### 抽调劳力及时支援　优先供应生产资料  六安县全面帮助穷队搞好秋种

    抽调劳力及时支援　优先供应生产资料
    六安县全面帮助穷队搞好秋种
    本报合肥3日电　安徽省六安县从人力、物力、财力和技术上，全面帮助穷队和后进队多种、种好夏收作物。
    六安县各人民公社共有二百六十七个生产大队，其中穷队有十九个，后进队有四十一个。这些穷队和后进队，今年每亩小麦的平均产量，比全县的平均生产水平低将近一半；夏收作物面积也很少，只占耕地面积的34％，这就成为全县农业生产中的一个薄弱环节。中共六安县委认为，充分发挥穷队和后进队的增产潜力，对争取明年全县夏收作物的全面增产有很大意义。
    今年，六安县包括省、专区下放的干部在内，全县共集中了六百八十多名干部，组成了整套班子，到穷队和后进队加强领导。在这些干部中，绝大部分是党团员，并且有一百一十二名是专区、县和公社一级的负责干部。在秋种期间，他们根据穷队和后进队土地多、劳力少、土地瘦薄需要大力加工的特点，首先加强政治思想工作，进行大办农业、大办粮食的思想教育，调动了广大社员的生产积极性。在进行思想教育的基础上，又以办好食堂为中心，全面地抓好秋种期间的生活福利。现在每个食堂都有了蔬菜基地，平均每人种了二分多菜地。此外，每个穷队和后进队还都预支了一次工资，以便社员购买一些必需的生活用品。根据今年秋耕、秋种农活的特点，还帮助穷队和后进队全面调整了劳动定额，认真执行了评工计分制度。通过上述一系列措施，社员的生产积极性大大提高，出勤率达到95％左右。
    六安县还组织各行各业，从各方面支援穷队和后进队的秋种工作。最近全县从学校、工厂、机关和城镇居民中抽调的劳动力中，有三万多人是到穷队和后进队支援秋种的。财贸部门根据“统筹兼顾、保证重点”的原则，在物资供应和贷款上，优先支持穷队和后进队的秋种生产中的需要。商业部门派了大批干部到各地千方百计地组织货源，仅供应穷队和后进队的胶轮车就有一千五百多辆，另外还供应了一万二千多件小农具，三万七千多斤化肥。银行还贷给这些队十二万多元贷款。工业部门除了为穷队后进队赶制大批秋种农具以外，还派出了近百个工人，带了烘炉、工具和原材料，为穷队和后进队流动赶制和修配秋种农具。
    穷队和后进队的秋播工作，在各方面的帮助下，出现了良好的局面。往年因为缺乏劳动力和肥料，不少水田只种一季中稻，现在种中稻的水田，已经大部分利用起来。各穷队和后进队秋播的夏收作物面积将比去年扩大。由于夏收作物的播种期比去年提早了半个多节令，二万五千多亩油菜的播种计划已超额完成，十二万八千多亩小麦的播种计划已完成60％以上。过去的耕作粗放现象有了根本改变，秋播质量显著提高。小麦普遍实行了宽幅条播，作到了合理密植。
