    Xinhua News Agency, Yaoundé, 8th - The Cameroonian National Liberation Army continues to actively carry out guerrilla activities. According to recent reports, a strong Cameroonian National Liberation Army unit attacked the village of Bonik-Nomplouan in Loum, Mongo Province, on October 31. In this military operation, four French colonialists' henchmen were killed, one was wounded, and six others were captured.
    The report says that facing the threat of the people's resistance movement, the Cameroonian authorities decided to extend the "state of emergency," which was implemented as early as four months ago in eleven provinces in southern, western, and central Cameroon, to further suppress the activities of patriots.
