Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 14th. The Voice of the Fighting Units of Laos today broadcast a statement by the spokesman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, strongly condemning U.S. imperialism for intensifying its armed intervention and aggression in Laos.

The statement said: "The Lao Patriotic Front Party and the Lao people resolutely oppose and condemn U.S. imperialism's intervention in Laos, trampling on Lao sovereignty, and violating the United Nations Charter and international law. The Lao Patriotic Front Party and the Lao people regard U.S. imperialism's military aid to the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group as intervention in Laos. The Lao Patriotic Front Party and all the Lao people will carry out resolute opposition."

The statement said, "The Lao Patriotic Front Party calls on all the people and all patriotic and peace-loving forces to unite closely and struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group and to thoroughly defeat them. The Lao Patriotic Front Party calls on the people of the world and peace-loving and democratic forces to support Laos in order to stop U.S. imperialism's aggression and defend the peace of Laos, Indochina, and Southeast Asia."

The statement revealed that after Parsons' activities in Laos, U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of Thailand and South Vietnam have vigorously assisted the rebel group in every crude and blatant way to attack the Kingdom of Laos' government and people. The statement said that their malicious intention is to conspire for armed intervention in Laos.

The statement pointed out that U.S. imperialism's so-called "aid" to Laos is actually aid to the Phoumi Nosavan rebel group. U.S. imperialism has provided a total of 16 million U.S. dollars to the Phoumi Nosavan group and has transported weapons to this group from Thailand and South Vietnam. For this purpose, U.S. imperialism has also directly helped the Phoumi Nosavan group build airports and open up new air routes. At the same time, U.S. imperialism has also sent officers to train and command the rebel group's army and sent foreign troops into the Phoumi group's army in order to prepare to attack Vientiane.

The statement revealed a large number of facts about U.S. military officers helping the rebel group train troops, survey terrain, and formulate combat plans in various places. It then pointed out that, more seriously, at the end of October this year, the People's Armed Forces obtained a secret order No. 623LH of October 19, 1960, signed by the commander of the First Military Region. This order ordered the garrisons in various parts of Phongsaly province to receive the so-called "Eighth Commando Volunteer Army" specially sent by foreign countries.

The statement pointed out that the fact that U.S. planes were used to transport foreign troops to Laos to cooperate with the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group to oppose the Lao government and people proves that U.S. imperialism is directly interfering in Laos, trampling on Lao sovereignty, and violating the United Nations Charter, international law, and the Geneva Agreements. U.S. imperialists, with the ambition of turning Laos into its new type of colony and a base for aggression in Southeast Asia, are using foreign reactionary groups as their tools to realize their sinister plot of using Lao people to fight Lao people, undermining peace and neutrality, national harmony, subverting the Kingdom's legitimate government, provoking and prolonging the Lao civil war, and creating tension in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The statement pointed out that the above-mentioned blatant interference by U.S. imperialists has brought serious disasters to Laos and the entire Southeast Asian region.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 14th. According to a broadcast by the Voice of the Fighting Units of Laos today: people across Laos continue to hold rallies to support the Souvanna Phouma government's policy of peace and neutrality and oppose the Phoumi Nosavan group's traitorous conspiracy.

7,000 residents of Bassen County, Luang Prabang Province, and more than 2,000 residents of all ethnic groups and strata in Bulapha County, Khammouane Province, have recently held rallies separately and passed hundreds of suggestions to the Souvanna Phouma government. These suggestions demanded that the Souvanna Phouma government achieve genuine peace, neutrality, and national harmony; demanded the establishment of diplomatic relations with neighboring countries; resolutely opposed the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group's conspiracy to attack Vientiane; and opposed the Phoumi Nosavan traitorous group's orders to its pawns in various places to force young people into the army and suppress the people.

    老挝爱国战线党谴责美国支持诺萨万集团进行武装叛乱
    号召人民团结起来击败美国干涉
    老挝各地人民集会要求政府实现和平中立与民族和睦政策
    新华社河内14日电　寮国战斗部队电台今天广播了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人的声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义加紧武装干涉和侵略老挝。
    声明说：“老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民坚决反对和谴责美帝国主义对老挝的干涉，蹂躏老挝主权，违反联合国宪章和国际公法的行为。老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民把美帝国主义对富米·诺萨万叛乱集团的军事援助看作是对老挝的干涉。老挝爱国战线党和全体老挝人民将进行坚决的反对。”
    声明说，“老挝爱国战线党号召全体人民和各个爱国、爱和平的力量紧密地团结起来，为反对美帝国主义和富米·诺萨万叛国集团而斗争，并把它们彻底击败。老挝爱国战线党呼吁世界人民和爱好和平民主的力量支援老挝，以制止美帝国主义的侵略，保卫老挝、印度支那和东南亚的和平。”
    声明揭露，在帕森斯到老挝活动以后，美帝国主义及泰国和南越的反动派通过一切粗暴和明目张胆的形式来大力帮助叛乱集团，进攻老挝王国政府和人民。声明说，它们的恶毒意图是阴谋武装干涉老挝。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的所谓“援助”老挝，实际上是援助富米·诺萨万叛乱集团。美帝国主义到现在一共向富米·诺萨万集团提供了一千六百万美元，并从泰国和南越向这个集团运送武器。为此目的，美帝国主义还直接帮助富米·诺萨万集团建造飞机场，开辟新航线。同时，美帝国主义还派遣军官训练和指挥叛乱集团的军队，派遣外国军队进入富米集团的军队，以便准备进攻万象。
    声明揭露了美国军官在各地帮助叛乱集团训练部队、侦察地形和制订作战计划的大量事实，然后指出，更严重的是，在今年10月底，人民武装力量曾获得一份第一军区指挥官签署的1960年10月19日第623LH号密令。这项密令命令丰沙里省各地驻军接收外国特别派来的所谓“第八号突击队志愿军”。
    声明指出，用美国飞机载运外国军队到老挝，同富米·诺萨万叛国集团配合来反对老挝政府和人民的事实，证明美帝国主义直接干涉老挝，蹂躏了老挝的主权，违反了联合国宪章和国际公法以及日内瓦协议。美帝国主义者怀着把老挝变为它的新型殖民地和在东南亚的侵略基地的野心，它利用外国反动集团作为它的工具来实现其以老挝人打老挝人，破坏和平中立、民族和睦，颠覆王国的合法政府，挑起和延长老挝内战，制造印度支那和东南亚的紧张局势的毒辣阴谋。
    声明指出，美帝国主义者的上述明目张胆的干涉给老挝和整个东南亚地区带来了严重的祸害。
    新华社河内14日电　据寮国战斗部队电台今天广播：老挝各地人民继续举行集会，支持富马政府的和平中立政策，反对富米·诺萨万集团的叛国阴谋。
    琅勃拉邦省巴森县七千居民、甘蒙省布拉发县各族、各阶层二千多居民最近都分别举行集会，通过了寄给富马政府的成百份建议书。这些建议书要求富马政府实现真正的和平中立和民族和睦；要求同各邻国建立外交关系；坚决反对富米·诺萨万叛国集团进攻万象的阴谋；反对富米·诺萨万叛国集团命令各地爪牙强迫青年当兵、镇压人民的行动。
