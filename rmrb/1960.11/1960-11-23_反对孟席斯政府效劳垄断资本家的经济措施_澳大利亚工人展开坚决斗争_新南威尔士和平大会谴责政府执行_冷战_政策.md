    Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd dispatch from Sydney: Australian workers are opposing the Menzies government's recently announced economic measures that serve monopoly capitalists. A thousand dockworkers in Adelaide held a rally demanding the government's resignation. The Central Council of the Australian Miners' Federation also called on workers to intensify their organizational work to defeat the Menzies government.
    To cope with the serious economic crisis it faces, the Menzies government announced last week that it would take some new economic measures, including tightening bank credit, raising bank overdraft rates, and increasing sales taxes on various vehicles. Recently, due to falling exports and rising imports, the Australian government's foreign exchange surplus has fallen sharply.
    The Central Council of the Miners' Federation criticized the government's new measures, saying that the government's policies can only have adverse effects on workers, small farmers, and small business people. Dockworkers pointed out at the rally that the excess profits of monopoly capital are the main cause of inflation. They all accused the government's economic policies of serving monopoly capitalists without being able to solve the problem of inflation.
    Australia's current economic situation and the measures taken by the Menzies government have also caused unease among many business people in Australia. According to a spokesman for the automobile industry, the industry will have to lay off 5,000 people. The Federal President of the Australian Manufacturers' Association, Anderson, warned on the 18th that the government's new measures "may drastically inhibit economic development" and "will cause the collapse of industry."
    Xinhua News Agency, November 21st dispatch from Sydney: The New South Wales Council for International Cooperation and Disarmament Peace Committee, at a peace congress held in Sydney on the 19th, pointed out that the Australian government's subservience to the "Cold War" policies of the United States and Britain has been widely criticized, and that this policy affects the living standards and democratic rights of the Australian people. Approximately two hundred and twenty-five delegates and observers attended the congress, including ninety-five representatives of the trade union movement.
    The congress called on people from all walks of life in Australia to strive to change the government's foreign policy. The congress pointed out that if the government does not automatically change its policy, "then peace-loving people, regardless of their political affiliation, should unite to force a change in the government."
    The congress demanded that all nations enjoy the right to self-determination, advocated that Australia be friendly with all countries, especially with China and other Asian countries. The congress also condemned the United States' policy against Cuba.

    反对孟席斯政府效劳垄断资本家的经济措施
    澳大利亚工人展开坚决斗争
    新南威尔士和平大会谴责政府执行“冷战”政策
    新华社22日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚工人反对孟席斯政府最近宣布的为垄断资本家效劳的经济措施。阿得雷德一千名码头工人曾为此举行集会，要求政府辞职。澳大利亚矿工联合会中央理事会也号召工人要为击败孟席斯政府加紧进行组织工作。
    孟席斯政府最近为了应付面临的严重经济危机，在上星期宣布要采取一些新的经济措施，其中包括紧缩银行信贷、提高银行透支利率和增加各种车辆的销售税等。最近以来，由于出口下降、进口上升，澳大利亚政府的外汇结余已经剧烈下降。
    矿工联合会中央理事会抨击政府这一新措施说，政府的政策只能对工人、小农和小商人产生不利影响。码头工人在集会上指出，垄断资本的超额利润是通货膨胀的主要原因。他们都指责政府的经济政策是为垄断资本家效劳，而没有能解决通货膨胀问题。
    澳大利亚目前的经济情况和孟席斯政府所采取的措施，也引起澳大利亚许多企业界人士的不安。据汽车工业的发言人说，这个工业将不得不解雇五千人。澳大利亚制造商联合会联邦会长安德逊在18日警告说，政府的新措施“可能剧烈地抑止经济的发展”，“将引起工业的崩溃。”
    新华社21日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚新南威尔士争取国际合作和裁军和平委员会19日在悉尼举行的和平大会指出，澳大利亚政府屈从于美、英两国的“冷战”政策的做法受到普遍的抨击，这种政策影响澳大利亚人民的生活水平和民主权利。参加这次大会的大约有二百二十五名代表和观察员，其中九十五名是工会运动的代表。
    大会号召澳大利亚各阶层人民力求改变政府的外交政策。大会指出，如果政府不自动改变它的政策，“那么，拥护和平的人们，不管属于什么政党，应该联合起来迫使改变政府”。
    大会要求让一切民族都享有自决权，主张澳大利亚同一切国家友好，特别是同中国和其他亚洲国家友好。大会还谴责美国反对古巴的政策。
