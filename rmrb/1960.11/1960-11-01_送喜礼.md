Sending Wedding Gifts (West River Big Drum)
Sun Laikui

The great changes in the new socialist countryside let me tell you about Jianming Commune in Zunhua County. One day, Director Wang said to everyone:
	“In the past few years, there have been so many weddings in our commune, it’s always a hassle. I think it's too cumbersome. How about we tally up the number of people getting married and have a joint wedding? It'll be lively and joyous.” The commune members all agreed, so Director Wang took a count of the people getting married and chose a date for a joint wedding. That day was truly lively beyond compare. Twenty-four girls were married off simultaneously, and twenty-four young men took wives at the same time. There was also an old man named Wang Dafu, who found an old companion in her forties. He and her also held their wedding at the same time as these young people, beaming with joy on the stage. On both sides were twenty-four couples standing shoulder to shoulder, and in the middle were Wang Dafu and his wife. The wedding officiant was Vice Director Du Kui, who was both funny and eloquent. He said, “Comrades: Today is a great day. Look at this, it’s almost like watching a play. We have 'xiaosheng' and 'qingyi' (male and female lead roles in Chinese opera), and I'll take care of the musical accompaniment.” The commune members laughed heartily, some even crying with laughter and coughing. Du Kui continued, “We should be happy today because we could never have seen anything like this in the old society. Uncle Wang, a 'bachelor' since he was young, is now over fifty and is celebrating a 'minor advancement'. On behalf of all the commune members, I propose that Uncle Wang tell us about his courtship process.” Everyone agreed and asked the old couple to share their story. Old Wang was really flustered, his eyes darting around, thinking, “Oh my! How can I talk about the 'courtship process'?” The old couple looked at each other, and everyone on and off the stage was laughing so hard they couldn't stand up straight. After a long pause, Old Wang finally spoke:
	“Comrades, I'll do whatever you ask, but I'm not good at talking about the courtship process.” The villagers said, “If you don’t tell us, we’ll ask you one question: Why are you getting married?” Old Wang said, “I’m getting married for companionship, it's too lonely living alone.” Everyone said, “If you were lonely, you should have married earlier, why wait until you're over fifty?” This one sentence stirred up Old Wang's sad memories, and tears welled up in his eyes. He said, “Comrades! I always wanted to get married, but I couldn’t have a good life in the old society! I begged for food since I was a child, and when I grew up, I worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord, hoping to earn enough money through hard work to save up and find a wife. But who knew that the landlord's heart was crueler than a wolf, treating the poor with malice and ruthlessness. He complained that we didn’t do enough work even if we were exhausted, and he complained that we ate too much even if we just opened our mouths to eat. If we were sick and couldn't work, we had to record the meals we ate, and if we didn’t have money for medicine, we had to borrow money and pay interest. The interest piled up on top of the principal day and night, endlessly accumulating. I worked year after year to pay off the debt, but I never managed to clear it! I worked for him until I was forty, and I calculated that I still owed him over a hundred yuan. This is like a wheel spinning deeper and the hole getting bigger, and I could never escape his den of tigers and wolves in this lifetime. If it weren’t for the Communist Party, my old life would have been worked to death on his northern slope!” The more the old man spoke, the sadder he became, and everyone in the audience was so moved that they were speechless. Even the newlyweds, who were so happy, had red eyes and were choking with sobs. Du Kui couldn't bear it any longer, wiping his eyes and interjecting, “Comrades, our suffering is in the past, and now we have a good life. Today is a day of great joy, so no one is allowed to cry, we must all be happy! We are happy because we have a new socialist society where bitterness has turned to sweetness, where a bachelor over fifty can also find a wife, and he and these young couples are holding a joint wedding ceremony. Who could have seen such a thing in the old society? It's like seeing an iron tree bloom, and we are all happy from the bottom of our hearts.” This one sentence made the audience burst into laughter again, and Wang Dafu also turned his sorrow into joy, smiling broadly. Du Kui continued, “Let me announce another good news to everyone: Director Wang has come to celebrate the happiness of the newlyweds.” When everyone heard that Director Wang was here, thunderous applause erupted. The applause welcomed Wang Guofan, who was holding three gifts in his hands: the first was an old basket that had been used for many years and was almost falling apart, filled with cornbread made of tree bark and wild vegetables; the second was a sickle with a handle that had been worn thin, and the blade was about to break; the third gift was the best, a red string that was three feet long. The commune members were all stunned, wondering, “What is Director Wang doing? When giving gifts, you should choose good ones, why is he bringing these broken things to sing wedding praises?” Just as everyone was wondering, Director Wang Guofan spoke:
	“Comrades, in the old society, we gave bows and arrows as wedding gifts, but today we will use these three treasures to adorn the table. You young people are so happy getting married, you must all explain the meaning of these three treasures. Whoever explains it correctly can go home and eat wedding noodles, and whoever gets it wrong will eat this tree bark and wild vegetable cornbread!” These three treasures confused the young people, who stared wide-eyed, wondering, “What’s so treasured about this broken basket and broken sickle? Why use tree bark and wild vegetables to make cornbread?” Just as everyone was pondering, a girl named Zhang Yu'e stepped out from the line of newlyweds and said, “Director Wang, I don't know if my thoughts are correct, but I will first explain these three treasures. We used this broken basket to beg for food before liberation, we used this broken sickle to work for the landlord, and this tree bark cornbread is mixed with wild vegetables, which all poor families ate in the past. After liberation, we still used this broken basket to dig wild vegetables, and we used this broken sickle to chop firewood and buy cattle and horses. Today you are using them as wedding gifts, isn’t it to tell us to always remember: when life is sweet, don't forget the bitterness, and when we have plenty, we must still be diligent and do more work.” Director Wang smiled and said, "Correct, now explain the meaning of this red string." The young woman looked at it for a long time, unable to understand. Director Wang then picked up the red string, looked at Yu'e, and said: "This red string is a priceless treasure that Chairman Mao gave us, connecting everyone's hearts to engage in cooperation. Since the establishment of the cooperative, we have been rising step by step and living a good life. When the cooperative was established, we only had three skinny donkey legs, and nothing else. The rich middle peasants ridiculed us as 'poor stick cooperative', saying that we would eventually be so poor that we would have to sell our pots. We are 'poor sticks' but we are stubbornly not breaking up, we must make a name for ourselves to refute them, put forward the slogan: resolutely do not borrow grain from the government and do not take out loans, rely on our own hands to change our poor life! When there is a shortage of food, we tighten our belts and dig wild vegetables, when there is a shortage of agricultural tools, we brave the snow and go up the mountain to chop firewood, use the firewood to exchange for cattle, sheep, and horses, and use the firewood to exchange for large carts. After three years of hard work to the advanced cooperative, our cooperative accumulated the most wealth. Visitors were all moved, saying that we are 'poor sticks' with backbones who are building the mountains and rivers. Especially today, with the establishment of the People's Commune, the face of the poor mountains has been greatly changed. Electric lights and telephones have been installed, and large cars are running in the mountain gullies. Machines irrigate the fields and machines plow the land, and crops and fruit trees cover the mountains. All of this is the result of our determined efforts, hard work, and diligent labor. Having today's good, we cannot forget yesterday's bitterness, and we must also look at the distant prospects of tomorrow. Don't think that because you have started a family and established a career, you should sit down and rest and enjoy a good life. There are still imperialists invading us in the world, and natural disasters still pose a great threat to us. We must continue to work hard and struggle, and do more and say less in everything. The vegetable basket is always a family heirloom, and the broken sickle must be sharpened regularly. When we reach the communist society, that is our ideal happy life." Director Wang became more and more enthusiastic as he spoke, and the young people were so excited that they scrambled to speak. Girl Yu'e grabbed the first opportunity to speak and said: "Comrades: I will tell you my determination. I am determined to build my hometown well and drive fast with everyone to the communist society. Good days should still be lived like poor days, and when we encounter difficulties, I will think about how we lived in the past. I am determined to taste this cornbread made of tree bark today to express my determination!" As she spoke, she reached out to take it, and the young people were all anxious, all treating the act of eating the cornbread as a declaration,抢的抢来夺的夺. When Director Wang saw this, he quickly stopped them, saying: "Do not eat it, take it home and put it away. If you have any opinions about labor, take it out, look at the cornbread made of tree bark, look at the cornbread and then look at this family heirloom, and you will surely have more motivation." When the young people heard this, they all said, "That's right, we must preserve this family heirloom for generations to come!" The director also said, "I would like to make another suggestion today, that is, our wedding is not happy enough, we peasants do not know how to dance social dances, why don't we have the new brides and grooms dance a Yangko dance?" Everyone agreed and pulled and dragged each other. Just as people were making a fuss, several large trucks drove up the street. The commune transported fertilizer powder, at least ten tons. Everyone immediately ran out, happily unloading the trucks. This is: A small excerpt from Wang Guofan's wedding gift, next time, we will continue with opening mountains and splitting ridges.

    送喜礼（西河大鼓）
    孙来奎新中国山乡农村大变革，让我把遵化县建明公社说一
  说。这一天，王主任对着大家讲：
  “这几年咱社里结婚的特别
  多，三天两头办喜事，我总觉这事太罗嗦，是不是，咱把结婚的人数统计
  一下，同时结婚，又热闹来又欢乐。”社员们一听全说好，王主任就把结婚的人数摸了一
  摸，择了一个日子办喜事，这一天，可真是热闹的了不
  得。二十四个姑娘同时出嫁，二十四个小伙同娶老婆，还有一个老头叫王大富，也找了个老伴四十多，他二人，也和这伙青年同时举
  行婚礼，跑到台上闭不住嘴的乐。在两边，是二十四对夫妻膀靠
  着膀，在当中，是王大富和他的老婆
  儿。主婚人，就是杜奎副主任，他的脾气是又好笑来又好说，他言道：“乡亲们：咱今天可
  是个好日子，你们看吧，真好像唱戏差不多。这台戏小生、青衣全都有，文武场面我负责。”逗的社员们哄哄笑，真有的人乐得流泪儿又咳嗽。杜奎又说：“咱今天应该这么
  乐，在旧社会，这种事做梦也看不
  着。老王大叔，从小的‘光棍’五
  十多岁，今天也来了个‘小登科’。我代表全体社员提个建议，请王大叔把恋爱的过程说一
  说。”大家一听全说对，叫他老两口都得说说。王老头可急的真够呛，瞪着两眼无着落，我那娘啊！这“恋爱的过程”
  可怎么说？这老两口，是你看我来我看
  你，台上台下，人们都乐的直不起
    脖儿。呆了半天，老王这才说了话：
  “乡亲们，你们提啥我都依
  着，这恋爱的过程我不好说。”乡亲们说：“既不讲我们就问
  你一句，你娶媳妇为什么？”老王说：“我娶妻为的是和我
  作伴，一个人过日子太寂寞。”大家说：“嫌寂寞你就该早点
  娶，为什么等到五十多？”一句话勾起了老头的伤心事，泪水滚滚湿了眼窝，说：“乡亲们！我早就想着把
  妻娶，旧社会哪里有我的好生活！我从小记事就要饭，长大后就给地主扛长活，实指望靠劳动挣钱好好的干，积攒上几个钱寻个老婆，怎知道地主的心肠比狼狠，对穷人处处毒辣又刻薄，累死人，他还嫌活干的少，吃饭时，一张嘴就嫌吃的多，累病歇工吃饭得记账，吃药没钱借债还得把利息搁，钱上加钱利上加利，昼夜不停往上罗，我是年年干活年年还账，哪一年也没有还利索！在他家我扛活扛到了四十岁，算了算倒欠下他家一百多，这叫做轱辘越深窟窿越大，这一辈子也逃不出他这虎狼
  窝。要不是来了共产党，我这老命也得累死在他家的北
  山坡！”老头越说越讲越难过，全场的人都感动的没有话说，新婚的青年们那么高兴，这时间，也都眼圈发红楞柯
  柯。杜奎看着可沉不住气，擦擦眼插嘴就把话说：“乡亲们，咱受苦受罪是过去
  的事，现在可过上了好生活。今天又是个大喜之日，我们大家，谁也不准掉泪都得
  乐合！我们乐的是，苦去甜来的新社
  会，五十多的光棍也有了老婆，又和这些青年夫妻们同时举行
  结婚典礼，这种事在旧社会里有谁能见
  过？这就叫铁树开花围着看，从心里都喜的了不得。”这一句话又逗的会场里哄堂
  笑，王大富也转悲为喜笑呵呵。杜奎又说：“再给大家报个喜
  讯，咱王主任前来庆贺新人的幸福
  生活。”大家一听王主任到，风雨般的掌声震耳膜。掌声迎出了王国藩，有三件礼品在手中托：头一件，是多年的破篮子都快
  掉底，里边装着树皮野菜做的窝窝；第二件，是一把镰刀，把都全
  磨细，镰头用的也快要折；顶数第三件礼品好，是一根红线三尺多。社员们看着全发楞，心里说：“王主任这可是干什
  么？送礼品就该拣着好的送，怎么抱着些个破烂来念喜歌？”一个个心中正纳闷，王国藩主任把话说：
  “乡亲们，旧社会结婚送弓箭
  斗，咱今天就用这三宝来压桌，你们年轻人结婚这么高兴，都得把这三件宝的意义说一
  说，谁说的对，谁就回去吃喜面，说不对，就吃这树皮野菜窝
  窝！”这三件宝把青年们闹了个莫名
  其妙，都大瞪着两眼儿光捉摸，心里想：这破篮子破镰算什么
  宝？为什么还用树皮野菜做窝窝？一个个心中正盘算，新人队里走出来姑娘张玉
  娥，说：“王主任，也不知我想的
  对不对，我先把这三宝说一说。这破篮子解放前咱用它要过
  饭，这破镰刀咱用它给地主做过
  活，这树皮窝窝还掺着野菜，在从前咱穷人家家都吃这个。解放后还用这破篮子挖过野
  菜，用这破镰砍柴禾买来的牛马
  车，到今天你用它给我们当贺礼，是不是叫我们永远要记着：人到甜时别忘了苦，到多喒也要勤俭多做活。”王主任一听笑了笑，说：“对，你再把这根红线的
  意义说一说。”大姑娘看了半天难理解，王主任才拿起红线看看玉娥，说：“这根红线是毛主席给咱
  的无价宝，把大家的心串连到一起搞合
  作。自从成立了合作社，我们才步步登高过好了生活。建社时，我们只有三条瘦驴
  腿，别的要什么没什么。富裕中农讥笑我们为‘穷棒子
  社’，说咱们早晚得穷的卖了锅。咱们是‘穷棒子’偏来个穷不
  散，一定要搞出个名堂来把他们
  驳，提出口号：坚决不向政府贷粮
  也不贷款，凭双手要改变我们的穷生活！缺粮吃我们紧紧腰带挖野菜，少农具咱们冒着雪上山砍柴
  禾，用柴禾换的牛羊马，用柴禾换来的大轮车，苦战了三年到高级社，数咱社积累的财富多。参观的人个个都感动，说咱们是‘穷棒子’硬骨头壮
  山河。特别是今天成立了人民公社，把穷山的面貌又大改革，电灯电话全安上，山沟里也跑开了大汽车，机器浇田机器耕地，庄稼果树满山坡，这都是我们发愤图强埋头苦
  干，艰苦创业勤劳所得。有了今天的好，不能忘了昨天
  的苦，更要把明天的远景也要看着。别认为成家立了业，就应当坐下歇歇享受好生活，世界上还有帝国主义把咱侵
  略，自然灾害对咱的威胁还特别
  多，我们还得继续努力艰苦奋斗，处处多干要少说。挖菜篮永远是传家宝，破镰刀还要经常磨，迈到了共产主义社会，那才是我们理想的幸福生活。’王主任越讲越带劲儿，青年人都激动地抢着把话说。玉娥姑娘发言抢了头一个，说：“同志们：我把我的决心
  说一说，我下决心一定把家乡建设好，同大家往共产主义社会开快
  车，好日子还要当穷日子过，遇困难，我就想想从前怎么生
  活。我为了今天表决心，一定要尝尝这树皮做的窝窝！”嘴里说着就伸手取，青年们全都急的了不得，都把吃窝窝的行动当宣誓，抢的抢来夺的夺。王主任一见忙拦住，说：“不准吃，拿到家里把它
  放着，多喒对劳动有了意见，就取出来，看看这树皮做的窝
  窝，看窝窝再看看这传家宝，准保你马上干劲多。”青年们一听全说对，咱这传家宝要世世代代保存
  着！主任又说：“我今天还要提一
  个建议，就是咱这喜事还不够欢乐，咱庄稼人们又不会跳交际舞，是不是叫新媳妇新郎扭扭秧
  歌？”大家一听全说对，都拉的拉来拖的拖。人们闹的正火热，大街上开来了几辆大汽车。公社里运来了肥田粉，顶少也有十吨多。大家立刻往外跑，欢天喜地去卸车。这就是：王国藩送喜礼一个小
  段，到下回，开山劈岭再接着说。
