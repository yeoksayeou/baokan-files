    (Dispatch from our newspaper) Dugou Brigade of Santun Commune, Ruyang County, Henan Province, based on the principle of unified leadership, three-level ownership with the production team as the foundation, has since the communization, consistently implemented the "Four Fixes" system of land, labor, livestock, and tools for the production teams (editor's note: i.e., production teams, the basic accounting unit of the People's Commune, same below). This allows the production team, while retaining a small portion of ownership, to more proactively arrange production, unleash the enthusiasm of production team cadres and members, and powerfully promote the development of production. The cultivated land area has expanded by 38.5% compared to 1958, and the cropping system has been reformed in accordance with local conditions. Grain output has increased by 28.8%, allowing this poor team to catch up to the level of wealthy teams in the area.
    When the "Four Fixes" were first implemented in 1958, some cadres and members one-sidedly believed that this was adding trouble and that the brigade could not effectively lead the production teams. Some even said: "After communization, everything is for the sake of developing production, and eventually we will transition to commune-level ownership, so why bother fixing things?" The brigade Party branch, upon discovering this situation, immediately launched a blooming and contending discussion, focusing on the ideological and practical problems in implementing the "Four Fixes." On the basis of clarifying right and wrong and unifying ideological understanding, a inspection team was formed, mainly composed of brigade cadres with the participation of poor and lower-middle peasant members, and went deep into the production teams to conduct a comprehensive survey based on the management scope, population, labor force, and living conditions of each production team, starting from the convenience of production. During the survey process, some interspersed plots of land were reasonably adjusted with the consent of the production teams, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. After the land was fixed, the livestock were also ranked and fixed. The entire brigade has a total of sixty-six head of cattle, with each head of cattle bearing an average of 16.5 mu of land. They were fixed to the teams through assessment of their condition and value, and the production teams are responsible for feeding, management, and rational use. Rational allocation of labor is key to ensuring good production. The entire brigade has 265 laborers, with each laborer bearing an average of 4.5 mu of land. They were fixed according to living conditions, labor strength, and technical skill. In the fixing of tools, with the exception of large tools which are uniformly managed and allocated by the brigade, medium and small tools are fixed to be kept and used by the production teams according to the land area, averaging one cart for every 90 mu of land, one drill for every 80 mu of land, and one plow for every 30 mu of land. The implementation of the "Four Fixes" ensures that production is carried out in a planned and orderly manner.
    While implementing the "Four Fixes," a strict production responsibility system was also established and improved. The brigade strictly implements the "three guarantees and one reward" system for the production teams. The production teams implement a "five fixes" responsibility system for the work groups, based on agricultural tasks, which includes fixing tasks, fixing quality, fixing remuneration, fixing acceptance, and fixing rewards and punishments. The income from the production teams’ increased planting on non-arable land and field edges is not included in the brigade's contracted output and belongs to the production teams. (Editor's note: Income from operations outside the contracted output can have a small portion turned over to the production team for unified distribution, with the vast majority belonging to the production team.) After livestock are fixed to the production teams, a "six fixes" responsibility system is implemented, which includes fixing personnel, fixing number of animals, fixing cultivated area, fixing feed, fixing animal condition, and fixing rewards and punishments, as well as a reward system for breeding young livestock. On tools, a system is implemented that includes fixing personnel, fixing the number of items, fixing repair procedures, and fixing the years of use. It is also stipulated that in the event of damage due to work, the method of replacing old with new will be adopted to exchange for or process and repair them at the brigade; the new agricultural tools added by the brigade each year will be appropriately increased according to the specific situation of the production teams. For example, the fourth production team had few vehicles, which affected production, so the brigade immediately helped to purchase two ox carts.
    In order to cooperate and develop production together, after the "Four Fixes" were implemented, it was also stipulated that when production teams cooperate with each other, the principle of mutual voluntariness, mutual benefit, and equivalent exchange should be followed, and small contracting should be carried out according to the contract work standards. For example, the third team drew labor to help the second team dig sweet potato ditches, and the second team paid the third team two workdays per mu of land. During the wheat harvest, the wheat of the second team matured early, while the wheat of the fourth team matured late. The fourth team helped the second team harvest 45 mu of wheat for two days, and the second team allocated 45 workdays. This kind of cooperation not only promoted production, but also strengthened the unity between the teams.
    The implementation of the "Four Fixes" has enabled production to be carried out in a more orderly manner, and the enthusiasm of the members has been fully mobilized. According to the "three guarantees and one reward" system, after the production team completes the planting plan allocated by the brigade, it actively expands the cultivated land area and improves the soil, trying every means to increase income and strive for overproduction. The first production team has arranged agricultural work properly and has expanded the cultivated land area by about 40% over the years, and has always been an overproduction team. In this year's autumn sowing, the members fought a major battle on Laoniu Slope, reclaiming more than 50 mu of wasteland. The 60 mu of land on the original Nanya Slope, which had thin soil and thick rocks, had the soil improved after increasing the application of fertilizer, and the corn grew exceptionally well this autumn. At the same time, the members' love for public property has also become a common practice. Liu Jinfu, a member of the first production team, always wipes his hoe and iron shovel clean every time he returns from the field. He has used a hoe for three years and it is still solid. Meng Changan, a feeder, in order to protect the livestock and ensure the quality of plowing, adopted the method of plowing the land while watching the soil and the cattle, plowing quickly and well. The entire brigade carried out the autumn harvest this year meticulously and cleanly. Wheat sowing has been completed, and the sowing quality is better than any previous year.

    杜沟大队坚持统一领导三级所有队为基础制度
    实行“四固定”发挥小队积极性
    两年来耕地面积扩大，粮食产量增长，赶上富队水平
    本报讯　河南汝阳县三屯公社杜沟大队（编者注：即生产队，是人民公社的基本核算单位，下同）根据统一领导，三级所有，队为基础的原则，自公社化以来，对生产队（编者注：即生产小队，是人民公社组织生产的基层单位，下同）坚持执行了土地、劳动力、牲畜、工具“四固定”制度，使生产队在保有小部分所有制的条件下，能更主动地安排生产，发挥生产队干部和社员的生产积极性，有力地促进了生产的发展。耕地面积在1958年的基础上扩大了38.5％，并因地制宜改革了耕作制度，粮食产量增长28.8％，使这个穷队赶上了当地的富队水平。
    1958年实行“四固定”开始的时候，个别干部和社员曾片面地认为，这是增加麻烦，大队不能很好领导生产队。有的还说：
  “公社化后，都是为了发展生产，终究要向公社一级所有制过渡，何必固定。”大队党支部发现这种情况，立即针对实行“四固定”中的思想问题和实际问题，发动群众开展鸣放讨论。在明辨是非，统一思想认识的基础上，以大队干部为主吸收贫农社员参加，组成了检查组，深入生产队，根据各生产队的管理范围、人口、劳动力、居住条件等，从便利生产出发，进行全面调查。在调查过程中，对一些插花地，在平等互利和生产队同意下进行了合理调整。土地固定后，对牲畜也进行了排队固定。全大队共有六十六头牛，每头牛平均担负土地十六点五亩，通过评膘、评价固定到队，由生产队负责饲养管理和合理使役。合理安排劳动力是保证搞好生产的关键。全大队二百六十五名劳动力，平均每个劳动力担负四点五亩土地，根据居住条件、劳动力强弱、技术高低进行固定。在工具的固定上，除大型工具由大队统一管理、分配外，中、小型工具根据土地面积，固定由生产队保管使用，平均每九十亩土地一辆车，每八十亩地一张耧，每三十亩地一张犁。实行了“四固定”，保证了生产有计划、有秩序地进行。
    在实行“四固定”的同时，还建立与健全了严格的生产责任制。大队对生产队严格执行“三包一奖”制度。生产队对作业组，根据农活任务，实行小段包工和定任务、定质量、定报酬、定验收、定奖惩的“五定”责任制。生产队利用非耕地和田边进行增种的收入，大队不列入包产数内，归生产队所有。（编者按：包产以外的经营收入，可以提出小部分上缴给生产队统一分配，绝大部分归生产小队所有。）牲畜固定到生产队以后，实行定人员、定头数、定耕作面积、定饲料、定膘情、定奖惩的“六定”责任制，和繁殖幼畜的奖励制度。在工具上，实行定人、定件、定修理手续、定使用年限。还规定因工损坏者，采用以旧换新的办法，到大队换取或加工修理；大队每年增加的新农具，根据生产队的具体情况，适当增加。例如第四生产队车辆少，影响生产，大队随即帮助购买牛车两辆。
    为了互相协作共同发展生产，在“四固定”后，还规定生产队与生产队之间进行协作时，本着双方自愿互利、等价交换的原则，按包工标准互相进行小包工。如三队抽出劳动力帮助二队扒红薯沟，二队按一亩地二个工付给三队。在收麦时，二队小麦熟的早，四队熟的晚，四队帮二队两天收麦四十五亩，二队就拨工四十五个。这样协作，既促进了生产，同时增强了队与队之间的团结。
    实行“四固定”，使生产能更有秩序地进行，社员的积极性也充分调动起来了。根据“三包一奖”制度，生产队完成大队所分配的种植计划后，积极扩大耕地面积和改良土壤，千方百计增加收入，争取超产。第一生产队农活安排得当，几年来耕地面积扩大40％左右，一直是超产队。在今年秋播中，社员们大战老牛坡，开荒地五十多亩。原来南崖土薄石厚的六十亩地，经过增施肥料改良了土壤，今年秋季玉米长的格外好。同时，社员爱护公共财产，也形成了风气。第一生产队社员刘金富每次下地回来，总要将镢头、铁锨擦的干干净净，一把镢头他用了三年，还是结结实实。饲养员孟长安为了爱护牲畜，又保证犁地质量，他采用了看土看牛犁地的方法，犁的又快又好。全大队今年秋收搞的又细又净，小麦播种已完成任务，播种质量比过去任何一年都好。
