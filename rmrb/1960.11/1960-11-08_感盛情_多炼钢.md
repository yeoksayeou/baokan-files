    Feeling the Deep Concern, Produce More Steel
    Zhao Yanhe, Worker at Anshan Iron and Steel No. 1 Steel Plant
    Every time we operate those new 140-ton cranes, lifting the large ladles filled with molten steel, we can't help but think of the Dalian-Lushun worker brothers who made these cranes and ladles for us. They really gave our steel plant a big helping hand.
    After our steel plant launched the technical innovation and technical revolution movement this year, the daily steel output of the open-hearth furnaces has greatly increased. Although the crane operators and the workers repairing the steel ladles are busy all day long, they still cannot meet the needs of the open-hearth furnaces. At this time, the Dalian Hoisting Machine Factory sent cadres to our Anshan Iron and Steel, taking the initiative to undertake the task of making the cranes. They also went to the cranes to solicit opinions from the crane drivers, regardless of the hardship.
    After they returned, according to the opinions of our plant's crane drivers, they improved the position of the distribution panel, making the crane more convenient to use. In a very short time, they installed six cranes and transported them to our steel plant.
    These cranes are of excellent quality, easy to operate, safe, and flexible. This has helped us solve the key problem of two open-hearth furnaces not being able to produce steel at the same time. To answer the enthusiastic support of the people of Dalian-Lushun and the people of the whole country, I and my partners will carefully maintain these cranes, check them frequently, and repair them frequently to ensure safe operation, so that the open-hearth furnaces can produce more steel, and complete this year's steel production task with outstanding achievements.

### 感盛情　多炼钢

    感盛情　多炼钢
    鞍钢第一炼钢厂工人　赵言和
    每当我们操纵着那一百四十吨的新吊车，吊着盛满钢水的大罐的时候，就不由得想起旅大工人兄弟给我们做这些吊车、大罐的事。那真是给我们钢厂帮了个大忙。
    今年我们钢厂开展技术革新和技术革命运动以后，平炉每天的出钢量有很大增加。吊车工人和修理钢水罐的工人虽然成天忙个不停，还是满足不了平炉的需要。正在这个时候，大连起重机器厂派干部到我们鞍钢，主动要把制做吊车的任务包下来。他们还不辞辛苦，跑到吊车上向吊车司机征求意见。
    他们回去之后，根据我厂吊车司机的意见，改进了配电盘的位置，使吊车用起来更方便。很短时间，他们就把六台吊车安装起来，运到我们钢厂。
    这些吊车质量呱呱叫，操作起来很方便，又安全，又灵活。这就帮助我们解决了两座平炉不能同时出钢的关键问题。为了回答旅大人民和全国人民的热情支援，我要和伙伴们精心地维护好这些吊车，要勤检查，勤修理，做到安全运转，让平炉多出钢，以出色的成绩完成今年的产钢任务。
