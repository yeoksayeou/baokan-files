Protecting Wild Plants and Improving Wild Plants
Xiaoxian Cultivates Apocynum

Xiaoxian County, Anhui Province, has achieved a bumper harvest of Apocynum this year. Currently, over 1,390,000 jin of dried Apocynum has been harvested, an increase of more than threefold compared to the same period last year.

Apocynum is a high-quality wild fiber that can be used as a raw material for high-grade textiles. However, wild Apocynum grows sparsely, with short and small plants, resulting in low yields. Last year, the Xiaoxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed the County Science and Technology Popularization Committee and other organizations to form a research group to study the cultivation and utilization techniques of Apocynum. The County Committee also cultivated three mu of Apocynum as experimental fields in Majing Commune. After gaining experience, it was decided to carry out artificial cultivation in saline-alkali land and sandy wasteland. In June this year, Majing, Muji, Xinzhuang, Jiudian, and other communes located in the old course of the Yellow River systematically cultivated over 33,600 mu of Apocynum. Apocynum grown through artificial cultivation is densely packed, with thick, tall, and high-yielding plants.

While cultivating Apocynum, various communes also paid attention to protecting wild Apocynum to promote its better growth. To utilize Apocynum, the county established an Apocynum degumming factory and four branch factories to produce fiber for the textile industry. These factories also use the peeled stalks, leaves, and roots of Apocynum to produce pharmaceuticals, activated carbon, and papermaking raw materials. (Illustration: Apocynum) (Image attached)

    保护野生植物改良野生植物
    萧县培育罗布麻
    安徽萧县今年罗布麻丰收。目前已收干麻一百三十九万多斤，比去年同期收获量增加三倍以上。
    罗布麻是一种优良的野生纤维，可作高级纺织品的原料。但野生的罗布麻生长稀疏，麻棵矮小，产量不高。去年中共萧县县委就指示县科学技术普及委员会等组织研究小组，研究罗布麻的培植和利用技术。县委还在马井公社培植了三亩罗布麻作试验田，取得经验以后，便决定在盐碱地和沙荒地进行人工培植。今年6月间，位于黄河故道的马井、木集、新庄、九店等公社有计划地培植了罗布麻三万三千六百多亩。经过人工培植的罗布麻，生长密集，麻棵粗壮、高大、产量高。
    在培植罗布麻的同时，各公社还注意保护野生的罗布麻，使它们生长得更好。为了利用罗布麻，这个县建立了一座罗布麻脱胶厂和四个分厂生产纤维，供应纺织工业，这些厂还利用去皮的麻秆、麻叶、麻根，生产出药剂、活性炭和造纸原料等产品。（插图：罗布麻）（附图片）
