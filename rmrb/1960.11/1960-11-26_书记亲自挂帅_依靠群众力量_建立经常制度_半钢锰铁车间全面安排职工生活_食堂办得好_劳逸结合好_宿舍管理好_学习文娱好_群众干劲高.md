    Secretary Personally Takes Charge, Relying on the Strength of the Masses, Establishing a Regular System
    Comprehensive Arrangements for the Livelihood of Workers in the Semi-Steel Manganese Iron Workshop
    Good Canteen, Good Combination of Work and Rest, Good Dormitory Management, Good Learning and Recreation, High Enthusiasm of the Masses
    (Our Newspaper News) The Banshan Iron and Steel Plant Manganese Iron Workshop Party Committee in Zhejiang Province grasps production with one hand and livelihood with the other. With good arrangements for life, production is done well.
    The main manifestations of the workshop's good livelihood arrangements are: First, the canteen is well-run. The canteen staff wholeheartedly serve the masses, trying every means to ensure that workers eat their fill, eat well, save money, and eat cleanly. The meals are varied, with both dry and liquid options, which are not only delicious but also save grain, making them very popular with the workers. The cooks also work tirelessly to deliver food and dishes to the blast furnace workers three times a day. Second, the combination of work and rest is good. The entire workshop adheres to the "three eights" system: eight hours of work, eight hours of sleep, and the remaining time for learning and recreational activities. Third, the dormitory management is good. Workers on three shifts, single workers, and workers with families are housed separately to avoid mutual interference. Recently, they also solved the problem of thirty-two family dormitories and guest houses on their own, which the workers are very satisfied with. Fourth, after-hours learning is good. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, they study culture for two hours, and 80% of the people participate in the study; on Tuesdays and Thursdays, they study politics, and everyone has conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and other documents. All thirty-four groups in the workshop subscribed to one hundred and seven newspapers and thirty-two magazines, and reading newspapers in their spare time has become a habit for the workers. Fifth, recreational activities are good. The workshop has a reading room and a basketball court, making it convenient for workers to read books and carry out cultural and sports activities.
    With a good grasp of living arrangements, the masses are even more enthusiastic. Compared with September, the quality of pig iron in October increased by 15.2%, the average daily output increased by 28.92%, and the plan was completed eight days ahead of schedule. Production in November continued to rise.
    From the Party committee to the grassroots Party organizations in this workshop, the secretary took personal command. The Party committee collectively studied, and while grasping production, also grasped the comprehensive arrangements for the livelihood of the workers. In addition to regularly educating cadres and relevant personnel on caring for the workers' livelihood, Wang Yuting, the secretary of the workshop Party committee, has focused on canteen work since the third quarter.
    The Party committee pays great attention to giving play to the roles of various functional departments, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations. All kinds of livelihood problems are clearly divided and assigned to specific personnel for responsibility from the workshop to the work section. The workshop also organized a life management committee with the participation of workers, and workers used their spare time to serve as cultural teachers, librarians, and propaganda readers.
    This workshop has gradually established a system for grasping livelihood. The workshop Party committee studies and arranges the livelihood issues of workers when arranging and inspecting the production plan every ten days. All cadres insist on eating with the workers, and the branch secretaries and section chiefs of the work sections take turns working in the canteen for one day each week. The canteen staff has formulated its own code of conduct: be selfless, distribute meals reasonably, treat diners equally; implement democratic management, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and improve work in a timely manner; clear accounts every day, settle every ten days, and announce them every month; cherish all materials; refund all rations to workers on leave or visiting relatives according to the quantitative standard; eliminate pests and pay attention to hygiene, ensuring that the canteen is fly-free, the food is clean, and that workers do not eat raw, cold, or spoiled items, etc.

    书记亲自挂帅　依靠群众力量　建立经常制度
    半钢锰铁车间全面安排职工生活
    食堂办得好　劳逸结合好　宿舍管理好　学习文娱好　群众干劲高
    本报讯　浙江省半山钢铁厂锰铁车间党委一手抓生产，一手抓生活，生活安排得好，生产搞得好。
    这个车间的生活抓得好主要表现在：一是食堂办得好。食堂人员一心为群众，想尽办法让工人吃饱、吃好、吃省、吃干净。每餐饭菜多样，有干有稀，既可口，又省粮食，工人很欢迎。炊事人员还不辞辛劳，一日三次为高炉工人送菜送饭。二是劳逸结合好。全车间坚持执行了“三八”制，八小时劳动，八小时睡眠，其他时间进行学习和文娱活动等。三是宿舍管理得好。三班工人、单身工人和有家属的工人分开住宿，互不影响；最近又自己动手解决了三十二间家属宿舍和招待所，工人很满意。四是业余学习好。每周一、三、五，学两小时文化，80％的人参加了学习；星期二、四学政治，毛主席的“愚公移山”等文件大家都作了认真的学习。全车间三十四个小组订了一百零七份报纸，三十二份杂志，利用空隙时间读报，已经成了职工的习惯。五是文娱活动好。车间设有阅读室、篮球场，工人阅读书籍，开展文化体育活动很方便。
    生活抓得好，群众的干劲更高。10月份同9月份比较，生铁质量提高了15.2％，平均日产量提高了28.92％，提前八天完成了计划。11月份生产又节节上升。
    这个车间从党委到基层党组织，都由书记挂帅，党委集体研究，在抓生产的同时，抓全面安排职工生活。车间党委书记王玉亭除经常对干部和有关人员进行关心职工生活的教育外，三季度以来，重点抓了食堂工作。
    党委很注意发挥各个职能部门、工会、共青团等组织的作用。各种生活问题，从车间到工段，都有明确分工、专人负责。车间还组织了有工人参加的生活管理委员会，并由工人利用业余时间担任文化教员、图书管理员、宣传读报员等工作。
    这个车间已逐步建立了一套抓生活的制度。车间党委在安排和检查每旬生产计划时，都研究和安排职工生活问题。所有干部都坚持和职工同吃，工段支部书记、工段长以上干部，每周轮流下食堂劳动一天。炊事人员自己制订了守则：大公无私，打饭菜要合理，对用膳者一视同仁；实行民主管理，虚心听取群众意见，及时改进工作；账目每天清，十日一结，一月一公布；爱惜一切物资；职工轮休、探亲退伙时一律按定量标准退给；除四害、讲卫生，做到食堂无蝇，食物清洁，保证职工不吃生冷、腐败物品等。
