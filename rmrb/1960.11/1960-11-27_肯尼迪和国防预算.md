    Kennedy and the Defense Budget
    Editor's Note: The American *Christian Science Monitor* published an article on November 17 entitled "Kennedy and the Defense Budget," pointing out that after Kennedy takes office, he will immediately increase military spending in an attempt to alleviate the American economic crisis. The following is a summary of the article:
    What can Kennedy do for defense that Eisenhower has not done or has not already started to do?
    Of the $2 billion that Congress added to the Defense Department against the President's wishes, all but $660 million has now been allocated to weapons development programs.
    In a defense program that devours more than $40 billion annually (more than half of the entire US budget), the remaining funds now cannot accomplish much.
    If Kennedy wants to do something in this area to deeply impress the communists – he said this is one of the main reasons he will further strengthen US state affairs – he will have to ask Congress for funds far exceeding the amount Congress stipulated should be spent this year.
    How to select a variety of weapon programs over a specified period of time so that they complement each other is one of the most difficult problems a president faces during this period.
    If all the plans recommended by the Air Force, Army, and Navy to the Secretary of Defense and the President are approved, the defense budget would be at least half larger than the current budget.
    If Kennedy continues to talk about the need to maintain a balanced budget during normal times, he will find himself making decisions that displease individual military branches, just like Eisenhower.
    No matter how the Pentagon is reorganized, there are always some people who favor one solution, while another group favors the opposite solution, and still another group opposes both solutions and calls for more time to consider what should be done.
    Moreover, there are also members of Congress who have long-standing ties with one military branch or another. There are also large industrial interest groups with huge investments in certain weapons systems.
    Kennedy said: "Defense spending must be considered according to the needs of national security, not according to pre-determined budgetary constraints."
    The progress of economic actions of this scale in Washington is not encouraging. Congressional committees spend an hour, a week, or a month repeatedly questioning Pentagon officials, and they are indeed not very successful.
    Congress has also not found a way to save money and maintain military decentralization as the Congress of this democratic country likes.
    If the judgment of various preliminary signs is correct, Kennedy will, in any case, make great efforts to strengthen the weak links in the defense posture and make the dollars spent provide more defense. A committee headed by Stuart Symington, former Secretary of the Air Force under President Truman and a senator, is now re-examining the possibility of reorganizing the Pentagon.
    Democratic National Committee Chairman, Senator Jackson, and Vice President-elect Johnson are both outspoken on civil defense issues. Jackson is particularly interested in accelerating the development of the "Polaris" missile program. Johnson is particularly interested in military space programs.
    Even if Vice President Nixon had been elected, the funds required by the country's military plans would have exceeded the funds these plans are currently receiving.
    The prospect today is that Kennedy will request an additional allocation in January – perhaps one to two billion dollars – for a variety of military programs, so that each military branch will receive a share of the funds.

### 肯尼迪和国防预算

    肯尼迪和国防预算
    编者按：美国《基督教科学箴言报》11月17日发表了题为《肯尼迪和国防预算》的文章，指出肯尼迪上台后，将立即增加军费，以图缓和美国经济危机。以下是该文摘要：
    肯尼迪能为防务作些什么事，是艾森豪威尔所没有作过的或不是已着手作的呢？
    在国会于总统的反对下增拨给国防部的二十亿美元中，除了六亿六千万美元外，现已完全拨作发展武器计划之用。
    在一个每年吞噬四百多亿美元（占美国全部预算一半以上）的防务计划中，现在下余的款项是办不成多少事情的。
    如果肯尼迪要想在这方面有所作为使共产党人获得深刻的印象的话——他曾说过这是他进一步加强美国国务的主要原因之一——他将不得不要求国会给予一笔远远超过国会规定今年应该花费的数额的资金。
    在规定的一段时间内，如何选定多种多样的武器计划使它们正好互相配合，是一个总统在这段时期中面临的最棘手的问题之一。
    如果把空军，陆军和海军向国防部长及总统推荐的一切计划都统统批准的话，国防预算将会至少比现在预算大一半。
    如果肯尼迪继续谈论正常时期维护平衡预算的必要性的话，他将发现自己像艾森豪威尔那样是在作出一些使个别军种不满意的决定。
    无论五角大楼怎样改组，但是，总是有一些人赞成一种解决办法，而另外一群人赞成相反的办法，还有另一群人对这两种办法都反对而要求以更多的时间考虑应该做些什么事情。
    而且，还有一些与这一个军种或那一个军种有长期联系的议员。也还有一些在某些武器系统中拥有巨额投资的大工业利益集团。
    肯尼迪说过：“必须根据国家安全的需要而不是根据预算上事先决定了的限制来考虑防务开支”。
    在华盛顿这种规模的经济行动的经过情况并不是令人鼓舞的。国会中的各委员会用整整一小时、一周或一个月的时间反复询问五角大楼官员，它们的确是不怎么成功的。
    国会也并没有发现一种既节省经费又能像这个民主国家的国会所喜欢的那样保持军事分权。
    如果对于种种预先的迹象的判断是正确的话，肯尼迪无论如何将作出巨大的努力加强防务地位中的薄弱环节，并使所花费的美元提供更多的防务。以杜鲁门总统手下的空军部长、参议员薛明顿为首的一个委员会，现在正在重新审查改组五角大楼的可能性。
    民主党全国委员会主席、参议员杰克逊和当选副总统约翰逊俩人民防务问题上都是直言不讳的。杰克逊对于加速发展“北极星”导弹计划特别感兴趣。约翰逊则对于军事空间计划特别感兴趣。
    即使是副总统尼克松当选，国家军事计划的情势要求的款项也将超过这些计划目前收到的款项。
    今天的前景是肯尼迪将在1月份要求增拨——也许是十亿至二十亿美元——用于各种各样的军事计划，使每个军种都得到一份资金。
