The delegation visited the workers in the factory working hard to over fulfill this year's plan, and held discussions with young workers and well-known advanced workers.

The young steelworkers of the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works told the delegation that many of them had participated in the Battle of Hill 1211 (called "Heartbreak Ridge" by the US military), which frightened the US military during the Korean War, and they now proposed to increase steel production with the spirit of the Battle of Hill 1211.

The thin plate workshop of this factory completed the entire year's plan ahead of schedule on the evening of the delegation's visit.

Vietnam "People's Daily" Publishes Editorial on South Vietnam Coup: Relying on the People is the Only Way to Overthrow the US-Ngo Fascist Rule; Conflict Between Two Pro-American Groups Cannot Determine the Development Direction of South Vietnam

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 13th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" today published an editorial on the coup in South Vietnam entitled "Unite All Patriotic and Democratic Forces to Overthrow the Ngo Dinh Diem Fascist Dictatorial Group," saying, "The conflict between two pro-American groups cannot determine the direction of development in South Vietnam. The fate and future of our people must be decided by the people themselves."

The editorial pointed out that the coup launched by some army and police units in Saigon has been defeated by the counterattack of Ngo Dinh Diem's army. The heads of the coup forces, who called themselves the "Revolutionary Committee," demanded Ngo Dinh Diem's resignation and the establishment of an anti-communist coalition government. The heads of these coup forces are pro-American elements, and this coup is merely a conflict between two pro-American forces, with US imperialism also intervening.

The editorial said that US imperialism, using its running dogs—the Ngo Dinh Diem ruling group—has established a fascist dictatorship in the South of our country, implementing extremely barbarous terrorist policies, attempting to eliminate the patriotic spirit of our people, and turning the South of our country into a colony and military base of US imperialism. Our people have united and resolutely carried out the anti-US-Ngo struggle, causing them many great losses. The traitorous and harmful nature of the Ngo Dinh Diem group and the hideous face of fascist dictatorship have been exposed. The more they terrorize, the more the spirit of the people's united anti-US-Ngo struggle rises.

The editorial said that the Ngo Dinh Diem group has become increasingly isolated, and some soldiers and staff members in Ngo Dinh Diem's army and government agencies have stood on the side of the people. Due to Ngo Dinh Diem's family rule and cleansing policies, there are various contradictions within their army and government agencies. Some pro-American officers and politicians have used the anti-US-Ngo struggle spirit among the people and the army to launch coups in order to seize personal positions.

The editorial emphasized that, for six years, our people's heroic and tenacious struggle has frightened the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities and shaken its foundations. In order to overthrow the Ngo Dinh Diem group, eliminate the fascist dictatorial system of the US imperialist running dogs, and drive US imperialism out of South Vietnam, and establish a genuine national and democratic government, our people must continue to unite and vigorously promote the struggle movement. We must strive to unite all patriotic and democratic forces and establish a broad, anti-US-Ngo group's democratic united front.

The editorial said: "Faced with the fact that the fascist dictatorial system in the South is in a state of deep panic, our compatriots in the South must strengthen unity and vigorously promote the struggle movement to overthrow the extremely reactionary Ngo Dinh Diem group and save our South from the fire pit. Our people must unite with anyone who opposes the Ngo Dinh Diem dictatorial group. Whoever obeys justice and stands on the side of the people will receive the support of the people. Conversely, whoever wants to follow the path of the Ngo Dinh Diem group, then his future will only be as dark as Ngo Dinh Diem's."

The editorial said, "To oppose Ngo Dinh Diem, we must rely on the people. To rely on the people, we cannot be anti-communist, because the Communist Party is the most patriotic and anti-Ngo Dinh Diem of the people. The main reason for the failure of this coup is that, like the Ngo Dinh Diem ruling group, they hold an anti-communist stance and also prevent the people from overthrowing the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, and at the same time they also believe in US imperialist mediation."

The editorial concluded, "No matter how the situation in the South changes, the people of the South must continue to carry out the anti-US-Ngo struggle to win their legitimate rights. Our people throughout the country are more closely united around our beloved compatriots in the South than ever before, and are always watching the patriotic struggle movement of our compatriots. The heroic and unyielding compatriots in the South must unite and struggle to overthrow the Ngo Dinh Diem fascist dictatorial group and lead our South onto the road of independence and freedom."

    我青年代表团在朝鲜访问
    参观平壤、开城时受到热烈欢迎
    新华社平壤13日电　由中国共青团中央书记处书记李琦涛率领的中国青年代表团连日以来在平壤、开城等地进行了访问，受到了当地人民和青年的热情欢迎。
    代表团在10日和13日分别参观访问了平壤纺织工厂和黄海制铁所，这两个工厂的领导人和青年工人们热烈地欢迎代表团，在工厂的各个车间里都悬挂着欢迎代表团的标语。代表团在工厂内参观了工人们为超额完成今年的计划而努力生产的情形，并同青年工人们、著名的先进工作者们进行了座谈。
    黄海制铁所的青年炼钢工人们告诉代表团，他们中间有许多人在朝鲜战争中参加过使美军丧胆的一二一一高地（美军称之为“伤心岭”）战斗，他们现在提出要以一二一一高地的战斗的精神来增产钢铁。结果，他们最近使钢的日产量达到了八百多吨。这个工厂的薄板车间，在代表团访问的当天晚上就提前完成今年全年的计划。平壤综合纺织工厂的著名的千里马作业班班长金银实和平壤丝织厂的千里马作业班班长吉切实都向代表团介绍了她们在千里马作业班运动中帮助后进赶上先进的经验和事迹。代表团对朝鲜青年工人在生产劳动中建立的功绩和许多宝贵的经验备加赞扬。
    11日，代表团在开城进行了访问。在开城，代表团向朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军烈士陵园敬献了花圈，参观访问了板门店，并同开城的青年们进行了座谈。当天晚上，朝鲜劳动党开城市委员会委员长吴济龙曾设宴欢迎代表团。在代表团离开开城时，吴济龙委员长、朝鲜民主青年同盟开城市委员会委员长全东实等到车站送行。12日，代表团参观了朝鲜祖国解放战争纪念馆。越南“人民报”就越南南方政变发表社论依靠人民才能推翻美吴法西斯统治两个亲美集团之间的冲突决定不了越南南方的发展方向
    新华社河内13日电　越南“人民报”今天就越南南方的政变发表题为“团结一切爱国和民主力量，推翻吴庭艳法西斯独裁集团”的社论说，“两个亲美集团之间的冲突决定不了越南南方的发展方向。我们人民的命运和前途要由人民自己来决定。”
    社论指出，西贡部分军队和警察单位闹起来的政变已经被吴庭艳军队的反攻击败。自称为“革命委员会”的政变力量的首脑们要吴庭艳辞职，成立一个反共的联合政府。这些政变力量的首脑是亲美分子，这次政变只是两个亲美势力之间的冲突，美帝国主义也插手其间。
    社论说，美帝国主义利用它们的走狗——吴庭艳统治集团，在我国南方建立法西斯独裁制度，执行极其野蛮的恐怖政策，妄图消灭我国人民的爱国精神，把我国南方变成美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。我国人民已经团结起来，坚决地进行反美吴斗争，使他们遭受了许多巨大损失。吴庭艳集团的叛国殃民，法西斯独裁的狰狞面目已被揭穿。他们越是恐怖，人民团结反美吴斗争的精神就越是高涨。
    社论说，吴庭艳集团已日益孤立，吴庭艳军队和政权机构中的许多士兵和工作人员有一部分已经站在人民方面。由于吴庭艳的家庭统治和清洗政策，他们的军队和政权机构存在种种矛盾。一些亲美的军官和政客利用人民和军队中的反美吴斗争精神起来搞政变，目的是推翻吴庭艳，以谋取个人地位。
    社论强调指出，六年来，我们人民英勇的和坚韧的斗争，已经使吴庭艳当局发生恐慌，并动摇了它的根基。为了推翻吴庭艳集团，消灭美帝国主义走狗的法西斯独裁制度和把美帝国主义赶出越南南方，建立一个真正的民族、民主政权，我们人民要继续团结和大力推进斗争运动。我们要努力团结所有爱国和民主力量，成立一个广泛的、反美吴集团的民主统一战线。
    社论说：“面临南方的法西斯独裁制度正处于深刻的恐慌状态，南方同胞们要加强团结，大力促进推翻极端反动的吴庭艳集团的斗争运动，把我们的南方从火坑里挽救出来。我们人民要同反对吴庭艳独裁集团的任何人团结一起。谁服从正义，站在人民方面，谁将得到人民的支持，相反，谁要跟着吴庭艳集团的道路走，那末，他的前途只有同吴庭艳的黑暗前途一样。”
    社论说，“要反对吴庭艳必须依靠人民。要依靠人民就不能反共，因为共产党是人民中最爱国和反对吴庭艳的人。这次政变失败的主要原因是，如同吴庭艳统治集团一样，他们据有反对共产党的立场，并且还阻止人民推翻吴庭艳政权的斗争，同时他们还相信美帝国主义的斡旋。”
    社论最后指出，“不管南方局势怎样的变化，南方人民仍然要继续进行反美吴斗争，争取自己正当的权利。我们全国人民比任何时候都紧密地团结到亲爱的南方同胞的身旁，时刻注视着同胞们的爱国斗争运动。英勇不屈的南方同胞们要团结斗争，推翻吴庭艳法西斯独裁集团，把我们南方引向独立自由的道路上。”
