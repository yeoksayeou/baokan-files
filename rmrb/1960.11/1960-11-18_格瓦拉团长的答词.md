Xinhua News Agency, 17th. Reply from Major Ernesto "Che" Guevara, head of the Cuban Revolutionary Government's economic delegation and President of the National Bank of Cuba, at the Capital Airport:

　　Comrades and friends of the great Chinese people:

　　We come here today with a sense of satisfaction. We are here not only to fulfill the mission entrusted to us by our government, but also to fulfill the mission of friendship entrusted to us by our people.

　　As everyone already knows, our two peoples have established diplomatic relations, and before that, we had already established trade relations. This kind of relationship is a normal phenomenon between independent countries. If it were not because Cuba is a country located at the center of world imperialism and was until recently ruled by imperialism, and the People's Republic of China is a country that is being fiercely attacked by imperialism, then this relationship would not be particularly remarkable.

　　Our people are in a difficult stage, but what makes us proud is that our country is the first in the Americas to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. At the same time, we have also established relations with other people's democratic countries in this region of Asia, countries that are completely surrounded by the so-called free world's imperialism. Some people want to conquer us and eliminate us because we are in this so-called free world, making them uncomfortable.

　　When our people faced the danger of a war provoked by imperialism, it was precisely because of the firm support of all socialist countries and the joint efforts of all progressive people that this imminent aggression was prevented. In the process of struggle, our people, like your people in the past, have understood the necessity for all those who are fighting for progress and human welfare throughout the world to unite like brothers. Therefore, the friendship that has just been born between the Cuban people and the Chinese people will be eternal. We thank your great people, your government, and the militia for their welcome to us today. We are convinced that our two peoples will never betray this friendship, and we will move forward together until the final liberation of mankind is achieved. May the eternal friendship between our two peoples last forever!

    格瓦拉团长的答词
    新华社17日讯　古巴革命政府经济代表团团长、古巴国家银行行长埃尔内斯托·切·格瓦拉少校在首都机场上的答词伟大的中国人民的同志们和朋友们：
    我们今天怀着满意的心情来到这里。我们到这里不仅要完成我国政府所委托的使命，同时也要完成我国人民所委托的友谊的使命。
    大家都已经知道，我们两国人民已经建立了外交关系，在这以前我们就已经建立了贸易关系。这种关系本来是独立国家之间的正常现象。如果不是因为古巴是一个处在世界帝国主义的中心、不久以前还受帝国主义统治的国家，而中华人民共和国又是受到帝国主义极力攻击的一个国家，那么这种关系本来也是没有什么特别了不起的。
    我国人民正处在艰苦的阶段，但是使我们感到骄傲的是，我国是美洲第一个同中华人民共和国建交的国家。同时，我们还同亚洲这个地区的其他人民民主国家建立了关系，这些国家完全处在所谓自由世界的帝国主义包围之下。有人想征服我们，消灭我们，因为我们处在这个所谓的自由世界中，使他们感到不舒服。
    当我国人民面临着帝国主义挑起战争的危险时，正是由于全体社会主义国家的坚决支持和一切爱好进步的人民的联合努力，才制止了这一迫在眉睫的侵略。我国人民在斗争的过程中，也像贵国人民过去一样，明白了全世界一切为进步和人类福利而斗争的人们，有必要像兄弟般地团结起来。因此，古巴人民和中国人民之间刚刚诞生的友谊将是永恒的。我们感谢贵国伟大的人民、贵国政府和民兵今天对我们的欢迎。我们深信，我们两国人民永远不会背弃这种友谊，我们将一起前进，直到取得人类的最后解放。祝我们两国人民之间的永恒友谊万古长青！
