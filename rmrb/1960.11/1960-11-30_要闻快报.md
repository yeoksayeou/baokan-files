    News Briefs
    Politics in Command, Output Multiplied
    The Party General Branch of the Liaoshi Coal Mine in Chenxian County, Hunan, organized 85 percent of its cadres to go deep into work teams to conduct ideological education. The general branch secretary and the mine manager divided up the work areas, specifically focusing on one shaft and one team, learning from the advanced teams and finding the reasons for the backward teams, guiding production from specific points to the broader picture. Ordinary cadres also focused on specific examples to explain to the workers the significance of producing more coal to support grain and steel. This greatly increased the workers' enthusiasm, doubling coal production.
    
    Letting Go, Then Picking Up
    "Letting go, then picking up" is one of the methods used by the Wusheng County Committee of Sichuan to strengthen the leadership of rural Party branches. In recent years, the county committee has drawn a group of outstanding Party members and cadres from the leading organs to go deep into the grassroots to work at the branch level; at the same time, it has selected more than 100 outstanding Party members from various branches to serve as branch secretaries. At the beginning of this year, 42 branches across the county were performing poorly, but now 34 have changed their appearance, and the rest have also made great progress. The leadership strength of the branches has been continuously strengthened, promoting production.
    
    Organizing Cadres Sent Down to Study Policies and Theories
    The Party Committee of the Makou Commune in Yongxiu, Jiangxi, organized cadres sent down to study policies and theories regularly. In order to ensure study time, the Party Committee stipulated that they would concentrate on learning once every ten days during the busy farming season and once every seven days during the slack farming season, and seize the time for self-study at ordinary times. Through study, the cadres sent down further cherished rural work and greatly increased their enthusiasm. For example, after the cadre Chen Yanjin, who was sent down, studied the policies of running agriculture in a big way and running grain in a big way, he was determined to be a good leader of the small team, and he took the lead in all kinds of work.
    
    New Leadership Method of the Shipboard Party Branch
    The Party Branch of the No. 55 Fishing Boat Team of the Lushun-Dalian Aquatic Products Company implements the "Two-One" system of leadership, going to sea twice and staying in port once. When going to sea, they fish and live with the masses, discover problems and solve them in time; when staying in port, they study policies, summarize work, and visit the families of employees to help solve ideological and livelihood problems. This further boosted the enthusiasm of the fishermen. They are determined to work hard for 60 days and increase aquatic production by 500 tons.
    
    Collective Dormitory a Sea of Red
    The responsible cadres of the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League of the Longyan No. 2 Steel Plant in Tianjin went deep into the collective dormitories of the employees, and lived, studied, discussed, and entertained with the masses, carrying out "Red Dormitory" activities. Reading groups, cultural groups, theoretical groups, and technical research groups have been established in all dormitories. Not only has it helped employees improve their thinking, but it has also made scientific arrangements for their spare time. This further ensures that employees have both work and rest, and wholeheartedly devote themselves to production.
    
    A United and Loving Family
    The service personnel of the Baiquan County State-run Hotel in Heilongjiang not only warmly arrange the lives of passengers, but also care about their studies. They have specially established a passenger political spare-time school to organize guests who live here for a long time to study in their spare time. Model service worker Liu Yamin also hired lecturers, purchased books and newspapers, and borrowed books for passengers. Here, passengers eat well, live well, and can also study, like a united and loving family.
    
    More Than 400 Cadres "Bringing Charcoal in the Snow"
    Heavy snow is falling. The Wangyin Commune Party Committee of Qufu County, Shandong, organized more than 400 cadres above the brigade level to visit commune members' families in the snow to further arrange the lives of the masses. Where they found that things were not done well enough, they solved them in time. For example, the Thirteenth Small Team lacked firewood, so they immediately helped transport more than 1,000 kilograms of coal. Some old people in the Shahe Brigade Nursing Home lacked socks, so the cadres went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy them. The commune members said: The cadres led by Chairman Mao are even closer than our own relatives!

    湖南郴县蓼市煤矿党总支组织百分之八十五的干部，深入班组进行思想教育工作。总支书记和矿长分工包干工区，具体深入一个井，抓好一个班，从先进班找经验，从后进班找原因，以点带面指导生产。一般干部也紧紧抓住具体事例，向工人说明多产煤对支援粮、钢的意义。这样，工人干劲倍增，使煤产量翻了一番。
    放下去，提起来
    “放下去，提起来”，这是四川武胜县委加强农村党支部的领导方法之一。几年来，县委从领导机关抽调一批优秀党员干部，深入基层作支部工作；同时，从各支部选拔了一百多个优秀党员，担任支部书记。今年年初，全县有四十二个支部工作较差，现在已有三十四个改变了面貌，其余的也有很大进步。支部领导力量不断加强，推动了生产。
    组织下放干部学习政策理论
    江西永修马口公社党委，组织下放干部经常学习政策理论。为了保证学习时间，党委规定农忙时每十天集中学习一次，农闲时七天学习一次，平时抓紧自学。通过学习，下放干部进一步热爱农村工作，积极性大大提高。比如下放干部陈彦进学习了大办农业、大办粮食的政策后，决心当好小队长，各项工作都带头实干。
    船上党支部的新领导方法
    旅大市水产公司五十五号渔轮队党支部，实行“二一”制领导方法，每随船出海两次，就留港一次。出海时，和群众一块打鱼，一块吃住，发现问题，及时解决，留港时，学习政策，总结工作，同时走访职工家属，帮助解决思想和生活问题。这样，进一步鼓舞了渔工干劲。他们决心大干六十天，增产五百吨水产。
    集体宿舍一片红
    天津市龙烟第二钢厂的党政工团负责干部，深入职工集体宿舍，和群众同住、同学习、同商量、同娱乐，开展“红色宿舍”活动。各宿舍普遍成立了读报组、文化组、理论组和技术研究组。不但帮助职工提高了思想，对他们业余生活，也作了科学安排。这样，进一步保证职工有劳有逸，全心投入生产。
    团结友爱的大家庭
    黑龙江拜泉县国营旅社的服务员，不但热情安排旅客生活，还关心旅客学习。他们专门成立了旅客政治业余学校，组织长期住在这里的客人，利用空闲时间进行学习。模范服务员刘雅民，还为旅客聘请讲师、代购书报、借阅书籍。在这里，旅客吃得好，住得好，又能学习，活像一个团结友爱的大家庭。
    四百多干部“雪里送炭”
    大雪正在纷飞。山东曲阜县王因公社党委，便组织大队以上干部四百多人，冒雪访问社员家庭，进一步安排群众生活。他们发现那里做得不够，就及时解决。比如十三小队烧柴不足，立即帮助运来了一千多斤煤。沙河大队敬老院有个别老人缺袜子，干部便亲到供销社去买。社员说：毛主席领导的干部，真是比自己的亲人还亲！
