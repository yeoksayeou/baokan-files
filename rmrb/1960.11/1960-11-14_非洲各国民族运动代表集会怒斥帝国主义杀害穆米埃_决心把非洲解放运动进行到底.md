Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, November 12th: Representatives of African national movements in Cairo tonight strongly condemned the imperialist crime of murdering Cameroonian nationalist leader Félix-Roland Moumié and vowed to continue the struggle for the complete freedom and independence of colonial countries. At a mass meeting held by the African Association in Cairo, the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, and the Arab United Nations National Union, representatives of nationalist parties and groups from Cameroon, Kenya, Northern Rhodesia, Uganda, Zanzibar, Southern Rhodesia, and South Africa, as well as the Algerian Provisional Government and the Arab United Nations National Union, expressed this sentiment.

The representative from Kenya said that Moumié's murder was a new and heinous act of French and American imperialist policy, aimed at eliminating genuine African nationalists who were fighting for the complete freedom and independence of Africans. He said that French and American imperialists are now planning to systematically kill and murder all genuine nationalists in Africa one by one. However, any attempt to eliminate African leaders and revolutions has failed in the past and will not in the future deplete the strength of the struggle of the people of African countries, because they know that the price of Africa's complete freedom is blood and strength. He said, "Each of us is prepared for such a noble and heroic sacrifice, and the African liberation movement will not stop."

The South African representative pointed out, "The increasingly unscrupulous imperialists do not understand that the African struggle is not an individual struggle, but a people's struggle; they can kill our leaders every day, but they cannot stifle the will and creativity of the people."

The representative from Uganda said at the meeting that France and Britain should know that Africans will no longer allow themselves to be enslaved by the enemies of the nation or by reactionaries on the African continent.

The representative from Northern Rhodesia said that France, Britain, and the United States have united the forces of imperialism and agreed to occupy Africa and plunder its resources. They claim that they were the first to come to Africa and therefore believe that it is only right to continue exploiting Africa and plundering its resources. However, they are only deceiving themselves, because Africans have taken note of themselves and their resources.

The representative of the Algerian Provisional Government condemned French imperialism and French fascist groups and called on Africans to unite their struggles and drive imperialism out of Africa and Asia.

The representative of Zanzibar pointed out that the new imperialism, namely American imperialism, is forcibly breaking into Africa. He warned the imperialists, "Your days are numbered."

The representative from Southern Rhodesia said that Africa is determined to eradicate imperialism and colonialism. He said, "We will do this through cooperation, therefore, we must join hands and fight throughout Africa."

    非洲各国民族运动代表集会怒斥帝国主义杀害穆米埃
    决心把非洲解放运动进行到底
    新华社开罗12日电　在开罗的非洲各国民族运动代表今晚强烈谴责帝国主义杀害喀麦隆民族主义领袖穆米埃的罪行，并且誓为争取殖民地国家彻底自由和独立而继续斗争。在开罗的非洲人协会、亚非人民团结组织和阿联民族联盟主持的一个群众大会上，喀麦隆、怯尼亚、北罗得西亚、乌干达、桑给巴尔、南罗得西亚、南非的民族主义政党和团体、阿尔及利亚临时政府以及阿联民族联盟的代表表示了这种态度。
    怯尼亚的代表说，穆米埃的被害是法国和美国帝国主义政策新的罪恶的一手，其目的是企图消灭为非洲人彻底自由和独立的事业而斗争的非洲真正的民族主义者。他说，法国和美国帝国主义者现在已经计划有组织地将非洲所有真正的民族主义者一一加以杀死和谋害。可是消灭非洲领袖和革命的任何企图过去未能、今后也不会使非洲各国人民斗争的力量枯竭，因为他们知道，非洲彻底自由的代价是血和力量。他说，“我们每一个人都准备这样崇高和英雄地牺牲，非洲的解放运动将不会停止”。
    南非代表指出，“愈来愈不择手段的帝国主义者不了解非洲的斗争不是个人的斗争，而是人民的斗争；他们可以每天杀死我们的领袖，可是扼害不了人民的意志和创造。”
    乌干达的代表在会上说，法国和英国应当知道，非洲人决不再容许自己让民族的敌人或非洲大陆的反动分子所奴役。
    北罗得西亚的代表说，法国、英国和美国联合了帝国主义的势力并协议占领非洲和掠夺非洲的资源。它们自称，它们是第一个来到非洲的，因此认为，继续剥削非洲和掠夺它的资源是理所当然的。可是，它们只是在自己骗自己，因为非洲人已经注意到自己和他们的资源。
    阿尔及利亚临时政府的代表谴责法帝国主义和法国法西斯集团，并呼吁非洲人把他们的斗争联合起来，把帝国主义从非洲和亚洲赶出去。
    桑给巴尔的代表指出，新的帝国主义即美帝国主义正在强行冲进非洲。他警告帝国主义者说，“你们的日子屈指可数了”。
    南罗得西亚的代表说，非洲决心铲除帝国主义和殖民主义。他说“我们将通过合作做到这一点，因此，我们必须携手前进，在整个非洲进行斗争。”
