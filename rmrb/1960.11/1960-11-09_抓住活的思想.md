Grasping the Living Thoughts
Yi Qing

When leading cadres go to the grassroots level, whether their work is truly in-depth depends on whether they truly grasp the living thoughts of the cadres and the masses. Grasping this point is grasping the most core and fundamental thing.

After cadres arrive at the forefront of production, some situations and problems, such as whether the weeds in the fields have been cleared, whether enough fertilizer has been applied, whether the attendance rate is high, whether the cafeteria is well-run, and the health of the children in the kindergarten, are generally not difficult to discover as long as they persist in participating in production and leading production. However, some problems are often not visible at a glance or audible with a simple listen. To understand why these specific tasks are done well, and why they are not done well, it is necessary to deeply understand the ideological situation of the cadres and masses who are closely related to these specific issues, and to understand their opinions, demands, and appeals regarding these specific tasks. Because weeds are hoed by people, fertilizer is applied by people, and cafeterias and kindergartens are run by people. If people have a deep understanding of these issues, are motivated, and come up with solutions, the weeds will be cleared, enough fertilizer will be applied, and the cafeterias and kindergartens will be run well. Otherwise, problems will occur. Guo Shengkuan, a cadre of Fengzhuang Commune, was able to quickly apply enough fertilizer to eighty mu of distant and mountainous land after arriving at the Niufengou Production Team because he was not satisfied with the surface situation he saw. Instead, he pursued the matter to the end and thoroughly resolved the cadres and members' thinking of valuing plains and nearby land, and neglecting mountainous and distant land. Once the ideological problem was solved, the problem of applying fertilizer was also solved. It is clear that grasping the ideological problems of cadres and members is grasping the key, and then doing a good job of organizational work can solve the problem faster and better.

It is right to grasp ideology, but why emphasize grasping *living* ideology? Living ideology refers to the specific thoughts of various people on various specific matters. Grasping living ideology is grasping specific thoughts. Because the ideological problems of people are a reflection of the contradictions that urgently need to be solved in our work, and contradictions are concrete. People have different levels of awareness, and their views on specific matters will also vary. For example, regarding fertilizing and raising pigs, cadres and members, this cadre and that cadre, this member and that member may have different ideas. From the perspective of each individual, this month and next month, next month and the month after, their thinking is not static, but will change and develop new specific ideas with the changes in the objective situation. Therefore, if a leading cadre wants to truly do a good job in ideological work, they must not be superficial or simplistic, nor can they fall into subjective randomness. Instead, they must be realistic, down-to-earth, grasp specific thoughts, that is, living thoughts, conduct specific analysis, and solve them specifically, in order to truly do ideological work in the hearts of every person and mobilize all positive factors among the masses.

How can one grasp living thoughts? The experience of Fengzhuang Commune shows that leading cadres must first understand what thoughts cadres and members actually have, which thoughts are correct, and which are incorrect. This requires leading cadres to not only frequently participate in production and lead production, going deep among the masses, but also to gather together to study the Party's guidelines, policies, and theories, and to continuously summarize and research their work. Frequently going deep among the masses allows one to understand what living thoughts are among the masses and why these living thoughts arise. Frequent study and research allow one to understand the Party's guidelines and policies, and to first stand on the position of the Party's guidelines and policies to correctly measure the thoughts of cadres and members, and to praise and educate them. The reason why the cadres of Fengzhuang Commune were able to accurately and firmly grasp the living thought of some cadres and members of the Chenjiagou Production Team who wanted to withdraw labor to build cave dwellings is that they strengthened the system of study, research, reporting, and summary work after implementing the "3-7 system" of leadership methods.

The experience of the cadres of Fengzhuang Commune in going deep among the masses, grasping ideology, and grasping the key is very good. Cadres who go deep into the front line of production should be like them, constantly grasping the living thoughts of people and constantly promoting the progress of production.

    抓住活的思想
    怡清
    领导干部到了基层，工作是不是真正深入，这要看是不是真正抓住了干部、群众的活的思想。抓住了这点，才算是抓住了最核心、最根本的东西。
    干部到了生产第一线以后，有些情况和问题，比如地里的草锄净了没有？肥料上足了没有？出勤率高不高？食堂办得好不好？幼儿园的孩子健康状况如何等等，只要坚持参加生产，领导生产，一般说来，那是不难发现的。但是，有些问题往往不是一看就能看到或者一听就能听到的。对这些具体工作为什么做得好？又为什么做得不好？要了解清楚，就要深入地了解和这些具体问题有密切联系的干部、群众的思想情况，懂得他们对这些具体工作的意见、要求和呼声。因为草是人锄的，肥料是人上的，食堂、幼儿园是人办的。人对这些问题认识得深刻，干劲鼓足了，办法出来了，草就会锄净，肥料就会上足，食堂、幼儿园就会办好。否则，就会发生问题。冯庄公社干部郭生宽到牛粪沟生产队后，所以能很快在八十亩远地、山地上上足肥料，就是因为他没有满足于所看到的表面情况，而是打破砂锅问到底，深入地解决了干部、社员的重视川地、近地，轻视山地、远地的思想。把思想问题解决了，上肥料的问题也就跟着解决了。由此可见，抓住干部、社员的思想问题，才能抓住关键，然后认真地做一番组织工作，就可以使问题解决得更快更好。
    抓思想就对了，为什么要强调抓住活的思想呢？活的思想就是指各种人对于各种具体事情的具体的思想，抓活的思想，就是抓具体思想。因为人的思想问题就是我们工作中急待解决的矛盾的反映，而矛盾都是具体的。人的觉悟程度有高有低，对具体事情的看法也会不尽相同，比如上肥、养猪，干部和社员，这个干部和那个干部，这个社员和那个社员有时会有不同的想法；从每一个人来说，这个月和下个月，下个月和再下个月，他的思想也不是一成不变的，而是会随着客观形势的变化发展而产生新的具体思想的。因此，一个领导干部要真正做好思想工作，就不能表面化，简单化，也不能陷于主观随意性，而要实事求是，踏踏实实，抓住具体思想，即活的思想，进行具体分析，具体解决，才能真正把思想工作做到每一个人的心上，调动群众中的一切积极因素。
    怎样才能抓住活的思想？冯庄公社的经验说明，领导干部首先要了解干部、社员当中究竟有些什么思想？哪些思想是正确的？哪些思想是不正确的。这就要求领导干部既要经常参加生产、领导生产，深入群众，又要集中起来，进行党的方针、政策、理论学习和不断的总结、研究工作。经常深入群众，就可以了解群众当中有些什么活的思想；为什么会产生这些活的思想？经常学习、研究，就可以使自己领会党的方针、政策，首先站在党的方针、政策的立场上，正确地衡量干部、社员的思想，进行表扬和教育。冯庄公社干部所以能既准又狠地抓住陈家沟生产队部分干部、社员想把劳力抽出来打窑洞这一活的思想，就是因为他们在推行“三七制”的领导方法以后，加强了学习、研究、汇报、总结工作的制度。
    冯庄公社干部深入群众，抓思想，抓关键的经验很好，深入生产第一线的干部应该像他们一样，不断抓住人的活的思想，不断推动生产前进。
