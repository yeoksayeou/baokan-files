Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, November 1st: West German Chancellor Adenauer yesterday blatantly stated that West Germany fully supports the United States' plan to turn the North Atlantic Group into a "Fourth Nuclear Strike Force," so that West Germany can more conveniently use nuclear weapons to accelerate the arming of its "Bundeswehr" under a "legal" guise.

Speaking to some West German and British reporters, Adenauer said that he favored the North Atlantic Group establishing its own "nuclear deterrent force." He emphasized that the armed forces of all North Atlantic Group member states, including West Germany, must have the same equipment.

Adenauer claimed that in order to "strengthen" the nuclear armament of the North Atlantic Group, this military bloc must be "reorganized" to strengthen the "integration" of the member states' forces. He said that this way, the armed forces of various countries could act in a coordinated manner in the event of war. He said he was opposed to "each country manufacturing its own atomic weapons." He advocated that the North Atlantic Group member states form a "common institution" to control the group's nuclear weapons, so that the United States and West Germany, supported by the United States, can manipulate them from within.

Sources here point out that the West German government hopes that, through the US plan to turn the Atlantic Group into the so-called "Fourth Nuclear Strike Force," West Germany can have a say in matters related to the use of nuclear weapons.

The "Süddeutsche Zeitung" pointed out in this regard, "If the US plan is adopted, West Germany will be able to hold the hilt of the atomic sword."

    在美国支持下复活军国主义
    阿登纳叫嚷加紧核武装
    要求北大西洋集团成为“第四核打击力量”
    据新华社波恩1日电　西德总理阿登纳昨天露骨地表示，西德完全支持变北大西洋集团为“第四核打击力量”的美国计划，以便西德能在“合法”的外衣下更方便地用核武器加速武装它的“国防军”。
    阿登纳对西德和英国一些记者发表谈话说，他赞成北大西洋集团建立自己的“核威慑力量”。他强调，包括西德在内的所有北大西洋集团成员国的军队，必须有同样的装备。
    阿登纳声称，为了“加强”北大西洋集团的核武装，这个军事集团必须进行“改组”，以加强成员国部队的“一体化”。他说，这样在发生战争时各国军队才能协调行动。他说，他反对“每个国家制造它自己的原子武器”。他主张由北大西洋集团成员国组成一个“共同机构”来控制这个集团的核武器，以便美国以及受美国扶持的西德从中操纵。
    这里人士指出，西德政府指望，通过美国把大西洋集团变成所谓“第四核打击力量”的计划，西德在有关使用核武器的问题上就可以有发言权。
    “南德意志报”就此指出，“如果美国计划被采纳，西德就能够握住原子剑的剑把。”
