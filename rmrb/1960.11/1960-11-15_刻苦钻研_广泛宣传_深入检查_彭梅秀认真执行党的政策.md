Xinhua News Agency report: Peng Meixiu, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Tianhua Brigade in the Fulin Commune of Changsha County, Hunan Province, resolutely implemented the Party's policies and fully mobilized the production enthusiasm of the masses, transforming a poor mountain village lacking grain and money into a red flag brigade with abundant grain, pigs, and money.

Peng Meixiu usually pays close attention to diligently studying the Party's various guidelines and policies. When she attends meetings and listens to reports in the commune, county, and province, she always takes careful notes. If she misses anything, she compares notes with others after the meeting. If she doesn't understand something, she always asks others for clarification. She always reads documents and instructions three to five times. In addition to studying documents, she also diligently studies Chairman Mao's works and regularly reads newspaper editorials. This has greatly improved her policy thinking and ability to analyze problems, increasing her ability to mobilize the masses.

When implementing each policy, Peng Meixiu pays attention to starting from the actual situation. This summer, the Commune Party Committee required that 50% of the late rice be planted with japonica rice and 50% with Hongmi Dongzhan (a type of glutinous rice). After accepting this task, she returned and discussed it with cadres and commune members. Many cadres and commune members reported that late japonica rice was not suitable for planting in Yinzhu Mountain. Poor peasant commune member Peng Xiangcong said to her: "Japonica rice has a long growing period and requires a lot of water. This year, because the early rice seedlings rotted, the harvesting season was delayed, and the water source is not very sufficient. Also, the fields are white sandy mud. If we plant it, I'm afraid it won't be guaranteed. It's more stable to plant Hongmi Dongzhan." Peng Meixiu kept the masses' opinions in mind. She thought: The Party Committee's call to promote late japonica rice is also for the purpose of increasing production, so we must be practical and realistic and not mechanically implement it. She immediately ran to the commune and reported her and the masses' opinions to Party Committee Secretary Liao Guojun, who agreed with her opinion. After Peng Meixiu returned to the brigade, she decided to plant all Hongmi Dongzhan. At the same time, she planted two mu of late japonica rice for experimental fields. Now, the Hongmi Dongzhan has had a bumper harvest and is being harvested, while the two mu of late japonica rice is still dark green.

In order to make the Party's policies meet the masses, Peng Meixiu always publicizes to the masses and checks the implementation at the same time. In September of this year, after the Provincial People's Committee issued the proclamation on running rural public canteens well, Peng Meixiu planted experimental fields for living in the third canteen of the Wenhua Production Team. She worked as a cook in this canteen, doing everything from cooking rice and dishes to planting vegetables. At the same time, she helped the canteen establish a system of "unified management, democratic inspection, food to the hall, quantitative allocation by person, quotas to households, and surpluses belonging to oneself." She also solicited commune members' reflections and demands on the canteen through symposiums and door-to-door visits, and worked with the cooks and clerks to establish the canteen's household affairs. Now, each person in this canteen has a share of vegetable plot, raises nineteen pigs, thirteen poultry, has more than one hundred yuan in savings, and has more than one hundred and thirty catties of surplus grain, making it a red flag canteen in the entire commune. Peng Meixiu promoted the experience here to all the canteens in the brigade, making it bloom universally. Once, she found that the fifth work group of the Dahua Production Team had not posted the proclamation, but kept it in a drawer. After understanding the situation, it turned out that the work group leader Peng Zhenglin had concerns about implementing the policy, fearing that the commune members would take care of the small collective and private matters, hindering the interests of the large collective. Peng Meixiu patiently said to him: "Each of the Party's policies is a collection of the opinions and demands of the broad masses, and is formulated after repeated investigation and research and summary. We issue it to the masses so that the masses can implement it together, which will only promote production. How can you say it will hinder the large collective production?" Then, she introduced to Peng Zhenglin the fact that the third canteen of the Wenhua Production Team had achieved full red in production and life due to the establishment of canteen household affairs. Peng Zhenglin suddenly understood and immediately posted the proclamation and actively publicized and implemented it. Now, according to the spirit of the proclamation, this brigade has transferred 420 pigs from the brigade pig farm, as well as 48 fish ponds and 84 mu of vegetable plots, to help the canteens establish household affairs. In this way, the masses' enthusiasm is even higher, and the large collective production is also doing better.

During the summer harvest distribution this year, according to the brigade's "three guarantees" plan, all three production teams in the brigade overfulfilled their production quotas. Seventeen of the twenty work groups overfulfilled their quotas, two maintained the same level of production, and one decreased production. When it was proposed to award cash and in-kind rewards to the groups and individuals, individual general branch committee members and cadres from the flat-producing and reduced-production teams opposed it. They said this was "dispersing the collective and taking the capitalist road." Peng Meixiu and the majority of cadres resolutely criticized this fallacy, pointing out that the Party's policy is distribution according to labor, more labor, more gain, and rewarding and punishing groups and individuals is precisely the implementation of the Party's policy. From the output value of the overproduction, she extracted 600 yuan in bonuses and 2,800 catties of rice and awarded it to the overproduction groups, which then assessed the bonuses and in-kind rewards to individuals according to labor work points. At the same time, the brigade also allocated a sum of cash to reward the "five-good" commune members in the flat-producing and reduced-production groups. For the reduced-production group, a penalty of 20% of the reduced production was levied. In order to thoroughly realize the "three guarantees," Peng Meixiu and the cadres inspected separately. As a result, it was found that the first work group of the Dahua Production Team kept the bonus and in-kind rewards in the canteen, intending to transfer them for other purposes. Peng Meixiu immediately ordered the work group leader Chang Yehong to assess the bonus and in-kind rewards to the individuals.

Recently, Peng Meixiu participated in the provincial party committee's five-level cadre conference. At the meeting, she received profound policy education and understood more revolutionary principles. After returning to the brigade, she convened a meeting of commune member representatives and mass meetings to thoroughly publicize the commune system and related production policies. The Party's policies have greatly mobilized the enthusiasm of the people, and a new upsurge of vigorously developing agriculture and grain production is surging along the banks of Yinzhu Mountain.

    刻苦钻研  广泛宣传  深入检查
    彭梅秀认真执行党的政策
    据新华社讯　湖南省长沙县福临公社天华大队党总支书记彭梅秀，坚决贯彻执行党的政策，充分调动了广大群众的生产积极性，把一个缺粮、缺钱的穷山窝，变成了粮多、猪多、钱多的红旗大队。
    彭梅秀平时非常注意认真钻研学习党的各项方针政策。她到社、县和省里开会听报告，总是认真作好记录，记不上的部分，会后和别人对笔记。不懂的地方，总要向别人打听清楚，对于文件、指示，总是三遍五遍地阅读。除了学习文件，她还认真学习毛主席著作，经常读报纸的社论。这样，使她大大提高了政策思想水平和分析问题的能力，增加了她发动群众的本钱。
    彭梅秀在贯彻每项政策时，都注意从实际情况出发。今年夏天，公社党委要求晚稻50％插粳稻，50％插红米冬粘。她接受这个任务后，回来和干部、社员商量。许多干部、社员都反映晚粳不适合在隐珠山种植，贫农社员彭香从对她说：“粳稻生长期长，需要水分多，而我们这里今年因早稻烂秧推迟了收割季节，加上水源不太充足，又是白沙泥田，插了怕不保收，还是插红米冬粘稳当些。”群众的意见，彭梅秀记在心里。她想：党委号召推广晚粳，也是为了增产，必须实事求是，不能机械执行。她马上跑到公社，把她和群众的意见反映给党委书记廖国钧，廖书记同意了她的意见。彭梅秀回队后，决定全部种红米冬粘，同时，插了二亩晚粳试验田，现在，红米冬粘丰收了，正在收割。而两亩晚粳还是乌青乌青的。
    为了使党的政策同群众见面，彭梅秀到那里，总是一面向群众宣传，一面检查执行情况。今年9月，当省人民委员会关于办好农村公共食堂的布告发出后，彭梅秀在文华生产队第三食堂种了生活试验田，在这个食堂里当炊事员，煮饭、烹调、种菜什么都干，同时帮助食堂建立了粮食“统一管理，民主检查，实物到堂，以人定量，指标到户，节余归己”的制度，还通过座谈会、登门访问等方法，征求社员对食堂的反映和要求，和炊事员、事务员一起研究，建立了食堂家务。现在，这个食堂每人有一分菜地，养猪十九头，家禽十三只，存款一百多元，还节余粮食一百三十多斤，成了全公社的红旗食堂。彭梅秀把这里的经验在全大队各食堂推广，使它普遍开了花。一次，她发现大华生产队第五作业组没有把布告贴出来，关在抽屉里。经过了解，原来是作业组长彭正林对执行政策有顾虑，怕社员顾了小集体和私事，妨碍大集体利益。彭梅秀耐心地对他说：“党的每一项政策，都是汇集广大群众的意见、要求，经过反复调查研究，总结制订出来的。我们把它发给群众，让群众一道共同执行，只会促进生产，怎么说会妨碍大集体生产呢？”接着，她又向彭正林介绍了文华生产队第三食堂，由于建立食堂家务，生产生活满堂红的事实。彭正林一下心眼明亮了，立刻将布告贴了出来，并积极宣传贯彻执行。现在，这个大队根据布告的精神，从大队猪场下放生猪四百二十头，还下放鱼塘四十八口，菜地八十四亩，帮助食堂建立家务。这样，群众情绪更加高涨，大集体生产也搞得更好了。
    今年夏收分配时，按照大队的“三包”方案，全大队三个生产队都超产。二十个作业组有十七个超产，两个平产，一个减产。当提出以现金和实物奖到组到个人时，个别总支委员和平产、减产队的干部反对。他们说这是
  “分散集体，走资本主义路线”；彭梅秀和大多数干部坚决批判了这种论调，指出：党的政策是按劳分配，是多劳多得，奖罚到组到人，这正是贯彻了党的政策。并从超产的产值中，抽出奖金六百元，稻谷二千八百斤，奖给超产组，超产的组又按劳动工分把奖励金和实物评定到人。同时，大队还拨出一笔现金，奖给了平产、减产组的五好社员。对减产组，罚减产数的20％。为了使“三包”彻底兑现，彭梅秀又和干部分头检查。结果发现大华生产队第一作业组把奖金和实物留在食堂，准备移作别的用途。彭梅秀立即责成作业组长常业洪把奖金和实物评定到了人。
    最近，彭梅秀参加省委召开的五级干部大会，在会上她受到深刻的政策教育，懂得了更多的革命道理。回队后，她召开了社员代表会、群众会，对公社体制和有关各项生产政策进行了透彻的宣传。党的政策大大调动了人民群众的积极性，一个大办农业、大办粮食的新高潮，在隐珠山畔澎湃展开。
