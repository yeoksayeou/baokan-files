    Commentary on the Japanese General Election

    The results of the Japanese House of Representatives election held on November 20 have been fully revealed. The seats held by the Japan Socialist Party and the Japan Communist Party have significantly increased, and the Liberal Democratic Party's plan to seize more than two-thirds of the seats has been thwarted. This is a victory for the patriotic and democratic forces and the people of Japan, and it demonstrates the firm will of the broad masses of the Japanese people to strive for independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality.

    The focus of this general election was the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and the issue of neutrality; it was a serious struggle between the Japanese people who demanded independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality, and the U.S.-Japan reactionaries who implemented the U.S. policy of aggression, insisted on the U.S.-Japan military alliance, and intensified militarization. According to the final announced results, out of the total of 467 seats in the House of Representatives, the Socialist Party won 145 seats, an increase of 23 seats. Japanese Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda boasted before the election that he would "suppress the Socialist Party to below 100 (members of the House of Representatives)," but he failed. The Japan Communist Party increased from its original one seat to three seats, and the total number of votes received increased by more than 144,000 compared to the previous general election. However, the number of seats held by the right-wing Democratic Socialist Party, which split from the Socialist Party, plummeted from the original 40 seats to 17 seats. The number of seats obtained by the Liberal Democratic Party was not the 320 seats that Hayato Ikeda had repeatedly boasted of "definitely" obtaining, but only 296 seats.

    Anyone who has a little contact with the actual situation of this general election can easily understand the difficulties under which the above-mentioned progress of the Japan Communist Party and the Socialist Party was achieved. The U.S.-Japan reactionaries adopted various despicable means to manipulate the election during the campaign. On the one hand, they tried their best to publicize that the Ikeda government was "different from Nobusuke Kishi," concealed its reactionary essence, and tried every means to win over people's hearts. On the other hand, the Ikeda government specially convened a national meeting of police chiefs, mobilized 18,000 criminal police and 50,000 plainclothes police to strengthen the suppression of democratic forces; and instigated fascist thugs to assassinate Socialist Party leader Inejiro Asanuma, and promulgated reactionary decrees to deprive the people of the right to assemble and march, restrict freedom of election, and hire a large number of fascists to sabotage the election activities of progressive parties. The U.S.-Japan reactionaries particularly concentrated their efforts to attack the Communist Party, and adopted the most brutal and shameless means to sabotage the JCP's election activities. The Japanese monopoly capital group invested more than 2 billion yen in campaign funds to win votes for the Liberal Democratic Party, greatly exceeding previous records. Even the Japanese bourgeois newspapers could not help but regard this situation as "the largest money and power election since the war." The U.S. government also openly interfered in Japan's internal affairs. U.S. Secretary of State Herter and U.S. Ambassador to Japan MacArthur II successively issued statements expressing their support for the Liberal Democratic Party; the U.S. Senate "Internal Security Subcommittee" also submitted a report during this period slandering the Japan Communist Party and the Socialist Party in an attempt to influence the Japanese election.

    It is very obvious that under the strict control of the Japanese monopoly capital group, when the army, police, intelligence agencies, and even propaganda tools such as newspapers and radio stations are all controlled by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and the U.S. imperialist army is stationed throughout Japan, how can there be any real free election? The people's freedom in the election is extremely limited; the people's will cannot be fully expressed through the election.

    It is precisely based on such a correct understanding that the patriotic and democratic forces and the broad masses of the Japanese people have never estimated that the results of this general election would lead to the number of seats held by patriotic and democratic forces exceeding those of reactionary forces. It is generally believed that as long as no unexpected situation occurs, the Liberal Democratic Party will occupy a majority of the seats, and the Ikeda government will reappear. At the same time, it is also pointed out that the patriotic and democratic forces will inevitably show through this election the strength they have strengthened in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance.

    The results of this election fully prove the correctness of the above viewpoints and estimates. As Japanese Communist Party Chairman Sanzo Nosaka said, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which carried out joint struggles in the struggle against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," have made significant progress; in contrast, the Democratic Socialist Party, which opposed neutrality and in fact adopted a position of supporting the "Security Treaty," suffered a disastrous defeat.

    The results of this election meant that the U.S.-Japan reactionaries were unable to control the necessary two-thirds of the statutory number of seats in the parliament to realize their long-planned revision of the current constitution that stipulates Japan's renunciation of war, intensify the implementation of the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and push Japan onto the dangerous road of war. However, Hayato Ikeda actually insisted on calling the majority he obtained by relying on "money and power" as the Japanese people's "support" for the Liberal Democratic Party's policy of subservience to the United States, meaning "recognition of the Security Treaty," etc. How absurd and shameless this is! The U.S. State Department also tried its best to conceal the "unease it felt" due to the significant progress made by the Japanese patriotic and democratic forces in this general election and the disastrous defeat of the Democratic Socialist Party, and cheered on the Ikeda government, saying that the results of the Japanese general election "show that most Japanese people support their government's policy of cooperation with the free world countries"; the United States "looks forward to working closely with Prime Minister Ikeda and his government in the years to come."

    However, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries should not think that they can do whatever they want with a majority of seats in parliament. Please do not forget that when the Nobusuke Kishi government was in power, the majority in parliament was also in the hands of the Liberal Democratic Party. It was precisely relying on such a majority that Nobusuke Kishi forced the parliament to illegally pass the new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty." It was also because Nobusuke Kishi implemented an extremely pro-American policy that violated the interests of the Japanese people, willingly sold out sovereignty, relied on U.S. imperialism, revived Japanese militarist forces, and implemented the U.S. war policy and aggressive policy, and followed the United States in opposing China, that it aroused great indignation among the broad masses of the Japanese people and launched a powerful struggle on an unprecedented scale against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, which finally led to Nobusuke Kishi's disgrace and forced him to step down in embarrassment. The Japanese people did not approve the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty in the past, and they will never approve it in the future. No matter who comes to power, if he insists on being an enemy of the Japanese people, and insists on pushing Japan onto the road of militarism, launching war and aggression, his end will never be better than Nobusuke Kishi's.

    At present, the Japanese reactionaries under the full support of U.S. imperialism still occupy a temporary advantage and appear to be powerful. Therefore, they can continue to do bad things, manipulate elections through the state machinery they control, and maintain a majority in parliament. They are still making wishful calculations, hoping to rely on U.S. imperialism, and even at the expense of driving the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder for U.S. imperialism, to realize their ambition of re-dominating Asia. However, this superficial strength of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries can only be a temporary factor. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, but to the people.

    In the course of the fifteen years after the war, the Japanese people, who have suffered deeply from the enslavement and control of U.S. imperialism and the policy of the Japanese reactionaries of subservience to the United States and revival of militarism, have become increasingly aware and increasingly united. In particular, for more than a year, the Japanese people have persisted in carrying out 23 unified actions against the U.S.-Japan military alliance. The strength of the Japanese people has been developed unprecedentedly, and they have achieved one victory after another. Does this not show that the truly powerful force belongs to the Japanese people? Although there are still obstacles intertwined by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries on their road to achieving independence, peace, democracy, and neutrality, the broad masses of the Japanese people have seen their own strength from the heroic struggle against the U.S.-Japan military alliance treaty, and have enhanced their courage and determination to fight. On their road forward, even if they encounter difficulties and there are ups and downs in the struggle, there are no insurmountable obstacles.

    The current world situation, that is, the East wind prevails over the West wind, and the forces of peace further surpass the forces of war, is very conducive to the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and against Japanese militarist forces. With the in-depth and widespread development of the Japanese people's patriotic and just struggle, the strength of the Japanese people will continue to turn from weak to strong. After repeated, serious, and a series of struggles, an independent, peaceful, democratic, and neutral Japan will eventually appear in the world.

### 评日本大选

    评日本大选
    11月20日举行的日本众议院选举结果已经全部揭晓。日本社会党和共产党的议席获得显著增加，自由民主党企图攫取三分之二以上议席的计划，遭到了挫败。这是日本爱国民主力量和日本人民的一个胜利，它表明日本广大人民争取独立、和平、民主和中立的坚强意志。
    这次大选，斗争的焦点是日美“安全条约”和中立问题；是要求独立、和平、民主和中立的日本人民同执行美国侵略政策、坚持日美军事同盟、加强军国主义化的美日反动派之间进行的一场严重的斗争。根据最后宣布的结果，在众议院全部四百六十七个议席中，社会党获得一百四十五席，增加了二十三席。日本首相池田勇人在选举前曾夸口要“把社会党压在一百人（众议员）以下”，可是，这个他失败了。日本共产党从原来的一席增加为三席，得票总数比前次大选增加了十四万四千多票。而从社会党分裂出去的右翼的民主社会党的议席，却从原来的四十席，猛跌到十七席。自由民主党得到的议席，也不是池田勇人所一再吹嘘的“肯定”会得到的三百二十席，而只是二百九十六席。
    只要稍稍接触一些这次大选的实际情况，就不难了解日本共产党和社会党的上述进展是在何等困难的条件下取得的。美日反动派在竞选过程中采取了各种卑鄙手段，操纵选举。一方面竭力宣传池田政府“同岸信介不同”，掩饰它的反动本质，百般笼络人心。另一方面，池田政府曾经专门召开全国警察头目会议，调动了一万八千名刑事警察和五万名便衣警察，加强对民主力量的镇压；并且唆使法西斯暴徒杀害了社会党领袖浅沼稻次郎，又颁布反动法令，剥夺人民集会、游行的权利，限制选举自由，雇用大批法西斯分子破坏进步政党的竞选活动。美日反动派特别集中力量攻击共产党，采取了最残暴无耻的手段破坏日共的竞选活动。日本垄断资本集团，为了给自由民主党争取选票，投入的竞选资金达二十亿日元以上，大大超过了以往的纪录。这种情况，甚至连日本资产阶级报纸也不能不认为是“战后规模最大的金钱和权力选举。”而美国政府也公开出面干涉日本内政。美国国务卿赫脱和驻日本大使麦克阿瑟第二先后发表谈话，表示支持自由民主党；美国参议院“国内治安小组”还在此期间提出诬蔑日本共产党和社会党的报告书，企图影响日本选举。
    十分明显，在日本垄断资本集团的严密控制下，当军队、警察、情报机关以至报纸、电台等宣传工具，统统被控制在美日反动派的手中，而美帝国主义的军队遍驻日本全国的时候，怎么可能会有什么真正的自由选举呢？人民在选举中的自由是极有限的；人民的意志是不可能通过选举充分表达出来的。
    正是本着这种正确的认识，日本爱国民主力量和日本广大人民，从来也不曾估计这次大选的结果，爱国民主力量的议席会超过反动势力的议席。人们普遍认为：只要不发生意外的情况，自由民主党将占有过半数的议席，池田政府将会再次出现。同时又指出，爱国民主力量也必然会通过这次选举，显示它在反对日美军事同盟斗争中已经加强了的力量。
    这次选举的结果，完全证明了上述观点和估计的正确。正如日本共产党主席野坂参三所说，在反对日美“安全条约”斗争中进行共同斗争的共产党和社会党取得了显著进展；与此相反，反对中立而事实上采取支持“安全条约”立场的民主社会党遭到惨败。
    这次选举的结果，使得美日反动派没有能够在议会中掌握必要的三分之二的法定议席数目，来实现他们蓄谋已久的修改规定日本弃绝战争的现行宪法，加紧推行日美军事同盟条约、把日本推上战争的危险道路。可是，池田勇人竟把它依靠“金钱和权力”取得的多数，硬说成是什么日本人民“拥护”自由民主党执行屈从美国的政策，意味着“承认了安全条约”等等，这是多么荒谬无耻！美国国务院也极力掩饰它由于日本爱国民主力量在这次大选中获得显著进展、民主社会党遭到惨败而“感到的不安”，为池田政府打气，说什么日本大选的结果“表明大多数日本人民支持他们的政府同自由世界国家合作的政策”；美国“期待同池田首相及他的政府在未来的年月紧密地合作”。
    但是，美日反动派不要以为有了议会中的多数议席，就可以为所欲为了。请他们不要忘记，岸信介政府执政的时候，议会的多数也是在自由民主党手里。正是依靠了这样一种多数，岸信介强使议会非法通过了新日美“安全条约”。也正因为岸信介执行了极端亲美的违背日本人民利益的政策，甘心出卖主权，投靠美帝国主义，复活日本军国主义势力，执行美国的战争政策和侵略政策，并且追随美国敌视中国，才激起了广大日本人民极大的义愤，展开了规模空前的反对日美军事同盟条约的强大斗争，终于使岸信介身败名裂，而不得不狼狈下台。日本人民过去没有批准日美军事同盟条约，今后也永远不会批准。不管是谁上台，如果坚持同日本人民为敌，硬要把日本推向军国主义、发动战争和侵略的道路，他的结局，也绝不会比岸信介好一些。
    目前，在美帝国主义全力扶植下的日本反动派还占有暂时的优势，貌似强大。因而他们还能继续做坏事，通过他们掌握着的国家机器，操纵选举，保持议会中的多数。他们还在打着如意算盘，指望依附美帝国主义，甚至不惜驱使日本人民为美帝国主义充当炮灰，来实现他们重新称霸亚洲的野心。然而，美日反动派这种表面上的强大，只能是临时起作用的因素。从长远的观点看，真正强大的力量不是属于美日反动派，而是属于人民的。
    在战后十五年的过程中，深受美帝国主义奴役和控制之苦、深受日本反动派屈从美国复活军国主义政策之害的日本人民，觉悟日益提高，团结日益加强。特别是一年多以来，日本人民坚持进行了二十三次反对日美军事同盟的统一行动，日本人民的力量得到了空前的发展，取得了一个接一个的胜利。这难道不表明真正强大的力量是属于日本人民的吗？虽则，在他们争取实现独立、和平、民主、中立的道路上，还横梗着美日反动派相勾结的障碍物，但是，广大日本人民已经从反对日美军事同盟条约的英勇斗争中，看到了自己的力量，增强了斗争的勇气和决心。在他们前进的道路上，纵然会遇到困难，斗争还会有起伏，却没有不可逾越的障碍。
    目前的世界形势，即东风压倒西风，和平力量进一步超过战争力量，是十分有利于日本人民反对美帝国主义、反对日本军国主义势力的斗争的。随着日本人民爱国正义斗争的深入和广泛的发展，日本人民的力量必将继续转弱为强，经过反复的、严重的、一系列的斗争，一个独立、和平、民主、中立的日本，终将出现于世界。
