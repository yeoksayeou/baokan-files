Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 11th: The Vietnam News Agency was authorized today to issue a statement saying that the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities' spreading of the lie that "North Vietnamese regular troops may have entered South Vietnam via Laos" and attacked South Vietnamese puppet army outposts in the Kontum Plateau is a complete fabrication. Its purpose is to create a pretext for the United States and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to further interfere in South Vietnam and Laos.

The statement said that recently, the South Vietnamese authorities have assembled more than 10,000 regular troops from the 22nd Division, artillery, motorized units, and air force, and coordinated with local armed forces such as "Self-Defense Forces," "Militia," and "Civilian Guard" in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in the provinces of Kontum, Pleiku, and Darlac, to carry out brutal attacks and reprisals against former resistance personnel and other patriotic people in order to accelerate the construction of this area into a huge strategic area for the American imperialists in Southeast Asia.

The statement pointed out that the American imperialists and their running dogs in South Vietnam and Southeast Asia have been trying to shamelessly slander the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to cover up their conspiracy to continuously intensify persecution and retaliatory activities and "strengthen pacification and security activities" in the Kontum Plateau.

The statement said that the purpose of the American imperialists and their running dogs in Southeast Asia's slander and fabrication against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is to create a pretext to cover up the United States' intensified military intervention in Laos, its reinforcement of the Nosavan group to help them oppose the legitimate government of the Kingdom of Laos, and its expansion of the civil war in Laos, thereby exacerbating the tension in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

The statement pointed out that the American imperialists are urging the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc to intensify its interference in Laos and Vietnam.

The statement said that despite the shameless slander and distortion of the truth by the American imperialists and their running dogs in South Vietnam and Southeast Asia, they cannot deceive public opinion and conceal their ulterior motives and activities. No matter how cunning the interventionist conspiracy of the American imperialists and the reactionary forces—members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc—may be, they cannot extinguish the increasingly vigorous movement of the people of South Vietnam and all colonies and other dependent countries around the world against oppression, for peace, and for national independence and democracy.

    越南通讯社受权发表声明
    揭露美国和越南南方当局的无耻诬蔑
    谴责美国制造借口掩盖对老挝的侵略阴谋
    新华社河内11日电　越南通讯社今天受权发表声明说，美国和越南南方当局散布所谓“越南北方正规军可能已取道老挝进入越南南方”，并袭击昆嵩高原的南方傀儡军岗哨的谎言，是彻头彻尾的捏造，其目的是为美国和东南亚条约组织进一步干涉越南南方和老挝制造借口。
    声明说，最近，越南南方当局集结了第二十二师、炮兵、摩托部队和空军等一万多名正规军，配合诸如“自卫队”、“民军”和“民卫队”等地方武装力量在昆嵩、波来古、大拉克几个省少数民族聚居之处，对当地的前抗战人员和其他爱国志士进行了残暴的袭击和报复，以便加速把这一地区建成为美帝国主义者在东南亚的巨大战略地区。
    声明指出，美帝国主义者和他们在越南南方及东南亚的走狗一直试图无耻地诬蔑越南民主共和国，以掩盖他们在昆嵩高原不断加紧进行迫害和报复活动以及“加强绥靖和治安活动”的阴谋。
    声明说，美帝国主义者及其在东南亚的走狗们对越南民主共和国的诬蔑和捏造其目的是制造借口以掩盖美国加紧对老挝进行军事干涉、增援诺萨万集团以帮助他们反对老挝王国的合法政府、扩大老挝的内战，从而加剧印度支那和东南亚的紧张局势的阴谋。
    声明指出，美帝国主义者正在促使侵略性的东南亚条约组织军事集团加紧干涉老挝和越南。
    声明说，尽管美帝国主义者和他们在越南南方及东南亚的走狗无耻地进行诬蔑和歪曲真相，他们都不能欺骗舆论和掩盖他们不可告人的目的和活动。美帝国主义和反动势力——东南亚条约组织侵略集团成员国——的干涉阴谋不论如何狡猾，都不能扑灭越南南方以及全世界各殖民地和其他附属国人民的日益蓬勃开展的反对压迫、争取和平、争取民族独立与民主的运动。
