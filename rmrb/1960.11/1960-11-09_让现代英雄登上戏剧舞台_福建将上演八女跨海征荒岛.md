Let Modern Heroes Appear on the Theatrical Stage
Fujian to Stage "Eight Women Cross the Sea to Reclaim a Barren Island"

(Our dispatch) The heroic deeds of eight women from Hui'an conquering a barren island across the sea to vigorously develop agriculture will soon be brought to the Min opera and spoken drama stages.

The Third Troupe of the Fuzhou Min Opera Theatre, based on the moving deeds reported in the Fujian Daily of eight women from Hui'an crossing ten li of sea to conquer a barren island and vigorously develop agriculture, has written a large-scale modern drama "Eight Women Cross the Sea" and is actively rehearsing it. It will soon be premiered in the suburbs of Fuzhou City. In the process of creation, the writers and directors studied the spirit of the eight women overcoming difficulties, painstakingly researched, and repeatedly revised the script. Comrades from the Provincial Drama Troupe's writing team went deep into the scene on Dazhu Island, Hui'an, to experience life. Encouraged by the heroic behavior of the eight women, they rushed to write a six-act large-scale spoken drama in just a few days. (Attached picture)
