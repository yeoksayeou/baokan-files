The Third "Exercise"
Poem by Tian Ma, Cartoon by Fang Cheng
The newspaper reports: The German militarist army, which occupied France twice in the past thirty years, entered France again on October 26th under the guise of "exercise." To prevent French residents from demonstrating against it, the French authorities blockaded this news from the people. The West German army also took off its traditional mouse-grey uniform and put on tea-brown uniforms. ... The first "exercise," I, De Gaulle, have not forgotten: The German army rampaged into Paris, so majestic and imposing, I admired it from the bottom of my heart! The second "exercise," I, De Gaulle, have not forgotten either: I admire the neighbor's good martial arts, occupying France only took two weeks! The swastika flag fluttered above the Eiffel Tower! The orderly steps passed through the Arc de Triomphe! And now it is the third "exercise"! I, De Gaulle, admire even more their
Good idea: Take off the mouse-grey skin, put on the brown clothes, and enter our country all at once. ... Good friends, good neighbors, good relatives, many visits are really too kind, congratulations on your "exercise" achieving good results! Take off your hat, salute, and say: Welcome! Oh, I can't hold it back, I still have to shout: Dear! ... De Gaulle agrees, the French people protest! Raise the brooms high, to sweep away the demons! (Attached picture)

    第三次“演习”
    天马诗　方成画
    报载：三十年内两次占领法国的德国军国主义军队，10月26日又以“演习”为名开进了法国。为了防止法国居民示威反对，法国当局对人民封锁了这条消息。西德军队也脱下传统的鼠色军装，换上茶褐色军装。……第一次“演习”，我，戴高乐没有忘记：德军横冲直撞入巴黎，好威风呀好神气，我从心底儿佩服不已！第二次“演习”，我，戴高乐更没有忘记：我钦佩邻居好武艺，侵占法国只用了两星期！卐字旗在铁塔上面飘扬整齐的步伐通过了凯旋门里！而今是第三次“演习”！我，戴高乐更佩服他们的
  好主意：脱下鼠色皮，换上褐色衣，一下就开进我们国土里。……好朋友，好邻居，好亲戚，多次登门拜访实在不过意，祝贺你们“演习”获得好成绩！脱个帽，敬个礼，说一声：欢迎你！哎呀，憋不住呀，还要叫声：亲爱的！……戴高乐同意，法国人民抗议！千万把扫帚高举起，要把妖魔扫出去！（附图片）
