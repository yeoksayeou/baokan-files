More Than a Thousand Scientific and Technical Personnel in Beijing Go Deep into Suburban Communes
Bringing Technology to the Forefront of Agriculture

    (Our Dispatch) In the upsurge of the whole Party and the entire people engaging in agriculture and large-scale grain production, more than a thousand scientific and technical personnel in the capital have gone deep into the suburban people's communes, bringing science and technology to the forefront of agricultural production, which has not only promoted agricultural production but also enriched scientific research and teaching work.

    This scientific and technical contingent, under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, is composed of agricultural scientific research units, universities and colleges, and production departments in Beijing. They go deep into the countryside, and under the leadership of the local Party committees, they eat, live, work, and consult with the commune members, conducting comprehensive and specialized agricultural technical investigations and summaries. In conjunction with current agricultural production, they mainly investigate the rules by which farmers in different regions and conditions achieve high yields of crops such as rice, corn, sweet potatoes, and cotton by applying the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," and comprehensively and systematically summarize the experiences of high yields. At the same time, they provide technical guidance and popularize advanced technologies to solve the agricultural technical problems that are urgently needed for current production, so that crops can achieve higher yields, and low yields can be transformed into high yields.

    These scientific and technical personnel are closely integrated with the masses of farmers, summarizing high-yield experiences in agricultural production from aspects such as seed selection, sowing period, cultivation methods, and field management, in order to prepare for increased production next year. The rice investigation team went to districts and counties such as Daxing, Fangshan, and Haidian to summarize the experiences of large-area high-yield and high-yield fields, transforming saline-alkali land into rice paddies, direct rice seeding, promoting rice transplanting machines, and fully utilizing the previous crop land before rice sowing. The corn and sweet potato investigation teams jointly summarized the intercropping and multiple cropping cultivation experiences of farmers in Pinggu, Shunyi, and other counties, who mastered the crop growth period and increased the multiple cropping area to increase grain production. The vegetable investigation team, which went deep into the urban suburbs, summarized a set of simple, easy-to-implement, and reliable vegetable storage methods based on the rich experience of the masses, and has begun to promote them among the masses.

    When summarizing agricultural production experience this time, the scientific and technical personnel also closely combined with the "Three Autumns" work, striving to become good advisors and capable assistants to the Party committees in leading production, and helping suburban communes solve agricultural technical problems. The staff of the mathematics group helped the people's communes in Tong County and Haidian District solve the problem of rational arrangement of "Three Autumns" labor and transportation. Yangfuzhuang Production Team of Niubao Township People's Commune used operations research to rationally arrange labor, saving 20% of labor in artificial irrigation alone, and also improving labor efficiency. It is now being promoted in the three production teams of the commune through popular explanations, so that the production team leaders and commune members can also master this calculation method, so as to use it in other farm work and better organize labor. In order to strive for more vegetable production and harvest, the vegetable disease and pest investigation team conducted investigations in more than a dozen communes, analyzed and studied the development trends and laws of disease and pest this year, and summarized and promoted the masses' experience in preventing and controlling diseases and pests. In Liangxiang Commune, Fangshan County, they also promoted an effective method of directly shooting the medicinal powder to the hillside to prevent and control pests on mountain fruit trees. In this way, commune members no longer need to carry water and climb mountains with sprayers when spraying pesticides, which saves labor and solves the difficulty of insufficient water sources in mountainous areas, which is very popular among the masses.

    In the work of investigation and summary, scientific research and teaching personnel have learned a lot of practical knowledge from the farmers, which has also enriched agricultural scientific research work and improved the quality of teaching. Many scientific research personnel and teachers have expanded the scope of scientific research through practice, and discovered some research problems that are closely related to production but have not been valued, which has greatly promoted the progress of scientific research. For example, in the past, when the agronomy departments of relevant universities in Beijing studied the experience of high rice yields in school experimental fields, they only obtained the experience of good tillering when the rice panicles were neat. This time, when summarizing the experience of farmers in planting rice, they discovered the valuable experience of strong but not steeply growing rice seedlings in the early stage and full panicles in the later stage. This made their high-yield experience in school experimental research complete. In the past, there were only two ways to prevent and control the solitary disease, one of the three major diseases of cabbage: one is to remove insects, and the other is to remove weeds. This time, when conducting investigations in Nanyuan and Xiaotangshan People's Commune, it was found that farmers used cultivation methods to prevent and control solitary disease with good results. Some teachers and researchers were greatly inspired and believed that this is a new direction in the prevention and control of viral diseases, and it is a new topic that needs to be studied urgently.

    北京一千多名科学技术人员深入郊区公社
    把技术送上农业第一线
    本报讯　首都一千多名科学技术人员在全党全民大办农业、大办粮食运动中，深入郊区人民公社，把科学技术送到农业生产第一线，既促进了农业生产，又丰富了科学研究和教学工作。
    这支科学技术队伍，是在中共北京市委的领导下，由北京市的农业科学研究单位、大专院校和生产部门组成的。他们深入农村，在当地党委领导下，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动、同商量，进行综合性和专题性的农业技术考察和总结。结合当前的农业生产，他们主要考察农民在不同地区和条件对水稻、玉米、甘薯、棉花等作物运用农业“八字宪法”取得高产的规律，全面系统地总结丰产经验。同时对当前生产急需解决的农业技术问题，进行技术指导和普及推广先进技术，使农作物高产更高产，低产变高产。
    这些科学技术人员和农民群众密切地相结合，从选种、播种期、栽培方法和田间管理等方面总结农业生产的高产经验，为明年增产作好准备。水稻考察组到大兴、房山、海淀等区、县分别总结了大面积丰产和高额丰产田、盐碱地改水稻田、水稻直播、推广水稻插秧机，以及水稻播种前充分利用前茬土地等经验。玉米、甘薯考察组共同总结了平谷、顺义等县农民掌握作物生育期，提高复种面积以增产粮食的间作、套作的栽培经验。深入到城郊区的蔬菜考察组，根据群众的丰富经验，结合科学研究总结出一套简单、易行、可靠的贮菜方法，已经开始在群众中推广。
    科学技术人员在这次总结农业生产经验时，还紧密结合“三秋”工作，力争成为党委领导生产的好参谋和得力助手，帮助郊区公社解决农业技术问题。数学小组的工作人员帮助通县和海淀区的人民公社解决“三秋”劳动力和运输力的合理安排问题。牛堡屯人民公社杨富庄生产队运用运筹学合理安排了劳动力，仅一项人工灌水田就节省劳力20％，又提高了劳动效率。现正通过通俗讲解，在公社的三个生产队里推广，使生产队长和社员也掌握这种计算方法，以便在其他农活中运用，更好地组织劳力。为争取蔬菜多产多收，蔬菜病虫害考察小组到十多个公社进行调查，分析研究了今年病虫害发展的趋势和规律，并总结和推广了群众防治病虫害的经验。他们在房山县良乡公社还推广了一种把药粉直接射到山腰，防治山上果树虫害的有效方法。这样社员打药时，再不用挑水和背着喷雾器爬山，既节省了劳力，又解决了山区水源不足的困难，很受群众欢迎。
    科学研究和教学人员在考察总结工作中，向农民学习了很多实践知识，也丰富了农业科学研究工作，提高了教学质量。许多科学研究人员和教师通过实践扩大了科学研究的范围，发现一些和生产紧密相关而未被重视的研究问题，大大促进了科学研究的进展。如北京有关高等学校农学系过去在学校试验场研究水稻丰产经验时，仅取得稻子穗齐过好拔节关的经验，这次在总结农民种植水稻的经验时，发现了稻苗早期壮而不陡长和后期穗粒饱满的可贵经验。这样就使他们在学校试验研究的丰产经验完整了。过去防治白菜三大病害之一的孤丁病办法只有两条，一是除虫，二是除草。这次在南苑、小汤山人民公社进行考察时，发现农民用栽培方法防治孤丁病效果很好，一些教师和研究人员受到很大启发，认为这是病毒病害防治的新方向，是急需进行研究的新题目。
