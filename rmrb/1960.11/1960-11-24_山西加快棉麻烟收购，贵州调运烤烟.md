    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 23rd: Since late October, Shanxi Province has been steadily accelerating the procurement of cotton, hemp, and tobacco. Currently, large quantities of processed new cotton are being successively transferred to spinning factories in Taiyuan, Yuci, Datong, and Beijing. The procurement of hemp bark and tobacco leaves has also reached a high tide in key producing areas. In the Jin Southeast region, which accounts for half of the province's hemp bark procurement task, a team of more than 40,000 people is working day and night to peel new hemp. In Linfen County, a tobacco-producing area, more than 70% of the total tobacco yield has been cured and is being continuously transported to cities to support the cigarette industry's production.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 23rd: Commercial and transportation departments in Guizhou Province are closely cooperating to strengthen the transportation of flue-cured tobacco in order to support the cigarette industry's production.
    After the procurement of flue-cured tobacco began throughout the province, the Provincial Department of Commerce established a flue-cured tobacco transportation office to uniformly arrange transportation capacity and ensure timely transport. Commercial departments fixed vehicles and adopted the method of setting time and tasks to specifically transport flue-cured tobacco. Commercial departments also collaborated with transportation departments to vigorously promote piggyback transportation to ensure that vehicles are not empty. In the first half of November alone, they transported 428 tons of tobacco leaves, equivalent to the freight volume of ninety 4.5-ton trucks. At the same time, various localities also utilized the mass transportation force to transport tobacco leaves from production areas to transportation lines.
    The Provincial Department of Commerce, in conjunction with the industrial departments, formed five working groups to assist in centralized packing and to promote piggyback transportation in various localities, which also promoted the transportation of tobacco leaves.

    山西加快棉麻烟收购，贵州调运烤烟
    新华社太原23日电　山西省棉、麻、烟的收购工作，10月下旬以来进度步步加快。目前加工好的大量新棉正陆续调往太原、榆次、大同和北京等地纺纱工厂。麻皮、烟叶的收购工作，在重点产区也已经形成高潮。占全省麻皮收购任务一半的晋东南地区，组成四万多人的剥麻队伍，正在日夜赶剥新麻。烟叶产区的临汾县，已经烤出的烟叶占总产量70％以上，正源源运往城市支援卷烟工业生产。
    新华社贵阳23日电　贵州省商业、交通部门密切协作，加强烤烟调运工作，支援卷烟工业生产。
    收购烤烟工作在全省普遍展开以后，省商业厅即成立了烤烟调运办公室，统一安排运输力量，及时调运。商业部门固定汽车，采取定时间、定任务的办法，专门运输烤烟。商业部门还同交通运输部门挂钩协作，大搞捎脚运输，做到车不空驶，仅11月上半月就捎运烟叶四百二十八吨，相当于九十部四吨半载重汽车的运货量。同时，各地还运用群众运输力量，把烟叶从产区运到交通沿线。
    省商业厅会同工业部门组成五个工作组，到各地帮助集中打包和开展捎脚运输，也促进了烟叶调运工作。
