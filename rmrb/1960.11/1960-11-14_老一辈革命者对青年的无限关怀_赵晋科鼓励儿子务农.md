    The older generation of revolutionaries shows boundless care for young people.
  　Zhao Jinke encourages his son to farm.
    (Our report) Zhao Jinke, Deputy Director of the Administrative Office of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee and a Communist Party member, has been actively encouraging his son to participate in agricultural production, earning praise from the masses.
    In the summer of 1957, the Party called on middle and primary school graduates to go to the mountains and countryside to build a new socialist countryside. At that time, Zhao Jinke's second son, Zhao Yun, had just graduated from Tianjin No. 13 Middle School. He wanted to respond to the Party's call and go to the countryside, but he was hesitant and prepared to go home and discuss it with his father. Zhao Yun walked home, recalling what his father had said to him. When they first came to Tianjin, he had asked his father, "Will we always be here?" His father said, "It depends on the needs of the revolution." Would his father still say that today? On their first night in Tianjin, his father had also told him, "From now on, you will be called Zhao Yun, your older brother will be called Zhao Geng, and your younger brother will be called Zhao Tian. Don't call yourselves Guijin and Guiyin anymore. Don't forget that you are the children of the working people, and you must not forget labor!" Wouldn't failing to resolutely go to the countryside be forgetting labor?
    That day, Zhao Jinke had just finished attending an enlarged meeting of the Municipal People's Committee, where the "Plan for Arranging the Enrollment and Employment of Middle and Primary School Graduates" was adopted. As soon as he heard Zhao Yun mention going to the countryside, he immediately expressed his approval and encouraged Zhao Yun: You've chosen the right path! This is how a Communist Party member should behave. Before leaving, the father and son had a long conversation, jointly recalling the past suffering they had endured.
    Zhao Yun came to the Communism Road Agricultural Cooperative (now Junliangcheng Management District of Xinli Village Commune, Hedong District, Tianjin Municipality), and became an ordinary member. In more than a month, he rarely wrote to his father, and even when he did, he wrote very simply. Zhao Jinke was worried. One Sunday, Zhao Jinke and his wife took Zhao Tian to see Zhao Yun. Zhao Yun greeted them happily. His father asked him with a smile: How is it going? Zhao Yun immediately led his father on a tour of his cooperative. They stood on the iron bridge at the entrance to the village, looking at the dense willow trees on both banks. Zhao Yun pointed to the four red-brick, blue-tiled houses deep in the willow forest and said, "This is our hydroelectric power station." Then, pointing to the boundless green rice fields, he said, "This is our crops." Zhao Jinke happily said to his son: "Now you should know, the countryside is indeed a vast world, and there is endless knowledge to be learned here. Work hard and use your own hands to build a better countryside!" That day, Zhao Jinke specifically visited the local Party branch secretary and village chief, repeatedly stating that he was entrusting his child to the village and asking the branch secretary and village chief to strictly demand him. He said that young people should endure some hardship and get some training.
    After some time, Zhao Jinke learned from his son's letter that he had been assigned to the pig farm, and it seemed that the working conditions were not very good. From the letter, he could not see his son's ideological situation. He was worried that his son was not working well, so he took time out to find Zhao Yun again. His son received him in the only small earthen house at the pig farm. This small house was filled with various pig-raising tools and pig feed, and his son's bed only occupied one corner of the room. When Zhao Yun saw his father, he seemed a little embarrassed. When Zhao Jinke saw this situation, he immediately pointed to the house happily and said: Yun, you are doing the right thing, your future is here.
    After seeing his father off, Zhao Yun worked even more actively. During the coldest days of winter, he was afraid that the piglets would freeze, so he put them under his own mattress at night and covered them with his own cotton-padded coat. Several pigs developed rectal prolapse, and Zhao Yun manually massaged them back in, little by little. During the dog days of summer when it rained heavily, he led several people to scoop water out of the pig pens day and night, fearing that the pigs would be flooded. Whenever he had a little free time, he asked people everywhere for advice on pig-raising techniques, learned how to treat pigs, and became a "pig doctor." Under the education and cultivation of the Party organization and encouraged by his father, Zhao Yun's ideology, labor, and learning became increasingly outstanding. He was elected as an activist in socialist construction in the city and district, and also as a representative of the Hedong District People's Congress. (Attached picture)

    老一辈革命者对青年的无限关怀
  　赵晋科鼓励儿子务农
    本报讯　天津市人民委员会行政处副处长、共产党员赵晋科，积极鼓励儿子参加农业生产，受到群众赞扬。
    1957年夏天，党号召中、小学毕业生上山下乡，建设新农村。当时，赵晋科的二儿子赵耘，正好在天津第十三中学毕业，想要响应党的号召到农村去，但又拿不定主意，准备回家和父亲商量。赵耘一边往家走，一边回忆父亲对自己说过的话。那是刚来天津的时候，自己曾问过父亲：“我们总在这里吗？”父亲说：“看革命需要。”如今，父亲会不会还说这句话呢？来天津的第一个晚上，父亲还曾告诉自己：“从现在起，你改名叫赵耘，哥哥叫赵耕，弟弟叫赵田，不要再叫什么贵金、贵银了。别忘了，你们是劳动人民的孩子，可不能忘了劳动啊！”不能坚决去农村是不是忘了劳动呢？
    那天，赵晋科正好刚开完市人委扩大会议，会上通过了“关于安排中、小学毕业生升学就业的方案”，一听赵耘提到去农村，立刻表示赞成，而且鼓励赵耘：你选的路子对！这才是一个共产党员应有的行为。临走以前，父子俩做了一次长时间的谈话，共同回忆了过去的苦难经历。
    赵耘来到原宁河县共产主义之路农业社（现天津市河东区新立村公社军粮城管理区），成了一个普通社员。一个多月里，他给父亲很少写信，就是写信的时候，也写得很简单。赵晋科不太放心。一个星期天，赵晋科夫妇领着赵田来看赵耘。赵耘高兴地迎上去。父亲笑着问他：干得怎么样？赵耘立刻领着父亲参观了自己的合作社。他们站在村头铁桥上，望着两岸密茂的垂柳，赵耘指柳林深处四座红砖蓝瓦的房子说，这是我们的水电站。又指着那无边碧绿的稻海说：“这是我们的庄稼。”赵晋科高兴地对儿子说：“现在你该知道了吧，农村确是个广阔的天地，这里有学不尽的学问。好好干，用自己的双手把农村建设得更美好！”那天，赵晋科特意拜访了当地的党支部书记和村长，再三表示把自己的孩子交给村里了，要支部书记和村长严格要求他。他说，年青人应该吃点苦，锻炼锻炼。
    过了些日子，赵晋科从儿子的来信中，知道他被派到猪场去养猪了，好像工作条件不太好。从信上看不出儿子的思想情况。他担心儿子工作不好，就又抽空来找赵耘。儿子在猪场唯一的一间小土房里接待了他。这间小屋堆满了各种养猪用具和猪饲料，儿子的床只占了屋子的一角。赵耘一见父亲，好像有点不好意思。赵晋科见到这情形，立即高兴地指着这屋子说：耘，你做得对，你的前途正在这里。
  送父亲走后，赵耘工作更积极了。三九天怕小猪冻着，夜里把小猪放在自己的褥子底下，把自己的棉袄也给小猪盖上。有几个猪得了脱肛病，赵耘就用手一点点地揉回去。三伏天下大雨，怕猪淹着，他带领几个人不分昼夜地从圈里往外掏水。每逢有一点空，他就到处向人请教养猪技术，学会了给猪治病，成了“猪大夫”。赵耘在党组织的教育和培养下，在他父亲的鼓励下，思想劳动和学习越来越出色，当选了市、区的社会主义建设积极分子，还当选了河东区人民代表。（附图片）
