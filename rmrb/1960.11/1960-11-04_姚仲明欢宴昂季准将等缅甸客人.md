Brigadier General Aung Gyi, on behalf of all members of the Burmese delegation to the Sino-Burmese Boundary Joint Committee, expressed his gratitude to Chief Representative Yao Zhongming for hosting the banquet. He said that Mr. Yao Zhongming and I have been very friendly in our past work. According to my understanding, during the demarcation work between our two countries, the survey personnel of the two countries were equally friendly, and therefore the previous stage of survey work achieved such great success.
