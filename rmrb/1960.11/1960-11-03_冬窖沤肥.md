    Winter Cellar Composting
    Our Chigang Commune in Nanchang County is digging winter cellars on a large scale to compost fertilizer as part of the manure accumulation campaign. The winter cellar composting method is the same as summer green manure pressing: a large pit is dug and mountain green, roadside grass, leaves, dirty soil, and manure are mixed together to compost. After a winter of fermentation, it is removed in the spring and becomes high-quality fertilizer. Applying this fertilizer to paddy fields promotes rapid seedling growth and greening, and also improves the soil. Because there are many sources of fertilizer and the method of making fertilizer is simple, it is a good way to accumulate fertilizer in winter. Currently, our commune has dug nearly three thousand winter cellars and composted more than 400,000 dan of fertilizer.

    冬窖沤肥
    我们南昌县茌港公社在积肥运动中大挖冬窖沤肥。冬窖沤肥和夏季压绿肥的办法一样，就是挖一个大坑把山青、路草、树叶和脏土粪尿等混在一起沤制，经过一个冬季的发酵，第二年春天起出，就成为优质肥料。这种肥料施在稻田里，催苗返青快，还能改良土壤。由于肥源多，制肥办法简单，因此是冬季积肥的一项好办法。现在我们公社已挖冬窖近三千个，沤制了肥料四十多万担。
