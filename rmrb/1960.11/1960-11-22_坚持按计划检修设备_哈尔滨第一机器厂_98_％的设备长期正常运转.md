    Adhering to Planned Equipment Maintenance
    Harbin No. 1 Machine Tool Plant Achieves 98% Long-Term Normal Operation of Equipment
    (Our report) The Harbin No. 1 Machine Building Plant, through strengthening political and ideological work, proactively and systematically conducting preventative maintenance, and vigorously promoting spare parts production, has ensured that over 98% of its machinery and equipment operate normally for extended periods. From January to October of this year, the plant has consistently exceeded its state-assigned quotas each month.
    Since the beginning of this year, the plant's Party committee has mobilized its workers to conduct extensive discussions and debates on the issue of strengthening equipment maintenance. On the basis of raising ideological awareness, the plant has implemented a system of planned preventative equipment maintenance. While formulating quarterly, monthly, and ten-day production plans, the plant also formulates equipment preventative maintenance plans based on the operating patterns and wear conditions of the machinery. They have adopted methods of assigning personnel, defining projects, setting timelines, and ensuring quality to implement the maintenance plans item by item. Machine repair workers, in accordance with the maintenance plans, implement a system of linked responsibilities, assigned sections, and individual accountability to do a good job in equipment maintenance. Each workshop also organized production workers to establish equipment files, in which workers record in detail problems encountered during operation and maintenance, accumulating necessary reference materials for formulating preventative maintenance plans and guiding maintenance work. To ensure the implementation of the preventative maintenance plans, the plant, with the machine repair workshop as the backbone, vigorously carried out the production of equipment spare parts, establishing three levels of spare parts warehouses at the plant, workshop, and group levels. In terms of spare parts production, they adopted a two-pronged approach, that is, critical spare parts are the responsibility of the machine repair workshop for production and supply, while general consumable spare parts are self-made, self-stored, and self-used by the maintenance teams of each workshop according to spare parts quotas. Large-scale precision spare parts that cannot be manufactured by the plant are resolved through inter-factory cooperation.

    坚持按计划检修设备
    哈尔滨第一机器厂98％的设备长期正常运转
    本报讯　哈尔滨第一机器制造厂用加强政治思想工作，主动地、有计划地进行预防性检修，同时大抓备件生产等办法，使98％以上的机器设备长期保持正常运转。今年1月到10月份，月月超额完成国家计划。
    今年以来，这个厂党委发动广大职工针对加强设备维护保养问题开展了大鸣、大放、大辩论。在提高思想认识的基础上，全厂推行了设备计划预修制度。他们在编制季度和月、旬生产计划的同时，根据机器的运转规律和磨损情况，编制出设备预修计划，并采取定人员、定项目、定时间和定质量的方法，把检修计划逐项落实。机修工人们根据检修计划，实行挂钩对口、分片包干、各负专责地做好设备检修工作。各车间还组织生产工人建立了设备档案，由工人详细记载运转过程中出现的问题以及维护保养情况，为编制预修计划和指导维修工作积累必要的参考资料。为了保证预修计划的实现，这个厂以机修车间为骨干，大搞设备备件生产，建立了厂部、车间和小组的三级备件库。在备件生产方面，他们采取了两条腿走路的方针，即关键性的备件由机修车间负责生产和供应，一般性的易耗备件则由各车间的维修小组根据备件定额进行自制、自储、自用。本厂不能制造的大型精密备件，就采取厂际协作的办法来解决。
