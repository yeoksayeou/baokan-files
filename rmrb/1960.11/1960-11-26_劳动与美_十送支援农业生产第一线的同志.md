Title: Labor and Beauty – Seeing Off Comrades Supporting Agricultural Production Frontlines

Labor beautifies the world, and labor beautifies people. It beautifies people's souls and beautifies people's physique.

Barren hills transform into lush green mountains, and desolate wastelands become fertile fields crisscrossed with paths. "Mist and rain blur the vastness, turtles and snakes lock the great river" becomes "a bridge flies across, turning the natural chasm into a thoroughfare." This beauty of lush green mountains, the beauty of fertile fields, the beauty of a bridge spanning north and south, which of these is not the result of labor? Which of these can exist without the social practice of labor?

Comrades participating in the agricultural production frontlines are fortunate to have the opportunity, environment, and conditions to directly participate in beautifying the world and beautifying the countryside.

In Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," he mentioned: "I was a student, and I had developed student habits in school. When I was asked to do some manual labor in front of a large group of students who couldn't lift a shoulder pole or carry anything, such as carrying my own luggage, I felt it was unseemly. At that time, I felt that only intellectuals were clean, while workers and peasants were always relatively dirty… After the revolution, I was with workers, peasants, and revolutionary soldiers, and I gradually became familiar with them, and they gradually became familiar with me. Only then, only at this time, did I fundamentally change the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois feelings that bourgeois schools had taught me. At this time, when comparing the untransformed intellectuals with the workers and peasants, I felt that the intellectuals were unclean, and the cleanest were the workers and peasants, even though their hands were black and their feet had cow dung, they were still cleaner than the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals."

My understanding of Chairman Mao's words is that they have at least two layers. The first layer is that the thoughts and feelings of workers and peasants are clean and beautiful; the thoughts and feelings of the untransformed bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals are dirty and ugly. The second layer is that untransformed intellectuals are willing to discard the old and embrace the new: to discard the old bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings, and to embrace the new thoughts and feelings of the workers and peasants; to discard the dirty and ugly, and to embrace the clean and beautiful. This can only be achieved through labor, through living together with the working people, to gradually complete the transformation.

The idea that labor is glorious and that labor is the primary need of life is one of the basic contents of socialist and communist thought. This idea certainly needs to be understood from books and from reason. Without revolutionary theory, there would be no revolutionary movement. We have always valued the significance of reason and theory. This was the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will not change in the future. However, to imbue these abstract ideas with genuine emotions; to transform these principles into one's own flesh and blood, it is only possible through labor, through living together with the working people.

Comrades participating in the agricultural production frontlines are fortunate to have the opportunity, environment, and conditions not only to beautify the objective world, but also to beautify the subjective world.

As the saying goes, "Skillful hands come from a clever mind," the mind and skillful hands are always connected. Skillful hands are the foundation of the mind, and the mind in turn guides skillful hands. "Only when hands teach the brain, and then the more intelligent brain teaches the hands, and the clever hands again more powerfully promote the development of the brain, can the process of human social and cultural development develop normally." (Gorky: "Soviet Literature")

You see, Gorky views the problem from such a high perspective: the combined use of hands (physical labor) and brain (mental labor), and with the use of hands as the foundation, is related to the normal development of human society and culture!

Comrades participating in the agricultural production frontlines are fortunate to have the opportunity, environment, and conditions for the combined use of hands and brain, and with the use of hands as the foundation. The beauty of skillful hands and a clever mind is calling and beckoning to the comrades!

Participating in physical labor accelerates the body's blood circulation and metabolism, which greatly helps a person's limbs become flexible and muscles develop; it greatly helps a person grow strong, full, and healthy.

Of course, whether it is the beauty of the mind or the beauty of the physique, aesthetic concepts also have a class nature. Is the labor concept beautiful, or is the exploitation concept beautiful? Is selflessness beautiful, or is selfishness and harming others to benefit oneself beautiful? In the eyes of the working class and the working people, the labor concept is beautiful, and selflessness is beautiful, while the opposite is ugly; are large hands and feet beautiful, or are pointed fingers beautiful? Is ruddy and dark skin beautiful, or is the pale complexion of a bean sprout that never sees the sun beautiful? In the eyes of the working class and the working people, large hands and feet are beautiful, ruddy and dark skin is beautiful, and a strong, full, and healthy body is beautiful. Chernyshevsky said it well: "The result of a prosperous life of diligent labor, but not to the point of exhaustion, gives young farmers or farm girls a very fresh and ruddy complexion—this, according to the understanding of ordinary people, is the first condition of beauty."

The *People's Daily* published a painting on page 8 on November 12, titled "Young People, Go to the Agricultural Production Frontlines!" That young woman, who looks so strong, healthy, full, and optimistic, even a little bold and rugged, is indeed a beautiful image of the new era!

Some of the comrades have already gone to the countryside, some are about to go; some have already lived with the working people, some are about to live with them; some have already participated in physical labor, some are about to participate. This creates the possibility of making oneself a person who is healthy in both body and mind, of making oneself a truly beautiful person. This beautiful person is female and male; young and old.

I would like to extend my congratulations to the comrades participating in the agricultural production frontlines from afar!

### 劳动与美——十送支援农业生产第一线的同志

    劳动与美
    ——十送支援农业生产第一线的同志
    戈松
    劳动美化了世界，劳动也美化了人。美化了人的灵魂，美化了人的体态。
    童山秃秃变成绿树成荫，一片荒原变成良田阡陌，“烟雨莽苍苍，龟蛇锁大江”变成“一桥飞架，南北天堑变通途。”这绿树成荫的美，良田阡陌的美，一桥飞架南北的美，哪一样不是劳动的成果？哪一样能够离开社会的劳动实践？
    参加农业生产第一线的同志们，恰好获得了直接参加美化世界、美化农村的机会、环境和条件。
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》一文中提到：“我是个学生出身的人，在学校养成了一种学生习惯，在一大群肩不能挑手不能提的学生面前做一点劳动的事，比如自己挑行李吧，也觉得不像样子。那时，我觉得世界上干净的人只有知识分子，工人农民总是比较脏的。……革命了，同工人农民和革命军的战士在一起了，我逐渐熟悉他们，他们也逐渐熟悉了我。这时，只是在这时，我才根本地改变了资产阶级学校所教给我的那种资产阶级的和小资产阶级的感情。这时，拿未曾改造的知识分子和工人农民比较，就觉得知识分子不干净了，最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎，还是比资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子都干净。”
    毛主席这段话的意思，据我的体会，至少有两层。第一层，工人农民的思想感情，是干净的、美的；未曾改造的资产阶级、小资产阶级的知识分子，思想感情是脏的、丑的；第二层，未曾改造的知识分子愿意去旧迎新：去掉资产阶级、小资产阶级思想感情之旧，迎接工人农民劳动人民思想感情之新；去掉脏的、丑的，迎接干净的、美的，只有通过劳动，通过同劳动人民共同生活在一起才会实现，才能逐步完成脱胎换骨的改造。
    劳动光荣的思想，劳动是生活第一需要的思想，是社会主义、共产主义思想的基本内容之一。这思想，固然需要从书本上、从理性上去认识。没有革命的理论，就没有革命的运动，我们从来就重视理性的、理论的意义的。过去是这样，现在是这样，将来也不会有什么改变。但是，要对这些抽象的思想，赋予真情实感；要把这些原理原则变为自己的血肉，同样只有通过劳动，通过与劳动人民生活在一起，才有可能。
    参加农业生产第一线的同志们，恰好获得不仅是美化客观世界，而且是美化主观世界的机会、环境和条件。
    俗话说：“心灵手巧”，心灵与手巧总是联系在一起的。手巧是心灵的基础，心灵又翻转来指导手巧。“只有在两手教导头脑，随后聪明一些的头脑教导两手，以及聪明的两手再度更有力地促进头脑发展的时候，人类的社会文化的发展过程才能正常地发展起来。”（高尔基：《苏联的文学》）
    你看，高尔基是从这样的高度来看问题的：手（体力劳动）脑（脑力劳动）并用，并且以用手为基础，是关系到人类社会文化的正常发展呵！
    参加农业生产第一线的同志们，恰好获得了手脑并用，并以用手为基础的机会、环境和条件，心灵手巧之美，在向同志们呼喊和招手！
    参加体力劳动了，加速了身体的血液循环与新陈代谢，这就大大有助于一个人的四肢灵活，肌肉发达；大大有助于一个人长得结实、丰满、健康。
    当然，无论是心灵的美，无论是体态的美，审美观念也是有阶级性的。是劳动观念美呢？还是剥削观念美呢？是大公无私美呢？还是损人利己、自私自利美呢？在工人阶级、劳动人民看来，劳动观念是美的，大公无私是美的，反之是丑的；是大手大脚美呢？还是十指尖尖美呢？是又红又黑美呢？还是不见太阳的绿豆芽美呢？在工人阶级、劳动人民看来，大手大脚是美的，又红又黑是美的，结实，丰满、健康的身体是美的。车尔尼雪夫斯基说得好：“辛勤劳动，却又不致令人精疲力竭的那样一种富足生活的结果，使青年农民或农家少女都有非常鲜嫩红润的面色——这照普通人民的理解，就是美的第一个条件。”
    《人民日报》11月12日第八版发表了一幅画，题为《青年们，到农业生产第一线去！》那个女青年，长得那么结实、健康、丰满、乐观，简直有点儿泼辣、粗犷的味道，这确是新时代的美的形象！
    同志们有的已经、有的将要到农村中去了；有的已经、有的将要同劳动人民生活在一起了；有的已经、有的将要参加体力劳动了。这就具备了这样的可能：使自己成为身心都很健康的人，使自己成为真正的美人。这美人，是女的，也是男的；是年轻的，也是年老的。
    愿向参加农业生产第一线的同志们，遥致祝贺！
