Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Nanjing: Jiangsu and Shaanxi Provinces Properly Organize All Forces to Quickly Purchase Cotton, Quickly Gin Cotton, Quickly Delint Cotton, and Quickly Transport Cotton

Jiangsu Province's cotton-producing areas are advancing simultaneously with ginning and delinting, water transport, and land transport, enabling ginning progress to steadily increase and new cotton to be continuously transported to cotton mills. In addition to transferring a batch of new cotton to textile factories within the province, they have also supported textile factories in Shanghai, Heilongjiang, and other places.

In order to ensure that cotton processing keeps up with the progress of purchasing work, cotton processing plants throughout the province have launched a large-scale cooperation movement since October, sharing information on the availability of spare parts and repairing a batch of processing machinery in a timely manner to put them into production. The Xiaoying and Suqian old factories in Huaiyin Prefecture organized technical forces to conduct on-site inspections and assistance to eleven ginning factories in Lianshui, Huaian, and other places with relatively weak technology, enabling these eleven factories to quickly put into production. Various localities have also paid attention to the full utilization of folk processing tools. In Nantong Prefecture, a major cotton-producing area in Jiangsu, six counties, in close cooperation with commercial departments and people's communes, established 59 commune-run small-scale ginning factories and concentrated more than 1,100 folk ginning machines for cotton ginning. In Rudong County, 37 communes implemented both indigenous and modern tools, concentrating dispersed ginning machines in the communes, entrusting them to the supply and marketing cooperatives for management, and agreeing on a time to gin the cotton all at once. Haian County established indigenous ginning factories in cotton-growing areas far from power-driven ginning factories, repairing and assembling existing indigenous ginning machines, and 56 units have now been put into production. More than 70 power-driven ginning factories across the province have also launched an inter-factory competition of "high quality, high yield, and safety." Leading cadres in Qidong, Haimen, and other counties went deep into the ginning factories, mobilized the masses to carry out labor competitions between factories, groups, and individuals, and each factory checked the production progress on a daily, shift, and machine basis, causing the daily processing volume of cotton to continuously increase.

Since Jiangsu Province began harvesting new cotton in September, various localities, while grasping ginning, have also made preparations for delinting, accelerating the repair and matching of damaged and incomplete delinting machines on the one hand, and quickly transferring new delinting machines to key factories for installation on the other. Now, more than 90% of the delinting machines in the province have started delinting. In the past half month, more than 12,300 dan of short绒 (short lint) have been produced, achieving simultaneous progress in ginning and delinting.

In order to supply cotton mills with raw cotton in a timely manner, commercial and transportation departments in various localities collaborated to quickly concentrate new cotton to highways, railways, inland rivers, and along the Yangtze River, unified dispatch by the transportation command, combined short-distance cotton delivery with long-distance transportation, and water transport with land transport, rushing to transport day and night. Communes and brigades have organized transportation professional groups to concentrate new cotton to ports and wharves for timely transportation, and made full use of return vehicles and ships for transportation.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Xi'an: Shaanxi Province, in response to the characteristics of this autumn's frequent rain and late cotton maturity, has adopted the method of picking, drying, purchasing, processing, and transporting cotton as it comes, accelerating the cotton purchasing work to meet the needs of textile production.

In order to accelerate seed cotton processing work, with the strong support of textile system employees, the province has newly built 40 ginning factories, increasing the total number of ginning factories to 75, and the number of ginning machines has increased from 65 to 160. Old factories have also increased power equipment and carried out technical innovations to improve processing capacity. According to the current production situation, all the cotton produced in the province this year will be processed in these ginning factories, and it will be ginned by the end of February next year, three months earlier than last year, and more than 1.5 million workdays can also be saved. According to the characteristics of this year's centralized cotton processing, Weinan County has rationally arranged cotton purchasing and processing points, adopting the method of "factory and station integration." The county's 26 processing factories both process seed cotton and purchase cotton, and the production team delivers the cotton to the ginning factory at one time. In addition to organizing carts into 203 professional transportation teams, Lintong County organized 1,720 shock cotton transport groups composed of handcarts, bicycles, and wheelbarrows, not only delivering all the purchased seed cotton to the processing plant, but also transporting all 160,000 jin of ginned lint cotton to the textile factory.

In the context of tight agricultural labor during the Three Autumn Harvests, industry, agriculture, commerce, and education are closely integrated, supporting each other and carrying out large-scale cooperation. In mid-September, textile enterprises throughout the province transferred a large number of cadres and technicians to communes and production teams in twelve major cotton-producing counties and cities to repair cotton processing machinery, help pick cotton, sell cotton, and process cotton. Shaanxi Cotton No. 1 Factory organized vehicles within the factory and helped Sanyuan County transport more than 350 dan of cotton in a week.

Xinhua News Agency Dispatch, Zhengzhou: The early tobacco of Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province has been harvested, and the late tobacco is being harvested one after another. Now, a climax of harvesting, processing, purchasing, and transporting as it comes is taking shape throughout the region.

In order to ensure that the mature tobacco leaves can be harvested more and more carefully, the Xuchang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of cadres at the county, commune, and brigade levels in early August, requiring timely harvesting and baking, improving quality, not losing a single leaf, and baking as soon as it matures, and selling as it is baked. Throughout the region, tens of thousands of technicians such as graders and inspectors have been trained through various forms. The Party committees of various counties and cities also led the masses to carry out re-harvesting activities. The Xuchang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized students and auxiliary labor to recover more than 4.37 million jin of tobacco heads and branches in two days of concentrated effort.

Improving the quality of flue-cured tobacco and accelerating the progress of flue-cured tobacco is a central link that the Party committees at all levels in the Xuchang area are grasping firmly. More than 90,000 flue-cured tobacco technicians have been trained throughout the region, and more than 7,800 kilns have been opened. The Party committee secretaries at all levels in Changge County personally took the lead in carrying out experimental kilns, and a total of more than 1,000 experimental kilns were carried out throughout the county, and the "in-kiln re-moistening method" was created to replace out-of-kiln re-moistening, which was promoted throughout the county, reducing the broken tobacco rate by 80%. Xiangcheng County extensively carried out a competition between opponents to bake more tobacco and bake good tobacco. As a result, the county's daily baking of tobacco increased sharply from more than 120,000 jin to 1.12 million jin. The region also universally promoted the advanced experience of "stacking and yellowing," placing the newly picked tobacco leaves in a room with a certain temperature to make them turn yellow first, and then loading them into the kiln. This can greatly shorten the time in the kiln, eliminate green tobacco, improve the grade, and also save one-third of the coal.

According to the different characteristics of concentrated tobacco-producing areas, general tobacco-producing areas, and scattered tobacco-producing areas, commercial departments at all levels in Xuchang Prefecture transferred more than 5,700 cadres, went deep into the production teams, established more than 2,500 purchasing outlets, and worked to process, purchase, pack, and transport as it comes.

    农产品收购贵在一气呵成
    江苏陕西妥善组织各方力量快购棉快轧花快剥绒快运棉
    许昌专区抓紧烟叶收获季节随采摘随加工随收购随调运
    据新华社南京电　江苏省各产棉区轧花与剥绒，水运与陆运齐头并进，使轧花进度节节上升，新棉源源运往纱厂。现在除调运一批新棉给省内各纺织厂以外，还支援了上海、黑龙江等地的纺织厂。
    为了使棉花加工跟上收购工作的进展，全省各棉花加工厂从10月份以来，开展了大协作运动，互通配件有无，及时修好了一批加工机械投入生产。淮阴专区的小营、宿迁等老厂，组织技术力量到技术比较薄弱的涟水、淮安等十一个轧花厂去巡回检查，实地帮助，使这十一个厂很快投入了生产。各地还注意了对民间加工工具的充分利用。江苏主要产棉地区南通专区的六个县，由商业部门与人民公社紧密配合，建立了社办小型轧花厂五十九个，集中了一千一百余台民间轧花车轧花。如东县三十七个公社，实行土洋工具并举，把分散的轧花车集中到公社，委托供销部管理，约定时间一次把棉花轧完。海安县在距离动力轧花厂较远的棉区，建立了土轧花厂，将旧有的土轧花车加以修理装配，现在已有五十六台投入生产。全省七十多个动力轧花厂，还展开了“优质、高产、安全”的厂际竞赛。启东、海门等县的领导干部深入各轧花厂，发动群众开展厂与厂、组与组、人与人之间的劳动竞赛，各厂按日、按班组、按车台检查生产进度，使棉花的日加工量不断上升。
    江苏省从9月份新棉开始收摘以来，各地在抓轧花的同时，也做好了剥绒的准备工作，一面将损坏的和尚未配套的剥绒机加速检修配套，一面将新的剥绒机迅速调到重点工厂安装。现在全省已有90％以上的剥绒机开工剥绒，最近半个月中，已生产短绒一万二千三百多担，做到了轧花和剥绒齐头并进。
    为了及时供应各纺织厂以原棉，各地商业部门和交通运输部门协作，迅速地将新棉集中到公路、铁路、内河和长江沿线，由运输指挥部统一调度，短途送棉和长途运输、水运和陆运相结合，日夜赶运。各公社、大队都组织了运输专业组，把新棉集中到港口码头，及时运出，并充分利用回空车船运输。
    据新华社西安电　陕西省针对今年秋季阴雨多、棉花成熟晚的特点，采取随摘、随晒、随购、随加工、随调运的方法，加快了棉花收购工作，以满足纺织生产的需要。
    为了加速籽棉加工工作，在纺织系统职工的大力支援下，全省又新建了四十个轧花厂，使轧花厂总数增加到七十五个，轧花机由六十五台增加到一百六十台，旧厂也增加了动力设备，进行了技术革新，提高了加工能力。根据目前生产情况计算，今年全省所产棉花全部在这些轧花厂加工，到明年2月底能够轧完，比上一年提早三个月，还可以节约一百五十多万个劳动日。渭南县根据今年棉花集中加工的特点，合理摆布了棉花收购、加工点，采取“厂站合一”的办法，全县二十六个加工厂既加工籽棉，又收购棉花，由生产队一次把棉花就送进了轧花厂。临潼县除了把大车组织成二百零三个专业运输队以外，把架子车、自行车、小推车组成了一千七百二十个突击运棉组，不但把收购的籽棉全部送到了加工厂，而且把已轧籽的十六万斤皮棉全部调运到纺织厂。
    在三秋工作中农业劳力紧张的情况下，工、农、商、学紧密结合，互相支援，大搞协作。全省各个纺织企业在9月中旬抽调了大批干部和技术工人，先后到十二个主产棉花的县、市的公社、生产队检修棉花加工机械，帮助摘棉、售棉和加工棉花。陕棉一厂组织了厂内的车辆，一周内就帮助三原县运输棉花三百五十多担。
    据新华社郑州电　河南省许昌专区的早烟已经收完，晚烟正陆续收摘。现在全区范围内形成了一个随收摘、随加工、随收购、随调运的高潮。
    为了使已成熟的烟叶能够多收、细收，中共许昌地委在8月初就召开了县、公社、大队三级干部会议，要求适时收摘、烘烤，提高质量，片叶不丢，成熟就烘，边烘边售。全区通过多种形式，培训了分级、验级等技术员好几万人。各县、市委还领导群众开展了复收活动。中共许昌市委，动员学生和辅助劳力，突击两天收回烟头、烟杈四百三十七万多斤。
    提高烤烟质量，加快烤烟进度，是许昌地区各级党委狠抓的一个中心环节。全区已训练了烤烟技术员九万多人，开炕七千八百多个。长葛县各级党委书记亲自带头大搞试验炕，全县共搞试验炕一千多个，并创造了“炕内回潮法”，代替炕外回潮，在全县推广，使碎烟率减少了80％。襄城县广泛开展了多烤烟、烤好烟的对手赛，结果全县由日烤烟十二万多斤，猛增到一百一十二万斤。全区还普遍推广了“堆积变黄”的先进经验，把刚采下来的烟叶，放在保持一定温度的室内，使它先变黄，然后装炕。这样可以大大缩短炕烟时间，消灭青烟，提高等级，还可以节约燃煤三分之一。
    许昌专区各级商业部门，根据集中产烟区，一般产烟区，分散产烟区的不同特点，抽调五千七百多名干部，深入到生产队，建立收购网点二千五百多个，作到随加工、随收购、随成包、随调运。
