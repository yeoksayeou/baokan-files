    Political Work Requires Everyone's Participation
    Wang Rui
    Who does the factory rely on for production? This is a very simple question, and everyone will say it is relying on the workers. However, in actual work, not everyone can implement this principle well. The leading cadres of some factories have firmly grasped the work of people, while some factories have not done enough.
    The work of people cannot rely solely on administrative management, but more importantly on political work. Only by establishing strong political work in the factory can the enthusiasm of the workers be fully mobilized. With the continuous improvement of the workers' class consciousness, and everyone holding a master-of-the-house attitude, wherever the Party points, they will do it. Only in this way can the superiority of socialist enterprises be brought into play. This truth has long been confirmed by the experience of countless factories and mines. The political work experience of the Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant Party Committee and the Fengcheng Iron and Steel Plant Party Committee is another proof.
    The work of people relies on political work, and political work must go deep into the masses. First of all, the Party's policies and current political tasks (including production tasks) must be clearly explained to the masses so that they become the actions of the masses. And it is necessary to listen to the opinions of the masses and care about the practical problems of the masses. In order to achieve this, the Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant Party Committee stipulated two systems: one is to talk with workers frequently, and the other is to disclose the bottom line to the workers.
    To do a good job in political work, we cannot rely solely on a few full-time personnel. To form the situation in the Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant, we must grasp ideology at all levels and everyone must talk about politics. But how can we create this situation? According to the experience of this factory, the most important thing is to do a good job in the work of the Party and Youth League branches so that each grassroots organization, each Party member, and each League member can play their due organizational and political roles among the masses. At the same time, it is also necessary to rely on the backbone of the masses, such as relying on the old workers to unite and influence the masses.
    When political work goes deep into the masses, there will be a foundation for the work. On this basis, we can launch mass movements in production and show the power of political work in production.

    政治工作要大家来做
    王瑞
    工厂靠谁生产？这是个很简单的问题，大家都会说是依靠工人。但是在实际工作里，并不是每个人都能很好地贯彻这个原则，有的厂的领导干部紧紧抓住了人的工作，有的厂却还做的不够。
    人的工作，不能单靠行政管理，更重要的是要靠政治工作，只有在工厂里建立起坚强的政治工作，才能充分调动起工人的积极性。工人的阶级觉悟不断提高，个个抱着当家做主的态度，党指到那里，就做到那里，这才能发挥出社会主义企业的优越性。这条真理，早为无数厂矿的经验所证实，天津第三钢厂党委和丰城钢铁厂党委的政治工作经验，就是又一个证明。
    人的工作靠政治工作，政治工作就要深入群众，首先要把党的政策和当前的政治任务（包括生产任务）向群众交代清楚，使之变为群众的行动。并要倾听群众意见，关心群众切身的问题。为了做到这点，天津第三钢厂党委规定了两条制度：一是经常和工人谈心，一是向工人交底。
    政治工作要做好，不能光靠少数专职人员去办，要形成天津第三钢厂的局面，层层抓思想、人人谈政治。可是如何能造成这种局面呢？根据这个厂的经验，最重要地是做好党、团支部工作，使每个基层组织，每个党、团员，都能在群众中发挥应有的组织作用和政治作用。同时还要通过群众中的骨干，如依靠老工人去团结群众、影响群众。
    政治工作深入了群众，就有了工作的基础；在这个基础上，才能大搞生产中的群众运动，才能在生产中表现出政治工作的力量来。
