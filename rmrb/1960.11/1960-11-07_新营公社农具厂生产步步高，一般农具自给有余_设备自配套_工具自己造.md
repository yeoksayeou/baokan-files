    Beijing News - According to the Ningxia Daily, workers at the Xinying Commune Farm Implement Factory in Xiji County, Ningxia, under the leadership of the commune Party committee and with the help of the county farm implement factory, are working hard and diligently, increasing production step by step and increasing the variety of products day by day. This has enabled the entire commune to be self-sufficient in general farm implements and to support other communes, which has powerfully promoted agricultural production.
    The Xinying area used to have no industry. There were only a few blacksmiths and small furnace workers on the street. After the people's communes were organized, a farm implement factory was established. The factory has 20 workers, but its production capacity and technical level are very low. Apart from the tools they carried with them, there was no equipment. At that time, most of the farm implements and carts used by the whole commune had to be transferred from other places. But now it is very different. The factory has four major types of work: forging, casting, fitter, and carpentry. Each type of work has its own set of tools. In addition to general tools, there are also many innovative tools created by the workers themselves, such as blowers and iron melting furnaces. The workers are not only proficient in their own business, but also 80% of them can do the work of the four types of work in the factory. The output of the entire factory has increased linearly. In two years, the variety of products has increased from 19 to 47. The quality of the products has also been greatly improved. The various vehicles they produce have been unanimously praised by nearby communes.

              Good Party Committee Leadership, High Workers' Aspirations
    Such a huge change is not easy to come by. From the beginning of the factory's construction, the commune Party committee strengthened its leadership over the factory, grasped political and ideological work, and mobilized the workers to discuss the situation that most of the commune's farm implements relied on supply from other places, which affected agricultural production, thereby inspiring them to establish ambitious goals and work hard to change this situation based on the principle of self-reliance. The commune Party committee and the factory Party branch used every opportunity to organize workers to visit other places and report back for discussion. Through the visits, their horizons were broadened and their minds were liberated. In the autumn of 1958, after Party Branch Secretary Li Zijun and carpenter Lü Hongye returned from a visit and reported back, the workers said: "It seems that we are very busy all day long, saying that we are serving agriculture, but compared with others, we have not done anything. They are workers, and we are also workers. We must also produce what they can produce." In the midst of breaking superstitions and vigorously engaging in innovation, the commune Party committee and the factory Party branch vigorously supported the workers' creativity, making the workers feel that innovation was supported, so they let go and worked harder. With the encouragement and support of the Party, the employees broke through one difficulty after another in equipment, technology, raw materials, and trial production of new products, enabling the factory to grow rapidly.

              Equipment is Self-Supplied, Tools are Self-Made
    The county farm implement factory once supported them with an iron melting furnace (with a blower), a soil lathe, and other small tools. After they were transported to the factory, the workers tried every means to assemble them into a set and quickly put them into production. The biggest problem with the lathe was the lack of power. The workers focused on the word "soil" and, referring to foreign experience, used a wooden wheel made of waste grinding wheels to make a wooden winch, used waste car wheels to transform it into a transmission wheel, and used two soil gun barrels that were filed round and welded together to make a drive shaft, thus creating a hand-cranked winch to drive the lathe. In addition, the four types of work, forging, casting, fitter, and carpentry, also strengthened cooperation and made many tools, some of which were more complicated and difficult to make. The common characteristics of these tools are simple structure, using local materials, and remarkable results. For example, the fitter used two flywheels of a bicycle to refit a grinder, which increased the speed by two times.

              Teach and Learn from Each Other, Break Through Technical Barriers
    Lack of technology was a difficult problem that the workers had encountered. In the early days of the factory's construction, only six of the factory's workers were relatively skilled old ironworkers and carpenters, and most of the others were young people who were just starting to learn their craft. Even those old workers had never made larger farm implements. In order to solve this problem, the factory adopted three methods: (1) Master teaches apprentice, on-site teaching; (2) Technicians in the factory contribute their strengths, learn from each other, complement each other's experience, and improve together; (3) Visit other places to learn advanced experience. Due to on-site teaching, real swords and guns, apprentices improved very quickly, and now they have generally reached the level of ordinary workers. The factory has formed a style of learning from each other, collective research, and taking pride in humbly learning from foreign experience. No major new product in the factory has not been jointly researched and produced.

              Run Enterprises Diligently and Frugally, Save People and Materials
    This factory has consistently adhered to the policy of running the factory diligently and frugally. They first pay attention to saving labor. Due to vigorous technological innovation and improved work efficiency, the number of workers in the factory has been reduced from 48 to 28, but production has been further improved. Secondly, pay attention to saving raw materials. Raw materials, materials, and fuel are an important issue in the factory's production. When the factory was first built, there was no wood at all. The county farm implement factory had given them some help, but the factory educated employees to "not ask for help, but to tap potential locally." The workers used all wood, no matter how large, and found two skilled workers who saved wood to be responsible for cutting materials and collecting leftover materials. Other types of work promoted the carpentry approach, and broken iron was also used to make nails, door hangers, etc. on the kiln.

### 新营公社农具厂生产步步高，一般农具自给有余   设备自配套　工具自己造

    新营公社农具厂生产步步高，一般农具自给有余
    设备自配套　工具自己造
    本报讯　据宁夏日报消息：宁夏西吉县新营公社农具厂职工，在公社党委的领导和县农具厂的帮助下，发愤图强，埋头苦干，生产步步提高，品种日渐增多，使全公社做到了一般农具自给，并能支援其他公社，有力地促进了农业生产。
    新营地区过去没有什么工业。街上只有几个铁匠和小炉匠，人民公社化以后，组织起了农具厂。全厂有二十名工人，但生产能力、技术水平都很低，除了随身携带的工具外，再没有什么设备。当时，全社所用农具、车子，绝大部分要靠从外地调进。可是现在大大不同了，厂里有锻、铸、钳、木四个主要工种，每个工种都各有一套家底，除了一般用具以外，还有许多工人自己创造的革新工具，有鼓风机、化铁炉等设备。工人们不仅精通本行业务，而且80％的人都能做厂内四个工种的活。全厂产量直线上升。两年内产品品种已由十九种增加到四十七种。产品质量也大大提高，他们生产的各种车辆，受到附近各公社的一致好评。
              党委领导好　工人志气高
    这样巨大的变化，并不是容易得来的。从建厂起，公社党委就加强了对这个工厂的领导，抓紧了政治思想工作，发动工人讨论本社农具大部分靠外地供应，影响农业生产的情况，从而启发他们树立雄心，发愤图强，在自力更生的原则下，改变这种面貌。公社党委和厂党支部利用一切机会，组织工人出外参观，回来传达讨论。通过参观，开扩了眼界，解放了思想。1958年秋天，党支部书记黎自俊和木工吕鸿业出外参观回来传达以后，工人们说：看起来我们成天忙得很，说是为农业服务，可是和人家比较起来，简直没做个啥。人家是工人，我们也是工人，人家能搞的东西，我们也要搞出来。在破除迷信、大闹革新当中，公社党委和厂党支部大力支持工人的创造精神，使工人感觉到革新有撑腰的，因而更放开手干了。在党的鼓励、支持下，职工们突破了设备、技术、原材料、试制新产品等一个一个难关，使工厂迅速成长起来。
              设备自配套　工具自己造
    县农具厂曾经支援他们一座化铁炉（带一个鼓风机）、一台土车床，以及其他小工具。运到厂后，工人们千方百计把它配成套，迅速投入生产。用车床最大的难题是没有动力，工人们从“土”字上打主意，参照外地经验，用废磨的木轮，做了个木质的绞轮，用废车轮改成了传动轮，用两根土炮筒锉圆了焊接起来，做了传动轴，就这样制成了手摇绞轮来带动车床。此外，锻、铸、钳、木四个工种还加强协作，做了许多工具，其中有些还是比较复杂难做的。这些工具的共同特点是构造简单，就地取材，效果显著。如钳工用自行车的两个飞轮，改装了一副砂轮机，把转速提高了两倍。
              包教又互学　突破技术关
    缺乏技术，是工人们曾经碰到的一道难关。建厂初期，全厂工人中，只有六名是技术比较熟练的老铁工和木工，其他绝大部分都是初学手艺的青年人，就是那些老工人，也没做过较大的农具。为了解决这个问题，厂里采取了三个办法：（一）师傅带徒弟，现场教学；（二）厂内技工各献所长，互相学习，经验配套，共同提高；（三）出外参观，学习先进经验。由于现场教学，真刀真枪，徒工提高极快，现在一般都达到了普通工人的水平。厂内形成了互相学习、集体研究和以虚心学习外地经验为荣的风气。厂内重大新产品没有不是共同研究制成的。
              勤俭办企业　省人省材料
    这个厂是一贯坚持勤俭办厂方针的。他们首先注意节约劳动力，由于大搞技术革新，提高了工效，全厂工人已由四十八人减少到二十八人，但生产却更加提高了。其次注意节约原材料。原料、材料、燃料是这个厂生产中的一个重要问题。刚建厂时，一点木材也没有，县农具厂曾给他们一些帮助，但厂里教育职工“不能手心朝上，要就地取材挖潜力”。工人们不管多大的木料，都利用起来，并且找出了两个技术高、省木料的工人专门负责下料和收集剩料。其他工种推广了木工的做法，烘炉上也用碎铁打成了钉子、门吊子等。
